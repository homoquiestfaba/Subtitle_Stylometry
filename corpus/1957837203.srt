550
00:31:24,051 --> 00:31:25,252
Thank you.

551
00:31:25,285 --> 00:31:27,421
TV: The National Center for
Missing and Exploited Children

552
00:31:27,454 --> 00:31:29,022
said in 2019 they
reported more than

553
00:31:29,056 --> 00:31:33,460
421,000 missing
children to the FBI.

554
00:31:33,494 --> 00:31:35,129
- What is the biggest factor
- Horrible...

555
00:31:35,162 --> 00:31:36,930
behind these trafficking rings?

556
00:31:37,297 --> 00:31:38,566
Horrible.

557
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:40,367
Look, it's different...

558
00:31:40,401 --> 00:31:42,369
How them new meds
working for you, Ma?

559
00:31:46,039 --> 00:31:49,009
They made me feel a bit foggy

560
00:31:50,712 --> 00:31:51,912
but...

561
00:31:53,648 --> 00:31:56,483
then sometimes I can...

562
00:31:57,752 --> 00:32:00,254
remember clearly.

563
00:32:00,287 --> 00:32:03,056
The doctor said they'd
make you a bit sleepy.

564
00:32:03,658 --> 00:32:05,025
Yeah they do,

565
00:32:05,058 --> 00:32:06,594
(chuckles)

566
00:32:07,227 --> 00:32:08,362
But funny,

567
00:32:12,433 --> 00:32:15,936
I can see Diane's face

568
00:32:16,538 --> 00:32:19,306
sometimes so clearly.

569
00:32:20,441 --> 00:32:22,342
(chuckles)

570
00:32:25,245 --> 00:32:26,246
You know,

571
00:32:26,815 --> 00:32:29,684
she never liked peaches.

572
00:32:32,453 --> 00:32:34,589
Something about them,

573
00:32:34,622 --> 00:32:38,626
and she'd start
scratching her arms.

574
00:32:43,665 --> 00:32:44,965
Do you remember?

575
00:32:46,266 --> 00:32:49,403
Nah, Ma, I was a little
bit too young for that.

576
00:32:50,103 --> 00:32:53,541
You followed her around
her like a lost puppy.

577
00:32:53,741 --> 00:32:54,742
(chuckles)

578
00:32:55,442 --> 00:32:57,745
I know, that part I remember.

579
00:32:57,779 --> 00:33:02,149
She couldn't go anywhere
without you by her side.

580
00:33:09,323 --> 00:33:10,592
Breaks my heart...

581
00:33:15,095 --> 00:33:18,031
when I hear about
missing children

582
00:33:18,065 --> 00:33:19,333
on the news.

583
00:33:21,335 --> 00:33:23,538
People never recover.

584
00:33:27,709 --> 00:33:29,276
Need a blanket Ma?

585
00:33:29,309 --> 00:33:30,377
I'll get you another one.

586
00:33:30,410 --> 00:33:31,445
No..

587
00:33:31,478 --> 00:33:32,814
TV: In local news,
residents are still on edge...

588
00:33:32,847 --> 00:33:34,682
No this is fine.

589
00:33:34,716 --> 00:33:38,520
As a series of unsolved gangland
style murders continues.

590
00:33:38,553 --> 00:33:41,288
Another body with bullet wounds
was discovered earlier today

591
00:33:41,321 --> 00:33:44,826
at Palisades State Park as
police continue to follow leads

592
00:33:44,859 --> 00:33:46,059
Mr. Yost?

593
00:33:46,093 --> 00:33:47,127
And investigate.

594
00:33:47,562 --> 00:33:48,696
Who's asking?

595
00:33:50,565 --> 00:33:53,668
I was told you was the guy to
see about a straight six engine.

596
00:33:58,238 --> 00:33:59,339
Maybe.

597
00:34:00,474 --> 00:34:01,475
(sighs)

598
00:34:03,243 --> 00:34:04,646
Depends on what you're driving.

599
00:34:06,246 --> 00:34:08,550
Oh, well my pops

600
00:34:08,583 --> 00:34:09,684
gave me his old ride.

601
00:34:10,384 --> 00:34:12,754
I keep it in the
garage. You know,

602
00:34:12,787 --> 00:34:14,789
beautiful cherry red
ninety two impala.

603
00:34:15,289 --> 00:34:18,158
Decided, you know,
do a little work on it.

604
00:34:18,526 --> 00:34:19,761
You sure about that?

605
00:34:20,460 --> 00:34:21,563
Because...

606
00:34:21,963 --> 00:34:24,431
they stopped making
the straight six in ninety.

607
00:34:25,700 --> 00:34:27,702
(intense music)

608
00:34:28,435 --> 00:34:29,436
Is that right?

609
00:34:29,469 --> 00:34:31,438
You don't even know
what you're driving.

610
00:34:33,675 --> 00:34:35,777
Who was it you said
referred you to me?

611
00:34:38,680 --> 00:34:43,350
(intense music continues)

612
00:34:45,385 --> 00:34:46,688
(sound of gunshot)

613
00:34:47,855 --> 00:34:49,289
(sound of gunshot)

614
00:35:01,569 --> 00:35:02,570
(sound of gunshot)

615
00:35:02,604 --> 00:35:03,838
Ah, shit.

616
00:35:07,742 --> 00:35:08,743
(groan)

617
00:35:10,177 --> 00:35:12,312
(sound of gunshot)

618
00:35:41,809 --> 00:35:43,310
(sound of gunshot)

619
00:35:46,313 --> 00:35:47,682
(sighs)

620
00:35:47,715 --> 00:35:48,916
(groans)

621
00:35:56,289 --> 00:35:57,290
(sighs)

622
00:36:03,363 --> 00:36:04,632
(intense music)

623
00:36:04,666 --> 00:36:08,870
(grunts)

624
00:36:20,615 --> 00:36:21,716
(grunts)

625
00:36:31,926 --> 00:36:36,430
(intense music continues)

626
00:36:48,308 --> 00:36:51,012
(footsteps)

627
00:36:51,045 --> 00:36:51,913
(knocking on door)

628
00:36:51,946 --> 00:36:53,614
- Sergeant Barnes.
- Seth.

629
00:36:53,648 --> 00:36:54,782
Dakota.

630
00:36:54,816 --> 00:36:55,983
Outstanding work,

631
00:36:56,017 --> 00:36:57,885
you've been more effective
then we could've imagined.

632
00:36:58,686 --> 00:37:00,287
But...

633
00:37:00,855 --> 00:37:03,691
on this next one we're
gonna need you to...

634
00:37:04,992 --> 00:37:06,527
go a little further.

635
00:37:07,962 --> 00:37:09,329
What does that mean?

636
00:37:09,362 --> 00:37:11,566
What my brother's
trying to say is

637
00:37:11,599 --> 00:37:13,735
we're gonna need you to start
working your way up the ladder.

638
00:37:13,768 --> 00:37:15,703
The ladder? I thought
you guys had all the info.

639
00:37:16,003 --> 00:37:17,471
Not all of it.

640
00:37:17,772 --> 00:37:19,874
After a few names
the trail goes cold.

641
00:37:19,907 --> 00:37:20,908
Look, listen,

642
00:37:22,977 --> 00:37:24,979
we need you to try to...

643
00:37:25,913 --> 00:37:27,380
squeeze...

644
00:37:27,414 --> 00:37:28,950
as much information
as you can out of them,

645
00:37:28,983 --> 00:37:31,418
that way we can try to
put the pieces together

646
00:37:31,451 --> 00:37:33,253
and figure out who's
responsible for this.

647
00:37:35,556 --> 00:37:36,557
Yeah,

648
00:37:37,125 --> 00:37:38,926
you want me to squeeze
some more info out of them,

649
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:39,994
mm hmm,

650
00:37:42,329 --> 00:37:43,664
(sighs)

651
00:37:53,541 --> 00:37:54,675
You all right?

652
00:37:55,910 --> 00:37:57,779
I need you guys to
understand something.

653
00:37:59,614 --> 00:38:02,382
The service you ask for has
to be on par with the money.

654
00:38:02,415 --> 00:38:03,751
Well if it's a

655
00:38:03,785 --> 00:38:05,553
pay increase you're looking for,

656
00:38:06,621 --> 00:38:07,922
we can handle that.

657
00:38:14,862 --> 00:38:16,731
Take care of yourself, Barnes.

658
00:38:16,764 --> 00:38:21,434
(intense music)

659
00:38:25,706 --> 00:38:26,841
(door opens)

660
00:38:26,874 --> 00:38:28,308
Doc, doc.

661
00:38:28,776 --> 00:38:31,411
Man, I appreciate you
doing this for me, you know.

662
00:38:31,444 --> 00:38:33,948
Not a problem, all in a
days work. Where is she?

663
00:38:33,981 --> 00:38:35,082
Yeah she's in the truck,

664
00:38:35,116 --> 00:38:37,685
you know, she's running
a fever. It's like a 102.

665
00:38:37,718 --> 00:38:39,086
I'm just so worried about her.

666
00:38:39,120 --> 00:38:40,788
And what's your
daughter's name again?

667
00:38:40,822 --> 00:38:41,989
- Betty.
- Betty.

668
00:38:42,256 --> 00:38:43,456
Betty Hartley.

669
00:38:44,391 --> 00:38:45,626
(sound of gunshot)
(grunts)

670
00:38:45,660 --> 00:38:47,427
Jesus, Jesus Christ.

671
00:38:47,728 --> 00:38:49,864
I don't know Betty, I
swear I don't know her.

672
00:38:49,897 --> 00:38:51,833
Whatever this is, it
wasn't me, please.

673
00:38:51,866 --> 00:38:52,800
That doesn't matter, doc.

674
00:38:52,834 --> 00:38:54,635
What matters is that
you give me the names

675
00:38:54,669 --> 00:38:55,636
of the people that you're
selling the footage to.

676
00:38:55,670 --> 00:38:58,105
I don't know, I don't
know their names.

677
00:38:58,139 --> 00:39:00,074
(sound of gunshot)
(grunts)

678
00:39:00,340 --> 00:39:03,010
Emory Bastile.
Emory Bastile.

679
00:39:03,044 --> 00:39:05,947
What type of man steals
the innocence of a child?

680
00:39:06,314 --> 00:39:08,115
I never touched Betty, I swear.

681
00:39:08,381 --> 00:39:09,650
I never touched her.

682
00:39:09,684 --> 00:39:10,818
You wouldn't lie
to me would you?

683
00:39:10,852 --> 00:39:11,853
No.

684
00:39:13,154 --> 00:39:14,354
(sound of gunshot)

685
00:39:14,789 --> 00:39:17,490
(intense music continues)

686
00:39:18,759 --> 00:39:20,360
(opens door)

687
00:39:21,796 --> 00:39:23,598
(sound of engine starting)

688
00:39:47,088 --> 00:39:48,089
Yes.

689
00:39:50,825 --> 00:39:51,893
Can I help you?

690
00:39:52,593 --> 00:39:54,128
I want to know how
you've been selling

691
00:39:54,161 --> 00:39:55,096
underage content for so long

692
00:39:55,129 --> 00:39:57,565
without so much as a
warrant for your arrest.

693
00:39:59,867 --> 00:40:01,002
Don't do it.

694
00:40:09,143 --> 00:40:10,544
(opens drawer)

695
00:40:13,648 --> 00:40:14,749
Nice.

696
00:40:14,782 --> 00:40:16,183
(closes drawer)

697
00:40:16,651 --> 00:40:17,450
Tell your employees that

698
00:40:17,484 --> 00:40:19,153
they have the
rest of the day off.

699
00:40:28,729 --> 00:40:30,064
Hello, thank you.

700
00:40:32,099 --> 00:40:34,802
Let everyone know they can
take the rest of the day off.

701
00:40:37,071 --> 00:40:38,438
I'm closing up shop.

702
00:40:56,791 --> 00:40:57,792
(punch)

703
00:41:00,261 --> 00:41:02,763
(coughs)

704
00:41:05,299 --> 00:41:06,600
Listen to me,

705
00:41:08,602 --> 00:41:10,738
I'm going to ask you a
few questions, all right?

706
00:41:12,073 --> 00:41:14,575
And If you don't give
me the answers I need,

707
00:41:14,608 --> 00:41:16,544
I'm gonna continue to
hurt you, understood?

708
00:41:16,577 --> 00:41:17,545
Mm mm.

709
00:41:17,578 --> 00:41:19,146
- Understood?
- Mm-hmm.

710
00:41:22,049 --> 00:41:23,217
(breathing heavily)

711
00:41:23,250 --> 00:41:24,484
Who do you work for?

712
00:41:26,654 --> 00:41:27,688
Man,

713
00:41:29,323 --> 00:41:30,858
I don't know.

714
00:41:32,126 --> 00:41:33,127
(punch)

715
00:41:34,095 --> 00:41:35,229
(coughs)

716
00:41:36,797 --> 00:41:37,832
Who?

717
00:41:42,036 --> 00:41:43,504
Phala, man.

718
00:41:43,871 --> 00:41:45,206
Fucking Phala.

719
00:41:46,107 --> 00:41:47,108
Phala?

720
00:41:48,676 --> 00:41:49,977
His name is Phala,

721
00:41:50,611 --> 00:41:52,146
but they call him the boss.

722
00:41:52,179 --> 00:41:53,314
Where can I find him?

723
00:41:53,347 --> 00:41:55,583
(crying)

724
00:41:56,117 --> 00:41:57,985
You're putting me
in the grave man.

725
00:42:01,155 --> 00:42:03,691
(choking)

726
00:42:06,827 --> 00:42:14,568
(choking)

727
00:42:15,236 --> 00:42:17,004
(coughing)

728
00:42:18,039 --> 00:42:21,675
(breathing heavily)

729
00:42:22,643 --> 00:42:26,113
(breathing heavily)

730
00:42:28,382 --> 00:42:30,017
Where can I find him?

731
00:42:34,355 --> 00:42:35,756
He runs...

732
00:42:35,790 --> 00:42:37,158
an operation...

733
00:42:37,758 --> 00:42:40,728
for some heavy hitters
out of his restaurant...

734
00:42:41,962 --> 00:42:43,164
on Green point and

735
00:42:43,197 --> 00:42:45,032
Huron in Brooklyn.

736
00:42:46,700 --> 00:42:50,104
Don't-no, no, no, no, no, no.
(crying)

737
00:42:50,137 --> 00:42:52,940
Listen man, I'm just a courier,

738
00:42:52,973 --> 00:42:54,041
I'm a go between.

739
00:42:54,075 --> 00:42:55,876
I don't know what these
guys are doing or selling,

740
00:42:55,910 --> 00:42:58,813
they use my servers
for storage and uploads.

741
00:42:59,146 --> 00:43:02,716
I get a wire from the
Ambrose Group every month.

742
00:43:03,317 --> 00:43:05,820
- The Ambrose group?
- The Ambrose group.

743
00:43:11,392 --> 00:43:12,893
(breathes heavily)

744
00:43:12,927 --> 00:43:14,061
Good job.

745
00:43:14,895 --> 00:43:15,896
Good job,

746
00:43:17,064 --> 00:43:18,165
you did good,

747
00:43:18,599 --> 00:43:19,900
did real good.

748
00:43:22,103 --> 00:43:23,671
Okay, okay.

749
00:43:26,207 --> 00:43:27,208
(punch)

750
00:43:42,990 --> 00:43:43,991
(door closes)

751
00:43:45,059 --> 00:43:46,660
After you're clean,

752
00:43:46,694 --> 00:43:48,062
after you're clean, bud.

753
00:43:50,431 --> 00:43:52,867
(car pulling up)

754
00:43:55,769 --> 00:43:56,904
(car door opens)

755
00:43:58,806 --> 00:43:59,907
(car door opens)

756
00:44:02,843 --> 00:44:04,979
(car door closes)

757
00:44:10,918 --> 00:44:11,919
Beautiful isn't he?

758
00:44:11,952 --> 00:44:13,087
Is that the same one?

759
00:44:13,120 --> 00:44:14,121
Sure is.

760
00:44:14,623 --> 00:44:15,823
He looks healthier.

761
00:44:15,856 --> 00:44:16,957
Something wrong with him?

762
00:44:17,526 --> 00:44:20,094
Between his broken hoof and

763
00:44:20,895 --> 00:44:22,229
fractured hip, a lot,

764
00:44:22,263 --> 00:44:23,797
but he's doing good now.

765
00:44:25,099 --> 00:44:26,433
He looks strong.

766
00:44:28,736 --> 00:44:31,839
With the right support,
care and nourishment

767
00:44:31,872 --> 00:44:32,940
anything is possible.

768
00:44:34,441 --> 00:44:36,844
We've been making a
lot of progress, I mean...

769
00:44:36,877 --> 00:44:37,945
Yeah I know.

770
00:44:38,279 --> 00:44:39,947
People are beginning to notice,

771
00:44:40,481 --> 00:44:41,882
even the authorities.

772
00:44:41,916 --> 00:44:42,850
Yeah I've been tracking that.

773
00:44:42,883 --> 00:44:44,985
Then why'd you leave
a witness behind?

774
00:44:47,922 --> 00:44:48,923
He wasn't part of it.

775
00:44:48,956 --> 00:44:50,958
And you made that
assessment all on your own?

776
00:44:52,059 --> 00:44:53,093
I did.

777
00:44:54,862 --> 00:44:56,797
An intricate operation like this

778
00:44:56,830 --> 00:44:58,866
only works if all the
pieces are in place.

779
00:44:58,899 --> 00:45:00,868
I don't care if they
sweep the floor,

780
00:45:00,901 --> 00:45:02,369
if they're guilty

781
00:45:02,403 --> 00:45:03,804
we don't leave them breathing.

782
00:45:05,005 --> 00:45:06,207
That's big words coming from

783
00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:08,008
a man who's keeping
his hands clean.

784
00:45:08,510 --> 00:45:10,277
We can't afford
to get sloppy here.

785
00:45:11,912 --> 00:45:13,914
We all know how things
turn out if that happens.

786
00:45:15,316 --> 00:45:16,317
Hey,

787
00:45:16,350 --> 00:45:17,084
he's on edge,

788
00:45:17,117 --> 00:45:18,786
Nah, don't make excuses for him.

789
00:45:18,819 --> 00:45:19,954
He's a grown man.

790
00:45:29,330 --> 00:45:31,165
All things considered,
we lucked out with this guy.

791
00:45:31,198 --> 00:45:33,234
I mean, the demons
he lives with...

792
00:45:33,535 --> 00:45:34,768
What,

793
00:45:34,802 --> 00:45:36,270
shit from over in the war?

794
00:45:36,303 --> 00:45:38,839
No, his psychological
profile before he served.

795
00:45:39,507 --> 00:45:41,543
His father was killed in
an accidental shooting,

796
00:45:41,576 --> 00:45:44,411
a friendly fire incident on
base when he was ten.

797
00:45:44,445 --> 00:45:46,914
A year later when he was
11, his sister went missing.

798
00:45:46,947 --> 00:45:48,182
They found her body
under an overpass.

799
00:45:48,215 --> 00:45:50,084
He never mentioned
a sister to me.

800
00:45:51,018 --> 00:45:52,019
Maybe not.

801
00:45:52,621 --> 00:45:54,488
That's the real
reason he's doing this.

802
00:45:56,924 --> 00:45:58,225
(horse nickers)

803
00:46:00,261 --> 00:46:01,428
(horse nickers)

804
00:46:02,530 --> 00:46:03,964
Kill me?

805
00:46:03,998 --> 00:46:04,999
C'mon,

806
00:46:05,432 --> 00:46:06,800
what's the matter with you kid?

807
00:46:06,834 --> 00:46:08,135
(intense music)

808
00:46:08,168 --> 00:46:09,837
Why do you hurt little kids?

809
00:46:10,271 --> 00:46:12,306
Okay, I get it, I get it.

810
00:46:12,339 --> 00:46:14,275
Whoever sent you,

811
00:46:14,308 --> 00:46:17,311
I'll give you double what
they gave you, right now.

812
00:46:20,414 --> 00:46:22,149
What do you know
about the Ambrose group?

813
00:46:22,517 --> 00:46:23,518
Ambrose?

814
00:46:23,551 --> 00:46:25,252
Who the fuck is Ambrose?

815
00:46:25,286 --> 00:46:26,554
Are they the ones that sent you?

816
00:46:26,954 --> 00:46:28,355
Do you know who I am?

817
00:46:28,889 --> 00:46:30,424
Are you a fuckin' idiot?

818
00:46:30,457 --> 00:46:32,226
You're gonna fuck in kill me

819
00:46:32,259 --> 00:46:34,094
over a bunch of dirt faced kids?

820
00:46:34,128 --> 00:46:36,030
(sound of gunshot)

821
00:46:51,345 --> 00:46:54,415
(intense music continues)

822
00:46:55,482 --> 00:46:57,351
(startles and breathes heavily)

823
00:46:57,384 --> 00:47:05,384
(phone ringing)

824
00:47:08,929 --> 00:47:09,731
Yeah.

825
00:47:09,764 --> 00:47:11,965
Hey, come on
outside to the front.

826
00:47:12,534 --> 00:47:13,535
All right.

827
00:47:14,068 --> 00:47:15,869
Give me a few, all right.

828
00:47:19,139 --> 00:47:20,140
(sighs)

829
00:47:22,343 --> 00:47:24,078
(door opens)

830
00:47:33,187 --> 00:47:34,188
Hop in.

831
00:47:34,988 --> 00:47:36,558
- Coffee's for you...
- Thanks.

832
00:47:36,591 --> 00:47:37,592
Heard you like it black.

833
00:47:37,625 --> 00:47:38,593
Yup.

834
00:47:38,626 --> 00:47:39,728
Where we headed?

835
00:47:39,761 --> 00:47:41,962
Got to go pick up my
brother. He's waiting for us.

836
00:47:41,995 --> 00:47:45,099
(engine starts)

837
00:47:54,341 --> 00:47:56,644
(car pulling up)

838
00:47:57,545 --> 00:48:00,314
(soft music)

839
00:48:09,957 --> 00:48:11,225
What are we doing here?

840
00:48:12,025 --> 00:48:13,394
Come on, let's go.

841
00:48:18,198 --> 00:48:19,667
We got something
to show you inside.

842
00:48:32,045 --> 00:48:33,147
Think fast.

843
00:48:35,115 --> 00:48:36,684
The place is yours.

844
00:48:41,589 --> 00:48:43,625
My wife's involved
in some real estate.

845
00:48:43,658 --> 00:48:45,359
We have a couple of these,

846
00:48:45,392 --> 00:48:46,427
rent 'em out.

847
00:48:46,460 --> 00:48:48,696
Should be plenty of space
for you and your mom.

848
00:48:51,031 --> 00:48:53,066
There's an SUV in the garage.

849
00:48:53,100 --> 00:48:54,134
Registration is in your name,

850
00:48:54,168 --> 00:48:55,269
in the glove box.

851
00:48:56,738 --> 00:48:58,640
Sound like a good deal to you?

852
00:49:00,107 --> 00:49:01,141
Yeah.

853
00:49:04,612 --> 00:49:06,581
Sounds like a hell of a deal.

854
00:49:09,216 --> 00:49:12,152
Seth, enlighten us.

855
00:49:15,189 --> 00:49:16,323
Expansion.

856
00:49:18,560 --> 00:49:20,427
Jeff Douglass,

857
00:49:20,461 --> 00:49:22,229
right here in the Garden State.

858
00:49:23,297 --> 00:49:24,732
Are you serious?

859
00:49:27,034 --> 00:49:29,002
You guys have been
doing your homework.

860
00:49:29,036 --> 00:49:30,037
Mm-hmm.

861
00:49:31,071 --> 00:49:32,072
Good man there.

862
00:49:33,575 --> 00:49:36,276
Yeah, we want
you to recruit him.

863
00:49:38,278 --> 00:49:39,146
Okay.

864
00:49:39,179 --> 00:49:40,715
Look, you served with him.

865
00:49:40,748 --> 00:49:42,449
You know him better than anyone.

866
00:49:42,483 --> 00:49:45,219
So, of course we
want your input, but

867
00:49:45,252 --> 00:49:46,788
we think he's perfect.

868
00:49:46,821 --> 00:49:48,021
Oh, yeah.

869
00:49:49,557 --> 00:49:51,091
Show him the target.

870
00:50:01,435 --> 00:50:07,140
♪

871
00:50:07,174 --> 00:50:08,175
Wait

872
00:50:08,576 --> 00:50:11,546
Hold your position, Scout.
Lost in translation

873
00:50:11,579 --> 00:50:12,580
This can't be real.

874
00:50:16,149 --> 00:50:17,150
Is this legit?

875
00:50:18,485 --> 00:50:19,486
It's confirmed.

876
00:50:21,255 --> 00:50:23,156
Nah, nah, no way, man.

877
00:50:26,326 --> 00:50:27,695
What happened to your arm?

878
00:50:28,830 --> 00:50:30,230
The mark returned fire.

879
00:50:30,264 --> 00:50:31,498
Did you see a doctor?

880
00:50:31,533 --> 00:50:32,534
Yeah, me.

881
00:50:41,108 --> 00:50:42,109
You all right?

882
00:50:55,489 --> 00:50:56,691
That's our guy right there.

883
00:50:58,492 --> 00:50:59,459
Stay in the car.

884
00:51:17,712 --> 00:51:19,614
Hey there, private.

885
00:51:19,647 --> 00:51:21,849
Barnes, fuck

886
00:51:23,350 --> 00:51:24,351
whoa.

887
00:51:25,452 --> 00:51:27,154
What are you doing here?

888
00:51:27,187 --> 00:51:29,356
I could ask you the same.

889
00:51:35,462 --> 00:51:36,496
You look good.

890
00:51:37,565 --> 00:51:38,866
It's been what, like a year?

891
00:51:39,701 --> 00:51:41,368
Yeah, it's been
about a year, man.

892
00:51:45,840 --> 00:51:47,609
So what have you
been up to, huh?

893
00:51:49,343 --> 00:51:50,712
I'm busting my ass
six days a week here,

894
00:51:50,745 --> 00:51:51,846
what do you think, you know.

895
00:51:52,412 --> 00:51:55,382
Yeah, I've been doing the same.

896
00:51:55,415 --> 00:51:56,618
Fucking dishonorable moniker

897
00:51:56,651 --> 00:51:58,553
following me around,
doesn't help right?

898
00:51:59,787 --> 00:52:00,822
Yeah.

899
00:52:00,855 --> 00:52:02,356
I'm making ends meet though.

900
00:52:03,457 --> 00:52:05,325
You looking for work?

901
00:52:05,359 --> 00:52:06,493
Nah.

902
00:52:06,527 --> 00:52:08,763
Actually it's the opposite,

903
00:52:08,796 --> 00:52:10,565
something specific.

904
00:52:19,574 --> 00:52:21,743
Remember that thing we
talked about back in the day

905
00:52:22,777 --> 00:52:24,612
up in the Faryab Province?

906
00:52:24,646 --> 00:52:28,549
(background noises)

907
00:52:28,583 --> 00:52:29,851
You serious?

908
00:52:32,987 --> 00:52:34,522
It's covert.

909
00:52:35,322 --> 00:52:38,392
Pays real money, you know, a
lot better than this bullshit.

910
00:52:40,260 --> 00:52:42,764
Using your skill set.

911
00:52:42,797 --> 00:52:43,898
Real people.

912
00:52:46,668 --> 00:52:48,569
How about we talk
about this in the car?

913
00:52:48,603 --> 00:52:52,305
You know, a lot of eyes
and ears around here.

914
00:52:52,339 --> 00:52:53,240
Gimme a minute. Let me just

915
00:52:53,273 --> 00:52:55,308
tell my foreman I'm
gonna take a break.

916
00:52:58,245 --> 00:52:58,980
Jackie.

917
00:52:59,013 --> 00:53:00,148
Yeah.

918
00:53:00,180 --> 00:53:01,816
I'm gonna take a quick
break. I'll be right back.

01:05:46,346 --> 01:05:48,650
that presided over
his misconduct case.

1102
01:05:49,082 --> 01:05:50,984
Well, if you think you
might have any information

1103
01:05:51,018 --> 01:05:52,587
that could help out
our investigation

1104
01:05:52,620 --> 01:05:54,221
please feel free to contact us.

1105
01:05:54,254 --> 01:05:55,657
Absolutely. Thank you very much.

1106
01:05:56,558 --> 01:05:58,192
Thank you, congressman.

1107
01:06:01,361 --> 01:06:02,329
Sir.

1108
01:06:02,362 --> 01:06:03,731
So sorry to bother you again.

1109
01:06:05,633 --> 01:06:07,134
I personally wanted to thank you

1110
01:06:07,167 --> 01:06:09,203
for all the work that
you do for our vets.

1111
01:06:09,236 --> 01:06:11,305
I'm a former service member.

1112
01:06:11,338 --> 01:06:13,273
No, thank you for your service.

1113
01:06:13,307 --> 01:06:16,678
Absolutely. All right, good day.

1114
01:06:37,364 --> 01:06:38,432
Dakota...

1115
01:06:38,465 --> 01:06:39,466
Yeah, baby?

1116
01:06:39,501 --> 01:06:41,101
Did you know that man?

1117
01:06:43,671 --> 01:06:45,707
Behind every smart,
successful man, right...

1118
01:06:47,775 --> 01:06:49,644
Yes. Yes, I knew him.

1119
01:06:50,678 --> 01:06:51,546
I know a lot of people.

1120
01:06:51,579 --> 01:06:53,380
Can we pull off to
the next rest stop?

1121
01:06:53,848 --> 01:06:55,282
I want to grab a coffee.

1122
01:06:56,718 --> 01:06:58,553
Yeah. I need a coffee too.

1123
01:07:05,492 --> 01:07:10,030
(car pulling over)

1124
01:07:19,406 --> 01:07:20,240
Just be a second, babe.

1125
01:07:20,274 --> 01:07:21,341
Do you want anything?

1126
01:07:21,375 --> 01:07:23,377
Ah, water if you can.

1127
01:07:23,410 --> 01:07:24,512
Coming right up.

1128
01:07:31,753 --> 01:07:33,755
(sound of footsteps)

1129
01:07:43,631 --> 01:07:45,767
(sound of door closing)

1130
01:07:52,640 --> 01:07:53,808
So,

1131
01:07:54,909 --> 01:07:56,744
how do you know that FBI agent?

1132
01:07:57,277 --> 01:07:58,813
What are you talking about?

1133
01:07:59,246 --> 01:08:01,481
Kensington, the FBI
agent from the funeral.

1134
01:08:01,516 --> 01:08:02,550
How do you know her?

1135
01:08:02,584 --> 01:08:03,851
I don't know her.

1136
01:08:06,854 --> 01:08:09,323
You two looked at each other
like you fucked last night,

1137
01:08:09,356 --> 01:08:10,625
now she was introducing you

1138
01:08:10,658 --> 01:08:12,560
to her boyfriend
for the first time.

1139
01:08:12,594 --> 01:08:13,595
What?

1140
01:08:19,333 --> 01:08:20,768
Where the fuck...

1141
01:08:22,537 --> 01:08:23,605
do you know her from?

1142
01:08:29,744 --> 01:08:30,745
AA...

1143
01:08:31,244 --> 01:08:32,580
Why are you going
to AA meetings?

1144
01:08:32,614 --> 01:08:33,681
I thought we
handled that problem

1145
01:08:33,715 --> 01:08:34,649
with the rehab I paid for.

1146
01:08:34,682 --> 01:08:36,884
We did, it's the AA's
just maintenance.

1147
01:08:38,620 --> 01:08:41,254
Do we have a problem
here? I mean how the fuck..

1148
01:08:41,689 --> 01:08:42,890
You're just paranoid.

1149
01:08:42,924 --> 01:08:45,192
Paranoid? The fucking FBI

1150
01:08:45,225 --> 01:08:47,862
just showed up to fucking
funeral to question me.

1151
01:08:48,362 --> 01:08:51,131
What do you talk about
in these meetings?

1152
01:08:51,699 --> 01:08:53,200
I don't talk.

1153
01:08:53,233 --> 01:08:54,434
You go to these meetings
and you don't talk?

1154
01:08:54,468 --> 01:08:56,370
No, I don't talk.

1155
01:09:01,509 --> 01:09:02,510
Oh fuck.

1156
01:09:06,681 --> 01:09:08,783
Don't fucking lie
to me ever again.

1157
01:09:17,391 --> 01:09:20,293
(door opens and shuts)

1158
01:09:23,463 --> 01:09:25,867
(door opens and shuts)

1159
01:09:26,834 --> 01:09:28,268
So what did you think?

1160
01:09:29,037 --> 01:09:32,472
There's something there,
just not sure what it is yet.

1161
01:09:33,340 --> 01:09:34,542
Hmm. How do you figure?

1162
01:09:35,109 --> 01:09:37,612
Why the hell is the Congressman
attending this guy's funeral?

1163
01:09:37,645 --> 01:09:38,746
He hardly even knew him.

1164
01:09:38,780 --> 01:09:40,347
He's a stand up guy.

1165
01:09:40,380 --> 01:09:41,481
You're buying that?

1166
01:09:41,849 --> 01:09:42,850
Yeah,

1167
01:09:42,884 --> 01:09:44,652
Ambrose has a great record

1168
01:09:44,686 --> 01:09:46,688
of helping out the
vets and their families.

1169
01:09:46,721 --> 01:09:48,355
I mean he dedicates
all these programs,

1170
01:09:48,388 --> 01:09:51,458
that help get them back into
society once they come off tour.

1171
01:09:51,491 --> 01:09:53,393
I mean why wouldn't
he be at this funeral?

1172
01:09:54,162 --> 01:09:56,931
You're just saying that
'cause you know his brother.

1173
01:09:56,964 --> 01:09:57,965
Excuse me, who...?

1174
01:09:58,198 --> 01:10:00,501
Come on, you two
know each other.

1175
01:10:00,535 --> 01:10:02,503
What are you talking about?

1176
01:10:02,537 --> 01:10:04,505
I know you better
than I know my wife.

1177
01:10:05,006 --> 01:10:06,473
What's the deal, Dani?

1178
01:10:12,513 --> 01:10:15,016
I know him from
AA, okay, that's it...

1179
01:10:15,049 --> 01:10:16,416
AA?

1180
01:10:16,450 --> 01:10:18,720
Yes, I'm in AA. There you go.

1181
01:10:19,620 --> 01:10:21,254
How did I not know that?

1182
01:10:21,288 --> 01:10:22,389
How long you been in AA?

1183
01:10:23,057 --> 01:10:26,794
I've been in AA for three years,

1184
01:10:26,828 --> 01:10:28,563
and he's the only
one that smokes,

1185
01:10:28,596 --> 01:10:30,397
and we go outside
and we light up a ciggy

1186
01:10:30,430 --> 01:10:31,799
and we talk about things.

1187
01:10:32,299 --> 01:10:33,534
What do you talk about?

1188
01:10:34,334 --> 01:10:35,970
Mostly your wife.

1189
01:10:36,504 --> 01:10:39,507
Fuck you Dani. Fuck you.

1190
01:10:39,540 --> 01:10:40,575
Fuck you more.

1191
01:10:41,676 --> 01:10:43,276
Don't lie to me anymore, Dani.

1192
01:10:44,746 --> 01:10:45,880
You got it.

1193
01:10:49,584 --> 01:10:52,620
(sound of footsteps)

1194
01:10:52,653 --> 01:10:53,788
(knocking on the door)

1195
01:10:58,526 --> 01:10:59,627
(door opens)

1196
01:11:01,495 --> 01:11:02,864
You gonna to invite me in or...?

1197
01:11:05,465 --> 01:11:06,834
What is this, performance art?

1198
01:11:07,535 --> 01:11:09,070
You're gonna stand there
and stare at me all day long,

1199
01:11:09,103 --> 01:11:10,071
or you're gonna invite me in?

1200
01:11:10,104 --> 01:11:11,338
What are you doing here?

1201
01:11:12,740 --> 01:11:13,808
Look,

1202
01:11:13,841 --> 01:11:15,643
haven't heard
from you in a while,

1203
01:11:15,676 --> 01:11:16,978
wellness check is all.

1204
01:11:17,812 --> 01:11:19,781
Can't be depressed
all on your own, man.

1205
01:11:20,248 --> 01:11:21,616
I'm here to talk if you want.

1206
01:11:26,521 --> 01:11:27,688
I'm here to give you a gift.

1207
01:11:30,124 --> 01:11:31,491
A new phone?

1208
01:11:31,526 --> 01:11:32,492
Look, we're gonna lay low

1209
01:11:32,527 --> 01:11:34,028
for a little while,
until things cool off

1210
01:11:34,061 --> 01:11:35,797
but we got something
big in the works,

1211
01:11:35,830 --> 01:11:37,364
gonna need you to be on point.

1212
01:11:37,899 --> 01:11:38,933
Talk soon, all right.

1213
01:11:42,770 --> 01:11:43,771
Hey Seth.

1214
01:11:46,473 --> 01:11:48,009
You know that...

1215
01:11:48,042 --> 01:11:49,544
that Greek shit,

1216
01:11:51,012 --> 01:11:52,880
that shit you was talking about,

1217
01:11:52,914 --> 01:11:54,081
Theseus,

1218
01:11:55,516 --> 01:11:57,084
you really believe in it or

1219
01:11:57,518 --> 01:11:58,986
were you bullshitting me, man?

1220
01:11:59,554 --> 01:12:00,588
Yeah..

1221
01:12:01,789 --> 01:12:03,390
Yeah I believe it,

1222
01:12:04,091 --> 01:12:05,760
absolutely.

1223
01:12:08,029 --> 01:12:09,429
Okay.

1224
01:12:11,799 --> 01:12:15,536
(sound of birds chirping)

1225
01:12:18,806 --> 01:12:19,841
Let's go.

1226
01:12:31,451 --> 01:12:36,991
(indistinct chatter)

1227
01:12:37,325 --> 01:12:40,862
Good afternoon Ladies and
gentlemen, everyone who's here.

1228
01:12:40,895 --> 01:12:43,965
Sorry for interrupting
the festivities.

1229
01:12:44,497 --> 01:12:47,702
Unlike most politicians with
a podium and, a microphone.

1230
01:12:48,135 --> 01:12:50,104
I promise I'll keep it brief.

1231
01:12:50,137 --> 01:12:51,471
(laughs)

1232
01:12:51,906 --> 01:12:54,108
First I would just like to
thank each and every one

1233
01:12:54,141 --> 01:12:56,077
of you for coming out
and showing your support

1234
01:12:56,110 --> 01:12:58,411
for a cause that is
so dear to my heart.

1235
01:12:58,846 --> 01:13:00,447
Your generous contributions

1236
01:13:00,480 --> 01:13:02,717
make it possible for
us to expand access

1237
01:13:02,750 --> 01:13:07,688
to critical medical care
and programs that re-instate

1238
01:13:07,722 --> 01:13:10,091
and retrain our
nation's veterans.

1239
01:13:10,124 --> 01:13:13,060
So on behalf of all
service members

1240
01:13:13,094 --> 01:13:14,996
past, present and future

1241
01:13:15,029 --> 01:13:17,732
and the entire veterans
outreach community,

1242
01:13:17,765 --> 01:13:20,101
thank you for your
continued support,

1243
01:13:20,134 --> 01:13:21,702
we can't do it without you.

1244
01:13:21,736 --> 01:13:22,670
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

1245
01:13:22,703 --> 01:13:23,771
(applause)

1246
01:13:23,804 --> 01:13:25,472
Don't forget to tip
your bartenders.

1247
01:13:27,241 --> 01:13:28,809
- That was good, babe.
- Yeah.

1248
01:13:28,843 --> 01:13:29,844
(laughs)

1249
01:13:29,877 --> 01:13:30,878
Thanks.

1250
01:13:31,612 --> 01:13:35,883
Daddy, that was great. Also
I think you're a gentlemen.

1251
01:13:35,917 --> 01:13:37,985
I felt like a silly man.
Did I look silly?

1252
01:13:38,019 --> 01:13:39,053
No.

1253
01:13:39,086 --> 01:13:40,554
- You sure?
- No.

1254
01:13:40,588 --> 01:13:41,722
(chuckles)

1255
01:13:41,756 --> 01:13:42,757
Hold on.

1256
01:13:42,790 --> 01:13:43,925
(phone vibrates)

1257
01:13:43,958 --> 01:13:45,126
I got to take this.

1258
01:13:53,567 --> 01:13:54,969
(heavy moan)

1259
01:13:55,002 --> 01:13:56,604
(cough)

1260
01:13:58,072 --> 01:14:00,107
You fucking bitches,

1261
01:14:01,842 --> 01:14:03,110
where's my mother?

1262
01:14:03,144 --> 01:14:04,444
She's safe,

1263
01:14:05,112 --> 01:14:06,479
we're not animals,

1264
01:14:07,281 --> 01:14:09,116
we just need you to
answer some questions.

1265
01:14:10,117 --> 01:14:11,451
Do you know who I am?

1266
01:14:12,286 --> 01:14:13,554
(breathing heavily)

1267
01:14:13,587 --> 01:14:14,755
I think you do,

1268
01:14:15,556 --> 01:14:17,725
so how about you
tell me who you are?

1269
01:14:18,225 --> 01:14:19,894
I think that's fair, don't you?

1270
01:14:19,927 --> 01:14:21,595
Go fuck yourself.

1271
01:14:21,629 --> 01:14:22,663
What the fuck is this about?

1272
01:14:22,697 --> 01:14:23,831
(punch)

1273
01:14:24,865 --> 01:14:25,933
Come on buddy.

1274
01:14:25,967 --> 01:14:27,134
(coughing)

1275
01:14:27,168 --> 01:14:29,170
I'm asking the
fucking questions.

1276
01:14:29,203 --> 01:14:30,504
All of them?

1277
01:14:31,172 --> 01:14:33,774
(laugh)

1278
01:14:33,808 --> 01:14:35,576
I like you, you got balls.

1279
01:14:36,944 --> 01:14:38,012
Now tell us

1280
01:14:38,045 --> 01:14:40,581
who hired you to kill
Phala in his own restaurant?

1281
01:14:41,282 --> 01:14:42,516
You know,

1282
01:14:43,483 --> 01:14:46,120
there's a piece of paper
in the side of my jacket,

1283
01:14:46,153 --> 01:14:47,989
there's a number on it.

1284
01:14:48,522 --> 01:14:50,224
You take a look at that,

1285
01:14:50,257 --> 01:14:51,759
give it a call,

1286
01:14:52,293 --> 01:14:53,794
and while you're at it,

1287
01:14:53,828 --> 01:14:55,629
you can suck my
dick, you fuck in...

1288
01:14:56,664 --> 01:14:58,232
Let's find out
who's behind this.

1289
01:14:58,265 --> 01:14:59,499
(punch)

1290
01:15:01,902 --> 01:15:07,174
(punch)

1291
01:15:12,680 --> 01:15:15,983
(car door opens and shuts)

1292
01:15:17,852 --> 01:15:20,021
It's good to see you
again, Congressman.

1293
01:15:20,054 --> 01:15:22,189
You got your hands in a lot
of things this evening, huh?

1294
01:15:23,024 --> 01:15:24,191
Where's my guy, Frank?

1295
01:15:24,225 --> 01:15:25,893
You know who he
killed, don't you?

1296
01:15:25,926 --> 01:15:27,795
Yeah and I don't care.

1297
01:15:28,195 --> 01:15:29,163
Maybe you don't,

1298
01:15:29,196 --> 01:15:31,699
but a mutual friend is
not too happy about it.

1299
01:15:31,732 --> 01:15:32,967
How do you think I found him?

1300
01:15:33,567 --> 01:15:35,636
You could have told us
what Phala was up to.

1301
01:15:35,669 --> 01:15:37,805
We would have taken
care of it internally.

1302
01:15:37,838 --> 01:15:39,140
Let me worry about that.

1303
01:15:39,173 --> 01:15:40,274
Seth, go get him.

1304
01:15:40,708 --> 01:15:42,777
What about my
development project?

1305
01:15:42,810 --> 01:15:44,278
The guy you clipped
was running point.

1306
01:15:44,311 --> 01:15:45,980
Now I'm on the
hook for half a mil.

1307
01:15:46,180 --> 01:15:47,748
My family has
gotta eat you know.

1308
01:15:47,782 --> 01:15:48,949
How bad did you rough him up?

1309
01:15:48,983 --> 01:15:50,217
He's all right.

1310
01:15:50,251 --> 01:15:52,353
I'll raise the rest
of the financing

1311
01:15:52,386 --> 01:15:54,722
but I then I get thirty
percent of the complex.

1312
01:15:54,755 --> 01:15:55,823
My family's gotta eat too.

1313
01:15:55,856 --> 01:15:56,891
Hmm..

1314
01:15:56,924 --> 01:15:57,958
Twenty-five.

1315
01:15:57,992 --> 01:15:59,960
Thirty five, it's Section Eight.

1316
01:16:01,028 --> 01:16:02,063
Thirty percent...

1317
01:16:02,997 --> 01:16:04,265
You missed your calling,

1318
01:16:04,298 --> 01:16:06,000
you should be working for us.

1319
01:16:06,033 --> 01:16:08,302
Set it up with my secretary
and get some rest, Frank.

1320
01:16:08,769 --> 01:16:10,104
You're too old to be
roughing people up

1321
01:16:10,137 --> 01:16:11,205
in the middle of the night.

1322
01:16:11,739 --> 01:16:14,141
Just watch your step,
we all have bosses.

1323
01:16:14,475 --> 01:16:16,744
Hey, sorry for the mix up, huh?

1324
01:16:16,777 --> 01:16:18,612
Put a little ice on it,
you'll be all right.

1325
01:16:21,248 --> 01:16:22,750
(laugh)

1326
01:16:24,051 --> 01:16:25,920
Ay, ay, ay.

1327
01:16:25,953 --> 01:16:27,955
Oh, shit.

1328
01:16:30,758 --> 01:16:31,926
What bosses?

1329
01:16:31,959 --> 01:16:32,993
Get in the car.

1330
01:16:53,747 --> 01:16:54,849
All right. Here we go...

1331
01:16:54,882 --> 01:16:56,784
No, no. No.

1332
01:16:56,817 --> 01:17:01,288
(Barnes groans)

1333
01:17:01,322 --> 01:17:03,858
One, two, three.

1334
01:17:03,891 --> 01:17:09,096
(Barnes groans)

1335
01:17:09,864 --> 01:17:16,737
(breathing heavily)

1336
01:17:22,209 --> 01:17:28,215
(breathing heavily)

1337
01:17:34,955 --> 01:17:39,960
(sound of birds chirping)

1338
01:17:46,400 --> 01:17:48,068
(knocking on door)

1339
01:17:51,071 --> 01:17:53,407
Mommy, is that a package?

1340
01:17:59,013 --> 01:18:00,247
(knocks on door)

1341
01:18:08,889 --> 01:18:09,890
Can I help you?

1342
01:18:10,525 --> 01:18:12,760
Yeah, is Dakota around?

1343
01:18:13,194 --> 01:18:14,195
Mm hmm.

1344
01:18:15,095 --> 01:18:16,263
Dakota.

1345
01:18:20,367 --> 01:18:23,204
(sound of footsteps)

1346
01:18:23,237 --> 01:18:24,338
Barnes.

1347
01:18:25,139 --> 01:18:26,473
This is my wife, Sarah.

1348
01:18:26,508 --> 01:18:28,709
Sarah, this is Sergeant Barnes.

1349
01:18:29,276 --> 01:18:30,344
Nice to meet you.

1350
01:18:30,844 --> 01:18:32,246
Nice to meet you too.

1351
01:18:33,347 --> 01:18:34,882
We're just gonna go out back and

1352
01:18:34,915 --> 01:18:36,850
just chat for a
second, all right.

1353
01:18:37,351 --> 01:18:39,053
Walk around the back here.

1354
01:18:49,096 --> 01:18:50,097
(sound of door closing)

1355
01:18:54,368 --> 01:18:55,436
My fucking house?

1356
01:18:55,469 --> 01:18:56,538
Oh, it's not subtle
enough for you?

1357
01:18:56,571 --> 01:18:58,906
I can still make your
life miserable if I want to.

1358
01:18:58,939 --> 01:19:00,241
Remember what you said,

1359
01:19:00,274 --> 01:19:01,909
about life being a battlefield,

1360
01:19:01,942 --> 01:19:03,511
you can't control it
more than the weather.

1361
01:19:03,944 --> 01:19:05,479
Well, welcome
to the battlefield.

1362
01:19:06,313 --> 01:19:07,515
What are you doing here?

1363
01:19:07,549 --> 01:19:09,850
I don't appreciate
being left in the dark,

1364
01:19:10,451 --> 01:19:11,819
especially when it comes to me

1365
01:19:11,852 --> 01:19:13,921
and my mother
being in harm's way.

1366
01:19:14,355 --> 01:19:15,289
You're right,

1367
01:19:15,322 --> 01:19:16,257
totally agree,

1368
01:19:16,290 --> 01:19:18,359
it should have never
happened. I'm sorry.

1369
01:19:18,392 --> 01:19:19,193
Yeah,

1370
01:19:19,527 --> 01:19:22,263
and if I even think that
you're lying to me again,

1371
01:19:23,163 --> 01:19:24,265
I'm gonna make your life

1372
01:19:24,298 --> 01:19:26,267
a living fucking
hell, you hear me?

1373
01:19:27,234 --> 01:19:28,936
There's no road map here,

1374
01:19:28,969 --> 01:19:30,404
we're in uncharted territory.

1375
01:19:30,437 --> 01:19:31,640
- There's risks...
- Yeah...

1376
01:19:31,673 --> 01:19:33,508
but you're working for somebody
that's keeping you safe.

1377
01:19:33,541 --> 01:19:34,542
It's not that simple.

1378
01:19:34,576 --> 01:19:36,277
Who is it?

1379
01:19:36,745 --> 01:19:40,014
A silent partner who has
no interest in stepping out

1380
01:19:40,047 --> 01:19:41,315
from behind the shadows.

1381
01:19:41,348 --> 01:19:42,449
So that's it,

1382
01:19:42,850 --> 01:19:44,051
I'm a fucking lure.

1383
01:19:44,084 --> 01:19:44,785
That's it.

1384
01:19:44,818 --> 01:19:46,287
I promise I'll keep you safe.

1385
01:19:46,320 --> 01:19:47,288
Bullshit,

1386
01:19:47,321 --> 01:19:48,455
you can't keep me safe.

1387
01:19:48,489 --> 01:19:51,191
We have to navigate
carefully here.

1388
01:19:51,225 --> 01:19:52,226
Ambrose group,

1389
01:19:54,295 --> 01:19:55,262
why are they wiring money

1390
01:19:55,296 --> 01:19:58,032
to a company that's
renting server space?

1391
01:19:59,501 --> 01:20:01,802
- The Ambrose group?
- Yeah,

1392
01:20:02,570 --> 01:20:03,937
your family name,

1393
01:20:05,406 --> 01:20:08,142
it came out when I was squeezing
Emory at the server farm.

1394
01:20:09,243 --> 01:20:10,344
My father.

1395
01:20:11,045 --> 01:20:12,046
Your father?

1396
01:20:13,414 --> 01:20:15,049
He's the whole
reason I'm doing this.

1397
01:20:17,318 --> 01:20:18,319
I'm listening.

1398
01:20:20,254 --> 01:20:21,255
(breathes deeply)

1399
01:20:23,324 --> 01:20:24,491
He was a...

1400
01:20:24,858 --> 01:20:26,561
degenerate gambler,

1401
01:20:27,261 --> 01:20:28,362
a drunk,

1402
01:20:29,196 --> 01:20:30,364
real piece of shit.

1403
01:20:32,366 --> 01:20:34,968
Child pornography was a
means of earning money for him.

1404
01:20:35,002 --> 01:20:36,136
He had a group...

1405
01:20:36,170 --> 01:20:37,338
of friends, a company,

1406
01:20:37,371 --> 01:20:38,606
the Ambrose group.

1407
01:20:39,340 --> 01:20:41,609
He tried to recruit me
when I was just a kid,

1408
01:20:41,643 --> 01:20:43,143
my sister shielded me

1409
01:20:44,011 --> 01:20:45,179
and she...

1410
01:20:46,380 --> 01:20:47,981
...paid the ultimate price.

1411
01:20:48,616 --> 01:20:49,950
What happened to her?

1412
01:20:51,085 --> 01:20:52,186
They destroyed her...

1413
01:20:53,487 --> 01:20:55,189
and threw her away
like a piece of trash.

1414
01:20:55,222 --> 01:20:56,223
Your father?

1415
01:20:56,524 --> 01:20:58,593
Cancer, he died before
I could do it myself.

1416
01:20:58,959 --> 01:21:00,194
So that's it,

1417
01:21:00,829 --> 01:21:02,664
I'm here to clean
up his fucking mess.

1418
01:21:02,697 --> 01:21:04,298
He destroyed a lot of lives

1419
01:21:04,331 --> 01:21:06,200
and a lot of families and
it's still going on today.

1420
01:21:06,233 --> 01:21:07,201
If we don't...

1421
01:21:07,234 --> 01:21:08,268
Your sister...

1422
01:21:11,071 --> 01:21:12,072
Diane.

1423
01:21:15,677 --> 01:21:18,580
You better never, ever say
her name again. You hear me?

1424
01:21:18,613 --> 01:21:20,314
I found photos of her too.

1425
01:21:21,482 --> 01:21:24,418
She was the same age as my
sister when she was abducted,

1426
01:21:24,918 --> 01:21:27,454
and she suffered the
same fate. I'm so sorry.

1427
01:21:32,326 --> 01:21:33,595
Why didn't you tell me?

1428
01:21:36,196 --> 01:21:37,498
Because when I found out
what happened to my sister,

1429
01:21:37,532 --> 01:21:39,066
it didn't make it...

1430
01:21:39,099 --> 01:21:40,467
better,

1431
01:21:40,502 --> 01:21:41,536
it made it worse.

1432
01:22:12,299 --> 01:22:14,201
(sound of door opening)

1433
01:22:17,739 --> 01:22:19,339
So who's your friend?

1434
01:22:19,373 --> 01:22:21,108
Ah, just an associate at work.

1435
01:22:21,576 --> 01:22:23,277
He looked like he
wanted to kill you.

1436
01:22:23,812 --> 01:22:25,379
I'm going to go
in the other room.

1437
01:22:26,313 --> 01:22:27,214
(sighs)

1438
01:22:27,247 --> 01:22:28,348
All right okay,

1439
01:22:28,382 --> 01:22:30,017
I'm in the initial stages

1440
01:22:30,050 --> 01:22:31,653
of a new project at
the outreach office,

1441
01:22:31,686 --> 01:22:33,220
it was some trouble
and we needed to...

1442
01:22:33,253 --> 01:22:35,355
Okay, what kind of trouble?

1443
01:22:35,389 --> 01:22:37,391
Like staffing trouble.

1444
01:22:37,424 --> 01:22:39,493
Dakota, how long
do you expect me

1445
01:22:39,527 --> 01:22:41,094
to play the dumb housewife?

1446
01:22:41,428 --> 01:22:43,330
You're interrogated by
the FBI a few days ago

1447
01:22:43,363 --> 01:22:46,200
and now there's a man
coming to our door with...

1448
01:22:46,233 --> 01:22:47,702
like a busted up face.

1449
01:22:47,936 --> 01:22:49,604
What happened to his face?

1450
01:22:50,003 --> 01:22:50,839
All right maybe I'm working

1451
01:22:50,872 --> 01:22:51,840
outside the lines
a little bit here

1452
01:22:51,873 --> 01:22:54,241
- but it's to effect real change
- Daddy...

1453
01:22:54,274 --> 01:22:56,343
- Hold on sweetie.
- Can you come and help me?

1454
01:22:57,244 --> 01:22:58,312
We're fine,

1455
01:22:58,345 --> 01:23:00,113
look we're fine, there's
nothing to worry about.

1456
01:23:00,147 --> 01:23:02,349
Okay it's not "we" that
I'm worried about.

1457
01:23:03,618 --> 01:23:05,720
You know I'd never do anything

1458
01:23:05,753 --> 01:23:08,756
to put us in harm's way,
you know that. Okay?

1459
01:23:11,659 --> 01:23:12,660
I love you.

1460
01:23:12,894 --> 01:23:14,027
Daddy.

1461
01:23:14,061 --> 01:23:15,530
All right, I'm coming, sweetie.

1462
01:23:15,563 --> 01:23:18,065
Hey who are these little ones.

1463
01:23:18,098 --> 01:23:20,467
- That's Jenny.
- Jenny...

1464
01:23:20,502 --> 01:23:22,302
And this is daddy...

1465
01:23:22,336 --> 01:23:24,171
- Oh that's me.
- Yeah.

1466
01:23:25,239 --> 01:23:29,009
(ambient music)

1467
01:23:51,866 --> 01:23:53,367
I'm sorry D.

1468
01:23:56,604 --> 01:23:58,105
I know it's been a while,

1469
01:24:01,843 --> 01:24:03,811
I should have been
here sooner but...

1470
01:24:06,581 --> 01:24:08,516
I guess I was afraid.

1471
01:24:09,617 --> 01:24:12,419
Now I know that you
just didn't run away, baby,

1472
01:24:12,921 --> 01:24:14,121
you were taken...

1473
01:24:16,290 --> 01:24:18,560
and I'll get the people
that did that to you.

1474
01:24:25,900 --> 01:24:27,334
Yeah, I promise.

1475
01:24:40,414 --> 01:24:42,416
I have two names for you.

1476
01:24:43,651 --> 01:24:45,653
Gordon Pasternak

1477
01:24:45,687 --> 01:24:47,755
and Bruno Argenta.

1478
01:24:50,625 --> 01:24:52,192
I'm sorry, who are you?

1479
01:24:52,225 --> 01:24:53,595
I'm Virginia,

1480
01:24:53,628 --> 01:24:55,362
Dakota's silent partner.

1481
01:24:57,297 --> 01:24:59,834
These men were my
husband's associates

1482
01:24:59,867 --> 01:25:02,135
and they are the reason
we are here today.

1483
01:25:02,169 --> 01:25:04,338
How did you know
that I was here?

1484
01:25:04,371 --> 01:25:06,874
We have a tracker on your phone.

1485
01:25:09,343 --> 01:25:12,179
You should be proud of her.
She was very strong.

1486
01:25:12,814 --> 01:25:14,481
She tried to end
their little game.

1487
01:25:14,515 --> 01:25:17,250
She almost succeeded.
She stabbed Pasternak.

1488
01:25:18,586 --> 01:25:19,587
But...

1489
01:25:20,521 --> 01:25:22,155
they ended her life.

1490
01:25:30,364 --> 01:25:32,165
How do I know you're
telling me the truth?

1491
01:25:33,534 --> 01:25:35,670
You're not just using me
to clean up your mess?

1492
01:25:35,703 --> 01:25:38,238
My husband was a
horrible human being.

1493
01:25:38,271 --> 01:25:40,508
Even though I never
knew his victims,

1494
01:25:41,009 --> 01:25:43,845
I feel a debt owed to
those who survived.

1495
01:25:51,719 --> 01:25:53,621
These men are the
head of the snake,

1496
01:25:54,088 --> 01:25:55,957
the ring leaders
of the underground

1497
01:25:55,990 --> 01:25:58,660
child porn syndicate
on the East Coast.

1498
01:26:00,862 --> 01:26:03,731
Remember this isn't
Revenge, Sergeant Barnes.

1499
01:26:03,765 --> 01:26:05,232
It's more than that.

1500
01:26:05,967 --> 01:26:07,735
It's justice.

1501
01:26:07,769 --> 01:26:09,937
They will not be easy targets.

1502
01:26:10,303 --> 01:26:12,472
They're guarded and protected.

1503
01:26:19,914 --> 01:26:20,915
Virginia.

1504
01:26:23,283 --> 01:26:24,284
Thank you.

1505
01:26:34,327 --> 01:26:36,229
(helicopter whirring)

1506
01:26:37,031 --> 01:26:40,668
(intense music)

1507
01:26:48,275 --> 01:26:49,409
Hi, my name is Seth,

1508
01:26:49,443 --> 01:26:51,612
and I'm an alcoholic.

1509
01:26:52,013 --> 01:26:53,715
- Hi Seth.
- Hi Seth.

1510
01:26:56,517 --> 01:26:57,518
Um,

1511
01:26:59,319 --> 01:27:01,488
it's been a while right?

1512
01:27:01,956 --> 01:27:04,559
I feel like I'm
ashamed I'm even here.

1513
01:27:06,728 --> 01:27:07,662
Like I should...

1514
01:27:07,695 --> 01:27:09,396
have this thing beat somehow...

1515
01:27:09,429 --> 01:27:10,464
(chuckles)

1516
01:27:12,867 --> 01:27:14,969
like everything in
my life should be fine

1517
01:27:15,002 --> 01:27:16,971
and I should be able to
function in the world like

1518
01:27:17,004 --> 01:27:20,273
all the normal people in
the outside world out there.

1519
01:27:20,742 --> 01:27:22,810
And then I remember that I...

1520
01:27:23,511 --> 01:27:26,413
do have a problem
and all the time I spend...

1521
01:27:26,681 --> 01:27:29,550
distancing myself
from it just...

1522
01:27:30,818 --> 01:27:32,720
makes me feel like I'm less.

1523
01:27:33,921 --> 01:27:34,989
Um,

1524
01:27:37,725 --> 01:27:40,795
part of me is so used to
beating myself up that...

1525
01:27:42,395 --> 01:27:43,497
I forget that...

1526
01:27:43,998 --> 01:27:45,700
I do have options.

1527
01:27:47,735 --> 01:27:49,504
But coming here helps, so

1528
01:27:51,606 --> 01:27:52,707
thank you for that and

1529
01:27:53,174 --> 01:27:54,575
thank you for letting me share.

1530
01:27:55,643 --> 01:27:56,844
Thank you Seth.

1531
01:27:57,111 --> 01:27:58,311
Thank you.

1532
01:27:58,345 --> 01:27:59,346
Anyone else?

1533
01:28:01,983 --> 01:28:03,450
I'm Dani, I'm an alcoholic.

1534
01:28:03,985 --> 01:28:05,318
- Hi Dani.
- Hi Dani.

1535
01:28:05,853 --> 01:28:06,954
(taking a deep breath)

1536
01:28:06,988 --> 01:28:10,792
Ooh I'm struggling
today guys, I'm struggling...

1537
01:28:12,026 --> 01:28:13,795
I'm struggling with a secret.

1538
01:28:15,596 --> 01:28:16,864
We all know

1539
01:28:16,898 --> 01:28:18,766
how we're only as sick
as our secrets, right?

1540
01:28:20,768 --> 01:28:22,469
So I'm here to tell on myself.

1541
01:28:22,970 --> 01:28:24,005
I'm in a place in my life where

1542
01:28:24,038 --> 01:28:24,972
I'm trying to reconcile

1543
01:28:25,006 --> 01:28:27,041
my professional life
and my personal life,

1544
01:28:27,074 --> 01:28:28,943
and I'm just having
a really tough time

1545
01:28:28,976 --> 01:28:30,578
bridging the gap that I just,

1546
01:28:31,879 --> 01:28:34,447
it's so frustrating you know.

1547
01:28:34,949 --> 01:28:35,917
(sighs)

1548
01:28:35,950 --> 01:28:37,985
And I'm trying so hard not to

1549
01:28:38,351 --> 01:28:40,087
beat myself up and,

1550
01:28:40,555 --> 01:28:42,123
you know come down on myself and

1551
01:28:42,156 --> 01:28:44,457
be mad that I'm not
showing up for myself.

1552
01:28:45,159 --> 01:28:47,995
Because we all know
it's about progress

1553
01:28:48,029 --> 01:28:49,597
not perfection, right?

1554
01:28:49,931 --> 01:28:51,532
But it is so hard,

1555
01:28:52,967 --> 01:28:55,937
that I just think for a
nanosecond just one drink,

1556
01:28:56,604 --> 01:28:58,606
just one. Why,

1557
01:28:58,639 --> 01:29:00,141
why can't I have one?

1558
01:29:00,174 --> 01:29:02,677
Why can't I be normal
like everybody else?

1559
01:29:02,710 --> 01:29:04,045
But I can't have one.

1560
01:29:04,078 --> 01:29:04,745
(sobbing)

1561
01:29:04,779 --> 01:29:06,647
It's a disease inside of me

1562
01:29:06,681 --> 01:29:08,616
and I just have
to remember that.

1563
01:29:10,151 --> 01:29:10,985
I'm real sorry.

1564
01:29:11,018 --> 01:29:13,453
I just needed
to share and get this...

1565
01:29:15,022 --> 01:29:16,691
ugly secret out.

1566
01:29:16,724 --> 01:29:18,926
So thank you for letting
me share, you guys.

1567
01:29:18,960 --> 01:29:20,628
- Thank you Dani.
- Thank you.

1568
01:29:24,732 --> 01:29:25,700
Hey.

1569
01:29:25,733 --> 01:29:26,767
Hey.

1570
01:29:27,101 --> 01:29:29,369
(sound of footsteps)

1571
01:29:29,570 --> 01:29:31,172
You know you
can still talk to me.

1572
01:29:31,205 --> 01:29:32,340
Thanks...

1573
01:29:32,372 --> 01:29:34,876
and it's a bit fucking
awkward though, isn't it?

1574
01:29:35,810 --> 01:29:38,012
(lighting a cigarette )

1575
01:29:40,447 --> 01:29:42,016
You did good in
your share tonight.

1576
01:29:42,415 --> 01:29:44,018
Thank you, it's been a while.

1577
01:29:44,451 --> 01:29:46,053
You too, it really helped.

1578
01:29:46,821 --> 01:29:47,822
Good...

1579
01:29:50,858 --> 01:29:53,794
you know, questioning your
brother was a formality, right?

1580
01:29:54,629 --> 01:29:55,663
We questioned everybody

1581
01:29:55,696 --> 01:29:56,998
at the cemetery that day.

1582
01:29:58,232 --> 01:29:59,767
Should you really
be talking to me

1583
01:29:59,800 --> 01:30:01,669
about an ongoing investigation?

1584
01:30:01,702 --> 01:30:02,503
No.

1585
01:30:02,536 --> 01:30:03,571
- Hey.
- Yeah.

1586
01:30:04,105 --> 01:30:05,139
Hey. I called you,

1587
01:30:05,172 --> 01:30:06,439
- you didn't pick up.
- You did?

1588
01:30:06,473 --> 01:30:08,776
I turn my phone
off during meetings.

1589
01:30:08,809 --> 01:30:09,944
Hey what did you call me for?

1590
01:30:10,711 --> 01:30:11,712
Dani.

1591
01:30:13,047 --> 01:30:14,015
Barnes.

1592
01:30:14,048 --> 01:30:15,116
You guys are friends?

1593
01:30:15,149 --> 01:30:17,051
Yeah, this is Barnes...

1594
01:30:17,351 --> 01:30:19,520
- I'm sorry. We got to go.
- We go way back.

1595
01:30:19,787 --> 01:30:20,788
Okay,

1596
01:30:21,122 --> 01:30:23,057
next week. I'll
see you next week.

1597
01:30:24,091 --> 01:30:25,226
- All right.
- Okay.

1598
01:30:25,259 --> 01:30:27,828
Catch you next week.

1599
01:30:27,862 --> 01:30:33,100
(sound of footsteps)

1600
01:30:33,668 --> 01:30:35,435
Long Island City, Queens.

1601
01:30:35,937 --> 01:30:37,470
The child pornography
ring is run out

1602
01:30:37,505 --> 01:30:39,106
of the back office
in the warehouse.

1603
01:30:39,140 --> 01:30:40,908
Now the place is
like a fucking fortress,

1604
01:30:41,208 --> 01:30:42,576
they got men at the doors,

1605
01:30:43,010 --> 01:30:45,613
the corridors, and
the inner sanctum.

1606
01:30:47,581 --> 01:30:49,183
Now they got a house
out in Montauk where

1607
01:30:49,216 --> 01:30:50,618
they shoot these films but this,

1608
01:30:51,285 --> 01:30:52,887
this is their distribution hub.

1609
01:30:54,855 --> 01:30:55,990
Let me see.

1610
01:30:58,759 --> 01:31:00,828
Yeah it's a two man job.

1611
01:31:02,163 --> 01:31:03,496
Fucking disgusting.

1612
01:31:04,832 --> 01:31:07,068
I got Jeff, he's
ready and willing.

1613
01:31:10,171 --> 01:31:11,939
Do me a favor and
make examples of them.

1614
01:31:12,573 --> 01:31:13,708
No, no,

1615
01:31:13,741 --> 01:31:15,810
we're not going to be making
examples out of anyone.

1616
01:31:16,010 --> 01:31:17,178
Listen, I want it brutal,

1617
01:31:17,211 --> 01:31:18,746
I want it ugly, I
want it painful.

1618
01:31:18,779 --> 01:31:20,915
Look, regardless, two
men are gonna be dead,

1619
01:31:20,948 --> 01:31:22,917
but it's gonna raise
a lot more red flags if

1620
01:31:22,950 --> 01:31:24,484
we make more of
it than we need to.

1621
01:31:24,819 --> 01:31:26,153
So like I said,

1622
01:31:26,187 --> 01:31:28,622
we do it quickly
and we do it quietly.

1623
01:31:29,090 --> 01:31:31,491
- You keep saying, "we."
- Yeah,

1624
01:31:32,994 --> 01:31:34,061
I want to be in on this one.

1625
01:31:34,562 --> 01:31:36,864
- They could kill you.
- You don't think I know that...

1626
01:31:37,732 --> 01:31:40,067
I'm there... I'm ready.

1627
01:31:44,972 --> 01:31:45,973
(chuckles)

1628
01:31:47,742 --> 01:31:48,743
(chuckles)

1629
01:31:50,945 --> 01:31:53,614
Big bad-ass criminal
mastermind, look at you.

1630
01:31:54,382 --> 01:31:56,584
Ready to step out
from behind the curtain, huh?

1631
01:31:56,617 --> 01:31:57,618
Mm hmm.

1632
01:31:59,587 --> 01:32:00,654
You ever held a gun?

1633
01:32:02,256 --> 01:32:03,257
No.

1634
01:32:05,626 --> 01:32:06,727
We're not criminals,

1635
01:32:08,129 --> 01:32:10,264
we're sanitation workers
taking out the trash.

1636
01:32:11,265 --> 01:32:12,700
I'm a criminal, remember?

1637
01:32:13,067 --> 01:32:16,570
(laugh)

1638
01:32:18,339 --> 01:32:20,574
Rip their fucking
hearts out for me.

01:32:38,659 --> 01:32:40,161
- Gordo.
- Yeah.

1642
01:32:40,529 --> 01:32:42,863
I'm having an issue with
the credit card processor

1643

coming through our tri server.

1644

- Well can you fix it?
- I'm trying.

1645
01:32:46,667 --> 01:32:47,502
Which film?

1646
01:32:47,536 --> 01:32:49,003
How many downloads
we talking about?

1647
01:32:49,036 --> 01:32:50,171
Give me a figure over here.

(beep sound from computer)

1651
01:32:56,911 --> 01:32:58,946
People are getting
charged for extra videos,

1652
01:32:59,380 --> 01:33:01,115
and they're not
getting any playback.

1653
01:33:01,615 --> 01:33:03,317
All right contact the buyers and

1654
01:33:03,350 --> 01:33:04,718
tell them we're working on it.

1655
01:33:04,752 --> 01:33:06,087
Okay I'm on it.

1656
01:33:10,658 --> 01:33:11,659
All right.

1657
01:33:26,707 --> 01:33:27,708
Hey.

1658
01:33:28,375 --> 01:33:29,844
Maybe you should
stay in the car.

1659
01:33:31,946 --> 01:33:33,047
I'm fucking here...

1660
01:33:33,080 --> 01:33:35,349

what the fuck to do anymore.

1661
01:33:36,917 --> 01:33:37,918
Okay.

1662
01:33:39,153 --> 01:33:40,354
(sound of reloading gun)

1663
01:33:41,088 --> 01:33:42,089
Okay.

1664
01:33:44,291 --> 01:33:45,292
Remember what I told you,

1665
01:33:47,027 --> 01:33:48,829
keep two hands
on that bitch, all right?

1666
01:33:50,965 --> 01:33:51,966
Stay close,

1667
01:33:52,733 --> 01:33:53,734
stay tight,

1668
01:33:54,268 --> 01:33:58,339
remember slow

01:34:04,011 --> 01:34:05,012
I got it.

1672
01:34:06,180 --> 01:34:07,181
Okay.

1673
01:34:07,882 --> 01:34:08,883
I got it.

1674
01:34:10,718 --> 01:34:11,719
All right.

1675
01:34:17,258 --> 01:34:19,026
Just don't point
that thing at me.

1676
01:34:21,962 --> 01:34:28,302

Jeff.

Don't move.

1698
01:37:27,414 --> 01:37:30,217
You two, get up, now!

1699
01:37:31,085 --> 01:37:32,419
Against the wall.

1700
01:37:32,453 --> 01:37:34,221
(door opens)

1701
01:37:34,254 --> 01:37:35,389
(door closes)

1702
01:37:42,930 --> 01:37:44,365
What the fuck is this?

1703
01:37:48,969 --> 01:37:51,038
This is for killing my sister.

1704
01:37:51,573 --> 01:37:54,475
And walking around in the
world like she doesn't matter.

1705
01:37:54,509 --> 01:37:56,511
We got money, we
got money, take it all!

1706
01:37:59,647 --> 01:38:01,181
Fuck you.

1707
01:38:01,215 --> 01:38:02,349
(sound of gun shot)

1708
01:38:16,263 --> 01:38:17,565
And his sister too.

1709
01:38:20,602 --> 01:38:22,169
(sound of gun shot)

1710
01:39:16,457 --> 01:39:18,358
(breathes heavily)

1711
01:39:20,027 --> 01:39:22,129
Come on, pick
up, pick up, pick up.

1712
01:39:23,197 --> 01:39:24,298
Hey! Is Jenny with you?

1713
01:39:24,331 --> 01:39:26,200
Is everything all right?
Where are you?

1714
01:39:26,233 --> 01:39:27,735
We're home, she's right here.

1715
01:39:28,335 --> 01:39:30,572
What's going on with you?
(unknown incoming call)

1716
01:39:31,338 --> 01:39:32,439
Dakota?

1717
01:39:33,273 --> 01:39:35,375
I got another call
coming in, I gotta go.

1718
01:39:35,409 --> 01:39:37,478
I'll be home in a bit.
I just got take out.

1719
01:39:37,512 --> 01:39:38,546
Love you.

1720
01:39:40,782 --> 01:39:41,816
Hello?

1721
01:39:41,850 --> 01:39:44,719
Your daughter is safe
but you already know that.

1722
01:39:45,252 --> 01:39:46,621
Do I have your attention?

1723
01:39:47,087 --> 01:39:48,355
What do you want?

1724
01:39:48,388 --> 01:39:51,158
Always so tense,
you should smile more.

1725
01:39:51,191 --> 01:39:53,393
You're much more
charming when you smile.

1726
01:39:53,427 --> 01:39:55,095
You touch her, I
swear to fucking God.

1727
01:39:55,128 --> 01:39:57,765
I would never touch
the Governor's daughter.

1728
01:39:59,634 --> 01:40:00,635
Governor?

1729
01:40:00,668 --> 01:40:03,337
Yes, Governor Ambrose.

1730
01:40:03,370 --> 01:40:05,239
Has a nice ring
to it, doesn't it?

1731
01:40:05,272 --> 01:40:08,710
Just dangling at
the tip of my fingers.

1732
01:40:09,443 --> 01:40:13,280
You can't just run around
sanctioning evil, Mr. Ambrose.

1733
01:40:13,848 --> 01:40:15,415
That blank check I gave you

1734
01:40:15,449 --> 01:40:17,752
for your little adventures
came at a price.

1735
01:40:19,119 --> 01:40:20,822
I think you should come see me.

1736
01:40:20,855 --> 01:40:22,055
Coming right now.

1737
01:40:24,191 --> 01:40:25,693
(phone hangs up)

1738
01:40:30,297 --> 01:40:32,499
(sighs)

1739
01:40:35,703 --> 01:40:37,705
(slamming the steering wheel)
Fuck.

1740
01:40:51,553 --> 01:40:55,723
(cellphone rings)

1741
01:40:56,691 --> 01:40:57,625
Yeah.

1742
01:40:57,659 --> 01:40:59,594
I need you to come
meet me it's important.

1743
01:40:59,627 --> 01:41:01,161
I'll text you the address.

1744
01:41:01,194 --> 01:41:02,195
Got it.

1745
01:41:16,476 --> 01:41:18,412
Where you going now?

1746
01:41:18,445 --> 01:41:19,647
Gotta go, Ma.

1747
01:41:19,681 --> 01:41:20,748
(Kisses)

1748
01:41:21,649 --> 01:41:22,717
Vitamin C.

1749
01:41:22,750 --> 01:41:24,117
Mm Hmm.

1750
01:41:24,886 --> 01:41:29,757
(car pulling over)

1751
01:41:31,325 --> 01:41:35,362
(sound of birds chirping)

1752
01:41:36,731 --> 01:41:38,298
(car door opening)

1753
01:41:50,678 --> 01:41:51,779
Dakota...

1754
01:41:52,747 --> 01:41:54,314
I did some thinking.

1755
01:41:55,148 --> 01:41:57,752
I'm more comfortable with
twenty percent on our deal.

1756
01:41:58,586 --> 01:42:00,153
She's waiting for you.

1757
01:42:02,222 --> 01:42:04,424
(sound of door opening)

1758
01:42:06,326 --> 01:42:08,161
No hard feelings huh?

1759
01:42:12,366 --> 01:42:13,601
(sound of door closing)

1760
01:42:36,858 --> 01:42:39,794
This is the first building
I ever purchased.

1761
01:42:41,261 --> 01:42:42,195
When I found it

1762
01:42:42,229 --> 01:42:44,331
I knew the property
value was in the gutter,

1763
01:42:44,364 --> 01:42:46,834
but even then I could tell
it was worth something.

1764
01:42:47,602 --> 01:42:51,673
You see gentlemen, I have a
knack for recognizing value.

1765
01:42:51,706 --> 01:42:52,840
You for instance.

1766
01:42:53,340 --> 01:42:57,244
When I found you toiling as a
clerk in the halls of Congress,

1767
01:42:57,277 --> 01:42:58,713
you were useless,

1768
01:42:58,746 --> 01:43:03,283
And now you're a powerful
Congressman, future Governor.

1769
01:43:03,316 --> 01:43:06,486
In that way you remind
me of my late husband.

1770
01:43:06,521 --> 01:43:09,256
And like him you
have a weakness,

1771
01:43:09,657 --> 01:43:11,291
which brings us to you.

1772
01:43:11,893 --> 01:43:13,761
The recovering drunk,

1773
01:43:13,795 --> 01:43:16,329
a liability you should've
paid more attention to.

1774
01:43:16,363 --> 01:43:17,632
But you did serve your purpose.

1775
01:43:18,298 --> 01:43:22,335
Because of you, I have
a rather shocking video

1776
01:43:22,369 --> 01:43:24,639
...of an American
politician's brother

1777
01:43:24,672 --> 01:43:27,374
directly involved in
the ruthless murder

1778
01:43:27,407 --> 01:43:29,476
...of a helpless man.

1779
01:43:30,111 --> 01:43:33,981
Ordered and sanctioned
by so said politician.

1780
01:43:36,517 --> 01:43:37,785
Your "AA Buddy"

1781
01:43:38,653 --> 01:43:41,622
...my niece "Dani",

1782
01:43:41,656 --> 01:43:44,826
happens to be very
handy with a smart phone.

1783
01:43:46,293 --> 01:43:47,628
Now,

1784
01:43:47,662 --> 01:43:49,329
Mr. Ambrose.

1785
01:43:49,864 --> 01:43:52,934
Can you guess
what's in my pocket?

1786
01:43:54,569 --> 01:43:55,536
No.

1787
01:43:55,570 --> 01:43:56,771
You are.

1788
01:43:57,772 --> 01:43:58,940
As you climb the ladder,

1789
01:43:58,973 --> 01:44:02,375
you'll come to realize that
the rent is paid in favors.

1790
01:44:03,310 --> 01:44:06,047
And now, most importantly,
you, Sergeant Barnes,

1791
01:44:06,080 --> 01:44:07,280
a true hero.

1792
01:44:07,314 --> 01:44:10,718
I think I speak for myself and
the future Governor Ambrose

1793
01:44:10,752 --> 01:44:13,755
when I thank you
for clearing our name.

1794
01:44:13,788 --> 01:44:16,389
The politician wouldn't have
a future if it wasn't for you.

1795
01:44:16,423 --> 01:44:18,559
I'd say we're indebted,

1796
01:44:18,593 --> 01:44:20,995
but I think Ambrose
already knows that.

1797
01:44:21,929 --> 01:44:26,701
Now, if you all want to stay out
of prison and above ground, then

1798
01:44:27,702 --> 01:44:29,436
I'm your only option.

1799
01:44:30,337 --> 01:44:31,606
The way I see it...

1800
01:44:32,339 --> 01:44:35,777
you'll be doing my
bidding from here on out.

1801
01:44:37,779 --> 01:44:38,913
Gentlemen.

1802
01:44:39,714 --> 01:44:40,948
(laugh)

1803
01:44:46,754 --> 01:44:48,455
(sound of door opening)

1804
01:44:53,895 --> 01:44:54,896
(sound of door closing)

1805
01:44:56,664 --> 01:44:57,665
Can we talk?

1806
01:44:58,199 --> 01:45:01,068
I feel like there's a lot to
talk about after that, right?

1807
01:45:01,102 --> 01:45:02,703
Congressional
recess is over, Seth.

1808
01:45:02,737 --> 01:45:04,437
I got to get back
to the Capitol.

1809
01:45:05,006 --> 01:45:07,708
Hey, I'll reach out soon,

1810
01:45:08,609 --> 01:45:09,944
stay out of trouble.

1811
01:45:12,980 --> 01:45:14,649
Trouble won't find me.

1812
01:45:15,516 --> 01:45:16,651
I know that's right.
