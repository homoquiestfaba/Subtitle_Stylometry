1
00:00:17,584 --> 00:00:20,286
(GUNSHOT)

2
00:00:24,223 --> 00:00:28,259
Darling, listen to this.
In the "It Had to Happen"
department:

3
00:00:28,327 --> 00:00:30,630
"During <i> Die Walkure</i> at the
Sydney Opera House..."

4
00:00:30,697 --> 00:00:32,198
During the what?

5
00:00:32,265 --> 00:00:36,402
<i> Die</i> Valkyrie, you know, pum
 pum pa pum pum!

6
00:00:36,469 --> 00:00:40,507
Just as Siegmund pulled out
his father's sword and
Sieglinde swooned,

7
00:00:40,573 --> 00:00:42,575
the phone rang

8
00:00:42,642 --> 00:00:46,312
in row G. A woman removed a
cellular from her evening bag
and handed it to her husband.

9
00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:50,683
To the outrage of the
neighboring Wagnerites,
he took the call.

10
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:52,886
-(PHONE RINGING)
-Speaking of which.

11
00:00:55,354 --> 00:00:56,888
-Yes?
-MAN: <i> Your secretary,
 Mr. Hart.</i>

12
00:00:56,956 --> 00:00:57,957
It's Liz.

13
00:00:58,858 --> 00:01:01,260
Ask her how Freeway is.

14
00:01:01,326 --> 00:01:03,696
Hi, Liz. Yeah, great.

15
00:01:03,763 --> 00:01:08,401
How is... Oh, he is. He does?

16
00:01:10,102 --> 00:01:11,371
He wants to speak with you.

17
00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:19,345
-Freeway! Hello, baby!
I miss you!
-(DOG BARKING)

18
00:01:19,412 --> 00:01:24,617
You wouldn't have liked
quarantine, though, I promise.
(KISSES) I love you.

19
00:01:24,683 --> 00:01:26,586
-(WHIMPERING)
-Tell him you love him.

20
00:01:26,653 --> 00:01:28,487
-I love you, Freeway.
-(WHIMPERING)

21
00:01:28,554 --> 00:01:32,091
So long, now.
You be a good boy. Bye bye.

22
00:01:32,157 --> 00:01:35,994
Ah, Liz. Anything else of
major importance?

23
00:01:36,061 --> 00:01:42,168
You rented the car for us.
And you got a Jag. Wonderful.

24
00:01:42,235 --> 00:01:46,438
All right, we'll talk to you
tomorrow. Thank you very much.
Bye.

25
00:01:46,505 --> 00:01:48,741
Isn't this magnificent?

26
00:01:48,808 --> 00:01:52,912
Yeah. And in living black and
white. Wait till you clamp
an eye on the real thing.

27
00:01:59,018 --> 00:02:04,123
I realize that it is not your
favorite thing to sit through
six hours of Wagner.

28
00:02:04,190 --> 00:02:09,661
So, have I thanked you enough
for getting the opera tickets?

29
00:02:09,728 --> 00:02:11,330
-Oh, yes!
-Have I?

30
00:02:11,397 --> 00:02:13,265
Are you sure?

31
00:02:13,332 --> 00:02:16,567
Uh huh, and I never get tired
of the way you show
your appreciation.

32
00:02:16,635 --> 00:02:17,904
How do I do that?

33
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:31,117
I feel really good about what
we're doing.

34
00:02:31,184 --> 00:02:36,622
-Going to the opera?
-No, no! By buying the
game reserve.

35
00:02:36,689 --> 00:02:40,126
It's going to be very
interesting to see
Elliott Manning again.

36
00:02:40,193 --> 00:02:41,627
After all these years.

37
00:02:41,694 --> 00:02:43,228
Yeah, won't it.

38
00:02:43,295 --> 00:02:45,497
Who would have ever guessed
that he'd wind up owning

39
00:02:45,564 --> 00:02:49,035
the world's largest private
game reserve and that we'd be
buying it.

40
00:02:49,102 --> 00:02:53,572
We don't own it yet. Don't
forget we've been working on
this thing for over a month

41
00:02:53,639 --> 00:02:57,110
and he insisted that we come
down here. You know, he drives
a hard bargain.

42
00:02:58,311 --> 00:03:01,047
He always did have a
mean streak.

43
00:03:01,113 --> 00:03:04,651
Maybe that's why he offered me
the deal.

44
00:03:04,717 --> 00:03:07,420
He wants to punish me for
taking you away from him.

45
00:03:09,055 --> 00:03:14,460
You didn't take me away from
him. You swept me off my feet.

46
00:03:17,163 --> 00:03:18,665
And look where it got me.

47
00:03:25,804 --> 00:03:28,173
JENNIFER: It really is
magnificent.

48
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:30,043
JONATHAN: And in living color.

49
00:04:09,181 --> 00:04:12,919
-(SCREAMING) Darling, darling!
-What's the matter?

50
00:04:12,985 --> 00:04:15,287
Just hug the white line.

51
00:04:15,354 --> 00:04:17,956
You don't think I know how to
drive on the wrong side of
the road?

52
00:04:18,023 --> 00:04:22,828
I didn't say that. It's just
that you almost kissed that
parked car back there.

53
00:04:22,895 --> 00:04:25,097
All right, I'll hug instead
of kiss.

54
00:04:26,599 --> 00:04:29,801
Elliott must own this part of
town. His name is everywhere.

55
00:04:29,868 --> 00:04:33,506
Well, the rumor is that his
empire is on shaky ground.

56
00:04:33,572 --> 00:04:38,644
Really? Huh! Well, now that's
more like the Elliott
I once knew.

57
00:04:38,710 --> 00:04:42,647
He tries to box your ears when
he's on the defensive.

58
00:04:42,715 --> 00:04:46,152
Maybe that's why he sent me
a kangaroo for a
wedding present.

59
00:04:46,218 --> 00:04:48,421
So he could box my ears.

60
00:04:48,488 --> 00:04:52,158
Well, if we get the game
reserve, you can send him a
whole flock of kangaroos

61
00:04:52,224 --> 00:04:53,226
to box his.

62
00:04:53,292 --> 00:04:54,294
A flock of kangaroos?

63
00:04:56,996 --> 00:05:01,433
A passel?
A passel of kangaroos?
A gaggle!

64
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:04,069
JONATHAN: A gaggle of
kangaroos.

65
00:05:04,136 --> 00:05:05,738
-Hoard.
-A hoard?

66
00:05:05,804 --> 00:05:06,804
-Herd.
-A herd.

67
00:05:06,872 --> 00:05:09,108
A herd. A hoard.

68
00:05:20,119 --> 00:05:22,288
Welcome to the
InterContinental Sydney,
Ma'am.

69
00:05:22,355 --> 00:05:26,426
-JENNIFER: Thank you.
-JONATHAN: Thanks.

70
00:05:29,428 --> 00:05:32,465
Did you know this hotel used
to be the Treasury Building?

71
00:05:32,531 --> 00:05:34,033
Maybe we can get a loan.

72
00:05:42,375 --> 00:05:47,580
G'day! My name's Johnny. Call
me "Johnny on the Spot." I'll
be serving you any way I can.

73
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:52,318
Well, my name's Johnny, too,
but not on the spot.
Not yet, anyway.

74
00:05:52,385 --> 00:05:56,322
The hotel registration's just
across the lobby. I'll take
care of the rest of your bags.

75
00:05:57,490 --> 00:05:59,525
Thanks, Johnny.
Do I hit the spot?

76
00:06:00,793 --> 00:06:05,431
Absolutely, Sir!
Thank you very much, indeed.

77
00:06:08,868 --> 00:06:12,838
Hello, Mr. and Mrs. Hart. I'm
Lisa Brandt, PR director
for Manning Enterprises.

78
00:06:12,905 --> 00:06:14,340
-How do you do?
-Miss Brant.

79
00:06:14,406 --> 00:06:17,409
Lisa, please. Mr. Manning
wants you to be his guests.

80
00:06:17,476 --> 00:06:21,914
-Oh?
-Well, it is his hotel.
Thank you.

81
00:06:21,981 --> 00:06:25,484
No, not at his hotel.
At his house.

82
00:06:25,551 --> 00:06:31,188
-At his house.
-Oh, that's very kind, but I'm
sure we'll be fine here.

83
00:06:31,256 --> 00:06:34,126
Oh, don't get me into trouble
with Mr. Manning.

84
00:06:34,193 --> 00:06:36,195
He would never forgive me
if I didn't bring you back.

85
00:06:38,097 --> 00:06:43,269
-Darling?
-Well, we wouldn't want to
get you in trouble.

86
00:06:44,804 --> 00:06:47,239
Johnny, put the Harts' luggage
in my car, please.

87
00:06:47,306 --> 00:06:51,144
-We have our own car.
-Oh, good. Then why don't you
just follow me?

88
00:07:11,297 --> 00:07:12,465
Good shot!

89
00:07:13,432 --> 00:07:15,267
Hi!

90
00:07:15,334 --> 00:07:18,070
-Ah!
-Uh huh!

91
00:07:20,539 --> 00:07:21,607
There they are.

92
00:07:21,674 --> 00:07:24,008
-Elliott!
-Jennifer! Welcome!

93
00:07:24,076 --> 00:07:27,513
-Nice to see you again.
-You have no idea.

94
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:29,448
You guys look great! Jonathan.

95
00:07:29,515 --> 00:07:32,183
Elliott. Good to see you.
Thanks for putting us up here.

96
00:07:32,251 --> 00:07:35,186
I don't want you out of
my sight.

97
00:07:35,254 --> 00:07:38,524
Tonga, I want you to meet my
very old friends, the Harts.

98
00:07:38,591 --> 00:07:41,060
-Mm-hm.
-How do you do?

99
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:43,695
Mmm.

100
00:07:43,762 --> 00:07:46,532
Among other things, Mr. Hart
is a great competitor.

101
00:07:46,599 --> 00:07:51,236
He beat me in the LA to
Honolulu race 21 years ago.

102
00:07:51,304 --> 00:07:54,440
You had the better boat.
I was the better sailor.

103
00:07:54,507 --> 00:07:57,176
Wait till you see the boat
Elliott has now.

104
00:07:57,242 --> 00:07:59,745
-Oh.
-You have another boat now?

105
00:07:59,811 --> 00:08:01,813
Yeah, for now.

106
00:08:01,881 --> 00:08:05,183
Well, after you freshen up,
we'll have lunch and go for a
sail on the Cloud.

107
00:08:05,251 --> 00:08:07,986
Great, but I thought we were
going out to the reserve to
go over some things

108
00:08:08,053 --> 00:08:09,021
with Harry Jones.

109
00:08:09,088 --> 00:08:11,523
You're too thorough, Jonathan.

110
00:08:11,590 --> 00:08:15,027
Well, it's part of my nature.

111
00:08:15,093 --> 00:08:20,333
First things first.
I'll bet you a bottle of
'82 <i> Chateau Lafite</i>

112
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:24,002
that you can't beat that shot.

113
00:08:24,069 --> 00:08:25,570
You know, I'm not a
betting man.

114
00:08:25,637 --> 00:08:26,639
Oh, no.

115
00:08:30,675 --> 00:08:31,677
And yet?

116
00:08:36,381 --> 00:08:38,517
You'd better shoot straight,
Johnny.

117
00:08:47,793 --> 00:08:49,194
-JENNIFER: Bull's eye!
-LISA: Look at that!

118
00:08:49,261 --> 00:08:54,367
-JENNIFER: Yay! Oh, that's
great!
-I guess it's a tie.

119
00:08:54,433 --> 00:08:56,202
I hope you didn't do that
on purpose.

120
00:08:56,268 --> 00:08:58,870
I'm flattered that you think
I could.

121
00:08:58,937 --> 00:09:00,739
We can't just leave it a draw.

122
00:09:00,806 --> 00:09:02,475
-Come on, I'll show you
your room.
-Great.

123
00:09:09,915 --> 00:09:13,685
Cheer up, big boy.
The fun has just begun.

124
00:09:13,752 --> 00:09:16,921
The game is just in motion,
perfectly.

125
00:09:16,989 --> 00:09:20,392
They're here, and he's flush
with money.

126
00:09:20,458 --> 00:09:24,463
Luck, as they say, is the
residue of design.

127
00:09:25,798 --> 00:09:27,333
Jonathan!

128
00:09:39,078 --> 00:09:41,680
(LAUGHING)

129
00:09:50,455 --> 00:09:55,728
We look so young. That race
seems like a lifetime ago.

130
00:09:55,795 --> 00:09:57,930
To me, it's like it
was yesterday.

131
00:09:58,998 --> 00:10:02,568
I never saw a gun like this
this before.

132
00:10:02,634 --> 00:10:06,572
It's called a Desert Eagle.
It's the one I use when I need
all the help I can get.

133
00:10:07,472 --> 00:10:09,274
Careful, it's loaded.

134
00:10:09,341 --> 00:10:11,210
I treat every gun like
it's loaded.

135
00:10:13,512 --> 00:10:17,415
So, Elliott, are you going to
tell me that people are

136
00:10:17,482 --> 00:10:19,483
waiting in line to buy the
game reserve?

137
00:10:19,551 --> 00:10:21,853
Oh, Jonathan.
You know me better than that.

138
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:25,724
Why should I blow smoke?
Nobody's standing in line to
buy a game reserve.

139
00:10:25,791 --> 00:10:29,395
But, as a real estate
development, that's a
different story.

140
00:10:29,461 --> 00:10:35,100
So you're going to replace
the animals with overpriced
tract homes?

141
00:10:35,167 --> 00:10:39,505
-It's called progress.
-Not in my book, it's not.

142
00:10:39,572 --> 00:10:42,608
It'd take you a couple of
years to create a development
like that.

143
00:10:42,675 --> 00:10:44,442
You're not playing a game with
me, are you?

144
00:10:44,509 --> 00:10:49,715
The game reserve is not a
game. It's a very expensive
business proposition.

145
00:10:49,782 --> 00:10:51,917
I can't afford a couple
of years.

146
00:10:51,984 --> 00:10:56,555
My people have gone through
all the projections. You're
asking an awful lot for it.

147
00:10:56,621 --> 00:10:59,425
But maybe you think that
overcharging is a way
of winning.

148
00:10:59,491 --> 00:11:04,062
Let me tell you something,
Jonathan. I want a cashier's
check by tomorrow morning.

149
00:11:04,129 --> 00:11:10,135
No negotiation. That would
assure you that those
overpriced tract homes

150
00:11:10,202 --> 00:11:14,039
you're so worried about
wouldn't exist.

151
00:11:14,106 --> 00:11:18,978
Well, that wasn't part of the
deal, but you're famous for
changing the rules.

152
00:11:19,045 --> 00:11:22,747
I don't want to bore you, but
my life down here is not all

153
00:11:22,814 --> 00:11:24,849
"put another shrimp on
the barbie."

154
00:11:24,917 --> 00:11:28,453
And I don't want to bargain
with you, so why don't we just
cut through it all.

155
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:31,523
You know Jennifer's feeling
about animals.

156
00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:35,461
She's practically a one-woman
crusade. She'd have my head on
this wall, if she could.

157
00:11:36,829 --> 00:11:39,164
You'll have a cashier's check
in the morning.

158
00:11:39,231 --> 00:11:43,902
Well, that was quicker and
even more painless than even
I expected.

159
00:11:43,969 --> 00:11:48,807
I know how you like to win.
Maybe you think this will even
the score.

160
00:11:48,874 --> 00:11:53,412
You know, you can only make
just so many things in
life happen.

161
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:57,516
You can't make love happen.

162
00:11:58,684 --> 00:12:00,685
You either win or you lose,
and that's that.

163
00:12:04,056 --> 00:12:06,926
Congratulations, Jonathan.

164
00:12:11,463 --> 00:12:12,932
Should we join the others?

165
00:12:17,603 --> 00:12:21,006
Why doesn't Jonathan go out to
the reserve after I show you
the boat?

166
00:12:21,073 --> 00:12:23,141
It'll only take about an hour.

167
00:12:23,208 --> 00:12:26,678
And I'll drive you and Lisa
out to the reserve tomorrow
morning and we can stay

168
00:12:26,745 --> 00:12:28,913
the night so you really get a
feel for the place.

169
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:32,517
Oh, that's very kind, Elliott,
but I think I'd rather go
with Jonathan.

170
00:12:32,584 --> 00:12:36,488
Actually, that's not a bad
idea. I'm just going to be
going over the books tonight

171
00:12:36,555 --> 00:12:40,459
with Harry Jones. You can
come out tomorrow when all the
boring work is done.

172
00:12:40,525 --> 00:12:42,294
Come on, Jennifer, why not?

173
00:12:43,528 --> 00:12:47,065
-Are you sure?
-Positive, really.

174
00:12:47,132 --> 00:12:50,901
That's the ticket. Jonathan
will just check and recheck
all the numbers.

175
00:12:50,969 --> 00:12:54,873
You know how thorough he is.
Tonight you can get a rest,
get over your jet lag

176
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:56,876
so you can stay awake at
the opera.

177
00:12:58,644 --> 00:13:02,180
All right. But let's get going
bright and early in
the morning.

178
00:13:02,247 --> 00:13:06,218
Up with the birdies. But
tonight, there's a great place
out at the beach

179
00:13:06,284 --> 00:13:10,523
owned by a real character.
I'll book a table and we'll
make it an early evening.

180
00:13:15,327 --> 00:13:16,729
To togetherness.

181
00:13:17,563 --> 00:13:21,300
-Togetherness.
-Togetherness.

182
00:14:06,311 --> 00:14:11,016
Oh! Can I see your watch?
Don't you think you ought to
call Lisa's office

183
00:14:11,083 --> 00:14:12,651
and find out what's happened?

184
00:14:12,718 --> 00:14:15,687
Why? She's not coming.

185
00:14:15,754 --> 00:14:18,123
What do you mean?

186
00:14:18,189 --> 00:14:20,892
It's just you and me,
Jennifer.
Just like the old days.

187
00:14:22,294 --> 00:14:26,332
Wait a minute.
Did I miss something?

188
00:14:26,398 --> 00:14:27,999
Did you say something that I
didn't understand

189
00:14:28,066 --> 00:14:30,769
or did I say something you
didn't understand?

190
00:14:30,836 --> 00:14:36,374
No. If only you had. You know,
the times we had in London
are memories I can't shake.

191
00:14:36,441 --> 00:14:39,177
That was years ago!

192
00:14:39,244 --> 00:14:42,147
Yeah, well, I thought maybe
you still might change
your mind.

193
00:14:42,214 --> 00:14:47,819
Elliott, read my lips.
I'm married.

194
00:14:47,886 --> 00:14:49,954
And very happily.

195
00:14:50,021 --> 00:14:54,892
I've been married.
Several times.
Unhappily, unfortunately.

196
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:59,298
You know, the reason that I
called Jonathan first about
the game reserve is so

197
00:14:59,364 --> 00:15:04,736
that I might see you again.
I thought maybe we could pick
up where we left off.

198
00:15:04,803 --> 00:15:09,040
We left off, if that's the way
you want to put it

199
00:15:09,107 --> 00:15:12,778
easily six months before
I even met Jonathan.

200
00:15:13,878 --> 00:15:15,547
Well, he got lucky and
beat me.

201
00:15:15,613 --> 00:15:18,584
-It wasn't a competition.
-Well, it is now.

202
00:15:21,253 --> 00:15:26,858
Why don't we just finish our
drink and go?

203
00:15:26,925 --> 00:15:30,963
You're the only intoxicating
thing in this bar that I want.

204
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:36,635
Elliott! The only time you
ever hear something like that
is on a soap opera!

205
00:15:36,702 --> 00:15:40,606
-Jennifer, I don't watch TV.
-Good evening! Mr. Manning.

206
00:15:40,673 --> 00:15:48,046
Jennifer, may I present Bully.
The most raffish restaurateur
down under.

207
00:15:48,113 --> 00:15:53,218
It's an Australian name for,
how will I put it, a diamond
in the rough.

208
00:15:53,284 --> 00:15:55,854
But basically I'm just a
harmless beachcomber.

209
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:57,823
-How do you do?
-How do you do.

210
00:15:57,890 --> 00:16:00,391
I heard the you and Mr. Hart
were in town.

211
00:16:00,458 --> 00:16:03,127
-Ah.
-Yes, the Harts bought the
game reserve.

212
00:16:03,194 --> 00:16:08,766
I heard that, too, and I'm
very pleased for you both,
but mostly for the animals.

213
00:16:08,834 --> 00:16:11,002
So, where is your husband
this evening?

214
00:16:11,069 --> 00:16:13,472
Well, unfortunately, he's at
the reserve.

215
00:16:14,773 --> 00:16:16,842
And Miss Brandt?

216
00:16:16,908 --> 00:16:20,145
I think we need some dinner.
Is my table ready?

217
00:16:20,212 --> 00:16:22,881
Of course, Mr. Manning, I'll
get the <i> maitre d'.</i>
And may I suggest

218
00:16:22,947 --> 00:16:26,852
that the Tasmanian oysters are
particularly excellent
this evening.

219
00:16:30,722 --> 00:16:34,225
Elliott, I think I'd just like
to go home and go to bed.

220
00:16:34,292 --> 00:16:36,528
Oh, that's brilliant.
I'd like that, too.

221
00:16:36,595 --> 00:16:39,999
I mean I'm going to take
a taxi.

222
00:16:40,065 --> 00:16:46,571
Jennifer, you have changed.
When I first knew you, you
always liked a good time.

223
00:16:46,638 --> 00:16:49,507
You know, Elliott, I don't
think you ever knew me.

224
00:16:49,574 --> 00:16:52,377
-Jennifer.
-Elliott. Don't do that. Ah!

225
00:17:01,119 --> 00:17:03,322
Are you all right?

226
00:17:03,388 --> 00:17:08,860
I'm fine, thank you. Would you
do me a favor? Would you mind
calling a taxi for me?

227
00:17:08,926 --> 00:17:13,197
Mrs. Hart, please. Allow me to
take you home in my car.

228
00:17:13,265 --> 00:17:19,571
Thank you, Bully. You know,
sometimes a diamond in the
rough is a girl's best friend.

229
00:17:31,015 --> 00:17:35,587
There's such good news and
such bad news about this
place, Mr. Hart.

230
00:17:35,654 --> 00:17:41,092
We can't let this drop.
These animals need us.

231
00:17:41,159 --> 00:17:45,263
This is a great habitat.
The animals should be
breeding well.

232
00:17:45,330 --> 00:17:46,598
But they're not?

233
00:17:48,033 --> 00:17:51,669
I didn't want to tell you this
until I was absolutely sure.

234
00:17:51,737 --> 00:17:54,907
But all I think the Manning
reserves is the right to kill.

235
00:17:56,274 --> 00:17:57,976
I think he hunts them.

236
00:17:59,210 --> 00:18:00,412
Hunts them?

237
00:18:00,478 --> 00:18:02,514
Yes, Mr. Hart.

238
00:18:04,716 --> 00:18:06,918
Could you prove that?

239
00:18:06,985 --> 00:18:12,524
Look. Look at how the number
of each species diminishes
over that past five years.

240
00:18:14,793 --> 00:18:16,594
Let me see that.

241
00:18:16,661 --> 00:18:21,800
There's no record of sale,
there's no documentation as to
the causes of death

242
00:18:23,134 --> 00:18:24,703
they just disappear.

243
00:18:26,304 --> 00:18:27,773
(TELEPHONE RINGING)

244
00:18:30,442 --> 00:18:33,111
-Hello.<i>
 -Hello, this is Jennifer Hart.
 Is Jonathan there?</i>

245
00:18:33,177 --> 00:18:34,780
Oh, yes, Mrs. Hart.
He's right here.

246
00:18:36,848 --> 00:18:39,318
Hello, darling?
Everything okay?

247
00:18:39,384 --> 00:18:44,790
Now, darling, I don't want to
upset you, but Elliott's up to
his old tricks.

248
00:18:45,990 --> 00:18:47,292
What happened?

249
00:18:47,359 --> 00:18:50,462
Now, don't worry.
I'm fine now.

250
00:18:50,529 --> 00:18:53,231
Fine? Tell me what happened.

251
00:18:53,298 --> 00:18:57,035
Well, he got a little out
of line.
But everything's all right now

252
00:18:57,102 --> 00:18:59,370
and I'm here with Bully.
Bully's driving me home.

253
00:18:59,437 --> 00:19:03,341
-Bully?
-Bully. Of Bully's Bar, Bistro
and Bathhouse?

254
00:19:03,408 --> 00:19:04,743
Where in the world is that?

255
00:19:04,810 --> 00:19:06,812
Balmoral Beach.

256
00:19:06,879 --> 00:19:10,248
So Bully is driving you home
now because Elliott got out
of line?

257
00:19:11,183 --> 00:19:13,318
You better believe it.

258
00:19:13,384 --> 00:19:18,257
Okay. I'm on my way back there
now. And you tell Bully to
keep an eye on you.

259
00:19:21,459 --> 00:19:23,228
I'll do just that.

260
00:19:25,530 --> 00:19:31,103
I gotta get back to Manning's,
Harry. I'll call you tomorrow.

261
00:19:33,371 --> 00:19:37,342
Mrs. Hart? If you or Mr. Hart
ever need any assistance

262
00:19:37,408 --> 00:19:40,379
don't hesitate to give old
Bully a buzz.

263
00:19:55,027 --> 00:19:58,596
Jennifer, I can't tell you how
bad I feel about the way
things have turned out.

264
00:19:58,663 --> 00:20:01,265
Oh, now, Lisa.
It's not your fault.

265
00:20:01,332 --> 00:20:05,570
But if I hadn't gone out to
the office, maybe I wouldn't
have come back to such a mess.

266
00:20:05,636 --> 00:20:06,937
Don't blame yourself.

267
00:20:07,005 --> 00:20:10,375
He told me to get off the boat
and stay off.

268
00:20:11,443 --> 00:20:15,947
-He did?
-Yeah.

269
00:20:16,013 --> 00:20:21,119
What I really should do is
leave and never come back.
But I can't.

270
00:20:23,321 --> 00:20:26,257
You love him very much,
don't you?

271
00:20:26,324 --> 00:20:28,527
Against my better judgment,
trust me.

272
00:20:48,012 --> 00:20:50,915
-Darling?
-Hi, baby. Are you all right?

273
00:20:50,982 --> 00:20:53,117
-I'm fine.
-Where's Bully?

274
00:20:53,184 --> 00:20:57,122
Bully's back at
the bathhouse.
Believe me, he does exist.

275
00:20:57,189 --> 00:20:59,724
-And Elliott?
-He's on the Cloud.

276
00:20:59,791 --> 00:21:01,960
Don't go out there, darling.

277
00:21:02,026 --> 00:21:06,598
If he's going to play games,
he has to play by the rules.
He's broken the rules.

278
00:21:06,665 --> 00:21:11,235
I won't be long. And I want to
talk to him about how he runs
his game reserve.

279
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:37,896
Ah! I've been expecting you.
What would you like?

280
00:21:37,962 --> 00:21:39,831
I wouldn't mind
an explanation.

281
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:48,240
Well, call it desperation.
I don't have to tell you the
story of my life.

282
00:21:48,306 --> 00:21:51,643
Now, I know you've guessed
that my back is against
the wall.

283
00:21:53,145 --> 00:21:56,048
Foreclosures, overdrafts.

284
00:21:56,814 --> 00:21:57,949
Bankruptcy.

285
00:21:59,784 --> 00:22:03,521
So I'm not the only one who
suspected there was trouble
in paradise?

286
00:22:03,588 --> 00:22:09,961
I know. Word of mouth travels
like cholera. But you're the
only one who I'd admit it to.

287
00:22:11,696 --> 00:22:14,197
Why do I have the privilege?

288
00:22:14,265 --> 00:22:17,302
Because you are the only one
who'd believe that the only
thing I really wanted

289
00:22:17,369 --> 00:22:21,206
in my life, and lost,
is your wife.

290
00:22:24,943 --> 00:22:28,180
Now, that's the explanation
I was waiting for.

291
00:22:30,582 --> 00:22:33,051
I heard that you came on
strong with her tonight.

292
00:22:34,452 --> 00:22:38,090
I tried. And I lost.

293
00:22:40,492 --> 00:22:43,261
And I apologize.

294
00:22:44,996 --> 00:22:47,232
What if I don't want to accept
your apology?

295
00:22:48,332 --> 00:22:50,101
Well, then, I take it back.

296
00:22:50,167 --> 00:22:54,706
Do you know that when your
stress increases, your
intelligence decreases?

297
00:22:54,772 --> 00:22:58,176
Stress, I'm talking about
stress. Did you know that
people who are expert shots

298
00:22:58,243 --> 00:23:01,913
at target practice are often
lousy when the target
isn't inanimate,

299
00:23:01,979 --> 00:23:06,985
when the adrenaline starts to
pump. Anxiety and fear can
make you miss your mark.

300
00:23:11,022 --> 00:23:17,095
I'm not anxious, and I'm not
fearful. I'm angry.

301
00:23:18,863 --> 00:23:23,201
I'm angry about what you do
with those animals.

302
00:23:23,268 --> 00:23:27,238
Anger can make the adrenaline
pump, too.

303
00:23:27,305 --> 00:23:31,876
Our deal is off, so don't
count on that check too fast.

304
00:23:31,943 --> 00:23:36,548
And I want to look into some
things a bit further. You know
how thorough I am, Elliott.

305
00:23:39,984 --> 00:23:45,557
Jonathan! How much has
Jennifer told you about
her and me?

306
00:23:47,391 --> 00:23:49,694
Don't even go near
that, Elliott.

307
00:23:49,761 --> 00:23:52,497
No, no.
How much do you know about us?

308
00:23:52,563 --> 00:23:54,832
She never talked about you.

309
00:23:54,899 --> 00:23:58,768
Oh. Do you like to dance with
her? I always did.

310
00:23:58,836 --> 00:24:04,142
I always liked the way she
used to rub my back.
Does she rub your back?

311
00:24:06,044 --> 00:24:07,679
I mean, when you dance?

312
00:24:07,745 --> 00:24:13,851
Leave it alone.
She rubs my back just fine.

313
00:24:13,918 --> 00:24:17,688
And, on the best nights,
I remember how she used to
scratch my back.

314
00:24:32,537 --> 00:24:34,840
Do you want to take
another shot? Go ahead.

315
00:25:01,533 --> 00:25:03,301
Darling, are you hurt?

316
00:25:03,368 --> 00:25:05,203
That's Manning's blood.
Not mine.

317
00:25:05,270 --> 00:25:07,305
Elliott's hurt?

318
00:25:07,372 --> 00:25:09,807
Only his pride. If you want to
want to pick him up, I'm sure
you won't get any resistance.

319
00:25:09,874 --> 00:25:11,409
-Shall we get out of here?
-Yeah.

320
00:25:11,476 --> 00:25:13,044
-Can you get the briefcase?
-Yes.

321
00:25:13,111 --> 00:25:15,446
I don't think he wants to
see me.

322
00:25:15,513 --> 00:25:16,848
I'm sorry, Lisa.

323
00:25:46,677 --> 00:25:50,648
See, darling? The animals
officially belong to him.

324
00:25:50,715 --> 00:25:53,818
If he wants to hunt them all,
there's not a thing we can do
about it.

325
00:25:53,885 --> 00:25:57,855
-Is that his right to do that?
-Absolutely.

326
00:25:57,922 --> 00:26:03,428
That's outrageous!
That should be the biggest
crime in the world.

327
00:26:03,495 --> 00:26:07,231
Once the place belongs to us,
it'll be a different story.
But, in the meantime...

328
00:26:07,298 --> 00:26:12,070
In the meantime I think we
should call a TV station and
have them do an expose on him.

329
00:26:12,136 --> 00:26:13,838
-Good idea.
-(DOORBELL RINGING)

330
00:26:13,905 --> 00:26:15,040
(SIMULTANEOUSLY): Your turn.

331
00:26:15,807 --> 00:26:17,409
I think it is my turn.

332
00:26:20,645 --> 00:26:23,248
-Who is it?
-It's me, Lisa.

333
00:26:24,782 --> 00:26:27,318
-Lisa, come in.
-Good morning.

334
00:26:27,385 --> 00:26:30,321
You are just the person I want
to see.

335
00:26:30,388 --> 00:26:33,957
Are you aware of what Elliott
is doing with his animals?

336
00:26:34,024 --> 00:26:38,530
Jennifer, I'm not aware of
anything he does. In fact,
I don't even know where he is.

337
00:26:38,596 --> 00:26:42,266
He didn't come back to the
house last night and I'm
getting scared.

338
00:26:42,333 --> 00:26:44,535
-Good morning, Lisa.
-Good morning.

339
00:26:44,602 --> 00:26:46,504
What are you scared of?

340
00:26:46,570 --> 00:26:47,804
-Elliott didn't come back to
the house.
-(DOORBELL RINGING)

341
00:26:47,872 --> 00:26:49,007
Your turn!

342
00:26:51,709 --> 00:26:53,311
We're very popular
this morning.

343
00:26:55,713 --> 00:26:59,684
-Mr. Hart.
-Yes?

344
00:26:59,750 --> 00:27:04,121
Detective Sergeant McNeil,
Sydney police.

345
00:27:04,188 --> 00:27:07,725
You were with Elliott Manning
on board the Cloud last night?

346
00:27:07,791 --> 00:27:09,493
Yes, I was.

347
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:11,029
I'd like to ask you a
few questions.

348
00:27:12,796 --> 00:27:15,400
-Come in.
-Thank you.

349
00:27:15,466 --> 00:27:19,904
He's got one, too. There's
a few things I'd like to
tell you about the way

350
00:27:19,971 --> 00:27:23,174
Mr. Manning runs his reserve
and takes care of the animals.

351
00:27:25,042 --> 00:27:27,378
-My wife.
-Miss Brandt.

352
00:27:27,445 --> 00:27:30,781
I think I should tell you
first that Mr. Manning's dead.

353
00:27:30,848 --> 00:27:33,318
What? No.

354
00:27:33,384 --> 00:27:35,085
Darling.

355
00:27:35,152 --> 00:27:39,557
Blood was found on the deck of
the ketch and there was a
split railing.

356
00:27:39,623 --> 00:27:42,594
Looks like he was knocked
right through it.

357
00:27:45,229 --> 00:27:47,031
Was it Manning's blood?

358
00:27:47,097 --> 00:27:49,400
The lab's working on it.

359
00:27:49,467 --> 00:27:51,469
Can we have a look at your
hands, Mr. Hart?

360
00:27:52,903 --> 00:27:54,606
The bruised one, of course.

361
00:27:55,940 --> 00:27:57,509
How did you bruise that?

362
00:27:59,410 --> 00:28:05,483
We were on board the Cloud
last night. We were down in
the state room.

363
00:28:05,550 --> 00:28:09,120
Mr. Manning made an insulting
remark about my wife.
I hit him.

364
00:28:09,187 --> 00:28:10,788
But when I left he was very
much alive.

365
00:28:10,855 --> 00:28:14,993
As a matter of fact, he was
laughing at me through a
split lip.

366
00:28:15,059 --> 00:28:17,028
Yes, there was blood
below, too.

367
00:28:17,095 --> 00:28:20,732
We'd like to see what you were
wearing last night, Mr. Hart.

368
00:28:26,537 --> 00:28:29,274
How do you know that Elliott
is actually dead?

369
00:28:29,340 --> 00:28:31,109
We found what the sharks left
of him.

370
00:28:31,176 --> 00:28:34,946
And the shreds of his clothes
match what he was last
seen in.

371
00:28:35,013 --> 00:28:38,716
The Cloud was moored at the
jetty. Inside the shark nets.

372
00:28:38,783 --> 00:28:45,222
It was anchored beyond the
reef, in shark-infested
waters.

373
00:28:45,289 --> 00:28:49,126
And I'm telling you that's not
where she was when I went
aboard her.

374
00:28:49,193 --> 00:28:51,896
-Was anyone with you?
-No.

375
00:28:51,963 --> 00:28:54,565
Did anyone else board the
Cloud after you?

376
00:28:54,632 --> 00:28:59,103
I wouldn't know about that.
My wife and I came here to
the hotel right after that.

377
00:28:59,170 --> 00:29:03,508
Miss Brandt, you stayed at
home last night?

378
00:29:04,508 --> 00:29:06,344
That's right.

379
00:29:06,411 --> 00:29:12,649
Your room faces the water. Did
you see anyone, or hear any
small craft, motors?

380
00:29:12,716 --> 00:29:17,854
Well, I wasn't looking
outside, but even if I was

381
00:29:17,922 --> 00:29:20,625
I couldn't hear anything.
No motors.

382
00:29:23,394 --> 00:29:25,997
You slept soundly last night?

383
00:29:26,063 --> 00:29:30,568
I didn't sleep at all.
I waited for Elliott and he
never came back.

384
00:29:32,269 --> 00:29:33,571
JONATHAN: Detective.

385
00:29:35,606 --> 00:29:38,343
Maybe he fell overboard.

386
00:29:38,409 --> 00:29:41,812
Precisely, Mrs. Hart.

387
00:29:41,879 --> 00:29:47,685
You fall over a railing,
not through one.
Especially not one that thick.

388
00:29:47,751 --> 00:29:52,157
Mr. Hart, I must ask you to
surrender your passport.

389
00:29:56,560 --> 00:30:01,331
Oh, you can't be serious!
Are you charging my husband
with murder?

390
00:30:01,398 --> 00:30:05,869
Let's just say we'd like it if
he doesn't leave town.

391
00:30:05,936 --> 00:30:12,208
Believe me, Mr. Hart, the view
is a lot better from up here
than it is from jail.

392
00:30:12,276 --> 00:30:16,748
Miss Brandt, is there
somewhere that you and I can
go and talk privately?

393
00:30:18,048 --> 00:30:19,417
We can go to my office.

394
00:30:22,853 --> 00:30:24,022
Are you all right, Lisa?

395
00:30:27,725 --> 00:30:30,594
I'm sorry, Jonathan.
What I said is the truth.

396
00:30:37,868 --> 00:30:39,270
You'll be hearing from us.

397
00:30:41,639 --> 00:30:43,507
Take it down to the lab.

398
00:30:48,345 --> 00:30:53,918
This is insane! Maybe we ought
to call our lawyer.

399
00:30:53,985 --> 00:30:57,288
Maybe we ought to call
our banker and put a hold
on our check.

400
00:30:59,156 --> 00:31:06,197
Oh, darling. This trip hasn't
turned out the way we hoped,
has it?

401
00:31:06,264 --> 00:31:12,069
No. Well, let's look on the
bright side of things. We
still have our opera tickets.

402
00:31:12,136 --> 00:31:16,206
-Ah!
-(PHONE RINGING)

403
00:31:16,274 --> 00:31:20,477
I know that bad news travels
fast, but this is ridiculous.

404
00:31:24,215 --> 00:31:25,882
Hello.

405
00:31:25,950 --> 00:31:28,352
ELLIOTT: <i> Hello, Jonathan. Hey,
 how's the adrenaline pumping
 this morning?</i>

406
00:31:28,419 --> 00:31:29,854
It's him.

407
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:32,223
<i> I think that maybe you're in</i>
 <i> a lot of trouble.</i>

408
00:31:32,289 --> 00:31:35,860
Hello, Elliott.
You must be in a bit of
trouble yourself.

409
00:31:35,927 --> 00:31:39,129
Yeah, but I'm not going to
prison for the rest of
my life.

410
00:31:39,196 --> 00:31:42,132
I don't intend to, either.

411
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:45,136
Listen, that money should be
in the bank by now.

412
00:31:45,203 --> 00:31:48,105
I want that cash before I get
out of the country.

413
00:31:48,172 --> 00:31:50,241
I'm not giving you a cent.

414
00:31:50,307 --> 00:31:54,144
I can make this case stronger
against you. More clues that
you murdered me

415
00:31:54,211 --> 00:31:56,180
in jealous revenge.
But if I get my money...

416
00:31:56,247 --> 00:32:00,217
Oh, if you get your money
you'll probably send the
police a snapshot of yourself

417
00:32:00,284 --> 00:32:02,052
on the beach at Puerto Rico.

418
00:32:02,119 --> 00:32:07,692
Don't laugh. Good idea,
something like that would get
you off.

419
00:32:07,759 --> 00:32:13,498
Well, I can't wait to get your
offer. I'd swap passports with
you, but the police

420
00:32:13,564 --> 00:32:15,399
have already taken mine.

421
00:32:15,466 --> 00:32:19,937
You cash the check. I want big
denominations. You put the
money in a trash bag.

422
00:32:20,004 --> 00:32:24,007
Put the trash bag in a
receptacle bin next to the
concession stand

423
00:32:24,075 --> 00:32:27,245
on the ferry from Daws Point
to Luna Park.

424
00:32:28,145 --> 00:32:30,514
That might take a little time.

425
00:32:30,581 --> 00:32:34,985
Take a little time. You be on
the three o'clock ferry.
No cops, huh?

426
00:32:35,052 --> 00:32:37,388

 <i> past is going to turn up.</i>

Let's get this one together.

432
00:33:00,611 --> 00:33:04,982
Mr. Hart, Mrs. Hart. I finally
managed to get you a<i>
 New York Times.</i>

433
00:33:05,049 --> 00:33:07,819
You know, I practically had to
murder someone to get it?

434
00:33:12,056 --> 00:33:13,390
Something I said?

435
00:33:13,457 --> 00:33:18,229
No. It's just that now I'm
"Johnny on the Spot."

436
00:33:46,858 --> 00:33:50,194
-Is everything okay?
-Yeah.

437
00:33:51,595 --> 00:33:54,632
-Where's McNeil?
-Right in front of you.

438
00:33:54,699 --> 00:33:57,768
-What's McNeil doing now?
-He's been looking at a map.

439
00:33:57,835 --> 00:33:59,536
Any sign of Manning?

440
00:33:59,603 --> 00:34:04,108
No, but I did see a panhandler
who looked like he had a fake
beard on.

441
00:34:05,309 --> 00:34:06,610
There he goes!

442
00:34:32,069 --> 00:34:34,438
Do you think there are enough
of us?

443
00:34:34,505 --> 00:34:36,841
It's a regular rugby team.

444
00:35:21,886 --> 00:35:24,755
Oh, look.
It's the opera house.

445
00:35:26,323 --> 00:35:28,091
Isn't it beautiful?

446
00:35:28,158 --> 00:35:31,863
It looks great from here.
It's like we're in the
102nd balcony.

447
00:35:37,567 --> 00:35:41,939
I don't think anyone we're
interested in is going to go
anywhere near that trash bin

448
00:35:42,006 --> 00:35:43,808
until we put our trash in it.

449
00:35:43,874 --> 00:35:47,645
Why don't you go up there and
buy us a couple of cups
of coffee

450
00:35:47,711 --> 00:35:51,381
and I'll show the community
that we're not litterbugs.

451
00:35:51,448 --> 00:35:52,650
Good idea.

452
00:35:57,855 --> 00:35:59,257
Two coffees, please.

453
00:36:05,896 --> 00:36:07,431
Thank you.

454
00:36:10,634 --> 00:36:14,305
Here you go. That ought to
keep us awake for the opera.

455
00:36:15,772 --> 00:36:16,974
Anyone see us?

456
00:36:18,775 --> 00:36:20,545
Only the usual suspects.

457
00:36:33,223 --> 00:36:34,991
Look at that man.

458
00:36:35,059 --> 00:36:37,061
He's about Elliott's size,
isn't he?

459
00:36:38,496 --> 00:36:40,731
Does he look like the guy you
saw at the bank?

460
00:36:40,798 --> 00:36:42,799
No, absolutely not.

461
00:36:42,866 --> 00:36:45,068
-You sure?
-Positive.

462
00:36:45,135 --> 00:36:46,537
Well, he's got a beard.

463
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:52,542
Why don't you go over there
and pull it, and see if
it's fake.

464
00:36:52,609 --> 00:36:54,345
Why don't you?

465
00:36:55,746 --> 00:36:57,215
Let's see what he does, first.

466
00:37:18,969 --> 00:37:21,472
Hey! What's going on?

467
00:37:22,873 --> 00:37:25,776
-It's not fake.
-Who are you guys?

468
00:37:25,843 --> 00:37:28,745
-Sydney Police.
-Oh, police.

469
00:37:28,812 --> 00:37:31,382
Hey!
I think this might be a bomb!

470
00:37:31,449 --> 00:37:32,516
What?

(SCREAMING)

472
00:37:37,120 --> 00:37:41,259
Perfectly safe, no danger
whatsoever. Get lost, mate.

473
00:37:54,772 --> 00:37:59,009
Well, you've certainly caused
enough trouble in your short
stay here in Australia.

474
00:37:59,076 --> 00:38:01,746
Is this some sort of game
you're playing, or what?

475
00:38:01,812 --> 00:38:05,015
I'm not playing any game.
I think it's Mr. Manning
that's playing the game.

476
00:38:05,082 --> 00:38:08,118
I didn't know he wasn't going
to show up or send anybody.

477
00:38:08,185 --> 00:38:11,822
Mr. Hart, I have only your
word that he called.

478
00:38:11,889 --> 00:38:13,757
You have mine, too.

479
00:38:13,824 --> 00:38:19,797
Well, I only have your
husband's word that he punched
Manning on board the Cloud.

480
00:38:19,864 --> 00:38:22,799
Mr. Hart, you're not only a
suspect, you're the
only suspect.

481
00:38:22,866 --> 00:38:24,768
Really?

482
00:38:24,834 --> 00:38:31,174
Well, what about his man
Tonga? Or his first mate, or
his fourth mate, Miss Brandt?

483
00:38:31,241 --> 00:38:33,244
We've checked.

484
00:38:33,311 --> 00:38:36,714
Well, I think if you check on
Mr. Manning's business
dealings, his holdings,

485
00:38:36,781 --> 00:38:39,149
his investments, you might
find that he...

486
00:38:39,215 --> 00:38:42,519
That Manning's empire was
about to collapse?

487
00:38:42,585 --> 00:38:45,890
We've had our suspicions about
his business dealings for some
time now.

488
00:38:46,823 --> 00:38:49,026
What have you got?

489
00:38:49,093 --> 00:38:54,131
Oh, Mr. Hart, I'm just a local
bloke. The Australian federal
police have had a

490
00:38:54,198 --> 00:38:57,000
team on this for over a year,
but they don't tell
us anything.

491
00:38:57,067 --> 00:39:00,571
Oh, come on now, Detective
Sergeant McNeil. You must
have had your unofficial ear

492
00:39:00,637 --> 00:39:01,639
to the ground.

493
00:39:02,373 --> 00:39:05,009
Well, I suppose.

494
00:39:05,075 --> 00:39:08,912
Well, among other things, he
has gambled his employees'

495
00:39:08,979 --> 00:39:11,848
pension plan and lost.

496
00:39:11,916 --> 00:39:14,117
Oh! Well!

497
00:39:14,184 --> 00:39:17,554
Doesn't that mean that there
are other people who would
like to see him dead?

498
00:39:17,621 --> 00:39:20,724
That someone might want to
get him for what he's done to
his animals.

499
00:39:20,790 --> 00:39:25,195
Look, Mr. and Mrs. Hart.
I think you've been reading
far too many detective novels.

500
00:39:25,262 --> 00:39:29,066
I suggest you leave this to
the authorities to handle
this case.

501
00:39:30,934 --> 00:39:32,702
Have any more questions?

502
00:39:32,769 --> 00:39:37,307
Yes, I do. You only picked up
a cashier's check from
the bank.

503
00:39:37,374 --> 00:39:39,142
What's in the package?

504
00:39:39,209 --> 00:39:41,678
I shredded <i> The Thin Man.</i>

505
00:39:44,481 --> 00:39:48,052
Excuse me for a moment.

506
00:39:52,456 --> 00:39:54,758
Want to keep a lookout?

507
00:39:54,824 --> 00:39:56,160
-Keep a lookout!
-Yeah.

508
00:39:56,226 --> 00:39:59,796
We're in a goldfish bowl!
Everyone can see us!

509
00:39:59,863 --> 00:40:04,667
Well, if McNeil gets in your
eye line, send up a
flare, huh?

510
00:40:17,981 --> 00:40:19,617
What are you doing?

511
00:40:24,188 --> 00:40:26,557
Darling, what are you doing?

512
00:40:26,623 --> 00:40:29,860
I'm doing what Claudette
Colbert did in <i> It Happened
 One Night.</i>

513
00:40:45,542 --> 00:40:48,979
You're attracting attention,
not distracting.

514
00:40:49,045 --> 00:40:52,583
Yes, but they're not looking
at you, are they?

515
00:40:55,119 --> 00:40:56,120
Right.

516
00:41:02,425 --> 00:41:07,030
Harvey J. Lee,
7 Napier Street.

517
00:41:07,097 --> 00:41:09,266
Did you find what you were
looking for?

518
00:41:09,333 --> 00:41:11,168
Yeah, I got it.

519
00:41:13,270 --> 00:41:15,706
You can come down now,
Claudette.

520
00:41:15,772 --> 00:41:18,040
Here he comes.

521
00:41:18,108 --> 00:41:20,844
Mrs. Hart, what are you doing?

522
00:41:20,911 --> 00:41:23,580
Just killing flies.

523
00:41:23,647 --> 00:41:26,683
My wife was killing flies and
I was killing time.

524
00:41:26,750 --> 00:41:31,855
Is there some sort of crime in
that, or do I have to call my
attorney again?

525
00:41:31,922 --> 00:41:38,929
The results from the lab
report. It was Manning's blood
on the deck of the Cloud

526
00:41:38,996 --> 00:41:41,198
and on your shirt, Mr. Hart.

527
00:41:41,265 --> 00:41:47,304
Well, he deliberately smeared
it on me. What about the body
parts that you recovered?

528
00:41:47,370 --> 00:41:49,306
Did you test those, too?

529
00:41:49,373 --> 00:41:52,476
No, we haven't. It's not
necessary. The evidence takes
you where it tells you to go.

530
00:41:52,543 --> 00:41:54,078
Where did it tell you to go?

531
00:41:54,144 --> 00:41:57,413
But, if you had tested them

532
00:41:57,480 --> 00:42:01,051
you might discover that those
were not the remains of
Elliott Manning.

533
00:42:01,118 --> 00:42:05,022
Mr. Manning's remains were
identified by his body guard
from an old scar.

534
00:42:05,089 --> 00:42:06,490
He's being buried
this afternoon.

535
00:42:07,791 --> 00:42:10,994
This afternoon? That's a
little fast, isn't it?

536
00:42:11,061 --> 00:42:13,597
That's how his lawyer said
it had to be done.

537
00:42:13,663 --> 00:42:15,732
Well, you'd better stop it.

538
00:42:15,799 --> 00:42:18,535
Forgive me for saying so,
Mr. Hart, but so should you.

539
00:42:18,602 --> 00:42:22,071
Now, if you're
finished protesting,
and swatting flies...

540
00:42:22,139 --> 00:42:24,741
I want you to dig up those
body parts and have
them tested.

541
00:42:24,808 --> 00:42:29,046
I am not going to exhume a
body or parts of a body on
your word.

542
00:42:29,113 --> 00:42:31,615
First of all, I would have to
have a court order.

543
00:42:31,682 --> 00:42:33,549
Then get it.

544
00:42:33,617 --> 00:42:35,753
And what? Tell the magistrate
that, on the word of the
murder suspect

545
00:42:35,819 --> 00:42:37,687
who made a fool of me on
the ferry...

546
00:42:37,754 --> 00:42:40,524
I want you to dig up those
body parts, and I want you
to have them tested.

547
00:42:40,591 --> 00:42:45,328
Mr. Hart. Enough tests have
been run and the results
are conclusive.

548
00:42:49,065 --> 00:42:53,637
Now, in half an hour, one of
Australia's most prominent

549
00:42:53,703 --> 00:42:58,642
citizens is being laid
to rest. G'day.

550
00:42:59,243 --> 00:43:00,344
G'day.

551
00:43:10,787 --> 00:43:13,189
-JONATHAN: What an afternoon.
-Yes.

552
00:43:13,256 --> 00:43:18,928
A ferry ride, a fight with
the police, a funeral,
what next?

553
00:43:20,030 --> 00:43:21,765
An Aboriginal hoedown?

554
00:43:21,832 --> 00:43:23,866
-That might be fun.
-Ah.

555
00:43:25,201 --> 00:43:26,203
Father?

556
00:43:27,237 --> 00:43:28,706
The Lord is my shepherd...

557
00:43:28,772 --> 00:43:32,276
-Hello, Mrs. Hart.
-Hello, Bully.

558
00:43:34,144 --> 00:43:37,080
He maketh me to lie down in
green pastures...

559
00:43:37,147 --> 00:43:40,783
Such a sad and
unexpected occasion.

560
00:43:40,850 --> 00:43:44,386
Yes, and so fast.

561
00:43:44,454 --> 00:43:47,458
Oh.
This is my husband, Jonathan.

562
00:43:47,524 --> 00:43:49,526
Darling, this is Bully, of
Bully's Bar, Bistro...

563
00:43:49,593 --> 00:43:51,328
-And Bathhouse.
-That's right.

564
00:43:51,394 --> 00:43:53,129
-How do you do?
-How do you do?

565
00:43:53,196 --> 00:43:56,665
-You have a charming wife.
-Thank you.

566
00:43:56,733 --> 00:43:59,369
And thank you for taking care
of her last night.

567
00:43:59,436 --> 00:44:01,638
But what happened to you?

568
00:44:01,705 --> 00:44:05,743
Well, I was checking out the
waterfront, which is what we
beachcombers are apt to do.

569
00:44:08,812 --> 00:44:10,981
PRIEST: My cup runneth over.

570
00:44:12,849 --> 00:44:15,386
Tonga looks quite upset.

571
00:44:18,422 --> 00:44:21,158
He looks like he wants to
kill me.

572
00:44:21,225 --> 00:44:25,295
And I will dwell in the house
of the Lord forever.

573
00:44:25,362 --> 00:44:28,965
It's hard to believe that,
just a few hours ago, you were
wrestling with

574
00:44:29,032 --> 00:44:31,334
Mr. Elliott Manning at the
bar of my restaurant.

575
00:44:31,401 --> 00:44:35,606
Yes, it's almost as if he's
still with us.

576
00:44:48,985 --> 00:44:53,057
Poor Lisa.
If only she knew the truth.

577
00:45:02,332 --> 00:45:05,535
Jennifer. Jonathan, thank
you for being here.

578
00:45:05,602 --> 00:45:07,703
Hmm!

579
00:45:07,771 --> 00:45:13,510
Tonga. Tonga's just been
great. He claimed the body or
whatever and

580
00:45:13,577 --> 00:45:15,312
made all the
burial arrangements.

581
00:45:16,680 --> 00:45:19,917
Well, Tonga seems like a very
obliging fellow.

582
00:45:22,118 --> 00:45:26,288
Oh, Jonathan. Perhaps you were
wondering why Detective
Sergeant McNeil

583
00:45:26,356 --> 00:45:27,991
wanted to see me alone.

584
00:45:28,057 --> 00:45:30,493
Well, I assumed that he wanted
to ask you some
personal questions.

585
00:45:30,560 --> 00:45:33,596
Right. He thought I might be
a suspect, too.

586
00:45:35,632 --> 00:45:39,870
Believe me. No matter what
anybody else says, I don't
think you're guilty of murder.

587
00:45:45,041 --> 00:45:50,047
If I'd been on that boat last
night, Mr. Hart, you'd be in
that coffin, not him.

588
00:45:50,547 --> 00:45:51,548
Tonga.

589
00:46:01,158 --> 00:46:05,629
You and I know who is not
in the casket.

590
00:46:05,695 --> 00:46:09,032
The question is, who is?

591
00:46:18,442 --> 00:46:20,811
You know what the meaning
of the word, "kangaroo," is?

592
00:46:20,877 --> 00:46:22,212
What is it?

593
00:46:22,279 --> 00:46:24,581
-That's right!
-What's right?

594
00:46:24,648 --> 00:46:26,583
-"What is it?"
-What is what?

595
00:46:26,650 --> 00:46:29,819
The meaning of the word,
"kangaroo." Unless it's
apocryphal.

596
00:46:29,886 --> 00:46:32,922
-What is?
-"What is it?"

597
00:46:32,989 --> 00:46:36,226
-Wait a minute,
who's on first?
-What?

598
00:46:36,292 --> 00:46:38,362
No, What's on second.

599
00:46:38,428 --> 00:46:40,797
-What are you talking about?
-It's the old Abbott and
Costello routine, you know,

600
00:46:40,864 --> 00:46:44,667
-Who's on first, What's on
second, I don't know his...
-Oh yeah.

601
00:46:44,734 --> 00:46:46,903
Well, it's sort of like that.

602
00:46:46,970 --> 00:46:50,506
What did the colonial say to
the Aborigine when he first
saw a kangaroo?

603
00:46:50,574 --> 00:46:52,676
-What'd he say?
-"What is it?"

604
00:46:52,743 --> 00:46:54,278
Hm, and what did the
aborigine say?

605
00:46:54,344 --> 00:46:56,613
Well, he couldn't say
anything. He didn't understand
the man.

606
00:46:56,679 --> 00:46:59,382
So he asked a translator what
the white man had said.

607
00:46:59,449 --> 00:47:03,286
And the translator said,
"kangaroo," which in
aboriginal means,

608
00:47:03,353 --> 00:47:04,921
BOTH: "what is it."
(LAUGHING)

609
00:47:04,988 --> 00:47:06,388
(PHONE RINGING)

610
00:47:06,456 --> 00:47:08,491
-You answer it.
-No, no,
you answer it.

611
00:47:08,558 --> 00:47:10,427
Nah, you answer it.

612
00:47:10,493 --> 00:47:11,962
He's gonna want to talk
to you.

613
00:47:12,029 --> 00:47:15,032
-How do you know it's him?
-I know. I know.

614
00:47:18,701 --> 00:47:21,638
-Hello?
-ELLIOTT: <i> You used to be
 better than that, Jonathan.</i>

615
00:47:22,572 --> 00:47:24,641
You were right.

616
00:47:24,707 --> 00:47:26,977
<i> I thought you were always</i>
 <i> so thorough.</i>

617
00:47:27,043 --> 00:47:29,646
It was obvious that the ferry
was crawling with cops.

618
00:47:29,713 --> 00:47:34,651
<i> -I want my money.</i>
-Sounds like your adrenaline
is pumping a bit now.

619
00:47:34,718 --> 00:47:38,687
You're not gonna get a cent.
And you're gonna go to
prison. And Manning,

620
00:47:38,755 --> 00:47:43,861
no matter what anyone else
believes, I know you're alive,
and I'm gonna get you.

621
00:47:47,564 --> 00:47:48,565
Ready?

622
00:47:50,767 --> 00:47:53,236
Well done.

623
00:47:53,303 --> 00:47:55,705
They're no good to us.
Hart's not gonna give us
the money.

624
00:47:56,806 --> 00:47:58,841
The game's not over yet.

625
00:47:58,908 --> 00:48:01,411
I want you to check the hotel
safe and their suite.

626
00:48:01,477 --> 00:48:03,379
Harry Jones said they're going
to the opera tonight.

627
00:48:03,446 --> 00:48:06,649
-Yeah, yeah I gotcha.
-Oh, and while you're at it, I
want you to do something

628
00:48:06,716 --> 00:48:08,451
about that cop who's been
following me.

629
00:48:08,518 --> 00:48:10,653
Yeah, get him off your back.

630
00:48:10,720 --> 00:48:14,258
ELLIOTT: But the last thing I
do, I gotta get Jonathan Hart
out of my life.

631
00:48:22,799 --> 00:48:26,103
-Good evening.
-Good evening. Thank you.

632
00:48:28,005 --> 00:48:30,574
Would you like your car in
the VIP valet lot, sir?

633
00:48:30,640 --> 00:48:34,844
-Uh, no, it's rented.
-The tux?

634
00:48:34,911 --> 00:48:38,548
No, the car.
Just put it in the lot with
the peasant shacks.

635
00:48:38,615 --> 00:48:40,250
-Certainly.
-Thank you.

636
00:48:41,951 --> 00:48:45,422
I can't believe we're actually
here. (LAUGHING)

637
00:48:45,489 --> 00:48:47,691
JONATHAN: It doesn't look as
good as it did from the ferry.

638
00:48:47,758 --> 00:48:52,160
JENNIFER: Oh, come on.
You're gonna love every minute

-To find Harvey J. Lee of the

our of Wagner.

00:49:32,169 --> 00:49:35,739
There was a rover following
us, I saw them in the

I think it was Tonga, that's
why we're gonna give him the
slip.

in at weddings

Oh, you're saying that because
we are in our band clothes?

I guess he dresses for gigs.

me he was a musician.

come home at all hours or

maybe Harvey's been

cleaners brings back the same
tux every two days.

But someone who knows
that the key is under the
flowerpot

712
00:55:28,257 --> 00:55:31,360
delivers another one
each time.

713
00:55:31,427 --> 00:55:34,163
Because no tux ever actually
leaves this place in the first
place.

from his car after he left the

01:03:55,064 --> 01:03:58,901
Good, thank you.
Now that I've got the check,

803
01:03:58,968 --> 01:04:01,403
and I've got you...

804
01:04:01,470 --> 01:04:04,774
Jonathan, you're a money
conscious man,

805
01:04:04,840 --> 01:04:09,145
think of how much you're gonna
save on your burial costs,
huh?

806
01:04:40,776 --> 01:04:42,178
He's gone.

807
01:04:45,180 --> 01:04:47,450
BULLY: Hot time in the old
town tonight.

808
01:04:49,551 --> 01:04:52,054
(GROANING)
Thank you, Bully.

809
01:04:52,120 --> 01:04:55,324
You should have been here
earlier. We could've used you
instead of the backhoe.

810
01:04:55,391 --> 01:04:59,094
My car is just over here.
It wouldn't hurt to hurry.

811
01:04:59,161 --> 01:05:02,231
A bit late in the evening for
explanations, don't you think?

812
01:05:02,298 --> 01:05:05,033
I'll flip you to see who takes
it back to the rental company.

813
01:05:07,669 --> 01:05:10,506
-How was your shower?
-Oh, it was great, thank you.

814
01:05:10,572 --> 01:05:13,743
-I made you some breakfast,
please sit down.
-Oh, it looks delicious.

815
01:05:15,544 --> 01:05:20,015
-Thank you.
-Mr. Hart, so you're happy
to be in one piece?

816
01:05:20,082 --> 01:05:23,819
-Very happy.
-Unlike some other people
we could mention.

817
01:05:23,886 --> 01:05:27,089
You're referring to
Mr. Manning's crewman who
went overboard?

818
01:05:27,156 --> 01:05:29,258
How did you know about that?

819
01:05:29,325 --> 01:05:32,194
Well I got to the cemetery in
time to here Mr. Manning tell
you what happened.

820
01:05:35,263 --> 01:05:38,165
-You saw Manning?
-For a moment.

821
01:05:38,233 --> 01:05:43,205
Fortunately, I was behind
the mausoleum when your rental
car blew up.

822
01:05:43,272 --> 01:05:48,310
And Mr. Manning, well, he
got away under a rather large
cloud of black smoke.

823
01:05:48,377 --> 01:05:50,312
Not unlike a magician.

824
01:05:50,379 --> 01:05:54,083
Yes, he's full of tricks.

825
01:05:54,150 --> 01:05:56,151
-Cappuccino?
-Please.

826
01:05:56,218 --> 01:05:59,422
Have a croissant while they're
hot.

827
01:05:59,488 --> 01:06:03,158
Bully, how did you happen
to be in the cemetery in the
middle of the night?

828
01:06:03,225 --> 01:06:07,462
Well, I was following Tonga,
and Tonga was following you.

829
01:06:07,529 --> 01:06:09,999
He thought you gave him the
slip at the opera.

830
01:06:10,065 --> 01:06:13,268
He must've planted the bomb
beneath your car and then
disappeared on his own.

831
01:06:13,335 --> 01:06:18,907
-And you?
-Well, I followed you to the
house of one Harvey J. Lee.

832
01:06:18,974 --> 01:06:21,677
Lee is an agent for the AFP.

833
01:06:21,743 --> 01:06:23,845
He's been investigating
Manning.

834
01:06:23,912 --> 01:06:28,350
He has an empty apartment with
only tuxedos and an answering
machine in it.

835
01:06:28,416 --> 01:06:30,485
He pretends he plays
in a band

836
01:06:30,552 --> 01:06:32,388
for weddings and Bar Mitzvahs.

837
01:06:32,454 --> 01:06:36,292
We think he was the one who
went through the rail on
Manning's boat

838
01:06:36,358 --> 01:06:39,996
and was buried in his place.
This is delicious!

839
01:06:41,697 --> 01:06:43,966
Well, it's all in the way you
steam the milk.

840
01:06:45,333 --> 01:06:48,504
Really? The milk.

841
01:06:52,608 --> 01:06:54,643
What's your interest in all
of this?

842
01:06:54,709 --> 01:06:57,446
Well, Mr. Manning owes me
a great deal of money.

843
01:06:57,513 --> 01:07:01,217
Gambling debts.
And since he's alive and out
there,

844
01:07:01,283 --> 01:07:03,919
I want it back,
simple as that.

845
01:07:03,986 --> 01:07:06,721
You better tell the police
you saw him too.

846
01:07:06,789 --> 01:07:10,259
-They won't believe me.
-Well, I don't think that
going to the police is going

847
01:07:10,325 --> 01:07:11,725
to get the money for me.

848
01:07:11,793 --> 01:07:14,029
Besides,
look what it did for you.

849
01:07:14,096 --> 01:07:16,398
What do you suggest?

850
01:07:16,465 --> 01:07:19,134
Well, I need your help
to get Elliott Manning.

851
01:07:19,201 --> 01:07:22,170
You're the only ones that he's
shown himself to.

852
01:07:22,237 --> 01:07:24,807
He needed our money to
skip the country.

853
01:07:24,873 --> 01:07:27,376
I gave him the cashier's check
at the cemetery.

854
01:07:27,442 --> 01:07:29,678
There's no telling where he
is.

855
01:07:29,745 --> 01:07:32,481
-I don't think so.
-Really?

856
01:07:34,183 --> 01:07:40,922
-Why?
-Because I have what's left
of your check.

857
01:07:40,989 --> 01:07:45,661
The blast from the explosion
must have knocked it out of
his hands.

858
01:07:49,798 --> 01:07:54,970
-Then, he still needs our
money.
-Besides, for whatever reason,

859
01:07:55,037 --> 01:08:01,042
Mr. Manning has a special
animosity and fascination
for you.

860
01:08:01,109 --> 01:08:05,481
Oh, he'll come after you.
But this time,
not just for the money,

861
01:08:06,214 --> 01:08:09,285
but to kill you.
Mango?

862
01:08:12,221 --> 01:08:16,191
21 years ago, I beat him in a
race from Los Angeles to
Hawaii.

863
01:08:16,258 --> 01:08:20,461
And he has a certain obsession
with my wife.

864
01:08:20,529 --> 01:08:23,966
He thinks she should have
married him instead of me.

865
01:08:24,033 --> 01:08:28,637
Aside from the race,
there was never any contest.

866
01:08:28,703 --> 01:08:31,073
So you have a long history
of competitiveness?

867
01:08:31,139 --> 01:08:33,074
In sports and business
affairs.

868
01:08:33,140 --> 01:08:36,210
And in affairs of the heart,
so to speak.

869
01:08:36,278 --> 01:08:41,016
No, it goes way beyond that.
It's a power play with him,
a game

870
01:08:41,082 --> 01:08:43,986
in which so far,
he hasn't scored any points.

871
01:08:44,720 --> 01:08:47,756
But he's determined to.

872
01:08:47,823 --> 01:08:52,127
Finish up your breakfasts.
I'm sure that the police will
be eager to speak to you.

873
01:08:52,194 --> 01:08:55,097
I'm sure they've traced
the car to us, and they've got
our prints all over the

874
01:08:55,163 --> 01:08:56,799
backhoe and the tools.

875
01:08:56,866 --> 01:09:00,801
Mr. Hart, we may be able to
help each other.

876
01:09:00,868 --> 01:09:03,639
You need him to clear
your name, and

877
01:09:03,706 --> 01:09:06,841
I need him to cleat the slate.
I need you.

878
01:09:06,908 --> 01:09:11,113
And vice-versa.
So why don't we join forces?

879
01:09:13,549 --> 01:09:15,718
-Darling?
-Sounds good to me.

880
01:09:17,452 --> 01:09:19,855
Well, Bully, it looks like
we're in this thing together.

881
01:09:21,089 --> 01:09:22,758
(LAUGHING)

882
01:09:23,925 --> 01:09:27,096
It's gonna be a bright
and sunny day.

883
01:09:27,162 --> 01:09:31,866
And you're gonna need some
sunglasses. I'll get you some
from the souvenir shop.

884
01:09:31,933 --> 01:09:35,804
You think the cappuccinos
are good, you're gonna love
these.

885
01:09:35,871 --> 01:09:36,872
Ah.

886
01:09:42,377 --> 01:09:45,347
You were right.
McNeil must be inside
looking for us.

887
01:09:45,412 --> 01:09:47,182
Here's my card with a number
to call

888
01:09:47,249 --> 01:09:50,085
if you ever need my help, hm?

889
01:09:50,152 --> 01:09:52,488
Alright, partner,
we'll keep in touch.

890
01:09:54,423 --> 01:09:57,559
-Bye.
-Put on your glasses.

891
01:09:57,626 --> 01:10:00,896
-Maybe no one will recognize
us.
-Oh, good idea.

892
01:10:13,408 --> 01:10:15,177
Mr. and Mrs. Hart?

893
01:10:22,751 --> 01:10:24,853
You've let it go too far with
him.

894
01:10:24,920 --> 01:10:28,390
I never meant to, Bully,
honestly.

895
01:10:28,457 --> 01:10:32,494
I thought you were smarter
than that. You knew what kind
of man Manning was.

896
01:10:32,561 --> 01:10:36,130
What did you think?
That you were going to be the
one to change him?

897
01:10:36,197 --> 01:10:42,104
-I guess that must be it.
-Lisa, I just don't want to
see you get hurt.

898
01:10:42,170 --> 01:10:46,809
I know. You're a good friend,
and I appreciate your concern
for me.

899
01:10:48,610 --> 01:10:51,813
Then you've got some
tough decisions to make.

900
01:10:51,880 --> 01:10:55,117
-You've got some serious
thinking to do.
-I know I do.

901
01:10:56,151 --> 01:10:57,519
I know it better than anyone.

902
01:11:07,029 --> 01:11:12,133
Thanks for your passport,
Mrs. Hart, and for your
cooperation.

903
01:11:12,200 --> 01:11:15,170
Now, if you don't mind,
I'd like to have a word with
your husband.

904
01:11:16,738 --> 01:11:18,207
See you back at the hotel?

905
01:11:20,209 --> 01:11:21,677
I won't be long, darling.

906
01:11:25,481 --> 01:11:26,715
Take a seat.

907
01:11:36,691 --> 01:11:37,693
(DOORBELL RINGING)

908
01:11:39,294 --> 01:11:41,496
-Lisa!
-Please, may I come in?

909
01:11:41,563 --> 01:11:43,398
Certainly.

910
01:11:43,465 --> 01:11:47,602
-Look, I don't know how to
say this. So I'll just say it.
-What?

911
01:11:47,669 --> 01:11:50,906
-Elliott is alive.
-Did you hear from him?

912
01:11:50,973 --> 01:11:52,908
He called me at the house
just before I left.

913
01:11:52,974 --> 01:11:56,077
-He wants me to get him
out of the country.
-Oh, this is great.

914
01:11:56,144 --> 01:11:58,546
-I guess I should have known
better.
-Jonathan is with the police

915
01:11:58,613 --> 01:12:00,448
right now, you can call them.

916
01:12:00,515 --> 01:12:03,751
-I can't call the police.
-Of course you can.

917
01:12:03,818 --> 01:12:07,122
Jennifer, I don't know if I
can deliberately betray him.

918
01:12:07,188 --> 01:12:10,826
You're not betraying him,
you're telling the truth.

919
01:12:10,893 --> 01:12:16,097
Lisa, Jonathan is accused of
murdering a man we both know
is very much alive.

920
01:12:16,164 --> 01:12:20,201
I know. Part of me thinks I
have to turn him in, but the
other part thinks...

921
01:12:20,269 --> 01:12:25,373
Here is Detective Sergeant
McNeil's card.
That is his direct line.

922
01:12:25,440 --> 01:12:29,678
-Here's the telephone.
Call him, please.
-Okay.

923
01:12:34,049 --> 01:12:35,984
(RINGING)

924
01:12:36,050 --> 01:12:38,987
Detective Sergeant McNeil?
This is Lisa Brandt.

925
01:12:39,054 --> 01:12:42,391
I've heard from Elliott
Manning.
Yes, he's alive.

926
01:12:44,325 --> 01:12:47,495
Detective, at this point,
why should I lie?

927
01:12:47,562 --> 01:12:50,366
He wants me to meet him
at Whale Beach in, uh,

928
01:12:51,299 --> 01:12:52,568
45 minutes?

929
01:12:54,336 --> 01:12:59,241
Yes. Okay.
I keep him there until you
and your men arrive.

930
01:13:01,343 --> 01:13:02,644
Yes, bye.

931
01:13:04,046 --> 01:13:05,981
Lisa, you're great.

932
01:13:08,583 --> 01:13:13,087
It worked. She pulled it off
because she's not a loose
cannon like you are.

933
01:13:13,154 --> 01:13:15,690
You know if the Hart's had
been in that car, I'd have
been just as finished

934
01:13:15,757 --> 01:13:17,424
as they'd be.

935
01:13:17,492 --> 01:13:20,295
Thanks to Lisa,
there's one more round.

936
01:13:20,361 --> 01:13:24,132
Did you deliver the gift to
Jonathan, or did you screw
that up too?

937
01:13:24,198 --> 01:13:26,935
(CHUCKLING)

938
01:13:27,002 --> 01:13:28,137
Hm.

939
01:13:44,185 --> 01:13:47,255
-Keep down, Jennifer.
-Did you see Elliott?

940
01:13:47,322 --> 01:13:50,926
No, not yet. But we don't want
him to see you before the
police get here.

941
01:13:50,993 --> 01:13:55,330
Right. I'll just stay here,
and I'll look out for
Detective Sergeant McNeil.

942
01:13:55,397 --> 01:13:57,599
Right.

943
01:13:57,665 --> 01:14:03,304
-Wish us luck.
-Lisa, thank you. I couldn't
have done this without you.

944
01:14:03,371 --> 01:14:04,540
It's alright.

945
01:15:34,362 --> 01:15:36,130
(RINGING)

946
01:15:36,197 --> 01:15:41,336
Hello, this is Jennifer Hart,
has Detective Sergeant McNeil
left yet?

947
01:15:41,403 --> 01:15:44,172
Have I left for where,
Mrs. Hart?

948
01:15:44,239 --> 01:15:48,543
-Detective Sergeant McNeil!
-At this point, I think we
know each other well enough

949
01:15:48,609 --> 01:15:49,978
for you to call me Fred.

950
01:15:50,045 --> 01:15:54,850
Fine. Fred, did you receive
a phone call from Lisa Brandt

951
01:15:54,917 --> 01:15:57,920
saying that Elliott Manning
had phoned her to say that...

952
01:15:59,387 --> 01:16:01,889
That's too confusing,
Jennifer.

953
01:16:01,957 --> 01:16:04,960
Why didn't you just stay in
the car, like you were
supposed to?

954
01:16:09,664 --> 01:16:12,666
I'm sorry Jennifer.
Really, I am.

955
01:16:12,734 --> 01:16:15,404
She was talking to the cops,
let's get out of here.

956
01:16:20,775 --> 01:16:23,144
-Hello, Johnny.
-Mr. Hart.

957
01:16:24,913 --> 01:16:27,715
-What happened to you
-I wouldn't go in there
if I was you.

958
01:16:27,782 --> 01:16:29,851
Oh now, Mrs. Hart couldn't
be in that bad of a mood.

959
01:16:29,917 --> 01:16:33,521
No, Mrs. Hart left with
Miss Brandt a little while
before it came.
