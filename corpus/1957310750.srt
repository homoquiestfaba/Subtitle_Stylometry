Tonight in London,

00:00:28,602 --> 00:00:30,393
we have the night of nights.

Damn, there is so much talent
in this city.

The Triple-A rated
Bodyguard of the Year Awards.

7
00:00:35,774 --> 00:00:37,202
Now, these awards are given out

8
00:00:37,237 --> 00:00:39,875

MIKE: Oh, my God.

13
00:00:49,315 --> 00:00:50,523
I mean, there is only one

14
00:00:50,558 --> 00:00:52,085
white-hot favourite here, Steve.

15
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:54,527
And this bodyguard
has had a tremendous year.

16
00:00:54,562 --> 00:00:56,221
His track record is untouchable.

17
00:00:56,256 --> 00:01:00,698
He has had the best client list,
the best evasive car manoeuvres,

18
00:01:00,733 --> 00:01:02,766
the best gun-handling skills.

19
00:01:02,801 --> 00:01:04,262
Christ, he even has
the best hair.

20
00:01:04,297 --> 00:01:07,606
And he actually insists
his clients wear seatbelts.

21
00:01:07,641 --> 00:01:09,476
That's how safe this guy is.

22
00:01:09,511 --> 00:01:11,841
He's the bodyguard that needs
no introduction.

23
00:01:11,876 --> 00:01:14,778
Michael Bryce is
the clear favourite this year.

MICHAEL: God, no!

71

He's a hit man wanted for, like,

72
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:35,083
a zillion murders
around the world.

73
00:03:35,118 --> 00:03:37,085
Which is why,
when I protected him

74
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:39,087
on a dangerous trip
across Europe

75
00:03:39,122 --> 00:03:41,760
so he could give evidence
at a war crimes trial -

76
00:03:41,795 --> 00:03:44,554
even took a bullet for him,
I might add -

77
00:03:44,589 --> 00:03:46,358
the Bodyguarding Committee,
they wouldn't...

78
00:03:46,393 --> 00:03:47,766
..they wouldn't recognise it.

79
00:03:47,801 --> 00:03:50,230
Apparently they don't take
kindly to protecting sociopaths.

80
00:03:50,265 --> 00:03:53,068
So in two weeks, I have to go
in front of a tribunal

81
00:03:53,103 --> 00:03:55,367
and try to get my
Triple-A rated licence back.

83
00:03:56,876 --> 00:03:59,272
we sometimes have to
deal with the past.

84
00:03:59,307 --> 00:04:02,308
Now, is there anything
you want to talk about

85
00:04:02,343 --> 00:04:03,881
from your childhood, perhaps?

86
00:04:03,916 --> 00:04:06,378
And my childhood would be
relevant how?

87
00:04:06,413 --> 00:04:07,918
Well, quite often
validation issues

88
00:04:07,953 --> 00:04:09,579
stem from a disapproving father.

89
00:04:09,614 --> 00:04:12,417
I don't have validation issues.

90
00:04:12,452 --> 00:04:14,089
I have a licensing issue.

91
00:04:14,124 --> 00:04:16,289
I am a bodyguard
without a licence.

92
00:04:16,324 --> 00:04:20,799
That's like being a...
a belly dancer without a torso.

93
00:04:21,802 --> 00:04:23,967
What are you thinking about
right now, Michael?

94
00:04:24,970 --> 00:04:26,629
I'm thinking about
the fact that you're seated

95
00:04:26,664 --> 00:04:28,136
six feet away from
an exposed window with

96
00:04:28,171 --> 00:04:30,534
multiple sniper nest positions
on the building opposite,

97
00:04:30,569 --> 00:04:32,338
most likely on the eighth floor.

98
00:04:32,373 --> 00:04:34,780
The additional height
gives the marksman an advantage.

99
00:04:34,815 --> 00:04:35,979
I'm thinking about

100
00:04:36,014 --> 00:04:37,849
the closest available weapon
to me right now -

101
00:04:37,884 --> 00:04:39,884
the letter opener/
stabbing instrument

102
00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:42,282
on the desk to my right.

103
00:04:42,317 --> 00:04:43,723
What are you thinking about?

104
00:04:44,517 --> 00:04:47,650
I'm thinking you need to forget
bodyguarding for a while

105
00:04:47,685 --> 00:04:49,421
and find happiness within.

106
00:04:49,456 --> 00:04:50,554
Within what?

107
00:04:50,589 --> 00:04:51,863
Within yourself!

108
00:04:51,898 --> 00:04:54,767
Happiness in who you are.

109
00:04:56,397 --> 00:04:57,462
I'm listening.

110
00:04:57,497 --> 00:04:58,837
Well, first things first -

111
00:04:58,872 --> 00:05:01,466
I think all the guns
and violence are...

112
00:05:01,501 --> 00:05:03,006
..weighing on your soul.

113
00:05:03,041 --> 00:05:05,844
So you need to get away
and clear your mind

114
00:05:05,879 --> 00:05:09,309
and then you can find
your future self.

115
00:05:10,345 --> 00:05:12,246
Wait, wait, like...

116
00:05:12,281 --> 00:05:14,083

No, not Tuscany. No Tuscany.

00:05:30,695 --> 00:05:33,201
OK. Uh, Capri then?

125
00:05:33,236 --> 00:05:34,400
Capri?

126
00:05:34,435 --> 00:05:36,908
Like the pants?

127
00:05:38,241 --> 00:05:39,977
Also, a lot clients
find it helpful

128
00:05:40,012 --> 00:05:42,705
writing journal letters
to their future self.

129
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:45,081

the data junction at Viarregio.

in the centre of Viarregio.

What assets do we have
on the ground in that region?

1933

is Bobby O'Neill.

Don't talk to us like that,
