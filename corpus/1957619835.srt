1
00:01:36,379 --> 00:01:37,758
Cut it out, Nicky.

2
00:01:37,793 --> 00:01:40,275
My name's Nicole, Birdbrain.

3
00:01:40,310 --> 00:01:45,344
My name's Ian, Nicky so Icky.

4
00:01:45,379 --> 00:01:48,620
Hey, do that again and your
name's going to be Deceased.

5
00:01:48,655 --> 00:01:51,482
I'm so scared.

6
00:01:51,517 --> 00:01:53,862
You're so weird.

7
00:01:53,896 --> 00:01:57,586
Hey, Birdbrain, why do you have
all this stuff anyway?

8
00:01:57,620 --> 00:02:00,793
I got to have something to do
out in the sticks.

9
00:02:00,827 --> 00:02:02,275
Grandma has a radio.

10
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:03,896
She has all this other stuff
too.

11
00:02:03,931 --> 00:02:06,275
Besides, I'm sure you'll hang
out great with the cows.

12
00:02:06,310 --> 00:02:07,586
You smell the same, anyways.

13
00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:10,827
Ha, ha, ha.

14
00:02:10,862 --> 00:02:12,862
This is so unfair.

15
00:02:12,896 --> 00:02:14,931
I'm getting shipped out
to Grandma's, and you get to

16
00:02:14,965 --> 00:02:16,586
stay here all summer,
hanging out with your

17
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:17,517
smelly friends.

18
00:02:17,551 --> 00:02:19,103
I am not hanging out.

19
00:02:19,137 --> 00:02:20,448
I have a job now.

20
00:02:20,482 --> 00:02:22,793
I'm a productive member
of society.

21
00:02:22,827 --> 00:02:24,620
I have responsibilities.

22
00:02:24,655 --> 00:02:25,517
But hey, we better get going.

23
00:02:25,551 --> 00:02:27,586
Your bus leaves at 12:25.

24
00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:28,413
Okay.

25
00:02:28,448 --> 00:02:30,413
Hey.

26
00:02:30,448 --> 00:02:31,689
I'm going to be busy too.

27
00:02:31,724 --> 00:02:33,655
I'm not going to be around here
much.

28
00:02:33,689 --> 00:02:35,482
Mom and Dad deserve
this vacation.

29
00:02:35,517 --> 00:02:38,448
It'll be like
a second honeymoon for them.

30
00:02:38,482 --> 00:02:46,241
They don't want us
in Hawaii with them.

31
00:02:46,275 --> 00:02:48,310
At least I can take
my man, Bentley.

32
00:02:48,344 --> 00:02:51,379
That dog of yours
is really a freak.

33
00:02:51,413 --> 00:02:57,103
No freakier
than your boyfriend.

34
00:02:57,137 --> 00:03:00,103
Not in my car.

35
00:03:00,137 --> 00:03:01,827
Come on.

36
00:03:02,206 --> 00:03:12,241
How you doing?

37
00:03:12,275 --> 00:03:22,310
How you doing?

38
00:03:22,310 --> 00:03:32,241
How you doing?

39
00:03:32,275 --> 00:03:42,310
How you doing?

40
00:03:42,310 --> 00:03:52,241
How you doing?

41
00:03:52,275 --> 00:04:02,758
How you doing?

42
00:04:14,172 --> 00:04:17,206
Ah. Very nice.

43
00:04:17,241 --> 00:04:17,931
Great.

44
00:04:17,965 --> 00:04:21,241
Hey, watch the curb here there.

45
00:04:21,275 --> 00:04:22,413
I'm only going to be a...

46
00:04:22,448 --> 00:04:23,379
few minutes, babe, all right.

47
00:04:23,413 --> 00:04:25,241
So I want you to keep it
up front, all right.

48
00:04:25,275 --> 00:04:27,620
Just keep it up front.

49
00:04:36,413 --> 00:04:37,965
Come in.

50
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,827
I'm already in.

51
00:04:39,862 --> 00:04:42,620
Your wit astounds me but
with your problems I wouldn't

52
00:04:42,655 --> 00:04:44,034
be in a joking mood, Jimmy.

53
00:04:44,068 --> 00:04:44,931
What can I say?

54
00:04:44,965 --> 00:04:46,931
Your sunshiny-like face
makes me giggle

55
00:04:46,965 --> 00:04:47,965
like a school girl.

56
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,241
So what do you think
about it?

57
00:04:50,275 --> 00:04:52,241
Well, I--geez, I don't know.

58
00:04:52,275 --> 00:04:54,344
I can't believe how broke I am.

59
00:04:54,379 --> 00:04:56,862
Yes, you're absolutely
busted.

60
00:04:56,896 --> 00:04:58,379
All the money your daddy
gave you is gone.

61
00:04:58,413 --> 00:04:59,586
Your trust fund is empty.

62
00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:00,620
Wow.

63
00:05:00,655 --> 00:05:03,448
Empty like that adorable
little face of yours.

64
00:05:03,482 --> 00:05:05,206
You know,
I got to tell you something.

65
00:05:05,241 --> 00:05:06,793
I know that you're enjoying
this, okay?

66
00:05:06,827 --> 00:05:08,310
Because you helped me
spend my money.

67
00:05:08,344 --> 00:05:09,448
Lawyer's fees aren't cheap.

68
00:05:09,482 --> 00:05:10,517
Hey, look, I got to tell you.

69
00:05:10,551 --> 00:05:12,034
As a lawyer, you know,
your prices are reasonable,

70
00:05:12,068 --> 00:05:15,275
but as my girlfriend, uh--
And worth it.

71
00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:15,827
I have a plan.

72
00:05:15,862 --> 00:05:16,827
Well, let's hear it.

73
00:05:16,862 --> 00:05:18,482
You have your uncle's house
in Wisconsin.

74
00:05:18,517 --> 00:05:19,827
What, the chauffeur, he died?

75
00:05:19,862 --> 00:05:20,896
No.

76
00:05:20,931 --> 00:05:22,275
Camille, come on,
we've been through this like

77
00:05:22,310 --> 00:05:23,448
a thousand times, all right?

78
00:05:23,482 --> 00:05:25,724
My uncle's will states that
we can't touch the place

79
00:05:25,758 --> 00:05:26,827
until the chauffeur dies.

80
00:05:26,862 --> 00:05:28,137
No.

81
00:05:28,172 --> 00:05:30,689
Offing Mr. Lyle is not
the plan, Jimmy.

82
00:05:30,724 --> 00:05:31,206
Why not?

83
00:05:31,241 --> 00:05:31,862
Come on.

84
00:05:31,896 --> 00:05:32,793
The guy's old.

85
00:05:32,827 --> 00:05:35,206
He could have a--
Jimmy.

86
00:05:35,241 --> 00:05:36,344
Listen.

87
00:05:36,724 --> 00:05:45,517
Yes, the will gave Mr. Lyle

88
00:05:47,931 --> 00:05:52,586
the house as long as he's alive,
if he pays the property taxes,

89
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:54,965
and lucky for you, the little
pension your uncle gave him

90
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,103
isn't enough.

91
00:05:56,137 --> 00:05:56,965
So it's ours.

92
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,310
Not quite.

93
00:05:58,344 --> 00:06:00,758
I've requested a local judge
to, uh, permit sale

94
00:06:00,793 --> 00:06:01,931
of the property.

95
00:06:01,965 --> 00:06:04,310
It will go up for auction
and you could stand to make

96
00:06:04,344 --> 00:06:06,965
quite a chunk of change.

97
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,103
After my fee, that is.

98
00:06:08,137 --> 00:06:09,241
Naturally.

99
00:06:09,275 --> 00:06:11,172
And then I'll be broke again.

100
00:06:11,206 --> 00:06:12,379
Don't worry.

101
00:06:12,413 --> 00:06:15,068
I have a feeling there's more
than a house to cash in on.

102
00:06:15,103 --> 00:06:18,068
Oh, see, I like it
when you say cash.

103
00:06:18,103 --> 00:06:22,724
Pay attention, or you won't
be getting any more cash.

104
00:06:22,758 --> 00:06:24,896
I gather you've heard
rumors about the money

105
00:06:24,931 --> 00:06:26,482
your uncle may have hidden away?

106
00:06:26,517 --> 00:06:29,103
Uh, yeah, but I--I thought
it was all baloney.

107
00:06:29,137 --> 00:06:32,379
No, I have a hunch it's more
than just lunch meat, my dear,

108
00:06:32,413 --> 00:06:34,517
but if it does exists,
then the chauffeur never

109
00:06:34,551 --> 00:06:35,793
found it, or else
he would have--

110
00:06:35,827 --> 00:06:37,241
He would have paid the taxes.

111
00:06:37,275 --> 00:06:38,689
Ooh, look at that.

112
00:06:38,724 --> 00:06:41,896
You've been thinking again.

113
00:06:41,931 --> 00:06:43,931
Now it seems a shame
to turn the property over

114
00:06:43,965 --> 00:06:46,724
to strangers with a treasure
buried in the backyard.

115
00:06:46,758 --> 00:06:48,034
You know where it's buried?

116
00:06:48,068 --> 00:06:48,758
What do I look like?

117
00:06:48,793 --> 00:06:51,620
A gypsy fortune teller?

118
00:06:51,655 --> 00:06:53,206
You're gonna have to dig for it.

119
00:06:53,241 --> 00:06:54,000
Go alone.

120
00:06:54,034 --> 00:06:57,551
Try to blend in.

121
00:06:57,586 --> 00:07:00,206
If you can blend in.

122
00:07:00,241 --> 00:07:04,448
Oh, and Jimmy, if you get
in trouble, I don't know you.

123
00:07:04,482 --> 00:07:05,448
What are you talking about?

124
00:07:05,482 --> 00:07:06,724
Discretion's my middle name.

125
00:07:06,758 --> 00:07:07,655
Yeah.

126
00:07:07,689 --> 00:07:09,413
Oh, have that moved.

127
00:07:09,448 --> 00:07:13,137
Ugh.

128
00:07:13,172 --> 00:07:17,137
No!

129
00:07:17,172 --> 00:07:18,241
Ow!

130
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:21,000
Jimmy!

131
00:07:23,379 --> 00:07:33,379
No way was I going to

132
00:07:33,413 --> 00:07:43,448
No way was I going to

133
00:07:43,448 --> 00:07:53,379
No way was I going to

134
00:07:53,413 --> 00:08:03,517
No way was I going to

135
00:08:03,517 --> 00:08:11,379
No way was I going to

136
00:08:22,137 --> 00:08:25,482
let you ride in the luggage
compartment, my man.

137
00:08:25,517 --> 00:08:33,655
Hey, city slicker.

138
00:08:42,068 --> 00:08:44,241
Are you smelling those cows?

139
00:08:44,275 --> 00:08:45,620
Yes, I do.

140
00:08:45,655 --> 00:08:47,862
Well, get over here.

141
00:08:47,896 --> 00:08:52,241
Get over here and give
your grandma a kiss.

142
00:08:52,275 --> 00:08:53,103
Come on.

143
00:08:53,137 --> 00:08:55,689
As soon as I
get everything in here.

144
00:08:55,724 --> 00:08:58,000
That'll be the day.

145
00:08:58,034 --> 00:09:01,413
Think we can get
all that stuff in here?

146
00:09:01,448 --> 00:09:02,379
If we're lucky.

147
00:09:02,448 --> 00:09:06,103
Maybe I should have brought
a horse trailer.

148
00:09:06,137 --> 00:09:07,379
What do you think?

149
00:09:07,413 --> 00:09:08,413
Yes, I do.

150
00:09:08,448 --> 00:09:09,724
And there's that shaggy dog.

151
00:09:09,758 --> 00:09:10,896
Is he coming?

152
00:09:10,931 --> 00:09:12,793
Yes, he is.

153
00:09:12,827 --> 00:09:15,206
Eh, come on, boy.

154
00:09:15,241 --> 00:09:17,137
Come on, shaggy dog.

155
00:09:17,172 --> 00:09:18,068
Come on.

156
00:09:18,103 --> 00:09:19,758
Over here, boy.

157
00:09:19,793 --> 00:09:23,068
Well, give your old grandma
a kiss.

158
00:09:23,103 --> 00:09:23,931
Come on.

159
00:09:23,965 --> 00:09:25,896
Ooh, what do I feel there?

160
00:09:25,931 --> 00:09:27,068
Whiskers?

161
00:09:27,103 --> 00:09:29,137
You better stop your growing up.

162
00:09:29,172 --> 00:09:32,413
I'm feeling ancient.

163
00:09:32,448 --> 00:09:34,241
Let me look at you.

164
00:09:34,275 --> 00:09:37,931
Oh, my boy, you better
watch it.

165
00:09:37,965 --> 00:09:42,689
You're going to turn into
a very handsome guy.

166
00:09:42,724 --> 00:09:45,241
Oh, I'm sorry, kiddo.

167
00:09:45,275 --> 00:09:48,551
Listen, are you hungry?

168
00:09:48,586 --> 00:09:50,241
Is it dinner time?

169
00:09:50,275 --> 00:09:52,275
Uh...

170
00:09:52,310 --> 00:09:53,931
Oh.

171
00:09:53,965 --> 00:09:56,793
Would you like a malted milk?

172
00:09:56,827 --> 00:09:59,310
Well, we don't have any
of those Haagen Daagen shops

173
00:09:59,344 --> 00:10:03,310
here but would
a Dairy Queen do?

174
00:10:03,344 --> 00:10:05,517
Okay, here we go.

175
00:10:05,965 --> 00:10:15,965
Come on, come on.

176
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:26,034
Come on, come on.

177
00:10:26,034 --> 00:10:34,931
Come on, come on.

178
00:10:38,137 --> 00:10:50,241
Ooh.

179
00:10:54,586 --> 00:10:55,965
Whoa!

180
00:10:56,413 --> 00:10:59,000
Gosh darn city slickers!

181
00:11:02,172 --> 00:11:12,172
Oh, there.

182
00:11:12,206 --> 00:11:25,517
Oh, there.

183
00:11:28,655 --> 00:11:29,862
Ah ha.

184
00:11:29,896 --> 00:11:35,206
I am so happy you are going to
spend a whole summer with me.

185
00:11:35,241 --> 00:11:37,620
In a couple of weeks
we're going to have our big

186
00:11:37,655 --> 00:11:40,275
Fourth of July celebration.

187
00:11:40,310 --> 00:11:44,620
Oh, you can enter
the hula hoop marathon.

188
00:11:44,655 --> 00:11:46,586
Oh, it's going to be such fun.

189
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:48,310
You do pretty good, I'm sure.

190
00:11:48,344 --> 00:11:50,172
That's my boy.

191
00:11:50,206 --> 00:11:53,000
Give me a hug.

192
00:11:53,034 --> 00:11:59,482
I was beginning to think you'd
gotten too old to have fun.

193
00:11:59,517 --> 00:12:00,689
Okay?

194
00:12:00,724 --> 00:12:03,241
Right.

195
00:12:03,275 --> 00:12:04,379
Come on.

196
00:12:04,413 --> 00:12:06,344
Come on, Bentley boy.

197
00:12:06,379 --> 00:12:08,758
All right.

198
00:12:18,034 --> 00:12:19,689
Look what you did.

199
00:12:19,724 --> 00:12:21,827
I'm sorry.

200
00:12:21,862 --> 00:12:22,655
Oh my gosh.

201
00:12:22,689 --> 00:12:24,068
I'm sorry, Mrs. Applegate.

202
00:12:24,103 --> 00:12:26,034
Hello, Miss Davies.

203
00:12:26,068 --> 00:12:27,034
Oops.

204
00:12:27,068 --> 00:12:28,517
I'm sorry.

205
00:12:28,551 --> 00:12:31,724
Uh, bad throw, huh?

206
00:12:31,758 --> 00:12:33,931
The rambler's looking spiff,
Ms. Applegate.

207
00:12:33,965 --> 00:12:35,413
Oh, thank you very much.

208
00:12:35,448 --> 00:12:37,103
Here's your Frisbee.

209
00:12:37,137 --> 00:12:38,551
I got to go.

210
00:12:38,586 --> 00:12:39,586
I'll see you.

211
00:12:39,620 --> 00:12:40,862
Mm, bye.

212
00:12:40,896 --> 00:12:43,448
Oh, darn, I wanted to introduce
you to her, but I couldn't

213
00:12:43,482 --> 00:12:47,448
remember the recall device
I use to remember her name.

214
00:12:47,482 --> 00:12:50,310
She's the Davies girl,
and they moved here

215
00:12:50,344 --> 00:12:53,413
about two years ago,
and they live at three doors

216
00:12:53,448 --> 00:12:56,448
down from me.

217
00:12:56,482 --> 00:13:00,241
Father is a dentist, I think.

218
00:13:00,275 --> 00:13:02,103
Or is it a plumber...hmm.

219
00:13:02,137 --> 00:13:05,793
I don't know, but throwing
a Frisbee on a bike is stupid.

220
00:13:05,827 --> 00:13:08,310
Do you like playing with
those flying saucers?

221
00:13:08,344 --> 00:13:10,482
I learned from the old hippy
himself.

222
00:13:10,517 --> 00:13:12,103
Your dad loved those things.

223
00:13:12,137 --> 00:13:14,655
He would always leave his
homework, but he'd never forget

224
00:13:14,689 --> 00:13:16,275
his brisbee.

225
00:13:16,310 --> 00:13:17,862
Frisbee.

226
00:13:17,896 --> 00:13:19,655
Frisbee, bisbee, Frisbee.

227
00:13:19,689 --> 00:13:21,413
Man, whatever.

228
00:13:21,448 --> 00:13:22,758
How are they anyway?

229
00:13:22,793 --> 00:13:23,655
Who, my parents?

230
00:13:23,689 --> 00:13:24,448
Yeah.

231
00:13:24,482 --> 00:13:26,000
They're on their way
to Hawaii.

232
00:13:26,034 --> 00:13:29,931
We're going to Hawaii
next year, you and me.

233
00:13:29,965 --> 00:13:32,586
Ooh, that sound.

234
00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:33,448
Sorry.

235
00:13:33,482 --> 00:13:37,103
Oh, no, it just makes me
melancholy.

236
00:13:37,137 --> 00:13:39,965
Listen, let's forget
about dinner, huh?

237
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,137
Let's go have another malt.

238
00:13:43,172 --> 00:13:45,758
Oh, I wish I could remember
that girl's name.

239
00:13:45,793 --> 00:13:53,275
Come on, boy.

240
00:13:53,310 --> 00:13:59,413
I do like that dog,
but I don't know about that toy.

241
00:13:59,448 --> 00:14:01,068
Let's go.

242
00:14:01,448 --> 00:14:08,379
Oh.

243
00:14:13,413 --> 00:14:15,000
Oops.

244
00:14:15,413 --> 00:14:22,034
Juliette.

245
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,344
What?

246
00:14:25,379 --> 00:14:28,344
But soft, what light
through yonder window breaks?

247
00:14:28,379 --> 00:14:30,551
It is the east,
but Juliette is the sun.

248
00:14:30,586 --> 00:14:31,586
Shakespeare.

249
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:33,724
That was my memory trick.

250
00:14:33,758 --> 00:14:36,241
She's up at the crack of dawn
every morning with

251
00:14:36,275 --> 00:14:37,482
her paper route.

252
00:14:37,517 --> 00:14:39,551
Juliette Davies.

253
00:14:39,586 --> 00:14:41,862
She can work on her aim.

254
00:14:41,896 --> 00:14:44,758
Well, she usually hits
what she's aiming for.

255
00:14:44,793 --> 00:14:47,034
She's on the baseball team.

256
00:14:47,068 --> 00:14:48,068
Softball?

257
00:14:48,103 --> 00:14:51,000
No, no, she plays
with the boys.

258
00:14:51,034 --> 00:14:55,172
Yeah, got a blistering fastball.

259
00:14:55,206 --> 00:14:56,103
Demoralizes her.

260
00:14:56,137 --> 00:14:57,620
Come on.

261
00:14:57,655 --> 00:15:01,413
Minute, just a minute.

262
00:15:01,448 --> 00:15:02,586
Here you go, Grandma.

263
00:15:02,620 --> 00:15:03,862
Thank you, open the door.

264
00:15:03,896 --> 00:15:07,068
Okay.

265
00:15:07,103 --> 00:15:21,206
Oh, fleas, we better give him
a flea bath.

266
00:15:21,241 --> 00:15:21,896
Yeah, come on. Come on.

267
00:15:21,931 --> 00:15:22,896
Let's do it. Let's do it.

268
00:15:22,931 --> 00:15:24,172
You can do it.

269
00:15:24,206 --> 00:15:25,275
All right.

270
00:15:25,310 --> 00:15:26,896
Come on, one more,
one more, one more.

271
00:15:26,931 --> 00:15:29,275
Let's do it.

272
00:15:29,310 --> 00:15:31,724
Strike two.

273
00:15:42,344 --> 00:15:43,103
Come on, come on.

274
00:15:43,137 --> 00:15:44,275
Right here.

275
00:15:44,310 --> 00:15:45,413
Yeah, let's do it, let's do it.

276
00:15:45,448 --> 00:15:49,310
Yeah, go, go, go.

277
00:15:49,344 --> 00:15:51,724
Strike three, you're out.

278
00:16:00,241 --> 00:16:01,310
Come on.

279
00:16:01,344 --> 00:16:03,379
Watch the ball, watch the ball.

280
00:16:03,413 --> 00:16:05,379
Come on, Ricky.

281
00:16:05,413 --> 00:16:07,827
Come on, Ricky, come on.

282
00:16:48,551 --> 00:16:49,517
Thanks.

283
00:16:49,551 --> 00:16:50,965
You want some cereal?

284
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,172
Got some fresh berries.

285
00:16:53,206 --> 00:16:56,827
Sure.

286
00:16:56,862 --> 00:16:57,896
Ooh.

287
00:16:58,275 --> 00:17:00,103
Ow.

288
00:17:02,241 --> 00:17:09,620
Hi.

289
00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:18,896
Practicing for the Fourth
of July?

290
00:17:18,931 --> 00:17:20,275
Wasn't expecting you.

291
00:17:20,310 --> 00:17:22,758
I wasn't beaned
by a flying object.

292
00:17:22,793 --> 00:17:24,448
Sorry about that.

293
00:17:24,482 --> 00:17:27,517
They only seem to get away
from me when you're around.

294
00:17:27,551 --> 00:17:30,965
May I?

295
00:17:33,241 --> 00:17:42,068
It's all in the hips, see?

296
00:17:43,724 --> 00:17:46,206
Like this.

297
00:17:46,241 --> 00:17:49,241
Nah.

298
00:17:49,275 --> 00:17:50,586
I'm not that interested.

299
00:17:50,620 --> 00:17:53,206
You're not having much fun
here, are you?

300
00:17:53,241 --> 00:17:54,241
It's all right.

301
00:17:54,275 --> 00:17:55,413
Yeah, sure.

302
00:17:55,448 --> 00:17:56,206
Well, look.

303
00:17:56,241 --> 00:17:57,896
My name is Jules.

304
00:17:57,931 --> 00:17:59,793
Ian.

305
00:17:59,827 --> 00:18:03,275
Nice dog.

306
00:18:03,310 --> 00:18:04,689
Nasty toy.

307
00:18:04,724 --> 00:18:05,931
His name is Bentley.

308
00:18:05,965 --> 00:18:07,103
The dog, that is.

309
00:18:07,137 --> 00:18:08,172
Not the toy.

310
00:18:08,206 --> 00:18:11,068
Anyways, I need a substitute
for my paper route.

311
00:18:11,103 --> 00:18:13,103
My family's going camping
this weekend.

312
00:18:13,137 --> 00:18:15,620
My regular sub's
at a big swim meet.

313
00:18:15,655 --> 00:18:16,758
Sure.

314
00:18:16,793 --> 00:18:17,275
You will?

315
00:18:17,310 --> 00:18:18,586
Sure.

316
00:18:18,620 --> 00:18:20,000
Just like that?

317
00:18:20,034 --> 00:18:21,862
I need you Saturday and Sunday.

318
00:18:21,896 --> 00:18:24,448
Meet me in front of my house,
the brick one at 6:15,

319
00:18:24,482 --> 00:18:25,310
and I'll show you the route.

320
00:18:25,344 --> 00:18:26,275
Okay.

321
00:18:26,310 --> 00:18:27,931
Okay, see you tomorrow.

322
00:18:27,965 --> 00:18:29,068
Hey.

323
00:18:29,103 --> 00:18:30,517
Did you win your game?

324
00:18:30,551 --> 00:18:31,482
Of course.

325
00:18:31,517 --> 00:18:32,758
Two to nothing.

326
00:18:33,137 --> 00:18:43,137
You don't want to hit

327
00:18:43,172 --> 00:18:53,206
You don't want to hit

328
00:18:53,206 --> 00:19:03,482
You don't want to hit

329
00:19:05,896 --> 00:19:07,206
the geraniums here.

330
00:19:07,241 --> 00:19:09,551
And don't fire low on the next
one or it goes under the porch.

331
00:19:09,586 --> 00:19:11,172
Are you remembering this?

332
00:19:11,206 --> 00:19:13,137
Yeah, yeah, no problem.

I'd be careful with this one
if I were you,

337
00:20:06,689 --> 00:20:08,586
especially with the vases.

338
00:20:08,620 --> 00:20:11,034
Why? What'll happen?

339
00:20:11,068 --> 00:20:21,068
I've never wanted
to find out.

340
00:20:21,103 --> 00:20:29,448
I've never wanted
to find out.

341
00:20:29,482 --> 00:20:32,068
You coming?

342
00:20:33,827 --> 00:20:45,172
So what's with the big house?

343
00:20:51,034 --> 00:20:52,758
You mean the haunted one?

344
00:20:52,793 --> 00:20:56,586
Haunted? Yeah, right.

345
00:20:56,620 --> 00:21:03,448
Do I care if you believe me?

346
00:21:03,482 --> 00:21:05,620
There's a crazy old man
who lives there.

347
00:21:05,655 --> 00:21:07,448
His name is Lyle.

348
00:21:07,482 --> 00:21:10,482
He was a bodyguard
for Tony Murano,

349
00:21:10,517 --> 00:21:13,241
a Chicago Mafia boss
who used to live there

350
00:21:13,275 --> 00:21:17,241
until he got gunned down
in cold blood.

351
00:21:17,275 --> 00:21:21,241
Lyle took a bullet in his head
and they could never get it out.

352
00:21:21,275 --> 00:21:23,620
He's been crazy ever since.

353
00:21:23,655 --> 00:21:27,448
He lives there,
and no one ever sees him.

354
00:21:27,482 --> 00:21:28,310
Yeah, right.

355
00:21:28,344 --> 00:21:30,896
If he never goes out,
how does he eat?

356
00:21:30,931 --> 00:21:32,965
I never said
he never went out.

357
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,379
I said no one ever sees him.

358
00:21:36,413 --> 00:21:37,551
Oh.

359
00:21:37,586 --> 00:21:40,103
And there's also supposed
to be this huge treasure

360
00:21:40,137 --> 00:21:41,551
hidden somewhere in the house.

361
00:21:41,586 --> 00:21:43,068
Mafia blood money.

362
00:21:43,103 --> 00:21:45,827
Guarded by the ghost
of Tony Murano,

363
00:21:45,862 --> 00:21:48,379
and on moonless nights,
people have seen this

364
00:21:48,413 --> 00:21:52,068
flickering candle moving behind
the curtains of the upstairs,

365
00:21:52,103 --> 00:21:54,586
and then there's a wailing moan
that makes your hair

366
00:21:54,620 --> 00:21:57,241
stand up on end.

367
00:21:57,275 --> 00:21:59,068
Golly.

368
00:21:59,103 --> 00:22:02,034
It's fun to have the sounds
of life around this place

369
00:22:02,068 --> 00:22:07,517
again, but I almost dropped
my teeth in the toilet.

370
00:22:07,551 --> 00:22:09,172
Sorry.

371
00:22:09,206 --> 00:22:09,965
Oh, that's all right.

372
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,172
Come on in.

373
00:22:11,206 --> 00:22:13,551
Let's have some breakfast
and you can tell me about it.

374
00:22:13,586 --> 00:22:15,310
Oh, thank you, but I can't.

375
00:22:15,344 --> 00:22:17,551
We're leaving in a half an hour
and I have to pack.

376
00:22:17,586 --> 00:22:18,896
Oh, okay.

377
00:22:18,931 --> 00:22:19,827
Okay, see ya.

378
00:22:19,862 --> 00:22:22,413
See ya.

379
00:22:22,448 --> 00:22:24,862
Watch out for Crazy Lyle.

380
00:22:24,896 --> 00:22:26,448
I'll tell him you said hi.

381
00:22:26,862 --> 00:22:34,172
Crazy Lyle?

382
00:22:36,241 --> 00:22:36,862
Yeah.

383
00:22:36,896 --> 00:22:38,103
The old guy in the mansion.

384
00:22:38,137 --> 00:22:41,034
She says he's totally crazed.

385
00:22:41,068 --> 00:22:43,586
Franklin Lyle?

386
00:22:43,620 --> 00:22:47,517
You know him?

387
00:22:47,551 --> 00:22:49,275
Come on.

388
00:22:49,310 --> 00:22:50,068
Have some breakfast.

389
00:22:50,103 --> 00:22:53,000
I've got some fresh fruit
for you.

390
00:22:53,034 --> 00:22:54,344
Come on.

391
00:22:54,724 --> 00:23:04,827
Yes!

392
00:23:04,862 --> 00:23:14,896
Yes!

393
00:23:14,896 --> 00:23:24,827
Yes!

394
00:23:24,862 --> 00:23:37,448
Yes!

395
00:23:41,103 --> 00:23:54,931
Ah, geez.

396
00:24:16,137 --> 00:24:18,206
That ain't fair.

397
00:24:18,241 --> 00:24:20,827
Bentley, come.

398
00:24:20,862 --> 00:24:23,413
Ah, my man.

399
00:24:23,448 --> 00:24:27,827
Bentley, come.

400
00:24:27,862 --> 00:24:30,310
What are you doing to me,
my man?

401
00:24:30,344 --> 00:24:40,344
Bentley, come here, boy.

402
00:24:40,379 --> 00:24:50,413
Bentley, come here, boy.

403
00:24:50,413 --> 00:24:58,862
Bentley, come here, boy.

404
00:25:04,689 --> 00:25:16,206
Ow.

405
00:25:18,827 --> 00:25:30,724
What?

406
00:25:33,551 --> 00:25:43,586
So what kind of car was it?

407
00:25:43,620 --> 00:25:53,620
So what kind of car was it?

408
00:25:53,620 --> 00:26:03,620
So what kind of car was it?

409
00:26:03,655 --> 00:26:13,689
So what kind of car was it?

410
00:26:13,689 --> 00:26:23,620
So what kind of car was it?

411
00:26:23,655 --> 00:26:36,000
So what kind of car was it?

412
00:26:40,758 --> 00:26:43,413
I don't know,
was big and old.

413
00:26:43,448 --> 00:26:45,413
Big and old? That's it?

414
00:26:45,448 --> 00:26:48,724
Lots of chrome, and I was
facing death by whip.

415
00:26:48,758 --> 00:26:50,965
I wasn't into the car.

416
00:26:56,896 --> 00:26:59,068
Cherry shape?

417
00:26:59,103 --> 00:27:00,241
What?

418
00:27:00,275 --> 00:27:02,931
You know. Perfect shape,
like new.

419
00:27:02,965 --> 00:27:04,172
I think so.

420
00:27:04,206 --> 00:27:07,482
But I didn't get much of a look
before my man here barked.

421
00:27:07,517 --> 00:27:10,206
I have to get into
that garage.

422
00:27:10,241 --> 00:27:11,413
It's an old car.

423
00:27:11,448 --> 00:27:12,827
What do you care?

424
00:27:12,862 --> 00:27:14,310
Cars are cool.

425
00:27:14,344 --> 00:27:16,310
Old cars are the coolest.

426
00:27:16,344 --> 00:27:17,965
You don't want to do this.

427
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,137
Why not?

428
00:27:19,172 --> 00:27:21,275
He's going to be
really upset.

429
00:27:21,310 --> 00:27:22,862
Why?

430
00:27:22,896 --> 00:27:28,241
Well, there's something
I sort of kind of left out.

431
00:27:28,275 --> 00:27:30,206
Remember the vase
you told me about?

432
00:27:30,241 --> 00:27:32,206
Well, I broke it.

433
00:27:32,241 --> 00:27:34,827
Perfect, we'll go apologize.

434
00:27:34,862 --> 00:27:35,620
I tried.

435
00:27:35,655 --> 00:27:37,448
He wouldn't answer the door.

436
00:27:37,482 --> 00:27:39,482
Well then, we'll volunteer
to fix it.

437
00:27:39,517 --> 00:27:41,827
I wouldn't recommend that.

438
00:27:41,862 --> 00:27:42,793
It's my paper route.

439
00:27:42,827 --> 00:27:44,724
I have to, I'm responsible.

440
00:27:44,758 --> 00:27:46,620
Where exactly are you from?

441
00:27:46,655 --> 00:27:48,413
Chicago, why?

442
00:27:48,448 --> 00:27:49,931
Not the 'burbs?

443
00:27:49,965 --> 00:27:52,068
No. How'd you know?

444
00:27:52,103 --> 00:27:56,413
Uh, I take it coming out here
for the summer wasn't your idea.

445
00:27:56,448 --> 00:27:57,586
Not really.

446
00:27:57,620 --> 00:28:01,551
My parents had some idea
it would be some big adventure.

447
00:28:01,586 --> 00:28:03,068
Maybe they were right.

448
00:28:03,482 --> 00:28:08,586
1998 Corvette convertible.

449
00:28:13,827 --> 00:28:15,310
Nice car.

450
00:28:15,344 --> 00:28:17,241
What's it doing here?

451
00:28:17,275 --> 00:28:18,586
Disturbing the peace.

452
00:28:18,620 --> 00:28:20,206
Come on.

453
00:28:20,241 --> 00:28:21,724
You're such a show off.

454
00:28:22,137 --> 00:28:25,896
Maybe we should think

455
00:28:27,551 --> 00:28:29,275
about this.

456
00:28:29,310 --> 00:28:32,586
Maybe make a plan or call
the police first.

457
00:28:32,620 --> 00:28:34,448
Are you chicken?

458
00:28:34,482 --> 00:28:36,310
I'm not chicken, okay?

459
00:28:36,344 --> 00:28:37,517
We have Bentley.

460
00:28:37,551 --> 00:28:39,103
Come here, boy.

461
00:28:39,137 --> 00:28:40,448
He's just scared.

462
00:28:40,896 --> 00:28:53,551
Go ahead.

463
00:28:55,551 --> 00:28:57,896
Go ahead what?

464
00:28:57,931 --> 00:28:59,103
You broke the vase.

465
00:28:59,137 --> 00:29:02,482
You should be the one.

466
00:29:02,517 --> 00:29:04,172
All right.

467
00:29:04,517 --> 00:29:14,551
Itchy?

468
00:29:14,586 --> 00:29:27,758
Itchy?

469
00:29:31,793 --> 00:29:35,172
What's the worst
that can happen?

470
00:29:35,206 --> 00:29:38,896
You selling cookies, boy?

471
00:29:40,827 --> 00:29:44,758
I'm the--was the paper boy--
paper girl--paper girl's

472
00:29:44,793 --> 00:29:45,931
boy helper.

473
00:29:45,965 --> 00:29:48,448
What--what he's trying to
say, sir, is that he broke

474
00:29:48,482 --> 00:29:50,517
your vase yesterday
with the newspaper,

475
00:29:50,551 --> 00:29:53,103
and we've come to help you
fix it, or pay for it,

476
00:29:53,137 --> 00:29:54,344
or whatever.

477
00:29:54,379 --> 00:29:55,689
The vase is broken.

478
00:29:55,724 --> 00:29:57,413
You can't fix it.

479
00:29:57,448 --> 00:29:58,965
Well then, we'll pay for it.

480
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,137
What's to pay for?

481
00:30:01,172 --> 00:30:04,620
On second thought, you will pay.

482
00:30:04,655 --> 00:30:05,758
What's your name, boy?

483
00:30:05,793 --> 00:30:09,758
Mickian--I mean, Mickian.

484
00:30:09,793 --> 00:30:11,689
Ian McKinzie.

485
00:30:11,724 --> 00:30:13,275
I think you know my grandma?

486
00:30:13,310 --> 00:30:14,172
Mimian.

487
00:30:14,206 --> 00:30:15,620
Mimimara.

488
00:30:15,655 --> 00:30:18,172
Mimi McKinzie.

489
00:30:18,206 --> 00:30:19,068
McKinzie?

490
00:30:19,103 --> 00:30:21,137
Yeah.

491
00:30:21,172 --> 00:30:22,448
I don't know her.

492
00:30:22,482 --> 00:30:24,310
Never heard of her.

493
00:30:24,344 --> 00:30:26,586
Her maiden name, Ian.

494
00:30:26,620 --> 00:30:27,655
Applegate.

495
00:30:27,689 --> 00:30:29,000
Pamela Applegate?

496
00:30:29,034 --> 00:30:30,793
Well, why Mimi?

497
00:30:30,827 --> 00:30:33,758
When I was little,
I couldn't say “grandma ”.

498
00:30:33,793 --> 00:30:35,413
Ah, that stands to reason.

499
00:30:35,448 --> 00:30:37,655
All right, then what do you
want to do?

500
00:30:37,689 --> 00:30:42,275
Well, um, do you need any
work done around the house?

501
00:30:42,310 --> 00:30:44,137
Mow the lawn?

502
00:30:44,172 --> 00:30:46,551
Clean the garage?

503
00:30:46,586 --> 00:30:51,448
Yes...yes you come back
tomorrow morning.

504
00:30:51,482 --> 00:30:53,172
Okay, great, see you then.

505
00:30:53,206 --> 00:30:55,517
Oh, and my name's Juliette.

506
00:30:55,965 --> 00:30:58,931
You really want to see that

507
00:31:00,275 --> 00:31:01,758
car, don't you?

508
00:31:02,103 --> 00:31:15,689
♪
♪

509
00:31:25,275 --> 00:31:26,034
I'm sorry, okay?

510
00:31:26,068 --> 00:31:26,827
I apologize.

511
00:31:26,862 --> 00:31:28,000
I was wrong.

512
00:31:28,379 --> 00:31:38,379
Hi.

513
00:31:38,413 --> 00:31:51,862
Hi.

514
00:31:55,862 --> 00:31:57,310
Glenn Miller.

515
00:31:57,344 --> 00:31:58,517
Who?

516
00:31:58,551 --> 00:32:03,620
I had a hankering for some
Glenn Miller, but my partner

517
00:32:03,655 --> 00:32:05,241
can't lead a lick.

518
00:32:05,275 --> 00:32:06,586
Come on.

519
00:32:06,931 --> 00:32:10,275
That's pretty good.

520
00:32:12,344 --> 00:32:14,551
That's pretty good.

521
00:32:14,586 --> 00:32:17,275
Let's go get some lemonade.

522
00:32:17,310 --> 00:32:22,413
I'm going to make you some
fresh asparagus tonight.

523
00:32:22,448 --> 00:32:32,000
Sure was grumpy.

524
00:32:33,724 --> 00:32:35,000
Well, what do you expect
that from--

525
00:32:35,034 --> 00:32:37,172
I meant the old guy, not you.

526
00:32:37,206 --> 00:32:39,793
That can happen
to older people.

527
00:32:39,827 --> 00:32:44,482
Marriage is no antidote
to grumpiness.

528
00:32:44,517 --> 00:32:49,724
He has no family,
and Sally told me that someone

529
00:32:49,758 --> 00:32:52,931
broke his favorite vase
yesterday.

530
00:32:52,965 --> 00:32:56,724
So maybe, just maybe,
he's perturbed about that.

531
00:32:56,758 --> 00:32:58,827
Perturbed and disturbed.

532
00:32:58,862 --> 00:33:02,620
Hoodlums?

533
00:33:02,655 --> 00:33:03,241
Who knows?

534
00:33:03,275 --> 00:33:05,862
It's such an odd thing.

535
00:33:05,896 --> 00:33:07,172
Beautiful old vase.

536
00:33:07,206 --> 00:33:10,379
I mean, it's irreplaceable.

537
00:33:10,413 --> 00:33:14,344
Probably some nut
from Chicago.

538
00:33:14,379 --> 00:33:18,689
Crazy and perturbed, is that
what you think about Mr. Lyle?

539
00:33:18,724 --> 00:33:20,068
Mr. Lyle?

540
00:33:20,103 --> 00:33:23,137
Yes, Franklin Lyle.

541
00:33:23,172 --> 00:33:25,482
I mean, he may seem that way
because he's been holed up

542
00:33:25,517 --> 00:33:29,482
in that old house for 25 years.

543
00:33:29,517 --> 00:33:32,482
I've seen him only a couple
of times in the last few years,

544
00:33:32,517 --> 00:33:34,517
and always from a distance.

545
00:33:34,551 --> 00:33:36,827
But do you know him?

546
00:33:36,862 --> 00:33:38,965
I did.

547
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,793
I did.

548
00:33:40,827 --> 00:33:43,793
Once upon a time.

549
00:33:43,827 --> 00:33:45,275
Was he a gangster?

550
00:33:45,310 --> 00:33:47,172
No.

551
00:33:47,206 --> 00:33:52,655
There's no way, he was
Mr. Murano's chauffeur.

552
00:33:52,689 --> 00:33:54,965
Was Mr. Murano a gangster?

553
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,586
I honestly don't know.

554
00:33:56,620 --> 00:33:59,620
The rest of the Muranos
most certainly were.

555
00:33:59,655 --> 00:34:01,137
I mean, they were always
getting shot up

556
00:34:01,172 --> 00:34:06,896
and being put in jail,
but Mr. Franklin always said

557
00:34:06,931 --> 00:34:14,413
that Mr. Murano--
Tony Murano--was a jeweler,

558
00:34:14,448 --> 00:34:17,896
until they disappeared,
you know?

559
00:34:17,931 --> 00:34:19,206
Who disappeared?

560
00:34:19,241 --> 00:34:20,344
Both of them.

561
00:34:20,379 --> 00:34:21,689
They dropped off the face
of the earth for the better

562
00:34:21,724 --> 00:34:23,931
part of a year.

563
00:34:23,965 --> 00:34:25,413
Where did they go?

564
00:34:25,448 --> 00:34:26,413
I don't know.

565
00:34:26,448 --> 00:34:28,206
They went--they were hiding.

566
00:34:28,241 --> 00:34:32,655
I mean, it was--
there was a--you know,

567
00:34:32,689 --> 00:34:37,034
there was a gang war.

568
00:34:37,068 --> 00:34:40,034
So Tony wasn't gunned down
in cold blood?

569
00:34:40,068 --> 00:34:42,620
No, no, heavens, no.

570
00:34:42,655 --> 00:34:45,896
He died peacefully years later.

571
00:34:45,931 --> 00:34:49,206
Mr. Lyle doesn't have
a bullet in his brain?

572
00:34:49,241 --> 00:34:53,724
Honestly, you know,
you two are morbid.

573
00:34:53,758 --> 00:34:55,344
I never heard about it,
if he did.

574
00:34:55,379 --> 00:34:57,896
I never heard anything
like that, that he was

575
00:34:57,931 --> 00:35:03,551
shot in the head.

576
00:35:03,586 --> 00:35:08,034
What did your friend
tell you?

577
00:35:08,068 --> 00:35:12,103
I never heard from him again.

578
00:35:12,137 --> 00:35:21,068
And then I was swept off my feet
by Ian's granddad.

579
00:35:21,103 --> 00:35:22,965
And the rest is life.

580
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:26,000
So Mr. Lyle must have driven
some pretty cool cars.

581
00:35:26,034 --> 00:35:30,620
I imagine they were cool.

582
00:35:30,655 --> 00:35:32,344
Do you remember what kind
of car your friend drove

583
00:35:32,379 --> 00:35:35,103
Mr. Murano in?

584
00:35:35,137 --> 00:35:37,586
You should ask Mr. Lyle
about the cars.

585
00:35:37,620 --> 00:35:39,000
He'd like that.

586
00:35:39,034 --> 00:35:40,620
Well, maybe next time.

587
00:35:40,655 --> 00:35:41,620
I better go.

588
00:35:41,655 --> 00:35:43,379
I have to pitch at four,
but thanks for lunch.

589
00:35:43,413 --> 00:35:44,655
Have a great game.

590
00:35:44,689 --> 00:35:45,724
Thanks.

591
00:35:45,758 --> 00:35:50,724
Watch that fastball.

592
00:35:50,758 --> 00:35:53,965
Well, the asparagus
was a big hit.

593
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:58,103
I'm going to make some
for tonight and tomorrow.

594
00:35:58,137 --> 00:36:08,206
Huh? What? Oh.

595
00:36:08,241 --> 00:36:14,517
Huh? What? Oh.

596
00:36:14,551 --> 00:36:16,172
What's for sale?

597
00:36:16,206 --> 00:36:17,655
The house?

598
00:36:17,689 --> 00:36:20,034
No wonder he's so grumpy.

599
00:36:40,758 --> 00:36:42,448
Hey!

600
00:36:42,482 --> 00:36:47,724
Hey, hey, come here.

601
00:36:47,758 --> 00:36:50,551
Whatever you're selling,
we don't need it.

602
00:36:50,586 --> 00:36:51,862
Are you buying the house?

603
00:36:51,896 --> 00:36:53,758
I'm selling the house,
little girl.

604
00:36:53,793 --> 00:36:55,724
What, you got a million bucks?

605
00:36:55,758 --> 00:36:59,896
Yeah, but I'm saving up
to buy the Milwaukee Brewers.

606
00:36:59,931 --> 00:37:02,379
We're here to do some work
for Mr. Lyle.

607
00:37:02,413 --> 00:37:04,758
And what kind of work
would that be?

608
00:37:04,793 --> 00:37:06,241
Mow the lawn,
clean the garage,

609
00:37:06,275 --> 00:37:07,896
that kind of thing.

610
00:37:07,931 --> 00:37:10,862
Yeah, yeah, I could see that.

611
00:37:10,896 --> 00:37:11,896
I'll tell you what.

612
00:37:11,931 --> 00:37:16,931
Frank--Mr. Lyle--
isn't here right now, okay?

613
00:37:16,965 --> 00:37:18,758
But I'll tell you what.

614
00:37:18,793 --> 00:37:23,482
Why don't we start off
with a little bonus, okay,

615
00:37:23,517 --> 00:37:24,724
right off the bat.

616
00:37:24,758 --> 00:37:25,965
All right?

617
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:29,413
Okay, here we go, all right?

618
00:37:29,448 --> 00:37:32,068
Now go fix this place up,
and while you're at it,

619
00:37:32,103 --> 00:37:34,137
I want you to keep your eyes
peeled for anything unusual,

620
00:37:34,172 --> 00:37:36,413
okay?

621
00:37:36,448 --> 00:37:39,241
Oh.

622
00:37:39,275 --> 00:37:41,000
I'll be a little more generous.

623
00:37:41,034 --> 00:37:42,206
I'll double it.

624
00:37:42,241 --> 00:37:43,034
Huh?

625
00:37:43,068 --> 00:37:44,344
Okay.

626
00:37:44,379 --> 00:37:46,241
All right.

627
00:37:46,275 --> 00:37:47,241
All right?

628
00:37:47,275 --> 00:37:48,551
Not bad, huh?

629
00:37:48,586 --> 00:37:50,068
Not bad, right,
for doing nothing.

630
00:37:50,103 --> 00:37:52,379
Don't ever say your good old
Uncle Jimmy didn't look

631
00:37:52,413 --> 00:37:53,724
after you, okay?

632
00:37:53,758 --> 00:37:55,655
What exactly are we
looking for?

633
00:37:55,689 --> 00:37:56,689
Any--ooh.

634
00:37:56,724 --> 00:37:58,068
Anything, you know?

635
00:37:58,103 --> 00:37:59,413
Anything unusual.

636
00:37:59,448 --> 00:38:00,413
A bag, a box.

637
00:38:00,448 --> 00:38:03,517
A--does this dog bite?

638
00:38:03,551 --> 00:38:07,620
Usually not.

639
00:38:07,655 --> 00:38:09,310
Bentley, that's not cool.

640
00:38:09,344 --> 00:38:10,689
Kid, could you call your dog?

641
00:38:10,724 --> 00:38:12,551
He's stepping on my shoes.

642
00:38:12,586 --> 00:38:16,482
He's worried about his shoes?

643
00:38:16,517 --> 00:38:19,068
I'm trying, sir,
but if you'll just bear with me

644
00:38:19,103 --> 00:38:21,000
a minute, though,
I'd like to see if he'll

645
00:38:21,034 --> 00:38:22,482
obey to my commands.

646
00:38:22,517 --> 00:38:26,310
You see, he's going to
obedience school, and they

647
00:38:26,344 --> 00:38:27,827
teach ya to test them regularly.

648
00:38:27,862 --> 00:38:33,310
Please, kid, I--I had a bad
experience with a boxer once.

649
00:38:33,344 --> 00:38:35,827
Bentley, no snuffling.

650
00:38:35,862 --> 00:38:37,827
Now, come on, you bad dog.

651
00:38:37,862 --> 00:38:38,689
Right.

652
00:38:38,724 --> 00:38:40,724
Nice--nice--nice dog, okay.

653
00:38:40,758 --> 00:38:42,793
You keep your eyes peeled,
and if you find anything,

654
00:38:42,827 --> 00:38:45,689
you know, unusual, you bring it
to your Uncle Jimmy, okay?

655
00:38:45,724 --> 00:38:48,310
Because there's plenty more
where this came from, all right?

656
00:38:48,344 --> 00:38:49,862
Plenty more, okay?

657
00:38:49,896 --> 00:38:54,206
And next time,
leave the dog at home.

658
00:38:54,241 --> 00:38:56,517
Ooh, big spender.

659
00:38:56,551 --> 00:38:57,965
You stay there.

660
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,655
Stay.

661
00:39:00,689 --> 00:39:03,172
Wouldn't it be cool if there
really were a Mafia treasure

662
00:39:03,206 --> 00:39:05,344
buried around here someplace?

663
00:39:05,379 --> 00:39:06,758
Yeah.

664
00:39:06,793 --> 00:39:08,241
Obedience school?

665
00:39:08,275 --> 00:39:09,896
Are you serious?

666
00:39:09,931 --> 00:39:12,275
Not at all.

667
00:39:18,413 --> 00:39:20,241
Shouldn't we knock first?

668
00:39:20,275 --> 00:39:22,379
Come on.

669
00:39:22,413 --> 00:39:25,586
Bentley, stay there, okay?

670
00:39:26,034 --> 00:39:31,931
Whoa, this is sweet.

671
00:39:34,793 --> 00:39:36,275
Mr. Lyle?

672
00:39:36,310 --> 00:39:37,896
Mr. Lyle.

673
00:39:37,931 --> 00:39:39,103
Mr. Lyle!

674
00:39:39,137 --> 00:39:40,034
Shh.

675
00:39:40,068 --> 00:39:41,241
What do you mean, "Shh"?

676
00:39:41,275 --> 00:39:42,896
Aren't we trying to find him?

677
00:39:42,931 --> 00:39:47,862
Yeah, but--whoa,
look at those.

678
00:39:47,896 --> 00:39:51,310
There's so much old stuff

679
00:39:52,896 --> 00:39:55,103
in that house, it'll take me
weeks to find anything

680
00:39:55,137 --> 00:39:57,068
without some kind of clue.

681
00:39:57,103 --> 00:39:59,965
You know, I'd love to off
the old guy.

682
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,965
Yeah, I got to tell you,
I can't tear the place apart

683
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:07,241
with Lyle watching me like some
type of vulture all the time.

684
00:40:07,275 --> 00:40:09,310
Do you have a plan?

685
00:40:09,344 --> 00:40:13,793
I've retained a couple
of kids to poke around for me.

686
00:40:13,827 --> 00:40:17,206
Yeah, Lyle thinks they're doing
yard work.

687
00:40:17,241 --> 00:40:19,758
What, are you crazy?

688
00:40:19,793 --> 00:40:21,275
If they find the cash,
do you think they're going

689
00:40:21,310 --> 00:40:22,068
to give it to you?

690
00:40:22,103 --> 00:40:24,275
Hey, relax, Camille.

691
00:40:24,310 --> 00:40:26,103
They're just stupid kids,
all right?

692
00:40:26,137 --> 00:40:28,344
They find anything interesting,
they'll bring it to

693
00:40:28,379 --> 00:40:29,724
old Uncle Jimmy, all right?

694
00:40:29,758 --> 00:40:30,586
Trust me.

695
00:40:30,620 --> 00:40:38,689
I made it worth their while. 
Idiot.

696
00:40:38,724 --> 00:40:40,724
Ouch.

697
00:40:40,758 --> 00:40:42,068
Ugh.

698
00:40:42,517 --> 00:40:52,517
Cool.

699
00:40:52,551 --> 00:41:02,655
Cool.

700
00:41:02,655 --> 00:41:12,586
Cool.

701
00:41:12,620 --> 00:41:24,137
Cool.

702
00:41:24,172 --> 00:41:25,137
Rad.

703
00:41:25,448 --> 00:41:30,655
Cool.

704
00:41:32,689 --> 00:41:33,965
Come on.

705
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:35,413
What is it?

706
00:41:35,448 --> 00:41:37,413
Well, looks like an elevator.

707
00:41:37,448 --> 00:41:38,689
Okay.

708
00:41:39,103 --> 00:41:42,000
Let's go.

709
00:41:44,034 --> 00:41:54,068
There you are.

710
00:41:54,103 --> 00:42:02,862
There you are.

711
00:42:06,137 --> 00:42:09,689
You can trim the garden,
all right?

712
00:42:09,724 --> 00:42:11,862
Whoa, those are old.

713
00:42:11,896 --> 00:42:12,620
And you.

714
00:42:12,655 --> 00:42:14,379
You can mow the lawn.

715
00:42:14,413 --> 00:42:18,482
Whoa, this is older.

716
00:42:18,517 --> 00:42:20,137
This is quaint.

717
00:42:20,517 --> 00:42:30,551
Trade ya.

718
00:42:30,586 --> 00:42:42,000
Trade ya.

719
00:42:44,517 --> 00:42:47,655
Sure.

720
00:42:47,689 --> 00:42:51,482
God, these are sharp.

721
00:42:51,517 --> 00:42:52,862
Or not.

722
00:42:53,241 --> 00:43:02,724
Maybe there's some better

723
00:43:04,448 --> 00:43:08,758
tools in the garage.

724
00:43:08,793 --> 00:43:11,413
You mean like a 20-foot long
riding lawn mower

725
00:43:11,448 --> 00:43:12,793
with spoked wheels?

726
00:43:12,827 --> 00:43:15,137
Come on, this is my chance.

727
00:43:15,172 --> 00:43:19,068
Thanks, but I'll stay here
and listen for the death whip.

728
00:43:19,103 --> 00:43:24,448
Okay, just distract him
for me, will ya?

729
00:43:24,482 --> 00:43:26,206
Take care of her, Bentley.

730
00:43:26,586 --> 00:43:39,896
What, she quit already?

731
00:43:42,586 --> 00:43:45,103
I felt sure that she'd--
She, uh, went to get

732
00:43:45,137 --> 00:43:46,758
some newer tools.

733
00:43:47,172 --> 00:43:59,482
She, uh, was looking

734
00:44:01,793 --> 00:44:03,655
for a weed whacker.

735
00:44:03,689 --> 00:44:06,931
Actually, the dog ran in there,
and she ran in after him.

736
00:44:06,965 --> 00:44:09,172
Is there an old car in there
by any chance?

737
00:44:09,206 --> 00:44:11,137
She really likes old cars.

738
00:44:11,172 --> 00:44:14,655
Really.

739
00:44:14,689 --> 00:44:18,137
Are you aware that you have
a 1934 Duesenberg

740
00:44:18,172 --> 00:44:19,620
in mint condition?

741
00:44:19,655 --> 00:44:20,758
Yes.

742
00:44:20,793 --> 00:44:22,620
It's an anniversary edition.

743
00:44:22,655 --> 00:44:24,172
Anniversary edition?

744
00:44:24,206 --> 00:44:25,103
No way.

745
00:44:25,137 --> 00:44:26,655
Yes, ma'am.

746
00:44:27,034 --> 00:44:37,034
I'm sorry, sir.

747
00:44:37,068 --> 00:44:44,517
I'm sorry, sir.

748
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:49,379
I didn't mean to be nosey,
I just wanted to see the car.

749
00:44:49,413 --> 00:44:51,172
I understand.

750
00:44:51,206 --> 00:44:52,000
It's perfect.

751
00:44:52,034 --> 00:44:54,931
We have to take her
out for a ride.

752
00:44:54,965 --> 00:44:56,517
No, I only drive at night.

753
00:44:56,551 --> 00:44:59,620
But everyone in town
should see this car.

754
00:44:59,655 --> 00:45:02,896
Well, the Princess is old.

755
00:45:02,931 --> 00:45:04,517
Just like me.

756
00:45:04,551 --> 00:45:08,551
We come from a different age,
you see, we're like dinosaurs.

757
00:45:08,586 --> 00:45:10,241
What's to show off?

758
00:45:10,275 --> 00:45:11,275
Princess?

759
00:45:11,310 --> 00:45:14,344
Yes, Princess Grace
was Mr. Murano's pet name

760
00:45:14,379 --> 00:45:15,586
for this car.

761
00:45:15,620 --> 00:45:17,620
Mr. Murano gave Princess
to you.

762
00:45:17,655 --> 00:45:20,137
Don't you think he wanted
you to enjoy her?

763
00:45:20,172 --> 00:45:21,931
Hmm.

764
00:45:21,965 --> 00:45:24,482
Grandma would get kick out
of seeing this car.

765
00:45:24,517 --> 00:45:25,862
That's a great idea.

766
00:45:25,896 --> 00:45:29,689
Let's take her over to
your grandma's house.

767
00:45:29,724 --> 00:45:31,793
Your grandmother?

768
00:45:31,827 --> 00:45:34,965
Pamela?

769
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:40,896
Oh, it would be good
to see her again.

770
00:45:40,931 --> 00:45:46,068
And it is a beautiful day out.

771
00:45:46,103 --> 00:45:49,517
Maybe it's time.

772
00:45:49,551 --> 00:45:52,241
Yes.

773
00:45:52,275 --> 00:45:54,965
Maybe it is time.

774
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:57,586
That's it, it's time.

775
00:45:57,620 --> 00:45:58,482
That's what it is.

776
00:45:58,517 --> 00:45:59,310
It's time.

777
00:45:59,344 --> 00:46:00,896
Of course.

778
00:46:01,344 --> 00:46:07,896
Mademoiselle.

779
00:46:11,310 --> 00:46:12,724
Thank you.

780
00:46:12,758 --> 00:46:16,344
Monsieur.

781
00:46:16,379 --> 00:46:17,758
Come on, Bentley.

782
00:46:17,793 --> 00:46:19,103
Bentley.

783
00:46:19,137 --> 00:46:20,965
He sounds like a butler.

784
00:46:21,379 --> 00:46:31,379
Look at the car.

785
00:46:31,413 --> 00:46:41,448
Look at the car.

786
00:46:41,448 --> 00:46:51,379
Look at the car.

787
00:46:51,413 --> 00:47:03,137
Look at the car.

788
00:47:06,241 --> 00:47:07,655
It's a beauty!

789
00:47:08,068 --> 00:47:20,758
How is your grandmother?

790
00:47:23,172 --> 00:47:26,724
We were friends
a long, long time ago.

791
00:47:26,758 --> 00:47:30,241
Well, she's just as crazy
as ever.

792
00:47:30,275 --> 00:47:31,827
Crazy?

793
00:47:31,862 --> 00:47:33,620
Well, not crazy.

794
00:47:33,655 --> 00:47:34,931
I was just joking.

795
00:47:34,965 --> 00:47:37,586
Ah, she's a fine lady.

796
00:47:37,620 --> 00:47:39,310
She's always danced
to her own music,

797
00:47:39,344 --> 00:47:41,344
but she's a fine lady.

798
00:47:41,379 --> 00:47:51,379
Your grandfather was
a very lucky man.

799
00:47:51,413 --> 00:47:59,551
Your grandfather was
a very lucky man.

800
00:47:59,586 --> 00:48:03,310
Say, are you expected home
soon?

801
00:48:03,344 --> 00:48:05,551
Well, yeah, sometime.

802
00:48:05,586 --> 00:48:07,206
My grandma's out shopping.

803
00:48:07,241 --> 00:48:08,379
Oh.

804
00:48:08,758 --> 00:48:12,379
But they can't throw you out.

805
00:48:14,344 --> 00:48:15,517
It's not right.

806
00:48:15,551 --> 00:48:18,103
It's your home.

807
00:48:18,137 --> 00:48:20,827
I don't know what you heard,
but it's my home all right,

808
00:48:20,862 --> 00:48:21,827
but it's not my house.

809
00:48:21,862 --> 00:48:24,724
You see, once the taxes
are paid off the rest

810
00:48:24,758 --> 00:48:26,137
goes to little Jimmy.

811
00:48:26,172 --> 00:48:27,793
That guy back there?

812
00:48:27,827 --> 00:48:31,413
I thought he was just
some real estate dweeb.

813
00:48:31,448 --> 00:48:33,068
What'd you say, dear?

814
00:48:33,103 --> 00:48:34,413
Oh, nothing, sir.

815
00:48:34,793 --> 00:48:36,896
You know, Mr. Lyle,

816
00:48:38,379 --> 00:48:40,482
you're pretty awesome
with that whip.

817
00:48:40,517 --> 00:48:44,172
Uh, how long have you been,
um, cracking one?

818
00:48:44,206 --> 00:48:46,896
Oh, I saw that Indiana fellow
do it in the movies

819
00:48:46,931 --> 00:48:49,310
and I thought it'd be
a good way to scare off

820
00:48:49,344 --> 00:48:52,137
the pigeons. 
Pigeons and other birds

821
00:48:52,172 --> 00:48:55,655
like chickens?

822
00:48:55,689 --> 00:48:56,517
What'd you say?

823
00:48:56,551 --> 00:48:58,103
Oh, nothing sir.

824
00:48:58,482 --> 00:49:08,551
Good afternoon, Ms. Pamela.

825
00:49:08,586 --> 00:49:16,172
Good afternoon, Ms. Pamela.

826
00:49:21,896 --> 00:49:23,965
Afternoon, Franklin.

827
00:49:24,379 --> 00:49:27,206
She is as lovely as ever.

828
00:49:30,517 --> 00:49:31,551
Grace, Grandma.

829
00:49:31,586 --> 00:49:32,965
He calls her Princess Grace.

830
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:33,758
Oh, yes, Grace.

831
00:49:33,793 --> 00:49:37,137
I knew it was something
like that.

832
00:49:37,172 --> 00:49:40,793
How did you kids get Mr. Lyle
to drive you around

833
00:49:40,827 --> 00:49:43,931
in this beautiful car?

834
00:49:43,965 --> 00:49:46,965
Been a long time, hasn't it?

835
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:48,793
Indeed it has.

836
00:49:49,206 --> 00:49:53,655
Mr. Lyle drove us around

837
00:49:55,482 --> 00:49:57,413
the lake.

838
00:49:57,448 --> 00:49:58,344
The lake?

839
00:49:58,379 --> 00:50:03,206
He drove us all the way
around the county.

840
00:50:03,241 --> 00:50:05,344
We just took off
on the spur of the moment,

841
00:50:05,379 --> 00:50:07,000
but we should have called you.

842
00:50:07,034 --> 00:50:10,172
I'd like to make amends
by offering you a ride tomorrow.

843
00:50:10,206 --> 00:50:12,517
Thank you, I accept.

844
00:50:12,551 --> 00:50:14,344
Tomorrow, then?

845
00:50:14,379 --> 00:50:16,793
Yes, tomorrow.

846
00:50:16,827 --> 00:50:18,517
Wonderful.

847
00:50:18,551 --> 00:50:22,655
Oh, kids, I'll put your bikes
in the garage, kids.

848
00:50:22,689 --> 00:50:23,000
Bye!

849
00:50:23,034 --> 00:50:24,448
Bye bye.

850
00:50:24,482 --> 00:50:24,965
Bye bye!

851
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:26,655
See you, Mr. Lyle.

852
00:50:26,689 --> 00:50:28,448
That car was so awesome.

853
00:50:28,482 --> 00:50:30,965
It is awesome.

854
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:32,965
And he was such a cutie.

855
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:34,413
A cutie?

856
00:50:34,448 --> 00:50:35,896
Well, I thought he was.

857
00:50:35,931 --> 00:50:38,482
He was so sweet to your grandma,
and he's not a ghoul

858
00:50:38,517 --> 00:50:40,482
as we thought he was.

859
00:50:40,517 --> 00:50:44,896
I'm sorry, but when he cracks
that whip, he's scary.

860
00:50:44,931 --> 00:50:47,620
I heard someone once say that
you shouldn't judge a man

861
00:50:47,655 --> 00:50:50,689
until you've walked a mile
in his shoes--here.

862
00:50:50,724 --> 00:50:53,000
Well, we haven't told you
what's going to happen.

863
00:50:53,034 --> 00:50:55,931
Mr. Lyle can't afford to
pay the taxes, and Jimmy's

864
00:50:55,965 --> 00:50:58,172
going to sell the house
at the sheriff's sale.

865
00:50:58,206 --> 00:51:00,931
And Mr. Lyle's going to have
to sleep in his car.

866
00:51:00,965 --> 00:51:02,965
Oh, don't tell me
all this now.

867
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:05,275
We'll wait until we get home
and we'll talk all about it,

868
00:51:05,310 --> 00:51:06,206
all right?

869
00:51:06,241 --> 00:51:07,931
All right.

870
00:51:07,965 --> 00:51:10,827
The sale is tomorrow at noon?

871
00:51:10,862 --> 00:51:14,275
On the Fourth of July?

872
00:51:14,310 --> 00:51:16,551
What can we do
with so little time?

873
00:51:16,586 --> 00:51:18,689
Why doesn't he just sell
the car to pay the taxes?

874
00:51:18,724 --> 00:51:21,689
Yeah, he hardly ever drives
it anyway.

875
00:51:21,724 --> 00:51:23,517
The man is a chauffeur.

876
00:51:23,551 --> 00:51:26,586
The car is dear to him.

877
00:51:26,620 --> 00:51:29,758
I mean, I don't know about you,
but when I was young,

878
00:51:29,793 --> 00:51:33,724
being a chauffeur was
an occupation that a man could

879
00:51:33,758 --> 00:51:35,931
be proud of, don't you know?

880
00:51:35,965 --> 00:51:38,655
Maybe we could talk him into
selling the car.

881
00:51:38,689 --> 00:51:39,517
We have to.

882
00:51:39,551 --> 00:51:41,931
We can't let Mr. Lyle
lose his home.

883
00:51:41,965 --> 00:51:45,034
Especially if Jimmy's going
to get the money.

884
00:51:45,068 --> 00:51:46,827
I was wondering when
you two were going to

885
00:51:46,862 --> 00:51:48,724
bring up the treasure.

886
00:51:48,758 --> 00:51:50,034
Oh, come on, Grandma.

887
00:51:50,068 --> 00:51:52,896
You don't really believe in
that stuff, do you?

888
00:51:52,931 --> 00:51:54,448
Yeah, this is the real world.

889
00:51:54,482 --> 00:51:59,620
It's a matter of life and death.

890
00:51:59,655 --> 00:52:02,034
Besides, if there really were
a treasure, wouldn't he have

891
00:52:02,068 --> 00:52:03,241
found it by now?

892
00:52:03,310 --> 00:52:06,310
Mrs. Applegate, you need to
help us talk him into selling

893
00:52:06,344 --> 00:52:08,793
Grace.

894
00:52:08,827 --> 00:52:11,275
The car is just such a part
of Franklin, it would break

895
00:52:11,310 --> 00:52:13,517
my heart.

896
00:52:13,551 --> 00:52:15,344
We'll post her on the web.

897
00:52:15,379 --> 00:52:18,103
Great idea.

898
00:52:18,137 --> 00:52:19,517
Don't worry, Mrs. Applegate.

899
00:52:19,551 --> 00:52:21,241
Everything's going to be okay.

900
00:52:21,275 --> 00:52:22,827
You wouldn't want him
to be homeless, would you?

901
00:52:22,862 --> 00:52:24,896
Yeah, you're right.

902
00:52:24,931 --> 00:52:27,793
I'm just being sentimental.

903
00:52:27,827 --> 00:52:28,724
Thanks for lunch.

904
00:52:28,758 --> 00:52:30,724
Everything was delicious.

905
00:52:30,758 --> 00:52:32,103
Meet me for my route?

906
00:52:32,137 --> 00:52:34,586
Sure.

907
00:52:37,137 --> 00:52:40,000
That girl has charisma.

908
00:52:40,413 --> 00:52:43,827
So, my man.

909
00:52:45,517 --> 00:52:47,448
What are we going to do?

910
00:52:47,482 --> 00:52:49,965
We can't let Mr. Lyle
lose his home.

911
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,655
I mean, that would really
bum Grandma out.

912
00:52:52,689 --> 00:52:57,000
Can't let that happen.

913
00:52:57,034 --> 00:53:00,103
If you were a hidden treasure,
where would you be?

914
00:53:00,137 --> 00:53:02,689
We really got to get you

915
00:53:04,034 --> 00:53:05,689
a new toy, don't we?

916
00:53:06,103 --> 00:53:10,758
Someone wants to talk to you.

917
00:53:16,206 --> 00:53:18,310
Thanks.

918
00:53:18,344 --> 00:53:19,172
Goodnight.

919
00:53:19,206 --> 00:53:20,689
It's a girl.

920
00:53:20,724 --> 00:53:26,172
Goodnight.

921
00:53:26,206 --> 00:53:27,827
Jules?

922
00:53:27,862 --> 00:53:28,517
Jules?

923
00:53:28,551 --> 00:53:29,758
Who's Jules?

924
00:53:29,793 --> 00:53:32,172
Oh, it's you, Icky.

925
00:53:32,206 --> 00:53:33,689
You got a girlfriend already?

926
00:53:33,724 --> 00:53:36,000
Guess those cows really do
like you.

927
00:53:36,034 --> 00:53:37,862
Yeah, right.

928
00:53:37,896 --> 00:53:41,172
So, do you miss me so bad?

929
00:53:41,206 --> 00:53:42,827
Yeah, so bad,
I sold all your stuff

930
00:53:42,862 --> 00:53:44,448
and I'm renting out your room.

931
00:53:44,482 --> 00:53:46,517
Ha ha ha.

932
00:53:46,551 --> 00:53:48,137
So, how are Mom and Dad?

933
00:53:48,172 --> 00:53:51,034
I just got a postcard
from them, they're doing great.

934
00:53:51,068 --> 00:53:52,896
Cool.

935
00:53:52,931 --> 00:53:54,413
Hey, Birdbrain.

936
00:53:54,448 --> 00:53:56,034
Huh?

937
00:53:56,068 --> 00:53:57,724
I miss you.

938
00:53:57,758 --> 00:53:59,931
And that freak dog of yours.

939
00:54:00,413 --> 00:54:10,413
Hi.

940
00:54:10,448 --> 00:54:20,482
Hi.

941
00:54:20,482 --> 00:54:29,137
Hi.

942
00:54:31,758 --> 00:54:32,827
Thanks, Jules.

943
00:54:33,275 --> 00:54:42,586
Thanks!

944
00:54:44,931 --> 00:54:46,379
Looks like it's going to be

945
00:54:47,793 --> 00:54:50,758
a great Fourth of July parade
this year.

946
00:54:50,793 --> 00:54:52,241
Looks like it.

947
00:54:52,275 --> 00:54:53,482
Hi, kids.

948
00:54:53,827 --> 00:55:03,931
Let's get our bikes

949
00:55:03,965 --> 00:55:14,000
Let's get our bikes

950
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:20,379
Let's get our bikes

951
00:55:22,689 --> 00:55:24,137
and come back later.

952
00:55:24,172 --> 00:55:28,103
Yeah.

953
00:55:28,137 --> 00:55:31,034
Hey.

954
00:55:31,068 --> 00:55:32,827
Look at that.

955
00:55:33,241 --> 00:55:46,482
What's he doing?

956
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:50,862
I don't know.

957
00:55:50,896 --> 00:55:52,344
Let's ask Mr. Lyle.

958
00:55:52,793 --> 00:56:07,724
Should we call the police
first?

959
00:56:12,413 --> 00:56:14,103
Why, what are you thinking?

960
00:56:14,137 --> 00:56:17,551
Nothing,
but it's not even seven.

961
00:56:17,586 --> 00:56:19,103
Where would he be so early?

962
00:56:19,137 --> 00:56:21,275
Do you think Jimmy's
burying him in the yard?

963
00:56:21,310 --> 00:56:22,655
I never said that.

964
00:56:22,689 --> 00:56:26,241
That's what you were
thinking.

965
00:56:26,275 --> 00:56:27,965
Okay, I was.

966
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:29,068
So were you.

967
00:56:29,379 --> 00:56:43,689
Old junk.

968
00:56:46,241 --> 00:56:53,551
Yeah, look, I'm telling you.

969
00:56:55,655 --> 00:56:58,034
I dug up the entire backyard.

970
00:56:58,068 --> 00:57:00,620
Camille, the money's not here,
all right?

971
00:57:00,655 --> 00:57:02,275
I hope you're being careful.

972
00:57:02,310 --> 00:57:03,586
What are you talking about?

973
00:57:03,620 --> 00:57:04,551
Pussycat, you know me.

974
00:57:04,586 --> 00:57:05,620
I'm Mr. Careful.

975
00:57:05,655 --> 00:57:06,965
Oh!

976
00:57:07,344 --> 00:57:14,000
Ugh.

977
00:57:15,689 --> 00:57:18,379
Like you were Mr. Careful
with your money.

978
00:57:18,413 --> 00:57:21,517
Do I have to hear about that
for the rest of my life?

979
00:57:21,551 --> 00:57:23,586
Camille?

980
00:57:23,620 --> 00:57:24,758
Oh, come on.

981
00:57:24,793 --> 00:57:27,413
I've looked all over the place.

982
00:57:27,448 --> 00:57:29,275
I tried that.

983
00:57:29,310 --> 00:57:30,137
Hey, hey.

984
00:57:30,172 --> 00:57:32,310
Hey, Camille, back off.

985
00:57:32,344 --> 00:57:35,241
Come on.

986
00:57:35,275 --> 00:57:37,413
You know something?

987
00:57:37,448 --> 00:57:39,344
What, what?

988
00:57:39,379 --> 00:57:42,827
Camille.

989
00:57:42,862 --> 00:57:44,241
Camille?

990
00:57:44,275 --> 00:57:46,000
You know, I gotta tell you,
this place is like--

991
00:57:46,034 --> 00:57:47,551
it's driving me crazy.

992
00:57:47,586 --> 00:57:48,586
What about the old man?

993
00:57:48,620 --> 00:57:50,448
Hey, you don't worry
about Frank, all right?

994
00:57:50,482 --> 00:57:53,413
The old man is taken care of.

995
00:57:53,448 --> 00:57:54,172
Oh, the kids.

996
00:57:54,206 --> 00:57:55,448
Oh.

997
00:57:55,482 --> 00:57:57,344
I'm telling you, the kids are--
they're driving me crazy.

998
00:57:57,379 --> 00:57:59,551
Those little con artists,
they vanished with my money.

999
00:57:59,586 --> 00:58:02,379
I gotta tell you, I'm tired
of digging in the dirt.

1000
00:58:02,413 --> 00:58:04,517
Did you--did you check
the garage?

1001
00:58:04,551 --> 00:58:06,103
Look, I turned it inside
and out.

1002
00:58:06,137 --> 00:58:07,034
The basement?

1003
00:58:07,068 --> 00:58:09,034
It isn't in there.

1004
00:58:09,068 --> 00:58:11,517
Look, Camille, can't you like
look into your little

1005
00:58:11,551 --> 00:58:19,310
crystal ball or do like
a trance, or do something?

1006
00:58:19,344 --> 00:58:20,482
Nervy broad.

1007
00:58:20,517 --> 00:58:23,206
Jerk.

1008
00:58:23,241 --> 00:58:24,758
Oh no.

1009
00:58:25,206 --> 00:58:35,724
What now?

1010
00:58:37,551 --> 00:58:39,689
We got to find Mr. Lyle.

1011
00:58:39,724 --> 00:58:42,655
Ha, I knew I'd find you
little weasels back here.

1012
00:58:42,689 --> 00:58:44,620
Real funny.

1013
00:58:44,655 --> 00:58:47,931
Should have seen the looks
on your faces.

1014
00:58:47,965 --> 00:58:49,517
Ha Ha Ha.

1015
00:58:49,551 --> 00:58:51,862
So, did you find anything
interesting telling

1016
00:58:51,896 --> 00:58:53,310
your Uncle Jimmy about?

1017
00:58:53,344 --> 00:58:55,241
No, we're just here
delivering papers.

1018
00:58:55,275 --> 00:58:56,758
And get our own bikes.

1019
00:58:56,793 --> 00:58:58,103
Oh.

1020
00:58:58,137 --> 00:59:00,931
Oh, well, I don't think this
partnership is going to work.

1021
00:59:00,965 --> 00:59:02,275
Here's your two dollars back.

1022
00:59:02,310 --> 00:59:03,379
Wait a minute.

1023
00:59:03,413 --> 00:59:04,551
Hey, hey.

1024
00:59:04,586 --> 00:59:06,241
This was good faith money.

1025
00:59:06,275 --> 00:59:07,448
You offend me.

1026
00:59:07,482 --> 00:59:10,068
I'm sorry, but it's better
this way.

1027
00:59:10,103 --> 00:59:14,275
No, you offend me,
you offend my family.

1028
00:59:14,310 --> 00:59:18,275
And this, nah ah,
can't be forgiven.

1029
00:59:18,310 --> 00:59:21,103
Geez, it's only two dollars.

1030
00:59:21,137 --> 00:59:22,172
Imma tell you something.

1031
00:59:22,206 --> 00:59:24,482
I'm going to give you a little
bit of free advice.

1032
00:59:24,517 --> 00:59:27,965
First, you can cease and desist
on the paper route, all right?

1033
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:30,724
'Cause Frank ain't reading
papers no more, okay?

1034
00:59:30,758 --> 00:59:32,103
That's right.

1035
00:59:32,137 --> 00:59:35,896
And second, you can take
your bikes out of the garage

1036
00:59:35,931 --> 00:59:38,310
before they get auctioned,
okay?

1037
00:59:38,344 --> 00:59:41,103
And last, I want you
to beat it and I don't

1038
00:59:41,137 --> 00:59:44,931
want you to come back, okay?

1039
00:59:44,965 --> 00:59:45,689
Bentley?

1040
00:59:45,724 --> 00:59:46,896
Where's a Bentley?

1041
00:59:46,931 --> 00:59:48,137
Uh, nice dog.

1042
00:59:48,172 --> 00:59:49,724
Nice Bentley.

1043
00:59:49,758 --> 00:59:51,586
Nice dog, okay?

1044
00:59:51,620 --> 00:59:53,482
All right, easy, easy, easy.

1045
00:59:53,517 --> 00:59:55,586
Hey, kid, I gotta tell you,
you're gonna push me a little

1046
00:59:55,620 --> 00:59:58,586
bit too far with this
dog routine, all right?

1047
00:59:58,620 --> 01:00:00,793
Bentley's a very nice dog.

1048
01:00:00,827 --> 01:00:02,896
You should see his tricks.

1049
01:00:02,931 --> 01:00:03,896
Leave.

1050
01:00:03,931 --> 01:00:09,965
Come on, I got nowhere to go.

1051
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:11,724
Ow.

1052
01:00:11,758 --> 01:00:14,241
Hey, kid.

1053
01:00:14,275 --> 01:00:14,896
That's right.

1054
01:00:14,931 --> 01:00:15,827
That's right.

1055
01:00:15,862 --> 01:00:26,068
Gonna have to do something
about that dog.

1056
01:00:26,103 --> 01:00:31,586
Gonna have to do something
about that dog.

1057
01:00:31,620 --> 01:00:33,931
I told you we should have
called the police.

1058
01:00:33,965 --> 01:00:35,103
Let's tell your grandma.

1059
01:00:35,137 --> 01:00:36,965
She'll know what to do.

1060
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:38,000
He wasn't anywhere.

1061
01:00:38,068 --> 01:00:40,137
Unless he was locked up
somewhere in the house.

1062
01:00:40,172 --> 01:00:41,793
Or buried in the yard.

1063
01:00:41,827 --> 01:00:43,482
Oh, come on, now.

1064
01:00:43,517 --> 01:00:47,034
There's probably some perfectly
sensible explanation.

1065
01:00:47,068 --> 01:00:47,862
No.

1066
01:00:47,896 --> 01:00:49,586
We heard Jimmy talking
on the phone.

1067
01:00:49,620 --> 01:00:52,172
He said the old guy
was taken care of.

1068
01:00:52,206 --> 01:00:54,689
Exact words, and he said that
Mr. Lyle wouldn't be needing

1069
01:00:54,724 --> 01:00:56,758
his newspapers anymore.

1070
01:00:56,793 --> 01:00:58,413
We saw Jimmy digging
in the yard,

1071
01:00:58,448 --> 01:01:00,241
like he was burying something.

1072
01:01:00,275 --> 01:01:02,310
Or looking for the money.

1073
01:01:02,344 --> 01:01:02,965
The money.

1074
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:05,172
Definitely looking for it.

1075
01:01:05,206 --> 01:01:08,000
We heard him talking about
that too.

1076
01:01:08,034 --> 01:01:15,000
Look.

1077
01:01:16,517 --> 01:01:18,034
There he is.

1078
01:01:18,068 --> 01:01:19,931
Follow him.

1079
01:01:19,965 --> 01:01:21,620
What, who, follow who?

1080
01:01:21,655 --> 01:01:22,724
That car.

1081
01:01:22,758 --> 01:01:23,620
It's Jimmy.

1082
01:01:23,655 --> 01:01:24,275
Oh, heavens.

1083
01:01:24,310 --> 01:01:25,896
I can't keep up with him.

1084
01:01:25,931 --> 01:01:28,827
He might be the key.

1085
01:01:28,862 --> 01:01:32,517
He could lead us to Mr. Lyle.

1086
01:01:32,551 --> 01:01:36,482
Well, that's a job
for the sheriff.

1087
01:01:36,517 --> 01:01:41,137
Besides, Jimmy is one
of the other Muranos.

1088
01:01:41,172 --> 01:01:43,482
He might shoot ya.

1089
01:01:43,896 --> 01:01:52,206
I can't see the car.

1090
01:01:55,344 --> 01:02:05,413
See, no answer.

1091
01:02:05,448 --> 01:02:15,931
See, no answer.

1092
01:02:21,379 --> 01:02:22,620
Locked.

1093
01:02:22,655 --> 01:02:24,206
We better go around the back.

1094
01:02:24,241 --> 01:02:26,310
I want to see
what he was digging.

1095
01:02:26,344 --> 01:02:27,689
Me too.

1096
01:02:27,724 --> 01:02:31,103
It looks just like a grave.

1097
01:02:31,137 --> 01:02:34,379
Looks to me like some fool
digging for treasure

1098
01:02:34,413 --> 01:02:36,689
without a map.

1099
01:02:36,724 --> 01:02:38,896
Bentley's found something.

1100
01:02:38,931 --> 01:02:42,517
I don't think one
of the other Muranos would be

1101
01:02:42,551 --> 01:02:46,551
burying a body in the garden
under the broad daylight.

1102
01:02:46,586 --> 01:02:48,551
Grandma, you haven't seen
this guy in action.

1103
01:02:48,586 --> 01:02:49,206
Huh?

1104
01:02:49,241 --> 01:02:51,275
He's nuts.

1105
01:02:51,310 --> 01:02:52,379
What is it, Bentley?

1106
01:02:52,413 --> 01:02:53,896
It's a shoe.

1107
01:02:53,931 --> 01:02:54,689
Oh, my gosh.

1108
01:02:54,724 --> 01:02:56,068
Is there a foot?

1109
01:02:56,103 --> 01:02:58,344
I don't see one.

1110
01:02:58,379 --> 01:03:02,137
There hasn't been a foot
in that boot for 20 years.

1111
01:03:02,172 --> 01:03:03,965
No foot, no body.

1112
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:09,137
Now how did that dog know
that that boot was in there?

1113
01:03:09,172 --> 01:03:10,793
Bentley loves shoes.

1114
01:03:10,827 --> 01:03:13,241
I had to give him that toy
so he would stop chewing

1115
01:03:13,275 --> 01:03:15,000
on my tennis shoes.

1116
01:03:15,413 --> 01:03:18,896
Franklin.

1117
01:03:20,241 --> 01:03:21,724
Mr. Lyle?

1118
01:03:21,758 --> 01:03:24,000
What a surprise.

1119
01:03:24,034 --> 01:03:30,344
We were just--well, the kids
came by earlier and they saw

1120
01:03:30,379 --> 01:03:32,137
Mr. Murano's nephew.

1121
01:03:32,172 --> 01:03:35,172
He was digging in this hole,
and they couldn't find you

1122
01:03:35,206 --> 01:03:38,137
anywhere, so they--
well, they thought maybe that

1123
01:03:38,172 --> 01:03:41,000
something had happened to you,
so they brought me out here.

1124
01:03:41,034 --> 01:03:46,310
I didn't think for a moment
that anything had happened

1125
01:03:46,344 --> 01:03:47,655
to you.

1126
01:03:47,689 --> 01:03:50,965
But you did disappear
really fast

1127
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:54,793
and you shouldn't do that.

1128
01:03:54,827 --> 01:03:57,965
I'm sorry, but the picture
of little Jimmy burying me

1129
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:00,137
here in the garden.

1130
01:04:00,172 --> 01:04:03,241
It just hit my funny bone.

1131
01:04:03,275 --> 01:04:06,689
Well, what was little Jimmy
digging a hole for?

1132
01:04:06,724 --> 01:04:08,551
What was he burying?

1133
01:04:08,586 --> 01:04:11,482
What's he--
What?

1134
01:04:11,517 --> 01:04:14,275
He's looking for the stash,
Grandma.

1135
01:04:14,310 --> 01:04:15,965
Is that it, Franklin?

1136
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:16,931
Well, I don't know.

1137
01:04:16,965 --> 01:04:19,758
He's probably heard
an old rumor somewhere.

1138
01:04:19,793 --> 01:04:21,551
I don't think there
are six inches in this

1139
01:04:21,586 --> 01:04:26,241
whole place that he hasn't
poked his nose into.

1140
01:04:26,275 --> 01:04:29,758
Well, is there any truth
to it, Franklin?

1141
01:04:29,793 --> 01:04:33,655
Well, Mr. Murano's been gone
now for about, what, 27 years,

1142
01:04:33,689 --> 01:04:36,517
and I've never run across it.

1143
01:04:36,551 --> 01:04:38,275
Never wanted to either.

1144
01:04:38,310 --> 01:04:41,172
Why not?

1145
01:04:41,206 --> 01:04:46,068
Well, I've seen too much
trouble come from money.

1146
01:04:46,103 --> 01:04:49,517
Speaking of money, Franklin,
I understand you're about to be

1147
01:04:49,551 --> 01:04:53,034
homeless.

1148
01:04:53,068 --> 01:04:55,482
Well, it seems that
my pension just can't keep up

1149
01:04:55,517 --> 01:04:59,137
with these darn taxes.

1150
01:04:59,172 --> 01:05:03,586
Do retired gangsters
get pensions?

1151
01:05:03,620 --> 01:05:06,482
You see, the real story
was that Mr. Murano

1152
01:05:06,517 --> 01:05:08,206
was not a gangster.

1153
01:05:08,241 --> 01:05:12,137
He was a wholesale jeweler,
but when the gangsters went

1154
01:05:12,172 --> 01:05:16,724
after the family in 1948,
they went after him too, simply

1155
01:05:16,758 --> 01:05:18,655
because his name was Murano.

1156
01:05:19,103 --> 01:05:29,103
The closest they came was one

1157
01:05:29,137 --> 01:05:39,172
The closest they came was one

1158
01:05:39,172 --> 01:05:47,586
The closest they came was one

1159
01:05:50,931 --> 01:05:54,620
day outside of Bartolo's
Restaurant in Chicago.

1160
01:05:54,655 --> 01:05:58,551
I opened the car door for him

1161
01:06:00,517 --> 01:06:03,862
and he gave me a funny look,
said he'd like to sit up front

1162
01:06:03,896 --> 01:06:06,793
with me, that he had
something for me.

1163
01:06:06,827 --> 01:06:09,206
I saw a little box in his hand.

1164
01:06:09,241 --> 01:06:12,551
For some reason,
I glanced up across the roof

1165
01:06:12,586 --> 01:06:17,172
of the car and saw a gun.

1166
01:06:17,206 --> 01:06:19,137
I pushed Mr. Murano
onto the floor

1167
01:06:19,172 --> 01:06:20,965
and dove in behind the wheel.

1168
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:25,827
I could feel the bullets
hitting Gracie.

1169
01:06:25,862 --> 01:06:28,896
And that was just about it.

1170
01:06:28,931 --> 01:06:32,517
We all went into hiding
for about six months.

1171
01:06:32,551 --> 01:06:36,379
It seemed like forever,
and then we all went home,

1172
01:06:36,413 --> 01:06:38,689
and Murano family
was pretty much

1173
01:06:38,724 --> 01:06:40,655
finished after that.

1174
01:06:40,689 --> 01:06:41,413
Yeah.

1175
01:06:41,448 --> 01:06:43,413
What was in the box?

1176
01:06:43,448 --> 01:06:48,172
Ha ha, never found out,
and it was never mentioned.

1177
01:06:48,206 --> 01:06:49,896
Franklin, it's been 50 years.

1178
01:06:49,931 --> 01:06:53,379
Nobody even knows if you exist,
much less remembers the money.

1179
01:06:53,413 --> 01:06:55,413
You know you're about to be
evicted.

1180
01:06:55,448 --> 01:06:58,827
Is there a stash or not?

1181
01:06:58,862 --> 01:07:04,206
Well, as he was nearing his
end, Mr. Murano gave me Grace

1182
01:07:04,241 --> 01:07:07,034
as a bonus for that day
in front of Bartolo's.

1183
01:07:07,068 --> 01:07:10,413
He said, "You take good care
of her, and she'll take

1184
01:07:10,448 --> 01:07:12,241
good care of you. ”
Oh, for Pete's sake.

1185
01:07:12,275 --> 01:07:16,862
I don't know what
you're talking about.

1186
01:07:16,896 --> 01:07:20,517
The answer's got to be
in the car, right?

1187
01:07:20,551 --> 01:07:22,551
Right, I guess it is.

1188
01:07:23,034 --> 01:07:25,379
Okay, all right.

1189
01:07:27,896 --> 01:07:35,724
Mr. Lyle, I think I found

1190
01:07:37,758 --> 01:07:38,931
something.

1191
01:07:38,965 --> 01:07:40,517
What?

1192
01:07:40,551 --> 01:07:42,620
I don't know what this is.

1193
01:07:42,655 --> 01:07:46,034
I've never seen that before.

1194
01:07:46,068 --> 01:07:50,931
Hey, this looks like
Mr. Murano's handwriting.

1195
01:07:50,965 --> 01:07:53,517
Well, what does it say?

1196
01:07:53,551 --> 01:07:55,344
Let's see.

1197
01:07:55,379 --> 01:08:00,034
"The only way
is the old mill way. ”

1198
01:08:00,068 --> 01:08:01,103
A riddle?

1199
01:08:01,137 --> 01:08:02,758
A riddle?

1200
01:08:02,793 --> 01:08:05,103
Well, what does that mean?

1201
01:08:05,137 --> 01:08:05,862
The old mill.

1202
01:08:05,896 --> 01:08:07,344
The old mill.

1203
01:08:07,379 --> 01:08:09,793
Well, Mr. Murano owned
the old mill up there

1204
01:08:09,827 --> 01:08:13,103
on Red Rock River.

1205
01:08:13,137 --> 01:08:16,275
Hey, but it hasn't been used
in years, I mean--

1206
01:08:16,310 --> 01:08:16,862
Oh, no.

1207
01:08:16,896 --> 01:08:19,275
No, no, no.

1208
01:08:19,310 --> 01:08:20,206
Well, then, let's go.

1209
01:08:20,241 --> 01:08:21,448
Let's go out there.

1210
01:08:21,482 --> 01:08:22,586
Come on, Lyle.

1211
01:08:22,620 --> 01:08:23,482
Let's go.

1212
01:08:23,517 --> 01:08:24,413
Get away.

1213
01:08:24,448 --> 01:08:25,448
Hey, hey, stop it.

1214
01:08:25,482 --> 01:08:26,103
Stop.

1215
01:08:26,137 --> 01:08:27,793
Hey, knock it off.

1216
01:08:27,827 --> 01:08:29,137
Hey!

1217
01:08:29,517 --> 01:08:36,827
Where'd you get this,

1218
01:08:38,413 --> 01:08:39,103
Bentley?

1219
01:08:39,137 --> 01:08:40,931
Looks like an expensive shoe.

1220
01:08:40,965 --> 01:08:43,275
Must be Uncle Jimmy's.

1221
01:08:43,310 --> 01:08:46,344
Hey, hey!

1222
01:08:46,379 --> 01:08:48,758
Keep your eye on the time.

1223
01:08:48,793 --> 01:08:50,689
It's 10:29.

1224
01:08:51,137 --> 01:08:57,241
It's the regret of my life,

1225
01:08:59,034 --> 01:09:00,724
my dear.

1226
01:09:00,758 --> 01:09:02,172
Tony and I were like rabbits.

1227
01:09:02,206 --> 01:09:06,931
We were running, hiding,
reading obituaries.

1228
01:09:06,965 --> 01:09:10,172
But you, you were constantly
in my mind.

1229
01:09:10,206 --> 01:09:12,931
You were the light at the end,
believe me.

1230
01:09:12,965 --> 01:09:15,586
Not a word, Franklin.

1231
01:09:15,620 --> 01:09:17,034
In six months.

1232
01:09:17,068 --> 01:09:19,896
But I didn't want
to get you involved.

1233
01:09:19,931 --> 01:09:22,172
Ah, but it's all over with now.

1234
01:09:22,206 --> 01:09:26,344
The blackest day of my life
though was when I came home

1235
01:09:26,379 --> 01:09:32,379
and found that--found that
you'd got married.

1236
01:09:32,413 --> 01:09:35,172
Oh, Franklin.

1237
01:09:35,206 --> 01:09:36,724
So this is the clue.

1238
01:09:36,758 --> 01:09:39,689
"The only way
is the old mill way."

1239
01:09:39,724 --> 01:09:41,172
What does it mean?

1240
01:09:41,206 --> 01:09:44,068
What did you and Mr. Murano
used to do there?

1241
01:09:44,103 --> 01:09:50,241
You see, Mr. Murano loved

1242
01:09:52,413 --> 01:09:55,310
the game of cards and won
the mill in a poker game, but

1243
01:09:55,344 --> 01:09:58,172
as a respectable businessman,
he didn't want to be

1244
01:09:58,206 --> 01:10:01,344
caught gambling,
so he asked me to cut some slots

1245
01:10:01,379 --> 01:10:03,758
in the floor under his table.

1246
01:10:03,793 --> 01:10:06,551
Now if the maître d'
signaled that the police

1247
01:10:06,586 --> 01:10:09,482
were coming, the players
all dropped their cards

1248
01:10:09,517 --> 01:10:10,551
through the floor.

1249
01:10:10,931 --> 01:10:21,068
You kids know the best hand

1250
01:10:23,206 --> 01:10:24,275
in poker?

1251
01:10:24,310 --> 01:10:25,172
A royal flush.

1252
01:10:25,206 --> 01:10:26,482
That's correct.

1253
01:10:26,517 --> 01:10:28,724
You can play poker
your whole life

1254
01:10:28,758 --> 01:10:30,379
and never hold one.

1255
01:10:30,413 --> 01:10:34,551
But one night, Mr. Murano
drew a royal flush just as

1256
01:10:34,586 --> 01:10:36,517
the cops pulled up outside.

1257
01:10:36,551 --> 01:10:38,551
So what did he do?

1258
01:10:38,586 --> 01:10:41,482
He dropped the cards
through the floor.

1259
01:10:41,517 --> 01:10:42,724
Did he get caught?

1260
01:10:42,758 --> 01:10:43,793
No, no, no.

1261
01:10:43,827 --> 01:10:47,413
But he cried about it
for years, but from then on,

1262
01:10:47,448 --> 01:10:55,068
the card drop was called
the Royal Flush.

1263
01:10:55,103 --> 01:10:57,000
Bar is open.

1264
01:10:57,034 --> 01:10:58,517
Sweet.

1265
01:10:58,551 --> 01:11:01,551
This is cool.

1266
01:11:01,586 --> 01:11:04,758
So, this used to be
an old gangster's hangout?

1267
01:11:04,793 --> 01:11:07,793
No, it was called
the Old Mill Tavern.

1268
01:11:07,827 --> 01:11:17,827
Yes, I am feeling good,

1269
01:11:17,862 --> 01:11:27,896
Yes, I am feeling good,

1270
01:11:27,896 --> 01:11:37,862
Yes, I am feeling good,

1271
01:11:37,896 --> 01:11:44,413
Yes, I am feeling good,

1272
01:11:47,965 --> 01:11:48,965
pussycat.

1273
01:11:49,379 --> 01:11:55,172
These idiots are going to

1274
01:11:56,620 --> 01:11:58,413
lead me to my uncle's fortune.

1275
01:11:58,448 --> 01:11:59,379
I'll tell you what.

1276
01:11:59,413 --> 01:12:01,655
You make sure that the sale
goes off right,

1277
01:12:01,689 --> 01:12:03,482
and I'm telling you,
when we're done we're going

1278
01:12:03,517 --> 01:12:05,413
to make out like bandits.

1279
01:12:05,448 --> 01:12:07,068
Okay, listen.

1280
01:12:07,103 --> 01:12:08,827
If they find the money,
don't panic.

1281
01:12:08,862 --> 01:12:10,137
Legally, it's probably yours.

1282
01:12:10,172 --> 01:12:11,034
We can file it in court.

1283
01:12:11,068 --> 01:12:13,724
We can get it back,
but whatever you do,

1284
01:12:13,758 --> 01:12:17,137
do not let them get back here
in time to ruin the sale.

1285
01:12:17,172 --> 01:12:20,896
Oh, and Jimmy,
don't shoot anyone, darling.

1286
01:12:20,931 --> 01:12:22,241
All right.

1287
01:12:22,275 --> 01:12:25,965
Women lawyers.

1288
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:28,586
So where did Mr. Murano
used to sit?

1289
01:12:28,620 --> 01:12:31,517
Well, if I remember
correctly,

1290
01:12:31,551 --> 01:12:35,310
he used to sit with his back
up against the wall,

1291
01:12:35,344 --> 01:12:39,620
right about in here.

1292
01:12:39,655 --> 01:12:45,793
And, yup, there's all the--
what's this?

1293
01:12:45,827 --> 01:12:47,655
You a lawyer?

1294
01:12:47,689 --> 01:12:49,551
Yes.

1295
01:12:49,586 --> 01:12:51,827
You lawyers are always in
such a hurry to get back

1296
01:12:51,862 --> 01:12:54,137
to other people's problems.

1297
01:12:54,172 --> 01:12:55,862
Read it, honey.

1298
01:12:55,896 --> 01:12:59,827
"When thirsty hounds
tops the hill,

1299
01:12:59,862 --> 01:13:02,724
turn your back upon the heart."

1300
01:13:02,758 --> 01:13:03,758
What?

1301
01:13:03,793 --> 01:13:08,620
"At the top of noon,
but not o'clock, you will

1302
01:13:08,655 --> 01:13:13,931
find your final start. ”
 “Thirsty hound ”?

1303
01:13:13,965 --> 01:13:17,862
What does a dry dog

1304
01:13:19,310 --> 01:13:21,275
have to do with anything?

1305
01:13:21,310 --> 01:13:22,310
Not dog.

1306
01:13:22,344 --> 01:13:23,758
Hound.

1307
01:13:23,793 --> 01:13:25,068
So?

1308
01:13:25,103 --> 01:13:26,137
Dog, hound.

1309
01:13:26,172 --> 01:13:27,448
What's the difference?

1310
01:13:27,482 --> 01:13:28,862
What?

1311
01:13:28,896 --> 01:13:30,586
Thirsty hound is a dry dog.

1312
01:13:30,620 --> 01:13:31,655
Yes, that's right.

1313
01:13:31,689 --> 01:13:33,172
Dry Dog Road.

1314
01:13:33,206 --> 01:13:35,000
Of course.

1315
01:13:35,034 --> 01:13:38,724
Up on the hill
on Dry Dog Road.

1316
01:13:38,758 --> 01:13:39,862
But where did he go?

1317
01:13:39,896 --> 01:13:41,689
We're going to go up
on Dry Dog Road,

1318
01:13:41,724 --> 01:13:43,379
see what's up on top
of that hill.

1319
01:13:43,413 --> 01:13:45,068
Okay, let's go.

1320
01:13:45,103 --> 01:13:46,827
Let me tell you something.

1321
01:13:46,862 --> 01:13:48,655
I've always held
that punctuality is just

1322
01:13:48,689 --> 01:13:54,275
a waste of time, especially
on a national holiday.

1323
01:13:54,310 --> 01:13:57,620
I'm sorry, it's just that
I have a long ride back

1324
01:13:57,655 --> 01:13:59,896
to Chicago this afternoon.

1325
01:14:00,310 --> 01:14:10,413
Well, what do you know.

1326
01:14:10,448 --> 01:14:20,482
Well, what do you know.

1327
01:14:20,482 --> 01:14:25,758
Well, what do you know.

1328
01:14:28,689 --> 01:14:30,689
It's still there.

1329
01:14:30,724 --> 01:14:34,310
What's all this about
a heart and a clock?

1330
01:14:34,344 --> 01:14:36,965
I think that tree
is our answer.

1331
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:40,689
Up there, that tree.

1332
01:14:42,862 --> 01:14:43,275
Okay.

1333
01:14:43,310 --> 01:14:45,172
Okay.

1334
01:14:45,620 --> 01:14:56,965
Why, that silly old heart.

1335
01:14:59,931 --> 01:15:03,103
It's still there
after all this time.

1336
01:15:03,137 --> 01:15:06,862
Yes, Ms. Pamela, and this
silly old heart is still here

1337
01:15:06,896 --> 01:15:10,379
too, after all this time.

1338
01:15:10,413 --> 01:15:11,793
I'm glad.

1339
01:15:11,827 --> 01:15:16,034
I'm truly glad, Franklin.

1340
01:15:16,068 --> 01:15:19,344
What the heck is up
with those two?

1341
01:15:19,379 --> 01:15:22,275
Looks like they have
the hots for each other.

1342
01:15:22,310 --> 01:15:28,172
You're kidding, right?

1343
01:15:28,206 --> 01:15:28,827
Hey, look.

1344
01:15:28,862 --> 01:15:30,413
I found the heart.

1345
01:15:30,862 --> 01:15:35,241
I turned my back on it.

1346
01:15:37,206 --> 01:15:38,241
Now what?

1347
01:15:38,275 --> 01:15:39,689
Wait till noon?

1348
01:15:39,724 --> 01:15:40,965
How long is that?

1349
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:44,482
If we wait till noon,
Franklin is homeless.

1350
01:15:44,517 --> 01:15:45,689
No.

1351
01:15:45,724 --> 01:15:48,172
Top of noon.

1352
01:15:48,206 --> 01:15:50,275
That's 12 o'clock.

1353
01:15:50,310 --> 01:15:51,379
Right!

1354
01:15:51,413 --> 01:15:54,068
Well then it must mean
direction, and if directions

1355
01:15:54,103 --> 01:15:58,241
are like the figures of a clock,
then 12 o'clock must be--

1356
01:15:58,275 --> 01:16:00,551
Well, straight ahead.

1357
01:16:00,586 --> 01:16:01,724
Exactly.

1358
01:16:01,758 --> 01:16:03,448
Straight ahead is trees.

1359
01:16:03,482 --> 01:16:05,586
About a zillion of them.

1360
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:07,896
All I see is a barn

1361
01:16:09,586 --> 01:16:11,448
and a silo.

1362
01:16:11,482 --> 01:16:12,758
Where?

1363
01:16:12,793 --> 01:16:17,137
At 12 o'clock.

1364
01:16:17,172 --> 01:16:18,689
What's the next clue?

1365
01:16:18,724 --> 01:16:19,517
Oh.

1366
01:16:19,551 --> 01:16:24,034
Hey, I've got it.

1367
01:16:24,068 --> 01:16:24,965
Oh.

1368
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:28,275
"A barn and silo
atop the mound,

1369
01:16:28,310 --> 01:16:30,551
go back to Grace
and follow the hound. ”

1370
01:16:30,586 --> 01:16:31,862
That's it.

1371
01:16:31,896 --> 01:16:34,103
Time check.

1372
01:16:34,137 --> 01:16:38,793
11:13
You bet.

1373
01:16:38,827 --> 01:16:39,931
Told you, come on.

1374
01:16:39,965 --> 01:16:41,310
Okay, come on!

1375
01:16:41,724 --> 01:16:51,724
"Park in the barn

1376
01:16:51,758 --> 01:17:01,862
"Park in the barn

1377
01:17:01,862 --> 01:17:09,103
"Park in the barn

1378
01:17:13,827 --> 01:17:15,655
and head up top.

1379
01:17:15,689 --> 01:17:19,103
Where a cow has a kit
is your final stop. ”

1380
01:17:19,137 --> 01:17:21,793
Let's follow the directions
and see what happens.

1381
01:17:21,827 --> 01:17:24,206
Listen, could you kids
open those two doors?

1382
01:17:24,241 --> 01:17:26,034
Double time!

1383
01:17:26,068 --> 01:17:27,620
Uh, 11:30.

1384
01:17:27,655 --> 01:17:29,517
Let's go.

1385
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:40,000
Franklin, was Mr. Murano

1386
01:17:40,034 --> 01:17:50,068
Franklin, was Mr. Murano

1387
01:17:50,068 --> 01:18:00,000
Franklin, was Mr. Murano

1388
01:18:00,034 --> 01:18:09,448
Franklin, was Mr. Murano

1389
01:18:14,206 --> 01:18:16,413
the kind of man that would
leave the crucial bit

1390
01:18:16,448 --> 01:18:18,724
of information in a barn?

1391
01:18:18,758 --> 01:18:21,241
I mean, this isn't exactly
Fort Knox.

1392
01:18:21,275 --> 01:18:22,862
No, he wasn't a very
practical man,

1393
01:18:22,896 --> 01:18:24,379
and matter of fact,
he never even learned

1394
01:18:24,413 --> 01:18:27,689
how to drive properly.

1395
01:18:27,724 --> 01:18:29,689
When does a cow have a kit?

1396
01:18:29,724 --> 01:18:31,793
When a dog lays an egg.

1397
01:18:31,827 --> 01:18:35,068
There's nothing up here
but hay.

1398
01:18:35,103 --> 01:18:38,068
Take a look at the note.

1399
01:18:38,103 --> 01:18:41,689
"Where a cow has a kit
is your final stop. ”

1400
01:18:41,724 --> 01:18:44,241
Mm, kit, not a kitten?

1401
01:18:44,275 --> 01:18:46,344
Kit.

1402
01:18:46,379 --> 01:18:48,379
Uh, what's that?

1403
01:18:48,413 --> 01:18:50,482
It's the animal
first aid kit.

1404
01:18:50,517 --> 01:18:51,931
Every barn has one.

1405
01:18:51,965 --> 01:18:53,413
My mom calls it a cow kit.

1406
01:18:53,448 --> 01:18:55,413
So, where is it?

1407
01:18:55,448 --> 01:18:58,241
It's normally just some box
on the wall.

1408
01:18:58,275 --> 01:19:08,344
I knew this was going

1409
01:19:08,379 --> 01:19:18,241
I knew this was going

1410
01:19:20,517 --> 01:19:23,000
to happen.

1411
01:19:23,034 --> 01:19:24,482
It got lost.

1412
01:19:24,517 --> 01:19:25,689
Dead end.

1413
01:19:25,724 --> 01:19:28,310
Okay, okay, he'll be here.

1414
01:19:28,344 --> 01:19:30,275
Herb's been our auctioneer
for 15 years

1415
01:19:30,310 --> 01:19:32,724
and he hasn't been late yet.

1416
01:19:32,758 --> 01:19:34,379
Maybe he's stuck
in parade traffic.

1417
01:19:34,413 --> 01:19:36,000
Got a big parade today,
you know.

1418
01:19:36,034 --> 01:19:39,344
Fine, but this sale starts
at the crack of noon.

1419
01:19:39,379 --> 01:19:41,620
That's in 13 minutes,
not a second after,

1420
01:19:41,655 --> 01:19:44,172
and if he's not here,
you're going to do it.

1421
01:19:44,206 --> 01:19:49,931
Look.

1422
01:19:52,344 --> 01:19:56,103
Something was there before,
but the screw's rusted off.

1423
01:19:56,137 --> 01:19:59,103
It's got to be buried
in the hay somewhere, right?

1424
01:19:59,137 --> 01:19:59,586
Right.

1425
01:19:59,620 --> 01:20:00,655
Ow.

1426
01:20:00,689 --> 01:20:02,068
What--What is it?

1427
01:20:02,103 --> 01:20:03,172
Something metal.

1428
01:20:03,206 --> 01:20:07,000
I hope it's the first aid kit,
so we can fix my toe.

1429
01:20:07,034 --> 01:20:11,931
Score.

1430
01:20:14,275 --> 01:20:23,689
What, what is it, kids?

1431
01:20:25,310 --> 01:20:28,931
Look what we found.

1432
01:20:28,965 --> 01:20:32,689
For heaven's sakes.

1433
01:20:32,724 --> 01:20:36,034
What's it say?

1434
01:20:36,068 --> 01:20:41,137
"Frank, here is a small token
of appreciation I tried to

1435
01:20:41,172 --> 01:20:45,034
present to you one evening years
ago, but fate intervened.

1436
01:20:45,068 --> 01:20:49,793
Because of your loyalty to me,
you lost the love of your life.

1437
01:20:49,827 --> 01:20:54,241
I am forever grateful
and forever sorry.

1438
01:20:54,275 --> 01:20:57,344
A reminder to explore
Grace's secrets.

1439
01:20:57,379 --> 01:21:01,344
When you step up to Grace,
your fortune is underfoot.

1440
01:21:01,379 --> 01:21:03,793
Your friend, Tony.

1441
01:21:03,827 --> 01:21:06,379
Please forgive the clumsy
mystery.

1442
01:21:06,413 --> 01:21:10,827
Better cryptic
than in a crypt."

1443
01:21:10,862 --> 01:21:12,034
Hold on to that, sweetheart.

1444
01:21:12,068 --> 01:21:16,931
What's in the pack?

1445
01:21:16,965 --> 01:21:19,862
Oh, my goodness.

1446
01:21:19,896 --> 01:21:25,827
This is what he meant to
give me that night years ago.

1447
01:21:25,862 --> 01:21:27,517
Listen to this.

1448
01:21:27,551 --> 01:21:31,172
"A reminder to explore
Grace's secrets.

1449
01:21:31,206 --> 01:21:36,379
When you step up to Grace,
your fortune is underfoot."

1450
01:21:36,413 --> 01:21:38,344
It's got to be in the car.

1451
01:21:38,379 --> 01:21:41,241
It's so obvious.

1452
01:21:41,275 --> 01:21:44,655
Oh, oh, my little friends.

1453
01:21:44,689 --> 01:21:47,517
I'm glad to see you kept our end
of the bargain, right?

1454
01:21:47,551 --> 01:21:48,689
Huh, you know what?

1455
01:21:48,724 --> 01:21:49,896
You should have kept the good
faith money, all right,

1456
01:21:49,931 --> 01:21:51,827
'cause I'm a man of my word,
and I certainly would have

1457
01:21:51,862 --> 01:21:53,448
paid you your finder's fee,
all right.

1458
01:21:53,482 --> 01:21:54,241
Get up.

1459
01:21:54,275 --> 01:21:55,827
Hey, not so fast.

1460
01:21:55,862 --> 01:21:57,000
You know, I got to tell you.

1461
01:21:57,034 --> 01:21:58,862
I'm not a man of violence
or anything,

1462
01:21:58,896 --> 01:22:00,758
but there's certainly is
a lot at stake here,

1463
01:22:00,793 --> 01:22:02,344
isn't there?

1464
01:22:02,379 --> 01:22:05,689
You know, I'm sorry to say
this, Jimmy, but you are a fool.

1465
01:22:05,724 --> 01:22:07,068
You always have been.

1466
01:22:07,103 --> 01:22:08,482
I'm a fool?

1467
01:22:08,517 --> 01:22:11,482
I'm over here with all kinds
of possibilities,

1468
01:22:11,517 --> 01:22:13,655
and you're over there
high and dry, huh?

1469
01:22:13,689 --> 01:22:15,206
Who's a fool?

1470
01:22:15,241 --> 01:22:17,379
Move it.

1471
01:22:17,413 --> 01:22:21,137
Back up...back up.

1472
01:22:21,172 --> 01:22:25,068
Why, Frank, is this where
the secret compartment is, huh?

1473
01:22:25,103 --> 01:22:26,482
Is this where the cash is at?

1474
01:22:26,517 --> 01:22:28,448
Ah, let's see, let's see.

1475
01:22:28,482 --> 01:22:29,965
What do we have here?

1476
01:22:30,379 --> 01:22:39,551
Okay.

1477
01:22:41,241 --> 01:22:43,275
Why don't you at least stay
for today's Fourth of July

1478
01:22:43,310 --> 01:22:45,103
festivities?

1479
01:22:45,137 --> 01:22:48,896
Some of us have nail
appointments we have to keep.

1480
01:22:48,931 --> 01:22:50,068
Hello?

1481
01:22:50,103 --> 01:22:51,103
Hey, pussycat.

1482
01:22:51,137 --> 01:22:53,758
You know, you can charge
everything in the whole

1483
01:22:53,793 --> 01:22:57,172
entire world on a credit card,
and it's not half the rush

1484
01:22:57,206 --> 01:23:02,931
of finding a few hundred
thousand in cold, hard cash.

1485
01:23:02,965 --> 01:23:07,482
I found it.

1486
01:23:07,517 --> 01:23:08,482
Jimmy?

1487
01:23:08,517 --> 01:23:09,689
Jimmy?

1488
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:17,482
Oh, God.

1489
01:23:20,517 --> 01:23:22,827
Where's that auctioneer?

1490
01:23:22,862 --> 01:23:23,517
Oh, ow.

1491
01:23:23,551 --> 01:23:24,758
Here, come on.

1492
01:23:25,172 --> 01:23:30,310
Here, here.

1493
01:23:33,275 --> 01:23:38,206
Hey, hey.

1494
01:23:39,793 --> 01:23:40,655
Nice dog.

1495
01:23:40,689 --> 01:23:41,517
Nice dog.

1496
01:23:41,551 --> 01:23:49,758
That's a nice dog. 
Geez, nice bull.

1497
01:23:49,793 --> 01:23:51,482
Bulls and cows.

1498
01:23:51,517 --> 01:23:53,068
Camille will blend in.

1499
01:23:53,517 --> 01:24:03,758
Suppose we ought

1500
01:24:05,206 --> 01:24:09,000
to get started, Herb.

1501
01:24:09,034 --> 01:24:11,034
Um, sorry about that.

1502
01:24:11,068 --> 01:24:15,586
Had a hard time getting across
the parade route.

1503
01:24:15,620 --> 01:24:25,620
We're going to get started
here.

1504
01:24:25,655 --> 01:24:34,413
We're going to get started
here.

1505
01:24:39,068 --> 01:24:41,862
This lovely parcel includes
the house here,

1506
01:24:41,896 --> 01:24:45,448
and the building as well
as a 40-acre hobby farm

1507
01:24:45,482 --> 01:24:47,827
down on Dry Dog Road.

1508
01:24:47,862 --> 01:24:49,724
Is that Zone A-1,
Sheriff Burke?

1509
01:24:49,758 --> 01:24:51,586
I believe that's zoned
for agriculture, Herb,

1510
01:24:51,620 --> 01:24:55,137
but we could--
Get a move on.

1511
01:24:55,172 --> 01:25:02,517
You carry on, Herb.

1512
01:25:03,931 --> 01:25:07,482
I'll take a look-see
at these plot maps here.

1513
01:25:07,517 --> 01:25:09,551
Please bear in mind
the rather large extent

1514
01:25:09,586 --> 01:25:12,448
of the holdings here as we begin
the bidding, because

1515
01:25:12,482 --> 01:25:14,448
we will start accordingly.

1516
01:25:14,482 --> 01:25:16,344
It is five after noon.

1517
01:25:16,379 --> 01:25:17,517
Let's get started.

1518
01:25:17,551 --> 01:25:21,241
You don't want to see me
get angry.

1519
01:25:21,275 --> 01:25:23,241
I'm going to start
the bidding at $800k.

1520
01:25:23,275 --> 01:25:24,655
Do I hear 800 thousand?

1521
01:25:24,689 --> 01:25:26,103
Looking at a bid of $800-.

1522
01:25:26,137 --> 01:25:28,034
Do I hear that $800k?

1523
01:25:28,068 --> 01:25:29,172
He's gaining on us, Mr. Lyle.

1524
01:25:32,275 --> 01:25:35,068
Time check.

1525
01:25:36,793 --> 01:25:38,448
12:07.

1526
01:25:38,862 --> 01:25:41,793
He's got a gun.

1527
01:25:43,517 --> 01:25:44,620
Uh oh.

1528
01:25:44,655 --> 01:25:45,620
Gun it, Franklin.

1529
01:25:45,655 --> 01:25:46,965
We can make it, come on.

1530
01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:51,413
Get that $950 bid.

1531
01:25:51,448 --> 01:25:52,931
Faster.

1532
01:25:53,344 --> 01:25:56,241
Who's this guy think he is?

1533
01:25:58,344 --> 01:26:00,000
James Bond?

1534
01:26:00,034 --> 01:26:03,172
That sounds just a little
bit too familiar.

1535
01:26:03,206 --> 01:26:05,724
I don't think that boy
could hit the broad side

1536
01:26:05,758 --> 01:26:07,413
of a silo with that thing.

1537
01:26:07,448 --> 01:26:09,655
Murano's never could
shoot straight.

1538
01:26:09,689 --> 01:26:11,827
Too bad for their line of work.

1539
01:26:11,862 --> 01:26:13,310
I've got $950--a cool mil.

1540
01:26:13,344 --> 01:26:14,344
Who will make it a mil?

1541
01:26:14,379 --> 01:26:16,103
A bargain at twice the price.

1542
01:26:16,551 --> 01:26:26,551
Looking at a million dollars.

1543
01:26:26,586 --> 01:26:35,000
Looking at a million dollars.

1544
01:26:38,310 --> 01:26:41,793
Okay, kids, quick.

1545
01:26:44,103 --> 01:26:45,655
Run up and tell them to stop
the sale.

1546
01:26:45,689 --> 01:26:50,137
Tell them that we've got
the money for the taxes.

1547
01:26:50,172 --> 01:26:51,068
Keep going.

1548
01:26:51,103 --> 01:26:51,896
The sale is underway.

1549
01:26:51,931 --> 01:26:54,172
You can't stop now.

1550
01:26:54,206 --> 01:26:55,413
Stop the sale.

1551
01:26:55,448 --> 01:26:56,862
Stop, he has the money.

1552
01:26:56,896 --> 01:26:58,172
Hold it, hold it.

1553
01:26:58,206 --> 01:26:59,862
Now, what are you saying.

1554
01:26:59,896 --> 01:27:01,931
This is outrageous.

1555
01:27:01,965 --> 01:27:04,931
Lady, I've had just about
enough out of you.

1556
01:27:04,965 --> 01:27:08,482
Now, excuse me,
but shut your trap.

1557
01:27:08,517 --> 01:27:10,965
Mr. Lyle has the tax money.

1558
01:27:11,000 --> 01:27:13,551
You got to stop.

1559
01:27:13,586 --> 01:27:15,137
Who is he?

1560
01:27:15,172 --> 01:27:17,137
Mr. Lyle.

1561
01:27:17,172 --> 01:27:18,689
Frank has the money.

1562
01:27:18,724 --> 01:27:22,448
Yeah, we'll show it to you.

1563
01:27:22,482 --> 01:27:24,172
You better hold on here
a minute, Herb, till I get

1564
01:27:24,206 --> 01:27:25,931
this all cleared up.

1565
01:27:25,965 --> 01:27:29,172
Uh, we're going to take just
a moment here, folks, please.

1566
01:27:29,206 --> 01:27:31,000
I'm going to take you
to court.

1567
01:27:31,034 --> 01:27:34,448
I'm going to sue every one
of you country bumpkins.

1568
01:27:34,482 --> 01:27:37,344
And I'm going to put you
in jail if I hear one more peep

1569
01:27:37,379 --> 01:27:41,655
out of you.

1570
01:27:41,689 --> 01:27:42,620
Sir, please.

1571
01:27:42,655 --> 01:27:46,655
Now, if you'd be so good
as to slow down

1572
01:27:46,689 --> 01:27:48,068
and talk one at a time.

1573
01:27:48,103 --> 01:27:51,241
Okay, see, it's--
One at a time.

1574
01:27:51,275 --> 01:27:53,241
Please.

1575
01:27:53,275 --> 01:27:56,620
Sir, Mr. Lyle has the money
to pay the taxes.

1576
01:27:56,655 --> 01:28:07,689
Hey, hey.

1577
01:28:09,689 --> 01:28:10,689
Hold it right there.

1578
01:28:10,724 --> 01:28:12,000
Hold it right there.

1579
01:28:12,034 --> 01:28:14,137
Hold on a second.

1580
01:28:14,172 --> 01:28:15,310
Listen up, young feller.

1581
01:28:15,344 --> 01:28:17,310
Are you going to
behave yourself?

1582
01:28:17,344 --> 01:28:18,206
He'll be fine, Sheriff.

1583
01:28:18,241 --> 01:28:18,931
He'll be fine.

1584
01:28:18,965 --> 01:28:21,000
He's--I'll take care of him.

1585
01:28:21,034 --> 01:28:21,482
Come on.

1586
01:28:21,517 --> 01:28:25,310
He's my client.

1587
01:28:25,344 --> 01:28:31,655
Okay, you hold tight and
we'll deal with him momentarily.

1588
01:28:31,689 --> 01:28:35,517
Frank, you sure you can come
up with that kind of money?

1589
01:28:35,551 --> 01:28:37,724
I believe I can, Sheriff.

1590
01:28:37,758 --> 01:28:39,482
And it's all legal
and everything?

1591
01:28:39,517 --> 01:28:42,413
Yes, it is, Sheriff.

1592
01:28:42,448 --> 01:28:45,000
Well, then,
that's all I need.

1593
01:28:45,034 --> 01:28:50,896
Herb, folks, we appreciate you
coming by today, but it looks

1594
01:28:50,931 --> 01:28:54,310
like our current occupant can
make his tax payment after all.

1595
01:28:54,344 --> 01:28:57,689
Since we're small town, and we
like to take care of our own,

1596
01:28:57,724 --> 01:28:59,517
we're going to cancel today's
auction.

1597
01:28:59,551 --> 01:29:00,827
Thank you very much
for coming out,

1598
01:29:00,862 --> 01:29:02,862
and have a happy Fourth of July.

1599
01:29:02,896 --> 01:29:04,551
Goodbye.

1600
01:29:04,586 --> 01:29:05,689
How about--
It's over.

1601
01:29:05,724 --> 01:29:09,172
Did we--
It's over, Jimmy.

1602
01:29:09,206 --> 01:29:17,586
So, what you doing

1603
01:29:19,758 --> 01:29:22,103
for the rest of the summer?

1604
01:29:22,137 --> 01:29:22,931
I don't know.

1605
01:29:22,965 --> 01:29:25,379
How about another adventure?

1606
01:29:31,000 --> 01:29:34,068
You know, Mr. Murano used
to say, "There are plenty of

1607
01:29:34,103 --> 01:29:40,379
tomorrows, but only one today. ”
Well, in that case, Franklin,

1608
01:29:40,413 --> 01:29:43,862
I think it's plenty
of yesterdays.

1609
01:29:43,896 --> 01:29:52,758
Ms. Pamela, Mimi, I would be

1610
01:29:58,310 --> 01:30:03,344
very honored if you would accept
this ring.

1611
01:30:03,379 --> 01:30:07,344
It's always been yours anyway,
and I'd just like you

1612
01:30:07,379 --> 01:30:10,241
to have it.

1613
01:30:10,275 --> 01:30:13,379
Regardless of how you answer
my next question,

1614
01:30:13,413 --> 01:30:16,931
I want you to have it,
but would you entertain

1615
01:30:16,965 --> 01:30:22,034
the idea of marrying me
and living our tomorrows

1616
01:30:22,068 --> 01:30:26,172
together in this old house?

1617
01:30:26,206 --> 01:30:39,862
Oh, well, Franklin,
50 years late.

1618
01:30:39,896 --> 01:30:42,896
It's better late than never.

1619
01:30:42,931 --> 01:30:44,586
Yes.

1620
01:30:44,620 --> 01:30:46,482
Yes.

1621
01:30:46,517 --> 01:30:49,793
Oh, finally.

1622
01:30:49,827 --> 01:30:52,517
I don't even care
