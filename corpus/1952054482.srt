1
00:00:24,870 --> 00:00:26,428
This is fucking bullshit.

2
00:00:55,101 --> 00:00:57,296
All right. Let's fucking do this.

3
00:01:17,590 --> 00:01:20,252
We're gonna be fucking downstairs,
you don't fucking stop.

4
00:02:00,599 --> 00:02:02,226
You fucking assholes!

5
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:16,746
Hey, should we turn this off?

6
00:02:37,236 --> 00:02:39,568
- Get the fuck out of here!
- Fuck you.

7
00:02:39,739 --> 00:02:42,503
You fucking little goddamn
slippery midget.

8
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:17,998
Little midget. Little tiny people.

9
00:03:24,683 --> 00:03:27,675
Special delivery, Tattoo.

10
00:03:34,493 --> 00:03:35,960
Well, then fuck you.

11
00:03:36,128 --> 00:03:37,823
Fuck you, motherfucker.

12
00:04:01,954 --> 00:04:03,285
Lord.

13
00:05:18,831 --> 00:05:20,696
They're getting in.
I'm out of here.

14
00:05:23,869 --> 00:05:26,269
It's Geronimo time.

15
00:05:31,944 --> 00:05:34,276
Aah! Don't touch the dick.

16
00:05:34,446 --> 00:05:37,711
Get your ass back here,
Geronimo. Come on.

17
00:05:40,452 --> 00:05:43,717
We can fucking hold him off.
Get your ass back over here.

18
00:06:05,878 --> 00:06:06,902
Die!

19
00:06:07,446 --> 00:06:09,209
Bleed!

20
00:06:09,381 --> 00:06:10,905
Bleed!

21
00:06:12,718 --> 00:06:13,742
Die!

22
00:06:14,887 --> 00:06:16,252
Bleed!

23
00:06:17,690 --> 00:06:20,386
Bleed it all out,
you fucking bastard.

24
00:06:20,559 --> 00:06:22,288
Bleed it all out!

25
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:38,498
Damn,
that's some Pam Grier-type shit.

26
00:06:42,648 --> 00:06:44,275
Shit.

27
00:06:51,957 --> 00:06:54,687
Any of you limp dicks
wanna pitch in...

28
00:06:55,060 --> 00:06:56,755
...be my guest.

29
00:06:56,929 --> 00:06:58,760
Thanks for the pep talk, Hoss.

30
00:07:00,099 --> 00:07:01,532
I'm out of here.

31
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:03,964
Fucking rally the troops.

32
00:07:17,383 --> 00:07:19,044
Wait, wait. Wait!

33
00:07:21,353 --> 00:07:22,615
<i>Fuck.</i>

34
00:07:24,056 --> 00:07:27,389
Ow. Ow.

35
00:07:53,786 --> 00:07:56,519
I know a lot of you don't
believe what I believe.

36
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:57,722
But you gotta believe.

37
00:07:58,857 --> 00:08:00,620
We need to ask for help.

38
00:08:00,793 --> 00:08:02,385
We gotta believe it's coming.

39
00:08:02,561 --> 00:08:07,863
I don't know how, what shape,
what size, where,

40
00:08:08,033 --> 00:08:10,001
but we gotta believe.

41
00:08:10,536 --> 00:08:14,472
When we believe, we will receive.

42
00:08:15,774 --> 00:08:17,639
If we don't believe,

43
00:08:18,610 --> 00:08:20,305
we're already dead.

44
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:27,014
Join with me, people.

45
00:08:43,435 --> 00:08:45,164
Fuck.

46
00:09:07,226 --> 00:09:09,194
Join with me.

47
00:09:11,363 --> 00:09:12,762
Shut up.

48
00:09:12,931 --> 00:09:13,955
Join with me.

49
00:09:14,133 --> 00:09:15,862
I'm sick and tired of that shit.

50
00:09:16,034 --> 00:09:17,228
Stop it.

51
00:09:17,402 --> 00:09:19,461
Just fucking stop it.

52
00:09:19,705 --> 00:09:21,036
Stop it!

53
00:09:21,206 --> 00:09:23,800
Secrets,
we're being fucking exterminated.

54
00:09:24,143 --> 00:09:26,634
No amount of hoping,
begging or praying

55
00:09:26,812 --> 00:09:28,074
is gonna fucking fix it.

56
00:09:29,047 --> 00:09:33,313
No fucking bullshit book
of the month is gonna save us.

57
00:09:35,187 --> 00:09:37,087
We're on the fucking
chopping block here.

58
00:09:37,256 --> 00:09:39,850
It's fucking Armageddon outside.

59
00:09:40,592 --> 00:09:42,423
So wake the fuck up,
you little floozy.

60
00:09:44,797 --> 00:09:47,129
And all we got is jack and shit.

61
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:51,867
We're what's left
of what's left behind.

62
00:09:53,005 --> 00:09:55,974
And nobody's fucking
coming to save us.

63
00:10:17,095 --> 00:10:18,460
Oh, fuck.

64
00:10:24,770 --> 00:10:27,637
Shit, what the fuck is that?

65
00:10:29,107 --> 00:10:30,870
Israel.

66
00:10:31,210 --> 00:10:32,677
I told you all.

67
00:10:32,845 --> 00:10:34,813
Move your asses, dipshits.

68
00:10:55,901 --> 00:10:58,199
If you ain't living on the edge,

69
00:10:58,370 --> 00:11:00,167
you're taking up too much space.

70
00:11:00,839 --> 00:11:02,329
Shh.

71
00:11:08,413 --> 00:11:10,108
Come on. Come on. Go, go.

72
00:11:40,779 --> 00:11:42,610
Come on. Get in.

73
00:11:43,181 --> 00:11:45,479
What the fuck?

74
00:11:49,922 --> 00:11:51,549
Fuck off.

75
00:12:05,337 --> 00:12:06,895
Hold it right there.

76
00:12:07,072 --> 00:12:09,063
Who are you people?

77
00:12:09,374 --> 00:12:11,433
We're just people

78
00:12:11,610 --> 00:12:14,340
trying to save our asses, hotshot.

79
00:12:15,213 --> 00:12:16,237
Okay?

80
00:12:17,582 --> 00:12:19,413
Been waiting
all night for the cavalry.

81
00:12:20,652 --> 00:12:21,914
- You it?
- No.

82
00:12:22,788 --> 00:12:24,255
They're all dead.

83
00:12:26,625 --> 00:12:29,185
Ain't nobody else coming here?

84
00:12:29,361 --> 00:12:31,192
I've been driving all night.

85
00:12:31,363 --> 00:12:33,058
There's no Army,

86
00:12:33,231 --> 00:12:34,664
no militia,

87
00:12:34,833 --> 00:12:38,769
no soldiers and only bits
and pieces of Boy Scouts left.

88
00:12:40,238 --> 00:12:42,297
Ain't no one of substance coming.

89
00:12:44,176 --> 00:12:45,700
What the heck happened to him?

90
00:12:45,877 --> 00:12:48,345
He was fucking stupid,
that's what happened.

91
00:12:48,513 --> 00:12:52,313
There are weapons here.
This ain't a place to stay.

92
00:12:52,718 --> 00:12:54,811
I'm mounting an offensive.

93
00:12:54,987 --> 00:12:56,511
Who's game?

94
00:12:56,688 --> 00:12:57,848
Look out!

95
00:13:03,462 --> 00:13:05,692
Remember me, motherfucker, huh?

96
00:13:21,346 --> 00:13:22,973
Oh, shit.

97
00:13:23,248 --> 00:13:25,648
Y'all literally
kicked the shit out of him.

98
00:13:26,018 --> 00:13:28,282
He's a piece of shit.

99
00:13:28,453 --> 00:13:30,353
He's been holed up in here,

100
00:13:30,522 --> 00:13:32,456
wouldn't let anyone in.

101
00:13:33,125 --> 00:13:34,717
Just watched them die.

102
00:13:34,893 --> 00:13:37,020
You didn't say the magic word.

103
00:13:41,099 --> 00:13:42,589
Where's your nephew, huh?

104
00:13:42,768 --> 00:13:44,861
I haven't seen him
since the invasion.

105
00:13:45,037 --> 00:13:47,437
He is out there,
where the fuck is he?

106
00:13:47,606 --> 00:13:49,437
- Where is he?
- I ain't seen him.

107
00:13:49,608 --> 00:13:52,008
- I ain't seen him. I swear.
- Asshole!

108
00:13:52,177 --> 00:13:54,975
I swear, I ain't seen him. I swear.

109
00:14:02,587 --> 00:14:04,885
What's all this offensive shit,
partner?

110
00:14:05,657 --> 00:14:08,091
I'm taking the fight to them.

111
00:14:08,260 --> 00:14:12,060
I heard all that shit in the war
and I gotta tell you, cowboy,

112
00:14:12,364 --> 00:14:14,832
it never turned out well.

113
00:14:16,201 --> 00:14:20,262
I'm talking about a good
old-fashioned street fight, old-timer.

114
00:14:20,439 --> 00:14:23,897
They'll keep coming till we
figure out how to stomp them down.

115
00:14:32,951 --> 00:14:34,782
Hell, we're not safe out here.

116
00:14:35,787 --> 00:14:37,812
Let's get back to the cell.

117
00:14:37,989 --> 00:14:39,479
Come on.

118
00:15:00,912 --> 00:15:02,880
How are you gonna do that?

119
00:15:03,515 --> 00:15:05,483
Stomp them out.

120
00:15:06,251 --> 00:15:09,152
Well, with sweat, firepower and...

121
00:15:10,422 --> 00:15:13,323
And a little something
called courage.

122
00:15:14,426 --> 00:15:17,020
You people wanna wait here
and die?

123
00:15:17,462 --> 00:15:20,488
Or you wanna take the fight
to these devil dogs?

124
00:15:21,133 --> 00:15:22,600
Yeah.

125
00:15:22,801 --> 00:15:26,168
Yeah, we should fight,
shouldn't we?

126
00:15:26,338 --> 00:15:29,501
As soon as we find
the keys for that gun cabinet,

127
00:15:30,642 --> 00:15:32,303
grab some guns,

128
00:15:32,811 --> 00:15:34,676
throw your chambers
in your pockets.

129
00:15:35,313 --> 00:15:38,646
We'll have enough "fuck you" in this
place to really hurt some feelings.

130
00:15:45,790 --> 00:15:47,519
I knew you'd come.

131
00:15:48,326 --> 00:15:50,487
I knew you'd save us.

132
00:15:54,366 --> 00:15:57,028
Well, I'll do my best.

133
00:15:57,202 --> 00:15:58,567
How are we gonna fight?

134
00:15:58,737 --> 00:16:01,501
I mean, your fucking truck, man,
it's a piece of shit.

135
00:16:02,941 --> 00:16:05,501
Gotta be some other vehicles
nearby.

136
00:16:12,751 --> 00:16:14,378
Keys?

137
00:16:16,655 --> 00:16:18,145
- They're in the safe.
Shut up.

138
00:16:18,323 --> 00:16:20,291
I know the combination.
- Fuck you, Greg.

139
00:16:20,458 --> 00:16:22,221
You take my wife,
now you want my cars?

140
00:16:22,394 --> 00:16:24,328
This is my livelihood.

141
00:16:25,230 --> 00:16:27,289
It's for

142
00:16:27,465 --> 00:16:29,262
the greater good, so...

143
00:16:29,434 --> 00:16:31,334
- Listen to the man.
- Oh, yeah.

144
00:16:31,503 --> 00:16:33,994
- I do not like him.
Shut up, buddy.

145
00:16:34,739 --> 00:16:36,536
He's the one.

146
00:16:37,042 --> 00:16:38,976
You believe.

147
00:16:39,511 --> 00:16:40,876
GREG:

148
00:16:41,046 --> 00:16:43,310
Greg, roughly around the time
you fed a baby

149
00:16:43,481 --> 00:16:45,073
to those things out there,

150
00:16:45,250 --> 00:16:47,115
the magic between us disappeared,
okay?

151
00:16:51,122 --> 00:16:52,919
We're taking a break.

152
00:17:00,732 --> 00:17:02,666
How does that feel?

153
00:17:11,610 --> 00:17:14,078
We break into four groups of two.

154
00:17:14,246 --> 00:17:16,237
If we're separated,
they can't bunch up.

155
00:17:16,414 --> 00:17:19,611
Our chances for survival
increase dramatically.

156
00:17:19,851 --> 00:17:23,252
You two, Rent-a-Wreck and Jor-El,
we're alpha team.

157
00:17:24,189 --> 00:17:25,315
We're drawing them out.

158
00:17:25,790 --> 00:17:29,055
We form a triangle, guard each other's
backs and protect the women.

159
00:17:30,428 --> 00:17:32,419
And once we've breached
that front door,

160
00:17:32,597 --> 00:17:33,723
follow us out.

161
00:17:33,898 --> 00:17:35,388
Stay in your groups,

162
00:17:35,567 --> 00:17:36,659
head for that car lot.

163
00:17:39,070 --> 00:17:41,732
You. You must make it.

164
00:17:41,906 --> 00:17:44,306
Get those keys fast.
Those things will be coming.

165
00:17:44,476 --> 00:17:45,670
What about me?

166
00:17:46,811 --> 00:17:49,439
- You're staying, shitpants.
I'll have no more of that.

167
00:17:49,614 --> 00:17:51,775
Nobody's left behind,
everybody's coming.

168
00:17:51,950 --> 00:17:55,044
Fuck that. He's half brain-dead.
It doesn't matter, you hear?

169
00:17:55,854 --> 00:17:57,287
The rest of you hear me?

170
00:17:59,324 --> 00:18:01,292
No one is left behind.

171
00:18:01,459 --> 00:18:03,393
Now, share the credo.

172
00:18:23,581 --> 00:18:25,879
You ever used one of these before?

173
00:18:31,556 --> 00:18:34,719
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hold on. Let me show you.

174
00:18:39,631 --> 00:18:43,226
Now, you take Mr. Bullet here

175
00:18:43,868 --> 00:18:45,699
and you load him

176
00:18:45,970 --> 00:18:47,369
right...

177
00:18:48,006 --> 00:18:50,338
Right into the chamber there.

178
00:18:51,776 --> 00:18:54,973
And you cock the trigger,
all right?

179
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:58,246
Take your time when you aim.

180
00:19:01,353 --> 00:19:04,754
All right, now.
You gently squeeze the trigger.

181
00:19:06,491 --> 00:19:08,015
Hammer hits the pin,

182
00:19:08,193 --> 00:19:09,922
there's an explosion,

183
00:19:10,095 --> 00:19:12,723
and Mr. Bullet
travels down the barrel.

184
00:19:12,897 --> 00:19:14,592
He pops out.

185
00:19:16,701 --> 00:19:18,498
And if your aim is true...

186
00:19:19,070 --> 00:19:20,731
Whew...

187
00:19:27,412 --> 00:19:29,710
You gonna be able to handle that,
little lady?

188
00:19:29,881 --> 00:19:32,042
Oh, I can handle it.

189
00:19:32,250 --> 00:19:33,979
All right.

190
00:19:34,619 --> 00:19:36,553
I like what I see.

191
00:19:45,430 --> 00:19:46,863
What the fuck?

192
00:19:55,140 --> 00:19:57,700
It was just an accident.
It just went off.

193
00:19:58,476 --> 00:20:00,068
It just went off.

194
00:20:00,912 --> 00:20:01,970
Way to go.

195
00:20:07,886 --> 00:20:09,353
Oh, shit.

196
00:20:10,221 --> 00:20:12,416
Go in the cell. Go in the cell.
Get in the cell.

197
00:20:14,092 --> 00:20:15,650
This way, killer.

198
00:20:15,927 --> 00:20:18,691
Oh, Jesus.
Come on.

199
00:20:24,269 --> 00:20:27,102
So, what the fuck do we do now?

200
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:30,801
- We gotta get the guns.
- We don't have a key.

201
00:20:30,975 --> 00:20:32,602
Nobody asked me.

202
00:20:34,379 --> 00:20:37,246
So who's going, then, huh?

203
00:20:37,415 --> 00:20:39,975
Because I sure as shit ain't going.
Fuck that.

204
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:46,422
- All right, go. Go.
- This is really some fucked-up shit.

205
00:20:46,591 --> 00:20:48,752
This is fucked up.
You know this is fucked up.

206
00:20:48,927 --> 00:20:52,624
This is the part where the brother
usually dies. Listen.

207
00:20:53,331 --> 00:20:55,697
If you hear anything, pull me back.

208
00:20:55,867 --> 00:20:59,030
Fuck. I can't stand that bitch.

209
00:21:22,260 --> 00:21:24,592
Okay, okay, okay.

210
00:21:28,366 --> 00:21:30,061
Okay, okay.

211
00:22:14,512 --> 00:22:16,412
This is really fucked up.

212
00:22:28,092 --> 00:22:30,356
- Oh, shit.
- Did you hear something?

213
00:22:39,137 --> 00:22:40,627
What was that?

214
00:22:50,815 --> 00:22:51,975
- Wait, wait.
Pull.

215
00:22:52,150 --> 00:22:55,051
- Jesus.
- Pull. Pull. Pull. Pull him in.

216
00:22:56,821 --> 00:22:58,812
Oh, Jesus!
Stay down!

217
00:22:59,857 --> 00:23:01,984
Stand up.
Fuck.

218
00:23:02,794 --> 00:23:04,421
Pull!

219
00:23:19,510 --> 00:23:23,105
What the fuck!
- You fucking asshole!

220
00:23:31,155 --> 00:23:32,622
GREG:

221
00:23:34,692 --> 00:23:36,023
Oh, shit.

222
00:23:36,194 --> 00:23:37,786
Shit.

223
00:23:44,435 --> 00:23:46,130
What the fuck is that sound?

224
00:23:46,304 --> 00:23:49,432
It's a goddamn monster alarm.

225
00:23:52,844 --> 00:23:54,141
It's drawing them away.

226
00:23:54,979 --> 00:23:56,879
They're chasing the fucking sound.

227
00:24:00,118 --> 00:24:02,518
What the fuck happened
with the guns?

228
00:24:02,687 --> 00:24:04,746
- Where are the keys?
- Fuck if I know.

229
00:24:04,922 --> 00:24:07,982
Get this shit off me.
Get me out of this fucking thing.

230
00:24:08,192 --> 00:24:10,183
Get me out of this shit.

231
00:24:24,909 --> 00:24:26,536
We gotta get out of this town.

232
00:24:43,327 --> 00:24:46,558
- Hurry. Come on, come on.
Go. Go.

233
00:24:54,005 --> 00:24:56,235
- Go.
- Ladies first.

234
00:24:56,974 --> 00:24:58,373
Go ahead.

235
00:24:58,543 --> 00:25:00,067
L... I know what you're up to.

236
00:25:00,244 --> 00:25:02,212
- I know what you're up to.
- Shut up.

237
00:25:04,082 --> 00:25:05,413
I can use a shield.

238
00:25:05,583 --> 00:25:06,709
Hey.

239
00:25:08,886 --> 00:25:11,218
Where the hell are you going,
motherfucker?

240
00:25:25,903 --> 00:25:27,666
Come on, little guy.

241
00:25:31,609 --> 00:25:33,600
LIGHTNING

242
00:25:52,430 --> 00:25:53,488
Last stop, shitbag.

243
00:26:07,879 --> 00:26:09,540
Don't taste so good.

244
00:26:29,534 --> 00:26:33,664
- Double-crossing sleazebag.
- Listen. No, no, no.

245
00:26:33,871 --> 00:26:36,499
You don't understand.
I wasn't trying to screw you.

246
00:26:36,674 --> 00:26:38,665
- Shut up. They'll hear you.
Jesus.

247
00:26:38,843 --> 00:26:40,504
God.
- Jesus.

248
00:26:43,414 --> 00:26:45,712
All right, listen.
Listen, I... I...

249
00:26:47,084 --> 00:26:49,109
Listen,
would you stop fucking hitting me?

250
00:26:49,287 --> 00:26:52,313
I'm not fucking with you.
I didn't know how to tell you this.

251
00:26:52,490 --> 00:26:53,718
I do not have enough cars.

252
00:26:53,891 --> 00:26:56,519
Be quiet! Shh!

253
00:26:56,694 --> 00:26:59,720
I don't have enough cars for
everyone, okay? But if we stay...

254
00:26:59,897 --> 00:27:02,331
Be quiet! Shut up.

255
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:05,435
Listen. Listen. No, no, no.
We can do this, okay?

256
00:27:05,603 --> 00:27:07,434
All we gotta do
is stick together, okay?

257
00:27:07,605 --> 00:27:09,539
Fuck your boss.
I can't stand that bitch.

258
00:27:09,707 --> 00:27:13,074
But you, you and me, if we stick
together, if we stick together...

259
00:27:17,215 --> 00:27:18,239
Somebody!

260
00:27:19,650 --> 00:27:21,550
Oh, no. Somebody.

261
00:27:24,622 --> 00:27:25,646
Help!

262
00:27:27,758 --> 00:27:29,385
Please, help me.

263
00:27:54,452 --> 00:27:57,353
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

264
00:28:12,637 --> 00:28:16,038
Hurry up and open the safe, pipehead,
and let's get the fuck out of here.

265
00:28:34,425 --> 00:28:35,892
Oh, God. Oh, God.

266
00:28:38,462 --> 00:28:39,895
Okay.

267
00:28:45,303 --> 00:28:46,998
Oh, yeah.

268
00:28:56,147 --> 00:28:58,411
You will remember.

269
00:29:01,619 --> 00:29:03,644
Visualize.

270
00:29:04,689 --> 00:29:06,520
Okay, okay.

271
00:29:08,659 --> 00:29:10,126
Visualize.

272
00:29:10,461 --> 00:29:11,860
Okay.

273
00:29:57,675 --> 00:29:59,233
Let's go.

274
00:30:34,879 --> 00:30:36,369
My leg!

275
00:30:56,467 --> 00:30:58,526
- What is this thing?
- This is my house.

276
00:30:58,702 --> 00:30:59,862
And you're trespassing.

277
00:31:04,175 --> 00:31:06,871
Meth lab. - We're buried.
We're safe down here.

278
00:31:08,245 --> 00:31:09,473
Safe, my ass.

279
00:31:18,722 --> 00:31:20,383
Let's get the hell out of here.

280
00:31:32,636 --> 00:31:34,729
Come on, let's go!

281
00:32:10,574 --> 00:32:12,735
Goddamn it.

282
00:32:14,712 --> 00:32:16,543
Come on,
let's get the hell out of here!

283
00:32:18,182 --> 00:32:19,479
What the fuck are you doing?

284
00:32:19,650 --> 00:32:20,912
I'm glad that still works.

285
00:32:21,085 --> 00:32:23,246
- Get out of there.
- Just a sec.

286
00:33:01,525 --> 00:33:03,049
Help!

287
00:33:17,141 --> 00:33:18,267
Die.

288
00:33:18,442 --> 00:33:20,000
Help! Help!

289
00:33:26,817 --> 00:33:28,978
Fuck you.

290
00:33:50,441 --> 00:33:52,033
Hey.

291
00:33:55,879 --> 00:33:57,710
Wait a minute. Wait!

292
00:33:58,082 --> 00:34:00,141
- Wait.
Wait for us.

293
00:34:00,317 --> 00:34:03,115
Hey. Wait. Hey.

294
00:34:08,359 --> 00:34:09,485
No!

295
00:34:09,660 --> 00:34:11,821
Hey!

296
00:35:08,452 --> 00:35:09,976
Fuck.

297
00:35:45,789 --> 00:35:49,020
Begone, foul beasts. Begone.

298
00:35:49,293 --> 00:35:52,353
Back, I say. Back, demon.

299
00:35:52,529 --> 00:35:54,258
Back.

300
00:35:54,565 --> 00:35:56,032
Get back.

301
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:58,259
Back. Back.

302
00:35:59,103 --> 00:36:00,229
Back.

303
00:36:05,743 --> 00:36:07,404
Begone.

304
00:36:11,982 --> 00:36:14,246
I did it again.

305
00:36:24,128 --> 00:36:25,652
Come out, everyone.

306
00:36:25,829 --> 00:36:27,888
Don't be afraid.

307
00:36:28,932 --> 00:36:31,730
- Who are you?
- Stand back and be amazed.

308
00:36:32,469 --> 00:36:33,595
GREG:

309
00:36:33,771 --> 00:36:36,399
Yes, I am he.

310
00:36:36,573 --> 00:36:38,370
The Prophet.

311
00:36:44,381 --> 00:36:46,975
I got the gift, faggots. Ha-ha.

312
00:36:47,584 --> 00:36:50,075
I control the monsters.

313
00:36:50,254 --> 00:36:54,247
I wish them to leave
and they leave.

314
00:36:54,792 --> 00:36:56,987
You must go underground

315
00:36:57,161 --> 00:36:58,719
through the sewers.

316
00:36:58,896 --> 00:37:00,261
The way to the big city.

317
00:37:00,431 --> 00:37:03,764
You want us to take these storm drains
all the way back to the big city?

318
00:37:04,268 --> 00:37:07,897
- Don't talk to the Prophet that way.
- Bitch, I will fuck you up.

319
00:37:08,071 --> 00:37:09,595
Hey, hey, hey, dipshit.

320
00:37:09,773 --> 00:37:14,506
Listen, this guy just
saved our asses, okay?

321
00:37:14,678 --> 00:37:17,579
If he says take the storm drain,

322
00:37:17,748 --> 00:37:19,978
we better sure as shit
take the storm drain.

323
00:37:21,251 --> 00:37:22,843
Be cool.

324
00:37:23,053 --> 00:37:24,645
Let's play this thing out.

325
00:37:24,822 --> 00:37:26,551
Come, we must act quickly.

326
00:37:26,723 --> 00:37:29,021
I'll bring up the rear.

327
00:38:37,728 --> 00:38:39,821
What the fuck was that, old man?

328
00:38:40,998 --> 00:38:44,525
Shut the fuck up,
you dimwitted cunt.

329
00:38:44,701 --> 00:38:46,464
We can slow down.

330
00:38:46,637 --> 00:38:48,935
I feel the monsters' presence
dissipating.

331
00:38:49,273 --> 00:38:52,037
You saved our ass, Moses.

332
00:38:52,209 --> 00:38:54,507
We're much obliged.

333
00:38:56,280 --> 00:38:58,407
I can't see nothing down here.

334
00:39:04,922 --> 00:39:06,412
You okay, sweetie?

335
00:39:48,699 --> 00:39:50,633
We're not alone.

336
00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:11,585
You hear that?

337
00:40:24,034 --> 00:40:26,502
- No, I hear it too.
Hold up.

338
00:40:30,874 --> 00:40:32,432
What?

339
00:40:32,809 --> 00:40:34,538
It's your head.
Coming from your head.

340
00:40:34,711 --> 00:40:39,011
- Get off me. Get off me.
- Ringing like a fucking tea kettle.

341
00:40:39,182 --> 00:40:40,376
You're gonna give us away.

342
00:40:41,351 --> 00:40:43,911
I have it turned up
so I can hear better.

343
00:40:45,288 --> 00:40:46,312
Is that better?

344
00:40:47,658 --> 00:40:48,955
Holy fucking shit.

345
00:40:51,461 --> 00:40:53,395
Oh, shit.

346
00:40:53,563 --> 00:40:54,655
They're tracking us.

347
00:40:54,831 --> 00:40:57,561
Language, please.

348
00:41:16,420 --> 00:41:18,012
Oh, boy.

349
00:41:18,188 --> 00:41:20,679
Yeah, yeah.

350
00:41:30,867 --> 00:41:32,562
Watch it.

351
00:41:36,606 --> 00:41:38,801
Which way do we go?
- I don't know.

352
00:41:38,975 --> 00:41:41,603
Ask Jesus back there.

353
00:41:42,612 --> 00:41:43,977
Hold on.

354
00:41:44,147 --> 00:41:46,445
I gotta feel this one.

355
00:41:48,685 --> 00:41:50,653
We're clear.

356
00:41:53,423 --> 00:41:54,685
Come on, let's go.

357
00:41:54,858 --> 00:41:56,052
Get out of my way.

358
00:41:56,226 --> 00:41:57,716
What?
- Get out of my way.

359
00:42:12,375 --> 00:42:14,240
Slide under. Go.

360
00:42:14,578 --> 00:42:16,102
I got it.

361
00:42:30,093 --> 00:42:32,084
Fuck. This is heavy.

362
00:42:35,232 --> 00:42:37,097
Wait, wait, wait.

363
00:42:38,869 --> 00:42:40,097
The Puker!

364
00:42:42,139 --> 00:42:44,573
Blood makes it feel good.

365
00:43:08,632 --> 00:43:11,032
Help her, goddamn it! Help her!

366
00:43:27,684 --> 00:43:29,345
Get off her, motherfucker!

367
00:43:29,519 --> 00:43:30,645
LIGHTNING:

368
00:43:53,944 --> 00:43:55,844
No!

369
00:44:13,997 --> 00:44:16,056
Those motherfuckers are dead!

370
00:44:16,233 --> 00:44:18,064
Oh, yeah!

371
00:44:18,235 --> 00:44:20,032
Who are you?

372
00:44:23,306 --> 00:44:25,001
A few days ago,

373
00:44:25,175 --> 00:44:26,608
I was my parents' son.

374
00:44:28,645 --> 00:44:30,010
Two days ago,

375
00:44:30,580 --> 00:44:32,571
I was just another victim.

376
00:44:32,749 --> 00:44:34,216
Yesterday,

377
00:44:34,384 --> 00:44:35,942
I was born again.

378
00:44:37,520 --> 00:44:39,385
And today,

379
00:44:43,493 --> 00:44:45,051
I'm a wasteland warrior.

380
00:44:51,568 --> 00:44:53,365
How can I die

381
00:44:53,536 --> 00:44:55,970
when I'm a registered
lethal weapon?

382
00:44:59,843 --> 00:45:01,037
Badass motherfucker.

383
00:45:01,845 --> 00:45:02,869
Karate.

384
00:45:03,346 --> 00:45:05,473
Way to go, Merlin.

385
00:45:11,721 --> 00:45:14,155
My gift only works on monsters.

386
00:45:14,324 --> 00:45:15,348
Sure it does.

387
00:45:15,525 --> 00:45:18,050
Well, maybe if you hadn't have
had me turn down my ears,

388
00:45:18,228 --> 00:45:19,855
I could have at least heard them.

389
00:45:20,030 --> 00:45:22,498
I've been tracking you guys
for a little while.

390
00:45:23,133 --> 00:45:25,124
I had to make sure
you weren't infected.

391
00:45:31,074 --> 00:45:32,735
I'm sorry for your loss.

392
00:45:32,909 --> 00:45:35,002
She looked to be quite the fighter.

393
00:45:35,178 --> 00:45:38,170
Save your sorry for someone else,
macho.

394
00:45:39,616 --> 00:45:42,744
We're looking for the right way to go.
Will you help us?

395
00:45:43,954 --> 00:45:45,945
Well, there's too many of us
to run topside.

396
00:45:46,122 --> 00:45:48,613
They're picking off survivors
left and right.

397
00:45:55,932 --> 00:45:59,390
It's not for that.
I've been using it to see.

398
00:46:00,370 --> 00:46:02,304
Baking soda, peroxide and pop.

399
00:46:08,378 --> 00:46:10,437
That manhole up there,

400
00:46:10,613 --> 00:46:12,979
we ought to close it.

401
00:46:13,149 --> 00:46:14,980
We don't want nobody
coming down here.

402
00:46:15,151 --> 00:46:16,311
Good thinking.

403
00:46:16,619 --> 00:46:18,849
- Yeah.
- I got it, Pops.

404
00:47:01,631 --> 00:47:02,893
You must be a military man.

405
00:47:03,066 --> 00:47:04,863
Oh, yeah. Marines?

406
00:47:05,035 --> 00:47:06,525
Yup.

407
00:47:06,703 --> 00:47:08,534
Intuition like that

408
00:47:08,705 --> 00:47:11,333
only comes from battle experience.

409
00:47:33,029 --> 00:47:34,360
Fuck, man!

410
00:47:34,531 --> 00:47:36,863
Get up. Lift him up.

411
00:47:40,270 --> 00:47:41,862
Hey.

412
00:47:53,650 --> 00:47:56,585
Back, demon.
Foul beast, I command you.

413
00:47:59,722 --> 00:48:01,952
Back. Back, I say.

414
00:48:04,294 --> 00:48:06,319
Back. Back.

415
00:48:27,317 --> 00:48:28,716
Let's go, man.

416
00:48:28,885 --> 00:48:31,479
We'll catch up
with your little friends.

417
00:48:47,770 --> 00:48:49,397
What was that?

418
00:48:50,073 --> 00:48:53,770
I don't reckon we're alone here,
partner.

419
00:48:55,411 --> 00:48:58,039
You in any shape to fight, son?

420
00:48:59,315 --> 00:49:00,714
I just got my arm bitten off.

421
00:49:00,884 --> 00:49:02,875
Yeah, well,

422
00:49:03,052 --> 00:49:04,280
you better walk it off.

423
00:49:04,454 --> 00:49:08,447
Because one of them suckers
are in here with us right now.

424
00:49:21,171 --> 00:49:23,162
Come on, motherfucker!

425
00:49:33,116 --> 00:49:35,016
I'm not gonna make it.

426
00:49:39,022 --> 00:49:41,616
You gotta keep fighting, son.

427
00:49:44,160 --> 00:49:45,787
I'm with you.

428
00:50:37,280 --> 00:50:38,747
Look.

429
00:51:18,755 --> 00:51:19,983
Oh...

430
00:51:20,156 --> 00:51:22,181
Ow, that really hurt.

431
00:51:41,411 --> 00:51:42,435
Fuck.

432
00:51:42,612 --> 00:51:44,239
Oh, man.

433
00:51:50,520 --> 00:51:52,545
Piece of shit.

434
00:52:04,567 --> 00:52:05,795
What?

435
00:52:07,870 --> 00:52:10,395
Oh, fuck!

436
00:52:15,011 --> 00:52:17,411
Take it easy. Come on, take it easy.
You're okay.

437
00:52:17,747 --> 00:52:19,772
Yeah, speak for yourself.

438
00:52:21,084 --> 00:52:23,985
- Shit.
We gotta stop that bleeding.

439
00:52:24,287 --> 00:52:26,482
It's too fucking dark in here.
I can't see.

440
00:52:26,656 --> 00:52:29,318
Lean over, lean over.
I got an idea.

441
00:52:34,063 --> 00:52:36,463
You ain't a smart hombre.

442
00:52:38,034 --> 00:52:39,899
This is going to sting.

443
00:52:40,069 --> 00:52:41,093
Just a little bit.

444
00:52:43,906 --> 00:52:45,897
Mother of Mary. God.

445
00:52:46,075 --> 00:52:49,044
I got a bullet from
a hunting trip here, son.

446
00:52:49,212 --> 00:52:51,339
You're not doing
what I think you're doing.

447
00:52:51,514 --> 00:52:53,846
Well, we gotta close that wound,
son.

448
00:53:04,827 --> 00:53:06,795
Somehow we gotta
pour it in deep here.

449
00:53:07,764 --> 00:53:09,391
Real deep.

450
00:53:14,904 --> 00:53:16,337
That's a lot, dude.

451
00:53:16,506 --> 00:53:18,974
Hey, listen,
this is battlefield surgery, son.

452
00:53:19,142 --> 00:53:20,507
It's very delicate.

453
00:53:20,676 --> 00:53:23,577
I mean, you're the fucking patient,
I'm the goddamn doctor.

454
00:53:23,746 --> 00:53:26,715
Just let me do my fucking thing,
will you?

455
00:53:26,883 --> 00:53:28,783
One more, that's all.

456
00:53:30,620 --> 00:53:31,985
All right, now,

457
00:53:32,455 --> 00:53:34,423
I need a match.
I got one, I got one.

458
00:53:36,292 --> 00:53:38,817
- Did you learn this in the Marines?
- No.

459
00:53:38,995 --> 00:53:40,428
<i>- Rambo III.
- What?</i>

460
00:53:43,866 --> 00:53:45,299
Oh, my God!

461
00:53:45,468 --> 00:53:47,163
Oh, fuck!

462
00:53:47,570 --> 00:53:49,333
Whoa, what the fuck?

463
00:53:50,273 --> 00:53:51,763
What the fuck?

464
00:54:24,740 --> 00:54:26,708
GREG:

465
00:54:27,577 --> 00:54:29,545
LIGHTNING:

466
00:54:31,447 --> 00:54:32,914
GREG, THEN LIGHTNING:

467
00:54:35,117 --> 00:54:38,951
GREG, THEN LIGHTNING:

468
00:54:51,634 --> 00:54:53,226
Greg, he's not a baby.

469
00:54:54,103 --> 00:54:55,764
LIGHTNING:

470
00:55:00,309 --> 00:55:01,367
He's not the baby.

471
00:55:11,854 --> 00:55:14,015
GREG, THEN LIGHTNING:

472
00:55:14,190 --> 00:55:16,249
LIGHTNING:

473
00:55:16,425 --> 00:55:18,518
GREG:

474
00:55:18,694 --> 00:55:21,026
LIGHTNING:

475
00:55:21,197 --> 00:55:23,791
GREG, THEN LIGHTNING:

476
00:55:24,033 --> 00:55:25,261
Greg, stop it.

477
00:55:25,434 --> 00:55:26,992
LIGHTNING:

478
00:55:38,648 --> 00:55:40,138
LIGHTNING:

479
00:56:15,718 --> 00:56:18,448
We gotta keep moving, son.

480
00:56:21,924 --> 00:56:25,018
I look like a goddamn
foosball player.

481
00:56:32,868 --> 00:56:36,497
I know it looks bad right now, son.

482
00:56:36,672 --> 00:56:39,903
Yeah, it looks real bad, all right?

483
00:56:40,076 --> 00:56:42,806
Why don't you just chew off
my dick?

484
00:56:42,979 --> 00:56:44,844
We'll call it a day.

485
00:56:51,520 --> 00:56:52,953
Look,

486
00:56:53,255 --> 00:56:55,485
you keep fighting until the end.

487
00:56:55,658 --> 00:56:59,424
You suck it up and you fight.

488
00:57:17,847 --> 00:57:20,372
Stay with me, fuckers.

489
00:57:20,816 --> 00:57:23,216
Who knows what the fuck
is out there.

490
00:57:30,960 --> 00:57:33,190
I like your skin.

491
00:57:33,362 --> 00:57:35,387
So soft.

492
00:57:35,564 --> 00:57:37,862
- So colorful.
Get back!

493
00:57:38,034 --> 00:57:40,594
- I like it.
- Get fucking back!

494
00:57:40,770 --> 00:57:42,567
Can I touch it?

495
00:57:42,738 --> 00:57:45,798
I will fucking break
your fucking cunt head!

496
00:57:45,975 --> 00:57:48,034
- I wanna touch it.
- Get back!

497
00:57:55,718 --> 00:57:58,118
There's your power.

498
00:57:58,921 --> 00:58:01,321
There's your power.

499
00:58:08,397 --> 00:58:09,421
You hear that?

500
00:58:10,566 --> 00:58:11,863
What...?

501
00:58:12,034 --> 00:58:14,002
What are you doing?

502
00:58:14,670 --> 00:58:18,333
We go in hard, we go in fast,
we'll kill them all.

503
00:58:18,507 --> 00:58:20,407
What? How?

504
00:58:20,576 --> 00:58:22,203
I don't have any arms.

505
00:58:22,378 --> 00:58:25,279
You only need legs to kick ass,
baby boy.

506
00:58:25,448 --> 00:58:28,349
- Kill them fucking baboons.
- Shit.

507
00:58:44,934 --> 00:58:47,266
All right, come on, baby, come on.

508
00:58:48,037 --> 00:58:50,028
Yeah!

509
00:59:27,943 --> 00:59:30,173
That's how you gut a bitch, bitch.

510
00:59:41,090 --> 00:59:43,251
Back, demon. Back, I say.

511
00:59:43,425 --> 00:59:44,653
That's right, demon.

512
01:00:04,413 --> 01:00:05,744
GREG:

513
01:00:56,131 --> 01:00:58,656
I said jump high, baby boy.

514
01:00:58,934 --> 01:01:00,026
Now!

515
01:01:10,246 --> 01:01:11,804
Goddamn freaks!

516
01:01:16,252 --> 01:01:18,686
You shithead. Come on.

517
01:01:18,854 --> 01:01:20,651
Let's get out of here.

518
01:01:22,858 --> 01:01:24,587
Come on. They're coming. This way.

519
01:01:24,760 --> 01:01:27,627
Come on.
Check your ass, baby boy.

520
01:01:27,796 --> 01:01:29,696
They're coming.

521
01:01:30,633 --> 01:01:33,864
Go to the ladder. The ladder.

522
01:01:34,803 --> 01:01:36,168
Come on.

523
01:01:36,672 --> 01:01:39,869
Come on,
get up the goddamn ladder.

524
01:01:42,278 --> 01:01:43,836
All right.

525
01:01:44,179 --> 01:01:45,737
Fucking shit.

526
01:01:45,915 --> 01:01:47,177
What do we do?

527
01:01:47,349 --> 01:01:48,782
What the fuck do we do?

528
01:01:48,951 --> 01:01:51,784
Come on, come on,
come on. On my back.

529
01:01:51,954 --> 01:01:54,923
Let's go, jump on. Get up there.

530
01:02:02,298 --> 01:02:03,424
Come on, get up.

531
01:02:16,045 --> 01:02:17,706
You guys wait here.

532
01:02:22,351 --> 01:02:24,512
I'm fucked.

533
01:02:26,655 --> 01:02:28,316
You can make it.

534
01:02:28,691 --> 01:02:30,283
You can.

535
01:02:37,366 --> 01:02:38,993
Get up there.

536
01:02:42,137 --> 01:02:43,866
Give me your hand.

537
01:02:44,306 --> 01:02:47,366
Give me your hand.
Come on, you can make it.

538
01:02:57,920 --> 01:02:59,717
Help. Help me, woman.

539
01:02:59,888 --> 01:03:01,549
Help me.

540
01:03:01,724 --> 01:03:03,021
Up.

541
01:03:03,192 --> 01:03:04,523
Up.

542
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:12,228
Give me your hand.

543
01:03:12,401 --> 01:03:14,392
Come on, give me your hand.

544
01:03:58,113 --> 01:04:00,206
Oh, my God.

545
01:04:40,055 --> 01:04:41,989
Dead end.

546
01:04:42,424 --> 01:04:44,392
What the fuck do we do now?

547
01:04:46,595 --> 01:04:48,153
Open it.

548
01:04:48,530 --> 01:04:49,554
Open it.

549
01:05:05,714 --> 01:05:07,875
Oh, shit.

550
01:05:14,423 --> 01:05:15,856
GREG:

551
01:05:20,329 --> 01:05:21,421
I got this.

552
01:05:21,597 --> 01:05:23,827
I'm about to dazzle
the shit out of you.

553
01:05:25,200 --> 01:05:27,498
Back, demon. Back, I say.

554
01:05:27,970 --> 01:05:30,131
That's right, demon. Back. Back.

555
01:05:32,007 --> 01:05:34,134
- Oh, shit.
- Get back, demon.

556
01:05:36,311 --> 01:05:37,903
Back.

557
01:05:38,147 --> 01:05:40,274
Feel my power. Back.

558
01:05:40,449 --> 01:05:42,383
Oh, you dumb shit.

559
01:05:42,551 --> 01:05:45,520
It's your hearing aid
that's keeping him back, not you.

560
01:05:45,687 --> 01:05:47,279
What?

561
01:05:47,923 --> 01:05:49,151
Oh, shit!

562
01:05:52,027 --> 01:05:54,018
Lift it. Lift it.

563
01:06:04,806 --> 01:06:05,830
LIGHTNING:

564
01:06:18,820 --> 01:06:21,152
I'm stuck.
The pipe is stuck.

565
01:06:22,925 --> 01:06:24,017
Pull it.

566
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:33,266
The pipe, pull it through.

567
01:06:33,401 --> 01:06:34,533
The pipe, pull it through.

568
01:06:48,550 --> 01:06:50,415
Slasher?

569
01:06:55,424 --> 01:06:57,449
Oh, no.

570
01:07:02,030 --> 01:07:03,463
No!

571
01:07:59,187 --> 01:08:01,280
That's it.

572
01:08:15,604 --> 01:08:16,628
Come on back.

573
01:09:21,269 --> 01:09:24,067
Fucking dirt bike.

574
01:09:59,174 --> 01:10:00,300
I'm already dead.

575
01:10:00,475 --> 01:10:02,375
You won't get far.

576
01:10:02,544 --> 01:10:04,808
I'll take him away as far as I can.

577
01:10:16,825 --> 01:10:18,087
<i>Thank you.</i>

578
01:11:02,437 --> 01:11:04,098
Shit.

579
01:11:04,573 --> 01:11:06,939
We're the only ones left.

580
01:11:07,509 --> 01:11:10,137
The world has gone to hell.

581
01:11:10,779 --> 01:11:12,440
We have to...

582
01:11:12,614 --> 01:11:13,672
We gotta do something.

583
01:11:14,149 --> 01:11:15,810
I'll tell you what we gotta do.

584
01:11:16,418 --> 01:11:19,979
We gotta repopulate the Earth,
that's what we gotta do.

585
01:11:20,155 --> 01:11:21,213
We gotta start fucking.

586
01:11:22,457 --> 01:11:23,515
Right now.

587
01:16:36,004 --> 01:16:38,131
Goddamn it.
