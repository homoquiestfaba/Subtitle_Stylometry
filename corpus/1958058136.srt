1
00:01:18,580 --> 00:01:20,615
Sure we're good
to, uh, walk through here?

2
00:01:20,748 --> 00:01:22,550
Yeah, man,
I do it all the time.

3
00:01:22,917 --> 00:01:23,985
You got your mask?

4
00:01:24,652 --> 00:01:26,420
What do you call this,
Mr. Camp Counselor?

5
00:01:26,955 --> 00:01:28,756
Uh, I don't know
what you call it in LA.

6
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:30,825
But where I'm from,
that's not a mask.

7
00:01:30,959 --> 00:01:32,326
We're from the same...

8
00:01:32,727 --> 00:01:36,064
Low-key, is it, uh,
White Claw o'clock already, or?

9
00:01:36,196 --> 00:01:37,599
I mean,
did you pack any beers

10
00:01:37,732 --> 00:01:39,867
or did you just pack
your beloved seltzers?

11
00:01:40,001 --> 00:01:42,503
I packed your, uh,
old man beer, whatever it is.

12
00:01:42,637 --> 00:01:44,271
- Lagunitas.
- Yeah.

13
00:01:44,404 --> 00:01:45,974
You know
they're local, right?

14
00:01:46,106 --> 00:01:47,775
Uh, you know
they're local, right?

15
00:01:48,943 --> 00:01:50,377
Well,
when we send off Mom,

16
00:01:50,511 --> 00:01:51,980
I thought
it'd be a good idea to

17
00:01:52,112 --> 00:01:53,581
do a little cheers,
you know?

18
00:01:53,715 --> 00:01:56,517
Bet. Bet.
That'd be pretty lit, honestly.

19
00:01:57,919 --> 00:01:59,921
I'mma
take a piss real quick.

20
00:02:00,054 --> 00:02:01,388
You cool?
Be right back.

21
00:02:01,522 --> 00:02:02,790
Do your thing.

22
00:02:05,693 --> 00:02:06,961
Perfect timing.

23
00:02:07,095 --> 00:02:10,565
Let's see. Let's see.
The lighting is, uh...

24
00:02:11,398 --> 00:02:12,466
not ideal.

25
00:02:12,867 --> 00:02:14,535
Nobody cares
about the quality anyway.

26
00:02:14,669 --> 00:02:17,005
They just want to see
the hair.

27
00:02:17,137 --> 00:02:18,472
It looks bright and tight.

28
00:02:18,606 --> 00:02:21,676
We doin' it, we doin' it, Jonas.
Let's go.

29
00:02:21,809 --> 00:02:24,612
<i>Hey, guys,</i>
<i>it's your boy, Jonas.</i>

30
00:02:24,746 --> 00:02:26,547
<i>Jonas with the Mostest</i>
<i>coming at you</i>

31
00:02:26,681 --> 00:02:29,851
<i>from my old hometown</i>
<i>of Sonoma, California,</i>

32
00:02:29,984 --> 00:02:32,553
<i>or as I like</i>
<i>to call it, Slownoma.</i>

33
00:02:32,687 --> 00:02:36,758
<i>You know, we out here,</i>
<i>it's twenty-twenty... one.</i>

34
00:02:36,891 --> 00:02:39,493
<i>We out here doing new things,</i>
<i>but also doing old things.</i>

35
00:02:39,627 --> 00:02:42,429
<i>Coming back to hometowns,</i>
<i>vintage visits.</i>

36
00:02:42,563 --> 00:02:44,498
<i>We doing it right,</i>
<i>and we doing it tight.</i>

37
00:02:44,632 --> 00:02:46,266
<i>You know how it works.</i>

38
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:49,871
<i>But sadly...</i>

39
00:02:50,004 --> 00:02:52,406
<i>I'm here</i>
<i>on some not so great news.</i>

40
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:54,609
<i>You see, my mother...</i>

41
00:02:57,545 --> 00:02:58,946
<i>...my mother</i>
<i>has passed on.</i>

42
00:03:00,114 --> 00:03:01,415
<i>But luckily,</i>

43
00:03:02,215 --> 00:03:03,718
<i>because of DTF Eyewear,</i>

44
00:03:03,851 --> 00:03:06,688
<i>I got these new shades</i>
<i>to hide the tears.</i>

45
00:03:06,821 --> 00:03:09,957
<i>But this is a very</i>
<i>tender moment for me,</i>

46
00:03:10,992 --> 00:03:12,259
<i>for my family.</i>

47
00:03:12,392 --> 00:03:13,728
<i>So we're gonna</i>
<i>go up to a lake</i>

48
00:03:13,861 --> 00:03:16,463
<i>and we're gonna</i>
<i>spread her ashes.</i>

49
00:03:16,597 --> 00:03:18,833
<i>Spread her ashes.</i>
<i>Spread-- spread her ashes.</i>

50
00:03:18,966 --> 00:03:20,400
Is it spread or scatter?

51
00:03:20,535 --> 00:03:23,671
Spread-- spread her ash--
Scatter her ashes.

52
00:03:23,805 --> 00:03:25,439
- We're gonna scatter her ashes.
- Yo. Hey.

53
00:03:25,573 --> 00:03:26,674
That's what
we're gonna do.

54
00:03:26,808 --> 00:03:28,241
We're gonna
spread her ashes

55
00:03:28,375 --> 00:03:29,610
and you're gonna
bring the drama, Jonas.

56
00:03:29,744 --> 00:03:31,179
You're gonna
bring it this time,

57
00:03:31,311 --> 00:03:32,412
because you need to
melt hearts.

58
00:03:32,547 --> 00:03:33,681
You need to
make tears fall.

59
00:03:33,815 --> 00:03:35,149
You're gonna
do this right,

60
00:03:35,282 --> 00:03:36,216
and you're gonna
do this tight,

61
00:03:36,349 --> 00:03:37,618
because you're Jonas.

62
00:03:37,752 --> 00:03:39,020
You are Jonas
with the Mostest.

63
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:41,122
You got this.
Okay, let's do this.

64
00:03:42,623 --> 00:03:45,126
Hey, guys,
it's your boy, Jonas.

65
00:03:45,258 --> 00:03:47,729
Jonas with the Mostest
out here.

66
00:03:48,096 --> 00:03:49,997
I got to say, man,
if you're gonna keep doing

67
00:03:50,131 --> 00:03:53,501
these, like,
Instagram videos and TikTak--

68
00:03:53,868 --> 00:03:55,536
- TikTok.
- videos-- What?

69
00:03:56,236 --> 00:03:58,039
- It's TikTok.
- Yeah, whatever.

70
00:03:58,172 --> 00:04:00,373
I'm just saying, man,
like, maybe you should add

71
00:04:00,508 --> 00:04:02,043
some production value
to it, you know?

72
00:04:02,176 --> 00:04:04,178
Like, flip the camera
horizontal instead of vertical.

73
00:04:04,311 --> 00:04:06,748
Or you ever seen the beginning
of <i>Double Indemnity</i>

74
00:04:06,881 --> 00:04:08,783
when he confesses
at the-- at the very top?

75
00:04:08,916 --> 00:04:10,985
Like, if you did
something like that,

76
00:04:11,119 --> 00:04:12,385
I'd watch that
for sure.

77
00:04:13,154 --> 00:04:15,022
El, you're gonna have to
help me out a little bit.

78
00:04:15,156 --> 00:04:16,557
- Hmm.
- What's <i>Double indemnity?</i>

79
00:04:16,691 --> 00:04:18,726
Is it like a web series,
game show?

80
00:04:18,860 --> 00:04:20,427
Like, <i>Double Jeopardy</i>
or something?

81
00:04:20,561 --> 00:04:22,697
You've never seen
<i>Double Indemnity?</i>

82
00:04:22,830 --> 00:04:25,499
Mr. Hollywood's never seen
<i>Double Indemnity?</i>

83
00:04:25,633 --> 00:04:27,300
-Who's in it?
-Oh, man.

84
00:04:27,434 --> 00:04:29,504
Fred McMurray,
Barbara Stanwick.

85
00:04:29,904 --> 00:04:31,338
Oh, man,
but Edward G. Robinson,

86
00:04:31,471 --> 00:04:33,306
he steals the show,
I'm serious.

87
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:34,542
Ellie, I think
you're making up

88
00:04:34,675 --> 00:04:35,910
all of those names.

89
00:04:36,043 --> 00:04:37,645
Is it old?

90
00:04:37,779 --> 00:04:39,013
No, man,
it's a classic.

91
00:04:39,147 --> 00:04:40,548
Well, yeah, it's old,

92
00:04:40,681 --> 00:04:42,717
but I even have the criterion,
it's remastered.

93
00:04:42,850 --> 00:04:44,417
Cool, cool, cool,
but, like,

94
00:04:44,552 --> 00:04:45,953
you didn't really
answer my question.

95
00:04:46,087 --> 00:04:48,388
Like, how old are we talking?
Like '80s old?

96
00:04:48,523 --> 00:04:51,058
Is that what you think old is?
The '80s?

97
00:04:51,659 --> 00:04:53,194
Ellie, when was it made?

98
00:04:53,761 --> 00:04:56,697
I don't know.
Well, 1942, actually.

99
00:04:56,831 --> 00:04:57,899
Wait.

100
00:04:58,566 --> 00:05:01,068
No, 1944, that's it.

101
00:05:01,803 --> 00:05:03,237
Do you ever watch
anything that's not made

102
00:05:03,370 --> 00:05:04,705
before Mom and Dad
were born?

103
00:05:04,839 --> 00:05:06,207
I mean, right now
I'm on a strict regimen

104
00:05:06,339 --> 00:05:07,608
of black and white movies.

105
00:05:07,742 --> 00:05:09,977
You know, like,
pre-Second World War.

106
00:05:10,945 --> 00:05:12,013
Cringe.

107
00:05:12,445 --> 00:05:14,582
We're gonna,
you know, cut to the right.

108
00:05:14,715 --> 00:05:16,083
- Yeah.
- Huh?

109
00:05:16,217 --> 00:05:17,819
Like, not--
we're gonna go this way.

110
00:05:17,952 --> 00:05:19,352
This way?

111
00:05:19,486 --> 00:05:21,088
Ellie,
I don't know if I can do it.

112
00:05:21,222 --> 00:05:22,890
- It's faster this way.
- No, I know, but--

113
00:05:23,024 --> 00:05:24,725
If you--
if you go slow, it's harder.

114
00:05:24,859 --> 00:05:26,661
- Okay.
- You used to be able--

115
00:05:26,794 --> 00:05:28,663
I know,
I'm behind you.

116
00:05:31,666 --> 00:05:33,000
Jeez.

117
00:05:33,935 --> 00:05:38,105
Uh-oh, I heard a sigh
and a cell phone.

118
00:05:38,506 --> 00:05:40,074
- It was me.
- He's on the phone.

119
00:05:41,108 --> 00:05:42,543
- Yep.
- What is it, Stacey?

120
00:05:43,044 --> 00:05:44,078
No, it's not her.

121
00:05:45,313 --> 00:05:48,549
What, is she mad 'cause
all the reality show girls

122
00:05:48,683 --> 00:05:50,618
want a little piece
of Jonas with the Mostest?

123
00:05:50,751 --> 00:05:53,688
No, you know,

124
00:05:53,821 --> 00:05:55,455
she's part of the game, too,
so she gets it.

125
00:05:55,590 --> 00:05:57,058
It's not--
it's not anything like that.

126
00:05:57,558 --> 00:05:58,826
Wait.

127
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:01,596
She's--
she's an influencer, too?

128
00:06:01,729 --> 00:06:03,631
No, she's a makeup artist.

129
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:05,666
Oh, okay,
so there's hope for her.

130
00:06:07,535 --> 00:06:08,903
Where's your queen, huh?

131
00:06:09,303 --> 00:06:10,470
You know me, man,

132
00:06:11,038 --> 00:06:13,040
I'm busy, uh,
holding down the fort.

133
00:06:13,174 --> 00:06:16,277
Oh, the fort. Mm.

134
00:06:16,711 --> 00:06:18,946
You know, you should
get a vacation from this fort.

135
00:06:19,347 --> 00:06:20,380
No, really.

136
00:06:20,514 --> 00:06:21,582
You should go down to, like,

137
00:06:21,716 --> 00:06:23,084
Rosa or the Bay or something.

138
00:06:23,217 --> 00:06:25,385
I'm sure that
those Oakland hipster bars

139
00:06:25,519 --> 00:06:26,787
or the patios
are probably open.

140
00:06:26,921 --> 00:06:28,656
You can find--
find some girl

141
00:06:28,789 --> 00:06:30,224
that's just as delusional
as you are.

142
00:06:30,358 --> 00:06:31,759
Okay.

143
00:06:31,893 --> 00:06:33,661
You guys can--
can, uh, get a projector

144
00:06:33,794 --> 00:06:35,329
and watch, uh,
I don't know,

145
00:06:35,462 --> 00:06:39,700
18th Century French
i-- infomercials or something.

146
00:06:39,834 --> 00:06:41,969
Get all weird with it.

147
00:06:42,737 --> 00:06:44,338
Yeah, well,
that does sound nice.

148
00:06:44,471 --> 00:06:45,940
Yeah.

149
00:06:46,073 --> 00:06:47,642
As long as I'm not
stuck on my phone

150
00:06:47,775 --> 00:06:49,110
all day, man,
I think I'm gonna be okay.

151
00:06:49,243 --> 00:06:50,845
That's the thing,
though, man,

152
00:06:50,978 --> 00:06:52,647
is everything in LA
is through Instagram.

153
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:55,283
- Like, literally everything.
- Uh-huh.

154
00:06:55,415 --> 00:06:57,551
So, casting directors,
they go, like, a--

155
00:06:57,685 --> 00:06:59,854
they do a #LAModels

156
00:06:59,987 --> 00:07:03,391
or #SurferGuys or something,

157
00:07:03,524 --> 00:07:05,793
and then they--
they DM people like me

158
00:07:05,927 --> 00:07:07,361
to be the next big thing.

159
00:07:07,494 --> 00:07:08,562
Be the next big thing,
you know?

160
00:07:08,696 --> 00:07:10,564
Yeah, people like you?

161
00:07:11,498 --> 00:07:13,200
Yes, LA people like me.

162
00:07:13,935 --> 00:07:15,736
You can give me
the whole spiel

163
00:07:15,870 --> 00:07:17,571
of "That phone
is sucking your soul out"

164
00:07:17,705 --> 00:07:18,739
or whatever, but--

165
00:07:19,307 --> 00:07:22,410
And the more I post,
the more I stack.

166
00:07:22,843 --> 00:07:24,145
It's that simple.

167
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:27,281
And yeah,
I was waiting for a call,

168
00:07:27,415 --> 00:07:30,217
but-- I was waiting
for a call from, um, Duncan.

169
00:07:30,351 --> 00:07:32,320
Remember the producer
I was telling you about? The--

170
00:07:32,954 --> 00:07:34,922
Why are you talking
to someone named Duncan?

171
00:07:35,957 --> 00:07:37,658
What's wrong with Duncan?

172
00:07:37,792 --> 00:07:39,694
You can't trust
anybody named Duncan, Jonas.

173
00:07:39,827 --> 00:07:42,229
- Come on.
- Whatever, man.

174
00:07:42,363 --> 00:07:43,864
He's actually
a good guy.

175
00:07:43,998 --> 00:07:45,465
He's really important
in the industry and stuff.

176
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:47,101
And he's been looking
at my stuff,

177
00:07:47,802 --> 00:07:49,670
saying I have potential
and everything,

178
00:07:49,804 --> 00:07:52,039
trying to pass
my reel along.

179
00:07:53,074 --> 00:07:55,142
Maybe I can be a real actor,
you know?

180
00:07:56,043 --> 00:07:57,111
None of this...

181
00:07:57,912 --> 00:08:01,716
I don't know, foo-foo,
teeny bopper bullshit anymore.

182
00:08:02,984 --> 00:08:04,986
I mean, do you even
like what you're doing?

183
00:08:05,786 --> 00:08:07,555
You know, this,
like, reality show,

184
00:08:07,688 --> 00:08:09,190
Instagram streaming stuff?

185
00:08:09,890 --> 00:08:11,525
- Yeah, I mean--
- I mean...

186
00:08:12,626 --> 00:08:15,463
you should take, like, an
acting class or something, man.

187
00:08:15,596 --> 00:08:17,164
You know,
like an improv class.

188
00:08:17,298 --> 00:08:18,799
Something that you can
really hone your craft, dude--

189
00:08:18,933 --> 00:08:21,469
They're expensive, man.

190
00:08:22,169 --> 00:08:24,805
And this may not be
the most glamorous thing,

191
00:08:24,939 --> 00:08:26,474
but it-- but it pays.

192
00:08:26,974 --> 00:08:29,076
Yeah, but money
doesn't buy happiness.

193
00:08:31,078 --> 00:08:32,580
Buys
a fortune cookie, though.

194
00:08:32,947 --> 00:08:34,982
Yeah, but the fortune
cookie's complimentary.

195
00:08:35,116 --> 00:08:36,917
Yeah,
but you gotta buy the meal

196
00:08:37,618 --> 00:08:38,786
to get the fortune cookie.

197
00:08:38,919 --> 00:08:40,021
- No.
- Right?

198
00:08:40,154 --> 00:08:41,856
I'm not gonna give in.

199
00:08:41,989 --> 00:08:43,824
Anyway, I'm just making
my road to riches, man.

200
00:08:44,258 --> 00:08:46,560
On my way to happiness.
Let's go.

201
00:08:46,694 --> 00:08:47,962
Jonas.

202
00:08:48,696 --> 00:08:50,164
Oh.

203
00:08:53,467 --> 00:08:54,869
Damn.

204
00:08:56,670 --> 00:08:59,073
I forgot about this view.

205
00:09:03,177 --> 00:09:05,179
I thought-- out--
out of the corner of my eye,

206
00:09:05,312 --> 00:09:07,048
I thought you had, like,
a flip phone or something.

207
00:09:07,181 --> 00:09:09,183
You already lost, baby bro?

208
00:09:09,316 --> 00:09:12,053
It's Dad's compass.
Mom gave it to me.

209
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:14,321
She gave it to Dad
a few Christmases back.

210
00:09:14,455 --> 00:09:15,524
You were there, though.

211
00:09:16,123 --> 00:09:18,125
You know,
when he got lost in Yosemite.

212
00:09:18,659 --> 00:09:21,996
Yeah. Yeah.
Can I see that?

213
00:09:34,241 --> 00:09:35,409
I remember thinking

214
00:09:36,343 --> 00:09:39,013
that if Dad could beat
Half Dome like that,

215
00:09:39,146 --> 00:09:40,881
you know,
going off to the side

216
00:09:41,015 --> 00:09:43,651
and sleeping-- sleeping
on the fly or whatever, that...

217
00:09:45,086 --> 00:09:47,588
I don't know, beating cancer
would be a breeze.

218
00:09:49,390 --> 00:09:50,658
It wasn't cancer.

219
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:56,697
Ellie, I think
I would know how our dad died.

220
00:09:56,831 --> 00:09:58,732
It was leukemia, Jonas.

221
00:09:58,866 --> 00:10:00,134
It's the same thing.

222
00:10:00,267 --> 00:10:01,969
Are you ser--
It's not the same thing.

223
00:10:04,004 --> 00:10:05,940
I mean, come on,
I mean, you should remember.

224
00:10:06,073 --> 00:10:07,942
You were at that funeral.

225
00:10:14,648 --> 00:10:15,749
Ellie, I don't want to--

226
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:18,319
I don't want to
do this all day, okay?

227
00:10:19,153 --> 00:10:21,889
There wasn't a global pandemic
when Dad died.

228
00:10:22,389 --> 00:10:23,657
All right.

229
00:10:25,292 --> 00:10:27,529
-I guess that was a bit harsh.
-Yeah.

230
00:10:28,195 --> 00:10:31,031
But I don't know, man.
Food for thought.

231
00:10:31,165 --> 00:10:34,068
Maybe next time
you're at a Zoom funeral,

232
00:10:34,201 --> 00:10:36,370
you don't black out your screen
the whole time.

233
00:10:38,507 --> 00:10:40,174
Because, you know,
people want to see you.

234
00:10:41,742 --> 00:10:43,110
Even if it is over Zoom.

235
00:10:44,111 --> 00:10:46,747
Zoom funeral.

236
00:10:47,448 --> 00:10:48,583
Damn.

237
00:10:48,716 --> 00:10:51,785
That is so 2020.
Goddamn 'rona.

238
00:10:53,888 --> 00:10:54,989
It is what it is, man.

239
00:10:55,489 --> 00:10:58,259
And we're here now,
so, let's just...

240
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:00,928
let's enjoy it.

241
00:11:03,164 --> 00:11:06,100
You know, being out here,
you could see why Mom loved it.

242
00:11:07,536 --> 00:11:10,971
Trails, scenery, everything.

243
00:11:15,142 --> 00:11:15,976
Yeah.

244
00:11:16,511 --> 00:11:18,345
Let's give it to her
one last time, yeah?

245
00:11:57,418 --> 00:11:58,687
Where's your mask?

246
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:09,330
Hey, uh,
let me get that for you.

247
00:12:09,698 --> 00:12:11,031
Oh, oh, oh, yeah, yeah.

248
00:12:11,165 --> 00:12:12,866
-Oh! Thank you, thank you.
-There you are.

249
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,337
Yeah, I just love
the smell of lemons, you know.

250
00:12:20,241 --> 00:12:21,809
You know what I mean,
right?

251
00:12:21,942 --> 00:12:25,312
I mean, not really.
Oh. Ooh. Ooh.

252
00:12:26,146 --> 00:12:28,949
You two are actually the first
people I've met all day.

253
00:12:33,087 --> 00:12:35,923
Yeah.
That's a-- that's a lemon.

254
00:12:36,056 --> 00:12:37,324
Yeah, quite right, right?

255
00:12:37,458 --> 00:12:39,026
-Some o' that.
-So, are you two local?

256
00:12:39,393 --> 00:12:42,396
Uh, yeah, I mean, we're-- we're
from here originally,

257
00:12:42,530 --> 00:12:46,300
but now I live
in West Hollywood, so...

258
00:12:46,433 --> 00:12:47,968
Interesting.

259
00:12:48,102 --> 00:12:50,204
I mean, I thought Hollywood
was fascinating enough

260
00:12:50,337 --> 00:12:53,474
without the distinct
directions involved.

261
00:12:53,608 --> 00:12:54,709
Yeah.

262
00:12:54,842 --> 00:12:55,909
So what are your names?

263
00:12:56,043 --> 00:12:58,112
Uh, I'm Jonas with--

264
00:12:58,245 --> 00:13:00,649
I'm Jonas.
And, uh, this here is Ellie.

265
00:13:00,781 --> 00:13:04,418
Uh, Elliot, you can, uh--
you can call me Elliot.

266
00:13:04,552 --> 00:13:07,354
Jonas and Elliot.
Such nice names.

267
00:13:07,488 --> 00:13:08,822
Uh, thank you.

268
00:13:10,224 --> 00:13:12,960
-What's your name?
-Where are my manners?

269
00:13:13,093 --> 00:13:16,196
I'm Paloma,
which means pigeon in Spanish,

270
00:13:16,330 --> 00:13:18,799
so you won't forget.

271
00:13:18,932 --> 00:13:20,669
Don't think
we'll forget that one.

272
00:13:20,801 --> 00:13:23,070
Especially Ellie here.

273
00:13:23,203 --> 00:13:24,104
Um.

274
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:27,776
- Uh, why pigeon?
- Uh, what do you mean?

275
00:13:28,309 --> 00:13:30,177
Well, like,
don't, uh, pigeon and dove,

276
00:13:30,311 --> 00:13:31,746
like, essentially mean
the same thing?

277
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:34,948
Uh, in a way.

278
00:13:35,082 --> 00:13:37,552
I mean, it all depends
on the connotation.

279
00:13:37,686 --> 00:13:39,420
They do get various press.

280
00:13:39,554 --> 00:13:42,456
Um, I guess I just
always associated more

281
00:13:42,590 --> 00:13:43,725
with pigeons than doves.

282
00:13:44,291 --> 00:13:47,294
Um, but maybe
I can reincarnate as a dove

283
00:13:47,428 --> 00:13:49,463
in my next lifetime
for a change.

284
00:13:49,897 --> 00:13:51,131
Uh...

285
00:13:51,265 --> 00:13:53,067
Well,
this has been really cool.

286
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:55,135
Um, you know, I think
we should be heading out--

287
00:13:55,269 --> 00:13:57,104
Well, hold on. What-- what--
Uh, what brings you up here?

288
00:13:57,237 --> 00:13:59,239
You're just, uh,
you're just picking lemons?

289
00:13:59,607 --> 00:14:02,409
Uh, it's kind of silly.
I'm just wandering around.

290
00:14:02,544 --> 00:14:05,112
But not all those
who wander are lost, right?

291
00:14:05,245 --> 00:14:08,415
So, what are you up to?

292
00:14:08,849 --> 00:14:10,117
Jut going on a hike.

293
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:11,352
Actually, just spreading
our Mom's ashes.

294
00:14:11,485 --> 00:14:13,588
- Oh, Jesus.
- Sorry.

295
00:14:14,021 --> 00:14:15,557
Yeah.

296
00:14:15,690 --> 00:14:19,226
Um, my brother
just passed away recently, too.

297
00:14:19,761 --> 00:14:20,762
Really?

298
00:14:20,894 --> 00:14:23,163
I'm-- I'm so sorry.

299
00:14:23,297 --> 00:14:25,032
I mean,
that's actually why I'm here.

300
00:14:25,399 --> 00:14:27,502
You know, he went
to University of Berkeley

301
00:14:27,635 --> 00:14:30,839
and when I was a child,
we came to visit him,

302
00:14:30,971 --> 00:14:32,973
and he took my parents
wine tasting

303
00:14:33,107 --> 00:14:34,375
and showed us
this place.

304
00:14:34,509 --> 00:14:37,077
So, this trip
is really for him.

305
00:14:37,211 --> 00:14:38,813
That's, like,
a typical wine tasting.

306
00:14:38,946 --> 00:14:40,047
That's really sweet.

307
00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:41,982
Um, where's home for you?

308
00:14:42,449 --> 00:14:44,051
Um, originally, Spain.

309
00:14:44,184 --> 00:14:45,452
But now,
when I'm not flying around,

310
00:14:45,587 --> 00:14:47,321
I would say
Singapore is home.

311
00:14:47,454 --> 00:14:48,523
Singapore?

312
00:14:49,156 --> 00:14:53,060
- Holy shit.
- Wait, what?

313
00:14:53,193 --> 00:14:55,229
You-- you're fa--
you're familiar with Singapore?

314
00:14:55,362 --> 00:14:58,700
I lo-- I love "phuh"-- "phuh."
It's pho-- pho?

315
00:14:58,833 --> 00:15:02,436
Hey, um, since you two are
local, I do have a favor.

316
00:15:02,570 --> 00:15:05,573
You know, uh, I was-- I was--
I was trying to revisit

317
00:15:05,707 --> 00:15:07,274
some of my childhood places,

318
00:15:07,408 --> 00:15:09,977
um, and I lied a little
back then,

319
00:15:10,110 --> 00:15:12,913
uh, so-- it's more like
a fib, so...

320
00:15:13,046 --> 00:15:16,350
And now I'm a little lost.
You know, it's been some time.

321
00:15:16,483 --> 00:15:18,419
Um, so I was wondering
if you two can--

322
00:15:18,553 --> 00:15:20,320
-We'll-- help you? Yeah.
-Yeah.

323
00:15:20,454 --> 00:15:22,256
Well, I mean,
I know this-- this whole area

324
00:15:22,389 --> 00:15:24,057
like it's my backyard.

325
00:15:24,191 --> 00:15:25,727
I mean, definitely,
I-- I know it really well.

326
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:27,562
We-- we've got some important
stuff to do, though.

327
00:15:27,695 --> 00:15:29,697
-Yeah, but Jonas--
-It was really nice meeting--

328
00:15:29,831 --> 00:15:31,432
No, no,
we can help our friend.

329
00:15:31,566 --> 00:15:33,200
Right, Paloma?

330
00:15:33,333 --> 00:15:35,402
Yeah, I appreciate that.

331
00:15:40,073 --> 00:15:41,341
Yeah.

332
00:15:49,818 --> 00:15:52,119
So,
I remember this grand tree,

333
00:15:52,252 --> 00:15:54,589
-all by it's lonesome.
-Yeah, I know the one.

334
00:15:54,722 --> 00:15:56,156
It's on the other side
of the vineyard.

335
00:15:56,290 --> 00:15:57,357
Are you sure
it's the same tree?

336
00:15:57,491 --> 00:16:00,294
-Yeah, I'm sure.
-Okay.

337
00:16:02,162 --> 00:16:05,332
Wait, we should all
race down the vineyard.

338
00:16:05,466 --> 00:16:08,903
It will be so exciting.
It's like <i>Jules and Jim.</i>

339
00:16:09,036 --> 00:16:10,839
- I'll be Jules.
- Wait, wait.

340
00:16:11,639 --> 00:16:14,041
You, uh--
you know Truffaut?

341
00:16:14,174 --> 00:16:16,678
Yeah, of course.
"If I'm lying, may my mother..."

342
00:16:16,811 --> 00:16:18,546
"...keel over
at this very moment."

343
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:20,949
-Shoot the piano player.
-Yeah. Talking about brothers.

344
00:16:21,081 --> 00:16:23,885
You know, one of my favorite
ones is <i>The Soft Skin.</i>

345
00:16:24,017 --> 00:16:25,587
I think it's so good.

346
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:27,020
That ending when the woman
comes into the restaurant

347
00:16:27,154 --> 00:16:28,422
and blows her husband away?

348
00:16:28,556 --> 00:16:30,324
-Oh, it's ruthless.
-Yeah, I know.

349
00:16:30,457 --> 00:16:32,159
You know, uh, another one,
it's kind of one of his--

350
00:16:32,292 --> 00:16:33,895
Yo, yo, can we, uh,
can we-- Hey!

351
00:16:34,027 --> 00:16:36,330
Can we, uh,
move on, I guess?

352
00:16:36,463 --> 00:16:37,799
-Yeah, let's do it.
-Okay, okay.

353
00:16:37,932 --> 00:16:39,901
Racers,
let's get on our marks.

354
00:16:40,033 --> 00:16:41,401
Hey, maybe
you don't have to go

355
00:16:41,536 --> 00:16:43,003
to those hipster bars
after all, Ellie.

356
00:16:43,136 --> 00:16:44,939
-Okay.
-No, no, no, put the bag on.

357
00:16:45,072 --> 00:16:46,741
-Come on.
-Well-- okay.

358
00:16:46,875 --> 00:16:48,342
You can't win with a bag?

359
00:16:48,843 --> 00:16:50,110
-Okay.
-All right.

360
00:16:50,244 --> 00:16:51,311
-Are we ready?
-Yeah, let's do it.

361
00:16:51,445 --> 00:16:53,347
All right.
Three, two--

362
00:16:54,081 --> 00:16:55,482
Are you serious?

363
00:16:55,617 --> 00:16:57,585
-I haven't said one!
-He went ahead.

364
00:16:59,486 --> 00:17:01,388
<i>♪ I'll leave</i>
<i>this bitter world behind ♪</i>

365
00:17:01,523 --> 00:17:06,059
<i>♪ Angel on my shoulder,</i>
<i>I got the devil on my mind ♪</i>

366
00:17:10,832 --> 00:17:15,135
We want Jonas!
We want Jonas! We want Jonas!

367
00:17:15,870 --> 00:17:17,404
You know
you cheated, right?

368
00:17:19,007 --> 00:17:22,276
Yeah, I cheated.
Cheated at being the best.

369
00:17:22,944 --> 00:17:25,212
Hoo.

370
00:17:25,345 --> 00:17:26,781
Oh, my God.

371
00:17:27,180 --> 00:17:28,448
God.

372
00:17:37,057 --> 00:17:38,325
It's funny.

373
00:17:39,761 --> 00:17:42,664
Not funny like "haha,"
but you know what people say.

374
00:17:43,631 --> 00:17:45,633
My brother and I,
we made a pact.

375
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:48,468
Remember
we spit-shook on it.

376
00:17:50,038 --> 00:17:51,806
It was before COVID.

377
00:17:54,274 --> 00:17:55,543
Before times.

378
00:18:03,450 --> 00:18:05,218
We promised each other

379
00:18:05,352 --> 00:18:07,120
we would travel
around the world

380
00:18:07,254 --> 00:18:09,857
and live life
to the fullest.

381
00:18:10,858 --> 00:18:13,260
And to always
keep each other close,

382
00:18:13,393 --> 00:18:15,295
even if we are far away.

383
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:22,870
And it's somehow just now,

384
00:18:23,671 --> 00:18:25,940
a few months
after he passed away,

385
00:18:26,074 --> 00:18:28,776
that it's settling in.

386
00:18:32,346 --> 00:18:34,048
My mother and father
are still around,

387
00:18:34,181 --> 00:18:35,550
but it's not the same.

388
00:18:37,351 --> 00:18:40,420
No one to be spiritually
defenseless with,

389
00:18:40,555 --> 00:18:44,424
or to share
fears and secrets,

390
00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:47,829
or to even ask
outlandish questions

391
00:18:48,362 --> 00:18:50,497
without fear of judgment.

392
00:18:54,334 --> 00:18:59,239
Just tough love
and tender advice.

393
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:14,287
You are a good tree.

394
00:19:15,288 --> 00:19:16,557
Goodbye.

395
00:19:26,701 --> 00:19:30,203
I just have one last spot
I want to visit

396
00:19:30,337 --> 00:19:31,639
and I will be satisfied.

397
00:19:32,073 --> 00:19:34,776
Uh, yeah, no, no, no,
of course.

398
00:19:34,909 --> 00:19:36,110
What? Where?

399
00:19:36,243 --> 00:19:37,512
It's like
a body of water.

400
00:19:37,645 --> 00:19:38,980
I remember it being
rather large.

401
00:19:39,614 --> 00:19:41,381
Yeah, yeah, I know
what you're talking about.

402
00:19:41,516 --> 00:19:43,216
I mean, we're kinda
heading that way.

403
00:19:43,350 --> 00:19:44,852
You just want to join us?

404
00:19:44,986 --> 00:19:46,386
- Oh, really?
- You know, it might be...

405
00:19:47,121 --> 00:19:48,890
it might be that pond
that's, like, right over there.

406
00:19:49,023 --> 00:19:50,591
I mean, it's, like, decent size

407
00:19:50,725 --> 00:19:52,126
'cause you were, like,
a shrimpy-ass kid at the time.

408
00:19:52,259 --> 00:19:53,561
That might have been--

409
00:19:53,728 --> 00:19:55,228
Yeah, I-- I'm pretty sure
it's Mom's lake.

410
00:19:55,663 --> 00:19:57,464
No, no, like, the one--
that's, like, the one

411
00:19:57,598 --> 00:19:59,600
that's, like,
literally right over there.

412
00:20:03,004 --> 00:20:04,839
So the last time
I came with my brother,

413
00:20:04,972 --> 00:20:07,842
we buried,
like, a time capsule.

414
00:20:08,576 --> 00:20:10,511
And I was hoping
to retrieve it today.

415
00:20:10,645 --> 00:20:12,613
-A time capsule?
-You got to be shitting me.

416
00:20:12,747 --> 00:20:14,314
Like, I don't wanna
be here all day,

417
00:20:14,448 --> 00:20:15,850
trying to suss out
some buried treasure.

418
00:20:15,983 --> 00:20:17,350
Do you have, like,
a map or something

419
00:20:17,484 --> 00:20:18,686
in that fanny pack, Pigeon?

420
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:21,823
I remember it was off the shore
of a body of water.

421
00:20:23,191 --> 00:20:24,458
Oh.

422
00:20:24,625 --> 00:20:27,294
Was there a pier,
or-- or cattails?

423
00:20:27,895 --> 00:20:29,429
That I didn't remember,

424
00:20:29,564 --> 00:20:31,766
but it felt
much larger than this.

425
00:20:31,899 --> 00:20:33,901
That's what she said.

426
00:20:36,236 --> 00:20:37,572
I'm gonna take
a phone call.

427
00:20:40,842 --> 00:20:42,844
Duncan.
It's, um, it's Jonas.

428
00:20:42,977 --> 00:20:44,979
Um, I know you're at those
meetings probably right now.

429
00:20:45,113 --> 00:20:47,215
You're probably talking to
people, you know, this and that

430
00:20:47,347 --> 00:20:48,850
and, uh, I just want to see

431
00:20:48,983 --> 00:20:50,551
if maybe you were able
to put my name out there.

432
00:20:50,685 --> 00:20:53,487
Like, uh, show them my reel
that I gave you.

433
00:20:53,621 --> 00:20:56,323
I-- I also want to make sure
that link worked, um,

434
00:20:56,456 --> 00:20:58,726
and let them know--
let them know-- I know

435
00:20:58,860 --> 00:21:00,795
I have, like, a lot of
reality stuff on there,

436
00:21:00,928 --> 00:21:02,462
but let them know
I can do anything, man.

437
00:21:02,597 --> 00:21:04,665
I can do comedy,
drama, horror.

438
00:21:04,799 --> 00:21:08,503
I don't know, anything.
Uh, uh, I'm down for whatever.

439
00:21:08,636 --> 00:21:11,572
Um, yeah, I hope
to hear from you soon.

440
00:21:11,706 --> 00:21:13,541
Hopefully after today,
you're probably gonna be tired,

441
00:21:13,674 --> 00:21:15,109
but, like, you know, feel free
to call me tomorrow, man.

442
00:21:15,243 --> 00:21:19,046
Do-- do whatever.
Uh, uh, so this is Jonas.

443
00:21:19,180 --> 00:21:20,581
Jonas with the Mostest.

444
00:21:20,715 --> 00:21:23,518
You know, like,
uh, that thing, uh...

445
00:21:24,619 --> 00:21:26,654
Yeah, man.
Uh, let me know.

446
00:21:26,788 --> 00:21:28,656
Jonas out.

447
00:21:40,935 --> 00:21:42,870
Yo, you know
what time it is?

448
00:21:43,004 --> 00:21:45,973
It's your boy, Jonas.
Jonas with the Mostest.

449
00:21:46,107 --> 00:21:48,441
Here coming at you
from Sonoma, California,

450
00:21:48,576 --> 00:21:51,411
with my DTF shades. Ah!

451
00:21:51,546 --> 00:21:52,980
Again? I mean, it's just...

452
00:21:53,114 --> 00:21:54,715
Coming at you
with the "Hey, guys!"

453
00:21:54,849 --> 00:21:55,883
What?

454
00:21:56,551 --> 00:21:58,719
Uh, nothing, you just...

455
00:21:59,486 --> 00:22:00,988
you gotta let him
do his thing

456
00:22:01,122 --> 00:22:02,857
and let it get him-- let it--
let him just get it out

457
00:22:02,990 --> 00:22:05,159
of his system, and then--
you know what?

458
00:22:05,293 --> 00:22:08,162
I'm here to help you,
so let's just look.

459
00:22:09,063 --> 00:22:11,933
Actually, I'm not sensing
any mystical energy

460
00:22:12,066 --> 00:22:14,836
that a young Paloma would
bury her time capsule here.

461
00:22:15,770 --> 00:22:17,939
I think we ought to take
a look at your mother's site.

462
00:22:18,438 --> 00:22:20,942
Yeah, no,
that's-- that sounds great.

463
00:22:21,075 --> 00:22:23,443
Yeah, once he's done
doing that,

464
00:22:23,578 --> 00:22:25,046
then we'll get started.

465
00:22:26,214 --> 00:22:27,548
Here.

466
00:22:31,384 --> 00:22:32,452
What's that?

467
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:35,256
Oh, this is just an old--
kind of an old--

468
00:22:35,388 --> 00:22:37,925
- No, that.
- Oh, this?

469
00:22:39,060 --> 00:22:40,228
You're looking at this.

470
00:22:40,862 --> 00:22:43,496
This is, uh,
my dad's compass.

471
00:22:44,999 --> 00:22:46,567
That's quite heavy
for a compass.

472
00:22:46,701 --> 00:22:48,236
I thought
they were usually lighter.

473
00:22:48,803 --> 00:22:50,538
Yeah, well,
I think my mom wanted

474
00:22:50,671 --> 00:22:52,306
to get my dad something
that was kind of bulky and big

475
00:22:52,439 --> 00:22:54,141
so he wouldn't lose it
so easily.

476
00:22:54,275 --> 00:22:57,578
You know, he used to get--
he used to get lost sometimes.

477
00:22:58,079 --> 00:22:59,479
That's smart.

478
00:22:59,614 --> 00:23:01,148
Me, I have a horrible sense
of direction.

479
00:23:01,716 --> 00:23:02,984
Oh, that's all right.

480
00:23:03,117 --> 00:23:04,919
I mean, I know
where my mom's lake is,

481
00:23:05,052 --> 00:23:07,355
and it's-- it's definitely
no Mediterranean,

482
00:23:07,487 --> 00:23:08,990
but it's a pretty good lake.

483
00:23:09,624 --> 00:23:11,125
Mediterranean.

484
00:23:11,259 --> 00:23:14,427
I wish I can take a dip
in that glorious sea again.

485
00:23:15,395 --> 00:23:17,064
Good thing
I didn't bury it there.

486
00:23:17,198 --> 00:23:18,366
We'd never have found it.

487
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,736
Well, we're gonna find it,
and if not today,

488
00:23:21,869 --> 00:23:23,905
then we can look tomorrow
or the next day.

489
00:23:24,038 --> 00:23:25,506
I'm free
the next couple of days,

490
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:27,008
so it really doesn't matter.

491
00:23:27,141 --> 00:23:29,043
-We can--
-I can't. I fly home tonight.

492
00:23:29,176 --> 00:23:31,444
You-- you--
you fly home tonight?

493
00:23:31,579 --> 00:23:32,847
Yeah.

494
00:23:33,446 --> 00:23:34,849
Oh.

495
00:23:34,982 --> 00:23:36,617
It's not like that.
It's for work.

496
00:23:37,018 --> 00:23:38,052
Oh.

497
00:23:38,653 --> 00:23:40,955
For work.
Okay, that makes sense.

498
00:23:41,088 --> 00:23:43,190
Uh, what do you do
for work?

499
00:23:43,324 --> 00:23:44,592
Oh, you can take a guess.

500
00:23:44,725 --> 00:23:46,160
You want me to--
you want me to guess?

501
00:23:46,294 --> 00:23:48,896
- Mm-hmm.
- Oh, okay, um...

502
00:23:49,864 --> 00:23:51,431
Well,
you say you're a pigeon,

503
00:23:51,565 --> 00:23:54,969
and you also say
you fly around a lot, so...

504
00:23:56,070 --> 00:23:59,206
I'm gonna say pilot.

505
00:23:59,607 --> 00:24:01,676
Close, but I don't have
that much control.

506
00:24:01,809 --> 00:24:05,212
Okay, control.
Um, flight attendant?

507
00:24:06,314 --> 00:24:07,915
Singaporean Air.

508
00:24:08,448 --> 00:24:09,817
That's cool.

509
00:24:09,951 --> 00:24:12,053
Yeah, I just hand out
the free crackers.

510
00:24:12,186 --> 00:24:13,921
I never travel
with the same crew,

511
00:24:14,055 --> 00:24:15,756
so no sense
of companionship.

512
00:24:15,890 --> 00:24:17,591
Not like what
you and your brother have.

513
00:24:19,459 --> 00:24:23,064
Yeah, well, you don't really
know us that well, Paloma.

514
00:24:23,798 --> 00:24:26,400
But still, I wish--
I wish you could at least

515
00:24:26,534 --> 00:24:28,336
hang out a little bit more
before your flight, you know.

516
00:24:28,468 --> 00:24:30,705
I mean, you could come back
and hang out at our place

517
00:24:30,838 --> 00:24:33,441
for a little bit,
or-- or I mean, my place.

518
00:24:33,574 --> 00:24:36,010
It-- it used to be our place,
but it's my place now.

519
00:24:36,143 --> 00:24:37,979
Some confusion
over whose place it is?

520
00:24:38,112 --> 00:24:40,147
No, no, I--
there's no confusion.

521
00:24:40,281 --> 00:24:43,918
It's just that-- it's Jonas
and I's childhood home,

522
00:24:44,051 --> 00:24:45,786
you know,
it was my mom and dad's,

523
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:47,888
and Jonas and I were raised
there our whole lives,

524
00:24:48,022 --> 00:24:50,591
through and through,
straight up and down.

525
00:24:51,125 --> 00:24:52,259
But...

526
00:24:53,127 --> 00:24:55,296
you know, just don't say
anything to Jonas

527
00:24:55,429 --> 00:24:57,698
about me saying that
it was my house and not his,

528
00:24:57,832 --> 00:24:59,333
'cause, you know,
it's a little complicated.

529
00:24:59,467 --> 00:25:01,869
Okay. So you've never moved,
huh? Your only home?

530
00:25:03,637 --> 00:25:04,805
No.

531
00:25:04,939 --> 00:25:06,307
Oh, wow.

532
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:08,909
Can't tell you how many times
I've moved in my day.

533
00:25:10,444 --> 00:25:11,512
Yeah.

534
00:25:12,046 --> 00:25:13,881
But I guess
it's not a bad place

535
00:25:14,015 --> 00:25:17,118
to grow up
or settle down.

536
00:25:18,652 --> 00:25:20,354
At least I know somebody
who lives here now.

537
00:25:21,856 --> 00:25:24,058
Yeah, you got me there
for sure.

538
00:25:24,191 --> 00:25:25,626
...down there,
but, you know,

539
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:28,729
we out here,
we doing the thing.

540
00:25:28,863 --> 00:25:30,398
<i>Anyway, just want to say</i>
<i>that I'm so stoked</i>

541
00:25:30,531 --> 00:25:33,701
<i>to get back on set,</i>
<i>thanks to DTF Eyewear.</i>

542
00:25:33,834 --> 00:25:35,970
<i>Stay tuned</i>
<i>and stay gorgeous.</i>

543
00:25:42,843 --> 00:25:44,111
Stupid.

544
00:25:54,855 --> 00:25:56,991
Hey, hey, hey, Dun--

545
00:25:59,060 --> 00:26:00,127
Hey, babe.

546
00:26:05,633 --> 00:26:06,934
Look, I was--

547
00:26:07,468 --> 00:26:10,471
I was dead ass
texting you as you called.

548
00:26:10,604 --> 00:26:12,073
You interrupted, so...

549
00:26:17,445 --> 00:26:18,513
Stacey.

550
00:26:19,346 --> 00:26:21,982
Babe, it--
it's not that simple, okay?

551
00:26:22,116 --> 00:26:24,852
These-- these things-- you know,
these things take time.

552
00:26:24,985 --> 00:26:26,654
You got to finesse
the situation.

553
00:26:26,787 --> 00:26:28,155
I'm doing everything right.

554
00:26:28,557 --> 00:26:31,859
Uh, you know, I-- I gotta go
do the ashes and shit,

555
00:26:31,992 --> 00:26:33,260
and then after that--

556
00:26:34,195 --> 00:26:35,396
Babe, I promise,

557
00:26:35,830 --> 00:26:37,731
the house is gonna be
on the market,

558
00:26:37,865 --> 00:26:40,134
and the money's gonna be
in our pockets, okay?

559
00:26:40,668 --> 00:26:43,671
All right?
So, just trust me. Okay?

560
00:26:45,439 --> 00:26:46,707
Okay.

561
00:27:01,989 --> 00:27:03,891
Can I see
your home from here?

562
00:27:04,325 --> 00:27:06,460
Uh, not really.

563
00:27:06,595 --> 00:27:08,662
It's kinda on the other side
of that hill right there,

564
00:27:08,796 --> 00:27:10,164
you know,
at the end of that street.

565
00:27:10,297 --> 00:27:11,665
Uh-huh.

566
00:27:11,799 --> 00:27:13,667
I mean, it's pretty,
at least from here.

567
00:27:14,034 --> 00:27:15,537
The whole town, too.

568
00:27:15,669 --> 00:27:18,105
Yeah, I guess it used to be
a lot prettier, though.

569
00:27:18,706 --> 00:27:20,107
You know,
our house used to have,

570
00:27:20,241 --> 00:27:21,976
you know,
this nice little quaint street

571
00:27:22,109 --> 00:27:24,044
with these little,
like, countryside cottages.

572
00:27:24,445 --> 00:27:26,147
But then all these
yuppies came in

573
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:29,717
and, you know, want to build
big, big mansions.

574
00:27:30,651 --> 00:27:34,388
Hey, Jonas, you know that, uh,
that pathway you used to love?

575
00:27:34,523 --> 00:27:36,490
You know, the one with the
blackberries and the llamas?

576
00:27:36,625 --> 00:27:38,527
The one where we used to do
our lemonade stands?

577
00:27:39,093 --> 00:27:40,961
Yeah, yeah,
I love that path.

578
00:27:41,095 --> 00:27:44,899
Yeah, you loved it.
But it's not here anymore.

579
00:27:45,032 --> 00:27:46,667
Some rich family
comes in

580
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:49,036
and they want to, you know,
fence it off for themselves.

581
00:27:49,170 --> 00:27:51,939
You know, they want to fence
off the creek and the hill.

582
00:27:52,574 --> 00:27:53,941
Everyone wants Sonoma

583
00:27:54,074 --> 00:27:56,377
for their own little
bubble-- bubble getaway.

584
00:27:57,111 --> 00:27:58,580
Elliot,
it's a free world, man.

585
00:27:59,213 --> 00:28:01,048
I mean, people should be able
to get what they want, right?

586
00:28:01,182 --> 00:28:04,351
Like, especially if they got
that cheddar, you know?

587
00:28:05,219 --> 00:28:07,589
I mean, you know you're talking
about our neighborhood, right?

588
00:28:07,755 --> 00:28:09,056
I mean,
that's where we grew up.

589
00:28:11,025 --> 00:28:12,426
It's not my neighborhood.

590
00:28:13,494 --> 00:28:14,828
Not anymore, anyway.

591
00:28:15,930 --> 00:28:18,432
Still,
it's a nice time to grow up.

592
00:28:19,833 --> 00:28:21,035
Yeah, I mean,

593
00:28:21,468 --> 00:28:24,405
sure, Sonoma has its--
its perks and stuff,

594
00:28:24,539 --> 00:28:28,375
but I don't know, it's like
a-- a lukewarm bathtub.

595
00:28:28,510 --> 00:28:31,646
It's nice, and you feel cozy
for a little bit,

596
00:28:31,779 --> 00:28:33,013
but then you start to shrivel

597
00:28:33,147 --> 00:28:34,915
and you know
you got to get out.

598
00:28:35,849 --> 00:28:37,218
Quite a simile, Jonas.

599
00:28:37,718 --> 00:28:38,786
Thank you.

600
00:28:38,919 --> 00:28:40,254
It's like, uh...

601
00:28:41,121 --> 00:28:42,624
Singapore is an island, yeah?

602
00:28:43,390 --> 00:28:45,292
No, it's a--
it's a peninsula.

603
00:28:45,426 --> 00:28:46,860
But if it's not an island,

604
00:28:46,994 --> 00:28:48,630
it might as well be.

605
00:28:48,762 --> 00:28:50,764
because other than
school and work,

606
00:28:50,898 --> 00:28:52,233
there's not much to do.

607
00:28:52,766 --> 00:28:54,201
Except for the food, though.

608
00:28:54,335 --> 00:28:56,003
I do love the food.

609
00:28:56,403 --> 00:28:58,640
Yeah, sounds exactly
like Sonoma,

610
00:28:58,772 --> 00:29:00,207
except for,
you know, the food.

611
00:29:00,741 --> 00:29:03,911
But instead of, you know,
being surrounded by ocean,

612
00:29:04,044 --> 00:29:05,513
it's surrounded by grapes.

613
00:29:05,647 --> 00:29:09,718
Every-- every-- every path
leads to a dead end.

614
00:29:10,384 --> 00:29:12,987
That's a vineyard.
It's like this--

615
00:29:13,555 --> 00:29:16,591
this hella claustrophobic, uh,
island life,

616
00:29:16,725 --> 00:29:19,694
but without any of the tropical
perks that you have,

617
00:29:19,827 --> 00:29:21,696
uh, just the cabernet.

618
00:29:22,062 --> 00:29:24,431
I don't get it.
How can it be an island?

619
00:29:24,566 --> 00:29:27,067
I mean, isn't San Francisco
just right there?

620
00:29:27,201 --> 00:29:30,904
And-- and Oakland, Berkeley?
The whole Bay area?

621
00:29:31,038 --> 00:29:32,306
Pigeon, pigeon.

622
00:29:32,906 --> 00:29:34,441
Spread your wings.
Fly around.

623
00:29:34,576 --> 00:29:37,378
Look, there's grapes
in every direction.

624
00:29:37,512 --> 00:29:41,683
Even-- even, uh, uh, Napa,
which is, like, right there.

625
00:29:41,815 --> 00:29:44,118
And I don't-- I don't know
why you'd want to go to Napa.

626
00:29:44,619 --> 00:29:46,186
They have an In-N-Out,
which is dope,

627
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:49,456
but it's-- it's--
it's 15 minutes away,

628
00:29:49,957 --> 00:29:51,392
but it feels
world's apart.

629
00:29:52,159 --> 00:29:53,628
And they don't even let
nicotine in there,

630
00:29:53,762 --> 00:29:55,429
but that's, like--
that's-- that's their thing.

631
00:29:55,896 --> 00:29:58,065
But-- okay.

632
00:29:58,198 --> 00:30:01,770
If <i>Survivor</i>
had a season in Sonoma,

633
00:30:02,136 --> 00:30:04,171
then everybody would vote
themselves off the island.

634
00:30:04,305 --> 00:30:05,873
They wouldn't get past
the first episode.

635
00:30:06,006 --> 00:30:08,475
And I knew-- I knew
that I didn't want to...

636
00:30:09,476 --> 00:30:11,478
grow old and die here
a nobody.

637
00:30:11,613 --> 00:30:12,846
Well, I mean,

638
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:14,783
what do you think
about Mom and Dad?

639
00:30:14,915 --> 00:30:16,518
What, you think
they're just nobodies,

640
00:30:16,651 --> 00:30:18,218
'cause they weren't on
the cover of <i>People Magazine?</i>

641
00:30:18,352 --> 00:30:19,887
No, Ellie,
that's not what I'm saying.

642
00:30:20,020 --> 00:30:21,556
I mean, they had
a family around them, man,

643
00:30:21,690 --> 00:30:22,856
and a community and people
that cared about them

644
00:30:22,990 --> 00:30:23,957
until the very end.

645
00:30:24,091 --> 00:30:25,492
-Okay?
-Cool.

646
00:30:26,293 --> 00:30:29,330
I know. If you want
to rank their-- their level

647
00:30:29,463 --> 00:30:31,398
of Sonoma fame, go ahead.
They were pretty cool,

648
00:30:31,533 --> 00:30:34,034
they had a good life,
but they had excitement

649
00:30:34,168 --> 00:30:36,136
in the '70s and the '80s

650
00:30:36,270 --> 00:30:38,005
and then
they settled down here.

651
00:30:38,405 --> 00:30:39,873
That's what
I've been trying to say,

652
00:30:40,007 --> 00:30:41,842
is that you especially
need a vacation.

653
00:30:41,975 --> 00:30:43,377
You need to
get out of here.

654
00:30:43,511 --> 00:30:45,245
Get out of-- get out of the--
the grapes, man.

655
00:30:45,379 --> 00:30:47,114
Shit. Go to Singapore.
Take a break.

656
00:30:47,247 --> 00:30:49,350
You think I don't-- you think
I don't want to do that?

657
00:30:49,483 --> 00:30:51,251
You don't think
I want to get out of here, man?

658
00:30:51,385 --> 00:30:53,387
But, you know,
I've been busy,

659
00:30:53,521 --> 00:30:55,189
you know,
taking care of our dead mom.

660
00:30:55,322 --> 00:30:56,791
I don't know
if you remember that.

661
00:30:56,924 --> 00:30:58,359
I mean,
if you want to come over here

662
00:30:58,492 --> 00:30:59,927
and trade places with me,
that's--

663
00:31:00,060 --> 00:31:01,161
you can totally do that.

664
00:31:01,295 --> 00:31:02,930
I got out of the tub.

665
00:31:03,063 --> 00:31:04,865
And once you get out,
you can't go back in.

666
00:31:04,998 --> 00:31:06,467
That's it. 100%.

667
00:31:08,636 --> 00:31:12,206
Just, like,
this entitlement, all right?

668
00:31:13,307 --> 00:31:14,908
I don't know
where it comes from, you know?

669
00:31:15,309 --> 00:31:17,111
I mean, let's not forget

670
00:31:17,244 --> 00:31:18,580
that you're-- you're kind of
just doing a reality show

671
00:31:18,713 --> 00:31:20,815
that's going to be
on a little girl's iPad.

672
00:31:20,948 --> 00:31:23,016
-A dating show?
-Yeah, yeah.

673
00:31:23,150 --> 00:31:24,586
-I mean--
-Jonas, really?

674
00:31:24,719 --> 00:31:26,120
Yeah, he's gonna be,

675
00:31:26,253 --> 00:31:28,122
like, <i>The Bachelor</i>
or something, you know?

676
00:31:28,255 --> 00:31:29,624
Yeah. Like, I don't know.
Tell her, Jonas.

677
00:31:29,758 --> 00:31:31,425
I mean, I don't even know
what it is.

678
00:31:31,559 --> 00:31:34,094
No, I want to watch it.
Where can I see it?

679
00:31:34,228 --> 00:31:35,996
-I'll send you--
-Oh, you want to see it?

680
00:31:36,130 --> 00:31:37,832
That's-- that's
a great question, you know.

681
00:31:37,965 --> 00:31:39,601
My mom used to ask
the same thing.

682
00:31:40,033 --> 00:31:41,235
She'd always ask,
"Hey, Elliot,

683
00:31:41,368 --> 00:31:42,837
when's Jonas' show
going to be out?

684
00:31:43,303 --> 00:31:44,839
Elliot,
have you talked to Jonas?

685
00:31:44,972 --> 00:31:46,140
Did-- did Jonas text
you back yet?

686
00:31:46,273 --> 00:31:47,441
I haven't heard from Jonas."

687
00:31:47,575 --> 00:31:49,076
There were audio issues.

688
00:31:49,209 --> 00:31:51,278
That's--

689
00:31:52,614 --> 00:31:54,348
You guys don't get it,
there were...

690
00:31:54,915 --> 00:31:56,116
audio issues.

691
00:31:56,250 --> 00:31:57,519
That's-- that's the thing.

692
00:31:57,652 --> 00:31:58,853
They were the--
the mic wasn't working

693
00:31:58,986 --> 00:32:00,187
in the confessional room,

694
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:01,488
so that we have to
do reshoots.

695
00:32:01,623 --> 00:32:03,123
But it's gonna come out.

696
00:32:03,257 --> 00:32:04,692
I'll send you a link
or something when it's out.

697
00:32:04,826 --> 00:32:06,360
- It's bullshit, man.
- Don't call--

698
00:32:07,394 --> 00:32:09,631
That just sounds like bullshit,
man, I'm-- I'm sorry.

699
00:32:11,733 --> 00:32:13,267
Ellie, at least I got out.

700
00:32:14,736 --> 00:32:16,003
You didn't.

701
00:32:17,572 --> 00:32:18,640
Okay?

702
00:32:19,607 --> 00:32:21,408
I knew that I was meant
for great things.

703
00:32:21,543 --> 00:32:22,644
I knew...

704
00:32:23,944 --> 00:32:25,212
that I...

705
00:32:26,113 --> 00:32:28,148
that I was gonna do
something with my life.

706
00:32:28,282 --> 00:32:30,417
And Sonoma
wasn't gonna help me

707
00:32:30,552 --> 00:32:32,821
give the things
that I have to offer the world.

708
00:32:33,755 --> 00:32:36,490
I don't know, Jonas,
but what makes you so sure

709
00:32:36,624 --> 00:32:40,093
that what you have to offer
is what they want?

710
00:32:41,596 --> 00:32:42,697
Wow.

711
00:32:43,997 --> 00:32:45,733
Literally wow, Pigeon. Wow.

712
00:32:45,867 --> 00:32:48,168
No, no, no, you've shown
your true colors now, huh?

713
00:32:48,302 --> 00:32:49,671
No, I'm just saying,

714
00:32:49,804 --> 00:32:51,539
i-- it sounds like
you're blaming Sonoma

715
00:32:51,673 --> 00:32:54,208
for your success
or lack thereof it.

716
00:32:54,742 --> 00:32:56,611
And it just feels like
maybe in five years,

717
00:32:56,744 --> 00:32:59,714
you're going to sing the same
sad song about Los Angeles.

718
00:33:01,616 --> 00:33:02,817
Careful, Jonas.

719
00:33:02,951 --> 00:33:04,318
-Don't hatch an egg.
-I'm not.

720
00:33:07,956 --> 00:33:10,592
Look, I don't want to be rude,
but you don't get it, okay?

721
00:33:10,725 --> 00:33:12,092
You don't understand
this town.

722
00:33:12,226 --> 00:33:13,695
I'm trying
to understand it,

723
00:33:13,828 --> 00:33:15,630
because I feel like
if you can't be a big fish

724
00:33:15,763 --> 00:33:17,030
in a small town,

725
00:33:17,164 --> 00:33:18,733
ha-- it's only harder
to be a big fish

726
00:33:18,867 --> 00:33:20,133
in a bigger town.

727
00:33:20,267 --> 00:33:21,769
Like, as big
as the Mediterranean.

728
00:33:21,903 --> 00:33:23,505
Oh, you're right. You're right.
You don't understand it.

729
00:33:25,372 --> 00:33:27,274
Neither of you
understand it, okay?

730
00:33:29,476 --> 00:33:31,546
LA is the capital
of entertainment.

731
00:33:31,679 --> 00:33:33,748
A place where
I can actually thrive, okay?

732
00:33:33,882 --> 00:33:35,617
Can actually do
something with their lives.

733
00:33:35,750 --> 00:33:37,552
Not like Sonoma, where
the only thing that matters

734
00:33:37,685 --> 00:33:39,353
is when-- when your grapes
turn into wine or whatever.

735
00:33:39,486 --> 00:33:40,989
I mean,
you don't really know

736
00:33:41,154 --> 00:33:42,489
what was going on here
nowadays, man.

737
00:33:43,290 --> 00:33:45,392
You know, like,
you weren't here for the fires.

738
00:33:45,527 --> 00:33:47,394
And you weren't here
for quarantine.

739
00:33:48,763 --> 00:33:51,766
I mean, I kind of think
what's going on in Sonoma

740
00:33:51,900 --> 00:33:53,568
is kind of like
what you've been missing.

741
00:33:53,968 --> 00:33:56,671
Weren't you the one
that just a second ago

742
00:33:56,804 --> 00:33:58,438
was complaining
about all these yuppies

743
00:33:58,573 --> 00:34:01,141
moving and wanting to
enjoy their life, huh?

744
00:34:02,175 --> 00:34:03,678
-It's--
-Exactly. No.

745
00:34:03,811 --> 00:34:05,479
It's different, it's different
because there's--

746
00:34:05,613 --> 00:34:08,616
-How is that different?
-No one's perfect, Jonas.

747
00:34:09,349 --> 00:34:10,552
There's ebbs and flows.

748
00:34:10,685 --> 00:34:12,286
No one's perfect.
Ebbs and flows.

749
00:34:12,419 --> 00:34:15,355
Look, you-- all you do
is defend this life.

750
00:34:15,489 --> 00:34:16,991
This Slownoma life.

751
00:34:17,124 --> 00:34:19,627
You-- but you wear it
as a shield to protect yourself

752
00:34:19,761 --> 00:34:22,062
so that nobody
can see the real you.

753
00:34:22,630 --> 00:34:23,865
I don't care.

754
00:34:23,998 --> 00:34:25,232
A lion doesn't have to
tell you it's a lion.

755
00:34:25,365 --> 00:34:27,134
100%. That's it.

756
00:34:29,037 --> 00:34:31,405
This is a comfortable life.
This is the example.

757
00:34:32,205 --> 00:34:33,575
I can see it right now.

758
00:34:34,876 --> 00:34:37,045
Right there. You see that?
That's Broadway.

759
00:34:37,411 --> 00:34:38,680
And Broadway,
they named it that,

760
00:34:38,813 --> 00:34:41,516
because every big city
has a Broadway.

761
00:34:41,983 --> 00:34:44,251
But it's just a farce here,
because this isn't a big city.

762
00:34:44,384 --> 00:34:45,452
It's just pretending.

763
00:34:45,587 --> 00:34:47,021
But, hey, that-- that Plaza's

764
00:34:47,154 --> 00:34:48,823
got some attractions, right?

765
00:34:48,957 --> 00:34:52,594
You know, you have 4th of July,
and you got, uh, uh, Ellie here,

766
00:34:52,727 --> 00:34:56,064
uh, his home away from home,
Pizza Shack.

767
00:34:56,196 --> 00:34:58,700
Where he's at all day,
every day.

768
00:34:59,466 --> 00:35:01,936
But hey, you guys got
farmers markets, right?

769
00:35:02,402 --> 00:35:03,738
That's pretty cool.

770
00:35:03,871 --> 00:35:05,807
You guys can, uh,
use the farmers markets,

771
00:35:05,940 --> 00:35:08,241
which happen once a week,
to remember what day it is,

772
00:35:08,375 --> 00:35:09,744
because you guys are stuck
in this ghost town.

773
00:35:09,877 --> 00:35:12,547
Or you can go
to Boyes Hot Springs.

774
00:35:14,381 --> 00:35:15,750
A tourist trap.

775
00:35:17,619 --> 00:35:19,587
But they do have,
right next to it,

776
00:35:19,721 --> 00:35:22,023
the best Mexican food
you'll ever have.

777
00:35:22,155 --> 00:35:23,490
Which is not bad.

778
00:35:23,625 --> 00:35:25,325
I mean, I've been in LA
for a long time

779
00:35:25,459 --> 00:35:27,929
and I-- I still haven't had
a burrito that good.

780
00:35:28,830 --> 00:35:32,265
But everything
is on this stretch of road

781
00:35:32,399 --> 00:35:33,601
that they--
that they had the balls

782
00:35:33,735 --> 00:35:35,469
to call a highway
for some reason,

783
00:35:35,637 --> 00:35:37,672
it doesn't make any sense
because it's just a road.

784
00:35:40,675 --> 00:35:42,010
A lot of people,
you know,

785
00:35:42,142 --> 00:35:43,711
for fun,
to get away from it all,

786
00:35:43,845 --> 00:35:45,113
they bring a keg up

787
00:35:45,245 --> 00:35:46,648
and they have
a big kegger and...

788
00:35:48,181 --> 00:35:49,717
bring it into the mountains.

789
00:35:49,851 --> 00:35:52,152
And maybe-- maybe that keg
will roll over on them,

790
00:35:52,285 --> 00:35:53,788
or they'll fall off
the-- the cliff,

791
00:35:53,921 --> 00:35:55,288
or they'll get eaten
by a mountain lion or something

792
00:35:55,422 --> 00:35:56,724
and they'll die.

793
00:35:56,858 --> 00:35:58,425
And then they'll end up
in Sonoma Cemetery

794
00:35:58,559 --> 00:36:00,193
and be here eternally.

795
00:36:00,327 --> 00:36:01,663
Stuck.

796
00:36:03,097 --> 00:36:05,198
Which is no different
than anybody else here.

797
00:36:09,169 --> 00:36:12,040
And Pigeon, if you are looking
so hard for a time capsule,

798
00:36:12,172 --> 00:36:14,408
you don't have to look
any further because that's it.

799
00:36:19,781 --> 00:36:23,417
He left home
when he was a child.

800
00:36:25,185 --> 00:36:28,690
Early on,
he grew tired outside.

801
00:36:29,724 --> 00:36:32,794
And his parents
talked and talked.

802
00:36:33,193 --> 00:36:36,130
He just left
like a dark goodbye.

803
00:36:37,098 --> 00:36:40,902
He became a wanderer
and his plan was this.

804
00:36:41,903 --> 00:36:44,572
To leave the solitude
that pampered him

805
00:36:45,006 --> 00:36:49,544
and to join those
whose days are drowned in sound.

806
00:36:51,311 --> 00:36:53,781
To approach someone,

807
00:36:53,915 --> 00:36:56,450
one us with the sea.

Oh, look at this, Jonas.

820
00:38:16,130 --> 00:38:18,132
- Jonas, you see this?
- Yeah.

821
00:38:19,133 --> 00:38:20,802
Come on.
You remember this guy?

822
00:38:22,469 --> 00:38:24,371
-From camp?
-Yeah.

823
00:38:24,505 --> 00:38:25,840
You don't remember
this from camp?

824
00:38:25,973 --> 00:38:27,275
No, not really.

825
00:38:27,407 --> 00:38:28,676
-What?
-That was, like, 20 years ago.

826
00:38:29,043 --> 00:38:31,913
20 years ago? Come on.
How could you forget this?

827
00:38:32,046 --> 00:38:34,381
-I don't know.
-It's like a platform.

828
00:38:34,515 --> 00:38:35,983
That's kind of
like a stage, right?

829
00:38:36,117 --> 00:38:37,185
Yeah.

830
00:38:37,685 --> 00:38:39,386
Yeah.

831
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:41,222
-There you go.
-Yeah.

832
00:38:42,657 --> 00:38:44,391
Hey, wait,
remember when Mom,

833
00:38:45,159 --> 00:38:47,695
uh, took us to a Springsteen
concert when we were younger?

834
00:38:47,829 --> 00:38:49,362
Oh, yeah,
are you kidding me?

835
00:38:49,496 --> 00:38:50,565
That was, like,
the best night of my life.

836
00:38:50,698 --> 00:38:51,966
That was incredible.

837
00:38:52,099 --> 00:38:53,366
Oh, I-- I remember we were,
like--

838
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:54,869
like, she got us seats

839
00:38:55,002 --> 00:38:57,004
right behind the stage,
and she was nervous.

840
00:38:57,138 --> 00:38:58,639
We were all nervous.

841
00:38:58,773 --> 00:39:00,541
'Cause, like, yeah, Springsteen
was faced behind us.

842
00:39:00,675 --> 00:39:02,342
And-- But he would turn around
every once in a while

843
00:39:02,475 --> 00:39:04,779
- and be like--
- Hey.

844
00:39:04,912 --> 00:39:06,314
He'd point right at us.
Remember?

845
00:39:06,446 --> 00:39:08,015
He pointed at us,
like, six times.

846
00:39:08,149 --> 00:39:10,383
And that guy right behind us
got so jelly.

847
00:39:10,518 --> 00:39:12,352
Yeah, it was wild.

848
00:39:12,485 --> 00:39:13,754
Remember he put
his head in the water

849
00:39:13,888 --> 00:39:15,189
and ate the sponge
and everything?

850
00:39:15,323 --> 00:39:17,592
-That was crazy.
-It was amazing.

851
00:39:18,559 --> 00:39:19,827
-Yeah.
-Wait, this is--

852
00:39:20,661 --> 00:39:21,929
I remember this now,

853
00:39:22,063 --> 00:39:23,331
this is where
we would line up, right?

854
00:39:23,463 --> 00:39:24,866
And one at a time,

855
00:39:24,999 --> 00:39:26,466
he would come up
and-- and, uh, do that thing.

856
00:39:26,601 --> 00:39:27,835
What's that thing?

857
00:39:27,969 --> 00:39:29,337
Oh, you're talking about
the trust fall?

858
00:39:29,469 --> 00:39:30,838
- Yeah, yeah.
- Yeah.

859
00:39:30,972 --> 00:39:32,640
Do you guys
want to do it right now?

860
00:39:32,773 --> 00:39:34,108
- No. What are you doing?
- What do you mean?

861
00:39:34,242 --> 00:39:36,677
Okay, what happens
is I'm going to go back.

862
00:39:36,811 --> 00:39:39,146
No, no,
we're not going to--

863
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:40,681
Please don't do it.

864
00:39:40,815 --> 00:39:42,316
- Ready? Three.
- Jonas, no, no, no.

865
00:39:42,449 --> 00:39:43,818
I'm going to fall.
I trust you guys.

866
00:39:43,951 --> 00:39:45,786
- Three. Two.
- Jonas. Please, no. No.

867
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:49,156
-No one's gonna catch you, man.
-No, not now. Not right now.

868
00:39:49,290 --> 00:39:50,625
Wow.
Good to know.

869
00:39:50,758 --> 00:39:52,392
Good to know
I can't trust on you guys.

870
00:39:52,894 --> 00:39:54,862
But how, uh--

871
00:39:54,996 --> 00:39:57,098
You remember
this classic, right?

872
00:39:57,732 --> 00:39:58,933
You remember this one?

873
00:39:59,066 --> 00:40:01,535
-What is it?
-One, two, three.

874
00:40:01,669 --> 00:40:04,672

We'll start over. Let's get it,
let's get it. Ready?

878
00:40:09,510 --> 00:40:10,945

Yeah,
that's not a problem.

903
00:41:12,039 --> 00:41:13,641
You're collecting those?

904
00:41:14,442 --> 00:41:15,776
Yeah,
I was thinking

905
00:41:15,910 --> 00:41:17,645
of making
some bonsai trees, you know.

906
00:41:17,778 --> 00:41:20,514
You can almost make a bonsai
out of anything.

907
00:41:20,648 --> 00:41:22,049
Even avocado pits.

908
00:41:22,583 --> 00:41:25,586
Avocado bonsai?

909
00:41:25,720 --> 00:41:27,521
- Mm-hmm.
- LOL.

910
00:41:27,655 --> 00:41:29,223
It only takes,
like, four to six weeks

911
00:41:29,357 --> 00:41:30,391
to germinate, it's all.

912
00:41:30,524 --> 00:41:31,792
Huh.

913
00:41:31,926 --> 00:41:34,161
And, you know,
before I left Singapore,

914
00:41:34,295 --> 00:41:36,897
uh, I saw some roots
coming out of the crack

915
00:41:37,031 --> 00:41:38,899
of the avocado pit
I planted,

916
00:41:39,033 --> 00:41:42,003
so I can't wait to go back
and see how that's growing.

917
00:41:47,408 --> 00:41:50,344
You know, Sonoma
really has a lot of potential.

918
00:41:50,745 --> 00:41:52,847
You guys are so lucky
to be from here.

919
00:41:53,514 --> 00:41:55,716
Uh, I don't know
about all that.

920
00:41:56,884 --> 00:41:58,552
I mean, yeah, we have,
like, good hikes and stuff,

921
00:41:58,686 --> 00:42:01,689
but you guys have pretty cool
hikes in, uh, Singapore, right?

922
00:42:02,056 --> 00:42:04,725
Uh, it's only 1% forest,
so not really.

923
00:42:05,860 --> 00:42:08,029
-You say 1%?
-Mm-hmm.

924
00:42:09,096 --> 00:42:10,197
Cringe.

925
00:42:13,901 --> 00:42:16,137
You-- you didn't really
mean that right there

926
00:42:16,270 --> 00:42:19,607
when you said Sonoma being
like a lukewarm bathtub, right?

927
00:42:20,474 --> 00:42:22,977
I totally meant that, 100%.

928
00:42:23,110 --> 00:42:25,713
You're into someone
who's thinking of staying.

929
00:42:27,248 --> 00:42:29,683
-You're not serious, are you?
-No, considering.

930
00:42:31,552 --> 00:42:32,753
All right.

931
00:42:33,120 --> 00:42:34,622
I mean, if you want to
clip your little wings

932
00:42:34,755 --> 00:42:36,457
and coop up here,
that's on you.

933
00:42:36,590 --> 00:42:40,327
But, I mean, you didn't grow
up here, so I, um-- I get it.

934
00:42:40,761 --> 00:42:42,797
But what about Elliot?

935
00:42:43,764 --> 00:42:45,199
-Ellie?
-Mm-hmm.

936
00:42:46,901 --> 00:42:49,603
Boy,
if your wings are clipped,

937
00:42:49,737 --> 00:42:51,305
then that guy's are, uh--

938
00:42:53,340 --> 00:42:55,042
I don't know,
I shouldn't say anything.

939
00:42:55,176 --> 00:42:56,343
Say what?

940
00:42:56,744 --> 00:42:59,380
I-- I love him.
He's-- he's my baby brother.

941
00:42:59,514 --> 00:43:00,614
I just--

942
00:43:01,482 --> 00:43:04,085
I mean, he's been working
at the same Pizza Shack

943
00:43:04,553 --> 00:43:05,786
uh, since high school,

944
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:07,154
he just goes in
day in and day out,

945
00:43:07,288 --> 00:43:09,156
over and over again,
and I-- I--

946
00:43:10,724 --> 00:43:12,359
That's unutilized potential.

947
00:43:12,893 --> 00:43:15,196
Pizza Shack?
Like the Pizza Man?

948
00:43:16,230 --> 00:43:18,099
Yes,
just like the Pizza Man.

949
00:43:18,232 --> 00:43:21,702
I think-- think he must have
read into that song too hard,

950
00:43:22,636 --> 00:43:24,371
-Hmm.
-But he's just--

951
00:43:25,973 --> 00:43:27,608
I don't know,
if he doesn't leave soon,

952
00:43:27,741 --> 00:43:28,809
they're going to put

953
00:43:29,343 --> 00:43:31,645
"Pizza Man"
on his tombstone, and--

954
00:43:31,779 --> 00:43:33,147
and he's too smart
for that, you know?

955
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:36,784
He's-- he's the smartest
dumbass that I know.

956
00:43:37,118 --> 00:43:39,353
And he has more heart
than everybody combined.

957
00:43:39,487 --> 00:43:40,855
I-- I--

958
00:43:41,956 --> 00:43:44,091
-Do you ever tell him that?
-No.

959
00:43:46,026 --> 00:43:47,928
Like, I-- I can't,
'cause you...

960
00:43:48,629 --> 00:43:50,297
you can't fix somebody

961
00:43:50,431 --> 00:43:54,401
who feels like they have to
solve everything all the time.

962
00:43:55,002 --> 00:43:57,705
Like, who said anything
about fixing?

963
00:44:09,650 --> 00:44:12,521
No, that's perfect.
I, uh, I really appreciate it.

964
00:44:12,653 --> 00:44:14,755
So, Miss Barnes, uh,
has the address,

965
00:44:14,889 --> 00:44:16,824
and she'll just
get in touch with you, okay?

966
00:44:16,957 --> 00:44:18,560
- No-- no way.
- All right.

967
00:44:18,692 --> 00:44:21,428
- Have a good one. Goodbye.
- Are you kidding me?

968
00:44:22,597 --> 00:44:24,165
This is so sick.

969
00:44:24,899 --> 00:44:26,333
This is it.
This is lit.

970
00:44:26,467 --> 00:44:28,702
This is, uh--
I'm-- I'm speechless.

971
00:44:28,836 --> 00:44:30,738
This is so serene.

972
00:44:31,772 --> 00:44:33,874
This is perfect
for a video, man.

973
00:44:34,842 --> 00:44:36,143
Ellie, Ellie,

974
00:44:36,277 --> 00:44:37,711
take a video of me
real quick, okay?

975
00:44:37,845 --> 00:44:39,213
Just take that,
and make-- make sure

976
00:44:39,346 --> 00:44:41,248
it's vertical, though,
'cause, like,

977
00:44:41,382 --> 00:44:43,951
-you know how it goes.
-Yeah, I don't think so, man.

978
00:44:44,084 --> 00:44:46,120
No, 'cause, like, horizontal
doesn't work on Instagram.

979
00:44:46,253 --> 00:44:48,856
So just let me do one of these,
like, "Hey, guys."

980
00:44:48,989 --> 00:44:50,858
Jonas,
I'm not filming you.

981
00:44:55,496 --> 00:44:56,565
Why?

982
00:44:57,431 --> 00:44:59,266
I just don't want to
contribute.

983
00:45:00,100 --> 00:45:01,636
You know, this
isn't gonna be any different

984
00:45:01,769 --> 00:45:03,237
from any of your last videos.

985
00:45:03,370 --> 00:45:05,839
And, I don't know,
suddenly, Sonoma's lit for you?

986
00:45:06,440 --> 00:45:08,543
Like, all day
you've been trashing it.

987
00:45:08,677 --> 00:45:09,843
Now it's amazing?

988
00:45:10,211 --> 00:45:12,413
Is that how fake
TikTok is?

989
00:45:12,547 --> 00:45:13,814
I guess you guys just do

990
00:45:13,948 --> 00:45:15,082
whatever the next trend is,
right?

991
00:45:15,550 --> 00:45:16,651
Ellie, do--

992
00:45:17,451 --> 00:45:19,086
Do you think
you're better than me?

993
00:45:20,821 --> 00:45:23,390
No, I--
I don't think I'm--

994
00:45:24,559 --> 00:45:26,427
No, I don't think
I'm better than you.

995
00:45:26,561 --> 00:45:28,630
I just don't want to
contribute, that's it.

996
00:45:28,762 --> 00:45:31,232
You can,
but you won't.

997
00:45:31,666 --> 00:45:33,334
And that's the thing,
it's the same thing

998
00:45:33,467 --> 00:45:34,768
with-- with-- with
the trust fall and now this.

999
00:45:34,902 --> 00:45:36,170
It's, like,

1000
00:45:36,303 --> 00:45:38,038
won't even just
help me out a tiny bit.

1001
00:45:39,006 --> 00:45:41,342
Yeah, but you won't come
to Mom's funeral.

1002
00:45:46,847 --> 00:45:48,249
I should have expected this.

1003
00:45:49,416 --> 00:45:51,352
I-- I'm just asking you
to do something for me

1004
00:45:51,485 --> 00:45:52,786
that takes ten seconds.

1005
00:45:52,920 --> 00:45:54,788
I was just trying
to have fun, man.

1006
00:45:58,526 --> 00:46:00,261
What, you're going to
shrug your shoulders?

1007
00:46:00,394 --> 00:46:02,162
Just stop being a bitch
and take the video, all right?

1008
00:46:02,296 --> 00:46:03,931
Paloma, can you help me
real quick?

1009
00:46:04,064 --> 00:46:05,734
-It will only take a second.
-No, no, no, no.

1010
00:46:05,866 --> 00:46:07,736
-Please don't drag her down--
-What is your problem, man?

1011
00:46:07,868 --> 00:46:09,638
Why can't you just help me,
your brother, with one thing?

1012
00:46:09,770 --> 00:46:11,872
No, no, my problem is,
is just that not everything's

1013
00:46:12,006 --> 00:46:13,440
meant to be shared, Jonas.

1014
00:46:13,575 --> 00:46:15,677
Like, you think
I didn't hear you earlier today

1015
00:46:15,809 --> 00:46:17,378
before we even started
this hike?

1016
00:46:17,945 --> 00:46:19,780
I mean, I just want to
do this send-off.

1017
00:46:19,913 --> 00:46:21,750
And not on my phone
the whole time.

1018
00:46:21,882 --> 00:46:23,250
Not on your phone, okay?

1019
00:46:23,384 --> 00:46:25,052
-Please, just respect that.
-Wasn't that you

1020
00:46:25,185 --> 00:46:26,787
just a second ago
making phone calls and shit?

1021
00:46:26,920 --> 00:46:28,590
You know, that-- that was pretty
sus if you ask me, right?

1022
00:46:28,723 --> 00:46:30,891
That's different,
'cause it's business, okay?

1023
00:46:31,025 --> 00:46:32,359
So is this.

1024
00:46:32,493 --> 00:46:33,927
No, the business
that you're talking about

1025
00:46:34,061 --> 00:46:35,396
is just self-indulgent.

1026
00:46:35,530 --> 00:46:37,632
It's like
narcissistic behavior, okay?

1027
00:46:37,766 --> 00:46:40,100
It's toxic.
It's TikToxic.

1028
00:46:40,234 --> 00:46:42,269
This is how
I make money, okay?

1029
00:46:42,403 --> 00:46:44,004
This is a real,
true business.

1030
00:46:44,138 --> 00:46:45,306
How do you think
I got this jacket?

1031
00:46:45,439 --> 00:46:46,840
-This is endorsements.
-Yeah.

1032
00:46:46,974 --> 00:46:48,208
I hope they gave you
a receipt.

1033
00:46:48,342 --> 00:46:49,810
Why would they give me
a receipt?

1034
00:46:50,244 --> 00:46:51,579
Like the sunglasses I have.

1035
00:46:51,713 --> 00:46:52,980
If I do one more post,

1036
00:46:53,113 --> 00:46:54,448
these are going to pay
for themselves.

1037
00:46:54,582 --> 00:46:56,817
It's...
...it's that simple.

1038
00:46:57,585 --> 00:47:00,888
You're-- you're profiting
off of Mom's send-off?

1039
00:47:03,390 --> 00:47:05,893
-Are you serious?
-No. I--

1040
00:47:07,629 --> 00:47:09,096
What would Mom think?

1041
00:47:10,831 --> 00:47:13,901
Look, Mom would have been
cool with it, okay?

1042
00:47:14,335 --> 00:47:16,270
She always supported me,
unlike...

1043
00:47:17,037 --> 00:47:18,640
unlike some people
in the family.

1044
00:47:18,773 --> 00:47:20,474
Okay, you-- listen,
Mom would've supported you

1045
00:47:20,608 --> 00:47:23,678
if you had a tattoo of Nixon
on your face, Jonas.

1046
00:47:24,111 --> 00:47:25,580
I mean, if we were

1047
00:47:25,714 --> 00:47:27,515
at that Bruce Springsteen
concert today, man,

1048
00:47:27,649 --> 00:47:29,249
I-- I-- I could see you now,
you'd have a selfie stick.

1049
00:47:29,383 --> 00:47:31,786
You'd be filming yourself
at a concert.

1050
00:47:31,919 --> 00:47:33,487
You know,
if you film everything,

1051
00:47:33,621 --> 00:47:35,289
not everything's sacred, man,
I'm just saying that.

1052
00:47:35,724 --> 00:47:37,559
You know, like,
be here now, like Ram Dass?

1053
00:47:37,692 --> 00:47:40,127
I have no idea
what you're talking about, okay?

1054
00:47:40,260 --> 00:47:41,962
You just say these names
all the time.

1055
00:47:42,530 --> 00:47:44,498
You're being so serious
about something

1056
00:47:44,632 --> 00:47:46,433
that's just
supposed to be fun.

1057
00:47:46,568 --> 00:47:47,602
The Internet is fun--

1058
00:47:47,736 --> 00:47:48,770
It's all fun and games, man,

1059
00:47:48,902 --> 00:47:50,104
until you bring Mom into it.

1060
00:47:51,138 --> 00:47:52,507
And what about her?

1061
00:47:52,906 --> 00:47:55,442
It's okay to share Mom's death
with a complete stranger,

1062
00:47:55,577 --> 00:47:58,045
but I can't share her death
with my fans,

1063
00:47:58,178 --> 00:47:59,581
the people that care about me?

1064
00:47:59,714 --> 00:48:01,616
- That follow me?
- Oh, come on, man.

1065
00:48:01,750 --> 00:48:04,985
When we literally have
a complete stranger right there?

1066
00:48:05,119 --> 00:48:06,487
-What-- what about her?
-Look, man.

1067
00:48:06,621 --> 00:48:08,222
It's-- it's different
with Paloma, okay?

1068
00:48:08,355 --> 00:48:10,525
Like, meeting her,
that was an accident.

1069
00:48:11,024 --> 00:48:12,527
A happy accident.

1070
00:48:13,160 --> 00:48:14,662
Unlike you, man,
everything you do

1071
00:48:14,796 --> 00:48:17,565
it's self-- self-brought-on,
it's premeditated.

1072
00:48:17,699 --> 00:48:18,966
Premeditated.

1073
00:48:19,099 --> 00:48:20,134
I mean, you remember
what Mom said?

1074
00:48:20,702 --> 00:48:22,269
I-- I'm sure
I'm about to find out.

1075
00:48:22,403 --> 00:48:24,905
"No sympathy
for the self-inflicted wounds."

1076
00:48:28,676 --> 00:48:29,943
It's funny, 'cause I-- I--

1077
00:48:30,812 --> 00:48:32,012
I do remember that.

1078
00:48:32,146 --> 00:48:33,380
I remember, that was...

1079
00:48:33,947 --> 00:48:36,984
that was, uh, right after you
got your first hangover, right?

1080
00:48:37,117 --> 00:48:38,986
When you were, uh,
on your hands and knees

1081
00:48:39,119 --> 00:48:40,755
in front of the toilet,

1082
00:48:40,889 --> 00:48:43,223
and you were puking all day,
and you were like, "Oh, God.

1083
00:48:43,357 --> 00:48:46,059
Oh, please.
Oh, I'm so sick.

1084
00:48:46,193 --> 00:48:48,362
Poor me. Poor me."

1085
00:48:49,163 --> 00:48:50,799
You know, you should
actually film that.

1086
00:48:50,931 --> 00:48:52,634
Like, that would be a good
sketch for TikTok or whatever.

1087
00:48:52,767 --> 00:48:54,468
You could be a real influencer
in a second, man.

1088
00:48:54,602 --> 00:48:56,069
Yeah,
I'd rather do anything else

1089
00:48:56,203 --> 00:48:57,471
but do what you do.

1090
00:48:57,605 --> 00:48:59,306
As long as I still have
my pride intact.

1091
00:49:00,207 --> 00:49:02,109
Yeah, there's a lot of
pride in pizza.

1092
00:49:04,913 --> 00:49:07,214
You know, sometimes when
I'm watching these videos, man,

1093
00:49:07,347 --> 00:49:08,516
I don't even recognize you,

1094
00:49:08,683 --> 00:49:09,950
you know,
it's like, in your eyes.

1095
00:49:10,718 --> 00:49:12,453
You know,
it's like someone different.

1096
00:49:13,053 --> 00:49:14,589
It's--
it's not my brother.

1097
00:49:18,660 --> 00:49:19,993
You just don't get it.

1098
00:49:22,129 --> 00:49:23,798
Truly, I mean,
you-- you don't understand

1099
00:49:23,932 --> 00:49:25,365
what it's like in LA.

1100
00:49:26,601 --> 00:49:27,968
I dial myself.

1101
00:49:28,101 --> 00:49:29,637
Like, everybody,
everybody has that little dial,

1102
00:49:29,771 --> 00:49:31,338
and, you know,
they fit themselves

1103
00:49:31,472 --> 00:49:33,675
to the situation they're in,
I-- you do, too.

1104
00:49:35,442 --> 00:49:37,579
When you're at work
at the Pizza Shack,

1105
00:49:37,712 --> 00:49:40,782
you're not the same person
that you are here, right?

1106
00:49:41,181 --> 00:49:42,483
Am I wrong?

1107
00:49:43,250 --> 00:49:45,887
So I dial myself
to "Jonas with the Mostest,"

1108
00:49:46,019 --> 00:49:47,555
and then, you know,
when I'm here,

1109
00:49:48,288 --> 00:49:50,692
I'm dialing myself to--
to fit this situation

1110
00:49:50,825 --> 00:49:52,459
so that I can have fun
with my baby bro,

1111
00:49:52,594 --> 00:49:54,629
which is what I thought
this day was going to be.

1112
00:49:55,663 --> 00:49:58,198
You know,
we could send Mom off right.

1113
00:49:59,366 --> 00:50:01,268
Figure out
the affairs with the house,

1114
00:50:01,401 --> 00:50:03,505
and-- and I just don't know
what the big deal is,

1115
00:50:03,638 --> 00:50:06,106
and why you take
this shit so hard.

1116
00:50:09,644 --> 00:50:12,614
I ju-- I just care about you.
That-- that's all this is.

1117
00:50:14,616 --> 00:50:16,584
Well,
despite what you think...

1118
00:50:17,952 --> 00:50:20,922
the video of Mom today
is doing really well.

1119
00:50:21,054 --> 00:50:22,322
It kind of blew up.

1120
00:50:25,359 --> 00:50:27,094
I bet you can't go
the rest of the day

1121
00:50:27,227 --> 00:50:28,295
without being on your phone.

1122
00:50:28,730 --> 00:50:30,297
Want to
make it interesting?

1123
00:50:31,533 --> 00:50:33,300
Wh-- what?
You want to put money on it?

1124
00:50:33,433 --> 00:50:35,670
-Yes, do a bet, come on.
-Okay, $20.

1125
00:50:36,036 --> 00:50:37,471
50.

1126
00:50:37,839 --> 00:50:40,508
- All right.
- Deal. Bet.

1127
00:50:40,909 --> 00:50:42,242
$50.

1128
00:50:44,979 --> 00:50:46,280
Paloma.

1129
00:50:47,214 --> 00:50:48,516
Paloma?

1130
00:51:05,733 --> 00:51:06,834
Paloma.

1131
00:51:07,334 --> 00:51:09,737
Hey, Paloma, hey.

1132
00:51:10,270 --> 00:51:11,606
You don't know
where you're going.

1133
00:51:11,739 --> 00:51:13,007
That may be true,

1134
00:51:13,140 --> 00:51:14,408
but I'm just
through with you two.

1135
00:51:14,776 --> 00:51:17,812
What? What?
What are you talking about?

1136
00:51:28,488 --> 00:51:30,858
My brother was killed
in a car accident.

1137
00:51:32,225 --> 00:51:34,394
Like, hit and run,
just like that.

1138
00:51:36,831 --> 00:51:39,266
You know what I would give
to be with him again?

1139
00:51:39,667 --> 00:51:43,337
Here or anywhere,
for that matter.

1140
00:51:44,973 --> 00:51:48,475
This trip was supposed to be
for him and only him.

1141
00:51:49,844 --> 00:51:53,480
But here I am with you two,
and what do you do?

1142
00:51:53,615 --> 00:51:56,884
You just keep barking
and fighting with each other.

1143
00:51:57,819 --> 00:52:01,188
You-- you have a chance
to bond as brothers,

1144
00:52:01,321 --> 00:52:03,691
to send off your mother
the way she wished.

1145
00:52:04,257 --> 00:52:05,693
But-- but instead,
this is turning

1146
00:52:05,827 --> 00:52:08,295
into some, like,
deranged competition.

1147
00:52:08,428 --> 00:52:10,632
I don't even know
what to call it.

1148
00:52:12,132 --> 00:52:13,868
Love?
Do you call this love?

1149
00:52:17,572 --> 00:52:19,741
I just can't take it anymore.

1150
00:52:21,542 --> 00:52:25,278
I'm just going to go
find my time capsule by myself.

1151
00:52:25,412 --> 00:52:26,748
Thank you, uh,

1152
00:52:26,881 --> 00:52:29,483
wherever
this body of water may be.

1153
00:53:11,959 --> 00:53:13,226
We did it, Mom.

1154
00:53:14,428 --> 00:53:15,663
We made it.

1155
00:53:16,798 --> 00:53:20,233
One way or another,
we made it in one piece.

1156
00:53:22,704 --> 00:53:26,239
You know, I know I'm going to
forget something 'cause...

1157
00:53:27,508 --> 00:53:29,476
I just always
forget something.

1158
00:53:30,578 --> 00:53:32,747
But whatever
I'm going to say,

1159
00:53:32,880 --> 00:53:34,381
I'm sure it was already said
at the funeral,

1160
00:53:34,515 --> 00:53:35,850
so I'm just going to say it.

1161
00:53:41,823 --> 00:53:43,958
I'm really happy
I could do this for you.

1162
00:53:47,128 --> 00:53:48,328
And we could send you off

1163
00:53:48,462 --> 00:53:49,897
right here
at your lake, you know?

1164
00:53:52,867 --> 00:53:53,935
Together.

1165
00:53:58,873 --> 00:54:01,341
I miss you, Mom.
And I love you.

1166
00:54:04,045 --> 00:54:05,312
I love you a lot.

1167
00:54:13,955 --> 00:54:15,022
Goodbye.

1168
00:54:30,505 --> 00:54:32,940
Um...

1169
00:54:34,709 --> 00:54:36,443
Hi, Mom.

1170
00:54:39,247 --> 00:54:40,581
I'm here.

1171
00:54:44,484 --> 00:54:46,419
And I don't really know
what to say.

1172
00:54:48,723 --> 00:54:50,457
Um...

1173
00:54:52,325 --> 00:54:53,761
You were the best mom

1174
00:54:53,895 --> 00:54:55,830
that anyone
could've hoped for.

1175
00:55:00,768 --> 00:55:02,970
And you were always
there for me.

1176
00:55:07,041 --> 00:55:09,644
And I wasn't always
there for you.

1177
00:55:15,817 --> 00:55:16,918
I'm sorry.

1178
00:55:17,852 --> 00:55:19,754
I'm sorry
I wasn't a better son.

1179
00:55:21,989 --> 00:55:23,390
I'm sorry...

1180
00:55:24,592 --> 00:55:26,661
I wasn't around more often.

1181
00:55:27,360 --> 00:55:29,496
And, um, I don't know,

1182
00:55:29,630 --> 00:55:31,098
I just want you to know
that you...

1183
00:55:32,867 --> 00:55:34,836
...you were always--
always in my thoughts,

1184
00:55:34,969 --> 00:55:36,804
and-- and you were
in my heart.

1185
00:55:41,809 --> 00:55:45,079
You know, being a biggest fan
works both ways, right?

1186
00:55:45,513 --> 00:55:46,781
Yeah.

1187
00:55:58,125 --> 00:55:59,426
You, uh...

1188
00:56:00,393 --> 00:56:01,662
you have...

1189
00:56:03,097 --> 00:56:04,397
my whole heart.

1190
00:56:05,766 --> 00:56:07,201
And I know--
I know you're around.

1191
00:56:07,335 --> 00:56:08,603
I know you're here.

1192
00:56:09,436 --> 00:56:11,038
I know
you're here with me.

1193
00:56:11,672 --> 00:56:13,841
And you're here with Ellie,
and you--

1194
00:56:14,976 --> 00:56:17,044
you brought us back together
again for this.

1195
00:56:17,178 --> 00:56:19,680
And I'm-- I'm so thankful.

1196
00:56:35,596 --> 00:56:36,864
I love you...

1197
00:56:40,201 --> 00:56:43,638
so much, and thank you
for-- for everything.

1198
00:57:35,423 --> 00:57:38,859
One, two, three.

1199
00:57:47,234 --> 00:57:49,270
Yeah!

1200
00:57:52,273 --> 00:57:56,711
Mom!

1201
00:57:58,713 --> 00:58:00,014
Love you, Mom.

1202
00:58:02,650 --> 00:58:03,918
Love you.

1203
00:58:08,823 --> 00:58:11,392
Duncan, my man.
What's up?

1204
00:58:11,525 --> 00:58:13,060
Did you, uh,

1205
00:58:13,194 --> 00:58:15,162
did you have a good time
at those meetings?

1206
00:58:15,296 --> 00:58:17,131
So, yeah, that's why
I-- I called, actually.

1207
00:58:17,264 --> 00:58:18,566
I wanted to, um--

1208
00:58:22,236 --> 00:58:23,704
Duncan, uh--

1209
00:58:36,450 --> 00:58:37,752
Uh...

1210
00:58:53,467 --> 00:58:54,902
Fuck!

1211
00:58:56,137 --> 00:58:58,139
What's up?
Jonas. What's up?

1212
00:58:58,272 --> 00:58:59,740
You good? You good?

1213
00:59:01,275 --> 00:59:03,277
Jonas, what's going on, man?
Talk to me.

1214
00:59:10,751 --> 00:59:13,821
Hey guys, it's me, uh,
Jonas with the Mostest,

1215
00:59:13,954 --> 00:59:16,023
your, uh-- your boy.

1216
00:59:16,157 --> 00:59:18,926
I'm, uh,
still out in Slownoma.

1217
00:59:19,360 --> 00:59:21,662
Look at this.
It's a really nice lake.

1218
00:59:21,796 --> 00:59:24,398
Very cool, just spread
my mom's ashes into it.

1219
00:59:24,765 --> 00:59:25,933
Or scattered,
I'm not really sure

1220
00:59:26,067 --> 00:59:27,635
of the difference.

1221
00:59:27,768 --> 00:59:29,770
There's, uh, ducks in there,
there's plants,

1222
00:59:29,904 --> 00:59:33,307
there's everything
you could want from a lake.

1223
00:59:33,441 --> 00:59:35,676
So, there's that.

1224
00:59:35,810 --> 00:59:37,711
Very cool. Hype.

1225
00:59:37,845 --> 00:59:39,580
Whatever, lit.

1226
00:59:39,713 --> 00:59:41,182
Not sure how much longer
I'm gonna stay here.

1227
00:59:41,315 --> 00:59:42,950
Almost back to LA,
just gonna sell this house,

1228
00:59:43,084 --> 00:59:45,019
and I'm on my way back,
so see you then, cool.

1229
00:59:45,152 --> 00:59:46,654
-Jonas out.
-Yo, yo, yo, hey, hey, hey.

1230
00:59:46,787 --> 00:59:48,189
- What are you doing?
- What?

1231
00:59:48,322 --> 00:59:49,924
Just let's--
let's just take a second, man.

1232
00:59:50,057 --> 00:59:51,859
Take a se-- no, no, no,
get out of my way, okay?

1233
00:59:51,992 --> 00:59:53,360
No, no,
what are you talking about?

1234
00:59:53,761 --> 00:59:55,496
What is this?
What do you mean?

1235
00:59:55,863 --> 00:59:57,264
You're talking
about selling the house

1236
00:59:57,398 --> 00:59:58,866
for the whole world to hear,
don't do that.

1237
00:59:58,999 --> 01:00:00,601
No, that's money
that's going to waste.

1238
01:00:00,734 --> 01:00:02,136
Yuppies are going to buy it up,
and I could use

1239
01:00:02,269 --> 01:00:03,737
-that money right now, okay?
-No, no, hey.

1240
01:00:03,871 --> 01:00:05,973
That's-- that's not
gonna happen.

1241
01:00:06,107 --> 01:00:07,975
Mom gave me the house,
Jonas.

1242
01:00:08,109 --> 01:00:10,077
-Oh, she gave you the house?
-I have-- I haven't told you--

1243
01:00:10,678 --> 01:00:12,279
Oh, she gave you the house?

1244
01:00:13,047 --> 01:00:14,782
Ellie,
that's not how it works.

1245
01:00:14,915 --> 01:00:17,051
I'm the older brother.
I get the house, all right?

1246
01:00:17,184 --> 01:00:19,820
-Conversation over.
-No, no, no. Hey. Sorry, Fredo.

1247
01:00:20,522 --> 01:00:22,256
That's not the way
Mom wanted it, all right?

1248
01:00:22,389 --> 01:00:24,559
I was there to the end.
I was there at the funeral.

1249
01:00:24,725 --> 01:00:27,294
I was also there with the--
with the lawyer and the will.

1250
01:00:27,428 --> 01:00:29,163
And don't forget,
I was here for that,

1251
01:00:29,630 --> 01:00:30,931
All right? That.

1252
01:00:31,065 --> 01:00:32,133
-I'm pretty sure--
-Mom's dying-- No.

1253
01:00:32,266 --> 01:00:33,667
Mom's dying wish.

1254
01:00:33,801 --> 01:00:35,002
That's the only reason
why you're here, right?

1255
01:00:35,136 --> 01:00:36,605
If I wouldn't have
called you,

1256
01:00:36,737 --> 01:00:37,938
you wouldn't have been
here, right?

1257
01:00:38,072 --> 01:00:39,173
It's law of nature,
baby bro.

1258
01:00:39,640 --> 01:00:41,976
I'm the oldest one.
I get the house.

1259
01:00:42,109 --> 01:00:44,879
Now, can we be done
here now?

1260
01:00:45,012 --> 01:00:46,881
Oh, yeah, where'd you get
your law degree?

1261
01:00:47,014 --> 01:00:48,315
-Where'd you get it?
-Stop pushing.

1262
01:00:48,449 --> 01:00:49,717
Instagram?

1263
01:00:49,850 --> 01:00:51,285
Is that where
you learned everything?

1264
01:00:51,418 --> 01:00:54,255
Is this really you, Jonas,
with this jacket?

1265
01:00:54,655 --> 01:00:56,558
Or is this just
some arrogant dream

1266
01:00:56,690 --> 01:00:58,159
that you made up
in your mind, man?

1267
01:00:58,292 --> 01:01:01,028
Like, "Like and subscribe
and abandon Mom."

1268
01:01:03,397 --> 01:01:05,799
-I said it, you abandoned her.
-I didn't.

1269
01:01:08,035 --> 01:01:09,370
I didn't abandon Mom.

1270
01:01:09,770 --> 01:01:11,405
Well, she talked
about you every day.

1271
01:01:11,906 --> 01:01:13,174
Every day.

1272
01:01:14,609 --> 01:01:15,910
You have no idea
what it was like

1273
01:01:16,043 --> 01:01:17,244
with the Alzheimer's, man,
you have--

1274
01:01:19,113 --> 01:01:20,582
She was so far gone, man.

1275
01:01:20,714 --> 01:01:22,116
She started
mistaking me for you.

1276
01:01:22,883 --> 01:01:24,084
You know what that's like?

1277
01:01:24,218 --> 01:01:26,220
She'd look at me
and call me Jonas.

1278
01:01:31,091 --> 01:01:33,060
You talk about getting off
this island of grapes, man,

1279
01:01:33,194 --> 01:01:34,529
and you act like
it's so easy.

1280
01:01:34,663 --> 01:01:36,330
And you act like
I never tried.

1281
01:01:37,031 --> 01:01:38,365
I tried, man.

1282
01:01:39,466 --> 01:01:42,537
I put down a deposit,
I quit the Pizza Shack,

1283
01:01:42,903 --> 01:01:44,471
and I was ready
to move to Oakland.

1284
01:01:44,606 --> 01:01:47,741
I had a nice spot lined up
right by Lake Merit, man.

1285
01:01:47,875 --> 01:01:49,210
You would have loved it.

1286
01:01:50,344 --> 01:01:52,479
You know,
Mom wasn't doing great, but...

1287
01:01:53,847 --> 01:01:55,684
she was--
she was hanging in there.

1288
01:01:55,816 --> 01:01:57,552
So I got
a stay-at-home nurse,

1289
01:01:57,686 --> 01:01:59,453
this nice lady named Irene.

1290
01:02:02,756 --> 01:02:04,124
But then COVID hit.

1291
01:02:05,059 --> 01:02:06,760
So Irene was out,

1292
01:02:06,894 --> 01:02:08,429
and the Pizza Shack
asked me back,

1293
01:02:08,563 --> 01:02:11,098
and they offered me the GM job,
and then Mom got worse.

1294
01:02:11,232 --> 01:02:12,933
And you know
how the story goes.

1295
01:02:17,639 --> 01:02:18,872
But where were you?

1296
01:02:19,974 --> 01:02:21,676
Where-- where were you?
You're my brother.

1297
01:02:21,809 --> 01:02:23,244
You were nowhere
to be found.

1298
01:02:23,377 --> 01:02:26,814
You were just
on some D-level reality show,

1299
01:02:26,947 --> 01:02:28,182
talking to 20-year-old girls,

1300
01:02:28,315 --> 01:02:29,917
trying to ask
which sorry soul

1301
01:02:30,050 --> 01:02:31,285
-will date you next.
-I wasn't--

1302
01:02:31,418 --> 01:02:33,487
I wasn't doing
the dating thing.

1303
01:02:33,622 --> 01:02:34,955
A dating show.

1304
01:02:36,457 --> 01:02:39,793
I wasn't--
I wasn't even on camera.

1305
01:02:40,528 --> 01:02:41,795
What?

1306
01:02:44,599 --> 01:02:45,833
Then what--

1307
01:02:45,966 --> 01:02:47,167
then what's all this talk,
Jonas?

1308
01:02:47,301 --> 01:02:49,403
What-- then what-- what is this?

1309
01:02:49,537 --> 01:02:50,804
I, um...

1310
01:02:53,608 --> 01:02:56,477
I was on this, like,
little web series thing.

1311
01:02:57,311 --> 01:03:01,115
This little show that I did,
so, yes, I did do something.

1312
01:03:01,949 --> 01:03:03,851
I got followers from it

1313
01:03:03,984 --> 01:03:05,386
and-- and a free lunch,

1314
01:03:05,520 --> 01:03:06,854
and I-- I-- I guess,
that was pretty cool.

1315
01:03:06,987 --> 01:03:08,422
It was Chipotle,
but, you know.

1316
01:03:11,258 --> 01:03:13,662
And then, that guy Duncan,

1317
01:03:13,794 --> 01:03:16,698
you know, hits me up,
and he's talking about, like,

1318
01:03:17,164 --> 01:03:18,499
how I could have
my own show,

1319
01:03:18,633 --> 01:03:20,234
and this time,
I would be <i>The Bachelor.</i>

1320
01:03:20,367 --> 01:03:22,036
You know, this time,
I was gonna be the star,

1321
01:03:22,169 --> 01:03:23,571
and, like, the girls
were gonna want to, like,

1322
01:03:23,705 --> 01:03:25,540
you know, have a date
with me or whatever.

1323
01:03:25,906 --> 01:03:27,274
And I was so excited.

1324
01:03:27,408 --> 01:03:28,876
And I was going around
telling everybody,

1325
01:03:29,009 --> 01:03:31,478
uh, you know,
posting about it online.

1326
01:03:31,613 --> 01:03:33,280
I was hitting up,
like, producers and stuff

1327
01:03:33,414 --> 01:03:35,482
to try and get clout
and everything, but...

1328
01:03:38,185 --> 01:03:40,187
I don't know, apparently,
you're not supposed to do that.

1329
01:03:42,823 --> 01:03:44,124
I got in trouble,

1330
01:03:44,258 --> 01:03:45,760
I had to take
the post down, and...

1331
01:03:46,695 --> 01:03:50,632
Uh, eventually, they went
with a different influencer, uh,

1332
01:03:50,765 --> 01:03:54,401
a real influencer, whatever--
whatever that means.

1333
01:03:58,773 --> 01:04:00,107
And...

1334
01:04:01,141 --> 01:04:02,644
I needed money.

1335
01:04:03,243 --> 01:04:06,514
So I-- I asked and asked
and I begged

1336
01:04:06,648 --> 01:04:08,849
until they finally gave me
a position on set.

1337
01:04:09,517 --> 01:04:13,153
And I-- I ended up being a PA,
which is, like,

1338
01:04:13,287 --> 01:04:14,823
I don't know if you know,

1339
01:04:14,955 --> 01:04:16,490
it's, like,
bottom of the totem pole.

1340
01:04:16,624 --> 01:04:19,059
You're like the-- the
bitch ass production assistant,

1341
01:04:22,564 --> 01:04:24,098
16-hour days,

1342
01:04:24,231 --> 01:04:26,133
driving these girls
back and forth

1343
01:04:26,266 --> 01:04:27,669
from the airport.

1344
01:04:27,802 --> 01:04:29,637
I was ripping
labels off of water bottles.

1345
01:04:29,771 --> 01:04:33,407
Uh, I had to lock down sets,
which took hours,

1346
01:04:33,541 --> 01:04:35,476
and I never got
even a thank you for it.

1347
01:04:39,446 --> 01:04:42,082
I don't know,
it's just...

1348
01:04:43,117 --> 01:04:44,385
belittling.

1349
01:04:48,656 --> 01:04:50,424
But, you know, I, uh...

1350
01:04:51,992 --> 01:04:53,360
I was on set, right?

1351
01:04:53,494 --> 01:04:55,896
I can tell people back home
I was on set.

1352
01:04:57,064 --> 01:04:59,233
And eventually,
the show shut down,

1353
01:04:59,366 --> 01:05:02,604
unemployment burned out,
so I needed to find a job.

1354
01:05:02,737 --> 01:05:05,372
And, uh, you know,
like Biggie said,

1355
01:05:05,507 --> 01:05:08,308
"UPS is hiring,"
so-- so I did that.

1356
01:05:09,476 --> 01:05:11,546
I did that.

1357
01:05:12,514 --> 01:05:15,750
Wait, you worked at--
you work at UPS?

1358
01:05:15,884 --> 01:05:17,251
You got the brown shorts
and the--

1359
01:05:17,384 --> 01:05:19,052
and the socks
and everything?

1360
01:05:19,186 --> 01:05:20,421
Why does everybody ask that?

1361
01:05:21,623 --> 01:05:23,023
No, I didn't do that,

1362
01:05:23,157 --> 01:05:25,292
I was-- I was--
I was doing the conveyor belts.

1363
01:05:25,660 --> 01:05:28,696
You know, taking boxes
on and off, and on and off.

1364
01:05:29,898 --> 01:05:31,766
Basically,
what I'm trying to say, Ellie,

1365
01:05:31,900 --> 01:05:33,033
is that I'm broke.

1366
01:05:33,668 --> 01:05:36,036
The only way I pay rent
is by bumming off my girlfriend.

1367
01:05:36,170 --> 01:05:37,672
And I don't know how much longer
that's gonna last.

1368
01:05:37,806 --> 01:05:39,541
I mean, if you want money,
you can just ask me.

1369
01:05:39,674 --> 01:05:40,974
-That's not a problem.
-No, don't, Ellie.

1370
01:05:41,108 --> 01:05:43,343
Don't do that, okay?

1371
01:05:44,077 --> 01:05:45,345
You're my baby brother.

1372
01:05:46,480 --> 01:05:47,882
And I thought--
you know, I thought that

1373
01:05:48,015 --> 01:05:49,283
I was gonna have
this opportunity.

1374
01:05:49,416 --> 01:05:51,084
I thought Duncan
was gonna help me out,

1375
01:05:51,218 --> 01:05:52,953
but that-- but that check
is straight bounced.

1376
01:05:53,521 --> 01:05:55,790
And I'm sitting in LA, broke,

1377
01:05:55,924 --> 01:05:58,258
while these influencers
are, like, shaking their ass

1378
01:05:58,392 --> 01:05:59,627
in front of a ring light,

1379
01:05:59,761 --> 01:06:02,129
and doing the--
the flossing thing

1380
01:06:02,262 --> 01:06:04,031
or whatever's trending
for ten seconds,

1381
01:06:04,164 --> 01:06:05,533
and then boom,
rent is paid

1382
01:06:05,667 --> 01:06:08,135
for their-- their mansion
in Calabasas.

1383
01:06:08,268 --> 01:06:11,739
"Uh, who wants Postmates?
I'm buying."

1384
01:06:13,775 --> 01:06:15,209
So that's what you want?

1385
01:06:15,342 --> 01:06:17,344
You want, like,
that influencer life?

1386
01:06:18,145 --> 01:06:20,981
No, I mean,
not-- not exactly, no.

1387
01:06:21,415 --> 01:06:22,917
Then what
do you want, man?

1388
01:06:23,918 --> 01:06:26,888
'Cause, you know,
everyone's extraordinary,

1389
01:06:27,020 --> 01:06:28,322
you know?

1390
01:06:28,890 --> 01:06:30,224
Not everyone knows it.

1391
01:06:30,357 --> 01:06:31,659
Some more than others,
you know,

1392
01:06:31,793 --> 01:06:34,261
but everyone is.

1393
01:06:34,394 --> 01:06:36,931
I mean, that's all there really
is to it, man, that's life.

1394
01:06:40,200 --> 01:06:42,069
-What?
-That's rich, Ellie.

1395
01:06:42,670 --> 01:06:45,072
This Hallmark card supposed
to make me feel better?

1396
01:06:45,205 --> 01:06:47,374
Well, man, excuse me
for trying to help.

1397
01:06:49,878 --> 01:06:51,111
We spend a lot of time

1398
01:06:51,245 --> 01:06:53,046
doing things
we don't want to do.

1399
01:06:54,081 --> 01:06:55,415
You know?

1400
01:06:56,851 --> 01:06:59,554
And to be honest, man,
no one cares about

1401
01:06:59,687 --> 01:07:01,823
what anybody
is even doing anymore.

1402
01:07:01,956 --> 01:07:03,156
Everyone's too busy.

1403
01:07:03,658 --> 01:07:06,828
I mean, UPS has benefits.
It has a career path.

1404
01:07:06,961 --> 01:07:09,496
And you could act on the side,
so don't give me that.

1405
01:07:09,631 --> 01:07:12,199
You could act on the side,
and work at UPS.

1406
01:07:12,332 --> 01:07:13,835
I-- I know they do that
in Hollywood, man.

1407
01:07:13,968 --> 01:07:15,603
-You've gotta hustle.
-It's not what I want.

1408
01:07:15,737 --> 01:07:17,104
-It's not what I want.
-Then what is it for?

1409
01:07:17,237 --> 01:07:18,540
I want dignity!

1410
01:07:19,473 --> 01:07:21,408
Okay?
I-- I want to feel...

1411
01:07:22,442 --> 01:07:25,580
...pride in what I do.

1412
01:07:27,214 --> 01:07:30,350
Okay, I want--
I want to make Mom proud

1413
01:07:30,752 --> 01:07:33,153
of what I do for once.

1414
01:07:35,623 --> 01:07:36,724
And all this...

1415
01:07:38,225 --> 01:07:39,861
taking boxes off
of conveyor belts,

1416
01:07:39,994 --> 01:07:42,564
and-- and-- and taking
coffee orders from some kid

1417
01:07:42,697 --> 01:07:43,932
who doesn't know
the difference

1418
01:07:44,064 --> 01:07:45,132
between a peach and a plum--

1419
01:07:45,265 --> 01:07:46,500
and that-- that's a true story,

1420
01:07:46,634 --> 01:07:48,736
man-- that's-- that's not it.

1421
01:07:49,871 --> 01:07:51,271
That's not what I want.

1422
01:07:51,405 --> 01:07:52,807
What about the road to riches
that you talk--

1423
01:07:52,941 --> 01:07:54,042
We ain't talking about
the road to riches.

1424
01:07:54,174 --> 01:07:54,609
I'm talking about...

1425
01:07:55,944 --> 01:07:59,013
what you were saying, man,
about that-- that money buys,

1426
01:07:59,146 --> 01:08:01,583
you know, that road, you know,
like the fortune cookie.

1427
01:08:01,716 --> 01:08:03,618
Like-- like
you were saying, man.

1428
01:08:03,751 --> 01:08:06,988
I-- That's not any of this.
I feel like a failure.

1429
01:08:07,822 --> 01:08:10,457
-You're not a failure, Jonas.
-I am.

1430
01:08:11,358 --> 01:08:13,427
No, I am, and I-- I'm--

1431
01:08:15,730 --> 01:08:17,732
I had
these big dreams, man.

1432
01:08:17,865 --> 01:08:20,334
I had these big,
Tinseltown Hollywood dreams.

1433
01:08:20,467 --> 01:08:22,003
I was gonna be in--
I was gonna win an Oscar,

1434
01:08:22,135 --> 01:08:24,137
and I was going to be--
all-- my-- my name in lights,

1435
01:08:24,271 --> 01:08:25,840
and all the cheesy shit.

1436
01:08:27,508 --> 01:08:29,109
And I've been out there
for five years...

1437
01:08:29,877 --> 01:08:33,113
and I don't-- I--
I haven't amounted to jack shit.

1438
01:08:34,381 --> 01:08:36,249
No, for real,
I-- I haven't done any of it.

1439
01:08:36,383 --> 01:08:37,619
I'm just a PA,

1440
01:08:37,752 --> 01:08:39,486
and that's like
a glorified janitor.

1441
01:08:41,656 --> 01:08:42,790
I let Mom down.

1442
01:08:43,925 --> 01:08:45,660
-No, you didn't, man.
-Yes, I did.

1443
01:08:45,793 --> 01:08:47,862
-You didn't let--
-I did. I did.

1444
01:08:48,930 --> 01:08:51,365
I told her I was gonna
buy her a lake house,

1445
01:08:51,498 --> 01:08:53,735
or-- and I was gonna
put her in-- in my movies,

1446
01:08:53,868 --> 01:08:56,604
and then I was gonna
take her to the Oscars with me,

1447
01:08:56,738 --> 01:08:57,905
which is so...

1448
01:08:58,706 --> 01:09:00,541
dumb,
thinking about it now.

1449
01:09:02,644 --> 01:09:04,277
That's why
I didn't go to the funeral.

1450
01:09:04,411 --> 01:09:06,380
I was like, what--
what if little cousin Shay

1451
01:09:07,280 --> 01:09:08,783
were to ask me
a question about it?

1452
01:09:08,916 --> 01:09:10,952
Or, like, you know,
ask me how I'm doing out there,

1453
01:09:11,085 --> 01:09:12,319
what--
what's going on there?

1454
01:09:12,452 --> 01:09:14,221
I don't know
how to bring up answers

1455
01:09:14,354 --> 01:09:15,690
or, like,
bring up excuses quick enough.

1456
01:09:15,823 --> 01:09:17,992
I didn't take
improv or whatever.

1457
01:09:18,526 --> 01:09:20,728
So I blacked out
my screen and--

1458
01:09:25,432 --> 01:09:26,868
I don't want anybody
to see that I had

1459
01:09:27,001 --> 01:09:28,703
this little shithole apartment
in Hollywood.

1460
01:09:28,836 --> 01:09:30,571
Just, like,
this closet size,

1461
01:09:30,705 --> 01:09:32,640
embarrassing piece of shit.

1462
01:09:32,774 --> 01:09:34,474
No one cares
about your apartment.

1463
01:09:34,609 --> 01:09:36,077
-Yes, they do.
-No, you think that.

1464
01:09:36,209 --> 01:09:37,377
You think that,
but we don't, man.

1465
01:09:37,512 --> 01:09:39,080
We just want to see you.

1466
01:09:39,580 --> 01:09:41,015
I want to see you.

1467
01:09:41,549 --> 01:09:43,216
I don't care
if it's over Zoom or anything.

1468
01:09:43,350 --> 01:09:44,919
I just--
we just want to see you.

1469
01:09:45,053 --> 01:09:46,654
I know you want to see me,
and I wanted to be there,

1470
01:09:46,788 --> 01:09:48,255
but there was
a global pandemic.

1471
01:09:48,388 --> 01:09:49,957
So what do you want me
to tell you?

1472
01:09:50,091 --> 01:09:51,258
There were the most deaths
in COVID history that day.

1473
01:09:51,391 --> 01:09:52,794
Just like today, Jonas,

1474
01:09:52,927 --> 01:09:54,595
and just like tomorrow, man,
it's a pandemic.

1475
01:09:54,729 --> 01:09:56,196
You're always shoving shit
in my face, okay, man?

1476
01:09:56,329 --> 01:09:57,965
Just be on my side
for once.

1477
01:09:58,099 --> 01:10:00,601
Oh, how can I be on your side
if you can't be on Mom's?

1478
01:10:01,468 --> 01:10:02,804
What do you call
all of this?

1479
01:10:02,937 --> 01:10:05,606
I call this
"bootleg charity," Jonas.

1480
01:10:07,207 --> 01:10:08,976
It's-- You're pathetic.

1481
01:10:10,545 --> 01:10:11,846
I'm not pathetic.

1482
01:10:14,347 --> 01:10:15,883
I'm not pathetic.

1483
01:10:17,284 --> 01:10:19,386
I was being cautious, okay?

1484
01:10:19,520 --> 01:10:20,888
And I don't expect you
to understand that,

1485
01:10:21,022 --> 01:10:22,456
'cause you're in your safe
little bubble

1486
01:10:22,590 --> 01:10:23,791
where there's,
like, ten people.

1487
01:10:23,925 --> 01:10:25,026
So nobody's going to
get COVID.

1488
01:10:25,159 --> 01:10:26,359
But I was in a hot zone

1489
01:10:26,493 --> 01:10:28,029
where they're telling us
every day

1490
01:10:28,162 --> 01:10:29,897
that if you're around elders,
they could get sick.

1491
01:10:30,031 --> 01:10:31,364
- Didn't wanna do that to Mom...
- Oh, come on.

1492
01:10:31,498 --> 01:10:32,934
Don't even try
to blame COVID.

1493
01:10:33,067 --> 01:10:34,669
...or do that to anybody else
in the family.

1494
01:10:34,802 --> 01:10:36,436
You haven't been home
since Dad died.

1495
01:10:36,637 --> 01:10:38,271
I guess you did mean every word
you said out there, huh?

1496
01:10:38,573 --> 01:10:39,974
You don't deserve Mom.

1497
01:10:40,474 --> 01:10:42,577
You don't deserve
to show your face.

1498
01:10:43,878 --> 01:10:47,048
And I guess now,
you don't deserve the house.

1499
01:10:50,852 --> 01:10:54,321
Wow.
I don't deserve the house.

1500
01:10:55,288 --> 01:10:57,257
How humbling.

1501
01:11:03,363 --> 01:11:04,932
I'm gonna
get that house, Ellie.

1502
01:11:05,833 --> 01:11:07,835
Whether you like it or not,
the house is gonna be mine.

1503
01:11:07,969 --> 01:11:10,171
Yeah,
over my dead body, Jonas.

1504
01:11:10,605 --> 01:11:12,405
I have a realtor,
and I'm fixing the place up,

1505
01:11:12,540 --> 01:11:14,242
and we're gonna get
someone in there,

1506
01:11:14,374 --> 01:11:15,943
and I'm gonna make some money,
and I'm gonna get out of here,

1507
01:11:16,077 --> 01:11:17,410
and I'm gonna
go to Oakland, all right?

1508
01:11:17,545 --> 01:11:18,579
Wow, you have a realtor.

1509
01:11:18,713 --> 01:11:19,814
Yeah, I bet you don't even know

1510
01:11:19,947 --> 01:11:21,182
what a realtor does.

1511
01:11:21,314 --> 01:11:22,349
You better start
telling that realtor

1512
01:11:22,482 --> 01:11:23,551
that we're going to sell it,

1513
01:11:23,684 --> 01:11:25,086
'cause I need that that money

1514
01:11:25,219 --> 01:11:26,954
so I can make a movie,
and get-- get out--

1515
01:11:27,088 --> 01:11:29,056
I won't have to answer to Duncan
or anybody else, okay?

1516
01:11:29,190 --> 01:11:30,658
- "Jonas."
- What?

1517
01:11:30,792 --> 01:11:32,827
"Jonas," that's all I hear,
it's just "Jonas."

1518
01:11:33,393 --> 01:11:34,629
Is that
all you ever think about?

1519
01:11:34,762 --> 01:11:35,897
It's just you
and your LA life?

1520
01:11:36,030 --> 01:11:37,231
Is that all

1521
01:11:37,364 --> 01:11:38,666
-that ever goes around?
-Oh, God.

1522
01:11:38,800 --> 01:11:40,902
You just love
shoving LA in my face.

1523
01:11:41,035 --> 01:11:42,270
Remember, I-- I--

1524
01:11:43,171 --> 01:11:45,673
I asked you to come out
and crash with me.

1525
01:11:47,208 --> 01:11:50,711
And you were too scared,
too shook to-- to--

1526
01:11:50,845 --> 01:11:53,181
to come out to see me,
to see your brother.

1527
01:11:53,815 --> 01:11:56,083
But you made up
all these little excuses.

1528
01:11:59,220 --> 01:12:00,521
That's pathetic.

1529
01:12:01,354 --> 01:12:02,857
I don't have to
put up with this.

1530
01:12:02,990 --> 01:12:04,592
-All right?
-I don't care.

1531
01:12:04,725 --> 01:12:06,060
I don't, man.
You know what? Here.

1532
01:12:06,994 --> 01:12:10,298
It's a lawyer. Call her.
Ask her any question you want.

1533
01:12:10,430 --> 01:12:11,699
It's not my problem.

1534
01:12:11,833 --> 01:12:13,167
She can answer
all your questions.

1535
01:12:13,301 --> 01:12:14,635
I'm done with you.

1536
01:12:31,986 --> 01:12:34,522
You're not going to believe
this, but I do love you.

1537
01:12:39,327 --> 01:12:40,595
When we were kids, man,

1538
01:12:40,728 --> 01:12:42,296
I-- I remember
seeing you in that show,

1539
01:12:42,429 --> 01:12:44,866
<i>The Taming of the Shrew,</i>
and I remember thinking, "Yeah.

1540
01:12:47,134 --> 01:12:49,570
He'll go far,
you know, you got talent."

1541
01:12:51,606 --> 01:12:54,108
If you just tried
to be real for once,

1542
01:12:54,242 --> 01:12:55,676
organic,

1543
01:12:56,677 --> 01:12:59,180
maybe you wouldn't look
for admiration in everything.

1544
01:12:59,313 --> 01:13:00,380
Yeah.

1545
01:13:01,015 --> 01:13:03,718
Says the guy who does nothing
but watch old movies

1546
01:13:03,851 --> 01:13:05,418
every damn day, right?

1547
01:13:05,553 --> 01:13:07,387
Says
"Jonas with the Mostest."

1548
01:13:08,556 --> 01:13:10,524
Not referring
to brain cells there, right?

1549
01:13:10,892 --> 01:13:13,661
You didn't get out of Sonoma,
you ran away.

1550
01:13:14,394 --> 01:13:16,163
You're a walking contradiction.

1551
01:13:17,464 --> 01:13:20,635
Every time you visited,
I saw you slowly dwindle away.

1552
01:13:20,768 --> 01:13:23,137
The outfits,
they got more extravagant.

1553
01:13:23,271 --> 01:13:25,072
The excuses, second nature.

1554
01:13:25,206 --> 01:13:28,109
Only showing your face
when you get paid, right?

1555
01:13:29,644 --> 01:13:31,612
You're nothing
but a hack, Jonas.

1556
01:13:32,313 --> 01:13:33,748
A worthless hack.

1557
01:13:35,883 --> 01:13:37,718
Mom used to
always say to me,

1558
01:13:37,852 --> 01:13:39,287
"The hardest thing in life

1559
01:13:39,419 --> 01:13:40,855
is accepting
the choices of others."

1560
01:13:43,724 --> 01:13:45,159
And I guess-- I guess...

1561
01:13:46,127 --> 01:13:48,428
I just got to listen to Mom,
and I got to let go.

1562
01:13:48,796 --> 01:13:51,332
Wow.
High and mighty are we?

1563
01:13:51,866 --> 01:13:53,968
Elliot, the prodigal son.

1564
01:13:54,335 --> 01:13:56,170
Do you even know
what you're saying?

1565
01:13:57,138 --> 01:13:58,471
Do you?

1566
01:13:58,606 --> 01:14:01,142
You just--
I'm done here. I'm done.

1567
01:14:01,275 --> 01:14:02,643
Hey, uh, before you go,

1568
01:14:02,777 --> 01:14:04,211
why don't you check
in that urn real quick?

1569
01:14:05,579 --> 01:14:06,981
See if there's any
of Mom's ashes left,

1570
01:14:07,114 --> 01:14:08,616
so maybe
you can curl up next to her

1571
01:14:08,749 --> 01:14:10,017
and cry
like the good old days.

1572
01:14:10,151 --> 01:14:11,819
Yeah, why do you think
that is, Jonas?

1573
01:14:11,953 --> 01:14:14,055
You ever wonder why I fell
into that role, huh?

1574
01:14:14,454 --> 01:14:16,090
Why?

1575
01:14:17,425 --> 01:14:18,793
I was up with her
all night

1576
01:14:18,926 --> 01:14:20,361
the night you got
your stomach pumped

1577
01:14:20,493 --> 01:14:22,063
after homecoming,
you remember?

1578
01:14:22,196 --> 01:14:23,731
And then the following weekend
you didn't come home.

1579
01:14:23,864 --> 01:14:25,066
And so, Mom, you know,

1580
01:14:25,199 --> 01:14:26,934
she just loved you
unconditionally,

1581
01:14:27,068 --> 01:14:28,102
no matter what.

1582
01:14:29,036 --> 01:14:31,038
So, yeah,
I fell into that role.

1583
01:14:31,172 --> 01:14:33,874
Or I cuddle up with her,
watch <i>West Wing, Gilmore Girls,</i>

1584
01:14:34,008 --> 01:14:36,110
and I kayaked with her
on this lake.

1585
01:14:38,212 --> 01:14:39,747
'Cause I was a good son.

1586
01:14:40,748 --> 01:14:42,482
I was a good son.

1587
01:14:45,653 --> 01:14:46,988
And you can't take pride
in yourself,

1588
01:14:47,121 --> 01:14:49,090
if you can't take pride
in your own blood.

1589
01:14:49,223 --> 01:14:50,691
It's that simple.

1590
01:14:52,760 --> 01:14:54,996
There's actually
a funny story about that.

1591
01:14:55,997 --> 01:14:57,631
Let me tell you,
baby bro.

1592
01:14:59,633 --> 01:15:00,935
It was, uh...

1593
01:15:01,702 --> 01:15:03,170
a long time ago now.

1594
01:15:03,304 --> 01:15:05,806
I-- I was six, so,
you must have been, like, four.

1595
01:15:06,841 --> 01:15:08,409
I don't know
if you remember this,

1596
01:15:08,542 --> 01:15:12,079
but, uh, Mom had just finished
making this apple pie.

1597
01:15:14,115 --> 01:15:16,517
And it was just sitting there,
getting cold.

1598
01:15:19,053 --> 01:15:20,121
And, uh,

1599
01:15:20,521 --> 01:15:22,957
Mom and Dad got into
one of their shouting matches,

1600
01:15:23,090 --> 01:15:24,959
which they always did and...

1601
01:15:26,293 --> 01:15:28,129
you and I were sitting
on those two stools.

1602
01:15:28,262 --> 01:15:30,064
Remember the ones
on the counter?

1603
01:15:31,532 --> 01:15:34,668
And, uh,
Mom was crying...

1604
01:15:35,970 --> 01:15:37,605
and you were crying.

1605
01:15:41,008 --> 01:15:42,743
And I was thinking that...

1606
01:15:45,446 --> 01:15:47,148
Dad was mean.

1607
01:15:49,650 --> 01:15:51,285
And Mom was weak.

1608
01:15:54,121 --> 01:15:56,824
And that image
is still stuck in my brain.

1609
01:15:59,026 --> 01:16:01,695
There was that cold apple pie
just sitting there.

1610
01:16:05,099 --> 01:16:07,968
That's when I knew
I wanted to do something.

1611
01:16:09,270 --> 01:16:10,604
Do something else.

1612
01:16:12,006 --> 01:16:13,808
Make something in my life.

1613
01:16:15,609 --> 01:16:17,244
So, what,
you decided at age six

1614
01:16:17,378 --> 01:16:20,147
that you weren't gonna be
a part of our family anymore?

1615
01:16:25,453 --> 01:16:27,154
You said it, man,
not me.

1616
01:16:30,891 --> 01:16:33,360
It's kind of funny
that you keep bringing up pride

1617
01:16:33,494 --> 01:16:34,795
and stuff like that.

1618
01:16:35,229 --> 01:16:37,965
You have that compass around
your-- around your waist.

1619
01:16:38,399 --> 01:16:40,935
Attached to the hip
with another man's trash.

1620
01:16:42,703 --> 01:16:43,838
Oh, you didn't know?

1621
01:16:43,971 --> 01:16:45,706
I didn't want to
say anything,

1622
01:16:45,840 --> 01:16:47,074
but I guess...

1623
01:16:48,042 --> 01:16:49,810
I guess
now is the right time.

1624
01:16:50,177 --> 01:16:53,314
That compass
that you hold so dearly...

1625
01:16:55,449 --> 01:16:56,851
it's nothing but a scam.

1626
01:16:58,553 --> 01:16:59,987
I was with Mom
when she, uh,

1627
01:17:00,121 --> 01:17:01,989
when she found
that piece of shit.

1628
01:17:04,091 --> 01:17:06,293
Yeah, yeah. Right, uh...

1629
01:17:06,894 --> 01:17:08,829
Oh, you probably thought
that was, like...

1630
01:17:09,797 --> 01:17:11,098
something important,
I don't know,

1631
01:17:11,232 --> 01:17:14,034
some sentimental gift
to our family.

1632
01:17:15,736 --> 01:17:17,271
No, it's not.

1633
01:17:17,404 --> 01:17:19,707
It's just something Mom found
on the side of the road.

1634
01:17:19,840 --> 01:17:21,775
I was with her when--
we were on a walk,

1635
01:17:21,909 --> 01:17:23,644
and it was just sitting
on the side of the road,

1636
01:17:23,777 --> 01:17:25,212
like roadkill.

1637
01:17:26,347 --> 01:17:27,748
She cleaned it up,

1638
01:17:27,882 --> 01:17:30,117
and she put it in a stocking
for Christmas.

1639
01:17:30,251 --> 01:17:31,886
It was just supposed to be
like a little, like,

1640
01:17:32,019 --> 01:17:33,588
"Ha, ha, ha, ha,"
you know.

1641
01:17:33,721 --> 01:17:35,055
Don't get stuck
on Half Dome again.

1642
01:17:35,189 --> 01:17:36,957
You remember what happened
last time.

1643
01:17:37,324 --> 01:17:38,560
And that was it.

1644
01:17:38,692 --> 01:17:40,060
That's all
it was supposed to be.

1645
01:17:40,961 --> 01:17:42,696
And I remember Dad...

1646
01:17:43,464 --> 01:17:44,965
was in the kitchen,

1647
01:17:45,099 --> 01:17:46,601
after we were done
unwrapping presents and stuff,

1648
01:17:46,734 --> 01:17:48,802
and he-- he was making
Bloody Marys.

1649
01:17:49,703 --> 01:17:51,038
And e handed it to me

1650
01:17:51,805 --> 01:17:53,107
and he said...

1651
01:17:54,141 --> 01:17:56,877
"Real men know
where they're going.

1652
01:17:58,012 --> 01:18:00,281
So pawn this off
for some gas money."

1653
01:18:04,151 --> 01:18:06,487
And I just threw it
in the closet,

1654
01:18:06,621 --> 01:18:07,688
like a piece of junk.

1655
01:18:08,322 --> 01:18:11,058
And I-- I'd forgotten about it
until I saw it today.

1656
01:18:11,192 --> 01:18:13,662
I-- I was trying
not to laugh.

1657
01:18:14,328 --> 01:18:15,863
'Cause, like,
you were walking around,

1658
01:18:15,996 --> 01:18:17,998
wearing it all proud
and stuff.

1659
01:18:19,400 --> 01:18:20,801
So cringy.

1660
01:18:21,603 --> 01:18:23,804
Wearing it like
some dipshit badge of honor,

1661
01:18:23,938 --> 01:18:26,240
like you're in Cub Scouts
or something.

1662
01:18:27,208 --> 01:18:29,310
You're going on
about your little fairy tale,

1663
01:18:29,443 --> 01:18:32,112
about how you're gonna
go to Oakland,

1664
01:18:32,246 --> 01:18:34,248
and have
this hipster cool life,

1665
01:18:34,381 --> 01:18:35,416
watch old movies,

1666
01:18:35,550 --> 01:18:38,553
and do all this Ellie stuff,

1667
01:18:38,687 --> 01:18:40,254
art stuff,

1668
01:18:40,387 --> 01:18:41,822
when you have--

1669
01:18:41,956 --> 01:18:44,058
when you've barely
been outside the 707, man.

1670
01:18:44,758 --> 01:18:46,093
I mean, do you know
how hard it is

1671
01:18:46,227 --> 01:18:47,562
not to laugh in your face?

1672
01:18:48,329 --> 01:18:50,431
All day, you just keep
saying these things,

1673
01:18:50,565 --> 01:18:52,032
and I-- I-- I just--

1674
01:18:52,534 --> 01:18:53,901
It's embarrassing.

1675
01:18:55,135 --> 01:18:56,605
You should be embarrassed.

1676
01:18:57,271 --> 01:19:00,074
And I just know
that this is--

1677
01:19:00,975 --> 01:19:02,544
this is what it is for you.

1678
01:19:03,177 --> 01:19:04,945
COVID was a blessing.

1679
01:19:05,779 --> 01:19:08,849
I mean, COVID must have been
actually a blessing for you.

1680
01:19:08,983 --> 01:19:10,484
You-- you can sit here,

1681
01:19:10,619 --> 01:19:12,486
and-- and do the same thing
day in and day out,

1682
01:19:12,621 --> 01:19:14,388
and when anybody asks,
you could just say, like,

1683
01:19:14,522 --> 01:19:16,757
"Oh, you know,
trying to stay safe."

1684
01:19:17,191 --> 01:19:19,159
When really,
this is all you have.

1685
01:19:20,394 --> 01:19:22,530
That's your sad little life.

1686
01:19:25,899 --> 01:19:27,434
I-- I'll tell you what, okay.

1687
01:19:28,603 --> 01:19:31,805
Because I'm being nice,
and I feel, you know,

1688
01:19:31,939 --> 01:19:33,340
sympathetic, empathetic,

1689
01:19:33,474 --> 01:19:34,908
you probably know
the difference.

1690
01:19:35,644 --> 01:19:37,478
Because I'm feeling nice,

1691
01:19:38,345 --> 01:19:42,149
I'm gonna let you rent
the house for me, okay?

1692
01:19:42,916 --> 01:19:44,451
And so, I make
some money off you,

1693
01:19:44,586 --> 01:19:45,919
and then you just live

1694
01:19:46,053 --> 01:19:48,856
your sad, sad little life
in Slownoma,

1695
01:19:48,989 --> 01:19:52,026
doing the same thing,
day in and day out.

1696
01:19:52,661 --> 01:19:54,828
Sad little Ellie life.

1697
01:19:57,364 --> 01:19:58,432
How's that?

1698
01:19:58,799 --> 01:20:00,167
Is that good for you, bud?

1699
01:20:02,771 --> 01:20:04,038
Ellie.

1700
01:20:04,938 --> 01:20:06,206
Ellie.

1701
01:20:09,943 --> 01:20:11,211
Who's the hack now, huh?

1702
01:20:13,947 --> 01:20:15,949
You little twerp,
think you're so funny.

1703
01:20:16,083 --> 01:20:18,319
What are you doing?

1704
01:20:18,452 --> 01:20:20,020
You think you're so funny.

1705
01:20:20,154 --> 01:20:21,422
- Hey!
- You little twerp.

1706
01:20:21,556 --> 01:20:23,424
Do you know
why I had to get out?

1707
01:20:23,558 --> 01:20:26,093
Because Mom and Dad always said
I needed to be like you, okay?

1708
01:20:26,226 --> 01:20:28,996
"9:00 to 5:00 Ellie.
Be just like Ellie."

1709
01:20:29,129 --> 01:20:30,464
Pretentious little Ellie

1710
01:20:30,598 --> 01:20:31,899
with nothing going on.

1711
01:20:32,032 --> 01:20:33,400
-His little life.
-Hey.

1712
01:20:33,535 --> 01:20:35,402
I wanted to be more, man.
I wanted fans.

1713
01:20:35,537 --> 01:20:36,738
- And I have fans.
- Jonas!

1714
01:20:36,870 --> 01:20:37,838
I'm Jonas with the Mostest

1715
01:20:37,971 --> 01:20:39,273
and I have friends.

1716
01:20:39,406 --> 01:20:41,208
I have followers.
I have influence.

1717
01:20:41,342 --> 01:20:42,811
People like me,
they don't like you.

1718
01:20:42,943 --> 01:20:44,579
You're just a bitch-ass twerp.

1719
01:20:44,713 --> 01:20:46,447
- You little--
- No. No. No. No.

1720
01:20:46,581 --> 01:20:47,948
You have nothing.

1721
01:20:48,082 --> 01:20:49,450
- Except for your little house...
- Jonas!

1722
01:20:49,584 --> 01:20:50,851
...that's gonna be your coffin,
you're nothing.

1723
01:20:50,984 --> 01:20:52,119
You're nothing, Ellie.

1724
01:20:52,252 --> 01:20:53,921
You're nothing.
You're nothing.

1725
01:20:54,054 --> 01:20:55,289
You're nothing.
You're just a hack.

1726
01:20:55,422 --> 01:20:57,858
Just a hack.

1727
01:21:10,538 --> 01:21:11,606
Jonas!

1728
01:21:13,608 --> 01:21:14,875
Jonas!

1729
01:21:15,976 --> 01:21:18,112
No, no, no. Jonas!

1730
01:21:19,079 --> 01:21:20,414
Jonas!

1731
01:21:23,050 --> 01:21:25,018
No, no.

1732
01:21:25,553 --> 01:21:26,821
No, no, no, no, no.

1733
01:21:26,954 --> 01:21:28,188
No, no, no, no.

1734
01:21:28,723 --> 01:21:31,058
Oh.

1735
01:21:31,860 --> 01:21:33,127
Jonas.
