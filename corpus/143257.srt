1
00:01:58,522 --> 00:02:00,990
Kanzaki! Wake up!

2
00:02:02,192 --> 00:02:03,921
You were here all night?

3
00:02:04,528 --> 00:02:05,790
Idiot!

4
00:02:07,330 --> 00:02:09,821
I went over the case again.

5
00:02:10,201 --> 00:02:13,659
Don't you know
what day this is?!

6
00:02:13,871 --> 00:02:15,668
Yeah, I know.

7
00:02:15,806 --> 00:02:17,797
Amazing!

8
00:02:18,309 --> 00:02:21,642
You're looking good.
Like a leading man.

9
00:02:21,779 --> 00:02:24,270
I just sit there.
You're the star today.

10
00:02:24,415 --> 00:02:28,442
I figured you'd be here.
I brought your tux.

11
00:02:28,553 --> 00:02:29,577
Here.

12
00:02:30,154 --> 00:02:36,355
"What a friend we have
in Jesus..."

13
00:02:36,695 --> 00:02:38,925
How does that go again?

14
00:02:39,131 --> 00:02:43,033
The heart had been cut out,
just like in the first two cases.

15
00:02:43,702 --> 00:02:44,634
Mr. Jojima?

16
00:02:44,736 --> 00:02:46,033
I hear you.

17
00:02:46,572 --> 00:02:49,302
Maya Ito, 22,
university student.

18
00:02:49,408 --> 00:02:52,673
No connection
with where she was found.

19
00:02:53,045 --> 00:02:55,309
Went missing
on her way to work.

20
00:02:56,082 --> 00:02:59,108
You're not the only one
on this case.

21
00:02:59,619 --> 00:03:05,421
I've seen a lot of guys who let work
screw up their home life.

22
00:03:06,092 --> 00:03:08,583
It's OK. She understands.

23
00:03:09,062 --> 00:03:11,496
I mean you, not Mina.

24
00:03:12,665 --> 00:03:15,759
Being a detective
isn't a job, it's an illness.

25
00:03:16,469 --> 00:03:20,566
Without meaning to,
you can become a burden.

26
00:03:20,708 --> 00:03:21,800
Remember that.

27
00:03:23,844 --> 00:03:24,902
Yes, sir.

28
00:03:26,447 --> 00:03:27,243
Kanzaki...

29
00:03:30,684 --> 00:03:31,651
Buckle up.

30
00:03:36,790 --> 00:03:38,417
That was fast!

31
00:03:38,692 --> 00:03:40,956
I feel sick...

32
00:03:41,263 --> 00:03:42,753
Don't be too long.

33
00:04:01,616 --> 00:04:02,241
Mina...

34
00:04:04,854 --> 00:04:07,288
Sorry I'm late.

35
00:04:07,923 --> 00:04:10,221
You shouldn't be here.

36
00:04:11,661 --> 00:04:12,719
Mina...

37
00:04:13,996 --> 00:04:15,088
Later.

38
00:04:16,932 --> 00:04:18,092
I'll be waiting.

39
00:07:25,128 --> 00:07:28,859
Welcome to the Gate of Rage.

40
00:07:30,635 --> 00:07:34,366
I am Izuko,
Guardian of the Gate.

41
00:07:36,107 --> 00:07:40,510
You have died.
You exist only as a spirit.

42
00:07:41,779 --> 00:07:47,046
To the Gate of Rage come those
dead of misadventure, or murder.

43
00:07:48,453 --> 00:07:52,515
Her e you may choose
one way to proceed...

44
00:07:52,925 --> 00:07:55,052
...out of three.

45
00:07:55,227 --> 00:07:56,888
Three ways?

46
00:07:57,930 --> 00:07:59,124
One:

47
00:07:59,832 --> 00:08:04,531
Accept death, ascend to Paradise,
and prepare for rebirth.

48
00:08:05,804 --> 00:08:06,930
Two:

49
00:08:07,673 --> 00:08:11,006
As a ghost, forever haunt
the realm of the living.

50
00:08:12,344 --> 00:08:15,178
And three:

51
00:08:16,917 --> 00:08:20,944
Curse one living person,
and bring about their death.

52
00:08:23,156 --> 00:08:26,614
One who kills, however,
falls into Hell...

53
00:08:27,661 --> 00:08:31,927
...to suffer eternal torment.

54
00:08:35,168 --> 00:08:39,162
What's all this about?
What are you?

55
00:08:39,540 --> 00:08:42,202
You haven't accepted it.

56
00:08:48,015 --> 00:08:51,178
You were murdered.

57
00:09:01,363 --> 00:09:04,560
You have 12 days
in which to choose.

58
00:09:05,434 --> 00:09:09,131
You may return
to the realm of the living.

59
00:09:10,138 --> 00:09:14,939
They, of course, will not
be able to perceive you.

60
00:09:16,545 --> 00:09:19,673
Go and see
the world you have left.

61
00:09:27,657 --> 00:09:31,457
It's the same M.O.
As the other three.

62
00:09:32,629 --> 00:09:36,156
The heart cut out
and taken away.

63
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:39,762
In just a few minutes?

64
00:09:40,637 --> 00:09:42,298
Unbelievable.

65
00:09:42,839 --> 00:09:47,470
I don't get it.
I just don't get it.

66
00:09:50,347 --> 00:09:55,341
So whoever did this
still has Mina's heart.

67
00:09:58,422 --> 00:10:02,290
Kanzaki, take some time off.

68
00:10:04,294 --> 00:10:06,387
We'll find your perp.

69
00:10:26,151 --> 00:10:27,448
Why?

70
00:10:27,752 --> 00:10:29,947
Someone murdered you.

71
00:10:31,424 --> 00:10:32,584
Who?!

72
00:10:37,263 --> 00:10:40,198
Will you forget and be reborn?

73
00:10:41,801 --> 00:10:43,962
Become a ghost?

74
00:10:45,738 --> 00:10:50,232
Find and cur se your murderer?

75
00:10:53,713 --> 00:10:55,511
Do I choose?

76
00:10:57,517 --> 00:10:58,677
Yes.

77
00:10:59,653 --> 00:11:02,554
It is my task to guide you.

78
00:11:04,291 --> 00:11:08,022
But I haven't the faintest idea
what to do!

79
00:11:09,062 --> 00:11:11,860
There is still time.

80
00:11:13,166 --> 00:11:14,360
Where does this go?

81
00:11:14,801 --> 00:11:17,464
Any where you like.

82
00:11:17,605 --> 00:11:19,072
Here, then.

83
00:11:20,308 --> 00:11:22,970
Should I put this
over there?

84
00:11:23,077 --> 00:11:24,874
Sure. Why not?

85
00:11:25,413 --> 00:11:29,247
Work with me on this!
You're going to be living here.

86
00:11:30,551 --> 00:11:31,984
Don't you mean "we"?

87
00:11:33,554 --> 00:11:36,489
Then it needs both our ideas.

88
00:11:36,958 --> 00:11:41,020
The kind of place you like
is where I want to live.

89
00:11:44,032 --> 00:11:45,329
Well?

90
00:11:45,501 --> 00:11:46,195
It's great.

91
00:11:47,703 --> 00:11:49,170
Come over here.

92
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:18,699
Welcome home.

93
00:13:04,816 --> 00:13:08,411
Kohei is going to kill
whoever murdered me.

94
00:13:10,021 --> 00:13:13,480
Those who kill,
when they die...

95
00:13:14,093 --> 00:13:19,224
...fall forever into Hell,
there to suffer eternal torment.

96
00:13:21,334 --> 00:13:23,495
Suicides, as well.

97
00:13:24,570 --> 00:13:28,472
Then that means that Kohei...

98
00:13:37,050 --> 00:13:39,041
How did this happen?

99
00:13:41,355 --> 00:13:43,380
Why was I killed?

100
00:13:45,759 --> 00:13:47,158
If you wish...

101
00:13:49,429 --> 00:13:55,095
...you can follow the memory
of your resentment and find out.

102
00:13:59,507 --> 00:14:01,907
I want to know.

103
00:14:18,126 --> 00:14:19,424
Later.

104
00:14:20,129 --> 00:14:21,323
I'll be waiting.

105
00:16:51,486 --> 00:16:53,716
Beretta 84, one.

106
00:16:56,024 --> 00:16:59,324
Walther P99, one.

107
00:17:00,629 --> 00:17:01,960
And...

108
00:17:03,165 --> 00:17:05,895
...a Smith & Wesson 658.

109
00:17:11,207 --> 00:17:15,268
These days the criminals
have the best guns.

110
00:17:15,845 --> 00:17:19,440
I don't know how well
they've been kept.

111
00:17:19,949 --> 00:17:22,475
You might want to
test it first.

112
00:17:26,857 --> 00:17:28,051
Maybe...

113
00:17:30,961 --> 00:17:32,223
Sorry.

114
00:17:32,562 --> 00:17:34,393
Just kidding.

115
00:17:57,321 --> 00:17:59,448
I won't arrest him.

116
00:18:01,058 --> 00:18:04,357
I’ll stop his heart,
and get Mina's back.

117
00:18:05,596 --> 00:18:08,566
That won't make her happy.

118
00:18:10,536 --> 00:18:11,901
"Happy"?

119
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:19,236
The dead can't be "happy".
Death is the end of that.

120
00:18:20,412 --> 00:18:22,175
You know...

121
00:18:23,782 --> 00:18:27,946
...dealing with the dead
every day like I do...

122
00:18:28,587 --> 00:18:30,715
...you get to sense things.

123
00:18:31,491 --> 00:18:32,981
You realize...

124
00:18:33,493 --> 00:18:35,188
...you're not alone.

125
00:18:41,234 --> 00:18:46,171
When someone dies, their weight
goes up 35 grams.

126
00:18:46,306 --> 00:18:47,830
Strange, huh?

127
00:18:48,141 --> 00:18:53,478
It’s scientific fact. Some say
it's the weight of the spirit.

128
00:18:54,281 --> 00:18:57,978
The spirit has negative weight.

129
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:03,547
If that's true,
then ghosts really exist.

130
00:19:06,260 --> 00:19:13,189
A photographer friend took a Polaroid
of a plane he was supposed to get on.

131
00:19:14,568 --> 00:19:19,438
There was this great big hand
grabbing the plane.

132
00:19:21,209 --> 00:19:23,541
He decided to stay home.

133
00:19:24,212 --> 00:19:27,409
The plane crashed.

134
00:19:28,650 --> 00:19:30,208
You're a doctor...

135
00:19:30,318 --> 00:19:34,948
That's how I know that no one walks
without a heart in them.

136
00:19:37,859 --> 00:19:39,191
Meaning?

137
00:19:39,895 --> 00:19:44,889
Why take the heart?
There must be a reason.

138
00:19:45,201 --> 00:19:48,762
This isn't your plain everyday
serial killing.

139
00:19:50,740 --> 00:19:51,866
Bullshit!

140
00:19:53,743 --> 00:19:57,338
I'll find him and kill him.

141
00:19:57,813 --> 00:19:59,644
Spare me the crap!

142
00:22:29,105 --> 00:22:30,663
Sayuri!

143
00:22:49,393 --> 00:22:50,985
Good morning, Chief.

144
00:22:51,094 --> 00:22:54,723
I had some problems with
my siderodromophobia...

145
00:22:54,865 --> 00:22:56,765
Then someone jumped
in front of the train I was on...

146
00:22:56,867 --> 00:22:59,335
Save the excuses, OK?

147
00:23:00,237 --> 00:23:02,398
What were you working on?

148
00:23:03,641 --> 00:23:07,873
"How optical fibre and the development
of communications net works..."

149
00:23:07,979 --> 00:23:09,674
"...affect the world economy."

150
00:23:09,914 --> 00:23:12,439
Oh yeah... that.

151
00:23:13,184 --> 00:23:15,516
Did I mess up again?

152
00:23:16,688 --> 00:23:17,950
This is big.

153
00:23:18,056 --> 00:23:18,522
What?!

154
00:23:18,623 --> 00:23:22,753
It's not trouble. Do you know
who Tatsuya Kudo is?

155
00:23:23,561 --> 00:23:27,293
A genetics researcher,
and a likely Nobel candidate.

156
00:23:27,666 --> 00:23:32,103
Owner of Kudo Genetics,
and top-of-the-list billionaire.

157
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:35,571
Interview him.

158
00:23:36,408 --> 00:23:37,500
Me?

159
00:23:37,610 --> 00:23:40,477
It's not my idea.
He asked for you.

160
00:23:41,580 --> 00:23:42,911
He's handsome.

161
00:23:43,015 --> 00:23:47,714
I don't get it. You've never even
handled a story alone.

162
00:23:48,622 --> 00:23:53,389
Tatsuya Kudo will be our
cover story, so don't screw up!

163
00:23:53,493 --> 00:23:54,824
I’ll do my best.

164
00:23:54,961 --> 00:23:57,794
And make sure
you're on time.

165
00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:01,397
Stand up straight.

166
00:24:03,303 --> 00:24:04,736
And don't simper.

167
00:24:34,803 --> 00:24:36,100
The reporter?

168
00:24:36,238 --> 00:24:37,398
She's coming.

169
00:24:47,883 --> 00:24:49,578
Tatsuya Kudo...

170
00:24:50,485 --> 00:24:51,577
Who are you?

171
00:24:53,956 --> 00:24:55,890
Take us to the safe.

172
00:24:57,660 --> 00:24:58,558
You want money?

173
00:24:58,661 --> 00:24:59,719
Yeah!

174
00:25:11,975 --> 00:25:12,771
Move it!

175
00:25:37,568 --> 00:25:39,468
What the fuck?!

176
00:25:51,583 --> 00:25:53,278
Scared to die?

177
00:25:55,820 --> 00:26:00,223
I'd rather die than be
slime like you.

178
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:09,458
Don't kill him.

179
00:27:33,489 --> 00:27:36,253
This is the best I can do.

180
00:27:37,293 --> 00:27:38,988
It’s a likeness.

181
00:27:41,965 --> 00:27:43,626
Who's this?

182
00:27:44,067 --> 00:27:47,332
An unknown woman I saw
by the church.

183
00:27:50,473 --> 00:27:53,067
All right. I’ll check her out.

184
00:27:53,209 --> 00:27:55,177
You be a good boy.

185
00:27:58,381 --> 00:28:00,179
Where are you going?

186
00:28:00,785 --> 00:28:02,252
And three:

187
00:28:03,254 --> 00:28:08,954
Bring death on a living person,
and fall into Hell.

188
00:28:09,226 --> 00:28:10,488
The curse!

189
00:28:11,595 --> 00:28:17,534
I don't understand
what you're talking about!

190
00:28:23,608 --> 00:28:25,303
"Go, then!"

191
00:28:28,013 --> 00:28:30,846
Can't you knock?

192
00:28:45,531 --> 00:28:47,362
You're still dealing?

193
00:28:49,569 --> 00:28:51,764
Don't you know the law?

194
00:28:54,173 --> 00:28:57,040
It’s called "illegal entry".

195
00:28:59,445 --> 00:29:04,212
I’m not here to hurt your business.
I just want information.

196
00:29:06,452 --> 00:29:07,977
She's my girl.

197
00:29:08,622 --> 00:29:09,680
Oh yeah?

198
00:29:12,392 --> 00:29:13,450
Who is she?

199
00:29:14,361 --> 00:29:16,795
She's connected to
a serial killing.

200
00:29:18,899 --> 00:29:20,389
Serial killing?

201
00:29:23,070 --> 00:29:25,129
With the hearts cut out?

202
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:30,602
I don't know people like that.
It's not my style.

203
00:29:32,213 --> 00:29:34,704
Call me if you hear anything.

204
00:29:37,285 --> 00:29:41,722
Why would I help a cop who couldn't
even protect his own girl?

205
00:30:35,946 --> 00:30:39,405
Whoa, Chief! Take it easy!

206
00:30:44,288 --> 00:30:45,312
Shut up.

207
00:30:46,724 --> 00:30:49,158
Mina had it worse than this.

208
00:30:52,029 --> 00:30:55,829
Talk like that again
and I’ll kill you.

209
00:31:15,487 --> 00:31:17,853
With the human genome mapped...

210
00:31:17,956 --> 00:31:22,188
...it's said we might soon find the cause
of diseases held to be incurable.

211
00:31:23,695 --> 00:31:27,962
We do at least understand why
all the human cells exist.

212
00:31:28,501 --> 00:31:31,493
With the mapping of the genome...

213
00:31:31,738 --> 00:31:34,605
...we see the limits
to what people can do.

214
00:31:35,308 --> 00:31:36,969
I see.

215
00:31:40,113 --> 00:31:44,743
To change the subject, does a man
with your recognition and status...

216
00:31:44,851 --> 00:31:47,184
...ever find himself troubled?

217
00:31:47,621 --> 00:31:48,679
Troubled?

218
00:31:49,123 --> 00:31:52,923
For example, I'm always late.

219
00:31:53,861 --> 00:31:57,024
I wasn't late today
because I had a ride.

220
00:31:58,332 --> 00:32:02,462
I mess up at work a lot,
I'm not much use to anyone...

221
00:32:03,437 --> 00:32:06,770
I wonder what the point is
in me being alive.

222
00:32:08,542 --> 00:32:10,511
The point, huh?

223
00:32:10,845 --> 00:32:16,078
It's no big thing, really.
My troubles are small ones.

224
00:32:16,317 --> 00:32:20,310
My life isn't perfect, either.
Some things don't work out.

225
00:32:21,256 --> 00:32:22,382
For example...

226
00:32:24,092 --> 00:32:27,653
...there are things
no amount of money will buy.

227
00:32:32,333 --> 00:32:34,427
You mean, like, love?

228
00:32:36,806 --> 00:32:38,501
That kind of thing.

229
00:32:44,113 --> 00:32:47,640
Anyway, medicine has always been
a territorial dispute with the Gods.

230
00:32:48,617 --> 00:32:50,949
They decide who's born...

231
00:32:52,121 --> 00:32:53,850
...who gets sick...

232
00:32:55,892 --> 00:32:57,587
...and how long we live.

233
00:33:00,130 --> 00:33:04,567
But someone who doesn't want
to lose the sick person defies them...

234
00:33:04,668 --> 00:33:09,071
...tries to cure the disease
and prolong life.

235
00:33:10,373 --> 00:33:11,397
Yes...

236
00:33:12,008 --> 00:33:16,570
Eventually humanity starts
to fiddle with its own schematics.

237
00:33:19,050 --> 00:33:20,142
The genes.

238
00:33:23,287 --> 00:33:28,020
Advances in research might produce
people who don't get sick.

239
00:33:28,493 --> 00:33:32,088
But some say
that profanes the Gods.

240
00:33:32,230 --> 00:33:34,198
But to save those we love...

241
00:33:36,734 --> 00:33:41,138
We try to do that instinctively.

242
00:33:42,574 --> 00:33:45,668
Even if that profanes the Gods...

243
00:33:45,777 --> 00:33:48,177
...they gave us that instinct.

244
00:33:50,082 --> 00:33:51,276
Therefore...

245
00:33:54,086 --> 00:33:59,114
...it's completely natural
for us to defy the Gods.

246
00:34:03,963 --> 00:34:09,799
But I'm rambling. Let's talk
about this in private sometime.

247
00:34:39,767 --> 00:34:40,734
Not again!

248
00:34:48,876 --> 00:34:50,037
Mina...

249
00:34:55,150 --> 00:34:57,209
Will see you if I die?

250
00:35:09,030 --> 00:35:10,520
No, Kohei!

251
00:35:10,899 --> 00:35:15,269
You'll go to Hell
and we’ll never meet!

252
00:35:15,504 --> 00:35:16,994
Don't!

253
00:35:17,139 --> 00:35:19,107
Kohei, no!

254
00:35:54,077 --> 00:35:56,671
This is that picture.

255
00:35:59,851 --> 00:36:02,149
You brought me here
to see this?

256
00:36:04,489 --> 00:36:05,615
Crap!

257
00:36:06,958 --> 00:36:12,692
That's what they said at the airport
when Kishi showed it to them.

258
00:36:14,299 --> 00:36:16,130
But three hours later...

259
00:36:16,434 --> 00:36:19,767
Kolans Air, Flight 632.
Remember?

260
00:36:23,075 --> 00:36:26,238
He's taken another one.

261
00:36:26,979 --> 00:36:30,278
There's a hand reaching for
this woman's heart.

262
00:36:30,416 --> 00:36:32,407
She might be in danger.

263
00:36:33,585 --> 00:36:37,282
This has nothing to do
with our case.

264
00:36:40,192 --> 00:36:40,851
No.

265
00:36:42,928 --> 00:36:44,328
It does.

266
00:36:48,101 --> 00:36:50,626
You're looking for this woman.

267
00:36:52,939 --> 00:36:53,928
You know her?

268
00:36:54,307 --> 00:36:56,104
She's Tatsuya Kudo's secretary.

269
00:36:56,476 --> 00:36:57,943
Tatsuya Kudo?

270
00:36:58,144 --> 00:37:00,738
Of Kudo Genetics.

271
00:38:21,064 --> 00:38:22,395
Can you see me?

272
00:38:25,402 --> 00:38:26,926
Vaguely.

273
00:38:28,806 --> 00:38:31,502
But you’ll get clearer.

274
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:39,773
With ever y sacrifice
I get stronger...

275
00:38:39,984 --> 00:38:41,849
...and more superhuman.

276
00:38:45,023 --> 00:38:49,255
Who are you?
What do you have against me?

277
00:38:50,562 --> 00:38:53,929
Nothing. I needed you.

278
00:38:54,532 --> 00:38:59,492
You "needed" me? I never
caused you any trouble.

279
00:38:59,637 --> 00:39:02,004
Why did you need to kill me?!

280
00:39:04,043 --> 00:39:06,910
You took happiness for granted.

281
00:39:08,781 --> 00:39:11,511
That happiness is fragile.

282
00:39:12,485 --> 00:39:13,417
So you broke it!

283
00:39:13,519 --> 00:39:15,350
"You broke it!"

284
00:39:21,961 --> 00:39:24,760
I wouldn't cry like that.

285
00:39:30,303 --> 00:39:31,895
What was stolen...

286
00:39:36,743 --> 00:39:38,142
...I would take back.

287
00:39:52,293 --> 00:39:54,989
What's this for?

288
00:39:55,997 --> 00:39:57,692
That?

289
00:40:01,302 --> 00:40:03,896
I used to be like you.

290
00:40:05,506 --> 00:40:08,168
I took happiness for granted.

291
00:40:22,958 --> 00:40:26,223
But happiness can shatter
at any time.

292
00:40:28,597 --> 00:40:30,724
It was sudden for me, too.

293
00:40:35,104 --> 00:40:39,097
One day my wife was smiling gently,
the next she couldn’t move.

294
00:40:43,580 --> 00:40:46,947
I was frantic
trying to find out what was wrong.

295
00:40:51,788 --> 00:40:54,622
But it happened.
There's no going back.

296
00:40:58,329 --> 00:41:01,093
The question is
what to do now.

297
00:41:04,001 --> 00:41:05,366
But why me?

298
00:41:05,469 --> 00:41:09,098
I've already said
the question is meaningless.

299
00:41:10,174 --> 00:41:12,734
Only actions have meaning.

300
00:41:50,783 --> 00:41:53,149
I have another meeting.

301
00:41:55,454 --> 00:41:56,921
I hope you won't mind...

302
00:42:08,502 --> 00:42:09,662
Ow!

303
00:42:10,003 --> 00:42:12,631
I broke something!

304
00:42:17,044 --> 00:42:18,602
What are you doing?

305
00:42:20,047 --> 00:42:21,674
It hurts!

306
00:42:22,015 --> 00:42:24,040
You're dead, you know.

307
00:42:25,286 --> 00:42:27,413
Face it.

308
00:42:34,662 --> 00:42:35,959
Over here.

309
00:42:38,232 --> 00:42:39,597
Who are you?

310
00:42:40,501 --> 00:42:44,767
Maya Ito. Those two
took my heart as well.

311
00:43:08,297 --> 00:43:11,290
Sanae and Katsumi.

312
00:43:14,237 --> 00:43:15,727
All of you?

313
00:43:16,139 --> 00:43:20,075
Yes. They killed all of us.

314
00:43:23,847 --> 00:43:26,873
Where have I seen you before?

315
00:43:27,784 --> 00:43:29,809
At the church.

316
00:43:31,154 --> 00:43:36,024
We tried to warn you.

317
00:43:37,361 --> 00:43:39,124
But why us?

318
00:43:39,997 --> 00:43:45,162
All of you once served
as Guardian of the Gate of Rage.

319
00:43:46,771 --> 00:43:47,863
Guardian?

320
00:43:48,973 --> 00:43:50,372
Like you?

321
00:43:54,378 --> 00:43:58,577
In your last existence,
or perhaps before that...

322
00:43:59,618 --> 00:44:02,348
...you stood as Izuko
at this gate...

323
00:44:03,388 --> 00:44:06,050
...and guided the dead.

324
00:44:07,759 --> 00:44:10,250
That is what connects you.

325
00:44:12,063 --> 00:44:13,792
That's incredible!

326
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:17,327
All of us?

327
00:44:17,702 --> 00:44:19,728
Don't be surprised.

328
00:44:20,840 --> 00:44:24,640
Souls here are reborn
again and again.

329
00:44:25,945 --> 00:44:30,814
Many have served
at this gate.

330
00:44:31,551 --> 00:44:33,883
My last existence?!

331
00:44:34,687 --> 00:44:39,420
I've got no memory of that!
Why should that get me killed?

332
00:44:40,226 --> 00:44:43,025
My task is to guide the dead.

333
00:44:44,131 --> 00:44:47,567
It is you who must decide
what to do.

334
00:44:50,270 --> 00:44:51,532
But...

335
00:44:52,439 --> 00:44:54,907
You have yet to decide...

336
00:44:56,276 --> 00:44:58,744
Soon you must...

337
00:44:59,847 --> 00:45:02,042
...make your choice.

338
00:45:04,652 --> 00:45:06,483
She's not answering!

339
00:45:11,125 --> 00:45:14,526
The first victim,
Sanae Takeuchi.

340
00:45:16,898 --> 00:45:18,331
Katsumi Okamoto...

341
00:45:18,933 --> 00:45:20,594
...and Maya Ito.

342
00:45:23,538 --> 00:45:26,166
You'd see it clearer
if I'd taken the pictures.

343
00:45:27,810 --> 00:45:30,802
I've always been able
to photograph it.

344
00:45:30,946 --> 00:45:33,608
It’s like I'm an antenna.

345
00:45:34,216 --> 00:45:37,481
Like that kid with Bruce Willis
in "Sixth Sense".

346
00:45:37,987 --> 00:45:41,718
Or like in "The Omen".
It’s a warning!

347
00:45:41,857 --> 00:45:44,121
That doesn't help much now.

348
00:45:44,593 --> 00:45:45,958
Enough of this talk.

349
00:45:46,061 --> 00:45:48,325
OK, don't believe me.

350
00:45:48,430 --> 00:45:52,128
But this picture means
Sayuri is going to be next!

351
00:45:52,335 --> 00:45:54,895
Please! Save her!

352
00:45:59,743 --> 00:46:00,971
She's back...

353
00:46:03,747 --> 00:46:05,681
I can sort of see you.

354
00:46:07,083 --> 00:46:10,712
I'm Kazuo Kishi.

355
00:46:12,857 --> 00:46:14,324
His girlfriend?

356
00:46:16,260 --> 00:46:17,454
What's your name?

357
00:46:18,963 --> 00:46:19,987
"Mina"...

358
00:46:20,131 --> 00:46:21,689
Give me a break!

359
00:46:22,166 --> 00:46:24,259
Did you tell him that stuff?

360
00:46:24,368 --> 00:46:25,528
No!

361
00:46:25,670 --> 00:46:27,604
She's telling me to stop you.

362
00:46:27,705 --> 00:46:28,797
Cut it out!

363
00:46:29,407 --> 00:46:32,934
Those who kill go to Hell.
She doesn't want that.

364
00:46:34,312 --> 00:46:35,404
Oh...

365
00:46:36,248 --> 00:46:37,442
...I get it.

366
00:46:39,051 --> 00:46:41,679
You cooked this up to stop me...

367
00:46:41,820 --> 00:46:42,980
You don't believe it?

368
00:46:43,088 --> 00:46:44,419
Of course not!

369
00:46:54,933 --> 00:46:58,563
Tell him something
only he and I would know.

370
00:47:00,106 --> 00:47:01,198
OK.

371
00:47:05,044 --> 00:47:06,375
Last month...

372
00:47:07,146 --> 00:47:09,546
...you two moved into
an apartment.

373
00:47:11,084 --> 00:47:12,142
What?

374
00:47:14,153 --> 00:47:18,556
You put the sofa by the wall,
and her picture on the chest...

375
00:47:18,992 --> 00:47:20,425
...beside the bed.

376
00:47:22,763 --> 00:47:24,822
And today you said...

377
00:47:28,135 --> 00:47:30,035
..."Will I see you if I die?"...

378
00:47:31,939 --> 00:47:34,464
...and put a gun to your head.

379
00:47:37,378 --> 00:47:39,846
Trying to stop you, she screamed.

380
00:47:40,814 --> 00:47:45,878
A glass table-top broke, you were
distracted, and didn't kill yourself.

381
00:47:47,055 --> 00:47:48,886
She stopped you.

382
00:47:50,892 --> 00:47:54,055
She's beside you now,
talking to me.

383
00:47:56,197 --> 00:48:00,497
She says she loves you.
She doesn't want you to die.

384
00:48:03,638 --> 00:48:04,764
The other side.

385
00:48:46,049 --> 00:48:48,279
You worked hard on this.

386
00:48:48,618 --> 00:48:52,487
Did you bug the place?
Where's the camera?

387
00:48:52,590 --> 00:48:54,615
You don't believe me?

388
00:48:59,397 --> 00:49:01,524
Sayuri? Where are you?

389
00:49:01,999 --> 00:49:05,093
You don't have to shout.

390
00:49:05,403 --> 00:49:08,270
Why all the messages?
Is it urgent?

391
00:49:08,406 --> 00:49:09,930
Where are you?!

392
00:49:11,476 --> 00:49:14,843
Now? On a date with Mr. Kudo.

393
00:49:14,946 --> 00:49:15,675
Kudo?!

394
00:49:18,784 --> 00:49:20,342
Get out of there!

395
00:49:20,853 --> 00:49:23,219
What are you talking about?

396
00:49:23,322 --> 00:49:25,950
You're in serious danger!

397
00:49:26,058 --> 00:49:30,119
He's not like you.
He's a perfect gentleman.

398
00:49:30,262 --> 00:49:34,028
Though I wouldn't mind
if he wasn't.

399
00:49:34,333 --> 00:49:37,268
I’m telling you.
You're in real danger!

400
00:49:37,369 --> 00:49:39,565
Are you jealous, Mr. Kishi?

401
00:49:39,706 --> 00:49:41,435
No!

402
00:49:42,108 --> 00:49:44,838
I've got to go.
The performance is starting.

403
00:49:44,944 --> 00:49:47,879
I'm on a date,
so don't call me so much.

404
00:49:47,981 --> 00:49:50,848
In fact, don't call me again, OK?

405
00:49:50,950 --> 00:49:52,941
Sayuri! Sayuri!

406
00:50:04,765 --> 00:50:07,859
She's with Kudo. Find her!

407
00:50:09,136 --> 00:50:12,902
You're a detective. Are you
going to let her get killed?!

408
00:50:14,275 --> 00:50:15,936
What if I'm right?

409
00:50:16,477 --> 00:50:20,777
No one believed me
about the plane crash, either.

410
00:50:21,115 --> 00:50:23,208
You’ll regret it!

411
00:50:27,255 --> 00:50:28,222
OK.

412
00:50:29,324 --> 00:50:30,916
What did she say?

413
00:50:31,560 --> 00:50:36,725
Uh... something about
a performance starting...

414
00:50:37,566 --> 00:50:39,329
A concert? A play?

415
00:50:39,668 --> 00:50:42,466
Kyoko, check
the city listings.

416
00:50:43,171 --> 00:50:44,195
What else?

417
00:50:44,339 --> 00:50:46,171
I heard music...

418
00:50:56,252 --> 00:50:59,415
Schubert..."Death and the Maiden".

419
00:51:01,991 --> 00:51:05,620
A Schubert concert
starting now...

420
00:51:06,729 --> 00:51:10,222
Yes! Organon Hall,
the Stanley Quartet.

421
00:51:17,541 --> 00:51:19,099
He's after another heart.

422
00:51:48,373 --> 00:51:49,965
Get out of here!

423
00:51:50,575 --> 00:51:51,564
Please!

424
00:51:54,680 --> 00:51:55,704
Get out!

425
00:52:55,142 --> 00:52:56,370
Mr. Kudo?

426
00:53:00,247 --> 00:53:03,740
You wanted to know the point
of your being alive.

427
00:53:07,356 --> 00:53:08,653
I’ll tell you.

428
00:53:11,827 --> 00:53:14,694
You have lived
in order to die here.

429
00:53:22,204 --> 00:53:24,729
I need your heart.

430
00:54:06,216 --> 00:54:08,241
The first victim was found here.

431
00:54:08,719 --> 00:54:09,777
The second...

432
00:54:10,220 --> 00:54:11,347
...and third.

433
00:54:21,299 --> 00:54:23,290
An equilateral triangle.

434
00:54:24,235 --> 00:54:25,361
And here?

435
00:54:25,470 --> 00:54:28,462
I don't get it.
I just don't get it.

436
00:54:30,074 --> 00:54:36,173
Wait a minute... the concert hall
Kanzaki went to is here.

437
00:54:36,315 --> 00:54:39,751
What does a concert hall
have to do with it?

438
00:54:40,753 --> 00:54:42,277
Look at this.

439
00:54:43,956 --> 00:54:45,184
What is it?

440
00:54:45,458 --> 00:54:50,020
They went there because
they think that girl's next.

441
00:54:59,973 --> 00:55:02,168
A figure of some kind...

442
00:55:05,745 --> 00:55:06,734
Come on.

443
00:55:07,347 --> 00:55:08,371
Right.

444
00:56:44,081 --> 00:56:44,945
Hey!

445
00:56:52,157 --> 00:56:53,181
Halt!

446
00:57:53,220 --> 00:57:55,120
Are you OK?!

447
00:57:55,255 --> 00:57:56,415
Snap out of it!

448
00:58:17,211 --> 00:58:19,111
The Guardian of the Gate...

449
00:58:21,382 --> 00:58:22,509
...Izuko.

450
00:58:26,088 --> 00:58:28,283
Hey!

451
00:58:29,258 --> 00:58:31,249
What happened?!

452
00:58:31,393 --> 00:58:33,361
Kishi! Are you OK?

453
00:58:34,763 --> 00:58:39,666
Another victim. The killers
are Tatsuya Kudo and his secretary.

454
00:58:40,536 --> 00:58:43,835
He was holding her heart.
It was still beating.

455
00:58:47,177 --> 00:58:47,939
What?

456
00:58:48,178 --> 00:58:49,406
I can't...

457
00:58:49,546 --> 00:58:50,604
What's wrong?

458
00:58:51,481 --> 00:58:55,781
As a doctor I’m not ready for this.
This man has no pulse.

459
00:58:56,386 --> 00:58:57,353
But he's alive.

460
00:58:59,589 --> 00:59:01,716
His heart isn't beating.

461
00:59:03,193 --> 00:59:06,321
You can do what you like
in this world.

462
00:59:07,531 --> 00:59:12,468
But I won't let you raise a hand
against the souls at my gate.

463
01:00:13,566 --> 01:00:14,863
There's a spell on this sword.

464
01:00:16,670 --> 01:00:20,299
It even cuts down the dead.

465
01:00:34,221 --> 01:00:38,591
Am I crazy, or are you?

466
01:00:41,529 --> 01:00:43,793
Look inside this...

467
01:00:49,871 --> 01:00:52,169
"Shuho Kamina"...

468
01:00:52,170 --> 01:00:55,070
She's our only hope.

469
01:00:55,371 --> 01:00:56,071
Who is she?

470
01:00:58,969 --> 01:01:04,404
After the plane crash
I was haunted by the ghosts...

471
01:01:04,708 --> 01:01:06,234
...of the 430 people who died.

472
01:01:08,734 --> 01:01:11,589
She exorcised them for me.
