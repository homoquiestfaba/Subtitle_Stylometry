1
00:00:25,809 --> 00:00:29,245
Be very quiet. I'm hunting rabbits.

2
00:00:35,785 --> 00:00:39,277
I am a duck bent on self-preservationum.

3
00:00:41,825 --> 00:00:45,317
Say your prayers, rabbit.
It's rabbit season.

4
00:00:45,628 --> 00:00:48,324
- Duck season.
- Rabbit season!

5
00:00:52,502 --> 00:00:53,867
Duck season! Fire!

6
00:01:06,382 --> 00:01:07,974
Hold everything.

7
00:01:08,151 --> 00:01:11,518
"Daffy gets blasted."
Page 7: "Daffy gets blasted."

8
00:01:12,055 --> 00:01:14,785
Page 8: "Daffy gets blasted again!"

9
00:01:14,858 --> 00:01:19,022
What's the matter with you people?
We can't do this kind of stuff anymore.

10
00:01:19,129 --> 00:01:20,494
Brothers Warner...

11
00:01:20,563 --> 00:01:24,192
show biz legends like me
shouldn't have to play stooge...

12
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:27,167
to that long-eared,
carrot-chomping, overbite-challenged...

13
00:01:27,904 --> 00:01:29,201
What's up, doc?

14
00:01:31,541 --> 00:01:33,202
Bobby, how's the wife?

15
00:01:33,309 --> 00:01:36,073
Great nose job, Chuck. Thanks, girls.

16
00:01:36,179 --> 00:01:38,807
Good rug, Mel. Never would have guessed.

17
00:01:39,415 --> 00:01:41,679
- Pardon me.
- The pleasure is mine.

18
00:01:41,751 --> 00:01:45,346
Fellas, I think Daff's right.
Maybe I'll take a vacation.

19
00:01:45,421 --> 00:01:47,889
Go visit my 542 nieces and nephews.

20
00:01:47,991 --> 00:01:49,891
Mr. Duck, excuse me, I'm sorry.

21
00:01:49,993 --> 00:01:54,020
I don't see how we can have
a Bugs Bunny movie without Bugs Bunny.

22
00:01:54,097 --> 00:01:55,689
Oh, my heavens, no.

23
00:01:55,765 --> 00:01:58,325
You couldn't have a movie
without Bugs Bunny.

24
00:01:58,401 --> 00:02:02,599
If you don't mind me asking, whose
glorified personal assistant are you?

25
00:02:02,705 --> 00:02:05,572
Kate Houghton, Vice President, Comedy.

26
00:02:06,109 --> 00:02:07,269
Right.

27
00:02:07,544 --> 00:02:09,205
Kate did Lethal Weapon Babies.

28
00:02:09,279 --> 00:02:12,942
Finally, a Lethal Weapon
that I can take my grandchildren to.

29
00:02:13,383 --> 00:02:14,941
Gentlemen, check your phones.

30
00:02:15,051 --> 00:02:18,578
Our latest research shows
that Bugs Bunny is a core asset...

31
00:02:18,688 --> 00:02:22,954
that appeals to male and female,
young and old throughout the universe...

32
00:02:23,059 --> 00:02:26,222
while your fan base
is limited to angry fat guys in basements.

33
00:02:26,296 --> 00:02:31,233
Yeah, but... Come on, fellas,
I'm thrice the entertainer the rabbit is!

34
00:02:34,737 --> 00:02:36,261
Fine, it's hilarious...

35
00:02:36,372 --> 00:02:39,569
but moviegoers these days
demand action heroes, like me!

36
00:02:47,083 --> 00:02:48,710
Top that, rabbit.

37
00:02:54,057 --> 00:02:56,218
So, it has come to this, has it?

38
00:02:56,292 --> 00:02:58,726
I'm afraid
the Brothers Warner must choose...

39
00:02:58,795 --> 00:03:00,592
between a handsome matinee idol...

40
00:03:00,663 --> 00:03:04,326
or this miscreant perpetrator
of low burlesque.

41
00:03:06,336 --> 00:03:08,133
Whichever one's not the duck.

42
00:03:09,973 --> 00:03:12,134
That's the stuff from my office.

43
00:03:12,242 --> 00:03:14,642
- You don't have an office.
- Not anymore.

44
00:03:14,744 --> 00:03:16,507
Symbolically, this is bad.

45
00:03:16,779 --> 00:03:19,247
Please, brother. Other brother?

46
00:03:19,782 --> 00:03:22,182
Icy she-wolf? Help me, please.

47
00:03:22,919 --> 00:03:25,149
I'm too moist and tender to retire.

48
00:03:25,455 --> 00:03:27,514
- Let me escort you out.
- Wait!

49
00:03:27,624 --> 00:03:30,320
I haven't tried toadying, kowtowing,
or butt-kissing yet.

50
00:03:30,426 --> 00:03:32,417
I'm still begging here!

51
00:03:35,198 --> 00:03:36,460
Freeze!

52
00:03:51,114 --> 00:03:52,672
Can I try that again?

53
00:03:52,782 --> 00:03:55,512
No, thank you. We'll call you.

54
00:04:01,124 --> 00:04:03,649
Hey, D.J. How did your tryout go?

55
00:04:03,726 --> 00:04:07,560
Well, let's see.
I can say I made an impression.

56
00:04:07,997 --> 00:04:10,864
Your father can get you a job
anytime he wants to.

57
00:04:10,967 --> 00:04:14,198
I know, but I don't want that.
I'd really rather earn it, sir.

58
00:04:14,304 --> 00:04:18,138
- Mr. Warner mentioned you this morning.
- He did? What did he say?

59
00:04:18,207 --> 00:04:20,801
He said don't forget the TurtleWax.

60
00:04:22,545 --> 00:04:24,809
What about animation?
I could do cartoons.

61
00:04:24,881 --> 00:04:26,075
Dead duck walking.

62
00:04:26,182 --> 00:04:27,843
- Morning, Mr. Bunny.
- Very hot now.

63
00:04:27,917 --> 00:04:29,179
And I do voices. Listen.

64
00:04:29,252 --> 00:04:31,686
- Excuse me.
- "Fetch the stick, boy."

65
00:04:31,821 --> 00:04:34,881
"What a maroon."
"You can't handle the truth."

66
00:04:35,358 --> 00:04:36,848
Some grip, lady.

67
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:39,151
I need you to eject this duck.

68
00:04:39,696 --> 00:04:41,891
- Lady, this is Daffy Duck.
- Exactly.

69
00:04:41,998 --> 00:04:43,761
- Not anymore. We own the name.
- Yeah?

70
00:04:43,866 --> 00:04:46,494
You can't stop me from calling myself...

71
00:04:47,170 --> 00:04:49,331
- What do you know?
- You fired Daffy Duck?

72
00:04:49,405 --> 00:04:51,771
No, I didn't. I did. They did.

73
00:04:51,941 --> 00:04:54,341
You just were following orders.

74
00:04:55,445 --> 00:04:57,913
You know what? You don't know me.

75
00:04:58,848 --> 00:05:02,249
You're Kate Houghton,
you're the VP of Comedy. Go figure.

76
00:05:02,352 --> 00:05:06,584
You drive a red 1988 Alfa Romeo.
Good engine. Little under-driven.

77
00:05:06,756 --> 00:05:10,248
I know this
because you nearly ran me over last week.

78
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:14,352
Anyway, about that duck,
you want me to get rid of him still?

79
00:05:16,899 --> 00:05:19,390
- Duck, yes. Eject the duck, please.
- I can't do that.

80
00:05:19,469 --> 00:05:21,232
- Why not?
- He's gone.

81
00:05:26,743 --> 00:05:29,211
What are you waiting for, backup?

82
00:05:36,486 --> 00:05:38,784
Shabby job so far, constable.

83
00:05:39,389 --> 00:05:40,981
Quick! After me!

84
00:05:41,124 --> 00:05:44,389
Now you're gonna pay for that one.
Come here!

85
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:46,587
- Dress Inspector!
- Look out!

86
00:05:46,662 --> 00:05:48,630
One side, Spartacuses.

87
00:05:51,901 --> 00:05:53,926
- Come on.
- Daffy, stop!

88
00:05:54,404 --> 00:05:56,395
Cut him off at the pass, boys.

89
00:05:56,839 --> 00:05:59,740
All units in pursuit of little black duck.

90
00:06:05,248 --> 00:06:07,079
Well, that's just cheating.

91
00:06:21,097 --> 00:06:22,621
Don't follow me.

92
00:06:27,670 --> 00:06:30,298
That's not right. Cut!

93
00:06:34,143 --> 00:06:35,872
That's lunch, everybody!

94
00:06:38,648 --> 00:06:41,674
- That airbag cost a lot of money.
- I'm okay.

95
00:06:43,486 --> 00:06:45,511
Good morning. Batman, you good?

96
00:06:45,621 --> 00:06:46,883
All right.

97
00:06:47,657 --> 00:06:49,386
My chariot awaits.

98
00:06:49,625 --> 00:06:50,887
Yes!

99
00:06:51,661 --> 00:06:54,289
Bat-lights. Bat-conditioning. Bat-stereo.

100
00:06:55,198 --> 00:06:56,563
To the Duck Cave.

101
00:06:57,233 --> 00:06:58,723
Now what are you doing?

102
00:06:58,901 --> 00:07:01,301
Stay away from that Batmobile!

103
00:07:02,405 --> 00:07:06,000
- I'm allowed to steal. I'm a celebrity.
- Tell it to the judge!

104
00:07:06,843 --> 00:07:08,811
- Feeling pretty good about yourself?
- I am.

105
00:07:11,848 --> 00:07:14,316
- You bested that dastardly duck?
- I did.

106
00:07:15,651 --> 00:07:18,245
You're gonna offer your catch
to the pretty executive?

107
00:07:18,354 --> 00:07:19,378
Indeed.

108
00:07:21,657 --> 00:07:23,090
Miss Houghton!

109
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:32,863
Get out of the way!

110
00:07:38,741 --> 00:07:39,833
Look out!

111
00:07:52,355 --> 00:07:54,550
What do you know? I found Nemo.

112
00:07:59,362 --> 00:08:01,227
I think she likes you.

113
00:08:10,406 --> 00:08:13,204
Your father would be so ashamed of you.

114
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:32,785
But I was... It was...

115
00:08:37,466 --> 00:08:41,766
At first, they told me to lose the stutter.
Now they tell me I'm not funny.

116
00:08:41,837 --> 00:08:44,772
It's a pain in the butt
being politically correct.

117
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:46,569
You're telling me.

118
00:08:47,143 --> 00:08:49,168
What kind of performance
do you call that?

119
00:08:49,278 --> 00:08:52,304
You made me sound
like a total space cadet, man.

120
00:08:52,415 --> 00:08:56,442
I'm sorry you feel that way.
I was trying to be real to your character.

121
00:08:56,519 --> 00:09:00,421
If you, like, goof on me in the sequel,
I'm coming after you.

122
00:09:00,489 --> 00:09:02,980
And I'll give you a Scooby Snack!

123
00:09:03,693 --> 00:09:06,662
There are some areas of the script
I think we need to address.

124
00:09:06,762 --> 00:09:09,993
There's no heart, no cooperation,
nobody learns anything.

125
00:09:10,099 --> 00:09:12,693
Daffy learns not to stick his head
in a jet engine.

126
00:09:12,802 --> 00:09:15,600
- He's gone.
- No, Daffy always comes back.

127
00:09:15,671 --> 00:09:17,536
I just tell him how much I need him.

128
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:20,609
We hug, we cry,
I drop something heavy on him, I laugh.

129
00:09:20,676 --> 00:09:23,543
The duck is history, okay?
So the question is...

130
00:09:23,646 --> 00:09:27,707
how can I help you
reposition your brand identity?

131
00:09:28,484 --> 00:09:32,386
Answer: We team you up
with a hot female co-star.

132
00:09:32,555 --> 00:09:33,852
Usually...

133
00:09:34,156 --> 00:09:36,488
I play the female love interest.

134
00:09:39,328 --> 00:09:43,321
About the cross-dressing thing?
In the past, funny. Today, disturbing.

135
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,798
Lady, if you don't find a rabbit
with lipstick amusing...

136
00:09:46,869 --> 00:09:48,894
you and I have
nothing to say to each other.

137
00:09:49,005 --> 00:09:51,633
Look, I'm trying to be nice...

138
00:09:51,741 --> 00:09:54,369
but I was brought in
to leverage your synergy...

139
00:09:54,477 --> 00:09:57,310
and I am not going to let you
or some wacky duck...

140
00:09:57,380 --> 00:09:58,472
Daffy.

141
00:09:58,547 --> 00:10:02,176
Wacky, daffy, nutty, fruitcake,
crispy over rice, it doesn't matter.

142
00:10:02,318 --> 00:10:04,013
Well, these matter.

143
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:05,919
And this.

144
00:10:06,422 --> 00:10:09,983
And they say we get Daffy back.
Right, boys?

145
00:10:10,059 --> 00:10:12,152
- We want Daffy!
- Bring him back!

146
00:10:12,228 --> 00:10:13,525
We love Daffy!

147
00:10:19,502 --> 00:10:20,992
Little Damian.

148
00:10:21,671 --> 00:10:23,104
Hey, Granny.

149
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:24,999
Hi, Tweety.

150
00:10:25,074 --> 00:10:26,564
How was work today?

151
00:10:27,910 --> 00:10:29,207
Eventful.

152
00:10:29,512 --> 00:10:31,571
What a nice young man.

153
00:10:48,931 --> 00:10:51,263
Guess who? So did you miss me?

154
00:10:55,738 --> 00:10:57,296
I'm glad I was fired.

155
00:10:57,406 --> 00:11:00,273
In a few days,
they'll be kissing my befeathered rump...

156
00:11:00,376 --> 00:11:02,241
begging me to come back. But I won't.

157
00:11:02,311 --> 00:11:04,472
Did I miss the part where I invited you in?

158
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:07,378
I'll be too busy accepting numerous,
multiple offers.

159
00:11:07,450 --> 00:11:09,213
Every studio in town...

160
00:11:12,488 --> 00:11:15,321
Who am I kidding? My career is over.

161
00:11:16,125 --> 00:11:18,320
Perhaps I was being too polite. Get out!

162
00:11:18,427 --> 00:11:21,157
I'll starve. I'll have to eat envelope glue.

163
00:11:21,263 --> 00:11:22,662
Wait, a sushi bar.

164
00:11:24,467 --> 00:11:25,764
No!

165
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:32,764
- Daffy.
- Yes.

166
00:11:33,642 --> 00:11:35,906
Leave my father's house. Now.

167
00:11:40,916 --> 00:11:42,816
You live with Daddy?

168
00:11:42,952 --> 00:11:46,513
Yeah, so?
Just, you know, kind of temporarily.

169
00:11:46,622 --> 00:11:48,613
I've hit rock bottom.

170
00:11:48,691 --> 00:11:52,286
I'm hanging out with a security guard
who lives with his father.

171
00:11:54,697 --> 00:11:58,599
My grease and gravy!
Your dad is Damian Drake.

172
00:11:59,535 --> 00:12:03,096
- The super spy.
- He's an actor who plays a spy.

173
00:12:04,106 --> 00:12:07,507
- And that? That was his I Spy Award.
- Ingenious.

174
00:12:07,743 --> 00:12:12,737
An actor playing a super spy as a cover
for being a super spy playing an actor.

175
00:12:12,815 --> 00:12:15,648
In fact, I'll bet this whole dump
is a super spy lair.

176
00:12:15,718 --> 00:12:17,447
Nothing is as it seems.

177
00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:22,281
You're probably protected by
an invisible force field right this minute.

178
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:26,323
The force field-penetrating apple.

179
00:12:26,395 --> 00:12:29,694
Just feel free to continue
your delusional ranting...

180
00:12:30,032 --> 00:12:31,863
while I answer my...

181
00:12:32,902 --> 00:12:34,164
Remote?

182
00:12:37,339 --> 00:12:38,533
Hello?

183
00:12:50,853 --> 00:12:52,252
- Son?
- Dad?

184
00:12:53,322 --> 00:12:55,256
What are you doing in the painting?

185
00:12:55,357 --> 00:12:59,521
I wanted to keep you out of this,
but there's no one else I can trust.

186
00:12:59,829 --> 00:13:01,558
Can you hold on a second?

187
00:13:02,531 --> 00:13:04,226
Are you shooting a movie or something?

188
00:13:04,333 --> 00:13:06,528
A new Damian Drake movie? Cool.

189
00:13:06,735 --> 00:13:08,396
Come to Las Vegas.

190
00:13:11,106 --> 00:13:13,870
Ask Dusty Tails for the Blue Monkey.

191
00:13:14,176 --> 00:13:16,167
The Blue Monkey? What's a Blue Monkey?

192
00:13:16,245 --> 00:13:18,770
A diamond. A very special diamond.

193
00:13:19,348 --> 00:13:20,940
Find Dusty Tails.

194
00:13:23,052 --> 00:13:26,112
Dad, you need me
to call the police or something?

195
00:13:28,858 --> 00:13:30,792
- No police.
- Dad, are you all right?

196
00:13:30,893 --> 00:13:34,124
I'm sorry I never told you this before,
but I...

197
00:13:37,967 --> 00:13:40,697
- Dad?
- Diamond? I'm rich!

198
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:47,403
- I've joined the leisure class.
- I gotta go save my dad.

199
00:13:47,476 --> 00:13:51,435
Your dad, yeah.
So count me in. A spy caper.

200
00:13:51,547 --> 00:13:55,574
Double agents, exploding bikinis,
tigers hanging from helicopters!

201
00:13:55,784 --> 00:13:57,718
I'm through with show biz!

202
00:13:57,786 --> 00:13:59,947
From now on,
I'm gonna live the adventure.

203
00:14:00,055 --> 00:14:03,081
- Next stop, Las Vegas.
- I'll take my dad's old car.

204
00:14:03,492 --> 00:14:06,950
- A super spy car. Let's ride.
- This isn't a spy car.

205
00:14:07,596 --> 00:14:10,895
Your dad is a spy. Ipso ergo, a spy car.

206
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,332
I used to deliver pizzas in this car.

207
00:14:14,670 --> 00:14:16,262
Secret pizzas?

208
00:14:16,505 --> 00:14:18,234
A spy pie, maybe?

209
00:14:19,642 --> 00:14:22,577
Fine, be that way.
But it's definitely a spy car!

210
00:14:22,645 --> 00:14:24,135
A little help here?

211
00:14:25,848 --> 00:14:26,974
Ducks.

212
00:14:35,758 --> 00:14:37,783
You know how I know it's a spy car?

213
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:41,193
Because it looks
absolutely nothing like a spy car.

214
00:14:57,646 --> 00:15:01,514
I don't think this routine
is gonna work without Daffy, but...

215
00:15:01,617 --> 00:15:02,641
Action.

216
00:15:02,718 --> 00:15:05,687
Say your prayers, rabbit.
It's rabbit season.

217
00:15:05,788 --> 00:15:08,018
- Duck season.
- Rabbit season.

218
00:15:10,326 --> 00:15:13,022
- Rabbit season.
- Wait a minute.

219
00:15:13,128 --> 00:15:15,460
See, I told you
this wasn't gonna work without...

220
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:21,064
Pain. Agony!

221
00:15:22,838 --> 00:15:24,169
You're fired.

222
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:26,200
What?

223
00:15:26,742 --> 00:15:29,575
- But you...
- You got rid of our best duck.

224
00:15:32,481 --> 00:15:34,244
You can't fire me.

225
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:37,478
My films have made $950 million!

226
00:15:37,886 --> 00:15:40,582
- That's not a billion.
- Nope. Not a billion.

227
00:15:40,689 --> 00:15:42,213
Okay.

228
00:15:44,493 --> 00:15:45,858
All right.

229
00:15:46,195 --> 00:15:50,063
I think we can all agree that the decision
to get rid of Daffy was a poor one.

230
00:15:50,165 --> 00:15:51,598
But it's time to move on.

231
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:55,568
And by move on, I mean reversing course
and getting Daffy back.

232
00:15:55,938 --> 00:15:57,269
By Monday.

233
00:15:58,774 --> 00:16:01,265
I will have Daffy back on Monday.

234
00:16:03,278 --> 00:16:04,768
That went well.

235
00:16:05,114 --> 00:16:09,448
Listen, doll face, if I know Daffy,
he's already hit the road by now.

236
00:16:16,558 --> 00:16:17,923
It's good to stretch.

237
00:16:17,993 --> 00:16:20,325
I'm getting tired
of throwing you out of the car.

238
00:16:20,429 --> 00:16:22,454
That's my plan in a nutshell.

239
00:16:22,998 --> 00:16:26,490
Now, listen, if we run into anything
that requires super spy skills...

240
00:16:26,602 --> 00:16:30,060
like cracking wise, smooching dames,
you better leave that to me.

241
00:16:30,139 --> 00:16:33,404
However, if we have
any security guarding needs...

242
00:16:33,676 --> 00:16:36,509
Very funny, duck. I'm not a security guard.

243
00:16:36,612 --> 00:16:40,013
For your information, it's just a job.
It's what I do for money.

244
00:16:40,115 --> 00:16:42,106
What I really do is...

245
00:16:43,118 --> 00:16:44,449
I'm a stuntman.

246
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:46,988
- You? A stuntman? Please.
- I am!

247
00:16:47,356 --> 00:16:51,417
Did you see those Mummy movies?
I'm in them more than Brendan Fraser is.

248
00:16:52,428 --> 00:16:54,089
No, he couldn't stand that.

249
00:16:54,163 --> 00:16:58,122
One day he decides that, "No!
The Bren-master does all his own stunts!"

250
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:02,466
Listen, muscles, if this heap ever makes it
to Vegas, I'll do all the stunts.

251
00:17:02,538 --> 00:17:03,664
Duck here.

252
00:17:03,772 --> 00:17:07,264
- Daffy, old chum, how the heck...
- Cram it down your rabbit hole.

253
00:17:07,342 --> 00:17:11,369
I think I can get you your old job back
with less of a pay cut than usual.

254
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:12,970
So not interested.

255
00:17:13,048 --> 00:17:16,176
I'm off to Las Vegas
with my new sidekick D. J...

256
00:17:16,285 --> 00:17:18,685
to match wits with spies and showgirls.

257
00:17:18,787 --> 00:17:20,687
It's a little adventure I call:

258
00:17:20,789 --> 00:17:23,553
"Daffy Duck's Quest for the Blue Monkey."

259
00:17:23,659 --> 00:17:25,627
And you're not in it.

260
00:17:27,629 --> 00:17:29,119
Blue Monkey?

261
00:17:42,311 --> 00:17:43,573
Blue Monkey?

262
00:17:45,914 --> 00:17:47,711
It's a little adventure I call:

263
00:17:47,816 --> 00:17:50,808
"Daffy Duck's Quest for the Blue Monkey."

264
00:18:04,533 --> 00:18:06,228
This is unacceptable!

265
00:18:09,872 --> 00:18:13,865
We cannot have 9-year-olds working
in sweatshops making Acme sneakers...

266
00:18:14,009 --> 00:18:17,035
not when 3-year-olds
work for so much less.

267
00:18:18,614 --> 00:18:21,242
But, sir, they require naps.

268
00:18:22,117 --> 00:18:25,086
Put double espresso in their sippy cups.

269
00:18:28,023 --> 00:18:29,615
What's next on the agenda?

270
00:18:29,725 --> 00:18:33,092
Where's my people? What's coming up?
What's the next thing?

271
00:18:36,799 --> 00:18:38,391
Thank you, Bob.

272
00:18:39,034 --> 00:18:40,729
Grave news, my friends.

273
00:18:40,936 --> 00:18:43,803
Direct your attention to the video screen.

274
00:18:47,543 --> 00:18:50,569
Cable, input, VCR, satellite.

275
00:18:53,649 --> 00:18:57,312
Input, satellite, tape, menu, rewind...

276
00:18:57,486 --> 00:18:58,976
power, on.

277
00:19:02,090 --> 00:19:06,049
It seems that Damian Drake's son
knows about the Blue Monkey...

278
00:19:06,228 --> 00:19:08,662
and he is on his way to Las Vegas.

279
00:19:09,498 --> 00:19:12,899
He must not find the location
of the diamond before we do.

280
00:19:13,936 --> 00:19:15,961
How is the interrogation going?

281
00:19:21,510 --> 00:19:23,603
He's about ready to crack, boss!

282
00:19:30,252 --> 00:19:33,415
Cable, input, VCR and satellite, off.

283
00:19:34,156 --> 00:19:36,522
We cannot let the good guys
win this time, people.

284
00:19:36,625 --> 00:19:38,650
We must capture this son of a spy...

285
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:40,284
and we must locate the diamond...

286
00:19:40,362 --> 00:19:43,195
and use its powers
for our own diabolical ends!

287
00:19:47,169 --> 00:19:49,831
- Copy that to all departments.
- I didn't quite get that.

288
00:19:49,938 --> 00:19:51,303
Didn't quite...

289
00:19:51,773 --> 00:19:53,934
Something about
capturing the son of a spy...

290
00:19:54,009 --> 00:19:56,603
and using the diamond's power
for our diabolical ends.

291
00:19:56,678 --> 00:19:59,511
Be sure and use the laugh.
I like the laugh. Don't you?

292
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:01,549
- And what is your name?
- Mary.

293
00:20:01,650 --> 00:20:03,140
Well, Mary...

294
00:20:04,853 --> 00:20:07,515
how'd you like to do a little kissing later?

295
00:20:09,124 --> 00:20:11,649
That's what they all say at first.

296
00:20:12,794 --> 00:20:16,696
Soon the ACME Corporation
will tower over all of creation!

297
00:20:16,798 --> 00:20:18,231
All of creation!

298
00:20:28,977 --> 00:20:30,410
Wait a minute.

299
00:20:32,547 --> 00:20:34,811
- Yes?
- What about the duck?

300
00:20:41,323 --> 00:20:43,484
Extra crispy.

301
00:20:54,603 --> 00:20:55,934
Hello?

302
00:21:12,421 --> 00:21:15,549
D.J., I'm not here to fire you again.

303
00:21:15,624 --> 00:21:19,583
I just want to know
if that duck told you where he was going.

304
00:22:10,078 --> 00:22:13,844
- Doesn't anyone knock anymore?
- Why are you torturing me?

305
00:22:14,349 --> 00:22:16,681
What have I ever done that...

306
00:22:20,322 --> 00:22:21,482
Great.

307
00:22:22,124 --> 00:22:24,991
I just fired the son of our biggest star.

308
00:22:28,130 --> 00:22:31,031
This has been a career-making day, Kate.

309
00:22:31,133 --> 00:22:33,624
First you get rid of the duck
that everybody hates...

310
00:22:33,702 --> 00:22:36,500
but then, of course,
they all want him back.

311
00:22:37,372 --> 00:22:41,308
And worst of all,
you get into a big fight with Bugs Bunny...

312
00:22:41,376 --> 00:22:45,836
who you revere and who you've tried
to model your life after.

313
00:22:47,449 --> 00:22:50,009
I hate to see a grown man cry.

314
00:22:50,452 --> 00:22:52,613
Especially when it's a girl.

315
00:22:53,155 --> 00:22:55,350
Listen, toots,
would it stop the waterworks...

316
00:22:55,457 --> 00:22:59,359
if I told you Daffy was going to Las Vegas
with that guy D.J.?

317
00:23:01,663 --> 00:23:03,062
It might.

318
00:23:03,298 --> 00:23:07,394
Well, then,
how's about we travel in style in this?

319
00:23:11,339 --> 00:23:13,500
Las Vegas, Jeeves.

320
00:23:14,476 --> 00:23:16,307
Taking you to Las Vegas.

321
00:24:00,755 --> 00:24:03,223
You've got no music in your soul, sister.

322
00:24:03,291 --> 00:24:05,225
I am aware of that, yes.

323
00:24:06,628 --> 00:24:09,529
He sure went for all the extras.
What a maroon.

324
00:24:09,598 --> 00:24:12,260
Don't touch anything.
This is Damian Drake's car...

325
00:24:12,367 --> 00:24:14,096
- Let's see.
- No!

326
00:24:19,474 --> 00:24:21,408
What does this one do?

327
00:24:25,580 --> 00:24:27,639
Shaken, not stirred, sir.

328
00:24:28,817 --> 00:24:30,717
It's 5:00 somewhere.

329
00:24:30,819 --> 00:24:35,119
- lf you touch one more thing...
- I'm about to defy you.

330
00:24:37,125 --> 00:24:39,787
- Now you done it.
- Arms at your side, please.

331
00:24:48,603 --> 00:24:50,503
Formalwear activated.

332
00:24:50,972 --> 00:24:52,963
You clean up nice, kid.

333
00:24:54,776 --> 00:24:55,834
No!

334
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:06,953
Las Vegas!

335
00:25:27,375 --> 00:25:28,603
Smell that, D.J.?

336
00:25:28,677 --> 00:25:31,145
That's the sweet aroma
of money, glamour...

337
00:25:31,213 --> 00:25:34,046
and busload upon busload
of senior citizens.

338
00:25:34,149 --> 00:25:35,946
Cool it, duck. This could be dangerous.

339
00:25:36,017 --> 00:25:39,612
Right, we find Dusty Tails,
save your dad, get the diamond...

340
00:25:39,688 --> 00:25:42,179
apply kung fu liberally as needed.

341
00:25:46,161 --> 00:25:48,152
Under no circumstances are you to allow...

342
00:25:48,230 --> 00:25:51,688
the young Mr. Drake and his duck cohort
out of the casino in one piece.

343
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:53,631
- Is that clear?
- Okay.

344
00:25:53,702 --> 00:25:56,466
You want the varmints
and what they come for.

345
00:25:56,538 --> 00:26:00,406
I got you. But what's in it for old Sam?

346
00:26:10,318 --> 00:26:12,047
I got you.

347
00:26:15,924 --> 00:26:19,724
Did you know that Dusty Tails sang the
theme song to six Damian Drake movies?

348
00:26:19,828 --> 00:26:21,056
I know. He's my father.

349
00:26:21,162 --> 00:26:23,027
- Your dad is Damian Drake?
- Yes!

350
00:26:23,098 --> 00:26:25,191
I'm kidding, relax. We did that.

351
00:26:25,934 --> 00:26:28,198
I say, listen up, y'all.

352
00:26:28,270 --> 00:26:31,603
Please put your greasy,
buffet-shoveling hands together...

353
00:26:31,706 --> 00:26:33,173
for our next act.

354
00:26:33,241 --> 00:26:36,404
If you've heard her before,
you're not here now.

355
00:26:36,511 --> 00:26:38,411
So, I say, let me introduce you...

356
00:26:38,513 --> 00:26:41,607
to Miss Dusty Tails.

357
00:27:17,052 --> 00:27:18,280
Dusty!

358
00:27:19,621 --> 00:27:21,088
Can I talk to you?

359
00:27:30,465 --> 00:27:31,659
What the...

360
00:27:40,742 --> 00:27:41,970
What?

361
00:27:42,744 --> 00:27:44,905
Dusty, I gotta talk to you.

362
00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:48,310
- I'm Damian Drake's son, D.J.
- What?

363
00:27:49,951 --> 00:27:51,942
How do I know it's you?

364
00:27:54,122 --> 00:27:55,680
You are Damian's son.

365
00:27:55,790 --> 00:27:57,781
Is there someplace we can talk?

366
00:27:59,260 --> 00:28:03,321
- Excuse me, I have to change.
- Okay, toots, hand over the diamond.

367
00:28:03,431 --> 00:28:05,956
- He brought a goose?
- It's duck, thank you.

368
00:28:06,701 --> 00:28:08,760
- Hi.
- You again.

369
00:28:08,970 --> 00:28:10,995
Listen up, you darn imbeciles!

370
00:28:11,106 --> 00:28:13,472
We gotta get them varmints
and what they come for!

371
00:28:13,541 --> 00:28:16,840
- And then we blast them?
- Then we blast them.

372
00:28:17,112 --> 00:28:20,013
Now if I were a giant diamond,
where would I be?

373
00:28:20,115 --> 00:28:21,707
Well, not there.

374
00:28:22,684 --> 00:28:24,652
- My dad's in trouble...
- Not here.

375
00:28:24,719 --> 00:28:28,416
...and he said that
I should ask you about the Blue Monkey.

376
00:28:28,990 --> 00:28:31,550
- So then you know?
- Definitely. Yes.

377
00:28:31,659 --> 00:28:34,651
I figured something must have happened
when he didn't show up.

378
00:28:34,729 --> 00:28:37,163
I'm sorry,
but that's what comes with being a spy.

379
00:28:37,232 --> 00:28:41,532
So, you're a spy, too?

380
00:28:42,404 --> 00:28:45,339
The pop diva thing?
That's just one side of me.

381
00:28:45,407 --> 00:28:48,467
I also work for the Agency.
Professional assassin.

382
00:28:48,543 --> 00:28:51,011
It's really hard
trying to juggle the two sometimes.

383
00:28:51,079 --> 00:28:53,206
I don't know what I'll do when I have kids.

384
00:28:53,314 --> 00:28:57,910
Do you know how hard it is to find a nanny
with advance weapons training?

385
00:28:58,052 --> 00:29:01,044
How many galoshes died
to make that little number?

386
00:29:01,156 --> 00:29:03,351
What about this Blue Monkey?

387
00:29:03,425 --> 00:29:06,917
Your father was assigned to track it down
before the chairman could.

388
00:29:07,028 --> 00:29:09,428
The diamond has supernatural powers.

389
00:29:09,531 --> 00:29:12,694
It would be a disaster
if it fell into the wrong hands.

390
00:29:12,767 --> 00:29:15,201
I was supposed to give him this.

391
00:29:15,370 --> 00:29:19,431
This is not a king-sized diamond.
This is a queen of diamonds.

392
00:29:19,541 --> 00:29:21,907
What kind of sick joke is this?

393
00:29:22,076 --> 00:29:23,907
- Can I have that?
- Very funny.

394
00:29:24,012 --> 00:29:25,707
That is so sweet.

395
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:28,212
You trying to take over for your father.

396
00:29:28,283 --> 00:29:30,547
These evil forces? They're bad people.

397
00:29:30,618 --> 00:29:33,781
Relax, sister. I don't know
the meaning of the word "fear."

398
00:29:33,888 --> 00:29:35,378
Say your prayers, duck!

399
00:29:35,457 --> 00:29:37,721
Fear: noun. A state of terror.

400
00:29:38,092 --> 00:29:39,423
Incoming!

401
00:29:49,938 --> 00:29:52,406
This mission
needs years of experience and training.

402
00:29:52,474 --> 00:29:55,807
Maybe. I ain't got time for that right now.
I gotta go save my dad.

403
00:29:55,910 --> 00:29:57,878
Don't lose that card. It's important.

404
00:29:58,046 --> 00:29:59,707
After him, boys!

405
00:30:16,631 --> 00:30:18,394
Easy on the feathers.

406
00:30:18,466 --> 00:30:21,958
Come back here, you card-carrying coyote!

407
00:30:23,771 --> 00:30:26,331
Dadburn slapstick cliche!

408
00:30:26,841 --> 00:30:30,504
Faster! Climb like my life depended on it.

409
00:30:33,448 --> 00:30:35,006
You run, I'll steer.

410
00:30:35,116 --> 00:30:37,914
Right! I mean, left. Your other left.

411
00:30:42,991 --> 00:30:45,289
That's what I'm talking about!

412
00:30:47,061 --> 00:30:48,892
Is that all you got?

413
00:30:49,931 --> 00:30:52,058
That's gonna leave a mark.

414
00:30:54,502 --> 00:30:56,936
That's not boxing. Bite his ear!

415
00:31:00,074 --> 00:31:03,237
Left and a right and a left and a right-left!

416
00:31:06,180 --> 00:31:08,273
I'm gonna come up on you.

417
00:31:16,925 --> 00:31:19,155
I'll take that playing card.

418
00:31:26,801 --> 00:31:28,962
- After it, stunt boy.
- Man.

419
00:31:29,037 --> 00:31:30,197
Jump!

420
00:31:49,290 --> 00:31:51,815
All right, when I say,
place your bets, gentlemen.

421
00:31:51,893 --> 00:31:55,454
Money plays, loser stays.
Everyone's a... Not everyone.

422
00:31:55,530 --> 00:31:57,896
Here's my money. Now play.

423
00:31:58,232 --> 00:32:00,063
- Card, sir?
- Hit me.

424
00:32:00,168 --> 00:32:03,228
Don't you want to
look at your cards first, son?

425
00:32:03,338 --> 00:32:06,136
Boy's about as sharp as a bowling ball.

426
00:32:06,374 --> 00:32:08,535
- Hit me.
- No, hit me first!

427
00:32:08,643 --> 00:32:10,838
I said await your turn, sir.

428
00:32:10,912 --> 00:32:12,174
Hit me.

429
00:32:18,553 --> 00:32:22,216
No, hit me, fragnabbit!

430
00:32:23,758 --> 00:32:26,488
- He's the boss.
- You son of a...

431
00:32:26,561 --> 00:32:27,926
Card, sir?

432
00:32:28,563 --> 00:32:29,825
Hit me.

433
00:32:29,998 --> 00:32:31,863
Twenty-one, a winner!

434
00:32:31,933 --> 00:32:33,264
Let's go!

435
00:32:35,770 --> 00:32:38,568
"And then they made their heroic escape!"

436
00:32:44,512 --> 00:32:47,777
I say we do Cirque du Soleil
and call it a night.

437
00:32:49,217 --> 00:32:51,481
How about the Liberace Museum?

438
00:32:54,489 --> 00:32:57,822
All right, let's see what this baby
can really do.

439
00:33:04,499 --> 00:33:06,490
Now, that's an interesting feature.

440
00:33:06,567 --> 00:33:09,331
Come back, you absconders!

441
00:33:09,604 --> 00:33:11,538
Watch yourself, ma'am.

442
00:33:12,407 --> 00:33:14,398
I love this rug.

443
00:33:14,776 --> 00:33:18,177
- Come back here, you varmints!
- Run. Move. Go.

444
00:33:23,017 --> 00:33:24,348
Nice car.

445
00:33:24,585 --> 00:33:26,075
Don't hit me.

446
00:33:26,721 --> 00:33:30,179
It's a modified Chevrolet
with a big 24 on the side.

447
00:33:35,263 --> 00:33:39,131
Out of the way, fancy boy.
I'm a-commandeering this here clown car.

448
00:33:39,233 --> 00:33:40,962
After them, boys!

449
00:33:41,069 --> 00:33:42,366
Shotgun!

450
00:33:43,938 --> 00:33:46,907
Rag-flagging ragtag sidekicks!

451
00:33:48,976 --> 00:33:51,774
Slow down, will you? I'm waddling here.

452
00:33:51,879 --> 00:33:54,643
Come back, you darn idiot galoots!

453
00:33:59,487 --> 00:34:03,890
There's gotta be 314 hotels
and 142 casinos in Las Vegas.

454
00:34:03,958 --> 00:34:06,119
We are never going to find that duck.

455
00:34:10,765 --> 00:34:12,790
Daff never misses a cue.

456
00:34:19,841 --> 00:34:22,332
- What's up, duck?
- Don't you start with me.

457
00:34:22,977 --> 00:34:24,342
Excuse me.

458
00:34:25,446 --> 00:34:26,640
You!

459
00:34:26,748 --> 00:34:27,806
- You.
- Him.

460
00:34:27,915 --> 00:34:29,143
- Her.
- Them!

461
00:34:29,250 --> 00:34:30,649
Out of my way!

462
00:34:34,822 --> 00:34:36,414
Dagnabbit!

463
00:34:36,524 --> 00:34:40,153
- You are in big trouble, mister.
- Agreed!

464
00:34:45,466 --> 00:34:46,490
Out!

465
00:34:46,601 --> 00:34:49,297
What are you doing, kidnapping me?
Stop the car.

466
00:34:49,370 --> 00:34:51,304
This is my adventure, bub.

467
00:34:58,212 --> 00:34:59,509
Coming through.

468
00:35:03,985 --> 00:35:07,352
What brings you to Las Vegas?
You ran out of people to fire in L.A.?

469
00:35:07,455 --> 00:35:09,082
You stole my duck.

470
00:35:09,157 --> 00:35:12,786
- Your duck? I belong to the world.
- You know what? You can have him.

471
00:35:22,470 --> 00:35:25,337
Dynamite? Who has dynamite?

472
00:35:25,706 --> 00:35:27,105
Welcome to my world.

473
00:35:29,110 --> 00:35:30,134
Hang on.

474
00:35:42,657 --> 00:35:44,887
Throw it out the window. Throw it out!

475
00:35:44,992 --> 00:35:48,223
- But innocent people could be hurt.
- Throw it out the window!

476
00:35:48,329 --> 00:35:50,991
It will send the wrong message
to children.

477
00:36:06,881 --> 00:36:09,145
Didn't he used to be behind us?

478
00:36:23,164 --> 00:36:25,894
We're having duck tonight, boys.

479
00:36:26,534 --> 00:36:30,368
Just a suggestion, but all those in favor
of not hitting that wall say "aye."

480
00:36:30,438 --> 00:36:32,201
- Aye!
- Mother.

481
00:36:32,540 --> 00:36:33,905
Taking you to Mother.

482
00:36:58,699 --> 00:37:02,567
Look, a shooting star.
Quick, everybody make a wish.

483
00:37:03,971 --> 00:37:07,907
You know, I'm beginning to think
that this one is the spy car.

484
00:37:07,975 --> 00:37:08,703
What?

485
00:37:10,912 --> 00:37:13,574
ETA to Mother, 10 minutes.

486
00:37:26,093 --> 00:37:29,756
Please return your seatbacks
to their full and upright position.

487
00:37:29,864 --> 00:37:33,027
So, what are your plans now, if I may ask?

488
00:37:33,100 --> 00:37:35,534
Daffy will save us. He's the hero.

489
00:37:35,603 --> 00:37:37,696
All right, bucktooth. Stick a carrot in it.

490
00:37:37,772 --> 00:37:41,105
Everybody calm down, all right?
I can handle this.

491
00:37:53,287 --> 00:37:54,879
Sell my Warner Brothers stock.

492
00:37:54,956 --> 00:37:57,948
I got an inside tip
that Bugs Bunny is about to die.

493
00:38:04,598 --> 00:38:05,963
Out of gas.

494
00:38:06,467 --> 00:38:09,265
What? It doesn't work like that.

495
00:38:12,306 --> 00:38:13,671
Thanks, toots.

496
00:38:25,686 --> 00:38:27,517
- Carrot?
- No, thanks.

497
00:38:33,594 --> 00:38:37,690
You really think that playing card
is going to help you rescue your father?

498
00:38:37,798 --> 00:38:39,197
Yeah, I do.

499
00:38:40,001 --> 00:38:42,799
You know this all sounds insane, right?

500
00:38:47,174 --> 00:38:50,769
I remember the first time
I saw your dad in the movies.

501
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:54,609
So breathtaking.

502
00:39:01,122 --> 00:39:03,022
Your hair smells nice.

503
00:39:04,225 --> 00:39:08,628
- You say something?
- No, just saying good night.

504
00:39:10,564 --> 00:39:11,997
I'm telling you, Daffy...

505
00:39:12,066 --> 00:39:15,126
I heard the Warner Brothers say
you were their best duck.

506
00:39:15,202 --> 00:39:18,194
Flattered though I may be,
flattened I will not...

507
00:39:18,305 --> 00:39:20,136
in order for you to get the laughs.

508
00:39:20,207 --> 00:39:22,641
It's all... And then...

509
00:39:24,145 --> 00:39:27,137
- And your tail is on fire.
- Exactly my point.

510
00:39:27,214 --> 00:39:29,705
No, really, your tail's on fire.

511
00:39:33,054 --> 00:39:35,045
Daff, you're accident-prone.

512
00:39:36,223 --> 00:39:38,020
What am I talking to you for?

513
00:39:38,125 --> 00:39:42,653
All you have to do is munch on a carrot,
and people love you.

514
00:39:50,236 --> 00:39:54,172
I need you to move my 12:00 appointment
up to 2:00 and then back to 11:00.

515
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:58,006
Then just cancel it.
And I need you to get a helicopter and...

516
00:39:58,077 --> 00:40:00,170
No, don't put me on hold.

517
00:40:01,046 --> 00:40:02,172
Oh, God.

518
00:40:04,049 --> 00:40:07,018
I can't die out here.

519
00:40:07,186 --> 00:40:09,017
This wasn't the plan.

520
00:40:09,188 --> 00:40:11,918
After this comedy...

521
00:40:13,692 --> 00:40:15,922
I promised myself
I would only do real movies...

522
00:40:16,028 --> 00:40:19,691
about the human condition
crammed with social relevance.

523
00:40:20,766 --> 00:40:24,702
There's nothing but a big rock
for 10 miles in that, that...

524
00:40:24,904 --> 00:40:26,929
that, and that direction.

525
00:40:30,042 --> 00:40:31,270
I say we go that way.

526
00:40:31,377 --> 00:40:35,177
Say, who are you kidding here?
We're goners!

527
00:40:35,247 --> 00:40:37,408
Water! I can't die now.

528
00:40:37,516 --> 00:40:41,714
Think of the millions of children
who want me to have the diamond.

529
00:40:41,787 --> 00:40:43,550
The poor children!

530
00:40:44,190 --> 00:40:45,248
Look at that.

531
00:40:48,527 --> 00:40:51,394
Is it a mirage? Or just product placement?

532
00:40:51,530 --> 00:40:54,931
Who cares? With shopping convenience
at such low prices.

533
00:40:55,034 --> 00:40:58,435
Water, Fresca, Mountain Dew.
Your product name here.

534
00:40:59,705 --> 00:41:01,434
Is this your idea?

535
00:41:03,776 --> 00:41:04,970
The audience expects it.

536
00:41:05,077 --> 00:41:08,376
They don't even notice
this kind of thing anymore.

537
00:41:11,083 --> 00:41:13,711
Nice of Wal-Mart
to provide these Wal-Mart beverages...

538
00:41:13,786 --> 00:41:16,880
in return for us saying "Wal-Mart"
so many times.

539
00:41:21,727 --> 00:41:23,592
Where's Yosemite Sam?

540
00:41:24,163 --> 00:41:26,688
- What is your report?
- Boss, it wasn't me.

541
00:41:26,765 --> 00:41:30,360
That razzan-frazzan duck
and that crazy son D. J...

542
00:41:30,436 --> 00:41:32,802
and a humina-humina Dusty Tails.

543
00:41:34,106 --> 00:41:36,734
You know, that makes a lot of sense.

544
00:41:36,809 --> 00:41:38,208
Thank you.

545
00:41:41,747 --> 00:41:46,207
Mr. Drake, are you going to save us
the bother of eliminating your son?

546
00:41:46,285 --> 00:41:49,083
My son is going to kick your evil butt.

547
00:41:50,256 --> 00:41:52,281
- Mr. Chairman.
- Yes, Dad.

548
00:41:52,424 --> 00:41:55,222
- Desert operative.
- No.

549
00:41:55,961 --> 00:41:57,792
Not a bad idea, Dad.

550
00:41:58,564 --> 00:42:01,260
Our desert operative is due for a win.

551
00:42:15,681 --> 00:42:18,741
I told you we should have
made that left turn at Albuquerque.

552
00:42:18,817 --> 00:42:20,808
Don't start that again.

553
00:42:52,718 --> 00:42:54,345
All right. Here's the plan.

554
00:42:54,453 --> 00:42:58,389
We wait here for the next truck or car
or camel or whatever...

555
00:42:58,490 --> 00:43:00,720
and take Bugs and Daffy...

556
00:43:00,826 --> 00:43:03,124
get back to Hollywood
and finish making the movie.

557
00:43:03,195 --> 00:43:04,822
What are you going to do?

558
00:43:04,897 --> 00:43:08,663
- I'm just gonna keep walking that way.
- That's your plan?

559
00:43:10,636 --> 00:43:13,628
Yep. That's the direction
the car was going.

560
00:43:21,647 --> 00:43:25,174
You're not leaving me here
while you make off with my diamond.

561
00:43:39,131 --> 00:43:41,531
I don't wanna get too wrapped up
in your caper...

562
00:43:41,633 --> 00:43:45,399
but let's assume that you're right
and Damian Drake is a spy?

563
00:43:45,504 --> 00:43:46,835
Super spy.

564
00:43:47,673 --> 00:43:51,632
What's the point of just meandering
through the desert if...

565
00:43:56,482 --> 00:43:57,574
Here.

566
00:43:58,984 --> 00:44:00,212
Be safe.

567
00:44:00,319 --> 00:44:03,015
- Attaboy. Trust your instincts.
- Yeah.

568
00:44:03,088 --> 00:44:07,252
Except for the water tower, the Batmobile,
the rubble known as Las Vegas.

569
00:44:07,993 --> 00:44:12,225
There's nobody as rich, famous,
and powerful as my father...

570
00:44:12,331 --> 00:44:14,993
who just disappears into thin air.

571
00:44:20,239 --> 00:44:23,731
Suddenly I feel like
I'm in Aunt Marge's Jell-O mold.

572
00:44:24,209 --> 00:44:27,201
Guys, it's air-conditioned in here.
Come on in.

573
00:44:29,848 --> 00:44:31,509
Intruder alert.

574
00:44:51,904 --> 00:44:53,098
Easy.

575
00:45:00,412 --> 00:45:01,538
Earth freak.

576
00:45:06,985 --> 00:45:10,819
Okay, buster. Where's Damian Drake
and that big diamond?

577
00:45:13,759 --> 00:45:16,057
Cleanup on aisle three.

578
00:45:16,562 --> 00:45:18,393
Can I be of service?

579
00:45:18,464 --> 00:45:21,956
I am monitored to respond
to the name Robbie.

580
00:45:22,067 --> 00:45:23,261
Hi, D.J.

581
00:45:24,570 --> 00:45:27,004
At ease. I'm Mother.

582
00:45:27,973 --> 00:45:31,067
Yeah, like the car said
that we would be meeting you.

583
00:45:31,143 --> 00:45:32,633
How do you know my name?

584
00:45:32,811 --> 00:45:35,746
D.J., I've known you
since you were this big.

585
00:45:37,416 --> 00:45:39,941
That's not really possible, is it?

586
00:45:40,085 --> 00:45:41,950
Must have been a photo.

587
00:45:42,054 --> 00:45:45,114
Let me just take care of this, and we'II...

588
00:45:46,792 --> 00:45:49,556
Give it to me straight. How bad is it?

589
00:45:49,628 --> 00:45:51,323
So, shall we?

590
00:45:52,231 --> 00:45:54,222
So little to do, so much time.

591
00:45:54,299 --> 00:45:58,292
You're going to put him back, right?
I can't go back to L.A. with duck soup.

592
00:45:58,403 --> 00:46:02,772
We do have the facilities
to reconstitute the body.

593
00:46:02,841 --> 00:46:05,776
The mind though,
will remain a gooey mess.

594
00:46:06,478 --> 00:46:08,309
So, about my father?

595
00:46:08,814 --> 00:46:12,113
All in due time. Lovely. Yes. Blow.

596
00:46:12,184 --> 00:46:16,678
All right, break it up, fellas. Nice coats.
White is the new black, you know.

597
00:46:16,788 --> 00:46:17,846
Yes.

598
00:46:18,790 --> 00:46:19,848
Look.

599
00:46:19,958 --> 00:46:22,483
- So this is Area 51, right?
- No.

600
00:46:22,594 --> 00:46:25,620
The secret military base
where they keep the aliens?

601
00:46:25,697 --> 00:46:29,963
No, Area 51 is actually
a paranoid fantasy we concocted...

602
00:46:30,035 --> 00:46:32,970
to hide the true identity of this facility.

603
00:46:33,038 --> 00:46:35,632
- Which is?
- Area 52.

604
00:46:36,108 --> 00:46:38,008
But don't quote me on that.

605
00:46:38,110 --> 00:46:40,305
Oh, right. Area 52.

606
00:46:43,382 --> 00:46:46,215
- So, Mother...
- Call me "Mom."

607
00:46:46,852 --> 00:46:50,151
Mom, what is it
that you do here exactly, anyway?

608
00:46:50,222 --> 00:46:54,784
Creation, transubstantiation, destruction.
It's stressful. All kinds of things.

609
00:46:54,860 --> 00:46:57,795
They're already here. You're next.

610
00:46:59,865 --> 00:47:00,627
My God...

611
00:47:01,099 --> 00:47:01,997
what am I going to do with you?

612
00:47:02,067 --> 00:47:03,557
You've done nothing but screw up!

613
00:47:03,635 --> 00:47:06,627
You've walked off mesas.
You've been smashed by boulders.

614
00:47:06,705 --> 00:47:08,468
You've been run over by diesel trucks.

615
00:47:08,540 --> 00:47:11,873
Don't blame the equipment. It's good.
It's ACME equipment.

616
00:47:11,977 --> 00:47:14,468
You're a coyote. Be wily.

617
00:47:15,480 --> 00:47:18,972
All right, now.
Buck up and let's see a little smile.

618
00:47:20,586 --> 00:47:22,144
Little bigger.

619
00:47:25,824 --> 00:47:27,257
That's nice.

620
00:47:27,693 --> 00:47:32,153
Now, just go take a shower,
and don't come back till you smell better!

621
00:47:32,397 --> 00:47:37,266
Be careful. There're men moving a safe
out there, and I don't want you to...

622
00:47:37,936 --> 00:47:41,235
And be careful
of the box of fireworks because...

623
00:47:43,508 --> 00:47:47,000
I suppose I should mention
the plate-glass window...

624
00:47:50,682 --> 00:47:52,809
It's tough being the boss.

625
00:47:57,356 --> 00:47:59,017
A communication.

626
00:47:59,091 --> 00:48:00,649
Memo to Marvin the Martian.

627
00:48:03,895 --> 00:48:06,557
Obtain the playing card,
and destroy the duck.

628
00:48:06,665 --> 00:48:11,500
And when I say destroy the duck,
I mean kill him viciously and painfully.

629
00:48:11,937 --> 00:48:15,771
A mission? I'm all a-tingle.

630
00:48:16,241 --> 00:48:20,109
So, here we are
in the l-can't-tell-you-what room.

631
00:48:20,212 --> 00:48:23,739
- Robert, can you take care of that, please?
- Yes, madam.

632
00:48:24,082 --> 00:48:27,017
When you bring Daffy back,
could you make him 20% funnier?

633
00:48:27,085 --> 00:48:29,952
- I heard that.
- What were we discussing?

634
00:48:30,055 --> 00:48:32,353
This isn't about the giant ants, is it?

635
00:48:32,424 --> 00:48:37,123
- Giant ants?
- Because they're not really ants anymore.

636
00:48:37,929 --> 00:48:40,261
Tell me about the Blue Monkey.

637
00:48:41,199 --> 00:48:45,602
How do you know about that thing
that I've never heard of in my entire life?

638
00:48:46,972 --> 00:48:48,564
My dad told me.

639
00:48:48,907 --> 00:48:52,934
What is the point
of making them pinky swear?

640
00:48:54,112 --> 00:48:55,977
All right.

641
00:48:57,049 --> 00:48:59,040
Now this tape will explain everything.

642
00:48:59,117 --> 00:49:02,109
It was prepared especially for your father.

643
00:49:05,757 --> 00:49:07,418
Greetings, Damian Drake.

644
00:49:07,492 --> 00:49:12,054
If you are watching this, you are aware
that the world is in grave danger.

645
00:49:12,130 --> 00:49:16,430
The ACME Corporation is in hot pursuit
of the Blue Monkey diamond...

646
00:49:16,501 --> 00:49:20,961
a supernatural gem with the ability
to turn people into monkeys...

647
00:49:21,073 --> 00:49:22,335
and then back again.

648
00:49:22,441 --> 00:49:25,604
It is the ACME chairman's goal
to turn the population...

649
00:49:25,677 --> 00:49:29,909
into monkey slaves
to manufacture shoddy ACME goods...

650
00:49:29,981 --> 00:49:32,677
and then change them back to people
to buy the stuff.

651
00:49:33,785 --> 00:49:35,252
Unbelievable.

652
00:49:35,320 --> 00:49:37,015
Unbelievable, you may say.

653
00:49:37,122 --> 00:49:41,616
Your mission is this:
Find it, destroy it, save humanity.

654
00:49:43,028 --> 00:49:45,861
And remember,
no one wants to be turned into a monkey.

655
00:49:50,635 --> 00:49:52,193
So that's why.

656
00:49:52,871 --> 00:49:57,467
Those guys came after my dad
because he was going to save the world.

657
00:49:58,110 --> 00:50:01,807
So that means if I go after the diamond,
then the bad guys come after me.

658
00:50:01,913 --> 00:50:04,939
Hang on.
You're not seriously thinking about...

659
00:50:05,016 --> 00:50:07,780
Taking over your father's mission?

660
00:50:09,287 --> 00:50:11,517
- I guess that would be all right.
- What?

661
00:50:11,623 --> 00:50:16,117
Listen, if you're going to be a spy,
you'll need spy stuff.

662
00:50:16,795 --> 00:50:20,526
So, is this where you keep
all the high-tech spy gadgets?

663
00:50:23,101 --> 00:50:24,193
Yes.

664
00:50:27,806 --> 00:50:30,104
That's cool. So I get to use all this stuff?

665
00:50:30,175 --> 00:50:33,303
No, your stuff is over here.

666
00:50:35,347 --> 00:50:36,939
But I really like the...

667
00:50:37,015 --> 00:50:40,712
All right. Looks like an ordinary cell phone.

668
00:50:41,019 --> 00:50:45,149
Three-way calling, voice dialing,
downloadable ringtones.

669
00:50:45,557 --> 00:50:49,391
- My phone does all that.
- Superconducting electromagnet.

670
00:50:50,662 --> 00:50:52,323
- Sorry.
- It's all right.

671
00:50:52,397 --> 00:50:55,059
GPS with mapping software...

672
00:50:55,167 --> 00:50:57,863
tip calculator, Gameboy.

673
00:50:57,969 --> 00:50:59,197
Gameboy?

674
00:51:00,572 --> 00:51:02,335
High-powered laser.

675
00:51:02,407 --> 00:51:06,867
Polycarbonate rappelling line
with jet-propelled micro grappling hook.

676
00:51:07,179 --> 00:51:09,875
Nose hair trimmer.
You always want to look your best.

677
00:51:09,981 --> 00:51:13,712
Get over here, you idiot.
No, cold. Cold. Warm, warmer.

678
00:51:17,923 --> 00:51:19,584
Permit me, madam.

679
00:51:19,724 --> 00:51:22,488
Robert, darling. Excellent choice.

680
00:51:22,561 --> 00:51:23,994
Swank pants.

681
00:51:24,229 --> 00:51:26,060
And comfortable, too.

682
00:51:26,164 --> 00:51:30,567
Plus, liquid hydrogen rocket pockets,
here and here.

683
00:51:30,669 --> 00:51:33,729
And stitching,
nuclear-powered crotch pad...

684
00:51:35,373 --> 00:51:37,034
He'll be down in a moment.

685
00:51:40,712 --> 00:51:42,373
Wakey, wakey, friends.

686
00:51:42,447 --> 00:51:45,416
Time to wreak mayhem
in the cause of evil.

687
00:51:47,752 --> 00:51:51,779
Mother, just one last question.
What's the deal with this card?

688
00:51:53,058 --> 00:51:56,221
That is the window
into what lies behind her smile.

689
00:51:56,294 --> 00:51:57,454
What?

690
00:51:57,562 --> 00:52:01,589
I'm sorry, our intelligence people
feel a need to code everything in a riddle.

691
00:52:01,700 --> 00:52:06,399
They get some kind of perverse pleasure
out of it. I think it's corporate.

692
00:52:06,938 --> 00:52:08,371
All humans.

693
00:52:09,074 --> 00:52:11,167
Looks like we got company.

694
00:52:15,580 --> 00:52:17,172
Illegal aliens.

695
00:52:19,184 --> 00:52:20,549
Exterminate them.

696
00:52:20,619 --> 00:52:24,180
Darn. I knew this day would come.

697
00:52:25,357 --> 00:52:28,053
Let us exterminate them.

698
00:52:32,898 --> 00:52:37,028
Emergency shutdown activated.
Force-barrier seal in 30 seconds.

699
00:52:37,102 --> 00:52:38,569
Exterminate.

700
00:52:41,273 --> 00:52:43,366
The playing card, please.

701
00:52:43,441 --> 00:52:46,774
I'll take that. Out of my way.
Hero coming through.

702
00:52:47,879 --> 00:52:49,608
There is no escape.

703
00:52:54,719 --> 00:52:56,482
You pesky fowl!

704
00:53:08,600 --> 00:53:13,162
Isn't it about time to enjoy a frosty,
cold soda at the concession stand?

705
00:53:13,939 --> 00:53:15,566
Exterminate!

706
00:53:16,474 --> 00:53:18,635
Get the lead out. Bus is leaving.

707
00:53:20,312 --> 00:53:22,405
Halt or be fricasseed.

708
00:53:30,355 --> 00:53:31,822
That was fun.

709
00:53:31,923 --> 00:53:33,584
Looking for this?

710
00:53:36,595 --> 00:53:38,859
Now, what did she mean by a window?

711
00:53:39,965 --> 00:53:42,866
The window into what lies
behind her smile.

712
00:53:44,603 --> 00:53:46,036
That's the Mona Lisa.

713
00:53:46,137 --> 00:53:49,129
- Which is in the Louvre.
- Which is in Paris.

714
00:53:49,774 --> 00:53:52,368
Just how are we supposed to get to Paris?

715
00:53:52,544 --> 00:53:53,806
Like this.

716
00:54:24,009 --> 00:54:26,477
It doesn't look like
much of a window to me.

717
00:54:26,544 --> 00:54:28,478
Maybe the diamond is in the painting.

718
00:54:28,546 --> 00:54:31,709
- All we have to do is steal the Mona Lisa.
- Way ahead of you.

719
00:54:33,151 --> 00:54:36,177
- No, you look, you don't touch, right?
- Yeah.

720
00:54:36,321 --> 00:54:38,118
But I'm already in costume.

721
00:54:38,189 --> 00:54:40,555
- That's a good look for you.
- Do you think so?

722
00:54:40,659 --> 00:54:42,183
Wait a minute.

723
00:54:51,803 --> 00:54:53,361
It is a window.

724
00:54:56,808 --> 00:54:58,298
It's an X-ray.

725
00:54:59,344 --> 00:55:00,538
Sorry.

726
00:55:03,314 --> 00:55:06,249
It's a map of Africa.
Maybe that's where the diamond is.

727
00:55:06,351 --> 00:55:08,148
Hold it up. I'll take a picture.

728
00:55:08,319 --> 00:55:10,150
Can I take a picture? Please?

729
00:55:10,221 --> 00:55:13,213
Come on, give me your phone.
I want to take a picture, too.

730
00:55:13,324 --> 00:55:15,087
Cheese it, the cops.

731
00:55:18,229 --> 00:55:19,321
He's gone.

732
00:55:19,397 --> 00:55:22,696
So let me take a picture, will you?
I want to take a picture, too.

733
00:55:22,767 --> 00:55:25,895
Come on, please? Can I hold the window?
Let me see the window.

734
00:55:26,004 --> 00:55:27,562
I'll take that!

735
00:55:29,441 --> 00:55:32,376
What gives, doc?
We made 35 pictures together.

736
00:55:33,044 --> 00:55:35,535
As it turns out, I'm secretly evil.

737
00:55:35,914 --> 00:55:37,438
That's show biz for you.

738
00:55:37,549 --> 00:55:41,280
Now make with the card,
so I can please my dark masters.

739
00:55:41,386 --> 00:55:43,513
Yes, sir. Queen of diamonds is your card.

740
00:55:43,588 --> 00:55:47,183
Just put it back in the deck,
anywhere is fine. And oopsie-daisy!

741
00:55:47,258 --> 00:55:50,193
- Is this your card?
- No.

742
00:55:50,261 --> 00:55:53,230
- This?
- No.

743
00:55:54,265 --> 00:55:57,200
- Run. This?
- No.

744
00:55:57,268 --> 00:55:59,736
I said it's the queen of diamonds,
I tell you.

745
00:55:59,804 --> 00:56:01,396
You mean, like this one?

746
00:56:05,310 --> 00:56:07,278
Think we should go back and help him?

747
00:56:07,378 --> 00:56:10,279
Elmer never gets Bugs.
It's a formula, but it works.

748
00:56:10,381 --> 00:56:13,475
The great thing about movies,
you always know what will happen.

749
00:56:13,585 --> 00:56:15,280
For instance, if this was a movie...

750
00:56:15,386 --> 00:56:17,980
you and I'd probably wind up together.

751
00:56:22,594 --> 00:56:24,585
If you don't let go of me, I'll scream...

752
00:56:24,662 --> 00:56:26,857
but I'm not gonna stop screaming!

753
00:56:44,949 --> 00:56:47,144
Well, this is surreal.

754
00:56:47,385 --> 00:56:51,788
Stop or I'll fire.

755
00:57:27,592 --> 00:57:28,786
Hello.

756
00:57:30,695 --> 00:57:31,957
Oh, my.

757
00:57:33,298 --> 00:57:34,822
Ladies, please.

758
00:57:50,348 --> 00:57:51,542
Gendarme!

759
00:57:53,484 --> 00:57:56,385
- Oui, monsieur?
- There's a man there. He's got a woman.

760
00:57:56,487 --> 00:58:00,014
She's tied up in a burlap sack.
He's taking her to the Eiffel Tower.

761
00:58:00,124 --> 00:58:02,456
It is spring, is it not?

762
00:58:20,879 --> 00:58:22,676
I'm gonna blast you.

763
00:58:32,557 --> 00:58:33,888
Shucks.

764
00:58:48,139 --> 00:58:52,405
"Pointillism: A technique
of using individual dots of pigment...

765
00:58:52,510 --> 00:58:55,479
"which, taken together, make an image."

766
00:58:56,047 --> 00:58:57,378
Oh, crud.

767
00:58:59,250 --> 00:59:02,981
I think when you go to the movies,
you should learn something.

768
00:59:18,603 --> 00:59:21,595
Pardonnez-moi. Excusez-moi.

769
00:59:43,261 --> 00:59:45,456
Look at that clown here.

770
00:59:45,563 --> 00:59:48,293
Now, there's something
you don't see every day.

771
00:59:49,367 --> 00:59:50,459
You.

772
00:59:51,736 --> 00:59:52,896
Come here.

773
00:59:52,971 --> 00:59:54,097
Wait a minute.

774
00:59:54,205 --> 00:59:56,298
- I don't want any trouble.
- What are you doing?

775
00:59:56,407 --> 00:59:58,637
I just want your pants!

776
01:00:03,314 --> 01:00:06,772
That's right. I'm a vicious bird of prey.

777
01:00:12,557 --> 01:00:13,649
Merci.

778
01:00:44,222 --> 01:00:46,281
He's got the camera!

779
01:00:59,137 --> 01:01:00,764
Give the girl back!

780
01:01:49,353 --> 01:01:51,981
- What kept you?
- You okay?

781
01:01:52,390 --> 01:01:53,789
That was great.

782
01:02:00,832 --> 01:02:04,461
I'd say it's a perfect day.
Except for the fact that we lost the map.

783
01:02:04,535 --> 01:02:07,629
- We?
- All right, I'm the jerk who lost the map.

784
01:02:07,705 --> 01:02:10,868
And I'm the bunny
who saved the card. Voila.

785
01:02:12,043 --> 01:02:13,704
Nice going, Bugs.

786
01:02:16,080 --> 01:02:17,240
Africa.

787
01:02:18,049 --> 01:02:20,244
Chair people, I reveal to you...

788
01:02:20,351 --> 01:02:23,081
the whereabouts of the Blue Monkey.

789
01:02:28,159 --> 01:02:29,319
All right.

790
01:02:32,396 --> 01:02:36,093
There's a duck in the middle of the map.
Remove the duck.

791
01:02:36,367 --> 01:02:39,859
Remove the duck! The duck is in the...

792
01:02:40,104 --> 01:02:41,230
Duck!

793
01:02:49,514 --> 01:02:53,917
We cannot let a boy, girl, duck, and rabbit
thwart our plans for global domination.

794
01:02:54,018 --> 01:02:56,418
- Wanna bet?
- A wager?

795
01:02:56,687 --> 01:03:01,351
$5 says my son will scuttle
your diabolical plans and save the world.

796
01:03:01,559 --> 01:03:04,426
You're awfully spunky
for a man in your position.

797
01:03:05,630 --> 01:03:08,599
How do you like that,
Mr. Slap Yourself in Your Own Face?

798
01:03:08,699 --> 01:03:10,758
Give him a good zets
every once in a while.

799
01:03:10,868 --> 01:03:12,358
My pleasure.

800
01:03:12,436 --> 01:03:15,132
Now, I think I'm going to hedge my bet.

801
01:03:15,239 --> 01:03:18,140
I'm going to unleash
our most vicious operative.

802
01:03:27,585 --> 01:03:32,386
Mr. Chairman, while we agree
that the Tasmanian Devil is quite vicious...

803
01:03:32,590 --> 01:03:36,321
if memory serves, he is also really stupid.

804
01:03:36,594 --> 01:03:39,062
Really? So are you.

805
01:03:47,138 --> 01:03:48,571
That's a good boy.

806
01:03:54,178 --> 01:03:56,237
I withdraw my objection.

807
01:04:11,996 --> 01:04:14,521
This would have been
a lot easier underground.

808
01:04:14,632 --> 01:04:19,035
Come on, it's only another 6,000 cubits
in this here thick direction.

809
01:04:24,942 --> 01:04:28,139
Look, Granny,
it's that nice boy from next door.

810
01:04:28,679 --> 01:04:30,374
Little Damian.

811
01:04:30,715 --> 01:04:33,206
How funny seeing you here, dear.

812
01:04:33,484 --> 01:04:34,678
Hi, Granny.

813
01:04:34,785 --> 01:04:37,720
Would you and your little friends
like a lift?

814
01:04:38,489 --> 01:04:40,150
Giddyup, Dumbo.

815
01:04:41,125 --> 01:04:44,617
Sure was a lucky coincidence
you showing up just now.

816
01:04:44,829 --> 01:04:46,888
Yes, wasn't it?

817
01:05:05,683 --> 01:05:07,480
I've discovered my roots.

818
01:05:07,551 --> 01:05:09,644
I've discovered my lunch.

819
01:05:15,526 --> 01:05:17,153
Cry freedom!

820
01:05:29,273 --> 01:05:31,207
What a fantastic view.

821
01:05:31,375 --> 01:05:32,842
Unless you're in the audience...

822
01:05:32,910 --> 01:05:36,937
in which case you've been staring
at an elephant's behind for 30 seconds.

823
01:05:39,417 --> 01:05:41,282
My destiny awaits.

824
01:05:47,258 --> 01:05:48,623
I guess this is our stop.

825
01:05:48,726 --> 01:05:51,718
Enjoy the rest of your adventure, children.

826
01:06:18,622 --> 01:06:22,251
This is the Blue Monkey?
This dime-store bauble?

827
01:06:23,327 --> 01:06:26,728
- I've been rooked. Shafted by the gods.
- Nice going, Daffy.

828
01:06:26,797 --> 01:06:29,960
I demand recompense.
I want my diamond.

829
01:06:30,167 --> 01:06:32,761
Where is my humongous rock?

830
01:06:36,273 --> 01:06:37,570
Pressed duck.

831
01:06:48,185 --> 01:06:50,949
- This looks like a puzzle piece.
- What?

832
01:06:51,689 --> 01:06:53,520
Wait a minute.

833
01:07:14,678 --> 01:07:16,339
Are we rich yet?

834
01:07:17,548 --> 01:07:18,879
Any time now.

835
01:07:54,518 --> 01:07:57,749
I'm rich. I'm affluent.
My liquidity is assured.

836
01:08:00,024 --> 01:08:02,754
Daffy, get back here. Don't touch that!

837
01:08:03,093 --> 01:08:04,754
Let go! Don't you dare!

838
01:08:04,862 --> 01:08:07,490
- The rock is mine. So close.
- You mind?

839
01:08:07,565 --> 01:08:10,864
Yes, I mind. I'm the hero.
I should get the treasure.

840
01:08:10,935 --> 01:08:13,597
The girl, too, but we'll discuss that later.

841
01:08:16,407 --> 01:08:20,366
Careful with my diamond. Easy, now.

842
01:08:28,452 --> 01:08:31,353
Dad, this is for you.

843
01:08:38,028 --> 01:08:41,930
Why, D.J., why you? Why wasn't it me?

844
01:08:42,399 --> 01:08:45,027
Just academic curiosity, you understand.

845
01:08:45,102 --> 01:08:47,297
Gotta go. Bank closes at 5:00.

846
01:08:47,404 --> 01:08:50,965
- Come on, Daffy, change him back.
- All right.

847
01:08:51,709 --> 01:08:53,267
Buddy pictures.

848
01:08:56,413 --> 01:08:58,813
- D.J., pal, you're okay.
- Yeah.

849
01:09:00,784 --> 01:09:02,149
Give me that.

850
01:09:02,253 --> 01:09:05,086
- I liked you better as a monkey.
- Thanks.

851
01:09:06,457 --> 01:09:08,288
That is so sweet.

852
01:09:08,459 --> 01:09:11,895
Now if you could just
hand over the diamond.

853
01:09:16,100 --> 01:09:17,567
Immediately!

854
01:09:18,836 --> 01:09:20,133
My turn.

855
01:09:27,645 --> 01:09:29,010
Pardon.

856
01:09:29,847 --> 01:09:33,442
- All right, now, I've come for the diamond.
- I knew it was you.

857
01:09:33,651 --> 01:09:37,109
You knew it was me, did you?
You're wrong. Because I'm not me.

858
01:09:37,187 --> 01:09:38,814
I'm actually...

859
01:09:39,990 --> 01:09:42,254
I can't. I can't reach over the hat.

860
01:09:42,326 --> 01:09:45,318
I'd rehearse back at ACME,
but I never wore the hat.

861
01:09:45,429 --> 01:09:48,330
And now the hat is throwing me off.
Would you...

862
01:09:48,465 --> 01:09:51,434
Thank you very much. Now, I'm actually...

863
01:09:54,204 --> 01:09:55,535
Your father.

864
01:09:56,340 --> 01:09:58,308
- Dad.
- Saw that one coming.

865
01:09:58,375 --> 01:10:00,275
Look into your heart, D.J.

866
01:10:00,711 --> 01:10:04,044
- You know it's true.
- No, it can't be true.

867
01:10:04,381 --> 01:10:06,212
You're right, it isn't.

868
01:10:08,519 --> 01:10:10,214
Let's do some drills.

869
01:10:11,055 --> 01:10:13,216
This doesn't make a lick of sense.

870
01:10:15,125 --> 01:10:17,184
Well, who's laughing now?

871
01:10:18,896 --> 01:10:21,956
Apparently, no one.
Anyway, give me the Monkey!

872
01:10:22,032 --> 01:10:24,193
No, forget that, man. You're evil.

873
01:10:25,569 --> 01:10:27,400
Thank you, but...

874
01:10:27,638 --> 01:10:32,041
Anyway, Mr. Smith,
let's show this muscle-bound beefcake...

875
01:10:32,142 --> 01:10:34,633
who I have sometimes been mistaken for...

876
01:10:34,712 --> 01:10:37,374
what it's like to live in the real world.

877
01:10:40,985 --> 01:10:45,319
Have you ever been disintegrated in one
place and then reassembled in another?

878
01:10:45,389 --> 01:10:46,686
Fire away.

879
01:10:52,529 --> 01:10:54,429
No, you don't!

880
01:11:25,062 --> 01:11:27,292
I thought they fixed that glitch.

881
01:11:29,366 --> 01:11:30,526
Mr. Smith is fired!

882
01:11:30,601 --> 01:11:33,069
I have to do everything myself
around here.

883
01:11:36,573 --> 01:11:38,871
- Good.
- You...

884
01:11:45,916 --> 01:11:47,213
Henchmen.

885
01:11:47,284 --> 01:11:48,410
Dad.

886
01:11:48,719 --> 01:11:50,914
So this is the remote that works.

887
01:11:51,822 --> 01:11:54,950
This, my friend,
is the ACME Train of Death...

888
01:11:55,259 --> 01:11:57,784
which is not good news for your father.

889
01:11:57,928 --> 01:11:59,327
Don't worry about me, son.

890
01:11:59,430 --> 01:12:01,796
I've gotten out of worse scrapes
than this one.

891
01:12:01,899 --> 01:12:04,732
You see, if the Train of Death
doesn't kill him...

892
01:12:04,802 --> 01:12:06,963
then those crates of TNT will.

893
01:12:07,071 --> 01:12:09,904
Not to mention
the 2-ton anvil hanging over his head.

894
01:12:09,973 --> 01:12:12,942
And look. There's the Pendulum of Doom.

895
01:12:13,010 --> 01:12:16,173
What's the Pendulum of Doom
doing there? I did not order it.

896
01:12:16,280 --> 01:12:18,748
It's overkill. Get rid of it.

897
01:12:20,751 --> 01:12:24,278
Now, if you want to
keep your family "together"...

898
01:12:24,988 --> 01:12:27,684
I would hand over the Blue Monkey now.

899
01:12:28,492 --> 01:12:30,756
Don't worry, son. I'm fine.

900
01:12:37,034 --> 01:12:40,470
- You're a sick man, you know that?
- Get used to it.

901
01:12:41,105 --> 01:12:43,437
Excuse me? What about my father?

902
01:12:44,942 --> 01:12:47,877
- He's waiting for a train.
- What? You...

903
01:12:48,645 --> 01:12:50,545
Where's Marvin the Martian?

904
01:12:50,848 --> 01:12:54,875
All right, here is the Blue Monkey.
Go put it on the satellite. Go!

905
01:12:56,453 --> 01:12:58,546
No, you don't, eight ball.

906
01:13:14,505 --> 01:13:17,406
You'd never catch that rabbit
being this heroic.

907
01:13:17,508 --> 01:13:20,739
- What's up, doc?
- You're despicable.

908
01:13:45,869 --> 01:13:47,166
Vandals.

909
01:13:53,010 --> 01:13:55,911
Your friends' efforts will prove to be futile.

910
01:13:56,013 --> 01:13:59,949
You see, here is the Blue Monkey,
here is the ACME satellite.

911
01:14:00,050 --> 01:14:03,781
When the Blue Monkey
is finally docked in the satellite...

912
01:14:05,222 --> 01:14:07,452
I will transmit a beam around the world...

913
01:14:07,558 --> 01:14:11,050
which will transform
everyone but me into monkeys.

914
01:14:11,562 --> 01:14:13,587
Now take them away!

915
01:14:14,131 --> 01:14:15,894
Don't you think that'll get Ionely...

916
01:14:15,966 --> 01:14:20,130
Mr. All My Friends Swing from Trees
and Pick Fleas Out of Their Furry Butts?

917
01:14:20,237 --> 01:14:24,435
Lonely? I suppose I could use
a little human companionship.

918
01:14:24,808 --> 01:14:26,298
Thanks a lot.

919
01:14:26,810 --> 01:14:28,869
I've seen you notice me.

920
01:14:29,413 --> 01:14:30,971
I know I'm hot.

921
01:14:32,149 --> 01:14:35,312
But I prefer someone
with a little more oomph.

922
01:14:35,886 --> 01:14:38,252
I prefer Mary!

923
01:14:42,326 --> 01:14:43,793
Hello, Mary.

924
01:14:43,927 --> 01:14:45,827
We're a cute couple, don't you think?

925
01:14:45,929 --> 01:14:49,729
Take those future simians away
and lower the Monkey shield.

926
01:15:05,682 --> 01:15:08,776
Earthlings have
the worst sense of direction.

927
01:15:11,455 --> 01:15:14,982
What do you know, he fell for it.
I guess I owe you $5.

928
01:15:32,476 --> 01:15:34,467
Did you order satellite?

929
01:15:34,845 --> 01:15:36,608
I don't even have cable.

930
01:15:46,823 --> 01:15:49,485
You know, when I fired that duck...

931
01:15:49,860 --> 01:15:51,885
I never would have seen this coming.

932
01:15:51,995 --> 01:15:53,485
Gotta be a way out of this.

933
01:15:53,563 --> 01:15:57,329
You can get out of this, son.
You've just got to set your mind to it.

934
01:15:57,401 --> 01:16:00,393
Besides, I'm hearing my dad's voice
in my head.

935
01:16:00,570 --> 01:16:03,368
Actually, I'm down here, son.

936
01:16:10,180 --> 01:16:12,580
Hold on, Dad, I'll be right down!

937
01:16:17,688 --> 01:16:19,087
That was too easy.

938
01:16:29,499 --> 01:16:31,228
What was that noise, son?

939
01:16:33,103 --> 01:16:37,039
- You know how I always wanted a dog?
- Yeah?

940
01:16:37,741 --> 01:16:39,003
I just got one.

941
01:16:52,622 --> 01:16:55,216
Wait. Maybe he wants to play fetch.

942
01:16:55,892 --> 01:16:59,953
- Nice mechanical doggy.
- Good dog. Want to play?

943
01:17:00,430 --> 01:17:03,422
Good boy. Fetch!

944
01:17:14,478 --> 01:17:17,447
It looks to be
a deadly mission requiring strength...

945
01:17:17,547 --> 01:17:19,572
cunning and nerves of steel.

946
01:17:19,649 --> 01:17:22,641
So good luck, Bugsy,
I'll keep the engine running.

947
01:17:24,287 --> 01:17:25,777
You tricked me!

948
01:17:26,156 --> 01:17:27,453
What's up, Darth?

949
01:17:27,557 --> 01:17:31,152
Now I must incapacitate you
with my bubble gun.

950
01:17:31,661 --> 01:17:33,060
Ain't that cute?

951
01:17:34,731 --> 01:17:38,132
Of course you realize this means war.

952
01:17:50,647 --> 01:17:53,480
You go that way. I'm gonna go this way.

953
01:18:07,998 --> 01:18:10,091
Bad dog! Sit!

954
01:18:10,367 --> 01:18:12,927
I don't want to put you
under any added pressure...

955
01:18:13,003 --> 01:18:16,495
but judging by the vibrations
of these train tracks, I've got about...

956
01:18:16,606 --> 01:18:18,938
one minute and forty-two seconds left.

957
01:18:19,009 --> 01:18:20,499
Down! Put him down.

958
01:18:30,654 --> 01:18:33,145
What am I gonna do?
What would Damian Drake do?

959
01:18:33,223 --> 01:18:35,054
What would Duck Dodgers do?

960
01:18:35,192 --> 01:18:37,626
Wait a minute. I am Duck Dodgers!

961
01:18:37,794 --> 01:18:40,490
Yes, I'm going to be the hero
of this picture!

962
01:18:40,564 --> 01:18:42,862
Duck Dodgers to the rescue!

963
01:18:53,677 --> 01:18:54,803
Duck...

964
01:18:57,848 --> 01:19:01,807
It's you-know-who to the rescue!
It helps if you don't say the name.

965
01:19:07,891 --> 01:19:09,017
Bad dog!

966
01:20:04,814 --> 01:20:08,716
Disgusting Earth rodent.
Now to neutralize that duck.

967
01:20:15,992 --> 01:20:17,482
This can't be good.

968
01:20:21,831 --> 01:20:26,495
Now the diamond will bathe the Earth
in a monkey-transforming glow.

969
01:20:26,803 --> 01:20:30,432
Ten, nine, eight, seven...

970
01:20:31,007 --> 01:20:33,840
six, five, four...

971
01:20:34,277 --> 01:20:36,802
three, two, one.

972
01:20:38,648 --> 01:20:41,173
Thwarting evil makes me so angry.

973
01:20:46,590 --> 01:20:48,649
That takes care of that.

974
01:21:03,340 --> 01:21:04,830
Thanks, Daff.

975
01:21:07,143 --> 01:21:09,373
Darn dark side!

976
01:21:11,481 --> 01:21:12,971
Are you all monkeys yet?

977
01:21:29,332 --> 01:21:32,790
Checkmate, Mr. Chairman.
You're going down.

978
01:21:35,872 --> 01:21:38,170
Come on, say it.
Just a little "You're my hero"?

979
01:21:38,241 --> 01:21:40,471
- Nope, sorry.
- Bugs, say it, come on.

980
01:21:40,543 --> 01:21:43,205
- Not interested.
- No one will ever know.

981
01:21:46,816 --> 01:21:49,080
I'm really proud of you, D.J.

982
01:21:49,519 --> 01:21:51,646
I knew I could count on you.

983
01:21:52,589 --> 01:21:53,715
Yes.

984
01:21:55,992 --> 01:21:58,222
Dad, I think we should move.

985
01:21:59,729 --> 01:22:03,426
- What was wrong with Beverly Hills?
- I meant from this spot.

986
01:22:21,618 --> 01:22:25,213
- I think we scratched it.
- Don't worry, it's a rental.

987
01:22:25,288 --> 01:22:27,518
You guys, you pulled it off!

988
01:22:27,590 --> 01:22:30,252
- You pulled it off, all right.
- Give me that.

989
01:22:30,360 --> 01:22:31,759
Way to go, Daffy.

990
01:22:31,861 --> 01:22:34,295
You didn't do so bad yourself, stunt boy.

991
01:22:34,397 --> 01:22:35,762
To set the record straight...

992
01:22:35,865 --> 01:22:39,596
all credit for saving the human race
goes to Daffy.

993
01:22:39,703 --> 01:22:40,965
Exactly.

994
01:22:41,071 --> 01:22:43,801
Oh, no, you don't, buster. You're the hero.

995
01:22:45,809 --> 01:22:50,143
Wait a minute. Pronoun trouble.
I'm the hero.

996
01:22:50,246 --> 01:22:51,736
I'm the hero, all right.

997
01:22:52,282 --> 01:22:54,147
Are you gonna introduce us, D.J.?

998
01:22:54,250 --> 01:22:57,413
- Dad, this is Kate. Kate, this is...
- Damian Drake.

999
01:22:57,487 --> 01:23:01,321
I'm a really big fan... of your son.

1000
01:23:02,726 --> 01:23:06,093
Daff, you achieved your goal
of being a hero.

1001
01:23:06,162 --> 01:23:08,653
Yep, but you didn't achieve your goal...

1002
01:23:08,765 --> 01:23:11,290
of getting me back in your stupid movie.

1003
01:23:12,402 --> 01:23:15,337
- Cut. Great, that's a wrap.
- That's it, guys.

1004
01:23:15,438 --> 01:23:17,998
Remind me to get a new agent, will you?

1005
01:23:18,174 --> 01:23:19,436
Thanks.

1006
01:23:20,110 --> 01:23:22,670
Wait a minute. Maybe we are a team.

1007
01:23:22,846 --> 01:23:26,441
Bugs and Daffy. No, Daffy and Bugs.
What do you think?

1008
01:23:31,421 --> 01:23:33,321
Excuse me, do you remember me?

1009
01:23:33,423 --> 01:23:36,620
I threatened your manliness,
and you got me fired?

1010
01:23:36,793 --> 01:23:38,260
I know you.

1011
01:23:38,928 --> 01:23:40,452
Do I know him?

1012
01:23:40,830 --> 01:23:44,857
You must be someone that I got fired.
See, I get a lot of people fired.

1013
01:23:46,269 --> 01:23:48,794
- You be good now.
- So like I said...

1014
01:23:51,608 --> 01:23:54,600
Not again. He's down again. Are you okay?

1015
01:23:54,811 --> 01:23:57,006
- Come on.
- He said he can do stunts.

1016
01:23:57,113 --> 01:23:58,603
Bugs is here. Gotta go.

1017
01:23:58,681 --> 01:24:00,114
Daffy, you're right.

1018
01:24:00,183 --> 01:24:02,378
- The usual place, Mr. Bunny?
- Very good.

1019
01:24:02,485 --> 01:24:06,387
From now on, you and I are going to be
equal partners in this thing.

1020
01:24:06,489 --> 01:24:08,616
No more second banana for you.

1021
01:24:09,058 --> 01:24:11,993
Thanks, pal. I really appreciate this.

1022
01:24:12,061 --> 01:24:14,552
At last my star is rising.

1023
01:24:14,664 --> 01:24:17,064
All my hopes and aspirations...

1024
01:24:21,905 --> 01:24:25,033
What do you know?
My luck is changing already.

1025
01:24:36,419 --> 01:24:38,011
Go home, folks.

1026
