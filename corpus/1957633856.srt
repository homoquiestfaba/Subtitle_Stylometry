The Empress Vel Crowfoot
 sends her regrets for not

368
00:24:51,130 --> 00:24:53,390
being here herself in person.

369
00:24:53,390 --> 00:24:55,540
We ourselves of course
 are so looking forward

370
00:24:55,540 --> 00:24:59,330
to performing a traditional
 mid-20th century lounge

371
00:24:59,330 --> 00:25:02,850
act for you and
 your guests tonight.

372
00:25:02,850 --> 00:25:06,620
How thrilling, an oldie
 worldie lounge act.

373
00:25:06,620 --> 00:25:09,550
It will be a welcome distraction
 from our present state

374
00:25:09,550 --> 00:25:12,140
of scrambled disarray.

375
00:25:12,140 --> 00:25:15,150
Our whole way of
 life is in jeopardy.

376
00:25:15,150 --> 00:25:17,870
We're here to help
 in any way we can.

377
00:25:17,870 --> 00:25:21,520
What exactly is your
 problem, Empress?

378
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:22,460
I don't know.

379
00:25:22,460 --> 00:25:25,010
Everything is going awry.

380
00:25:25,010 --> 00:25:27,280
Where do I begin?

381
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:30,670
This planet is under
 a lot of stress,

382
00:25:30,670 --> 00:25:34,320
tremors, gas fires, nightmares.

383
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:37,530
No one has had a nightmare
 here in decades until now.

384
00:25:37,530 --> 00:25:38,400
And crime?

385
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:40,750
It's skyrocketing.

386
00:25:40,750 --> 00:25:44,190
I myself am a victim
 of a heinous robbery.

387
00:25:44,190 --> 00:25:46,400
My Girlinium gems
 have been stolen.

388
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:48,620
Gems!

389
00:25:48,620 --> 00:25:50,150
All of them?

390
00:25:50,150 --> 00:25:51,190
No.

391
00:25:51,190 --> 00:25:53,610
I still have the most
 important pieces.

392
00:25:53,610 --> 00:25:56,720
But it is imperative that
 we recover the others.

393
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:59,620
What is Gorillium?

394
00:25:59,620 --> 00:26:01,710
That's Girlinium.

395
00:26:01,710 --> 00:26:04,030
Girlinium is a
 very rare crystal,

396
00:26:04,030 --> 00:26:07,360
found only in the caverns of
 the fourth moon of Girlinia.

397
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:09,690
They have great powers.

398
00:26:09,690 --> 00:26:11,480
I use the gems to
 help our planet

399
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:14,810
maintain its delicate
 orbit surrounding our sun.

400
00:26:14,810 --> 00:26:18,450
Since the robbery our orbit
 has begun to deteriorate.

401
00:26:18,450 --> 00:26:21,680
And seismic disturbances
 have increased.

402
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:24,120
Quakes.

403
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:26,140
Only tremors so far.

404
00:26:26,140 --> 00:26:28,790
Vegas residents and all
 my intergalactic guests

405
00:26:28,790 --> 00:26:31,010
believe it's a special
 effect for my annual party

406
00:26:31,010 --> 00:26:32,890
celebration.

407
00:26:32,890 --> 00:26:35,840
Panic must be
 avoided at all costs.

408
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:38,590
No one must know of
 your true mission,

409
00:26:38,590 --> 00:26:40,710
or of this catastrophe.

410
00:26:40,710 --> 00:26:42,700
Did you call the police?

411
00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:45,990
Our Queen of police,
 Veneer, is a prime suspect.

412
00:26:45,990 --> 00:26:48,500
She has been involved
 in many shady dealings

413
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:50,780
throughout the cosmos.

Listen Queen, I
 know all about you.

420
00:27:26,420 --> 00:27:30,330
You stole the Empress's
 jewels, didn't you?

421
00:27:30,330 --> 00:27:31,740
Maybe I did.

422
00:27:31,740 --> 00:27:34,250
And maybe I didn't.

423
00:27:34,250 --> 00:27:36,000
Cool your jets.

424
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:39,160
These showgirls from Earth
 are our royal guests.

425
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:43,700
They will be performing tonight.

426
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:44,770
An animal act.

427
00:27:44,770 --> 00:27:45,570
How amusing.

428
00:27:51,190 --> 00:27:54,270
So you lost some
 jewelry, Empress?

429
00:27:54,270 --> 00:27:55,950
Some Girlinium, I surmise.

430
00:27:55,950 --> 00:27:57,720
Else my dear sister
 wouldn't have

431
00:27:57,720 --> 00:28:00,990
sent these Three Stooges here.

432
00:28:00,990 --> 00:28:04,670
You can't get back those
 gems without my help.

433
00:28:04,670 --> 00:28:08,390
As Queen of Clitorian police
 I have a complete dossier

434
00:28:08,390 --> 00:28:10,870
on everyone on this planet.

435
00:28:10,870 --> 00:28:14,910
Is the thief still on Clitoris?

436
00:28:14,910 --> 00:28:18,530
The thief is still
 here in my very palace,

437
00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:21,460
waiting to steal the remaining
 Girlinium gems tonight,

438
00:28:21,460 --> 00:28:25,500
at my off world slumber party.

439
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:27,000
We'd better act fast.

440
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,620
Under the circumstances,
 I don't have

441
00:28:28,620 --> 00:28:30,630
much choice but to trust you.

442
00:28:30,630 --> 00:28:33,900
I am willing to ignore
 my first impression.

443
00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:35,440
You do impressions?

444
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:37,870
This is no time for levitation.

 HEADSET): So what

452
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,680
did my sister say about me?

453
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:57,130
The same old lies
 about how evil I am?

Look out for that debris.

Oh come on, we'll just
 duck through here.

Chromo-sensitive, aren't they?

No, they change color.

has just escaped from the
 Farmland Cotton Candy Farm.

Try the parachute

475
00:29:59,940 --> 00:30:02,100
Cheap, poor quality, low
 class merchandise will

Have you heard Princess
 Angel's new record?

It's simply cosmic.

It's full of such monster dance
 hits as Hey, Hey Walk This Way

483

and Go-Go With the Flow.

Can you turn it back up?

How's this work?

 the gyro light refractions.

It's very high tech.

You know, some planets out
 here don't even have color yet.

 operational from here.

Well when my sister
 became Empress of Earth,

I decided to go into
 business for myself.

Anyway, to make a
 long story short,

00:35:05,810 --> 00:35:08,650
I built myself this

 Queen of police.

Only crimes of
 fashion, darling.

But a week later, they're picked
 up looking like human garbage.

She's a good girl, Queen!

728
00:42:17,910 --> 00:42:21,420
You never tell me a thing.

729
00:42:21,420 --> 00:42:22,470
I try.

730
00:42:22,470 --> 00:42:24,720
I tell you, I try.

731
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:28,330
But ever since I bought her
 that souped up star cruiser

732
00:42:28,330 --> 00:42:31,420
she's broken every
 law of gravity.

733
00:42:31,420 --> 00:42:36,530
Normally in a case like
 this you'd really get it.

734
00:42:36,530 --> 00:42:39,510
Luckily for you, your mother
 was home when I called.

735
00:42:39,510 --> 00:42:42,690
And so I am remanding
 you to her custody.

736
00:42:42,690 --> 00:42:43,900
No.

737
00:42:43,900 --> 00:42:45,680
Oh anything but that.

738
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:48,100
I'm giving you a
 second chance, Babs.

739
00:42:48,100 --> 00:42:50,310
Don't louse it up.

740
00:42:50,310 --> 00:42:52,890
I'll see that she doesn't.

741
00:42:52,890 --> 00:42:56,310
Things are gonna be
 different around her.

742
00:42:56,310 --> 00:42:57,110
No.

743
00:42:57,110 --> 00:42:59,850
Thank you, Queen.

744
00:42:59,850 --> 00:43:06,700
I don't care what anybody
 says, you're a good woman.

745
00:43:06,700 --> 00:43:13,060
Oh and Babs, if
 you're going to steal,

746
00:43:13,060 --> 00:43:16,330
you really ought
 to steal the best.

747
00:43:16,330 --> 00:43:23,410
This is definitely not the best.

748
00:43:23,410 --> 00:43:28,250
How could you embarrass me like
 this, in front of the police!

749
00:43:28,250 --> 00:43:33,620
Dragging the good name of
 Velour through the gutter.

750
00:43:33,620 --> 00:43:36,000
Ah!

751
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:37,960
Drag.

752
00:43:37,960 --> 00:43:39,770
Thank you dear,
 that will be all.

753
00:43:42,660 --> 00:43:44,890
What a spoiled brat.

754
00:43:44,890 --> 00:43:48,430
Do you think she's part of
 the Girlinium connection?

755
00:43:48,430 --> 00:43:49,230
What?

756
00:43:49,230 --> 00:43:52,400
Do you think she stole
 the Empress's jewels?

757
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:53,860
No, I'm afraid not.

758
00:43:53,860 --> 00:43:57,060
She's too stupid to pull
 off such a grand scam.

759
00:43:57,060 --> 00:43:58,650
Oh, I considered
 the possibility.

760
00:43:58,650 --> 00:44:03,310
But now I'm convinced
 this is an inside job.

761
00:44:03,310 --> 00:44:05,990
Who can it be?

762
00:44:05,990 --> 00:44:07,450
I don't know.

763
00:44:07,450 --> 00:44:08,420
[MUSIC PLAYING]

764
00:44:14,140 --> 00:44:18,370
To tell the truth, I don't
 know why I even bother.

765
00:44:18,370 --> 00:44:20,570
This entire planet
 is falling to pieces

766
00:44:20,570 --> 00:44:22,950
right before my beautiful eyes.

767
00:44:22,950 --> 00:44:24,830
And they don't care.

768
00:44:24,830 --> 00:44:26,510
Nobody sweeps up
 after the quakes.

769
00:44:26,510 --> 00:44:28,340
The clones are running amok.

770
00:44:28,340 --> 00:44:30,470
And the tourists?

771
00:44:30,470 --> 00:44:31,640
They come here on
 vacation and they

772
00:44:31,640 --> 00:44:33,790
act like they own the place.

773
00:44:33,790 --> 00:44:35,490
And Nueva?

774
00:44:35,490 --> 00:44:37,330
She's a child.

775
00:44:37,330 --> 00:44:41,000
A little girl playing
 at being Empress.

776
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:45,210
And Vegas in Space is her toy.

777
00:44:45,210 --> 00:44:47,870
Nobody appreciates
 you, you poor thing.

778
00:44:47,870 --> 00:44:49,890
You need a vacation, honey.

779
00:44:49,890 --> 00:44:51,980
If only that were possible.

780
00:44:51,980 --> 00:44:54,840
But who could take
 over for me here?

781
00:44:54,840 --> 00:44:58,210
Why if I turned my
 back for one second

782
00:44:58,210 --> 00:45:02,120
this entire planet would
 be reduced to atomic dust.

783
00:45:02,120 --> 00:45:04,460
These fools just
 don't understand

784
00:45:04,460 --> 00:45:08,550
that it's our responsibility to
 show the universe the true role

785
00:45:08,550 --> 00:45:10,550
of women in the cosmic order.

786
00:45:10,550 --> 00:45:11,720
You're right.

787
00:45:11,720 --> 00:45:14,290
Why can't they see
 that life isn't just

788
00:45:14,290 --> 00:45:17,710
an endless parade of pretty
 dresses, happy hours,

789
00:45:17,710 --> 00:45:19,540
and slumber parties?

790
00:45:19,540 --> 00:45:21,650
You can't just
 stumble around waiting

791
00:45:21,650 --> 00:45:23,550
for your next glamor booster.

792
00:45:23,550 --> 00:45:25,470
I think your planet is lovely.

793
00:45:25,470 --> 00:45:28,010
And whoever would
 spoil such a good time

00:45:28,010 --> 00:45:30,430

 the Empress's gems

has got to be pretty low.

796
00:45:33,230 --> 00:45:35,880
Why if I ever got
 my hands on her,

797
00:45:35,880 --> 00:45:40,770
I'd, I'd, I'd give
 her a good talking to.

798
00:45:40,770 --> 00:45:42,830
I know how you
 feel, sweetheart.

799
00:45:42,830 --> 00:45:45,060
But you mustn't get
 yourself so worked up.

800
00:45:45,060 --> 00:45:49,100
Well if you're not
 happy, I'm not happy.

801

No, I'm afraid a vacation
 is out of the question

 is wrapped up, and

803

the Girlinium is safely
 hanging around the Empress's

Who are our prime suspects?

806
00:46:01,730 --> 00:46:04,030
It must be someone
 close to the Empress.

807
00:46:04,030 --> 00:46:06,510
Someone above suspicion.

808
00:46:06,510 --> 00:46:09,510
Someone with a mean streak.

809
00:46:09,510 --> 00:46:11,060
Real she-devil.

00:46:11,060 --> 00:46:12,390
No, an angel.

We've got to get
 back to the palace.

If I know her, she'll
 make a play for the rest

of those big rocks tonight.

815
00:46:24,050 --> 00:46:25,530
Stand back, Tracey.

00:46:25,530 --> 00:46:26,560
I'm about to change.

I can't come to your soiree.

 stolen all my drag.

 fingers for the new frog legs.
