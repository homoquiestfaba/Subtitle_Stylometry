- [Priest] Hello, Paula.

47
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:38,445
- [Paula] Father Tyrone?

48
00:04:38,445 --> 00:04:40,030
- [Tyrone] May I come in?

49
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:41,156
- [Paula] Yeah, I guess.

50
00:04:41,156 --> 00:04:43,366
Could I stop you?

51
00:04:43,366 --> 00:04:44,826
- Yeah.

52
00:04:44,826 --> 00:04:46,953
(lively music)

53
00:04:46,953 --> 00:04:49,748
- Did you come to bless
my decaying apartment?

54
00:04:51,374 --> 00:04:52,959
- I could if you'd like.

55
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:55,128
- Well, you can start
with the television set.

56
00:04:55,128 --> 00:04:57,798
I haven't been able to get
Oprah for about a week now.

57
00:05:02,803 --> 00:05:03,970
- Should I just

58
00:05:05,055 --> 00:05:06,932
cut straight to the chase?

59
00:05:07,933 --> 00:05:09,810
- Hm, what could I have done wrong now?

60
00:05:10,936 --> 00:05:15,899
- Your mom is concerned
about your new job, dancing.

61
00:05:16,566 --> 00:05:18,568
- I'm proud of my body, Father.

62
00:05:21,196 --> 00:05:22,364
Let me show you something.

63
00:05:22,364 --> 00:05:24,825
(phone rings)

64
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:29,246
I posed for an artist.

65
00:05:29,246 --> 00:05:30,664
The paint's not even dry yet.

66
00:05:32,541 --> 00:05:35,001
(dog barking)

67
00:05:38,755 --> 00:05:39,548
Do you like it?

68
00:05:40,841 --> 00:05:43,552
- There's a big difference

69
00:05:43,552 --> 00:05:47,097
between posing nude for an artist,

70
00:05:48,348 --> 00:05:50,183
and stripping in a nightclub.

71
00:05:50,183 --> 00:05:53,019
- You're right, the
nightclub pays a lot better.

72
00:05:53,019 --> 00:05:57,983
- Paula, strip joints are
designed to degrade women.

73
00:06:00,861 --> 00:06:02,654
- Men don't come to see me.

74
00:06:02,654 --> 00:06:03,947
They come to see a fantasy.

75
00:06:03,947 --> 00:06:05,532
- Now that's bullshit.

76
00:06:05,532 --> 00:06:07,158
- I wasn't meant to be a nun.

77
00:06:07,158 --> 00:06:08,869
- Neither are most nuns.

78
00:06:08,869 --> 00:06:09,661
- Whatever.

79
00:06:11,121 --> 00:06:13,081
I don't think our bodies are unclean.

80
00:06:13,081 --> 00:06:14,624
I don't think sex is a sin.

81
00:06:14,624 --> 00:06:16,835
It's a lot more rewarding
than being in love.

82
00:06:16,835 --> 00:06:18,253
My mother was in love.

83
00:06:18,253 --> 00:06:21,673
Let some guy screw her, and
nine months later, out I popped.

84
00:06:21,673 --> 00:06:23,174
Her love was long gone.

85
00:06:23,174 --> 00:06:25,218
- Is that what your mother told you?

86
00:06:25,218 --> 00:06:26,720
- Wasn't that the deal?

87
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,263
It must've come up in confession,

88
00:06:28,263 --> 00:06:31,683
or maybe I was the result of a
second immaculate conception?

89
00:06:32,601 --> 00:06:34,895
- Because Paula, if that's the case,

90
00:06:38,231 --> 00:06:40,191
then I think there's
something I should tell you.

91
00:06:40,191 --> 00:06:41,192
- No, don't.

92
00:06:42,193 --> 00:06:44,946
Because I don't like being
lectured to by my mother

93
00:06:44,946 --> 00:06:46,364
who thinks of me as penance,

94
00:06:46,364 --> 00:06:48,074
and I don't have to listen to a man

95
00:06:48,074 --> 00:06:49,367
who's hardly a man at all!

96
00:06:51,244 --> 00:06:53,038
(dog barking)

97
00:06:53,038 --> 00:06:55,498
(Paula sighs)

98
00:06:56,541 --> 00:06:58,209
(baby crying)

99
00:06:58,209 --> 00:06:59,377
I'm sorry, Father.

100
00:07:00,712 --> 00:07:02,297
I know that you're just trying to help,

101
00:07:02,297 --> 00:07:03,965
but I'm gonna be fine, really.

102
00:07:05,592 --> 00:07:08,219
- Goodnight, Paula.

103
00:07:08,219 --> 00:07:09,971
Just think about what I said.

104
00:07:09,971 --> 00:07:10,764
- I will.

105
00:07:12,015 --> 00:07:13,475
Goodnight, Father.

106
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:18,271
(door creaks)

107
00:07:21,566 --> 00:07:24,277
(sirens wailing)

108
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:32,619
(suspenseful music)

109
00:07:32,619 --> 00:07:34,579
- You shouldn't leave your windows open.

110
00:07:35,664 --> 00:07:36,915
(Paula sighs)

111
00:07:36,915 --> 00:07:39,000
- Rob, you scared me.

112
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:43,171
- You seem to forget whose girl you are.

113
00:07:43,171 --> 00:07:45,340
- Relax, the guy's a priest.

114
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:47,509
He's a friend of my
mom's who came over and-

115
00:07:47,509 --> 00:07:52,472
(Rob grunts)
(Paula shrieks)

116
00:07:52,764 --> 00:07:55,558
(engine rumbling)

117
00:07:58,937 --> 00:08:00,814
- That's all right, Paula.

118
00:08:00,814 --> 00:08:02,023
You see?

119
00:08:02,023 --> 00:08:03,692
It doesn't much matter anymore.

120
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:06,569
— You're crazy!

121
00:08:08,154 --> 00:08:13,076
(Rob grunts)
(Paula shrieks)

122
00:08:13,368 --> 00:08:14,744
- I'm finished painting you,

123
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:18,039
and when that happens, well?

124
00:08:21,292 --> 00:08:22,419
It's all over.

125
00:08:23,461 --> 00:08:24,629
- Paula?

126
00:08:24,629 --> 00:08:25,588
Paula!

127
00:08:25,588 --> 00:08:28,049
(eerie music)

128
00:08:32,637 --> 00:08:33,680
Paula, Paula!

129
00:08:38,435 --> 00:08:41,062
(body thudding)

130
00:08:44,524 --> 00:08:45,316
Paula?

131
00:08:54,909 --> 00:08:57,537
(glass tinkles)

132
00:08:58,538 --> 00:09:00,290
Call an ambulance!

133
00:09:00,290 --> 00:09:03,334
(motorcycle revving)

134
00:09:09,424 --> 00:09:11,509
Come on, sweetie.

135
00:09:11,509 --> 00:09:12,302
Please.

136
00:09:13,511 --> 00:09:14,304
Paula?

137
00:09:15,847 --> 00:09:16,639
- Rob.

138
00:09:23,605 --> 00:09:24,606
(police radio crackling)

139
00:09:24,606 --> 00:09:26,983
- [Cop] Any idea who Rob might be?

140
00:09:26,983 --> 00:09:28,902
- [Tyrone] No, I'm sorry I don't.

141
00:09:29,944 --> 00:09:31,237
- [Cop] Tell me, Father.

142
00:09:31,237 --> 00:09:33,948
Why did you come over here this evening?

143
00:09:33,948 --> 00:09:37,994
- [Tyrone] I sometimes
call on parishioners.

144
00:09:37,994 --> 00:09:41,122
- [Cop] Was Paula Brown having
some religious problems?

145
00:09:43,333 --> 00:09:46,419
- [Tyrone] Her mother was
concerned about her job.

146
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:49,339
- At the Black Cat in Hollywood, yeah.

147
00:09:49,339 --> 00:09:51,382
My partner caught her act.

148
00:09:51,382 --> 00:09:52,675
So let me get this straight,

149
00:09:52,675 --> 00:09:54,928
the mother wanted you
to talk to her daughter?

150
00:09:56,262 --> 00:10:01,226
- Paula, and her mother,
communicated across a wide gap.

151
00:10:02,727 --> 00:10:04,562
I tried to bridge that.

152
00:10:04,562 --> 00:10:05,939
(somber music)

153
00:10:05,939 --> 00:10:08,149
- I may as well tell you now, Father.

154
00:10:08,149 --> 00:10:10,151
You're the only person anyone saw enter

155
00:10:10,151 --> 00:10:12,737
or leave the building around
the time of the murder.

156
00:10:14,531 --> 00:10:18,451
- What exactly are you
trying to insinuate?

157
00:10:18,451 --> 00:10:21,204
- That you're a suspect,
and you should know

158
00:10:22,330 --> 00:10:25,416
that collar won't excuse
you from this investigation.

159
00:10:27,168 --> 00:10:29,504
If you think of anything else.

160
00:10:29,504 --> 00:10:30,588
- I'll call.

161
00:10:30,588 --> 00:10:33,133
(somber music)

162
00:10:38,263 --> 00:10:41,391
(motorcycle rumbling)

163
00:10:44,018 --> 00:10:46,980
(crickets chirping)

164
00:10:50,233 --> 00:10:52,777
(door rattles)

165
00:10:57,323 --> 00:10:59,742
(door slams)

166
00:10:59,742 --> 00:11:02,287
(fan whirring)

167
00:11:12,463 --> 00:11:14,924
(eerie music)

168
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:31,065
(haunting choral music)

169
00:11:35,862 --> 00:11:38,573
(fire crackling)

170
00:12:04,933 --> 00:12:07,477
(horror music)

171
00:12:19,364 --> 00:12:22,158
(paint splatting)

172
00:12:26,496 --> 00:12:28,748
A few moments ago I heard someone say

173
00:12:28,748 --> 00:12:32,001
that this was God's will.

174
00:12:32,001 --> 00:12:33,127
I don't accept that.

175
00:12:34,712 --> 00:12:39,300
God's most precious
gift to us is free will.

176
00:12:40,510 --> 00:12:45,473
Someone chose evil when they
took the life of Paula Brown.

177
00:12:47,892 --> 00:12:50,812
So don't blame God for this disaster.

178
00:12:52,021 --> 00:12:56,985
Blame our relentless attraction to evil.

179
00:12:58,736 --> 00:13:00,655
And as for God,

180
00:13:03,324 --> 00:13:06,828
we commend our sister Paula to him,

181
00:13:06,828 --> 00:13:09,622
and ask that he bring her
to the joys of heaven.

182
00:13:11,833 --> 00:13:13,459
And we pray to the Lord

183
00:13:15,086 --> 00:13:19,090
that he may help us in our sorrow, amen.

184
00:13:20,258 --> 00:13:22,385
(organ music)

185
00:13:22,385 --> 00:13:24,929
- [Priest] The chosen must
expect temptations of Satan

186
00:13:24,929 --> 00:13:26,889
almost beyond endurance.

187
00:13:29,058 --> 00:13:30,226
- Lately, Father O'Shea,

188
00:13:30,226 --> 00:13:33,021
I've been wondering what it
actually means to be chosen.

189
00:13:34,397 --> 00:13:38,860
I don't feel like a priest.

190
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:41,863
I feel like something from another time,

191
00:13:41,863 --> 00:13:46,743
like a magician for superstitious people.

192
00:13:46,743 --> 00:13:49,746
- An awful lot of people need your magic.

193
00:13:51,497 --> 00:13:55,877
Daniel, you could go
far in the archdiocese.

194
00:13:55,877 --> 00:13:58,463
The cardinal has his eye on you,

195
00:13:58,463 --> 00:14:01,966
and you're a bloody
poster boy for the church.

196
00:14:01,966 --> 00:14:06,346
The runaway street tough
who becomes a priest.

197
00:14:06,346 --> 00:14:09,849
You come to St. Joseph,
a badly run parish,

198
00:14:10,892 --> 00:14:13,686
and you turn everything around.

199
00:14:15,229 --> 00:14:17,815
- I'm gonna find out
who killer her, Father,

200
00:14:17,815 --> 00:14:19,692
and when I do-

201
00:14:19,692 --> 00:14:22,403
- Yes, just what'll you do?

202
00:14:28,659 --> 00:14:30,495
- That I don't know.

203
00:14:30,495 --> 00:14:33,039
(somber music)

204
00:14:36,584 --> 00:14:37,835
- Were you close to Paula?

205
00:14:39,587 --> 00:14:40,380
- Yeah.

206
00:14:41,506 --> 00:14:42,340
Childhood friend.

207
00:14:43,549 --> 00:14:45,676
I just can't understand it.

208
00:14:45,676 --> 00:14:46,803
Can you?

209
00:14:46,803 --> 00:14:48,513
- No, I can't understand it at all.

210
00:14:49,764 --> 00:14:52,225
Kinda makes you wonder if there's a God.

211
00:14:52,225 --> 00:14:56,020
- Yeah, exactly.

212
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:57,021
- My name's Rob.

213
00:14:58,481 --> 00:14:59,524
- Alicia, hi.

214
00:15:02,151 --> 00:15:03,736
- Are you alone?

215
00:15:03,736 --> 00:15:05,113
- I guess you can't turn

216
00:15:05,113 --> 00:15:07,657
a street tough into a priest after all.

217
00:15:10,284 --> 00:15:12,745
- I'm losing all patience
with you, Father Tyrone.

218
00:15:16,249 --> 00:15:17,875
I wanna tell you something.

219
00:15:18,835 --> 00:15:20,128
The cancer is spreading.

220
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:22,130
I don't have long.

221
00:15:23,756 --> 00:15:26,592
All I care about is the church,

222
00:15:26,592 --> 00:15:29,303
and the quality of its priests.

223
00:15:31,764 --> 00:15:34,934
I can't afford to lose a
priest like you, Daniel.

224
00:15:36,519 --> 00:15:38,229
Find the murderer if you must.

225
00:15:39,439 --> 00:15:43,234
Then, find a way to forgive him.

226
00:15:46,028 --> 00:15:49,157
(motorcycle rumbling)

227
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:57,081
(traffic whooshing)

228
00:15:59,041 --> 00:16:02,086
(motorcycle putting)

229
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:07,133
- Thanks.

230
00:16:09,969 --> 00:16:12,972
You know, I probably
shouldn't be saying this,

231
00:16:12,972 --> 00:16:15,266
but I had a really good time tonight.

232
00:16:15,266 --> 00:16:17,226
I had to get away from all that gloom.

233
00:16:18,436 --> 00:16:21,230
- I think Paula would've
preferred it that way.

234
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:22,023
- Yeah.

235
00:16:24,859 --> 00:16:25,651
Rob?

236
00:16:28,446 --> 00:16:30,239
You never told me how you knew Paula.

237
00:16:32,492 --> 00:16:35,244
- I painted her once.

238
00:16:35,244 --> 00:16:36,787
I didn't know her for very long.

239
00:16:37,872 --> 00:16:39,165
- I see.

240
00:16:39,165 --> 00:16:40,124
- Goodnight, Alicia.

241
00:16:44,378 --> 00:16:45,296
I'll see you again?

242
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:49,342
- Yeah.

243
00:16:49,342 --> 00:16:52,470
(motorcycle rumbling)

244
00:16:56,265 --> 00:16:59,227
(upbeat rock music)

245
00:17:01,479 --> 00:17:05,525

- I'm looking for Nicole?

256
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:56,117
- In the flesh.

257
00:17:59,412 --> 00:18:00,871
- Oh my god.

258
00:18:00,871 --> 00:18:02,832
I hope that rubs off.

259
00:18:02,832 --> 00:18:04,917
- Well, 50 bucks and
I'll let you find out.

260
00:18:06,544 --> 00:18:09,672
- Thanks, but I'd just like to talk.

261
00:18:10,715 --> 00:18:13,634
- Okay, you gotta buy me
a drink first, though.

262
00:18:13,634 --> 00:18:14,427
Come on.

263
00:18:15,886 --> 00:18:17,263
Something sweet, Whitney.

264
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:26,897
So, what's your name, babe?

265
00:18:26,897 --> 00:18:30,735
- Dan, Dan Tyrone.

266
00:18:30,735 --> 00:18:31,527
- Hi, Danny.

267
00:18:34,447 --> 00:18:39,410
- I was told that you knew
Paula Brown fairly well.

268
00:18:41,412 --> 00:18:42,204
- Oh great.

269
00:18:43,497 --> 00:18:44,999
This is gonna bum me out again.

270
00:18:46,167 --> 00:18:48,085
Yeah, we were really close.

271
00:18:48,961 --> 00:18:50,129
So you're a cop.

272
00:18:50,129 --> 00:18:50,963
- No, no.

273
00:18:52,381 --> 00:18:53,841
- [Nicole] What are you, then?

274
00:18:55,092 --> 00:18:57,345
- I was a friend of Paula's.

275
00:18:58,346 --> 00:19:01,307
- You never came up in conversation.

276
00:19:01,307 --> 00:19:03,351
Look, I gotta go get naked, so-

277
00:19:03,351 --> 00:19:04,644
- Nicole, please.

278
00:19:05,811 --> 00:19:07,688
I cared about Paula, too.

279
00:19:08,731 --> 00:19:12,526
I arrived seconds after she was attacked.

280
00:19:12,526 --> 00:19:14,945
She died in my arms.

281
00:19:14,945 --> 00:19:16,113
- Eight bucks, hon?

282
00:19:18,366 --> 00:19:19,992
- Keep it.

283
00:19:19,992 --> 00:19:20,868
- [Dancer] Thanks.

284
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:25,498
- You're that guy in the paper.

285
00:19:25,498 --> 00:19:27,500
You're a fucking priest.

286
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:29,418
I mean, I'm sorry.

287
00:19:29,418 --> 00:19:31,003
Bless me, Father.

288
00:19:31,003 --> 00:19:32,338
- Forget it.

289
00:19:32,338 --> 00:19:36,676
Did Paula ever mention a guy named Rob?

290
00:19:36,676 --> 00:19:37,510
- Yeah, she did.

291
00:19:37,510 --> 00:19:39,178
The cops asked me that too.

292
00:19:39,178 --> 00:19:41,555
It's Robert, actually, her beau.

293
00:19:42,473 --> 00:19:43,391
I never met the guy.

294
00:19:43,391 --> 00:19:45,309
He's kinda mysterious, I guess.

295
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:48,312
Why am I telling you this?

296
00:19:48,312 --> 00:19:49,814
You're a suspect.

297
00:19:49,814 --> 00:19:53,192
- Nicole, I am not a murderer.

298
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:54,819
- So I'm supposed to
believe you're innocent

299
00:19:54,819 --> 00:19:57,029
just because you wear
your collar backwards?

300
00:19:57,029 --> 00:19:57,947
- That's up to you.

301
00:19:59,323 --> 00:20:04,286
But I need to know what you
know about this guy, Robert.

302
00:20:07,206 --> 00:20:09,458
- I think she said he
came from the Midwest,

303
00:20:10,418 --> 00:20:14,463
but that he lived in Bakersfield
before he moved down here.

304
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:15,840
- Bakersfield?

305
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:17,842
- Yeah, he's an artist.

306
00:20:17,842 --> 00:20:19,844
Very sensitive, you know.

307
00:20:19,844 --> 00:20:21,971
- Did she mention his last name?

308
00:20:23,222 --> 00:20:24,014
- Sorry.

309
00:20:26,934 --> 00:20:28,728
You think he did it, don't you?

310
00:20:28,728 --> 00:20:30,938
- I sure would like to talk to him.

311
00:20:32,398 --> 00:20:33,983
- [Server] You're up in two, girl.

312
00:20:36,861 --> 00:20:38,946
- [Nicole] Hey, now you
gotta do something for me.

313
00:20:38,946 --> 00:20:39,780
- [Daniel] What?

314
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:41,157
- Watch my act.

315
00:20:41,157 --> 00:20:43,284
You know, stripping is
a lot like preaching.

316
00:20:43,284 --> 00:20:45,786
It's all about keeping
an audience inspired,

317
00:20:45,786 --> 00:20:47,413
and off the streets.

318
00:20:52,752 --> 00:20:55,546
(people cheering)

319
00:20:59,508 --> 00:21:00,426
(disc whirring)

320
00:21:00,426 --> 00:21:02,928
(upbeat music)

321
00:21:05,097 --> 00:21:07,850
(people cheering)

322
00:21:24,116 --> 00:21:28,412
(woman singing in foreign language)

323
00:21:59,527 --> 00:22:01,487
- [Daniel] Paula, Paula!

324
00:22:06,575 --> 00:22:09,286
(Daniel panting)

325
00:22:18,045 --> 00:22:20,422
(door slams)

326
00:22:21,882 --> 00:22:26,178
(woman singing in foreign language)

327
00:23:04,383 --> 00:23:06,427
- Here's the key to Paula's apartment.

328
00:23:07,428 --> 00:23:08,470
What's going on, Dan?

329
00:23:08,470 --> 00:23:10,222
I've seen that look.

330
00:23:10,222 --> 00:23:14,101
- Some things demand a bit more energy.

331
00:23:14,101 --> 00:23:15,895
- [Elizabeth] I just don't
want you to lose control.

332
00:23:15,895 --> 00:23:17,187
- [Daniel] I'm not going to.

333
00:23:17,187 --> 00:23:18,981
- I know what you're capable of, Dan.

334
00:23:18,981 --> 00:23:21,108
You put my brother in the hospital.

335
00:23:21,108 --> 00:23:22,568
- Damn it, Elizabeth!

336
00:23:23,861 --> 00:23:26,280
My daughter was killed.

337
00:23:28,157 --> 00:23:30,743
I was right there,

338
00:23:30,743 --> 00:23:35,205
and she died thinking that
her father had abandoned her.

339
00:23:35,205 --> 00:23:36,665
- No.

340
00:23:36,665 --> 00:23:38,292
You never had a daughter.

341
00:23:39,710 --> 00:23:44,256
You were a priest, who forgot
his vows for one night.

342
00:23:44,256 --> 00:23:45,549
I raised her.

343
00:23:45,549 --> 00:23:49,845
- You know that I did
everything for her that I could.

344
00:23:49,845 --> 00:23:51,138
- Well, it wasn't enough.

345
00:23:51,138 --> 00:23:54,350
- Okay, okay, it was not enough.

346
00:23:54,350 --> 00:23:56,894
And maybe that's why I feel responsible.

347
00:23:59,688 --> 00:24:01,482
I wanted to be a father.

348
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:04,818
Why didn't you marry me?

349
00:24:09,573 --> 00:24:10,616
- I was afraid.

350
00:24:12,117 --> 00:24:14,453
- Of what?

351
00:24:14,453 --> 00:24:16,163
- [Elizabeth] Of you.

352
00:24:17,539 --> 00:24:20,042
(engine rumbling)

353
00:24:20,042 --> 00:24:23,003
(suspenseful music)

354
00:24:28,133 --> 00:24:30,594
(trunk thuds)

355
00:24:42,731 --> 00:24:45,192
(lock creaks)

356
00:25:12,469 --> 00:25:15,097
(phone dialing)

357
00:25:16,849 --> 00:25:18,183
- [Operator] What city, please?

358
00:25:18,183 --> 00:25:22,312
- Yeah, Los Angeles for Robert Sorrel

359
00:25:22,312 --> 00:25:24,690
spelled S-O-R-R-E-L.

360
00:25:26,025 --> 00:25:28,527
- [Operator] I have no
listing under that name.

361
00:25:28,527 --> 00:25:30,404
- Do you have anything on the east side?

362
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:33,032
- [Operator] No sir, I'm sorry.

363
00:25:33,032 --> 00:25:35,743
(dramatic music)

364
00:25:40,456 --> 00:25:43,542
(motorcycle rumbling)

365
00:25:53,677 --> 00:25:56,638
(crickets chirping)

366
00:25:58,932 --> 00:26:00,726
- Mm, Robbie.

367
00:26:00,726 --> 00:26:02,644
What's going on, why are we meeting here?

368
00:26:02,644 --> 00:26:04,313
- Where's my painting, Amanda?

369
00:26:05,272 --> 00:26:07,441
- Your painting, of me?

370
00:26:09,234 --> 00:26:10,652
I gave that to your mother weeks ago,

371
00:26:10,652 --> 00:26:11,862
just like you told me to.

372
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:16,200
- Has the paint dried yet?

373
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:18,952
(tense music)

374
00:26:18,952 --> 00:26:20,537
- Rob, what's wrong with you?

375
00:26:20,537 --> 00:26:22,790
(Rob grunting)

376
00:26:22,790 --> 00:26:24,208
Of course the paint's dried.

377
00:26:25,084 --> 00:26:26,502
(Amanda gagging)

378
00:26:26,502 --> 00:26:28,629
- I guess we should hang it up, then.

379
00:26:28,629 --> 00:26:31,173
(horror music)

380
00:26:41,058 --> 00:26:44,186
(motorcycle rumbling)

381
00:27:05,916 --> 00:27:07,709
- [Alicia] Wow, these are great.

382
00:27:08,585 --> 00:27:10,921
- You think I have half a chance?

383
00:27:10,921 --> 00:27:12,673
- God, yes.

384
00:27:12,673 --> 00:27:13,590
So real.

385
00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:14,883
- Thanks.

386
00:27:14,883 --> 00:27:16,927
I seem to see reality pretty clearly.

387
00:27:18,011 --> 00:27:19,596
- Do you sell them?

388
00:27:19,596 --> 00:27:21,932
- Unfortunately, I might have to.

389
00:27:21,932 --> 00:27:24,726
I'd hate to break up the series, though.

390
00:27:24,726 --> 00:27:27,104
- Series, what's it called?

391
00:27:27,104 --> 00:27:27,896
- I don't know.

392
00:27:32,985 --> 00:27:37,739
Maybe I'll call it "Women:
You Can't Live with Them."

393
00:27:41,451 --> 00:27:42,244
Just kidding.

394
00:27:46,039 --> 00:27:48,167
- Would you ever consider painting me?

395
00:27:48,167 --> 00:27:49,918
- That wouldn't be such a good idea.

396
00:27:51,670 --> 00:27:53,714
I can only paint the dark side of people,

397
00:27:53,714 --> 00:27:56,341
and you don't seem to have one.

398
00:27:58,135 --> 00:27:59,553
- You make me sound so boring.

399
00:28:02,055 --> 00:28:04,474
Wait a minute, you painted Paula.

400
00:28:07,102 --> 00:28:07,895
- Yeah.

401
00:28:09,229 --> 00:28:10,981
I must've seen something in her.

402
00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:14,902
The tragedy she was headed for.

403
00:28:14,902 --> 00:28:15,694
- Yeah.

404
00:28:17,654 --> 00:28:19,531
Well, think about it.

405
00:28:19,531 --> 00:28:22,242
I bet you don't get such offers every day.

406
00:28:22,242 --> 00:28:23,035
- No.

407
00:28:25,787 --> 00:28:26,580
Not every day.

408
00:28:29,374 --> 00:28:30,292
- [Cop] Well, I'm here to talk to you

409
00:28:30,292 --> 00:28:33,128
about your visit with the stripper.

410
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:39,843
(Daniel panting)

411
00:28:39,843 --> 00:28:42,304
- Her name is Nicole Taylor.

412
00:28:43,180 --> 00:28:45,474
- She mentioned you two had a talk.

413
00:28:45,474 --> 00:28:47,559
Anything you care to share?

414
00:28:47,559 --> 00:28:50,354
- [Daniel] You know as
much as I do, Lieutenant.

415
00:28:50,354 --> 00:28:53,941
- Actually, I know a little bit more.

416
00:28:55,108 --> 00:28:58,070
I got the lab report back
on the murder weapon.

417
00:28:58,070 --> 00:28:59,238
- Any prints?

418
00:28:59,238 --> 00:29:01,365
- Yes, yours.

419
00:29:05,869 --> 00:29:07,788
- I'm not a killer, Lieutenant.

420
00:29:07,788 --> 00:29:10,249
- Maybe not, but you have gotten into

421
00:29:10,249 --> 00:29:11,291
your share of trouble.

422
00:29:12,251 --> 00:29:15,045
Two counts of assault
on your record, Father.

423
00:29:15,045 --> 00:29:16,880
Some drug use.

424
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:18,882
Shocked even me when I read the report.

425
00:29:21,260 --> 00:29:22,928
- I was a restless young man once.

426
00:29:24,388 --> 00:29:28,225
Don't tell me I'm your
only suspect, Lieutenant.

427
00:29:28,225 --> 00:29:29,810
- Somebody broke into the apartment

428
00:29:29,810 --> 00:29:31,770
of the deceased last night.

429
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:33,939
Any idea who might've done that?

430
00:29:33,939 --> 00:29:35,482
- Sorry, I can't help you there.

431
00:29:38,568 --> 00:29:41,029
(door creaks)

432
00:29:42,739 --> 00:29:44,825
- Pistol packing priest?

433
00:29:44,825 --> 00:29:47,703
- The fastest gun in the pulpit.

434
00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:55,043
- Let me ask you, Father.

435
00:29:55,043 --> 00:29:57,254
Why are you interested in police work?

436
00:29:57,254 --> 00:29:59,673
I thought saving souls was your priority.

437
00:30:00,924 --> 00:30:03,552
- I'm personally involved
in this, Lieutenant.

438
00:30:05,721 --> 00:30:07,264
- [Rob] It's summer, it's your off season.

439
00:30:07,264 --> 00:30:08,932
What do you expect to lose?

440
00:30:08,932 --> 00:30:12,853
- Look, Rob, your new
approach is very interesting,

441
00:30:12,853 --> 00:30:15,355
but you know what?

442
00:30:15,355 --> 00:30:17,399
I'm not crazy about it.

443
00:30:17,399 --> 00:30:19,609
You see, that's the problem.

444
00:30:19,609 --> 00:30:21,695
- That's because you don't like women.

445
00:30:21,695 --> 00:30:24,364
- I don't like the way you depict them.

446
00:30:24,364 --> 00:30:26,450
Your work makes the viewer feel,

447
00:30:26,450 --> 00:30:30,537
for the lack of a better word, uneasy.

448
00:30:30,537 --> 00:30:32,414
- That's the point.

449
00:30:32,414 --> 00:30:33,957
You see, I've managed to capture

450
00:30:33,957 --> 00:30:37,127
a little passion and pain here,
or can't you fucking get it?

451
00:30:37,127 --> 00:30:39,880
- Well, I'm afraid passion
and pain doesn't mesh well

452
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:42,382
with the walls of corporate
executive offices.

453
00:30:42,382 --> 00:30:45,052
- Listen, you little, look.

454
00:30:46,636 --> 00:30:49,890
Just take a chance on a
couple of canvases, okay?

455
00:30:49,890 --> 00:30:51,099
- Sorry, Rob.

456
00:30:51,099 --> 00:30:52,726
Can't do it.

457
00:30:52,726 --> 00:30:55,270
Go back to painting cityscapes.

458
00:30:55,270 --> 00:30:57,647
The naked body is out of vogue.

459
00:30:59,149 --> 00:31:02,569
(gentle orchestral music)

460
00:31:24,216 --> 00:31:27,260
(paint can clatters)

461
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:29,971
(easel clatters)

462
00:31:35,811 --> 00:31:38,939
(motorcycle rumbling)

463
00:31:41,274 --> 00:31:43,652
(horn honks)

464
00:31:44,903 --> 00:31:47,447
- Hey, sweetie.

465
00:31:47,447 --> 00:31:49,449
When you gonna ask me back
to finish the painting?

466
00:31:49,449 --> 00:31:50,325
- I finished it without you.

467
00:31:50,325 --> 00:31:52,160
Where the hell have you been?

468
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:53,954
- Relax, I just posed for you.

469
00:31:56,498 --> 00:31:57,332
You got 30?

470
00:32:02,170 --> 00:32:03,630
You know, if you would just relax

471
00:32:03,630 --> 00:32:05,841
you would be a much nicer person.

472
00:32:10,178 --> 00:32:11,596
(static crackling)

473
00:32:11,596 --> 00:32:13,557
Why don't you get yourself comfortable?

474
00:32:13,557 --> 00:32:15,267
- I am comfortable.

475
00:32:15,267 --> 00:32:18,145
(static crackling)

476
00:32:19,604 --> 00:32:22,441
- [Televangelist] Usurpers of God.

477
00:32:22,441 --> 00:32:24,901
In every way, and every place.

478
00:32:28,738 --> 00:32:31,450
What God cast out in
the glory of his life,

479
00:32:31,450 --> 00:32:34,161
banished forever to the darkness.

480
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:41,585
(both moaning)

481
00:32:47,424 --> 00:32:49,885
(Rob panting)

482
00:32:54,473 --> 00:32:57,100
His only son, Jesus of Nazareth,

483
00:32:58,518 --> 00:33:01,605
to the glory and the light of thine blood,

484
00:33:01,605 --> 00:33:04,983
that one day we may rise
up to the throne of heaven,

485
00:33:04,983 --> 00:33:08,695
and sit in the midst of
the angels by his side.

486
00:33:08,695 --> 00:33:10,030
Thank you, Jesus.

487
00:33:14,951 --> 00:33:16,161
(man knocking)

488
00:33:16,161 --> 00:33:19,664
- [Man] Hey, hurry your ass up in there.

489
00:33:19,664 --> 00:33:21,166
I got other customers waiting.

490
00:33:22,667 --> 00:33:24,294
- [Televangelist] For
the glory of the Father,

491
00:33:24,294 --> 00:33:26,755
and strive for the glory of Jesus,

492
00:33:26,755 --> 00:33:28,924
hold nothing for those.

493
00:33:28,924 --> 00:33:29,799
Thank you.

494
00:33:29,799 --> 00:33:32,594
(Daniel grunting)

495
00:33:45,774 --> 00:33:48,401
(bag squeaking)

496
00:33:51,613 --> 00:33:54,199
(phone dialing)

497
00:34:03,416 --> 00:34:05,835
(phone rings)

498
00:34:07,671 --> 00:34:11,091
- Yeah, listing in Bakersfield.

499
00:34:12,676 --> 00:34:14,511
- Wow, you certainly picked

500
00:34:14,511 --> 00:34:16,263
the most desolate spot in the city.

501
00:34:17,180 --> 00:34:19,808
I guess I'll have to trust
you to act like a gentleman.

502
00:34:21,768 --> 00:34:22,561
What is it?

503
00:34:23,562 --> 00:34:24,354
- It's you.

504
00:34:25,772 --> 00:34:28,567
There are moments when
the light hits your face,

505
00:34:29,859 --> 00:34:31,361
you're so striking.

506
00:34:35,323 --> 00:34:38,702
- Rob, I like you.

507
00:34:39,911 --> 00:34:43,039
A lot.

508
00:34:43,039 --> 00:34:44,416
But the way I was raised,

509
00:34:47,210 --> 00:34:49,754
I'm supposed to be waiting
until I get married.

510
00:34:50,964 --> 00:34:54,217
This is gonna sound a
little old fashioned,

511
00:34:54,217 --> 00:34:55,844
but I like the idea.

512
00:34:58,638 --> 00:35:00,515
Does that sound stupid?

513
00:35:01,891 --> 00:35:02,684
- Not at all.

514
00:35:05,645 --> 00:35:08,273
(ominous music)

515
00:35:15,071 --> 00:35:17,699
(rooster crows)

516
00:35:21,369 --> 00:35:22,996
- I'm sorry you had to drag yourself

517
00:35:22,996 --> 00:35:24,956
all the way down here, Father.

518
00:35:24,956 --> 00:35:27,834
You must be very busy, what
with all the sin in the world.

519
00:35:29,044 --> 00:35:32,631
But, I don't know where my son lives.

520
00:35:32,631 --> 00:35:35,133
- I'm interested in anything
that you can tell me

521
00:35:35,133 --> 00:35:36,760
about your son, Mrs. Sorrel.

522
00:35:38,053 --> 00:35:38,845
- My son.

523
00:35:41,097 --> 00:35:42,098
Well, he's no saint.

524
00:35:42,974 --> 00:35:44,476
I can tell ya that.

525
00:35:44,476 --> 00:35:46,811
- When did you last see him?

526
00:35:46,811 --> 00:35:49,147
- Couple weeks ago, he dropped by.

527
00:35:49,147 --> 00:35:51,483
He was undergoing one of his crises.

528
00:35:53,652 --> 00:35:56,404
My son is very good at
going through crises.

529
00:35:57,989 --> 00:36:00,450
He was gonna be a priest once.

530
00:36:00,450 --> 00:36:02,077
I should've had him do that,

531
00:36:02,077 --> 00:36:04,412
because then he would've
had his fill of crises.

532
00:36:05,789 --> 00:36:07,207
- I suppose he would have.

533
00:36:07,207 --> 00:36:08,708
- Other people's crises.

534
00:36:11,503 --> 00:36:14,881
Of course, he doesn't wanna
talk to the likes of me.

535
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:17,592
He's an artist, you see.

536
00:36:19,219 --> 00:36:24,182
Which means, he paints dirty pictures.

537
00:36:25,809 --> 00:36:28,228
Now, you understand, Father,

538
00:36:28,228 --> 00:36:33,191
I ordinarily do not let this
kind of material into my home.

539
00:36:34,609 --> 00:36:35,944
- I understand.

540
00:36:35,944 --> 00:36:37,112
When was this done?

541
00:36:38,697 --> 00:36:41,074
- Well, not too long ago
I'm sorry to tell ya.

542
00:36:41,991 --> 00:36:44,411
- Do you know where I
would find the model?

543
00:36:44,411 --> 00:36:46,496
- You'd have to look in the county morgue.

544
00:36:48,039 --> 00:36:49,582
It was in the morning papers.

545
00:36:49,582 --> 00:36:50,583
- [Daniel] Excuse me?

546
00:36:51,459 --> 00:36:53,461
- She was murdered last night.

547
00:36:54,421 --> 00:36:56,339
The police figured a stranger

548
00:36:56,339 --> 00:36:58,133
must have picked her up on Highway 99.

549
00:36:58,133 --> 00:36:59,384
There it is.

550
00:36:59,384 --> 00:37:00,885
Amanda Peterson.

551
00:37:03,054 --> 00:37:04,514
Amanda.

552
00:37:04,514 --> 00:37:07,517
She always was getting into trouble.

553
00:37:07,517 --> 00:37:10,103
In fact, it's just like her to go out

554
00:37:10,103 --> 00:37:11,730
and get herself strangled.

555
00:37:14,566 --> 00:37:17,193
She's sure got sad eyes,
don't you think, Father?

556
00:37:18,653 --> 00:37:20,071
- Can I borrow this painting?

557
00:37:21,197 --> 00:37:25,410
- It's all I have of
Rob's, filthy though it is.

558
00:37:25,410 --> 00:37:27,912
- [Daniel] It's very important.

559
00:37:29,956 --> 00:37:31,958
- Okay, take it.

560
00:37:33,042 --> 00:37:37,922
So, why are you asking me all
these questions about Rob?

561
00:37:40,717 --> 00:37:43,970
- Mrs. Sorrel, your son
may be in some trouble.

562
00:37:43,970 --> 00:37:45,722
I won't know until I find him.

563
00:37:47,098 --> 00:37:50,101
- Well, I'm not surprised to hear that.

564
00:37:52,353 --> 00:37:53,188
- You wouldn't happen

565
00:37:53,188 --> 00:37:55,273
to have a photograph of him, would you?

566
00:37:55,273 --> 00:38:00,195
- All I have is old ones.

567
00:38:00,195 --> 00:38:00,987
- That's fine.

568
00:38:01,988 --> 00:38:05,950
♪ His craft and power are great ♪

569
00:38:07,494 --> 00:38:09,788
- I never should've let
him out of this house.

570
00:38:14,292 --> 00:38:19,172
But, you gotta let a
boy go out in the world.

571
00:38:21,674 --> 00:38:24,385
Make his mark, don't you think?

572
00:38:26,179 --> 00:38:27,222
- YES.

573
00:38:27,222 --> 00:38:29,307
I suppose that's true.

574
00:38:29,307 --> 00:38:32,268
(nail gun thudding)

575
00:38:38,775 --> 00:38:41,861
(bell ringing)

576
00:38:41,861 --> 00:38:44,489
(steam hissing)

577
00:38:47,325 --> 00:38:50,662
(door rattles)

578
00:38:50,662 --> 00:38:52,580
- I decided I want to pose for you,

579
00:38:52,580 --> 00:38:55,041
and I won't take no for an answer.

580
00:38:56,417 --> 00:38:59,212
- I told you that's not such a good idea.

581
00:38:59,212 --> 00:39:01,923
- Well, maybe you need
a change in subject.

582
00:39:01,923 --> 00:39:04,467
(fan whirring)

583
00:39:06,761 --> 00:39:08,221
(door rattles)

584
00:39:08,221 --> 00:39:11,182
(eerie synth music)

585
00:39:24,529 --> 00:39:28,825
(woman singing in foreign language)

586
00:40:17,957 --> 00:40:20,501
(men shouting)

587
00:40:33,014 --> 00:40:34,015
- Hey, sailor.

588
00:40:35,016 --> 00:40:36,267
Love that uniform.

589
00:40:38,645 --> 00:40:40,271
- Have you ever seen this guy?

590
00:40:43,524 --> 00:40:44,317
- Is he the one?

591
00:40:45,318 --> 00:40:47,362
- I don't know, I think so.

592
00:40:47,362 --> 00:40:48,947
<i>- HEY-</i>

593
00:40:48,947 --> 00:40:50,990
Save us some, padre.

594
00:40:50,990 --> 00:40:53,785
(people laughing)

595
00:40:53,785 --> 00:40:55,370
- Meet me in back.

596
00:40:55,370 --> 00:40:57,747
(rock music)

597
00:41:02,377 --> 00:41:05,171
- [Alicia] You know,
you should do a painting

598
00:41:05,171 --> 00:41:07,548
entitled "Scene from a Loft."

599
00:41:09,092 --> 00:41:10,385
- I Paint people.

600
00:41:11,803 --> 00:41:14,055
I capture their souls with color.

601
00:41:14,055 --> 00:41:15,932
That's what the series is all about.

602
00:41:18,893 --> 00:41:20,645
- What color is my soul?

603
00:41:20,645 --> 00:41:23,189
(fan whirring)

604
00:41:26,025 --> 00:41:26,818
- Blue.

605
00:41:28,820 --> 00:41:30,405
- Blue?

606
00:41:30,405 --> 00:41:31,197
- I think.

607
00:41:32,532 --> 00:41:35,410
Best guess I can make without
cutting you open to find out.

608
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:40,456
- How do you want me to pose?

609
00:41:42,792 --> 00:41:44,002
- [Rob] Sit in the chair.

610
00:41:45,670 --> 00:41:47,463
- I don't have to be naked?

611
00:41:47,463 --> 00:41:50,091
- I'm not going to paint you
like I painted the others.

612
00:41:51,300 --> 00:41:54,429
This is simply a gift,
for your mom and dad.

613
00:41:56,097 --> 00:41:57,015
- How's this?

614
00:41:58,725 --> 00:41:59,934
- That's not what I want.

615
00:42:05,565 --> 00:42:06,524
Turn into the light.

616
00:42:11,112 --> 00:42:11,904
There.

617
00:42:13,281 --> 00:42:16,159
(women chattering)

618
00:42:18,911 --> 00:42:19,704
- Ladies?

619
00:42:21,039 --> 00:42:22,623
Please, excuse me?

620
00:42:25,043 --> 00:42:27,253
- Hey, girls, check this out.

621
00:42:27,253 --> 00:42:28,463
Any of you seen this guy?

622
00:42:29,422 --> 00:42:30,923
- [Woman] No.

623
00:42:30,923 --> 00:42:33,301
- No.
- Doesn't look familiar.

624
00:42:35,470 --> 00:42:37,638
- I know that bastard.

625
00:42:37,638 --> 00:42:40,141
He wanted me to pose nude for him once.

626
00:42:40,141 --> 00:42:41,934
A real religious psycho.

627
00:42:43,144 --> 00:42:44,562
No offense, Father.

628
00:42:44,562 --> 00:42:45,354
- None taken.

629
00:42:46,272 --> 00:42:47,273
When was this?

630
00:42:47,273 --> 00:42:48,566
- About a year ago.

631
00:42:49,776 --> 00:42:53,988
He lived down on the Boulevard,
up above a porn bookstore.

632
00:42:53,988 --> 00:42:57,909
Think it was called Little Shop of Whores.

633
00:42:59,035 --> 00:43:00,870
- Did he ever complete the painting?

634
00:43:02,163 --> 00:43:04,290
- I never let him start.

635
00:43:04,290 --> 00:43:06,751
He was on some kind of really weird trip.

636
00:43:08,002 --> 00:43:09,337
You know, in this business,

637
00:43:10,338 --> 00:43:12,673
you get a real quick sense
about guys like that.

638
00:43:17,804 --> 00:43:19,013
- Relax.

639
00:43:19,013 --> 00:43:21,140
- God, let me see it.
- No.

640
00:43:22,100 --> 00:43:23,518
- Mm, touchy.

641
00:43:24,519 --> 00:43:25,520
When do I get to see it?

642
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:26,646
- When it's finished.

643
00:43:34,779 --> 00:43:37,323
(somber music)

644
00:43:41,077 --> 00:43:42,995
Tomorrow, same time?

645
00:43:44,497 --> 00:43:46,582
- Yeah.

646
00:43:46,582 --> 00:43:49,293
But I'm gonna start charging you.

647
00:43:53,172 --> 00:43:55,216
- [Daniel] Appreciate your help.

648
00:43:55,216 --> 00:43:56,092
- No problem.

649
00:43:57,260 --> 00:43:59,679
You're determined to get
this guy, aren't you?

650
00:43:59,679 --> 00:44:00,471
- YES.

651
00:44:01,931 --> 00:44:03,057
- I know his kind.

652
00:44:04,350 --> 00:44:06,936
He's obsessed by the naked female body.

653
00:44:07,812 --> 00:44:08,771
- Most men are.

654
00:44:09,856 --> 00:44:14,068
- Yeah, but his is a
kind of hatred, you know?

655
00:44:16,070 --> 00:44:18,489
And everybody knows what
a slut deserves, right?

656
00:44:25,037 --> 00:44:27,248
- Maybe you should find
another line of work.

657
00:44:28,124 --> 00:44:29,500
- What, move in with you?

658
00:44:31,419 --> 00:44:33,754
- I don't think the church
is quite ready for that.

659
00:44:33,754 --> 00:44:36,382
(Nicole laughs)

660
00:44:37,508 --> 00:44:38,801
- This is the place.

661
00:44:40,678 --> 00:44:43,055
(funk music)

662
00:44:57,570 --> 00:44:59,071
- Little divine intervention.

663
00:45:00,323 --> 00:45:01,240
Yeah?
- Yep.

664
00:45:06,245 --> 00:45:10,958
- I'm looking for a lost soul, son.

665
00:45:10,958 --> 00:45:12,460
You seen this man?

666
00:45:12,460 --> 00:45:14,003
- Why do you do this?

667
00:45:14,003 --> 00:45:15,630
Customers no like priest in here.

668
00:45:17,590 --> 00:45:20,259
- You tell me about Rob
Sorrel, and I'm outta here.

669
00:45:20,259 --> 00:45:22,178
- I know nothing, please leave.

670
00:45:23,554 --> 00:45:25,139
- Are you sure?

671
00:45:25,139 --> 00:45:30,102
You don't have any religious
periodicals, guns and ammo?

672
00:45:30,269 --> 00:45:32,772
- Father, Father, Father.

673
00:45:32,772 --> 00:45:34,315
He lived in the lofts upstairs.

674
00:45:34,315 --> 00:45:37,318
Deadbeat, no pay rent, gone for weeks.

675
00:45:37,318 --> 00:45:38,527
- Did he leave a forwarding address?

676
00:45:38,527 --> 00:45:40,738
- Nothing, he no leave last month's rent.

677
00:45:41,656 --> 00:45:42,907
Instead, he give me that.

678
00:45:45,243 --> 00:45:47,954
- How much you want for it?

679
00:45:47,954 --> 00:45:49,247
- How much are you paying?

680
00:45:52,124 --> 00:45:53,542
<i>'</i> $30.

681
00:45:53,542 --> 00:45:55,586
- Rent he owe is 300.

682
00:45:55,586 --> 00:45:56,796
- 50, no more.

683
00:45:58,839 --> 00:46:00,383
- If you leave now, huh?

684
00:46:07,807 --> 00:46:08,933
- I leave now.

685
00:46:10,017 --> 00:46:12,561
(somber music)

686
00:46:15,523 --> 00:46:17,692
(camera clicking)

687
00:46:17,692 --> 00:46:20,069
(man knocks)

688
00:46:22,822 --> 00:46:23,656
(phone rings)

689
00:46:23,656 --> 00:46:26,158
- Rainy, we've got ourselves

690
00:46:26,158 --> 00:46:28,995
some kind of weird priest on our hands.

691
00:46:28,995 --> 00:46:33,749
Strip clubs, porn stores, carries a piece,

692
00:46:33,749 --> 00:46:35,418
and hangs out with strippers.

693
00:46:36,794 --> 00:46:37,878
What you got?

694
00:46:37,878 --> 00:46:39,505
- Call came in from Kern County.

695
00:46:39,505 --> 00:46:41,048
Guess what?

696
00:46:41,048 --> 00:46:41,841
- It ain't good.

697
00:46:47,263 --> 00:46:50,057
(brushes clatter)

698
00:46:55,730 --> 00:46:57,606
- This has never happened to me before.

699
00:46:58,649 --> 00:47:02,236
- I guess I'm a difficult
subject, aren't I?

700
00:47:03,529 --> 00:47:04,697
I have an idea.

701
00:47:04,697 --> 00:47:05,489
- What?

702
00:47:06,949 --> 00:47:09,493
- All your other paintings
of women have been nudes.

703
00:47:10,578 --> 00:47:12,913
- Those paintings are about corruption.

704
00:47:13,873 --> 00:47:15,458
- Is the human body corrupt?

705
00:47:16,334 --> 00:47:18,377
- The jury's still out on that.

706
00:47:18,377 --> 00:47:20,004
- Then let me pose nude for you, Rob.

707
00:47:20,004 --> 00:47:21,922
I'll show you you can even paint purity.

708
00:47:21,922 --> 00:47:23,591
- No, Alicia.

709
00:47:23,591 --> 00:47:25,051
Don't disappoint me.

710
00:47:27,428 --> 00:47:29,263
- Just relax, Rob, okay?

711
00:47:29,263 --> 00:47:31,724
(eerie music)

712
00:47:51,327 --> 00:47:53,996
- I just wasn't sure if you
were right for the series.

713
00:47:56,165 --> 00:47:56,916
- And now?

714
00:47:58,918 --> 00:48:03,130
- Now, I think I might be
able to fit you right in.

715
00:48:06,425 --> 00:48:09,387
(nail gun thudding)

716
00:48:18,312 --> 00:48:21,107
(traffic roaring)

717
00:48:23,859 --> 00:48:26,904
- Forensics report on victim
number one, Paula Brown.

718
00:48:26,904 --> 00:48:28,823
I knew you'd wanna see it.

719
00:48:28,823 --> 00:48:29,740
- It's about time.

720
00:48:38,416 --> 00:48:39,792
She was pregnant?

721
00:48:45,798 --> 00:48:48,843
- Let's get started, shall we?

722
00:48:50,136 --> 00:48:52,680
- Good, how do you want me?

723
00:48:52,680 --> 00:48:54,306
- Do something provocative.

724
00:48:58,144 --> 00:48:58,936
- Like this?

725
00:49:02,815 --> 00:49:04,483
- [Rob] Now turn from the light.

726
00:49:07,153 --> 00:49:09,864

728
00:49:41,228 --> 00:49:46,192

738
00:50:41,622 --> 00:50:42,790

741
00:50:57,721 --> 00:51:00,224
- Oh, Rob Sorrel.

742
00:51:00,224 --> 00:51:02,977
Yes, I've repped him in the past.

743
00:51:02,977 --> 00:51:04,937
He was promising once.

744
00:51:04,937 --> 00:51:08,732
Now, he's just another insane artist.

745
00:51:08,732 --> 00:51:11,443
- Well, do you have any idea
where he might be living?

746
00:51:11,443 --> 00:51:13,737
- No, not anymore.

747
00:51:13,737 --> 00:51:15,614
You might start looking downtown

748
00:51:15,614 --> 00:51:17,199

749
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:23,747
But, if you are really
serious about buying

00:51:23,747 --> 00:51:25,874
some really excellent contemporary art,

751
00:51:25,874 --> 00:51:27,376
you should come to our opening.

752
00:51:30,963 --> 00:51:33,799
- Did you stop representing him

753
00:51:33,799 --> 00:51:35,467
because you thought he was crazy?

754
00:51:36,427 --> 00:51:40,014

- No.

762
00:52:03,245 --> 00:52:06,624
I keep thinking about Paula,
and what happened to her.

763
00:52:06,624 --> 00:52:09,001

00:57:24,066 --> 00:57:24,858

833
00:57:25,901 --> 00:57:27,694
- Be all right?
- Yeah.

834
00:57:29,237 --> 00:57:33,867

and let you go ahead and...

Father Tyrone.

839

She was in a bit of trouble.

841
01:00:00,972 --> 01:00:03,308
She needed a bed for the night.

842
01:00:03,308 --> 01:00:04,851
- I see.

843
01:00:04,851 --> 01:00:05,769
- How can I help you?

844
01:00:05,769 --> 01:00:09,189
- Oh, it's nothing of import.

845

850
01:00:31,795 --> 01:00:32,838
- Well, I'm not saying

851
01:00:32,838 --> 01:00:35,674
she never attended services at St. Joe's,

852
01:00:35,674 --> 01:00:37,843
but she was not a parishioner.

853
01:00:37,843 --> 01:00:38,718
Oh no, no.

854
01:00:38,718 --> 01:00:41,179
A girl like this would, well,

855
01:00:41,179 --> 01:00:44,349
she would've stood out
among our congregation.

856
01:00:45,433 --> 01:00:48,228
- [Cop] Father Tyrone claims
he visited Paula Brown

857
01:00:48,228 --> 01:00:50,313
in her apartment because
she was a parishioner.

858
01:00:50,313 --> 01:00:51,773
- Well, I can't imagine

859
01:00:51,773 --> 01:00:54,317
what would've made him
say a thing like that.

860
01:00:54,317 --> 01:00:56,153
- You ever seen this woman in church?

861
01:00:56,153 --> 01:00:57,654
- No, never.

862
01:00:57,654 --> 01:01:00,699
Well like I said, she
was not a parishioner.

863
01:01:00,699 --> 01:01:04,661
But Father Tyrone's behavior
was always somewhat unorthodox.

864
01:01:06,288 --> 01:01:08,206
And as it now would appear,

865
01:01:08,206 --> 01:01:13,128
he's also overly susceptible
to temptations of the flesh.

866
01:01:17,048 --> 01:01:19,593
(sign buzzing)

867
01:01:21,303 --> 01:01:23,847

872
01:01:42,240 --> 01:01:44,034

877

878
01:02:23,990 --> 01:02:26,284
- Now, what do we have here?

879
01:02:31,998 --> 01:02:36,044
Do the initials DT mean anything to you?

880
01:02:37,420 --> 01:02:40,090
- Father Daniel-
- Tyrone, yeah.

881
01:02:41,216 --> 01:02:43,843
I think we've had enough of
this Holy Ghost bullshit.

882
01:02:47,055 --> 01:02:48,556
- Bless me Father, for I have sinned.

883
01:02:48,556 --> 01:02:51,142
It's been a month since
my last confession.

884
01:02:51,142 --> 01:02:55,063
- May the Father, Son, and
Holy Spirit be in your mind

885
01:02:55,063 --> 01:02:57,899
that you may rightly confess your sins.

886
01:02:57,899 --> 01:03:01,236
- But first, I need you to
do something for me, Father.

887
01:03:03,154 --> 01:03:03,947
- What's that?

888
01:03:05,448 --> 01:03:07,701
- I need my paintings back,

889
01:03:07,701 --> 01:03:10,495
and I need you to leave me the hell alone!

890
01:03:12,789 --> 01:03:14,249
- You came here to confess?

891
01:03:15,250 --> 01:03:20,130
- Oh yes, I've killed women, Father.

892
01:03:20,130 --> 01:03:21,006
It's terrible.

893
01:03:22,173 --> 01:03:25,760
But then, something happens.

894
01:03:25,760 --> 01:03:29,264
I begin to create beautiful images.

895
01:03:30,557 --> 01:03:33,184
Isn't it strange how beauty
can come from wickedness?

896
01:03:35,895 --> 01:03:36,688
- It won't work.

897
01:03:38,982 --> 01:03:40,775
- For these sins and all
the sins of my past life,

898
01:03:40,775 --> 01:03:41,735
I ask absolution.

899
01:03:41,735 --> 01:03:44,195
- I already know what you did.

900
01:03:45,947 --> 01:03:50,201
You can't use confession
to make me silent.

901
01:03:50,201 --> 01:03:52,746
- I came to you to tell
my sins to God alone!

902
01:03:52,746 --> 01:03:57,751
- You came to me to silence
the only witness against you,

903
01:03:57,751 --> 01:04:00,003
you murdering little bastard!

904
01:04:01,546 --> 01:04:04,841
(haunting choral music)

905
01:04:10,263 --> 01:04:12,724
(doors creak)

906
01:04:17,228 --> 01:04:18,730
- [Cop] Father Tyrone.

907
01:04:18,730 --> 01:04:19,522
- Jefferson.

908
01:04:20,648 --> 01:04:23,651
The man that just came out
this way is your killer.

909
01:04:23,651 --> 01:04:24,486
- What man?

910
01:04:24,486 --> 01:04:26,446
- The man that just came out this way.

911
01:04:26,446 --> 01:04:28,031
- I didn't see no one leave.

912
01:04:28,031 --> 01:04:29,657
Listen, Father, we're gonna need you

913
01:04:29,657 --> 01:04:31,368
to clear up a few things.

914
01:04:31,368 --> 01:04:32,994
- Goddamn it, Lieutenant!

915
01:04:32,994 --> 01:04:35,038
Sorrel was just here.

916
01:04:35,038 --> 01:04:37,165
- Father, this isn't easy for me,

917
01:04:37,165 --> 01:04:38,333
but I'm afraid I'm gonna have to ask you

918
01:04:38,333 --> 01:04:39,751
to come in for questioning.

919
01:04:39,751 --> 01:04:42,212
(police radio crackles)

920
01:04:42,212 --> 01:04:46,966
- Clearly, I left them at Paula's.

921
01:04:46,966 --> 01:04:51,221
The killer found them, and
planted them at the murder scene.

922
01:04:52,555 --> 01:04:56,434
- Father, you're the only
priest I know with a rap sheet.

923
01:04:57,560 --> 01:04:58,978
We hauled in a gang member the other day

924
01:04:58,978 --> 01:05:01,481
who said you pulled a gun on him.

925
01:05:01,481 --> 01:05:03,817
And to top it off, we
find some stolen evidence

926
01:05:03,817 --> 01:05:07,362
along with nude paintings of
three victims in your bedroom.

927
01:05:07,362 --> 01:05:09,072
Now you tell me, what the,

928
01:05:09,072 --> 01:05:10,698
what am I supposed to believe?

929
01:05:10,698 --> 01:05:13,493
- We've been through
this, it's circumstantial.

930
01:05:14,786 --> 01:05:17,622
- [Jefferson] Maybe, but there's more.

931
01:05:18,832 --> 01:05:20,458
You were in Bakersfield recently.

932
01:05:21,709 --> 01:05:25,797
- Well, if that's a crime then I'm guilty.

933
01:05:25,797 --> 01:05:28,466
- No, but murder is.

934
01:05:30,343 --> 01:05:32,971
The woman you visited is dead.

935
01:05:34,514 --> 01:05:35,390
- What?

936
01:05:35,390 --> 01:05:37,976
- It happened the day
you were there, same MO.

937
01:05:37,976 --> 01:05:38,977
Coincidence?

938
01:05:41,688 --> 01:05:43,982
- Oh god, who are they?

939
01:05:43,982 --> 01:05:45,942
- They're the girls in
your paintings, Father.

940
01:05:45,942 --> 01:05:47,652
All three killed the same way,

941
01:05:47,652 --> 01:05:49,487
strangled with picture hanging wire.

942
01:05:49,487 --> 01:05:51,823
The same way Paula Brown was murdered.

943
01:05:52,824 --> 01:05:55,660
- Rob Sorrel is an artist.

944
01:05:55,660 --> 01:05:58,413
He would have had that kind of wire.

945
01:06:00,373 --> 01:06:02,834
- Yeah, well,

946
01:06:04,210 --> 01:06:06,796
we've done a background
check on this Sorrel.

947
01:06:06,796 --> 01:06:09,382
He's been dead for six months.

948
01:06:09,382 --> 01:06:10,383
- What?

949
01:06:10,383 --> 01:06:11,926
- Suicide.

950
01:06:11,926 --> 01:06:13,678
They found his body in the LA river.

951
01:06:15,430 --> 01:06:17,599
Where are the wires
that's usually attached

952
01:06:17,599 --> 01:06:19,517
to the back of those paintings, Father?

953
01:06:20,685 --> 01:06:23,813
- The paintings weren't hanging.

954
01:06:23,813 --> 01:06:28,776
- No, but you might be.

955
01:06:29,194 --> 01:06:30,528
- [Rainy] You know, I didn't know

956
01:06:30,528 --> 01:06:32,322
that Sorrel was found dead.

957
01:06:32,322 --> 01:06:33,490
- He wasn't.

958
01:06:33,490 --> 01:06:34,657
I was just bullshitting.

959
01:06:36,075 --> 01:06:37,702
He's been missing for six months.

960
01:06:38,620 --> 01:06:40,497
The record suggests suicide.

961
01:06:41,831 --> 01:06:45,251
You see, he has a history
with several failed attempts.

962
01:06:45,251 --> 01:06:46,753
- Now wait a minute, didn't Tyrone say

963
01:06:46,753 --> 01:06:48,254
that the mother saw him recently?

964
01:06:48,254 --> 01:06:51,299
- Yeah, but the neighbor
said the mother was nuts.

965
01:06:51,299 --> 01:06:53,968
She imagined her son was with her

966
01:06:53,968 --> 01:06:55,345
whenever she went to church.

967
01:06:57,805 --> 01:06:59,057
- [Alicia] When I was a little girl,

968
01:06:59,057 --> 01:07:01,226
and I went to confession,

969
01:07:01,226 --> 01:07:02,560
I'd make everything up.

970
01:07:03,561 --> 01:07:07,649
I'd have felt so guilty for
not committing any sins,

971
01:07:07,649 --> 01:07:09,984
or at least none that I can remember.

972
01:07:09,984 --> 01:07:10,777
- There.

973
01:07:13,154 --> 01:07:14,447
That's enough for tonight.

974
01:07:19,452 --> 01:07:20,995
You're close to being finished.

975
01:07:22,247 --> 01:07:24,374
- Well, I can't wait to see it.

976
01:07:24,374 --> 01:07:25,458
I know I'm gonna love it.

977
01:07:25,458 --> 01:07:27,835
- If you look at it now,
you'll be disappointed.

978
01:07:29,837 --> 01:07:30,713
Trust me.

979
01:07:43,142 --> 01:07:46,104
Ah, that's not such a good idea, either.

980
01:07:47,355 --> 01:07:49,399
- Maybe you're right.
- I am.

981
01:07:52,944 --> 01:07:54,195
- [Alicia] What's wrong, Rob?

982
01:07:55,154 --> 01:07:57,282
- What happened to your vow, Alicia?

983
01:07:57,282 --> 01:07:59,742
(eerie music)

984
01:08:01,035 --> 01:08:04,539
- All this time, I've
been waiting for something

985
01:08:05,873 --> 01:08:07,458
special and sacred.

986
01:08:10,587 --> 01:08:13,798
I don't feel I have to wait any longer.

987
01:08:15,383 --> 01:08:17,927
- Well, at least you're honest.

988
01:08:22,890 --> 01:08:25,643
Do me a favor?

989
01:08:25,643 --> 01:08:28,354
Lock the door.

990
01:08:28,354 --> 01:08:30,648
- We're in the middle of nowhere, Rob.

991
01:08:30,648 --> 01:08:31,441
- Just,

992
01:08:34,110 --> 01:08:35,236
lock the door.

993
01:08:41,034 --> 01:08:44,329
(haunting choral music)

994
01:09:24,118 --> 01:09:26,829
(Alicia panting)

995
01:09:39,717 --> 01:09:41,636
(wings flapping)

996
01:09:41,636 --> 01:09:42,637
- [Nicole] You know Father,

997
01:09:42,637 --> 01:09:45,223
if they really thought you
were guilty, you'd be in jail.

998
01:09:45,223 --> 01:09:48,017
- Somehow, that is not
a comforting thought.

999
01:09:55,108 --> 01:09:58,611
Just, a bit lost.

1000
01:10:02,323 --> 01:10:06,160
- Yeah, I know you're a priest and all,

1001
01:10:06,160 --> 01:10:09,914
but are you attracted to me?

1002
01:10:11,624 --> 01:10:14,419
- More than someone in
my position should be.

1003
01:10:14,419 --> 01:10:17,046
- But not like you were
attracted to Paula, right?

1004
01:10:18,131 --> 01:10:21,300
I mean, you were her lover, weren't you?

1005
01:10:22,760 --> 01:10:23,553
- Oh no.

1006
01:10:26,431 --> 01:10:27,223
Come here.

1007
01:10:33,896 --> 01:10:34,689
Nicole?

1008
01:10:38,401 --> 01:10:40,737
Paula was my daughter.

1009
01:10:40,737 --> 01:10:41,487
- What?

1010
01:10:43,156 --> 01:10:47,744
- The single greatest regret of my life

1011
01:10:47,744 --> 01:10:49,746
is that she never knew
how much I loved her.

1012
01:11:03,676 --> 01:11:06,471
- You know, they're
gonna keep watching us,

1013
01:11:06,471 --> 01:11:07,847
and following us.

1014
01:11:10,266 --> 01:11:11,726
- [Alicia] Where are you going?

1015
01:11:11,726 --> 01:11:12,560
- Wait for me here.

1016
01:11:12,560 --> 01:11:14,437
I have to go visit a friend.

1017
01:11:15,438 --> 01:11:17,231
- [Alicia] I wanna go with you.

1018
01:11:17,231 --> 01:11:18,441
- Just stay here.

1019
01:11:24,030 --> 01:11:26,574
(door rattles)

1020
01:11:45,510 --> 01:11:48,054
(fan whirring)

1021
01:11:55,311 --> 01:11:58,105
(classical music)

1022
01:11:59,732 --> 01:12:02,693
(people chattering)

1023
01:12:32,223 --> 01:12:33,933
Long time, Clyde.
- Oh, excuse me.

1024
01:12:35,893 --> 01:12:38,104
Ah, Mr. Sorrel.

1025
01:12:39,355 --> 01:12:41,983
I don't remember inviting you here.

1026
01:12:41,983 --> 01:12:42,859
- Easy oversight.

1027
01:12:44,026 --> 01:12:47,071
By the way, my series is nearly finished.

1028
01:12:47,071 --> 01:12:48,406
I want you to reconsider.

1029
01:12:50,533 --> 01:12:53,870
- You must be here because of the priest.

1030
01:12:55,037 --> 01:12:56,247
- What?

1031
01:12:56,247 --> 01:12:57,707
- YES.

1032
01:12:57,707 --> 01:13:02,670
Apparently, Rob, he is
your biggest and best fan.

1033
01:13:04,130 --> 01:13:07,884
Or, you've stopped going to mass.

1034
01:13:07,884 --> 01:13:10,052
- What priest, Father Tyrone?

1035
01:13:10,052 --> 01:13:11,554
What did you tell him?

1036
01:13:11,554 --> 01:13:12,930
(People gasping)

1037
01:13:12,930 --> 01:13:14,432
- I never lie, Rob.

1038
01:13:14,432 --> 01:13:16,642
Especially not to a priest.

1039
01:13:16,642 --> 01:13:18,102
I told him that your paintings

1040
01:13:18,102 --> 01:13:21,230
were self-indulgent, overrated crap.

1041
01:13:21,230 --> 01:13:24,150
(people laughing)

1042
01:13:24,150 --> 01:13:27,570
(Rob chuckles)

1043
01:13:27,570 --> 01:13:29,113
(Rob yells)

1044
01:13:29,113 --> 01:13:34,076
(table clatters)
(people gasping)

1045
01:13:37,330 --> 01:13:38,456
- That's okay.

1046
01:13:40,833 --> 01:13:42,126
- The guy who painted this?

1047
01:13:44,962 --> 01:13:45,880
He can't even fuck.

1048
01:13:45,880 --> 01:13:49,425
(People gasping)

1049
01:13:49,425 --> 01:13:52,929
(glass tinkles)

1050
01:13:52,929 --> 01:13:54,430
- [Woman] Stay back!

1051
01:13:54,430 --> 01:13:55,765
- [Man] Let's get out of here.

1052
01:13:58,142 --> 01:13:59,477
- Should I call the police?

1053
01:13:59,477 --> 01:14:01,687
- No don't, we don't need the publicity.

1054
01:14:02,897 --> 01:14:04,315
The little prick.

1055
01:14:07,693 --> 01:14:09,195
Performance artists.

1056
01:14:09,195 --> 01:14:10,863
(people laughing)

1057
01:14:10,863 --> 01:14:11,906
- [Man] Oh that was (laughs).

1058
01:14:15,618 --> 01:14:16,619
- Guess what, Alicia?

1059
01:14:18,079 --> 01:14:20,456
(Rob laughs)

1060
01:14:33,010 --> 01:14:35,179
(ominous music)

1061
01:14:35,179 --> 01:14:37,974
(Alicia shudders)

1062
01:14:41,727 --> 01:14:46,607
I guess I was wrong about
the color of your soul.

1063
01:14:46,607 --> 01:14:50,194
The good news is, you'll fit
in nicely with the series.

1064
01:14:53,447 --> 01:14:54,907
I'll be back at seven o'clock.

1065
01:14:55,825 --> 01:14:57,034
- What?

1066
01:14:57,034 --> 01:14:58,577
- I have things to take care of.

1067
01:15:00,121 --> 01:15:01,831
Don't go anywhere.

1068
01:15:05,501 --> 01:15:07,003
- Rob.

1069
01:15:07,003 --> 01:15:08,295
- This is important to me.

1070
01:15:09,505 --> 01:15:12,717
(door rattles)

1071
01:15:12,717 --> 01:15:14,093
We have to purify ourselves.

1072
01:15:16,137 --> 01:15:18,681
(door rattles)

1073
01:15:18,681 --> 01:15:21,308
(ominous music)

1074
01:15:38,951 --> 01:15:41,495
(somber music)

1075
01:15:53,549 --> 01:15:56,677
(motorcycle rumbling)

1076
01:16:00,139 --> 01:16:04,226
- I wanna see both your daughter and Jose,

1077
01:16:04,226 --> 01:16:06,228
same time Thursday, okay?

1078
01:16:08,105 --> 01:16:11,358
- Well, I don't know if they will come.

1079
01:16:13,861 --> 01:16:17,114
- Francine, put the fear of
God in them, they'll come.

1080
01:16:18,491 --> 01:16:21,452
(door creaks)
(suspenseful music)

1081
01:16:21,452 --> 01:16:22,369
- Father Tyrone?

1082
01:16:29,001 --> 01:16:29,794
Dan?

1083
01:16:36,717 --> 01:16:38,010
Are you ever home?

1084
01:16:38,010 --> 01:16:40,638
(ominous music)

1085
01:16:43,766 --> 01:16:46,477
(Nicole gagging)

1086
01:16:50,064 --> 01:16:52,691
(glass tinkles)

1087
01:16:54,819 --> 01:16:56,987
(wings flapping)

1088
01:16:56,987 --> 01:16:59,532
(somber music)

1089
01:17:06,831 --> 01:17:08,124
- Father Tyrone.

1090
01:17:10,501 --> 01:17:12,837
(Monsignor gasps)

1091
01:17:12,837 --> 01:17:13,963
Mother of God.

1092
01:17:20,845 --> 01:17:23,472
(phone dialing)

1093
01:17:27,601 --> 01:17:29,395
There's been a murder.

1094
01:17:35,609 --> 01:17:37,945
- Bless me Father, for I have sinned.

1095
01:17:37,945 --> 01:17:40,698
It's been six months
since my last confession.

1096
01:17:40,698 --> 01:17:44,160
Father, I'm only 18 and I
did a very stupid thing.

1097
01:17:46,620 --> 01:17:49,957
I'm not married, but I slept with a man.

1098
01:17:51,250 --> 01:17:54,670
- The world is full of temptations.

1099
01:17:54,670 --> 01:17:55,504
- Father, I know.

1100
01:17:56,714 --> 01:17:58,048
But it was my fault.

1101
01:18:00,342 --> 01:18:03,804
He's very intense, an artist.

1102
01:18:05,264 --> 01:18:06,056
He paints me.

1103
01:18:07,474 --> 01:18:08,893
I don't know.

1104
01:18:08,893 --> 01:18:12,479
For a while, he made me feel important.

1105
01:18:14,398 --> 01:18:16,400
Now he makes me feel so dirty.

1106
01:18:17,526 --> 01:18:19,987
This scares me, Father.

1107
01:18:19,987 --> 01:18:20,863
- Rob Sorrel?

1108
01:18:23,908 --> 01:18:24,700
- [Alicia] Yes.

1109
01:18:26,327 --> 01:18:28,287
Father, how do you know?

1110
01:18:30,581 --> 01:18:32,708
- God knows many things.

1111
01:18:32,708 --> 01:18:35,294
Where does he live?

1112
01:18:35,294 --> 01:18:36,962
- What does that matter, Father?

1113
01:18:39,256 --> 01:18:41,508
- In God's name, child!

1114
01:18:41,508 --> 01:18:43,886
Where does he live?

1115
01:18:43,886 --> 01:18:45,471
- 613 Sixth Street.

1116
01:18:45,471 --> 01:18:47,264
It's five blocks from here.

1117
01:18:47,264 --> 01:18:50,142
- You are in danger, stay here.

1118
01:18:50,142 --> 01:18:51,477
- [Alicia] But Father!

1119
01:18:51,477 --> 01:18:52,436
- You're absolved.

1120
01:18:52,436 --> 01:18:56,357
Say 10 hail Marys, and
for God's sake, stay here!

1121
01:18:58,692 --> 01:19:01,320
(ominous music)

1122
01:19:13,791 --> 01:19:15,876
- What are you doing here?

1123
01:19:15,876 --> 01:19:17,711
- Rob, you scared me.

1124
01:19:17,711 --> 01:19:19,088
- Why are you here?

1125
01:19:21,590 --> 01:19:24,927
- You were right about feeling
better after confession.

1126
01:19:24,927 --> 01:19:25,719
I had to.

1127
01:19:27,388 --> 01:19:28,264
- Let's go.

1128
01:19:31,183 --> 01:19:33,644
(door creaks)

1129
01:19:35,688 --> 01:19:36,480
- Oh, oh.

1130
01:19:38,691 --> 01:19:39,483
Oh.

1131
01:19:43,862 --> 01:19:45,239
God.

1132
01:19:45,239 --> 01:19:47,783
(somber music)

1133
01:20:03,424 --> 01:20:04,800
- That's him, that's the man!

1134
01:20:04,800 --> 01:20:06,135
- Hold it right there.

1135
01:20:06,135 --> 01:20:08,762
(intense music)

1136
01:20:16,729 --> 01:20:18,856
(engine rumbling)

1137
01:20:18,856 --> 01:20:20,441
(tires squeal)

1138
01:20:20,441 --> 01:20:21,233
Stop!

1139
01:20:23,068 --> 01:20:24,320
(tires squeal)

1140
01:20:24,320 --> 01:20:26,947
(siren wailing)

1141
01:20:30,909 --> 01:20:33,912
(police radio crackling)

1142
01:20:33,912 --> 01:20:36,707
(tires squealing)

1143
01:20:47,009 --> 01:20:49,803
(tires squealing)

1144
01:20:53,140 --> 01:20:56,101
(suspenseful music)

1145
01:21:03,984 --> 01:21:05,861
- What are you doing?

1146
01:21:05,861 --> 01:21:07,196
Stop it!

1147
01:21:07,196 --> 01:21:10,699
(sirens wailing)
(police radio crackling)

1148
01:21:10,699 --> 01:21:12,159
(intense music)

1149
01:21:12,159 --> 01:21:14,953
(tires squealing)

1150
01:21:40,729 --> 01:21:45,651
(eerie music)
(fluid splashing)

1151
01:22:02,918 --> 01:22:03,877
Rob, please.

1152
01:22:05,087 --> 01:22:06,213
Don't do this.

1153
01:22:10,843 --> 01:22:12,803
- Alicia, I do love you.

1154
01:22:18,183 --> 01:22:19,852
I'll always love you.

1155
01:22:22,855 --> 01:22:25,983
Everyone waits for the
church to save them.

1156
01:22:29,945 --> 01:22:31,947
Where's the precious church now?

1157
01:22:31,947 --> 01:22:33,323
(Alicia gasps)
- Right here.

1158
01:22:35,367 --> 01:22:36,160
Rob?

1159
01:22:37,494 --> 01:22:39,288
You failed to obtain absolution

1160
01:22:39,288 --> 01:22:41,665
from the almighty and merciful God

1161
01:22:41,665 --> 01:22:44,209
on your last visit to the confessional.

1162
01:22:44,209 --> 01:22:46,253
(sirens wailing)

1163
01:22:46,253 --> 01:22:49,715
- I don't want your worthless absolution!

1164
01:22:49,715 --> 01:22:54,678
- The chosen must expect
temptation almost beyond endurance.

1165
01:22:56,597 --> 01:22:58,682
- I was never chosen.

1166
01:22:58,682 --> 01:23:00,100
(tires squeal)

1167
01:23:00,100 --> 01:23:02,436
- Rob, God chose you.

1168
01:23:02,436 --> 01:23:04,980
<i>'</i> No!

1169
01:23:04,980 --> 01:23:06,607
(gun fires)
(Alicia yelps)

1170
01:23:06,607 --> 01:23:09,234
(both grunting)

1171
01:23:13,280 --> 01:23:15,824
(gun clatters)

1172
01:23:18,952 --> 01:23:23,916
(flames roaring)
- Run!

1173
01:23:25,209 --> 01:23:27,836
(both grunting)

1174
01:23:33,884 --> 01:23:36,678
(cans clattering)

1175
01:23:51,902 --> 01:23:53,111
- I'm going straight to hell, Father,

1176
01:23:53,111 --> 01:23:54,988
and I'd hate to make the trip alone.

1177
01:23:55,989 --> 01:23:57,574
(nail gun whirring)

1178
01:23:57,574 --> 01:24:00,536
(nail gun thudding)

1179
01:24:01,411 --> 01:24:06,083
(suspenseful music)
(flames roaring)

1180
01:24:06,083 --> 01:24:08,710
(both groaning)

1181
01:24:10,003 --> 01:24:12,965
(nail gun thudding)

1182
01:24:17,177 --> 01:24:19,805
(both groaning)

1183
01:24:21,098 --> 01:24:23,684
(nail gun thuds)
No!

1184
01:24:23,684 --> 01:24:26,061
(dramatic music)

1185
01:24:26,061 --> 01:24:28,689
(both grunting)

1186
01:24:47,958 --> 01:24:50,502
(both panting)

1187
01:25:04,308 --> 01:25:05,601
- You wanna die!

1188
01:25:07,185 --> 01:25:09,896
(flames roaring)

1189
01:25:20,157 --> 01:25:23,327
- Bless me Father, for I have sinned.

1190
01:25:23,327 --> 01:25:28,248
(flames crackling)
(eerie music)

1191
01:25:33,754 --> 01:25:37,007
- I absolve you in the name of the Father,

1192
01:25:37,215 --> 01:25:39,926
Son, and Holy Spirit.

1193
01:25:40,344 --> 01:25:43,221
(flames crackling)

1194
01:25:49,686 --> 01:25:52,981
(haunting choral music)

1195
01:26:17,255 --> 01:26:19,966
(sirens wailing)

1196
01:26:31,687 --> 01:26:35,065
(police radio crackling)

1197
01:26:52,499 --> 01:26:57,462
(explosions booming)
(flames crackling)

1198
01:27:16,565 --> 01:27:19,109
