It did.

30
00:02:43,935 --> 00:02:47,203

stone did not lead you astray?

that I won't crush your skull

Neither one, sire,

they are his guards.

87
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:04,856
They should feel the
power of the Neptonian chant

No, he needs to find his balance,

for a lesson, he could die.

So sire, what did you do to that goon?

I pulled his energy and essence

152

00:15:11,149 --> 00:15:13,651
Yeah, it's dangerous for
her to be in these woods.

187
00:15:15,253 --> 00:15:17,052
I am your queen!

188
00:15:17,054 --> 00:15:20,625
You serve Sil's republic,
which means you serve me!

189
00:15:21,526 --> 00:15:25,795
So stand the fuck down!

190
00:15:25,797 --> 00:15:30,802
No, no, I don't listen to you!

191
00:15:31,035 --> 00:15:32,270
I listen to me.

192
00:15:33,304 --> 00:15:34,806
I was a Tyramglin,

193
00:15:35,773 --> 00:15:37,108
rich and strong,

194
00:15:38,409 --> 00:15:40,745
but now, nothing but a goon.

195
00:15:43,014 --> 00:15:47,316
Created by your master to
roam this forest forever,

196
00:15:47,318 --> 00:15:49,018
living off the dead.

197
00:15:49,020 --> 00:15:50,822
I don't give a shit.

198
00:15:52,056 --> 00:15:53,691
Get the fuck outta my way.

199
00:15:54,725 --> 00:15:58,527
Kill “The Daughter of Demons”
and be praised,

200
00:15:58,529 --> 00:16:00,865
show that we are the demons to be feared

201
00:16:01,999 --> 00:16:03,100
and be rewarded.

202
00:16:04,035 --> 00:16:06,904
Yes, yes.

203
00:16:08,239 --> 00:16:09,273
Do her slow,

204
00:16:10,875 --> 00:16:13,845
bring back pieces for us to taste.

205
00:16:18,482 --> 00:16:19,317
Yes.

206
00:16:20,184 --> 00:16:21,018
Yes.

207
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:24,455
You goons are fucking delusional.

208
00:16:26,390 --> 00:16:28,893
But I see you want this to happen anyways.

209
00:16:30,995 --> 00:16:31,829
Fine.

210
00:16:33,164 --> 00:16:36,834
My blade will not be soiled
with your disgusting blood.

211
00:16:40,304 --> 00:16:41,839
I'm gonna break you by hand,

212
00:16:48,779 --> 00:16:49,614
painfully.

213
00:16:52,950 --> 00:16:56,921
Yes, yes, I can almost taste you.

214
00:17:00,892 --> 00:17:02,059
You're mine!

215
00:17:05,963 --> 00:17:08,733
[blows thudding]

216
00:17:37,495 --> 00:17:39,762
[bone snapping]

217
00:17:39,764 --> 00:17:42,433
[goon shouting]

218
00:17:54,011 --> 00:17:56,781
[goon screaming]

219
00:17:58,816 --> 00:18:01,586
[goon screaming] You broke my arms!

220
00:18:24,442 --> 00:18:27,111
[goon groaning]

221
00:18:34,285 --> 00:18:35,720
No, no, please!

222
00:18:42,326 --> 00:18:43,160
Please!

223
00:18:44,161 --> 00:18:45,696
Have mercy, my queen,

224
00:18:47,565 --> 00:18:48,866
I'll do whatever.

225
00:18:50,101 --> 00:18:52,770
[goon shouting]

226
00:18:54,538 --> 00:18:56,173
Shhhhh.

227
00:18:56,974 --> 00:18:58,609
I understand.

228
00:19:00,578 --> 00:19:05,082
I understand Goon, living in these woods,

229
00:19:06,117 --> 00:19:09,887
it's terrible, I know, I know,

230
00:19:11,589 --> 00:19:13,422
you were just trying to do something

231
00:19:13,424 --> 00:19:15,092
to make you famous, right?

232
00:19:17,194 --> 00:19:20,698
Thinking Sil would give
you your life back?

233
00:19:23,034 --> 00:19:26,470
I respect a man who dares stand up to me.

234
00:19:30,074 --> 00:19:32,109
But you are no man.

235
00:19:36,013 --> 00:19:38,749
[blows thudding]

236
00:20:08,345 --> 00:20:09,713
Commander, are you okay?

237
00:20:11,582 --> 00:20:12,850
- Whoa.
- Come on.

238
00:20:19,790 --> 00:20:22,860
[waterfalls roaring]

239
00:21:30,728 --> 00:21:33,631
[shower splashing]

240
00:21:45,276 --> 00:21:47,209
[clears throat]

241
00:21:47,211 --> 00:21:49,011
[Aressa] Who's there?

242
00:21:49,013 --> 00:21:52,481
Hi, my name is Orin.

243
00:21:52,483 --> 00:21:53,815
Sorry to bother you, miss.

244
00:21:53,817 --> 00:21:55,450
I was just looking for some dry clothes

245
00:21:55,452 --> 00:21:57,419
and I heard the water running.

246
00:21:57,421 --> 00:21:58,387
[Aressa] Are you alone?

247
00:21:58,389 --> 00:21:59,590
Yeah, yeah, I'm alone.

248
00:22:00,524 --> 00:22:01,358
Are you sure?

249
00:22:02,393 --> 00:22:04,259
Yes, I'm alone.

250
00:22:04,261 --> 00:22:05,963
Just me, see?

251
00:22:07,331 --> 00:22:09,867
Okay, okay, you can
put your arms down now.

252
00:22:13,671 --> 00:22:15,673
So, Orin, are you taken?

253
00:22:18,008 --> 00:22:19,510
Uh, what was that?

254
00:22:20,811 --> 00:22:24,580
I asked, are you taken,
do you have a girlfriend?

255
00:22:24,582 --> 00:22:26,782
No, no, not right now.

256
00:22:26,784 --> 00:22:27,716
Maybe one day.

257
00:22:27,718 --> 00:22:31,220
Orin, relax, I'm just fucking with you,

258
00:22:31,222 --> 00:22:33,255
just wanted to be the
first to break the ice,

259
00:22:33,257 --> 00:22:34,089
that's all.

260
00:22:34,091 --> 00:22:36,091
Right, break the ice.

261
00:22:36,093 --> 00:22:39,430
Sorry, it's just been a long, long day.

262
00:22:40,397 --> 00:22:41,398
Quite sure it has.

263
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,800
Hey, can you go in that closet over there

264
00:22:44,802 --> 00:22:46,869
and hand me a towel, please?

265
00:22:46,871 --> 00:22:49,404
Sure, anyone in particular?

266
00:22:49,406 --> 00:22:50,241
No.

267
00:22:52,443 --> 00:22:54,076
Hurry up, Orin, it's cold.

268
00:22:54,078 --> 00:22:55,577
Sorry, here you go.

269
00:22:55,579 --> 00:22:56,745
Thank you.

270
00:22:56,747 --> 00:22:58,380
Can I ask you something?

271
00:22:58,382 --> 00:22:59,314
Yeah.

272
00:22:59,316 --> 00:23:00,716
What's your name?

273
00:23:00,718 --> 00:23:03,518
Good question, Aressa.

274
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:05,787
It's nice to meet you, Aressa.

275
00:23:05,789 --> 00:23:07,992
It's nice to meet you too, Orin.

276
00:23:11,996 --> 00:23:15,130
So, how did you survive in
this house during the invasion?

277
00:23:15,132 --> 00:23:16,865
There was an invasion, right?

278
00:23:16,867 --> 00:23:17,900
Yeah.

279
00:23:17,902 --> 00:23:21,169
Can you actually go over there
and get those clothes for me?

280
00:23:21,171 --> 00:23:22,304
Sure.

281
00:23:22,306 --> 00:23:25,474
[eerie music]

282
00:23:25,476 --> 00:23:28,646
Were those clothes always there?

283
00:23:30,281 --> 00:23:31,113
Of course they were.

284
00:23:31,115 --> 00:23:34,116
You stepped over them
earlier, don't you remember?

285
00:23:34,118 --> 00:23:36,251
How did you know what I just-

286
00:23:36,253 --> 00:23:38,253
Did I just say that out loud?

287
00:23:38,255 --> 00:23:39,288
You okay?

288
00:23:39,290 --> 00:23:41,990
Yeah, yeah, I think so.

289
00:23:41,992 --> 00:23:42,991
I guess.

290
00:23:42,993 --> 00:23:44,626
Thank you.

291
00:23:44,628 --> 00:23:46,728
You're quite a character, Orin.

292
00:23:46,730 --> 00:23:48,599
So how did you survive?

293
00:23:50,234 --> 00:23:52,100
By hiding in the sewer.

294
00:23:52,102 --> 00:23:53,302
Ugh.

295
00:23:53,304 --> 00:23:55,337
Yeah, it was terrible,

296
00:23:55,339 --> 00:23:58,473
but it ended up being the perfect place.

297
00:23:58,475 --> 00:24:01,345
Sil's goons never looked there
because it smelled so bad.

298
00:24:02,579 --> 00:24:04,646
What about your family?

299
00:24:04,648 --> 00:24:08,283
Taking as property or
killed before I could escape.

300
00:24:08,285 --> 00:24:10,185
Oh, I'm sorry.

301
00:24:10,187 --> 00:24:11,687
How long ago was this?

302
00:24:11,689 --> 00:24:13,088
About three years ago.

303
00:24:13,090 --> 00:24:13,922
Three years!

304
00:24:13,924 --> 00:24:15,590
And you're still here?

305
00:24:15,592 --> 00:24:17,092
This is my home.

306
00:24:17,094 --> 00:24:20,162
This, this is my home, no one else's!

307
00:24:20,164 --> 00:24:21,096
I understand that,

308
00:24:21,098 --> 00:24:23,966
but there are still people
out there who can help you.

309
00:24:23,968 --> 00:24:24,802
Help me?

310
00:24:25,669 --> 00:24:28,670
Help how, exactly, Orin?

311
00:24:28,672 --> 00:24:30,839
There's nothing out there.

312
00:24:30,841 --> 00:24:32,541
If Sil's goons catch you

313
00:24:32,543 --> 00:24:34,643
you'll be either made to be a servant

314
00:24:34,645 --> 00:24:36,645
or turned into some mindless goon

315
00:24:36,647 --> 00:24:38,146
that feeds off of the dead

316
00:24:38,148 --> 00:24:39,715
and are used as target practice.

317
00:24:39,717 --> 00:24:41,585
No, not me!

318
00:24:43,988 --> 00:24:45,988
This is our world now.

319
00:24:45,990 --> 00:24:48,392
Kill when you have to,
survive however you can.

320
00:24:52,496 --> 00:24:53,362
I still can't believe

321
00:24:53,364 --> 00:24:56,633
that Mother has to fallen
to the devil himself.

322
00:24:58,535 --> 00:24:59,403
There is no hope.

323
00:25:00,371 --> 00:25:01,703
Of course there is, Aressa.

324
00:25:01,705 --> 00:25:03,472
We have to believe in something.

325
00:25:03,474 --> 00:25:06,208
If we don't, we might as
well be dead ourselves.

326
00:25:06,210 --> 00:25:07,209
Maybe we should be.

327
00:25:07,211 --> 00:25:09,611
Come on, don't think like that.

328
00:25:09,613 --> 00:25:11,146
Look, I'm sorry if I upset you.

329
00:25:11,148 --> 00:25:13,817
No, I should apologize.

330
00:25:15,219 --> 00:25:16,051
I didn't mean to snap-

331
00:25:16,053 --> 00:25:18,854
- No, no, I get it, I get it, it's fine.

332
00:25:18,856 --> 00:25:20,924
Things are not normal anymore, I know.

333
00:25:22,326 --> 00:25:25,127
Hey, I saw a symbol for the Resistance

334
00:25:25,129 --> 00:25:26,895
above a door when I got in,
do you know where they are?

335
00:25:26,897 --> 00:25:28,397
Yeah, those fuckers,

336
00:25:28,399 --> 00:25:32,868
they came in, took everything
that wasn't broken and left.

337
00:25:32,870 --> 00:25:34,136
Really?

338
00:25:34,138 --> 00:25:35,470
When was this?

339
00:25:35,472 --> 00:25:38,740
About a year ago, but I
wouldn't worry about them.

340
00:25:38,742 --> 00:25:40,110
They're nothing but thieves.

341
00:25:41,412 --> 00:25:43,178
In a way I don't blame them.

342
00:25:43,180 --> 00:25:44,646
Are you sure?

343
00:25:44,648 --> 00:25:46,481
I hear the leader was a former ambassador

344
00:25:46,483 --> 00:25:48,650
from one of the largest
regions in the north

345
00:25:48,652 --> 00:25:50,819
and then he fled when he found
other fellow world leaders

346
00:25:50,821 --> 00:25:52,687
were in cahoots with Sil

347
00:25:52,689 --> 00:25:55,891
and that his bond with
Mother, it's extremely strong,

348
00:25:55,893 --> 00:25:58,894
strong enough to keep the
Resistance hidden from anyone,

349
00:25:58,896 --> 00:26:00,162
even Sil.

350
00:26:00,164 --> 00:26:02,564
Well, I say, forget them.

351
00:26:02,566 --> 00:26:04,900
Should worry about keeping yourself alive.

352
00:26:04,902 --> 00:26:05,736
Excuse me.

353
00:26:07,504 --> 00:26:09,606
Was that jewelry always there?

354
00:26:11,108 --> 00:26:13,308
You know, you're looking a little tired.

355
00:26:13,310 --> 00:26:16,311
Why don't you have to take
a shower and get some rest?

356
00:26:16,313 --> 00:26:17,979
No, no, thank you.

357
00:26:17,981 --> 00:26:20,649
I can't, I don't have time right now.

358
00:26:20,651 --> 00:26:21,650
Time?

359
00:26:21,652 --> 00:26:25,487
What, are you on a secret
mission and someone's after you?

360
00:26:25,489 --> 00:26:26,321
What?

361
00:26:26,323 --> 00:26:28,090
Why don't you just
take your clothes off,

362
00:26:28,092 --> 00:26:29,991
hop in the shower.

363
00:26:29,993 --> 00:26:31,328
There's no one here but us.

364
00:26:32,362 --> 00:26:33,197
I don't know.

365
00:26:34,298 --> 00:26:36,798
No, I really should be getting going.

366
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:37,634
Orin,

367
00:26:39,503 --> 00:26:41,103
you stink.

368
00:26:41,105 --> 00:26:43,805
Take off these rags, hop in the shower.

369
00:26:43,807 --> 00:26:46,007
I'll keep a lookout for you.

370
00:26:46,009 --> 00:26:48,210
Yeah, I think you're right.

371
00:26:48,212 --> 00:26:49,811
It would be good to wash it off.

372
00:26:49,813 --> 00:26:50,848
Sure it would.

373
00:26:59,490 --> 00:27:01,825
Wow, what a cut.

374
00:27:02,826 --> 00:27:05,329
It looks, beautiful.

375
00:27:07,164 --> 00:27:07,998
What was that?

376
00:27:11,535 --> 00:27:13,370
Come on, let me take my shower first.

377
00:27:15,038 --> 00:27:17,873
[dramatic music]

378
00:27:17,875 --> 00:27:18,707
What are you?

379
00:27:18,709 --> 00:27:19,541
What do you want?

380
00:27:19,543 --> 00:27:22,212
I'm a scavenger, darling,
haven't you heard of us?

381
00:27:24,181 --> 00:27:26,848
We can see your deepest desires

382
00:27:26,850 --> 00:27:28,118
and you desire me!

383
00:27:29,153 --> 00:27:30,919
A scavenger?

384
00:27:30,921 --> 00:27:33,755
Relax, Orin, relax.

385
00:27:33,757 --> 00:27:35,926
I cannot feed until you concede.

386
00:27:36,860 --> 00:27:39,129
Be a good boy, and let me in!

387
00:27:41,331 --> 00:27:43,064
It's been such a long time

388
00:27:43,066 --> 00:27:46,468
since I've dined on bones such as yours,

389
00:27:46,470 --> 00:27:50,774
tight muscles, clean blood, I want you raw!

390
00:27:51,608 --> 00:27:54,611
[scavenger roaring]

391
00:28:07,858 --> 00:28:10,360
I'M HUNGRY, I'M HUNGRY!

392
00:28:20,737 --> 00:28:22,339
Relax, dear, relax,

393
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:25,774
accept your fate, darling.

394
00:28:25,776 --> 00:28:27,544
I cannot feed until you concede.

395
00:28:31,448 --> 00:28:34,618
Roh-Lor-Hi-Eingod!

396
00:28:38,589 --> 00:28:40,524
So you're a Fusionite?

397
00:28:41,558 --> 00:28:43,558
I thought you were all dead.

398
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:45,295
How did you survive, dear?

399
00:28:48,298 --> 00:28:51,034
Your artform doesn't work on me, boy.

400
00:28:51,969 --> 00:28:56,974
Concede to me, let me in.

401
00:28:58,542 --> 00:29:01,211
You wouldn't want to poison me now, do you?

402
00:29:02,846 --> 00:29:04,848
I'm going to kill you.

403
00:29:06,316 --> 00:29:08,318
I know you want to, dear Orin,

404
00:29:10,053 --> 00:29:12,420
but your muscles are getting weak,

405
00:29:12,422 --> 00:29:17,194
your breath is slowing
and you're losing blood,

406
00:29:18,862 --> 00:29:20,564
that sweet Fusionite blood.

407
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:26,470
Give me the pleasure of feasting on you.

408
00:29:28,805 --> 00:29:29,640
Let go!

409
00:29:32,009 --> 00:29:34,511
[tense music]

410
00:29:49,292 --> 00:29:51,161
[blows thudding]

411
00:29:51,261 --> 00:29:52,863
Concede, to, me!

412
00:29:56,066 --> 00:29:57,734
Let, me, in!

413
00:30:33,570 --> 00:30:36,039
[Rinshi] Don't die on us yet young man.

414
00:30:40,277 --> 00:30:42,477
Grab my arm and fuse.

415
00:30:42,479 --> 00:30:43,980
Please, help me.

416
00:30:45,515 --> 00:30:48,785
I am, boy, grab my arm and fuse, now.

417
00:30:52,556 --> 00:30:53,990
[dramatic music]

418
00:30:55,659 --> 00:30:57,928
Roh-Lor-Hi-Eingod.

419
00:31:07,304 --> 00:31:10,140
[scavenger roars]

420
00:31:15,445 --> 00:31:16,578
[blows thudding]

421
00:31:16,580 --> 00:31:18,181
Concede, to, me!

422
00:31:26,990 --> 00:31:30,894
BILISH-TICGOR-ROE-RAYTHUM!

423
00:31:50,614 --> 00:31:54,518
[speaks in a foreign language]

424
00:31:56,420 --> 00:31:59,356
They can regenerate any part
of their body like a lizard.

425
00:32:00,724 --> 00:32:04,027
They're hard to kill, but
you did it, though, good job.

426
00:32:05,061 --> 00:32:05,896
You got a light?

427
00:32:06,763 --> 00:32:07,597
Who are you?

428
00:32:09,332 --> 00:32:10,467
Where are my manners?

429
00:32:12,068 --> 00:32:14,404
My name is Captain Rinshi Su Cora,

430
00:32:15,405 --> 00:32:17,707
a Croathian from the City of Kyzin.

431
00:32:18,542 --> 00:32:20,308
But you can call me Rinny.

432
00:32:20,310 --> 00:32:22,612
Okay, why didn't you help me?

433
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:25,380
I thought I did.

434
00:32:25,382 --> 00:32:28,683
Yeah, you could've killed her yourself.

435
00:32:28,685 --> 00:32:32,789
With these powers, why didn't you?

436
00:32:34,324 --> 00:32:38,026
I needed to know if
you are, who I thought you were.

437
00:32:38,028 --> 00:32:39,794
What are you talking about?

438
00:32:39,796 --> 00:32:42,866
It's an honor to meet
you, Mr. Orin TiRosch,

439
00:32:43,733 --> 00:32:47,068
Son of the famous Fusionite
scientist, Braythin

440
00:32:47,070 --> 00:32:49,873
and Angelamare
TiRosch... yes?...

441
00:32:50,874 --> 00:32:52,507
How do you know about my parents?

442
00:32:52,509 --> 00:32:54,275
How do you know about me?

443
00:32:54,277 --> 00:32:56,044
I don't know you!

444
00:32:56,046 --> 00:32:59,249
I should just kill you right
here with your own powers.

445
00:33:00,350 --> 00:33:01,950
You may,

446
00:33:01,952 --> 00:33:03,585
but we both know my counter moves

447
00:33:03,587 --> 00:33:05,253
and the fight will take far too long

448
00:33:05,255 --> 00:33:07,322
to be worth the time we don't have.

449
00:33:07,324 --> 00:33:08,723
Who are you?

450
00:33:08,725 --> 00:33:09,693
Answer me!

451
00:33:11,027 --> 00:33:14,064
I'll tell you, but can I
please have my throat back?

452
00:33:20,737 --> 00:33:21,571
Thank you, sir.

453
00:33:22,472 --> 00:33:24,138
As I mentioned before,

454
00:33:24,140 --> 00:33:27,277
I am Captain Rinshi Su Cora
from the City of Kyzin

455
00:33:28,278 --> 00:33:29,377
and an ambassador

456
00:33:29,379 --> 00:33:31,980
for the very group you're
forced to look for.

457
00:33:31,982 --> 00:33:33,414
The Resistance?

458
00:33:33,416 --> 00:33:34,482
Yes.

459
00:33:34,484 --> 00:33:36,050
How do you know?

460
00:33:36,052 --> 00:33:39,220
It's hard not to, when "The
Daughter of Demons" herself

461
00:33:39,222 --> 00:33:40,822
recruits a new scout.

462
00:33:40,824 --> 00:33:42,225
It wasn't my choice.

463
00:33:43,593 --> 00:33:45,293
I know, young TiRosch.

464
00:33:45,295 --> 00:33:46,561
I also know that your parents

465
00:33:46,563 --> 00:33:49,497
and Commander Hayden
were very good friends.

466
00:33:49,499 --> 00:33:50,698
I believe they assisted her

467
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:54,869
in rediscovering the ability
of bridging between worlds

468
00:33:54,871 --> 00:33:57,372
with use of the Stone of Essence.

469
00:33:57,374 --> 00:33:59,073
You know Commander Hayden?

470
00:33:59,075 --> 00:34:00,508
I do.

471
00:34:00,510 --> 00:34:02,045
I even knew her parents,

472
00:34:03,213 --> 00:34:07,448
Madielyyn and Sorkinston Hayden of
Murs,

473
00:34:07,450 --> 00:34:10,585
the most feared military
couple in the city.

474
00:34:10,587 --> 00:34:12,086
And they made sure their little girl

475
00:34:12,088 --> 00:34:13,988
earned the same recognition.

476
00:34:13,990 --> 00:34:15,823
Do you know where she is?

477
00:34:15,825 --> 00:34:17,725
Doing what she was meant to do,

478
00:34:17,727 --> 00:34:20,228
holding her pledge as
the keeper of the stone

479
00:34:20,230 --> 00:34:22,297
and searching for the Royal 4.

480
00:34:22,299 --> 00:34:23,831
The Royal 4?

481
00:34:23,833 --> 00:34:25,633
The myth about the 3 Kings and Queen

482
00:34:25,635 --> 00:34:27,635
who defeated an evil warlock named Yahzeel

483
00:34:27,637 --> 00:34:29,370
over 2000 years ago?

484
00:34:29,372 --> 00:34:31,105
That Royal 4?

485
00:34:31,107 --> 00:34:33,843
That is a mouthful,
but yes, that Royal 4.

486
00:34:34,878 --> 00:34:37,814
And I assure you, they are quite real.

487
00:34:38,782 --> 00:34:41,849
And they are presently living
in their reincarnated bodies

488
00:34:41,851 --> 00:34:43,086
that Sofia must find.

489
00:34:45,789 --> 00:34:48,289
When I was little, my
mother used to tell me

490
00:34:48,291 --> 00:34:50,124
about how the Royal 4
would be needed again,

491
00:34:50,126 --> 00:34:52,193
to defeat a great evil.

492
00:34:52,195 --> 00:34:56,264
But I always just thought it was a story

493
00:34:56,266 --> 00:34:57,400
to make me go to bed.

494
00:34:58,234 --> 00:35:00,403
I never thought it
would be something real,

495
00:35:01,338 --> 00:35:04,708
or if it was, it would
ever be in my lifetime.

496
00:35:05,775 --> 00:35:07,508
Your mother knew something was coming

497
00:35:07,510 --> 00:35:08,645
and wanted you to know.

498
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:11,713
Come on, we need to go.

499
00:35:11,715 --> 00:35:13,715
Let's go see your brother.

500
00:35:13,717 --> 00:35:15,285
What did you say?

501
00:35:16,319 --> 00:35:17,852
My brother's dead.

502
00:35:17,854 --> 00:35:19,687
No, Orin, he is alive.

503
00:35:19,689 --> 00:35:21,189
Your brother survived.

504
00:35:21,191 --> 00:35:23,458
What kinda shit are
you trying to pull, Rinny?

505
00:35:23,460 --> 00:35:25,495
I saw him die myself during the invasion.

506
00:35:26,463 --> 00:35:29,797
What you saw was him
getting injured, not dying.

507
00:35:29,799 --> 00:35:30,634
What?

508
00:35:33,236 --> 00:35:36,838
We found him after the
invasion, barely breathing.

509
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:39,240
Look Orin, I know this is
a lot to take all at once,

510
00:35:39,242 --> 00:35:42,710
but I promise to explain more later.

511
00:35:42,712 --> 00:35:46,481
We gotta get out of here now
before more scavengers arrive.

512
00:35:46,483 --> 00:35:50,518
Wait, wait, this isn't making any sense.

513
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:52,520
I understand, but we need to go now,

514
00:35:52,522 --> 00:35:55,223
unless you want to fight another scavenger.

515
00:35:55,225 --> 00:35:57,692
Wait, so if what you're saying's true,

516
00:35:57,694 --> 00:35:59,462
tell me something about my brother.

517
00:36:01,865 --> 00:36:04,132
Your brother talks too damn much.

518
00:36:04,134 --> 00:36:06,636
He's consistently yapping
about all kinds of shit.

519
00:36:07,837 --> 00:36:09,139
The boy drives me crazy.

520
00:36:11,041 --> 00:36:12,976
Yeah, he does talk a lot.

521
00:36:35,565 --> 00:36:37,400
Ba-La-Ry-Ba-La-Tok,

522
00:36:37,767 --> 00:36:40,503
Myne, Kyne, Toh, Cross!

523
00:36:42,138 --> 00:36:44,138
[mystical crackling]

524
00:36:44,140 --> 00:36:46,876
[echoing voices]

525
00:36:48,111 --> 00:36:49,677
Are you ready?

526
00:36:49,679 --> 00:36:50,713
What is this?

527
00:36:52,615 --> 00:36:55,685
Welcome to the Resistance, Young TiRosch.

528
00:37:06,863 --> 00:37:08,031
Right there.

529
00:37:09,532 --> 00:37:11,032
Where's Sofia?

530
00:37:11,034 --> 00:37:13,236
Upstairs, keeping an eye on things.

531
00:37:14,370 --> 00:37:15,171
Ah.

532
00:37:20,243 --> 00:37:21,311
That's about right.

533
00:37:22,245 --> 00:37:23,146
Damn, I'm good.

534
00:37:27,117 --> 00:37:28,349
So, sire?

535
00:37:28,351 --> 00:37:30,051
What do you think?

536
00:37:30,053 --> 00:37:33,721
Well done, Chip, well done.

537
00:37:33,723 --> 00:37:36,324
You have some great
skills with this device.

538
00:37:36,326 --> 00:37:37,558
I feel like a new man.

539
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:40,361
Well, sire, you kinda already are.

540
00:37:40,363 --> 00:37:41,696
Yeah, good point.

541
00:37:41,698 --> 00:37:43,397
Did you learn this skill on your own?

542
00:37:43,399 --> 00:37:44,232
I did.

543
00:37:44,234 --> 00:37:45,066
You know, when you're an orphan,

544
00:37:45,068 --> 00:37:47,203
you learn to pick up a
thing or two on your own.

545
00:37:48,171 --> 00:37:49,737
Guess you would have to.

546
00:37:49,739 --> 00:37:51,405
[Chip] Yeah, you do.

547
00:37:51,407 --> 00:37:54,144
So tell me, what is your name?

548
00:37:55,178 --> 00:37:56,177
What do you mean, sire?

549
00:37:56,179 --> 00:37:58,079
I mean, you know my name.

550
00:37:58,081 --> 00:37:58,915
But I don't.

551
00:38:00,383 --> 00:38:04,220
I noticed you were a Tyramglin
species, but who are you?

552
00:38:06,022 --> 00:38:08,789
[tense music]

553
00:38:08,791 --> 00:38:10,091
Oh no, no, no, no, sire.

554
00:38:10,093 --> 00:38:11,759
It's me, Chip, remember?

555
00:38:11,761 --> 00:38:13,227
Are you Eric right now, maybe you're Eric.

556
00:38:13,229 --> 00:38:16,631
Like, I'm Chip, you know
what, I'm gonna go get Sofia.

557
00:38:16,633 --> 00:38:18,699
She knows exactly what to
do, just give me one second.

558
00:38:18,701 --> 00:38:19,969
Chip, it's all right.

559
00:38:21,271 --> 00:38:24,539
It's all right, my memory's just fine.

560
00:38:24,541 --> 00:38:26,941
I was just asking about
your real name, that's all.

561
00:38:26,943 --> 00:38:28,843
Oh, thank god.

562
00:38:28,845 --> 00:38:31,612
I thought Eric was coming
back out for a second.

563
00:38:31,614 --> 00:38:35,550
I was just thinking,
Chip, Queen of Thieves,

564
00:38:35,552 --> 00:38:37,253
doesn't quite roll off the tongue.

565
00:38:38,154 --> 00:38:40,056
I sense there's something more to that.

566
00:38:41,124 --> 00:38:42,225
It doesn't, does it.

567
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:46,594
You know what, let me
properly introduce myself.

568
00:38:46,596 --> 00:38:50,965
My name is Mia Bello, Queen
of Thieves, at your service.

569
00:38:50,967 --> 00:38:54,437
Ah, Mia Bello, Queen of Thieves,

570
00:38:55,505 --> 00:38:56,973
now that sounds more like it.

571
00:38:57,874 --> 00:38:59,475
Pleasure to meet you Miss Bello.

572
00:39:00,510 --> 00:39:02,378
So where did the name Chip come from?

573
00:39:03,213 --> 00:39:07,415
Well, when I first met Tenan and Sofia

574
00:39:07,417 --> 00:39:10,084
I wasn't too pleasant or nor cooperative.

575
00:39:10,086 --> 00:39:11,452
I mean, why would I be?

576
00:39:11,454 --> 00:39:12,286
I just escaped

577
00:39:12,288 --> 00:39:15,489
one of the most horrific
experiences of my life,

578
00:39:15,491 --> 00:39:17,058
his killing campaigns.

579
00:39:17,060 --> 00:39:20,328
Everyone I knew was being taken,

580
00:39:20,330 --> 00:39:22,597
killed in front of my own eyes.

581
00:39:22,599 --> 00:39:26,234
That fucking monster
destroyed my everything.

582
00:39:26,236 --> 00:39:27,435
Sil.

583
00:39:27,437 --> 00:39:28,271
Yeah, him.

584
00:39:29,973 --> 00:39:33,808
Before all this I was the
Queen of the Underworld,

585
00:39:33,810 --> 00:39:36,412
the bitch everyone loved,
the bitch everyone feared.

586
00:39:37,247 --> 00:39:40,848
Hell, sire, I had princes

587
00:39:40,850 --> 00:39:43,684
and ambassadors offer me
things you can't even imagine

588
00:39:43,686 --> 00:39:45,388
just for one night with me.

589
00:39:47,590 --> 00:39:48,825
And then he came.

590
00:39:50,927 --> 00:39:51,928
And he took it all.

591
00:39:53,663 --> 00:39:54,697
And then I met Sofia.

592
00:39:56,299 --> 00:39:59,800
Well, she admired my
thieving skills and you know,

593
00:39:59,802 --> 00:40:01,504
my thirst to see Sil dead.

594
00:40:02,972 --> 00:40:05,039
You know what, one day she said to me,

595
00:40:05,041 --> 00:40:08,609
I like you, woman, you are survivor.

596
00:40:08,611 --> 00:40:11,381
You've got the fire in your
belly that burns so bright.

597
00:40:12,348 --> 00:40:13,881
And I like that.

598
00:40:13,883 --> 00:40:16,452
And you possess a strong
chip on your shoulder

599
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:19,720
And I see that you don't hide yours.

600
00:40:19,722 --> 00:40:22,325
So, I think I'm going to call you Chip.

601
00:40:23,726 --> 00:40:24,560
Sofia's right.

602
00:40:25,962 --> 00:40:27,397
That edge, that chip,

603
00:40:28,298 --> 00:40:29,932
something you never want to lose.

604
00:40:31,134 --> 00:40:33,601
Well, sire, it's something
that's always been there

605
00:40:33,603 --> 00:40:35,036
and it always will be.

606
00:40:35,038 --> 00:40:36,940
Yes, I can see that.

607
00:40:38,942 --> 00:40:40,043
You know, Chip,

608
00:40:41,644 --> 00:40:44,378
I want you guys to understand

609
00:40:44,380 --> 00:40:48,182
that when I had Lord Yowan, Lord Gato,

610
00:40:48,184 --> 00:40:50,887
Queen Ki and myself cast
our essence into the stone,

611
00:40:51,754 --> 00:40:55,289
it was my intention is to
have our artforms die with us,

612
00:40:55,291 --> 00:40:57,927
never allowing it a chance
to be used for evil again.

613
00:40:58,795 --> 00:41:00,828
[Chip] Well, shit happens, sire.

614
00:41:00,830 --> 00:41:01,664
Yeah.

615
00:41:02,565 --> 00:41:03,397
Well, these dark days

616
00:41:03,399 --> 00:41:05,435
were supposed to have ended with Yahzeel.

617
00:41:07,236 --> 00:41:10,104
What I can't seem to understand

618
00:41:10,106 --> 00:41:12,642
is why would Mother allow
a devil to be born again?

619
00:41:14,444 --> 00:41:16,145
Did we miss something so long ago?

620
00:41:18,715 --> 00:41:20,149
It's not your fault, sire.

621
00:41:21,217 --> 00:41:26,222
I mean, Mother can be an
unpredictable bitch at times,

622
00:41:26,556 --> 00:41:29,225
but if you look on the bright side,

623
00:41:30,293 --> 00:41:33,663
the Royal 4 is back,
they're here to save us all,

624
00:41:34,564 --> 00:41:37,433
and you're not some fairytale.

625
00:41:39,769 --> 00:41:41,469
[Zahyian] What was that?

626
00:41:41,471 --> 00:41:42,905
Oh, Sofia didn't tell you?

627
00:41:43,873 --> 00:41:48,409
Well, species down here
tells it as a literary fable,

628
00:41:48,411 --> 00:41:50,344
that they tell the kids if they're bad

629
00:41:50,346 --> 00:41:51,712
the Royal 4 will come back

630
00:41:51,714 --> 00:41:53,214
and bury them in The Forest of SiKoran.

631
00:41:53,216 --> 00:41:54,548
That is preposterous.

632
00:41:54,550 --> 00:41:56,617
We, we do not murder children.

633
00:41:56,619 --> 00:41:58,419
We are Ressear's protectors.

634
00:41:58,421 --> 00:42:00,388
We are not monsters.

635
00:42:00,390 --> 00:42:02,456
I know that now, but sire,

636
00:42:02,458 --> 00:42:05,659
a story that as old as you
are kinda had a way of-

637
00:42:05,661 --> 00:42:07,028
[Zahyian barks]

638
00:42:07,030 --> 00:42:09,497
No, that's outrageous.

639
00:42:09,499 --> 00:42:11,165
I know, right?

640
00:42:11,167 --> 00:42:11,999
[Sofia] Chip!

641
00:42:12,001 --> 00:42:13,034
Yeah?

642
00:42:13,036 --> 00:42:15,236
[Sofia] Have you done his sire's hair?

643
00:42:15,238 --> 00:42:16,437
Yeah?

644
00:42:16,439 --> 00:42:18,305
[Sofia] It's your turn to come up here.

645
00:42:18,307 --> 00:42:19,876
Yeah, coming.

646
00:42:26,182 --> 00:42:28,017
Really, a fairy tale?

647
00:42:28,985 --> 00:42:30,486
Well, not anymore, sire.

648
00:42:45,368 --> 00:42:48,037
[phone ringing]

649
00:42:51,541 --> 00:42:53,474
Reagor, do you have the king?

650
00:42:53,476 --> 00:42:56,944
[Reagor] No, looks like
a bomb hit this place.

651
00:42:56,946 --> 00:42:57,980
Do you want me to-

652
00:43:03,085 --> 00:43:05,655
[somber music]

653
00:43:12,428 --> 00:43:13,327
Hey, sire.

654
00:43:13,329 --> 00:43:14,962
How you feeling?

655
00:43:14,964 --> 00:43:16,265
A little taken back.

656
00:43:17,166 --> 00:43:18,801
Is it true we're a scary story?

657
00:43:20,369 --> 00:43:22,036
Chip told you, huh?

658
00:43:22,038 --> 00:43:23,571
Yes.

659
00:43:23,573 --> 00:43:26,275
This is why I told you
about Akinnis in the theater,

660
00:43:27,577 --> 00:43:28,411
do you remember?

661
00:43:29,779 --> 00:43:31,180
You were Eric at the time?

662
00:43:32,315 --> 00:43:34,417
I think so, it was a little foggy,

663
00:43:35,318 --> 00:43:36,450
but I believe you stated

664
00:43:36,452 --> 00:43:39,019
that he was the only one who
believed in me at the time.

665
00:43:39,021 --> 00:43:43,626
Yes, including a few
of us who knew the truth.

666
00:43:45,261 --> 00:43:47,130
Thank you, but why did you?

667
00:43:49,432 --> 00:43:51,932
I'll explain everything to you later.

668
00:43:51,934 --> 00:43:54,034
Right now we need to
begin to gather provision

669
00:43:54,036 --> 00:43:57,404
and prepare for base camp
as we sail down this river.

670
00:43:57,406 --> 00:43:58,239
Fine,

671
00:43:58,241 --> 00:44:01,275
but I expect to be briefed
on everything once we arrive.

672
00:44:01,277 --> 00:44:04,380
Of course, sire, Mother's my witness.

673
00:44:06,315 --> 00:44:08,115
Where are the clothes I got for you?

674
00:44:08,117 --> 00:44:09,550
What clothes?

675
00:44:09,552 --> 00:44:13,020
The clothes that Chip was
supposed to have given to you.

676
00:44:13,022 --> 00:44:15,155
She didn't give me anything.

677
00:44:15,157 --> 00:44:17,894
Oh, geez, that girl with men.

678
00:44:23,666 --> 00:44:24,798
Here, sire.

679
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:26,867
Thank you, Commander.

680
00:44:26,869 --> 00:44:29,338
[tense music]

681
00:44:30,773 --> 00:44:34,410
[sound of a slowing heartbeat]

682
00:45:28,831 --> 00:45:31,801
Istaaa-Gon-Rorrr.

683
00:47:00,222 --> 00:47:03,392
[slow, chiming music]

684
00:50:06,642 --> 00:50:09,409
Well, you've done more
than enough today, Sofia.

685
00:50:09,411 --> 00:50:12,713
Why don't you get some rest and wash up

686
00:50:12,715 --> 00:50:14,882
and I'll do some catching
up with these guys

687
00:50:14,884 --> 00:50:15,716
in the meantime.

688
00:50:15,718 --> 00:50:18,521
That's a good idea, thank you.

689
00:50:19,855 --> 00:50:23,190
Now, try not to get in
trouble while I'm gone.

690
00:50:23,192 --> 00:50:25,194
I'm a king, it's what I do.

691
00:50:27,263 --> 00:50:28,764
Sofia, quick question,

692
00:50:30,165 --> 00:50:32,432
where did you find The Stone of Essence?

693
00:50:32,434 --> 00:50:34,169
I'm a woman, that's what we do.

694
00:50:39,074 --> 00:50:41,975
How the fuck can Tenan
Fy still be alive, Cayla?

695
00:50:41,977 --> 00:50:44,680
I thought you killed everyone
in Murs, especially him.

696
00:50:46,081 --> 00:50:48,782
It happens, IL-Roserious,

697
00:50:48,784 --> 00:50:53,186
some slipped out, some
died on the way out,

698
00:50:53,188 --> 00:50:55,257
in the end they all die by our hand

699
00:50:57,026 --> 00:50:58,861
or serve Sil of course.

700
00:51:00,195 --> 00:51:01,228
Cayla.

701
00:51:01,230 --> 00:51:06,135
Rah, baby, please, it's been a long day.

702
00:51:07,169 --> 00:51:09,870
Why don't you join me, huh?

703
00:51:09,872 --> 00:51:11,373
Relax a little.

704
00:51:16,312 --> 00:51:19,248
Fine, have some wine.

705
00:51:20,115 --> 00:51:21,150
No, Cayla.

706
00:51:26,188 --> 00:51:29,690
This is Tenan Fy, Cayla, not just

707
00:51:29,692 --> 00:51:32,826
some headstrong Croathian
you can simply manipulate.

708
00:51:32,828 --> 00:51:35,462
He's a prodigy, like me.

709
00:51:35,464 --> 00:51:38,498
He's a legend for what he
did amongst his species

710
00:51:38,500 --> 00:51:41,802
during the Murs invasion, your invasion.

711
00:51:41,804 --> 00:51:45,439
I know, he killed a lot all by-

712
00:51:45,441 --> 00:51:47,142
- Two hundred, Cayla.

713
00:51:48,210 --> 00:51:51,845
200 of your men by himself.

714
00:51:51,847 --> 00:51:53,082
I was there

715
00:51:54,016 --> 00:51:55,250
and Murs still fell.

716
00:51:56,251 --> 00:51:57,753
And this doesn't bother you?

717
00:51:58,654 --> 00:51:59,953
Really?

718
00:51:59,955 --> 00:52:03,056
Can't you see, if other
Croathians find out

719
00:52:03,058 --> 00:52:04,758
that their leader is still alive?

720
00:52:04,760 --> 00:52:07,561
That he still fights for them?

721
00:52:07,563 --> 00:52:09,863
This can cause problems in the Alliance.

722
00:52:09,865 --> 00:52:12,566
And on top of that, my Quensentian army

723
00:52:12,568 --> 00:52:15,068
consists of hundreds of
these headstrong brutes

724
00:52:15,070 --> 00:52:18,605
and I do not need to start
killing off pieces of my own.

725
00:52:18,607 --> 00:52:20,776
If so, so what, Rah?

726
00:52:21,844 --> 00:52:22,876
There's plenty of species

727
00:52:22,878 --> 00:52:25,180
that want to be part of
your Quensentian Order

728
00:52:26,048 --> 00:52:29,351
and wear those sexy-ass outfits.

729
00:52:30,319 --> 00:52:33,620
Yeah, well, I need a
certain amount of Croathians

730
00:52:33,622 --> 00:52:35,956
in my Order to maintain balance.

731
00:52:35,958 --> 00:52:37,524
I know.

732
00:52:37,526 --> 00:52:39,995
We have to be smart
about things and reset.

733
00:52:40,963 --> 00:52:43,664
We still have an ancient king to find,

734
00:52:43,666 --> 00:52:46,466
cities to prep for Yahzeel's return,

735
00:52:46,468 --> 00:52:48,971
and a Resistance to kill.

736
00:52:50,272 --> 00:52:53,909
So, c'mon, take off those
wet clothes and relax.

737
00:52:56,145 --> 00:52:59,212
I am just concerned
about SWA finding out

738
00:52:59,214 --> 00:53:01,348
that Tenan is still alive.

739
00:53:01,350 --> 00:53:03,784
You know, Lieutenant Kytan
is a Croathian himself,

740
00:53:03,786 --> 00:53:06,653
and he still holds reverence for him.

741
00:53:06,655 --> 00:53:08,355
Yeah, that's rich,

742
00:53:08,357 --> 00:53:11,060
he's the one that led most
of them to their slaughter.

743
00:53:13,962 --> 00:53:15,197
Baby, look,

744
00:53:16,832 --> 00:53:20,202
soon the Supreme World Alliance
will be a thing of the past.

745
00:53:21,203 --> 00:53:25,841
And once Sil finds Yahzeel,
our powers will be endless,

746
00:53:26,909 --> 00:53:29,443
our cities countless,

747
00:53:29,445 --> 00:53:33,582
and best of all, we will
be queens of everything.

748
00:53:36,518 --> 00:53:40,120
You know that I am yours and you are mine,

749
00:53:40,122 --> 00:53:41,190
we are his.

750
00:53:42,224 --> 00:53:44,157
Together we are shaping Ressear

751
00:53:44,159 --> 00:53:46,562
into a new world just for us.

752
00:53:47,596 --> 00:53:49,362
So fuck Tenan.

753
00:53:49,364 --> 00:53:51,198
Fuck 'em all.

754
00:53:51,200 --> 00:53:53,068
They'll be dead soon anyways.

755
00:53:56,472 --> 00:53:57,539
You're right, baby.

756
00:53:58,607 --> 00:53:59,441
I know I am.

757
00:54:00,943 --> 00:54:05,011
So come on, have the
servants take care of you.

758
00:54:05,013 --> 00:54:06,882
Take off those wet clothes.

759
00:54:07,750 --> 00:54:09,249
Not right now.

760
00:54:09,251 --> 00:54:10,450
I'm planning on meeting up

761
00:54:10,452 --> 00:54:11,918
with some of my top Quensentian soldiers

762
00:54:11,920 --> 00:54:16,156
tonight after Sil's
meeting to begin a search.

763
00:54:16,158 --> 00:54:18,258
You're relentless, Rah,

764
00:54:18,260 --> 00:54:19,728
that's what I love about you.

765
00:54:21,230 --> 00:54:23,330
Can I bring some of my soldiers too?

766
00:54:23,332 --> 00:54:24,831
Please do.

767
00:54:24,833 --> 00:54:26,933
I can't wait to see you
get your second shot

768
00:54:26,935 --> 00:54:28,401
at my former leader.

769
00:54:28,403 --> 00:54:29,505
Former leader?

770
00:54:30,706 --> 00:54:32,105
You know, Sofia?

771
00:54:32,107 --> 00:54:34,141
Of course, she was my commander

772
00:54:34,143 --> 00:54:36,843
when I was with the
Neptonian Special Forces,

773
00:54:36,845 --> 00:54:37,946
alongside Tenan.

774
00:54:39,014 --> 00:54:41,016
I didn't think she was
still alive, though.

775
00:54:43,819 --> 00:54:45,320
Why didn't you say anything?

776
00:54:47,956 --> 00:54:49,358
Why didn't she say anything?

777
00:54:51,260 --> 00:54:54,528
Sofia led several
divisions for many years

778
00:54:54,530 --> 00:54:56,296
so most of our orders

779
00:54:56,298 --> 00:54:58,798
were given to us secondhand
by our lieutenants.

780
00:54:58,800 --> 00:55:02,704
So she wouldn't know what
most of us look like anyway.

781
00:55:04,006 --> 00:55:05,874
She must've heard you though

782
00:55:06,108 --> 00:55:08,575
since you had a bounty
on your head for treason.

783
00:55:08,577 --> 00:55:10,510
Yeah, still do.

784
00:55:10,512 --> 00:55:13,713
But I doubt she even cared
anyway because that time,

785
00:55:13,715 --> 00:55:16,116
that was the beginning of Sil's invasions.

786
00:55:16,118 --> 00:55:19,452
So I was the least of her problems.

787
00:55:19,454 --> 00:55:21,590
But you could have
told me at some point.

788
00:55:23,058 --> 00:55:24,357
Yeah, I know,

789
00:55:24,359 --> 00:55:26,092
but I didn't want to give
away our new advantage.

790
00:55:26,094 --> 00:55:29,563
Besides, best she didn't know that I know.

791
00:55:29,565 --> 00:55:32,766
Well, I know she ran into the
southern part of the forest.

792
00:55:32,768 --> 00:55:35,502
That's where I sent SK10 to look for them.

793
00:55:35,504 --> 00:55:37,270
Oh, do you have a team following them?

794
00:55:37,272 --> 00:55:38,438
Good.

795
00:55:38,440 --> 00:55:40,207
Not anymore.

796
00:55:40,209 --> 00:55:42,711
Reagor informed me that
they were all slaughtered.

797
00:55:43,612 --> 00:55:45,581
Looks like the area got hit by a bomb.

798
00:55:47,082 --> 00:55:49,649
Looks like the king has been realized.

799
00:55:49,651 --> 00:55:50,485
Shit.

800
00:55:56,058 --> 00:55:57,059
The Ziltion River.

801
00:55:58,627 --> 00:56:00,927
That river leads to
that area of the forest

802
00:56:00,929 --> 00:56:03,997
and I know Sofia likes to travel by water,

803
00:56:03,999 --> 00:56:05,498
especially at night.

804
00:56:05,500 --> 00:56:06,833
Why is that?

805
00:56:06,835 --> 00:56:09,204
Her artform is stronger near water.

806
00:56:12,174 --> 00:56:14,774
You know, that river leads

807
00:56:14,776 --> 00:56:17,112
towards the site of Sil's first invasion.

808
00:56:18,080 --> 00:56:20,914
You think she'll show
using it as a hideout?

809
00:56:20,916 --> 00:56:22,249
I would.

810
00:56:22,251 --> 00:56:24,818
That place is like a blood filled tomb,

811
00:56:24,820 --> 00:56:26,353
no one would be able to stomach it

812
00:56:26,355 --> 00:56:29,625
for a long period of
time, except for Sofia.

813
00:56:31,727 --> 00:56:34,196
You are so fucking badass.

814
00:56:39,801 --> 00:56:40,869
Get me a phone!

815
00:56:47,609 --> 00:56:48,975
Lieutenant Kryst,

816
00:56:48,977 --> 00:56:52,178
have Killing Squad 3 search
south of The Ziltion River

817
00:56:52,180 --> 00:56:54,549
for a boat carrying
members of the Resistance.

818
00:56:55,918 --> 00:56:57,450
No,

819
00:56:57,452 --> 00:56:58,787
bring them all back alive.

820
00:57:00,188 --> 00:57:01,256
In any condition.

821
00:57:02,257 --> 00:57:03,892
No, now, Lieutenant.

822
00:57:07,362 --> 00:57:08,830
I need to give her a visit.

823
00:57:09,831 --> 00:57:12,467
I guess my search for Tenan may be over.

824
00:57:14,169 --> 00:57:15,370
Maybe.

825
00:57:16,471 --> 00:57:19,439
Soon Sil will have the King's head

826
00:57:19,441 --> 00:57:21,810
and I will have Sofia's
corpse on my plate.

827
00:57:22,844 --> 00:57:25,013
So Commander Hayden is the King's guard.

828
00:57:26,581 --> 00:57:27,414
[Together] My love.

829
00:57:27,416 --> 00:57:30,617
This explains why I could
only see the King and not her.

830
00:57:30,619 --> 00:57:32,519
[IL-Roserious] You know Sofia?

831
00:57:32,521 --> 00:57:34,621
We were once closely aligned

832
00:57:34,623 --> 00:57:36,525
in a time nearly forgotten.

833
00:57:38,560 --> 00:57:39,559
It seemed, however,

834
00:57:39,561 --> 00:57:41,630
that she would rather hold her pledge to,

835
00:57:43,832 --> 00:57:47,000
you know, the Neptonian order.

836
00:57:47,002 --> 00:57:49,037
What is important is who she is guarding,

837
00:57:50,138 --> 00:57:52,005
Lord Zahyian Crehin.

838
00:57:52,007 --> 00:57:53,807
You can see who it is now?

839
00:57:53,809 --> 00:57:54,643
Oh, yes.

840
00:57:55,544 --> 00:57:56,843
SiKoran's essence is strong,

841
00:57:56,845 --> 00:58:00,513
it allows me to see and
feel things once obscured.

842
00:58:00,515 --> 00:58:03,550
I can feel his realization
growing in strength.

843
00:58:03,552 --> 00:58:05,585
Can you pinpoint his location?

844
00:58:05,587 --> 00:58:06,419
Not clearly.

845
00:58:06,421 --> 00:58:09,222
The cloaking chant Sofia
has surrounding herself

846
00:58:09,224 --> 00:58:11,257
is stronger than I remember.

847
00:58:11,259 --> 00:58:13,660
Well, we may have
found out where she is.

848
00:58:13,662 --> 00:58:17,530
I just sent KS3 south
of the Zilshin River.

849
00:58:17,532 --> 00:58:19,032
We believe Sofia may be headed

850
00:58:19,034 --> 00:58:21,501
towards the site of your first invasion

851
00:58:21,503 --> 00:58:23,837
to lay low because it's abandoned.

852
00:58:23,839 --> 00:58:25,107
True to her character.

853
00:58:26,074 --> 00:58:27,974
I'm curious, my love,

854
00:58:27,976 --> 00:58:30,076
why couldn't you see Sofia before?

855
00:58:30,078 --> 00:58:34,282
Sofia is strong in the
ancient arts, a true student,

856
00:58:35,550 --> 00:58:36,883
but no one is strong enough

857
00:58:36,885 --> 00:58:39,686
to fully conceal a King's essence,

858
00:58:39,688 --> 00:58:43,923
especially one like Zahyian Crehin.

859
00:58:43,925 --> 00:58:45,325
[Cayla] You admire her.

860
00:58:45,327 --> 00:58:46,928
Not enough to spare her life.

861
00:58:50,432 --> 00:58:52,834
I see you two have had
an intimate encounter.

862
00:58:53,702 --> 00:58:57,303
I was blindsided by
Tenan and Sofia is all,

863
00:58:57,305 --> 00:58:58,571
it's nothing.

864
00:58:58,573 --> 00:59:00,142
Tenan Fy is alive?

865
00:59:01,710 --> 00:59:03,877
And Mia Bello.

866
00:59:03,879 --> 00:59:05,512
The Queen of Thieves?

867
00:59:05,514 --> 00:59:08,314
She's the one who hit me
when I was up against the tree.

868
00:59:08,316 --> 00:59:09,851
She must have blindsided you.

869
00:59:10,786 --> 00:59:12,454
Mia is alive as well.

870
00:59:12,854 --> 00:59:14,654
[Cayla] That fucking
subterranean rodent.

871
00:59:14,656 --> 00:59:16,089
If you're right about where they are,

872
00:59:16,091 --> 00:59:18,992
KS3 should have no
trouble securing the King.

873
00:59:18,994 --> 00:59:21,728
His abilities are not
at full strength yet.

874
00:59:21,730 --> 00:59:24,264
In the meantime we need
to prepare for tonight.

875
00:59:24,266 --> 00:59:26,368
Our time of sovereignty is upon us.

876
00:59:27,335 --> 00:59:29,271
[Cayla] What's the urgency
for tonight's meeting?

877
00:59:30,372 --> 00:59:34,307
Wait, you found him, didn't you?

878
00:59:34,309 --> 00:59:35,310
Didn't you, my love?

879
00:59:36,511 --> 00:59:37,612
You found Yahzeel.

880
00:59:38,880 --> 00:59:39,748
Is that true?

881
00:59:41,316 --> 00:59:42,849
Maybe we should cancel tonight's meeting

882
00:59:42,851 --> 00:59:44,150
and begin the ritual to-

883
00:59:44,152 --> 00:59:45,153
- Be still, Cayla.

884
00:59:46,121 --> 00:59:47,789
We are carrying on as planned.

885
00:59:49,558 --> 00:59:50,757
Tonight's meeting must take place

886
00:59:50,759 --> 00:59:52,561
in order for us to take ours.

887
00:59:53,995 --> 00:59:55,628
And to answer your other question,

888
00:59:55,630 --> 00:59:58,598
Vowlen discovered his tomb not
far from where we were today

889
00:59:58,600 --> 01:00:00,099
in Sikoran.

890
01:00:00,101 --> 01:00:00,936
Sikoran?

891
01:00:01,870 --> 01:00:03,470
He's buried in Sikoran?

892
01:00:03,472 --> 01:00:04,938
He is.

893
01:00:04,940 --> 01:00:07,740
You knew he was buried
there this whole time.

894
01:00:07,742 --> 01:00:09,142
Why didn't you let us know?

895
01:00:09,144 --> 01:00:11,110
Because I needed you two to focus on

896
01:00:11,112 --> 01:00:13,613
finding the King and killing him

897
01:00:13,615 --> 01:00:16,017
so that we wouldn't be facing
the problem we have now.

898
01:00:16,952 --> 01:00:20,253
Vowlan contacted me while
I was on my way to you,

899
01:00:20,255 --> 01:00:22,188
informing me that Sikoran had awoken,

900
01:00:22,190 --> 01:00:25,158
unleashing the forest
native armies upon his camp.

901
01:00:25,160 --> 01:00:28,328
That is why I needed to tame that thing,

902
01:00:28,330 --> 01:00:30,296
so that we can begin
excavation on Yahzeel's tomb

903
01:00:30,298 --> 01:00:32,100
without any interference from him.

904
01:00:33,502 --> 01:00:34,934
I'm still amazed

905
01:00:34,936 --> 01:00:37,971
that you were able to tame
an Immortal Wonder, my love.

906
01:00:37,973 --> 01:00:40,139
The ancient artforms
are far more powerful

907
01:00:40,141 --> 01:00:42,575
than today's chants.

908
01:00:42,577 --> 01:00:45,814
My "Poison Flower", my "Daughter of Demons",

909
01:00:47,015 --> 01:00:48,550
our time has arrived.

910
01:00:49,985 --> 01:00:54,055
You've worked long and hard
for this day, haven't we?

911
01:00:55,490 --> 01:00:58,326
The day when we can finally
say Yahzeel has arrived.

912
01:01:00,395 --> 01:01:01,596
Doesn't that sound good?

913
01:01:04,833 --> 01:01:07,536
Yes, it does, doesn't it?

914
01:01:09,304 --> 01:01:12,305
Those weak minded,
pretentious, bloated children

915
01:01:12,307 --> 01:01:14,741
we call the Supreme World Alliance

916
01:01:14,743 --> 01:01:18,011
never believed in the
threat of the Royal 4,

917
01:01:18,013 --> 01:01:19,447
nor the legacy of Yahzeel,

918
01:01:21,583 --> 01:01:24,219
but we did, didn't we?

919
01:01:27,055 --> 01:01:27,889
Yes.

920
01:01:28,757 --> 01:01:30,757
And tonight they will know what feels like

921
01:01:30,759 --> 01:01:32,894
to be on the other side of your blades

922
01:01:33,962 --> 01:01:35,263
[Together] Yes, my love.

923
01:02:10,065 --> 01:02:12,567
[eerie music]

924
01:02:15,036 --> 01:02:18,707
I see there is still
magic in these walls.

925
01:02:34,923 --> 01:02:37,192
Where are you, Mr. Orin?

926
01:02:40,795 --> 01:02:42,897
You couldn't gone far without.

927
01:02:51,339 --> 01:02:53,775
I wonder, has he come across?

928
01:02:56,645 --> 01:02:59,481
[fabric rustling]

929
01:03:07,989 --> 01:03:09,224
[gasping] Thanks to Mother,

930
01:03:10,258 --> 01:03:12,925
someone has finally come to save me.

931
01:03:12,927 --> 01:03:16,798
Sir, I haven't eaten for so long

932
01:03:17,966 --> 01:03:18,867
and I'm so hungry.

933
01:03:20,368 --> 01:03:22,669
I've been hiding from Sil's goons for-

934
01:03:22,671 --> 01:03:25,573
[gunshots banging]

935
01:03:41,256 --> 01:03:43,992
[blows thudding]

936
01:03:47,962 --> 01:03:50,965
[fighters grunting]

937
01:03:53,034 --> 01:03:55,234
Concede, baby,

938
01:03:55,236 --> 01:03:57,038
I can feel you want me.

939
01:03:57,939 --> 01:04:01,276
I want you, but I need
you to relax, darling.

940
01:04:02,210 --> 01:04:05,580
I want the pleasure of
hearing your screams

941
01:04:06,614 --> 01:04:08,183
as I dine on your flesh.

942
01:04:12,020 --> 01:04:14,589
I really hate you

943
01:04:16,224 --> 01:04:17,792
Scavengers!

944
01:04:33,241 --> 01:04:35,508
You scavengers are fucking disgusting.

945
01:04:35,510 --> 01:04:37,312
Tell me, where is the the boy.

946
01:04:39,114 --> 01:04:41,681
There is none boy here.

947
01:04:41,683 --> 01:04:43,585
But I know you, Juken Erstinrue.

948
01:04:45,220 --> 01:04:46,986
Get out of my head.

949
01:04:46,988 --> 01:04:48,423
Stop reading my thoughts!

950
01:04:49,624 --> 01:04:51,290
Tell me, where is he?

951
01:04:51,292 --> 01:04:52,694
I know he was here.

952
01:04:53,595 --> 01:04:55,797
There is no one here but me, baby.

953
01:04:57,065 --> 01:05:00,433
Relax, concede to me,

954
01:05:00,435 --> 01:05:03,471
I promise I'm gonna eat you quick.

955
01:05:05,073 --> 01:05:07,409
Did you kill him, tell me!

956
01:05:09,744 --> 01:05:11,611
[man grunting]

957
01:05:11,613 --> 01:05:15,683
Leave him alone, I'm
not finished with him yet.

958
01:05:24,259 --> 01:05:25,093
A Guard

959
01:05:29,063 --> 01:05:30,865
Hey, don't move.

960
01:05:41,609 --> 01:05:44,045
Keep pressure on it, you know the drill.

961
01:05:45,013 --> 01:05:46,445
Thanks.

962
01:05:46,447 --> 01:05:47,382
What's your name?

963
01:05:49,851 --> 01:05:51,918
Kavyian Sho, yours?

964
01:05:51,920 --> 01:05:53,986
Juken Erstinrue.

965
01:05:53,988 --> 01:05:55,721
Who you assigned to?

966
01:05:55,723 --> 01:05:59,125
Lieutenant Kryst, a
Vampian from the west, you?

967
01:05:59,127 --> 01:06:00,295
Captain Tull,

968
01:06:01,296 --> 01:06:05,031
A Soul-Anger from the east, fucking coward.

969
01:06:05,033 --> 01:06:06,098
[Juken] Where is he?

970
01:06:06,100 --> 01:06:07,667
I don't know.

971
01:06:07,669 --> 01:06:11,504
He ran off when a group of
scavengers jumped us from behind.

972
01:06:11,506 --> 01:06:13,973
He wouldn't have gotten far.

973
01:06:13,975 --> 01:06:15,107
How is it you survived?

974
01:06:15,109 --> 01:06:17,712
Scavengers are not known
to keep anything alive.

975
01:06:18,546 --> 01:06:20,246
It didn't.

976
01:06:20,248 --> 01:06:21,414
The female was about to feed on me

977
01:06:21,416 --> 01:06:23,182
until she heard you come in.

978
01:06:23,184 --> 01:06:25,051
So, thanks.

979
01:06:25,053 --> 01:06:27,288
You don't have to
worry about her anymore.

980
01:06:28,690 --> 01:06:29,722
Let me ask you something,

981
01:06:29,724 --> 01:06:31,357
did you see a young guy come through here

982
01:06:31,359 --> 01:06:32,892
with a green sweater?

983
01:06:32,894 --> 01:06:34,126
No.

984
01:06:34,128 --> 01:06:35,494
What is he, your mark?

985
01:06:35,496 --> 01:06:36,331
Yeah.

986
01:06:38,199 --> 01:06:39,434
Can you get up?

987
01:06:40,368 --> 01:06:41,436
I think so.

988
01:06:50,378 --> 01:06:54,614
[Hooded Figure] Hey guys,
are you here to save me?

989
01:06:54,616 --> 01:06:57,049
I haven't eaten in days.

990
01:06:57,051 --> 01:07:00,455
Please help me, I'll do anything for you.

991
01:07:02,457 --> 01:07:04,090
Can you fight?

992
01:07:04,092 --> 01:07:05,827
Yes, I can fight.

993
01:07:07,795 --> 01:07:09,862
We know what you are, Scavenger.

994
01:07:09,864 --> 01:07:11,864
So why don't you go back into you hole

995
01:07:11,866 --> 01:07:13,968
or end up like your girlfriend over here?

996
01:07:18,106 --> 01:07:20,039
What format do you suggest?

997
01:07:20,041 --> 01:07:21,807
For this big bastard,

998
01:07:21,809 --> 01:07:24,479
let's do format 43, set 90.

999
01:07:25,513 --> 01:07:28,516
[scavenger roaring]

1000
01:07:31,719 --> 01:07:34,322
Let's change that, full 60, set 80.

1001
01:07:35,823 --> 01:07:37,390
Yeah, agree.

1002
01:07:37,392 --> 01:07:39,894
[tense music]

1003
01:07:47,769 --> 01:07:50,772
[fighters grunting]

1004
01:07:52,073 --> 01:07:54,809
[blows thudding]

1005
01:07:59,547 --> 01:08:02,550
[scavenger roaring]

1006
01:08:38,486 --> 01:08:40,722
Juken, we need to end this.

1007
01:08:42,857 --> 01:08:43,691
I know.

1008
01:08:49,631 --> 01:08:52,133
I need time to build my chant.

1009
01:09:01,909 --> 01:09:07,782
Bysaleen-Ro-Bythin-Ge-Ilstrin

1010
01:09:10,418 --> 01:09:12,453
Ahhh!

1011
01:09:28,403 --> 01:09:29,404
Die already.

1012
01:09:38,880 --> 01:09:39,714
I'll tell you,

1013
01:09:40,648 --> 01:09:42,848
these scavengers are getting
harder to kill nowadays.

1014
01:09:42,850 --> 01:09:43,951
Yeah, they are.

1015
01:09:45,319 --> 01:09:46,752
How you feeling?

1016
01:09:46,754 --> 01:09:48,020
Tired.

1017
01:09:48,022 --> 01:09:48,856
Me too.

1018
01:09:50,258 --> 01:09:53,059
This is not the kind of day I had in mind,

1019
01:09:53,061 --> 01:09:54,994
but thank you for helping me with this.

1020
01:09:54,996 --> 01:09:56,462
Well, you did

1021
01:09:56,464 --> 01:09:59,098
lure me away from the
female scavenger earlier.

1022
01:09:59,100 --> 01:10:01,169
Well, it worked out for the both of us.

1023
01:10:02,837 --> 01:10:04,972
Hey, stay still, relax.

1024
01:10:06,407 --> 01:10:07,973
Let me look around for something
to mend that wound of yours

1025
01:10:07,975 --> 01:10:10,545
so you can get out of here
and back to base, huh?

1026
01:10:11,679 --> 01:10:13,414
See if you can find some water too.

1027
01:10:35,803 --> 01:10:38,973
[atmosphere rumbling]

1028
01:10:42,043 --> 01:10:46,013
Well boy, it seems you
found the Resistance.

1029
01:10:55,356 --> 01:10:56,290
Hey, Croathian.

1030
01:10:58,359 --> 01:11:00,860
Hey, sire, feeling better?

1031
01:11:00,862 --> 01:11:02,428
Somewhat.

1032
01:11:02,430 --> 01:11:04,930
Though much has changed
since I've been away,

1033
01:11:04,932 --> 01:11:06,565
I've got much to catch up on,

1034
01:11:06,567 --> 01:11:08,903
otherwise, feeling more in control.

1035
01:11:09,971 --> 01:11:11,072
That's good to hear.

1036
01:11:12,073 --> 01:11:14,173
You know, I wanted to thank you

1037
01:11:14,175 --> 01:11:16,308
for what you did for me back there.

1038
01:11:16,310 --> 01:11:17,910
If you didn't arrive when you did,

1039
01:11:17,912 --> 01:11:19,814
those women would have surely killed me.

1040
01:11:20,982 --> 01:11:22,681
Of course, sire, it's my duty.

1041
01:11:22,683 --> 01:11:24,950
And I thank you for not
killing me back there

1042
01:11:24,952 --> 01:11:26,320
for treating you like shit.

1043
01:11:27,221 --> 01:11:29,688
It's all right,
Lieutenant, you didn't know.

1044
01:11:29,690 --> 01:11:31,025
Shit, I didn't know either.

1045
01:11:32,293 --> 01:11:34,727
You know, if it wasn't for Sofia,

1046
01:11:34,729 --> 01:11:36,729
I'd still be creating spreadsheets

1047
01:11:36,731 --> 01:11:39,000
and business plans while
my true world burns.

1048
01:11:40,735 --> 01:11:43,402
That's a good woman you
guys have there, Tenan,

1049
01:11:43,404 --> 01:11:45,905
and you're fortunate to
have her as your leader.

1050
01:11:45,907 --> 01:11:49,475
Yes, sire, we are, but
we all follow you now.

1051
01:11:49,477 --> 01:11:51,977
And I appreciate that Lieutenant,

1052
01:11:51,979 --> 01:11:53,946
but we are a team first

1053
01:11:53,948 --> 01:11:55,383
and we follow what is right.

1054
01:11:56,350 --> 01:12:00,021
What we must do now is bring
back balance to our Mother.

1055
01:12:01,155 --> 01:12:05,658
And I promise you,
Tenan, we will win this.

1056
01:12:05,660 --> 01:12:09,228
I will find Sil and all of his followers

1057
01:12:09,230 --> 01:12:11,030
and bathe in their screams

1058
01:12:11,032 --> 01:12:14,068
as I feel their bones crush
in the palm of my hands.

1059
01:12:15,169 --> 01:12:17,136
Do you hear me, brother?

1060
01:12:17,138 --> 01:12:18,204
Yes.

1061
01:12:18,206 --> 01:12:19,106
Blood for blood.

1062
01:12:20,141 --> 01:12:21,042
[Tenan] Blood for blood.

1063
01:12:23,211 --> 01:12:25,945
I see Croathians haven't
lost their thirst for battle.

1064
01:12:25,947 --> 01:12:28,516
No, sir, we haven't.

1065
01:12:30,618 --> 01:12:34,019
I've seen that look far
too many times, Lieutenant.

1066
01:12:34,021 --> 01:12:34,855
When did she die?

1067
01:12:36,123 --> 01:12:37,592
When did they die, sire.

1068
01:12:39,160 --> 01:12:40,761
It was two years from yesterday.

1069
01:12:42,730 --> 01:12:43,931
What were their names?

1070
01:12:45,833 --> 01:12:47,535
Tygan and Valada.

1071
01:12:48,402 --> 01:12:49,237
What happened?

1072
01:12:50,071 --> 01:12:51,806
When Sil's invasion began.

1073
01:12:52,840 --> 01:12:55,140
I hid my family beneath
the royal building,

1074
01:12:55,142 --> 01:12:56,544
in a room built for war.

1075
01:12:57,612 --> 01:13:00,779
It was designed to house
over a thousand beings

1076
01:13:00,781 --> 01:13:04,216
for up to a year, many
of Murs's top soldiers,

1077
01:13:04,218 --> 01:13:07,555
doctors, and communication
specialists to look over them.

1078
01:13:08,656 --> 01:13:09,957
I knew they were safe!

1079
01:13:10,891 --> 01:13:15,361
So me, Sofia, 80,000 of our soldiers

1080
01:13:15,363 --> 01:13:17,999
ran to the wall to face Sil's monsters.

1081
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:22,103
We were ready to show them what
it meant to battle an army of Murs.

1082
01:13:23,471 --> 01:13:25,740
After a few hours it
seemed as if we had won,

1083
01:13:26,841 --> 01:13:29,141
the field was filled with smoke,

1084
01:13:29,143 --> 01:13:30,878
the ground bled for miles.

1085
01:13:33,114 --> 01:13:34,348
Many of us still stood.

1086
01:13:36,851 --> 01:13:38,886
Then I hear Sofia yelling for me.

1087
01:13:39,787 --> 01:13:43,122
I turned to see the back of
the royal building in flames.

1088
01:13:43,124 --> 01:13:44,492
That is where the room was.

1089
01:13:45,826 --> 01:13:48,027
Me and Sofia ran as fast as we could,

1090
01:13:48,029 --> 01:13:51,196
over countless bodies of
our own people, to see.

1091
01:13:51,198 --> 01:13:54,667
Somehow Sil's monsters
had ripped the door apart.

1092
01:13:54,669 --> 01:13:56,869
We searched it, searched for survivors,

1093
01:13:56,871 --> 01:13:59,273
but all we saw were
bodies laying everywhere.

1094
01:14:01,275 --> 01:14:04,510
And there they were, my two babies,

1095
01:14:04,512 --> 01:14:07,581
huddled together, covered in ash.

1096
01:14:09,350 --> 01:14:11,350
I went over to touch them,

1097
01:14:11,352 --> 01:14:15,856
and as I did they just
fell apart, to dust.

1098
01:14:17,391 --> 01:14:18,357
Sil must've been using

1099
01:14:18,359 --> 01:14:21,095
an ancient artform you couldn't
have been prepared for.

1100
01:14:22,496 --> 01:14:24,131
You know, the scariest part is,

1101
01:14:25,166 --> 01:14:28,135
there are times that I cannot
remember what they look like.

1102
01:14:29,370 --> 01:14:31,470
What kind of husband and father am I

1103
01:14:31,472 --> 01:14:34,340
that I can forget what
they fucking looked like?

1104
01:14:34,342 --> 01:14:35,808
You will never forget, Tenan,

1105
01:14:35,810 --> 01:14:37,511
you will never forget.

1106
01:14:39,513 --> 01:14:42,550
They always live right
here and right here.

1107
01:14:43,718 --> 01:14:45,619
See them and feel them.

1108
01:14:47,455 --> 01:14:48,289
Let me show you.

1109
01:14:51,092 --> 01:14:55,096
Kom-Bu-Lay-Fay-Veezin-His-Love.

1110
01:15:01,035 --> 01:15:01,969
Hey guys.

1111
01:15:03,437 --> 01:15:06,805
Damn, this salty air
really dries up a girl.

1112
01:15:06,807 --> 01:15:09,744
[mystical chiming]

1113
01:15:46,046 --> 01:15:50,217
Now you see, Tenan, you
haven't forgotten a thing.

1114
01:15:51,619 --> 01:15:54,422
That image pulled straight
from your consciousness.

1115
01:15:55,890 --> 01:16:00,292
That Croathian fire you
hold deep down in your soul,

1116
01:16:00,294 --> 01:16:03,062
keeps the essence of your family alive.

1117
01:16:03,064 --> 01:16:06,767
And you lose that and you'll
truly lose them forever.

1118
01:16:07,902 --> 01:16:10,604
Yes, sire, I won't forget again.

1119
01:16:11,972 --> 01:16:12,807
Good.

1120
01:16:14,408 --> 01:16:16,877
Sire, Tenan, was that your family?

1121
01:16:17,878 --> 01:16:19,511
Yes, it was.

1122
01:16:19,513 --> 01:16:21,513
Oh man, sire, you
totally got to do me next

1123
01:16:21,515 --> 01:16:22,981
because there's people I wanna see too.

1124
01:16:22,983 --> 01:16:26,819
Like, oh, there was this prince,
oh my God, he was so fine.

1125
01:16:26,821 --> 01:16:29,054
Oh, he can totally have me any time.

1126
01:16:29,056 --> 01:16:31,091
But he, like, talked, like, all the time.

1127
01:16:38,566 --> 01:16:40,801
Whoa, what have I missed?

1128
01:16:41,735 --> 01:16:42,568
Oh, you know what,

1129
01:16:42,570 --> 01:16:44,136
there was this fucking
tyrant that I killed

1130
01:16:44,138 --> 01:16:45,571
from the city of Torbin,

1131
01:16:45,573 --> 01:16:49,074
and then I stole all
his precious collection-

1132
01:16:49,076 --> 01:16:52,344
[boat crashing]

1133
01:16:52,346 --> 01:16:53,712
What was that?

1134
01:16:53,714 --> 01:16:55,216
Sil's killing squads.

1135
01:16:55,716 --> 01:16:58,152
So you want to fight an Neptonian king?

1136
01:17:00,654 --> 01:17:01,555
BLADE TO FLAME!

1137
01:17:03,657 --> 01:17:06,327
GWAR-ZOW-TO-BOR-NYE-TO-FLAME!

1138
01:17:10,431 --> 01:17:13,200
[dramatic music]

1139
01:17:13,254 --> 01:17:18,254
