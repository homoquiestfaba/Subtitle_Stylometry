00:01:20,346 --> 00:01:23,405
[Jon Corwin] Erin was friends
with my little sister.

12
00:01:23,407 --> 00:01:24,573
That's how I met her.

13
00:01:24,591 --> 00:01:27,592
But then, one day,

14
00:01:27,745 --> 00:01:30,429
I opened the front door
to let the little Erin in,

15
00:01:30,581 --> 00:01:32,356
And...

16
00:01:32,507 --> 00:01:35,025
There, instead,
was this beautiful girl

17
00:01:35,177 --> 00:01:37,602
Smiling back at me.

I was done for.

21
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:47,279
She had me.

[Jon] I didn't mean

It's just, uh...

26
00:02:00,110 --> 00:02:03,703
Erin and I have been going
together for two years now,

27
00:02:03,723 --> 00:02:05,797
And I was raised

28
00:02:05,950 --> 00:02:08,559
That you should ask
the parents' permission.

[Jon takes a shaky breath]

30
00:02:10,454 --> 00:02:12,980

I love your daughter.

00:02:16,310 --> 00:02:17,292

Look, you know,

Why is that?

'cause I'm at a big fancy ball
with my guy.

You know,

59
00:03:35,706 --> 00:03:37,297
I was talking

You came downstairs so quick,

the people-eating show?

373
00:18:45,706 --> 00:18:47,114
[chuckles]
I'm a couple episodes behind.

374
00:18:47,116 --> 00:18:48,641
I gotta catch up online.

375
00:18:49,894 --> 00:18:51,452
Prepare to die.

376
00:18:51,454 --> 00:18:53,229
[scoffs, laughing] okay.

377
00:18:53,306 --> 00:18:55,380
I think I can handle you.

378
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:57,124
Oh, honey, I am way more
than you can handle.

379
00:18:57,126 --> 00:18:59,794
Oh. That's neat.
That's a nice trick.

380
00:18:59,812 --> 00:19:00,812
[Erin laughing]

381
00:19:00,964 --> 00:19:02,797
Oh, yeah, I see you now.
I see you now.

382
00:19:02,815 --> 00:19:03,631
You're right there
around the corner.

383
00:19:03,649 --> 00:19:04,465
Don't cheat.

384
00:19:04,484 --> 00:19:05,816
This is war!

385
00:19:05,969 --> 00:19:07,818
Okay.

386
00:19:07,971 --> 00:19:10,091
Are you gonna be able
to behave yourself?

387
00:19:12,917 --> 00:19:14,417
I don't think so.

388
00:19:16,312 --> 00:19:18,546

390
00:19:56,369 --> 00:19:57,754
<i>I told you, I haven't seen her</i>

391
00:19:57,778 --> 00:19:59,832
Since that morning...
I don't know where she is.

392
00:19:59,856 --> 00:20:01,188
[detective woods]
Jon, you can understand

393
00:20:01,207 --> 00:20:03,633
Why we might have
a little trouble believing you.

394
00:20:07,697 --> 00:20:10,548
Yeah.

395
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:11,891
I'm the husband.

396
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:17,271
Cops always
suspect the husband first.

397
00:20:23,396 --> 00:20:24,712
[Nichole] oh, honey,
all you gotta do

398
00:20:24,730 --> 00:20:25,804
Is put peanut butter on it...
Problem solved.

399
00:20:25,824 --> 00:20:26,805
Really?

400
00:20:26,825 --> 00:20:28,399
Mm-hmm. Yeah.

401
00:20:28,551 --> 00:20:29,975
You know, anything green that
they won't eat... doesn't matter.

402
00:20:29,994 --> 00:20:32,047
Oh, and, um, smooth or crunchy,
it doesn't really matter...

403
00:20:32,071 --> 00:20:33,271
Whichever one he likes best.

404
00:20:33,314 --> 00:20:34,497
[ash] hmm.

405
00:20:34,574 --> 00:20:36,223
Sorry, Erin.

406
00:20:36,242 --> 00:20:37,892
You probably don't want
to talk about this.

407
00:20:37,910 --> 00:20:39,335
No. It's... Fine.

408
00:20:40,672 --> 00:20:42,057
Liberty, you want
to go on the slide?

409
00:20:42,081 --> 00:20:43,225
-Yeah!
Jump off!

410
00:20:43,249 --> 00:20:44,249
Let's go!

411
00:20:44,325 --> 00:20:45,394
Nice one! Let's race!

412
00:20:45,418 --> 00:20:47,134
Go, go, go, go, go!

- You all done with this?
- Thanks.

[chuckles]

421
00:22:47,857 --> 00:22:48,857
Hey.

422
00:22:53,304 --> 00:22:54,762
What're you lookin' at?

423
00:22:56,032 --> 00:22:57,139
Nothing.

424
00:22:57,291 --> 00:22:58,699
It's just damn near midnight

425
00:22:58,718 --> 00:23:00,918
And you're still looking
like a million bucks.

426
00:23:04,890 --> 00:23:06,970
You feeling weird
about the other night?

427
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:08,467
No.

428
00:23:08,486 --> 00:23:11,212
[laughs]

429
00:23:11,230 --> 00:23:13,489
Uh, I'm feeling weird
about not feeling weird.

430
00:23:14,884 --> 00:23:17,401
I don't know.

431
00:23:17,553 --> 00:23:18,553
You?

432
00:23:20,056 --> 00:23:21,664
Yeah, me too.

433
00:23:23,075 --> 00:23:25,167
And we fully kissed.

434
00:23:25,244 --> 00:23:27,244
I doubt
that little peck qualifies.

435
00:23:29,507 --> 00:23:31,173
What exactly...

436
00:23:31,250 --> 00:23:33,009
Is a kiss to you?

437
00:23:34,737 --> 00:23:36,512
You want me to show you?

438
00:23:40,184 --> 00:23:41,909
Absolutely not.

439
00:23:41,927 --> 00:23:43,055
- [Chris laughs]
- no.

440
00:23:43,079 --> 00:23:45,596
I don't believe you.

441
00:23:45,748 --> 00:23:48,082
So here's what's gonna happen.

442
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:50,693
I'm gonna bring my lips

443
00:23:50,770 --> 00:23:53,420
Closer and closer to yours,

444
00:23:53,439 --> 00:23:57,533
And if you are firm
about "absolutely not"...

445
00:23:57,684 --> 00:23:59,368
Hmm?

446
00:23:59,445 --> 00:24:01,485
All you gotta do
is turn your head.

447
00:24:08,604 --> 00:24:10,271
Oh...

448
00:24:10,289 --> 00:24:12,339
The point of no return.

449
00:24:14,218 --> 00:24:16,385
[♪♪]

450
00:24:30,142 --> 00:24:31,567
There.

451
00:24:31,718 --> 00:24:32,793
Now that's out of our systems.

452
00:24:32,812 --> 00:24:35,237
We can just be friends.

453
00:24:36,741 --> 00:24:39,075
[♪♪]

454
00:24:41,487 --> 00:24:42,912
Goodnight.

00:24:57,320 --> 00:24:59,169
Yeah!

459
00:24:59,322 --> 00:25:00,763
Whoo!

460
00:25:03,750 --> 00:25:06,251
Oh, Chris.
I'm gonna hurl.

461
00:25:06,270 --> 00:25:08,771
Let her out. I don't want her
to puke in my truck.

462
00:25:14,019 --> 00:25:15,169
You gonna be okay?

463
00:25:15,187 --> 00:25:16,428
- Yes. Yes.
- You sure?

464
00:25:16,447 --> 00:25:17,613
Come on!

465
00:25:17,690 --> 00:25:18,839
You wanna go muddin',
we're goin' muddin'

466
00:25:18,858 --> 00:25:20,950
- Come on, Jon.
- Yeah, yeah, here we go.

467
00:25:21,101 --> 00:25:22,434
All right.

468
00:25:22,453 --> 00:25:23,768
Whoo!

469
00:25:23,788 --> 00:25:25,412
[tires squealing]

00:25:29,201 --> 00:25:31,293
[laughing]

471
00:25:36,450 --> 00:25:38,003
Told you it was safer
in the truck.

472
00:25:38,027 --> 00:25:39,026
Ha, ha, ha.

473
00:25:39,028 --> 00:25:40,430
Yeah, you're
a bucketful of laughs.

474
00:25:40,454 --> 00:25:42,304
[Nichole snickering]

475
00:25:44,124 --> 00:25:45,764
- Say when.
- Mm-hmm.

476
00:25:46,793 --> 00:25:47,885
Oh, my god.

477
00:25:48,037 --> 00:25:49,370
Okay. Okay.

478
00:25:49,388 --> 00:25:51,388
Now would be good.
Now would be good.

479
00:25:54,152 --> 00:25:57,469
All right, all right.
This ain't spring break, man.

481
00:26:20,586 --> 00:26:21,402
Hey.

Hi.

483
00:26:26,926 --> 00:26:29,834
Nice day for a...
Horse ride, isn't it?

[whinnying]

487
00:26:43,943 --> 00:26:45,701
Whoa. Easy, girl. Easy.

488
00:26:47,354 --> 00:26:49,274
That's right.
I'm you're friend.

489
00:26:50,599 --> 00:26:52,875
You got the magic touch.

490
00:26:53,026 --> 00:26:55,936
She's just a ball of stress.

491
00:26:55,955 --> 00:26:57,213
I just want her to know

492
00:26:57,364 --> 00:26:59,008
That anything
she's been through before

493
00:26:59,032 --> 00:27:00,274
Is over now.

494
00:27:00,276 --> 00:27:02,676
Huh. I know the feeling.

495
00:27:04,055 --> 00:27:07,056
Sometimes, I feel like I could
use a "human whisperer."

496
00:27:11,062 --> 00:27:13,729
Do you ever think that
being in the war messed you up?

497
00:27:15,624 --> 00:27:17,399
I don't know.

498
00:27:19,462 --> 00:27:21,720
When you see
that kind of stuff...

499
00:27:21,739 --> 00:27:23,697
It changes you.

500
00:27:26,135 --> 00:27:27,370
Sometimes, I think those scars

501
00:27:27,394 --> 00:27:29,434
Are even worse
than the physical ones.

502
00:27:30,581 --> 00:27:32,781
Don't tell that to my buddy
who lost his leg.

503
00:27:34,159 --> 00:27:35,751
Yeah, it can be tough.

504
00:27:40,907 --> 00:27:42,332
It's funny.

505
00:27:42,485 --> 00:27:43,886
I can talk to you
about this kind of stuff,

506
00:27:43,910 --> 00:27:45,150
But I can't with my own wife.

507
00:27:46,505 --> 00:27:48,505
She doesn't know
how to deal with it.

508
00:27:49,325 --> 00:27:50,766
I hope you can talk to me.

509
00:27:50,843 --> 00:27:53,435
I hope I... I'm able to say
something helpful.

Come on, boy! Yeah!

Come on, we got this!

514
00:28:09,695 --> 00:28:10,786
Whoo-hoo!

515
00:28:15,184 --> 00:28:17,293
I can't take you anywhere, huh?

516
00:28:17,444 --> 00:28:19,324
Told you... I did it on purpose.

517
00:28:19,355 --> 00:28:20,296
Yeah, okay.

518
00:28:20,372 --> 00:28:22,412
Falling off a horse
builds character.

519
00:28:23,450 --> 00:28:24,633
Hmm.

520
00:28:24,785 --> 00:28:25,950
[Chris sighs]

521
00:28:25,970 --> 00:28:27,803
Nice underwear.

522
00:28:27,954 --> 00:28:29,363
It's my lucky pair.

523
00:28:29,381 --> 00:28:32,308
Yeah. Wasn't so lucky
for you today.

524
00:28:32,459 --> 00:28:34,476
The day's still young.

00:28:47,399 --> 00:28:48,860
Oh, my god, I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry.

528
00:28:48,884 --> 00:28:50,308
I'm... I'm messing with you.

529
00:28:50,328 --> 00:28:52,494
Stop!

530
00:28:52,646 --> 00:28:54,366
Stop it!
Don't do that to me!

531
00:28:54,390 --> 00:28:56,390
Do not do that to me.

532
00:28:56,408 --> 00:28:58,500

Hey! Uh...

Isabel.

535
00:29:03,007 --> 00:29:06,842
So, there was this cactus
out on the trail...

536
00:29:06,993 --> 00:29:08,073
I went down the hill.

537
00:29:09,588 --> 00:29:11,180
Close call.

538
00:29:11,256 --> 00:29:13,331
[Erin]<i> ...And so, as soon</i>
<i>as I get him all cleaned up,</i>

539
00:29:13,351 --> 00:29:15,144
He trips and stumbles
into this other cactus...

540
00:29:15,168 --> 00:29:16,835
But he's just...
Just playing around.

541
00:29:16,854 --> 00:29:18,579
He's so silly.

542
00:29:18,597 --> 00:29:20,505
Erin, what are you doing?

543
00:29:20,524 --> 00:29:22,227
<i>What do you mean?
I'm not doing anything.</i>

544
00:29:22,251 --> 00:29:23,842
You're totally crushing

545
00:29:23,861 --> 00:29:24,861
<i>On this guy.</i>

546
00:29:24,937 --> 00:29:26,177
Oh... Shh.

547
00:29:26,197 --> 00:29:27,512
No. I'm... I'm not.

<i>Erin.</i>

549
00:29:28,774 --> 00:29:29,940
You can't fool me.

550
00:29:30,092 --> 00:29:31,091
<i>We're just friends.</i>

551
00:29:31,110 --> 00:29:32,776
We're just hanging out.

552
00:29:32,928 --> 00:29:34,018
Well, that's all good.

553
00:29:34,038 --> 00:29:36,038
Just remember...

554

00:39:02,681 --> 00:39:03,421
You wanna do it again?

739
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:04,731
[Erin] yeah, come on.

742
00:39:38,141 --> 00:39:40,700
- Hey.
- Hey.

743
00:39:40,719 --> 00:39:42,727
Ohh.

744

746
00:40:10,007 --> 00:40:11,655
You know, I...

747
00:40:11,675 --> 00:40:14,658
I kinda go on about
the war stories with the guys.

748
00:40:14,678 --> 00:40:16,594
Yeah?

749
00:40:18,515 --> 00:40:21,266
I've never seen a day of combat
in my life.

750
00:40:23,578 --> 00:40:26,504
I mean, I've seen a lot
of terrible things out there.

751
00:40:26,523 --> 00:40:28,356
That's no lie.

752
00:40:29,768 --> 00:40:31,675
I was...

753
00:40:31,695 --> 00:40:33,862
Basically
a glorified security guard.

754
00:40:34,013 --> 00:40:36,514
Hey.

755
00:40:36,533 --> 00:40:39,534
I've never fired a single shot
at a living target.

756
00:40:43,356 --> 00:40:44,873
It's pretty lame.

757
00:40:46,209 --> 00:40:49,452
You still served your country.

758
00:40:49,604 --> 00:40:51,671
I think that's pretty cool.

759
00:40:52,791 --> 00:40:54,382
Yeah?

760
00:40:54,534 --> 00:40:56,334
You gonna give me a medal?

761
00:40:58,463 --> 00:41:00,972
[♪♪]

762
00:41:03,134 --> 00:41:04,186
[Nichole] hey, Chris!

763
00:41:04,210 --> 00:41:05,560
Time to go home.

764
00:41:05,637 --> 00:41:08,212
Oh, come on, ma!
It's still early!

765
00:41:08,231 --> 00:41:10,398
Ha, ha, ha. Very funny.

766
00:41:11,810 --> 00:41:12,975
Bye...

767
00:41:13,128 --> 00:41:15,070
Bye.

768
00:41:16,573 --> 00:41:19,157
Okay! Let's go!

[breath shaking]

774
00:42:47,831 --> 00:42:49,998
Wake up, you son of a bitch!

775
00:42:50,149 --> 00:42:52,225
- I said wake up!
- Come on!

776
00:42:52,243 --> 00:42:53,371
Did you really think
I wouldn't find out

777
00:42:53,395 --> 00:42:54,169
About you and that slut?

778
00:42:54,320 --> 00:42:56,004
What're you talking about?

779
00:42:56,155 --> 00:42:57,563
You're sloppy
and you're stupid, Chris!

780
00:42:57,582 --> 00:42:59,490
Explain yourself.

781
00:42:59,509 --> 00:43:02,235
Baby, this...
This is just us goofing around.

782
00:43:02,253 --> 00:43:03,639
You have been caught, you moron!

783
00:43:03,663 --> 00:43:05,588
Be a man, for god's sakes!

784
00:43:05,740 --> 00:43:06,997
[panicked breathing]

785
00:43:07,017 --> 00:43:09,166
Look, Nichole...

786
00:43:09,186 --> 00:43:11,066
This really didn't go that far.

787
00:43:12,414 --> 00:43:13,688
How far did it go?

788
00:43:14,840 --> 00:43:16,858
We j...
We just made out a little.

789
00:43:17,009 --> 00:43:18,251
Okay? It was just kissing.

790
00:43:18,269 --> 00:43:19,419
You go to hell!

791
00:43:19,437 --> 00:43:20,989
- Come on, Nichole!
- [Nichole rages]

792
00:43:21,013 --> 00:43:22,416
It just went
from one thing to another,

793
00:43:22,440 --> 00:43:23,606
And I don't know...

794
00:43:23,758 --> 00:43:25,683
I swear to god,
we never had sex!

795
00:43:25,702 --> 00:43:27,202
We just talked about things...

796
00:43:27,353 --> 00:43:28,997
Things that, I don't know, that
I can't talk about with you!

797
00:43:29,021 --> 00:43:31,242
Oh, so it's my fault
because you can't talk to me.

798
00:43:31,266 --> 00:43:33,190
- That's not what I'm saying!
- Well, what are you saying?

799
00:43:33,210 --> 00:43:35,526
I'm just having
so much trouble adjust...

800
00:43:35,545 --> 00:43:37,081
That is just
a goddamned excuse, Chris!

801
00:43:37,105 --> 00:43:38,104
No, it's not an excuse...

802
00:43:38,106 --> 00:43:39,214
Do not touch me!

803
00:43:39,365 --> 00:43:41,699
Do not touch me right now.

804
00:43:41,718 --> 00:43:43,033
[Chris] what do you
want me to do?

805
00:43:43,053 --> 00:43:44,444
[Nichole] I told you,
I want you to go to hell!

806
00:43:44,462 --> 00:43:45,945
[Chris] I said I'm sorry!

807
00:43:45,964 --> 00:43:47,371
[Nichole]
I don't care if you're sorry!

808
00:43:47,390 --> 00:43:48,948
I'm keeping your phone, Chris,

809
00:43:48,950 --> 00:43:50,594
And whatever this thing is
with her,

810
00:43:50,618 --> 00:43:51,467
You're gonna end it!

811
00:43:51,619 --> 00:43:52,802
Now!

812
00:43:52,954 --> 00:43:55,563
And she better hope
that I never see her alone,

813
00:43:55,640 --> 00:43:58,233
Because I will kill her ass...
And I mean dead!

814
00:43:58,384 --> 00:43:59,400
[♪♪]

815
00:44:06,801 --> 00:44:08,910
I told her
we barely did anything,

816
00:44:08,987 --> 00:44:10,970
But, obviously, she didn't care.

817
00:44:10,989 --> 00:44:13,155
Oh, my god.

818
00:44:13,308 --> 00:44:15,708
We're caught.
It's over.

819
00:44:19,572 --> 00:44:20,813
So what do we do?

820
00:44:20,832 --> 00:44:22,482
What can we do?

821
00:44:22,484 --> 00:44:23,983
I don't want this
to end my marriage

822
00:44:24,002 --> 00:44:26,486
And I'm sure you don't want it
to end yours, either.

823
00:44:26,504 --> 00:44:28,988
No.

824
00:44:28,990 --> 00:44:31,915
No. No. Right.

825
00:44:31,935 --> 00:44:33,659
This goofing around...

826
00:44:33,678 --> 00:44:35,603
It's not worth it, right?

827
00:44:35,755 --> 00:44:38,164
I'm gonna to be discharged
any day now,

828
00:44:38,166 --> 00:44:42,443
And we're probably gonna
move back to Alaska.

829
00:44:42,595 --> 00:44:44,520
Erin, this was fun, but...

830
00:44:44,672 --> 00:44:47,097
It's gotta end.

831
00:44:47,117 --> 00:44:48,866
Yeah.

832
00:44:50,194 --> 00:44:51,577
Was what it was.

833
00:44:55,700 --> 00:44:58,459
We always knew it was gonna
have to end eventually, right?

What's the matter?

840
00:45:22,377 --> 00:45:23,377
Nothing.

841
00:45:24,712 --> 00:45:25,712
You sure?

842
00:45:27,899 --> 00:45:28,990
Yeah.

843
00:45:30,718 --> 00:45:33,477
Do you wanna maybe...

844
00:45:33,496 --> 00:45:37,223
You wanna maybe go home
for a couple of days?

845
00:45:37,241 --> 00:45:39,036
I've got
some time off coming up.

846
00:45:39,060 --> 00:45:40,317
Why don't we go back
to Tennessee,

847
00:45:40,337 --> 00:45:42,337
See your mom and dad?

848
00:45:42,488 --> 00:45:43,821
That sound good?

849
00:45:43,840 --> 00:45:45,989
Yeah.

855
00:46:22,545 --> 00:46:24,528
Sweetheart.

856
00:46:24,547 --> 00:46:26,631
Tell me what's wrong.

857
00:46:29,460 --> 00:46:32,053
You were right.
Marriage is hard.

858
00:46:33,448 --> 00:46:35,223
Talk to me, honey.

859
00:46:35,374 --> 00:46:36,849
What's the matter?

860
00:46:38,469 --> 00:46:40,728
[sobs] I don't know.

861

Well, I know

That boy

He would do anything on earth
to make you happy.

- [faintly] yeah.
- Right?

871
00:47:13,763 --> 00:47:16,839
Yeah. I'm sure.
I just needed to cry.

872
00:47:16,991 --> 00:47:18,157
You know.

873
00:47:18,176 --> 00:47:20,296
You know,
I'm probably just being stupid.

874
00:47:22,013 --> 00:47:23,496
Never.

00:47:23,514 --> 00:47:24,605

Hey. You feeling better?

I'm glad you kept that dress.

No.

Nothing like that.

889
00:48:39,240 --> 00:48:40,422
We were good.

00:48:40,575 --> 00:48:43,351
We...<i> Are</i> good.

We're happy.

Was there
some big blow-up with Erin

893
00:48:50,193 --> 00:48:51,859
Before she disappeared?

Aww, man.

I know it hurts now,

900
00:49:11,956 --> 00:49:13,697
You'll see it made you stronger.

- Yeah, yeah...
- oh! Ringer!

902
00:49:16,386 --> 00:49:17,885
Stuff it, buddy!

Damn, Nichole.

Why don't you just
drink out of the pitcher?

910
00:49:30,141 --> 00:49:32,625
Just giving myself
some liquid courage.

911
00:49:32,643 --> 00:49:35,144
[ash] oh, crap.
Do I even wanna ask?

912
00:49:35,296 --> 00:49:37,456
Why didn't you
tell me about Chris and Erin?

913
00:49:38,241 --> 00:49:40,390
Chris told me you knew.

914
00:49:40,410 --> 00:49:42,225
I thought we were friends, ash.

Listen, Nichole,

things to escalate.

[scoffs bitterly]
well, it's gonna escalate.

Okay, well, listen.

It's over between them.

00:49:52,422 --> 00:49:54,330
Okay?

922
00:49:54,482 --> 00:49:56,665
Why dredge this up?

923
00:49:56,818 --> 00:49:58,575
No one else needs to get hurt...

924
00:49:58,595 --> 00:50:00,820
So I guess it's just wrong
to speak the truth around here?

925
00:50:00,838 --> 00:50:02,633
Absolutely.
Think about it.

926
00:50:02,657 --> 00:50:04,056
Oh, I have.

927

You think it'd be okay
if I had my daughter back?

931
00:50:12,016 --> 00:50:13,423
- Wait, one second.
- [Erin] yeah, of course.

932
00:50:13,443 --> 00:50:15,167
- We're just playing.
- Yeah.

933
00:50:15,169 --> 00:50:16,738
You like "playing"
with my family?

934

Hey! Hey, Nichole.

935
00:50:17,855 --> 00:50:19,505
- Uh, I could...
- in a minute, ash!

936
00:50:19,523 --> 00:50:21,598
I want to talk
to my friend, Erin, here.

937
00:50:21,618 --> 00:50:23,784
[Chris] hey, Nichole!

938
00:50:23,861 --> 00:50:25,339
Why don't you and ash
come play doubles?

939
00:50:25,363 --> 00:50:27,323
I thought
it was Jon's turn next.

940
00:50:27,348 --> 00:50:28,271
Don't want to cheat him.

941
00:50:28,291 --> 00:50:30,124
That's okay. I'm good.

942
00:50:31,519 --> 00:50:32,852
Oh, you're good, Jon?

943
00:50:32,854 --> 00:50:34,111
You're "good"?

944
00:50:34,130 --> 00:50:35,796
He's good!

945
00:50:35,873 --> 00:50:37,759
Well, I wouldn't want him
to feel left out.

946
00:50:37,783 --> 00:50:39,503
Nichole, why don't you
come and sit down?

947
00:50:39,527 --> 00:50:40,784
Here, babe.

948
00:50:40,803 --> 00:50:41,883
Have your phone back.

You've been a real good boy.

Hey, Jon.

Oh, yeah!

For about a month or so,

962
00:51:13,077 --> 00:51:15,895
She has been
sneaking around with him.

963

Obviously, I wasn't thinking.
The little guy was.

Yeah, you mean the, uh,
you mean the really little guy?

Oh, is that why all the ladies
call me "kielbasa"?

986
00:53:04,522 --> 00:53:06,882
No, they call you kielbasa
because of your breath, bro.

Hey, so I think my mom
is planning a trip out

00:53:51,385 --> 00:53:52,660
For my birthday.

997
00:53:52,811 --> 00:53:54,386
She sent me
this monster grocery list,

998
00:53:54,388 --> 00:53:56,055
So I think
she's planning on cooking

999
00:53:56,073 --> 00:53:57,739
The entire time she's here.

1000
00:53:57,892 --> 00:53:59,892
That sounds good.

I just don't want her stuck

In the kitchen

1004
00:54:05,324 --> 00:54:06,710
So I was thinking
maybe we could think of

1005
00:54:06,734 --> 00:54:07,733
Some fun things
around town to do with her.

1006

Come on.

You can't think of one fun thing
to do with her?

I wish you would
just yell at me.

It's better than
this passive-aggressive thing.

I'm just reading the menu.

1018

You said you forgave me.

I did forgive you.

I just want to move on.

How are we supposed to move on
if we don't talk about it?

What's the point?

1023
00:54:49,034 --> 00:54:50,292
It happened.

I forgive you.

What's to talk about?

1026
00:54:53,464 --> 00:54:55,538
How about the fact that
I've been a horrible wife to you

1027
00:54:55,558 --> 00:54:58,392
And you don't seem to care
the least bit about it?

It makes me feel like
you don't love me anymore.

I could serve you
divorce papers.

Nobody saw her after that.

Hey. You haven't talked

<i>Hi. This is Erin.</i>

So no one saw you that morning?

I don't think
I left the house until later.

What were you doing all day?

1130
01:01:26,857 --> 01:01:28,340
Just gaming.

1131
01:01:28,358 --> 01:01:29,283
[woods] meanwhile, your wife

1132
01:01:29,359 --> 01:01:31,279
Is out in the middle of nowhere.

1133
01:01:31,862 --> 01:01:34,270
You think that she had a...

1134
01:01:34,290 --> 01:01:36,364
Bad sense of direction.

1135
01:01:36,517 --> 01:01:38,608
You weren't worried
she would get lost?

1136
01:01:38,627 --> 01:01:40,352
What was I supposed to do?

1137
01:01:40,370 --> 01:01:43,046
Say "no, you can't go"?

1138
01:01:44,525 --> 01:01:45,782
She just did it.

1139
01:01:45,801 --> 01:01:48,193
And it got late.

1140
01:01:48,211 --> 01:01:50,529
She didn't come home and...

1141
01:01:50,547 --> 01:01:53,031
That's when I started
to get really worried.

1142
01:01:53,050 --> 01:01:55,124
Why'd you wait so long?

1143
01:01:55,144 --> 01:01:56,810
Well, you know,

1144
01:01:56,961 --> 01:01:58,698
Cops don't even
consider a person missing

1145
01:01:58,722 --> 01:02:00,797
Until they're gone 48 hours.

1146
01:02:00,816 --> 01:02:02,316
[Det. Tabor scoffs dubiously]

1147
01:02:03,560 --> 01:02:05,279
I mean, I see that
on TV all the time.

1148
01:02:05,303 --> 01:02:07,228
But by the time you called us,

1149
01:02:07,381 --> 01:02:10,215
Your pregnant wife was missing
for a full 24 hours

Out in 2,000 square miles

In 110-degree heat.

Do you have any idea

1153
01:02:16,406 --> 01:02:18,832
How dangerous that kind of heat
is to a pregnant woman?

1154
01:02:18,983 --> 01:02:19,891
Yeah, nobody knew
where you were.

1155
01:02:19,910 --> 01:02:21,560
Everyone knew where I was.

1156
01:02:21,578 --> 01:02:23,170
I went to everybody I know.

1157
01:02:23,246 --> 01:02:24,838
I called up everyone I know.

1158
01:02:24,989 --> 01:02:26,064
[woods] yeah... You did.

1159
01:02:26,066 --> 01:02:28,733
Hours after Erin went missing.

1160

You made sure
that everybody you know

Heard your worried voice
that day.

1162
01:02:33,240 --> 01:02:34,308
It's not like I was...

1163
01:02:34,332 --> 01:02:35,515
Listen to me, Jon.

This is the most important
moment of your life.

I'm detective tabor.
This is detective woods.

We're talking
to all the residents

01:03:09,276 --> 01:03:11,109
And we were wondering
if we could ask you

1177
01:03:11,128 --> 01:03:12,513
A few questions about
your next door neighbor,

1178
01:03:12,537 --> 01:03:13,778
Erin corwin?

01:03:13,797 --> 01:03:16,723
Yeah? Uh... 'course.

1180
01:03:16,800 --> 01:03:18,111
[woods] you heard
that she's missing?

1181
01:03:18,135 --> 01:03:21,395
Yeah. I mean, everyone has.

1182
01:03:21,546 --> 01:03:23,045
Do you remember the last time
that you saw her?

1183
01:03:23,065 --> 01:03:25,065
God, it's gotta be...

1184

A couple weeks ago now, I guess.

1185
01:03:27,628 --> 01:03:29,310
What's going on?

1186
01:03:29,463 --> 01:03:31,630
Well, we were just asking
about your missing neighbor.

1187
01:03:31,632 --> 01:03:32,722
You're Mrs. Lee?

1188
01:03:32,741 --> 01:03:33,890
Yeah.

1189
01:03:33,909 --> 01:03:36,225
Did you guys ever talk?

1190
01:03:36,245 --> 01:03:39,395
Did she ever confide in you
about anything personal?

1191
01:03:39,415 --> 01:03:40,914
[laughs uncomfortably]

1192
01:03:40,991 --> 01:03:44,066
Um, yeah, I mean,
we'd, like, hang out sometimes,

1193
01:03:44,086 --> 01:03:46,305
But they sort of do their thing,
we sort of do ours.

1194
01:03:46,329 --> 01:03:47,421
Mm-hmm.

1195
01:03:47,497 --> 01:03:49,238
- You and Jon are both marines?
- Yeah.

1196
01:03:49,258 --> 01:03:51,407
Did you ever hang out,
just the two of you?

1197
01:03:51,427 --> 01:03:53,427
Me and Jon? No.

1198
01:03:53,578 --> 01:03:54,669
Never.

1199
01:03:54,821 --> 01:03:56,821
[woods] so he never
talked about his wife?

1200
01:03:56,840 --> 01:03:58,484
Or how things were going
in his marriage?

1201
01:03:58,508 --> 01:03:59,599
I don't have

1202
01:03:59,676 --> 01:04:01,471

for you guys.

1203
01:04:01,495 --> 01:04:02,251
Sorry.

1204
01:04:02,271 --> 01:04:03,770
Okay.

1205
01:04:03,847 --> 01:04:07,332
Well, if anything comes to you
that you think might help,

1206
01:04:07,350 --> 01:04:09,230
Please don't hesitate to call.

San Bernardino county
sheriff's department

Informs us that the FBI
and border patrol,

1211
01:04:27,871 --> 01:04:30,355
As well as los Angeles
and Kern county sheriffs,

1212
01:04:30,373 --> 01:04:32,691
Are all participating

1213
01:04:32,709 --> 01:04:34,634
For 19-year-old Erin corwin.

1214
01:04:36,880 --> 01:04:38,972
[Jessie]
this is really hard for me.

1215
01:04:39,123 --> 01:04:41,700
I would never betray a secret,

1216
01:04:41,702 --> 01:04:43,643
But I'm getting really scared.

1217
01:04:43,720 --> 01:04:44,760
Their neighbor said

1218
01:04:44,871 --> 01:04:46,365
They'd hear them
fighting all the time.

1219
01:04:46,389 --> 01:04:47,647
Well...

1220
01:04:47,799 --> 01:04:49,869
If they were fighting,
it was probably about him.

1221
01:04:49,893 --> 01:04:51,985
"him"? Who?

1222
01:04:52,136 --> 01:04:53,211
Chris.

Jessie.

1225
01:04:58,401 --> 01:05:00,719
Just tell me what happened.

1226
01:05:00,737 --> 01:05:02,657
Why would they fight
about Chris?

1227
01:05:04,558 --> 01:05:07,667
Erin and Chris had a thing
for a little bit.

1228
01:05:07,819 --> 01:05:09,836
[♪♪]

1229
01:05:09,913 --> 01:05:12,397
All they ever did,
pretty much, is kiss each other,

1230
01:05:12,399 --> 01:05:13,322
And that's as far as it went.

1231
01:05:13,342 --> 01:05:15,342
[♪♪]

1232
01:05:17,087 --> 01:05:18,762
Chris and Erin had an affair?

1233
01:05:20,073 --> 01:05:21,901
I don't know
if I would call it that,

1234
01:05:21,925 --> 01:05:24,144
But, yeah, they were
playing around a little bit.

1235
01:05:24,168 --> 01:05:25,408
But, after the wife found out,

1236

<i>They ended things,</i>

1237
01:05:26,763 --> 01:05:28,004
And then that was that.

1238
01:05:28,023 --> 01:05:29,672
It got ugly for a minute,

1239
01:05:29,691 --> 01:05:31,750
But everyone got past it.

1240
01:05:31,768 --> 01:05:32,768
It ended.

1241
01:05:32,844 --> 01:05:34,528
Everyone got past it?

1242
01:05:34,679 --> 01:05:35,862
Even Erin's husband?

I don't know.

01:05:42,095 --> 01:05:44,854
Erin tried completely hard
to get over him,

1246

<i>But... That stupid poem.</i>

1247
01:05:46,708 --> 01:05:48,458
So you don't forget about me.

She had just fallen
so hard for him.

1259

You're like a secret of mine,

Yeah. I'm sure it's yours.

01:07:18,191 --> 01:07:20,300
[♪♪]

1277
01:07:31,295 --> 01:07:33,629
- Hi.
- Hi.

1278
01:07:33,649 --> 01:07:34,981
I'm just leaving.

1279
01:07:35,133 --> 01:07:38,042
Be careful out there.

1280
01:07:38,061 --> 01:07:39,727
I love you.

1281
01:07:39,880 --> 01:07:41,655
Love you.

1282
01:07:44,734 --> 01:07:46,493
- Okay, bye.
- Bye.

1283
01:07:50,223 --> 01:07:52,749
[♪♪]

1284
01:07:55,486 --> 01:07:57,131
We should
call the police, right?

1285
01:07:57,155 --> 01:07:59,464
[♪♪]

1286
01:08:04,237 --> 01:08:07,013
[♪♪]

1287
01:08:18,418 --> 01:08:19,943
Ahem.

1288
01:08:22,272 --> 01:08:24,088
We brought you back in, Jon,

1289
01:08:24,107 --> 01:08:25,924
Because we now know

1290
01:08:25,942 --> 01:08:27,592
That Erin's baby wasn't yours,

1291
01:08:27,594 --> 01:08:28,776
And you knew it.

1292
01:08:28,929 --> 01:08:29,869
What?

1293
01:08:29,946 --> 01:08:31,095
It wasn't your baby.

1294
01:08:31,114 --> 01:08:33,022
It was Chris's.

1295
01:08:33,041 --> 01:08:35,691
And you couldn't take it.

1296
01:08:35,711 --> 01:08:38,172
What are you talking about?
I never thought it was Chris's.

1297
01:08:38,196 --> 01:08:39,195
Come on.

1298
01:08:39,214 --> 01:08:40,605
You're not stupid, Jon.

1299
01:08:40,623 --> 01:08:42,435
You followed her out
to the desert that morning,

1300
01:08:42,459 --> 01:08:44,125
And you killed her.

1301
01:08:44,277 --> 01:08:47,111
No.

1302
01:08:47,130 --> 01:08:48,947
I didn't.

1303
01:08:48,965 --> 01:08:51,373
We spoke to Erin's mother
and her best friend.

1304
01:08:51,393 --> 01:08:53,618
We know that Erin and Chris
kept seeing each other

1305
01:08:53,636 --> 01:08:55,303
Behind your back.

1306
01:08:55,455 --> 01:08:57,138
What?

1307
01:08:57,290 --> 01:08:59,410
You want to tell us
that you didn't know?

1308
01:09:00,068 --> 01:09:01,985
[sighs]

1309
01:09:03,071 --> 01:09:05,029
[takes a ragged breath]

1310
01:09:08,468 --> 01:09:09,743
I didn't know.

1311
01:09:09,894 --> 01:09:11,393
Yes, you did, Jon.

1312
01:09:11,413 --> 01:09:13,079
You did.

1313
01:09:13,231 --> 01:09:14,748
And that's why you killed her.

1314
01:09:14,899 --> 01:09:18,084
[♪♪]

1315
01:09:18,161 --> 01:09:20,378
I did not kill my wife.

1316
01:09:23,074 --> 01:09:26,092
Your name is Jon corwin?

1317
01:09:26,244 --> 01:09:28,077
Yes.

1318
01:09:28,096 --> 01:09:31,005
Your wife is Erin corwin?

1319
01:09:31,157 --> 01:09:32,599
Yes.

1320
01:09:32,675 --> 01:09:34,934
Do you know where your wife is?

1321
01:09:35,086 --> 01:09:38,271
<i>No.</i>

1322
01:09:38,422 --> 01:09:40,643
<i>Did you have anything
to do with her disappearance?</i>

1323
01:09:40,667 --> 01:09:42,525
<i>No.</i>

1324
01:09:45,614 --> 01:09:48,615
<i>Have you ever caused your wife
any bodily injury?</i>

1325
01:09:49,767 --> 01:09:51,451
No.

1326
01:09:54,772 --> 01:09:56,873
Did you kill your wife?

1327
01:09:58,535 --> 01:10:00,518
You got something?

1328
01:10:00,537 --> 01:10:03,187
A second set of tire tracks.

1329
01:10:03,206 --> 01:10:05,131
She wasn't alone out here.

1330
01:10:07,043 --> 01:10:08,468
No.

1331
01:10:18,462 --> 01:10:19,053
You lied about
your affair with Erin.

1332
01:10:19,205 --> 01:10:20,705
Why?

1333
01:10:20,723 --> 01:10:22,707
I don't know.
I didn't think it was important.

1334
01:10:22,709 --> 01:10:24,444
And I would say, right there,

1335
01:10:24,468 --> 01:10:26,468
You just lied to us again.

1336
01:10:26,488 --> 01:10:28,046
Anything but the truth

1337
01:10:28,064 --> 01:10:30,381
Adds up to be
very bad news for you, Chris.

1338
01:10:30,400 --> 01:10:33,159
That kind of thing is a crime
in the marines.

1339
01:10:33,311 --> 01:10:35,053
It'd get you court-martialed.

1340
01:10:35,071 --> 01:10:36,866
We're not
the marriage police, Chris.

1341
01:10:36,890 --> 01:10:39,165
We don't care
who you do the Macarena with.

1342
01:10:39,242 --> 01:10:41,334
But if your dance partner
goes missing...

1343
01:10:41,411 --> 01:10:43,485
Especially if she's pregnant
with your kid...

1344
01:10:43,505 --> 01:10:46,172
Well, in our profession,
that's what we call

1345
01:10:46,249 --> 01:10:48,157
An intriguing set
of coincidences.

1346
01:10:48,176 --> 01:10:50,401
It wasn't my kid.

1347
01:10:50,420 --> 01:10:51,827
[woods] you sure about that?

1348
01:10:51,847 --> 01:10:53,680
We never had sex.

1349
01:10:53,831 --> 01:10:56,850
Then why all the worry
about court-martial?

1350
01:10:57,001 --> 01:10:59,401
I mean, we-we messed around
a little bit, but that was...

1351
01:10:59,503 --> 01:11:01,057
[tabor] but you never went
all the way?

1352
01:11:01,081 --> 01:11:02,482
We know from Erin's best friend

1353
01:11:02,506 --> 01:11:04,466
That you and Erin
had sex, Chris.

1354
01:11:04,584 --> 01:11:06,192
That's not true.

1355
01:11:06,269 --> 01:11:07,843
Okay, so walk us through it.

1356
01:11:07,863 --> 01:11:10,254
She had sex with you,
but you somehow didn't notice?

1357
01:11:10,273 --> 01:11:11,439
No, I mean that...

1358
01:11:11,591 --> 01:11:14,701
[woods] do you wanna
read through their texts?

1359
01:11:15,853 --> 01:11:17,762
No.

1360
01:11:17,780 --> 01:11:20,790
Assume we know everything.

1361
01:11:22,526 --> 01:11:25,436
I got a wife and kid
that I want to keep.

1362
01:11:25,455 --> 01:11:26,787
You can understand

1363
01:11:26,940 --> 01:11:28,940
Why I wouldn't want this
getting out.

1364
01:11:28,942 --> 01:11:30,625
Oh, we completely understand.

1365
01:11:30,777 --> 01:11:32,443
Matter of fact,

1366
01:11:32,462 --> 01:11:33,794
We could also understand why

1367
01:11:33,947 --> 01:11:36,067
You'd want this whole problem
to go away.

1368
01:11:36,799 --> 01:11:38,349
I never met Erin that day.

1369
01:11:42,380 --> 01:11:44,455
We found Erin's car.

1370
01:11:44,474 --> 01:11:47,792
And two sets of tire tracks.

1371
01:11:47,810 --> 01:11:50,403
One set that matches your jeep.

1372
01:11:52,148 --> 01:11:54,824
I never met Erin that day, guys.

1373
01:11:55,985 --> 01:11:58,060
So why all the lies?

1374
01:11:58,079 --> 01:12:00,246
Where's her body, Chris?

1375
01:12:02,475 --> 01:12:04,900
You don't know?

1376
01:12:04,920 --> 01:12:07,086
See, I thought
you knew everything.

1377
01:12:08,831 --> 01:12:09,923
Chris didn't ask you

1378
01:12:09,999 --> 01:12:11,907
To go with him
to the desert that day?

1379
01:12:11,927 --> 01:12:13,426
No, no. Not that day.

1380
01:12:13,577 --> 01:12:15,457
But you say, normally, he does?

1381
01:12:15,488 --> 01:12:17,597
Yeah.

1382
01:12:17,674 --> 01:12:19,657
So why was that day different,
do you think?

1383
01:12:19,676 --> 01:12:21,061
I don't know, I just assume

1384
01:12:21,085 --> 01:12:24,103
That he was out
looking for a mine shaft.

1385
01:12:24,180 --> 01:12:25,421
Mine shaft?

1386
01:12:25,440 --> 01:12:27,165
Yeah, there's...

1387
01:12:27,183 --> 01:12:29,517
I don't know, there's
millions of 'em out there,

1388
01:12:29,669 --> 01:12:32,670
And Chris always had this idea
that he wanted to, uh...

1389
01:12:32,689 --> 01:12:34,280
Blow up an old mine shaft.

1390
01:12:34,432 --> 01:12:36,632
We'd go out there,
we'd shoot things, you know,

1391
01:12:36,676 --> 01:12:37,858
Blow stuff up.

1392
01:12:38,011 --> 01:12:40,511
But Chris had gotten this, um,
this propane tank,

1393
01:12:40,530 --> 01:12:43,957
And, um, was wanting
to blow up an old mine with it.

1394
01:12:44,033 --> 01:12:46,292
That's helpful. Thanks.

1395
01:12:46,444 --> 01:12:48,252
Yeah.

1396
01:12:49,539 --> 01:12:51,022
[woods]
if anybody can find her,

1397
01:12:51,040 --> 01:12:52,448
It's you, Doug,

1398
01:12:52,467 --> 01:12:53,800
But, regrettably,

1399
01:12:53,876 --> 01:12:55,526
This is no longer
a rescue operation.

1400
01:12:55,528 --> 01:12:57,637
It's now a recovery operation.

1401
01:12:57,714 --> 01:12:59,213
We're acting on a hunch

1402
01:12:59,365 --> 01:13:01,699
That our victim might be down
one of the old mines out here.

1403
01:13:01,718 --> 01:13:03,792
Well, hell, this valley here

1404
01:13:03,812 --> 01:13:06,370
Has a hundred mines
all on its own

1405
01:13:06,389 --> 01:13:07,538
That haven't been marked.

1406
01:13:07,540 --> 01:13:09,373
It's endless.

1407
01:13:09,392 --> 01:13:11,209
Damn near.

1408
01:13:11,227 --> 01:13:13,302
So, basically, we're trying
to find a needle in the desert.

1409
01:13:13,321 --> 01:13:15,471
[chuckles] damn near.

1410
01:13:15,490 --> 01:13:17,740
[♪♪]

1411
01:13:29,170 --> 01:13:31,170
[sighs]

1412
01:13:41,241 --> 01:13:42,682
[thud]

1413
01:13:42,759 --> 01:13:44,166
Are you ready, mom?

1414
01:13:44,185 --> 01:13:46,644
Yeah, baby, we're going soon.

1415
01:13:48,023 --> 01:13:49,355
[sighs]

1416
01:13:49,507 --> 01:13:51,691
We're not gonna miss this place.

1417
01:13:51,842 --> 01:13:53,918
These people are never gonna
let up on us.

1418
01:13:53,936 --> 01:13:55,419
None of it matters
anyways, babe.

1419
01:13:55,421 --> 01:13:57,864
Let's leave it behind us, huh?

1420
01:13:57,940 --> 01:14:01,108
By the time we get to Alaska,
it'll be yesterday's news.

1421
01:14:01,261 --> 01:14:03,036
[engine starts]

1422
01:14:04,205 --> 01:14:06,664
[♪♪]

1423
01:14:15,124 --> 01:14:17,625
All right. Lower it.

1424
01:14:17,777 --> 01:14:19,886
Nice and easy.

1425
01:14:20,037 --> 01:14:22,055
[♪♪]

1426
01:14:29,138 --> 01:14:30,955
A little more.

1427
01:14:30,973 --> 01:14:33,524
Keep going.

1428
01:14:43,986 --> 01:14:46,079
Uh, we might have
something here, guys.

1429
01:14:46,155 --> 01:14:48,915
Tommy, uh, rotate left
a few degrees.

1430
01:14:48,991 --> 01:14:50,833
And a little closer.

1431
01:14:52,328 --> 01:14:54,712
Just a touch more.

1432
01:14:57,317 --> 01:14:59,592
[♪♪]

1433
01:15:02,322 --> 01:15:03,245
[Doug groans]

1434
01:15:03,264 --> 01:15:05,506
Antlers.

1435
01:15:05,658 --> 01:15:07,158
Nope.

1436
01:15:07,176 --> 01:15:09,936
Okay. Bring it up.
Let's move on.

1437
01:15:11,255 --> 01:15:12,991
The grueling search
for Erin corwin

1438
01:15:13,015 --> 01:15:15,666
Has been ongoing
for seven long weeks.

1439
01:15:15,685 --> 01:15:16,776
Hundreds of people

1440
01:15:16,927 --> 01:15:19,612
Covering 2,000 square miles
of the desert,

1441
01:15:19,689 --> 01:15:22,782
And, so far, not a trace
of the missing woman.

1442
01:15:22,859 --> 01:15:24,175
Authorities tell me

1443
01:15:24,193 --> 01:15:25,843
That they will
abandon the search

1444
01:15:25,862 --> 01:15:28,246
In 24 hours.

1445
01:15:34,704 --> 01:15:37,446
But you think Chris did it,
don't you?

1446
01:15:37,465 --> 01:15:39,373
He's still a suspect...

1447
01:15:39,525 --> 01:15:40,967
Yeah.

1448
01:15:41,043 --> 01:15:42,635
And if she doesn't turn up,

1449
01:15:42,786 --> 01:15:45,805
That son of a bitch is gonna get
away with it, isn't he?

1450
01:15:45,956 --> 01:15:47,031
Jon...

1451
01:15:47,049 --> 01:15:50,226
It's possible
we may never find her.

1452
01:15:57,301 --> 01:15:59,652
There's a few more mines
up in this region.

1453
01:15:59,803 --> 01:16:01,723
Tougher to get to,

Look, Doug.
You did your best.

Was I speeding?

1469
01:17:42,982 --> 01:17:43,831
Nope.

01:17:43,983 --> 01:17:45,499
Christopher lee,

1471
01:17:45,651 --> 01:17:48,410
You're under arrest

1472
01:17:48,429 --> 01:17:50,412

1485

I will admit,
this is a surprise.

1486
01:19:32,200 --> 01:19:35,851
So, is this place
really important to you?

1487
01:19:35,870 --> 01:19:37,286
I come here a lot.

1488
01:19:40,208 --> 01:19:41,707
[Erin chuckles]

1489
01:19:47,865 --> 01:19:49,382
Close your eyes.

1490
01:19:49,533 --> 01:19:50,791
[Erin laughs]

1491
01:19:50,943 --> 01:19:53,302
What're you doing, goofball?

1492
01:19:54,463 --> 01:19:56,472
Hey, I have a quick question.

1493
01:19:57,725 --> 01:20:00,643
What do you think
about the name "Sam"?

1494
01:20:02,045 --> 01:20:03,470
I don't like it.

1495
01:20:03,623 --> 01:20:05,213
Yeah.

1496
01:20:05,233 --> 01:20:07,233
Me neither. It's stupid.

1497

[Erin sighs]

1498
01:20:11,981 --> 01:20:13,739
Okay, can I open 'em yet?

1499
01:20:18,154 --> 01:20:19,303
Uh, Mr. Lee,

1500
01:20:19,321 --> 01:20:22,748
You have pled "not guilty"
to this crime.

1501
01:20:22,900 --> 01:20:23,974
Is that correct?

1502
01:20:23,993 --> 01:20:25,918
Yes, sir.

1503
01:20:37,932 --> 01:20:41,842
And you've, uh, you've taken
the stand here today

1504
01:20:41,994 --> 01:20:43,602
So that the jury can hear

1505
01:20:43,679 --> 01:20:45,679
That Erin corwin
gave you no choice

1506
01:20:45,831 --> 01:20:48,590
But to do
what you admit you did.

1507
01:20:48,609 --> 01:20:52,945
That it was
a spontaneous crime of passion,

1508
01:20:53,022 --> 01:20:55,448
And not a cold-blooded,
premeditated murder...

1509
01:20:55,599 --> 01:20:56,599
Is that correct?

1510
01:20:57,693 --> 01:20:59,869
She wanted to destroy my family.

1511
01:21:01,104 --> 01:21:02,680
Mr. Lee, uh...

1512
01:21:02,698 --> 01:21:03,864
[sighs]

1513
01:21:04,016 --> 01:21:05,349
Why were you driving with Erin

1514
01:21:05,367 --> 01:21:06,850
Out into the desert?

1515
01:21:06,869 --> 01:21:10,629
I wanted to talk to her
away from everything,

1516
01:21:10,706 --> 01:21:13,466
See if I could
talk some sense into her.

1517
01:21:13,542 --> 01:21:14,967
I wanted to tell her

1518
01:21:15,044 --> 01:21:17,470
That she and I were not
gonna end up together.

1519
01:21:17,621 --> 01:21:21,098
Were you, uh, able to get
through to her?

1520
01:21:22,551 --> 01:21:23,976
No.

1521
01:21:25,480 --> 01:21:28,889
It's quite a long drive
out into the desert, Mr. Lee.

1522
01:21:29,041 --> 01:21:30,057
God only knows

1523
01:21:30,209 --> 01:21:32,289
You had plenty of time
to make your case.

1524
01:21:33,062 --> 01:21:34,856
She was gonna destroy
me and my family,

1525
01:21:34,880 --> 01:21:36,304
And she didn't care.

1526
01:21:36,324 --> 01:21:38,824
She pushed me to a point
where I just snapped.

1527
01:21:40,310 --> 01:21:42,495
You blame Erin?

1528
01:21:43,739 --> 01:21:45,831
If she just listened
to reason...

1529
01:21:47,001 --> 01:21:49,335
I did what was necessary.

1530
01:21:51,172 --> 01:21:54,565

You pulled really, really hard?

Right?

1539
01:22:21,761 --> 01:22:22,926
Yes.

[prosecutor]
<i>only a few seconds have passed.</i>

1541
01:22:24,872 --> 01:22:26,688

could've stopped there, right?

01:22:26,707 --> 01:22:28,334
- No.

We're about, uh...
30 seconds in.

1546
01:22:34,048 --> 01:22:35,100
You could've stopped.

1547
01:22:35,124 --> 01:22:36,607
No.

1548
01:22:36,625 --> 01:22:38,942
<i>Now we're closing in

<i>She couldn't possibly</i>

Still be kicking at this point?

1551
01:22:41,055 --> 01:22:42,537
- You could've stopped.
- I couldn't.

1552
01:22:42,557 --> 01:22:44,609
Well, certainly,
once she stopped moving...

1553
01:22:44,633 --> 01:22:45,616
- <i>I couldn't stop.</i>
- Why not?

1554
01:22:45,618 --> 01:22:46,778
<i>Nothing could've stopped me</i>

1555
01:22:46,802 --> 01:22:48,452

Yet you were still pulling,

What was necessary...

1572
01:23:38,020 --> 01:23:41,930
To a 120-pound woman...

01:23:41,949 --> 01:23:46,267
Three weeks pregnant

1574

Like she was nothing
but a piece of trash.

<i>To collapse the mine</i>

1583
01:24:11,553 --> 01:24:14,462
<i>By using the propane tank

01:24:14,482 --> 01:24:17,391
<i>That would have definitely
destroyed the evidence,</i>

Yes.

And what exactly
did you do, Chris?

I asked for your permission
