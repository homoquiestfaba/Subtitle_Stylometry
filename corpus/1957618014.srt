00:00:27,068 --> 00:00:30,172
[subtle piano music]

4
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,931
- [Narrator] This is the
story about Christmas,

5
00:00:40,965 --> 00:00:43,034
the most special
time of the year,

6
00:00:44,931 --> 00:00:49,241
special for everybody in the
world, no matter who they are

7
00:00:49,275 --> 00:00:51,896
and this story happened
one Christmas Eve,

8
00:00:51,931 --> 00:00:56,551
a not so very long time ago,
far away in the mountains.

9
00:01:00,172 --> 00:01:03,586
[upbeat Christmas music]

10
00:01:18,896 --> 00:01:21,965
[subtle piano music]

11
00:01:30,758 --> 00:01:33,413
Now in this Christmas
story, there was a bear,

12
00:01:33,448 --> 00:01:38,448
and a raccoon, and a cougar,
and wolves, and a linx,

13
00:01:39,620 --> 00:01:41,551
and a fox, and a dog,
and a little girl.

14
00:01:45,241 --> 00:01:47,103
But I'm getting ahead of myself.

15
00:01:48,172 --> 00:01:49,586
Let's start at the beginning.

16
00:01:52,034 --> 00:01:55,344
It was a very cold day
that day before Christmas.

17
00:02:02,172 --> 00:02:03,931
Most of the animals
in the forest

18
00:02:03,965 --> 00:02:06,379
were busy getting ready
for that special day.

19
00:02:11,827 --> 00:02:13,241
Some more than others,

20
00:02:19,655 --> 00:02:22,896
but this story didn't
happen until that night,

21
00:02:22,931 --> 00:02:26,379
when a little girl read about
it in a magic storybook.

22
00:02:31,068 --> 00:02:34,103
The little girl's
name was Chrissy,

23
00:02:34,137 --> 00:02:36,758
she had just gone to
bed on Christmas Eve,

24
00:02:36,793 --> 00:02:40,413
but something very special
was about to happen to her.

25
00:02:40,448 --> 00:02:42,206
That was the Christmas
Eve she discovered

26
00:02:42,241 --> 00:02:44,931
The Magic Storybook.

27
00:02:46,137 --> 00:02:47,448
- [Child] Did you see that?

28
00:02:48,793 --> 00:02:50,000
- [Narrator] Well, actually

29
00:02:50,034 --> 00:02:51,586
The Magic Storybook
discovered her.

30
00:02:53,724 --> 00:02:55,758
- [Child] Check that out.

31
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,103
- [Child] Hey, it
jumped up on the bed.

32
00:03:01,137 --> 00:03:03,586
- [Narrator] The little
stuffed animals were right,

33
00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:06,310
The Magic Storybook
jumped right up on the bed

34
00:03:06,344 --> 00:03:08,448
and touched Chrissy on the nose.

35
00:03:08,482 --> 00:03:10,724
"How very strange" she thought.

36
00:03:10,758 --> 00:03:13,793
Well, she just had to
read it, wouldn't you?

37
00:03:13,827 --> 00:03:17,344
So Chrissy opened the book
up and read the first story

38
00:03:19,551 --> 00:03:22,896
and the first story was
Winslow, The Christmas Bear.

39
00:03:30,931 --> 00:03:33,862
It was just as Christmas
Eve day was beginning.

40
00:03:33,896 --> 00:03:36,034
It was very cold that morning,

41
00:03:36,068 --> 00:03:38,655
but the cold wasn't why
Winslow the bear wasn't asleep

42
00:03:38,689 --> 00:03:41,241
like all the other
bears in the forest.

43
00:03:41,275 --> 00:03:43,413
Winslow couldn't sleep.

44
00:03:43,448 --> 00:03:45,103
He was supposed to be sleeping.

45
00:03:45,137 --> 00:03:47,620
That's what bears do in
the winter, you know?

46
00:03:47,655 --> 00:03:49,931
But Winslow was much too excited

47
00:03:49,965 --> 00:03:52,724
to even think about
closing his eyes.

48
00:03:52,758 --> 00:03:56,655
You see, Winslow is quite
different from other bears.

49
00:03:56,689 --> 00:03:59,517
Winslow thought about
things very carefully

50
00:03:59,551 --> 00:04:02,620
and one of the things he
thought the most about

51
00:04:02,655 --> 00:04:04,137
was Christmas.

52
00:04:04,172 --> 00:04:07,586
- [Winslow] I wonder what
Christmas is really like.

53
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:09,137
- [Narrator] That's what
Winslow asked himself

54
00:04:09,172 --> 00:04:12,241
because he really
wanted to know.

55
00:04:12,275 --> 00:04:15,310
- [Winslow] Well, I can't
find out if I'm sleeping.

56
00:04:15,344 --> 00:04:16,655
- [Narrator] Of
course he was right.

57
00:04:16,689 --> 00:04:18,931
He couldn't find out
if he was sleeping.

58
00:04:18,965 --> 00:04:22,103
So that morning, Winslow
had decided to find out

59
00:04:22,137 --> 00:04:23,965
what Christmas really was

60
00:04:26,206 --> 00:04:28,137
and that's exactly what he did.

61
00:04:29,482 --> 00:04:32,068
- [Winslow] My, it's
awfully quiet this morning.

62
00:04:32,103 --> 00:04:33,965
I haven't seen anybody.

63
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,137
Oh, it's Wild Bill the Buffalo.

64
00:04:37,172 --> 00:04:40,413
Hey Wild Bill, I want
to ask you a question.

65
00:04:42,413 --> 00:04:44,724
Oh, the river sure is wide here.

66
00:04:44,758 --> 00:04:46,827
How am I going to get across?

67
00:04:46,862 --> 00:04:49,344
I need to ask Wild
Bill what Christmas is.

68
00:04:50,517 --> 00:04:53,551
Oh, it's hard to
walk on this long.

69
00:04:53,586 --> 00:04:55,034
I can't, whoa, whoa.

70
00:04:58,413 --> 00:05:00,275
That water is cold.

71
00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:02,931
Wild Bill, it's me Winslow.

72
00:05:02,965 --> 00:05:04,413
Oh, wait Wild Bill.

73
00:05:04,448 --> 00:05:05,655
Wait, I need to ask you.

74
00:05:06,827 --> 00:05:07,655
Please don't go.

75
00:05:08,793 --> 00:05:10,689
I need to know
what Christmas is.

76
00:05:11,551 --> 00:05:13,448
Oh, that water is cold.

77
00:05:14,344 --> 00:05:17,034
Oh no, he's gone.

78
00:05:17,068 --> 00:05:18,379
Who can I ask now?

79
00:05:19,724 --> 00:05:21,724
- [Narrator] Winslow
thought about it.

80
00:05:21,758 --> 00:05:22,896
What should he do?

81
00:05:22,931 --> 00:05:24,413
Who should he ask?

82
00:05:24,448 --> 00:05:26,586
- [Winslow] I bet my
friend Roger Raccoon

83
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:28,758
would know what Christmas is.

84
00:05:28,793 --> 00:05:30,689
I'll go ask him.

85
00:05:30,724 --> 00:05:32,931
- [Narrator] And that's
exactly what he did.

86
00:05:44,034 --> 00:05:46,448
After Winslow had been
traveling quite a while,

87
00:05:46,482 --> 00:05:48,551
he came upon a fallen
tree in the forest

88
00:05:48,586 --> 00:05:50,310
and started over it.

89
00:05:50,344 --> 00:05:53,275
It was right then that
he saw his friend, Roger.

90
00:05:53,310 --> 00:05:56,448
Now, Roger a very
busy little raccoon.

91
00:05:56,482 --> 00:05:59,068
He was gathering food
on this cold winter day,

92
00:05:59,103 --> 00:06:01,275
busy, busy, busy.

93
00:06:01,310 --> 00:06:02,551
- [Winslow] Hi Roger.

94
00:06:02,586 --> 00:06:04,206
- [Roger] Hey Winslow,
what are you doing up?

95
00:06:04,241 --> 00:06:06,310
Bears aren't supposed to
be awake during the winter.

96
00:06:06,344 --> 00:06:08,620
You're supposed to be
in your cave asleep.

97
00:06:08,655 --> 00:06:09,827
- [Winslow] I know,

98
00:06:09,862 --> 00:06:12,000
but I want to find
out what Christmas is.

99
00:06:12,034 --> 00:06:14,862
- [Roger] You don't
know what Christmas is?

100
00:06:14,896 --> 00:06:16,172
How very strange.

101
00:06:16,206 --> 00:06:18,172
- [Winslow] That's
why I came to visit.

102
00:06:18,206 --> 00:06:20,724
I thought that maybe
you could tell me.

103
00:06:20,758 --> 00:06:21,931
- [Roger] Well, I really
don't have a lot of time

104
00:06:21,965 --> 00:06:23,655
to talk right now
because I'm very busy.

105
00:06:23,689 --> 00:06:24,931
See, busy?

106
00:06:24,965 --> 00:06:26,344
But if you want to
know what I think,

107
00:06:26,379 --> 00:06:30,413
I think Christmas is
food, good things to eat.

108
00:06:30,448 --> 00:06:33,103
Yeah, that's what it
is all right, food.

109
00:06:33,137 --> 00:06:34,379
- [Narrator] Roger
kept gathering up

110
00:06:34,413 --> 00:06:36,965
all the small nuts and
berries he could find.

111
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,103
Winslow thought very
hard for a moment

112
00:06:40,137 --> 00:06:42,241
about what Roger had said.

113
00:06:42,275 --> 00:06:45,172
- [Roger] Look, if
you don't believe me,

114
00:06:45,206 --> 00:06:46,724
why don't you go
ask Frieda the Fox?

115
00:06:46,758 --> 00:06:49,034
She's very clever, I
bet she could help you.

116
00:06:50,413 --> 00:06:52,448
- [Winslow] That's a good idea.

117
00:06:52,482 --> 00:06:54,241
- [Roger] But you better
be careful Winslow.

118
00:06:54,275 --> 00:06:56,482
- [Winslow] Well,
why do you say that?

119
00:06:56,517 --> 00:06:58,551
- [Roger] Cause the
wolf family is out

120
00:06:58,586 --> 00:07:01,620
and you don't want to end up
being their supper, do you?

121
00:07:01,655 --> 00:07:03,172
- [Winslow] No, I guess I don't.

122
00:07:03,206 --> 00:07:05,068
Thanks for telling me, Roger.

123
00:07:05,103 --> 00:07:06,862
- [Roger] Any time fuzz brain.

124
00:07:06,896 --> 00:07:08,586
Don't take any chances.

125
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:10,655
- [Winslow] I'm
going to see Frieda.

126
00:07:10,689 --> 00:07:13,793
- [Narrator] And that's
exactly what he did.

127
00:07:13,827 --> 00:07:15,862
Winslow didn't really
think about the wolves

128
00:07:15,896 --> 00:07:18,655
as he walked away, he was
too busy trying to decide

129
00:07:18,689 --> 00:07:20,448
what to ask Frieda the Fox.

130
00:07:22,655 --> 00:07:25,413
But the wolves were
out that Christmas Eve

131
00:07:25,448 --> 00:07:28,034
and they were
looking for Winslow.

132
00:07:28,068 --> 00:07:30,482
Winslow was walking right
through the very place

133
00:07:30,517 --> 00:07:32,689
where the wolf family lived.

134
00:07:32,724 --> 00:07:35,310
Winslow decided he'd
better be very careful

135
00:07:35,344 --> 00:07:37,206
because he didn't want
to end up as dinner

136
00:07:37,241 --> 00:07:39,000
for a pack of hungry wolves.

137
00:07:42,034 --> 00:07:44,000
Suddenly, there
was Frieda the Fox,

138
00:07:44,034 --> 00:07:45,931
Winslow's very good friend.

139
00:07:47,344 --> 00:07:50,517
- [Frieda] Oh my word, is
that Winslow the Bear I see?

140
00:07:50,551 --> 00:07:51,931
- [Winslow] It's me.

141
00:07:51,965 --> 00:07:54,448
I've come to ask you a
very important question.

142
00:07:54,482 --> 00:07:56,275
- [Frieda] What
important question?

143
00:07:56,310 --> 00:07:59,000
- [Winslow] I want to
know what Christmas is.

144
00:07:59,034 --> 00:08:01,482
Boy, your fur sure is soft.

145
00:08:01,517 --> 00:08:02,344
I'm sorry.

146
00:08:03,482 --> 00:08:05,206
Did I say something wrong?

147
00:08:05,241 --> 00:08:06,448
- [Frieda] You mean to tell me

148
00:08:06,482 --> 00:08:08,482
you came all this way
from your warm cave

149
00:08:08,517 --> 00:08:10,310
to ask me what Christmas is?

150
00:08:10,344 --> 00:08:12,931
That's easy, Christmas
is having fun.

151
00:08:12,965 --> 00:08:15,344
- [Winslow] Having fun,
that's what Christmas is?

152
00:08:15,379 --> 00:08:16,620
- [Frieda] Sure Winslow.

153
00:08:16,655 --> 00:08:18,103
I have the most wonderful time

154
00:08:18,137 --> 00:08:20,206
exploring and playing
in this thicket.

155
00:08:20,241 --> 00:08:22,379
There's so much to do and see.

156
00:08:22,413 --> 00:08:25,482
Besides, Christmas is the
happiest time of the year.

157
00:08:25,517 --> 00:08:27,241
- [Winslow] So
Christmas is having fun.

158
00:08:27,275 --> 00:08:28,517
Can't you stand still?

159
00:08:28,551 --> 00:08:30,551
- [Frieda] Can't, no
fun to stand around

160
00:08:30,586 --> 00:08:32,931
and having fun is the
most important thing.

161
00:08:32,965 --> 00:08:34,896
- [Narrator] As
soon as she said it,

162
00:08:34,931 --> 00:08:38,689
Frieda became a bundle of
energy running here and there

163
00:08:38,724 --> 00:08:41,275
while poor Winslow could
hardly even follow her.

164
00:08:41,310 --> 00:08:43,517
He tried to stop
her with his paw,

165
00:08:43,551 --> 00:08:45,172
but she was much too quick.

166
00:08:45,206 --> 00:08:47,689
- [Frieda] I know who else
you could ask, Winslow.

167
00:08:47,724 --> 00:08:49,931
You could ask cranky old
Wilford the Wolverine.

168
00:08:49,965 --> 00:08:51,344
- [Winslow] I could, couldn't I?

169
00:08:51,379 --> 00:08:53,517
I'll just go ask old Wilford.

170
00:08:53,551 --> 00:08:54,862
Thank you, Frieda.

171
00:08:54,896 --> 00:08:55,689
- [Frieda] You're welcome.

172
00:08:55,724 --> 00:08:56,551
And Winslow?

173
00:08:56,586 --> 00:08:57,793
- [Winslow] Yes?

174
00:08:57,827 --> 00:08:58,965
- [Frieda] There's
one more thing.

175
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,379
- [Winslow] What's that, Frieda?

176
00:09:00,413 --> 00:09:01,827
- [Frieda] Be very careful.

177
00:09:01,862 --> 00:09:03,862
The wolf family's looking
for Christmas dinner

178
00:09:03,896 --> 00:09:06,413
and you don't want to be
the main course, do you?

179
00:09:06,448 --> 00:09:07,586
- [Winslow] No, I don't.

180
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:08,827
I'll be careful.

181
00:09:08,862 --> 00:09:10,206
- [Frieda] Have a
merry Christmas.

182
00:09:10,241 --> 00:09:11,689
- [Winslow] Thank you very much.

183
00:09:11,724 --> 00:09:13,586
I will, I think.

184
00:09:14,793 --> 00:09:16,379
- [Frieda] Winslow is
such a funny old bear.

185
00:09:16,413 --> 00:09:18,275
I hope he's okay.

186
00:09:18,310 --> 00:09:19,862
- [Narrator] Frieda was right.

187
00:09:19,896 --> 00:09:22,344
The wolf family was
lurking around the forest

188
00:09:22,379 --> 00:09:25,689
on that Christmas Eve and
they were looking for Winslow.

189
00:09:25,724 --> 00:09:28,448
Chrissy put down the book
for a moment, concerned.

190
00:09:28,482 --> 00:09:30,413
The wolves made her
afraid for Winslow.

191
00:09:30,448 --> 00:09:32,103
What could he do?

192
00:09:32,137 --> 00:09:33,724
She hoped he'd be all right.

193
00:09:35,448 --> 00:09:38,034
On his way, Winslow
got a little lost

194
00:09:38,068 --> 00:09:40,896
so he stopped to ask
directions from a fisher.

195
00:09:40,931 --> 00:09:43,931
Dolly was in a tree, so
Winslow poked his nose

196
00:09:43,965 --> 00:09:45,241
right up in the branches.

197
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,275
- [Winslow] Hello Dolly.

198
00:09:48,310 --> 00:09:50,827
Can you tell me how
to get to the meadow?

199
00:09:50,862 --> 00:09:52,551
- [Dolly] Sure
Winslow, it's that way

200
00:09:52,586 --> 00:09:55,275
down in the valley
by the big trees.

201
00:09:55,310 --> 00:09:57,827
Hey, what are you
doing here anyway?

202
00:09:57,862 --> 00:09:59,241
- [Winslow] Looking for Wilford.

203
00:09:59,275 --> 00:10:00,413
Thank you, Dolly.

204
00:10:04,724 --> 00:10:07,172
- [Narrator] Winslow had
to travel for a long way

205
00:10:07,206 --> 00:10:09,965
because the valley in the
mountains was quite large.

206
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,103
Sometimes he had to
squeeze his big bear body

207
00:10:13,137 --> 00:10:15,206
through very small openings,

208
00:10:15,241 --> 00:10:17,034
but that didn't stop Winslow

209
00:10:17,068 --> 00:10:20,586
because he really wanted
to know what Christmas was.

210
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:22,103
As he traveled, as he traveled,

211
00:10:22,137 --> 00:10:23,586
he thought to himself

212
00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:26,241
that maybe he shouldn't have
left his nice warm cave.

213
00:10:26,275 --> 00:10:28,103
Just like everybody said,

214
00:10:28,137 --> 00:10:30,379
bears weren't supposed
to be out on Christmas.

215
00:10:30,413 --> 00:10:31,379
Maybe they were right.

216
00:10:31,413 --> 00:10:33,068
But then he thought.

217
00:10:33,103 --> 00:10:36,310
- [Winslow] Well how will
I know if I don't find out?

218
00:10:36,344 --> 00:10:38,206
- [Narrator] And so,
he kept on going.

219
00:10:43,551 --> 00:10:45,034
- [Oliver] Here I go.

220
00:10:45,068 --> 00:10:47,586
Gotta get in the water.

221
00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:49,655
Ah, the big splash, yeah!

222
00:10:51,586 --> 00:10:53,689
Oh yeah, Geronimo!

223
00:10:53,724 --> 00:10:54,517
Woo!

224
00:10:57,344 --> 00:10:59,586
Great day for a swim.

225
00:11:00,827 --> 00:11:02,310
- [Narrator] Winslow
was hurrying along

226
00:11:02,344 --> 00:11:04,551
when he heard Oliver, the
quick little river otter,

227
00:11:04,586 --> 00:11:08,344
having the time of his life
swimming in the mountain stream.

228
00:11:08,379 --> 00:11:10,862
Oliver was one of
Winslow's best friends

229
00:11:10,896 --> 00:11:15,000
and oh, how Oliver loved to
dive and play in the water

230
00:11:15,034 --> 00:11:18,034
during the winter because
an otter and water

231
00:11:18,068 --> 00:11:21,310
just go together, even
in a cold winter stream.

232
00:11:29,206 --> 00:11:30,448
Winslow was going along

233
00:11:30,482 --> 00:11:32,862
as fast as his bear
legs could carry him

234
00:11:32,896 --> 00:11:34,620
when he finally saw Oliver.

235
00:11:36,275 --> 00:11:37,517
- [Oliver] Wee!

236
00:11:38,724 --> 00:11:40,310
- [Winslow] There's Oliver now.

237
00:11:40,344 --> 00:11:41,896
Hello Oliver.

238
00:11:41,931 --> 00:11:44,310
- [Oliver] Hey
Winslow, is that you?

239
00:11:44,344 --> 00:11:46,620
- [Winslow] Oliver Otter,
what are you doing?

240
00:11:46,655 --> 00:11:48,965
- [Oliver] Well, I'm
not getting dry cleaned.

241
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,137
- [Winslow] Oh, isn't that cold?

242
00:11:52,172 --> 00:11:53,724
- [Oliver] Otters love water.

243
00:11:53,758 --> 00:11:56,551
We have very heavy fur coats
and water can't get through.

244
00:11:56,586 --> 00:11:59,689
Hey, why aren't you asleep in
your cave with your mother?

245
00:11:59,724 --> 00:12:03,310
- [Winslow] Oh, I'm asking
everyone what Christmas is.

246
00:12:03,344 --> 00:12:04,620
- [Oliver] What Christmas is?

247
00:12:04,655 --> 00:12:06,586
Christmas is getting
everything that's good.

248
00:12:06,620 --> 00:12:08,551
Don't you know that, bear brain?

249
00:12:08,586 --> 00:12:11,068
- [Winslow] Christmas
is all those things?

250
00:12:11,103 --> 00:12:12,758
I don't understand.

251
00:12:12,793 --> 00:12:14,137
- [Oliver] Christmas
is whatever good thing

252
00:12:14,172 --> 00:12:15,379
you want it to be.

253
00:12:15,413 --> 00:12:17,068
I thought everybody knew that.

254
00:12:17,103 --> 00:12:19,137
- [Winslow] Well,
I didn't know that.

255
00:12:19,172 --> 00:12:20,344
- [Oliver] That's because bears

256
00:12:20,379 --> 00:12:22,344
are supposed to be
asleep in the winter.

257
00:12:22,379 --> 00:12:24,034
Boy, are you slow.

258
00:12:24,068 --> 00:12:26,965
Besides, bears aren't meant
to celebrate Christmas.

259
00:12:29,310 --> 00:12:30,758
- [Winslow] What's so funny?

260
00:12:30,793 --> 00:12:34,034
- [Oliver] Oh, the
snow tickles my back.

261
00:12:34,068 --> 00:12:36,689
Winslow, bears hibernate
during the winter,

262
00:12:36,724 --> 00:12:39,034
they don't have to
worry about Christmas.

263
00:12:39,068 --> 00:12:41,482
- [Winslow] I thought
Christmas was for everybody.

264
00:12:41,517 --> 00:12:43,724
- [Oliver] I don't think
Christmas is for bears.

265
00:12:43,758 --> 00:12:47,448
In fact, I don't think any bear
has even tried to find out.

266
00:12:47,482 --> 00:12:49,000
- [Narrator] That
was news to Winslow.

267
00:12:49,034 --> 00:12:51,103
He didn't want to do
anything he shouldn't.

268
00:12:51,137 --> 00:12:53,793
- [Winslow] I didn't know
I wasn't supposed to.

269
00:12:53,827 --> 00:12:56,827
- [Oliver] Hey,
where are you going?

270
00:12:56,862 --> 00:12:59,310
- [Winslow] Well, I guess
I better go back home.

271
00:12:59,344 --> 00:13:00,655
- [Oliver] Gee, now
that you're here,

272
00:13:00,689 --> 00:13:02,517
you might as well go
and ask old Wilford,

273
00:13:02,551 --> 00:13:03,931
even though he is pretty cranky

274
00:13:03,965 --> 00:13:05,724
about these things sometimes.

275
00:13:05,758 --> 00:13:07,206
- [Winslow] Oh, that's true.

276
00:13:07,241 --> 00:13:10,310
But maybe I'll just ask him,
as long as I've come this far.

277
00:13:10,344 --> 00:13:12,620
- [Oliver] Good idea, fur face.

278
00:13:12,655 --> 00:13:16,206
Take care of yourself and have
a merry Christmas Winslow.

279
00:13:16,241 --> 00:13:17,931
- [Winslow] Thank you.

280
00:13:17,965 --> 00:13:19,206
I will, I hope.

281
00:13:20,620 --> 00:13:21,793
- [Narrator] And with that,

282
00:13:21,827 --> 00:13:23,000
Oliver plopped into the
icy cold water again

283
00:13:23,034 --> 00:13:25,000
and swam to the other shore.

284
00:13:26,793 --> 00:13:28,448
As Winslow watched Oliver go,

285
00:13:28,482 --> 00:13:30,793
he thought about those
hungry wolves again

286
00:13:30,827 --> 00:13:34,034
and his very big bear
heart gave a thump.

287
00:13:37,379 --> 00:13:38,896
Oliver hopped out of the water

288
00:13:38,931 --> 00:13:41,655
and started scurrying here
and there up the hill,

289
00:13:41,689 --> 00:13:43,758
in and out.

290
00:13:43,793 --> 00:13:45,241
It was Christmas
Eve and of course,

291
00:13:45,275 --> 00:13:46,862
Oliver had a great
many things to do

292
00:13:46,896 --> 00:13:48,068
before the big day came.

293
00:13:51,482 --> 00:13:54,241
So Winslow the Bear
continued his journey

294
00:13:54,275 --> 00:13:56,448
on that Christmas Eve day.

295
00:13:56,482 --> 00:14:00,241
He was thinking about all the
things he'd learned so far.

296
00:14:00,275 --> 00:14:03,379
Roger had told him
Christmas was about food.

297
00:14:03,413 --> 00:14:06,586
Frieda said that Christmas
was exploring new things.

298
00:14:06,620 --> 00:14:07,965
Oliver told him that Christmas

299
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,000
was just what you
want to make it.

300
00:14:11,034 --> 00:14:13,310
Poor Winslow was so confused.

301
00:14:13,344 --> 00:14:14,793
He didn't know what to think.

302
00:14:14,827 --> 00:14:16,034
Who was right?

303
00:14:16,068 --> 00:14:18,000
Then, just as
Winslow was wondering

304
00:14:18,034 --> 00:14:20,241
about all those things
His friends had told him,

305
00:14:20,275 --> 00:14:23,517
he saw old Wilford
the Wolverine.

306
00:14:23,551 --> 00:14:26,896
He certainly did look
cranky, Winslow had to admit.

307
00:14:26,931 --> 00:14:29,275
At first, he didn't think
he was going to say anything

308
00:14:29,310 --> 00:14:30,517
to the cranky old Wilford,

309
00:14:30,551 --> 00:14:33,241
but then his curiosity
about Christmas

310
00:14:33,275 --> 00:14:35,241
got the better of him.

311
00:14:35,275 --> 00:14:36,275
- [Winslow] Hello Wilford.

312
00:14:36,310 --> 00:14:37,793
- [Wilford] What do you want?

313
00:14:37,827 --> 00:14:39,965
Haven't got time to dilly
dally with the likes of you.

314
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,517
Things to do, places to go.

315
00:14:41,551 --> 00:14:43,137
- [Winslow] I'm
sorry to bother you.

316
00:14:43,172 --> 00:14:45,827
I was just wandering
what Christmas was.

317
00:14:45,862 --> 00:14:47,103
- [Wilford] That's a
pretty silly question,

318
00:14:47,137 --> 00:14:48,137
what Christmas is.

319
00:14:48,172 --> 00:14:50,137
[mumbling]

320
00:14:50,172 --> 00:14:53,103
What do you want
to know for anyway?

321
00:14:53,137 --> 00:14:55,517
You're a bear, bears
don't have Christmas.

322
00:14:55,551 --> 00:14:57,586
You're supposed to be
asleep during Christmas.

323
00:14:57,620 --> 00:14:59,689
- [Winslow] Well, I
wasn't very tired.

324
00:14:59,724 --> 00:15:02,965
Everybody says Christmas
is something different

325
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,034
and I was hoping
you could tell me.

326
00:15:05,068 --> 00:15:06,310
- [Wilford] Don't
have time for this.

327
00:15:06,344 --> 00:15:08,517
Christmas is a waste of
time, that's what it is.

328
00:15:08,551 --> 00:15:11,413
- [Winslow] Well there must be
something you could tell me.

329
00:15:11,448 --> 00:15:12,482
- [Wilford] I could tell
you a lot of things,

330
00:15:12,517 --> 00:15:14,310
but I don't want to.

331
00:15:14,344 --> 00:15:17,137
Not my job to tell every
fuzz ball that comes along

332
00:15:17,172 --> 00:15:19,068
what Christmas is, not my job.

333
00:15:19,103 --> 00:15:20,724
- [Winslow] Well, could
you give me a hint?

334
00:15:20,758 --> 00:15:22,620
I won't bother you anymore.

335
00:15:22,655 --> 00:15:23,896
- [Wilford] Too late,

336
00:15:23,931 --> 00:15:25,379
this is all a lot of
bother and bladder,

337
00:15:25,413 --> 00:15:28,827
bother and bladder, bother and
bladder, that's what it is.

338
00:15:28,862 --> 00:15:30,310
No time for this.

339
00:15:30,344 --> 00:15:32,827
- [Narrator] Said Wilford and
he was gone just like that.

340
00:15:32,862 --> 00:15:35,965
Winslow just sat there
more confused than ever.

341
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,517
That didn't sound
like the Christmas

342
00:15:37,551 --> 00:15:38,827
he'd always heard about.

343
00:15:38,862 --> 00:15:41,620
- [Winslow] I'll just go
ask someone else then.

344
00:15:41,655 --> 00:15:43,482
- [Narrator] He said to
himself as he trotted away

345
00:15:43,517 --> 00:15:45,896
and that's exactly what he did.

366
00:17:06,448 --> 00:17:07,965
Winslow didn't know it,

367
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,413
but everyone in the forest
had heard about his story

368
00:17:12,344 --> 00:17:13,620
and they were all wondering

369
00:17:13,655 --> 00:17:16,413
if Winslow would
really find his answer.

370
00:17:16,448 --> 00:17:20,724
Everyone was interested,
but some more than others.

371
00:17:20,758 --> 00:17:23,103
The wolf family was
also very interested

372
00:17:23,137 --> 00:17:24,379
in Winslow's journey.

373
00:17:24,413 --> 00:17:27,000
They had been following
him the whole time

374
00:17:27,034 --> 00:17:30,827
and soon now, they
would make their move.

375
00:17:30,862 --> 00:17:32,793
Winslow didn't even
know they were there

376
00:17:32,827 --> 00:17:35,103
as he looked around the valley.

377
00:17:35,137 --> 00:17:37,172
Meanwhile, while
he was on his way,

378
00:17:37,206 --> 00:17:40,551
Winslow ran into someone
else quite by accident.

379
00:17:40,586 --> 00:17:42,724
It was Larry the Mountain Linx.

380
00:17:42,758 --> 00:17:45,448
- [Winslow] Excuse me,
I'm sorry to interrupt,

381
00:17:45,482 --> 00:17:46,689
but I was just wondering

382
00:17:46,724 --> 00:17:49,517
if you could tell me
what Christmas is.

383
00:17:49,551 --> 00:17:50,724
- [Larry] Oh, hi Winslow.

384
00:17:50,758 --> 00:17:51,689
What are you doing up?

385
00:17:51,724 --> 00:17:52,931
- [Narrator] He was curious

386
00:17:52,965 --> 00:17:55,034
why a bear would be
up Christmas Eve.

387
00:17:55,068 --> 00:17:57,103
The little linx
was one of the most

388
00:17:57,137 --> 00:17:59,586
playful and happy
friends that Winslow had,

389
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:04,103
always running and climbing
and jumping every which way.

390
00:18:04,137 --> 00:18:07,344
He made Winslow tired
just to watch him.

391
00:18:07,379 --> 00:18:09,758
Sometimes he played with
his sister, Loretta.

392
00:18:09,793 --> 00:18:11,896
Sometimes he just ran
around by himself.

393
00:18:15,551 --> 00:18:17,482
Finally, he stopped
just long enough

394
00:18:17,517 --> 00:18:19,137
for Winslow to say something.

395
00:18:19,172 --> 00:18:21,379
- [Winslow] Do you
know what Christmas is?

396
00:18:21,413 --> 00:18:24,310
- [Larry] Sure, Christmas is
playing, plain and simple.

397
00:18:24,344 --> 00:18:27,206
- [Winslow] Christmas certainly
is different for everyone.

398
00:18:27,241 --> 00:18:28,586
- [Larry] Of course it is.

399
00:18:28,620 --> 00:18:30,310
It's the best time of the year.

400
00:18:30,344 --> 00:18:32,758
- [Narrator] Winslow realized
that every one of his friends

401
00:18:32,793 --> 00:18:36,931
had a very different idea
about Christmas, how confusing?

402
00:18:36,965 --> 00:18:38,379
He knew less now than he did

403
00:18:38,413 --> 00:18:40,275
when he was back in his cave.

404
00:18:40,310 --> 00:18:41,827
- [Larry] Aren't you gonna stay?

405
00:18:41,862 --> 00:18:45,275
- [Winslow] Can't, I think
I'll go ask Mother Cougar.

406
00:18:45,310 --> 00:18:48,068
She knows about everything
here in the forest.

407
00:18:48,103 --> 00:18:50,448
- [Larry] Winslow, you know
that the wolves are around,

408
00:18:50,482 --> 00:18:51,586
don't you?

409
00:18:51,620 --> 00:18:53,965
- [Winslow] Yes,
I've heard that.

410
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,413
- [Larry] Oh, everybody
says they're very hungry.

411
00:18:56,448 --> 00:18:58,068
The whole family
is running around

412
00:18:58,103 --> 00:19:00,000
looking for a big
Christmas dinner.

413
00:19:00,034 --> 00:19:02,000
- [Winslow] Thanks
for telling me.

414
00:19:02,034 --> 00:19:04,482
- [Larry] Oh, your very
welcome funny old bear.

415
00:19:04,517 --> 00:19:05,931
Merry Christmas.

416
00:19:11,068 --> 00:19:14,379
- [Narrator] Mother Cougar was
a very large mountain lion.

417
00:19:14,413 --> 00:19:15,862
She had lived in the forest

418
00:19:15,896 --> 00:19:19,000
longer than anyone could
remember, including Winslow.

419
00:19:19,034 --> 00:19:21,586
She knew everything.

420
00:19:21,620 --> 00:19:22,931
While Winslow looked for her,

421
00:19:22,965 --> 00:19:24,724
the wolves were getting closer.

422
00:19:24,758 --> 00:19:27,620
Now, Mother Cougar
liked to perch herself

423
00:19:27,655 --> 00:19:31,206
on the very highest peak so
that she could watch everything.

424
00:19:33,448 --> 00:19:34,655
But Winslow wasn't so sure

425
00:19:34,689 --> 00:19:36,448
that he wanted to
be up this high.

426
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,310
- [Winslow] Whoa, I
better be careful.

427
00:19:40,344 --> 00:19:45,137
I could fall a very long
way, that's real steep.

428
00:19:45,172 --> 00:19:47,655
Maybe I'll just go
around the easy path

429
00:19:47,689 --> 00:19:49,344
and talk to Mother Cougar.

430
00:19:53,448 --> 00:19:54,482
- [Mother] Winslow the
Bear, I thought it was you.

431
00:19:55,862 --> 00:19:57,482
What are you doing way up here?

432
00:19:58,827 --> 00:20:00,448
- [Winslow] Climbing.

433
00:20:00,482 --> 00:20:03,206
I'm just trying to get up
there to talk with you.

434
00:20:03,241 --> 00:20:06,827
- [Mother] And what on earth
are you doing up in the winter?

435
00:20:06,862 --> 00:20:09,034
- [Winslow] There's
something I need to ask you.

436
00:20:09,068 --> 00:20:11,034
- [Mother] You are
supposed to be sleeping,

437
00:20:11,068 --> 00:20:13,034
bears hibernate in the winter.

438
00:20:13,068 --> 00:20:16,206
- [Winslow] Yes, I know, but
I need to ask you something

439
00:20:16,241 --> 00:20:19,551
because you're the wisest
animal in the forest.

440
00:20:19,586 --> 00:20:20,931
What's Christmas?

441
00:20:20,965 --> 00:20:23,034
- [Mother] You got up
in the middle of winter

442
00:20:23,068 --> 00:20:25,206
to ask me that?

443
00:20:25,241 --> 00:20:26,413
- [Winslow] Yes I did.

444
00:20:26,448 --> 00:20:27,655
Do you know?

445
00:20:27,689 --> 00:20:28,586
- [Mother] Well,
of course I know.

446
00:20:28,620 --> 00:20:30,275
Christmas is singing.

447
00:20:30,310 --> 00:20:31,862
The humans call it caroling.

448
00:20:31,896 --> 00:20:35,241
I call it noise, but
that's what it is, singing.

449
00:20:35,275 --> 00:20:36,482
- [Winslow] Singing?

450
00:20:36,517 --> 00:20:38,344

getting up for, was it?

00:20:38,379 --> 00:20:39,551

left the mountain top.

Mother Cougar stood up on
the rock and watched him go,

468
00:21:18,448 --> 00:21:21,413
she was worried about
the funny old bear.

469
00:21:23,068 --> 00:21:24,758
- [Mother] Time for me to go to.

470
00:21:24,793 --> 00:21:27,379
Can't leave the children
too long, you know?

471
00:21:27,413 --> 00:21:28,931
- [Narrator] As she left,

472
00:21:28,965 --> 00:21:31,206
the father of the wolf family,
Willard, watched her run off.

473
00:21:33,965 --> 00:21:35,275
Then he followed.

474
00:21:38,724 --> 00:21:40,689
Chrissy was afraid for Winslow.

475
00:21:40,724 --> 00:21:44,517
She scrunched up her pillow
so it was just right.

476
00:21:46,310 --> 00:21:47,655
Then she kept on reading.

477
00:21:50,206 --> 00:21:52,344
Now, after Winslow
left the mountain top,

478
00:21:52,379 --> 00:21:53,896
he went into the valley thicket

479
00:21:53,931 --> 00:21:56,724
to see who else he could find
to talk to about Christmas.

480
00:21:57,827 --> 00:21:58,862
Wait a minute.

481
00:21:58,896 --> 00:22:00,310
Someone was in the thicket.

482
00:22:01,517 --> 00:22:04,103
Why it's Kenneth, the
crafty little coyote.

483
00:22:06,413 --> 00:22:07,689
- [Winslow] I'll just say hello.

484
00:22:07,724 --> 00:22:10,586
Kenneth, it's me, Winslow.

485
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:12,068
- [Narrator] But Kenneth
didn't hear Winslow

486
00:22:12,103 --> 00:22:16,965
and off he went every which
way, here, there, everywhere.

487
00:22:17,689 --> 00:22:18,172
- [Winslow] Hello?

488
00:22:18,206 --> 00:22:19,068
It's me.

489
00:22:23,896 --> 00:22:25,068

490
00:22:25,103 --> 00:22:27,310
I can't go very fast, Kenneth.

491
00:22:27,344 --> 00:22:28,965
Could you slow down?

492
00:22:30,379 --> 00:22:32,275
- [Kenneth] Hey Winslow,
you wanna play tag?

493
00:22:32,310 --> 00:22:35,275
- [Winslow] Wait Kenneth,
I didn't come to play tag.

494
00:22:35,310 --> 00:22:37,655
I wanted to ask you something.

495
00:22:37,689 --> 00:22:40,448
- [Kenneth] I'm over
here buddy, come on.

496
00:22:40,482 --> 00:22:41,689
- [Winslow] Wait a minute.

497

Where are you?

499
00:22:44,172 --> 00:22:46,034
- [Kenneth] This way,
try and catch me.

500
00:22:46,068 --> 00:22:48,655
- [Winslow] But I can't
go as fast as you.

501
00:22:48,689 --> 00:22:49,689
Kenneth?

502
00:22:50,896 --> 00:22:53,724
Kenneth, you're a
lot faster than me.

503
00:22:54,931 --> 00:22:57,103
- [Kenneth] Run again
Winslow, over here.

504
00:22:57,137 --> 00:22:58,793
- [Winslow] Please slow down.

505
00:23:00,551 --> 00:23:03,413
Kenneth, hello?

506
00:23:03,448 --> 00:23:04,448
Boy, he's sure fast.

507
00:23:05,448 --> 00:23:06,758
- [Narrator] Poor Winslow,

508
00:23:06,793 --> 00:23:08,655
every time he got
close to the coyote,

509
00:23:08,689 --> 00:23:11,379
Kenneth would just zip
off in another direction.

510
00:23:11,413 --> 00:23:14,310
He just couldn't get that
coyote to stop for a minute.

511
00:23:14,344 --> 00:23:17,517
Winslow went on searching
for the longest time,

512
00:23:17,551 --> 00:23:19,068
but he didn't find Kenneth.

513
00:23:32,344 --> 00:23:35,965
Just then, Winslow heard
the strangest sound.

514
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,655
[poking sounds]

515
00:23:44,068 --> 00:23:46,724
- [Porky] Oh no, don't eat
me, I don't taste good.

516
00:23:46,758 --> 00:23:47,724
Please don't eat me.

517
00:23:47,758 --> 00:23:49,172
You wouldn't like me.

518
00:23:49,206 --> 00:23:52,896
I'm all stringy and
tough and icky tasting.

519
00:23:52,931 --> 00:23:54,965
Get away, leave me alone!

520
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,206
Please let me go.

521
00:23:56,241 --> 00:23:58,000
- [Winslow] I'm not
going to eat you,

522
00:23:58,034 --> 00:24:00,000
slow down, it's okay.

523
00:24:00,034 --> 00:24:01,275
- [Porky] You wouldn't like me.

524
00:24:01,310 --> 00:24:04,172
Porcupines are real
bad nutritionally.

525
00:24:04,206 --> 00:24:05,862
I can see it in your eyes,

526
00:24:05,896 --> 00:24:07,758
you're gonna, you're
gonna gobble me down

527
00:24:07,793 --> 00:24:10,068
and spit out the needles.

528
00:24:10,103 --> 00:24:12,655
- [Winslow] I'm really not
going to eat you, Porky.

529
00:24:12,689 --> 00:24:15,068
I just wanted to
ask you a question.

530
00:24:15,103 --> 00:24:16,586
- [Winslow] Oh,
it's you Winslow.

531
00:24:16,620 --> 00:24:18,206
Oh man, am I glad it's you.

532
00:24:18,241 --> 00:24:20,620
I thought you were
one of the wolves,

533
00:24:20,655 --> 00:24:22,862
they'd make a
sandwich out of me.

534
00:24:22,896 --> 00:24:24,896
I'm so glad it's you instead.

535
00:24:24,931 --> 00:24:27,724
Don't ever sneak up on me again.

536
00:24:27,758 --> 00:24:29,172
You almost gave
me a heart attack,

537
00:24:29,206 --> 00:24:31,137
you fur covered bee bee brain.

538
00:24:31,172 --> 00:24:32,482
- [Winslow] I'm sorry.

539
00:24:32,517 --> 00:24:34,896
- [Narrator] Said
Winslow, and he was.

540
00:24:34,931 --> 00:24:37,586
Winslow decided maybe
he'd better not bother

541
00:24:37,620 --> 00:24:39,931
the frightened little
porcupine anymore.

542
00:24:39,965 --> 00:24:41,965
He'd just go ask someone else

543
00:24:43,655 --> 00:24:45,482
and that's exactly what he did.

544
00:24:50,862 --> 00:24:53,689
Winslow trudged down through
the snow covered mountains.

545
00:24:56,068 --> 00:24:57,241
While Winslow was asking

546
00:24:57,275 --> 00:24:59,034
all his animal friends
about Christmas,

547
00:24:59,068 --> 00:25:01,344
the day was passing quickly.

548
00:25:01,379 --> 00:25:03,758
Winslow was running
out of daylight.

549
00:25:03,793 --> 00:25:05,206
He had to hurry on his journey

550
00:25:05,241 --> 00:25:07,551
if he was going to
find out in time.

551
00:25:07,586 --> 00:25:11,068
He only had a few hours left
and then it would be night

552
00:25:12,344 --> 00:25:13,793
and then it would
be Christmas day

553
00:25:13,827 --> 00:25:17,000
and too late for anyone to tell
him, so he kept pushing on.

554
00:25:18,172 --> 00:25:19,586
He could see Eddie
the Great Eagle

555
00:25:19,620 --> 00:25:22,344
soaring high up in
the afternoon sky.

556
00:25:22,379 --> 00:25:24,344
Winslow was still
hoping that someone

557
00:25:24,379 --> 00:25:26,517
would have the answer
to his question

558
00:25:26,551 --> 00:25:30,551
before the day was over, then
something caught his ear.

559
00:25:31,827 --> 00:25:34,241
It was Sylvia,
the dancing skunk.

560
00:25:35,344 --> 00:25:37,517
She was very famous
in the forest.

561
00:25:37,551 --> 00:25:39,172
She danced very
well for a skunk.

562
00:25:41,655 --> 00:25:44,862
- [Winslow] Sylvia, does
Christmas mean dancing?

563
00:25:44,896 --> 00:25:48,241
- [Sylvia] No, Christmas is
about things that smell good.

564
00:25:48,275 --> 00:25:50,551
[laughter]

565
00:25:51,724 --> 00:25:55,034
What are you laughing
about banana nose?

566
00:25:56,413 --> 00:25:59,137
- [Winslow] A skunk that
likes things that smell good.

567
00:25:59,172 --> 00:26:03,482
- [Sylvia] Hey no neck,
you think that's funny?

568
00:26:03,517 --> 00:26:07,103
- [Winslow] I'm sorry, but
skunks don't smell good,

569
00:26:07,137 --> 00:26:08,620
they smell yucky.

570
00:26:10,413 --> 00:26:11,758
- [Sylvia] What you
know bear brain?

571
00:26:11,793 --> 00:26:14,586
You smell like an old fur coat.

572
00:26:14,620 --> 00:26:15,517
I'm outta here.

573
00:26:15,551 --> 00:26:17,896
Three, two, one, blast off.

574
00:26:19,482 --> 00:26:22,551
- [Winslow] Gosh, she's
real fast for a skunk.

575
00:26:22,586 --> 00:26:25,034
I guess I shouldn't
have laughed at her.

576
00:26:25,068 --> 00:26:28,517
I didn't even get to
ask her about Christmas.

577
00:26:28,551 --> 00:26:30,103
- [Narrator] Oh Winslow.

578
00:26:30,137 --> 00:26:32,655
It seemed he'd never
find out about Christmas.

579
00:26:35,862 --> 00:26:38,724
When suddenly he saw that
the entire wolf family

580
00:26:38,758 --> 00:26:40,551
was on the other
side of the valley.

581
00:26:41,724 --> 00:26:43,862
Oh, he was so scared,
he tried to climb a tree

582
00:26:43,896 --> 00:26:45,620
but it was too little.

583
00:26:45,655 --> 00:26:49,517
He tried to dig a hole, but
that didn't work either.

584
00:26:50,586 --> 00:26:53,000
The tree again, running
up the mountain,

585
00:26:56,482 --> 00:26:57,275
digging,

586
00:26:59,931 --> 00:27:01,586
nothing worked for Winslow.

587
00:27:04,689 --> 00:27:06,586
And they were on
their way toward him.

588
00:27:08,103 --> 00:27:11,241
No, no, no, he had to go!

589
00:27:11,275 --> 00:27:12,655
Here they come!

590
00:27:12,689 --> 00:27:15,206
- [Winslow] Oh no,
oh no, oh no, no.

591
00:27:16,655 --> 00:27:18,034
Wait, where did they go?

592
00:27:18,068 --> 00:27:20,655
I guess they weren't as
close as I thought they were.

593
00:27:22,862 --> 00:27:24,724
I better get out of here quick.

594
00:27:26,413 --> 00:27:28,482
- [Narrator] Winslow ran
to climb a bigger pine tree

595
00:27:28,517 --> 00:27:31,241
when he saw Bob the Bobcat.

596
00:27:31,275 --> 00:27:33,655
- [Winslow] Bob, can
I come up with you?

597
00:27:33,689 --> 00:27:35,310
- [Bob] What, are you crazy?

598
00:27:35,344 --> 00:27:37,482
There's no room for you up here.

599
00:27:37,517 --> 00:27:39,206
- [Winslow] I can't
stay down here.

600
00:27:39,241 --> 00:27:40,482
- [Bob] Winslow,
I'm telling you,

601
00:27:40,517 --> 00:27:42,413
you're too big for
this little tree.

602
00:27:42,448 --> 00:27:44,689
- [Winslow] Please, Bob.

603
00:27:44,724 --> 00:27:46,758
You won't even notice me.

604
00:27:50,172 --> 00:27:53,655
I'm sorry to intrude,
but I have to come up.

605
00:27:53,689 --> 00:27:55,172
- [Bob] Hey Winslow, you're
bigger than the whole tree.

606
00:27:55,206 --> 00:27:56,931
There ain't no room.

607
00:27:56,965 --> 00:27:58,344
Go find your own tree.

608
00:27:58,379 --> 00:27:59,931
Giant Redwood oughta do it.

609
00:27:59,965 --> 00:28:02,275
Come on Winslow,
beat it, beat it.

610
00:28:02,310 --> 00:28:03,551
- [Winslow] Oh, all right.

611
00:28:03,586 --> 00:28:06,068
You don't have to be
so cranky about it.

612
00:28:08,689 --> 00:28:09,689
I'm leaving.

613
00:28:12,862 --> 00:28:15,172
- [Bob] Hey, you better
hustle your bustle.

614
00:28:15,206 --> 00:28:16,517
Hurry Winslow, hurry.

615
00:28:16,551 --> 00:28:18,620
Hey look, don't walk, run, run.

616
00:28:20,068 --> 00:28:22,655
- [Winslow] I'm running
as fast as I can.

617
00:28:22,689 --> 00:28:24,482
Oh, there's a tree
that will hold me.

618
00:28:24,517 --> 00:28:25,965
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

619
00:28:28,103 --> 00:28:29,896
Higher, higher.

620
00:28:31,931 --> 00:28:36,172
I can't get a whole lot
higher, maybe just a little.

621
00:28:39,206 --> 00:28:40,413
- [Willard] I found him.

622
00:28:40,448 --> 00:28:41,862
Come on down from
there, Winslow.

623
00:28:41,896 --> 00:28:44,310
- [Winslow] Oh no, you
want to have me for dinner.

624
00:28:44,344 --> 00:28:45,344
- [Willard] What?

625
00:28:45,379 --> 00:28:46,172
Dinner?

626
00:28:46,206 --> 00:28:47,344
You?

627
00:28:47,379 --> 00:28:48,517
Where'd you get such an idea?

628
00:28:48,551 --> 00:28:51,379
Wolves don't eat bears,
nobody eats bears.

629
00:28:51,413 --> 00:28:53,620
We came to tell you
about Christmas.

630
00:28:53,655 --> 00:28:54,655
- [Winslow] You did?

631
00:28:54,689 --> 00:28:56,137
- [Willard] Why, sure we did.

632
00:28:56,172 --> 00:28:57,655
We heard what you were doing.

633
00:28:57,689 --> 00:28:59,448
We know what Christmas is.

634
00:28:59,482 --> 00:29:00,448
- [Winslow] You do?

635
00:29:00,482 --> 00:29:01,896
- [Willard] Course we do.

636
00:29:01,931 --> 00:29:04,068
If you weren't such afraid-y
bear, you'd know that.

637
00:29:04,103 --> 00:29:06,965
Now get your fur lined
carcass down out of that tree

638
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,275
and I'll tell ya.

639
00:29:08,310 --> 00:29:10,068
- [Winslow] Well, okay.

640
00:29:10,103 --> 00:29:12,310
- [Willard] Come on,
slide down there chubby.

641
00:29:12,344 --> 00:29:14,827
- [Winslow] Gee, I
better go kinda slow.

642
00:29:14,862 --> 00:29:17,103
That bark is rough.

643
00:29:17,137 --> 00:29:19,758
Wait Willard, wait for me.

644
00:29:19,793 --> 00:29:21,068
I do want to know.

645
00:29:21,103 --> 00:29:23,310
Please wait just a minute.

646
00:29:23,344 --> 00:29:26,310
Willard, can you tell
me what Christmas is?

647
00:29:26,344 --> 00:29:27,413
- [Willard] I'm
surprised you got up

648
00:29:27,448 --> 00:29:29,172
just for that in
the first place.

649
00:29:29,206 --> 00:29:32,000
- [Winslow] Well, I wanted
to know what Christmas is.

650
00:29:32,034 --> 00:29:33,655
Can you please tell me now?

651
00:29:33,689 --> 00:29:35,724
- [Willard] Yep, I
sure can, it's easy.

652
00:29:35,758 --> 00:29:37,172
- [Winslow] It is?

653
00:29:37,206 --> 00:29:39,275
- [Willard] Indeed-y,
Christmas is for families,

654
00:29:39,310 --> 00:29:40,689
that's what it is.

655
00:29:40,724 --> 00:29:42,172
It's our favorite time of year

656
00:29:42,206 --> 00:29:44,517
because we get to
spend it together.

657
00:29:44,551 --> 00:29:48,034
Yes siree, beg your britches,
Christmas is for families.

658
00:29:48,068 --> 00:29:50,827
- [Narrator] Winslow looked
and saw the happy wolf family

659
00:29:50,862 --> 00:29:53,206
running and playing
together on Christmas Eve.

660
00:29:53,241 --> 00:29:56,000
He had to admit, they
certainly looked happy.

661
00:29:56,034 --> 00:29:58,965
- [Winslow] Christmas is for
families, that's the answer?

662
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,379
- [Willard] Yes sir
bear, fact of the matter.

663
00:30:01,413 --> 00:30:04,931
Christmas is for families and
that's where you ought to be

664
00:30:04,965 --> 00:30:06,103
with your family.

665
00:30:06,137 --> 00:30:08,206
- [Winslow] Gee, why
didn't I think of that?

666
00:30:08,241 --> 00:30:10,448
Are you sure, Willard?

667
00:30:10,482 --> 00:30:12,517
- [Willard] Sure as
shooting, I'm sure.

668
00:30:12,551 --> 00:30:14,896
Ask Digby the Dog over
at the human's house.

669
00:30:14,931 --> 00:30:16,137
He'll tell ya.

670
00:30:16,172 --> 00:30:17,275
Gotta go now.

671
00:30:17,310 --> 00:30:19,517
Come on boys.

672
00:30:22,344 --> 00:30:24,206
- [Narrator] And with that,
Willard and his whole family

673
00:30:24,241 --> 00:30:27,241
ran up the side of the
mountain valley and were gone.

674
00:30:27,275 --> 00:30:30,310
So Winslow decided he'd
do what Willard suggested.

675
00:30:30,344 --> 00:30:33,482
He'd go ask Digby, the English
setter at the human's house.

676
00:30:33,517 --> 00:30:36,413
So many answers to
the same question.

677
00:30:36,448 --> 00:30:38,551
Christmas was different
for everybody.

678
00:30:38,586 --> 00:30:39,965
Oh, it was almost more

679
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,448
than Winslow's little
bear brain could handle.

680
00:30:47,689 --> 00:30:49,827
[barking]

681
00:30:51,620 --> 00:30:54,137
Now, as Winslow got close
to the human's house,

682
00:30:54,172 --> 00:30:55,448
he saw his friend Digby

683
00:30:55,482 --> 00:30:58,551
and oh, was Digby
happy to see him.

684
00:31:01,344 --> 00:31:02,862
- [Digby] Winslow, Winslow,

685
00:31:02,896 --> 00:31:05,724
I didn't think I'd
see you until Spring.

686
00:31:05,758 --> 00:31:07,379
Boy, is it good to see you.

687
00:31:07,413 --> 00:31:08,655
Boy oh boy.

688
00:31:08,689 --> 00:31:10,689
- [Narrator] And Winslow
liked seeing Digby too.

689
00:31:10,724 --> 00:31:13,413
They always had so
much fun together.

690
00:31:13,448 --> 00:31:15,551
The two friends
played and played

691
00:31:15,586 --> 00:31:18,034
until Winslow was very tired.

692
00:31:18,068 --> 00:31:21,586
Digby tried to get the
tired bear to keep playing,

693
00:31:21,620 --> 00:31:25,000
but Winslow just wanted to
lie in the snow for a minute

694
00:31:25,034 --> 00:31:26,206
and catch his breath.

695
00:31:27,379 --> 00:31:29,068
- [Digby] Come on,
Winslow, get up.

696
00:31:32,103 --> 00:31:35,241
- [Narrator] So Winslow
stood all the way up.

697
00:31:35,275 --> 00:31:37,344
- [Digby] What are you
doing here, Winslow?

698
00:31:37,379 --> 00:31:40,275
- [Winslow] Digby, I want
to know what Christmas is.

699
00:31:40,310 --> 00:31:41,724
Do you know?

700
00:31:41,758 --> 00:31:43,827
- [Digby] Do I know
what Christmas is?

701
00:31:43,862 --> 00:31:44,965
Sure, I know.

702
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,655
Christmas is for kids.

703
00:31:46,689 --> 00:31:49,068
- [Winslow] Kids, that's
what Christmas is?

704
00:31:49,103 --> 00:31:50,655
How do you know?

705
00:31:50,689 --> 00:31:53,000
- [Digby] Because that's what
it is around the human house.

706
00:31:53,034 --> 00:31:54,206
If you don't believe me,

707
00:31:54,241 --> 00:31:56,620
just go down and
ask my little girl.

708
00:31:56,655 --> 00:31:58,724
- [Winslow] You have
your own little girl?

709
00:31:58,758 --> 00:32:01,931
- [Digby] Yep, most dogs
have their own humans.

710
00:32:01,965 --> 00:32:04,931
She's in the house,
go on, ask her.

711
00:32:04,965 --> 00:32:08,620
- [Narrator] Well, Digby was
his friend, so it must be true.

712
00:32:08,655 --> 00:32:11,724
Winslow decided right
there and then, he'd do it.

713
00:32:11,758 --> 00:32:13,206
The house was just
down the hill.

714
00:32:13,241 --> 00:32:15,931
Digby and Winslow
had rested enough,

715
00:32:15,965 --> 00:32:18,103
time to go and ask
Digby's little girl

716
00:32:18,137 --> 00:32:21,000
and that's exactly what he did.

717
00:32:29,241 --> 00:32:30,862
Winslow had never seen anything

718
00:32:30,896 --> 00:32:32,931
like the human's house before.

719
00:32:32,965 --> 00:32:34,896
He was quite interested.

720
00:32:37,827 --> 00:32:40,931
He walked right up to the
front door of the house

721
00:32:40,965 --> 00:32:41,793
and went in.

722
00:32:46,068 --> 00:32:47,931
Meanwhile, Chrissy
heard something,

723
00:32:47,965 --> 00:32:51,620
so she put down The Magic
Storybook and went to look.

724
00:32:51,655 --> 00:32:53,137
What was it?

725
00:32:53,172 --> 00:32:56,758
Inside, Winslow thought that
the house was very wonderful.

726
00:32:56,793 --> 00:33:00,724
It was warm and so beautifully
decorated, and the tree,

727
00:33:00,758 --> 00:33:03,896
why this wasn't like any tree
he'd ever seen in the forest.

728
00:33:03,931 --> 00:33:05,655
It was a very special tree.

729
00:33:05,689 --> 00:33:09,413
It had colored lights and gaily
wrapped presents underneath

730
00:33:09,448 --> 00:33:10,931
and Winslow thought to himself

731
00:33:10,965 --> 00:33:14,068
that this must be
what Christmas was.

732
00:33:14,103 --> 00:33:15,310
Chrissy was so excited,

733
00:33:15,344 --> 00:33:17,448
she hurried downstairs
to see who it was.

734
00:33:17,482 --> 00:33:22,034
It was Winslow, the very bear
she'd been reading about.

735
00:33:22,068 --> 00:33:23,448
How wonderful?

736
00:33:23,482 --> 00:33:24,724
He'd come to see her.

737
00:33:24,758 --> 00:33:26,448
- [Chrissy] I know who you are.

738
00:33:26,482 --> 00:33:27,379
- [Narrator] Chrissy said.

739
00:33:27,413 --> 00:33:28,827
- [Chrissy] You're Winslow.

740
00:33:28,862 --> 00:33:31,586
- [Winslow] That's right,
my name is Winslow.

741
00:33:31,620 --> 00:33:33,793
I'm very pleased to meet you.

742
00:33:33,827 --> 00:33:35,034
- [Narrator] Chrissy
was delighted

743
00:33:35,068 --> 00:33:37,034
to have a new friend
on Christmas Eve.

744
00:33:37,068 --> 00:33:39,206
She told Winslow that she'd
been reading all about him

745
00:33:39,241 --> 00:33:40,724
in his adventure.

746
00:33:40,758 --> 00:33:43,620
Winslow was surprised that
she knew what he wanted.

747
00:33:43,655 --> 00:33:46,413
She showed Winslow
all the decorations

748
00:33:46,448 --> 00:33:49,482
and that funny old
bear even took one down

749
00:33:49,517 --> 00:33:51,103
and played with it on the floor.

750
00:33:52,758 --> 00:33:55,275
She offered him the
most scrumptious treat,

751
00:33:55,310 --> 00:33:57,896
a plate of her special
Christmas sugar cookies,

752
00:33:57,931 --> 00:34:00,896
which Winslow ate right up.

753
00:34:00,931 --> 00:34:02,689
- [Winslow] These
are really good.

754
00:34:02,724 --> 00:34:04,206
- [Narrator] She told Winslow

755
00:34:04,241 --> 00:34:06,413
about the Christmas tree in
their home and what it meant

756
00:34:06,448 --> 00:34:08,655
and that her family
celebrated Christmas

757
00:34:08,689 --> 00:34:11,137
the very same way every year.

758
00:34:11,172 --> 00:34:13,517
She said that everyone
was welcome on Christmas

759
00:34:13,551 --> 00:34:16,068
because it was the
happiest time of year.

760
00:34:16,103 --> 00:34:19,103
Finally, Winslow couldn't
hold it any longer.

761
00:34:19,137 --> 00:34:21,413
- [Winslow] Well,
what is Christmas?

762
00:34:21,448 --> 00:34:23,310
I've been told so many things.

763
00:34:24,862 --> 00:34:27,862
Roger Raccoon said
Christmas was food.

764
00:34:27,896 --> 00:34:30,724
Willard Wolf said
Christmas was for families.

765
00:34:30,758 --> 00:34:34,517
Oliver Otter said Christmas
was all sorts of things.

766
00:34:34,551 --> 00:34:38,689
Wilford, that old Wolverine,
said Christmas was a bother.

767
00:34:38,724 --> 00:34:41,758
Mother Cougar said
Christmas was singing

768
00:34:41,793 --> 00:34:44,103
and Digby said
Christmas is for kids

769
00:34:44,137 --> 00:34:47,034
and now I'm very confused.

770
00:34:47,068 --> 00:34:49,103
What is Christmas?

771
00:34:49,137 --> 00:34:50,586
- [Narrator]
Chrissy just smiled.

772
00:34:50,620 --> 00:34:53,068
Christmas is all of those
things and a lot more,

773
00:34:53,103 --> 00:34:58,034
but most important, said
Chrissy, Christmas is love.

- [Narrator] Winslow realized
that Chrissy was right,

801
00:36:54,206 --> 00:36:57,206
Christmas was everything good.

802
00:36:57,241 --> 00:36:58,793
Christmas was love

803
00:36:58,827 --> 00:37:01,206
and when you shared
that with your friends,

804
00:37:01,241 --> 00:37:04,000
it became the most
special time of year.

805
00:37:04,034 --> 00:37:06,103
- [Winslow] Christmas is love.

806
00:37:06,137 --> 00:37:07,620
- [Narrator] That's
right, said Chrissy.

807
00:37:07,655 --> 00:37:11,310
And love isn't love
until you share it

808
00:37:11,344 --> 00:37:13,793
and for the very first
time in his life,

809
00:37:13,827 --> 00:37:16,724
Winslow understood
what Christmas was.

810
00:37:16,758 --> 00:37:18,172
He was so happy.

811
00:37:18,206 --> 00:37:21,379
After all the adventures
he'd had that Christmas Eve,

812
00:37:21,413 --> 00:37:23,310
now he knew the answer.

813
00:37:23,344 --> 00:37:25,793
Christmas was love.

814
00:37:25,827 --> 00:37:27,241
Chrissy was so happy for him

815
00:37:27,275 --> 00:37:29,310
that she hugged
the silly old bear.

816
00:37:30,931 --> 00:37:33,310
It with the most special
Christmas Eve ever.

817
00:37:36,344 --> 00:37:38,620
Winslow was so happy
about what he'd learned,

818
00:37:38,655 --> 00:37:40,068
that he kissed Chrissy.

819
00:37:41,068 --> 00:37:42,413
And from that day on,

820
00:37:42,448 --> 00:37:44,620
he was known by all
his forest friends

821
00:37:44,655 --> 00:37:48,827
and by all his human friends
as Winslow that Christmas Bear.

822
00:37:49,896 --> 00:37:51,448
And now you know the story too.

823
00:37:52,896 --> 00:37:55,103
Each year, the story of
Winslow the Christmas Bear

824
00:37:55,137 --> 00:37:57,103
is told to kids just like you

825
00:37:57,137 --> 00:37:59,172
all over the world
at Christmas time.

826
00:38:03,068 --> 00:38:04,448
And who knows?

827
00:38:04,482 --> 00:38:07,448
Maybe this Christmas Eve
you'll find a magic story book

828
00:38:07,482 --> 00:38:09,379
and read about Winslow yourself.

829
00:38:19,413 --> 00:38:20,931
Because you see,

830
00:38:20,965 --> 00:38:23,482
Winslow made a promise to
himself that Christmas Eve

831
00:38:23,517 --> 00:38:28,517
to always remember and never
forget that Christmas was love.

832
00:38:32,724 --> 00:38:35,793
[subtle piano music]

833
00:38:39,724 --> 00:38:42,275
And that's exactly what he did.

834
00:38:43,344 --> 00:38:46,448
[subtle piano music]

835
00:39:00,068 --> 00:39:01,655
- [Winslow] Wait I forgot,

836
00:39:01,689 --> 00:39:04,344
there's one more
thing before we go.

837
00:39:04,379 --> 00:39:07,206
[whimsical music]

838
00:39:20,344 --> 00:39:22,172
- [Narrator] Did
you like the animals

839
00:39:22,206 --> 00:39:23,586
in Winslow the Christmas Bear?

840
00:39:23,620 --> 00:39:25,275
We all like animals, don't we?

841
00:39:25,310 --> 00:39:28,241
And these animals
are very special too.

842
00:39:28,275 --> 00:39:29,896
Did you know that
the Bear Winslow

843
00:39:29,931 --> 00:39:33,034
was raised from a baby
by this man, Troy Hyde?

844
00:39:33,068 --> 00:39:37,448
Troy is Winslow's trainer
and his very best friend.

845
00:39:37,482 --> 00:39:39,172
We all know that
animals don't do

846
00:39:39,206 --> 00:39:42,068
some of the things you
saw them do in the story.

847
00:39:42,103 --> 00:39:45,448
The animals you saw were trained
to perform certain tricks.

848
00:39:50,793 --> 00:39:54,206
Troy trains Winslow the
very best way, with love.

849
00:39:54,241 --> 00:39:56,965
It takes a great deal
of love and patience

850
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,517
to understand what
animals are really like

851
00:39:59,551 --> 00:40:02,206
and to get Winslow's
love and obedience,

852
00:40:02,241 --> 00:40:07,103
Troy always rewards his favorite
bear and Winslow loves it.

853
00:40:07,137 --> 00:40:10,689
They play together and
work together every day,

854
00:40:10,724 --> 00:40:12,068
that's very important.

855
00:40:12,103 --> 00:40:15,241
Animals need love and
attention just like people do,

856
00:40:15,275 --> 00:40:17,275
they have feelings
just like you.

857
00:40:17,310 --> 00:40:20,103
Troy Hyde has trained
all the animals you saw

858
00:40:20,137 --> 00:40:23,172
and with each of them, he
does the very same thing.

859
00:40:23,206 --> 00:40:25,551
He loves them and rewards them.

860
00:40:25,586 --> 00:40:26,827
During the filming,

861
00:40:26,862 --> 00:40:28,586
the animals would let
our cameraman and crew

862
00:40:28,620 --> 00:40:30,034
very close to them,

863
00:40:30,068 --> 00:40:32,793
but we always remembered
that these are wild animals

864
00:40:32,827 --> 00:40:34,586
and we treated
them with respect.

865
00:40:34,620 --> 00:40:36,241
That's important, isn't it?

866
00:40:36,275 --> 00:40:37,758
Do you have a pet at home?

867
00:40:37,793 --> 00:40:40,275
Do you know of different kinds
of animals where you live?

868
00:40:40,310 --> 00:40:41,241
You know what?

869
00:40:41,275 --> 00:40:43,241
They need love and affection too

870
00:40:43,275 --> 00:40:46,034
and you can reward your
pet to show that love.

871
00:40:47,517 --> 00:40:50,448
It seemed like Winslow could
talk in this story, didn't it?

872
00:40:50,482 --> 00:40:53,448
But we really know that
animals can't talk,

873
00:40:53,482 --> 00:40:55,206
but they can
communicate with you.

874
00:40:55,241 --> 00:40:58,551
Animals don't talk, they feel.

875
00:40:58,586 --> 00:41:00,551
That's right, just like us

876
00:41:00,586 --> 00:41:03,068
they can feel all the
things that we feel

877
00:41:03,103 --> 00:41:06,517
and that's how they
tell us what they need.

878
00:41:06,551 --> 00:41:11,275
Remember, animals are very
special, just like you are

879
00:41:11,310 --> 00:41:14,310
and we must always treat
them like our good friends,

880
00:41:14,344 --> 00:41:17,551
because that's
exactly what they are.
