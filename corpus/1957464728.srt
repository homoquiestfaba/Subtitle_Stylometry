1
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:21,182
Rowena.

2
00:02:21,266 --> 00:02:24,185
Uh. Are you still up?
Everyone's coming early tomorrow.

3
00:02:24,269 --> 00:02:28,106
Relax, Mom. Getting up early
on Christmas is what I do best.

4
00:02:28,189 --> 00:02:31,651
Ayayay. What a mess. I thought we agreed
you'd clean up, Rowena.

5
00:02:31,735 --> 00:02:34,946
I wanted to,
but I was so excited for Christmas.

6
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:36,239
Uh-huh.

7
00:02:36,322 --> 00:02:39,659
I didn't know you still had this.

8
00:02:39,743 --> 00:02:40,744
I love that thing.

9
00:02:40,827 --> 00:02:44,164
It reminds me of the Christmas
when we all went to go see The Nutcracker.

10
00:02:44,247 --> 00:02:46,833
Surprised you still remember it.
You were so young.

11
00:02:46,916 --> 00:02:50,587
Well, I slept through half of it,
but the other half really landed.

12
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:52,589
It almost made my list. Look.

13
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:55,842
Okay.
"Rowena's top five Christmas memories."

14
00:02:55,925 --> 00:02:59,304
"Number five: The Christmas
Around the World exhibit at the museum."

15
00:02:59,387 --> 00:03:02,766
That's where we took that picture
of you and Gabriella under the big tree.

16
00:03:02,849 --> 00:03:04,392
- "Number four: The pier."
- Remember?

17
00:03:04,476 --> 00:03:06,644
We got to see all the holiday performers.

18
00:03:06,728 --> 00:03:10,357
And I got to ride the Ferris wheel.
That was a classic.

19
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:13,109
"Number three:
The Santa versus Elves hockey match."

20
00:03:13,193 --> 00:03:15,820
Which Dad and I
will definitely want to watch tomorrow.

21
00:03:16,488 --> 00:03:18,656
"Number two: That big platform thingy."

22
00:03:19,657 --> 00:03:21,659
The giant platform thingy that opens out

23
00:03:21,743 --> 00:03:24,037
so you feel like you're flying
over the city.

24
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:26,373
Right. At the top of the Hancock building.

25
00:03:26,456 --> 00:03:28,583
But you were too scared
to even step on it.

26
00:03:28,667 --> 00:03:31,586
Okay, yeah, but I watched Gabby do it
from only a few feet away.

27
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:33,755
The look on her face was priceless.

28
00:03:36,549 --> 00:03:39,302
And my number one favorite
Christmas memory: The Winterfest.

29
00:03:39,386 --> 00:03:40,387
- Obvi.
- Obvi.

30
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:42,889
Can we please go back to the Winterfest
tomorrow, Mom?

31
00:03:42,972 --> 00:03:46,434
Well, honey, we might have to
switch things up a little bit this year.

32
00:03:46,518 --> 00:03:48,895
It's our first Christmas
with some new faces.

33
00:03:48,978 --> 00:03:51,189
You mean Diane and Louie?

34
00:03:51,272 --> 00:03:54,609
Honey, I know that these memories
mean a lot to you,

35
00:03:54,693 --> 00:03:56,611
but, hey, we can make new memories.

36
00:03:56,695 --> 00:03:58,780
Christmas isn't only about tradition.

37
00:03:58,863 --> 00:04:02,242
It's about us being all together
despite the changes.

38
00:04:02,325 --> 00:04:04,202
But don't want anything to change.

39
00:04:04,285 --> 00:04:07,122
I know you don't, honey,
but sometimes change is for the best.

40
00:04:07,205 --> 00:04:10,291
And you'd know that if you cleaned
your room every once in a while.

41
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:14,254
Okay, lights out, you, or someone's
not getting a visit from Santa.

42
00:04:17,048 --> 00:04:18,883
Buenas noches, mi niñita.

43
00:04:18,967 --> 00:04:20,677
Buenas noches, Mama.

44
00:04:35,025 --> 00:04:37,652
Good morning, Chicago!

45
00:04:37,736 --> 00:04:39,863
It's that day you've all been waiting for.

46
00:04:39,946 --> 00:04:42,782
- That's right. It is Christma...
- Christma...

47
00:04:51,916 --> 00:04:52,916
Boo!

48
00:04:59,674 --> 00:05:02,010
Louie! Oh, you're gonna get it!

49
00:05:08,099 --> 00:05:10,769
Got you, you little devil.
What are you doing? Having fun upstairs?

50
00:05:10,852 --> 00:05:12,896
Yeah, I was having lots of fun with Ro.

51
00:05:12,979 --> 00:05:14,606
Hey, sprout. Merry Christmas.

52
00:05:14,689 --> 00:05:15,732
Merry Christmas, Dad.

53
00:05:16,858 --> 00:05:19,527
Uh, why didn't you come wake me
like you always do?

54
00:05:19,611 --> 00:05:21,696
Well, I wanted to,
but Louie asked to do the honors.

55
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:23,198
Looks like he got the job done.

56
00:05:23,281 --> 00:05:24,616
She's totally up.

57
00:05:24,699 --> 00:05:25,700
Yeah, she is.

58
00:05:26,868 --> 00:05:28,745
Come on, Ro. Come say hi to Diane.

59
00:05:30,538 --> 00:05:31,539
Up, over.

60
00:05:31,623 --> 00:05:33,041
Yes, just like that!

61
00:05:33,792 --> 00:05:35,210
Guess who decided to join us.

62
00:05:35,293 --> 00:05:37,003
Morning, sleepyhead.

63
00:05:37,087 --> 00:05:38,838
Rowena, Merry Christmas.

64
00:05:38,922 --> 00:05:41,841
Your dad told me
that you made the softball team.

65
00:05:41,925 --> 00:05:43,176
What position do you play?

66
00:05:43,259 --> 00:05:44,469
- Goalie.
- Ro.

67
00:05:44,552 --> 00:05:46,054
Okay. Shortstop.

68
00:05:46,137 --> 00:05:49,641
Dad, I made a list of my favorite
Christmas memories for us to do again.

69
00:05:49,724 --> 00:05:51,476
Which do want to do first?

70
00:05:52,143 --> 00:05:54,646
Gee, I don't know, sprout.

71
00:05:54,729 --> 00:05:56,815
I think your mom's planning
a nice day for everyone.

72
00:05:56,898 --> 00:05:58,441
We might have to play this by ear.

73
00:05:58,525 --> 00:06:01,736
Uh, but we can at least watch
the Santas versus Elves match, can't we?

74
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:03,947
This has got to be the Santas' year.

75
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:06,157
Oh, I hope so,
after the last couple beatdowns.

76
00:06:06,241 --> 00:06:08,552
Although I'm hearing that
the Santas' center is out with spasms.

77
00:06:08,576 --> 00:06:11,079
Again? That guy should really stretch.

78
00:06:11,162 --> 00:06:12,789
- Uh, do you think...
- What's a center?

79
00:06:13,373 --> 00:06:17,043
Uh, a position in hockey. Usually
the middle player on the forward line.

80
00:06:17,544 --> 00:06:19,230
- Do you think we could...
- What are spasms?

81
00:06:19,254 --> 00:06:22,757
Something you won't have to worry about
for a long time.

82
00:06:22,841 --> 00:06:24,926
I'm sorry, sweetheart.
What were you asking me?

83
00:06:25,427 --> 00:06:27,804
- Do you think the Santas could still...
- Shoelaces.

84
00:06:36,229 --> 00:06:37,939
Who took the last chocolate?

85
00:06:43,028 --> 00:06:44,571
- Stop it!
- It wasn't me.

86
00:06:46,031 --> 00:06:48,908
Uh, maybe Santa was hungry last night.

87
00:06:48,992 --> 00:06:51,327
Don't give me that, Dad.
I'm not a little baby like Louie.

88
00:06:51,411 --> 00:06:53,329
- Watch it, Ro.
- But, Mom,

89
00:06:53,413 --> 00:06:56,124
we trade off every year
who gets the last chocolate.

90
00:06:56,207 --> 00:06:58,043
This was supposed to be my year.

91
00:06:58,543 --> 00:07:02,797
It was me. I'm sorry, Rowena.
I-I didn't know about your tradition.

92
00:07:03,923 --> 00:07:05,091
Look what I can do.

93
00:07:06,134 --> 00:07:09,054
Oh, Louie, that's wonderful.

94
00:07:09,137 --> 00:07:10,930
- He's only had one class.
- Oh.

95
00:07:13,183 --> 00:07:14,768
Hope you asked Santa for a blankie.

96
00:07:16,519 --> 00:07:21,024
'Cause it's gonna be cold
out of that spotlight.

97
00:07:24,152 --> 00:07:28,239
Ay, Gabriella.

98
00:07:29,407 --> 00:07:32,410
You two are looking lively indeed.
How was midnight mass?

99
00:07:32,494 --> 00:07:33,870
- Ooh.
- Absolutely transporting.

100
00:07:33,953 --> 00:07:34,954
Good.

101
00:07:35,038 --> 00:07:37,624
Oh, Diane, it's so good to see you.

102
00:07:37,707 --> 00:07:40,585
It's good to see you, Sofia.
And you too, Hector.

103
00:07:40,669 --> 00:07:44,381
Diana, por favor. I already told you
all my friends call me Doc.

104
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:47,300
- Well, Merry Christmas, Doc.
- Merry Christmas.

105
00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:53,056
- Oh.
- Oh, my little Rowena.

106
00:07:55,141 --> 00:07:58,061
Did you like the sweater?
I made it myself.

107
00:07:58,144 --> 00:08:00,063
We haven't opened presents yet, Ma.

108
00:08:00,146 --> 00:08:02,857
- Oh.
- But thanks for the spoiler.

109
00:08:02,941 --> 00:08:03,942
Aw.

110
00:08:04,025 --> 00:08:06,319
All right. All right.

111
00:08:06,403 --> 00:08:08,238
You'll smother the poor girl.

112
00:08:08,321 --> 00:08:11,074
Ro, are we having a nice Christmas?

113
00:08:11,157 --> 00:08:12,992
- Oh.
- Oh.

114
00:08:13,076 --> 00:08:16,788
Mmm.

115
00:08:16,871 --> 00:08:19,541
It's my fault.
I should never have dragged you

116
00:08:19,624 --> 00:08:21,126
to that greasy spoon diner.

117
00:08:21,793 --> 00:08:23,378
Ro.

118
00:08:23,461 --> 00:08:25,714
Oh, no.

119
00:08:25,797 --> 00:08:27,173
Ew!

120
00:08:27,257 --> 00:08:28,758
Sausage and eggs.

121
00:08:31,136 --> 00:08:32,345
Uncle Gerry. Uncle Bruce.

122
00:08:32,429 --> 00:08:34,222
Merry Christmas!

123
00:08:35,849 --> 00:08:36,975
You got a dog?

124
00:08:37,058 --> 00:08:39,144
Perfect. She's awake again.

125
00:08:39,227 --> 00:08:41,730
We adopted Olive from the shelter.
She kept us up all night.

126
00:08:41,813 --> 00:08:43,606
- Okay. Come in.
- Hey, you wanna hold her?

127
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:46,818
- Yes. Oh, my God. Isn't she cute?
- Here she is.

128
00:08:46,901 --> 00:08:51,031
Who do we have here?
Who is it? Oh, it's a baby.

129
00:08:51,114 --> 00:08:53,867
Oh. Oh.

130
00:08:55,702 --> 00:09:00,707
It's a good thing you're not a cat
'cause cats make me so sneezy.

131
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:04,127
Oh, hey, I know a little boy
who'd love to meet you.

132
00:09:07,255 --> 00:09:08,923
Uncle Gerry?

133
00:09:09,007 --> 00:09:10,258
It's not mine. Hers.

134
00:09:10,342 --> 00:09:12,344
Well, then you give her the socks.

135
00:09:12,427 --> 00:09:15,180
I love my new Mariachi CD.

136
00:09:17,432 --> 00:09:19,642
It's a scrapbook and paper.

137
00:09:19,726 --> 00:09:22,187
But, Mom, you always get me clothes.

138
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:24,064
Which you never like. You always complain.

139
00:09:24,147 --> 00:09:26,399
Yeah, at first.
But then you make me try them on

140
00:09:26,483 --> 00:09:27,609
and I low-key love them.

141
00:09:27,692 --> 00:09:30,987
That's like our thing, Mom.
Why are you messing with the program?

142
00:09:31,071 --> 00:09:32,364
I will still buy you clothes.

143
00:09:32,447 --> 00:09:34,616
I just thought
you might like something new.

144
00:09:34,699 --> 00:09:37,118
This is definitely new, all right.

145
00:09:37,869 --> 00:09:39,329
I made cookies.

146
00:09:39,412 --> 00:09:40,413
Yum-yum.

147
00:09:40,497 --> 00:09:42,417
- Oh, is there dairy in them?
- Oh, no. No dairy.

148
00:09:42,499 --> 00:09:44,419
I love dessert for breakfast.
Especially cookies.

149
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:47,587
Is there kale in this?

150
00:09:47,671 --> 00:09:50,340
There is indeed. You've got a great nose.

151
00:09:50,423 --> 00:09:51,716
They're my best sellers.

152
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:53,551
- Oh, I need to try one.
- I guess.

153
00:09:55,011 --> 00:09:58,682
Honey, pick up after yourself.
Someone is going to break their neck.

154
00:09:58,765 --> 00:10:00,266
This is what we do every year, Mom.

155
00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:02,977
Gabby and I make a mess
so that you can get mad and clean it up.

156
00:10:03,061 --> 00:10:05,313
That is not funny.
And if you're trying to make me mad,

157
00:10:05,397 --> 00:10:06,398
it's working.

158
00:10:08,775 --> 00:10:09,859
Yes, open this one.

159
00:10:11,861 --> 00:10:12,862
Oh!

160
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:16,074
It's a stage makeup kit.

161
00:10:16,157 --> 00:10:18,201
Your dad said
that you were in the school play.

162
00:10:19,369 --> 00:10:20,995
In third grade.

163
00:10:21,079 --> 00:10:23,748
My favorite part
was definitely the makeup.

164
00:10:24,666 --> 00:10:26,751
No way!

165
00:10:26,835 --> 00:10:29,504
- Aw.
- How cool. A bow and arr...

166
00:10:29,587 --> 00:10:30,964
Oh.

167
00:10:31,047 --> 00:10:33,675
Honey, come on. You are killing me.

168
00:10:36,219 --> 00:10:37,637
This one's from your uncles.

169
00:10:37,721 --> 00:10:38,930
I hope you like it.

170
00:10:40,181 --> 00:10:42,434
- This, Ro, is what we call a judogi.
- Oh, wow.

171
00:10:42,517 --> 00:10:44,686
It's what all true judokas wear.

172
00:10:44,769 --> 00:10:46,062
- Wow.
- I got one too!

173
00:10:46,146 --> 00:10:47,814
Twinsies. Hiyah!

174
00:10:47,897 --> 00:10:49,774
Oh, look at him.
I told you he'd look cute.

175
00:10:51,401 --> 00:10:53,278
- Oh, okay, that is really cute.
- Oh.

176
00:10:53,361 --> 00:10:56,031
All right, sprout.
You're gonna like this one.

177
00:10:56,114 --> 00:10:58,616
I noticed yours was getting old
so we got you...

178
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:00,201
A tablet!

179
00:11:01,661 --> 00:11:02,912
With knobs?

180
00:11:02,996 --> 00:11:04,539
That's a classic.

181
00:11:04,622 --> 00:11:07,917
Mira, you turn the knob's to draw,
then shake it up and…whew.

182
00:11:09,794 --> 00:11:11,254
Like it never happened.

183
00:11:11,338 --> 00:11:12,773
- I think there's been a mix-up.
- Yeah.

184
00:11:12,797 --> 00:11:14,132
Awesome!

185
00:11:14,215 --> 00:11:16,426
Okay, buddy, that was supposed to be for...

186
00:11:16,509 --> 00:11:18,011
I love it so much!

187
00:11:18,094 --> 00:11:21,639
- Can we play catch now? Can we?
- I'm sorry, sprout. We'll figure it out.

188
00:11:21,723 --> 00:11:24,100
Why don't you grab your glove
and meet us outside?

189
00:11:24,184 --> 00:11:25,769
That was my glove.

190
00:11:27,354 --> 00:11:29,022
- Carolina.
- Sí?

191
00:11:29,105 --> 00:11:32,484
Your father and I want to give you
something very special.

192
00:11:32,567 --> 00:11:34,277
- Oh, okay.
- Mmm.

193
00:11:36,488 --> 00:11:38,698
This was given to us.

194
00:11:39,616 --> 00:11:41,951
It's been in our family for generations.

195
00:11:42,035 --> 00:11:44,579
Passed down to me
from my bisabuela, Lucia,

196
00:11:44,662 --> 00:11:48,833
from Puerto Rico, who had it passed
from her tatarabuela, Maribelle.

197
00:11:49,501 --> 00:11:55,507
Ay. I still remember her
serving arroz con gandules in this.

198
00:11:55,590 --> 00:11:57,175
Gracias, Mama. Thank you.

199
00:11:57,258 --> 00:11:58,760
I love it. I love it.

200
00:12:01,054 --> 00:12:03,139
- Where's my phone?
- I love it.

201
00:12:04,683 --> 00:12:06,142
Ew! Dog slobber.

202
00:12:06,226 --> 00:12:09,270
- ¡Ay!
- No!

203
00:12:11,690 --> 00:12:18,530
And to think all those kids
used to call me butterfingers.

204
00:12:18,613 --> 00:12:19,613
Oh!

205
00:12:24,035 --> 00:12:25,036
Oh!

206
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:26,538
I'm okay.

207
00:12:26,621 --> 00:12:27,997
Okay, well...

208
00:12:28,081 --> 00:12:29,374
Well, that just happened.

209
00:12:30,291 --> 00:12:32,877
I guess I'm just gonna go look
for my glove.

210
00:12:32,961 --> 00:12:33,962
Yeah.

211
00:12:35,463 --> 00:12:36,703
- Bruce.
- The bowl! Oh, my God!

212
00:12:42,637 --> 00:12:44,639
Well, at least you didn't pee on it.

213
00:12:46,349 --> 00:12:48,059
And you just peed on it.

214
00:12:48,768 --> 00:12:49,769
Cool.

215
00:12:53,481 --> 00:12:54,899
Ew.

216
00:12:58,028 --> 00:12:59,029
Ready? Here we go.

217
00:13:00,238 --> 00:13:01,781
Nice. You got it.

218
00:13:03,408 --> 00:13:04,409
Throw it back.

219
00:13:17,964 --> 00:13:19,507
- Perfecto.
- Oh, man, I'm starving.

220
00:13:19,591 --> 00:13:21,593
- It's good? Not too salty?
- Try abuela's tamales.

221
00:13:21,676 --> 00:13:25,096
- Uh-uh.
- Ah, you t... You took the last tamale.

222
00:13:26,097 --> 00:13:28,725
I'm done eating. Can Dad and I go watch
the rest of the match?

223
00:13:28,808 --> 00:13:31,436
Uh, sprout, I just sat down.

224
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:33,938
- And last I checked, it pains me to say…
- Mm-hmm.

225
00:13:34,022 --> 00:13:36,483
- …the Elves are crushing my Santas.
- What?

226
00:13:36,566 --> 00:13:38,735
- I'm gonna get that five dollars.
- I know. I know.

227
00:13:38,818 --> 00:13:41,321
You can go after everyone's finished
with dinner and dessert.

228
00:13:41,404 --> 00:13:42,572
I made gingerbread cake.

229
00:13:42,655 --> 00:13:45,325
Oh, did somebody say gingerbread?

230
00:13:45,408 --> 00:13:46,868
Okay, now…

231
00:13:46,951 --> 00:13:49,287
Because last year
you didn't save any for the kids,

232
00:13:49,371 --> 00:13:52,165
so I'm instituting
a one-slice rule para ti.

233
00:13:52,248 --> 00:13:54,626
Th-That is a baseless accusation.

234
00:13:54,709 --> 00:13:58,463
I could sue you for defamation,
or you could cough up the gingerbread.

235
00:13:58,546 --> 00:14:00,173
Oh, I know.

236
00:14:00,256 --> 00:14:01,966
We should make him perform for his cake.

237
00:14:02,050 --> 00:14:03,843
Gerry's been taking a stand-up class.

238
00:14:03,927 --> 00:14:05,647
- Bruce, you said you wouldn't tell.
- What?

239
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:07,555
He only gets cake
if he tells a joke.

240
00:14:07,639 --> 00:14:09,724
Mom, the match is almost over.

241
00:14:09,808 --> 00:14:14,062
Fine. You can go watch,
but first finish your dinner.

242
00:14:17,941 --> 00:14:19,901
Stand-up comedy. Gerry, that's awesome.

243
00:14:20,694 --> 00:14:22,404
And he's still a tad shy.

244
00:14:22,487 --> 00:14:25,532
Hey, why don't you show them
that bit that you've been working on?

245
00:14:25,615 --> 00:14:27,701
- Bruce, I'm still working on it.
- Yeah, yeah.

246
00:14:27,784 --> 00:14:29,828
- Come on, Gerry. Do it.
- You gotta do it.

247
00:14:29,911 --> 00:14:32,497
- Do it, Gerry.
- Do it! Do it! Do it!

248
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:34,708
Okay. Okay.

249
00:14:34,791 --> 00:14:38,503
Just be kind
'cause it's still a work in progress.

250
00:14:40,463 --> 00:14:42,382
Well… …here goes nothing.

251
00:14:42,465 --> 00:14:44,426
All done. Come on, Dad. Let's go.

252
00:14:44,509 --> 00:14:46,136
Rowena. Sit.

253
00:14:47,512 --> 00:14:48,513
Thank you.

254
00:14:50,223 --> 00:14:51,391
Okay.

255
00:14:54,394 --> 00:14:58,732
So I'm a lawyer, right?
As you already know.

256
00:14:58,815 --> 00:15:01,067
And the hardest part of being a lawyer…

257
00:15:01,151 --> 00:15:03,445
…is turning off work mode
when you get home.

258
00:15:06,406 --> 00:15:09,534
Hilarious, Uncle Gerry. Wonderful show.

259
00:15:09,617 --> 00:15:11,911
You know,
we're off to go watch some hockey.

260
00:15:11,995 --> 00:15:13,955
Ro, he hasn't gotten to the punch line.

261
00:15:14,039 --> 00:15:15,665
Sit down.

262
00:15:18,293 --> 00:15:20,003
You're doing great, Ger. "Work mode…"

263
00:15:20,754 --> 00:15:21,755
Right.

264
00:15:23,173 --> 00:15:27,302
So, the hardest part of being lawyer
is turning off work mode

265
00:15:27,385 --> 00:15:28,803
when you get home.

266
00:15:28,887 --> 00:15:30,680
You already said that.

267
00:15:30,764 --> 00:15:33,183
Ro, will you let your uncle
finish telling his joke?

268
00:15:33,266 --> 00:15:34,642
I'm just trying to help.

269
00:15:34,726 --> 00:15:37,520
You know what I just realized?
I don't even like gingerbread.

270
00:15:38,146 --> 00:15:40,106
I move we strike the discussion.

271
00:15:40,190 --> 00:15:42,275
- Come on, Ger. Continue.
- Gerry, Gerry!

272
00:15:42,359 --> 00:15:44,069
- Come on, guys. No.
- Gerry! Gerry!

273
00:15:44,152 --> 00:15:45,195
I said no!

274
00:15:45,987 --> 00:15:47,489
I don't even want any cake.

275
00:15:47,572 --> 00:15:49,199
Just leave me alone. Okay?

276
00:15:49,282 --> 00:15:50,909
- Gerry!
- Come on, Uncle Gerry.

277
00:15:52,035 --> 00:15:55,121
- Come back!
- There goes Bruce. Great.

278
00:15:56,498 --> 00:15:57,499
And now the dog.

279
00:16:04,714 --> 00:16:06,549
I just have to have
some more of this bread.

280
00:16:06,633 --> 00:16:08,551
- It was so good.
- It was fantastic.

281
00:16:23,066 --> 00:16:24,109
Oh!

282
00:16:24,192 --> 00:16:25,610
- Oh!
- What?

283
00:16:25,694 --> 00:16:27,112
My dinner.

284
00:16:28,029 --> 00:16:30,615
Well, clearly dinner's officially over.

285
00:16:30,699 --> 00:16:32,450
Does anybody wanna watch the match?

286
00:16:33,201 --> 00:16:34,828
Anybody?

287
00:16:35,787 --> 00:16:37,414
- Anybody?
- I will.

288
00:16:38,832 --> 00:16:39,916
Anybody else?

289
00:16:40,542 --> 00:16:44,629
- Five minutes left in this match.
- Santas are nearly out of time.

290
00:16:44,713 --> 00:16:47,966
- Where is Rudolph when you need him?
- Come on, Santas. D up!

291
00:16:48,049 --> 00:16:50,093
Woo! Let's go!

292
00:16:52,595 --> 00:16:55,432
What? Come on! Where is the remote?

293
00:16:55,515 --> 00:16:56,795
Can you believe what's happening

294
00:16:56,850 --> 00:16:57,684
- on this ice?
- Okay.

295
00:16:57,767 --> 00:16:59,769
- Let's go!
- The Elves are running away with this.

296
00:16:59,853 --> 00:17:00,937
More like skating away.

297
00:17:01,021 --> 00:17:03,648
It's gonna be awkward
in Santa's village tonight.

298
00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:05,734
What is going on?

299
00:17:09,237 --> 00:17:10,530
Okay. Okay.

300
00:17:14,784 --> 00:17:17,704
Give me the remote, Louie.

301
00:17:17,787 --> 00:17:20,331
- Why?
- So I can beat you with it.

302
00:17:20,415 --> 00:17:22,959
- Then no.
- I'm gonna count to three.

303
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:24,919
- One.
- Catch.

304
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:27,339
Ow!

305
00:17:29,007 --> 00:17:30,133
Whoa!

306
00:17:38,308 --> 00:17:41,019
Ro, what is going on?

307
00:17:41,102 --> 00:17:43,938
He started it.
He wouldn't let me watch the match.

308
00:17:44,022 --> 00:17:46,066
- I hate him!
- That's enough, Rowena.

309
00:17:46,149 --> 00:17:48,068
Yeah, that's enough, Ro-wiener.

310
00:17:49,027 --> 00:17:50,904
Why do you always take his side?

311
00:17:50,987 --> 00:17:53,907
Rowena! What did you do to my laptop?

312
00:17:54,532 --> 00:17:56,201
I'm going to kill you!

313
00:17:56,284 --> 00:17:57,369
Get in line.

314
00:17:57,452 --> 00:17:59,704
- You ruined Christmas!
- I ruined Christmas?

315
00:17:59,788 --> 00:18:02,540
You ruined Christmas.
All of you ruined Christmas.

316
00:18:02,624 --> 00:18:05,669
I'm sure you don't mean that.
So, let's just all take a deep...

317
00:18:05,752 --> 00:18:07,837
You're not even in this family, Diane.

318
00:18:07,921 --> 00:18:09,881
Why are you even here?

319
00:18:09,964 --> 00:18:12,050
Do you wanna get grounded
on Christmas Day?

320
00:18:12,133 --> 00:18:13,635
This is the worst Christmas ever.

321
00:18:15,136 --> 00:18:18,336
- Ro, you have to clean this mess up.
- Ro, you better get back here, young lady.

322
00:18:18,390 --> 00:18:19,391
I'm so sorry.

323
00:18:34,531 --> 00:18:37,450
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hey, hey, hey, now.

324
00:18:37,534 --> 00:18:39,828
- What gives?
- Sorry, sorry, sorry!

325
00:18:39,911 --> 00:18:42,747
I didn't see you there.
It's been a long day.

326
00:18:42,831 --> 00:18:46,584
Tell me about it. I got stuck in a chimney
face down in Sweden,

327
00:18:46,668 --> 00:18:48,128
and then Rudolph... You know Rudolph?

328
00:18:48,211 --> 00:18:51,589
He's the one with the...
Well, his nose went out over Toronto.

329
00:18:51,673 --> 00:18:54,300
Had us flying blind for a stretch.

330
00:18:54,384 --> 00:18:57,178
Look, I know you're not really Santa.

331
00:18:57,262 --> 00:18:59,305
I mean, your beard is clearly fake.

332
00:18:59,389 --> 00:19:00,390
My bea...

333
00:19:00,473 --> 00:19:05,186
This? Yes, yes. This is clearly fake.
You got me on that one. It's...

334
00:19:05,270 --> 00:19:07,355
I just wear this for the windburn
on the sled.

335
00:19:07,439 --> 00:19:10,108
Let me ask you something.
And this is between me and you.

336
00:19:10,191 --> 00:19:13,403
Do you know anybody
who's ever actually seen Santa?

337
00:19:14,904 --> 00:19:16,781
Then how do you know what he looks like?

338
00:19:16,865 --> 00:19:21,578
I mean, maybe Santa is tall
and terrified of ceiling fans.

339
00:19:21,661 --> 00:19:23,955
Look, I'm 12, okay?

340
00:19:24,039 --> 00:19:26,958
How can one guy make it across
the whole world in one night?

341
00:19:27,042 --> 00:19:31,004
Oh, okay. Well, time is a tricky thing.

342
00:19:31,504 --> 00:19:33,173
A lot can happen in a day.

343
00:19:33,256 --> 00:19:35,008
Say that again.

344
00:19:35,091 --> 00:19:37,969
Time is a tricky thing.
A lot can happen in a day.

345
00:19:38,053 --> 00:19:39,971
I can't wait for this day to be over.

346
00:19:40,055 --> 00:19:41,348
Oh.

347
00:19:41,431 --> 00:19:43,391
Uh-oh. You hear that sound?

348
00:19:43,475 --> 00:19:46,770
That's the sound of somebody
not having a very fun Christmas, huh?

349
00:19:46,853 --> 00:19:47,979
Well, I tell you what.

350
00:19:48,063 --> 00:19:51,566
Lucky for you, Santa is here.

351
00:19:51,649 --> 00:19:53,943
Ho, ho, ho!

352
00:19:54,027 --> 00:19:55,445
Ho...

353
00:19:55,945 --> 00:19:58,448
I seriously think
I pulled something on that one.

354
00:19:58,531 --> 00:20:01,534
But go ahead. Come on. Give it to me.
Tell me what you want.

355
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:06,122
The only thing I want is for things
to go back to how they used to be.

356
00:20:06,206 --> 00:20:08,208
You mean, like a do-over?

357
00:20:13,505 --> 00:20:14,547
Yeah.

358
00:20:14,631 --> 00:20:17,092
So that this awful day
could have never happened.

359
00:20:17,175 --> 00:20:20,387
So that I can have
a normal Christmas again.

360
00:20:23,348 --> 00:20:25,100
Could you say that again?

361
00:20:25,183 --> 00:20:27,560
Louder. I didn't hear you.

362
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:34,776
I wish I can have my Christmas again!

363
00:20:36,152 --> 00:20:37,987
That's what I thought you said.

364
00:20:39,781 --> 00:20:40,865
Ro?

365
00:20:42,158 --> 00:20:45,412
- What are you doing out here?
- I was talking to tall Santa.

366
00:20:49,499 --> 00:20:52,544
Honey, what is going on with you?

367
00:20:53,795 --> 00:20:55,922
I understand
that you're having a hard time

368
00:20:56,006 --> 00:20:58,258
but your behavior
is completely inappropriate.

369
00:20:58,341 --> 00:21:01,469
But he really was here.
You've got to believe me.

370
00:21:02,053 --> 00:21:05,765
Okay, let's go inside.
I want you to apologize to everyone.

371
00:21:06,266 --> 00:21:07,267
Now.

372
00:21:33,626 --> 00:21:36,212
Good morning, Chicago!

373
00:21:36,296 --> 00:21:37,922
It's that day you've all been...

374
00:21:40,050 --> 00:21:42,052
I must've hit record or something.

375
00:21:50,685 --> 00:21:51,811
Boo!

376
00:21:56,566 --> 00:21:59,736
Why are you still here?

377
00:21:59,819 --> 00:22:02,947
Got you, you little devil.
What are you doing? Having fun upstairs?

378
00:22:03,031 --> 00:22:04,949
- Yeah, I was having lots of fun.
- Dad?

379
00:22:05,033 --> 00:22:06,076
- With who?
- With Ro.

380
00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:07,202
What were you doing?

381
00:22:07,285 --> 00:22:08,745
What is happening?

382
00:22:08,828 --> 00:22:10,264
- Just like that.
- Are you doing it?

383
00:22:10,288 --> 00:22:11,206
- The head bob?
- No.

384
00:22:11,289 --> 00:22:13,416
- Over, up.
- Just like that. Yes.

385
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:15,168
Guess who decided to join us.

386
00:22:15,251 --> 00:22:17,087
Morning, sleepyhead.

387
00:22:17,170 --> 00:22:18,838
Rowena, Merry Christmas.

388
00:22:18,922 --> 00:22:20,924
Your dad told me
that you made the softball team.

389
00:22:21,007 --> 00:22:22,258
So what position do you play?

390
00:22:22,342 --> 00:22:26,054
Is this a joke? We already did Christmas.

391
00:22:26,137 --> 00:22:27,597
Shoelaces.

392
00:22:27,681 --> 00:22:30,016
Hey, sweetie,
I know it was kind of a shock

393
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:32,394
having me and Louie here for Thanksgiving,

394
00:22:32,477 --> 00:22:35,188
but we all thought
things would be easier by Christmas.

395
00:22:45,615 --> 00:22:47,117
Look what I can do.

396
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:48,910
I'm still dreaming. That's it.

397
00:22:49,703 --> 00:22:53,164
- Ow!
- Nope. Definitely awake.

398
00:22:54,457 --> 00:22:58,920
Ay, my little Rowena.

399
00:23:02,757 --> 00:23:05,552
Did you like the sweater?
I made it myself.

400
00:23:05,635 --> 00:23:07,804
Haven't opened presents yet, Mama.

401
00:23:07,887 --> 00:23:09,222
Ay.

402
00:23:09,305 --> 00:23:11,099
All right. All right.

403
00:23:11,182 --> 00:23:13,435
You'll smother the poor girl.

404
00:23:13,518 --> 00:23:16,479
Ro, are we having a nice Christmas?

405
00:23:17,355 --> 00:23:19,232
- Oh.
- Oh.

406
00:23:19,315 --> 00:23:20,942
Mmm.

407
00:23:21,026 --> 00:23:23,611
Abuela,
you went to the greasy spoon diner again?

408
00:23:23,695 --> 00:23:26,948
Oh, it's my fault.
I should never have dragged you there.

409
00:23:27,782 --> 00:23:28,783
Ro.

410
00:23:31,411 --> 00:23:32,537
Not again.

411
00:23:34,873 --> 00:23:37,250
That does it. This isn't funny.

412
00:23:46,676 --> 00:23:48,928
Hey, Mommy, did you make the, um…

413
00:23:50,305 --> 00:23:52,015
- Si.
- Yes.

414
00:23:55,060 --> 00:23:56,061
This is good.

415
00:23:59,689 --> 00:24:01,358
You're all mad at me for yesterday.

416
00:24:02,108 --> 00:24:04,069
You're trying to teach me a lesson.

417
00:24:04,652 --> 00:24:08,031
Aw, thanks, you guys.
I totally get it now.

418
00:24:08,114 --> 00:24:11,368
I'll be so much better. I promise.

419
00:24:11,451 --> 00:24:15,205
Honey, what are you talking about?
Nobody is mad at you.

420
00:24:15,288 --> 00:24:16,706
Okay, here. Open my present.

421
00:24:18,875 --> 00:24:20,085
I hope you like it.

422
00:24:22,337 --> 00:24:25,840
A scrapbook!

423
00:24:26,383 --> 00:24:28,134
And paper?

424
00:24:29,094 --> 00:24:31,096
Wrapped in more paper?

425
00:24:31,179 --> 00:24:33,098
Ro, you don't have to be sarcastic.

426
00:24:33,181 --> 00:24:35,183
I made cookies!

427
00:24:35,266 --> 00:24:37,352
Diane, can I open your present?

428
00:24:37,435 --> 00:24:40,480
I've always wanted a stage makeup kit.

429
00:24:41,272 --> 00:24:43,066
Ro, have you been peeking at your gifts?

430
00:24:43,149 --> 00:24:45,735
No, Mom, I swear. I can be good.

431
00:24:45,819 --> 00:24:48,363
I'll even like the tablet with knobs,

432
00:24:48,446 --> 00:24:51,491
which was probably meant for Louie,
but I don't care anymore, see?

433
00:24:51,574 --> 00:24:53,076
I've learned my lesson.

434
00:24:53,159 --> 00:24:55,286
So can we all just stop with the joke now?

435
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,001
Please.

436
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:21,730
This is not good.

437
00:25:24,649 --> 00:25:26,026
- Yes!
- Yes.

438
00:25:26,109 --> 00:25:27,777
Guess who decided to join us.

439
00:25:27,861 --> 00:25:29,446
Morning, sleepyhead.

440
00:25:29,529 --> 00:25:32,115
Rowena, Merry Christmas.

441
00:25:37,787 --> 00:25:39,122
I think I messed up.

442
00:25:39,205 --> 00:25:42,000
I wished for Christmas again,
and now I'm stuck in the same day.

443
00:25:42,792 --> 00:25:47,172
Crazy.

444
00:25:49,424 --> 00:25:50,759
You guys don't believe me.

445
00:25:52,052 --> 00:25:53,053
Fine.

446
00:25:56,181 --> 00:25:58,183
- Hey.
- Let me guess.

447
00:25:58,266 --> 00:26:00,977
Mom and Dad sent you to be Big Sister.

448
00:26:01,061 --> 00:26:02,854
Well, I am your big sister.

449
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:05,106
Plus, I would've come on my own.

450
00:26:05,690 --> 00:26:06,690
Eventually.

451
00:26:07,108 --> 00:26:10,904
- Look, I know what you're going through.
- Trust me. You have no idea.

452
00:26:10,987 --> 00:26:12,364
This is hard for me too.

453
00:26:12,447 --> 00:26:14,824
I may not show it
the same way you do, but…

454
00:26:15,533 --> 00:26:16,534
My laptop!

455
00:26:16,618 --> 00:26:19,454
I didn't mean to spill the juice on it.
It was Louie's fault.

456
00:26:19,537 --> 00:26:21,915
Well, lucky for you, you missed.

457
00:26:22,665 --> 00:26:23,667
What?

458
00:26:25,251 --> 00:26:27,587
I didn't spill the juice on it this time,

459
00:26:27,671 --> 00:26:29,130
or slip on the skateboard.

460
00:26:31,841 --> 00:26:33,343
The nutcracker didn't break.

461
00:26:34,302 --> 00:26:36,388
It's like the day never happened.

462
00:26:36,471 --> 00:26:38,264
Everything just reset.

463
00:26:38,348 --> 00:26:42,686
But if everything resets,
then nobody remembers anything.

464
00:26:42,769 --> 00:26:44,688
I can change what happens!

465
00:26:44,771 --> 00:26:47,273
There's no consequences whatsoever.

466
00:26:48,566 --> 00:26:50,902
I can do whatever I want!

467
00:26:52,362 --> 00:26:55,907
Dear Santa, I really appreciate you
letting me relive Christmas

468
00:26:55,990 --> 00:26:59,494
over and over and over…

469
00:26:59,577 --> 00:27:02,372
Anyhoo,
if I'm gonna be stuck in this time loop,

470
00:27:02,455 --> 00:27:04,124
I'm gonna have some fun.

471
00:27:07,919 --> 00:27:09,671
It's sledding time.

472
00:27:09,754 --> 00:27:13,174
Okay, see you soon.
Merry Christmas.

473
00:27:28,565 --> 00:27:30,608
- Jokes for charity.
- Jokes for charity.

474
00:27:30,692 --> 00:27:32,819
- Get your jokes for charity.
- Jokes for charity.

475
00:27:32,902 --> 00:27:34,320
Get your jokes for charity.

476
00:27:34,404 --> 00:27:35,739
Get your jokes.

477
00:27:35,822 --> 00:27:37,949
Hi. Would you like to make a donation?

478
00:27:38,033 --> 00:27:41,411
You two must be new around here.
How about some advice instead?

479
00:27:41,995 --> 00:27:44,414
You see that girl over there?
That's Gretchen.

480
00:27:44,497 --> 00:27:48,001
She used to take my lunch money.
Do not try and sell her a joke.

481
00:27:48,084 --> 00:27:49,085
Thank you.

482
00:27:51,796 --> 00:27:56,176
Oh, oh! Oh, my eggs! Oh!

483
00:28:28,333 --> 00:28:30,168
Oh, cool!

484
00:28:37,509 --> 00:28:39,094
Ho, ho, ho!

485
00:28:39,678 --> 00:28:41,054
Uh, Tall Santa?

486
00:28:41,137 --> 00:28:42,806
You drive a limo too?

487
00:28:42,889 --> 00:28:45,100
Oh, yeah. Santa's side hustle, baby.

488
00:28:45,183 --> 00:28:47,143
I also cover a tech support hotline.

489
00:28:47,227 --> 00:28:50,313
Aha. Speaking of which, just one second.

490
00:28:51,272 --> 00:28:52,399
Tech support.

491
00:28:52,941 --> 00:28:54,401
Oh, yes.

492
00:28:54,484 --> 00:28:55,694
Yes!

493
00:28:55,777 --> 00:28:57,529
Yes!

494
00:28:57,612 --> 00:29:00,740
Oh, no, no, no. Have you tried restarting?

495
00:29:00,824 --> 00:29:02,409
Oh, my. It sounds like it's broken.

496
00:29:02,492 --> 00:29:03,910
Hold on just for one moment.

497
00:29:03,993 --> 00:29:06,204
I'll have to ask you to hold
just a second.

498
00:29:06,287 --> 00:29:10,291
Whew! Tough times.
Tough times. So what's the plan, Stan?

499
00:29:10,375 --> 00:29:12,669
- It's Ro.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

500
00:29:12,752 --> 00:29:14,045
Uh, what is your plan, Ro?

501
00:29:14,129 --> 00:29:16,631
And the plan is to have Christmas
like we used to.

502
00:29:16,715 --> 00:29:18,008
"Like we used to"?

503
00:29:18,091 --> 00:29:20,552
Don't you need more people for that?
Like your family?

504
00:29:20,635 --> 00:29:25,598
My family's a bit busy with other things,
so I'll just have to do it for them.

505
00:29:42,323 --> 00:29:44,325
Okay, Ro. You got this.

506
00:29:44,409 --> 00:29:45,994
It's just a little drop.

507
00:29:46,578 --> 00:29:52,000
No need to be scared!

508
00:29:57,630 --> 00:30:00,175
Get out of the way! Watch out!

509
00:30:10,310 --> 00:30:12,020
Sorry!

510
00:30:16,733 --> 00:30:17,901
Time to play.

511
00:30:17,984 --> 00:30:20,153
Let's see. What should I do first?

512
00:31:23,299 --> 00:31:24,634
Huh?

513
00:31:37,689 --> 00:31:39,190
Boo!

514
00:31:48,033 --> 00:31:50,118
Dad, Merry Christmas!

515
00:31:51,619 --> 00:31:52,871
Merry Christmas, sprout.

516
00:31:52,954 --> 00:31:55,123
- You and Louie have fun up there?
- I'll say.

517
00:31:55,206 --> 00:31:59,085
Thanks for sending him to wake me.
That kid is a real delight.

518
00:32:00,712 --> 00:32:02,172
- Yes!
- Up, over.

519
00:32:02,255 --> 00:32:04,424
Guess who decided to join us.

520
00:32:04,507 --> 00:32:05,800
Morning, sleepyhead.

521
00:32:05,884 --> 00:32:07,719
Rowena, Merry Christmas.

522
00:32:07,802 --> 00:32:11,222
Diane, Merry Christmas to you.

523
00:32:11,306 --> 00:32:12,932
Aw.

524
00:32:13,016 --> 00:32:15,226
Hand over the chocolate, lady,
and nobody gets hurt.

525
00:32:17,771 --> 00:32:20,732
Mmm. Mmm. Mmm.

526
00:32:21,649 --> 00:32:24,944
- I am getting notes of cinnamon…
- Mm-hmm.

527
00:32:25,528 --> 00:32:28,948
And a hint of victory.

528
00:32:34,371 --> 00:32:37,248
- Abuelita!
- Ah!

529
00:32:37,332 --> 00:32:40,001
We haven't opened present yet,
but between you and me,

530
00:32:40,627 --> 00:32:42,379
I love the sweater.

531
00:32:42,462 --> 00:32:44,214
Oh, my Rowena.

532
00:32:44,297 --> 00:32:45,715
All right. All right.

533
00:32:45,799 --> 00:32:47,592
You'll smother the poor girl.

534
00:32:47,676 --> 00:32:50,887
- Ro, are we having...
- Having a wonderful Christmas, Abuelo.

535
00:32:50,970 --> 00:32:52,263
Thank you for asking.

536
00:32:53,014 --> 00:32:54,474
Oops.

537
00:32:55,183 --> 00:32:56,393
Clumsy me.

538
00:32:56,935 --> 00:32:58,895
Gabby, could you be a dear
and go pick those up?

539
00:32:58,978 --> 00:33:03,316
Oh, Abuela, you're just so beautiful.

540
00:33:06,361 --> 00:33:09,989
Oh!

541
00:33:12,409 --> 00:33:15,161
How did she know
which boxes had all the chocolates?

542
00:33:15,245 --> 00:33:17,122
It's easy. I'm psychic.

543
00:33:17,205 --> 00:33:19,124
Ha! Funny, Ro.

544
00:33:19,874 --> 00:33:22,460
You're the one taking the comedy class,
Uncle Gerry.

545
00:33:23,086 --> 00:33:24,379
You told them?

546
00:33:24,462 --> 00:33:26,589
Okay, who wants to open presents?

547
00:33:26,673 --> 00:33:30,343
Yay! Let's do it, Mom.
I cannot wait for my new scrapbook.

548
00:33:30,927 --> 00:33:35,015
Or how about a makeup kit, Diane,
because you know me so well.

549
00:33:35,098 --> 00:33:39,185
And gee, Dad, I'd sure love that glove,
but Louie switched tags,

550
00:33:39,269 --> 00:33:42,105
so I guess I'll just settle
for a tablet with knobs.

551
00:33:42,188 --> 00:33:43,231
Oh.

552
00:33:43,815 --> 00:33:46,919
- You believe me now or need more proof?
- No, Ro, wait. That is enough, okay...

553
00:33:46,943 --> 00:33:48,236
More proof!

554
00:33:49,612 --> 00:33:53,324
Okay. First,
I'll just need to ask a few questions.

555
00:33:53,408 --> 00:33:55,452
Dad,
how much cash do you have in your pocket?

556
00:33:55,535 --> 00:33:59,122
Uh, it was $62.10.

557
00:33:59,205 --> 00:34:02,334
Okay. Um, Uncle Gerry,
what color is your underwear?

558
00:34:03,084 --> 00:34:04,294
My underwear?

559
00:34:04,377 --> 00:34:06,004
Just answer the question.

560
00:34:06,629 --> 00:34:08,006
Light blue.

561
00:34:08,089 --> 00:34:11,718
Eh, I'd say more robin's-egg blue.

562
00:34:11,801 --> 00:34:14,596
Would've been the same answer
if you asked yesterday.

563
00:34:14,679 --> 00:34:15,889
And Abuela?

564
00:34:16,556 --> 00:34:17,807
Who was your first crush?

565
00:34:18,975 --> 00:34:21,644
You don't need psychic powers
for that one, mija.

566
00:34:21,728 --> 00:34:23,688
- That would be...
- Antonio Diego.

567
00:34:24,564 --> 00:34:27,692
He had these green eyes,
the color of an old nickel

568
00:34:27,776 --> 00:34:30,612
and hair like a horse.

569
00:34:30,695 --> 00:34:32,155
- Diane.
- Mm-hmm?

570
00:34:32,238 --> 00:34:34,866
You're so good with dogs.
Did you ever have one?

571
00:34:34,949 --> 00:34:37,869
Uh, Ro, where are you going with this?

572
00:34:37,952 --> 00:34:40,872
I-I think it's nice
that Rowena wants to learn more about us.

573
00:34:40,955 --> 00:34:42,999
Yes, I did have a dog once.

574
00:34:43,083 --> 00:34:45,043
His name was Biscuit,

575
00:34:45,126 --> 00:34:47,504
and he was
this adorable little French bulldog,

576
00:34:47,587 --> 00:34:49,297
and I loved him so very much.

577
00:34:55,553 --> 00:34:58,181
And then one day
I left a bag of chips laying around.

578
00:34:59,349 --> 00:35:00,892
And I couldn't find Biscuit.

579
00:35:01,476 --> 00:35:04,104
And I went all over the house,
and I went, "Biscuit."

580
00:35:04,187 --> 00:35:06,439
- Okay, okay, okay.
- "Where are you? I'm so sorry."

581
00:35:06,523 --> 00:35:08,858
- Okay, Ro, I think that's plenty.
- Okay.

582
00:35:08,942 --> 00:35:10,402
You're right, Dad.

583
00:35:10,485 --> 00:35:11,861
I'll see you all next time.

584
00:35:19,536 --> 00:35:20,704
Huh?

585
00:35:23,873 --> 00:35:26,584
Good morning, Chicago!

586
00:35:26,668 --> 00:35:28,628
It's that day you've all been waiting for.

587
00:35:28,712 --> 00:35:31,297
- That's right. It is Christmas!
- Christmas!

588
00:35:31,381 --> 00:35:32,674
That's good, Rowena.

589
00:35:40,348 --> 00:35:43,351
Boo.

590
00:35:44,769 --> 00:35:47,105
$62.10.

591
00:35:51,901 --> 00:35:54,195
Uh, light blue,
the color of your underwear.

592
00:35:54,279 --> 00:35:56,823
But Bruce thinks
it's more of a robin's egg.

593
00:35:57,407 --> 00:36:00,118
- Either way, you should do your laundry.
- You see?

594
00:36:00,201 --> 00:36:01,786
I am very busy.

595
00:36:01,870 --> 00:36:04,372
- Oh, and Abuela?
- Hmm?

596
00:36:04,456 --> 00:36:06,708
I am so glad that you chose Abuelo over…

597
00:36:07,959 --> 00:36:09,502
Antonio Diego.

598
00:36:09,586 --> 00:36:11,296
Besides, it's only hair.

599
00:36:11,379 --> 00:36:12,964
Horse-hair Antonio?

600
00:36:14,758 --> 00:36:16,801
- Oh, and Diane?
- Uh-huh?

601
00:36:16,885 --> 00:36:18,219
Biscuit says hi.

602
00:36:19,429 --> 00:36:20,430
Biscuit?

603
00:36:20,513 --> 00:36:23,600
Yeah. The little French bulldog sitting
right next to you?

604
00:36:24,601 --> 00:36:26,311
He's got a bag of chips in his mouth,

605
00:36:26,394 --> 00:36:29,189
and he is not too happy
about you holding Olive.

606
00:36:34,694 --> 00:36:36,446
You will not get in here.

607
00:36:36,529 --> 00:36:38,156
Hey, can I get one of those?

608
00:36:38,239 --> 00:36:40,241
I've missed you so much.

609
00:36:46,498 --> 00:36:48,249
Time to spice things up.

610
00:36:52,921 --> 00:36:54,172
Merry Christmas.

611
00:36:54,255 --> 00:36:57,258
The Santas versus Elves, please.
And step on it.

612
00:36:57,342 --> 00:36:58,510
Mm-hmm.

613
00:37:01,388 --> 00:37:02,764
I'm Israel Idonije.

614
00:37:02,847 --> 00:37:04,349
And I'm Hosea Sanders.

615
00:37:04,432 --> 00:37:06,851
Welcome to Chicago's own
Santas versus Elves.

616
00:37:06,935 --> 00:37:09,187
The 25th Santaversary.

617
00:37:10,313 --> 00:37:13,775
Come on, Santas!
Throw some elbows! Get naughty!

618
00:37:13,858 --> 00:37:17,195
Well, the Santas
are really looking sluggish out there.

619
00:37:17,278 --> 00:37:19,656
That's what they get
for eating cookies all night.

620
00:37:19,739 --> 00:37:21,282
Oh, ow!

621
00:37:21,366 --> 00:37:24,035
I'm gonna need more snacks. Excuse me.

622
00:37:24,536 --> 00:37:28,164
- Congratulations, you two.
- How's it feel to win a thousand dollars?

623
00:37:28,248 --> 00:37:32,252
We can visit my parents in Florida.
This is the best Christmas ever!

624
00:37:32,335 --> 00:37:34,713
Excuse me.
Did they just win a thousand dollars?

625
00:37:34,796 --> 00:37:35,797
They sure did.

626
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:39,342
They guessed the closest number
of candy canes in that snowman,

627
00:37:39,426 --> 00:37:41,302
and they won the raffle.

628
00:37:41,386 --> 00:37:43,054
What was the winning number?

629
00:37:43,138 --> 00:37:44,305
Seventeen thousand…

630
00:37:44,389 --> 00:37:46,224
…five hundred and thirty-six.

631
00:37:46,307 --> 00:37:50,311
9,000 are red, 8,536 are green.

632
00:37:50,395 --> 00:37:52,439
How'd she do that?

633
00:37:53,189 --> 00:37:55,233
- I don't know, but…
- This is incredible.

634
00:37:55,316 --> 00:37:56,985
…what do you plan to do with your money?

635
00:38:07,704 --> 00:38:11,249
Merry Christmas again!

636
00:38:14,627 --> 00:38:16,046
That's so cool.

637
00:38:20,467 --> 00:38:21,468
Wow.

638
00:38:30,018 --> 00:38:31,686
Woo-hoo!

639
00:38:54,626 --> 00:38:56,336
Time to face my fear.

640
00:39:03,176 --> 00:39:04,260
Mm-mmm!

641
00:39:06,554 --> 00:39:08,014
Uh-uh. Mm-mmm.

642
00:39:10,350 --> 00:39:11,476
Mm-mmm!

643
00:39:21,319 --> 00:39:24,114
Woo! Crushed it.

644
00:39:25,907 --> 00:39:28,618
Hey, Santa, I did the big platform thingy.

645
00:39:28,702 --> 00:39:31,287
With enough practice,
you can learn to do anything

646
00:39:31,371 --> 00:39:33,957
and make things happen
the way you want them to.

647
00:39:59,983 --> 00:40:01,985
- The Santas versus Elves, please.
- Mm-hmm.

648
00:40:02,068 --> 00:40:05,488
Welcome to Chicago's own
Santas versus Elves.

649
00:40:05,572 --> 00:40:07,073
Take it! Take it!

650
00:40:17,542 --> 00:40:19,127
Go! Go!

651
00:40:26,551 --> 00:40:27,886
Ow!

652
00:40:29,304 --> 00:40:32,098
And the Elves score again!

653
00:40:32,891 --> 00:40:35,769
Will the Santas ever beat the Elves?

654
00:40:38,313 --> 00:40:40,774
The Elves have never looked tougher.

655
00:40:42,067 --> 00:40:43,943
They got a discount
for the short one?

656
00:40:45,278 --> 00:40:46,404
Bring it, Elves.

657
00:40:46,488 --> 00:40:49,824
That might be the littlest Santa
I have ever seen.

658
00:40:57,582 --> 00:41:00,293
Check out the hands on that little Santa!

659
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:01,961
Come on.

660
00:41:18,186 --> 00:41:21,439
Yes!

661
00:41:25,819 --> 00:41:28,822
- It's a miracle!
- Ho, ho! Ho, ho, ho!

662
00:41:28,905 --> 00:41:31,241
A Christmas miracle!

663
00:41:35,036 --> 00:41:37,317
- Yes. Here we go.
- We are gonna win this. It's our year.

664
00:41:37,372 --> 00:41:38,915
- Come on, Mom.
- This is our year.

665
00:41:40,333 --> 00:41:42,419
Hey, Ro, we're playing What's That?

666
00:41:42,502 --> 00:41:44,087
You can be on our team.

667
00:41:44,170 --> 00:41:45,630
It wouldn't be fair.

668
00:41:45,714 --> 00:41:48,508
Ro, sweetie, it's just a fun game,
and none of us are very good at it,

669
00:41:48,591 --> 00:41:52,512
except for Gabby.
And of course I draw for a living, so…

670
00:41:54,723 --> 00:41:56,516
Same time every Christmas.

671
00:41:56,599 --> 00:42:00,353
Don't worry. Me and Bruce will carry them
up to your room after this.

672
00:42:00,437 --> 00:42:02,272
You mean after we finish
kicking your butt.

673
00:42:02,355 --> 00:42:03,356
- Oh, ho!
- Oh!

674
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:04,500
- It's going down.
- No way.

675
00:42:04,524 --> 00:42:06,109
- A lot of big talk.
- We're gonna win.

676
00:42:06,693 --> 00:42:09,112
- Come on. Ro, sit.
- All right, we got this, Mom. Let's go!

677
00:42:09,195 --> 00:42:12,075
- Come on, Carolina. You got this!
- We're gonna win this time. Let's go!

678
00:42:12,115 --> 00:42:13,908
And go.

679
00:42:13,992 --> 00:42:15,869
- Okay.
- Planet.

680
00:42:15,952 --> 00:42:17,704
Yes. Good guess.

681
00:42:17,787 --> 00:42:18,997
- Nice, Ro.
- Okay.

682
00:42:19,080 --> 00:42:20,165
- Zoo.
- Wow.

683
00:42:20,248 --> 00:42:21,875
- Yes, that is also correct.
- Wow.

684
00:42:21,958 --> 00:42:23,626
- Toast.
- Yes.

685
00:42:23,710 --> 00:42:26,171
- Frog.
- Yes.

686
00:42:26,254 --> 00:42:28,048
- Bow tie.
- Yes.

687
00:42:28,131 --> 00:42:29,466
- Hit the road.
- Yes.

688
00:42:29,549 --> 00:42:30,759
- Two left feet.
- Yes.

689
00:42:30,842 --> 00:42:31,968
- Circus.
- Yes.

690
00:42:32,052 --> 00:42:33,845
- Green with envy.
- Yeah.

691
00:42:34,721 --> 00:42:35,805
- Palace.
- Uh-huh.

692
00:42:35,889 --> 00:42:37,640
- Close but no cigar.
- Yes.

693
00:42:37,724 --> 00:42:39,059
- Pinwheel.
- Yeah.

694
00:42:39,142 --> 00:42:40,727
- Raining cats and dogs.
- Yes.

695
00:42:40,810 --> 00:42:41,811
Time.

696
00:42:42,604 --> 00:42:43,897
Can we trade Louie for Ro?

697
00:42:43,980 --> 00:42:45,940
- No. No. She's on our team.
- No!

698
00:42:47,108 --> 00:42:48,401
- Do you want this money?
- Yes.

699
00:42:48,485 --> 00:42:51,404
- Give it back! Give it back.
- But that money's for charity!

700
00:42:51,488 --> 00:42:54,199
Maybe I have a charity of my own.
It's called Get Over It.

701
00:42:54,783 --> 00:42:55,867
Ooh.

702
00:42:57,869 --> 00:42:59,996
I can't say I didn't warn them.

703
00:43:00,080 --> 00:43:04,000
- Oh, oh! Oh, my eggs! Oh!
- Ooh.

704
00:43:12,550 --> 00:43:18,723
Welcome, everyone, to the 15th
annual Santa versus Elves hockey match.

705
00:43:18,807 --> 00:43:21,685
One hot cocoa, please.
And don't skimp on marshmallows.

706
00:43:21,768 --> 00:43:23,853
- I shan't skimp.
- Tall Santa?

707
00:43:23,937 --> 00:43:25,480
Weren't you just driving the limo?

708
00:43:25,563 --> 00:43:29,401
Yes, of course I was, but as you can see,
I am a man of many hats.

709
00:43:29,484 --> 00:43:32,404
Even tiny little elf hats
that tend to make my head itch.

710
00:43:33,113 --> 00:43:35,657
- So, is your family meeting you here?
- They're still busy,

711
00:43:35,740 --> 00:43:39,035
but I pretty much know everyone here
so it's almost like we're family.

712
00:43:39,119 --> 00:43:41,162
Isn't that right, Frankie?

713
00:43:41,246 --> 00:43:42,247
What?

714
00:43:42,914 --> 00:43:45,542
Uh, how do you know…

715
00:43:47,502 --> 00:43:48,503
Weird.

716
00:43:50,213 --> 00:43:53,341
Um… …she's just nervous

717
00:43:53,425 --> 00:43:56,219
'cause she's proposing to her boyfriend
at the Winterfest tonight.

718
00:43:56,302 --> 00:43:58,930
- Oh, that's sweet.
- Yeah.

719
00:43:59,014 --> 00:44:04,060
Too bad an ornament's gonna fall
from the tree and "shatter" her moment.

720
00:44:04,144 --> 00:44:06,104
Oh! Well, that's not sweet.

721
00:44:06,187 --> 00:44:08,148
Why don't you, uh,
go give her a little heads up?

722
00:44:08,231 --> 00:44:10,275
Eh, I've been busy.

723
00:44:10,358 --> 00:44:12,902
I'm reliving
my favorite Christmas memories.

724
00:44:12,986 --> 00:44:14,320
Fun, I'll give you that,

725
00:44:14,404 --> 00:44:18,116
but aren't some of those favorite
Christmas memories involving your family?

726
00:44:18,199 --> 00:44:23,288
Well, yeah, but I don't know, Santa.

727
00:44:24,122 --> 00:44:25,874
Everything's different this year.

728
00:44:25,957 --> 00:44:30,837
My dad brought his girlfriend
and her little boy, who is a nightmare.

729
00:44:31,379 --> 00:44:33,506
Things just aren't the same
with my family.

730
00:44:33,590 --> 00:44:35,300
Yeah, yeah, I hear you.

731
00:44:35,383 --> 00:44:40,013
You know, once upon a time,
the North Pole was a quiet little place

732
00:44:40,096 --> 00:44:44,851
back when it was just me and Mrs. Claus
and Dasher and Dancer.

733
00:44:45,477 --> 00:44:48,688
Smash cut to today
and there are nine hungry reindeer

734
00:44:48,772 --> 00:44:51,399
and a thousand noisy elves.

735
00:44:51,483 --> 00:44:54,027
My point is families change.

736
00:44:54,736 --> 00:44:59,491
But what's important
is you're all still together on Christmas.

737
00:44:59,574 --> 00:45:02,160
Yeah,
but I don't want my family to change.

738
00:45:02,243 --> 00:45:05,580
And Christmas was so much better
before Mom and Dad split.

739
00:45:05,663 --> 00:45:06,956
Yeah, well, maybe so,

740
00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:10,377
but while you're running around
trying to relive the past,

741
00:45:10,460 --> 00:45:12,921
think of all the fun new memories
you're missing out on.

742
00:45:13,004 --> 00:45:17,759
Besides, Ro,
they will always be your mom and dad

743
00:45:18,718 --> 00:45:20,470
even if they're not together.

744
00:45:23,807 --> 00:45:25,725
Why didn't I think of this sooner?

745
00:45:25,809 --> 00:45:27,811
I could get Mom and Dad back together.

746
00:45:27,894 --> 00:45:32,399
What? So that's, that, that's, that's
your takeaway from... from all of this?

747
00:45:32,982 --> 00:45:35,360
Yes. This could solve everything.

748
00:45:35,944 --> 00:45:37,570
Okay, Ro, well, all right.

749
00:45:37,654 --> 00:45:40,949
One hot chocolate, extra marshmallow.

750
00:45:41,616 --> 00:45:43,034
And thanks, Tall...

751
00:45:45,203 --> 00:45:46,830
Uh, Tall Santa?

752
00:45:48,873 --> 00:45:49,874
Weird.

753
00:45:53,086 --> 00:45:54,421
- Hey, Mom?
- Hi, sweetie.

754
00:45:54,504 --> 00:45:57,966
If you had to pick one Christmas
to live over again, which would it be?

755
00:45:58,049 --> 00:46:01,469
Hmm. That's interesting. Why do you ask?

756
00:46:01,553 --> 00:46:03,054
Just wondering.

757
00:46:03,138 --> 00:46:06,182
If you had to,
which Christmas would you relive?

758
00:46:07,142 --> 00:46:11,312
Well, my favorite Christmas…

759
00:46:11,396 --> 00:46:13,023
…would be your first Christmas.

760
00:46:13,106 --> 00:46:14,774
- My first Christmas?
- Mm-hmm.

761
00:46:14,858 --> 00:46:17,819
You were nine months old.
It was also our first Christmas here.

762
00:46:17,902 --> 00:46:19,362
Your mom and I planned a party.

763
00:46:19,446 --> 00:46:21,698
We spent two days
getting the place together.

764
00:46:21,781 --> 00:46:26,369
We didn't have much furniture,
but we had a tree and Christmas lights

765
00:46:26,453 --> 00:46:28,830
and a wreath for the door,

766
00:46:28,913 --> 00:46:32,250
and we had these horrible,
ugly, matching Christmas…

767
00:46:32,334 --> 00:46:35,003
…sweatshirts.
They were absolutely hideous.

768
00:46:35,086 --> 00:46:38,089
- Oh. And of course nobody could come.
- Why not?

769
00:46:38,173 --> 00:46:41,176
A big storm came in out of nowhere,
snowed in the whole block.

770
00:46:41,259 --> 00:46:44,012
We lost power. No TV, no lights.

771
00:46:44,095 --> 00:46:46,598
Fortunately,
your mom kept a box of candles.

772
00:46:46,681 --> 00:46:49,059
And we lit every single one.

773
00:46:49,934 --> 00:46:51,770
And the place was just…

774
00:46:53,313 --> 00:46:55,065
…spectacular.

775
00:46:55,148 --> 00:46:58,318
And your mom and I sat
drinking hot cocoa and telling stories

776
00:46:58,401 --> 00:47:00,236
while Gabriella played with her toys,

777
00:47:00,320 --> 00:47:02,781
and you crawled around on the rug
like a little crocodile.

778
00:47:02,864 --> 00:47:06,117
It was just the four of us then,
and things were so much simpler.

779
00:47:06,785 --> 00:47:08,286
- Those were… - Great times.

780
00:47:09,579 --> 00:47:12,624
I know what I have to do.

781
00:47:18,588 --> 00:47:23,885
First things first,
let's get rid of any distractions.

782
00:47:31,559 --> 00:47:34,354
Here, kitty, kitty, kitty.

783
00:47:35,313 --> 00:47:37,273
Come here, Cupcake.

784
00:47:37,357 --> 00:47:39,401
Come here, Cupcake.

785
00:47:40,568 --> 00:47:43,196
I know you're around here somewhere.

786
00:47:43,279 --> 00:47:45,365
I've been hearing you meow.

787
00:47:48,451 --> 00:47:50,328
Here, kitty, kitty, kitty.

788
00:47:50,412 --> 00:47:52,330
Come on, Cupcake.

789
00:47:54,749 --> 00:47:57,168
There you are,
you little runaway.

790
00:48:08,596 --> 00:48:10,390
I'm gonna need more tuna.

791
00:48:16,563 --> 00:48:17,689
That ought to do it.

792
00:48:20,525 --> 00:48:21,985
Ooh. Nice catch.

793
00:48:34,372 --> 00:48:35,999
Eye on the ball.

794
00:48:36,833 --> 00:48:37,834
Nice.

795
00:48:39,210 --> 00:48:41,546
That was great! Good job, Louie!

796
00:48:48,178 --> 00:48:49,304
Diane, are you okay?

797
00:48:51,681 --> 00:48:52,891
Oh, my gosh.

798
00:48:52,974 --> 00:48:54,851
Okay, okay. I got you. Let's go upstairs.

799
00:48:54,934 --> 00:48:57,312
- Come on, Louie.
- Now, easy. Easy, easy, easy.

800
00:48:57,896 --> 00:48:58,897
Oh, boy.

801
00:48:58,980 --> 00:49:00,732
Oh, my! What happened?

802
00:49:00,815 --> 00:49:02,359
It's just a sneezing fit.

803
00:49:04,402 --> 00:49:06,279
- Okay.
- Maybe we should get Doc?

804
00:49:06,363 --> 00:49:08,156
- Yes.
- No. I'll be fine.

805
00:49:08,239 --> 00:49:11,618
Just let him enjoy his Christmas.
I just need to take a deep breath.

806
00:49:13,745 --> 00:49:15,497
Oh!

807
00:49:15,580 --> 00:49:17,123
Uh, we have medicine.

808
00:49:17,207 --> 00:49:18,541
Oh, no thank you.

809
00:49:18,625 --> 00:49:21,503
No, thank you, sweetheart.
That stuff makes me sleepy.

810
00:49:21,586 --> 00:49:24,047
Honey, your nose is lighting up
like Rudolph.

811
00:49:24,130 --> 00:49:26,424
I think sleepiness
is the last of your worries.

812
00:49:26,508 --> 00:49:27,717
But I don't wanna miss...

813
00:49:30,261 --> 00:49:31,304
Okay.

814
00:49:34,766 --> 00:49:37,185
Okay. I-I think I'm gonna get you
a cold washcloth,

815
00:49:37,268 --> 00:49:39,187
and then you can lay down
in the guest room.

816
00:49:39,270 --> 00:49:40,271
- Yes, yes.
- Yeah.

817
00:49:40,355 --> 00:49:41,395
- Okay, here we go.
- Okay.

818
00:49:41,439 --> 00:49:43,358
Got it, got it, got it, got it.

819
00:49:46,069 --> 00:49:47,195
Feel better!

820
00:49:54,160 --> 00:49:56,830
One down, three to go.

821
00:49:59,624 --> 00:50:00,768
- I know they love it.
- How do you know?

822
00:50:00,792 --> 00:50:02,544
Did you see her face?

823
00:50:02,627 --> 00:50:05,267
- I seen her face. Is it?
- That's the only gift that she did love.

824
00:50:05,338 --> 00:50:06,339
- Hello?
- Hello?

825
00:50:06,423 --> 00:50:08,466
Am I speaking to Olive's daddy?

826
00:50:08,550 --> 00:50:09,634
I'm sorry. Who's this?

827
00:50:09,718 --> 00:50:12,220
I found this adorable little dog,

828
00:50:12,303 --> 00:50:17,392
and her tag says, "I'm Olive.
If I'm lost please contact my daddy."

829
00:50:18,018 --> 00:50:22,731
Poor girl was whimpering at my door.
She seemed so hungry and helpless.

830
00:50:22,814 --> 00:50:23,815
- Car keys?
- Who is it?

831
00:50:23,898 --> 00:50:25,668
I'll be right there.
I'll tell you in the car.

832
00:50:25,692 --> 00:50:28,445
We'll be right there. We're heading out
right now. Thank you so much.

833
00:50:33,825 --> 00:50:35,118
Hey, where have you been?

834
00:50:35,201 --> 00:50:37,245
Playing. Where is everybody?

835
00:50:37,328 --> 00:50:40,165
Diane's asleep in the guest room,
and your uncles went to go get Olive.

836
00:50:40,248 --> 00:50:43,168
Little stink ball ran off this morning
and got an hour out of town.

837
00:50:43,251 --> 00:50:45,545
Oh, my! Poor thing.

838
00:50:45,628 --> 00:50:47,315
Thankfully,
your grandparents are still here.

839
00:50:47,339 --> 00:50:49,299
- Okay, can you help me finish the dishes?
- Yeah.

840
00:50:50,175 --> 00:50:52,969
And the grandparents will be asleep
by What's That,

841
00:50:53,053 --> 00:50:54,763
which leaves only one.

842
00:51:03,146 --> 00:51:05,857
Hey, Louie. Wanna see something cool?

843
00:51:07,275 --> 00:51:08,276
All right.

844
00:51:08,360 --> 00:51:10,195
But why do we have to be in the bathroom?

845
00:51:10,278 --> 00:51:13,323
Because it's the best reception
in the whole house.

846
00:51:13,406 --> 00:51:16,159
Observe. You can watch whatever you want.

847
00:51:16,242 --> 00:51:19,871
Whoa. Even scary things
like a shark ripping off a man's head

848
00:51:19,954 --> 00:51:24,209
and the man comes back
as a zombie and eats the shark?

849
00:51:24,292 --> 00:51:25,752
I like your vision.

850
00:51:25,835 --> 00:51:27,337
Let's see what we can find.

851
00:51:32,300 --> 00:51:37,639
But my mom says if I watch scary things,
I'll have bad dreams.

852
00:51:37,722 --> 00:51:41,101
Something tells me
you'll forget everything by morning.

853
00:52:10,714 --> 00:52:13,341
Uh, I just got off the phone
with the electric company.

854
00:52:13,425 --> 00:52:15,010
They can't send anyone until morning.

855
00:52:15,093 --> 00:52:18,304
Ah, that makes sense.
It is Christmas.

856
00:52:18,388 --> 00:52:20,741
On the bright side, the place
does look great with all these candles.

857
00:52:20,765 --> 00:52:22,392
Mmm. It was Ro's idea.

858
00:52:23,935 --> 00:52:25,854
You know, it kind of reminds me of...

859
00:52:25,937 --> 00:52:27,248
- Our first Christmas here.
- Yes! Yes!

860
00:52:27,272 --> 00:52:28,565
I was thinking the same thing.

861
00:52:28,648 --> 00:52:31,484
I made hot cocoas.

862
00:52:32,485 --> 00:52:35,739
Mom, Dad, sit. Enjoy yourselves.

863
00:52:35,822 --> 00:52:37,282
You've both earned it.

864
00:52:38,033 --> 00:52:39,200
Love you.

865
00:52:39,284 --> 00:52:40,285
- Okay.
- Um…

866
00:52:41,703 --> 00:52:43,038
- How did she… - I don't know.

867
00:52:43,121 --> 00:52:44,622
- This is insane.
- I know. There's...

868
00:52:44,706 --> 00:52:45,749
You must have taught her.

869
00:52:45,832 --> 00:52:47,292
Really beautiful.

870
00:52:48,376 --> 00:52:50,295
Gosh. Oh, uh, thanks, Sprout!

871
00:52:50,378 --> 00:52:51,463
Thank you.

872
00:52:54,716 --> 00:52:56,343
- Where's everybody?
- Shh.

873
00:52:56,426 --> 00:52:58,428
Mom and Dad are having a moment.

874
00:53:00,847 --> 00:53:02,307
- This is amazing.
- Right? I know.

875
00:53:02,390 --> 00:53:03,516
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

876
00:53:03,600 --> 00:53:05,268
- It's coziness in a cup.
- Yeah.

877
00:53:05,352 --> 00:53:06,353
It's working.

878
00:53:07,103 --> 00:53:08,396
What are you doing?

879
00:53:08,480 --> 00:53:10,607
I'm making mom and dad fall in love again.

880
00:53:10,690 --> 00:53:12,776
All they needed
was some time to themselves.

881
00:53:12,859 --> 00:53:14,611
You are such a baby.

882
00:53:14,694 --> 00:53:17,947
Mom and Dad aren't getting back together,
and you need to accept that.

883
00:53:18,031 --> 00:53:20,158
And you need to have a little faith.

884
00:53:20,742 --> 00:53:21,910
Observe.

885
00:53:21,993 --> 00:53:24,996
What are you… doing?

886
00:53:25,080 --> 00:53:26,790
Um…

887
00:53:26,873 --> 00:53:28,708
Lina, I know today
couldn't have been easy.

888
00:53:28,792 --> 00:53:30,585
Are you sure it's okay if we sleep over?

889
00:53:30,669 --> 00:53:32,337
What am I gonna do?
Kick you out now?

890
00:53:33,254 --> 00:53:34,714
I'm kidding.

891
00:53:34,798 --> 00:53:37,759
Besides, I think it's good for the girls
to see us all getting along,

892
00:53:37,842 --> 00:53:40,053
especially on Christmas.

893
00:53:43,556 --> 00:53:45,725
Um… is that mistletoe?

894
00:53:45,809 --> 00:53:48,395
Why do I have the feeling
we are being watched?

895
00:53:48,478 --> 00:53:50,146
Let the smooching begin.

896
00:53:52,273 --> 00:53:54,567
That's it? No, no, no, no, no.

897
00:53:54,651 --> 00:53:56,027
That can't be it.

898
00:53:56,111 --> 00:53:57,821
Yeah, you're a real cupid.

899
00:53:57,904 --> 00:54:00,073
Gabby pie, did you put up this mistletoe?

900
00:54:00,156 --> 00:54:02,367
Nope, that would be…

901
00:54:02,450 --> 00:54:03,743
- Rowena!
- Rowena!

902
00:54:03,827 --> 00:54:05,453
This might be harder than I thought.

903
00:54:06,913 --> 00:54:09,666
Dad,
some kids at my school are going steady.

904
00:54:09,749 --> 00:54:11,501
They brag about having their own song.

905
00:54:11,584 --> 00:54:13,962
- Kids still say "going steady"?
- Bear with me, Dad.

906
00:54:14,045 --> 00:54:16,715
I'm trying to speak in terms
that you can relate to.

907
00:54:16,798 --> 00:54:19,884
Anyway, did you and Mom ever have a song?

908
00:54:19,968 --> 00:54:21,344
We had a wedding song.

909
00:54:21,428 --> 00:54:23,346
Really? What song?

910
00:54:23,430 --> 00:54:25,515
What was Dad like
when you were first married?

911
00:54:26,307 --> 00:54:28,059
What was it you liked about him?

912
00:54:28,143 --> 00:54:29,936
He was always very handy.

913
00:54:30,020 --> 00:54:31,938
He designed this house, you know.

914
00:54:32,022 --> 00:54:34,149
Anytime anything needed fixing,
he was there.

915
00:54:34,232 --> 00:54:37,193
And I always thought that that was very…

916
00:54:38,403 --> 00:54:39,571
impressive.

917
00:54:39,654 --> 00:54:40,739
Impressive.

918
00:54:41,740 --> 00:54:42,741
Nice.

919
00:55:03,678 --> 00:55:06,139
- What are you guys eating?
- Mmm?

920
00:55:09,684 --> 00:55:12,854
Yeah, that should do it.
Merry Christmas.

921
00:55:12,937 --> 00:55:14,230
Thank you.

922
00:55:20,945 --> 00:55:22,072
Whoa!

923
00:55:32,248 --> 00:55:34,084
You might wanna take a shower.

924
00:55:45,303 --> 00:55:46,596
Jackpot.

925
00:55:46,680 --> 00:55:49,182
Thanks for the help.

926
00:55:50,016 --> 00:55:51,768
See you by the fire.

927
00:55:51,851 --> 00:55:53,687
Love, C.

928
00:56:03,321 --> 00:56:06,658
"Thanks for all your help.
See you by the fire. Love, C."

929
00:56:07,283 --> 00:56:08,284
Hmm.

930
00:56:11,162 --> 00:56:12,872
Did you need something?

931
00:56:14,207 --> 00:56:17,544
- I was wondering if you could be my model.
- Ro, I have so much I have to do.

932
00:56:17,627 --> 00:56:19,629
This was my present from Diane.

933
00:56:19,713 --> 00:56:22,716
I wanna show her
how much I appreciate her gift.

934
00:56:22,799 --> 00:56:24,634
Oh. Well, that's nice, honey.

935
00:56:24,718 --> 00:56:27,220
It will only take a second, I promise.

936
00:56:29,097 --> 00:56:30,098
Okay.

937
00:56:32,267 --> 00:56:33,518
How do I look?

938
00:56:34,936 --> 00:56:39,315
The important question is how do you feel?

939
00:56:44,446 --> 00:56:46,823
Beau...

940
00:56:47,782 --> 00:56:49,200
Like I escaped from the circus.

941
00:56:49,284 --> 00:56:51,786
I guess that answers both questions.

942
00:56:54,622 --> 00:56:56,791
And if your client gets
a little too jumpy,

943
00:56:56,875 --> 00:56:59,878
tell them you're just enhancing
what's already there.

944
00:57:00,462 --> 00:57:02,380
You are beautiful.

945
00:57:04,966 --> 00:57:07,093
Huh. Not bad.

946
00:57:08,011 --> 00:57:09,179
What do you think?

947
00:57:09,262 --> 00:57:10,680
I think I need more tools.

948
00:57:10,764 --> 00:57:12,265
Pat, pat, pat.

949
00:57:12,349 --> 00:57:14,642
A little pat, pat, pat.

950
00:57:14,726 --> 00:57:17,103
And there you have it. You are all set.

951
00:57:17,187 --> 00:57:21,232
Now, listen, all of this is fun
and looking beautiful is fantastic.

952
00:57:21,316 --> 00:57:26,446
Just remember that you are beautiful
on the inside, and that is what counts.

953
00:57:27,238 --> 00:57:28,448
Perfect.

954
00:57:28,531 --> 00:57:31,618
Mmm. Where did you learn all this stuff?

955
00:57:31,701 --> 00:57:33,703
It's makeup, Mom, not rocket science.

956
00:57:33,787 --> 00:57:36,539
Now, hold still so I can finish
contouring your nose.

957
00:57:36,623 --> 00:57:38,041
But I like my nose.

958
00:57:38,124 --> 00:57:42,295
I do too.
We're just enhancing what's already there.

959
00:57:42,379 --> 00:57:43,380
Okay.

960
00:57:44,923 --> 00:57:46,675
And voilà.

961
00:57:48,677 --> 00:57:51,680
Wow, Ro. Huh.

962
00:57:52,639 --> 00:57:54,057
And one last thing.

963
00:57:54,641 --> 00:57:57,560
Oh! Oh!

964
00:57:59,396 --> 00:58:00,855
Bad idea.

965
00:58:00,939 --> 00:58:01,940
Bad idea.

966
00:58:02,023 --> 00:58:03,358
- Very bad.
- Bad idea!

967
00:58:03,441 --> 00:58:05,985
Very bad idea.

968
00:58:12,242 --> 00:58:14,202
I just got off the phone with the...

969
00:58:15,745 --> 00:58:18,665
Oh, my. I can't believe
you still have these things.

970
00:58:18,748 --> 00:58:21,835
Look how adorable you two look.

971
00:58:21,918 --> 00:58:23,294
I made hot cocoas.

972
00:58:24,504 --> 00:58:26,423
Mom, Dad, sit.

973
00:58:26,506 --> 00:58:28,508
Enjoy yourselves. You've earned it.

974
00:58:28,591 --> 00:58:29,592
Okay.

975
00:58:30,927 --> 00:58:31,928
Thanks, Sprout.

976
00:58:34,764 --> 00:58:35,765
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

977
00:58:38,184 --> 00:58:39,185
Where is everybody?

978
00:58:40,145 --> 00:58:41,563
It's yours if you help me.

979
00:58:41,646 --> 00:58:44,357
- Well, aside from the power outage…
- Mm-hmm.

980
00:58:44,441 --> 00:58:46,568
…the sneezing fits
and the dog disappearance…

981
00:58:46,651 --> 00:58:48,291
- Mm-hmm.
- …today wasn't a total disaster.

982
00:58:49,863 --> 00:58:52,782
On the bright side, the place looks great
with all these candles.

983
00:58:52,866 --> 00:58:54,868
Mmm. It was Ro's idea.

984
00:58:55,869 --> 00:58:58,496
You know, it kinda reminds me of our f...

985
00:58:58,580 --> 00:59:00,123
- Our first Christmas here.
- Yeah.

986
00:59:00,206 --> 00:59:02,083
- I was just thinking the same thing.
- I know.

987
00:59:04,419 --> 00:59:05,420
Wow.

988
00:59:06,880 --> 00:59:08,173
Hey!

989
00:59:08,757 --> 00:59:10,216
Dad, we want to dance.

990
00:59:10,300 --> 00:59:11,301
- Okay!
- Come on!

991
00:59:11,384 --> 00:59:13,571
Who needs power when you can
play music from your phone?

992
00:59:13,595 --> 00:59:15,138
- Right?
- What you got?

993
00:59:15,638 --> 00:59:17,349
Yeah, Gabs.

994
00:59:18,099 --> 00:59:19,517
- There we go.
- Yeah.

995
00:59:19,601 --> 00:59:21,186
- Come on, Ro.
- Do one foot in and out.

996
00:59:21,978 --> 00:59:23,521
- Oh, okay, Mike.
- Look at that.

997
00:59:25,648 --> 00:59:28,193
Hey! Shake it low!

998
00:59:28,276 --> 00:59:29,444
- Oh! Oh!
- Get low!

999
00:59:29,527 --> 00:59:31,404
Whoa! Whoa! Hey!

1000
00:59:33,573 --> 00:59:35,325
There you go, Mom. It's okay, you're fine.

1001
00:59:39,954 --> 00:59:42,332
Hey. Whoa.

1002
00:59:48,380 --> 00:59:49,923
- Oh.
- Oh.

1003
00:59:50,006 --> 00:59:51,132
- Come on.
- Mmm.

1004
00:59:52,258 --> 00:59:53,843
I love this song.

1005
00:59:53,927 --> 00:59:55,970
I'd hope so.
You picked it for our wedding.

1006
00:59:56,054 --> 00:59:58,640
- Mmm. That's right, I did.
- You did.

1007
00:59:59,182 --> 01:00:02,185
- Oh. I've got good taste.
- You do.

1008
01:00:08,483 --> 01:00:09,859
Ooh. Oh.

1009
01:00:11,027 --> 01:00:13,571
Wow!

1010
01:00:14,239 --> 01:00:15,615
- What is going on?
- What?

1011
01:00:17,325 --> 01:00:18,326
Seriously?

1012
01:00:20,662 --> 01:00:24,374
Who put a remote control fan
on the mantle?

1013
01:00:25,333 --> 01:00:26,334
What?

1014
01:00:27,794 --> 01:00:28,920
Seriously?

1015
01:00:29,004 --> 01:00:30,588
What is happening to this place?

1016
01:00:33,049 --> 01:00:36,094
- Crazy.
- I feel that this is my new look.

1017
01:00:37,971 --> 01:00:41,057
It turns out the house is still a work
in progress even after all these years.

1018
01:00:41,141 --> 01:00:44,853
It's too bad I can't find the guy
who designed the place.

1019
01:00:44,936 --> 01:00:46,771
- Oh, wait.
- Touché.

1020
01:00:47,939 --> 01:00:50,108
What are you doing?

1021
01:00:55,196 --> 01:00:57,032
Is that mistletoe?

1022
01:00:59,200 --> 01:01:02,412
Why do I have the feeling
we are being watched?

1023
01:01:03,830 --> 01:01:05,248
- Girls?
- Girls?

1024
01:01:05,331 --> 01:01:09,336
You know, I feel bad taking your money.
But not bad enough not to take it.

1025
01:01:10,879 --> 01:01:14,382
But they're supposed to kiss.
They're supposed to fall in love.

1026
01:01:14,466 --> 01:01:16,843
Things are supposed to go back
to how they used to be.

1027
01:01:17,594 --> 01:01:20,722
Ro, that's never gonna happen, okay?
It doesn't matter what you do.

1028
01:01:20,805 --> 01:01:23,183
You don't know that.
You don't know what I can do.

1029
01:01:23,266 --> 01:01:26,561
- Dad's getting re-married.
- You're lying! It's not true.

1030
01:01:26,644 --> 01:01:28,563
Mike.

1031
01:01:31,149 --> 01:01:32,233
Come on.

1032
01:01:41,659 --> 01:01:43,036
It is true, Sprout.

1033
01:01:43,703 --> 01:01:46,956
I asked Diane to marry me,
and she said yes.

1034
01:01:48,375 --> 01:01:49,834
Why didn't anybody tell me?

1035
01:01:49,918 --> 01:01:53,546
Honey, we wanted to.
Our plan was to wait until the new year.

1036
01:01:54,547 --> 01:01:55,548
Why?

1037
01:01:56,925 --> 01:02:00,053
Because we didn't wanna ruin
your Christmas.

1038
01:02:01,346 --> 01:02:02,472
Oh.

1039
01:02:03,723 --> 01:02:06,101
Rowena, honey, it's gonna be okay.

1040
01:02:06,184 --> 01:02:10,063
But I-I miss our family.
I miss the way it used to be.

1041
01:02:10,146 --> 01:02:12,148
I know. I know you do, sweetie.

1042
01:02:13,858 --> 01:02:15,485
And it's okay to be sad.

1043
01:02:17,195 --> 01:02:19,489
But hey, hey, we all love you.

1044
01:02:20,240 --> 01:02:23,618
And this just means
that our family is growing

1045
01:02:23,702 --> 01:02:26,037
and there'll be even more people
who love you.

1046
01:02:26,121 --> 01:02:27,872
I don't want more people to love me.

1047
01:02:29,499 --> 01:02:30,709
Rowena, honey.

1048
01:02:32,460 --> 01:02:34,421
- Mike.
- I…

1049
01:02:39,092 --> 01:02:41,094
Merry Christmas, sleepyhead.

1050
01:02:42,178 --> 01:02:46,433
Don't you wanna get up?
Maybe run a brush through your hair?

1051
01:02:47,142 --> 01:02:49,477
Why, Mom? What's the point?

1052
01:02:49,561 --> 01:02:51,938
Honey, because it's Christmas.
And you're a kid.

1053
01:02:53,231 --> 01:02:54,774
What are you reading?

1054
01:02:54,858 --> 01:02:55,984
"A Christmas Carol."

1055
01:02:56,609 --> 01:03:00,280
It's about this guy, Ebenezer,
and everyone's giving him a hard time.

1056
01:03:00,864 --> 01:03:01,948
But he's not so bad.

1057
01:03:03,199 --> 01:03:05,535
He just wants things to be the way
they always were.

1058
01:03:06,202 --> 01:03:09,748
Is that what it's about?
Sounds like you need to keep reading.

1059
01:03:10,290 --> 01:03:11,624
But not right this minute.

1060
01:03:11,708 --> 01:03:16,087
Your father and Diane are here,
so get your butt downstairs. Vámonos.

1061
01:03:22,594 --> 01:03:24,554
Guess who decided to join us.

1062
01:03:27,015 --> 01:03:28,099
Ro?

1063
01:03:45,784 --> 01:03:47,077
Everything okay, Sprout?

1064
01:03:47,911 --> 01:03:52,290
Yep, it's Christmas.
The gift that keeps on giving.

1065
01:03:52,374 --> 01:03:53,458
Yay.

1066
01:04:00,173 --> 01:04:01,966
Ew.

1067
01:04:04,135 --> 01:04:05,720
Does anybody else see this?

1068
01:04:06,388 --> 01:04:08,723
- ¿Qué?
- Ro is drawing the Mona Lisa.

1069
01:04:09,391 --> 01:04:12,268
- Yeah, Hector, I'm sure it's great.
- No, I mean literally.

1070
01:04:13,061 --> 01:04:14,396
It's the Mona Lisa.

1071
01:04:20,151 --> 01:04:21,152
I'm out.

1072
01:04:24,030 --> 01:04:25,156
- Louie! Louie! Louie!
- No!

1073
01:04:28,326 --> 01:04:29,327
No.

1074
01:04:51,224 --> 01:04:53,852
This tastes delicious.

1075
01:05:00,442 --> 01:05:03,903
Oh, ho, ho!

1076
01:05:14,998 --> 01:05:17,667
Good morning, Chicago!

1077
01:05:17,751 --> 01:05:19,794
It's that day you've all been waiting for.

1078
01:05:19,878 --> 01:05:21,046
It's us, Bruce.

1079
01:05:21,921 --> 01:05:24,150
This is nice. No, this is going
to go great in the condo.

1080
01:05:24,174 --> 01:05:26,485
- It's gonna match our coffee table colors.
- Papi, those socks.

1081
01:05:26,509 --> 01:05:27,594
Thank you, Pop!

1082
01:05:27,677 --> 01:05:29,846
- Mike, is there any trash over there?
- Oh, yeah.

1083
01:05:30,472 --> 01:05:34,184
Yeah. And then smart. And then…

1084
01:05:34,267 --> 01:05:36,936
- Under the table.
- Ro! Ro! Hey, come here.

1085
01:05:37,437 --> 01:05:38,521
- Rowena!
- Hey, sweetie,

1086
01:05:38,605 --> 01:05:41,691
- don't you wanna open your presents?
- Yeah. Sprout, what's the matter?

1087
01:05:41,775 --> 01:05:44,819
- I just don't believe in it anymore.
- You don't believe in what, sweetie?

1088
01:05:44,903 --> 01:05:46,529
I don't believe in Christmas.

1089
01:05:46,613 --> 01:05:48,656
- What?
- Louie, cover your ears.

1090
01:05:49,199 --> 01:05:52,035
Rowena, you don't mean that.

1091
01:05:52,118 --> 01:05:55,455
Christmas is the most wonderful time
of year.

1092
01:05:55,538 --> 01:05:56,581
- Yes.
- Is it, Abuela?

1093
01:05:56,664 --> 01:05:58,625
- Yes.
- Really? What's so wonderful about it?

1094
01:05:58,708 --> 01:06:01,002
- Um, presents, duh.
- Yeah, Ro.

1095
01:06:01,086 --> 01:06:02,212
What about presents?

1096
01:06:02,295 --> 01:06:05,382
Uncle Bruce, do you even remember
what you got me last year?

1097
01:06:05,465 --> 01:06:07,300
Sure, I do.

1098
01:06:07,384 --> 01:06:09,803
- It was a... It was...
- Oh, Rowena.

1099
01:06:11,513 --> 01:06:12,639
What'd I get her?

1100
01:06:13,973 --> 01:06:18,144
Yeah, I'm sure I loved it
but I can't remember what it was either.

1101
01:06:18,228 --> 01:06:19,813
None of us need these presents,

1102
01:06:19,896 --> 01:06:22,148
so what's the point
of doing it every year?

1103
01:06:22,232 --> 01:06:25,485
Honey, it's not about the presents,
it's about the thought behind them.

1104
01:06:25,568 --> 01:06:29,239
And what about all the other great things
about Christmas?

1105
01:06:29,322 --> 01:06:30,573
- Like Christmas trees.
- Yeah.

1106
01:06:30,657 --> 01:06:31,700
- Yeah.
- Yes.

1107
01:06:31,783 --> 01:06:33,410
Look at this tree, Uncle Gerry.

1108
01:06:33,493 --> 01:06:36,287
If you really think about it,
it's probably sad.

1109
01:06:36,371 --> 01:06:39,332
One day, it was in the woods
minding its own business

1110
01:06:39,416 --> 01:06:42,127
and then some jerk comes along
and chops it down.

1111
01:06:42,210 --> 01:06:45,296
And now it's in our house
and we've covered it with lights

1112
01:06:45,380 --> 01:06:47,257
and festive decorations.

1113
01:06:47,340 --> 01:06:49,694
How would you like it
if someone brought you into their house

1114
01:06:49,718 --> 01:06:52,595
and covered you in lights
and festive decorations?

1115
01:06:52,679 --> 01:06:55,765
I wouldn't like it. Not one bit.

1116
01:06:55,849 --> 01:06:57,142
Thank you, Louie.

1117
01:06:57,976 --> 01:07:00,937
Face it, you guys. Christmas is overrated.

1118
01:07:01,021 --> 01:07:02,022
Ro.

1119
01:07:04,858 --> 01:07:07,277
Hey, big guy.
I know we haven't chatted in a minute,

1120
01:07:07,360 --> 01:07:09,404
but I could really use your help.

1121
01:07:09,487 --> 01:07:12,907
Thanks for the Christmas wish,
it's been a lot of fun.

1122
01:07:12,991 --> 01:07:18,038
But could you please make it stop now?
Your friend, Rowena.

1123
01:07:19,748 --> 01:07:22,292
Hey, Mom?
Can you mail this to the North Pole?

1124
01:07:22,375 --> 01:07:26,421
Oh, honey, the post office is closed today
but we can mail it tomorrow.

1125
01:07:26,504 --> 01:07:30,675
- Tomorrow. Tomorrow. Tomorrow. Tomorrow.
- No!

1126
01:07:34,846 --> 01:07:38,516
No!

1127
01:07:42,520 --> 01:07:47,067
No!

1128
01:07:54,366 --> 01:07:55,367
Hey, you!

1129
01:07:55,450 --> 01:07:57,369
I need you to take back the wish,
you hear me?

1130
01:07:57,452 --> 01:08:00,080
I've had enough! Take it back!

1131
01:08:07,671 --> 01:08:10,715
Hey, what are you doing up here?
Everyone's downstairs.

1132
01:08:11,925 --> 01:08:13,009
What do you care?

1133
01:08:15,970 --> 01:08:17,681
Mom and Dad are worried about you.

1134
01:08:18,556 --> 01:08:20,517
Don't you care about their feelings?

1135
01:08:21,476 --> 01:08:24,062
Nobody asks me about my feelings.

1136
01:08:25,897 --> 01:08:27,023
Yeah, well,

1137
01:08:27,732 --> 01:08:30,568
you're not the only one going through
a rough time right now, you know.

1138
01:08:32,445 --> 01:08:35,281
I-I miss the way things were
just as much as you do.

1139
01:08:37,367 --> 01:08:40,370
But you're younger than me, right? So…

1140
01:08:41,830 --> 01:08:43,832
you don't remember what it was like.

1141
01:08:45,834 --> 01:08:49,170
You don't have to remember
all of the fighting.

1142
01:08:52,048 --> 01:08:55,719
But everyone's happier now.
You know, families change.

1143
01:08:56,511 --> 01:09:01,057
I'm not happier, okay?
I don't want our family to change.

1144
01:09:01,975 --> 01:09:03,226
I know.

1145
01:09:03,852 --> 01:09:05,562
And I didn't either.

1146
01:09:08,148 --> 01:09:10,817
But in a way, it kind of already did.

1147
01:09:12,652 --> 01:09:13,862
The day you were born,

1148
01:09:15,613 --> 01:09:16,948
everything changed.

1149
01:09:17,824 --> 01:09:21,077
You know, you were new and I...
I definitely didn't like it,

1150
01:09:21,161 --> 01:09:23,913
but I saw how happy you made Mom and Dad.

1151
01:09:25,790 --> 01:09:29,169
So, I decided to give you a chance,

1152
01:09:31,046 --> 01:09:34,257
even though you annoy
the heck out of me most of the time.

1153
01:09:36,009 --> 01:09:37,927
You'll always be my little sister.

1154
01:09:40,096 --> 01:09:42,098
And I wouldn't change that for anything.

1155
01:09:44,184 --> 01:09:47,270
Everything's gonna be okay.
All right? I promise.

1156
01:09:55,195 --> 01:09:58,656
I'm sorry I took your laptop.
And your sketchbook.

1157
01:10:00,241 --> 01:10:03,453
- You're a really good artist.
- Okay, you don't have to say that.

1158
01:10:03,995 --> 01:10:05,580
But thanks.

1159
01:10:07,165 --> 01:10:09,250
Come on, let's go downstairs.

1160
01:10:09,334 --> 01:10:10,960
Gabby.

1161
01:10:11,503 --> 01:10:13,630
I think I'll give new people a chance too.

1162
01:10:14,547 --> 01:10:16,675
But only because
I've tried everything else.

1163
01:10:16,758 --> 01:10:17,759
Come on.

1164
01:10:21,721 --> 01:10:24,224
Okay, Bruce. Okay, Bruce. Do it!
Pumpernickel bread.

1165
01:10:24,307 --> 01:10:26,267
It's too big. Make it smaller.

1166
01:10:26,351 --> 01:10:27,602
Is that a mariachi band?

1167
01:10:27,686 --> 01:10:30,271
- Does that look like a mariachi band?
- It is a mariachi band.

1168
01:10:30,355 --> 01:10:31,690
It's a shark!

1169
01:10:32,774 --> 01:10:34,275
Doc, it's your favorite!

1170
01:10:36,444 --> 01:10:38,113
Mariachi?

1171
01:10:39,280 --> 01:10:41,491
Oh, it is a mariachi band! Hey!

1172
01:10:42,992 --> 01:10:44,160
What?

1173
01:10:54,421 --> 01:10:56,798
- Whoo!
- Whoo-hoo!

1174
01:10:56,881 --> 01:10:58,091
Oh, my God!

1175
01:10:58,842 --> 01:11:01,845
You see! Hey, hey, it's a mariachi band!

1176
01:11:29,330 --> 01:11:31,791
- Did you know it was me?
- I was totally surprised.

1177
01:11:31,875 --> 01:11:33,209
Do you wanna be the ghost?

1178
01:11:34,544 --> 01:11:35,712
Not really.

1179
01:11:37,380 --> 01:11:38,465
Hey, Louie?

1180
01:11:39,424 --> 01:11:40,342
Boo!

1181
01:11:40,425 --> 01:11:41,926
That was so good!

1182
01:11:42,010 --> 01:11:43,803
Let's go downstairs. It's Christmas.

1183
01:11:43,887 --> 01:11:45,805
Hang on. Your shoelace is untied.

1184
01:11:46,723 --> 01:11:48,933
- Thanks, Rowena.
- You're welcome, Louie.

1185
01:11:49,517 --> 01:11:51,644
I got you, you little devil.

1186
01:11:51,728 --> 01:11:52,854
Incoming!

1187
01:11:52,937 --> 01:11:56,024
Huh? Whoa! Hey!
What is this, a wrestling match?

1188
01:11:56,107 --> 01:11:58,336
All right, which one of you is The Rock
and which one of you is John Cena?

1189
01:11:58,360 --> 01:11:59,903
- I don't know.
- I'm Rock.

1190
01:11:59,986 --> 01:12:01,821
- Over up. Over...
- Yes! Like that. Yes!

1191
01:12:01,905 --> 01:12:04,741
- Guess who decided to join us.
- Morning, sleepyhead.

1192
01:12:04,824 --> 01:12:05,992
Morning, everyone.

1193
01:12:06,076 --> 01:12:07,952
Rowena, Merry Christmas.

1194
01:12:08,036 --> 01:12:10,246
Your dad told me
that you made the softball team.

1195
01:12:10,330 --> 01:12:12,832
That is amazing!
What position do you play?

1196
01:12:12,916 --> 01:12:16,378
Shortstop,
but coach wants me to practice pitching.

1197
01:12:16,461 --> 01:12:17,962
That is incredible, sweetie.

1198
01:12:18,546 --> 01:12:21,132
Well, then you're going
to especially love your present today.

1199
01:12:21,216 --> 01:12:23,093
- Diane, don't ruin it.
- I know.

1200
01:12:23,677 --> 01:12:26,429
Well, let's just say it's really
gonna help you out on the team.

1201
01:12:26,513 --> 01:12:29,307
Sorry, Sprout. She's just excited
'cause she picked it out herself.

1202
01:12:30,183 --> 01:12:31,267
Whoa.

1203
01:12:31,935 --> 01:12:33,812
- Diane picked out the glove?
- Yeah.

1204
01:12:34,604 --> 01:12:36,106
- Wait. What?
- How did she know?

1205
01:12:37,649 --> 01:12:38,775
Cool.

1206
01:12:38,858 --> 01:12:40,860
Oh, my little Rowena.

1207
01:12:43,613 --> 01:12:46,157
Did you like your sweater?
I made it myself.

1208
01:12:46,241 --> 01:12:48,159
We haven't opened presents yet, Mom.

1209
01:12:48,243 --> 01:12:50,161
- Oh.
- But I bet I'm gonna love it.

1210
01:12:50,245 --> 01:12:51,746
And look what I made you.

1211
01:12:51,830 --> 01:12:54,416
It's an herbal tea.
I found it in the kitchen.

1212
01:12:54,499 --> 01:12:56,339
It's supposed to be great
for your upset tummy.

1213
01:13:01,256 --> 01:13:02,716
- Nice.
- Give it back!

1214
01:13:02,799 --> 01:13:03,943
- It's mine now.
- Give it back!

1215
01:13:03,967 --> 01:13:05,927
Stop. What are you gonna use with it?

1216
01:13:07,345 --> 01:13:08,430
Gretchen.

1217
01:13:09,472 --> 01:13:12,100
- But that money's for charity!
- Maybe I got a charity of my own.

1218
01:13:12,183 --> 01:13:13,518
It's called "Get Over It."

1219
01:13:14,102 --> 01:13:16,646
- That's enough, Gretchen.
- And what are you gonna do about it?

1220
01:13:23,069 --> 01:13:24,195
That's enough, Gretchen.

1221
01:13:24,279 --> 01:13:26,072
And what are you gonna do about it?

1222
01:13:28,408 --> 01:13:29,909
It's a Christmas present.

1223
01:13:32,120 --> 01:13:33,705
Now give them their money back.

1224
01:13:47,052 --> 01:13:48,803
We're ready to learn Judo.

1225
01:13:49,929 --> 01:13:51,097
Okay.

1226
01:13:55,935 --> 01:13:57,520
A great man once said,

1227
01:13:57,604 --> 01:14:00,732
"It is not important to be better
than someone else

1228
01:14:00,815 --> 01:14:02,942
but to be better than yesterday."

1229
01:14:03,443 --> 01:14:04,444
Is that not true?

1230
01:14:04,527 --> 01:14:05,945
- Yes, sensei.
- Yes, sensei.

1231
01:14:06,029 --> 01:14:07,364
Begin!

1232
01:14:07,447 --> 01:14:08,907
Hiyah!

1233
01:14:08,990 --> 01:14:10,825
Hiyah! Hiyah!

1234
01:14:11,451 --> 01:14:12,786
Hiyah!

1235
01:14:14,746 --> 01:14:16,122
I'm telling my mommy!

1236
01:14:16,206 --> 01:14:17,290
- Yes!
- Whoo!

1237
01:14:18,291 --> 01:14:20,669
- I believe this is yours.
- Thank you.

1238
01:14:20,752 --> 01:14:24,089
And I believe this is yours. On the house.

1239
01:14:24,172 --> 01:14:25,632
Wyatt, take it away.

1240
01:14:25,715 --> 01:14:28,718
- What did one plate say to another plate?
- I give up.

1241
01:14:28,802 --> 01:14:30,845
Dinner's on me!

1242
01:14:30,929 --> 01:14:32,639
Is this your little brother?

1243
01:14:32,722 --> 01:14:34,974
Yeah. That's right.

1244
01:14:36,101 --> 01:14:39,270
It's Christmas. Why the heck are you guys
out here selling jokes?

1245
01:14:39,354 --> 01:14:43,149
It makes us feel good to help others.
That's what Christmas is about.

1246
01:14:43,233 --> 01:14:45,068
Daddy says
everyone should do what they can.

1247
01:14:45,151 --> 01:14:46,611
Every little bit helps.

1248
01:15:18,143 --> 01:15:19,394
Oh, oh, oh!

1249
01:15:19,477 --> 01:15:21,980
Goodness! I almost dropped my eggs.

1250
01:15:22,063 --> 01:15:23,940
- We wouldn't want that, Mrs. Brown.
- Oh.

1251
01:15:24,024 --> 01:15:26,026
- Now, let me help you cross the street.
- Oh.

1252
01:15:27,027 --> 01:15:29,154
Nice to see you again!

1253
01:15:29,237 --> 01:15:30,447
How're you doing?

1254
01:15:31,239 --> 01:15:32,949
Hello.

1255
01:15:33,950 --> 01:15:35,994
Oh! Andy, amazing cookies.

1256
01:15:37,120 --> 01:15:39,330
Brenda, you can stop checking your phone.

1257
01:15:39,414 --> 01:15:41,916
Spoiler alert, he doesn't call.

1258
01:15:42,876 --> 01:15:45,545
Hey! Merry Christmas, Will.
Merry Christmas, Elise.

1259
01:15:45,628 --> 01:15:47,797
Have fun visiting your parents in Florida.

1260
01:15:47,881 --> 01:15:49,174
Who was that?

1261
01:15:49,257 --> 01:15:50,842
Oh, Phil, hold my stuff.

1262
01:15:50,925 --> 01:15:51,925
What?

1263
01:15:53,219 --> 01:15:54,637
Winston, will you...

1264
01:15:59,392 --> 01:16:02,079
- That totally would have hit her.
- How'd you know that would happen?

1265
01:16:02,103 --> 01:16:05,440
Don't you have a better question,
you know, to ask him?

1266
01:16:06,024 --> 01:16:08,276
Right. Marry me?

1267
01:16:09,069 --> 01:16:10,153
Yes.

1268
01:16:12,113 --> 01:16:13,365
My work here is done.

1269
01:16:42,560 --> 01:16:43,770
Hey Santa,

1270
01:16:43,853 --> 01:16:47,023
I just want to thank you
for showing me the true meaning of family.

1271
01:16:47,107 --> 01:16:48,650
Thanks for the lessons, big guy.

1272
01:16:48,733 --> 01:16:50,985
Now, I think I've got some people
to go help.

1273
01:16:52,779 --> 01:16:56,449
Jokes for charity. Get your jokes, people.
There's enough for everyone.

1274
01:16:57,826 --> 01:17:00,537
Hi. I'd like to buy one joke, please.

1275
01:17:02,414 --> 01:17:03,957
- Knock, knock.
- Who's there?

1276
01:17:04,040 --> 01:17:05,917
- The interrupting cow.
- Interrupting cow...

1277
01:17:06,001 --> 01:17:08,503
Moo!

1278
01:17:08,586 --> 01:17:12,382
Come on, Cupcake. I've got tuna.

1279
01:17:20,265 --> 01:17:22,100
Was that Rowena?

1280
01:17:22,183 --> 01:17:25,395
- Cupcake. Oh, my gosh, it's a miracle!
- Oh!

1281
01:17:27,564 --> 01:17:28,940
What's this?

1282
01:17:36,573 --> 01:17:38,408
Hello, precious.

1283
01:17:39,284 --> 01:17:41,244
I've never... I've never seen it.

1284
01:17:41,327 --> 01:17:43,079
It's the best Christmas movie.

1285
01:17:43,788 --> 01:17:45,248
Ro, what're you doing?

1286
01:17:45,331 --> 01:17:46,833
Oh. Just being helpful.

1287
01:17:46,916 --> 01:17:49,336
Wouldn't want anyone to break their neck.

1288
01:17:49,419 --> 01:17:51,421
- Thank you!
- Did you hear what she said?

1289
01:17:51,504 --> 01:17:54,382
It's the best present
I could ever think of. Good daughter.

1290
01:17:54,466 --> 01:17:56,009
Raised right.

1291
01:17:56,092 --> 01:17:57,761
Oh.

1292
01:17:57,844 --> 01:17:58,887
So?

1293
01:17:59,554 --> 01:18:01,264
Diane, these are great.

1294
01:18:01,348 --> 01:18:02,432
- Really?
- Told you.

1295
01:18:02,515 --> 01:18:03,516
Yay!

1296
01:18:03,600 --> 01:18:08,480
Carolina, your father and I
want to give you something very special.

1297
01:18:11,483 --> 01:18:15,403
This has been
in our family for generations.

1298
01:18:15,487 --> 01:18:18,615
Gracias, mami. Thank you.
I love it. Love it!

1299
01:18:18,698 --> 01:18:19,783
Ew!

1300
01:18:21,868 --> 01:18:25,872
Come on. Get it, Olive. Get it.
Come on. Get it, Olive. Come. Get it.

1301
01:18:26,956 --> 01:18:29,501
Do it! Do it! Do it!

1302
01:18:29,584 --> 01:18:34,089
Okay, just be kind, you know?
It's still a work in progress.

1303
01:18:36,007 --> 01:18:37,801
Well, here goes nothing.

1304
01:18:41,096 --> 01:18:42,847
You can do it, Uncle Gerry.

1305
01:18:42,931 --> 01:18:44,849
Hey, you're the funniest person I know.

1306
01:18:45,433 --> 01:18:46,685
You got this.

1307
01:18:47,227 --> 01:18:48,353
Okay.

1308
01:18:50,355 --> 01:18:53,733
So, I'm a lawyer, right?
As you already know.

1309
01:18:53,817 --> 01:18:55,610
And the hardest part of being a lawyer

1310
01:18:55,694 --> 01:18:58,071
is turning off work mode
when you get home.

1311
01:18:59,489 --> 01:19:00,699
Hey, Gerry?

1312
01:19:00,782 --> 01:19:02,200
Wait, that's supposed to be me?

1313
01:19:02,701 --> 01:19:04,470
- I don't sound nothin' like that.
- Oh, my God!

1314
01:19:04,494 --> 01:19:07,098
- Do you mind taking the garbage out?
- You know I don't talk like that.

1315
01:19:07,122 --> 01:19:08,498
- Who that is?
- But, Gerry,

1316
01:19:08,581 --> 01:19:10,875
I took the garbage out last week.

1317
01:19:13,753 --> 01:19:18,049
Objection! Argumentative.
I motion to dismiss!

1318
01:19:18,133 --> 01:19:19,884
Whoo!

1319
01:19:21,261 --> 01:19:22,762
- Yeah!
- Hey, hey!

1320
01:19:22,846 --> 01:19:25,056
- He's pretty good!
- He did good!

1321
01:19:25,598 --> 01:19:27,017
What did I tell you?

1322
01:19:27,100 --> 01:19:29,894
You killed it. You killed it.

1323
01:19:29,978 --> 01:19:31,187
I love you.

1324
01:19:33,148 --> 01:19:34,190
Hey.

1325
01:19:34,691 --> 01:19:36,067
Thanks, Ro.

1326
01:19:38,611 --> 01:19:40,321
Speak for yourself.

1327
01:19:40,405 --> 01:19:42,323
I've taken a few art classes in my day.

1328
01:19:42,407 --> 01:19:44,868
Yeah, I've seen his work, you guys.
He's a real Picasso.

1329
01:19:49,831 --> 01:19:51,624
Merry Christmas, Carolina!

1330
01:19:51,708 --> 01:19:53,668
- I baked banana bread.
- Oh, my. Thank you.

1331
01:19:53,752 --> 01:19:55,086
You didn't have to do that.

1332
01:19:55,170 --> 01:19:57,940
We wouldn't have had the ingredients
if it weren't for your little Rowena.

1333
01:19:57,964 --> 01:20:00,467
Is she here? We wanted to say thank you.

1334
01:20:00,550 --> 01:20:03,595
Okay, yep, just come in.
Come in. Yeah, sure. She's right... Okay.

1335
01:20:06,723 --> 01:20:08,933
Hey, Carolina. I made bread pudding.

1336
01:20:09,017 --> 01:20:10,268
I know it's Ro's favorite.

1337
01:20:10,352 --> 01:20:11,978
She brought our Cupcake home.

1338
01:20:12,062 --> 01:20:14,856
And the best Christmas gift ever.
Two new little babies.

1339
01:20:14,939 --> 01:20:16,816
You raised the most wonderful girl.

1340
01:20:16,900 --> 01:20:18,860
- Can we say hello?
- Oh. Yeah, okay.

1341
01:20:19,569 --> 01:20:20,987
Bread... Bread pudding, okay.

1342
01:20:24,616 --> 01:20:26,785
Merry Christmas!

1343
01:20:26,868 --> 01:20:28,453
Let me guess, Ro?

1344
01:20:29,287 --> 01:20:31,873
If we have a girl,
we're naming her Rowena.

1345
01:20:31,956 --> 01:20:34,250
Let's not put the cart before the horse.

1346
01:20:34,334 --> 01:20:36,378
- Can we?
- Yep. Just... Yep. Yep. Come in.

1347
01:20:36,461 --> 01:20:37,962
Yep. Take that. Okay.

1348
01:20:39,464 --> 01:20:40,548
When was she at Winterfest?

1349
01:20:40,632 --> 01:20:42,967
Hi!

1350
01:20:47,597 --> 01:20:48,597
- Ah.
- Hmm?

1351
01:20:51,559 --> 01:20:52,602
Come in.

1352
01:20:52,686 --> 01:20:54,729
Hi.

1353
01:20:55,563 --> 01:20:58,358
Rowena, do you mind explaining to me
what is happening?

1354
01:20:58,441 --> 01:20:59,901
How is any of this possible?

1355
01:20:59,984 --> 01:21:01,695
Time is a tricky thing.

1356
01:21:01,778 --> 01:21:03,655
A lot can happen in a day.

1357
01:21:04,239 --> 01:21:05,657
Well, I g...

1358
01:21:07,158 --> 01:21:08,159
Here we go.

1359
01:21:13,081 --> 01:21:14,082
Hi.

1360
01:21:15,250 --> 01:21:17,502
Hi. Oh. You're having a party.

1361
01:21:17,585 --> 01:21:18,503
- Oh.
- Sorry to interrupt.

1362
01:21:18,586 --> 01:21:20,964
No, no, no, not at all. How can I help?

1363
01:21:21,631 --> 01:21:24,259
I'm Henry. These are my kids.
We just wanted...

1364
01:21:24,342 --> 01:21:26,344
Mom, these are my new friends,
Holly and Wyatt.

1365
01:21:26,428 --> 01:21:28,406
Come on, guys. I wanna show you
my uncles' new dog.

1366
01:21:28,430 --> 01:21:29,597
Hey.

1367
01:21:34,769 --> 01:21:37,564
Ro helped them raise money
for the foundation today.

1368
01:21:37,647 --> 01:21:40,233
Oh. I'm sorry, the foundation?

1369
01:21:40,316 --> 01:21:41,943
It's just a small charity.

1370
01:21:42,444 --> 01:21:44,320
The kids lost their mom a while back.

1371
01:21:44,404 --> 01:21:46,489
Oh. I'm-I'm so sorry to hear that.

1372
01:21:47,323 --> 01:21:49,451
Anyway, we just moved to the neighborhood.

1373
01:21:49,993 --> 01:21:51,494
- Welcome.
- Thank you.

1374
01:21:52,120 --> 01:21:54,873
I just think it's so nice
the way they've already made friends.

1375
01:21:54,956 --> 01:21:56,332
Yeah. Oh, good.

1376
01:21:59,002 --> 01:22:00,253
This is my mom.

1377
01:22:00,337 --> 01:22:01,880
- Hi, Mom. I'm Henry.
- Hola.

1378
01:22:01,963 --> 01:22:03,798
Nice to meet you, Henry.

1379
01:22:03,882 --> 01:22:05,258
- Carolina?
- Yeah?

1380
01:22:05,342 --> 01:22:08,261
Why are you keeping
our handsome guest in the doorway?

1381
01:22:08,345 --> 01:22:11,598
Oh, oh. Yes, come in. Sorry, come in.

1382
01:22:11,681 --> 01:22:12,891
Thank you.

1383
01:22:13,391 --> 01:22:14,392
Mom.

1384
01:22:19,356 --> 01:22:20,523
Okay.

1385
01:22:22,942 --> 01:22:26,154
That's so good!

1386
01:22:26,237 --> 01:22:28,573
That's hysterical. That's so funny.

1387
01:22:28,656 --> 01:22:32,327
Mushroom. I get it. It's a mush, mushroom.

1388
01:22:33,703 --> 01:22:35,372
Try my stepmom's kale cookies.

1389
01:22:35,455 --> 01:22:39,000
It sounds weird, I know,
but it's surprisingly delicious.

1390
01:22:39,084 --> 01:22:41,711
And the green makes it super Christmassy.

1391
01:22:42,253 --> 01:22:44,589
- Okay. Thank you.
- Wow, thanks.

1392
01:22:44,673 --> 01:22:45,882
Merry Christmas.

1393
01:22:49,803 --> 01:22:51,971
I'm the stepmom. I'm her stepmom.

1394
01:22:52,055 --> 01:22:54,057
- Can I help? There's so many people.
- Yes.

1395
01:22:54,140 --> 01:22:55,809
- Hallelujah!
- All right.

1396
01:22:55,892 --> 01:22:57,519
Thank you. We have so many people.

1397
01:22:57,602 --> 01:22:58,895
Thank you so much.

1398
01:22:59,646 --> 01:23:01,314
Thank you. It's beautiful.

1399
01:23:01,398 --> 01:23:05,068
What do you call a room with no doors?

1400
01:23:05,860 --> 01:23:07,362
Anyone? Anyone?

1401
01:23:08,697 --> 01:23:10,073
A mushroom.

1402
01:23:10,699 --> 01:23:11,741
Right?

1403
01:23:15,286 --> 01:23:16,847
Who wants cocoa? Do you want some cocoa?

1404
01:23:16,871 --> 01:23:17,991
- I want some.
- Yes, please.

1405
01:23:18,039 --> 01:23:19,749
Okay. Let's have some cocoa while we cook.

1406
01:23:21,876 --> 01:23:23,420
It's a latke, Pop.

1407
01:23:30,051 --> 01:23:31,052
Mazel tov!

1408
01:23:31,136 --> 01:23:32,387
- Yeah!
- Hey!

1409
01:23:32,470 --> 01:23:34,055
Okay, okay, okay.

1410
01:23:34,139 --> 01:23:36,641
Give me two of the latkes
with no sour cream.

1411
01:23:36,725 --> 01:23:38,184
All right, here we go.

1412
01:23:42,564 --> 01:23:44,649
You know what?
You guys can make whatever you want.

1413
01:23:44,733 --> 01:23:46,901
- Yes!
- Just use your imagination.

1414
01:23:51,448 --> 01:23:52,782
What's up?

1415
01:23:54,659 --> 01:23:55,660
What's this?

1416
01:23:57,203 --> 01:23:58,413
Ro…

1417
01:23:58,496 --> 01:24:00,415
I used my savings.

1418
01:24:02,500 --> 01:24:05,086
- A tablet?
- This one doesn't come with knobs.

1419
01:24:06,171 --> 01:24:08,423
But, Ro, I didn't get you anything.

1420
01:24:08,506 --> 01:24:10,342
You were there for me when I needed you.

1421
01:24:11,092 --> 01:24:12,469
I couldn't ask for more.

1422
01:24:12,969 --> 01:24:14,596
Or a better big sister.

1423
01:24:15,889 --> 01:24:17,557
Merry Christmas, Gabby.

1424
01:24:18,350 --> 01:24:19,768
Merry Christmas, Ro.

1425
01:24:19,851 --> 01:24:20,935
Come here.

1426
01:24:23,188 --> 01:24:24,939
- I love you.
- Love you too.

1427
01:24:29,110 --> 01:24:31,696
I'm so glad you all ended up here tonight.

1428
01:24:32,197 --> 01:24:34,199
I did a lot today, you guys.

1429
01:24:34,282 --> 01:24:36,785
I mean a lot. A lot.

1430
01:24:37,994 --> 01:24:41,247
But one thing I haven't done
is thank my family.

1431
01:24:41,331 --> 01:24:42,582
Oh.

1432
01:24:42,665 --> 01:24:46,086
Rowena, this is so unlike you.

1433
01:24:46,169 --> 01:24:47,587
I-I know, it's sappy.

1434
01:24:48,171 --> 01:24:52,217
But it's also Christmas, and none of you
will remember this, anyway.

1435
01:24:52,300 --> 01:24:54,094
That's why we have cameras, honey.

1436
01:24:54,844 --> 01:24:56,054
- Yes!
- Yes, Uncle Bruce!

1437
01:24:56,554 --> 01:25:02,185
So, a long time ago someone wise told me
that Christmas isn't only about tradition.

1438
01:25:02,268 --> 01:25:05,689
It's about spending time
with the people you care about.

1439
01:25:06,356 --> 01:25:08,149
I said that yesterday.

1440
01:25:08,233 --> 01:25:10,443
I was getting to that, Mom!
Quit hogging the limelight.

1441
01:25:10,527 --> 01:25:12,654
- Oh.
- My bad.

1442
01:25:12,737 --> 01:25:17,325
And you were right,
because here we all are,

1443
01:25:18,326 --> 01:25:19,369
together…

1444
01:25:20,245 --> 01:25:21,579
and I've never been happier.

1445
01:25:21,663 --> 01:25:24,416
Oh. I'm gonna cry.

1446
01:25:24,499 --> 01:25:28,670
I've seen a lot of Christmases in my time.
I mean, a lot. A lot.

1447
01:25:30,046 --> 01:25:33,633
But this one definitely tops the list.

1448
01:25:34,342 --> 01:25:35,760
Yeah!

1449
01:25:36,594 --> 01:25:38,972
I love you.

1450
01:25:39,055 --> 01:25:41,599
- Who's ready for some Christmas carols?
- Yeah!

1451
01:25:41,683 --> 01:25:43,184
All right, here we go.

1452
01:25:43,268 --> 01:25:45,645
- The Christmas cookies were great.
- Yeah.

1453
01:25:45,729 --> 01:25:47,355
Bread pudding looks like mine.

1454
01:26:55,757 --> 01:26:57,092
Hi, honey.

1455
01:26:58,134 --> 01:27:01,513
Oh. A Christmas Carol.

1456
01:27:02,013 --> 01:27:03,682
My favorite. Are you reading this?

1457
01:27:03,765 --> 01:27:05,100
I finished it this morning.

1458
01:27:05,183 --> 01:27:06,685
What'd you think?

1459
01:27:06,768 --> 01:27:08,186
I get why it's a classic.

1460
01:27:09,187 --> 01:27:13,483
Some parts were a little scary,
but he needed to go through it.

1461
01:27:13,566 --> 01:27:15,151
And why is that?

1462
01:27:15,235 --> 01:27:17,696
So that he could become a better person.

1463
01:27:17,779 --> 01:27:20,990
Someone who isn't afraid of
letting new people in.

1464
01:27:21,866 --> 01:27:23,493
It's never too late for a reset.

1465
01:27:24,994 --> 01:27:27,038
How did I get the smartest girl?

1466
01:27:28,248 --> 01:27:29,374
- Hey, Mom?
- Hmm?

1467
01:27:29,457 --> 01:27:30,959
I had a great Christmas.

1468
01:27:31,960 --> 01:27:34,170
Even if you don't remember
any of it tomorrow…

1469
01:27:34,963 --> 01:27:37,549
- I'm happy.
- Honey, what are you talking about?

1470
01:27:37,632 --> 01:27:39,217
Of course I'll remember it.

1471
01:27:39,300 --> 01:27:42,012
But just in case you don't…

1472
01:27:43,596 --> 01:27:45,265
I'm still glad we had today.

1473
01:27:45,348 --> 01:27:47,225
I'm happy too, Rowena.

1474
01:27:48,101 --> 01:27:49,936
Merry Christmas.

1475
01:27:51,771 --> 01:27:53,064
All right.

1476
01:27:55,567 --> 01:27:58,319
Buenas noches, my little niñita.

1477
01:27:58,403 --> 01:27:59,863
Buenas noches, Mama.

1478
01:28:19,924 --> 01:28:21,259
Wake up. Wake up.

1479
01:28:21,343 --> 01:28:23,595
Thank goodness
we can retire this song until next year!

1480
01:28:23,678 --> 01:28:26,348
Louie? Where's your white sheet?

1481
01:28:26,431 --> 01:28:27,974
- You wanna play ghost?
- No.

1482
01:28:28,516 --> 01:28:30,143
Is it still Christmas?

1483
01:28:30,226 --> 01:28:31,936
Christmas was yesterday.

1484
01:28:33,980 --> 01:28:35,273
It's over.

1485
01:28:36,191 --> 01:28:39,569
Christmas is finally over! Whoo!

1486
01:28:40,236 --> 01:28:43,323
Christmas is finally over! Whoo!

1487
01:28:46,743 --> 01:28:48,078
Mom!

1488
01:28:48,161 --> 01:28:49,746
- Mom?
- Dad?

1489
01:28:50,246 --> 01:28:52,040
- Mike!
- Let's check outside.

1490
01:28:52,582 --> 01:28:54,000
Good idea.

1491
01:29:00,799 --> 01:29:03,426
There you are, Sprout.
We were about to find you to say goodbye.

1492
01:29:03,510 --> 01:29:04,636
You're leaving already?

1493
01:29:04,719 --> 01:29:06,304
Why? You haven't had enough of us?

1494
01:29:06,805 --> 01:29:08,640
I'm so glad you came, Diane.

1495
01:29:09,391 --> 01:29:10,433
Oh.

1496
01:29:12,227 --> 01:29:15,647
It was so good to see you, Ro.
I can't wait to do this again next year.

1497
01:29:15,730 --> 01:29:18,400
What are you guys doing for New Year's?
Or President's Day?

1498
01:29:18,483 --> 01:29:20,360
And don't you have
a birthday coming up, Dad?

1499
01:29:20,443 --> 01:29:23,780
- Gabby pie, come here. I love you.
- Love you too, Dad.

1500
01:29:23,863 --> 01:29:25,073
I love you, Sprout.

1501
01:29:27,909 --> 01:29:29,244
See you soon.

1502
01:29:31,913 --> 01:29:33,331
- All right.
- Wow!

1503
01:29:33,415 --> 01:29:35,000
Later, Louie.

1504
01:29:36,292 --> 01:29:37,419
Nice.

1505
01:29:37,919 --> 01:29:39,921
- Well, we better get going.
- Okay.

1506
01:29:40,005 --> 01:29:41,715
- Bye, you guys. Love you.
- Bye!

1507
01:29:41,798 --> 01:29:42,838
- Bye, Diane.
- Bye, Louie.

1508
01:29:42,882 --> 01:29:44,884
- Louie, seat belt!
- Thanks for the kale cookies!

1509
01:29:44,968 --> 01:29:46,636
I'll send you the recipe.
Thanks, Lina.

1510
01:29:46,720 --> 01:29:48,138
You're welcome. See you, Mike!

1511
01:29:48,221 --> 01:29:49,472
Bye! Thank you so much!

1512
01:29:49,556 --> 01:29:50,807
- Bye!
- Bye, girls!

1513
01:29:53,059 --> 01:29:54,144
Hey, who wants breakfast?

1514
01:29:54,227 --> 01:29:55,228
- Ooh! Me.
- I do! Yes!

1515
01:29:55,311 --> 01:29:56,980
- Chocolate chip pancakes?
- Yes!

1516
01:29:57,063 --> 01:29:58,231
Yeah.

1517
01:30:02,152 --> 01:30:03,987
- I'll be right there.
- Okay, honey.

1518
01:30:10,910 --> 01:30:12,412
Where the heck have you been?

1519
01:30:12,495 --> 01:30:13,580
Oh, no.

1520
01:30:13,663 --> 01:30:15,665
Uh-uh, uh-uh. Give me a break, kid.

1521
01:30:15,749 --> 01:30:19,419
It has been a really, really long day.

1522
01:30:19,502 --> 01:30:20,587
Tell me about it.

1523
01:30:20,670 --> 01:30:23,298
Mmm. So, did you get through your list?

1524
01:30:23,381 --> 01:30:24,924
How'd you know about my list?

1525
01:30:25,008 --> 01:30:26,968
I've been known to keep a few of my own.

1526
01:30:27,052 --> 01:30:28,928
Nothing fancy like yours, though.

1527
01:30:33,975 --> 01:30:37,228
Uh…what's this supposed to be?

1528
01:30:37,312 --> 01:30:38,521
The naughty list?

1529
01:30:38,605 --> 01:30:42,359
Nah, I prefer to think of it
more like a second chance list.

1530
01:30:42,442 --> 01:30:46,196
Deep down even the naughtiest kids
want to be nice.

1531
01:30:46,279 --> 01:30:48,948
Some just need a little more time.

1532
01:30:50,116 --> 01:30:52,702
Okay. So, how did I do?

1533
01:30:53,620 --> 01:30:54,746
Ro?

1534
01:30:55,747 --> 01:30:56,831
I better go.

1535
01:30:57,499 --> 01:30:58,625
Thanks, Santa.

1536
01:31:13,765 --> 01:31:15,558
Ho, ho, ho!

1537
01:31:16,518 --> 01:31:17,727
Santa?

1538
01:31:50,885 --> 01:31:52,220
Bye, Santa.

1539
01:31:54,639 --> 01:31:56,558
Ho, ho, ho!
