Scott,when I pump fake go on the deep post.

2
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:13,660
Jessie,block a player.

3
00:00:13,660 --> 00:00:15,150
Mikey,slant across the middle.

4
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:15,630
Ready?

5
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:16,710
Break.

6
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:17,860
Come on,defense.

7
00:00:18,730 --> 00:00:19,410
Hey,you get jessie.

8
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:21,040
I got mikey,I got mikey.

9
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:21,950
Bryce,your man.

10
00:00:21,950 --> 00:00:22,960
Zone blitz,zone blitz.

11
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:23,770
Ready.

12
00:00:24,490 --> 00:00:26,270
Hey,watch the double team,watch the double team.

13
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:29,310
What you looking at,huh?

14
00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:30,290
Let's go,what you got,huh?

15
00:00:30,290 --> 00:00:31,530
That's good,good.

16
00:00:32,190 --> 00:00:33,290
Down.

17
00:00:33,550 --> 00:00:34,680
Shut 'em down.

18
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:36,770
Come on,bryce.

19
00:00:36,770 --> 00:00:37,270
Let's go.

20
00:00:37,270 --> 00:00:38,090
Set?

21
00:00:38,090 --> 00:00:39,230
Watch it,bryce.

22
00:00:40,060 --> 00:00:41,670
he's going deep,he's going deep!

23
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:12,380
I think you killed someone,bryce!

24
00:01:18,660 --> 00:01:19,440
Let's get out of here.

25
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:20,650
Let's cut through the park!

26
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:58,490
couple of power walkers spotted the vic.

27
00:01:58,490 --> 00:02:01,700
Thought he was passed out drunk until they tried to help him up.

28
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:02,470
Any id?

29
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:03,840
No.

30
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:06,270
This guy's got some major fashion issues.

31
00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:07,930
Somebody should have told him it was winter.

32
00:02:07,930 --> 00:02:09,690
No footprints in the snow.

33
00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:11,440
He came by cart.

34
00:02:16,290 --> 00:02:18,490
shopping carts pulled by cheerleaders?

35
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:20,170
And bunnies?

36
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:25,210
I guess our vic's out of the race.

37
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:27,580
And he finished dead last.

42
00:03:17,748 --> 00:03:20,280
N the apartment's tied up in probate,so no one lives here.

43
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:21,790
It's been vacant for almost a year.

44
00:03:21,790 --> 00:03:22,830
Any id on our vic?

45
00:03:22,830 --> 00:03:25,140
No,trying to contact the owner of the building.

46
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:27,140
We're running license plates up and down the street.

47
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:27,900
Who found him?

48
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:33,050
Couple kids came into the three-five,said that 
a friend's football may have accidentally killed a man.

49
00:03:33,050 --> 00:03:34,550
I locked 'em up for fun.

50
00:03:34,550 --> 00:03:35,420
Okay.

51
00:03:35,420 --> 00:03:39,490
There's no sheet on this chair 
here with the rope or the couch.

52
00:03:39,490 --> 00:03:41,900
Every other piece of furniture is covered.

53
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:44,410
There's no cast off or other blood drops.

54
00:03:44,410 --> 00:03:49,260
Not to mention our vic isn't dressed like a guy 
who's looking to find a warm place to spend the night.

55
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:50,450
An odd murder scene.

56
00:03:50,450 --> 00:03:53,100
So what business did he have being in here?

57
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:55,560
I say we let the crime scene tell us.

58
00:04:31,330 --> 00:04:32,250
You smell that?

59
00:04:34,420 --> 00:04:35,310
Rosemary.

60
00:05:06,610 --> 00:05:09,700
There's evidence of a pool of blood 
someone tried to clean up.

61
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:13,650
Why clean up the blood over there 
and leave the dead body?

62
00:05:13,650 --> 00:05:16,380
Maybe they thought the blood over 
here might lead to something.

63
00:05:31,570 --> 00:05:35,260
stop shivering like a girl,adam,
it's not even that cold out.

64
00:05:35,260 --> 00:05:36,130
I'm from phoenix.

65
00:05:36,130 --> 00:05:38,270
85 degrees is considered freezing.

66
00:05:38,270 --> 00:05:39,370
Cupcake.

67
00:05:52,490 --> 00:05:53,470
wanna go shopping?

68
00:05:55,030 --> 00:05:56,560
I'll race you to the finish line.

69
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:36,830
The shopping cart tracks and the blood drops 
lead directly from here and they go 
all the way down to the body.

70
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:39,900
Sporadic footprint pattern.

71
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:41,890
Somebody got into something.

72
00:06:41,890 --> 00:06:44,210
Yeah,definitely more than two people.

73
00:06:58,710 --> 00:07:00,570
These don't come off that easily.

74
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:08,100
I believe we definitely found 
our primary crime scene.

75
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:20,380
There we go...

76
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:29,400
I've removed several pieces 
of trace from the head wound.

77
00:07:30,230 --> 00:07:33,670
My best guess,pre-analysis of course,
is that it's nail polish.

78
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:36,600
A woman hit our vic that hard in the head?

79
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:37,880
Enough to kill him?

80
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:40,300
Hell hath no fury.

81
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:43,070
Tox report back?

82
00:07:43,070 --> 00:07:46,270
Our vic consumed quite a bit of alcohol,
which in his case was a good thing,

83
00:07:46,270 --> 00:07:51,680
because he was shot with a price 
tag gun shortly before he died.

84
00:07:59,550 --> 00:08:02,500
didn't feel the pain but 
in the end he paid the price.

85
00:08:37,220 --> 00:08:38,080
excuse me.

86
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:39,250
Idiot-run?

87
00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:42,000
You know,like the iditarod dogsled races in alaska.

88
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:43,500
Idiotrun.

89
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:48,150
Uh-huh,so carla,are there any rules to this race?

90
00:08:48,150 --> 00:08:50,130
Try to get to the end in the fastest time.

91
00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:51,880
Definitely before midnight.

92
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:55,960
Two check-in points and then we all go across 
the street to halligan's and get hammered.

93
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:57,330
Get hammered,nice.

94
00:08:57,330 --> 00:08:59,250
Where do you guys get these carts?

95
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:01,030
Snatch 'em from wherever we can find them.

96
00:09:01,030 --> 00:09:02,120
How'd your team do?

97
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:03,590
It's not about winning for us.

98
00:09:03,590 --> 00:09:05,670
We just wanna see how many teams we can sabotage.

99
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:07,150
Sounds like it could get dangerous.

100
00:09:07,150 --> 00:09:07,990
Somebody could get hurt.

101
00:09:07,990 --> 00:09:09,580
Hey,it's all part of the race.

102
00:09:09,580 --> 00:09:11,730
The point is to crash the carts.

103
00:09:11,730 --> 00:09:15,180
Nice patch of ice will take out a team,no problem.

104
00:09:16,310 --> 00:09:16,990
Yo,hey,buddy.

105
00:09:16,990 --> 00:09:17,590
What are you doing?

106
00:09:17,590 --> 00:09:18,690
That's our cart.

107
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:24,540
Know the guy in the photo?

108
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:25,760
That's bruce abbott.

109
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:27,430
We found him in the park.

110
00:09:27,430 --> 00:09:30,040
Um,you have an idea what might 
have happened to him?

111
00:09:30,610 --> 00:09:31,620
No.

112
00:09:31,910 --> 00:09:35,380
I mean we finished the race 
hours ago,we got knocked out.

113
00:09:41,270 --> 00:09:42,190
go on.

114
00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:45,250
Hurry up,here they come.

115
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:46,270
Hurry up.

116
00:09:46,270 --> 00:09:47,720
Look out!

117
00:09:48,730 --> 00:09:49,990
Hold on!

118
00:09:51,780 --> 00:09:53,060
watch out,watch out!

119
00:10:00,260 --> 00:10:01,920
The rest of us were cold and tired.

120
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:04,600
Bruce wanted to sabotage the 
other teams' racing route.

121
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:06,510
So you left him there?

122
00:10:06,510 --> 00:10:10,140
We kept expecting him to show up 
at the bar,but he never did.

123
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:45,820
Gross examination of stomach contents reveals your vic 
ate fresh strawberries shortly before he was killed.

124
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:47,710
Fresh strawberries in the dead of winter?

125
00:10:47,710 --> 00:10:49,250
No pun intended.

126
00:10:49,250 --> 00:10:52,570
Maybe he had lunch at a high-end 
restaurant or a five star hotel?

127
00:10:52,570 --> 00:10:53,020
No.

128
00:10:53,020 --> 00:10:57,150
Condition of gastric contents suggests 
he ate them in the room he died in.

129
00:10:57,150 --> 00:11:00,370
He was definitely a gentleman of expensive tastes.

130
00:11:00,370 --> 00:11:01,580
Fingernails.

131
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:07,540
Well manicured.

132
00:11:08,150 --> 00:11:11,560
Angle of the filing indicates 
he has them done professionally.

133
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:14,660
Semicircle of white nail,quarter-inch 
beyond the fingertip.

134
00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:17,120
High gloss enamel applied to each nail.

135
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:18,470
Nice skin,too.

136
00:11:18,470 --> 00:11:20,220
Quite a tan for this time of year.

137
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:22,130
And that's no $10 haircut.

138
00:11:22,130 --> 00:11:25,670
All nicely packaged in a $3,000 suit.

139
00:11:25,670 --> 00:11:26,980
Deep pockets.

140
00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:32,270
At the crime scene we found a chair,
some duct tape,rope,evidence of a struggle.

141
00:11:32,270 --> 00:11:33,910
Are we looking at a kidnapping?

142
00:11:33,910 --> 00:11:35,420
His family is wealthy.

143
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:39,400
Could have aed for quite a ransom,
then when it wasn't paid...

144
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:41,670
they followed through on their threat?

145
00:11:41,670 --> 00:11:43,210
One would think.

146
00:11:43,210 --> 00:11:44,420
But you have another theory?

147
00:11:44,420 --> 00:11:49,070
I didn't find any traces of adhesive 
residue around his wrists,ankles or mouth.

148
00:11:49,070 --> 00:11:51,840
Our victim wasn't the one who 
was bound in that room.

149
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:56,360
So we're possibly looking at 
new york city's best dressed kidnapper.

150
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:58,590
And our kidnap victim is missing.

151
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:05,270
Okay,I've analyzed most of the trace 
that you guys collected from the scene.

152
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:09,270
On the duct tape here,I found some very small,

153
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:13,930
fine brunette hairs that were a match 
to the hairs I found on the victim's suit.

154
00:12:13,930 --> 00:12:15,350
And...

155
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:19,690
with a little un-do adhesive remover and tweezers,

156
00:12:19,690 --> 00:12:22,920
I think I got us a little bit closer 
to the identity of the kidnap victim.

157
00:12:23,830 --> 00:12:25,010
Lipstick.

158
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:26,710
Female.

159
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:30,200
She was bound and held hostage in that brownstone.

160
00:12:31,570 --> 00:12:32,660
But where is she now?

161
00:12:32,660 --> 00:12:34,430
Could there be another kidnapper?

162
00:12:34,430 --> 00:12:40,950
The partial dna results from the blood you found on the 
floor says it's from a male but it's not a match to the vic.

163
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:43,240
There was someone else in that room.

164
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:46,520
And he could still be holding a woman hostage.

165
00:12:59,450 --> 00:13:04,950
no one's reported a kidnapping to the police,and there's 
no recent missing persons report for a brunette female.

166
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:08,240
She probably lives alone and nobody noticed that she's gone.

167
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:09,880
But what about a ransom demand?

168
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:12,740
If the victim was kidnapped,that would be a possible motive.

169
00:13:12,740 --> 00:13:13,870
Unless they're dead.

170
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:18,110
Okay,so the door of the brownstone was kicked in.

171
00:13:18,110 --> 00:13:23,970
There was no report of burglary,
property damage or nypd executing a warrant.

172
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:29,690
So,I analyzed the water content of the putty 
and the wood glue used to repair the door

173
00:13:29,690 --> 00:13:32,820
and I estimate it was fixed about a month ago.

174
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:35,160
So it has nothing to do with 
our vic or the kidnapping?

175
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:35,630
Right.

176
00:13:35,630 --> 00:13:41,660
Also,I got back a full dna profile 
of the blood swabbed from the floor boards.

177
00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:43,740
There's obvious degradation.

178
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:45,050
The blood is old.

179
00:13:45,050 --> 00:13:48,180
Yeah,deposited right around 
the time the door was kicked in.

180
00:13:48,180 --> 00:13:54,520
You're suggesting there was a crime committed,a possible 
home invasion,in the same brownstone a month ago?

181
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:55,500
Right.

182
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:58,350
You're also eliminating 
the theory of a second kidnapper

183
00:13:58,350 --> 00:14:02,750
because we have no evidence that anyone else was 
in that room at the time of our vic's murder.

184
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:06,970
Well,we're still asking the same question,where is 
the woman who was bound and tied in the duct tape?

185
00:14:06,970 --> 00:14:07,670
Whoa,hold on.

186
00:14:07,670 --> 00:14:10,620
This is where it gets a little more complicated,okay?

187
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:16,630
I ran the old blood through codis and it spit out 
the name of the bleeder in the previous crime.

188
00:14:16,630 --> 00:14:18,820
Ex-con named artemis hunt.

189
00:14:18,820 --> 00:14:23,220
Now,I did some checking and 
he missed a parole meeting yesterday.

190
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:25,550
I think we need to pay mr.Hunt a visit.

191
00:14:30,110 --> 00:14:30,730
There you go.

192
00:14:30,730 --> 00:14:31,650
Thank you.

193
00:14:31,650 --> 00:14:32,510
All right.

194
00:14:32,510 --> 00:14:33,550
Take it easy.

195
00:14:33,550 --> 00:14:34,860
Artemis?

196
00:14:35,220 --> 00:14:36,850
Sorry to ruin your breakfast,pal.

197
00:14:38,740 --> 00:14:40,880
You missed your last meeting 
with your parole officer.

198
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:41,920
It was one meeting.

199
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:44,090
Where were you?

200
00:14:44,090 --> 00:14:45,440
Atlantic city.

201
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:46,840
Honest.

202
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:49,430
You bust through any doors in the past month or so?

203
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:51,000
Perhaps around east 86th street?

204
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,420
Why you two sweatin' me,huh?

205
00:14:52,420 --> 00:14:53,970
Trying to make your monthly arrest quota?

206
00:14:53,970 --> 00:14:54,370
Yeah that's it.

207
00:14:54,370 --> 00:14:56,450
Come on,it's too cold for you out here...

208
00:14:56,450 --> 00:14:57,970
Take it easy,angry man.

209
00:14:57,970 --> 00:15:02,350
My P.O.Got me a job doing fix-it work 
for a property management company,all right?

210
00:15:02,350 --> 00:15:05,230
They've got me going all kinds of 
places fixing all kinds of things.

211
00:15:05,230 --> 00:15:08,170
I fixed a busted door chain about a month ago.

212
00:15:08,170 --> 00:15:10,320
Mixing putty,stabbed my finger with the blade.

213
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:12,270
East 86th street sounds about right.

214
00:15:12,270 --> 00:15:14,220
I don't know the exact address.

215
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:17,820
You have any proof that you were 
in atlantic city yesterday?

216
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:20,250
Yeah,a girl named precious.

217
00:15:20,250 --> 00:15:20,830
She's listed.

218
00:15:20,830 --> 00:15:21,690
She'll tell you.

219
00:15:21,690 --> 00:15:25,430
How we were gambling,lost all my money 
but I did get a free voucher for the buffet.

220
00:15:25,430 --> 00:15:27,620
It was the only table I won at actually.

221
00:15:27,620 --> 00:15:28,310
Let's go.

222
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:31,150
Hey,man,what's this all about?

223
00:15:31,150 --> 00:15:33,010
Parole violation and I don't like you.

224
00:15:38,170 --> 00:15:42,400
Many of the footprints at the primary crime scene 
were on top of each other,possibly indicating a struggle.

225
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:44,660
I matched several to bruce abbott's army boot.

226
00:15:44,660 --> 00:15:46,300
The others are unknown.

227
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:48,380
Hold up,check this out right here.

228
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:49,200
Yeah?

229
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:52,100
And then right there,and then right there again.

230
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:53,950
There's only a right foot.

231
00:15:53,950 --> 00:15:55,820
Yeah,there's no compatible left foot impression.

232
00:15:55,820 --> 00:15:58,080
So we're looking at a one-legged suspect?

233
00:15:58,080 --> 00:16:00,260
I always say if it's odd,run with it.

234
00:16:00,260 --> 00:16:03,100
Gentlemen,I have determined the murder weapon.

235
00:16:04,150 --> 00:16:04,930
All right.

236
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:10,620
This is the subdermal bruising 
of bruce abbott's head wound.

237
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:13,490
This would be the tops of toes.

238
00:16:13,490 --> 00:16:16,320
Which suggests that our murder weapon is a foot.

239
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:17,870
Right foot of a woman?

240
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:19,680
Right...

241
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:21,360
is correct.

242
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:25,120
And female would explain the traces 
of red nail polish I found in the wound.

243
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:31,870
So our murderer is a one-legged,barefoot 
woman who's got serious kung-fu skills.

244
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:35,900
Could be the woman who lost this heel,right?

245
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:37,710
One shoe on,one shoe off.

246
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:39,810
It's not going to leave a pair of prints.

247
00:16:39,810 --> 00:16:41,160
Patent-leather.

248
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:43,740
There was a team of women racers at the finish line.

249
00:16:43,740 --> 00:16:44,920
Dominatrix.

250
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:49,620
I interviewed one of the girls,and her 
shoes did not match the rest of her outfit.

251
00:16:50,610 --> 00:16:53,390
And you said that there was one 
female on bruce abbott's team,right?

252
00:16:53,390 --> 00:16:54,420
That was rita.

253
00:16:54,420 --> 00:16:55,580
She drove the cart.

254
00:16:55,580 --> 00:16:57,750
One foot on the cart,one foot pushing off.

255
00:16:59,020 --> 00:17:00,220
Rita was the driver.

256
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:01,490
Bruce was the dog.

257
00:17:01,490 --> 00:17:03,900
Maybe she kicked that dog while he was down.

258
00:17:06,550 --> 00:17:08,180
Look,we lost because we crashed.

259
00:17:08,180 --> 00:17:09,670
That wasn't bruce's fault.

260
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:12,540
Some people take this race pretty seriously,huh?

261
00:17:12,540 --> 00:17:15,220
I understand every team you were on before this has won.

262
00:17:15,220 --> 00:17:16,910
This is your first loss.

263
00:17:17,620 --> 00:17:19,600
It's a goofy,childish race.

264
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:20,720
I do it for fun.

265
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:23,390
First prize is what,$3,000 bucks?

266
00:17:23,390 --> 00:17:25,910
You get your mug on a couple sport magazine covers.

267
00:17:25,910 --> 00:17:27,780
That's some pretty heady stuff,no?

268
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:29,500
I didn't kill bruce.

269
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:33,820
Maybe you just,uh,kicked him out of 
frustration,you had no idea you killed him.

270
00:17:35,850 --> 00:17:38,140
Stand up and I'll need you to put your foot in here.

271
00:17:42,690 --> 00:17:43,760
So,what's going to happen now?

272
00:17:44,330 --> 00:17:45,520
Do I need a lawyer?

273
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:47,420
That depends on your story.

274
00:17:47,980 --> 00:17:48,820
It's simple.

275
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:50,320
We lost the race.

276
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:52,900
I broke the heel of my shoe,sprained my ankle,

277
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:56,300
and I won't be able to get into a pair 
of spike boots for another six months,

278
00:17:56,300 --> 00:18:00,120
but that's the risk you take when wearing 
high heels in a race on ice.

279
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:01,990
Well,you didn't actually just lose the race,carla.

280
00:18:01,990 --> 00:18:04,120
I mean,you were sabotaged by bruce.

281
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:05,670
Hey,I give him points for being clever.

282
00:18:08,670 --> 00:18:10,300
Come on ladies,pick it up.

283
00:18:12,050 --> 00:18:13,850
There are several grates along the path.

284
00:18:13,850 --> 00:18:16,170
This bruce guy decided to cover one up.

285
00:18:24,190 --> 00:18:26,190
And you're sure you and this guy didn't get into it?

286
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:28,030
He had it coming,no?

287
00:18:28,030 --> 00:18:29,440
Most guys have it coming...

288
00:18:30,350 --> 00:18:31,450
but not for that.

289
00:18:31,450 --> 00:18:33,620
I write term life insurance policies,okay?

290
00:18:33,620 --> 00:18:34,760
It's boring.

291
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:37,310
The idiotrun and polar bear 
swim are what turn me on.

292
00:18:37,310 --> 00:18:39,100
I'm not into violence.

293
00:18:39,630 --> 00:18:41,640
You were dressed as a dominatrix.

294
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:44,740
And that's not violent,it's fun.

295
00:18:45,830 --> 00:18:48,560
Why don't you make an appointment and I'll show you.

296
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:49,970
I'm not into...

297
00:18:50,670 --> 00:18:51,660
fun.

298
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:54,410
But thank you.

299
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:02,640
Casino in atlantic city has artemis hunt on tape.

300
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:04,470
Dead end for me.

301
00:19:04,470 --> 00:19:06,560
Remember the smell of rosemary?

302
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:09,500
Air sample from the scene says benzoin resin.

303
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:12,680
Used primarily in perfumes,liniments and medicines.

304
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:15,390
Also,sid sent over the tox report.

305
00:19:15,390 --> 00:19:19,260
Turns out our guy had champagne 
to go along with his strawberries.

306
00:19:19,260 --> 00:19:20,910
Kinky kidnapper,huh?

307
00:19:20,910 --> 00:19:23,150
And maybe while he's getting intoxicated,

308
00:19:23,150 --> 00:19:28,350
our brunette keeps her head,figures out how to 
escape,kills him,gets away and ever looks back.

309
00:19:28,350 --> 00:19:30,210
Why wouldn't she call the police,report it?

310
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:31,480
Or at least go to the hospital?

311
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:32,570
She killed a man.

312
00:19:32,570 --> 00:19:34,060
Maybe she doesn't know what to do.

313
00:19:34,060 --> 00:19:37,440
If she comes from a wealthy family,
maybe they're trying to keep it low profile.

314
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:38,190
Detective?

315
00:19:38,190 --> 00:19:43,010
If a ransom was requested,
they certainly didn't involve the police.

316
00:19:43,010 --> 00:19:44,500
The results of the canvas.

317
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:48,360
License plate from a car parked 
outside the brownstone led to a rental car agency.

318
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:49,780
The car was never returned.

319
00:19:49,780 --> 00:19:51,740
The credit card led to an alex martin.

320
00:19:51,740 --> 00:19:52,710
Okay,I'll process the car.

321
00:19:52,710 --> 00:19:54,010
You track down alex.

322
00:19:56,820 --> 00:20:00,840
I've been alex martin's secretary here 
at lenway properties for the past three years.

323
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:02,330
I can't believe he's dead.

324
00:20:02,330 --> 00:20:04,410
When was the last time you saw him?

325
00:20:04,410 --> 00:20:05,920
Two days ago.

326
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:08,650
He was on his way to show a co-op in the village.

327
00:20:08,650 --> 00:20:13,120
You have a property in probate on 86th street?

328
00:20:14,740 --> 00:20:15,980
The miller property.

329
00:20:15,980 --> 00:20:18,110
Once probate was final,he had the listing.

330
00:20:18,110 --> 00:20:19,780
And the key to get in.

331
00:20:21,740 --> 00:20:24,640
Could you pull up his calendar 
for the last day you saw him?

332
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:33,290
Trainer at 7:00.

333
00:20:33,290 --> 00:20:35,530
Breakfast at 8:30.

334
00:20:35,530 --> 00:20:37,020
Two showings.

335
00:20:37,020 --> 00:20:38,970
Lunch at tavern on the green.

336
00:20:38,970 --> 00:20:41,550
What was he doing during these four hours?

337
00:20:41,550 --> 00:20:42,890
I don't know.

338
00:20:42,890 --> 00:20:46,930
Once a month he tells me to block 
out four or five hours like that.

339
00:20:46,930 --> 00:20:47,980
I never ask.

340
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:50,970
I figured he's seeing a shrink or something.

341
00:20:50,970 --> 00:20:52,440
Did he need a shrink?

342
00:20:53,270 --> 00:20:54,800
Do I have to answer that?

343
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:58,010
I mean,I really don't like talking 
badly about dead people.

344
00:21:08,740 --> 00:21:10,480
Alex martin was a real estate agent.

345
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:13,780
He made a lot of money selling brownstones,
including the one we found him in.

346
00:21:13,780 --> 00:21:15,780
Real estate agent turned kidnapper?

347
00:21:15,780 --> 00:21:17,090
The market must be really bad.

348
00:21:17,090 --> 00:21:21,050
There's evidence that our brunette hostage 
was shoved in the back of this trunk.

349
00:21:21,650 --> 00:21:22,850
Along with a horse.

350
00:21:22,850 --> 00:21:24,600
It's a small car,adam.

351
00:21:25,610 --> 00:21:26,890
Traces of a horse.

352
00:21:26,890 --> 00:21:27,810
Check this out.

353
00:21:27,810 --> 00:21:28,800
Look.

354
00:21:30,220 --> 00:21:34,560
We found wood shavings in the trunk of 
the car that were canadian yellow pine.

355
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:36,110
There's also traces of manure.

356
00:21:36,110 --> 00:21:41,370
We processed that and found two drugs: 
An ex-stress and a san-colic medicine.

357
00:21:41,370 --> 00:21:43,800
Well,the canadian pine chips 
would be used for bedding.

358
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:44,330
Right.

359
00:21:44,330 --> 00:21:46,990
How many miles did he drive 
after he rented the car?

360
00:21:46,990 --> 00:21:48,070
Four.

361
00:21:48,370 --> 00:21:49,320
Let's pull up a map.

362
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:53,030
We're looking for horses within a four 
mile radius of the rental car location.

363
00:21:58,020 --> 00:21:59,520
Stables in central park.

364
00:22:02,740 --> 00:22:03,920
that would be harley.

365
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:06,120
Only horse using both those medications.

366
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:08,100
Beautiful mustang.

367
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:09,920
Freaks out at loud noises.

368
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:11,070
Who owns harley?

369
00:22:11,070 --> 00:22:12,520
Elizabeth grayson.

370
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:14,020
Lives on park avenue.

371
00:22:14,020 --> 00:22:16,620
Has a sugar daddy named daddy.

372
00:22:16,620 --> 00:22:18,410
Nice life if you can get it.

373
00:22:18,410 --> 00:22:19,930
I'll put an alarm out on her.

374
00:22:21,150 --> 00:22:22,170
this is harley.

375
00:22:22,470 --> 00:22:23,620
Born in the wild.

376
00:22:24,550 --> 00:22:26,050
What's this all about anyway?

377
00:22:26,050 --> 00:22:28,380
We think liz grayson might be missing.

378
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:36,820
Who takes the horses out to 
the paddock on their lead line?

379
00:22:36,820 --> 00:22:37,660
I do.

380
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,340
Who rubs their legs down after a ride?

381
00:22:45,340 --> 00:22:46,640
Me.

382
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:49,070
When you said,"nice life if you can get it"......

383
00:22:51,050 --> 00:22:53,530
how far would you really go to get it,hector?

384
00:22:53,530 --> 00:22:54,530
Hold on.

385
00:22:55,070 --> 00:22:56,900
You think I know where she is?

386
00:22:56,900 --> 00:23:01,200
There was evidence of wood shavings and 
traces of harley's medicine in the trunk of a car.

387
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:03,430
And we're fairly certain the horse didn't do it.

388
00:23:03,430 --> 00:23:05,100
You know a man named alex martin?

389
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:06,070
No.

390
00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:09,900
My job is to take care 
of the horses,not their owners.

391
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:12,370
And there's harley,safe and sound.

392
00:23:12,370 --> 00:23:15,750
The question is where is liz grayson?

393
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:28,050
Thought you processed the cart already.

394
00:23:28,050 --> 00:23:29,010
I did.

395
00:23:29,010 --> 00:23:31,870
But I figured I'd take another 
look 'cause it is all we got.

396
00:23:31,870 --> 00:23:33,720
Rita and carla didn't do it.

397
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:36,540
Their foot impressions do not match 
the bruising on our vic's face.

398
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:40,130
So i'm just hoping that I can 
pull something off of this basket.

399
00:23:40,130 --> 00:23:48,690
The prints belong to bruce's and his teammates,the rest 
is ketchup,rust,plastic and some unidentified animal hair.

400
00:23:48,690 --> 00:23:49,770
Odd wheel out.

401
00:23:49,770 --> 00:23:53,100
Three originals,one old rusty wheel.

402
00:23:54,060 --> 00:23:57,940
Frankenstein job,screws and bolts,but it's sturdY.

403
00:23:57,940 --> 00:24:00,390
Except for that clean slice right there in the frame.

404
00:24:00,390 --> 00:24:03,420
I'm assuming it was sabotage by one of the other teams.

405
00:24:04,620 --> 00:24:06,560
But everything else looks like repair.

406
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:07,630
Right.

407
00:24:07,630 --> 00:24:08,780
What are you thinking?

408
00:24:09,420 --> 00:24:13,430
What market takes the time to repair a shopping cart?

409
00:24:13,430 --> 00:24:16,450
Whoever did this wanted this thing to last.

410
00:24:16,450 --> 00:24:17,170
Carla said that they...

411
00:24:17,170 --> 00:24:18,850
snatch them from wherever we can find them.

412
00:24:18,850 --> 00:24:21,880
I guess that includes someone who has one.

413
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:24,200
That someone might want it back.

414
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:28,250
I did notice a homeless guy at the 
finish line who was trying to steal a cart.

415
00:24:28,250 --> 00:24:30,140
Okay,well,maybe that's what happened with bruce.

416
00:24:30,140 --> 00:24:32,300
Someone tried to take it and they got into something.

417
00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:33,100
Yeah,it's possible.

418
00:24:34,490 --> 00:24:35,200
No,no,no.

419
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:37,860
We found bruce's body with the cart.

420
00:24:37,860 --> 00:24:40,260
If somebody wanted the cart back,
why didn't they just take it?

421
00:24:40,260 --> 00:24:42,380
Besides,we're looking for a woman.

422
00:24:42,380 --> 00:24:46,310
So unless this homeless guy's got tiny feet 
and paints his toenails,we got nothing.

423
00:24:46,310 --> 00:24:48,670
Well,we know somebody kicked bruce abbot in the head.

424
00:24:48,670 --> 00:24:52,870
And we know that he didn't push himself 
through the park and down that hill.

425
00:24:52,870 --> 00:24:57,980
Okay,so there's got to be a connection 
to our murderer somewhere on this basket.

426
00:24:58,830 --> 00:24:59,760
Let's find it.

427
00:25:34,054 --> 00:25:36,108
Match to POLYURETHANE

428
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:41,900
Liz's mother gave us the picture and your name.

429
00:25:41,900 --> 00:25:43,920
Her parents haven't heard from her in two days.

430
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:45,920
We were hoping you could help us.

431
00:25:46,820 --> 00:25:47,910
We're divorced.

432
00:25:47,910 --> 00:25:49,400
Irreconcilable differences.

433
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:50,480
I don't see liz much.

434
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:52,690
Well,when was the last time 
you did see or speak to her?

435
00:25:52,690 --> 00:25:53,850
Last month.

436
00:25:53,850 --> 00:25:55,870
I invited her to the 
christening of my new sailboat.

437
00:25:55,870 --> 00:25:59,030
I got the impression talking 
to liz's parents that if liz was kidnapped,

438
00:25:59,030 --> 00:26:02,100
they'd want to handle things on their own,
not deal with the police.

439
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:03,540
I know that they would.

440
00:26:03,540 --> 00:26:06,060
And no offense,but that's 
exactly what I would do.

441
00:26:06,060 --> 00:26:09,410
I also understand that there 
was no prenuptial agreement.

442
00:26:09,410 --> 00:26:11,320
You stop right there,detective.

443
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:12,810
I love liz.

444
00:26:12,810 --> 00:26:14,750
I don't care what I had to give 
her in the divorce.

445
00:26:14,750 --> 00:26:16,170
She could have taken it all.

446
00:26:16,170 --> 00:26:18,410
I would never hurt her.

447
00:26:22,420 --> 00:26:25,620
There was foreign substance 
in the lipstick from the tape gag.

448
00:26:25,620 --> 00:26:28,260
Turns out to be strawberries and champagne.

449
00:26:30,690 --> 00:26:36,760
So alex martin binds his victim and 
then force-feeds her champagne and strawberries?

450
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:46,040
Maybe this wasn't a kidnapping for ransom.

451
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:49,330
Maybe liz grayson was what he wanted.

452
00:26:49,330 --> 00:26:50,080
He stalked her.

453
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:51,480
Knew where to find her.

454
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:54,160
Had access to a private place to take her.

455
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:57,420
Which might explain why we're the only 
ones who think she was kidnapped.

456
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:00,620
When is a kidnapping not a kidnapping?

457
00:27:00,620 --> 00:27:02,750
When the hostage doesn't want to be found.

458
00:27:05,130 --> 00:27:05,770
taylor?

459
00:27:05,770 --> 00:27:07,540
But she killed him.

460
00:27:07,540 --> 00:27:08,910
We don't know that.

461
00:27:10,210 --> 00:27:10,960
Right.

462
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:17,480
A woman matching liz grayson's description 
just checked in to sacred cross E.R.

463
00:27:37,290 --> 00:27:39,110
I was getting ready to ride harley.

464
00:27:40,970 --> 00:27:42,540
Then he came up behind me.

465
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:54,740
I screamed.

466
00:27:56,780 --> 00:27:58,560
I tried to fight back,I just...

467
00:28:01,510 --> 00:28:03,090
I guess no one heard me.

468
00:28:11,430 --> 00:28:13,530
Liz,I'm going to have to take 
a few more pictures,okay?

469
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:16,500
Will you hold your hands out,please?

470
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:23,170
turn them around.

471
00:28:27,060 --> 00:28:28,530
I kicked and punched...

472
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:31,660
tried to pull his hair,he was just bigger...

473
00:28:32,390 --> 00:28:33,470
stronger.

474
00:28:33,650 --> 00:28:35,550
I felt like I was in that trunk for hours.

475
00:28:36,220 --> 00:28:37,470
Why don't you lay back?

476
00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:44,410
Now if at any point you want us 
to stop,you just let me know.

477
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:45,790
I'm fine.

478
00:28:51,030 --> 00:28:55,090
He opened the trunk and I screamed,but...

479
00:28:56,090 --> 00:28:57,210
he had a knife.

480
00:28:59,540 --> 00:29:02,780
He told me he'd kill me if I made any more noise.

481
00:29:05,260 --> 00:29:06,720
I was scared,so...

482
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:10,050
I just did what I was told.

483
00:29:27,490 --> 00:29:28,550
did he say what he wanted?

484
00:29:29,030 --> 00:29:29,880
Money.

485
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:33,990
Did you hear him make a call demanding ransom?

486
00:29:34,670 --> 00:29:35,350
No.

487
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:38,730
He ate strawberries and drank champagne.

488
00:29:38,730 --> 00:29:39,970
Do you remember that?

489
00:29:40,610 --> 00:29:42,890
I remember he was drunk.

490
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:45,390
I could...

491
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:48,840
smell it on his breath...

492
00:29:50,820 --> 00:30:00,260
when he untied me from the chair 
and dragged me over to the couch.

493
00:30:04,390 --> 00:30:05,710
To,uh...

494
00:30:07,210 --> 00:30:08,100
you know.

495
00:30:11,340 --> 00:30:12,850
I tried to fight him off.

496
00:30:17,180 --> 00:30:18,640
I thought he was going to kill me.

497
00:30:20,070 --> 00:30:21,420
How'd you get away?

498
00:30:43,020 --> 00:30:44,720
I didn't know he was dead.

499
00:30:46,420 --> 00:30:47,690
I just ran.

500
00:30:49,490 --> 00:30:51,710
I just got out of there and ran.

501
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:53,530
What'd you do with the knife?

502
00:30:55,050 --> 00:30:56,960
I think I threw it in a trash can.

503
00:30:57,310 --> 00:30:58,860
I just didn't want to have it.

504
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:02,100
I didn't want him to find it.

505
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:05,890
I walked for a while.

506
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:10,450
I remember washing my hands in the snow.

507
00:31:15,610 --> 00:31:16,620
What did she tell you?

508
00:31:16,990 --> 00:31:18,120
Quite a bit.

509
00:31:21,010 --> 00:31:21,840
What are you thinking?

510
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:26,390
She's lying.

511
00:31:33,550 --> 00:31:35,290
Let's just go over the facts we do know.

512
00:31:35,290 --> 00:31:41,900
The brunette hair that we found on the body of alex martin 
and pulled from the duct tape are a match to liz grayson.

513
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:51,360
Epithelials from the lipstick and the tape around 
her wrists match her reference sample and the 
evidence of her dna in the trunk of the car.

514
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:53,570
There are too many unanswered details.

515
00:31:53,570 --> 00:31:54,920
She said she tried to fight him off.

516
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:57,130
Sid never mentioned defensive wounds on our vic.

517
00:31:57,130 --> 00:31:59,680
She said her hands were still 
taped when he raped her.

518
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:01,910
How could she then grab the knife and stab him?

519
00:32:01,910 --> 00:32:05,410
The wound track is inconsistent with 
that story,and the duct tape was sliced cleanly.

520
00:32:06,420 --> 00:32:08,410
There's no way she could have done that by herself.

521
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:12,560
In the case of rape,I would expect 
to see alex martin's dna.

522
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:14,280
Two peaks at each locus.

523
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:15,720
But there are four.

524
00:32:17,100 --> 00:32:18,750
Semen from two different men?

525
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:21,730
Maybe somebody she was with before martin.

526
00:32:21,730 --> 00:32:23,840
Have a look at the peaks.

527
00:32:29,020 --> 00:32:37,390
The unknown male's sample has a higher peak,
which means that she had sex after alex martiN.

528
00:32:38,130 --> 00:32:40,670
Having sex with another man 
after you're kidnapped and raped?

529
00:32:40,670 --> 00:32:41,920
That doesn't make any sense.

530
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:43,140
Or...

531
00:32:43,140 --> 00:32:44,560
that explains everything.

532
00:32:53,590 --> 00:32:56,290
Liz grayson says she tossed 
the knife in a garbage can.

533
00:32:56,290 --> 00:32:57,650
That's all she can remember.

534
00:32:57,650 --> 00:32:59,480
Wouldn't that be nice and easy?

535
00:33:01,180 --> 00:33:02,740
I don't have that kind of luck.

536
00:33:23,150 --> 00:33:23,920
You got something?

537
00:33:24,610 --> 00:33:25,740
Yeah,I think so.

538
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:28,880
Somebody was standing here.

539
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:33,620
Direction of the heel and the toe 
indicate they were looking in this window.

540
00:33:36,170 --> 00:33:39,020
If they were here at the right time,
they had a front row seat for the show.

541
00:33:39,190 --> 00:33:42,100
And I know what time liz was 
here and the time of death.

542
00:33:42,100 --> 00:33:48,710
Add a little chemistry and meteorology and 
we could be able to determine if there was a witness.

543
00:33:57,890 --> 00:34:01,080
Plus a little dna can tell you who it was.

544
00:34:42,510 --> 00:34:44,540
Why would she wipe the knife clean?

545
00:34:49,860 --> 00:34:50,970
Oh,see this?

546
00:34:50,970 --> 00:34:51,970
White dog hair.

547
00:34:51,970 --> 00:34:52,650
Dog hair?

548
00:34:52,650 --> 00:34:56,130
Yeah,the animal hair from the cart 
is from a white mix-breed terrier.

549
00:34:56,130 --> 00:34:59,030
That should be easier to find than 
a woman with red nail polish on her toes.

550
00:34:59,030 --> 00:35:00,170
Assuming you know where to look.

551
00:35:00,170 --> 00:35:01,210
And I have a thought on that.

552
00:35:01,210 --> 00:35:02,690
Delfina's market.

553
00:35:02,690 --> 00:35:04,710
Delfina's-- that went under when I was a kid.

554
00:35:04,710 --> 00:35:06,730
Yeah,it's the name that came up 
on the handle of the cart.

555
00:35:06,730 --> 00:35:10,190
I checked out an online shopping cart 
database and found the old locations of their stores.

556
00:35:10,190 --> 00:35:13,140
One in particular stuck out 
'cause it's now an 89 cent store.

557
00:35:13,140 --> 00:35:14,760
Cool,I'll drive.

558
00:35:21,260 --> 00:35:24,460
Let me tell you,delfina's-- 
they had the best mozzarella.

559
00:35:24,460 --> 00:35:26,960
You know,I never really had the real mozzarella.

560
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:27,810
Yeah?

561
00:35:27,810 --> 00:35:28,500
Yeah.

562
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:30,160
You're coming over to my mother's on sunday.

563
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:30,950
All right.

564
00:35:30,950 --> 00:35:31,480
Yeah?

565
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:32,480
I'm taking you up on that.

566
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:33,400
All right.

567
00:35:41,540 --> 00:35:44,060
Hey,buddy.

568
00:35:46,990 --> 00:35:47,850
Hey...

569
00:35:48,010 --> 00:35:49,140
We're the good guys.

570
00:35:49,140 --> 00:35:50,250
It's okaY.

571
00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:51,620
How you doing?

572
00:35:52,910 --> 00:35:54,480
He matches the description.

573
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:56,400
Now all we need to do is find his owner.

574
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:58,630
Woman with red toenail polish.

575
00:35:59,660 --> 00:36:00,570
Where's your owner?

576
00:36:10,070 --> 00:36:11,600
I think I just found her.

577
00:36:12,140 --> 00:36:13,770
You gotta be kidding me.

578
00:36:19,540 --> 00:36:21,130
It's the right size.

579
00:36:22,010 --> 00:36:23,670
Chipped nail polish.

580
00:36:24,230 --> 00:36:26,790
Yeah,and it matches the single 
imprints in the snow.

581
00:36:29,150 --> 00:36:30,040
See all that?

582
00:36:30,340 --> 00:36:32,850
Impact damage from striking bruce on the head.

583
00:36:34,010 --> 00:36:34,860
And blood.

584
00:36:35,670 --> 00:36:36,400
Boom.

585
00:36:41,010 --> 00:36:41,490
get out of here.

586
00:36:41,490 --> 00:36:42,360
That's the guy.

587
00:36:42,450 --> 00:36:43,250
Hey.

588
00:36:43,610 --> 00:36:45,120
Hey,where you going without your dog,buddy?

589
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:45,670
That's not my dog.

590
00:36:45,690 --> 00:36:46,110
Come here.

591
00:36:46,110 --> 00:36:46,900
Isn't that your stuff back there?

592
00:36:46,900 --> 00:36:48,650
He's too loyal to let you walk away,huh?

593
00:36:48,650 --> 00:36:49,770
What business is it of yours?

594
00:36:49,770 --> 00:36:51,580
This mannequin leg was used to kill a guy.

595
00:36:51,580 --> 00:36:52,930
I don't know anything about that.

596
00:36:53,260 --> 00:36:54,620
He took your cart,didn't he?

597
00:36:54,620 --> 00:36:56,270
You wanted it back.

598
00:36:57,520 --> 00:36:58,570
You stole my cart!

599
00:36:59,550 --> 00:37:00,800
That's my cart!

600
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:01,790
Oh,hey...

601
00:37:02,510 --> 00:37:03,580
you broke it.

602
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:07,710
Whoa,okay,buddy.

603
00:37:07,710 --> 00:37:09,010
Hey,don't shoot.

604
00:37:09,550 --> 00:37:10,400
Hey!

605
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:12,460
Hey,man,come on.

606
00:37:14,120 --> 00:37:15,670
Why didn't you just leave it at that?

607
00:37:16,060 --> 00:37:16,920
They destroyed it.

608
00:37:19,330 --> 00:37:20,550
They cut it into pieces.

609
00:37:20,730 --> 00:37:21,740
It was falling apart.

610
00:37:22,790 --> 00:37:25,130
I seen that snot-nosed kid laughing at me.

611
00:37:25,130 --> 00:37:26,840
you broke my cart!

612
00:37:30,180 --> 00:37:31,060
He ruined it.

613
00:37:33,620 --> 00:37:34,910
It was all I had.

614
00:37:35,300 --> 00:37:36,540
They broke it and didn't care.

615
00:37:38,330 --> 00:37:39,480
It was all I had.

616
00:37:40,990 --> 00:37:42,850
I mean,where am I going to put my stuff?

617
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:48,330
Don't move,don't move.

618
00:37:54,370 --> 00:38:01,130
Alex martin didn't have any bites or bruises 
or scratch marks on him despite the fact 
that liz claimed she struggled with him.

619
00:38:01,130 --> 00:38:02,350
So why make it all up?

620
00:38:02,350 --> 00:38:05,150
She was romantically involved with martin.

621
00:38:05,150 --> 00:38:07,470
The rape was consensual sex.

622
00:38:07,470 --> 00:38:09,110
I've known alex for about a year.

623
00:38:09,910 --> 00:38:11,110
We'd meet once a month.

624
00:38:11,110 --> 00:38:12,430
And you played games.

625
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:14,510
Indulged our fantasies.

626
00:38:14,510 --> 00:38:15,520
It was exciting.

627
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:17,430
You could dream up any scenario.

628
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:31,860
get out of here,punk.

629
00:38:39,810 --> 00:38:41,250
Home invasion was his idea.

630
00:38:41,510 --> 00:38:46,450
Alex hired that goon from the property management 
company to break in so alex could protect us.

631
00:38:46,450 --> 00:38:47,730
Save me.

632
00:38:47,730 --> 00:38:49,500
That was his fantasy.

633
00:38:49,500 --> 00:38:51,560
And yours was to be kidnapped?

634
00:38:51,560 --> 00:38:53,900
L wanted to be vulnerable,taken by surprise.

635
00:38:53,900 --> 00:38:55,620
I like the idea of bondage.

636
00:38:59,730 --> 00:39:01,790
Two days ago,she wanted to be kidnapped.

637
00:39:01,790 --> 00:39:03,670
That wasn't enough for her?

638
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,190
Who did she have sex with 
after she was with martin?

639
00:39:06,190 --> 00:39:08,200
The guy who killed him.

640
00:39:12,330 --> 00:39:13,450
It's a common knife.

641
00:39:14,350 --> 00:39:18,310
The fibers we pulled from the murder 
weapon match the rope on your boat.

642
00:39:18,310 --> 00:39:20,300
Common knife,common rope.

643
00:39:20,300 --> 00:39:21,600
Tell me something,terry.

644
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:26,510
What were you doing outside the brownstone 
looking in at the exact time liz was there?

645
00:39:27,090 --> 00:39:28,190
you can't prove that.

646
00:39:32,180 --> 00:39:33,290
Actually,that's where you're wrong.

647
00:39:35,080 --> 00:39:39,480
Because I captured time with a little 
superglue and a snowflake.

648
00:39:40,350 --> 00:39:44,790
I found hexagonal plate snowflakes 
in the boot prints outside the window.

649
00:39:45,890 --> 00:39:49,050
The glue keeps the structure intact.

650
00:39:50,170 --> 00:39:53,630
You know what makes that type 
of snowflake special,terry?

651
00:39:54,310 --> 00:39:56,660
It could have only been formed 
at a certain temperature,

652
00:39:57,440 --> 00:40:04,190
and the temperature was recorded at the weather 
service at the exact time that we fixed time of death.

653
00:40:06,130 --> 00:40:07,210
You were there,terry.

654
00:40:08,110 --> 00:40:12,580
Your dna is going to match what we pulled 
off the cigarette butt you left outside the window

655
00:40:12,580 --> 00:40:14,520
and the semen we retrieved from liz.

656
00:40:16,650 --> 00:40:18,010
She left me for another man.

657
00:40:19,830 --> 00:40:22,090
I gave her everything and she left me.

658
00:40:26,420 --> 00:40:28,360
You gave her everything except the thrill.

659
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:57,860
Premeditated murder,terry.

660
00:40:58,550 --> 00:41:00,810
You went in there to kill alex martin.

661
00:41:01,420 --> 00:41:03,820
I wanted liz to know that I loved her.

662
00:41:09,350 --> 00:41:10,710
This is what you want?

663
00:41:11,820 --> 00:41:12,920
He's who you want?

664
00:41:29,450 --> 00:41:30,420
you have tget out of here.

665
00:41:33,930 --> 00:41:35,940
I had no idea you would kill for me.

666
00:41:45,320 --> 00:41:46,240
Go.

667
00:41:48,150 --> 00:41:51,130
A broken heart,a moment of rage,
and you killed a man.

668
00:41:51,190 --> 00:41:52,460
Was it all worth it,terry?

669
00:41:53,260 --> 00:41:54,350
Oh,yeah.

670
00:41:56,440 --> 00:41:58,260
Now I know she loves me.
