1
00:02:53,036 --> 00:02:56,823
Assuming the Ottoman Empire
finally becomes defunct,

2
00:02:56,825 --> 00:03:00,597
Russia would get the Dardanelles,
the portion closest to them,

3
00:03:00,599 --> 00:03:04,037
and the Italians,
the islands of mainland.

4
00:03:04,470 --> 00:03:09,025
- The French had no problem with that?
- The French have problems with everything.

5
00:03:09,593 --> 00:03:11,175
That's their nature.

6
00:03:11,908 --> 00:03:14,154
And the big pieces?

7
00:03:14,255 --> 00:03:18,197
Once I conceded the control over Syria
and Lebanon to them it got easier.

8
00:03:19,618 --> 00:03:21,444
Let us read your mind.

9
00:03:21,446 --> 00:03:24,913
Mr Churchill, do you really want
Lebanon for the British Empire?

10
00:03:24,915 --> 00:03:29,539
It's a mess grown in a 1,000 years
that no one will ever disentangle.

11
00:03:29,541 --> 00:03:32,320
Syria might pose a bigger problem.

12
00:03:32,322 --> 00:03:37,549
Sunni, Shiite, Alawis, Druze,
Christian, all at each other's throats.

13
00:03:37,551 --> 00:03:41,996
And up North, the Kurds.
Let the French deal with the Kurds.

14
00:03:41,998 --> 00:03:44,993
Or let the French
try to deal with the Kurds.

15
00:03:44,995 --> 00:03:46,481
And let them fail.

16
00:03:46,482 --> 00:03:49,453
I know where all our intelligence
comes from.

17
00:03:52,723 --> 00:03:56,110
Are you trying to say...
from the woman?

18
00:03:57,239 --> 00:03:59,167
From that woman?

19
00:03:59,169 --> 00:04:02,625
Petty rivalries only after cocktails.

20
00:04:05,812 --> 00:04:07,931
Now, to us.

21
00:04:07,933 --> 00:04:11,503
Zone B: our area of influence.

22
00:04:11,505 --> 00:04:14,890
I wrestle from the French
Baghdad, Basra, Kuwait.

23
00:04:14,892 --> 00:04:18,531
This will now be
under our direct control.

24
00:04:18,533 --> 00:04:21,128
And how do we delineate the borders?

25
00:04:21,130 --> 00:04:23,809
- That will fall in place later.
- Now.

26
00:04:24,363 --> 00:04:27,522
This is the moment.
It has to be now.

27
00:04:33,638 --> 00:04:36,396
Well. Our issues start down here,
in the South.

28
00:04:36,398 --> 00:04:39,068
Now it's just a vague dotted line.

29
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:42,510
- We have a problem with Ibn Saud.
- The scoundrel.

30
00:04:42,512 --> 00:04:43,791
In fact we have two problems.

31
00:04:43,793 --> 00:04:47,288
Firstly, he wants the whole of Arabia
as a separate country for himself.

32
00:04:47,290 --> 00:04:48,742
The bastard.

33
00:04:49,844 --> 00:04:53,551
And secondly,
he wants a flexible border.

34
00:04:53,553 --> 00:04:56,896
One of his tribes is moving North
for the summer pastures.

35
00:04:56,898 --> 00:05:00,275
There are no bloody pastures.
There's only sand.

36
00:05:00,277 --> 00:05:02,282
And he wants a border...

37
00:05:02,283 --> 00:05:04,850
according to the movement
of people, not territory.

38
00:05:05,358 --> 00:05:07,206
East is not fly.

39
00:05:08,171 --> 00:05:10,755
Who knows best about tribes?

40
00:05:10,757 --> 00:05:13,828
Lineages, affiliations, rivalries.

41
00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:17,023
Who knows best
about Bedouin tribes?

42
00:05:18,042 --> 00:05:20,755
And who is going
to rule over all of this?

43
00:05:21,884 --> 00:05:24,472
We are talking
to potential future kings.

44
00:05:24,474 --> 00:05:28,787
Who knows the candidates?
Who knows them best?

45
00:05:31,074 --> 00:05:33,259
The woman. Gertrude.

46
00:05:34,418 --> 00:05:36,296
Gertrude who?

47
00:05:37,129 --> 00:05:40,782
- Gertrude Bell.
- A silly bitch.

48
00:05:40,784 --> 00:05:44,781
It's a chattering windbag
of conceited, gushing,

49
00:05:44,782 --> 00:05:46,939
heavy chested man-woman,

50
00:05:47,353 --> 00:05:51,193
a globe trotting,
rump-wagging, blethering ass.

51
00:05:56,953 --> 00:05:58,498
Gertrude.

52
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:01,239
- Gertrude, look at me.
- Mother, don't.

53
00:06:01,241 --> 00:06:03,451
- What?
- Don't tell me how to behave.

54
00:06:03,453 --> 00:06:05,026
I'm afraid I'm going to, anyway.

55
00:06:06,794 --> 00:06:09,337
- You will smile.
- Yes, mother.

56
00:06:10,149 --> 00:06:13,888
You will not scare
the young men with your intelligence.

57
00:06:13,890 --> 00:06:16,707
How do I do that?
I cannot play dumb.

58
00:06:16,709 --> 00:06:19,794
Just... listen to what
they have to say and smile.

59
00:06:19,796 --> 00:06:21,621
That will be hard.

60
00:06:22,137 --> 00:06:24,190
- Gertrude...
- I love it.

61
00:06:27,279 --> 00:06:29,155
I love it.

62
00:06:29,157 --> 00:06:31,359
I love it.

63
00:06:47,350 --> 00:06:49,714
- And then?
- You mean after the lion?

64
00:06:49,716 --> 00:06:52,175
- Yes.
- Well then I shot an elephant.

65
00:06:53,138 --> 00:06:55,449
And all of this was
in the South of Sudan?

66
00:06:55,451 --> 00:06:58,263
No, my hunting party
had moved to Kenya by then. - Oh.

67
00:06:58,265 --> 00:07:00,597
God, was that a safari!

68
00:07:02,345 --> 00:07:04,734
I would guess
you didn't shoot just one elephant.

69
00:07:05,807 --> 00:07:11,305
First a rhino, then a lion,
and then two elephant bulls.

70
00:07:12,978 --> 00:07:15,160
Are there any elephants left in Africa?

71
00:07:16,717 --> 00:07:18,607
You meaning what, young lady?

72
00:07:23,812 --> 00:07:26,020
Gertrude...

73
00:07:26,022 --> 00:07:28,834
I would love to elope with you.

74
00:07:30,303 --> 00:07:33,234
Where to? Paris, India?

75
00:07:34,004 --> 00:07:35,053
The pyramids?

76
00:07:35,255 --> 00:07:38,321
Out there, there is a barn.

77
00:07:40,705 --> 00:07:42,696
You mean hay?

78
00:07:44,179 --> 00:07:47,587
Nobody would notice
if we left for a few minutes.

79
00:07:48,414 --> 00:07:51,452
You mean for fornication.
Quick and straight forward.

80
00:07:51,454 --> 00:07:52,750
Absolutely.

81
00:07:53,976 --> 00:07:56,770
- Like the cattle in the field?
- Absolutely.

82
00:07:57,714 --> 00:08:01,181
Arnold Runcie, I barely know you.

83
00:08:01,183 --> 00:08:05,099
- But you seem to like cows.
- Absolutely.

84
00:08:05,845 --> 00:08:07,541
How many do you have?

85
00:08:07,543 --> 00:08:12,189
Near Newcastle
I have 800 Herefordshire.

86
00:08:12,191 --> 00:08:16,733
Up North, in Scotland, 2,000.

87
00:08:17,651 --> 00:08:20,950
- Angus?
- Angus. Yes.

88
00:08:21,694 --> 00:08:23,397
Black Angus.

89
00:08:38,748 --> 00:08:42,484
Miss Bell, thank you for the honour.

90
00:08:43,396 --> 00:08:45,581
Over here, Mr. Havenhurst.

91
00:08:45,583 --> 00:08:47,445
Over here to your left.

92
00:08:47,447 --> 00:08:49,544
I'm so sorry.

93
00:08:50,549 --> 00:08:51,875
I'm so sorry.

94
00:08:54,456 --> 00:08:55,983
Dear God!

95
00:08:56,824 --> 00:08:59,527
Send me an earthquake, please.

96
00:09:16,406 --> 00:09:19,313
I can't take it. I can't take it any longer.

97
00:09:19,938 --> 00:09:22,289
I feel so domesticated.

98
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:26,795
- It's stifling to me.
- Gertrude, what am I supposed to say?

99
00:09:26,797 --> 00:09:30,401
I can say it. We should never
have allowed you to go to Oxford.

100
00:09:30,501 --> 00:09:32,112
But dear,
she's one of only four women

101
00:09:32,114 --> 00:09:35,174
to study history and to graduate
with the highest honours.

102
00:09:35,447 --> 00:09:38,641
A young unmarried woman
from a good family should not...

103
00:09:38,643 --> 00:09:40,933
Should not be allowed out on the streets
without a chaperon.

104
00:09:41,399 --> 00:09:45,182
- Gertrude, would you please sit down?
- No, I don't want to sit down.

105
00:09:45,691 --> 00:09:48,882
Darling, I have always supported you.

106
00:09:48,884 --> 00:09:51,581
I watched you
climb sharp, high rocks.

107
00:09:51,583 --> 00:09:55,429
Let us not forget the string of nannies
who quit because of your wilfulness.

108
00:09:55,873 --> 00:09:57,858
Well, so what.

109
00:09:58,056 --> 00:10:01,397
Do you remember that time when
you climbed that tall beech tree in the park?

110
00:10:01,399 --> 00:10:04,552
And you had a very large lamp shade
on your back.

111
00:10:05,304 --> 00:10:07,155
Yes, I remember that.

112
00:10:07,157 --> 00:10:09,846
You were only 5,
you were already reading voraciously.

113
00:10:09,848 --> 00:10:13,513
Somebody stupidly showed you
Leonardo da Vinci's sketchbook.

114
00:10:13,962 --> 00:10:17,929
- I remember the one with the parachute.
- Who ever would need a parachute?

115
00:10:18,559 --> 00:10:21,004
Everyone.
Everyone needs a parachute.

116
00:10:21,006 --> 00:10:25,061
It probably hurt me more than you
when you broke your ankle.

117
00:10:25,591 --> 00:10:28,273
I don't like to think about it,
it hurts me even today.

118
00:10:29,639 --> 00:10:31,802
Get me out of here, please.

119
00:10:32,404 --> 00:10:35,408
Please, please, get me out of here!

120
00:10:35,410 --> 00:10:38,848
India, Arabia, anywhere.
Please?

121
00:10:48,803 --> 00:10:50,194
You know...

122
00:10:52,665 --> 00:10:55,640
However how much it hurts me
when you're not around,

123
00:10:57,304 --> 00:10:59,888
we are going to have
to get you out of here.

124
00:11:00,516 --> 00:11:01,950
Where?

125
00:11:03,649 --> 00:11:05,549
What about Tehran?

126
00:11:06,408 --> 00:11:08,021
The embassy.

127
00:11:14,105 --> 00:11:16,976
I'm going to introduce Gertrude now.

128
00:11:16,978 --> 00:11:20,846
It's introduction time.
Give me your glass for a moment? Thank you.

129
00:11:21,676 --> 00:11:23,504
Excellencies.

130
00:11:23,506 --> 00:11:26,759
Here you go. Ladies and gentlemen,
come forward.

131
00:11:28,306 --> 00:11:30,351
Come forward. Thank you.

132
00:11:32,099 --> 00:11:36,412
I would like to introduce
Gertrude Lowthian Bell to you.

133
00:11:36,414 --> 00:11:39,764
She is a brilliant young scholar.

134
00:11:39,766 --> 00:11:43,479
And I am blessed
to call her my niece.

135
00:11:43,481 --> 00:11:47,361
She is actually the daughter
of my wife Mary's sister.

136
00:11:47,984 --> 00:11:50,101
And we love her.

137
00:11:50,103 --> 00:11:55,685
And I'm sure you all will make
her stay with us a wonderful experience.

138
00:11:56,784 --> 00:12:00,103
As to the return of my dear wife,

139
00:12:00,105 --> 00:12:03,286
boys, the wildlife is over.

140
00:12:05,185 --> 00:12:08,210
No more riding on horseback
into our dining room.

141
00:12:09,611 --> 00:12:13,766
No more drunken orgies
on our well-groomed British lawn.

142
00:12:15,192 --> 00:12:18,522
No more rescues
of damsels in distress.

143
00:12:19,106 --> 00:12:22,325
And no more public display

144
00:12:22,327 --> 00:12:27,406
of the wildest irreverence
towards our beloved Queen Victoria.

145
00:12:28,034 --> 00:12:31,402
Who, I think, needs to spend time here

146
00:12:31,909 --> 00:12:37,142
to lean her from her grand design
of a prudish empire.

147
00:12:39,662 --> 00:12:42,963
To the British Empire!

148
00:12:43,794 --> 00:12:45,365
And to Persia.

149
00:12:45,367 --> 00:12:50,286
The country of 5,000 years of poetry.

150
00:12:51,291 --> 00:12:52,986
Why is my glass empty?

151
00:12:52,988 --> 00:12:55,052
Where is the champagne?

152
00:13:11,963 --> 00:13:15,584
The scents... I can't believe it.

153
00:13:18,088 --> 00:13:20,890
- And the birds.
- Nightingale.

154
00:13:20,892 --> 00:13:24,919
When I cry at night into my pillow,
she always makes me feel happy.

155
00:13:24,921 --> 00:13:28,361
She? I think
it's only the males who sing.

156
00:13:28,985 --> 00:13:32,278
- Don't spoil it.
- I'm sorry, Flo...

157
00:13:33,451 --> 00:13:34,782
Hello.

158
00:13:37,414 --> 00:13:39,113
I'm Henry Cadogan.

159
00:13:39,114 --> 00:13:41,281
- I am...
- Henry is the secretary of the Embassy.

160
00:13:41,986 --> 00:13:45,398
Actually,
I'm only the third secretary.

161
00:13:46,370 --> 00:13:49,902
Ms. Bell, I welcome you to the embassy
of Her Majesty the Queen.

162
00:13:50,694 --> 00:13:52,683
Her Prudish Majesty.

163
00:13:54,698 --> 00:13:57,469
I've been officially assigned
to be your guardian

164
00:13:57,470 --> 00:13:59,127
and to entertain you, so...

165
00:13:59,790 --> 00:14:03,576
If there's anything you need at all,
please let me know.

166
00:14:04,982 --> 00:14:06,779
I will do that.

167
00:14:12,365 --> 00:14:13,805
Henry.

168
00:14:14,152 --> 00:14:16,429
Oh Henry, please show us
your trick shots.

169
00:14:16,799 --> 00:14:20,374
Florence, the table isn't even free.

170
00:14:20,580 --> 00:14:21,730
Please. Please. Please. Please?

171
00:14:24,266 --> 00:14:26,449
No, I'm not a circus performer.

172
00:14:27,590 --> 00:14:30,228
He has two unbelievable trick shots.

173
00:14:30,982 --> 00:14:34,083
Show us your "Orbit of the Moon".

174
00:14:34,085 --> 00:14:36,533
Florence, it's embarrassing.

175
00:14:36,785 --> 00:14:40,552
- What's your second trick shot?
- The "Frog Leap".

176
00:14:41,181 --> 00:14:43,852
Henry, show us your card trick.

177
00:14:43,854 --> 00:14:45,979
He has the greatest of card tricks.

178
00:14:45,981 --> 00:14:48,282
- Really?
- Please?

179
00:14:48,284 --> 00:14:51,596
Florence, it's a silly trick. No!

180
00:14:59,172 --> 00:15:00,412
Come, come.

181
00:15:07,082 --> 00:15:10,253
Ms. Bell,
may I suggest at the residency,

182
00:15:10,254 --> 00:15:12,706
you put your bed out
on the roof under the sky.

183
00:15:14,635 --> 00:15:17,157
I do love the stars at night.

184
00:15:17,410 --> 00:15:19,999
Although I'll have to put out
the mosquito netting for you.

185
00:15:20,001 --> 00:15:21,782
The mosquitoes are awful.

186
00:15:22,808 --> 00:15:25,646
Mrs. Lascelles,
are we not boring you?

187
00:15:25,647 --> 00:15:26,647
No.

188
00:15:27,307 --> 00:15:29,301
Oh, no. No, no, no, no.

189
00:15:29,303 --> 00:15:32,979
Florence. Florence,
will you please come over?

190
00:15:32,981 --> 00:15:33,985
Now?

191
00:15:33,987 --> 00:15:37,348
The new Italian ambassador
has a present for you.

192
00:15:37,469 --> 00:15:40,736
- Henry, I should come right back.
- Hurray.

193
00:15:54,215 --> 00:15:57,104
It's like "The Beast's Garden".

194
00:16:00,003 --> 00:16:05,230
It's a perfect nightmare
of flowers and scents.

195
00:16:19,103 --> 00:16:22,835
Mr. Cadogan, do you by any chance
know what this inscription says?

196
00:16:22,837 --> 00:16:23,998
Yes.

197
00:16:25,732 --> 00:16:27,598
It's in Farsi.

198
00:16:28,042 --> 00:16:30,021
But a medieval form of it.

199
00:16:31,499 --> 00:16:32,934
Can you read it? -Hmm

200
00:16:36,490 --> 00:16:41,321
"With them,
the seed of wisdom did I sow

201
00:16:42,165 --> 00:16:46,681
"and with my own hand
labour'd it to grow."

202
00:16:46,781 --> 00:16:48,719
"And this was all the harvest
that I reap'd

203
00:16:48,962 --> 00:16:50,967
"I came like water
and like wind I go."

204
00:16:53,067 --> 00:16:54,827
Miss Bell, you know poetry?

205
00:16:56,211 --> 00:16:59,256
- You know Omar Khayyam.
- Yes, I do.

206
00:17:01,970 --> 00:17:03,756
I want to learn his language.

207
00:17:08,384 --> 00:17:10,015
<i>Mother dearest,</i>

208
00:17:10,017 --> 00:17:13,076
<i>I'm using the opportunity
to send you this</i>

209
00:17:13,078 --> 00:17:14,777
<i>With today's diplomatic pouch.</i>

210
00:17:15,403 --> 00:17:18,846
<i>My first week has been most precious
and I have started to learn Farsi</i>

211
00:17:18,848 --> 00:17:21,532
<i>in order to read the poets
in their original.</i>

212
00:17:23,631 --> 00:17:27,619
<i>Mr. Cadogan, who works at the embassy,
is very helpful in this.</i>

213
00:17:28,245 --> 00:17:31,633
<i>He is agreeable,
intelligent, well-read,</i>

214
00:17:31,668 --> 00:17:34,453
<i>looking after us, Florence and me,
as his special property.</i>

215
00:17:35,208 --> 00:17:36,707
<i>I like him.</i>

216
00:17:38,425 --> 00:17:40,687
<i>He's invited us
to ride with him today."</i>

217
00:17:46,387 --> 00:17:48,978
- But Henry, you can't ride.
- Yes, I can.

218
00:17:48,980 --> 00:17:50,353
What if you fall?

219
00:17:51,077 --> 00:17:53,280
- It happens to the best.
- You will get hurt.

220
00:17:53,281 --> 00:17:54,681
I don't like you to ride.

221
00:17:55,067 --> 00:17:58,245
- Why don't you join us?
- I'm afraid of horses.

222
00:18:01,108 --> 00:18:02,224
Bye.

223
00:18:33,586 --> 00:18:39,114
Miss Bell, this is my favourite place
in all of the countryside.

224
00:18:40,035 --> 00:18:42,659
After the winter,
when the water level is very high,

225
00:18:42,661 --> 00:18:46,598
and the shepherds swim their flocks
down here for the summer pasture.

226
00:18:48,133 --> 00:18:51,059
Sometimes, a thousand of sheep.

227
00:18:51,061 --> 00:18:55,550
And the shepherds swim among them
on these inflated goat skins.

228
00:18:56,115 --> 00:18:57,986
- Yes, I've seen that.
- Have you?

229
00:18:57,988 --> 00:18:59,552
In Babylonian reliefs.

230
00:18:59,850 --> 00:19:02,053
They were doing it 4,000 years ago.

231
00:19:03,730 --> 00:19:07,081
- They still do.
- It's extraordinary.

232
00:19:09,351 --> 00:19:11,364
Sometimes I go up there.

233
00:19:14,007 --> 00:19:15,832
I'm a fairly good mountain climber,

234
00:19:15,833 --> 00:19:18,100
but how for God's sake
do you get up there?

235
00:19:18,135 --> 00:19:20,575
I must confess it's pretty easy.

236
00:19:21,931 --> 00:19:24,586
You walk around the back
and go up.

237
00:19:25,918 --> 00:19:27,754
Why?

238
00:19:28,667 --> 00:19:30,330
Why do you go there?

239
00:19:36,021 --> 00:19:37,754
I go when I'm lonely.

240
00:19:40,766 --> 00:19:42,862
I get very lonely.

241
00:19:59,234 --> 00:20:00,421
Gertrude.

242
00:20:01,645 --> 00:20:03,873
- Yes?
- A letter.

243
00:20:04,442 --> 00:20:07,002
- A letter for me?
- No, for Henry.

244
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:11,692
- You mean Mr. Cadogan?
- Yes, Henry.

245
00:20:11,694 --> 00:20:14,320
Could you please
hand him this letter?

246
00:20:14,892 --> 00:20:16,740
Why don't you give it to him yourself?

247
00:20:16,742 --> 00:20:19,214
I cannot.

248
00:20:19,216 --> 00:20:20,899
Why can't you?

249
00:20:22,410 --> 00:20:25,660
Gertrude, from woman to woman,
you won't say anything?

250
00:20:26,974 --> 00:20:29,834
- No, I won't.
- To no one?

251
00:20:30,773 --> 00:20:33,056
Not a soul. I promise.

252
00:20:35,905 --> 00:20:41,826
Ever since last year. I mean
since one year, two months and 11 days...

253
00:20:42,266 --> 00:20:43,981
What?

254
00:20:43,983 --> 00:20:46,106
I have had...

255
00:20:46,108 --> 00:20:48,308
a passion for Henry.

256
00:20:49,898 --> 00:20:52,279
What did he say to you today?
Did he mention me today?

257
00:20:55,055 --> 00:20:57,429
No, we just talked about shepherds.

258
00:20:59,113 --> 00:21:01,820
Why can't you give Mr. Cadogan
your letter?

259
00:21:01,822 --> 00:21:03,335
I just can't.

260
00:21:03,337 --> 00:21:06,972
And I sending him letters by mail
might cause gossip upon its arrival.

261
00:21:06,974 --> 00:21:08,276
Letters?

262
00:21:08,278 --> 00:21:10,723
I wrote him 202.

263
00:21:11,353 --> 00:21:14,319
It's terrible.

264
00:21:16,751 --> 00:21:18,241
I can't send them.

265
00:21:21,625 --> 00:21:24,576
Sweet Florence, my darling.

266
00:21:25,261 --> 00:21:27,491
You know I'd do anything for you.

267
00:21:28,863 --> 00:21:31,932
But I cannot
fight the battles of your heart.

268
00:21:55,039 --> 00:21:56,747
<i>Father dearest,</i>

269
00:21:57,533 --> 00:21:59,990
<i>I do not know where to begin.</i>

270
00:22:00,896 --> 00:22:03,721
<i>The Orient is like a prolonged dream.</i>

271
00:22:04,895 --> 00:22:09,217
<i>I am being taken care of wonderfully
by Auntie, and for all the rest</i>

272
00:22:09,219 --> 00:22:12,329
<i>Mr. Cadogan is a fine guide
and guardian.</i>

273
00:22:17,267 --> 00:22:20,005
<i>He takes care of Florence and me.</i>

274
00:22:20,007 --> 00:22:22,813
<i>He shows us lovely things
from the bazaars.</i>

275
00:22:23,756 --> 00:22:25,762
<i>He's always there
when we want him.</i>

276
00:22:25,764 --> 00:22:27,612
<i>And never when we don't.</i>

277
00:22:28,185 --> 00:22:29,479
Hurry.

278
00:22:40,255 --> 00:22:43,527
Yes. Thank you for bringing us.

279
00:22:45,547 --> 00:22:48,716
You see,
they really eat the heads here.

280
00:22:49,191 --> 00:22:50,261
Do they?

281
00:22:50,263 --> 00:22:52,516
- This is a delicacy?
- Yes.

282
00:22:59,131 --> 00:23:00,952
Such lovely colours!

283
00:23:01,553 --> 00:23:03,584
- Yes.
- They are so pretty.

284
00:23:03,586 --> 00:23:06,058
This is paprika. You can try it.

285
00:23:06,587 --> 00:23:07,713
Can I?

286
00:23:12,950 --> 00:23:14,228
How to say "Thank you".

287
00:23:18,131 --> 00:23:20,053
Do you love it, Florence?

288
00:23:33,049 --> 00:23:34,514
Miss Bell.

289
00:23:36,092 --> 00:23:38,587
I stayed up,
hoping I would see you.

290
00:23:39,105 --> 00:23:41,263
I didn't come to play billiards.

291
00:23:43,188 --> 00:23:44,545
Why did you come?

292
00:23:46,914 --> 00:23:49,543
I came for your card trick.

293
00:23:50,913 --> 00:23:51,931
I see.

294
00:23:54,446 --> 00:23:56,136
Card trick it is.

295
00:23:57,188 --> 00:23:59,194
You have to come over here.

296
00:24:05,146 --> 00:24:08,620
As you can see,
the deck is already shuffled.

297
00:24:09,454 --> 00:24:13,162
The red cards and the black cards
are placed at random.

298
00:24:16,049 --> 00:24:19,627
This trick is fiendish.

299
00:24:21,616 --> 00:24:27,494
From this point on,
I will not touch the cards.

300
00:24:29,264 --> 00:24:31,029
You'll do everything.

301
00:24:31,768 --> 00:24:32,919
Me?

302
00:24:35,630 --> 00:24:39,144
I'm going to cast a spell over you.

303
00:24:40,353 --> 00:24:44,274
And under this spell,
without looking,

304
00:24:44,276 --> 00:24:50,220
you'll be able to determine
if the card is red or if it is black.

305
00:24:50,809 --> 00:24:52,512
Without looking at the cards?

306
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:56,912
That's impossible.

307
00:24:56,914 --> 00:24:59,462
According to the laws of probability.

308
00:25:00,491 --> 00:25:02,950
Under my spell...

309
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:07,129
the laws do not exist.

310
00:25:10,176 --> 00:25:11,910
You may begin.

311
00:25:15,713 --> 00:25:17,676
Do not turn it over.

312
00:25:18,261 --> 00:25:19,575
I'm not.

313
00:25:20,419 --> 00:25:21,969
What colour is it?

314
00:25:26,513 --> 00:25:27,594
Black.

315
00:25:30,310 --> 00:25:31,394
Black.

316
00:25:33,758 --> 00:25:34,837
Red.

317
00:25:36,546 --> 00:25:37,628
Black.

318
00:25:38,030 --> 00:25:39,067
Red.

319
00:25:42,431 --> 00:25:44,422
Black. Black.

320
00:25:44,424 --> 00:25:47,137
Red. Red. Red.

321
00:25:59,084 --> 00:26:00,594
Voilà.

322
00:26:04,105 --> 00:26:07,989
Mr. Cadogan,
you did touch the cards again.

323
00:26:07,991 --> 00:26:09,533
When you turned them over.

324
00:26:12,910 --> 00:26:16,120
Gertrude, you're very smart.

325
00:26:17,652 --> 00:26:20,119
You're the only one
who's ever noticed that.

326
00:26:22,934 --> 00:26:25,882
Did you just call me "Gertrude", Henry?

327
00:26:27,254 --> 00:26:28,730
Yes, I did.

328
00:26:30,170 --> 00:26:32,286
And did you just call me Henry?

329
00:26:34,793 --> 00:26:36,645
The walls have ears.

330
00:26:41,311 --> 00:26:43,480
How does the trick really work?

331
00:26:48,908 --> 00:26:50,708
I'm not going to tell you.

332
00:26:51,833 --> 00:26:53,966
But you're very close.

333
00:26:55,275 --> 00:26:56,791
Am I?

334
00:27:32,051 --> 00:27:33,976
I love the birds here.

335
00:27:37,936 --> 00:27:39,842
I come here for the birds.

336
00:28:49,771 --> 00:28:52,259
This is the Tower of Silence.

337
00:29:05,317 --> 00:29:08,871
Gertrude, you're sure
you wish to climb all the way up?

338
00:29:08,873 --> 00:29:10,188
Yes, I'm sure.

339
00:29:10,190 --> 00:29:11,928
Yes.

340
00:29:14,252 --> 00:29:17,006
There may be bones.

341
00:29:17,494 --> 00:29:19,286
Maybe skulls.

342
00:29:19,950 --> 00:29:21,790
Maybe vultures.

343
00:29:34,389 --> 00:29:36,442
What if we anger the vultures?

344
00:29:39,151 --> 00:29:41,623
They've probably heard us
and flown away.

345
00:29:43,305 --> 00:29:44,379
As I told you,

346
00:29:44,380 --> 00:29:48,022
this is what the Zoroastrians
leave their dead to the vultures.

347
00:29:49,459 --> 00:29:51,514
They considered them sacred.

348
00:30:04,030 --> 00:30:05,407
You're scared?

349
00:30:07,048 --> 00:30:08,693
I'm not afraid.

350
00:30:20,394 --> 00:30:22,671
Gertrude Lowthian Bell.

351
00:30:23,568 --> 00:30:25,415
I wish to kiss you.

352
00:30:42,238 --> 00:30:44,236
Maybe we shouldn't do it here.

353
00:30:45,974 --> 00:30:47,492
Run. Come on.

354
00:32:21,547 --> 00:32:23,819
Florence,
stop that moody brooding.

355
00:32:23,821 --> 00:32:25,981
- Father...
- Frank.

356
00:32:25,983 --> 00:32:28,738
- Don't Frank me.
- She's a girl.

357
00:32:28,740 --> 00:32:31,301
My dinner table is a no cry zone.

358
00:32:31,830 --> 00:32:35,008
I'm sorry I gave birth to a daughter.
You wanted a boy, obviously.

359
00:32:35,010 --> 00:32:36,081
Absolutely not!

360
00:32:36,082 --> 00:32:38,871
You could've born me a dromedary,
and I would have minded.

361
00:32:41,176 --> 00:32:43,214
Now look, darling.

362
00:32:43,216 --> 00:32:45,708
There is a good side about tears.

363
00:32:46,063 --> 00:32:49,180
If you cry them out,
you need to pee much less.

364
00:33:02,541 --> 00:33:04,509
Let's smoke a cigar together.

365
00:33:08,708 --> 00:33:10,182
- Bread.
- Yeah.

366
00:33:10,184 --> 00:33:11,788
A piece of bread.

367
00:33:13,187 --> 00:33:15,231
A loaf of bread.

368
00:33:17,461 --> 00:33:20,449
Sharab wine.
A flask of wine.

369
00:33:21,708 --> 00:33:23,027
And so...

370
00:33:24,621 --> 00:33:25,971
You're doing so well.

371
00:33:25,973 --> 00:33:27,777
- I am?
- Yes.

372
00:33:29,319 --> 00:33:35,071
"A loaf of bread beneath the bough.
A flask of wine, a book of verse.

373
00:33:35,754 --> 00:33:40,753
"And Thou beside me
singing in the wilderness.

374
00:33:40,906 --> 00:33:45,209
"And wilderness is paradise enow."

375
00:33:47,783 --> 00:33:49,040
More.

376
00:33:50,437 --> 00:33:51,871
Look at this verse.

377
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:58,587
"The bird of time has but a little way.

378
00:33:58,864 --> 00:34:00,544
"To fly."

379
00:34:15,953 --> 00:34:18,851
- Alexander the Great.
- Yeah.

380
00:34:20,428 --> 00:34:23,700
That's 2,200 years looking at you.

381
00:34:25,448 --> 00:34:28,084
- It is for me?
- No.

382
00:34:31,279 --> 00:34:33,013
Only half.

383
00:34:34,167 --> 00:34:36,681
I had a silversmith tie it in two.

384
00:34:37,758 --> 00:34:40,897
So half is for you
and half is for me.

385
00:34:52,258 --> 00:34:54,219
Wherever you are in the world,

386
00:34:55,133 --> 00:34:57,105
and wherever I might be,

387
00:34:57,310 --> 00:34:59,742
this is proof
that we belong to each other.

388
00:35:01,308 --> 00:35:05,685
And if one of us dies,
then the other keeps the whole coin.

389
00:35:07,105 --> 00:35:08,835
Henry.

390
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:20,485
Gertrude Lowthian Bell,

391
00:35:22,148 --> 00:35:23,903
will you marry me?

392
00:35:26,696 --> 00:35:28,691
Did I hear you correctly?

393
00:35:29,881 --> 00:35:32,669
Yes, marry me.
Will you marry me ?

394
00:35:35,916 --> 00:35:37,842
Shouldn't you get down
on your knees?

395
00:35:38,448 --> 00:35:39,887
Oh, no.

396
00:35:43,032 --> 00:35:44,699
I did it wrong.

397
00:35:50,115 --> 00:35:51,777
- Yes.
- Yes?

398
00:35:55,067 --> 00:35:58,127
Alright, will you marry me?

399
00:36:00,002 --> 00:36:01,265
I will.

400
00:36:23,482 --> 00:36:24,695
Henry?

401
00:36:27,669 --> 00:36:29,248
What are you doing?

402
00:36:34,667 --> 00:36:37,632
How did you pass
the security guards with a ladder?

403
00:36:41,637 --> 00:36:45,198
I know how to do
all the most important things in life.

404
00:36:45,458 --> 00:36:48,167
But you could've fallen
into your daddy.

405
00:36:55,489 --> 00:36:59,495
It was very important
that I solve a particular mystery.

406
00:36:59,863 --> 00:37:01,461
What mystery?

407
00:37:03,059 --> 00:37:04,699
Well, you see...

408
00:37:05,530 --> 00:37:07,295
I love your smile.

409
00:37:08,837 --> 00:37:12,794
But many men
in love with a woman's smile

410
00:37:12,796 --> 00:37:17,252
have made the mistake
of marrying the whole girl.

411
00:37:28,095 --> 00:37:29,879
Here's the whole girl.

412
00:38:06,324 --> 00:38:08,918
I wonder
why my father hasn't answered me.

413
00:38:09,907 --> 00:38:11,888
Don't worry,
there's always a delay

414
00:38:11,890 --> 00:38:15,293
because the mail needs to be sorted
in the foreign office in London.

415
00:38:15,295 --> 00:38:17,737
Two days ago I sent a telegram.

416
00:38:18,404 --> 00:38:20,181
You sent a telegram?

417
00:38:20,183 --> 00:38:21,503
From the embassy?

418
00:38:21,505 --> 00:38:24,596
- So... everyone knows about us?
- No.

419
00:38:24,598 --> 00:38:27,973
No, I only said:
"Have you sent an answer?"

420
00:38:29,733 --> 00:38:31,196
And I've heard nothing.

421
00:38:31,198 --> 00:38:33,378
Nothing from him.

422
00:38:34,862 --> 00:38:36,640
I'm worried.

423
00:39:00,202 --> 00:39:02,277
Can I help you?

424
00:39:04,223 --> 00:39:08,089
From dispatch.
I don't have a telegram.

425
00:39:08,802 --> 00:39:11,716
But I noticed that the mail woman
had this letter for you.

426
00:39:13,119 --> 00:39:14,828
I knew you were waiting.

427
00:39:14,830 --> 00:39:16,805
I'm always here for you.

428
00:39:18,661 --> 00:39:19,754
I would...

429
00:39:20,459 --> 00:39:22,831
- I would...
- Would what?

430
00:39:24,433 --> 00:39:27,094
I would give my life
for a woman like you.

431
00:40:42,018 --> 00:40:45,256
I shall return home,
I shall speak to my father.

432
00:40:56,488 --> 00:40:59,270
Love is lawless. Don't go.

433
00:41:23,347 --> 00:41:26,391
His credentials are not impressive.

434
00:41:26,393 --> 00:41:28,276
I don't care.

435
00:41:28,278 --> 00:41:31,313
Do you have any idea
how little the junior diplomat earns?

436
00:41:31,315 --> 00:41:34,914
I could live in a tent - a tent! -
with the man I love.

437
00:41:34,916 --> 00:41:37,827
What I have found out about him
and what you probably do not know...

438
00:41:37,829 --> 00:41:38,923
I know everything.

439
00:41:38,925 --> 00:41:41,211
What you probably do not know
is the man's a gambler.

440
00:41:41,213 --> 00:41:44,389
He has accumulated significant debts.

441
00:41:45,144 --> 00:41:47,534
And you had an enormous debt.

442
00:41:47,536 --> 00:41:49,737
When you started your steel mill.
You did.

443
00:41:49,739 --> 00:41:51,847
- My answer remains no.
- Why ?

444
00:41:51,849 --> 00:41:55,449
I will not give my consent to this...

445
00:41:55,871 --> 00:41:58,259
This childish plan.

446
00:42:13,799 --> 00:42:17,058
<i>The nightingale with the drops
Of his heart's blood</i>

447
00:42:17,060 --> 00:42:20,218
<i>Had nourished the red rose.</i>

448
00:42:22,224 --> 00:42:24,078
<i>Then came the wind.</i>

449
00:42:27,615 --> 00:42:30,645
<i>And catching at the boughs
in envious mood,</i>

450
00:42:30,647 --> 00:42:34,175
<i>a hundred thorns
about his heart entwined.</i>

451
00:43:20,172 --> 00:43:23,948
This just arrived by diplomatic pouch
from Tehran.

452
00:43:26,958 --> 00:43:32,952
It says that the coin
and the clothes of Mr. Henry Cadogan

453
00:43:33,054 --> 00:43:36,929
were found neatly arranged
on a rock by the river.

454
00:43:41,733 --> 00:43:45,050
Cadogan's body was found
the following day

455
00:43:45,052 --> 00:43:48,219
at the bottom of a cliff.

456
00:43:49,329 --> 00:43:51,384
On the opposite side of the river.

457
00:43:53,969 --> 00:43:57,883
The embassy regret to inform you
about this tragic accident.

458
00:44:01,661 --> 00:44:03,714
It was no accident.

459
00:44:07,315 --> 00:44:10,692
There's also
a short note from Cadogan,

460
00:44:10,694 --> 00:44:12,472
which I hesitate to give to you.

461
00:44:21,432 --> 00:44:22,930
Gertrude, I'll leave you now.

462
00:44:32,241 --> 00:44:36,883
<i>Eternal love doth keep
In his complacent arms</i>

463
00:44:37,489 --> 00:44:41,478
<i>The earth, the air, the deep.</i>

464
00:45:19,548 --> 00:45:22,673
<i>Light of mine eyes
and harvest of my heart</i>

465
00:45:23,743 --> 00:45:26,319
<i>And mine at last
in changeless memory</i>

466
00:45:26,786 --> 00:45:29,650
<i>Ah! When he found it easy to depart</i>

467
00:45:29,652 --> 00:45:32,726
<i>He left the harder pilgrimage to me</i>

468
00:45:33,994 --> 00:45:36,346
<i>Oh Camel-driver
Though the cordage start</i>

469
00:45:36,446 --> 00:45:39,359
<i>For God's sake
Help me lift the fallen load</i>

470
00:45:40,097 --> 00:45:42,697
<i>And pity be my comrade of the road</i>

471
00:45:48,430 --> 00:45:52,081
<i>My face is seamed with dust
Mine eyes are wet</i>

472
00:45:52,897 --> 00:45:55,876
<i>Of dust and tears
The turquoise firmament</i>

473
00:45:55,878 --> 00:46:00,163
<i>Kneadeth the bricks for joy's abode.
And yet,</i>

474
00:46:00,263 --> 00:46:03,648
<i>I had not castled
And the time is gone.</i>

475
00:46:05,831 --> 00:46:07,339
<i>What shall I play?</i>

476
00:46:07,439 --> 00:46:10,859
<i>Upon the chequered floor
Of night and day</i>

477
00:46:11,701 --> 00:46:13,317
<i>Death won the game.</i>

478
00:47:01,025 --> 00:47:05,606
<i>For the first time in my life
I know who I am.</i>

479
00:47:07,317 --> 00:47:09,886
<i>My heart belongs to no one now,
but the desert.</i>

480
00:47:21,405 --> 00:47:23,480
- For years.
- Years ?

481
00:47:25,098 --> 00:47:29,804
But why venturing out in the desert,
in times of war?

482
00:47:30,801 --> 00:47:33,566
Have you ever experienced the desert?

483
00:47:34,674 --> 00:47:36,074
What does that got to do with it?

484
00:47:37,018 --> 00:47:40,528
What I would like to know is this:
what brings you here?

485
00:47:40,628 --> 00:47:43,187
Why did you leave England for good,
as you say?

486
00:47:43,189 --> 00:47:45,976
To be honest,
I did not fully understood myself.

487
00:47:46,176 --> 00:47:47,887
But I did have my moment of epiphany.

488
00:47:48,242 --> 00:47:50,532
Miss Bell, allow me to be candid.

489
00:47:51,038 --> 00:47:53,093
This sounds pathetic.

490
00:47:56,099 --> 00:47:57,940
And what are your intentions?

491
00:47:58,917 --> 00:48:02,674
My intentions
are to move out there

492
00:48:02,774 --> 00:48:05,233
and do some archaeological research.

493
00:48:05,604 --> 00:48:07,301
- Study the Bedouins.
- The Bedouins?

494
00:48:10,222 --> 00:48:12,375
This is not going to happen.

495
00:48:13,712 --> 00:48:17,367
May I remind you
they're under Turkish administration.

496
00:48:17,369 --> 00:48:19,553
Are you going
to ask for their permit?

497
00:48:19,555 --> 00:48:22,707
No, and I'm not going
to ask for your permit either.

498
00:48:24,826 --> 00:48:26,729
Do not forget one thing.

499
00:48:26,984 --> 00:48:31,122
Do not forget that soon,
we intend to inherit their empire

500
00:48:31,124 --> 00:48:35,900
I do not want trouble
for our ongoing efforts.

501
00:48:35,902 --> 00:48:39,074
You will not
stir up confrontation with Turkey

502
00:48:39,075 --> 00:48:42,391
because of the Bedouins.
They are feuding among themselves.

503
00:48:42,491 --> 00:48:48,259
Now this little venture of yours
is counterproductive and dangerous.

504
00:48:48,947 --> 00:48:52,130
You have no power to stop me.

505
00:48:54,821 --> 00:48:58,340
You will not leave.

506
00:48:58,341 --> 00:48:59,341
Yes, I will.

507
00:48:59,292 --> 00:49:01,856
I have already been out there
and I'm going back.

508
00:49:01,858 --> 00:49:03,355
Good day, gentlemen.

509
00:49:03,357 --> 00:49:05,369
Ms. Bell, even if it costs me

510
00:49:05,370 --> 00:49:07,871
to let the Turkish authorities know
about your plans,

511
00:49:07,971 --> 00:49:09,493
they will intercept you.

512
00:49:10,126 --> 00:49:14,396
This silly business of yours
is not going to happen!

513
00:49:35,583 --> 00:49:37,689
- Fattuh.
- Yes, Ms. Bell.

514
00:49:38,148 --> 00:49:42,701
Do you know and the rest of the men
know that we may all be arrested?

515
00:49:42,703 --> 00:49:44,331
I'm prepared.

516
00:49:45,587 --> 00:49:47,148
Even for that?

517
00:49:47,150 --> 00:49:49,081
Fattuh is always prepared.

518
00:50:08,898 --> 00:50:10,632
You are under arrest!

519
00:50:10,634 --> 00:50:12,537
All of you are under arrest!

520
00:50:17,473 --> 00:50:21,302
Lieutenant, is there something
I can help you with?

521
00:50:21,304 --> 00:50:23,700
Who allowed you to leave
in the middle of the night,

522
00:50:23,702 --> 00:50:25,771
without a permit
by the authorities?

523
00:50:25,773 --> 00:50:29,094
- There must be some misunderstanding...
- We do have a permit.

524
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:33,612
- You, who are you?
- I'm Fattuh. The servant of Ms. Bell.

525
00:50:35,645 --> 00:50:39,548
Ms. Gertrude Bell, I know who you are.
Do you have any weapons?

526
00:50:40,249 --> 00:50:42,090
No. We do not.

527
00:50:54,269 --> 00:50:57,463
- This document comes directly...
- It comes directly from Istanbul.

528
00:50:57,465 --> 00:50:59,034
Directly from the ministry.

529
00:51:00,244 --> 00:51:03,045
Ms. Bell, I'm so sorry.

530
00:51:03,975 --> 00:51:06,016
I heard from our headquarters
in Amman...

531
00:51:06,018 --> 00:51:09,688
A man probably just was not
notified by your government.

532
00:51:10,911 --> 00:51:14,160
The ways of bureaucracy are labyrinthal.
It's always the same, even in London.

533
00:51:14,162 --> 00:51:16,749
In our Foreign Office, so...

534
00:51:16,751 --> 00:51:19,057
- Is that so?
- Yes. Yes.

535
00:51:22,289 --> 00:51:23,732
Thank you, Lieutenant.

536
00:51:23,734 --> 00:51:26,198
Your horses look like
they need some water.

537
00:51:26,200 --> 00:51:28,189
Would you like to share
a moment with us?

538
00:51:35,124 --> 00:51:37,197
Where did you get the permit?

539
00:51:37,199 --> 00:51:40,464
I know this scribe
in the main mosque in Amman.

540
00:51:40,466 --> 00:51:43,347
He can forge anything
for a good baksheesh.

541
00:51:43,349 --> 00:51:45,265
Fattuh.

542
00:51:50,132 --> 00:51:51,615
Lieutenant.

543
00:51:52,006 --> 00:51:55,420
Did you come from the garrison
at the railway?

544
00:51:55,777 --> 00:51:57,522
Yes, lady.

545
00:51:58,197 --> 00:52:00,462
And how many cavalries
are stationed there?

546
00:52:01,186 --> 00:52:02,605
About 60.

547
00:52:02,607 --> 00:52:04,526
But their numbers are dwindling.

548
00:52:04,528 --> 00:52:06,374
We were 100 in April.

549
00:52:06,376 --> 00:52:09,212
- Artillery?
- All gone.

550
00:52:09,890 --> 00:52:11,536
I should not tell you that.

551
00:52:12,488 --> 00:52:14,314
I'm just a traveller
and a scientist.

552
00:52:14,414 --> 00:52:17,587
Everyone knows
that the forces of the Ottoman Empire

553
00:52:17,588 --> 00:52:19,385
are somewhat overstretched.

554
00:52:19,420 --> 00:52:21,756
Besides, it's all officially
in the papers.

555
00:52:22,896 --> 00:52:25,256
But my outpost is not in the papers.

556
00:52:27,451 --> 00:52:29,229
Lieutenant.

557
00:52:29,231 --> 00:52:31,472
I would like
to offer you a photograph.

558
00:52:32,928 --> 00:52:34,678
You are very kind, lady Bell.

559
00:52:34,680 --> 00:52:37,452
- You and your men. Do you accept?
- Yes, I'd like to.

560
00:52:38,794 --> 00:52:42,437
Because I do not wish
to carry a military secret,

561
00:52:42,439 --> 00:52:46,035
I'm going to give you
the exposed negative.

562
00:52:46,469 --> 00:52:48,925
- You can have it developed in Amman.
- Thank you.

563
00:52:52,250 --> 00:52:54,274
I would say right in the middle.

564
00:52:55,189 --> 00:52:56,615
Yes.

565
00:52:57,304 --> 00:52:59,454
The light is beautiful.

566
00:52:59,456 --> 00:53:00,857
Over here.

567
00:53:03,585 --> 00:53:04,963
Superb.

568
00:55:44,637 --> 00:55:46,292
<i>Dear diary,</i>

569
00:55:46,294 --> 00:55:51,063
<i>we have reached an oasis
that is something from a Bedouin fable.</i>

570
00:55:51,927 --> 00:55:56,236
<i>The solitude of the desert
gives me consolation in my own solitude.</i>

571
00:55:58,421 --> 00:56:02,518
<i>Fattuh asked me
why I always request two glasses of tea.</i>

572
00:56:04,165 --> 00:56:05,227
<i>Should I tell him</i>

573
00:56:05,228 --> 00:56:08,164
<i>this is for the man
who lives in my heart?</i>

574
00:57:05,618 --> 00:57:09,281
<i>Day in, day out.
We keep moving ahead.</i>

575
00:57:09,283 --> 00:57:12,798
<i>And setting up camp
is the same familiar routine.</i>

576
00:57:13,863 --> 00:57:16,928
<i>But the deeper we immerse
ourselves into the desert</i>

577
00:57:17,579 --> 00:57:20,205
<i>The more everything seems like a dream.</i>

578
00:57:22,091 --> 00:57:25,824
<i>Some days we move across terrain
that is almost impassable.</i>

579
00:57:26,564 --> 00:57:31,059
<i>Like the hard crust of salt,
like shards of broken porcelain.</i>

580
00:57:34,075 --> 00:57:39,576
<i>Often I don't follow any map,
but merely go where my curiosity leads me.</i>

581
00:57:42,180 --> 00:57:46,387
<i>East of the Dead Sea
I explored the hidden gorge of Wadi Mujib.</i>

582
00:57:47,235 --> 00:57:50,922
<i>I never expected
to find water so fresh in the desert.</i>

583
00:57:56,236 --> 00:57:59,758
<i>The deeper I penetrate
this mysterious labyrinth</i>

584
00:58:00,405 --> 00:58:02,993
<i>The more I become known to myself</i>

585
00:58:28,273 --> 00:58:32,201
<i>Near the end of the gorge,
Fattuh found something curious.</i>

586
00:58:33,094 --> 00:58:35,850
<i>It turned out to be a Neolithic spear.</i>

587
00:58:35,852 --> 00:58:38,345
<i>At least 10,000 years old.</i>

588
00:58:41,744 --> 00:58:44,528
<i>I speculated
that in prehistoric times,</i>

589
00:58:44,529 --> 00:58:45,929
<i>there must have been war here.</i>

590
00:58:46,664 --> 00:58:49,517
<i>And that this must have been
a very defensible place.</i>

591
00:58:50,317 --> 00:58:52,909
<i>But Fattuh said:
"This cannot be."</i>

592
00:58:53,491 --> 00:58:56,162
<i>At such an early time,
the world was paradise.</i>

593
00:58:56,735 --> 00:59:00,857
<i>And paradise is meant to come upon us
again if we leave a righteous life.</i>

594
00:59:01,752 --> 00:59:03,582
<i>As foretold by the Prophet.</i>

595
00:59:04,568 --> 00:59:08,847
<i>Paradise has no time,
no age, no dwelling place.</i>

596
00:59:09,832 --> 00:59:11,261
<i>It awaits us.</i>

597
00:59:15,394 --> 00:59:18,581
<i>This made me eager
to go deeper into archaeology.</i>

598
00:59:20,264 --> 00:59:24,197
<i>Not far from the gorge
is the British excavation site of Petra.</i>

599
00:59:26,914 --> 00:59:30,597
<i>It was a hard day's travel
because of the arrival of early rain.</i>

600
00:59:32,672 --> 00:59:34,228
Greetings.

601
00:59:34,230 --> 00:59:36,338
Welcome, Ms. Bell!

602
00:59:36,340 --> 00:59:38,028
Welcome to our home!

603
00:59:38,397 --> 00:59:41,887
I'm Campbell Thompson.
This is my colleague, T.E. Lawrence.

604
00:59:43,214 --> 00:59:46,049
And what does "T.E." stand for?

605
00:59:47,655 --> 00:59:49,501
T.E. stands for Edward Thomas.

606
00:59:50,322 --> 00:59:52,599
I despise both names.
They're an abomination.

607
00:59:52,912 --> 00:59:56,083
- Please just call me Lawrence.
- Will do, Lawrence.

608
00:59:56,547 --> 00:59:58,111
We knew you were coming.

609
00:59:58,113 --> 01:00:00,612
Really? We didn't send messengers.

610
01:00:00,969 --> 01:00:02,945
A meeting of the stars
saw you at night,

611
01:00:02,947 --> 01:00:05,818
and during the day,
the sand down your footsteps.

612
01:00:06,746 --> 01:00:09,149
Sorry, he's always like this.

613
01:00:11,313 --> 01:00:14,250
What's a school boy like you
doing here, Lawrence?

614
01:00:14,252 --> 01:00:17,630
This particular school boy
has a Ph.D. in archaeology.

615
01:00:17,632 --> 01:00:18,814
Thompson...

616
01:00:19,118 --> 01:00:21,624
I have a Ph.D.
in medieval pottery shards.

617
01:00:21,626 --> 01:00:24,950
It follows me around like
the wafting of an old spinster's fart.

618
01:00:25,736 --> 01:00:27,661
How I long to be rid of it!

619
01:00:28,982 --> 01:00:30,168
Shall we?

620
01:00:44,794 --> 01:00:46,275
This place is a dump.

621
01:00:47,290 --> 01:00:49,384
Everything has been moved
by grave robbers.

622
01:00:49,386 --> 01:00:50,832
Over and over again.

623
01:00:51,747 --> 01:00:53,098
We're simply stuck here.

624
01:00:53,100 --> 01:00:56,310
Lawrence dreams of great treasures,
hoards of gold.

625
01:00:57,857 --> 01:00:59,020
At least...

626
01:00:59,022 --> 01:01:02,486
God Almighty, give us
a library of Babylonian clay tablets

627
01:01:02,586 --> 01:01:04,896
the likes that the Germans
have excavated in Mesopotamia.

628
01:01:05,246 --> 01:01:08,302
Our excavation methods
are no match for theirs.

629
01:01:09,105 --> 01:01:10,964
This is true, Gertrude, darling.

630
01:01:13,375 --> 01:01:14,726
"Darling".

631
01:01:16,696 --> 01:01:19,480
You know, I made a big mistake
wearing this belt here.

632
01:01:20,372 --> 01:01:22,962
That kind of belt
is only worn by bachelors.

633
01:01:23,532 --> 01:01:24,642
And...?

634
01:01:24,644 --> 01:01:27,581
And... the local excavation workers

635
01:01:27,583 --> 01:01:29,785
have been trying to find me a wife.

636
01:01:30,487 --> 01:01:32,844
Imagine. A wife for me.
How horrible!

637
01:01:33,985 --> 01:01:35,726
But they heard of your arrival

638
01:01:35,727 --> 01:01:38,676
and instant rumour spread
that you're my bride,

639
01:01:38,776 --> 01:01:40,061
sent from England.

640
01:01:43,368 --> 01:01:46,107
I'm not sure the right man for you
had been born yet.

641
01:01:50,933 --> 01:01:53,277
To me, the Ottoman Empire
can't last much longer

642
01:01:53,377 --> 01:01:56,398
and it looks like the Roman Empire
shall disappear before its collapse.

643
01:01:56,400 --> 01:01:58,336
What do you think's gonna happen?

644
01:02:00,239 --> 01:02:01,241
Chaos.

645
01:02:02,514 --> 01:02:03,963
Chaos and war.

646
01:02:05,436 --> 01:02:07,411
Maybe the British Empire
will take over

647
01:02:07,411 --> 01:02:10,054
- and  fill the void of power?
- No, I beg to differ.

648
01:02:11,435 --> 01:02:15,639
I believe it with the Arabs who's a spirited nation
it will emerge.

649
01:02:16,382 --> 01:02:17,854
They are the future.

650
01:02:18,665 --> 01:02:20,064
Perhaps, but...

651
01:02:20,422 --> 01:02:24,615
Any meaningful change
may take centuries to launch.

652
01:02:24,715 --> 01:02:27,331
- It will happen in our lifetime...
- Enough politics.

653
01:02:27,333 --> 01:02:28,756
Or in a few decades.

654
01:02:28,758 --> 01:02:31,215
We are archaeologists.

655
01:02:31,217 --> 01:02:33,191
So far, I am only a traveller.

656
01:02:33,193 --> 01:02:35,551
Well then, to the travellers.

657
01:02:35,553 --> 01:02:40,081
And to those who dig up mysteries
from under the surface.

658
01:02:41,949 --> 01:02:43,969
I'm sorry, we have no glasses.

659
01:02:51,197 --> 01:02:52,590
You know what, Gertrude?

660
01:02:54,032 --> 01:02:56,226
Regardless of what anyone says,

661
01:02:56,228 --> 01:02:59,168
under the benign,
soft glove of camp fire

662
01:02:59,170 --> 01:03:01,642
with good scotch in your fist,

663
01:03:01,644 --> 01:03:03,562
you'd make an terrific bride.

664
01:03:33,552 --> 01:03:35,119
Gertie!

665
01:03:36,085 --> 01:03:37,653
You had breakfast yet?

666
01:03:38,484 --> 01:03:40,343
Got a hangover.

667
01:03:42,660 --> 01:03:46,025
I have a Roman Empire size headache.

668
01:03:46,448 --> 01:03:49,321
What a shame
we do not have Rome set on fire

669
01:03:49,323 --> 01:03:52,818
and Nero singing to us live.
I've been moaning the conflagration.

670
01:03:52,820 --> 01:03:54,900
He himself started the fire
under the right mood.

671
01:03:54,902 --> 01:03:58,352
- Those were the good days.
- Lawrence, keep it down.

672
01:03:59,693 --> 01:04:00,820
Gertie.

673
01:04:01,770 --> 01:04:03,289
You can't leave.

674
01:04:03,680 --> 01:04:07,025
The local women might try
to find me a wife.

675
01:04:08,670 --> 01:04:10,823
Do you want me to kiss you
in front of everyone?

676
01:04:10,920 --> 01:04:12,209
Absolutely.

677
01:04:13,590 --> 01:04:14,711
My kiss...

678
01:04:15,995 --> 01:04:17,718
My kiss shall liberate you.

679
01:04:17,884 --> 01:04:19,101
Wonderful!

680
01:04:23,913 --> 01:04:25,129
Gertie...

681
01:04:26,209 --> 01:04:28,041
would you, please, not marry me?

682
01:04:28,900 --> 01:04:30,525
Absolutely.

683
01:04:43,569 --> 01:04:45,145
Please, do come in.

684
01:04:45,891 --> 01:04:47,916
Ms. Bell, the consul.

685
01:04:48,230 --> 01:04:51,987
Ms. Bell... welcome!

686
01:04:52,690 --> 01:04:53,752
Welcome back!

687
01:04:54,918 --> 01:04:57,587
Before we talk business,
allow me to congratulate you

688
01:04:57,687 --> 01:05:00,193
on your feat of alluding
the Turkish authorities.

689
01:05:00,520 --> 01:05:03,333
Well, I had a permit,
if you know what I mean.

690
01:05:03,640 --> 01:05:05,351
How did you forge it?

691
01:05:06,190 --> 01:05:09,956
It wasn't me, it was a scribe
from the Great Mosque.

692
01:05:10,056 --> 01:05:11,407
One of the finest.

693
01:05:12,250 --> 01:05:14,583
Yes, it was my servant
who contacted him.

694
01:05:14,623 --> 01:05:16,940
I'm sure if you ever needed
a document, we could arrange.

695
01:05:17,040 --> 01:05:19,201
The British Empire has no need
for such petty tricks.

696
01:05:19,200 --> 01:05:20,254
No.

697
01:05:20,260 --> 01:05:22,610
Except for printing millions
of counterfeit Deutsch marks

698
01:05:22,710 --> 01:05:25,123
and Turkish piasters,
in order to undermine their economies.

699
01:05:25,504 --> 01:05:27,434
Please, take a seat.

700
01:05:30,190 --> 01:05:31,752
Well...

701
01:05:36,160 --> 01:05:39,642
I'm here to inform you of my plans
to travel to Jabal Al-Druze.

702
01:05:39,918 --> 01:05:41,339
You can't be serious.

703
01:05:41,340 --> 01:05:42,340
Yes, I most certainly am.

704
01:05:43,230 --> 01:05:45,365
No one has travelled
to the Druze in decades.

705
01:05:46,090 --> 01:05:48,124
So it's about time.

706
01:05:49,340 --> 01:05:51,540
No British soldier will accompany you,
Ms. Bell.

707
01:05:52,090 --> 01:05:54,335
It'd mean a provocation
for the Druze people.

708
01:05:54,470 --> 01:05:56,942
- I myself as a soldier...
- Major...

709
01:05:57,030 --> 01:05:59,134
Major of the Royal Welch Fusiliers.

710
01:06:01,760 --> 01:06:04,372
Ms. Bell, we seem to know quite a lot
about each other already.

711
01:06:04,407 --> 01:06:05,420
Major...

712
01:06:06,623 --> 01:06:10,700
I'm here to ask you for what you're already
so graciously volunteering.

713
01:06:11,210 --> 01:06:13,472
Even if you do not hear from me
for several months

714
01:06:13,572 --> 01:06:15,301
pay no attention and send no one.

715
01:06:17,960 --> 01:06:21,468
- The Druze will take you for a spy.
- Yeah, or maybe I am.

716
01:06:21,740 --> 01:06:25,054
Maybe I am a spy,
but I am a spy for no one.

717
01:06:25,055 --> 01:06:27,241
No one but myself.

718
01:06:36,025 --> 01:06:37,469
I am the consul's wife.

719
01:06:37,504 --> 01:06:39,620
- Yes.
- Don't be so formal, dear.

720
01:06:40,485 --> 01:06:43,045
Ms. Bell, this is Judith. Welcome.

721
01:06:43,154 --> 01:06:45,303
I brought you a present.

722
01:06:45,338 --> 01:06:47,168
One for each of you.

723
01:06:48,203 --> 01:06:49,855
This is very kind.

724
01:06:49,890 --> 01:06:51,651
It's just something I found in a souk.

725
01:06:51,686 --> 01:06:54,470
- What do I do with it?
- That's beautiful.

726
01:06:54,870 --> 01:06:58,985
My love, use them in the kitchen
for your onions.

727
01:07:00,414 --> 01:07:01,512
Come.

728
01:07:06,390 --> 01:07:09,179
But the Druze are fiercely independent.

729
01:07:09,340 --> 01:07:11,331
And more than anything, anti-Turkish.

730
01:07:11,944 --> 01:07:14,802
In fact, they're the only people ever
to have defeated the Turks.

731
01:07:14,837 --> 01:07:17,289
Ans this is what makes them
so interesting.

732
01:07:17,670 --> 01:07:21,153
Besides, their faith incorporates
Christian, Gnostic, Neoplatonic,

733
01:07:21,253 --> 01:07:23,133
which overlay their Islamic beliefs.

734
01:07:23,140 --> 01:07:25,140
Please, let's not talk about Plato.

735
01:07:26,674 --> 01:07:28,141
Would you like
some more of the couscous?

736
01:07:28,142 --> 01:07:29,142
We're not talking about Plato,
my love.

737
01:07:30,650 --> 01:07:33,903
We're talking about a very grave danger:
Ms. Bell's faith.

738
01:07:34,362 --> 01:07:35,754
It will be worthwhile.

739
01:07:37,320 --> 01:07:38,918
Be careful.

740
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:41,431
The Druze do not play the game
as it should be played.

741
01:07:41,610 --> 01:07:45,470
They go out to slay,
and they spare no one.

742
01:07:45,670 --> 01:07:48,210
While they have enough
dry powder in their flasks,

743
01:07:48,211 --> 01:07:49,747
and strength to pull the trigger,

744
01:07:50,200 --> 01:07:52,721
they kill every man,
woman and child they encounter.

745
01:07:52,756 --> 01:07:54,209
How awful!

746
01:08:04,937 --> 01:08:07,840
- What?
- I want you to have them.

747
01:08:10,190 --> 01:08:11,230
No...

748
01:08:11,520 --> 01:08:13,250
No, it's too much.

749
01:08:15,100 --> 01:08:16,125
Dear...

750
01:08:16,234 --> 01:08:20,241
Have you no said on several occasions
you would never give these pistols away?

751
01:08:22,142 --> 01:08:23,178
Well...

752
01:08:24,905 --> 01:08:27,473
Now they are, given away.

753
01:08:28,534 --> 01:08:30,713
Ms. Bell, for you.

754
01:08:32,800 --> 01:08:34,199
For me?

755
01:09:04,841 --> 01:09:08,809
<i>We are travelling across
the vast expanse of Bedouin lands.</i>

756
01:09:08,810 --> 01:09:11,451
<i>And my eyes are opening
to the complexity</i>

757
01:09:11,752 --> 01:09:14,130
<i>of tribal relations here.</i>

758
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:18,626
<i>Fattuh has been my gracious teacher
in all of this.</i>

759
01:09:18,661 --> 01:09:23,190
<i>He says the most volatile conflict
is between the Druze and the Beni Sakhr.</i>

760
01:09:29,500 --> 01:09:32,221
My worry is Omar, Ms. Bell.

761
01:09:34,578 --> 01:09:37,079
Yes, I only found out this morning
that he was Beni Sakhr.

762
01:09:40,134 --> 01:09:41,409
Should we leave him behind?

763
01:09:41,990 --> 01:09:44,694
There's no mercy
between Druze and Beni Sakhr.

764
01:09:44,794 --> 01:09:48,340
If two of them meet, only one survives.

765
01:10:04,739 --> 01:10:05,780
Ms. Bell!

766
01:10:07,310 --> 01:10:08,610
Yes.

767
01:10:09,169 --> 01:10:12,225
I realized that the Druze
would recognize Omar as a Beni Sakhr

768
01:10:12,226 --> 01:10:13,426
by his accent.

769
01:10:13,973 --> 01:10:15,858
I did not think about that.

770
01:10:16,659 --> 01:10:17,811
What do we do?

771
01:10:18,690 --> 01:10:20,155
Ask Omar.

772
01:10:22,249 --> 01:10:25,241
Omar, should I send you back
before it's too late?

773
01:10:31,779 --> 01:10:33,410
Omar suddenly became a deaf-mute.

774
01:10:35,026 --> 01:10:36,047
When?

775
01:10:36,140 --> 01:10:37,706
An hour ago.

776
01:11:16,174 --> 01:11:18,525
You are my prisoners, you'll die!

777
01:11:18,526 --> 01:11:20,585
- All of you!
- If I die...

778
01:11:22,249 --> 01:11:23,698
it should be
at the hands of your sheik.

779
01:11:24,935 --> 01:11:26,960
Where's your sheik?
Take me to him.

780
01:11:26,995 --> 01:11:29,373
- Ms. Bell, you're wounded!
- Nothing.

781
01:11:30,120 --> 01:11:33,220
Nothing.
Give me your sheik now!

782
01:11:35,150 --> 01:11:36,195
Now!

783
01:11:49,850 --> 01:11:52,842
A woman passes through the entrance
at the women's side.

784
01:11:52,877 --> 01:11:55,193
This woman is joining the men.

785
01:12:02,400 --> 01:12:03,500
Sit down.

786
01:12:04,540 --> 01:12:06,212
Sit down, woman.

787
01:12:07,626 --> 01:12:09,046
Please.

788
01:12:10,080 --> 01:12:11,785
Who are you to dare come here?

789
01:12:13,990 --> 01:12:16,020
I'm Gertrude Bell.

790
01:12:16,650 --> 01:12:18,671
And I am a subject
of the British Empire.

791
01:12:20,680 --> 01:12:23,055
Thank the Almighty
that you're not German.

792
01:12:23,090 --> 01:12:24,347
Have a seat, please.

793
01:12:26,300 --> 01:12:28,994
I thank him every day that I am not.

794
01:12:39,150 --> 01:12:42,577
- Are you a spy?
- No.

795
01:12:43,080 --> 01:12:44,476
I'm a writer.

796
01:12:45,460 --> 01:12:49,272
I write about the beauty of the land
and its people.

797
01:12:50,110 --> 01:12:51,672
So, you're a poet.

798
01:12:52,705 --> 01:12:55,990
In a way, but in fact,
I do not describe...

799
01:12:56,350 --> 01:12:57,670
what I see...

800
01:12:59,320 --> 01:13:01,212
I just name its beauty.

801
01:13:02,140 --> 01:13:03,290
Much in the vein of the...

802
01:13:03,820 --> 01:13:06,265
Roman poet Virgil.

803
01:13:06,300 --> 01:13:07,370
He's an Aeneid.

804
01:13:10,020 --> 01:13:11,060
Yes.

805
01:13:14,150 --> 01:13:18,101
I'm so sorry, but how does the sheik
of the Druze know about Virgil?

806
01:13:19,928 --> 01:13:22,669
I have travelled... incognito.

807
01:13:23,810 --> 01:13:25,388
I've been to Damascus.

808
01:13:25,423 --> 01:13:26,751
To Beirut.

809
01:13:26,800 --> 01:13:28,240
To Paris.

810
01:13:29,489 --> 01:13:31,911
Les Champs-Elysées,
la plus belle avenue Du monde.

811
01:13:32,146 --> 01:13:33,561
Baudelaire...

812
01:13:34,020 --> 01:13:36,580
Et ses "Fleurs Du mal". Rimbaud.

813
01:13:38,790 --> 01:13:41,174
You're right,
this poet never describes anything.

814
01:13:41,460 --> 01:13:44,276
He just names
the glory of the trees,

815
01:13:44,480 --> 01:13:45,835
the beehives...

816
01:13:46,830 --> 01:13:48,858
and the life in the country.

817
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:50,907
He's like our poets.

818
01:13:54,030 --> 01:13:55,932
This is true.

819
01:14:00,030 --> 01:14:02,324
May I ask in
one of my trusted men?

820
01:14:02,325 --> 01:14:03,474
Please do.

821
01:14:04,590 --> 01:14:06,596
Fattuh...

822
01:14:07,200 --> 01:14:09,708
would you fetch me my wooden case?

823
01:14:12,160 --> 01:14:13,307
Ms. Bell...

824
01:14:14,060 --> 01:14:16,419
I hope my men didn't hurt you.

825
01:14:17,153 --> 01:14:23,614
They did, but it is a small wound.
It is what we call grace.

826
01:14:25,410 --> 01:14:26,440
Forgive them.

827
01:14:27,190 --> 01:14:29,348
They know no better.

828
01:14:29,649 --> 01:14:30,710
I'm sorry.

829
01:14:34,420 --> 01:14:36,302
I want like to give you a gift.

830
01:14:37,210 --> 01:14:41,690
It is something very precious to me
and it was given to me. And now,

831
01:14:42,420 --> 01:14:43,916
now, it is yours.

832
01:14:52,480 --> 01:14:53,533
Exquisite!

833
01:14:55,066 --> 01:14:57,633
Stay as my guest.

834
01:14:58,770 --> 01:15:01,890
You are under the protection
of our hospitality.

835
01:15:56,820 --> 01:15:58,677
Good to have you back.

836
01:15:59,420 --> 01:16:02,060
A noble bow wound... but alive.

837
01:16:02,161 --> 01:16:04,502
Please, it's nothing. Nothing.

838
01:16:04,940 --> 01:16:06,797
But I have to admit something.

839
01:16:07,100 --> 01:16:10,898
- I gave away your pistols
- They were not mine, but yours.

840
01:16:10,933 --> 01:16:13,000
But you gave them to me.

841
01:16:13,860 --> 01:16:17,280
Finally, it became useful.
It was the purpose.

842
01:16:18,312 --> 01:16:19,700
- I'm sorry.
- Ms. Bell,

843
01:16:19,735 --> 01:16:22,591
will you please keep quiet?
Finally, something happened.

844
01:16:23,292 --> 01:16:24,053
Bullets.

845
01:16:28,810 --> 01:16:32,111
Now I have a new plan,
I want to go to Hayri.

846
01:16:32,146 --> 01:16:35,808
But it is the middle of the Arabian desert.
It's the forbidden zone.

847
01:16:35,843 --> 01:16:39,471
We have only a few reports
from some travellers in the 1950's.

848
01:16:40,750 --> 01:16:42,799
Why for God's sake Hayri?

849
01:16:42,800 --> 01:16:46,203
Because it is the secret epicentre
of the Arab world

850
01:16:46,238 --> 01:16:48,139
and I want to meet the emir Ibn Rashid.

851
01:16:48,440 --> 01:16:51,801
He is important
He is the leader of Arabia.

852
01:16:52,040 --> 01:16:55,070
- Who would be with you?
- Fattuh.

853
01:16:55,100 --> 01:16:56,618
And my men.

854
01:16:58,280 --> 01:16:59,723
What? I trust them.

855
01:17:16,780 --> 01:17:18,284
You arrived too early.

856
01:17:19,020 --> 01:17:21,592
- Want me to come back later?
- No.

857
01:17:21,627 --> 01:17:22,767
No, no, no.

858
01:17:22,802 --> 01:17:24,222
What's going on?

859
01:17:25,360 --> 01:17:28,238
- This stallion is for you.
- For me ?

860
01:17:28,239 --> 01:17:29,974
You'll need the best horse in Arabia.

861
01:17:31,140 --> 01:17:34,836
But you're painting it!
I've never seen anything like it.

862
01:17:34,837 --> 01:17:35,872
Well...

863
01:17:38,198 --> 01:17:40,629
- Well, what?
- I have to make a confession.

864
01:17:43,041 --> 01:17:44,786
I stole him for you!

865
01:17:45,920 --> 01:17:48,097
You stole this horse for me?

866
01:17:48,600 --> 01:17:51,013
See what he can do.

867
01:18:02,170 --> 01:18:03,450
Bravo!

868
01:18:04,212 --> 01:18:06,660
Bravo, Salhadin.

869
01:18:06,770 --> 01:18:07,900
Bravo.

870
01:18:09,230 --> 01:18:12,990
I didn't exactly steal him,
it was more an act of expropriation.

871
01:18:13,220 --> 01:18:16,272
-  Where? From who?
- From the Turkish authorities.

872
01:18:16,307 --> 01:18:17,893
From the enemy, so to speak.

873
01:18:17,894 --> 01:18:18,894
How?

874
01:18:19,419 --> 01:18:21,268
Well, there were  two things I did.

875
01:18:22,230 --> 01:18:24,367
I paid off an editor
of a local newspaper

876
01:18:24,520 --> 01:18:27,580
to write about a disease
spreading among the horses.

877
01:18:28,430 --> 01:18:32,323
Then I took on
a false credentials as a vet,

878
01:18:33,150 --> 01:18:36,235
I went straight to the Turkish garrison,
I inspected the horses

879
01:18:36,270 --> 01:18:40,263
and this here stallion here
had to be removed immediately.

880
01:18:40,760 --> 01:18:43,100
And I put him straight
into quarantine.

881
01:18:44,110 --> 01:18:46,747
So, His Excellency,
the British consul

882
01:18:46,748 --> 01:18:50,043
- Richard Doughty-Wylie...
- I've stolen a horse for you.

883
01:19:06,930 --> 01:19:08,149
Ms. Bell.

884
01:19:08,150 --> 01:19:12,048
- I have summoned you and I...
- No one summons me.

885
01:19:13,487 --> 01:19:16,888
I have... invited you.

886
01:19:16,923 --> 01:19:18,234
That sounds vaguely better.

887
01:19:18,269 --> 01:19:21,533
Yes. Let's get straight to the point,
shall we?

888
01:19:21,568 --> 01:19:26,856
You ventured out,
and I felt not inclined to support this.

889
01:19:27,110 --> 01:19:28,676
To put it mildly.

890
01:19:28,711 --> 01:19:32,660
With the size and momentum
of the Great War that is gaining,

891
01:19:33,040 --> 01:19:35,559
it'd be of considerable value
for our country

892
01:19:35,659 --> 01:19:39,570
if you could make your curiosity
more... systematic.

893
01:19:40,420 --> 01:19:41,723
Meaning what?

894
01:19:41,960 --> 01:19:43,654
You would be our only spy

895
01:19:43,750 --> 01:19:46,862
in a vast area
we have little intelligence about.

896
01:19:47,974 --> 01:19:50,641
In short... no.

897
01:19:51,510 --> 01:19:54,215
- A blunt no.
- Correct. A blunt no.

898
01:19:55,474 --> 01:19:57,058
I operate for no one.

899
01:19:58,700 --> 01:20:03,046
What is it then that attracts you
to the Bedouin out there?

900
01:20:03,047 --> 01:20:06,308
It is something that you and your world
would never understand.

901
01:20:08,009 --> 01:20:09,149
It's their freedom.

902
01:20:09,960 --> 01:20:11,503
It's their dignity.

903
01:20:13,667 --> 01:20:15,820
It's their poetry of life.

904
01:20:20,660 --> 01:20:22,409
Have a good day.

905
01:21:22,859 --> 01:21:24,048
Mr. Wylie!

906
01:21:25,160 --> 01:21:27,325
Richard. Please say Richard.

907
01:21:29,924 --> 01:21:31,524
Richard...

908
01:21:35,288 --> 01:21:36,879
I'm not ready.

909
01:21:38,690 --> 01:21:40,896
I would never be with...

910
01:21:40,931 --> 01:21:42,268
You would never what?

911
01:21:45,730 --> 01:21:47,906
I would never be with a man again.

912
01:21:50,080 --> 01:21:51,113
Because...

913
01:21:52,286 --> 01:21:53,874
I lost a man.

914
01:21:55,732 --> 01:21:57,524
- Lost?
- Yes.

915
01:22:00,178 --> 01:22:01,345
I'm a widow.

916
01:22:06,423 --> 01:22:07,423
A widow?

917
01:22:08,140 --> 01:22:10,230
Yes! No, no...

918
01:22:13,431 --> 01:22:14,846
Sort of.

919
01:22:21,850 --> 01:22:25,839
- What a clumsy fool I've been.
- No, it's...

920
01:22:28,650 --> 01:22:30,097
Will you forgive me?

921
01:22:31,653 --> 01:22:32,967
Of course.

922
01:22:42,044 --> 01:22:43,278
Well...

923
01:23:16,440 --> 01:23:18,150
What else do we need?

924
01:23:18,404 --> 01:23:22,698
Quinine, and antidote against scorpions.

925
01:23:24,220 --> 01:23:27,490
Scorpions, no. We'll be watchful.

926
01:23:27,920 --> 01:23:30,667
No Bedouin has ever been stung,
am I right?

927
01:23:31,440 --> 01:23:33,747
Yes, ma'am. As you wish.

928
01:23:34,430 --> 01:23:36,315
This market has everything we need.

929
01:23:36,316 --> 01:23:40,226
Mosquito net, a folding bed,
a bathtub.

930
01:23:40,261 --> 01:23:41,261
We need this.

931
01:23:42,124 --> 01:23:43,621
The lady has a good eye.

932
01:23:43,656 --> 01:23:45,444
I assure you they are the best.

933
01:24:14,823 --> 01:24:17,380
- I have confession to make.
- A confession?

934
01:24:17,500 --> 01:24:18,520
Yes.

935
01:24:20,726 --> 01:24:22,216
As wonderful as the horse was,

936
01:24:22,217 --> 01:24:25,374
it'd never have made it
in the dunes of the desert.

937
01:24:25,409 --> 01:24:26,671
What did you do?

938
01:24:27,713 --> 01:24:30,839
I traded it.
Fattuh traded it in the market place.

939
01:24:31,909 --> 01:24:37,151
For four of the very best dromedaries.
There they are.

940
01:24:37,152 --> 01:24:38,518
I'm sorry.

941
01:24:39,440 --> 01:24:42,350
Gertrude, don't leave. Not now.

942
01:24:43,571 --> 01:24:44,967
Richard, I have no choice.

943
01:24:48,310 --> 01:24:50,698
My heart is not ready.

944
01:24:52,739 --> 01:24:53,950
I can feel that.

945
01:24:56,230 --> 01:24:59,484
- Stay for just a few more weeks.
- No, it's late December.

946
01:24:59,930 --> 01:25:02,381
Very soon,
the dessert won't be possible.

947
01:25:06,287 --> 01:25:09,539
- I'm longing for you.
- Please do not say that.

948
01:25:09,574 --> 01:25:11,905
Do not say these things.

949
01:25:17,130 --> 01:25:20,646
- It'll all be lonely without you.
- You have a wife.

950
01:25:21,410 --> 01:25:25,016
It is the most unbearable loneliness
to be married unhappily.

951
01:25:25,051 --> 01:25:28,951
This comes at me
from nowhere, Richard.

952
01:25:29,640 --> 01:25:32,952
Besides, I could never fully be yours.
You're a married man.

953
01:25:36,019 --> 01:25:37,172
I'll settle everything.

954
01:25:41,529 --> 01:25:42,612
Will you write to me?

955
01:25:47,237 --> 01:25:50,988
I'll write you
from every post office in the desert.

956
01:25:56,170 --> 01:25:58,072
I'll keep a diary for you.

957
01:26:04,779 --> 01:26:06,960
The wind...

958
01:26:08,089 --> 01:26:09,369
What?

959
01:26:09,370 --> 01:26:10,370
The wind is coming with sand.

960
01:28:59,800 --> 01:29:01,565
Can the lady show me how to do it?

961
01:29:02,300 --> 01:29:03,604
To cook an egg?

962
01:29:03,860 --> 01:29:07,459
The desert knows no eggs.
The desert knows no hens.

963
01:29:08,540 --> 01:29:10,538
You boil it for 5 minutes.

964
01:29:10,573 --> 01:29:13,264
The desert knows no minutes.

965
01:29:14,580 --> 01:29:15,944
The length of a prayer.

966
01:29:16,683 --> 01:29:18,180
You have a present.

967
01:29:29,940 --> 01:29:31,010
<i>Richard...</i>

968
01:29:32,360 --> 01:29:34,919
<i>I'm trying
to keep you out of my thoughts,</i>

969
01:29:34,954 --> 01:29:37,079
<i>but it's strange.</i>

970
01:29:37,114 --> 01:29:40,191
<i>You are on my mind
in every step of the desert.</i>

971
01:29:41,020 --> 01:29:43,392
<i>My cook does not have
a notion of time.</i>

972
01:29:43,600 --> 01:29:46,110
<i>He's never boiled an egg.</i>

973
01:29:46,930 --> 01:29:51,060
<i>Already I've dropped back in the desert
as if it were my own place.</i>

974
01:29:53,054 --> 01:29:57,003
<i>Silence and solitude fowling around me
like an impenetrable veil.</i>

975
01:29:58,070 --> 01:30:01,700
<i>Sleep more profound
than civilization can thrive.</i>

976
01:30:01,730 --> 01:30:05,120
<i>And then the roadless desert.</i>

977
01:30:05,155 --> 01:30:06,157
<i>Again.</i>

978
01:30:14,878 --> 01:30:17,905
Before the tribal wars,
this place was alive.

979
01:30:18,620 --> 01:30:20,903
Now there are only ghosts here.

980
01:30:33,860 --> 01:30:35,215
What is this?

981
01:30:37,790 --> 01:30:39,206
How is this possible?

982
01:30:41,050 --> 01:30:42,916
Is it from the consul?

983
01:30:44,570 --> 01:30:48,131
The consul's messenger
must have been riding day and night.

984
01:30:50,887 --> 01:30:52,935
We shall stay here tonight.

985
01:30:58,342 --> 01:30:59,710
<i>My beloved,</i>

986
01:31:00,430 --> 01:31:04,922
<i>the desert has you
and my heart is with you.</i>

987
01:31:05,961 --> 01:31:08,803
<i>If I was free
and a very perfect night,</i>

988
01:31:09,251 --> 01:31:13,594
<i>it's be more fitting
to take you and kiss you.</i>

989
01:31:13,629 --> 01:31:17,282
<i>God seems to have joined us
for some divine moment.</i>

990
01:31:19,955 --> 01:31:21,209
<i>Ah, the ecstasy!</i>

991
01:31:23,582 --> 01:31:24,905
<i>We might reach it again,</i>

992
01:31:24,940 --> 01:31:27,434
<i>on an outpost of time.</i>

993
01:31:35,711 --> 01:31:39,019
<i>I can't sleep... I can't sleep.</i>

994
01:31:40,020 --> 01:31:41,132
<i>It is one in the morning.</i>

995
01:31:42,510 --> 01:31:47,202
<i>You and you and you
are between me and any rest.</i>

996
01:31:47,990 --> 01:31:50,534
<i>You once called me life.</i>

997
01:31:50,740 --> 01:31:55,583
<i>And fire. I flame and I'm consumed.</i>

998
01:31:56,504 --> 01:31:59,382
<i>There is a voice in me
I try to chase away. It says...</i>

999
01:31:59,383 --> 01:32:03,305
<i>"Before all other world,
claim me and take me."</i>

1000
01:32:06,026 --> 01:32:07,480
<i>And yet...</i>

1001
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:11,384
<i>Richard...</i>

1002
01:33:11,419 --> 01:33:15,735
<i>I doubt there is anyone in the world
so happy as I am now.</i>

1003
01:33:16,690 --> 01:33:19,095
<i>You were baptised in the desert</i>

1004
01:33:19,240 --> 01:33:21,632
<i>and there is
no another salvation for you.</i>

1005
01:33:24,620 --> 01:33:26,877
<i>When we are on the move, I feel</i>

1006
01:33:26,912 --> 01:33:30,095
<i>everything is behind us.</i>

1007
01:33:30,540 --> 01:33:33,072
<i>Only our shadows follow.</i>

1008
01:33:33,107 --> 01:33:35,018
<i>As if to remind us</i>

1009
01:33:35,963 --> 01:33:37,732
<i>of our past lives.</i>

1010
01:36:24,878 --> 01:36:28,752
The lady is bold,
as bold as any Bedouin man.

1011
01:36:29,930 --> 01:36:33,161
- Is your destination Hayri?
- It is.

1012
01:36:33,817 --> 01:36:36,119
I want to meet bin Rashid.

1013
01:36:38,660 --> 01:36:41,435
We have to talk a lot
about bin Rashid.

1014
01:36:41,470 --> 01:36:42,936
It has powerful enemies.

1015
01:36:42,980 --> 01:36:44,240
Ibn Saud?

1016
01:36:45,860 --> 01:36:47,728
Yes, and many others.

1017
01:36:47,763 --> 01:36:50,335
- You will not find him in Hayri.
- Where is he ?

1018
01:36:50,780 --> 01:36:52,502
He's at war in the South.

1019
01:36:54,260 --> 01:36:56,248
I thought he was at peace.

1020
01:36:56,283 --> 01:37:01,688
Not any longer. Beware of Hayri.
There is a lot of murdering going on.

1021
01:37:05,390 --> 01:37:07,158
- For me?
- Yes.

1022
01:37:34,290 --> 01:37:38,574
You've shown me
such gratuitous hospitality.

1023
01:37:39,030 --> 01:37:43,134
And you have entertained me
with wonderful desert stories.

1024
01:37:43,270 --> 01:37:45,592
Every Bedouin is a storyteller.

1025
01:37:47,710 --> 01:37:52,026
But you have also given insight
into the tribes and the tribes of Hayri.

1026
01:37:53,206 --> 01:37:56,343
And for that...
I want to thank you.

1027
01:37:57,298 --> 01:37:59,651
I would like to give you these.

1028
01:37:59,973 --> 01:38:01,908
These are my binoculars.

1029
01:38:03,273 --> 01:38:05,487
I can see clearly now,
so I do not need him.

1030
01:38:06,560 --> 01:38:07,390
These are a gift.

1031
01:38:09,127 --> 01:38:13,068
I've become a desert traveller
who is very rich.

1032
01:38:14,470 --> 01:38:15,659
Thank you.

1033
01:38:16,094 --> 01:38:19,068
And my guide, Ahmed,
will be your escort.

1034
01:38:19,320 --> 01:38:21,949
No harm will be done to you
on your way.

1035
01:38:21,984 --> 01:38:25,189
But once in Hayri, no one gets out.

1036
01:38:25,570 --> 01:38:30,184
Inshallah.
We want to see you again... alive.

1037
01:38:31,219 --> 01:38:32,440
Inshallah.

1038
01:38:35,397 --> 01:38:37,062
You can see very far.

1039
01:40:45,420 --> 01:40:49,007
Slaves, I don't know exactly
what this means.

1040
01:40:49,042 --> 01:40:51,039
But it's an insult, I'm sure.

1041
01:40:52,257 --> 01:40:53,277
Only the woman.

1042
01:40:53,860 --> 01:40:55,872
Men will stay behind.

1043
01:40:55,907 --> 01:40:58,415
Only the woman is invited here.

1044
01:41:27,650 --> 01:41:28,655
My name is Ibrahim.

1045
01:43:17,690 --> 01:43:19,902
I am Fatima, the aunt of the emir.

1046
01:43:20,280 --> 01:43:22,402
This is Turkia,
who will entertain you.

1047
01:43:22,480 --> 01:43:24,301
Welcome to Hayri.

1048
01:43:24,336 --> 01:43:25,965
You must be the Lady of the desert.

1049
01:43:26,110 --> 01:43:28,373
Rumour has been faster
than your camels.

1050
01:43:28,490 --> 01:43:30,185
I'm Gertrude Bell.

1051
01:43:32,460 --> 01:43:34,034
Who has sent you?

1052
01:43:34,330 --> 01:43:35,778
No one.

1053
01:43:37,000 --> 01:43:39,914
No, I'm here on my own.

1054
01:43:40,230 --> 01:43:41,516
On your own?

1055
01:43:43,260 --> 01:43:45,028
I know the world.

1056
01:43:45,430 --> 01:43:47,261
I come from Istanbul.

1057
01:43:47,964 --> 01:43:50,741
The Sultan has sent me as a gift
to Emir Rashid.

1058
01:43:51,380 --> 01:43:53,052
What are your plans?

1059
01:43:55,090 --> 01:43:57,941
I would like to meet Emir Rashid.

1060
01:44:24,960 --> 01:44:27,805
Emir Rashid has been driven off Hayri.

1061
01:44:28,310 --> 01:44:30,378
His women followed him.

1062
01:44:31,220 --> 01:44:33,754
And all tribe's men.

1063
01:44:33,789 --> 01:44:36,052
But he left me behind.

1064
01:44:37,180 --> 01:44:40,076
- He was a guest of the Emir?
- Yes.

1065
01:44:40,250 --> 01:44:42,207
The Emir Harrud, six years ago.

1066
01:44:42,940 --> 01:44:44,165
What happened?

1067
01:44:46,090 --> 01:44:48,772
This palace is full of conspiracies.

1068
01:44:48,807 --> 01:44:50,100
Full of murder.

1069
01:44:52,222 --> 01:44:53,849
What happened to the Emir?

1070
01:44:54,530 --> 01:44:56,080
He was assassinated.

1071
01:44:57,130 --> 01:45:00,574
And his successor was murdered.
And his successor as well.

1072
01:45:00,609 --> 01:45:02,318
All of them, a few years.

1073
01:45:05,730 --> 01:45:07,789
The Eunuchs were killed with them

1074
01:45:07,889 --> 01:45:11,921
and the entire harem was passed
from man to man to man.

1075
01:45:15,133 --> 01:45:16,824
Who is the ruling Emir now?

1076
01:45:16,859 --> 01:45:19,835
There was hardly anyone left
in his family.

1077
01:45:19,870 --> 01:45:21,855
So, he's young.

1078
01:45:21,890 --> 01:45:24,262
He's raiding in the North.

1079
01:45:24,297 --> 01:45:26,639
Fatima, his aunt,

1080
01:45:26,674 --> 01:45:30,412
is the true ruler.
She is the real Emir.

1081
01:45:40,091 --> 01:45:41,091
It's beautiful.

1082
01:45:51,250 --> 01:45:54,228
I have been a prisoner here
for three weeks now.

1083
01:45:55,410 --> 01:45:57,499
You are not a prisoner.

1084
01:45:58,030 --> 01:45:59,836
Your men are taken care well.

1085
01:46:00,362 --> 01:46:03,289
You are only required to stay
until the Emir decides.

1086
01:46:05,460 --> 01:46:06,862
Decides what?

1087
01:46:07,770 --> 01:46:09,531
If it would be good
to have you here.

1088
01:46:10,920 --> 01:46:12,116
For what?

1089
01:46:13,900 --> 01:46:18,036
My wish is to keep you here,
in the harem of the Emir.

1090
01:46:18,398 --> 01:46:20,048
He would be delighted.

1091
01:46:25,557 --> 01:46:26,795
Fatima...

1092
01:46:28,110 --> 01:46:29,794
That is not my wish.

1093
01:46:33,350 --> 01:46:34,688
When does he get back?

1094
01:46:37,820 --> 01:46:38,910
Do you know?

1095
01:48:07,970 --> 01:48:09,739
I am delighted to greet my guest.

1096
01:48:09,960 --> 01:48:13,249
He means:
"I am delighted to greet his wife

1097
01:48:13,284 --> 01:48:14,573
"into my harem."

1098
01:48:15,380 --> 01:48:16,829
Yes, my wife.

1099
01:48:20,950 --> 01:48:22,256
Emir...

1100
01:48:23,940 --> 01:48:25,607
It is an honour to meet you.

1101
01:48:26,543 --> 01:48:28,848
However, I am already married.

1102
01:48:29,570 --> 01:48:32,103
I am a member of the British Consul.

1103
01:48:33,200 --> 01:48:36,408
And this will cause a problem
both for a man and his country.

1104
01:48:37,830 --> 01:48:39,180
I was told otherwise.

1105
01:48:44,910 --> 01:48:47,188
"No man ever touches a married woman",

1106
01:48:50,870 --> 01:48:53,434
the Prophet, peace be upon him,
has taught us.

1107
01:49:55,750 --> 01:49:59,367
<i>Dear Richard,
it's clear from what I've seen</i>

1108
01:49:59,467 --> 01:50:02,035
<i>that the house of Rashid
is moving towards its demise.</i>

1109
01:50:03,920 --> 01:50:07,921
<i>It now appears that
Ibn Fold'star is in the ascendant.</i>

1110
01:50:08,260 --> 01:50:11,819
<i>And the future of Central Arabia
lies with him,</i>

1111
01:50:11,970 --> 01:50:14,450
<i>not the people of Hayri.</i>

1112
01:50:14,485 --> 01:50:17,850
<i>I should communicate this
to the British Arab Bureau.</i>

1113
01:50:23,872 --> 01:50:27,698
<i>The explorations that I have undertaken
these past years,</i>

1114
01:50:28,337 --> 01:50:31,939
<i>the terrains and its people
of tribal life and governments,</i>

1115
01:50:32,360 --> 01:50:37,083
<i>have culminated in a unique picture,
one that only I can paint.</i>

1116
01:50:52,699 --> 01:50:56,176
<i>As for myself, I sense that
long years of preparation,</i>

1117
01:50:57,100 --> 01:51:00,527
<i>preparation for what I do not know,
have ended.</i>

1118
01:51:01,410 --> 01:51:03,749
<i>And a new destiny</i>

1119
01:51:03,784 --> 01:51:05,213
<i>is unfolding before me.</i>

1120
01:51:10,550 --> 01:51:13,479
<i>I have only now to return to you.</i>

1121
01:51:47,454 --> 01:51:48,979
Let's find somewhere quiet.

1122
01:51:59,750 --> 01:52:02,191
I've read your diary.

1123
01:52:03,604 --> 01:52:05,955
It was meant for you.

1124
01:52:06,000 --> 01:52:07,920
The world is changing.

1125
01:52:11,024 --> 01:52:14,662
While I was in the desert,
the war turned into a World Wide War

1126
01:52:15,130 --> 01:52:17,187
and I didn't even notice.

1127
01:52:17,820 --> 01:52:19,491
All of Europe now.

1128
01:52:22,230 --> 01:52:23,874
Russia, Japan...

1129
01:52:27,611 --> 01:52:30,008
And America now.
They will have it too.

1130
01:52:35,052 --> 01:52:36,789
Gertrude, there's something
that I wanted to tell you.

1131
01:52:41,473 --> 01:52:43,359
I have re-enlisted for active service.

1132
01:52:54,488 --> 01:52:56,060
I expected it.

1133
01:52:58,650 --> 01:53:00,326
The moment I'm back from war,

1134
01:53:00,760 --> 01:53:02,845
I shall put everything in order
with Judith.

1135
01:53:05,030 --> 01:53:06,579
Thus should be free.

1136
01:53:09,880 --> 01:53:11,878
I'd rather put a bullet in my head...

1137
01:53:11,913 --> 01:53:13,219
than live without you.

1138
01:53:17,118 --> 01:53:18,641
Why do you say that?

1139
01:53:26,738 --> 01:53:28,579
Gertrude...

1140
01:53:30,550 --> 01:53:32,348
There is something you should know.

1141
01:53:34,498 --> 01:53:36,521
Judith has been making
ominous remarks about...

1142
01:53:39,003 --> 01:53:42,236
about committing suicide
if I should try to divorce her.

1143
01:53:43,848 --> 01:53:44,979
I see.

1144
01:53:45,280 --> 01:53:46,649
I do not believe it, but...

1145
01:53:53,422 --> 01:53:57,546
Love is a tyrant.

1146
01:54:33,140 --> 01:54:37,832
Gertie... Oriental secretary.
Congratulations.

1147
01:54:38,140 --> 01:54:40,623
It's as if they invented
the post foil.

1148
01:54:43,172 --> 01:54:46,009
- All this is your staff?
- It is.

1149
01:54:48,280 --> 01:54:51,222
You have become senior advisor,
Lawrence.

1150
01:54:52,297 --> 01:54:54,474
You've morphed into a political animal.

1151
01:54:55,187 --> 01:54:58,600
- Technically, I'm onto you, but...
- What?

1152
01:54:59,590 --> 01:55:02,925
There are no men like me
and no women like you, of course.

1153
01:55:02,926 --> 01:55:06,068
You've become some kind of queen.

1154
01:55:07,200 --> 01:55:11,140
No, just a woman
who misses her man.

1155
01:55:11,175 --> 01:55:13,316
You mean your officer
who joined the glorious war.

1156
01:55:15,685 --> 01:55:16,685
Yes, I do.

1157
01:55:21,083 --> 01:55:24,115
Miss Bell... could you get closer, please?
We'd like to get

1158
01:55:24,150 --> 01:55:25,739
- the Giza Pyramids in the frame.
- Mr Churchill!

1159
01:55:25,740 --> 01:55:27,874
Still, please.

1160
01:55:27,909 --> 01:55:31,572
Mr. Churchill, what are you expecting
from the conference?

1161
01:55:31,708 --> 01:55:33,644
Boys, let's face it...

1162
01:55:33,660 --> 01:55:35,546
a new order in the Arab World.

1163
01:55:35,581 --> 01:55:38,664
Mr. Churchill, with this new emphasis
on the Middle East,

1164
01:55:38,699 --> 01:55:41,230
where does that leave off policy
towards British India?

1165
01:55:42,780 --> 01:55:46,112
Churchill has tried to sell this
as a new achievement of the British Empire.

1166
01:55:47,120 --> 01:55:49,576
- What else is it?
- Come on, Lawrence.

1167
01:55:49,676 --> 01:55:51,262
We are not leading them
towards autonomy.

1168
01:55:51,263 --> 01:55:54,268
It's the Arab nations who are awakening.
This is their achievement.

1169
01:55:55,440 --> 01:55:56,572
Of course.

1170
01:56:00,450 --> 01:56:02,632
The Lions of the British Empire.

1171
01:56:03,720 --> 01:56:05,508
Mr Lawrence, over this way please.

1172
01:56:05,509 --> 01:56:07,956
The pyramids in the background,
for the photographers. Gentlemen...

1173
01:56:07,957 --> 01:56:10,506
You're having a shot.
A little to the left, sir.

1174
01:56:14,220 --> 01:56:15,399
Hold tight, Mr. Lawrence.

1175
01:56:15,400 --> 01:56:18,005
Gentlemen, are we getting this camp?
The shot is marvellous.

1176
01:56:20,400 --> 01:56:22,399
Mister Lawrence!

1177
01:56:25,400 --> 01:56:27,095
Marvellous. Boys,
are you getting this?

1178
01:56:27,096 --> 01:56:28,843
One more like that,
please, Mr. Churchill.

1179
01:56:30,210 --> 01:56:33,205
My cigar... my cigar went out.

1180
01:56:33,480 --> 01:56:35,559
That is the end of the world.

1181
01:56:35,980 --> 01:56:39,404
One more, Mr. Churchill.
You're all looking splendid.

1182
01:56:41,502 --> 01:56:43,287
4,000 years of history upon you.

1183
01:56:43,840 --> 01:56:45,577
Lawrence, shut up.

1184
01:56:45,760 --> 01:56:47,707
Napoleon said that before you.

1185
01:56:47,708 --> 01:56:50,409
Yes, all together now. Excellent!

1186
01:57:15,985 --> 01:57:17,955
Our losses at Gallipoli are staggering.

1187
01:57:17,955 --> 01:57:22,567
and the Australian expedition force
has lost 30,000 men in one single day.

1188
01:57:23,768 --> 01:57:25,515
General, this is classified.

1189
01:57:25,516 --> 01:57:29,401
I don't care. By tomorrow,
the whole world will shout of its window.

1190
01:57:29,411 --> 01:57:32,207
Doughty-Wylie ,
who led the assault,

1191
01:57:32,208 --> 01:57:34,444
has already been awarded
the Victoria Cross.

1192
01:57:35,472 --> 01:57:37,201
Did you said Richard?

1193
01:57:37,236 --> 01:57:39,125
Richard Doughty-Wylie ?

1194
01:57:39,540 --> 01:57:41,323
Royal Welch Fusiliers.

1195
01:57:41,324 --> 01:57:44,194
The Victoria Cross is only
for fallen heroes.

1196
01:57:44,616 --> 01:57:45,616
Correct.

1197
01:57:46,050 --> 01:57:49,438
We were told
he was seeking death in combat.

1198
01:57:49,473 --> 01:57:51,336
I think he has problems
with his wife.

1199
01:57:58,310 --> 01:57:59,380
Yes.

1200
01:58:29,967 --> 01:58:32,027
Excuse me. Thank you.

1201
01:58:51,346 --> 01:58:55,850
Fattuh,
what I'd do without you?

1202
01:58:58,110 --> 01:59:00,962
I shall follow the lady
to the end of the world.

1203
01:59:16,810 --> 01:59:18,237
<i>Dear diary...</i>

1204
01:59:18,740 --> 01:59:21,835
<i>in the afflictions of my heart,
I am turning to you.</i>

1205
01:59:23,499 --> 01:59:25,267
<i>It is as if my life is ended,</i>

1206
01:59:25,610 --> 01:59:27,350
<i>as if love was not meant for me.</i>

1207
01:59:29,040 --> 01:59:32,321
<i>And only the great task
I have shoulded keeps me going.</i>

1208
01:59:34,960 --> 01:59:38,089
<i>Cairo has became
one of the centres of the world again.</i>

1209
01:59:39,020 --> 01:59:40,917
<i>And I'm starting a new life.</i>

1210
01:59:42,395 --> 01:59:43,635
<i>The life of a politician.</i>

1211
01:59:47,290 --> 01:59:48,348
Gertrude...

1212
01:59:49,870 --> 01:59:52,252
Prince Faisal has requested
a meeting with you.

1213
01:59:53,060 --> 01:59:54,991
He seems to be everywhere.

1214
01:59:55,510 --> 01:59:58,848
How does the third son of Sharif Hussein
deal with his brothers?

1215
01:59:59,630 --> 02:00:03,044
His brothers are only interested
in horse racing.

1216
02:00:10,030 --> 02:00:12,836
Gertrude,
we have to play the game.

1217
02:00:13,900 --> 02:00:17,534
Faisal is shrewd,
he's cunning, he's ruthless.

1218
02:00:18,240 --> 02:00:20,929
But he seems to be the right one
for this time in history.

1219
02:00:21,810 --> 02:00:24,818
- Let's be sincere...
- It's dangerous to be sincere.

1220
02:00:24,830 --> 02:00:26,880
Unless you're also stupid.

1221
02:00:30,735 --> 02:00:34,129
England needs to get out its colonies
sooner rather than later.

1222
02:00:39,220 --> 02:00:42,451
I tremble for my country
when I reflect that God is just.

1223
02:01:17,200 --> 02:01:21,412
My brother Faisal and I have read
your memorandum on the Arab war.

1224
02:01:22,646 --> 02:01:23,709
Congratulations.

1225
02:01:23,744 --> 02:01:25,778
You do express our feelings.

1226
02:01:25,813 --> 02:01:29,549
No one in the Western world knows
the heart of a Bedouin better than you.

1227
02:01:30,390 --> 02:01:32,547
The Bedouins call you...

1228
02:01:32,582 --> 02:01:34,095
"the noble lady".

1229
02:01:36,890 --> 02:01:38,887
I am honoured.

1230
02:01:39,120 --> 02:01:42,250
And we agree with those who call you
"the mother of the faitful".

1231
02:01:42,285 --> 02:01:45,757
A title given to the wife of the Prophet,
peace upon him.

1232
02:01:46,860 --> 02:01:49,354
In the face of two direct descendants
of the Prophet

1233
02:01:49,389 --> 02:01:51,980
and in the face
of the people of the desert,

1234
02:01:53,120 --> 02:01:55,479
I am not worthy of that honour.

1235
02:01:59,799 --> 02:02:04,349
Your falcon's...
Your falcon's worthy of a king.

1236
02:02:07,100 --> 02:02:09,149
You will soon be king.

1237
02:02:12,160 --> 02:02:13,741
Over whom?

1238
02:02:17,190 --> 02:02:19,703
Over the people I love.

1239
02:02:23,280 --> 02:02:26,078
What makes an English woman
love us so much?

1240
02:02:32,010 --> 02:02:36,540
I have a trusted man, from Homs.

1241
02:02:37,770 --> 02:02:39,120
He is...

1242
02:02:41,040 --> 02:02:43,344
Well, he saved my life.

1243
02:02:43,379 --> 02:02:45,060
Many, many times in the desert.

1244
02:02:46,734 --> 02:02:49,172
He has an old mother
and when she speaks to him,

1245
02:02:49,272 --> 02:02:51,338
- she has five sons - she says...

1246
02:02:52,213 --> 02:02:53,477
Fattuh...

1247
02:02:54,280 --> 02:02:56,839
Fattuh, whom I entrust to bury me.

1248
02:02:58,840 --> 02:03:00,712
And then she speaks of the weather,

1249
02:03:00,747 --> 02:03:01,970
she speaks of the God and...

1250
02:03:03,898 --> 02:03:06,438
and for that alone... for him...

1251
02:03:09,106 --> 02:03:11,656
you will always have my heart.

1252
02:03:14,365 --> 02:03:17,663
And now, with your permission,
I will leave.

1253
02:03:20,060 --> 02:03:21,324
Go in peace.

1254
02:03:36,650 --> 02:03:38,693
How could she know
that we will be kings?

1255
02:03:40,728 --> 02:03:42,528
She is the maker of kings.

1256
02:03:44,460 --> 02:03:47,375
She is the crowned queen of the desert.
