NICHOLAS CULL: Every film
is a product of its time.

12
00:04:08,523 --> 00:04:11,192
And every successful
film tells you something

13
00:04:11,292 --> 00:04:13,027
about the time it was made.

14
00:04:13,127 --> 00:04:15,063
It's successful
because it resonates

15
00:04:15,163 --> 00:04:20,234
with stories and images
that people need to see

16
00:04:20,334 --> 00:04:22,736
at that particular point.

17
00:04:22,837 --> 00:04:24,238
HENRY JENKINS: "Alien"
is a radical break

18
00:04:24,338 --> 00:04:25,873
with science fiction.

19
00:04:25,973 --> 00:04:28,176
This is not the
notion of the alien

20
00:04:28,276 --> 00:04:30,344
that we were building
toward in something

21
00:04:30,445 --> 00:04:32,313
like "Close Encounters."

22
00:04:32,413 --> 00:04:33,481
CLARKE WOLFE: "Star
Wars" comes out,

23
00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:36,583
we have a fun space adventure.

24
00:04:36,683 --> 00:04:40,720
And then "Alien" comes
out, and people embrace it.

25
00:04:40,822 --> 00:04:43,958
And then just a couple
of years later, "E.T."

26
00:04:44,058 --> 00:04:46,961
and John Carpenter's
"The Thing" come out,

27
00:04:47,061 --> 00:04:52,200
and audiences resoundingly
are like, no, thank you.

28
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:55,103
We want our aliens to
be nice and squishy

29
00:04:55,203 --> 00:04:56,471
and cool and eat candy.

30
00:04:56,571 --> 00:04:59,606
I think there's a special
status that comes to some films

31
00:04:59,706 --> 00:05:02,844
that lodge in the audience's
collective imagination,

32
00:05:02,944 --> 00:05:06,347
and I think "Alien" is
certainly one of those films.

33
00:05:06,447 --> 00:05:08,748
WILLIAM LINN: Tolkien talked
about the cauldron of stories,

34
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:10,251
and certainly,
"Alien" is an example

35
00:05:10,351 --> 00:05:13,787
of a story drawing from a
real global set of myths.

36
00:05:13,888 --> 00:05:15,957
If you look at a somatics
experiment, what you're going

37
00:05:16,057 --> 00:05:19,427
to see is sand that
vibrates in a shape,

38
00:05:19,527 --> 00:05:22,796
and the shape changes based
on the different vibrations.

39
00:05:22,897 --> 00:05:25,799
A myth is like something
that vibrated from something

40
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:27,802
deeper that you can't see.

41
00:05:27,902 --> 00:05:29,937
You see a major
curse in the form

42
00:05:30,037 --> 00:05:33,374
of the alien, who
is very much a fury,

43
00:05:33,474 --> 00:05:36,144
responding to an imbalance.

44
00:05:36,244 --> 00:05:38,346
We're looking at a
story where there

45
00:05:38,446 --> 00:05:42,782
is a piece of material
prop that is now completely

46
00:05:42,884 --> 00:05:45,353
alive in our imaginations.

47
00:05:45,453 --> 00:05:46,753
It lives in our dreams.

48
00:05:46,854 --> 00:05:48,456
It lives in our
cultural conversation.

49
00:05:48,556 --> 00:05:50,724
It's one of the biggest
cultural dreams we've ever had.

50
00:05:57,198 --> 00:05:59,666
[gentle music]

51
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:03,237
DIANE O'BANNON:
I met Dan at USC.

52
00:06:03,337 --> 00:06:04,738
He was a real standout.

53
00:06:04,839 --> 00:06:06,174
You couldn't miss him.

54
00:06:06,274 --> 00:06:10,845
He was a wild man, unbounded
by conventional reality.

55
00:06:10,945 --> 00:06:14,681
You couldn't call him an
iconoclast, because he

56
00:06:14,781 --> 00:06:17,351
didn't have icons to break.

57
00:06:17,451 --> 00:06:19,620
He could be very offensive,
and was frequently

58
00:06:19,719 --> 00:06:21,788
offensive on purpose.

59
00:06:21,889 --> 00:06:25,426
He was hot, you know,
emotionally hot, emotionally

60
00:06:25,526 --> 00:06:29,197
responsive, very angry.

61
00:06:29,297 --> 00:06:33,434
He was born and raised in rural
Missouri and had no television.

62
00:06:33,534 --> 00:06:36,770
They didn't even have a
telephone till he was 10.

63
00:06:36,871 --> 00:06:39,941
They lived in the middle
of nowhere on 24 acres.

64
00:06:40,041 --> 00:06:41,708
And yet he knew
all these things.

65
00:06:41,809 --> 00:06:43,344
They didn't even have
a library in the town.

66
00:06:43,444 --> 00:06:47,048
His mother used to send
off for boxes of books,

67
00:06:47,148 --> 00:06:48,950
and they would come,
and he would read them,

68
00:06:49,050 --> 00:06:50,551
and then they'd send them back.

69
00:06:50,651 --> 00:06:52,954
Dan was always sneaking
science fiction.

70
00:06:53,054 --> 00:06:56,790
His mother always wanted
him to read good literature.

71
00:06:56,891 --> 00:06:58,326
And his mother would
always say, you

72
00:06:58,426 --> 00:07:00,528
haven't got any of that science
fiction in your backpack,

73
00:07:00,628 --> 00:07:01,929
have you?

74
00:07:02,029 --> 00:07:04,932
You're not taking that
science fiction to school.

75
00:07:05,032 --> 00:07:09,270
His father owned a curio
shop, it was called Odd Acres.

76
00:07:09,370 --> 00:07:11,572
There was a sort of screwy
Louie room, you know,

77
00:07:11,672 --> 00:07:13,674
where things were
sort of off kilter,

78
00:07:13,773 --> 00:07:16,743
and everything looks
like it's leaning.

79
00:07:16,844 --> 00:07:21,015
That was growing
up in Odd Acres.

80
00:07:21,115 --> 00:07:24,051
One time his father
faked a UFO landing.

81
00:07:27,455 --> 00:07:30,258
And Dan helped him, and then
he had the press out there,

82
00:07:30,358 --> 00:07:31,492
you know?

83
00:07:31,592 --> 00:07:33,594
By direction of the
President of the United States,

84
00:07:33,694 --> 00:07:34,761
stay in your homes.

85
00:07:34,862 --> 00:07:37,298
I repeat, stay in your homes.

86
00:07:37,398 --> 00:07:40,868
REPORTER: Because in one moment
of history-making violence,

87
00:07:40,968 --> 00:07:44,739
nature, mad, rampant, roared
its most awesome creation.

88
00:07:44,839 --> 00:07:46,374
DIANE O'BANNON: There's
a lot of bugs there.

89
00:07:46,474 --> 00:07:50,578
And he was always very
frightened, in a way,

90
00:07:50,678 --> 00:07:53,814
by the sudden
appearance of bugs,

91
00:07:53,914 --> 00:07:59,220
like a stick insect and
cicadas, massive invasions

92
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:02,523
in southern Missouri, they
would have hundreds of thousands

93
00:08:02,623 --> 00:08:05,293
of them come out of the ground
and swarm over everything

94
00:08:05,393 --> 00:08:06,861
and then vanish and die.

95
00:08:06,961 --> 00:08:10,364
So these things really
gave him the creeps.

96
00:08:10,464 --> 00:08:14,435
And he wanted to creep
everybody else out too.

97
00:08:14,535 --> 00:08:16,704
But he was quite an artist.

98
00:08:16,804 --> 00:08:19,106
And when he was thinking
of his monsters,

99
00:08:19,206 --> 00:08:22,376
he would sketch them out.

100
00:08:22,476 --> 00:08:25,713
Before "Alien," Dan had
written a screenplay called

101
00:08:25,813 --> 00:08:27,548
"They Bite."

102
00:08:27,648 --> 00:08:29,950
It was "Alien" before "Alien."

103
00:08:30,051 --> 00:08:32,920
And it involved a
cicada-like creature,

104
00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:35,956
but instead of being
13 years underground,

105
00:08:36,057 --> 00:08:39,427
it was several million
years underground,

106
00:08:39,527 --> 00:08:42,697
and gradually picks off the
people in the encampment one

107
00:08:42,797 --> 00:08:44,031
by one.

108
00:08:44,131 --> 00:08:46,767
It's a version of
an alien creature

109
00:08:46,867 --> 00:08:50,905
evolving, needing an
evolution, and being

110
00:08:51,005 --> 00:08:52,940
destructive in that evolution.

111
00:08:55,309 --> 00:08:58,045
O'Bannon has this
great line, says,

112
00:08:58,145 --> 00:08:59,714
"I didn't steal from anybody.

113
00:08:59,815 --> 00:09:01,048
I stole from everybody."

114
00:09:01,148 --> 00:09:04,085
And one of the places
that he happily

115
00:09:04,185 --> 00:09:08,622
admitted that he stole
from was a 1951 EC Comic

116
00:09:08,723 --> 00:09:10,124
called "Seeds of Jupiter."

117
00:09:10,224 --> 00:09:12,760
There's just eight pages.

118
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:14,528
It starts on an
aircraft carrier,

119
00:09:14,628 --> 00:09:18,933
and this orb crashes onto the
aircraft carrier, breaks apart,

120
00:09:19,033 --> 00:09:21,969
small orb, and it's
got like, 50 seeds.

121
00:09:22,069 --> 00:09:24,672
And there are three
Navy guys on the ship,

122
00:09:24,772 --> 00:09:28,175
and they're
wondering what it is.

123
00:09:28,275 --> 00:09:31,078
One of them's called Peach Pit,
and he likes to put peach pits

124
00:09:31,178 --> 00:09:32,480
in his mouth, and
the other two guys

125
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:35,549
sort of trick him into
putting one of these seeds

126
00:09:35,649 --> 00:09:37,118
into his mouth.

127
00:09:37,218 --> 00:09:38,686
And then they slap the guy on
the back, it's all good fun

128
00:09:38,786 --> 00:09:39,387
and he swallows.

129
00:09:42,123 --> 00:09:43,290
He gets terribly sick.

130
00:09:43,391 --> 00:09:43,991
He's dehydrated.

131
00:09:44,091 --> 00:09:45,259
It's emergency surgery.

132
00:09:45,359 --> 00:09:46,660
He's going die.

133
00:09:46,761 --> 00:09:48,496
The Navy surgeon
takes a scalpel,

134
00:09:48,596 --> 00:09:51,599
cuts open his chest,
[gasps] everybody shocked,

135
00:09:51,699 --> 00:09:57,438
and out pops this hideous,
scaly, disgusting mini octopus.

136
00:09:57,538 --> 00:10:00,574
And then it literally
scamper across the deck

137
00:10:00,674 --> 00:10:02,510
and plunges into the sea.

138
00:10:02,610 --> 00:10:06,147
And they go, well, we're
never going to see that again.

139
00:10:06,247 --> 00:10:08,884
Guaranteeing that they'll
be seeing that again.

140
00:10:08,983 --> 00:10:11,385
[ominous music]

141
00:10:12,653 --> 00:10:14,488
TIM BOXELL: The origin
of "Death Rattle" was

142
00:10:14,588 --> 00:10:18,392
in a farmhouse in Minnesota.

143
00:10:18,492 --> 00:10:22,430
The story itself is
some sort of astronaut

144
00:10:22,530 --> 00:10:24,198
coming across an object.

145
00:10:24,298 --> 00:10:27,735
It's the kind of statuary
that you might see in a temple

146
00:10:27,836 --> 00:10:31,005
in some ancient civilization.

147
00:10:31,105 --> 00:10:34,008
In the process of sending
it back, he drops it,

148
00:10:34,108 --> 00:10:36,010
he breaks it, and he
releases something

149
00:10:36,110 --> 00:10:41,215
that's about to change his
life in a very horrible way.

150
00:10:41,315 --> 00:10:44,652
He is attacked by this thing
that gets into his body.

151
00:10:44,752 --> 00:10:47,588
He is effectively raped.

152
00:10:47,688 --> 00:10:52,359
His eyes are gouged out and
something goes into his head.

153
00:10:52,460 --> 00:10:54,428
And from that point
on, he becomes

154
00:10:54,528 --> 00:10:58,399
a receptacle for something
that's taking him over.

155
00:10:58,499 --> 00:11:00,802
Something is
transforming a person

156
00:11:00,902 --> 00:11:03,137
into something very,
very different,

157
00:11:03,237 --> 00:11:05,372
very unfortunate, shall we say.

158
00:11:05,473 --> 00:11:07,741
[ominous music]

159
00:11:11,979 --> 00:11:15,683
As a healthy young kid growing
up in the Midwest in the 1950s

160
00:11:15,783 --> 00:11:18,352
and '60s, there were things
going on in the world

161
00:11:18,452 --> 00:11:20,588
that didn't quite make sense.

162
00:11:20,688 --> 00:11:22,958
Television was very
safe and cleaned up,

163
00:11:23,057 --> 00:11:25,259
so I clamored for
things that I wasn't

164
00:11:25,359 --> 00:11:29,129
getting from my civilization,
from my culture.

165
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:32,266
Dan O'Bannon drew
upon his experiences

166
00:11:32,366 --> 00:11:36,403
as a person from the Midwest,
reading comic books at the drug

167
00:11:36,504 --> 00:11:41,408
store, like I did, and brought
that kind of sensibility

168
00:11:41,509 --> 00:11:45,814
and that outlook on the
world to this major science

169
00:11:45,914 --> 00:11:48,782
fiction horror epic.

170
00:11:48,884 --> 00:11:53,687
The Midwest may seem tranquil
and civilized and so forth,

171
00:11:53,787 --> 00:11:55,756
but the fact is, you never
know who's next door.

172
00:11:55,857 --> 00:11:57,893
You never know who's going
to roll into town, you know,

173
00:11:57,993 --> 00:11:59,493
when the wheels are
going to come off.

174
00:12:01,830 --> 00:12:04,900
It's like we're all, you
know, one cough, one kiss,

175
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:09,403
one scratch away
from global disaster.

176
00:12:09,503 --> 00:12:11,772
[ominous music]

177
00:12:24,618 --> 00:12:27,154
DIANE O'BANNON: The
influence of Lovecraft on Dan

178
00:12:27,254 --> 00:12:29,089
was considerable.

179
00:12:29,189 --> 00:12:32,126
The eggs lying dormant
on the planetoid

180
00:12:32,226 --> 00:12:34,896
is comparable to
the cicada's million

181
00:12:34,996 --> 00:12:36,697
year life cycle, isn't it?

182
00:12:36,797 --> 00:12:38,532
Creatures coming out of
the ground after being

183
00:12:38,632 --> 00:12:42,136
dormant for millions
of years is superbly

184
00:12:42,236 --> 00:12:44,171
Lovecraftian, completely.

185
00:12:44,271 --> 00:12:47,809
I think that's a pretty
straight line between the two.

186
00:12:47,909 --> 00:12:49,878
ST JOSHI: Lovecraft,
in his own day,

187
00:12:49,978 --> 00:12:52,580
was a pioneer of
science fiction.

188
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:55,917
More specifically, his brand
of horror fiction, which he

189
00:12:56,017 --> 00:12:57,651
called weird fiction.

190
00:12:57,751 --> 00:13:01,288
He felt that the essence
of horror is the unknown,

191
00:13:01,388 --> 00:13:04,091
and what is most
unknown, it is what

192
00:13:04,191 --> 00:13:06,226
is out there in the
depths of space,

193
00:13:06,327 --> 00:13:09,663
and what has happened
in the far distant past.

194
00:13:09,763 --> 00:13:13,068
Many of the features
of "Alien" have a lot

195
00:13:13,167 --> 00:13:14,836
to do with Lovecraft's
short novel,

196
00:13:14,936 --> 00:13:16,570
"At the Mountains of Madness."

197
00:13:16,670 --> 00:13:18,873
This is a novel
he wrote in 1931.

198
00:13:18,974 --> 00:13:20,041
And it's something
that he'd wanted

199
00:13:20,140 --> 00:13:21,642
to write for a long
time, because he

200
00:13:21,742 --> 00:13:24,612
had been fascinated with the
Antarctic since he was a boy.

201
00:13:28,182 --> 00:13:30,852
An expedition from
Massachusetts goes down there,

202
00:13:30,952 --> 00:13:36,423
and come upon fossilized
remains of alien entities, which

203
00:13:36,523 --> 00:13:39,126
this expedition
labels The Old Ones.

204
00:13:39,226 --> 00:13:42,129
DALLAS: It's been
dead a long time.

205
00:13:42,229 --> 00:13:44,933
Fossilized.

206
00:13:45,033 --> 00:13:46,166
ST JOSHI: In the
course of this novel,

207
00:13:46,266 --> 00:13:49,004
they become unfrozen
and come to life.

208
00:13:49,104 --> 00:13:53,741
They cannot be defined by normal
human or terrestrial biology.

209
00:13:53,842 --> 00:13:55,977
I have confirmed that
he's got an outer layer

210
00:13:56,077 --> 00:13:59,613
of protein polysaccharides.

211
00:13:59,713 --> 00:14:01,682
Has funny habit of
shedding his cells

212
00:14:01,782 --> 00:14:06,320
and replacing them
with polarized silicon.

213
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:09,790
ST JOSHI: In fact, the
explorers find this immense city

214
00:14:09,891 --> 00:14:12,326
that The Old Ones built
hundreds of millions

215
00:14:12,426 --> 00:14:14,029
of years ago in
the Antarctic, full

216
00:14:14,129 --> 00:14:17,531
of very bizarre architecture.

217
00:14:17,631 --> 00:14:19,968
There are these
alien creatures that

218
00:14:20,068 --> 00:14:22,103
are virtually indestructible.

219
00:14:22,202 --> 00:14:24,139
They simply cannot die.

220
00:14:24,238 --> 00:14:26,407
RIPLEY: How do we kill it, Ash?

221
00:14:26,507 --> 00:14:27,942
There's gotta be a
way of killing it.

222
00:14:28,043 --> 00:14:28,709
How?

223
00:14:28,810 --> 00:14:30,711
How do we do it?

224
00:14:30,812 --> 00:14:32,246
You can't.

225
00:14:32,346 --> 00:14:34,248
Classical science
is based on the idea

226
00:14:34,348 --> 00:14:36,283
that matter is dead and inert.

227
00:14:36,383 --> 00:14:37,819
And this is true throughout
Western consciousness,

228
00:14:37,919 --> 00:14:39,854
from Prometheus and
Pandora to Adam and Eve.

229
00:14:39,954 --> 00:14:43,124
Space is empty and quiet.

230
00:14:43,223 --> 00:14:44,291
Is it?

231
00:14:44,391 --> 00:14:46,161
That's a perspective
that we have.

232
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:48,262
And I think "Alien" is
very much the nightmare

233
00:14:48,362 --> 00:14:49,831
to that perspective.

234
00:14:49,931 --> 00:14:53,101
And you see this in the
Coptic jars where they move.

235
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:55,636
And you see this when you get
out into the depths of space

236
00:14:55,736 --> 00:14:57,337
where it's supposed
to be quiet and dead,

237
00:14:57,438 --> 00:14:59,673
and instead, you
find the boogeyman.

238
00:14:59,773 --> 00:15:01,608
ST JOSHI: I cannot think of
a film out there that comes

239
00:15:01,709 --> 00:15:04,145
anywhere close to "Alien"
capturing that overall

240
00:15:04,244 --> 00:15:05,579
Lovecraftian atmosphere.

241
00:15:05,679 --> 00:15:08,315
That planetoid
where the ship lands

242
00:15:08,415 --> 00:15:10,551
is a prototypical
instance of what Lovecraft

243
00:15:10,651 --> 00:15:12,720
called the fear of the unknown.

244
00:15:12,821 --> 00:15:17,658
It is a place completely
uncharted by human expeditions.

245
00:15:17,758 --> 00:15:19,961
No big budget studio wanted
to put a lot of money

246
00:15:20,061 --> 00:15:21,996
into making a pure
Lovecraft film,

247
00:15:22,097 --> 00:15:25,466
and so people like O'Bannon
and John Carpenter and others

248
00:15:25,566 --> 00:15:27,434
had to sort of use
Lovecraftian elements

249
00:15:27,534 --> 00:15:30,604
covertly to infuse
Lovecraftian themes

250
00:15:30,704 --> 00:15:32,841
into works that
were not explicitly

251
00:15:32,941 --> 00:15:33,942
based on any of the stories.

252
00:15:36,677 --> 00:15:39,580
NICHOLAS CULL: "Alien" didn't
come out of a creative vacuum.

253
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:44,785
It drew on a whole heritage
of American science fiction.

254
00:15:44,886 --> 00:15:46,553
You could make the
argument that "Alien"

255
00:15:46,653 --> 00:15:49,958
certainly borrows from "It,
The Terror from Beyond Space"

256
00:15:50,058 --> 00:15:52,359
from 1958.

257
00:15:52,459 --> 00:15:56,965
A crew of 10 goes to Mars
to recover the lone survivor

258
00:15:57,065 --> 00:15:58,766
of a previous expedition.

259
00:15:58,867 --> 00:16:00,902
The rest of his crew
has been wiped out.

260
00:16:01,002 --> 00:16:03,570
EDWARD CAROTHERS (VOICEOVER):
Today, of all my crew,

261
00:16:03,670 --> 00:16:06,373
I, Colonel Edward Carothers
of the United States Space

262
00:16:06,473 --> 00:16:09,676
Command, am the only one alive.

263
00:16:09,777 --> 00:16:11,311
BEN MANKIEWICZ: They
obviously think he did it.

264
00:16:11,411 --> 00:16:13,047
He says, no, an alien did it.

265
00:16:13,148 --> 00:16:14,748
What are you thinking about?

266
00:16:14,849 --> 00:16:17,185
Those nine bodies
you left down there?

267
00:16:17,284 --> 00:16:19,453
Yes.

268
00:16:19,553 --> 00:16:22,190
But I didn't kill them.

269
00:16:22,289 --> 00:16:24,525
Spoiler, it was an alien.

270
00:16:24,625 --> 00:16:30,198
The alien stows away on
the ship and starts picking

271
00:16:30,297 --> 00:16:33,500
the crew off one by one.

272
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:36,171
It's hiding in the air ducts.

273
00:16:36,271 --> 00:16:38,338
Bullets, grenades,
nothing stops it.

274
00:16:38,438 --> 00:16:40,208
What do we do now?

275
00:16:40,307 --> 00:16:42,309
BEN MANKIEWICZ: And it's
killed by an air lock.

276
00:16:44,879 --> 00:16:47,447
NICHOLAS CULL: "The
Thing" from 1951

277
00:16:47,548 --> 00:16:49,783
is very present with the
idea of this creature

278
00:16:49,884 --> 00:16:52,586
that kind of
hatches, that mimics,

279
00:16:52,686 --> 00:16:56,757
that is in a
working environment.

280
00:16:56,858 --> 00:17:00,195
You can go to the 60s and look
at "Planet of the Vampires,"

281
00:17:00,295 --> 00:17:03,597
where they find this
giant alien corpse.

282
00:17:03,697 --> 00:17:05,599
Doesn't look like any
ship I've ever seen.

283
00:17:05,699 --> 00:17:07,969
Do you think it
belongs to the Orients?

284
00:17:08,069 --> 00:17:09,369
I doubt it.

285
00:17:09,469 --> 00:17:10,404
I doubt if the Orients
ever built any spaceships.

286
00:17:10,504 --> 00:17:11,572
- If they...
- [gasps]

287
00:17:11,672 --> 00:17:12,106
- ...we would have...
- Look, Mark.

288
00:17:16,610 --> 00:17:19,080
One of the films that "Alien"
draws quite heavily from

289
00:17:19,180 --> 00:17:24,319
is a 1966 film produced by Roger
Corman called "Queen of Blood."

290
00:17:24,418 --> 00:17:24,986
Listen.

291
00:17:30,024 --> 00:17:32,693
We've been picking up these
signals now for three days.

292
00:17:32,793 --> 00:17:36,097
NICHOLAS CULL: An alien distress
signal is received by Earth.

293
00:17:36,197 --> 00:17:39,600
Astronauts go out to find
the source of the signal.

294
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:41,602
They land on a planetoid.

295
00:17:41,702 --> 00:17:44,172
There's this strange sandstorm.

296
00:17:44,272 --> 00:17:46,274
They go into an alien vessel.

297
00:17:46,373 --> 00:17:49,576
They find a dead alien
sitting in a chair,

298
00:17:49,676 --> 00:17:52,847
encounter an alien who they're
bringing back to Earth,

299
00:17:52,947 --> 00:17:55,283
and the alien
begins individually

300
00:17:55,382 --> 00:17:58,785
attacking members of the crew.

301
00:17:58,887 --> 00:18:03,157
And at the end of the film, the
humans are left quite literally

302
00:18:03,258 --> 00:18:06,027
holding a tray of her eggs.

303
00:18:06,127 --> 00:18:10,298
Is this the beginning
of the end for humanity?

304
00:18:10,397 --> 00:18:12,699
[downbeat music]

305
00:18:14,002 --> 00:18:16,004
IAN NATHAN: John Carpenter
roped in Dan O'Bannon

306
00:18:16,104 --> 00:18:18,472
to helping him make the
student science fiction

307
00:18:18,572 --> 00:18:19,908
film called "Dark Star."

308
00:18:20,008 --> 00:18:22,509
And it was about the
crew of a spaceship...

309
00:18:22,609 --> 00:18:23,811
this might sound familiar...

310
00:18:23,912 --> 00:18:25,712
who then is assailed
by an alien who

311
00:18:25,813 --> 00:18:27,648
sort of stows away on the ship.

312
00:18:27,748 --> 00:18:29,317
DIANE O'BANNON:
"Dark Star," that's

313
00:18:29,416 --> 00:18:32,486
the comic version of "Alien."

314
00:18:32,586 --> 00:18:34,088
One makes you laugh,
and the other one's

315
00:18:34,188 --> 00:18:36,057
going to eat you alive.

316
00:18:36,157 --> 00:18:38,092
IAN NATHAN: Carpenter wanted
sole directing credit,

317
00:18:38,192 --> 00:18:41,495
and O'Bannon felt he'd done
enough to get cowriting credit.

318
00:18:41,595 --> 00:18:43,630
So they had this kind
of big falling out.

319
00:18:43,730 --> 00:18:46,034
And O'Bannon's first
thought is that, well,

320
00:18:46,134 --> 00:18:47,634
I can go and do this on my own.

321
00:18:47,734 --> 00:18:52,373
I will write a story,
a science fiction story

322
00:18:52,472 --> 00:18:53,774
that will beat "Dark Star."

323
00:18:53,875 --> 00:18:55,376
Wouldn't you consider
another course of action?

324
00:18:55,475 --> 00:18:58,545
For example, just waiting around
a while so we can disarm you?

325
00:18:58,645 --> 00:18:59,746
BOMB #20: No.

326
00:18:59,847 --> 00:19:00,949
Because I'm not
going to do a comedy,

327
00:19:01,049 --> 00:19:02,482
I'm going to do it
as a horror movie.

328
00:19:02,582 --> 00:19:05,119
COMPUTER: The ship will
automatically destruct

329
00:19:05,219 --> 00:19:10,325
in T-minus five minutes.

330
00:19:10,425 --> 00:19:13,593
You bitch!

331
00:19:13,694 --> 00:19:16,097
A lot of things bother
me about "Dark Star."

332
00:19:16,197 --> 00:19:20,467
We had an alien in it,
which was a beach ball.

333
00:19:20,567 --> 00:19:22,837
It was our second
try on that alien.

334
00:19:22,937 --> 00:19:27,008
I went away from "Dark
Star" really wanting to do

335
00:19:27,108 --> 00:19:29,043
an alien that looked real.

336
00:19:31,678 --> 00:19:33,314
[gentle music]

337
00:19:33,414 --> 00:19:36,717
DIANE O'BANNON: Jodorowsky saw
"Dark Star," which is how he

338
00:19:36,818 --> 00:19:39,153
found out about Dan O'Bannon.

339
00:19:39,253 --> 00:19:43,391
Nobody in Hollywood was
impressed with Jodorowsky.

340
00:19:43,490 --> 00:19:45,059
So he said, well,
to hell with you.

341
00:19:45,159 --> 00:19:50,497
So he found Dan and said,
come work on "Dune" with me.

342
00:19:50,597 --> 00:19:54,768
If you want to look
to the first magic,

343
00:19:54,869 --> 00:20:00,008
I think you have to
go back to Jodorowsky.

344
00:20:00,108 --> 00:20:01,541
Jodorowsky was his guru.

345
00:20:01,641 --> 00:20:02,910
He adored him.

346
00:20:03,011 --> 00:20:05,013
I've never met him
and I adore him.

347
00:20:05,113 --> 00:20:07,949
Not only is there a
synchronicity that connects

348
00:20:08,049 --> 00:20:11,685
"Dune" and "Alien," there's
almost an archetypal

349
00:20:11,785 --> 00:20:14,255
counterbalance between the two.

350
00:20:14,355 --> 00:20:18,092
If "Dune" is the Tower of
Babel, "Alien" is exactly what

351
00:20:18,192 --> 00:20:19,659
brings down that tower.

352
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:22,063
In the same way that "Alien"
is the response to Prometheus

353
00:20:22,163 --> 00:20:24,132
trying to steal fire
from the heavens,

354
00:20:24,232 --> 00:20:27,168
the movie "Alien" is also
a response, energetically,

355
00:20:27,268 --> 00:20:32,106
archetypally, to the Tower of
Babel project that was "Dune."

356
00:20:32,206 --> 00:20:34,976
DIANE O'BANNON: When
"Dune" collapsed in Paris,

357
00:20:35,076 --> 00:20:38,846
Dan came back and actually
crashed on the couch

358
00:20:38,946 --> 00:20:42,016
in the house I was living
in with a bunch of people

359
00:20:42,116 --> 00:20:43,550
because he didn't
have anywhere to go.

360
00:20:43,650 --> 00:20:45,386
And it... he...

361
00:20:45,486 --> 00:20:47,422
he was completely at a loss.

362
00:20:47,522 --> 00:20:51,459
Eventually, he... we
said, you got to go.

363
00:20:51,558 --> 00:20:55,129
So somehow, he wound up
on Ron Shusett's couch.

364
00:20:55,229 --> 00:20:59,100
I went back to storage, got
my typewriter out, took it over

365
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:02,736
to Ronnie Shusett's living room,
and over the days and nights

366
00:21:02,837 --> 00:21:06,340
of the next three
months, Ron keeping me

367
00:21:06,441 --> 00:21:08,376
alive by feeding me hot dogs.

368
00:21:08,476 --> 00:21:09,609
We were both starving.

369
00:21:09,709 --> 00:21:11,979
My wife was supporting us.

370
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:14,614
We had two rooms,
that's all we had.

371
00:21:14,714 --> 00:21:16,017
DIANE O'BANNON: He
made up a board game

372
00:21:16,117 --> 00:21:19,753
called Poverty, sort of
the opposite of Monopoly.

373
00:21:19,854 --> 00:21:22,789
You've got to land on enough
spaces to pay the rent.

374
00:21:22,890 --> 00:21:25,860
You're out on the street if
you can't afford to stay.

375
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:28,863
It's absolutely a scream.

376
00:21:28,963 --> 00:21:34,001
In 1971, Dan was working on
a story he called "Memory."

377
00:21:34,102 --> 00:21:38,072
It's basically the first
30 pages of "Alien."

378
00:21:38,172 --> 00:21:39,507
DAN O'BANNON: I
had this opening.

379
00:21:39,606 --> 00:21:41,109
I didn't know where
it was gonna go.

380
00:21:41,209 --> 00:21:44,312
I wanted to do a scary movie on
a spaceship with a small number

381
00:21:44,412 --> 00:21:45,712
of astronauts.

382
00:21:45,813 --> 00:21:48,216
They're receiving a signal
in an alien language.

383
00:21:48,316 --> 00:21:49,584
They go down to investigate.

384
00:21:49,683 --> 00:21:52,120
Their ship breaks down.

385
00:21:52,220 --> 00:21:53,588
DIANE O'BANNON: Dan
called it "Memory,"

386
00:21:53,687 --> 00:21:55,957
because some influence
in the planet

387
00:21:56,057 --> 00:21:59,659
gradually made them
lose their memory.

388
00:21:59,759 --> 00:22:01,129
But that's where
this story ends.

389
00:22:01,229 --> 00:22:03,264
[eerie music]

390
00:22:04,664 --> 00:22:06,134
RON SHUSETT: He
says, OK, I'm going

391
00:22:06,234 --> 00:22:09,170
to give you the first act I've
got to this original horror

392
00:22:09,270 --> 00:22:10,538
movie I wrote.

393
00:22:10,637 --> 00:22:12,772
I can't get past page 29.

394
00:22:12,874 --> 00:22:14,375
Maybe you can help me do that.

395
00:22:14,475 --> 00:22:15,977
So I read it.

396
00:22:16,077 --> 00:22:18,980
29 pages was almost exactly like
you saw in the final finished

397
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:20,680
product of the "Alien" movie.

398
00:22:20,780 --> 00:22:22,850
It was fantastic.

399
00:22:22,950 --> 00:22:25,953
Dan said, there's a
key to everything.

400
00:22:26,053 --> 00:22:29,290
The key is how does
the alien get on board?

401
00:22:29,390 --> 00:22:33,995
His concept was always it
would come out of your stomach.

402
00:22:34,095 --> 00:22:36,497
Dan had a very
bad case of Crohn's

403
00:22:36,597 --> 00:22:39,534
disease, which basically
appeared while he

404
00:22:39,634 --> 00:22:41,602
was filming "Dark Star."

405
00:22:41,701 --> 00:22:44,438
So he was, what, 24, 25?

406
00:22:44,539 --> 00:22:47,041
And it eventually killed him.

407
00:22:47,141 --> 00:22:50,378
But it was an
intestinal disorder

408
00:22:50,478 --> 00:22:53,581
that sometimes felt like it
was devouring him, I think.

409
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:55,016
Linda and I would
sometimes have to take him

410
00:22:55,116 --> 00:22:57,985
to the emergency center
in the middle of the night

411
00:22:58,085 --> 00:22:59,520
when the pain was so great.

412
00:22:59,620 --> 00:23:02,023
And at the same time, he'd
been having conversations

413
00:23:02,123 --> 00:23:06,561
with Ron Shusett about wasps
that procreate by planting

414
00:23:06,661 --> 00:23:09,096
that eggs into other insects.

415
00:23:09,197 --> 00:23:11,532
It was kind of all these things
sort of come together and were

416
00:23:11,632 --> 00:23:13,100
being sown into the script.

417
00:23:13,201 --> 00:23:15,336
Ron in a way was
really fascinated

418
00:23:15,436 --> 00:23:21,842
with the idea of human
beings being a host for...

419
00:23:21,943 --> 00:23:25,546
for an embryo, that
human beings were

420
00:23:25,646 --> 00:23:27,181
the nutrition for an embryo.

421
00:23:29,550 --> 00:23:31,352
RON SHUSETT: He didn't have
it in the script at all

422
00:23:31,452 --> 00:23:33,387
that it would implant
something in his stomach

423
00:23:33,487 --> 00:23:34,522
and it would grow there.

424
00:23:34,622 --> 00:23:36,123
So I went to sleep.

425
00:23:36,224 --> 00:23:38,725
And I'm aware... it
wasn't dreaming.

426
00:23:38,826 --> 00:23:40,061
It was something else.

427
00:23:40,161 --> 00:23:43,231
It was when your mind
is in the subconscious.

428
00:23:43,331 --> 00:23:46,067
I was wrestling with a
property in my sleep.

429
00:23:46,167 --> 00:23:48,135
I woke him up, I went right
into his studio and I said,

430
00:23:48,236 --> 00:23:48,703
I have it.

431
00:23:48,803 --> 00:23:49,470
I have it.

432
00:23:49,570 --> 00:23:50,338
He said, what?

433
00:23:50,438 --> 00:23:51,305
You have the answer?

434
00:23:51,405 --> 00:23:52,073
I said, I have the answer.

435
00:23:52,173 --> 00:23:52,640
The alien fucks.

436
00:23:52,739 --> 00:23:53,908
He said, what?

437
00:23:54,008 --> 00:23:55,443
What are you talking about?

438
00:23:55,543 --> 00:23:59,280
I said, jumps on his face,
it's a little creature then,

439
00:23:59,380 --> 00:24:03,317
little baby squid-like,
sticks a tube down his throat,

440
00:24:03,417 --> 00:24:06,786
starts feeding him air, but
he's implanting his seed.

441
00:24:06,887 --> 00:24:08,256
And it's going to
grow inside him

442
00:24:08,356 --> 00:24:10,524
and burst out of his chest
in the middle of the movie.

443
00:24:10,625 --> 00:24:13,094
[eerie music]

444
00:24:23,237 --> 00:24:24,739
CARL ZIMMER: There
are over a million

445
00:24:24,839 --> 00:24:27,375
species of parasitic wasps.

446
00:24:27,475 --> 00:24:31,512
That means that of all the
animals in the animal kingdom,

447
00:24:31,612 --> 00:24:36,450
the number one form of
animal is a parasitic wasp.

448
00:24:36,550 --> 00:24:43,224
There are wasps that like to
make caterpillars their host.

449
00:24:43,324 --> 00:24:46,694
They can also release
chemicals that control

450
00:24:46,793 --> 00:24:48,663
the behavior of their host.

451
00:24:48,763 --> 00:24:51,265
And everything it
eats is going to feed

452
00:24:51,365 --> 00:24:56,103
these larvae that are growing
inside of its body cavity.

453
00:24:56,203 --> 00:24:58,472
On the outside, they
look completely normal.

454
00:24:58,572 --> 00:25:03,577
So John Hurt having breakfast,
that's a caterpillar with

455
00:25:03,678 --> 00:25:05,246
wasps inside of it.

456
00:25:05,346 --> 00:25:08,449
And then once those
wasps are ready,

457
00:25:08,549 --> 00:25:11,052
they just blast their
way out of their host.

458
00:25:11,152 --> 00:25:13,754
And if that's lethal
to the host, fine.

459
00:25:13,888 --> 00:25:15,990
It doesn't matter.

460
00:25:16,090 --> 00:25:20,895
Ridley Scott liked to show film
footage of one species of wasp

461
00:25:20,995 --> 00:25:24,632
in particular to his crew,
and this is something

462
00:25:24,732 --> 00:25:26,133
known as the wood wasp.

463
00:25:26,233 --> 00:25:29,070
These wasps have to
basically find a way

464
00:25:29,170 --> 00:25:33,007
to stick their wasp bags
inside of beetle larvae that

465
00:25:33,107 --> 00:25:36,544
can be deep inside of wood.

466
00:25:36,644 --> 00:25:39,113
So there are all
these alien things

467
00:25:39,213 --> 00:25:41,082
that parasites are
doing all around us,

468
00:25:41,182 --> 00:25:44,118
and scientists are trying to
make sense of that in the way

469
00:25:44,218 --> 00:25:47,455
that the crew Nostromo was
trying to make sense of it

470
00:25:47,555 --> 00:25:49,390
with the alien.

471
00:25:49,490 --> 00:25:50,591
RIPLEY: That's amazing.

472
00:25:50,691 --> 00:25:53,427
What is it?

473
00:25:53,527 --> 00:25:54,729
Why, yes, it is.

474
00:25:54,830 --> 00:25:59,200
Um, I don't know yet.

475
00:25:59,300 --> 00:26:02,136
CARL ZIMMER: Getting
inside something else

476
00:26:02,236 --> 00:26:07,875
and feeding on it from
within is a really great way

477
00:26:07,975 --> 00:26:11,345
to survive and evolve.

478
00:26:11,445 --> 00:26:16,951
The alien is just fitting into
this fundamental basic pattern

479
00:26:17,051 --> 00:26:20,856
that you find on life, probably
the most successful way

480
00:26:20,955 --> 00:26:22,056
to be alive on Earth.

481
00:26:27,863 --> 00:26:30,297
[ominous music]

482
00:26:45,379 --> 00:26:48,149
Giger really came
from Dan O'Bannon.

483
00:26:48,249 --> 00:26:51,085
Dan suggested him on
a stroke of genius.

484
00:26:51,185 --> 00:26:53,287
Giger consolidates
every monster

485
00:26:53,387 --> 00:26:56,924
from every mythology around the
world into a single creature.

486
00:26:57,024 --> 00:26:58,659
He embodies the mythic other.

487
00:26:58,759 --> 00:27:00,161
DIANE O'BANNON:
Jodorowsky rescue

488
00:27:00,261 --> 00:27:02,963
went to an opening of some
of Giger's artwork in Paris

489
00:27:03,063 --> 00:27:05,366
and brought the book back.

490
00:27:05,466 --> 00:27:10,371
Dan looked at it and was just
knocked dead by the artwork.

491
00:27:10,471 --> 00:27:13,574
They were fantastic,
sexual, mechanical,

492
00:27:13,674 --> 00:27:18,479
biological amalgamation
that was completely new.

493
00:27:18,579 --> 00:27:21,081
RON SHUSETT: It does express
Giger's own admiration

494
00:27:21,182 --> 00:27:26,520
for Lovecraft as a pioneer
in envisioning creatures

495
00:27:26,620 --> 00:27:29,123
far beyond human conception.

496
00:27:29,223 --> 00:27:32,593
DIANE O'BANNON: I think Dan
and Giger met at the Lovecraft

497
00:27:32,693 --> 00:27:38,098
level, that sort of creeping
horror and unnamed horror

498
00:27:38,199 --> 00:27:42,470
that you are free
yourself to define.

499
00:27:42,570 --> 00:27:45,773
Dan and Giger both
had similar interests

500
00:27:45,874 --> 00:27:47,475
in the "Necronomicon."

501
00:27:47,575 --> 00:27:50,344
While Giger was doing
paintings on that theme,

502
00:27:50,444 --> 00:27:53,581
Dan was also writing his
version of the "Necronomicon,"

503
00:27:53,681 --> 00:27:54,582
which I still have.

504
00:27:54,682 --> 00:27:55,483
Its unpublished.

505
00:27:55,583 --> 00:27:58,719
It's a... a printed work.

506
00:27:58,820 --> 00:28:00,554
BIJAN AALAM: Giger was a mystic.

507
00:28:00,654 --> 00:28:04,525
He had his own mythology,
his own cosmology.

508
00:28:04,625 --> 00:28:07,829
He took like a bee
from different flowers

509
00:28:07,929 --> 00:28:14,735
to feed his own imagination
and make his own honey with it.

510
00:28:14,836 --> 00:28:18,105
He's the mythology
of the future.

511
00:28:18,205 --> 00:28:23,544
Of course, there is an
Egyptian touch to "Alien."

512
00:28:23,644 --> 00:28:27,214
Hans, his favorite
culture was Egypt.

513
00:28:27,314 --> 00:28:30,117
When he was five years old,
he went with his sister

514
00:28:30,217 --> 00:28:31,887
to the museum.

515
00:28:31,987 --> 00:28:33,621
In the cellar, there
was this mummy,

516
00:28:33,721 --> 00:28:38,392
an Egyptian mummy, and Hans,
he was quite afraid of it.

517
00:28:38,492 --> 00:28:40,896
He was so deeply impressed
by the black bones

518
00:28:40,996 --> 00:28:42,363
and the black skin.

519
00:28:42,463 --> 00:28:45,599
From then on, he went
almost every Sunday.

520
00:28:45,699 --> 00:28:50,337
He was absolutely
fascinated by the pyramids.

521
00:28:50,437 --> 00:28:51,840
WILLIAM LINN: In
early storyboards,

522
00:28:51,940 --> 00:28:55,543
you can actually see that
the derelict was a pyramid.

523
00:28:55,643 --> 00:28:59,113
And then later, Ridley
Scott envisions this kind

524
00:28:59,213 --> 00:29:03,117
of ritual area of ruins.

525
00:29:03,217 --> 00:29:05,653
This ship is an
emblem, is a remnant

526
00:29:05,753 --> 00:29:09,024
of a formerly great culture,
an ancient civilization

527
00:29:09,123 --> 00:29:11,559
that's been long lost to time.

528
00:29:11,659 --> 00:29:13,862
That tells us that we should
think of the spaceship,

529
00:29:13,962 --> 00:29:16,230
the derelict, as a temple.

530
00:29:16,330 --> 00:29:18,732
I think the derelict is a
crescent moon, and ultimately,

531
00:29:18,833 --> 00:29:21,268
a symbol of death.

532
00:29:21,368 --> 00:29:23,270
You see crescents all
throughout the story.

533
00:29:26,373 --> 00:29:29,143
In the original
screenplay, the pods

534
00:29:29,243 --> 00:29:33,314
were in a kind of pyramid
structure called the temple.

535
00:29:33,414 --> 00:29:37,986
That was removed because
of budget considerations

536
00:29:38,085 --> 00:29:40,688
in the production.

537
00:29:40,788 --> 00:29:43,390
CARMEN GIGER: Three stages
of the alien, you know,

538
00:29:43,490 --> 00:29:48,128
where the hole was put into a
pyramid, and on top of it all,

539
00:29:48,228 --> 00:29:51,432
is Nut, the Egyptian
goddess of the night

540
00:29:51,532 --> 00:29:54,501
sky with stars in her belly.

541
00:29:54,602 --> 00:29:57,771
And I think that was
really beautiful.

542
00:29:57,872 --> 00:30:01,709
WILLIAM LINN: You see being
born from her the heavens.

543
00:30:01,810 --> 00:30:04,445
And in many ways,
this becomes an image

544
00:30:04,545 --> 00:30:07,214
of the alien giving
birth to this species

545
00:30:07,314 --> 00:30:09,617
that could devour the heavens.

546
00:30:09,717 --> 00:30:14,990
Nut represents the duad
itself, the realm of the dead,

547
00:30:15,090 --> 00:30:17,558
the realm of night,
the realm of the stars.

548
00:30:17,658 --> 00:30:19,360
This is where the
Sun goes every night.

549
00:30:19,460 --> 00:30:22,363
This is where the soul goes
between life and death.

550
00:30:22,463 --> 00:30:25,100
We are in the aliens
domain in this whole story.

551
00:30:25,199 --> 00:30:27,601
[ominous music]

552
00:30:29,804 --> 00:30:34,141
The first I saw of the "Alien"
script was an early version.

553
00:30:34,241 --> 00:30:36,410
Dan O'Bannon brought it to me.

554
00:30:36,510 --> 00:30:41,049
And as I recall, the original
title was "Star Beast."

555
00:30:41,148 --> 00:30:46,654
I liked the script, and I wanted
to make it, but I said to Dan,

556
00:30:46,754 --> 00:30:49,991
this really requires
a bigger budget

557
00:30:50,091 --> 00:30:52,292
than what I'm able to spend.

558
00:30:52,393 --> 00:30:55,063
Why don't you shop
it around and see

559
00:30:55,162 --> 00:30:57,364
if you can get a big budget.

560
00:30:57,464 --> 00:31:01,301
If you can't get the big
budget, come back to me

561
00:31:01,402 --> 00:31:05,006
and I will buy the script
and make the picture.

562
00:31:05,106 --> 00:31:06,607
IAN NATHAN: And
a guy called Mark

563
00:31:06,707 --> 00:31:10,045
Hager got this script into the
pile at Walter Hill's office.

564
00:31:10,145 --> 00:31:13,781
And it must have been a day when
Walter Hill was at a loose end.

565
00:31:13,882 --> 00:31:15,817
He happened upon "Star Beast."

566
00:31:15,917 --> 00:31:17,718
Now, he thought "Star
beast" was one of the worst

567
00:31:17,819 --> 00:31:19,420
scripts he'd ever read.

568
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:21,022
He just thought it was awful.

569
00:31:21,122 --> 00:31:28,063
But he stopped, page whatever,
30, whatever it was, and went,

570
00:31:28,163 --> 00:31:29,530
what the hell?

571
00:31:29,630 --> 00:31:34,535
When Brandywine showed
interest and optioned "Alien,"

572
00:31:34,635 --> 00:31:38,539
Dan was, of course, being a
pest and insistent that they

573
00:31:38,639 --> 00:31:41,642
use Giger for the creature.

574
00:31:41,742 --> 00:31:49,450
This is the letter to Geiger
from Dan dated July 1, 1977.

575
00:31:49,550 --> 00:31:52,720
"Dear Giger, this week
I've moved into offices

576
00:31:52,821 --> 00:31:54,788
of Brandywine
Productions where we

577
00:31:54,889 --> 00:31:57,624
are beginning to make the
design decisions for our film.

578
00:31:57,725 --> 00:32:00,227
The producers, Gordon
Carroll and David Giler,

579
00:32:00,327 --> 00:32:02,262
and the director,
Walter Hill, are

580
00:32:02,362 --> 00:32:04,264
as excited as I am
about the possibilities

581
00:32:04,364 --> 00:32:07,668
of your lending your unique
talents to our picture.

582
00:32:07,768 --> 00:32:10,205
Look over the enclosed
description of the designs we

583
00:32:10,304 --> 00:32:12,439
need, then let us know
how much you would

584
00:32:12,539 --> 00:32:14,608
ask for the paintings involved.

585
00:32:14,708 --> 00:32:18,479
When we agree, we send you a
check for $1,000 as an advance

586
00:32:18,579 --> 00:32:20,882
against future payments.

587
00:32:20,982 --> 00:32:25,186
Yeah, well, Brandywine didn't
want to pay the $1,000,

588
00:32:25,285 --> 00:32:30,158
so Dan sent him a
personal check for $1,000.

589
00:32:30,257 --> 00:32:33,027
The face hugger,
that was my first thing

590
00:32:33,128 --> 00:32:35,596
I did for Dan O'Bannon.

591
00:32:35,696 --> 00:32:39,500
He gave me explanation
and drawings,

592
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:43,037
and he said that he's
jumping on a big egg,

593
00:32:43,138 --> 00:32:45,672
this egg is about that, so.

594
00:32:45,773 --> 00:32:48,943
And I thought that must be
quite a big monster, so I

595
00:32:49,043 --> 00:32:52,679
did an enormous facehugger.

596
00:32:52,780 --> 00:32:55,783
And then he was
jumping, I thought

597
00:32:55,884 --> 00:33:00,889
he could jump when his tail is
like, it's curved like a spring

598
00:33:00,989 --> 00:33:04,725
of the Jack in the box.

599
00:33:04,826 --> 00:33:06,261
DIANE O'BANNON: And
from those sketches,

600
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:08,462
he went ahead and
did the paintings.

601
00:33:08,562 --> 00:33:12,466
And that's why the paintings
say Dan O'Bannon's Alien,

602
00:33:12,566 --> 00:33:14,735
because Dan paid for them.

603
00:33:14,836 --> 00:33:18,106
Fox hierarchy come in to
see some of the designs,

604
00:33:18,206 --> 00:33:19,540
and they fired him.

605
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:21,910
Gordon Carroll finally
said, this guy is just sick.

606
00:33:22,010 --> 00:33:23,011
Get him off our lot.

607
00:33:23,111 --> 00:33:24,212
Send him back to Switzerland.

608
00:33:24,311 --> 00:33:25,980
We're having none of it.

609
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:27,816
So Giger was gone.

610
00:33:27,916 --> 00:33:30,819
Fox is full speed
ahead with Brandywine.

611
00:33:30,919 --> 00:33:32,821
They're in preproduction
Walter Hill is going to direct

612
00:33:32,921 --> 00:33:34,655
the film, and all of
a sudden, the studio

613
00:33:34,755 --> 00:33:37,424
gets a call from Walter Hill,
basically, where he says, yeah,

614
00:33:37,524 --> 00:33:38,492
I'm not going to...

615
00:33:38,592 --> 00:33:40,460
I'm not going to
make this movie.

616
00:33:40,561 --> 00:33:41,996
I never really believed in it.

617
00:33:42,096 --> 00:33:44,098
I don't think it's that great,
and I got another picture

618
00:33:44,199 --> 00:33:45,266
I'm going to do here.

619
00:33:45,365 --> 00:33:47,202
So good luck.

620
00:33:47,302 --> 00:33:48,535
I'm out.

621
00:33:48,635 --> 00:33:51,738
And that other picture
was "Southern Comfort."

622
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:53,174
Not a bad movie.

623
00:33:53,274 --> 00:33:54,508
Not "Alien."

624
00:33:54,608 --> 00:33:57,111
I read the script, and
I thought, well, this is

625
00:33:57,212 --> 00:34:00,447
very solid, very interesting.

626
00:34:00,547 --> 00:34:02,884
It's not really
an actor's script.

627
00:34:02,984 --> 00:34:05,253
There was no one else
attached, and they're

628
00:34:05,352 --> 00:34:09,723
asking me to get
involved in what was then

629
00:34:09,824 --> 00:34:13,393
a budgeted film for $2 million.

630
00:34:13,493 --> 00:34:17,564
$2 million sounds
like an Ed Wood movie.

631
00:34:17,664 --> 00:34:20,534
So I turned it down.

632
00:34:20,634 --> 00:34:24,738
Ridley and I had just
finished off the do list.

633
00:34:24,839 --> 00:34:26,440
There was this
thing between Ridley

634
00:34:26,540 --> 00:34:29,376
and I about sci-fi, and that
I was the sci-fi fanatic.

635
00:34:29,476 --> 00:34:31,645
And all the films that
I used to show him,

636
00:34:31,745 --> 00:34:35,515
he would completely
disparage and say,

637
00:34:35,616 --> 00:34:37,584
no, that's a pile of shit.

638
00:34:37,684 --> 00:34:39,921
He had the script through
the door called the "Alien,"

639
00:34:40,021 --> 00:34:42,522
and I tried to say, well,
let me read it, et cetera,

640
00:34:42,623 --> 00:34:44,926
and for some reason
or other, this time,

641
00:34:45,026 --> 00:34:48,196
he said, no, no, no,
no, I'll read it first.

642
00:34:48,296 --> 00:34:49,663
And so he was in
the next door office

643
00:34:49,763 --> 00:34:53,467
where we made commercials,
and I remember him

644
00:34:53,567 --> 00:34:56,804
sitting there going, fuck me.

645
00:34:56,905 --> 00:34:58,772
TOM SKERRITT: I got a
call a few weeks later,

646
00:34:58,873 --> 00:35:02,010
and they said, well, the
budget's up to $10 million,

647
00:35:02,110 --> 00:35:06,147
and a director named Ridley
Scott is going to direct it.

648
00:35:06,247 --> 00:35:08,283
I said, sold.

649
00:35:08,383 --> 00:35:10,852
I got a phone call
from Ridley saying,

650
00:35:10,952 --> 00:35:14,122
get your backside down
to Shepperton now.

651
00:35:14,222 --> 00:35:17,058
So I drove straight down there.

652
00:35:17,158 --> 00:35:21,461
DIANE O'BANNON: When Brandywine
brought Ridley on was when Dan

653
00:35:21,561 --> 00:35:24,198
really got an ally
in a lot of what

654
00:35:24,299 --> 00:35:27,668
he wanted for "Alien" to be.

655
00:35:27,768 --> 00:35:30,737
Very, very rare occurrence
when the writer can

656
00:35:30,838 --> 00:35:32,773
have that amount of influence.

657
00:35:32,874 --> 00:35:33,975
RON SHUSETT: We
thought he was gonna

658
00:35:34,075 --> 00:35:35,475
be the wrong director
for it, and he

659
00:35:35,575 --> 00:35:37,644
turned out to be the
greatest visual stylist

660
00:35:37,744 --> 00:35:39,380
since Kubrick's prime.

661
00:35:39,479 --> 00:35:40,915
IAN NATHAN: And he's
such a visual guy

662
00:35:41,015 --> 00:35:43,051
that the first thing he did
was kind of to break it down

663
00:35:43,151 --> 00:35:46,054
into storyboards, draws his
own storyboard, extraordinary

664
00:35:46,154 --> 00:35:48,089
artist, these fantastic images.

665
00:35:48,189 --> 00:35:51,558
But what it doesn't really have
is a clear idea of the alien.

666
00:35:51,658 --> 00:35:53,361
It's not quite there.

667
00:35:53,460 --> 00:35:55,762
O'Bannon says look,
I've got this book.

668
00:35:55,863 --> 00:35:57,332
DIANE O'BANNON: When
Dan showed Ridley

669
00:35:57,432 --> 00:36:00,467
the "Necronomicon,"
Ridley instantly said,

670
00:36:00,567 --> 00:36:02,469
yes, this is it.

671
00:36:02,569 --> 00:36:06,207
I was shown the book, Necro...

672
00:36:06,307 --> 00:36:07,774
WOMAN: Nomicom.

673
00:36:07,875 --> 00:36:11,611
"Necronomicon," OK, in Los
Angeles, in fact, by O'Bannon.

674
00:36:11,712 --> 00:36:12,713
He brought it in.

675
00:36:12,814 --> 00:36:14,581
And I nearly fell off the desk.

676
00:36:14,681 --> 00:36:16,616
Said, that's it.

677
00:36:16,717 --> 00:36:18,485
And why look further?

678
00:36:18,585 --> 00:36:20,121
And so that's how I saw it.

679
00:36:20,221 --> 00:36:21,655
It was as simple as that.

680
00:36:21,755 --> 00:36:24,791
I've never been so certain
about anything in my life.

681
00:36:24,892 --> 00:36:27,527
There were many
arguments at that stage.

682
00:36:27,627 --> 00:36:29,397
Fox were really quite troubled.

683
00:36:29,496 --> 00:36:34,335
But it was an early sign of how
strong Scott was on that film

684
00:36:34,435 --> 00:36:36,804
that he won so many battles.

685
00:36:36,904 --> 00:36:39,273
And the most fundamental
and important one

686
00:36:39,374 --> 00:36:42,276
was he got Giger back on.

687
00:36:42,377 --> 00:36:43,744
And I just thought
it was stunning,

688
00:36:43,845 --> 00:36:47,081
and I just stuck to
my guns saying, no.

689
00:36:47,181 --> 00:36:48,548
No, that's it.

690
00:36:48,648 --> 00:36:50,985
They said, let's bring him
in and talk some concepts.

691
00:36:51,085 --> 00:36:52,186
I said, no.

692
00:36:52,286 --> 00:36:53,087
You can't do that.

693
00:36:53,187 --> 00:36:54,288
That's it.

694
00:36:54,389 --> 00:36:55,857
We want to be
shooting by so and so.

695
00:36:55,957 --> 00:36:57,191
That's it.

696
00:36:57,291 --> 00:36:59,793
Just to get this right is
gonna be incredibly difficult.

697
00:36:59,894 --> 00:37:02,529
This is beautiful,
not just threatening.

698
00:37:02,629 --> 00:37:04,966
And also has very
sexual connotations.

699
00:37:05,066 --> 00:37:08,369
So in everything, it's
like a rather beautiful

700
00:37:08,469 --> 00:37:12,273
humanoid biomechanoid insect.

701
00:37:12,373 --> 00:37:15,009
Giger talks about
intentionally drawing imagery

702
00:37:15,109 --> 00:37:17,011
from his own dreams,
that means coming

703
00:37:17,111 --> 00:37:18,745
from a place where
he didn't have

704
00:37:18,846 --> 00:37:21,149
agency over what came to him.

705
00:37:21,249 --> 00:37:26,753
When he painted, he was
in this sort of trance.

706
00:37:26,854 --> 00:37:31,959
He was possessed, like
a seer, a blind seer.

707
00:37:32,060 --> 00:37:34,295
[hissing]

708
00:37:35,695 --> 00:37:40,068
Would go like that,
and like in a Polaroid,

709
00:37:40,168 --> 00:37:44,972
an image would appear
and take shape.

710
00:37:45,073 --> 00:37:48,242
DIANE O'BANNON: Giger's
images existed in a universe

711
00:37:48,342 --> 00:37:50,344
of their own in Switzerland.

712
00:37:50,445 --> 00:37:55,049
And they really found their
place in space, the xenomorph

713
00:37:55,149 --> 00:37:57,885
and the space jockey.

714
00:37:57,985 --> 00:38:01,355
Giger's images really
found a home in "Alien."

715
00:38:01,456 --> 00:38:03,424
Part of what you're seeing
with the character of "Alien"

716
00:38:03,524 --> 00:38:07,594
is this gorgeous synchrony,
this incredible synthesis

717
00:38:07,694 --> 00:38:10,064
of multiple
mythological characters,

718
00:38:10,164 --> 00:38:13,034
Sekhmet, Pazuzu, Kali.

719
00:38:13,134 --> 00:38:15,735
IAN NATHAN: You can see
the medieval dragon,

720
00:38:15,837 --> 00:38:21,175
the Renaissance demons, the
work of Heironymous Bosch.

721
00:38:21,275 --> 00:38:23,845
And it's a synthesis that
wasn't done consciously.

722
00:38:23,945 --> 00:38:26,514
It was a synthesis that happened
in the cauldron of stories

723
00:38:26,613 --> 00:38:28,983
that was Giger's imagination.

724
00:38:29,083 --> 00:38:31,651
This is a character with which
all three of these artists

725
00:38:31,751 --> 00:38:33,054
identified.

726
00:38:33,154 --> 00:38:34,788
And because they all
resonated with this pattern,

727
00:38:34,889 --> 00:38:36,824
they were drawn
together, this coming

728
00:38:36,924 --> 00:38:39,726
from a much deeper place.

729
00:38:39,827 --> 00:38:43,498
IAN NATHAN: Such a brilliant
choice that in the end,

730
00:38:43,598 --> 00:38:47,001
you could say separates "Alien"
from anything else was you've

731
00:38:47,101 --> 00:38:49,871
got this extraordinary
artist with this sort

732
00:38:49,971 --> 00:38:53,141
of mind-blowing imagery,
and you inject it

733
00:38:53,241 --> 00:38:54,175
straight into the film.

734
00:38:59,514 --> 00:39:02,517
NICHOLAS CULL: In the hands
of perhaps an aficionados who

735
00:39:02,617 --> 00:39:05,319
loved horror movies
and science fiction,

736
00:39:05,419 --> 00:39:08,956
it might have turned out to be
a completely different movie.

737
00:39:09,056 --> 00:39:10,657
DIANE O'BANNON:
The triptych of Dan

738
00:39:10,757 --> 00:39:13,793
O'Bannon, Ridley Scott,
and Hans Rudi Giger

739
00:39:13,895 --> 00:39:17,365
was the gift from the gods.

740
00:39:17,465 --> 00:39:18,566
They were on the
same wavelength.

741
00:39:18,665 --> 00:39:20,101
And they were all
thinking about this

742
00:39:20,201 --> 00:39:25,072
is more than a science fiction
adventure into the future.

743
00:39:25,173 --> 00:39:27,575
This was just as
much an exploration

744
00:39:27,674 --> 00:39:30,178
of the ancient past,
of the repressed

745
00:39:30,278 --> 00:39:33,713
and forgotten that
the alien represents.

746
00:39:33,814 --> 00:39:35,950
When a story comes
from multiple people,

747
00:39:36,050 --> 00:39:38,718
and beyond the agency
of multiple people,

748
00:39:38,819 --> 00:39:41,788
it has a special existence.

749
00:39:41,889 --> 00:39:42,957
ROGER CHRISTIAN:
It is a symbiosis.

750
00:39:43,057 --> 00:39:46,460
"Alien" is a symbiosis
of a few people

751
00:39:46,561 --> 00:39:48,229
who had that sensibility.

752
00:39:48,329 --> 00:39:50,598
If Dan had gone off
and been in charge,

753
00:39:50,697 --> 00:39:51,933
it would have been
a different film.

754
00:39:52,033 --> 00:39:54,268
It would have had more
of the "Dark Star."

755
00:39:54,368 --> 00:39:57,638
Ron Cobb would have been pure
sci-fi, all perfectly done,

756
00:39:57,737 --> 00:40:01,775
more Star Trekky in
a way, or "2001."

757
00:40:01,876 --> 00:40:06,681
I came on board and made
everything look grungy and real

758
00:40:06,780 --> 00:40:09,250
and like a space
truck, you know?

759
00:40:09,350 --> 00:40:12,119
"Alien", I would say
we got the sets right.

760
00:40:12,220 --> 00:40:14,589
The audience didn't
ever question

761
00:40:14,689 --> 00:40:17,458
that we just found
some old space craft

762
00:40:17,558 --> 00:40:19,994
and gone in and filmed in it.

763
00:40:20,094 --> 00:40:22,430
That was different to the
world that had gone before.

764
00:40:22,530 --> 00:40:26,100
There was "Robby the Robot,"
there was "Barbarella."

765
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:29,437
It's both very tangible, and
a completely different world

766
00:40:29,537 --> 00:40:30,770
at the same time.

767
00:40:30,871 --> 00:40:32,974
There's something almost
perennial about the way

768
00:40:33,074 --> 00:40:35,343
that yes, those ships are
a completely different

769
00:40:35,443 --> 00:40:37,744
environment from what
we're used to now

770
00:40:37,845 --> 00:40:40,648
and what we would have
seen 1,000 years ago,

771
00:40:40,747 --> 00:40:41,949
but human beings
haven't changed,

772
00:40:42,049 --> 00:40:44,318
and they still behave
in the same way.

773
00:40:44,418 --> 00:40:47,321
I place the hub of
the wheel at Ridley,

774
00:40:47,421 --> 00:40:51,192
because he's a visionary, and he
knew what to do with this film

775
00:40:51,292 --> 00:40:53,694
and how to marshal all
these different elements

776
00:40:53,793 --> 00:40:55,630
into "Alien."

777
00:40:55,730 --> 00:40:57,898
TOM SKERRITT: He was
running the camera,

778
00:40:57,999 --> 00:41:00,301
during a lot of the
lighting, everything

779
00:41:00,401 --> 00:41:02,436
was going on at
once, and he was just

780
00:41:02,536 --> 00:41:05,673
conducting it so splendidly.

781
00:41:05,772 --> 00:41:08,509
Ridley shot, yeah, a
good 80% of the film,

782
00:41:08,609 --> 00:41:09,910
and it was a panel
vision camera.

783
00:41:10,011 --> 00:41:11,245
I mean, these aren't light.

784
00:41:11,345 --> 00:41:15,349
He wanted... he wanted
anamorphic on purpose.

785
00:41:15,449 --> 00:41:18,953
We were contained in a space,
and that wide-angle lens

786
00:41:19,053 --> 00:41:22,156
made it seem much
more claustrophobic.

787
00:41:22,256 --> 00:41:24,158
The costume designer
who worked with Ridley

788
00:41:24,258 --> 00:41:25,626
said to me once,
you know, Ridley's

789
00:41:25,726 --> 00:41:28,095
got a camera for a head.

790
00:41:28,195 --> 00:41:33,868
He knows where to put
the camera automatically.

791
00:41:33,968 --> 00:41:36,737
When your hand-held, your
breathing with the actors,

792
00:41:36,837 --> 00:41:40,341
you're just part of
what you're filming.

793
00:41:40,441 --> 00:41:43,077
You're not distanced.

794
00:41:43,177 --> 00:41:47,782
I think that's one of the
best operated films ever seen.

795
00:41:47,882 --> 00:41:49,350
It's not wobbly cam.

796
00:41:49,450 --> 00:41:51,852
It was very beautifully
photographed.

797
00:41:57,291 --> 00:41:58,959
IAN NATHAN: There's a great
opening sequences where

798
00:41:59,060 --> 00:42:01,395
the camera drifts through
the empty Nostromo,

799
00:42:01,495 --> 00:42:06,100
and he had this wonderful
sense of movement in the frame.

800
00:42:06,200 --> 00:42:08,102
Even though they're all
in their cryo chambers,

801
00:42:08,202 --> 00:42:10,806
there's a strange sense
of life about the vessel.

802
00:42:10,905 --> 00:42:13,607
It's all kind of
presaging what's coming.

803
00:42:13,708 --> 00:42:17,178
But it's a haunted quality
that flutter in the frame.

804
00:42:17,278 --> 00:42:18,446
And he talks a
lot about the fact

805
00:42:18,546 --> 00:42:20,448
that he never let
the camera sit still,

806
00:42:20,548 --> 00:42:25,353
that it has to keep moving,
because you want the audience

807
00:42:25,453 --> 00:42:26,754
on edge the whole time.

808
00:42:26,854 --> 00:42:29,357
You never let the
film settle down.

809
00:42:29,457 --> 00:42:31,659
And even around the scenes
where they're kind of just

810
00:42:31,759 --> 00:42:34,095
having these kind of rather
sort of squabbling sequences

811
00:42:34,195 --> 00:42:38,032
between the crew, just
normal ship stuff,

812
00:42:38,132 --> 00:42:40,868
this there's slight air of
agitation about how he frames

813
00:42:40,968 --> 00:42:42,670
and how he moves the camera.

814
00:42:42,770 --> 00:42:44,138
He's getting [inaudible]
the heartbeat

815
00:42:44,238 --> 00:42:48,376
of the film, this kind of
growing throb that it has.

816
00:42:48,476 --> 00:42:52,279
ROGER CHRISTIAN: The reason
he wanted the ship in one path

817
00:42:52,380 --> 00:42:56,183
was he wanted to film like the
Mary Celeste at the opening.

818
00:42:56,283 --> 00:42:58,986
He was tracking around
the ship, and there

819
00:42:59,086 --> 00:43:00,921
were eerie little
things going on,

820
00:43:01,021 --> 00:43:03,224
the pecking birds that I
put in there for Ridley,

821
00:43:03,324 --> 00:43:05,459
and everyone said,
you can't do that.

822
00:43:05,559 --> 00:43:07,027
I thought it's a great idea.

823
00:43:07,128 --> 00:43:09,463
The annoying thing, yeah,
that was a Ridley realism,

824
00:43:09,563 --> 00:43:11,298
the little nodding... the
little nodding things.

825
00:43:11,399 --> 00:43:13,467
He had a thing about
that for whatever reason

826
00:43:13,567 --> 00:43:14,301
back from childhood.

827
00:43:14,402 --> 00:43:15,603
I loved it.

828
00:43:15,703 --> 00:43:17,304
ROGER CHRISTIAN: They were
in all the cars in England.

829
00:43:17,405 --> 00:43:19,006
Everyone had these blooming
things that were nodding.

830
00:43:19,106 --> 00:43:20,374
And they always was a joke.

831
00:43:20,474 --> 00:43:22,844
You know, America had
dice hanging and stuff,

832
00:43:22,943 --> 00:43:25,814
but England had
these nodding birds.

833
00:43:25,913 --> 00:43:27,548
It's perpetual motion.

834
00:43:27,648 --> 00:43:32,353
How do you illustrate that
this thing is just carrying on,

835
00:43:32,453 --> 00:43:35,656
and there's no
human beings on it?

836
00:43:35,756 --> 00:43:36,991
It just worked to me.

837
00:43:37,091 --> 00:43:40,027
And that quite kind of
going around the ship

838
00:43:40,127 --> 00:43:44,064
and the eeriness of
it, to me, said a lot.

839
00:43:44,165 --> 00:43:46,400
The little papers rustling.

840
00:43:46,500 --> 00:43:48,002
TERRY RAWLINGS:
It's all illogical.

841
00:43:48,102 --> 00:43:50,571
What would make these
pages flit around?

842
00:43:50,671 --> 00:43:51,639
Where's the wind coming from?

843
00:43:51,739 --> 00:43:52,640
All that stuff.

844
00:43:52,740 --> 00:43:53,774
IVOR POWELL: Yeah.

845
00:43:53,875 --> 00:43:56,210
It didn't make
sense, but it did.

846
00:43:56,310 --> 00:43:57,278
Yeah.

847
00:43:57,378 --> 00:43:58,946
You know, it was
like Ridley's vision.

848
00:43:59,046 --> 00:44:01,382
His eye prevails over...

849
00:44:01,482 --> 00:44:04,485
perhaps he'll forgive me
saying... the scientific logic

850
00:44:04,585 --> 00:44:07,688
of something, which is hence
why we had rain pissing

851
00:44:07,788 --> 00:44:10,758
down when Brett gets killed
in that sort of chain

852
00:44:10,859 --> 00:44:11,792
hanging room.

853
00:44:11,893 --> 00:44:13,394
And I had several discussions.

854
00:44:13,494 --> 00:44:15,864
Having worked on
"2001," where everything

855
00:44:15,963 --> 00:44:20,434
was meticulous and
real, but rain in space?

856
00:44:20,534 --> 00:44:22,736
You know, where...
where's it coming from?

857
00:44:22,838 --> 00:44:23,537
He said, I don't care.

858
00:44:23,637 --> 00:44:24,438
It looks great.

859
00:44:24,538 --> 00:44:25,206
TERRY RAWLINGS: It does.

860
00:44:25,306 --> 00:44:26,740
IVOR POWELL: That was it.

861
00:44:26,842 --> 00:44:28,944
A thing that we
got from Ben Burtt,

862
00:44:29,043 --> 00:44:32,948
we got this sort of
[vocalizing] that

863
00:44:33,047 --> 00:44:34,950
kept going throughout the film.

864
00:44:35,049 --> 00:44:38,118
[low-pitched humming]

865
00:44:40,387 --> 00:44:41,957
IVOR POWELL: It was
almost like a breathing,

866
00:44:42,056 --> 00:44:44,058
a sort of an alien
breath, breathing

867
00:44:44,158 --> 00:44:46,126
in, exhaling and inhaling.

868
00:44:46,227 --> 00:44:48,229
And I think it gave a
kind of, just a kind

869
00:44:48,329 --> 00:44:50,866
of feeling that something
was breathing down your neck

870
00:44:50,966 --> 00:44:52,233
all the time.

871
00:44:52,333 --> 00:44:54,502
Kind of gave you an
organic feel to the ship.

872
00:44:54,602 --> 00:44:56,972
[monitors beeping]

873
00:44:57,071 --> 00:44:58,506
ROGER CHRISTIAN: And
then the computer

874
00:44:58,606 --> 00:45:04,011
chatter that comes on in the
helmet, it makes you think,

875
00:45:04,111 --> 00:45:06,780
what's going on here?

876
00:45:06,882 --> 00:45:09,316
Everything that
Ridley built up was

877
00:45:09,416 --> 00:45:12,219
building on this
fear of the unknown,

878
00:45:12,319 --> 00:45:13,554
of something happening.

879
00:45:13,654 --> 00:45:16,457
Everybody's now waiting
for something to happen,

880
00:45:16,557 --> 00:45:17,424
but it doesn't.

881
00:45:17,525 --> 00:45:19,026
When I started
working on the film,

882
00:45:19,126 --> 00:45:20,594
I just realized that this...

883
00:45:20,694 --> 00:45:25,566
this film was going to be
virtually in slow motion.

884
00:45:25,666 --> 00:45:29,236
Everything was slow, except
for these stabs that you've

885
00:45:29,336 --> 00:45:31,539
got at various points.

886
00:45:31,639 --> 00:45:34,375
And you thought, how can
I sort of push someone

887
00:45:34,475 --> 00:45:37,378
into a corner from the
editing point of view,

888
00:45:37,478 --> 00:45:41,148
and how far do you go before the
audience says enough's enough?

889
00:45:41,248 --> 00:45:43,617
[downbeat music]

890
00:45:48,289 --> 00:45:49,523
IVOR POWELL: There
was a lot of, I think,

891
00:45:49,623 --> 00:45:52,293
studio concern about
the fact that it

892
00:45:52,393 --> 00:45:56,263
was 45 minutes before anything,
in their opinion, happened.

893
00:45:56,363 --> 00:45:59,166
Before the facehugger
jumps out of the egg and...

894
00:45:59,266 --> 00:46:03,004
and hits John Hurt on
the... on the old visage.

895
00:46:03,103 --> 00:46:04,471
But that was its strength.

896
00:46:04,572 --> 00:46:05,439
Indeed.

897
00:46:05,539 --> 00:46:07,141
That really was
its strength, to be

898
00:46:07,241 --> 00:46:09,911
able to hold it back
that long before you

899
00:46:10,011 --> 00:46:12,047
really gave it to the audience.

900
00:46:12,146 --> 00:46:15,282
They all found it very
hard to cope with that.

901
00:46:15,382 --> 00:46:17,351
IAN NATHAN: Dan O'Bannon had
conceptualized very early

902
00:46:17,451 --> 00:46:20,922
on in his script that they
wouldn't find the eggs

903
00:46:21,022 --> 00:46:22,991
in the derelict spacecraft.

904
00:46:23,123 --> 00:46:24,859
They would find
the space jockey.

905
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:27,361
[eerie music]

906
00:46:30,097 --> 00:46:31,765
Extraordinary vision,
and it came from Giger.

907
00:46:31,866 --> 00:46:34,501
It was a Giger picture.

908
00:46:34,602 --> 00:46:36,270
And it did something
brilliant in the sense

909
00:46:36,370 --> 00:46:39,975
that it showed you that the
universe was extraordinary.

910
00:46:40,075 --> 00:46:41,375
It was haunting.

911
00:46:41,475 --> 00:46:42,710
It was almost certainly benign.

912
00:46:42,811 --> 00:46:45,379
You felt almost sort of
a loss when you saw it.

913
00:46:45,479 --> 00:46:47,916
It was a kind of creature
ossified to a chair.

914
00:46:48,016 --> 00:46:50,651
You never quite understood what
was creature what was chair,

915
00:46:50,751 --> 00:46:52,419
and it was just brilliant.

916
00:46:52,519 --> 00:46:55,556
It's another thing that
Scott had to fight for.

917
00:46:55,656 --> 00:46:58,759
Because Fox just went, well, it
doesn't have any plot function,

918
00:46:58,860 --> 00:47:00,095
you know?

919
00:47:00,194 --> 00:47:02,262
They just go through the
floor and find the eggs.

920
00:47:02,363 --> 00:47:04,465
Ridley said, you can't just
have a hole in the ground.

921
00:47:04,565 --> 00:47:07,701
You've got to suggest something.

922
00:47:07,801 --> 00:47:09,603
In the chest of what
was then the space

923
00:47:09,703 --> 00:47:12,406
jockey, which we now know to be
the engineer, there's a hole.

924
00:47:12,506 --> 00:47:17,478
DALLAS: Bones are bent outward,
like he exploded from inside.

925
00:47:17,578 --> 00:47:20,347
So you get an instance
of what is a hint,

926
00:47:20,447 --> 00:47:25,552
a tiny little drop of maybe
what these... these things do.

927
00:47:25,653 --> 00:47:28,522
And they lower Kane
in on like, a wench.

928
00:47:28,622 --> 00:47:30,257
DALLAS: Can you see anything?

929
00:47:30,357 --> 00:47:32,827
KANE: I don't... a cave.

930
00:47:32,927 --> 00:47:35,295
A cave of some sort, but I...

931
00:47:38,099 --> 00:47:40,434
I don't know, but it's like
the goddamn tropics in here.

932
00:47:42,804 --> 00:47:45,840
IAN NATHAN: And he sees in
there this great sort of tableau

933
00:47:45,940 --> 00:47:48,009
that Giger had actually painted.

934
00:47:48,109 --> 00:47:52,814
When we got that onto that
set and saw what they had done,

935
00:47:52,914 --> 00:47:55,349
I mean, it was just...
it was mind-boggling.

936
00:47:55,449 --> 00:47:57,785
Everything was actual size.

937
00:47:57,886 --> 00:47:59,586
There was no CGI.

938
00:47:59,687 --> 00:48:03,424
So you were inside of
these big huge caverns

939
00:48:03,524 --> 00:48:05,492
that look like big
vaginas, you know?

940
00:48:05,592 --> 00:48:09,864
I mean, everything had a sort
of a very sexual orientation.

941
00:48:09,964 --> 00:48:11,732
IAN NATHAN: So you've
landed on the planet,

942
00:48:11,833 --> 00:48:14,268
and you've had this
ethereal sequence.

943
00:48:14,368 --> 00:48:17,304
Kane is almost guided
via the signal,

944
00:48:17,404 --> 00:48:19,373
some voice is
calling him onwards.

945
00:48:19,473 --> 00:48:20,842
And it's kind of wonderful
to think that there's

946
00:48:20,942 --> 00:48:23,644
something there, you know,
that the alien spacecraft

947
00:48:23,744 --> 00:48:25,312
is calling him.

948
00:48:25,412 --> 00:48:28,016
We get finally to the
belly of the derelict,

949
00:48:28,116 --> 00:48:30,350
and we get the egg chamber.

950
00:48:30,451 --> 00:48:32,319
That's the wake-up moment.

951
00:48:32,419 --> 00:48:34,823
[alien squealing]

952
00:48:36,290 --> 00:48:39,160
That whole tactic of the
beginning, the openness,

953
00:48:39,259 --> 00:48:41,395
and the kind of
hauntingness, suddenly, it

954
00:48:41,495 --> 00:48:43,697
gets sucked inward.

955
00:48:43,797 --> 00:48:45,332
Up until that
point, the film has

956
00:48:45,432 --> 00:48:48,702
been a kind of strange
hybrid between a Kubrickian

957
00:48:48,802 --> 00:48:51,940
serious science fiction
and this almost kind

958
00:48:52,040 --> 00:48:53,574
of fairy tale-like atmosphere.

959
00:48:53,674 --> 00:48:57,411
It's kind of strange
sort of hauntingness.

960
00:48:57,511 --> 00:49:00,681
It's not, strictly
speaking, entirely realistic

961
00:49:00,781 --> 00:49:03,417
up until the point
they have dinner.

962
00:49:03,517 --> 00:49:05,019
The chestburster
changes the complexion

963
00:49:05,120 --> 00:49:09,924
of the film from a kind of
epic to a kind of horribly,

964
00:49:10,024 --> 00:49:13,862
horribly intimate and sort
of claustrophobic and inward.

965
00:49:13,962 --> 00:49:15,964
It's kind of an inward movement,
even though the creature

966
00:49:16,064 --> 00:49:17,198
comes out of him.

967
00:49:17,297 --> 00:49:18,766
Suddenly, everybody's trapped.

968
00:49:18,867 --> 00:49:21,668
Suddenly, the spaceship is small
and confined, where before,

969
00:49:21,769 --> 00:49:24,038
it being this kind
of fast vessel.

970
00:49:24,139 --> 00:49:26,640
And what the film does is
make that hyper leap jump

971
00:49:26,740 --> 00:49:30,344
into a primal survival
story about many more things

972
00:49:30,444 --> 00:49:32,113
than we realize.

973
00:49:32,213 --> 00:49:35,382
Ridley always says
that this... this

974
00:49:35,482 --> 00:49:37,384
was the scene that
stood out that

975
00:49:37,484 --> 00:49:39,386
would make or break the film.

976
00:49:39,486 --> 00:49:44,259
It was just some craziness
that came out of Ron Shusett

977
00:49:44,358 --> 00:49:46,928
and Dan O'Bannon's mind.

978
00:49:47,028 --> 00:49:49,831
When you read it in the script,
there's so many different ways

979
00:49:49,931 --> 00:49:52,233
to approach it.

980
00:49:52,332 --> 00:49:56,670
And Ridley was so
constrained with the scene.

981
00:49:56,770 --> 00:49:59,406
It's a very significant
moment in film history.

982
00:49:59,506 --> 00:50:03,610
[gentle music]

983
00:50:03,710 --> 00:50:07,916
The idea came from a
painting from Francis Bacon.

984
00:50:08,016 --> 00:50:12,452
Ridley Scott told me that
this painting, it's just

985
00:50:12,553 --> 00:50:16,925
a crucification, and
one of the member

986
00:50:17,025 --> 00:50:24,598
has just teeth and red
flesh, and he liked to have

987
00:50:24,698 --> 00:50:26,433
the chestburster like that.

988
00:50:29,037 --> 00:50:30,939
FRANCIS BACON: I've
always been very moved

989
00:50:31,039 --> 00:50:34,175
by the movements of
the mouth and the shape

990
00:50:34,275 --> 00:50:35,844
of the mouth and the teeth.

991
00:50:35,944 --> 00:50:40,081
And I like the, you may
say, the glitter and color

992
00:50:40,181 --> 00:50:41,883
that comes from the mouth.

993
00:50:41,983 --> 00:50:46,620
When I was first went to Paris,
I found in an old bookshop

994
00:50:46,720 --> 00:50:48,689
a book on diseases of mouth.

995
00:50:48,789 --> 00:50:51,993
The plates were
hand-colored, and that it

996
00:50:52,093 --> 00:50:55,230
had a tremendous effect on me.

997
00:50:55,330 --> 00:50:56,496
MICHAEL PEPPIATT:
The three studies

998
00:50:56,597 --> 00:50:59,433
for figures at the
base of the crucifixion

999
00:50:59,533 --> 00:51:03,838
is the real point of
departure for Bacon.

1000
00:51:03,938 --> 00:51:09,543
He thought of that picture
as his first picture.

1001
00:51:09,643 --> 00:51:12,512
He was 35, and that's late,
of course, for an artist

1002
00:51:12,613 --> 00:51:15,749
to have a first work.

1003
00:51:15,850 --> 00:51:17,651
This is his breakthrough work.

1004
00:51:17,751 --> 00:51:21,990
And it's full of contradictions,
full of paradoxes.

1005
00:51:22,090 --> 00:51:25,726
How did suddenly this
enormously challenging,

1006
00:51:25,827 --> 00:51:31,698
unbelievably horrific
and ugly imagery arise?

1007
00:51:31,798 --> 00:51:34,601
The imagery is Christian.

1008
00:51:34,701 --> 00:51:41,876
And Bacon, even by then,
was a very violent atheist.

1009
00:51:41,976 --> 00:51:44,478
You get the crucifixion
in the title,

1010
00:51:44,578 --> 00:51:50,584
but it is a mixture of Greek
myths and Christianity.

1011
00:51:50,684 --> 00:51:54,322
The Greek influence
was very deep,

1012
00:51:54,421 --> 00:51:56,590
and I think he
thought of himself

1013
00:51:56,690 --> 00:51:59,559
as somebody hounded by furies.

1014
00:51:59,660 --> 00:52:03,530
And I think he felt their
talons in his flesh.

1015
00:52:03,630 --> 00:52:07,068
He said, oh, yes, the
furies visit me very often.

1016
00:52:12,506 --> 00:52:14,976
[ominous music]

1017
00:52:20,214 --> 00:52:22,582
DENISE DEMETRIOU: The
temple of Apollo at Delphi

1018
00:52:22,683 --> 00:52:26,687
was one of the major
sanctuaries of the Greek world.

1019
00:52:26,787 --> 00:52:31,326
It is really important in
the story of the furies.

1020
00:52:31,426 --> 00:52:34,028
The furies in
Greek mythology are

1021
00:52:34,128 --> 00:52:38,967
avengers of crimes, usually
committed by children

1022
00:52:39,067 --> 00:52:40,868
against their parents.

1023
00:52:40,969 --> 00:52:44,105
And they first appear
in Aeschylus' trilogy

1024
00:52:44,205 --> 00:52:47,541
when Orestes murders his
mother, Clytemnestra,

1025
00:52:47,641 --> 00:52:50,111
and her lover, Aegisthus.

1026
00:52:50,211 --> 00:52:53,982
When Orestes finds refuge at
the temple of Apollo at Delphi,

1027
00:52:54,082 --> 00:52:57,484
the ghost of Clytemnestra tries
to wake them up and rouse them

1028
00:52:57,584 --> 00:52:59,988
so that they can fulfill
their purpose, which

1029
00:53:00,088 --> 00:53:05,059
is to hound down
Orestes and take revenge

1030
00:53:05,159 --> 00:53:06,793
for Clytemnestra's murder.

1031
00:53:06,894 --> 00:53:10,530
The violence of the
[inaudible] brings up the...

1032
00:53:10,630 --> 00:53:12,799
the... the images.

1033
00:53:12,900 --> 00:53:14,969
I mean, if you remember
that wonderful translation

1034
00:53:15,069 --> 00:53:17,671
of one of his lines,
"the reek of human blood

1035
00:53:17,771 --> 00:53:19,073
smiles out at me."

1036
00:53:19,173 --> 00:53:21,142
Well, what could be
more amazing than that?

1037
00:53:21,242 --> 00:53:25,913
That immediately brings up
the most astonishing images.

1038
00:53:26,014 --> 00:53:29,017
WILLIAM LINN: The furies are
a common torment to a creator,

1039
00:53:29,117 --> 00:53:30,284
and here's why.

1040
00:53:30,385 --> 00:53:34,956
To create is inherently a
rebellion against creation.

1041
00:53:35,056 --> 00:53:37,657
MICHAEL PEPPIATT: The fact
that his father kicked him out

1042
00:53:37,758 --> 00:53:41,695
of the house when he discovered
he was homosexual was

1043
00:53:41,795 --> 00:53:45,665
a lasting wound in Bacon.

1044
00:53:45,766 --> 00:53:47,969
I think the furies,
to some extent,

1045
00:53:48,069 --> 00:53:50,972
are actually his
father, his father

1046
00:53:51,072 --> 00:53:55,309
pursuing him, chasing him
out of the family home

1047
00:53:55,410 --> 00:53:58,980
and branding him as an outsider.

1048
00:53:59,080 --> 00:54:04,785
This image came fully formed
out of Bacon's imagination.

1049
00:54:04,886 --> 00:54:10,858
It's like Athena springing fully
formed from the head of Zeus.

1050
00:54:10,958 --> 00:54:12,860
I see it as the monster
coming out of Bacon,

1051
00:54:12,960 --> 00:54:15,296
and the monster coming
out of the world.

1052
00:54:18,933 --> 00:54:21,735
Myths are thought to be
messages from the divine.

1053
00:54:21,836 --> 00:54:24,906
When Ridley Scott puts
this image of Bacon

1054
00:54:25,006 --> 00:54:28,543
into Giger's hands, that's
an odd synchronicity.

1055
00:54:28,642 --> 00:54:31,245
And when you see the
importance of the story,

1056
00:54:31,345 --> 00:54:34,282
and you're looking back on it
with the power and magnitude

1057
00:54:34,382 --> 00:54:37,518
with which that story landed,
all the synchronicities

1058
00:54:37,617 --> 00:54:39,420
that brought it to
that point seem all the

1059
00:54:39,520 --> 00:54:40,587
more important and stunning.

1060
00:54:40,687 --> 00:54:43,157
[eerie music]

1061
00:54:53,334 --> 00:54:57,205
It's crazy that these scenes
that are... a word I hate using,

1062
00:54:57,305 --> 00:54:58,873
but they are so iconic.

1063
00:54:58,973 --> 00:55:01,576
It seems like that
page should be...

1064
00:55:01,675 --> 00:55:02,844
you know, obviously,
there should be

1065
00:55:02,944 --> 00:55:04,946
like the Constitution, right?

1066
00:55:05,046 --> 00:55:07,482
I mean, at some point at the
end of "Citizen Kane," it says,

1067
00:55:07,582 --> 00:55:09,783
and the camera turns
and focuses and the...

1068
00:55:09,884 --> 00:55:11,219
it's a sled, Rosebud.

1069
00:55:11,319 --> 00:55:12,752
Fade to black.

1070
00:55:12,854 --> 00:55:15,189
It's not like, you know, you
know, you think and you go,

1071
00:55:15,289 --> 00:55:16,057
ta-da!

1072
00:55:16,157 --> 00:55:17,458
Right?

1073
00:55:17,558 --> 00:55:22,964
But the chest buster scene is
just a one-page description.

1074
00:55:23,064 --> 00:55:26,666
Broussard's face is screwed
up into a mask of agony,

1075
00:55:26,766 --> 00:55:29,904
and he's trembling
violently from head to foot.

1076
00:55:30,004 --> 00:55:34,475
There's an incoherent shriek
from Broussard, oh my god!

1077
00:55:34,575 --> 00:55:38,712
A red smear of blood blossoms on
the chest of Broussard's tunic.

1078
00:55:38,813 --> 00:55:41,182
Their eyes are all riveted
to Broussard's chest

1079
00:55:41,282 --> 00:55:43,451
as the fabric of his
tunic is ripped open,

1080
00:55:43,551 --> 00:55:47,989
and a horrible, nasty little
head the size of a man's fist

1081
00:55:48,089 --> 00:55:49,190
pushes out.

1082
00:55:49,290 --> 00:55:51,791
Everybody screams and
leaps back from the table.

1083
00:55:51,893 --> 00:55:54,095
The cat spits and bolts.

1084
00:55:54,195 --> 00:55:57,298
The disgusting little head
lunges, comes spurting out

1085
00:55:57,398 --> 00:56:00,734
of Broussard's chest, trailing
a thick worm-like tail,

1086
00:56:00,835 --> 00:56:02,937
splattering fluids and blood.

1087
00:56:03,037 --> 00:56:04,771
Lands in the middle
of the dishes

1088
00:56:04,872 --> 00:56:07,341
and food on the table and
screws away while the men

1089
00:56:07,441 --> 00:56:09,544
are stampeding for safe ground.

1090
00:56:09,644 --> 00:56:13,381
When they finally regain control
of themselves, it has escaped.

1091
00:56:13,481 --> 00:56:16,783
Broussard lies slumped
in his chair, a huge hole

1092
00:56:16,884 --> 00:56:19,153
in his chest spouting blood.

1093
00:56:19,253 --> 00:56:21,455
The dishes are scattered
and the food is

1094
00:56:21,556 --> 00:56:23,757
covered with blood and slime.

1095
00:56:26,627 --> 00:56:28,196
I'd make that movie.

1096
00:56:28,296 --> 00:56:29,430
Yeah.

1097
00:56:29,530 --> 00:56:31,032
The chestburster made
everything possible for us.

1098
00:56:31,132 --> 00:56:32,967
It wouldn't have
been the magic it was

1099
00:56:33,067 --> 00:56:34,936
without the chestburster scene.

1100
00:56:35,036 --> 00:56:37,338
Everything rested on that
scene from beginning to end,

1101
00:56:37,438 --> 00:56:39,974
from getting the film made,
to how the audience responds,

1102
00:56:40,074 --> 00:56:42,910
to whether those
monsters continue to live

1103
00:56:43,010 --> 00:56:44,744
in our imagination today.

1104
00:56:44,845 --> 00:56:46,614
It's that moment
we finally assert

1105
00:56:46,713 --> 00:56:48,748
that science fiction
isn't only about minds,

1106
00:56:48,849 --> 00:56:50,151
It's about our bodies.

1107
00:56:50,251 --> 00:56:51,919
It's continuous
with the directions

1108
00:56:52,019 --> 00:56:55,056
horror was taking over the
preceding decade, right?

1109
00:56:55,156 --> 00:56:57,058
Horror is moving
toward body horror,

1110
00:56:57,158 --> 00:57:00,494
through David Cronenberg
in particular.

1111
00:57:00,595 --> 00:57:02,463
It's part of the
texture of a film

1112
00:57:02,563 --> 00:57:06,167
that to me, is one of the
most tactile movies ever made.

1113
00:57:06,267 --> 00:57:09,136
The sense of goo
and grime, of things

1114
00:57:09,237 --> 00:57:14,208
spurting at us, the sense
of heat and steam and sweat.

1115
00:57:16,743 --> 00:57:20,747
There is a tendency to think
about the chestburster sequence

1116
00:57:20,848 --> 00:57:23,351
as a scene or even a moment.

1117
00:57:23,451 --> 00:57:26,420
But it really takes a
while to build up to it.

1118
00:57:26,520 --> 00:57:28,889
[gentle music]

1119
00:57:32,593 --> 00:57:35,663
The Nostromo moving in.

1120
00:57:35,762 --> 00:57:38,633
It's funny, isn't it,
how all these, you know,

1121
00:57:38,733 --> 00:57:41,969
outer space shots now have a
certain sort of like, you know,

1122
00:57:42,069 --> 00:57:43,571
generalization about them.

1123
00:57:43,671 --> 00:57:47,008
You know, when you think about
"2001," how gob-smacking that

1124
00:57:47,108 --> 00:57:50,378
was at the time, and now we just
take it completely for granted.

1125
00:57:50,478 --> 00:57:52,380
[ominous music]

1126
00:57:53,814 --> 00:57:56,050
MICHAEL PEPPIATT: Why is
it called the Nostromo?

1127
00:57:56,150 --> 00:57:58,919
The shuttle craft is
called the Narcissus.

1128
00:57:59,020 --> 00:58:02,490
Narcissus and Nostromo
are both words

1129
00:58:02,590 --> 00:58:07,528
that are used in book titles
by Joseph Conrad, who wrote

1130
00:58:07,628 --> 00:58:10,797
about the evils of imperialism.

1131
00:58:10,898 --> 00:58:13,301
By allusion to the
works of Conrad,

1132
00:58:13,401 --> 00:58:16,804
there's a strand within "Alien"
which is about a concern

1133
00:58:16,904 --> 00:58:19,607
as to what humanity
might find as it

1134
00:58:19,707 --> 00:58:23,210
ventures into the dark places.

1135
00:58:23,311 --> 00:58:25,146
In the case of
Conrad, he's thinking

1136
00:58:25,246 --> 00:58:31,118
about the heart of darkness,
the dark places of empire.

1137
00:58:31,218 --> 00:58:34,455
At the same moment that Ridley
Scott is making "Alien,"

1138
00:58:34,555 --> 00:58:38,292
you have Francis Ford Coppola
adapting "Heart of Darkness"

1139
00:58:38,392 --> 00:58:42,563
to be "Apocalypse Now,"
and explicitly commenting

1140
00:58:42,663 --> 00:58:45,366
on parallels between
the Vietnam War

1141
00:58:45,466 --> 00:58:50,404
and the encounter with evil in
the British and Belgian empire.

1142
00:58:50,504 --> 00:58:53,874
"Alien" directs our
attention or reminds us

1143
00:58:53,974 --> 00:58:58,579
of the dangers of
imperialism and conquest

1144
00:58:58,679 --> 00:59:01,048
of other places,
what we might find

1145
00:59:01,148 --> 00:59:04,485
in these uncharted regions,
especially if we attempt

1146
00:59:04,585 --> 00:59:06,087
to exploit those regions.

1147
00:59:06,187 --> 00:59:09,757
I hate to bring this up, but
this is a commercial ship, not

1148
00:59:09,857 --> 00:59:11,092
a rescue ship.

1149
00:59:11,192 --> 00:59:12,226
Right.

1150
00:59:12,326 --> 00:59:14,628
It's not in my contract
to do this kind of duty.

1151
00:59:14,729 --> 00:59:18,866
MICHAEL PEPPIATT: The 1970s was
a time of economic downturn,

1152
00:59:18,966 --> 00:59:22,403
of threat, threat
coming from new places.

1153
00:59:22,503 --> 00:59:24,806
Ash, can you see this?

1154
00:59:24,905 --> 00:59:25,539
Yes, I can.

1155
00:59:29,043 --> 00:59:30,578
I've never seen
anything like it.

1156
00:59:30,678 --> 00:59:31,679
MICHAEL PEPPIATT:
Particularly the

1157
00:59:31,779 --> 00:59:34,115
first stirrings of terrorism.

1158
00:59:34,215 --> 00:59:35,817
There were enemies within.

1159
00:59:35,916 --> 00:59:38,786
There was political corruption.

1160
00:59:38,886 --> 00:59:41,522
People had doubts,
were feeling isolated,

1161
00:59:41,622 --> 00:59:43,324
were feeling disillusioned.

1162
00:59:43,424 --> 00:59:46,026
I say that we
abandon this ship.

1163
00:59:46,127 --> 00:59:48,295
We get the shuttle and just
get the hell out of here.

1164
00:59:48,396 --> 00:59:51,432
We take our chances and
just hope that somebody...

1165
00:59:51,532 --> 00:59:52,133
Lambert.

1166
00:59:52,233 --> 00:59:53,634
LAMBERT: ...picks us up.

1167
00:59:53,734 --> 00:59:55,269
MICHAEL PEPPIATT: This is
a consequence of Watergate.

1168
00:59:55,369 --> 00:59:57,471
This is a consequence
of the Vietnam War.

1169
00:59:57,571 --> 01:00:01,175
This is a consequence of the
political corruption in Europe.

1170
01:00:01,275 --> 01:00:04,412
And I think that
that uncertainty

1171
01:00:04,512 --> 01:00:08,149
plays out in all kinds of
movies from that period.

1172
01:00:10,584 --> 01:00:14,588
DREW MORTON: If you look at '78,
you get Ted Bundy's captured,

1173
01:00:14,688 --> 01:00:17,958
John Wayne Gacy's captured, the
Hillside Strangler's out there.

1174
01:00:18,058 --> 01:00:19,693
So there's this kind
of new phenomenon

1175
01:00:19,794 --> 01:00:21,128
out there, right,
the serial killer,

1176
01:00:21,228 --> 01:00:22,864
and what does that mean?

1177
01:00:22,963 --> 01:00:24,198
There's this kind
of idea that there's

1178
01:00:24,298 --> 01:00:26,600
something out there that
can be completely evil

1179
01:00:26,700 --> 01:00:28,636
and illogical and horrible.

1180
01:00:28,736 --> 01:00:30,004
And there's no
reasoning with it,

1181
01:00:30,104 --> 01:00:32,908
and there's nothing you
can do to really stop it.

1182
01:00:33,007 --> 01:00:34,843
At no point in
the "Alien" movies,

1183
01:00:34,942 --> 01:00:36,110
and definitely not
in the first one,

1184
01:00:36,210 --> 01:00:38,979
do you feel like
what makes us human

1185
01:00:39,079 --> 01:00:41,315
is the thing that allows
us to beat this creature.

1186
01:00:41,415 --> 01:00:51,759
I admire its
purity, a survivor,

1187
01:00:51,860 --> 01:00:57,965
unclouded by
conscience, remorse,

1188
01:00:58,065 --> 01:00:59,868
or delusions of morality.

1189
01:00:59,967 --> 01:01:02,636
There is a commentary in there
about the way that things are

1190
01:01:02,736 --> 01:01:05,941
going right now, and about what
we're doing as human beings,

1191
01:01:06,040 --> 01:01:07,408
and how we're taking
those strengths,

1192
01:01:07,508 --> 01:01:10,110
and those emotions, those
things that make us human,

1193
01:01:10,211 --> 01:01:13,047
and we're turning
our backs on them.

1194
01:01:13,147 --> 01:01:15,483
MICHAEL PEPPIATT: You have
in these, in the 1970s,

1195
01:01:15,583 --> 01:01:18,519
tremendous fear over
what's happening

1196
01:01:18,619 --> 01:01:20,621
to the American family.

1197
01:01:20,721 --> 01:01:22,289
And I don't love you anymore.

1198
01:01:24,860 --> 01:01:25,493
Where you going?

1199
01:01:25,593 --> 01:01:27,495
I don't know.

1200
01:01:27,595 --> 01:01:30,097
MICHAEL PEPPIATT:
Panic about divorce,

1201
01:01:30,197 --> 01:01:33,300
panic about family breakdowns.

1202
01:01:33,400 --> 01:01:34,735
Here's what I
don't understand,

1203
01:01:34,836 --> 01:01:36,337
all the time... where are
you... where are you running?

1204
01:01:36,437 --> 01:01:37,973
All the times I come over
here, I can't understand

1205
01:01:38,072 --> 01:01:39,273
how you can prefer her to me.

1206
01:01:39,373 --> 01:01:40,241
You can't understand that?

1207
01:01:40,341 --> 01:01:41,609
No.
It's a mystery.

1208
01:01:41,709 --> 01:01:42,911
Well, you knew my history
when you married me.

1209
01:01:43,010 --> 01:01:44,044
Yeah.

1210
01:01:44,144 --> 01:01:45,246
MICHAEL PEPPIATT:
I think you can

1211
01:01:45,346 --> 01:01:47,581
see that the crew
of the space ship

1212
01:01:47,681 --> 01:01:50,551
operate like a kind
of family, and there

1213
01:01:50,651 --> 01:01:54,890
are sort of family-type
tensions between them.

1214
01:01:54,990 --> 01:01:57,091
Before we dock,
I think we oughta

1215
01:01:57,191 --> 01:01:58,492
discuss the bonus situation.

1216
01:01:58,592 --> 01:02:00,060
Right, right.
PARKER: We think we ought...

1217
01:02:00,160 --> 01:02:01,328
One of the things
that that strikes me

1218
01:02:01,428 --> 01:02:03,531
about this movie in
general is the way

1219
01:02:03,631 --> 01:02:07,134
that it's connecting what's
gonna happen with 80s movies

1220
01:02:07,234 --> 01:02:09,637
and what has happened
in 70s movies.

1221
01:02:09,737 --> 01:02:13,975
Because sonically, it feels
like a Robert Altman movie.

1222
01:02:14,074 --> 01:02:15,576
You have this scene of
all of these characters

1223
01:02:15,676 --> 01:02:19,280
sitting around talking before
they find out that Kane is OK.

1224
01:02:19,380 --> 01:02:21,315
How about a little something
to lower your spirits?

1225
01:02:21,415 --> 01:02:22,750
Thrill me, will you, please?

1226
01:02:22,851 --> 01:02:24,518
ADAM MORTIMER: The way that
it's blocked and staged,

1227
01:02:24,618 --> 01:02:27,788
five or six people in the frame
who are all doing something.

1228
01:02:27,889 --> 01:02:29,523
Just give me
the short version.

1229
01:02:29,623 --> 01:02:31,692
ADAM MORTIMER: People
talking on top of each other

1230
01:02:31,792 --> 01:02:35,964
at once at equal volumes, where
you have to sort of decide

1231
01:02:36,063 --> 01:02:37,832
who you want to
listen to, and they're

1232
01:02:37,933 --> 01:02:41,068
all mumbling and talking
extremely naturalistically.

1233
01:02:41,168 --> 01:02:43,103
[interposing voices]

1234
01:02:46,440 --> 01:02:48,475
It's doing the thing
that cinema in America

1235
01:02:48,576 --> 01:02:50,644
was doing in the 70s,
which was to try to point

1236
01:02:50,744 --> 01:02:54,950
the lens at a more
naturalistic working class

1237
01:02:55,050 --> 01:02:57,484
reality of America.

1238
01:02:57,585 --> 01:03:01,288
The future of blue
collar workers

1239
01:03:01,388 --> 01:03:05,326
is something that's
wholly revolutionary.

1240
01:03:05,426 --> 01:03:07,795
And the movie, in a
way, is about that.

1241
01:03:07,896 --> 01:03:11,231
It's about the exploitation
of these blue collar workers

1242
01:03:11,332 --> 01:03:13,267
by the corporation.

1243
01:03:13,367 --> 01:03:15,336
Hey, Ripley, I wanna
ask you a question.

1244
01:03:17,872 --> 01:03:19,473
If they find what they're
looking for out there,

1245
01:03:19,573 --> 01:03:21,108
does that mean we
get full shares?

1246
01:03:21,208 --> 01:03:22,376
Don't worry, Parker.

1247
01:03:22,476 --> 01:03:25,446
Yeah, you'll get
whatever's coming to you.

1248
01:03:25,546 --> 01:03:27,916
Look, I'm not gonna
do any more work till we

1249
01:03:28,016 --> 01:03:28,984
get this straightened out.

1250
01:03:29,084 --> 01:03:30,551
|

1251
01:03:30,651 --> 01:03:33,021
"Alien," to me, makes more
sense if it were made in 1974,

1252
01:03:33,120 --> 01:03:35,456
'75, '76 than after "Star Wars."

1253
01:03:35,556 --> 01:03:37,191
"Alien" is a smaller movie.

1254
01:03:37,291 --> 01:03:39,159
"Alien"... I can't
believe I'm saying this...

1255
01:03:39,259 --> 01:03:41,395
is a realistic movie.

1256
01:03:41,495 --> 01:03:42,831
HENRY JENKINS:
Part of it was just

1257
01:03:42,931 --> 01:03:46,500
getting away from that
sanitized view of space that

1258
01:03:46,600 --> 01:03:50,137
had dominated science
fiction from the 60s and much

1259
01:03:50,237 --> 01:03:53,140
of the 70s, and
coming to something

1260
01:03:53,240 --> 01:03:56,310
that felt like a real
lived-in environment.

1261
01:03:56,410 --> 01:03:58,113
It was continuous
with the world we

1262
01:03:58,212 --> 01:04:00,581
knew outside the movie theater.

1263
01:04:00,681 --> 01:04:01,850
ADAM MORTIMER:
Harry Dean Stanton

1264
01:04:01,950 --> 01:04:03,751
and Yaphet Kotto
are the two most

1265
01:04:03,852 --> 01:04:05,386
working class guys on the ship.

1266
01:04:05,486 --> 01:04:09,256
And they, unwittingly maybe,
but maybe intuitively,

1267
01:04:09,356 --> 01:04:12,060
know that if they
just freeze Kane,

1268
01:04:12,159 --> 01:04:14,963
everything's going to be OK.

1269
01:04:15,063 --> 01:04:18,066
How come they
don't freeze him?

1270
01:04:18,165 --> 01:04:20,467
How come you guys
don't freeze him?

1271
01:04:20,567 --> 01:04:22,169
What I think we should
do is just freeze him.

1272
01:04:22,269 --> 01:04:23,303
I mean, he's got a disease.

1273
01:04:23,404 --> 01:04:24,772
Why don't we stop
it where it is?

1274
01:04:24,873 --> 01:04:26,507
He can always get to a
doctor when we get back home.

1275
01:04:26,607 --> 01:04:27,741
Right.

1276
01:04:27,842 --> 01:04:30,945
They're speaking the
truth in this kind of almost

1277
01:04:31,046 --> 01:04:33,081
Greek chorus kind
of prophet way,

1278
01:04:33,180 --> 01:04:34,415
but nobody really wants
to listen to them,

1279
01:04:34,515 --> 01:04:36,517
and they're just
making fun of them.

1280
01:04:36,617 --> 01:04:38,452
Whenever he says
anything, you say

1281
01:04:38,552 --> 01:04:40,621
right, Brett, you know that?

1282
01:04:40,721 --> 01:04:41,588
Right.

1283
01:04:41,689 --> 01:04:43,357
What they're making
fun of them for

1284
01:04:43,457 --> 01:04:46,995
is that Harry Dean Stanton keeps
saying right, right, right,

1285
01:04:47,095 --> 01:04:48,963
but it's because they are right.

1286
01:04:49,064 --> 01:04:51,432
And in the staging
of this scene,

1287
01:04:51,532 --> 01:04:54,401
Dallas, the ship captain,
is sitting closest to us,

1288
01:04:54,501 --> 01:04:58,305
and there's this wall of the two
working class guys between him

1289
01:04:58,405 --> 01:05:01,810
and the two women, who are
scientists and flight officers.

1290
01:05:01,910 --> 01:05:03,845
And when he gets
frustrated with this sense

1291
01:05:03,945 --> 01:05:08,083
that, even jokingly, his
authority is being undermined

1292
01:05:08,183 --> 01:05:10,617
by these two guys,
who are his employees,

1293
01:05:10,718 --> 01:05:13,188
he crosses to the
far depth of the shot

1294
01:05:13,287 --> 01:05:15,756
to talk to Lambert,
who immediately

1295
01:05:15,857 --> 01:05:18,392
starts talking this sort
of elevated, educated way.

1296
01:05:18,492 --> 01:05:20,761
Well, according to my
calculations, based on time

1297
01:05:20,862 --> 01:05:22,529
spent getting to and
from the planet...

1298
01:05:22,629 --> 01:05:24,032
Just give me
the short version.

1299
01:05:24,132 --> 01:05:25,232
How far to Earth?

1300
01:05:25,332 --> 01:05:26,567
10 months.

1301
01:05:26,667 --> 01:05:27,969
ADAM MORTIMER: And you
can really see visually

1302
01:05:28,069 --> 01:05:30,537
in this incredibly subtle
way that there really

1303
01:05:30,637 --> 01:05:35,476
is this war about the movement
between the classes on the ship

1304
01:05:35,576 --> 01:05:38,980
and who has the
right to be heard.

1305
01:05:39,080 --> 01:05:40,781
Right.

1306
01:05:40,882 --> 01:05:44,451
MICHAEL PEPPIATT: We now know
that Hollywood in the 1970s

1307
01:05:44,551 --> 01:05:47,554
was a very oppressive
place for women.

1308
01:05:47,654 --> 01:05:49,256
Do you find, in
fact, that this, what

1309
01:05:49,356 --> 01:05:52,060
could be best described as
your equipment, in fact,

1310
01:05:52,160 --> 01:05:53,393
hinders you perhaps?

1311
01:05:53,494 --> 01:05:54,929
MICHAEL PEPPIATT: You
think about the sexism,

1312
01:05:55,029 --> 01:05:59,167
the misogyny that was implicit
within the industry that

1313
01:05:59,266 --> 01:06:00,135
made this film.

1314
01:06:00,235 --> 01:06:01,301
You mean my fingers?

1315
01:06:01,401 --> 01:06:02,904
[laughter]

1316
01:06:03,004 --> 01:06:04,271
No, I meant your...

1317
01:06:04,371 --> 01:06:06,808
[laughter]

1318
01:06:06,908 --> 01:06:07,775
Come on, spit it out.

1319
01:06:07,876 --> 01:06:08,709
I meant your...

1320
01:06:08,810 --> 01:06:09,811
your figure.

1321
01:06:09,911 --> 01:06:11,179
My figure?

1322
01:06:11,278 --> 01:06:13,313
MICHAEL PEPPIATT: And there's
no way of looking at "Alien"

1323
01:06:13,413 --> 01:06:18,418
without seeing it as a
male fantasy of the kind

1324
01:06:18,519 --> 01:06:21,555
of oppression that have been
being handed out to women

1325
01:06:21,655 --> 01:06:28,062
over the centuries, a guilt
that was part of masculinity

1326
01:06:28,163 --> 01:06:34,035
in the 1970s, and should
be part of masculinity now.

1327
01:06:34,135 --> 01:06:38,338
"Alien" has within it fantasies
of male pregnancy, fantasies

1328
01:06:38,438 --> 01:06:44,478
of male rape, fantasies
of male penetration.

1329
01:06:44,578 --> 01:06:49,050
And it's all tied up with that
amazing chest buster scene.

1330
01:06:49,150 --> 01:06:50,919
I don't know how
explicitly they

1331
01:06:51,019 --> 01:06:52,553
realized what they were doing.

1332
01:06:52,653 --> 01:06:54,388
I can't imagine that any
studio would be like,

1333
01:06:54,488 --> 01:06:56,891
yes, you're making a
male rape movie in space.

1334
01:06:56,991 --> 01:06:58,625
For sure, let's go for it.

1335
01:06:58,725 --> 01:07:00,394
It's wonderful that
the unconscious works

1336
01:07:00,494 --> 01:07:03,463
in so many mysterious ways.

1337
01:07:03,564 --> 01:07:06,034
It feels like a
summoning in a major way,

1338
01:07:06,134 --> 01:07:09,670
an accidental awakening
of some repressed spirit.

1339
01:07:09,770 --> 01:07:14,608
The furies certainly speak
for the repressed feminine.

1340
01:07:14,708 --> 01:07:18,545
And "Alien" certainly
represents the repressed

1341
01:07:18,645 --> 01:07:21,682
feminine's retribution.

1342
01:07:21,782 --> 01:07:25,352
"Alien" touched a nerve
with a lot of people

1343
01:07:25,452 --> 01:07:29,157
because it was talking
about something,

1344
01:07:29,257 --> 01:07:36,130
that even in 2019, we're still
not comfortable addressing.

1345
01:07:36,231 --> 01:07:42,303
The idea that
"Alien" is addressing

1346
01:07:42,402 --> 01:07:47,942
the guilt that a
patriarchal society feels

1347
01:07:48,042 --> 01:07:49,978
makes perfect sense to me.

1348
01:07:50,078 --> 01:07:51,545
We'll move in pairs.

1349
01:07:51,645 --> 01:07:54,648
We'll go step by step and cut
off every bulkhead and every

1350
01:07:54,748 --> 01:07:57,285
vent until we have it cornered,
and then we'll blow it

1351
01:07:57,384 --> 01:07:59,053
the fuck out into space.

1352
01:07:59,153 --> 01:08:01,622
Is that acceptable to you?

1353
01:08:01,722 --> 01:08:03,892
Ripley was created
in 1979, and it's

1354
01:08:03,992 --> 01:08:06,961
insane that we don't have that
many great female characters

1355
01:08:07,061 --> 01:08:08,196
since.

1356
01:08:08,296 --> 01:08:10,131
And especially in a
genre like horror,

1357
01:08:10,231 --> 01:08:14,568
that's given so many female
characters throughout time,

1358
01:08:14,668 --> 01:08:16,170
and yet, there's not
one that strikes us

1359
01:08:16,271 --> 01:08:20,275
as being as developed and as
complex and as interesting

1360
01:08:20,375 --> 01:08:21,475
as Ripley was.

1361
01:08:21,575 --> 01:08:23,710
And isn't it ironic
that she ends up

1362
01:08:23,811 --> 01:08:27,348
being that way because she
was written to be a man?

1363
01:08:27,447 --> 01:08:30,517
Ripley is the only
maternal character

1364
01:08:30,617 --> 01:08:32,686
within her Promethean crew.

1365
01:08:32,786 --> 01:08:36,657
Her transformation
gives us direction

1366
01:08:36,757 --> 01:08:39,559
for the transformation that
we need to take as a culture

1367
01:08:39,660 --> 01:08:41,229
to avoid self-destruction.

1368
01:08:41,329 --> 01:08:42,096
She's a new example.

1369
01:08:44,798 --> 01:08:47,001
ADAM MORTIMER: When we start
off this sequence with Kane,

1370
01:08:47,101 --> 01:08:49,436
this very strange
shot that's low angle,

1371
01:08:49,536 --> 01:08:51,039
and he's all the
way to the side...

1372
01:08:51,139 --> 01:08:53,942
And maybe at that point,
for want of a better term,

1373
01:08:54,042 --> 01:08:55,843
there's kind of this something's
being buried inside you,

1374
01:08:55,944 --> 01:08:57,412
something's been
planted in your brain,

1375
01:08:57,511 --> 01:08:59,080
and you're not sure what.

1376
01:08:59,180 --> 01:09:00,148
PARKER: How you doing?

1377
01:09:00,248 --> 01:09:01,049
IAN NATHAN: Kane
seems all right.

1378
01:09:01,149 --> 01:09:02,582
He's even smiling a bit.

1379
01:09:02,683 --> 01:09:03,918
He's not at his best, but
he's... he's looking a bit peaky,

1380
01:09:04,018 --> 01:09:06,653
but he's starting
to kind of cough.

1381
01:09:06,753 --> 01:09:08,890
Before you realize
what really happens,

1382
01:09:08,990 --> 01:09:10,590
your brain is
already ahead of you.

1383
01:09:10,691 --> 01:09:14,429
Your brain is going, it's
in him, and it's coming out.

1384
01:09:14,528 --> 01:09:15,796
ADAM MORTIMER: One thing
that he's certainly

1385
01:09:15,897 --> 01:09:19,100
taking advantage of is
the incredible width

1386
01:09:19,200 --> 01:09:20,868
of the anamorphic frame.

1387
01:09:20,969 --> 01:09:24,372
The entire cast is in
this one wide shot.

1388
01:09:24,471 --> 01:09:26,975
What could be safer
than every single cast

1389
01:09:27,075 --> 01:09:31,545
member in a brightly lit
white room in a horror movie?

1390
01:09:31,645 --> 01:09:32,981
Everything in that
ship is so dark.

1391
01:09:33,081 --> 01:09:35,749
I mean, the light Ridley
Scott uses is literally

1392
01:09:35,850 --> 01:09:37,018
the light from the torches.

1393
01:09:37,118 --> 01:09:38,386
That's it, right?

1394
01:09:38,485 --> 01:09:40,888
But that scene, oh my god, you
could operate in that scene.

1395
01:09:40,989 --> 01:09:42,457
And you needed to
operate in that scene,

1396
01:09:42,556 --> 01:09:45,659
but they couldn't
save the patient.

1397
01:09:45,759 --> 01:09:47,661
ADAM MORTIMER: You
go to Ash's reaction.

1398
01:09:47,761 --> 01:09:49,730
I think that really,
the key to the tension

1399
01:09:49,831 --> 01:09:52,433
here is tracking Ash, because
he's always in opposition

1400
01:09:52,532 --> 01:09:54,634
to everybody else.

1401
01:09:54,735 --> 01:09:56,404
It's a very short shot,
and you wouldn't notice it

1402
01:09:56,503 --> 01:09:57,604
the first time, but
when you go back

1403
01:09:57,704 --> 01:09:59,606
and rewatch it you
realize, he knows

1404
01:09:59,706 --> 01:10:01,075
that this is going to happen.

1405
01:10:01,175 --> 01:10:04,078
There's so many more
single one shots of him

1406
01:10:04,178 --> 01:10:07,681
in this very strange off-kilter
framing that really gives him

1407
01:10:07,781 --> 01:10:10,852
this sinister
surveillance kind of vibe,

1408
01:10:10,952 --> 01:10:12,453
whereas most of the
other characters, you're

1409
01:10:12,552 --> 01:10:15,990
seeing them in groups, because
they're all on the same team.

1410
01:10:16,090 --> 01:10:18,426
You believe that this is because
he has a better intuition

1411
01:10:18,558 --> 01:10:20,727
than the rest of them about how
dangerous it is and he's trying

1412
01:10:20,828 --> 01:10:22,930
to protect them,
but in fact, he's

1413
01:10:23,031 --> 01:10:26,566
trying to protect this
baby monster that he's

1414
01:10:26,666 --> 01:10:27,869
allowed to come into the world.

1415
01:10:27,969 --> 01:10:30,371
This son of a bitch is huge.

1416
01:10:30,471 --> 01:10:31,873
I mean, it's like a man.

1417
01:10:31,973 --> 01:10:33,007
It's big.

1418
01:10:33,107 --> 01:10:35,609
Kane's son.

1419
01:10:35,709 --> 01:10:37,744
Ash is such a dick.

1420
01:10:37,845 --> 01:10:39,914
DALLAS: Ash, you
hear or see anything?

1421
01:10:42,749 --> 01:10:46,187
When you think about it,
he's not an authentic being.

1422
01:10:46,287 --> 01:10:53,828
So someone, a human person had
to program him, educate him.

1423
01:10:53,928 --> 01:10:56,431
Not only is he supposed
to look like a person,

1424
01:10:56,531 --> 01:10:59,367
he's supposed to
pass as a person,

1425
01:10:59,467 --> 01:11:01,069
because the crew didn't know.

1426
01:11:01,169 --> 01:11:06,274
And that's what
makes him the worse.

1427
01:11:06,374 --> 01:11:09,243
That misogyny was built-in.

1428
01:11:09,343 --> 01:11:10,610
Could kill him.

1429
01:11:10,710 --> 01:11:12,413
CLARKE WOLFE: Ash
looks at Dallas,

1430
01:11:12,513 --> 01:11:13,680
like, what do you think?

1431
01:11:13,780 --> 01:11:14,781
I'm willing to
take that chance.

1432
01:11:14,882 --> 01:11:16,184
Just cut it off of him.

1433
01:11:16,284 --> 01:11:17,351
You take responsibility?

1434
01:11:17,452 --> 01:11:18,553
Yes, yes, I'll
take responsibility.

1435
01:11:18,652 --> 01:11:20,021
Now get it off of him.

1436
01:11:20,121 --> 01:11:22,390
CLARKE WOLFE: Ripley, on
the other hand, is saying,

1437
01:11:22,490 --> 01:11:23,590
I am making this call.

1438
01:11:23,690 --> 01:11:25,493
It's my job to make this call.

1439
01:11:25,625 --> 01:11:27,061
DALLAS: Ripley,
this is an order.

1440
01:11:27,161 --> 01:11:28,029
You hear me?

1441
01:11:28,129 --> 01:11:29,063
Yes.

1442
01:11:29,163 --> 01:11:29,763
I read you.

1443
01:11:29,864 --> 01:11:33,700
The answer is negative.

1444
01:11:33,800 --> 01:11:35,069
Inner hatch opened.

1445
01:11:35,169 --> 01:11:37,637
And he says, nope,
that's not gonna happen.

1446
01:11:37,737 --> 01:11:39,240
I override you.

1447
01:11:39,340 --> 01:11:44,611
Where does he get the idea to
penetrate this woman forcibly?

1448
01:11:44,711 --> 01:11:46,180
You know, but it
doesn't logically

1449
01:11:46,280 --> 01:11:48,816
make sense for an artificial
life form to do that.

1450
01:11:48,916 --> 01:11:49,851
He would choke her.

1451
01:11:49,951 --> 01:11:51,886
He would suffocate her.

1452
01:11:51,986 --> 01:11:56,924
The final choice that
he makes is to just

1453
01:11:57,024 --> 01:11:59,060
put this woman in her place.

1454
01:11:59,160 --> 01:12:02,930
The programming... think,
if we think about that,

1455
01:12:03,030 --> 01:12:08,136
if we really unpack that,
it's so frustrating.

1456
01:12:08,236 --> 01:12:10,271
[shouts] I hate him.

1457
01:12:10,371 --> 01:12:12,639
[laughs]

1458
01:12:13,808 --> 01:12:15,176
ADAM MORTIMER: Another
thing that I think

1459
01:12:15,276 --> 01:12:18,745
about is the tradition of
dramatizations that happen

1460
01:12:18,846 --> 01:12:21,681
over dinners, which
you can see in anything

1461
01:12:21,781 --> 01:12:25,052
from Chekov, to Ibsen,
going back to Shakespeare.

1462
01:12:25,153 --> 01:12:27,922
And I can't help but think of
"Guess Who's Coming to Dinner."

1463
01:12:28,022 --> 01:12:30,358
And in this case, it's the
alien who's coming to dinner

1464
01:12:30,458 --> 01:12:34,962
and shreds the social
fabric of the dinner table.

1465
01:12:35,062 --> 01:12:38,232
But the text and the subtext
is totally about food, right?

1466
01:12:38,332 --> 01:12:40,968
The first thing that I'm
gonna do when I get back

1467
01:12:41,068 --> 01:12:43,137
is to get some decent food.

1468
01:12:43,237 --> 01:12:44,172
I can dig it, man.

1469
01:12:44,272 --> 01:12:45,606
I'm telling you I've
eaten worse food...

1470
01:12:45,705 --> 01:12:46,807
ADAM MORTIMER: Even
when it comes to...

1471
01:12:46,908 --> 01:12:48,376
there's this shot
across the table,

1472
01:12:48,476 --> 01:12:52,146
and you can see the cat in
the background, soft focus,

1473
01:12:52,246 --> 01:12:54,015
it's eating dinner too.

1474
01:12:54,115 --> 01:12:56,851
KANE: Usually you know
what it's made of.

1475
01:12:56,951 --> 01:12:59,753
No, man, I don't want to
talk about what it's made of.

1476
01:12:59,854 --> 01:13:00,720
I'm eating...

1477
01:13:00,821 --> 01:13:02,190
What's the food made of?

1478
01:13:02,290 --> 01:13:05,759
It's made out of your
fucking insides of your body.

1479
01:13:05,860 --> 01:13:07,862
And there's just this
cluster of noise.

1480
01:13:07,962 --> 01:13:10,932
And it's almost like you're
hearing it from the point

1481
01:13:11,032 --> 01:13:12,699
of view of the chestburster.

1482
01:13:12,799 --> 01:13:14,768
It's inside of Kane.

1483
01:13:14,869 --> 01:13:16,736
It's fully conscious.

1484
01:13:16,837 --> 01:13:18,639
It's about to come through him.

1485
01:13:18,738 --> 01:13:21,609
It's first impressions
of the universe

1486
01:13:21,708 --> 01:13:23,077
are hearing these
indistinct voices

1487
01:13:23,177 --> 01:13:24,645
of all of these human beings.

1488
01:13:24,744 --> 01:13:27,949
It's like you're in
this sort of sonic womb.

1489
01:13:28,049 --> 01:13:32,453
ROGER CORMAN: Now, from the
laughter, comes of first sign

1490
01:13:32,553 --> 01:13:35,755
that something is wrong.

1491
01:13:35,856 --> 01:13:39,994
That is John brilliantly
portraying the beginning

1492
01:13:40,094 --> 01:13:42,729
of the pain within him.

1493
01:13:42,830 --> 01:13:48,002
The reaction of everybody
is so precise, so right.

1494
01:13:48,102 --> 01:13:49,604
ADAM MORTIMER: As soon
as this guy gets sick,

1495
01:13:49,704 --> 01:13:52,206
and he flips hand-held
behind his head,

1496
01:13:52,306 --> 01:13:54,809
you feel like you're in this
completely different world.

1497
01:13:54,909 --> 01:13:57,812
To me, Ridley's really
pulling a Kubrick here.

1498
01:13:57,912 --> 01:13:59,647
You see this in
"Clockwork Orange,"

1499
01:13:59,746 --> 01:14:01,249
you see this in "Barry Lyndon."

1500
01:14:01,349 --> 01:14:04,619
In all of these movies, you
have Kubrick approaching

1501
01:14:04,719 --> 01:14:07,588
sets and characters
with a very squared

1502
01:14:07,688 --> 01:14:09,756
off and rigid formal style.

1503
01:14:09,857 --> 01:14:11,993
But when violence
happens, Kubrick

1504
01:14:12,093 --> 01:14:15,296
will drastically change the
kind of visual vocabulary

1505
01:14:15,396 --> 01:14:16,731
of the scene.

1506
01:14:16,831 --> 01:14:17,965
ADAM MORTIMER: It's
this amazing choice

1507
01:14:18,065 --> 01:14:20,134
to not see Kane's face
at the very moment

1508
01:14:20,234 --> 01:14:22,169
that he's going
through the most agony.

1509
01:14:22,270 --> 01:14:24,338
It's incredibly
unnerving, and it's

1510
01:14:24,438 --> 01:14:27,208
sort of a taste of
what's about to happen

1511
01:14:27,308 --> 01:14:30,811
25 seconds later when it becomes
one of the messiest scenes

1512
01:14:30,911 --> 01:14:32,179
in film history.

1513
01:14:32,280 --> 01:14:34,749
RIDLEY SCOTT: Hello,
Roger, and cut, push out.

1514
01:14:34,849 --> 01:14:36,717
ROGER CHRISTIAN: It
was kind of looming

1515
01:14:36,817 --> 01:14:38,252
at us this scene, you know?

1516
01:14:38,352 --> 01:14:40,855
Everyone was a bit
worried about it for sure,

1517
01:14:40,955 --> 01:14:42,923
because A, it'd never
been done before,

1518
01:14:43,024 --> 01:14:46,494
and there was so much
preparation around it.

1519
01:14:46,594 --> 01:14:48,829
IAN NATHAN: Like much of the
design work for the film,

1520
01:14:48,929 --> 01:14:51,332
it had taken a long while
to get to where they were.

1521
01:14:51,432 --> 01:14:54,035
And I don't know how fully
satisfied Ridley was.

1522
01:14:54,135 --> 01:14:56,003
I think the egg
and the facehugger

1523
01:14:56,103 --> 01:14:58,139
worked very clearly for him.

1524
01:14:58,239 --> 01:14:59,974
You'd have the kind of
witch's fingers element

1525
01:15:00,074 --> 01:15:01,776
of the facehugger, it's
slightly kind of sort

1526
01:15:01,876 --> 01:15:04,145
of insectile nature of it.

1527
01:15:04,245 --> 01:15:06,614
But the chestburster was
difficult, because it

1528
01:15:06,714 --> 01:15:07,782
had to appear childlike.

1529
01:15:07,882 --> 01:15:09,083
It had to at least
kind of function.

1530
01:15:09,183 --> 01:15:11,152
It had to be able to
come out of his chest,

1531
01:15:11,252 --> 01:15:13,654
it had to suggest
the creature to come.

1532
01:15:13,754 --> 01:15:16,757
So in a way, the design of the
chestburster was governed most,

1533
01:15:16,857 --> 01:15:19,260
I think, by function
and practicality,

1534
01:15:19,360 --> 01:15:24,165
the need the sequence as much by
the flamboyance of Giger's work

1535
01:15:24,265 --> 01:15:29,003
and then Scott's desire to
create something extraordinary.

1536
01:15:29,103 --> 01:15:31,238
IVOR POWELL: They couldn't
solve the look of it.

1537
01:15:31,339 --> 01:15:33,974
Giger had a go at
the chestburster,

1538
01:15:34,075 --> 01:15:35,743
and he says he
never got it right.

1539
01:15:35,843 --> 01:15:37,345
It wasn't working.

1540
01:15:37,445 --> 01:15:40,881
I did some design they looked
like chicken, something like...

1541
01:15:40,981 --> 01:15:43,684
like chicken without feathers.

1542
01:15:43,784 --> 01:15:46,320
But I was not happy with.

1543
01:15:46,420 --> 01:15:50,124
And then build up
the thing, and it

1544
01:15:50,224 --> 01:15:53,260
looked like a small dinosaur.

1545
01:15:53,361 --> 01:15:55,229
IAN NATHAN: It had versions that
kind of looked like a turkey

1546
01:15:55,329 --> 01:15:57,598
that had been sort of plucked.

1547
01:15:57,698 --> 01:15:59,100
Just were laughable.

1548
01:15:59,200 --> 01:16:01,502
They couldn't come up with
something that was genuinely

1549
01:16:01,602 --> 01:16:03,671
terrifying in its own right.

1550
01:16:03,771 --> 01:16:05,473
ROGER CHRISTIAN:
Roger Dicken went away

1551
01:16:05,573 --> 01:16:07,575
and developed it on his own.

1552
01:16:07,675 --> 01:16:10,678
He was able to make it work.

1553
01:16:10,778 --> 01:16:13,147
They had made
this little puppet.

1554
01:16:13,247 --> 01:16:16,450
Frankly, it looked
like a penis and...

1555
01:16:16,550 --> 01:16:17,718
with teeth.

1556
01:16:17,819 --> 01:16:20,888
And they had, like,
they said, and we're

1557
01:16:20,988 --> 01:16:24,091
going to have it so
that it'll just blow up,

1558
01:16:24,191 --> 01:16:25,493
and then these
teeth will come out.

1559
01:16:25,593 --> 01:16:27,895
They were like, describing this.

1560
01:16:27,995 --> 01:16:29,764
It's just a thing.

1561
01:16:29,865 --> 01:16:32,400
[laughs] We were going, oh, OK.

1562
01:16:32,500 --> 01:16:35,970
I mean, they were so excited,
these puppeteer people.

1563
01:16:36,070 --> 01:16:38,672
They were... it was
just hysterical.

1564
01:16:38,773 --> 01:16:40,908
IAN NATHAN: The fundamental math
of the chestburster sequence

1565
01:16:41,008 --> 01:16:42,878
is that the cast didn't know.

1566
01:16:42,977 --> 01:16:44,578
Course, this isn't quite true.

1567
01:16:44,678 --> 01:16:47,014
We knew that there was going
to be a chestburster scene,

1568
01:16:47,114 --> 01:16:49,818
we just didn't know how
it was going to be done.

1569
01:16:49,917 --> 01:16:51,419
ROGER CHRISTIAN: John
Hurt obviously knew,

1570
01:16:51,519 --> 01:16:54,789
so they just kept him plied with
red wine and cigarettes all day

1571
01:16:54,890 --> 01:16:56,090
long.

1572
01:16:56,190 --> 01:16:59,527
They knew they were
relying on his patience

1573
01:16:59,627 --> 01:17:03,998
to stay in that position
while everything was set up.

1574
01:17:04,098 --> 01:17:07,067
The atmosphere on the
set had a certain frisson,

1575
01:17:07,168 --> 01:17:09,470
you know, in the morning,
because everybody

1576
01:17:09,570 --> 01:17:12,339
knew that this was filmically,
a sort of major scene.

1577
01:17:12,440 --> 01:17:14,175
I don't think anybody had
any idea that it would

1578
01:17:14,275 --> 01:17:16,710
become a kind of film classic.

1579
01:17:16,812 --> 01:17:19,413
IAN NATHAN: Roger Dicken brought
the chestburster to the set

1580
01:17:19,513 --> 01:17:20,948
in a carrier bag.

1581
01:17:21,048 --> 01:17:22,550
Blood was being loaded.

1582
01:17:22,650 --> 01:17:25,286
All the crew was sort of donning
these rain jackets because they

1583
01:17:25,386 --> 01:17:27,087
kind of knew what was coming.

1584
01:17:27,188 --> 01:17:29,056
ROGER CHRISTIAN: In the
morning, Ridley said, let's put

1585
01:17:29,156 --> 01:17:31,158
some bits of gristle and stuff.

1586
01:17:31,258 --> 01:17:33,461
So I sent the buyer
down to the abattoir

1587
01:17:33,561 --> 01:17:38,799
to buy a load of offal,
which stank terrible.

1588
01:17:38,900 --> 01:17:42,938
And they put it in formaldehyde
for you, but it was worse.

1589
01:17:43,037 --> 01:17:44,104
But we packed it round.

1590
01:17:44,205 --> 01:17:45,573
And Ridley was doing
it himself too.

1591
01:17:45,673 --> 01:17:49,811
We were sticking it
all around underneath.

1592
01:17:49,911 --> 01:17:51,880
VERONICA CARTWRIGHT: We're
all up in our dressing rooms

1593
01:17:51,979 --> 01:17:53,514
at Shepperton Studios.

1594
01:17:53,614 --> 01:17:55,884
Harry Dean Stanton is
sitting in the hall

1595
01:17:55,983 --> 01:17:57,785
singing and playing guitar.

1596
01:17:57,886 --> 01:17:59,353
We're up there for hours.

1597
01:17:59,453 --> 01:18:02,623
We kept wondering, what
the... what was going on?

1598
01:18:02,723 --> 01:18:04,291
IAN NATHAN: But at a
certain point in time,

1599
01:18:04,391 --> 01:18:07,194
some assistant is sent
to bring them to set.

1600
01:18:07,294 --> 01:18:11,265
And what greets them isn't
a vision, it's a smell.

1601
01:18:11,365 --> 01:18:13,000
Because over these
hours, this kind

1602
01:18:13,100 --> 01:18:14,768
of offal and [inaudible]
produce has just

1603
01:18:14,870 --> 01:18:16,504
been cooking under the lights.

1604
01:18:16,604 --> 01:18:20,541
Literally, you gagged when
you walked onto the set.

1605
01:18:20,641 --> 01:18:21,810
It was so disgusting.

1606
01:18:21,910 --> 01:18:24,512
Ridley wasn't certain how
that was going to happen,

1607
01:18:24,612 --> 01:18:27,448
how... how... how's
that gonna manifest?

1608
01:18:27,548 --> 01:18:31,552
All this... this innards
of a cow and the blood,

1609
01:18:31,652 --> 01:18:34,355
and thinking, my.

1610
01:18:34,455 --> 01:18:35,824
DAN O'BANNON: What
they saw was John

1611
01:18:35,924 --> 01:18:39,126
Hurt spread out on this table
with all of these hoses.

1612
01:18:39,226 --> 01:18:41,262
Everybody is
covered up in suits.

1613
01:18:41,362 --> 01:18:44,064
The actors walk in, and they
see that waiting for them.

1614
01:18:44,164 --> 01:18:46,333
And I saw them, their
faces all sort of dropped.

1615
01:18:46,433 --> 01:18:49,871
They all sort of went like
this, and their eyes got big

1616
01:18:49,971 --> 01:18:51,806
and roamed around
all over this stuff.

1617
01:18:51,907 --> 01:18:54,575
VERONICA CARTWRIGHT: We
started to shoot the scene,

1618
01:18:54,675 --> 01:18:58,013
and I was told I'd get
a little blood on me.

1619
01:18:58,112 --> 01:19:00,447
So we start to roll.

1620
01:19:00,548 --> 01:19:03,852
IAN NATHAN: And then what
happens is brilliant.

1621
01:19:03,952 --> 01:19:08,055
There's just this splat, almost
like a bullet has hit him.

1622
01:19:08,155 --> 01:19:11,392
He puts a pause in.

1623
01:19:11,492 --> 01:19:13,995
You've got to kind of
give the audience a chance

1624
01:19:14,094 --> 01:19:15,864
to realize what's happened.

1625
01:19:15,964 --> 01:19:18,499
JOHN HURT: The whole thing
was really a trick in the cut.

1626
01:19:18,599 --> 01:19:20,301
And there was a cut
to the other side

1627
01:19:20,401 --> 01:19:23,704
of the table where by
which time I had been

1628
01:19:23,804 --> 01:19:25,339
replaced by a replica body.

1629
01:19:25,439 --> 01:19:28,309
His t-shirt pulled
you know, tightly on it,

1630
01:19:28,409 --> 01:19:34,348
and then there's gonna be blood
lines on high pressure pumps.

1631
01:19:34,448 --> 01:19:36,383
They're going to blow
blood everywhere.

1632
01:19:36,483 --> 01:19:39,520
So we start to roll,
and then all of a sudden,

1633
01:19:39,620 --> 01:19:40,554
Ridley shouts, cut.

1634
01:19:40,654 --> 01:19:41,488
Cut.

1635
01:19:41,589 --> 01:19:44,025
It didn't work
on the first take.

1636
01:19:44,124 --> 01:19:45,559
There wasn't much
of a chestburster.

1637
01:19:45,659 --> 01:19:47,795
It couldn't get through
the damn t-shirt.

1638
01:19:47,896 --> 01:19:50,331
Well, we found ourselves
leaning in to see

1639
01:19:50,431 --> 01:19:51,900
what the hell was going on.

1640
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:55,402
ROGER CHRISTIAN: Second time,
it still didn't go through,

1641
01:19:55,502 --> 01:19:57,237
but it came up
like that, and then

1642
01:19:57,338 --> 01:19:58,840
went down and covered in blood.

1643
01:19:58,940 --> 01:20:02,109
And the actors were all kind of
looking like that and curious.

1644
01:20:02,209 --> 01:20:07,581
So it was a stroke of
genius that it went wrong.

1645
01:20:07,681 --> 01:20:11,652
They still didn't
know what was coming.

1646
01:20:11,752 --> 01:20:13,387
And it reset again.

1647
01:20:13,487 --> 01:20:16,992
Ridley just said to Nick
Allder and to Roger Dicken,

1648
01:20:17,092 --> 01:20:18,994
just get it through this time.

1649
01:20:19,094 --> 01:20:22,763
And they added more
blood, more pipelines.

1650
01:20:22,864 --> 01:20:25,265
IAN NATHAN: And this thing
goes up through, splat.

1651
01:20:25,366 --> 01:20:27,002
They fire all the pumps.

1652
01:20:27,102 --> 01:20:28,268
ROGER CHRISTIAN:
When it went through,

1653
01:20:28,369 --> 01:20:32,206
I mean, that blood
just went everywhere.

1654
01:20:32,306 --> 01:20:34,508
It was just exactly
what Scott wanted.

1655
01:20:34,608 --> 01:20:38,445
It was just this absolutely
immediate visceral response.

1656
01:20:38,545 --> 01:20:43,118
When it happened, of
course, it stills you.

1657
01:20:43,217 --> 01:20:48,123
So that's how it manifests, huh?

1658
01:20:48,222 --> 01:20:49,124
RIDLEY SCOTT: God!

1659
01:20:49,223 --> 01:20:52,159
And again, Nick, and again!

1660
01:20:52,259 --> 01:20:55,729
VERONICA CARTWRIGHT: I had
leaned into a blood jet.

1661
01:20:55,830 --> 01:20:59,366
That little blood shot
me square in the face.

1662
01:20:59,466 --> 01:21:03,704
And that's when I jumped
back and I went, oh my god.

1663
01:21:03,804 --> 01:21:08,009
And my knees hit the
back of those banquette

1664
01:21:08,109 --> 01:21:12,713
where we were all sitting,
and it flipped me upside down.

1665
01:21:12,814 --> 01:21:15,150
And I said, oh my gosh,
we're still shooting.

1666
01:21:15,249 --> 01:21:17,251
So I rolled over
and I got back up,

1667
01:21:17,351 --> 01:21:21,089
and I ran around and
got back into the scene.

1668
01:21:21,188 --> 01:21:23,357
[laughs]

1669
01:21:24,859 --> 01:21:27,996
So there were different... there
were different reactions to it.

1670
01:21:28,096 --> 01:21:29,596
RIDLEY SCOTT: And action.

1671
01:21:29,697 --> 01:21:31,198
CREW: Blood.

1672
01:21:31,298 --> 01:21:32,199
RIDLEY SCOTT: Blood.

1673
01:21:32,299 --> 01:21:33,168
CREW: Enough.

1674
01:21:33,267 --> 01:21:33,868
RIDLEY SCOTT: Push it out.

1675
01:21:33,968 --> 01:21:35,003
Pump it.

1676
01:21:35,103 --> 01:21:36,071
ROGER CHRISTIAN:
Roger Dicken had

1677
01:21:36,171 --> 01:21:37,771
built little lungs in as well.

1678
01:21:37,872 --> 01:21:40,708
It was a lot of stuff
going on under the table

1679
01:21:40,809 --> 01:21:45,412
to make it look so real, hung
bits of stuff all over it so

1680
01:21:45,512 --> 01:21:47,414
that it looked like it
broke through the flesh

1681
01:21:47,514 --> 01:21:48,615
and heart and muscles.

1682
01:21:50,952 --> 01:21:56,557
That was part of Ridley wanting
this to be unquestionably real.

1683
01:21:56,657 --> 01:21:57,558
[monster crying]

1684
01:21:57,658 --> 01:22:00,095
And I think that
scream, when it screams,

1685
01:22:00,195 --> 01:22:01,996
there's the Bacon shot.

1686
01:22:02,097 --> 01:22:05,499
There's something really
strange in those paintings that

1687
01:22:05,599 --> 01:22:09,436
connects to the phobias that
we carry with us to this day,

1688
01:22:09,536 --> 01:22:11,572
and they come from
our ancient past.

1689
01:22:11,672 --> 01:22:14,109
So I think, you
know, particularly

1690
01:22:14,209 --> 01:22:17,812
the "Incubus" is
one that was struck

1691
01:22:17,912 --> 01:22:19,914
me when I read the script.

1692
01:22:20,014 --> 01:22:22,716
Because that chestburster
it comes out and sits there

1693
01:22:22,817 --> 01:22:25,887
for a moment and screams,
and that's just as you

1694
01:22:25,987 --> 01:22:27,354
imagine an incubus would do.

1695
01:22:27,454 --> 01:22:30,125
It would come out,
sit, and scream at you.

1696
01:22:30,225 --> 01:22:32,493
I loved that image
so much, and what

1697
01:22:32,593 --> 01:22:35,262
I see in it is something
that's like a material

1698
01:22:35,362 --> 01:22:38,133
object trying to come to life.

1699
01:22:38,233 --> 01:22:40,201
And that's what "Alien" is.

1700
01:22:40,300 --> 01:22:41,668
RIDLEY SCOTT: Slow.

1701
01:22:41,769 --> 01:22:42,937
Slow.

1702
01:22:43,037 --> 01:22:46,707
OK, and the head back.

1703
01:22:46,808 --> 01:22:49,110
Slow, Go!

1704
01:22:49,210 --> 01:22:49,944
Shit.

1705
01:22:50,044 --> 01:22:50,644
Great.

1706
01:22:50,744 --> 01:22:51,179
Cut it.

1707
01:22:51,278 --> 01:22:51,946
CREW: Cut it.

1708
01:22:52,046 --> 01:22:53,413
Save the blood.

1709
01:22:53,514 --> 01:22:55,482
DREW MORTON: When I'm watching
the chestburster scene

1710
01:22:55,582 --> 01:22:59,020
on the Nostromo, and I'm
thinking about how brilliantly

1711
01:22:59,120 --> 01:23:02,056
staged it is because it doesn't
take place in a dark corridor

1712
01:23:02,157 --> 01:23:03,624
with a guy all by himself.

1713
01:23:03,724 --> 01:23:07,661
And then decades
later, Ridley Scott

1714
01:23:07,761 --> 01:23:11,465
restages a chestburster scene
and does it exactly in that way

1715
01:23:11,565 --> 01:23:14,334
that's so much more tropey.

1716
01:23:14,434 --> 01:23:17,604
In the dark, a guy
alone being watched over

1717
01:23:17,704 --> 01:23:25,679
only by the malevolent David,
and with this smoke and lights

1718
01:23:25,779 --> 01:23:29,217
behind him, it's almost
like it's the first draft

1719
01:23:29,316 --> 01:23:30,819
of the original scene
that was rejected

1720
01:23:30,919 --> 01:23:34,421
and then for some
reason, revisited later.

1721
01:23:34,521 --> 01:23:38,425
But on the other hand,
there is something really

1722
01:23:38,525 --> 01:23:41,863
delightful if you give into it.

1723
01:23:41,963 --> 01:23:45,332
I feel like Ridley Scott
can't find a better way

1724
01:23:45,432 --> 01:23:49,570
to talk about his own
mortality than by going back

1725
01:23:49,670 --> 01:23:54,309
over and over to the origin
side of the height of his powers

1726
01:23:54,408 --> 01:23:57,511
and the height of
his creativity.

1727
01:23:57,611 --> 01:23:59,881
IAN NATHAN: If you look at
where Ridley Scott is currently

1728
01:23:59,981 --> 01:24:02,817
taking the "Alien"
cycle, he's using

1729
01:24:02,917 --> 01:24:05,320
it explicitly to
explore questions

1730
01:24:05,419 --> 01:24:07,588
of where did life come from?

1731
01:24:07,688 --> 01:24:10,992
What does it mean to be human?

1732
01:24:11,092 --> 01:24:15,796
He seems fascinated by the idea
that the child would destroy

1733
01:24:15,897 --> 01:24:22,070
the parent, that the created
would destroy the creator, that

1734
01:24:22,170 --> 01:24:26,007
things we make come back and
destroy us, which I suppose

1735
01:24:26,107 --> 01:24:28,609
are variations on the
Frankenstein story.

1736
01:24:28,709 --> 01:24:32,646
But the repeated recurrence
of this in his work

1737
01:24:32,746 --> 01:24:36,851
suggests, I think, a major
autistic obsession, actually.

1738
01:24:39,720 --> 01:24:43,024
People often talk of
Hollywood as the dream factory

1739
01:24:43,124 --> 01:24:45,626
but I think the dreams that
Hollywood puts on the screens

1740
01:24:45,726 --> 01:24:48,395
are not just the
dream of one person,

1741
01:24:48,495 --> 01:24:50,865
they're collective dreams.

1742
01:24:50,965 --> 01:24:55,435
Cinema is a window on our
collective unconscious.

1743
01:24:55,535 --> 01:24:58,139
And in that way, I
think that "Alien"

1744
01:24:58,239 --> 01:25:00,842
is an incredibly
important window

1745
01:25:00,942 --> 01:25:06,881
on what people were thinking
about as of the late 1970s.

1746
01:25:06,981 --> 01:25:09,583
When you look back an
alien 40 years later,

1747
01:25:09,683 --> 01:25:11,718
it seems prophetic
of where we've gone.

1748
01:25:11,819 --> 01:25:13,187
We're still going
in the same direction

1749
01:25:13,288 --> 01:25:15,957
that it seemed to be indicating
at the time, which makes

1750
01:25:16,057 --> 01:25:19,760
the world of "Alien," if not
probable, at least, you know,

1751
01:25:19,861 --> 01:25:21,628
looking like a
possibility in the way

1752
01:25:21,728 --> 01:25:23,497
that "Star Wars" could never be.

1753
01:25:23,597 --> 01:25:26,067
[alarms blaring]

1754
01:25:27,668 --> 01:25:30,704
The last act of "Alien" is
escaping self-destruction.

1755
01:25:30,804 --> 01:25:32,840
That's the myth of our times.

1756
01:25:32,941 --> 01:25:34,708
Part of what makes "Alien"
so powerful is it's

1757
01:25:34,809 --> 01:25:36,377
so much more than an allegory.

1758
01:25:36,476 --> 01:25:41,182
It taps into a deep set
of patterns that can

1759
01:25:41,282 --> 01:25:42,917
mean many, many, many things.

1760
01:25:43,017 --> 01:25:45,652
I don't think we can get
to the bottom of "Alien."

1761
01:25:45,752 --> 01:25:48,823
Like a piece of sand vibrating
in a somatic experiment,

1762
01:25:48,923 --> 01:25:51,692
in touch with something deeper,
Dan O'Bannon must have been

1763
01:25:51,792 --> 01:25:53,694
on the frequency for this myth.

1764
01:25:53,794 --> 01:25:59,000
He seems to have been a
stenograph for a larger song.

1765
01:25:59,100 --> 01:26:00,701
[gentle music]

1766
01:26:00,801 --> 01:26:04,504
DIANE O'BANNON: My husband
was out of time, in a way,

1767
01:26:04,604 --> 01:26:08,042
out of specific time.

1768
01:26:08,142 --> 01:26:09,543
But he lives on.

1769
01:26:09,643 --> 01:26:13,348
And when he was dying,
that's what I said to him.

1770
01:26:13,448 --> 01:26:15,383
He was not conscious.

1771
01:26:15,482 --> 01:26:17,885
I said, you moved the world.

1772
01:26:17,986 --> 01:26:18,552
You did it.

1773
01:26:18,652 --> 01:26:20,355
You moved the world.

1774
01:26:20,455 --> 01:26:22,223
And he did.

1775
01:26:22,323 --> 01:26:26,060
In a way, I don't think Dan
O'Bannon is finished yet.

1776
01:26:26,160 --> 01:26:30,231
When he died, I had
a strange feeling

1777
01:26:30,331 --> 01:26:35,370
that he'd gone back to the
future from whence he'd come.

1778
01:26:35,470 --> 01:26:39,340
And there's still things there
that are emerging from him

1779
01:26:39,440 --> 01:26:42,709
and things that I
have that are just

1780
01:26:42,810 --> 01:26:44,479
now becoming relevant today.

1781
01:26:44,578 --> 01:26:47,448
And there's more there.

1782
01:26:47,547 --> 01:26:48,715
There's more there.

1783
01:26:48,816 --> 01:26:51,152
Don't ask me why he
had this connection

1784
01:26:51,252 --> 01:26:55,957
to the past and the
future, but he sure did.

1785
01:26:56,057 --> 01:26:59,659
He came from a place that had
no telephone or television

1786
01:26:59,760 --> 01:27:03,031
and went to the stars.

1787
01:27:03,131 --> 01:27:03,697
Went to the stars.

1788
01:27:03,797 --> 01:27:05,199
It's inexplicable.

1789
01:27:05,299 --> 01:27:06,800
[downbeat music]

1790
01:27:59,786 --> 01:28:02,689
[gentle eerie music]

1791
01:28:02,790 --> 01:28:07,790
