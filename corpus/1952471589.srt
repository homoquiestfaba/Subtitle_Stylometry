-That’s it, fellas.
-[ Men ] Aw.!

951
00:58:53,990 --> 00:58:56,990
Sorry, man.

952
00:58:56,990 --> 00:58:58,990
Davis ain’t gettin’ no letter, Junior?

953
00:58:58,990 --> 00:59:09,990
Look, I got one.

954
00:59:02,950 --> 00:59:04,960
I ain’t got a letter yet.
You gotta read that to me.

955
00:59:04,960 --> 00:59:08,960
-Has anybody seen my green socks?
-We all got green socks.!

956
00:59:08,960 --> 00:59:10,960
Let’s see what he has to say.

957
00:59:10,960 --> 00:59:13,970
How ya doin’. How ya’ doin’.
How ya doin’.

958
00:59:14,970 --> 00:59:15,970
Let’s see, uh--

959
00:59:16,970 --> 00:59:19,970
Oh, listen. Dad put new
holleys on the Camaro...

960
00:59:19,970 --> 00:59:23,980
so he could race it up at the speedway.

961
00:59:23,980 --> 00:59:27,980
It was runnin’ like greased owl shit.

962
00:59:27,980 --> 00:59:30,980
Hey, that’s a simile, Mel.

963
00:59:30,980 --> 00:59:32,980
That is a simile, ain’t it?

964
00:59:32,980 --> 00:59:34,990
Damn right.

965
00:59:34,990 --> 00:59:39,990
Let’s see. Then Toby drove it last week
and threw a rod...

966
00:59:39,990 --> 00:59:44,950
and Dad got mad and threw him
down the stairs.

967
00:59:46,960 --> 00:59:49,960
This ain’t my real dad.
This is my step dad.

968
00:59:50,960 --> 00:59:53,960
Things are sure different...

969
00:59:53,960 --> 00:59:56,970
now that you’re in the marines.

970
00:59:56,970 --> 01:00:09,750

-Well, he’s 1 2.
He gets ‘em mixed up, ya know.

971
01:00:03,970 --> 01:00:08,980
so I guess he’s startin’ in
on his real kids.

972
01:00:11,980 --> 01:00:16,990
Mel, what kind of Camaro has he got?
A Z-28?

973
01:00:18,990 --> 01:00:20,990
Mel. You okay, Mel?

974
01:00:23,990 --> 01:00:25,950
Mel?

975

[ Sighs ] I ain’t never
gonna hit my kids.

Oh, don’t start
sleepin’ again, Mel.

977
01:00:35,960 --> 01:00:37,970
You know it ain’t
gonna solve nothin’.

-Your little boy ain’t gonna die

-Oh! Aw, jeez!
-What’s the matter? Heart attack?

01:00:57,990 --> 01:00:59,990
-It’s the food, I’m tellin’ you.
-Oh, Jesus!

983
01:00:59,990 --> 01:01:02,990
Junior, where you goin’?

984
01:01:02,990 --> 01:01:06,950
-I gotta go back.!
-We’re gonna be late! Junior!

-Jesus.
-What’s your freakin’ problem, Davis?

988
01:01:16,960 --> 01:01:19,970
-My bag! My daddy’s bracelet!
-His what?

989
01:01:19,970 --> 01:01:23,970
-It’s a Montagnard bracelet.
He got it in Vietnam.
-He wore a bracelet?

990
01:01:23,970 --> 01:01:25,970
Lots of soldiers wore ‘em over there.
I left it in my shirt pocket.

991
01:01:25,970 --> 01:01:28,980
Good, now it’ll be clean.
Come on. Let’s go.

992
01:01:28,980 --> 01:01:30,980
Come on, man!
What if it gets lost?

993
01:01:30,980 --> 01:01:33,980
Please, you gotta help me, man.
It’s all I got.

994
01:01:34,980 --> 01:01:37,980
We gotta get this
to the quartermaster’s laundry on time.

995
01:01:37,980 --> 01:01:40,990
[ Imitating Al Pacino ] I don’t care.
Look for the bracelet, okay?

996
01:01:40,990 --> 01:01:44,990
-All right. What’s his name?
-His name is Brian Davis, Jr.

997

-Come on, man. This is stupid.
-[ As Pacino ] Shut up, you!

I kill you, you cockroach!
Shut up!

999

Now look. I gotta touch
the dirty clothes, man? You kiddin’ me.

Oh, man, thank you. Thank you!

What was that again?
What time is it?

1006
01:02:12,980 --> 01:02:16,980
Drill Sergeant!
Breakfast is at 0600, Drill Sergeant!

1007
01:02:16,980 --> 01:02:18,980
Zero six hundred.
That’s correct.

1008
01:02:18,980 --> 01:02:22,990
Which by my reckoning
has come and gone, has it not?

1009
01:02:22,990 --> 01:02:25,990
-Drill Sergeant.! Yes, Drill Sergeant.!
-Hi, Miranda.

1010

[ Cass ] I don’t know. Maybe it’s me.
I just can’t seem to hear ya.

1011

I don’t hear that--

1012

Front and center.!

1014
01:02:45,970 --> 01:02:48,970
You wouldn’t happen
to have the time, would you, Private?

1015
01:02:48,970 --> 01:02:50,970
Sorry, Drill Sergeant.
Slight problem with the laundry.

1016
01:02:50,970 --> 01:02:54,980
Does this building look
like a Denny’s to you, New York? Huh?

1017
01:02:54,980 --> 01:02:58,980
Show me where it says
breakfast served anytime.

1018
01:02:58,980 --> 01:03:09,890
Get on down there and push ten.

Who was I talkin’ to?
Was I talkin’ to you?

1020
01:03:04,990 --> 01:03:07,990
Drill Sergeant, I asked him to help me
find my daddy’s bracelet.

-My daddy! My daddy!
-My daddy sent it--

Your daddy ain’t here, son,
and your daddy can’t help you.

I don’t know if anybody
can help you, high-speed.

He’s five minutes late.

1027

been toilet-trained at gunpoint.

No, there’s nothin’ else for me to do.

I was black and I played ball.
That’s all anybody ever cared about.

1268

but, oh, they kept passin’ me.

I’m keepin’ that kid as far away from
the playin’ field as I can.

1274

nobody pass a civil service exam.

Hey, Leroy.

1277
01:17:41,010 --> 01:17:45,010
Ya ever hear of a guy named
Leonbattista Alberti?

1278
01:17:45,010 --> 01:17:47,010
Yeah, yeah. He played
for the 49ers, right?

1279
01:17:47,010 --> 01:17:50,020
Nah. He played for the 1 400s.

1280
01:17:50,020 --> 01:17:52,020
The renaissance.

1281
01:17:52,020 --> 01:17:55,020
- The what?
- He’s what you’d call a renaissance man.

1282
01:17:55,020 --> 01:17:59,030
The guy was an architect, a writer,
a painter, a musician...

1283
01:17:59,030 --> 01:18:01,030
a scholar--
god knows what else.

1284
01:18:02,030 --> 01:18:04,030
But you know what
I remember most about him?

1285
01:18:04,030 --> 01:18:08,990
They say that he could
stand with his feet together like this...

1286
01:18:08,990 --> 01:18:11,000
and spring straight over a man’s head.

1287
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:15,000
- Re-- Really?
- Yeah.

1288
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:18,000
If Leonbattista Alberti
couldn’t have done that...

1289
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:21,010
I wouldn’t have remembered
a thing about him.

1290
01:18:21,010 --> 01:18:24,010
So he was sort of like
a smart jock, then, right?

1291

That’s right. You got it.

1292
01:18:27,010 --> 01:18:29,010
Now, ain’t that an oxymoron?

- Talk to you later, Mr. Rago.
- All right.

1296
01:18:40,030 --> 01:18:44,030
The real question is, is Ophelia right?

1297
01:18:44,030 --> 01:18:48,030
Is Hamlet crazy?

Go on.

1301
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:03,010
Well, it’s like he says.
Denmark’s a prison.

1302
01:19:03,010 --> 01:19:07,010
Everybody’s watchin’ him
all the time, spyin’ on him.

1303
01:19:07,010 --> 01:19:11,010
If he thinks Denmark’s a prison, all he
gotta do is move to a trailer park.

1304
01:19:11,010 --> 01:19:14,020
Tiny little rooms,
six brothers and sisters.

1305

It can make you crazy.
