Yah! Up you go, maxi-pad!

00:02:52,339 --> 00:02:53,405
Knock it off, Heidi.

6
00:03:02,815 --> 00:03:04,183
Oh, my god.

7
00:03:21,768 --> 00:03:23,969
Whoo! Here we go, Max!
Bring me that brick!

8
00:03:25,672 --> 00:03:26,772
C'mon now!

<i>You know what
you have to do, maxi.</i>

18
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:16,448
Looks like someone wants a kiss!

19
00:05:16,450 --> 00:05:17,749
Ooh!

20
00:05:28,728 --> 00:05:29,795
Well?

21
00:05:29,797 --> 00:05:33,498
Well, what? He loves me.

22
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:35,334
He didn't give you detention?

23
00:05:35,336 --> 00:05:38,437
Detention? Please, girl.

24
00:05:38,439 --> 00:05:41,440
How he gon' give me detention when he
knows we gon' set this up on Friday!

25
00:05:41,808 --> 00:05:44,443
Huh?

26
00:05:44,445 --> 00:05:46,545
Well, no, Valentine's is, uh,
Valentine's is tonight...

27
00:05:46,547 --> 00:05:48,113
Why... why would we go Friday?

28
00:05:51,351 --> 00:05:53,652
Well, I can't do Friday.

29
00:05:53,654 --> 00:05:54,786
Well, no, you know,
the, the talent show.

30
00:05:54,788 --> 00:05:55,788
Talent show fund raiser

31
00:05:57,457 --> 00:06:00,792
no, no, the talent show that the
kids organized for my operation.

32
00:06:00,794 --> 00:06:02,894
Aw.

33
00:06:02,896 --> 00:06:07,032
Did you really think
Mr. Rockwell was trying

34
00:06:07,034 --> 00:06:09,468
to kiss your little rat lips?

35
00:06:10,904 --> 00:06:11,904
Hmm?

36
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:17,409
Hmm?

37
00:06:17,411 --> 00:06:20,412
Hey! I'm talking to you,
maxi-pad.

38
00:06:20,414 --> 00:06:23,615
No, no, I know, but, you
know, it's a nice gesture,

39
00:06:23,617 --> 00:06:25,057
you know how much
these kids love me.

40
00:06:25,985 --> 00:06:28,453
Not like that.

41
00:06:28,455 --> 00:06:30,622
No, they look up
to me, Kim, all right.

42
00:06:30,624 --> 00:06:33,725
And I'd be a real jerk to ditch out on
my own fundraiser, don't you think?

43
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:37,729
You really think
he'd go for you?

44
00:06:37,731 --> 00:06:40,165
Over me?

45
00:06:40,167 --> 00:06:44,136
Just wait until he sees the twerking routine
we came up with for the talent show.

46
00:06:44,138 --> 00:06:47,005
Real Nicki Minaj shit.

47
00:06:47,007 --> 00:06:49,541
That's fine. No, no, no,
you know what, that's great.

48
00:06:49,543 --> 00:06:50,876
Ya, I love you too.

00:06:59,852 --> 00:07:01,853
Heart and lung foundation

50
00:07:01,855 --> 00:07:03,855
Mr, Rockwell,
we regret to inform

51
00:07:08,095 --> 00:07:10,629
what are you doing
to get him a new heart?

52
00:07:10,631 --> 00:07:12,798
Did you organize a talent show?

53
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:16,902
Are you gonna perform
something? Hmm?

54
00:07:16,904 --> 00:07:21,573
Ooh, I know. How about a
little game of show and tell?

55
00:07:21,575 --> 00:07:26,011
First you show everybody your
little friend, Mr. box cutter.

56
00:07:26,013 --> 00:07:30,081
And then just watch
as those donations pour in

57
00:07:30,083 --> 00:07:36,154
when you tell them it's the
same toy your dear dead daddy

58
00:07:36,156 --> 00:07:37,456
killed himself with.

59
00:07:49,769 --> 00:07:51,002
I gotta meet Rick.

60
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:02,948
Uh, you're not going
to go take a shower?

61
00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:04,182
No, I'll take one at home.

62
00:08:06,052 --> 00:08:09,521
I heard this one has rats in it.

63
00:08:39,185 --> 00:08:41,820

67
00:11:10,970 --> 00:11:13,338
stop following me, maxi-pad.

68
00:11:16,942 --> 00:11:20,011
You're acting really weird
today, even for you.

69
00:11:23,015 --> 00:11:25,016
Well, go ahead.

70
00:11:33,793 --> 00:11:35,993
Well, I'm gonna cut through the woods.
See you tomorrow.

71
00:11:39,231 --> 00:11:40,799
Happy Valentine's day.

72
00:12:02,922 --> 00:12:04,189
What are you doing?

73
00:12:10,796 --> 00:12:12,964
You don't even live this way.

74
00:12:17,436 --> 00:12:19,270
Stop following me.

75
00:12:30,282 --> 00:12:31,516
Now look what you did!

76
00:13:03,983 --> 00:13:06,851
I... I... I was just kidding.

77
00:13:39,186 --> 00:13:40,485
We're going to be late.

78
00:13:40,487 --> 00:13:42,554
Well, I thought
I had until Friday.

79
00:13:42,556 --> 00:13:46,024
Why would you think that?
Valentine's day is tonight!

80
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:24,028
Give me your heart

81
00:14:24,030 --> 00:14:25,330

<i>shamrocks. Irish dancing.
Parades of green.</i>

85

<i>These are some of the images

86
00:14:42,883 --> 00:14:44,215
<i>of St. Patrick's day.</i>

87
00:14:47,287 --> 00:14:50,955
On weekends I play with my
magical whores

<i>but who exactly
was St. Patrick?</i>

89
00:14:57,230 --> 00:15:00,131
<i>And how did he deliver

00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:04,569
<i>According to legend,</i>

93
00:15:04,571 --> 00:15:08,473
<i>Patrick banished all of the snakes from
Ireland by tossing them into the sea.</i>

94
00:15:08,475 --> 00:15:12,277
<i>Although evidence suggests there
were no snakes in Ireland</i>

95
00:15:12,279 --> 00:15:14,212
<i>during the 5th century.</i>

96
00:15:14,214 --> 00:15:17,048
<i>Most scholars believe this
to be a metaphor.</i>

97

<i>St. Patrick's expulsion

<i>Long may Ireland let slip from

99
00:15:31,563 --> 00:15:32,563
Hiya, Grainne.

100
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:36,935
That's very pretty.
Who is it for?

101
00:15:38,404 --> 00:15:39,504
Okay.

102
00:15:41,473 --> 00:15:44,943
Look. I know
how hard change is,

103
00:15:44,945 --> 00:15:48,179
coming to a new school,
not having any friends.

104
00:15:48,181 --> 00:15:51,649
But I bet if you were to show us
that smile just for a second,

105
00:15:51,651 --> 00:15:54,385
it would make all the
difference in the world.

106
00:15:56,388 --> 00:15:58,389
Do you know what?
I have an idea.

107
00:15:59,692 --> 00:16:01,960
Would you like to ring
the lunch bell?

108
00:16:56,682 --> 00:16:58,683
Only your deepest wish
can make me smile

109
00:17:04,124 --> 00:17:08,059
<i>hiya, it's me.</i>

110
00:17:08,061 --> 00:17:10,461
<i>I can't chat for long.
I'm here waiting for Sam.</i>

111
00:17:10,463 --> 00:17:12,764
<i>He's insisted I park away from
the school because apparently</i>

112
00:17:12,766 --> 00:17:14,465
<i>I'm not cool.</i>

113
00:17:16,469 --> 00:17:16,467
<i>He's like, "mum, it's not
authentic if I smile."</i>

114
00:17:16,469 --> 00:17:23,307
<i>Yeah, it's your holy communion
photo, not the dogme 95 movement.</i>

115
00:17:30,305 --> 00:17:32,284
<i>My doctor actually recommended</i>

116
00:17:32,285 --> 00:17:37,688
<i>I get new contact lenses with
"hope" printed on the insides.</i>

117
00:17:37,690 --> 00:17:40,491
<i>Apparently clinical trials
suggest it may help</i>

118
00:17:40,493 --> 00:17:43,094
<i>the cynical wheel of
self-loathing from turning.</i>

119
00:17:43,529 --> 00:17:45,229
<i>I hate myself.</i>

00:17:48,234 --> 00:17:51,202
<i>Anyway, I can't wait to see you
this weekend for paddy's day.</i>

Find you a man?</i>

<i>Would you call me, you think?</i>

127
00:18:25,571 --> 00:18:28,639
I'd like you to pick
your favorite book,

128
00:18:28,641 --> 00:18:30,808
write a page about
why you like it,

129
00:18:30,810 --> 00:18:32,477
and score the book out of ten.

130
00:18:32,479 --> 00:18:34,479
Hand in date is
two weeks from today.

131
00:18:35,715 --> 00:18:38,516
Okay, everybody,
page 38, circles.

132
00:18:52,164 --> 00:18:54,665
Day 13

133
00:19:02,441 --> 00:19:04,609
fuck! Hiya, Grainne.

134
00:19:07,646 --> 00:19:08,779
What?

135
00:19:16,255 --> 00:19:17,822
Now, hang on.

136
00:19:17,824 --> 00:19:19,264
That's not very
appropriate, Grainne.

137
00:19:44,883 --> 00:19:46,350
Mrs. Cullen?

138
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:50,221
You are pregnant.

139
00:19:50,223 --> 00:19:52,490
I fucking knew it!

140
00:19:53,358 --> 00:19:55,526
I just can't believe it!

141
00:19:55,528 --> 00:19:57,595
Oh! I've waited
so long for this.

142
00:19:57,597 --> 00:20:00,865
However,
we're not certain with what.

143
00:20:00,867 --> 00:20:04,635
Well, if it's a boy or a girl,
that doesn't matter to me.

144
00:20:04,637 --> 00:20:07,438
We'd like to run
some further tests.

145
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:10,875
Although, if the results
indicate a false positive,

146
00:20:10,877 --> 00:20:14,845
we'd need to operate
immediately and remove it.

147
00:20:15,414 --> 00:20:16,781
I'm pregnant.

148
00:20:19,218 --> 00:20:20,618
Ooh.

149
00:20:20,620 --> 00:20:22,687
Did... did you understand
what I said?

150
00:20:22,689 --> 00:20:24,755
Mmm-hmm, it's totally
grand, boy or girl,

151
00:20:24,757 --> 00:20:26,357
whatever I get, I'm happy.

152
00:20:26,359 --> 00:20:27,992
I am so happy.

153
00:20:27,994 --> 00:20:31,862
Were you with somebody recently,
or some animal of some kind?

154
00:20:31,864 --> 00:20:32,930
No.

155
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:38,636
Okay, have you ever seen the
Hollywood movie <i>Rosemary's baby?</i>

156
00:20:38,638 --> 00:20:38,636
Yeah.

157
00:20:38,638 --> 00:20:42,974
If you replace '"baby"
with "reptile",

158
00:20:46,411 --> 00:20:48,346
that's what you have.

159
00:20:48,348 --> 00:20:49,647
It's like Rosemary's reptile.

160
00:20:50,415 --> 00:20:51,515
Huh?

161
00:21:08,667 --> 00:21:09,834

164
00:21:15,707 --> 00:21:16,707
Grainne, what is this?

165
00:21:19,311 --> 00:21:20,511
Grainne, what is this?

166
00:21:21,813 --> 00:21:24,015
Grainne, what is this?

167
00:21:47,506 --> 00:21:48,572
Stop smiling!

168

a mentally ill circle.</i>

<i>I'm booking an appointment
with Dublin zoo.</i>

00:22:17,036 --> 00:22:19,103
<i>There's no excuses
this time, Liz.</i>

174
00:22:37,356 --> 00:22:38,989
Hi, can I help you
with anything?

175
00:22:50,836 --> 00:22:54,438
I'm, I'm really sorry. That's
not really, that's not...

176
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:55,639
That's not really okay.

177
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:08,519
I'm sorry. I'm just going
to have to take that.

178
00:23:08,521 --> 00:23:10,388
I'm sorry. You're going
to have to leave.

179
00:23:18,260 --> 00:23:20,599
<i>What the fuck
are you thinking, Liz?</i>

180
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:25,870
<i>The zoo just called, they said you
never turned up for your appointment.</i>

181
00:23:25,872 --> 00:23:30,441
<i>I know you're probably saying to yourself,
"what if the vet's got it wrong?"</i>

182
00:23:30,443 --> 00:23:33,677
<i>Let me impart some important advice I
learned a long time ago, the hard way.</i>

183
00:23:34,546 --> 00:23:36,046
<i>Vets don't get things wrong.</i>

184
00:23:38,583 --> 00:23:41,118
<i>Giving birth to a snake
is not only suicide,</i>

185
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:44,088
<i>it's probably the most
wrong-headed thing ever attempted</i>

186
00:23:44,090 --> 00:23:47,491
<i>in the field of human endeavor.</i>

187
00:23:47,493 --> 00:23:51,829
<i>The only thing you have to do to make
our family happy is just come home.</i>

188
00:23:52,931 --> 00:23:54,098
<i>Alone.</i>

189
00:24:04,443 --> 00:24:05,743
Shh.

190
00:24:17,622 --> 00:24:18,856
Shh.

191
00:24:20,659 --> 00:24:22,560
It'll all be over soon,
I promise.

192
00:24:22,562 --> 00:24:24,595
Shh. Shh.

193
00:24:24,597 --> 00:24:26,831
I need you to help me
get clean of this, okay?

194
00:26:03,061 --> 00:26:04,261
Horrible, isn't it?

195
00:26:06,865 --> 00:26:07,865
You cannot remember.

196
00:26:09,568 --> 00:26:10,834
But you can't forget.

197
00:26:13,271 --> 00:26:16,974
Grainne, this is your father?

198
00:26:20,912 --> 00:26:22,346
Danny fucking Zucko?

199
00:26:24,883 --> 00:26:26,684
Our little boy is waiting.

200
00:26:31,289 --> 00:26:33,924
Look, I know you think she's
different, but she's not.

201
00:26:33,926 --> 00:26:36,594
She'll run a mile when
she claps eyes on him.

202
00:26:36,596 --> 00:26:38,228
Just wanted a normal baby.

203
00:26:39,130 --> 00:26:40,631
It's not fair.

204
00:26:41,066 --> 00:26:43,100
Blah blah blah.

205
00:26:43,102 --> 00:26:45,302
But just look
how quickly she forgets.

206
00:26:45,304 --> 00:26:46,904
Don't make me laugh.

207
00:26:46,906 --> 00:26:48,266
She's the same
as the rest of them.

208
00:26:52,377 --> 00:26:53,944
I'm so sorry.

209
00:26:58,183 --> 00:26:59,783
I had no idea.

210
00:27:00,619 --> 00:27:02,753
He'd be so damn ugly.

211
00:27:03,655 --> 00:27:05,623
You'd be so beautiful.

212
00:27:23,842 --> 00:27:26,377
Very good, little one.
Very good.

213
00:27:27,045 --> 00:27:28,178
Let's go!

214
00:27:30,783 --> 00:27:35,119
I bet there's a whole lotta
disenchanted folk out there

215
00:27:35,121 --> 00:27:39,123
just waiting for a bouncing snake
to lighten up their lives.

216
00:27:42,827 --> 00:27:48,065
I bet if we tap into that
lonely miserable demographic,

217
00:27:48,067 --> 00:27:51,035
in a few short years
and a bit of luck,

218
00:27:51,037 --> 00:27:53,303
we might just hit
pre-Patrick numbers.

219
00:28:03,715 --> 00:28:04,848
Oh, my beautiful baby!

220
00:28:19,330 --> 00:28:21,432
Only your deepest wish
can make me smile

221
00:28:35,914 --> 00:28:37,314
st Patrick's day greetings

222
00:28:37,316 --> 00:28:40,718
happy
St. Patrick's day

223
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:43,120
written and directed by
Gary shore

224
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:52,296
time to close your eyes
and go to sleep.

225
00:28:52,298 --> 00:28:55,733
It's a special day tomorrow.
Someone's coming tonight.

226
00:28:55,735 --> 00:28:57,334
I'll give you a hint.

227
00:28:57,336 --> 00:28:59,303
He's furry.

228
00:29:00,305 --> 00:29:01,805
And he hops.

229
00:29:03,007 --> 00:29:05,375
And you wake up in the
morning and you get...

230
00:29:06,945 --> 00:29:08,846
Candy eggs and candy chicks.

231
00:29:08,848 --> 00:29:10,914
Yes. But here's the thing.

232
00:29:10,916 --> 00:29:13,016
No kid has ever seen him.

233
00:29:13,018 --> 00:29:16,987
Because all the kids are supposed
to be asleep when he comes. Okay?

234
00:29:16,989 --> 00:29:18,522
Okay.

235
00:29:18,524 --> 00:29:20,257
Okay. Close your eyes.

236
00:29:24,229 --> 00:29:25,229
Wait.

237
00:29:26,498 --> 00:29:28,465
I'm scared.

238
00:29:28,467 --> 00:29:31,835
Why? Are you afraid you're
going to have a bad dream?

239
00:29:34,305 --> 00:29:37,007
The man coming back
from the dead.

240
00:29:37,542 --> 00:29:39,042
What man?

241
00:29:39,978 --> 00:29:42,346
Jesus.

242
00:29:42,348 --> 00:29:46,984
In church they said that Easter was
about him coming back from being dead.

243
00:29:46,986 --> 00:29:48,352
What about the Easter bunny?

244
00:29:49,521 --> 00:29:51,121
Is he dead too?

245
00:29:51,123 --> 00:29:53,056
No, the Easter bunny's
different.

246
00:29:54,392 --> 00:29:55,959
Is Jesus real?

247
00:29:56,861 --> 00:29:58,428
Yeah, he was real.

248
00:29:58,430 --> 00:30:00,497
- He was?
- Yeah.

249
00:30:00,499 --> 00:30:02,199
But he was a good man.

250
00:30:03,368 --> 00:30:05,402
And you know what?

251
00:30:05,404 --> 00:30:10,140
Yes, he died, but when he came
back, that was a good thing.

252
00:30:10,142 --> 00:30:12,976
It was a miracle
that he came back.

253
00:30:12,978 --> 00:30:18,081
He flew up into the stars and he
went back where he came from.

254
00:30:18,083 --> 00:30:19,917
And he lives in our hearts now.

255
00:30:22,387 --> 00:30:24,822
It's kind of like a scary
version of <i>e.T.</i>

256
00:30:27,126 --> 00:30:29,326
Yeah, but he wasn't a story,
he was real.

257
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:34,064
What about the Easter bunny?

258
00:30:34,066 --> 00:30:36,466
Well, the Easter bunny
comes on Easter.

259
00:30:36,468 --> 00:30:39,236
But I thought that's when
Jesus came back from the dead.

260
00:30:41,072 --> 00:30:42,105
Uh...

261
00:30:44,008 --> 00:30:45,943
No, it's... that's different.

262
00:30:45,945 --> 00:30:47,511
I don't understand, mommy.

263
00:30:47,513 --> 00:30:50,547
Oh, honey, just close your
eyes and go to sleep.

264
00:30:50,549 --> 00:30:54,084
And tomorrow you are going
to wake up and there will be

265
00:30:54,086 --> 00:30:56,086
candy chicks and eggs
and yummy stuff.

266
00:30:56,088 --> 00:30:59,056
But what if I'm awake
when he comes?

267
00:30:59,058 --> 00:31:01,225
What if I get up
and get a glass of water?

268
00:31:01,227 --> 00:31:03,393
It's okay to get
a glass of water.

269
00:31:03,395 --> 00:31:07,064
No, but what if he's here?
What if I see him?

270
00:31:07,066 --> 00:31:09,433
Shh. Honey. Just go to sleep.

271
00:31:10,501 --> 00:31:11,902
Mommy.

272
00:31:13,071 --> 00:31:14,872
How does he get in the house?

273
00:31:14,874 --> 00:31:16,039
Shh.

274
00:31:16,407 --> 00:31:17,407
Okay.

275
00:31:19,110 --> 00:31:22,312
I'm gonna count to three,
and I want those eyes shut.

276
00:31:23,448 --> 00:31:25,249
All right? One.

277
00:31:26,985 --> 00:31:28,085
Two.

278
00:31:31,356 --> 00:31:32,422
Three.

279
00:31:35,326 --> 00:31:39,296
You're going to wake up tomorrow and
it's going to be exactly like last year.

280
00:31:46,137 --> 00:31:47,337
Mommy?

281
00:31:50,241 --> 00:31:52,309
Last year, daddy was here.

282
00:31:53,278 --> 00:31:54,945
Will he ever come back?

283
00:31:58,383 --> 00:31:59,449
Maybe.

284
00:32:00,418 --> 00:32:02,085
Go to sleep, baby.

285
00:33:47,258 --> 00:33:48,325
Mommy?

286
00:36:30,788 --> 00:36:32,422
This is a dream.

287
00:36:33,624 --> 00:36:34,891
You're not real.

288
00:36:48,906 --> 00:36:50,440
Touch me.

289
00:37:23,341 --> 00:37:24,841
No child has ever seen me.

290
00:37:26,577 --> 00:37:29,646
I won't... I won't tell anyone
I saw you.

291
00:37:30,481 --> 00:37:30,480
I promise.

292
00:37:30,482 --> 00:37:34,851
But now that you've seen me.
Now it is your turn.

293
00:37:37,321 --> 00:37:38,855
You must take my place.

294
00:37:40,558 --> 00:37:42,626
Take... take your place?

295
00:37:44,262 --> 00:37:47,664
You will see things
few have ever seen.

296
00:37:50,001 --> 00:37:51,635
Magical things.

297
00:37:52,803 --> 00:37:55,405
But what if...
What if I don't want to?

298
00:37:57,308 --> 00:37:58,908
You have no choice.

299
00:38:01,979 --> 00:38:04,648
Can I... can I come back
and see my mommy?

300
00:38:08,719 --> 00:38:14,624
Where you're going, you will never
see your mommy ever, ever again.

301
00:38:39,684 --> 00:38:41,785
Now close your eyes.

302
00:39:33,704 --> 00:39:34,804
Honey?

303
00:39:36,707 --> 00:39:37,707
Honey?

304
00:39:42,147 --> 00:39:43,546
Honey?

305
00:39:51,889 --> 00:39:53,456
Best Easter wishes

306
00:39:53,458 --> 00:39:55,024
happy Easter

307
00:39:55,026 --> 00:39:59,829
written and directed by
Nicholas McCarthy

308
00:40:23,954 --> 00:40:27,590
you know, there are only a few
days in any woman's cycle

309
00:40:27,592 --> 00:40:31,094
where she's capable of
conceiving.

310
00:40:31,096 --> 00:40:34,531
And you're on,
generic high dose progestin?

311
00:40:35,900 --> 00:40:37,667
Do you take it
at the same time every day?

312
00:40:37,669 --> 00:40:39,803
Mmm-hmm.
- You're sure?

313
00:40:40,438 --> 00:40:41,938
He wears two condoms.

314
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:43,907
Hmm?

315
00:40:43,909 --> 00:40:47,544
I ask him to wear two condoms.
Sometimes three.

316
00:41:00,958 --> 00:41:04,194
And you've terminated
nearly 20 pregnancies?

317
00:41:04,196 --> 00:41:05,662
I've stopped counting.

318
00:41:06,597 --> 00:41:08,465
- I'm sorry, I...
- It's okay.

319
00:41:08,467 --> 00:41:10,733
I've been to see
so many doctors.

320
00:41:10,735 --> 00:41:12,836
My family won't talk to me.

321
00:41:13,971 --> 00:41:17,640
My friends think I'm insane,

322
00:41:17,642 --> 00:41:19,576
or making it up, or just...

323
00:41:25,015 --> 00:41:26,516
It's...

324
00:41:30,521 --> 00:41:32,155
It's like I'm cursed.

325
00:41:36,126 --> 00:41:38,595
I don't usually do this.

326
00:41:38,597 --> 00:41:42,232
But it does feel like you've
exhausted all other options.

327
00:41:42,234 --> 00:41:45,134
I'm going to give you
my sister's phone number.

328
00:41:45,136 --> 00:41:51,107
She volunteers at these weekend fertility
ceremonies in the high desert.

329
00:41:51,109 --> 00:41:55,512
Maybe she can give you some sort of insight
that the rest of us haven't been able to.

330
00:41:55,514 --> 00:41:57,213
Thank you. Thank you.

331
00:41:59,149 --> 00:42:02,719
It's probably not for me,
but I appreciate it.

332
00:42:02,721 --> 00:42:05,622
Kate, if what
you've told me is true

333
00:42:05,624 --> 00:42:08,658
then I don't think conventional
medicine can help you.

334
00:42:19,904 --> 00:42:22,105
<i>What happens at the ceremony?</i>

335
00:42:22,107 --> 00:42:26,175
<i>Well, um, have you ever
participated in a peyote ceremony</i>

336
00:42:26,177 --> 00:42:30,013
<i>or ayahuasca, or any
kind of ceremonial medicine?</i>

337
00:42:30,015 --> 00:42:30,013
<i>Well, no.</i>

338
00:42:30,015 --> 00:42:33,550
<i>It can be an intense experience.</i>

339
00:42:33,552 --> 00:42:39,989
<i>Um, but if you're open to it, I think
that you can really learn something.</i>

340
00:42:47,865 --> 00:42:49,866
I know I'm going to get
pregnant this time.

341
00:42:49,868 --> 00:42:52,835
I know it. I know it.
Sometimes it takes many times

342
00:42:52,837 --> 00:42:54,270
to come here before you do.

343
00:42:54,272 --> 00:42:56,306
I think you have
to let go of the trying.

344
00:42:56,308 --> 00:42:58,341
Yeah, I get nervous sometimes.

345
00:42:58,343 --> 00:43:01,878
Make yourself at home. The
ceremony will start in an hour.

346
00:43:06,684 --> 00:43:08,051
How old are you?

347
00:43:08,053 --> 00:43:09,352
Twenty-four.

348
00:43:09,354 --> 00:43:11,154
What's the rush?

349
00:43:11,156 --> 00:43:14,057
I'm actually not trying
to have a baby right now.

350
00:43:14,059 --> 00:43:15,224
Then what are you doing here?

351
00:43:16,894 --> 00:43:19,095
I get pregnant
every time I have sex.

352
00:43:21,298 --> 00:43:22,298
Sounds rough.

353
00:45:00,397 --> 00:45:03,433
No. No. No. No.

354
00:45:03,435 --> 00:45:09,038
You are a gateway.

355
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:13,309
No, I have to go home.
No, I have to get out of here.

356
00:45:16,147 --> 00:45:18,781
No, I have to go home.
No, I don't want to be here.

357
00:45:18,783 --> 00:45:23,886
It's just the medicine. Trust it.
It's just the medicine.

358
00:45:31,262 --> 00:45:33,930
Every time you end
the life inside of you,

359
00:45:33,932 --> 00:45:35,965
it will come back stronger.

360
00:46:51,309 --> 00:46:52,875
Sleep

361
00:46:52,877 --> 00:46:54,076
sleep, little bird

362
00:46:55,312 --> 00:46:57,013
when the time comes

363
00:46:57,015 --> 00:46:58,114
do not resist

364
00:46:58,582 --> 00:47:00,917
do not say no

365
00:48:10,187 --> 00:48:12,221
good morning, sleepyhead.

366
00:48:13,957 --> 00:48:15,992
Do you want a bath today?

367
00:48:17,394 --> 00:48:18,394
Yeah.

368
00:48:19,897 --> 00:48:21,097
Okay.

369
00:48:22,466 --> 00:48:26,335
One, two, three, up.

370
00:48:28,472 --> 00:48:30,072
Okay.

371
00:48:41,318 --> 00:48:43,419
You're gonna be
such a good mama.

372
00:48:45,088 --> 00:48:46,622
You've been very patient.

373
00:49:03,273 --> 00:49:05,608
I think we need to
increase her dose.

374
00:49:05,610 --> 00:49:08,644
No, we can't give her
more than three drops.

375
00:49:08,646 --> 00:49:10,579
It's not good for the baby.

376
00:49:13,250 --> 00:49:15,251
Lily, she's fine.

377
00:49:15,253 --> 00:49:16,953
- Morning.
- Sister.

378
00:49:19,156 --> 00:49:21,190
Started getting
so hot out there.

379
00:49:21,192 --> 00:49:23,025
Yeah, it always heats up in may.

380
00:49:24,494 --> 00:49:27,697
Happy mother's day, mama.
We're almost there.

381
00:49:40,243 --> 00:49:43,479
Blood pressure is a little high.

382
00:49:43,481 --> 00:49:44,881
Has anybody tried
calling her phone?

383
00:49:45,349 --> 00:49:47,016
No, poor girl.

384
00:49:47,018 --> 00:49:48,751
How's she been this week?

385
00:49:48,753 --> 00:49:52,555
Not so good. I mean, we could
use you around here more often.

386
00:49:52,557 --> 00:49:54,323
Well, I can't spend all
my time out here,

387
00:49:54,325 --> 00:49:54,323
I'm going back and forth
enough as it is.

388
00:49:54,325 --> 00:49:58,260
Well, you don't know what it's like here.
It's really hard.

389
00:49:58,262 --> 00:50:00,262
I am here every weekend.
I'm going back and forth.

390
00:50:00,264 --> 00:50:01,764
Yeah, well, I think you should
stay with her from here on out.

391
00:50:01,766 --> 00:50:03,299
It's the last month.

392
00:50:03,301 --> 00:50:05,061
I can't take a whole month
off of work, Lily.

393
00:50:06,070 --> 00:50:07,370
God damn it, you idiot!

394
00:50:07,372 --> 00:50:09,372
Don't yell at her.

395
00:50:09,374 --> 00:50:11,640
No wonder she has high blood
pressure, living here with you guys.

396
00:50:11,642 --> 00:50:13,442
She can't hear us anyways.

397
00:50:13,444 --> 00:50:15,578
It's okay. Come on.
Come with me. Come on.

398
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:24,653
Okay.

399
00:50:28,325 --> 00:50:30,326
Classical or contemporary today?

400
00:50:31,328 --> 00:50:33,362
I'm feeling contemporary.

401
00:51:06,497 --> 00:51:08,497
<i>911, what's your emergency?</i>

402
00:51:08,499 --> 00:51:12,368
My name is Kate Polson.

403
00:51:14,071 --> 00:51:18,441
I'm... I've been kidnapped.

404
00:51:18,443 --> 00:51:20,776
<i>I can't hear you, miss,
can you speak up?</i>

405
00:51:20,778 --> 00:51:22,845
I need help.

406
00:51:22,847 --> 00:51:24,780
<i>Fire, ambulance, or police?</i>

407
00:51:24,782 --> 00:51:27,550
Police, please. Please hurry.

408
00:51:29,119 --> 00:51:30,519
<i>What's the address?</i>

409
00:51:31,555 --> 00:51:34,623
Oh. Um...

410
00:51:34,625 --> 00:51:39,228
It's like, it's a house. Um, ten
miles north of the highway.

411
00:51:39,230 --> 00:51:40,696
It's a... ah!

412
00:51:45,168 --> 00:51:46,402
Oh, god!

413
00:51:54,711 --> 00:51:56,178
Be careful.

414
00:51:57,247 --> 00:51:58,481
- Careful!

415
00:52:01,718 --> 00:52:04,487
That was stupid, look what you did!
What's happening?

416
00:52:04,489 --> 00:52:06,522
She's going in to labor,
that's what's happening.

417
00:52:06,524 --> 00:52:08,457
God. Okay.

418
00:52:08,459 --> 00:52:10,726
Just breathe.
Just breathe.

419
00:52:12,562 --> 00:52:14,597
The more you accept it,
the easier it will be.

420
00:52:17,135 --> 00:52:19,635
All right, come on,
just push. Push for me.

421
00:52:23,173 --> 00:52:24,740
- Good girl.

422
00:52:24,742 --> 00:52:29,378
Push, Kate. Push.
Almost there, almost there.

423
00:52:38,155 --> 00:52:40,723
Dearest mother

424
00:52:40,725 --> 00:52:42,391
happy mother's day

425
00:52:42,393 --> 00:52:47,163
written and directed by
Sarah Adina Smith

426
00:53:20,797 --> 00:53:22,698
probably not.

427
00:53:22,700 --> 00:53:25,467
Yeah, I'm going to be here grading
these papers all weekend.

428
00:53:27,504 --> 00:53:29,705
Yeah, I know, it's 52 this year.

429
00:53:54,297 --> 00:53:56,599
Happy father's day

430
00:54:48,785 --> 00:54:50,052
<i>hi, Carol.</i>

431
00:54:51,888 --> 00:54:54,623
<i>It's me. Your daddy.</i>

432
00:54:57,594 --> 00:55:00,729
<i>I'm so sorry.
Daddy had to leave you.</i>

433
00:55:02,565 --> 00:55:05,401
<i>I never loved anything
more than you.</i>

434
00:55:08,672 --> 00:55:10,539
<i>You were my miracle.</i>

435
00:55:11,708 --> 00:55:14,643
<i>I wanted so badly
for you to come with me.</i>

436
00:55:16,546 --> 00:55:18,480
<i>For us to be together.</i>

437
00:55:20,684 --> 00:55:23,319
<i>Your mother and I,</i>

438
00:55:23,321 --> 00:55:25,888
<i>we just didn't see things
the same way.</i>

439
00:55:27,857 --> 00:55:32,494
<i>It's so important that
you know it wasn't your fault.</i>

440
00:55:33,396 --> 00:55:36,098
<i>And that you know that I am</i>

441
00:55:36,100 --> 00:55:40,803
<i>so, so sorry
I wasn't there for you.</i>

442
00:55:48,445 --> 00:55:50,679
<i>If you're hearing this message,</i>

443
00:55:50,681 --> 00:55:53,649
<i>I, I can't imagine the pain</i>

444
00:55:54,484 --> 00:55:57,052
<i>that I've caused you.</i>

445
00:55:57,054 --> 00:56:00,823
<i>But it's not too late
for us to be together.</i>

446
00:56:02,792 --> 00:56:06,595
<i>I left this message in trust
with good people.</i>

447
00:56:06,597 --> 00:56:09,665
<i>I told them to give this to
you when you were old enough,</i>

448
00:56:10,767 --> 00:56:13,469
<i>strong enough.</i>

449
00:56:13,471 --> 00:56:15,971
<i>I didn't want
to leave you there all alone.</i>

450
00:56:17,907 --> 00:56:19,742
<i>It wasn't my choice.</i>

451
00:56:21,077 --> 00:56:24,012
<i>So, if you want to see me,</i>

452
00:56:24,647 --> 00:56:26,482
<i>to find me,</i>

453
00:56:26,484 --> 00:56:29,151
<i>continue where we left off,</i>

454
00:56:29,153 --> 00:56:32,621
<i>I can be there for you now.
If you're ready.</i>

455
00:56:33,890 --> 00:56:36,658
<i>Just go to where
we played that day,</i>

456
00:56:36,660 --> 00:56:38,961
<i>our last day together.</i>

457
00:56:38,963 --> 00:56:42,831
<i>Go there, turn the tape over,</i>

458
00:56:42,833 --> 00:56:45,868
<i>press play and I will guide you.</i>

459
00:56:47,804 --> 00:56:51,173
<i>You will always be my baby,
no matter what you choose.</i>

460
00:56:51,175 --> 00:56:54,810
<i>I just hope you'll have
it in you to forgive me.</i>

461
00:56:55,979 --> 00:56:59,648
<i>Remember, daddy loves you
forever, Carol.</i>

462
00:57:03,954 --> 00:57:08,056
This isn't fair.
This isn't fucking fair.

463
00:57:10,127 --> 00:57:12,194
How could you
do this to me, mom?

464
00:57:13,596 --> 00:57:17,433
All these years?
He was alive?

465
00:57:17,435 --> 00:57:19,034
I missed him so much.

466
00:57:21,504 --> 00:57:23,972
You fucking call me back
the minute you get this.

467
00:57:25,108 --> 00:57:26,508
Bitch!

468
00:58:50,593 --> 00:58:53,829
<i>Carol! Come on, baby,
it's time to go!</i>

469
00:58:53,831 --> 00:58:53,829
<i>Five more minutes?</i>

470
00:58:53,831 --> 00:58:58,300
<i>Okay, five more minutes,
then we have to go.</i>

471
00:58:58,302 --> 00:58:59,701
<i>Okay!</i>

472
00:59:02,171 --> 00:59:04,540
<i>Hello, Carol.</i>

473
00:59:04,542 --> 00:59:08,110
<i>I hope that you've come,
and are ready to see me again.</i>

474
00:59:08,112 --> 00:59:11,847
<i>Listen carefully,
and I'll help you find me.</i>

475
00:59:11,849 --> 00:59:11,847
<i>I'm ready, daddy.</i>

476
00:59:11,849 --> 00:59:15,951
<i>Yeah, okay,
you got your backpack?</i>

477
00:59:15,953 --> 00:59:16,953
<i>Yeah.</i>

478
00:59:19,055 --> 00:59:21,990
<i>Hey, let's go
this way today, okay?</i>

479
00:59:21,992 --> 00:59:24,126
<i>Where are we going?</i>

480
00:59:24,128 --> 00:59:26,895
<i>First we're going
towards the exit.</i>

481
00:59:26,897 --> 00:59:30,232
<i>Then we are headed south,
on Revelle Avenue.</i>

482
00:59:30,234 --> 00:59:32,968
<i>South? Where's south?</i>

483
00:59:32,970 --> 00:59:34,803
<i>It's this way.</i>

484
00:59:34,805 --> 00:59:36,939
<i>Come, let's hold hands
while crossing.</i>

485
00:59:40,877 --> 00:59:43,245
<i>How come you're carrying that?</i>

486
00:59:43,247 --> 00:59:45,714
<i>I'm making a message
for a friend.</i>

487
00:59:46,716 --> 00:59:47,883
<i>Do I know them?</i>

488
00:59:49,052 --> 00:59:50,919
<i>Yes, honey.
You know them.</i>

489
00:59:52,755 --> 00:59:54,723
<i>Turn right on third.</i>

490
00:59:54,725 --> 00:59:54,723
Third st Revelle ave

491
00:59:54,725 --> 00:59:57,326
<i>what's it say?</i>

492
00:59:57,328 --> 00:59:59,227
<i>Just where to find us.</i>

493
01:00:00,663 --> 01:00:01,663
<i>Why?</i>

494
01:00:02,865 --> 01:00:03,865
<i>Because they need help.</i>

495
01:00:10,206 --> 01:00:12,608
<i>Look at this, dad!</i>

496
01:00:12,610 --> 01:00:14,776
<i>Wow,
that's a good looking stick.</i>

497
01:00:14,778 --> 01:00:17,379
<i>It looks like a magic wand.</i>

498
01:00:18,381 --> 01:00:19,982
<i>It does look magic.</i>

499
01:00:27,090 --> 01:00:29,291
<i>- How much further?
- We're almost there.</i>

500
01:00:30,727 --> 01:00:34,396
<i>Go left at Marmont coming up.</i>

501
01:00:34,398 --> 01:00:37,299
<i>I promise this will
all make sense in the end.</i>

502
01:00:39,669 --> 01:00:43,071
<i>Walk to 433 Marmont.</i>

503
01:00:45,642 --> 01:00:48,143
<i>You know that I love you
very much, right?</i>

504
01:00:49,212 --> 01:00:51,380
<i>I love you too, daddy.</i>

505
01:00:51,382 --> 01:00:54,750
<i>And that I only want
what is best for us.</i>

506
01:00:54,752 --> 01:00:57,285
<i>That's why I picked
you up today, honey.</i>

507
01:00:57,287 --> 01:01:00,022
<i>Daddy has to go somewhere</i>

508
01:01:00,024 --> 01:01:03,158
<i>and I needed to see you
before I left.</i>

509
01:01:03,160 --> 01:01:04,926
<i>Where are you going?</i>

510
01:01:04,928 --> 01:01:08,363
<i>I'm going to
a very special place.</i>

511
01:01:08,365 --> 01:01:11,833
<i>But don't worry,
you'll come and visit me soon.</i>

512
01:01:11,835 --> 01:01:14,336
<i>Always remember this, Carol,</i>

513
01:01:14,338 --> 01:01:16,938
<i>the person who risks nothing,</i>

514
01:01:16,940 --> 01:01:19,374
<i>has nothing, is nothing,</i>

515
01:01:20,143 --> 01:01:22,310
<i>and becomes nothing.</i>

516
01:01:22,312 --> 01:01:24,346
<i>I don't want you to go.</i>

517
01:01:24,348 --> 01:01:25,380
<i>I know.</i>

518
01:01:26,716 --> 01:01:27,916
<i>But I have to.</i>

519
01:01:29,986 --> 01:01:31,153
<i>We're here.</i>

520
01:01:32,355 --> 01:01:34,222
<i>The front door should be open.</i>

521
01:01:36,793 --> 01:01:40,062
<i>You'll come see me
as soon as you're ready.</i>

522
01:01:40,064 --> 01:01:42,364
<i>- I'm ready.
- I wish you were.</i>

523
01:01:44,300 --> 01:01:46,201
<i>But I'll miss you.</i>

524
01:01:46,203 --> 01:01:48,470
<i>I'll miss you more
than you'll ever know.</i>

525
01:01:51,174 --> 01:01:53,175
<i>Come, we have to go inside.</i>

526
01:01:54,444 --> 01:01:56,344
<i>Here, let daddy carry you.</i>

527
01:02:08,991 --> 01:02:10,926
<i>Why do you have to go?</i>

528
01:02:11,928 --> 01:02:13,829
<i>Be strong for daddy.</i>

529
01:02:16,065 --> 01:02:17,225
<i>We're almost together again.</i>

530
01:02:20,136 --> 01:02:21,203
<i>You are so close now.</i>

531
01:02:23,372 --> 01:02:25,273
<i>What's that picture?</i>

532
01:02:26,442 --> 01:02:28,043
<i>It's called an icon.</i>

533
01:02:28,945 --> 01:02:30,846
<i>It's a symbol of faith.</i>

534
01:02:40,289 --> 01:02:42,491
<i>Okay, honey, will you sit here
and wait for daddy?</i>

535
01:02:44,193 --> 01:02:47,395
<i>I have to go talk
to that nice lady over there.</i>

536
01:02:47,397 --> 01:02:48,497
<i>You're not going yet, are you?</i>

537
01:02:48,499 --> 01:02:50,031
<i>Not yet.</i>

538
01:02:50,033 --> 01:02:52,968
<i>I just need to talk to the lady.</i>

539
01:02:52,970 --> 01:02:56,104
<i>- Promise?
- I promise.</i>

540
01:02:56,106 --> 01:02:56,104
<i>Okay.</i>

541
01:02:56,106 --> 01:03:01,243
<i>Hey, you're such a strong girl,
and I am so proud of you.</i>

542
01:03:09,318 --> 01:03:12,087
<i>I'm here for my appointment,
to speak with you.</i>

543
01:03:26,903 --> 01:03:28,103
<i>Thank you.</i>

544
01:03:29,372 --> 01:03:31,506
<i>Once I go,</i>

545
01:03:31,508 --> 01:03:34,309
<i>will you make sure
that she's taken care of?</i>

546
01:03:37,146 --> 01:03:39,247
<i>Dad! Dad!</i>

547
01:03:40,583 --> 01:03:43,051
<i>Dad! Dad!</i>

548
01:03:43,053 --> 01:03:44,386
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

549
01:03:44,388 --> 01:03:47,122
<i>Daddy! Daddy!</i>

550
01:03:54,130 --> 01:03:56,131
<i>It wasn't my choice, Carol.</i>

551
01:03:57,300 --> 01:03:59,301
<i>You...</i>

552
01:03:59,303 --> 01:04:03,171
<i>You only get once chance
to meet him,</i>

553
01:04:03,840 --> 01:04:04,906
<i>to visit this place.</i>

554
01:04:07,443 --> 01:04:09,544
<i>That's why I made this for you,</i>

555
01:04:10,980 --> 01:04:13,381
<i>and I pray that it found you,</i>

556
01:04:15,184 --> 01:04:17,185
<i>so that you may find me.</i>

557
01:04:27,230 --> 01:04:29,164
<i>I'll be so happy
to see you again.</i>

558
01:04:33,336 --> 01:04:35,237
<i>It will have been so long.</i>

559
01:04:37,340 --> 01:04:38,340
Dad?

560
01:04:40,244 --> 01:04:42,310
Mom

561
01:04:48,484 --> 01:04:50,252
daddy?

562
01:04:50,254 --> 01:04:51,920
<i>Hello, baby.</i>

563
01:04:53,289 --> 01:04:55,590
<i>I'm here for you.</i>

564
01:04:55,592 --> 01:04:59,060
<i>- I'm so happy that you came.</i>
- Dad!

565
01:04:59,062 --> 01:05:01,563
<i>Daddy loves you so much, Carol.</i>

566
01:05:02,498 --> 01:05:05,233
<i>I'm so proud of you.</i>

567
01:05:05,235 --> 01:05:11,172
<i>If you have come, and you have
found me, then you are here.</i>

568
01:05:11,174 --> 01:05:13,475
<i>- You're finally here...</i>
- Daddy, it's me.

569
01:05:13,477 --> 01:05:15,377
<i>...in this room,</i>

570
01:05:15,379 --> 01:05:19,214
<i>- of your own free will.</i>
- Please, daddy.

571
01:05:19,216 --> 01:05:24,286
<i>Oh, Carol, that means that you,
and I, can be together again.</i>

572
01:05:35,364 --> 01:05:36,531
<i>Together.</i>

573
01:06:02,992 --> 01:06:06,394
To my dear father

574
01:06:06,396 --> 01:06:08,129
happy father's day

Anthony Scott burns

576
01:06:18,040 --> 01:06:20,408
hi, is this Shelby?

577
01:06:20,410 --> 01:06:22,310
Yeah, you responded
to my ad online.

578
01:06:23,012 --> 01:06:25,213
My name's Ian.
How are you?

579
01:06:25,982 --> 01:06:27,048
Pussy Haver

580
01:06:27,050 --> 01:06:29,050
where are you from, by the way?

581
01:06:29,052 --> 01:06:31,519
Des moines! Oh, fuck.

582
01:06:31,521 --> 01:06:33,722
You probably want
to get out of there so badly.

583
01:06:34,724 --> 01:06:37,092
Yeah, so come to la.

584
01:06:37,094 --> 01:06:40,195
No, it's not porn.
It's webcam.

585
01:06:40,197 --> 01:06:42,764
It's honestly exactly like
facetime.

586
01:06:42,766 --> 01:06:45,200
You probably already do the
same shit with your boyfriends.

587
01:06:45,202 --> 01:06:48,536
Except now, you can get paid
while you do it. Large.

588
01:06:48,538 --> 01:06:48,536
Discount candy 3 for $1

589
01:06:48,538 --> 01:06:51,740
last week one of the girls
made eight grand.

590
01:06:51,742 --> 01:06:53,408
How's it sound to you?

591
01:06:55,077 --> 01:06:58,546
Good? Oh, that's amazing!

592
01:06:58,548 --> 01:07:01,316
That's amazing!
I'm super excited about that.

593
01:07:01,318 --> 01:07:01,316
Haver of pussy

594
01:07:01,318 --> 01:07:04,386
okay, so we'll get everything
squared away immediately.

595
01:07:04,388 --> 01:07:06,421
Hi, is this Allison?

596
01:07:06,423 --> 01:07:08,490
Yeah, you responded
to my ad online.

597
01:07:08,492 --> 01:07:10,792
Yeah, the webcam stuff.

598
01:07:10,794 --> 01:07:13,194
No, no, no, no,
it's nothing like porno.

599
01:07:13,196 --> 01:07:15,263
It's nothing like porno at all.

600
01:07:15,265 --> 01:07:18,099
It's on your webcam.
It's pretty much facetime.

601
01:07:18,101 --> 01:07:21,770
I mean, you probably already do the
same thing with your boyfriends.

602
01:07:21,772 --> 01:07:25,473
Yeah. It includes a free ticket
to the heart of Hollywood.

603
01:07:25,475 --> 01:07:27,542
You'll be set up, staying in
a beautiful apartment.

604
01:07:28,711 --> 01:07:30,412
What do you tell your parents?

605
01:07:30,414 --> 01:07:32,514
I don't know.
Fuck your parents.

606
01:07:34,451 --> 01:07:38,420
<i>Stirring our cauldron
of magic are we!</i>

607
01:07:38,422 --> 01:07:42,457
<i>A witch's power
is strongest in threes.</i>

608
01:07:44,394 --> 01:07:47,762
Like, what the fuck are
these bitches cooking, man?

609
01:07:47,764 --> 01:07:49,764
They're not cooking.

610
01:07:49,766 --> 01:07:52,500
That's a cauldron. They're
actually casting spells.

611
01:07:56,372 --> 01:07:58,273
I just had a fucking asshole.

612
01:07:58,275 --> 01:07:59,507
What happened?

613
01:08:02,111 --> 01:08:04,479
<i>He was writing all this shit
that he wanted to do to me.</i>

614
01:08:04,481 --> 01:08:04,479
I will cum in Ur face bb

615
01:08:04,481 --> 01:08:07,182
<i>- -and then when

01:08:08,251 --> 01:08:09,517

617
01:08:09,519 --> 01:08:10,718
...he called me a whore!

618
01:08:10,720 --> 01:08:14,522
Aw, Serenes. I'm so sorry.

619
01:08:14,524 --> 01:08:17,125
Man, what a fucking
fuckhole, man.

620
01:08:17,127 --> 01:08:19,561
You got his credit card
number, right?

621
01:08:19,563 --> 01:08:22,163
- So, fuck this asshole,
let's go shopping.

622
01:08:23,599 --> 01:08:25,433
I can e-mail you
a ticket right away, Allison.

623
01:08:27,403 --> 01:08:29,604
Your boyfriend? Ah, fuck him.

624
01:08:29,606 --> 01:08:31,873
No, you'll be treated like a queen here.
I promise.

625
01:08:33,676 --> 01:08:36,111
Okay. Bye now.

626
01:08:40,683 --> 01:08:42,750
The fuck is this?

627
01:08:42,752 --> 01:08:44,285
Nobody's working?

628
01:08:44,287 --> 01:08:45,787
Nobody's calling.

629
01:08:45,789 --> 01:08:47,856
It's Halloween.
Everyone's out partying.

630
01:08:47,858 --> 01:08:49,491
Except us.

631
01:08:49,725 --> 01:08:51,459
Aw. That's sad.

632
01:08:51,827 --> 01:08:53,495
Trick or treat, skank.

633
01:09:00,436 --> 01:09:02,670
Did you scrape
that shit out yet?

634
01:09:02,672 --> 01:09:04,372
I want to eat my hot pockets.

635
01:09:04,374 --> 01:09:06,641
Can I have
one of your hot pockets?

636
01:09:06,643 --> 01:09:08,643
I gave you your dinner.

637
01:09:08,645 --> 01:09:11,579
Fuck your three for a dollar
discount shit.

638
01:09:11,581 --> 01:09:13,181
What's wrong
with name brand candy,

639
01:09:13,183 --> 01:09:14,482
you ever heard of Hersheys?

640
01:09:15,651 --> 01:09:18,553
Yeah, I heard of Hershey.

641
01:09:18,555 --> 01:09:23,525
Hersheys is what my grandmother
used to say, is for ladies.

642
01:09:23,527 --> 01:09:27,762
I added this part.
Discount stuff is for whores.

643
01:09:27,764 --> 01:09:29,430
Whores!

644
01:09:29,432 --> 01:09:31,332
What is wrong with this girl?

645
01:09:31,334 --> 01:09:35,537
Some cam asshole called her
a whore and then signed off.

646
01:09:35,539 --> 01:09:37,739
They're supposed
to type dirty shit.

647
01:09:37,741 --> 01:09:39,641
That's why they give us
their money.

648
01:09:39,643 --> 01:09:42,510
Okay, well nobody's giving us
their money tonight.

649
01:09:42,512 --> 01:09:44,479
Yeah, so why don't
you give us the night off

650
01:09:44,481 --> 01:09:47,582
so we can cheer Serena up
and celebrate Halloween?

651
01:09:50,953 --> 01:09:52,253
Okay.

652
01:09:54,223 --> 01:09:55,924
Oh no, wait. Wait.

653
01:09:55,926 --> 01:09:57,859
I meant to say, fuck no.

654
01:09:57,861 --> 01:09:59,494
Don't be a dick, Ian.

655
01:09:59,496 --> 01:10:02,330
No, fuck you, Holly.
I'm sick of your shit.

656
01:10:02,332 --> 01:10:04,866
I'm sick of
all of your shits, okay?

657
01:10:04,868 --> 01:10:07,302
I just got off the phone
with two...

658
01:10:07,304 --> 01:10:10,838
Two. Count 'em.
Two cam girls.

659
01:10:10,840 --> 01:10:15,310
Oh, yeah. They want to come to
Hollywood, and work for me.

660
01:10:15,312 --> 01:10:16,978
So, a.B.C.

661
01:10:16,980 --> 01:10:18,246
Ian's rules

662
01:10:18,248 --> 01:10:19,314
(1) Abc - always be caming

663
01:10:19,316 --> 01:10:22,350
always be camming, bitches.

664
01:10:22,352 --> 01:10:24,385
'Cause the next
generation's coming,

665
01:10:24,387 --> 01:10:26,321
and they're going
to replace you.

666
01:10:26,323 --> 01:10:29,657
Just like you replaced
the whores before you.

667
01:10:29,659 --> 01:10:31,259
Stop saying "whores"!

668
01:10:31,261 --> 01:10:33,141
No! I'll say "whores"
if I want to say "whores"!

669
01:10:33,862 --> 01:10:35,496
I'll say "whores" if I want.

670
01:10:36,565 --> 01:10:37,966
Now you got me irritated.

671
01:10:41,971 --> 01:10:44,339
And since it's such
a slow night,

672
01:10:45,808 --> 01:10:48,409
why don't I put
one of you sluts to work?

673
01:10:48,411 --> 01:10:49,611
Hmm, how does that sound?

674
01:10:51,013 --> 01:10:53,014
So who's it going to be?

675
01:10:53,016 --> 01:10:54,896
One of you girls is going
to show me your pussy.

676
01:10:58,554 --> 01:10:59,554
No.

677
01:11:00,990 --> 01:11:03,625
We're not girls, Ian.
We're women.

678
01:11:03,627 --> 01:11:06,828
I was a girl when I got here,

679
01:11:06,830 --> 01:11:09,530
but after working for you
for eight fucking months,

680
01:11:09,532 --> 01:11:12,300
now I'm sad to say, I'm a woman.

681
01:11:12,302 --> 01:11:15,270
I'm the oldest
18-year old woman I know.

682
01:11:15,272 --> 01:11:18,039
All because I made
a big mistake in coming here.

683
01:11:18,941 --> 01:11:20,775
But you know what?

684
01:11:20,777 --> 01:11:23,911
The more I think about it,
the more I realize

685
01:11:23,913 --> 01:11:27,482
I'm not the only one that
made the mistake, Ian.

686
01:11:27,484 --> 01:11:29,817
You made a big mistake.

687
01:11:31,353 --> 01:11:33,421
Wanna know why?

688
01:11:33,423 --> 01:11:36,958
Because you put three women
in a room together.

689
01:11:36,960 --> 01:11:39,427
Do you know what three
women in a room together

690
01:11:39,429 --> 01:11:40,895
used to be called?

691
01:11:40,897 --> 01:11:42,063
A coven.

692
01:11:42,665 --> 01:11:43,965
You got that?

693
01:11:43,967 --> 01:11:44,967
Witches.

694
01:11:46,969 --> 01:11:50,438
And the power of witches
is always strongest in threes.

695
01:11:50,440 --> 01:11:52,607
- You fuck.

696
01:11:53,075 --> 01:11:54,676
Oh.

697
01:11:54,678 --> 01:11:56,311
Witches, now?

698
01:11:56,979 --> 01:11:59,580
Witches. Okay.

699
01:11:59,582 --> 01:12:05,053
Well, which witch is going
to ride this broomstick?

700
01:12:08,791 --> 01:12:10,358
Yeah.

701
01:12:11,794 --> 01:12:13,027
- This one.
- No.

702
01:12:13,029 --> 01:12:13,961
- Yes.
- No!

703
01:12:13,963 --> 01:12:15,363
Yes!

704
01:12:15,365 --> 01:12:17,398
No! I don't wanna!

705
01:12:17,400 --> 01:12:18,833
Well, you're gonna!

706
01:12:45,394 --> 01:12:46,728
Oh. What the fuck?

707
01:12:47,363 --> 01:12:48,696
Ow!

708
01:12:51,967 --> 01:12:53,701
Oh, you fucking bitch.

709
01:12:55,437 --> 01:12:57,872
The fuck is this shit?

710
01:12:58,774 --> 01:12:59,774
Ow!

711
01:13:01,410 --> 01:13:02,910
What the fuck is this?

712
01:13:04,046 --> 01:13:05,813
What the fuck?

713
01:13:07,149 --> 01:13:08,983
What the fuck?

714
01:13:21,397 --> 01:13:22,997
What the fuck.

715
01:13:24,501 --> 01:13:25,666
- What the fuck.

716
01:13:32,074 --> 01:13:34,442
What the fuck.

717
01:13:34,444 --> 01:13:36,778
You feel that, Ian? We stuck
a vibrator up your ass.

718
01:13:36,780 --> 01:13:39,013
And super-glued your asshole shut.
And hooked the vibrator up

719
01:13:39,015 --> 01:13:40,515
to a car battery.

720
01:13:40,883 --> 01:13:42,083
What the fuck?

721
01:13:44,554 --> 01:13:46,421
Smelly work,
but it was worth it!

722
01:13:46,423 --> 01:13:47,955
So we can do this...

723
01:13:56,131 --> 01:13:57,632
Ow.

724
01:13:59,802 --> 01:14:00,922
If you try pull it out again

725
01:14:03,472 --> 01:14:05,440
what the fuck!

726
01:14:05,442 --> 01:14:08,476
We'll crank it up higher.
Like this...

727
01:14:12,181 --> 01:14:14,715
Okay! Okay! Okay!

728
01:14:16,452 --> 01:14:17,518
Now...

729
01:14:21,056 --> 01:14:22,457
Ah.

730
01:14:25,127 --> 01:14:26,861
What the fuck do you want?

731
01:14:27,930 --> 01:14:28,930
Show us your pussy.

732
01:14:29,598 --> 01:14:32,133
What? What the fuck!

733
01:14:32,135 --> 01:14:33,201
Show us your pussy now!

734
01:14:38,507 --> 01:14:41,008
Oh, fuck, okay, okay!

735
01:14:44,880 --> 01:14:45,880
Okay!

736
01:14:50,652 --> 01:14:52,119
There!

737
01:14:52,121 --> 01:14:54,622
You made your point,
take your fucking pictures!

738
01:14:58,994 --> 01:15:00,962
Show us your pussy, Ian.

739
01:15:03,131 --> 01:15:04,699
What the fuck?

740
01:15:05,534 --> 01:15:07,502
I don't have a pussy!

741
01:15:07,504 --> 01:15:09,637
I don't have a pussy!

742
01:15:09,639 --> 01:15:11,506
So make one.

743
01:15:19,648 --> 01:15:22,783
Are you fucking bitches
fucked in the head?

744
01:15:22,785 --> 01:15:24,218
What the fuck is wrong with you?

745
01:15:24,220 --> 01:15:26,888
This is fucking insane!

746
01:15:26,890 --> 01:15:28,256
Do it bb. Show us your pussy

747
01:15:32,995 --> 01:15:33,895
or we turn it up!
You've been at a 1.

748
01:15:33,897 --> 01:15:35,663
This is a 2.

749
01:15:36,899 --> 01:15:39,767
Fuck you!
Fuck you! Fuck you!

750
01:15:40,969 --> 01:15:42,103
Fuck you!

751
01:15:48,176 --> 01:15:50,711
Okay, Ian - that was just a 2.
Of a possible 10.

752
01:15:51,813 --> 01:15:54,849
So, y'know...

753
01:15:54,851 --> 01:15:56,617
Show us your pussy, Ian.

754
01:15:56,619 --> 01:15:58,085
Please don't make me do this.
Please.

755
01:15:58,155 --> 01:15:59,054
Use the knife.

756
01:15:59,055 --> 01:16:01,689
I'll pay you.
I'll fucking pay you, please!

757
01:16:07,563 --> 01:16:10,698
Oh, fuck, okay, okay!

758
01:16:10,700 --> 01:16:11,866
Then show us your pussy!!!

759
01:16:13,101 --> 01:16:14,335
Okay.

760
01:16:15,571 --> 01:16:17,838
Do it or die, Ian.

761
01:16:17,840 --> 01:16:20,675
What the fuck.
What the fuck.

762
01:16:22,678 --> 01:16:25,179
This is fucked up.
This is fucked!

763
01:16:31,086 --> 01:16:33,754
Goooooooooooooooooooood!!!

764
01:16:33,756 --> 01:16:35,723
Now....

765
01:16:37,259 --> 01:16:40,361
Make it hollow, Ian.

766
01:16:41,730 --> 01:16:42,897
Fuck you.

767
01:16:43,632 --> 01:16:44,966
Lol

768
01:16:54,209 --> 01:16:56,644
fuck you!
Fuck you, bitches!

769
01:16:57,112 --> 01:16:58,112
Lol

770
01:17:05,020 --> 01:17:07,088
what the fuck
are you crying about?

771
01:17:07,090 --> 01:17:08,689
Look at all that blood.

772
01:17:08,691 --> 01:17:09,991
This is getting boring.

773
01:17:09,993 --> 01:17:12,393
What happens if we turn
this shit up to ten?

774
01:17:15,197 --> 01:17:17,131
...That.

775
01:17:23,972 --> 01:17:26,273
Hi. Is Ian here?

776
01:17:26,275 --> 01:17:27,942
He flew me out
from Maine to work.

777
01:17:29,645 --> 01:17:30,911
Uh, I'm Nancy.

778
01:17:34,650 --> 01:17:37,785
Uh. Hello, Nancy. Welcome.

779
01:17:37,787 --> 01:17:42,390
Uh, you're joining us during a period
of transition for the company.

780
01:17:42,392 --> 01:17:44,759
As of today, we're actually
under new management.

781
01:17:45,894 --> 01:17:49,163
Oh. Well, what happened
to Ian?

782
01:17:49,165 --> 01:17:54,969
Unfortunately, Ian is no longer with
the company, due to, uh, cutbacks.

783
01:17:59,875 --> 01:18:01,876
Halloween wishes

784
01:18:01,878 --> 01:18:03,878
happy Halloween

uvu

787
01:18:14,123 --> 01:18:18,325
your imagination come to life!

788
01:18:19,895 --> 01:18:24,065
Uvu shows you you!

789
01:18:29,371 --> 01:18:31,005
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

790
01:18:31,007 --> 01:18:32,473
Your kids are going
to love that.

791
01:18:32,475 --> 01:18:34,208
Yes, the kids are definitely
going to love it.

792
01:18:34,210 --> 01:18:37,378
Yes, wait 'til you put it on
your head.

793
01:18:37,380 --> 01:18:39,213
Well, I'll leave that...
I'll leave that to the kids.

794
01:18:39,215 --> 01:18:41,182
All right. Hope they enjoy.

795
01:18:41,184 --> 01:18:42,083
- Yup, thank you.
- Merry Christmas.

796
01:18:42,085 --> 01:18:44,151
Merry Christmas. Goodnight.

797
01:18:44,153 --> 01:18:46,287
- Hi.
- Oh, I'm sorry, we're closed.

798
01:18:46,289 --> 01:18:47,988
Oh, no, no, no, I called.
About the uvu.

799
01:18:48,890 --> 01:18:50,491
That guy got the last one.

800
01:18:50,493 --> 01:18:52,093
What? No. I called.

801
01:18:52,095 --> 01:18:54,295
I'm Pete Gunderson.
I said I was coming.

802
01:18:54,297 --> 01:18:54,295
First come, first served.

803
01:18:54,297 --> 01:18:57,832
- But you... -Sorry, pal.
Holidays are hell.

804
01:19:02,170 --> 01:19:03,170
Fuck.

805
01:19:04,406 --> 01:19:06,273
Yeah, honey.
Got the last one.

806
01:19:06,275 --> 01:19:07,942
- Okay, I'll be home in 15.
- Excuse me.

807
01:19:07,944 --> 01:19:10,277
- I love you. Bye.
- Excuse me, sir? Hi.

808
01:19:10,279 --> 01:19:12,446
Um, look, I'll, I'll...

809
01:19:12,448 --> 01:19:14,248
I'll give you $300 for it.

810
01:19:14,250 --> 01:19:16,484
Yeah, not a chance, pal.
Try Ebay.

811
01:19:16,486 --> 01:19:16,484
Wait, wait, wait!
Please, please.

812
01:19:16,486 --> 01:19:21,922
I'll, I'll, I'll give you,
I'll give you 500.

813
01:19:21,924 --> 01:19:23,991
Please, it's Christmas Eve.
I'm out of time.

814
01:19:23,993 --> 01:19:25,459
Yeah well, listen, if it was
really that important,

815
01:19:25,461 --> 01:19:26,827
you would have
gotten here earlier.

816
01:19:26,829 --> 01:19:27,895
Merry Christmas.

817
01:19:29,431 --> 01:19:30,765
Fuck! Oh, fuck!

818
01:19:35,403 --> 01:19:37,071
Sara did you get it???

819
01:19:48,283 --> 01:19:50,050
Oh, my god.

820
01:19:50,052 --> 01:19:51,418
Oh, my god, um...

821
01:19:54,256 --> 01:19:56,157
I'll call...

822
01:19:57,226 --> 01:19:58,506
Sara
please tell me you got it???

823
01:20:18,013 --> 01:20:19,079
Sorry.

824
01:20:24,553 --> 01:20:28,155
I finally had it, and I told
ed he was full of shit.

825
01:20:28,157 --> 01:20:31,926
I mean, I deserve that Christmas
bonus a hell of a lot more

826
01:20:31,928 --> 01:20:34,962
than that do-nothing,
kiss-ass nephew of his.

827
01:20:34,964 --> 01:20:36,597
I swear I could kill him.
Scrooge.

828
01:20:37,899 --> 01:20:39,099
What?

829
01:20:40,302 --> 01:20:42,236
Have you not been
listening to me?

830
01:20:42,238 --> 01:20:45,539
Ed didn't give me the Christmas
bonus that we were counting on.

831
01:20:45,541 --> 01:20:48,042
And with you making
less money now...

832
01:20:48,044 --> 01:20:50,177
God. I'm at the end
of my rope.

833
01:20:52,113 --> 01:20:53,948
How much was this thing anyway?

834
01:20:53,950 --> 01:20:55,549
I hope you didn't overspend.

835
01:21:15,570 --> 01:21:17,037
Stop.

836
01:21:17,039 --> 01:21:18,539
- Come on.

837
01:21:19,641 --> 01:21:21,008
No.

838
01:21:35,156 --> 01:21:37,324
I still can't believe
you got it, dad!

839
01:21:39,261 --> 01:21:41,061
So, you, uh,
you just watch stuff on them?

840
01:21:41,063 --> 01:21:43,297
Yeah, it aggregates
your online identity

841
01:21:43,299 --> 01:21:44,632
to figure out what to show you.

842
01:21:49,404 --> 01:21:51,171
<i>Congratulations, captain!</i>

843
01:21:51,173 --> 01:21:53,340
<i>You're the first person
to walk on Mars.</i>

844
01:21:53,342 --> 01:21:54,975
<i>You've got to try it, dad.</i>

845
01:21:55,326 --> 01:21:57,245
Am I going to see what you saw?

846
01:21:57,246 --> 01:22:00,314
No, it's different for everyone.

847
01:22:04,219 --> 01:22:05,319
- Thank you, daddy.

848
01:22:05,321 --> 01:22:07,021
Thank you, daddy.

849
01:22:07,023 --> 01:22:08,956
It's totally cool, right?

850
01:22:09,991 --> 01:22:12,359
Right. Yeah. Totally.

851
01:22:12,994 --> 01:22:14,395
Wow.

852
01:22:15,230 --> 01:22:16,630
Um, is this the off button?

853
01:22:53,101 --> 01:22:55,602
Please don't punish me, daddy.

854
01:22:55,604 --> 01:22:58,605
I promise
I won't be naughty anymore.

855
01:23:14,322 --> 01:23:16,390
Oh, god. Oh, my god.

856
01:23:16,392 --> 01:23:18,325
Um, I'll call. I'll call.
I'll call.

857
01:23:22,364 --> 01:23:23,364
Sorry.

858
01:23:25,066 --> 01:23:26,400
What the fuck?

859
01:23:31,495 --> 01:23:32,574
Heart attack, huh?

860
01:23:32,575 --> 01:23:38,112
Yeah. Probably would have made
it too, if he got help in time.

861
01:23:38,114 --> 01:23:40,581
Hell of a Christmas gift
for his family.

862
01:23:40,583 --> 01:23:42,316
Fucking Christmas.

863
01:23:42,751 --> 01:23:44,718
I hear ya, bro.

864
01:23:44,720 --> 01:23:46,620
...Okay. Bag him up.

865
01:23:46,622 --> 01:23:48,022
We need the fridge space.

866
01:23:49,726 --> 01:23:50,625
Happy holidays!

867
01:23:50,626 --> 01:23:54,661
Hi! Um, it says on your
website that um, uh...

868
01:23:54,663 --> 01:23:58,098
Less than one percent of users
may experience an, uh,

869
01:23:58,100 --> 01:24:00,067
adverse reaction
when using the device?

870
01:24:00,069 --> 01:24:01,769
And I was just, just wondering,

871
01:24:01,771 --> 01:24:07,808
what type of adverse reactions
are users experiencing exactly?

872
01:24:07,810 --> 01:24:10,044
<i>Are you having trouble
with your device, sir?</i>

873
01:24:12,280 --> 01:24:15,315
Uh, troub... no...

874
01:24:15,317 --> 01:24:18,819
No. I'm not, no...
Just wondering.

875
01:24:18,821 --> 01:24:18,819
<i>Well, if you'd like to give me
your name and login,</i>

876
01:24:18,821 --> 01:24:24,792
<i>I can check your video feed to see if
there's anything abnormal going on.</i>

877
01:24:24,794 --> 01:24:27,161
Uh, you can do that?

878
01:24:27,163 --> 01:24:29,063
That's, no, that's fine. I don't need that.
That's not necessary.

879
01:24:29,065 --> 01:24:30,330
Thank you, very much.

880
01:24:42,677 --> 01:24:44,144
Sara?

881
01:24:44,679 --> 01:24:46,346
Where's Bobby?

882
01:24:46,348 --> 01:24:48,215
I sent him
to stay with a friend.

883
01:24:49,551 --> 01:24:51,485
You forgot to log out, Pete.

884
01:24:55,857 --> 01:25:00,127
I don't know what
that showed you, but...

885
01:25:00,129 --> 01:25:01,195
Everything.

886
01:25:02,097 --> 01:25:03,630
I saw everything.

887
01:25:05,500 --> 01:25:07,434
I just want to know one thing.

888
01:25:08,470 --> 01:25:09,470
Why'd you do it?

889
01:25:15,210 --> 01:25:17,578
Because he had what I wanted,

890
01:25:21,416 --> 01:25:24,251
and I was tired of being nice.

891
01:25:26,821 --> 01:25:28,122
Oh, Pete.

892
01:25:29,624 --> 01:25:32,226
That is the hottest thing
you have ever said.

893
01:26:14,836 --> 01:26:17,538
Hey! Everyone's gone. I'm going
to go ahead and lock up.

894
01:26:25,513 --> 01:26:28,682
And I made this,
just the way you like it.

895
01:26:33,354 --> 01:26:36,290
Oh, ed.
You don't look so good.

896
01:26:38,827 --> 01:26:40,427
I hope you aren't afraid
of the dark, ed.

897
01:26:41,830 --> 01:26:43,964
Should've given me
that bonus, ed.

898
01:26:53,908 --> 01:26:54,975
Mmm.

899
01:26:58,479 --> 01:27:00,314
This is what happens
to scrooges like you.

900
01:27:04,285 --> 01:27:05,819
Ain't the holidays hell?

901
01:27:19,901 --> 01:27:22,502
Uvu uvu shows you you!

902
01:27:22,504 --> 01:27:23,804
Pete, you awake?

903
01:27:28,576 --> 01:27:31,478
Remember he is watching

904
01:27:31,480 --> 01:27:32,879
merry Christmas

906
01:27:42,023 --> 01:27:43,457
sweet memories

907
01:27:44,893 --> 01:27:49,563
choo-choo
chose me!

908
01:27:49,565 --> 01:27:49,563
My bunny

909
01:27:49,565 --> 01:27:52,566
I didn't want to
have to do this.

910
01:27:52,568 --> 01:27:54,468
You know, I kept pushing it off.

911
01:27:56,437 --> 01:27:57,504
Trick or treat

912
01:27:57,506 --> 01:28:00,340
I didn't want
to ruin another holiday.

913
01:28:00,809 --> 01:28:04,611
I wanted to pretend like
everything was okay.

914
01:28:05,613 --> 01:28:06,680
Merry merry!

915
01:28:06,682 --> 01:28:07,981
But you...

916
01:28:07,983 --> 01:28:09,316
You.

917
01:28:12,420 --> 01:28:13,787
I mean I thought
that when you...

918
01:28:15,923 --> 01:28:17,591
When you got to know me...

919
01:28:17,593 --> 01:28:21,695
You know, when you saw
the real me, that you'd...

920
01:28:24,866 --> 01:28:26,633
Ah, never mind.

921
01:28:28,369 --> 01:28:30,737
Tonight at midnight,

922
01:28:30,739 --> 01:28:34,041
I want to kiss someone
who makes me feel

923
01:28:34,043 --> 01:28:35,809
like I can take
the tape off their lips.

924
01:28:43,618 --> 01:28:44,851
God damn it.

925
01:29:00,102 --> 01:29:02,703
Sorry about that.
Let me try that again.

926
01:29:07,742 --> 01:29:09,343
Jesus Christ.

927
01:29:18,686 --> 01:29:20,487
Mandy. Mandy.

928
01:29:20,922 --> 01:29:21,922
Hey.

929
01:29:51,419 --> 01:29:53,920
Reggief

930
01:29:57,592 --> 01:29:59,092
can't be worse
than the last one.

931
01:30:08,870 --> 01:30:10,837
How is it?

932
01:30:10,839 --> 01:30:12,739
They're great. They're the
best chicken fingers.

933
01:30:12,741 --> 01:30:15,108
They, they bread them
with frosted flakes.

934
01:30:16,878 --> 01:30:19,546
My mom didn't let me
eat sugary cereal.

935
01:30:19,548 --> 01:30:21,882
You know, rots your teeth.

936
01:30:21,884 --> 01:30:22,884
My teeth aren't rotten.

937
01:30:24,152 --> 01:30:26,019
You, you must brush a lot.

938
01:30:26,021 --> 01:30:29,423
- Do you brush a lot?
- I don't know. I guess so.

939
01:30:30,625 --> 01:30:31,725
Let me see 'em.

940
01:30:32,059 --> 01:30:33,794
What?

941
01:30:33,796 --> 01:30:35,429
Let me see those pearly whites.

942
01:30:35,930 --> 01:30:37,964
I bet they sparkle.

943
01:30:37,966 --> 01:30:40,600
- Let me see
those choppers, come on.

944
01:30:41,736 --> 01:30:43,603
Yeah. I knew it.

945
01:30:45,206 --> 01:30:46,840
You have great teeth.

946
01:30:52,914 --> 01:30:54,581
That was... that was...

947
01:30:54,583 --> 01:30:56,149
I'm sorry.

948
01:30:56,151 --> 01:30:57,551
I'm sorry.

949
01:30:57,553 --> 01:30:59,619
That was, um,
it's just the nerves.

950
01:31:00,922 --> 01:31:02,622
That's the problem with these
first dates, you know.

951
01:31:02,624 --> 01:31:04,624
If people got to know
the real me,

952
01:31:04,626 --> 01:31:05,859
you know, they would love me.

953
01:31:05,861 --> 01:31:07,828
But, you know, they
never get to meet me.

954
01:31:07,830 --> 01:31:10,063
You know, because it's just...

955
01:31:10,065 --> 01:31:12,899
Because the, the nerve monster
just rears its ugly head.

956
01:31:15,903 --> 01:31:17,663
Most guys I date online
just want to hook up.

957
01:31:18,039 --> 01:31:19,105
One and done.

958
01:31:20,708 --> 01:31:22,809
They act like I'm crazy for
wanting something more lasting.

959
01:31:22,912 --> 01:31:23,811
Right?

960
01:31:23,812 --> 01:31:28,482
You know people say that those
dating websites are bullshit

961
01:31:28,484 --> 01:31:31,218
but I mean, 96 percent?

962
01:31:31,220 --> 01:31:34,754
I mean, like, that's an
all-time high for me.

963
01:31:34,756 --> 01:31:37,023
I mean my last girlfriend was
like an 84 percent and, you know,

964
01:31:37,025 --> 01:31:39,826
yeah, no surprise that didn't,
that didn't turn out.

965
01:31:40,728 --> 01:31:42,796
Mmm. What happened?

966
01:31:42,798 --> 01:31:44,664
She, um... I had to...

967
01:31:46,634 --> 01:31:47,767
I had to end it.

968
01:31:49,637 --> 01:31:50,904
Tsk. It was for the best.

969
01:31:52,173 --> 01:31:53,507
Mmm.

970
01:31:56,210 --> 01:31:57,711
Sorry.

971
01:31:57,713 --> 01:32:00,514
You are so much hotter
than she was.

972
01:32:03,150 --> 01:32:05,151
I mean, uh... uh...

973
01:32:05,153 --> 01:32:07,053
Prettier.

974
01:32:07,055 --> 01:32:08,622
Should we get the check?

975
01:32:31,212 --> 01:32:33,079
I'm sorry.

976
01:32:33,081 --> 01:32:35,248
- For what?
- For calling you hot.

977
01:32:36,584 --> 01:32:37,884
Why would you
apologize for that?

978
01:32:37,886 --> 01:32:39,886
Because it made me
sound all pervy.

979
01:32:39,888 --> 01:32:42,589
Like I was trying
to hook up with you.

980
01:32:42,591 --> 01:32:44,291
You know.

981
01:32:44,293 --> 01:32:46,133
And I know you don't
like that on a first date.

982
01:32:50,097 --> 01:32:51,765
It's new year's Eve.

983
01:32:51,767 --> 01:32:53,600
I'd have to be the most
unromantic gal in the world

984
01:32:53,602 --> 01:32:56,002
to want to go home
to a lonely apartment.

985
01:32:59,206 --> 01:33:00,574
Yup.

986
01:33:04,579 --> 01:33:06,899
Do you want to go back to my
place and watch the ball drop?

987
01:33:23,631 --> 01:33:25,365
- Can I take your jacket?
- Yeah.

988
01:33:37,078 --> 01:33:39,112
Uh, whoa. Whoa!

989
01:33:39,114 --> 01:33:40,814
Should I not?

990
01:33:40,816 --> 01:33:42,882
Uh, no. It's just. Uh...
I need to use the restroom.

991
01:33:42,884 --> 01:33:44,918
You know, I just...
I want to freshen up.

992
01:33:44,920 --> 01:33:48,154
Okay. Great idea.
Down the hall to the right.

993
01:35:00,895 --> 01:35:02,028

994
