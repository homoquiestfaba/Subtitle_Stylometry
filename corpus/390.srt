1
00:05:35,827 --> 00:05:37,367
After the matter is over,

2
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:40,570
the images would not disappear completely

3
00:05:40,570 --> 00:05:42,442
due to the influence of

4
00:05:42,442 --> 00:05:44,272
reversible nerve connection.

5
00:05:44,272 --> 00:05:47,393
He will be afraid of looking at himself

6
00:05:47,393 --> 00:05:49,389
because of the consistent mood memory.

7
00:05:49,389 --> 00:05:51,095
The centre of fear will cause him to develop

8
00:05:51,095 --> 00:05:53,383
emotions such as preference and fear.

9
00:05:53,383 --> 00:05:54,382
When he is in fear,

10
00:05:54,382 --> 00:05:56,296
he will enter the state of false death.

11
00:05:56,296 --> 00:05:57,710
- stop breathing.

12
00:05:57,710 --> 00:06:00,290
And his heart might even stop beating

13
00:06:00,290 --> 00:06:03,410
from functional effects.

14
00:06:03,410 --> 00:06:06,031
Because of reversible nerve connection,

15
00:06:06,031 --> 00:06:08,527
illusions will stay

16
00:06:08,527 --> 00:06:11,855
and he will choose to avoid remembering.

17
00:08:10,630 --> 00:08:12,044
How are you, upper classmates?

18
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:14,957
Chen Ling.

19
00:08:14,957 --> 00:08:16,329
I'm the new captain of the basketball team.

20
00:08:16,329 --> 00:08:18,410
I saw you and you're pretty good at playing.

21
00:08:18,410 --> 00:08:20,407
Are you interested in joining the team?

22
00:08:20,407 --> 00:08:21,655
If you were to join,

23
00:08:21,655 --> 00:08:23,360
we'd surely win the college cup.

24
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:24,650
Isn't that quite a waste of time?

25
00:08:28,395 --> 00:08:30,474
Do we get paid if we win the championship?

26
00:08:30,599 --> 00:08:31,597
Of course not.

27
00:08:32,305 --> 00:08:33,303
Then forget it.

28
00:08:35,509 --> 00:08:38,129
Didn't I tell you he was strange?

29
00:08:38,129 --> 00:08:39,585
Is he a little conceited?

30
00:09:04,547 --> 00:09:06,377
Qi Luo.

31
00:09:07,667 --> 00:09:09,664
Han Qi Luo.

32
00:09:12,202 --> 00:09:13,991
Sorry.

33
00:09:20,813 --> 00:09:23,226
Little sweet teacher.

34
00:09:23,601 --> 00:09:24,724
Hello.

35
00:09:27,137 --> 00:09:28,011
Qi Luo.

36
00:09:28,011 --> 00:09:29,841
How did you get to know such a bad kid?

37
00:09:29,841 --> 00:09:31,422
Listen to your teacher. Stay away from him.

38
00:09:51,391 --> 00:09:52,972
In the back.

39
00:09:53,471 --> 00:09:54,553
Come over.

40
00:09:55,385 --> 00:09:56,384
Hurry up.

41
00:10:11,652 --> 00:10:12,650
So much stuff.

42
00:10:14,023 --> 00:10:15,230
Sorry..

43
00:10:16,436 --> 00:10:18,474
I interrupted you during your class.

44
00:10:18,766 --> 00:10:19,431
Oh, yeah.

45
00:10:28,667 --> 00:10:30,289
Return this to you.

46
00:10:30,581 --> 00:10:33,077
It was a little crumpled..

47
00:10:33,077 --> 00:10:34,990
but I've made a copy.

48
00:10:35,115 --> 00:10:35,989
Thank you.

49
00:10:37,903 --> 00:10:39,193
You're thanking me?

50
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:40,607
I messed up your drawing.

51
00:10:40,607 --> 00:10:41,605
Why thank me?

52
00:10:42,230 --> 00:10:43,228
Sorry.. because..

53
00:10:43,228 --> 00:10:44,934
I didn't know there was a drawing at the back,

54
00:10:44,934 --> 00:10:45,932
so I stuffed it

55
00:10:45,932 --> 00:10:47,638
in my pant pocket carelessly.

56
00:10:48,137 --> 00:10:49,344
It's okay.

57
00:10:49,344 --> 00:10:50,716
Anyway, it's only a draft.

58
00:10:50,716 --> 00:10:52,922
It's no use once I paint it on canvas.

59
00:10:56,540 --> 00:10:58,163
Useless meaning...

60
00:10:59,453 --> 00:11:01,241
you want to throw it away?

61
00:11:03,363 --> 00:11:04,986
If you're going to throw it away..

62
00:11:05,028 --> 00:11:06,567
Can you give it to me?

63
00:11:08,689 --> 00:11:10,269
If you really like it..

64
00:11:10,269 --> 00:11:12,600
I can give you the final oil painting.

65
00:11:12,974 --> 00:11:14,097
Really?

66
00:11:14,596 --> 00:11:15,802
You're not kidding me, right?

67
00:11:18,590 --> 00:11:19,921
I'll paint as fast as I can.

68
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:27,909
Don't I act somewhat imprudent?

69
00:11:29,739 --> 00:11:32,153
I'm taking your stuff for no reason.

70
00:11:33,234 --> 00:11:34,150
Now that I think it over..

71
00:11:34,150 --> 00:11:36,937
It really feels that way.

72
00:11:39,349 --> 00:11:40,972
I don't have money.

73
00:11:42,553 --> 00:11:44,882
What is there that I can use for exchange?

74
00:11:51,373 --> 00:11:52,912
Why don't I protect you?

75
00:11:53,203 --> 00:11:54,493
Let's agree on it first.

76
00:11:54,909 --> 00:11:56,823
Whatever happens to you in the future..

77
00:11:56,823 --> 00:11:58,903
I will certainly be by your side and help you.

78
00:11:59,901 --> 00:12:01,066
Let's just agree on it. Okay?

79
00:12:01,607 --> 00:12:05,018
Anyway, this is just what I'm capable of doing.

80
00:12:05,518 --> 00:12:06,641
Bye bye.

81
00:12:10,219 --> 00:12:11,342
Also..

82
00:12:13,339 --> 00:12:15,669
There's one more thing I can help you with.

83
00:12:16,501 --> 00:12:17,666
It's...

84
00:12:18,872 --> 00:12:20,952
When you want to fool around..

85
00:12:23,989 --> 00:12:26,194
I can contribute my body for you to use.

86
00:12:26,693 --> 00:12:28,066
Free of charge.

87
00:12:30,271 --> 00:12:31,394
Bye bye.

88
00:12:37,011 --> 00:12:38,009
Can you..

89
00:12:38,716 --> 00:12:40,422
Can you lend me your body?

90
00:12:53,235 --> 00:12:54,442
What did you just say?

91
00:12:55,857 --> 00:12:57,770
I.. I just said..

92
00:12:57,770 --> 00:12:59,850
Can you lend me your body

93
00:12:59,850 --> 00:13:01,265
to be my model?

94
00:13:23,730 --> 00:13:25,145
You can come in now.

95
00:13:33,756 --> 00:13:35,670
So sneaky like this..

96
00:13:36,544 --> 00:13:37,875
I'm not used to it.

97
00:13:45,072 --> 00:13:46,570
Over there is fine.

98
00:13:49,399 --> 00:13:50,979
Do I need to take off my clothes?

99
00:13:50,979 --> 00:13:52,103
No.

100
00:13:52,103 --> 00:13:53,683
You only need to take off the jacket.

101
00:14:05,624 --> 00:14:07,038
You can just sit here.

102
00:14:08,328 --> 00:14:09,451
How do I sit?

103
00:14:09,451 --> 00:14:11,240
However you like.

104
00:14:22,764 --> 00:14:25,676
When I said I would lend you my body,

105
00:14:26,966 --> 00:14:28,671
I never thought you would waste a heavenly thing

106
00:14:28,671 --> 00:14:29,794
and use it for painting.

107
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,997
My original intention was..

108
00:14:33,997 --> 00:14:36,826
that the two of us went to do something happy

109
00:14:36,826 --> 00:14:39,530
and would make you feel very comfortable.

110
00:14:42,026 --> 00:14:42,816
Hey.

111
00:14:44,938 --> 00:14:46,727
I heard you hate men.

112
00:14:46,727 --> 00:14:48,017
Is it true?

113
00:14:48,516 --> 00:14:50,055
Why do you hate them?

114
00:14:51,927 --> 00:14:54,049
It's not because you like girls right?

115
00:14:56,337 --> 00:14:58,874
Could you please not twist around?

116
00:14:58,874 --> 00:15:00,664
And stop talking.

117
00:15:00,664 --> 00:15:02,785
It's hard for me to draw with you acting like this.

118
00:15:02,785 --> 00:15:05,156
I'm not a statue like these,

119
00:15:05,156 --> 00:15:07,487
I'm a real person.

120
00:15:13,893 --> 00:15:15,391
Have you heard of the Mars prophecy?

121
00:15:17,762 --> 00:15:18,927
Talk.

122
00:15:20,633 --> 00:15:24,627
It says that a terrifying King will control this world

123
00:15:24,627 --> 00:15:27,539
and the world will be ruled by Mars.

124
00:15:31,741 --> 00:15:34,237
What kind of world do you think it would be

125
00:15:34,237 --> 00:15:36,275
if it was ruled by Mars?

126
00:15:37,773 --> 00:15:39,146
It seems that you're more inclined

127
00:15:39,146 --> 00:15:40,560
to believe that Mars is evil.

128
00:15:41,185 --> 00:15:42,557
It doesn't matter what I believe in.

129
00:15:43,264 --> 00:15:45,761
The world is all messed up anyway.

130
00:15:45,761 --> 00:15:47,300
It'll collapse sooner or later.

131
00:15:48,090 --> 00:15:49,297
I also don't believe the future

132
00:15:49,297 --> 00:15:50,296
is going to be that great.

133
00:15:51,087 --> 00:15:52,210
So why not..

134
00:15:52,210 --> 00:15:55,412
just come to a flashy and glorified end?

135
00:15:55,412 --> 00:15:56,827
Doesn't that sound better?

136
00:16:06,437 --> 00:16:07,852
Why hasn't it happened yet?

137
00:16:11,554 --> 00:16:12,344
This world..

138
00:16:12,344 --> 00:16:14,134
I wonder how it's going to end.

139
00:16:21,081 --> 00:16:23,078
If the world is really destroyed..

140
00:16:23,078 --> 00:16:24,492
Wouldn't you be devastated?

141
00:16:33,603 --> 00:16:35,310
What happened to your hand?

142
00:16:47,541 --> 00:16:49,954
He's already fallen asleep, just like that.

143
00:17:09,507 --> 00:17:12,211
He acts crazily.

144
00:17:12,211 --> 00:17:16,621
And it's difficult for people to identify him.

145
00:17:16,995 --> 00:17:20,406
But he has such a clean face,

146
00:17:20,406 --> 00:17:22,112
such a pure face.

147
00:17:22,736 --> 00:17:25,149
I can't sense any trace of malice in it.

148
00:17:26,023 --> 00:17:27,728
In this world..

149
00:17:27,728 --> 00:17:29,185
there are many malicious people

150
00:17:29,227 --> 00:17:31,639
and you can't do anything about them.

151
00:17:31,639 --> 00:17:34,468
It doesn't matter how hard they try to pretend.

152
00:17:34,468 --> 00:17:37,380
Their malice will be revealed bit by bit

153
00:17:37,380 --> 00:17:39,668
and emit a foul smell.

154
00:17:42,289 --> 00:17:46,699
'Appear' is 'vi', an intransitive verb.

155
00:17:46,699 --> 00:17:47,906
It's very easy, right?

156
00:17:47,906 --> 00:17:49,612
Anyone want to volunteer and come up here

157
00:17:49,612 --> 00:17:50,901
to construct a sentence?

158
00:17:58,098 --> 00:17:59,513
Chen Ling.

159
00:18:01,427 --> 00:18:02,383
Chen Ling.

160
00:18:09,123 --> 00:18:10,953
The teacher wants you to go up front.

161
00:18:11,952 --> 00:18:13,033
What for?

162
00:18:13,866 --> 00:18:15,156
To construct a sentence.

163
00:18:17,860 --> 00:18:19,648
Teacher, let me do it.

164
00:18:20,064 --> 00:18:21,354
Don't be so quick.

165
00:18:21,354 --> 00:18:23,060
Let's give Chen Ling a chance.

166
00:18:23,767 --> 00:18:24,932
What's the matter, Chen Ling?

167
00:18:24,932 --> 00:18:26,471
You've taken this course for two years.

168
00:18:26,471 --> 00:18:27,594
This shouldn't be difficult for you.

169
00:18:52,264 --> 00:18:55,135
Is that right that you can piss people off

170
00:18:55,135 --> 00:18:57,256
during the 10-minute recess?

171
00:19:01,667 --> 00:19:02,873
You woke me up.

172
00:19:03,830 --> 00:19:04,954
Don't blame me.

173
00:19:52,214 --> 00:19:54,128
This teacher, who appears to be nice,

174
00:19:54,128 --> 00:19:55,750
is in reality a terrible person

175
00:19:55,791 --> 00:19:57,455
who initiates sexual harrassment

176
00:19:57,455 --> 00:19:58,413
to his female students.

177
00:20:00,326 --> 00:20:01,533
Quiet!

178
00:20:01,533 --> 00:20:02,531
Quiet! Stop making noises!

179
00:20:03,239 --> 00:20:04,237
Teacher.

180
00:20:04,528 --> 00:20:06,317
I stayed in Los Angeles for eight years

181
00:20:06,317 --> 00:20:07,648
when I was eight years old.

182
00:20:22,085 --> 00:20:23,374
Hurry up.

183
00:20:23,374 --> 00:20:25,703
Isn't it fun to strike back?

184
00:20:54,950 --> 00:20:56,490
Tong Dao.

185
00:20:56,947 --> 00:20:58,861
Tong Dao. It's time to come back.

186
00:21:24,031 --> 00:21:25,653
What were you doing over there?

187
00:21:29,148 --> 00:21:30,229
I was watching the world's

188
00:21:30,229 --> 00:21:31,768
most beautiful thing.

189
00:22:13,745 --> 00:22:16,242
You tore apart your clothes again?

190
00:22:39,331 --> 00:22:40,621
Tong Dao.

191
00:22:41,079 --> 00:22:42,367
What happened?

192
00:22:42,409 --> 00:22:44,115
You're not wearing your uniform again.

193
00:22:46,736 --> 00:22:49,440
Because this makes me look more normal.

194
00:22:53,392 --> 00:22:54,849
Dr. Zhao said

195
00:22:54,849 --> 00:22:57,261
you'd be released from the hospital next week.

196
00:22:57,261 --> 00:22:58,260
You've been here

197
00:22:58,260 --> 00:23:00,673
probably for almost two years.

198
00:23:00,673 --> 00:23:02,462
Two months short.

199
00:23:03,793 --> 00:23:05,498
President, you remember my name.

200
00:23:07,288 --> 00:23:08,286
People here,

201
00:23:08,286 --> 00:23:10,408
are coming and going,

202
00:23:10,408 --> 00:23:12,114
but I remember every kid,

203
00:23:12,114 --> 00:23:15,192
and their individual stories.

204
00:23:16,523 --> 00:23:17,605
What a coincidence.

205
00:23:17,605 --> 00:23:18,936
I've been looking for a person

206
00:23:18,936 --> 00:23:20,310
to answer my question.

207
00:23:22,223 --> 00:23:25,052
I once found a drawing left by a previous patient.

208
00:23:32,332 --> 00:23:34,038
Do you know who drew it?

209
00:23:36,784 --> 00:23:38,781
Of course, I remember.

210
00:23:38,781 --> 00:23:41,318
He was my patient.

211
00:23:42,276 --> 00:23:44,480
He's about your age.

212
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:47,393
When he just checked into the hospital,

213
00:23:47,393 --> 00:23:50,013
he dared not to look at mirrors.

214
00:23:50,013 --> 00:23:53,133
He broke all the mirrors in the hospital.

215
00:24:01,121 --> 00:24:03,451
I wonder how he's doing now.

216
00:24:16,971 --> 00:24:17,970
Chen Ling.

217
00:24:18,761 --> 00:24:19,967
You're leaving?

218
00:24:20,383 --> 00:24:21,881
Yeah. I'm on my way to work.

219
00:24:22,588 --> 00:24:23,462
Then..

220
00:24:23,462 --> 00:24:24,876
I'll go to your place tonight, okay?

221
00:24:28,079 --> 00:24:31,200
Aren't we already over?

222
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:35,319
Bye bye.

223
00:24:45,553 --> 00:24:46,760
Okay.

224
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:49,464
I'll call you if I get home early.

225
00:24:51,169 --> 00:24:52,251
Bye bye.

226
00:24:56,660 --> 00:24:58,657
Qing Mei.

227
00:24:58,657 --> 00:24:59,573
What are you doing?

228
00:25:01,112 --> 00:25:02,693
You still haven't given up?

229
00:25:03,899 --> 00:25:06,271
Some things will never end.

230
00:26:32,832 --> 00:26:34,534
Fortunately, you reacted quickly.

231
00:26:34,535 --> 00:26:35,967
Otherwise, you'd either be dead

232
00:26:35,968 --> 00:26:37,459
or half dead at your normal speed.

233
00:26:37,460 --> 00:26:39,253
Both your brake lines have been cut off.

234
00:26:39,353 --> 00:26:41,244
Does someone have a grudge against you?

235
00:26:41,808 --> 00:26:43,082
Too many to count.

236
00:26:43,530 --> 00:26:45,420
You better be careful.

237
00:26:45,421 --> 00:26:46,416
Do you still race?

238
00:26:47,092 --> 00:26:49,500
Bike out of service. No money.

239
00:26:49,501 --> 00:26:50,694
How can I race?

240
00:26:54,098 --> 00:26:56,068
Did you fight with your dad again?

241
00:26:56,566 --> 00:26:57,362
Yeah.

242
00:26:58,257 --> 00:27:01,243
I just don't get along with him.

243
00:27:01,343 --> 00:27:02,736
And he keeps bugging me to quit

244
00:27:02,737 --> 00:27:04,129
riding motorcycles all the time.

245
00:27:04,925 --> 00:27:06,019
He's just worried about you.

246
00:27:06,020 --> 00:27:07,512
Why don't you move back home?

247
00:27:08,527 --> 00:27:09,502
Go home?

248
00:27:10,895 --> 00:27:13,284
If I go home, I think I'd go crazy.

249
00:27:13,801 --> 00:27:15,771
But you're already crazy anyway.

250
00:27:18,657 --> 00:27:20,050
True.

251
00:27:27,912 --> 00:27:28,609
Good morning, Teacher Fang.

252
00:27:28,609 --> 00:27:29,605
Good morning.

253
00:27:29,606 --> 00:27:30,601
Good morning, Teacher.

254
00:27:30,602 --> 00:27:31,597
Good morning.

255
00:27:31,598 --> 00:27:32,792
Good morning, Teacher Fang.

256
00:27:34,505 --> 00:27:35,420
Good morning.

257
00:27:37,266 --> 00:27:38,410
Good morning, Teacher.

258
00:27:40,331 --> 00:27:41,346
It seems that you have more than

259
00:27:41,347 --> 00:27:42,540
one side that people don't know about.

260
00:27:42,641 --> 00:27:43,636
What are you talking about?

261
00:27:43,637 --> 00:27:44,829
Stop pretending.

262
00:27:44,830 --> 00:27:46,620
I almost ended up lying on a hospital bed.

263
00:27:52,044 --> 00:27:53,287
Fortunately,

264
00:27:53,288 --> 00:27:55,890
I like thrilling and dangerous things.

265
00:27:57,268 --> 00:27:59,457
But..

266
00:27:59,458 --> 00:28:00,651
Dear Teacher Fang.

267
00:28:01,995 --> 00:28:03,736
If we're going to play..

268
00:28:03,737 --> 00:28:05,776
Why not go all out?

269
00:28:06,622 --> 00:28:08,065
If it were me,

270
00:28:10,155 --> 00:28:12,046
I wouldn't leave something unfinished.

271
00:28:24,435 --> 00:28:25,529
Oh, yeah.

272
00:28:28,216 --> 00:28:30,047
If I remember correctly...

273
00:28:30,048 --> 00:28:32,694
Teacher, you're driving a white Civic, right?

274
00:28:35,779 --> 00:28:37,172
Be careful driving.

275
00:28:59,363 --> 00:29:00,657
Classmates. Classmates..

276
00:29:00,658 --> 00:29:01,852
I've just heard some news

277
00:29:01,853 --> 00:29:03,147
from the administration office

278
00:29:03,148 --> 00:29:04,439
that English Teacher Fang

279
00:29:04,539 --> 00:29:05,832
has just abruptly quitted.

280
00:29:05,833 --> 00:29:10,658
Oh.. Why? ...

281
00:29:33,098 --> 00:29:34,491
Chen Ling.

282
00:29:34,492 --> 00:29:36,034
Are you listening to what I'm saying?

283
00:29:36,035 --> 00:29:38,074
Yeah. Yeah. I'm listening.

284
00:29:38,372 --> 00:29:40,362
I heard you broke up with Vivian, the junior.

285
00:29:40,363 --> 00:29:41,706
Is that right?

286
00:29:41,707 --> 00:29:42,582
Why did we break up?

287
00:29:42,583 --> 00:29:45,040
Stop it. I mean it.

288
00:29:45,041 --> 00:29:46,433
I mean what I say, too.

289
00:29:46,632 --> 00:29:48,025
If you don't want to say, then forget it.

290
00:29:48,026 --> 00:29:49,916
Hey, take me for a ride on your bike sometime.

291
00:29:49,917 --> 00:29:50,613
Uh.. No.

292
00:29:51,030 --> 00:29:54,095
My bike gets jealous when I let girls ride on it.

293
00:29:54,096 --> 00:29:56,782
And then it knocks me off to the ground.

294
00:30:07,231 --> 00:30:08,624
Oh, sorry.

295
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:10,813
What are you doing?

296
00:30:15,291 --> 00:30:16,684
You're bleeding.

297
00:30:19,371 --> 00:30:20,665
How clumsy.

298
00:30:33,004 --> 00:30:33,900
By what you were doing,

299
00:30:33,901 --> 00:30:35,594
you've put her in a very dangerous position.

300
00:30:35,595 --> 00:30:36,487
Do you know that?

301
00:30:36,796 --> 00:30:38,079
Dangerous?

302
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:39,945
Oh, you're referring to that?

303
00:30:39,946 --> 00:30:42,159
That's a habit I have since my childhood.

304
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:43,612
What a strange habit.

305
00:30:43,613 --> 00:30:45,344
It's not as if you're ugly and nobody wants you.

306
00:30:45,345 --> 00:30:47,136
So why do you like a simple and conservative girl

307
00:30:47,137 --> 00:30:48,717
who doesn't know how to take care of herself?

308
00:30:48,718 --> 00:30:49,921
Let me tell you.

309
00:30:49,922 --> 00:30:51,614
If anything happens to Qi Luo because of you,

310
00:30:51,615 --> 00:30:52,558
I won't get involved.

311
00:30:53,962 --> 00:30:56,887
Why are you so concerned about her?

312
00:30:56,888 --> 00:30:59,076
You like Qi Luo. Don't you?

313
00:30:59,977 --> 00:31:01,041
What are you talking about?

314
00:31:01,042 --> 00:31:02,037
Do I like her?

315
00:31:02,038 --> 00:31:03,051
Yes, you do.

316
00:31:03,052 --> 00:31:05,261
I've suspected it for a long time.

317
00:31:05,698 --> 00:31:06,942
One moment you said she was weird.

318
00:31:06,943 --> 00:31:08,236
Next, you told me to stay away from her.

319
00:31:08,237 --> 00:31:08,833
What about now?

320
00:31:08,834 --> 00:31:10,385
Are you interested in Qi Luo?

321
00:31:10,386 --> 00:31:11,988
Do you like Qi Luo or not?

322
00:31:15,998 --> 00:31:17,690
Whether I like her or not, it doesn't matter.

323
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:21,471
Since high school..

324
00:31:21,472 --> 00:31:23,760
I've been a nobody.

325
00:31:39,781 --> 00:31:42,617
You've got quite an attitude lately, Classmate.

326
00:31:43,344 --> 00:31:45,405
Don't think you're so high and mighty just because

327
00:31:45,406 --> 00:31:47,474
somebody's been a little nicer to you lately.

328
00:31:48,837 --> 00:31:50,728
Do you think Ling would be

329
00:31:50,729 --> 00:31:52,618
serious with a girl like you?

330
00:31:54,609 --> 00:31:55,504
Hey.

331
00:31:55,848 --> 00:31:57,096
What kind of expression is that?

332
00:31:57,097 --> 00:31:58,271
What is that?

333
00:32:00,181 --> 00:32:02,172
Do you think that we're bullying you?

334
00:32:02,173 --> 00:32:03,168
Say something.

335
00:32:09,933 --> 00:32:11,028
I just don't like the way

336
00:32:11,029 --> 00:32:12,222
you look pitiful and miserable.

337
00:32:13,615 --> 00:32:16,402
Everyday, you hide in a corner acting pitiful.

338
00:32:16,601 --> 00:32:17,695
You also react slowly.

339
00:32:18,989 --> 00:32:20,482
I feel sick whenever I see you.

340
00:32:22,223 --> 00:32:23,965
You like to act pitiful, don't you?

341
00:32:25,159 --> 00:32:26,154
Fine.

342
00:32:26,751 --> 00:32:28,174
Today, I'll grant your wish.

343
00:32:31,353 --> 00:32:33,617
But I hope you'll always remember...

344
00:32:33,618 --> 00:32:35,210
Never go near Chen Ling again.

345
00:33:01,132 --> 00:33:02,177
Classmates. Class begins.

346
00:33:09,641 --> 00:33:10,735
Han Qi Luo didn't come?

347
00:33:11,034 --> 00:33:12,825
She usually doesn't skip class.

348
00:33:15,611 --> 00:33:17,005
Teacher,

349
00:33:17,006 --> 00:33:18,298
She won't be coming today.

350
00:33:18,796 --> 00:33:20,189
She won't be coming?

351
00:33:25,861 --> 00:33:26,695
That's strange.

352
00:33:26,696 --> 00:33:28,847
Even Da Ye and Chen Ling aren't here.

353
00:33:31,732 --> 00:33:33,126
Fine. Let's get ready to start class.

354
00:33:33,127 --> 00:33:34,520
Please take out your textbooks,

355
00:33:34,521 --> 00:33:35,862
and turn to page 145.

356
00:35:41,496 --> 00:35:42,690
What happened?

357
00:35:46,671 --> 00:35:47,865
How did this happen?

358
00:35:53,039 --> 00:35:54,433
Was it because of me?

359
00:35:55,527 --> 00:35:57,020
Who did this?

360
00:36:04,981 --> 00:36:06,474
It's none of your business.

361
00:36:07,668 --> 00:36:09,857
It's all because I'm too timid...

362
00:36:09,858 --> 00:36:12,046
So people don't like me.

363
00:36:19,012 --> 00:36:20,206
Where do you live?

364
00:36:21,201 --> 00:36:22,097
I'll take you home.

365
00:36:30,257 --> 00:36:31,650
Let's go.

366
00:36:32,347 --> 00:36:33,641
You're still thinking about staying here,

367
00:36:33,642 --> 00:36:34,636
and continuing school?

368
00:36:52,946 --> 00:36:54,737
Don't tell me you want to go back to class.

369
00:36:56,528 --> 00:36:59,613
Didn't you say you didn't let people ride your bike?

370
00:37:03,892 --> 00:37:05,385
I've changed my mind.

371
00:37:12,749 --> 00:37:13,545
That's right.

372
00:37:15,336 --> 00:37:17,127
If you get on the bike,

373
00:37:17,128 --> 00:37:18,620
you'll have to be very close to me.

374
00:37:18,621 --> 00:37:20,212
You also have to hold me really tight,

375
00:37:20,909 --> 00:37:22,600
but yet you don't like men.

376
00:37:28,472 --> 00:37:29,566
Forget it...

377
00:37:31,357 --> 00:37:33,746
if you're that reluctant.

378
00:38:05,092 --> 00:38:06,485
Make sure the helmet's fastened.

379
00:38:09,869 --> 00:38:10,665
Where's yours?

380
00:38:13,351 --> 00:38:15,541
The bike only has one helmet.

381
00:38:15,542 --> 00:38:17,431
You'd better pray for me not to be caught.

382
00:38:20,108 --> 00:38:21,173
Are you ready?

383
00:38:21,959 --> 00:38:23,104
Hold me tight.

384
00:38:30,766 --> 00:38:32,657
Qing Mei.

385
00:38:32,658 --> 00:38:33,951
There's motorcycle noise.

386
00:38:42,842 --> 00:38:44,200
Lai Qing Mei, what are you doing?

387
00:38:44,201 --> 00:38:45,394
We're in class.

388
00:40:20,329 --> 00:40:21,224
Thank you.

389
00:40:24,508 --> 00:40:25,503
Were you scared?

390
00:40:26,897 --> 00:40:29,857
Since I got on your bike, I could only trust you.

391
00:40:29,858 --> 00:40:31,240
Fear wouldn't help.

392
00:40:32,668 --> 00:40:35,654
Thank you for willing to trust yourself with me.

393
00:40:36,748 --> 00:40:39,535
You like to do insincere, momentary, sweet talk.

394
00:40:45,505 --> 00:40:47,744
Thank you for helping me so much.

395
00:40:47,745 --> 00:40:50,282
You've just rescued me.

396
00:40:50,283 --> 00:40:53,417
Last time, you said you'd protect me.

397
00:40:53,418 --> 00:40:56,850
I know you didn't mean it..

398
00:40:56,851 --> 00:40:58,840
but I'm still very happy about it.

399
00:41:00,631 --> 00:41:03,119
They're very important to me..

400
00:41:04,721 --> 00:41:07,199
because I haven't been this close to anyone

401
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:10,284
for a very long time.

402
00:41:11,777 --> 00:41:13,070
Thank you.

403
00:41:14,065 --> 00:41:14,861
Qi Luo.

404
00:41:16,991 --> 00:41:17,220
Qi Luo.

405
00:41:17,221 --> 00:41:19,212
What are you doing to my daughter?

406
00:41:19,213 --> 00:41:20,208
Mom, you got it all wrong.

407
00:41:20,209 --> 00:41:21,628
He wasn't going to hurt me.

408
00:41:21,629 --> 00:41:23,320
Something happened at school.

409
00:41:23,321 --> 00:41:25,390
He rescued me and brought me home with his bike.

410
00:41:28,097 --> 00:41:29,261
This is my mother.

411
00:41:31,629 --> 00:41:32,998
I'm sorry.

412
00:41:32,999 --> 00:41:36,003
I saw Qi Luo looking rather depressed, so...

413
00:41:36,456 --> 00:41:38,645
Aunt, don't mention it.

414
00:41:38,943 --> 00:41:39,789
Oh, yeah.

415
00:41:39,790 --> 00:41:41,033
I haven't introduced myself.

416
00:41:41,034 --> 00:41:42,029
I'm Chen Ling.

417
00:41:42,030 --> 00:41:43,670
I'm Qi Luo's classmate.

418
00:41:45,014 --> 00:41:46,924
Nice to meet you. I'm at your service.

419
00:41:52,477 --> 00:41:54,368
Wow..

420
00:41:55,363 --> 00:41:57,751
So this is what a mother's hand is.

421
00:41:58,746 --> 00:42:00,239
It's so warm.

422
00:42:01,065 --> 00:42:01,781
Qi Luo.

423
00:42:01,782 --> 00:42:03,224
Shouldn't we go up?

424
00:42:07,986 --> 00:42:08,498
Qi Luo.

425
00:42:08,499 --> 00:42:09,495
Let's go.

426
00:42:09,496 --> 00:42:10,491
Yes.

427
00:42:17,455 --> 00:42:18,450
It's nothing.

428
00:42:18,549 --> 00:42:19,843
I want to ask you..

429
00:42:20,043 --> 00:42:22,132
what you think of Da Ye.

430
00:42:24,122 --> 00:42:26,122
What I mean is..

431
00:42:26,123 --> 00:42:27,505
Do you think he's filthy?..

432
00:42:27,506 --> 00:42:28,998
Or you really don't like him?

433
00:42:29,694 --> 00:42:31,899
Why do you think this way?

434
00:42:32,680 --> 00:42:34,073
What I mean is..

435
00:42:34,571 --> 00:42:36,760
nothing.

436
00:42:36,761 --> 00:42:38,054
That's all.

437
00:43:50,896 --> 00:43:52,489
You want me to be in races?

438
00:43:52,490 --> 00:43:54,777
Are you sure about that?

439
00:43:54,778 --> 00:43:55,773
I don't even have a bike.

440
00:43:55,774 --> 00:43:56,770
How can I compete?

441
00:43:56,771 --> 00:43:58,061
I'll get the bike ready.

442
00:43:58,062 --> 00:44:00,151
Maintenance and repairs aren't issues either.

443
00:44:00,449 --> 00:44:02,340
All you're responsible for is riding the bike.

444
00:44:05,773 --> 00:44:07,216
Ling.

445
00:44:07,217 --> 00:44:09,903
Don't you want to be a GP rider?

446
00:44:09,904 --> 00:44:11,894
Then you must perform well in some

447
00:44:11,895 --> 00:44:14,879
international races before being qualified for GP.

448
00:44:20,153 --> 00:44:22,442
I think this time, if we're lucky, we may be able..

449
00:44:22,443 --> 00:44:24,830
to get an original bike from a manufacturer.

450
00:44:25,726 --> 00:44:26,621
Really?

451
00:44:29,407 --> 00:44:31,696
Those manufacturers are looking for some young..

452
00:44:31,697 --> 00:44:34,184
and promising riders to represent them in racers.

453
00:44:34,881 --> 00:44:35,975
What do you think?

454
00:44:42,941 --> 00:44:45,130
But I've been out of it for so long.

455
00:44:45,131 --> 00:44:46,126
No problem.

456
00:44:46,127 --> 00:44:47,767
I'll find some people, and form a team.

457
00:44:47,768 --> 00:44:49,708
I'll be in charge of training you.

458
00:44:50,106 --> 00:44:51,300
How about that?
