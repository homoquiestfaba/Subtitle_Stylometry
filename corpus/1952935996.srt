6
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:20,152
Have you ever wondered how it all gets done?

7
00:01:20,485 --> 00:01:23,417
How Santa gets in and out of millions of homes

8
00:01:23,452 --> 00:01:25,695
all in one night?

9
00:01:25,730 --> 00:01:28,986
Let's just say, he has a little help.

11
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:37,384
The operation has its challenges...

12
00:01:40,272 --> 00:01:43,335
but we're always prepared.

13
00:01:51,083 --> 00:01:53,196
Our mission statement...

14
00:01:53,231 --> 00:01:57,220
get in, get out,
never be noticed.

15
00:02:02,221 --> 00:02:04,354
I'm part of Prep & Landing...

16
00:02:04,389 --> 00:02:08,036
an elite unit of elves,
getting houses around the world

17
00:02:08,071 --> 00:02:10,591
ready for the big guy's arrival.

18
00:02:19,460 --> 00:02:22,980
The name's Wayne.
Call sign: Little Drummer Boy.

19
00:02:23,717 --> 00:02:27,004
And I've been doing this a long time.

20
00:02:28,966 --> 00:02:32,056
A really long time.

21
00:02:34,469 --> 00:02:37,912
Now I'm ready to move up
and leave this job behind.

22
00:02:40,071 --> 00:02:42,800
Oh, yeah. Next year's gonna be different.

25
00:02:55,884 --> 00:02:59,366
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
Excuse me. This spot is reserved for...

26
00:02:59,568 --> 00:03:01,140
Wayne?

27
00:03:01,141 --> 00:03:02,982
Ah, ah, ah!
No ticket this time, Waterkotte.

28
00:03:02,983 --> 00:03:05,422
You received the promotion?
I was not informed of this!

29
00:03:05,457 --> 00:03:07,270
I'm just heading over to 
Magee's office right now...

30
00:03:07,271 --> 00:03:09,770
You know, make it official.
blah, blah, blah...

31
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:12,595
You just make sure you get a
parking sticker on there pronto, mister!

32
00:03:12,630 --> 00:03:16,174
Hey, hey, hey. Scratch it,
I'll put you on the Naughty List.

33
00:03:16,209 --> 00:03:18,962
Just kidding...
but I could.

34
00:03:18,997 --> 00:03:21,827
All Prep & Landing teams report in.

35
00:03:21,862 --> 00:03:24,244
Oh, Jingle Bells, Wayne is swell,

36
00:03:24,279 --> 00:03:26,430
he's a director...

37
00:03:26,465 --> 00:03:32,017
Don't be late for our date
under the mistletoe...

38
00:03:32,519 --> 00:03:35,376
- Hey, Wayne, we're gonna miss you!
- I'll miss you, Gabe.

39
00:03:35,411 --> 00:03:36,827
It's Bryan!

40
00:03:36,828 --> 00:03:39,688
Naughty List houses coming online now.

41
00:03:40,363 --> 00:03:42,650
All coal elves check in.

42
00:03:42,685 --> 00:03:44,283
Oh, here he comes. Here he comes.

43
00:03:44,284 --> 00:03:47,197
- Hey, new boss.
- Hey, boss!

44
00:03:47,232 --> 00:03:49,111
My wife, she made you fruit cake.

45
00:03:49,112 --> 00:03:51,657
Why, thank you! 
Whoa, heavy!

46
00:03:52,205 --> 00:03:54,948
Feels more like a pound cake, huh?

47
00:03:59,350 --> 00:04:00,774
What was your name again?

48
00:04:00,775 --> 00:04:03,434
Gristletoe Joe, sir.
But my friends call me, Nancy.

49
00:04:03,469 --> 00:04:06,018
I'm gonna remember you 
when I'm in charge, Nance.

50
00:04:06,053 --> 00:04:10,475
Now you tell that lovely wife of yours
that I am gonna savor every last bite. Yeah.

51
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:14,227
- From me to you.
- Hold on. Hello?

52
00:04:14,262 --> 00:04:17,568
I'll see you at the Christmas party tomorrow.

53
00:04:17,603 --> 00:04:20,035
- Hey, Magee.
- Hello? ...Oh, yeah?

54
00:04:20,070 --> 00:04:21,857
Well, this year I'm Santa's secret Santa.

55
00:04:21,858 --> 00:04:23,758
What am I supposed to do about that, Jerry?

56
00:04:24,317 --> 00:04:26,217
Hi, Wayne.

57
00:04:26,562 --> 00:04:30,243
- Aw, did you lose a bet, sweety?
- It's my celebration tie.

58
00:04:30,278 --> 00:04:33,200
Wayne...you didn't get the promotion.

59
00:04:34,090 --> 00:04:35,837
- What?
- Peterson got it.

60
00:04:35,838 --> 00:04:38,193
- My...partner?
- Yeah.

61
00:04:38,803 --> 00:04:41,433
So, ah, no parking sticker?

62
00:04:44,667 --> 00:04:49,971
- You're disappointed!
- Oh, no, no! I'm glad for Peterson.

63
00:04:50,006 --> 00:04:53,128
What, are you crazy?
'Cause he trained by me.

64
00:04:53,163 --> 00:04:56,426
I mean, seriously, are you crazy?
I'm so glad...

65
00:04:56,461 --> 00:05:00,614
that the big guy noticed him...and not me.
So there you go.

66
00:05:00,649 --> 00:05:04,023
Well, good! 
Because now you have a new partner to train!

67
00:05:04,058 --> 00:05:05,907
Ah, Tiny? Tiny?
Ah, Tiny!

68
00:05:05,908 --> 00:05:07,449
Send him in.

69
00:05:07,450 --> 00:05:12,443
I think you'll really like him.
Top of his class at Kringle Academy.

70
00:05:15,132 --> 00:05:18,196
- Ah, a little help here.
- It was a small class.

71
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:21,260
Please?

72
00:05:24,409 --> 00:05:27,471
I'm Lanny.
Call sign: Tree Skirt.

73
00:05:27,506 --> 00:05:29,923
I'm so excited to be working with you.

74
00:05:29,958 --> 00:05:31,877
I had a poster of you on my wall growing up!

75
00:05:31,912 --> 00:05:34,891
Talk about a Christmas gift, huh?!

76
00:05:34,926 --> 00:05:39,465
Okay! Thrasher is the last transport,
so let's get a move on.

77
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:42,015
Thrasher?
Thrasher, the reindeer?

78
00:05:43,823 --> 00:05:46,240
Oh, there he is!
Great garland!

79
00:05:46,275 --> 00:05:49,787
I heard Dasher had a cousin,
but I always thought you were a myth!

80
00:05:49,822 --> 00:05:51,879
- I am a myth.
- What?

81
00:05:51,914 --> 00:05:55,939
Tell anyone I exist, and you won't exist.

82
00:05:59,074 --> 00:06:01,184
Wayne, what's Thrasher's top speed?

83
00:06:01,219 --> 00:06:04,581
Mach 2? Mach 3?
I bet it's more like Mach-a-billion!

84
00:06:04,616 --> 00:06:06,359
This is so tinsel!

85
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:10,189
Does the phrase, "Silent Night" 
mean anything to you?

86
00:06:11,446 --> 00:06:15,309
3, 2, 1...

88
00:06:27,239 --> 00:06:31,008
Wow, that house is a winter wonderland.

89
00:06:49,986 --> 00:06:51,895
We have an L-shaped living chamber.

90
00:06:52,446 --> 00:06:55,170
Two visible exits to the north.

91
00:06:55,205 --> 00:06:57,204
and to the east.

92
00:06:58,380 --> 00:07:00,692
No hidden cameras.

93
00:07:02,054 --> 00:07:05,937
Hey, you know, it seems like you've got
this really holiday...zest going.

94
00:07:05,972 --> 00:07:08,071
You- You know what?
What do you say you fly solo?

95
00:07:08,106 --> 00:07:10,119
Solo?
"Solo".

96
00:07:10,154 --> 00:07:15,899
- But, it's m-m-m-my first mission.
- You are highly trained, aren't you?

97
00:07:15,934 --> 00:07:18,363
I'll report in at regular intervals.

98
00:07:19,061 --> 00:07:20,972
I'm going upstairs.

99
00:07:21,007 --> 00:07:24,919
Right. And I'll handle cookie assessment.

100
00:07:32,521 --> 00:07:34,346
Tree Skirt to Little Drummer Boy.

101
00:07:34,347 --> 00:07:37,478
No creatures stirring.
Over!

103
00:07:48,253 --> 00:07:51,261
Stockings are hung with care.

104
00:07:51,296 --> 00:07:54,918
- Am I doing okay?
- Ah, doing fantastic!

105
00:07:56,509 --> 00:07:59,360
That's right. I'm being naughty.

106
00:08:00,224 --> 00:08:03,296
Tell your buddy Peterson to put me on his list.

107
00:08:05,045 --> 00:08:07,333
Oh, a bike!

108
00:08:07,368 --> 00:08:10,228
Oh, he's gonna be so happy!

109
00:08:18,646 --> 00:08:23,642
- Merry Christmas!
- A Christmas special! That's nice.

110
00:08:23,677 --> 00:08:26,530
Do you wanna watch a Christmas special?
You do?

111
00:08:28,111 --> 00:08:31,544
Oops! Oh, another one? 
Do you like that? I don't.

112
00:08:31,579 --> 00:08:33,856
That one?
Too bad.

113
00:08:34,710 --> 00:08:36,610
Ah, here we go.

114
00:08:44,918 --> 00:08:46,977
Ah, Little Drummer Boy...

115
00:08:47,761 --> 00:08:50,167
Ah, I could really use some advice here.

116
00:08:50,202 --> 00:08:52,400
Go with your gut, kid.

117
00:08:59,896 --> 00:09:03,296
Merry Christmas, big guy!

118
00:09:05,392 --> 00:09:07,354
Stale.

120
00:09:24,547 --> 00:09:26,260
It's Jingle Time!

121
00:09:26,261 --> 00:09:28,577
Open hangar doors.

122
00:09:32,923 --> 00:09:35,654
- Doors open.
- Cue Rosebud.

123
00:09:45,321 --> 00:09:47,098
Instruments are holly jolly.

124
00:09:47,099 --> 00:09:49,053
Rev up the engines.

125
00:09:56,671 --> 00:09:58,164
Reindeer ready to roll.

126
00:09:58,165 --> 00:10:00,359
We are go for partridge.

127
00:10:03,064 --> 00:10:05,574
He's on his way.
I've made the list, sir.

128
00:10:05,609 --> 00:10:08,310
- You checked it twice?
- Per redundancy protocol.

129
00:10:08,345 --> 00:10:09,995
Prep & Landing teams are under way.

130
00:10:09,996 --> 00:10:12,313
- Everything seems to be in proper order.
- Excellent!

131
00:10:12,348 --> 00:10:13,930
Thank you, Miss Holly.

132
00:10:13,931 --> 00:10:16,547
The partridge is in the pear tree.
We are go for launch.

133
00:10:16,582 --> 00:10:18,194
- Vehicle?
- Dash away.

134
00:10:18,195 --> 00:10:19,686
- Engines?
- Dash away.

135
00:10:19,687 --> 00:10:21,587
- Partridge?
- Dash away.

136
00:10:23,901 --> 00:10:25,803
Dash away all!

137
00:10:25,838 --> 00:10:29,370
10, 9, 8, 7...

138
00:10:29,521 --> 00:10:35,225
6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

139
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:39,829
Ho, Ho...
Go!

140
00:10:50,861 --> 00:10:52,660
Okay, people, this is it!

141
00:10:52,661 --> 00:10:56,522
364 days of preparation, 
one night of perfect execution.

142
00:10:58,842 --> 00:11:00,949
Nothing will go wrong. Nothing will go wrong. 
Nothing will...

143
00:11:00,984 --> 00:11:03,501
Sir, there's a storm alert over Sector 7.

144
00:11:03,836 --> 00:11:05,736
Oh...frostbite!

145
00:11:06,524 --> 00:11:09,596
Hi, I'm Timmy.
What's your name?

146
00:11:09,631 --> 00:11:11,773
I-I-I, ah...

147
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:13,737
I-It's Wayne.

148
00:11:13,738 --> 00:11:16,467
You're a lot smaller than 
Santa's helpers at the mall.

149
00:11:16,502 --> 00:11:18,349
Are you a baby elf?

150
00:11:18,350 --> 00:11:20,560
No, I'm not a baby!
I have a pension!

151
00:11:21,576 --> 00:11:23,016
You're squeezy.

152
00:11:23,017 --> 00:11:25,073
Little Drummer Boy,
creature stirring!

153
00:11:25,293 --> 00:11:27,417
Another one!

154
00:11:31,312 --> 00:11:34,144
Security breach.
Subject has been sparkled.

155
00:11:34,953 --> 00:11:37,669
Hey, is this one of the big guy's cookies?

156
00:11:37,704 --> 00:11:39,113
Not anymore.

157
00:11:39,114 --> 00:11:41,427
Oh, we're definitely behind schedule now!

158
00:11:41,462 --> 00:11:42,898
Then we better get going.

159
00:11:42,899 --> 00:11:47,886
But--but doesn't section code 808 state: 
"All children shall be snug in their beds"?

160
00:11:51,305 --> 00:11:54,386
So you were having a jolly holiday downstairs.

161
00:11:54,421 --> 00:11:57,291
Oh, yeah. Fa la la la la!

162
00:11:57,326 --> 00:11:59,718
What's wrong?
Don't you even care?

163
00:11:59,838 --> 00:12:03,876
I've been working Prep & Landing for 227 years,

164
00:12:03,911 --> 00:12:06,628
and believe me, the thrill is gone.

165
00:12:06,663 --> 00:12:10,409
But this the most tinsel job ever.
I mean, bringing joy to children?

166
00:12:10,444 --> 00:12:12,829
- Sorry.
- Look, Tree Skirt.

167
00:12:12,864 --> 00:12:16,380
We are just tiny ornaments on 
some gigantic tree...

168
00:12:16,415 --> 00:12:19,608
slaving away...all for what?

169
00:12:19,643 --> 00:12:22,306
"For what"?
For him.

170
00:12:22,947 --> 00:12:27,652
Just look at this face, Wayne.
Imagine the joy on this face tomorrow morning.

171
00:12:27,687 --> 00:12:32,905
Imagine all the great memories he'll pass
onto his children, and his children's children.

172
00:12:33,981 --> 00:12:36,633
The thrill may be gone for you, Wayne,

173
00:12:37,269 --> 00:12:40,132
but it's not gone for him.

174
00:12:41,424 --> 00:12:43,324
You'll learn, rookie.

175
00:12:44,195 --> 00:12:47,861
I thought you were 
"the" Prep & Landing guy, Wayne...

176
00:12:48,429 --> 00:12:51,079
but you're just a lump of coal.

177
00:12:52,045 --> 00:12:55,941
Yeah, well...
sometimes we don't get what we want.

178
00:13:02,802 --> 00:13:05,019
- Yes, dear?
- Wayne, it's Magee.

179
00:13:05,054 --> 00:13:07,389
I'm sure you've noticed,
the snowstorm is pretty bad.

180
00:13:07,424 --> 00:13:09,948
Oh, well I have now.
I mean, uh, oh...

181
00:13:09,983 --> 00:13:13,290
What do you mean? You-you-you-you're not 
on the roof? You're...you're not done?

182
00:13:13,325 --> 00:13:17,020
Oh, okay. Fine.
We have a coal in the stocking.

183
00:13:17,055 --> 00:13:19,065
- What?
- We're putting him to bed.

184
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:21,000
- Relax.
- I told you to pull it together,

185
00:13:21,006 --> 00:13:22,758
not crumble like a Christmas cookie!

186
00:13:22,759 --> 00:13:24,864
- If you have-- 
- 8 maids a-milking, this is Jingle Bell.

187
00:13:24,899 --> 00:13:26,450
Come in, 8 maids a-milking.

188
00:13:26,451 --> 00:13:29,319
- I really hate that call sign.
- Can barely hear you, Jingle Bell.

189
00:13:29,354 --> 00:13:32,233
- We are in the soup here.
- We're flying blind, man!

190
00:13:32,268 --> 00:13:34,379
Tell her we're flying blind!

191
00:13:34,414 --> 00:13:36,514
Why didn't I listen to Jerry... 

192
00:13:36,549 --> 00:13:38,449
and stay in toy design?

193
00:13:39,165 --> 00:13:42,441
Tiny, bring me Big Red.

194
00:13:46,939 --> 00:13:49,941
It's just a little snow, Magee.
I can handle it.

195
00:13:49,976 --> 00:13:52,408
You don't understand, sir.
The site's not prepped.

196
00:13:52,443 --> 00:13:54,343
We have no choice...

197
00:13:55,023 --> 00:13:56,923
Figgy Pudding.

198
00:13:57,579 --> 00:14:00,757
It's never come to that.
What about Timmy?

199
00:14:00,792 --> 00:14:02,465
Sir, with all due respect,

200
00:14:02,466 --> 00:14:05,378
there are millions of other kids 
counting on you. It's just not safe.

201
00:14:05,413 --> 00:14:07,909
We'll make it up to Timmy somehow, I promise.

202
00:14:08,832 --> 00:14:10,906
All right then.

203
00:14:10,941 --> 00:14:12,884
You heard her team.

205
00:14:20,985 --> 00:14:23,439
Figgy p-pudding?

206
00:14:23,474 --> 00:14:26,480
B-b-b-but that means the big guy's passing us by.


207
00:14:26,515 --> 00:14:29,365
What about Timmy?
What about his Christmas?

208
00:14:31,502 --> 00:14:35,567
Well, I, uh, never meant for...

209
00:14:35,602 --> 00:14:37,855
this to happen.

210
00:14:39,870 --> 00:14:43,999
This will be the best Christmas ever.

211
00:14:47,989 --> 00:14:50,577
Thanks, Wayne.

212
00:15:07,715 --> 00:15:10,639
- Magee, patch me through to the big guy.
- Wayne, it's over.

213
00:15:10,674 --> 00:15:13,454
Patch me through or I'll tell everyone
about you and Tiny!

214
00:15:13,489 --> 00:15:16,586
- Patching you through.
- Hello? This is Partridge.

215
00:15:16,621 --> 00:15:18,894
Sir, my name's Wayne from Prep & Landing.

216
00:15:20,492 --> 00:15:22,516
I need you to come to this house, sir.

217
00:15:22,551 --> 00:15:24,818
Oh, I'm afraid Magee's rerouting me, son.

218
00:15:24,853 --> 00:15:27,024
Sir, there's a child here 
that's really excited for you.

219
00:15:27,059 --> 00:15:29,827
We cannot let him down.
I can land you safely.

220
00:15:29,862 --> 00:15:32,172
I have a plan, and there is time.

221
00:15:32,207 --> 00:15:34,196
Please, sir, let me do my job.

222
00:15:34,231 --> 00:15:36,087
I can't let Timmy down.

223
00:15:36,088 --> 00:15:40,166
I was hoping you'd say that.
Let's give it a shot, my boy.

224
00:15:44,345 --> 00:15:47,901
This is the most tinsel job ever, huh, partner?

225
00:15:49,578 --> 00:15:51,810
I should never have patched him through.

226
00:15:52,523 --> 00:15:54,423
Sir!

227
00:15:54,634 --> 00:15:57,503
Roasting chestnuts!
He's turned back!

228
00:16:03,086 --> 00:16:05,155
Oh, no!

229
00:16:06,191 --> 00:16:08,091
No!

230
00:16:13,917 --> 00:16:16,512
You can't see anything in this storm!

231
00:16:16,547 --> 00:16:18,845
Except your winter wonderland.

232
00:16:34,116 --> 00:16:36,539
How are we gonna make it through all this snow?

233
00:16:36,574 --> 00:16:40,350
Laughing all the way, my friend.
Laughing all the way.

234
00:16:45,963 --> 00:16:48,518
Lanny! I need some rope!

235
00:17:00,074 --> 00:17:01,974
Is this enough?

236
00:17:10,235 --> 00:17:12,135
Light 'em up!

237
00:17:23,774 --> 00:17:25,674
Good job, Tree Skirt!

238
00:17:25,709 --> 00:17:27,609
Yes!

239
00:17:34,246 --> 00:17:36,490
I'm gonna die!

240
00:17:37,365 --> 00:17:39,265
I'm alive!

241
00:17:51,456 --> 00:17:54,772
Little Drummer Boy, Little Drummer Boy.
We don't see the landing strip.

242
00:17:54,807 --> 00:17:56,707
Almost there, sir.

244
00:18:03,687 --> 00:18:05,471
We have a visual.

245
00:18:05,472 --> 00:18:07,141
The landing zone is prepped.

246
00:18:07,142 --> 00:18:09,231
We're going in. Cut the engines.

247
00:18:14,452 --> 00:18:15,947
Come in too hot!

248
00:18:15,948 --> 00:18:19,368
It's too late to pull up, man!
It's too late to pull up!

249
00:18:19,403 --> 00:18:20,947
Keep it together, Dancer!

250
00:18:20,948 --> 00:18:22,848
Hang on!

251
00:18:25,483 --> 00:18:27,383
The tail hook!

253
00:19:07,554 --> 00:19:11,330
Um, hi. I-I don't have an appointment, uh,
but I-I was wondering if, um...

254
00:19:11,365 --> 00:19:13,908
- Go right in. He's been expecting you.
- He is? 

255
00:19:15,284 --> 00:19:17,184
Oh, well, uh... Okay.

256
00:19:17,531 --> 00:19:19,910
Hey, Wayne. You're missing the party!

257
00:19:19,945 --> 00:19:22,495
They're gonna start the gift exchange!

258
00:19:22,530 --> 00:19:26,120
No, no. You-You...You go ahead.
I'll catch up later.

259
00:19:36,959 --> 00:19:38,379
Come in, Wayne.

260
00:19:38,380 --> 00:19:42,251
Sir, I am very sorry about last night.

261
00:19:42,884 --> 00:19:46,278
If you wanna transfer me, or fire me, I...

262
00:19:46,599 --> 00:19:49,073
...I completely understand.

263
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,992
But, please...
make sure you find Lanny a new partner.

264
00:19:54,027 --> 00:19:56,555
He's a good elf, sir.

265
00:19:57,127 --> 00:20:02,173
Well, uh...that's why I assigned him to you.

266
00:20:02,838 --> 00:20:07,292
But, don't be silly, Wayne.
I'm not gonna bite your head off.

267
00:20:07,327 --> 00:20:11,219
Everyone slips onto the naughty list 
once in a while.

268
00:20:11,254 --> 00:20:13,548
I'm glad you stopped by though...

269
00:20:13,583 --> 00:20:17,602
so I could say...Merry Christmas.

270
00:20:17,637 --> 00:20:19,651
It's...It's Timmy's house!

271
00:20:19,686 --> 00:20:24,703
It's a reminder of why our job is so important.

272
00:20:24,738 --> 00:20:28,768
Now go on.
We're not getting any younger, you know.

273
00:20:34,952 --> 00:20:37,308
Thanks...Santa.

274
00:20:37,343 --> 00:20:40,559
Oh, Wayne...one more thing.

275
00:20:43,704 --> 00:20:46,213
Well?
Wha- What did he say?

276
00:20:46,248 --> 00:20:48,901
- He offered me a promotion.
- Wow!

277
00:20:48,936 --> 00:20:51,587
Director of the Nice List.

278
00:20:51,622 --> 00:20:54,053
Congratulations!

279
00:20:54,088 --> 00:20:57,107
- I turned him down.
- What?

280
00:20:57,634 --> 00:21:00,558
I'm more of a Prep & Landing guy.

281
00:21:10,438 --> 00:21:12,367
Oh! Fruit cake?!

282
00:21:13,378 --> 00:21:16,956
Thanks, Magee!
Best Christmas ever!
