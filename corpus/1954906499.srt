00:01:11,230 --> 00:01:13,280
Now, count the money carefully

3
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:14,632
Otherwise, in and out

4
00:01:17,060 --> 00:01:18,160
Let's go

5
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:20,385
Albert, you stay here with me

6
00:01:21,650 --> 00:01:23,992
What?
-- Why? We don't go nowhere, eh?

7
00:01:24,130 --> 00:01:26,836
Those Irish punks, they kiss our ass

8
00:01:27,490 --> 00:01:29,061
I'm going to go crazy, just waiting

9
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:31,330
Go crazy.
-- Shit! .. Go!

10
00:01:32,043 --> 00:01:33,607
Go on, what're you waiting for?

11
00:01:33,629 --> 00:01:35,869
Close the door behind you,
cause it's freezing.

12
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:39,440
Don't see why I can't go

13
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:32,196
Game time, Frankie.
-- No shit, McCain.

14
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:36,160
Where is it going down, Terry?
-- Back room of Charlie's Pub.

15
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:10,843
Frankie you take the back.
-- Dylan, you're with me.

16
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:13,840
Hey, you talk to me when you get inside, huh?
--You got it, Frankie.

17
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:43,149
This is going to be fun

18
00:03:44,380 --> 00:03:46,960
Hey, if something happens, Dylan,
you know I love you.

19
00:03:47,870 --> 00:03:49,396
Fuck you, Terry.

20
00:03:49,570 --> 00:03:51,214
Such a heart-breaker

21
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:53,905
#Oh, Danny boy..#

22
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:58,220
.. #The pipes, the pipes..#
-- What the hell you doing?.  ---.#. they call ..#

23
00:03:58,850 --> 00:04:01,992
I'm singing..
-- Well, shut the fuck up, and go back inside.

24
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:06,880
Hey, I know you!  Johnny Flannigan,
.. St. Mary's ..

25
00:04:08,150 --> 00:04:09,636
Yeah, I remember ..

26
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:12,647
You're that little asshole.
-- Yeah, that's me, all grown up.

27
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:15,170
Turn you ass around before I fuck you up

28
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,767
psss, you two must've been really tight

29
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:25,650
Is DiMarco afraid to deal
with us face-to-face?

30
00:04:25,701 --> 00:04:30,101
Mr. DiMarco can't be bothered
fucking around with you potato-heads.

31
00:04:31,818 --> 00:04:36,705
Well, he must be losing his mind
to trust you with $3 Million in cash.

32
00:04:42,705 --> 00:04:43,883
Talk to me Frankie

33
00:04:44,654 --> 00:04:46,938
Hey, yo, yo, freezing out here

34
00:04:47,156 --> 00:04:48,683
Let's do this thing!

35
00:04:57,418 --> 00:04:59,127
Stupid, fucken punk!

36
00:05:39,905 --> 00:05:41,592
Hey!  Police!

37
00:06:08,247 --> 00:06:09,163
You all right?

38
00:06:09,210 --> 00:06:10,560
Yeah, where's Frankie?

39
00:06:10,894 --> 00:06:12,050
Frankie!

40
00:06:14,225 --> 00:06:15,280
Dylan!

41
00:06:21,134 --> 00:06:22,072
Shit!

42
00:06:23,141 --> 00:06:26,000
- He fucked up my jacket, man.
-- I'll buy you a new one.

43
00:06:41,127 --> 00:06:42,821
Don't you fucken move

44
00:06:43,832 --> 00:06:45,425
Stay back!  Stay inside.

45
00:06:45,454 --> 00:06:45,956
Get up!

46
00:06:46,472 --> 00:06:48,007
You and me are gonna
have a little talk

47
00:06:48,043 --> 00:06:49,520
One of DiMarco's guys got away

48
00:06:49,570 --> 00:06:50,763
Get against the car

49
00:06:52,327 --> 00:06:54,109
Get the car open. get the car open.

50
00:06:57,832 --> 00:06:59,985
He's been in there an hour,
for God's sake.

51
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:02,625
Hey look, Sam
relax, huh?

52
00:07:02,901 --> 00:07:04,101
Leave the man alone

53
00:07:04,254 --> 00:07:06,952
Come on, Tony, quit dicking me around.
I know you work for DiMarco.

54
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,596
I know everything about that operation

55
00:07:08,727 --> 00:07:10,210
I need to hear you say it

56
00:07:11,978 --> 00:07:15,541
Ok, let's see what flying through
a window does to the human body.

57
00:07:15,592 --> 00:07:18,283
broken ribs, broken nose,
multiple contussions ..

58
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:20,283
Sprained ankle, ah, sprained ankle ..

59
00:07:22,538 --> 00:07:24,298
Fuck you, I know my rights

60
00:07:25,883 --> 00:07:27,214
Let me tell you something ..

61
00:07:27,687 --> 00:07:30,320
I've wasted the last three years
of my life on DiMarco.

62
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:32,887
I'm getting tired of watching him
walk in and out of courtrooms

63
00:07:32,923 --> 00:07:35,200
in his $2 K dollar suits and silk ties

64
00:07:35,883 --> 00:07:39,061
You start answering my questions or
I'm going to shove these broken ribs

65
00:07:39,112 --> 00:07:40,858
right through
your fucking lungs

66
00:07:43,069 --> 00:07:43,745
What?

67
00:07:44,676 --> 00:07:46,741
I .. I .. couldn't hear that last part.

68
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:48,043
You weren't supposed to

69
00:07:48,872 --> 00:07:50,574
oh, ok.

70
00:07:50,996 --> 00:07:53,854
What's it going to be, Tony, huh?

71
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:00,938
What's it going to be Tony .. huh?

72
00:08:01,018 --> 00:08:01,650
Huh?

73
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:02,996
DiMarco set up the whole thing

74
00:08:03,905 --> 00:08:07,025
- I was just doing what I was told.
-- Good, you hear that, Lucas?

75
00:08:07,665 --> 00:08:10,210
- Yeah.
-- You're going to swear to this in court, right?

76
00:08:10,821 --> 00:08:11,883
Right?

77
00:08:11,934 --> 00:08:12,603
Yea. Yes!

78
00:08:14,196 --> 00:08:15,265
Good

79
00:08:17,185 --> 00:08:19,200
That wasn' so bad, was it?

80
00:08:21,709 --> 00:08:23,287
Where is McCain?

81
00:08:25,192 --> 00:08:27,781
- Hey, Captain.
-- Let's cut the shit, where is he?

82
00:08:27,861 --> 00:08:30,516
ah, he's .. just .. ah ..
He's finishing up.

83
00:08:31,338 --> 00:08:32,356
Hey, Captain

84
00:08:32,669 --> 00:08:33,600
Got a confession

85
00:08:33,745 --> 00:08:36,101
Oh, ah .. listen, when I was
asking him questions

86
00:08:36,174 --> 00:08:38,749
he got a little upset
having to relive everything

87
00:08:38,785 --> 00:08:40,567
Twisted his body
hurt himself a bit

88
00:08:40,596 --> 00:08:41,170
check it out

89
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:47,185
What did you see?

90
00:08:48,072 --> 00:08:52,603
I ..  I was looking down on.
ahm, ahm, I'm always looking down

91
00:08:55,767 --> 00:08:57,563
What're you crippled? Move!

92
00:09:04,036 --> 00:09:04,770
Sit.

93
00:09:07,927 --> 00:09:09,250
Want some wine?

94
00:09:09,818 --> 00:09:11,243
Did you eat?

95
00:09:14,138 --> 00:09:15,861
Ok, what happened to the money?

96
00:09:16,050 --> 00:09:17,760
It all happened so fast

97
00:09:17,854 --> 00:09:21,410
Three fucking crazy cops
and those goddamn Irish punks

98
00:09:21,549 --> 00:09:23,250
and everybody trying
to kill each other

99
00:09:24,050 --> 00:09:26,821
Mr. DiMarco
I'm real sorry.

100
00:09:27,076 --> 00:09:28,938
That would sound
a lot better on your knees

101
00:09:29,069 --> 00:09:30,007
Vinnie

102
00:09:31,112 --> 00:09:34,530
You know we're talking
about $3 Million in cash?

103
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:35,730
You realize that?

104
00:09:37,381 --> 00:09:41,127
Mr. DiMarco, you know that
I would never steal from you.

105
00:09:42,058 --> 00:09:44,320
Of course, of course.

106
00:09:46,378 --> 00:09:47,156
Come here

107
00:09:59,287 --> 00:10:00,727
Get him out of here

108
00:10:01,301 --> 00:10:02,450
I want my money

109
00:10:03,636 --> 00:10:04,880
Find me those cops

110
00:11:57,003 --> 00:11:58,989
The court finds
that the statements

111
00:11:59,010 --> 00:12:03,120
incriminating Mr DiMarco
are inadmissible as evidence

112
00:12:03,469 --> 00:12:05,949
and cannot be used
in the criminal proceeding

113
00:12:05,992 --> 00:12:07,272
brought by the state

114
00:12:07,752 --> 00:12:09,418
These statements
were obtained

115
00:12:09,476 --> 00:12:11,512
through the use of
E X C E S S I V E  FORCE

116
00:12:12,269 --> 00:12:13,803
case dismissed

117
00:12:23,134 --> 00:12:26,356
We'll get him next time, Terry, huh?
Let's get out of here.

118
00:12:26,843 --> 00:12:29,200
I'm sick of your goddam antics

119
00:12:29,330 --> 00:12:32,174
- This hearing was a joke, sir.
-- Save it.

120
00:12:32,778 --> 00:12:34,356
You're out of control, Terry

121
00:12:34,770 --> 00:12:36,603
This isn't the first conviction we've lost

122
00:12:36,669 --> 00:12:38,167
because of your short fuse

123
00:12:38,225 --> 00:12:40,574
Now, personally
I could give a rat's ass

124
00:12:40,618 --> 00:12:42,712
about how you treat
the DiMarcos of the world

125
00:12:42,843 --> 00:12:46,014
But when you make me look bad,
we've got a problem.

126
00:12:47,185 --> 00:12:48,312
You understand?

127
00:12:50,945 --> 00:12:52,705
You gotta cool out, huh?

128
00:12:55,390 --> 00:12:56,269
Terry

129
00:12:56,705 --> 00:12:57,861
Terry

130
00:12:59,061 --> 00:13:00,203
Hold on, Terry

131
00:13:01,745 --> 00:13:03,869
Hey, listen to me

132
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:05,330
Fuck Devlin

133
00:13:05,410 --> 00:13:07,730
Even though DiMarco walked,
we almost nailed him.

134
00:13:07,730 --> 00:13:10,225
It's the third time he beats me,
Dylan, the third time.

135
00:13:10,276 --> 00:13:13,229
Yeah, well, he beat me too, but you
don't see me getting crazy about it.

136
00:13:13,374 --> 00:13:14,610
Look at him

137
00:13:18,550 --> 00:13:20,116
E X C E S S I V E
FORCE

138
00:13:50,661 --> 00:13:52,109
What the hell was that?

139
00:13:52,276 --> 00:13:54,021
I thought you said
everything above the belt

140
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:57,250
I saw the opportunity.
I couldn't help myself.

141
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:01,170
You want to play, Frankie?

142
00:14:01,316 --> 00:14:03,614
Come on. We'll play.

143
00:14:18,116 --> 00:14:19,992
Let me help you up, Frankie

144
00:14:21,937 --> 00:14:23,598
Get out of here

145
00:14:23,638 --> 00:14:25,936
Dirty, but sweet

146
00:14:25,971 --> 00:14:30,931
Misplaced Melancholies

147
00:14:31,047 --> 00:14:34,109
mann, this filly be smiling at me.

148
00:14:35,098 --> 00:14:38,196
Hey, homeboy, why don't you come
to the races with me on Saturday?

149
00:14:38,647 --> 00:14:40,385
Huh? I mean you haven't done nothing ..

150
00:14:40,437 --> 00:14:42,530
Since you and your lady
have called it

151
00:14:42,610 --> 00:14:44,530
We ain't called nothing, Frankie.

152
00:14:44,901 --> 00:14:46,894
Just needed some space, that's all.

153
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:49,650
Space

154
00:14:50,858 --> 00:14:52,901
Homeboy, you need to get laid

155
00:14:53,483 --> 00:14:55,061
Hey, how about it, man.
Why don't you, ah ..

156
00:14:55,134 --> 00:14:57,316
Why don't you come out to
some clubs with me, tonight?

157
00:14:57,570 --> 00:14:59,832
See what kind of women you can
attract hanging out with me

158
00:14:59,876 --> 00:15:00,916
Oh yeah?

159
00:15:02,581 --> 00:15:04,858
Oh, Frankie, you know
what I hate about Anna?

160
00:15:05,370 --> 00:15:06,496
What?

161
00:15:06,661 --> 00:15:10,894
She knows .. I ain't never going
to find another woman like her.

162
00:15:13,425 --> 00:15:16,698
Damn, gotta do something
about your ties, Frankie.

163
00:15:48,538 --> 00:15:50,596
You're a sick man, McCain.

164
00:15:50,676 --> 00:15:52,840
I'm not the one doing
a jig in the middle of the night.

165
00:15:53,202 --> 00:15:54,669
How are your hands?

166
00:15:54,705 --> 00:15:55,934
They're alright

167
00:15:56,058 --> 00:15:58,436
I'm telling you,
shake up your life..

168
00:15:58,872 --> 00:16:01,483
Do something crazy with it
Play music for a living.

169
00:16:01,898 --> 00:16:04,305
Are you saying what I do now
is not crazy enough?

170
00:16:04,443 --> 00:16:05,658
Getting kind of old, ain't it?

171
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:07,178
Laying awake at night

172
00:16:07,701 --> 00:16:10,065
worrying about a piece
of crap like DiMarco?

173
00:16:10,967 --> 00:16:12,138
Yeah

174
00:16:13,810 --> 00:16:15,658
..yeah, I suppose so, Jake.

175
00:16:21,141 --> 00:16:23,221
Hey, ah, did Anna call by any chance?

176
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:25,621
I thought you said your birthday
didn't mean all that much to you.

177
00:16:26,196 --> 00:16:28,923
Yeah, but it did to her.  Oh, well.

178
00:16:31,076 --> 00:16:32,938
I'm going up to my room, Jake.

179
00:17:01,658 --> 00:17:02,880
Look at this, Vin ..

180
00:17:02,967 --> 00:17:06,596
A thousand dollar gate
with a $20 lock

181
00:17:07,967 --> 00:17:14,596
<i>Lisa - who is she?
<font color="#D900D9">Susan Wood [born New Zealand]</font></i>

182
00:17:26,596 --> 00:17:28,218
Are we still going out?

183
00:17:28,356 --> 00:17:31,730
Yeah. Let's go wake up McCain
and show him

184
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:34,390
not everyone in the world
forgot his birthday

185
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:46,312
Hey, kitty

186
00:17:47,287 --> 00:17:48,560
Just a second

187
00:17:50,327 --> 00:17:52,072
This is a great song

188
00:18:00,152 --> 00:18:02,060
How are you doing?

189
00:18:09,643 --> 00:18:10,974
Do it

190
00:18:39,650 --> 00:18:41,214
Get him out of here

191
00:18:57,230 --> 00:18:58,167
Dylan?

192
00:19:03,149 --> 00:19:04,472
What a waste

193
00:19:13,430 --> 00:19:14,770
This is Dylan

194
00:19:14,850 --> 00:19:16,840
If you can deal with that,
leave a message

195
00:19:17,861 --> 00:19:19,854
Dylan, where the hell are you?

196
00:19:19,970 --> 00:19:21,920
Are you dogging me
on my birthday?

197
00:19:22,232 --> 00:19:24,138
you doing what
I think you're doing?

198
00:19:24,545 --> 00:19:27,672
Always got you smiling, you sick ..
alright, call me.

199
00:19:34,094 --> 00:19:37,316
- Don, get my stick okay?
-- Yeah, Pop.

200
00:19:40,509 --> 00:19:42,872
Okay, Detective Riley,
where's my money?

201
00:19:43,512 --> 00:19:45,265
There was no money

202
00:19:45,374 --> 00:19:49,927
only three guys left that room:
You, Frank Hawkins, and Terry McCain.

203
00:19:50,181 --> 00:19:52,210
I'm telling you, it wasn't there

204
00:19:55,527 --> 00:19:57,978
All I want is a little honesty, huh?

205
00:20:17,258 --> 00:20:18,443
No .. listen.

206
00:20:19,483 --> 00:20:20,850
I swear to God

207
00:20:20,890 --> 00:20:23,403
I swear to God, I'm gonna get
my three million bucks back.

208
00:20:23,461 --> 00:20:25,876
- Where's my money?
-- I don't know!

209
00:20:26,989 --> 00:20:28,225
Ok. The legs.

210
00:20:28,298 --> 00:20:30,327
- Can I do him?
-- Alright, come on.

211
00:20:33,832 --> 00:20:34,523
Sit.

212
00:20:34,570 --> 00:20:35,534
One or both?

213
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:36,465
Both

214
00:20:39,156 --> 00:20:40,000
Guys ..

215
00:20:40,509 --> 00:20:42,945
How can I fucken tell you,
when I don't fucken know!

216
00:20:44,152 --> 00:20:46,298
Sit .. still

217
00:20:48,029 --> 00:20:49,934
What fucking money?

218
00:21:03,025 --> 00:21:04,916
I hate all you Irish pricks

219
00:21:07,032 --> 00:21:08,298
Last chance, Detective.

220
00:21:11,723 --> 00:21:13,345
Fuck you

221
00:21:14,690 --> 00:21:16,450
ok, your mother's waiting up ..

222
00:21:16,741 --> 00:21:18,094
You know how she gets

223
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:28,298
It's Lisa, Matt Dylan's girlfriend ...

224
00:21:28,523 --> 00:21:30,189
Somebody popped her

225
00:21:40,516 --> 00:21:42,363
old lady found her
about an hour ago

226
00:21:42,458 --> 00:21:44,360
- Saw the busted door,
-- Where's Dylan?

227
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:47,345
Nobody knows

228
00:21:48,370 --> 00:21:49,396
Any ideas?

229
00:21:49,825 --> 00:21:51,694
If I did, I wouldn't be standing here

230
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:53,018
Terry ..

231
00:21:58,385 --> 00:21:59,512
That's his gun

232
00:22:00,029 --> 00:22:02,552
He wouldn't go down and pick up
a newspaper without his gun

233
00:22:02,996 --> 00:22:05,658
Maybe Dylan had made himself
some serious enemies

234
00:22:07,992 --> 00:22:08,952
What does that mean?

235
00:22:09,020 --> 00:22:10,058
come here, let me talk to you

236
00:22:10,130 --> 00:22:12,567
Hey, Terry
Take it easy out there.

237
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:18,647
Word has it DiMarco lost
$3 million on your last bust

238
00:22:18,690 --> 00:22:20,814
Bullshit ..
Bullshit on both accounts.

239
00:22:20,850 --> 00:22:21,992
Which are exactly?

240
00:22:22,058 --> 00:22:24,087
one of DiMarco's guys
got away from us that night

241
00:22:24,130 --> 00:22:25,480
Now you know the fucker
had the good sense

242
00:22:25,534 --> 00:22:26,669
.. to take the money with him.

243
00:22:27,294 --> 00:22:29,432
Secondly .. Dylan, god ..

244
00:22:29,978 --> 00:22:31,709
Dylan was
the cleanest man I knew.

245
00:22:31,883 --> 00:22:32,734
"was"?

246
00:22:36,363 --> 00:22:37,585
Dylan's dead

247
00:22:38,592 --> 00:22:39,820
We both know it

248
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:43,280
DiMarco's been an obsession
of yours for years

249
00:22:43,410 --> 00:22:44,625
I kept telling you ...

250
00:22:45,163 --> 00:22:46,203
keep it in check ..

251
00:22:46,429 --> 00:22:47,861
I just said keep it in check

252
00:22:48,101 --> 00:22:50,960
Well, you become Chief in less than a week,
you don't have to deal with my ass anymore..

253
00:22:51,010 --> 00:22:53,803
Chief or no Chief, I'm making this my priority ..

254
00:22:54,829 --> 00:22:57,403
Let's just say DiMarco's guy
got the $3 million

255
00:22:57,498 --> 00:22:59,818
and convinced DiMarco
he didn't have it

256
00:23:00,923 --> 00:23:02,654
that means he thinks
one of us took it

257
00:23:03,323 --> 00:23:06,632
What it means is he's gonna
be coming after you next, or Frankie.

258
00:23:07,527 --> 00:23:09,810
You guys stick together. Understand?

259
00:23:18,596 --> 00:23:19,461
Terry,

260
00:23:21,512 --> 00:23:22,974
.. think, this was for you

261
00:23:24,538 --> 00:23:26,065
What do you want me
to do with it?

262
00:23:33,869 --> 00:23:35,163
Come here, little guy

263
00:24:05,941 --> 00:24:07,869
These assholes
think they're funny, man

264
00:24:07,949 --> 00:24:10,080
dumping the body in
the garbage like that

265
00:24:25,621 --> 00:24:26,712
No!

266
00:24:38,058 --> 00:24:40,305
- Hey, man this is a private club.
-- This won't take long.

267
00:24:40,385 --> 00:24:41,658
You fucking deaf here?

268
00:24:52,290 --> 00:24:53,236
Who the hell are you?

269
00:24:53,330 --> 00:24:54,310
Get out of my way

270
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:08,960
I'm looking for Vinnie DiMarco

271
00:25:20,654 --> 00:25:22,247
Obviously he's not here

272
00:25:42,138 --> 00:25:43,272
Where is he?

273
00:25:43,323 --> 00:25:44,545
I don't know, man

274
00:25:47,367 --> 00:25:49,018
I'm going to ask you all,
one at a time

275
00:25:49,309 --> 00:25:51,083
Now, I'm not leaving here
until I get an answer

276
00:25:56,340 --> 00:25:57,672
That's one.

277
00:25:58,094 --> 00:26:00,581
- What about you?
-- He said he was going out.

278
00:26:04,065 --> 00:26:05,709
- Where?
-- Metro.

279
00:26:05,790 --> 00:26:07,090
That's where he hangs

280
00:26:07,716 --> 00:26:10,123
You better hope he's still
hanging when I get there.

281
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:24,414
Get that son of a bitch

282
00:26:31,556 --> 00:26:32,829
Get off of me

283
00:26:33,310 --> 00:26:34,872
Come on, Vinnie

284
00:26:51,898 --> 00:26:53,650
Regards to the old man

285
00:26:55,098 --> 00:26:56,436
Have a nice night

286
00:27:50,261 --> 00:27:52,080
How did you get in here?

287
00:27:53,934 --> 00:27:55,330
I had a set made

288
00:27:56,050 --> 00:27:57,592
Don't trust a cop

289
00:27:57,694 --> 00:27:59,156
Oh, that's right, Yvonne ..

290
00:27:59,316 --> 00:28:01,243
We're all dirty, scum-sucking pigs,

291
00:28:01,287 --> 00:28:03,054
Out to make
your life miserable.

292
00:28:03,221 --> 00:28:05,825
- I think it's time for me to go.
-- Sorry.

293
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:09,650
I'll see you Friday
at the photo shoot

294
00:28:32,130 --> 00:28:36,123
You don't just storm in here after
three months, like it's still your home.

295
00:28:37,614 --> 00:28:40,210
What are you doing out running
at night?. It's a fucked up city.

296
00:28:40,363 --> 00:28:42,960
I would have assumed by now
you would have cleaned it up.

297
00:29:08,356 --> 00:29:09,643
You need two guns now?

298
00:29:10,094 --> 00:29:11,003
That's right

299
00:29:11,985 --> 00:29:13,600
One I shoot the fucker with

300
00:29:13,701 --> 00:29:15,970
the other one takes on any
fuckers who are coming at me ..

301
00:29:16,109 --> 00:29:18,654
while I put a few more shots
into the first fucker ..

302
00:29:18,705 --> 00:29:19,970
to make sure he's dead.

303
00:29:22,203 --> 00:29:23,338
You're drunk

304
00:29:24,974 --> 00:29:26,967
I didn't expect it
to be a secret.

305
00:29:30,429 --> 00:29:32,080
He wasn't living here
when I left.

306
00:29:32,981 --> 00:29:35,614
Oh, shit. I forgot to feed it.

307
00:29:37,418 --> 00:29:38,552
And it's a she

308
00:29:47,010 --> 00:29:50,138
So you just break into my house,
get drunk, and feed your cat?

309
00:29:51,810 --> 00:29:54,436
This does not constitute a break-in

310
00:29:58,152 --> 00:30:00,996
Just .. just, take your cat and get out.

311
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:09,178
She was a present from Dylan
for my birthday

312
00:30:13,636 --> 00:30:14,574
He's dead

313
00:30:21,250 --> 00:30:24,800
They dumped his body
in a junkyard, for a joke.

314
00:30:31,832 --> 00:30:33,585
Before they blew his head off,

315
00:30:34,690 --> 00:30:36,334
they smashed his knees

316
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:44,640
His knees, for Christ's sake

317
00:30:55,345 --> 00:30:57,018
Get me some napkins

318
00:31:00,676 --> 00:31:02,305
Would you like a cookie?

319
00:31:03,825 --> 00:31:05,396
It's just not good for him

320
00:31:06,203 --> 00:31:07,680
Yeah, that's my point

321
00:31:07,876 --> 00:31:09,432
You know what I'm saying?

322
00:31:09,490 --> 00:31:10,618
You try to resist

323
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:11,156
Yeah

324
00:31:19,221 --> 00:31:20,400
What was that about?

325
00:31:20,443 --> 00:31:21,149
You

326
00:31:21,512 --> 00:31:23,709
Norman thinks you're going
to blow away DiMarco

327
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:26,320
I told him I'd cover your ass
when you did it.

328
00:31:28,596 --> 00:31:31,010
You now, man,
we had one thing going for us ..

329
00:31:31,090 --> 00:31:34,429
Now, these punks, man. They'd think
twice about killing  a cop ..

330
00:31:34,690 --> 00:31:37,120
because, they know it brings
down serious misery

331
00:31:37,345 --> 00:31:38,996
that's gone to shit now

332
00:31:39,527 --> 00:31:42,174
When a DiMarco feels that
the cops have ripped him off

333
00:31:42,203 --> 00:31:43,672
it grows him a whole new set of guts

334
00:31:44,029 --> 00:31:45,272
So I say to Devlin,

335
00:31:45,345 --> 00:31:48,770
I says, you really going to come
after us if we kill this bastard?

336
00:31:49,098 --> 00:31:49,978
What did he say?

337
00:31:50,138 --> 00:31:51,127
Nothing

338
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:55,687
Nothing. Which to my mind,
he's giving it his silent blessing..

339
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:57,883
As pissed as he may be
to give it.

340
00:31:58,363 --> 00:32:01,003
Hey, man.
Swing by my apartment, will you?

341
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:02,618
I've got to get out
of these clothes.

342
00:32:19,032 --> 00:32:21,767
Why don't you, ah, grab us a
couple of beers, alright?

343
00:32:21,810 --> 00:32:23,600
I've gotta get out of this,
we'll swing over your place ..

344
00:32:23,643 --> 00:32:26,080
- You want a sandwich or something?
-- Nah, we're drinking, not eating.

345
00:32:26,189 --> 00:32:27,978
I'll be right down

346
00:32:55,738 --> 00:32:59,294
Frankie!
Come on, let's go.

347
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:02,312
Yo! Frankie..

348
00:33:43,032 --> 00:33:45,149
You're not going to like
what you see, Captain.

349
00:34:03,803 --> 00:34:05,250
How you doing?

350
00:34:07,614 --> 00:34:11,069
You know what, Devlin,
you and my are a lot alike,

351
00:34:11,701 --> 00:34:13,556
What're you trying to say, McCaine?

352
00:34:13,790 --> 00:34:17,192
There are plenty of times,
you've looked the other way. Plenty.

353
00:34:18,523 --> 00:34:20,596
You're right
we are a lot alike

354
00:34:23,570 --> 00:34:25,541
You do what you have to do

355
00:34:30,632 --> 00:34:31,934
Terry?

356
00:34:32,203 --> 00:34:34,363
Remember, none of this conversation happened

357
00:34:57,563 --> 00:34:59,563
Okay, clean up this shit, ok.

358
00:34:59,898 --> 00:35:01,505
Get some coffee

359
00:35:26,341 --> 00:35:27,541
Hey, Tom.

360
00:35:34,421 --> 00:35:35,820
Piece of shit

361
00:35:43,156 --> 00:35:44,218
Where is he?

362
00:35:50,392 --> 00:35:52,130
You look good
wrapped in garbage

363
00:35:53,236 --> 00:35:54,385
Go get him

364
00:36:08,829 --> 00:36:10,225
Don't you move

365
00:36:15,083 --> 00:36:17,061
Let's not do anything
irrational here

366
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:19,040
Come on, I'm right here

367
00:36:19,163 --> 00:36:20,341
What do you want?

368
00:36:20,523 --> 00:36:21,738
What do I want?

369
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:25,869
I want to see the tough guy

370
00:36:26,349 --> 00:36:28,327
I want to see the guy
who smashes knees

371
00:36:28,378 --> 00:36:29,970
Shoots people in the face

372
00:36:30,298 --> 00:36:32,661
Come on!  I want to see him!

373
00:36:33,047 --> 00:36:34,698
I'm not gonna fight you

374
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:40,589
Get up

375
00:36:41,672 --> 00:36:42,523
Get up!

376
00:36:42,625 --> 00:36:43,629
Please ..

377
00:36:44,620 --> 00:36:45,620
.. please.

378
00:36:45,701 --> 00:36:47,781
- Let's make sure it stops right here.
-- Shut up!

379
00:36:49,607 --> 00:36:50,749
Don't  kill me

380
00:36:52,014 --> 00:36:53,796
Die with a little dignity

381
00:36:54,021 --> 00:36:56,443
You keep the money, okay?
.. keep the money.

382
00:36:59,941 --> 00:37:01,265
Don't kill me

383
00:37:04,007 --> 00:37:05,476
Jesus ..

384
00:37:07,090 --> 00:37:08,509
You're pathetic

385
00:37:52,734 --> 00:37:54,792
Thought we'd drop by for a visit

386
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:57,549
I don't have any milk
for the cat

387
00:37:57,607 --> 00:38:00,487
She's fine.
How about you?

388
00:38:03,134 --> 00:38:04,836
I heard about Frankie ..

389
00:38:06,167 --> 00:38:07,709
What's happening, Terry?

390
00:38:14,116 --> 00:38:15,905
You want to talk about it?

391
00:38:26,094 --> 00:38:27,738
Kids grow up in this city ..

392
00:38:28,203 --> 00:38:30,225
knowing things
are rigged, and fixed

393
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:32,298
It's just a given

394
00:38:33,229 --> 00:38:34,865
I don't know,
I guess I grew up weird

395
00:38:34,909 --> 00:38:36,640
I wasn't going
to accept that shit.

396
00:38:39,287 --> 00:38:41,134
I went to kill DiMarco
last night.

397
00:38:42,567 --> 00:38:43,578
And?

398
00:38:44,138 --> 00:38:45,629
He wasn't home

399
00:38:47,112 --> 00:38:48,283
Terry

400
00:38:48,909 --> 00:38:49,752
What?

401
00:38:50,305 --> 00:38:51,789
He was pathetic

402
00:38:52,414 --> 00:38:54,414
So pathetic, I couldn't do it.

403
00:38:54,989 --> 00:38:56,465
You bring your enemies
to their knees

404
00:38:56,530 --> 00:38:58,603
They're not supposed to jump
down there on their own.

405
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:01,883
Let's get the hell
out of here

406
00:39:01,963 --> 00:39:03,978
take a vacation
What do you say?

407
00:39:04,021 --> 00:39:05,032
Just like that?

408
00:39:05,112 --> 00:39:06,414
I haven't seen you
in three months

409
00:39:06,450 --> 00:39:07,920
Now you want
to go away together?

410
00:39:07,956 --> 00:39:10,014
- Sure. Why not?
-- Ok.

411
00:39:10,043 --> 00:39:11,876
It's gotta be somewhere pretty warm ..

412
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:13,949
and someplace
pretty expensive

413
00:39:14,232 --> 00:39:17,156
like the Caribbean, St. Bart's or something..

414
00:39:17,265 --> 00:39:18,138
Terry?

415
00:39:19,080 --> 00:39:20,240
Excuse me

416
00:39:24,596 --> 00:39:25,665
Oh, god

417
00:39:27,178 --> 00:39:28,552
Somebody killed DiMarco

418
00:39:28,603 --> 00:39:30,560
What?
Terry

419
00:39:41,469 --> 00:39:43,229
Would you like a drink, Mr. Devlin?

420
00:39:43,272 --> 00:39:44,400
Lime and soda

421
00:39:50,887 --> 00:39:52,058
Sit down

422
00:39:59,127 --> 00:40:00,981
You are out of
your fucking mind.

423
00:40:01,061 --> 00:40:02,880
I called your office
three times.

424
00:40:03,629 --> 00:40:06,530
You know I have the DA's office
sitting directly behind me.

425
00:40:07,265 --> 00:40:08,720
I didn't kill DiMarco

426
00:40:10,029 --> 00:40:11,709
can I get you a drink?

427
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:12,414
No

428
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:13,876
You ready to order now?

429
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:15,316
No, I'll call you

430
00:40:16,472 --> 00:40:18,552
What do you mean, you didn't kill him,
I got two witnesses.

431
00:40:18,603 --> 00:40:20,712
Same guys you kicked the
shit out of, remember?

432
00:40:20,843 --> 00:40:22,785
I was there, but I didn't kill him

433
00:40:24,101 --> 00:40:25,650
Don't fucken lie to me, Terry

434
00:40:25,810 --> 00:40:27,934
I told you I'd protect you
Don't lie to me.

435
00:40:28,021 --> 00:40:30,390
Have I ever lied to you?
Have I?

436
00:40:32,276 --> 00:40:34,341
Look
I'm innocent.

437
00:40:35,345 --> 00:40:37,221
Then we haven't got a problem

438
00:40:39,830 --> 00:40:41,738
I need a couple
of days on my own

439
00:40:41,832 --> 00:40:43,345
to find out what
the hell's going on

440
00:40:45,178 --> 00:40:47,178
Get your ass out of here
before I have to arrest it.

441
00:40:49,367 --> 00:40:50,487
Thank you

442
00:41:12,087 --> 00:41:14,785

-- They're talking about you on the radio..

451
00:41:40,392 --> 00:41:40,930
What?

452
00:41:41,265 --> 00:41:43,687
You'e been named as
a suspect in DiMarco's murder

453
00:41:44,340 --> 00:41:45,534
Terrance McCain

454
00:41:45,745 --> 00:41:48,094
linked to the high-fashion model, Anna Gilmour,

455
00:41:50,360 --> 00:41:51,178
Give me the phone

456
00:41:58,152 --> 00:41:59,243
They're gonna get her killed

457
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:02,436
Come on, baby, pick up

458
00:42:04,167 --> 00:42:05,018
It's her machine

459
00:42:27,018 --> 00:42:29,869
Scaring the shit out of someone
is not the why to protect them.

460
00:42:29,912 --> 00:42:31,476
Believe me, I'll never do it again.

461
00:42:31,643 --> 00:42:33,192
You should be proud of me

462
00:42:33,258 --> 00:42:34,778
I remembered everything
you taught me.

463
00:42:35,163 --> 00:42:36,661
I don't remember
teaching you anything

464
00:42:36,712 --> 00:42:38,029
about punching me in the mouth

465
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,534
Relax. My agent
is sending me photos.

466
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:45,141
Anna, wait a minute.
Get away from the door.

467
00:42:45,178 --> 00:42:46,938
I won't open it
I'll just look.

468
00:42:48,698 --> 00:42:50,109
It is the messenger guy

469
00:42:50,727 --> 00:42:51,818
Hi, come in

470
00:42:52,734 --> 00:42:54,072
You'll have to sign right here

471
00:42:54,269 --> 00:42:55,178
At the bottom?

472
00:42:58,290 --> 00:42:59,330
Terrance!

473
00:43:12,116 --> 00:43:13,680
What is your jaw made of?

474
00:43:23,381 --> 00:43:24,290
Who was he?

475
00:43:24,414 --> 00:43:26,429
two-bit fucken gangster DiMarco hired

476
00:43:26,756 --> 00:43:27,927
DiMarco's dead

477
00:43:28,007 --> 00:43:30,545
His son.
He came after you to get at me.

478
00:43:32,341 --> 00:43:34,370
I have to get you out of here
for a few days

479
00:43:38,814 --> 00:43:40,145
You all right?

480
00:44:03,570 --> 00:44:04,567
It's amazing

481
00:44:05,301 --> 00:44:07,687
All that's been going on
and we end up back here.

482
00:44:11,978 --> 00:44:14,116
We had some good times
in this house.

483
00:44:14,974 --> 00:44:17,607
Sneaking down to hide
Christmas presents

484
00:44:18,370 --> 00:44:20,203
making love under the tree

485
00:44:20,589 --> 00:44:21,207
Yeah

486
00:44:22,341 --> 00:44:24,843
Making love was the
only way we related, Terry.

487
00:44:25,600 --> 00:44:26,829
Damn good why to relate

488
00:44:28,130 --> 00:44:30,501
Yeah, a good bust over a good fuck any day, right?

489
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:33,061
I was being an asshole
when I said that.

490
00:44:34,901 --> 00:44:36,552
Shame I didn't
know that at the time

491
00:44:48,574 --> 00:44:50,043
It had gotten out of hand

492
00:44:50,780 --> 00:44:52,305
I was thinking about you
all the time.

493
00:44:52,683 --> 00:44:55,098
I was thinking about you
before I went in on a bust

494
00:44:55,876 --> 00:44:58,043
So I made you feel less
like a tough guy?

495
00:44:59,512 --> 00:45:00,880
It's the first thing
in my life ..

496
00:45:00,923 --> 00:45:02,320
that I didn't have
the balls for.

497
00:45:03,956 --> 00:45:05,061
Until now.

498
00:45:06,836 --> 00:45:08,174
It's just you and me

499
00:45:25,847 --> 00:45:28,647
Hello?
Hold on.

500
00:45:31,818 --> 00:45:33,163
Phone for you

501
00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:37,840
Yeah?

502
00:45:37,890 --> 00:45:39,621
What the fuck you doing to me?
Huh?

503
00:45:39,781 --> 00:45:41,352
I thought you were gonna
buy me some time.

504
00:45:42,014 --> 00:45:43,665
DiMarco had friends
in the media.

505
00:45:45,192 --> 00:45:46,400
His son knew who to call ..

506
00:45:46,443 --> 00:45:48,130
This is Chicago, for Christ's sake.

507
00:45:48,196 --> 00:45:48,981
Where are you?

508
00:45:49,796 --> 00:45:51,134
Look, not on the phone..

509
00:45:51,389 --> 00:45:53,716
Well, how the hell are
we going to talk, McCain?

510
00:45:53,752 --> 00:45:55,338
Just tell me where to meet you

511
00:45:55,854 --> 00:45:57,090
I don't know..

512
00:45:57,600 --> 00:45:59,250
ahh, Christ ..

513
00:45:59,490 --> 00:46:02,785
What about the ahh train repair shop
on Wilson.

514
00:46:02,850 --> 00:46:03,934
the north end parking lot?

515
00:46:03,992 --> 00:46:04,778
Yeah. What time?

516
00:46:05,309 --> 00:46:07,818
10:00 O'clock,
I gotta go.

517
00:46:11,214 --> 00:46:12,654
Something wrong, honey?

518
00:46:13,156 --> 00:46:14,807
When isn't something wrong?

519
00:46:20,858 --> 00:46:23,527
I gotta go back into the city
I'll be gone a couple of hours

520
00:46:23,549 --> 00:46:23,978
that's all

521
00:46:34,218 --> 00:46:37,112
Wait a minute,
come here.

522
00:46:40,320 --> 00:46:41,890
I want you to feel something

523
00:46:42,094 --> 00:46:44,109
- ah, Terry,
-- I want you to feel it.

524
00:46:44,160 --> 00:46:46,100
Terry, that boy can see us

525
00:46:48,560 --> 00:46:50,916
I want you to take it out
.. slow.

526
00:46:54,669 --> 00:46:57,105
- .. Terry ..
-- Go on, do it.

527
00:47:02,821 --> 00:47:03,970
Good girl

528
00:47:05,178 --> 00:47:07,636
Now when I get home tonight,
I'm gonna teach you how to shoot it.

529
00:49:01,670 --> 00:49:02,727
Damn

530
00:49:06,872 --> 00:49:07,883
Shit

531
00:49:34,317 --> 00:49:35,614
that way

532
00:49:48,741 --> 00:49:50,290
Game time, buddy

533
00:50:00,029 --> 00:50:01,323
Give it up

534
00:50:01,389 --> 00:50:02,574
Fuck you

535
00:50:02,670 --> 00:50:04,341
Oh, that's original

536
00:50:13,690 --> 00:50:15,112
Who sent you?

537
00:50:16,596 --> 00:50:19,454
There's enough juice in this
thing to move an entire train

538
00:50:19,534 --> 00:50:20,589
Who sent you?

539
00:51:06,880 --> 00:51:08,152
Yeah?

540
00:51:10,407 --> 00:51:11,723
I heard

541
00:51:12,552 --> 00:51:14,712
It was as much your idea
as it was mine,

542
00:51:14,756 --> 00:51:16,116
Relax, I'll take care of it

543
00:51:17,498 --> 00:51:19,083
All I need to do is find him

544
00:51:20,334 --> 00:51:21,461
Really?

545
00:51:24,785 --> 00:51:26,698
And nobody else knows
about this place?

546
00:51:28,698 --> 00:51:30,400
Good .. good.

547
00:51:31,374 --> 00:51:32,298
Yeah

548
00:51:48,414 --> 00:51:50,334
About time
you paid your respects

549
00:51:50,749 --> 00:51:52,567
Respects, Vinnie? no

550
00:51:54,880 --> 00:51:57,403
Everybody's got something
crooked in their family tree.

551
00:51:57,861 --> 00:52:00,676
Every Irishman who's a cop
had some uncle that's a hood

552
00:52:00,741 --> 00:52:02,640
that did some favor
for some Italian.

553
00:52:03,600 --> 00:52:04,843
What I'm telling you is ..

554
00:52:04,887 --> 00:52:06,596
any business between
your father and me

555
00:52:06,836 --> 00:52:08,494
was as a typical
part of this city

556
00:52:08,530 --> 00:52:10,123
as the Cubs to Wrigley Field

557
00:52:13,578 --> 00:52:16,021
That's enough, Tommy!

558
00:52:19,229 --> 00:52:20,923
It's about an hour out

559
00:52:21,432 --> 00:52:23,120
Hey, don't underestimate this guy

560
00:52:23,607 --> 00:52:25,490
Like the three specialists did?

561
00:52:26,298 --> 00:52:28,196
Three specialists
you brought in?

562
00:52:28,829 --> 00:52:30,981
The ones they pulled
out of the train yard?

563
00:52:31,287 --> 00:52:33,447
Just a small town
we're living in

564
00:52:33,949 --> 00:52:36,043
The glory days are over, Vinnie

565
00:52:36,327 --> 00:52:38,145
What's left of Little ltaly?

566
00:52:38,210 --> 00:52:40,872
See what you did?
You know what's left?

567
00:52:40,930 --> 00:52:42,589
One city block

568
00:52:44,501 --> 00:52:47,898
Don't even dream alone at night
of fucking with me.

569
00:53:09,432 --> 00:53:10,974
How's it going, Sam?

570
00:53:11,098 --> 00:53:13,665
Terry, what do the hell're you doing?

571
00:53:13,760 --> 00:53:16,320
Devlin's got every cop
in the city out after you

572
00:53:16,720 --> 00:53:18,436
Shoot to kill, is that the order?

573
00:53:19,250 --> 00:53:21,781
God!
you're bleeding.

574
00:53:23,861 --> 00:53:26,480
Devlin set me up.
Why?

575
00:53:27,570 --> 00:53:29,345
Did he kill DiMarco?
is that what it is?

576
00:53:31,570 --> 00:53:33,694
Come on, Sam,
I'm asking as a friend.

577
00:53:37,694 --> 00:53:40,901
All I know is DiMarco
and Devlin go way back ..

578
00:53:41,432 --> 00:53:44,043
Back to when Devlin
was working the streets

579
00:53:44,843 --> 00:53:45,992
He was on the take?

580
00:53:46,603 --> 00:53:48,523
A lot of us were back then

581
00:53:50,254 --> 00:53:52,261
But it was a long time ago

582
00:53:52,807 --> 00:53:54,770
If he was still involved
with DiMarco ..

583
00:53:54,821 --> 00:53:56,770
I swear to God, I don't know.

584
00:53:57,185 --> 00:53:58,552
Of course he was, Sam

585
00:53:59,156 --> 00:54:00,814
that's why he wanted
DiMarco dead

586
00:54:01,643 --> 00:54:03,381
He was becoming
Chief of Police

587
00:54:03,418 --> 00:54:05,505
He had to get the scum
off the bottom of his shoes.

588
00:54:09,600 --> 00:54:11,920
I did everything he wanted me to
but pull the trigger.

589
00:54:13,869 --> 00:54:15,556
And now, I'm the one loose end

590
00:54:16,014 --> 00:54:18,240
You gotta go
over his head, Terry

591
00:54:18,500 --> 00:54:20,836
You gotta find somebody
you can trust.

592
00:54:23,869 --> 00:54:25,192
I trust nobody

593
00:54:26,574 --> 00:54:28,814
I'm so sorry, sorry

594
00:54:29,636 --> 00:54:30,538
Hold still

595
00:54:37,214 --> 00:54:38,574
Let me do that

596
00:55:04,570 --> 00:55:20,570
<i>Anna Gilmour - who is she?
<font color="#D900D9">Charlotte LEWIS (1967) [England]</font></i>

597
00:55:36,327 --> 00:55:37,440
Thank you

598
00:55:38,269 --> 00:55:41,934
It is time that the people
of this city stop accepting ..

599
00:55:42,320 --> 00:55:44,909
that there will always be
corruption in Chicago

600
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:47,258
I don't accept it

601
00:55:48,189 --> 00:55:49,876
And now that
I'm Chief of Police,

602
00:55:49,963 --> 00:55:53,643
what I accept or don't accept
becomes the reality.

603
00:56:01,069 --> 00:56:03,440
There have always been members
of this department ..

604
00:56:03,483 --> 00:56:05,214
and, yes, if you look
in the news right now

605
00:56:05,250 --> 00:56:07,149
there still are members
of this department

606
00:56:07,250 --> 00:56:08,952
who create violence

607
00:56:09,301 --> 00:56:11,818
It is true that the use
of  E X C E S S I V E   FORCE

608
00:56:11,840 --> 00:56:12,996
has been tolerated

609
00:56:13,040 --> 00:56:16,843
It has been tacitly condoned
and until now, undisciplined

610
00:56:19,869 --> 00:56:22,567
To even begin to deal
with this problem

611
00:56:22,807 --> 00:56:24,632
we have to get to the core

612
00:56:25,789 --> 00:56:27,978
Wake up,
get up.

613
00:56:28,043 --> 00:56:30,472
And the core of the problem
is fundamentally

614
00:56:30,792 --> 00:56:34,930
a question of supervision,
management, and leadership

615
00:56:44,960 --> 00:56:46,770
Shit. Where's the gun
I gave you?

616
00:56:46,807 --> 00:56:47,600
Downstairs

617
00:56:47,636 --> 00:56:48,618
Stay here

618
00:56:49,549 --> 00:56:50,560
Terry

619
00:57:46,443 --> 00:57:47,716
Don't stop

620
00:57:52,429 --> 00:57:54,021
Get in. Hurry up

621
00:57:54,407 --> 00:57:56,385
Don't move till I come get you,
you hear me?

622
00:57:56,436 --> 00:57:57,229
Here. Take that.

623
00:58:46,210 --> 00:58:48,698
What do you know?
You're a natural.

624
00:58:48,727 --> 00:58:50,363
What? What? come on

625
00:58:50,538 --> 00:58:52,210
Son of a bitch

626
00:58:54,021 --> 00:58:54,821
Mario

627
00:58:58,436 --> 00:58:59,941
What are you
fucking looking at?

628
00:59:00,123 --> 00:59:01,374
Go find him

629
01:00:33,003 --> 01:00:34,341
Hey, Nick

630
01:00:36,138 --> 01:00:37,243
Nicky

631
01:00:44,480 --> 01:00:46,356
It's all right come here

632
01:01:17,476 --> 01:01:19,476
What about me standing here
in one piece

633
01:01:19,512 --> 01:01:21,010
scares the shit
out of you, Jake?

634
01:01:21,098 --> 01:01:22,465
What are you talking about?

635
01:01:22,501 --> 01:01:25,381
I turn around, and out of nowhere
you're standing there in the dark.

636
01:01:29,520 --> 01:01:31,032
Vinnie DiMarco and his boys

637
01:01:31,069 --> 01:01:33,425
paid me a little visit
this morning out in the country.

638
01:01:34,632 --> 01:01:37,309
only three people knew
about Anna's farmhouse

639
01:01:37,992 --> 01:01:40,247
Dylan, Frankie ..

640
01:01:41,330 --> 01:01:44,189
and you, Jake. Nobody else.

641
01:01:44,218 --> 01:01:47,069
Not, not  Devlin .. nobody

642
01:01:48,269 --> 01:01:50,821
That you could be even thinking
what you're thinking ..

643
01:01:51,454 --> 01:01:52,938
Dylan and Frankie are dead

644
01:01:53,432 --> 01:01:54,530
Aw, man

645
01:01:58,836 --> 01:01:59,970
Tell me, Jake

646
01:02:00,690 --> 01:02:02,938
You and Devlin got something going?
Is that what it is?

647
01:02:03,345 --> 01:02:04,676
Fuck you

648
01:02:10,269 --> 01:02:11,476
Tear the place up ..

649
01:02:12,247 --> 01:02:13,141
Go on!

650
01:02:14,312 --> 01:02:17,738
Only do yourself a favor, man
Don't bust up the piano..

651
01:02:17,985 --> 01:02:20,029
cause then you won't have
anything to play your music on.

652
01:02:20,865 --> 01:02:22,909
When you think you got
a problem with somebody

653
01:02:23,316 --> 01:02:25,032
that's when you feel
like you're at your best

654
01:02:25,418 --> 01:02:27,861
You know that game
You're an artist at it

655
01:02:28,400 --> 01:02:30,327
that's what you've been
refining in yourself

656
01:02:30,887 --> 01:02:34,465
Look where it's got you
This ain't your town..

657
01:02:35,141 --> 01:02:37,607
or Devlin's
or Vinnie DiMarco's

658
01:02:37,927 --> 01:02:40,887
There were people here
before you Irish and Italians

659
01:02:42,836 --> 01:02:45,054
Now, if you're not gonna
bloody me up, McCain

660
01:02:45,098 --> 01:02:47,432
then, please,
get the fuck out of my club

661
01:05:12,174 --> 01:05:14,814
Hey,
you're late.

662
01:05:15,730 --> 01:05:18,072
check-out time was 1:00 o'clock, huh?

663
01:05:18,938 --> 01:05:20,494
Yeah, yeah, that's right

664
01:05:20,552 --> 01:05:24,647
Misplaced Melancholies,
all right? To, ahh, to win.

665
01:05:30,574 --> 01:05:31,512
Get the fuck out

666
01:05:34,938 --> 01:05:36,276
I love you. Get the fuck out

667
01:05:44,821 --> 01:05:46,625
Here's a birth certificate
for the newly born

668
01:05:47,185 --> 01:05:48,843
passport, and I want my ticket

669
01:05:52,349 --> 01:05:54,720
Now, this is very
interesting, you know

670
01:05:54,778 --> 01:05:58,014
but I won't be working
for a living next time around

671
01:05:58,836 --> 01:06:00,443
So, where's my fucking money?

672
01:06:00,800 --> 01:06:02,829
The money's safely hidden,
Frankie

673
01:06:02,996 --> 01:06:05,352
Don't sweat it,
but we got a problem

674
01:06:06,138 --> 01:06:08,298
DiMarco's kid screwed up..

675
01:06:08,581 --> 01:06:09,970
McCain is still out there

676
01:06:10,240 --> 01:06:11,818
- Now you got a problem
-- nah, ah

677
01:06:11,949 --> 01:06:13,010
Yeah, yeah, you do

678
01:06:13,301 --> 01:06:15,207
Now, you got a lot
of guys on the force

679
01:06:15,265 --> 01:06:16,894
who'll do any shit
for you, man

680
01:06:17,578 --> 01:06:20,683
You even got me a dead body
to blow up, huh?

681
01:06:21,018 --> 01:06:22,007
Not now,

682
01:06:22,450 --> 01:06:24,109
Not now that I'm police chief

683
01:06:24,749 --> 01:06:26,218
You'll have to kill
your friend

684
01:06:27,665 --> 01:06:28,538
You're dead

685
01:06:28,807 --> 01:06:31,170
So it's not exactly gonna
screw up your life, is it?

686
01:06:32,545 --> 01:06:34,290
I can't .. I can't go after McCain

687
01:06:36,320 --> 01:06:37,810
Don't be so afraid of him,
Frankie

688
01:06:38,996 --> 01:06:40,487
Listen, you'll have
the jump on him

689
01:06:41,338 --> 01:06:44,203
It'll take him a few seconds to
realize he's not seeing a ghost

690
01:06:45,309 --> 01:06:47,621
I'm not afraid of him, man
I'm not afraid of anybody

691
01:06:47,687 --> 01:06:50,232
I just don't wipe out
my friends

692
01:06:50,581 --> 01:06:53,178
Yeah, well, unfortunately,
McCain did the unexpected

693
01:06:53,214 --> 01:06:55,258
and didn't blow
DiMarco's head off, did he?

694
01:06:56,450 --> 01:06:58,050
I would have bet money
on him, man

695
01:06:58,087 --> 01:07:00,487
I would have bet everything that
he would've taken out DiMarco

696
01:07:00,807 --> 01:07:04,552
You did bet, and you lost,
you lost half of $3 Million.

697
01:07:04,647 --> 01:07:07,003
Hey, don't fuck with me, Devlin

698
01:07:07,367 --> 01:07:08,596
You can win it back

699
01:07:08,843 --> 01:07:10,240
You know him
better than anybody

700
01:07:10,450 --> 01:07:11,469
You'll find him easy

701
01:07:11,709 --> 01:07:13,912
So, you take him out
and you take him out fast

702
01:07:15,316 --> 01:07:17,265
Because if I go down,
you're gonna go down with me

703
01:07:19,738 --> 01:07:20,960
Do the right thing

704
01:09:26,909 --> 01:09:28,494
Misplaced Melancholies

705
01:09:33,076 --> 01:09:33,978
Frankie

706
01:10:00,814 --> 01:10:02,421
Hey, it's me
leave a message

707
01:10:03,309 --> 01:10:05,287
Terry, I'm at Yvonne's loft

708
01:10:05,330 --> 01:10:07,207
We're gonna go ahead with
the photo shoot tonight

709
01:10:07,723 --> 01:10:10,341
I'm worried about you
call me soon as you can

710
01:10:10,560 --> 01:10:11,680
I love you

711
01:10:25,076 --> 01:10:26,065
Jake

712
01:10:26,763 --> 01:10:28,509
Jake.
Hell, man ..

713
01:10:28,560 --> 01:10:30,581
You know, I didn't think
anybody was here

714
01:10:31,352 --> 01:10:32,930
It's good to see you, buddy

715
01:10:34,385 --> 01:10:36,967
You know, I was supposed
to meet McCain

716
01:10:37,010 --> 01:10:39,709
but I couldn't remember
the chick's address

717
01:10:39,760 --> 01:10:41,992
You look pretty good
for a dead man, Frankie

718
01:10:42,632 --> 01:10:45,018
Trust me, it's a long story

719
01:10:45,658 --> 01:10:46,407
Give me that

720
01:10:48,654 --> 01:10:50,487
We'll fill you in on it
later, all right?

721
01:10:50,661 --> 01:10:51,505
Now the piece

722
01:10:57,149 --> 01:10:58,509
Let's go downstairs

723
01:10:59,985 --> 01:11:02,465
Sure .. sure.

724
01:11:10,981 --> 01:11:12,741
Let's call the police, Frankie

725
01:11:14,036 --> 01:11:15,156
Sit down

726
01:11:23,534 --> 01:11:26,560
Shit .. shit!

727
01:11:27,607 --> 01:11:28,676
Fuck!

728
01:12:15,243 --> 01:12:16,160
Jake

729
01:12:18,945 --> 01:12:20,996
Jake ..
Jesus.

730
01:12:21,781 --> 01:12:22,749
Jake

731
01:12:23,585 --> 01:12:26,072
oh, here come on
Hold it. Hold that

732
01:12:26,116 --> 01:12:28,334
Give me your hand
Push on that

733
01:12:29,352 --> 01:12:30,581
Don't move

734
01:12:36,036 --> 01:12:37,280
This is Detective McCain

735
01:12:37,330 --> 01:12:39,461
I need an ambulance
at the Deja Vu Jazz club

736
01:12:39,498 --> 01:12:42,109
1125 Bleeker.
A man's been shot

737
01:12:44,545 --> 01:12:46,814
Here, you,
keep this against it

738
01:12:47,570 --> 01:12:48,749
Frankie

739
01:12:48,814 --> 01:12:50,181
I know.  I know.

740
01:12:50,218 --> 01:12:51,752
Listen, you gotta
hang in there, man

741
01:12:51,847 --> 01:12:53,141
you're going to be alright

742
01:12:53,629 --> 01:12:54,712
You gotta go

743
01:12:54,938 --> 01:12:56,974
I'm not going anywhere
I'm staying right here

744
01:12:57,010 --> 01:12:58,320
He's after Anna

745
01:12:58,363 --> 01:13:00,385
Yeah, well, Anna ain't home
don't worry about it.

746
01:13:00,436 --> 01:13:01,410
Yvonne

747
01:13:10,516 --> 01:13:13,563
Go on .. go on.

748
01:13:32,785 --> 01:13:34,727
Sam.
Hold on. Hold on.

749
01:13:34,763 --> 01:13:35,992
Frankie Hawkins is alive

750
01:13:36,050 --> 01:13:37,381
Relax. Don't exert yourself.

751
01:13:37,440 --> 01:13:39,534
I'm telling you the truth
McCain went after him

752
01:13:39,563 --> 01:13:41,454
He's gonna need some backup.
Now get your asses over there.

753
01:13:41,483 --> 01:13:42,654
Get him outta here

754
01:13:43,818 --> 01:13:44,923
Devlin

755
01:13:51,272 --> 01:13:52,312
Yeah

756
01:13:54,770 --> 01:13:56,014
What did he say?

757
01:13:56,356 --> 01:13:57,920
He mentioned you, Raymond.

758
01:13:58,545 --> 01:14:01,105
Where was he shot,
in the brain?

759
01:14:01,229 --> 01:14:02,487
He's in shock

760
01:14:02,589 --> 01:14:04,429
Go to the hospital
Keep him quiet

761
01:14:04,785 --> 01:14:05,803
What do you mean?

762
01:14:07,316 --> 01:14:09,672
I didn't mean put a bullet
in him, lieutenant

763
01:14:09,876 --> 01:14:11,076
Seal the room off

764
01:14:11,680 --> 01:14:13,774
make sure no one goes in
until he comes out of it

765
01:14:32,450 --> 01:14:34,523
Yvonne, take a look
at the lighting?  Yvonne?

766
01:14:39,338 --> 01:14:42,298
Terry, is everything ok?

767
01:14:44,196 --> 01:14:45,709
I didn't know you were coming

768
01:14:45,760 --> 01:14:47,461
Get everybody out right now

769
01:14:48,007 --> 01:14:50,145
I want you to take
everybody out of here

770
01:14:50,174 --> 01:14:52,181
Go out the back door
Just do it right now

771
01:14:52,312 --> 01:14:53,185
ok

772
01:14:54,356 --> 01:14:56,523
Yvonne, come on
Let's do what he says

773
01:14:59,941 --> 01:15:01,141
Smile, Terry.

774
01:15:03,658 --> 01:15:05,447
You're not gonna shoot me
in the back, Frankie

775
01:15:05,665 --> 01:15:07,010
You don't know that

776
01:15:07,447 --> 01:15:09,120
The grave changes a man

777
01:15:09,861 --> 01:15:11,440
I'm betting
you're the same man

778
01:15:11,927 --> 01:15:13,905
You won't shoot me
in the face, either

779
01:15:14,298 --> 01:15:17,760
Don't gamble, all right?
now, that's my thing

780
01:15:18,109 --> 01:15:19,956
You may not be so good at it

781
01:15:21,389 --> 01:15:23,170
Drop the gun, Terry

782
01:15:24,050 --> 01:15:26,458
Don't fuck with me
Man, drop the gun

783
01:15:26,480 --> 01:15:27,076
Ok

784
01:15:28,989 --> 01:15:32,327
Here it is,
ok?

785
01:15:33,323 --> 01:15:34,661
Come on, partner

786
01:15:35,221 --> 01:15:36,327
Drop the other one

787
01:15:40,436 --> 01:15:42,472
Now, just take it easy,
Frankie

788
01:15:43,069 --> 01:15:44,174
Take it easy?

789
01:15:45,549 --> 01:15:47,483
You didn't kill DiMarco, man

790
01:15:47,963 --> 01:15:49,825
Goddamn it,
you didn't kill him

791
01:15:49,963 --> 01:15:50,894
So you did

792
01:15:51,280 --> 01:15:52,785
What was I gonna do, man?

793
01:15:53,018 --> 01:15:56,829
Sit around and wait for him to
do to me what he did to Dylan?

794
01:15:57,207 --> 01:15:58,589
You took his money, Frankie

795
01:15:59,621 --> 01:16:00,843
I tripped over it

796
01:16:01,003 --> 01:16:04,523
I got knocked on my ass by
$3 Million in cold, hard cash

797
01:16:04,596 --> 01:16:07,534
I figured, what the hell,
man, roll with it, alright

798
01:16:08,880 --> 01:16:09,530
God ..

799
01:16:10,843 --> 01:16:13,054
That was
so fucking stupid

800
01:16:13,265 --> 01:16:14,545
You keep talking
like that, all right?

801
01:16:14,734 --> 01:16:16,167
You make it easy, man

802
01:16:16,523 --> 01:16:19,010
Think about all the blow you're gonna
have to buy with that money

803
01:16:19,490 --> 01:16:21,265
Just to deal
with what happened to Dylan.

804
01:16:21,301 --> 01:16:22,778
Think about that, Frankie

805
01:16:22,821 --> 01:16:24,625
Don't say stuff like that, man

806
01:16:27,556 --> 01:16:29,032
Where are you gonna aim,
Frankie?

807
01:16:31,890 --> 01:16:32,967
Right between the eyes?

808
01:16:35,083 --> 01:16:36,603
Fuck you, man

809
01:16:43,905 --> 01:16:45,563
Get up .. get up.

810
01:17:19,185 --> 01:17:22,647
ok, ok, that's enough, Terry

811
01:17:22,690 --> 01:17:24,007
That's enough

812
01:17:26,669 --> 01:17:28,356
Hey, Captain, look.

813
01:17:28,400 --> 01:17:30,509
hey, man, it's over,
all right? It's over

814
01:17:30,520 --> 01:17:31,250
Not likely

815
01:17:36,341 --> 01:17:37,527
Captain

816
01:17:38,043 --> 01:17:39,461
Captain

817
01:18:11,272 --> 01:18:12,661
Hold it, Captain

818
01:18:24,705 --> 01:18:26,727
Son of a bitch
He's up the fire escape

819
01:18:26,770 --> 01:18:28,298
Take the stairs, Sam

820
01:19:21,854 --> 01:19:25,636
You didn't think I'd run off without
saying goodbye, did you Terry?

821
01:20:02,152 --> 01:20:03,541
You set me up

822
01:20:03,658 --> 01:20:06,407
You fucked with me
You fucked with Frankie

823
01:20:06,450 --> 01:20:08,370
Frankie came to me
with the money

824
01:20:19,512 --> 01:20:21,767
Who the fuck do you think
you're dealing with?

825
01:21:11,010 --> 01:21:12,058
You sleep?

826
01:21:12,232 --> 01:21:13,701
of course, he's asleep.

827
01:21:16,240 --> 01:21:17,658
Hey, you asleep?

828
01:21:21,360 --> 01:21:22,989
I'm not sleep

829
01:21:23,672 --> 01:21:24,829
anymore

830
01:21:25,716 --> 01:21:27,061
I knew it

831
01:21:27,709 --> 01:21:30,378
Hey, look who wanted
to come see you

832
01:21:32,720 --> 01:21:34,101
Hey, there.

833
01:21:34,974 --> 01:21:35,927
You missed me?

834
01:21:36,087 --> 01:21:37,440
She sure did

835
01:21:39,185 --> 01:21:40,480
Is it broken?

836
01:21:40,821 --> 01:21:41,723
Yeah

837
01:21:42,058 --> 01:21:42,821
Good

838
01:21:44,087 --> 01:21:45,010
What do you mean, good?

839
01:21:45,047 --> 01:21:46,880
I thought you wanted me
to play music for a living

840
01:21:47,330 --> 01:21:49,832
Your left hand sucks.
It could use the practice.

841
01:21:49,869 --> 01:21:50,901
oh, yeah?

842
01:21:51,214 --> 01:21:52,240
Thanks a lot

843
01:21:53,294 --> 01:21:55,200
What happened
to the $3 Million?

844
01:21:56,203 --> 01:21:58,000
They didn't say anything
about it in the paper.
