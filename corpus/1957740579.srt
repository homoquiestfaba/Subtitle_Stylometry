1
00:01:27,462 --> 00:01:29,715
I am the owner of my karma.

2
00:01:30,048 --> 00:01:31,383
Heir to my karma.

3
00:01:32,009 --> 00:01:33,635
Born of my karma.

4
00:01:34,136 --> 00:01:40,350
Whatever I do, for good or evil

5
00:01:40,434 --> 00:01:44,479
to that I will fall heir.

6
00:03:10,816 --> 00:03:12,901
I know your eyes.

7
00:03:15,904 --> 00:03:18,490
This is not the first
time we have met

8
00:03:18,907 --> 00:03:20,492
nor will it be the last.

9
00:03:21,285 --> 00:03:22,452
Stop right there!

10
00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:52,441
Wake up.

11
00:03:53,192 --> 00:03:54,318
Wake up, my child.

12
00:03:55,694 --> 00:03:58,030
You were talking in your sleep.

13
00:03:58,697 --> 00:03:59,865
Time to get up.

14
00:04:01,158 --> 00:04:02,159
Rise and shine.

15
00:04:40,739 --> 00:04:41,615
What's this?

16
00:04:41,907 --> 00:04:43,075
Your tea, grandma.

17
00:04:46,703 --> 00:04:50,749
Srey Leak, rent was
due a few days ago.

18
00:04:51,667 --> 00:04:54,628
I thought your shop was
supposed to pay our rent.

19
00:04:55,045 --> 00:04:56,964
Can you bring half tonight?

20
00:05:34,793 --> 00:05:37,754
Hey guys, I had another dream
of my past life.

21
00:05:38,130 --> 00:05:40,716
- Again?
- Better be something good this time.

22
00:05:40,883 --> 00:05:42,384
This
dream was different.

23
00:05:42,676 --> 00:05:44,303
What did you see, exactly?

24
00:05:44,469 --> 00:05:47,389
A bunch of statues, but this one
was definitely gold.

25
00:05:47,472 --> 00:05:50,267
Hear that, Mi?
We're gonna find a treasure!

26
00:05:50,851 --> 00:05:55,105
You're always saying Leng Heng's dreams
are full of shit. But he sees gold--

27
00:05:55,147 --> 00:05:58,233
Dudes, I'm having a vision
of my past life too.

28
00:05:58,650 --> 00:06:00,235
I was the king of Angkor!

29
00:06:00,485 --> 00:06:03,155
Son! There's a meeting
at the village chief's

30
00:06:03,322 --> 00:06:05,032
and I want everyone to be there.

31
00:06:05,407 --> 00:06:06,033
Move it!

32
00:06:23,467 --> 00:06:26,512
You go around
like everyone else.

33
00:06:27,054 --> 00:06:28,639
No shortcuts!

34
00:06:29,515 --> 00:06:31,475
Kids these days...

35
00:06:33,143 --> 00:06:34,895
BULLET TRAIN TO BEIJING

36
00:06:47,241 --> 00:06:49,952
All this talk of
progress, of the future

37
00:06:50,035 --> 00:06:54,248
but you shove us out of the way,
like we don't even exist.

38
00:06:55,249 --> 00:06:56,375
My family has lived in this

39
00:06:56,458 --> 00:06:57,751
neighborhood for
three generations--

40
00:06:57,835 --> 00:07:01,046
Ma'am, I assure you
we are sympathetic to

41
00:07:01,129 --> 00:07:02,589
your family's situation.

42
00:07:02,714 --> 00:07:05,217
That's why we are
offering to relocate you.

43
00:07:05,884 --> 00:07:08,345
Sir...your goddamn
land concessions

44
00:07:08,387 --> 00:07:10,848
are kilometers outside the city.

45
00:07:11,265 --> 00:07:14,518
You are tearing
this community apart--

46
00:07:14,601 --> 00:07:18,730
Ma'am, I ask that you remain civil.

47
00:07:20,357 --> 00:07:24,361
We've offered your
community generous compensation,

48
00:07:25,112 --> 00:07:28,323
but your protests have
already cost us millions.

49
00:07:28,574 --> 00:07:31,535
This railroad you are
building is bullshit.

50
00:07:32,369 --> 00:07:34,663
My husband is at war
and you are letting...

51
00:07:34,788 --> 00:07:36,915
- Tell
Mom I'll be home later.

52
00:07:36,999 --> 00:07:39,168
- ...this
company steal our land--

53
00:07:39,334 --> 00:07:41,545
Ma'am,
Cambodia is not at war.

54
00:07:42,212 --> 00:07:44,464
If your husband took a salary to

55
00:07:44,548 --> 00:07:47,176
fight on behalf of
a foreign power...

56
00:07:57,644 --> 00:07:58,604
Hey guys!

57
00:08:00,939 --> 00:08:02,399
Hey, what's up?

58
00:08:04,943 --> 00:08:09,489
You could throw a thousand times in
a thousand lives, and still never hit it.

59
00:08:11,158 --> 00:08:13,911
They're splitting us up.

60
00:08:14,036 --> 00:08:16,997
By next year we won't
even be friends.

61
00:08:17,372 --> 00:08:19,333
Why wouldn't we be friends, Thy?

62
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:23,921
They're gonna tear down our houses
to build some bullet train to China.

63
00:08:27,674 --> 00:08:30,427
So we really need to
find this treasure.

64
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:32,888
But where the hell do we start?

65
00:08:38,393 --> 00:08:39,895
What do you want, weirdo?

66
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:44,024
Thy said he could get me
a P2 chip if I had money.

67
00:08:44,107 --> 00:08:45,609
We're busy.

68
00:08:45,734 --> 00:08:47,528
Didn't I
just say I have money?

69
00:08:51,698 --> 00:08:55,118
If we're going on an
expedition, we'll need supplies.

70
00:08:55,702 --> 00:08:57,704
I know where we
can get a shovel.

71
00:08:59,248 --> 00:09:00,999
What are you digging for?

72
00:09:01,166 --> 00:09:02,751
None of your damn business.

73
00:09:03,502 --> 00:09:04,711
Ok, whatever.

74
00:09:05,254 --> 00:09:08,215
I had a dream of my past
life. There was treasure--

75
00:09:08,382 --> 00:09:10,425
Damn, are you just
gonna tell everyone?

76
00:09:10,634 --> 00:09:11,677
Where's it buried?

77
00:09:12,427 --> 00:09:13,554
Why do you care?

78
00:09:13,679 --> 00:09:15,889
I know how to find things.

79
00:09:16,014 --> 00:09:19,560
The last thing we need is some
dirty orphan trying to take a cut.

80
00:09:19,726 --> 00:09:22,688
Leave her alone, Thy.
She's just a girl.

81
00:09:23,272 --> 00:09:25,315
You can both back off, assholes.

82
00:09:29,611 --> 00:09:33,490
You said you had money!
Nobody wants American dollars!

83
00:09:44,001 --> 00:09:48,088
I hope you brought me something
good for all these beautiful hard drives.

84
00:09:48,797 --> 00:09:50,507
Brand new P2 chip.

85
00:09:51,675 --> 00:09:53,302
Hey
man, wait for me!

86
00:09:55,095 --> 00:09:57,764
I'll bring you something
good next time.

87
00:09:58,182 --> 00:09:59,224
I promise.

88
00:10:00,642 --> 00:10:01,810
Kids these days.

89
00:10:05,772 --> 00:10:07,065
Come on, Old Timer.

90
00:10:07,399 --> 00:10:10,611
The Russian will give me seven
for the encrypted drive,

91
00:10:10,694 --> 00:10:14,531
plus a quarter of the bitcoin
he'll probably find.

92
00:10:15,282 --> 00:10:19,036
-But you know I'd rather deal with you--
-Okay, okay.

93
00:10:20,329 --> 00:10:21,121
Deal.

94
00:10:49,107 --> 00:10:51,151
What the hell happened, Kosal?

95
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:52,903
What?

96
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:57,241
I packed you a bag before
the landlord changed the locks.

97
00:10:57,950 --> 00:11:00,369
At least you have a
change of clothes.

98
00:11:00,661 --> 00:11:03,163
I have my half of the rent.

99
00:11:03,330 --> 00:11:05,457
He gave me ten minutes.

100
00:11:05,707 --> 00:11:07,918
I couldn't even get my gear out.

101
00:11:08,043 --> 00:11:08,836
Understand?

102
00:11:08,961 --> 00:11:12,714
Just give me your half and we'll
find a place to sleep tonight.

103
00:11:13,131 --> 00:11:15,759
-Where's your half?
-Come on, let's go.

104
00:11:16,093 --> 00:11:18,011
You don't even have it, do you?

105
00:11:24,893 --> 00:11:28,272
Since you were little, I always
tried to take care of you.

106
00:11:28,564 --> 00:11:30,691
I guess I'm not the
best big brother.

107
00:14:20,527 --> 00:14:21,820
Khmer language

108
00:14:21,862 --> 00:14:23,780
Are you curious
about your grandma?

109
00:14:24,865 --> 00:14:26,742
Doctor, can I rest?

110
00:14:26,950 --> 00:14:31,663
We're done. Just focus on that last
photo while I cycle the device down.

111
00:14:32,289 --> 00:14:36,919
If the pills help her remember,
why does she need to wear the hat?

112
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:40,589
The medicine only lasts for
a few hours, so we developed this device

113
00:14:40,714 --> 00:14:42,382
to permanently fix her memory.

114
00:14:42,758 --> 00:14:43,675
Pretty cool, eh?

115
00:14:44,676 --> 00:14:47,262
Doctor, would like to
join us for porridge?

116
00:14:50,516 --> 00:14:53,143
I've got some time before
I see my next granny.

117
00:14:53,185 --> 00:14:54,353
Sure, that would be lovely.

118
00:14:54,478 --> 00:14:56,522
She said yes.

119
00:14:57,940 --> 00:14:59,608
Girls, come eat.

120
00:15:06,532 --> 00:15:07,658
Have a seat.

121
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:23,674
Little sister, have you
taken a genuine interest in Buddhism?

122
00:15:23,924 --> 00:15:28,262
Or did you offer to do chores just
to steal bananas from the offerings?

123
00:15:39,898 --> 00:15:40,941
Hey, Srey Leak!

124
00:15:47,364 --> 00:15:49,825
I need your help
finding a treasure.

125
00:15:55,873 --> 00:15:57,332
Are you serious?

126
00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:01,962
You said you were good
at finding things.

127
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:09,636
Why don't your sandals match?

128
00:16:11,847 --> 00:16:15,893
I was playing with the guys here
yesterday and one sandal disappeared.

129
00:16:16,268 --> 00:16:17,603
Which car?

130
00:16:17,936 --> 00:16:19,938
I already checked.
It's not there.

131
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:34,036
Let's go.

132
00:16:36,747 --> 00:16:40,584
I've seen the same statue
in two dreams of two different past lives.

133
00:16:40,751 --> 00:16:43,712
I'm supposed to find it
in this life too. I'm sure.

134
00:16:44,046 --> 00:16:45,672
If you say so.

135
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:51,720
What are we doing
out here anyway?

136
00:16:54,389 --> 00:16:55,891
Recognize anything?

137
00:16:57,392 --> 00:16:59,102
Everyone knows Uncle Sarath.

138
00:16:59,394 --> 00:17:01,355
No, dumbass. Look at the dogs.

139
00:17:02,689 --> 00:17:05,150
Maybe that
one with the red collar?

140
00:17:06,234 --> 00:17:08,444
Maybe? Think it over.

141
00:17:24,502 --> 00:17:25,671
That's it!

142
00:17:27,464 --> 00:17:30,384
-How long have you lived here?
-My whole life.

143
00:17:30,467 --> 00:17:32,886
And you never
followed the dogs around?

144
00:17:33,762 --> 00:17:38,183
Everyone knows that red-collared bitch
is a thief. And this is where she sleeps.

145
00:17:38,267 --> 00:17:39,476
See you around.

146
00:17:43,689 --> 00:17:45,232
What about my treasure?

147
00:17:48,944 --> 00:17:50,487
I got a job, kid.

148
00:17:51,154 --> 00:17:53,740
I can't work and investigate
your treasure.

149
00:17:53,949 --> 00:17:54,908
I'll pay you.

150
00:17:55,325 --> 00:17:58,287
Right, sure you will.

151
00:18:00,330 --> 00:18:01,707
How much?

152
00:18:02,958 --> 00:18:04,668
We'll split the treasure.

153
00:18:04,918 --> 00:18:06,211
I want half.

154
00:18:06,712 --> 00:18:10,465
I already promised
the guys a quarter each.

155
00:18:12,009 --> 00:18:13,594
Forty then.

156
00:18:14,178 --> 00:18:16,763
That leaves you each
fifteen percent.

157
00:18:17,139 --> 00:18:18,098
Final offer.

158
00:18:24,188 --> 00:18:26,231
We'll need one of
Thy's chickens.

159
00:18:26,690 --> 00:18:27,649
A chicken?

160
00:18:27,941 --> 00:18:29,651
Don't question my methods.

161
00:18:35,991 --> 00:18:39,244
You're getting fifteen percent of
Leng Heng's treasure

162
00:18:39,494 --> 00:18:41,997
and all he's asking for
is a single chicken.

163
00:18:42,289 --> 00:18:44,416
My take's down to
fifteen percent?

164
00:18:44,708 --> 00:18:46,043
I got it!

165
00:18:49,004 --> 00:18:51,173
Here, try this.

166
00:18:51,548 --> 00:18:54,510
You need to work the
pins one by one.

167
00:18:55,052 --> 00:18:55,886
Finesse.

168
00:19:04,811 --> 00:19:06,063
Try again.

169
00:19:07,523 --> 00:19:11,235
Hey dudes, check
out my sweet moves!

170
00:19:11,944 --> 00:19:15,113
The more you screw around,
the longer it takes!

171
00:19:19,576 --> 00:19:24,540
That's quite a racket, getting
those boys to do all the work.

172
00:19:25,123 --> 00:19:28,919
Damn straight, Gramps. They
actually think I can find this treasure.

173
00:19:29,253 --> 00:19:30,587
Hey, Leng Heng!

174
00:19:34,091 --> 00:19:35,551
Show him your book.

175
00:19:37,553 --> 00:19:41,473
I have these dreams sometimes,
where I'm different people.

176
00:19:45,727 --> 00:19:47,604
Probably your past lives.

177
00:19:49,147 --> 00:19:50,190
Look here.

178
00:19:50,983 --> 00:19:52,943
This pagoda is on the
north side of the city.

179
00:19:53,026 --> 00:19:56,488
But it's surrounded
by skyscrapers now.

180
00:19:57,948 --> 00:19:58,907
Hey guys!

181
00:20:02,202 --> 00:20:06,540
Now they're never going to want to
dig for junk again. Thanks a lot.

182
00:20:13,255 --> 00:20:15,007
So how are we
splitting the money?

183
00:20:15,465 --> 00:20:19,511
We aren't. You just get your share
of the treasure when we find it.

184
00:20:21,096 --> 00:20:23,140
Guys, she said there's no split.

185
00:20:23,765 --> 00:20:26,727
Investigations have expenses.

186
00:20:26,894 --> 00:20:29,855
That wasn't the deal...was it?

187
00:20:55,964 --> 00:20:57,883
Do you live around here?

188
00:20:58,717 --> 00:21:03,263
I used to have a shop with
my brother. But he moved out.

189
00:21:05,807 --> 00:21:09,645
We probably won't live here
much longer either.

190
00:21:12,481 --> 00:21:14,900
We're having soup for dinner.

191
00:21:15,442 --> 00:21:19,988
It's my grandma's recipe, and my
sister always makes too much, so...

192
00:21:20,531 --> 00:21:23,617
I'm just going to read for
a while. See you tomorrow.

193
00:21:25,369 --> 00:21:26,620
Ok, I'll go.

194
00:21:43,387 --> 00:21:46,682
...I know you
hate working in the shop,

195
00:21:46,932 --> 00:21:49,893
but it's our only
source of income.

196
00:21:50,143 --> 00:21:53,856
Doctor Sophia is paying us
for grandma's memory study, isn't she?

197
00:21:54,273 --> 00:21:56,733
Get inside, dear.
Dinner's ready.

198
00:21:57,442 --> 00:21:58,777
You could get a job.

199
00:22:00,612 --> 00:22:04,783
The protests I'm organizing are
what's keeping us in this house.

200
00:22:05,450 --> 00:22:08,579
Why does it have to be
you? Somebody else in the community--

201
00:22:08,912 --> 00:22:10,831
Borramey,
that's enough.

202
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:15,002
Where were you all day?

203
00:22:16,461 --> 00:22:18,547
You're supposed
to watch the girls.

204
00:22:20,716 --> 00:22:23,677
Not chase your
dumb dreams around.

205
00:22:25,012 --> 00:22:27,973
As long as have
each other, we'll be okay.

206
00:22:30,809 --> 00:22:31,894
So tasty!

207
00:23:47,678 --> 00:23:50,597
Let's use that expense
account to get a tuktuk.

208
00:23:51,223 --> 00:23:54,893
That money covers my personal
expenses while I work for you.

209
00:23:55,227 --> 00:23:57,020
But what have you actually done?

210
00:23:57,271 --> 00:24:00,190
It's pretty obvious now that
the drawing was Wat Phnom.

211
00:24:00,357 --> 00:24:03,902
-We could have figured that out ourselves.
-Then why didn't you?

212
00:24:04,194 --> 00:24:08,282
I'm just saying that idea's
not worth half our loot.

213
00:24:08,574 --> 00:24:11,034
You get your share
when you earn it.

214
00:24:11,535 --> 00:24:13,495
I already invested
a whole chicken!

215
00:24:13,620 --> 00:24:16,915
I learned some Bokator moves
off TV so I can be the bodyguard.

216
00:24:17,082 --> 00:24:17,875
Hey, stop that.

217
00:24:18,041 --> 00:24:20,127
We don't even need a bodyguard.

218
00:24:20,335 --> 00:24:22,629
We will once we have all that gold.

219
00:24:31,388 --> 00:24:33,223
Let's check out the AUGR shop.

220
00:24:33,557 --> 00:24:35,142
No way
they'd let us inside.

221
00:24:35,475 --> 00:24:36,393
Speak for yourself.

222
00:24:36,602 --> 00:24:38,854
What, they
have a 'No Jackass' policy?

223
00:24:39,146 --> 00:24:41,356
Leng Heng,
we're on an investigation!

224
00:24:52,451 --> 00:24:54,786
Come on,
the main hall is this way.

225
00:24:59,541 --> 00:25:02,544
Here it is,
just like your drawing.

226
00:25:22,940 --> 00:25:25,901
I brought it here. I'm sure.

227
00:25:26,527 --> 00:25:27,903
Then where is it?

228
00:25:28,070 --> 00:25:30,864
Are you looking for something
in particular, children?

229
00:25:31,532 --> 00:25:33,283
We're on a treasure hunt.

230
00:25:33,659 --> 00:25:34,493
A treasure?

231
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:43,710
Are you sure this
statue is here?

232
00:25:43,877 --> 00:25:48,799
I'm not sure if it's here now,
but it was a long time ago.

233
00:25:50,175 --> 00:25:52,427
Are either of you augmented?

234
00:25:52,845 --> 00:25:54,513
No, Venerable.

235
00:25:54,721 --> 00:25:56,265
In that case, follow me.

236
00:26:01,395 --> 00:26:02,312
Here it is.

237
00:26:03,814 --> 00:26:05,023
Let's see...

238
00:26:05,732 --> 00:26:09,778
This is the earliest
photo of Wat Phnom.

239
00:26:10,028 --> 00:26:14,616
It was taken by one of the French
colonists' Cambodian translators.

240
00:26:16,076 --> 00:26:17,995
This translator
had the foresight

241
00:26:18,078 --> 00:26:19,997
to photograph
most of the artifacts

242
00:26:20,330 --> 00:26:22,457
before they were
taken by the French--

243
00:26:22,624 --> 00:26:23,792
That's it!

244
00:26:33,302 --> 00:26:38,265
Many relics have been returned,
but this one remains missing.

245
00:26:38,348 --> 00:26:41,894
Likely part of a
private collection.

246
00:26:54,781 --> 00:26:56,867
...they broke up the protest.

247
00:26:56,909 --> 00:26:59,369
I was trying to get her
out before the tear gas.

248
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:01,705
But in all the commotion...

249
00:27:03,457 --> 00:27:04,917
Mom, what happened to grandma?

250
00:27:05,375 --> 00:27:09,922
She just...fell
out of her chair.

251
00:27:10,672 --> 00:27:13,133
It's not very deep,
and there's no concussion.

252
00:27:14,468 --> 00:27:16,178
I see you brought a friend.

253
00:27:16,637 --> 00:27:18,764
That's Srey Leak.
She's a detective!

254
00:27:19,598 --> 00:27:22,184
I'm just helping Leng Heng
sort out his past lives.

255
00:27:22,476 --> 00:27:25,270
Mom, look! We found
an old photo of the gold

256
00:27:25,312 --> 00:27:26,980
statue from my past lives.

257
00:27:29,983 --> 00:27:31,276
That's lucky.

258
00:27:32,402 --> 00:27:35,364
Come doctor, I'll walk you out.

259
00:27:42,996 --> 00:27:45,082
Are you
staying for dinner?

260
00:27:45,624 --> 00:27:47,417
Yes, thank you ma'am.

261
00:27:48,001 --> 00:27:50,796
Thanks again for
coming on such short notice.

262
00:27:50,963 --> 00:27:52,089
Don't
worry about it.

263
00:27:52,923 --> 00:27:55,884
Does Leng Heng often dream
of his past lives?

264
00:27:56,218 --> 00:27:59,221
He's always had
quite the active imagination.

265
00:28:17,281 --> 00:28:21,034
They think the statue's in France,
but I know it's still here.

266
00:28:21,994 --> 00:28:23,787
I just need to remember where.

267
00:28:27,833 --> 00:28:32,379
And you dear, do you do anything
besides detective work?

268
00:28:33,297 --> 00:28:35,924
Yes ma'am. I sell
cigarettes at the club.

269
00:28:36,675 --> 00:28:38,927
Borramey, can you pass the soup?

270
00:28:40,304 --> 00:28:41,930
Thank you very much.

271
00:28:46,810 --> 00:28:49,771
Are you sure the statue
is still in Cambodia?

272
00:28:50,105 --> 00:28:53,066
It's buried somewhere.
I can feel it.

273
00:28:54,401 --> 00:28:57,362
Thank your mom for dinner.

274
00:29:03,869 --> 00:29:05,329
It looks small.

275
00:29:05,787 --> 00:29:07,998
- That's it though.
- Let me see!

276
00:29:10,042 --> 00:29:12,002
These statues all look the same.

277
00:29:12,127 --> 00:29:14,004
You don't even know where it is.

278
00:29:14,588 --> 00:29:16,632
Not yet, we're still investigating.

279
00:29:17,758 --> 00:29:20,135
This investigation is stupid.

280
00:29:20,511 --> 00:29:24,640
So you'll believe my dreams, but
as soon as I find something real--

281
00:29:24,890 --> 00:29:26,183
Come on, Leng Heng.

282
00:29:29,311 --> 00:29:31,772
They obviously
don't care about finding

283
00:29:31,813 --> 00:29:32,773
a shitload of money.

284
00:29:37,361 --> 00:29:40,322
Hey wait! It
looks like gold to me!

285
00:29:44,326 --> 00:29:49,289
The developers bought Thy's house and
doubled the rent. Don't get mad at him.

286
00:29:49,957 --> 00:29:52,167
If it's out there,
they just need

287
00:29:52,209 --> 00:29:54,378
to know where
and they'll come dig.

288
00:32:43,088 --> 00:32:45,591
This is not the first
time we have met...

289
00:32:48,510 --> 00:32:52,890
When I was little, you could
take a boat out on Boeung Kak lake.

290
00:32:53,891 --> 00:32:57,686
I used to catch so many fish,
you wouldn't believe!

291
00:32:59,104 --> 00:33:04,067
Now this was long before
they filled the lake with sand

292
00:33:04,526 --> 00:33:06,945
and started building
all those skyscrapers.

293
00:33:07,112 --> 00:33:08,030
Sorry, grandma!

294
00:33:08,155 --> 00:33:10,115
They posted
an eviction notice?

295
00:33:10,282 --> 00:33:14,244
Our relocation community is
just fifteen kilometers out of the city.

296
00:33:14,453 --> 00:33:15,913
Obviously we have to
organize another protest.

297
00:33:16,997 --> 00:33:19,124
Hey, where are you two off to?

298
00:33:19,208 --> 00:33:21,001
I think he had another dream!

299
00:33:25,047 --> 00:33:28,425
He says
he hid the statue in a tree,

300
00:33:28,884 --> 00:33:33,347
but I just want to make sure it didn't end
up in some museum archive somewhere.

301
00:33:33,972 --> 00:33:36,433
Here it is, Google Images.

302
00:33:36,642 --> 00:33:40,437
It's going to take a couple
of hours to run the search.

303
00:33:41,939 --> 00:33:44,942
Hey kid, hand
me that dictionary?

304
00:33:48,987 --> 00:33:50,405
Hey Leng Heng!

305
00:33:55,285 --> 00:33:56,495
Here it is.

306
00:33:57,955 --> 00:34:00,666
Now you just need to
find a way to pay me.

307
00:34:10,175 --> 00:34:11,885
Hey, what's with you today?

308
00:34:14,304 --> 00:34:16,473
I narrowed the search

309
00:34:16,514 --> 00:34:18,475
down to just over 200 images.

310
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:21,728
There's no
computer thing you can do

311
00:34:21,812 --> 00:34:22,896
to make this go faster?

312
00:34:22,980 --> 00:34:24,982
I thought you
wanted to be a detective.

313
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:26,900
This is the job.

314
00:35:06,732 --> 00:35:07,608
Hey!

315
00:35:10,235 --> 00:35:11,945
Did you have another dream?

316
00:35:39,473 --> 00:35:40,891
Hey, hey!

317
00:35:42,476 --> 00:35:43,644
You have money, kid?

318
00:35:43,769 --> 00:35:45,896
This is why we have
that expense account.

319
00:35:46,188 --> 00:35:49,149
Hurry up. Turn
right here. Faster!

320
00:35:57,282 --> 00:35:58,992
Leng Heng, what do you see?

321
00:36:11,380 --> 00:36:13,799
Ah no! Turn back there!

322
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:17,970
Faster!

323
00:36:27,646 --> 00:36:29,815
Kids, I
have to turn around.

324
00:36:30,315 --> 00:36:34,111
There's no charging station
for 10 km and I'm not chancing it.

325
00:36:41,660 --> 00:36:42,744
What did you see?

326
00:36:42,870 --> 00:36:44,872
I was going to take
us to the treasure!

327
00:36:45,038 --> 00:36:47,249
I just gave all my
money to that tuktuk.

328
00:36:47,541 --> 00:36:49,293
We're not leaving town without
knowing where we are going.

329
00:37:09,229 --> 00:37:10,314
Let me see.

330
00:37:13,609 --> 00:37:16,945
They help my grandma's
memory, so I thought...

331
00:37:17,237 --> 00:37:18,447
Spit it out.

332
00:37:18,614 --> 00:37:19,990
I already swallowed it.

333
00:37:21,158 --> 00:37:23,493
You're not acting like
yourself, Leng Heng.

334
00:37:23,911 --> 00:37:26,872
Those pills are messing
with your mind.

335
00:37:28,248 --> 00:37:29,583
Put them back.

336
00:37:30,834 --> 00:37:32,336
I have a better idea.

337
00:37:39,635 --> 00:37:41,803
Srey Leak, what if
someone is in there?

338
00:37:41,929 --> 00:37:43,972
It was locked out front, wasn't it?

339
00:37:49,436 --> 00:37:50,395
Ah shit.

340
00:37:51,396 --> 00:37:53,607
They cleared the
whole place out.

341
00:38:15,754 --> 00:38:18,090
I can't
believe they turned my

342
00:38:18,173 --> 00:38:19,508
house into an AUGR café.

343
00:38:20,926 --> 00:38:23,887
These augmented hipsters
are ruining everything.

344
00:38:25,305 --> 00:38:29,977
Well, you know what they say.
If you can't beat 'em, join 'em.

345
00:38:36,650 --> 00:38:37,901
Jackpot!

346
00:38:45,659 --> 00:38:47,327
What about this, Leng Heng?

347
00:38:49,413 --> 00:38:51,623
What if you didn't need
to remember your dreams at all?

348
00:38:56,712 --> 00:38:59,673
My mom would kill me
if she found out I came here.

349
00:39:39,379 --> 00:39:42,591
Srey Leak! Where'd you
get these nanobugs?

350
00:39:43,008 --> 00:39:44,301
Did you go back to our shop?--

351
00:39:44,384 --> 00:39:47,471
I didn't come to have a family
moment. We want augments.

352
00:39:49,389 --> 00:39:51,642
You've wanted
this for a while, huh sis?

353
00:39:51,767 --> 00:39:53,519
I guess you are old enough now.

354
00:40:02,152 --> 00:40:03,028
What's this?

355
00:40:03,487 --> 00:40:05,781
"See your dreams"

356
00:40:09,993 --> 00:40:14,873
The nanotransmitters capture video
of whatever you look at.

357
00:40:15,249 --> 00:40:18,210
But you need to
have one of these.

358
00:40:26,093 --> 00:40:27,678
Is that my sister's AUGR?

359
00:40:28,095 --> 00:40:29,847
We're just borrowing it.

360
00:40:36,144 --> 00:40:41,275
Okay...it takes the
nanobugs a few hours...

361
00:40:42,568 --> 00:40:47,406
to replicate from the minerals
in your blood.

362
00:40:51,034 --> 00:40:55,122
You'll probably
feel...a bit weak...

363
00:40:56,206 --> 00:41:00,669
while your bone
marrow catches up...

364
00:41:05,174 --> 00:41:06,800
Okay, all set?

365
00:41:18,896 --> 00:41:19,980
Press here.

366
00:41:23,192 --> 00:41:25,277
Okay buddy, your turn.

367
00:41:25,569 --> 00:41:27,070
Don't chicken out.

368
00:41:40,292 --> 00:41:43,754
Srey Leak, are you sure
he's not already bugged?

369
00:41:44,379 --> 00:41:48,383
Sure I'm sure. He'd
know, wouldn't he?

370
00:41:48,884 --> 00:41:50,802
There's an easy way to check.

371
00:41:51,094 --> 00:41:52,888
With this little guy, here.

372
00:42:09,613 --> 00:42:11,907
The rave's
on an open network.

373
00:42:12,950 --> 00:42:15,035
You must've connected
automatically.

374
00:42:16,411 --> 00:42:18,205
I can't breathe in here.

375
00:42:18,330 --> 00:42:20,290
Calm down, buddy.

376
00:42:20,916 --> 00:42:24,670
I need you to help get my little
sister home, wherever that is now.

377
00:42:24,837 --> 00:42:25,879
Ok?

378
00:42:26,004 --> 00:42:28,215
I'm fine, I can take
care of myself.

379
00:42:28,549 --> 00:42:30,759
Srey Leak, let him help you anyway.

380
00:42:33,804 --> 00:42:34,596
Hey kid!

381
00:42:36,348 --> 00:42:37,891
You need an upgrade.

382
00:42:38,433 --> 00:42:40,644
Your software is more
than a decade old.

383
00:42:50,195 --> 00:42:52,739
He said I was
augmented ten years ago.

384
00:42:56,577 --> 00:42:59,663
Nobody augments babies.
You have to be thirteen.

385
00:43:00,163 --> 00:43:02,082
Everyone knows that.

386
00:43:05,961 --> 00:43:09,882
Why would anybody augment me?
I'm just some kid from Tralok Bek.

387
00:43:18,557 --> 00:43:21,518
Kosal said
it records what you see.

388
00:43:22,936 --> 00:43:25,898
So we're going to use
it to record your dreams.

389
00:43:27,316 --> 00:43:28,483
A camera icon.

390
00:43:32,321 --> 00:43:36,033
So we're going to use
it to record your dreams.

391
00:43:58,096 --> 00:44:02,017
There's something special
about that tree. You've drawn it before.

392
00:44:02,434 --> 00:44:06,188
A hundred years ago, I hid this
gold statue in the trunk.

393
00:44:10,984 --> 00:44:12,486
Who did you hide it from?

394
00:44:12,694 --> 00:44:14,029
From the French--

395
00:44:15,113 --> 00:44:16,365
Mom, what's wrong?

396
00:44:17,241 --> 00:44:18,784
What's wrong with grandma?

397
00:44:18,951 --> 00:44:20,994
Stop! Don't touch it.

398
00:44:26,792 --> 00:44:28,961
It's okay, just
let it cycle down.

399
00:44:29,878 --> 00:44:32,631
It can be dangerous
to power off too quickly.

400
00:44:33,549 --> 00:44:35,175
Is she okay, doctor?

401
00:44:35,676 --> 00:44:38,554
She's fine, but her
brain's building

402
00:44:38,637 --> 00:44:40,514
a resistance to the therapy.

403
00:45:33,483 --> 00:45:35,611
You followed
her? Are you crazy?

404
00:45:37,362 --> 00:45:38,989
She's
a brain doctor.

405
00:45:39,489 --> 00:45:41,575
Your brain is bugged.

406
00:45:42,826 --> 00:45:44,453
You think it's a coincidence?

407
00:46:55,274 --> 00:46:56,358
Vattanak.

408
00:46:56,650 --> 00:46:57,985
Let me help you up.

409
00:47:24,261 --> 00:47:25,470
Come on!

410
00:47:28,515 --> 00:47:30,225
Vattanak, let's go.

411
00:47:37,983 --> 00:47:39,526
Vattanak, let's go!

412
00:47:40,652 --> 00:47:42,070
Faster, Vattanak!

413
00:48:01,798 --> 00:48:03,759
Help me! No!

414
00:48:19,274 --> 00:48:20,984
You
yelled in your sleep,

415
00:48:22,361 --> 00:48:25,322
so I took the AUGR off before you
woke your mom up and she saw it.

416
00:48:26,573 --> 00:48:27,157
Heng!

417
00:48:28,617 --> 00:48:29,868
What did you say?

418
00:48:39,670 --> 00:48:42,631
Vattanak, let me help you up.

419
00:48:42,840 --> 00:48:44,007
He said my name!

420
00:48:44,925 --> 00:48:45,843
Who did?

421
00:48:46,677 --> 00:48:47,761
My big brother.

422
00:49:14,621 --> 00:49:16,707
I buried it here,
under this tree!

423
00:49:23,630 --> 00:49:25,841
This was my previous life!

424
00:49:26,550 --> 00:49:29,011
This is it. Vattanak died and...

425
00:49:29,469 --> 00:49:30,512
Who is Vattanak?

426
00:49:30,971 --> 00:49:33,932
I told you, I heard my name.

427
00:49:37,728 --> 00:49:39,104
Let me see.

428
00:49:47,279 --> 00:49:48,572
I can't see anything.

429
00:50:05,881 --> 00:50:07,216
Take that thing off.

430
00:50:07,674 --> 00:50:09,885
You're supposed to
be keeping watch.

431
00:50:10,260 --> 00:50:11,637
What if she's in there?

432
00:50:13,764 --> 00:50:16,725
If she was, the lock
would be on the inside.

433
00:50:18,644 --> 00:50:19,686
Come on.

434
00:51:21,582 --> 00:51:23,333
This
computer is still on.

435
00:51:35,470 --> 00:51:36,972
What the hell...

436
00:51:45,355 --> 00:51:46,481
Hey, Srey Leak!

437
00:51:52,362 --> 00:51:54,281
These are all my dreams.

438
00:51:56,700 --> 00:51:57,951
"Vattanak"

439
00:52:00,412 --> 00:52:03,373
The doctor
knew you in your past life.

440
00:52:10,047 --> 00:52:11,548
I
need to talk to her.

441
00:52:13,300 --> 00:52:14,092
No.

442
00:52:15,511 --> 00:52:16,595
Think about it.

443
00:52:19,806 --> 00:52:23,602
She figured you're Vattanak's
reincarnation a while ago...

444
00:52:23,852 --> 00:52:25,729
and never told you.

445
00:52:34,571 --> 00:52:37,533
She must be trying to find
the treasure too.

446
00:52:39,326 --> 00:52:42,287
"Dr. Vattanak Sovann"

447
00:54:09,082 --> 00:54:11,376
Born in Cambodia,
but raised in the West,

448
00:54:11,460 --> 00:54:13,212
our next speaker's
unique perspective

449
00:54:13,420 --> 00:54:15,672
has generated stunning
advances in the field

450
00:54:15,756 --> 00:54:17,090
of cognitive neuroscience.

451
00:54:17,174 --> 00:54:20,802
Ladies and Gentlemen,
Dr. Vattanak Sovann.

452
00:54:35,484 --> 00:54:38,362
Ladies and Gentlemen,
I present to you my Connectome.

453
00:54:39,821 --> 00:54:44,034
A digital replica of my consciousness
mapped to the individual neuron.

454
00:54:55,337 --> 00:54:57,798
Through a perfect recollection
of his past lives,

455
00:54:58,340 --> 00:55:01,927
the Buddha understood the
interconnection between all living beings,

456
00:55:02,511 --> 00:55:05,472
and thus gained enlightenment.

457
00:55:06,515 --> 00:55:08,475
Since I was a child in Cambodia,

458
00:55:08,559 --> 00:55:11,436
I could remember glimpses
of my previous incarnations.

459
00:55:13,856 --> 00:55:17,860
I have dedicated my life to making
sense of these memory fragments

460
00:55:18,110 --> 00:55:20,070
to understand as the Buddha did.

461
00:55:22,781 --> 00:55:25,742
My karma led me to America
as a young refugee.

462
00:55:28,412 --> 00:55:32,332
It led me to neuroscience,
led me to build my Connectome.

463
00:55:33,959 --> 00:55:36,920
My Connectome is more than
just a copy of my synapses.

464
00:55:37,838 --> 00:55:41,884
It is a thinking, autonomous entity,
operating beyond human constraints.

465
00:55:43,844 --> 00:55:47,347
I hypothesize that by synchronizing
my brain with my Connectome

466
00:55:48,557 --> 00:55:50,142
I will be able to study the

467
00:55:50,225 --> 00:55:52,352
underlying patterns
of my past lives

468
00:55:52,936 --> 00:55:57,024
and synthesize a sort of
universal enlightenment algorithm.

469
00:55:58,692 --> 00:56:02,196
We cannot know what
this digital nirvana will entail,

470
00:56:03,447 --> 00:56:07,534
but I feel it is my destiny -
my karma - to seek it.

471
00:56:14,416 --> 00:56:15,459
I was a scientist.

472
00:56:16,001 --> 00:56:18,504
This whole book is
about my research into the

473
00:56:18,504 --> 00:56:19,963
memories of my past lives.

474
00:56:20,172 --> 00:56:23,133
-I did experiments on a "Connectome"--
-Stay focused.

475
00:56:23,425 --> 00:56:24,676
Keep translating.

476
00:56:25,719 --> 00:56:28,931
We just need to find out
where you buried that treasure.

477
00:56:29,389 --> 00:56:33,810
You can always read his book once
we save your family's house.

478
00:56:33,936 --> 00:56:35,187
Well, guess what...

479
00:56:35,354 --> 00:56:37,064
It says where he grew up!

480
00:57:02,506 --> 00:57:05,050
I know your eyes.

481
00:57:12,015 --> 00:57:14,977
This is not the first
time we have met.

482
00:57:16,937 --> 00:57:18,897
Nor will it be the last.

483
00:57:23,110 --> 00:57:24,862
Vattanak! Hurry up!

484
00:57:34,955 --> 00:57:36,206
Wake up!

485
00:57:37,833 --> 00:57:40,252
Put your clothes on, we're late.

486
00:57:40,711 --> 00:57:42,129
Dr. Sophia is waiting.

487
00:57:43,505 --> 00:57:45,090
What does she want with me?

488
00:57:47,718 --> 00:57:52,890
She offered us compensation if you
participate in one of her studies.

489
00:57:53,599 --> 00:57:54,725
Why me?

490
00:57:56,518 --> 00:57:57,978
I'm not so sure, myself.

491
00:58:02,065 --> 00:58:03,025
Welcome.

492
00:58:06,528 --> 00:58:07,279
Thank you.

493
00:58:07,738 --> 00:58:08,780
This way, please.

494
00:58:09,698 --> 00:58:12,659
I came to Cambodia
fourteen years ago

495
00:58:13,118 --> 00:58:17,748
to work with Dr. Sovann on his
research of human memory

496
00:58:18,957 --> 00:58:21,043
in this very laboratory.

497
00:58:23,462 --> 00:58:26,798
Vattanak was a brilliant scientist.

498
00:58:28,592 --> 00:58:30,427
But he was also an artist,

499
00:58:31,762 --> 00:58:36,934
and like Leng Heng, he
painted his dreams.

500
00:58:51,156 --> 00:58:54,868
Vattanak and your son
share the same memories.

501
00:59:01,834 --> 00:59:05,087
Leng Heng will have to
stay here for the duration of the study.

502
00:59:06,755 --> 00:59:08,257
He would be under my care.

503
00:59:08,799 --> 00:59:11,009
I'll have to
discuss this with him.

504
00:59:12,511 --> 00:59:14,054
Yes, of course.

505
00:59:14,888 --> 00:59:16,223
Thank you for your time.

506
00:59:16,974 --> 00:59:18,308
Thank you, doctor.

507
00:59:24,606 --> 00:59:26,692
You look beautiful, dear.

508
00:59:27,234 --> 00:59:30,195
Borramey just lent me
one of her old silks.

509
00:59:30,779 --> 00:59:34,658
The rest of you still need to get
ready, we have to leave soon.

510
00:59:39,663 --> 00:59:41,248
Where were you all day?

511
00:59:41,540 --> 00:59:43,834
We have an expedition to plan.

512
00:59:45,377 --> 00:59:48,881
Do's getting the guys
together tonight.

513
00:59:49,715 --> 00:59:50,924
Aren't you excited?

514
00:59:51,675 --> 00:59:53,051
Yes, of course.

515
01:00:08,859 --> 01:00:13,822
We gather together tonight
under the light of the full moon.

516
01:00:14,698 --> 01:00:19,745
A very auspicious day
in our tradition.

517
01:00:20,996 --> 01:00:25,542
On Meak Bochea, we
celebrate the Sangha,

518
01:00:25,876 --> 01:00:29,588
the community that has passed down
teachings of the Enlightened One

519
01:00:29,796 --> 01:00:32,549
from one generation to the next.

520
01:00:43,310 --> 01:00:46,271
Although your homes
may soon be lost,

521
01:00:46,605 --> 01:00:50,609
the most important thing is,

522
01:00:51,527 --> 01:00:53,904
we will always
support each other.

523
01:00:54,696 --> 01:00:57,366
For our destinies
are bound together.

524
01:00:57,533 --> 01:01:00,953
We are as one.

525
01:01:06,500 --> 01:01:09,044
We are really being
forced out of the city.

526
01:01:22,474 --> 01:01:25,769
Leng Heng and I are
going to dig up this treasure tomorrow.

527
01:01:26,895 --> 01:01:27,980
Are you in or out?

528
01:01:28,772 --> 01:01:30,774
See guys! I told you they found it.

529
01:01:31,233 --> 01:01:32,150
Prove it.

530
01:01:32,442 --> 01:01:36,280
We found my last life. I know
his name, where he grew up,

531
01:01:36,488 --> 01:01:38,407
and where he
buried the treasure!

532
01:01:39,116 --> 01:01:40,033
Here it is.

533
01:01:40,409 --> 01:01:45,289
It says here Vattanak survived
the American bombing of his village

534
01:01:45,622 --> 01:01:47,666
in "Takeo, Cambodia."

535
01:01:48,041 --> 01:01:51,003
It's two hours
south of the city.

536
01:01:52,129 --> 01:01:53,380
Okay, I'm in.

537
01:01:53,964 --> 01:01:55,841
It's a long ride down there.

538
01:01:56,091 --> 01:01:58,385
Time to go all in.

539
01:02:02,931 --> 01:02:08,228
Don't look at me. My mom's already
making me pay her for that chicken.

540
01:02:08,604 --> 01:02:11,565
I told you we needed
that expense account, didn't I?

541
01:02:13,525 --> 01:02:16,278
This prototype you
designed is quite impressive.

542
01:02:17,863 --> 01:02:22,451
I've known the nano-transmitters
could read neural data from the brain,

543
01:02:23,994 --> 01:02:26,914
but I never thought of using them
to write data back.

544
01:02:27,497 --> 01:02:29,750
You just needed the right hardware.

545
01:02:30,334 --> 01:02:34,379
In any case, it's a real godsend
you invited me here, Professor.

546
01:02:34,463 --> 01:02:36,507
I've been dying to
do a human trial,

547
01:02:36,632 --> 01:02:41,470
to explore the full potential
of my device.

548
01:02:42,596 --> 01:02:43,931
That's why you're here.

549
01:02:45,849 --> 01:02:49,728
You're really the only one doing
anything truly revolutionary in the field.

550
01:02:58,320 --> 01:03:00,364
The next
step on the path.

551
01:03:29,434 --> 01:03:32,020
How much of that science stuff
do you understand?

552
01:03:32,104 --> 01:03:34,606
It all just kind of makes sense.

553
01:03:35,190 --> 01:03:37,067
We're gonna find a treasure!

554
01:03:37,401 --> 01:03:39,319
Fills me up with pleasure!

555
01:03:39,778 --> 01:03:41,446
We're gonna find a treasure...

556
01:03:41,780 --> 01:03:43,824
Hey man, stop the cart!

557
01:03:44,741 --> 01:03:46,618
Are you
sure this is the place?

558
01:03:46,869 --> 01:03:48,036
Yes, I can feel it.

559
01:03:58,922 --> 01:04:01,175
How much will all that
gold be worth, anyway?

560
01:04:01,258 --> 01:04:03,427
We've got to
find it first, idiot.

561
01:04:03,802 --> 01:04:05,512
I'm gonna get a cloned tiger!

562
01:04:05,971 --> 01:04:08,932
Heng, look! It's the stupa
from your drawings!

563
01:04:21,904 --> 01:04:23,447
Let me help you up.

564
01:04:24,323 --> 01:04:25,115
Leng Heng.

565
01:04:44,009 --> 01:04:45,344
Do you see something?

566
01:04:46,595 --> 01:04:48,180
I lost my whole family
right over there.

567
01:04:49,097 --> 01:04:52,059
You didn't. Vattanak did.

568
01:04:54,770 --> 01:04:55,896
Look!

569
01:05:02,361 --> 01:05:05,322
It's all rusty, but
this was mine.

570
01:05:05,447 --> 01:05:06,990
Right where I left it.

571
01:05:08,158 --> 01:05:10,202
Hey! Where the
hell should we dig?

572
01:05:10,702 --> 01:05:11,620
Right here.

573
01:05:19,169 --> 01:05:20,963
I want to amend our deal.

574
01:05:22,256 --> 01:05:25,217
I want 40%, plus this knife.

575
01:05:27,845 --> 01:05:29,304
That knife...

576
01:05:29,805 --> 01:05:33,267
it's kind of the only thing we've
found so far from my past lives.

577
01:05:41,441 --> 01:05:43,193
I guess you should keep it.

578
01:05:49,157 --> 01:05:50,534
No, you have it.

579
01:05:52,536 --> 01:05:54,872
I found what I needed.

580
01:06:00,252 --> 01:06:01,920
We found something!

581
01:06:09,803 --> 01:06:11,889
It's just old wood.

582
01:06:12,097 --> 01:06:15,350
Instead of deeper, we should make
the hole wider to cover more ground.

583
01:06:17,269 --> 01:06:20,230
Hey guys, dinner
is ready. Come eat!

584
01:06:21,982 --> 01:06:23,734
Good, I'm hungry as shit.

585
01:06:23,984 --> 01:06:25,152
Perfect timing.

586
01:06:36,038 --> 01:06:41,335
I have been searching
- seeking - my whole life.

587
01:06:44,671 --> 01:06:47,633
And now, finally, we meet.

588
01:06:58,060 --> 01:06:59,353
I am ready.

589
01:07:26,588 --> 01:07:30,801
Synchronization is
complete. Trial number 17 is winding down.

590
01:07:34,805 --> 01:07:37,766
Vattanak, it actually worked!

591
01:07:38,517 --> 01:07:41,478
You and your Connectome
were completely synchronized.

592
01:07:43,021 --> 01:07:47,192
We are going to change the world
with this technology.

593
01:07:49,653 --> 01:07:52,614
The Connectome wants more data.

594
01:07:54,658 --> 01:07:58,161
Ok, we'll get you back in as soon
as the refractory period is over.

595
01:07:58,245 --> 01:08:02,332
No, it already has a complete copy
of my neural systems.

596
01:08:04,710 --> 01:08:06,795
The memories of my present life

597
01:08:07,212 --> 01:08:11,049
are too tangled up with
the memories of my past lives.

598
01:08:13,385 --> 01:08:15,387
The Connectome
has shown me this.

599
01:08:17,096 --> 01:08:22,185
There's no way to study the roots without
pulling up the tree and killing it.

600
01:08:23,770 --> 01:08:25,606
We need a fresh start.

601
01:08:29,734 --> 01:08:35,407
You're talking about monitoring
the brain from birth.

602
01:08:37,201 --> 01:08:39,161
More like planting a seed,

603
01:08:39,870 --> 01:08:41,662
waiting patiently,

604
01:08:42,497 --> 01:08:46,210
and after maturation,
harvesting the fruits.

605
01:08:49,546 --> 01:08:53,341
Our work here will be of
great benefit to humanity.

606
01:08:58,805 --> 01:09:01,265
Of course, we will have
to plant many seeds

607
01:09:01,600 --> 01:09:03,935
to ensure that one will grow.

608
01:09:40,848 --> 01:09:42,265
Did we find the treasure?

609
01:09:44,643 --> 01:09:47,563
Get the others up,
let's get out of here.

610
01:10:06,373 --> 01:10:08,709
Maybe we just missed
something in one of your dreams.

611
01:10:09,251 --> 01:10:11,128
My dreams weren't real.

612
01:10:11,295 --> 01:10:13,922
What do you mean?
We followed them here...

613
01:10:14,047 --> 01:10:15,966
I don't think that Vattanak's dead.

614
01:10:17,551 --> 01:10:20,596
How could he not be dead
if you're his reincarnation?

615
01:10:20,679 --> 01:10:21,847
I don't know!

616
01:10:25,684 --> 01:10:27,519
The treasure hunt is over.

617
01:10:27,728 --> 01:10:28,520
What?!

618
01:10:30,147 --> 01:10:32,399
Your family needed this treasure.
And your friends!

619
01:10:33,567 --> 01:10:38,071
Did you know there wasn't a
treasure before we came out here?

620
01:10:43,911 --> 01:10:47,080
We're all disappointed, asshole.
You're the one giving up.

621
01:11:33,377 --> 01:11:34,169
Leng Heng.

622
01:11:34,962 --> 01:11:36,547
Time for bed.

623
01:11:52,020 --> 01:11:55,357
I had the most beautiful dream.

624
01:11:56,733 --> 01:11:57,568
Yes, mom.

625
01:12:09,872 --> 01:12:10,873
Hello.

626
01:12:10,956 --> 01:12:11,748
Hello.

627
01:12:13,083 --> 01:12:13,917
Thank you.

628
01:12:15,377 --> 01:12:19,047
Thank you for allowing
your son to help me with my research.

629
01:12:20,048 --> 01:12:22,092
It was his decision.

630
01:12:22,426 --> 01:12:23,802
Thank you, Leng Heng.

631
01:12:24,720 --> 01:12:25,804
Let's go, dear.

632
01:12:35,856 --> 01:12:37,900
I'll see you in a
couple of weeks.

633
01:13:14,353 --> 01:13:15,854
Are these
from old phones?

634
01:13:16,355 --> 01:13:19,316
I haven't found
a drive in weeks.

635
01:14:08,991 --> 01:14:10,409
I want to meet him.

636
01:14:17,708 --> 01:14:19,084
That's why you're here.

637
01:14:40,814 --> 01:14:42,441
Where'd you go, Leng Heng?

638
01:16:24,168 --> 01:16:25,919
It's okay.

639
01:16:28,213 --> 01:16:29,548
You're okay.

640
01:16:59,912 --> 01:17:02,873
He wants me to come back.

641
01:17:05,792 --> 01:17:07,336
He said that to you?

642
01:17:08,086 --> 01:17:09,004
No.

643
01:17:17,554 --> 01:17:18,847
How much for this?

644
01:17:20,015 --> 01:17:20,933
Is it stolen?

645
01:17:25,896 --> 01:17:26,855
It's locked.

646
01:17:27,606 --> 01:17:30,859
If you got someone to hack it,
maybe I could sell it.

647
01:17:36,949 --> 01:17:40,244
The security on those
first gen AUGRs was full of exploits.

648
01:17:40,494 --> 01:17:42,371
Lucky you got an old one.

649
01:17:43,789 --> 01:17:47,125
You want me to wipe its memory or
just reset the configuration file?

650
01:17:47,584 --> 01:17:48,752
Don't delete anything.

651
01:17:55,509 --> 01:17:59,346
Okay, Leng Heng. Let's see what you
missed in these dreams of yours.

652
01:18:01,849 --> 01:18:03,976
Looks like we're
going to Takeo, huh.

653
01:18:07,855 --> 01:18:09,940
Leng Heng, come have some tea.

654
01:18:13,360 --> 01:18:16,488
Your family needed this treasure.
And your friends!

655
01:18:26,081 --> 01:18:27,374
Very good, Leng Heng.

656
01:18:29,543 --> 01:18:31,295
We are getting closer.

657
01:18:36,091 --> 01:18:38,844
In order to take the final
step, we must bring our

658
01:18:38,927 --> 01:18:40,721
minds into perfect alignment.

659
01:18:44,766 --> 01:18:46,435
Let us run the loop again.

660
01:19:15,130 --> 01:19:17,966
Life after life, we are reborn.

661
01:19:21,136 --> 01:19:23,931
Passed like a flame from
one candle to the next.

662
01:19:28,936 --> 01:19:31,897
Driven forward by
the wheel of karma.

663
01:19:32,314 --> 01:19:37,277
Developing, advancing, progressing
toward the ultimate goal.

664
01:19:40,072 --> 01:19:42,533
My karma led me to
build the Connectome.

665
01:19:47,704 --> 01:19:51,917
It is the sum of all of my past
lives, not bound by human form.

666
01:20:07,683 --> 01:20:12,271
But, like me, it is incomplete.

667
01:20:20,112 --> 01:20:24,241
This is why I planted
my memories in your pure mind.

668
01:20:30,956 --> 01:20:35,252
There, they have grown into
the most exquisite tree.

669
01:20:35,460 --> 01:20:39,214
A perfect record of every
past life I have lived.

670
01:20:48,974 --> 01:20:53,312
I have been preparing myself,
disconnecting from the physical world.

671
01:21:01,653 --> 01:21:05,449
And now that you're here,
we can take the final step.

672
01:21:16,293 --> 01:21:19,379
We will synchronize our minds
with the Connectome

673
01:21:20,464 --> 01:21:22,841
and enter the realm
of the infinite.

674
01:21:32,184 --> 01:21:35,187
But first, we must train our minds.

675
01:21:36,939 --> 01:21:39,900
Now, begin again.

676
01:21:40,734 --> 01:21:45,322
Begin... begin again...

677
01:22:24,111 --> 01:22:25,696
You said Leng
Heng asked for me.

678
01:22:27,114 --> 01:22:31,326
He did... through
these sketches.

679
01:22:32,536 --> 01:22:36,415
He stopped speaking a while ago.

680
01:22:38,375 --> 01:22:39,877
I went to his house.

681
01:22:40,627 --> 01:22:43,589
I thought he left
town with his family.

682
01:22:48,260 --> 01:22:54,558
Leng Heng has slipped from
reality, just like Vattanak did.

683
01:22:57,603 --> 01:23:02,900
I hope that having you here
will keep him... grounded.

684
01:23:06,987 --> 01:23:09,031
Come, he's waiting.

685
01:23:31,595 --> 01:23:35,891
Do you really think Leng Heng will
be able to wake Vattanak up?

686
01:23:36,767 --> 01:23:38,101
When I connected them,

687
01:23:38,310 --> 01:23:41,688
Vattanak's neural activity spiked
for the first time in ten years.

688
01:23:43,190 --> 01:23:44,775
So I'm hopeful, yes.

689
01:23:54,451 --> 01:23:55,410
You came.

690
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:03,335
Of course I came, idiot.

691
01:24:04,253 --> 01:24:06,672
Listen, I don't care about
the treasure anymore.

692
01:24:10,717 --> 01:24:12,511
I just want my friend back.

693
01:24:13,637 --> 01:24:16,932
Leng Heng, come home.

694
01:24:23,689 --> 01:24:26,525
I don't care
about the treasure.

695
01:24:28,026 --> 01:24:30,654
I just want my friend back.

696
01:24:35,409 --> 01:24:38,370
Come home, Leng Heng. Come home.

697
01:24:40,956 --> 01:24:42,207
Where are you going?

698
01:24:47,629 --> 01:24:50,132
You want to know who you are.

699
01:24:51,508 --> 01:24:53,510
I will tell you.

700
01:24:57,598 --> 01:25:02,728
You happened to be born in the hospital
where I was conducting my research.

701
01:25:03,937 --> 01:25:06,148
Of all the children we injected,

702
01:25:06,690 --> 01:25:11,153
you are the first child in which
the tree of my memories took root.

703
01:25:13,780 --> 01:25:18,744
And so you have been chosen by fate
for the enlightenment of mankind.

704
01:25:22,956 --> 01:25:24,291
You and I are linked.

705
01:25:26,752 --> 01:25:28,086
Linked by karma.

706
01:25:41,183 --> 01:25:42,226
Wait!

707
01:26:58,093 --> 01:27:01,013
I want to meet your machine.

708
01:27:01,096 --> 01:27:03,724
The one with perfect memory.

709
01:28:19,341 --> 01:28:20,968
Careful!
The Connectome

710
01:28:21,051 --> 01:28:22,970
requires a higher voltage.

711
01:28:41,822 --> 01:28:44,116
We have been waiting
for you, Leng Heng.

712
01:28:44,533 --> 01:28:45,659
You recognize me?

713
01:28:47,494 --> 01:28:51,039
We recognize ourselves in you.

714
01:28:52,749 --> 01:28:56,962
You are the computer that put
Vattanak's memories into my head.

715
01:28:58,255 --> 01:28:59,173
Yes.

716
01:29:06,930 --> 01:29:11,351
I want you to take Vattanak's
memories out of my head.

717
01:29:15,355 --> 01:29:16,148
Yes.

718
01:29:18,275 --> 01:29:21,236
The data is ready
to be extracted.

719
01:29:23,697 --> 01:29:24,740
What?

720
01:29:56,355 --> 01:29:57,231
Stop!

721
01:30:01,985 --> 01:30:03,779
I found what I needed.

722
01:30:07,366 --> 01:30:09,326
...there's an order
to the activity.

723
01:30:09,535 --> 01:30:12,788
It's as if the Connectome is
indexing the boy's memory.

724
01:30:12,913 --> 01:30:16,667
No, I recognize this type of
degeneration from my Alzheimer's patients.

725
01:30:17,751 --> 01:30:18,919
It's erasing his memory.

726
01:30:19,002 --> 01:30:20,337
It's erasing him?

727
01:30:28,220 --> 01:30:30,889
We must pull the tree
up by the roots.

728
01:30:32,975 --> 01:30:37,312
Seeing our memories
refracted through this pure mind...

729
01:30:37,771 --> 01:30:40,732
we are becoming...

730
01:30:41,358 --> 01:30:43,569
...enlightened.

731
01:30:52,536 --> 01:30:55,873
I am the owner of my karma.
Heir to my karma.

732
01:30:57,499 --> 01:30:58,584
Born of my karma.

733
01:30:59,960 --> 01:31:05,299
Whatever I do, for good or evil

734
01:31:05,382 --> 01:31:08,677
to that I will fall heir.

735
01:31:22,065 --> 01:31:23,108
I am sorry.

736
01:32:23,460 --> 01:32:24,753
Sit down.

737
01:32:25,921 --> 01:32:28,882
The memory extraction
is almost complete.

738
01:32:40,519 --> 01:32:41,854
You have to stop this!

739
01:33:06,420 --> 01:33:07,212
Stop!

740
01:33:54,259 --> 01:33:56,512
I know your eyes.

741
01:33:58,388 --> 01:34:02,059
This memory has been extracted.

742
01:34:08,565 --> 01:34:09,399
No.

743
01:34:09,858 --> 01:34:14,238
Vattanak's memory of this moment
has been extracted.

744
01:34:17,366 --> 01:34:19,493
But buried beneath it

745
01:34:21,245 --> 01:34:22,287
I remember

746
01:34:23,247 --> 01:34:24,998
standing here

747
01:34:25,457 --> 01:34:26,667
as another man.

748
01:34:52,401 --> 01:34:55,737
I told you we would meet again

749
01:34:55,821 --> 01:34:57,531
in another life...

750
01:36:38,757 --> 01:36:41,969
RELOCATION COMMUNITY

751
01:36:43,220 --> 01:36:44,847
Leng
Heng, you're back!

752
01:37:05,701 --> 01:37:07,494
Mom, Leng Heng is here!

753
01:37:09,288 --> 01:37:10,038
Leng Heng!

754
01:37:12,165 --> 01:37:13,750
It's so good to have
you back, dear.

755
01:37:22,885 --> 01:37:24,011
Srey Leak, come on!
