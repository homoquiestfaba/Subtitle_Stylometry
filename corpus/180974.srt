1
00:04:03,013 --> 00:04:06,801
<i>In June 1863, after more than two years</i>
<i>of bloody conflict...</i>

2
00:04:06,893 --> 00:04:10,283
<i>the Confederate army of Northern</i>
<i>Virginia, Robert E. Lee commanding...</i>

3
00:04:10,373 --> 00:04:13,410
<i>slips across the Potomac</i>
<i>to begin the invasion of the North.</i>

4
00:04:13,733 --> 00:04:16,008
<i>It is an army of 70,000 men.</i>

5
00:04:16,613 --> 00:04:18,604
<i>They move slowly behind the Blue Ridge...</i>

6
00:04:18,693 --> 00:04:21,002
<i>using the mountains</i>
<i>to screen their movements.</i>

7
00:04:21,093 --> 00:04:24,051
<i>Their objective is to draw</i>
<i>the Union army out into the open...</i>

8
00:04:24,133 --> 00:04:25,930
<i>where it can be destroyed.</i>

9
00:04:26,173 --> 00:04:29,768
<i>Late in June, the Union army</i>
<i>of the Potomac, 80,000 men...</i>

10
00:04:30,013 --> 00:04:33,642
<i>turns north from Virginia to begin</i>
<i>the great pursuit up the narrow roads...</i>

11
00:04:33,813 --> 00:04:36,373
<i>across Maryland and into Pennsylvania.</i>

12
00:04:36,733 --> 00:04:40,646
<i>General Lee knows that a letter has been</i>
<i>prepared by the Southern government.</i>

13
00:04:40,733 --> 00:04:42,564
<i>A letter which offers peace.</i>

14
00:04:42,853 --> 00:04:46,687
<i>It is to be placed on the desk</i>
<i>of Abraham Lincoln, President of the U.S...</i>

15
00:04:47,093 --> 00:04:50,290
<i>the day after Lee has destroyed</i>
<i>the Army of the Potomac...</i>

16
00:04:50,373 --> 00:04:52,523
<i>somewhere north of Washington.</i>

17
00:06:18,933 --> 00:06:21,731
Federal cavalry. Two brigades.

18
00:07:30,773 --> 00:07:34,482
-Howdy, friend. Where you headed?
-General Longstreet. I must see him.

19
00:07:34,573 --> 00:07:35,642
Is that a fact?

20
00:07:35,733 --> 00:07:38,452
I know General Lee's headquarters
are up here a little ways.

21
00:07:38,533 --> 00:07:40,410
Wherever he is, Longstreet is nearby.

22
00:07:43,893 --> 00:07:47,568
-Take me that way. This is urgent.
-Let me put it to you like this, stranger.

23
00:07:48,333 --> 00:07:51,723
You're not in a uniform
and you're coming through my picket line.

24
00:07:51,813 --> 00:07:54,805
I'll take you up there,
but if nobody there knows you...

25
00:07:55,413 --> 00:07:58,132
I guess, unfortunately,
you'll have to be hanged.

26
00:08:27,493 --> 00:08:28,846
Sir. General, sir.

27
00:08:29,853 --> 00:08:33,004
I'm sorry, excuse me, sir,
but Harrison is back.

28
00:08:35,773 --> 00:08:37,286
-Harrison?
-Yes, sir.

29
00:08:37,373 --> 00:08:39,011
The scout, Harrison, sir.

30
00:08:39,653 --> 00:08:42,087
I knew you'd want to know that
as soon as possible.

31
00:08:42,933 --> 00:08:44,764
He's right outside here, sir.

32
00:08:52,333 --> 00:08:53,652
Your servant, General.

33
00:08:54,733 --> 00:08:56,451
Didn't expect to see me, did you?

34
00:08:56,613 --> 00:08:59,889
I paid you in gold three weeks ago.
What do you got?

35
00:09:02,733 --> 00:09:04,883
I don't suppose you got
another one of those.

36
00:09:05,053 --> 00:09:06,532
That good southern tobacco.

37
00:09:06,813 --> 00:09:07,848
What do you got?

38
00:09:08,293 --> 00:09:12,366
I got the position of the Yankee army.
They're only a few miles down the road.

39
00:09:12,453 --> 00:09:15,013
The whole Yankee army coming this way.
Seven corps.

40
00:09:15,493 --> 00:09:16,528
A few miles?

41
00:09:16,613 --> 00:09:20,208
Yes. Two brigades of Yankee cavalry
down that road about...

42
00:09:20,533 --> 00:09:22,171
two, four hours away.

43
00:09:22,253 --> 00:09:24,050
Behind that there's seven corps.

44
00:09:24,373 --> 00:09:27,490
I put it all on a map, if you'd like to see it.
About 80,000 men.

45
00:09:27,973 --> 00:09:29,531
All seven corps.

46
00:09:30,093 --> 00:09:31,970
You didn't know any of that, General?

47
00:09:32,093 --> 00:09:33,970
You didn't know they were on the move.

48
00:09:34,053 --> 00:09:36,203
You wouldn't be spread so thin
if you'd known.

49
00:09:36,293 --> 00:09:38,011
How do you know we're spread out?

50
00:09:38,493 --> 00:09:42,532
Listen, General. I'm good at this business.

51
00:09:44,293 --> 00:09:47,808
Sir, I beg your pardon,
but if this man's story is true...

52
00:09:48,453 --> 00:09:50,205
why haven't we heard about it?

53
00:09:50,293 --> 00:09:53,569
General Stuart's cavalry is out there.
He would have reported.

54
00:09:55,173 --> 00:09:58,370
-What do you know about Jeb Stuart?
-He's out there all right.

55
00:09:58,573 --> 00:10:01,485
He's riding up north somewhere
getting his name in the papers.

56
00:10:01,573 --> 00:10:03,723
He hasn't caused anything but a little fuss.

57
00:10:03,853 --> 00:10:07,368
If the federal army was moving that fast,
as close as you say...

58
00:10:07,773 --> 00:10:10,287
-I have to believe General Stuart--
-Now, look here.

59
00:10:10,373 --> 00:10:13,331
I came within an angry mule's kick
of the whole Yankee cavalry.

60
00:10:14,093 --> 00:10:16,607
And all the way through a picket line.

61
00:10:17,213 --> 00:10:18,692
Hazardous, too.

62
00:10:21,053 --> 00:10:23,044
I don't know what Jeb Stuart's doing.

63
00:10:23,333 --> 00:10:25,005
I don't care. I do my job.

64
00:10:25,093 --> 00:10:27,448
Yankee cavalry's down the road,
thick as fleas...

65
00:10:27,533 --> 00:10:29,888
not two hours hard ride
from this here now spot.

66
00:10:29,973 --> 00:10:32,248
And that, by God, is the Lord's truth!

67
00:10:39,853 --> 00:10:41,491
-Major Sorrel.
-Yes, sir.

68
00:10:43,173 --> 00:10:47,052
Will you go to General Lee's headquarters
and notify him about this?

69
00:10:48,013 --> 00:10:49,241
Yes, sir.

70
00:10:51,013 --> 00:10:52,446
-Captain Goree.
-Yes, sir.

71
00:10:52,773 --> 00:10:54,365
Get this man a tent.

72
00:10:55,373 --> 00:10:57,170
And a cigar.

73
00:10:57,853 --> 00:10:58,842
Sir.

74
00:10:59,973 --> 00:11:03,170
He says the lead element is here
with the Third Corps...

75
00:11:03,493 --> 00:11:05,324
the Sixth right behind...

76
00:11:05,413 --> 00:11:07,927
supported by a column of federal cavalry.

77
00:11:08,373 --> 00:11:10,045
Seven corps all together.

78
00:11:11,333 --> 00:11:14,962
The First and Eleventh
are above Taneytown.

79
00:11:16,053 --> 00:11:18,248
And there's more cavalry two hours east.

80
00:11:18,573 --> 00:11:21,041
There may be as many
as 100,000 altogether.

81
00:11:22,493 --> 00:11:24,848
Do you believe the man, this Mr. Harrison?

82
00:11:26,173 --> 00:11:30,132
No choice. You remember him, sir,
the actor from Mississippi?

83
00:11:30,453 --> 00:11:33,411
An actor?
We move on the word of an actor?

84
00:11:34,253 --> 00:11:35,527
Can't afford not to.

85
00:11:45,253 --> 00:11:48,006
There would be some word
from General Stuart.

86
00:11:51,493 --> 00:11:53,802
General Stuart would not leave us blind.

87
00:11:56,973 --> 00:11:59,726
One other thing. Hooker's been replaced.

88
00:11:59,893 --> 00:12:03,203
George Meade's the new commander.
Harrison read it in the Yankee papers.

89
00:12:03,693 --> 00:12:06,730
George Meade, Pennsylvania man.

90
00:12:08,093 --> 00:12:10,004
Meade would be cautious, I think.

91
00:12:10,093 --> 00:12:12,209
Take him some time to get organized.

92
00:12:13,133 --> 00:12:15,044
Perhaps we should move more swiftly.

93
00:12:15,573 --> 00:12:17,370
There may be an opportunity here.

94
00:12:17,453 --> 00:12:18,442
Yes, sir.

95
00:12:20,293 --> 00:12:21,646
No reason to delay.

96
00:12:24,453 --> 00:12:26,523
I think we should concentrate here.

97
00:12:27,013 --> 00:12:29,607
All the roads converge
just east of this gap.

98
00:12:29,693 --> 00:12:32,127
-This junction will be very necessary.
-Yes, sir.

99
00:12:32,213 --> 00:12:35,125
I left my spectacles over there.
What is the name of this town?

100
00:12:38,133 --> 00:12:39,282
Gettysburg.

101
00:12:39,373 --> 00:12:40,647
Very well.

102
00:12:44,853 --> 00:12:46,491
Message for Colonel Chamberlain.

103
00:13:18,173 --> 00:13:20,641
Colonel, darling. Rise up, me bucko.

104
00:13:22,373 --> 00:13:24,887
I'm sorry, darling,
but we got a bit of a problem here.

105
00:13:24,973 --> 00:13:26,770
Would you like to hear about it?

106
00:13:26,893 --> 00:13:28,690
Would you wake up, sir?

107
00:13:29,173 --> 00:13:31,164
We got a whole company coming, sir.

108
00:13:31,373 --> 00:13:34,809
This way. I'll give you time to wake up,
but we've got quite a problem.

109
00:13:35,533 --> 00:13:39,128
Altogether, 120 men are coming.
We're to be having them as guests.

110
00:13:40,813 --> 00:13:41,882
What?

111
00:13:42,213 --> 00:13:43,646
Should be here any minute.

112
00:13:44,213 --> 00:13:46,283
-Who?
-Mutineers.

113
00:13:47,213 --> 00:13:49,169
Mutineers, Colonel, me lad.

114
00:13:49,293 --> 00:13:52,569
120 men from the old Second Maine
which has been disbanded.

115
00:13:54,493 --> 00:13:55,892
120 mutineers?

116
00:13:57,533 --> 00:13:58,727
Yes, sir.

117
00:13:59,493 --> 00:14:01,882
You see, what happened was
the enlistment papers...

118
00:14:01,973 --> 00:14:03,725
on the old Second Maine run out.

119
00:14:03,813 --> 00:14:06,373
They were sent home,
all except these 120 fellows...

120
00:14:06,453 --> 00:14:08,728
who foolishly signed three-year papers.

121
00:14:08,813 --> 00:14:10,087
Three years, that is.

122
00:14:10,413 --> 00:14:12,722
So these poor fellows
got one more year to serve.

123
00:14:12,813 --> 00:14:16,249
Only they thought they were signing
to fight only with the Second Maine...

124
00:14:16,333 --> 00:14:17,846
and the Second Maine only.

125
00:14:17,933 --> 00:14:19,127
So they...

126
00:14:20,173 --> 00:14:21,162
quit.

127
00:14:21,653 --> 00:14:24,326
They resigned, you see. 120 men.

128
00:14:26,293 --> 00:14:28,727
-Colonel, are you all right?
-Yeah.

129
00:14:29,453 --> 00:14:32,570
The point is,
these Maine fellows won't fight no more.

130
00:14:32,653 --> 00:14:35,611
Nobody can send them home
and nobody knows what to do with them.

131
00:14:35,693 --> 00:14:37,126
Until they thought of us...

132
00:14:37,253 --> 00:14:40,325
being as we are the only other
Maine regiment in the Fifth Corps.

133
00:14:40,453 --> 00:14:42,648
So they've been assigned to us.

134
00:14:43,453 --> 00:14:44,442
Yes, sir.

135
00:14:44,533 --> 00:14:47,491
I have a message here
from the new commanding general.

136
00:14:48,133 --> 00:14:49,361
George Meade, sir.

137
00:14:49,453 --> 00:14:50,488
That's right.

138
00:14:50,573 --> 00:14:52,689
Our very own general
of our very own corps...

139
00:14:52,773 --> 00:14:55,287
has been promoted
to command of the whole army.

140
00:14:55,373 --> 00:14:57,762
The latest, if you keep track of them
as they go by.

141
00:14:58,813 --> 00:15:02,886
The message says they'll be arriving
this morning and they are to join us.

142
00:15:03,853 --> 00:15:07,528
"And if they refuse to follow orders,
please feel free to shoot them."

143
00:15:08,013 --> 00:15:09,605
-To shoot them?
-Yes, sir.

144
00:15:12,333 --> 00:15:14,085
These Maine men?

145
00:15:20,373 --> 00:15:24,412
"You are hereby authorized to shoot
any man who refuses to do his duty."

146
00:15:27,053 --> 00:15:28,611
Are these all Maine men?

147
00:15:28,693 --> 00:15:31,491
Yes, sir. And fine big fellows they are, too.

148
00:15:34,413 --> 00:15:36,768
Mutiny. I thought that was
a word for the Navy.

149
00:15:41,653 --> 00:15:43,450
We'll move at sunrise.

150
00:15:46,093 --> 00:15:47,845
It's a good time of the day.

151
00:15:48,333 --> 00:15:51,052
I always do enjoy this time,
just before the dawn.

152
00:15:53,133 --> 00:15:55,806
When all this is over,
I shall miss it very much.

153
00:15:57,053 --> 00:15:58,088
Sir?

154
00:15:58,973 --> 00:16:00,691
I didn't mean the fighting.

155
00:16:04,973 --> 00:16:06,725
It's all in God's hands now.

156
00:16:08,493 --> 00:16:09,482
Good day, sir.

157
00:16:10,173 --> 00:16:11,322
Good day to you.

158
00:16:22,893 --> 00:16:24,087
General, sir.

159
00:16:24,813 --> 00:16:28,726
Should I wake them up, sir? Should I
get them waked up and get going?

160
00:16:28,813 --> 00:16:30,087
No, Moxley.

161
00:16:30,613 --> 00:16:33,207
Let the boys sleep a little longer.
They'll need it.

162
00:16:33,293 --> 00:16:34,521
Yes, sir.

163
00:17:00,333 --> 00:17:02,688
Prisoners, mark file, left!

164
00:17:02,933 --> 00:17:06,323
How many men do we have now
in the 20th Maine?

165
00:17:06,413 --> 00:17:09,450
Somewhere around 250, sir,
counting the officers.

166
00:17:10,013 --> 00:17:13,164
How the heck are we supposed
to take care of 120 men?

167
00:17:14,453 --> 00:17:16,762
Colonel, it's going to be a hot day today.

168
00:17:17,293 --> 00:17:21,081
Seeing as you already been down
with the heat, will you ride the horse...

169
00:17:21,173 --> 00:17:25,485
that the good Lord provided,
instead of marching in the dirty dust?

170
00:17:25,773 --> 00:17:27,092
You walked.

171
00:17:27,333 --> 00:17:30,325
Darling, I've been in the infantry
since you was in books.

172
00:17:30,413 --> 00:17:33,883
After the first few thousand miles,
a man gets limber with his feet.

173
00:17:34,013 --> 00:17:35,446
Morning, Lawrence.

174
00:17:36,573 --> 00:17:38,768
How are you?
You're looking kind of peaked.

175
00:17:38,853 --> 00:17:40,730
Darn it, Tom. Don't call me Lawrence.

176
00:17:42,533 --> 00:17:44,046
It doesn't make sense.

177
00:17:44,173 --> 00:17:46,482
Hold a gun on a man to get him to fight.

178
00:17:53,813 --> 00:17:56,008
Detail, about face.

179
00:17:58,733 --> 00:18:00,086
Attention, detail!

180
00:18:00,653 --> 00:18:03,167
You heard the Captain. Stand at attention!

181
00:18:03,733 --> 00:18:06,167
Guards, get these men back on their feet!

182
00:18:15,613 --> 00:18:17,888
I'm looking for commanding officer,
20th Maine.

183
00:18:17,973 --> 00:18:18,962
You found him.

184
00:18:19,053 --> 00:18:21,123
-That's him, all right.
-You're Chamberlain?

185
00:18:21,973 --> 00:18:23,725
Colonel Chamberlain to you.

186
00:18:25,773 --> 00:18:27,206
Captain Brewer, sir.

187
00:18:27,493 --> 00:18:29,131
118th Pennsylvania.

188
00:18:30,293 --> 00:18:33,603
If you're the commanding officer,
I present you with these prisoners.

189
00:18:33,773 --> 00:18:35,047
You're welcome to them.

190
00:18:35,133 --> 00:18:37,852
Lord knows, I had to use the bayonet
to keep them moving.

191
00:18:39,853 --> 00:18:41,809
You have to sign for them.

192
00:18:43,253 --> 00:18:44,971
Sign it, Lieutenant.

193
00:18:55,013 --> 00:18:56,492
You are relieved, Captain.

194
00:18:58,253 --> 00:19:01,051
You are authorized to use
whatever force necessary.

195
00:19:01,613 --> 00:19:03,046
You want to shoot them...

196
00:19:04,013 --> 00:19:05,446
go right ahead.

197
00:19:05,893 --> 00:19:07,531
Won't nobody say nothing.

198
00:19:12,853 --> 00:19:14,923
I said you are relieved, Captain.

199
00:19:27,093 --> 00:19:29,607
You men can leave now.
We won't be needing any guards.

200
00:19:37,013 --> 00:19:40,164
My name is Chamberlain.
I'm the Colonel of the 20th Maine.

201
00:19:43,133 --> 00:19:45,488
When did you have something to eat?

202
00:19:47,133 --> 00:19:49,567
They're trying to break us
by not feeding us.

203
00:19:50,813 --> 00:19:51,928
We ain't broke yet.

204
00:19:52,333 --> 00:19:55,166
They just told me you were coming
a little while ago.

205
00:19:55,533 --> 00:19:56,932
I'll get the cook going.

206
00:19:57,013 --> 00:19:59,322
The meat may be raw,
but there's no time to cook.

207
00:19:59,413 --> 00:20:02,928
We've got quite a ways to go today.
You'll be coming with us, so eat hearty.

208
00:20:03,173 --> 00:20:05,971
We'll set you up in those trees.
Sergeant Tozier, see to it.

209
00:20:06,093 --> 00:20:07,287
Yes, sir.

210
00:20:11,533 --> 00:20:14,843
You boys go eat, then I'll come over
and hear what you have to say.

211
00:20:21,693 --> 00:20:23,285
Colonel, we've got grievances.

212
00:20:26,813 --> 00:20:28,963
The men elected me to talk for them.

213
00:20:29,853 --> 00:20:32,321
All right. You come along with me.

214
00:20:33,053 --> 00:20:36,363
The rest of you boys go eat.
We're going to get moving in a little bit.

215
00:20:43,653 --> 00:20:45,723
All right, men, on your feet.

216
00:20:45,853 --> 00:20:48,413
-Gosh, Lawrence.
-Smile. Don't call me Lawrence.

217
00:20:48,493 --> 00:20:50,245
-Are they moving?
-Yes, sir.

218
00:20:51,053 --> 00:20:52,884
Forward, march.

219
00:20:52,973 --> 00:20:54,531
What's your name?

220
00:20:55,693 --> 00:20:57,684
I don't feel too kindly, Colonel.

221
00:20:58,893 --> 00:21:01,202
Yes, well, I'm usually not this informal.

222
00:21:01,293 --> 00:21:04,808
I just took command
of this regiment a few days ago.

223
00:21:04,893 --> 00:21:08,010
Somebody ought to welcome you
to my...our outfit.

224
00:21:09,133 --> 00:21:13,206
They tell me they're holding you fellows
because you signed three-year papers.

225
00:21:13,333 --> 00:21:15,608
I'm sorry. Would you like some coffee?

226
00:21:16,173 --> 00:21:17,401
Are you sure?

227
00:21:20,093 --> 00:21:22,448
-Go ahead. Sit down, Mister....
-Bucklin.

228
00:21:23,253 --> 00:21:24,732
Joseph Bucklin.

229
00:21:26,253 --> 00:21:29,723
Listen, Colonel.
I've been in 11 different engagements.

230
00:21:30,293 --> 00:21:31,931
How many have you been in?

231
00:21:34,453 --> 00:21:35,727
Not that many.

232
00:21:35,893 --> 00:21:37,531
It ain't the papers.

233
00:21:37,973 --> 00:21:40,806
I've done my share. We all have.

234
00:21:41,413 --> 00:21:44,291
They are damn good men.
Shouldn't be used this way.

235
00:21:47,013 --> 00:21:48,287
Look here.

236
00:21:49,973 --> 00:21:51,565
It went clean through.

237
00:21:53,453 --> 00:21:54,886
We got a courier coming.

238
00:21:57,453 --> 00:22:00,445
Listen, Colonel. I'm tired.

239
00:22:01,493 --> 00:22:03,609
You know what I mean? I'm tired.

240
00:22:03,733 --> 00:22:08,204
I've had all this army, all these officers....
This damn Hooker, this damn idiot Meade.

241
00:22:08,373 --> 00:22:12,651
All of them. The whole bloody, lousy mess
of sick-brained, potbellied scareheads.

242
00:22:12,733 --> 00:22:14,928
They ain't fit to lead a johnny detail.

243
00:22:15,013 --> 00:22:18,767
They ain't fit to pour pee out of a boot
with instructions written under the heel.

244
00:22:20,493 --> 00:22:21,767
I'm tired.

245
00:22:22,453 --> 00:22:24,762
We're good men
and we had our own good flag.

246
00:22:25,973 --> 00:22:29,283
These damn idiots used us
like we were cows or dogs or worse.

247
00:22:29,813 --> 00:22:31,326
We aren't gonna win this war.

248
00:22:31,413 --> 00:22:34,291
We can't win with these
lame-brained bastards from West Point.

249
00:22:34,853 --> 00:22:37,242
These damn gentlemen! These officers!

250
00:22:39,133 --> 00:22:40,691
The courier, sir.

251
00:22:44,533 --> 00:22:45,966
Don't go away.

252
00:22:48,373 --> 00:22:49,726
Colonel Chamberlain, sir.

253
00:22:49,813 --> 00:22:52,964
Colonel Vincent wishes to inform you
the Fifth Corps is moving out.

254
00:22:53,053 --> 00:22:55,726
You and the 20th Maine Regiment
are instructed to lead.

255
00:22:55,813 --> 00:22:59,726
20th Maine's assigned first position in line.
Send out advanced guards and flankers.

256
00:22:59,813 --> 00:23:01,531
-Flankers?
-Yes, flankers.

257
00:23:02,253 --> 00:23:04,687
Right, yes.
My compliments to the Colonel.

258
00:23:05,493 --> 00:23:07,927
Captain Clark, you heard him.
Get the regiment up.

259
00:23:08,053 --> 00:23:10,009
Sound the assembly. Strike the tents.

260
00:23:11,973 --> 00:23:15,045
You better get something to eat.
Looks like you could use it.

261
00:23:15,133 --> 00:23:16,851
Tell your men I'm coming.

262
00:23:16,933 --> 00:23:19,493
The boys from the Second Maine
are being fed, Lawrence.

263
00:23:19,573 --> 00:23:21,165
Don't call me Lawrence.

264
00:23:21,853 --> 00:23:23,809
Damn it, Lawrence. I'm your brother.

265
00:23:23,893 --> 00:23:26,407
Be careful about the name business
in front of the men.

266
00:23:26,493 --> 00:23:28,688
Because we're brothers,
it looks like favoritism.

267
00:23:28,773 --> 00:23:31,162
General Meade got his own son
as his aide-de-camp.

268
00:23:31,293 --> 00:23:33,887
That's different. Generals can do anything.

269
00:23:34,173 --> 00:23:37,165
Nothing quite so much like God on earth
as a general on battlefield.

270
00:23:38,573 --> 00:23:41,770
What are you going to do with them?
Colonel, sir.

271
00:23:42,333 --> 00:23:45,052
You can't shoot them.
You never go back to Maine if you do.

272
00:23:45,133 --> 00:23:46,452
I know that.

273
00:23:47,853 --> 00:23:49,445
I wonder if they do.

274
00:23:54,613 --> 00:23:56,968
Colonel, sir. You know who this man is?

275
00:23:57,053 --> 00:23:59,567
Dan Burns, from Orono.
I know his daddy, the preacher.

276
00:23:59,653 --> 00:24:01,132
Best cusser I ever heard.

277
00:24:01,213 --> 00:24:03,966
Knows more fine swear words
than any man in Maine.

278
00:24:22,493 --> 00:24:24,131
You men gather around.

279
00:24:36,693 --> 00:24:40,527
I've been talking with Private Bucklin.
He's told me about your problem.

280
00:24:42,093 --> 00:24:43,890
There's nothing I can do today.

281
00:24:43,973 --> 00:24:46,771
We're moving out in a few minutes.
We'll be moving all day.

282
00:24:46,853 --> 00:24:49,526
I've been ordered
to take you men with me.

283
00:24:49,893 --> 00:24:51,406
I'm told that...

284
00:24:53,493 --> 00:24:55,404
if you don't come, I can shoot you.

285
00:24:57,293 --> 00:24:59,523
Well, you know I won't do that.

286
00:25:00,013 --> 00:25:02,288
Maybe somebody else will, but I won't.

287
00:25:02,573 --> 00:25:04,086
So, that's that.

288
00:25:04,533 --> 00:25:06,603
Here's the situation.

289
00:25:07,533 --> 00:25:11,242
The whole reb army is up that road
a ways waiting for us.

290
00:25:11,333 --> 00:25:13,051
This is no time for an argument.

291
00:25:13,133 --> 00:25:15,283
I tell you, we could surely use you fellows.

292
00:25:15,413 --> 00:25:17,563
We're now well below half strength.

293
00:25:17,653 --> 00:25:21,009
Whether you fight or not, that's up to you.

294
00:25:21,293 --> 00:25:24,808
Whether you come along is....
Well, you're coming.

295
00:25:26,053 --> 00:25:27,611
You know who we are, why we're here.

296
00:25:27,733 --> 00:25:30,611
If you fight alongside us,
there's a few things you must know.

297
00:25:31,013 --> 00:25:34,289
This regiment was formed
last summer in Maine.

298
00:25:35,973 --> 00:25:37,964
There were 1,000 of us then.

299
00:25:38,453 --> 00:25:40,808
There are less than 300 of us now.

300
00:25:45,333 --> 00:25:48,564
All of us volunteered to fight
for the Union, just as you did.

301
00:25:50,453 --> 00:25:53,411
Some came mainly because
we were bored at home.

302
00:25:54,493 --> 00:25:56,848
Thought this looked like it might be fun.

303
00:25:58,293 --> 00:26:00,568
Some came because
we were ashamed not to.

304
00:26:02,933 --> 00:26:06,972
Many of us came
because it was the right thing to do.

305
00:26:10,653 --> 00:26:12,609
And all of us have seen men die.

306
00:26:14,933 --> 00:26:16,924
This is a different kind of army.

307
00:26:17,013 --> 00:26:20,130
If you look back through history,
you'll see men fighting for pay...

308
00:26:20,213 --> 00:26:22,727
for women, for some other kind of loot.

309
00:26:22,813 --> 00:26:24,963
They fight for land, power.

310
00:26:27,253 --> 00:26:30,165
Because a king leads them,
or just because they like killing.

311
00:26:31,693 --> 00:26:33,524
We are here for something new.

312
00:26:33,973 --> 00:26:37,329
This has not happened much
in the history of the world.

313
00:26:39,453 --> 00:26:42,331
We are an army out to set other men free.

314
00:26:44,693 --> 00:26:47,253
America should be free ground.

315
00:26:48,853 --> 00:26:49,888
All of it.

316
00:26:50,293 --> 00:26:53,205
Not divided by a line
between slave state and free.

317
00:26:53,293 --> 00:26:57,081
All the way from here to the Pacific Ocean.

318
00:27:00,053 --> 00:27:01,645
No man has to bow.

319
00:27:03,213 --> 00:27:05,169
No man born to royalty.

320
00:27:05,293 --> 00:27:08,922
Here we judge you by what you do,
not by who your father was.

321
00:27:11,093 --> 00:27:12,811
Here you can be something.

322
00:27:13,733 --> 00:27:16,372
Here is the place to build a home.

323
00:27:19,213 --> 00:27:21,010
But it's not the land.

324
00:27:22,293 --> 00:27:24,204
There's always more land.

325
00:27:26,773 --> 00:27:30,163
It's the idea that we all have value.

326
00:27:32,733 --> 00:27:34,052
You and me.

327
00:27:38,293 --> 00:27:42,252
What we're fighting for, in the end...

328
00:27:46,213 --> 00:27:48,204
we're fighting for each other.

329
00:28:00,773 --> 00:28:01,762
Sorry.

330
00:28:03,013 --> 00:28:04,685
I didn't mean to preach.

331
00:28:07,333 --> 00:28:08,527
You go ahead.

332
00:28:09,653 --> 00:28:10,881
You talk for a while.

333
00:28:14,213 --> 00:28:18,001
If you choose to join us and want
your muskets back, you can have them.

334
00:28:18,613 --> 00:28:21,173
Nothing more will be said
by anybody, anywhere.

335
00:28:21,973 --> 00:28:25,807
If you choose not to join us,
you can come along under guard.

336
00:28:25,893 --> 00:28:27,849
When this is over, I'll do what I can...

337
00:28:27,933 --> 00:28:30,970
to see you get a fair treatment,
but for now, we're moving out.

338
00:28:37,013 --> 00:28:38,366
Gentlemen.

339
00:28:39,733 --> 00:28:41,883
I think if we lose this fight...

340
00:28:44,013 --> 00:28:45,651
we lose the war.

341
00:28:47,813 --> 00:28:52,011
So, if you choose to join us,
I'll be personally very grateful.

342
00:29:15,533 --> 00:29:17,364
Colonel, it's a fine morning.

343
00:29:17,453 --> 00:29:19,808
-Captain Spear, are we ready?
-Sir, that we are.

344
00:29:19,893 --> 00:29:21,645
Then let's move out.

345
00:29:21,933 --> 00:29:23,525
20th Maine!

346
00:29:24,293 --> 00:29:25,282
Forward!

347
00:29:26,893 --> 00:29:27,882
March!

348
00:31:25,533 --> 00:31:26,966
That's infantry, all right.

349
00:31:27,773 --> 00:31:29,445
At least a whole brigade.

350
00:31:30,773 --> 00:31:31,967
Any sign of cavalry?

351
00:31:32,733 --> 00:31:34,007
Not a lick, sir.

352
00:31:34,453 --> 00:31:35,932
That's strange.

353
00:31:36,293 --> 00:31:38,568
Infantry moving alone
in enemy country, blind.

354
00:31:38,653 --> 00:31:40,052
Very strange, sir.

355
00:31:41,173 --> 00:31:42,526
What do you make of that?

356
00:31:43,133 --> 00:31:44,646
He's headed this way.

357
00:31:44,733 --> 00:31:45,768
Sir?

358
00:31:46,293 --> 00:31:48,170
Lee's turned. That's the main body.

359
00:31:48,253 --> 00:31:49,527
You think so?

360
00:31:50,493 --> 00:31:53,530
-I thought they were going to Harrisburg.
-He was.

361
00:31:53,773 --> 00:31:56,241
That's too many troops
to be a raiding party.

362
00:31:57,053 --> 00:31:58,406
There's power behind it.

363
00:31:58,693 --> 00:32:02,242
Sir, if you want to fight here,
this is such lovely ground.

364
00:32:02,973 --> 00:32:05,123
It's the best damn ground I've seen all day.

365
00:32:05,213 --> 00:32:06,487
It is that.

366
00:32:11,613 --> 00:32:13,683
We'll move both brigades into town.

367
00:32:14,133 --> 00:32:16,328
That'll make the good citizens happy.

368
00:32:18,173 --> 00:32:19,731
Let's go down and have a look.

369
00:33:04,573 --> 00:33:08,327
-Soldier, your shirt needs mending.
-I thought the war was in Virginia.

370
00:33:10,653 --> 00:33:12,291
What division are you boys with?

371
00:33:21,813 --> 00:33:23,371
Colonel, do you mind?

372
00:33:23,693 --> 00:33:26,969
A good officer doesn't ride all day.
I've been sitting too long anyway.

373
00:33:27,173 --> 00:33:28,731
What do you think?

374
00:33:28,813 --> 00:33:31,327
-What do you think?
-About what?

375
00:33:31,413 --> 00:33:33,483
About the Second Maine boys, what else?

376
00:33:33,573 --> 00:33:35,291
Are any of them going to join us?

377
00:33:35,413 --> 00:33:37,449
Would you believe it? All but six!

378
00:33:37,773 --> 00:33:38,762
What?

379
00:33:38,853 --> 00:33:41,765
I counted by actual vote.
114 voted to pick up the rifle.

380
00:33:42,173 --> 00:33:44,812
-Well, I'll be.
-You did good, brother, real good!

381
00:33:44,893 --> 00:33:46,929
Good. See to it they march together.

382
00:33:47,013 --> 00:33:49,686
Yes. Glazier's got the hardheads in tow.
There are six.

383
00:33:49,773 --> 00:33:52,003
Get the names.
Put them in different companies.

384
00:33:52,093 --> 00:33:54,243
I want them spread out,
not bunched together.

385
00:33:54,333 --> 00:33:57,052
-I'll see about their muskets.
-Colonel, sir.

386
00:35:09,493 --> 00:35:11,723
You know what's happening here
in the morning?

387
00:35:11,813 --> 00:35:12,802
Sir?

388
00:35:12,893 --> 00:35:15,282
The whole damn rebel army
is gonna be here.

389
00:35:16,173 --> 00:35:19,245
They'll move through this town,
occupy the hills on the other side.

390
00:35:19,333 --> 00:35:23,451
When our people arrive, Lee'll have
high ground. There'll be the devil to pay.

391
00:35:23,533 --> 00:35:25,046
The high ground!

392
00:35:27,133 --> 00:35:31,649
Meade will come in slowly, cautiously,
new to command.

393
00:35:33,093 --> 00:35:35,402
They'll be on his back from Washington.

394
00:35:36,013 --> 00:35:38,971
Wires hot with messages. Attack! Attack!

395
00:35:41,333 --> 00:35:43,847
So he will set up a ring around these hills.

396
00:35:45,493 --> 00:35:49,805
And when Lee's army is nicely entrenched
behind fat rocks on the high ground...

397
00:35:49,893 --> 00:35:52,646
Meade will finally attack,
if he can coordinate the army.

398
00:35:53,253 --> 00:35:55,892
Straight up the hillside, out in the open...

399
00:35:56,533 --> 00:35:58,649
in that gorgeous field of fire.

400
00:36:00,533 --> 00:36:05,288
We will charge valiantly
and be butchered valiantly.

401
00:36:10,013 --> 00:36:13,892
And afterward, men in tall hats and
gold watch fobs will thump their chest...

402
00:36:13,973 --> 00:36:16,362
and say what a brave charge it was.

403
00:36:24,893 --> 00:36:26,645
Devin, I've led a soldier's life...

404
00:36:27,933 --> 00:36:31,050
and I've never seen anything
as brutally clear as this.

405
00:36:31,573 --> 00:36:35,725
It's as if I can actually see the blue troops
in one long bloody moment...

406
00:36:36,533 --> 00:36:39,001
going up the long slope to the stony top...

407
00:36:40,653 --> 00:36:42,609
as if it were already done...

408
00:36:43,373 --> 00:36:45,091
and already a memory.

409
00:36:45,693 --> 00:36:47,570
An odd, set...

410
00:36:48,973 --> 00:36:50,804
stony quality to it.

411
00:36:52,573 --> 00:36:56,532
As if tomorrow has already happened
and there's nothing you can do about it.

412
00:36:57,573 --> 00:37:00,406
The way you sometimes feel
before an ill-considered attack...

413
00:37:00,493 --> 00:37:02,370
knowing it will fail...

414
00:37:02,533 --> 00:37:04,330
but you cannot stop it.

415
00:37:05,413 --> 00:37:08,052
You must even take part and help it fail.

416
00:37:13,253 --> 00:37:14,845
We have 2,500 men.

417
00:37:15,893 --> 00:37:17,884
They'll be coming in force.

418
00:37:19,013 --> 00:37:22,562
There could be 20,000
coming down that road in the morning.

419
00:37:26,133 --> 00:37:29,603
If we hold this ridge for a couple of hours,
we can keep them away.

420
00:37:29,693 --> 00:37:32,161
We can block that road
until our main body gets here.

421
00:37:32,573 --> 00:37:35,041
We can deprive the enemy
of the high ground!

422
00:37:35,653 --> 00:37:38,531
The boys are ready for a brawl.
No doubt of that.

423
00:37:38,613 --> 00:37:40,569
We'll force the reb to deploy.

424
00:37:41,133 --> 00:37:43,408
That's a narrow road
they'll be coming down.

425
00:37:43,813 --> 00:37:48,091
If we stack them up, it will take them a
while to get on track to get into position.

426
00:37:48,853 --> 00:37:50,172
Is Calef's battery up yet?

427
00:37:50,813 --> 00:37:52,769
His six guns are deploying now.

428
00:37:52,933 --> 00:37:55,128
How far back is Reynolds
with the main force?

429
00:37:55,613 --> 00:37:57,649
About 10 miles, sir. Not much more.

430
00:38:07,973 --> 00:38:10,282
Sir, you were right.

431
00:38:11,133 --> 00:38:14,011
My scouts report the rebel army
is coming this way for sure.

432
00:38:14,093 --> 00:38:16,561
They're all concentrating in this direction.

433
00:38:25,733 --> 00:38:28,042
We'll hold here in the morning.

434
00:38:28,773 --> 00:38:31,606
Long enough for Reynolds
and the infantry to arrive.

435
00:38:32,253 --> 00:38:34,687
If we hang on to the high ground,
we have a chance...

436
00:38:34,773 --> 00:38:36,684
to win this fight that's coming.

437
00:38:37,213 --> 00:38:39,363
-Understood?
-Yes, sir.

438
00:38:39,973 --> 00:38:43,283
Post the cannon along this road,
the Chambersburg Pike.

439
00:38:43,973 --> 00:38:47,966
The rebels will hit us at dawn.
I think we can hold them at least 2 hours.

440
00:38:48,053 --> 00:38:50,692
Hell, General,
we can hold them all the livelong day.

441
00:38:50,773 --> 00:38:52,001
He's right, sir.

442
00:38:52,213 --> 00:38:54,522
At Thoroughfare Gap,
you held against Longstreet.

443
00:38:54,613 --> 00:38:57,685
-You held for six hours.
-They never came. We held for nothing.

444
00:39:04,773 --> 00:39:07,526
The rebs will hit us just about first light.

445
00:39:08,093 --> 00:39:09,685
Keep a clear eye.

446
00:39:10,693 --> 00:39:13,048
Have the pickets give us a good warning.

447
00:39:13,373 --> 00:39:14,647
All right, gentlemen.

448
00:39:15,213 --> 00:39:16,726
Let's get posted.

449
00:39:49,813 --> 00:39:52,885
<i>General Reynolds,</i>
<i>my troops are deployed on good ground...</i>

450
00:39:52,973 --> 00:39:55,771
<i>west of Gettysburg</i>
<i>on the Chambersburg Pike.</i>

451
00:39:58,613 --> 00:40:01,127
<i>I've sent reconnaissance parties</i>
<i>in every direction...</i>

452
00:40:01,213 --> 00:40:03,681
<i>from which the enemy</i>
<i>might be approaching.</i>

453
00:40:03,773 --> 00:40:06,890
<i>I'm satisfied A.P. Hill's corps</i>
<i>is massed just west of here...</i>

454
00:40:06,973 --> 00:40:08,565
<i>back of Cashtown.</i>

455
00:40:08,853 --> 00:40:11,890
<i>The enemy's pickets</i>
<i>are within four miles of my position.</i>

456
00:40:12,573 --> 00:40:15,690
<i>Rumor says Ewell's coming</i>
<i>over the mountains from Carlisle.</i>

457
00:40:20,693 --> 00:40:24,049
<i>If true, two Confederate corps</i>
<i>will converge upon us in the morning.</i>

458
00:40:24,173 --> 00:40:26,448
<i>One from the west and one from the north.</i>

459
00:40:26,533 --> 00:40:29,206
<i>Do you want me to hold</i>
<i>this position if attacked?</i>

460
00:40:29,653 --> 00:40:31,450
<i>Confirmation requested.</i>

461
00:40:32,733 --> 00:40:34,086
<i>J.N.O. Buford.</i>

462
00:40:56,413 --> 00:40:58,563
<i>"Bow down thy heaven, O Lord.</i>

463
00:40:59,293 --> 00:41:02,888
<i>"Come down and touch the mountains</i>
<i>and they shall smoke.</i>

464
00:41:04,173 --> 00:41:09,122
<i>"Blessed be the Lord, my strength,</i>
<i>which teaches my fingers to fight...</i>

465
00:41:09,853 --> 00:41:12,890
<i>"and my hands to war. Amen. "</i>

466
00:41:15,293 --> 00:41:16,965
Good morning, Lucy.

467
00:41:18,493 --> 00:41:20,563
Traveler, good morning to you, sir.

468
00:41:24,133 --> 00:41:25,202
Good morning, sir.

469
00:41:25,573 --> 00:41:26,972
Good morning, Major Taylor.

470
00:41:27,053 --> 00:41:29,567
-Will the General have some breakfast?
-No, thank you.

471
00:41:29,653 --> 00:41:31,644
We have flapjacks in small mountains.

472
00:41:31,733 --> 00:41:35,123
Fresh butter, bacon, wagons of ham,
apple butter, ripe cherries.

473
00:41:35,453 --> 00:41:37,125
You really ought to pitch in, sir.

474
00:41:37,213 --> 00:41:40,091
Courtesy of our host,
the great Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.

475
00:41:52,213 --> 00:41:53,487
Good morning, sir.

476
00:41:53,893 --> 00:41:55,690
General Longstreet, good morning.

477
00:41:59,933 --> 00:42:01,605
Federal forces are concentrating.

478
00:42:01,693 --> 00:42:04,810
Yes, and I've confirmed
some of your man Harrison's information.

479
00:42:04,893 --> 00:42:07,361
Their new commander
is definitely George Meade.

480
00:42:10,533 --> 00:42:12,683
I have reports of Union cavalry
in Gettysburg.

481
00:42:13,413 --> 00:42:14,607
Cavalry?

482
00:42:14,973 --> 00:42:16,804
General Hill reports only militia.

483
00:42:17,533 --> 00:42:18,522
He did?

484
00:42:20,053 --> 00:42:21,372
Well, it's cavalry.

485
00:42:21,453 --> 00:42:24,047
Where there's cavalry,
infantry will be close behind.

486
00:42:24,213 --> 00:42:25,362
Meade's closing fast.

487
00:42:25,453 --> 00:42:27,967
It could be he's thinking
of swinging round behind us.

488
00:42:28,053 --> 00:42:31,932
Behind, in front: direction does not matter.
We'll fight him wherever he is.

489
00:42:32,013 --> 00:42:35,722
Probably got old Abe Lincoln on his back
frantic to throw us out of Pennsylvania.

490
00:42:35,813 --> 00:42:37,485
We may have an opportunity here.

491
00:42:38,133 --> 00:42:39,168
I agree.

492
00:42:39,973 --> 00:42:43,329
Our objective was to get their army
out of Virginia and into the open.

493
00:42:43,493 --> 00:42:45,131
Now they are in the open.

494
00:42:45,453 --> 00:42:47,489
General Meade has been forcing
the march.

495
00:42:47,933 --> 00:42:49,651
The weather has been unusually hot.

496
00:42:49,733 --> 00:42:53,362
He will probably arrive here worn out
and weary, piece by piece.

497
00:42:53,733 --> 00:42:56,452
If we concentrate,
we can hit him as he comes up.

498
00:42:56,613 --> 00:42:59,411
If we can take out a few of his corps,
we can even the odds.

499
00:42:59,493 --> 00:43:02,326
But we must strike hard
and we must strike quickly.

500
00:43:03,693 --> 00:43:05,251
What artillery is that, Major?

501
00:43:05,653 --> 00:43:06,972
I don't know, sir.

502
00:43:07,173 --> 00:43:08,731
General Heth is in front.

503
00:43:08,813 --> 00:43:12,044
-My instructions were clear?
-Yes, sir. To all commanders.

504
00:43:12,133 --> 00:43:15,125
Avoid contact with the enemy
until the army's up and concentrated.

505
00:43:15,213 --> 00:43:16,282
And General Heth?

506
00:43:16,373 --> 00:43:18,523
He has instructions
not to force major action.

507
00:43:18,613 --> 00:43:19,932
I told him this morning.

508
00:43:20,013 --> 00:43:22,732
We should move closer to the front.
Send for General Heth.

509
00:43:22,813 --> 00:43:25,043
-I must know what is going on.
-Yes, sir.

510
00:43:26,493 --> 00:43:27,482
General...

511
00:43:29,053 --> 00:43:32,648
in the fight that is coming,
I want you to stay back from the main line.

512
00:43:32,733 --> 00:43:35,566
This army has lost too many
of its veteran commanders...

513
00:43:35,653 --> 00:43:39,123
and you, sir, have a very bad habit
of moving too far forward.

514
00:43:42,373 --> 00:43:43,726
Can't lead from behind.

515
00:43:44,053 --> 00:43:45,566
May I say it plainly, sir.

516
00:43:46,053 --> 00:43:47,645
I cannot afford to lose you.

517
00:43:49,173 --> 00:43:52,688
Now, General, let's look to this day.
You may bring up your corps.

518
00:43:59,213 --> 00:44:02,125
Major Taylor, have Traveler saddled up.

519
00:44:02,973 --> 00:44:05,441
-I'm going to look around for myself.
-Yes, sir.

520
00:45:17,773 --> 00:45:20,162
They've got a brigade in position
and that's all.

521
00:45:20,853 --> 00:45:24,732
We've got the best damn ground around,
and they're hitting me with one brigade.

522
00:45:25,693 --> 00:45:27,331
Lovely.

523
00:45:38,773 --> 00:45:40,445
Go on down, gentlemen.

524
00:45:56,493 --> 00:45:57,642
Fall back!

525
00:46:02,573 --> 00:46:03,972
They are on the run.

526
00:46:14,413 --> 00:46:15,562
Close crop, General.

527
00:46:15,653 --> 00:46:17,723
-How are your losses?
-Not bad at all, sir.

528
00:46:18,053 --> 00:46:20,567
We got them out in the open.
Really got a twist on them.

529
00:46:20,653 --> 00:46:23,406
They are arrogant people, you know?
They came right at us.

530
00:46:24,133 --> 00:46:27,489
We took some prisoners.
They're from Heth's division of Hill's corps.

531
00:46:27,573 --> 00:46:29,404
That's what I've got in front of me.

532
00:46:29,493 --> 00:46:32,485
A new division. 8,000 men more or less.
All within sound of this.

533
00:46:32,573 --> 00:46:36,122
Just back up that road between here
and Cashtown. A little ways up the road.

534
00:46:36,253 --> 00:46:38,448
It'll take them a little while to get on line.

535
00:46:38,533 --> 00:46:41,809
Yes, sir, but Hill's whole corps is behind.
Maybe 25,000.

536
00:46:41,893 --> 00:46:44,453
Longstreet behind that.
Ewell over there to the north.

537
00:46:44,533 --> 00:46:45,807
I know, Colonel.

538
00:46:45,893 --> 00:46:49,568
When John Reynolds gets here,
he won't have the full army with him.

539
00:46:49,653 --> 00:46:50,722
Only part of it.

540
00:46:50,813 --> 00:46:53,566
The point is, the rebs will be here
this afternoon...

541
00:46:53,653 --> 00:46:56,565
with everything they've got.
I just thought I'd mention it.

542
00:46:57,413 --> 00:46:59,643
What do you want me to do here, sir?

543
00:47:00,293 --> 00:47:01,806
Heth will be back in a bit.

544
00:47:02,213 --> 00:47:04,807
If he's got any brains at all,
and he's not stupid...

545
00:47:04,933 --> 00:47:07,925
he'll know by now he's got at least
a brigade in front of him.

546
00:47:08,013 --> 00:47:10,163
He won't wait
to get his whole division in line.

547
00:47:10,253 --> 00:47:11,925
That would take half the morning.

548
00:47:12,013 --> 00:47:13,731
He don't need his whole division.

549
00:47:15,773 --> 00:47:16,888
That's right.

550
00:47:17,293 --> 00:47:20,205
Does Devin report any activity on his front
over to the right?

551
00:47:20,493 --> 00:47:22,529
-No, sir. Not a lick.
-All right.

552
00:47:23,013 --> 00:47:25,652
I'll have Devin leave his cover
and withdraw his boys...

553
00:47:25,733 --> 00:47:28,645
and have them move in alongside you,
lengthening your line.

554
00:47:29,733 --> 00:47:32,293
When Heth gets back,
he'll run into two brigades.

555
00:47:32,773 --> 00:47:35,003
That ought to hold him
until Reynolds gets here.

556
00:47:35,293 --> 00:47:36,282
Right, sir.

557
00:47:40,253 --> 00:47:43,643
Damn sure glad the rain is gone.
Don't want anything to slow up Reynolds.

558
00:47:48,853 --> 00:47:50,445
Take care of yourself, Colonel.

559
00:47:51,373 --> 00:47:53,762
Don't worry about me, sir.
I'm the soul of caution.

560
00:48:46,133 --> 00:48:47,122
Fire!

561
00:48:50,493 --> 00:48:52,404
Move! Fall back!

562
00:49:36,693 --> 00:49:38,843
That flank.... Hold it!

563
00:49:45,893 --> 00:49:47,121
Keep up your fire!

564
00:49:57,253 --> 00:49:58,481
Gamble's down, sir.

565
00:49:58,573 --> 00:50:00,848
Colonel Gamble, but he's not hurt bad, sir.

566
00:50:08,053 --> 00:50:09,372
I'm all right.

567
00:50:11,813 --> 00:50:13,292
It was close, that's all.

568
00:50:22,733 --> 00:50:25,691
Sir, Colonel Devin's compliments.
No problem on the right.

569
00:50:25,773 --> 00:50:28,333
They came up close,
but we put in the reserve.

570
00:50:28,413 --> 00:50:29,971
We didn't put it all in, sir.

571
00:50:30,053 --> 00:50:32,089
Wishes to know if you have further orders.

572
00:50:32,173 --> 00:50:34,368
Tell Devin all reserve forward, now.

573
00:50:44,973 --> 00:50:46,088
Keep up your fire!

574
00:50:49,373 --> 00:50:50,362
Fire!

575
00:50:52,293 --> 00:50:53,282
Fire!

576
00:51:47,333 --> 00:51:48,812
Sir, it's General Reynolds.

577
00:52:02,453 --> 00:52:03,442
Thank God.

578
00:52:12,773 --> 00:52:13,842
What goes, John?

579
00:52:14,253 --> 00:52:15,766
There's the devil to pay!

580
00:52:16,053 --> 00:52:18,248
-Can you hold?
-I reckon I can.

581
00:52:27,973 --> 00:52:32,285
Heth probably has about 10,000 men
coming down that road, wouldn't you say?

582
00:52:32,373 --> 00:52:34,443
Yes, sir. But there'll be more behind him.

583
00:52:34,533 --> 00:52:38,048
We can put almost 20,000 in the field.
We're in very good shape, I think.

584
00:52:38,573 --> 00:52:39,642
For a while, sir.

585
00:52:40,173 --> 00:52:43,927
I'm sending messages to all commanders
to come here with all possible speed.

586
00:52:49,333 --> 00:52:50,561
It's lovely ground.

587
00:52:52,653 --> 00:52:54,245
I thought so, sir.

588
00:52:56,493 --> 00:52:58,529
Now let's go surprise Harry Heth.

589
00:53:12,213 --> 00:53:13,089
Come on.

590
00:53:18,773 --> 00:53:21,003
-General Heth.
-Sir. I beg to report.

591
00:53:21,213 --> 00:53:22,202
Yes.

592
00:53:22,613 --> 00:53:24,968
Very strange, sir.
The situation is very confused.

593
00:53:25,053 --> 00:53:26,042
What happened?

594
00:53:26,133 --> 00:53:28,647
I moved in this morning, as directed.

595
00:53:28,973 --> 00:53:32,409
I thought it was only a few militia,
but it was dismounted cavalry, sir.

596
00:53:32,973 --> 00:53:35,851
There weren't all that many,
and the boys wouldn't hold back.

597
00:53:36,013 --> 00:53:38,971
I thought we shouldn't be stopped
by a few dismounted cavalry...

598
00:53:39,053 --> 00:53:40,486
but they made a good fight.

599
00:53:40,573 --> 00:53:42,564
They really put up a scrap, sir.

600
00:53:43,533 --> 00:53:44,568
Go on, General.

601
00:53:44,893 --> 00:53:46,770
Well, sir, they wouldn't leave.

602
00:53:47,133 --> 00:53:48,851
My boys got their dander up.

603
00:53:48,933 --> 00:53:51,288
We deployed the whole division
and went after them.

604
00:53:51,373 --> 00:53:53,967
We just about had them running
then all of a sudden...

605
00:53:54,053 --> 00:53:55,611
they got infantry support.

606
00:53:55,693 --> 00:53:57,046
We got pushed back.

607
00:53:57,133 --> 00:54:01,445
Then we re-formed and tried again.
We couldn't just leave it to them, sir.

608
00:54:01,933 --> 00:54:05,209
Now there's more Yankee infantry coming.
I don't know how many.

609
00:54:05,293 --> 00:54:07,329
But I don't know
what else we could've done.

610
00:54:07,413 --> 00:54:09,643
It started as a minor scrap
with a few militia.

611
00:54:09,733 --> 00:54:12,645
The next thing I know,
I'm tangling with half the Union army.

612
00:54:13,773 --> 00:54:17,129
Things will get out of control, Mr. Heth.
That is why we have orders.

613
00:54:17,533 --> 00:54:19,842
-Is it possible you misunderstood them?
-No, sir.

614
00:54:20,613 --> 00:54:21,887
Can you identify those people?

615
00:54:21,973 --> 00:54:24,248
The infantry is the First Corps,
the Black Hats.

616
00:54:24,413 --> 00:54:27,166
There's another corps coming
that we haven't identified.

617
00:54:27,253 --> 00:54:29,847
I must have all possible information
on enemy strength.

618
00:54:29,933 --> 00:54:33,846
Major Taylor, I want you to ride forward
to the highest position and observe.

619
00:54:33,933 --> 00:54:35,446
-And do be careful.
-Yes, sir.

620
00:54:35,813 --> 00:54:37,610
-Sir, shall I attack?
-No, sir.

621
00:54:37,813 --> 00:54:39,644
We are not ready for full engagement.

622
00:54:39,733 --> 00:54:41,644
General Longstreet is not up
with his corps.

623
00:54:41,733 --> 00:54:43,451
Sir, the enemy is disorganized.

624
00:54:43,693 --> 00:54:46,924
If we throw all our forces in the field,
we will have the advantage.

625
00:54:48,173 --> 00:54:49,401
Is that our artillery?

626
00:54:50,013 --> 00:54:51,002
Yes, sir.

627
00:54:51,293 --> 00:54:53,568
I can't imagine what has happened
to General Stuart.

628
00:54:53,653 --> 00:54:55,928
-I've heard nothing. Do you understand?
-Yes, sir.

629
00:54:56,013 --> 00:54:59,926
I have no idea of what lies in front of me.
It may be the entire federal army.

630
00:55:20,333 --> 00:55:22,722
Sir, compliments of Colonel Babbit.

631
00:55:23,053 --> 00:55:26,045
Rebels are coming from the north.
Your instructions, sir?

632
00:55:26,133 --> 00:55:28,601
That'll be Ewell's corps.
They're trying to flank us.

633
00:55:28,813 --> 00:55:31,373
We got to meet them
and force them to go on line.

634
00:55:31,653 --> 00:55:34,326
Tell Colonel Devin to get up that way
as quick as he can.

635
00:55:34,573 --> 00:55:37,849
We'll get Gamble's boys back in the saddle
and be there shortly.

636
00:55:59,693 --> 00:56:02,002
General Rodes has encountered
Yankee cavalry, sir.

637
00:56:02,093 --> 00:56:03,208
Buford's brigades.

638
00:56:03,573 --> 00:56:07,043
General Early's right behind him
and will be on the field within the hour.

639
00:56:10,493 --> 00:56:14,088
General Early may be attacked
by half the federal army within the hour.

640
00:56:14,693 --> 00:56:17,446
-Is that Pender's artillery?
-Yes, sir. He's up now, sir.

641
00:56:17,613 --> 00:56:20,764
Four batteries in position
with two more in reserve.

642
00:56:21,293 --> 00:56:25,445
With General Rodes attacking up there
and Pender and I, we have three divisions.

643
00:56:25,653 --> 00:56:27,052
We could sweep them.

644
00:56:27,573 --> 00:56:28,562
General, sir.

645
00:56:28,653 --> 00:56:31,247
I saw only two federal corps.
First and Eleventh.

646
00:56:31,493 --> 00:56:35,566
And, General, I saw Early's lead columns
coming down north of Rodes' lines.

647
00:56:35,733 --> 00:56:37,530
He'll be engaged any minute, sir.

648
00:56:37,613 --> 00:56:41,083
Sir, we got 20,000 infantry coming down
almost behind the Union lines.

649
00:56:41,813 --> 00:56:43,166
It's perfect, sir.

650
00:56:44,053 --> 00:56:45,247
God's will.

651
00:56:46,853 --> 00:56:49,845
Gentlemen, it would appear
the fight is already underway.

652
00:56:50,453 --> 00:56:52,284
General Heth, you may attack, sir.

653
00:56:52,373 --> 00:56:54,523
My orders to all commanders: attack.

654
00:57:24,653 --> 00:57:25,642
Fire!

655
00:58:13,293 --> 00:58:16,012
Forward men, final brigade forward!

656
00:58:34,093 --> 00:58:36,448
Forward! For God's sake, forward!

657
00:59:03,693 --> 00:59:04,762
He's dead.

658
00:59:23,173 --> 00:59:27,007
One thing about this brigade
is we got our own special bugle call.

659
00:59:27,613 --> 00:59:29,444
Ever hear tell of Dan Butterfield?

660
00:59:29,533 --> 00:59:31,763
What, General Butterfield?
What was with Hooker?

661
00:59:31,853 --> 00:59:33,127
That's the same fellow.

662
00:59:33,773 --> 00:59:36,731
-He used to be our brigade commander.
-Yeah, he was a pistol.

663
00:59:36,813 --> 00:59:40,089
-No man like him for having a good time.
-I don't know about that.

664
00:59:40,613 --> 00:59:42,888
But I know he used to like
to write bugle calls.

665
00:59:43,333 --> 00:59:45,767
The problem with this army is,
we got too many calls.

666
00:59:45,853 --> 00:59:49,243
We got a call for artillery, infantry,
get up and eat, retreat.

667
00:59:50,213 --> 00:59:53,603
Anyway, old Butterfield, he wrote
a special call for this here brigade.

668
00:59:54,093 --> 00:59:56,561
Say there is an order for this brigade,
you and me.

669
00:59:56,653 --> 01:00:00,248
He'll be blowing his bugle, we will think
that order's for us when it wasn't.

670
01:00:00,653 --> 01:00:04,282
We'll follow that order anyway,
then we'll be in a world of hurt.

671
01:00:04,373 --> 01:00:06,648
Yeah, that happened to me once.
Us, that is.

672
01:00:06,733 --> 01:00:09,201
Half the regiment charged,
the other half retreated.

673
01:00:09,293 --> 01:00:10,692
You had your choice.

674
01:00:11,693 --> 01:00:13,684
This here brigade got a special call.

675
01:00:13,933 --> 01:00:16,606
You hear that call,
you know the next one is for you.

676
01:00:17,013 --> 01:00:18,287
It goes like this.

677
01:00:21,293 --> 01:00:22,408
Colonel, sir.

678
01:00:23,053 --> 01:00:24,725
Begging the Colonel's pardon.

679
01:00:25,293 --> 01:00:29,332
But would the Colonel please do us a favor
and get back on the damned horse?

680
01:00:29,893 --> 01:00:33,203
I'll tell you, sir,
it's not easy handling these new recruits...

681
01:00:33,773 --> 01:00:36,970
when the officers act
like they ain't got any sense, sir.

682
01:00:39,373 --> 01:00:40,488
Lawrence, sir.

683
01:00:41,973 --> 01:00:44,009
We've gone over 20 miles today.

684
01:00:44,453 --> 01:00:46,762
We've gone over 100 miles
in five days, sir.

685
01:00:49,533 --> 01:00:51,285
There's something going on.

686
01:00:58,173 --> 01:01:00,243
-Colonel Vincent, sir.
-Mister Chamberlain.

687
01:01:00,333 --> 01:01:02,403
Far cry from Bowdoin College,
wouldn't you say?

688
01:01:02,493 --> 01:01:04,051
No farther than Harvard Yard.

689
01:01:04,453 --> 01:01:07,843
Indeed. With luck, we'll both see
our alma maters again.

690
01:01:08,813 --> 01:01:11,885
In the meantime, Colonel, you move
your boys along as best you can.

691
01:01:12,293 --> 01:01:14,124
Two corps have engaged at Gettysburg.

692
01:01:14,533 --> 01:01:17,286
So we'll keep going through dark
and on until we get there.

693
01:01:17,373 --> 01:01:18,362
Yes, sir.

694
01:01:18,453 --> 01:01:19,442
Godspeed.

695
01:01:37,933 --> 01:01:39,002
Fire!

696
01:02:29,693 --> 01:02:30,967
They're running!

697
01:02:37,773 --> 01:02:40,606
General Pender begs to report
that the enemy is falling back.

698
01:02:40,693 --> 01:02:42,763
-They're on the run.
-Very well, Lieutenant.

699
01:02:45,333 --> 01:02:49,326
General Early says the enemy has caved in
on the left flank, going back to Gettysburg.

700
01:02:49,413 --> 01:02:52,086
-They're all running.
-Very well. Thank you, Corporal.

701
01:02:52,653 --> 01:02:54,564
Find General Hill's chief of artillery.

702
01:02:54,653 --> 01:02:57,725
Tell him I want fire placed on that hill.
As much fire as possible.

703
01:02:57,813 --> 01:02:59,371
-Yes, sir.
-Very well.

704
01:03:04,653 --> 01:03:06,132
-Major Taylor.
-Yes, sir.

705
01:03:06,213 --> 01:03:07,851
Deliver this message in person.

706
01:03:07,933 --> 01:03:11,005
Tell General Ewell the federal troops
are withdrawing in confusion.

707
01:03:11,413 --> 01:03:14,246
We must only push those people
in order to gain the heights.

708
01:03:14,933 --> 01:03:18,050
Tell him to take that hill, if practical.
The one beyond the town.

709
01:03:18,133 --> 01:03:19,202
Do you understand?

710
01:03:19,293 --> 01:03:20,965
-Yes, sir.
-Very well.

711
01:03:31,893 --> 01:03:33,246
Congratulations, General.

712
01:03:33,333 --> 01:03:34,607
I want you to see this.

713
01:03:34,693 --> 01:03:36,649
It's like second Manassas all over again.

714
01:03:36,733 --> 01:03:38,963
Couldn't have worked better
if we'd planned it.

715
01:03:39,053 --> 01:03:42,648
If we can take that hill,
I want it occupied by nightfall.

716
01:03:42,733 --> 01:03:45,645
Sir, the federal army has fallen back
through Gettysburg.

717
01:03:45,933 --> 01:03:48,208
They're reforming on the ridges
outside of town.

718
01:03:48,293 --> 01:03:49,328
Very well.

719
01:03:50,213 --> 01:03:52,773
This is almost perfect.
We got them where we want them.

720
01:03:53,413 --> 01:03:56,086
Let's move south and east,
get between them and Lincoln...

721
01:03:56,213 --> 01:03:57,566
find some high ground...

722
01:03:57,653 --> 01:03:59,291
and they'll have to hit us.

723
01:03:59,413 --> 01:04:01,404
Then we have them, General.

724
01:04:01,493 --> 01:04:02,642
You mean disengage?

725
01:04:03,413 --> 01:04:05,404
I've always been under the impression...

726
01:04:05,493 --> 01:04:09,122
that it was our strategy to conduct
a defensive campaign wherever possible...

727
01:04:09,213 --> 01:04:11,010
in order to keep the army intact.

728
01:04:11,093 --> 01:04:13,163
Granted, but the situation has changed.

729
01:04:13,693 --> 01:04:15,843
-In what way?
-We've already pushed them back.

730
01:04:15,933 --> 01:04:17,810
They're on the run, vacating the town.

731
01:04:18,093 --> 01:04:20,926
How can we move off
in the face of the enemy?

732
01:04:21,213 --> 01:04:23,010
-Major Marshall?
-Yes, sir.

733
01:04:23,133 --> 01:04:25,806
I ordered firing on that hill,
but no cannons are firing.

734
01:04:25,893 --> 01:04:28,248
-Send over and find out why.
-I'll see to it, sir.

735
01:04:28,333 --> 01:04:29,322
Thank you.

736
01:04:33,493 --> 01:04:35,245
What are you thinking, General?

737
01:04:37,653 --> 01:04:39,564
Maybe we should not have fought here.

738
01:04:39,813 --> 01:04:42,930
I know that. But we have prevailed.
The men have prevailed.

739
01:04:43,093 --> 01:04:44,606
Yes. They've always done that.

740
01:04:44,693 --> 01:04:47,412
But in the morning,
we may be outnumbered...

741
01:04:47,493 --> 01:04:50,690
and they'll be entrenched
on the high ground.

742
01:04:50,893 --> 01:04:54,283
You know as well as I, we've never been
concerned with being outnumbered.

743
01:04:54,373 --> 01:04:56,091
That is true, sir. You are right.

744
01:04:56,333 --> 01:04:59,052
If we move south to Washington,
they have to pursue us.

745
01:04:59,133 --> 01:05:01,203
Then we can fight on ground
of our choosing.

746
01:05:01,493 --> 01:05:02,812
But the enemy is here.

747
01:05:03,373 --> 01:05:05,807
We did not want the fight,
but the fight is here.

748
01:05:05,893 --> 01:05:09,602
How can I ask this army to retreat
in the face of what they've done this day?

749
01:05:10,173 --> 01:05:12,209
Not retreat, sir. Re-deploy.

750
01:05:12,933 --> 01:05:16,642
Our guns will move them off that hill
or Ewell will push them off.

751
01:05:16,733 --> 01:05:19,486
But if Meade is there tomorrow,
I can't move this army away.

752
01:05:19,573 --> 01:05:20,688
I will attack him.

753
01:05:20,773 --> 01:05:24,322
If Meade is up there tomorrow,
it is because he wants us to attack him.

754
01:05:24,413 --> 01:05:27,246
We pushed back two corps,
but there are five more coming.

755
01:05:32,573 --> 01:05:34,928
General, I will bring up my boys
as soon as I can.

756
01:05:35,093 --> 01:05:36,082
Very well.

757
01:05:36,853 --> 01:05:38,002
-General?
-Sir?

758
01:05:38,493 --> 01:05:40,802
Your man Harrison, the actor,
he was quite correct.

759
01:05:41,293 --> 01:05:45,081
Had it not been for him, this entire army
might have been destroyed in detail.

760
01:05:45,333 --> 01:05:48,530
The federal force might've been here
waiting when we turned around.

761
01:05:48,693 --> 01:05:50,490
I'm deeply grateful to you, sir.

762
01:06:22,933 --> 01:06:23,922
Hello, men.

763
01:06:25,493 --> 01:06:26,926
What outfit are you with?

764
01:06:27,693 --> 01:06:29,490
Archer's brigade, Heth's division.

765
01:06:30,133 --> 01:06:32,010
-Where are you from?
-Tennessee.

766
01:06:32,493 --> 01:06:33,482
How about you?

767
01:06:33,773 --> 01:06:34,762
Maine.

768
01:06:35,693 --> 01:06:37,126
I've never been to Tennessee.

769
01:06:37,333 --> 01:06:39,244
I reckon I've never been to Maine neither.

770
01:06:41,333 --> 01:06:43,767
I don't mean no disrespect
to you fighting men...

771
01:06:44,973 --> 01:06:49,171
but sometimes I can't help but figure,
why are you fighting this war?

772
01:06:49,493 --> 01:06:50,846
Why are you fighting it?

773
01:06:51,173 --> 01:06:54,529
To free the slaves, of course.
And to preserve the Union.

774
01:06:55,293 --> 01:06:58,649
I don't know about other folk,
but I ain't fighting for no darkies.

775
01:06:59,413 --> 01:07:00,846
I'm fighting for my rights.

776
01:07:01,133 --> 01:07:02,851
That's what we're all fighting for.

777
01:07:02,933 --> 01:07:03,922
For your what?

778
01:07:04,053 --> 01:07:05,042
For our rights.

779
01:07:07,093 --> 01:07:09,971
Why is it you folks can't just live
the way you want to live...

780
01:07:10,053 --> 01:07:11,725
and let us live the way we do?

781
01:07:12,853 --> 01:07:15,162
"Live and let live," I hear some folks say.

782
01:07:17,373 --> 01:07:20,331
Be a mite less fuss and bother
if more folks took it to heart.

783
01:07:22,893 --> 01:07:24,326
Where'd you get captured?

784
01:07:24,693 --> 01:07:26,763
Railroad cut just west of Gettysburg town.

785
01:07:27,133 --> 01:07:28,691
It wasn't a pretty sight.

786
01:07:30,453 --> 01:07:32,921
Many a good boy lost
a young and promising life.

787
01:07:34,773 --> 01:07:36,365
Some wore blue, some wore gray.

788
01:07:39,813 --> 01:07:41,371
Seen enough of this war?

789
01:07:42,773 --> 01:07:44,047
I guess I have.

790
01:07:45,213 --> 01:07:46,487
I guess I have, too.

791
01:07:47,733 --> 01:07:50,088
It looks like I'll be sitting out the rest of it.

792
01:07:53,773 --> 01:07:55,365
I appreciate you talking to me.

793
01:07:56,453 --> 01:07:57,932
See you in hell, Billy Yank.

794
01:07:59,413 --> 01:08:01,210
See you in hell, Johnny Reb.

795
01:08:10,373 --> 01:08:12,170
I have found a John Henry, sir.

796
01:08:12,373 --> 01:08:13,362
John who?

797
01:08:13,453 --> 01:08:16,650
A John Henry, sir. A runaway.
I heard him a-groaning.

798
01:08:29,933 --> 01:08:30,922
Is he wounded?

799
01:08:31,213 --> 01:08:32,612
Don't know for sure.

800
01:08:38,933 --> 01:08:40,127
The man's exhausted.

801
01:08:40,533 --> 01:08:43,366
We'll get him something to eat.
The surgeon's on the way.

802
01:08:45,093 --> 01:08:48,130
-Did you get his name?
-He said something I couldn't understand.

803
01:08:48,213 --> 01:08:50,681
I can't understand anyone
south of Mason-Dixon.

804
01:08:50,773 --> 01:08:52,047
Rebs or darkies.

805
01:09:02,493 --> 01:09:05,166
All right, men, as you were.
Surgeon, see to him.

806
01:09:16,013 --> 01:09:18,527
We used to have visitors from the South
before the war.

807
01:09:18,613 --> 01:09:21,685
They were always very polite, academic,
you understand.

808
01:09:23,093 --> 01:09:25,846
We stayed off the question of slavery
out of courtesy.

809
01:09:26,653 --> 01:09:29,451
But toward the end there was
no getting away from it...

810
01:09:29,573 --> 01:09:32,963
and yet I could never understand.
I don't now.

811
01:09:34,133 --> 01:09:35,486
I don't know why.

812
01:09:38,293 --> 01:09:39,772
They fight so well.

813
01:09:47,413 --> 01:09:49,131
Tell me something, Buster...

814
01:09:50,533 --> 01:09:52,364
what do you think of Negroes?

815
01:09:55,093 --> 01:09:56,765
Well, if you mean the race...

816
01:09:58,573 --> 01:09:59,847
I don't really know.

817
01:10:00,813 --> 01:10:02,644
This is not a thing to be ashamed of.

818
01:10:03,173 --> 01:10:07,007
The thing is, you cannot judge a race.

819
01:10:07,893 --> 01:10:10,487
Any man who judges by the group
is a pea-wit.

820
01:10:11,693 --> 01:10:13,923
You take men one at a time.

821
01:10:14,573 --> 01:10:16,643
To me, there was never any difference.

822
01:10:17,413 --> 01:10:19,244
-None at all?
-None at all.

823
01:10:19,333 --> 01:10:21,722
Of course, I haven't known
that many freed men...

824
01:10:21,813 --> 01:10:24,452
but those I knew in Bangor, Portland...

825
01:10:26,213 --> 01:10:28,329
you look in the eye, there was a man.

826
01:10:29,653 --> 01:10:32,372
There was a "divine spark,"
as my mother used to call it.

827
01:10:32,693 --> 01:10:34,092
That is all there is to it.

828
01:10:34,613 --> 01:10:36,012
Races are men.

829
01:10:38,013 --> 01:10:39,651
"What a piece of work is man.

830
01:10:40,373 --> 01:10:43,251
"How infinite in faculties,
in form and moving...

831
01:10:44,293 --> 01:10:45,806
"how express and admirable.

832
01:10:48,213 --> 01:10:49,885
"In action, how like an angel."

833
01:10:53,533 --> 01:10:55,763
Well, if he's an angel, all right then...

834
01:10:57,493 --> 01:10:59,848
but he damn well must be a killer angel.

835
01:11:04,853 --> 01:11:08,004
Colonel, darling, you're a lovely man.

836
01:11:08,973 --> 01:11:13,046
I see a great vast difference between us,
yet I admire you, lad.

837
01:11:14,453 --> 01:11:17,286
You're an idealist, praise be.

838
01:11:19,093 --> 01:11:20,765
The truth is, Colonel...

839
01:11:22,093 --> 01:11:24,129
there is no "divine spark."

840
01:11:25,613 --> 01:11:29,686
There's many a man alive no more of value
than a dead dog. Believe me.

841
01:11:30,413 --> 01:11:34,122
When you've seen them hang each other
the way I have back in the Old Country.

842
01:11:35,613 --> 01:11:36,602
Equality?

843
01:11:37,333 --> 01:11:41,645
What I'm fighting for is the right to prove
I'm a better man than many of them.

844
01:11:42,133 --> 01:11:46,365
Where have you seen this "divine spark"
in operation, Colonel?

845
01:11:47,813 --> 01:11:50,771
Where have you noted
this magnificent equality?

846
01:11:52,053 --> 01:11:54,851
No two things on earth are equal
or have an equal chance.

847
01:11:55,413 --> 01:11:57,210
Not a leaf, not a tree.

848
01:11:59,173 --> 01:12:01,812
There's many a man worse than me
and some better...

849
01:12:02,893 --> 01:12:05,965
but I don't think race or country
matters a damn.

850
01:12:07,773 --> 01:12:09,365
What matters, Colonel...

851
01:12:12,413 --> 01:12:13,402
is justice.

852
01:12:19,453 --> 01:12:21,011
Which is why I'm here.

853
01:12:22,333 --> 01:12:24,449
I'll be treated as I deserve...

854
01:12:25,893 --> 01:12:28,009
not as my father deserved.

855
01:12:30,413 --> 01:12:31,812
I'm Kilrain...

856
01:12:32,453 --> 01:12:35,092
and I damn all gentlemen.

857
01:12:39,293 --> 01:12:41,329
There is only one aristocracy...

858
01:12:43,093 --> 01:12:45,732
and that is right here.

859
01:12:53,813 --> 01:12:56,281
And that's why we've got to win this war.

860
01:13:09,293 --> 01:13:10,282
Howdy.

861
01:13:11,293 --> 01:13:12,726
Howdy, General.

862
01:13:13,893 --> 01:13:16,168
Hello, my boys. Virginia has arrived!

863
01:13:25,613 --> 01:13:27,683
General Pickett presents
his compliments...

864
01:13:27,773 --> 01:13:31,243
and asks to <i>parler</i> with
the commanding general, <i>s'il vous plat</i>.

865
01:13:32,013 --> 01:13:33,207
Hey, George.

866
01:13:34,533 --> 01:13:35,602
General.

867
01:13:40,933 --> 01:13:42,651
Good Lord, what is that smell?

868
01:13:42,893 --> 01:13:44,884
That's me. Ain't it lovely?

869
01:13:45,613 --> 01:13:47,205
He got it off a dead Frenchman.

870
01:13:47,453 --> 01:13:49,364
-Good evening to you, James.
-Hey, Lo.

871
01:13:49,453 --> 01:13:51,603
I did not get it off a dead Frenchman.

872
01:13:52,013 --> 01:13:54,243
I bought it in a store
in Richmond with Sally.

873
01:13:54,333 --> 01:13:57,530
It did have a French name,
but Miss Corbert likes it.

874
01:13:58,613 --> 01:13:59,602
Excuse me.

875
01:13:59,693 --> 01:14:02,082
Gentlemen? Colonel Fremantle?

876
01:14:03,453 --> 01:14:05,808
Allow me to introduce
Major General George Pickett.

877
01:14:06,013 --> 01:14:08,607
General Pickett,
Lieutenant Colonel Arthur Fremantle...

878
01:14:08,693 --> 01:14:12,083
of Her Majesty's venerable
and elite Cold Stream Guards...

879
01:14:12,413 --> 01:14:14,802
Britain's military attach<i></i>
to the Confederacy...

880
01:14:14,893 --> 01:14:18,010
and, you might say,
the eyes and ears of Queen Victoria.

881
01:14:18,413 --> 01:14:21,769
Hardly, sir. I'm merely an observer
and your humble guest.

882
01:14:25,053 --> 01:14:27,328
The fame of your regiment
has preceded you.

883
01:14:28,133 --> 01:14:30,886
General Pickett here
is our ranking strategist.

884
01:14:31,933 --> 01:14:36,404
The First Corps Army of Northern Virginia.
We refer all our deeper questions to him.

885
01:14:36,533 --> 01:14:38,091
They do. They do indeed.

886
01:14:38,413 --> 01:14:41,371
His record at West Point
is still the talk of both armies.

887
01:14:41,773 --> 01:14:45,812
You know I consider it unbecoming
to a soldier, all this book learning.

888
01:14:45,893 --> 01:14:48,851
-Book learning ain't for gentlemen, right?
-Nor that either.

889
01:14:49,853 --> 01:14:52,208
He graduated last in his class. Dead last.

890
01:14:52,773 --> 01:14:54,809
Quite a feat, considering his classmates.

891
01:14:57,213 --> 01:15:00,649
The Yankees got all the smart ones.
Look where it's got them.

892
01:15:03,053 --> 01:15:04,566
Let me present my commanders.

893
01:15:04,653 --> 01:15:08,248
Each one of these chaps, as you might say,
commands a brigade of mine.

894
01:15:08,573 --> 01:15:10,962
Now this fellow here, this is Lo Armistead.

895
01:15:11,053 --> 01:15:13,521
Lo! That's short for Lothario.

896
01:15:13,853 --> 01:15:14,888
The lover!

897
01:15:15,413 --> 01:15:18,371
This here is Richard Brooke Garnett.
You'll pardon his limp.

898
01:15:18,453 --> 01:15:20,728
He got kicked by his horse the other day.

899
01:15:20,813 --> 01:15:22,007
That fellow there....

900
01:15:22,653 --> 01:15:23,847
That's Jim Kemper.

901
01:15:24,453 --> 01:15:26,762
You note the shifty eye,
the hand in the pocket.

902
01:15:27,213 --> 01:15:29,283
He's not even a West Pointer,
so watch him.

903
01:15:29,373 --> 01:15:32,490
He's a politician from Virginia.
Jimmy's only here for the votes.

904
01:15:32,733 --> 01:15:34,689
I was Speaker of the House in Virginia.

905
01:15:34,813 --> 01:15:38,522
As a matter of fact, I'd like to talk to you
about some political matters.

906
01:15:39,013 --> 01:15:40,571
You know the Queen, don't you?

907
01:15:40,933 --> 01:15:44,130
What I need to know
and tell my folks back home is:

908
01:15:44,413 --> 01:15:46,244
When are you going to do something...

909
01:15:46,333 --> 01:15:49,006
about that damn Yankee blockade
out there on the water?

910
01:15:49,093 --> 01:15:50,970
Can you tell me something about that?

911
01:15:51,173 --> 01:15:54,085
Have you heard any news of old Winfield?

912
01:15:54,893 --> 01:15:56,246
Old Winnie boy?

913
01:15:57,013 --> 01:15:58,810
Hancock? Oh, yeah.

914
01:16:00,573 --> 01:16:02,325
Well, how's he doing?

915
01:16:02,813 --> 01:16:04,451
You're going to find out.

916
01:16:06,693 --> 01:16:09,844
He's got the Second Corps.

917
01:16:11,093 --> 01:16:14,085
He's headed this way. Probably run
into him in the next few days.

918
01:16:18,813 --> 01:16:20,531
I wish I could see him again.

919
01:16:21,893 --> 01:16:24,123
I haven't seen him since before the war.

920
01:16:26,613 --> 01:16:28,649
Never thought it would last this long.

921
01:16:29,533 --> 01:16:31,012
Me neither, Lo.

922
01:16:31,693 --> 01:16:34,048
I sure would like to talk
to old Hancock again.

923
01:16:35,213 --> 01:16:36,532
One more time.

924
01:16:40,933 --> 01:16:41,968
Well, why not?

925
01:16:44,253 --> 01:16:45,402
You wouldn't mind?

926
01:16:45,493 --> 01:16:46,482
Hell, no.

927
01:16:48,253 --> 01:16:49,572
I mean, really.

928
01:16:50,173 --> 01:16:54,132
Do you think it would be proper?
You know, ethical?

929
01:16:55,613 --> 01:16:57,604
When the time comes, and he's close...

930
01:16:58,053 --> 01:17:01,523
just send a messenger over
under a flag of truce and go on over.

931
01:17:01,933 --> 01:17:03,207
Ain't nothing to it.

932
01:17:04,693 --> 01:17:06,809
Last time I saw him was in California.

933
01:17:08,053 --> 01:17:09,930
Right when the war was beginning...

934
01:17:10,573 --> 01:17:13,610
the night before we all left
to go fight against each other.

935
01:17:15,133 --> 01:17:17,044
Old friends off to war.

936
01:17:22,293 --> 01:17:23,442
How's your brigade?

937
01:17:24,813 --> 01:17:27,725
I've never seen troops anywhere
so ready for a brawl.

938
01:17:29,413 --> 01:17:32,325
I've got to give the old man credit.
A lot of credit for that.

939
01:17:32,853 --> 01:17:35,925
Who else could've held
this army together for so long?

940
01:17:37,693 --> 01:17:40,287
Remember what they used to say
about him?

941
01:17:40,413 --> 01:17:44,406
When he first took command?
They called him "Old Granny."

942
01:17:46,653 --> 01:17:49,292
Lord, what damn fools we were.

943
01:17:50,733 --> 01:17:52,883
Now when he passes...

944
01:17:53,733 --> 01:17:57,203
the boys hush as if they had seen
an angel of the Lord.

945
01:17:59,693 --> 01:18:01,923
Have you ever seen anything like that?

946
01:18:03,373 --> 01:18:05,250
No. I can't say I have.

947
01:18:07,293 --> 01:18:09,648
It's amazing what one honest man can do.

948
01:18:10,333 --> 01:18:12,369
One honest man and a cause.

949
01:18:14,773 --> 01:18:17,128
I don't think on that too much anymore.

950
01:18:19,413 --> 01:18:21,529
I guess my only cause is victory.

951
01:18:21,933 --> 01:18:24,686
This war comes as a nightmare.
You pick your nightmare side.

952
01:18:24,773 --> 01:18:26,843
Then you put your head down and win.

953
01:18:28,653 --> 01:18:30,132
Old gloomy Pete!

954
01:18:30,933 --> 01:18:32,207
You see, Colonel....

955
01:18:32,573 --> 01:18:36,202
The government derives its power
from the consent of the people.

956
01:18:36,373 --> 01:18:38,011
Every government, everywhere.

957
01:18:39,653 --> 01:18:41,803
Let me make this very plain to you, sir.

958
01:18:42,213 --> 01:18:45,364
We do not consent
and we will never consent.

959
01:18:46,213 --> 01:18:49,250
And what you've got to do is,
you've got to go back over there...

960
01:18:49,333 --> 01:18:52,370
to your Parliament and you've got
to make it very plain to them.

961
01:18:52,453 --> 01:18:55,206
You've got to tell them
that what we're fighting for here...

962
01:18:55,373 --> 01:18:59,332
is the freedom from what we consider
to be the rule of a foreign power.

963
01:18:59,413 --> 01:19:02,291
I mean, that's all we want.
That's what this war is all about.

964
01:19:02,773 --> 01:19:06,652
Now we established this country
in the first place...

965
01:19:06,893 --> 01:19:08,884
with very strong state governments...

966
01:19:09,333 --> 01:19:10,925
just for that very reason.

967
01:19:11,453 --> 01:19:13,683
I mean, let me put it to you this way.

968
01:19:13,973 --> 01:19:15,964
My home is in Virginia.

969
01:19:16,693 --> 01:19:19,366
The government of my home is home.

970
01:19:20,093 --> 01:19:22,482
Virginia would not allow itself
to be ruled...

971
01:19:22,573 --> 01:19:25,041
by some king over there in London.

972
01:19:25,453 --> 01:19:29,082
It's not about to let itself be ruled
by some president in Washington.

973
01:19:29,293 --> 01:19:32,524
Virginia, by God, sir,
is going to be run by Virginians.

974
01:19:32,773 --> 01:19:34,445
Oh, my. The Cause.

975
01:19:34,733 --> 01:19:36,689
Actually, Jimmy, I got a pair of kings.

976
01:19:36,893 --> 01:19:38,485
And it's all for the Yankees.

977
01:19:38,733 --> 01:19:40,530
The damn money-grubbing Yankees.

978
01:19:40,693 --> 01:19:43,127
I mean, those damn fools,
they don't get the message.

979
01:19:43,293 --> 01:19:45,682
Always the darkies.
Nothing but the darkies.

980
01:19:45,773 --> 01:19:46,808
You know, Jim....

981
01:19:47,213 --> 01:19:49,283
Sit down. I think that my idea...

982
01:19:49,373 --> 01:19:54,242
my analogy of a gentlemen's club
is fair enough. It's clear enough.

983
01:19:54,373 --> 01:19:55,772
Colonel, think on it now.

984
01:19:56,373 --> 01:19:59,092
Suppose that we all joined a club,
a gentlemen's club.

985
01:19:59,293 --> 01:20:02,888
After a time, several of the members
began to intrude themselves...

986
01:20:02,973 --> 01:20:05,203
into our private lives, our home lives.

987
01:20:05,533 --> 01:20:08,172
Began telling us
what we could and couldn't do.

988
01:20:08,253 --> 01:20:11,131
Well, then, wouldn't any one of us
have the right to resign?

989
01:20:11,453 --> 01:20:13,171
I mean, just resign.

990
01:20:14,133 --> 01:20:15,248
That's what we did.

991
01:20:15,453 --> 01:20:19,731
That's what I did and now these people
are telling us we don't have that right.

992
01:20:23,533 --> 01:20:25,046
I got to hand it to you.

993
01:20:25,693 --> 01:20:29,049
You certainly do have a talent
for trivializing the momentous...

994
01:20:29,173 --> 01:20:30,970
and complicating the obvious.

995
01:20:31,093 --> 01:20:33,288
Have you ever considered
running for Congress?

996
01:20:33,373 --> 01:20:35,284
No. It's a thought.

997
01:20:39,853 --> 01:20:41,650
What does Colonel Fremantle think?

998
01:20:42,333 --> 01:20:44,449
Will the British come in on our side?

999
01:20:44,733 --> 01:20:49,409
Hell, yeah. They'll come in
when we don't need them no more.

1000
01:20:49,933 --> 01:20:53,721
Like some damn bank lending you money
when you're no longer in debt.

1001
01:20:53,853 --> 01:20:56,162
-Look here, Mr. Speaker....
-George.

1002
01:21:00,413 --> 01:21:01,402
A word?

1003
01:21:03,173 --> 01:21:04,322
Goodnight, Colonel.

1004
01:21:05,213 --> 01:21:06,407
See you later.

1005
01:21:10,853 --> 01:21:14,641
In the next few days, I believe
we're going to have a hell of a fight here.

1006
01:21:14,973 --> 01:21:17,885
I want you to do everything necessary
to get your boys ready.

1007
01:21:18,093 --> 01:21:20,812
You can start bringing them up
by the first light.

1008
01:21:20,893 --> 01:21:23,123
I want you all in Gettysburg
by tomorrow night.

1009
01:21:23,293 --> 01:21:24,521
Yes, sir.

1010
01:21:50,733 --> 01:21:51,882
Good evening, John.

1011
01:21:52,533 --> 01:21:55,889
I'm surprised you could find headquarters
with all that confusion.

1012
01:21:57,373 --> 01:21:59,045
There's an old Indian saying:

1013
01:21:59,133 --> 01:22:01,931
"Follow the cigar smoke
and find a fat man there."

1014
01:22:23,333 --> 01:22:24,448
General Hancock.

1015
01:22:24,533 --> 01:22:25,761
How are you, John?

1016
01:22:25,933 --> 01:22:27,207
I'm all right.

1017
01:22:27,333 --> 01:22:30,689
But the brigades are pretty shot up.
I need to get refitted.

1018
01:22:31,333 --> 01:22:34,962
Right. I'll see to it.
We know what you did this morning.

1019
01:22:35,973 --> 01:22:38,851
-That was one hell of a piece of soldiering.
-Thank you, sir.

1020
01:22:40,493 --> 01:22:43,007
Heard you were with John Reynolds
when he was killed.

1021
01:22:43,773 --> 01:22:46,128
I'm sending the body up
to his folks in Lancaster.

1022
01:22:46,213 --> 01:22:48,090
They might appreciate a note from you.

1023
01:22:48,293 --> 01:22:49,282
I'll send it.

1024
01:22:51,053 --> 01:22:52,281
He was a soldier.

1025
01:22:53,893 --> 01:22:55,292
And a good friend.

1026
01:22:56,853 --> 01:23:00,812
Three of us, Reynolds,
Lo Armistead and I came up together.

1027
01:23:01,533 --> 01:23:02,727
Mexican War.

1028
01:23:04,093 --> 01:23:05,208
California.

1029
01:23:06,173 --> 01:23:07,322
We stayed close.

1030
01:23:09,093 --> 01:23:11,971
I wonder how old Lo is doing.
If he's still alive.

1031
01:23:13,493 --> 01:23:15,449
Heard he had one of Pickett's brigades.

1032
01:23:15,813 --> 01:23:17,007
Under Longstreet.

1033
01:23:26,533 --> 01:23:27,522
Remarkable.

1034
01:23:30,973 --> 01:23:32,372
Just across the ridge.

1035
01:23:36,453 --> 01:23:39,126
I'd like to see him again, but not here.
Not like this.

1036
01:23:40,973 --> 01:23:43,168
Well, maybe after the war.

1037
01:23:49,173 --> 01:23:50,970
Where do you want me in the morning?

1038
01:23:51,493 --> 01:23:53,927
I want you to hold your position
on the extreme left.

1039
01:23:54,013 --> 01:23:55,571
Get some rest if you can.

1040
01:23:56,013 --> 01:23:57,731
We may need you in the morning.

1041
01:23:57,973 --> 01:24:00,441
Jeb Stuart's still on the prowl
out there someplace.

1042
01:24:01,933 --> 01:24:02,922
Yes, sir.

1043
01:24:39,733 --> 01:24:41,166
Well, General Reynolds...

1044
01:24:43,813 --> 01:24:45,565
we held the high ground.

1045
01:25:02,053 --> 01:25:03,566
General Trimble is waiting.

1046
01:25:03,653 --> 01:25:05,405
-Will you see him now?
-Very well.

1047
01:25:05,493 --> 01:25:09,088
Major, I want a scouting party sent out
posthaste to find General Stuart.

1048
01:25:09,213 --> 01:25:11,408
-Yes, sir. Right away, sir.
-Thank you.

1049
01:25:25,253 --> 01:25:26,527
General Trimble.

1050
01:25:29,133 --> 01:25:32,762
Sir, I most respectfully request
another assignment.

1051
01:25:38,693 --> 01:25:40,365
Do please go on, General.

1052
01:25:40,933 --> 01:25:42,412
The man is a disgrace.

1053
01:25:43,093 --> 01:25:46,802
Sir, have you been listening at all
to what the aides have been telling you?

1054
01:25:47,053 --> 01:25:50,090
Ask General Gordon or General Ewell.
Ask them.

1055
01:25:51,853 --> 01:25:53,889
We could've taken that hill.

1056
01:25:54,053 --> 01:25:56,203
God in his wisdom knows
we should've taken it.

1057
01:25:56,293 --> 01:25:58,932
There was no one there at all
and it commanded the town.

1058
01:26:00,293 --> 01:26:03,046
General Gordon saw it.
I mean, he was with us.

1059
01:26:03,613 --> 01:26:06,207
Me and Ewell and Gordon...

1060
01:26:06,853 --> 01:26:11,165
all standing in the dark like idiots
with that bloody damned hill empty.

1061
01:26:13,907 --> 01:26:15,499
I beg your pardon, General.

1062
01:26:16,787 --> 01:26:20,097
That bloody damned hill was bare
as his bloody damned head!

1063
01:26:20,947 --> 01:26:23,177
We all saw it, as God is my witness.

1064
01:26:23,507 --> 01:26:24,781
We were all there.

1065
01:26:25,627 --> 01:26:29,745
I said to him, "General Ewell,
we have got to take that hill."

1066
01:26:30,547 --> 01:26:33,380
General Jackson wouldn't have stopped
with them on the run...

1067
01:26:33,467 --> 01:26:35,822
and plenty of light
on a hill like that empty.

1068
01:26:36,347 --> 01:26:37,746
God help us!

1069
01:26:39,067 --> 01:26:40,386
I don't know....

1070
01:26:40,547 --> 01:26:41,741
I don't know why....

1071
01:26:43,347 --> 01:26:44,826
Do please continue, General.

1072
01:26:46,387 --> 01:26:47,376
Yes, sir.

1073
01:26:49,587 --> 01:26:50,622
Sir.

1074
01:26:51,907 --> 01:26:54,057
I said to General Ewell these words....

1075
01:26:54,867 --> 01:26:56,141
I said to him:

1076
01:26:56,867 --> 01:27:01,099
"Sir, give me one division
and I will take that hill."

1077
01:27:02,387 --> 01:27:06,175
He said nothing.
He just stood there and stared at me.

1078
01:27:07,027 --> 01:27:10,178
I said, "General Ewell,
give me one brigade...

1079
01:27:10,827 --> 01:27:12,658
"and I will take that hill."

1080
01:27:14,067 --> 01:27:15,785
I was becoming disturbed, sir.

1081
01:27:16,507 --> 01:27:20,944
And General Ewell put his arms
behind him and blinked.

1082
01:27:21,587 --> 01:27:25,978
So I said,
"General, give me one regiment...

1083
01:27:26,227 --> 01:27:27,945
"and I will take that hill."

1084
01:27:29,387 --> 01:27:31,662
And he said nothing.

1085
01:27:32,067 --> 01:27:33,739
He just stood there.

1086
01:27:34,027 --> 01:27:37,258
I threw down my sword.
Down on the ground in front of him.

1087
01:27:46,587 --> 01:27:48,145
We could have done it, sir.

1088
01:27:49,067 --> 01:27:50,739
A blind man should have seen it.

1089
01:27:53,507 --> 01:27:55,020
Now they're working up there.

1090
01:27:56,147 --> 01:27:58,741
You can hear the axes
of the federal troops.

1091
01:27:59,507 --> 01:28:00,826
And so in the morning...

1092
01:28:01,067 --> 01:28:03,058
many a good boy will die...

1093
01:28:04,307 --> 01:28:05,820
taking that hill.

1094
01:28:08,267 --> 01:28:09,256
Sir.

1095
01:28:10,707 --> 01:28:12,937
I must request another assignment.

1096
01:28:21,307 --> 01:28:23,457
No, sir. That won't be necessary.

1097
01:28:25,227 --> 01:28:26,865
You will be of great service.

1098
01:28:27,667 --> 01:28:29,339
And I do thank you.

1099
01:29:18,307 --> 01:29:19,501
General Meade, sir.

1100
01:29:19,707 --> 01:29:23,256
Hancock. It's so damn dark out there
I can't see a thing.

1101
01:29:25,627 --> 01:29:26,742
Gentlemen.

1102
01:29:28,947 --> 01:29:30,539
I hope to God that this is...

1103
01:29:31,827 --> 01:29:33,055
good ground.

1104
01:29:36,147 --> 01:29:38,866
Is this good ground, General?

1105
01:29:40,307 --> 01:29:42,025
Is this a place to have an army?

1106
01:29:42,667 --> 01:29:45,579
Very good ground, sir.

1107
01:29:46,427 --> 01:29:47,826
I hope you are right.

1108
01:29:48,827 --> 01:29:52,024
Because we are going to have a fight here
sure enough in the morning.

1109
01:29:58,387 --> 01:30:01,106
-Will there be anything else, sir?
-No, thank you, Major.

1110
01:30:01,347 --> 01:30:02,336
Very well.

1111
01:30:30,827 --> 01:30:32,738
<i>In the morning is the great battle.</i>

1112
01:30:34,067 --> 01:30:37,343
<i>Tomorrow or the next day</i>
<i>will determine the war.</i>

1113
01:30:38,747 --> 01:30:40,305
<i>Virginia is here.</i>

1114
01:30:40,787 --> 01:30:42,379
<i>All the South is here.</i>

1115
01:30:43,387 --> 01:30:45,025
<i>What will you do tomorrow?</i>

1116
01:30:46,867 --> 01:30:48,266
<i>In the morning...</i>

1117
01:30:48,867 --> 01:30:52,143
<i>the enemy will be up</i>
<i>in fortified positions on high ground.</i>

1118
01:30:53,267 --> 01:30:55,622
<i>Longstreet's corps will be coming up...</i>

1119
01:30:56,147 --> 01:30:58,786
<i>and my boys will be ready</i>
<i>to finish the job.</i>

1120
01:30:59,747 --> 01:31:03,137
<i>If I tell them to withdraw now? No, sir.</i>

1121
01:31:04,067 --> 01:31:06,376
<i>They've been patient for far too long.</i>

1122
01:31:07,347 --> 01:31:09,736
<i>With the enemy out there up on the hill...</i>

1123
01:31:10,147 --> 01:31:12,377
<i>they'll be ready to finish the job.</i>

1124
01:31:13,267 --> 01:31:15,701
<i>But I don't even know</i>
<i>how much is up there.</i>

1125
01:31:16,187 --> 01:31:18,223
<i>How many men? How many cannon?</i>

1126
01:31:19,187 --> 01:31:21,621
<i>I don't know the ground on the flanks.</i>

1127
01:31:22,707 --> 01:31:23,822
<i>I don't know.</i>

1128
01:31:24,947 --> 01:31:27,415
<i>If I wait in the morning,</i>
<i>the early morning...</i>

1129
01:31:28,307 --> 01:31:31,026
<i>maybe Meade, under pressure, will attack.</i>

1130
01:31:32,347 --> 01:31:34,577
<i>That would make General Longstreet</i>
<i>very happy.</i>

1131
01:31:36,347 --> 01:31:39,020
<i>But I don't think Meade will come down.</i>

1132
01:31:39,547 --> 01:31:43,904
<i>And I don't think I can withdraw, so...</i>

1133
01:31:45,667 --> 01:31:48,625
<i>God's will, thy will be done.</i>

1134
01:31:51,107 --> 01:31:52,938
Major Sorrel, you've met before.

1135
01:31:53,267 --> 01:31:54,495
Thank you, General.

1136
01:31:55,507 --> 01:31:58,977
The federal position was scouted
during the last several hours.

1137
01:31:59,067 --> 01:32:00,580
We've drawn it up here.

1138
01:32:00,667 --> 01:32:02,146
Now this is the situation.

1139
01:32:02,587 --> 01:32:06,023
The position of the federal army
is in the shape of a fishhook.

1140
01:32:06,227 --> 01:32:08,343
It starts here. You see these two hills?

1141
01:32:08,507 --> 01:32:10,577
This one and the one with the cemetery.

1142
01:32:10,867 --> 01:32:13,256
That is where they have concentrated
their troops.

1143
01:32:13,747 --> 01:32:15,499
The hook starts there.

1144
01:32:16,347 --> 01:32:19,339
Now it curves around and comes down
this low ridge to the south.

1145
01:32:19,667 --> 01:32:22,340
Ending before two round hills
of high elevation.

1146
01:32:22,707 --> 01:32:25,301
The federals have no troops
on those two hills.

1147
01:32:26,027 --> 01:32:27,540
-Carry on, Major.
-Thank you.

1148
01:32:28,507 --> 01:32:32,386
We now know that General Hancock
is in charge of the Union center.

1149
01:32:32,667 --> 01:32:36,057
There are now perhaps 60,000
to 70,000 men already in position.

1150
01:32:36,147 --> 01:32:37,626
Perhaps as high as 90,000.

1151
01:32:42,107 --> 01:32:44,746
I spoke with General Ewell
of your suggestion...

1152
01:32:44,987 --> 01:32:47,865
that we move around to the right
to flank the federal army.

1153
01:32:48,627 --> 01:32:52,017
And he is of the opinion that
withdrawing from Gettysburg...

1154
01:32:52,107 --> 01:32:55,622
and giving it back to the enemy
would be very bad for morale.

1155
01:32:55,707 --> 01:32:58,540
It is unnecessary.
It might even be dangerous.

1156
01:32:58,747 --> 01:33:00,021
Do you disagree?

1157
01:33:02,387 --> 01:33:03,536
We must attack.

1158
01:33:05,187 --> 01:33:07,417
I would prefer not to fight
upon this ground...

1159
01:33:07,507 --> 01:33:10,738
but every moment we delay
the enemy uses to reinforce himself.

1160
01:33:11,147 --> 01:33:13,707
We cannot support ourselves for long
in this country.

1161
01:33:14,107 --> 01:33:16,985
We must not allow the federal army
to move around behind...

1162
01:33:17,107 --> 01:33:18,984
and cut us off from home. No, sir.

1163
01:33:19,147 --> 01:33:20,978
We must strike him now.

1164
01:33:24,867 --> 01:33:27,222
We pushed him yesterday
and he will remember it.

1165
01:33:28,347 --> 01:33:32,898
The men are ready and they are eager.
I see no useful alternative.

1166
01:33:33,347 --> 01:33:34,336
Yes, sir.

1167
01:33:34,427 --> 01:33:35,701
Very well.

1168
01:33:37,627 --> 01:33:38,616
Gentlemen.

1169
01:33:39,947 --> 01:33:42,017
-Good morning, all.
-Good morning, sir.

1170
01:33:42,667 --> 01:33:46,103
Longstreet will attack on the right
with the First Corps.

1171
01:33:47,227 --> 01:33:48,421
Hill will support...

1172
01:33:49,267 --> 01:33:50,620
with Heth in reserve.

1173
01:33:52,427 --> 01:33:55,464
Ewell's people on the left
will demonstrate to keep the enemy...

1174
01:33:55,547 --> 01:33:57,822
from reinforcing against our right flank.

1175
01:33:57,907 --> 01:33:59,977
Yes, sir. But I still don't have Pickett.

1176
01:34:00,307 --> 01:34:02,582
He's at the rear of column,
a full day's march.

1177
01:34:02,787 --> 01:34:04,505
All I've got is Hood and McLaws.

1178
01:34:05,307 --> 01:34:09,141
I do believe that Hood's
and McLaws' divisions will be sufficient.

1179
01:34:10,147 --> 01:34:12,615
-With the General's permission.
-General Hood?

1180
01:34:13,507 --> 01:34:17,546
Moving in front of those rocky heights,
we'll have enfilade fire...

1181
01:34:17,627 --> 01:34:18,821
coming down on us.

1182
01:34:18,907 --> 01:34:21,057
Perhaps, but not for long. Your division...

1183
01:34:21,147 --> 01:34:24,423
will be up over this unoccupied hill,
the little, rocky one.

1184
01:34:24,507 --> 01:34:26,623
From there you will threaten
the enemy flank.

1185
01:34:26,707 --> 01:34:29,904
When you're heavily engaged,
General Ewell will strike from the left.

1186
01:34:30,147 --> 01:34:31,136
Very well, sir.

1187
01:34:32,667 --> 01:34:34,498
-General?
-Let's move out, gentlemen.

1188
01:34:40,747 --> 01:34:43,261
General Barksdale,
is Mississippi ready for this day?

1189
01:34:43,347 --> 01:34:45,019
-Mississippi is ready.
-Very well.

1190
01:34:45,547 --> 01:34:46,980
Let's go to it, Sam.

1191
01:34:50,747 --> 01:34:52,499
If he's right, General Lee...

1192
01:34:53,467 --> 01:34:55,298
then the war is over by sundown.

1193
01:34:57,147 --> 01:34:58,136
We'll see.

1194
01:34:59,027 --> 01:35:01,222
I don't like going in without Pickett.

1195
01:35:01,307 --> 01:35:03,457
It's like going in with one boot off.

1196
01:35:03,987 --> 01:35:05,739
I'll wait as long as I can.

1197
01:35:07,387 --> 01:35:09,139
Do you have any idea of the force?

1198
01:35:10,827 --> 01:35:15,059
We counted five corps, including
the two involved in yesterday's action.

1199
01:35:15,547 --> 01:35:17,458
That don't mean how many might be...

1200
01:35:17,547 --> 01:35:19,538
hidden behind those hills there.

1201
01:35:20,507 --> 01:35:23,897
And, damn it, with Stuart gone
there ain't no way of knowing for sure.

1202
01:35:26,667 --> 01:35:28,976
Take good care of yourself today,
you hear?

1203
01:35:30,147 --> 01:35:31,136
You, too, Pete.

1204
01:35:41,827 --> 01:35:43,226
With your permission, sir.

1205
01:35:55,427 --> 01:35:57,304
I don't believe I've had the pleasure.

1206
01:35:58,547 --> 01:36:01,903
That's Major General John Bell Hood,
but we call him Sam.

1207
01:36:02,107 --> 01:36:06,100
One of my three division commanders.
Fellows from Texas and Alabama.

1208
01:36:06,427 --> 01:36:08,987
You've been to Texas, as I recall.

1209
01:36:09,227 --> 01:36:11,661
Yes. Actually that's where I came through.

1210
01:36:12,267 --> 01:36:15,657
Courtesy of the Yankee Navy
who denied me any other point of entry.

1211
01:36:17,867 --> 01:36:20,017
It's a marvelous place, Texas.

1212
01:36:20,427 --> 01:36:23,100
Full of red Indians and Mexicans...

1213
01:36:23,187 --> 01:36:25,906
cowboys, bandits and desperados.

1214
01:36:27,147 --> 01:36:29,422
Even hotter and more humid
than this place.

1215
01:36:30,147 --> 01:36:31,899
If that's possible.

1216
01:36:32,667 --> 01:36:33,782
That fellow Hood...

1217
01:36:34,107 --> 01:36:36,905
does his performance in battle
match his appearance?

1218
01:36:36,987 --> 01:36:38,739
He really does look the part.

1219
01:36:39,467 --> 01:36:40,661
He does his job.

1220
01:36:42,027 --> 01:36:43,858
Most interesting army, I must say.

1221
01:36:44,987 --> 01:36:48,297
Virginia gentlemen fighting
alongside Texas frontiersmen...

1222
01:36:49,027 --> 01:36:51,666
and bayou bushwhackers from Louisiana.

1223
01:36:52,227 --> 01:36:54,457
Drawn together from across a continent.

1224
01:36:55,987 --> 01:36:59,502
Having traveled a good piece of it myself,
I feel a part...

1225
01:36:59,707 --> 01:37:02,585
or almost a member of this enterprise.

1226
01:37:03,987 --> 01:37:08,026
You call yourselves Americans,
but you're really transplanted Englishmen.

1227
01:37:08,547 --> 01:37:11,505
Look at your names, Lee, Hood...

1228
01:37:11,627 --> 01:37:13,857
Longstreet, Jackson, Stuart.

1229
01:37:13,947 --> 01:37:15,141
My people were Dutch.

1230
01:37:15,227 --> 01:37:19,300
And the same for your adversaries.
Meade, Hooker, Hancock, and...

1231
01:37:20,507 --> 01:37:23,305
shall I say? Lincoln.

1232
01:37:25,707 --> 01:37:30,178
The same God. Same language.
Same culture and history.

1233
01:37:30,267 --> 01:37:34,579
The same songs, stories, legends, myths.

1234
01:37:35,707 --> 01:37:37,026
But different dreams.

1235
01:37:38,507 --> 01:37:39,781
Different dreams.

1236
01:37:41,467 --> 01:37:43,822
It's so very sad. Very sad.

1237
01:37:44,667 --> 01:37:47,101
You English had your own civil war once,
didn't you?

1238
01:37:48,227 --> 01:37:50,457
That was ages ago.
We wouldn't dream of it now.

1239
01:37:51,227 --> 01:37:52,945
Cavaliers and Roundheads.

1240
01:37:53,227 --> 01:37:55,138
"Off with his head! "

1241
01:37:56,867 --> 01:37:58,141
Heads lying everywhere.

1242
01:37:58,387 --> 01:38:01,459
One could hardly take a step
without tripping over a fallen crown.

1243
01:38:01,707 --> 01:38:03,504
We're much more civilized now.

1244
01:38:03,587 --> 01:38:05,145
I assure you.

1245
01:38:06,107 --> 01:38:08,462
We have so much in common,
your country and mine.

1246
01:38:08,947 --> 01:38:11,825
I earnestly hope
that we shall become allies.

1247
01:38:12,627 --> 01:38:16,506
Your government would never ally itself
with a Confederacy...

1248
01:38:16,707 --> 01:38:19,779
that had the institution of slavery.
You know that. So do I.

1249
01:38:27,067 --> 01:38:30,184
We should have freed the slaves,
then fired on Fort Sumter.

1250
01:38:34,547 --> 01:38:38,984
I guess we Southerners and you English
have at least one thing in common.

1251
01:38:39,747 --> 01:38:42,580
We'd rather lose the war
than admit to the mistake.

1252
01:38:44,307 --> 01:38:46,901
We whupped you British twice
as I recollect.

1253
01:38:49,307 --> 01:38:52,458
Your candor is admirable,
if somewhat eccentric.

1254
01:38:53,547 --> 01:38:55,822
A little eccentricity is good for a general.

1255
01:38:56,467 --> 01:39:00,016
We Southerners like our men religious
and a little bit mad.

1256
01:39:01,347 --> 01:39:04,100
I suspect that's why the women
fall in love with preachers.

1257
01:39:46,267 --> 01:39:49,304
<i>In nomine pater, et filii, et spiritus sancti.</i>

1258
01:39:49,987 --> 01:39:50,976
Amen.

1259
01:39:51,587 --> 01:39:52,986
General Longstreet.

1260
01:39:54,227 --> 01:39:56,104
Do you mind if I accompany you?

1261
01:39:56,187 --> 01:39:58,747
Not at all. I'm very glad
to have you with us, sir.

1262
01:40:00,427 --> 01:40:02,304
The heat reminds me of Mexico.

1263
01:40:02,987 --> 01:40:04,864
Yes, but there it was very dry.

1264
01:40:05,827 --> 01:40:07,340
That was a good outfit.

1265
01:40:08,307 --> 01:40:12,095
I remember storming the ramparts
of Chapultapec with old George Pickett.

1266
01:40:13,147 --> 01:40:16,935
Reynolds.... My old friend,
Ulysses Sam Grant.

1267
01:40:17,107 --> 01:40:19,826
-There was some good men in that army.
-Yes, indeed.

1268
01:40:19,907 --> 01:40:23,217
Some of those men are waiting for us now
up ahead on those ridges.

1269
01:40:25,147 --> 01:40:28,344
I don't know. I sometimes feel troubled.

1270
01:40:29,547 --> 01:40:32,698
Those fellows, those boys in blue,
they never quite seem the enemy.

1271
01:40:33,267 --> 01:40:34,256
I know.

1272
01:40:35,507 --> 01:40:38,544
I used to command some of those boys.
Swore an oath, too.

1273
01:40:41,467 --> 01:40:44,664
I couldn't fight against Georgia
and South Carolina.

1274
01:40:45,747 --> 01:40:47,146
Not against my own family.

1275
01:40:47,227 --> 01:40:50,264
No, sir. There was always a higher duty
to Virginia.

1276
01:40:50,987 --> 01:40:52,340
That was our first duty.

1277
01:40:52,427 --> 01:40:54,657
There was never any question about that.

1278
01:40:54,747 --> 01:40:56,977
-I guess so.
-Let us not think about that now.

1279
01:40:57,627 --> 01:40:59,458
The issue is in God's hands.

1280
01:40:59,787 --> 01:41:01,140
We can only do our duty.

1281
01:41:02,907 --> 01:41:03,942
General?

1282
01:41:05,027 --> 01:41:07,177
Soldiering has one great trap.

1283
01:41:08,227 --> 01:41:10,661
To be a good soldier
you must love the army.

1284
01:41:11,227 --> 01:41:14,663
To be a good commander,
you must be willing to order the death...

1285
01:41:14,747 --> 01:41:16,146
of the thing you love.

1286
01:41:16,907 --> 01:41:19,375
We do not fear our own death, you and I.

1287
01:41:19,627 --> 01:41:21,538
But there comes a time....

1288
01:41:22,707 --> 01:41:25,301
We are never quite prepared
for so many to die.

1289
01:41:25,827 --> 01:41:30,139
We do expect the occasional empty chair.
A salute to fallen comrades...

1290
01:41:31,347 --> 01:41:33,815
but this war goes on and on
and the men die...

1291
01:41:33,907 --> 01:41:35,625
and the price gets ever higher.

1292
01:41:36,547 --> 01:41:41,302
We are prepared to lose some of us,
but we are never prepared to lose all of us.

1293
01:41:41,987 --> 01:41:44,023
And there is the great trap, General.

1294
01:41:44,667 --> 01:41:46,737
When you attack,
you must hold nothing back.

1295
01:41:46,827 --> 01:41:48,738
You must commit yourself totally.

1296
01:41:48,947 --> 01:41:51,700
We are adrift here in a sea of blood,
and I want it to end.

1297
01:41:54,307 --> 01:41:56,184
I want this to be the final battle.

1298
01:42:02,507 --> 01:42:05,738
I woke up this morning and I half thought
he'd be gone, George Meade.

1299
01:42:06,267 --> 01:42:08,656
That he would not want to fight here.
Yes, sir.

1300
01:42:09,307 --> 01:42:11,821
I woke up and I thought,
"Meade will be gone...

1301
01:42:11,907 --> 01:42:14,580
"and this war will go on and on and on."

1302
01:42:17,787 --> 01:42:19,379
We'll make him sorry he stayed.

1303
01:42:23,267 --> 01:42:24,666
God go with you, General.

1304
01:42:24,787 --> 01:42:26,106
And with you, General.

1305
01:42:34,307 --> 01:42:35,786
That's mostly to the south.

1306
01:42:35,867 --> 01:42:39,701
I thought the rebs were all in Gettysburg.
You don't suppose they're flanking again?

1307
01:42:39,867 --> 01:42:42,620
Mama's favorite. Let's go.

1308
01:42:42,827 --> 01:42:44,704
Lawrence, what's happening?

1309
01:42:44,867 --> 01:42:47,665
Sir, Corporal Estabrook reporting back, sir.

1310
01:42:47,747 --> 01:42:50,545
-Brook, I thought you were on sick call.
-Yes, sir.

1311
01:42:50,627 --> 01:42:51,662
How are you now?

1312
01:42:51,747 --> 01:42:53,783
It's my stomach.
I've been throwing up, sir.

1313
01:42:53,867 --> 01:42:55,186
It's something you ate.

1314
01:42:55,307 --> 01:42:57,821
-Finish up. We're about to move out.
-Yes, sir.

1315
01:42:59,347 --> 01:43:01,463
-Colonel Chamberlain.
-Colonel Vincent.

1316
01:43:01,547 --> 01:43:04,107
Form your men.
Follow me and prepare to double-quick.

1317
01:43:04,187 --> 01:43:06,496
We're going to the top of that hill,
right there.

1318
01:43:06,667 --> 01:43:08,737
-You hear that?
-Yes, sir. I'll set it up.

1319
01:43:08,827 --> 01:43:11,136
The rebels are stacking up
on our left flank.

1320
01:43:11,227 --> 01:43:12,740
And we've got to follow them.

1321
01:43:12,867 --> 01:43:14,300
-Make haste.
-Yes, sir.

1322
01:43:14,827 --> 01:43:16,101
Sound the assembly!

1323
01:43:18,467 --> 01:43:19,456
Follow me.

1324
01:43:24,707 --> 01:43:26,459
Powder in! Load!

1325
01:43:35,267 --> 01:43:36,256
General.

1326
01:43:37,827 --> 01:43:41,263
Look here,
the ground is strewn with boulders.

1327
01:43:41,867 --> 01:43:44,540
The soldiers up there are entrenched
all over the ground.

1328
01:43:44,667 --> 01:43:46,305
And there are guns in the rocks.

1329
01:43:46,947 --> 01:43:49,097
Every move I make is observed.

1330
01:43:50,787 --> 01:43:54,097
If I attack as ordered,
I lose half my division.

1331
01:43:54,827 --> 01:43:58,581
And they'll be looking down our throats
at us from that hill right there.

1332
01:43:59,667 --> 01:44:01,862
We must move around to the right, sir.

1333
01:44:02,307 --> 01:44:03,740
And take them from the rear.

1334
01:44:04,947 --> 01:44:08,906
The commanding general will not allow
a flanking movement around those hills.

1335
01:44:09,787 --> 01:44:11,982
I argued it yesterday.
I argued it all morning.

1336
01:44:12,067 --> 01:44:14,456
I've been arguing against any attack at all.

1337
01:44:14,627 --> 01:44:16,902
I can't call this one off. You know it.

1338
01:44:18,147 --> 01:44:20,900
Let me move up the big round hill
to the south.

1339
01:44:21,107 --> 01:44:23,701
Nobody is on that.
If I could get a battery up there....

1340
01:44:23,787 --> 01:44:25,140
There ain't enough time.

1341
01:44:25,387 --> 01:44:27,776
You'd have to cut down trees
to place your artillery.

1342
01:44:27,867 --> 01:44:29,937
It would be dark before you were in action.

1343
01:44:30,947 --> 01:44:33,745
One the other hand,
if they get batteries up there...

1344
01:44:33,827 --> 01:44:37,058
we'll need buckets to catch the lead.
You've got to take that hill.

1345
01:44:37,747 --> 01:44:40,261
They don't even need guns to defend that.

1346
01:44:40,347 --> 01:44:42,577
All they need to do
is roll rocks down on you.

1347
01:44:42,867 --> 01:44:44,220
Just take it.

1348
01:44:44,307 --> 01:44:45,296
General.

1349
01:44:45,387 --> 01:44:47,264
I do this under protest.

1350
01:44:47,627 --> 01:44:49,299
Sam, you are the best I got.

1351
01:44:50,227 --> 01:44:52,946
Now, sir, if you are ready,
why don't you take that hill?

1352
01:45:10,467 --> 01:45:11,946
They're overshooting again.

1353
01:45:12,147 --> 01:45:15,184
Hey, fellows, you notice how
that reb artillery always overshoots?

1354
01:45:16,227 --> 01:45:17,342
-Tom?
-Yes, sir.

1355
01:45:17,827 --> 01:45:20,625
Another one a bit closer
and it could be hard day for Mother.

1356
01:45:20,707 --> 01:45:22,857
Go back to the rear.
Watch out for stragglers.

1357
01:45:22,947 --> 01:45:24,460
Keep your distance from me.

1358
01:45:25,307 --> 01:45:26,786
Lawrence, I don't....

1359
01:46:07,427 --> 01:46:09,383
The whole damn reb army is down there...

1360
01:46:09,827 --> 01:46:13,263
and coming up around our flanks.
They could be here any minute.

1361
01:46:13,627 --> 01:46:16,744
We've got to hold this place.
We've got to hold it.

1362
01:46:19,147 --> 01:46:21,502
Well, all right. I place you here.

1363
01:46:21,787 --> 01:46:25,336
Put your colors here, and set
your regiment to the left of this line.

1364
01:46:25,627 --> 01:46:28,699
The rest of the brigade
will form on your right. Understood?

1365
01:46:28,787 --> 01:46:30,778
-Yes. Ellis, this is the point.
-Sir.

1366
01:46:31,027 --> 01:46:33,143
Your regiment is to the left of this point.

1367
01:46:33,747 --> 01:46:36,659
-Colonel, sir. You're the end of the line.
-Yes.

1368
01:46:37,667 --> 01:46:41,216
You're the extreme left of the Union army.
Understood?

1369
01:46:42,227 --> 01:46:44,536
The line runs from here
back to Cemetery Hill...

1370
01:46:44,827 --> 01:46:46,897
-but it ends here.
-Understood.

1371
01:46:47,427 --> 01:46:49,383
You can't withdraw under any condition.

1372
01:46:50,907 --> 01:46:52,738
If you go, this line will be flanked.

1373
01:46:53,427 --> 01:46:56,021
If you go, the enemy will sweep up
over the hillside...

1374
01:46:56,107 --> 01:46:58,177
and take this entire army from the rear.

1375
01:46:59,667 --> 01:47:02,056
-You must defend this place to the last.
-Yes, sir.

1376
01:47:04,667 --> 01:47:06,623
Now we'll see how professors fight.

1377
01:47:08,587 --> 01:47:11,306
Ellis, position the regiment.
All company commanders here.

1378
01:47:11,387 --> 01:47:12,376
Yes, sir.

1379
01:47:12,547 --> 01:47:13,980
Sharpshooters to the left!

1380
01:47:15,027 --> 01:47:17,143
Battalion on the right!

1381
01:47:17,227 --> 01:47:19,457
Now file into line. March.

1382
01:47:26,867 --> 01:47:28,619
Bugler, sound the officer's call.

1383
01:47:35,147 --> 01:47:38,378
<i>"Hold to the last. " To the last what?</i>

1384
01:47:39,907 --> 01:47:41,545
<i>Exercise in rhetoric.</i>

1385
01:47:42,107 --> 01:47:44,701
<i>Last shell? Last man?</i>

1386
01:47:45,067 --> 01:47:47,900
<i>Last foot of ground? Last reb?</i>

1387
01:48:00,187 --> 01:48:01,176
Advance!

1388
01:48:02,947 --> 01:48:03,936
Move out!

1389
01:48:43,587 --> 01:48:45,418
Turn those guns around!

1390
01:48:50,707 --> 01:48:53,665
The 83rd Pennsylvania, 44th New York,
and 16th Michigan...

1391
01:48:53,867 --> 01:48:57,177
will be moving in to our right.
But if you look left, you will see...

1392
01:48:57,267 --> 01:48:58,939
that there is no one there.

1393
01:48:59,227 --> 01:49:02,299
Because we're the end of the line.
The Union army stops here.

1394
01:49:02,387 --> 01:49:03,581
We are the flank.

1395
01:49:04,627 --> 01:49:06,219
Do you understand, gentlemen?

1396
01:49:06,307 --> 01:49:09,105
We cannot retreat. We cannot withdraw.

1397
01:49:09,347 --> 01:49:12,066
We are going to have
to be stubborn today.

1398
01:49:13,987 --> 01:49:16,296
Put the boys in position,
tell them to stay down.

1399
01:49:16,387 --> 01:49:19,185
Pile the rocks up high
for the best protection you can.

1400
01:49:19,427 --> 01:49:21,702
I want the reserve pulled back
about 20 yards.

1401
01:49:21,827 --> 01:49:23,579
Sloping ground is good ground.

1402
01:49:23,667 --> 01:49:26,704
If you have any breakthroughs,
men wounded, a hole in the line...

1403
01:49:26,787 --> 01:49:29,301
plug it with the reserve.
How's our ammunition?

1404
01:49:29,387 --> 01:49:31,423
Sir, I think about 60 rounds per man.

1405
01:49:31,547 --> 01:49:34,539
That's good. 60 rounds. I think....
Yes, that's adequate.

1406
01:49:34,627 --> 01:49:35,662
Any questions?

1407
01:49:35,747 --> 01:49:36,736
Colonel.

1408
01:49:36,827 --> 01:49:39,944
It seems to me
the fighting is on that side of the hill.

1409
01:49:40,227 --> 01:49:42,297
It seems to me that we're the back door.

1410
01:49:42,387 --> 01:49:45,060
And everything's going on
at the front door.

1411
01:49:46,747 --> 01:49:50,422
That hill is steep and rocky. It's bare.
To come straight up it is impossible.

1412
01:49:50,787 --> 01:49:52,778
The reb army is going to swing around it.

1413
01:49:52,867 --> 01:49:56,018
It'll come up through that notch
right over there.

1414
01:49:56,107 --> 01:49:59,497
It'll move under the cover of trees,
trying to get around the flank.

1415
01:50:01,067 --> 01:50:02,295
And gentlemen...

1416
01:50:03,267 --> 01:50:04,666
we are the flank.

1417
01:50:07,347 --> 01:50:08,382
Gentlemen.

1418
01:50:16,547 --> 01:50:17,821
God go with you.

1419
01:50:42,987 --> 01:50:45,740
Captain Clark,
take the right side from the 83rd...

1420
01:50:45,827 --> 01:50:47,783
over in this direction to the center.

1421
01:50:47,867 --> 01:50:51,018
Ellis, take the left but be watchful.
Your flank will be in the air.

1422
01:50:53,987 --> 01:50:56,262
-Colonel, sir.
-Corporal Estabrook?

1423
01:50:56,347 --> 01:51:00,226
What do I do with these prisoners?
The hardheads of the Second Maine.

1424
01:51:03,987 --> 01:51:05,545
Do any of you care to join us?

1425
01:51:06,347 --> 01:51:08,986
-The rebs really coming?
-They're really coming.

1426
01:51:09,747 --> 01:51:12,784
Well, it's kind of dull
just sitting here watching, sir.

1427
01:51:13,027 --> 01:51:15,700
For any man who joins us,
there will be no court martial.

1428
01:51:21,987 --> 01:51:23,579
No man will call me a coward.

1429
01:51:29,307 --> 01:51:30,296
Why not?

1430
01:51:36,187 --> 01:51:39,657
I'll waste no man to guard you.
I expect you to be here when this is over.

1431
01:51:39,747 --> 01:51:42,944
-Let's get these fellows some muskets.
-There are no muskets, sir.

1432
01:51:45,987 --> 01:51:47,340
Wait here for a bit.

1433
01:51:47,427 --> 01:51:49,657
There will be guns available
in a little while.

1434
01:51:53,827 --> 01:51:56,500
That's the New York boys.
The rebs must be getting closer.

1435
01:51:56,587 --> 01:51:57,986
Must be moving this way.

1436
01:51:59,907 --> 01:52:01,579
Private Foss is praying.

1437
01:52:05,907 --> 01:52:08,580
-Will you put in a kind word for me?
-Yes, sir.

1438
01:52:15,747 --> 01:52:17,977
-You're the Merrill brothers, right?
-Yes, sir.

1439
01:52:18,067 --> 01:52:19,864
Boys, why aren't you on the ground?

1440
01:52:19,947 --> 01:52:22,381
Sir, I can't shoot worth a darn lying down.

1441
01:52:22,467 --> 01:52:25,584
Never could. Bill neither.
We like to fight standing.

1442
01:52:25,667 --> 01:52:27,498
I suggest you find a thicker tree.

1443
01:52:27,627 --> 01:52:28,616
Here they come!

1444
01:52:33,387 --> 01:52:36,106
I want you to stay with me,
but you keep down.

1445
01:52:36,307 --> 01:52:37,342
Buster!

1446
01:52:38,227 --> 01:52:40,536
I bet the whole damn reb army
is coming this way.

1447
01:52:40,707 --> 01:52:43,267
Walk down the line.
Tell the boys to get good cover.

1448
01:52:43,347 --> 01:52:45,542
Pile the rocks high and fire carefully.

1449
01:52:45,627 --> 01:52:47,504
-Go down and come back.
-Right.

1450
01:52:47,627 --> 01:52:49,219
You got to keep an eye on them.

1451
01:52:49,347 --> 01:52:52,339
Some of them load but never fire.
They just keep right on loading.

1452
01:52:52,427 --> 01:52:54,941
Some come home with
eight bullets rammed up the barrel.

1453
01:52:55,027 --> 01:52:56,426
Never fired a shot.

1454
01:52:58,907 --> 01:52:59,896
Sir.

1455
01:53:04,267 --> 01:53:05,620
Fire!

1456
01:53:56,747 --> 01:53:58,658
Keep up your fire, boys!

1457
01:54:03,587 --> 01:54:04,736
Keep your head down.

1458
01:54:05,267 --> 01:54:06,700
Watch your left side.

1459
01:54:14,147 --> 01:54:15,739
Keep up your fire!

1460
01:55:10,947 --> 01:55:12,505
They're falling back.

1461
01:55:12,587 --> 01:55:14,305
They'll be back in a minute.

1462
01:55:14,387 --> 01:55:16,457
-How are we doing?
-We're doing fine.

1463
01:55:17,627 --> 01:55:19,504
-Colonel.
-Captain Clark, anybody hurt?

1464
01:55:19,587 --> 01:55:22,055
-Head and shoulder wounds.
-They didn't hit the left.

1465
01:55:22,147 --> 01:55:24,741
They're moving out that way.
Can you see them, sir?

1466
01:55:24,827 --> 01:55:27,022
They're coming again, boys!

1467
01:56:38,987 --> 01:56:41,217
Colonel, look here.

1468
01:56:41,547 --> 01:56:44,425
A new regiment has arrived
that's moving against the left.

1469
01:56:44,507 --> 01:56:46,179
It's out there. Do you see them?

1470
01:56:46,747 --> 01:56:48,465
Double-quick!

1471
01:56:49,387 --> 01:56:52,026
I don't think we'll be able
to hold another one.

1472
01:56:52,107 --> 01:56:54,701
-Get all company commanders up here.
-On the double.

1473
01:56:56,787 --> 01:56:59,301
-Sergeant Owen!
-Yes, sir.

1474
01:57:00,147 --> 01:57:03,537
Get up to the top of that hill
and report me the situation from up there.

1475
01:57:03,667 --> 01:57:04,656
Yes, sir.

1476
01:57:21,827 --> 01:57:24,136
We're about to be flanked.
Here's what we'll do.

1477
01:57:25,027 --> 01:57:27,177
I want you to keep up
a good hot masking fire.

1478
01:57:27,427 --> 01:57:30,385
Keep a tight hold on the 83rd,
on old Pennsylvania over there.

1479
01:57:31,987 --> 01:57:33,545
I want no break in the line.

1480
01:57:33,707 --> 01:57:36,426
Captain Clark, that's you.
You understand? No breaks.

1481
01:57:37,267 --> 01:57:39,622
Right wing will sidestep to the left...

1482
01:57:40,507 --> 01:57:42,657
thinning out to twice the present distance.

1483
01:57:42,747 --> 01:57:45,705
You see the colors?
They will end up down to the extreme left.

1484
01:57:46,267 --> 01:57:49,816
When you reach that point,
we are going to refuse the line.

1485
01:57:50,747 --> 01:57:51,736
Understand?

1486
01:57:51,827 --> 01:57:53,783
We'll form a new line at right angles.

1487
01:57:53,867 --> 01:57:56,097
We'll pull up as much of a reserve
as possible.

1488
01:57:56,187 --> 01:57:59,145
We've got to be able to counter-attack
whenever there's a hole.

1489
01:57:59,227 --> 01:58:00,785
-Any questions?
-No, sir.

1490
01:58:01,067 --> 01:58:02,386
Fine. Move!

1491
01:58:03,627 --> 01:58:05,857
Lieutenant. You fellows, on the double.

1492
01:58:17,987 --> 01:58:18,976
Come on!

1493
01:59:00,907 --> 01:59:03,137
-How are you, Andrew?
-I'm fine, sir. And you?

1494
01:59:03,307 --> 01:59:04,342
A bit worn.

1495
01:59:04,947 --> 01:59:08,576
-The boys are putting up a hell of a fight.
-They are indeed.

1496
02:00:14,787 --> 02:00:16,857
I got me one. I got me a reb.

1497
02:00:18,067 --> 02:00:19,546
Buster! Are you all right?

1498
02:00:19,627 --> 02:00:22,699
I'll be fine in a minute,
but plays hell with me target practice.

1499
02:00:22,827 --> 02:00:24,226
The surgeon will see to it.

1500
02:00:24,307 --> 02:00:26,582
No. A little bandage is all I'll be needing.

1501
02:00:26,707 --> 02:00:29,141
A few minutes off my feet.
Me brogans are killing me.

1502
02:00:29,227 --> 02:00:31,502
Colonel, my men are getting low
on ammunition.

1503
02:00:31,867 --> 02:00:34,256
Go over to the 83rd.
Ask them to send what they can.

1504
02:00:34,347 --> 02:00:37,862
Lieutenant, go get from the wounded
and from the others anything you can.

1505
02:00:37,987 --> 02:00:41,218
-Pick up what you can from anywhere.
-Here they come, sir!

1506
02:01:26,187 --> 02:01:28,826
Keep up the fire!
Fill your holes down here!

1507
02:02:08,787 --> 02:02:10,061
There they go!

1508
02:02:22,107 --> 02:02:23,460
I'll be damned.

1509
02:02:25,387 --> 02:02:28,345
They keep coming!
How long are they going to keep coming?

1510
02:02:29,107 --> 02:02:32,179
I don't have much left. I got two shots.
That's what I got.

1511
02:02:32,427 --> 02:02:35,499
They keep coming on the flanks.
They keep moving to the left more.

1512
02:02:36,107 --> 02:02:39,543
They can't send help from the 83rd.
They say they got their own troubles.

1513
02:02:39,627 --> 02:02:42,983
-Colonel, sir! We'd like to report.
-What?

1514
02:02:43,467 --> 02:02:44,866
Vincent is badly wounded.

1515
02:02:45,587 --> 02:02:47,896
He got hit a few minutes
after the fight started.

1516
02:02:47,987 --> 02:02:51,297
We've been reinforced at the top of the hill
by Weed's brigade up front.

1517
02:02:51,387 --> 02:02:53,457
This is what they tell me.
But Weed is dead.

1518
02:02:53,547 --> 02:02:56,061
So they moved Hazlett's
battery of artillery up there.

1519
02:02:56,147 --> 02:02:58,138
But Hazlett's dead. Far as I can tell--

1520
02:02:58,227 --> 02:03:00,218
Can you can get ammunition
from up there?

1521
02:03:00,307 --> 02:03:02,775
I don't know. It's a mess.
But they're holding good.

1522
02:03:02,867 --> 02:03:04,903
The rebs are having a hard time climbing.

1523
02:03:04,987 --> 02:03:07,262
-It's a steep hill.
-We'll need the ammunition.

1524
02:03:07,347 --> 02:03:09,702
Colonel, sir, the better of my men
are wounded.

1525
02:03:10,067 --> 02:03:13,184
If the rebs come up that hill any stronger,
we can't stop them.

1526
02:03:13,267 --> 02:03:15,701
Send out word to take ammunition
from the wounded.

1527
02:03:15,787 --> 02:03:18,062
-Make every round count. Go!
-Here they come again!

1528
02:03:19,907 --> 02:03:21,260
Ready, boys!

1529
02:03:41,827 --> 02:03:43,977
Come on, keep it coming! Keep it up, lads!

1530
02:04:21,707 --> 02:04:22,742
Pour it on, boys!

1531
02:04:33,147 --> 02:04:35,297
Keep at them ! Keep up your fire!

1532
02:04:51,827 --> 02:04:53,545
Here they come, boys!

1533
02:06:09,347 --> 02:06:10,860
Go plug that hole over there!

1534
02:07:08,867 --> 02:07:10,380
Sir, half my men are down.

1535
02:07:10,467 --> 02:07:12,901
Most of the rest are wounded.
The left is too thin.

1536
02:07:12,987 --> 02:07:14,784
-How is our ammunition?
-Almost gone.

1537
02:07:14,867 --> 02:07:18,780
Sir, we're running out.
We don't have much left to shoot with.

1538
02:07:18,867 --> 02:07:20,380
Some boys got nothing at all.

1539
02:07:20,627 --> 02:07:22,265
What do we do for ammunition?

1540
02:07:22,347 --> 02:07:25,066
My boys had to pick up reb muskets
and fired back with them.

1541
02:07:25,147 --> 02:07:27,422
-We ought to pull out.
-No, we can't do that.

1542
02:07:27,507 --> 02:07:29,179
We can't hold them again, sir.

1543
02:07:29,267 --> 02:07:32,225
If we don't, they go right over the hill
and the flank caves in.

1544
02:07:37,267 --> 02:07:38,302
Here they come.

1545
02:07:43,027 --> 02:07:45,495
We can't run away.
If we stay here, we can't shoot.

1546
02:07:45,587 --> 02:07:46,861
So let's fix bayonets.

1547
02:07:50,667 --> 02:07:52,817
We'll have the advantage
moving down the hill.

1548
02:07:55,267 --> 02:07:57,986
They must be tired if we are.
So fix bayonets.

1549
02:07:58,067 --> 02:08:00,422
Ellis, you take the left wing.
I'll take the right.

1550
02:08:00,507 --> 02:08:02,384
Right wheel forward, the whole regiment.

1551
02:08:02,467 --> 02:08:04,617
-You mean charge?
-Yes, but here's what we do.

1552
02:08:04,747 --> 02:08:06,863
We're going to charge
swinging down the hill.

1553
02:08:06,947 --> 02:08:09,097
Just like we pulled back to the left side...

1554
02:08:09,227 --> 02:08:11,263
we'll swing it down like a door.

1555
02:08:11,467 --> 02:08:14,698
We'll sweep them down the hill
as they come up. Understand?

1556
02:08:14,787 --> 02:08:16,823
-Does everybody understand?
-Yes, sir.

1557
02:08:16,907 --> 02:08:18,579
Ellis, take the left wing.

1558
02:08:18,667 --> 02:08:22,216
When I command, the whole regiment
goes forward swinging down to the right.

1559
02:08:22,747 --> 02:08:24,305
All right, sir. Fine.

1560
02:08:26,587 --> 02:08:27,656
Move.

1561
02:08:30,627 --> 02:08:31,980
Bayonets!

1562
02:08:56,067 --> 02:08:58,581
Come on! Let's go! Move!

1563
02:08:58,707 --> 02:09:00,299
Quickly, boys! Quickly!

1564
02:09:08,947 --> 02:09:10,221
Let's go!

1565
02:09:12,707 --> 02:09:13,981
Bayonets!

1566
02:09:22,227 --> 02:09:23,216
Draw!

1567
02:09:24,627 --> 02:09:25,696
Bayonets!

1568
02:09:28,387 --> 02:09:29,740
Left swing, right wheel.

1569
02:09:29,987 --> 02:09:31,181
Right wheel!

1570
02:09:32,467 --> 02:09:33,456
Charge!

1571
02:09:36,787 --> 02:09:37,981
Charge!

1572
02:09:55,667 --> 02:09:56,816
Go!

1573
02:11:09,747 --> 02:11:10,736
The pistol.

1574
02:11:11,987 --> 02:11:13,261
Your prisoner, sir.

1575
02:11:16,627 --> 02:11:17,616
Wait here.

1576
02:11:42,347 --> 02:11:45,578
By God, Colonel,
the boys are still advancing.

1577
02:11:46,027 --> 02:11:48,700
-You better stop them.
-They're on their way to Richmond.

1578
02:11:48,867 --> 02:11:51,301
-Richmond!
-They've done enough for today.

1579
02:11:51,747 --> 02:11:53,897
I want you to meet
this fellow from Alabama.

1580
02:11:54,187 --> 02:11:56,940
Captain Hawkins, this is my brother,
Colonel Chamberlain.

1581
02:11:58,587 --> 02:11:59,576
Sir.

1582
02:12:00,627 --> 02:12:02,060
May I have some water?

1583
02:12:02,387 --> 02:12:03,456
Yes.

1584
02:12:04,987 --> 02:12:06,864
Sure. Tom, get this man a canteen.

1585
02:12:07,227 --> 02:12:09,104
Yes, sir. Right this way.

1586
02:12:28,547 --> 02:12:29,741
How you doing?

1587
02:12:30,187 --> 02:12:31,176
Twice!

1588
02:12:31,987 --> 02:12:34,342
Would you believe, for the love of Mary?

1589
02:12:34,547 --> 02:12:35,536
Twice.

1590
02:12:41,547 --> 02:12:45,062
And how are you, Colonel, darling,
this fine day?

1591
02:12:47,347 --> 02:12:49,178
I got it in the armpit.

1592
02:12:49,987 --> 02:12:52,706
For the love of God, in the bloody armpit.

1593
02:12:53,587 --> 02:12:54,576
How is he?

1594
02:12:55,067 --> 02:12:56,056
It's an arm.

1595
02:12:56,147 --> 02:12:58,138
Only an arm. You got to lose something.

1596
02:12:58,827 --> 02:13:00,260
It might as well be an arm.

1597
02:13:00,347 --> 02:13:04,181
I can part with that easier than other
mechanics of nature, and that's the truth.

1598
02:13:09,707 --> 02:13:11,345
I could do with a nip right now.

1599
02:13:11,747 --> 02:13:13,305
I'll see what I can do.

1600
02:13:14,107 --> 02:13:15,665
You do pretty good.

1601
02:13:19,547 --> 02:13:21,583
Colonel....

1602
02:13:22,267 --> 02:13:24,303
I'm right here, Buster. I'm right here.

1603
02:13:27,507 --> 02:13:28,986
The army was blessed.

1604
02:13:32,107 --> 02:13:36,180
I want to tell you, just in case...

1605
02:13:38,947 --> 02:13:40,346
that I never served....

1606
02:13:45,947 --> 02:13:47,903
I've never served with a better man.

1607
02:13:54,387 --> 02:13:55,661
Don't worry, sir.

1608
02:13:56,187 --> 02:13:58,223
He'll make it. He's a tough old mick.

1609
02:14:32,787 --> 02:14:35,859
Colonel, sir. It would so honor me.

1610
02:14:46,107 --> 02:14:49,895
Colonel, sir. I've been moving these rebs
with an empty musket.

1611
02:14:51,067 --> 02:14:52,546
That's allowed.

1612
02:14:58,267 --> 02:15:00,542
You're ordered to go to the top
of the big hill.

1613
02:15:00,787 --> 02:15:03,540
-My New Yorkers will take your prisoners.
-Yes, sir.

1614
02:15:04,187 --> 02:15:05,939
We watched from our position above.

1615
02:15:06,467 --> 02:15:08,583
It's the damnedest thing I ever saw.

1616
02:15:10,067 --> 02:15:11,500
May I shake your hand, sir?

1617
02:15:14,467 --> 02:15:18,779
Colonel, one thing.
The name of this place, this hill....

1618
02:15:19,667 --> 02:15:21,146
Has it got a name, this hill?

1619
02:15:21,627 --> 02:15:25,142
This is Little Round Top.
That's the name of the hill you defended.

1620
02:15:25,227 --> 02:15:28,299
The big one you're going up to,
that's Big Round Top.

1621
02:15:29,787 --> 02:15:32,779
Is that so? I guess I'll remember that.

1622
02:15:42,627 --> 02:15:45,903
Ellis, move the men out.
I'm going to go ahead.

1623
02:16:04,547 --> 02:16:05,980
English
