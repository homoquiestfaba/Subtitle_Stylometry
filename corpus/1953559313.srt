1
00:01:13,006 --> 00:01:15,509
A tornado warning remains
in effect

2
00:01:15,575 --> 00:01:17,179
for northeastern Johnson County

3
00:01:17,243 --> 00:01:18,688
In east central Kansas

4
00:01:18,745 --> 00:01:20,725
and southwestern Jackson County

5
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:24,421
in west central
Missouri until 9:45 PM

6
00:01:24,484 --> 00:01:27,863
National Weather Service
Doppler radar indicated this danger

7
00:01:27,921 --> 00:01:30,367
Storm was located
seven miles...

8
00:01:30,423 --> 00:01:32,528
Ah! No!

9
00:01:32,592 --> 00:01:35,368
God, help! God!

10
00:02:51,771 --> 00:02:53,717
So is your mom home?

11
00:02:53,773 --> 00:02:56,549
No, she's at her weekly
hair appointment.

12
00:02:59,145 --> 00:03:01,523
You want to fool around?

13
00:03:02,715 --> 00:03:04,490
Do you ever think
I'm gonna say yes?

14
00:03:04,551 --> 00:03:05,791
Patience is a virtue

15
00:03:05,852 --> 00:03:07,559
Mmm.
Well, you got one

16
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:10,328
Seriously though, you want me
to wait till she gets home?

17
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:14,770
No, I want you to wait
until I finish this cigarette

18
00:03:14,827 --> 00:03:17,501
Remind me again
why I hang out with you

19
00:03:18,531 --> 00:03:21,842
Cause you want to sleep with me

20
00:03:23,570 --> 00:03:26,141
Oh yeah

21
00:03:26,206 --> 00:03:28,743
Thanks again for helping me
cut geometry today.

22
00:03:28,808 --> 00:03:31,618
Hey, I was leaving anyway

23
00:03:31,678 --> 00:03:35,387
Besides,
I'm going to be a porn star

24
00:03:35,448 --> 00:03:37,928
The fuck do I need geometry for?

25
00:03:37,984 --> 00:03:39,986
Thank you

26
00:03:40,053 --> 00:03:42,226
Hey, cheer up.
Your dad's coming home soon

27
00:03:42,288 --> 00:03:45,098
Yeah, maybe he'll buy me
a GTO just like your daddy

28
00:03:45,158 --> 00:03:47,866
Hey, I mowed a lot of yards
to get this car, okay?

29
00:03:50,296 --> 00:03:52,071
My dad's yard

30
00:03:52,131 --> 00:03:53,906
a lot of times.

31
00:03:58,504 --> 00:04:01,212
All right, see you Saturday

32
00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:06,119
So it's a date then?

33
00:04:06,179 --> 00:04:07,817
Bye, Sean

34
00:04:27,166 --> 00:04:30,579
I'm six-months sober as of tomorrow,

35
00:04:30,637 --> 00:04:32,139
as a matter of fact

36
00:04:32,205 --> 00:04:33,946
My wife's coming back to me

37
00:04:34,007 --> 00:04:36,453
Hmm.
I get to see my kids again

38
00:04:36,509 --> 00:04:38,546
I got you guys to all thank for that.

39
00:04:38,611 --> 00:04:40,056
Thank you

40
00:04:43,516 --> 00:04:45,154
Okay, I guess I'll go next

41
00:04:45,218 --> 00:04:47,528
Uh, my name is Janet
I'm an alcoholic

42
00:04:47,587 --> 00:04:49,533
and I've been sober
for four months.

43
00:04:49,589 --> 00:04:52,229
Hi, Janet

44
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:54,431
Well, I should be happy right now

45
00:04:54,494 --> 00:04:57,168
because my husband's coming home tonight.

46
00:04:57,230 --> 00:05:01,337
He's in the military. He's been fighting
overseas for the last year and a half.

47
00:05:01,401 --> 00:05:04,143
But to be totally honest,

48
00:05:04,203 --> 00:05:06,183
I don't feel happy

49
00:05:06,239 --> 00:05:08,845
I feel-- I feel really scared

50
00:05:08,908 --> 00:05:12,082
Like I've been thinking about
all the things that he's seen over there

51
00:05:12,145 --> 00:05:15,126
and everything
that he's lived through

52
00:05:15,181 --> 00:05:17,889
And then he's gonna
come home to...

53
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:19,861
me.

54
00:05:21,387 --> 00:05:24,857
I just thought that sobriety
was going to make things better

55
00:05:24,924 --> 00:05:27,530
You know? I thought that
if I could just stop drinking

56
00:05:27,593 --> 00:05:29,732
that things would improve

57
00:05:29,796 --> 00:05:31,742
But it hasn't been like that at all

58
00:05:31,798 --> 00:05:33,300
In fact I feel like every day

59
00:05:33,366 --> 00:05:35,710
everything's getting worse
at home, you know?

60
00:05:37,637 --> 00:05:42,143
I don't know, it's--
I've just been really selfish

61
00:05:43,476 --> 00:05:45,422
I guess that's why
I'm here, you know?

62
00:05:45,478 --> 00:05:47,685
I just-- I want to do better

63
00:05:47,747 --> 00:05:52,526
I want to-- I want to be better

64
00:05:52,585 --> 00:05:54,496
As these trained
weather spotters are continuing

65
00:05:54,554 --> 00:05:56,295
to feed us and give us
the new information,

66
00:05:56,356 --> 00:05:57,699
we'll make sure
to give you the updates

67
00:05:57,757 --> 00:05:59,464
Stay tuned.
We will keep you advised

68
00:05:59,525 --> 00:06:01,869
to this rapidly changing situation

69
00:06:01,928 --> 00:06:04,067
Good afternoon.The National Weather Service

70
00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:06,576
issued a tornado watch
earlier this morning

71
00:06:06,632 --> 00:06:10,239
and things are going
from showers to thunderstorms

72
00:06:10,303 --> 00:06:12,749
and getting a little more dangerous
across eastern Kansas.

73
00:06:12,805 --> 00:06:14,375
You can see over the last few hours,

74
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:16,283
starting to see those colors
brighten up--

75
00:06:16,342 --> 00:06:18,515
a lot more red on the screen
That is indicative

76
00:06:18,578 --> 00:06:20,057
of the storm strengthening.

77
00:06:20,113 --> 00:06:22,719
And really they're all converging
on eastern Kansas.

78
00:06:22,782 --> 00:06:25,194
Several warnings have been posted

79
00:06:25,251 --> 00:06:27,527
At this point, it is only
for hail and high winds.

80
00:06:27,587 --> 00:06:29,692
But certainly,
as the National Weather Service

81
00:06:29,756 --> 00:06:31,497
has issued that tornado warning

82
00:06:31,557 --> 00:06:34,265
there is the potential
for some tornadic activity

83
00:06:34,327 --> 00:06:36,273
as we progress throughout the day,

84
00:06:36,329 --> 00:06:39,401
as all of this travels across
the state and to the east.

85
00:06:39,465 --> 00:06:42,344
Areas west of l-35 look to be okay

86
00:06:42,402 --> 00:06:44,541
But areas east of l-35

87
00:06:58,050 --> 00:07:00,223
Girls, are you ready?

88
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:49,302
I thought you quit smoking

89
00:07:51,337 --> 00:07:53,476
Watch your face

90
00:07:55,975 --> 00:07:59,889
...a serious situation to a slightly
more dangerous situation as...

91
00:08:02,248 --> 00:08:03,989
You ready?

92
00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:06,929
No, I'm running away.
That's why I've packed a bag

93
00:08:08,688 --> 00:08:10,895
Why are we staying
in Kansas City tonight?

94
00:08:10,957 --> 00:08:13,369
Weather Channel says
there's going to be a storm

95
00:08:13,426 --> 00:08:16,669
If your father's flight is delayed,
we might have to stay in a hotel

96
00:08:16,729 --> 00:08:20,040
Then why don't we just stay here
tonight and go in the morning?

97
00:08:20,099 --> 00:08:22,705
Because I want us to be
the first people your dad sees,

98
00:08:22,768 --> 00:08:26,079
- not some hotel desk clerk
- Whatever.

99
00:08:28,574 --> 00:08:30,076
County off to the east in Linn County

100
00:08:30,142 --> 00:08:32,122
the situation is turning a little worse

101
00:08:32,178 --> 00:08:34,715
We're going from the thunderstorms now,
severe weather.

102
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:37,226
Quite a bit of hail
reported down in Linn County

103
00:08:37,283 --> 00:08:39,889
and that is indicative
of these storms strengthening

104
00:08:39,952 --> 00:08:41,590
Once you see the purple, the bright

105
00:09:17,323 --> 00:09:19,894
mobile homes and vehicles
should be abandoned

106
00:09:19,959 --> 00:09:22,940
for sturdier shelter.
Otherwise go to an interior room

107
00:09:22,995 --> 00:09:26,272
on the lowest level
of your home or place of business.

108
00:09:26,332 --> 00:09:28,812
Make sure there are as many floors
and walls between you

109
00:09:28,868 --> 00:09:30,438
from the outside as possible.

110
00:09:30,503 --> 00:09:33,882
Repeating: A tornado warning
remains in effect...

111
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:35,817
Please, I've lived in Kansas
my whole life.

112
00:09:35,875 --> 00:09:37,821
I've never once seen a tornado

113
00:09:37,877 --> 00:09:40,187
You know you were born
during a tornado.

114
00:09:40,246 --> 00:09:42,920
Yeah, I never heard that before

115
00:09:42,982 --> 00:09:45,519
I can't say I remember much about it.

116
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:48,424
Ditto

117
00:09:49,522 --> 00:09:52,594
Hey, Mom?
Can I change my name?

118
00:09:52,658 --> 00:09:54,934
Why would you want to do that?

119
00:09:54,994 --> 00:09:59,033
Sally is just so unprofessional

120
00:09:59,098 --> 00:10:00,441
What do you mean?

121
00:10:00,499 --> 00:10:02,137
Well, can I at least go by Sarah?

122
00:10:02,201 --> 00:10:05,307
But your name's not Sarah
it's Sally.

123
00:10:05,371 --> 00:10:07,510
Your father named you

124
00:10:07,573 --> 00:10:09,644
Yeah, you were named
after Charlie Brown's sister

125
00:10:09,709 --> 00:10:12,747
I was not, Jennifer!

126
00:10:12,812 --> 00:10:15,349
Hey, Alice, how's your book?

127
00:10:16,449 --> 00:10:18,451
It's fine

128
00:10:18,517 --> 00:10:20,622
What's it about?

129
00:10:20,686 --> 00:10:23,462
A lot of things

130
00:10:23,522 --> 00:10:25,524
Like?

131
00:10:25,591 --> 00:10:29,698
- It's a bunch of short stories
- They any good?

132
00:10:29,762 --> 00:10:31,969
Haven't you read them?

133
00:10:32,031 --> 00:10:35,035
Yes, but I want to know
what you think.

134
00:10:35,101 --> 00:10:37,638
Magma?

135
00:10:37,703 --> 00:10:40,377
- A tornado warning remains in effect
- They're fine.

136
00:10:40,439 --> 00:10:42,077
...until 5:15 PM
Central Daylight Time

137
00:10:42,141 --> 00:10:44,849
in Linn County in Kansas.
The National Weather Service

138
00:10:44,910 --> 00:10:47,516
in Topeka, Kansas,
has issued a tornado warning

139
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:50,459
for northeastern Linn County
near Blue Mound, Kansas...

140
00:10:50,516 --> 00:10:52,928
Mom, I have to pee

141
00:10:52,985 --> 00:10:55,795
-Weather Service Doppler radar... Peachy.

142
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:10,648
sturdier shelter

143
00:11:10,703 --> 00:11:12,705
<i>Otherwise, go to an interior room</i>

144
00:11:12,772 --> 00:11:15,946
on the lowest level of your home
or place of business.

146
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:21,522
A tornado warning remains in effect

147
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:23,719
until 5:15 PM Central Daylight Time

148
00:11:23,783 --> 00:11:26,787
in Linn County in Kansas.
The National Weather Serv--

149
00:11:30,022 --> 00:11:31,899
Sally, I told you to go before we left.

150
00:11:31,957 --> 00:11:34,164
Hurry, gotta pee!

151
00:11:34,226 --> 00:11:36,433
- Sorry.
- It's okay

152
00:11:36,495 --> 00:11:39,101
You-- you all right there, ma'am?

153
00:11:39,165 --> 00:11:41,167
Yeah. We're heading
to Kansas City tonight

154
00:11:41,233 --> 00:11:43,304
Oh, I really don't think
that's a very good idea

155
00:11:43,369 --> 00:11:45,406
There's a tornado ripping
thought Blue Mound right now

156
00:11:45,471 --> 00:11:48,077
- It's headed this way
- Oh, really?

157
00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:51,280
My husband's flight gets in
in a couple of hours.

158
00:11:51,343 --> 00:11:54,085
He's in the military.
He's coming home from overseas tonight.

159
00:11:54,146 --> 00:11:56,820
Well, I reckon he could
wait a few more hours

160
00:11:56,882 --> 00:11:59,453
as opposed to his wife
and daughters having an accident

161
00:12:01,053 --> 00:12:02,930
Where would we go?

162
00:12:02,988 --> 00:12:06,629
I'm the wrong guy to ask.
I'm new here myself as of last week

163
00:12:06,692 --> 00:12:08,899
But I'd be willing to bet
any of these old farmers

164
00:12:08,961 --> 00:12:11,066
would let you hole up in their cellar

165
00:12:15,034 --> 00:12:17,708
Looks like the townspeople are
really taking this storm seriously

166
00:12:17,770 --> 00:12:20,842
You folks best get some shelter

167
00:12:20,906 --> 00:12:22,442
Thanks

168
00:12:30,649 --> 00:12:32,754
Need any help
closing up, Mrs. Shurman?

169
00:12:32,818 --> 00:12:33,922
No, thank you, Barney

170
00:12:33,986 --> 00:12:37,593
Carr, get those people out of here

171
00:12:42,828 --> 00:12:45,809
Now you all be damned careful
out there.

172
00:12:45,865 --> 00:12:47,503
Thanks

173
00:12:50,669 --> 00:12:53,149
I can't believe
his name is Barney

174
00:13:13,726 --> 00:13:15,831
A tornado warning remains in effect

175
00:13:15,895 --> 00:13:19,468
until 5:15 PM Central Daylight Time
in Linn County.

176
00:13:19,532 --> 00:13:21,409
At 3:41 Central Day--

177
00:13:28,374 --> 00:13:30,854
What is that?

I think we're safe.
I think we're okay

Okay.
Jen, are you okay?

Yeah. Are you?

211
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,529
Yeah

212
00:17:36,588 --> 00:17:38,261
Everybody

213
00:17:38,323 --> 00:17:40,769
I'm fine

214
00:17:42,127 --> 00:17:44,437
Honey, you're always fine

00:17:49,735 --> 00:17:51,442
Okay, come here

216
00:18:14,126 --> 00:18:16,072
Wow

217
00:18:16,128 --> 00:18:18,165
That was intense

218
00:18:20,332 --> 00:18:22,835
Don't tell Dad I cried

219
00:18:22,901 --> 00:18:24,608
Oh, honey

220
00:18:24,670 --> 00:18:26,377
It's okay.

221
00:18:33,312 --> 00:18:35,053
Where are we?

222
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:38,220
You think the storm's over?

223
00:18:38,283 --> 00:18:40,763
I think it's over enough
for us to leave.

224
00:18:55,901 --> 00:18:59,815
Damn it.
There's a tree across the door

225
00:18:59,872 --> 00:19:01,442
Shit, ow

226
00:19:02,541 --> 00:19:04,885
Jennifer, can you help?

227
00:19:04,943 --> 00:19:06,547
Oh, Shit-

228
00:19:06,612 --> 00:19:09,491
Push, hard

229
00:19:15,187 --> 00:19:17,497
Okay

230
00:19:19,358 --> 00:19:20,928
Now what?

231
00:19:25,097 --> 00:19:26,735
Come on.

232
00:19:53,625 --> 00:19:56,367
Well, at least there's booze

233
00:19:59,097 --> 00:20:00,633
sorry

234
00:20:09,341 --> 00:20:12,049
Let's see if somebody's home?

235
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:15,716
Hey! Anybody up there?!

236
00:20:15,781 --> 00:20:18,625
Help! Help!

237
00:20:20,252 --> 00:20:22,357
- Hey!
- Hello?!

238
00:20:22,421 --> 00:20:24,059
Shh, wait a minute.

239
00:20:30,762 --> 00:20:33,368
] yam [mag
cellphone?

240
00:20:33,432 --> 00:20:35,275
Oh, duh-

241
00:20:37,369 --> 00:20:39,815
- You got a signal?
- Yeah, three bars.

242
00:20:39,871 --> 00:20:41,976
It's roaming though
Is that okay?

243
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:44,350
Yeah, I think
the extra charge is okay

244
00:20:49,114 --> 00:20:50,957
Nothing.

245
00:20:51,016 --> 00:20:54,429
Nothing?
Are you connected?

246
00:20:54,486 --> 00:20:57,797
Yeah, it connects.
It just connects to static

247
00:20:59,324 --> 00:21:01,326
- Who are you trying to call?
- 911.

248
00:21:01,393 --> 00:21:02,895
Keep trying

249
00:21:07,733 --> 00:21:10,111
If you push me up there,
I bet I could fit through.

250
00:21:10,168 --> 00:21:12,842
Oh, honey.
Are you sure?

251
00:21:12,904 --> 00:21:16,374
No, but if you break out
the rest of the glass, I'll try

252
00:21:16,441 --> 00:21:18,717
Any luck, Jen?

253
00:21:18,777 --> 00:21:21,621
No.

254
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:23,182
- Try texting someone
- Yeah.

255
00:21:23,248 --> 00:21:25,319
Good idea.

256
00:21:25,384 --> 00:21:27,796
Wow, you're fast at that

257
00:21:30,055 --> 00:21:32,228
Who are you texting?

258
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:35,329
- His name's Sean.
- Yeah? Who's that?

259
00:21:35,394 --> 00:21:37,965
He's a guy that would travel
through a storm to get laid.

260
00:21:38,030 --> 00:21:40,738
Jen, please, the girls

261
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:43,575
Mom, please, I think we have
bigger fish to catch right now

262
00:21:43,635 --> 00:21:44,739
Damn!

263
00:21:44,803 --> 00:21:45,907
What is it?

264
00:21:45,971 --> 00:21:47,507
Unable to send text message

265
00:21:47,572 --> 00:21:49,813
Well, maybe it'll send
after the storm clears

266
00:21:49,875 --> 00:21:53,015
Hey, will you send
a message to your dad?

267
00:21:57,249 --> 00:21:59,820
- Okay, you ready to try this?
- Mm-hmm.

268
00:21:59,885 --> 00:22:02,297
I'm gonna knock
the rest of the glass out

269
00:22:02,354 --> 00:22:06,928
Dad, stuck in a cellar
halfway to KC.

270
00:22:06,992 --> 00:22:08,835
Running late

271
00:22:08,894 --> 00:22:12,671
Be there soon, Jen

272
00:22:12,731 --> 00:22:15,678
Okay,"message pending".

273
00:22:15,734 --> 00:22:18,510
Hopefully he'll get it soon

274
00:22:18,570 --> 00:22:20,982
It's "fry," by the way

275
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:22,677
What?

276
00:22:22,741 --> 00:22:25,221
You just said we had
bigger fish to catch,

277
00:22:25,277 --> 00:22:28,190
but really it's bigger fish to fry

278
00:22:28,246 --> 00:22:30,192
Oh, thanks

279
00:22:30,248 --> 00:22:31,591
Sure.

280
00:22:32,617 --> 00:22:34,426
You should talk more

281
00:22:34,486 --> 00:22:36,762
Why?

282
00:22:36,822 --> 00:22:39,598
Because you're smart

283
00:22:46,465 --> 00:22:48,968
Are you ready?

284
00:22:49,034 --> 00:22:51,708
Yes.

285
00:22:57,676 --> 00:22:59,451
Is that--

286
00:23:06,385 --> 00:23:09,855
Do you think they heard us?

287
00:23:09,921 --> 00:23:12,959
I don't know how
they couldn't have

288
00:23:15,660 --> 00:23:18,641
What the hell?

289
00:23:21,933 --> 00:23:24,072
Why would they do that?

290
00:23:28,340 --> 00:23:30,342
I don't know

291
00:23:32,277 --> 00:23:33,779
What was that?

292
00:23:33,845 --> 00:23:36,223
I'm willing to give
that window thing a try

293
00:23:36,281 --> 00:23:39,228
Yeah. Come on

294
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:59,548
It's throbbing,
it's throbbing inside!

295
00:23:59,604 --> 00:24:03,450
Go get something
to wrap her arm! Go now!

296
00:24:03,508 --> 00:24:07,081
- Oh my--
- Help me!

297
00:24:07,145 --> 00:24:08,818
Help me!

298
00:24:10,282 --> 00:24:12,319
What is all this shit?

299
00:24:17,923 --> 00:24:18,993
Rope

300
00:24:20,459 --> 00:24:22,666
rope-

301
00:24:24,529 --> 00:24:27,100
Okay, let me see, let me look

302
00:24:39,744 --> 00:24:41,690
This is soft

303
00:24:47,619 --> 00:24:49,428
Come on.

304
00:24:50,789 --> 00:24:52,769
Here here

305
00:24:53,792 --> 00:24:57,569
- Ow, don't! No!
- Shh shh, oh baby

306
00:24:57,629 --> 00:25:01,338
It's okay.
Hold still, hold still

307
00:25:01,399 --> 00:25:02,707
Shh, there

308
00:25:02,767 --> 00:25:05,441
It's okay, sweetheart

309
00:25:05,504 --> 00:25:09,008
I won't tell Daddy
you cried, I promise

310
00:25:17,215 --> 00:25:19,752
What did that to her?

311
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:24,760
I don't know

312
00:25:57,122 --> 00:26:00,194
- Is she gonna be okay?
- Yeah.

313
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:04,238
We just-- we just need
to get her to a hospital

314
00:26:04,296 --> 00:26:06,970
- right away.
- What happened to her?

315
00:26:09,134 --> 00:26:11,011
I don't know

316
00:26:12,504 --> 00:26:16,247
I think maybe--
I think maybe she got bit by a dog

317
00:26:16,308 --> 00:26:20,757
Mom, did you see her arm?

318
00:26:20,812 --> 00:26:22,382
I know

319
00:26:22,447 --> 00:26:25,053
What?

320
00:26:25,116 --> 00:26:26,652
It didn't look like a dog

321
00:26:26,718 --> 00:26:29,528
Of course it was a dog.
What else would it have been?

322
00:26:29,588 --> 00:26:33,502
It just looked--
it just looked too clean--

323
00:26:33,558 --> 00:26:35,435
Jennifer, please

324
00:26:37,028 --> 00:26:40,100
We need to-- we need to get her
to a hospital right away.

325
00:26:40,165 --> 00:26:41,769
Shh, Mom-

326
00:26:52,444 --> 00:26:55,391
Ah, come here

327
00:26:55,447 --> 00:26:58,724
It's okay. Here, I want you
to stay with Sally.

328
00:27:01,586 --> 00:27:03,566
Come here.

329
00:27:14,332 --> 00:27:17,006
Here, I'll help

330
00:27:17,068 --> 00:27:20,174

The windows!
Get through the windows!

333
00:27:39,591 --> 00:27:41,628
What the fuck is wrong
with you people?

334
00:27:41,693 --> 00:27:43,468
Let us out!

335
00:27:51,236 --> 00:27:53,307
Where the hell are we?

336
00:27:54,839 --> 00:27:56,682
What now?

337
00:27:59,544 --> 00:28:01,922
I don't know

338
00:28:08,853 --> 00:28:13,802
Sally is passed out

339
00:28:13,858 --> 00:28:16,805
Someone is...

340
00:28:16,861 --> 00:28:21,276
keeping us here.

341
00:28:21,332 --> 00:28:25,439
Please help.

342
00:28:25,503 --> 00:28:27,505
We are

343
00:28:27,572 --> 00:28:30,712
in Wellsville."

344
00:28:35,814 --> 00:28:38,886
Hey, Jen, we need
to clean Sally's wound

345
00:28:38,950 --> 00:28:40,657
- There's water
- Where?

346
00:28:40,719 --> 00:28:42,665
On the shelf in the corner

347
00:28:42,721 --> 00:28:44,826
Okay, let's go get some

348
00:28:49,194 --> 00:28:51,140
Another storm?

349
00:28:53,031 --> 00:28:54,339
Yeah

350
00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:56,777
The radio said
it's going to storm all night

351
00:29:05,310 --> 00:29:07,483
I'll go get that water

352
00:29:26,030 --> 00:29:28,101
Come on.

353
00:29:49,420 --> 00:29:52,458
- Oh my God.
- I wish your dad was here

354
00:29:57,962 --> 00:30:00,101
- What is that smell?
- It's not water.

355
00:30:01,166 --> 00:30:03,112
Wow

356
00:30:05,436 --> 00:30:06,915
Definitely not water

357
00:30:06,971 --> 00:30:09,315
- What is it?
- I think it's moonshine

358
00:30:09,374 --> 00:30:11,354
What? Why?

359
00:30:11,409 --> 00:30:13,184
That's alcohol

360
00:30:15,446 --> 00:30:18,893
I'm gonna use it to clean her wound
and it's gonna hurt like hell.

361
00:30:18,950 --> 00:30:21,021
Help me hold her down

362
00:30:25,523 --> 00:30:27,901
Okay, sweetie. Here we go

363
00:30:29,093 --> 00:30:31,596
Ahh!

364
00:30:34,599 --> 00:30:37,637
- Ow, Mommy!
- Mom, stop it. You're hurting her

365
00:30:37,702 --> 00:30:39,841
- Mom!
- It's okay, Alice

366
00:30:39,904 --> 00:30:42,043
I'm sorry.

367
00:30:42,106 --> 00:30:44,552
- Mom!
- I'm sorry

368
00:30:44,609 --> 00:30:46,850
I'm sorry.

369
00:30:52,417 --> 00:30:56,058
That's it.
That's it. Stay still

370
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:58,760
It's gonna be okay
I promise.

371
00:30:58,823 --> 00:31:00,860
Promise.

372
00:31:02,994 --> 00:31:04,735
Jennifer?

373
00:31:04,796 --> 00:31:07,276
Stay with me

374
00:31:07,332 --> 00:31:09,141
I will, Sally

375
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:12,374
I wont let anything happen to you,okay?
in

376
00:31:12,437 --> 00:31:14,883
I love you, Jennifer

377
00:31:14,939 --> 00:31:16,782
I love you too, Sally

378
00:31:16,841 --> 00:31:19,412
Just go to sleep now
and rest, okay?

379
00:31:19,477 --> 00:31:21,923
We're gonna find a way
to get you out of here.

380
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:04,730
You okay?

381
00:32:04,789 --> 00:32:06,769
Mm-hmm.

382
00:32:11,829 --> 00:32:14,241
There's got to be a way
out of this basement.

383
00:32:15,934 --> 00:32:17,914
Maybe a door that leads upstairs?

384
00:32:17,969 --> 00:32:20,176
Is there a flashlight or something?

385
00:32:20,238 --> 00:32:22,309
I don't know. Maybe

386
00:32:33,017 --> 00:32:35,327
Hey, Jen, do you have your lighter?

387
00:32:35,386 --> 00:32:37,297
Oh.

388
00:32:37,355 --> 00:32:40,302
Uh, no-

389
00:32:40,358 --> 00:32:42,861
It's in the car

390
00:32:42,927 --> 00:32:46,500
Jennifer?
Check Sally's pockets

391
00:32:46,564 --> 00:32:48,009
What?

392
00:32:48,066 --> 00:32:49,943
Promise not to be mad at Sally

393
00:32:50,001 --> 00:32:51,844
course.

394
00:32:51,903 --> 00:32:55,077
When we were in the car, she took
your lighter out of your backpack.

395
00:32:55,139 --> 00:32:57,551
- Really?
- Yeah, she thought maybe if you didn't

396
00:32:57,608 --> 00:32:59,884
have your lighter,
you wouldn't smoke

397
00:32:59,944 --> 00:33:01,981
Are you serious?

398
00:33:02,046 --> 00:33:04,492
Yeah, check her pockets?

399
00:33:08,519 --> 00:33:12,831
- I don't believe it.
- Sally saves the day

400
00:33:12,890 --> 00:33:15,734
I promise, Sally

401
00:33:15,793 --> 00:33:17,773
no more cigarettes, okay?

402
00:33:19,197 --> 00:33:21,074
Jen?

403
00:34:52,356 --> 00:34:54,734
- Hello, Barney.
- Hi, Mrs. Shurman

404
00:34:54,792 --> 00:34:57,272
Well, goodness sake,
get yourself out of this weather

405
00:34:57,328 --> 00:34:59,330
- You'll catch your death
- Thank you, ma'am.

406
00:34:59,397 --> 00:35:02,071
Can I get you a cup of coffee?
It's still warm.

407
00:35:02,133 --> 00:35:04,670
That'd be great. Thank you

408
00:35:04,735 --> 00:35:06,180
Are you baking something?

409
00:35:06,237 --> 00:35:08,376
Cookies before the power went off

410
00:35:08,439 --> 00:35:10,112
- Want one?
- Oh, sure.

411
00:35:10,174 --> 00:35:13,280
Looks like the tornado
went right through.

412
00:35:13,344 --> 00:35:15,153
Lot of trees and power lines down

413
00:35:15,213 --> 00:35:17,489
It'll be a hell of a clean-up effort
around here.

414
00:35:17,548 --> 00:35:20,586
Hell, it isn't even over.
Gonna storm all night

415
00:35:20,651 --> 00:35:23,530
That's what I heard.
Gotta love this time of year

416
00:35:23,588 --> 00:35:26,432
I never get used to it.

417
00:35:26,491 --> 00:35:29,961
- Makes people crazy in this town
- Yeah, I noticed.

418
00:35:30,027 --> 00:35:32,303
I'm surprised you weren't
holed up in your cellar?

419
00:35:32,363 --> 00:35:33,967
Waiting for the storm to pass

420
00:35:34,031 --> 00:35:36,944
Well, I prefer to wait it out up here

421
00:35:37,001 --> 00:35:39,845
- And bake?
- It calms my nerves.

422
00:35:41,372 --> 00:35:44,581
Uh, Mrs. Shurman, real quick
the reason I stopped by...

423
00:35:44,642 --> 00:35:45,848
Yes?

424
00:35:45,910 --> 00:35:47,787
Well, there's a car out front

425
00:35:47,845 --> 00:35:49,882
- Oh really?
- Yes ma'am

426
00:35:49,947 --> 00:35:52,791
It belongs to a couple ladies
on the road up to Kansas City

427
00:35:52,850 --> 00:35:54,727
And I was wondering
if you'd seen them.

428
00:35:54,785 --> 00:35:59,200
You don't say?
Well, no, I sure haven't seen 'em

429
00:35:59,257 --> 00:36:00,930
Mmm.

430
00:36:00,992 --> 00:36:04,337
Mrs. Shurman, their car
is out in the ditch by the road

431
00:36:04,395 --> 00:36:07,171
Mmm, perfect

432
00:36:07,231 --> 00:36:10,212
Well, I sure hope they're all okay

433
00:36:10,268 --> 00:36:14,045
Are you sure they didn't stop by here?

434
00:36:14,105 --> 00:36:16,711
It just seems like this would be
the first place they would check

435
00:36:16,774 --> 00:36:19,380
Well, not unless
they got here before I did

436
00:36:19,443 --> 00:36:21,389
How many of them
did you say there were?

437
00:36:21,445 --> 00:36:23,220
There were four of them actually

438
00:36:23,281 --> 00:36:25,386
There was a mother
and three of her daughters?

439
00:36:25,449 --> 00:36:26,826
Oh my.

440
00:36:26,884 --> 00:36:29,091
And you say they were
on their way to Kansas City?

441
00:36:29,153 --> 00:36:31,463
Yes, ma'am, to pick up
her husband at the airport

442
00:36:31,522 --> 00:36:34,196
Hello, Barney.
Out checking the roads, I see.

443
00:36:34,258 --> 00:36:36,260
Hey, Sheriff!
I didn't know you were here.

444
00:36:36,327 --> 00:36:38,739
I just stopped by to help her
board up her cellar.

445
00:36:38,796 --> 00:36:40,366
Oh, yeah, I was going
to ask about that.

446
00:36:40,431 --> 00:36:42,342
Looked like you got it
boarded up pretty good

447
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:43,743
Don't want a flood down there

448
00:36:43,801 --> 00:36:45,872
Lots of valuables
in that old storm cellar

449
00:36:45,937 --> 00:36:47,280
Yeah

450
00:36:47,338 --> 00:36:48,840
Sure.

451
00:36:48,906 --> 00:36:52,581
Well, I'd better get back
out on the road.

452
00:36:52,643 --> 00:36:55,487
Horseshit. Stay inside here
and have another cup of coffee?

453
00:36:55,546 --> 00:36:57,457
You know, Albert, I would love to,

454
00:36:57,515 --> 00:36:59,552
but those travelers
really got me worried

455
00:36:59,617 --> 00:37:02,496
They probably just went down
to Jacob's farm up the road.

456
00:37:02,553 --> 00:37:04,829
Yeah, I'll check there

457
00:37:04,889 --> 00:37:08,336
You sure I can't talk you
into another cup of coffee?

458
00:37:08,392 --> 00:37:11,839
My, those lights seem
to have a mind of their own?

459
00:37:11,896 --> 00:37:14,877
I'm sure they'll have them
up and running soon enough

460
00:37:14,932 --> 00:37:17,310
Yeah. Thank you
for the coffee, Mrs. Shurman

461
00:37:17,368 --> 00:37:19,712
But I really should
go check on those ladies.

462
00:37:19,770 --> 00:37:21,647
You be careful
out there now, Barney

463
00:37:21,706 --> 00:37:25,244
and don't forget to say hello to that
beautiful new bride of yours.

464
00:37:25,309 --> 00:37:27,812
Will do. Now you folks
get some candles lit.

465
00:37:27,878 --> 00:37:29,755
- No telling how long this will last
- Oh.

466
00:37:29,814 --> 00:37:31,623
Oh my!

467
00:37:31,682 --> 00:37:34,094
You forgot your cookies.

468
00:37:34,151 --> 00:37:38,361
Oh. Wow! What are they?

469
00:37:38,422 --> 00:37:40,527
They're little tornadoes

470
00:37:40,591 --> 00:37:42,468
Cute.

471
00:37:42,526 --> 00:37:44,199
Good night, folks

472
00:37:56,140 --> 00:37:59,553
If something happens,
you're explaining it to his wife

473
00:37:59,610 --> 00:38:01,749
Shouldn't have married him
in the first place,

474
00:38:01,812 --> 00:38:03,985
especially a month into storm season.

475
00:38:07,218 --> 00:38:08,993
Here, let me

476
00:38:10,054 --> 00:38:11,863
Is this for Dad?

477
00:38:11,922 --> 00:38:16,701
Yeah. These storms are harder
on him than they used to be.

478
00:38:32,743 --> 00:38:34,780
Roger?

479
00:38:34,845 --> 00:38:36,256
Settle down

480
00:38:50,528 --> 00:38:52,633
Is he getting a case of cabin fever?

481
00:38:52,697 --> 00:38:54,734
Just a little restless.

482
00:38:54,799 --> 00:38:57,336
I'm surprised that you grew out of it

483
00:38:57,401 --> 00:39:00,007
You used to be a real handful
this time of year.

484
00:39:00,071 --> 00:39:02,677
Storms really don't affect me
the way they used to.

485
00:39:02,740 --> 00:39:04,845
Teeth hurt a little--
that's about it.

486
00:39:04,909 --> 00:39:07,355
Now you get that
from my side of the family

487
00:39:07,411 --> 00:39:09,755
I wish your brothers
were more that way.

488
00:39:09,814 --> 00:39:12,761
If this supercell they keep
talking about gets any closer,

489
00:39:12,817 --> 00:39:15,093
I might not be able to control myself

490
00:39:15,152 --> 00:39:18,133
I'm gonna let Roger and the boys
out for a while tonight

491
00:39:18,189 --> 00:39:19,532
to enjoy the storm

492
00:39:19,590 --> 00:39:23,060
- Hershel's already out.
- Well, you know Hershel--

493
00:39:23,127 --> 00:39:25,198
always was a free spirit

494
00:39:25,262 --> 00:39:28,266
He took a bite out of one
of our visitors earlier.

495
00:39:28,332 --> 00:39:31,006
- And Tommy?
- In the cellar.

496
00:39:31,068 --> 00:39:33,241
The storm got to him early

497
00:39:33,304 --> 00:39:35,341
I was hoping that new
muzzle will help him.

498
00:39:35,406 --> 00:39:37,352
You know they make
those things for kids

499
00:39:37,408 --> 00:39:39,354
and they never work right anyway

500
00:39:39,410 --> 00:39:43,449
I had to chain him up and give him
some extra moonshine to calm him down

501
00:39:43,514 --> 00:39:46,154
Probably won't stay
that way for long though.

502
00:39:51,255 --> 00:39:54,327
It's a shame about
that family down there

503
00:39:54,392 --> 00:39:56,895
They seem real nice

504
00:40:52,049 --> 00:40:54,586
ls there somebody out there?

505
00:40:54,652 --> 00:40:57,155
- Hello?
- Hello?!

506
00:40:57,221 --> 00:40:59,064
Hello?

507
00:40:59,123 --> 00:41:01,933
This is Deputy Carr
from the Wellsville Sheriff's Department

508
00:41:01,992 --> 00:41:04,700
- Oh, thank God. Help us!
- We're trapped.

509
00:41:04,762 --> 00:41:07,766
Well, hold on, I'll see
if I can get you out.

510
00:41:20,177 --> 00:41:22,851
What the hell
are you doing down there?

511
00:41:22,913 --> 00:41:25,757
- Get us out of here
- Are you okay?

512
00:41:25,816 --> 00:41:27,193
My daughter needs help

513
00:41:27,251 --> 00:41:29,492
Hold on, I'll get the woman
who lives upstairs.

514
00:41:29,553 --> 00:41:31,794
- No!
- What?

515
00:41:31,856 --> 00:41:34,234
She's the one that
locked us down here

516
00:41:37,061 --> 00:41:40,338
All right. Let's get you
the hell out of there.

517
00:41:40,397 --> 00:41:42,138
Take my hand. I'll pull you out

518
00:41:42,199 --> 00:41:43,803
Alice, you first

519
00:42:00,518 --> 00:42:02,828
<i>Ahhh!</i>

520
00:42:16,133 --> 00:42:18,204
Hello?

521
00:42:20,104 --> 00:42:21,947
Hershel, calm down!

522
00:43:11,589 --> 00:43:13,569
Creepy

523
00:44:07,378 --> 00:44:10,086
Oswald triplets

524
00:44:31,702 --> 00:44:34,182
Where are you

525
00:44:34,238 --> 00:44:38,584
Sally is hurt bad

526
00:44:38,642 --> 00:44:42,886
A cop tried to help

527
00:44:48,752 --> 00:44:50,254
Help

528
00:45:48,212 --> 00:45:50,522
Struck by lightning

529
00:46:20,611 --> 00:46:22,648
Hey, I think I found
a hallway or something

530
00:46:22,713 --> 00:46:24,920
I'm gonna check it out

531
00:46:24,982 --> 00:46:27,189
Okay, I'll go with you

532
00:46:27,251 --> 00:46:29,925
- No.
- What?

533
00:46:31,088 --> 00:46:33,466
I said no

534
00:46:33,524 --> 00:46:36,004
Then let Alice go with you

535
00:46:36,059 --> 00:46:38,335
- I want you both to stay with Sally
- No, that's stupid.

536
00:46:38,395 --> 00:46:40,534
You're not going down
a dark hallway by yourself

537
00:46:40,597 --> 00:46:42,372
Jennifer

538
00:46:42,432 --> 00:46:45,106
I can stay with Sally.
It's not that big a deal

539
00:46:45,169 --> 00:46:47,877
- I don't want to leave you alone
- I'll be fine.

540
00:46:49,306 --> 00:46:51,980
Is it just me or does that
sound like a terrible idea?

541
00:46:52,042 --> 00:46:53,953
Yeah.
You're right.

542
00:46:55,979 --> 00:46:58,983
We all stay or we all go

543
00:47:03,253 --> 00:47:05,460
Then we all go

544
00:47:31,849 --> 00:47:34,796
How long is this tunnel?

545
00:47:34,852 --> 00:47:36,957
Must be 100 yards

546
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:04,860
What is it?

547
00:48:08,852 --> 00:48:11,093
I think it's a still

548
00:48:14,791 --> 00:48:16,896
Jen, careful with your lantern

549
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:18,530
Why?

550
00:48:18,595 --> 00:48:22,702
If that's a still
and this is a propane tank

551
00:48:22,766 --> 00:48:24,575
it could explode

552
00:48:49,559 --> 00:48:51,835
Alice, I need you to stay with Sally

553
00:48:51,895 --> 00:48:54,000
We'll be right down the hallway
so if you nee something,

554
00:48:54,064 --> 00:48:56,340
-just yell,okay?-Okay

555
00:48:56,400 --> 00:48:58,277
Mom?

556
00:48:58,335 --> 00:49:00,474
Yeah?

557
00:49:02,706 --> 00:49:05,778
What do I tell Sally
when she wakes up?

558
00:49:07,110 --> 00:49:09,351
Tell her everything's
going to be okay.

559
00:49:09,413 --> 00:49:11,552
Is that true?

560
00:49:14,851 --> 00:49:18,355
Alice, with every other
beat of my heart,

561
00:49:18,422 --> 00:49:20,663
I believe we're going to be okay

562
00:49:20,724 --> 00:49:22,533
Okay

563
00:49:22,592 --> 00:49:23,866
Okay

564
00:50:25,756 --> 00:50:27,599
It's not so bad

565
00:50:27,657 --> 00:50:31,195
No, it's just-- it's just awkward

566
00:50:31,261 --> 00:50:32,467
Really

567
00:50:32,529 --> 00:50:35,442
Okay, do you want to go
forwards or backwards?

568
00:50:35,499 --> 00:50:38,776
I'll go backwards.
Can you get the lantern?

569
00:50:38,835 --> 00:50:41,213
<i>Mm.'</i>

570
00:51:07,497 --> 00:51:08,999
Ready?

571
00:51:09,066 --> 00:51:11,103
- Wait wait.
- What what?

572
00:51:11,168 --> 00:51:13,341
I need to change my grip

573
00:51:13,403 --> 00:51:15,576
This could be a process

574
00:51:15,639 --> 00:51:18,051
- Ready?
- Yeah.

575
00:51:18,108 --> 00:51:20,349
Okay, back up

576
00:51:20,410 --> 00:51:23,948
- All right.
- Okay, you go first

577
00:51:24,014 --> 00:51:25,618
Okay

578
00:53:21,131 --> 00:53:23,941
Mom?

579
00:53:30,874 --> 00:53:33,616
Going too fast. Okay

580
00:53:35,245 --> 00:53:37,088
Yeah?

581
00:53:37,147 --> 00:53:38,717
You okay?

582
00:53:41,818 --> 00:53:43,297
Can you see now?

583
00:53:43,353 --> 00:53:44,855
That's good

584
00:53:56,633 --> 00:53:58,579
Here comes the door

585
00:53:58,635 --> 00:54:00,911
How's the ramp on your side?

586
00:54:00,971 --> 00:54:02,678
It's good.

587
00:54:02,739 --> 00:54:05,242
- Are you okay?
- Mm-hmm.

588
00:54:05,308 --> 00:54:07,584
All right, it's good

589
00:54:07,644 --> 00:54:10,386
- Don't go too fast
- Sorry.

590
00:54:10,447 --> 00:54:13,223
Wait, do you hear something?

591
00:54:15,285 --> 00:54:17,595
What is that?

592
00:54:17,654 --> 00:54:19,429
I don't know

593
00:54:19,489 --> 00:54:21,366
Keep going.

594
00:54:21,424 --> 00:54:24,530
That's it. All right

595
00:54:29,766 --> 00:54:32,770
Mom, where's Alice?

596
00:54:32,836 --> 00:54:34,611
Alice?

597
00:54:34,671 --> 00:54:36,582
Alice?

598
00:54:36,640 --> 00:54:39,314
Put the still there

599
00:54:39,376 --> 00:54:40,855
Alice?

600
00:54:40,910 --> 00:54:43,015
- Alice? Alice?
- Where is she?

601
00:54:44,914 --> 00:54:46,825
Where is she?

602
00:54:46,883 --> 00:54:48,385
Alice?

603
00:54:52,188 --> 00:54:54,361
What the hell is this?

604
00:54:54,424 --> 00:54:56,335
Alice?

605
00:55:41,871 --> 00:55:43,373
Oh God, no!

606
00:55:49,979 --> 00:55:53,426
Oh no!

607
00:55:53,483 --> 00:55:56,225
I'm sorry. Oh, my baby

608
00:55:58,088 --> 00:56:00,659
Oh God, oh

609
00:56:00,724 --> 00:56:03,034
Oh God, no!

610
00:56:28,284 --> 00:56:30,594
Mom?

611
00:56:31,755 --> 00:56:34,065
We have to get out of here.

612
00:56:36,559 --> 00:56:38,800
Mom, we can't give up

613
00:56:42,832 --> 00:56:45,108
Jennifer

614
00:56:45,168 --> 00:56:47,739
we're gonna die here

615
00:56:47,804 --> 00:56:50,250
No, we're not

616
00:56:50,306 --> 00:56:53,048
You still have daughters
who need you right now.

617
00:57:04,421 --> 00:57:06,958
I won't give up

618
00:57:31,948 --> 00:57:34,189
Jennifer?

619
00:57:34,250 --> 00:57:36,321
What was that thing?

620
00:57:36,386 --> 00:57:39,458
I don't know.
But next time we'll be ready for it

621
00:57:45,261 --> 00:57:46,763
Mom?

622
00:57:48,097 --> 00:57:50,077
Mom?

623
00:57:50,133 --> 00:57:52,135
Give me a minute

624
00:57:56,706 --> 00:57:58,845
Never mind

625
00:58:16,292 --> 00:58:18,329
Mom, are you okay?

626
00:58:18,394 --> 00:58:20,738
No, Jennifer

627
00:58:20,797 --> 00:58:24,074
I'm not fine

628
00:58:28,438 --> 00:58:31,044
Mom, I need you
to pull it together

629
00:58:35,478 --> 00:58:38,652
Pull it together?
Your little sister just--

630
00:58:38,715 --> 00:58:41,594
Mom, I'm thinking
about right now, okay?

631
00:58:41,651 --> 00:58:44,757
And right now we need to put
that contraption in front of the door

632
00:58:44,821 --> 00:58:47,199
and blow it off the hinges.

633
00:58:51,160 --> 00:58:53,231
And I need your help

634
00:59:30,166 --> 00:59:31,941
Do you hear that?

635
00:59:32,001 --> 00:59:33,981
Uh-huh

636
00:59:52,655 --> 00:59:54,157
Mom!

637
01:00:32,495 --> 01:00:34,497
- Jennifer?
- Mom!

638
01:00:38,368 --> 01:00:40,439
Oh God

639
01:00:41,871 --> 01:00:43,782
Can you stand?

640
01:00:45,108 --> 01:00:48,112
You gotta get Sally out of here

641
01:00:48,177 --> 01:00:50,020
We're all getting out of here

642
01:01:02,058 --> 01:01:04,163
Look at how happy Dad is

643
01:01:04,227 --> 01:01:07,003
I haven't seen him
with this much energy in years

644
01:01:07,063 --> 01:01:08,701
Should we let Roger out?

645
01:01:08,765 --> 01:01:11,678
Give your dad a little while

646
01:01:16,305 --> 01:01:19,479
Looks like that second storm
is coming after all.

647
01:01:19,542 --> 01:01:21,249
It's gonna be strong

648
01:01:21,310 --> 01:01:23,586
Then I guess that explains
all their energy.

649
01:01:23,646 --> 01:01:26,149
They're gonna sleep
for a month after this

650
01:01:51,340 --> 01:01:53,342
Where am I?

651
01:01:53,409 --> 01:01:56,049
- It's okay, Sally.
- Jennifer, it hurts

652
01:01:56,112 --> 01:01:58,183
I know, Sally

653
01:01:58,247 --> 01:02:00,955
- Where's Mom?
- Right here, sweetie

654
01:02:01,017 --> 01:02:03,588
Mom, are you okay?

655
01:02:03,653 --> 01:02:07,260
Sally, Mom got hurt real bad

656
01:02:07,323 --> 01:02:09,599
I'm fine

657
01:02:09,659 --> 01:02:12,037
- Where's Alice?
- Sally, we have to get out of here

658
01:02:12,095 --> 01:02:13,904
- What's going on?
- We need to leave.

659
01:02:13,963 --> 01:02:16,034
I need you to cover
yourself, okay?

660
01:02:16,099 --> 01:02:19,876
I-- what do you mean?
Where's Alice?

661
01:02:22,305 --> 01:02:24,285
Alice is gone

662
01:02:26,442 --> 01:02:29,252
She-- she's dead?

663
01:02:29,312 --> 01:02:31,451
Yes. Now, Sally,
we have to get out of here

664
01:02:31,514 --> 01:02:32,993
Can you walk?

665
01:02:34,851 --> 01:02:36,694
Bleeding.

666
01:02:36,753 --> 01:02:39,700
It's okay, honey.
I need you to be strong

667
01:02:39,756 --> 01:02:42,532
and we're gonna
get out of here, okay?

668
01:02:42,592 --> 01:02:45,038
We're gonna get Dad too, okay?

669
01:02:45,094 --> 01:02:46,402
Come on.

670
01:02:46,462 --> 01:02:50,933
I need you to get behind me
and cover your heads.

671
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:53,981
- What are you going to do?
- I'm gonna throw this,

672
01:02:54,036 --> 01:02:56,312
you're gonna hide, okay?

673
01:02:56,372 --> 01:02:58,045
Can you run?

674
01:02:58,107 --> 01:02:59,882
- I don't think--
- If I help you?

675
01:02:59,942 --> 01:03:01,353
- <i>I'll</i> try
- Okay.

676
01:04:16,819 --> 01:04:18,093
Mom!

677
01:04:22,124 --> 01:04:24,434
Mom!

678
01:04:24,493 --> 01:04:26,404
Mom?

679
01:04:26,462 --> 01:04:29,739
Mom, please wake up

680
01:04:29,799 --> 01:04:31,278
Mommy, please!

681
01:04:33,970 --> 01:04:36,450
Thank you, Mommy

682
01:04:45,848 --> 01:04:47,691
Are you ready?

683
01:04:47,750 --> 01:04:49,195
Okay

684
01:05:01,297 --> 01:05:03,903
Are you okay?

685
01:05:05,568 --> 01:05:07,013
Behind you!

686
01:05:24,387 --> 01:05:25,923
Shit!

687
01:05:29,725 --> 01:05:31,068
Jennifer!

688
01:06:05,928 --> 01:06:08,306
Why didn't you just listen
to the weatherman for once?

689
01:06:08,364 --> 01:06:10,742
Relax, all right? We're not
the only ones with trees down

690
01:06:10,800 --> 01:06:12,040
It's gonna be fine

691
01:06:12,101 --> 01:06:14,103
I told you to cut down
that branch last year.

692
01:06:14,170 --> 01:06:15,945
What if it would
have hit the nursery?

693
01:06:16,005 --> 01:06:17,985
It wasn't going to hit the nursery

694
01:06:22,011 --> 01:06:24,355
Honey, come here

695
01:06:26,849 --> 01:06:28,453
What the--

696
01:06:33,456 --> 01:06:34,560
You girls okay?

697
01:06:34,623 --> 01:06:36,398
She's cut up pretty badly

698
01:06:36,459 --> 01:06:38,632
Let's get you guys inside
Come on.

699
01:06:44,667 --> 01:06:47,477
All right, let's take a look

700
01:06:53,876 --> 01:06:55,719
Oh, sweetie

701
01:06:57,279 --> 01:06:59,486
We gotta get her out of here
or call the cops--

702
01:06:59,548 --> 01:07:01,494
Shh.

703
01:07:01,550 --> 01:07:04,224
It's gonna be all right

704
01:07:04,286 --> 01:07:06,732
It does look pretty infected though.

705
01:07:06,789 --> 01:07:08,996
- You poor thing.
- You don't understand

706
01:07:09,058 --> 01:07:11,834
- There were things out there that--
- Just calm down.

707
01:07:11,894 --> 01:07:13,805
I'm gonna go call for help

708
01:07:13,863 --> 01:07:17,572
Let's get you some new bandages
Bathroom's this way.

709
01:07:17,633 --> 01:07:19,237
Come on.

710
01:07:20,669 --> 01:07:22,671
<i>Ahhh!</i>

711
01:07:25,207 --> 01:07:27,517
Ah, hee hee hee!

712
01:07:32,281 --> 01:07:34,420
Poor kid's teething
in the other room.

713
01:07:34,483 --> 01:07:37,487
There's disinfectant
and bandages in the top drawer

714
01:07:37,553 --> 01:07:40,397
- Just take whatever you need
- Thanks.

715
01:07:45,094 --> 01:07:48,837
This baby's just
kicking up a storm

716
01:07:48,898 --> 01:07:51,344
I hate when this happens
Excuse me.

717
01:09:05,674 --> 01:09:06,778
Jennifer! Jennifer!

718
01:09:06,842 --> 01:09:10,551
Sally! Sally, no!

719
01:09:10,613 --> 01:09:13,560
Get away from me!
Please get away from me!

720
01:09:13,616 --> 01:09:17,257
Jennifer, help me!
Jennifer, please help me!

721
01:09:17,319 --> 01:09:20,698
- Sally!
- Ahh! Jennifer!

722
01:09:24,960 --> 01:09:26,530
Jennifer!

723
01:09:53,989 --> 01:09:55,866
I'm so sorry, Sally

724
01:10:20,516 --> 01:10:22,462
There's no need to run, sweetie

725
01:10:22,518 --> 01:10:24,896
We just want to have
a word with you.

726
01:10:24,954 --> 01:10:27,093
Get the fuck back

727
01:10:28,958 --> 01:10:32,633
You're lucky that the storm affects
each one of us a bit differently.

728
01:10:32,695 --> 01:10:35,835
Otherwise you'd be dead already

729
01:10:49,678 --> 01:10:51,521
Shit

730
01:11:27,383 --> 01:11:30,694
This is where we
part company, dear

731
01:12:33,949 --> 01:12:35,690
Shit!

732
01:12:43,359 --> 01:12:45,737
No no no no!

733
01:13:39,515 --> 01:13:43,190
No dead. But there's still a lot
of us unaccounted for--

734
01:13:43,252 --> 01:13:46,028
mostly youngsters

735
01:13:46,088 --> 01:13:48,159
But you know
how these storms go

736
01:13:48,223 --> 01:13:50,430
Some of them just don't know
how to recover yet.

737
01:13:50,492 --> 01:13:52,631
They'll find their way home
this afternoon.

738
01:13:54,062 --> 01:13:56,167
Any signs of the girl?

739
01:13:56,231 --> 01:13:58,108
No.

740
01:13:58,167 --> 01:14:00,545
You think she's still alive?

741
01:14:07,843 --> 01:14:10,847
No, she's gone with the storm

742
01:14:11,980 --> 01:14:13,482
With this much damage,

743
01:14:13,549 --> 01:14:16,223
there'll be news teams
heading this way.

744
01:14:16,285 --> 01:14:18,265
We'll see

745
01:14:21,056 --> 01:14:23,536
I'm sorry about your mother

746
01:14:32,267 --> 01:14:34,975
More storms coming
in a few hours.

747
01:14:35,037 --> 01:14:37,483
Could be worse than last night
