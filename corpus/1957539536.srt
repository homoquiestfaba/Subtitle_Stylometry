2
00:00:12,046 --> 00:00:14,842
[narrator] Vampires 
are things of legend.

3
00:00:18,225 --> 00:00:22,229
Problem with legends 
is they do not die.

4
00:00:23,885 --> 00:00:26,543
Whether you believe 
in the vampire or not,

5
00:00:26,578 --> 00:00:28,959
the vampire does not care.

6
00:00:33,102 --> 00:00:37,244
If the vampire is hungry, 
any throat will do.

[sinuous, percussive music]

8
00:01:21,288 --> 00:01:24,463
And after you are sucked 
bone dry,

9
00:01:24,498 --> 00:01:28,881
the vampire disappears, 
and the legend continues.

You are taking forever.

So where are you from?

00:01:42,964 --> 00:01:44,276
Transylvania.

16
00:01:44,311 --> 00:01:45,726
Can't you tell?

Hey, what about paying me?

25
00:02:13,719 --> 00:02:15,790
Be happy you got away
with your life.

00:02:16,619 --> 00:02:18,828

So, you heard?

48
00:03:55,545 --> 00:03:57,029
Yes.

[female vampire]
Why didn't you answer the door?

50
00:03:59,308 --> 00:04:01,862
I have to save my energy.

51
00:04:01,896 --> 00:04:03,588
I have very little left.

Brandusa, Grigore,
nice to see you both.

You're looking well, Vampfather,

66
00:04:58,815 --> 00:05:00,645

Brandusa, Daciana,
Grigore, been a while.

Sorry I'm late.

73
00:05:24,669 --> 00:05:26,843
One more minute and I
would have met my fate.

74
00:05:32,193 --> 00:05:34,472
Finally,
after all these years,

75
00:05:34,506 --> 00:05:37,406
you learn to open the door
by yourselves.

76
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:42,342
There's promise
for your development.

77
00:05:42,376 --> 00:05:46,794
Too bad your development
is coming to a mortal end.

78
00:05:46,829 --> 00:05:48,520
We are immortal.

79
00:05:48,555 --> 00:05:51,109
We've been around
for 6,000 years.

80
00:05:51,834 --> 00:05:55,734
Granddaughter, you've
always been the feisty one.

[huffs]

82
00:06:01,153 --> 00:06:03,293
There's no blood to feast.

83
00:06:04,709 --> 00:06:06,227
I'm starving.

[swirling music]

86
00:06:19,448 --> 00:06:24,384
Your second cousin Grigore
needs the most blood.

87
00:06:24,970 --> 00:06:27,076
He comes form the older tribe.

88
00:06:27,110 --> 00:06:31,183
Your sister Daciana needs
the least blood,

89
00:06:31,218 --> 00:06:33,393
but is the weakest.

90
00:06:33,427 --> 00:06:36,913
Nicolae, my good nephew,
has the mutation

91
00:06:36,948 --> 00:06:41,539
where he can temporarily
survive on bat blood.

92
00:06:41,573 --> 00:06:46,992
But all our strengths and
weaknesses befall us tonight.

93
00:06:47,027 --> 00:06:50,064
[dark, suspenseful music]

94
00:06:55,622 --> 00:07:01,766
The blood of man has become
too pure with virtue.

95
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:07,185
Our hopes of man falling prey
to the evil side

96
00:07:07,219 --> 00:07:09,636
dissolved with the free choice

97
00:07:09,670 --> 00:07:12,328
of kindness and selfless love.

98
00:07:13,674 --> 00:07:16,332
We are the last of the vampire.

99
00:07:18,265 --> 00:07:22,372
All our species are gone,
but for us remaining.

[thunder rumbles]

105
00:07:56,545 --> 00:07:59,409
We have survived thousands
of years

106
00:07:59,444 --> 00:08:03,379
to be outsmarted by mortal man.

107
00:08:04,311 --> 00:08:05,657
Fuckers!

108
00:08:05,692 --> 00:08:07,866
Just one last bite.

109
00:08:08,557 --> 00:08:10,490
It would kill you instantly.

110
00:08:13,113 --> 00:08:15,011
But I'm so hungry.

111
00:08:16,150 --> 00:08:17,807
Me, too.

112
00:08:17,842 --> 00:08:20,845
[dark music]

113
00:08:26,471 --> 00:08:29,819

[Vampfather sighs]

117
00:09:20,870 --> 00:09:22,458
Now...

118
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:26,289
you will plunge the stake

119
00:09:27,912 --> 00:09:31,605
in the bullseye middle
of your heart.

120
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:34,435
Carefully, do not miss
the point,

121
00:09:34,470 --> 00:09:38,094
or the pain will be worse
than the death.

122
00:09:41,477 --> 00:09:43,652
Not my idea of a holiday.

123
00:09:45,930 --> 00:09:47,483
Is there no other way?

124
00:09:50,935 --> 00:09:52,350
[echoes] No.

[growls]

128
00:10:03,292 --> 00:10:06,433
That's all we've done
for thousands of years--bad.

129
00:10:06,467 --> 00:10:09,816
Something forbidden
in the vampire codes.

130
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:12,439
Like what?

131
00:10:12,473 --> 00:10:13,682
No, children!

132
00:10:14,993 --> 00:10:17,168
You shall go out with honor.

133
00:10:17,202 --> 00:10:19,480
It's the only sensible thing
to do.

134
00:10:19,515 --> 00:10:22,656
You only have hours,
a day or two,

135
00:10:23,830 --> 00:10:25,970
before you die of starvation.

136
00:10:26,004 --> 00:10:27,350
This...

137
00:10:29,456 --> 00:10:30,871
is the way.

[dramatic music]

139
00:10:46,369 --> 00:10:48,164
Pity.

140
00:10:48,199 --> 00:10:51,133
The treasure trove
goes to waste.

[sighs]

142
00:10:53,549 --> 00:10:55,309
What treasure?

143
00:10:57,311 --> 00:11:00,694
The Nazi plunder taken
from the Jews.

144
00:11:01,557 --> 00:11:03,007
What about it?

145
00:11:06,527 --> 00:11:11,015
I've kept it secret
since the war's end.

146
00:11:11,049 --> 00:11:14,570
[whooshing music]

147
00:11:14,604 --> 00:11:18,332
What good are sparkles
and glitz going to do me now

148
00:11:20,265 --> 00:11:24,442
that I am going to be dead?

149
00:11:25,546 --> 00:11:27,445
[Daciana] Now I'm interested.

150
00:11:29,378 --> 00:11:32,864
Embarrassed to admit I was
getting soft for the Jews.

151
00:11:34,452 --> 00:11:38,525
I don't care
about the fucking Nazis,

152
00:11:38,559 --> 00:11:41,252
other than their blood
was spicy.

153
00:11:46,050 --> 00:11:49,363
But I was finding myself
softened for the Jews.

154
00:11:51,434 --> 00:11:54,437
Those heartless Gestapos.

155
00:11:55,542 --> 00:11:58,407
Not that we are merciful,

156
00:11:58,441 --> 00:12:00,478
but we kill to live,

157
00:12:01,134 --> 00:12:05,863
and those Nazis wasted
good blood for sport.

158
00:12:08,693 --> 00:12:09,729
Well?

159
00:12:11,247 --> 00:12:13,284
In the castle of Wewelsburg,

160
00:12:14,216 --> 00:12:18,945
I had myself a nice feast
of some Nazi throats.

161
00:12:18,979 --> 00:12:21,568
[sighs]

162
00:12:22,638 --> 00:12:24,571
But before I killed them all,

163
00:12:24,605 --> 00:12:26,435
I heard Heinrich Himmler talk

164
00:12:26,469 --> 00:12:29,403
of the looted treasures
from the murdered Jews.

165
00:12:30,094 --> 00:12:32,234
And you know
where this treasure is?

166
00:12:32,268 --> 00:12:33,511
[laughs]

167
00:12:33,545 --> 00:12:34,995
Of course I do.

168
00:12:36,479 --> 00:12:41,588
Even the worst of beasts
will spill

169
00:12:41,622 --> 00:12:46,282

to live one more breath.

170

171
00:12:49,389 --> 00:12:51,115
Yes.

172
00:12:51,149 --> 00:12:55,188
In the canyon of caves
beyond the graves,

173
00:12:56,258 --> 00:12:58,156
before the burnt forest,

174
00:12:58,191 --> 00:13:00,918
seven kilometers southeast.

What are you writing?

177
00:13:08,201 --> 00:13:10,824
Just in case the descendants
want to find it.

178
00:13:11,549 --> 00:13:15,864
Hm.
Since when do you care
for the human?

179
00:13:17,141 --> 00:13:19,937

is thinking their last.

[creaking]

181
00:13:38,507 --> 00:13:42,683

Ah, it's psychosomatic.

Uh, no, you are definitely

in the inbreeding has created

may be too overwhelming

your stance on this,

a way to propagate the species.

551
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:36,651
Damn, what the fuck
is wrong with you?

552
00:35:36,686 --> 00:35:38,929
Why do you keep playing me
like this?

553
00:35:38,964 --> 00:35:41,656
I'm a vampire,
and, if I get too excited,

554
00:35:41,691 --> 00:35:44,314
I'm going to bite your neck
and drink your blood.

555
00:35:44,349 --> 00:35:45,729
Yep, you need a doctor.

556
00:35:46,661 --> 00:35:48,007
Chérie, I'm serious.

557
00:35:48,042 --> 00:35:50,182
I'm serious, too.

558
00:35:50,217 --> 00:35:52,564
Why do you think I have these?

559
00:35:52,598 --> 00:35:54,290
An overbite?

560
00:35:54,324 --> 00:35:56,775
Chewing too hard on your fucking
rubber baby bottle nipple

561
00:35:56,809 --> 00:35:58,121
'cause your selfish, sick mom

562
00:35:58,156 --> 00:36:00,019
wouldn't give you a soft breast?

563
00:36:00,054 --> 00:36:03,022
It was a nice day
until you ruined it.

564
00:36:03,057 --> 00:36:06,094
[percussive, emotional music]

565
00:36:21,696 --> 00:36:24,285
[traffic hums]

566
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:27,323
[soft, ominous music]

567
00:36:34,226 --> 00:36:36,746
[intercom beeping]

568
00:36:40,508 --> 00:36:43,511
[light, tinkling music]

569
00:37:01,288 --> 00:37:03,048
Oh, you can go in.

570
00:37:03,082 --> 00:37:06,120
[♪♪]

571
00:37:13,092 --> 00:37:15,267
Dr. Blood explained.

572
00:37:15,302 --> 00:37:19,202
You don't evaporate in
the sunlight, like the others?

573
00:37:19,237 --> 00:37:20,272
Yes.

574
00:37:20,893 --> 00:37:26,174
So, why carry an umbrella?

575
00:37:27,245 --> 00:37:28,660
Habit, I suppose.

576
00:37:30,248 --> 00:37:31,801
I want to say a neurosis.

577
00:37:31,835 --> 00:37:33,941
Leave it with me, on my foot.

578
00:37:37,876 --> 00:37:39,291
[Sasha] Dr. Oomious.

579
00:37:39,326 --> 00:37:42,363
[Dr. Oomious speaking
foreign language]

580
00:37:42,398 --> 00:37:44,572
[Dr. Oomious] It is me.
What is it?

581
00:37:44,607 --> 00:37:45,953
Can't you choke?

582
00:37:46,954 --> 00:37:48,611
Huh?

583
00:37:48,645 --> 00:37:53,857
Oh, only if I internalize
your suggestion,

584
00:37:53,892 --> 00:37:56,584
which, uh, I'm not gonna do.

585
00:37:58,586 --> 00:38:02,383
Oh!
So, I shall not do that.

586
00:38:02,418 --> 00:38:06,905
So, Sasha, tell me, young lady,

587
00:38:06,939 --> 00:38:09,977
what is it--
[groans]

588
00:38:10,011 --> 00:38:11,806
that you'd like to resolve?

589
00:38:11,841 --> 00:38:14,464
[Sasha] Shouldn't it be me
that lies on the couch?

590
00:38:14,499 --> 00:38:16,432
Well, if you'd rather
be a patient.

591
00:38:16,466 --> 00:38:21,575
I--I'd rather you be
a participating member
in self-discovery.

592
00:38:21,609 --> 00:38:23,577
Okay?
And, if you're hungry,

593
00:38:23,611 --> 00:38:26,096
I have more corned beef
on my desk.

594
00:38:26,131 --> 00:38:28,306
Don't tell me you're
a vegan, being a vampire.

595
00:38:29,307 --> 00:38:31,447
Ah, not a vegan, being a
vampire, I can tell.

596
00:38:31,481 --> 00:38:32,827
[chuckles]

597
00:38:32,862 --> 00:38:38,523
You have an insatiable desire
to be human?

598
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:40,179
Since a child.

599
00:38:44,252 --> 00:38:49,361
Sasha, I'm sorry to inform you,
I can't treat you.

600
00:38:50,051 --> 00:38:52,330
Why?
Am I hopeless?

601
00:38:52,364 --> 00:38:54,539
Mm, no.
[chuckles]

602
00:38:54,573 --> 00:38:56,161
Too much bleeding.

603
00:38:56,195 --> 00:38:59,302
I've been the family
psychiatrist for years

604
00:38:59,337 --> 00:39:01,649
and years and years and years.

605
00:39:01,684 --> 00:39:04,376
It's just--whoa--
quite exhausting.

606
00:39:05,135 --> 00:39:06,620
I'm not like they were.

607
00:39:06,654 --> 00:39:09,174
I have dreams of getting better.

608
00:39:09,208 --> 00:39:10,969
How pipe they all are, huh?

609
00:39:11,625 --> 00:39:14,317
As you can see,
although I'm quite hungry,
I haven't bitten you.

610
00:39:14,352 --> 00:39:16,043
[Dr. Oomious] Quite sure
of the long term effects.

611
00:39:16,077 --> 00:39:19,564
Not exactly like being bit by--
[sighs]

612
00:39:19,598 --> 00:39:21,013
A mosquito.

613
00:39:23,671 --> 00:39:26,053
You've been treating
my family for years.

614
00:39:26,087 --> 00:39:28,366
I haven't been
acting normal lately.

615
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:30,402
Can you not make
an exception for me?

616
00:39:31,196 --> 00:39:33,474
Sasha, I'm getting married soon,

617
00:39:33,509 --> 00:39:37,029
and my soon to be
desperate, barren wife

618
00:39:37,064 --> 00:39:38,237
wants to have some kids,

619
00:39:38,272 --> 00:39:39,894
and I don't want the little tots

620
00:39:39,929 --> 00:39:42,345
to become--uh--vampires,
you see?

621
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:44,416
It's not working that way.

622
00:39:44,451 --> 00:39:46,694
Well, nobody's sure.

623
00:39:47,523 --> 00:39:50,146
Well, yeah, but I'm
the last living vampire.

624
00:39:50,180 --> 00:39:51,630
There won't be any others.

625
00:39:52,182 --> 00:39:55,841
[laughs]
I'm sorry, Sasha.

626
00:39:55,876 --> 00:39:57,153
I'm sorry, honey.

627
00:39:59,120 --> 00:40:02,330
In full disclosure, Dr. Blood
has shared your charts,

628
00:40:02,365 --> 00:40:05,748
and you are, by far
and away, the most human

629
00:40:05,782 --> 00:40:08,406
of all my patients,
and now they're all,

630
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:10,580
you know,
they've all gone bye bye.

631
00:40:10,615 --> 00:40:12,030
They're all gone.

632
00:40:12,064 --> 00:40:13,583
And I'm gonna have
to get another occupation,

633
00:40:13,618 --> 00:40:14,860
which is a shame.

634
00:40:14,895 --> 00:40:17,104
But what's really
a pity is that we

635
00:40:17,138 --> 00:40:20,314
weren't able to make you
a full human.

636
00:40:21,039 --> 00:40:22,765
But it's not in God's plan.

637
00:40:22,799 --> 00:40:24,214
It's just not, honey.

638
00:40:24,249 --> 00:40:27,114
A vampire is a vampire
is a--whatever.

639
00:40:27,148 --> 00:40:28,978
You know what I mean;
a vampire is a vampire.

640
00:40:30,117 --> 00:40:31,843
Pinocchio became a real boy.

641
00:40:33,223 --> 00:40:34,708
Pinocchio?

642
00:40:34,742 --> 00:40:39,747
Sasha, but Pinocchio
had Disney on his side,

643
00:40:39,782 --> 00:40:43,751
and "I'll get you, my pretty!
[cackles]

644
00:40:43,786 --> 00:40:45,339
"Ooh, where are my monkeys?

645
00:40:45,373 --> 00:40:46,858
"Oh, the house is falling;
let's go back to Kansas!"

646
00:40:46,892 --> 00:40:48,376
[laughs]

647
00:40:48,411 --> 00:40:51,449
[ticking music]

648
00:40:53,968 --> 00:40:55,763
You didn't bite me.

649
00:40:56,523 --> 00:40:57,662
Told you.

650
00:40:58,663 --> 00:41:00,285
-Oomious?
-Yeah?

651
00:41:00,319 --> 00:41:01,597
Are you Jewish?

652
00:41:02,425 --> 00:41:04,289
I eat corned beef.
What do you think?

653
00:41:04,323 --> 00:41:05,911
[dramatic music]

654
00:41:05,946 --> 00:41:07,637
-What's that?
-It's a secret map,

655
00:41:07,672 --> 00:41:09,156
leading to the Jewish treasure

656
00:41:09,190 --> 00:41:11,330
hidden by the Nazis
during World War II.

657
00:41:11,365 --> 00:41:13,609
-Hm.
-It might take a little
sleuthing to find

658
00:41:13,643 --> 00:41:17,233
exactly where the cave is,
but if you can find it.

659
00:41:18,614 --> 00:41:19,891
Why me?

660
00:41:19,925 --> 00:41:21,306
Heritage.

661
00:41:21,340 --> 00:41:23,653
You may be even more human
than I thought.

662
00:41:28,140 --> 00:41:30,936
I just found my new occupation!

Finished my dissertation
on creative literature.

I'm going to leave
my mark on the world!

688
00:43:37,615 --> 00:43:39,271
I bet.
What the subject?

689
00:43:39,306 --> 00:43:40,479
Vampires!

690
00:43:41,411 --> 00:43:43,551
Speaking of things that suck.

00:43:43,586 --> 00:43:45,623
Boss man wants this in by five.

692
00:43:48,764 --> 00:43:49,799
Dreams.

693
00:43:50,869 --> 00:43:52,146
What about them?

694
00:43:55,184 --> 00:43:57,082
I wrote about a dream
I had last night

695
00:43:57,117 --> 00:43:59,326
where you were going
to suck my blood.

696
00:43:59,360 --> 00:44:00,948
What happened?

697
00:44:00,983 --> 00:44:03,813
You had second thoughts,
and you left.

698
00:44:03,848 --> 00:44:04,883
That's good.

699
00:44:05,712 --> 00:44:08,473
As dreams go, it was so real.

700
00:44:09,474 --> 00:44:10,751
Do you wanna read it?

701
00:44:10,786 --> 00:44:12,546
No, I went there.

702
00:44:13,443 --> 00:44:15,342
Do you wanna go to the roof?

703
00:44:15,376 --> 00:44:16,654
I don't think so.

704
00:44:16,688 --> 00:44:19,035
Come on!
I got something to tell you.

705
00:44:23,212 --> 00:44:25,939
Tequila, tequila, tequila.

706
00:44:25,973 --> 00:44:28,976
[soft, jaunty piano music]

707
00:44:36,156 --> 00:44:38,330
So what it is you want
to tell me?

708
00:44:38,365 --> 00:44:40,194
Shut up and drink.

709
00:44:48,478 --> 00:44:50,032
Mm.

710
00:44:50,066 --> 00:44:51,965
That feels good.

711
00:44:51,999 --> 00:44:54,001
Might even be better
than blood?

713
00:45:21,132 --> 00:45:23,030
[Sasha] I'm sorry, Chérie,
I can't.

714
00:45:23,065 --> 00:45:24,722
I know, because you didn't.

715
00:45:25,412 --> 00:45:27,207
We will get fired.

716
00:45:27,241 --> 00:45:29,002
We're on top of the world,
girl.

717
00:45:29,036 --> 00:45:31,280
No one can fire us;
we fire them!

718
00:45:32,315 --> 00:45:35,180
You were right there,
at the edge of my bed,

719
00:45:35,215 --> 00:45:39,288
hungry, desperate to drink
my blood, but you didn't.

720
00:45:40,392 --> 00:45:41,877
It was only a dream.

00:45:44,086 --> 00:45:45,743
No, it wasn't.

00:45:46,778 --> 00:45:49,056
My God.
You know!

You smell so, so good.
Mm!

You're so pretty.

Oh, you're super cool.

You're both fired.

See what you made us do?

745
00:46:41,522 --> 00:46:43,248
You made us drink
the whole bottle,

746
00:46:43,283 --> 00:46:44,836
and now there's none left.

747
00:46:45,768 --> 00:46:47,632

Sasha's right.
You're fired.

And Chérie, she doesn't
need this stupid job.

751
00:46:57,469 --> 00:47:00,921
She's going to be famous
on her literature.

752
00:47:00,956 --> 00:47:05,339
It's a book on dreams
and wins the Pulitzer Prize,

753
00:47:05,374 --> 00:47:07,617
and you suck.

754

bite your neck.

911
00:57:48,085 --> 00:57:49,362
Where'd you find her?

912
00:57:50,259 --> 00:57:51,398
My rose bed.

913
00:57:52,434 --> 00:57:56,093
Wait, in your garden
of vampire stakes?

914
00:57:56,127 --> 00:57:59,406
Hey, I buried my dog
in that garden.

915
00:57:59,441 --> 00:58:01,408
Okay.
Where's this going?

916
00:58:01,443 --> 00:58:03,997
I'm just saying,
stay out of my garden.

917
00:58:06,690 --> 00:58:08,070
Why would she leave it?

918
00:58:08,968 --> 00:58:10,832
[Holmes] Cry for help?

919
00:58:10,866 --> 00:58:12,316
Oh, I'll help her.

920
00:58:12,350 --> 00:58:13,697
[laughs]

921
00:58:14,283 --> 00:58:15,699
She's a looker.

922
00:58:17,045 --> 00:58:20,255
[snorts] This is official
police business, okay, man?

923
00:58:20,289 --> 00:58:22,947
Not your little...porn play.

924
00:58:22,982 --> 00:58:24,639
I'm not saying anything,
all right?

925
00:58:24,673 --> 00:58:26,330
Cut me some slack.

926
00:58:26,364 --> 00:58:29,885
Just saying she's, uh,
mysterious is all.

927
00:58:32,647 --> 00:58:36,513
Junior, best watch yourself,
all right?

928
00:58:36,927 --> 00:58:38,515
You'll find yourself
the next victim.

929
00:58:40,551 --> 00:58:43,554
[♪♪]

930
00:58:51,148 --> 00:58:53,909
[traffic hums]

931
00:58:54,738 --> 00:58:56,084
[Holmes and Junior chatter]

932
00:58:56,118 --> 00:58:57,534
[Holmes] See what it says.

933
00:58:57,568 --> 00:58:58,983
[Junior] Sweet Sin Drive.

934
00:58:59,018 --> 00:59:01,468
Uh, I think it is...

935
00:59:14,551 --> 00:59:16,173
What is this?

936
00:59:16,207 --> 00:59:18,555
In case folklore
isn't folklore.

937
00:59:19,348 --> 00:59:20,557
Come on.

938
00:59:24,112 --> 00:59:25,700
Come on.

939
00:59:25,734 --> 00:59:28,737
[comical music]

940
00:59:39,610 --> 00:59:41,578
[doorbell rings]

941
00:59:44,822 --> 00:59:46,859
[groovy percussion music]

942
00:59:46,893 --> 00:59:49,344
[doorbell ringing]

943
00:59:51,898 --> 00:59:53,348
Afternoon, Miss.

944
00:59:53,382 --> 00:59:54,901
Detective Holmes,
Officer Junior.

945
00:59:54,936 --> 00:59:56,316
May we come in?

946
00:59:56,351 --> 00:59:58,595
-[Sasha] Why?
-You are a person of interest.

947
00:59:58,629 --> 01:00:01,736
[Sasha] 'Kay, and why I am
a person of interest for?

948
01:00:01,770 --> 01:00:03,979
-Does this look familiar?
-[Sasha] My license.

949
01:00:04,014 --> 01:00:07,293
-How did you get it?
-You left it in my rose garden.

950
01:00:07,327 --> 01:00:09,433
[Sasha] Oh, the one
with the vampire stakes?

951
01:00:10,468 --> 01:00:11,608
Yeah.

952
01:00:13,092 --> 01:00:15,094
[whistles]
Nice place.

953
01:00:15,612 --> 01:00:16,889
-Thank you.
-[Holmes] Oh.

954
01:00:16,923 --> 01:00:18,476
You can see
the observatory from here.

955
01:00:19,512 --> 01:00:20,893
Please, have a seat.

956
01:00:20,927 --> 01:00:23,965
[♪♪]

957
01:00:32,490 --> 01:00:34,389
Is he okay?

958
01:00:36,771 --> 01:00:39,014
Junior's just never seen
a vampire before.

959
01:00:39,843 --> 01:00:41,638
Well, if you've seen one,
you've seen them all.

960
01:00:41,672 --> 01:00:43,225
[Holmes chuckles]

961
01:00:43,260 --> 01:00:44,641
[Junior chuckles]

962
01:00:46,332 --> 01:00:48,023
There's been multiple murders.

963
01:00:48,058 --> 01:00:50,923
One of your doctors
as well as your boss.

964
01:00:50,957 --> 01:00:52,131
That's so sad.

965
01:00:54,996 --> 01:00:56,549
Do you wanna confess?

966
01:00:58,862 --> 01:01:00,518
Sure.
How do I do that?

967
01:01:00,553 --> 01:01:03,556
You'll sign a confession
admitting to the murders?

968
01:01:04,453 --> 01:01:05,938
Well, I'm not sure.

969
01:01:05,972 --> 01:01:07,664
I've been having blackouts.

970
01:01:08,906 --> 01:01:10,390
I'm sorry, Miss,
we're gonna need

971
01:01:10,425 --> 01:01:13,670
to put this mask
over your mouth for precaution.

972
01:01:14,878 --> 01:01:16,465
Precaution for what?

973
01:01:16,500 --> 01:01:17,674
Just do it.

974
01:01:20,504 --> 01:01:22,989
If it were up to me,
I wouldn't.

975
01:01:23,714 --> 01:01:24,957
It's okay, Junior.

976
01:01:25,682 --> 01:01:28,029
[Holmes] You're right, Junior,
it's not up to you.

977
01:01:28,063 --> 01:01:29,375
Put it on.

978
01:01:29,409 --> 01:01:32,447
[♪♪]

979
01:01:43,044 --> 01:01:44,355
You have nice hair.

980
01:01:44,390 --> 01:01:45,840
Sit down, Junior.

981
01:01:47,082 --> 01:01:48,566
[Sasha] I will talk
to not anyone else.

982
01:01:48,601 --> 01:01:50,051
Please, arrest me.

983
01:01:50,085 --> 01:01:51,638
Then you're admitting
to the murders.

984
01:01:51,673 --> 01:01:53,399
[Sasha] I just don't remember.

985
01:01:54,124 --> 01:01:56,678
[sighs] Well, can't
arrest you on suspicion.

986
01:01:56,713 --> 01:01:59,785
We'll have to leave it at that,
see what the evidence reveals.

987
01:01:59,819 --> 01:02:02,580
Look, here's my card,
in case you wanna get coffee
or something like-

988
01:02:02,615 --> 01:02:05,204
Don't listen to the rookie.

989
01:02:05,238 --> 01:02:07,378
He's still learning how to talk.
Go to the car.

990
01:02:11,624 --> 01:02:14,661
[light music]

991
01:02:15,386 --> 01:02:16,733
[Sasha] You want your mask back?

992
01:02:16,767 --> 01:02:18,562
[Holmes] I may need it
for the next one.

993
01:02:18,596 --> 01:02:20,150
[Sasha] I'm the last of them.

994
01:02:20,184 --> 01:02:23,222
[♪♪]

995
01:02:39,376 --> 01:02:40,757
Have a good day, Miss.

996
01:02:42,620 --> 01:02:44,346
Can I have my license back?

997
01:02:46,417 --> 01:02:48,109
Sorry, it's evidence.

998
01:02:48,143 --> 01:02:51,146
[tinkling, soft music]

999
01:02:55,599 --> 01:02:57,774
Detective Holmes,

1000
01:02:57,808 --> 01:03:00,500
if the evidence reveals
I'm the murderer,

1001
01:03:00,535 --> 01:03:03,365
please kill me,
and don't hesitate.

1002
01:03:05,091 --> 01:03:06,127
Copy that.

1003
01:03:06,161 --> 01:03:09,164
[soft, shimmering music]

1004
01:03:19,174 --> 01:03:20,900
You think she did it?

1005
01:03:20,935 --> 01:03:22,005
I don't know.

1006
01:03:22,039 --> 01:03:23,800
[engine turns over]

1007
01:03:23,834 --> 01:03:25,698
She got to you, too,
didn't she?

1008
01:03:26,768 --> 01:03:28,977
Don't let your dick get
in the way of your gun.

1009
01:03:29,875 --> 01:03:31,117

[♪♪]

1016
01:04:06,635 --> 01:04:08,051
Officer Junior.

1017
01:04:09,431 --> 01:04:11,157
Wanna join me for some coffee?

1018
01:04:12,089 --> 01:04:14,160
Wouldn't it be
against protocol?

1019
01:04:17,439 --> 01:04:20,063
Isn't being a vampire
against protocol?

1020
01:04:20,097 --> 01:04:23,100
[soft music]

1021
01:04:26,276 --> 01:04:28,692
It's a really nice night
out tonight.

1022
01:04:28,726 --> 01:04:31,246
Yes, if you're a vampire.

1023
01:04:35,492 --> 01:04:36,803
[clears throat]

1024
01:04:36,838 --> 01:04:38,357
Excuse me, Miss,
would you mind, uh,

1025
01:04:38,391 --> 01:04:40,773
opening your mouth
and showing me your teeth?

1026
01:04:41,947 --> 01:04:43,880
[Sasha growls softly]

1027
01:04:44,777 --> 01:04:48,056
Oh, you really are a vampire.

1028
01:04:48,091 --> 01:04:49,437
Could be an overbite.

1029
01:04:50,887 --> 01:04:52,405
But is it?

1030
01:04:53,890 --> 01:04:56,030
I thought it was
a coffee date.

1031
01:04:57,376 --> 01:04:58,722
So it is a date.

1032
01:04:59,378 --> 01:05:01,069
Depends.

1033
01:05:01,104 --> 01:05:03,727
Is it a social meet
or police business?

1034
01:05:04,659 --> 01:05:09,560
I'd say it, uh, feels a lot less
like business and more social.

1035
01:05:09,595 --> 01:05:11,597
Looks can be deceiving.

1036
01:05:11,631 --> 01:05:14,669
[gentle guitar music]

1037
01:05:20,813 --> 01:05:21,987
I wanna kiss you.

1038
01:05:24,265 --> 01:05:26,163
Want to or need to?

1039
01:05:27,993 --> 01:05:29,580
And risk being bitten?

1040
01:05:36,415 --> 01:05:37,795
You are a vampire?

1041
01:05:37,830 --> 01:05:40,074
[laughs]

1042
01:05:40,108 --> 01:05:41,938
I'm just fucking with you.

Geez, can't women take
a joke anymore?

1046
01:05:48,427 --> 01:05:50,463
Tell me about it, dude.

1047
01:05:50,498 --> 01:05:53,535
[soft music continues]

01:05:59,093 --> 01:06:01,992

[wolves howling]

1057
01:06:40,479 --> 01:06:42,170
[Sasha] Yes, yes.

[light music]

1060
01:06:49,212 --> 01:06:51,007
Gas gauge is near empty.

1061
01:06:52,974 --> 01:06:55,735
Wasn't like that
when we clocked out last night.

1062
01:06:57,185 --> 01:07:00,188
Maybe the vampires decided
to drink gas instead of blood.

1063
01:07:00,223 --> 01:07:02,087
[chuckles]
Conservation.

1064
01:07:04,675 --> 01:07:06,574
[Holmes] Very funny.

1065
01:07:06,608 --> 01:07:08,334
Did you take the rig out
last night?

1066
01:07:09,094 --> 01:07:11,993
Uh, yeah, went for a drive,
you know,

1067
01:07:12,028 --> 01:07:13,857
with the cool wind in my hair.

1068
01:07:13,891 --> 01:07:16,446
Thought I'd stop at Hotel Callie
for some action.

1069
01:07:22,107 --> 01:07:23,798
Very good.

1070
01:07:23,832 --> 01:07:25,627
You opening for Leno now?

1071
01:07:25,662 --> 01:07:28,699
[♪♪]

1072
01:07:30,908 --> 01:07:32,082
Rough shave?

1073
01:07:33,256 --> 01:07:35,327
Uh, hickey.
[chuckles]

1074
01:07:35,361 --> 01:07:36,466
[scoffs]

1075
01:07:36,500 --> 01:07:37,708
Let me see it.

1076
01:07:38,606 --> 01:07:40,090
What do you care
about my hickey?

1077
01:07:40,125 --> 01:07:42,472
-Come on, let me see.
-No, get outta here.

1078
01:07:42,506 --> 01:07:44,060
Ow!

1079
01:07:44,094 --> 01:07:46,165
-It is a hickey.
-Yeah.

1080
01:07:46,200 --> 01:07:47,373
Cute.

1081
01:07:48,961 --> 01:07:53,172
God, you know, you got
no trust in me lately.

1082
01:07:53,207 --> 01:07:55,071
Well, lately, you
haven't been delivering.

1083
01:07:56,658 --> 01:07:58,143
That's not what she said.

1084
01:07:58,971 --> 01:08:00,421
Consider yourself lucky.

1085
01:08:01,284 --> 01:08:02,871
About what?

1086
01:08:02,906 --> 01:08:04,839
The only thing she
gave you was a hickey.

1087
01:08:05,771 --> 01:08:07,842
Wouldn't want those fangs
near my stake.

1088
01:08:09,050 --> 01:08:11,397
Look, I deliver, okay?

1089
01:08:11,432 --> 01:08:13,192
I extracted some info.

1090
01:08:13,227 --> 01:08:16,678
Apparently, there's a shit load
of treasure involved.

1091
01:08:16,713 --> 01:08:19,405
[dramatic music]

1092
01:08:19,440 --> 01:08:22,028
[traffic hums]

1093
01:08:22,063 --> 01:08:24,962
[siren wails]

1094
01:08:30,658 --> 01:08:33,868
Shit! I had no idea
what kind of shit load.

1095
01:08:35,352 --> 01:08:37,320
[gas nozzle rattles]

1096
01:08:48,158 --> 01:08:49,642
Watching porn again, slick?

1097
01:08:52,956 --> 01:08:55,648
So, do you remember that info
I was telling you about?

1098
01:08:55,683 --> 01:08:58,272
Apparently, the Nazis
stashed billions

1099
01:08:58,306 --> 01:09:00,860
of the Jews' treasure
in some cave.

1100
01:09:00,895 --> 01:09:02,414
[Holmes] Ole Miss Hickey
tell you that?

1101
01:09:02,448 --> 01:09:04,485
Yeah, yeah,
said she had the map,

1102
01:09:04,519 --> 01:09:05,796
but she gave it to one

1103
01:09:05,831 --> 01:09:08,144
of the victims
who was later murdered.

1104
01:09:08,178 --> 01:09:10,284
Let me guess,
blood sucked out.

1105
01:09:10,318 --> 01:09:11,526
Yeah, murdered.

1106
01:09:11,561 --> 01:09:13,079
[engine turns over]

1107
01:09:13,114 --> 01:09:15,081
Hm.

1108
01:09:15,116 --> 01:09:18,568
So, uh, where'd she find
the map?

1109
01:09:18,602 --> 01:09:19,983
Some relative.

1110
01:09:20,880 --> 01:09:22,123
So let me get this straight.

1111
01:09:22,158 --> 01:09:23,607
There's...
[clears throat]

1112
01:09:23,642 --> 01:09:26,645
A murderer that's looking
for hidden treasure.

1113
01:09:26,679 --> 01:09:27,991
[Junior] Yeah.

1114
01:09:28,025 --> 01:09:29,924
Gonna be one rich son
of a bitch.

1115
01:09:30,821 --> 01:09:33,203
[Holmes]
Did your little fang fatale

1116
01:09:33,238 --> 01:09:34,618
tell you that she's
the last one,

1117
01:09:34,653 --> 01:09:36,241
that all the other ones
are dead?

1118
01:09:37,242 --> 01:09:38,519
The last of who?

1119
01:09:40,900 --> 01:09:42,454
The last of the vampires.

1120
01:09:42,488 --> 01:09:44,110
[chuckles]

1121
01:09:44,145 --> 01:09:46,492
Yeah, yeah,
she told me that.

1122
01:09:46,527 --> 01:09:48,598
Like I'm gonna believe
that wild stuff.

1123
01:09:49,426 --> 01:09:51,325
And that the treasure's
in a cave

1124
01:09:52,015 --> 01:09:54,397
in the mountains
of Transylvania?

1125
01:09:54,431 --> 01:09:57,331
Wait, wait, how do
you know what she said?

1126
01:09:59,712 --> 01:10:00,920
Check your pocket.

1127
01:10:07,686 --> 01:10:09,860
Oh, you son of a bitch.

1128
01:10:09,895 --> 01:10:11,310
[dark music]

1129
01:10:11,345 --> 01:10:14,175
You know--look who can't
be trusted now, huh?

1130
01:10:14,210 --> 01:10:17,247
This is also against my privacy
and it's against the law.

1131
01:10:17,282 --> 01:10:18,904
Tell Internal Affairs.

1132
01:10:19,698 --> 01:10:21,113
You know, while you're at it,

1133
01:10:21,147 --> 01:10:23,080
tell them you are now
a person of interest

1134
01:10:23,115 --> 01:10:25,082
because you're sleeping
with the suspect.

1135
01:10:26,083 --> 01:10:27,947
Since when is she a suspect?

1136
01:10:27,982 --> 01:10:31,261
Since all the victims
have vampire bites,

1137
01:10:31,296 --> 01:10:33,229
and she's the last vampire.

1138
01:10:35,092 --> 01:10:38,130
A--vampire bats.

1139
01:10:38,164 --> 01:10:41,547
[Holmes] Yeah, how do you know?
Did you see the forensics?

1140
01:10:41,582 --> 01:10:45,517
Anyway, the other kind
are folklore.

1141
01:10:45,551 --> 01:10:47,208
Yeah, I used to think so.

1142
01:10:47,243 --> 01:10:48,796
I'm not too sure anymore.

1143
01:10:49,797 --> 01:10:51,626
Mind if I tell
Internal Affairs?

1144
01:10:51,661 --> 01:10:54,146
[scoffs]
They'd lock us both up.

1145
01:10:57,701 --> 01:10:59,013
Hungry, slick?

1146
01:10:59,047 --> 01:11:00,083
[Junior] Yeah.

1147
01:11:00,117 --> 01:11:02,948
[Holmes] Let us eat, hm?

1148
01:11:06,227 --> 01:11:07,849
[engine turns off]

1149
01:11:09,092 --> 01:11:10,611
[Holmes grunts]

1150
01:11:11,128 --> 01:11:12,371
[upbeat music]

1151
01:11:12,406 --> 01:11:13,407
[bottle clanks]

1152
01:11:13,441 --> 01:11:14,649
Sandwiches?

1153
01:11:17,169 --> 01:11:18,895
I could really use a beer
with these.

1154
01:11:18,929 --> 01:11:21,173
Ask and you shall receive.

1155
01:11:21,622 --> 01:11:23,762
Holy shit.

1156
01:11:23,796 --> 01:11:25,281
[bottle opens]

1157
01:11:25,315 --> 01:11:27,800
Can't we get in trouble
for drinking in the car?

1158
01:11:27,835 --> 01:11:29,285
We're two cops.

1159
01:11:30,078 --> 01:11:31,321
Breaking the law.

1160
01:11:32,322 --> 01:11:34,393
I won't tell
if you won't tell.

1161
01:11:34,428 --> 01:11:35,394
I ain't saying nothing.

1162
01:11:35,429 --> 01:11:36,775
[bottle opens]

1163
01:11:36,809 --> 01:11:38,363
Here's to nabbing a suspect.

1164
01:11:41,331 --> 01:11:45,784
Say, uh, how far would you go
in breaking the law?

1165
01:11:46,785 --> 01:11:48,304
Meaning?

1166
01:11:48,338 --> 01:11:52,308
Meaning if we 
dig up the treasure...

1167
01:11:53,619 --> 01:11:56,035
What's the harm in sharing some?

1168
01:11:56,070 --> 01:11:58,659
Sure, we'll just fly out
to Transylvania.

1169
01:12:00,626 --> 01:12:03,146
You were listening.
You heard it.

1170
01:12:06,218 --> 01:12:07,944
Mm.

1171
01:12:07,978 --> 01:12:10,429
As soon as you were
about to climax, I stopped.

1172
01:12:10,464 --> 01:12:13,501
I mean, I don't need
to hear you finish, ugh.

1173
01:12:14,019 --> 01:12:15,400
Thanks for the respect.

1174
01:12:17,747 --> 01:12:18,782
So what did she say?

1175
01:12:18,817 --> 01:12:19,956
[ethereal music]

1176
01:12:19,990 --> 01:12:23,718
Oh!
Look who's in control now.

1177
01:12:24,547 --> 01:12:27,066
The treasure's not
in Transylvania any longer.

1178
01:12:30,898 --> 01:12:33,141
Where's the treasure, shithead?

1179
01:12:33,176 --> 01:12:35,696
Whoa!
Take it easy.

1180
01:12:36,386 --> 01:12:38,284
So, we gonna split it?

1181
01:12:38,319 --> 01:12:41,460
Not unless I split your
dumbass head open first.

1182
01:12:41,495 --> 01:12:43,669
And what about respect
for the Jews?

1183
01:12:43,704 --> 01:12:45,188
[dark music]

1184
01:12:45,222 --> 01:12:47,811
We're not gonna take it all,
just a percentage,

1185
01:12:47,846 --> 01:12:49,365
for our inconvenience.

1186
01:12:50,849 --> 01:12:51,988
Now you're talking.

1187
01:12:52,022 --> 01:12:53,714
I'll cheers to that.
Let's go.

1188
01:12:55,025 --> 01:12:57,545
I just started
my fucking sandwich.

1189
01:12:57,580 --> 01:12:59,444
Well, I'm hungry
for treasure now.

1190
01:13:01,342 --> 01:13:02,412
Eat your sandwich.

1191
01:13:02,447 --> 01:13:03,586
Thank you.

1192
01:13:08,522 --> 01:13:09,730
[insects chirrup]

1193
01:13:09,764 --> 01:13:11,179
[wolves howling]

1194
01:13:11,214 --> 01:13:13,389
[owl hoots]

1195
01:13:14,459 --> 01:13:16,426
[Junior] I don't even
wanna know what's in there.

1196
01:13:17,462 --> 01:13:19,533
Yeah, let's just skip by that.

1197
01:13:21,638 --> 01:13:23,640
[Holmes] Are those coffins
or cabinets?

1198
01:13:24,779 --> 01:13:26,263
[Junior] I don't like them
either way.

1199
01:13:28,749 --> 01:13:31,268
[Holmes] All this time,
I thought it was folklore.

1200
01:13:32,166 --> 01:13:34,893
[Junior] I just hope
the treasure ain't folklore.

1201
01:13:34,927 --> 01:13:36,860
[Holmes] I don't get
the Count thing.

1202
01:13:36,895 --> 01:13:38,897
Dracula set a precedent
or something?

1203
01:13:40,657 --> 01:13:45,593
Why not Baron, Duke, Earl,
or Marquis?

1204
01:13:45,628 --> 01:13:47,043
[dog barking]

1205
01:13:47,077 --> 01:13:48,493
[Junior] It's tradition.

1206
01:13:49,597 --> 01:13:51,116
Yeah, well detective
tradition's telling me

1207
01:13:51,150 --> 01:13:52,220
that something ain't right.

1208
01:13:52,255 --> 01:13:53,739
It's not an amusement park.

1209
01:13:53,774 --> 01:13:54,913
It's a graveyard.

1210
01:13:54,947 --> 01:13:56,052
Look, suck it up, okay?

1211
01:13:56,086 --> 01:13:57,536
We're about to be rich.

1212
01:13:57,571 --> 01:13:58,606
[Holmes] Which grave?

1213
01:13:58,641 --> 01:14:00,125
How am I supposed to know?

1214
01:14:01,471 --> 01:14:04,681
[Holmes] Hey, you didn't tell
anyone about this, did you?

1215
01:14:04,716 --> 01:14:05,855
No.

1216
01:14:09,134 --> 01:14:11,308
-Except Connor.
-What the fuck?

1217
01:14:11,343 --> 01:14:13,932
You told that creepy klepto
we were out here?

1218
01:14:13,966 --> 01:14:15,312
He didn't believe me.

1219
01:14:16,279 --> 01:14:18,592
Right.
Who would?

1220
01:14:20,283 --> 01:14:21,905
Gotta calm down.

1221
01:14:21,940 --> 01:14:24,943
[ominous music]

1222
01:14:24,977 --> 01:14:26,703
What am I even looking for?

1223
01:14:28,774 --> 01:14:30,500
[Junior] I don't know.
Just stay calm.

1224
01:14:30,535 --> 01:14:33,538
[soft, suspenseful music]

1225
01:14:37,783 --> 01:14:38,957
Found it.

1226
01:14:40,855 --> 01:14:42,339
How do you know?

1227
01:14:42,374 --> 01:14:43,789
Fresh prints and dirt.

1228
01:14:46,516 --> 01:14:48,000
Nice work, Junior.

1229
01:14:48,035 --> 01:14:50,037
[dog barking]

1230
01:14:50,071 --> 01:14:53,143
So, when do we tell
the department?

1231
01:14:53,178 --> 01:14:55,491
Let's see what we've got first.

1232
01:14:55,525 --> 01:14:56,975
After we take our share?

1233
01:14:57,354 --> 01:14:59,184
Shh.
Just dig.

1234
01:14:59,667 --> 01:15:00,979
All right.

1235
01:15:04,016 --> 01:15:05,949
[shovel crunches]

1236
01:15:05,984 --> 01:15:09,021
[♪♪]

1237
01:15:15,338 --> 01:15:17,651
[object jangles]

1238
01:15:28,316 --> 01:15:30,111
[Junior] Shit, look at that.

1239
01:15:30,146 --> 01:15:31,527
Is that real gold?

1240
01:15:35,392 --> 01:15:36,739
There's an inscription.

1241
01:15:37,912 --> 01:15:40,501
"To my beloved Anna.

1242
01:15:40,536 --> 01:15:42,192
"I will love you all eternity.

1243
01:15:42,227 --> 01:15:46,300
"Max, 1935."

1244
01:15:49,372 --> 01:15:50,787
That's really sad.

1245
01:15:54,515 --> 01:15:56,034
Whoa, dude, what the fuck?

1246
01:15:57,345 --> 01:15:58,899
You can't just wear that.

1247
01:15:58,933 --> 01:16:00,038
What am I supposed
to do with it,

1248
01:16:00,072 --> 01:16:01,833
throw it back in the cold dirt?

1249
01:16:01,867 --> 01:16:03,697
Don't throw a fit.

1250
01:16:04,732 --> 01:16:06,700
Holy shit!

1251
01:16:09,703 --> 01:16:11,946
Look at this.
It's the matching ring.

1252
01:16:13,051 --> 01:16:15,122
"To my beloved Max.

1253
01:16:15,156 --> 01:16:16,744
"I will love you
for all eternity.

1254
01:16:16,779 --> 01:16:19,298
"Anna, 1935."

1255
01:16:23,130 --> 01:16:25,063
All right, no more digging.

1256
01:16:26,478 --> 01:16:28,584
Oh, don't throw a fit.

1257
01:16:28,618 --> 01:16:30,275
Look, how about this, okay?

1258
01:16:31,379 --> 01:16:33,105
[rings jangle]

1259
01:16:34,659 --> 01:16:36,971
And now they're together again.

1260
01:16:37,731 --> 01:16:39,456
[Holmes] We're leaving.
Come on.

1261
01:16:40,216 --> 01:16:41,597
Don't be a bitch, okay?

1262
01:16:41,631 --> 01:16:43,219
Just 'cause I put on the rings,

1263
01:16:43,253 --> 01:16:44,634
we're gonna forego the treasure?

1264
01:16:44,669 --> 01:16:46,118
[Holmes] Some things are sacred.

1265
01:16:46,981 --> 01:16:48,500
Where's our dignity, huh?

1266
01:16:50,295 --> 01:16:52,435
Those rings belonged
to a man and wife

1267
01:16:52,469 --> 01:16:54,057
who loved each other dearly,

1268
01:16:54,092 --> 01:16:58,027
and they were murdered
mercilessly by human animals.

1269
01:17:00,823 --> 01:17:05,172
This treasure belongs to the
deceased and their ancestors.

1270
01:17:07,036 --> 01:17:10,522
That could've been us,
murdered in cold blood.

1271
01:17:11,834 --> 01:17:13,905
No, we're done here, man.

1272
01:17:13,939 --> 01:17:15,113
I'm calling it in.

1273
01:17:18,185 --> 01:17:19,807
[Holmes sighs]

1274
01:17:19,842 --> 01:17:21,153
Easy come, easy go.

1275
01:17:23,362 --> 01:17:25,123
[rings jangle]

1276
01:17:25,157 --> 01:17:28,160
[soft, emotional music]

1277
01:17:31,854 --> 01:17:33,994
-[gun clicks]
-Pick the shovel back up.

1278
01:17:34,028 --> 01:17:37,031
[tense music]

1279
01:17:37,894 --> 01:17:39,551
I thought you didn't believe me.

1280
01:17:39,585 --> 01:17:42,071
You believed me.
I didn't believe you, stupid-o.

1281
01:17:42,105 --> 01:17:43,520
Dig.

1282
01:17:43,555 --> 01:17:46,662
[♪♪]

1283
01:17:48,008 --> 01:17:50,527
No, this stuff belongs
to the sacrificed Jews.

1284
01:17:50,562 --> 01:17:52,357
Yeah, and when you dig up
the loot,

1285
01:17:52,391 --> 01:17:55,256
I'm gonna sacrifice you
and bury you in the grave, so.

1286
01:17:58,915 --> 01:18:01,331
Why would we dig
if you're just gonna kill us?

1287
01:18:03,886 --> 01:18:05,266
Buy yourself some time.

1288
01:18:07,165 --> 01:18:08,338
Dig.

1289
01:18:10,547 --> 01:18:11,859
Hands where I can see them.

1290
01:18:11,894 --> 01:18:13,274
While I figure out how
to take down

1291
01:18:13,309 --> 01:18:16,243
this money-hungry, bad cop.

1292
01:18:17,969 --> 01:18:19,384
Guns.

1293
01:18:19,418 --> 01:18:22,456

-[gun bangs]
-[Holmes grunts]

1295
01:18:27,944 --> 01:18:29,877
I said Junior dig, not you!

1296
01:18:29,912 --> 01:18:31,741
Junior, dig,
or I'll shoot you in the leg

1297
01:18:31,776 --> 01:18:33,018
and force you to dig anyway

1298
01:18:33,053 --> 01:18:34,951
while experiencing
excruciating pain.

1299
01:18:35,780 --> 01:18:37,333
[Junior] One bullet
might have been loud enough

1300
01:18:37,367 --> 01:18:40,577
to alert some dog walker
nearby to call the cops.

1301
01:18:40,612 --> 01:18:42,579
Another bullet will surely seal
your fate.

1302
01:18:42,614 --> 01:18:44,271
-[gun bangs]
-Dig!

1303
01:18:44,305 --> 01:18:45,859
Or I'll shoot you in the arm
anyway, and force you

1304
01:18:45,893 --> 01:18:48,137
to dig in double
excruciating pain.

1305
01:18:50,898 --> 01:18:52,866
You're as bad
as the fucking Nazis!

1306
01:18:52,900 --> 01:18:54,557
Yeah, well,
not exactly my heroes,

1307
01:18:54,591 --> 01:18:56,110
but I'll take it
as I'm a bad ass.

1308
01:18:56,145 --> 01:18:57,940
-[gun bangs]
-[Junior groans]

1309
01:19:00,770 --> 01:19:02,841
The more blood you spill
from me,

1310
01:19:02,876 --> 01:19:04,394
the more I stand unified
with the martyrs.

1311
01:19:04,429 --> 01:19:06,086
[gun bangs]

1312
01:19:06,120 --> 01:19:07,846
[Connor] You don't stand.
You're lying next to the filth.

1313
01:19:07,881 --> 01:19:09,261
Leave him the fuck alone!

1314
01:19:09,296 --> 01:19:10,711

Get up, get up!

1319
01:19:21,515 --> 01:19:23,413
You know where this next
deadly bullet will go?

1320
01:19:23,448 --> 01:19:25,105
To the part
of your brain housing

1321
01:19:25,139 --> 01:19:26,934
the wild idea of compassion.

1322
01:19:28,246 --> 01:19:30,213
The sound of your evil chant

1323
01:19:30,248 --> 01:19:32,043
will be heard beyond the human.

1324
01:19:32,077 --> 01:19:34,045
Oh, yeah?

1325
01:19:34,079 --> 01:19:35,874
Like God saved the Jews?

1326
01:19:35,909 --> 01:19:39,084
[Connor laughing]

1327
01:19:42,743 --> 01:19:44,400

[Junior] Oh, thank God.

1334
01:20:02,038 --> 01:20:03,557
Who are you?

1335
01:20:03,591 --> 01:20:05,110
[chuckles]

1336
01:20:05,145 --> 01:20:07,768
Dr. Blood.
[chuckles]

1337
01:20:07,803 --> 01:20:10,840
Hey, look, come--come get my
cellphone out of my pocket.

1338
01:20:10,875 --> 01:20:12,462
We can call Central.

1339
01:20:12,497 --> 01:20:15,534
[tense music]

1340
01:20:19,987 --> 01:20:22,403
Huh.
[Dr. Blood chuckles]

1341
01:20:27,892 --> 01:20:29,169

01:20:29,203 --> 01:20:32,206
[discordant music]

1343
01:20:32,862 --> 01:20:34,519
What--what are you doing?

1344
01:20:36,003 --> 01:20:38,316
Wait, why'd you do that?

1345
01:20:38,350 --> 01:20:40,111
[Dr. Blood chuckles]

1346
01:20:40,145 --> 01:20:41,802
Oh, you've gotta be kidding me?

1347
01:20:41,837 --> 01:20:43,355
I have no sense of humor.

1348
01:20:43,390 --> 01:20:45,185
That's why I laugh at all
the wrong places.

1349
01:20:45,219 --> 01:20:46,772
[chuckles]

1350
01:20:46,807 --> 01:20:48,878
But Detective Connor
had the right idea,

1351
01:20:48,913 --> 01:20:51,122
except he's not gonna be
the last one standing.

1352
01:20:51,156 --> 01:20:53,124
[chuckles]

1353
01:20:53,158 --> 01:20:54,677
Why are you doing this?

1354
01:20:54,711 --> 01:20:56,886
Well, why does anyone
do anything?

1355
01:20:56,921 --> 01:20:58,060
Why not?

1356
01:20:58,094 --> 01:20:59,682
[chuckles]

1357
01:20:59,716 --> 01:21:01,615
Look, the treasure
is right there, okay?

1358
01:21:01,649 --> 01:21:03,030
Just take it.

1359
01:21:03,065 --> 01:21:05,136
Of course I'm gonna
take your treasure,

1360
01:21:05,170 --> 01:21:07,207
and them I'm gonna
suck your blood.

1361
01:21:07,241 --> 01:21:08,691

1362
01:21:08,725 --> 01:21:10,658
Oh, fuck--fuck this.

[Dr. Blood grunts]

1364
01:21:15,077 --> 01:21:17,010
[Junior] What the fuck?

1365
01:21:19,081 --> 01:21:21,117
[Dr. Blood laughs]

1366
01:21:28,021 --> 01:21:29,850
My trademark!

1367
01:21:29,885 --> 01:21:32,059
Aw, you're a fucking sicko!

1368
01:21:32,094 --> 01:21:33,889
Well, maybe you think
I'm a sicko,

1369
01:21:33,923 --> 01:21:36,098
but this is a lifelong dream.

1370
01:21:36,132 --> 01:21:37,996
Now, where do you want it,
left or right?

1371

-Huh?

Oh, no, you don't.

[Junior] I thought you
weren't the flying kind.

1386
01:22:35,122 --> 01:22:37,124
[Sasha] I didn't know
until now.

1387

Maybe you can teach us how
to fly like that someday?

1397
01:23:16,853 --> 01:23:18,407
Full report, boss.

1398
01:23:21,065 --> 01:23:22,652
Just give me the meat
and bones, kid.

1399
01:23:22,687 --> 01:23:23,929
[waitress] Another meat
and bones?

1400
01:23:23,964 --> 01:23:25,069
Sure.

1401
01:23:27,002 --> 01:23:31,213
Connor, the dirty cop,
was real dirty.

1402
01:23:31,247 --> 01:23:34,112
Dr. Blood,
now Dr. Blood was something

1403
01:23:34,147 --> 01:23:35,907
right out of a horror film.

1404
01:23:35,941 --> 01:23:38,841
He used Halloween-style fangs
to kill all of his victims.

1405
01:23:38,875 --> 01:23:41,292
He was a folklore copycat.

1406
01:23:41,326 --> 01:23:44,019
Went from idolizing one beast
to another.

1407
01:23:44,053 --> 01:23:46,814
Once he killed off his
quota and got bored,

1408
01:23:46,849 --> 01:23:48,506
he would pick up another
folklore beast

1409
01:23:48,540 --> 01:23:51,198
to continue to instill horror
into the communities.

1410
01:23:51,233 --> 01:23:52,751
How many did he kill?

1411
01:23:52,786 --> 01:23:54,822
[cop] DNA tests just keep
on coming.

1412
01:23:54,857 --> 01:23:56,203
Dozens.

1413
01:23:56,238 --> 01:23:57,756
All right, thanks, kid.

1414
01:23:59,689 --> 01:24:01,243
Oh, I almost forgot.

1415
01:24:02,278 --> 01:24:04,280
You have an invitation.

1416
01:24:12,012 --> 01:24:13,048
What is it?

1417
01:24:20,296 --> 01:24:22,022

Don't worry.
It will be fine.

1425
01:25:02,442 --> 01:25:03,753
After knowing the whole story,

1426
01:25:03,788 --> 01:25:05,617
do you really expect me
to believe that?

1427
01:25:07,240 --> 01:25:09,138
No, but do.

01:26:15,239 --> 01:26:17,137
No!
[Daciana squeals]

1445
01:26:17,172 --> 01:26:19,519
Blood, my favorite!

1446
01:26:19,553 --> 01:26:21,003
Sorry, but can someone tell me

1447
01:26:21,037 --> 01:26:23,316
how come you're not dead
like I last see you?

1448
01:26:23,868 --> 01:26:26,111
We were not dead, my child.

1449
01:26:26,146 --> 01:26:28,286
We only looked that way.

1450
01:26:28,321 --> 01:26:30,081
Well, we were almost dead.

1451
01:26:31,013 --> 01:26:32,946
[Brandusa]
Yeah, it was pretty nasty.

1452
01:26:33,602 --> 01:26:35,673
[Vampfather] Here, sit down.

1453
01:26:40,919 --> 01:26:43,301
A piece of cake, Vampfather?

1454
01:26:43,336 --> 01:26:46,960
Ah, just a--no, no, no, no,
I'm watching my weight.

1455
01:26:49,100 --> 01:26:52,034
These youngsters have not
yet learned the lesson

1456
01:26:52,068 --> 01:26:55,037
of patience or sacrifice.

1457
01:26:55,071 --> 01:26:57,867
I told them there was
a surprise coming.

1458
01:26:58,592 --> 01:27:00,560
Oh, can I tell her,
Vampfather?

1459
01:27:00,594 --> 01:27:03,183
See what I mean
about patience?

1460
01:27:03,218 --> 01:27:05,944
See, the deadly stakes
were only meant

1461
01:27:05,979 --> 01:27:09,431
to test our resolve
to stay true to our species.

1462
01:27:09,465 --> 01:27:11,778
Let me continue.
I hate listening.

1463
01:27:11,812 --> 01:27:14,090
Us vampires were truly dying,
not able

1464
01:27:14,125 --> 01:27:16,023
any longer to survive
on the pure blood

1465
01:27:16,058 --> 01:27:18,405
of the purified humans,
so we had to go--

1466
01:27:18,440 --> 01:27:21,857
So mighty Vampfather,
our patriarch,

1467
01:27:21,891 --> 01:27:25,205
had Dr. Switchfire
in Transylvania create

1468
01:27:25,240 --> 01:27:28,173
a special toxin applied
to the tip of the stake,

1469
01:27:28,208 --> 01:27:31,211
and once the tip
of the stake employs our heart,

1470
01:27:31,246 --> 01:27:33,834
our blood evolves
with the serum to accept

1471
01:27:33,869 --> 01:27:35,595
the human blood once again.

1472
01:27:36,389 --> 01:27:40,669
Okay, all sit, everyone.

1473
01:27:40,703 --> 01:27:43,741
[dark music]

1474
01:27:46,813 --> 01:27:51,542
This all, I'm sure,
has been a very traumatizing

1475
01:27:51,576 --> 01:27:53,475
journey for Sasha,

1476
01:27:56,063 --> 01:27:57,927
who, since a child,

1477
01:27:57,962 --> 01:28:02,311
her only dream was
to become a real human.

1478
01:28:06,108 --> 01:28:07,454
[music stops]

1479
01:28:08,869 --> 01:28:12,321
You are more human
than you know.

1480
01:28:14,116 --> 01:28:15,428
I can still fly.

1481
01:28:17,637 --> 01:28:20,640
[dark music]

1482
01:28:27,267 --> 01:28:29,683
New Century resolution:

1483
01:28:29,718 --> 01:28:33,446
we shall fulfill
our survival requirements

1484
01:28:33,480 --> 01:28:38,278
while doing the human society
a moral favor.

1485
01:28:38,313 --> 01:28:42,593
We shall feed only
on the blood of evil humans.

1486
01:28:42,627 --> 01:28:44,767
[growls]

1487
01:28:44,802 --> 01:28:47,494
Though far and in between,

1488
01:28:47,529 --> 01:28:50,290
there are sufficient numbers

1489
01:28:50,325 --> 01:28:52,188
to keep our bellies full.

1490
01:28:52,879 --> 01:28:55,537
[Grigore] Good, Vampfather,

1491
01:28:55,571 --> 01:28:58,333
because I am hungry.

1492
01:28:58,367 --> 01:29:01,543
[vampires snarl]

1493
01:29:01,577 --> 01:29:03,890
Sasha, what is the matter?

1494
01:29:03,924 --> 01:29:06,341
Yeah, your idea
is really good.

1495
01:29:07,134 --> 01:29:08,343
So?

1496
01:29:09,896 --> 01:29:12,347
Is there a way for me
to become a real human?

1497
01:29:14,349 --> 01:29:15,488
Come, my child.

1498
01:29:15,522 --> 01:29:18,422
[vampires chatter]

1499
01:29:21,045 --> 01:29:24,359
[Grigore laughs]

1500
01:29:31,607 --> 01:29:33,229
There is a way.

1501
01:29:40,409 --> 01:29:43,792
Now, it has never
been done before,

1502
01:29:48,590 --> 01:29:50,592
and it won't be easy.

1503
01:29:50,626 --> 01:29:51,938
Really?

1504
01:29:54,906 --> 01:29:58,565
You must bite yourself
on the neck.

1505
01:30:00,464 --> 01:30:02,155
That's impossible.

1506
01:30:05,192 --> 01:30:08,851
It's never been done before,

1507
01:30:08,886 --> 01:30:10,715
and it won't be easy.

1508
01:30:11,751 --> 01:30:13,580
[Sasha] But how, Vampfather?

1509
01:30:17,446 --> 01:30:21,554
There is a reason why we
do not cast a reflection.

1510
01:30:21,588 --> 01:30:24,591
[dramatic, sweet music]

1511
01:30:50,410 --> 01:30:53,448
[♪♪]

1512
01:31:11,914 --> 01:31:15,987
[narrator] In the end, 
the beauty of legends is,

1513
01:31:16,022 --> 01:31:19,163
if you believe 
with all your heart,

1514
01:31:19,197 --> 01:31:22,477
the legend creates miracles.

1515
01:31:27,205 --> 01:31:30,243
[dark, dramatic music]

1516
01:32:22,053 --> 01:32:23,641
[eerie, haunting music]

1517
01:32:23,676 --> 01:32:25,436
[bats chittering]

1518
01:32:28,335 --> 01:32:31,097
-[Grigore roars]
