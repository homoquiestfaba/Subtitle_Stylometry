1
00:00:20,987 --> 00:00:24,650
You know, the mouth
really is an amazing orifice.

2
00:00:24,758 --> 00:00:27,727
What a phenomenal creation
from mother nature.

3
00:00:27,827 --> 00:00:29,761
So poly-functional.

4
00:00:29,863 --> 00:00:32,229
We need it to breathe, obviously,

5
00:00:32,332 --> 00:00:35,233
but it can also taste and speak,

6
00:00:35,335 --> 00:00:37,599
sometimes in many tongues.

7
00:00:37,704 --> 00:00:40,901
Suck, lick, kiss.

8
00:00:41,007 --> 00:00:44,443
We use it as a weapon when we bite.

9
00:00:44,544 --> 00:00:46,876
And, of course, my personal favorite,

10
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:48,845
blow.

11
00:00:48,948 --> 00:00:50,916
A variety of instruments, of course.

12
00:00:51,017 --> 00:00:53,315
Okay. I'll get to the point.

13
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:54,910
Put it in your mouth.

14
00:00:55,021 --> 00:00:57,785
Let it roll around a little bit inside there.

15
00:00:57,891 --> 00:00:59,859
Get a feeling for it.

16
00:01:01,461 --> 00:01:05,124
Now... roll your tongue around the head of it.

17
00:01:05,231 --> 00:01:08,291
Doesn't it give you a sense of power?

18
00:01:08,401 --> 00:01:10,562
Now, suck hard.

19
00:01:10,670 --> 00:01:11,762
A little bit harder.

20
00:01:11,871 --> 00:01:13,862
Don't let the stuff go down your throat.

21
00:01:13,973 --> 00:01:15,702
It'll make you choke.

22
00:01:15,809 --> 00:01:17,572
Trust me.

23
00:01:19,979 --> 00:01:21,913
You obviously swallow, martine.

24
00:01:22,182 --> 00:01:23,649
What? No, i don't.

25
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:26,378
- Never in a million years.
- Busted.

26
00:01:28,588 --> 00:01:30,579
Hey. Check out this guy.

27
00:01:30,690 --> 00:01:32,783
Yeah, but i bet he's a ninety-niner.

28
00:01:32,892 --> 00:01:35,690
Hit me, martine. What's a ninety-niner?

29
00:01:35,795 --> 00:01:38,161
It's the difference between guys and girls,

30
00:01:38,264 --> 00:01:39,891
- really?
- Otherwise known as a ninety-niner.

31
00:01:39,999 --> 00:01:43,366
Okay. A guy could be in a
restaurant with his girlfriend

32
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:46,701
- or fiance who he's completely in love with,
- of course.

33
00:01:46,806 --> 00:01:49,866
And then he feels a rumble
in his bladder and decides,

34
00:01:49,976 --> 00:01:52,774
"oh, i have to go to the bathroom." so...

35
00:01:52,879 --> 00:01:55,905
he tells his girlfriend
very politely, "i have to go."

36
00:01:56,015 --> 00:01:57,539
Excuses himself.

37
00:01:57,650 --> 00:01:59,641
And, just as he's about to go in,

38
00:01:59,752 --> 00:02:01,913
a beautiful woman comes up to him and says,

39
00:02:02,188 --> 00:02:04,918
"i've been watching you eat all night,

40
00:02:05,191 --> 00:02:07,853
"and i was just so hot and bothered,

41
00:02:07,961 --> 00:02:12,125
"i was wondering... if i could... give you head.

42
00:02:12,232 --> 00:02:15,224
In the bathroom. No strings
attached. What do you say?"

43
00:02:15,335 --> 00:02:16,529
- Uh-huh.
- Mmm.

44
00:02:16,636 --> 00:02:19,537
99 percent of guys would say, "yes,"

45
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:21,869
and go in and get the job.

46
00:02:22,976 --> 00:02:25,877
Now, if the situation
was reversed, and a woman

47
00:02:25,979 --> 00:02:28,539
was approached by a gorgeous
guy outside the restroom,

48
00:02:28,648 --> 00:02:32,243
given a similar line,
99 percent of women would say...

49
00:02:32,352 --> 00:02:34,912
i don't know. I think i'm that one percent, then.

50
00:02:35,188 --> 00:02:36,849
Maybe it's my maternal instinct.

51
00:02:36,956 --> 00:02:40,357
'Cause i would never like
to see a good man go hungry.

52
00:02:41,394 --> 00:02:43,362
That's my girl.

53
00:03:25,638 --> 00:03:27,868
That's my mom's grave.

54
00:03:27,974 --> 00:03:31,569
She died when i was 12 years old.

55
00:03:31,678 --> 00:03:34,613
Well, when i say "died,"
she committed suicide.

56
00:03:34,714 --> 00:03:39,276
It's weird. I can almost feel her presence.

57
00:03:39,385 --> 00:03:41,785
I can almost smell her perfume.

58
00:03:44,457 --> 00:03:47,893
My father came home early
from work one day, and...

59
00:03:47,994 --> 00:03:51,259
he found her in bed with another man.

60
00:03:51,364 --> 00:03:53,730
No one ever spoke about it.

61
00:03:59,005 --> 00:04:01,838
Maybe that's why she did it.

62
00:04:01,941 --> 00:04:05,206
She couldn't take the guilt.

63
00:04:05,311 --> 00:04:08,439
She hung herself.

64
00:04:08,548 --> 00:04:10,914
And this was my mom's car.

65
00:04:11,184 --> 00:04:13,482
She called it her bond car.

66
00:04:13,586 --> 00:04:16,851
She has a small role in
one of the early bond films.

67
00:04:16,956 --> 00:04:18,890
It was only a walk-on, but,

68
00:04:19,158 --> 00:04:23,117
after that, she always said
that she was a bond girl.

69
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:26,664
So, this is where i work.

70
00:04:26,766 --> 00:04:28,700
Primal.

71
00:04:28,801 --> 00:04:31,861
There's no smoking here.

72
00:04:31,971 --> 00:04:33,871
Every movement i make

73
00:04:33,973 --> 00:04:37,409
is transmitted in a live sex 24 webcam.

74
00:04:37,510 --> 00:04:41,241
This is our resident cameraman.

75
00:04:41,347 --> 00:04:43,781
A.z., how you doin'?

76
00:04:43,883 --> 00:04:47,580
And we've got a pool with
a view outside our house.

77
00:04:47,687 --> 00:04:48,881
Beautiful. Isn't it?

78
00:04:48,988 --> 00:04:51,388
Web cameras everywhere.

79
00:04:51,491 --> 00:04:53,288
And...

80
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:57,657
this is my audience. Good morning.

81
00:04:57,764 --> 00:05:00,198
They pay very close attention.

82
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:02,734
And this is my room here.

83
00:05:06,939 --> 00:05:08,873
You like that?

84
00:05:09,942 --> 00:05:11,910
So, no peeking.

85
00:05:13,413 --> 00:05:15,904
And this is my little personal camera.

86
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:19,918
You can see me everywhere.

87
00:05:21,154 --> 00:05:23,588
And this is my uniform for today.

88
00:05:23,690 --> 00:05:25,920
What do you think? Pretty minimalist. Isn't it?

89
00:05:26,192 --> 00:05:29,650
I gotta confess and tell you
straight off the bat,

90
00:05:29,762 --> 00:05:31,855
i'm a bit of a bond fanatic.

91
00:05:31,964 --> 00:05:34,865
I always have been since i was a kid.

92
00:05:34,967 --> 00:05:37,162
Probably 'cause of my mom.

93
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:39,602
You know, if i wasn't doing this,

94
00:05:39,706 --> 00:05:42,470
i'd like to be a secret service agent.

95
00:05:46,379 --> 00:05:50,213
This is my... last detail.

96
00:05:51,718 --> 00:05:53,913
What do you think?

97
00:05:54,187 --> 00:05:56,747
You like me as a blonde?

98
00:05:58,324 --> 00:06:00,224
All right. Let's go.

99
00:06:00,326 --> 00:06:01,816
Let's meet everybody else.

100
00:06:01,928 --> 00:06:04,761
Don't think i'm gon' tell y'all my real name.

101
00:06:04,864 --> 00:06:08,766
Have all y'all freaks salivatin'
on my front porch humpin' my door handle?

102
00:06:08,868 --> 00:06:09,835
Hell, no!

103
00:06:18,945 --> 00:06:20,845
Okay, guys?

104
00:06:20,947 --> 00:06:23,108
Ready? Come on.

105
00:06:23,216 --> 00:06:25,650
Gonna meet my favorite, moon.

106
00:06:25,752 --> 00:06:27,686
This is one of our biggest hits.

107
00:06:27,787 --> 00:06:31,621
All over southeast asia, russia... big, big hit.

108
00:06:31,724 --> 00:06:33,783
Moon. This is cheyenne.

109
00:06:33,893 --> 00:06:36,123
Big in zimbabwe, japan,

110
00:06:36,229 --> 00:06:39,130
and, believe it or not, alabama.

111
00:06:40,967 --> 00:06:43,868
All right, guys. Come on this way.

112
00:06:48,708 --> 00:06:52,166
All right. Just... relax,
be yourselves, be cool.

113
00:06:52,278 --> 00:06:53,677
And remember one thing.

114
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:56,874
She doesn't like it if
you suck on her lips. Okay?

115
00:06:56,983 --> 00:06:58,746
Sweet kisses but nothing else. All right.

116
00:07:05,391 --> 00:07:07,086
You look great.

117
00:07:07,193 --> 00:07:10,594
All right. Guys this is a.z.
He's our webcam guy.

118
00:07:10,696 --> 00:07:13,824
He's always there, always
doing his little number.

119
00:07:13,933 --> 00:07:17,232
Bond, bond, and more bond.

120
00:07:17,336 --> 00:07:20,100
All right, guys. I own primal video.

121
00:07:20,206 --> 00:07:22,606
Everybody just calls me mr. A.

122
00:07:22,708 --> 00:07:25,700
We like to think of
ourselves as one big family.

123
00:07:25,812 --> 00:07:28,440
One big, incestuous,

124
00:07:28,548 --> 00:07:31,108
dysfunctional family, just like home.

125
00:07:31,217 --> 00:07:33,151
This is our pride and joy.

126
00:07:33,252 --> 00:07:35,846
Number-one star in the world, this is moon.

127
00:07:35,955 --> 00:07:37,855
Guys, introduce yourselves.

128
00:07:37,957 --> 00:07:39,857
Hi, moon. I'm marko.

129
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:42,519
God, i just love your body of work.

130
00:07:42,628 --> 00:07:45,461
I-i've seen almost all your films, and, uh...

131
00:07:45,565 --> 00:07:47,328
i don't know. Y-you're just awesome.

132
00:07:47,433 --> 00:07:49,458
Have you done any acting work before?

133
00:07:49,569 --> 00:07:52,561
Well, i did romeo and juliet
when i was in school.

134
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,764
I'm basil.

135
00:07:55,875 --> 00:07:58,207
Aw, don't let the wrinkles, uh, scare ya.

136
00:07:58,311 --> 00:08:00,802
Come on. Wrinkles are a girl's best friend.

137
00:08:00,913 --> 00:08:03,677
I always say, the more wrinkles
down here, the greater...

138
00:08:03,783 --> 00:08:05,808
can i stop you right there, basil?

139
00:08:05,918 --> 00:08:09,319
A little imagination
goes a long way. Thank you.

140
00:08:09,422 --> 00:08:12,619
Me, i'm from a small town you
probably never even heard of.

141
00:08:12,725 --> 00:08:13,851
Macon, georgia.

142
00:08:14,126 --> 00:08:16,321
But, you know, you're a bona fide movie star,

143
00:08:16,429 --> 00:08:18,897
and i really... i-i just
wanna be your leading man.

144
00:08:19,165 --> 00:08:21,156
- Ha-ha-ha.
- That's, uh, sammy.

145
00:08:21,267 --> 00:08:23,360
He's always eating. He's from texas.

146
00:08:23,469 --> 00:08:26,131
He really doesn't say much besides, "yup,"

147
00:08:26,239 --> 00:08:29,538
- and, "dang it."
- Nice to meet you.

148
00:08:29,642 --> 00:08:31,269
- Ready?
- Yeah.

149
00:08:31,377 --> 00:08:33,174
Okay, guys, let's drop 'em.

150
00:08:35,214 --> 00:08:38,377
You know, that's what i hated
about the movie full monty.

151
00:08:38,484 --> 00:08:40,850
There was no full monty.

152
00:08:40,953 --> 00:08:44,411
What's up with that?
Quarter monty? Half monty?

153
00:08:44,524 --> 00:08:46,424
No monty?

154
00:08:46,526 --> 00:08:48,494
Anyway... any thoughts?

155
00:08:50,162 --> 00:08:52,460
Actually, i have a few.

156
00:08:52,565 --> 00:08:55,398
People always talk about the size of the penis,

157
00:08:55,501 --> 00:08:57,298
but they never talk about the shape.

158
00:08:57,403 --> 00:09:00,338
And shape is critical. Ask any girl.

159
00:09:00,439 --> 00:09:01,872
There's the width,

160
00:09:02,141 --> 00:09:04,769
but then there's also the shape of the head.

161
00:09:04,877 --> 00:09:05,866
And the tantric say,

162
00:09:06,145 --> 00:09:08,807
that the thumb is shaped like the penis.

163
00:09:08,915 --> 00:09:11,748
So, if the thumb is shaped like a mushroom,

164
00:09:11,851 --> 00:09:13,148
you got a mushroom head.

165
00:09:13,252 --> 00:09:16,847
If it's shaped like a pencil,
you got a pencil head.

166
00:09:17,123 --> 00:09:19,318
And, uh, my girls and i have found

167
00:09:19,425 --> 00:09:21,825
that the mushroom heads
give the most pleasure.

168
00:09:21,928 --> 00:09:24,192
And besides, my mom always told me

169
00:09:24,297 --> 00:09:27,164
not to stick pencils in my mouth.

170
00:09:28,935 --> 00:09:31,768
I think you all look very interesting.

171
00:09:31,871 --> 00:09:33,532
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

172
00:09:33,639 --> 00:09:36,870
All right, gentlemen.
Would you kindly wait outside, please?

173
00:09:37,143 --> 00:09:40,874
Why don't you relax?
Have yourselves a drink, some coffee.

174
00:09:41,147 --> 00:09:43,342
Do a little stretching. Okay?
A little flexibility.

175
00:09:43,449 --> 00:09:46,509
Gotta get in different positions.
You know what i mean?

176
00:09:47,954 --> 00:09:51,822
I think you can... have some fun.

177
00:09:51,924 --> 00:09:55,382
Yeah. I think i'm gonna...
i'm gonna go with marko.

178
00:09:55,494 --> 00:09:57,257
He seems... he seems innocent.

179
00:09:57,363 --> 00:09:59,661
Okay. You like those innocent types.

180
00:09:59,765 --> 00:10:01,562
Yes.

181
00:10:01,667 --> 00:10:03,396
- Feeling okay?
- Yeah.

182
00:10:03,502 --> 00:10:04,491
- Yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

183
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:06,868
- Did you get your car repaired?
- Yes.

184
00:10:06,973 --> 00:10:08,907
That's the twentieth time you've repaired it.

185
00:10:09,175 --> 00:10:10,472
I love my car.

186
00:10:10,576 --> 00:10:11,736
It looks great.

187
00:10:11,844 --> 00:10:15,871
But a safer car... might
protect you a little bit better.

188
00:10:15,982 --> 00:10:18,473
- Mm-hmm.
- All right. I'll shut up.

189
00:10:18,584 --> 00:10:20,882
I know this may not be the right time,

190
00:10:20,987 --> 00:10:22,750
but i did bring the new contract,

191
00:10:22,855 --> 00:10:24,584
- 'cause your contract runs out.
- Mm-hmm.

192
00:10:24,690 --> 00:10:26,885
Maybe you can put a john hancock on it?

193
00:10:26,993 --> 00:10:28,221
Right now?

194
00:10:28,327 --> 00:10:31,728
No, no. Look. I'll leave it here. Take a few
days.

195
00:10:31,831 --> 00:10:34,493
- Can i get you anything else?
- No. I'm good.

196
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:37,160
Can i just have my five minutes now?

197
00:10:37,269 --> 00:10:39,237
- Thank you.
- Have fun.

198
00:10:40,906 --> 00:10:44,467
I don't know if it's quiet time or psyche time,

199
00:10:44,577 --> 00:10:48,707
but for me, i always need
five minutes to get myself into it.

200
00:10:48,814 --> 00:10:52,477
Get myself in the zone before i do a scene.

201
00:10:52,585 --> 00:10:54,815
No matter how many times i do it,

202
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:57,718
it always feels like the first time.

203
00:10:57,823 --> 00:11:00,257
You know what i mean?

204
00:11:00,359 --> 00:11:02,850
Just before...

205
00:11:02,962 --> 00:11:04,589
you know? It's like...

206
00:11:04,697 --> 00:11:07,461
that moment right before you dive into a pool.

207
00:11:07,566 --> 00:11:10,865
It's that... fear mixed with adrenaline.

208
00:11:10,970 --> 00:11:14,303
You always think
the water is gonna be so cold,

209
00:11:14,407 --> 00:11:18,707
but once you're in, you forget
what it was like to be out.

210
00:11:24,417 --> 00:11:26,146
Hi, moon.

211
00:11:26,252 --> 00:11:28,345
- Can i come in?
- Hey. Yeah.

212
00:11:29,689 --> 00:11:33,853
That executive director guy,
he wanted me to give you this.

213
00:11:33,959 --> 00:11:35,950
- My certificate of health.
- Oh, yeah.

214
00:11:36,228 --> 00:11:38,628
I just had the test last week, right there.

215
00:11:38,731 --> 00:11:40,494
- See? There's the date.
- Nice. Perfect.

216
00:11:40,599 --> 00:11:41,657
Thank you.

217
00:11:41,767 --> 00:11:43,291
For what?

218
00:11:43,402 --> 00:11:45,597
For the certificate.

219
00:11:45,705 --> 00:11:47,696
Oh, right. Right.

220
00:11:47,807 --> 00:11:50,901
I'm sorry. Uh, i guess
i'm just a little bit nervous here.

221
00:11:51,010 --> 00:11:53,570
This is actually my first time,
um, doing it on camera.

222
00:11:53,679 --> 00:11:54,941
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

223
00:11:55,214 --> 00:11:57,341
You know what? Just relax.

224
00:11:57,450 --> 00:12:01,853
Realize that it's like the first
time you've been with any girl.

225
00:12:01,954 --> 00:12:06,857
Just shut everything else off,
and then it's just you and me.

226
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:09,325
Wow. But what about
the thousands of people

227
00:12:09,428 --> 00:12:11,862
that are gonna be staring at us?

228
00:12:11,964 --> 00:12:13,363
Yeah, and them.

229
00:12:13,466 --> 00:12:15,661
Can they see us in here right now?

230
00:12:15,768 --> 00:12:17,201
Oh, yeah. They're everywhere.

231
00:12:17,303 --> 00:12:19,271
They're even in the bathrooms.

232
00:12:19,371 --> 00:12:21,862
It's very, you know, truman show.

233
00:12:21,974 --> 00:12:25,432
So, what does that mean if i can't get hard?

234
00:12:25,544 --> 00:12:27,876
Then thousands of people will know about it.

235
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:29,242
It's no big deal.

236
00:12:29,348 --> 00:12:31,475
Okay. I'm not gonna think about that.

237
00:12:31,584 --> 00:12:33,643
Oh, my god.

238
00:12:33,753 --> 00:12:37,245
I'm gonna take care of you,
and you're gonna do fine. Okay?

239
00:12:37,356 --> 00:12:38,880
- Okay. All right.
- You'll do great.

240
00:12:38,991 --> 00:12:40,356
I feel better now. Yeah.

241
00:12:47,366 --> 00:12:49,391
I'm sorry.

242
00:12:51,337 --> 00:12:53,305
I know what you're thinking.

243
00:12:53,405 --> 00:12:56,533
What's a girl like me doing a job like this for?

244
00:12:56,642 --> 00:12:59,338
"Doesn't she know she doesn't
need to be doing this?

245
00:12:59,445 --> 00:13:01,572
"What's wrong with her? Is she on drugs?

246
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:04,774
Doesn't she know she doesn't
need to be doing this?"

247
00:13:04,884 --> 00:13:09,253
Sorry, but that really does feel good.

248
00:13:09,355 --> 00:13:11,846
I don't think of myself as a slut,

249
00:13:11,957 --> 00:13:14,482
although i know a lot
of you are judging me now.

250
00:13:14,593 --> 00:13:18,529
Someone said to me a long time ago,

251
00:13:18,631 --> 00:13:21,327
"find something in life that you love to do,

252
00:13:21,433 --> 00:13:23,628
"and make that your line of work.

253
00:13:23,736 --> 00:13:25,863
'Cause then it doesn't
feel like work to you."

254
00:13:28,941 --> 00:13:32,240
Well, when i'm having sex,
i honestly don't find myself

255
00:13:32,344 --> 00:13:34,869
staring at the clock thinking,
"when is 5:00 coming?"

256
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:39,508
Although... i might be coming at 5:00.

257
00:13:39,618 --> 00:13:43,645
You know, i used to be
really shy when i was a kid.

258
00:13:43,756 --> 00:13:46,247
Hardly talked to people when i was young.

259
00:13:46,358 --> 00:13:48,849
I just wanted to be in nature, alone.

260
00:13:48,961 --> 00:13:53,796
And by the way, no, i'm not a drug addict.

261
00:13:53,899 --> 00:13:57,892
And no, i've never been abused when i was...

262
00:13:58,003 --> 00:14:02,337
nine or 13 by my father, uncle, or minister.

263
00:14:02,441 --> 00:14:04,909
Back in high school, if you were a girl,

264
00:14:05,177 --> 00:14:08,112
you slept with a lot of guys,
you were labeled a slut.

265
00:14:08,214 --> 00:14:12,150
If you were a guy and you bedded
a lot of girls, you were a stud.

266
00:14:12,251 --> 00:14:15,482
In my world, i was a female stud.

267
00:14:18,791 --> 00:14:20,918
Oh!

268
00:14:27,967 --> 00:14:29,935
How was that for you?

269
00:14:42,548 --> 00:14:43,742
Hi, kiska.

270
00:14:43,849 --> 00:14:45,817
I thought you'd never come home.

271
00:14:45,918 --> 00:14:47,886
Oh, i know.

272
00:14:47,987 --> 00:14:50,820
I want to fix you a scrumptious dinner.

273
00:14:50,923 --> 00:14:52,413
How was work, kiska?

274
00:14:52,524 --> 00:14:53,923
It was good, dad.

275
00:14:54,193 --> 00:14:58,823
I've told him many times
what i do, but he insists on a vet.

276
00:14:58,931 --> 00:15:00,159
Were the animals misbehaving?

277
00:15:00,266 --> 00:15:03,702
The animals were behaving fine.

278
00:15:03,802 --> 00:15:05,827
My dad calls me kiska.

279
00:15:05,938 --> 00:15:09,806
It's what he called my mom.
They were very in love.

280
00:15:10,943 --> 00:15:14,811
He kinda... had a breakdown after she died.

281
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:16,814
He's got parkinson's.

282
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:19,851
You know the crazy thing about parkinson's,

283
00:15:19,952 --> 00:15:23,479
is that it's tailor-made for each person?

284
00:15:23,589 --> 00:15:26,183
His is pretty severe, though.

285
00:15:26,292 --> 00:15:28,852
Sometimes, his memory's real clear.

286
00:15:28,961 --> 00:15:32,328
And other times, his memory's just gone.

287
00:15:32,431 --> 00:15:35,400
He gets disoriented and thinks i'm mom.

288
00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:39,670
Maybe he just sees her in me.

289
00:15:39,772 --> 00:15:41,865
Hey.

290
00:15:41,974 --> 00:15:44,875
Hey. I'm goin' out tonight, pops.

291
00:15:44,977 --> 00:15:46,467
I have a date.

292
00:15:46,578 --> 00:15:48,478
Oh.

293
00:15:48,580 --> 00:15:52,209
I remember the first date
i went on with your mother.

294
00:15:52,318 --> 00:15:54,809
She was painfully beautiful.

295
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:57,855
I know. Here.

296
00:15:57,957 --> 00:16:00,357
I don't forget nothin'.

297
00:16:00,459 --> 00:16:02,893
I don't forget nothin', 'cause...

298
00:16:06,165 --> 00:16:08,827
when i was 21, i went to egypt and israel.

299
00:16:08,934 --> 00:16:10,333
- Uh-huh.
- Mm-hmm.

300
00:16:10,436 --> 00:16:13,166
I wanted to see where
jesus walked on the water.

301
00:16:13,272 --> 00:16:16,207
And, after 12 hours, i got off the bus and...

302
00:16:16,308 --> 00:16:20,677
there was an old fisherman
standing there, and i said,

303
00:16:20,779 --> 00:16:23,441
"is this where jesus walked on the water?"

304
00:16:23,549 --> 00:16:25,676
He said, "yeah. Jesus was a fisherman."

305
00:16:25,784 --> 00:16:26,751
Uh-huh.

306
00:16:26,852 --> 00:16:28,479
"You smoke hashish?"

307
00:16:28,587 --> 00:16:31,147
And i... smoked.

308
00:16:31,256 --> 00:16:32,780
You did? You smoked hashish?

309
00:16:32,891 --> 00:16:36,520
Yeah. My bladder was full, so
i went to make behind a bush,

310
00:16:36,628 --> 00:16:40,587
and when i got out, i saw the old... fisherman...

311
00:16:41,567 --> 00:16:43,762
standing on the water.

312
00:16:43,869 --> 00:16:46,633
Standing on the goddamn water.

313
00:16:46,739 --> 00:16:48,570
And, i thought, "wow.

314
00:16:48,674 --> 00:16:51,507
This is good hash."

315
00:16:53,178 --> 00:16:55,510
So... i...

316
00:16:55,614 --> 00:16:57,878
he was standing on the edge of the lake.

317
00:16:57,983 --> 00:17:00,247
He walked over to me and he said,

318
00:17:00,352 --> 00:17:03,617
"come walk with me," and i said,
"i don't walk on the water."

319
00:17:03,722 --> 00:17:06,088
And he said, "look. Put your foot right here."

320
00:17:06,191 --> 00:17:10,651
And i dipped my toe in the water
and it felt solid and i...

321
00:17:10,763 --> 00:17:13,288
i thought, "what?" and he
said, "it's rock right under

322
00:17:13,399 --> 00:17:16,630
the surface of the water, but
it's so dark you can't see it."

323
00:17:16,735 --> 00:17:20,364
And these rocks extend...
60 feet out into the lake.

324
00:17:20,472 --> 00:17:23,305
All the fisherman go out there to catch the fish,

325
00:17:23,409 --> 00:17:25,707
because that's where the best fish are.

326
00:17:25,811 --> 00:17:28,837
They've been doing it for centuries.

327
00:17:28,947 --> 00:17:31,882
So, we walked out to the middle of the lake,

328
00:17:32,151 --> 00:17:35,279
and he said, "you see? Around here...

329
00:17:36,321 --> 00:17:38,289
everybody walks on water."

330
00:17:39,858 --> 00:17:41,883
I walked on the water.

331
00:17:43,462 --> 00:17:45,430
Now, look at me.

332
00:17:46,532 --> 00:17:49,126
Can't tie my own shoes.

333
00:17:49,234 --> 00:17:51,862
I love you. You know that.

334
00:17:51,970 --> 00:17:53,335
I love you, kiska.

335
00:17:54,907 --> 00:17:57,671
Sometimes i'm not sure
what to wear on a date.

336
00:17:57,776 --> 00:17:59,573
Especially a first date.

337
00:17:59,678 --> 00:18:03,409
Ha. Even more so, a blind date.

338
00:18:03,515 --> 00:18:06,746
This one, jessie set me up on.

339
00:18:06,852 --> 00:18:09,821
I'm not sure she told him what i do.

340
00:18:09,922 --> 00:18:12,686
You know, that i'm-i'm a porn star.

341
00:18:14,226 --> 00:18:19,095
I know it shouldn't matter,
but it kind of does. You know?

342
00:18:19,198 --> 00:18:21,632
You know, you look familiar.

343
00:18:21,733 --> 00:18:23,792
- Yeah.
- Have i seen you before?

344
00:18:23,902 --> 00:18:26,462
Like i give you a ride before, maybe?

345
00:18:26,572 --> 00:18:29,439
No. I don't think so.

346
00:18:29,541 --> 00:18:32,840
You in, uh, movies? Tv?

347
00:18:32,945 --> 00:18:34,708
Not technically.

348
00:18:34,813 --> 00:18:36,337
Sorry.

349
00:18:39,685 --> 00:18:41,346
Oh, shit!

350
00:18:41,453 --> 00:18:43,819
Y-y-you're... you're the porn star.

351
00:18:43,922 --> 00:18:46,482
Um, moonrise. Right?

352
00:18:46,592 --> 00:18:47,854
Yeah.

353
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:50,224
I knew i seen you before.

354
00:18:50,329 --> 00:18:53,127
You are much more sexy in real life.

355
00:18:53,232 --> 00:18:56,861
I'm not paying you false compliments.

356
00:18:56,969 --> 00:18:59,233
My wife and i have watched you.

357
00:18:59,338 --> 00:19:03,672
And... i remember her telling
me that, out of all the girls,

358
00:19:03,775 --> 00:19:07,074
you are the most beautiful, classy one.

359
00:19:07,179 --> 00:19:09,670
Thanks. Tell her thanks, too.

360
00:19:09,781 --> 00:19:12,113
Oh, i will. She'll be so excited.

361
00:19:13,552 --> 00:19:15,816
No, no. Not like that.

362
00:19:15,921 --> 00:19:18,583
Well, maybe like that.

363
00:19:18,690 --> 00:19:21,124
I should be so lucky.

364
00:19:31,436 --> 00:19:35,566
This was, uh, my mom's choker.
It's for good luck.

365
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:40,839
Apparently, he's, uh, cooking
dinner for me at his house.

366
00:19:40,946 --> 00:19:44,211
You know, i think it's sexy when a man cooks.

367
00:19:44,316 --> 00:19:47,752
Just like i think it's sexy
when a woman chops wood.

368
00:19:47,853 --> 00:19:51,448
As long as it's not your wood. Right?

369
00:19:51,557 --> 00:19:53,684
All right. Here we go.

370
00:20:01,833 --> 00:20:02,822
- Hi.
- Hi.

371
00:20:02,935 --> 00:20:04,163
I'm kip.

372
00:20:04,269 --> 00:20:06,794
Hi. I'm, uh... i'm moon.

373
00:20:06,905 --> 00:20:08,304
It's nice to meet you.

374
00:20:08,407 --> 00:20:09,897
Nice to meet you.

375
00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:16,743
Thank you.

376
00:20:16,848 --> 00:20:18,475
Sure.

377
00:20:21,787 --> 00:20:23,880
Here you go.

378
00:20:23,989 --> 00:20:26,651
Wow. Food looks great.

379
00:20:26,758 --> 00:20:28,953
Thank you for taking the time to cook.

380
00:20:29,228 --> 00:20:31,788
It's so much better than
going out to a restaurant.

381
00:20:31,897 --> 00:20:35,492
When someone cooks, they put
a part of themselves in it.

382
00:20:35,601 --> 00:20:38,229
Their energy. Their flavor.

383
00:20:38,337 --> 00:20:40,828
Well, i hope you like my flavor.

384
00:20:41,974 --> 00:20:43,532
I'm sure i will.

385
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:51,806
I like to lay all my cards on the table right
away.

386
00:20:51,917 --> 00:20:53,248
I'm 27 years old.

387
00:20:53,352 --> 00:20:57,880
I'm currently studying to become a surgeon.

388
00:20:57,990 --> 00:21:01,687
I'm gonna work mostly with
the prostate and the elderly.

389
00:21:01,793 --> 00:21:04,284
- Wow.
- Yeah. I love... i love old...

390
00:21:04,396 --> 00:21:06,864
- i love old people. And i just, uh...
- wow.

391
00:21:06,965 --> 00:21:09,126
Yeah, i really feel a bond with that.

392
00:21:09,234 --> 00:21:11,862
No. I'm... i'm totally kidding you. I...

393
00:21:11,970 --> 00:21:15,406
i'm just... i'm like everybody
else in this city. I'm an actor.

394
00:21:15,507 --> 00:21:16,804
It's kinda boring.

395
00:21:16,908 --> 00:21:20,867
So, uh... y-you do...
you do like film, television?

396
00:21:20,979 --> 00:21:23,812
Yeah. I've done some movies.
I'm on a television show.

397
00:21:23,915 --> 00:21:25,883
I'm sorry. I don't really watch television.

398
00:21:25,984 --> 00:21:27,918
No. God. It's a good thing.

399
00:21:28,186 --> 00:21:31,314
It's definitely a plus.

400
00:21:31,423 --> 00:21:34,654
I mean, i don't get mobbed
when i walk down the street,

401
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:37,888
but you never know why people
are trying to get close to you.

402
00:21:37,996 --> 00:21:40,294
You never know if the girl talking to you

403
00:21:40,399 --> 00:21:41,889
- actually likes you.
- Right.

404
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,197
It's good to know that you're
not judging me based on that.

405
00:21:45,304 --> 00:21:46,566
You're judging me for me.

406
00:21:46,672 --> 00:21:48,572
No. I'm not judging you at all.

407
00:21:48,674 --> 00:21:50,471
Why not?

408
00:21:50,575 --> 00:21:51,906
I'm not a judge.

409
00:21:52,010 --> 00:21:54,535
- Okay.
- And, uh...

410
00:21:54,646 --> 00:21:56,739
yeah. I kinda go with my own instincts.

411
00:21:56,848 --> 00:21:57,974
Do you have a girlfriend?

412
00:21:58,250 --> 00:22:01,378
If i had a girlfriend,
i wouldn't have asked you here.

413
00:22:03,288 --> 00:22:06,746
I know you just walked in,
but what jessie said about you...

414
00:22:06,858 --> 00:22:07,916
is right.

415
00:22:08,193 --> 00:22:11,924
She says you are warm... and glowing.

416
00:22:13,732 --> 00:22:15,859
Uh, what else did she say?

417
00:22:15,967 --> 00:22:18,299
Not much. Why?

418
00:22:18,403 --> 00:22:20,871
Why, indeed.

419
00:22:20,972 --> 00:22:22,872
We need to have some more wine.

420
00:22:22,974 --> 00:22:24,407
Can you imagine if that happened

421
00:22:24,509 --> 00:22:27,740
in the first night you had sex with someone?

422
00:22:27,846 --> 00:22:29,404
You probably wouldn't get lucky again.

423
00:22:29,514 --> 00:22:31,141
- No.
- That would be a deal-breaker?

424
00:22:31,249 --> 00:22:32,944
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

425
00:22:39,691 --> 00:22:41,386
Hey...

426
00:22:42,427 --> 00:22:44,793
kip, i just want to tell you,

427
00:22:44,896 --> 00:22:47,296
this food is really good.

428
00:22:47,399 --> 00:22:49,867
I really appreciate you making it.

429
00:22:49,968 --> 00:22:52,937
You know, i was feeling
a little down, and now it's...

430
00:22:53,205 --> 00:22:56,231
it's all gone. I haven't
laughed like this in so long.

431
00:22:56,341 --> 00:22:59,572
People... don't normally make me laugh.

432
00:23:02,948 --> 00:23:04,916
Come here.

433
00:23:15,193 --> 00:23:18,424
I thought you were gonna
drop me for a second.

434
00:23:18,530 --> 00:23:19,656
I wouldn't drop you.

435
00:23:21,466 --> 00:23:22,694
Oh.

436
00:23:22,801 --> 00:23:26,862
So, you've had to listen
to me go on and on about...

437
00:23:26,972 --> 00:23:29,463
acting and movies and...

438
00:23:29,574 --> 00:23:31,269
it's boring.

439
00:23:31,376 --> 00:23:33,936
Tell me about you. What do you do?

440
00:23:35,914 --> 00:23:38,576
Uh, i've done some work in prostate.

441
00:23:40,419 --> 00:23:42,887
It doesn't surprise me at this point, actually.

442
00:23:42,988 --> 00:23:44,888
No. But really, what do you do?

443
00:23:44,990 --> 00:23:46,958
Um...

444
00:23:48,727 --> 00:23:50,718
i'm a... i'm a porn star.

445
00:23:50,829 --> 00:23:52,956
You're very good.

446
00:23:54,933 --> 00:23:56,798
Seriously, what do you do?

447
00:23:58,503 --> 00:24:00,494
Seriously.

448
00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:03,830
Come on. Seriously.

449
00:24:03,942 --> 00:24:06,308
Seriously.

450
00:24:09,915 --> 00:24:11,610
Seriously.

451
00:24:11,716 --> 00:24:13,445
I'm sorry. That's...

452
00:24:13,552 --> 00:24:15,543
you know, jessie left that little...

453
00:24:15,654 --> 00:24:17,383
- yeah.
- That little detail out.

454
00:24:17,489 --> 00:24:19,719
Yeah. I figured she did.

455
00:24:19,825 --> 00:24:23,192
Wow. My mom, i know
she's gonna ask how this...

456
00:24:23,295 --> 00:24:25,320
- date went.
- What are you gonna tell her?

457
00:24:25,430 --> 00:24:27,489
I don't know. It was going really well.

458
00:24:27,599 --> 00:24:29,931
And then...

459
00:24:30,202 --> 00:24:32,136
i mean, i-i'm pretty open-minded. I am.

460
00:24:32,237 --> 00:24:34,467
I-i really am. But i...

461
00:24:34,573 --> 00:24:36,905
you don't look like a porn star at all.

462
00:24:37,175 --> 00:24:39,143
What does a porn star look like?

463
00:24:39,244 --> 00:24:40,871
I don't really know, i guess.

464
00:24:40,979 --> 00:24:43,311
I mean, meaner, nastier, not...

465
00:24:43,415 --> 00:24:45,474
just not you. That's...

466
00:24:45,584 --> 00:24:48,144
so, do you tell people? Do you just...

467
00:24:48,253 --> 00:24:49,880
you know, it-it depends.

468
00:24:49,988 --> 00:24:52,923
You just have to expect that
everyone's gonna make judgments.

469
00:24:53,191 --> 00:24:54,749
You know?

470
00:24:54,860 --> 00:24:56,725
Are you judging me right now?

471
00:24:56,828 --> 00:24:58,887
I don't know.

472
00:24:58,997 --> 00:25:02,660
I don't mean to, if i am. I j...

473
00:25:02,767 --> 00:25:04,826
i... i'm fascinated. Really.

474
00:25:04,936 --> 00:25:08,702
I'm fascinated, i'm confused,
i'm a little apprehensive.

475
00:25:08,807 --> 00:25:09,865
I'm...

476
00:25:10,141 --> 00:25:12,609
i'm a little bit turned on.

477
00:25:16,515 --> 00:25:18,540
I don't know. I mean...

478
00:25:18,650 --> 00:25:21,585
i just look at it that i'm not hurting anybody.

479
00:25:21,686 --> 00:25:26,487
And, hopefully, i'm giving
myself and some people pleasure.

480
00:25:26,591 --> 00:25:29,560
Yeah. Well, i-i'm sure you are.

481
00:25:31,963 --> 00:25:33,863
Wow. I'm... i'm sorry.

482
00:25:33,965 --> 00:25:37,196
I'm sorry. It's just a little bit hard to swallow.

483
00:25:37,302 --> 00:25:39,270
- You know?
- Yeah. Tell me about it.

484
00:25:39,371 --> 00:25:41,839
And you do everything?

485
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:46,400
Well, i believe in the old industry saying:

486
00:25:46,511 --> 00:25:49,139
Uh, never work with children or animals.

487
00:25:49,247 --> 00:25:51,875
What about... faking orgasms?

488
00:25:51,983 --> 00:25:54,747
No. No. I never fake an orgasm.

489
00:25:54,853 --> 00:25:57,378
That's just me though. You know? I mean...

490
00:25:57,489 --> 00:26:00,822
if i don't have an orgasm,
then i don't have an orgasm.

491
00:26:00,926 --> 00:26:03,326
I'm totally fascinated by...

492
00:26:05,196 --> 00:26:07,255
h-how did you get into this?

493
00:26:07,365 --> 00:26:10,823
- You obviously didn't go to school... for that.
- No.

494
00:26:10,936 --> 00:26:13,200
What was the first time like?

495
00:26:13,305 --> 00:26:16,832
W-w-what was going through
your head? H-how old were you?

496
00:26:16,942 --> 00:26:19,467
Um, i was 18.

497
00:26:19,578 --> 00:26:21,842
And, uh...

498
00:26:21,947 --> 00:26:23,710
hi. Uh...

499
00:26:23,815 --> 00:26:25,749
i'm moon. I have an appointment.

500
00:26:25,850 --> 00:26:28,648
Have a seat over here.

501
00:26:28,753 --> 00:26:31,221
Thank you.

502
00:26:53,712 --> 00:26:56,476
Are those, uh... porn oscars?

503
00:26:56,581 --> 00:26:58,276
Basically.

504
00:27:02,554 --> 00:27:04,715
What? For, uh... for best newcomer?

505
00:27:13,865 --> 00:27:15,492
Okay.

506
00:27:16,568 --> 00:27:18,593
You can go in now.

507
00:27:21,406 --> 00:27:23,306
You see these walls?

508
00:27:23,408 --> 00:27:25,467
Snapshot city.

509
00:27:25,577 --> 00:27:28,910
Everyday, girls send me pictures
from all over the country.

510
00:27:30,715 --> 00:27:33,843
Every kind of girl you can imagine.

511
00:27:33,952 --> 00:27:37,718
Here. Myra stein, burlington, vermont.

512
00:27:37,822 --> 00:27:40,188
"I want to be a star."

513
00:27:40,291 --> 00:27:42,851
A star.

514
00:27:42,961 --> 00:27:45,725
Taylor leigh, st. Louis, missouri.

515
00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:48,697
"I'm pierced and always wet."

516
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:50,427
Nice.

517
00:27:50,535 --> 00:27:52,503
Sounds like a weather report.

518
00:27:53,738 --> 00:27:56,229
Paula diamante, from brooklyn.

519
00:27:56,341 --> 00:27:59,572
She wants to work off her debts, and...

520
00:27:59,678 --> 00:28:01,145
claims she ejaculates.

521
00:28:01,246 --> 00:28:02,804
She what?

522
00:28:02,914 --> 00:28:06,873
I've got housewives, students, dancers...

523
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:10,888
i even got some religious nuts.

524
00:28:12,557 --> 00:28:16,755
What i'm saying is, there's no
shortage of talent. You get me?

525
00:28:16,861 --> 00:28:19,386
Yeah.

526
00:28:19,497 --> 00:28:20,623
Stand up.

527
00:28:23,935 --> 00:28:25,562
Open your dress.

528
00:28:27,472 --> 00:28:29,497
O... open my dress?

529
00:28:30,709 --> 00:28:32,734
It's porn, not fashion.

530
00:28:36,681 --> 00:28:38,308
Okay.

531
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:44,880
Sorry, i'm... a little nervous.

532
00:28:45,156 --> 00:28:47,124
It's okay.

533
00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:55,166
Good. Pull down your panties,
turn around, lift up your dress.

534
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:05,268
Okay. You can get dressed now, moon.

535
00:29:05,376 --> 00:29:07,173
Sit down.

536
00:29:08,913 --> 00:29:11,438
I supposed you want to know about the money.

537
00:29:11,549 --> 00:29:14,313
Everybody wants to know about the money.

538
00:29:14,419 --> 00:29:17,547
So, let me find my sex manual, here.

539
00:29:17,655 --> 00:29:19,316
Let me see.

540
00:29:19,424 --> 00:29:22,325
- It always changes, you see.
- Mm-hmm.

541
00:29:22,427 --> 00:29:25,828
Blowjobs are 200. intercourse, 800.

542
00:29:25,930 --> 00:29:28,797
Bi scenes, 600. it's gone up from five.

543
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:30,231
Anal, 1, 100.

544
00:29:30,335 --> 00:29:33,429
- Mm-hmm?
- What if i just, uh, want a sandwich?

545
00:29:33,538 --> 00:29:35,301
Two guys? That's a grand.

546
00:29:36,674 --> 00:29:38,835
With tomatoes, 1,200.

547
00:29:38,943 --> 00:29:41,844
Look. I'm not gonna lie to you.

548
00:29:41,946 --> 00:29:45,404
You could go very far. You could go to the top.

549
00:29:45,517 --> 00:29:47,849
You wanna know why?

550
00:29:47,952 --> 00:29:49,783
Why?

551
00:29:49,888 --> 00:29:53,221
Because you've got that pure, classy look.

552
00:29:53,324 --> 00:29:56,725
A girl who... could've been
a high school cheerleader.

553
00:29:56,828 --> 00:29:58,728
The girl every guy...

554
00:29:58,830 --> 00:30:01,890
wanted to take home to introduce to his mom.

555
00:30:04,669 --> 00:30:06,637
In a word...

556
00:30:07,672 --> 00:30:10,140
you're gold.

557
00:30:10,241 --> 00:30:12,869
- Thanks.
- You don't have to thank me. I'm...

558
00:30:12,977 --> 00:30:15,309
i'm not throwing you flowers.

559
00:30:16,648 --> 00:30:18,548
I'm telling it like it is.

560
00:30:18,650 --> 00:30:21,881
You got a righteous ass,
and it speaks for itself.

561
00:30:21,986 --> 00:30:23,283
"Hello."

562
00:30:25,423 --> 00:30:27,516
Moon...

563
00:30:27,625 --> 00:30:30,253
why do you want to do porn?

564
00:30:34,599 --> 00:30:36,567
I'm curious.

565
00:30:38,002 --> 00:30:40,800
That you are. And bless you for that.

566
00:30:40,905 --> 00:30:42,702
You like sex?

567
00:30:43,741 --> 00:30:45,709
I love sex.

568
00:30:50,448 --> 00:30:52,177
So, here's our studio.

569
00:30:52,283 --> 00:30:54,581
Okay?

570
00:30:54,686 --> 00:30:56,654
We have our european

571
00:30:56,754 --> 00:30:59,689
kind of funky, macabre look.

572
00:30:59,791 --> 00:31:03,488
And then over here, we have our... our nature.

573
00:31:06,231 --> 00:31:07,858
Sh.

574
00:31:31,990 --> 00:31:34,891
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Oh!

575
00:31:47,939 --> 00:31:49,964
What do you think?

576
00:32:46,998 --> 00:32:49,728
That day was a first for me.

577
00:32:49,834 --> 00:32:52,302
I'd never been with a woman before.

578
00:32:52,403 --> 00:32:53,893
Maybe it was fitting

579
00:32:54,005 --> 00:32:57,372
that a woman bring me into my first scene.

580
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:18,758
Could you ever date a porn star?

581
00:33:22,567 --> 00:33:24,535
I don't know.

582
00:33:27,472 --> 00:33:31,670
I mean... would you...
consider quitting the porn...

583
00:33:31,776 --> 00:33:35,610
industry altogether and having
a... a monogamous relationship?

584
00:33:38,449 --> 00:33:40,917
Hold that pregnant thought. Okay?

585
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:44,444
Hello?

586
00:33:44,555 --> 00:33:46,887
Kiska? Where are you?

587
00:33:46,991 --> 00:33:49,755
I'm with a new friend.

588
00:33:49,861 --> 00:33:51,260
Oh.

589
00:33:51,362 --> 00:33:53,830
Yeah. He cooked me dinner.

590
00:33:53,931 --> 00:33:56,923
I'm embarrassed... but i'm a mess.

591
00:33:57,201 --> 00:34:00,898
I tried to use the toilet, and
i couldn't get my zipper down,

592
00:34:01,172 --> 00:34:02,605
and i wet myself.

593
00:34:02,707 --> 00:34:04,572
My hands are shaking so much,

594
00:34:04,675 --> 00:34:08,167
and now, i'm... sitting here in my own...

595
00:34:08,279 --> 00:34:10,839
oh, pops, do...

596
00:34:10,948 --> 00:34:12,848
don't worry. I-i-i...

597
00:34:12,950 --> 00:34:15,817
i-i-i... i'll be home soon. Okay?

598
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:18,821
I-i-i'll be right there and i'll help you. All right?

599
00:34:18,923 --> 00:34:21,756
I love you. Bye.

600
00:34:24,662 --> 00:34:26,425
Is he okay?

601
00:34:26,531 --> 00:34:29,500
Yeah. He's, uh... thanks.

602
00:34:32,203 --> 00:34:33,932
Yeah, um...

603
00:34:34,205 --> 00:34:36,673
he's got parkinson's.

604
00:34:39,477 --> 00:34:42,776
It's difficult to see your own
father deteriorate. You know?

605
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:46,441
I know... i know all about it, actually. My...

606
00:34:46,551 --> 00:34:48,178
my aunt had-had the same thing.

607
00:34:48,286 --> 00:34:50,151
- Really?
- And she had the memory loss.

608
00:34:50,254 --> 00:34:54,588
And... that was terrible. What
was even worse than that was,

609
00:34:54,692 --> 00:34:55,920
she would have hallucinations, and...

610
00:34:56,194 --> 00:35:00,460
- oh.
- It just ripped your heart out. I'm sorry.

611
00:35:00,565 --> 00:35:04,524
I'm sorry. I... i just... i have... i have to go.

612
00:35:04,635 --> 00:35:08,093
Please. Do... don't even worry about it.

613
00:35:08,206 --> 00:35:09,833
But it is... kinda funny, actually.

614
00:35:09,941 --> 00:35:14,435
Go on a date with a porn star
and i don't even get laid.

615
00:35:14,545 --> 00:35:17,639
Well, actually, i never
have sex on the first date.

616
00:35:17,748 --> 00:35:21,741
I know it's kind of a paradox,
sex being my business, but...

617
00:35:21,853 --> 00:35:23,445
it's the way it goes.

618
00:35:23,554 --> 00:35:27,752
You know, actually, while i've
got an expert in my living room,

619
00:35:27,859 --> 00:35:29,918
i'm gonna ask: What's your favorite position?

620
00:35:30,194 --> 00:35:31,491
What do you think?

621
00:35:31,596 --> 00:35:34,929
Uh... i don't know. Maybe 69?

622
00:35:36,767 --> 00:35:39,861
Uh, well, close. Uh, 68.

623
00:35:39,971 --> 00:35:42,804
What's this? I don't even know what this is.

624
00:35:42,907 --> 00:35:46,399
Well, 68 is when, uh,
is when you go down on me...

625
00:35:46,511 --> 00:35:48,638
and then i owe you one.

626
00:35:49,981 --> 00:35:51,881
Made it into your pajamas.

627
00:35:51,983 --> 00:35:54,850
Hey. It's your birthday tomorrow. Remember?

628
00:35:54,952 --> 00:35:57,420
- Mm-hmm.
- We've got friends comin' over.

629
00:35:57,522 --> 00:36:00,685
I'm gonna make your favorite clam pasta.

630
00:36:00,791 --> 00:36:03,658
- Yeah. We have a lot of women coming over.
- All right.

631
00:36:03,761 --> 00:36:07,891
- You'll be a real ladies' man.
- Woo hoo.

632
00:36:08,166 --> 00:36:10,794
Cha-cha-cha.

633
00:36:10,902 --> 00:36:13,393
- Yeah.
- Oh, that's nice.

634
00:36:13,504 --> 00:36:15,529
- Hey, pops?
- Hmm?

635
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:17,540
I wish mom was here.

636
00:36:21,312 --> 00:36:23,212
Don't you hear me, pops?

637
00:36:23,314 --> 00:36:25,441
Don't talk about your mother.

638
00:36:25,550 --> 00:36:27,484
She left us.

639
00:36:27,585 --> 00:36:29,917
We weren't enough for her.

640
00:36:30,188 --> 00:36:32,156
She was like a...

641
00:36:32,256 --> 00:36:34,224
splinter in my eye.

642
00:36:34,325 --> 00:36:35,883
Like a splinter...

643
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:38,924
in my brain.

644
00:36:39,197 --> 00:36:41,859
I had to raise you... all by myself.

645
00:36:41,966 --> 00:36:43,866
You did a good job.

646
00:36:43,968 --> 00:36:47,404
Suicide is selfish, kiska.

647
00:36:47,505 --> 00:36:49,871
No sense of duty.

648
00:36:49,974 --> 00:36:53,774
Hey, you know? It's now okay,
because life is beautiful.

649
00:36:53,878 --> 00:36:55,505
No, you.

650
00:36:55,613 --> 00:36:58,878
You are so beautiful... kiska.

651
00:36:58,983 --> 00:37:00,814
You're not ugly like me.

652
00:37:00,918 --> 00:37:02,112
You are not ugly.

653
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:03,812
Nah, don't kid me. I'm ugly.

654
00:37:03,921 --> 00:37:05,115
No, you're not.

655
00:37:05,223 --> 00:37:07,157
I'm so ugly...

656
00:37:07,258 --> 00:37:11,558
i was on a walk, and this
dog tried to... hump my leg.

657
00:37:11,662 --> 00:37:13,892
- So?
- So, his eyes were closed.

658
00:37:14,165 --> 00:37:19,102
You know how ugly you have to be for a dog
to close his eyes when he humps your leg?

659
00:37:19,203 --> 00:37:21,501
No, pops.

660
00:37:28,713 --> 00:37:30,613
Ooh! Hey, y'all.

661
00:37:30,715 --> 00:37:33,479
Party over here. Party over here.

662
00:37:33,584 --> 00:37:35,848
- Hi.
- Hi.

663
00:37:35,953 --> 00:37:37,853
How are you?

664
00:37:37,955 --> 00:37:39,786
- Hello, girl.
- Hey.

665
00:37:39,890 --> 00:37:43,257
- Lookin' hot as usual.
- Thank you. Thank you.

666
00:37:43,361 --> 00:37:46,353
Hey, i got your dad a little somethin' somethin'.

667
00:37:46,464 --> 00:37:49,365
Oh, man, thank you. You didn't have to.

668
00:37:49,467 --> 00:37:51,697
You know, that's the whole thing about life.

669
00:37:51,802 --> 00:37:53,633
You don't have to do anything.

670
00:37:53,738 --> 00:37:54,864
I wanted to.

671
00:37:54,972 --> 00:37:56,769
Just like i wanted to have

672
00:37:56,874 --> 00:37:59,604
a couple of long island
ice teas before i came over.

673
00:37:59,710 --> 00:38:00,768
I'm sure you did.

674
00:38:00,878 --> 00:38:03,403
I got the party started a little early.

675
00:38:03,514 --> 00:38:07,075
Cheyenne, are you in the same
line of business as moon?

676
00:38:07,184 --> 00:38:09,812
Yeah. I actually was her first co-star.

677
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:13,117
- Really? How was that?
- It was great.

678
00:38:13,224 --> 00:38:16,785
- Do you mind if i ask why you do it?
- Honestly, it's a rush.

679
00:38:16,894 --> 00:38:19,488
I do it for the mother-fuckin' money.

680
00:38:19,597 --> 00:38:22,862
What job is gonna pay you four or five gs

681
00:38:23,134 --> 00:38:26,297
- to get your pussy purrin' for a couple days?
- I hear that.

682
00:38:26,404 --> 00:38:28,463
'Cause, the money makes
me a independent woman,

683
00:38:28,572 --> 00:38:30,665
and no man is gonna own my ass.

684
00:38:30,775 --> 00:38:32,572
By the way, my name is mal.

685
00:38:32,677 --> 00:38:33,871
Jessie, disaster with a knife.

686
00:38:34,145 --> 00:38:35,271
- Hey.
- Nice to meet you.

687
00:38:35,379 --> 00:38:37,677
Malpractice, maladjusted, but, ooh,

688
00:38:37,782 --> 00:38:39,682
never malicious, baby.

689
00:38:39,784 --> 00:38:40,751
He's coming.

690
00:38:46,490 --> 00:38:48,515
Surprise!

691
00:38:48,626 --> 00:38:50,856
Happy birthday!

692
00:38:50,961 --> 00:38:53,794
Are you having a going-away
party for somebody?

693
00:38:53,898 --> 00:38:55,559
It's your birthday, pops.

694
00:38:55,666 --> 00:38:56,894
Who's going away?

695
00:38:57,168 --> 00:38:58,897
- Have a seat.
- Okay. Okay.

696
00:38:59,170 --> 00:39:01,730
All right. Let's push you in.

697
00:39:04,909 --> 00:39:07,070
Help. Help. Help. Okay...

698
00:39:07,912 --> 00:39:09,880
make as wish! Ooh!

699
00:39:11,282 --> 00:39:14,410
Now, who say a man can't
give a good blow job? Hello.

700
00:39:14,518 --> 00:39:17,351
So, you guys, um,

701
00:39:17,455 --> 00:39:20,822
martine's one of my oldest
friends. We went to school.

702
00:39:20,925 --> 00:39:23,826
She's, uh, she' actually a law student now.

703
00:39:23,928 --> 00:39:26,158
She goes to one of the best schools.

704
00:39:26,263 --> 00:39:27,628
I'm very proud of her.

705
00:39:27,732 --> 00:39:29,825
Oh, you're one of those brainy mamas. Huh?

706
00:39:29,934 --> 00:39:31,299
Yeah, she is.

707
00:39:31,402 --> 00:39:34,838
Uh, no. This one was just as
smart as me. Probably smarter.

708
00:39:34,939 --> 00:39:37,305
- Come on.
- You used to get the top grades.

709
00:39:37,408 --> 00:39:39,603
Everyone used to cheat off of her.

710
00:39:39,710 --> 00:39:41,473
Do you remember that?

711
00:39:41,579 --> 00:39:42,841
Oh, my god.

712
00:39:42,947 --> 00:39:47,316
Yeah. She traded it all away
for a life sex and whorin'.

713
00:39:47,418 --> 00:39:48,851
Have you ever thought about that?

714
00:39:48,953 --> 00:39:50,853
Absolutely, i've thought about that.

715
00:39:50,955 --> 00:39:53,150
And i have my issues with the industry.

716
00:39:53,257 --> 00:39:56,124
The main one being that not
enough woman are directing.

717
00:39:56,227 --> 00:39:58,252
But i'm gonna get my chance in that.

718
00:39:58,362 --> 00:40:01,229
I'm gonna bring my own flavor into it.

719
00:40:01,332 --> 00:40:02,856
A little more eroticism,

720
00:40:02,967 --> 00:40:04,867
a little less straight to the pounding.

721
00:40:04,969 --> 00:40:07,164
Yes. But don't you think you're exploited?

722
00:40:07,271 --> 00:40:09,899
Aren't we all being exploited
on some level or another?

723
00:40:10,174 --> 00:40:12,870
I choose what i do. No one forces me.

724
00:40:12,977 --> 00:40:15,707
Women... normal women do not watch porn.

725
00:40:15,813 --> 00:40:19,715
I watch porn late at night
sometimes, and i'm a teacher.

726
00:40:19,817 --> 00:40:23,378
I like to play it in the
background while i mark papers.

727
00:40:23,487 --> 00:40:25,546
X, x, x.

728
00:40:25,656 --> 00:40:29,490
I'm sorry, but woman have died
so that we can vote and work.

729
00:40:29,593 --> 00:40:32,289
Do you honestly think
that you are good examples

730
00:40:32,396 --> 00:40:33,954
of how we've progressed from cultures

731
00:40:34,231 --> 00:40:36,825
where we're frequently nothing
more than baby machines,

732
00:40:36,934 --> 00:40:39,459
and, in some areas, actually
still getting circumcised,

733
00:40:39,570 --> 00:40:41,538
to being civilized women?

734
00:40:41,639 --> 00:40:43,266
I felt that way before.

735
00:40:44,675 --> 00:40:47,337
You felt like a civilized woman?

736
00:40:47,445 --> 00:40:49,913
I had a job as a lawyer,

737
00:40:50,014 --> 00:40:51,914
before i had parkinson's disease,

738
00:40:52,016 --> 00:40:53,506
in africa.

739
00:40:53,617 --> 00:40:56,415
Ooh, hakuna matata.
So, you came to my homeland?

740
00:40:56,520 --> 00:40:59,580
True story. I'm in morocco
and i gotta take a shit

741
00:40:59,690 --> 00:41:02,454
so, so bad, and they have
this thing in morocco,

742
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:05,859
just this fence, like a board
and a hole in the ground.

743
00:41:05,963 --> 00:41:09,330
So, i'm there and i'm squatting,
and there's people walking by,

744
00:41:09,433 --> 00:41:12,129
and they watch while i'm taking a crap!

745
00:41:12,236 --> 00:41:13,863
I gotta go really bad.

746
00:41:13,971 --> 00:41:17,702
I'd been eating this baba ganoush and tabouli.

747
00:41:17,808 --> 00:41:19,673
No. Wait a minute.

748
00:41:19,777 --> 00:41:21,506
And i'm taking a crap,

749
00:41:21,612 --> 00:41:24,775
and it's like molecular acid
or something coming out my ass.

750
00:41:24,882 --> 00:41:27,146
And i... i reach over, there's no toilet paper.

751
00:41:27,251 --> 00:41:29,617
And i'm squatting, it's all down my leg,

752
00:41:29,720 --> 00:41:32,883
and as i do, i take my crap and it says...

753
00:41:32,990 --> 00:41:35,788
there's a slit in the wall, and over it it said,

754
00:41:35,893 --> 00:41:38,885
it says, "wipe your ass with your hand,

755
00:41:38,996 --> 00:41:41,829
"and when you're done, put it through this slit,

756
00:41:41,932 --> 00:41:44,594
and it will be licked clean by human lips."

757
00:41:44,702 --> 00:41:45,896
And i go, "ugh!"

758
00:41:47,805 --> 00:41:51,172
But it really burned,
so i wiped my hand like this,

759
00:41:51,275 --> 00:41:53,903
and there's the slit, and i put it through,

760
00:41:54,011 --> 00:41:58,607
and the guy on the other side hits it
with a hammer, and i go, "mmm! Mmm!"

761
00:42:00,818 --> 00:42:03,480
You know, i miss... i miss dancing with kiska.

762
00:42:03,587 --> 00:42:05,612
We use to dance all the time.

763
00:42:05,723 --> 00:42:06,747
Aw.

764
00:42:06,857 --> 00:42:07,846
What kind of dancing?

765
00:42:07,958 --> 00:42:11,724
Oh, waltz. And we'd swing
a little bit. Swing dance.

766
00:42:11,829 --> 00:42:14,662
- Dirty dancin'?
- No. No, no.

767
00:42:16,967 --> 00:42:18,559
- Music.
- Yeah.

768
00:42:18,669 --> 00:42:20,136
I'm gonna get the music.

769
00:42:20,237 --> 00:42:23,172
Come on, pops. Get up. We're dancing.

770
00:42:23,274 --> 00:42:25,265
Come up. One, two, three.

771
00:42:25,376 --> 00:42:26,866
All right.

772
00:42:26,977 --> 00:42:30,640
Come on, pops, show me.

773
00:42:30,748 --> 00:42:33,410
- Can i talk to you for a second?
- Yeah. What?

774
00:42:33,517 --> 00:42:35,815
I mean, can i talk to you in private?

775
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:37,251
Uh, yeah. Sure.

776
00:42:38,255 --> 00:42:40,655
- I got the moves.
- Woo woo!

777
00:42:43,894 --> 00:42:46,362
Sit. Sit, sit, sit.

778
00:42:46,463 --> 00:42:48,761
Remember, i told you about that teacher

779
00:42:48,866 --> 00:42:50,925
at my school that i had a crush on?

780
00:42:51,201 --> 00:42:53,897
Daniel taylor, that asked
me out on a few dates?

781
00:42:54,004 --> 00:42:56,234
- Yeah.
- Well...

782
00:42:56,340 --> 00:42:58,205
we went out a couple of times,

783
00:42:58,309 --> 00:42:59,901
and we connected on this level

784
00:43:00,010 --> 00:43:01,841
i've never connected with anyone before.

785
00:43:01,946 --> 00:43:03,846
And, moon, he's got it all.

786
00:43:03,948 --> 00:43:05,848
He's everything i've ever looked for.

787
00:43:05,950 --> 00:43:07,645
The complete package.

788
00:43:07,751 --> 00:43:08,718
You checked his package?

789
00:43:08,819 --> 00:43:10,582
Of course i checked his package.

790
00:43:10,688 --> 00:43:11,746
It's... it's good?

791
00:43:11,855 --> 00:43:13,186
It's good.

792
00:43:13,290 --> 00:43:14,450
Uh-huh?

793
00:43:14,558 --> 00:43:17,618
Anyway, um, two days ago,

794
00:43:17,728 --> 00:43:19,662
he asked me to get engaged.

795
00:43:19,763 --> 00:43:22,630
So, you're engaged? Baby, that's great.

796
00:43:24,535 --> 00:43:25,866
- I didn't say yes.
- Wow.

797
00:43:25,970 --> 00:43:28,837
What do you mean? You said no?

798
00:43:28,939 --> 00:43:31,635
No. I said i need some time to think about it.

799
00:43:31,742 --> 00:43:34,939
That's smart? Well, how did he take it?

800
00:43:35,212 --> 00:43:37,305
He said to take my time.

801
00:43:37,414 --> 00:43:39,882
So, what's the problem?

802
00:43:39,984 --> 00:43:41,713
What's wrong?

803
00:43:41,819 --> 00:43:43,719
It's not really a problem.

804
00:43:43,821 --> 00:43:47,882
It's more like a favor that i need to ask of you.

805
00:43:47,992 --> 00:43:50,893
Anything, babe. What's... what's...

806
00:43:50,995 --> 00:43:52,360
what do you need?

807
00:43:52,463 --> 00:43:54,658
I want you to test him out for me.

808
00:43:54,765 --> 00:43:56,665
Test him? What like a test drive?

809
00:43:56,767 --> 00:44:00,828
I want you to find out
if he'd cheat on me, moon.

810
00:44:00,938 --> 00:44:04,704
You know, stay faithful, before i marry him.

811
00:44:04,808 --> 00:44:06,708
Uh-huh?

812
00:44:06,810 --> 00:44:10,143
Look. He doesn't know you. You've never met.

813
00:44:10,247 --> 00:44:12,272
No. What are you talking about?

814
00:44:12,383 --> 00:44:14,146
You want me to fuck your fiance?

815
00:44:14,251 --> 00:44:16,879
No. If you could just
be somewhere where he is.

816
00:44:17,154 --> 00:44:19,315
I know he grabs a coffee after work,

817
00:44:19,423 --> 00:44:20,856
or maybe at the gym.

818
00:44:20,958 --> 00:44:22,858
And, no. Not come on to him.

819
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:25,258
Just, maybe... make yourself available,

820
00:44:25,362 --> 00:44:27,227
or...

821
00:44:28,565 --> 00:44:32,262
or come on to him and see if he bites.

822
00:44:32,369 --> 00:44:34,837
Holy shit. That's him.

823
00:44:34,938 --> 00:44:37,406
You want me...

824
00:44:37,508 --> 00:44:40,944
to see if your fiance
will cheat on you with me?

825
00:44:41,979 --> 00:44:43,913
I mean...

826
00:44:44,181 --> 00:44:47,207
i wanna know if he would stay faithful.

827
00:44:47,317 --> 00:44:50,218
It would be better for me to know now,

828
00:44:50,320 --> 00:44:54,416
than... after we're married,
one or two kids later.

829
00:44:54,525 --> 00:44:56,390
Don't you think?

830
00:44:56,493 --> 00:44:58,586
You're the perfect and only person

831
00:44:58,696 --> 00:45:01,256
i could ask to do something like this.

832
00:45:01,365 --> 00:45:03,265
Sex is your business, moon.

833
00:45:03,367 --> 00:45:06,427
Okay. Let's think this through out loud.
Okay?

834
00:45:06,537 --> 00:45:08,630
He's at, uh, getting a coffee,

835
00:45:08,739 --> 00:45:10,866
and i, uh, come on to him.

836
00:45:11,141 --> 00:45:14,577
Excuse me. I'm s... i'm sorry.
Is anyone sitting here?

837
00:45:14,678 --> 00:45:16,908
- No.
- Do you mind if i sit down?

838
00:45:17,181 --> 00:45:19,649
- No. Carry on.
- Thank you.

839
00:45:21,952 --> 00:45:25,353
Isn't it human nature for him to flirt with me?

840
00:45:25,456 --> 00:45:26,787
Flirting's not cheating.

841
00:45:26,890 --> 00:45:29,222
At what point am i stopping him?

842
00:45:29,326 --> 00:45:31,351
I think for me, it would be

843
00:45:31,462 --> 00:45:32,861
at the point of entry.

844
00:45:32,963 --> 00:45:35,557
What?

845
00:45:35,666 --> 00:45:37,133
Point of entry of what?

846
00:45:37,234 --> 00:45:38,929
A finger, a penis.

847
00:45:40,604 --> 00:45:42,936
Or, god forbid, a tongue.

848
00:45:47,377 --> 00:45:49,470
Exc... excuse me. I'm sorry.

849
00:45:49,580 --> 00:45:51,309
Are you done with this section?

850
00:45:51,415 --> 00:45:52,746
'Course. Yeah.

851
00:45:52,850 --> 00:45:54,613
- Do you mind?
- Go ahead.

852
00:45:54,718 --> 00:45:56,845
You know, i don't know why anyone

853
00:45:56,954 --> 00:45:59,684
would wanna read the newspaper these days.

854
00:45:59,790 --> 00:46:01,781
The news is so depressing. Right?

855
00:46:01,892 --> 00:46:03,723
Right.

856
00:46:03,827 --> 00:46:07,388
You know, after september 11th,
nothing's really been the same.

857
00:46:07,498 --> 00:46:09,864
I hope one of those guys doesn't come in

858
00:46:10,134 --> 00:46:11,829
with one of those suitcase nukes.

859
00:46:11,935 --> 00:46:14,301
Can you imagine, waking up one morning,

860
00:46:14,404 --> 00:46:17,896
finding that washington
or san francisco is gone?

861
00:46:20,410 --> 00:46:23,777
Well, a little light afternoon's conversation.

862
00:46:23,881 --> 00:46:27,214
I'm... i'm sorry. I was just...

863
00:46:27,317 --> 00:46:30,218
i'm sorry. I-i-i'm bond. I was just venting.

864
00:46:30,320 --> 00:46:31,844
No, no, no. It's okay.

865
00:46:31,955 --> 00:46:34,788
Um, sorry, um, did you say, bond?

866
00:46:34,892 --> 00:46:37,827
Yeah. Don't worry. It's not short for "bondage."

867
00:46:37,928 --> 00:46:39,486
No. That's a cool name.

868
00:46:39,596 --> 00:46:40,927
Thanks.

869
00:46:42,699 --> 00:46:45,497
So, uh... where are you from?

870
00:46:45,602 --> 00:46:49,868
Well, i'm from wales,
originally, but i live here now.

871
00:46:49,973 --> 00:46:51,304
And you?

872
00:46:51,408 --> 00:46:52,875
I'm from new orleans.

873
00:46:52,976 --> 00:46:56,571
I'm just, uh, here for
the weekend visiting a friend.

874
00:46:56,680 --> 00:47:00,810
It's kind of interesting not
knowing anyone in the city.

875
00:47:00,918 --> 00:47:02,886
Not knowing where to... walk.

876
00:47:04,454 --> 00:47:07,548
It... it is safe to... to walk around here. Right?

877
00:47:07,658 --> 00:47:08,818
I mean, for a girl?

878
00:47:08,926 --> 00:47:11,190
Well, it depends on the neighborhood, really.

879
00:47:11,295 --> 00:47:13,889
But, uh... i wouldn't advise doing it late at
night.

880
00:47:14,164 --> 00:47:17,895
Are you more of a first-thing-
in-the-morning kinda guy?

881
00:47:21,405 --> 00:47:22,838
Sometimes.

882
00:47:22,940 --> 00:47:26,842
So, what do you do when you're
not drinking, uh, ice coffees?

883
00:47:26,944 --> 00:47:28,411
Wait. Let me guess.

884
00:47:29,479 --> 00:47:32,209
You have a strong jaw,

885
00:47:32,316 --> 00:47:35,752
brown hair, chocolate eyes...

886
00:47:35,853 --> 00:47:38,845
you like helping people.

887
00:47:38,956 --> 00:47:40,253
True.

888
00:47:40,357 --> 00:47:43,349
Your work is about problem-solving,

889
00:47:43,460 --> 00:47:47,590
and sometimes... you have
to take your work home with you.

890
00:47:47,698 --> 00:47:49,256
Kinda like homework.

891
00:47:49,366 --> 00:47:52,392
Sometimes you have
to look at your work intensely.

892
00:47:53,804 --> 00:47:57,570
A lot of hand motions like, uh... like this.

893
00:47:59,710 --> 00:48:02,440
Wow. Uh, you're good.

894
00:48:02,546 --> 00:48:04,446
You're a gynecologist.

895
00:48:04,548 --> 00:48:07,608
Almost. Uh, i'm a teacher.

896
00:48:07,718 --> 00:48:09,276
- Really?
- Yeah.

897
00:48:09,386 --> 00:48:11,820
Wow. That's great.

898
00:48:11,922 --> 00:48:14,686
So, uh, we forgot to do
the ritual. Shake hands?

899
00:48:14,791 --> 00:48:15,815
Oh. Right.

900
00:48:15,926 --> 00:48:17,416
Shall we?

901
00:48:17,527 --> 00:48:19,256
Of course.

902
00:48:19,363 --> 00:48:22,491
Mmm. Strong, uh... strong grip.

903
00:48:23,367 --> 00:48:24,834
I wonder why we do it.

904
00:48:24,935 --> 00:48:26,562
- Shake hands?
- Yeah.

905
00:48:26,670 --> 00:48:29,138
I've never seen any other animals do it.

906
00:48:29,239 --> 00:48:31,469
I guess it's better than sniffing asses. Right?

907
00:48:31,575 --> 00:48:35,341
I'd like to see some politicians
doing that on their campaign.

908
00:48:35,445 --> 00:48:37,640
Having to sniff hundreds of asses to get votes?

909
00:48:37,748 --> 00:48:40,273
Absolutely. Yeah.

910
00:48:45,289 --> 00:48:48,122
Well, um...

911
00:48:48,225 --> 00:48:51,456
it was nice to meet
someone who wasn't acting.

912
00:48:51,561 --> 00:48:53,461
Yes.

913
00:48:53,563 --> 00:48:57,431
And, uh, well, i hope you have
a great stay here. And, uh...

914
00:48:57,534 --> 00:49:00,765
i'll think about the gynecology.
Maybe there's an opening for me.

915
00:49:02,306 --> 00:49:04,331
Okay.

916
00:49:07,911 --> 00:49:10,607
Uh, daniel?

917
00:49:10,714 --> 00:49:15,151
I don't mean to sound weird, but, uh...

918
00:49:15,252 --> 00:49:19,188
do you think you could give me
a ride to where i'm staying?

919
00:49:19,289 --> 00:49:21,757
It's not... it's not far from here.

920
00:49:23,360 --> 00:49:25,851
I just... it's just that it's... it's getting dark soon,

921
00:49:26,129 --> 00:49:29,428
and, you know, you said that i shouldn't walk.

922
00:49:33,603 --> 00:49:35,230
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

923
00:49:38,942 --> 00:49:43,174
Hey, uh, daniel? Can i, uh...
can i come clean with you?

924
00:49:43,280 --> 00:49:44,907
Sure.

925
00:49:46,183 --> 00:49:48,117
Um...

926
00:49:52,322 --> 00:49:54,620
i find you very attractive.

927
00:49:58,962 --> 00:50:01,556
Thank you. Me, too.

928
00:50:01,665 --> 00:50:03,929
You find yourself attractive?

929
00:50:05,736 --> 00:50:07,829
No.

930
00:50:07,938 --> 00:50:10,566
No. You know what i mean. I, uh...

931
00:50:12,576 --> 00:50:14,544
i feel the chemistry.

932
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:18,380
Do you have a girlfriend?

933
00:50:18,482 --> 00:50:20,450
Well, i...

934
00:50:24,888 --> 00:50:27,448
you know what? It doesn't matter.

935
00:50:27,557 --> 00:50:30,355
I'm only in town for one more night.

936
00:51:05,362 --> 00:51:06,920
Warm in here. Right?

937
00:51:07,197 --> 00:51:08,926
Uh-huh.

938
00:51:11,401 --> 00:51:13,926
Maybe you should take these off.

939
00:51:15,939 --> 00:51:17,770
Okay.

940
00:51:52,776 --> 00:51:54,971
Oh, shit.

941
00:51:56,480 --> 00:51:59,347
- Is that mine?
- No. It's-lt's mine.

942
00:52:00,784 --> 00:52:03,514
Hey, pops. W-w-what's the matter?

943
00:52:03,620 --> 00:52:05,850
You sound different. Where are you?

944
00:52:05,956 --> 00:52:09,119
I'm in the car in l.a. It's my father.

945
00:52:09,226 --> 00:52:10,750
Tell him i say hi.

946
00:52:10,861 --> 00:52:11,850
Who's that?

947
00:52:11,962 --> 00:52:14,863
I'm with a new friend.

948
00:52:14,965 --> 00:52:16,865
Yeah.

949
00:52:16,967 --> 00:52:18,867
- Tell him you taste great.
- Sh.

950
00:52:18,969 --> 00:52:20,698
Are you coming back soon?

951
00:52:20,804 --> 00:52:23,272
Because i thought we were going for a walk.

952
00:52:23,373 --> 00:52:25,307
Yeah. We will.

953
00:52:25,408 --> 00:52:26,568
I cut my neck.

954
00:52:26,676 --> 00:52:29,372
Your neck?

955
00:52:29,479 --> 00:52:31,777
Are you okay? Is it bad?

956
00:52:31,882 --> 00:52:33,816
Pops.

957
00:52:33,917 --> 00:52:35,350
Po...

958
00:52:35,452 --> 00:52:36,885
fuck.

959
00:52:36,987 --> 00:52:38,784
Um...

960
00:52:38,889 --> 00:52:41,517
i have to... i gotta go.

961
00:52:41,625 --> 00:52:43,593
I'm sorry.

962
00:52:44,794 --> 00:52:47,160
Look. I, uh... i understand.

963
00:52:48,865 --> 00:52:50,594
I'm sorry. It's just...

964
00:52:50,700 --> 00:52:51,894
it's my dad. You know?

965
00:52:52,002 --> 00:52:54,266
No. Sure. Look, uh...

966
00:52:54,371 --> 00:52:57,568
this was a mistake. I'm sorry.

967
00:52:57,674 --> 00:52:59,608
I hope your dad's okay.

968
00:52:59,709 --> 00:53:03,110
Look. I can still drive you to wherever you...

969
00:53:03,213 --> 00:53:05,272
no, no. Uh, no. You know what? I...

970
00:53:05,382 --> 00:53:07,646
i better walk, 'cause i-i gotta call him back.

971
00:53:07,751 --> 00:53:10,811
He's, uh... he's-he's by himself at home.

972
00:53:10,921 --> 00:53:12,252
Thank you, though.

973
00:53:12,355 --> 00:53:14,289
- Bye.
- Good-bye.

974
00:53:36,680 --> 00:53:38,671
I'm not a man anymore.

975
00:53:39,716 --> 00:53:42,184
I've lost my independence.

976
00:53:44,354 --> 00:53:45,878
I know my...

977
00:53:45,989 --> 00:53:49,288
memory is slowly...

978
00:53:49,392 --> 00:53:52,555
slipping away like water down the drain.

979
00:53:52,662 --> 00:53:53,890
Pops.

980
00:53:55,665 --> 00:53:56,893
Stop it.

981
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:59,230
Sometimes i feel like i'm slipping away.

982
00:54:02,272 --> 00:54:04,706
I wish i had a plug, moon.

983
00:54:04,808 --> 00:54:07,504
All my... knowledge.

984
00:54:08,812 --> 00:54:12,509
I spent a lifetime learning. All my experiences.

985
00:54:12,616 --> 00:54:14,675
What for?

986
00:54:14,784 --> 00:54:17,685
It's all just slowly going down the drain.

987
00:54:17,787 --> 00:54:21,746
Pops, what are you talking about? Stop it.

988
00:54:21,858 --> 00:54:23,758
Listen. You're great.

989
00:54:23,860 --> 00:54:26,192
Okay? Maybe you need to be more social.

990
00:54:26,296 --> 00:54:28,321
- Go out on a few dates.
- Dates?

991
00:54:28,431 --> 00:54:30,524
You're still handsome. You know that?

992
00:54:30,634 --> 00:54:33,831
I can never be disloyal to your mother.

993
00:54:35,639 --> 00:54:39,700
Hey. Why don't you watch tv? The news is
on.

994
00:54:39,809 --> 00:54:42,277
News? There is no news, kiska.

995
00:54:42,379 --> 00:54:44,347
It's all olds.

996
00:54:44,447 --> 00:54:45,880
- Hey.
- Hey. Your room.

997
00:54:45,982 --> 00:54:47,950
Now.

998
00:54:53,657 --> 00:54:56,751
Well... i'm single now.

999
00:54:56,860 --> 00:54:58,384
Goddamn it.

1000
00:54:58,495 --> 00:55:00,292
Back to serial dating.

1001
00:55:00,397 --> 00:55:01,796
To get a woman to cheat,

1002
00:55:01,898 --> 00:55:04,366
you need to be more time-intensive.

1003
00:55:04,467 --> 00:55:07,834
You know? You need to seduce
them and put in quality time.

1004
00:55:07,937 --> 00:55:09,837
I think it boils down to anatomy.

1005
00:55:09,939 --> 00:55:12,533
Men have a dick and they
are sticking it into something.

1006
00:55:12,642 --> 00:55:14,166
It's less personal.

1007
00:55:14,277 --> 00:55:17,644
Women, you're inviting them into
your body. That's very personal.

1008
00:55:17,747 --> 00:55:20,477
But it's also the emotional aspect of it.

1009
00:55:20,583 --> 00:55:22,210
Okay.

1010
00:55:22,319 --> 00:55:24,549
Women need a reason to cheat.

1011
00:55:24,654 --> 00:55:26,849
Men need a reason not to.

1012
00:55:26,956 --> 00:55:31,552
I guess you could say we both
had a revelation that day.

1013
00:55:31,661 --> 00:55:34,596
I felt a calling, like i was meant to do this.

1014
00:55:34,698 --> 00:55:35,926
At least for a while.

1015
00:55:36,199 --> 00:55:39,498
And it's really weird, because...

1016
00:55:39,602 --> 00:55:43,732
there's some connection between
what i've been doing and this new job.

1017
00:55:43,840 --> 00:55:47,833
So, i've taken out this ad.
Tell me what you think.

1018
00:55:47,944 --> 00:55:49,878
The s. I.a.

1019
00:55:49,979 --> 00:55:52,447
The sex intelligence agency.

1020
00:55:52,549 --> 00:55:55,313
"Do you need the services of the s. I.a.?

1021
00:55:55,418 --> 00:55:57,443
"Are you sure your lover's faithful?

1022
00:55:57,554 --> 00:55:59,545
Will they pass the test?"

1023
00:55:59,656 --> 00:56:02,147
My phone has been ringing off the hook.

1024
00:56:02,258 --> 00:56:06,820
My answering machine's about
to have a hernia. I kid you not.

1025
00:56:06,930 --> 00:56:09,831
I've taken interviews from all kinds of people.

1026
00:56:09,933 --> 00:56:13,460
Okay. So, i've been married nine years,

1027
00:56:13,570 --> 00:56:17,199
but he's at the office very late every single day.

1028
00:56:17,307 --> 00:56:20,765
And you have to ask yourself,
how much work is there to do?

1029
00:56:20,877 --> 00:56:23,903
I just want to know if
he'd cheat on me with a woman.

1030
00:56:24,180 --> 00:56:26,910
You know? I mean...

1031
00:56:27,183 --> 00:56:29,777
that would be the ultimate betrayal.

1032
00:56:29,886 --> 00:56:32,150
He's always on his cell phone.

1033
00:56:32,255 --> 00:56:34,917
But, if we are out, he is never answering it.

1034
00:56:35,191 --> 00:56:38,160
He just lets it ring. It is forever ringing.

1035
00:56:38,261 --> 00:56:41,856
I am worried that my wife might
give it up to a man with more money.

1036
00:56:41,965 --> 00:56:43,865
With hair.

1037
00:56:43,967 --> 00:56:47,266
Who's got... breasts.

1038
00:56:47,370 --> 00:56:49,133
He doesn't even have a fucking job.

1039
00:56:49,239 --> 00:56:51,207
I've been supportin' his ass for months.

1040
00:56:51,307 --> 00:56:53,867
Whatever. It doesn't matter.
Just, i need to know.

1041
00:56:53,977 --> 00:56:55,706
Do you take checks?

1042
00:56:55,812 --> 00:56:58,474
I've been tryin' to get
myself prepared to provide

1043
00:56:58,581 --> 00:57:00,674
a more professional service.

1044
00:57:00,784 --> 00:57:02,513
For instance...

1045
00:57:02,619 --> 00:57:05,087
how much do i charge?

1046
00:57:05,188 --> 00:57:07,554
Is-ls a grand too much?

1047
00:57:07,657 --> 00:57:11,115
I mean, what is this type
of information worth?

1048
00:57:14,164 --> 00:57:18,533
Anyhow, i've got three s.i.a.
Jobs lined up for this week.

1049
00:57:18,635 --> 00:57:22,332
How does that work,
the video shirt-button cam?

1050
00:57:22,439 --> 00:57:23,906
- Oh.
- What is that?

1051
00:57:24,174 --> 00:57:25,835
Actually, um, i-i-i'm new here.

1052
00:57:25,942 --> 00:57:27,842
This is my uncle john's store...

1053
00:57:27,944 --> 00:57:29,809
- is he here?
- Yeah.

1054
00:57:29,913 --> 00:57:31,312
- Uncle john?
- Oh, perfect.

1055
00:57:31,414 --> 00:57:33,382
I mean john.

1056
00:57:34,350 --> 00:57:36,181
We try not to be all family...

1057
00:57:36,286 --> 00:57:38,379
- be a professional. I hear you.
- Yeah.

1058
00:57:38,488 --> 00:57:40,115
- Hello.
- Hello.

1059
00:57:40,223 --> 00:57:43,624
Uh, can you tell me how to...
how does that work right there?

1060
00:57:43,726 --> 00:57:44,852
'Cause that looks...

1061
00:57:44,961 --> 00:57:47,657
- the button camera?
- Yeah.

1062
00:57:47,764 --> 00:57:49,664
Oops. Excuse me, jason.

1063
00:57:49,766 --> 00:57:52,166
- It's basically a black-and-white camera.
- Mm-hmm.

1064
00:57:52,268 --> 00:57:55,499
Lines coming out feed into
your video deck that you wear,

1065
00:57:55,605 --> 00:57:58,233
giving you about 420 lines of resolution.

1066
00:57:58,341 --> 00:58:00,502
That is perfect.

1067
00:58:03,379 --> 00:58:06,280
Okay. So, i have the spy-cam built into my
cap.

1068
00:58:06,382 --> 00:58:09,112
I spent all night trying to set it up and rig it

1069
00:58:09,219 --> 00:58:12,120
so it can be viewed from the emblem.

1070
00:58:12,222 --> 00:58:16,818
Look at this. It's got a little
camera here with the antenna.

1071
00:58:16,926 --> 00:58:19,827
See? And then it clips right in there.

1072
00:58:19,929 --> 00:58:21,453
Like that.

1073
00:58:22,765 --> 00:58:24,824
Okay. Here we go.

1074
00:58:38,815 --> 00:58:40,840
I've been going backwards and forwards about

1075
00:58:40,950 --> 00:58:43,817
whether or not i should re-sign
with primal for another year.

1076
00:58:43,920 --> 00:58:47,651
It's not that i have any ill
feelings towards the industry.

1077
00:58:47,757 --> 00:58:50,590
And the money's guaranteed
to support me and pops.

1078
00:58:50,693 --> 00:58:54,322
But it's just that business is really taking off.

1079
00:58:54,430 --> 00:58:56,921
And i'm the one calling all the shots.

1080
00:58:57,200 --> 00:58:59,668
I'm directing now,

1081
00:58:59,769 --> 00:59:02,602
and i've got clients
coming out of the woodwork.

1082
00:59:02,705 --> 00:59:07,506
I would like to be so bold as to
get you to come a little closer.

1083
00:59:09,479 --> 00:59:12,073
And place my hand that's moist,

1084
00:59:12,181 --> 00:59:14,479
feel the firmness of your skin.

1085
00:59:15,885 --> 00:59:17,819
Inner thigh.

1086
00:59:19,722 --> 00:59:24,182
And then gently, slightly
move over a little higher.

1087
00:59:25,461 --> 00:59:27,622
Does that feel good?

1088
00:59:27,730 --> 00:59:30,699
Because if it... if it feels offensive,

1089
00:59:30,800 --> 00:59:32,631
i'll stop and chop that hand off.

1090
00:59:32,735 --> 00:59:34,635
I don't have a problem with that.

1091
00:59:36,239 --> 00:59:38,764
I can't say it doesn't feel good.

1092
00:59:40,910 --> 00:59:42,138
Okay.

1093
00:59:42,245 --> 00:59:44,805
'Cause i gotta be honest with you.

1094
00:59:44,914 --> 00:59:47,109
I am married. Human.

1095
00:59:48,885 --> 00:59:52,753
I love my wife very much
and i am never gonna leave her.

1096
00:59:52,855 --> 00:59:55,847
This is just about sex, pure and simple.

1097
00:59:55,959 --> 00:59:57,483
Pure sex.

1098
00:59:57,594 --> 00:59:59,892
You still down with that?

1099
01:00:03,199 --> 01:00:04,496
Hello?

1100
01:00:04,601 --> 01:00:06,296
Moon, what're you doin' right now?

1101
01:00:06,402 --> 01:00:07,562
Hey, cheyenne. What's goin' on?

1102
01:00:07,670 --> 01:00:08,864
I need to talk.

1103
01:00:08,972 --> 01:00:10,371
Will you meet me later?

1104
01:00:10,473 --> 01:00:12,236
Yeah. Okay. When?

1105
01:00:12,342 --> 01:00:15,869
- Meet me at the... at the clinic at six.
- What're you, pregnant?

1106
01:00:15,979 --> 01:00:17,810
Just meet me there. All right?

1107
01:00:17,914 --> 01:00:19,472
Yeah. Okay. All right.

1108
01:01:05,728 --> 01:01:07,457
Hey.

1109
01:01:07,563 --> 01:01:10,589
- Oh, thank god you're here.
- Hey, baby. I'm sorry i'm late.

1110
01:01:10,700 --> 01:01:13,498
What's wrong? What's with all the urgency?

1111
01:01:13,603 --> 01:01:16,629
You remember that scene
that we did in april with steve kellis?

1112
01:01:16,739 --> 01:01:19,867
- Mm-hmm.
- We both did a scene with him.

1113
01:01:19,976 --> 01:01:22,501
Yeah. So?

1114
01:01:22,612 --> 01:01:26,878
Kobi found out that he's come down with aids.

1115
01:01:26,983 --> 01:01:28,814
Excuse me?

1116
01:01:28,918 --> 01:01:31,853
Why do you think
i asked you to meet me here?

1117
01:01:31,954 --> 01:01:33,888
I took my test. I'm waiting for the results.

1118
01:01:33,990 --> 01:01:35,651
- You need to get yours.
- Wait...

1119
01:01:35,758 --> 01:01:37,350
i'm freaking out here.

1120
01:01:37,460 --> 01:01:38,688
Calm down. All right?

1121
01:01:38,795 --> 01:01:40,660
I saw the certificate with my own eyes.

1122
01:01:40,763 --> 01:01:42,731
So did i. He faked it.

1123
01:01:42,832 --> 01:01:45,892
He-he probably paid some
bent doctor to sign it off.

1124
01:01:46,002 --> 01:01:47,970
I don't know.

1125
01:01:49,672 --> 01:01:51,469
Son of a dick.

1126
01:01:51,574 --> 01:01:54,737
All right. Just to fill
you in on the whole testing thing,

1127
01:01:54,844 --> 01:01:57,335
five years ago when i started in the industry,

1128
01:01:57,447 --> 01:01:59,642
they were still using the old hiv test,

1129
01:01:59,749 --> 01:02:01,842
the eliza test, which has
a three-month window.

1130
01:02:01,951 --> 01:02:05,648
Now, thank god, they're
using the dna test by pcr,

1131
01:02:05,755 --> 01:02:07,586
which only has a 24-hour window.

1132
01:02:07,690 --> 01:02:09,590
You get tested every 30 days.

1133
01:02:11,861 --> 01:02:13,488
Hello, moon?

1134
01:02:13,596 --> 01:02:15,291
- Yeah.
- Hi.

1135
01:02:15,398 --> 01:02:17,764
Your friend cheyenne, here,
made an appointment for you.

1136
01:02:17,867 --> 01:02:20,859
And we're ready for you. Can you follow me?

1137
01:03:03,946 --> 01:03:06,471
Hello guys. Looking good.

1138
01:03:06,582 --> 01:03:09,676
Everybody's in blue jeans. What's with this?

1139
01:03:11,287 --> 01:03:12,879
Mr. A.?

1140
01:03:13,156 --> 01:03:14,783
I'll be right there.

1141
01:03:14,891 --> 01:03:16,756
All right, guys. Have a good time.

1142
01:03:16,859 --> 01:03:19,851
Have yourself some food. Not too
much. Don't wanna gain weight.

1143
01:03:19,962 --> 01:03:21,930
What's up, guys? Keep it goin'.

1144
01:03:28,871 --> 01:03:30,668
What's up?

1145
01:03:31,741 --> 01:03:33,538
Nothing.

1146
01:03:34,977 --> 01:03:36,945
What's the matter?

1147
01:03:37,980 --> 01:03:39,504
Huh?

1148
01:03:39,615 --> 01:03:41,549
I-i need to talk to you.

1149
01:03:41,651 --> 01:03:42,948
Okay.

1150
01:03:43,219 --> 01:03:44,686
In private.

1151
01:03:44,787 --> 01:03:48,188
I don't know what i was thinkin'. 20 guys?

1152
01:03:48,291 --> 01:03:49,952
Three's my limit.

1153
01:03:50,226 --> 01:03:52,421
You gotta have your limits. Right?

1154
01:03:52,528 --> 01:03:55,793
I mean, it's like drinking.
You know when you've had enough.

1155
01:03:55,898 --> 01:03:57,525
You have no choice.

1156
01:03:57,633 --> 01:04:00,466
I already paid the guys, paid the camera
crews,

1157
01:04:00,570 --> 01:04:02,834
paid all the advertising.

1158
01:04:02,939 --> 01:04:04,839
Crying is not an option here.

1159
01:04:04,941 --> 01:04:07,432
We need to be adults.

1160
01:04:07,543 --> 01:04:10,239
That's why they call it the adult film business,

1161
01:04:10,346 --> 01:04:13,474
and this is business, and
we've gotta be professionals.

1162
01:04:13,583 --> 01:04:15,847
This was your idea.

1163
01:04:15,952 --> 01:04:18,785
- Yeah, but...
- now, don't make me angry.

1164
01:04:18,888 --> 01:04:21,618
I don't like getting angry.

1165
01:04:21,724 --> 01:04:24,420
I scare myself when i get upset.

1166
01:04:25,962 --> 01:04:29,159
Look. I'll give you another nine grand,

1167
01:04:30,600 --> 01:04:34,195
and i'll co-sign for that new suv that you like.

1168
01:04:34,303 --> 01:04:35,930
The eskimo.

1169
01:04:37,840 --> 01:04:39,740
It's an escalade.

1170
01:04:39,842 --> 01:04:42,504
The escalade.

1171
01:04:42,612 --> 01:04:44,170
Okay?

1172
01:04:44,280 --> 01:04:46,874
We're on the same team. Remember?

1173
01:04:46,983 --> 01:04:49,315
Here. Look.

1174
01:04:51,721 --> 01:04:54,189
Sh.

1175
01:04:54,290 --> 01:04:58,351
I'll give you a little bump.
Get you back on track.

1176
01:04:58,461 --> 01:05:00,190
Okay? Come on.

1177
01:05:07,370 --> 01:05:08,894
Huh?

1178
01:05:17,513 --> 01:05:18,912
I still can't do it.

1179
01:05:19,181 --> 01:05:22,207
Now! Okay? You're not hearing me!

1180
01:05:26,522 --> 01:05:28,786
Moon, did you hear what i said?

1181
01:05:28,891 --> 01:05:30,290
What? Oh...

1182
01:05:30,393 --> 01:05:33,726
wouldn't it be nice
to have a boyfriend for once?

1183
01:05:33,829 --> 01:05:37,230
Look, kip, i don't know
if i believe in monogamy.

1184
01:05:37,333 --> 01:05:38,925
You know? I mean...

1185
01:05:39,201 --> 01:05:41,396
i just... i just think that maybe

1186
01:05:41,504 --> 01:05:44,371
humans were not meant to be monogamous.

1187
01:05:44,473 --> 01:05:47,567
I-i think that it's... it's not in our nature.

1188
01:05:47,677 --> 01:05:49,577
Men, i can see how they

1189
01:05:49,679 --> 01:05:51,613
could have the urge not to be monogamous.

1190
01:05:51,714 --> 01:05:53,375
Their whole function was designed

1191
01:05:53,482 --> 01:05:55,950
to hunt and plant their seed.

1192
01:05:57,653 --> 01:06:00,486
I mean, isn't that what
you're tryin' to do right now?

1193
01:06:00,589 --> 01:06:03,717
Hunt me down so you can seed me?

1194
01:06:03,826 --> 01:06:05,589
No.

1195
01:06:05,695 --> 01:06:09,893
But god forbid i have a sexual
thought about a porn star.

1196
01:06:21,944 --> 01:06:23,878
- Welcome to the house.
- Oh, thank you.

1197
01:06:24,146 --> 01:06:26,671
Did you say hello to our congregation yet?

1198
01:06:26,782 --> 01:06:28,511
Uh, no. Not with the verbals.

1199
01:06:28,617 --> 01:06:29,845
Well, don't be shy.

1200
01:06:29,952 --> 01:06:33,285
Trust me, girl. I am not the shy type.

1201
01:06:33,389 --> 01:06:36,688
I love the money.
The money's been good to me.

1202
01:06:36,792 --> 01:06:40,387
Now the sister is rollin' in beverly hills.

1203
01:06:56,879 --> 01:07:00,440
You know, i don't even
really know who i'm kidding.

1204
01:07:00,549 --> 01:07:03,484
I have a 20-second sex loop that
runs through my mind endlessly.

1205
01:07:03,586 --> 01:07:05,884
I think all men do. I know all men do.

1206
01:07:06,155 --> 01:07:10,091
But i don't think i would have sex with you now,
even if you were offering.

1207
01:07:10,192 --> 01:07:11,625
Or anyone else for that matter.

1208
01:07:11,727 --> 01:07:13,661
You wouldn't?

1209
01:07:14,930 --> 01:07:16,522
I mean, don't get me wrong.

1210
01:07:16,632 --> 01:07:20,090
There is nothing that i would
like more than to grab you

1211
01:07:20,202 --> 01:07:23,865
and spin you around and make
you scream like a banshee.

1212
01:07:24,140 --> 01:07:25,903
A banshee?

1213
01:07:26,175 --> 01:07:27,642
Whatever.

1214
01:07:27,743 --> 01:07:29,802
I think you get the point.

1215
01:07:29,912 --> 01:07:32,380
Yeah. I do get the point.

1216
01:07:33,849 --> 01:07:36,647
I'll wait for you.

1217
01:07:36,752 --> 01:07:38,652
I don't judge you at all for...

1218
01:07:38,754 --> 01:07:41,814
being a porn star,
or for having been a porn star.

1219
01:07:43,959 --> 01:07:45,483
These people that do judge you,

1220
01:07:45,594 --> 01:07:48,563
i think they're the same
people who run off and...

1221
01:07:48,664 --> 01:07:51,633
cheat on their so-called
committed relationships.

1222
01:07:53,469 --> 01:07:55,733
But you're honest.

1223
01:07:58,240 --> 01:08:00,606
And if i wanna have sex, then...

1224
01:08:00,709 --> 01:08:02,802
i'll just have sex with myself.

1225
01:08:02,912 --> 01:08:05,506
- You would do that for me?
- Yeah.

1226
01:08:05,614 --> 01:08:09,880
I've got enough personalities
to last me for a little while.

1227
01:08:21,163 --> 01:08:24,189
- I'm glad you made it up here.
- Mmm.

1228
01:08:33,242 --> 01:08:36,837
You know what? It doesn't do
very much for my ego though,

1229
01:08:36,946 --> 01:08:39,847
gettin' turned down by a porn star.

1230
01:08:39,949 --> 01:08:41,849
Wanna get that?

1231
01:08:41,951 --> 01:08:44,476
- Well, don't take it personally.
- Yeah. Please.

1232
01:08:45,621 --> 01:08:46,918
Thanks.

1233
01:08:47,189 --> 01:08:49,316
Hello?

1234
01:08:49,425 --> 01:08:52,622
Yeah. Can you tell me over the phone?

1235
01:08:52,728 --> 01:08:55,526
Yeah. Okay. I'll come in.

1236
01:09:08,878 --> 01:09:11,176
Kiska, where are you?

1237
01:09:18,154 --> 01:09:21,385
Dr. Bax, extension 456.

1238
01:09:21,490 --> 01:09:24,186
Dr. Bax, extension 456.

1239
01:09:27,363 --> 01:09:30,491
You are one of the most well-known porn stars

1240
01:09:30,599 --> 01:09:31,827
on video and the internet.

1241
01:09:31,934 --> 01:09:35,495
Certainly in the u.s.,
and now more around the world.

1242
01:09:35,604 --> 01:09:38,835
Some view you as the first true internet star.

1243
01:09:38,941 --> 01:09:41,603
But honestly, do you like what you do?

1244
01:09:44,280 --> 01:09:46,748
Cheyenne?

1245
01:09:46,849 --> 01:09:50,182
Cheyenne? Moon? I'm ready for you.

1246
01:09:50,286 --> 01:09:53,312
Can we go in together?

1247
01:09:53,422 --> 01:09:55,913
I think that'd be a good idea.

1248
01:10:07,603 --> 01:10:10,936
You guys can go ahead and, uh, take a seat.

1249
01:10:19,281 --> 01:10:21,841
You guys are both so young.

1250
01:10:21,951 --> 01:10:24,579
I hate to go through this whole thing with you.

1251
01:10:27,189 --> 01:10:29,157
Take a deep breath.

1252
01:10:31,393 --> 01:10:33,657
You're both negative.

1253
01:10:34,830 --> 01:10:35,888
I love you, moon.

1254
01:10:35,998 --> 01:10:38,159
Oh, i love you too.

1255
01:10:38,267 --> 01:10:42,897
I hope you guys are gonna be more careful so
we don't have to go through this again. Okay?

1256
01:10:43,005 --> 01:10:45,439
- Yeah.
- Condoms every time.

1257
01:10:45,541 --> 01:10:47,202
- Yes.
- One on every finger.

1258
01:10:47,309 --> 01:10:51,177
- Oh, my god.
- Be careful. Take care of yourself. Okay?

1259
01:12:43,992 --> 01:12:45,721
Just do me a favor.

1260
01:12:45,828 --> 01:12:47,853
If you say you're gonna do something, do it.

1261
01:12:47,963 --> 01:12:49,897
If you can't get the tires, call me.

1262
01:12:49,998 --> 01:12:51,465
Either way, it doesn't matter.

1263
01:12:51,567 --> 01:12:53,535
Let me know what the hell's going on.

1264
01:12:53,635 --> 01:12:54,693
Okay.

1265
01:12:56,238 --> 01:13:00,265
Okay. Thank you. I'll speak
to you later. All right. Good.

1266
01:13:00,376 --> 01:13:01,843
- Hi.
- How you doin'?

1267
01:13:01,944 --> 01:13:03,571
- You all right?
- I'm fine.

1268
01:13:03,679 --> 01:13:05,738
You got some nice cars out there.

1269
01:13:05,848 --> 01:13:06,906
Thank you.

1270
01:13:07,182 --> 01:13:09,878
This is gonna sound like a pickup.
Do i know you?

1271
01:13:10,152 --> 01:13:11,847
No. I don't think so.

1272
01:13:11,954 --> 01:13:13,854
Are you sure?

1273
01:13:13,956 --> 01:13:15,184
Yeah.

1274
01:13:15,290 --> 01:13:17,190
I feel like i know you.

1275
01:13:17,292 --> 01:13:20,659
No. I don't think so. I never forget a face.

1276
01:13:20,763 --> 01:13:24,130
Um, can i ask you?
I wanted to know about the buick.

1277
01:13:24,233 --> 01:13:26,463
It's a great car. It's a '63 riv.

1278
01:13:26,568 --> 01:13:27,694
Does it have any rust?

1279
01:13:27,803 --> 01:13:29,828
- It's dry as a bone.
- Where's it from?

1280
01:13:29,938 --> 01:13:32,839
It's a cali car. It's always lived here.

1281
01:13:32,941 --> 01:13:35,341
Nice. What about the engine?

1282
01:13:35,444 --> 01:13:36,809
It's a 401 nailhead.

1283
01:13:36,912 --> 01:13:38,277
- It's a nailhead?
- That's right.

1284
01:13:38,380 --> 01:13:40,245
- Okay.
- You know your shit?

1285
01:13:40,349 --> 01:13:42,544
I used to work on cars with my dad.

1286
01:13:42,651 --> 01:13:43,948
Yeah. It's a good car.

1287
01:13:44,219 --> 01:13:45,914
How much do you want?

1288
01:13:46,188 --> 01:13:48,418
We're asking ten nine, but i mean,

1289
01:13:48,524 --> 01:13:50,856
we could always negotiate a little bit today.

1290
01:13:50,959 --> 01:13:52,756
What's the best you could do? For me?

1291
01:13:52,861 --> 01:13:55,887
I could take off... a thousand, 1,500.

1292
01:13:55,998 --> 01:13:58,398
Look. I'll be honest with you. Okay?

1293
01:13:58,500 --> 01:14:00,832
Um, i have five.

1294
01:14:00,936 --> 01:14:04,099
Thousand? You have $5,000?

1295
01:14:06,675 --> 01:14:09,576
You know, there's a bicycle
shop down the street.

1296
01:14:09,678 --> 01:14:11,111
Listen.

1297
01:14:11,213 --> 01:14:14,546
- What if i give you five gs,
- yeah.

1298
01:14:14,650 --> 01:14:17,710
And... and i'll make up the difference.

1299
01:14:18,954 --> 01:14:20,854
What do you mean? I'm-i'm-i'm...

1300
01:14:20,956 --> 01:14:23,925
i can't sell you that car for $5,000.

1301
01:14:27,496 --> 01:14:29,521
You know that.

1302
01:14:29,631 --> 01:14:32,498
So what do you want? What do you mean?

1303
01:14:32,601 --> 01:14:35,866
What're you trying to do to me?
I'm trying to run a business.

1304
01:14:35,971 --> 01:14:40,635
You and me can work something out...
between the two of us.

1305
01:14:40,742 --> 01:14:42,369
What do you say?

1306
01:14:46,348 --> 01:14:49,511
No one else needs to know about it.

1307
01:14:56,425 --> 01:14:58,393
Can i get some water?

1308
01:15:02,831 --> 01:15:06,494
Yeah. You can have a drink of water.

1309
01:15:24,486 --> 01:15:26,454
Let me see your tongue.

1310
01:15:39,968 --> 01:15:42,869
What turns you on? Huh?

1311
01:15:42,971 --> 01:15:45,235
- Humor.

1312
01:15:45,340 --> 01:15:47,604
- Humor.
- Humor?

1313
01:15:47,709 --> 01:15:49,768
You like jokes?

1314
01:15:49,878 --> 01:15:51,869
- Uh-huh.
- Here's a good joke.

1315
01:15:51,980 --> 01:15:53,572
What's the difference...

1316
01:15:53,682 --> 01:15:56,810
between a slut... and a bitch?

1317
01:15:56,919 --> 01:15:58,284
What?

1318
01:15:58,387 --> 01:16:00,548
A slut'll sleep with anyone,

1319
01:16:00,656 --> 01:16:02,487
- and a bitch...
- yeah?

1320
01:16:02,591 --> 01:16:05,253
Will sleep with anyone but you.

1321
01:16:05,360 --> 01:16:06,850
You can use that.

1322
01:16:07,129 --> 01:16:08,687
You like that?

1323
01:16:08,797 --> 01:16:10,822
You must know a lot of bitches.

1324
01:16:10,933 --> 01:16:13,094
I do know a lot of bitches.

1325
01:16:13,201 --> 01:16:15,362
But you're a little slut. Right?

1326
01:16:27,649 --> 01:16:30,914
Is that what you want? Huh?

1327
01:16:31,186 --> 01:16:33,814
Is that what you want?

1328
01:16:33,922 --> 01:16:35,856
You like that?

1329
01:16:35,958 --> 01:16:37,858
You like that?

1330
01:16:37,960 --> 01:16:39,689
Wait. Oh, my...

Yeah. I just drank a lot of water. You know?

1348
01:17:54,403 --> 01:17:56,769
Can i watch you?

1349
01:17:56,872 --> 01:17:58,669
Huh?

1350
01:17:59,975 --> 01:18:02,136
Do me a favor. Don't, um...

1352
01:18:05,881 --> 01:18:08,247

Hey. You okay in there?

1354
01:18:10,352 --> 01:18:12,183

No. Look...

1381
01:19:49,951 --> 01:19:51,851

1382
01:19:51,953 --> 01:19:55,354
Why are you leaving out of my fucking

1383
01:20:00,796 --> 01:20:02,923

To see if you'd stay faithful.

1391
01:20:34,996 --> 01:20:36,588
Okay?

1392
01:20:36,698 --> 01:20:38,393
I'm sorry.

1393
01:20:40,001 --> 01:20:42,231
My wife told you to do this?

1394
01:20:46,675 --> 01:20:48,905
My wife paid you to do this?

1395
01:20:52,480 --> 01:20:54,880
Did my wife tell you that...

1396
01:20:54,983 --> 01:20:57,349
that i have a family?

1397
01:20:59,020 --> 01:21:01,887
Did she tell you that we have a son?

1398
01:21:04,159 --> 01:21:06,423
He's beautiful. Right?

1399
01:21:06,528 --> 01:21:09,156
He looks just like my wife. Right?

1400
01:21:12,667 --> 01:21:14,828
I'll give you more money than her.

1401
01:21:14,936 --> 01:21:18,895
Because if you tell my wife,
she's gonna take my son away.

1402
01:21:19,174 --> 01:21:21,142
Are you gonna go tell my wife?

1403
01:21:21,243 --> 01:21:22,642
I don't know. Okay?

1404
01:21:22,744 --> 01:21:24,905
I don't know. I'm gonna think about it.

1405
01:21:25,180 --> 01:21:26,545
- Fuckin' cunt!
- I gotta go.

1406
01:21:26,648 --> 01:21:29,173
You think that you're gonna
ruin my fuckin' family?

1407
01:21:29,284 --> 01:21:30,717
Huh?

1408
01:21:30,819 --> 01:21:32,878
Is that what you're gonna do?

1409
01:21:32,988 --> 01:21:34,649
Where you from?

1410
01:21:34,756 --> 01:21:37,884
You think that i won't find out where you are?

1411
01:21:37,993 --> 01:21:40,223
Ruin my fuckin' life, you little fuckin' cunt?

1412
01:21:40,328 --> 01:21:42,296
No no no...

1413
01:21:42,397 --> 01:21:43,694
fuckin' bitch!

1414
01:21:43,798 --> 01:21:45,891
Let go!

1415
01:21:46,001 --> 01:21:47,901
Huh?

1416
01:21:51,206 --> 01:21:52,969
Ho!

1417
01:21:59,948 --> 01:22:00,846
You fucking cunt!

1418
01:22:05,453 --> 01:22:06,818
You dumb cunt.

1419
01:22:06,922 --> 01:22:08,219
Open the door.

1420
01:22:08,323 --> 01:22:10,484
Open the door!

1421
01:22:10,592 --> 01:22:11,752
Fuck.

1422
01:22:11,860 --> 01:22:14,454
- Ah!
- Open the fucking door you sneaky bitch!

1423
01:22:14,562 --> 01:22:15,859
You wanna fuck around?

1424
01:22:15,964 --> 01:22:18,159
You stay away from me, bitch!

1425
01:22:18,266 --> 01:22:19,460
You understand me?

1426
01:22:20,702 --> 01:22:22,863
You stay away from my family!

1427
01:22:22,971 --> 01:22:24,939
You sneaky bitch!

1428
01:22:25,206 --> 01:22:27,231
Cunt.

1429
01:22:27,342 --> 01:22:29,333
I'll break your fuckin' head!

1430
01:22:29,444 --> 01:22:31,309
You wanna fuck around?

1431
01:22:31,413 --> 01:22:33,779
Huh? Open this fuckin' door!

1432
01:22:35,984 --> 01:22:38,885
You wanna ruin my fuckin' family?

1433
01:22:38,987 --> 01:22:41,820
You stay away from my family!

1434
01:22:41,923 --> 01:22:43,720
Bitch!

1435
01:23:19,461 --> 01:23:20,928
Kip?

1436
01:23:27,736 --> 01:23:29,431
Kip?

1437
01:23:31,506 --> 01:23:33,497
Kip?

1438
01:23:33,608 --> 01:23:37,772
Shit. Please be home,
please be home, please be home...

1439
01:23:37,879 --> 01:23:39,642
kip?

1440
01:23:39,748 --> 01:23:40,942
Fuck.

1441
01:23:41,216 --> 01:23:43,480
Hmm.

1442
01:23:44,686 --> 01:23:46,711
Oh, my god.

1443
01:23:50,492 --> 01:23:52,892
You okay? Is everything okay?

1444
01:23:52,994 --> 01:23:55,519
I don't know what i'm doing anymore.

1445
01:23:55,630 --> 01:23:57,222
I don't...

1446
01:23:57,332 --> 01:24:00,165
- i don't know if i'm hurting people.
- It's okay.

1447
01:24:00,268 --> 01:24:01,826
Slow down.

1448
01:24:01,936 --> 01:24:04,200
Tell me what's goin' on.

1449
01:24:04,305 --> 01:24:07,172
I don't know what i'm doing to peoples' lives.

1450
01:24:19,320 --> 01:24:21,220
Wait.

1451
01:24:21,322 --> 01:24:23,290
- I, uh...
- moon...

1452
01:24:23,391 --> 01:24:26,622
you're not doing anything
to anyone's life. Okay?

1453
01:24:26,728 --> 01:24:29,288
M-maybe this is what you need.

1454
01:24:29,397 --> 01:24:32,298
For the first time in your
life you're starting to feel.

1455
01:24:32,400 --> 01:24:34,334
You're starting to let someone in.

1456
01:24:39,974 --> 01:24:42,374
It's all right.

1457
01:24:42,477 --> 01:24:44,240
I'm sorry.

1458
01:24:44,345 --> 01:24:46,210
I, uh...

1459
01:24:47,449 --> 01:24:50,680
sh. Don't say anything, moon. It's okay.

1460
01:24:50,785 --> 01:24:53,777
You should... you're letting me in.

1461
01:24:53,888 --> 01:24:56,880
I-i can see that now. Y-you've got all these...

1462
01:24:56,991 --> 01:24:59,892
fucking walls up, and you're
so impenetrable, and...

1463
01:24:59,994 --> 01:25:02,394
and it's scary.

1464
01:25:04,265 --> 01:25:06,096
Look. I just...

1465
01:25:06,201 --> 01:25:07,828
i don't, i don't...

1466
01:25:07,936 --> 01:25:10,097
moon, moon, please don't go.

1467
01:25:10,205 --> 01:25:12,571
Why don't you stay here?

1468
01:25:12,674 --> 01:25:15,837
No. You know what? I'm gonna
come back. Uh, i'm gonna...

1469
01:25:15,944 --> 01:25:18,504
- what do you have to think about?
- I have to...

1470
01:25:18,613 --> 01:25:20,843
could this be any more real?

1471
01:25:20,949 --> 01:25:22,917
Right here.

1472
01:25:26,754 --> 01:25:28,915
You're gonna run away from this?

1473
01:25:32,961 --> 01:25:34,929
Uh, i gotta go.

1474
01:25:44,372 --> 01:25:45,862
I don't know what i'm doing.

1475
01:25:45,974 --> 01:25:49,341
I don't know what i'm doing
with my life. I don't know.

1476
01:25:49,444 --> 01:25:51,912
I'm not goin' anywhere. I'm here.

1477
01:26:26,681 --> 01:26:28,581
Pops?

1478
01:26:30,351 --> 01:26:31,875
Pops?

1479
01:26:35,957 --> 01:26:37,925
Pops?

1480
01:26:39,561 --> 01:26:41,256
Pops.

1481
01:26:44,299 --> 01:26:45,698
Pops?

1482
01:26:47,602 --> 01:26:50,935
Pops? Po... pops?

1483
01:26:58,846 --> 01:27:00,541
Shit, pops.

1484
01:27:05,553 --> 01:27:07,817
Hey you guys?

1485
01:27:07,922 --> 01:27:11,881
- Have you seen an old man walking around?
- No.

1486
01:27:18,333 --> 01:27:21,564
Look, officer. He likes to get
dressed-up when we go out.

1487
01:27:21,669 --> 01:27:24,695
Maybe he was wearing
his blue suit. I don't know.

1488
01:27:24,806 --> 01:27:26,774
Yes.

1489
01:27:26,874 --> 01:27:29,468
Okay. Yes. I understand.

1490
01:27:29,577 --> 01:27:31,477
Yes. Thank you.

1491
01:27:45,493 --> 01:27:47,893
Police. Open up.

1492
01:27:49,197 --> 01:27:50,494
- What?
- Pops.

1493
01:27:50,598 --> 01:27:51,656
Is this your father?

1494
01:27:51,766 --> 01:27:53,563
- Yes. It's my dad.
- Please step back.

1495
01:27:53,668 --> 01:27:55,863
- Um um um...
- sir, just stand right here.

1496
01:27:55,970 --> 01:27:57,369
- Officer...
- ma'am,

1497
01:27:57,472 --> 01:27:58,939
stand back and listen.

1498
01:27:59,207 --> 01:28:00,868
- Sir, please.
- What?

1499
01:28:01,142 --> 01:28:03,133
Somebody called, thought he was a pervert.

1500
01:28:03,244 --> 01:28:04,609
No.

1501
01:28:04,712 --> 01:28:07,738
He was goin' up to people sayin' "kiss her."

1502
01:28:07,849 --> 01:28:09,817
- Kiska.
- He was...

1503
01:28:09,917 --> 01:28:11,509
he couldn't remember where he lived,

1504
01:28:11,619 --> 01:28:13,246
- officer, listen.
- Couldn't remember his name.

1505
01:28:13,354 --> 01:28:14,787
I live here. I'm goin' in.

1506
01:28:14,889 --> 01:28:17,187
He was saying kiska.
It's what he called my mom.

1507
01:28:17,292 --> 01:28:18,816
It means "kitten" in russian.

1508
01:28:18,926 --> 01:28:20,826
He had a breakdown after my mother died.

1509
01:28:20,928 --> 01:28:23,226
I understand. If you're gonna take care of him,

1510
01:28:23,331 --> 01:28:25,231
take care of him, before
something serious happens.

1511
01:28:25,333 --> 01:28:27,824
- I'm not sure i like your tone of voice.
- Absolutely.

1512
01:28:27,935 --> 01:28:29,459
I could kick your ass.

1513
01:28:29,570 --> 01:28:31,333
- Here are his clothes.
- Thank you.

1514
01:28:31,439 --> 01:28:34,306
- Take him inside.
- He probably hasn't eaten yet. Thank you.

1515
01:28:36,678 --> 01:28:38,805
Do you know how worried i was?

1516
01:28:38,913 --> 01:28:41,848
- Give me a hug. Come here.
- I'm gonna go to bed now.

1517
01:28:41,949 --> 01:28:44,816
A man can't walk around without
gettin' arrested anymore.

1518
01:28:44,919 --> 01:28:47,717
I'm goin' to bed. Good night.

1519
01:28:53,261 --> 01:28:54,853
Hello?

1520
01:28:54,962 --> 01:28:55,929
Hi, moon.

1521
01:28:56,197 --> 01:28:57,926
Hi, mr. Aronson.

1522
01:28:59,701 --> 01:29:01,794
Getting a little concerned around here.

1523
01:29:01,903 --> 01:29:03,632
Haven't seen you in a while.

1524
01:29:03,738 --> 01:29:05,729
Have you, uh...

1525
01:29:05,840 --> 01:29:07,432
signed that contract yet?

1526
01:29:07,542 --> 01:29:09,476
No, not yet. No. I've, um...

1527
01:29:09,577 --> 01:29:10,805
is it the money?

1528
01:29:10,912 --> 01:29:12,812
If that's a problem, i mean,

1529
01:29:12,914 --> 01:29:14,313
just let me know.

1530
01:29:14,415 --> 01:29:16,110
No. Nothing's wrong. I've just, uh...

1531
01:29:16,217 --> 01:29:19,084
why don't you come in?
We can talk about it. Huh?

1532
01:29:19,187 --> 01:29:21,655
Got wonderful ideas for you.

1533
01:29:23,324 --> 01:29:25,622
Yeah, sure. I'll come in.

1534
01:29:25,727 --> 01:29:27,388
Yeah. I promise.

1535
01:29:27,495 --> 01:29:28,621
Okay.

1536
01:29:28,730 --> 01:29:30,857
Love you, moon. Bye, now.

1537
01:30:17,645 --> 01:30:19,613
Turn around, girls.

1538
01:30:22,950 --> 01:30:25,282
How old are you?

1539
01:30:25,386 --> 01:30:27,479
Eighteen.

1540
01:30:27,588 --> 01:30:29,453
Let me see your i.d.

1541
01:30:37,532 --> 01:30:40,365
Where'd you get this made? Kinko's?

1542
01:30:40,468 --> 01:30:42,902
How old are you really?

1543
01:30:43,004 --> 01:30:44,972
Sixteen.

1544
01:30:47,875 --> 01:30:50,969
I can't have you doing
intercourse. That's illegal.

1545
01:30:52,313 --> 01:30:55,771
I mean, believe it or not, uh, i have principles.

1546
01:30:57,018 --> 01:30:59,350
I might be able to... you know,

1547
01:30:59,454 --> 01:31:02,855
put you in the web house,
and you could play with yourself

1548
01:31:02,957 --> 01:31:04,925
occasionally and... give oral.

1549
01:31:05,193 --> 01:31:07,661
Do you like giving head?

1550
01:31:09,931 --> 01:31:11,922
Why do you wanna do this?

1551
01:31:16,537 --> 01:31:19,301
She... she wants to be
on the internet. You know?

1552
01:31:19,407 --> 01:31:21,898
Um... be famous.

1553
01:31:22,176 --> 01:31:23,700
Yeah.

1554
01:31:23,811 --> 01:31:25,403
- Like in the real world.
- Uh-huh.

1555
01:31:25,513 --> 01:31:27,140
- Like in the real world.
Yeah.

1556
01:31:27,248 --> 01:31:29,148
Will i get paid?

1557
01:31:31,986 --> 01:31:33,510

Can i talk to you?

1561
01:31:39,393 --> 01:31:41,725
Today, everybody wants to talk.

1562
01:31:41,829 --> 01:31:44,957
Ladies, would you wait outside for a minute?

1563
01:31:46,834 --> 01:31:48,665
So?

1564
01:31:48,769 --> 01:31:51,431
Have you come to sign the contract?

1565
01:31:55,009 --> 01:31:57,569
You know i want the best for you.

1566
01:31:57,678 --> 01:32:00,442
And we know there's only one moon.

01:32:01,949 --> 01:32:05,908
remember... five years ago?

1569
01:32:08,422 --> 01:32:11,550
You were sitting there just like those girls.

1570
01:32:15,696 --> 01:32:17,664
Go ahead. Smoke.

1571
01:32:20,468 --> 01:32:22,436
And look at you now.

1572
01:32:23,571 --> 01:32:25,539
You're a superstar.

1573
01:32:26,908 --> 01:32:30,275
With us behind you...

1574
01:32:30,378 --> 01:32:33,609
your star's only gonna get better and bigger.

1575
01:32:33,714 --> 01:32:36,774
I mean, you'll become a galaxy.

1576
01:32:36,884 --> 01:32:40,376
That's not what i want. I want to be on my own.

1577
01:32:40,488 --> 01:32:42,718
Your... your own?

1578
01:32:42,823 --> 01:32:44,723
But you're...

1579
01:32:44,825 --> 01:32:48,226
you're part of a family here.
I mean, you need to...

1580
01:32:48,329 --> 01:32:50,297
i don't need.

1581
01:32:51,766 --> 01:32:53,597
It's my body.

1582
01:32:53,701 --> 01:32:55,669
Oh, moon.

1583
01:32:58,005 --> 01:33:00,337
You're like a daughter to me.

1584
01:33:00,441 --> 01:33:03,706
You... came in here a little girl.

1585
01:33:04,912 --> 01:33:06,812
Now you're a woman.

1586
01:33:06,914 --> 01:33:08,575
That's just it.

1587
01:33:08,683 --> 01:33:10,583
I'm a woman now.

1588
01:33:18,593 --> 01:33:20,288
Moon...

1589
01:33:22,964 --> 01:33:24,932
you take care of yourself.

1590
01:33:40,615 --> 01:33:43,778
Moon, i got a dream.

1591
01:33:43,884 --> 01:33:45,374
The... the internet.

1592
01:33:45,486 --> 01:33:47,477
It's private and raw.

1593
01:33:47,588 --> 01:33:50,648
I'm gonna create internet sex houses

1594
01:33:50,758 --> 01:33:53,921

1595
01:33:54,195 --> 01:33:58,757
having sex, taking showers,
on the toilet, everything.

1596
01:33:58,866 --> 01:34:01,426
Bring out the voyeur in all of us.

1597
01:34:01,535 --> 01:34:03,093
Web cameras everywhere.

1598
01:34:03,204 --> 01:34:05,104
And you, moon,

1599
01:34:05,206 --> 01:34:07,197

- I couldn't lie to her.
- You couldn't lie?

1611
01:35:24,952 --> 01:35:26,852
You couldn't... you couldn't lie?

01:35:26,954 --> 01:35:28,444
You couldn't lie?

I'm not looking for any more answers.

1653
01:38:35,943 --> 01:38:38,810
I'm not looking for any more truth.

1654
01:38:38,913 --> 01:38:42,542
The truth is, i don't know what i'm looking for.

1655
01:38:44,952 --> 01:38:46,852
But you know what?

1656
01:38:46,954 --> 01:38:49,616
I'm not gonna wait until i die

1657
01:38:49,723 --> 01:38:52,351
to find out if there's reincarnation.

1658
01:38:53,661 --> 01:38:57,859
We can reincarnate while we live. Right?

1659
01:39:28,796 --> 01:39:30,764
Hey. Jump in.
