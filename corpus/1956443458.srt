1
00:00:31,641 --> 00:00:35,286
Do you, Ethan, take Julia to
be your lawful wedded wife?

2
00:00:35,851 --> 00:00:41,345
I do. - To have, to hold,
to love, cherish, honor and protect?

3
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:42,805
I do.

4
00:00:43,174 --> 00:00:50,140
Shield from terrors know
and unknown? To lie, to deceive.

5
00:00:50,540 --> 00:00:56,057
To lead a double life. To fail to
prevent her abduction. Erase her identity.

6
00:00:56,186 --> 00:01:00,495
Force her into hiding. Take
away all she has known. - Stop.

7
00:01:00,496 --> 00:01:03,551
In a selfish, futile,
fleeting attempt... - Stop!

8
00:01:03,552 --> 00:01:07,567
...to escape your own true self.
- Please, stop.

9
00:01:07,568 --> 00:01:11,075
And Julia do you
choose to accept... - Don’t!

10
00:01:11,165 --> 00:01:12,470
I do.

11
00:01:12,868 --> 00:01:14,173
No!

12
00:01:15,305 --> 00:01:17,055
You should have killed me.

13
00:01:25,204 --> 00:01:27,607
<i>BELFAST</i>

14
00:01:45,706 --> 00:01:47,760
Fate whispers to the warrior.

15
00:01:48,691 --> 00:01:50,188
The storm is coming.

16
00:01:50,884 --> 00:01:52,856
And the warrior whispers back?

17
00:01:55,059 --> 00:01:56,820
I am the storm.

18
00:02:27,791 --> 00:02:29,708
<i>IDENTITY CONFIRMED
HUNT, ETHAN</i>

19
00:02:31,254 --> 00:02:35,291
Good evening, Mr. Hunt.
The anarchist Solomon Lane.

20
00:02:36,384 --> 00:02:38,885
Since you captured him,
two years ago, his absence

21
00:02:38,909 --> 00:02:41,797
from the world stage has had
unintended consequences.

22
00:02:42,259 --> 00:02:46,757
His syndicate of rogue covert operatives
continues to wreak havoc around the globe.

23
00:02:46,852 --> 00:02:49,347
The <i>CIA</i> special activities
division has relentlessly

24
00:02:49,371 --> 00:02:51,481
hunted Lanes elite
network of hostiles.

25
00:02:52,039 --> 00:02:54,158
But many remain
unknown and at large.

26
00:02:54,675 --> 00:02:59,285
The reminiscence of this extremist splinter
cell refer to them self as <i>The Apostles</i>.

27
00:03:00,655 --> 00:03:02,856
They have sync it up to the
policy of terror for hire.

28
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:05,127
Making them an
even greater threat.

29
00:03:05,611 --> 00:03:08,719
They are responsible for the
recent smallpox outbreak in Indian

30
00:03:08,743 --> 00:03:11,824
controlled Kashmir. Along the
borders of Children and Pakistan.

31
00:03:11,848 --> 00:03:14,403
Threatening one third of
the worlds population.

32
00:03:14,667 --> 00:03:18,263
The Epidemic is being contained
but intelligence would indicate that

33
00:03:18,287 --> 00:03:21,952
a new client has hired the Apostles
for a more ambitious operation.

34
00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:25,258
They have been contacted by
this man. An unidentified extremist

35
00:03:25,282 --> 00:03:27,759
known only by the
codename John Lark.

36
00:03:28,116 --> 00:03:30,305
Author of this apocalyptic
manifesto calling for

37
00:03:30,329 --> 00:03:32,268
the destruction of the
current world order.

38
00:03:32,292 --> 00:03:34,430
<i>THERE HAS NEVER BEEN PEACE
WITHOUT FIRST A GREAT SUFFERING.</i>

39
00:03:34,454 --> 00:03:37,117
It is believed Lark is responsible
for the disappearance of Norwegian

40
00:03:37,141 --> 00:03:39,870
nuclear weapons
specialist, Nils Debruuk.

41
00:03:39,894 --> 00:03:42,395
Dr. Debruuk security
clearance was revoked after

42
00:03:42,419 --> 00:03:44,752
he expressed fiercely
anti-religious views.

43
00:03:45,128 --> 00:03:47,352
Meanwhile, the Apostles
have been in contact

44
00:03:47,376 --> 00:03:49,774
with elements of the
eastern European underworld

45
00:03:49,798 --> 00:03:51,875
who are in possession
of 3 plutonium cores

46
00:03:51,899 --> 00:03:54,343
stolen from a missile
base in eastern Russia.

47
00:03:55,318 --> 00:03:58,068
This would indicate that John
Lark and the Apostles are

48
00:03:58,092 --> 00:04:01,146
working together to acquire
functioning nuclear weapons.

49
00:04:01,924 --> 00:04:05,660
<i>NAST</i> estimates that a man with
Debruuks knowledge, using the materials in play,

50
00:04:05,684 --> 00:04:09,261
could complete 3 nuclear weapons
in as little as 72 hours.

51
00:04:10,255 --> 00:04:14,587
These devices would be man portable and
deployable anywhere on Earth overnight.

52
00:04:15,284 --> 00:04:18,086
In the hands of John Lark and
the Apostles these weapons

53
00:04:18,110 --> 00:04:21,386
represent an unprecedented
threat to the countless millions.

54
00:04:22,041 --> 00:04:25,193
Your mission, should you choose
to accept it, is to prevent the

55
00:04:25,217 --> 00:04:29,104
Apostles from acquiring the plutonium
using any means at your disposal.

56
00:04:29,745 --> 00:04:33,120
If you, or any members of your
<i>IMF</i> team, are caught or killed,

57
00:04:33,144 --> 00:04:36,254
the Secretary will disavow
any knowledge of your actions.

58
00:04:36,473 --> 00:04:39,984
Good luck, Ethan. This message
will self-destruct in 5 seconds.

59
00:04:52,517 --> 00:04:55,164
<i>BERLIN</i>

60
00:04:55,807 --> 00:04:56,807
He's late.

61
00:04:57,275 --> 00:04:58,275
He's never late.

62
00:04:58,985 --> 00:04:59,985
He'll be here.

63
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:01,319
I don’t like it.

64
00:05:02,050 --> 00:05:04,250
There's something
about this guy. He just...

65
00:05:04,274 --> 00:05:06,662
really gives me the creeps.
- It's Ok. Relax.

66
00:05:07,370 --> 00:05:08,370
I'm relaxed.

67
00:05:08,980 --> 00:05:12,189
You don’t sound relaxed. Luther,
does he sound relaxed to you?

68
00:05:12,213 --> 00:05:16,403
He sounds terrified. - I'm not terrified.
I just have a bad feeling. That's all.

69
00:05:16,427 --> 00:05:19,273
I though you said you were relaxed?
- It's entirely possible

70
00:05:19,297 --> 00:05:21,786
to be relaxed any extremely
uneasy at the same time.

71
00:05:21,810 --> 00:05:24,413
No, it's not.
- You do it all the time. - No, I don’t.

72
00:05:24,437 --> 00:05:28,197
Yes, you do. - No, he doesn't. - I'm supposed
to believe you're perfectly relaxed?

73
00:05:28,221 --> 00:05:30,571
Right here and now? In
a dark alleyway? Waiting

74
00:05:30,595 --> 00:05:33,214
to buy dark market plutonium
from a psychopath? - Benji,

75
00:05:33,238 --> 00:05:35,499
I wont let anything
happen to you.

76
00:05:35,901 --> 00:05:37,448
<i>See, Benji, you're
perfectly safe.</i>

77
00:05:37,472 --> 00:05:39,611
That's easy for your to say.
You're in the van.

78
00:05:39,635 --> 00:05:41,634
Well, you want to be
in the field, tough guy.

79
00:05:41,658 --> 00:05:43,808
<i>And tonight</i>, Luther, I'd
like to be in the van!

80
00:05:43,832 --> 00:05:44,831
He's here.

81
00:05:45,610 --> 00:05:46,610
Oh, God.

82
00:06:02,284 --> 00:06:04,925
<i>Have that money
ready, Luther.</i> - Done.

83
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:12,194
Ethan, do you copy?
Do you copy?!

84
00:06:25,531 --> 00:06:27,586
Are we finally
gonna do this, or not?

85
00:06:33,706 --> 00:06:37,676
I've survived in this business
with a help of a voice in my head.

86
00:06:39,723 --> 00:06:43,372
This voice is never wrong.
Whenever I meet you...

87
00:06:43,748 --> 00:06:45,484
It tells me the same thing.

88
00:06:46,207 --> 00:06:47,206
What's that?

89
00:06:48,274 --> 00:06:49,273
Nothing.

90
00:06:54,616 --> 00:06:57,727
I'm here to do business.
Tell the voice to flip the coin.

91
00:07:29,939 --> 00:07:30,938
What's that?

92
00:07:31,099 --> 00:07:33,328
This is a beryllium rod.
It's just causing a

93
00:07:33,352 --> 00:07:35,740
reaction with the plutonium
inside the core.

94
00:07:45,027 --> 00:07:46,027
That's that.

95
00:07:49,401 --> 00:07:50,401
The money?

96
00:07:51,850 --> 00:07:52,849
The money.

97
00:07:55,932 --> 00:07:56,931
Bring the money.

98
00:08:09,578 --> 00:08:10,968
Luther, bring the money.

99
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:22,144
We're gonna need
that money, Luther.

100
00:08:22,616 --> 00:08:23,616
Kill them!

101
00:08:29,374 --> 00:08:30,373
I've got it!

102
00:08:35,211 --> 00:08:36,766
Luther, do you copy?
Luther?!

103
00:08:37,344 --> 00:08:38,343
Luther, come in.

104
00:08:38,697 --> 00:08:42,332
<i>Luther is not here right now.
What can the Apostles do for you...</i>

105
00:08:43,106 --> 00:08:45,138
<i>...Hunt?</i>
- What do you want?

106
00:08:45,557 --> 00:08:48,227
<i>You're not escaping, Hunt.
Give us the plutonium.</i>

107
00:08:48,679 --> 00:08:51,126
<i>And walk away.</i>
- Benji, get the car!

108
00:08:51,961 --> 00:08:55,074
I don’t think I can do that.
- Benji, get the car.

109
00:09:15,740 --> 00:09:17,541
We'll make your a deal, Hunt.

110
00:09:17,975 --> 00:09:20,966
Give us the plutonium
and we won't kill your friend.

111
00:09:24,777 --> 00:09:26,832
Don't you do it, Ethan!
Not for me!

112
00:09:40,532 --> 00:09:41,699
I'm gonna count to 3.

113
00:09:42,761 --> 00:09:43,761
One...

114
00:09:48,477 --> 00:09:48,781
Two...
- Luther, I'm sorry.

115
00:09:48,782 --> 00:09:49,782
Three!

116
00:10:05,029 --> 00:10:07,202
I'm sorry. I didn't know
what else to do. - We're good.

117
00:10:11,813 --> 00:10:13,573
You're Ok?
- I should be dead.

118
00:10:14,262 --> 00:10:15,747
We should all be dead!

119
00:10:17,462 --> 00:10:18,461
Why aren't we?

120
00:10:19,864 --> 00:10:21,086
Where's the plutonium?

121
00:10:33,488 --> 00:10:34,487
It's gone.

122
00:10:39,305 --> 00:10:43,439
<i>If you're just joining us, three
massive explosions have gone off</i>

123
00:10:43,464 --> 00:10:47,707
<i>simultaneously in what appears
to be a coordinated attack.</i>

124
00:10:47,708 --> 00:10:50,245
<i>This image is live in Rome.
Looking towards the Vatican.</i>

125
00:10:50,269 --> 00:10:52,911
<i>It's as close
as our cameras can get.</i>

126
00:10:53,389 --> 00:10:57,644
<i>It's believed that the Pope was in
residence at the time of the blast.</i>

127
00:10:57,645 --> 00:11:01,723
<i>Also live, we're looking at the
Jerusalem from just outside of the city.</i>

128
00:11:02,103 --> 00:11:06,067
<i>Also live, the holly city of Mecca.
From the USS Ronald Reagan</i>

129
00:11:06,172 --> 00:11:08,699
<i>in the Red Sea, off
the coast of Saudi Arabia.</i>

130
00:11:09,251 --> 00:11:12,589
<i>Radiation has been detected.
Indicating that nuclear</i>

131
00:11:12,614 --> 00:11:16,665
<i>weapons were used in these
unspeakable attacks.</i> - Ethan?

132
00:11:17,051 --> 00:11:19,448
<i>No word on
casualties yet...</i>. - It's time.

133
00:11:19,473 --> 00:11:21,925
<i>but we can assume the
death toll is catastrophic.</i>

134
00:11:21,949 --> 00:11:25,062
<i>Early reports suggest the
weapons used would require a</i>

135
00:11:25,087 --> 00:11:28,424
<i>highly specialized knowledge
that very few people possess.</i>

136
00:11:29,256 --> 00:11:33,483
<i>The question now is who would attack
all three of this holly sites and why.</i>

137
00:11:34,104 --> 00:11:38,231
<i>The attacks occurred at precisely
same moment. Just over an hour ago.</i>

138
00:11:38,527 --> 00:11:42,301
<i>At 4:00 AM ET. Within minutes
of the attack Congress ordered</i>

139
00:11:42,326 --> 00:11:46,038
<i>an emergency recess and the
Capitol building was evacuated.</i>

140
00:11:46,332 --> 00:11:51,182
The President authorized... The White
House has declared state of emergency.

141
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:53,943
<i>Placing the military
at highest alert.</i>

142
00:11:53,944 --> 00:11:55,698
Would you excuse us, please?

143
00:11:57,700 --> 00:11:59,334
Dr. Debruuk...

144
00:12:00,966 --> 00:12:04,464
We know who you are. We read
the Manifesto we found in your lab.

145
00:12:16,014 --> 00:12:18,895
There has never been peace
without first a great suffering.

146
00:12:18,919 --> 00:12:21,584
The greater the suffering,
the greater the peace.

147
00:12:21,853 --> 00:12:23,767
See, this will unite them.

148
00:12:25,426 --> 00:12:27,921
When they read this
manifesto they'll understand.

149
00:12:27,945 --> 00:12:30,166
Nobody's gonna read
that manifesto, ever!

150
00:12:30,587 --> 00:12:32,075
I can promise you that.

151
00:12:32,653 --> 00:12:35,196
What day is it? How
long have I been here?

152
00:12:35,574 --> 00:12:37,519
What's the last
thing you remember?

153
00:12:38,610 --> 00:12:39,609
I was driving...

154
00:12:42,924 --> 00:12:45,090
Someone hit me.
- That was two weeks ago.

155
00:12:46,103 --> 00:12:48,936
Two weeks?
- Two weeks. - This is yours, isn't it?

156
00:12:49,506 --> 00:12:51,665
It's how Lark
communicated with you.

157
00:12:52,348 --> 00:12:54,935
Lark? - John Lark.
We know all about him.

158
00:12:55,385 --> 00:12:58,102
You know nothing!
- It's information in this phone that

159
00:12:58,126 --> 00:13:00,792
could lead us to him.
And you have the pass-code.

160
00:13:00,973 --> 00:13:02,472
You think Lark's the enemy?

161
00:13:04,095 --> 00:13:08,835
You, well, who ever
you are. You're the enemy.

162
00:13:08,945 --> 00:13:13,185
You're why the system survives.
Why the suffering goes on! - Shut up!

163
00:13:13,471 --> 00:13:16,056
We don't care
about you. We want Lark!

164
00:13:16,057 --> 00:13:19,001
What if we make a deal?
- Nah, There's no deal, Luther.

165
00:13:19,274 --> 00:13:20,273
Step outside!

166
00:13:21,703 --> 00:13:24,578
Ethan! - Give me 5 minutes with
this guy! - Ethan, I can't let you do that.

167
00:13:24,602 --> 00:13:27,712
That's not who we are.
- Maybe we need to reconsider that!

168
00:13:28,462 --> 00:13:32,016
What if they read the manifesto
on the air? - What? You can do that?

169
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:33,828
We can do it
with a phone call.

170
00:13:35,420 --> 00:13:40,304
Well, if he reader Larks manifesto...
- No! - I'll give you the pass-code.

171
00:13:41,188 --> 00:13:42,541
Ethan! Ethan!

172
00:13:43,384 --> 00:13:47,636
Think, Ethan. Think of the greater
good. Please! - Yeah, you do that.

173
00:13:55,719 --> 00:13:56,719
Ok.

174
00:14:01,893 --> 00:14:02,893
Sir...

175
00:14:03,317 --> 00:14:04,595
No, he won't cooperate.

176
00:14:05,765 --> 00:14:06,765
Yes, sir.

177
00:14:06,892 --> 00:14:09,040
If we read the manifesto.

178
00:14:10,095 --> 00:14:11,095
On the air.

179
00:14:13,906 --> 00:14:14,906
I'm sorry, sir.

180
00:14:22,613 --> 00:14:26,050
<i>Trading and global
markets plummeting. Stand by,</i>

181
00:14:26,075 --> 00:14:29,717
<i>I'm told we're about to get
some additional information.</i>

182
00:14:31,109 --> 00:14:35,527
<i>I've just been handed a document
from Nils Debruuk, a nuclear weapons</i>

183
00:14:35,552 --> 00:14:40,096
<i>specialist, who claims to have built
the weapons used in these attacks.</i>

184
00:14:40,752 --> 00:14:44,788
<i>I've been asked to read this
manifesto in its entirety.</i>

185
00:14:45,209 --> 00:14:48,431
<i>There has never been peace
without first a great suffering.</i>

186
00:14:48,684 --> 00:14:51,521
<i>The greater the suffering,
the greater the peace.</i>

187
00:14:51,522 --> 00:14:56,210
<i>As mankind is drawn to a
self-destruction like a moth to the candle...</i>

188
00:14:56,418 --> 00:15:01,132
<i>...the so-called defenders of peace:
the Church, the Government, the Law</i>

189
00:15:01,157 --> 00:15:04,151
<i>work tirelessly to save
humanity from itself.</i>

190
00:15:04,576 --> 00:15:06,362
Well, it's not going
to help you now.

191
00:15:06,386 --> 00:15:09,273
<i>But by averting disaster
they serve to delay peace...</i>

192
00:15:09,570 --> 00:15:10,682
What's done is done.

193
00:15:10,805 --> 00:15:17,077
<i>...that can only come trough the
inevitable baptism of fire. The suffering and...</i>

194
00:15:18,228 --> 00:15:20,171
<i>...bringing mutual understanding...</i>

195
00:15:20,195 --> 00:15:21,194
Did we get it?

196
00:15:22,421 --> 00:15:25,308
<i>...it's the first step for the
ultimate project of...</i>

197
00:15:25,448 --> 00:15:26,448
We got it!

198
00:15:30,677 --> 00:15:31,676
Go.

199
00:15:45,386 --> 00:15:46,386
Did we get it?

200
00:15:46,647 --> 00:15:47,758
Of course we got it!

201
00:15:56,810 --> 00:15:58,087
I told you we'd get it.

202
00:15:59,370 --> 00:16:00,426
I don't understand?

203
00:16:00,902 --> 00:16:02,346
The attacks didn't happen?

204
00:16:02,996 --> 00:16:05,942
The car accident you were
in - that was an hour ago.

205
00:16:06,614 --> 00:16:08,523
I was driving the other car.

206
00:16:09,407 --> 00:16:12,441
What's done is done.
When we say it's done.

207
00:16:55,714 --> 00:17:01,564
<b><i>IMPOSSIBLE
FALLOUT</i></b>

208
00:17:13,067 --> 00:17:18,241
<i>AERIAL BASE RAMSTEIN, GERMANY</i>

209
00:17:26,283 --> 00:17:27,282
Sir.

210
00:17:28,207 --> 00:17:31,603
That phone you unlocked lead us to
a server in Iceland but we managed

211
00:17:31,627 --> 00:17:34,903
to decrypt the communicate
between John Lark and this woman:

212
00:17:35,351 --> 00:17:37,684
Alanna Mitsopolis, activist
and philanthropist whose

213
00:17:37,708 --> 00:17:40,279
charity work has earned her
the nickname the White Widow.

214
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:43,676
It's all a front for her real trade:
arms dealing, money laundering.

215
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:46,862
Extensive political connections
provide her with protection.

216
00:17:46,886 --> 00:17:49,038
Lark and the Widow
were meeting tonight to

217
00:17:49,062 --> 00:17:51,459
negotiate the delivery
of unspecified package.

218
00:17:51,483 --> 00:17:54,205
Which we can only assume
is our missing plutonium.

219
00:17:54,395 --> 00:17:57,178
They'll make contact in the private
lounge at the <i>Grand Palais</i> in Paris.

220
00:17:57,202 --> 00:18:00,209
During her annual fund-raising
event. The details are in the file.

221
00:18:00,233 --> 00:18:03,176
If Lark isn't there by
midnight the Widow will leave.

222
00:18:03,481 --> 00:18:06,868
And sell the package to the
highest bidder. Which gives you...

223
00:18:06,936 --> 00:18:08,835
...two hours from
now to find Lark.

224
00:18:09,133 --> 00:18:11,470
Sir, I think there’s
something you need to know.

225
00:18:11,471 --> 00:18:15,636
I'm gonna stop you right there. You
had a terrible choice to make in Berlin.

226
00:18:15,854 --> 00:18:18,053
Recover the plutonium
or save your team.

227
00:18:18,078 --> 00:18:20,688
You chose your team
and now the world's at risk.

228
00:18:20,827 --> 00:18:23,622
Some flaw, deep within
your core being simply won't

229
00:18:23,646 --> 00:18:26,367
allow you to choose
between one life and millions.

230
00:18:27,217 --> 00:18:31,215
You see that as a sign of weakness.
To me, that's your greatest strength.

231
00:18:31,463 --> 00:18:34,445
It also tells me I can
count on you to cover my ass.

232
00:18:34,470 --> 00:18:37,526
Because coming here from <i>CIA</i> was a
lateral move. Some say a step down.

233
00:18:37,550 --> 00:18:40,453
But I did it... because of you.

234
00:18:41,688 --> 00:18:43,021
Don't make me regret it.

235
00:18:55,503 --> 00:18:56,502
Make the call.

236
00:19:00,347 --> 00:19:01,346
Shut them down.

237
00:19:12,707 --> 00:19:13,642
What do you think
you're doing, Erica?

238
00:19:13,792 --> 00:19:17,129
It may be your mission but
this is the <i>CIA</i>- s plane.

239
00:19:17,473 --> 00:19:20,145
It doesn't take off without my say-so.
- We don't have time for this.

240
00:19:20,146 --> 00:19:23,826
I have a team in Paris ready to grab
Lark as soon as he gets to <i>Palais</i>.

241
00:19:23,827 --> 00:19:28,149
A <i>G5</i> standing by to rendition him
to <i>GITMO</i> where waterboard is waiting.

242
00:19:28,150 --> 00:19:31,128
Spend 24 hours we don’t have
to pull a confession we can't

243
00:19:31,152 --> 00:19:33,873
trust from a man we
haven't positively identified?

244
00:19:34,235 --> 00:19:37,502
No. We need reliable
intelligence and we need it now.

245
00:19:38,004 --> 00:19:40,526
This scenario is precisely
why the <i>IMF</i> exists!

246
00:19:40,527 --> 00:19:42,458
The <i>IMF</i> is
<i>Halloween</i>, Alan.

247
00:19:42,505 --> 00:19:45,897
Bunch of grown men in rubber
masks playing <i>Trick or treat</i>.

248
00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:49,046
And if had held on to
the plutonium in Berlin

249
00:19:49,070 --> 00:19:51,236
we wouldn't be having
this conversation.

250
00:19:51,653 --> 00:19:54,448
And his team would be dead.
- Yes, they would.

251
00:19:54,975 --> 00:19:58,092
That's the job. And that's
why I want one of my

252
00:19:58,117 --> 00:20:02,137
own men on the scene.
To appraise the situation.

253
00:20:02,407 --> 00:20:04,192
Agent Walker,
<i>Special Activities</i>.

254
00:20:04,826 --> 00:20:07,088
His reputation precedes.

255
00:20:07,390 --> 00:20:08,501
You use the scalpel.

256
00:20:09,745 --> 00:20:11,499
I prefer a hammer.

257
00:20:11,842 --> 00:20:14,471
The answer is <i>No</i>. I have
operational authority here.

258
00:20:14,495 --> 00:20:17,219
Direct from the President. You have a
problem with that, you take it up with him.

259
00:20:17,243 --> 00:20:19,965
I have already and he
agrees with me. My man goes.

260
00:20:20,576 --> 00:20:22,563
Or no one goes.

261
00:20:30,610 --> 00:20:32,927
No one comes between
you and that plutonium.

262
00:20:32,951 --> 00:20:35,852
Not Hunt, not his
team, not anyone.

263
00:20:54,919 --> 00:20:57,540
The White Widow has spies
in every level of government.

264
00:20:57,564 --> 00:21:02,061
This plain is posing as commercial airliner
so we can jump into France undetected.

265
00:21:02,545 --> 00:21:05,267
Widow’s meeting Lark in a
<i>VIP</i> lounge at midnight.

266
00:21:05,411 --> 00:21:08,854
No one can be a bidder without a
pre-issued electronic <i>ID</i> band.

267
00:21:08,947 --> 00:21:13,279
We've acquired the unique <i>RFID</i>
number for Larks band allowing us to locate it...

268
00:21:13,414 --> 00:21:17,369
...with these. Find that
<i>ID</i> band, you'll find Lark.

269
00:21:18,357 --> 00:21:19,357
Then what?

270
00:21:21,636 --> 00:21:22,635
Then...

271
00:21:24,315 --> 00:21:25,822
I assume his identity.

272
00:21:25,857 --> 00:21:29,165
Make contact with the Widow.
She takes us to the package.

273
00:21:30,281 --> 00:21:32,131
People actually
fall for this shit?

274
00:21:33,671 --> 00:21:35,892
How do you intend to
make Lark cooperate?

275
00:21:38,055 --> 00:21:39,821
I bump him in the crowd.

276
00:21:40,475 --> 00:21:42,734
In 10 seconds he'll look like
any other drunk at the party.

277
00:21:42,749 --> 00:21:44,997
Incoherent,
completely pliable.

278
00:21:45,169 --> 00:21:47,469
After I borrow his face you
walk him out the front door

279
00:21:47,493 --> 00:21:49,541
and hand him over to
Sloans extraction team.

280
00:21:49,565 --> 00:21:52,915
You're not getting rid of me that easily, Hunt.
- That's not what this is about.

281
00:21:52,939 --> 00:21:54,805
Sure it is.

282
00:21:55,225 --> 00:21:57,391
I know you don't
want me on this detail.

283
00:21:57,774 --> 00:21:58,839
But let's face it.

284
00:21:59,418 --> 00:22:02,746
If you made the hard choice
in Berlin I wouldn't be here.

285
00:22:03,269 --> 00:22:06,689
If you hadn't gun down your
<i>Syndicate</i> agent they sent you to find

286
00:22:06,713 --> 00:22:07,936
I wouldn't be here.

287
00:22:09,032 --> 00:22:10,430
That's right. I know all about you.

288
00:22:10,454 --> 00:22:15,064
You're why we don't have living witness
who can identify John Lark. Or the Apostles.

289
00:22:15,322 --> 00:22:19,091
If you have a problem with my
methods you can always stay behind.

290
00:22:19,845 --> 00:22:24,815
Your mission, should you choose
to accept it. Isn't that the thing?

291
00:22:27,100 --> 00:22:28,801
<i>Two minutes to decompression.</i>

292
00:22:29,166 --> 00:22:30,165
Suite up!

293
00:22:30,453 --> 00:22:32,851
The Widow is meeting
Lark in 30 minutes.

294
00:22:49,339 --> 00:22:51,000
<i>10 seconds to decompression.</i>

295
00:22:54,738 --> 00:22:56,123
Is your oxygen on?

296
00:22:58,260 --> 00:23:02,425
There's no atmosphere at this altitude.
I don't need you blacking out on me.

297
00:23:05,212 --> 00:23:08,757
Hey, your heads up display has built-in
guidance system. Follow it to the target.

298
00:23:08,781 --> 00:23:12,668
Open your shoot when the system
says. Not before, definitely not after.

299
00:23:13,020 --> 00:23:16,366
Or the last thing that goes trough your
mind will be your kneecaps. Is that clear?

300
00:23:16,390 --> 00:23:17,390
Crystal.

301
00:23:40,153 --> 00:23:42,097
We gotta talk.
Need to rethink this.

302
00:23:42,323 --> 00:23:46,301
Out of my way, Hunt!
- Walker, we have a problem. There's a storm and we need to...

303
00:23:46,325 --> 00:23:48,707
Enough talk. I'll
see you in Paris!

304
00:23:49,384 --> 00:23:50,383
Shit!

305
00:23:55,177 --> 00:23:56,176
Come on!
Come on!

306
00:24:09,871 --> 00:24:12,433
<i>Altitude, 25000 feet.</i>

307
00:24:19,090 --> 00:24:22,477
<i>Walker!
- What's the matter, Hunt? Afraid of a little lighting?</i>

308
00:24:32,039 --> 00:24:34,336
<i>Altitude, 20000 feet.</i>

309
00:24:34,972 --> 00:24:35,971
<i>Son of a bitch!</i>

310
00:24:37,645 --> 00:24:38,645
<i>Walker?</i>

311
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:41,879
<i>Do you copy?</i>

312
00:24:43,681 --> 00:24:44,681
<i>Walker?</i>

313
00:24:47,146 --> 00:24:49,092
<i>Hang on.
Hang on.</i>

314
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:51,040
<i>Walker?</i>

315
00:24:57,667 --> 00:24:58,667
<i>Come on!</i>

316
00:24:58,668 --> 00:25:00,995
<i>Altitude, 15000 feet.</i>

317
00:25:04,688 --> 00:25:05,687
<i>Walker?</i>

318
00:25:06,607 --> 00:25:07,606
<i>Walker?!</i>

319
00:25:18,808 --> 00:25:19,807
<i>Walker!</i>

320
00:25:20,964 --> 00:25:21,963
<i>Walker!</i>

321
00:25:22,354 --> 00:25:24,822
<i>Altitude, 10000 feet.</i>

322
00:25:28,563 --> 00:25:29,562
<i>9000.</i>

323
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:30,840
<i>Shit!</i>

324
00:25:33,484 --> 00:25:34,484
<i>8000.</i>

325
00:25:37,691 --> 00:25:38,691
<i>7000.</i>

326
00:25:42,822 --> 00:25:43,821
<i>6000.</i>

327
00:25:47,411 --> 00:25:48,411
<i>5000.</i>

328
00:25:51,870 --> 00:25:52,870
<i>4000.</i>

329
00:25:53,147 --> 00:25:54,147
<i>Walker!</i>

330
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:55,399
<i>Walker!</i>

331
00:25:56,618 --> 00:25:57,617
<i>3000.</i>

332
00:25:57,637 --> 00:26:02,427
<i>Deploy! Deploy! Deploy!</i>

333
00:26:17,835 --> 00:26:19,139
Oh, God!

334
00:26:40,617 --> 00:26:42,394
Looks like you lost your oxygen.

335
00:27:05,301 --> 00:27:07,467
That's where the Widow
is meeting Lark.

336
00:27:51,702 --> 00:27:53,011
Walker!

337
00:27:55,741 --> 00:27:56,740
Say again?

338
00:29:54,215 --> 00:29:55,803
The needle?
- Didn't need it.

339
00:29:57,039 --> 00:29:58,039
Get him up!

340
00:30:47,712 --> 00:30:49,865
<i>Do not be shy. The
more, the better.</i>

341
00:30:49,866 --> 00:30:54,157
<i>Come on, we're not bad.
- Can we join in? We don't bite.</i>

342
00:32:49,832 --> 00:32:50,832
Shit.

343
00:33:10,526 --> 00:33:13,637
Can you still make a mask?
- I need a face to make a mask.

344
00:33:13,705 --> 00:33:14,704
Sorry.

345
00:33:15,123 --> 00:33:16,622
I was aiming for his chest.

346
00:33:18,875 --> 00:33:20,758
What are you doing here?
- It's good to see you too.

347
00:33:20,782 --> 00:33:22,817
Sorry, I'm confused. You're?

348
00:33:25,597 --> 00:33:26,596
An old friend.

349
00:33:39,879 --> 00:33:42,069
Cancel extraction.
We're code Blue.

350
00:33:42,632 --> 00:33:44,583
Send sanitation.

351
00:33:45,250 --> 00:33:46,925
That was my team.

352
00:33:48,902 --> 00:33:51,900
You didn't answer my question.
What are you doing here?

353
00:33:54,522 --> 00:33:56,502
That's it. Just take
it easy. That's it.

354
00:33:56,526 --> 00:33:58,480
Just keep your head back
until the bleeding stops.

355
00:33:58,504 --> 00:34:01,791
What is it?!
<i>You want some?!</i>

356
00:34:03,841 --> 00:34:06,118
You're not here by
accident. Who sent you?

357
00:34:06,394 --> 00:34:08,564
I can't tell you that.
- What are you doing?

358
00:34:08,588 --> 00:34:11,324
I have a date with White Widow.
- He had a date with the Widow.

359
00:34:11,348 --> 00:34:14,897
You look nothing like him.
- Now, we have to hope they never met.

360
00:34:15,156 --> 00:34:17,799
Hope is not a strategy!
- You must be new.

361
00:34:18,474 --> 00:34:21,242
I have no other choice.
White Widow is our only lead.

362
00:34:21,266 --> 00:34:23,454
I got to be this guy
for 5 minutes. - Don't do it.

363
00:34:23,455 --> 00:34:26,224
What?
What is it?

364
00:34:26,851 --> 00:34:29,199
What aren't you telling me?
- You don't understand what you're involved in.

365
00:34:29,223 --> 00:34:33,720
I don't understand what I'm involved in?
I don't understand what I'm involved in?!

366
00:34:36,220 --> 00:34:40,441
What am I involved in? - If you're
meeting the Widow she leaves in 3 minutes.

367
00:34:42,217 --> 00:34:43,605
Ethan!
- I'll make it work.

368
00:34:43,706 --> 00:34:45,772
Ethan!
- I'll make it work!

369
00:34:48,230 --> 00:34:51,406
Name's Walker.
- Yeah? You're welcome.

370
00:35:11,110 --> 00:35:13,081
What do you think you're doing?
- I'm going with you.

371
00:35:13,105 --> 00:35:15,198
Like hell you are! - People
have been sent here to kill Lark.

372
00:35:15,222 --> 00:35:18,034
No shit. - No, not me,
contractors. Paid assassins.

373
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:19,780
They don't know
what he looks like.

374
00:35:19,804 --> 00:35:21,454
They only know he's
meeting the Widow at midnight.

375
00:35:21,478 --> 00:35:23,601
If you go trough with this
they're gonna believe you're Lark

376
00:35:23,625 --> 00:35:25,332
and they're gonna kill you.

377
00:35:25,356 --> 00:35:26,978
How do you know all of this?

378
00:35:28,413 --> 00:35:29,663
I can't tell you that.

379
00:35:32,483 --> 00:35:34,482
You should've
stayed out of the game.

380
00:35:36,593 --> 00:35:38,400
You should've come with me.

381
00:35:47,065 --> 00:35:49,987
This charity was started
in honor of my mother.

382
00:35:51,066 --> 00:35:53,690
Those of you who knew her
understood her strength.

383
00:35:53,714 --> 00:35:56,593
Her tenacity. Her
resourcefulness.

384
00:35:58,090 --> 00:36:00,171
But there was another side to her.

385
00:36:00,909 --> 00:36:02,886
The side most people never saw.

386
00:36:03,425 --> 00:36:07,868
It's that part of her spirit that
has brought us all together tonight.

387
00:36:09,230 --> 00:36:11,807
Max was something of a paradox.

388
00:36:14,504 --> 00:36:17,244
She had a fascination for paradoxes.

389
00:36:17,842 --> 00:36:20,362
A fascination she
passed onto me.

390
00:36:22,596 --> 00:36:26,409
Max had no illusions about
the world we live in today.

391
00:36:27,313 --> 00:36:30,440
But she had dreams of
a very different future.

392
00:36:31,455 --> 00:36:34,861
One in which her unique
talents were no longer required.

393
00:36:35,782 --> 00:36:38,400
All she earned from
the way the world is

394
00:36:38,425 --> 00:36:41,662
went ultimately to making
it what it could someday be.

395
00:36:42,935 --> 00:36:45,185
That future isn't here yet.

396
00:36:46,683 --> 00:36:51,199
Tonight your contributions
have brought it just a little closer.

397
00:36:54,990 --> 00:36:58,127
Go with the opportunity.
Enjoy the party.

398
00:37:18,691 --> 00:37:21,612
You can't possibly be John Lark?

399
00:37:25,414 --> 00:37:27,249
I'm not, actually.

400
00:37:28,384 --> 00:37:30,405
It's an alias.

401
00:37:32,359 --> 00:37:35,696
I suppose it's better than John Doe.
Is there another name you prefer?

402
00:37:35,697 --> 00:37:39,971
Is there somewhere we can talk privately?
- I like Lark. It has a certain ring.

403
00:37:39,972 --> 00:37:42,672
We don't have a lot of time.
- I'll be honest with you.

404
00:37:42,696 --> 00:37:45,639
A man with your reputation.
I was expecting someone...

405
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:47,752
...uglier.

406
00:37:48,278 --> 00:37:51,780
Don't let looks deceive because I'm as ugly
as they come. Now I'll be honest with you.

407
00:37:51,781 --> 00:37:53,987
Your life's in danger.

408
00:37:54,996 --> 00:37:58,043
Don't you touch her.
- Relax, he's my brother.

409
00:37:59,246 --> 00:38:01,301
You're being rude
to our guest, Zola.

410
00:38:01,553 --> 00:38:02,553
It's time to go.

411
00:38:03,208 --> 00:38:04,894
Don't turn this into a scene.

412
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:08,809
You don't leave this room.

413
00:38:15,483 --> 00:38:17,810
You see?
- Your life's in danger.

414
00:38:18,906 --> 00:38:21,905
And who'd want to kill me?
- The Americans for starters.

415
00:38:22,366 --> 00:38:26,309
Duly noted. - You think you're the
only one with spies in the government?

416
00:38:26,722 --> 00:38:29,901
There are people here who
don't want this meeting to happen.

417
00:38:29,925 --> 00:38:31,460
Don't believe me?

418
00:38:32,001 --> 00:38:33,396
Look around.

419
00:38:45,544 --> 00:38:47,105
I know what you're thinking.

420
00:38:47,763 --> 00:38:51,206
Maybe they're not here for you.
Maybe they're just here for me.

421
00:38:51,725 --> 00:38:53,767
Are you willing
to take that chance?

422
00:38:54,666 --> 00:38:56,516
You have something I want.

423
00:38:56,917 --> 00:39:01,471
Right now that makes me the only person
you can trust to get you out of here alive.

424
00:39:01,540 --> 00:39:04,095
Or would you rather
leave that to your brother?

425
00:39:08,441 --> 00:39:11,284
I think I'd like to
go home now, Mr. Lark.

426
00:41:26,919 --> 00:41:29,839
The French government will
receive the asset they took in today.

427
00:41:29,863 --> 00:41:33,734
Delivery will be by air to the finance
ministry at 8:00 AM tomorrow morning.

428
00:41:33,758 --> 00:41:37,789
Another motorcade under heavy police
escort will transport him on along this root.

429
00:41:37,813 --> 00:41:41,184
We'll create a diversion
at this intersection. Here.

430
00:41:41,460 --> 00:41:45,347
Motorcade will automatically take
the pre-planned alternate root, here.

431
00:41:45,676 --> 00:41:47,342
Where we'll extract the asset.

432
00:41:48,571 --> 00:41:50,698
Extract the asset?

433
00:42:01,965 --> 00:42:02,964
The asset?

434
00:42:05,454 --> 00:42:08,053
We've payed a great deal
of money for this information.

435
00:42:08,076 --> 00:42:10,409
They gave us everything
but this mans name.

436
00:42:11,190 --> 00:42:13,523
You don't happen to
know who he is, do you?

437
00:42:14,557 --> 00:42:18,111
His name is Solomon Lane.
British special agent turned anarchist.

438
00:42:19,841 --> 00:42:24,227
He used rogue covert operatives to
create a terror network called the Syndicate.

439
00:42:25,485 --> 00:42:28,155
Sabotage, assassination,
mass murder...

440
00:42:28,764 --> 00:42:30,791
Ugly as they come.

441
00:42:31,441 --> 00:42:34,114
He was captured by
American agents two years ago.

442
00:42:34,899 --> 00:42:37,787
Since then he's been under
never-ending interrogation.

443
00:42:38,066 --> 00:42:40,575
Passed around from one
government to another.

444
00:42:41,672 --> 00:42:43,566
To answer for his crimes.

445
00:42:46,647 --> 00:42:48,680
You seem displeased, Lark?

446
00:42:49,001 --> 00:42:51,675
Perhaps I didn't make myself clear.

447
00:42:52,569 --> 00:42:55,154
I came to Paris for plutonium.

448
00:42:55,328 --> 00:42:57,546
Well, there must
be a misunderstanding.

449
00:42:57,967 --> 00:43:01,709
I'm just a broker. I
connect a buyer and a seller.

450
00:43:02,450 --> 00:43:06,115
My seller isn't interested in cash.
So if you want the plutonium...

451
00:43:07,168 --> 00:43:10,490
Extract Lane and make a trade.

452
00:43:11,630 --> 00:43:12,629
That's right.

453
00:43:17,620 --> 00:43:19,896
How do I know the seller
has what I want.

454
00:43:39,096 --> 00:43:40,651
A down-payment in good faith.

455
00:43:41,858 --> 00:43:45,031
The Currier we'll deliver
two more within 48 hours.

456
00:43:45,156 --> 00:43:48,327
In exchange for him.

457
00:43:56,298 --> 00:43:57,298
All right.

458
00:43:57,691 --> 00:43:59,448
What happens after diversion?

459
00:45:33,431 --> 00:45:34,430
Kill everyone?

460
00:45:35,275 --> 00:45:36,274
That's your plan?

461
00:45:36,821 --> 00:45:38,542
There'll be no witnesses.

462
00:45:39,102 --> 00:45:42,067
What's my guarantee that
Lane walks out of this thing alive?

463
00:45:42,091 --> 00:45:43,559
He's in an armored box.

464
00:45:44,220 --> 00:45:46,053
We'll pull him out
when it's safe.

465
00:45:46,780 --> 00:45:48,417
You want your plutonium?

466
00:45:48,749 --> 00:45:50,349
This is the price.

467
00:45:52,407 --> 00:45:54,573
Or do you draw the
line at killing cops?

468
00:45:55,012 --> 00:45:56,966
That's John Lark
you're talking to.

469
00:46:00,037 --> 00:46:02,905
I've murdered women
and children with smallpox.

470
00:46:05,516 --> 00:46:07,151
I have no line.

471
00:46:11,603 --> 00:46:12,603
Right.

472
00:46:13,009 --> 00:46:15,794
Sleep well, everyone.
Busy day tomorrow.

473
00:46:36,348 --> 00:46:38,062
You have got to be kidding me?

474
00:46:38,519 --> 00:46:41,309
If you want Lane out of
prison this is how he gets out.

475
00:46:41,333 --> 00:46:43,888
I wanted Lark to brake
him out, not Ethan Hunt.

476
00:46:44,051 --> 00:46:47,938
I wanted Lark at the
exchange, not Ethan Hunt.

477
00:46:48,525 --> 00:46:52,523
I wanted Lark to lead us to
the plutonium and the Apostles.

478
00:46:53,197 --> 00:46:54,864
You may still
get your chance.

479
00:46:54,897 --> 00:46:57,337
Have you forgotten about the
corpse we pulled out of men's room

480
00:46:57,361 --> 00:47:00,074
at the <i>Grand Palais</i>?
- I'm guessing that wasn't Lark.

481
00:47:00,098 --> 00:47:03,930
More likely one of Larks recruits.
- Not according to our intelligence.

482
00:47:04,036 --> 00:47:05,702
Intelligence gathered by whom?

483
00:47:08,283 --> 00:47:09,282
Hunt.

484
00:47:10,422 --> 00:47:13,532
You long held suspicions that
Lark was an American agent.

485
00:47:13,868 --> 00:47:18,033
Someone who knew our every move.
Someone who could come and go like a ghost.

486
00:47:19,307 --> 00:47:22,039
You're suggesting
Hunt is John Lark?

487
00:47:23,055 --> 00:47:26,865
You're reaching, Walker.
Trying to save your ass.

488
00:47:27,474 --> 00:47:28,474
It won't work.

489
00:47:29,129 --> 00:47:33,887
Think about it. Would a man as careful
as Lark really stick his neck out like that?

490
00:47:34,387 --> 00:47:36,664
For a face to face
with the White Widow?

491
00:47:36,999 --> 00:47:39,317
He'd send a proxy.
- A decoy.

492
00:47:39,688 --> 00:47:42,483
If he was really smart
he'd had his lady friend

493
00:47:42,508 --> 00:47:45,301
kill that decoy in front
of a reliable witness.

494
00:47:46,123 --> 00:47:47,122
Me.

495
00:47:47,641 --> 00:47:50,640
The dragnet is closing down
on his terrorist alter-ego.

496
00:47:50,918 --> 00:47:54,672
So he pays a man to play the
part of Lark and has him killed.

497
00:47:55,532 --> 00:47:57,806
And under the guise
of serving his country...

498
00:47:57,830 --> 00:48:00,751
Assumes his own secret identity.

499
00:48:01,073 --> 00:48:04,850
Free to operate at will with the
full support of US government. - Why?

500
00:48:05,787 --> 00:48:07,431
Why would Hunt turn?

501
00:48:08,210 --> 00:48:11,035
Why did Lane do it?
Why did any of his Apostles?

502
00:48:11,735 --> 00:48:14,580
They were believers in a cause.

503
00:48:15,255 --> 00:48:19,476
And when that cause turned out to
be a lie they turned against their masters.

504
00:48:19,931 --> 00:48:22,688
How many times has Hunts
government betrayed him,

505
00:48:22,713 --> 00:48:25,039
disavowed him,
casted him aside?

506
00:48:25,477 --> 00:48:29,338
And how long before a man
like that has had enough?

507
00:48:30,693 --> 00:48:33,133
That is a serious accusation.

508
00:48:35,032 --> 00:48:36,264
Can you prove it?

509
00:48:40,428 --> 00:48:43,982
This is the phone we pulled of the
dead body at the <i>Grand Palais</i>.

510
00:48:49,010 --> 00:48:51,343
I'm guessing it has
all the proof you need.

511
00:50:55,520 --> 00:50:58,186
Is it true Lane gassed
a village of 2000 people?

512
00:51:00,793 --> 00:51:01,793
Yes.

513
00:51:01,794 --> 00:51:05,792
Is it true he brought down an entire
passenger plane just to kill one man?

514
00:51:06,811 --> 00:51:07,811
Yes.

515
00:51:09,179 --> 00:51:12,165
Is it true that he...
- Walker, whatever you heard.

516
00:51:12,190 --> 00:51:15,056
If it makes your skin
crawl, it's probably true.

517
00:51:22,217 --> 00:51:23,216
Holy shit!

518
00:51:25,228 --> 00:51:27,561
You're the guy that
caught him, aren't you?

519
00:51:29,461 --> 00:51:32,404
How long do you think he's
gonna keep that to himself?

520
00:51:36,143 --> 00:51:38,364
We'll burn that bridge
when we get to it.

521
00:52:28,085 --> 00:52:29,084
Close it.

522
00:54:06,468 --> 00:54:07,950
What the hell is he doing?

523
00:55:39,320 --> 00:55:41,237
<i>NO SIGNAL</i>

524
00:56:21,404 --> 00:56:23,569
Hunt, <i>where are you?</i>
- Don't wait for me!

525
00:56:24,743 --> 00:56:26,138
<i>Wanna do... What's wrong?</i>

526
00:56:27,797 --> 00:56:29,972
I'll meet you at the garage!

527
00:56:38,768 --> 00:56:40,134
Benji, do you copy?!

528
00:56:40,631 --> 00:56:44,509
We copy. Go.<i> - Change of plan.
I'm glued. Need extraction!</i>

529
00:56:45,107 --> 00:56:46,106
We're on our way!

530
00:57:01,145 --> 00:57:03,197
<i>He's driving from Notre
Dame to the Saint</i>

531
00:57:03,221 --> 00:57:05,664
<i>Louis bridge. Police
patrols are chasing him.</i>

532
01:01:26,530 --> 01:01:27,530
<i>STOP!</i>

533
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:29,307
<i>Stay where you are!</i>

534
01:01:30,460 --> 01:01:31,459
Get in the car.

535
01:01:32,353 --> 01:01:33,352
<i>Nobody move!</i>

536
01:01:36,907 --> 01:01:37,963
<i>Show me your hands!</i>

537
01:01:40,139 --> 01:01:42,017
<i>Go away, please.</i>

538
01:01:42,410 --> 01:01:44,001
<i>Show me your hands!</i>

539
01:01:48,116 --> 01:01:49,754
<i>Don’t worry, please.</i>

540
01:01:50,384 --> 01:01:52,788
<i>Go away, please.</i>

541
01:01:54,039 --> 01:01:55,943
<i>Go away, please.</i>

542
01:02:02,104 --> 01:02:03,935
Zola wants a word with you.

543
01:02:08,097 --> 01:02:10,294
<i>What do we do with her?
- Kill her.</i>

544
01:02:41,042 --> 01:02:42,305
<i>You will be fine.</i>

545
01:02:49,269 --> 01:02:50,571
<i>You will be fine.</i>

546
01:02:50,928 --> 01:02:51,928
We gotta go!

547
01:02:53,250 --> 01:02:55,180
<i>I am so sorry.</i>
- Come on!

548
01:03:32,677 --> 01:03:34,288
The name's Walker by the way.

549
01:03:34,328 --> 01:03:36,186
Was the little car your idea?

550
01:03:46,673 --> 01:03:47,673
Jesus Christ!

551
01:03:48,738 --> 01:03:50,636
What the hell was that?!

552
01:03:56,542 --> 01:03:58,318
Everybody, out!
- Go, go, go!

553
01:06:36,095 --> 01:06:37,095
That was Ilsa.

554
01:06:37,691 --> 01:06:38,691
Shut up!

555
01:06:39,429 --> 01:06:40,428
Very interesting.

556
01:06:44,546 --> 01:06:46,670
It's good to see
you again, Ethan.

557
01:07:24,471 --> 01:07:26,309
Look who's still alive.

558
01:07:30,367 --> 01:07:33,814
There's a microwave tracker in his neck.
- Ok. You know what to do.

559
01:07:33,838 --> 01:07:37,059
Let me just assure you
this won't hurt... enough.

560
01:07:39,654 --> 01:07:40,654
90 seconds.

561
01:07:42,196 --> 01:07:45,999
You and the Apostles think we're
gonna trade you for the missing plutonium.

562
01:07:46,023 --> 01:07:48,646
I'm here to tell you
that's never gonna happen.

563
01:07:48,671 --> 01:07:51,347
Your mission, should
you choose to accept it...

564
01:07:53,034 --> 01:07:56,233
I wander, Ethan, did
you ever choose not to?

565
01:07:57,213 --> 01:08:01,062
Did you ever stop and ask yourself
who's giving you the orders or why?

566
01:08:02,426 --> 01:08:06,701
When everyday the master you serve
is one step closer to ending the world.

567
01:08:07,068 --> 01:08:09,452
Strange accusation
coming from a terrorist.

568
01:08:09,476 --> 01:08:12,346
60 seconds. - Terrorists are
schoolboys, desperate for attention.

569
01:08:12,370 --> 01:08:15,343
Hoping to shape public
opinion trough fear.

570
01:08:16,368 --> 01:08:19,264
I don't care in the least
what people think or feel.

571
01:08:19,955 --> 01:08:22,756
In my experience they
don't do either for very long.

572
01:08:22,780 --> 01:08:26,669
I suppose that justifies bombing
factories or bringing down civilian aircraft.

573
01:08:26,693 --> 01:08:28,637
Or strapping me
into explosive vest!

574
01:08:29,119 --> 01:08:32,173
Consider it unfinished
business, my funny little friend.

575
01:08:32,426 --> 01:08:33,592
Luther?
- Almost there.

576
01:08:34,005 --> 01:08:36,282
You see the end as
clearly as I do, Ethan.

577
01:08:36,306 --> 01:08:39,304
Governments the world over
are descending into madness.

578
01:08:39,476 --> 01:08:43,413
The Syndicate was created to
tear them down. Brick by brick.

579
01:08:43,623 --> 01:08:45,480
The Syndicate was a pack
of murdering cowards!

580
01:08:45,504 --> 01:08:48,150
The Syndicate was
civilizations last hope!

581
01:08:49,028 --> 01:08:51,892
A chance to smash
the old world order.

582
01:08:52,991 --> 01:08:57,405
That hope is gone now because
of you and your pathetic morality.

583
01:08:59,624 --> 01:09:01,764
You should have
killed me, Ethan.

584
01:09:04,125 --> 01:09:07,653
The end you always
feared, it's coming.

585
01:09:10,844 --> 01:09:12,827
It's coming.

586
01:09:13,758 --> 01:09:16,371
And her blood will
be on your hands.

587
01:09:19,023 --> 01:09:23,458
The fallout.
For all your good intentions.

588
01:09:30,516 --> 01:09:32,473
Time!
- Got it!

589
01:09:57,347 --> 01:09:58,347
Get him up!

590
01:10:01,337 --> 01:10:02,337
You're mine now!

591
01:10:11,844 --> 01:10:16,342
You're just full of surprises, Lark.
- Your brothers plan was bad from the word <i>go</i>.

592
01:10:16,644 --> 01:10:20,309
You'd lost all your men and Lane
would've been killed in crossfire.

593
01:10:21,110 --> 01:10:22,564
I had to improvise.

594
01:10:23,561 --> 01:10:25,505
Why not say that
in the first place?

595
01:10:26,109 --> 01:10:29,552
Because I don't trust your
people. Especially not your brother.

596
01:10:33,852 --> 01:10:34,851
Family,

597
01:10:35,301 --> 01:10:36,914
what can you do?

598
01:10:39,731 --> 01:10:41,381
So where's Lane?

599
01:10:41,945 --> 01:10:44,167
Certainly not at the
bottom of the Seine.

600
01:10:44,470 --> 01:10:46,134
I have him.
He's safe.

601
01:10:46,890 --> 01:10:48,581
Where do I meet the Currier?

602
01:10:50,295 --> 01:10:51,951
Let's talk about the woman.

603
01:10:53,925 --> 01:10:54,924
Woman?

604
01:10:55,260 --> 01:10:58,335
She was with you at the <i>Palais</i>.
Zola saw her again today.

605
01:10:58,359 --> 01:11:02,080
She tried to kill Lane. She had a
chance to kill you but she didn't.

606
01:11:02,762 --> 01:11:03,762
Why?

607
01:11:07,516 --> 01:11:09,057
We have a past.

608
01:11:10,397 --> 01:11:11,396
It's complicated.

609
01:11:13,705 --> 01:11:16,093
Well, I'll make it more
complicated for you.

610
01:11:16,581 --> 01:11:18,086
My price just went up.

611
01:11:18,839 --> 01:11:21,950
Someone killed four of my
men today. I assume it was her.

612
01:11:29,054 --> 01:11:30,544
I want her, Lark.

613
01:11:31,587 --> 01:11:33,364
And you're gonna
bring her to me.

614
01:11:34,607 --> 01:11:39,104
Otherwise you don't meet the Currier and
the plutonium goes to the highest bidder.

615
01:11:39,941 --> 01:11:42,080
I'd hate for her to
come between us.

616
01:11:46,703 --> 01:11:47,703
She's yours.

617
01:11:48,989 --> 01:11:51,170
At the meeting.
Not before.

618
01:12:03,685 --> 01:12:05,048
Go to London.

619
01:12:06,012 --> 01:12:07,692
Instructions will follow.

620
01:13:49,595 --> 01:13:52,316
I knew if I followed her
you'd show up eventually.

621
01:13:52,388 --> 01:13:53,388
You Ok?

622
01:13:56,487 --> 01:13:59,098
Ilsa, I'd never...
- I know you had your reasons.

623
01:14:00,426 --> 01:14:01,426
I know.

624
01:14:05,660 --> 01:14:08,231
You need to walk away.
- I can't do that.

625
01:14:10,177 --> 01:14:12,288
You weren't at the
<i>Palais</i> to kill Lark.

626
01:14:12,743 --> 01:14:13,743
No.

627
01:14:15,774 --> 01:14:17,440
You were there to protect him.

628
01:14:17,957 --> 01:14:18,956
Yes.

629
01:14:19,433 --> 01:14:21,482
And you killed him
to protect me.

630
01:14:23,379 --> 01:14:25,612
You wanted Lark
to break Lane out.

631
01:14:27,261 --> 01:14:29,894
No, you needed him
to break Lane out.

632
01:14:31,269 --> 01:14:33,019
Because you have to kill Lane.

633
01:14:34,797 --> 01:14:36,246
Who's making you do this?

634
01:14:38,330 --> 01:14:40,068
<i>MI6</i>.

635
01:14:42,648 --> 01:14:43,648
Why?

636
01:14:43,904 --> 01:14:46,201
After we captured him
in London they tried to

637
01:14:46,225 --> 01:14:48,558
bring Lane home trough
diplomatic channels.

638
01:14:48,953 --> 01:14:51,675
But too many countries
won't their pound of flesh.

639
01:14:51,729 --> 01:14:55,604
A man like that, what he's seen.
What he knows about British intelligence.

640
01:14:55,628 --> 01:14:58,682
They can't have him
talking to foreign government, ever.

641
01:14:58,819 --> 01:15:00,388
That's not what I'm asking.

642
01:15:01,610 --> 01:15:03,345
Why did they sent you?

643
01:15:03,894 --> 01:15:05,968
This is how I prove my loyalty.

644
01:15:07,281 --> 01:15:09,816
This is how I come home.
- But you were out!?

645
01:15:10,512 --> 01:15:13,205
You were free?
- We're never free.

646
01:15:14,485 --> 01:15:19,268
I've spent two years undercover with Lane.
To them I'm as much of a threat as he is.

647
01:15:21,165 --> 01:15:24,540
I kill him or I
never stop running.

648
01:15:26,796 --> 01:15:29,179
Now, tell me where he is?

649
01:15:34,148 --> 01:15:38,389
I can't help you.
- I'll get to him one way or another.

650
01:15:39,610 --> 01:15:42,186
Please, don't make
me go trough you.

651
01:16:38,452 --> 01:16:39,452
Yes?

652
01:16:39,619 --> 01:16:41,708
Are you here in London?
<i>- I am.</i>

653
01:16:42,584 --> 01:16:44,472
Are you ready
to meet the Currier?

654
01:16:45,323 --> 01:16:47,117
<i>Yes.
Where do I go?</i>

655
01:16:47,910 --> 01:16:49,743
Where would you like to meet?

656
01:16:52,543 --> 01:16:53,543
<i>LOCATING CALLER</i>

657
01:17:27,890 --> 01:17:28,890
Mr. Secretary?

658
01:17:29,805 --> 01:17:31,971
I've prayed to God
that it wasn't truth.

659
01:17:32,014 --> 01:17:34,613
Well, in his defense, sir,
if Ethan hadn't intervened

660
01:17:34,637 --> 01:17:36,728
the great many people
would've been killed.

661
01:17:36,752 --> 01:17:39,601
Yes, Dunn, I'm sure that the good
people of Paris and the nation of France

662
01:17:39,625 --> 01:17:42,423
as a whole will take
that into account.

663
01:17:43,151 --> 01:17:44,664
So, what the hell happened?

664
01:18:04,130 --> 01:18:06,629
At which point we were
told to come to London.

665
01:18:07,453 --> 01:18:10,397
And await further instructions.
- And what happens now?

666
01:18:11,120 --> 01:18:12,119
Now?

667
01:18:13,414 --> 01:18:14,890
We meet the Widow in 20 minutes.

668
01:18:14,914 --> 01:18:17,349
She's gonna take us to
Currier who'll hand over our

669
01:18:17,373 --> 01:18:19,593
missing plutonium in
exchange for Solomon Lane.

670
01:18:19,617 --> 01:18:21,142
Or in our scenario...

671
01:18:22,456 --> 01:18:23,455
Benji.

672
01:18:24,241 --> 01:18:25,241
Jesus!

673
01:18:25,628 --> 01:18:26,628
I'm sorry, what?

674
01:18:26,957 --> 01:18:28,353
Luther and I are gonna
take you to Currier.

675
01:18:28,377 --> 01:18:31,203
Walker stays here and guards
the real Lane. - Absolutely not!

676
01:18:31,227 --> 01:18:33,670
Wait, wait! Why do I
have to be Lane? - Benji.

677
01:18:33,984 --> 01:18:38,596
Our mission, my mission is to recover
that plutonium and I will do so at any cost!

678
01:18:38,847 --> 01:18:41,763
Even if I have to
trade Lane. The real Lane!

679
01:18:42,181 --> 01:18:43,786
And I'll never let him go!

680
01:18:44,125 --> 01:18:46,902
When the Apostles realize
that you're playing games

681
01:18:47,183 --> 01:18:49,456
you'll lose
the plutonium. Again!

682
01:18:49,837 --> 01:18:51,574
You let us worry
about the Apostles.

683
01:18:51,598 --> 01:18:54,059
As it stands we have
a bigger problem.

684
01:18:54,408 --> 01:18:55,407
A bigger problem.

685
01:18:56,578 --> 01:19:00,831
Ilsa. - Ilsa? Our Ilsa? Ilsa Faust?
How's she mixed up in all of this?

686
01:19:00,955 --> 01:19:03,539
She's been ordered to kill Lane.
Direct from <i>MI6</i>.

687
01:19:03,563 --> 01:19:07,428
Look. Wait. So that was her
in Paris? On the bike? - Yeah.

688
01:19:07,597 --> 01:19:09,414
Ethan, she tried
to kill us! - No, not us.

689
01:19:09,438 --> 01:19:11,445
Yeah! - Not us, Lane.
She tried to kill Lane.

690
01:19:11,446 --> 01:19:14,655
She has no choice. - And she'll
kill me! - I'm not gonna let that happen!

691
01:19:14,656 --> 01:19:17,543
Ethan, how exactly are you
not gonna let that happen?

692
01:19:19,036 --> 01:19:20,931
I'm working on it.
- Oh, he's working on it.

693
01:19:20,955 --> 01:19:22,352
Right now we don't
have a lot of time.

694
01:19:22,376 --> 01:19:23,880
We have to start getting
ready for this meeting.

695
01:19:23,904 --> 01:19:25,250
The meeting is a trap.

696
01:19:26,813 --> 01:19:30,923
The White Widow is working with the <i>CIA</i>.
She has been since the beginning.

697
01:19:31,259 --> 01:19:33,814
Bargaining for immunity
is her stock and trade.

698
01:19:34,063 --> 01:19:36,481
Capturing the plutonium and
the Apostles and John Lark

699
01:19:36,505 --> 01:19:39,043
buys her a lot of good
will with the Americans.

700
01:19:39,067 --> 01:19:42,489
But if Sloan knew the meeting was
a trap why didn't she just tell us?

701
01:19:42,490 --> 01:19:46,211
Because in her mind anybody could
be John Lark. Including one of us.

702
01:19:47,637 --> 01:19:49,636
And now her
suspicions are confirmed.

703
01:19:52,133 --> 01:19:55,325
According to that dossier a
trail of electronic evidence

704
01:19:55,350 --> 01:19:58,318
connects Hunt to the theft
of smallpox from the <i>CDC</i>.

705
01:19:59,208 --> 01:20:01,457
It also links him to a
lengthy correspondence

706
01:20:01,481 --> 01:20:03,814
ending with the recruitment
of Dr. Debruuk.

707
01:20:04,008 --> 01:20:07,562
And of course Hunt handed over
the plutonium to Apostles himself.

708
01:20:08,225 --> 01:20:12,778
Now, those facts coupled with a long
and incriminating history of rogue behavior

709
01:20:13,267 --> 01:20:16,225
collaborate a <i>CIA</i> narrative

710
01:20:16,684 --> 01:20:18,214
that Hunt has snapped.

711
01:20:19,173 --> 01:20:23,338
And the search for Lark is nothing
but a cover to hide the fact that Lark...

712
01:20:24,380 --> 01:20:25,379
... Is me.

713
01:20:27,521 --> 01:20:30,520
I gotta hand it to you, Ethan.
Normally when people refer to

714
01:20:30,544 --> 01:20:33,653
you as your own worst enemy
it's just a figure of speech.

715
01:20:38,488 --> 01:20:41,264
I'm afraid Sloan got some
questions for her as well.

716
01:20:41,807 --> 01:20:44,251
The Widow offered her
up at no extra charge.

717
01:20:45,204 --> 01:20:47,426
And where did Sloan
get this information?

718
01:20:48,110 --> 01:20:49,689
She didn't say.

719
01:20:50,314 --> 01:20:52,670
She did, however, grant me
the opportunity to bring you

720
01:20:52,694 --> 01:20:54,853
in on the condition that
I terminate this mission.

721
01:20:54,877 --> 01:20:56,967
And hand over
Solomon Lane personally.

722
01:20:57,987 --> 01:21:02,445
Sir, you can't do that. - Hunt! - No, I
know Lane. He has no intention of going back.

723
01:21:02,469 --> 01:21:07,078
That's why we're taking him back!
- Which means that's exactly what he wont us to do.

724
01:21:07,229 --> 01:21:09,565
Ethan.
- Sir, what do you think, this is a coincidence?

725
01:21:09,589 --> 01:21:11,898
That Sloan just happened to found this?
Lane had it sent to her!

726
01:21:11,922 --> 01:21:16,439
He know how she'd react. Just like he knew
the Widow would turn us in. Don't you see?

727
01:21:16,463 --> 01:21:19,684
This, sir.
This is the trap!

728
01:21:20,286 --> 01:21:24,839
We're being directed. - Hunt! - Sir, there
are still two plutonium cores in the wind!

729
01:21:24,946 --> 01:21:26,847
And you lost them!

730
01:21:29,143 --> 01:21:31,866
In fairness, sir,
we all lost them.

731
01:21:32,203 --> 01:21:33,915
Respectfully, sir.

732
01:21:34,437 --> 01:21:38,435
You weren't there.
- So, making excuses for him is your full-time job now?!

733
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:42,315
Good God, Ethan. Don't make
this any harder than it already is.

734
01:21:42,339 --> 01:21:45,305
I can no longer protect you!
Don't you understand that?

735
01:21:45,329 --> 01:21:48,282
This is as close as you're ever
gonna get to that plutonium!

736
01:21:48,306 --> 01:21:51,605
Sir, you don't actually believe this?
- I believe I've been given a choice

737
01:21:51,629 --> 01:21:54,976
to protect you or the <i>IMF</i>.
Which is why I'm bringing you in.

738
01:21:56,077 --> 01:21:59,411
And if I refuse?
- What do you think he's here for?!

739
01:21:59,869 --> 01:22:02,424
You think he's some
observer? He's an assassin!

740
01:22:02,852 --> 01:22:05,153
Erica Sloans number one <i>plumber</i>.

741
01:22:05,575 --> 01:22:08,241
You go rogue, he's
authorized to hunt you down...

742
01:22:08,658 --> 01:22:10,121
...and kill you.

743
01:22:13,648 --> 01:22:14,648
It's the job.

744
01:22:14,853 --> 01:22:15,853
No hard feeling.

745
01:22:16,605 --> 01:22:19,881
Except it, Ethan. You've lost
this one. What's done is done.

746
01:22:21,919 --> 01:22:22,918
No, sir.

747
01:22:23,554 --> 01:22:24,554
No.

748
01:22:24,930 --> 01:22:29,746
I'm not asking you. I'm giving you a
direct order. This mission is terminated.

749
01:22:30,636 --> 01:22:31,636
Now!

750
01:22:34,969 --> 01:22:38,801
Stickell, he's your friend. Would you,
please, talk some sense into...

751
01:22:40,760 --> 01:22:43,037
I'm sorry, sir. But
you left me no choice.

752
01:22:45,701 --> 01:22:47,925
There's 15 minutes before we meet
the Widow. You want the plutonium?

753
01:22:47,949 --> 01:22:49,997
We're the only ones
who can get it for you.

754
01:22:50,021 --> 01:22:51,729
You're in or out?!

755
01:22:52,906 --> 01:22:53,906
In.

756
01:22:54,044 --> 01:22:56,518
What are you doing?
- Benji needs to get ready.

757
01:22:56,541 --> 01:22:59,929
No! Ethan... - There's no time,
Luther. I need you to trust me.

758
01:23:17,131 --> 01:23:18,131
You're all right?

759
01:23:18,695 --> 01:23:19,695
Yeah, I just...

760
01:23:20,548 --> 01:23:22,603
...gotta a bad feeling
about this one.

761
01:23:48,502 --> 01:23:50,058
If you don't hear from us...

762
01:23:50,475 --> 01:23:51,475
I'll do it my way.

763
01:23:55,981 --> 01:23:57,592
Don't take your eyes off him.

764
01:24:34,345 --> 01:24:36,342
Enough games. I'll
take you out of here.

765
01:24:36,366 --> 01:24:37,759
Where's Hunt?

766
01:24:38,191 --> 01:24:41,301
He's gone to the meeting.
With a copy of you. - Calm down.

767
01:24:41,423 --> 01:24:44,915
Call the Apostles. Warn them.
- I have no way of contacting them.

768
01:24:44,939 --> 01:24:46,539
For their safety and mine.

769
01:24:46,916 --> 01:24:49,067
But I do have an extraction
team and satellite over-watch

770
01:24:49,091 --> 01:24:50,804
at pre-arranged <i>rendezvous</i>.

771
01:24:50,828 --> 01:24:53,210
They'll know as soon as
we leave the building. - No.

772
01:24:53,234 --> 01:24:56,493
I'm staying here.
I haven't finished with Hunt yet.

773
01:25:00,920 --> 01:25:04,239
Why did you have to make
this so fucking complicated?!

774
01:25:04,903 --> 01:25:08,069
I don't understand what do
you mean? - The deal was simple.

775
01:25:08,194 --> 01:25:10,897
I help you frame Hunt.
You give me plutonium.

776
01:25:11,560 --> 01:25:16,340
You're wasting time! - There can not
be peace without first a great suffering.

777
01:25:17,073 --> 01:25:19,739
The greater the suffering,
the greater the peace.

778
01:25:20,101 --> 01:25:24,715
When I wrote those words I wasn't
referring to your peace. Or Hunts suffering.

779
01:25:25,792 --> 01:25:29,703
The old world order needs dismantling
and we have the tools to dismantle it.

780
01:25:29,727 --> 01:25:33,761
All you seem to care about is
that Hunt lives to take the blame.

781
01:25:34,304 --> 01:25:37,055
That's not anarchy.
That's revenge.

782
01:25:37,652 --> 01:25:39,154
Yes, it is.

783
01:25:39,771 --> 01:25:43,978
And when I have what I want the
Apostles are getting the plutonium.

784
01:25:48,617 --> 01:25:51,046
Hunt's the only friend you've got.
You're only alive today

785
01:25:51,070 --> 01:25:53,382
because he didn't
have the guts to kill you!

786
01:25:53,406 --> 01:25:55,844
Sloan is rights.
The <i>IMF</i> is Halloween.

787
01:25:56,344 --> 01:25:58,413
Nothing but grown men wearing...

788
01:26:05,945 --> 01:26:06,945
What?

789
01:26:12,806 --> 01:26:15,616
It's just the job.
No hard feelings.

790
01:26:20,050 --> 01:26:21,939
I've ruined your day, haven't I?

791
01:26:25,594 --> 01:26:27,928
And you were doing
so well up until then.

792
01:26:28,529 --> 01:26:30,544
And I think this one's loaded.

793
01:26:31,082 --> 01:26:32,738
You want to find out?

794
01:27:14,960 --> 01:27:17,182
So, how did I do?
- I never had any doubt.

795
01:27:19,295 --> 01:27:21,947
I'm beginning to see why
you guys enjoy this so much.

796
01:27:21,971 --> 01:27:24,751
Hands off, Mr. Secretary.
- Man's a natural.

797
01:27:25,146 --> 01:27:26,757
Welcome to the team, sir.

798
01:27:27,360 --> 01:27:28,693
You're making a mistake.

799
01:27:29,175 --> 01:27:33,099
No, the mistake was mine
when I saved your life over Paris.

800
01:27:33,761 --> 01:27:35,927
This proves nothing.
I'm playing a role.

801
01:27:36,162 --> 01:27:38,656
Just like you're. Trying
to recover that plutonium.

802
01:27:38,680 --> 01:27:42,376
That doesn't explain why you gave
Sloan the dossier and tried to frame Hunt.

803
01:27:42,400 --> 01:27:45,041
He makes a good point, Lark.

804
01:27:45,814 --> 01:27:49,972
He's paranoid. Delusional.
Just like the dossier says.

805
01:27:50,166 --> 01:27:53,277
So where did Sloan get
the dossier from? - I have no idea.

806
01:27:53,848 --> 01:27:54,848
I do.

807
01:27:58,078 --> 01:28:00,702
Did you get all
that, Erica? <i>- I did.</i>

808
01:28:01,531 --> 01:28:03,984
<i>I don't appreciate
being used, Walker.</i>

809
01:28:05,651 --> 01:28:07,473
Bad boy.

810
01:28:08,627 --> 01:28:11,570
Where would you like
him delivered? - I'll come to you.

811
01:28:14,784 --> 01:28:18,043
Nobody move!
Put them down! Drop them!

812
01:28:18,832 --> 01:28:20,862
Hands in the air!
Weapons down!

813
01:28:21,393 --> 01:28:22,955
Drop it!
Drop it!

814
01:28:23,573 --> 01:28:25,873
Weapons down! Rights now!
You! - It's Ok. - You!

815
01:28:25,897 --> 01:28:28,341
It's Ok. - I'm talking
to you! - It's all right.

816
01:28:28,534 --> 01:28:32,179
I though we had a deal?
<i>- We did and now we don't.</i>

817
01:28:33,004 --> 01:28:36,169
<i>There's too much at stake here
for me to take any chances.</i>

818
01:28:36,357 --> 01:28:39,193
I'm bringing you all in.
Along with Walker.

819
01:28:39,579 --> 01:28:41,116
The plutonium is
still out there!

820
01:28:41,140 --> 01:28:43,687
And I don't trust a living
soul in that room to get it.

821
01:28:43,711 --> 01:28:46,516
<i>We'll sort out who's
who in Washington.</i>

822
01:28:47,412 --> 01:28:48,999
Erica!
- Sir.

823
01:28:49,641 --> 01:28:52,029
It's all right. Let's
just do what she says.

824
01:28:52,957 --> 01:28:56,011
The only real threats are in
this room and we have them.

825
01:28:58,618 --> 01:28:59,617
Do you?

826
01:29:01,083 --> 01:29:02,082
Go!

827
01:29:22,216 --> 01:29:23,216
Where are they?!

828
01:29:54,184 --> 01:29:55,184
Ethan!

829
01:30:19,474 --> 01:30:21,196
First team is down.
Send backup.

830
01:30:24,797 --> 01:30:25,796
I can...

831
01:30:26,663 --> 01:30:28,493
Oh, no! Man down!

832
01:30:31,651 --> 01:30:33,104
Somebody, help!

833
01:30:42,338 --> 01:30:43,337
Sir?

834
01:30:48,056 --> 01:30:51,443
Ethan, I tagged Walker but
he's on the run. You gotta get him.

835
01:30:57,154 --> 01:30:58,154
Go.

836
01:30:59,561 --> 01:31:00,561
I'm sorry, sir.

837
01:31:02,971 --> 01:31:03,970
Go.

838
01:31:14,924 --> 01:31:15,923
Ethan.

839
01:31:20,274 --> 01:31:21,273
Wait!

840
01:31:22,884 --> 01:31:24,217
Get that son of a bitch!

841
01:31:53,346 --> 01:31:54,753
Come on! Come on!

842
01:31:55,224 --> 01:31:56,446
Yes, I got him!

843
01:32:03,203 --> 01:32:04,203
Back!

844
01:32:07,813 --> 01:32:08,813
I'm sorry.

845
01:32:09,814 --> 01:32:11,674
Talk to me, Benji.
Where's Walker?

846
01:32:12,017 --> 01:32:16,015
<i>He's about quarter mile west of you.
Turn right.</i> - Which way? To my right?

847
01:32:18,753 --> 01:32:19,752
I can't do that.

848
01:32:20,127 --> 01:32:21,126
Why not?

849
01:32:22,254 --> 01:32:25,252
Because I'm being followed.
<i>- What do you mean? By who?!</i>

850
01:32:26,181 --> 01:32:29,125
How do I know. <i>CIA</i>, Apostles,
what difference does it make?

851
01:32:29,149 --> 01:32:32,067
<i>Ok, Ok, just get out of
there and then go right.</i>

852
01:32:40,259 --> 01:32:41,703
I'm terribly sorry.

853
01:32:42,464 --> 01:32:43,463
Excuse me.

854
01:33:00,492 --> 01:33:02,047
Why's he running in circles?

855
01:33:29,068 --> 01:33:32,622
Ok, you need to cross the street
on your left as soon as you can.

856
01:33:38,064 --> 01:33:41,062
<i>Did you copy?</i> - Yeah!
<i>- Go left, now!</i> - I'm working on it!

857
01:33:52,602 --> 01:33:55,435
<i>Ok, now go across the street.
Right in front of you!</i>

858
01:34:02,091 --> 01:34:05,701
<i>Ethan, he's getting away from you.
You're gonna have to go faster!</i>

859
01:34:35,995 --> 01:34:37,883
You're gaining on him!
Go straight.

860
01:34:40,394 --> 01:34:42,061
Straight!
Keep moving straight!

861
01:34:42,582 --> 01:34:45,026
<i>Go straight.
Go straight. Straight! Straight!</i>

862
01:34:46,014 --> 01:34:47,954
<i>Ok, now turn right.</i>
- Right?

863
01:34:49,345 --> 01:34:51,832
Now?!<i>
- Yes, right!</i> - Are you sure?!

864
01:34:52,523 --> 01:34:56,585
Yes, I'm...! No it's left! Turn left!
Sorry, I had screen-lock on.

865
01:35:01,288 --> 01:35:02,287
Left?

866
01:35:06,413 --> 01:35:07,413
Thank you.

867
01:35:13,984 --> 01:35:17,001
What are you waiting for?!
- I'm jumping out of a window!

868
01:35:17,025 --> 01:35:19,413
What do you mean
you're jumping out of...?!

869
01:35:20,622 --> 01:35:23,315
Oh, sorry I had
it in 2D. Good luck!

870
01:35:58,613 --> 01:36:01,779
At the end of the bridge
turn left! You've almost got him.

871
01:36:04,894 --> 01:36:09,226
Come on, come on, come on! Come on,
Ethan! Get him! You're right on top of him!

872
01:36:23,261 --> 01:36:26,315
That's it! He's right in front
of you! Get him! Get him!

873
01:37:01,473 --> 01:37:02,861
You can't do it, can you?

874
01:37:03,420 --> 01:37:05,293
Not until you
get your plutonium.

875
01:37:05,927 --> 01:37:08,641
No, he still has plans for you.

876
01:37:10,037 --> 01:37:12,888
You're gonna turn yourself
in and admit you're John Lark.

877
01:37:12,912 --> 01:37:16,189
Then watch the old world
implode from your dark little cell.

878
01:37:16,553 --> 01:37:17,866
And if I don't?

879
01:37:31,259 --> 01:37:33,068
I'm her guardian angel, Hunt.

880
01:37:34,405 --> 01:37:36,902
If I see you again, she dies.

881
01:37:37,238 --> 01:37:39,783
If you try to warn
her, she dies.

882
01:37:40,495 --> 01:37:41,937
Know when you're beat.

883
01:38:53,300 --> 01:38:56,965
These are the designs we
recovered from Dr. Debruuks lab in Berlin.

884
01:38:56,995 --> 01:38:59,074
That's a five
mega-ton nuclear device.

885
01:38:59,466 --> 01:39:02,060
That's greater than all the
explosive energy released in <i>WW2</i>.

886
01:39:02,061 --> 01:39:04,910
To disarm it normally
we'd cut the fuse wire here.

887
01:39:05,727 --> 01:39:09,988
What? Normally? - Walker and
Lane have two plutonium cores.

888
01:39:10,583 --> 01:39:14,106
Meaning two bombs. - Yeah, and
they're both linked by microwave fail-safe

889
01:39:14,130 --> 01:39:16,196
which is accurate to
within 1/10 of a second.

890
01:39:16,220 --> 01:39:19,771
Any attempt to defuse one bomb
automatically triggers the other.

891
01:39:20,483 --> 01:39:23,395
Meaning once armed the
bombs can't be disarmed.

892
01:39:23,749 --> 01:39:27,747
The countdown is started by a
remote detonator which is also a fail-safe.

893
01:39:28,259 --> 01:39:30,290
Meaning once the
countdown starts...

894
01:39:30,988 --> 01:39:32,507
...it can't be stopped.

895
01:39:34,167 --> 01:39:36,135
So solution for this is?

896
01:39:38,849 --> 01:39:40,281
We're working on it.

897
01:39:41,996 --> 01:39:42,996
So...

898
01:39:43,691 --> 01:39:45,980
Technically this is
a suicide mission?

899
01:39:57,438 --> 01:39:58,438
What is it?

900
01:39:58,635 --> 01:40:00,731
Come and see.
Please.

901
01:40:05,026 --> 01:40:09,817
In all the years that I've known Ethan
he's only been serious about two women.

902
01:40:11,059 --> 01:40:12,697
One was his wife.

903
01:40:13,851 --> 01:40:16,815
He's married?
- No, he was.

904
01:40:17,554 --> 01:40:19,033
Was? What happened to her?

905
01:40:19,853 --> 01:40:23,300
Well, she was taken by some
people who wanted to get to Ethan.

906
01:40:24,061 --> 01:40:26,452
It's Ok. He got her
back in one piece.

907
01:40:27,424 --> 01:40:29,419
Then he quit the game.

908
01:40:29,957 --> 01:40:31,765
They were happy for a while.

909
01:40:32,622 --> 01:40:35,313
But every time something
bad happened in the world

910
01:40:35,337 --> 01:40:37,725
Ethan would think: <i>I
should have been there</i>.

911
01:40:38,324 --> 01:40:42,826
And she would wonder: <i>Who's watching
the world while Ethan is watching me?</i>

912
01:40:43,549 --> 01:40:46,533
Deep down they both knew
that someday, somehow,

913
01:40:46,558 --> 01:40:49,415
something truly terrible
was going to happen.

914
01:40:51,232 --> 01:40:53,457
All because they were together.

915
01:40:54,570 --> 01:40:55,569
So...

916
01:40:58,082 --> 01:41:01,627
Where is she now?
- She's a ghost. Good at it too.

917
01:41:02,751 --> 01:41:04,269
Taught her myself.

918
01:41:04,986 --> 01:41:08,580
Every now and then she sends up
a signal to let Ethan know she's safe.

919
01:41:08,604 --> 01:41:10,036
And that keeps him going.

920
01:41:12,191 --> 01:41:13,746
Why are you telling me this?

921
01:41:17,814 --> 01:41:20,702
We're in this mess because
Ethan wouldn't let me die.

922
01:41:23,412 --> 01:41:25,351
He's a good man.

923
01:41:25,892 --> 01:41:29,413
And he cares about you.
More than he can admit.

924
01:41:30,664 --> 01:41:33,798
That's one more worry
than he can handle right now.

925
01:41:36,880 --> 01:41:40,890
If you care about him,
you should walk away.

926
01:41:44,743 --> 01:41:45,742
If only...

927
01:41:46,068 --> 01:41:47,067
Serves me right.

928
01:42:00,014 --> 01:42:01,180
I'm coming with you.

929
01:42:10,449 --> 01:42:11,448
I know.

930
01:42:15,860 --> 01:42:17,137
So, how do we find him?

931
01:42:18,691 --> 01:42:22,880
Microwave transponder. Traceable
via satellite anywhere in the world.

932
01:42:23,506 --> 01:42:26,005
Lane had one of these
in the back of his neck.

933
01:42:26,378 --> 01:42:27,713
We removed it in Paris.

934
01:42:27,714 --> 01:42:30,442
Same time, we put our
own transponder in. - Got it!

935
01:42:33,035 --> 01:42:37,488
36 hour delayed activation. In
case Lanes Apostles scan him.

936
01:42:38,834 --> 01:42:42,604
So you planned on letting him go?
- Not this way, but yes.

937
01:42:43,389 --> 01:42:46,555
He's gonna lead us to the plutonium.
- How can you be sure?

938
01:42:46,670 --> 01:42:48,946
His plan to put me in
prison went to hell.

939
01:42:50,037 --> 01:42:52,259
Now he's gonna want
me there for the end.

940
01:42:52,918 --> 01:42:56,014
So when does this transponder activate...
- I got it! I got it! I got it!

941
01:42:56,038 --> 01:42:59,259
He's traveling east over
Europe at 500 mph. - He's airborne.

942
01:42:59,362 --> 01:43:00,811
Should we inform the <i>CIA</i>?

943
01:43:01,351 --> 01:43:04,961
<i>CIA</i> has been infiltrated.
I don't trust anybody outside this room.

944
01:43:05,615 --> 01:43:07,226
We're gonna have to go alone.

945
01:43:10,237 --> 01:43:11,486
So, where do we go?

946
01:43:31,704 --> 01:43:32,981
How're we doing, Benji?

947
01:43:33,467 --> 01:43:36,364
If there's a way to defuse
this bombs I can't find it.

948
01:43:36,388 --> 01:43:38,443
You'll figure it out.
I know you will.

949
01:43:39,992 --> 01:43:41,941
Damn! Ethan, we've
lost the signal.

950
01:43:42,823 --> 01:43:44,822
Lane must have found
our transmitter.

951
01:43:44,954 --> 01:43:47,842
What's his last position?
- About 30 miles north-east.

952
01:43:48,292 --> 01:43:50,236
Than that's where
he wants us to go.

953
01:43:50,756 --> 01:43:54,172
What's there? - The Nubra river
valley. There's only a medical camp there.

954
01:43:54,196 --> 01:43:56,042
<i>Humanitarian Aid Overseas</i>.

955
01:43:56,966 --> 01:43:59,283
Why would Lane
target a medical camp?

956
01:44:00,527 --> 01:44:01,526
Smallpox.

957
01:44:03,020 --> 01:44:06,796
What? - Smallpox. The Apostles
triggered smallpox outbreak in Kashmir.

958
01:44:06,902 --> 01:44:09,568
Lane must've wanted
that camp there for a reason.

959
01:44:09,887 --> 01:44:13,172
But what?
- Oh my God! - What is it?

960
01:44:14,429 --> 01:44:17,483
Well, the Nubra river is at
the base of Siachen glacier.

961
01:44:17,944 --> 01:44:20,047
So nuclear blast there
would irradiate the

962
01:44:20,071 --> 01:44:22,625
largest natural irrigation
system in the world.

963
01:44:23,241 --> 01:44:27,024
Fresh water from the border
of China to India and Pakistan.

964
01:44:28,474 --> 01:44:30,655
They're gonna starve one
third of the worlds population!

965
01:44:30,679 --> 01:44:32,690
The greater the suffering...

966
01:44:32,714 --> 01:44:34,560
... The greater the peace.

967
01:44:35,393 --> 01:44:38,168
I still don't understand why
Lane wants a medical camp there.

968
01:44:38,192 --> 01:44:42,383
It doesn't matter. All that matters now is
that we find a way to defuse those bombs.

969
01:44:42,407 --> 01:44:44,029
I think I've found it.

970
01:44:44,589 --> 01:44:48,261
Maybe. But there appears to a
flaw in bombs operating system.

971
01:44:48,585 --> 01:44:52,035
The remote detonator requires that
firing key. If you remove that key

972
01:44:52,059 --> 01:44:55,881
then it should short-out the
fail-safe and allow us to cut both fuses.

973
01:44:55,905 --> 01:44:58,873
So one of us needs to get the
detonator and remove that key.

974
01:44:58,897 --> 01:45:02,227
Yeah, while... - While the rest
of us cut the fuses on both bombs.

975
01:45:02,251 --> 01:45:04,407
Simple.
- Yeah, but...

976
01:45:05,100 --> 01:45:06,100
But what?

977
01:45:06,335 --> 01:45:09,765
Well in order to make this
work we can't remove the key

978
01:45:09,790 --> 01:45:12,913
or cut the fuses until
after the countdown starts.

979
01:45:14,446 --> 01:45:17,563
Wait, wait! Just so I got this clear.
Our only chance to safely defuse

980
01:45:17,587 --> 01:45:20,647
both bombs is to let
the countdown start?

981
01:45:21,581 --> 01:45:23,890
And then remove that key.

982
01:45:32,757 --> 01:45:33,757
Ok.

983
01:45:51,773 --> 01:45:54,484
Both devices are now
connected to the detonator.

984
01:45:56,178 --> 01:46:00,010
15 minutes should give you enough
time to reach minimum safe distance.

985
01:46:02,616 --> 01:46:04,471
My running days are over.

986
01:46:05,786 --> 01:46:07,499
This is where it ends for me.

987
01:46:36,919 --> 01:46:38,959
I'm getting signals
all over the place.

988
01:46:38,983 --> 01:46:41,117
That's why the medical
camp. X-ray machines,

989
01:46:41,141 --> 01:46:43,946
CAT-scanners, radiological
signatures everywhere.

990
01:46:44,198 --> 01:46:46,504
Looks like a needle in a haystack.
- Process of elimination.

991
01:46:46,528 --> 01:46:49,420
One at a time. Let's
split up. Stay on comms.

992
01:46:59,770 --> 01:47:00,769
Ethan?

993
01:47:06,724 --> 01:47:07,724
Julia?

994
01:47:12,730 --> 01:47:13,730
Is that?

995
01:47:18,074 --> 01:47:19,074
Julia!

996
01:47:21,030 --> 01:47:22,029
Does he know?

997
01:47:23,938 --> 01:47:26,664
Hey.
- This is my husband, Eric.

998
01:47:27,515 --> 01:47:30,275
This is...
- Rob, Rob Thorn. Dr. Rob Thorn.

999
01:47:31,006 --> 01:47:34,432
I worked with Julia at...
- Mass General, before New York.

1000
01:47:34,914 --> 01:47:39,440
Oh, you're kidding? What a coincidence?
- I know. I... - What brings you all this way?

1001
01:47:39,464 --> 01:47:41,741
I was in Turtuk,
not far from here.

1002
01:47:42,360 --> 01:47:44,631
And heard help is needed.

1003
01:47:45,210 --> 01:47:48,001
Oh, well... Actually we're
just about finished here.

1004
01:47:48,025 --> 01:47:50,697
The whole village
is inoculated but...

1005
01:47:51,494 --> 01:47:53,160
What were you doing at Turtuk?

1006
01:47:53,810 --> 01:47:55,243
Rob's on vacation.

1007
01:47:55,725 --> 01:47:58,103
No... No, I'm working.

1008
01:48:00,618 --> 01:48:02,173
You're a long way from home.

1009
01:48:02,690 --> 01:48:05,081
Yeah, yeah. Thanks
to our guardian angel.

1010
01:48:05,555 --> 01:48:06,554
Guardian?

1011
01:48:06,620 --> 01:48:09,206
Well, yeah. We were running a
field hospital outside of Darfur

1012
01:48:09,230 --> 01:48:10,771
when outbreak happened here.

1013
01:48:10,795 --> 01:48:14,047
Here comes this phone call from an
anonymous donor. Out of the blue.

1014
01:48:14,071 --> 01:48:18,181
And he says he's ready to underwrite
the entire operation. One condition...

1015
01:48:18,879 --> 01:48:20,754
We run the whole thing.

1016
01:48:21,273 --> 01:48:22,551
Can you believe that?

1017
01:48:23,463 --> 01:48:24,598
I certainly can.

1018
01:48:26,176 --> 01:48:28,051
Out of the blue.
- Out of the blue.

1019
01:48:31,012 --> 01:48:34,936
It's quite a full life. - Yeah, you
know before Julia I never traveled.

1020
01:48:35,323 --> 01:48:36,676
<i>I never even left New York.</i>

1021
01:48:36,700 --> 01:48:40,394
<i>Never left the hospital. 7 days
a week, overtime, no vacations.</i>

1022
01:48:40,881 --> 01:48:42,714
Ethan, I think I
found something.

1023
01:48:42,780 --> 01:48:46,236
<i>I was just patient checking. You keep
the circuit at 50. Heart attack at 55.</i>

1024
01:48:46,260 --> 01:48:48,772
And she convinced me
to let it all go.

1025
01:48:49,649 --> 01:48:53,147
Help where it's needed most. So
we've been on the go ever since.

1026
01:48:53,734 --> 01:48:55,457
I've never been more fulfilled.

1027
01:48:56,985 --> 01:48:58,343
I'm happy for you.

1028
01:48:59,700 --> 01:49:00,699
<i>Right there.</i>

1029
01:49:02,744 --> 01:49:05,909
Well, we should get going.
We have a lot of packing to do.

1030
01:49:06,316 --> 01:49:08,195
Oh, no. I'll handle that.
You two should catch up.

1031
01:49:08,219 --> 01:49:09,912
Oh no, I should
get out of your hair.

1032
01:49:09,936 --> 01:49:12,185
Are you kidding?
You should stick around.

1033
01:49:12,210 --> 01:49:14,876
I'm just sorry you came
all this way for nothing.

1034
01:49:16,434 --> 01:49:20,907
I'll tell you what. We'll pack and why
don't we give you a ride back to Turtuk.

1035
01:49:21,063 --> 01:49:22,344
You two can catch up in the car.

1036
01:49:23,018 --> 01:49:24,017
Yeah?

1037
01:49:24,280 --> 01:49:25,303
You're very kind.

1038
01:49:26,535 --> 01:49:29,077
Settled.
See you soon.

1039
01:49:30,818 --> 01:49:32,060
It was good to see you.

1040
01:49:33,334 --> 01:49:36,266
I'm so sorry, Julia.
I'm so sorry.

1041
01:49:57,765 --> 01:49:59,220
Take those helicopters.

1042
01:50:00,519 --> 01:50:02,261
No one else leaves.

1043
01:50:10,632 --> 01:50:12,222
Careful, careful, careful.

1044
01:50:16,877 --> 01:50:19,296
It's armed but the
countdown hasn't started yet.

1045
01:50:19,320 --> 01:50:21,843
The network signal's strong which
means the other device is close by.

1046
01:50:21,867 --> 01:50:24,605
And the detonator.
By half km in that direction.

1047
01:50:26,593 --> 01:50:27,865
They're still here.

1048
01:50:29,251 --> 01:50:31,317
Luther, you keep working
on it. You two, come with me!

1049
01:50:33,356 --> 01:50:35,356
Oh, sure. I've got this.

1050
01:50:36,084 --> 01:50:37,721
Don't worry about old Luther.

1051
01:51:01,478 --> 01:51:03,278
<i>SCANNING</i>

1052
01:51:12,094 --> 01:51:13,094
Walker.

1053
01:51:14,191 --> 01:51:17,057
<i>LINKED
ARMED</i>

1054
01:51:18,658 --> 01:51:22,172
Damn! Ethan, the countdown has
started! We <i>have 15 minutes!</i>

1055
01:51:22,676 --> 01:51:24,064
Walker has the detonator!

1056
01:51:34,985 --> 01:51:35,984
Come on!

1057
01:51:37,691 --> 01:51:40,099
We have to evacuate
this people! - There's no time!

1058
01:51:40,123 --> 01:51:42,870
This whole valley is gonna
be incinerated in 15 minutes!

1059
01:51:46,825 --> 01:51:48,660
It's too late!
- No.

1060
01:51:49,477 --> 01:51:51,730
I'm gonna get the detonator!
- What? How?!

1061
01:51:51,933 --> 01:51:53,154
I'll figure it out!

1062
01:51:53,914 --> 01:51:55,808
You find Lane and
find the other bomb!

1063
01:51:57,202 --> 01:51:59,398
What to hell is he doing?!
- I find it's best not to look.

1064
01:52:35,202 --> 01:52:38,410
How're we doing, Luther? - Tripwires
everywhere. I don't have enough hands.

1065
01:52:38,445 --> 01:52:41,432
<i>Just make it out!</i> - Where's Ethan?
- He's gone after the detonator.

1066
01:52:41,950 --> 01:52:43,558
<i>Wait! Where's the detonator?</i>

1067
01:53:21,618 --> 01:53:22,618
Luther.

1068
01:53:23,377 --> 01:53:24,377
Julia.

1069
01:53:24,512 --> 01:53:26,253
<i>You shouldn't be here.</i>
- Oh my God!

1070
01:53:27,058 --> 01:53:28,604
Oh my God!

1071
01:53:29,052 --> 01:53:31,267
Is that what I think it is?
<i>- Luther, get her out of there!</i>

1072
01:53:31,858 --> 01:53:33,146
Where's she gonna go?

1073
01:53:34,519 --> 01:53:36,375
All right.
What can I do?

1074
01:53:38,892 --> 01:53:41,692
In the kit. The pliers with
the red grip. <i>- Are you insane?!</i>

1075
01:53:42,105 --> 01:53:44,896
Mind your business, Benji!
- This is my business!

1076
01:55:28,337 --> 01:55:29,781
<i>Benji, do you copy?</i>
- Ethan?

1077
01:55:30,475 --> 01:55:33,502
Ethan, where are you?
- I'm in a helicopter going after Walker.

1078
01:55:33,756 --> 01:55:35,740
<i>Hold on!</i>
How did you get in the helicopter?

1079
01:55:35,810 --> 01:55:38,427
What? You can fly a helicopter?!
- Did you say helicopter?

1080
01:55:38,477 --> 01:55:40,293
What the hell are you
doing in a helicopter?

1081
01:55:40,328 --> 01:55:43,523
<i>Did you...?</i> Hey, did you
find the other bomb?

1082
01:55:43,569 --> 01:55:45,384
<i>Well, we're still looking</i>
but finding the bomb

1083
01:55:45,408 --> 01:55:47,183
isn't gonna matter unless
we have the detonator.

1084
01:55:47,299 --> 01:55:49,446
I know, I know.
I'll get it. I'll get it!

1085
01:55:49,828 --> 01:55:51,540
<i>If he's in another
helicopter...</i>

1086
01:55:52,373 --> 01:55:54,372
...how're you gonna get it?
<i>- I'll figure it out.</i>

1087
01:55:54,513 --> 01:55:57,373
You find the bomb. I'll get
the detonator. I won't let you down.

1088
01:55:59,491 --> 01:56:00,657
I won't let you down.

1089
01:56:01,210 --> 01:56:05,704
<i>Be ready.</i> - Look, Ethan.
Ethan! Ethan, come in!

1090
01:56:06,079 --> 01:56:08,416
Benji!<i>
- Come in!</i> - Benji! Luther!

1091
01:56:09,174 --> 01:56:10,034
Anybody?

1092
01:56:11,946 --> 01:56:13,497
I can do this.
I can do this!

1093
01:56:14,128 --> 01:56:16,070
What do we got here?
We got airspeed.

1094
01:56:17,082 --> 01:56:20,499
Airspeed. Ok, power.
This is power.

1095
01:56:27,327 --> 01:56:29,512
Payload! How do I
get rid of this payload?

1096
01:56:32,027 --> 01:56:33,026
<i>PAYLOAD</i>

1097
01:56:38,826 --> 01:56:40,003
Power!

1098
01:56:54,545 --> 01:56:57,219
Wire stripper. - I'm a doctor,
not an electrician. - Sorry.

1099
01:56:57,254 --> 01:56:59,073
The thing with
a green grip.

1100
01:56:59,634 --> 01:57:02,150
Got it. - The wire in my
left hand. - The black one?

1101
01:57:02,174 --> 01:57:05,501
My left hand. - That's your
left hand. - Sorry, the other wire!

1102
01:57:05,872 --> 01:57:08,948
The red one? - Yes, the red one
in my right hand. - Just checking.

1103
01:57:09,879 --> 01:57:11,231
I like her.

1104
01:57:24,755 --> 01:57:26,305
Hold this for me, will you?

1105
01:57:28,528 --> 01:57:29,528
Holly shit!

1106
01:57:33,906 --> 01:57:35,497
Dammit!

1107
01:57:36,041 --> 01:57:37,581
Get up there!

1108
01:57:45,923 --> 01:57:47,537
That's right.

1109
01:57:47,736 --> 01:57:49,277
Prick!

1110
01:57:58,409 --> 01:57:59,409
Shit!

1111
01:58:05,551 --> 01:58:07,221
Son of a bitch!

1112
01:58:09,833 --> 01:58:10,832
Got it!

1113
01:58:19,632 --> 01:58:21,558
Do it!
Do it!

1114
01:58:22,130 --> 01:58:23,526
Shit!

1115
01:58:23,561 --> 01:58:26,364
<i>Pull up!
Pull up!</i>

1116
01:58:26,522 --> 01:58:31,497
<i>Delaying! Delaying!
Pull up! Pull up!</i>

1117
01:58:31,532 --> 01:58:34,666
I'm trying, I'm trying!
- <i>Delaying! Delaying!</i>

1118
01:58:52,092 --> 01:58:55,121
I can not find anything. I think
we're looking in the wrong place.

1119
01:58:55,819 --> 01:58:58,578
Signature's everywhere. This
is the perfect place to hide it.

1120
01:58:58,602 --> 01:58:59,962
That's the point.
I know Lane.

1121
01:58:59,986 --> 01:59:01,320
If we're looking here...

1122
01:59:02,361 --> 01:59:04,086
It's because he wants us to.

1123
01:59:07,201 --> 01:59:10,033
I'm heading to village.
- Just wait for me. Alright?

1124
01:59:13,754 --> 01:59:15,724
Ilsa, I think I found something.

1125
01:59:19,649 --> 01:59:21,851
Cut this wire, right here.

1126
01:59:22,998 --> 01:59:27,496
Turn that screw
counterclockwise very slowly.

1127
01:59:30,149 --> 01:59:31,149
So...

1128
01:59:33,289 --> 01:59:34,288
How's he?

1129
01:59:34,384 --> 01:59:37,141
Well, you know.
Same old Ethan.

1130
01:59:46,993 --> 01:59:47,992
Jesus!

1131
01:59:51,785 --> 01:59:52,785
Shit!

1132
01:59:53,013 --> 01:59:54,620
No, no, no!

1133
02:00:03,186 --> 02:00:04,403
Benji, I see Lane now.

1134
02:00:04,427 --> 02:00:07,323
What?! Where? - He's in a
house at the enter to the village.

1135
02:00:07,347 --> 02:00:08,716
Alright. Just wait for me. Ok?

1136
02:00:09,648 --> 02:00:10,719
<i>Ilsa, wait for me!</i>

1137
02:00:21,176 --> 02:00:22,175
No!

1138
02:00:27,716 --> 02:00:28,716
Nuclear bomb.

1139
02:00:40,020 --> 02:00:41,020
Dammit!

1140
02:01:24,230 --> 02:01:25,896
Benji, I found the other bomb.

1141
02:01:26,539 --> 02:01:28,705
Ilsa, where are you?!
- I'm in a house...

1142
02:01:51,978 --> 02:01:53,811
Hey! What the hell
are you doing?!

1143
02:01:54,147 --> 02:01:57,325
You're out of your mind!
I don't know what's down there!

1144
02:02:01,649 --> 02:02:02,789
Pull up!
Pull up!

1145
02:02:12,989 --> 02:02:16,418
This crazy son of a bitch
is trying to ram us! Go!

1146
02:02:33,985 --> 02:02:34,985
Yes!

1147
02:02:35,601 --> 02:02:39,933
Benji, come in. We're almost at the fuse.
We need to find that other bomb, now!

1148
02:02:41,348 --> 02:02:44,190
Did you say other bomb?
<i>- Benji, do you read me?</i>

1149
02:02:44,603 --> 02:02:45,772
I'm working on it!

1150
02:02:46,406 --> 02:02:47,886
Ilsa, where are you?!

1151
02:03:06,165 --> 02:03:11,605
He can't stop it. Understand?
There's nothing he can do.

1152
02:03:11,640 --> 02:03:14,733
When the clock runs out
Ethan Hunt will loose everything...

1153
02:03:15,874 --> 02:03:17,274
And everyone...

1154
02:03:18,572 --> 02:03:20,352
...he ever cared about.

1155
02:03:22,008 --> 02:03:23,809
<i>Ilsa, Ilsa!</i>
- Benji!

1156
02:03:24,588 --> 02:03:26,652
Benji!<i>
- Ilsa, where are you?!</i>

1157
02:03:28,448 --> 02:03:30,072
You don't want to see this.

1158
02:03:32,065 --> 02:03:33,064
Benji!

1159
02:03:33,677 --> 02:03:34,677
<i>Ilsa?</i>
- Benji!

1160
02:03:35,250 --> 02:03:36,725
Benji, release me!

1161
02:03:37,384 --> 02:03:38,524
No, no!

1162
02:04:06,739 --> 02:04:07,738
Benji!

1163
02:04:32,628 --> 02:04:35,123
No, no, no!

1164
02:05:14,617 --> 02:05:16,061
Stay with me!
Stay with me!

1165
02:05:19,303 --> 02:05:22,533
No! Not when I'm this close. Not
when I'm this close! Come on! Come on!

1166
02:05:24,280 --> 02:05:25,279
Yes!

1167
02:07:09,307 --> 02:07:10,207
Thank you.

1168
02:07:10,255 --> 02:07:11,254
Tie him up.

1169
02:08:15,245 --> 02:08:17,582
Why won't you just die?

1170
02:08:39,738 --> 02:08:41,515
There's nothing
else you can do.

1171
02:08:43,127 --> 02:08:44,583
Go be with your husband.

1172
02:08:46,279 --> 02:08:47,279
Luther...

1173
02:08:48,138 --> 02:08:49,138
Go.

1174
02:09:02,851 --> 02:09:04,017
Benji, where are you?

1175
02:09:04,206 --> 02:09:05,706
Ok, Luther, we're inside.
Tell us what to do.

1176
02:09:05,830 --> 02:09:08,473
<i>You should keep the red wire
attached to the motherboard.</i> - Yeah.

1177
02:09:08,497 --> 02:09:12,188
You need to cut that and the green
wire next to it simultaneously.

1178
02:09:13,462 --> 02:09:15,697
Ok. Ready?
Set? Cut.

1179
02:09:18,114 --> 02:09:22,158
I told you it can't be stopped.
There's nothing you can do.

1180
02:12:40,443 --> 02:12:43,914
<i>Benji, listen.</i> Turn
the screw counterclockwise. - Yup.

1181
02:12:45,707 --> 02:12:50,205
<i>Remove that panel and you'll see the power
and ground wires for the fuse.</i> - Got it.

1182
02:12:50,305 --> 02:12:55,142
When the time comes cut the green wire.
<i>Do not cut it yet!</i> - Ok, we copy.

1183
02:13:00,783 --> 02:13:03,781
Ethan, if you can hear me,
we're ready to make the cut.

1184
02:13:04,067 --> 02:13:05,067
Ethan, come in!

1185
02:13:05,630 --> 02:13:08,290
Benji, how do we
know if he's got the key?

1186
02:13:08,884 --> 02:13:12,465
<i>He'll get it.</i> - Yeah, but
how do we know? - He'll get it done!

1187
02:13:18,991 --> 02:13:20,736
We're out of time! We just
have to hope he has it!

1188
02:13:20,760 --> 02:13:22,759
Ok. We're ready.
<i>- Two seconds we cut!</i>

1189
02:13:22,916 --> 02:13:25,716
Wait, wait! Why two? Why not one?
- You want to cut it that close?

1190
02:13:25,740 --> 02:13:27,303
Well, it's the second
we'll never get back!

1191
02:13:27,327 --> 02:13:29,959
Wait! Can we make a decision on this?!
- Alright! We'll do it on one!

1192
02:13:29,983 --> 02:13:32,383
Cutting on one?
- Yes, one! Alright, stand by.

1193
02:13:35,060 --> 02:13:38,659
3, 2, 1, now!

1194
02:14:17,553 --> 02:14:18,553
Ok.

1195
02:14:30,036 --> 02:14:31,035
My man.

1196
02:15:24,713 --> 02:15:25,712
Ethan?

1197
02:15:29,664 --> 02:15:30,664
Can you hear me?

1198
02:15:34,747 --> 02:15:36,213
No, don't, don't.

1199
02:15:37,190 --> 02:15:38,190
Don't try to move.

1200
02:15:38,921 --> 02:15:39,921
Don't move.

1201
02:15:39,983 --> 02:15:41,316
You're pretty banged up.

1202
02:15:44,629 --> 02:15:45,684
You're a lucky man.

1203
02:15:45,911 --> 02:15:48,743
It's a miracle that crash
didn't kill you Dr. Thorn.

1204
02:15:48,874 --> 02:15:52,049
If your friend didn't find you an hour
later you would've died from exposure.

1205
02:15:52,073 --> 02:15:53,783
My friend?
- Yeah.

1206
02:15:56,561 --> 02:15:58,560
She got here not
long after you left.

1207
02:15:59,203 --> 02:16:01,314
Right in front of
half the Indian army.

1208
02:16:02,252 --> 02:16:04,585
Can you give us just a
few minutes, please?

1209
02:16:06,606 --> 02:16:08,471
See you later, doc.

1210
02:16:15,195 --> 02:16:16,195
Julia,

1211
02:16:17,856 --> 02:16:18,855
I'm sorry.

1212
02:16:19,832 --> 02:16:22,121
There's no reason
to be sorry. - No.

1213
02:16:22,722 --> 02:16:23,722
I'm sorry...

1214
02:16:25,493 --> 02:16:26,715
...for everything.
I...

1215
02:16:29,163 --> 02:16:30,163
Look at me.

1216
02:16:31,473 --> 02:16:32,473
Look at me.

1217
02:16:33,124 --> 02:16:34,932
Look at my life.

1218
02:16:36,336 --> 02:16:41,531
I love what I do and I never
would've found this if I hadn't met you.

1219
02:16:42,796 --> 02:16:44,982
Everything that happened...

1220
02:16:45,737 --> 02:16:51,439
...though me a way and
showed me what I'm capable of and I...

1221
02:16:51,832 --> 02:16:53,844
I'm a survivor.

1222
02:16:54,637 --> 02:16:56,707
But what happened here...

1223
02:16:57,367 --> 02:17:00,812
It was my...
- Nothing happened. Because you were here.

1224
02:17:03,507 --> 02:17:07,673
And I sleep soundly at night
knowing you always will be.

1225
02:17:16,277 --> 02:17:17,276
You're happy?

1226
02:17:17,715 --> 02:17:18,714
Very.

1227
02:17:22,365 --> 02:17:24,552
I'm exactly where I should be.

1228
02:17:26,878 --> 02:17:29,234
And so are you.

1229
02:18:08,003 --> 02:18:09,326
Per your request.

1230
02:18:10,768 --> 02:18:13,866
I'm handing Solomon
Lane back to <i>MI6</i>.

1231
02:18:18,843 --> 02:18:20,929
Trough a broker, of course.

1232
02:18:23,165 --> 02:18:25,665
Part of our
ongoing arrangement.

1233
02:18:31,183 --> 02:18:32,814
After what happened in Paris

1234
02:18:33,755 --> 02:18:36,302
we prefer to keep a low profile.

1235
02:18:38,704 --> 02:18:43,481
And that closes your friends
account with British intelligence.

1236
02:18:44,986 --> 02:18:47,354
The ribs. Watch the ribs.

1237
02:18:47,922 --> 02:18:50,870
I understand now why
Hunley believed in you.

1238
02:18:51,685 --> 02:18:54,159
The world needs the <i>IMF</i>.

1239
02:18:54,827 --> 02:18:56,809
We need people like you.

1240
02:18:57,109 --> 02:18:59,142
Who care about the one life

1241
02:18:59,978 --> 02:19:03,018
as much as they
care about the millions.

1242
02:19:04,668 --> 02:19:07,722
That way I never have to.

1243
02:19:08,875 --> 02:19:09,875
You're Ok?

1244
02:19:11,217 --> 02:19:13,055
You've never looked
better. - Don’t!

1245
02:19:16,009 --> 02:19:17,702
How close were we?

1246
02:19:20,439 --> 02:19:21,439
The usual.

1247
02:19:26,021 --> 02:19:27,020
Usual?

1248
02:19:29,062 --> 02:19:30,892
Please, don't make me laugh.
