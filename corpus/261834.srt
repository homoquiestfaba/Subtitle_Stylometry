1
00:03:20,333 --> 00:03:24,736
File this under amazing stories, my friends.

2
00:03:27,173 --> 00:03:30,472
It seems that
the National Organization for Women...

3
00:03:30,543 --> 00:03:35,139
...otherwise known as NOW,
otherwise known as lesbians fond of plaid...

4
00:03:35,215 --> 00:03:39,982
...have chosen, once again,
to take issue with yours truly.

5
00:03:40,687 --> 00:03:43,656
These angry feminists...

6
00:03:43,723 --> 00:03:48,592
...and I say angry feminists
like there's some other kind....

7
00:03:50,563 --> 00:03:53,498
-Should we help her? We should.
-So start helping her.

8
00:03:53,566 --> 00:03:56,729
-You don't need us to help her.
-Why don't you?

9
00:03:56,836 --> 00:04:00,829
-Why don't I carry your slippers in my mouth?
-That's an answer?

10
00:04:00,907 --> 00:04:03,876
You don't help her, you don't help us.
You're a big cow.

11
00:04:03,943 --> 00:04:07,572
We'll have the appetizers
while we wait for Pete and what's her name.

12
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:10,376
I didn't have tomatoes for salsa
so we'll dip in hummus.

13
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:12,247
-Sorry.
-I don't care.

14
00:04:12,452 --> 00:04:15,512
What we need in this country,
my friends, is leadership.

15
00:04:15,588 --> 00:04:17,920
Someone who can stand up to the liberals.

16
00:04:18,024 --> 00:04:23,223
We need a return, God darn it,
of the promise of the Reagan-Bush years.

17
00:04:23,696 --> 00:04:26,392
A time of unequalled growth in this county.

18
00:04:26,466 --> 00:04:27,763
We need Norman!

19
00:04:27,867 --> 00:04:31,234
Well, careful folks, you just might get me.

20
00:04:31,771 --> 00:04:34,968
Please. Can we get this idiot
out of our living room?

21
00:04:35,074 --> 00:04:36,200
Who, Norman?

22
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:38,642
-He's a moron!
-Honey, he's a genius.

23
00:04:38,945 --> 00:04:42,938
He can take any issue, no matter how trivial,
and create a national debate.

24
00:04:43,049 --> 00:04:45,779
-He tells lies better than most tell the truth.
-Please.

25
00:04:45,885 --> 00:04:48,319
It's good to keep track
of what the enemy is doing.

26
00:04:48,421 --> 00:04:53,290
A storm is brewing, my friends.
Someone has to stop it.

27
00:04:53,893 --> 00:04:55,827
Well, it's my TV.

28
00:04:58,064 --> 00:05:00,430
That was truly puerile.

29
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:06,897
-Okay, so who's Pete bringing?
-Jenny Tyler.

30
00:05:06,973 --> 00:05:08,270
Not funny.

31
00:05:08,341 --> 00:05:12,573
-The kidnapped girl, that's funny.
-It's very funny, it's just tasteless.

32
00:05:13,446 --> 00:05:14,674
That's them.

33
00:05:18,017 --> 00:05:20,815
Is it me, or does someone need
to get laid more often?

34
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:21,944
Yeah, me.

35
00:05:22,021 --> 00:05:23,852
-I'm available.
-Talk to her.

36
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:29,352
What happened?

37
00:05:29,462 --> 00:05:32,898
Don't ask. Cindy stood me up again.
Then my fucking Benz....

38
00:05:32,965 --> 00:05:35,456
-No guest?
-Not exactly.

39
00:05:35,535 --> 00:05:39,528
Zack? Zack, this is Marc.
Marc, this is Zack.

40
00:05:39,806 --> 00:05:41,171
How are you doing?

41
00:05:41,274 --> 00:05:44,869
Zack picked me up in his truck.
What was wrong with my Mercedes again?

42
00:05:44,977 --> 00:05:46,342
Cracked manifold.

43
00:05:46,446 --> 00:05:47,606
No shit?

44
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:50,706
I said, "Can l?" My wallet....

45
00:05:50,817 --> 00:05:52,785
-What do you need?
-A two.

46
00:05:53,619 --> 00:05:55,849
That's good. Thank you, Zack.

47
00:05:56,122 --> 00:05:59,819
Thanks, I don't usually take charity.
I'll be seeing you guys.

48
00:05:59,892 --> 00:06:02,486
No, no, wait. Stay for dinner.

49
00:06:02,562 --> 00:06:06,157
Why don't you stay? We're expecting
a guest anyway, we got a place set.

50
00:06:06,232 --> 00:06:09,861
-I don't want to be any trouble.
-No. Please, it's horrible out.

51
00:06:09,969 --> 00:06:12,665
-You helped us out, so please.
-Come on. All right?

52
00:06:12,739 --> 00:06:14,400
What are you having?

53
00:06:14,507 --> 00:06:15,804
Lasagne.

54
00:06:16,175 --> 00:06:17,301
Yeah?

55
00:06:18,511 --> 00:06:20,138
-I can eat that.
-Cool.

56
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:10,126
-Pete, why not get a new car?
-But I love my car.

57
00:07:10,229 --> 00:07:13,198
Maybe your folks can give you
another hand-me-down Mercedes.

58
00:07:13,266 --> 00:07:15,063
No, it would have to be a new car.

59
00:07:15,134 --> 00:07:17,762
Twitchy was looking for you in the quad today.

60
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:18,894
-No.
-Yes, way.

61
00:07:18,971 --> 00:07:20,097
No.

62
00:07:20,206 --> 00:07:22,902
He had that big booty butt.

63
00:07:23,109 --> 00:07:24,906
No, he was looking for me?

64
00:07:24,977 --> 00:07:29,311
Excuse me, aren't you all forgetting something?

65
00:07:29,415 --> 00:07:32,816
We eat our salad after the main course,
European-style.

66
00:07:32,919 --> 00:07:35,581
-No, I mean grace.
-We don't say grace.

67
00:07:35,655 --> 00:07:40,615
You don't want to thank somebody
for putting this nice food on your table?

68
00:08:01,914 --> 00:08:04,144
I hope you put in a good word
for us heathens.

69
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:06,946
Oh, I did, but I don't think he heard.

70
00:08:09,956 --> 00:08:12,618
So, Zack, do you live around here?

71
00:08:13,259 --> 00:08:15,853
Why do you want to know where I live?

72
00:08:16,596 --> 00:08:20,430
Just making conversation.
You see, every Sunday for about a year...

73
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:24,027
...we've been inviting a guest
over for dinner and discussion.

74
00:08:25,271 --> 00:08:26,932
What do you talk about?

75
00:08:27,306 --> 00:08:30,275
Everything. Life. Current events.

76
00:08:30,343 --> 00:08:32,607
-The environment.
-The law.

77
00:08:33,112 --> 00:08:37,640
I don't live anywhere around here.
I drive a truck.

78
00:08:37,717 --> 00:08:42,347
Zack was telling me on the way over here
that he's actually driven through...

79
00:08:42,455 --> 00:08:45,618
...all 48 conterminous states.

80
00:08:45,691 --> 00:08:46,953
Fascinating.

81
00:08:47,126 --> 00:08:51,392
So, you all college students or something?

82
00:08:51,564 --> 00:08:54,055
-We're grad students.
-What's that?

83
00:08:54,233 --> 00:08:58,636
It means we've graduated.
We're earning our Master's degrees.

84
00:08:59,872 --> 00:09:01,863
I'm going to be a master painter.

85
00:09:01,974 --> 00:09:04,306
-Master lawyer.
-Masturbator.

86
00:09:06,245 --> 00:09:08,372
Just plain master.

87
00:09:12,485 --> 00:09:14,578
I'm studying social work.

88
00:09:15,087 --> 00:09:19,319
Jude is actually continuing studies in....
What is it this week?

89
00:09:19,392 --> 00:09:21,656
Psychology. Thank you.

90
00:09:23,563 --> 00:09:25,656
You paint those pictures there?

91
00:09:26,732 --> 00:09:28,893
Marc wants to be a time traveller.

92
00:09:29,435 --> 00:09:31,027
Time traveller?

93
00:09:31,504 --> 00:09:34,098
You know,
go back in time to change history.

94
00:09:34,206 --> 00:09:39,576
What if the Confederacy had a liquid metal guy?
Or what if Eisenhower was a girl?

95
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:42,875
And what do you do again?

96
00:09:43,015 --> 00:09:46,883
Don't you know?
I am a professional basketball player.

97
00:09:48,688 --> 00:09:51,122
-Are you making fun of me?
-No.

98
00:09:52,358 --> 00:09:56,852
I'm getting my Ph.D. in political science.
That means I'm going to be a doctor.

99
00:09:58,864 --> 00:10:00,798
Have you always driven a truck?

100
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:04,427
No, I was in the Marines.

101
00:10:05,571 --> 00:10:07,232
I was in the war.

102
00:10:07,873 --> 00:10:10,398
War? What war?

103
00:10:11,310 --> 00:10:12,607
Desert Storm.

104
00:10:12,979 --> 00:10:14,606
Was that really a war?

105
00:10:15,047 --> 00:10:18,312
I just thought that was
a Republican commercial campaign.

106
00:10:19,952 --> 00:10:22,318
You got a problem with patriotism?

107
00:10:22,421 --> 00:10:24,150
As a concept? No.

108
00:10:24,657 --> 00:10:28,252
I love my country,
and I will fight anyone who says different.

109
00:10:28,327 --> 00:10:30,921
"Who was Joey Gerbils, 1933?"

110
00:10:31,430 --> 00:10:35,127
But wait. Seriously, I don't think
the Germans were actually patriotic.

111
00:10:35,234 --> 00:10:37,964
I think it was a hysterical wave of nationalism.

112
00:10:38,070 --> 00:10:40,834
-Patriotism leads to nationalism.
-No, not true.

113
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:45,468
Wait. Which one had the designated-hitter rule?

114
00:10:45,578 --> 00:10:47,512
-The American League.
-Just wanted to know.

115
00:10:47,613 --> 00:10:49,581
Hitler had the right idea.

116
00:10:51,684 --> 00:10:53,083
Excuse me?

117
00:10:53,352 --> 00:10:56,253
That was an extraordinary statement, Zack.

118
00:10:56,322 --> 00:10:58,347
I'm not saying that killing Jews was right.

119
00:10:58,457 --> 00:11:02,917
If he really did.
There's no real proof, you know.

120
00:11:03,362 --> 00:11:05,626
He killed six million Jews.

121
00:11:05,798 --> 00:11:08,266
And millions of Gypsies and Catholics.

122
00:11:08,434 --> 00:11:10,129
All numbers, really.

123
00:11:10,469 --> 00:11:12,937
Nobody can prove it. Funny, ain't it?

124
00:11:13,272 --> 00:11:16,935
When it comes to buying shit,
the Jews always bring the numbers down.

125
00:11:17,009 --> 00:11:20,501
"$2,000 for this old car?
I'll give you $1,200, tops."

126
00:11:20,613 --> 00:11:23,844
When it comes to WWll,
they're always pushing the numbers up.

127
00:11:23,949 --> 00:11:27,282
First it's six million, then it's seven million.

128
00:11:27,687 --> 00:11:30,850
-Why don't we change the subject?
-Yeah, do you like the lasagne?

129
00:11:30,956 --> 00:11:33,447
No, I want to hear this. Wait a minute.

130
00:11:33,526 --> 00:11:36,689
What do you think,
in your vastly finite wisdom...

131
00:11:37,329 --> 00:11:40,560
...that Hitler had the right idea about?

132
00:11:42,068 --> 00:11:44,730
It's common knowledge that the Jews,
no offence...

133
00:11:44,837 --> 00:11:47,704
...were stealing from the Germans,
like they do here.

134
00:11:47,807 --> 00:11:48,967
Really?

135
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:51,009
Yeah, it's a fact.

136
00:11:51,410 --> 00:11:55,244
-First of all, the Jews were Germans.
-Come on, Jews ain't like that.

137
00:11:55,347 --> 00:11:59,875
No, Jews ain't like that.
It's always being a Jew first.

138
00:12:01,187 --> 00:12:03,018
That's why everybody hates them.

139
00:12:03,089 --> 00:12:05,319
Everybody does not hate the Jews.

140
00:12:05,391 --> 00:12:07,882
You're thinking about people who can read.

141
00:12:09,395 --> 00:12:12,762
Marc, you're a Jew, right?

142
00:12:13,199 --> 00:12:15,224
-Right.
-All right.

143
00:12:16,001 --> 00:12:20,904
If the U.S. was to go to war against lsrael,
who would you fight for?

144
00:12:21,574 --> 00:12:25,408
Well, I guess that would be the side
that paid me the most.

145
00:12:26,412 --> 00:12:29,848
How about you, Luke?
If the U.S. was to fight Africa?

146
00:12:29,915 --> 00:12:31,576
Africa is a continent, Zack.

147
00:12:31,684 --> 00:12:34,778
Yeah, I know that.
Which side would you take?

148
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:40,552
What if the U.S. went to war
against the Louisiana swamp you come from?

149
00:12:40,926 --> 00:12:42,587
How's that for heavy?

150
00:12:42,695 --> 00:12:46,187
Calling people names, that ain't polite.

151
00:12:46,298 --> 00:12:50,132
Of course, that's always been the trouble
with colored people.

152
00:12:50,236 --> 00:12:51,863
Quick temper.

153
00:12:57,276 --> 00:12:58,368
Excuse me?

154
00:12:59,712 --> 00:13:02,112
My grandfather used to say,
if he knew you boys...

155
00:13:02,214 --> 00:13:06,583
...were going to be so much trouble,
we'd pick the damn cotton ourselves.

156
00:13:06,952 --> 00:13:08,442
Am I conscious?

157
00:13:09,421 --> 00:13:10,547
Yes.

158
00:13:12,258 --> 00:13:15,091
-Why don't we just eat?
-Fine with me.

159
00:13:15,161 --> 00:13:16,719
Am I here?

160
00:13:17,830 --> 00:13:23,268
Grad students, shit.
You all don't know nothing about anything.

161
00:13:23,402 --> 00:13:26,565
Yeah, Zack,
I'm sure you're much smarter than we are.

162
00:13:27,506 --> 00:13:32,341
Christ, I know what you all are.
You're a bunch of damn liberals.

163
00:13:32,444 --> 00:13:36,141
-What are you, a Nazi?
-Or is that too far to the left?

164
00:13:38,317 --> 00:13:41,286
You all think you're so smart, don't you?

165
00:13:42,288 --> 00:13:47,191
You all just sit back, whine and complain
like you always do, but you don't do nothing.

166
00:13:47,927 --> 00:13:51,658
A war comes up, do you fight?
Hell no, you protest.

167
00:13:51,764 --> 00:13:55,200
-Protest can be a powerful thing.
-Protest is for pussies.

168
00:13:55,301 --> 00:14:01,171
Try fighting for something, putting your life
on the line, before talking about powerful things.

169
00:14:02,842 --> 00:14:05,675
You left-wingers make me want to puke.

170
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:10,641
You never take a real stand.

171
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:14,342
-A stand that you'd be willing to--
-Die for?

172
00:14:15,221 --> 00:14:20,318
No, boy, dying's easy.
Ain't nothing heroic about dying.

173
00:14:21,493 --> 00:14:24,724
But if you can take a stand
for something you'd kill for...

174
00:14:24,830 --> 00:14:27,799
...that's something. Something special.

175
00:14:29,635 --> 00:14:33,298
Okay, I think maybe you should leave now.

176
00:14:33,372 --> 00:14:35,863
I'm fixing to. Don't worry.

177
00:14:36,075 --> 00:14:40,239
One of these days, all you bleeding hearts
are going to learn that we're right.

178
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:44,581
Us people with jobs, I'm talking about.
Real people.

179
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:49,043
We do all the fighting, working, and dying,
and you do all the bitching.

180
00:14:49,688 --> 00:14:53,818
Grad students,
I'm glad you all don't join up.

181
00:14:54,894 --> 00:14:57,158
You wouldn't even know what to do,
would you?

182
00:14:57,229 --> 00:14:58,491
Guess not.

183
00:14:58,864 --> 00:15:00,661
What the fuck are you doing?

184
00:15:00,733 --> 00:15:04,533
I ain't gonna hurt him. I'm gonna show
you something. A little experiment.

185
00:15:04,603 --> 00:15:07,936
-Okay, Zack, we get your point.
-Fuck you all.

186
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:10,838
I fought for my country.
I killed for my country.

187
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:14,778
All the while, you were laughing back here,
hoping we'd fall on our faces.

188
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:17,348
-Please, stop it!
-Calm down, Zack!

189
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:21,079
Fuck you!
Look at your buddy here, scared white.

190
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:24,353
Blue eyes, a guy's holding a knife
to your throat...

191
00:15:24,423 --> 00:15:28,621
...telling you he's going to kill you.
Yeah, he's going to kill you.

192
00:15:28,961 --> 00:15:32,124
Then I'm going to rape your girlfriend
before I kill her, too.

193
00:15:32,231 --> 00:15:35,894
What are you gonna do, kike, bargain with me?

194
00:15:48,314 --> 00:15:51,044
Get this boy some balls!

195
00:15:55,921 --> 00:15:59,379
That shut you up, war hero?

196
00:15:59,558 --> 00:16:01,992
You think you can come in here and bully us?

197
00:16:02,094 --> 00:16:07,726
You threaten women?
Some war, us against some Third World country!

198
00:16:07,933 --> 00:16:11,664
Pushing buttons and smart-bombing chimneys.

199
00:16:12,471 --> 00:16:16,805
So tough guy?
What did you train on, Nintendo?

200
00:16:18,444 --> 00:16:23,074
I bet you didn't even get off the boat,
you ignorant fuck!

201
00:16:24,616 --> 00:16:26,607
You finished, rich boy?

202
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:36,325
You have soft hands.

203
00:16:36,428 --> 00:16:38,589
Stop it! You're hurting him!

204
00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:43,264
He's a tough guy. He can take it.

205
00:16:45,838 --> 00:16:47,635
I didn't mean to break--

206
00:17:16,969 --> 00:17:19,529
-ls he really dead?
-Yes, Paulie, he's really dead!

207
00:17:19,638 --> 00:17:23,574
-It's a side effect of a knife in the back!
-Oh Christ! Oh Christ!

208
00:17:23,675 --> 00:17:27,042
-Now you find religion.
-Shut up! Look at all this blood!

209
00:17:27,146 --> 00:17:30,047
-That was self-defense!
-He wasn't hurting you!

210
00:17:30,149 --> 00:17:34,085
-Oh, my fucking arm, he broke my arm!
-Wait. Am I an accomplice?

211
00:17:34,186 --> 00:17:36,245
Let's get ourselves together here now.

212
00:17:36,355 --> 00:17:38,380
A little late to be getting rational, no?

213
00:17:38,490 --> 00:17:41,050
I had to do something.
The rest of you just sat there!

214
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:44,323
-He broke my fucking arm!
-He broke his fucking arm!

215
00:17:44,396 --> 00:17:45,920
He was a right-wing asshole.

216
00:17:46,031 --> 00:17:49,194
-That's still no excuse to kill a person!
-It's a good reason.

217
00:17:49,268 --> 00:17:52,499
-I'm a murderer?
-We must tell the police. They'll understand.

218
00:17:52,571 --> 00:17:56,268
Of course they'll understand.
"College kid kills farm-boy war hero."

219
00:17:56,375 --> 00:17:58,206
You'll probably just get a ticket.

220
00:17:58,277 --> 00:18:00,871
Marc could plead insanity.
We'll cover for you, Marc.

221
00:18:00,946 --> 00:18:03,779
Van Gogh did some of his best work
in an asylum.

222
00:18:03,882 --> 00:18:06,282
-Thanks.
-I can't believe this.

223
00:18:06,385 --> 00:18:09,752
This man's dead. He's not breathing.
He's never getting up again.

224
00:18:09,855 --> 00:18:13,291
And all you can think about
is Marc's future employment opportunities!

225
00:18:13,392 --> 00:18:17,886
We could discuss Zack's future opportunities,
but at this point, I think they are limited.

226
00:18:19,264 --> 00:18:20,595
Oh, my God!

227
00:18:20,699 --> 00:18:23,930
Calm down, Paulie.
Somebody give her a drink!

228
00:18:24,203 --> 00:18:25,795
I need a drink!

229
00:18:27,406 --> 00:18:30,569
I will not calm down!
Nobody should calm down!

230
00:18:31,410 --> 00:18:33,469
You all act like we do this every Sunday!

231
00:18:33,579 --> 00:18:37,379
Invite a guest over and if we don't agree
with his politics, then kill him!

232
00:18:37,449 --> 00:18:40,247
He pulled a knife.
He threatened to rape you.

233
00:18:40,319 --> 00:18:44,255
We're all in shock.
We're just dealing with it in our different ways.

234
00:18:44,323 --> 00:18:45,722
You got that right.

235
00:18:45,824 --> 00:18:48,793
I say we just bury the cracker and eat dessert.

236
00:18:49,461 --> 00:18:51,258
This is terrible!

237
00:18:51,563 --> 00:18:54,657
It's not that bad, Paulie.
People get killed every day.

238
00:18:54,766 --> 00:18:57,234
People a lot nicer and more innocent than Zack.

239
00:18:57,302 --> 00:18:59,930
If you want to feel bad,
feel bad about one of them.

240
00:19:00,005 --> 00:19:02,838
He was carrying a hunting knife.
What's up with that?

241
00:19:02,941 --> 00:19:03,999
Maybe he was a hunter!

242
00:19:04,109 --> 00:19:06,441
People shouldn't go around carrying big knives.

243
00:19:06,512 --> 00:19:09,845
Hey, it's not illegal to carry a big knife!

244
00:19:09,948 --> 00:19:11,813
It should be. Look what happened.

245
00:19:11,917 --> 00:19:15,580
It is, however, illegal to stab someone!
Especially in the back!

246
00:19:15,654 --> 00:19:19,181
-Why don't you just give him your card!
-We have to tell the police!

247
00:19:19,291 --> 00:19:21,816
-Yes!
-I'm not going to be an accomplice.

248
00:19:21,927 --> 00:19:26,330
I really admire how you consistently
put your feelings first before anybody else.

249
00:19:26,431 --> 00:19:28,956
You're the one sending your boyfriend
to the pokey.

250
00:19:29,034 --> 00:19:32,003
Okay, listen! Let's just tell them the truth.

251
00:19:32,104 --> 00:19:35,198
Zack got drunk. Marc got drunk.
Marc stabbed him.

252
00:19:35,307 --> 00:19:37,775
At worst, you'll get involuntary manslaughter.

253
00:19:37,843 --> 00:19:41,506
-I didn't get drunk. I smoked dope.
-Yeah, tell them that.

254
00:19:41,613 --> 00:19:45,140
Listen, I'm being serious.
It was an accident. They'll understand.

255
00:19:45,217 --> 00:19:48,846
"Officer, to make a long story short,
we had this guy over for dinner.

256
00:19:48,954 --> 00:19:51,047
"He was rude,
so Marc stabbed him in the back!

257
00:19:51,156 --> 00:19:53,386
"Do you have a problem with that?"
Wake up!

258
00:19:53,492 --> 00:19:54,720
Bitch!

259
00:19:55,327 --> 00:19:59,286
All right, do I need a coat?

260
00:19:59,364 --> 00:20:01,525
-I'll go with you.
-Hold on.

261
00:20:01,633 --> 00:20:03,999
-Come on.
-The police are an option.

262
00:20:04,069 --> 00:20:06,503
-They're the only option.
-There is another option.

263
00:20:06,572 --> 00:20:09,006
Yes! Take me to a hospital!

264
00:20:10,676 --> 00:20:11,973
Hear me out.

265
00:20:15,347 --> 00:20:17,338
What if we just forget about it?

266
00:20:17,683 --> 00:20:18,843
Are you out of your mind?

267
00:20:18,917 --> 00:20:23,854
Listen. Say we just bury this guy
in the backyard or something.

268
00:20:23,922 --> 00:20:27,722
-People disappear all the time.
-Especially in lowa.

269
00:20:27,826 --> 00:20:30,522
We probably saved him
from an alien abduction.

270
00:20:30,996 --> 00:20:35,899
We don't report anything.
We don't tell anyone. We just let this pass.

271
00:20:36,001 --> 00:20:38,868
No! We don't just let this pass.

272
00:20:38,937 --> 00:20:42,930
No? You want to go to jail for this fascist fuck?

273
00:20:43,041 --> 00:20:44,372
He's dead, Luke!

274
00:20:44,443 --> 00:20:48,504
Exactly. And nothing is going to change that.

275
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:51,708
Luke is right.
We all know it was an accident.

276
00:20:51,783 --> 00:20:56,948
If we let this pass,
we can go on with the rest of our lives.

277
00:20:57,889 --> 00:21:01,290
If we don't let this pass,
things will never be the same.

278
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:03,792
Things already will never be the same.

279
00:21:04,062 --> 00:21:07,190
Have I mentioned
that my fucking arm is fucking broken!

280
00:21:07,266 --> 00:21:08,563
Yes!

281
00:21:09,034 --> 00:21:12,060
-Pete, where's Zack's truck?
-It's out front.

282
00:21:12,137 --> 00:21:17,234
Good, this is what we're going to do.
Paulie, Jude, take Pete to the hospital.

283
00:21:17,309 --> 00:21:18,469
Yea!

284
00:21:19,811 --> 00:21:22,371
Marc? Marc!

285
00:21:22,781 --> 00:21:23,873
What?

286
00:21:23,949 --> 00:21:25,940
-I want you to help me bury the body.
-Okay.

287
00:21:26,051 --> 00:21:28,542
Then I'll drive the truck somewhere far.

288
00:21:29,488 --> 00:21:31,649
Then.... Marc!

289
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:34,054
-Marc?
-What?

290
00:21:34,126 --> 00:21:37,789
I want you to follow me in your car
and bring me back.

291
00:21:39,131 --> 00:21:41,964
You're serious,
just pretend that this never happened?

292
00:21:42,067 --> 00:21:43,898
What never happened?

293
00:21:45,237 --> 00:21:46,261
Exactly.

294
00:21:48,907 --> 00:21:50,135
Oh, Lord.

295
00:21:50,575 --> 00:21:53,135
Is that the license plate
from the Mercedes last night?

296
00:21:54,146 --> 00:21:56,444
-Yeah.
-Was it important?

297
00:21:56,515 --> 00:22:00,144
Probably not. What are those?

298
00:22:00,252 --> 00:22:01,913
Leads on the kidnapping.

299
00:22:03,755 --> 00:22:07,521
You go on TV talking about Jenny Tyler,
everybody wants to talk to Alice.

300
00:22:07,626 --> 00:22:09,787
Three guys have proposed already.

301
00:23:19,264 --> 00:23:20,390
Nothing in the Times.

302
00:23:20,499 --> 00:23:23,400
We're all clear in the Tribune.
Did you check the USA Today?

303
00:23:23,502 --> 00:23:27,404
-Let's not flatter ourselves.
-I'm not talking about the front page.

304
00:23:28,206 --> 00:23:30,071
How about those Hawkeyes?

305
00:23:31,710 --> 00:23:35,612
I'm talking about the back page.
They have that little section on each state.

306
00:23:35,747 --> 00:23:36,941
Just do it.

307
00:23:40,285 --> 00:23:44,585
"lowa, Ames. City Council approves
expansion of the lowa State...

308
00:23:44,689 --> 00:23:48,181
"...athletic facility at a budget
of $2,000,000."

309
00:23:48,693 --> 00:23:50,593
I think we're in the clear.

310
00:23:50,695 --> 00:23:54,756
And will you take off those glasses
and that homeboy hat?

311
00:23:59,905 --> 00:24:02,567
-You got a problem?
-Asshole.

312
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:09,873
That's a guy we should have over for dinner.

313
00:24:12,884 --> 00:24:13,018
Here's a hypothetical.

314
00:24:13,018 --> 00:24:14,383
Here's a hypothetical.

315
00:24:14,453 --> 00:24:16,944
If you try and trivialize this horrific situation...

316
00:24:17,055 --> 00:24:19,717
...with one of your stupid hypotheticals,
I'll scream.

317
00:24:19,791 --> 00:24:21,383
Just hear me out.

318
00:24:22,394 --> 00:24:24,419
You're a time traveller--

319
00:24:25,297 --> 00:24:26,821
Jesus.

320
00:24:31,169 --> 00:24:35,265
It's 1909 in Austria.

321
00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:39,071
You're in a pub having a schnapps
with a stranger...

322
00:24:39,144 --> 00:24:43,342
...a young art student with one testicle.
Let's say his name is Adolf.

323
00:24:44,115 --> 00:24:47,312
Adolf at this point in his life
has done no wrong.

324
00:24:47,419 --> 00:24:50,252
He's not bitter. He's not angry.
He's committed no crime.

325
00:24:50,322 --> 00:24:53,519
He does not bring knives to dinner.
He has not killed anybody.

326
00:24:53,625 --> 00:24:56,321
He certainly hasn't started a world war.

327
00:24:56,528 --> 00:24:58,257
Your point being?

328
00:24:59,965 --> 00:25:01,796
Do you kill him?

329
00:25:02,601 --> 00:25:07,095
Do you poison his schnapps
to save all those millions of innocent people?

330
00:25:07,172 --> 00:25:09,436
Would Hitler drink schnapps?

331
00:25:09,674 --> 00:25:12,336
Look, this is ridiculous. Zack was not Hitler.

332
00:25:12,444 --> 00:25:15,709
How do you know?
You can't look into the future, can you?

333
00:25:17,349 --> 00:25:19,943
I would kill the bastard slowly.

334
00:25:20,819 --> 00:25:23,151
You know where I stand. Pete?

335
00:25:24,523 --> 00:25:25,956
No comment.

336
00:25:29,895 --> 00:25:32,796
I would use something blunt
like a motherfucking chair.

337
00:25:32,864 --> 00:25:35,162
Paulie, it's not like we're killing Mozart here.

338
00:25:35,233 --> 00:25:39,192
We killed a guy that I am sure
was an evil force on this planet.

339
00:25:39,538 --> 00:25:41,199
An evil force on this planet?

340
00:25:41,306 --> 00:25:43,638
You have to start reading books without pictures.

341
00:25:43,708 --> 00:25:47,644
You're not God. You can't decide
who's good or evil, who lives or dies.

342
00:25:47,712 --> 00:25:52,149
But what if you kill somebody
whose death makes the world a better place?

343
00:25:52,250 --> 00:25:53,478
But that's bullshit.

344
00:25:53,552 --> 00:25:56,851
We have no idea that Zack's death
makes this world any better.

345
00:25:56,922 --> 00:25:58,549
My world feels better.

346
00:25:58,990 --> 00:26:01,424
-Maybe he was right.
-Who?

347
00:26:01,693 --> 00:26:04,423
Zack. Maybe he was right
about how we only talk.

348
00:26:04,529 --> 00:26:07,521
We sit back and let the conservatives
do whatever they want.

349
00:26:07,599 --> 00:26:10,898
They put aside their differences.
They achieve their common goals.

350
00:26:11,002 --> 00:26:15,098
We always seem to get stuck arguing
about the stupidest, tiniest, little things.

351
00:26:15,206 --> 00:26:17,572
What, like murder?
Conservatives are simple.

352
00:26:17,676 --> 00:26:21,874
No, they're effective.
So we buy animal-friendly mascara...

353
00:26:21,947 --> 00:26:25,110
...or we stop buying grapes,
but we don't do anything.

354
00:26:25,216 --> 00:26:26,945
-All we do is fight.
-We do not fight.

355
00:26:27,052 --> 00:26:28,849
-Yes, we do.
-No, we don't.

356
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:30,251
We do.

357
00:26:30,889 --> 00:26:32,880
We're liberals. We do the right thing.

358
00:26:32,958 --> 00:26:34,949
Then how come the world is so fucked up?

359
00:26:35,060 --> 00:26:38,928
-Because we don't run the world.
-Exactly, we don't.

360
00:26:39,030 --> 00:26:43,467
-You see, we finally do some good.
-Do some good?

361
00:26:43,702 --> 00:26:48,435
Think about all the right-wing assholes
the world would've been better off without...

362
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:51,976
...if someone had wasted them
before they did any damage.

363
00:26:52,877 --> 00:26:54,868
Anybody who ever killed an abortion doctor.

364
00:26:54,946 --> 00:26:56,538
Pol Pot. Idi Amin.

365
00:26:56,615 --> 00:26:59,482
-Josef Mengele.
-Joseph McCarthy.

366
00:27:00,251 --> 00:27:01,718
Joey Terrio.

367
00:27:03,154 --> 00:27:04,951
From Dance Fever?

368
00:27:05,557 --> 00:27:09,926
No, it was the kid from sixth grade.
Broke my glasses eight times.

369
00:27:10,261 --> 00:27:11,819
Little motherfucker.

370
00:27:12,664 --> 00:27:16,225
And if they're such big assholes,
we can't convince them.

371
00:27:17,836 --> 00:27:20,396
You're sitting across from Hitler.

372
00:27:21,106 --> 00:27:22,801
Still no comment?

373
00:27:27,779 --> 00:27:31,340
If it was Hitler, I would kill him.

374
00:27:33,952 --> 00:27:36,011
-Paulie?
-No.

375
00:27:36,688 --> 00:27:38,952
No. I would thank him for his schnapps...

376
00:27:39,024 --> 00:27:42,289
...get back into the time machine,
set it for home and go to bed.

377
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:44,658
Which is where I am going right now.
Good night.

378
00:27:44,763 --> 00:27:45,991
Good night.

379
00:27:52,671 --> 00:27:56,630
I wouldn't want to stab him though,
because that was too weird.

380
00:27:59,177 --> 00:28:01,168
I would club them.

381
00:28:01,346 --> 00:28:03,610
Obviously, we'd poison them.

382
00:28:04,282 --> 00:28:05,647
Obviously.

383
00:28:06,818 --> 00:28:09,844
I wouldn't want them to know
that they were being poisoned.

384
00:28:09,954 --> 00:28:11,649
It's bad enough they have to die.

385
00:28:12,557 --> 00:28:17,290
I wouldn't want their last thoughts to be,
"Hey, I'm being killed by these liberals."

386
00:28:18,396 --> 00:28:23,356
No, maybe we could scream
and act like it's some horrible accident.

387
00:28:25,036 --> 00:28:29,564
That way their last thoughts
on earth wouldn't be horrible ones.

388
00:28:31,676 --> 00:28:33,143
That's nice.

389
00:28:34,245 --> 00:28:35,837
Jude already knows.

390
00:28:35,914 --> 00:28:39,213
The blue bottle is bad.
The green bottle is good.

391
00:28:39,884 --> 00:28:42,011
What is that stuff anyway?

392
00:28:44,089 --> 00:28:45,351
Arsenic.

393
00:28:45,724 --> 00:28:47,817
None of us are going to do this.

394
00:28:47,892 --> 00:28:50,019
Probably not. But...

395
00:28:53,031 --> 00:28:54,799
...just in case the guy pulls a knife.

396
00:28:54,799 --> 00:28:55,390
...just in case the guy pulls a knife.

397
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:58,494
Everyone, this is Reverend Gerald Hutchens.

398
00:28:59,003 --> 00:29:01,164
-This is Luke.
-Luke, a pleasure.

399
00:29:01,239 --> 00:29:03,673
-Paulie.
-Paulie, a pleasure.

400
00:29:03,742 --> 00:29:06,438
That's Marc there. And Pete.

401
00:29:11,282 --> 00:29:14,046
-Nice to meet all of you.
-Nice to meet you.

402
00:29:14,119 --> 00:29:17,885
I had no idea
this meal was going to be so formal.

403
00:29:17,956 --> 00:29:21,392
We like to take care of our guests, Reverend.

404
00:29:22,427 --> 00:29:24,258
So, Reverend, where's your parish?

405
00:29:24,362 --> 00:29:26,796
We have a little parish outside of Maple Falls.

406
00:29:26,898 --> 00:29:30,061
-Really, that's where I'm from.
-You must have seen our manger.

407
00:29:30,135 --> 00:29:33,571
We have the biggest baby Jesus in the county.

408
00:29:34,906 --> 00:29:36,533
I hope you're hungry.

409
00:29:36,608 --> 00:29:41,375
I am famished. And it all looks so delicious.

410
00:29:42,113 --> 00:29:44,741
-ls that apple pie?
-It's homemade.

411
00:29:48,753 --> 00:29:51,119
Would you like to say grace?

412
00:29:52,724 --> 00:29:54,385
I would love it.

413
00:29:54,959 --> 00:29:58,827
I had no idea
that you younger people were into that.

414
00:30:00,131 --> 00:30:02,395
That's very charming.

415
00:30:03,067 --> 00:30:04,762
Shall we bow our heads?

416
00:30:06,437 --> 00:30:09,235
Bless us, Lord, for this bounty
we are about to receive.

417
00:30:09,307 --> 00:30:11,172
A fucking reverend?

418
00:30:11,309 --> 00:30:14,244
For this blessing of youth and kindness...

419
00:30:14,312 --> 00:30:18,112
...you have chosen to bestow upon me.
God bless us all.

420
00:30:20,485 --> 00:30:23,420
So, Reverend,
how do you and Jude know one another?

421
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:27,925
I interviewed the good Reverend
for a research paper I was doing.

422
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:31,959
Yes, on the vileness.

423
00:30:33,965 --> 00:30:35,455
The vileness?

424
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:38,159
The gay plague, of course.

425
00:30:41,039 --> 00:30:45,169
On the use of secular therapy
in comforting families of AlDS patients.

426
00:30:45,310 --> 00:30:50,509
The good Reverend was kind enough to let me
use his view as a counterpoint position.

427
00:30:53,685 --> 00:30:57,143
So, you don't believe in comforting the families?

428
00:30:57,222 --> 00:31:02,159
No, I do not believe in comforting the families
of irredeemable mortal sinners.

429
00:31:04,529 --> 00:31:06,963
Are those biscuits made from scratch?

430
00:31:09,467 --> 00:31:10,491
Really?

431
00:31:11,336 --> 00:31:13,065
They're lovely.

432
00:31:15,073 --> 00:31:20,340
-AlDS is not a sin, it's a terrible disease.
-Not quite.

433
00:31:21,479 --> 00:31:26,712
Homosexuality is the terrible disease
and AlDS is the cure.

434
00:31:27,852 --> 00:31:30,218
-ls there butter?
-Come again?

435
00:31:30,321 --> 00:31:33,518
-Butter?
-Butter, yeah.

436
00:31:34,158 --> 00:31:35,318
Thank you.

437
00:31:35,393 --> 00:31:41,263
When you violate the moral,
health, and hygiene laws...

438
00:31:41,366 --> 00:31:43,334
...you reap the whirlwind.

439
00:31:43,401 --> 00:31:46,996
You can not shake your fist in God's face
and get by with it.

440
00:31:48,673 --> 00:31:51,107
-Ready for more wine?
-No, wait!

441
00:31:51,442 --> 00:31:54,843
It's white wine and we're having meat.
We should wait for dessert.

442
00:31:54,913 --> 00:31:56,039
Yes.

443
00:31:58,750 --> 00:32:01,913
Surely, being a reverend
you must have some compassion?

444
00:32:02,020 --> 00:32:06,855
Yes, Jesus himself would be one
of the most compassionate men in history.

445
00:32:06,925 --> 00:32:12,022
Why, yes, certainly.
But Jesus would never touch a homosexual.

446
00:32:13,264 --> 00:32:15,095
But we're all God's children.

447
00:32:15,199 --> 00:32:19,533
We are all God's children,
but like children, we can get into trouble.

448
00:32:19,604 --> 00:32:22,402
And when we do, we must be punished.

449
00:32:22,473 --> 00:32:26,068
-Gerald is the leader of God's Way.
-God's Way?

450
00:32:26,244 --> 00:32:32,774
Homosexuals are the living, breathing
cesspool of pathogens.

451
00:32:33,785 --> 00:32:36,777
We simply propose to put them out
on a desert island with...

452
00:32:36,888 --> 00:32:39,982
...enough foodstuffs to last them
for their limited lifetimes.

453
00:32:40,091 --> 00:32:41,752
And what would that be?

454
00:32:41,826 --> 00:32:44,420
Say, two years tops?

455
00:32:45,296 --> 00:32:48,493
That way, for a nominal cost to us...

456
00:32:49,634 --> 00:32:51,625
...they would all die.

457
00:32:53,604 --> 00:32:55,902
-ls that radicchio?
-Yes.

458
00:32:57,909 --> 00:33:00,776
Has anyone close to you ever died from AlDS?

459
00:33:01,612 --> 00:33:03,773
-Really?
-Really.

460
00:33:04,582 --> 00:33:05,776
No.

461
00:33:12,790 --> 00:33:15,122
I think it's time for dessert.

462
00:33:21,666 --> 00:33:22,792
Yes.

463
00:33:30,174 --> 00:33:31,300
Thank you.

464
00:33:31,376 --> 00:33:32,543
I'd like to propose a toast.

465
00:33:32,543 --> 00:33:35,341
I'd like to propose a toast.

466
00:33:50,161 --> 00:33:53,187
To God's soldiers.

467
00:33:53,698 --> 00:33:55,188
I like that.

468
00:34:13,217 --> 00:34:16,209
This pie is delicious.

469
00:34:25,063 --> 00:34:28,328
-ls anything wrong?
-We're dieting.

470
00:34:30,868 --> 00:34:33,894
-Can I make a confession?
-Do you want more white wine?

471
00:34:34,906 --> 00:34:36,533
No.

472
00:34:36,607 --> 00:34:40,703
I think this pie might be a little too rich.

473
00:34:45,917 --> 00:34:47,441
Excuse me.

474
00:35:29,827 --> 00:35:31,260
Is he dead?

475
00:35:33,397 --> 00:35:36,423
-He's real dead.
-Oh, God.

476
00:35:36,767 --> 00:35:39,429
Maybe we should say
the last rites or something.

477
00:35:39,504 --> 00:35:41,301
No, you do that before.

478
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:45,307
We should just finish dinner
before it gets cold.

479
00:35:45,977 --> 00:35:48,775
How can you guys eat
with a dead man at the table?

480
00:35:48,846 --> 00:35:52,407
What is your problem?
You're the one that gave him his death sentence.

481
00:35:52,483 --> 00:35:56,283
"l think it's time for dessert."
What was that, Anne Rice?

482
00:35:56,354 --> 00:36:01,587
I think Paulie behaved, performed, beautifully.

483
00:36:02,260 --> 00:36:07,163
So do l.
We gave him every chance possible.

484
00:36:08,299 --> 00:36:10,096
I want to propose a toast.

485
00:36:10,334 --> 00:36:13,963
To us, for making a difference...

486
00:36:14,605 --> 00:36:17,165
...for putting aside our differences...

487
00:36:17,808 --> 00:36:20,333
...and for making the world a better place.

488
00:36:22,346 --> 00:36:23,370
L'Chaim.

489
00:36:31,389 --> 00:36:35,621
Please pass the radicchio. Butter?

490
00:36:37,628 --> 00:36:39,994
-Don't choke.
-Hit him on the back. He's choking.

491
00:36:41,332 --> 00:36:42,458
Not funny.

492
00:36:43,367 --> 00:36:46,393
-Are you okay?
-Jesus Christ, he switched the glasses.

493
00:36:46,504 --> 00:36:48,665
-He switched the glasses!
-Oh, my God!

494
00:36:49,941 --> 00:36:51,932
Get up, Marc. The Heimlich!

495
00:36:56,180 --> 00:36:57,511
Call 911!

496
00:36:58,249 --> 00:36:59,341
No!

497
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:04,820
Marc! Oh, shit!

498
00:37:05,656 --> 00:37:06,884
What?

499
00:37:09,994 --> 00:37:11,484
-You jerk.
-Jerk!

500
00:37:16,934 --> 00:37:18,731
-Let's get him out of here.
-Yeah.

501
00:37:30,581 --> 00:37:34,210
This was in the paper today.
They want to do another...

502
00:37:34,585 --> 00:37:37,213
...gay pride parade.

503
00:37:38,956 --> 00:37:41,686
Do you think that a bunch of gays and lesbians...

504
00:37:41,759 --> 00:37:45,195
...strutting through town constitutes a parade?

505
00:37:45,596 --> 00:37:48,429
Does anybody remember
what it was like when we were kids...

506
00:37:48,532 --> 00:37:50,557
...and had parades that meant something...

507
00:37:50,635 --> 00:37:53,627
...that were about real,
wonderfully festive events...

508
00:37:53,738 --> 00:37:58,573
...with people dressed in inventive costumes,
like kings and queens.

509
00:38:01,979 --> 00:38:06,439
Now that I think about it,
that does sound a little like a gay pride march.

510
00:39:07,111 --> 00:39:10,478
How often does a woman say, "No"
but she really means, "Yes"?

511
00:39:12,383 --> 00:39:15,546
She says, "Stop, " but she means, "Keep going. "

512
00:39:17,321 --> 00:39:20,813
You can't bring the law into the bedroom,
it's constitutionally wrong.

513
00:39:21,826 --> 00:39:25,387
Isn't violating a woman's body
constitutionally wrong?

514
00:39:25,496 --> 00:39:27,691
Isn't leading a man on wrong?

515
00:39:28,532 --> 00:39:32,127
If a woman accepts a date with a man,
especially in this day and age...

516
00:39:32,203 --> 00:39:34,899
...she knows what he's after and she accepts.

517
00:39:36,807 --> 00:39:39,674
So you think that all dates lead to sex.

518
00:39:41,045 --> 00:39:42,342
I don't.

519
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:46,541
Man is the dominant species.
Women are the dominated.

520
00:39:47,418 --> 00:39:49,886
They are the weaker sex and they always will be.

521
00:39:49,987 --> 00:39:55,084
We're not talking about species.
A man does not have the right to rape a woman.

522
00:39:55,192 --> 00:39:58,559
No, of course he doesn't, Paulie.
Rape is a terrible thing.

523
00:39:59,263 --> 00:40:02,027
But it is also much rarer than people think.

524
00:40:02,733 --> 00:40:07,568
When a woman cries rape,
it's because she's already consented to sex.

525
00:40:07,705 --> 00:40:09,570
-Really?
-Yeah, really.

526
00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:12,834
If she doesn't allow herself to enjoy it,
then she feels used.

527
00:40:12,910 --> 00:40:15,879
So women, vindictive by nature, cry rape.

528
00:40:16,013 --> 00:40:20,848
And force the man to suffer the feelings
of inadequacy that they themselves have created.

529
00:40:20,918 --> 00:40:23,512
The world stops and you destroy the man.

530
00:40:25,456 --> 00:40:27,686
It's quite self-defeating, really.

531
00:40:28,259 --> 00:40:30,921
Keep them in the kitchen, barefoot and pregnant.

532
00:40:31,028 --> 00:40:33,758
No, I think that's a little sexist.

533
00:40:36,434 --> 00:40:39,733
So this is what your parade is all about?

534
00:40:41,472 --> 00:40:44,703
We're stealing a chapter
from the civil rights movement.

535
00:40:47,545 --> 00:40:50,207
You got to fight for what you believe in, right?

536
00:40:51,949 --> 00:40:55,146
Absolutely, I think we can all drink to that.

537
00:40:57,721 --> 00:40:58,949
Please.

538
00:41:36,427 --> 00:41:39,123
Good evening, sorry to bother you.
I'm Sheriff Stanley.

539
00:41:39,196 --> 00:41:42,859
I'm going door to door and asking people
for information on Jenny Tyler...

540
00:41:42,967 --> 00:41:44,366
...the missing girl.

541
00:41:44,468 --> 00:41:47,995
I'm wondering if you could just take a look
at a few pictures.

542
00:41:49,306 --> 00:41:53,436
If I don't use everything
in my power to block that entrance...

543
00:41:54,111 --> 00:41:56,705
...innocent unborn children will die.

544
00:41:57,481 --> 00:42:00,541
And if I have to kill someone to stop that, well...

545
00:42:00,951 --> 00:42:05,012
...that is what the Right to Life Movement
is all about.

546
00:42:16,567 --> 00:42:19,798
These hippies want our...

547
00:42:21,338 --> 00:42:26,002
...Native American, heaven forbid,
I almost called them Indian, children...

548
00:42:26,710 --> 00:42:30,840
...to blame our forefathers for all
of their trouble instead of their own.

549
00:42:31,348 --> 00:42:35,842
Now, I'm the first to admit
we took this country from the Indians.

550
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:38,548
But what in the world were they doing
with it anyway?

551
00:42:38,656 --> 00:42:42,353
Shooting off bows and arrows
and using seashells for money.

552
00:43:29,873 --> 00:43:31,306
Die!

553
00:43:44,121 --> 00:43:45,247
You bastard!

554
00:43:45,823 --> 00:43:49,452
Brother, have you lost your mind,
serving me this filthy swine!

555
00:43:51,662 --> 00:43:55,621
I can't eat this.
This is why the first thing we must do...

556
00:43:55,799 --> 00:43:58,063
...is eliminate the traitors among us.

557
00:43:58,135 --> 00:44:00,797
Then we can concentrate on the true enemy.

558
00:44:07,811 --> 00:44:11,577
Alice! When the rain stopped,
the water went down to its normal level...

559
00:44:11,649 --> 00:44:14,641
...and it popped up.
Jack Mayr, with the leg brace, found it.

560
00:44:14,752 --> 00:44:16,117
Have you searched it?

561
00:44:16,186 --> 00:44:19,280
Getting ready to go.
I think there's some blood under the mat.

562
00:44:19,356 --> 00:44:20,755
See that, right there.

563
00:44:20,824 --> 00:44:23,850
Yeah, bring it up.
I want to run a search on the plates.

564
00:44:23,961 --> 00:44:25,451
Watch your step, it's slippery.

565
00:44:34,371 --> 00:44:37,101
Hang on, Jenny. I'm getting closer.

566
00:44:47,484 --> 00:44:49,679
I never really thought of it that way.

567
00:44:50,220 --> 00:44:55,157
Maybe you all are right.
Maybe they are just all people.

568
00:44:55,225 --> 00:44:59,491
They got feelings. They got family.

569
00:45:10,574 --> 00:45:14,476
You are entitled to your own opinion, of course.

570
00:45:15,045 --> 00:45:18,537
Yeah! It's true!
You got to beat them homeless senseless.

571
00:45:18,649 --> 00:45:20,844
Make sure they know their place.

572
00:46:24,314 --> 00:46:25,747
Are you okay?

573
00:46:26,116 --> 00:46:30,746
Yeah, it's just my stomach is killing me
for about three weeks.

574
00:46:34,491 --> 00:46:36,618
Maybe it's all these tomatoes.

575
00:47:15,999 --> 00:47:17,193
Bravo.

576
00:47:17,801 --> 00:47:19,666
Yeah, real nice work.

577
00:47:21,305 --> 00:47:23,000
I couldn't sleep.

578
00:47:23,106 --> 00:47:24,471
I see.

579
00:47:36,987 --> 00:47:38,545
Where have you been?

580
00:47:39,356 --> 00:47:41,119
I got to take a shower.

581
00:47:41,491 --> 00:47:42,890
Can I join you?

582
00:48:40,417 --> 00:48:42,885
I've never met anyone who's anti-Earth.

583
00:48:45,622 --> 00:48:48,716
I'm not anti-Earth. I'm pro-earthling.

584
00:48:50,294 --> 00:48:54,788
It's kind of hard to care about
the greenhouse effect if you don't have a house.

585
00:48:58,902 --> 00:49:03,771
You see, I think it all comes down
to evolution anyway. Survival of the fittest.

586
00:49:05,409 --> 00:49:07,900
I mean, if the spotted owl's time is up...

587
00:49:09,579 --> 00:49:11,979
...hasta la vista, baby, I guess.

588
00:49:12,082 --> 00:49:14,983
See now, your damn liberals, on the other hand...

589
00:49:15,786 --> 00:49:19,984
...they'd be protecting the rights
of the dinosaurs if they could.

590
00:49:23,160 --> 00:49:26,425
I would defend them, too,
if they weren't already extinct.

591
00:49:28,966 --> 00:49:31,764
A little wine. All right.

592
00:49:32,636 --> 00:49:34,331
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

593
00:50:40,804 --> 00:50:43,295
I shoot skeet. I have a license.

594
00:50:44,307 --> 00:50:47,834
Well, you should never leave an unsecured gun
in a car.

595
00:50:47,911 --> 00:50:52,143
I know that. I'm sorry. My car, it was dead.

596
00:50:52,215 --> 00:50:55,548
-And a guy picked me up in a truck.
-A truck?

597
00:50:55,919 --> 00:51:00,049
Yeah, and I didn't want to stop him
with the rifle in my hand.

598
00:51:00,390 --> 00:51:02,881
-What kind of a truck?
-A pickup truck.

599
00:51:03,727 --> 00:51:05,661
Did it look like this truck?

600
00:51:08,365 --> 00:51:10,560
Maybe, it was very dark that night.

601
00:51:10,901 --> 00:51:13,699
But it's possible. Was it this color?

602
00:51:14,671 --> 00:51:17,265
Yes, it's a possibility. Yeah, sure.

603
00:51:17,541 --> 00:51:19,702
Did you get a look at the driver?

604
00:51:20,410 --> 00:51:22,344
Honestly, I don't remember.

605
00:51:22,579 --> 00:51:24,444
-White man, black man?
-No.

606
00:51:26,516 --> 00:51:29,451
White. How do you say? Medium build.

607
00:51:31,621 --> 00:51:33,714
That truck belonged to a known felon.

608
00:51:33,790 --> 00:51:38,250
We found it dumped next to the Missouri River.

609
00:51:38,462 --> 00:51:43,229
I want to show you a couple of pictures.
Maybe you could identify the man.

610
00:51:53,643 --> 00:51:54,940
Nothing?

611
00:51:56,613 --> 00:51:58,308
No, sorry.

612
00:52:02,586 --> 00:52:05,248
We found traces of blood inside the truck.

613
00:52:08,058 --> 00:52:11,550
We're waiting for tests to see
if it matches Jenny Tyler's.

614
00:52:12,229 --> 00:52:15,721
That little girl? That would be horrible.

615
00:52:16,600 --> 00:52:18,898
I want you to think about this really hard.

616
00:52:18,969 --> 00:52:23,303
If you can remember anything
or you see this man again, call me immediately.

617
00:52:23,406 --> 00:52:25,567
-Understand that?
-Of course.

618
00:52:26,443 --> 00:52:29,935
You should consider yourself
very lucky, Mr. Van Doren.

619
00:52:30,113 --> 00:52:32,775
You might've been this close to a murderer.

620
00:52:43,360 --> 00:52:46,022
-We've been thinking.
-About us.

621
00:52:46,596 --> 00:52:48,496
-You have?
-Yes.

622
00:52:50,700 --> 00:52:53,760
We don't feel that we're giving people
enough of a chance.

623
00:52:57,474 --> 00:52:59,601
Remember the original plan?

624
00:53:00,877 --> 00:53:04,643
We said we wouldn't kill anyone
unless we couldn't change their minds.

625
00:53:04,714 --> 00:53:09,117
So we haven't changed anyone's mind.
Maybe we're not as smart as we thought.

626
00:53:09,553 --> 00:53:13,512
Luke, the guy with the swastika sat down
and you told him it was happy hour.

627
00:53:13,623 --> 00:53:15,887
I figured, "Why waste the food?"

628
00:53:17,127 --> 00:53:20,619
What food? We're not even giving people
a decent meal anymore.

629
00:53:20,697 --> 00:53:22,858
The fag-basher had Chinese.

630
00:53:23,166 --> 00:53:25,293
Chung King is not Chinese.

631
00:53:26,469 --> 00:53:27,993
We had soy sauce.

632
00:53:29,239 --> 00:53:32,299
Let's remember why we started this
in the first place.

633
00:53:32,375 --> 00:53:33,637
Yes, sir, master.

634
00:53:34,211 --> 00:53:37,374
Catcher in the Rye is supposed to be art?

635
00:53:38,081 --> 00:53:40,311
Thumbelina is art.

636
00:53:40,517 --> 00:53:44,078
Catcher in the Rye
is just mean-spirited garbage...

637
00:53:44,187 --> 00:53:47,179
...Iittered with the "F" word.

638
00:53:55,065 --> 00:53:57,533
I've heard enough. How about a toast?

639
00:53:57,601 --> 00:53:59,660
Come on, this is pathetic.

640
00:53:59,869 --> 00:54:02,497
Oh, come on. A toast.

641
00:54:09,112 --> 00:54:10,579
I'll get it.

642
00:54:16,353 --> 00:54:17,911
Well, thank you.

643
00:54:29,966 --> 00:54:33,265
Good evening, sir.
I'm sorry to bother you at the dinner hour...

644
00:54:33,370 --> 00:54:36,635
...but I'm going house to house to see
if anyone has information...

645
00:54:36,740 --> 00:54:38,469
...regarding Jenny Tyler.

646
00:54:39,709 --> 00:54:42,075
-The kidnapped girl?
-Right.

647
00:54:43,713 --> 00:54:46,204
I wonder if you'd look at some pictures?

648
00:54:47,617 --> 00:54:51,417
Sure. You know, I've got some company--

649
00:54:51,488 --> 00:54:53,217
It won't take a minute.

650
00:55:05,602 --> 00:55:08,093
Have you seen any of these men?

651
00:55:14,110 --> 00:55:15,168
What is it, hon?

652
00:55:15,245 --> 00:55:16,906
-Good evening.
-Hi.

653
00:55:19,349 --> 00:55:22,341
I'm sorry, this is.... I forgot your name.

654
00:55:22,919 --> 00:55:25,410
Don't worry, Officer. He's not driving.

655
00:55:25,488 --> 00:55:28,116
I trust you. Sheriff Alice Stanley.

656
00:55:28,191 --> 00:55:29,351
Paulie Layton.

657
00:55:29,459 --> 00:55:32,587
My grandfather was chief of police
in Maple Falls, way back.

658
00:55:32,662 --> 00:55:33,754
Really?

659
00:55:33,830 --> 00:55:36,799
Maybe you'd like
to look through this stack and see if you...

660
00:55:36,866 --> 00:55:39,460
...recognize any of the men in the pictures.

661
00:55:39,536 --> 00:55:40,594
Sir?

662
00:55:41,171 --> 00:55:42,195
He....

663
00:55:46,142 --> 00:55:50,704
He was chief of police for over 32 years.
They called him "Big Smokey."

664
00:55:50,847 --> 00:55:52,644
He drank, too.

665
00:55:54,351 --> 00:55:58,287
I'm sorry, Sheriff, but none of them
look like anyone I would want to know.

666
00:55:58,355 --> 00:56:00,687
Pretty scary-looking bunch, actually.

667
00:56:01,958 --> 00:56:03,721
I don't know any of them.

668
00:56:04,127 --> 00:56:08,496
You stopped on this picture.
Have you seen this man before?

669
00:56:09,733 --> 00:56:12,566
Yeah, no. I mean, just....

670
00:56:16,306 --> 00:56:17,830
What was that?

671
00:56:18,308 --> 00:56:21,869
I don't know. Why don't you go see
if our guests are all right?

672
00:56:21,978 --> 00:56:23,172
Sorry!

673
00:56:23,313 --> 00:56:26,305
Jude's okay,
but I think the dessert's about had it.

674
00:56:26,383 --> 00:56:30,046
-Good evening, Mr. Van Doren.
-Hi, Sheriff Stanley.

675
00:56:30,153 --> 00:56:32,815
Is this the house
where you were dropped off that night?

676
00:56:32,889 --> 00:56:34,356
We're roommates.

677
00:56:34,724 --> 00:56:39,491
Maybe that's why this picture is familiar to you.
Have you seen this man before?

678
00:56:39,596 --> 00:56:41,496
No, they haven't.

679
00:56:41,731 --> 00:56:45,030
Remember when he dropped me off,
you were all inside, remember?

680
00:56:45,101 --> 00:56:47,831
Yeah. Oh, yeah.

681
00:56:47,904 --> 00:56:51,032
Inside.... He was like, dripping wet.
It was like wet.

682
00:56:51,107 --> 00:56:52,904
It was pouring out.

683
00:56:55,512 --> 00:56:59,539
You went through the stack pretty quickly.
Would you like to take another look?

684
00:56:59,616 --> 00:57:04,246
No. I told you, they're very scary-looking.
I've never seen criminals like that.

685
00:57:05,522 --> 00:57:08,685
Your grandfather never had
any mug shots laying around?

686
00:57:08,792 --> 00:57:13,786
No. I died long before, I mean, he died...

687
00:57:14,531 --> 00:57:16,294
...Iong before I was born.

688
00:57:22,405 --> 00:57:23,736
Well, okay.

689
00:57:24,474 --> 00:57:26,772
-Thank you.
-Sure.

690
00:57:28,611 --> 00:57:33,207
Mr. Van Doren, for your information,
that blood we found did check out.

691
00:57:38,221 --> 00:57:39,313
Thank you.

692
00:57:40,323 --> 00:57:41,585
Good night.

693
00:57:41,658 --> 00:57:43,387
-Good night.
-Good night.

694
00:57:50,266 --> 00:57:50,567
What the hell happened?

695
00:57:50,567 --> 00:57:52,228
What the hell happened?

696
00:57:53,236 --> 00:57:57,002
-Barbara doesn't drink wine.
-So this fucker stabbed her!

697
00:57:57,574 --> 00:57:59,599
Pete, you were saying about the Sheriff?

698
00:57:59,676 --> 00:58:01,303
-Let me explain.
-What sheriff, Pete?

699
00:58:01,411 --> 00:58:03,606
The other day I got called in for questioning.

700
00:58:03,680 --> 00:58:05,113
Oh, fuck!

701
00:58:05,582 --> 00:58:07,914
It's got nothing to do with us, believe me.

702
00:58:07,984 --> 00:58:11,420
Remember that night with Zack?
I left my car on the side of the road.

703
00:58:11,488 --> 00:58:15,822
I also left my rifle in the car,
because I didn't want to scare Zack.

704
00:58:15,925 --> 00:58:19,861
The Sheriff found the car,
she also found the rifle. She called me in.

705
00:58:19,963 --> 00:58:22,932
-It's no big deal.
-Not a big deal? She had Zack's picture.

706
00:58:22,999 --> 00:58:26,127
I was getting to that. They found Zack's truck.

707
00:58:26,202 --> 00:58:27,328
Oh, fuck!

708
00:58:27,437 --> 00:58:31,100
-When were you going to mention this?
-It's got nothing to do with us.

709
00:58:31,174 --> 00:58:33,642
Listen, I got called in because of the rifle.

710
00:58:33,710 --> 00:58:36,941
Completely separate from that,
they found Zack's truck...

711
00:58:37,013 --> 00:58:40,505
...with some of Jenny Tyler's blood
in the back seat.

712
00:58:40,650 --> 00:58:44,313
The Sheriff doesn't know he's dead,
so she's looking everywhere for him...

713
00:58:44,387 --> 00:58:47,982
...because he probably killed that poor little girl.

714
00:58:48,057 --> 00:58:49,388
Oh, fuck!

715
00:58:50,693 --> 00:58:52,991
-We did some good there.
-Of course we did.

716
00:58:53,062 --> 00:58:54,893
You were right, Luke.

717
00:58:54,998 --> 00:58:56,966
Hey! Hooray for us!

718
00:58:57,700 --> 00:58:59,725
What if they trace Zack back to here?

719
00:58:59,836 --> 00:59:02,168
No, that's not going to happen, Jude.

720
00:59:02,238 --> 00:59:05,401
They found the truck
and that was not supposed to happen.

721
00:59:05,508 --> 00:59:06,566
She's right.

722
00:59:06,676 --> 00:59:09,201
Maybe this is a sign
that we should just slow down.

723
00:59:09,312 --> 00:59:12,247
-Paranoia, paranoia!
-What are you talking about?

724
00:59:12,348 --> 00:59:15,806
We got rid of a child murderer
and now you're acting like we're wrong.

725
00:59:15,885 --> 00:59:19,412
What if Zack had lived?
We stopped him before he killed anyone else.

726
00:59:19,522 --> 00:59:21,854
Isn't that why we started this?

727
00:59:21,925 --> 00:59:23,893
But look at her.

728
00:59:24,827 --> 00:59:28,194
She was just an illiterate.
I mean, we're getting out of hand.

729
00:59:28,264 --> 00:59:31,392
We've been careful, Marc.
No one's going to touch us.

730
00:59:31,501 --> 00:59:35,062
We have to slow down. Slow down.

731
00:59:35,338 --> 00:59:38,068
-We have killed nine people.
-Ten people.

732
00:59:38,174 --> 00:59:41,371
-Nine! I was an accounting major once.
-It's only nine.

733
00:59:41,444 --> 00:59:43,412
-It's ten.
-It's nine!

734
00:59:48,618 --> 00:59:49,676
Ten.

735
00:59:49,752 --> 00:59:52,277
-You're not gonna count Zack.
-He was the first one.

736
00:59:52,388 --> 00:59:56,347
-He was an accident.
-lf he's in the garden, it counts. That's the rule.

737
00:59:56,426 --> 00:59:57,791
You are fucking crazy.

738
00:59:57,894 --> 01:00:01,022
There are no rules, okay?
We're killing people, for God's sakes!

739
01:00:01,097 --> 01:00:03,224
They're not people. They're people who hate.

740
01:00:03,299 --> 01:00:06,132
What are you talking about?
She just had bad taste.

741
01:00:06,235 --> 01:00:07,930
I didn't kill you for that haircut.

742
01:00:08,037 --> 01:00:11,404
That's a good one coming
from a fashion victim like you, you moron.

743
01:00:11,474 --> 01:00:16,036
All I'm saying is we have to think more.
Think! Hooray for us, come on, wake up!

744
01:00:16,112 --> 01:00:18,546
All right, all right!

745
01:00:23,620 --> 01:00:27,147
Let's get rid of Miss Mensa here.

746
01:00:52,281 --> 01:00:54,272
Just go to sleep, okay?

747
01:01:07,497 --> 01:01:07,764
You might recognize Heather
from the newspaper.

748
01:01:07,764 --> 01:01:09,698
You might recognize Heather
from the newspaper.

749
01:01:09,799 --> 01:01:12,324
She's the one who's suing her high school.

750
01:01:13,036 --> 01:01:16,665
That's right. The condom thing.

751
01:01:17,373 --> 01:01:20,536
That's how the press has simplified it.

752
01:01:21,044 --> 01:01:26,175
I'm suing the school because they're violating
my constitutional right to privacy...

753
01:01:26,282 --> 01:01:29,877
...by making sexual education mandatory
for graduation.

754
01:01:30,286 --> 01:01:34,552
I'm sure that's going to get you
a lot of publicity, Heather.

755
01:01:34,891 --> 01:01:40,056
But in legal terms,
your case is what we call bullshit.

756
01:01:42,465 --> 01:01:45,195
Why? That's the way things ought to be.

757
01:01:45,301 --> 01:01:50,238
Number one, the court understands
that especially in this day and age of AlDS...

758
01:01:50,473 --> 01:01:55,137
...sexual education must be mandatory
to insure the public safety.

759
01:01:55,344 --> 01:01:57,312
-No, that's not so.
-Oh, no?

760
01:01:57,380 --> 01:02:01,214
No. I don't go to those classes
and I'm perfectly safe.

761
01:02:02,351 --> 01:02:07,152
Sexual education and free condoms
sends a message to kids my age...

762
01:02:07,223 --> 01:02:10,215
...that they should be having premarital sex!

763
01:02:10,326 --> 01:02:13,159
But, Heather, you're a high school senior.

764
01:02:13,229 --> 01:02:16,323
When I was in high school, I was curious.

765
01:02:16,399 --> 01:02:18,492
-I'm sure you were.
-Shut up.

766
01:02:20,837 --> 01:02:24,933
Don't you ever have any of those feelings?
I mean, they can be really nice.

767
01:02:25,041 --> 01:02:29,876
No offence, ma'am,
but that curiosity isn't human nature.

768
01:02:31,114 --> 01:02:34,106
But rather your generation's lower standard
of morality...

769
01:02:34,217 --> 01:02:36,583
...that has put my generation at risk.

770
01:02:36,686 --> 01:02:39,450
Heather, you're not hearing me.

771
01:02:39,555 --> 01:02:42,854
No, I see a great danger in the world
and I want to stop it.

772
01:02:42,925 --> 01:02:45,450
We have to get back to family values
in this country.

773
01:02:45,561 --> 01:02:49,429
Heather, have you ever had sex?

774
01:02:49,866 --> 01:02:51,527
Luke!

775
01:02:51,601 --> 01:02:54,468
That's a very inappropriate question
for the dinner table.

776
01:02:54,570 --> 01:02:57,095
-How can you sit there, all of 17...
-17 and a half.

777
01:02:57,206 --> 01:03:00,141
...and preach to me about family values
and sexual education?

778
01:03:00,243 --> 01:03:04,373
-You don't know what it's like to have sex.
-I knew girls like you in high school.

779
01:03:04,447 --> 01:03:07,109
So stuck up
that the guys were afraid to ask you out.

780
01:03:07,250 --> 01:03:10,117
-Luke.
-You know what you need, Heather?

781
01:03:10,253 --> 01:03:14,587
You know what you really need? You need
a good stiff dick that'll shut that mouth.

782
01:03:14,657 --> 01:03:17,125
-Luke!
-Oh, shit!

783
01:03:17,226 --> 01:03:19,786
-Shut up, Luke!
-All right, I'm sorry.

784
01:03:19,896 --> 01:03:22,922
How about a glass of wine to loosen you up?
Come on.

785
01:03:22,999 --> 01:03:25,729
-I don't drink!
-One little sip ain't gonna kill you.

786
01:03:25,802 --> 01:03:27,099
What's the matter with you?

787
01:03:27,170 --> 01:03:29,434
Nothing. Let's drink and get this over with!

788
01:03:29,505 --> 01:03:32,338
-I don't think so.
-Why is he so mean?

789
01:03:32,942 --> 01:03:36,434
Let's not let Luke's little outburst
cloud the issue here.

790
01:03:36,512 --> 01:03:37,843
That's exactly it.

791
01:03:37,947 --> 01:03:41,747
Will you just cool it for a minute?
Can't you see that we've upset her?

792
01:03:42,919 --> 01:03:44,784
You'd better shut your mouth, man.

793
01:03:44,854 --> 01:03:48,950
-I'm going to walk Heather out now.
-That would be a bad idea, Jude.

794
01:03:49,025 --> 01:03:50,822
No, I want to go.

795
01:03:54,964 --> 01:03:56,659
I don't think so.

796
01:04:00,703 --> 01:04:02,967
-She's a child.
-Hitler was a child once, too.

797
01:04:03,039 --> 01:04:04,472
We're getting too emotional.

798
01:04:04,540 --> 01:04:07,703
-Funny, coming from you.
-What the hell is that supposed to mean?

799
01:04:07,810 --> 01:04:11,507
You'd better shut your mouth,
or I'll break your fucking arm, you know?

800
01:04:11,614 --> 01:04:12,979
Shut up!

801
01:04:20,690 --> 01:04:24,023
That's new, actually attacking someone
when you're facing them.

802
01:04:24,126 --> 01:04:25,991
Stop it. Stop it!

803
01:04:28,331 --> 01:04:29,355
Dick!

804
01:04:33,202 --> 01:04:34,669
-Thank you.
-We need a vacation.

805
01:04:34,737 --> 01:04:37,797
-Let me take you home.
-Figure this shit out after the break.

806
01:05:03,766 --> 01:05:07,532
What the hell do you think you're doing?
Those are mine.

807
01:05:08,704 --> 01:05:11,036
Getting rid of your lovely little borders here.

808
01:05:11,107 --> 01:05:14,736
Why don't you just put up a sign saying,
"Cemetery: bodies buried here"?

809
01:05:14,844 --> 01:05:17,005
Why don't you mind your own fucking business?

810
01:05:17,079 --> 01:05:20,537
I am minding my own business.
And you need to get your shit together.

811
01:05:20,616 --> 01:05:23,779
I've got my shit together fine,
don't worry about that.

812
01:05:26,088 --> 01:05:30,718
The travel agent's on the phone for you.
Going to Guyana over the break?

813
01:05:32,261 --> 01:05:34,593
Yes, spring break in Guyana.

814
01:05:36,699 --> 01:05:38,564
You enjoy yourself.

815
01:05:40,202 --> 01:05:43,194
-After you.
-Oh, no, after you.

816
01:05:49,045 --> 01:05:50,239
Bitch.

817
01:06:46,869 --> 01:06:48,461
Can I help you?

818
01:06:51,807 --> 01:06:54,674
Hi, I'm Sheriff Stanley.

819
01:06:55,277 --> 01:06:58,940
Are you trespassing
or just interested in olericulture?

820
01:06:59,548 --> 01:07:03,450
-What?
-Olericulture, the growing of vegetables.

821
01:07:04,220 --> 01:07:06,211
Yes, olericulture.

822
01:07:07,456 --> 01:07:10,983
-I've never tasted tomatoes this sweet.
-Thank you.

823
01:07:11,460 --> 01:07:15,726
-ls it something you put in the soil?
-No, just good topsoil.

824
01:07:16,065 --> 01:07:20,001
Got to keep the earth moving,
my grandmother always said.

825
01:07:21,303 --> 01:07:23,703
Is that why everything looks so dug up?

826
01:07:27,309 --> 01:07:28,537
It's a secret.

827
01:07:29,478 --> 01:07:33,380
Don't let it out
or everyone will start growing these things.

828
01:07:38,187 --> 01:07:40,655
Don't worry, your secret's safe with me.

829
01:07:41,991 --> 01:07:44,050
My business is almost done here.

830
01:07:46,062 --> 01:07:47,689
Your business?

831
01:07:48,030 --> 01:07:51,864
The Jenny Tyler case.
Haven't your roommates told you?

832
01:07:52,835 --> 01:07:56,066
Oh, yes, that girl.

833
01:08:00,176 --> 01:08:01,939
I think she's dead.

834
01:08:03,746 --> 01:08:05,907
There's always hope, isn't there?

835
01:08:10,753 --> 01:08:12,220
Have a good day.

836
01:09:38,707 --> 01:09:39,833
Damn.

837
01:10:40,369 --> 01:10:41,495
Thank you.

838
01:10:54,516 --> 01:10:57,280
We don't have a book.

839
01:10:58,220 --> 01:11:00,711
I'll have to call my publisher...

840
01:11:00,789 --> 01:11:03,724
...and have them send more
down here immediately.

841
01:11:04,693 --> 01:11:08,561
-That's the price of greatness.
-I think it's more the boredom of travel...

842
01:11:08,631 --> 01:11:12,931
-...but thanks anyway for the compliment.
-No, no. You are a great man.

843
01:11:13,035 --> 01:11:17,563
I'm a loud man. But thanks again.

844
01:11:19,475 --> 01:11:22,706
Say, you guys wouldn't know...

845
01:11:22,778 --> 01:11:25,770
...where a guy could get a decent meal
around here, would you?

846
01:11:25,881 --> 01:11:26,905
Yes.

847
01:11:29,251 --> 01:11:32,243
Can you believe
that Norman Arbuthnot was at the airport?

848
01:11:32,321 --> 01:11:35,779
I'm sure it's a real bitch flying
your own private jet.

849
01:11:35,891 --> 01:11:38,985
-How many drops does Luke put in?
-I think just a few.

850
01:11:40,229 --> 01:11:41,628
Well, fuck that.

851
01:11:42,731 --> 01:11:45,097
Mr. Arbuthnot?

852
01:11:46,735 --> 01:11:48,635
Would you like to say grace?

853
01:11:52,975 --> 01:11:57,002
I didn't know people said grace anymore.

854
01:12:02,017 --> 01:12:06,317
We don't usually,
but we just thought you might be used to it.

855
01:12:06,422 --> 01:12:09,516
Oh, for God's sake, no. No.

856
01:12:10,192 --> 01:12:13,093
If anything, we ought to bow our heads...

857
01:12:13,162 --> 01:12:16,928
...and thank Paulie
for such an incredible spread.

858
01:12:22,504 --> 01:12:23,698
Bon apptit.

859
01:12:25,207 --> 01:12:28,938
You know, I'm forever amused
by these people from the Christian Right...

860
01:12:29,011 --> 01:12:31,036
...who thank God for everything good...

861
01:12:31,146 --> 01:12:34,274
...and blame humankind for everything's that bad.

862
01:12:36,719 --> 01:12:37,811
May l?

863
01:12:47,029 --> 01:12:50,362
But isn't the Christian Right
your strongest supporter?

864
01:12:50,733 --> 01:12:54,794
Those people need somebody to follow,
they can't do anything on their own.

865
01:12:57,005 --> 01:12:58,233
Of course...

866
01:12:59,041 --> 01:13:03,478
...the moral majority makes up a huge contingent
of the Republican Right.

867
01:13:04,079 --> 01:13:07,105
They do. But they have very little power.

868
01:13:07,316 --> 01:13:12,015
They make most of the noise,
but the centrists do all the work.

869
01:13:12,421 --> 01:13:15,390
The extremes of both parties grab
all the headlines.

870
01:13:15,491 --> 01:13:18,324
But all the decisions are made
by the moderates.

871
01:13:21,263 --> 01:13:24,255
That seems to go
against most people's perceptions.

872
01:13:24,366 --> 01:13:26,095
Only naive people.

873
01:13:30,672 --> 01:13:34,699
I can rant and rave with the best of them.
But how else am I going to get heard?

874
01:13:34,777 --> 01:13:37,007
I'm not an elected representative.

875
01:13:37,079 --> 01:13:41,277
I'm a concerned citizen that sees
certain things wrong and wants to change them.

876
01:13:41,383 --> 01:13:44,716
-That's what's great about this county.
-But your views are extreme.

877
01:13:44,787 --> 01:13:47,620
And extreme views incite people
to extreme measures.

878
01:13:47,723 --> 01:13:50,351
I can't be responsible
for every nut case who thinks...

879
01:13:50,426 --> 01:13:52,724
...I mean something
when I mean something else.

880
01:13:52,795 --> 01:13:57,630
Look, I admit to sometimes throwing
in some pretty outrageous arguments...

881
01:13:57,733 --> 01:14:02,636
...to support my positions,
but, man, it's the ratings thing, you know.

882
01:14:05,941 --> 01:14:08,808
Besides, the average citizen knows
what I'm doing.

883
01:14:08,911 --> 01:14:10,469
What are you doing?

884
01:14:11,947 --> 01:14:15,713
Dissent. Being the voice of dissent.

885
01:14:16,652 --> 01:14:19,985
Jefferson, Monroe, Paine.
They were all critics.

886
01:14:20,756 --> 01:14:23,782
Pundits, if you will, before they were the power.

887
01:14:23,892 --> 01:14:26,952
This is excellent wine.
Willow Crest, Merlot?

888
01:14:27,095 --> 01:14:29,086
Is that what you want, Norman?

889
01:14:30,799 --> 01:14:33,791
Power? To be president?

890
01:14:35,971 --> 01:14:38,838
Luke, I already have power.

891
01:14:39,808 --> 01:14:41,173
The President?

892
01:14:42,644 --> 01:14:44,407
He doesn't have any power.

893
01:14:44,646 --> 01:14:48,514
He's got to answer to Congress,
to special interests, to the Court.

894
01:14:48,617 --> 01:14:52,576
-To the people?
-To a lesser degree to the people...

895
01:14:52,654 --> 01:14:55,987
...but I got power: one voice, one vote.

896
01:14:56,492 --> 01:15:00,428
But your followers, they hate anyone
who disagrees with you and your opinions.

897
01:15:00,496 --> 01:15:02,691
Followers of Nelson Mandela commit murder.

898
01:15:02,798 --> 01:15:04,493
Followers of Gandhi killed people.

899
01:15:04,600 --> 01:15:06,864
You compare yourself to Mandela and Gandhi?

900
01:15:06,969 --> 01:15:08,163
No, those are great men.

901
01:15:08,270 --> 01:15:12,468
Paulie suggested I have followers
as if I could control what people do.

902
01:15:12,541 --> 01:15:15,772
-People do what they want to do.
-Like hate?

903
01:15:17,846 --> 01:15:22,783
It's true. You have some harmful people
on the extreme left and the extreme right.

904
01:15:22,851 --> 01:15:26,844
But I suggest
that the more extreme those opposites get...

905
01:15:26,955 --> 01:15:29,014
...the more moderate this society becomes.

906
01:15:29,124 --> 01:15:31,524
Because when you average out
all those extremes...

907
01:15:31,627 --> 01:15:34,790
...you come up with a society
that's anchored in the middle...

908
01:15:34,863 --> 01:15:39,857
...and that's what we all want, isn't it?
A society where all of us can live.

909
01:15:41,069 --> 01:15:46,006
All races, all religions, all views, living together...

910
01:15:46,842 --> 01:15:48,707
...forging ahead as one.

911
01:15:50,245 --> 01:15:54,545
In any society, no matter how big or small,
you're going to have dissent.

912
01:15:55,817 --> 01:16:00,220
I mean, look at the five of you.
Can you honestly say you agree on everything?

913
01:16:06,228 --> 01:16:10,665
So how is any good supposed to get done?

914
01:16:12,067 --> 01:16:15,400
My friend, I do not presume to know the answer
to that one.

915
01:16:15,504 --> 01:16:17,870
All I know is you got to do the best you can do.

916
01:16:17,940 --> 01:16:20,670
You have to be the best individual selves
you can be.

917
01:16:20,742 --> 01:16:22,437
Otherwise, why bother, right?

918
01:16:22,544 --> 01:16:25,206
Anything else turns the world
to pure manure.

919
01:16:26,515 --> 01:16:28,449
I don't think you should drink that one.

920
01:16:28,550 --> 01:16:31,246
It's been out for a little while. It's probably bad.

921
01:16:31,353 --> 01:16:33,082
I think the wine is fine.

922
01:16:34,690 --> 01:16:39,559
I would never be rude enough to ignore
the suggestion of a lady. Thank you, Jude.

923
01:16:47,536 --> 01:16:50,198
It's 1909. You're in Austria.

924
01:16:50,706 --> 01:16:54,039
And you're alone with a young artist
named Adolf Hitler.

925
01:16:56,411 --> 01:17:01,371
Do you kill him? Do you murder him there,
even though he hasn't done anything yet?

926
01:17:01,817 --> 01:17:05,218
Because you know
you'll save all those millions of people.

927
01:17:20,135 --> 01:17:21,466
Absolutely not.

928
01:17:21,570 --> 01:17:25,438
You'd let all those people die,
knowing you could do something about it?

929
01:17:25,507 --> 01:17:27,270
I didn't say that. What I said--

930
01:17:27,342 --> 01:17:32,302
You don't say anything. You just talk
and talk and say nothing so many times...

931
01:17:32,414 --> 01:17:35,076
...that people think you're saying something.

932
01:17:39,855 --> 01:17:45,020
What I would do, Luke,
if you would let me finish, is talk to the man.

933
01:17:46,128 --> 01:17:49,757
Try to show him the error of his ways
to the best of my ability.

934
01:17:50,532 --> 01:17:53,990
Challenge his ideas. Exchange thoughts.

935
01:17:54,102 --> 01:17:57,936
Provoke change by intelligent debate.

936
01:18:16,391 --> 01:18:17,881
I'll be right back.

937
01:18:21,396 --> 01:18:23,296
I've got to get some dessert.

938
01:18:24,332 --> 01:18:25,856
I'll help.

939
01:18:34,042 --> 01:18:36,806
I have to get something for somebody.

940
01:18:48,857 --> 01:18:52,315
-We are not going to do this, right?
-We got the king in our grasp.

941
01:18:52,394 --> 01:18:56,262
Haven't you heard a word the man said?
Don't you see, he's right, we're wrong?

942
01:18:56,364 --> 01:19:00,061
Don't tell me you're falling for that shit.
He's Satan, for Christ's sake!

943
01:19:00,168 --> 01:19:03,660
-I don't know, he's making some sense.
-You blow like the fucking wind.

944
01:19:03,739 --> 01:19:05,263
He's giving us a prepared speech.

945
01:19:05,373 --> 01:19:08,774
He's so used to defending himself,
he's got an answer for everything.

946
01:19:08,877 --> 01:19:11,607
-He is an iceman.
-Maybe we're wrong about him.

947
01:19:11,713 --> 01:19:13,772
Maybe he does this for money and publicity.

948
01:19:13,882 --> 01:19:16,510
You fucking imbecile, that's even worse.

949
01:19:16,585 --> 01:19:19,179
Creating hate for money, the fucking dollar.
Come on!

950
01:19:19,254 --> 01:19:22,348
We have Norman Arbuthnot
in the palm of our hands.

951
01:19:42,410 --> 01:19:45,140
Can you hear yourself?
You sound like a crazy man.

952
01:19:45,247 --> 01:19:46,771
Is it crazy to make a difference?

953
01:19:46,882 --> 01:19:49,749
Is it crazy putting these assholes
in their places?

954
01:19:49,818 --> 01:19:51,979
Can't you see through his shit?

955
01:19:52,654 --> 01:19:56,090
Being full of shit is not a good enough reason
to kill him.

956
01:19:56,158 --> 01:19:58,217
It isn't the right thing to do.

957
01:20:02,831 --> 01:20:06,460
You guys are all turning
into the fucking Stepford wives.

958
01:21:03,725 --> 01:21:03,925
This is getting us nowhere.

959
01:21:03,925 --> 01:21:05,051
This is getting us nowhere.

960
01:21:05,160 --> 01:21:07,958
I'm sorry, Luke,
but you have to have unanimous consent.

961
01:21:08,029 --> 01:21:10,190
It's four to one that he lives.

962
01:21:10,298 --> 01:21:14,200
I'm sorry, too, Marc,
because he's not going to fucking live.

963
01:21:14,970 --> 01:21:17,336
And nobody is going to stop me.

964
01:21:19,074 --> 01:21:20,803
What the fuck are you doing?

965
01:21:21,710 --> 01:21:23,143
Oh, my God!

966
01:21:24,679 --> 01:21:25,873
He's Hitler.

967
01:21:26,581 --> 01:21:28,572
What are you doing with a gun?

968
01:21:28,750 --> 01:21:32,015
He's Hitler and your deaths
won't make the world a better place...

969
01:21:32,087 --> 01:21:35,022
...but his will, so just get out of my way.

970
01:21:35,423 --> 01:21:38,756
-Where did you get that gun?
-The Sheriff.

971
01:21:39,594 --> 01:21:42,392
-What sheriff?
-Oh, my God, the Sheriff!

972
01:21:43,899 --> 01:21:46,333
-The Sheriff's missing.
-Not anymore.

973
01:21:46,401 --> 01:21:47,595
Jesus.

974
01:21:48,403 --> 01:21:49,768
What did you do?

975
01:21:49,871 --> 01:21:53,671
She was on to us. She was sneaking
around back in the family plot.

976
01:21:54,075 --> 01:21:55,770
You killed a cop!

977
01:21:56,111 --> 01:21:57,738
You'd rather I didn't?

978
01:21:57,946 --> 01:22:01,040
You'd rather be in jail right now,
getting corn-holed?

979
01:22:36,384 --> 01:22:38,784
I thought we were all together on this.

980
01:22:39,387 --> 01:22:44,051
Serious that what we were doing
was something great.

981
01:22:44,926 --> 01:22:46,826
Now, I'm sorry she had to die...

982
01:22:49,331 --> 01:22:51,492
...but she was in our way.

983
01:22:55,503 --> 01:22:56,902
What are you doing?

984
01:22:56,972 --> 01:23:00,169
Since you've completely lost it,
I'm calling the cops.

985
01:23:01,309 --> 01:23:02,435
No!

986
01:23:04,746 --> 01:23:05,770
Luke?

987
01:23:06,848 --> 01:23:08,110
So shoot me.

988
01:23:10,652 --> 01:23:12,347
No! Luke!

989
01:23:14,322 --> 01:23:17,621
You have reached
the Iowa Police Emergency Hotline.

990
01:23:17,692 --> 01:23:21,628
All our officers are busy right now.
Please stay on the line.

991
01:23:22,364 --> 01:23:25,356
Your call will be answered
in the order it was received.

992
01:24:00,168 --> 01:24:01,294
Come on.

993
01:24:01,369 --> 01:24:02,802
-Luke.
-It's okay.

994
01:24:05,540 --> 01:24:07,531
Oh, God! Come on.

995
01:24:49,184 --> 01:24:50,708
Are you guys okay?

996
01:24:51,853 --> 01:24:52,945
Fine.

997
01:24:53,054 --> 01:24:56,956
Just a little nonnuclear-family-values problem.

998
01:24:59,594 --> 01:25:04,395
God, life gets more and more complicated
every day.

999
01:25:10,105 --> 01:25:11,868
The weather's breaking...

1000
01:25:13,475 --> 01:25:16,740
...and I just wanted to drink a toast
to all of you guys.

1001
01:25:30,792 --> 01:25:33,989
No, don't worry.
I didn't pour the bad wine.

1002
01:25:38,833 --> 01:25:42,234
Actually, I think we could all use a drink.

1003
01:25:47,408 --> 01:25:50,900
-Aren't you going to join us?
-No, please.

1004
01:25:50,979 --> 01:25:52,810
I've had more than enough.

1005
01:25:52,914 --> 01:25:55,576
Besides I don't want you guys waking up
to the headline:

1006
01:25:55,650 --> 01:25:59,450
"Old windbag, forced to have last drink,
crashes private plane."

1007
01:26:00,955 --> 01:26:03,446
Isn't it bad luck to toast without wine?

1008
01:26:04,592 --> 01:26:06,082
Not in China.

1009
01:26:13,268 --> 01:26:16,135
Anyway, to your health.

1010
01:27:02,850 --> 01:27:06,513
You know, wherever I travel
in this bountiful land of ours...

1011
01:27:06,588 --> 01:27:08,988
...the question on everybody's mind
seems to be...

1012
01:27:09,057 --> 01:27:13,153
...will I make a run
for this country's highest office?

1013
01:27:13,995 --> 01:27:18,932
Well, my friends,
some people would say I already have.

1014
01:27:20,668 --> 01:27:24,104
At any rate, all I would like to say
to you well-wishers out there...

1015
01:27:24,205 --> 01:27:27,174
...is that I shall do
whatever the people want me to do...

1016
01:27:27,242 --> 01:27:31,941
...because I am your humble, humble, servant.
