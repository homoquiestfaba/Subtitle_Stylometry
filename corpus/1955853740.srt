She got straight A's and was the class
valedictorian, which got her into Harvard.

Niki was also beautiful.

Maybe she just wanted
to be different from Niki.

43
00:04:08,681 --> 00:04:11,250
She was always skipping
school, or, when she went,

44
00:04:11,284 --> 00:04:13,253
she'd end up
in the principal's office.

constantly at the school

and her bad behavior.

And then there was
my youngest sister, Toni.

48
00:04:25,298 --> 00:04:27,767
By the time she was 10,
Toni realized

49
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:30,637
she had to outdo Chrissy
as the family rebel,

50
00:04:30,670 --> 00:04:32,472

And I struck out.
Lost the championship.

and I'm with all my teammates.

01:18:11,920 --> 01:18:13,955
Just the two of us.

it's still our wedding day.

1213
01:18:45,287 --> 01:18:49,424
And I am still the luckiest
guy in all of Rhode Island.

I got to see you in that dress.

1219
01:20:11,439 --> 01:20:12,440

You're both getting married
today.

01:21:38,193 --> 01:21:39,527
Thank you.

1228
01:22:11,459 --> 01:22:13,762
We are gathered here today

1229
01:22:13,795 --> 01:22:18,300
to celebrate the joining of
two souls very much in love.

1230
01:22:19,668 --> 01:22:22,170
Geoffrey David and Danisa Ann

1231
01:22:22,203 --> 01:22:26,875
are saying their sacred vows
of holy matrimony.

1232
01:22:26,908 --> 01:22:30,111
With Jesus Christ our Lord
as their witness,

1233
01:22:30,145 --> 01:22:34,849
Geoffrey and Danisa
become a single thread

1234
01:22:34,883 --> 01:22:37,152
in the great fabric
of the universe.

1235
01:22:37,819 --> 01:22:39,788
Their vows are forever.

1236
01:22:39,821 --> 01:22:43,124
Together, their love symbolizes

1237
01:22:43,158 --> 01:22:48,229
the great bonds of love we all have for
one another and for Christ our Savior.

1238
01:22:48,263 --> 01:22:49,964
She's wearing my dress.

1239
01:22:49,998 --> 01:22:56,972
Do you, Geoffrey David, take Danisa
Ann to be your lawfully wedded wife,

1240
01:22:57,005 --> 01:23:00,475
to have and to hold
for richer or for poorer,

1241
01:23:00,508 --> 01:23:04,679
in sickness and in health,
till death do you part?

1242
01:23:06,181 --> 01:23:07,449
I do.

1243
01:23:11,619 --> 01:23:12,887
Thanks.

1244
01:23:19,027 --> 01:23:21,162
And do you, Danisa...

1245
01:23:21,196 --> 01:23:22,330
I do.

1246
01:23:22,364 --> 01:23:24,666
(ALL LAUGHING)

1247
01:23:24,699 --> 01:23:26,301
