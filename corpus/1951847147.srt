1
00:00:22,940 --> 00:00:25,317
I have always been my worst enemy.

2
00:00:26,652 --> 00:00:29,321
Oh, my god, you are so late.

3
00:00:29,947 --> 00:00:32,157
Hudson Milbank.
God, you're so late.

4
00:00:36,995 --> 00:00:39,206
Even on the most important day on my career.

5
00:01:03,522 --> 00:01:06,066
I felt overwhelmed
by the uncertainty of what I have.

6
00:01:17,744 --> 00:01:19,121
I wasn't the same person anymore.

7
00:01:21,331 --> 00:01:24,293
I was now living in some kind of
horrific perpetual dream state,

8
00:01:24,418 --> 00:01:27,212
yet somehow still able to interact
without anyone knowing.

9
00:01:27,629 --> 00:01:31,758
Just going through emotions, on automatic.

10
00:01:32,259 --> 00:01:33,760
I'm afraid I will never get out of this.

11
00:01:56,533 --> 00:01:57,618
My life view was simple.

12
00:01:58,827 --> 00:02:01,121
One, I just wanted to be a
happy person with happy thoughts.

13
00:02:01,246 --> 00:02:05,083
Two, we were all a simple action
away from complete disaster.

14
00:02:30,526 --> 00:02:32,236
You should slow down man.

15
00:02:33,237 --> 00:02:34,696
But I didn't want to slow down.

16
00:02:35,405 --> 00:02:36,740
I just want to stop my recent thoughts,

17
00:02:36,907 --> 00:02:40,494
constant worry and never ending anxiety.

18
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:11,149
Little did I know that inhaling a harmless
joint twelve times in twelve minutes.

19
00:03:11,316 --> 00:03:15,863
could unhinge an already vulnerable brain
and send it to the bottom of the abyss.

20
00:03:20,242 --> 00:03:23,412
Jesus Christ.

21
00:03:24,947 --> 00:03:25,453
Jesus.

22
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:26,665
You just smoked too much.

23
00:03:26,957 --> 00:03:27,958
Jesus Christ!
You'll be OK.

24
00:03:32,212 --> 00:03:34,756
From that point onward I
would suffer from a symptom

25
00:03:34,882 --> 00:03:36,132
so frightening that it
would consume every minute

26
00:03:36,133 --> 00:03:39,678
of every hour of every day.

27
00:03:41,263 --> 00:03:44,558
The official name was depersonalization.

28
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:56,445
No matter what I did, it wouldn't go away.

29
00:04:11,293 --> 00:04:12,628
So what was it exactly?

30
00:04:14,213 --> 00:04:16,723
Depersonalization disorder,
in brief, involves the

31
00:04:16,724 --> 00:04:19,384
persistent or recurrent
experience of feeling detached,

32
00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:23,847
as if one was an outside observer
of one's mental processes or body.

33
00:04:29,811 --> 00:04:33,065
The sense that the external
world was unreal is strange.

34
00:04:33,649 --> 00:04:35,817
Like living in some hellish dream like state.

35
00:04:36,151 --> 00:04:39,780
In layman's terms, I was fucked.

36
00:04:41,031 --> 00:04:41,949
Can you hear that?

37
00:04:42,241 --> 00:04:43,617
Yes, I did. Is that bad?

38
00:04:46,370 --> 00:04:48,038
Put your arms to your side.

39
00:04:49,623 --> 00:04:51,291
Now touch your nose with your forefingers.

40
00:04:56,380 --> 00:04:58,382
Now you can open your eyes.
You're fine.

41
00:04:59,174 --> 00:05:00,300
That's impossible.

42
00:05:00,843 --> 00:05:02,177
I never joke about the head, son.

43
00:05:02,803 --> 00:05:04,721
My finger hit my nostril,
did you catch that?

44
00:05:05,222 --> 00:05:06,265
It was close enough.

45
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:08,016
But what about the nothing's real part?

46
00:05:08,892 --> 00:05:11,478
Perhaps you should see a
psychiatrist or something?

47
00:05:15,482 --> 00:05:16,483
I also live substantially below my means.

48
00:05:16,984 --> 00:05:20,237
Not what I was cheap,
I was just terrified that

49
00:05:20,279 --> 00:05:23,282
things get so bad that I
wouldn't be able to function.

50
00:05:24,199 --> 00:05:28,036
So I opened up my checkbook and found myself
in the office of a west-side psychiatrist

51
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:31,915
who's specialized in dealing with creative
types on the verge of losing their minds.

52
00:05:32,374 --> 00:05:34,501
Have you ever heard the word dysphoric?

53
00:05:35,711 --> 00:05:38,297
I knew it,
I've somehow gone crazy.

54
00:05:38,714 --> 00:05:41,550
That's psychotic.

55
00:05:42,217 --> 00:05:46,680
Dysphoric is when you just
don't feel right in your own skin.

56
00:05:49,433 --> 00:05:51,059
Wait a minute, say that again.

57
00:05:51,185 --> 00:05:54,062
Over the next week, I couldn't
stop talking about that word.

58
00:05:54,188 --> 00:05:56,815
It means I don't feel
comfortable in my own skin.

59
00:06:01,361 --> 00:06:03,322
Tom was my writing partner for seven years.

60
00:06:03,614 --> 00:06:05,324
We complemented each other perfectly.

61
00:06:06,617 --> 00:06:08,035
He considered himself the writer of the team.

62
00:06:08,577 --> 00:06:09,661
I was just the hustler.

63
00:06:10,287 --> 00:06:12,664
Even in my state,
I could sell better than he could.

64
00:06:13,207 --> 00:06:14,291
So how's the detachment thing?

65
00:06:15,083 --> 00:06:17,753
You could jam this fork into my eye
socket right now and I wouldn't feel it.

66
00:06:18,545 --> 00:06:21,089
but you're gonna be
ok for next week?

67
00:06:22,758 --> 00:06:24,051
I'm suffering here.

68
00:06:24,676 --> 00:06:27,346
Now, but this isn't important.

69
00:06:27,679 --> 00:06:29,181
Why did I have to smoke the pot?

70
00:06:29,848 --> 00:06:31,099
We had to sell something.

71
00:06:31,517 --> 00:06:33,185
I mean, I didn't even
touch a drug in high school.

72
00:06:34,186 --> 00:06:36,730
So you've been washing them down with pills.

73
00:06:36,855 --> 00:06:40,817
So, between now and then, I'm really gonna
need you to put down that fork.

74
00:06:41,026 --> 00:06:43,362
I could have just taken one or
two hits like a normal person,

75
00:06:43,487 --> 00:06:45,280
I smoked the whole thing.

76
00:06:45,656 --> 00:06:47,658
It's not the pot,
I smoked pot every day in my life

77
00:06:47,783 --> 00:06:48,784
and I never stirred a cutlery.

78
00:06:49,243 --> 00:06:51,411
Hey, do you have a turkey burger?

79
00:06:52,412 --> 00:06:53,412
Fuck!

80
00:06:55,749 --> 00:06:59,378
Alright, alright.

81
00:07:00,128 --> 00:07:02,881
What about the shrink?
Is he any good?

82
00:07:03,173 --> 00:07:04,842
He went to Harvard.

83
00:07:05,342 --> 00:07:06,552
Are things getting better now?

84
00:07:07,094 --> 00:07:08,095
It's great.
What's he say?

85
00:07:10,389 --> 00:07:12,933
He thinks it might be a
good idea for my self-Esteem

86
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:15,102
if we switched the order of our
names on every other screenplay.

87
00:07:15,227 --> 00:07:17,771
He's an asshole,
a Harvard asshole.

88
00:07:25,237 --> 00:07:28,115
Also I watched the golf
channel for 23 hours yesterday.

89
00:07:29,616 --> 00:07:30,659
Why golf?

90
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:33,911
I don't know. I find it comforting.
It's green. People are whispering.

91
00:07:35,581 --> 00:07:37,749
So you are not getting out at all?

92
00:07:38,417 --> 00:07:40,213
Look, I think this is
something a little bit

93
00:07:40,214 --> 00:07:42,129
more than just being
uncomfortable in my own skin.

94
00:07:42,546 --> 00:07:45,549
What do I do? Tell me what to do.

95
00:07:46,967 --> 00:07:51,805
Hudson, it's important that you socialize,

96
00:07:52,848 --> 00:07:55,684
even if you have to force yourself.

97
00:08:49,863 --> 00:08:52,241
I read on the pamphlet from
the National Mental Association,

98
00:08:52,407 --> 00:08:56,787
that after 12 weeks of psycho-therapy,
if you are not better, seek another therapist.

99
00:08:57,246 --> 00:08:58,914
I was on week 14 with Dr. Townsend.

100
00:08:59,081 --> 00:09:01,708
But we'd became more like friends,
so I didn't mind.

101
00:09:03,126 --> 00:09:05,170
So the S, that's for Scott, right?

102
00:09:05,337 --> 00:09:05,754
Yes.

103
00:09:05,879 --> 00:09:08,882
Can I call you that?
No.

104
00:09:09,591 --> 00:09:12,135
One way to survive the endless
time between therapy sessions

105
00:09:12,469 --> 00:09:15,556
was to distract myself with the
longest running movies ever made.

106
00:09:17,182 --> 00:09:18,934
These are due back Thursday.

107
00:09:19,059 --> 00:09:20,811
What if I watch them all tonight?

108
00:09:21,687 --> 00:09:24,314
Ok.

109
00:09:27,484 --> 00:09:29,236
Dr. Townsend.

110
00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:36,451
Wow, I can't believe I'm bumping into you.
How are you?

111
00:09:37,244 --> 00:09:38,537
Fine.

112
00:09:39,621 --> 00:09:41,582
I was just at the video store.

113
00:09:46,211 --> 00:09:48,213
Hey.

114
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:59,850
Well, I guess I will go home and wait for
our next appointment. It's tomorrow, right?

115
00:10:00,601 --> 00:10:01,268
Fine.

116
00:10:07,024 --> 00:10:08,317
Patient.

117
00:10:11,361 --> 00:10:14,114
The one thing that Townsend
did give me was Climesipan.

118
00:10:14,406 --> 00:10:16,366
The directions read, taken
as needed, which for me

119
00:10:16,533 --> 00:10:18,744
was Monday to Friday and weekends.

120
00:10:19,203 --> 00:10:22,039
One blue pill was the equivalent
of three domestic beers.

121
00:10:22,664 --> 00:10:25,250
Two pills cut my feelings
of hopelessness by a third.

122
00:10:26,251 --> 00:10:30,881
More was needed if you were, say, rejected
by a shrink you were trusting your life with.

123
00:10:31,048 --> 00:10:33,675
I adore the sedation
but there was one drawback.

124
00:10:34,885 --> 00:10:36,762
Sexual dysfunction.

125
00:10:37,304 --> 00:10:40,057
It got so bad, the average
sexual act did nothing for me.

126
00:10:41,266 --> 00:10:43,455
I had to find the most
extreme twenty seconds of footage

127
00:10:43,456 --> 00:10:45,479
and play it over and
over until it did the trick.

128
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:46,480
"Oh, fuck me with your tongue."

129
00:10:55,739 --> 00:10:59,576
Despite the restaurant snub, I decided
to give Dr. Townsend another shot.

130
00:10:59,785 --> 00:11:02,339
After all, he was out with
friends and that had nothing

131
00:11:02,340 --> 00:11:04,665
to do with his dedication
to me within our sessions.

132
00:11:17,094 --> 00:11:18,345
Go on.

133
00:11:19,054 --> 00:11:21,890
I guess this is... boring you.

134
00:11:23,308 --> 00:11:24,268
Excuse me?

135
00:11:24,393 --> 00:11:26,812
You kind of... fell asleep there.

136
00:11:27,145 --> 00:11:27,563
No.

137
00:11:27,688 --> 00:11:28,897
You were snoring.

138
00:11:29,022 --> 00:11:30,399
I was listening.

139
00:11:30,774 --> 00:11:33,068
Because last night, I was
in the bath, I figured out

140
00:11:33,193 --> 00:11:38,824
that I already spent $2650 on sessions
and I still feel crazier than I ever did,

141
00:11:38,949 --> 00:11:39,867
so if you were snoring...

142
00:11:40,033 --> 00:11:43,579
I think you are making this
bigger than it needs to be, Hudson.

143
00:11:44,329 --> 00:11:47,875
You'd also think those kind of prices if
we ran into each other at the restaurant,

144
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:51,461
you'd acknowledge me as
something more than patient.

145
00:11:51,503 --> 00:11:54,089
Perhaps we should talk about this.

146
00:11:54,214 --> 00:11:54,673
Perhaps?

147
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:56,216
Obviously you're upset.

148
00:11:56,967 --> 00:12:00,012
I think I am a little
upset because... I rely on you.

149
00:12:00,179 --> 00:12:05,350
You are my touchstone to mental
health and I think we have kind of a bond...

150
00:12:05,851 --> 00:12:06,852
Fuck me!

151
00:12:08,020 --> 00:12:10,522
Intense exercise was
my next course of action.

152
00:12:13,150 --> 00:12:15,992
I read that if you could
raise your endorphins high enough,

153
00:12:15,993 --> 00:12:18,780
somehow they could alter
your brain chemistry.

154
00:12:21,491 --> 00:12:23,577
I found a class packed with lesbians.

155
00:12:24,244 --> 00:12:27,039
Not by choice, but still
it was strangely comforting.

156
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:30,040
We need to go one more time,
so let's push it.

157
00:12:43,541 --> 00:12:44,541
Everybody down!

158
00:12:45,682 --> 00:12:48,352
After 30 minutes, I thought
something might actually be happening.

159
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:51,313
but it was a wishful
psychosomatic false alarm.

160
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:54,650
My legs might as well have been
attached to one of the lesbians.

161
00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:09,456
I didn't know where else to turn.

162
00:13:09,873 --> 00:13:11,542
I hadn't been home in five years.

163
00:13:12,042 --> 00:13:17,047
Maybe some family reconnection was
what I needed to snap me back to normal.

164
00:13:20,884 --> 00:13:22,886
What's this spaciness with Sport?

165
00:13:23,011 --> 00:13:26,014
It's anxiety, that is all it is.

166
00:13:33,856 --> 00:13:35,566
Oh my goodness.

167
00:13:37,192 --> 00:13:39,194
Sport?

168
00:13:39,903 --> 00:13:42,781
I desperately wanted my dad's help

169
00:13:42,948 --> 00:13:44,783
but he was the king of pragmatic thinking.

170
00:13:44,950 --> 00:13:47,661
I got the same kind of
advise to all my worries.

171
00:13:48,370 --> 00:13:51,165
Do you think it was the pot?
I mean, why did I have to smoke so much?

172
00:13:51,331 --> 00:13:55,377
Just pull up your socks,
you'll be ok.

173
00:14:07,181 --> 00:14:09,488
I thought about reaching
out to my older brother Stan,

174
00:14:09,489 --> 00:14:11,393
who I worshiped since I was a kid.

175
00:14:18,775 --> 00:14:20,235
I'm busy.

176
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:22,571
Can I at least get a glass
of water before I ride back?

177
00:14:22,738 --> 00:14:25,449
I'm in the middle of a writing session,
there's a gas station on the corner.

178
00:14:34,082 --> 00:14:34,750
Sport?

179
00:14:35,083 --> 00:14:36,168
I can't breathe.

180
00:14:36,335 --> 00:14:38,879
What is it?
He says he can't breathe.

181
00:14:39,713 --> 00:14:43,383
For goodness sake.
Stop acting like a child!

182
00:15:10,077 --> 00:15:15,249
I think that's enough, Sport.

183
00:15:22,506 --> 00:15:27,678
Re-connecting wasn't the answer.
I had to get back to LA and somehow heal myself.

184
00:15:37,679 --> 00:15:38,679
Come on.
Get up! Get UP!

185
00:15:51,743 --> 00:15:54,413
Ok, got to get you dressed,
got a meeting in thirty.

186
00:15:57,708 --> 00:15:58,709
What do you think,
jeans and T-Shirt today?

187
00:15:59,084 --> 00:16:01,503
I'm dying here.

188
00:16:01,628 --> 00:16:03,714
Alright, then I'll drive.

189
00:16:04,715 --> 00:16:06,383
I have to sleep.

190
00:16:07,384 --> 00:16:10,262
How about this shirt?
Look at this.

191
00:16:10,762 --> 00:16:13,765
Oh my god.
You kidding me?

192
00:16:14,224 --> 00:16:15,475
I can't, I can't do this.

193
00:16:15,642 --> 00:16:18,937
Of course you can. The shirt
goes on top, watch this move.

194
00:16:18,979 --> 00:16:21,231
Pants, big surprise to
everyone, go on the bottom.

195
00:16:21,356 --> 00:16:24,776
Right? We've got leg crossed,
leg crossed the pant.

196
00:16:24,943 --> 00:16:28,030
Where are the shoes? Got to have shoes.
You know why? Cause we're going outside.

197
00:16:28,155 --> 00:16:31,180
That's right. You are handsome man,
I am gonna

198
00:16:31,181 --> 00:16:34,077
wait in the car.
We got to get this job, buddy.

199
00:16:41,543 --> 00:16:44,171
So how are you doing now?

200
00:16:48,884 --> 00:16:50,511
But that's better than in the car, right?

201
00:16:54,139 --> 00:16:56,391
Can you just fight this
until after the meeting?

202
00:16:56,517 --> 00:16:58,060
No, but I think I can manage it.

203
00:16:58,185 --> 00:16:58,977
Ok, that's all I need.

204
00:17:02,064 --> 00:17:04,107
He's ready for you.

205
00:17:33,136 --> 00:17:34,513
Sorry I'm late.

206
00:17:38,517 --> 00:17:40,936
Fuck.

207
00:17:44,314 --> 00:17:47,010
For some reason,
just looking at her jolted me

208
00:17:47,011 --> 00:17:49,820
into a state of awareness
and back to the job at hand.

209
00:17:49,945 --> 00:17:56,201
So would you like the $50 million version
or the $100 million version?

210
00:18:07,713 --> 00:18:09,756
That girl is an angel.

211
00:18:10,382 --> 00:18:12,050
What? Who?

212
00:18:12,843 --> 00:18:14,928
The development girl.

213
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:18,557
Oh no. No, no, no.
Please god no.

214
00:18:18,558 --> 00:18:19,558
What?

215
00:18:20,976 --> 00:18:24,116
Remember the last kid, the copy girl.

216
00:18:24,117 --> 00:18:28,275
The flower, the rain,
obsessing of her with zeal.

217
00:18:28,442 --> 00:18:30,319
We worked for a year after that.

218
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:32,613
Well, there's something
different about this girl.

219
00:18:35,949 --> 00:18:37,117
Alright, maybe there is

220
00:18:37,284 --> 00:18:39,203
something very
different about this girl.

221
00:18:40,370 --> 00:18:44,751
Just, there's also something very different
about the money coming in.

222
00:18:44,752 --> 00:18:45,752
OK?

223
00:19:41,306 --> 00:19:43,517
Hello, is Hudson there?

224
00:19:46,518 --> 00:19:47,518
Is this Hudson?

225
00:19:47,062 --> 00:19:50,231
Yes, who is this?

226
00:19:50,232 --> 00:19:52,109
Sara Harrison.

227
00:19:56,405 --> 00:19:57,614
Who?

228
00:19:59,157 --> 00:20:02,953
I was in the executive U&MI office today,
sitting next to my boss.

229
00:20:04,079 --> 00:20:07,082
Yes, hi, this is him.

230
00:20:08,083 --> 00:20:15,090
I hope it's ok I'm calling.
- Yes, sure, of course.

231
00:20:22,639 --> 00:20:24,433
I was wondering if you
want to get together.

232
00:20:24,766 --> 00:20:30,272
You and me?
Uh-huh.

233
00:20:30,273 --> 00:20:31,273
When?

234
00:20:38,530 --> 00:20:42,576
Just an ordinary, everyday spoon.
You've seen it a thousand times.

235
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:46,038
Just an ordinary piece
of kitchen cutlery, see?

236
00:20:55,380 --> 00:20:56,757
Pretty impressive,
where'd it go?

237
00:20:56,882 --> 00:20:58,133
That's magic.

238
00:21:00,134 --> 00:21:01,134
In your lap?

239
00:21:02,471 --> 00:21:04,348
That's a stupid trick, really.

240
00:21:05,474 --> 00:21:08,560
You know, I've seen you before
at a party a couple of weeks ago.

241
00:21:08,894 --> 00:21:11,730
You were sitting on a couch by yourself
and this dog came up to you.

242
00:21:11,897 --> 00:21:14,066
You fed it a potato chip.

243
00:21:18,403 --> 00:21:19,655
You looked really lonely.

244
00:21:21,615 --> 00:21:26,495
No, that's just the way that I appear
when I am really enjoying myself.

245
00:21:27,079 --> 00:21:29,748
You seemed really anxious to leave.

246
00:21:30,582 --> 00:21:31,458
I did?

247
00:21:33,252 --> 00:21:36,630
There's some fucking noticeable about you.

248
00:21:36,755 --> 00:21:40,676
So sweet.

249
00:21:40,843 --> 00:21:42,636
I cuss when I get excited about things.

250
00:21:43,095 --> 00:21:43,887
That's ok.

251
00:21:48,016 --> 00:21:49,226
My god, she was fantastic.

252
00:21:49,810 --> 00:21:53,730
And by dessert, things loosened up when she
started talking about her last relationship.

253
00:21:53,856 --> 00:21:56,767
So he took a gun out
of his glove compartment

254
00:21:56,768 --> 00:21:59,361
and blew his brains
out all over his Porche,

255
00:21:59,486 --> 00:22:01,572
in front of his ex-wife.

256
00:22:01,738 --> 00:22:05,993
But she was obviously attracted
to unstable guys, which was perfect.

257
00:22:08,829 --> 00:22:10,914
What's your biggest fear?

258
00:22:15,335 --> 00:22:17,004
I have two.

259
00:22:17,171 --> 00:22:20,591
The first is that I'm spontaneously insane.

260
00:22:22,092 --> 00:22:28,682
And the second is... 
something happening to my father.

261
00:22:30,058 --> 00:22:31,518
Like him dying?

262
00:22:33,395 --> 00:22:35,814
I really wish... you wouldn't say it.

263
00:22:36,148 --> 00:22:37,482
You're afraid of the word?

264
00:22:37,649 --> 00:22:40,235
Yeah, for some reason I
think the saying it might...

265
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:41,570
...make it happen.

266
00:22:42,571 --> 00:22:43,571
Yeah.

267
00:22:43,237 --> 00:22:44,906
It won't.

268
00:22:45,991 --> 00:22:52,873
Death, death, death, die, die, die.
See... nothing.

269
00:22:54,333 --> 00:22:57,961
Right, you're saying it.
Nothing's gonna happen when you're saying it.

270
00:23:00,547 --> 00:23:01,340
That's the way my mind works.

271
00:23:01,965 --> 00:23:05,802
I figured it out the other day that
life expectancy for a male is 72 years.

272
00:23:05,928 --> 00:23:11,725
That's 25,000 days and you sleep a
third of that, so that's just 16,000 days.

273
00:23:11,934 --> 00:23:14,634
Say you spend half of that
time trying to figure out what

274
00:23:14,635 --> 00:23:17,147
you want to do with your
life. That's another 8,000 days.

275
00:23:17,314 --> 00:23:20,852
Now I am 36, so that leaves
me only 4,311 days left.

276
00:23:20,853 --> 00:23:24,112
If I don't get sick or
hit by a bus or something.

277
00:23:25,697 --> 00:23:27,699
You're an unusual person.

278
00:23:30,077 --> 00:23:32,913
My father is a physicist,
he teaches stream theory.

279
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:34,081
That's interesting.

280
00:23:38,418 --> 00:23:39,336
Can I come in?

281
00:23:40,212 --> 00:23:41,880
Oh, I would.

282
00:23:54,184 --> 00:23:54,977
What's the deal with him?

283
00:23:55,143 --> 00:23:55,644
He likes me.

284
00:23:55,811 --> 00:23:56,645
Really?

285
00:23:56,979 --> 00:24:00,816
He leaves Cd's on my car...

286
00:24:07,698 --> 00:24:09,533
People always look at the numbers changing.
Yep.

287
00:24:11,493 --> 00:24:13,495
I think it's because they're nervous.
Yep.

288
00:24:33,015 --> 00:24:33,724
So what'd you think?

289
00:24:34,516 --> 00:24:37,019
This sounds good.

290
00:24:37,186 --> 00:24:37,895
Seriously?

291
00:24:38,020 --> 00:24:40,856
It's the worst playing of any
musical instrument I've ever heard.

292
00:24:40,981 --> 00:24:43,609
Really, you should throw
that thing into the fireplace.

293
00:24:51,992 --> 00:24:54,453
Where did you get all of this stuff?

294
00:24:55,913 --> 00:24:56,788
What is that?

295
00:24:57,789 --> 00:24:58,248
A turtle.

296
00:25:00,459 --> 00:25:03,170
I broke its head off.
I was watching the basketball players,

297
00:25:03,337 --> 00:25:09,718
the fucking team didn't win,
so I threw remote control to the TV and it...

298
00:25:10,677 --> 00:25:14,223
I can see that.
You are insanely cute.

299
00:25:17,059 --> 00:25:18,810
You think I am cute.

300
00:25:23,398 --> 00:25:25,108
I kind of think I have a big head.

301
00:25:26,818 --> 00:25:28,278
Well, at least you have a chin.

302
00:25:29,071 --> 00:25:33,659
Look at this, straight line from my
chin to my neck, it's like a chineck.

303
00:25:35,369 --> 00:25:37,830
I think that one of my ears
is bigger than the other.

304
00:25:37,955 --> 00:25:38,330
I don't see that.

305
00:25:38,455 --> 00:25:39,164
Liars go to hell.

306
00:25:39,289 --> 00:25:40,249
Yeah, I see that.

307
00:25:44,545 --> 00:25:46,088
You really have no chin.

308
00:25:46,755 --> 00:25:49,299
Well, you kind of look like a lion.

309
00:25:49,550 --> 00:25:54,513
You kind of look like an owl,
an owl without a chin.

310
00:26:09,444 --> 00:26:11,029
I have to go.

311
00:26:14,575 --> 00:26:15,200
Where?

312
00:26:15,492 --> 00:26:18,579
I have an appointment tomorrow.

313
00:26:18,745 --> 00:26:20,455
I have to do something I forgot.

314
00:26:28,456 --> 00:26:29,456
What the devil is this?

315
00:26:31,175 --> 00:26:32,259
Did I just fuck this up?

316
00:26:32,384 --> 00:26:35,387
I'm gonna call you,
so be ready for that.

317
00:27:03,916 --> 00:27:05,000
You do kind of look like an owl.

318
00:27:09,755 --> 00:27:10,964
So you really like this girl?

319
00:27:43,288 --> 00:27:44,289
How is that?

320
00:27:45,207 --> 00:27:47,125
It was the worst lawn bowling
I've ever seen in my entire life.

321
00:27:47,251 --> 00:27:50,045
I think you should take the ball
and throw it into my fireplace.

322
00:27:55,425 --> 00:27:58,345
Over the next a few days, she was
able to drag me outside during the day.

323
00:27:58,512 --> 00:28:01,849
Luckily we did the things almost
just comforting as the golf channel.

324
00:28:02,599 --> 00:28:04,150
Nights were the worst
for me, so I convinced

325
00:28:04,151 --> 00:28:05,769
her to stay in and watch
the extended version of

326
00:28:05,894 --> 00:28:08,393
Lawrence of Arabia,
Bridge on the River Kwai,

327
00:28:08,394 --> 00:28:10,566
and the Right Stuff,
which we saw twice.

328
00:28:11,483 --> 00:28:12,734
She seemed perfectly fine.

329
00:28:12,901 --> 00:28:16,113
At this rate I could stay in
my comfort zone indefinitely.

330
00:28:18,991 --> 00:28:20,534
I think we should go out tonight.
Out?

331
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:29,209
I though we were going to watch the
Star Wars Trilogy with the commentary.

332
00:28:31,003 --> 00:28:34,131
I know watching the Star Wars
Trilogy with the commentary is fine,

333
00:28:34,256 --> 00:28:38,635
but I was thinking maybe we
could do something different.

334
00:28:44,808 --> 00:28:47,936
So even though the Millennium
Falcon was the oldest plane,

335
00:28:48,061 --> 00:28:50,272
it ended up making it home.

336
00:28:51,940 --> 00:28:53,358
Yeah, it did.

337
00:29:00,782 --> 00:29:02,743
I am thinking of getting
a new car, by the way.

338
00:29:02,951 --> 00:29:03,577
Really? Why?

339
00:29:04,036 --> 00:29:08,081
I just don't want you to think I'd
like driving something ten years old.

340
00:29:10,042 --> 00:29:14,338
A lot of people in LA don't have insurance.
So they don't care if they crash into you.

341
00:29:14,755 --> 00:29:16,548
You don't have to impress me, Hudson.

342
00:29:25,224 --> 00:29:27,518
And I am looking at homes.
Yeah?

343
00:29:32,064 --> 00:29:33,148
Let's go there.

344
00:29:44,284 --> 00:29:46,495
You ok? Yeah. You?
Yeah.

345
00:30:08,350 --> 00:30:10,060
It's impressive.

346
00:30:13,814 --> 00:30:15,315
I think you should give her $5.
$5?

347
00:30:15,416 --> 00:30:16,416
Yep.

348
00:30:20,404 --> 00:30:21,113
I only have a 20.

349
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:22,698
I'll pay you back.

350
00:30:35,919 --> 00:30:37,713
You should wash your hands.

351
00:30:42,968 --> 00:30:45,679
I am gonna go get some hand-sanitizers.

352
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:47,680
OK.

353
00:31:20,756 --> 00:31:22,674
What if there weren't locks
and stores open twenty...

354
00:31:22,841 --> 00:31:25,010
Do you steal a lot?

355
00:31:27,179 --> 00:31:28,222
What stealing?
The pen...

356
00:31:30,015 --> 00:31:30,891
No, I paid for that.

357
00:31:31,016 --> 00:31:35,229
Don't lie.
Fucking hate that.

358
00:31:35,395 --> 00:31:36,647
Why do you do it?

359
00:31:41,151 --> 00:31:42,444
I don't know.
Yeah, you do.

360
00:31:52,037 --> 00:31:56,458
Maybe it gives me a... well, sense of control.

361
00:31:58,210 --> 00:31:59,044
I can't date somebody that does that.

362
00:31:59,211 --> 00:32:01,004
It's only small stuff.
Doesn't matter, it's not right.

363
00:32:02,965 --> 00:32:04,383
I know.
You do?

364
00:32:07,344 --> 00:32:12,099
Yes...
and it will absolutely not happen again.

365
00:32:12,266 --> 00:32:13,851
You just saying that to get off the hook?

366
00:32:37,583 --> 00:32:39,418
You returned it?

367
00:32:40,419 --> 00:32:41,545
Like it never happened.

368
00:32:45,799 --> 00:32:47,384
Thank you, Hudson

369
00:32:48,427 --> 00:32:53,056
No, thank you. Stealing is
bad, I don't want to be bad.

370
00:33:02,399 --> 00:33:05,944
You do realize that we
haven't had sex yet?

371
00:33:08,405 --> 00:33:10,741
Yes, I'm aware of that.

372
00:33:17,039 --> 00:33:19,124
Will you take me back to your place?

373
00:33:24,588 --> 00:33:26,673
Mine?

374
00:33:35,849 --> 00:33:36,850
It's kind of like a ski lodge.

375
00:33:40,851 --> 00:33:41,851
Oh, it is very chalet like.

376
00:33:46,276 --> 00:33:47,277
You rent this place?

377
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:50,447
I do pay a monthly fee.

378
00:33:52,407 --> 00:33:53,826
What the fuck was that?

379
00:33:53,867 --> 00:33:57,746
No, you're ok.
It's just a family of squirrels.

380
00:33:57,830 --> 00:33:58,455
Can I get you anything?

381
00:34:00,332 --> 00:34:01,041
What you got?

382
00:34:03,669 --> 00:34:04,503
I have pasta.

383
00:34:05,546 --> 00:34:08,298
I don't have any sauce, but would
you like me to make you some pasta?

384
00:34:11,176 --> 00:34:13,428
That's really sweet,
the way you say it.

385
00:34:14,096 --> 00:34:18,892
So...
how about some bottled water?

386
00:34:19,518 --> 00:34:21,270
Ok, here is the deal with that,

387
00:34:21,395 --> 00:34:23,313
I don't really keep the bottled
water in the house cause I believe

388
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:28,443
that it's a scam. See, tap water has to
undergo much stringent testing for bacteria.

389
00:34:28,610 --> 00:34:29,903
Tap's good.

390
00:34:42,541 --> 00:34:46,003
Hudson, what are you looking
for in a relationship?

391
00:34:51,592 --> 00:34:53,844
Ah well, basically somebody you can
stand being with me, I guess... Here.

392
00:34:58,140 --> 00:34:58,891
You?

393
00:35:04,313 --> 00:35:09,151
I want to know that if my limbs fall off,
we'd still be together no matter what.

394
00:35:12,696 --> 00:35:15,240
And when he says my name,
it sounds different from his mouth.

395
00:35:16,700 --> 00:35:19,077
You know you get safe there.

396
00:35:24,249 --> 00:35:29,171
Or... I put on perfume, he puts on Cologne,
and we go out, we could smell each other.

397
00:35:32,090 --> 00:35:34,384
He can make you smile when you are tired.

398
00:35:35,677 --> 00:35:37,387
That's a big one.

399
00:35:43,143 --> 00:35:46,313
And you tell him something,

400
00:35:47,481 --> 00:35:48,651
you're scared to tell
him because you're

401
00:35:48,652 --> 00:35:49,900
afraid that maybe he'll stop loving you,

402
00:35:50,067 --> 00:35:54,780
but when you tell him, you are surprised
because actually it makes him love you more.

403
00:36:00,410 --> 00:36:05,332
Or, you tell him that you love his
shirt and he ends up wearing it every day.

404
00:36:05,499 --> 00:36:11,755
My greatest example is my grandparents.

405
00:36:12,923 --> 00:36:15,092
My grandma has arthritis in her hand

406
00:36:15,259 --> 00:36:19,054
and she can't bend down and paint her toenails,

407
00:36:19,179 --> 00:36:21,473
so my grandfather does it for her,

408
00:36:22,975 --> 00:36:24,393
all the time.

409
00:36:27,020 --> 00:36:29,857
Even though he has
arthritis in his hands, too.

410
00:36:35,445 --> 00:36:37,656
So do you like the place?

411
00:36:41,493 --> 00:36:42,911
I like you.

412
00:37:19,698 --> 00:37:23,285
What are you doing?

413
00:37:25,037 --> 00:37:26,413
You can't sleep?

414
00:37:29,333 --> 00:37:31,752
You want to turn on the TV?

415
00:37:43,222 --> 00:37:46,475
How many girls could fall asleep
to the Greater Hartford Open.

416
00:37:46,642 --> 00:37:50,312
Maybe a lot, but this was
the first one I ever met.

417
00:37:59,112 --> 00:38:02,950
I never want to see you back here, never again.
You understand?

418
00:38:06,370 --> 00:38:08,831
I couldn't hide my
condition from her forever.

419
00:38:08,956 --> 00:38:12,167
If I had any chance with Sara,
I had to speed up my recovery.

420
00:38:12,334 --> 00:38:15,087
So I went with another doctor
specialized in a big word

421
00:38:15,212 --> 00:38:18,215
which meant fuck talking, take drugs.

422
00:38:19,049 --> 00:38:22,511
So Dr... Richmond, here's the thing.

423
00:38:23,887 --> 00:38:27,266
I have met and, I think, fallen in
love with the most beautiful,

424
00:38:27,307 --> 00:38:31,812
incredible, weird, woman
on the face of the planet.

425
00:38:33,230 --> 00:38:34,064
And she's so pretty.

426
00:38:34,231 --> 00:38:36,900
She thinks she's a big head,
but she doesn't.

427
00:38:37,025 --> 00:38:40,404
And last night, we consummated
our relationship, which is to say

428
00:38:40,529 --> 00:38:43,949
that I had sex. We had sex.

429
00:38:46,577 --> 00:38:49,705
And it should've felt really good

430
00:38:49,830 --> 00:38:53,292
but I was so focused
on... renouncing the pen I stole,

431
00:38:53,417 --> 00:38:55,210
which she saw me steal, but
I told her I'd returned it

432
00:38:55,377 --> 00:38:57,379
But I didn't return it.
I just stole another pen.

433
00:38:57,421 --> 00:39:00,549
So all that was flying through
my brain when I was supposed to...

434
00:39:00,716 --> 00:39:04,511
So fucking help... help. Fuck!

435
00:39:11,727 --> 00:39:14,146
On a crowded elevator, do you
stand at the back or the front?

436
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:16,106
What?

437
00:39:17,524 --> 00:39:20,319
On a crowded elevator, do you
step at the back or the front?

438
00:39:20,486 --> 00:39:24,781
Back... Front.

439
00:39:28,243 --> 00:39:34,708
Although sometimes I found myself...
looking up at the numbers cause I get nervous.

440
00:39:36,001 --> 00:39:37,711
Do you ever hear voices
coming from your television?

441
00:39:37,878 --> 00:39:41,715
That are not part of the show?
Yeah. - No.

442
00:39:45,719 --> 00:39:48,931
I think we will begin with Divalproic Sodium

443
00:39:49,097 --> 00:39:50,432
What's an Divalproic Sodium?

444
00:39:50,599 --> 00:39:52,935
Technically, an anti-psychotic.

445
00:39:53,060 --> 00:39:54,937
Psychotic? I'm psychotic?

446
00:39:55,062 --> 00:39:55,812
No.

447
00:39:55,979 --> 00:39:58,565
Because I feel psychotic, sometimes.

448
00:39:59,441 --> 00:40:01,443
The fact you are asking the
question proves that you are not.

449
00:40:01,610 --> 00:40:03,529
Then why am I taking psychotic medication?

450
00:40:03,654 --> 00:40:06,081
Because in small doses, it
can be quite helpful with

451
00:40:06,082 --> 00:40:08,325
your mood, which I think is
contributing to your problem.

452
00:40:09,576 --> 00:40:11,495
But I thought that's why I'm on Chlorazipan.

453
00:40:12,621 --> 00:40:14,373
Did someone from Harvard prescribe them?

454
00:40:14,873 --> 00:40:15,916
Yes.

455
00:40:17,084 --> 00:40:17,751
Idiots.

456
00:40:18,252 --> 00:40:19,253
You stop that immediately.

457
00:40:19,378 --> 00:40:21,922
Is this gonna help with
my depersonalization?

458
00:40:22,047 --> 00:40:23,882
That's what we're gonna find out.

459
00:40:24,675 --> 00:40:25,759
Well, what about the side effects?

460
00:40:25,884 --> 00:40:27,803
Nothing to be concerned about.

461
00:40:40,148 --> 00:40:42,192
Have you taken an anti-psychotic before?

462
00:40:42,317 --> 00:40:43,527
No, I'm not psychotic.

463
00:40:43,652 --> 00:40:44,903
I already asked if I'm a psychotic

464
00:40:45,028 --> 00:40:47,030
and apparently that proves
that I'm not psychotic.

465
00:40:47,156 --> 00:40:51,451
I'm taking it for depersonalization.

466
00:40:53,328 --> 00:40:54,872
Are you aware of the side effects?

467
00:40:55,038 --> 00:40:57,332
I was told there is nothing
to be concerned about.

468
00:40:57,875 --> 00:41:02,921
Blurred vision, constipation, dry eyes, dry
nose, dry mouth, difficulty in urinating.

469
00:41:06,300 --> 00:41:08,051
Nothing to be concerned about.

470
00:41:14,558 --> 00:41:17,895
Tardive dyskinesia. A permanent
twitching of the facial muscles.

471
00:41:21,315 --> 00:41:22,232
Fuck.

472
00:41:22,357 --> 00:41:23,442
My alternatives were slim.

473
00:41:23,609 --> 00:41:27,321
Permanent spaciness or
rare irreversible facial twitching.

474
00:42:39,726 --> 00:42:40,477
Where have you been?

475
00:42:42,354 --> 00:42:43,021
What, here?

476
00:42:43,146 --> 00:42:45,190
I've been calling and calling.

477
00:42:46,608 --> 00:42:47,901
What time is it?

478
00:42:48,944 --> 00:42:50,112
It's almost four.

479
00:42:53,782 --> 00:42:55,951
I fell asleep.

480
00:42:57,870 --> 00:42:59,413
I fell asleep in the bathroom.

481
00:43:11,466 --> 00:43:12,551
Hudson, what's going on?

482
00:43:16,388 --> 00:43:17,306
Nothing.

483
00:43:20,475 --> 00:43:21,935
Hudson, tell me what's going on?

484
00:43:22,060 --> 00:43:24,646
Nothing.

485
00:43:24,855 --> 00:43:26,356
I want to know.

486
00:43:32,696 --> 00:43:34,948
The technical term for
it is depersonalization.

487
00:43:35,115 --> 00:43:38,702
But I can't explain to you what
that is because you don't have it.

488
00:43:38,827 --> 00:43:40,871
Can you please try?

489
00:43:46,668 --> 00:43:50,255
It's like when I feel anxious,
which is all the time,

490
00:43:50,380 --> 00:43:55,469
my relationship with
reality is all screwed up.

491
00:44:00,516 --> 00:44:04,853
I look at my hand, and it just doesn't feel...

492
00:44:08,106 --> 00:44:11,068
Like now, I see your lips
moving, and I hear you talking

493
00:44:11,193 --> 00:44:13,403
but it just doesn't feel real to me.

494
00:44:13,570 --> 00:44:15,113
I don't feel real to you?

495
00:44:17,574 --> 00:44:18,700
This all started with the pot.

496
00:44:18,867 --> 00:44:19,785
You think it's the pot?

497
00:44:19,952 --> 00:44:22,246
No, I don't think pot can do that, baby.

498
00:44:24,164 --> 00:44:28,001
Yeah, I don't want to tell you because
I didn't think you'd want to be with me.

499
00:44:28,168 --> 00:44:29,628
Have you seen anybody about this?

500
00:44:29,753 --> 00:44:31,171
I've seen almost everybody about this.

501
00:44:31,338 --> 00:44:32,130
What did they say?

502
00:44:32,256 --> 00:44:34,299
They give me pills, but I don't
think I am taking the right ones,

503
00:44:34,466 --> 00:44:35,843
because they just make me feel worse.

504
00:44:38,929 --> 00:44:42,015
Do you ever feel better?

505
00:44:42,641 --> 00:44:44,059
4:45am

506
00:44:45,394 --> 00:44:48,240
And for the next twenty minutes,
the only time in

507
00:44:48,241 --> 00:44:51,024
this city's day when it
is completely deserted.

508
00:44:52,192 --> 00:44:54,528
I feel that we are the last people on earth.

509
00:44:55,821 --> 00:44:57,573
I wish it was like this all the time.

510
00:45:00,159 --> 00:45:01,910
You can't live like this.

511
00:45:04,663 --> 00:45:06,248
Sometimes I wish I didn't.

512
00:45:16,925 --> 00:45:19,678
I don't think you understand
what he's going through.

513
00:45:21,221 --> 00:45:22,472
I'm afraid for him.

514
00:45:24,224 --> 00:45:25,559
Let me put your mind at ease.

515
00:45:25,684 --> 00:45:30,063
People who talk about killing
themselves very rarely carry it out.

516
00:45:31,190 --> 00:45:32,274
Oh, really?

517
00:45:32,441 --> 00:45:35,152
Because I dated a guy who
talked about it all the time

518
00:45:36,278 --> 00:45:38,989
and then he blew his fucking brains out.

519
00:45:40,782 --> 00:45:44,703
Hudson, you don't mind, I'd like to
speak to Sara alone for a few minutes.

520
00:46:07,976 --> 00:46:10,729
What I'm interested in is why you're here.

521
00:46:14,149 --> 00:46:15,484
Because I care about him.

522
00:46:15,651 --> 00:46:16,693
Why?

523
00:46:21,698 --> 00:46:23,450
Because he does stupid magic tricks.

524
00:46:29,331 --> 00:46:31,416
Because you can't pick
who you fall in love with.

525
00:46:34,795 --> 00:46:36,421
I would never let a girl go to my shrink.

526
00:46:36,547 --> 00:46:38,131
You should've seen her.

527
00:46:38,257 --> 00:46:41,218
She was amazing, she completely defended
me. She really put him in his place.

528
00:46:41,385 --> 00:46:43,011
She knows too much about you now.

529
00:46:43,387 --> 00:46:44,179
So?

530
00:46:45,222 --> 00:46:47,182
Now just a big concern
that she'd use it against you.

531
00:46:47,349 --> 00:46:48,851
For what?

532
00:46:49,852 --> 00:46:50,853
Like a control card.

533
00:46:51,019 --> 00:46:53,146
Whatever she wants, boom, she's got that.

534
00:46:54,148 --> 00:46:55,941
No, Sara would never do that.

535
00:47:01,947 --> 00:47:05,033
OK.
You know what? Ok!

536
00:47:05,159 --> 00:47:06,869
She sounds great.

537
00:47:09,454 --> 00:47:11,665
You want to get some
more done for a few hours?

538
00:47:11,832 --> 00:47:14,960
Yes, I can do that.

539
00:47:16,336 --> 00:47:18,630
After the first round of
individual drug trials failed,

540
00:47:18,839 --> 00:47:22,301
Dr. Richmond decided to bombard
all my neural transmitters at once.

541
00:47:22,467 --> 00:47:26,680
So we combined... everything.

542
00:47:32,102 --> 00:47:35,481
It was like musical drugs and the
music stopped and I couldn't get a chair.

543
00:47:36,231 --> 00:47:37,608
I became numbed at labels.

544
00:47:38,484 --> 00:47:39,902
I just wanted relief.

545
00:47:40,861 --> 00:47:42,613
Good luck with this one, Hudson.

546
00:47:42,779 --> 00:47:44,114
Thanks, Rick.

547
00:48:09,014 --> 00:48:10,724
We have to turn this thing off.

548
00:48:12,434 --> 00:48:14,311
So, one more tournament.

549
00:48:45,968 --> 00:48:47,511
How's your reality system now?

550
00:48:59,231 --> 00:49:00,315
Let's get married.

551
00:49:06,446 --> 00:49:07,489
You're serious?
Yeah.

552
00:49:13,745 --> 00:49:15,998
Hudson, marriage is a
mother-fucker load of responsibility.

553
00:49:16,123 --> 00:49:16,748
I know.

554
00:49:19,084 --> 00:49:19,960
And a lot of work.

555
00:49:20,085 --> 00:49:20,711
I know.

556
00:49:23,463 --> 00:49:24,965
You're not ready to get married.

557
00:49:25,132 --> 00:49:26,300
Yes, I am.

558
00:49:27,885 --> 00:49:31,138
And I want kids, you know, some day.

559
00:49:32,347 --> 00:49:34,099
You think you can do that?

560
00:49:34,266 --> 00:49:35,601
Yes. You don't?

561
00:49:35,767 --> 00:49:37,436
I didn't say that, I just think that maybe

562
00:49:37,561 --> 00:49:40,791
right now is not a good
time to be talking about

563
00:49:40,792 --> 00:49:43,692
marriage when you're
going through this thing.

564
00:49:43,817 --> 00:49:47,488
You can say it, fucked up state of mind,
nobody seems to have a clue what to do with.

565
00:49:48,906 --> 00:49:50,908
But I think you're gonna
work yourself through it.

566
00:49:51,074 --> 00:49:52,451
What if I don't?

567
00:49:54,578 --> 00:49:55,579
You will.

568
00:49:58,582 --> 00:49:59,917
But, what if I don't?

569
00:50:01,793 --> 00:50:04,379
What if this is what I'm gonna
be for the rest of my life?

570
00:50:04,546 --> 00:50:05,797
But I don't think that's the case.

571
00:50:05,923 --> 00:50:09,301
You just need to stop being so...

572
00:50:09,426 --> 00:50:10,219
What?

573
00:50:12,596 --> 00:50:13,472
Negative.

574
00:50:13,639 --> 00:50:14,515
Negative?

575
00:50:14,681 --> 00:50:15,474
Yeah.

576
00:50:17,643 --> 00:50:21,271
Negative. Well, I'm sorry if the rest of the
world was born with perfect brain synapses.

577
00:50:21,396 --> 00:50:26,235
And I'm walking around in la la land, and I
can't tell if this fucking flower is real.

578
00:50:36,119 --> 00:50:41,291
If you are just waiting around
for me to get better, this is it.

579
00:50:43,877 --> 00:50:45,128
This is it.

580
00:51:03,438 --> 00:51:03,981
Tom was right.

581
00:51:04,148 --> 00:51:06,900
In the best of worlds,
all I could bring her was unending grief

582
00:51:07,025 --> 00:51:10,779
and the need for constant reassurance
that I wouldn't lose my mind.

583
00:51:13,198 --> 00:51:15,951
It would only be a matter of time
before she couldn't take it any more.

584
00:51:16,118 --> 00:51:19,872
Self sabotage the best thing in my life?

585
00:51:22,040 --> 00:51:23,667
Of course, I would.

586
00:51:34,386 --> 00:51:34,887
Ready?

587
00:51:43,645 --> 00:51:44,938
What?

588
00:51:49,318 --> 00:51:50,569
You told me you weren't
going to do this again.

589
00:51:50,736 --> 00:51:51,612
I didn't.

590
00:51:51,778 --> 00:51:52,488
Stop it.

591
00:51:52,613 --> 00:51:53,614
Stop what?

592
00:51:54,364 --> 00:51:56,783
I know what you were
trying to do, please don't.

593
00:51:56,950 --> 00:51:58,535
Why? What am I trying to do?

594
00:51:58,660 --> 00:52:00,287
You promised.

595
00:52:00,412 --> 00:52:03,582
Look, this is me.
Alright, it's just me.

596
00:52:03,749 --> 00:52:06,126
You look like a shit.

597
00:52:06,251 --> 00:52:07,211
You wanna end this?

598
00:52:08,545 --> 00:52:11,381
You think you are so irre-fucking-deemable?

599
00:52:12,883 --> 00:52:13,800
Then end it.

600
00:52:15,010 --> 00:52:17,262
Come on, tell me it's over.

601
00:52:18,597 --> 00:52:20,766
But you have to say it.

602
00:52:30,967 --> 00:52:31,967
Fuck!

603
00:53:48,807 --> 00:53:51,399
She didn't do anything.
I did this, I fucked this up, me!

604
00:53:52,524 --> 00:53:56,904
Ok..
just go and apologize.

605
00:53:57,029 --> 00:54:01,450
She deserves a normal person,
not some kleptomaniac freak show.

606
00:54:02,784 --> 00:54:05,037
I asked her to marry me.

607
00:54:06,663 --> 00:54:09,583
What you need now is a
different kind of woman.

608
00:54:09,750 --> 00:54:11,752
Why? So I can just play this shit out again?

609
00:54:14,588 --> 00:54:16,533
Wow, there she is, attractive,

610
00:54:16,534 --> 00:54:18,634
clearly a different woman.

611
00:54:18,800 --> 00:54:19,760
Just go over and talk.

612
00:54:22,012 --> 00:54:23,013
I can't.

613
00:54:23,680 --> 00:54:24,681
Look at me.

614
00:54:25,182 --> 00:54:26,183
I'm your best friend.

615
00:54:34,858 --> 00:54:38,403
Just go and talk, no proposals. Do
not mention the golf channel. Just talk.

616
00:54:39,780 --> 00:54:41,698
Ok, she's on the move, maybe your move now.

617
00:54:43,617 --> 00:54:44,034
Do it!

618
00:54:44,201 --> 00:54:45,536
She's going to the bathroom.

619
00:54:45,661 --> 00:54:47,871
Perfect, go, go.

620
00:55:14,690 --> 00:55:15,524
You're not gonna believe this.

621
00:55:15,649 --> 00:55:19,194
She's a doctor, she specializes
in cognitive behaviorism.

622
00:55:19,319 --> 00:55:20,445
That's incredible.

623
00:55:20,612 --> 00:55:21,822
And she's hot.

624
00:55:26,785 --> 00:55:29,249
Cognitive behaviorism,
the deal was, you can change

625
00:55:29,250 --> 00:55:31,665
the way you felt by altering
your negative thinking.

626
00:55:31,832 --> 00:55:34,334
Will it work? I highly doubted it,

627
00:55:34,459 --> 00:55:36,336
But my god, she was qualified.

628
00:55:36,503 --> 00:55:40,716
Ten years a professor at UCLA,
a Master's in psychology from Stanford.

629
00:55:40,883 --> 00:55:43,141
Another from Cambridge.
Published books on

630
00:55:43,142 --> 00:55:45,721
anxiety, articles in
prestigious medical journals.

631
00:55:45,846 --> 00:55:47,264
Exactly what I needed.

632
00:55:47,431 --> 00:55:52,853
When you say I hate myself for
blowing it with the women of my dreams.

633
00:55:53,020 --> 00:55:55,439
That's an example of magnification.

634
00:55:55,606 --> 00:55:57,900
Or, a better way to express it would be...

635
00:55:58,025 --> 00:56:02,905
at the moment, I am disappointed
that we are no longer together.

636
00:56:03,071 --> 00:56:04,698
But many relationships don't work out.

637
00:56:04,865 --> 00:56:09,286
What can I do to change
my behavior next time?

638
00:56:09,453 --> 00:56:11,747
Are you married?

639
00:56:13,081 --> 00:56:15,918
Now the area we will work on is labeling.

640
00:56:18,921 --> 00:56:22,716
Right, but is there a Mister Doctor Blain?

641
00:56:22,883 --> 00:56:25,344
I don't think that is really
important to your treatment.

642
00:56:29,306 --> 00:56:30,891
Where are you from?

643
00:56:31,016 --> 00:56:33,435
We're not here just to talk about me.

644
00:56:33,602 --> 00:56:38,982
Ok. But it's Texas, right?

645
00:56:41,777 --> 00:56:44,655
Arkansas. OK?

646
00:56:45,656 --> 00:56:49,868
Unlike most therapists, who would never
think of leaving their comfortable offices,

647
00:56:49,993 --> 00:56:52,454
Dr. Blain actually took
her patients into the field.

648
00:56:54,706 --> 00:56:55,833
I can't.

649
00:56:57,251 --> 00:57:03,215
There is absolutely no connection between
saying a word and the health of your father.

650
00:57:04,508 --> 00:57:07,803
Because it will lower your
anxiety and help you get better.

651
00:57:10,681 --> 00:57:12,307
Alright, give me a second.

652
00:57:18,480 --> 00:57:20,065
You can do this, Hudson.

653
00:57:25,571 --> 00:57:26,613
Death.

654
00:57:31,368 --> 00:57:34,872
It worked.
He's ok, he's trimming the hedges.

655
00:57:34,997 --> 00:57:35,956
See?

656
00:57:38,417 --> 00:57:40,669
Has any patient ever asked you out before?

657
00:57:42,546 --> 00:57:43,714
It happens.

658
00:57:43,881 --> 00:57:45,090
Did you ever say yes?

659
00:57:45,215 --> 00:57:47,050
No, never.

660
00:57:47,217 --> 00:57:49,219
How about dinner with me?

661
00:57:49,386 --> 00:57:51,305
I don't think so.

662
00:57:51,430 --> 00:57:54,600
Because we have a professional relationship?

663
00:57:54,725 --> 00:57:55,934
Exactly.

664
00:57:56,059 --> 00:57:58,812
What if I stop seeing you.

665
00:57:58,979 --> 00:58:01,315
I don't think that will be wise.

666
00:58:01,482 --> 00:58:05,277
Right, but what's the
rule on that kind of thing?

667
00:58:06,111 --> 00:58:11,909
You are very sweet, Hudson. But my
only concern is that you get better.

668
00:58:12,075 --> 00:58:14,828
Is that why you blushed back there?

669
00:58:20,542 --> 00:58:22,628
As a way to recovery,
Dr. Blain thought it a good idea

670
00:58:22,753 --> 00:58:26,632
to email me cognitive exercises
so I could practice outside our sessions.

671
00:58:26,798 --> 00:58:30,719
First assignment, monitor
my daily negative thoughts.

672
00:58:59,748 --> 00:59:03,794
Hudson, it's Dr. Blain.
Are you busy?

673
00:59:03,919 --> 00:59:08,173
No, I am just doing
little cognitive homework.

674
00:59:08,340 --> 00:59:11,703
Good, the reason I am
calling is that I found

675
00:59:11,704 --> 00:59:14,847
a very interesting
article on cortisone levels.

676
00:59:15,013 --> 00:59:16,265
I think it may be of some help.

677
00:59:16,431 --> 00:59:19,143
You may want to take a look at it.

678
00:59:20,018 --> 00:59:20,769
Really?

679
00:59:20,894 --> 00:59:24,148
It's like I have it with me now.

680
00:59:24,314 --> 00:59:25,774
Yes, absolutely.

681
00:59:25,941 --> 00:59:30,237
It explains how high cortisone
levels increase the trenolyn

682
00:59:30,404 --> 00:59:35,409
which could have a numb
feeling of depersonalization.

683
00:59:35,576 --> 00:59:36,368
Interesting.

684
00:59:38,412 --> 00:59:41,540
So I'll do some more
reading over the weekend.

685
00:59:41,707 --> 00:59:43,417
Hope I didn't make you drive too far.

686
00:59:43,584 --> 00:59:46,670
No, my shack is only about five minutes away.

687
00:59:46,795 --> 00:59:51,133
Shack? I'm sure it's not a shack.

688
00:59:55,012 --> 00:59:59,641
My god, it is a shack.

689
01:00:00,434 --> 01:00:03,770
Yeah, it is the only place
I feel even close to ok.

690
01:00:07,149 --> 01:00:09,485
Almost like an sanctuary.

691
01:00:12,446 --> 01:00:15,532
I am so sorry this is happening to you.

692
01:00:15,699 --> 01:00:16,992
Thanks.

693
01:00:17,117 --> 01:00:18,160
It's not fair.

694
01:00:18,285 --> 01:00:19,495
Thank you.

695
01:00:22,080 --> 01:00:25,125
And I did blush.

696
01:00:26,668 --> 01:00:28,378
I knew it.

697
01:00:30,214 --> 01:00:36,053
I just think therapeutically it's
important to bring it out in the open.

698
01:00:36,220 --> 01:00:41,642
I do find you very charming,
attractive, and funny.

699
01:00:41,809 --> 01:00:47,189
But things as they are, nothing
can even happen on that level.

700
01:00:47,314 --> 01:00:49,983
I'm sorry.

701
01:00:54,446 --> 01:00:55,697
The door...

702
01:00:55,823 --> 01:00:59,284
Thanks.

703
01:01:16,885 --> 01:01:17,469
Bullshit.

704
01:01:17,636 --> 01:01:20,848
She said it's the first
time she'd sex in seven years.

705
01:01:21,014 --> 01:01:21,974
Bullshit.

706
01:01:22,140 --> 01:01:24,601
It was like having a
wounded animal on top of me.

707
01:01:24,768 --> 01:01:25,769
That's so wrong.

708
01:01:25,936 --> 01:01:27,855
What should I do?

709
01:01:27,980 --> 01:01:29,731
Isn't it obvious?

710
01:01:29,857 --> 01:01:32,401
Try to see her without having to pay.

711
01:01:38,615 --> 01:01:43,620
It is absolutely my fault.
Inexcusable.

712
01:01:43,745 --> 01:01:47,485
I want you to know
that I have spoken to a

713
01:01:47,486 --> 01:01:51,920
colleague to find someone
to take over your sessions.

714
01:01:52,045 --> 01:01:54,173
Who can make me say death?

715
01:01:54,339 --> 01:01:59,511
There is no other way here.
I could lose my license.

716
01:01:59,678 --> 01:02:03,599
I can't see another therapist,
it has to be you.

717
01:02:03,724 --> 01:02:08,353
Hudson, a terrible line has been crossed.

718
01:02:08,479 --> 01:02:13,984
Can't we just forget about
what happened?

719
01:02:20,365 --> 01:02:23,744
You could do that?

720
01:02:23,911 --> 01:02:27,998
Yes.

721
01:02:36,423 --> 01:02:38,008
The first time was exciting,

722
01:02:38,175 --> 01:02:41,303
now having her ride all over me,
I realized that I was letting her use me,

723
01:02:41,428 --> 01:02:44,431
so I could use her so she
worked harder making me better.

724
01:02:44,556 --> 01:02:46,809
I'd become a cognitive whore.

725
01:03:31,854 --> 01:03:37,025
So, is it fresh prune juice and then
death, is that the track record?

726
01:03:37,151 --> 01:03:39,862
Seriously, you still banging that shrink?

727
01:03:39,987 --> 01:03:41,572
I'm afraid to break it off.

728
01:03:41,738 --> 01:03:43,843
She's doing extra research while

729
01:03:43,844 --> 01:03:46,326
she's canceling her appointments
with other patients.

730
01:03:46,451 --> 01:03:47,786
Woo, this is getting bad.

731
01:03:47,911 --> 01:03:49,037
Hudson?

732
01:03:55,210 --> 01:03:57,504
I think we should have some lunch.

733
01:03:57,671 --> 01:03:59,089
What do I do?
Have lunch.

734
01:04:10,476 --> 01:04:15,731
I thought it would be safer to say
what I am about to say in public.

735
01:04:15,856 --> 01:04:19,985
Obviously, something's
happened to my emotions.

736
01:04:20,152 --> 01:04:23,197
My behavior has been... fuck off!

737
01:04:25,240 --> 01:04:27,367
unacceptable.

738
01:04:27,493 --> 01:04:29,244
That can happen.

739
01:04:29,411 --> 01:04:30,829
No, it can't.

740
01:04:30,954 --> 01:04:34,666
Did you witness my tone
with the waiter just then?

741
01:04:34,833 --> 01:04:37,044
I did catch that.

742
01:04:37,211 --> 01:04:41,423
It has to stop, Hudson.
Us, we, this.

743
01:04:41,548 --> 01:04:43,342
I agree.

744
01:04:43,509 --> 01:04:48,263
I was up all night analyzing
my actions, berating myself.

745
01:04:49,848 --> 01:04:51,600
I go to sleep that way every night, so...

746
01:04:51,767 --> 01:04:53,852
Thank you for saying that.
Sure.

747
01:04:55,187 --> 01:04:57,898
I suppose I have spent some many years

748
01:04:58,065 --> 01:05:00,734
listening to other people's feelings that

749
01:05:00,859 --> 01:05:02,694
I've neglected my own.

750
01:05:02,820 --> 01:05:06,698
And it's all coming out now here in the
restaurant in front of all these people?

751
01:05:08,909 --> 01:05:12,871
Which is something I have to
deal with, and I will deal with.

752
01:05:13,956 --> 01:05:15,707
I feel so much better.

753
01:05:17,584 --> 01:05:19,253
God, even my hunger is back.

754
01:05:19,419 --> 01:05:20,379
The tuna looks good.

755
01:05:24,383 --> 01:05:29,304
It's not good, I love you, Hudson.

756
01:05:29,429 --> 01:05:30,347
What?

757
01:05:30,514 --> 01:05:33,642
I love you!

758
01:05:37,980 --> 01:05:41,817
I'm so sorry, I didn't mean
to raise my voice that like.

759
01:05:41,984 --> 01:05:43,902
I though you were dealing with it.

760
01:05:44,069 --> 01:05:48,365
I am, it's just I can't
get you out of my mind.

761
01:05:48,532 --> 01:05:51,660
Sure you can, look at me, I'm a mess,
you don't want that.

762
01:05:51,785 --> 01:05:53,829
I'm flattered that you
think have these feelings.

763
01:05:53,954 --> 01:05:55,956
No, I don't think I have them,

764
01:05:56,081 --> 01:06:02,254
fifteen years of cognitive training, I might just
know a little something about feelings.

765
01:06:06,300 --> 01:06:10,679
God, what is wrong with me.
I'm acting like an insane person.

766
01:06:10,846 --> 01:06:12,264
Will you forgive me?
Yes.

767
01:06:12,431 --> 01:06:13,765
I think we should go.

768
01:06:13,891 --> 01:06:14,933
Sure.

769
01:06:15,100 --> 01:06:17,853
I'll just ask one question.

770
01:06:18,020 --> 01:06:19,354
Can we wait until we get
out of the restaurant?

771
01:06:19,480 --> 01:06:22,232
No, I need to know now.

772
01:06:22,399 --> 01:06:29,031
Do you think under different circumstances
you would feel the same way about me?

773
01:06:29,198 --> 01:06:32,701
I think you need to calm down.

774
01:06:32,826 --> 01:06:38,248
Calm down? I think I know how I am,

775
01:06:38,415 --> 01:06:40,375
and I certainly know how you are.

776
01:06:55,265 --> 01:06:56,558
I love you!

777
01:07:03,482 --> 01:07:04,399
Run!

778
01:07:06,485 --> 01:07:10,364
It just occurred to me I
haven't even met your family.

779
01:07:10,489 --> 01:07:11,782
So how'd it go with the therapist?

780
01:07:16,328 --> 01:07:18,834
Mr. Milbank? This is
the office of Professor

781
01:07:18,835 --> 01:07:20,832
Paula Simon, Mount Sinai
School of Medicine.

782
01:07:20,833 --> 01:07:23,709
We received your enquiry regarding
your depersonalization study.

783
01:07:23,710 --> 01:07:29,758
A spot has become available.
Please contact us at your convenience.

784
01:07:31,385 --> 01:07:33,914
Dr. Paula Simon was
the only doctor in North America

785
01:07:33,915 --> 01:07:36,723
researching depersonalization specifically.

786
01:07:36,849 --> 01:07:40,936
But I was determined to get through
the four day intensive no matter what.

787
01:07:41,103 --> 01:07:44,745
Plus it would be a relief to
finally meet other depersonalized

788
01:07:44,746 --> 01:07:48,068
people as I was beginning
to think I was the only one.

789
01:08:00,080 --> 01:08:00,873
Where are the others?

790
01:08:01,039 --> 01:08:01,832
Others?

791
01:08:01,957 --> 01:08:04,626
Other crazy test patients, like me.

792
01:08:04,751 --> 01:08:06,503
Just you this weekend, sweetheart.

793
01:08:06,628 --> 01:08:10,841
I'll draw your blood for
every hour on the hour for 72 hours.

794
01:08:13,510 --> 01:08:14,845
You're kidding.

795
01:08:14,970 --> 01:08:17,222
That's funny, everyone says that.

796
01:08:17,806 --> 01:08:19,516
You'll see Dr. Simon on Sunday.

797
01:08:20,684 --> 01:08:22,519
I'm the most selfish person in the world.

798
01:08:22,644 --> 01:08:26,857
I blew the best thing that could ever 
happen to me because I was afraid.

799
01:08:29,818 --> 01:08:31,570
I'll see you in an hour.

800
01:08:33,614 --> 01:08:37,951
Count backward from 2004 in groups of 7,

801
01:08:38,160 --> 01:08:40,287
If you make mistake, begin again.

802
01:08:41,580 --> 01:08:46,960
One thousand nine hundred and ninety-seven,
one thousand nine hundred and ninety.

803
01:08:48,921 --> 01:08:51,423
Have any of you guys
ever slept with a patient?

804
01:08:57,721 --> 01:09:00,057
All my attention should have
been at the tests at hand,

805
01:09:00,182 --> 01:09:03,227
but for the first time, I wasn't
thinking about my condition at all.

806
01:09:03,393 --> 01:09:05,521
It was just Sara.

807
01:09:14,571 --> 01:09:18,659
You have depersonalization disorder.

808
01:09:22,037 --> 01:09:25,791
Well, I know that.
How do I get rid of it?

809
01:09:25,916 --> 01:09:27,334
We don't know at this time.

810
01:09:27,501 --> 01:09:29,503
Well, you have to, there's
a great girl involved here.

811
01:09:29,628 --> 01:09:30,879
I've heard.

812
01:09:31,046 --> 01:09:32,256
What about the pot?

813
01:09:32,422 --> 01:09:34,132
Triggered it was all,

814
01:09:34,299 --> 01:09:36,093
it probably would have happened eventually.

815
01:09:36,260 --> 01:09:37,594
But not definitely?

816
01:09:37,719 --> 01:09:40,144
Based on our current research, there was

817
01:09:40,145 --> 01:09:42,933
more than likely
a deficiency there.

818
01:09:43,100 --> 01:09:44,685
So what do I do?

819
01:09:44,852 --> 01:09:45,727
There are medications.

820
01:09:45,853 --> 01:09:46,812
I've taken them all.

821
01:09:46,979 --> 01:09:47,563
And therapies.

822
01:09:47,729 --> 01:09:48,438
I've done them.

823
01:09:48,605 --> 01:09:51,859
Then I suggest you try to accept it.

824
01:09:51,984 --> 01:09:54,319
You suggest I try to accept it?

825
01:09:54,444 --> 01:10:00,909
I do know of an excellent cognitive
behaviorist at UCLA who's been proven helpful.

826
01:10:36,028 --> 01:10:40,657
4.2 cubic feet of space back here.
You won't find that in a Mercedes.

827
01:10:40,824 --> 01:10:42,117
I'll take it.

828
01:10:42,284 --> 01:10:43,118
Very bright and airy.

829
01:10:43,285 --> 01:10:47,331
Beautiful backyard, stunning hardwood
floors. A very pretty yard.

830
01:10:47,498 --> 01:10:48,999
I'll take it.

831
01:11:01,720 --> 01:11:03,138
Tim, Tim, where is she?

832
01:11:04,306 --> 01:11:05,808
She's gone.

833
01:11:05,974 --> 01:11:06,850
What?

834
01:11:06,975 --> 01:11:08,101
She left with some guy.

835
01:11:08,227 --> 01:11:10,145
Where?
Maui.

836
01:11:39,258 --> 01:11:39,883
Which airline?

837
01:11:45,097 --> 01:11:46,098
Delta.

838
01:11:58,402 --> 01:11:59,403
You'll be towed.

839
01:12:24,553 --> 01:12:25,846
Hold on just a second.

840
01:12:29,808 --> 01:12:31,351
Hudson, what are you doing here?

841
01:12:31,477 --> 01:12:35,022
Don't do this. This guy can't
make you swear the way I can.

842
01:12:35,147 --> 01:12:36,690
Go home.

843
01:12:36,815 --> 01:12:38,650
Home to what?

844
01:12:38,817 --> 01:12:40,611
You're the only one I can be myself around.

845
01:12:40,777 --> 01:12:42,863
You are the only one I
can be comfortable with.

846
01:12:43,030 --> 01:12:49,161
I bought you a new house, and a
car, and I'm getting a smaller TV.

847
01:12:49,286 --> 01:12:52,539
Hudson, it's not about a house, or car, or TV.

848
01:12:52,706 --> 01:12:54,875
Ok, how about this?
I love you.

849
01:12:57,336 --> 01:12:59,546
Don't say that.

850
01:13:00,756 --> 01:13:03,217
You can save me,
but you won't even try.

851
01:13:07,918 --> 01:13:08,918
Sara.

852
01:13:12,351 --> 01:13:13,018
Let's go.

853
01:13:37,019 --> 01:13:38,019
Hello.

854
01:14:32,264 --> 01:14:34,766
Can we talk?

855
01:14:36,185 --> 01:14:37,519
Oh, I'm busy.

856
01:14:39,313 --> 01:14:41,273
Our dad just died and you are
doing business on the phone?

857
01:14:41,398 --> 01:14:43,150
It's nothing, it's just my brother, go ahead.

858
01:14:43,275 --> 01:14:45,694
You won't get off the phone.

859
01:14:49,031 --> 01:14:50,824
What the hell is wrong with you?

860
01:15:12,513 --> 01:15:16,642
Hudson, what are you doing?

861
01:15:16,767 --> 01:15:17,643
Nothing.

862
01:15:21,063 --> 01:15:22,981
What happened with you and brother?

863
01:15:23,106 --> 01:15:24,233
Doesn't matter.

864
01:15:24,358 --> 01:15:25,818
That's what he said.

865
01:15:25,943 --> 01:15:28,779
He wants to be downstairs with the others.

866
01:15:31,156 --> 01:15:35,869
Would you stop that?
Would you stop that?

867
01:15:37,621 --> 01:15:38,705
God damn it.

868
01:15:42,042 --> 01:15:43,752
What's wrong with you?

869
01:15:43,919 --> 01:15:46,421
Why have you always been so angry at me?

870
01:15:46,588 --> 01:15:47,798
Are you kidding?

871
01:15:47,923 --> 01:15:52,094
You know they say the first three years
of a child's life is the most essential.

872
01:15:52,261 --> 01:15:56,515
I'm just curious. Were you bouncing
me on my head during that time?

873
01:15:56,682 --> 01:15:59,059
I'd really love to know
how I turned out this way.

874
01:15:59,226 --> 01:16:03,272
Well, it wasn't easy for me either.

875
01:16:03,438 --> 01:16:07,401
Hudson, do you have any idea
what a selfish boy you were?

876
01:16:07,568 --> 01:16:10,195
I was a kid.
Kids are supposed to be selfish.

877
01:16:10,320 --> 01:16:14,950
Ok, fine. I was a terrible mother.
Is that what you want to hear?

878
01:16:15,117 --> 01:16:17,494
Yeah, that's what I want to hear.

879
01:16:36,555 --> 01:16:41,768
I always... loved you children.

880
01:16:41,894 --> 01:16:49,276
But, you and I... were the most alike.

881
01:16:57,576 --> 01:16:59,620
Well that's certainly true.

882
01:17:01,538 --> 01:17:06,043
Maybe I wasn't as nurturing
as I should have been.

883
01:17:11,798 --> 01:17:16,637
That must have been very hard for you to say.

884
01:17:37,407 --> 01:17:38,784
My theory was simple

885
01:17:38,951 --> 01:17:40,744
If smoking marijuana triggered my problem,

886
01:17:40,911 --> 01:17:42,663
smoking even more would reverse it.

887
01:17:42,830 --> 01:17:45,499
Shocking my synapses back to normal.

888
01:17:46,333 --> 01:17:47,084
There's no science behind this,

889
01:17:47,251 --> 01:17:50,337
just a gutsy feeling out of sheer desperation.

890
01:17:50,504 --> 01:17:53,507
Was I scared? Absolutely.

891
01:17:53,674 --> 01:17:55,717
Would it work?
It had to.

892
01:18:15,218 --> 01:18:16,218
You're OK.

893
01:18:56,719 --> 01:18:57,719
God, no.

894
01:19:03,410 --> 01:19:05,286
I needed a quick fix of manic adrenalin

895
01:19:05,287 --> 01:19:07,498
to snap me back into a
resemblance of reality.

896
01:19:07,623 --> 01:19:09,291
Hell, I deserved it.

897
01:19:09,416 --> 01:19:12,085
And I knew just the remedy.

898
01:20:10,435 --> 01:20:11,854
What are you staring at?

899
01:20:21,780 --> 01:20:24,408
Probably best to keep a low key around here.

900
01:20:28,871 --> 01:20:31,039
So, what did you do?

901
01:20:31,915 --> 01:20:36,044
Shoplifted a pair of Air Soles.

902
01:20:36,420 --> 01:20:37,921
Good shoes.

903
01:20:42,009 --> 01:20:44,428
What did you do?

904
01:20:44,595 --> 01:20:47,556
Nothing.

905
01:20:47,681 --> 01:20:51,268
And they don't like that.

906
01:20:56,857 --> 01:20:58,358
Hey, it's gonna be ok.

907
01:20:58,525 --> 01:21:00,402
No, it's not.

908
01:21:00,569 --> 01:21:02,112
I miss Sara.

909
01:21:05,449 --> 01:21:07,493
I don't think I can be a writer anymore.

910
01:21:07,618 --> 01:21:09,786
and I'm completely alone.

911
01:21:16,418 --> 01:21:18,378
Do I look familiar to you?

912
01:21:22,132 --> 01:21:27,054
I've passed you and your dog
outside the grocery store 100 times?

913
01:21:28,013 --> 01:21:31,683
100 times, and I never gave you anything.

914
01:21:31,934 --> 01:21:33,393
I know.

915
01:21:36,605 --> 01:21:40,234
Look, I'll wait here with you.

916
01:22:16,311 --> 01:22:18,355
Maybe Dr. Simon was right.

917
01:22:18,480 --> 01:22:21,233
Maybe I had a predisposition all long.

918
01:22:21,400 --> 01:22:24,403
The pot was the just an
easy excuse to pin it on.

919
01:22:24,528 --> 01:22:27,239
Maybe it was just me.

920
01:22:27,739 --> 01:22:29,074
I was my problem.

921
01:22:30,492 --> 01:22:31,743
Maybe my dad had it right.

922
01:22:32,828 --> 01:22:35,747
Just pull up my socks
and get out my own way.

923
01:22:50,748 --> 01:22:51,748
Hi.
Hello

924
01:22:52,222 --> 01:22:53,807
I'm here to tell you I love you.

925
01:22:53,974 --> 01:22:58,812
Even though I know you're gonna say "ya, so?"
I still love you.

926
01:23:02,608 --> 01:23:03,233
Ok.

927
01:23:03,650 --> 01:23:04,693
See you.

928
01:23:08,280 --> 01:23:11,116
Hudson, I think you are making a big mistake.

929
01:23:11,283 --> 01:23:16,079
We need to have a session to
discuss you ending your sessions.

930
01:23:16,205 --> 01:23:18,457
This is your brain chemistry talking.

931
01:23:18,582 --> 01:23:21,001
There are new medications
coming out all the time.

932
01:23:21,002 --> 01:23:22,002
This should square us up.

933
01:23:44,483 --> 01:23:45,526
This your first time?

934
01:23:47,569 --> 01:23:48,779
I'll wait with you.

935
01:23:58,872 --> 01:24:01,291
Oh my god, you are so late.

936
01:24:01,458 --> 01:24:05,003
Hudson Milbank. God, you are so late.

937
01:24:29,153 --> 01:24:30,028
Sorry I'm late.

938
01:24:30,195 --> 01:24:31,864
No problem.

939
01:24:33,157 --> 01:24:35,242
We understand that you came by in the room

940
01:24:35,409 --> 01:24:37,327
and my partner is very excited about that.

941
01:24:37,494 --> 01:24:40,664
So excited that we worked really
hard for the last a couple of weeks

942
01:24:40,789 --> 01:24:43,375
to come up with something
great for you to hear today.

943
01:24:44,418 --> 01:24:45,460
Well, that's not true.

944
01:24:45,627 --> 01:24:46,628
He's been working really work.

945
01:24:46,753 --> 01:24:50,591
So he's the writer.
He's a really good writer.

946
01:24:52,759 --> 01:24:55,179
The only thing that I'm really good
at is bullshitting all of you guys.

947
01:24:55,304 --> 01:24:57,431
and that's just not enough
for me to be good at anymore.

948
01:24:57,598 --> 01:24:59,516
So I'm gonna go.

949
01:25:01,310 --> 01:25:04,229
Yeah, I'm gonna go.
Tom will take this home for you.

950
01:25:04,354 --> 01:25:05,981
I'll put your name first.

951
01:26:30,982 --> 01:26:31,982
Hi.
Hi.

952
01:26:34,278 --> 01:26:35,279
How are you?

953
01:26:35,404 --> 01:26:37,156
I'm good.
Good.

954
01:26:39,283 --> 01:26:40,617
How are you?

955
01:26:40,742 --> 01:26:43,203
I'm good. I'm better.

956
01:26:43,328 --> 01:26:47,958
I'm not gonna be normal.

957
01:26:48,208 --> 01:26:51,879
I'm still more comfortable at 4:45am
at the corner of Insure and Woodmen.

958
01:26:56,258 --> 01:26:57,342
Look, I don't want to hold you up.

959
01:26:57,509 --> 01:26:58,385
I just want you to know that

960
01:26:58,510 --> 01:27:01,096
even if you lost all your limbs,
we'd still be together forever.

961
01:27:03,348 --> 01:27:04,808
I mean I really hope that doesn't happen

962
01:27:04,933 --> 01:27:10,063
because I think your limbs are... pretty great.

963
01:27:11,815 --> 01:27:15,527
And when I say your name,
it would always sound safe.

964
01:27:19,198 --> 01:27:21,617
I'm not sure about the
perfume, that cologne thing.

965
01:27:21,783 --> 01:27:22,534
But I can try.

966
01:27:22,659 --> 01:27:24,328
You know, I can pick some up.

967
01:27:27,414 --> 01:27:30,125
I will try to make you
smile when you are tired.

968
01:27:30,250 --> 01:27:31,668
I know you think that's really hard to do.

969
01:27:31,793 --> 01:27:34,546
But I think I could do that.

970
01:27:38,717 --> 01:27:42,387
And you'd never have to be
scared to tell me anything.

971
01:27:44,723 --> 01:27:46,517
And if you like this shirt,

972
01:27:46,683 --> 01:27:48,685
I won't take it off for a month.

973
01:27:52,189 --> 01:27:55,025
And I'd be more than willing
to paint your grandmother's toenails

974
01:27:55,150 --> 01:27:57,778
so that your grandfather
won't have to do that anymore.

975
01:28:03,158 --> 01:28:05,869
You don't have to save me, Sara.

976
01:28:06,036 --> 01:28:08,956
But I'm gonna love you
for the rest of my life.

977
01:28:09,081 --> 01:28:14,586
So things will be a lot
better for me if you're around.

978
01:28:34,587 --> 01:28:35,587
Ok.

979
01:32:14,587 --> 01:32:15,587
