Thank you.

40
00:06:48,534 --> 00:06:51,745
Good morning, Sister Lucia.

41
00:06:51,787 --> 00:06:56,083
Of Jesus
and of the Immaculate Heart.

42
00:06:56,124 --> 00:06:57,417
Yes.

43
00:06:59,586 --> 00:07:02,297
Thank you for taking the time
to meet me today.

44
00:07:02,339 --> 00:07:03,757
I really appreciate it.

45
00:07:05,133 --> 00:07:08,470
[sighs] I couldn't imagine my book
completed without you.

46
00:07:08,512 --> 00:07:12,808
I just read and very much appreciated
your last work.

47
00:07:12,850 --> 00:07:14,142
- Thank you.
- Although...

48
00:07:15,519 --> 00:07:17,980
I don't share most of your views.

49
00:07:18,021 --> 00:07:20,315
No, I suppose you do not.

50
00:07:20,357 --> 00:07:25,654
In your last paper, you wrote,
"All seers are de facto unstable."

51
00:07:25,696 --> 00:07:27,739
I didn't mean to offend you.

52
00:07:27,781 --> 00:07:31,368
On the contrary,
I've always been fascinated

53
00:07:31,410 --> 00:07:35,122
by opinions opposed to my own.

54
00:07:35,163 --> 00:07:37,082
Well, then we do have
something in common.

55
00:07:39,168 --> 00:07:41,712
I have so many questions,
Sister Lucia.

56
00:07:42,921 --> 00:07:45,465
But let me start
with the most obvious one.

57
00:07:45,507 --> 00:07:48,135
If someone were to say to you now

58
00:07:48,844 --> 00:07:51,680
why what happened
all those years ago

59
00:07:51,722 --> 00:07:54,183
had to have happened to you
of all people...

60
00:07:55,225 --> 00:07:56,810
how would you respond?

61
00:07:57,978 --> 00:08:00,147
Because it was necessary.

62
00:08:01,690 --> 00:08:02,941
Necessary?

63
00:08:02,983 --> 00:08:05,110
To spread her message.

64
00:08:06,987 --> 00:08:09,031
At the time, naturally,

65
00:08:09,948 --> 00:08:14,494
I could not have imagined
its importance

66
00:08:14,536 --> 00:08:16,163
nor the consequences.

67
00:08:20,584 --> 00:08:21,877
I was a child.

68
00:08:26,423 --> 00:08:28,008
And do you have any regrets?

69
00:08:31,803 --> 00:08:36,015
Does it look like the world
has heard the message of heavenly peace?

70
00:08:36,558 --> 00:08:37,808
Hmm.

71
00:08:39,645 --> 00:08:41,355
This is my only regret.

72
00:08:42,688 --> 00:08:45,359
That I haven't done enough
to please my mother.

73
00:08:47,027 --> 00:08:48,195
Which mother?

74
00:08:49,988 --> 00:08:51,156
The Holy Mother?

75
00:08:53,992 --> 00:08:56,662

00:10:47,064 --> 00:10:51,443
I promise I will work
much harder for the church

and to spread faith.

106
00:10:54,863 --> 00:10:55,989
As a family...

107
00:10:57,824 --> 00:10:59,993
we are to carry out many penances.

108
00:11:00,827 --> 00:11:03,664
Our home will be an example
for the church.

What are you doing here?

125
00:12:14,151 --> 00:12:16,361
I told him to go

Ah. Good girl.

138
00:13:12,876 --> 00:13:14,920
We must be proud of them.

139
00:13:14,962 --> 00:13:18,632
These young men are fighting
to keep our country's honor high.

140
00:13:19,716 --> 00:13:22,052
But they also defend our republic.

141
00:13:22,094 --> 00:13:24,096
They defend our progressive ideas

142
00:13:24,137 --> 00:13:26,223
that will free our country
from a feudal past

143
00:13:26,265 --> 00:13:28,934
created by ignorance
and religious superstitions.

144
00:13:30,978 --> 00:13:35,107
We must all follow the example
of Nuno and Ernesto.

145
00:13:39,361 --> 00:13:42,906
Your Lenten fast is over, isn't it?
Let us make a toast to their honor.

146
00:13:42,948 --> 00:13:45,367
Joaquim, I'm buying a round of drinks

- Lucia, come with me.
- Why?

151
00:14:09,349 --> 00:14:13,312
I told you this morning.
It's time we pray and ask for forgiveness.

152
00:14:14,146 --> 00:14:15,480
She was only dancing.

153
00:14:15,522 --> 00:14:18,233
We promised the Holy Virgin,
for Manuel.

154
00:14:19,526 --> 00:14:21,737
I don't think either God
or the Holy Virgin

155
00:14:21,778 --> 00:14:25,073
will be upset
if a young girl is dancing.

156
00:14:26,450 --> 00:14:29,995
I promised we'd be sacrificing ourselves
to get him home.

157
00:14:36,376 --> 00:14:37,461
Yeah.

158
00:14:46,386 --> 00:14:48,889
Francisco. Come and dance. Come.

159
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:56,522

Lucia! Lucia!

163
00:15:50,284 --> 00:15:52,286
We brought you a treat!

164
00:15:52,327 --> 00:15:54,955
I was hoping you'd come.
I'm starving.

165
00:15:55,622 --> 00:15:59,501
But... my mother says
a little hunger is good for the soul.

166
00:15:59,543 --> 00:16:00,961
Especially now.

167
00:16:01,003 --> 00:16:02,963
Is Auntie still angry with you?

168
00:16:03,964 --> 00:16:06,758
You did nothing wrong.
You were only dancing.

169
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:08,468
Yes, I know that.

170
00:16:08,510 --> 00:16:11,138
But Mama is scared for Manuel.

171
00:16:11,180 --> 00:16:13,182
What does that
have to do with you?

172
00:16:14,516 --> 00:16:17,269
Mama says I must atone
to make him come home.

173
00:16:21,106 --> 00:16:22,816
[Francisco] Come on, let's go.

174
00:16:23,317 --> 00:16:25,861
Let's pray like we did last time!

175
00:16:28,113 --> 00:16:30,240

176
00:16:37,164 --> 00:16:39,166

[echoing]

180
00:16:49,635 --> 00:16:50,928
How many did you hear?

181
00:16:51,678 --> 00:16:53,013
I don't know. Maybe three.

182
00:16:55,724 --> 00:16:58,852
[echoing] Ave!

183
00:16:59,311 --> 00:17:02,314
- Maria!
- Maria!

184
00:17:03,690 --> 00:17:06,609
- [loud thunderclap]
- Did you see that?

185
00:17:06,652 --> 00:17:07,819
- What?
- Was it lightning?

186
00:17:07,861 --> 00:17:09,530
We must go. It's going to rain.

187
00:17:10,196 --> 00:17:11,823
But the sun is shining.

188
00:17:11,865 --> 00:17:14,409
- Help me gather the sheep.
- But I didn't see any lightning.

189
00:17:14,451 --> 00:17:16,453
[thunder rumbling]

190
00:17:18,163 --> 00:17:19,580
[laughing]

191
00:17:25,002 --> 00:17:26,713
[laughter continues]

192
00:17:27,256 --> 00:17:28,966
[sheep bleating]

193
00:17:29,007 --> 00:17:30,968
Come on.
[Portuguese]

194
00:17:31,009 --> 00:17:33,178
Come on! Come on!
We have to go home!

195
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:35,305
- Come on. Let's go.
- Let's go home.

196
00:17:35,347 --> 00:17:36,723
Come on, let's go home.

197
00:17:36,765 --> 00:17:37,891
- Let's go!
- We need to go!

198
00:17:37,933 --> 00:17:40,435
- [thunder continues rumbling]
- Another one.

199
00:17:44,147 --> 00:17:46,233
[insects buzzing]

200
00:17:47,734 --> 00:17:49,486
[thunder subsides]

201
00:18:07,671 --> 00:18:09,423
[wind howling]

202
00:18:20,642 --> 00:18:21,810
[grunts]

203
00:18:26,231 --> 00:18:27,232
Look.

204
00:18:30,110 --> 00:18:31,111
[gasps]

205
00:18:46,793 --> 00:18:49,796
Who are you?
Where do you come from?

206
00:18:50,964 --> 00:18:52,299
Who are you talking to?

207
00:18:52,341 --> 00:18:54,843
- [girl] Can't you see her?
- [Francisco] No.

208
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:57,095
- Enough of this joke.
- Shh!

209
00:19:00,182 --> 00:19:01,642
I come from heaven.

210
00:19:06,063 --> 00:19:08,148
Are you seriously from heaven?

211
00:19:08,190 --> 00:19:09,816
Will I go to heaven?

212
00:19:13,737 --> 00:19:15,322
I can see her now.

213
00:19:16,990 --> 00:19:18,283
What about Jacinta?

214
00:19:19,201 --> 00:19:20,327
[woman] Also.

215
00:19:21,703 --> 00:19:23,956
- [Lucia] And Francisco?
- What?

216
00:19:23,997 --> 00:19:25,165
[woman] Same. But...

217
00:19:25,749 --> 00:19:27,417
[no audible dialogue]

218
00:19:30,337 --> 00:19:31,630
What did she say?

219
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:36,343
I'll tell you later.

220
00:19:39,137 --> 00:19:41,557
Our friend, Maria Das Neves.

221
00:19:42,808 --> 00:19:44,059
She's in heaven.

222
00:19:51,650 --> 00:19:55,028
Why did you come?
What do you want from us?

223
00:19:57,698 --> 00:19:59,825
You must come back here,

224
00:20:00,701 --> 00:20:03,704
every month at this time,

225
00:20:03,745 --> 00:20:06,123
for the next six months.

226
00:20:13,547 --> 00:20:16,300
Pray the rosary every day...

227
00:20:17,384 --> 00:20:19,803
to bring peace to the world...

228
00:20:21,221 --> 00:20:23,182
and to end the war.

229
00:20:25,726 --> 00:20:28,228
The world needs peace.

230
00:20:43,243 --> 00:20:45,537
I want to know
what she said about me.

231
00:21:09,645 --> 00:21:11,563
[bleating]

232
00:21:21,615 --> 00:21:23,825
Did you tell her
about the rosary?

233
00:21:23,867 --> 00:21:25,160
No.

234
00:21:25,202 --> 00:21:28,372
So, she said
I need to pray the rosary more.

235
00:21:28,413 --> 00:21:32,584
She knows everything,
even our most personal things.

236
00:21:32,626 --> 00:21:34,461
Are you sure
she's not angry at me?

237
00:21:34,503 --> 00:21:38,006
I told you not to throw stones
at the boys from Boleiros.

238
00:21:38,048 --> 00:21:40,676
Do you think that's the reason
why I couldn't hear her?

239
00:21:40,717 --> 00:21:42,594
- Sure it is.
- But they beat me up.

240
00:21:42,636 --> 00:21:44,638
- I try to run away...
- Stop it.

241
00:21:47,391 --> 00:21:49,977
So, what do we do now?

242
00:21:51,019 --> 00:21:53,105
She said we have to suffer.

243
00:21:53,814 --> 00:21:54,815
Why?

244
00:21:55,649 --> 00:21:58,193
I didn't quite understand.

245
00:21:58,610 --> 00:22:00,696
What are we doing wrong?

246
00:22:05,117 --> 00:22:07,744
I can't wait
to tell Mama and Papa.

247
00:22:07,786 --> 00:22:09,204
- We can't tell anyone!
- We can't tell anyone!

248
00:22:09,997 --> 00:22:12,416
But she said
we were her messengers.

249
00:22:12,457 --> 00:22:16,670
She came to us.
It's our secret.

250
00:22:18,964 --> 00:22:20,841
[bleating]

251
00:22:26,972 --> 00:22:29,933
It is a sin
to use God's name in vain.

252
00:22:29,975 --> 00:22:32,144
Do I need to say
making lies up?

253
00:22:32,186 --> 00:22:34,521
- Give her time to explain.
- Forgive me.

254
00:22:35,063 --> 00:22:38,025
I didn't mean to tell them, but...

255
00:22:38,066 --> 00:22:39,151
But it's true, Mama.

256
00:22:40,777 --> 00:22:42,321
She was so beautiful.

257
00:22:43,322 --> 00:22:45,032
And as real as you are.

258
00:22:46,241 --> 00:22:48,327
She was sad about the war.

259
00:22:49,328 --> 00:22:51,830
But she said
she loves us so much.

260
00:22:51,872 --> 00:22:55,042
And she'll be back every month
around midday.

261
00:22:56,043 --> 00:22:58,962
It wasn't just me who saw her.
We all did.

262
00:23:00,172 --> 00:23:02,966
Yes, but I couldn't hear her though.

263
00:23:03,008 --> 00:23:05,052
What if they are telling the truth?

264
00:23:08,472 --> 00:23:09,556
The truth?

265
00:23:10,724 --> 00:23:12,476
How can you be so sure?

266
00:23:13,477 --> 00:23:16,188
A few days ago,
Lucy said she'd seen an angel,

267
00:23:16,230 --> 00:23:17,689
and Manuel wounded.

268
00:23:17,731 --> 00:23:19,650
Auntie, it is the truth.

269
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:21,735
We saw her.

270
00:23:22,528 --> 00:23:24,530
And we didn't imagine it.

271
00:23:26,615 --> 00:23:30,494
Hmm. Did she say
she was the Holy Virgin?

272
00:23:30,536 --> 00:23:32,538
She came from heaven.

273
00:23:33,372 --> 00:23:34,831
- Did she say that?
- [Lucia] No.

274
00:23:34,873 --> 00:23:36,625
She did not say who she was.

275
00:23:37,584 --> 00:23:39,670
- It could have been someone else.
- It was her.

276
00:23:39,711 --> 00:23:43,090
Why would the Mother of God
choose you of all people?

277
00:23:44,049 --> 00:23:46,218
- What's so special about you?
- [man] Maria.

278
00:23:46,260 --> 00:23:47,970
How can she be
so full of herself?

279
00:23:48,804 --> 00:23:52,015
António, you don't understand.
At first, it was an angel.

280
00:23:52,057 --> 00:23:54,726
And then Manuel.
Now it's the Mother of God.

281
00:23:57,104 --> 00:23:59,189
She must stop lying
just to get our attention.

282
00:23:59,231 --> 00:24:00,691
I'm not lying!

283
00:24:01,608 --> 00:24:04,903
[thunder rumbling, faint]

284
00:24:12,077 --> 00:24:14,162
But maybe...

285
00:24:18,083 --> 00:24:19,126
I don't know.

286
00:24:19,168 --> 00:24:20,460
She was real.

287
00:24:22,171 --> 00:24:23,755
Lucia. Lucia!

288
00:24:23,797 --> 00:24:25,048
Wait, wait, wait.

289
00:24:25,090 --> 00:24:28,969
- [door opens]
- [hinge creaks]

290
00:24:29,011 --> 00:24:31,638
It's getting late. We better go.

291
00:24:32,723 --> 00:24:34,558
It's all my fault.
I shouldn't have read

292
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:37,519
<i>The Virgin's Appearance
to the Little Shepherds of Salette.</i>

293
00:24:38,645 --> 00:24:39,813
[António] Good night.

294
00:24:39,855 --> 00:24:41,398
[children] Good night.

295
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:44,026
[thunder continues rumbling]

296
00:24:44,067 --> 00:24:45,194
Jacinta, wait.

297
00:24:50,991 --> 00:24:52,826
- Good night.
- Good night.

298
00:25:05,506 --> 00:25:07,132
[Maria] Francisco, Jacinta.

299
00:25:15,265 --> 00:25:17,434
[Lucia] Jacinta, who is younger than me...

300
00:25:18,352 --> 00:25:19,895
was much braver.

301
00:25:20,729 --> 00:25:23,649
Please forgive me. I was scared.

302
00:25:25,025 --> 00:25:27,027
I really want to see you again.

303
00:25:33,116 --> 00:25:35,786
Lucia, is everything all right?

304
00:26:00,102 --> 00:26:01,353
Do you believe them?

305
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:08,110
I wouldn't know.

306
00:26:10,863 --> 00:26:12,197
[sighs]

307
00:26:14,032 --> 00:26:15,534
They've never told lies.

308
00:26:27,963 --> 00:26:29,715
[door opens]

309
00:26:30,424 --> 00:26:32,467
Thank you. Oh, Father.

310
00:26:32,509 --> 00:26:35,053
Thank you so much
for getting in touch with me.

311
00:26:35,095 --> 00:26:37,097
Lucia told me everything.

312
00:26:38,891 --> 00:26:42,936
Forgive me, Father.
I don't know what happened to Lucia.

313
00:26:42,978 --> 00:26:47,357
She's always had a bright imagination,
but she seems to have gone too far.

314
00:26:47,399 --> 00:26:49,985
And I've already told you,
it is a sin to tell lies.

315
00:26:50,027 --> 00:26:51,445
It goes against God.

316
00:26:52,196 --> 00:26:54,281
Now tell the truth
and ask for forgiveness.

317
00:26:54,323 --> 00:26:57,576
It is no lie. We saw her.

318
00:26:57,618 --> 00:26:59,912
And she told us to come back
to see her again.

319
00:26:59,953 --> 00:27:02,581
When is this going to end?
I'm sorry.

320
00:27:03,457 --> 00:27:04,958
Why don't we agree for now

321
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:08,337
and accept that what you are saying
is the truth?

322
00:27:09,630 --> 00:27:13,425
How can you be so sure
that the lady you saw was the Virgin Mary?

323
00:27:16,261 --> 00:27:17,930
I just do.

324
00:27:18,931 --> 00:27:24,019
[sighs] You know, Lucia, someone may
have wanted to play a trick on you.

325
00:27:25,646 --> 00:27:28,607
Or worse.
It could have been the devil.

326
00:27:29,149 --> 00:27:32,903
Sometimes the devil likes to tempt
young souls like yours.

327
00:27:32,945 --> 00:27:34,780
He often disguises himself,

328
00:27:34,821 --> 00:27:37,616
at times even through
reassuring shapes,

329
00:27:37,658 --> 00:27:39,326
as a way to hide his evil.

330
00:27:41,662 --> 00:27:43,205
Thank you, Father.

331
00:27:43,247 --> 00:27:44,331
Excuse me.

332
00:27:45,666 --> 00:27:48,085
It would be wise
to forbid Lucia and her cousins

333
00:27:48,126 --> 00:27:49,545
to return to that place.

334
00:27:50,754 --> 00:27:52,881
Do you really think
she had a vision of the devil?

335
00:27:53,841 --> 00:27:56,343
Even if it was a figment
of her imagination...

336
00:27:57,344 --> 00:27:59,972
if word gets out,
considering the time we live in,

337
00:28:00,013 --> 00:28:01,849
it could be dangerous.

338
00:28:01,890 --> 00:28:05,102
Anything related to religion
is ill-received by many.

339
00:28:06,019 --> 00:28:07,020
[Maria] Thank you, Father.

340
00:28:07,646 --> 00:28:09,690
Come on. Let's go home.

341
00:28:14,987 --> 00:28:16,363
[door hinge creaking]

342
00:28:28,292 --> 00:28:30,377
[faint whispering]

343
00:28:38,844 --> 00:28:40,721
[whispering continues]

344
00:28:40,762 --> 00:28:42,764
[rapid breathing]

345
00:28:46,226 --> 00:28:47,853
[distant scream]

346
00:28:47,895 --> 00:28:49,396
[gasps]

347
00:29:02,492 --> 00:29:03,952
[female voice] Lucia.

348
00:29:10,083 --> 00:29:11,293
Is it you?

349
00:29:12,461 --> 00:29:14,087
[female voice] Come here.

350
00:29:33,106 --> 00:29:35,567
[rattling]

351
00:29:35,609 --> 00:29:37,986
- [hisses]
- [gasps]

352
00:30:24,449 --> 00:30:27,494
[female voice] <i>Hail Mary, full of grace.
The Lord is with thee.</i>

353
00:30:27,536 --> 00:30:29,955
<i>Hail Mary, full of grace.
The Lord is with thee.</i>

354
00:30:38,547 --> 00:30:39,840
<i>Hail Mary, full of grace.</i>

355
00:30:39,882 --> 00:30:43,427
<i>Hail Mary, full of grace.
The Lord is with thee.</i>

356
00:30:43,468 --> 00:30:45,304
<i>Blessed art thou amongst women,</i>

357
00:30:45,345 --> 00:30:47,681
<i>and blessed is the fruit
of thy womb, O Jesus.</i>

358
00:30:48,348 --> 00:30:49,850
<i>Hail Mary, full of grace.</i>

359
00:30:49,892 --> 00:30:52,728
<i>Holy Mary, Mother of God,
pray for us sinners,</i>

360
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:56,899
<i>now and in the hour of our death. Amen.</i>

- [dog barking]
- [sheep bleating]

362
00:31:04,323 --> 00:31:08,035
<i>Hail Mary, full of grace.
The Lord is with thee.</i>

363
00:31:12,623 --> 00:31:15,626
[bell tolling]

364
00:31:24,593 --> 00:31:26,637
[Nichols] <i>Have you ever asked yourself</i>

365
00:31:26,678 --> 00:31:29,556
<i>why do the divinities
who appear in apparitions</i>

366
00:31:29,598 --> 00:31:34,144
<i>always match the traditional iconography
of the culture in which they appear?</i>

367
00:31:36,897 --> 00:31:39,024
<i>This is certainly true in your case,</i>

368
00:31:39,066 --> 00:31:41,860
<i>as it has been
for nearly all religious apparitions.</i>

369
00:31:41,902 --> 00:31:43,570
<i>Doesn't that seem strange to you?</i>

370
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:46,281
[Lucia] <i>No.</i>

371
00:31:49,868 --> 00:31:52,746
If I follow your logic,
there are multiple divinities.

372
00:31:53,580 --> 00:31:58,961
Or it is the unconscious that translates
each person's desire to meet the divine

373
00:31:59,002 --> 00:32:01,421
in images that belong
to their particular culture.

374
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:05,551
You call it the unconscious.

375
00:32:06,927 --> 00:32:08,220
I call Him God.

376
00:32:08,887 --> 00:32:11,056
Who, in His infinite wisdom,

377
00:32:11,098 --> 00:32:16,395
manifests Himself
in a form that we expect,

378
00:32:16,436 --> 00:32:20,357
in order to help us
understand better.

379
00:32:20,399 --> 00:32:23,569
So you believe that it is God
that chose the wrong position

380
00:32:23,610 --> 00:32:27,197
for the appearance of stigmata
on people's palms,

381
00:32:27,239 --> 00:32:30,242
rather than the suggestion
from classic iconography,

382
00:32:30,284 --> 00:32:32,327
such as paintings and sculptures,
what have you?

383
00:32:33,954 --> 00:32:36,164
Because we know
at the time of Christ,

384
00:32:36,206 --> 00:32:39,626
Romans used to nail
people's wrists to the cross,

385
00:32:40,544 --> 00:32:42,129
and not their palms.

386
00:32:46,633 --> 00:32:47,676
Professor...

387
00:32:49,803 --> 00:32:52,306
I can only give you my testimony.

388
00:32:54,141 --> 00:32:56,185
I don't have answers for everything.

389
00:33:02,357 --> 00:33:05,360
[chattering, shouting]

390
00:33:10,365 --> 00:33:13,327
What did I tell you?
You can pick one.

391
00:33:17,623 --> 00:33:18,999
Would you like some bread?

392
00:33:19,708 --> 00:33:22,294
Did you hear about
the Virgin's appearance to Lucia?

393
00:33:25,589 --> 00:33:27,257
- [man] Mayor.
- [woman] Good morning, Mayor.

394
00:33:27,299 --> 00:33:28,967
[chattering continues]

395
00:33:30,677 --> 00:33:31,845
Good morning.

396
00:33:32,888 --> 00:33:34,973
- Good morning, Maria.
- [Maria] Good morning, sir.

397
00:33:35,015 --> 00:33:36,808
- Children.
- [girl] Good morning.

398
00:33:36,850 --> 00:33:39,144
I see you've produced
quite a bit of wool this year.

399
00:33:39,186 --> 00:33:43,148
Yes. With the flock and the crops,
thank God we aren't lacking any food.

400
00:33:43,190 --> 00:33:45,984
Or you could say thanks to you
and your husband's hard work.

401
00:33:50,113 --> 00:33:54,660
You are one of the few
educated citizens in this village,

402
00:33:54,701 --> 00:33:59,414
and I know how well-respected you are
for your help with the poor and the sick.

403
00:33:59,456 --> 00:34:04,753
That's why the rumors I've heard
about your daughter's daydreams

404
00:34:04,795 --> 00:34:07,714
are, to say the least, odd.

405
00:34:10,884 --> 00:34:12,219
Go finish that
over there, please.

406
00:34:17,056 --> 00:34:20,853
They might as well be harmful
to the village and to your family.

407
00:34:22,437 --> 00:34:25,274
They're just children's games.
Nothing too important.

408
00:34:26,567 --> 00:34:28,193
I will be more careful
if needed.

409
00:34:30,027 --> 00:34:31,362
Mayor, you have my word.

410
00:34:32,114 --> 00:34:33,699
Please give your husband
my regards.

411
00:34:33,739 --> 00:34:34,908
I will.

412
00:34:39,913 --> 00:34:44,710
[Maria] So, if it wasn't you,
nor Francisco or Jacinta...

413
00:34:46,253 --> 00:34:47,545
who was it?

414
00:34:47,588 --> 00:34:48,672
[girl] Hello, Papa.

415
00:34:49,422 --> 00:34:50,716
Father Ferreira, perhaps?

416
00:34:50,757 --> 00:34:51,800
I don't know.

417
00:34:51,842 --> 00:34:53,677
What's going on?

418
00:34:53,719 --> 00:34:54,719
Ask your daughter.

419
00:34:56,638 --> 00:34:57,931
Tell me what happened.

420
00:34:58,765 --> 00:35:01,310
At the market,
the mayor said it would be wise

421
00:35:01,351 --> 00:35:04,855
to keep an eye on our daughter
and all of this rambling nonsense,

422
00:35:04,897 --> 00:35:06,899
or else we'll be in trouble.

423
00:35:11,111 --> 00:35:12,487
We've done no wrong.

424
00:35:16,116 --> 00:35:17,618
You really shouldn't
worry so much.

425
00:35:19,620 --> 00:35:21,788
If you want, I can go
and have a talk with him.

426
00:35:22,623 --> 00:35:23,916
I already have.

427
00:35:24,374 --> 00:35:26,627
I told him
it was a children's game.

428
00:35:27,211 --> 00:35:28,462
[knocking]

429
00:35:40,516 --> 00:35:41,975
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

430
00:35:42,017 --> 00:35:44,019
- Maria.
- Just a minute.

431
00:35:50,442 --> 00:35:51,693
Here.

432
00:35:52,945 --> 00:35:54,029
Take this.

433
00:35:54,071 --> 00:35:57,533
- May God bless you.
- Oh, no, no. Thank you, madam.

434
00:35:59,701 --> 00:36:01,161
Is this the Santos home?

435
00:36:02,246 --> 00:36:03,288
Yes.

436
00:36:04,831 --> 00:36:06,375
I've come for the seers.

437
00:36:08,836 --> 00:36:10,879
No, we don't have
any seers here.

438
00:36:16,301 --> 00:36:19,346
Sorry. We were told
she lives here.

439
00:36:20,639 --> 00:36:21,849
Well, they've told you a lie.

440
00:36:21,890 --> 00:36:25,018
If you like, I can give you a cup of broth
and a place to stay.

441
00:36:25,060 --> 00:36:26,228
But I'm sorry to tell you

442
00:36:27,062 --> 00:36:28,480
there are no seers here.

443
00:36:31,149 --> 00:36:32,860
[woman] Thank you. Good night.

444
00:36:32,901 --> 00:36:34,403
- [António] Good night.
- [Maria] Good night.

445
00:36:38,699 --> 00:36:40,450
Go to your room.

446
00:36:52,546 --> 00:36:55,215
So, do you still think
there's nothing to worry about?

447
00:37:14,651 --> 00:37:17,029
[chattering]

448
00:37:17,070 --> 00:37:18,488
[Maria] Lucia, we have to go.

449
00:37:21,033 --> 00:37:23,911
See what you've done?
You deceived everyone.

450
00:37:25,037 --> 00:37:27,039
May God forgive us.
Let's use the back door.

451
00:37:28,624 --> 00:37:31,627
[chattering continues]

452
00:37:33,629 --> 00:37:35,631
[drum beating]

453
00:37:56,068 --> 00:37:59,446
[mayor] Marques, Alberto.
7th Battalion.

454
00:38:00,447 --> 00:38:01,448
Deceased.

455
00:38:02,783 --> 00:38:04,326
Martin...

456
00:38:05,369 --> 00:38:07,496
Well, I was told
she lives here.

457
00:38:07,538 --> 00:38:09,581
[woman] Ah, there they are.

458
00:38:13,210 --> 00:38:16,964
- Lucia! Lucia! It's time!
- It's time!

459
00:38:17,631 --> 00:38:18,632
What was she like?

460
00:38:19,299 --> 00:38:20,759
Did she speak to you?

461
00:38:20,801 --> 00:38:24,179
- [chattering]
- Please pray for us. Please. Please.

462
00:38:24,555 --> 00:38:27,599
- Ask her to forgive my son.
- I'll ask her.

463
00:38:27,641 --> 00:38:29,852
[woman] Please pray for us.
Please pray for us.

464
00:38:29,893 --> 00:38:32,896
Will you stop? They are only kids!

465
00:38:33,730 --> 00:38:35,858
[woman] Please wait! I beg you!

466
00:38:35,899 --> 00:38:37,776
Let's take the way
through the woods.

467
00:38:38,902 --> 00:38:40,445
- [bell tolling]
- ...Serafin.

468
00:38:40,487 --> 00:38:41,697
Come.

469
00:38:41,738 --> 00:38:44,449
[mayor]
2nd Battalion. Missing.

470
00:38:44,491 --> 00:38:48,328
We must go to church
to thank the Blessed Virgin

471
00:38:48,370 --> 00:38:51,206
for having protected your brother
once again.

472
00:38:51,248 --> 00:38:54,626
I can't come to church.
I promised the lady I would go back.

473
00:38:54,668 --> 00:38:56,962
Will you stop
disrespecting your mother?

474
00:38:57,379 --> 00:38:58,881
And the Holy Mother?

475
00:38:58,922 --> 00:39:00,382
- Let's go.
- I have to go.

476
00:39:14,188 --> 00:39:15,647
What shall we do?

477
00:39:16,398 --> 00:39:17,691
They're all there.

478
00:39:29,912 --> 00:39:31,205
[man] There she is.

479
00:39:31,246 --> 00:39:33,207
- Look!
- Let's go!

480
00:39:34,750 --> 00:39:36,710
Here they are, the seers.

481
00:39:38,212 --> 00:39:40,631
[Jacinta] I was worried
you weren't going to come.

482
00:39:40,672 --> 00:39:43,300
Please. My son, Diogo.

483
00:39:43,342 --> 00:39:46,345
- Can you ask the Virgin Mary to heal him?
- Can you help my wife?

484
00:39:49,723 --> 00:39:51,767
- Can you ask her to heal him?
- [man] Please.

485
00:39:51,808 --> 00:39:55,020
- [woman] I can't see her.
- Diogo cannot walk. Please.

486
00:39:55,062 --> 00:39:57,147
- [woman] I can't see her.
- [man] Lift her.

487
00:39:58,398 --> 00:40:00,651
- [woman] There she is.
- [man] I can see her.

488
00:40:29,721 --> 00:40:31,139
[chuckles]

489
00:40:33,100 --> 00:40:35,894
That's good. Very good, girl.

490
00:40:41,733 --> 00:40:42,860
Papa?

491
00:40:44,862 --> 00:40:46,113
Pray for us.

492
00:40:48,740 --> 00:40:50,158
Father Ferreira was right.

493
00:40:50,701 --> 00:40:53,912
I just saw the devil.
He hides among the good.

494
00:40:54,830 --> 00:40:55,831
Lucia.

495
00:40:59,251 --> 00:41:00,502
We have to pray.

496
00:41:50,010 --> 00:41:53,680
It pleases me
that you have been praying for me.

497
00:41:55,682 --> 00:41:58,185
You must keep on
praying the rosary.

498
00:41:59,978 --> 00:42:01,813
You should also learn to read.

499
00:42:03,065 --> 00:42:04,816
It is very important.

500
00:42:05,567 --> 00:42:06,777
We will.

501
00:42:06,818 --> 00:42:08,362
[whispers]
We should learn to read.

502
00:42:12,366 --> 00:42:14,159
Diogo is here
with his mother.

503
00:42:14,743 --> 00:42:16,203
He can't walk.

504
00:42:23,043 --> 00:42:25,629
He will heal if he starts believing.

505
00:42:27,256 --> 00:42:28,715
Mother, thank you.

506
00:42:29,299 --> 00:42:31,593
She says God will heal Diogo.

507
00:42:32,636 --> 00:42:35,556
He will heal
if he starts believing.

508
00:42:37,099 --> 00:42:38,433
[woman] What does that mean?

509
00:42:38,475 --> 00:42:40,894
My son is already a believer.

510
00:42:40,936 --> 00:42:42,855
He will be healed, but when?

511
00:42:42,896 --> 00:42:44,231
[man] Wait, Benedetta.

512
00:43:12,926 --> 00:43:13,927
I'm sorry, Mother.

513
00:43:19,474 --> 00:43:21,435
We want to go
to heaven with you.

514
00:43:23,645 --> 00:43:27,316
Francisco and Jacinta
will join me soon.

515
00:43:29,109 --> 00:43:30,152
But...

516
00:43:30,194 --> 00:43:32,029
[whispering]
She said we're going to heaven soon.

517
00:43:32,070 --> 00:43:33,572
But you have to stay.

518
00:43:34,907 --> 00:43:36,992
Jesus has chosen you.

519
00:43:38,911 --> 00:43:43,916
You are going to be the messenger of faith
in Mary's Immaculate Heart.

520
00:43:43,957 --> 00:43:46,668
Why does it have to be them
and not me?

521
00:43:51,507 --> 00:43:52,674
One day...

522
00:43:54,510 --> 00:43:56,970
a long time from now...

523
00:43:58,889 --> 00:44:00,807
I will come for you.

524
00:44:03,143 --> 00:44:05,479
I will never leave you alone.

525
00:44:26,416 --> 00:44:27,709
She is gone.

526
00:44:31,880 --> 00:44:33,882
[people murmuring]

527
00:44:44,810 --> 00:44:46,353
Lucia. Lucia!

528
00:44:50,649 --> 00:44:51,733
Jacinta!

529
00:44:53,277 --> 00:44:55,195
[Diogo] Wait, Papa.
Put me down.

530
00:44:56,154 --> 00:44:57,322
Put me down.

531
00:45:00,951 --> 00:45:02,202
Diogo.

532
00:45:03,871 --> 00:45:05,747
[sobbing] Diogo.

533
00:45:07,499 --> 00:45:09,042
You are walking.

534
00:45:10,335 --> 00:45:12,254
[parents gasping]

535
00:45:55,339 --> 00:45:57,966
[women sobbing]

536
00:46:08,018 --> 00:46:10,562
[heavy breathing]

537
00:46:17,903 --> 00:46:19,404
[man] There is one other thing.

538
00:46:20,948 --> 00:46:22,616
There was also a healing.

539
00:46:23,242 --> 00:46:24,618
Who was it?
Did you question them?

540
00:46:24,660 --> 00:46:27,120
No. He's just a boy.

541
00:46:27,162 --> 00:46:28,914
Diogo Lima.

542
00:46:28,956 --> 00:46:30,916
I know him.
When I was a child,

543
00:46:30,958 --> 00:46:32,793
his father and I
were good friends.

544
00:46:32,835 --> 00:46:35,254
He was paralyzed. Then, suddenly,

545
00:46:35,295 --> 00:46:38,423
for no reason,
he's able to move slightly.

546
00:46:39,091 --> 00:46:40,676
Some are calling it a miracle.

547
00:46:40,717 --> 00:46:44,263
A miracle? When Diogo Lima fell
from the barn's roof,

548
00:46:44,304 --> 00:46:47,015
I was the one who took him
to the hospital in Leiria.

549
00:46:47,057 --> 00:46:49,351
The doctors told me
he'd start to walk again

550
00:46:49,393 --> 00:46:53,438
if he really committed to it
and made a great effort in doing so.

551
00:46:53,480 --> 00:46:56,733
So, the appearances,
the miracle, the seers...

552
00:46:56,775 --> 00:46:58,443
it's all rubbish.

553
00:46:58,819 --> 00:47:00,988
But I believe
that's what people want,

554
00:47:01,029 --> 00:47:04,241
nothing else than tales
and a divine providence.

555
00:47:04,283 --> 00:47:05,325
[sighs]

556
00:47:06,076 --> 00:47:07,953
We need to stop
the word from spreading.

557
00:47:07,995 --> 00:47:09,288
Absolutely, sir.

558
00:47:10,122 --> 00:47:11,206
But it won't be easy.

559
00:47:12,374 --> 00:47:13,709
Thank you, Captain.

560
00:47:15,002 --> 00:47:16,211
Good evening, <i>Senhora</i> Adelina.

561
00:47:17,087 --> 00:47:18,172
Mayor.

562
00:47:21,925 --> 00:47:22,968
[door opens]

563
00:47:23,010 --> 00:47:25,470
What harm can three little children
possibly do?

564
00:47:25,512 --> 00:47:26,555
[door closes]

565
00:47:26,597 --> 00:47:27,681
More than you think.

566
00:47:29,808 --> 00:47:32,686
They are roughly the same age
as Victor and Republica.

567
00:47:33,687 --> 00:47:35,564
Can you see our children
heading up an insurrection?

568
00:47:35,606 --> 00:47:38,442
Adelina, what is dangerous
is what they represent.

569
00:47:38,483 --> 00:47:39,693
More dangerous than weapons.

570
00:47:40,861 --> 00:47:43,822
What could be dangerous
about meeting the Holy Virgin?

571
00:47:43,864 --> 00:47:45,407
It is a beautiful thing.

572
00:47:46,366 --> 00:47:48,869
And it's wonderful
that it happened right here.

573
00:47:50,871 --> 00:47:54,499
You and I, we're so different.

574
00:47:55,292 --> 00:47:58,212
Yet we're good together. Right?

575
00:47:58,879 --> 00:48:00,380
Yes, of course, but...

576
00:48:01,381 --> 00:48:03,592
this has nothing to do with us.

577
00:48:03,634 --> 00:48:07,095
My rivals will use this tale
to attack me.

578
00:48:07,137 --> 00:48:12,184
I won't risk my position, my ideas,
everything I've built from scratch,

579
00:48:12,226 --> 00:48:13,852
for the imaginings
of three little children

580
00:48:13,894 --> 00:48:15,521
and some stupid superstition.

581
00:48:15,562 --> 00:48:17,397
Some stupid superstitions?

582
00:48:19,024 --> 00:48:21,360
So you've married
a stupid, superstitious woman.

583
00:48:21,401 --> 00:48:22,444
I didn't say that.

584
00:48:22,486 --> 00:48:25,614
All I'm saying is that there was
no miracle or appearance today.

585
00:48:27,574 --> 00:48:29,034
Let's just say that...

586
00:48:30,410 --> 00:48:32,913
it wasn't the Virgin Mary
who healed Diogo.

587
00:48:34,581 --> 00:48:38,001
But if he found the strength
to walk today, of all days,

588
00:48:38,043 --> 00:48:40,212
and in this specific place,

589
00:48:40,254 --> 00:48:42,256
then it's all down to his faith.

590
00:48:47,761 --> 00:48:49,304
[squawking]

591
00:48:58,438 --> 00:49:00,357
- [bleating]
- [bells clanking]

592
00:49:07,614 --> 00:49:09,199
- Mom?
- Yes?

593
00:49:09,241 --> 00:49:11,577
I want to learn
how to read and write.

594
00:49:11,618 --> 00:49:13,287
Oh, finally.

595
00:49:13,328 --> 00:49:16,415
I've told you so many times
how important it is.

596
00:49:16,456 --> 00:49:18,709
Because the lady says so.

597
00:49:18,750 --> 00:49:19,835
Of course.

598
00:49:20,377 --> 00:49:22,296
Now that the lady says so.

599
00:49:44,610 --> 00:49:45,611
Let's go.

600
00:50:01,960 --> 00:50:03,629
[chattering]

601
00:50:06,048 --> 00:50:08,842
I lost my son,
and the Holy Mother did nothing.

602
00:50:12,179 --> 00:50:14,890
She let him die, like a dog,

603
00:50:15,599 --> 00:50:17,017
far from home.

604
00:50:18,352 --> 00:50:21,063
Although I prayed
day and night!

605
00:50:21,104 --> 00:50:22,940
I don't believe you anymore!

606
00:50:22,981 --> 00:50:24,525
I don't believe anything!

607
00:50:25,526 --> 00:50:26,693
Just go away!

608
00:50:27,611 --> 00:50:29,321
[man] Come with me.
Come on.

609
00:50:29,363 --> 00:50:30,614
[sobbing]

610
00:50:31,698 --> 00:50:34,535
It's best you go home
and stop spreading lies.

611
00:50:35,202 --> 00:50:38,205
You should be ashamed
of having a daughter like her.

612
00:50:39,039 --> 00:50:42,167
You of all people,
who preaches faith and devotion.

613
00:50:42,209 --> 00:50:45,087
If she's crazy,
she should be shut away in a convent.

614
00:50:46,213 --> 00:50:48,882
Do you see what happens
when you make things up?

615
00:50:50,217 --> 00:50:52,219
Confess now, before everyone.

616
00:50:54,179 --> 00:50:56,390
And let us get all done with this.

617
00:51:03,730 --> 00:51:06,817
It's true, Mama. I saw the lady.

618
00:51:07,734 --> 00:51:09,194
And I'm not crazy.

619
00:51:22,416 --> 00:51:25,127
It takes courage
to vent your anger on a child.

620
00:51:27,004 --> 00:51:29,423
You have no children.

621
00:51:30,465 --> 00:51:34,553
And yours are but babies
who live in the warmth of your sound roof.

622
00:51:35,846 --> 00:51:38,765
I cannot hate you,
because that would be a sin.

623
00:51:46,481 --> 00:51:48,984
[door opens, closes]

624
00:51:52,321 --> 00:51:53,363
Ah!

625
00:51:57,284 --> 00:51:58,785
[clattering]

626
00:52:06,168 --> 00:52:07,211

627
00:52:10,214 --> 00:52:11,465
[grunts]

628
00:52:12,132 --> 00:52:14,134
[sobbing]

629
00:52:52,631 --> 00:52:54,299
[dog barking]

630
00:52:54,341 --> 00:52:55,843
[Maria] "As the Father has loved me,

631
00:52:56,677 --> 00:52:58,053
so have I loved you.

632
00:52:59,555 --> 00:53:01,348
Now remain in my love.

633
00:53:01,390 --> 00:53:02,474
[silverware clatters]

634
00:53:02,516 --> 00:53:04,685
If you keep my commands,

635
00:53:04,726 --> 00:53:06,353
you will remain in my love,

636
00:53:07,020 --> 00:53:09,731
just as I have kept
my Father's commands,

637
00:53:09,773 --> 00:53:11,859
and remain in His love."

638
00:53:11,900 --> 00:53:16,154
So Jesus said, "In truth I tell you,

639
00:53:16,196 --> 00:53:20,534
may my joy dwell in you,
and may your joy be full.

640
00:53:21,326 --> 00:53:26,832
My command is this:
love each other as I have loved you.

641
00:53:26,874 --> 00:53:27,958
Greater love..."

642
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:29,209
What are you waiting for?

643
00:53:29,251 --> 00:53:30,669
- Manuel!
- Come here.

644
00:53:30,711 --> 00:53:34,256
"...to lay down one's life
for one's friends."

645
00:53:34,965 --> 00:53:36,717

[accordion playing melody]

648
00:53:58,530 --> 00:54:00,407
I don't want to go back
to the front.

649
00:54:02,910 --> 00:54:03,952
Let me stay.

650
00:54:05,996 --> 00:54:07,706
Forget her, I beg you.

651
00:54:08,916 --> 00:54:11,335
Don't go there ever again.

652
00:54:11,376 --> 00:54:12,628
I can't just...

653
00:54:12,669 --> 00:54:14,046
Father Ferreira is right.

654
00:54:15,464 --> 00:54:17,633
- The lady is the devil's daughter.
- That is not true!

655
00:54:24,056 --> 00:54:25,307
I don't want to die.

656
00:54:27,226 --> 00:54:29,102
I beg you, don't go back to her.

657
00:54:30,604 --> 00:54:32,940
Then everything will be
as it used to.

658
00:54:37,236 --> 00:54:39,655
Manuel, come.

659
00:54:56,338 --> 00:54:58,799
[airplanes flying overhead]

Shh, shh, shh.

00:55:10,602 --> 00:55:11,812
You can't sleep?

662
00:55:12,312 --> 00:55:13,313
No.

663
00:55:13,355 --> 00:55:14,940
Neither can I.

664
00:55:17,359 --> 00:55:18,777
- Papa.
- Mmm?

665
00:55:20,654 --> 00:55:21,905
Do you believe me?

666
00:55:24,825 --> 00:55:25,993
I don't know.

667
00:55:30,789 --> 00:55:32,499
I know I'll never leave you.

668
00:55:36,211 --> 00:55:39,047
But I thought
it was such a beautiful thing.

669
00:55:39,089 --> 00:55:40,883
Yes, it is beautiful.

670
00:55:42,384 --> 00:55:45,345
Then why does it seem
like I'm hurting everyone?

671
00:55:48,557 --> 00:55:53,854
At times, our special gifts
can lead to trouble.

672
00:55:55,689 --> 00:55:57,232
People can get jealous.

673
00:55:58,817 --> 00:56:00,485
Others might not understand.

00:56:23,884 --> 00:56:25,886
Come on.

676
00:56:46,114 --> 00:56:47,491
Whenever.

677
00:56:47,533 --> 00:56:49,576

Please, Father.

[mutters, faint]

679
00:57:28,699 --> 00:57:29,825
Get out.

00:57:31,785 --> 00:57:34,413
Get out! This is my field!

[chattering]

682
00:58:02,191 --> 00:58:04,109
[woman] We didn't know
where to settle down.

683
00:58:04,818 --> 00:58:06,486
We're here for the Virgin.

684
00:58:07,237 --> 00:58:09,239
We've all come
from far away.

685
00:58:09,281 --> 00:58:10,449
You've...

00:58:11,241 --> 00:58:12,242
[sighs]

687
00:58:13,285 --> 00:58:16,622
You've destroyed...
This is our crop.

688

This is...

689
00:58:21,043 --> 00:58:22,377
[woman] I'm sorry.

690
00:58:23,128 --> 00:58:25,339
We are going to leave
after the appearance.

691
00:58:35,015 --> 00:58:36,433
Bless us, O Lord, and these gifts...

692
00:58:36,475 --> 00:58:38,810
[all] Bless us, O Lord, and these gifts...

693
00:58:38,852 --> 00:58:41,647
...which we're about to receive
from Thy bounty...

694
00:58:41,688 --> 00:58:43,941
...which we're about to receive
from Thy bounty...

695
00:58:43,982 --> 00:58:46,777
- ...through Christ our Lord.
- ...through Christ our Lord.

696
00:58:47,444 --> 00:58:51,114
- Thanks be to God. Amen.
- Thanks be to God. Amen.

697
00:58:53,200 --> 00:58:54,284
Amen.

698
00:58:56,370 --> 00:58:57,579
Give me the wine.

699
00:59:02,543 --> 00:59:04,878
Papa is worried,
and it's all your fault.

700
00:59:04,920 --> 00:59:06,505
This coming winter,
we won't have anything to eat...

701
00:59:06,547 --> 00:59:09,049
Stop it. Don't insist.

702
00:59:14,680 --> 00:59:15,764
[António] Serve yourself.

703
00:59:26,900 --> 00:59:29,027
At the market the other day,

704
00:59:29,903 --> 00:59:31,196
I saw Dona Clara.

705
00:59:33,699 --> 00:59:35,075
Are you listening, António?

706
00:59:35,701 --> 00:59:36,785
Yes.

707
00:59:37,452 --> 00:59:38,954
Can you help me here,
please?

708
00:59:41,248 --> 00:59:44,585
She said she was looking for someone
to help her around the house.

709
00:59:45,544 --> 00:59:48,213
- And she asked about Carolina.
- No.

710
00:59:48,255 --> 00:59:49,631
But the Gomezes
are good people.

711
00:59:54,595 --> 00:59:58,098
Do you think I like the idea
of sending our daughter off to work?

712
01:00:19,536 --> 01:00:20,746
I didn't mean to.

713
01:00:28,003 --> 01:00:30,797
I have the feeling
we are losing everything we love...

714
01:00:33,133 --> 01:00:34,927
and have built so far.

715
01:00:39,056 --> 01:00:40,557
I feel useless.

716
01:01:00,911 --> 01:01:02,663
I don't want you to go.

717
01:01:04,122 --> 01:01:05,332
I won't.

718
01:01:08,293 --> 01:01:10,295
[bleating]

719
01:01:44,872 --> 01:01:46,248
I beg you!

720
01:01:51,920 --> 01:01:54,131
I don't want other people suffering!

721
01:02:05,893 --> 01:02:08,395
I do this for the sinners!

722
01:02:08,437 --> 01:02:09,771
As you asked!

723
01:02:13,525 --> 01:02:15,027
Where are you?

724
01:02:17,321 --> 01:02:18,363
Where are you?

725
01:02:22,409 --> 01:02:23,911
Where are you?

726
01:02:35,839 --> 01:02:39,968
[Nichols] But how did you,
Francisco and Jacinta endure it all?

727
01:02:40,010 --> 01:02:41,803
You were only ten years old.

728
01:02:41,845 --> 01:02:43,472
But what strikes me even more

729
01:02:43,514 --> 01:02:46,975
is the message you claim
the Virgin charged you with,

730
01:02:47,017 --> 01:02:49,895
a message of suffering
and atonement.

731
01:02:49,937 --> 01:02:52,397
Why would she choose you,
a child, of all people?

732
01:02:53,732 --> 01:02:55,859
There was just one moment

733
01:02:56,568 --> 01:02:58,612
when I couldn't understand.

734
01:02:59,947 --> 01:03:03,242
But we were willing
to put up with it all.

735
01:03:05,244 --> 01:03:09,373
I know. It's hard to understand
for someone who's not a believer.

736
01:03:09,414 --> 01:03:10,457
I understand.

737
01:03:11,291 --> 01:03:16,088
Innocent messengers make the message
all the more sacred and unassailable.

738
01:03:16,129 --> 01:03:17,464
But at what cost?

739
01:03:18,048 --> 01:03:19,883
Do you really think
that's what your God wants?

740
01:03:19,925 --> 01:03:22,928
It seems contrary
to all logic to me

741
01:03:22,970 --> 01:03:26,265
to ask little children...
seven, eight, ten-year-olds...

742
01:03:26,306 --> 01:03:30,269
to suffer and make sacrifices
the way you three did.

743
01:03:31,311 --> 01:03:33,981
Sure, you could tell me
that Christ sacrificed himself.

744
01:03:34,022 --> 01:03:37,025
But he did it for his beliefs,
his ideas.

745
01:03:38,485 --> 01:03:39,778
But he was a grown man.

746
01:03:43,073 --> 01:03:46,577
Faith begins
at the edges of understanding.

747
01:03:46,618 --> 01:03:50,455
But it's there where scientific research
for the truth should begin.

748
01:03:50,497 --> 01:03:55,961
But then what is faith
if not the search for truth?

749
01:03:56,003 --> 01:03:58,463
An inexplicable truth

750
01:03:58,505 --> 01:04:00,674
which breeds irrational hope.

751
01:04:10,100 --> 01:04:13,187
[chattering]

752
01:04:26,283 --> 01:04:28,493
[woman] Mama,
it is far too hot for you here.

753
01:04:28,535 --> 01:04:29,995
No, I'm fine.

754
01:04:33,123 --> 01:04:34,750
Greetings, Mayor.

755
01:04:35,709 --> 01:04:36,710
The men are ready.

756
01:04:37,336 --> 01:04:39,046
I can give them the order
to have it cleared.

757
01:04:42,382 --> 01:04:45,010
No, there is no point.
There are too many people.

758
01:05:03,195 --> 01:05:06,281
[no audible dialogue]

759
01:05:06,573 --> 01:05:09,284
They're not talking to anyone.

760
01:05:09,785 --> 01:05:11,870
[Lucia] And nobody believes me.

761
01:05:13,914 --> 01:05:15,249
Can I ask you for a miracle

762
01:05:15,290 --> 01:05:17,918
so that everyone will know
you appeared to us?

763
01:05:21,088 --> 01:05:25,175
Soon she will perform a miracle
for everyone to see,

764
01:05:25,217 --> 01:05:27,928
so you can believe it is true.

765
01:05:27,970 --> 01:05:30,097
So, why doesn't she
do it now then?

766
01:05:30,138 --> 01:05:31,723
- He's right.
- [crowd chattering, murmuring]

767
01:05:31,765 --> 01:05:33,559
[woman] Because it is all a lie.

768
01:05:33,600 --> 01:05:35,269
- There is no appearance happening.
- [António] Shh.

769
01:05:37,521 --> 01:05:39,773
You must pray often...

770
01:05:41,441 --> 01:05:43,277
and suffer greatly.

771
01:05:44,611 --> 01:05:47,030
Sacrifice yourself for sinners.

772
01:05:48,115 --> 01:05:51,118
Do not hurt yourselves
with ropes.

773
01:05:54,830 --> 01:05:56,790
And repeat this prayer.

774
01:06:01,670 --> 01:06:02,921
O Jesus.

775
01:06:03,922 --> 01:06:05,757
[children] O Jesus.

776
01:06:05,799 --> 01:06:07,968
[all] O Jesus.

777
01:06:10,470 --> 01:06:12,890
[Virgin Mary] I'm offering you this...

778
01:06:12,931 --> 01:06:14,808
[children] I'm offering you this...

779
01:06:15,475 --> 01:06:17,895
[all] I'm offering you this...

780
01:06:17,936 --> 01:06:20,272
...in exchange for your love.

781
01:06:20,314 --> 01:06:22,149
[children]
...in exchange for your love.

782
01:06:23,400 --> 01:06:25,652
[all] ...in exchange for your love.

783
01:06:26,236 --> 01:06:28,447
[children]
For the conversion of sinners...

784
01:06:28,488 --> 01:06:32,075
[all] For the conversion of sinners...

785
01:06:32,117 --> 01:06:35,120
[children]
...and to amend sins committed against

786
01:06:35,162 --> 01:06:37,664
the Immaculate Heart of Mary.

787
01:06:37,706 --> 01:06:43,670
[all] ...and to amend sins committed
against the Immaculate Heart of Mary.

788
01:07:01,897 --> 01:07:04,191
[people screaming]

789
01:07:04,233 --> 01:07:05,859
[crashing]

790
01:07:07,861 --> 01:07:09,696
[screaming continues]

791
01:07:12,574 --> 01:07:14,826
[people shrieking]

792
01:07:24,545 --> 01:07:26,505
What was that?

793
01:07:26,547 --> 01:07:28,131
[Virgin Mary] That was hell.

794
01:07:29,132 --> 01:07:31,885
Where the sinners' poor souls go.

795
01:07:35,305 --> 01:07:37,975
If we do not stop insulting God...

796
01:07:39,101 --> 01:07:42,604
there will be a war
worse than this one.

797
01:07:57,286 --> 01:07:59,413
[machine gun fire]

798
01:08:12,259 --> 01:08:14,303
[sirens wailing]

799
01:08:20,184 --> 01:08:22,810
[airplanes flying overhead]

800
01:08:40,370 --> 01:08:42,872
[bomb whistling]

801
01:08:44,166 --> 01:08:46,627
[airplane flying overhead]

802
01:08:52,090 --> 01:08:53,926
[groans]

803
01:08:53,966 --> 01:08:56,011
[men screaming]

804
01:09:01,517 --> 01:09:06,020
This is what will happen
if sinners do not convert.

805
01:09:09,942 --> 01:09:13,819
Do not tell anyone
what you have seen

806
01:09:13,862 --> 01:09:15,322
until I tell you to.

807
01:09:15,948 --> 01:09:17,616
[gasping]

808
01:09:26,082 --> 01:09:27,376
[woman] Why is she crying?

809
01:09:27,417 --> 01:09:29,502
[crowd murmuring]

810
01:09:34,049 --> 01:09:35,634
Tell Papa what happened.

811
01:09:36,510 --> 01:09:38,636
The lady told me
not to tell anyone.

812
01:09:40,596 --> 01:09:43,850
She said we had to pray
and repent for our sins.

813
01:09:44,852 --> 01:09:47,062
- We need to pray.
- She's right.

814
01:09:47,104 --> 01:09:50,064
[woman] The seer is saying we must ask
for forgiveness for our sins.

815
01:10:21,513 --> 01:10:23,307
As I told you before,

816
01:10:23,348 --> 01:10:26,560
you can't keep a secret
from a priest.

817
01:10:28,812 --> 01:10:32,399
Father Ferreira is right.
He's a man of God.

818
01:10:32,441 --> 01:10:34,693
Father, I told her,
but it's useless.

819
01:10:34,735 --> 01:10:37,279
[people shouting]

820
01:10:43,452 --> 01:10:44,912
Stay back! Stay back!

821
01:10:46,163 --> 01:10:48,665
This is a house of peace.
Please take your guards away.

822
01:10:48,707 --> 01:10:51,210
Rallies are illegal.
I did warn you.

823
01:10:52,336 --> 01:10:54,213
Remove all these people
from the church.

824
01:10:54,254 --> 01:10:57,466
They have to go back
to wherever they came from. Go.

825
01:10:57,508 --> 01:11:00,427
- [whimpering]
- Stop! Will you stop, please?

826
01:11:00,469 --> 01:11:03,972
There's no need for violence.
I will exit with all my faithful.

827
01:11:05,557 --> 01:11:07,559
Let the priest guide them out.

828
01:11:16,360 --> 01:11:19,738
Artur, stop.
How can you do this?

829
01:11:19,780 --> 01:11:20,822
This is absurd.

830
01:11:20,864 --> 01:11:22,241
I'm doing this for you.

831
01:11:22,574 --> 01:11:24,868
Would you like people to talk
about a priest in Fátima

832
01:11:24,910 --> 01:11:27,579
who's being fooled
by three lying children?

833
01:11:28,622 --> 01:11:31,750
This is not faith.
This is superstition, and we both know it.

834
01:11:31,792 --> 01:11:34,211
No. So your answer to this

835
01:11:34,253 --> 01:11:37,172
is pushing out all the faithful
who came here for confession

836
01:11:37,214 --> 01:11:38,799
and bolt the church?

837
01:11:38,841 --> 01:11:40,217
[hammering]

838
01:11:40,259 --> 01:11:43,554
Your mother used to come here often,
and she would bring you with her.

839
01:11:43,595 --> 01:11:46,932
My mother was illiterate.
Unfortunately for you, I'm not.

840
01:11:46,974 --> 01:11:49,434
- I'm different.
- Knowledge means tolerance.

841
01:11:51,061 --> 01:11:54,147
Until order is restored,
the church stays closed.

842
01:12:00,904 --> 01:12:03,198
He had them
shut down the church.

843
01:12:03,240 --> 01:12:04,950
- That's never happened here.
- Adelina, enough!

844
01:12:04,992 --> 01:12:06,618
These issues
do not concern you.

845
01:12:06,660 --> 01:12:08,161
Yes, they do.

846
01:12:12,332 --> 01:12:13,375
Read this.

847
01:12:14,334 --> 01:12:15,794
It's from Lisbon,

848
01:12:15,836 --> 01:12:18,797
requesting an explanation
and instructing me to restore order.

849
01:12:20,424 --> 01:12:24,178
This is not an easy time for me, Adelina.
Please try to understand that.

850
01:12:24,720 --> 01:12:26,680
And don't make things
even more difficult for me

851
01:12:26,722 --> 01:12:28,223
like you did today.

852
01:12:50,370 --> 01:12:54,082
So, the Virgin
has revealed some secrets to you.

853
01:12:56,084 --> 01:12:58,712
[coughing]

854
01:13:01,632 --> 01:13:05,469
Apparently, she told you
not to say anything

855
01:13:05,511 --> 01:13:09,014
about these secrets,
not even to your bishop.

856
01:13:09,723 --> 01:13:10,891
Yes, Excellency.

857
01:13:12,559 --> 01:13:15,729
But I thought you said
you could not hear her.

858
01:13:16,146 --> 01:13:17,272
Is that right?

859
01:13:18,607 --> 01:13:19,858
[Lucia] We told him.

860
01:13:19,900 --> 01:13:22,819
We tell him
everything the Virgin says.

861
01:13:22,861 --> 01:13:24,863
I am not talking to you now.

862
01:13:27,574 --> 01:13:30,702
So, you said
you cannot hear her

863
01:13:30,744 --> 01:13:33,747
because you haven't prayed
the rosary enough.

864
01:13:34,790 --> 01:13:37,876
I... I don't know.

865
01:13:37,918 --> 01:13:41,088
But the Virgin
did not explain why,

866
01:13:41,129 --> 01:13:43,882
of all people
she might have appeared to,

867
01:13:43,924 --> 01:13:46,385
she chose a boy
who doesn't pray enough.

868
01:13:47,845 --> 01:13:49,847
How long is this torture
going to last?

869
01:13:50,764 --> 01:13:54,518
Father, he's been asking the same question
for the last two hours.

870
01:13:54,560 --> 01:13:57,938
As long as the monsignor
deems necessary.

871
01:14:00,190 --> 01:14:01,441
Jacinta.

872
01:14:02,693 --> 01:14:03,944
Tell me the truth.

873
01:14:07,447 --> 01:14:09,825
[monsignor]
Whatever the truth may be,

874
01:14:09,867 --> 01:14:12,828
it won't only be
the parish who will pay,

875
01:14:12,870 --> 01:14:15,581
but all the Church of Portugal.

876
01:14:30,804 --> 01:14:33,974
[bystanders chattering]

877
01:14:34,975 --> 01:14:36,643
I'm going to see Tio Anastacio.

878
01:14:37,853 --> 01:14:40,647
[chattering continues]

879
01:14:50,490 --> 01:14:53,410
Can you please go?
That's enough.

880
01:14:53,827 --> 01:14:56,496
- Can you go back? Just go back.
- Please. Please.

881
01:14:56,872 --> 01:14:58,665
Freire, Eduardo.

882
01:14:59,166 --> 01:15:02,002
19th Battalion. Deceased.

883
01:15:03,337 --> 01:15:07,716
Filipe, Paulo. 19th Battalion.

884
01:15:08,342 --> 01:15:10,302
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

885
01:15:10,344 --> 01:15:12,179
[Artur continues reading]

886
01:15:12,221 --> 01:15:16,725
The last time I heard from my eldest son
was two months ago.

887
01:15:18,227 --> 01:15:19,937
[Artur] Gavinho, Eduardo.

888
01:15:19,978 --> 01:15:23,607
- 19th Battalion. Deceased.
- [sobbing]

889
01:15:25,484 --> 01:15:27,778
- [Artur continues reading]
- [sobbing continues]

890
01:15:27,819 --> 01:15:29,196
[coughing]

891
01:15:29,238 --> 01:15:31,782
Mama, are you all right?

892
01:15:31,823 --> 01:15:32,866
Yes.

893
01:15:33,534 --> 01:15:36,245
Sales, Francisco.

894
01:15:36,286 --> 01:15:39,373
11th Battalion. Deceased.

895
01:15:42,918 --> 01:15:45,087
Santos, Manuel.

896
01:15:46,547 --> 01:15:49,341
[church bell tolls]

897
01:15:49,383 --> 01:15:50,717
4th Battalion.

898
01:15:51,969 --> 01:15:53,428
Missing in battle.

899
01:15:57,057 --> 01:15:58,350
[Artur] That's it.

900
01:16:00,978 --> 01:16:04,565
Every time I read the name
of one of our boys who lost his life

901
01:16:04,606 --> 01:16:06,942
- defending the ideals of our republic...
- Mama.

902
01:16:06,984 --> 01:16:09,027
- ...I have great admiration for them.
- Mama.

903
01:16:09,570 --> 01:16:12,573
But also immense pain.

904
01:16:12,614 --> 01:16:13,615
Mama.

905
01:16:14,908 --> 01:16:18,036
- Please.
- [Artur] But today I ask you...

906
01:16:19,037 --> 01:16:20,205
Mama.

907
01:16:20,956 --> 01:16:23,959
[Artur] ...if the Virgin has appeared
for real in Fátima,

908
01:16:24,001 --> 01:16:28,755
then why on earth didn't she protect
these poor young men

909
01:16:28,797 --> 01:16:31,300
and spare their families this awful pain?

910
01:16:59,161 --> 01:17:00,787
[sobbing]

911
01:17:14,968 --> 01:17:18,555
The mayor said he's lost,
not dead.

912
01:17:19,348 --> 01:17:21,016
- The lady will help us.
- Oh!

913
01:17:21,433 --> 01:17:23,602
You mustn't say her name
in my presence!

914
01:17:23,644 --> 01:17:24,686
But it is true, Mama.

915
01:17:24,728 --> 01:17:25,729
[gasps]

916
01:17:29,608 --> 01:17:32,819
- For the sinners...
- Oh, stop making fun of me!

917
01:17:33,779 --> 01:17:36,782
Do you hear me?
Don't make fun of me!

918
01:17:36,823 --> 01:17:40,994
If Manuel doesn't come back,
it's all your fault.

919
01:18:17,114 --> 01:18:20,117
[sobbing]

920
01:19:06,622 --> 01:19:09,166
- [dogs barking]
- [sheep bleating]

921
01:19:09,208 --> 01:19:10,417
Papa.

922
01:19:23,430 --> 01:19:24,806
I'm going to sell the herd.

923
01:19:27,100 --> 01:19:29,770
There's no need for you
to go to Cova da Iria anymore.

924
01:19:57,256 --> 01:20:01,260
[monsignor] I understand you are no longer
so sure of what you have said.

925
01:20:02,803 --> 01:20:05,180
- [Francisco] Yes, she is.
- Tell him.

926
01:20:05,222 --> 01:20:07,641
- Let her speak.
- Jacinta. Shh.

927
01:20:08,392 --> 01:20:12,145
[monsignor] You heard your mother.
Say what you must.

928
01:21:00,444 --> 01:21:03,697
You caused the church
to be shut down.

929
01:21:04,531 --> 01:21:07,743
Do you understand
how serious that is?

930
01:21:11,038 --> 01:21:15,042
All you need to say now is,
"I made everything up."

931
01:21:15,083 --> 01:21:17,419
And everything will be solved.

932
01:21:25,719 --> 01:21:26,929
[whispers] Thank you.

933
01:21:36,855 --> 01:21:40,108
I don't know anymore. Please.

934
01:21:42,319 --> 01:21:43,403
So?

935
01:21:44,905 --> 01:21:50,244
Lucia, you don't have to worry anymore
about what you told me yesterday.

936
01:21:51,036 --> 01:21:52,621
Sometimes we lose ourselves.

937
01:21:53,914 --> 01:21:55,165
What I need to hear...

938
01:21:56,416 --> 01:21:59,878
is what you are feeling
deep down. Hmm?

939
01:22:03,298 --> 01:22:04,424
[chuckles softly]

940
01:22:07,970 --> 01:22:10,097
I will speak to the Curia.

941
01:22:10,931 --> 01:22:13,433
Your behavior is ridiculous.

942
01:22:14,101 --> 01:22:17,104
- [woman 1] Excellency. Excellency.
- [woman 2] Please pray for me.

943
01:22:17,604 --> 01:22:19,815
- [man] Please pray for me.
- [woman 3] Please bless us.

944
01:22:20,983 --> 01:22:22,776
[coughing]

945
01:22:26,238 --> 01:22:27,739
Can we pray with you?

946
01:22:47,134 --> 01:22:51,471
[all] Hail Mary, full of grace,
the Lord is with thee.

947
01:22:51,513 --> 01:22:52,890
Blessed art thou among women,

948
01:22:52,931 --> 01:22:55,767
and blessed is the fruit
of thy womb, Jesus.

949
01:22:56,768 --> 01:23:00,772
Holy Mary, Mother of God,
pray for us sinners,

950
01:23:00,814 --> 01:23:03,025
now and at the hour of our death.

951
01:23:20,959 --> 01:23:23,670
[Nichols] <i>Did you ever have doubts
about what you'd seen?</i>

952
01:23:24,671 --> 01:23:28,467
Did you never once thought,
not even later on,

953
01:23:28,509 --> 01:23:31,553
that your imagination
might have been sparked by...

954
01:23:31,595 --> 01:23:34,306
influenced by circumstances?

955
01:23:34,348 --> 01:23:36,350
War, hunger, solitude.

956
01:23:38,852 --> 01:23:40,062
A lack of affection.

957
01:23:41,021 --> 01:23:42,022
Why would I have?

958
01:23:43,190 --> 01:23:46,985
The Virgin appeared
in order to save us

959
01:23:47,027 --> 01:23:48,987
from those circumstances.

960
01:23:49,029 --> 01:23:52,533
The Virgin appeared to save you from...
from your mother?

961
01:23:56,537 --> 01:23:57,704
Hmm.

962
01:23:58,580 --> 01:24:03,794
It appears that Jacinta
was the most mystic among you.

963
01:24:03,836 --> 01:24:04,878
[chuckles]

964
01:24:05,963 --> 01:24:07,297
Yes, she was.

965
01:24:08,465 --> 01:24:11,802
Maybe because she was younger.
She was only seven.

966
01:24:11,844 --> 01:24:15,264
Maybe because you two were older
and she was trying to outdo you.

967
01:24:15,305 --> 01:24:18,517
No. She was that way.

968
01:24:19,935 --> 01:24:21,812
She had a gift.

969
01:24:23,522 --> 01:24:27,943
Did you see her body
after she was exhumed?

970
01:24:27,985 --> 01:24:30,612
Yes, I saw it.
It was completely intact.

971
01:24:30,654 --> 01:24:33,073
And you naturally believe...

972
01:24:34,241 --> 01:24:36,577
it is just a coincidence?

973
01:24:37,411 --> 01:24:39,079
[laughs]

974
01:24:40,122 --> 01:24:41,498
No, it's different.

975
01:24:43,083 --> 01:24:45,836
I think it's incredible
and unexplainable.

976
01:24:45,878 --> 01:24:49,214
But not everything unexplainable
is necessarily transcendent.

977
01:24:50,257 --> 01:24:53,552
Sometimes
it's just that we are limited.

978
01:24:54,428 --> 01:25:00,017
Therefore, fortuitous,
unexplainable circumstances?

979
01:25:01,143 --> 01:25:02,394
[laughs]

980
01:25:03,187 --> 01:25:04,313
Sorry.

981
01:25:04,980 --> 01:25:06,190
[sighs]

982
01:25:06,899 --> 01:25:12,321
Sometimes I have to tease you.
Otherwise, I wouldn't be doing my job.

983
01:25:12,362 --> 01:25:15,866
Which one? Helping me with my book
or converting me?

984
01:25:18,327 --> 01:25:20,370
[boy] <i>Do what the Virgin tells you to!</i>

985
01:25:20,412 --> 01:25:21,622
Pray the rosary!

986
01:25:23,207 --> 01:25:26,043
Rosaries! Rosaries!

987
01:25:26,084 --> 01:25:27,586
Six cents!

988
01:25:27,628 --> 01:25:29,588
Would you like
the Virgin's rosary?

989
01:25:31,673 --> 01:25:34,218
Where are the seers?
It's almost midday.

990
01:25:34,259 --> 01:25:36,261
I don't know, madam.
Thank you.

991
01:25:36,303 --> 01:25:38,805
Rosaries! The Virgin's rosaries!

992
01:25:39,556 --> 01:25:42,976
- [church bell tolling]
- We came to see our children.

993
01:25:43,018 --> 01:25:44,603
We only take orders
from the captain.

994
01:25:45,020 --> 01:25:47,189
- Or the mayor.
- [António] The mayor fooled us.

995
01:25:47,231 --> 01:25:50,275
He told us he would have brought them
to Father Ferreira's house.

996
01:25:50,317 --> 01:25:52,152
To question them. And here he is.

997
01:25:52,194 --> 01:25:54,696
- Please, at least let me come in.
- [guard] No.

998
01:25:54,738 --> 01:25:57,366
You must let us in.
We need to speak to the mayor.

999
01:25:57,407 --> 01:25:59,076
That's impossible.

1000
01:25:59,117 --> 01:26:00,410
- I want to see our children!
- No.

1001
01:26:00,452 --> 01:26:02,579
- I want... My child is in there!
- António!

1002
01:26:02,621 --> 01:26:04,081
[shouting]

1003
01:26:04,122 --> 01:26:05,958
- My child is...
- António!

1004
01:26:05,999 --> 01:26:07,960
- Don't!
- No, no! Stand back.

1005
01:26:11,505 --> 01:26:13,006
[sighs]

1006
01:26:14,633 --> 01:26:17,177
[Artur] Go on, have some food.
Don't be afraid.

1007
01:26:27,229 --> 01:26:29,982
So, why are you doing this? Hmm?

1008
01:26:34,486 --> 01:26:35,821
Because I'm hungry.

1009
01:26:35,863 --> 01:26:36,989
[chuckles]

1010
01:26:39,032 --> 01:26:40,617
Not that.

1011
01:26:42,619 --> 01:26:46,248
When was the first time
you had the idea of seeing the lady?

1012
01:26:46,999 --> 01:26:48,500
Who is behind all of this?

1013
01:26:55,883 --> 01:26:57,050
[clears throat]

1014
01:26:57,092 --> 01:26:59,386
Your mother loved Manuel
very much.

1015
01:27:00,721 --> 01:27:02,389
Her only son.

1016
01:27:02,431 --> 01:27:05,392
I remember he was a smart boy.
Handsome too.

1017
01:27:06,018 --> 01:27:08,270
Your mother just wanted him
to come home.

1018
01:27:08,854 --> 01:27:11,732
For all that time,
it was as if you didn't even exist.

1019
01:27:13,901 --> 01:27:14,943
[clatters]

1020
01:27:14,985 --> 01:27:16,904
And now Manuel is dead.

1021
01:27:16,945 --> 01:27:19,823
And your mother blames you.
She's angry at you.

1022
01:27:22,576 --> 01:27:25,162
That must be very painful.
Isn't it?

1023
01:27:27,039 --> 01:27:28,415
Well, yes.

1024
01:27:30,083 --> 01:27:34,087
Yeah. I understand
what it means to, uh...

1025
01:27:34,963 --> 01:27:36,256
long for...

1026
01:27:38,133 --> 01:27:40,260
to wish for someone's love.

1027
01:27:42,054 --> 01:27:43,388
So, uh...

1028
01:27:44,598 --> 01:27:48,769
one day you were feeling
lonely and hurt.

1029
01:27:49,603 --> 01:27:52,481
And you imagined
another mother.

1030
01:27:53,440 --> 01:27:56,985
And I know you did tell your cousins,
"It's all just a game."

1031
01:27:57,027 --> 01:27:59,863
But little Jacinta, who worships you,
believes your game

1032
01:27:59,905 --> 01:28:02,199
- to the point it becomes real.
- That's not true!

1033
01:28:02,241 --> 01:28:03,617
I saw her.

1034
01:28:05,202 --> 01:28:08,247
But now, if you tell everyone
it was just a game,

1035
01:28:08,288 --> 01:28:11,375
you know they'll all be
disappointed and angry.

1036
01:28:11,416 --> 01:28:13,669
And you don't know
how to stop this game, do you?

1037
01:28:18,465 --> 01:28:20,133
I don't want to fool anyone.

1038
01:28:22,803 --> 01:28:24,972
I'm so sorry you couldn't see her.

1039
01:28:41,238 --> 01:28:43,657
- [door slams]
- [lock sets]

1040
01:29:02,593 --> 01:29:05,304
Thank you for coming all the way here
on such short notice.

1041
01:29:05,345 --> 01:29:08,056
The health authority
explained the urgency.

1042
01:29:08,098 --> 01:29:09,808
Your medical opinion
is very important to us,

1043
01:29:09,850 --> 01:29:12,186
and it will help us
resolve this matter.

1044
01:29:15,022 --> 01:29:18,650
[people praying]

1045
01:29:18,692 --> 01:29:20,110
[gasps]

1046
01:29:26,074 --> 01:29:27,367
[all] ...pray for us sinners,

1047
01:29:27,409 --> 01:29:30,871
now and at the hour of our death.
Amen.

1048
01:29:30,913 --> 01:29:34,499
Hail Mary, full of grace.
The Lord is with thee.

1049
01:29:34,541 --> 01:29:36,502
Blessed art thou among women

1050
01:29:36,543 --> 01:29:39,171
and blessed is the fruit
of thy womb, Jesus.

1051
01:29:39,213 --> 01:29:40,672
[praying continues]

1052
01:29:40,714 --> 01:29:42,674
Let me show you
where the children are.

1053
01:29:44,218 --> 01:29:47,513
Hail Mary, full of grace.
The Lord is with thee.

1054
01:29:48,347 --> 01:29:50,224
Blessed art thou amongst women

1055
01:29:50,265 --> 01:29:52,559
and blessed is the fruit
of thy womb, Jesus.

1056
01:29:53,477 --> 01:29:57,397
Holy Mary, Mother of God,
pray for us sinners.

1057
01:29:57,439 --> 01:30:00,776
Now and at the hour
of our death. Amen.

1058
01:30:01,777 --> 01:30:04,404
Hail Mary, full of grace.
The Lord is with thee.

1059
01:30:05,364 --> 01:30:07,199
[Lucia, crowd]
Blessed art thou amongst women

1060
01:30:07,241 --> 01:30:10,035
and blessed is the fruit
of thy womb, Jesus.

1061
01:30:10,077 --> 01:30:13,705
Holy Mary, Mother of God,
pray for us sinners.

1062
01:30:13,747 --> 01:30:16,917
Now and at the hour of our death. Amen.

1063
01:30:17,543 --> 01:30:21,004
Hail Mary, full of grace.
The Lord is with thee.

1064
01:30:21,046 --> 01:30:22,881
Blessed art thou amongst women...

1065
01:30:32,641 --> 01:30:34,101
I asked you
for one thing only:

1066
01:30:34,142 --> 01:30:36,270
not to let yourself be seen
with those people.

1067
01:30:39,606 --> 01:30:40,774
Free the children.

1068
01:30:42,484 --> 01:30:43,527
Let them go.

1069
01:30:43,569 --> 01:30:45,737
Adelina, they're being seen
by the psychiatrist.

1070
01:30:45,779 --> 01:30:48,198
Please don't worry.
I know what I'm doing. Just go home.

1071
01:30:48,240 --> 01:30:49,575
Are you sure you're doing this

1072
01:30:49,616 --> 01:30:51,910
just because of the pressure
coming from Lisbon?

1073
01:30:53,495 --> 01:30:55,622
You should be worrying
about our children.

1074
01:30:56,290 --> 01:30:58,125
Now leave me
and let me do my job.

1075
01:31:02,504 --> 01:31:04,131
Answer my question.

1076
01:31:07,467 --> 01:31:08,468
[sighs]

1077
01:31:11,555 --> 01:31:13,098
Release those children, Artur.

1078
01:31:14,183 --> 01:31:15,976
- There's a limit to everything.
- Exactly.

1079
01:31:16,018 --> 01:31:17,311
So please go home

1080
01:31:17,352 --> 01:31:19,813
and don't let anyone see you
with those people ever again.

1081
01:31:19,855 --> 01:31:22,149
- And don't you force me to choose.
- [knocking]

1082
01:31:23,859 --> 01:31:25,027
Mayor.

1083
01:31:26,945 --> 01:31:28,280
The doctor's ready
to see you now.

1084
01:31:29,489 --> 01:31:31,116
Please send him in.

1085
01:31:31,158 --> 01:31:33,869
If you could escort my wife,
she was about to leave us.

1086
01:31:36,038 --> 01:31:38,415
[man] Yes, sir. What about them?

1087
01:31:39,875 --> 01:31:41,585
- What should we do?
- Let them pray.

1088
01:31:42,169 --> 01:31:44,338
I'm sure they'll get tired
of it eventually.

1089
01:31:48,884 --> 01:31:50,969
[crowd continues praying, murmuring]

1090
01:31:54,181 --> 01:31:55,807
[murmuring dies down]

1091
01:31:59,645 --> 01:32:00,646
I'm sorry.

1092
01:32:04,274 --> 01:32:06,276
I spoke to them in detail.

1093
01:32:06,985 --> 01:32:11,615
I didn't find any type of pathology,
neither physical nor mental,

1094
01:32:12,241 --> 01:32:14,993
that could justify
a forced hospitalization.

1095
01:32:15,994 --> 01:32:17,871
You could still give me
some kind of proof

1096
01:32:17,913 --> 01:32:21,667
or a tool
to prove their dishonesty.

1097
01:32:21,708 --> 01:32:23,877
I mean, this tale would collapse
in no time.

1098
01:32:24,837 --> 01:32:29,842
The only thing I can give you is this copy
I prepared for the authorities in Lisbon.

1099
01:32:32,094 --> 01:32:33,387
Thank you, Doctor.

1100
01:32:33,428 --> 01:32:35,222
[Father Ferreira]
Glory be to the Father...

1101
01:32:35,889 --> 01:32:38,559
and to the Son and to the Holy Spirit.

1102
01:32:39,184 --> 01:32:41,353
[all] Glory be to the Father,

1103
01:32:41,395 --> 01:32:44,481
and to the Son and to the Holy Spirit.

1104
01:32:45,065 --> 01:32:46,191
Over there, children.

1105
01:32:46,233 --> 01:32:48,068
- Mama! Mama!
- Lucia!

1106
01:32:49,903 --> 01:32:50,946
Lucia!

1107
01:32:53,866 --> 01:32:55,242
- Mama!
- Lucia!

1108
01:32:55,284 --> 01:32:56,326
Oh!

1109
01:32:56,952 --> 01:32:58,579
[laughter]

1110
01:32:59,288 --> 01:33:00,497
Are you all right?

1111
01:33:01,373 --> 01:33:04,084
- [Lucia] I missed you.
- Oh, thank you. Thank you.

1112
01:33:05,252 --> 01:33:06,420
[sobbing]

1113
01:33:08,839 --> 01:33:09,882
I love you.

1114
01:33:09,923 --> 01:33:11,800
[coughing]

1115
01:33:25,480 --> 01:33:27,274
[dog barking]

1116
01:33:30,611 --> 01:33:33,071
[Lucia murmuring]

1117
01:33:33,113 --> 01:33:35,407
- [man] Goodbye.
- [Maria] Thank you, Doctor.

1118
01:33:35,449 --> 01:33:37,201
[labored breathing]

1119
01:33:46,460 --> 01:33:48,128
She is very weak.

1120
01:33:49,838 --> 01:33:51,590
Just a moment, please.

1121
01:33:51,632 --> 01:33:53,300
Get her something to eat.

1122
01:33:53,342 --> 01:33:56,762
And make sure
she gets some rest.

1123
01:33:56,803 --> 01:33:58,430
Try some steam inhalation.

1124
01:34:00,015 --> 01:34:01,600
[António] Can you please wait, Doctor?

1125
01:34:07,648 --> 01:34:09,149
- Thank you.
- Goodbye.

1126
01:34:10,108 --> 01:34:11,360
Thank you, Doctor.

1127
01:34:13,820 --> 01:34:15,197
[door opens]

1128
01:34:17,866 --> 01:34:18,909
[door closes]

1129
01:34:19,576 --> 01:34:22,663
We're in dire need now.
So where is your lady?

1130
01:34:22,704 --> 01:34:24,289
- [Carolina] Leave her alone.
- [Maria] Stop it.

1131
01:34:28,460 --> 01:34:30,963
I want you all here by my side.

1132
01:34:31,004 --> 01:34:32,381
All of you.

1133
01:34:32,422 --> 01:34:33,507
[labored breathing]

1134
01:34:34,174 --> 01:34:35,676
You, too, Lucia.

1135
01:34:38,220 --> 01:34:39,555
[António] Lucia.

1136
01:34:40,681 --> 01:34:41,765
Come.

1137
01:34:52,025 --> 01:34:54,069
[Maria] God has given me the blessing.

1138
01:34:54,111 --> 01:34:56,613
[gasping]

1139
01:34:57,364 --> 01:34:58,824
He wants to take me to Manuel.

1140
01:34:58,866 --> 01:35:01,493
[António] That's enough.
Maria, please.

1141
01:35:01,535 --> 01:35:03,203
Enough of this nonsense.

1142
01:35:04,705 --> 01:35:06,874
The doctor did not say
you were passing.

1143
01:35:08,333 --> 01:35:11,545
[wheezing, coughing]

1144
01:35:15,090 --> 01:35:16,258
[Maria] Lucia.

1145
01:35:17,926 --> 01:35:19,386
Where is she going?

1146
01:35:31,398 --> 01:35:33,108
[gasping]

1147
01:36:32,167 --> 01:36:33,794
[muttering]

1148
01:36:55,816 --> 01:36:56,984
Lucia.

1149
01:36:58,527 --> 01:36:59,528
Lucia.

1150
01:37:04,283 --> 01:37:05,909
I think it's time to go.

1151
01:37:08,787 --> 01:37:11,164
I'm sure Mama
is feeling better now.

1152
01:37:31,185 --> 01:37:32,227
[António] Father.

1153
01:37:32,269 --> 01:37:34,354
[Father Ferreira] António, I came
because I have some good news.

1154
01:37:35,105 --> 01:37:39,526
It's from Manuel.
He's alive. He's alive.

1155
01:37:40,194 --> 01:37:42,362
[Father Ferreira]
The military chaplain wrote the letter.

1156
01:37:42,404 --> 01:37:45,657
He says he's wounded,
but not seriously wounded.

1157
01:37:45,699 --> 01:37:47,117
Thank God for that.

1158
01:37:47,951 --> 01:37:49,536
Thank you.

1159
01:37:49,578 --> 01:37:53,040
Lucia. Manuel is alive.

1160
01:37:53,665 --> 01:37:55,042
[António] Manuel is alive!

1161
01:37:55,918 --> 01:37:57,377
Manuel is alive.

1162
01:37:58,337 --> 01:38:00,464
He's... He's alive.

1163
01:38:00,506 --> 01:38:02,716
Oh, he's alive.

1164
01:38:03,800 --> 01:38:06,887
[Nichols] It appears your prayers
have been answered.

1165
01:38:06,929 --> 01:38:11,225
My mother always said
I was not good at convincing people.

1166
01:38:11,266 --> 01:38:14,561
I have never thought it possible
to convince you.

1167
01:38:14,603 --> 01:38:16,563
You haven't.
Don't be getting too confident.

1168
01:38:19,399 --> 01:38:23,529
I hope our meetings will be good
for the writing of your book.

1169
01:38:24,196 --> 01:38:25,864
Not only in that.

1170
01:38:25,906 --> 01:38:28,742
[woman] Professor Nichols,
your taxi is here.

1171
01:38:29,493 --> 01:38:31,036
[Nichols] Thank you.
I'll be right out.

1172
01:38:31,662 --> 01:38:33,247
Thank you, Sister.

1173
01:38:34,540 --> 01:38:37,042
[Nichols] If I remember correctly,
there was a great controversy

1174
01:38:37,084 --> 01:38:39,419
over the fact
that the Virgin claimed

1175
01:38:39,461 --> 01:38:42,005
the war would end
on the day of the miracle.

1176
01:38:42,047 --> 01:38:44,258
[Lucia] It is appropriate to remind you...

1177
01:38:44,883 --> 01:38:46,927
[thunder rumbling]

1178
01:38:53,433 --> 01:38:56,144
[thunder continues rumbling]

1179
01:39:12,995 --> 01:39:14,746
We don't want to wait.

1180
01:39:14,788 --> 01:39:16,415
[woman] We're tired.

1181
01:39:16,456 --> 01:39:18,166
Nobody asked you to come!

1182
01:39:24,131 --> 01:39:27,509
She won't come.
It's raining too much.

1183
01:39:38,937 --> 01:39:42,983
[people chattering]

1184
01:39:59,458 --> 01:40:03,337
Six cents! Rosaries!

1185
01:40:03,378 --> 01:40:04,963
[man]
Rosaries!

1186
01:40:05,005 --> 01:40:07,966
Rosaries! Rosaries, six cents!

1187
01:40:08,008 --> 01:40:10,969
Rosaries!
Blessed by the seers themselves!

1188
01:40:11,011 --> 01:40:12,679
Go, go, shout more.

1189
01:40:12,721 --> 01:40:14,264
- Rosaries!
- Rosaries!

1190
01:40:14,306 --> 01:40:16,808
- Blessed by the seers themselves!
- Rosaries!

1191
01:40:16,850 --> 01:40:17,935
Rosaries!

1192
01:40:17,976 --> 01:40:19,520
Thank you for coming, sir.

1193
01:40:19,561 --> 01:40:21,813
- Have I missed anything?
- No.

1194
01:40:21,855 --> 01:40:25,150
Nothing has happened yet.
Just rain and people praying.

1195
01:40:25,192 --> 01:40:26,735
You wouldn't want
someone like me

1196
01:40:26,777 --> 01:40:29,738
to miss out writing about
this possible miracle.

1197
01:40:29,780 --> 01:40:30,781
No.

1198
01:40:31,198 --> 01:40:33,617
It's the only topic
being discussed in Lisbon.

1199
01:40:34,535 --> 01:40:37,037
[thunder continues rumbling]

1200
01:40:50,717 --> 01:40:53,220
[people chattering]

1201
01:41:36,805 --> 01:41:39,391
Hello, my children.

1202
01:41:40,184 --> 01:41:43,020
Thank you for coming to see me.

1203
01:41:51,445 --> 01:41:54,823
Can you please tell us who you are?
These people want to know.

1204
01:41:54,865 --> 01:41:57,993
- There she is.
- [all murmuring]

1205
01:42:06,001 --> 01:42:08,295
I am the Lady of the Rosary.

1206
01:42:10,130 --> 01:42:13,133
I am going to lead them
to my son

1207
01:42:13,800 --> 01:42:15,677
through peace and love.

1208
01:42:19,306 --> 01:42:22,100
She says
she's the Lady of the Rosary!

1209
01:42:22,142 --> 01:42:23,602
[crowd murmuring]

1210
01:42:23,644 --> 01:42:26,063
Rosaries, now ten cents!

1211
01:42:26,104 --> 01:42:29,983
She will lead us to her son
through peace and love.

1212
01:42:30,901 --> 01:42:33,612
They must not insult the Lord,

1213
01:42:33,654 --> 01:42:35,989
who is already far too insulted.

1214
01:42:37,407 --> 01:42:38,951
You have to pray.

1215
01:42:41,036 --> 01:42:44,206
[Lucia] Pray the rosary every day!

1216
01:42:44,248 --> 01:42:46,917
And you mustn't insult the Lord.

1217
01:42:46,959 --> 01:42:49,253
He's already far too insulted.

1218
01:42:53,423 --> 01:42:55,551
[no audible dialogue]

1219
01:42:56,301 --> 01:42:57,511
[chuckles]

1220
01:42:58,011 --> 01:43:01,431
- The war will end soon!
- [crowd murmuring]

1221
01:43:01,473 --> 01:43:03,851
[chattering, laughter]

1222
01:43:08,605 --> 01:43:11,817
And our soldiers are to return home
to their families.

1223
01:43:22,870 --> 01:43:24,329
Look at them.

1224
01:43:24,371 --> 01:43:27,040
A huge crowd of people
hanging on to every word

1225
01:43:27,082 --> 01:43:30,586
a little lying, stubborn
and ignorant girl is saying.

1226
01:43:33,714 --> 01:43:37,092
Some people
are never going to believe.

1227
01:43:39,386 --> 01:43:42,723
Even when standing
before the face of God.

1228
01:43:44,057 --> 01:43:45,058
Look.

1229
01:43:46,393 --> 01:43:47,394
The sun!

1230
01:43:48,604 --> 01:43:50,898
[all murmuring]

1231
01:43:59,156 --> 01:44:01,575
[gasps]

1232
01:44:17,758 --> 01:44:20,761
[whirring]

1233
01:44:48,830 --> 01:44:51,917
[all screaming]

1234
01:44:56,797 --> 01:44:58,841
[man] The sun is falling!

1235
01:45:02,469 --> 01:45:04,179
[screaming continues]

1236
01:45:04,221 --> 01:45:06,139
Move out of the way!
Move out of the way!

1237
01:45:06,765 --> 01:45:08,350
