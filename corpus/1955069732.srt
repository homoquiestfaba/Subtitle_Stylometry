1
00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:12,970
Is Riley here?

2
00:00:15,098 --> 00:00:16,098
Red alert!

3
00:00:17,058 --> 00:00:23,480
Boy. Boy. Boy. Boy. Boy.

4
00:00:23,565 --> 00:00:24,815
There's a boy in my house.

5
00:00:24,899 --> 00:00:27,317
I knew she was going skating,
but I thought it was with her friends.

6
00:00:27,402 --> 00:00:28,694
Why is there a boy in my house?

7
00:00:28,778 --> 00:00:31,530
This isn't a date, is it? I'll ask Riley.

8
00:00:32,949 --> 00:00:33,949
I don't like this.

9
00:00:34,034 --> 00:00:36,118
This can't be a date! She's only 12!

10
00:00:36,202 --> 00:00:39,747
Let's probe, but layer it
with cool words the kids say,

11
00:00:39,831 --> 00:00:41,123
so it's not obvious.

12
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:44,501
So, what's the dealio with Jordan?

13
00:00:44,586 --> 00:00:48,839
O- M-G, he is awesome-sauce
fo sheezy.

14
00:00:50,008 --> 00:00:51,800
Did she just say "fo sheezy"?

15
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:53,844
I don't understand. What's happening?

16
00:00:53,928 --> 00:00:56,972
This is just embarrassing.
I can't. I can't.

17
00:00:57,182 --> 00:00:58,182
Holla!

18
00:01:04,814 --> 00:01:06,231
I know what you're doing here, Jordan.

19
00:01:06,316 --> 00:01:08,650
You don't think that I know what
you know, but I know, you little punk!

20
00:01:08,735 --> 00:01:10,736
He's not good enough for Riley.
No one is!

21
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:12,071
Go back to jail!

22
00:01:12,155 --> 00:01:14,907
What are you looking for, Jordan?
Something to steal?

23
00:01:14,991 --> 00:01:16,575
- Like our daughter.
- Should we say something?

24
00:01:16,659 --> 00:01:18,368
No, no, no. He'll be expecting that.

25
00:01:18,453 --> 00:01:21,538
Give him the silent treatment.
He's about to crack, I can feel it.

26
00:01:26,211 --> 00:01:28,712
Whoa, dude! Awesome!

27
00:01:31,341 --> 00:01:33,842
Sir, no response.

28
00:01:33,968 --> 00:01:37,221
Two can play at your mind games,
Jordan. Intimidate!

29
00:01:43,436 --> 00:01:45,771
Dude, what's he looking at?

30
00:01:45,855 --> 00:01:47,856
Probably your dumb hat.

31
00:01:54,322 --> 00:01:56,573
Sir, intimidation is failing.

32
00:01:56,658 --> 00:01:58,659
Increase the pressure. Engage.

33
00:01:58,993 --> 00:02:03,330
So, Jordan,
what do you like to do for fun?

34
00:02:03,957 --> 00:02:05,833
I don't know. Stuff.

35
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:07,376
Sir, that sounds like backtalk.

36
00:02:07,669 --> 00:02:10,963
That's it! He's outta here!
Give him the boot.

37
00:02:11,047 --> 00:02:12,464
Yes, sir. Launching boot.

38
00:02:19,013 --> 00:02:22,558
On my mark. In five, four, three...

39
00:02:24,102 --> 00:02:26,562
I play in a band. That's fun.

40
00:02:27,147 --> 00:02:29,439
Wait. We were in a band.

41
00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:38,407
I was in a band, lead guitar.

42
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:40,909
Cool. I rock the bass.

43
00:02:41,494 --> 00:02:44,621
- We played a lot of AC/DC.
- Yeah, my favorite band is AC/DC.

44
00:02:44,706 --> 00:02:45,706
What.

45
00:02:46,082 --> 00:02:48,125
Mom, it's not a date.

46
00:02:48,209 --> 00:02:50,127
We're going skating
with a group of friends.

47
00:02:50,211 --> 00:02:53,172
Oh, fun. That'll be off the hook. L-O-L.

48
00:02:53,256 --> 00:02:54,381
Stop talking like that!

49
00:02:54,465 --> 00:02:55,465
Wait. Where's Jordan?

50
00:02:55,758 --> 00:02:57,509
Did you leave Jordan with Dad?

51
00:02:57,594 --> 00:02:58,760
Mom! This is so embarrassing.

52
00:02:58,845 --> 00:03:02,431
Riley, your father
would never do any...

53
00:03:05,685 --> 00:03:06,685
Yeah!

54
00:03:08,938 --> 00:03:09,938
Awesome.

55
00:03:10,607 --> 00:03:12,149
Bye, Mom. Bye, Dad.

56
00:03:12,275 --> 00:03:14,109
- Have fun.
- Peace out, my homies.

57
00:03:14,903 --> 00:03:17,112
You know, Jordan's a good kid.

58
00:03:17,238 --> 00:03:18,864
You're not so bad yourself.

59
00:03:18,948 --> 00:03:21,033
Sir, the wife has initiated contact.
What do we do?

60
00:03:21,534 --> 00:03:24,203
This is our chance. Give her the look.

61
00:03:28,875 --> 00:03:31,001
He's making that stupid face again.

62
00:03:31,127 --> 00:03:32,127
Should we smack him?

63
00:03:32,212 --> 00:03:34,713
Come on. He's adorable.

64
00:03:36,507 --> 00:03:37,799
There's the signal.

65
00:03:37,884 --> 00:03:39,468
We are go. Repeat, we are go.

66
00:03:39,594 --> 00:03:43,347
Contact in five, four, three, two...

67
00:04:27,141 --> 00:04:28,517
I'm good. You guys good?

68
00:04:28,601 --> 00:04:29,726
- Yeah. I'm good.
- Yeah, I'm good here.

69
00:04:29,811 --> 00:04:31,770
Good.

70
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:33,647
Okay, that's enough.

71
00:04:34,357 --> 00:04:38,360
Yeah. I'll go fix the table.
