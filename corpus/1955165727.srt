2
00:02:50,469 --> 00:02:51,798
Apologies, Miss...

3
00:02:52,023 --> 00:02:54,124
I didn’t know how
else to wake you.

4
00:02:54,237 --> 00:02:56,562
The Heelshires had to
step out for a moment.

5
00:02:56,964 --> 00:02:59,837
They beg your pardon, Miss, and
ask that you wait in the parlour.

6
00:03:00,181 --> 00:03:02,402
It’s like something out
of a storybook, isn't it?

7
00:03:02,827 --> 00:03:05,518
The Heelshires already
taken care of that.

8
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:08,199
- And I put your things inside.
- Thanks.

9
00:03:55,510 --> 00:03:57,274
Is anyone up there?

10
00:03:57,399 --> 00:03:58,419
Hi!

11
00:04:47,055 --> 00:04:48,708
Is anyone up here?

12
00:05:26,692 --> 00:05:27,920
Hi there.

13
00:05:29,475 --> 00:05:30,723
Sorry.

14
00:05:30,946 --> 00:05:34,778
Believe it or not, I was... I was
actually trying not to scare you.

15
00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:38,807
No, I'm sorry I jumped, I thought
I heard something upstairs, so...

16
00:05:39,517 --> 00:05:43,288
- You're right.
- Yes, sorry. It's so stupid.

17
00:05:43,659 --> 00:05:45,034
- Are you Mr. Heelshire?
- No.

18
00:05:45,036 --> 00:05:46,541
I know you are not. Yet.

19
00:05:46,566 --> 00:05:47,861
No, I’m the grocery boy.

20
00:05:48,135 --> 00:05:50,611
Grocery man.

21
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:52,545
I own the store actually.

22
00:05:53,128 --> 00:05:55,049
- Okay, I’m Malcolm by the way.
- Hi.

23
00:05:55,051 --> 00:05:57,612
-You must be here for the nanny's job.
-Yeah, Greta Evans.

24
00:05:57,713 --> 00:06:00,241
I’ve got some groceries to unpack
downstairs, if you want to join me?

25
00:06:00,242 --> 00:06:02,913
I can give you a tour of
such exotic locations...

26
00:06:03,538 --> 00:06:05,916
...as the pantry and bread bin.

27
00:06:05,975 --> 00:06:07,332
Is that interests you?

28
00:06:07,357 --> 00:06:09,181
Sounds great. Sure.
Lead the way.

29
00:06:09,952 --> 00:06:12,490
- You are American, yeah?
- Yeah.

30
00:06:12,714 --> 00:06:15,014
My first trip to the UK.

31
00:06:15,092 --> 00:06:16,594
Alright, let me guess...

32
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:18,996
California, right?

33
00:06:19,885 --> 00:06:20,908
Montana.

34
00:06:20,933 --> 00:06:22,782
- In this.
- Yeah. Those in the basket.

35
00:06:22,984 --> 00:06:25,934
I’m usually so good at these things.
I’ve got a touch of the gift.

36
00:06:25,936 --> 00:06:27,005
The gift?

37
00:06:27,057 --> 00:06:29,701
Prognosticator. Clairvoyant.
Whatever you like to call it.

38
00:06:29,703 --> 00:06:31,550
I had a grandmother
that read tea-leaves.

39
00:06:31,551 --> 00:06:33,162
My mother read palms, so...

40
00:06:33,926 --> 00:06:35,542
Okay, what do you read?

41
00:06:35,767 --> 00:06:37,442
- Me?
- Yeah.

42
00:06:41,169 --> 00:06:42,365
Chewing gum.

43
00:06:42,889 --> 00:06:44,289
No kidding.

44
00:06:44,584 --> 00:06:47,324
We don’t get to choose
our gifts, Miss Evans.

45
00:06:47,349 --> 00:06:48,997
Come on, if you...
If you’ll allow me...

46
00:06:49,022 --> 00:06:51,174
- Let me show you.
- Allow you to...

47
00:06:52,059 --> 00:06:55,258
Yeah, I am gonna read your gum.
I'm a professional, trust me.

48
00:06:55,282 --> 00:06:56,482
Okay.

49
00:06:56,906 --> 00:06:58,106
Oh My God.

50
00:06:58,530 --> 00:06:59,571
Alright.

51
00:07:00,396 --> 00:07:01,454
Okay.

52
00:07:02,657 --> 00:07:04,287
Interesting teeth marks.

53
00:07:05,082 --> 00:07:08,097
I see that you’re a writer,

54
00:07:08,290 --> 00:07:10,829
from Phoenix, Montana.

55
00:07:10,831 --> 00:07:13,924
It looks like you’ve come here to be
inspired by the English countryside.

56
00:07:13,926 --> 00:07:17,287
To get away from the hustle and
bustle of your life in the U.S. of A.

57
00:07:17,289 --> 00:07:19,445
- No.
- Close?

58
00:07:20,203 --> 00:07:22,725
Not at all. No.

59
00:07:23,001 --> 00:07:24,694
- Okay, one more try.
- Okay.

60
00:07:24,695 --> 00:07:26,287
Okay? Just one.

61
00:07:27,781 --> 00:07:30,087
Okay, Okay, I see what went wrong.

62
00:07:30,088 --> 00:07:31,893
It's very... It's
very obvious now.

63
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:35,214
I see a dark past.

64
00:07:35,221 --> 00:07:37,558
On the run from someone, are we?

65
00:07:38,393 --> 00:07:39,563
That's what it looks like.

66
00:07:43,181 --> 00:07:44,818
Absolutely not.

67
00:07:48,637 --> 00:07:50,688
I’m afraid that was my
best attempt at flirting.

68
00:07:50,689 --> 00:07:53,148
Believe it or not I’m actually
considered charming in this country.

69
00:07:53,174 --> 00:07:54,474
It's okay.

70
00:07:54,657 --> 00:07:57,969
It’s amazing that any of us manage
to procreate at all really.

71
00:07:57,971 --> 00:08:01,200
- Bread?
- Yeah, in the cupboard behind you.

72
00:08:06,437 --> 00:08:09,351
So what’s... what's
the family like?

73
00:08:09,850 --> 00:08:12,297
Well they’re nice, you know...
They're...

74
00:08:12,822 --> 00:08:14,148
There very generous.

75
00:08:14,172 --> 00:08:16,358
As good a people as
you’ll ever hope to meet.

76
00:08:16,456 --> 00:08:17,731
And their son?

77
00:08:18,056 --> 00:08:20,365
- Brahms?
- Brahms.

78
00:08:20,808 --> 00:08:22,159
He is...

79
00:08:22,898 --> 00:08:25,769
I’m not sure quite how
to explain it, but...

80
00:08:27,898 --> 00:08:29,330
Mrs. Heelshire.

81
00:08:30,290 --> 00:08:33,349
It’s so nice to
finally meet you.

82
00:08:34,337 --> 00:08:36,503
Where are your shoes?

83
00:08:39,607 --> 00:08:42,012
Brahms is very excited
to meet you, Miss Evans.

84
00:08:42,037 --> 00:08:44,589
He’s never met an
American before.

85
00:08:44,591 --> 00:08:46,834
I’m very excited
to meet him too.

86
00:08:46,982 --> 00:08:50,935
I was sure I left my
shoes right here.

87
00:08:52,049 --> 00:08:55,809
They’ll turn up. It’s Brahms.
He can be playful.

88
00:08:56,139 --> 00:08:59,401
- I assume you brought other shoes?
- Yes.

89
00:09:00,003 --> 00:09:03,369
Let's hurry up. We've kept
them waiting long enough.

90
00:09:04,405 --> 00:09:08,463
Her name is Miss Evans. We want you
to be on your very best behaviour.

91
00:09:12,347 --> 00:09:13,747
Daddy?

92
00:09:15,771 --> 00:09:19,171
Miss Evans, allow me to introduce
Mr. Heelshire.

93
00:09:19,372 --> 00:09:20,762
Miss Evans.

94
00:09:20,926 --> 00:09:22,243
And this...

95
00:09:22,668 --> 00:09:25,096
...is our son, Brahms.

96
00:09:41,758 --> 00:09:43,193
So you’ve met Brahms then?

97
00:09:46,862 --> 00:09:48,393
How are you doing, Brahms?

98
00:09:50,860 --> 00:09:53,674
Now, you take it
easy on Miss Evans.

99
00:09:53,699 --> 00:09:56,622
She’s traveled a long
way just to meet you.

100
00:09:58,312 --> 00:10:00,424
I’ll be off then. The
bill is on the table.

101
00:10:00,503 --> 00:10:03,319
Pleasure to meet you, Miss Evans.
Hope to see you on my next deliver.

102
00:10:03,382 --> 00:10:05,315
- Thank you, Malcolm.
- Of course.

103
00:10:21,774 --> 00:10:23,798
It’s so nice to
meet you, Brahms.

104
00:10:24,286 --> 00:10:26,402
I hope you and I can be friends.

105
00:10:29,022 --> 00:10:32,755
Daddy, will you please take Miss
Evans things up to her room, please?

106
00:10:32,784 --> 00:10:36,051
Miss Evans, we might as well get
started. I have a lot to show you.

107
00:10:37,447 --> 00:10:39,193
You’ll be all alone out here.

108
00:10:39,194 --> 00:10:40,811
Do you think you can manage?

109
00:10:40,812 --> 00:10:42,242
Yeah, of course.

110
00:10:42,370 --> 00:10:45,569
We’ve had a number of potential
nannies come through already.

111
00:10:45,894 --> 00:10:48,800
Brahms rejected them all.
Though...

112
00:10:48,846 --> 00:10:53,411
There were nearly as young
or as pretty as you.

113
00:10:53,427 --> 00:10:57,754
You’ll wake him at 7:00 each
morning and you will dress him.

114
00:10:58,825 --> 00:11:01,755
You’ll find his cleaning
clothes behind you.

115
00:11:06,612 --> 00:11:08,352
So... So I should...?

116
00:11:08,910 --> 00:11:10,886
Wake him up and dress
him, Miss Evans.

117
00:11:10,911 --> 00:11:13,449
There’s no better way
to learn than by doing.

118
00:11:16,251 --> 00:11:17,988
Wake up, Brahms.

119
00:11:18,256 --> 00:11:21,143
Well, I don’t know about you, but
that certainly wouldn’t wake me.

120
00:11:23,381 --> 00:11:28,100
- It’s time to wake up, Brahms.
- He is not a baby, Miss Evans.

121
00:11:28,102 --> 00:11:30,342
You needn’t be afraid
of hurting him.

122
00:11:33,469 --> 00:11:34,745
Excuse me.

123
00:11:36,796 --> 00:11:41,745
Now, let’s show Miss Evans
how we get you dressed.

124
00:11:41,746 --> 00:11:45,362
I’d let her do it herself, but I’m
afraid we’d be here all afternoon.

125
00:11:47,027 --> 00:11:50,686
Brahms has three hours of
lessons five days a week,

126
00:11:50,688 --> 00:11:52,372
and I like to start by
reading some poetry.

127
00:11:52,373 --> 00:11:54,329
Do you know any, Miss Evans?

128
00:11:54,644 --> 00:11:56,949
I know all the words to
"Green Eggs and Ham".

129
00:11:58,568 --> 00:12:01,462
Well, it doesn’t have to
be poetry, of course.

130
00:12:01,523 --> 00:12:04,754
Any of these books will
do, but you must...

131
00:12:04,779 --> 00:12:07,752
...read in a loud, clear voice.

132
00:12:07,754 --> 00:12:09,191
Yes, of course.

133
00:12:12,906 --> 00:12:16,300
- Yes. Of course!
- Excellent.

134
00:12:16,423 --> 00:12:19,707
Next is music appreciation.

135
00:12:20,108 --> 00:12:21,299
Brahms!

136
00:12:21,624 --> 00:12:25,209
You must sit up straight,

137
00:12:25,734 --> 00:12:28,502
like a good little  boy.

138
00:12:29,222 --> 00:12:31,599
Music, Miss Evans.

139
00:12:31,901 --> 00:12:35,252
I don’t know how Brahms would
go on without his music.

140
00:12:35,677 --> 00:12:37,203
It’s his world.

141
00:12:37,205 --> 00:12:41,076
Of course, he likes it rather
louder than I prefer, but...

142
00:12:41,347 --> 00:12:46,167
...it gives him so much joy I
don’t dare take it away from him.

143
00:13:06,926 --> 00:13:09,380
We don’t throw any food out
in this house, Miss Evans.

144
00:13:09,381 --> 00:13:11,140
This is a country house.

145
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:14,268
Do you know what that means?

146
00:13:14,593 --> 00:13:15,668
No.

147
00:13:15,992 --> 00:13:19,348
It means we are in constant
battle with the outside elements.

148
00:13:19,350 --> 00:13:22,227
Weather, plants, vermin.

149
00:13:22,252 --> 00:13:24,593
Especially vermin, Miss Evans.

150
00:13:24,595 --> 00:13:28,715
And so we take certain
measures against them.

151
00:13:29,952 --> 00:13:31,905
Hello darling.

152
00:13:33,545 --> 00:13:36,866
Mr. Heelshire will explain
the rest of your duties.

153
00:13:36,891 --> 00:13:39,625
And food goes in here.

154
00:13:41,205 --> 00:13:42,334
Thank you.

155
00:13:42,659 --> 00:13:46,044
Now, I’ll show you the traps.

156
00:13:50,203 --> 00:13:52,829
As we do our best to
keep up the house,

157
00:13:52,830 --> 00:13:55,327
by the way, we don’t use
the fireplaces anymore.

158
00:13:55,353 --> 00:13:58,084
Bit of a hazard.
And regrettably,

159
00:13:58,085 --> 00:14:00,434
the last tradesman
we had actually...

160
00:14:01,183 --> 00:14:03,539
he managed to paint
the windows shut.

161
00:14:03,587 --> 00:14:07,437
Personally, I don’t think that
all of this is necessary, but...

162
00:14:07,570 --> 00:14:11,956
...Mrs. Heelshire is convinced that
the rats will get into the walls.

163
00:14:12,058 --> 00:14:14,710
And Brahms, of course he’s never
been very fond of animals.

164
00:14:14,735 --> 00:14:16,983
He has always been
very shy, you see.

165
00:14:17,241 --> 00:14:18,710
Very timid.

166
00:14:19,063 --> 00:14:21,686
I know how this must
look to you, Miss Evans.

167
00:14:21,687 --> 00:14:25,093
And to be completely honest I’m
not sure how all came to this.

168
00:14:25,094 --> 00:14:28,569
Little by little and then
all at once, I suppose.

169
00:14:30,921 --> 00:14:35,232
What I’m trying to say, is that whatever
it might look like on the outside,

170
00:14:35,932 --> 00:14:37,577
our son is here.

171
00:14:38,402 --> 00:14:40,348
He’s very much with us.

172
00:14:41,081 --> 00:14:44,211
- Do you understand, Miss Evans?
- Yes.

173
00:14:44,513 --> 00:14:47,331
Good. All good.
That’s very good.

174
00:14:51,277 --> 00:14:55,623
"Gentle Jesus, meek and mild,
look upon a little child.

175
00:14:55,624 --> 00:15:00,054
"Pity my simplicity. Suffer
me to come to Thee."

176
00:15:00,465 --> 00:15:04,162
God bless Mommy.
God bless Daddy.

177
00:15:04,431 --> 00:15:06,331
God bless Greta.

178
00:15:06,707 --> 00:15:08,433
God bless Me.

179
00:15:08,735 --> 00:15:10,219
- Amen.
- Amen.

180
00:15:10,221 --> 00:15:12,695
You were such a good boy today,
Brahms.

181
00:15:12,697 --> 00:15:15,257
You behaved like a little gentleman.

182
00:15:15,382 --> 00:15:17,287
Mommy is so proud of you.

183
00:15:20,869 --> 00:15:24,250
Could you give us a moment alone
to speak to Brahms privately?

184
00:15:24,275 --> 00:15:25,455
Yeah, sure.

185
00:15:48,260 --> 00:15:50,329
He wants you, Miss Evans.

186
00:15:50,754 --> 00:15:53,462
He’s chosen you if
you’ll have him.

187
00:16:05,518 --> 00:16:08,653
<i>I don’t know. This whole
thing is just creepy.</i>

188
00:16:09,523 --> 00:16:11,996
A huge house in the middle
of nowhere, no neighbors,

189
00:16:11,997 --> 00:16:14,650
the windows don’t even open,
no cell service, no Wi-Fi.

190
00:16:14,699 --> 00:16:16,511
<i>Greta you know you
needed to get away.</i>

191
00:16:16,513 --> 00:16:18,466
<i>This is perfect for you.</i>

192
00:16:18,491 --> 00:16:19,929
And taking advantage of them?

193
00:16:19,931 --> 00:16:22,699
<i>No, you just been paid to babysit...
the doll.</i>

194
00:16:22,724 --> 00:16:24,389
You should see the
way they talk to it.

195
00:16:24,390 --> 00:16:27,166
<i>Yes, it’s a little creepy, but
it’s only for a few months.</i>

196
00:16:27,170 --> 00:16:29,172
<i>You can handle this.</i>

197
00:16:29,174 --> 00:16:30,959
<i>Greta, you need this money.</i>

198
00:16:30,984 --> 00:16:33,388
<i>- Start over. Forget what happened.</i>
- You’re right.

199
00:16:33,926 --> 00:16:37,099
<i>- You’re gonna be okay.</i>
- Right.

200
00:16:38,183 --> 00:16:40,909
- What?
<i>- It’s Cole.</i>

201
00:16:41,444 --> 00:16:43,353
<i>He’s been calling non-stop.</i>

202
00:16:44,016 --> 00:16:46,610
<i>He even came by the house, he
scared Morgan half-to-death.</i>

203
00:16:46,612 --> 00:16:48,436
- What’d you tell him?
<i>- Nothing.</i>

204
00:16:48,447 --> 00:16:50,429
<i>And I’m not going to
tell him anything.</i>

205
00:16:50,710 --> 00:16:53,334
<i>I guess he doesn’t care about
the restraining order.</i>

206
00:16:53,536 --> 00:16:56,544
- Okay. Don’t engage, don’t...
- Okay.

207
00:16:56,831 --> 00:16:59,025
If he asks tell him you
don’t know where I am.

208
00:16:59,027 --> 00:17:01,013
- I know, I know.
- You know that, sorry.

209
00:17:01,015 --> 00:17:02,835
<i>I can’t stand to see
you get hurt again.</i>

210
00:17:29,517 --> 00:17:30,917
<i>No!</i>

211
00:17:31,142 --> 00:17:34,042
How could you? What
have you done?

212
00:17:34,511 --> 00:17:36,687
Wait till I tell daddy.

213
00:17:42,163 --> 00:17:44,381
Mommy must go now.

214
00:17:44,537 --> 00:17:46,893
You have to be a good boy.

215
00:17:47,598 --> 00:17:49,399
Because you promised us.

216
00:17:49,691 --> 00:17:51,723
I apologize for the
rush, Miss Evans.

217
00:17:51,725 --> 00:17:54,548
It’s so long since we’ve been on
holiday and we’re anxious to be off.

218
00:17:54,549 --> 00:17:57,477
Besides Brahms seems so...
so fond of you.

219
00:17:57,479 --> 00:18:00,674
I only wish we had
an opportunity to...

220
00:18:00,947 --> 00:18:03,314
...to explain to you
the idiosyncrasy...

221
00:18:03,315 --> 00:18:06,351
...of a child as unique
as our Brahms. But...

222
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:08,136
...you’ll figure them out by now.

223
00:18:08,137 --> 00:18:10,281
I’m sure. While simply to...

224
00:18:10,506 --> 00:18:12,160
...help you along.

225
00:18:12,689 --> 00:18:14,418
A schedule. With rules.

226
00:18:14,420 --> 00:18:17,271
Mrs. Heelshire she was kind
enough to write one out, you see.

227
00:18:17,272 --> 00:18:19,899
Now, may seem a bit silly, but
it is important that you...

228
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:22,324
...follow them because Brahms
is not like other children.

229
00:18:22,372 --> 00:18:24,544
He can be... particular.

230
00:18:24,646 --> 00:18:28,411
I’m afraid we may have indulged
him a bit over the years.

231
00:18:37,002 --> 00:18:39,002
Go on, mommy!

232
00:18:39,027 --> 00:18:41,749
Malcolm will be by once
a week with groceries,

233
00:18:41,974 --> 00:18:43,532
and of course your payment.

234
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:46,144
And I’m sure that he can
answer any other...

235
00:18:46,145 --> 00:18:47,641
...questions that you might...

236
00:18:47,790 --> 00:18:51,101
...that you might have. I’m sorry,
I’m... I’m a bit off today. It’s...

237
00:18:51,126 --> 00:18:54,187
It’s so long since
we’ve gone anywhere.

238
00:18:59,676 --> 00:19:02,143
Be good to him and
he’ll be good to you.

239
00:19:02,892 --> 00:19:04,254
Be bad to him...

240
00:19:04,579 --> 00:19:05,854
She will...

241
00:19:05,879 --> 00:19:08,240
...be good to him,
won’t you Miss Evans?

242
00:19:08,242 --> 00:19:11,421
Yes. I’ll treat him like my own.

243
00:19:20,885 --> 00:19:23,122
I’m so sorry.

244
00:19:23,347 --> 00:19:25,941
Come along my dear,
it’s time we left.

245
00:20:15,765 --> 00:20:18,626
No offense Brahms, but
you kinda creep me out.

246
00:25:35,257 --> 00:25:38,979
Jesus Greta. You just got here
and you’re already cracking up.

247
00:26:38,188 --> 00:26:41,732
<i>Hey, it’s Sandy. Leave
a message...or don’t.</i>

248
00:26:42,067 --> 00:26:44,187
<i>Hey, it’s me. Again.</i>

249
00:26:44,812 --> 00:26:46,520
<i>Call me when you can.</i>

250
00:26:46,539 --> 00:26:49,066
And send me some more magazines, too.
Anything with...

251
00:26:49,591 --> 00:26:51,289
Actually anything.

252
00:26:53,313 --> 00:26:54,513
Okay.

253
00:26:58,994 --> 00:27:00,207
Hello?

254
00:27:01,631 --> 00:27:02,931
Sandy?

255
00:27:06,955 --> 00:27:08,255
Cole?

256
00:27:35,894 --> 00:27:37,138
You need a lift?

257
00:27:41,710 --> 00:27:43,771
So all that food
just goes to waste?

258
00:27:43,796 --> 00:27:44,873
No, not all of it.

259
00:27:45,075 --> 00:27:47,287
Mr. Heelshire eats some of them.

260
00:27:47,312 --> 00:27:49,628
He’s always been the less
strict one about all of this.

261
00:27:50,161 --> 00:27:51,936
You could have
warned me, you know.

262
00:27:52,279 --> 00:27:54,861
- And ruin the surprise?
- Thanks.

263
00:27:55,872 --> 00:27:57,602
Speaking of surprises.

264
00:27:58,027 --> 00:28:00,446
Your first weeks pay.
Good job, well done.

265
00:28:00,648 --> 00:28:01,715
Thank you.

266
00:28:02,904 --> 00:28:06,363
- But I have to ask you.
- Yes, I am single.

267
00:28:06,888 --> 00:28:08,782
Believe it or not.

268
00:28:09,456 --> 00:28:12,418
- What’s the story with the doll?
- Yeah.

269
00:28:13,170 --> 00:28:16,407
It was a fire. Brahms
didn’t make it out.

270
00:28:16,974 --> 00:28:20,101
On its eighth birthday.
Such a tragedy.

271
00:28:21,831 --> 00:28:24,347
And the doll turned up
not while after that.

272
00:28:25,652 --> 00:28:28,522
I know it must seem strange.
I mean it is bloody strange.

273
00:28:29,009 --> 00:28:30,356
It’s all harmless.

274
00:28:30,558 --> 00:28:32,100
A way to cope. I can’t imagine...

275
00:28:32,125 --> 00:28:33,930
...what it must be
like to lose a child.

276
00:28:36,839 --> 00:28:38,448
So he died twenty years ago.

277
00:28:38,773 --> 00:28:40,683
He’d be about your age.

278
00:28:41,008 --> 00:28:43,065
They’ve lived like
this for twenty years?

279
00:28:44,774 --> 00:28:47,546
And they’ve been looking
for a nanny the last year.

280
00:28:49,010 --> 00:28:51,403
You’re probably going mad
in this house, aren’t you?

281
00:28:51,405 --> 00:28:54,677
It might be good to get out. I can
show you our world-famous nightlife.

282
00:28:54,803 --> 00:28:58,173
I know you can not just let Brahms,
but I won’t tell if you want.

283
00:28:59,043 --> 00:29:00,143
I just...

284
00:29:00,668 --> 00:29:02,607
- I just got out of a thing.
- No.

285
00:29:02,932 --> 00:29:04,650
This is not a thing.

286
00:29:05,323 --> 00:29:08,046
No, I assure you of that.
This is...

287
00:29:08,724 --> 00:29:12,950
...professional courtesy seeing as we’re
employed by the same people.

288
00:29:12,952 --> 00:29:17,509
It’s a duty is what it is. I will
take no pleasure in it whatsoever,

289
00:29:17,510 --> 00:29:19,066
I promise.

290
00:29:20,205 --> 00:29:22,588
- Yeah?
- Okay, Yeah.

291
00:29:30,692 --> 00:29:33,958
<i>Do you realize that’s more money
than I make an entire month?</i>

292
00:29:34,008 --> 00:29:36,783
- And they paid you in cash?
- Yeah.

293
00:29:37,208 --> 00:29:38,687
In pounds.

294
00:29:39,289 --> 00:29:42,471
<i>- What are you doing?</i>
- I’m just getting dressed.

295
00:29:42,473 --> 00:29:44,766
Malcolm is gonna give me a
tour of the town.

296
00:29:44,768 --> 00:29:46,990
<i>- Are you going on a date?</i>
- It’s not a date.

297
00:29:46,992 --> 00:29:49,032
We don’t call it a date anyway.

298
00:29:49,034 --> 00:29:50,864
<i>- Really?</i>
- It’s more of a professional...

299
00:29:50,989 --> 00:29:53,255
- ...courtesy.
<i>-  How is that not a date?</i>

300
00:29:53,357 --> 00:29:55,196
Well, we work for the
same people, don’t we?

301
00:29:55,197 --> 00:29:56,273
<i>Yeah, okay.</i>

302
00:29:56,274 --> 00:29:59,872
- You gonna wear your coral dress?
- I don’t know. I’ ll figure it out.

303
00:30:00,347 --> 00:30:03,297
Let me guess. You’re drinking
a nice glass of red wine?

304
00:30:03,298 --> 00:30:04,482
Maybe.

305
00:30:04,548 --> 00:30:06,923
<i>I know you’re going
on a date, Greti.</i>

306
00:30:08,455 --> 00:30:10,563
<i>I thinκ it is good
that you’re going out.</i>

307
00:30:10,688 --> 00:30:14,316
<i>You don’t have to deny it
because he is the grocery man.</i>

308
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:20,600
<i>Greta?</i>

309
00:30:23,525 --> 00:30:25,447
<i>Are you there?</i>

310
00:30:27,652 --> 00:30:29,184
- Sorry.
<i>- What happened?</i>

311
00:30:29,275 --> 00:30:31,760
- Nothing. It’s Brahms.
<i>- Brahms?</i>

312
00:30:32,423 --> 00:30:33,945
The doll.

313
00:32:51,069 --> 00:32:52,899
My clothes.

314
00:33:11,109 --> 00:33:12,181
Hello?

315
00:33:15,484 --> 00:33:17,846
Malcolm, if that’s
you, this isn’t funny.

316
00:33:21,278 --> 00:33:23,225
Look, is somebody up there?

317
00:33:47,149 --> 00:33:48,149
Hello?

318
00:33:58,373 --> 00:34:00,073
Is anybody here?

319
00:34:37,705 --> 00:34:39,105
Malcolm!

320
00:34:39,830 --> 00:34:41,097
Up here!

321
00:34:41,521 --> 00:34:43,021
Malcolm!

322
00:34:46,645 --> 00:34:48,145
No! Malcolm!

323
00:35:16,127 --> 00:35:17,896
Oh my God, up here!

324
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:22,620
Malcolm!

325
00:35:29,344 --> 00:35:30,844
Greta!

326
00:35:45,568 --> 00:35:48,068
Malcolm! Malcolm!

327
00:38:23,386 --> 00:38:25,193
Did you spend the
night up there?

328
00:38:25,518 --> 00:38:28,142
What kind a girl goes
into someone’s attic?

329
00:38:28,605 --> 00:38:31,366
I bet no one has been
up there for years.

330
00:38:38,261 --> 00:38:40,434
Well, that’s one mystery solved.

331
00:38:40,872 --> 00:38:43,122
Let me check the
rest of the house.

332
00:38:58,055 --> 00:38:59,555
<i>So, Greta...</i>

333
00:38:59,980 --> 00:39:02,592
I’ve checked every nook and
cranny in this very lovely...

334
00:39:02,593 --> 00:39:04,342
...and very weird large house.

335
00:39:04,367 --> 00:39:06,085
And the windows
are sealed tight.

336
00:39:06,086 --> 00:39:07,460
The house is clear, okay?

337
00:39:07,808 --> 00:39:10,102
There was someone
in here, I know it.

338
00:39:10,592 --> 00:39:12,011
My clothes...

339
00:39:12,402 --> 00:39:15,705
You know, I used to
sleep-walk when I was a boy.

340
00:39:16,608 --> 00:39:18,438
I wasn’t sleep-walking.

341
00:39:18,439 --> 00:39:20,272
I could stay for a bit.

342
00:39:20,273 --> 00:39:23,040
Make sure we don’t have some very
polite burglar on our hands.

343
00:39:23,041 --> 00:39:26,162
Coming in, taking nothing and then locking
up after himself before he leaves.

344
00:39:26,952 --> 00:39:28,777
It’s really no problem.
I’m here anyway.

345
00:39:28,802 --> 00:39:31,098
- You’re sure.
- Absolutely.

346
00:39:31,522 --> 00:39:32,822
Okay.

347
00:39:35,828 --> 00:39:38,611
You've played this before.

348
00:39:38,710 --> 00:39:40,840
Let me know when you are
ready to play for money.

349
00:39:40,865 --> 00:39:41,974
No, thanks.

350
00:39:42,897 --> 00:39:44,175
So,

351
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:46,188
tell me about Brahms.

352
00:39:47,127 --> 00:39:49,416
I told you about all I know.

353
00:39:49,948 --> 00:39:52,648
That was a truly
terrible poker face.

354
00:39:54,772 --> 00:39:56,594
Alright. What do
you want to know?

355
00:39:56,799 --> 00:39:58,158
What he was like?

356
00:39:58,583 --> 00:40:00,241
The real Brahms.

357
00:40:01,519 --> 00:40:04,209
You need to know there is
two types of talk in town.

358
00:40:04,210 --> 00:40:06,208
In this, polite
talk and pub talk.

359
00:40:06,244 --> 00:40:07,339
You know?

360
00:40:07,340 --> 00:40:10,215
And the truth is
somewhere in between.

361
00:40:10,230 --> 00:40:12,074
Okay, what was the polite talk?

362
00:40:13,422 --> 00:40:16,161
That he was a lovely lad
and it’s a tragedy...

363
00:40:16,162 --> 00:40:18,839
...that he was taken
at such a young age.

364
00:40:19,387 --> 00:40:20,947
And the pub talk?

365
00:40:20,949 --> 00:40:23,141
Well, you know, that we
wasn’t such a lovely lad.

366
00:40:23,820 --> 00:40:26,326
That he was strange.

367
00:40:27,345 --> 00:40:29,080
What’s the truth?

368
00:40:35,844 --> 00:40:38,229
You know, one day I came
out here for a delivery.

369
00:40:38,231 --> 00:40:40,471
I didn’t know it at the time,
but it was Brahms birthday,

370
00:40:40,472 --> 00:40:41,473
or would have been.

371
00:40:41,594 --> 00:40:45,385
Mrs. Heelshire she was in the sitting
room, opening presents with the doll.

372
00:40:46,034 --> 00:40:47,948
And Mr. Heelshire...

373
00:40:49,362 --> 00:40:50,881
...he was in here.

374
00:40:51,887 --> 00:40:53,838
Off his-pickle.

375
00:40:54,817 --> 00:40:58,172
Drunk and mumbling to himself,

376
00:40:58,176 --> 00:41:00,307
"He couldn’t do it anymore."

377
00:41:00,385 --> 00:41:02,428
I told him I’ll
come back, he said:

378
00:41:02,430 --> 00:41:05,202
“No, no, come in. You know, have a
drink with an old man.” So I do.

379
00:41:05,203 --> 00:41:07,120
Well, we get a
couple of drinks in,

380
00:41:07,225 --> 00:41:10,154
chatting about the weather
and so on and finally...

381
00:41:10,843 --> 00:41:13,666
...I get the courage to ask
him that exact question.

382
00:41:13,986 --> 00:41:16,619
What was Brahms, the
real Brahms like.

383
00:41:18,482 --> 00:41:20,435
He just looks at me this...

384
00:41:20,460 --> 00:41:22,217
...you know, this
heartbroken look.

385
00:41:23,182 --> 00:41:26,176
He made me sorry I even asked.
He said one word.

386
00:41:27,742 --> 00:41:29,887
"Odd", he says.

387
00:41:30,376 --> 00:41:31,445
Odd.

388
00:41:33,242 --> 00:41:34,777
<i>And that was it.</i>

389
00:41:35,202 --> 00:41:38,202
<i>Which I suppose is all the
answer ever going to get.</i>

390
00:41:41,405 --> 00:41:42,544
My serve.

391
00:41:44,641 --> 00:41:46,793
Are you sure you gonna be
okay here on your own?

392
00:41:48,802 --> 00:41:49,872
Yeah.

393
00:41:50,212 --> 00:41:52,254
<i>Oh, okay, the family friend
of the freaky people...</i>

394
00:41:52,255 --> 00:41:54,350
<i>...who pretend a doll
is their dead son?</i>

395
00:41:54,376 --> 00:41:56,410
<i>Yeah, totally trust their judgment!</i>

396
00:41:56,412 --> 00:41:58,102
It’s not like that.
He didn’t have to come over...

397
00:41:58,103 --> 00:41:59,314
...here and check
the whole house.

398
00:41:59,340 --> 00:42:01,572
<i>No. You watch. You’ll wake up
in the middle of the night...</i>

399
00:42:01,573 --> 00:42:03,475
<i>...and he’ll be standing over
you in your coral dress...</i>

400
00:42:03,476 --> 00:42:05,337
<i>...with lipstick smeared
all over his face.</i>

401
00:42:05,438 --> 00:42:07,435
<i>I’m serious.</i>

402
00:42:07,746 --> 00:42:10,505
<i>Gosh! There are really bad
people out there in this world.</i>

403
00:42:10,530 --> 00:42:13,181
<i>Unfortunately, you should
know that better than most.</i>

404
00:42:14,311 --> 00:42:15,890
<i>Speaking of...</i>

405
00:42:16,015 --> 00:42:18,406
<i>Cole came by the house.</i>

406
00:42:18,608 --> 00:42:21,873
<i>Morgan said he just kept pounding
and pounding on the door.</i>

407
00:42:21,875 --> 00:42:23,868
<i>Cole told him some
story about wanted...</i>

408
00:42:23,869 --> 00:42:25,930
<i>...to write you a letter
apologizing for everything.</i>

409
00:42:25,956 --> 00:42:27,643
Please tell me Morgan didn’t
give him the address.

410
00:42:27,645 --> 00:42:29,357
<i>He didn’t know how else
to get rid of him.</i>

411
00:42:29,358 --> 00:42:30,657
<i>He is ten years old.</i>

412
00:42:30,941 --> 00:42:33,454
<i>- Sorry, Greta.</i>
- No, I know...

413
00:42:33,456 --> 00:42:35,936
I’m the one who should be sorry
for dragging you guys on to this.

414
00:42:35,938 --> 00:42:37,534
<i>Don’t say that. We are family.</i>

415
00:42:37,559 --> 00:42:39,397
<i>And you didn’t do
anything wrong.</i>

416
00:42:39,399 --> 00:42:44,477
<i>What happened back
then it was his fault.</i>

417
00:42:44,478 --> 00:42:47,007
No, I will not read anything
that son of a bitch sends me.

418
00:42:47,736 --> 00:42:49,934
<i>Greta, everything
happens for a reason.</i>

419
00:43:09,590 --> 00:43:10,937
Hello?

420
00:43:43,755 --> 00:43:45,355
Jesus!

421
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:52,332
Hello?

422
00:44:56,570 --> 00:44:58,956
- Hello?
<i>- Greta?</i>

423
00:45:10,322 --> 00:45:11,399
Yeah?

424
00:45:12,252 --> 00:45:13,670
Who is this?

425
00:45:13,885 --> 00:45:15,689
<i>Please come out.</i>

426
00:45:16,699 --> 00:45:19,287
<i>Come play with me, Greta.</i>

427
00:45:20,711 --> 00:45:22,011
<i>Greta?</i>

428
00:45:22,762 --> 00:45:24,087
Who is this?

429
00:45:24,412 --> 00:45:27,298
<i>Why won't you follow the rules?</i>

430
00:45:36,662 --> 00:45:38,393
What are you doing?

431
00:46:06,218 --> 00:46:08,821
<i>I promise I'll be good.</i>

432
00:46:10,762 --> 00:46:12,694
<i>If you be good.</i>

433
00:48:01,635 --> 00:48:03,374
Is this what you want?

434
00:48:09,199 --> 00:48:10,598
Okay.

435
00:48:17,320 --> 00:48:19,831
- Hello?
<i>- Greta, it's Malcolm.</i>

436
00:48:22,438 --> 00:48:24,155
It's the weirdest thing.

437
00:48:24,592 --> 00:48:26,606
When I first got here
Mrs. Heelshire said...

438
00:48:26,631 --> 00:48:28,644
...that Brahms took my shoes.

439
00:48:29,584 --> 00:48:31,302
And that he was playful.

440
00:48:32,369 --> 00:48:34,281
And I thought he was joking.

441
00:48:34,283 --> 00:48:38,021
Greta, are you okay?
What about shoes?

442
00:48:38,023 --> 00:48:39,898
No, it's not about my shoes.

443
00:48:41,140 --> 00:48:43,520
Greta, I'm not sure
I understand, but ...

444
00:48:43,522 --> 00:48:46,021
I have... I have to go.

445
00:48:46,545 --> 00:48:47,845
<i>Greta?</i>

446
00:49:10,192 --> 00:49:12,680
<i>It’s time, my dear.</i>

447
00:50:30,850 --> 00:50:32,582
Wakey wakey.

448
00:50:55,322 --> 00:50:57,706
<i>She is going by herself,
ask the Porters wife?</i>

449
00:50:57,708 --> 00:51:00,653
<i>Yes. And how far is it?
50 miles.</i>

450
00:51:00,655 --> 00:51:03,213
<i>What a long way! I wonder
Mrs. Reid is not afraid...</i>

451
00:51:03,214 --> 00:51:05,510
<i>...to trust you so far alone.</i>

452
00:51:11,675 --> 00:51:13,486
<i>I remember about
little of the journey.</i>

453
00:51:13,511 --> 00:51:16,601
<i>I only know that the
days seemed to me...</i>

454
00:51:29,146 --> 00:51:31,350
I think we did it all.

455
00:51:55,772 --> 00:51:57,988
I'll teach you this one.
Okay, Brahmsy?

456
00:52:00,104 --> 00:52:02,130
I didn't know you could play?

457
00:52:02,310 --> 00:52:04,605
Sorry. I tried the knocking.

458
00:52:05,282 --> 00:52:06,431
It's okay.

459
00:52:06,524 --> 00:52:09,218
- What are you doing here;
- You didn't pick up the phone.

460
00:52:09,594 --> 00:52:13,237
So I thought maybe I made the
delivery a little earlier this week.

461
00:52:13,239 --> 00:52:14,700
I can come back if you...

462
00:52:14,925 --> 00:52:17,261
No, that's okay.
I just wasn't expecting you.

463
00:52:18,670 --> 00:52:19,670
Right.

464
00:52:19,695 --> 00:52:22,367
I grab the mail on the way.

465
00:52:22,429 --> 00:52:23,973
Are you sure you're okay?

466
00:52:25,590 --> 00:52:26,655
Yeah.

467
00:52:27,265 --> 00:52:28,707
Put it in there.

468
00:52:35,598 --> 00:52:37,635
It looks like you and
Brahms are getting on.

469
00:52:39,793 --> 00:52:40,793
Yeah.

470
00:52:42,869 --> 00:52:47,763
I was thinking I might take you
up on that night-on-the-town.

471
00:52:47,765 --> 00:52:51,070
Dinner. Drinks. Dancing.
I’ll have you know I’m...

472
00:52:51,071 --> 00:52:53,825
...a legend in these parts
for my dance moves.

473
00:52:55,158 --> 00:52:56,703
I don’t think I should.

474
00:52:58,659 --> 00:52:59,915
Why not?

475
00:53:01,046 --> 00:53:03,626
You don’t worry about
Brahms, do you?

476
00:53:03,628 --> 00:53:06,710
He doesn’t mind, do you?
Hey, you old sod.

477
00:53:06,738 --> 00:53:10,120
Of course not. I’ve been hoping she’d
get out. I need a little privacy.

478
00:53:11,100 --> 00:53:15,568
Think I’ll watch telly. Have a
nice bath. A little Brahms time.

479
00:53:16,449 --> 00:53:19,089
Hey, here. High five.

480
00:53:23,267 --> 00:53:24,709
Maybe another time.

481
00:53:25,778 --> 00:53:27,310
Yeah, another time.

482
00:53:31,344 --> 00:53:32,663
I better be off.

483
00:54:03,406 --> 00:54:04,806
Brahms.

484
00:54:08,031 --> 00:54:09,571
Can you hear me?

485
00:54:17,430 --> 00:54:18,930
Brahms.

486
00:54:30,055 --> 00:54:31,815
Eat your food.

487
00:54:40,050 --> 00:54:43,583
If there is a spirit in this
house, please give me a sign.

488
00:55:03,895 --> 00:55:05,258
Stupid.

489
00:55:25,540 --> 00:55:27,774
I 'm so sorry to make you drive
all the way out here again.

490
00:55:27,775 --> 00:55:30,544
- Are you okay?
- I needed someone else to see it.

491
00:55:30,561 --> 00:55:32,666
- So I’d know.
- To see what?

492
00:55:32,868 --> 00:55:35,192
- He’s alive.
- Who’s alive?

493
00:55:35,219 --> 00:55:38,490
- Brahms is alive.
- Brahms is alive?

494
00:55:38,492 --> 00:55:40,567
I know you must think I’m crazy.

495
00:55:40,568 --> 00:55:42,463
I’d think the same thing.

496
00:55:42,489 --> 00:55:45,526
I just have to clean this off so
you know that I’m not cheating.

497
00:55:45,529 --> 00:55:47,953
I don’t think you’re cheating.
No worries there.

498
00:55:48,236 --> 00:55:50,317
I think you’ve gone
completely mental.

499
00:55:50,654 --> 00:55:52,453
We have to use the chalk.

500
00:55:54,011 --> 00:55:57,565
Because sometimes he doesn’t move
that much and it’s hard to tell.

501
00:55:57,644 --> 00:56:00,402
I was very scientific in the
beginning, I was even measuring him...

502
00:56:00,403 --> 00:56:03,209
...because I want to make sure that
when it happens there is no doubt.

503
00:56:03,957 --> 00:56:05,057
At all.

504
00:56:05,814 --> 00:56:07,542
Okay. Here we go.

505
00:56:09,518 --> 00:56:12,003
This is something. It’s...

506
00:56:12,628 --> 00:56:14,120
...something.

507
00:56:17,059 --> 00:56:19,416
I couldn’t figure it out before.

508
00:56:19,417 --> 00:56:23,007
All these strange things
kept happening, but...

509
00:56:23,734 --> 00:56:25,263
...little things, like...

510
00:56:25,783 --> 00:56:30,563
...the footsteps, my necklace, my
shoes, my clothes kept disappearing.

511
00:56:34,587 --> 00:56:36,408
Then remembered what you said.

512
00:56:36,428 --> 00:56:38,634
That he’s shy. He doesn’t
want people to see him. So,

513
00:56:39,054 --> 00:56:41,267
if you go out of the room
and you leave him alone,

514
00:56:42,343 --> 00:56:43,820
then he’ll give you sign.

515
00:56:43,840 --> 00:56:46,586
Okay, this is like some kind
of a magic trick, right?

516
00:56:46,587 --> 00:56:48,187
You don’t really
think he’s alive?

517
00:56:48,457 --> 00:56:50,280
It’s not a trick, come on.

518
00:56:55,183 --> 00:56:57,971
Okay, Brahms! Here we come!

519
00:56:59,949 --> 00:57:01,336
Okay. It’s okay.

520
00:57:01,756 --> 00:57:03,945
I think maybe we should
sit down for a bit.

521
00:57:03,946 --> 00:57:06,313
Honestly, I think maybe
you’re a bit tired.

522
00:57:07,502 --> 00:57:10,595
Please, Brahms. I need
him to see, okay?

523
00:57:11,086 --> 00:57:13,327
I know this is hard
for you but...

524
00:57:13,752 --> 00:57:15,292
...do it for me?

525
00:57:15,456 --> 00:57:17,448
I need this or I have to go.

526
00:57:17,873 --> 00:57:20,341
- I can’t stay here any more.
- Greta, come on.

527
00:57:20,522 --> 00:57:23,416
Brahms. Just give him
one more chance, okay?

528
00:57:23,919 --> 00:57:27,571
If he doesn’t move nothing
happens and I’m crazy.

529
00:57:29,864 --> 00:57:32,716
Just one more chance.
Okay, Brahmsy?

530
00:57:35,040 --> 00:57:36,340
Okay.

531
00:58:17,357 --> 00:58:19,516
- Where is he gone? Where? Come on.
- I don’t know.

532
00:58:19,517 --> 00:58:21,746
No, I don’t know. He does
it differently every time.

533
00:58:21,833 --> 00:58:24,994
He is just gone.
He is just gone.

534
00:58:28,547 --> 00:58:30,173
It’s never been there before.

535
00:58:30,948 --> 00:58:33,247
It’s bloody
incredible, isn’t it?

536
00:58:33,483 --> 00:58:35,579
We really don’t even know
what we’re dealing with here.

537
00:58:35,581 --> 00:58:37,851
Is it a ghost? Some sort
of trapped spirit. Or a...

538
00:58:37,952 --> 00:58:39,258
...a boy.

539
00:58:40,465 --> 00:58:43,829
- Brahms is a boy.
- Yeah. Yeah, he is.

540
00:58:45,995 --> 00:58:48,033
He was lucky you came along.

541
00:58:48,799 --> 00:58:50,617
I don’t think it was luck.

542
00:58:50,942 --> 00:58:52,281
It wasn’t?

543
00:58:52,716 --> 00:58:54,807
I think I was brought
here for a reason.

544
00:58:57,531 --> 00:58:58,731
Okay.

545
00:58:59,151 --> 00:59:02,026
There was a guy back home.

546
00:59:02,528 --> 00:59:03,778
Cole.

547
00:59:04,103 --> 00:59:05,330
Not a good guy.

548
00:59:06,456 --> 00:59:07,515
And...

549
00:59:09,793 --> 00:59:12,651
...everyone I knew
beg me to leave him.

550
00:59:14,288 --> 00:59:16,099
And then I found out
I was pregnant.

551
00:59:17,099 --> 00:59:18,342
And...

552
00:59:19,054 --> 00:59:21,285
...he swore up and down
that he would change.

553
00:59:22,800 --> 00:59:24,427
And that he was sorry.

554
00:59:25,990 --> 00:59:27,547
And I believed him.

555
00:59:31,153 --> 00:59:32,392
And...

556
00:59:34,400 --> 00:59:38,128
Then one day he went
off again and...

557
00:59:39,901 --> 00:59:42,416
...and my sister checked
me to the hospital.

558
00:59:42,765 --> 00:59:46,121
And I knew before I even got
there that I had lost the baby.

559
00:59:50,492 --> 00:59:52,429
What I am trying to
say is that......

560
00:59:54,117 --> 00:59:57,012
I know what it feels
like to lose a child.

561
00:59:57,521 --> 00:59:59,422
Just like the Heelshires and...

562
01:00:00,781 --> 01:00:02,616
...that ties me to them,

563
01:00:03,183 --> 01:00:05,195
and to Brahms, and...

564
01:00:06,575 --> 01:00:08,214
...and to this place.

565
01:00:11,922 --> 01:00:13,867
Does it make any sense to you?

566
01:00:15,547 --> 01:00:17,855
Yeah. Yeah, it does.

567
01:00:18,370 --> 01:00:21,741
But whatever the reason, I am very
happy that you ended up here.

568
01:00:23,879 --> 01:00:25,227
I am, too.

569
01:00:29,903 --> 01:00:33,192
<i>And God bless Malcolm.
And God bless me.</i>

570
01:00:33,773 --> 01:00:35,911
And God bless Brahmsy.

571
01:00:36,338 --> 01:00:38,638
You’re such a good boy today.

572
01:00:41,968 --> 01:00:43,516
Sweet dreams.

573
01:00:56,763 --> 01:00:58,315
So...

574
01:01:01,407 --> 01:01:05,042
<i>- It’s a nice shirt.
- My mother bought me this shirt.</i>

575
01:01:05,591 --> 01:01:09,028
<i>- She has good taste.</i>
- I know.

576
01:01:29,710 --> 01:01:32,122
- No, wait.
- Are you okay?

577
01:02:11,157 --> 01:02:13,073
What is going on in here?

578
01:02:14,811 --> 01:02:16,648
You gonna hurt your ears,

579
01:02:17,173 --> 01:02:18,995
silly boy.

580
01:02:20,379 --> 01:02:22,404
Why did you do that for?

581
01:02:44,478 --> 01:02:46,209
...if you stayed
in town tonight.

582
01:02:46,589 --> 01:02:48,926
Okay. What just happened?

583
01:02:50,032 --> 01:02:51,469
That music...

584
01:02:51,954 --> 01:02:53,256
That was...

585
01:02:54,912 --> 01:02:56,528
Children have tantrums.

586
01:02:56,853 --> 01:02:58,187
It was a tantrum.

587
01:02:58,598 --> 01:03:01,017
Alright, I understand
what this means to you.

588
01:03:01,291 --> 01:03:03,884
But just step back for a
second, get some perspective.

589
01:03:03,886 --> 01:03:05,248
No, I don’t need perspective.

590
01:03:05,627 --> 01:03:08,930
<i>I know exactly what is happening
here and I am not going anywhere.</i>

591
01:03:09,367 --> 01:03:11,407
<i>The Heelshires ask me
to look after him.</i>

592
01:03:11,408 --> 01:03:13,224
<i>I promised the Heelshires
to take care of him.</i>

593
01:03:13,250 --> 01:03:15,811
<i>Under the circumstances I
think they will understand.</i>

594
01:03:15,986 --> 01:03:18,485
They chose me. They
want me to stay here.

595
01:03:18,945 --> 01:03:20,200
With Brahms.

596
01:03:30,476 --> 01:03:32,299
I should have told
you this before,

597
01:03:33,736 --> 01:03:35,574
but I didn’t want
to scare you off.

598
01:03:36,811 --> 01:03:39,034
A little girl from town
used to come out here,

599
01:03:39,159 --> 01:03:41,121
once a week to play with Brahms.

600
01:03:41,546 --> 01:03:42,678
Emily Cribbs.

601
01:03:43,049 --> 01:03:46,312
And on his birthday she comes
out but never makes it home.

602
01:03:47,609 --> 01:03:50,212
They finally found her
body in the woods,

603
01:03:50,237 --> 01:03:52,273
her skull has been crushed.

604
01:03:52,353 --> 01:03:54,661
Police called the Heelshires to
let them know that Brahms...

605
01:03:54,662 --> 01:03:56,977
...need to be questioned,
by the time they arrived,

606
01:03:56,978 --> 01:03:59,356
the place was already
up in flames.

607
01:03:59,383 --> 01:04:02,715
<i>The Heelshires made it out but
Brahms has burned alive up there.</i>

608
01:04:02,901 --> 01:04:06,713
- Did they ever find her killer?
- No, they never did.

609
01:04:07,023 --> 01:04:08,752
What I’m saying is, if
you’re right, if this...

610
01:04:08,753 --> 01:04:10,835
...thing is some kind of
spirit or ghost or...

611
01:04:11,363 --> 01:04:13,234
...hey, I don’t even know.

612
01:04:14,349 --> 01:04:16,155
I’m not sure....

613
01:04:16,680 --> 01:04:19,086
...that it is the good kind.

614
01:04:20,005 --> 01:04:22,402
Well, you said it yourself
that’s just pub talk.

615
01:04:22,604 --> 01:04:24,641
But what if it isn’t?

616
01:04:27,292 --> 01:04:29,508
I know he wouldn’t hurt me.
I know.

617
01:04:29,533 --> 01:04:31,748
It’s not safe in
this house, okay?

618
01:04:36,893 --> 01:04:38,534
I am not leaving.

619
01:04:41,975 --> 01:04:43,375
Okay.

620
01:04:45,200 --> 01:04:47,996
Now go straight to sleep
like a good boy, okey?

621
01:04:53,222 --> 01:04:55,324
You wouldn’t hurt me,
would you Brahms?

622
01:05:49,731 --> 01:05:51,587
<i>Emily Cribbs.</i>

623
01:06:30,412 --> 01:06:32,071
Who is hungry?

624
01:06:35,539 --> 01:06:36,814
I am.

625
01:06:43,038 --> 01:06:44,338
Malcolm?

626
01:06:48,870 --> 01:06:50,726
Let’s go to see.

627
01:06:53,500 --> 01:06:54,800
Malcolm?

628
01:06:55,125 --> 01:06:56,430
I thought...

629
01:07:02,536 --> 01:07:03,936
Cole?

630
01:07:04,861 --> 01:07:06,320
Who is Malcolm?

631
01:07:08,145 --> 01:07:10,316
I was going to write
you a letter, but,

632
01:07:10,741 --> 01:07:12,103
you know me.

633
01:07:12,634 --> 01:07:14,476
Never been one for writing.

634
01:07:15,050 --> 01:07:16,590
It’s the little fellow?

635
01:07:17,361 --> 01:07:18,912
What’s his name?

636
01:07:20,007 --> 01:07:21,368
Brahms.

637
01:07:28,931 --> 01:07:31,235
This is a joke, right?

638
01:07:34,662 --> 01:07:36,712
There isn’t a little boy.
They...

639
01:07:37,483 --> 01:07:39,664
They paid me to
look after a doll.

640
01:07:43,709 --> 01:07:45,176
You serious?

641
01:07:45,635 --> 01:07:48,631
Well, that makes things a
hell of a lot simpler.

642
01:07:49,041 --> 01:07:52,244
Whole way here I was trying to figure
out how I was going to convince you...

643
01:07:52,245 --> 01:07:55,759
...to come home and how we deal
with the boy, but now this shit.

644
01:07:59,390 --> 01:08:01,772
I’ve been working out
at Fairview with...

645
01:08:02,044 --> 01:08:03,414
...Ed Bruner’s crew.

646
01:08:03,738 --> 01:08:06,638
They got a contract on a...
on a new hotel.

647
01:08:07,216 --> 01:08:09,760
So there’s more enough
work for all of us.

648
01:08:10,651 --> 01:08:11,786
Well,

649
01:08:12,458 --> 01:08:14,638
that’s awesome, Cole.
Is what you wanted.

650
01:08:20,937 --> 01:08:22,357
I understand why you left.

651
01:08:22,682 --> 01:08:23,754
I do.

652
01:08:32,413 --> 01:08:34,253
Our flight leaves
tomorrow afternoon.

653
01:08:36,323 --> 01:08:38,887
- Taking you home.
<i>- Greta?</i>

654
01:08:41,884 --> 01:08:43,005
Oh sorry, I...

655
01:08:43,430 --> 01:08:45,589
- I let myself in.
- That’s okay, this is...

656
01:08:46,091 --> 01:08:47,437
- This is Malcolm. He brings our...
- Malcolm.

657
01:08:47,438 --> 01:08:49,055
...groceries and stuff out here.

658
01:08:49,056 --> 01:08:50,968
- Hey, nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you man.

659
01:08:52,471 --> 01:08:54,234
So what do you think
about all this...

660
01:08:54,659 --> 01:08:56,022
...doll stuff?

661
01:08:56,123 --> 01:08:59,397
You know, I try not to get involved
in other people’s business.

662
01:09:02,219 --> 01:09:03,377
Smart man.

663
01:09:04,248 --> 01:09:06,919
I have that delivery if you’d
like to go to the inventory list.

664
01:09:06,925 --> 01:09:07,963
Yeah, sure.

665
01:09:08,288 --> 01:09:09,370
I'll be right back.

666
01:09:21,601 --> 01:09:24,302
- What the hell is he doing here?
- He just showed up.

667
01:09:24,704 --> 01:09:27,412
Well, he has to leave. He can’t
ask you let him stay here.

668
01:09:27,413 --> 01:09:29,404
No, I don’t. I am not
letting him do anything.

669
01:09:30,080 --> 01:09:31,841
He wants me to go home with him.

670
01:09:31,866 --> 01:09:33,726
Well, that isn’t gonna happen.

671
01:09:37,590 --> 01:09:40,143
- And what if he attacks you?
- He won't.

672
01:09:40,668 --> 01:09:42,576
Trust me.

673
01:09:43,676 --> 01:09:45,130
I have a plan.

674
01:09:46,975 --> 01:09:48,618
Sounds good though.

675
01:09:50,742 --> 01:09:52,224
Pleasure meeting you.

676
01:09:52,549 --> 01:09:55,171
- You too.
- Yeah, have a good evening.

677
01:10:04,881 --> 01:10:06,402
Should I be worried?

678
01:10:06,727 --> 01:10:07,763
About Malcolm?

679
01:10:08,188 --> 01:10:09,239
No.

680
01:10:39,182 --> 01:10:40,639
Here you go.

681
01:10:41,394 --> 01:10:43,693
So I guess I am not sleeping
in your bed tonight.

682
01:10:43,795 --> 01:10:46,616
- No, I can bring you more blankets.
- No, this is good.

683
01:10:48,611 --> 01:10:50,075
What are you doing
with that thing?

684
01:10:50,077 --> 01:10:52,532
Well, I was gonna get him out of your 
way. I figured you wouldn’t want...

685
01:10:53,033 --> 01:10:54,790
...him to sitting
in here with you.

686
01:10:55,116 --> 01:10:57,122
- He is a creepy little guy.
- Yeah.

687
01:10:57,546 --> 01:10:59,846
Look, Greta.

688
01:11:00,761 --> 01:11:02,498
I’m sorry for what happened.

689
01:11:03,962 --> 01:11:05,676
I just need to know,

690
01:11:06,301 --> 01:11:07,714
that you forgive me.

691
01:11:08,042 --> 01:11:10,208
- I like to hear you say that.
- I can’t.

692
01:11:10,332 --> 01:11:11,432
Greta.

693
01:11:15,017 --> 01:11:17,733
Fine. But I want you to
realize something right now.

694
01:11:20,035 --> 01:11:21,881
You are not leaving me, Greta.

695
01:11:22,824 --> 01:11:26,656
And I will not let you go.
No matter where you run off to.

696
01:11:32,182 --> 01:11:33,646
You understand?

697
01:11:42,125 --> 01:11:43,325
Now...

698
01:11:45,550 --> 01:11:47,850
Make sure you’re packed
and ready by morning.

699
01:12:10,185 --> 01:12:13,187
Don’t worry, Brahms. 
I am not gonna leave you.

700
01:12:20,152 --> 01:12:21,894
But I need your help.

701
01:13:33,642 --> 01:13:34,742
Greta!

702
01:13:38,466 --> 01:13:39,766
Greta!

703
01:13:41,567 --> 01:13:43,110
Get in here!

704
01:13:50,400 --> 01:13:51,700
Greta!

705
01:13:55,325 --> 01:13:57,521
- Cole, what happened?
- Get in here.

706
01:13:57,846 --> 01:13:59,833
Right now. What is this?

707
01:14:00,585 --> 01:14:02,694
- Was this you?
- I didn’t do that.

708
01:14:02,696 --> 01:14:05,474
Don’t play these games at me!
How can that not be you?

709
01:14:05,652 --> 01:14:07,723
- No one else is in this house.
- Brahms.

710
01:14:14,343 --> 01:14:15,774
The doll?

711
01:14:17,514 --> 01:14:19,224
The doll wrote this?

712
01:14:19,513 --> 01:14:21,708
Don’t pull this
shit on me, Greta.

713
01:14:22,387 --> 01:14:23,646
Okay. Fine.

714
01:14:24,298 --> 01:14:25,776
It wasn’t you.

715
01:14:26,335 --> 01:14:27,770
It was the doll.

716
01:14:29,744 --> 01:14:30,910
Give it to me.

717
01:14:32,144 --> 01:14:33,357
- Give me the doll.
- No.

718
01:14:33,359 --> 01:14:35,563
Give me the doll. Greta?

719
01:14:35,811 --> 01:14:39,968
- Hand him over.
<i>- No, no, get off of me.</i>

720
01:14:41,270 --> 01:14:43,850
- It was me. You’re right, it was me.
- It’s too late.

721
01:14:43,952 --> 01:14:45,487
- Now, give me the doll.
- No.

722
01:14:45,570 --> 01:14:47,548
<i>- Greta?</i>
- Now! I’m not joking around!

723
01:14:48,348 --> 01:14:50,435
Get your things and
get out of here.

724
01:14:50,936 --> 01:14:54,160
You know, everyone just seems to
be in a big hurry for me to leave.

725
01:14:54,162 --> 01:14:55,439
- You’re right?
- Yeah.

726
01:14:55,441 --> 01:14:58,456
Maybe... Maybe you left
that little message for me.

727
01:14:59,394 --> 01:15:01,211
Or are you gonna say
it was the doll too?

728
01:15:01,212 --> 01:15:02,928
- What did Brahms do?
- Cole,

729
01:15:03,117 --> 01:15:05,139
you don’t understand what’s happening.
The doll...

730
01:15:05,141 --> 01:15:07,550
No. I think I understand
exactly what’s going on.

731
01:15:07,552 --> 01:15:08,320
Give me the doll!

732
01:15:08,321 --> 01:15:09,864
- What’s so special about this doll?
- Cole!

733
01:15:10,329 --> 01:15:11,499
Cole, please.

734
01:15:11,824 --> 01:15:12,906
No!

735
01:15:13,430 --> 01:15:14,591
Cole!

736
01:15:15,091 --> 01:15:16,162
Fine.

737
01:15:40,384 --> 01:15:41,826
What the hell was that?

738
01:15:44,726 --> 01:15:46,247
I think we need to leave.

739
01:15:46,549 --> 01:15:48,191
What’s... What’s going on?

740
01:16:05,264 --> 01:16:07,115
We should... We should really go.

741
01:16:16,649 --> 01:16:18,002
There is something...

742
01:16:22,882 --> 01:16:24,245
- Oh shit.
- Oh my God!

743
01:16:24,269 --> 01:16:25,669
<i>Greta?</i>

744
01:16:29,493 --> 01:16:30,893
<i>Greta?</i>

745
01:16:35,789 --> 01:16:37,227
Get up. Come on.

746
01:16:39,343 --> 01:16:40,777
Jesus, what is that?

747
01:16:50,655 --> 01:16:52,213
It’s Brahms.

748
01:16:52,925 --> 01:16:54,286
He can’t be.

749
01:16:59,010 --> 01:17:01,210
- No!
- No!

750
01:17:09,933 --> 01:17:11,782
Stop! Stop!

751
01:17:20,406 --> 01:17:21,606
No!

752
01:17:32,630 --> 01:17:34,130
Oh my God!

753
01:17:44,637 --> 01:17:45,872
Let’s go.

754
01:17:49,296 --> 01:17:50,396
No!

755
01:18:04,828 --> 01:18:06,074
It’s dead.

756
01:18:28,936 --> 01:18:30,290
The closet!

757
01:18:52,824 --> 01:18:54,074
This way.

758
01:18:54,499 --> 01:18:55,769
The key.

759
01:18:56,379 --> 01:18:57,627
The key. Find the key.

760
01:18:57,647 --> 01:18:59,908
I can’t see anything. Oh my God!

761
01:19:00,476 --> 01:19:03,156
Malcolm, we can
get out this way.

762
01:19:04,581 --> 01:19:05,709
Let’s go.

763
01:19:11,467 --> 01:19:12,881
Close it.

764
01:19:14,890 --> 01:19:16,742
- Come on.
- It only goes up.

765
01:19:30,934 --> 01:19:32,800
- Which way?
- Dead end.

766
01:19:34,463 --> 01:19:35,726
Malcolm!

767
01:19:40,099 --> 01:19:41,299
Jesus Christ!

768
01:19:41,424 --> 01:19:43,459
- Oh my God, what is this?
- He’s got everything he could need.

769
01:19:43,460 --> 01:19:45,247
He’s been leaving
in here, isn’t it?

770
01:19:45,806 --> 01:19:47,513
We got to find a way out.

771
01:19:52,922 --> 01:19:54,534
It’s me.

772
01:19:55,389 --> 01:19:58,906
That’s my dress. 
My necklace and my hair.

773
01:19:59,274 --> 01:20:01,156
Greta, I found a way down.

774
01:20:03,508 --> 01:20:06,110
He’s been watching
me this whole time.

775
01:20:14,487 --> 01:20:16,379
Okay, come on.
This way, come on.

776
01:20:16,399 --> 01:20:18,766
<i>We will not be back.
The girl is yours now.</i>

777
01:20:18,767 --> 01:20:20,478
<i>She is yours to love and...</i>

778
01:20:21,187 --> 01:20:22,960
- They will never coming back
- Come on, Greta. Come on.

779
01:20:22,961 --> 01:20:26,300
He’s been living in the walls
the whole time watching me.

780
01:20:26,424 --> 01:20:28,124
Get in. Get in.

781
01:21:22,969 --> 01:21:23,989
Come on.

782
01:21:29,353 --> 01:21:33,271
- Out. Out. Go.
- It’s the outside.

783
01:21:35,214 --> 01:21:38,189
- It’s locked.
- Come on, Greta. Open it.

784
01:21:41,972 --> 01:21:43,972
- Malcolm, where are you going?
- He is coming.

785
01:21:44,276 --> 01:21:47,237
- I am not leaving without you!
- Just go! I don’t want you to die!

786
01:21:47,238 --> 01:21:48,967
- No!
- Go!

787
01:21:49,944 --> 01:21:51,982
Come on. Come on.

788
01:22:08,688 --> 01:22:09,888
No!

789
01:22:16,212 --> 01:22:18,012
<i>Greta?</i>

790
01:22:19,013 --> 01:22:20,669
<i>Come back!</i>

791
01:22:22,668 --> 01:22:25,387
<i>I’ ll be good! I will!</i>

792
01:22:26,511 --> 01:22:28,211
<i>- Greta.</i>
- No!

793
01:22:28,237 --> 01:22:29,876
<i>Get back here!</i>

794
01:22:32,066 --> 01:22:33,772
<i>Get back here!</i>

795
01:22:34,506 --> 01:22:39,007
<i>Don’t leave me! Get back here!</i>

796
01:22:39,272 --> 01:22:43,736
<i>If you leave I’ll kill him! I’ll
kill him just like the others!</i>

797
01:23:00,260 --> 01:23:01,460
No.

798
01:23:02,484 --> 01:23:03,884
Malcolm!

799
01:23:47,279 --> 01:23:49,200
I came back for you Brahms.

800
01:23:54,057 --> 01:23:56,852
I told you I wouldn’t leave
you and I didn’t, did I?

801
01:24:01,298 --> 01:24:03,049
I told you I wouldn’t.

802
01:24:09,244 --> 01:24:10,644
Brahms!

803
01:24:12,069 --> 01:24:13,612
It’s time for bed now.

804
01:24:16,509 --> 01:24:18,614
Brahms I said it’s time for bed.

805
01:24:19,157 --> 01:24:20,793
Let’s go.

806
01:24:23,968 --> 01:24:25,680
You know the rules.

807
01:24:42,019 --> 01:24:43,953
Put that down now Brahms.

808
01:24:52,511 --> 01:24:54,516
Are you ready for bed?

809
01:24:59,434 --> 01:25:01,258
Under the covers.

810
01:25:10,698 --> 01:25:13,661
Be a good boy Brahms and go
straight to sleep, okay?

811
01:25:18,143 --> 01:25:19,588
<i>Kiss.</i>

812
01:25:20,918 --> 01:25:23,031
No kiss tonight Brahms.

813
01:25:23,770 --> 01:25:25,997
It’s your punishment, I’m sorry.

814
01:25:32,675 --> 01:25:34,021
<i>Kiss.</i>

815
01:26:56,545 --> 01:26:57,845
Malcolm!

816
01:26:59,669 --> 01:27:00,969
Malcolm!

817
01:27:02,893 --> 01:27:04,193
Malcolm!

818
01:27:04,400 --> 01:27:24,400
