1
00:03:15,595 --> 00:03:16,892
Attention.

2
00:03:20,833 --> 00:03:23,461
At ease, gentlemen. Be seated, please.

3
00:03:27,607 --> 00:03:30,633
As you've all probably noticed,
we're currently headed north.

4
00:03:30,743 --> 00:03:35,043
Tomorrow morning at 0500 hours, we will
be taking a position at Yankee Station.

5
00:03:36,716 --> 00:03:38,308
That means we're back in business.

6
00:03:38,418 --> 00:03:42,218
We'll be flying sorties over North Vietnam
to take out enemy supply lines,

7
00:03:42,322 --> 00:03:45,485
which means we have to cross over
into Laos.

8
00:03:47,126 --> 00:03:49,185
This mission is classified.

9
00:03:49,762 --> 00:03:54,461
No cards and letters to sweethearts.
No phone calls to family back home.

10
00:03:54,567 --> 00:03:57,468
- Is that understood?
Yes, sir.

11
00:03:57,570 --> 00:03:59,299
No one can know.

12
00:03:59,405 --> 00:04:02,135
No one except Charlie
when we kick his ass.

13
00:04:03,443 --> 00:04:05,934
<i>For survival
in the jungle environment,</i>

14
00:04:06,045 --> 00:04:11,347
<i>the smart soldier must understand
that nature is not a force against him.</i>

15
00:04:11,451 --> 00:04:13,942
<i>He has to make nature work for him</i>

16
00:04:14,053 --> 00:04:18,456
<i>by utilizing the ample natural provisions
at his disposal.</i>

17
00:04:18,558 --> 00:04:20,526
Is this a double feature?

18
00:04:21,728 --> 00:04:25,357
For God's sake, just lean your head back
and open your mouth.

19
00:04:25,465 --> 00:04:26,898
What is this?

20
00:04:28,167 --> 00:04:31,136
Hell, the boys back home
don't know anything about the jungle.

21
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:34,069
<i>In the jungle,
your best friend is your knife.</i>

22
00:04:34,173 --> 00:04:36,869
Oh, look at...
Now he's getting serious.

23
00:04:38,177 --> 00:04:42,341
Cut the leaf, man. Here it goes.
Come on, baby, cut. Cut.

24
00:04:45,551 --> 00:04:48,179
Where is the salt and pepper shaker
for that leaf?

25
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:50,222
Chew it, boy! Chew it!

26
00:04:51,457 --> 00:04:54,654
Leaf good. Me like leaf.

27
00:04:56,262 --> 00:04:58,253
<i>Maintain a constant state
of readiness...</i>

28
00:04:58,364 --> 00:05:01,231
What did he do, sit in an anthill?
Look at him.

29
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:07,198
<i>And then, when
the rescue helicopter appears, make sure...</i>

30
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:10,276
Honestly,
it's right above your head!

31
00:05:11,144 --> 00:05:14,113
Jeez. Shake it, Pops.

32
00:05:15,615 --> 00:05:18,584
He's got a nice ass for a sailor,
I'll tell you that.

33
00:05:20,687 --> 00:05:23,087
I don't mean that in a weird way.

34
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:25,980
God bless America.

35
00:05:26,092 --> 00:05:28,686
<i>Are you a smart soldier?</i>

36
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:33,459
I mean, I just thought we'd be assisting
some South Vietnamese generals

37
00:05:33,566 --> 00:05:36,535
against a few infiltrators. Whole thing
would be done in three, four weeks.

38
00:05:36,636 --> 00:05:37,603
You picked the wrong time

39
00:05:37,704 --> 00:05:38,671
- to enlist, Dengler.
- I know.

40
00:05:38,805 --> 00:05:40,568
No, but I just wanted to fly so badly,

41
00:05:40,673 --> 00:05:45,076
and everybody, they were telling me
all about the fantastic massage parlors

42
00:05:45,178 --> 00:05:47,237
and the go-go girls, everything, and...

43
00:05:47,347 --> 00:05:49,781
And what did I get? Goddamn one night?

44
00:05:49,882 --> 00:05:52,680
- One night in Saigon. That's me.
- Yeah, and that didn't go so well.

45
00:05:52,785 --> 00:05:54,616
Gentlemen, next please.

46
00:05:56,489 --> 00:05:57,581
Okay.

47
00:05:58,124 --> 00:06:00,058
Hey, are there any mosquito nets?

48
00:06:00,159 --> 00:06:01,626
What you see is what you get.

49
00:06:01,728 --> 00:06:04,595
- Okay. Okay. I see plastic.
- Yes, sir.

50
00:06:04,697 --> 00:06:07,291
I see plastic there and how about...

51
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:10,699
Are you able to give me two slices
of that plastic, please?

52
00:06:10,803 --> 00:06:12,896
- Sir?
- And maybe six foot by three foot,

53
00:06:13,005 --> 00:06:14,131
you put a zipper in the middle,

54
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:15,264
- and I crawl inside...
- What you're describing

55
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:16,364
is a sauna, not a mosquito net.

56
00:06:16,476 --> 00:06:18,000
Not a mosquito net,
but it holds off the bugs.

57
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:20,443
And you put some netting on it
so I can breathe through at night time.

58
00:06:20,546 --> 00:06:21,672
- You got it, sir.
- Yes?

59
00:06:21,781 --> 00:06:23,271
- Absolutely, sir.
- Okay.

60
00:06:23,383 --> 00:06:26,682
Now, look here. Look at this.
I have my boot on your table.

61
00:06:26,786 --> 00:06:29,482
- Why do I have my boot on your table?
- I don't know, sir.

62
00:06:29,589 --> 00:06:31,921
Okay, this is why. Look at this.

63
00:06:32,792 --> 00:06:36,284
Can you create a flap for me
in the tongue here

64
00:06:36,396 --> 00:06:39,729
so I could hide my American passport
inside of here should I need it?

65
00:06:39,832 --> 00:06:43,393
You know what, sir? Since you're my only
customer today, it would be my pleasure.

66
00:06:43,503 --> 00:06:44,834
Thank you.

67
00:06:46,706 --> 00:06:49,504
So, Charlie got his shit together.

68
00:06:49,609 --> 00:06:53,511
Now we have heavy antiaircraft fire
around Mugia Pass.

69
00:06:53,613 --> 00:06:57,276
Change direction and altitude
every seven seconds

70
00:06:57,383 --> 00:07:00,944
so the radar of the enemy gun
cannot lock onto you.

71
00:07:01,053 --> 00:07:05,922
Your secondary target will be
the intersection of 121 and 90.

72
00:07:06,025 --> 00:07:07,049
That's the Ho Chi Minh Trail.

73
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:09,560
That's right, Spook, inside Laos.

74
00:07:09,662 --> 00:07:11,129
Now, one more thing.

75
00:07:11,230 --> 00:07:16,065
They've been using your radios
to lure our rescue teams into ambush.

76
00:07:16,669 --> 00:07:20,036
Now, don't get me wrong.
You go down, you use that radio.

77
00:07:20,139 --> 00:07:22,903
But if they're hot on your trail,
you scrap it.

78
00:07:23,009 --> 00:07:26,172
You scrap anything
that they can use against you.

79
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:31,280
Now, this is Flight Lieutenant Dengler's
first mission.

80
00:07:31,384 --> 00:07:32,646
Yes, sir.

81
00:07:34,353 --> 00:07:36,753
You're gonna be Spook's
wingman. You think you can handle that?

82
00:07:36,856 --> 00:07:39,552
I could not ask for a better man, sir.
But, please,

83
00:07:39,659 --> 00:07:41,786
- could I ask you a question, sir?
Go ahead.

84
00:07:41,894 --> 00:07:44,055
You know, Spook is such
a goddamn daredevil,

85
00:07:44,163 --> 00:07:48,725
could you please order him not to
try too hard to die for his country,

86
00:07:48,835 --> 00:07:53,238
but rather to let the son-of-a-bitch
on the other side die for his instead?

87
00:07:54,073 --> 00:07:55,938
Okay. All right, boys.

88
00:07:56,843 --> 00:07:58,470
- You all set?
Yes, sir.

89
00:07:58,578 --> 00:07:59,602
Anything else?

90
00:07:59,712 --> 00:08:00,906
No, sir.
- Okay. Let's go, go, go!

91
00:08:02,782 --> 00:08:07,617
<i>Radar Kilo, 6195, position four.</i>

92
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:12,887
<i>Radar Yankee, 67279,
position two.</i>

93
00:08:13,426 --> 00:08:15,621
- Heads against the wall. Come on.
- Come on, Diet.

94
00:08:15,728 --> 00:08:17,525
Come here.
This is what we would do as kids

95
00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:19,928
when we were out for mischief.
It would keep us out of trouble.

96
00:08:20,032 --> 00:08:22,227
But we would usually pee right now.

97
00:08:22,335 --> 00:08:24,166
- Can we pee?
- I don't really have to.

98
00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:25,601
I'm not gonna.

99
00:08:25,938 --> 00:08:28,736
But this will keep us safe. Okay, fellas?

100
00:08:29,308 --> 00:08:31,970
Stay out of trouble.
Come back in one piece. Good luck.

101
00:08:32,078 --> 00:08:34,069
- Come back, boys.
- You, too.

102
00:09:13,352 --> 00:09:16,844
<i>Boys, get set to change
the altitude again. On my mark.</i>

103
00:09:16,956 --> 00:09:18,719
<i>- Now.
- Roger.</i>

104
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:23,886
<i>Gentlemen, do you notice
the coastline down there?</i>

105
00:09:24,864 --> 00:09:26,832
<i>Welcome to North Vietnam.</i>

106
00:09:29,135 --> 00:09:30,830
It's pretty boring.

107
00:09:33,673 --> 00:09:35,538
<i>Boys, we got too much
cloud cover.</i>

108
00:09:35,641 --> 00:09:38,769
<i>Climbing again 280 west.
We're heading into Laos.</i>

109
00:09:43,115 --> 00:09:44,673
<i>Target in sight.</i>

110
00:09:46,218 --> 00:09:47,913
<i>Lessard, roll in.</i>

111
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:49,248
<i>Rolling.</i>

112
00:09:56,729 --> 00:09:58,321
<i>Farkas, roll in.</i>

113
00:09:58,798 --> 00:09:59,992
<i>Rolling.</i>

114
00:10:04,904 --> 00:10:06,496
<i>Dengler, roll in.</i>

115
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:07,971
Rolling in.

116
00:10:25,224 --> 00:10:28,625
I'm hit. I'm hit!

117
00:10:30,229 --> 00:10:33,130
<i>Dieter, you're losing altitude!
Pull it up!</i>

118
00:10:34,266 --> 00:10:35,824
<i>Dieter, pull up!</i>

119
00:10:43,175 --> 00:10:45,166
<i>Dengler, get out of there!</i>

120
00:10:46,278 --> 00:10:47,905
<i>Dieter, bail out!</i>

121
00:10:49,448 --> 00:10:51,609
<i>Dieter, bail out!</i>

122
00:10:52,184 --> 00:10:54,379
I'm not gonna bail out!

123
00:10:54,687 --> 00:10:56,587
I'm not gonna bail out!

124
00:16:38,063 --> 00:16:39,462
Oh, come on.

125
00:16:41,834 --> 00:16:43,062
Come on.

126
00:16:48,107 --> 00:16:50,234
Come on, search planes.

127
00:16:50,776 --> 00:16:54,075
Where are you? Where have you gone?

128
00:17:02,788 --> 00:17:03,982
Come on.

129
00:17:11,797 --> 00:17:14,197
God, how can it get this hot?

130
00:19:30,736 --> 00:19:34,695
Hey. Hey.
I need to go to the bathroom.

131
00:19:35,707 --> 00:19:36,935
I need...

132
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:40,671
I need to go to the bathroom.

133
00:19:42,314 --> 00:19:44,976
Yeah. I need to take a shit.

134
00:19:49,154 --> 00:19:51,247
Hey. Hey.

135
00:19:52,591 --> 00:19:54,456
I need to take a shit.

136
00:20:06,605 --> 00:20:07,936
Oh, shit.

137
00:20:09,074 --> 00:20:10,666
Hey. Hey.

138
00:20:13,178 --> 00:20:15,169
Does nobody listen to me?

139
00:20:18,850 --> 00:20:21,546
Why doesn't anybody listen around here?

140
00:20:22,688 --> 00:20:23,677
Why don't you listen to me?

141
00:20:23,789 --> 00:20:27,452
I said I needed the bathroom
and now I've shit myself.

142
00:20:27,559 --> 00:20:30,494
Why doesn't anybody listen around here?

143
00:20:30,596 --> 00:20:32,325
I've shit my pants.

144
00:22:07,793 --> 00:22:11,490
They can't hear us.
They can't see us through the treetops.

145
00:22:13,665 --> 00:22:16,395
It's not my fault. I didn't signal them.

146
00:22:28,413 --> 00:22:31,041
Don't ever, ever do that again!

147
00:22:31,149 --> 00:22:35,210
You better just shoot me right away!
Don't you ever do that again!

148
00:25:14,613 --> 00:25:16,012
This is unusual.

149
00:25:16,114 --> 00:25:19,982
You American pilots normally attack us
earlier in the day. Sit.

150
00:25:25,290 --> 00:25:26,621
No English.

151
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:29,386
German.

152
00:25:38,036 --> 00:25:40,800
Why don't you admit
that you are an American?

153
00:25:50,282 --> 00:25:51,271
Yes.

154
00:25:53,084 --> 00:25:55,052
I am an American citizen,

155
00:25:56,021 --> 00:25:57,886
and I love my country.

156
00:25:59,257 --> 00:26:01,452
But why are you in this war against us?

157
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:03,858
I never wanted to go to war.
I never wanted to go to...

158
00:26:03,962 --> 00:26:08,126
I saw enough as a child.
I only wanted to fly.

159
00:26:12,537 --> 00:26:14,562
Then you should sign this.

160
00:26:15,340 --> 00:26:17,001
"Condemning the imperialistic aggression

161
00:26:17,108 --> 00:26:20,976
"of the corrupt and debased political
establishment of the United States..."

162
00:26:21,079 --> 00:26:22,603
What else would you call it?

163
00:26:22,714 --> 00:26:25,308
"...against innocent children
and the peace loving working classes."

164
00:26:25,417 --> 00:26:28,215
No, I cannot sign this. I cannot sign it.

165
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:31,221
If you sign this, we would be your friends.

166
00:26:32,157 --> 00:26:35,888
- You could be released in two weeks if...
- I cannot sign this.

167
00:26:37,228 --> 00:26:39,196
- It's against my...
- Your what?

168
00:26:39,297 --> 00:26:41,822
I mean, what is in here?

169
00:26:42,267 --> 00:26:43,632
What isn't here?

170
00:26:43,735 --> 00:26:48,229
I love America. America gave me wings.
I will not sign it, absolutely not.

171
00:26:49,474 --> 00:26:50,668
No way.

172
00:26:54,079 --> 00:26:55,444
Your choice.

173
00:30:13,011 --> 00:30:15,707
The quick have their sleepwalkers,

174
00:30:17,949 --> 00:30:19,746
and so do the dead.

175
00:32:15,233 --> 00:32:16,325
Hey.

176
00:32:16,434 --> 00:32:19,562
- Hey. Hey.
Hey, there. Who's that? Hello.

177
00:32:19,671 --> 00:32:21,070
Hey, you American?

178
00:32:21,172 --> 00:32:22,867
- What?
He's American.

179
00:32:24,075 --> 00:32:27,567
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

180
00:32:27,679 --> 00:32:29,374
Yeah, I'm American.

181
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:35,248
My name is Dieter. I'm a U.S. Navy pilot.
And originally I was born in Germany...

182
00:32:35,353 --> 00:32:37,446
Be quiet.
...but I am a U.S. citizen now.

183
00:32:37,555 --> 00:32:39,147
Quiet.
- What?

184
00:32:39,257 --> 00:32:40,747
- Who's that?
Quiet.

185
00:32:40,858 --> 00:32:42,883
Why? I'm whispering.

186
00:32:42,994 --> 00:32:45,462
- Little Hitler's coming.
- Who?

187
00:32:45,563 --> 00:32:47,656
- Little Hitler.
- Who's that?

188
00:32:49,734 --> 00:32:51,429
Who's Little Hitler?

189
00:33:06,284 --> 00:33:07,342
Okay.

190
00:33:20,298 --> 00:33:23,199
Now, what the hell is this?
The Middle Ages?

191
00:33:27,171 --> 00:33:32,268
Hey, listen. Don't mess with
these guys. You'll regret it.

192
00:33:47,325 --> 00:33:51,091
- Hi. Dieter Dengler.
- All right, let's go. Give it over.

193
00:33:51,796 --> 00:33:53,423
Who won the World Series?

194
00:33:53,531 --> 00:33:54,998
- The World Series?
- Yeah.

195
00:33:55,099 --> 00:33:57,033
- I don't know...
- Hey, man, the guy don't like baseball?

196
00:33:57,135 --> 00:33:58,159
You don't like baseball?

197
00:33:58,269 --> 00:34:01,397
- No, I don't know. I don't follow baseball.
- I'm Yik Chiu Tuo.

198
00:34:01,506 --> 00:34:02,666
- Yik Chiu Tuo?
- They call me Y.C.

199
00:34:02,774 --> 00:34:04,503
- Okay, Y.C.
- Y.C.

200
00:34:04,609 --> 00:34:05,837
Hi, I'm Dieter Dengler.

201
00:34:05,943 --> 00:34:07,774
- Dieter Dengler.
- Yeah.

202
00:34:08,746 --> 00:34:10,873
We all flew together for Air America.

203
00:34:10,982 --> 00:34:15,419
Yeah, I'm world champion of bad luck.
But I tell you something, I'm undefeatable.

204
00:34:17,989 --> 00:34:19,047
Hi. Phisit.

205
00:34:19,157 --> 00:34:20,419
- Phisit.
- My name is Phisit.

206
00:34:20,525 --> 00:34:22,516
- Dieter. Dieter.
- Yeah.

207
00:34:22,627 --> 00:34:24,390
Procet Kam Phong Kit.

208
00:34:24,495 --> 00:34:25,826
- What?
- Procet.

209
00:34:25,930 --> 00:34:27,761
- Okay.
- Procet.

210
00:34:27,865 --> 00:34:29,196
What was that?

211
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:30,267
- Procet.
- It's okay.

212
00:34:30,368 --> 00:34:31,357
Okay.

213
00:34:31,469 --> 00:34:35,462
- That was actually Procet... Got that?
- Right.

214
00:34:35,573 --> 00:34:37,905
- But you need to call him Procet.
- Okay, Procet.

215
00:34:38,009 --> 00:34:39,203
That's what we call him.

216
00:34:39,310 --> 00:34:40,277
He's also Air America.

217
00:34:40,378 --> 00:34:42,573
- Also got shot down flying supplies...
- Okay, okay.

218
00:34:42,680 --> 00:34:43,738
...to royalist villages,

219
00:34:43,848 --> 00:34:46,009
- just like the rest of us.
- And when was that?

220
00:34:46,117 --> 00:34:48,779
Two... No, two and a half year ago now.

221
00:34:49,620 --> 00:34:52,214
- Two and a half years ago?
- Oh, yeah.

222
00:34:52,323 --> 00:34:55,451
I had no idea that we were here
for that long.

223
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:59,155
Yeah, been here a lot longer
than people know.

224
00:34:59,263 --> 00:35:01,458
- Duane Martin.
- Duane Martin. I'm Dieter Dengler.

225
00:35:01,566 --> 00:35:04,694
United States Air Force. I was shot down
about a year and a half ago.

226
00:35:04,802 --> 00:35:06,497
- Okay.
- And when this war starts,

227
00:35:06,604 --> 00:35:08,868
we'll be here a lot longer
than we already have.

228
00:35:08,973 --> 00:35:10,736
Well, you see...

229
00:35:11,476 --> 00:35:16,345
How many more times you think
I'm gonna have to say,

230
00:35:16,547 --> 00:35:21,246
like I been saying and saying and saying
and saying again,

231
00:35:21,352 --> 00:35:24,412
that we will never go to war
in Vietnam, man?

232
00:35:24,522 --> 00:35:25,784
No, they just...
- They, no...

233
00:35:25,890 --> 00:35:28,620
Because any day now... Listen.
They will what?

234
00:35:28,726 --> 00:35:30,660
- Yeah, Christmas come every day.
- They...

235
00:35:30,761 --> 00:35:31,785
They will release us, man.

236
00:35:32,997 --> 00:35:36,398
They will let us go any day now.

237
00:35:36,501 --> 00:35:38,401
- No, you see...
- Gene, by the way.

238
00:35:38,503 --> 00:35:40,164
- Gene.
- But listen.

239
00:35:41,205 --> 00:35:43,969
It's... The trick to it is it's actually Eugene.

240
00:35:44,075 --> 00:35:47,203
- Okay, Eugene.
- Eugene DeBruin from

241
00:35:47,311 --> 00:35:49,836
- Eugene, Oregon.
- Okay.

242
00:35:49,947 --> 00:35:51,915
- How do you like that?
- Yeah.

243
00:35:52,016 --> 00:35:54,484
See how that works out? Name, name...

244
00:35:54,585 --> 00:35:56,746
Jesus Christ, not this Oregon shit, again.

245
00:35:56,854 --> 00:35:59,550
I've heard this over 2,000 goddamn times.

246
00:35:59,657 --> 00:36:01,887
- Eugene from Eugene.
- Oh, yeah, right. Eugene from Eugene.

247
00:36:01,993 --> 00:36:03,426
- You know what? You know what? Listen.
- Yeah.

248
00:36:03,528 --> 00:36:07,362
What you really need to know is
you see this man here?

249
00:36:07,465 --> 00:36:09,660
Take a good look at him. He, he...

250
00:36:09,767 --> 00:36:16,172
Listen now, he shits in his pants
every night without fail, man.

251
00:36:16,274 --> 00:36:17,502
Trust me.

252
00:36:17,975 --> 00:36:21,138
And you know the only thing that he
thinks is worth complaining about?

253
00:36:21,245 --> 00:36:23,179
You know what that is?

254
00:36:23,281 --> 00:36:25,408
- This man right here.
- Right.

255
00:36:25,516 --> 00:36:27,848
- Eugene from Eugene.
- From Eugene.

256
00:36:28,452 --> 00:36:29,419
Okay.

257
00:36:34,492 --> 00:36:35,652
Dieter.

258
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:38,524
Take a careful look to your right.
You see that guy there?

259
00:36:38,629 --> 00:36:41,621
We call him Little Hitler
for a very good reason.

260
00:36:41,732 --> 00:36:43,290
He is the worst.

261
00:36:43,401 --> 00:36:46,370
This one we call Jumbo.

262
00:36:46,470 --> 00:36:48,062
Oh, wow.

263
00:36:48,172 --> 00:36:49,969
That's the first smile I've seen
since I was shot down.

264
00:36:50,074 --> 00:36:52,736
Yeah. He's, in fact,
one of the only truly nice guys here.

265
00:36:52,843 --> 00:36:57,542
This is Nook the Rook right here.
He's also very much not a nice guy.

266
00:37:00,017 --> 00:37:03,282
- What is his problem?
- It's all right. Just keep going.

267
00:37:03,387 --> 00:37:06,015
His problem is he's Crazy Horse.
That's what we call him.

268
00:37:06,123 --> 00:37:10,719
And he is a bastard. Keep going.
And I just cannot stand him.

269
00:37:10,828 --> 00:37:13,092
- That's Walkie Talkie.
- Walkie Talkie?

270
00:37:13,197 --> 00:37:16,792
We call him that 'cause he does not speak.
Never, never.

271
00:37:17,935 --> 00:37:21,427
Hey, do yourself a favor, Kraut.

272
00:37:21,539 --> 00:37:23,029
Keep your head down
and your mouth shut.

273
00:37:23,140 --> 00:37:25,700
That's your best chance of surviving.

274
00:37:45,830 --> 00:37:48,526
So there is a war.

275
00:37:52,837 --> 00:37:54,600
There is a war.

276
00:38:07,718 --> 00:38:10,778
All right. So tell me about
the peace talks, man. Geneva?

277
00:38:10,888 --> 00:38:13,322
There's got to be peace talks, man.

278
00:38:13,424 --> 00:38:16,325
Shut up, Gene.
There is no goddamn conference.

279
00:38:16,427 --> 00:38:17,519
When are you gonna get that
through your skull?

280
00:38:17,628 --> 00:38:20,426
Secret talks, man.
I'm just talking about secret talks.

281
00:38:20,531 --> 00:38:21,828
Forget it.

282
00:38:21,932 --> 00:38:23,194
We're not getting out.

283
00:38:23,301 --> 00:38:25,496
No, no, no, there was a honcho
on the outside,

284
00:38:25,603 --> 00:38:27,764
he said I would not be here too long.

285
00:38:27,872 --> 00:38:29,669
They tell that to everyone
to get them to sign.

286
00:38:29,774 --> 00:38:32,504
No, I did not sign. No.

287
00:38:34,612 --> 00:38:38,673
Anyway, nice having met you.

288
00:38:39,383 --> 00:38:41,044
What do you mean, met?

289
00:38:41,152 --> 00:38:44,679
Well, my friends,
you can rot in here if you like,

290
00:38:45,823 --> 00:38:48,849
but I'm gonna scram this very night.

291
00:38:49,994 --> 00:38:52,326
This hut, it ain't no prison.

292
00:38:54,899 --> 00:38:58,357
Scram. I like that. I like that.

293
00:38:58,469 --> 00:39:02,405
Listen, listen, my friend,
you cannot escape.

294
00:39:02,506 --> 00:39:05,907
If you try to escape,
you'll screw up our release.

295
00:39:06,010 --> 00:39:10,572
Look, I don't give a shit about our release
or whatever you think is gonna happen.

296
00:39:10,681 --> 00:39:15,914
But without water, you won't survive
more than two days out there.

297
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:19,820
And without water,
your tracks will be visible for even more.

298
00:39:20,858 --> 00:39:23,918
The jungle is the prison. Don't you get it?

299
00:39:26,664 --> 00:39:30,862
Hey, when does the rainy season start?

300
00:39:30,968 --> 00:39:32,833
Five months, maybe six.

301
00:39:33,938 --> 00:39:35,872
I can't wait that long.

302
00:39:35,973 --> 00:39:41,138
Hey, listen, let's say you do survive
the jungle and lack of water,

303
00:39:41,245 --> 00:39:45,147
whatever you find, snakes and animals
and shit are out there,

304
00:39:45,249 --> 00:39:47,114
you won't make it out of camp.

305
00:39:47,218 --> 00:39:49,948
There's six guards posted during the day.

306
00:39:52,356 --> 00:39:53,414
Yeah.

307
00:39:54,125 --> 00:39:55,990
That is during the day.

308
00:39:57,962 --> 00:39:59,657
I'm going at night.

309
00:40:08,539 --> 00:40:10,200
Why, what happens at night?

310
00:40:11,509 --> 00:40:12,476
No.

311
00:40:13,444 --> 00:40:14,411
No.

312
00:40:14,945 --> 00:40:15,912
No.

313
00:40:19,583 --> 00:40:21,813
I'm shitting my intestines out.

314
00:40:24,588 --> 00:40:25,919
Again.

315
00:40:26,023 --> 00:40:28,116
I'm sorry, I can't help it.

316
00:40:29,593 --> 00:40:33,495
You just shit right on my hand again, man.

317
00:40:33,597 --> 00:40:38,557
- Sorry.
- That makes it 2,207 times and counting.

318
00:40:38,669 --> 00:40:40,398
Leave the guy alone, okay?

319
00:40:40,504 --> 00:40:42,699
There ain't no alone, brother.

320
00:40:43,174 --> 00:40:45,267
Does anybody have a nail?

321
00:40:45,376 --> 00:40:47,139
What are you gonna do with a nail?

322
00:40:47,244 --> 00:40:50,077
You're gonna stab all the lousy guards
to death with a nail?

323
00:40:50,181 --> 00:40:52,547
What kind of plane you fly off of?

324
00:40:53,284 --> 00:40:56,276
- Procet has got a shard of glass, man.
- No, that's no good.

325
00:40:56,387 --> 00:40:57,581
I have porcupine needle.

326
00:40:57,688 --> 00:40:58,916
No.

327
00:40:59,924 --> 00:41:03,382
I've got a hammer and a socket wrench
stuffed up my ass.

328
00:41:06,730 --> 00:41:08,254
There's no nails.

329
00:41:08,365 --> 00:41:10,595
This whole prison's made
of bamboo and rattan.

330
00:41:10,701 --> 00:41:11,895
Damn it.

331
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:17,933
I know where there's a nail.

332
00:41:31,622 --> 00:41:32,714
Okay.

333
00:41:34,024 --> 00:41:35,889
I'm gonna make my move.

334
00:41:37,194 --> 00:41:39,856
So all of you scatter in
all directions, okay? Go.

335
00:41:39,964 --> 00:41:41,158
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

336
00:41:41,265 --> 00:41:46,032
What makes you think you're not crazy
for thinking that'll work, man?

337
00:41:46,136 --> 00:41:48,536
Eugene's right.
It'll attract too much attention.

338
00:41:48,672 --> 00:41:51,971
Oh, for God's sake, that's what I want.

339
00:41:52,076 --> 00:41:53,373
Please.

340
00:41:54,144 --> 00:41:56,476
You trust me? Please.

341
00:41:56,580 --> 00:41:59,743
Duane, head to the outhouse.

342
00:41:59,850 --> 00:42:02,250
Y.C., go to the top right. Okay?

343
00:42:02,353 --> 00:42:05,049
Gene, please come on. No, no, no.

344
00:42:05,155 --> 00:42:09,524
Gene, Phisit, Procet,
head towards the gate.

345
00:42:09,627 --> 00:42:11,561
Move as fast as you can.

346
00:42:12,296 --> 00:42:15,857
Get their attention, that's what I need.
Go, go, go, go. Go, go.

347
00:42:30,080 --> 00:42:32,480
Hey, Jumbo, Jumbo. Hey, no, no, no.

348
00:42:32,583 --> 00:42:37,043
Can I borrow some of the toothpaste?
Let me get some of that. That's good.

349
00:42:38,322 --> 00:42:41,416
I felt so like having a good smile,
you know?

350
00:42:41,525 --> 00:42:43,720
Like you have. You got a good smile, too.

351
00:42:45,729 --> 00:42:46,923
Okay.

352
00:42:53,337 --> 00:42:56,795
Y.C., when I hit it, you make a noise.

353
00:42:56,907 --> 00:42:58,602
Cough or something.

354
00:43:27,404 --> 00:43:28,701
I love it.

355
00:43:30,441 --> 00:43:32,341
I love it.

356
00:43:33,410 --> 00:43:35,640
I love it.

357
00:43:35,946 --> 00:43:39,780
I love it. I love it.

358
00:44:10,648 --> 00:44:12,343
Give me some slack.

359
00:44:13,317 --> 00:44:14,579
Let's see.

360
00:44:14,685 --> 00:44:18,143
Oh, God. Oh, God, that was an easy one.

361
00:44:21,158 --> 00:44:27,119
You see, I apprenticed as a tool
and die maker in Germany.

362
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:34,733
There was no aviation at the time
and I wanted to learn something useful

363
00:44:34,838 --> 00:44:36,601
that would help me repair planes.

364
00:44:36,707 --> 00:44:41,508
And, boy, are those years coming in handy
in unexpected ways now.

365
00:44:41,612 --> 00:44:44,012
There's only one brand
that I cannot handle,

366
00:44:44,114 --> 00:44:45,581
that is Smith and Wesson.

367
00:44:50,187 --> 00:44:55,648
I think with practice, I can open these up
in maybe two, three seconds flat.

368
00:44:58,962 --> 00:45:05,094
But listen, everybody keep one cuff
on a wrist at all times,

369
00:45:06,136 --> 00:45:10,038
so that if the guards come checking,
we can put them on again quickly.

370
00:45:10,140 --> 00:45:13,405
No, they don't check us at night.
They think we can't get out of these.

371
00:45:13,510 --> 00:45:15,410
They think it's impossible.

372
00:45:15,646 --> 00:45:17,614
Show me how you did that.

373
00:45:18,782 --> 00:45:21,717
It's so simple. Okay.

374
00:45:22,419 --> 00:45:25,650
All you do, insert the nail.

375
00:45:26,256 --> 00:45:29,316
There's a cuff and a spring.
They both have teeth.

376
00:45:29,426 --> 00:45:33,886
You push down on the spring,
disengage the teeth like that.

377
00:45:33,997 --> 00:45:37,194
You see? This is what happens inside.

378
00:45:39,036 --> 00:45:41,368
- And the cuffs release.
Wow.

379
00:45:42,706 --> 00:45:43,730
Hands free.

380
00:46:03,260 --> 00:46:04,488
Get away.

381
00:46:06,897 --> 00:46:07,921
Get away.

382
00:46:08,031 --> 00:46:11,967
No, no, no, no, no. Let him.
He's our friend, Malay.

383
00:46:12,069 --> 00:46:14,970
Let him do it. It's the best way
to heal sores around here.

384
00:46:15,072 --> 00:46:16,266
Okay.

385
00:46:16,673 --> 00:46:17,935
Hey,

386
00:46:19,009 --> 00:46:21,876
that cuff thing, that's good, real good.

387
00:46:21,979 --> 00:46:24,038
Yeah. Thanks.

388
00:46:25,382 --> 00:46:26,713
Hey, Duane,

389
00:46:28,519 --> 00:46:31,545
do you know where we are?
I mean, you have any idea?

390
00:46:31,655 --> 00:46:35,716
No. But my guess
is that this here's still Laos.

391
00:46:36,393 --> 00:46:38,361
And the guards, they're...

392
00:46:38,462 --> 00:46:39,520
- Laotian.
...Laotian?

393
00:46:39,630 --> 00:46:41,359
- Yeah.
- Yeah, but the camp is Vietcong,

394
00:46:41,465 --> 00:46:43,057
there's no question.

395
00:46:43,167 --> 00:46:45,601
Look, I know what you're thinking,

396
00:46:46,804 --> 00:46:49,739
but jungles on these mountains
is a nightmare.

397
00:46:52,176 --> 00:46:54,576
Besides, you'd end up in Vietnam.

398
00:46:54,678 --> 00:46:57,306
- No, but if we can get to Thailand...
- Yeah.

399
00:46:57,414 --> 00:46:59,041
If we can make it to the Mekong River...

400
00:46:59,149 --> 00:47:01,174
Yeah, the Big Muddy.
If you could, you would, right?

401
00:47:01,285 --> 00:47:02,718
Yeah. We can.

402
00:47:03,687 --> 00:47:06,417
- Hey, why not? We can.
- Yeah.

403
00:47:06,523 --> 00:47:09,048
Just stop talking about it. Okay?

404
00:47:09,159 --> 00:47:11,127
Just quiet. Excuse me.

405
00:47:14,464 --> 00:47:16,625
- Hey, Gene.
- Yeah.

406
00:47:18,936 --> 00:47:22,303
Which of you guys knows most
about the country?

407
00:47:22,439 --> 00:47:26,933
Oh, that would be Phisit,
but he doesn't talk to us.

408
00:47:27,277 --> 00:47:28,801
What do you mean?

409
00:47:28,912 --> 00:47:31,676
You see, Phisit is pissed about...

410
00:47:32,549 --> 00:47:33,743
About...

411
00:47:38,088 --> 00:47:39,453
He's pissed about something.

412
00:47:39,556 --> 00:47:43,822
We don't even remember
what he's pissed about.

413
00:48:03,580 --> 00:48:04,604
Hey!

414
00:48:05,282 --> 00:48:06,306
Hey!

415
00:48:07,384 --> 00:48:09,284
Hey, come back!

416
00:48:11,255 --> 00:48:12,847
Hey!

417
00:48:15,092 --> 00:48:17,117
I can't believe that bastard shot you.

418
00:48:17,227 --> 00:48:20,162
I know. I didn't even pull down
my flight suit.

419
00:48:20,264 --> 00:48:22,630
Hey, look, when I was standing
it looked like...

420
00:48:24,735 --> 00:48:26,896
We're gonna get even one day.

421
00:48:34,878 --> 00:48:36,004
Howdy.

422
00:48:44,855 --> 00:48:46,345
Americali.

423
00:48:49,059 --> 00:48:53,155
- Americali.
- Americali. Americali. Americali.

424
00:49:15,452 --> 00:49:18,046
Two years ago a parcel came through.

425
00:49:20,691 --> 00:49:21,749
Yeah.

426
00:49:22,659 --> 00:49:25,423
He puts it on display on really bad days.

427
00:49:27,397 --> 00:49:30,662
The bacon label still looks greasy.

428
00:49:31,535 --> 00:49:33,435
Does it still have a scent on it?

429
00:49:33,537 --> 00:49:34,902
Oh, you bet.

430
00:49:36,940 --> 00:49:38,407
Can I get a sniff?

431
00:49:38,508 --> 00:49:40,203
Oh, no, you may not.

432
00:49:41,278 --> 00:49:43,769
You may not. That is my sniff.

433
00:49:44,614 --> 00:49:46,980
Man, that is my sniff.

434
00:50:00,597 --> 00:50:01,621
Hey.

435
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:05,395
How'd you ever end up a pilot?

436
00:50:07,070 --> 00:50:09,732
I always... I always wanted to be one.

437
00:50:10,774 --> 00:50:12,071
I was

438
00:50:13,377 --> 00:50:17,780
five years old, or something, in a little
town, Wildberg, in the Black Forest,

439
00:50:17,881 --> 00:50:21,214
and it was just bombed to ashes,
you know?

440
00:50:21,318 --> 00:50:24,185
No clear reason,
just these senseless attacks.

441
00:50:25,622 --> 00:50:30,525
But I remember I was in the attic
with my brother.

442
00:50:32,295 --> 00:50:34,024
We were looking out,

443
00:50:34,798 --> 00:50:38,029
and we see this fighter plane,

444
00:50:38,635 --> 00:50:42,127
beautiful, coming right at us.

445
00:50:43,140 --> 00:50:45,005
And it's firing from its wings,

446
00:50:45,108 --> 00:50:49,238
and I see the machine gun,
it's flashing and it

447
00:50:51,715 --> 00:50:53,239
goes flying past the house.

448
00:50:53,350 --> 00:50:58,378
It's so close. I mean,
it's feet away from the house.

449
00:51:00,257 --> 00:51:03,192
And the canopy was open.

450
00:51:04,895 --> 00:51:10,333
And this pilot,
he had his goggles up on his helmet.

451
00:51:11,668 --> 00:51:13,636
And I could see his eyes.

452
00:51:14,571 --> 00:51:16,664
And he was looking at me.

453
00:51:17,574 --> 00:51:18,871
Right at me.

454
00:51:18,975 --> 00:51:20,670
He's looking right at me.

455
00:51:20,777 --> 00:51:24,235
And as he turns to go, he's starting back,
he's looking right at me still.

456
00:51:24,347 --> 00:51:26,042
And the thing is,

457
00:51:26,850 --> 00:51:30,377
from that moment on, little Dieter,

458
00:51:31,588 --> 00:51:33,453
he needed to fly.

459
00:51:36,626 --> 00:51:38,787
You're a strange bird, Dieter.

460
00:51:39,396 --> 00:51:42,297
Guy tries to kill you and you want his job.

461
00:51:46,803 --> 00:51:48,202
Yeah.

462
00:52:18,969 --> 00:52:20,903
God, we need the rain.

463
00:52:21,972 --> 00:52:24,338
We need the rain to come quicker.

464
00:52:28,011 --> 00:52:33,278
See, here's what I can see,
you still need to understand.

465
00:52:33,383 --> 00:52:36,910
- No, I understand.
- You wanna talk about the rain again, we...

466
00:52:37,020 --> 00:52:38,920
Listen, now. Listen.

467
00:52:39,022 --> 00:52:43,891
We will be released
by the time the rain comes

468
00:52:43,994 --> 00:52:45,621
like I have told you before...

469
00:52:45,729 --> 00:52:49,096
- Stop telling me.
- I don't wanna have to keep telling you.

470
00:52:49,199 --> 00:52:52,134
- Then stop telling me.
- They will release us.

471
00:52:52,235 --> 00:52:53,361
You understand?

472
00:52:53,470 --> 00:52:55,233
And here's what I'm starting to think,

473
00:52:55,338 --> 00:52:58,364
that maybe you're trying
not to understand.

474
00:52:58,475 --> 00:53:02,502
If you try and escape, we,

475
00:53:03,280 --> 00:53:06,249
we will be killed,
we who you leave behind.

476
00:53:06,349 --> 00:53:09,011
- It's not just me, we all try to escape.
- Taking off. We who have been here

477
00:53:09,119 --> 00:53:11,053
for two years.

478
00:53:11,154 --> 00:53:12,985
Two years before you showed up.

479
00:53:13,089 --> 00:53:15,683
I don't want to escape alone.
We escape together.

480
00:53:15,792 --> 00:53:18,659
Wait, wait.
Why would the guards spend all this time

481
00:53:18,795 --> 00:53:21,559
cutting bamboo and wood
to build a watchtower

482
00:53:21,665 --> 00:53:23,360
if we weren't meant
to be here for a while?

483
00:53:23,466 --> 00:53:24,455
- Exactly.
- Two years.

484
00:53:24,568 --> 00:53:26,627
- Exactly. Why would they do that if they...
- Listen. Listen to me.

485
00:53:26,736 --> 00:53:29,705
...didn't plan to hold us a long time?
- Listen. Here's what it all comes down to.

486
00:53:29,806 --> 00:53:34,140
I am not, I'm not gonna let you do that.

487
00:53:34,244 --> 00:53:35,438
No, no, no.

488
00:53:35,545 --> 00:53:37,206
You know what I am gonna do?

489
00:53:37,314 --> 00:53:38,941
I am gonna scream.

490
00:53:39,482 --> 00:53:42,713
That's right. I think
I'm gonna scream my head off.

491
00:53:48,692 --> 00:53:52,753
'Cause see,
I would much rather they shoot you,

492
00:53:52,862 --> 00:53:56,389
than me, or any of us. You understand?

493
00:53:58,768 --> 00:53:59,757
Yeah.

494
00:53:59,869 --> 00:54:02,030
You understand?

495
00:54:02,138 --> 00:54:03,298
Yeah.

496
00:54:04,941 --> 00:54:06,636
You've been warned.

497
00:54:07,711 --> 00:54:09,042
Haven't you?

498
00:55:16,613 --> 00:55:18,911
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

499
00:55:20,050 --> 00:55:21,881
This is for shaving.

500
00:55:23,420 --> 00:55:24,682
Howdy.

501
00:55:36,333 --> 00:55:39,325
- Man, I can't get over it.
- What, this?

502
00:55:39,436 --> 00:55:41,563
No, that girl, you know?

503
00:55:41,671 --> 00:55:43,263
She smiled at me.

504
00:55:43,840 --> 00:55:46,070
And when she smiled,

505
00:55:47,377 --> 00:55:51,108
man, did I wish there was no war.

506
00:55:51,214 --> 00:55:52,203
Really.

507
00:55:52,315 --> 00:55:55,148
- I thought you were engaged.
- Oh, yeah, I am.

508
00:55:55,251 --> 00:55:57,048
We got engaged the day before I left.

509
00:55:57,153 --> 00:56:01,647
Marina, she is a wonderful girl.
So smart, you know?

510
00:56:01,758 --> 00:56:03,988
She studies marine biology.

511
00:56:04,094 --> 00:56:06,688
But I hope that she's waiting for me.

512
00:56:09,566 --> 00:56:12,034
- I'm sure she is.
- Yeah, well, she said she would,

513
00:56:12,135 --> 00:56:14,603
but, you know, women can be funny
and go looking for another man...

514
00:56:31,755 --> 00:56:32,915
Duane, you okay?

515
00:56:33,022 --> 00:56:34,751
- Yeah.
- Y.C.?

516
00:56:34,858 --> 00:56:35,825
Yik Chiu Tuo, okay.

517
00:56:35,925 --> 00:56:37,688
Okay. Gene?

518
00:56:37,794 --> 00:56:39,227
Phisit? Procet?

519
00:56:39,329 --> 00:56:40,421
Yeah.

520
00:57:07,757 --> 00:57:10,419
<i>Happy birthday to you.</i>

521
00:57:11,961 --> 00:57:15,624
<i>Happy birthday to you.</i>

522
00:57:17,267 --> 00:57:20,134
<i>Happy birthday, dear Dieter.</i>

523
00:57:20,670 --> 00:57:23,571
<i>Happy birthday to you.</i>

524
00:57:24,174 --> 00:57:25,937
It is May the 22nd?

525
00:57:26,509 --> 00:57:27,703
Happy birthday.

526
00:57:27,811 --> 00:57:29,745
- Thank you.
- Happy birthday, Dieter.

527
00:57:29,846 --> 00:57:32,110
What kind of champagne is this?

528
00:57:32,215 --> 00:57:34,775
You just got to keep thinking protein,
lots of protein.

529
00:57:34,884 --> 00:57:36,351
It's not bad.

530
00:57:36,753 --> 00:57:38,778
Squished insect larva.

531
00:57:40,957 --> 00:57:42,151
Protein.

532
00:57:42,892 --> 00:57:43,859
Mmm.

533
00:57:45,395 --> 00:57:47,863
Oh, this is a good year, this one.

534
00:57:48,364 --> 00:57:49,922
Yeah, my favorite.

535
00:57:50,033 --> 00:57:51,591
So, listen, guys.

536
00:57:52,035 --> 00:57:53,696
Thank you so much.

537
00:57:53,803 --> 00:57:55,668
And it is my birthday, yes,

538
00:57:55,772 --> 00:57:58,866
but I would like
to give you some presents.

539
00:57:58,975 --> 00:58:01,307
Okay. Now, look.

540
00:58:02,011 --> 00:58:07,506
I have taken these cartridge shells
and I have made a knife of each one.

541
00:58:08,518 --> 00:58:09,815
Okay.

542
00:58:09,919 --> 00:58:14,618
Now, I'm sorry, but I have to keep one
for myself. Okay?

543
00:58:15,191 --> 00:58:16,920
Duane, you're first.

544
00:58:17,594 --> 00:58:18,720
Right.

545
00:58:21,498 --> 00:58:22,658
Phisit.

546
00:58:23,199 --> 00:58:24,666
Left or right?

547
00:58:26,836 --> 00:58:27,962
Y.C.

548
00:58:29,706 --> 00:58:31,264
Easy money, pal.

549
00:58:33,743 --> 00:58:34,801
Gene.

550
00:58:38,014 --> 00:58:41,848
- Procet, it is yours. Okay.
- I don't care about the knife.

551
00:58:41,951 --> 00:58:42,975
This is for Crazy Horse.

552
00:58:43,086 --> 00:58:45,816
No, no, no. Crazy Horse is mine.

553
00:58:45,922 --> 00:58:48,857
My Crazy Horse. Mine.

554
00:58:49,826 --> 00:58:54,388
Now listen, we must collect the rice
and hide it.

555
00:58:55,098 --> 00:58:58,590
But we must dry it because it rots
too quickly if we don't dry it, okay?

556
00:58:58,701 --> 00:59:00,760
What? Hide it? You wanna hide it?

557
00:59:00,870 --> 00:59:02,167
- Yeah, yeah.
- We can eat it now.

558
00:59:02,272 --> 00:59:03,500
- No, no.
- We eat it now.

559
00:59:03,606 --> 00:59:07,599
Look, look, look, I've created
a secret compartment here for the rice.

560
00:59:07,710 --> 00:59:11,806
It is at the bottom of my crap container.

561
00:59:11,948 --> 00:59:13,142
So I don't think the guards

562
00:59:13,249 --> 00:59:15,479
- are gonna want to check that.
- Crazy. This is...

563
00:59:16,686 --> 00:59:18,210
Why are you hiding it now?

564
00:59:18,321 --> 00:59:19,811
For our escape.

565
00:59:23,493 --> 00:59:25,051
You have a plan.

566
00:59:25,495 --> 00:59:26,519
Yes.

567
00:59:27,297 --> 00:59:30,130
Now, have you noticed

568
00:59:30,233 --> 00:59:33,327
that the guards when they are called
to the kitchen hut for chow time,

569
00:59:33,436 --> 00:59:35,404
they always leave
their rifles behind, always?

570
00:59:35,505 --> 00:59:39,669
So we have a few minutes
before they return for their rifles.

571
00:59:39,776 --> 00:59:42,677
We go out through the hut,
we grab their guns,

572
00:59:42,779 --> 00:59:43,973
- we surprise them.
- No.

573
00:59:44,080 --> 00:59:46,947
- And we surprise... We surprise them...
- Crazy.

574
00:59:47,050 --> 00:59:48,677
...and we surround them, okay?

575
00:59:48,785 --> 00:59:52,721
Then we take the guards as prisoners.

576
00:59:52,822 --> 00:59:55,620
We take over the camp.
Think about it, okay?

577
00:59:55,725 --> 00:59:59,786
We hold it down for a few days
until we can signal our aircraft

578
01:00:01,230 --> 01:00:02,697
to pick us up.

579
01:00:24,921 --> 01:00:26,354
- Dieter, quick.
- Okay.

580
01:00:29,225 --> 01:00:30,817
They'll call mess any second.

581
01:00:32,528 --> 01:00:34,018
Quick, quick.
