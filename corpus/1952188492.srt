1
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:10,680
What's with this guy?
Hey!

2
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:15,160
You see me here?
I'm walking!

3
00:00:33,460 --> 00:00:35,220
Hey, I like your short skirt.

4
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:37,260
I like your buns.

5
00:00:42,380 --> 00:00:44,940
Genevieve, I'm on Date Four
and I'm outta ideas.

6
00:00:45,020 --> 00:00:48,260
<i>- Water-taxi tour of the bridges.
- Thank you!</i>

7
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:52,620
- How you doing, Genevieve?
- Hi.

8
00:01:37,540 --> 00:01:38,700
Valentine's Day.

9
00:01:40,940 --> 00:01:43,500
I'm telling you,
he'd better buy you something.

10
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:46,820
You know what? Valentine's Day
is just a dumb made-up holiday.

11
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:48,940
I love Valentine's Day.

12
00:01:49,180 --> 00:01:51,540
Yeah? Well, I don't know
one guy who does.

13
00:01:52,460 --> 00:01:53,580
It sucks!

14
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:56,580
- Hi, crazy.
- Hi, Bill and Bob.

15
00:02:08,380 --> 00:02:09,300
- Oops.
- Uh-oh.

16
00:02:09,940 --> 00:02:12,420
- Good morning.
- Not with these eyebrows.

17
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:13,420
Let's see.

18
00:02:13,820 --> 00:02:16,460
- They've gone G.I. Joe.
- Help me.

19
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:23,820
Very Madonna.

20
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:26,140
- Swears?
- Her eighties phase.

21
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:28,060
The second time,
in two thousand seven.

22
00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:37,900
Yes, well, Madonna post-tour
for sure.

23
00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:40,820
Yeah, long tour.
Eyebrows grow back.

24
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:42,260
Hey, my eyebrows grow back fast.

25
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:43,980
Pluck the hair
and there's nothing there.

26
00:02:44,020 --> 00:02:44,980
- Oops.
- Uh-oh.

27
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:49,580
Good morning.
How're my ladies?

28
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:53,500
- Tim! Tim, delivered.
- Tim, hi.

29
00:02:54,740 --> 00:02:57,180
Well, Tim, that shirt...

30
00:02:57,260 --> 00:02:59,660
Iooks a lot less wrinkled
than normal.

31
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:01,220
Is it, I dare say, ironed?

32
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:04,940
- Are you trying to impress someone?
- Yeah, you. Give me a dirty kiss.

33
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:07,020
Let's see if you can turn me.

34
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:11,500
I can't!

35
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:14,460
Give me that.

36
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:15,580
I take that.

37
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:18,580
- What would you do without them?
- Oops and Uh-oh?

38
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:19,700
<i>- Oops.
- Uh-oh.</i>

39
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:22,380
Lose my mind.
How's it going for you?

40
00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:25,300
Lexy and Dominique
have that flu.

41
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:28,180
Now I think Annie is getting it.
She's crabby.

42
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:30,660
- 'Cause she's sick?
- No, 'cause she's Annie.

43
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:34,140
You know, I've gotta do something for
Valentine's Day. I'm freaking out.

44
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:37,300
I'll wrap up a dozen roses
with some chocolate hearts.

45
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:38,300
Is that enough?

46
00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:41,500
Yeah. All women want to know is that
you put some thought into it.

47
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:43,420
How many men are gonna
wake up in a cold sweat tomorrow?

48
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:45,220
They wait till the last moment
they put if off...

49
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:47,180
then they're on their way home
and everything's closed...

50
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:48,660
and they're panicking
in a Seven-Eleven...

51
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:50,700
saying, "Do you have any chocolates
in a heart shaped box?"

52
00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:53,500
Yeah, my wife's gonna love my gut
'cause I'm more romantic?

53
00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:54,540
Yes.

54
00:03:55,540 --> 00:03:56,980
Less vitamins, okay?

55
00:03:57,180 --> 00:03:58,780
Are my eyebrows holding up?

56
00:03:58,940 --> 00:04:02,260
Hey, will you do mine? I have date
Number One tomorrow with a cute new guy.

57
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:05,020
- New guy!
- Let me get you those roses.

58
00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:09,860
What happened to the other guy?

59
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:12,500
- Five dates.
- So it's over.

60
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:15,900
- Ends it before the guy can.
- Got the safety set on her heart.

61
00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:18,700
- That's a country song.
- From her album, "Fear of Commitment".

62
00:04:18,740 --> 00:04:20,700
Hi. Guess what?
I can hear you.

63
00:04:20,780 --> 00:04:24,740
It is not wrong that I want every day
to be Valentine's Day.

64
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:26,660
- No!
- Here you go.

65
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:29,060
- For Annie.
- Thank you, thank you, thank you.

66
00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:30,580
All right, you guys.

67
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:33,260
Dress up again for us tomorrow.

68
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:35,980
- Yeah, maybe I'll wear deodorant.
- Why start now?

69
00:04:36,380 --> 00:04:37,780
Have a nice day.

70
00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:41,620
Okay, we've got to reorganize this
fridge. Just move that over there...

71
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:44,300
move this over here.
It's gonna be crazy in here tomorrow.

72
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:02,620
Uh-uh, I call shotgun.
Hi.

73
00:05:03,980 --> 00:05:06,340
I'm Genevieve.
May I help you?

74
00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:09,540
Hi.

75
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:10,900
I saw you at the old pizza place.

76
00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:12,900
What? You're not thinking
of buying it, are you?

77
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:15,020
It's been a ribs place
and a chicken wings place...

78
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:16,220
and everybody goes bankrupt.

79
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:17,740
That place is cursed.

80
00:05:18,420 --> 00:05:19,780
I just bought it.

81
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:21,580
- Congratulations!
- Awesome!

82
00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:22,540
- That's amazing!
- Yay!

83
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:24,740
Yeah, I'm reopening it
as a tapas bar.

84
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:26,180
What's it called?

85
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:27,660
Get on Tapas.

86
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:35,260
Get on Tapas. Get it?
A tapas bar.

87
00:05:37,980 --> 00:05:39,260
Are you Spanish?

88
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:40,980
No.

89
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:43,020
Why are you opening
a tapas place?

90
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:46,980
Well, I saw this graph of recent
graduates from my law school...

91
00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:49,780
and statistically, I was right
where it said I should be.

92
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:53,860
Felt a little cookie-cuttered, had
a one-third life crisis. Quit the firm.

93
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:56,860
- That's nuts.
- Anyway...

94
00:05:57,820 --> 00:06:00,140
I'm here to get some flowers
for my girlfriend.

95
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:02,300
Your girlfriend.

96
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:03,620
Excellent.

97
00:06:05,260 --> 00:06:07,500
- Very romantic.
- What's over here?

98
00:06:07,780 --> 00:06:09,460
Good, good.
Because...

99
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:13,220
I'll be honest, I'm kind of
on shaky ground with this one.

100
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:16,220
I grew up in Atlanta
and down there...

101
00:06:16,420 --> 00:06:19,820
if a date turned into the morning after
that's your girlfriend now.

102
00:06:20,860 --> 00:06:22,860
But I don't know
if this is my girlfriend...

103
00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:24,700
or if it's just somebody
I'm dating.

104
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:27,180
- Well, how long has it been?
- Two months.

105
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:29,300
Sounds like a girlfriend to me.

106
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:33,220
Okay.
So I'll take these.

107
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:37,300
These are for friendship.

108
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:39,820
Now for Valentine's Day...

109
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:44,380
these are for girlfriends.

110
00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:46,220
I did not know that.

111
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:49,620
So, do you know
if she's home right now?

112
00:06:49,940 --> 00:06:54,220
No. She's a flight attendant and
she's out of town. She travels a lot.

113
00:06:54,460 --> 00:06:58,100
You know what would be romantic?
You get the landlord to let you in...

114
00:06:58,180 --> 00:07:01,940
and then you leave these
beside her bedside.

115
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:09,940
That's a great idea.

116
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:13,580
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

117
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:20,780
Happy Valentine's Day.

118
00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:23,820
Happy Valentine's Day.

119
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:31,740
- Why'd you say that, Genevieve?
- What?

120
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:34,220
- That poor guy.
- That old line. She's not "traveling".

121
00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:35,420
She's got three boyfriends.

122
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:38,580
<i>Guys like that
never see it coming.</i>

123
00:07:38,660 --> 00:07:40,460
<i>- How'd you get in?
- Boy.</i>

124
00:07:40,540 --> 00:07:42,780
<i>He's the type of guy who doesn't know
he's good-looking...</i>

125
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:45,340
<i>and goes and gives a woman his heart
and he gets stomped on.</i>

126
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:50,060
<i>Over and over and over again.</i>

127
00:07:56,180 --> 00:07:58,660
<i>No Dijon! You'll take
American mustard and like it.</i>

128
00:07:58,820 --> 00:08:02,100
- Okay.
- That's dumb. Soap can't get dirty.

129
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:04,660
- Lf mud fell on it.
- It would wash right off.

130
00:08:04,780 --> 00:08:07,020
Wouldn't the mud be
declared clean on impact?

131
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:10,300
Right, it's soap!
The word means clean.

132
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:11,500
What, like, in Latin?

133
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:14,940
Thanks, Mom,
but that's Valentine's Day.

134
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:16,940
<i>Can you make beef stroganoff
with chicken?</i>

135
00:08:16,980 --> 00:08:20,300
Yes. You can definitely
substitute chicken.

136
00:08:20,380 --> 00:08:22,540
<i>- With Egg Beaters?
- Or Egg Beaters.</i>

137
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:24,620
<i>- It'll be too sticky.
- Okay, I gotta go.</i>

138
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:26,380
Yeah, bye. Yeah, bye.

139
00:08:26,420 --> 00:08:27,980
<i>- Yeah, bye.
- Bye- bye.</i>

140
00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:30,580
Hey, get your meat paws
off my food.

141
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:32,020
All right, everyone.

142
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:34,820
What are the plans for
Valentine's Day?

143
00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:36,620
It's too much pressure.

144
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:39,100
My skull is gonna cave in.

145
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:41,260
All right, it's the celebration
of romance.

146
00:08:41,340 --> 00:08:43,820
Not if you've been single
since pubes.

147
00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:48,500
Kathy, what about the guy
you see on the bus every day?

148
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:50,500
I'm taking your advice,
I'm waiting to be wooed.

149
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:53,100
- Good.
- Although I did accidentally...

150
00:08:53,140 --> 00:08:54,380
kick his seat.

151
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:56,660
Very nice.
Dan?

152
00:08:58,060 --> 00:09:02,020
I bought a girl at work
some chocolates.

153
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:03,860
That's really sweet.

154
00:09:04,340 --> 00:09:05,580
- Yeah?
- Yes.

155
00:09:07,540 --> 00:09:09,020
Very good.
Brian?

156
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:12,700
I think I'm gonna bake the girl
at the newsstand a cake.

157
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:13,980
It's not funny.

158
00:09:14,140 --> 00:09:15,540
- That's nice.
- Yeah?

159
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:17,940
- Yeah.
- Hey, hey, hey, sorry I'm late!

160
00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:19,020
- Hi.
- Hi.

161
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:20,980
Sorry, y'all, I was late.
I know.

162
00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:26,220
Java Joint guy asked me out.

163
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:27,980
- You already went there?
- Yup.

164
00:09:28,460 --> 00:09:29,940
Have you Googled him?

165
00:09:30,380 --> 00:09:31,860
He was a total chubster
in middle school...

166
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:34,340
but then he played football
in high school and he lost the weight.

167
00:09:34,420 --> 00:09:37,820
And his mom's a teacher
and his dad sells used cars.

168
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:40,780
I went back and I told him
his best friend's name in high school...

169
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:43,340
and that it would be a perfect name
for our first child.

170
00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:49,660
- Weird?
- Lf weird means spooky.

171
00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:51,620
Hey, you have to wait
to be wooed.

172
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:55,660
Anyway, we have a date tonight.

173
00:09:56,020 --> 00:09:57,820
I really don't wanna
mess this one up.

174
00:09:57,900 --> 00:10:00,980
Then don't text him eighty-two times
between now and then.

175
00:10:01,060 --> 00:10:02,700
Yes. Wait to be wooed.

176
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:06,300
And then you have five dates.
And that's all.

177
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:07,380
Okay.

178
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:09,420
Just tell me what to do
one more time.

179
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:13,260
All right. Date One:
Breathless flirting.

180
00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:15,980
Date Two:
Tummy flip flops.

181
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:18,860
Date Three:
The adventurous date.

182
00:10:19,060 --> 00:10:21,220
Date Four:
Be fun and fabulous.

183
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:23,660
- I'm always fun and fabulous.
- Date Five...

184
00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:27,980
make it the best date ever.
And then you say good-bye.

185
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:31,100
When the romance is gone,
it's time to move on.

186
00:10:31,460 --> 00:10:34,540
He'll only remember you
with sweet soft memories.

187
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:38,060
And you?
You will never be hurt again.

188
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:42,260
Okay.
I'm totally doing it your way.

189
00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:46,060
- And keep those knees together.
- Dang.

190
00:10:56,660 --> 00:10:58,380
- Happy Valentine's Day!
- Thank you!

191
00:10:58,460 --> 00:11:01,220
Happy Valentine's Day!
Happy Valentine's Day!

192
00:11:01,580 --> 00:11:04,700
Hi, happy Valentine's Day.
Happy Valentine's Day!

193
00:11:04,780 --> 00:11:07,620
Hi, guys,
happy Valentine's Day.

194
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:10,140
- Hi, happy Valentine's Day!
- Thanks.

195
00:11:10,220 --> 00:11:12,780
Happy Valentine's Day!
Happy Valentine's Day!

196
00:11:14,420 --> 00:11:16,860
- Happy Valentine's Day!
- Help!

197
00:11:19,060 --> 00:11:20,300
Welcome back.

198
00:11:20,420 --> 00:11:21,300
This sucks.

199
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:23,740
Let's go in.

200
00:11:24,940 --> 00:11:26,340
I can't see you.

201
00:11:27,340 --> 00:11:28,340
Hiya, Greg.

202
00:11:28,660 --> 00:11:30,380
Happy V-Day, buddy.

203
00:11:32,660 --> 00:11:35,020
Wow, look at this place.

204
00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:37,620
Big mistake.

205
00:11:40,340 --> 00:11:41,900
Where are you taking her tonight?

206
00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:44,380
What's with that?

207
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:47,180
For setting me up
with a flight attendant.

208
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:49,820
Yeah, let's go meet
some flight attendants.

209
00:11:49,940 --> 00:11:52,540
- I just got dumped by one.
- One what?

210
00:11:52,660 --> 00:11:54,860
A flight attendant.
The one you set me up with.

211
00:11:55,820 --> 00:11:56,900
How'd that go?

212
00:11:57,860 --> 00:12:00,940
- Do you ever listen?
- Well, then I'd have to hear you, buddy.

213
00:12:01,940 --> 00:12:04,460
She said my actions let her know
that we weren't exclusive.

214
00:12:04,540 --> 00:12:06,220
I thought we were exclusive.

215
00:12:06,540 --> 00:12:07,460
So?

216
00:12:07,780 --> 00:12:11,100
So it's my fault once again,
for not understanding The Game.

217
00:12:11,380 --> 00:12:12,940
No, there's no game tonight.

218
00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:18,860
<i>Well, I don't think long-term
relationships work.</i>

219
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:21,580
- I haven't had a relationship in a year.
- Really?

220
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:23,220
- Yeah.
- Here, enjoy.

221
00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:25,820
And you seem like a fun guy.

222
00:12:26,060 --> 00:12:29,340
I'm sorry. Pardon,
I just wanna take this. It's my friend.

223
00:12:29,420 --> 00:12:31,780
She keeps calling
and I'm a bit worried about her.

224
00:12:32,060 --> 00:12:33,300
I'll be right with you.

225
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:36,020
<i>Hi, Tammy. Are you okay?
Aren't you on a date?</i>

226
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:38,420
<i>- Hello?
- God.</i>

227
00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:44,060
I downloaded Coffee Guy's
yearbook photos...

228
00:12:44,580 --> 00:12:46,580
and I made him a scrapbook.

229
00:12:46,820 --> 00:12:48,340
<i>And he blanched...</i>

230
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:49,940
and ran out.

231
00:12:52,060 --> 00:12:53,380
I'm so sorry.

232
00:12:57,300 --> 00:12:59,220
You're watching
"Jerry Maguire" again.

233
00:13:01,140 --> 00:13:02,340
<i>- No.
- Listen to me.</i>

234
00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:04,340
Nobody completes anybody!

235
00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:06,380
<i>Tammy, you're the best.
I'll call you when I get home.</i>

236
00:13:06,460 --> 00:13:08,060
<i>- Turn off the TV!
- Okay.</i>

237
00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:10,580
Hi.

238
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:14,540
So, wait, wait. Let's... let's go back
to what you were talking about.

239
00:13:14,620 --> 00:13:17,260
You don't want a relationship?

240
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:20,820
Yes, I do not want a relationship.

241
00:13:21,460 --> 00:13:23,900
They're just an emotional cage...

242
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:27,180
that sad couples peek
from behind the bars of...

243
00:13:27,380 --> 00:13:29,660
Iooking at all us
happy single people...

244
00:13:29,780 --> 00:13:33,660
wondering what fear of being alone
made them say "I do".

245
00:13:35,060 --> 00:13:37,780
So, you're some kind of swinger?

246
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:40,380
What just happened?

247
00:13:50,540 --> 00:13:51,620
- Oops.
- Uh-oh.

248
00:13:52,820 --> 00:13:53,740
Okay.

249
00:14:03,340 --> 00:14:05,660
I can just imagine
the tapas on that.

250
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:08,940
- Hi.
- Hi.

251
00:14:10,420 --> 00:14:12,060
It looks great in here.

252
00:14:12,340 --> 00:14:14,140
Well, thanks.

253
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:15,620
So...

254
00:14:16,180 --> 00:14:17,980
- you're opening soon.
- No.

255
00:14:18,940 --> 00:14:20,340
Yes, I guess.

256
00:14:20,540 --> 00:14:23,660
I was thinking, I would like to provide
your floral arrangements.

257
00:14:24,260 --> 00:14:25,180
Well...

258
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:28,500
I didn't put flowers in my budget.

259
00:14:29,460 --> 00:14:33,140
I'm sorry. I thought you just said
you didn't put flowers into your budget.

260
00:14:33,460 --> 00:14:35,020
- I did.
- Take it back.

261
00:14:36,380 --> 00:14:37,300
What?

262
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:39,660
Greg, with all due respect...

263
00:14:39,860 --> 00:14:42,140
you're making a huge mistake.

264
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:46,260
A new restaurant is not
just about the food.

265
00:14:46,460 --> 00:14:49,420
It's about ambiance
and soul.

266
00:14:49,620 --> 00:14:52,500
Now, flowers provide a salve
to our senses...

267
00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:55,620
because aesthetic beauty calms us
and soothes us.

268
00:14:55,740 --> 00:14:59,540
Which means, customers
will feel good here.

269
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:02,620
They will linger,
they'll order more wine...

270
00:15:02,740 --> 00:15:05,660
which means they'll have dessert
and they will leave happy.

271
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:07,980
And they will go home
and they're gonna make love.

272
00:15:08,180 --> 00:15:11,060
They will wake up in a great mood
and then tell everybody...

273
00:15:11,140 --> 00:15:15,140
about the fabulous new tapas restaurant
they just went to.

274
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:18,660
Flowers do all that?

275
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:20,620
Yes.

276
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:28,140
How much?

277
00:15:28,660 --> 00:15:29,700
Not much.

278
00:15:33,060 --> 00:15:33,940
You're good.

279
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:36,500
Who told you?

280
00:15:41,860 --> 00:15:44,540
<i>- Mom call-waiting. I should go.
- I should tile my patio.</i>

281
00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:46,380
<i>On "Martha Stewart,"
she did it on her own.</i>

282
00:15:46,460 --> 00:15:49,340
<i>She even fired her own tiles
in a homemade kiln.</i>

283
00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:51,980
<i>I'll bet she can glaze a ham
with her feet.</i>

284
00:15:52,060 --> 00:15:55,540
<i>Okay, why did I call?
Let me see, now I can't remember.</i>

285
00:15:55,700 --> 00:15:57,020
<i>Yes, yes, yes.</i>

286
00:15:57,180 --> 00:16:00,820
<i>What was the name of the man
who had the dog that looked like a cat?</i>

287
00:16:00,940 --> 00:16:01,860
Okay...

288
00:16:02,180 --> 00:16:03,100
<i>He died.</i>

289
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:07,140
I'm sorry.
All right, I'll send some flowers.

290
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:08,940
<i>- Okay.
- Okay. Yeah, bye.</i>

291
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:11,460
<i>- Yeah, bye. Yeah, bye.
- Bye- bye.</i>

292
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:16,140
<i>One new message.</i>

293
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:18,940
<i>Hi, Genevieve.
It's me, your dad.</i>

294
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:22,500
<i>Just calling to say hi
and see what you're up to.</i>

295
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:24,820
<i>Give me a call some time.</i>

296
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:32,620
Then why is it called a lawn mower
and not just a mower...

297
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:34,740
since you don't mow anything
but a lawn?

298
00:16:34,820 --> 00:16:36,660
You could get mowed down
by a car.

299
00:16:36,820 --> 00:16:39,340
- Yeah, but not with a lawn mower. See?
- Yes, you could.

300
00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:42,220
If it was running on your lawn and you
bent over, it could run right over you.

301
00:16:44,020 --> 00:16:45,820
- Why would you do that?
- Hey, Dan.

302
00:16:46,260 --> 00:16:47,980
You got a really fat head.

303
00:16:49,020 --> 00:16:51,220
- Maybe it's your face.
- Yeah, it's hereditary.

304
00:16:51,340 --> 00:16:53,980
My mom has a fat face
and my dad has a fat head.

305
00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:57,300
You should see his mom's head.
It's huge.

306
00:16:58,900 --> 00:16:59,980
Can I help you?

307
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:04,380
Hi. I'm Greg Gatlin. I own
the new restaurant down the street.

308
00:17:04,460 --> 00:17:06,180
Good.
I missed the pizza.

309
00:17:06,340 --> 00:17:09,460
Well, now it's a tapas bar
called Get on Tapas.

310
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:11,740
I don't get it.

311
00:17:13,460 --> 00:17:14,540
Tapas bar.

312
00:17:16,340 --> 00:17:17,420
I don't get it.

313
00:17:18,420 --> 00:17:19,540
Tapas bar.

314
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:30,700
Anyway, I'm having a party
in a couple weeks. Hope you can come.

315
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:33,300
- I don't go to parties.
- Yeah, I don't think so.

316
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:36,140
- Free food and drinks.
- Why didn't you said so?

317
00:17:36,340 --> 00:17:38,340
- Welcome to the neighborhood.
- Thank you.

318
00:17:38,420 --> 00:17:41,500
- Yeah, good luck with the restaurant.
- You know that place is cursed, right?

319
00:17:42,180 --> 00:17:43,860
I'm gonna beat that curse...

320
00:17:44,020 --> 00:17:46,380
but I'll need you to
Get on Tapas.

321
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:04,380
It's a florist's secret that the
purple ones have the deepest scent.

322
00:18:04,620 --> 00:18:07,780
For the party, I'm gonna put one
on a hair comb for your girlfriend.

323
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:10,260
No girlfriend.

324
00:18:10,660 --> 00:18:11,820
I'm sorry.

325
00:18:12,740 --> 00:18:15,580
- She wasn't who I thought she was.
- Okay, well...

326
00:18:16,180 --> 00:18:19,020
owner of this new hot
Brooklyn restaurant...

327
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:20,700
you are gonna meet
somebody new.

328
00:18:21,940 --> 00:18:24,820
No, no, no.
I'm off relationships.

329
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:27,580
Fantastic.
You'll be so much happier.

330
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:32,980
Okay, you're not gonna say
that thing that women always say...

331
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:34,660
which is I haven't found
the right one yet?

332
00:18:34,820 --> 00:18:37,580
No. I don't believe
there's just one person.

333
00:18:38,860 --> 00:18:39,740
What?

334
00:18:39,820 --> 00:18:42,180
I don't believe people are meant
to be in relationships.

335
00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:44,980
- What?
- Yeah, we should just have fun.

336
00:18:45,020 --> 00:18:47,540
And when the romance is gone,
move on.

337
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:51,860
- Well, how long does that last?
- Five dates to be exact.

338
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:53,500
That is exact.

339
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:56,580
Five dates happens to be the perfect
amount of time...

340
00:18:56,660 --> 00:18:58,820
to achieve maximum fun
with no pain.

341
00:18:59,020 --> 00:19:01,380
No expectation equals
no disappointment.

342
00:19:01,460 --> 00:19:03,180
It's just fun,
and there are no rules.

343
00:19:04,780 --> 00:19:06,620
- No rules?
- No rules.

344
00:19:06,940 --> 00:19:10,060
And you know what? In relationships,
that's all there are.

345
00:19:10,380 --> 00:19:13,020
You know, one person wants more,
the other person wants less.

346
00:19:13,140 --> 00:19:15,660
And then they act out cheat,
come back, stay out of guilt...

347
00:19:15,740 --> 00:19:17,340
oops, now someone's pregnant,
all of a sudden...

348
00:19:17,420 --> 00:19:18,780
you're married
and hate each other.

349
00:19:20,740 --> 00:19:23,260
Dating is just
so much more romantic.

350
00:19:24,620 --> 00:19:27,260
So, you love romance
but not relationships?

351
00:19:27,460 --> 00:19:30,020
What's to love about something
that only brings unhappiness?

352
00:19:31,020 --> 00:19:32,820
It's just...
It's just not natural.

353
00:19:34,260 --> 00:19:35,980
Do you know any happy couples?

354
00:19:36,340 --> 00:19:37,980
All the time?
No, but...

355
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:40,620
I am happy all the time.

356
00:19:41,460 --> 00:19:43,980
That's hot.
Is she hot?

357
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:46,620
Doesn't matter.
Her attitude is hot.

358
00:19:46,820 --> 00:19:50,380
She could have three eyes,
two butts and a tooth and I'd do her.

359
00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:52,940
Hey, does this tie say
"My client's guilty"?

360
00:19:53,020 --> 00:19:53,940
She's just...

361
00:19:54,020 --> 00:19:56,780
Hey, when was the last time
you had a good pastrami sandwich?

362
00:19:56,860 --> 00:20:01,020
New cafeteria girl has a sexy
thin eyebrows thing going on.

363
00:20:01,260 --> 00:20:03,060
All right, I'm gonna ask her out.

364
00:20:03,540 --> 00:20:06,540
You lucky moron, she just wants
to have sex with you.

365
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:08,780
What?
Don't be ridiculous.

366
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:12,500
Dude, trust me.
Chicks love an assertive guy.

367
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:15,100
Come on, try it for once.

368
00:20:25,060 --> 00:20:26,460
I wanna have sex with you.

369
00:20:33,420 --> 00:20:34,300
Greg...

370
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:36,940
just because I don't believe
in relationships...

371
00:20:37,020 --> 00:20:38,500
does not mean that I'm easy.

372
00:20:38,980 --> 00:20:42,420
If you are interested in spending
some time with me, you may romance me.

373
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:43,380
Got it?

374
00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:44,660
Okay.

375
00:20:47,060 --> 00:20:47,980
Sorry.

376
00:20:48,820 --> 00:20:49,740
It's okay.

377
00:20:50,380 --> 00:20:54,540
Now... it just so happens,
I am open for wooing.

378
00:20:54,780 --> 00:20:56,620
Okay. What do I do?

379
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:00,100
Well, anything.

380
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:03,020
Women appreciate any gesture
of romance.

381
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:05,060
I'm not a romantic.

382
00:21:05,380 --> 00:21:07,780
You broke into your ex's apartment
with roses.

383
00:21:08,020 --> 00:21:09,860
I caught her in bed.

384
00:21:10,580 --> 00:21:11,540
You did?

385
00:21:15,220 --> 00:21:16,700
That was my fault.
I'm sorry.

386
00:21:16,780 --> 00:21:18,260
- Back to this.
- Okay.

387
00:21:19,420 --> 00:21:21,820
Just put some effort into it.

388
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:24,300
Women like to be pursued.

389
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:28,300
I've been flown to Hawaii,
I've had my name peed in the snow.

390
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:31,180
It all counts.

391
00:21:33,260 --> 00:21:34,180
Okay.

392
00:21:35,820 --> 00:21:39,180
How about rent a billboard
that says, "Let's bone"?

393
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:41,860
Or "You got nice hair".

394
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:44,260
Look, I am intrigued by
this theory of hers.

395
00:21:44,340 --> 00:21:46,380
My instincts are messed up and...

396
00:21:46,860 --> 00:21:50,380
stat-wise my dump ratio
is off the charts lately.

397
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:52,580
Lately?
No, you've always gotten burned.

398
00:21:52,700 --> 00:21:56,020
Remember in law school that chick
who dumped you by fax?

399
00:21:56,420 --> 00:21:58,620
Or the one who ditched you
for a party clown?

400
00:21:58,740 --> 00:22:02,220
- That's why I hate clowns.
- I like balloon animals.

401
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:03,780
Especially giraffes.

402
00:22:06,620 --> 00:22:09,020
Hey, but with this chick,
you can't get dumped.

403
00:22:12,940 --> 00:22:15,020
You're so right.
That's the beauty of it.

404
00:22:15,220 --> 00:22:18,020
We're both agreeing to end it
after five dates.

405
00:22:18,220 --> 00:22:19,260
I think I'm gonna try this...

406
00:22:19,340 --> 00:22:21,820
see if I can come out without
the usual intestine-twisting pain.

407
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:24,620
What, am I boring you?
I sound like I'm on Oprah's couch?

408
00:22:24,820 --> 00:22:26,580
Man, Oprah is hot.

409
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:37,460
- Oops.
- Uh-oh.

410
00:22:38,460 --> 00:22:39,340
Here you go.

411
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:51,540
Hello.

412
00:22:56,260 --> 00:22:57,580
- Hi.
- Hey.

413
00:22:58,940 --> 00:23:01,140
Don't you guys have something
to do in the back?

414
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:04,180
No.

415
00:23:05,900 --> 00:23:09,660
Could you take these to that place
that ordered them that day...

416
00:23:09,740 --> 00:23:11,820
when they called on the phone
to ask about them?

417
00:23:17,180 --> 00:23:18,180
Thank you.

418
00:23:30,780 --> 00:23:32,780
I have not asked you out.

419
00:23:33,980 --> 00:23:35,700
But I'm working on it.

420
00:23:36,060 --> 00:23:39,180
I'm just stumped by
the whole romance thing...

421
00:23:39,540 --> 00:23:41,300
the gesture to woo you with.

422
00:23:42,860 --> 00:23:45,220
Jewelry, a stuffed animal.

423
00:23:45,620 --> 00:23:47,780
I mean, I just, you know, a bird?

424
00:23:48,980 --> 00:23:50,500
I don't know what
I'm supposed to do.

425
00:23:52,180 --> 00:23:54,860
Well, you're not
"supposed" to do...

426
00:23:55,380 --> 00:23:56,260
anything.

427
00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:01,900
You know what, forget it.
It's okay.

428
00:24:02,180 --> 00:24:05,940
Obviously this is just causing you
stress and... Let's be friends.

429
00:24:22,580 --> 00:24:24,060
Hey, what's that?

430
00:24:24,260 --> 00:24:25,460
- No, no, hey...
- Hey, wait a minute. No, don't.

431
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:28,660
It's got my name on it!
Let me see.

432
00:24:29,060 --> 00:24:31,180
"Roses are red, violets are blue.

433
00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:34,620
Will you be my date for my restaurant
opening? I hope you do."

434
00:24:34,980 --> 00:24:35,940
There you go!

435
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:44,140
- To Get on Tapas!
- To Get on Tapas!

436
00:24:44,620 --> 00:24:46,180
- Congratulations.
- Thanks.

437
00:24:46,260 --> 00:24:47,980
I can't believe I did it.

438
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:51,820
I'm really glad you're here.

439
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:54,140
To our first date.

440
00:24:58,420 --> 00:25:01,580
- Is this an okay first date?
- Yes, it's perfect.

441
00:25:01,660 --> 00:25:02,540
Okay.

442
00:25:02,660 --> 00:25:05,100
Because Date Number One
is a new beginning.

443
00:25:05,260 --> 00:25:07,820
Well, this place is going to take up
a lot of my time, so...

444
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:11,660
I'll have to take it slow with us.
Is there a time frame?

445
00:25:12,340 --> 00:25:13,220
No.

446
00:25:13,780 --> 00:25:14,700
Okay.

447
00:25:15,780 --> 00:25:19,820
What a dump! I'm just joking.
Nice place. When you closing?

448
00:25:21,300 --> 00:25:23,140
Best burrito bar I've ever seen.

449
00:25:23,220 --> 00:25:25,260
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Cal, this is Genevieve...

450
00:25:25,580 --> 00:25:27,660
- the girl I told you about.
- When?

451
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:29,900
Five dates.

452
00:25:30,540 --> 00:25:33,900
Hello.
I'm Cal, short for Callous.

453
00:25:35,220 --> 00:25:38,100
On behalf of men everywhere,
I would just like to say thank you.

454
00:25:38,580 --> 00:25:42,380
You should teach a course to all
the crazy, clingy broads that I've...

455
00:25:42,460 --> 00:25:45,020
hey, this is ping.

456
00:25:48,300 --> 00:25:49,620
Is this your adopted daughter?

457
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:52,660
She's my date.

458
00:25:54,100 --> 00:25:56,100
Good, someone's choking.

459
00:25:57,860 --> 00:25:58,660
Behave.

460
00:25:58,740 --> 00:26:01,100
Dude, is there a club of them?
Are there others here?

461
00:26:02,420 --> 00:26:04,180
Get ping a drink.

462
00:26:05,780 --> 00:26:06,700
There you go.

463
00:26:10,180 --> 00:26:11,740
Sorry about Cal.

464
00:26:13,660 --> 00:26:16,580
- He's harmless.
- Yeah. If you're vaccinated.

465
00:26:18,820 --> 00:26:20,180
Hey, I...

466
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:22,420
I saw this and thought of you.

467
00:26:26,260 --> 00:26:27,140
I love it!

468
00:26:28,660 --> 00:26:29,980
Yeah, Spanish flowers.

469
00:26:30,660 --> 00:26:32,660
It's really thoughtful.
Thank you.

470
00:26:33,020 --> 00:26:36,340
God! For a while there,
it was gonna be a scented candle.

471
00:26:36,820 --> 00:26:38,380
That would have been nice, too.

472
00:26:39,060 --> 00:26:40,940
What about... notepaper?

473
00:26:41,380 --> 00:26:42,740
- Lovely.
- Scarf?

474
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:44,740
- Yes.
- Antique stool?

475
00:26:46,140 --> 00:26:47,860
- Creepy.
- Really?

476
00:26:48,060 --> 00:26:48,940
Yeah.

477
00:26:50,940 --> 00:26:53,180
I'm not really a fan
of antiques.

478
00:26:53,780 --> 00:26:54,860
You know, they...

479
00:26:55,180 --> 00:26:58,220
I can kind of only see the person
who once had it, you know...

480
00:26:58,340 --> 00:27:00,660
like their, their dead hand
clutching it.

481
00:27:01,140 --> 00:27:02,060
You know?

482
00:27:03,540 --> 00:27:04,580
Good to know.

483
00:27:05,140 --> 00:27:07,900
Other stuff: Jazz makes me nervous
and nauseas...

484
00:27:08,140 --> 00:27:10,460
and one sleeve dresses,
they're just wrong.

485
00:27:10,740 --> 00:27:12,900
I'm hot,
no this arm's cold.

486
00:27:13,540 --> 00:27:14,420
Got it.

487
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:15,580
Okay.

488
00:27:16,420 --> 00:27:17,940
And what are your fears?

489
00:27:19,380 --> 00:27:20,700
Opening a restaurant.

490
00:27:24,180 --> 00:27:25,700
How are reservations?

491
00:27:28,460 --> 00:27:31,260
A few people have called.
For pizza.

492
00:27:36,020 --> 00:27:37,380
You smell nice.

493
00:27:39,300 --> 00:27:41,020
This is the good part.

494
00:27:41,780 --> 00:27:42,740
What?

495
00:27:43,460 --> 00:27:44,980
The anticipation.

496
00:27:59,340 --> 00:28:00,980
<i>So thanks for taking
the day off work.</i>

497
00:28:01,100 --> 00:28:03,140
<i>An art gallery opening,
what a great idea!</i>

498
00:28:03,220 --> 00:28:06,140
Yeah? Good, good, because you said
our second date should be...

499
00:28:06,220 --> 00:28:09,260
theatrical or cultural,
so I thought of this, or...

500
00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:10,740
maybe a concert.

501
00:28:11,860 --> 00:28:13,900
Okay, I don't know what you're thinking
to do about for music...

502
00:28:13,980 --> 00:28:19,300
for your restaurant, but I saw this band
at a wedding I did last year...

503
00:28:19,380 --> 00:28:21,260
and they can play anything.

504
00:28:23,380 --> 00:28:25,460
That's, that's so thoughtful of you.

505
00:28:28,060 --> 00:28:29,300
"Exhalations".

506
00:28:46,980 --> 00:28:49,260
It's called "Manifest Destiny.

507
00:29:08,740 --> 00:29:10,380
It's called "Train Tracks".

508
00:29:13,260 --> 00:29:14,540
Isn't it beautiful?

509
00:29:18,780 --> 00:29:20,660
Two thousand dollars.

510
00:29:20,860 --> 00:29:23,460
What?
Let me see that.

511
00:29:32,820 --> 00:29:35,260
This one's called
"I Hate Grandma".

512
00:29:36,660 --> 00:29:37,740
For real?

513
00:29:38,740 --> 00:29:39,740
No.

514
00:29:40,340 --> 00:29:41,540
What's it called?

515
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:45,780
"Yellow dot".

516
00:29:49,740 --> 00:29:51,260
I don't see it.

517
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:13,020
I'm so glad you didn't like it.

518
00:30:13,100 --> 00:30:15,180
I'm so glad you didn't like it,
either.

519
00:30:17,300 --> 00:30:18,860
Now, on Date Number Two...

520
00:30:18,940 --> 00:30:22,460
we do the requisite trading
of familial background information.

521
00:30:23,500 --> 00:30:25,860
A sister, two parents, all close.

522
00:30:26,020 --> 00:30:29,060
Okay, no siblings, parents divorced,
not close to my father.

523
00:30:29,380 --> 00:30:30,380
Why not?

524
00:30:31,140 --> 00:30:34,380
- My dad cheated.
- That must've been hard.

525
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:36,620
Well, I plan to get over it one day.

526
00:30:36,860 --> 00:30:40,500
Yeah, yeah, it's good to let that
seething anger fester for a long time.

527
00:30:42,900 --> 00:30:47,180
Well, changing the subject,
you owe me something private back.

528
00:30:48,940 --> 00:30:52,260
Jeez.
One time, I heard my parents.

529
00:30:52,340 --> 00:30:54,020
- No, no.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

530
00:30:54,100 --> 00:30:56,700
Couldn't look them in the eye
until I was in college.

531
00:30:56,780 --> 00:30:58,220
"Hey, Mom, Dad."

532
00:31:01,220 --> 00:31:02,420
Weird.

533
00:31:05,780 --> 00:31:08,500
- This is a fun date.
- You like my system, huh?

534
00:31:08,660 --> 00:31:11,660
Yeah, so far so good.
I mean, no expectations...

535
00:31:11,780 --> 00:31:15,940
or wondering if the other person
is looking for some kind of commitment.

536
00:31:20,020 --> 00:31:22,500
- No worrying about the first kiss.
- Yeah, that's over.

537
00:31:30,780 --> 00:31:31,780
I'm...

538
00:31:33,780 --> 00:31:36,900
I'm not really good with the public
display of affection kind of thing.

539
00:31:37,060 --> 00:31:38,700
Okay. Okay.

540
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:06,380
Go, go, go back to the part
about the kissing.

541
00:32:06,460 --> 00:32:07,340
Yeah, the part about the kissing.

542
00:32:07,420 --> 00:32:09,860
- Wait, when's the next date?
- Yeah, when's the next date?

543
00:32:09,940 --> 00:32:10,900
In eight days.

544
00:32:10,940 --> 00:32:12,780
I told him Date Number Three
should be an adventure.

545
00:32:12,860 --> 00:32:15,340
- I can't wait.
- I can't wait.

546
00:32:21,340 --> 00:32:23,060
Cal recommended this place.

547
00:32:23,540 --> 00:32:27,340
Okay, this sake is called Nigori
and it's very unique.

548
00:32:27,820 --> 00:32:30,540
Later we're gonna try Junmai,
which is very pure.

549
00:32:30,700 --> 00:32:31,580
Okay.

550
00:32:31,660 --> 00:32:34,220
But here's the adventure...
a sake bomb!

551
00:32:35,700 --> 00:32:36,940
Okay.

552
00:32:37,460 --> 00:32:39,180
All right!

553
00:32:39,260 --> 00:32:43,420
It's time for Kamikaze Karaoke!

554
00:32:46,420 --> 00:32:49,820
Where I put the songs,
nobody knows!

555
00:32:51,140 --> 00:32:53,540
All right, our first...

556
00:32:53,780 --> 00:32:55,140
player is...

557
00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:57,860
seat number six.

558
00:32:58,220 --> 00:33:01,620
Look under your chair
for your number.

559
00:33:01,940 --> 00:33:02,900
Seat six.

560
00:33:04,180 --> 00:33:06,580
- That's me!
- Come on down! Come on!

561
00:33:06,620 --> 00:33:08,060
Come on, hurry up!

562
00:33:10,460 --> 00:33:12,860
That's my number!
What's my song?

563
00:33:12,980 --> 00:33:16,220
You are singing
"polly Wolly Doodle".

564
00:33:16,300 --> 00:33:19,540
- I don't know the words.
- That's why it's...

565
00:33:19,620 --> 00:33:22,140
Kamikaze Karaoke!

566
00:33:26,580 --> 00:33:27,660
Did you know about this?

567
00:33:28,660 --> 00:33:29,580
No.

568
00:33:30,460 --> 00:33:31,820
<i>I went down south</i>

569
00:33:31,860 --> 00:33:35,220
<i>For to see my Sal Sing
Polly Wolly Doodle all the day</i>

570
00:33:38,460 --> 00:33:40,220
That was great, that was great!

571
00:33:40,380 --> 00:33:42,820
Despite what everyone thinks,
that was fantastic.

572
00:33:42,900 --> 00:33:45,740
<i>Nobody knows</i>

573
00:33:45,980 --> 00:33:49,420
<i>The trouble I have seen</i>

574
00:33:49,780 --> 00:33:51,340
<i>Glory</i>

575
00:33:51,420 --> 00:33:54,780
<i>Hallelujah</i>

576
00:33:57,060 --> 00:33:58,780
All right, that was wonderful.

577
00:33:58,900 --> 00:34:01,580
I don't know what song that was,
but that was fantastic.

578
00:34:01,700 --> 00:34:04,260
Go head, have a seat.
Sorry, your time onstage is done.

579
00:34:04,340 --> 00:34:05,740
Thank you very much, sir.

580
00:34:05,900 --> 00:34:08,940
Okay.
Next up seat number...

581
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:11,460
thirty-three.
Thirty-three?

582
00:34:13,860 --> 00:34:16,460
Thirty-three?
Come on, don't be shy!

583
00:34:17,100 --> 00:34:18,580
Thirty-three!

584
00:34:18,860 --> 00:34:23,700
- Thirty-three!
- Thirty-three!

585
00:34:23,940 --> 00:34:24,900
Genevieve.

586
00:34:24,980 --> 00:34:28,700
- Thirty-three!
- Thirty-three!

587
00:34:28,980 --> 00:34:29,980
Then go!

588
00:34:31,140 --> 00:34:32,380
No way.

589
00:34:33,180 --> 00:34:34,140
Go!

590
00:34:34,220 --> 00:34:38,580
- Thirty-three!
- Thirty-three!

591
00:34:38,820 --> 00:34:39,780
That's me!

592
00:34:40,180 --> 00:34:41,820
All right!

593
00:34:45,620 --> 00:34:46,980
All right, there you go.

594
00:34:47,060 --> 00:34:49,460
Hi. Okay, you have...

595
00:34:49,700 --> 00:34:52,780
"There's No Livin'
Without Your Lovin"'.

596
00:34:52,980 --> 00:34:54,420
- Okay.
- All right.

597
00:34:54,540 --> 00:34:55,540
Thank you.

598
00:34:56,980 --> 00:35:00,940
<i>If I can't love you</i>

599
00:35:01,100 --> 00:35:04,300
<i>Till the day I die</i>

600
00:35:04,460 --> 00:35:07,820
<i>Then baby, oh baby</i>

601
00:35:07,900 --> 00:35:10,340
<i>What good am I?</i>

602
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:14,780
<i>If I can't reach out
And know that you'll be there</i>

603
00:35:14,940 --> 00:35:19,220
<i>Then this old world
Ain't spinning anywhere</i>

604
00:35:19,420 --> 00:35:23,980
<i>And there's no livin'
Without your loving</i>

605
00:35:25,140 --> 00:35:26,380
And the fellow!

606
00:35:27,740 --> 00:35:28,780
You can do it!

607
00:35:29,420 --> 00:35:30,380
Something!

608
00:35:36,100 --> 00:35:37,340
Come on!

609
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:42,060
You suck!
You suck!

610
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:46,700
You suck!
You suck!

611
00:35:46,900 --> 00:35:48,140
Enough abuse for you.

612
00:35:48,260 --> 00:35:50,660
Come on down there, missy.
That was fantastic.

613
00:35:50,780 --> 00:35:53,660
All right.
Big round of applause.

614
00:35:54,100 --> 00:35:55,860
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

615
00:35:57,260 --> 00:35:58,660
- Should we go?
- No.

616
00:35:58,860 --> 00:36:02,340
No, I could never get up there.
It's too public.

617
00:36:03,180 --> 00:36:04,820
But that's what's fun
about karaoke.

618
00:36:05,020 --> 00:36:07,100
I couldn't get up there.

619
00:36:08,260 --> 00:36:11,380
- So you do have a fear.
- No. No fear, just a choice.

620
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:14,740
A choice not to act like an idiot
and do something stupid.

621
00:36:15,020 --> 00:36:19,660
<i>Buffalo gals, can you come out tonight
Can you come out tonight</i>

622
00:36:19,700 --> 00:36:22,540
I don't know, I think sometimes
it's fun to do something stupid.

623
00:36:22,620 --> 00:36:23,580
That's 'cause you're fun.

624
00:36:23,660 --> 00:36:27,780
You're easygoing and nothing fazes you
and there's no pretense.

625
00:36:29,860 --> 00:36:30,860
You're blushing.

626
00:36:31,540 --> 00:36:32,460
I am?

627
00:36:34,100 --> 00:36:34,980
Yeah.

628
00:36:38,540 --> 00:36:39,620
Should we order?

629
00:36:40,620 --> 00:36:44,660
Yeah. See if they have
public humiliation on the menu.

630
00:36:45,060 --> 00:36:47,460
They do.
I just had it as an appetizer.

631
00:36:53,940 --> 00:36:55,220
<i>I think it's interesting.</i>

632
00:36:55,340 --> 00:36:58,660
These southern gentlemen,
they're not loud and show-offy like us.

633
00:36:58,780 --> 00:37:01,740
You know, he's a gentleman.
He doesn't do stupid things.

634
00:37:02,340 --> 00:37:03,780
He's different.

635
00:37:04,740 --> 00:37:06,980
I don't know,
she's just so alive, so...

636
00:37:07,700 --> 00:37:08,740
fearless.

637
00:37:09,580 --> 00:37:12,420
- And the best part? No rules.
- Yeah, well, that's different.

638
00:37:12,700 --> 00:37:14,740
- She is different.
- Who?

639
00:37:15,220 --> 00:37:16,140
Dinner.

640
00:37:18,420 --> 00:37:19,980
Why are we friends?

641
00:37:20,180 --> 00:37:22,740
Hello, canoe tip?
I saved your life at summer camp.

642
00:37:22,900 --> 00:37:25,060
No, no, no.
I saved your life, pal.

643
00:37:25,300 --> 00:37:27,340
And I've been loyal to you
ever since.

644
00:37:28,180 --> 00:37:30,660
- Here comes Genevieve.
- Who's that?

645
00:37:31,060 --> 00:37:34,260
I gotta get to court.
Thanks for the nachos.

646
00:37:34,900 --> 00:37:35,860
Hello.

647
00:37:36,180 --> 00:37:38,220
- Hi.
- So I was thinking...

648
00:37:38,420 --> 00:37:42,060
why not get a stellar review and
make your place the talk of the town?

649
00:37:43,980 --> 00:37:45,420
- It's that easy?
- Yeah.

650
00:37:47,460 --> 00:37:49,260
Well, I'm not ready.

651
00:37:49,340 --> 00:37:51,260
The menu is still in transition.

652
00:37:51,500 --> 00:37:54,620
- It's just a little neighborhood joint.
- Really? Well, I thought you'd say that.

653
00:37:54,740 --> 00:37:57,300
So I told him what a nice,
hardworking guy you are...

654
00:37:57,380 --> 00:38:00,220
and that opening a restaurant
is this huge big change in your life...

655
00:38:00,340 --> 00:38:03,100
and he said when you're ready for
a review, you just call the paper, okay?

656
00:38:05,860 --> 00:38:08,020
- You called the critic?
- Yeah.

657
00:38:11,780 --> 00:38:12,660
Thank you.

658
00:38:13,300 --> 00:38:14,300
You're welcome.

659
00:38:19,540 --> 00:38:20,660
Well, I should go.

660
00:38:22,340 --> 00:38:23,300
Okay.

661
00:38:41,940 --> 00:38:42,900
Happy.

662
00:38:44,060 --> 00:38:45,740
You think so?
I'd say unhappy.

663
00:38:45,980 --> 00:38:47,780
What looks unhappy about him?

664
00:38:47,860 --> 00:38:50,700
Stooped shoulders, big sigher.
Watch.

665
00:38:51,300 --> 00:38:52,540
Wait for it.

666
00:38:57,940 --> 00:38:59,940
- You're good.
- I have a gift.

667
00:39:00,020 --> 00:39:01,380
- Yeah, all right.
- Watch.

668
00:39:02,260 --> 00:39:03,980
Pretty upbeat guy.

669
00:39:04,940 --> 00:39:07,820
- Worried about office politics.
- Is that right?

670
00:39:09,860 --> 00:39:11,860
Pretty upbeat gal.

671
00:39:12,500 --> 00:39:13,980
Worried about...

672
00:39:15,460 --> 00:39:18,180
- nothing?
- I told you, happy all the time.

673
00:39:19,300 --> 00:39:23,500
Or just doesn't think about things
that make her unhappy.

674
00:39:26,660 --> 00:39:28,260
Look at that old lady.

675
00:39:31,180 --> 00:39:32,540
- Happy.
- Yeah.

676
00:39:46,540 --> 00:39:49,420
- Hey, Tim, can I ask you a question?
- Keep it clean.

677
00:39:50,420 --> 00:39:53,020
Genevieve's really not
into commitment?

678
00:39:53,540 --> 00:39:55,940
No.
No, just fun.

679
00:39:57,300 --> 00:39:59,740
What do you think about
this five dates theory?

680
00:40:00,180 --> 00:40:04,060
I got a wife, two kids,
two mortgages, nosy in-laws...

681
00:40:04,180 --> 00:40:07,940
a dog that humps my La-Z-Boy,
and no peace.

682
00:40:08,180 --> 00:40:09,740
I think she's a genius.

683
00:40:10,100 --> 00:40:11,820
She makes me feel like...

684
00:40:13,460 --> 00:40:15,500
it's hard to explain,
but like I can do no wrong.

685
00:40:15,660 --> 00:40:17,900
I'm planning dates,
I'm buying little gifts.

686
00:40:18,020 --> 00:40:19,700
That's not me, but I like it.

687
00:40:19,860 --> 00:40:22,540
So I wanna do something
really special for her.

688
00:40:23,420 --> 00:40:24,820
What do you have in mind?

689
00:40:40,180 --> 00:40:41,220
From Greg.

690
00:40:56,780 --> 00:41:00,660
"In my fantasy, you're wearing
these with nothing but a smile."

691
00:41:00,740 --> 00:41:01,620
My!

692
00:41:01,700 --> 00:41:03,540
- Let me see.
- Gimme! Gimme!

693
00:41:03,820 --> 00:41:04,980
No!

694
00:41:05,460 --> 00:41:06,860
<i>I don't think so!</i>

695
00:41:07,060 --> 00:41:08,580
<i>It's mine.</i>

696
00:41:11,140 --> 00:41:14,500
I'll be honest. I don't know
if I can beat that restaurant's curse.

697
00:41:16,300 --> 00:41:17,420
You will.

698
00:41:23,540 --> 00:41:24,580
This is pretty.

699
00:41:26,700 --> 00:41:27,700
Antique.

700
00:41:35,860 --> 00:41:37,420
Thanks for making dinner.

701
00:41:38,700 --> 00:41:40,900
You said it would make
a great fourth date.

702
00:41:41,220 --> 00:41:42,660
Thanks for listening.

703
00:41:47,620 --> 00:41:50,060
To our fourth date
in three months.

704
00:41:50,140 --> 00:41:51,020
Yeah.

705
00:41:55,500 --> 00:41:56,900
You know, for me...

706
00:41:57,180 --> 00:42:00,500
romances are usually
this fast whirlwind...

707
00:42:00,620 --> 00:42:01,860
and I...

708
00:42:06,220 --> 00:42:10,060
I've just really enjoyed taking
the time to get to know you.

709
00:42:10,260 --> 00:42:11,580
Yeah, me too.

710
00:42:16,660 --> 00:42:19,660
- So what's this now?
- Marinated peppers.

711
00:42:20,020 --> 00:42:20,940
That's hot.

712
00:42:25,060 --> 00:42:26,180
How hot?

713
00:43:12,940 --> 00:43:14,860
This is the most fun
I've ever had.

714
00:43:19,940 --> 00:43:21,020
Me too.

715
00:43:31,140 --> 00:43:34,860
Great. Now I gotta get one of these
for my wife for Mother's Day.

716
00:43:35,180 --> 00:43:37,940
Good morning, beautiful boys!

717
00:43:38,740 --> 00:43:41,180
Your skin is very clear.

718
00:43:41,300 --> 00:43:43,580
Your eyes are so white.

719
00:43:44,860 --> 00:43:46,340
They did it!
They did it!

720
00:43:46,660 --> 00:43:49,700
They did it!
They did it! They did it!

721
00:43:52,180 --> 00:43:54,660
Hey, this is none
of your business.

722
00:43:55,340 --> 00:43:58,380
- But we're so proud of you!
- Deets. I need details.

723
00:43:59,100 --> 00:44:02,100
I would never. I'm a lady.
Please!

724
00:44:03,380 --> 00:44:04,300
Okay.

725
00:44:04,900 --> 00:44:06,700
Then we won't ask you about it.

726
00:44:07,380 --> 00:44:08,620
- Good.
- Fine.

727
00:44:10,500 --> 00:44:11,460
Super fine.

728
00:44:15,100 --> 00:44:16,780
I have mail to open.

729
00:44:17,500 --> 00:44:20,140
Tim, orchids
for the Mother's Day rush?

730
00:44:20,300 --> 00:44:21,220
Friday.

731
00:44:22,740 --> 00:44:24,300
How are my eyebrows?

732
00:44:24,980 --> 00:44:27,620
Very Gwen Stefani
during pregnancy.

733
00:44:31,700 --> 00:44:33,740
- He cooked for me.
- Go on, go on.

734
00:44:33,860 --> 00:44:36,700
- I slept over for two nights.
- Go on!

735
00:44:37,700 --> 00:44:39,620
- So this is date number four?
- Yeah.

736
00:44:39,700 --> 00:44:41,660
- And there's one more date after this?
- Yes.

737
00:44:41,740 --> 00:44:43,500
And after date number five,
it's over?

738
00:44:45,940 --> 00:44:46,820
Yes.

739
00:44:48,180 --> 00:44:49,540
You seem different.

740
00:44:52,700 --> 00:44:54,180
- How?
- I don't know.

741
00:45:10,460 --> 00:45:11,340
Hi.

742
00:45:12,340 --> 00:45:13,900
What are we doing?

743
00:45:14,940 --> 00:45:16,340
Can you see Greg?

744
00:45:20,340 --> 00:45:21,380
- Yeah.
- Okay.

745
00:45:21,660 --> 00:45:24,620
Does he look sick
or injured or on fire?

746
00:45:29,140 --> 00:45:30,060
No.

747
00:45:31,860 --> 00:45:33,460
It's been four days?

748
00:45:33,940 --> 00:45:34,820
Yeah.

749
00:45:36,780 --> 00:45:37,780
Four days.

750
00:45:39,380 --> 00:45:42,220
- Why hasn't he called me?
- He'll call.

751
00:45:42,420 --> 00:45:44,780
So look.
It's crazy.

752
00:45:45,620 --> 00:45:47,220
Looks like a reborn...

753
00:45:47,620 --> 00:45:48,500
- Hey.
- Hello.

754
00:45:50,220 --> 00:45:53,260
What'll it be today, Genevieve?
Pears and Brie?

755
00:45:54,140 --> 00:45:56,140
Pate and celery sticks?

756
00:45:56,340 --> 00:45:57,900
I'll have a meatball sandwich.

757
00:45:59,580 --> 00:46:01,060
He hasn't called yet, huh?

758
00:46:10,540 --> 00:46:11,420
How are you?

759
00:46:13,100 --> 00:46:13,980
Good.

760
00:46:14,620 --> 00:46:15,500
Good.

761
00:46:19,020 --> 00:46:19,940
How are you?

762
00:46:20,780 --> 00:46:21,660
Good.

763
00:46:22,460 --> 00:46:23,380
Good.

764
00:46:25,620 --> 00:46:26,580
How are you?

765
00:46:27,780 --> 00:46:29,260
- Good.
- Good.

766
00:46:29,500 --> 00:46:30,980
- Good.
- Good.

767
00:46:32,540 --> 00:46:33,420
How are you?

768
00:46:34,580 --> 00:46:35,540
Good.

769
00:46:37,780 --> 00:46:38,780
Good, good.

770
00:46:47,860 --> 00:46:49,380
That's on the house.

771
00:46:50,620 --> 00:46:52,340
Genevieve. To go.

772
00:47:06,300 --> 00:47:08,420
- What's going on?
- Pardon?

773
00:47:08,580 --> 00:47:10,620
- You didn't call.
- What do you mean?

774
00:47:10,700 --> 00:47:13,220
What do you think,
you can just have your way with me?

775
00:47:13,300 --> 00:47:15,340
- But you said...
- What? What did I say?

776
00:47:15,420 --> 00:47:18,820
Five dates. Then move on.
No anger, no recriminations...

777
00:47:18,900 --> 00:47:21,580
- no commitments.
- Right. We had four dates.

778
00:47:21,620 --> 00:47:23,340
Four?
No, five.

779
00:47:24,700 --> 00:47:25,900
What are you talking about?

780
00:47:26,020 --> 00:47:28,780
Restaurant opening, Date One.
Art gallery, Two.

781
00:47:28,820 --> 00:47:31,820
Karaoke, Date Three.
Dinner at my place, Date Four.

782
00:47:31,900 --> 00:47:34,060
Then, you stayed over that night
and the next...

783
00:47:34,100 --> 00:47:37,820
so I thought that whole next day
and night was the five dates.

784
00:47:41,580 --> 00:47:43,380
Yeah, I'm just kidding.

785
00:47:46,100 --> 00:47:47,020
You are?

786
00:47:47,340 --> 00:47:48,940
I'm joking.

787
00:47:50,140 --> 00:47:52,060
Yeah, that makes five dates.

788
00:47:52,620 --> 00:47:56,220
- It was a lovely love affair.
- Yeah, it was great. I'd like to...

789
00:47:56,340 --> 00:47:58,420
But the romance is gone,
so we must move on.

790
00:47:58,500 --> 00:47:59,820
- I know, but do we have to move on...
- Yes.

791
00:47:59,900 --> 00:48:03,300
Anymore dates would be a relationship
and those do not work.

792
00:48:03,540 --> 00:48:05,260
- I wanna...
- Okay. All right, see you.

793
00:48:05,380 --> 00:48:07,580
My God, my sandwich.
So hungry. Bye.

794
00:48:12,020 --> 00:48:14,500
When? When?
When is she coming back?

795
00:48:14,580 --> 00:48:15,940
Don't you work?

796
00:48:16,580 --> 00:48:17,500
Yes.

797
00:48:19,740 --> 00:48:21,220
Hi. Thanks for coming in.

798
00:48:22,380 --> 00:48:23,500
I heard.

799
00:48:24,060 --> 00:48:25,220
What happened?

800
00:48:25,300 --> 00:48:27,580
He thought we had five dates.

801
00:48:27,700 --> 00:48:30,940
Why on earth would he think
a sleepover equals another date?

802
00:48:31,100 --> 00:48:33,580
Maybe because it sort of does.

803
00:48:34,260 --> 00:48:35,460
Can you be quiet?

804
00:48:35,900 --> 00:48:38,580
But maybe it does
a little bit for boys, maybe?

805
00:48:42,220 --> 00:48:44,620
- Do you want another date?
- No.

806
00:48:45,020 --> 00:48:47,340
- But maybe you do.
- No.

807
00:48:47,500 --> 00:48:49,780
Yes. Maybe this could be
a relationship, maybe?

808
00:48:49,940 --> 00:48:51,100
No!

809
00:48:53,340 --> 00:48:54,260
Fine.

810
00:48:57,940 --> 00:48:59,700
And let's just be clear, okay?

811
00:48:59,940 --> 00:49:02,340
It was four dates.

812
00:49:03,700 --> 00:49:04,660
Five.

813
00:49:05,300 --> 00:49:06,220
Bye.

814
00:49:07,180 --> 00:49:08,340
Gotta go.

815
00:50:11,420 --> 00:50:14,140
- What's this place called?
- Get on Tapas.

816
00:50:15,420 --> 00:50:16,580
That's dirty!

817
00:50:22,420 --> 00:50:24,700
Stupid, stupid, stupid.

818
00:50:24,900 --> 00:50:26,140
What'd I do?

819
00:50:28,300 --> 00:50:29,300
I'm so sorry!

820
00:50:29,620 --> 00:50:31,500
I'm so sorry!
I'm so sorry!

821
00:50:31,700 --> 00:50:33,620
I'm so sorry!
I'm sorry!

822
00:50:39,740 --> 00:50:41,700
Yeah, no, no, no.

823
00:50:41,860 --> 00:50:44,140
I gotta...
Really, I gotta...

824
00:50:44,500 --> 00:50:46,820
- Really? Come on. Really?
- I think I'm catching something.

825
00:50:46,900 --> 00:50:48,460
You better watch it
or you will, too.

826
00:50:48,500 --> 00:50:51,780
Right. Hey, what happened to that one
you were "not dating?"

827
00:50:51,900 --> 00:50:54,700
- Five dates. It's over.
- Atta boy!

828
00:50:54,780 --> 00:50:58,180
- Yeah. Have fun, man.
- Let's roll. Who's first?

829
00:51:03,340 --> 00:51:05,300
Make that booty call.

830
00:51:05,620 --> 00:51:08,620
- It's complicated.
- No, honey. My bowels are complicated.

831
00:51:08,780 --> 00:51:10,940
Life is simple.
Call her.

832
00:51:13,140 --> 00:51:17,500
<i>If you knew a certain gesture,
like, say, calling...</i>

833
00:51:17,660 --> 00:51:21,260
would be considered "needy",
and therefore a turnoff...

834
00:51:21,540 --> 00:51:24,300
but you wanted to call,
and you felt...

835
00:51:24,620 --> 00:51:27,780
this call could be welcomed
this one time...

836
00:51:27,860 --> 00:51:31,740
if you were the one person who took
a chance to do something different...

837
00:51:32,460 --> 00:51:36,460
maybe even some
would call it romantic...

838
00:51:36,980 --> 00:51:39,700
like calling for another date...

839
00:51:39,860 --> 00:51:41,220
a date that...

840
00:51:41,460 --> 00:51:44,940
if someone were counting,
could be numbered above five...

841
00:51:45,060 --> 00:51:46,420
say six...

842
00:51:47,660 --> 00:51:50,700
do you think that
would be considered manly?

843
00:51:50,980 --> 00:51:53,820
No, it wouldn't.
It would be a pain in the ass.

844
00:51:57,820 --> 00:51:58,780
Thank you.

845
00:52:00,300 --> 00:52:02,020
One new message.

846
00:52:02,540 --> 00:52:05,740
<i>Hi, it's me, your dad.</i>

847
00:52:06,460 --> 00:52:08,940
<i>Well, I guess I missed you again.</i>

848
00:52:09,420 --> 00:52:13,300
<i>Maybe I have an old number
for you? Did I say it's me?</i>

849
00:52:14,900 --> 00:52:16,660
<i>Gimme a call sometime.</i>

850
00:52:28,820 --> 00:52:31,500
Happy birthday!

851
00:52:34,700 --> 00:52:35,740
Hi, Mom.

852
00:52:37,260 --> 00:52:39,140
This is delicious.

853
00:52:39,260 --> 00:52:41,420
I made it from a "Top Chef' recipe.

854
00:52:41,620 --> 00:52:44,780
It's called "Gateau". Now wouldn't you
think that's made from a cat's toe?

855
00:52:45,180 --> 00:52:47,500
But it's G, "gateau".

856
00:52:47,740 --> 00:52:49,900
It means cake in French.

857
00:52:51,260 --> 00:52:52,340
Genevieve?

858
00:52:53,340 --> 00:52:56,220
Your father said
you never call him.

859
00:52:58,860 --> 00:53:00,540
You talk to Dad?

860
00:53:01,500 --> 00:53:05,180
Of course! He was my life
for twenty-five years.

861
00:53:06,780 --> 00:53:08,820
Not the photo.
Okay.

862
00:53:11,060 --> 00:53:12,300
He had affairs.

863
00:53:28,260 --> 00:53:31,620
So, are you seeing anybody now,
Missus Gernier?

864
00:53:32,620 --> 00:53:34,500
- Please say you are.
- Yeah.

865
00:53:34,620 --> 00:53:35,540
Okay.

866
00:53:36,020 --> 00:53:38,460
I wouldn't know a thing
about dating.

867
00:53:38,660 --> 00:53:40,500
Ask Genevieve.
She's an expert on dating.

868
00:53:40,580 --> 00:53:41,460
Yeah.

869
00:53:42,900 --> 00:53:43,820
Okay.

870
00:53:43,860 --> 00:53:46,660
Hey, hey, wow,
we have to get to work.

871
00:53:46,820 --> 00:53:48,060
So, okay.

872
00:53:48,980 --> 00:53:51,500
Well, hey, you guys owe me forty bucks
for these cameras.

873
00:53:51,820 --> 00:53:54,140
- You gave it to me.
- No, I didn't. I said I'd...

874
00:53:54,260 --> 00:53:55,180
- Yeah, you did.
- I'm sorry, I didn't mean for that to...

875
00:53:55,820 --> 00:53:58,660
Thanks for coming by.
Mom, thanks for the cake.

876
00:53:58,740 --> 00:54:00,700
- Come on!
- Happy birthday, dear.

877
00:54:12,580 --> 00:54:13,460
Oops.

878
00:54:13,940 --> 00:54:14,860
Uh-oh.

879
00:54:21,820 --> 00:54:23,940
So now the restaurant
is a success?

880
00:54:25,220 --> 00:54:28,020
I told him about that reviewer,
and the band.

881
00:54:28,340 --> 00:54:29,860
Do you want to go inside?

882
00:54:30,220 --> 00:54:31,100
No!

883
00:54:31,180 --> 00:54:33,420
You could flirt with the band
in front of Greg.

884
00:54:33,460 --> 00:54:34,380
Okay.

885
00:54:34,860 --> 00:54:37,140
Do I have anything in my teeth?

886
00:54:39,540 --> 00:54:40,500
- No, you are okay.
- Really?

887
00:54:40,580 --> 00:54:41,460
Yeah.

888
00:54:41,580 --> 00:54:43,780
What about here?
Is it like the rings of Saturn?

889
00:54:43,900 --> 00:54:44,980
They're tight.

890
00:54:45,900 --> 00:54:47,380
Yeah, should I pull them up?

891
00:54:47,500 --> 00:54:49,340
- I think so.
- It's like they're...

892
00:54:51,580 --> 00:54:52,460
Genevieve!

893
00:54:53,940 --> 00:54:55,620
- Genevieve!
- What?

894
00:54:58,340 --> 00:54:59,220
No.

895
00:54:59,340 --> 00:55:02,140
I know. I'm so sorry.
Nobody saw.

896
00:55:02,260 --> 00:55:03,820
- Really?
- Yeah, I don't think so.

897
00:55:03,940 --> 00:55:06,420
Maybe a lot of people.
No, I don't think so.

898
00:55:07,140 --> 00:55:09,060
- I know what will cheer you up.
- What?

899
00:55:09,180 --> 00:55:13,300
There's a really, really cute guy
working at the second run movie theater.

900
00:55:13,460 --> 00:55:15,220
They always smell like dust.

901
00:55:15,380 --> 00:55:17,580
- Yeah, I love that.
- Okay, go flirt.

902
00:55:18,140 --> 00:55:20,540
- Don't scrapbook him.
- I'll try.

903
00:55:27,860 --> 00:55:29,580
<i>- Hi, Mom.
- What are you doing?</i>

904
00:55:29,700 --> 00:55:31,140
<i>- Nothing.
- Has he called?</i>

905
00:55:31,300 --> 00:55:33,100
<i>I think he's gonna call you.</i>

906
00:55:36,580 --> 00:55:39,180
<i>Pride, it ruins relationships.</i>

907
00:55:39,380 --> 00:55:41,180
- Look, we have to do something.
- Yeah, we do.

908
00:55:41,260 --> 00:55:43,020
Why can't she just admit
she wants another date?

909
00:55:43,100 --> 00:55:45,660
- Why can't he say it first?
- 'Cause guys don't do that.

910
00:55:45,740 --> 00:55:48,100
But that's the problem. We not only
have to figure out our own feelings...

911
00:55:48,180 --> 00:55:50,300
we have to tell you what's going on
in your tiny heads.

912
00:55:50,420 --> 00:55:52,860
No, no, we have to do everything!
We have to plan the date...

913
00:55:52,980 --> 00:55:55,140
have to make sure it's something
you've never done before...

914
00:55:55,220 --> 00:55:56,380
have to think of romantic gifts
for you...

915
00:55:56,460 --> 00:55:59,020
- There you go.
- We have to listen to you.

916
00:55:59,060 --> 00:56:01,900
"Please, tell me more about
how you're a mixed media artist...

917
00:56:01,940 --> 00:56:04,460
who used to work only exclusively
with 'found objects'...

918
00:56:04,540 --> 00:56:06,340
but now you work with cork."

919
00:56:08,460 --> 00:56:10,820
Look, Genevieve has been nothing
but kind to us, right?

920
00:56:10,940 --> 00:56:13,100
And she's always there to listen to us
and give us advice...

921
00:56:13,180 --> 00:56:14,620
whenever, and wherever,
we need it.

922
00:56:14,740 --> 00:56:17,340
- I would be lost without her.
- We would all be lost without her.

923
00:56:17,420 --> 00:56:19,420
You guys, before you met
Genevieve...

924
00:56:19,500 --> 00:56:22,180
had you ever kissed
anything not made of plastic?

925
00:56:23,740 --> 00:56:25,140
<i>- Four dates?
- Yes!</i>

926
00:56:33,540 --> 00:56:36,300
Shut it!
Shut it! Shut it!

927
00:56:36,780 --> 00:56:39,260
How's about you finish
what you started?

928
00:56:42,260 --> 00:56:43,380
- Yeah.
- Right?

929
00:56:50,740 --> 00:56:52,580
Hey, we got an invitation.

930
00:56:54,260 --> 00:56:56,940
"To all who made Get On Tapas
a success...

931
00:56:56,980 --> 00:57:00,260
please join us for a Spanish Feast
of the Assumption August fifteenth.

932
00:57:00,340 --> 00:57:02,220
See you there!
Greg Gatlin."

933
00:57:04,140 --> 00:57:08,300
Well, someone is making assumptions
we're all available August fifteenth.

934
00:57:09,260 --> 00:57:13,740
And making assumptions we care whether
his restaurant broke the stupid curse.

935
00:57:14,500 --> 00:57:17,140
He's not even Spanish.
Poser.

936
00:57:18,380 --> 00:57:19,420
We're going.

937
00:57:20,500 --> 00:57:21,580
Have a good time.

938
00:57:21,900 --> 00:57:24,460
We're all going.
You will wear a pretty dress.

939
00:57:24,580 --> 00:57:27,820
Plus lipstick. And I'm gonna wax
those eyebrows right now.

940
00:57:28,020 --> 00:57:29,540
Bill, get more glue sticks.

941
00:57:29,700 --> 00:57:32,460
Her legs are so hairy
it looks like she's wearing pants.

942
00:57:33,340 --> 00:57:35,300
Come here, Steve Carell's chest.

943
00:57:35,580 --> 00:57:36,460
No.

944
00:58:01,300 --> 00:58:03,020
Bartender, a drink for the lady.

945
00:58:03,740 --> 00:58:05,020
What's your plan?

946
00:58:05,420 --> 00:58:07,540
Okay, around ten o'clock, I...

947
00:58:08,940 --> 00:58:10,940
The stroke of midnight.

948
00:58:12,220 --> 00:58:14,740
Okay, at the stroke of midnight...

949
00:58:14,820 --> 00:58:17,580
I'm gonna present her
with these roses on this comb.

950
00:58:17,780 --> 00:58:19,500
Dude, did you make that yourself?

951
00:58:19,660 --> 00:58:22,260
Lose the comb.
Just give her roses.

952
00:58:23,740 --> 00:58:24,620
Okay.

953
00:58:25,180 --> 00:58:29,420
At the stroke of midnight, I'm going to
present her with some roses, no comb...

954
00:58:29,700 --> 00:58:31,300
and ask for the other date...

955
00:58:31,580 --> 00:58:33,780
which, depending on your interpretation
of five dates...

956
00:58:33,860 --> 00:58:35,220
'cause I do think
that I counted correctly...

957
00:58:35,300 --> 00:58:37,700
No, no, no!
Cut that last part.

958
00:58:38,860 --> 00:58:41,940
- Okay.
- Now make it right.

959
00:58:43,780 --> 00:58:45,220
Okay. Scatter.

960
00:58:51,540 --> 00:58:53,100
- Sorry.
- Hey...

961
00:58:53,740 --> 00:58:54,700
Ginger.

962
00:58:54,900 --> 00:58:57,420
- You changed your hair.
- What's going on?

963
00:58:57,620 --> 00:59:00,980
But you had your five dates.
You're done. My turn.

964
00:59:02,420 --> 00:59:03,980
Go get some air, all right?

965
00:59:04,300 --> 00:59:06,140
You had your five dates.

966
00:59:06,380 --> 00:59:09,660
You had your five dates
and you're done? I see.

967
00:59:09,980 --> 00:59:12,900
I see, so you just hand me off
to your shallow friend?

968
00:59:12,980 --> 00:59:14,820
You... you know
I didn't hand you off.

969
00:59:14,900 --> 00:59:17,500
- Still you are not a gentleman.
- What?

970
00:59:17,580 --> 00:59:20,740
- You suddenly decide four dates is five?
- It was five.

971
00:59:20,780 --> 00:59:22,980
No, a sleepover
doesn't count as a date!

972
00:59:23,140 --> 00:59:25,540
Sorry. I didn't read
your instruction manual.

973
00:59:25,900 --> 00:59:27,140
What does that mean?

974
00:59:27,340 --> 00:59:30,420
It means that you act like
you believe "c'est la vie"...

975
00:59:30,500 --> 00:59:34,540
"have fun, everyone, there are
no rules". But you are all rules.

976
00:59:34,580 --> 00:59:35,820
You control everything.

977
00:59:35,860 --> 00:59:39,500
Who will woo you, for exactly how long,
five dates, then good-bye.

978
00:59:39,940 --> 00:59:43,540
You entered this willingly and then
you blame me 'cause you can't count?

979
00:59:43,740 --> 00:59:46,860
I get it now.
I just figured it out.

980
00:59:47,820 --> 00:59:51,500
You are so scared of being hurt that
you pretend to have this philosophy...

981
00:59:51,540 --> 00:59:53,780
about relationships
not being normal.

982
00:59:53,980 --> 00:59:57,380
Your fear of intimacy is only matched
by your ridiculous fantasy life.

983
00:59:57,540 --> 01:00:00,860
You act like you live in the opening
credits of some French film.

984
01:00:00,980 --> 01:00:03,660
You control everything
so it doesn't turn into something real.

985
01:00:05,620 --> 01:00:07,420
I like French films.

986
01:00:08,260 --> 01:00:10,860
Well, they're not real.
Just like you.

987
01:00:15,020 --> 01:00:18,020
- Here he comes.
- Dude, now...

988
01:00:22,180 --> 01:00:23,740
You can catch them
on your tongue.

989
01:00:26,420 --> 01:00:27,340
Wanna go?

990
01:00:27,420 --> 01:00:28,540
- Yup. Yeah.
- Big time.

991
01:00:30,420 --> 01:00:31,380
No!

992
01:00:38,020 --> 01:00:40,660
Maybe you should go back
and talk to him.

993
01:00:41,140 --> 01:00:42,020
No...

994
01:00:42,340 --> 01:00:44,220
he hates me.

995
01:00:49,940 --> 01:00:51,620
I feel naked.

996
01:00:52,140 --> 01:00:55,060
I feel like Greg can see
right through me.

997
01:00:55,180 --> 01:00:58,220
So? Does being vulnerable
make you weak?

998
01:00:59,740 --> 01:01:01,580
It's so my mom.

999
01:01:05,020 --> 01:01:09,700
I never understood why my mom
let my dad see...

1000
01:01:10,140 --> 01:01:11,380
her pain.

1001
01:01:12,940 --> 01:01:14,940
I wanted her to act like...

1002
01:01:15,180 --> 01:01:18,860
"Well, you cheated, get out".

1003
01:01:19,820 --> 01:01:21,180
But she...

1004
01:01:22,060 --> 01:01:24,620
cried to him.

1005
01:01:28,380 --> 01:01:30,700
I remember when she found out.

1006
01:01:31,220 --> 01:01:33,740
She sat down
at the kitchen table...

1007
01:01:37,380 --> 01:01:39,220
and her eyes
went back and forth...

1008
01:01:39,300 --> 01:01:42,020
as if she was trying to add
something in her head.

1009
01:01:46,140 --> 01:01:47,740
And then he left.

1010
01:01:50,940 --> 01:01:54,060
And you decided no one would ever
make you feel that way.

1011
01:01:59,660 --> 01:02:00,540
Well...

1012
01:02:02,900 --> 01:02:03,980
it's over.

1013
01:02:11,820 --> 01:02:12,740
It's over.

1014
01:02:14,180 --> 01:02:17,060
That's no fair.
I wasn't looking. Do-over.

1015
01:02:17,500 --> 01:02:18,380
Get up.

1016
01:02:18,980 --> 01:02:20,820
No. I'm good.

1017
01:02:35,860 --> 01:02:39,220
- You dodged a bullet, buddy.
- No, I didn't.

1018
01:02:39,980 --> 01:02:41,500
No, you didn't.

1019
01:02:58,460 --> 01:03:02,620
I'd love to go on a date with you.
I'll be back at the shop in 5 minutes.

1020
01:03:13,980 --> 01:03:17,260
<i>Yo, everybody,
it's ten minutes until midnight!</i>

1021
01:03:17,380 --> 01:03:19,660
<i>Hey, guys,
it's almost midnight!</i>

1022
01:03:21,740 --> 01:03:23,420
Cal says you like wine?

1023
01:03:24,660 --> 01:03:26,180
Do you have any Zinfandel?

1024
01:03:36,340 --> 01:03:37,420
Same thing.

1025
01:03:37,820 --> 01:03:40,100
A spritzer.

1026
01:03:42,060 --> 01:03:42,980
Yummy.

1027
01:03:43,420 --> 01:03:44,780
You're so inventive.

1028
01:03:45,420 --> 01:03:48,500
So anyway, my sister,
not the bipolar one, the other one...

1029
01:03:56,460 --> 01:03:58,900
- Hi.
- I'm seeing someone.

1030
01:04:01,100 --> 01:04:02,660
Boy, that's great.

1031
01:04:03,460 --> 01:04:04,620
Yeah, but it's new.

1032
01:04:05,580 --> 01:04:08,180
Do you have any love advice
for me?

1033
01:04:08,940 --> 01:04:12,180
Mom, I don't think
you want advice from me.

1034
01:04:12,620 --> 01:04:14,180
Shut up, it's time!

1035
01:04:14,220 --> 01:04:18,420
Five, four, three, two, one!

1036
01:04:18,580 --> 01:04:21,260
Happy New Year!

1037
01:04:27,660 --> 01:04:29,460
My eyes are bleeding!

1038
01:04:31,300 --> 01:04:32,180
Mom!

1039
01:04:32,620 --> 01:04:34,180
You're dating John?

1040
01:04:34,460 --> 01:04:37,380
Yeah, he's ten years
younger than me.

1041
01:04:38,220 --> 01:04:39,740
I'm a cougar!

1042
01:04:41,780 --> 01:04:43,180
<i>And I'm a young buck!</i>

1043
01:04:44,100 --> 01:04:45,700
- I forgot.
- Okay.

1044
01:04:45,860 --> 01:04:46,860
I made you...

1045
01:04:47,580 --> 01:04:49,860
a scrapbook of your life.

1046
01:04:50,140 --> 01:04:52,100
I askjeeved, googled...

1047
01:04:52,220 --> 01:04:54,900
and classmates. Commed you and...

1048
01:04:55,500 --> 01:04:59,220
there is a whole page of collage
of your lips.

1049
01:05:02,260 --> 01:05:03,300
I love it!

1050
01:05:03,980 --> 01:05:05,380
You're adorable.

1051
01:05:05,700 --> 01:05:09,060
And I got you this paperweight
that magnifies your baby picture.

1052
01:05:38,660 --> 01:05:39,860
- Oops.
- Uh-oh.

1053
01:05:40,780 --> 01:05:41,660
Oops.

1054
01:05:43,300 --> 01:05:44,180
Uh-oh.

1055
01:05:44,260 --> 01:05:46,220
- Table for one.
- Only the lonely.

1056
01:05:46,300 --> 01:05:48,500
- Serving only the lonely.
- It's lovely out here.

1057
01:05:48,580 --> 01:05:50,820
- It's chilly, isn't it?
- Do you know anyone we know out here?

1058
01:05:50,860 --> 01:05:53,460
- No. I used to.
- Who's that?

1059
01:05:54,060 --> 01:05:55,940
She looks like someone
we used to know.

1060
01:05:56,060 --> 01:05:59,860
She was the most romantic,
happy person who loved love.

1061
01:06:00,220 --> 01:06:02,380
Then she turned
into a shriveled twisted...

1062
01:06:02,460 --> 01:06:03,340
Stop.

1063
01:06:04,100 --> 01:06:05,420
I think...

1064
01:06:05,740 --> 01:06:09,060
you need to tell Greg
that you're scared.

1065
01:06:10,420 --> 01:06:13,500
You know, you think this is fear.

1066
01:06:13,780 --> 01:06:15,180
This is instinct.

1067
01:06:15,500 --> 01:06:18,780
Avoiding pain is how humans
have survived.

1068
01:06:19,020 --> 01:06:21,380
You think we'd still be here
if we didn't know...

1069
01:06:21,420 --> 01:06:24,980
"look, there's a saber-toothed tiger.
Let's run before it eats us"?

1070
01:06:25,580 --> 01:06:27,260
Honey, did you just see
your mom?

1071
01:06:27,340 --> 01:06:28,860
I did.

1072
01:06:29,900 --> 01:06:30,980
Let go.

1073
01:06:32,900 --> 01:06:34,340
Forgive the past.

1074
01:06:37,180 --> 01:06:40,180
- Hey. What is that? What are you doing?
- It's a moment.

1075
01:06:42,020 --> 01:06:43,900
Can we give you some advice?

1076
01:06:44,380 --> 01:06:45,340
No.

1077
01:06:49,500 --> 01:06:50,860
All right, bring it.

1078
01:06:51,940 --> 01:06:53,820
Woo him.

1079
01:07:11,260 --> 01:07:13,380
<i>You baked him muffins?</i>

1080
01:07:13,460 --> 01:07:16,780
<i>Isn't that a tiny bit
''think of me as your cousin Ethel"?</i>

1081
01:07:16,860 --> 01:07:19,900
Really? It took me all night
to think of that.

1082
01:07:19,980 --> 01:07:24,380
This is hard. What do guys like
besides pizza and morning sex?

1083
01:07:25,060 --> 01:07:27,580
Okay, I have to focus.
I have to focus.

1084
01:07:27,660 --> 01:07:30,860
I have to think, what does he want?
What does he want?

1085
01:07:30,940 --> 01:07:33,580
Because he will call me,
he will call me.

1086
01:07:33,740 --> 01:07:35,180
<i>He will call me.</i>

1087
01:07:38,860 --> 01:07:39,740
So...

1088
01:07:40,460 --> 01:07:42,580
he sent a thank you note?

1089
01:07:43,540 --> 01:07:44,900
Still no call?

1090
01:07:46,900 --> 01:07:50,180
What does this even mean?
What does it mean?

1091
01:07:50,380 --> 01:07:52,740
"Genevieve,
thank you for the gifts.

1092
01:07:53,020 --> 01:07:54,060
Grrrrrrreg."

1093
01:07:55,340 --> 01:07:57,060
I don't...
I don't know what else to do.

1094
01:07:57,140 --> 01:08:00,500
I've sent Rangers tickets
and chocolates and "Simpsons" DVDs.

1095
01:08:00,580 --> 01:08:02,660
I mean, I don't get it!
What do men want?

1096
01:08:02,700 --> 01:08:05,900
A cellulite seaweed wrap, a diamond
dog collar, and a karaoke machine.

1097
01:08:06,460 --> 01:08:08,140
Karaoke's a no.

1098
01:08:16,100 --> 01:08:18,820
- Can I cancel it?
- No. We'd be out of business.

1099
01:08:22,860 --> 01:08:24,300
It's gonna suck.

1100
01:08:24,540 --> 01:08:26,980
Yes, but it always does.

1101
01:08:33,260 --> 01:08:35,140
Roses For Whatever.

1102
01:08:37,340 --> 01:08:38,980
A thank you note?

1103
01:08:39,180 --> 01:08:42,060
She sent you all those gifts
and you didn't call?

1104
01:08:43,020 --> 01:08:44,180
I wanna call.

1105
01:08:45,660 --> 01:08:47,020
Am I an idiot?

1106
01:08:47,180 --> 01:08:49,100
In general?
I don't know.

1107
01:08:49,700 --> 01:08:52,940
Love makes you crazy.
You should call her.

1108
01:08:53,100 --> 01:08:56,420
I said horrible things to her.
What do I say now?

1109
01:08:56,940 --> 01:09:00,260
And the probability ratio of a failed
relationship working...

1110
01:09:00,340 --> 01:09:01,580
zero to none.

1111
01:09:02,740 --> 01:09:05,180
But this never was a relationship.

1112
01:09:58,860 --> 01:10:00,460
Come on!

1113
01:10:03,500 --> 01:10:04,900
Stupid fake holyday.

1114
01:10:05,020 --> 01:10:07,660
I know! It's just a day
of pressure, isn't it?

1115
01:10:07,700 --> 01:10:10,380
I mean, even if you're
in a relationship, which I'm not...

1116
01:10:10,420 --> 01:10:12,740
it's just a day that
makes you feel inadequate.

1117
01:10:12,780 --> 01:10:15,300
Am I doing enough for this person?
Did I get a big enough gift?

1118
01:10:15,340 --> 01:10:17,100
Do I even know this person?

1119
01:10:17,180 --> 01:10:19,500
And what about those candy hearts?
"Be Mine".

1120
01:10:19,540 --> 01:10:21,780
Like you gotta be somebody's
to matter, right?

1121
01:10:21,860 --> 01:10:24,620
I mean, I'm not anybody's now,
but I've been, before.

1122
01:10:31,820 --> 01:10:33,620
Chocolates for Genevieve!

1123
01:10:33,860 --> 01:10:35,780
Happy Valentine's Day!

1124
01:10:35,860 --> 01:10:39,740
John, it's a good day for you
because you're dating my mom.

1125
01:10:39,900 --> 01:10:42,660
A visual, that if I let it burn
through my retinas...

1126
01:10:42,700 --> 01:10:46,420
will seara hole through my skull
and my brain will leak onto my neck.

1127
01:10:46,540 --> 01:10:48,780
This is why you are happy
on this day.

1128
01:10:48,940 --> 01:10:51,820
I have seen this day for what it is,
a hollow sham.

1129
01:10:51,860 --> 01:10:55,020
I will sell many roses
to many fools on this day...

1130
01:10:55,100 --> 01:10:57,180
who have not seen the light
as I have.

1131
01:10:57,260 --> 01:10:59,940
Valentine's Day blows!

1132
01:11:08,300 --> 01:11:11,460
Don't get your hopes up today.
Some man will just crush 'em.

1133
01:11:16,100 --> 01:11:17,020
Mine!

1134
01:11:18,540 --> 01:11:20,820
Roses For Fooling Yourself
That Romance Exists.

1135
01:11:20,900 --> 01:11:23,100
- You want to work in the back today.
- May I help you?

1136
01:11:23,180 --> 01:11:25,620
- Okay, who was first?
- I was!

1137
01:11:35,620 --> 01:11:36,580
Tim.

1138
01:11:37,020 --> 01:11:39,220
Hey, what's up?

1139
01:11:39,500 --> 01:11:40,460
Tim...

1140
01:11:40,980 --> 01:11:44,540
I don't know anything about
anything anymore. What do I do?

1141
01:11:44,740 --> 01:11:48,460
How do I know? I'm from the world of
"Not tonight, the kid puked on me".

1142
01:11:48,500 --> 01:11:51,380
Yeah, but sometimes...

1143
01:11:51,580 --> 01:11:53,420
it's nice, right?

1144
01:11:58,660 --> 01:12:01,380
This morning, the kids were
running around like crazy...

1145
01:12:01,580 --> 01:12:04,580
Annie's standing in the kitchen
making pancakes.

1146
01:12:05,540 --> 01:12:07,340
Hair's all messed up...

1147
01:12:07,540 --> 01:12:10,980
her breath could've knocked
a buzzard off a portapotty and...

1148
01:12:13,340 --> 01:12:16,580
when she wasn't looking, I reached out
and took the pancake syrup and...

1149
01:12:16,620 --> 01:12:19,860
I spelled "Happy V-Day" out
on her plate.

1150
01:12:24,140 --> 01:12:25,740
She cried, you know?

1151
01:12:31,940 --> 01:12:33,700
Do I have it all wrong?

1152
01:12:35,140 --> 01:12:36,780
Is that what love is?

1153
01:12:39,980 --> 01:12:41,740
Well, you know, it's not...

1154
01:12:42,060 --> 01:12:44,580
butterflies in my tummy love,
you know...

1155
01:12:45,580 --> 01:12:48,700
but, you know, even on the bad days,
you get there...

1156
01:12:49,980 --> 01:12:51,940
you see her and the kids...

1157
01:12:52,700 --> 01:12:54,060
and yeah, think...

1158
01:12:54,780 --> 01:12:55,780
yeah...

1159
01:12:57,900 --> 01:12:59,500
it's good to be home.

1160
01:13:03,660 --> 01:13:05,820
Anyway, that's what love is to me.

1161
01:13:10,060 --> 01:13:10,980
Yeah.

1162
01:13:12,540 --> 01:13:13,540
Yeah.

1163
01:13:14,860 --> 01:13:16,780
Tell the boys I need to go.

1164
01:13:32,620 --> 01:13:33,580
Hi, Dad.

1165
01:13:36,140 --> 01:13:37,060
Genevieve.

1166
01:13:37,740 --> 01:13:39,660
Jeez, it's so good to see you.

1167
01:13:43,020 --> 01:13:44,100
How are you?

1168
01:13:47,820 --> 01:13:48,780
Dad...

1169
01:13:49,900 --> 01:13:52,180
you never should have
cheated on Mom.

1170
01:13:56,020 --> 01:13:57,060
Well...

1171
01:13:58,700 --> 01:14:02,060
I don't see how my relationship
with your mother concerns you.

1172
01:14:03,820 --> 01:14:06,420
Well, guess what?
It does.

1173
01:14:07,300 --> 01:14:09,060
It messed us all up.

1174
01:14:09,540 --> 01:14:12,140
It really hurt Mom, and...

1175
01:14:12,460 --> 01:14:15,380
how was I ever supposed
to trust a man after that?

1176
01:14:15,580 --> 01:14:17,060
It changed me.

1177
01:14:17,540 --> 01:14:19,740
It's taken me years
to figure this out.

1178
01:14:20,300 --> 01:14:24,140
I thought all I ever did
was fall in love...

1179
01:14:24,340 --> 01:14:27,700
but really,
I made sure I never did.

1180
01:14:31,100 --> 01:14:33,900
So, yeah it does concern me.

1181
01:14:33,940 --> 01:14:35,900
And you were wrong to do it.

1182
01:14:41,580 --> 01:14:42,860
But I love you.

1183
01:14:43,620 --> 01:14:44,500
Good-bye.

1184
01:15:02,860 --> 01:15:05,860
Boy, I can't wait to get home
to my old lady.

1185
01:15:06,260 --> 01:15:09,940
Did you get her a Valentine's card that
says, "Hey, old lady, glad you're alive"?

1186
01:15:11,020 --> 01:15:12,780
I meant my dog.

1187
01:15:13,140 --> 01:15:15,180
She's old and her name is Lady.

1188
01:15:16,940 --> 01:15:17,860
Sorry.

1189
01:15:21,380 --> 01:15:23,020
I like old things.

1190
01:15:23,340 --> 01:15:25,780
Lady was eleven
when I got her from the pound.

1191
01:15:28,740 --> 01:15:30,340
That antique stool?

1192
01:15:30,860 --> 01:15:33,780
I found that when I was in Kentucky
on the road.

1193
01:15:34,580 --> 01:15:36,100
It's almost two hundred years old.

1194
01:15:37,140 --> 01:15:39,460
Don't you find that kinda creepy?

1195
01:15:39,820 --> 01:15:42,460
Like you can still see
the old dead guy sitting on it?

1196
01:15:47,220 --> 01:15:48,580
Well, I do now.

1197
01:15:51,340 --> 01:15:52,380
Good talk.

1198
01:15:57,580 --> 01:15:59,140
Hey, you're out of T.p.

1199
01:15:59,540 --> 01:16:01,500
Any girls show up looking for me?

1200
01:16:01,580 --> 01:16:03,580
I hooked us up
with some paralegals.

1201
01:16:03,660 --> 01:16:06,180
You get Melissa, I get Doreen.
No, wait a minute.

1202
01:16:06,220 --> 01:16:09,580
Why do I stand here, with my hands
in my metaphorical pockets...

1203
01:16:09,700 --> 01:16:12,500
chained to my comfortable
spot of fear?

1204
01:16:15,620 --> 01:16:17,420
Are you rehearsing for a play?

1205
01:16:18,340 --> 01:16:20,220
No, man,
I'm talking about Genevieve.

1206
01:16:20,300 --> 01:16:21,260
Come on.

1207
01:16:23,380 --> 01:16:25,460
I miss her.
I want to see her again.

1208
01:16:27,060 --> 01:16:29,580
By summer,
I want to lose five pounds.

1209
01:16:30,820 --> 01:16:32,180
I blew it, man.

1210
01:16:32,620 --> 01:16:35,220
- I'm a complete moron.
- We're guys.

1211
01:16:35,420 --> 01:16:38,340
It's an accepted fact of our sex
that we do stupid stuff.

1212
01:16:43,620 --> 01:16:44,740
What'd you say?

1213
01:16:44,900 --> 01:16:46,740
I need to shed the lbs,
I'm getting chunky.

1214
01:16:46,860 --> 01:16:49,580
No, no, no, about guys
doing stupid stuff.

1215
01:16:49,740 --> 01:16:51,300
I don't know.
I don't listen.

1216
01:16:53,540 --> 01:16:55,300
Men do stupid things.

1217
01:16:55,620 --> 01:16:58,740
Yes, yeah. Think about it, I mean,
that's how great things happen.

1218
01:16:58,900 --> 01:17:00,340
Take the Wright Brothers.

1219
01:17:00,540 --> 01:17:04,060
What is smart about jumping off a cliff
strapped to wooden wings?

1220
01:17:04,300 --> 01:17:05,460
Wood is heavy.

1221
01:17:06,460 --> 01:17:09,300
That's it!
I gotta do something stupid.

1222
01:17:10,900 --> 01:17:12,420
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

1223
01:17:12,780 --> 01:17:14,660
- What's open?
- What's happening?

1224
01:17:29,620 --> 01:17:31,820
- May I borrow that?
- For two bucks you can own it.

1225
01:17:31,900 --> 01:17:34,100
- Deal.
- Plus a week's free tapas.

1226
01:17:34,220 --> 01:17:35,500
- Make it a month.
- Deal.

1227
01:17:35,580 --> 01:17:37,340
- Cal, get me some scissors.
- Cut that up.

1228
01:18:16,380 --> 01:18:17,980
I'm alive, okay?

1229
01:18:18,380 --> 01:18:20,900
<i>Yeah, but are you watching
"Jerry Maguire"again?</i>

1230
01:18:21,060 --> 01:18:22,420
No, I am not.

1231
01:18:22,900 --> 01:18:25,660
<i>Wait, is that jazz
outside your window?</i>

1232
01:18:27,460 --> 01:18:28,660
It is.

1233
01:18:29,100 --> 01:18:30,620
Yuck, jazz!

1234
01:18:39,140 --> 01:18:41,140
<i>- What are you doing?
- Genevieve!</i>

1235
01:18:42,820 --> 01:18:44,820
Here's stuff that scares you.

1236
01:18:46,060 --> 01:18:48,100
Here's something that scares me.

1237
01:18:50,220 --> 01:18:53,340
<i>If I can't love you</i>

1238
01:18:53,540 --> 01:18:55,340
<i>Till the day I die</i>

1239
01:18:56,380 --> 01:18:57,980
<i>Then maybe</i>

1240
01:18:58,220 --> 01:19:00,140
<i>Baby</i>

1241
01:19:00,380 --> 01:19:02,260
<i>What good am I?</i>

1242
01:19:02,820 --> 01:19:06,740
<i>If I can't reach out
And know that you'll be there</i>

1243
01:19:07,020 --> 01:19:10,580
<i>Then this whole world
Ain't spinning anywhere</i>

1244
01:19:11,260 --> 01:19:15,620
<i>'Cause there's no livin'
Without your lovin'</i>

1245
01:19:15,980 --> 01:19:19,780
<i>Without the thrill
Of your magic touch</i>

1246
01:19:19,980 --> 01:19:24,220
<i>There's no livin'
Without your lovin', baby...</i>

1247
01:19:24,620 --> 01:19:26,260
You're an idiot!

1248
01:19:26,420 --> 01:19:28,340
No, you are, but I love you!

1249
01:19:29,340 --> 01:19:31,580
Well, that makes you
a bigger idiot.

1250
01:19:33,140 --> 01:19:34,660
And I love you, too!

1251
01:19:36,180 --> 01:19:37,460
Now go away.

1252
01:19:37,940 --> 01:19:40,340
Okay, everybody, on three.

1253
01:19:40,620 --> 01:19:42,500
One, two...

1254
01:19:43,340 --> 01:19:44,300
three!

1255
01:19:50,580 --> 01:19:51,740
Genevieve...

1256
01:19:52,220 --> 01:19:54,660
will you be my Valentine?

1257
01:20:26,820 --> 01:20:29,420
- You're still an idiot.
- So are you.

1258
01:20:30,180 --> 01:20:33,260
Enough of your dumb system.
Are you my girlfriend?

1259
01:20:34,860 --> 01:20:35,780
Yeah.

1260
01:20:36,460 --> 01:20:39,340
I'm your girlfriend.
You're my boyfriend.

1261
01:20:40,700 --> 01:20:42,980
Some relationships work,
you know.

1262
01:20:43,020 --> 01:20:44,660
Look, I'm willing to try,
but I think we should set some rules...

1263
01:20:44,740 --> 01:20:45,860
because I don't know
what we're getting...

1264
01:20:45,940 --> 01:20:47,180
Stop talking.

1265
01:20:48,780 --> 01:20:49,780
Make me.
