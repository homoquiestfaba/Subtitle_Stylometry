1
00:00:15,128 --> 00:00:18,427
<i>In towns all across America,</i>
<i>you see pictures just like this.</i>

2
00:00:18,965 --> 00:00:21,593
<i>Young men taping their hands,</i>
<i>lacing up gloves...</i>

3
00:00:21,668 --> 00:00:23,363
<i>sweating in solitary confinement...</i>

4
00:00:23,437 --> 00:00:27,100
<i>beating on bags that accept</i>
<i>their punishment and never return fire.</i>

5
00:00:27,607 --> 00:00:30,576
<i>Within their minds, they begin to hear</i>
<i>the roar of the crowd...</i>

6
00:00:30,644 --> 00:00:34,876
<i>while daydreaming of the adulation,</i>
<i>the respect, the riches, the glory...</i>

7
00:00:34,948 --> 00:00:37,439
<i>that come with</i>
<i>being Champion of the World.</i>

8
00:00:37,684 --> 00:00:40,050
<i>This is a harmless moment</i>
<i>of make-believe...</i>

9
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:43,681
<i>culminating with a shower and then</i>
<i>a return to the local factory or mill...</i>

10
00:00:43,757 --> 00:00:45,850
<i>where another work shift awaits.</i>

11
00:00:45,926 --> 00:00:50,863
<i>But for some, however, the dream</i>
<i>is so strong, the allure so powerful...</i>

12
00:00:51,431 --> 00:00:55,367
<i>that a young man decides that</i>
<i>this will become more than a workout.</i>

13
00:00:55,435 --> 00:00:58,495
<i>And despite the odds,</i>
<i>he decides to take that leap...</i>

14
00:00:58,572 --> 00:01:03,236
<i>and throw punches that for mostly</i>
<i>are guaranteed to be returned.</i>

15
00:01:08,548 --> 00:01:11,745
<i>Charlie Davis decided</i>
<i>from an early age to take that leap.</i>

16
00:01:12,953 --> 00:01:16,047
<i>And for lack of a better plan,</i>
<i>or perhaps some crazy belief...</i>

17
00:01:16,123 --> 00:01:20,287
<i>that I was friends with a future champ,</i>
<i>I decided to tag along.</i>

18
00:01:21,895 --> 00:01:24,762
<i>Charlie had a knack</i>
<i>for knocking guys out.</i>

19
00:01:24,831 --> 00:01:28,392
<i>And I was there to help guide him</i>
<i>through the minefields.</i>

20
00:01:28,835 --> 00:01:31,303
<i>We were two kids</i>
<i>from Beaver Falls, PA...</i>

21
00:01:31,438 --> 00:01:35,704
<i>scrambling to find our way out</i>
<i>in a town where all roads pointed in.</i>

22
00:01:36,910 --> 00:01:39,572
<i>By now,</i>
<i>most of you that follow boxing...</i>

23
00:01:39,646 --> 00:01:43,013
<i>have heard about the legend</i>
<i>of Charlie "Kid" Davis.</i>

24
00:01:44,117 --> 00:01:48,247
<i>Around these parts he was known as</i>
<i>"The Boy Who Would Become King."</i>

25
00:01:49,423 --> 00:01:52,119
<i>But that's not exactly</i>
<i>the way it started out.</i>

26
00:01:55,862 --> 00:01:57,352
<i>Don't laugh.</i>

27
00:01:57,431 --> 00:02:00,958
<i>It was billed as the Western</i>
<i>Pennsylvania Tough Guy Tournament.</i>

28
00:02:01,201 --> 00:02:04,864
<i>Good prize money, a pay-per-view</i>
<i>event in our hometown.</i>

29
00:02:05,806 --> 00:02:08,866
<i>Charlie's folks had it on the screen</i>
<i>over at their bar.</i>

30
00:02:09,242 --> 00:02:11,642
<i>They weren't thrilled with this circus...</i>

31
00:02:11,845 --> 00:02:14,814
<i>but they didn't have</i>
<i>nothing better to offer.</i>

32
00:02:15,515 --> 00:02:19,178
<i>Besides, Charlie's dad, Gene,</i>
<i>had big problems of his own.</i>

33
00:02:21,188 --> 00:02:25,557
<i>Apparently, we didn't know</i>
<i>just how serious those problems were.</i>

34
00:02:29,129 --> 00:02:32,587
Don't worry about nothing.
I think you're wearing him out.

35
00:02:37,737 --> 00:02:39,671
It's been six weeks, Gene.

36
00:02:39,739 --> 00:02:42,765
My guy wants to know
how far do you test a friendship?

37
00:02:43,076 --> 00:02:47,479
I'll give him his cash, Willie. Bit by bit.
I'll give him all that's not tied down.

38
00:02:47,547 --> 00:02:49,139
I got to give him something, Gene.

39
00:02:49,216 --> 00:02:53,016
You keep making promises,
but they're starting to feel a bit empty.

40
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:55,620
I'll sign over the fucking lease.

41
00:02:55,689 --> 00:02:58,249
-He can have the joint.
-He don't want it, Gene.

42
00:02:58,325 --> 00:03:02,091
The beer's flat, the pipes leak,
the toilets don't flush.

43
00:03:02,162 --> 00:03:05,029
Burn it down.
The fucking cinders are worth more.

44
00:03:07,067 --> 00:03:09,467
Looks like Charlie's got his hands full.

45
00:03:09,536 --> 00:03:12,869
I told him not to do this.
He's fighting a fucking tent show freak!

46
00:03:12,939 --> 00:03:15,169
Who knows?
Maybe Charlie wears him down.

47
00:03:15,242 --> 00:03:18,177
Maybe the blimp can't go three rounds
without a meal.

48
00:03:18,245 --> 00:03:21,305
-You got a lot of unknowns here.
-Charlie's a boxer.

49
00:03:22,148 --> 00:03:26,585
-What has that got to do with this?
-What's it got to do with this?

50
00:03:28,121 --> 00:03:33,058
Let's make my night interesting, Geno.
I like the danger. I like that intrigue.

51
00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:37,219
How about I take Charlie, and you grab
hold of the fallout from Hiroshima?

52
00:03:37,464 --> 00:03:38,954
What are you saying?

53
00:03:39,132 --> 00:03:41,225
You want me to bet against my kid?

54
00:03:43,270 --> 00:03:47,138
Against someone, in favor of
someone else. Let's not get personal.

55
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:50,573
It takes the wind out of your balls,
you know what I mean?

56
00:03:50,644 --> 00:03:52,737
Separate yourself momentarily.

57
00:03:53,914 --> 00:03:57,247
Think clearly for a change.
You win, Geno...

58
00:03:57,317 --> 00:04:00,047
it buys you two weeks
with the old man off your back.

59
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:02,816
-I win....
-And what?

60
00:04:03,056 --> 00:04:07,288
You must come with your loose change
and hope the old man can't count.

61
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:15,267
-All right.
-You gonna take the pineapple?

62
00:04:20,740 --> 00:04:21,729
Yeah.

63
00:04:24,578 --> 00:04:28,446
Life, man. It never fails to amaze.

64
00:04:29,015 --> 00:04:31,643
Just when you think
a man's hit rock bottom...

65
00:04:31,851 --> 00:04:35,116
he finds another hole.
Ain't that right, Geno?

66
00:04:39,392 --> 00:04:42,725
I wouldn't let this
go to the judges, Charlie.

67
00:04:43,229 --> 00:04:44,628
You know what I'm saying?

68
00:04:44,698 --> 00:04:46,097
All right, here.

69
00:05:05,785 --> 00:05:09,050
Hey, Charlie! When he falls,
step the fuck out of the way!

70
00:05:11,157 --> 00:05:13,284
He's ready to go!

71
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:15,250
Timber!

72
00:05:16,363 --> 00:05:18,456
Be careful! It's a tsunami!

73
00:05:25,205 --> 00:05:29,539
We love you, Beaver Falls,
home of Charlie "Kid" Davis!

74
00:05:29,709 --> 00:05:31,574
Charlie!

75
00:05:36,516 --> 00:05:38,780
<i>We caught a ride home</i>
<i>with the big sumo.</i>

76
00:05:38,852 --> 00:05:42,413
<i>He seemed like a real interesting guy,</i>
<i>spoke five languages.</i>

77
00:05:42,622 --> 00:05:46,285
<i>Unfortunately, none of them</i>
<i>were English. So we just smiled a lot.</i>

78
00:05:46,359 --> 00:05:47,917
Thanks a lot, pal.

79
00:05:49,696 --> 00:05:51,129
He's a nice guy.

80
00:05:55,468 --> 00:05:57,459
What? What's the matter?

81
00:05:57,537 --> 00:06:00,529
I got to make a move, Tiny.
I can't do this no more.

82
00:06:01,574 --> 00:06:03,007
I don't know this?

83
00:06:03,343 --> 00:06:06,642
Eight years of Golden Gloves, of AAU
to end up dancing with...

84
00:06:06,713 --> 00:06:10,479
the night watchman from Manila,
and I got to hear this from you?

85
00:06:10,550 --> 00:06:12,142
I wanna be a champ.

86
00:06:12,719 --> 00:06:15,813
But it ain't gonna happen here.
Look around.

87
00:06:16,122 --> 00:06:18,522
Ain't nobody being crowned
in this town.

88
00:06:18,992 --> 00:06:23,554
Nevada, Charlie. But not the obvious.
I'm thinking Reno.

89
00:06:23,630 --> 00:06:25,063
It's wide open there now.

90
00:06:25,131 --> 00:06:27,190
The casinos are promoting cards
like crazy...

91
00:06:27,267 --> 00:06:28,894
and they got the money to back it up.

92
00:06:28,968 --> 00:06:31,937
Reno is the place. You go out there,
make a name for yourself...

93
00:06:32,005 --> 00:06:34,735
-Vegas comes calling.
-Why not Vegas first?

94
00:06:35,542 --> 00:06:37,510
I can't breathe in the fucking desert.

95
00:06:37,577 --> 00:06:40,478
They got fallout from
every nuclear test known to mankind.

96
00:06:40,547 --> 00:06:43,107
How can you train
in that kind of atmosphere?

97
00:06:43,917 --> 00:06:47,648
Reno, Charlie. You got opportunity
with a nice morning chill.

98
00:06:48,755 --> 00:06:52,851
You could be a champ in Vegas
and need a part-time job parking cars.

99
00:06:54,461 --> 00:06:57,862
Wherever I got to go, Tiny.
It don't matter at this point.

100
00:06:57,931 --> 00:07:00,331
If I stay here, I'm gonna starve.

101
00:07:00,567 --> 00:07:03,263
We'll make it
our Emerald City, Charlie.

102
00:07:04,404 --> 00:07:08,340
Someone will wave a magic wand
and the dust will turn into gold.

103
00:07:08,441 --> 00:07:09,772
I've done the homework.

104
00:07:09,843 --> 00:07:11,868
They've got a belt
waiting for you out there.

105
00:07:11,945 --> 00:07:14,675
A belt worth
more than this whole town combined.

106
00:07:15,915 --> 00:07:19,214
Sounds like a plan, huh?
Then let's go do it, come on.

107
00:07:20,153 --> 00:07:24,487
<i>When I saw the ambulance,</i>
<i>my mind immediately thought suicide.</i>

108
00:07:25,391 --> 00:07:30,351
<i>In this town, death by natural causes</i>
<i>don't solicit that quick a response.</i>

109
00:07:50,049 --> 00:07:52,540
<i>Charlie's dad was buried</i>
<i>a few days later.</i>

110
00:07:53,887 --> 00:07:58,153
<i>The gravediggers were on strike,</i>
<i>so we shovelled the dirt ourselves.</i>

111
00:07:59,626 --> 00:08:03,084
<i>Charlie told me</i>
<i>if he'd been home that night...</i>

112
00:08:03,363 --> 00:08:05,524
<i>his father might still be alive.</i>

113
00:08:06,733 --> 00:08:10,294
<i>I think Gene was dead</i>
<i>long before he ever pulled the trigger.</i>

114
00:08:11,704 --> 00:08:16,073
<i>In some sort of strange way,</i>
<i>he freed Charlie that night.</i>

115
00:08:17,844 --> 00:08:20,574
<i>What many people</i>
<i>would call an act of cowardice...</i>

116
00:08:20,647 --> 00:08:24,413
<i>was the final impetus Charlie needed</i>
<i>to head out and chase the dream.</i>

117
00:08:25,418 --> 00:08:28,512
<i>And somewhere deep down</i>
<i>in his tormented soul...</i>

118
00:08:29,455 --> 00:08:31,821
<i>I think his dad knew that, too.</i>

119
00:08:34,928 --> 00:08:38,159
You got enough sandwiches in here
to feed a small country.

120
00:08:38,898 --> 00:08:41,924
Make sure that Tiny knows
they're for the both of you.

121
00:08:42,068 --> 00:08:45,037
-Okay, Ma.
-Don't do no driving when you're tired.

122
00:08:45,104 --> 00:08:47,766
-It ain't a race to get there.
-I know.

123
00:08:48,341 --> 00:08:52,402
And call me when you get settled in.
Before that, too, if you get the urge.

124
00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:58,043
I wanna share this with you,
and I want Pop to see it happen, too.

125
00:08:58,685 --> 00:09:01,176
You don't owe me anything, Charlie.

126
00:09:01,921 --> 00:09:06,483
What you must do is answer the bell,
'cause it's ringing for you, Charlie.

127
00:09:10,396 --> 00:09:13,126
-You gonna be okay here?
-What choice do I have?

128
00:09:13,499 --> 00:09:16,127
It's not like they gave me
a whole bunch of options.

129
00:09:16,202 --> 00:09:18,102
I'm gonna make you proud, Ma.

130
00:09:18,404 --> 00:09:22,033
Believe me when I tell you
I'm gonna be a world champion.

131
00:09:23,276 --> 00:09:25,267
Answer the bell, Charlie.

132
00:09:25,411 --> 00:09:27,675
You're halfway there.
God gave you strength...

133
00:09:27,747 --> 00:09:31,183
and he gave you a heart.
Body and soul, Charlie.

134
00:09:31,251 --> 00:09:33,742
That's a tough combination to beat.

135
00:09:37,857 --> 00:09:40,621
-I'll tell him you're on your way.
-Okay.

136
00:09:48,301 --> 00:09:50,769
What's the matter, Tiny?
Can't wait to leave home?

137
00:09:50,837 --> 00:09:52,566
Just trying to get a jump on traffic.

138
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:55,870
I wouldn't worry about it.
After three blocks, the road's all yours.

139
00:09:55,942 --> 00:09:57,807
<i>I wasn't really worried</i>
<i>about the traffic.</i>

140
00:09:57,877 --> 00:10:01,040
<i>I wanted to get out of town before</i>
<i>someone checked their driveway...</i>

141
00:10:01,114 --> 00:10:03,344
<i>and noticed the car was missing.</i>

142
00:10:15,762 --> 00:10:18,731
-What's this?
-1965 Wildcat Convertible.

143
00:10:18,798 --> 00:10:20,322
-Where'd you get it?
-My uncle.

144
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:21,526
-What uncle?
-My Uncle Leo.

145
00:10:21,601 --> 00:10:23,330
-What Uncle Leo?
-On my mother's side.

146
00:10:23,403 --> 00:10:25,337
What do you care?
He lent me the car. Get in.

147
00:10:25,405 --> 00:10:27,305
He knows we're going to Reno?

148
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:28,737
Sure, whatever.

149
00:10:30,310 --> 00:10:33,768
Don't worry about nothing, Ma.
I'm gonna take good care of him.

150
00:10:34,681 --> 00:10:36,273
I know you will, Tiny.

151
00:10:42,855 --> 00:10:44,914
You take care of yourself.

152
00:10:56,336 --> 00:10:57,928
Okay, let's do it.

153
00:11:02,308 --> 00:11:03,798
Here we go. See you.

154
00:11:08,147 --> 00:11:09,512
<i>I talked a big game...</i>

155
00:11:09,582 --> 00:11:13,541
<i>but all I knew about Reno was that</i>
<i>Johnny Ticotin trained fighters there.</i>

156
00:11:13,853 --> 00:11:15,616
<i>Johnny was an old school guy.</i>

157
00:11:15,688 --> 00:11:19,920
<i>He crossed paths with the great ones,</i>
<i>and he wouldn't be easily impressed.</i>

158
00:11:20,059 --> 00:11:24,189
<i>I figured if Charlie caught his eye,</i>
<i>maybe we could be his last hurrah.</i>

159
00:11:24,964 --> 00:11:28,297
<i>And if not, well, I guess</i>
<i>I'd just move on to Plan "B."</i>

160
00:11:29,035 --> 00:11:30,559
<i>As soon as I thought of one.</i>

161
00:11:41,614 --> 00:11:43,775
<i>We'd left Beaver Falls with a plan.</i>

162
00:11:44,283 --> 00:11:47,309
<i>But it wasn't long before</i>
<i>Charlie decided we needed company.</i>

163
00:11:47,387 --> 00:11:49,287
<i>Like I wasn't company enough?</i>

164
00:11:49,722 --> 00:11:52,122
-Tiny, pull over.
-What for?

165
00:11:52,425 --> 00:11:55,019
-I'm getting us some company.
-What?

166
00:11:55,428 --> 00:11:56,986
Picking up chicks on the interstate?

167
00:11:57,063 --> 00:11:58,963
Haven't you ever seen
<i>America's Most Wanted?</i>

168
00:11:59,032 --> 00:12:02,058
We can end up on the side of the road
with our balls in our mouth.

169
00:12:02,135 --> 00:12:03,762
You should be so lucky.

170
00:12:04,904 --> 00:12:06,132
Thanks a lot.

171
00:12:12,612 --> 00:12:15,172
-So, where you headed?
-Away from here.

172
00:12:15,548 --> 00:12:16,947
<i>Her name was Gina.</i>

173
00:12:17,250 --> 00:12:21,186
<i>She had blue streaks in her hair,</i>
<i>and dark skeletons in her closet.</i>

174
00:12:21,587 --> 00:12:24,818
<i>The hair I could see,</i>
<i>the bones I could just feel.</i>

175
00:12:25,658 --> 00:12:28,855
<i>Believe me, she was</i>
<i>not part of my master plan.</i>

176
00:12:29,262 --> 00:12:33,756
<i>Gina had a frantic look in her eyes,</i>
<i>and very few other possessions.</i>

177
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:36,468
<i>The scent that I picked up on was...</i>

178
00:12:36,536 --> 00:12:40,370
<i>that she had just tunneled out</i>
<i>of some sort of miserable situation.</i>

179
00:12:40,807 --> 00:12:43,071
<i>The daylight seemed foreign to her...</i>

180
00:12:43,142 --> 00:12:46,202
<i>like a hostage whose blindfold</i>
<i>had just been removed.</i>

181
00:12:52,151 --> 00:12:56,520
Oh, boy. I haven't taken a dump
since Western Pennsylvania.

182
00:12:56,589 --> 00:12:59,854
This long-distance driving
can really throw off the system.

183
00:13:02,361 --> 00:13:04,955
So, what puts a girl like you
on the side of the road?

184
00:13:05,031 --> 00:13:08,194
-I don't know, fresh air.
-Sure. Why not?

185
00:13:08,434 --> 00:13:11,733
Any time I wanna smell the roses,
I just stroll along the interstate.

186
00:13:11,804 --> 00:13:14,034
Okay, then. So you understand.

187
00:13:15,141 --> 00:13:16,631
Where's your family?

188
00:13:17,844 --> 00:13:18,902
At home.

189
00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:23,947
Watching the news, doing the dishes,
walking the dog...

190
00:13:24,450 --> 00:13:27,248
getting up in the morning
and doing it all again.

191
00:13:28,287 --> 00:13:30,778
-Where's your family?
-My mom's back in Beaver Falls.

192
00:13:30,857 --> 00:13:33,223
We're headed for Reno.
I'm turning pro.

193
00:13:34,494 --> 00:13:37,725
-You're gonna be a hooker?
-Fighter. Prizefighter.

194
00:13:38,064 --> 00:13:40,931
-Are you any good?
-That's what I'm gonna find out.

195
00:13:43,436 --> 00:13:45,996
-And Costello, where does he fit in?
-Tiny.

196
00:13:46,105 --> 00:13:47,732
-Yeah, Tiny.
-He's with me.

197
00:13:47,807 --> 00:13:49,434
Is that a good thing?

198
00:13:50,543 --> 00:13:53,979
-I'm new to all this so--
-I'm new to all this, too.

199
00:13:55,948 --> 00:13:57,245
She chip in there, Charlie?

200
00:13:57,316 --> 00:14:00,217
She had coffee. What do you
want me to do, charge her?

201
00:14:00,286 --> 00:14:02,151
Coffee today, steak tomorrow.

202
00:14:02,221 --> 00:14:04,621
This kind of interference
we do not require, Charlie.

203
00:14:04,690 --> 00:14:07,215
We got a straight line here.
Already I feel you veering.

204
00:14:07,293 --> 00:14:10,558
You're worried about breaking rules
that ain't even been written yet.

205
00:14:10,630 --> 00:14:13,190
All right.
As long as we got a forum here.

206
00:14:13,266 --> 00:14:15,791
You know,
open lines moving in both directions.

207
00:14:15,868 --> 00:14:19,099
-We'll go like this for a while.
-We're fine, Tiny.

208
00:14:19,172 --> 00:14:20,867
Believe me when I tell you this.

209
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:23,238
That's one hell of an option I got there.

210
00:14:23,309 --> 00:14:25,106
Believe me when I tell you.

211
00:14:32,318 --> 00:14:36,379
<i>I thought we had made a mistake</i>
<i>picking her up in the first place.</i>

212
00:14:36,822 --> 00:14:39,655
<i>And yet,</i>
<i>here we were about to do it again.</i>

213
00:14:40,159 --> 00:14:44,459
<i>In my mind, the bottle of malt liquor</i>
<i>in her hand was not a good sign.</i>

214
00:14:45,264 --> 00:14:48,995
<i>For starters, it was 10:00 a.m.</i>
<i>And beer without a bag?</i>

215
00:14:49,769 --> 00:14:52,237
<i>That's a misdemeanor in my book.</i>

216
00:14:53,105 --> 00:14:54,902
You don't even know this girl.

217
00:14:54,974 --> 00:14:57,408
And it's not like
we need any social detours now.

218
00:14:57,476 --> 00:14:59,808
-We got an agenda here.
-What do you want me to do?

219
00:14:59,879 --> 00:15:02,973
-Leave her on the side of the road?
-This is just a lack of focus.

220
00:15:03,049 --> 00:15:04,983
I just want you to be aware of that.

221
00:15:05,051 --> 00:15:07,576
Hey, Gina.
We're all looking to start over.

222
00:15:07,787 --> 00:15:12,121
It's scary taking that leap.
No reason you should take it alone.

223
00:15:13,359 --> 00:15:15,520
Tiny says you need to stay focused.

224
00:15:15,962 --> 00:15:17,452
I think I am.

225
00:15:20,266 --> 00:15:22,200
Come on, get in.

226
00:15:26,839 --> 00:15:29,330
<i>I never doubted</i>
<i>she'd get back in the car.</i>

227
00:15:29,442 --> 00:15:32,343
<i>Charlie thought it was his charm,</i>
<i>but I knew better.</i>

228
00:15:32,979 --> 00:15:36,642
<i>If Gina wanted a ride,</i>
<i>she'd have to continue on with us.</i>

229
00:15:36,816 --> 00:15:40,183
<i>My instincts told me</i>
<i>we weren't in hitchhiker heaven.</i>

230
00:15:40,553 --> 00:15:43,147
<i>We were on the road</i>
<i>for another three days.</i>

231
00:15:43,356 --> 00:15:47,053
<i>One night we splurged</i>
<i>and shared a room in a fleabag motel.</i>

232
00:15:47,159 --> 00:15:50,617
<i>Gina snored like a truck driver</i>
<i>that night. I wanted to kill her.</i>

233
00:15:50,696 --> 00:15:53,358
<i>With her nostrils flared</i>
<i>and her mouth half open...</i>

234
00:15:53,432 --> 00:15:56,868
<i>she reminded me</i>
<i>of the great racehorse, Secretariat.</i>

235
00:15:56,936 --> 00:15:59,962
<i>Once that image came to me,</i>
<i>I decided to let her live.</i>

236
00:16:00,339 --> 00:16:02,569
<i>I always loved that horse.</i>

237
00:16:02,808 --> 00:16:04,935
Reno! Yes!

238
00:16:05,845 --> 00:16:09,975
<i>I surprised myself with the exuberance</i>
<i>I exhibited when we rolled into Reno.</i>

239
00:16:11,584 --> 00:16:15,748
<i>Later I found out it was an epileptic</i>
<i>response to all the flashing lights.</i>

240
00:16:15,821 --> 00:16:17,516
<i>Instead of looking for lodging...</i>

241
00:16:17,590 --> 00:16:20,115
<i>we headed</i>
<i>straight for Johnny Ticotin's gym.</i>

242
00:16:20,226 --> 00:16:22,888
<i>After all, we were here on business.</i>

243
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:29,630
This is it, Charlie.
This is where it all starts.

244
00:16:29,702 --> 00:16:31,135
Let's go say hello to Johnny.

245
00:16:31,203 --> 00:16:33,137
Tiny, don't we get to find a bed?

246
00:16:33,205 --> 00:16:35,139
We just drove across the world
to get here.

247
00:16:35,207 --> 00:16:37,437
I ain't worth a shit to no one
going in like this.

248
00:16:37,510 --> 00:16:40,536
Make yourself worth something.
This is what we came here to do.

249
00:16:40,613 --> 00:16:42,046
We ain't playing games no more.

250
00:16:42,114 --> 00:16:44,844
Picking up chicks on the highway
and pissing in the woods.

251
00:16:44,917 --> 00:16:46,043
This is business.

252
00:16:46,118 --> 00:16:49,610
Your father's dead in a barroom and
we're one step away from joining him.

253
00:16:49,689 --> 00:16:52,783
You wanna lay down and rest?
Fuck that! We came here to fight!

254
00:16:52,858 --> 00:16:55,418
I'm gonna go scout some rooms,
see what's available.

255
00:16:55,494 --> 00:16:58,190
Why don't you go do that?
We'll be one big, happy family...

256
00:16:58,264 --> 00:17:00,232
climbing the golden ladder together.

257
00:17:00,299 --> 00:17:02,529
Why don't you just jump right on in
and join us?

258
00:17:02,601 --> 00:17:04,660
No problem.
We've only been mapping this day...

259
00:17:04,737 --> 00:17:05,795
since fucking childhood.

260
00:17:05,871 --> 00:17:07,634
You ain't got to talk to her that way.

261
00:17:07,707 --> 00:17:09,470
Ain't nobody cutting you out.

262
00:17:09,542 --> 00:17:11,874
I ain't cutting nobody in, either.

263
00:17:12,578 --> 00:17:15,046
Is it that easy, Charlie?
Is that how it works?

264
00:17:15,114 --> 00:17:17,173
Come on,
not before we even get started.

265
00:17:17,249 --> 00:17:18,876
That ain't rational thinking.

266
00:17:18,951 --> 00:17:20,919
You wanna blow it up
before we even get hit?

267
00:17:20,986 --> 00:17:23,181
This ain't no lark.
It's no high-school joy ride.

268
00:17:23,255 --> 00:17:25,246
I know what I'm doing.
I'm doing the fighting.

269
00:17:25,324 --> 00:17:26,655
Then give yourself the shot.

270
00:17:26,726 --> 00:17:29,559
That's danger you're fooling with.
That's no stable influence.

271
00:17:29,628 --> 00:17:32,893
You're acting like a blind man
who's seen the sun for the first time.

272
00:17:32,965 --> 00:17:35,160
Let's me and you go inside.
Once we're in there...

273
00:17:35,234 --> 00:17:37,293
that's the only number that counts.

274
00:17:37,370 --> 00:17:38,803
All right.

275
00:17:38,871 --> 00:17:40,566
-You hear me?
-All right.

276
00:17:41,140 --> 00:17:43,040
All right, come on. Let's go.

277
00:17:45,077 --> 00:17:46,408
Hey, Johnny.

278
00:17:47,079 --> 00:17:48,774
Come on, I got a headache. What?

279
00:17:48,848 --> 00:17:51,214
Sorry, but there's someone here
I want you to meet.

280
00:17:51,283 --> 00:17:53,274
-Why?
-This is Charlie Davis...

281
00:17:53,352 --> 00:17:56,082
Golden Gloves,
AAU champ of Western PA.

282
00:17:56,155 --> 00:17:58,089
At $1.40, he hits like a mule.

283
00:17:58,157 --> 00:18:01,126
He's got the heart of a warrior, Johnny.
You can't teach that.

284
00:18:01,193 --> 00:18:04,060
If he's that good, why isn't he
fighting for the championship?

285
00:18:04,130 --> 00:18:06,598
-I need a trainer, Mr. Ticotin--
-Johnny's sufficient.

286
00:18:06,665 --> 00:18:09,190
I know what I can offer.
That's why we came out here.

287
00:18:09,268 --> 00:18:10,633
Nobody can do it alone.

288
00:18:10,703 --> 00:18:12,933
I don't know what to tell you.
I'm not a mechanic.

289
00:18:13,005 --> 00:18:15,473
I don't know.
You come in here, you light up a fire.

290
00:18:15,541 --> 00:18:18,942
Okay. If I feel the heat and I feel
something, maybe I can help.

291
00:18:19,011 --> 00:18:21,912
I know one thing: Nobody can win
without feeling something.

292
00:18:21,981 --> 00:18:23,107
Nobody.

293
00:18:23,182 --> 00:18:26,948
Maybe you watch Charlie work out,
and something catches your eye.

294
00:18:27,019 --> 00:18:28,714
-You got your gear?
-Sure.

295
00:18:30,556 --> 00:18:31,580
Yeah.

296
00:18:37,029 --> 00:18:40,294
Then let's go.
Three rounds with Lenny Turco.

297
00:18:40,366 --> 00:18:42,163
-Who's he?
-Who are you?

298
00:18:42,501 --> 00:18:44,935
I'm Tiny O'Toole.
I'm Charlie's manager.

299
00:18:45,104 --> 00:18:47,072
-You in the racket?
-Sure.

300
00:18:47,139 --> 00:18:49,073
-What's your first name?
-Tiny.

301
00:18:51,610 --> 00:18:54,306
Let me tell you
about Lenny Turco, all right?

302
00:18:54,380 --> 00:18:57,713
This guy is a professional opponent.

303
00:18:57,917 --> 00:19:00,784
He doesn't ask questions,
he doesn't complain...

304
00:19:00,853 --> 00:19:04,687
he's low-maintenance,
he's been around here forever...

305
00:19:04,757 --> 00:19:07,590
which is a lifetime longer
than he should've been.

306
00:19:07,726 --> 00:19:09,193
He looks like a light heavy.

307
00:19:09,261 --> 00:19:12,162
He's an opponent.
That's all you should worry about.

308
00:19:16,469 --> 00:19:18,437
Let me tell you something, all right?

309
00:19:18,504 --> 00:19:21,405
A good manager, you see,
is like a good kid.

310
00:19:22,208 --> 00:19:24,870
He's seen but he's not heard,
you understand?

311
00:19:24,944 --> 00:19:27,811
They don't....Wait a minute,
they don't pay to see us.

312
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:30,348
They pay to see the fighters,
the people in the ring.

313
00:19:30,416 --> 00:19:32,407
That's the show.
They pay to see them.

314
00:19:32,485 --> 00:19:35,181
And when they're beaten senseless
and bloody...

315
00:19:35,921 --> 00:19:38,185
they don't pay to see them anymore.

316
00:19:38,457 --> 00:19:39,719
You got that?

317
00:19:40,793 --> 00:19:41,885
Yeah, sure.

318
00:19:42,361 --> 00:19:44,556
Come here, Charlie, let me get that.

319
00:19:44,730 --> 00:19:46,891
Here you go. All right, go to work.

320
00:19:47,633 --> 00:19:49,601
Just so you know,
we just rolled into town.

321
00:19:49,668 --> 00:19:53,126
I want you to take that into account
in case Charlie isn't....

322
00:19:53,205 --> 00:19:55,298
You know....Whatever.

323
00:20:07,386 --> 00:20:08,978
There you go, Charlie!

324
00:20:09,588 --> 00:20:10,714
Finish it!

325
00:20:15,027 --> 00:20:16,517
That's in the gym, kid.

326
00:20:16,595 --> 00:20:20,691
Tell you what I saw.
The guy's young, fast...

327
00:20:20,766 --> 00:20:22,097
he hits hard...

328
00:20:22,768 --> 00:20:26,329
and the most important thing is,
he's White.

329
00:20:26,405 --> 00:20:29,238
That'll get him started
in the fight game.

330
00:20:30,342 --> 00:20:32,037
So you're gonna train him?

331
00:20:32,545 --> 00:20:35,480
Okay. There's something else
I wanna explain to you.

332
00:20:35,548 --> 00:20:38,278
See, this whole game, this whole thing
is a two-way street.

333
00:20:38,350 --> 00:20:40,284
And sooner or later,
it becomes congested.

334
00:20:40,352 --> 00:20:42,912
I don't know what deal you have
with him or he with you.

335
00:20:42,988 --> 00:20:44,478
I don't wanna know, you understand?

336
00:20:44,557 --> 00:20:48,118
I want you to understand something,
down the line, sooner or later...

337
00:20:48,193 --> 00:20:51,128
there are gonna be some people,
you understand, people...

338
00:20:51,196 --> 00:20:53,289
who won't be so understanding.

339
00:20:53,465 --> 00:20:55,763
We came to win, Johnny.
Nothing else matters.

340
00:20:55,834 --> 00:20:57,734
Ain't nothing wrong with that.

341
00:20:57,803 --> 00:21:00,601
Everybody wants to be a champion,
for God's sake.

342
00:21:00,973 --> 00:21:03,601
It's a dream,
and it helps you get up in the morning.

343
00:21:03,676 --> 00:21:06,702
-What's up, Tiny?
-We're in luck. Johnny will help us out.

344
00:21:06,779 --> 00:21:08,610
Great. When do we start?

345
00:21:08,681 --> 00:21:11,241
I'll tell you what.
Come around tomorrow morning...

346
00:21:11,317 --> 00:21:12,682
when you're settled in.

347
00:21:12,751 --> 00:21:14,844
There's another thing
I want to get clear here.

348
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:17,980
Most guys, they bring their fighters
along slow, you follow me?

349
00:21:18,057 --> 00:21:20,457
They don't wanna rush to the top.

350
00:21:20,793 --> 00:21:22,988
Not me. You see,
I show them what I got...

351
00:21:23,062 --> 00:21:25,530
and if they like what they got,
I double the stakes.

352
00:21:25,598 --> 00:21:28,328
I double the stakes
right then and there, you follow me?

353
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:33,269
If a thing opens up a good opportunity,
I get a shot, I grab it.

354
00:21:33,672 --> 00:21:38,609
Understand? There's no ifs, ands,
buts, whys, or because with Johnny.

355
00:21:38,744 --> 00:21:40,302
I like the sound of that.

356
00:21:40,379 --> 00:21:43,746
You save all your energy for the ring,
follow me?

357
00:21:43,816 --> 00:21:46,979
Don't waste any of it
on the outside world.

358
00:21:47,853 --> 00:21:51,619
You put your heart, you put your soul,
you put your dreams...

359
00:21:51,690 --> 00:21:56,093
you put everything
right here in the ring.

360
00:21:57,296 --> 00:21:59,355
-You got that?
-Yeah.

361
00:21:59,598 --> 00:22:03,932
<i>We got up early and started to run.</i>
<i>Charlie by the river, me, to a phone.</i>

362
00:22:04,003 --> 00:22:06,096
<i>We were short on cash,</i>
<i>so I called Uncle Leo...</i>

363
00:22:06,171 --> 00:22:08,036
<i>and offered to sell him back his car.</i>

364
00:22:08,107 --> 00:22:09,734
<i>He offered to break my legs.</i>

365
00:22:09,808 --> 00:22:11,366
<i>I respectfully declined.</i>

366
00:22:11,443 --> 00:22:15,106
I was talking to Johnny. He's thinking
about the undercard over at the Eldo.

367
00:22:15,180 --> 00:22:19,446
Four rounds, a good intro, meal
and rent money, and a leg in the door.

368
00:22:20,019 --> 00:22:23,352
I'm telling you, we stay on track,
we could be fighting every month.

369
00:22:23,422 --> 00:22:27,256
Be like a fucking freight train.
Ain't nobody gonna get in the way.

370
00:22:28,661 --> 00:22:31,459
I didn't see Gina this morning.
She say anything?

371
00:22:32,131 --> 00:22:34,395
Hello. Goodbye.
What's she gonna say?

372
00:22:34,833 --> 00:22:36,494
Come on, Charlie.

373
00:22:36,635 --> 00:22:39,502
Drop the fucking curtain.
Let this girl go.

374
00:22:39,605 --> 00:22:42,836
She don't know nothing about you,
about us, about herself.

375
00:22:43,876 --> 00:22:47,869
We're all doing our own little hustle,
but this girl can't keep time.

376
00:22:48,013 --> 00:22:50,174
What's scaring you, Tiny?

377
00:22:50,783 --> 00:22:54,048
She ain't no threat here.
Ain't nobody pushing you for the exit.

378
00:22:54,119 --> 00:22:57,179
Ain't nobody helping me
open the fucking doors, either.

379
00:22:57,256 --> 00:22:59,724
This ain't about how few limitations
we got here.

380
00:22:59,792 --> 00:23:02,590
It's more like,
"What are you doing to help?"

381
00:23:03,595 --> 00:23:07,031
-So, what's she doing, Charlie?
-She needed a ride, a place to stay.

382
00:23:07,099 --> 00:23:09,124
So we don't need to
discuss this further.

383
00:23:09,201 --> 00:23:13,604
We don't need to discuss nothing.
Why can't you feel good and let it be?

384
00:23:14,173 --> 00:23:17,768
Hey, look at me.
Who's to say I don't feel good?

385
00:23:24,983 --> 00:23:28,441
<i>Gina found a job serving drinks</i>
<i>at a local casino bar.</i>

386
00:23:28,687 --> 00:23:32,282
<i>I thought she'd have been better off</i>
<i>doing some exotic dancing.</i>

387
00:23:32,357 --> 00:23:34,791
<i>Good money, and a good sweat, too.</i>

388
00:23:39,465 --> 00:23:41,899
<i>Dumas was the town's</i>
<i>big fight promoter.</i>

389
00:23:41,967 --> 00:23:45,801
<i>He smelled Charlie's potential</i>
<i>early on. And he paid us a visit.</i>

390
00:23:47,506 --> 00:23:49,906
What do you think of our guy,
Mr. Dumas?

391
00:23:49,975 --> 00:23:52,239
Tiny O'Toole. A pleasure to know you.

392
00:23:54,046 --> 00:23:57,504
-I knew it would be a matter of time.
-You knew that?

393
00:23:57,583 --> 00:23:59,881
That's some gift you got there, kid.

394
00:23:59,952 --> 00:24:03,513
Tiny, he works with Charlie.
He kind of handles things.

395
00:24:03,589 --> 00:24:06,956
Whatever needs doing. I'm just here
to help push the cart along.

396
00:24:07,025 --> 00:24:08,492
Yeah, that's great.

397
00:24:08,594 --> 00:24:10,152
I got to tell you something.

398
00:24:10,229 --> 00:24:13,255
This kid does nothing but come
straight forward, straight ahead.

399
00:24:13,332 --> 00:24:16,927
And I ain't got nobody in this gym
that's gonna turn him around.

400
00:24:17,302 --> 00:24:19,463
We'll put him in that four-rounder.

401
00:24:19,671 --> 00:24:22,162
For now, it's a favor
'cause he's filling a void.

402
00:24:22,241 --> 00:24:26,405
After next week, when we see
how he does, we'll talk again.

403
00:24:26,712 --> 00:24:29,738
You're the guy to promote
Charlie's fights, Mr. Dumas.

404
00:24:29,815 --> 00:24:32,511
-We want to do business with you.
-Of course you do.

405
00:24:32,584 --> 00:24:34,882
In this town, you ain't got no choice.

406
00:24:35,254 --> 00:24:38,849
<i>I knew we'd hit it off,</i>
<i>and I couldn't wait to tell Charlie.</i>

407
00:24:40,092 --> 00:24:41,457
What drives you?

408
00:24:44,062 --> 00:24:48,658
I mean, what is it that makes you know
exactly what you want?

409
00:24:49,234 --> 00:24:50,633
Fear.

410
00:24:51,703 --> 00:24:54,001
I'm scared to death of standing still.

411
00:24:55,541 --> 00:24:56,735
That's why I fight.

412
00:24:56,809 --> 00:25:00,745
And the noise I hear
blocks out the silence.

413
00:25:03,582 --> 00:25:05,277
I can't face that, either.

414
00:25:05,617 --> 00:25:08,347
I'm fighting elements,
Gina, not people.

415
00:25:13,225 --> 00:25:14,920
You know what scares me?

416
00:25:19,498 --> 00:25:21,363
Coming here a stranger...

417
00:25:23,268 --> 00:25:24,633
with a stranger.

418
00:25:27,105 --> 00:25:30,268
Just floating through everything.

419
00:25:31,543 --> 00:25:36,037
Not being able to see through the fog.
I mean, none of this seems real.

420
00:25:38,784 --> 00:25:42,652
-And why don't I care?
-I care, Gina. Enough for both of us.

421
00:25:42,921 --> 00:25:45,651
Stay long enough for the fog to clear.

422
00:25:45,791 --> 00:25:49,750
And I'll guarantee you
you'll start to care, too. I promise you.

423
00:25:53,332 --> 00:25:56,768
-How can you be so sure?
-Because I don't have a choice.

424
00:26:01,573 --> 00:26:04,906
<i>That night Gina and Charlie</i>
<i>had a romantic evening alone.</i>

425
00:26:04,977 --> 00:26:08,572
<i>Me, I was out negotiating</i>
<i>tooth and nail to ensure...</i>

426
00:26:08,647 --> 00:26:12,378
<i>Charlie had proper dressing room</i>
<i>accommodations for his pro debut.</i>

427
00:26:13,285 --> 00:26:15,515
<i>I always look out for my guy.</i>

428
00:26:15,954 --> 00:26:18,184
You're using too much grease,
for Christ's sake.

429
00:26:18,257 --> 00:26:21,522
I know my guy. Ain't nothing
you could tell me about Charlie Davis.

430
00:26:21,593 --> 00:26:24,619
-I done everything but deliver this kid.
-Relax, Tiny.

431
00:26:24,696 --> 00:26:28,564
Charlie, you cut easily above the eye.
Nothing wrong with being safe.

432
00:26:28,634 --> 00:26:30,192
You listen to me, kid, all right?

433
00:26:30,269 --> 00:26:32,737
You go in, you go out,
and you don't fool around.

434
00:26:32,804 --> 00:26:33,964
Just another day at the gym.

435
00:26:34,039 --> 00:26:36,803
There's nobody out there
we're trying to impress.

436
00:26:36,875 --> 00:26:39,400
Half of them are still getting drunk
at happy hour.

437
00:26:39,478 --> 00:26:41,207
-You're in, and you're out.
-Okay.

438
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:44,181
-How you feeling?
-You asked me that five minutes ago.

439
00:26:44,249 --> 00:26:47,980
Will you leave him alone?
We got a fight to do.

440
00:26:49,021 --> 00:26:52,422
This is what we came for, Charlie.
Stay focused. Let's go.

441
00:26:56,361 --> 00:26:58,488
<i>I never saw Charlie's debut.</i>

442
00:27:00,332 --> 00:27:02,698
<i>It was over before I could turn around.</i>

443
00:27:05,304 --> 00:27:08,205
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>
<i>three seconds in the first round.</i>

444
00:27:08,273 --> 00:27:12,232
<i>A winner by TKO: Charlie "Kid" Davis.</i>

445
00:27:20,385 --> 00:27:22,285
<i>Dumas was impressed.</i>

446
00:27:26,458 --> 00:27:30,360
<i>We were on our way. Charlie started</i>
<i>to fight on a regular basis.</i>

447
00:27:35,334 --> 00:27:38,565
<i>The crowds loved his boyish looks</i>
<i>and his all-out fury.</i>

448
00:27:41,273 --> 00:27:45,801
<i>And soon he became a welcome</i>
<i>visitor at Dumas Productions.</i>

449
00:27:46,812 --> 00:27:48,507
He's expecting me.

450
00:27:53,218 --> 00:27:54,378
Enter!

451
00:27:58,590 --> 00:28:02,048
-Mr. Dumas, Charlie Davis to see you.
-Yeah, okay, send him in.

452
00:28:02,928 --> 00:28:04,259
Yeah, that's good.

453
00:28:10,268 --> 00:28:13,465
Hey. Charlie Davis.
Grab yourself a seat.

454
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:16,705
Can't complain, can you, Charlie?

455
00:28:16,775 --> 00:28:20,643
Life right now is palookas sticking out
their chins, so you play knock-knock.

456
00:28:20,712 --> 00:28:22,873
They haven't all been pushovers.

457
00:28:22,948 --> 00:28:27,612
No, that's right. It's a figure of speech.
They've all been Grade "A," pure beef.

458
00:28:28,286 --> 00:28:29,548
It's time to move up.

459
00:28:29,621 --> 00:28:33,489
Time to start fighting for real money
and get you out of that rooming house.

460
00:28:33,558 --> 00:28:36,322
-It's served its purpose.
-Sure it has.

461
00:28:36,695 --> 00:28:40,096
You, the broad, Lou Costello there.
It's a regular sitcom.

462
00:28:40,165 --> 00:28:41,393
Thanks, babe.

463
00:28:41,733 --> 00:28:44,861
Johnny says if I want a title shot,
I gotta do business with you.

464
00:28:44,936 --> 00:28:47,427
I don't want this to come
as a shock to you...

465
00:28:47,506 --> 00:28:50,805
but you can't take a leak in this town
without doing business with me.

466
00:28:50,876 --> 00:28:53,868
I own the porcelain, pipes,
the paper they use to wipe their ass.

467
00:28:53,945 --> 00:28:56,379
So let's forget about
you having any options.

468
00:28:56,448 --> 00:28:59,212
You want a shot at the title,
I'm holding the belt.

469
00:28:59,284 --> 00:29:02,253
It's a one-horse town, Charlie,
and I own the reins.

470
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:05,687
-So what gets done differently?
-Nothing gets done different.

471
00:29:05,924 --> 00:29:09,655
I get all your future fights, and a share
from promoting and managing.

472
00:29:09,728 --> 00:29:12,993
-I have a manager.
-Oh, no, you don't.

473
00:29:14,299 --> 00:29:16,233
You got a dufus from your hometown...

474
00:29:16,301 --> 00:29:19,168
that you let sniff your mouthpiece
and wash out your jock.

475
00:29:19,237 --> 00:29:23,503
He can continue two jobs, as long as
he don't interfere with the battle plan.

476
00:29:23,575 --> 00:29:26,840
-And the percentages?
-30% to promote, 30% to manage.

477
00:29:27,312 --> 00:29:28,370
Plus expenses.

478
00:29:28,447 --> 00:29:31,848
So after it's all said and done,
who am I fighting for?

479
00:29:31,917 --> 00:29:33,714
For the glory, Charlie.

480
00:29:39,958 --> 00:29:42,620
<i>Charlie continued to fight</i>
<i>for the glory.</i>

481
00:29:42,694 --> 00:29:45,492
<i>And Dumas continued to make money</i>
<i>off him.</i>

482
00:29:52,737 --> 00:29:55,501
<i>Gina was still a part of Charlie's life...</i>

483
00:29:55,774 --> 00:29:57,366
<i>although from my perspective...</i>

484
00:29:57,442 --> 00:30:00,536
<i>the combo platter of casino air</i>
<i>and Reno life...</i>

485
00:30:00,679 --> 00:30:04,046
<i>seemed to be pushing her</i>
<i>back towards a freeway ramp...</i>

486
00:30:04,116 --> 00:30:06,050
<i>with an extended thumb.</i>

487
00:30:09,588 --> 00:30:11,180
What's going on, Gina?

488
00:30:13,358 --> 00:30:16,122
This whole situation
is like a furnace, Charlie.

489
00:30:16,194 --> 00:30:19,322
I mean, I thought maybe if I just
gave you some room to breathe...

490
00:30:19,397 --> 00:30:23,197
-maybe we could see things clearer.
-What are you talking about?

491
00:30:23,401 --> 00:30:27,667
You know this place is just temporary.
I'm moving out soon. You, too.

492
00:30:27,739 --> 00:30:31,539
This is a rental town. I feel like
the floor lamp nobody really needs.

493
00:30:31,610 --> 00:30:34,704
I mean, you're looking
for the fully furnished. That's not me.

494
00:30:34,779 --> 00:30:37,839
-Look what's happening to Tiny.
-What are you talking about?

495
00:30:37,916 --> 00:30:40,043
He's getting squeezed right and left.

496
00:30:40,118 --> 00:30:43,281
I mean, he's a blank face
in a neutral corner. He's lost.

497
00:30:43,355 --> 00:30:45,516
And you're just getting started.

498
00:30:45,724 --> 00:30:48,249
I mean, what happens
when the ship comes in?

499
00:30:48,727 --> 00:30:51,195
You'll be holding up your belt,
waving it in the dark.

500
00:30:51,263 --> 00:30:53,891
You'll turn, look at me and say,
"What's she doing here?"

501
00:30:53,965 --> 00:30:56,763
Listen to me, Gina.
You're talking out of exhaustion.

502
00:30:56,835 --> 00:30:59,702
Give up the bar gig.
I can take care of things here.

503
00:30:59,771 --> 00:31:01,363
Give you a chance to sort things out.

504
00:31:01,439 --> 00:31:03,373
That's why you found me
in the first place.

505
00:31:03,441 --> 00:31:04,965
I'm no good at sorting things out.

506
00:31:05,043 --> 00:31:07,068
Don't run no more, Gina. Please.

507
00:31:07,746 --> 00:31:10,214
I can make things good, for all of us.

508
00:31:15,353 --> 00:31:17,947
I gotta make things good for myself.

509
00:31:18,990 --> 00:31:21,220
Otherwise, what is the point?

510
00:31:40,078 --> 00:31:42,706
You got trouble in paradise, Charlie?

511
00:31:47,819 --> 00:31:49,684
You looked drained, Charlie.

512
00:31:49,754 --> 00:31:52,279
Undefeated,
and you look like a beaten man.

513
00:31:53,091 --> 00:31:54,922
Things are getting complicated, no?

514
00:31:54,993 --> 00:31:57,928
That's what happens when you share
your dreams with a stranger.

515
00:31:57,996 --> 00:31:59,020
So I ask you...

516
00:31:59,097 --> 00:32:02,294
what the fuck happened to simplicity
in such a short period of time?

517
00:32:02,367 --> 00:32:03,425
She ain't the problem.

518
00:32:03,501 --> 00:32:07,028
What, you want me to argue with you?
Okay. I'll take your lead.

519
00:32:07,172 --> 00:32:09,868
She's a thumb-waver,
drops in from outer space.

520
00:32:09,941 --> 00:32:13,240
I could put a blindfold over your eyes,
you could take a whiff...

521
00:32:13,311 --> 00:32:16,644
you wouldn't know if it was feast
or famine. Who the fuck you kidding?

522
00:32:16,715 --> 00:32:18,683
She don't interfere with nothing.

523
00:32:18,750 --> 00:32:20,945
She don't interfere,
but she don't help, either.

524
00:32:21,019 --> 00:32:22,680
Either you're helping push the boat...

525
00:32:22,754 --> 00:32:25,450
or you're an anchor,
holding us back to the fucking dock.

526
00:32:25,523 --> 00:32:28,390
-Who needs it, Charlie?
-What do you want me to do?

527
00:32:29,394 --> 00:32:31,988
I got Johnny, Dumas, you--

528
00:32:32,063 --> 00:32:34,463
Don't you even start with a list,
and add me to it...

529
00:32:34,532 --> 00:32:38,298
like I'm a fucking piece of produce.
I dragged you here, Charlie.

530
00:32:38,603 --> 00:32:42,198
All you had were a couple of dreams
without the dick to go chase them.

531
00:32:42,274 --> 00:32:44,037
I been pushing you since forever.

532
00:32:44,109 --> 00:32:47,408
Without me, you're back
in Beaver Falls, fighting in alleys.

533
00:32:54,085 --> 00:32:56,918
We're just getting so close,
I'm starting to get scared.

534
00:32:56,988 --> 00:33:00,151
Look what's happening here.
It's almost time to step up.

535
00:33:00,225 --> 00:33:02,557
Let's not give that moment away.

536
00:33:04,996 --> 00:33:08,295
I gotta find her, Tiny.
You ain't gotta understand it.

537
00:33:13,605 --> 00:33:17,041
Charlie, this has all been planned,
for Christ's sake!

538
00:33:18,310 --> 00:33:20,278
This has all been planned.

539
00:33:22,047 --> 00:33:25,175
<i>I went straight to the bar</i>
<i>and disappeared for a week.</i>

540
00:33:27,719 --> 00:33:29,277
You're gonna be on the fight card.

541
00:33:29,354 --> 00:33:32,721
They're gonna list you
as a special added attraction.

542
00:33:32,791 --> 00:33:35,658
-You seen Tiny?
-No, I haven't seen Tiny.

543
00:33:36,695 --> 00:33:39,391
-You all right? You don't look great.
-I'm all right.

544
00:33:39,464 --> 00:33:42,831
-Tap water? It's bottles in my contract.
-We'll have a case for you.

545
00:33:42,901 --> 00:33:45,028
I don't drink no tap water.

546
00:33:46,371 --> 00:33:48,931
We don't expect any special surprises
from Estrada.

547
00:33:49,007 --> 00:33:51,771
What we expect is that
Estrada will be introduced...

548
00:33:51,843 --> 00:33:54,004
Estrada will bow to the assembled...

549
00:33:54,079 --> 00:33:57,606
and then Estrada will get knocked out.
I don't need to say anything else.

550
00:34:00,018 --> 00:34:01,144
Calm him down, will you?

551
00:34:01,219 --> 00:34:03,619
How about that?
Let's hear it for Mr. Mustafa.

552
00:34:03,688 --> 00:34:04,985
Nice suit you got there.

553
00:34:05,056 --> 00:34:08,389
We're gonna check the drapes
in the show lounge later, you know?

554
00:34:08,460 --> 00:34:12,521
Let's get some of our esteemed guests
up here before we go any further.

555
00:34:12,597 --> 00:34:14,258
Come on right up here, fellas.

556
00:34:14,332 --> 00:34:17,563
What I want to do for those of you
kind enough to stick around...

557
00:34:17,635 --> 00:34:19,603
and eat at my catered affair here...

558
00:34:19,671 --> 00:34:22,765
is to introduce you
to a wonderful, young fighter...

559
00:34:22,974 --> 00:34:25,465
who you're all gonna get to know
before very long.

560
00:34:25,543 --> 00:34:29,104
-He hails from....What is that place?
-Beaver Falls.

561
00:34:29,647 --> 00:34:33,083
Beaver Falls, Pennsylvania.
He fights in the welterweight division...

562
00:34:33,151 --> 00:34:36,882
but he has the heart of a heavyweight.
Let's give it up for Mr. Charlie Davis.

563
00:34:36,955 --> 00:34:38,388
Charlie Davis, okay.

564
00:34:38,456 --> 00:34:41,186
And not only will Charlie be fighting
on that card...

565
00:34:41,259 --> 00:34:43,227
but hopefully, in the very near future...

566
00:34:43,294 --> 00:34:45,660
this man will be competing
for the championship belt.

567
00:34:45,730 --> 00:34:47,698
Yes, sir, that's for sure, okay.

568
00:34:47,766 --> 00:34:50,291
-Any questions here?
-Who's the kid gonna be fighting?

569
00:34:50,368 --> 00:34:51,699
Dietrich, what do you care?

570
00:34:51,770 --> 00:34:55,206
You're about 10 minutes away
from being Rip Taylor's rubdown boy.

571
00:34:55,273 --> 00:34:57,935
Okay, that's right.
The jokes don't get better than that.

572
00:34:58,009 --> 00:34:59,874
Okay, no. In all honesty, though...

573
00:34:59,944 --> 00:35:03,607
Charlie's gonna be fighting
a very quality opponent. The veteran...

574
00:35:05,016 --> 00:35:06,711
Jorge Mendoza.

575
00:35:06,985 --> 00:35:09,044
Wanna translate that name
for them over here?

576
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:12,578
These mooks don't understand it.
That means that man is a contender.

577
00:35:12,657 --> 00:35:14,989
Where is Mendoza?
Why isn't he here right now?

578
00:35:15,059 --> 00:35:18,222
That's because he's back
in his hotel room smoking crack.

579
00:35:19,063 --> 00:35:21,588
Guy's a stone-cold junkie.
You don't know that, huh?

580
00:35:21,666 --> 00:35:24,396
There we go. How about that.
A little entertainment for all.

581
00:35:24,469 --> 00:35:27,529
-Thank you. That's all.
-Get out of here, you fat bastard.

582
00:35:27,605 --> 00:35:29,573
-Who are you?
-Me? I ain't nobody.

583
00:35:29,641 --> 00:35:31,575
-Don't worry.
-Right. He's certainly nobody.

584
00:35:31,643 --> 00:35:35,135
Guy escaped from the lounge, a little
comedy thing we got going on there.

585
00:35:35,213 --> 00:35:36,737
-Thank you.
-That's okay.

586
00:35:36,815 --> 00:35:38,646
The exit's here.
They're looking for you.

587
00:35:38,716 --> 00:35:42,379
-Don't kill yourself. I'm nobody.
-I'm providing entertainment for you.

588
00:35:42,454 --> 00:35:44,649
Hey! I'm not anybody's entertainment!

589
00:35:44,722 --> 00:35:48,488
I'm Tiny O'Toole from Beaver Falls.
Don't nobody here ever forget that!

590
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:51,996
Play me for a motherfucking fool,
I'll kill somebody! Fuck that!

591
00:35:52,063 --> 00:35:54,657
He's gonna kill somebody.
We got a vicious killer beaver!

592
00:35:54,732 --> 00:35:58,133
We don't want him killing nobody,
do we? Come on, let's all settle down.

593
00:35:58,203 --> 00:35:59,670
Get your hands off me.

594
00:36:00,638 --> 00:36:01,935
Stop it!

595
00:36:04,075 --> 00:36:07,340
A free preview. Charlie Davis.
There's more where that came from.

596
00:36:07,412 --> 00:36:10,711
Let's see that Spanky
gets on the bus, okay?

597
00:36:10,782 --> 00:36:12,716
We got any more questions here?

598
00:36:12,784 --> 00:36:14,843
You got a death wish,
for Christ's sake?

599
00:36:14,919 --> 00:36:17,012
I've seen fighters
go after another fighter...

600
00:36:17,088 --> 00:36:19,318
I've seen fighters
go after their ex-wives...

601
00:36:19,390 --> 00:36:22,882
but I've never seen a fighter
who went after a promoter...

602
00:36:22,961 --> 00:36:25,156
who was trying to do
something for him!

603
00:36:25,230 --> 00:36:29,223
And what do you do if somebody
makes a disparaging comment?

604
00:36:29,300 --> 00:36:31,200
I can't let them beat on Tiny.

605
00:36:31,269 --> 00:36:33,533
Come on, you would've done
something different?

606
00:36:33,605 --> 00:36:35,539
You done the right thing.
I'm proud of you.

607
00:36:35,607 --> 00:36:39,407
Shut the fuck up, Tiny! Worst mistake
I ever made was coming out here.

608
00:36:39,544 --> 00:36:40,943
Who needs this circus?

609
00:36:41,012 --> 00:36:45,472
Okay. Let's break this down
and look at the game tape, shall we?

610
00:36:45,783 --> 00:36:47,842
Now, on one hand....Oh, you.

611
00:36:48,686 --> 00:36:51,416
I don't even wanna talk to you,
you dumb drunken bastard.

612
00:36:51,489 --> 00:36:55,323
-What the hell were you yelling about?
-I got a question for you, Dumas.

613
00:36:55,393 --> 00:36:58,692
What are you doing giving out
free liquor at 11:00 in the morning for?

614
00:36:58,763 --> 00:37:02,699
I come from a long line of alcoholics.
You gotta be sensitive to this issue.

615
00:37:02,767 --> 00:37:04,928
I think I got you guys playing
in the wrong room.

616
00:37:05,003 --> 00:37:07,972
I should book you at the Nugget.
We can open for Wayne Newton.

617
00:37:08,039 --> 00:37:11,770
Listen, hope this little incident
sells us a lot of tickets...

618
00:37:11,843 --> 00:37:14,812
because otherwise I can't justify
you knocking out my employees.

619
00:37:14,879 --> 00:37:16,312
I think you broke that guy's nose.

620
00:37:16,381 --> 00:37:18,576
What's with Mendoza?
Bringing him from the clinic?

621
00:37:18,650 --> 00:37:20,481
No! He's been dry for four months.

622
00:37:20,552 --> 00:37:23,817
What do you care? What are you,
Will Rogers all of a sudden?

623
00:37:23,888 --> 00:37:25,583
Just get in the ring and fight the guy.

624
00:37:25,657 --> 00:37:27,852
I don't need to beat up junkies,
Mr. Dumas.

625
00:37:27,926 --> 00:37:30,554
You don't qualify for a title
by rocking a graveyard.

626
00:37:30,628 --> 00:37:32,994
Hey, you qualify when I tell you.

627
00:37:33,064 --> 00:37:36,261
That's the way it works.
This isn't a union apprenticeship.

628
00:37:36,334 --> 00:37:38,325
This be show business.

629
00:37:41,806 --> 00:37:43,967
That's enough of the freebies, okay?

630
00:37:44,042 --> 00:37:46,272
You wanna do any fighting,
save it for the ring.

631
00:37:46,344 --> 00:37:48,005
What he's doing ain't right.

632
00:37:48,079 --> 00:37:51,480
You can't cut up a pie 12 ways
and give yourself nine pieces.

633
00:37:51,549 --> 00:37:53,847
It ain't legal. Plus, you get fat!

634
00:37:54,552 --> 00:37:55,712
What is that?

635
00:37:55,787 --> 00:37:59,018
He's got both players on the card,
plus the building is his?

636
00:37:59,090 --> 00:38:02,389
That's the way they do things here,
you understand, for Christ's sake?

637
00:38:02,460 --> 00:38:05,361
What are you gonna do? You're gonna
come off a Greyhound bus...

638
00:38:05,430 --> 00:38:07,489
come in here,
and straighten everything out?

639
00:38:07,565 --> 00:38:09,465
There are light bulbs
brighter than you!

640
00:38:09,534 --> 00:38:13,300
You don't need to insult me, Johnny.
I brought you gold.

641
00:38:13,404 --> 00:38:17,033
You can stand there and try to pretend
you're handing out favors here...

642
00:38:17,108 --> 00:38:18,632
but until Charlie showed up...

643
00:38:18,710 --> 00:38:21,235
Old Mother Hubbard's cupboard
was bone-dry...

644
00:38:21,312 --> 00:38:25,078
and you and your big rep were
one step away from a fucking valet gig!

645
00:38:25,917 --> 00:38:27,475
Take it easy, Johnny.

646
00:38:30,154 --> 00:38:31,849
I'll see you in the gym.

647
00:38:34,192 --> 00:38:37,628
Here's the bottom line, Tiny.
Get on the fucking Prozac.

648
00:38:37,795 --> 00:38:41,629
-'Cause I can't take much more.
-Charlie, we got the goods, man.

649
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:45,899
Ain't nobody gonna want to rob you
unless you got something to grab.

650
00:38:45,970 --> 00:38:48,530
Dumas knows that. So does Johnny.

651
00:38:48,606 --> 00:38:52,098
Everybody knows
that Mendoza's on the pipe. Come on.

652
00:38:52,276 --> 00:38:54,403
And who are you
telling to get on Prozac?

653
00:38:54,479 --> 00:38:56,970
You're the one chasing
that fucking nut job around.

654
00:38:57,048 --> 00:38:59,881
She is the poster child
for mental illness.

655
00:39:01,853 --> 00:39:03,650
Enough with her, all right?

656
00:39:06,391 --> 00:39:08,325
I learned my lesson.

657
00:39:08,393 --> 00:39:12,557
Look, I ain't never gonna pick up
a fucking hitchhiker again.

658
00:39:12,864 --> 00:39:14,331
I learned my lesson.

659
00:39:14,399 --> 00:39:17,095
I ain't even gonna stop
at a red light no more.

660
00:39:19,404 --> 00:39:21,736
<i>We didn't mention Gina after that.</i>

661
00:39:22,106 --> 00:39:24,097
<i>Charlie, because it was a moot point.</i>

662
00:39:24,175 --> 00:39:28,134
<i>And me, because I didn't want to jinx</i>
<i>our newfound period of peace.</i>

663
00:39:28,946 --> 00:39:32,814
<i>The echoes of silence must've</i>
<i>intrigued her, 'cause she reappeared.</i>

664
00:39:37,121 --> 00:39:39,351
I'm sorry about the other day.

665
00:39:40,925 --> 00:39:43,826
Sometimes I say things
I'm not sure I mean.

666
00:39:47,131 --> 00:39:48,792
I found a place to stay.

667
00:39:49,667 --> 00:39:51,134
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

668
00:39:51,502 --> 00:39:55,939
Nothing special. Just a pit stop that
gives me time to kick things around.

669
00:39:56,774 --> 00:40:01,143
Gina, I'm offering you the chance
to try something. That's all.

670
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:04,810
And I thought
that if you weren't otherwise inclined...

671
00:40:04,882 --> 00:40:07,248
this could be something
that might intrigue you.

672
00:40:07,318 --> 00:40:10,754
But for this to happen, you gotta
stand still. Just for a moment or two.

673
00:40:10,822 --> 00:40:12,847
But you gotta stand still.

674
00:40:13,958 --> 00:40:16,256
Well, I am so inclined, Charlie Davis.

675
00:40:17,995 --> 00:40:20,429
And I wanna try something with you.

676
00:40:21,132 --> 00:40:23,157
And the idea does intrigue me.

677
00:40:25,536 --> 00:40:27,766
And I will try to stand still.

678
00:40:31,809 --> 00:40:34,403
You sure it's not gonna get in the way
of your fighting?

679
00:40:34,479 --> 00:40:37,471
I don't think so.
If it does, I'll let you go.

680
00:40:39,951 --> 00:40:42,146
-You'll let me go?
-I meant I'll let you know.

681
00:40:42,220 --> 00:40:44,347
-That's not what you said.
-That's what I meant.

682
00:40:44,422 --> 00:40:48,882
Look, Gina, I get hit in the head a lot.
At times my thoughts get scrambled.

683
00:40:49,393 --> 00:40:51,520
Yeah, well, I know all about that.

684
00:40:57,034 --> 00:40:59,434
Listen, before we get too far...

685
00:41:00,872 --> 00:41:03,363
maybe you ought to tell me
about the kids.

686
00:41:03,574 --> 00:41:06,771
-What kids?
-Those you got tattooed on your back.

687
00:41:07,745 --> 00:41:10,908
Unless, you know,
you're renting out billboard space.

688
00:41:10,982 --> 00:41:13,951
In high school,
I was involved for a while...

689
00:41:14,352 --> 00:41:17,150
with an older woman, 25, 26.

690
00:41:18,189 --> 00:41:20,487
She had kids
from a previous marriage.

691
00:41:22,059 --> 00:41:24,789
Perhaps my devotion
was a little extreme.

692
00:41:26,864 --> 00:41:30,129
-They are little angels, aren't they?
-Yeah.

693
00:41:33,638 --> 00:41:37,540
-You can't lose with angels, can you?
-That's what I hear.

694
00:41:44,649 --> 00:41:47,243
<i>Dumas turned the rooming house</i>
<i>into history.</i>

695
00:41:47,318 --> 00:41:48,945
<i>His kindness came with a price.</i>

696
00:41:49,020 --> 00:41:51,989
You got your basic setup,
nice refrigerator...

697
00:41:52,690 --> 00:41:55,523
microwave, dishwasher...

698
00:41:56,060 --> 00:41:59,188
beautiful closet space.
Rug was just shampooed.

699
00:41:59,797 --> 00:42:02,630
-How much?
-Mr. Dumas is handling everything.

700
00:42:02,767 --> 00:42:05,463
I don't think we can afford
to have Mr. Dumas handle it.

701
00:42:05,536 --> 00:42:06,662
What can I say?

702
00:42:06,737 --> 00:42:10,036
I'm sorry about the other day.
Got a little carried away.

703
00:42:10,107 --> 00:42:11,768
-Broke my nose, you know.
-Sorry.

704
00:42:11,843 --> 00:42:13,242
I was just doing my job.

705
00:42:13,311 --> 00:42:16,542
Do you think I enjoy this type of work?
I'm trying to make a living.

706
00:42:16,614 --> 00:42:19,174
Years ago I was considering
joining the priesthood.

707
00:42:19,250 --> 00:42:22,219
-Got central air in this joint?
-Box is on the wall.

708
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:23,548
Thanks.

709
00:42:26,424 --> 00:42:28,915
-I guess we're all set here.
-I'll be leaving now.

710
00:42:28,993 --> 00:42:30,017
Thanks.

711
00:42:30,094 --> 00:42:32,722
You need anything else,
you shouldn't hesitate to call.

712
00:42:32,797 --> 00:42:36,164
-Mr. Dumas has got big plans for you.
-I'll remember that.

713
00:42:41,372 --> 00:42:44,637
Toilet's got a nice flush.
It's a beautiful thing, Charlie.

714
00:43:01,592 --> 00:43:03,719
<i>Charlie continued to work hard.</i>

715
00:43:03,794 --> 00:43:08,231
<i>He'd run and train in what appeared</i>
<i>to be a calming sort of solitude.</i>

716
00:43:09,100 --> 00:43:13,400
<i>Alone with his thoughts, it was a part</i>
<i>of the day he seemed to cherish.</i>

717
00:43:14,438 --> 00:43:18,169
<i>But Dumas' watchful gaze</i>
<i>was never very far away.</i>

718
00:43:19,543 --> 00:43:22,239
Hey, kid!
Don't leave it all on the highway.

719
00:43:22,313 --> 00:43:24,975
This ain't the fight
that's going into the archives.

720
00:43:25,049 --> 00:43:28,177
They're all the same, Mr. Dumas.
I don't change the routine.

721
00:43:28,252 --> 00:43:31,449
Don't be so formal.
You ain't got to call me Mr. Dumas.

722
00:43:31,522 --> 00:43:33,752
After all, we're in business together.

723
00:43:33,824 --> 00:43:36,987
Nobody knows your first name.
Doesn't give us many options.

724
00:43:37,061 --> 00:43:40,292
Hell of a way to get respect.
Don't give them a fucking choice.

725
00:43:40,364 --> 00:43:42,764
-Let that be a lesson to you.
-So what do I call you?

726
00:43:42,833 --> 00:43:44,733
I don't know.
We'll come up with something.

727
00:43:44,802 --> 00:43:47,635
I don't think
Mr. Dumas ever introduced us.

728
00:43:47,738 --> 00:43:49,729
-Charlie Davis.
-Felice Gillen.

729
00:43:50,875 --> 00:43:52,467
I'm a big fight fan.

730
00:43:52,543 --> 00:43:55,512
Oh, yeah. She's a real aficionado.

731
00:43:56,180 --> 00:44:00,378
Charlie already has a girlfriend, Felice.
I peg him as the loyal type.

732
00:44:00,985 --> 00:44:02,816
Besides, he's in training.

733
00:44:03,454 --> 00:44:07,413
You don't need this as a distraction,
Charlie. She's highly intoxicating.

734
00:44:07,491 --> 00:44:11,757
I wouldn't be able to pull you off of her.
Ain't that right, sweetheart?

735
00:44:11,829 --> 00:44:13,456
I'm gonna head back to the gym.

736
00:44:13,531 --> 00:44:17,968
Yeah, you go ahead and do that.
That Mendoza, he's a tough cookie!

737
00:44:21,605 --> 00:44:24,369
Keep your punches up in front of you.
Good luck to you both.

738
00:44:24,442 --> 00:44:27,434
<i>Referee Toby Gibson,</i>
<i>giving them their final instructions.</i>

739
00:44:27,511 --> 00:44:30,002
<i>Juan Mendoza,</i>
<i>veteran in the blue trunks.</i>

740
00:44:30,081 --> 00:44:32,811
<i>Charlie "Young Kid" Davis</i>
<i>in the red trunks.</i>

741
00:44:32,883 --> 00:44:35,408
<i>Here we go. Round one.</i>
<i>Davis likes to press the attack.</i>

742
00:44:35,486 --> 00:44:38,683
<i>Told us he'd gonna go after</i>
<i>the veteran, try to get him in the body.</i>

743
00:44:38,756 --> 00:44:41,247
<i>And he's starting off</i>
<i>like a house afire.</i>

744
00:44:41,325 --> 00:44:43,088
<i>Davis moving in.</i>

745
00:44:43,160 --> 00:44:46,823
<i>Mendoza's been through many fights.</i>
<i>He dislikes getting against the ropes.</i>

746
00:44:46,897 --> 00:44:50,162
<i>He knows what kind of damage</i>
<i>the Kid's fists could inflict.</i>

747
00:44:50,468 --> 00:44:53,767
<i>Charlie Davis relentless in his attack.</i>
<i>The Kid....</i>

748
00:44:53,838 --> 00:44:57,706
<i>Mendoza could've been de La Hoya,</i>
<i>for all the good it would've done him.</i>

749
00:44:57,775 --> 00:45:00,107
<i>Charlie's body shots crippled the guy.</i>

750
00:45:00,177 --> 00:45:02,805
<i>You could hear his ribs crack up</i>
<i>in the second mezzanine.</i>

751
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:03,938
That's it, folks.

752
00:45:04,015 --> 00:45:07,849
<i>The crafty veteran is shot</i>
<i>with the body shots. Oh, my.</i>

753
00:45:07,952 --> 00:45:09,647
Stay down. Do yourself a favor.

754
00:45:09,720 --> 00:45:12,052
<i>Charlie Davis is now</i>
<i>in the neutral corner...</i>

755
00:45:12,123 --> 00:45:14,114
<i>as Referee Toby Gibson</i>
<i>begins the count.</i>

756
00:45:14,191 --> 00:45:16,125
<i>I don't think Mendoza's gonna get up.</i>

757
00:45:16,193 --> 00:45:19,094
<i>Devastating triple left hook</i>
<i>to the body...</i>

758
00:45:19,163 --> 00:45:22,291
<i>and that punishment is more</i>
<i>than Mendoza can stand.</i>

759
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:25,563
-That's it, Charlie!
<i>-Charlie Davis' first fight.</i>

760
00:45:25,636 --> 00:45:27,365
<i>He's a local hero, folks.</i>

761
00:45:29,140 --> 00:45:32,769
<i>With a knockout,</i>
<i>at 30 seconds into the first round...</i>

762
00:45:32,843 --> 00:45:36,836
<i>the winner, Charlie "Kid" Davis!</i>

763
00:45:42,520 --> 00:45:45,250
<i>Mendoza had little to offer</i>
<i>while standing.</i>

764
00:45:45,322 --> 00:45:47,085
<i>However, while on the stool...</i>

765
00:45:47,158 --> 00:45:51,026
<i>he cautioned Charlie to protect</i>
<i>himself outside the ring as well.</i>

766
00:45:51,595 --> 00:45:53,620
<i>Some of life's hardest combos...</i>

767
00:45:53,697 --> 00:45:56,723
<i>are apparently not always the ones</i>
<i>you see coming at you.</i>

768
00:45:56,801 --> 00:45:58,860
Man, I feel bad for this guy, Mendoza.

769
00:45:58,936 --> 00:46:01,837
The human body isn't prepared
to take that kind of punishment.

770
00:46:01,906 --> 00:46:04,397
Tremendous body shots,
Charlie, tremendous!

771
00:46:05,276 --> 00:46:07,244
He said something to me.

772
00:46:08,312 --> 00:46:10,780
He said that inside the ring I'd be safe.

773
00:46:11,482 --> 00:46:14,076
But outside, the pain was much worse.

774
00:46:14,385 --> 00:46:15,682
What'd he mean by that?

775
00:46:15,753 --> 00:46:17,778
Nothing.
The guy was beaten to a pulp.

776
00:46:17,855 --> 00:46:20,449
He was delirious.
He wasn't even a fighter anymore!

777
00:46:20,524 --> 00:46:23,652
He should go find a coffee shop
and spout Shakespeare.

778
00:46:23,727 --> 00:46:26,059
Sellers wins tonight, he's next.

779
00:46:26,363 --> 00:46:28,354
Prick's been a charade for years now.

780
00:46:28,432 --> 00:46:30,400
It's about time
somebody threw him a beating.

781
00:46:30,468 --> 00:46:33,733
He's still the champion.
You gotta remember and respect it.

782
00:46:33,804 --> 00:46:35,738
The man has something we want.

783
00:46:35,806 --> 00:46:38,707
Johnny, he's just renting the belt.
He knows that.

784
00:46:38,776 --> 00:46:41,870
He's just another tough guy who's
played one too many lounge acts.

785
00:46:41,946 --> 00:46:43,140
That won't happen to Charlie.

786
00:46:43,214 --> 00:46:45,774
We'll take care of business.
We'll clear out of town.

787
00:46:45,850 --> 00:46:48,648
-Got all the answers, don't you?
-What, I ain't supposed to?

788
00:46:48,719 --> 00:46:50,050
I don't need any shit from you.

789
00:46:50,121 --> 00:46:52,817
What you should do
is go out and roll an old wino...

790
00:46:52,890 --> 00:46:54,653
so you have the price
for another drink.

791
00:46:54,725 --> 00:46:58,354
I'm working here. Believe me, we'll try
to find something to keep you busy.

792
00:46:58,429 --> 00:46:59,726
Enough here.

793
00:46:59,797 --> 00:47:02,595
You wanna have this guy hang around,
fine! I got tolerance.

794
00:47:02,666 --> 00:47:06,261
But sooner or later, people are not
gonna think he's so funny anymore.

795
00:47:06,337 --> 00:47:08,168
-Fuck you, Johnny.
-Hey, come on.

796
00:47:08,239 --> 00:47:10,469
I got a champion here.
Who brought him to you? Me.

797
00:47:10,541 --> 00:47:13,840
Without Charlie, you're just another
errand boy for Siegfried & Roy.

798
00:47:13,911 --> 00:47:16,778
You son of a bitch,
don't you talk like that to me.

799
00:47:16,847 --> 00:47:20,908
Know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna
slap your nuts like a speed bag!

800
00:47:21,385 --> 00:47:25,685
You don't talk that way to me!
Nobody talks that way to Johnny T.

801
00:47:25,756 --> 00:47:29,783
Johnny, the tiger's hungry. Go out
on The Strip and find some bones.

802
00:47:29,860 --> 00:47:32,420
I don't need any shit from him.
Bring me my stuff later.

803
00:47:32,496 --> 00:47:34,589
-I'll break your head some day.
-We'll call it--

804
00:47:34,665 --> 00:47:36,758
Enough! Why don't you get
the fuck out of here?

805
00:47:36,834 --> 00:47:38,324
Swear to God, you're exhausting me.

806
00:47:38,402 --> 00:47:40,632
Glad to see
everybody's still getting along.

807
00:47:40,704 --> 00:47:42,797
Charlie, we need you ringside.

808
00:47:42,873 --> 00:47:46,331
Why don't you go grab a seat and
pretend you're part of the glitterati?

809
00:47:46,410 --> 00:47:48,935
You can watch Sellers
slap this cockroach around...

810
00:47:49,013 --> 00:47:51,846
and then we'll announce
the plans for your future.

811
00:47:52,449 --> 00:47:54,679
Title fight between you and Sellers.

812
00:47:55,452 --> 00:47:58,387
You gonna promote that fight, too,
Mr. Dumas?

813
00:47:58,689 --> 00:48:00,657
What are you getting into,
you filthy fuck?

814
00:48:00,724 --> 00:48:04,558
You got both fighters, promotional
deals, and managerial setups.

815
00:48:04,695 --> 00:48:05,992
Who you rooting for?

816
00:48:06,063 --> 00:48:08,395
I'm rooting for you
to step in front of a bus.

817
00:48:08,465 --> 00:48:11,992
You got some kind of an annoying
habit of opening up your mouth.

818
00:48:14,138 --> 00:48:15,867
See you outside, Charlie.

819
00:48:17,174 --> 00:48:18,436
Try to understand me.

820
00:48:18,509 --> 00:48:22,275
60% plus expenses,
and the guy don't even break a sweat.

821
00:48:23,013 --> 00:48:26,141
He says we fight Sellers.
For how much and when?

822
00:48:26,817 --> 00:48:30,048
All of a sudden Charlie baby's
got a face people turn for.

823
00:48:30,221 --> 00:48:33,190
Is Dumas the only game in town?
Sure. For now.

824
00:48:33,757 --> 00:48:36,248
But the world is always changing,
Charlie.

825
00:48:37,628 --> 00:48:40,062
-We're getting a title shot.
-I know that.

826
00:48:40,130 --> 00:48:43,793
But that's because it makes sense
to Dumas. That's the only reason.

827
00:48:44,368 --> 00:48:47,303
All I'm saying is
it should make sense to us, too.

828
00:48:49,173 --> 00:48:50,401
Come on.

829
00:48:50,774 --> 00:48:53,709
<i>Robin, Rico Estrada</i>
<i>coming in here into Reno...</i>

830
00:48:53,777 --> 00:48:57,076
<i>big crowd, big national television,</i>
<i>he's fighting "The Thrill"...</i>

831
00:48:57,147 --> 00:48:58,739
<i>-does he have a shot?</i>
<i>-You bet.</i>

832
00:48:58,816 --> 00:49:01,250
<i>Fight fans here are gonna end up</i>
<i>being very surprised.</i>

833
00:49:01,318 --> 00:49:04,583
<i>Charlie took a seat ringside</i>
<i>per Dumas' request...</i>

834
00:49:04,655 --> 00:49:08,489
<i>and I'm pretty sure my words of advice</i>
<i>were still ringing in his ears.</i>

835
00:49:08,559 --> 00:49:12,359
<i>But the crafty Dumas counterpunched,</i>
<i>and played another card:</i>

836
00:49:12,429 --> 00:49:13,521
<i>the lady in red.</i>

837
00:49:13,597 --> 00:49:15,394
How does it feel to be the next champ?

838
00:49:15,466 --> 00:49:17,661
Given the alternatives,
I'd say it's pretty good.

839
00:49:17,735 --> 00:49:20,670
I think it's you, Charlie.
Sellers gets by Estrada...

840
00:49:20,738 --> 00:49:24,230
gives us time to drum up some
bad feelings between the two of you.

841
00:49:24,308 --> 00:49:25,605
He didn't beat Estrada yet.

842
00:49:25,676 --> 00:49:28,668
<i>Sellers likes to press the action,</i>
<i>but he's not getting a chance.</i>

843
00:49:28,746 --> 00:49:30,976
<i>Estrada's coming</i>
<i>with rights and lefts to the body.</i>

844
00:49:31,048 --> 00:49:32,845
<i>He's pressed the action</i>
<i>against Sellers...</i>

845
00:49:32,916 --> 00:49:34,611
<i>but the veteran</i>
<i>should be used to this.</i>

846
00:49:34,685 --> 00:49:36,778
<i>Good left job</i>
<i>by Estrada rocks Sellers.</i>

847
00:49:36,854 --> 00:49:39,550
<i>Sellers against the ropes,</i>
<i>Estrada counters body shots.</i>

848
00:49:39,623 --> 00:49:43,320
-This guy, he didn't come here to lose.
-Nobody comes here to lose.

849
00:49:43,394 --> 00:49:45,760
How do you think all the new buildings
keep going up?

850
00:49:45,829 --> 00:49:47,228
He'll have to kill Sellers first.

851
00:49:47,298 --> 00:49:50,199
And even if he does,
best it's gonna get him is a draw.

852
00:49:50,267 --> 00:49:52,531
You can't stop progress, Charlie.

853
00:49:52,603 --> 00:49:54,400
Our deal's already in place.

854
00:49:54,471 --> 00:49:57,099
You don't think
I plan for problems like this?

855
00:49:57,408 --> 00:50:00,775
<i>Final seconds of Round 1.</i>
<i>Sellers trying to hold on.</i>

856
00:50:01,211 --> 00:50:05,443
Why don't you join us for the party?
Bring your little blue-haired friend also.

857
00:50:05,516 --> 00:50:09,384
<i>Sellers trying to get through.</i>
<i>Final moments here of Round 1.</i>

858
00:50:09,453 --> 00:50:11,580
<i>Is he gonna make it? Yes, he does.</i>

859
00:50:39,216 --> 00:50:42,117
-Why don't we just meet up later?
-What?

860
00:50:42,186 --> 00:50:44,381
Back at my place around midnight.

861
00:50:44,455 --> 00:50:46,685
-You leaving?
-Is that bad?

862
00:50:47,091 --> 00:50:51,084
Are people gonna whisper that Charlie
Davis can't hold on to a woman?

863
00:50:51,228 --> 00:50:54,527
<i>They're ready to go with Round 3.</i>
<i>So far, this has been all Estrada.</i>

864
00:50:54,598 --> 00:50:58,034
<i>Can Phil "The Thrill" Sellers muster</i>
<i>it up? Can he come back here?</i>

865
00:50:58,102 --> 00:51:00,400
<i>He's in danger of losing</i>
<i>his world championship.</i>

866
00:51:00,471 --> 00:51:02,837
<i>Here comes Estrada again.</i>
<i>Good right, good lefts.</i>

867
00:51:02,906 --> 00:51:05,374
<i>Sellers in trouble.</i>
<i>The championship may go.</i>

868
00:51:05,442 --> 00:51:08,002
<i>Sellers didn't stand a chance</i>
<i>that night.</i>

869
00:51:08,112 --> 00:51:10,740
<i>But Dumas apparently</i>
<i>wasn't concerned.</i>

870
00:51:10,814 --> 00:51:13,408
<i>He knew the outcome</i>
<i>was never in doubt.</i>

871
00:51:13,484 --> 00:51:15,315
<i>The head butt stopped the fight...</i>

872
00:51:15,386 --> 00:51:18,412
<i>and left the decision</i>
<i>in the hands of Dumas'judges.</i>

873
00:51:19,223 --> 00:51:22,522
<i>The cards were unanimous,</i>
<i>and Sellers was still champ.</i>

874
00:51:22,593 --> 00:51:26,051
<i>Estrada, he had the championship</i>
<i>away from Sellers.</i>

875
00:51:26,130 --> 00:51:29,622
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, the referee,</i>
<i>on the advice of the ringside doctor...</i>

876
00:51:29,700 --> 00:51:33,033
<i>has stopped this fight at two minutes</i>
<i>13 seconds of the second round.</i>

877
00:51:33,103 --> 00:51:36,595
<i>Your winner, and still the</i>
<i>Welterweight Champion of the World:</i>

878
00:51:36,673 --> 00:51:39,437
<i>Phil "The Thrill" Sellers.</i>

879
00:51:59,830 --> 00:52:03,322
It's not my kind of party, okay?
I'll see you at the gym.

880
00:52:03,767 --> 00:52:06,258
-No drinking.
-Okay.

881
00:52:12,443 --> 00:52:15,571
<i>Johnny should've put his morals aside</i>
<i>for a second.</i>

882
00:52:15,646 --> 00:52:18,615
<i>A hundred bare-chested women</i>
<i>were no danger...</i>

883
00:52:18,682 --> 00:52:21,617
<i>compared to one woman</i>
<i>in a red dress.</i>

884
00:52:22,319 --> 00:52:25,345
I would've bet you'd pass
on this extravaganza.

885
00:52:25,923 --> 00:52:27,015
Why is that?

886
00:52:27,090 --> 00:52:30,184
You don't look like the type
to hang out with strangers...

887
00:52:30,260 --> 00:52:31,318
pretending to be happy.

888
00:52:31,395 --> 00:52:33,124
Just doing my job.

889
00:52:33,697 --> 00:52:36,962
-You wanna buy me a drink?
-Is that part of my job?

890
00:52:37,734 --> 00:52:39,531
That's your call.

891
00:52:43,707 --> 00:52:45,766
How do you like those bubbles, girls?

892
00:52:45,843 --> 00:52:49,301
As much as we like you.
Wanna come in?

893
00:52:49,379 --> 00:52:51,779
Champagne. Whatever's locked away.

894
00:52:51,882 --> 00:52:53,645
Water. Whatever's open.

895
00:52:55,319 --> 00:52:58,186
You asked me to buy you a drink,
not take out a small loan.

896
00:52:58,255 --> 00:53:02,385
Aren't we the thrifty small-town boy.
Relax, Charlie. It's on the house.

897
00:53:02,726 --> 00:53:04,751
How come I'm not surprised?

898
00:53:05,529 --> 00:53:09,260
-What's your situation with the girl?
-We're trying to find out.

899
00:53:09,333 --> 00:53:12,097
What's the situation
with you and Dumas?

900
00:53:12,169 --> 00:53:13,727
He's still trying to figure it out.

901
00:53:13,804 --> 00:53:16,170
Shouldn't you and he get things
more clearly defined?

902
00:53:16,240 --> 00:53:17,832
Would that make you feel comfortable?

903
00:53:17,908 --> 00:53:20,843
You've danger lights flashing
around you. Shouldn't I see them?

904
00:53:20,911 --> 00:53:22,708
Opportunity knocks, Charlie.

905
00:53:22,946 --> 00:53:25,881
If I were you, I'd open the door
and take a peek.

906
00:53:27,050 --> 00:53:30,213
And the mouse said,
"Don't blame me, I just got here."

907
00:53:30,320 --> 00:53:33,380
Hey, hold that thought.
I'll be back in minute.

908
00:53:35,559 --> 00:53:38,824
All right,
can I have your attention, please?

909
00:53:39,863 --> 00:53:44,027
Unfortunately, Phil Sellers couldn't be
here for this announcement...

910
00:53:44,101 --> 00:53:47,127
as he's celebrating his victory
in the hospital.

911
00:53:47,237 --> 00:53:50,070
But I want our great fans
to be the first to hear...

912
00:53:50,140 --> 00:53:53,268
that we're very close to
a June 13, title bout...

913
00:53:53,343 --> 00:53:56,506
between Phil
and this town's newest sensation...

914
00:53:56,613 --> 00:53:58,240
Mr. Charlie Davis.

915
00:53:58,315 --> 00:54:00,112
Let's hear it for Charlie.

916
00:54:00,183 --> 00:54:03,118
We anticipate a tremendous match...

917
00:54:03,186 --> 00:54:06,417
as this may very well be
Phil's final rumble.

918
00:54:07,291 --> 00:54:09,316
Then again, maybe not.

919
00:54:10,794 --> 00:54:13,285
He's got the casinos, the federation,
the judges.

920
00:54:13,363 --> 00:54:15,422
To get a shot,
you gotta play ball with him.

921
00:54:15,499 --> 00:54:18,525
But to control your own destiny,
you knock people out.

922
00:54:18,869 --> 00:54:21,997
What becomes the controversy then?
There is none.

923
00:54:22,072 --> 00:54:24,040
You don't let nothing go to the judges.

924
00:54:24,107 --> 00:54:25,096
Time!

925
00:54:26,877 --> 00:54:29,846
Look, everybody knows that Sellers
is at the end of the line.

926
00:54:29,913 --> 00:54:32,643
He cuts, he swells,
he bleeds like a fucking virgin.

927
00:54:32,716 --> 00:54:34,650
But Sellers don't go down.

928
00:54:34,718 --> 00:54:36,948
Now, Dumas can control a situation
like that.

929
00:54:37,020 --> 00:54:40,786
As long as Sellers is still standing,
Dumas is still pulling strings.

930
00:54:41,391 --> 00:54:43,450
Would you stop
filling his head with shit?

931
00:54:43,527 --> 00:54:45,461
We're trying to get ready for a fight.

932
00:54:45,529 --> 00:54:47,360
Put a punctuation point on it...

933
00:54:47,431 --> 00:54:51,060
against Sellers, Mendoza, Estrada,
Mr. Magoo. Leave them on the mat.

934
00:54:51,134 --> 00:54:54,331
Yeah, that's good theory,
but it's easier said than done.

935
00:54:54,404 --> 00:54:56,429
Everyone in town
saw what happened to Estrada.

936
00:54:56,506 --> 00:55:00,840
They boo, tomorrow they forget.
Dumas knows his clientele.

937
00:55:00,911 --> 00:55:03,209
They can't believe
what they just paid to watch.

938
00:55:03,280 --> 00:55:05,646
So, just to make sure,
they're gonna do it again.

939
00:55:05,716 --> 00:55:08,742
We got a job to do.
Let the business take care of itself.

940
00:55:08,819 --> 00:55:12,983
Johnny, I'm not here to argue with you,
no matter what you might feel.

941
00:55:13,056 --> 00:55:15,490
Tiny, there ain't no issue here.

942
00:55:19,129 --> 00:55:22,326
Judges, referees,
ringside physicians...

943
00:55:22,866 --> 00:55:26,358
they can be friends of the family,
members of the board.

944
00:55:26,436 --> 00:55:30,839
Sellers' time has come and gone. Just
find someone who can count to 1 0.

945
00:55:32,309 --> 00:55:34,777
Yeah, all right. I'll go ask around.

946
00:55:37,347 --> 00:55:40,111
You look like you could use a ride.

947
00:55:43,520 --> 00:55:45,579
I gotta admire your persistence.

948
00:55:45,656 --> 00:55:47,954
Kind of wears on you, doesn't it?

949
00:56:08,779 --> 00:56:11,373
<i>This situation</i>
<i>made the whole thing with Gina...</i>

950
00:56:11,448 --> 00:56:13,245
<i>seem like a nursery-school incident.</i>

951
00:56:13,316 --> 00:56:18,015
<i>This chick Felice, I guarantee you,</i>
<i>had never hitchhiked a day in her life.</i>

952
00:56:18,655 --> 00:56:22,147
<i>Charlie was sucked in by the stench</i>
<i>of her snake oil charm...</i>

953
00:56:22,225 --> 00:56:25,023
<i>and was ready to follow her</i>
<i>into the sunset.</i>

954
00:56:25,095 --> 00:56:29,589
<i>Somewhere in the distance, I could</i>
<i>see Dumas yanking on the strings.</i>

955
00:57:10,307 --> 00:57:12,741
Hey, kid! How you doing?

956
00:57:14,010 --> 00:57:15,773
That robe fits you nice.

957
00:57:16,146 --> 00:57:18,341
I didn't know this was your place,
Mr. Dumas.

958
00:57:18,415 --> 00:57:20,975
Well, it's all mine, Charlie.
The whole town.

959
00:57:21,051 --> 00:57:24,077
-I guess you didn't take me literally.
-I better get going.

960
00:57:24,154 --> 00:57:26,486
No. Where you going?
Stick around, sit down.

961
00:57:26,556 --> 00:57:30,048
Finish your meal.
You're in training, for God's sake.

962
00:57:30,694 --> 00:57:33,561
That Felice.
She throws a nice spread, don't she?

963
00:57:33,630 --> 00:57:35,427
Yeah. She's terrific.

964
00:57:39,770 --> 00:57:41,761
So, Charlie, what's happening?

965
00:57:41,838 --> 00:57:44,830
-She sort of invited me over.
-No, I'm not talking about that.

966
00:57:44,908 --> 00:57:48,901
Do I look like the jealous type to you?
We're in business together.

967
00:57:48,979 --> 00:57:51,777
Look, let's make a rule of thumb
from now on.

968
00:57:51,848 --> 00:57:56,217
What's mine is yours, and what's
yours, well, that's still yours.

969
00:57:56,653 --> 00:58:01,352
And if the mood strikes you,
once in a while, you share with me.

970
00:58:01,458 --> 00:58:03,323
Anything in particular?

971
00:58:05,762 --> 00:58:07,093
I'll let you know.

972
00:58:07,164 --> 00:58:09,189
Come on! Three, three!

973
00:58:09,266 --> 00:58:10,528
It's a nine.

974
00:58:10,600 --> 00:58:12,227
Sorry, it's out.

975
00:58:12,302 --> 00:58:15,271
-I need a little credit here.
-New bets, everyone, new bets.

976
00:58:15,338 --> 00:58:18,671
A little credit, another seven
and seven, and a little fucking respect!

977
00:58:18,742 --> 00:58:21,677
Tiny O'Toole in the house,
motherfuckers!

978
00:58:22,145 --> 00:58:24,636
-What?
-How about we take a little walk, pal?

979
00:58:24,714 --> 00:58:27,842
How about you get your teeth cleaned?
You fucking stink!

980
00:58:28,251 --> 00:58:30,276
Hey! Fuck you, man! Get off me!

981
00:58:30,353 --> 00:58:32,082
You're out of here! Come on. Let's go!

982
00:58:40,197 --> 00:58:42,131
He took care of fat boy.

983
00:58:42,299 --> 00:58:44,927
I'm surprised Tiny isn't here.
He said he'd meet us.

984
00:58:45,001 --> 00:58:46,935
What can I tell you?
He has his own agenda.

985
00:58:47,003 --> 00:58:49,233
<i>While Charlie waited</i>
<i>for his pre-fight physical...</i>

986
00:58:49,306 --> 00:58:52,798
<i>I waited in the emergency room,</i>
<i>thanks to Dumas' henchmen.</i>

987
00:58:52,876 --> 00:58:55,640
<i>Sellers had just bluffed his way</i>
<i>through an eye exam...</i>

988
00:58:55,712 --> 00:58:57,407
<i>and stopped</i>
<i>to exchange pleasantries.</i>

989
00:58:57,480 --> 00:59:00,381
What do you got for me, Johnny?
A real thing?

990
00:59:00,684 --> 00:59:03,619
Or just another pretender
rolling through town?

991
00:59:03,687 --> 00:59:06,952
-Why don't we keep that a surprise?
-Yeah, why not?

992
00:59:10,594 --> 00:59:11,925
I never liked that guy.

993
00:59:11,995 --> 00:59:13,963
<i>I'm sure the feeling was mutual.</i>

994
00:59:14,030 --> 00:59:15,759
Okay, champ, let's go.

995
01:00:06,850 --> 01:00:11,219
<i>Training continued while I went off</i>
<i>to lick my wounds, drown my sorrows.</i>

996
01:00:12,255 --> 01:00:15,747
<i>I needed to rethink our relationship,</i>
<i>our goals, our dreams.</i>

997
01:00:16,760 --> 01:00:19,194
<i>I wasn't sure</i>
<i>we shared them anymore.</i>

998
01:00:19,763 --> 01:00:22,129
<i>Meanwhile,</i>
<i>by process of elimination...</i>

999
01:00:22,198 --> 01:00:26,635
<i>Gina suddenly found herself cast</i>
<i>in the role of the nice girl next door.</i>

1000
01:00:26,770 --> 01:00:29,204
<i>That's 'cause Felice had already</i>
<i>chosen her part.</i>

1001
01:00:30,473 --> 01:00:31,599
Who is it?

1002
01:00:34,110 --> 01:00:35,304
-Hi.
-Hi.

1003
01:00:35,378 --> 01:00:38,870
You just caught me on my way to work.
Come on in. Come in.

1004
01:00:42,419 --> 01:00:45,718
-I'll be fighting Sellers for the title.
-Yeah, I know.

1005
01:00:45,789 --> 01:00:49,281
Next to the early-bird special,
it's the hottest ticket in town.

1006
01:00:49,693 --> 01:00:50,853
I'm nervous, Gina.

1007
01:00:50,927 --> 01:00:54,727
Everything I thought was taking
so long is suddenly moving so fast.

1008
01:00:55,765 --> 01:00:57,960
It kind of alters
your breathing patterns.

1009
01:00:58,034 --> 01:01:00,628
-You afraid of getting hurt?
-Not in the ring.

1010
01:01:05,241 --> 01:01:07,971
-I'll let you get going to work.
-Yeah.

1011
01:01:10,880 --> 01:01:14,441
Back in the beginning,
you said something to me.

1012
01:01:14,985 --> 01:01:16,782
I'm not sure you meant it.

1013
01:01:16,886 --> 01:01:18,114
What'd I say?

1014
01:01:18,755 --> 01:01:22,247
You said you wanted me
to ride with you for a while...

1015
01:01:23,126 --> 01:01:26,618
'cause together you thought
we might add up to something nice.

1016
01:01:26,696 --> 01:01:28,391
You still believe that, Charlie?

1017
01:01:28,465 --> 01:01:31,229
I don't know what I believe
anymore, Gina.

1018
01:01:43,046 --> 01:01:45,276
<i>Ladies and gentlemen...</i>

1019
01:01:45,348 --> 01:01:49,512
<i>Dumas Productions in association</i>
<i>with the Eldorado Hotel....</i>

1020
01:02:03,566 --> 01:02:06,057
All right, you guys, get ready. Let's go.

1021
01:02:16,546 --> 01:02:20,983
<i>That night was the first time</i>
<i>that Charlie entered a ring without me.</i>

1022
01:02:21,051 --> 01:02:25,988
<i>I knew I should've been with him, but I</i>
<i>couldn't bring myself to take the stroll.</i>

1023
01:02:27,023 --> 01:02:31,824
<i>I snuck in after the opening bell, like</i>
<i>a thief going through a store window.</i>

1024
01:02:33,430 --> 01:02:37,526
<i>That prize being offered that night</i>
<i>was partially mine...</i>

1025
01:02:38,368 --> 01:02:41,337
<i>and yet</i>
<i>I couldn't allow myself to collect.</i>

1026
01:02:44,641 --> 01:02:47,940
<i>Introducing first the challenger,</i>
<i>out of the blue corner...</i>

1027
01:02:48,011 --> 01:02:50,775
<i>he hails from Beaver Falls,</i>
<i>Pennsylvania.</i>

1028
01:02:50,847 --> 01:02:53,680
<i>145 pounds...</i>

1029
01:02:53,883 --> 01:02:56,784
<i>a perfect 21 wins, no losses...</i>

1030
01:02:56,886 --> 01:02:59,446
<i>a record including 20 knockouts...</i>

1031
01:02:59,522 --> 01:03:03,788
<i>please welcome Charlie "Kid" Davis!</i>

1032
01:03:06,930 --> 01:03:11,560
<i>And out of the red corner,</i>
<i>the Champion of the World.</i>

1033
01:03:11,868 --> 01:03:15,463
<i>He weighs in at 1 46 pounds.</i>

1034
01:03:15,538 --> 01:03:19,907
<i>A record of 45 and seven,</i>
<i>21 knockouts...</i>

1035
01:03:19,976 --> 01:03:22,171
<i>from the Brownsville section</i>
<i>of Brooklyn....</i>

1036
01:03:22,312 --> 01:03:25,247
-Where's Tiny?
-Never mind where Tiny is!

1037
01:03:25,315 --> 01:03:28,216
Keep your goddamn focus in the ring!

1038
01:03:28,384 --> 01:03:29,612
<i>Where is O'Toole?</i>

1039
01:03:29,686 --> 01:03:33,918
<i>This has to be on his mind as he gets</i>
<i>ready for the biggest fight of his life.</i>

1040
01:03:34,591 --> 01:03:37,185
<i>Final instructions.</i>
<i>Here we go. Round one.</i>

1041
01:03:37,260 --> 01:03:42,095
<i>Phil Sellers, the World Champ,</i>
<i>45 wins, 7 losses, 21 knockouts...</i>

1042
01:03:42,532 --> 01:03:45,831
<i>"Kid" Davis, the big crowd favorite.</i>
<i>They love him here in Reno.</i>

1043
01:03:45,902 --> 01:03:48,700
<i>He's still looking around,</i>
<i>as we start the first round...</i>

1044
01:03:48,771 --> 01:03:50,068
<i>for Tiny O'Toole. Here we go.</i>

1045
01:03:50,140 --> 01:03:53,041
<i>Charlie Davis usually likes to</i>
<i>press the action, come in...</i>

1046
01:03:53,109 --> 01:03:56,408
<i>and we're seeing a bit of that,</i>
<i>but I don't see the aggressiveness...</i>

1047
01:03:56,479 --> 01:03:57,969
<i>we usually see from Charlie Davis.</i>

1048
01:03:58,047 --> 01:04:00,038
<i>Good left-right combination</i>
<i>right there.</i>

1049
01:04:00,116 --> 01:04:02,050
<i>Phil Sellers, though,</i>
<i>not one to give up.</i>

1050
01:04:02,118 --> 01:04:04,450
<i>He comes right back</i>
<i>with a good left upper cut.</i>

1051
01:04:04,521 --> 01:04:06,421
<i>Good combination by Sellers.</i>

1052
01:04:06,489 --> 01:04:09,151
<i>Davis now backing up.</i>
<i>He's got Davis into the ropes.</i>

1053
01:04:09,225 --> 01:04:13,093
<i>First time in his career that Charlie</i>
<i>Davis has been against the ropes.</i>

1054
01:04:18,268 --> 01:04:21,260
Tiny! What happened?

1055
01:04:22,005 --> 01:04:23,973
Can't get a good steak in this town.

1056
01:04:24,040 --> 01:04:27,100
Tried to send it back,
feathers got ruffled.

1057
01:04:29,179 --> 01:04:32,444
<i>Again, Sellers pressing the attack.</i>
<i>And a good shot!</i>

1058
01:04:32,515 --> 01:04:35,143
<i>But back comes Davis.</i>
<i>What a great round.</i>

1059
01:04:35,218 --> 01:04:38,051
<i>These two guys</i>
<i>are going to war, folks.</i>

1060
01:04:38,121 --> 01:04:41,989
<i>Forty-two shots, one after another,</i>
<i>back and forth.</i>

1061
01:04:42,058 --> 01:04:45,357
<i>Great first round action.</i>
<i>And there's the bell.</i>

1062
01:04:45,428 --> 01:04:49,592
<i>A great round between Sellers and</i>
<i>Davis. The crowd is into this thing.</i>

1063
01:04:49,666 --> 01:04:53,067
<i>And look at this,</i>
<i>he's finally spotted his old mate.</i>

1064
01:04:53,136 --> 01:04:54,797
What happened to Tiny?

1065
01:04:54,904 --> 01:04:59,068
He pissed off a lot of people, Charlie.
Someone must've taught him a lesson.

1066
01:05:02,312 --> 01:05:03,870
<i>He's getting squeezed right and left.</i>

1067
01:05:03,947 --> 01:05:04,971
<i>He's lost.</i>

1068
01:05:05,048 --> 01:05:06,345
<i>And you're just getting started.</i>

1069
01:05:06,416 --> 01:05:07,974
<i>You got a dufus</i>
<i>from your hometown...</i>

1070
01:05:08,051 --> 01:05:10,383
<i>you let sniff your mouthpiece</i>
<i>and wash out your jock.</i>

1071
01:05:10,453 --> 01:05:12,444
<i>This has all been planned,</i>
<i>for Christ's sake!</i>

1072
01:05:12,522 --> 01:05:14,513
<i>Answer the bell,</i>
<i>'cause it's ringing for you.</i>

1073
01:05:14,591 --> 01:05:17,424
<i>Your father's dead and we're</i>
<i>one step away from joining him.</i>

1074
01:05:17,493 --> 01:05:19,188
<i>This whole situation is like a furnace.</i>

1075
01:05:19,262 --> 01:05:20,820
<i>I dragged you here, Charlie.</i>

1076
01:05:20,897 --> 01:05:24,196
<i>All you had were a couple of dreams</i>
<i>without the dick to go chase them.</i>

1077
01:05:24,267 --> 01:05:25,256
<i>Answer the bell, Charlie.</i>

1078
01:05:25,335 --> 01:05:26,461
<i>God gave you strength...</i>

1079
01:05:26,536 --> 01:05:28,902
<i>and he gave you a heart.</i>
<i>Body and soul, Charlie.</i>

1080
01:05:33,309 --> 01:05:36,437
<i>And here's the second round.</i>
<i>The first round was a real rugged....</i>

1081
01:05:36,512 --> 01:05:40,505
<i>Look at this. Davis comes flying off</i>
<i>his chair! It is the old Charlie Davis!</i>

1082
01:05:40,583 --> 01:05:42,244
<i>The challenger presses the champion.</i>

1083
01:05:42,318 --> 01:05:44,513
<i>Sellers in trouble against the ropes...</i>

1084
01:05:44,587 --> 01:05:46,919
<i>Davis going to the body,</i>
<i>back up to the head.</i>

1085
01:05:46,990 --> 01:05:50,619
<i>A left to the body,</i>
<i>right to the body, pressing him.</i>

1086
01:05:57,333 --> 01:06:00,166
<i>The crowd on their feet.</i>
<i>They're going crazy here.</i>

1087
01:06:02,171 --> 01:06:05,163
<i>Sellers is in trouble.</i>
<i>Right hook by Davis.</i>

1088
01:06:05,241 --> 01:06:08,733
<i>Sellers barely able to stand</i>
<i>on his feet, and down he goes.</i>

1089
01:06:08,978 --> 01:06:10,605
<i>Down goes the champion.</i>

1090
01:06:24,027 --> 01:06:26,359
It's hard work to beat up a blind man.

1091
01:06:30,867 --> 01:06:32,357
Champion of the World.

1092
01:06:32,435 --> 01:06:34,630
<i>Charlie had become a champ...</i>

1093
01:06:34,704 --> 01:06:38,196
<i>and yet I felt that I had taken</i>
<i>the more severe body shots.</i>

1094
01:06:39,008 --> 01:06:42,910
<i>Part of me wanted to cry, and another</i>
<i>part of me wanted to laugh.</i>

1095
01:06:43,980 --> 01:06:46,881
<i>For some reason, I couldn't do either.</i>

1096
01:06:59,429 --> 01:07:01,454
-Congratulations, champ.
-Gina?

1097
01:07:02,832 --> 01:07:04,925
Sorry to disappoint you.

1098
01:07:05,134 --> 01:07:08,831
You're not disappointing me.
I just thought you were someone else.

1099
01:07:08,971 --> 01:07:13,135
She left right after the fight.
Looks like a Sellers fan to me.

1100
01:07:13,209 --> 01:07:17,509
Yeah, well, I think the whole thing
was a little overwhelming for her.

1101
01:07:17,814 --> 01:07:19,281
You know what they say:

1102
01:07:19,349 --> 01:07:21,943
"It takes a man's woman
to deal with a man's game."

1103
01:07:22,018 --> 01:07:23,610
Is that what they say?

1104
01:07:30,460 --> 01:07:32,519
So, what do you want to do, champ?

1105
01:07:41,571 --> 01:07:44,802
-Good evening. Nice to see you.
-Hi, how are you?

1106
01:07:44,874 --> 01:07:46,865
Hi. Congratulations. Great fight.

1107
01:07:46,943 --> 01:07:49,468
<i>Felice and Charlie</i>
<i>hit the town that night.</i>

1108
01:07:49,545 --> 01:07:52,173
<i>Their first stop was the Roxy Bistro.</i>

1109
01:07:52,248 --> 01:07:55,547
<i>They didn't need a reservation.</i>
<i>A table was already waiting.</i>

1110
01:07:55,952 --> 01:07:58,921
Hey, Charlie. Sit down.

1111
01:08:01,557 --> 01:08:05,049
I never got a chance
to lift in your honor.

1112
01:08:05,828 --> 01:08:07,318
What's with Sellers?

1113
01:08:07,397 --> 01:08:09,194
That's very simple.

1114
01:08:09,265 --> 01:08:12,166
First he had the belt,
and now you got it.

1115
01:08:12,769 --> 01:08:14,999
I'm leasing you a shot at life, Charlie.

1116
01:08:15,071 --> 01:08:18,438
From this moment on, everything
you get is a fucking loaner.

1117
01:08:19,842 --> 01:08:20,866
To your health.

1118
01:08:20,943 --> 01:08:22,376
What about Felice?

1119
01:08:22,445 --> 01:08:26,779
Well, Felice, she's a grown woman.
I think she knows the score.

1120
01:08:27,216 --> 01:08:29,309
So what's the score, Felice?

1121
01:08:29,786 --> 01:08:32,516
Don't say anything stupid,
and leave well enough alone.

1122
01:08:32,588 --> 01:08:35,489
You want me to put her on the tab?
I got no problem with that.

1123
01:08:35,558 --> 01:08:36,991
Look, it's all right.

1124
01:08:37,059 --> 01:08:40,290
Just play the game, walk a straight
line, and good things will come.

1125
01:08:40,363 --> 01:08:44,424
She's a smart girl, Charlie.
You could learn something from her.

1126
01:08:44,667 --> 01:08:47,795
Well, you got a defense in six weeks.

1127
01:08:47,870 --> 01:08:51,271
Don't drink nothing tonight
you can't piss out tomorrow.

1128
01:08:51,340 --> 01:08:53,672
-Who am I fighting?
-Not to worry.

1129
01:08:54,310 --> 01:08:56,505
I'll find you another cripple.

1130
01:08:58,481 --> 01:09:00,073
Champion of the World!

1131
01:09:19,135 --> 01:09:20,363
I gotta stop.

1132
01:09:22,839 --> 01:09:26,104
-Where you going?
-I'll be right back.

1133
01:09:35,751 --> 01:09:37,446
What are you doing, Tiny?

1134
01:09:38,054 --> 01:09:40,249
Having a fucking drink.
What's the problem?

1135
01:09:40,323 --> 01:09:41,950
Let me know what's going on.

1136
01:09:42,024 --> 01:09:44,390
I got mugged waiting for a bus.

1137
01:09:44,594 --> 01:09:49,293
Do you want me to name names?
I think we all know where it came from.

1138
01:09:50,833 --> 01:09:53,859
What can I tell you?
It's a personality conflict.

1139
01:09:53,936 --> 01:09:56,427
-Not everybody's gonna love me.
-I love you, man.

1140
01:09:56,506 --> 01:09:59,168
I want you to come back.
Stay with me, work the corner.

1141
01:09:59,242 --> 01:10:01,938
You ain't got no openings.
Everything's full.

1142
01:10:03,045 --> 01:10:06,310
I could suck your dick,
but I think that slot's already taken.

1143
01:10:06,382 --> 01:10:08,213
Besides, I can barely move my neck.

1144
01:10:08,284 --> 01:10:10,184
Let's stop with the funny for a second.

1145
01:10:10,253 --> 01:10:12,551
What, are you kidding me?
That's what I do.

1146
01:10:12,622 --> 01:10:15,022
Fucking mouth's got a life of its own.

1147
01:10:15,892 --> 01:10:18,258
That's why we ended up here
in the first place.

1148
01:10:18,327 --> 01:10:19,988
I wouldn't let up, remember?

1149
01:10:22,198 --> 01:10:23,927
So what do you wanna do next?

1150
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:27,492
I'm gonna go grab a cup and a cane,
go out on the corner.

1151
01:10:28,571 --> 01:10:32,405
Look, Charlie, I ain't no charity case.
You don't gotta worry about nothing.

1152
01:10:32,475 --> 01:10:33,874
Tiny, I didn't say that.

1153
01:10:33,943 --> 01:10:37,037
Where you going? Tiny!

1154
01:10:41,984 --> 01:10:44,043
-Did you find him?
-Yeah.

1155
01:10:45,421 --> 01:10:47,286
What did he say?

1156
01:10:48,057 --> 01:10:49,490
Only good things.

1157
01:11:01,771 --> 01:11:06,174
<i>Charlie moved into a penthouse suite,</i>
<i>and I took a room down at the "Y."</i>

1158
01:11:19,855 --> 01:11:22,619
<i>He made several</i>
<i>lackluster title defenses...</i>

1159
01:11:22,692 --> 01:11:25,661
<i>as the fast lane competed</i>
<i>for his services.</i>

1160
01:11:25,728 --> 01:11:29,027
<i>I was miserable,</i>
<i>and Johnny wasn't thrilled, either.</i>

1161
01:11:33,436 --> 01:11:37,099
Come here.

1162
01:11:38,240 --> 01:11:40,868
What the hell was that
you were doing?

1163
01:11:41,644 --> 01:11:42,804
I'm working.

1164
01:11:42,878 --> 01:11:44,846
-You were training?
-Yeah.

1165
01:11:44,914 --> 01:11:48,406
You better put your heart in it, or
you're gonna lose your championship.

1166
01:11:48,484 --> 01:11:50,975
No more the Champ of the World!
Wake up.

1167
01:12:06,135 --> 01:12:10,731
<i>Charlie became a casino fixture,</i>
<i>and was oblivious to all that watched.</i>

1168
01:12:11,374 --> 01:12:15,071
<i>Despite lousy training habits,</i>
<i>he was able to keep winning fights...</i>

1169
01:12:15,177 --> 01:12:17,668
<i>thanks to Dumas' handpicked judges.</i>

1170
01:12:18,180 --> 01:12:20,978
<i>At the tables,</i>
<i>he gambled like a blind man...</i>

1171
01:12:21,050 --> 01:12:24,747
<i>smiling, as the money slipped back</i>
<i>into Dumas' casino vaults.</i>

1172
01:12:43,773 --> 01:12:46,936
How much longer will the alphabets
let you avoid this kid?

1173
01:12:47,009 --> 01:12:48,772
He's 28 and 0, all KO's.

1174
01:12:48,844 --> 01:12:50,436
He's got a following of cockroaches...

1175
01:12:50,513 --> 01:12:52,140
willing to shovel under the border...

1176
01:12:52,214 --> 01:12:54,079
just to see him fight.
We gotta grab him.

1177
01:12:54,150 --> 01:12:58,246
-How to pronounce his name again?
-Casilios. Rueben "El Raton" Casilios.

1178
01:12:58,320 --> 01:13:00,845
-El Raton?
-Yeah. The Rat.

1179
01:13:00,923 --> 01:13:02,823
Fucker's got the right nickname,
don't he?

1180
01:13:02,892 --> 01:13:04,951
With a belt,
he's as handsome as the next guy.

1181
01:13:05,027 --> 01:13:08,019
-What happens if Davis beats him?
-He'll have to kill him first.

1182
01:13:08,097 --> 01:13:10,930
I don't see El Raton going down easy,
do you?

1183
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:13,264
He finishes the fight on his feet,
we're okay.

1184
01:13:13,335 --> 01:13:15,360
Here's what we do.
We bring The Rat into town.

1185
01:13:15,438 --> 01:13:18,771
We give him a mattress, teach him
how to use a knife and a fork...

1186
01:13:18,841 --> 01:13:20,536
he'll think he died and went to heaven.

1187
01:13:20,609 --> 01:13:24,101
After that, everything we do nice
for him, we'll own him for life.

1188
01:13:24,180 --> 01:13:26,512
-Charlie isn't filling up the pit.
-He's doing okay.

1189
01:13:26,582 --> 01:13:27,844
-He's got a following.
-Yeah.

1190
01:13:27,917 --> 01:13:29,612
But 20,000 of these half-breed Incas...

1191
01:13:29,685 --> 01:13:31,744
will bring in more than
9,000 Homer Simpsons.

1192
01:13:31,821 --> 01:13:35,985
And even if they drop just $0.50
in the slots, it's all gonna add up.

1193
01:13:38,160 --> 01:13:40,958
Yeah? Sure, send him in.

1194
01:13:42,364 --> 01:13:43,797
It's Charlie Davis.

1195
01:13:47,670 --> 01:13:50,696
-How're you doing, champ?
-I wanna make some changes.

1196
01:13:50,773 --> 01:13:52,104
Yeah, who doesn't?

1197
01:13:52,174 --> 01:13:55,666
You get to promote one more fight,
after that, I'm a free agent.

1198
01:13:56,078 --> 01:13:59,275
That's a mouthful, Charlie.
Better let me digest that.

1199
01:13:59,348 --> 01:14:02,806
-I think what Charlie's trying to say--
-I know what he's trying to say.

1200
01:14:02,885 --> 01:14:04,147
You wanna test the waters.

1201
01:14:04,220 --> 01:14:06,745
Don't get me wrong.
I appreciate what you've given me.

1202
01:14:06,822 --> 01:14:08,483
Sure you do, Charlie.

1203
01:14:08,557 --> 01:14:11,583
Now, you wanna hear a shocker?
I agree with you.

1204
01:14:11,727 --> 01:14:14,855
I think we should cut the cord
before it strangles us both.

1205
01:14:14,930 --> 01:14:16,488
What do you say, fellows?

1206
01:14:16,565 --> 01:14:20,365
You give me one more defense,
and you can take your title and go.

1207
01:14:20,436 --> 01:14:25,271
Then, if you want me to promote any of
your future ventures, we'll reconvene.

1208
01:14:25,341 --> 01:14:27,809
-What do you say?
-Why are you making this so simple?

1209
01:14:27,877 --> 01:14:32,507
Let's just cut to the chase, okay?
If you're not happy, no one's happy.

1210
01:14:32,782 --> 01:14:36,274
It's the trickledown theory,
misery loves company.

1211
01:14:36,585 --> 01:14:41,045
But I ain't in the mood to take in any
guests at this time, you understand?

1212
01:14:41,223 --> 01:14:44,989
Let's just end and leave
with the memories, shall we?

1213
01:14:45,427 --> 01:14:48,521
Some good, some questionable...

1214
01:14:48,597 --> 01:14:52,089
but memories nonetheless.

1215
01:14:52,568 --> 01:14:54,058
Who do you want me to fight?

1216
01:14:54,136 --> 01:14:55,797
Sit down, Charlie.

1217
01:14:56,505 --> 01:14:59,599
"El Raton" Casilios.

1218
01:14:59,809 --> 01:15:01,242
I don't know much about this guy.

1219
01:15:01,310 --> 01:15:05,303
Well, I gotta be honest with you,
Charlie. This Rat can take a shot.

1220
01:15:05,381 --> 01:15:07,747
All we want you to do
is slap him around for 12.

1221
01:15:07,817 --> 01:15:11,776
We're not looking for a performance
clause, just another day at the office.

1222
01:15:11,854 --> 01:15:13,253
After Casilios I can walk?

1223
01:15:13,322 --> 01:15:15,449
Hey, you could run.

1224
01:15:16,926 --> 01:15:19,156
I gotta talk to Johnny about this.

1225
01:15:19,228 --> 01:15:20,991
Be my guest, Charlie.

1226
01:15:21,764 --> 01:15:25,256
But the Kid who became champion,
he could've cared less.

1227
01:15:25,668 --> 01:15:29,729
When you fell off that bus,
you'd have fought Tyson. In the joint.

1228
01:15:31,040 --> 01:15:33,600
Let me give you
a piece of advice, Charlie.

1229
01:15:34,009 --> 01:15:37,501
Don't get cautious,
'cause the step after that is fear...

1230
01:15:38,013 --> 01:15:40,607
and the step after that is defeat.

1231
01:15:42,751 --> 01:15:44,184
<i>What's it gonna be today?</i>

1232
01:15:44,253 --> 01:15:46,881
-You gonna work or what?
-I'm working, Johnny.

1233
01:15:46,956 --> 01:15:49,083
-You run this morning?
-Some.

1234
01:15:49,191 --> 01:15:50,556
Some is shit!

1235
01:15:51,994 --> 01:15:53,222
What about Casilios?

1236
01:15:53,295 --> 01:15:56,059
What about him? He's got
a pretty record and an ugly face.

1237
01:15:56,131 --> 01:15:59,532
He never fought anybody
north of the border, for Christ's sake.

1238
01:15:59,602 --> 01:16:00,796
So what's that mean?

1239
01:16:00,870 --> 01:16:04,465
It means if you train for real,
for Christ's sake, you can stop him.

1240
01:16:04,540 --> 01:16:08,772
If you don't, and keep parading around
like a lounge lizard, my friend...

1241
01:16:08,844 --> 01:16:11,438
you're gonna wind up
with it going to the cards.

1242
01:16:11,513 --> 01:16:15,005
Meanwhile, your fans will be
fast asleep. Is that clear?

1243
01:16:20,422 --> 01:16:22,413
Well, it's up to you.

1244
01:16:22,491 --> 01:16:26,359
It's always up to Charlie lately. You're
the one that makes the decisions.

1245
01:16:26,428 --> 01:16:28,658
What's it gonna be, Charlie baby?

1246
01:16:30,866 --> 01:16:32,595
Where you going, big shot?

1247
01:16:33,435 --> 01:16:38,065
I hear that Dumas wants everything
but the family jewels on Casilios.

1248
01:16:38,140 --> 01:16:39,937
What, they're changing the guard?

1249
01:16:40,009 --> 01:16:43,376
Charlie's had his run.
Everything moves on, no?

1250
01:16:43,445 --> 01:16:45,572
And besides,
this new kid comes cheap.

1251
01:16:45,648 --> 01:16:47,115
Charlie's done all right.

1252
01:16:47,182 --> 01:16:50,481
If he puts something away,
he can open up a fucking café.

1253
01:16:50,552 --> 01:16:53,419
This other kid, Casilios,
he got a simple mission.

1254
01:16:53,489 --> 01:16:56,458
Find the fucking arena,
and end on his feet.

1255
01:16:56,659 --> 01:16:58,786
Moe, Larry, Curly do the rest.

1256
01:16:58,861 --> 01:17:01,455
Fucking judges.
They're worse than cops.

1257
01:17:02,731 --> 01:17:05,097
You got the opening odds
for the Davis fight yet?

1258
01:17:05,167 --> 01:17:07,499
Ten-to-one, Davis. You playing?

1259
01:17:07,569 --> 01:17:08,695
Maybe.

1260
01:17:10,506 --> 01:17:15,068
<i>When I looked in that girl's eyes,</i>
<i>all I could see was Charlie's dad.</i>

1261
01:17:16,345 --> 01:17:21,214
<i>Meanwhile, being the fitness buff that</i>
<i>she was, Felice continued to work out.</i>

1262
01:17:21,684 --> 01:17:24,278
<i>It was important</i>
<i>that she stay in shape.</i>

1263
01:17:34,797 --> 01:17:39,257
<i>And then one night, Charlie found out</i>
<i>she had other sparring partners also.</i>

1264
01:17:51,080 --> 01:17:55,642
<i>He started to train again,</i>
<i>but not with any real purpose.</i>

1265
01:17:56,952 --> 01:17:59,352
<i>El Raton was waiting</i>
<i>with guns blazing.</i>

1266
01:18:00,222 --> 01:18:03,714
<i>I had a feeling this wasn't</i>
<i>gonna be a very pretty sight.</i>

1267
01:18:30,652 --> 01:18:33,621
-What are you doing here?
-That's some greeting.

1268
01:18:34,556 --> 01:18:36,456
I just wasn't expecting you.

1269
01:18:36,525 --> 01:18:40,586
-Can I buy you dinner, Gina?
-I don't think that's a very good idea.

1270
01:18:40,662 --> 01:18:42,186
A girl's gotta eat.

1271
01:18:43,899 --> 01:18:46,299
We missed the boat
on this one, Charlie.

1272
01:18:47,002 --> 01:18:49,493
I mean, the timing was never right.

1273
01:18:49,772 --> 01:18:52,434
You know, just different needs
at different moments.

1274
01:18:52,508 --> 01:18:55,102
It doesn't make
for the smoothest of journeys.

1275
01:18:56,512 --> 01:18:58,912
-Where's your girlfriend?
-I don't know.

1276
01:18:58,981 --> 01:19:01,677
-Where's Tiny?
-I don't know, Gina.

1277
01:19:01,917 --> 01:19:04,408
Well, shouldn't you go find them?

1278
01:19:05,154 --> 01:19:08,055
You've got a lot of
unanswered agendas floating around.

1279
01:19:08,123 --> 01:19:09,818
Why don't you go deal with them?

1280
01:19:09,892 --> 01:19:11,792
I want to do that.

1281
01:19:12,461 --> 01:19:14,759
I'm just starting here, okay?

1282
01:19:15,864 --> 01:19:17,923
Sometimes fortune
is looking down on you...

1283
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:21,492
but you don't realize it
for the trouble it's about to become.

1284
01:19:23,705 --> 01:19:27,903
I'm trying to make things right.
All I'm asking for is you to listen.

1285
01:19:31,780 --> 01:19:35,011
I'm willing to listen, but that
doesn't mean I wanna watch as well.

1286
01:19:35,084 --> 01:19:37,712
I'm not gonna be here much longer.

1287
01:19:38,087 --> 01:19:42,114
I mean, this town doesn't
encourage you to establish roots.

1288
01:19:42,658 --> 01:19:44,387
Where you running to now?

1289
01:19:44,927 --> 01:19:46,918
I'm not running anymore.

1290
01:19:48,230 --> 01:19:51,097
I mean, it's still points unknown,
but this time...

1291
01:19:51,400 --> 01:19:54,494
it's gonna be
without lights flashing behind me.

1292
01:19:54,770 --> 01:19:57,432
Sounds like what we're all looking for.

1293
01:19:59,842 --> 01:20:01,833
In one way or another.

1294
01:20:06,181 --> 01:20:09,378
-Do we have any questions out there?
-Yeah.

1295
01:20:09,451 --> 01:20:13,785
How do you respond to claims you've
not been training as hard as usual?

1296
01:20:13,856 --> 01:20:15,881
I don't respond to those claims.

1297
01:20:15,958 --> 01:20:18,722
Who's your next defense gonna be,
Charlie?

1298
01:20:18,827 --> 01:20:22,024
Each fight is a tough fight.
I take them one at a time.

1299
01:20:25,100 --> 01:20:26,226
What'd he say?

1300
01:20:26,301 --> 01:20:28,769
Ruben is furious
that Davis looks past him.

1301
01:20:28,837 --> 01:20:31,362
This is an insult to him
and to his family.

1302
01:20:31,440 --> 01:20:34,967
Let it be known that after this fight,
Ruben will be the champion...

1303
01:20:35,043 --> 01:20:37,307
and Charlie Davis will be disgraced.

1304
01:20:40,048 --> 01:20:42,312
I hope that clears it up for everyone.

1305
01:20:42,618 --> 01:20:45,109
You didn't tell me
the circus was in town.

1306
01:20:50,926 --> 01:20:54,623
Whoa! Hey! Just trying to sell tickets.
Go ahead.

1307
01:20:55,297 --> 01:20:58,357
Maybe now you'll train.
This guy's an animal, for Christ's sake.

1308
01:20:58,433 --> 01:20:59,695
What'd you tell him?

1309
01:20:59,768 --> 01:21:03,568
Exactly what you said. That Davis
called him a "son of a whore."

1310
01:21:03,872 --> 01:21:07,808
A little language misunderstanding.
We got that cleared up.

1311
01:21:09,845 --> 01:21:11,710
<i>Charlie had his wakeup call.</i>

1312
01:21:11,780 --> 01:21:14,647
<i>The only</i> q<i>uestion was</i>
<i>whether it was too late.</i>

1313
01:21:14,750 --> 01:21:17,048
<i>He started to prepare for war.</i>

1314
01:21:17,386 --> 01:21:20,878
<i>The last big rumble was</i>
<i>on the horizon, and Charlie knew it.</i>

1315
01:21:21,089 --> 01:21:24,320
<i>El Raton was hungry,</i>
<i>nasty, and desperate.</i>

1316
01:21:24,927 --> 01:21:29,455
<i>Charlie was holding the belt, and</i>
<i>it was like gold cheese to Casilios.</i>

1317
01:21:30,032 --> 01:21:32,125
<i>He was willing to kill to get it.</i>

1318
01:22:06,768 --> 01:22:10,295
You don't look like
you got much to offer tonight, Kid.

1319
01:22:10,739 --> 01:22:13,867
I messed up, Johnny.
Ain't nobody else to blame.

1320
01:22:15,210 --> 01:22:17,269
No way I dance a full card tonight.

1321
01:22:17,346 --> 01:22:20,645
Then what do you want me to do?
Go to the crowd and say it's over...

1322
01:22:20,716 --> 01:22:23,082
it's been called off,
like it rained on a picnic?

1323
01:22:23,151 --> 01:22:24,982
This guy could make me look bad.

1324
01:22:25,053 --> 01:22:27,078
And I ain't got the legs
to hunt him down.

1325
01:22:27,155 --> 01:22:28,486
Listen to me.

1326
01:22:29,157 --> 01:22:32,718
You're gonna have to take
three for one, you understand that?

1327
01:22:32,794 --> 01:22:35,422
You go there and you hit him
with everything you've got.

1328
01:22:35,497 --> 01:22:38,933
You forget anything I ever taught you,
anybody else ever taught you...

1329
01:22:39,001 --> 01:22:41,834
and you're in his face, always,
straight ahead.

1330
01:22:41,903 --> 01:22:45,532
Every time he looks up, he gets hit.
You understand that?

1331
01:22:46,174 --> 01:22:49,507
'Cause if this goes the distance,
you don't have a chance.

1332
01:22:52,281 --> 01:22:55,216
He wants the belt,
let him come and get it.

1333
01:23:04,393 --> 01:23:05,655
Let's get him.

1334
01:23:05,861 --> 01:23:09,228
<i>Robin, there's some question</i>
<i>about the champion. He's a little soft.</i>

1335
01:23:09,298 --> 01:23:10,925
<i>That's the word in the training camp.</i>

1336
01:23:10,999 --> 01:23:14,196
<i>We've heard that rumor here,</i>
<i>and I doubt that and I'll tell you why.</i>

1337
01:23:14,269 --> 01:23:17,432
<i>We saw one of the strangest things</i>
<i>I've ever seen in a fight camp.</i>

1338
01:23:17,506 --> 01:23:20,805
<i>We saw the champ getting in</i>
<i>an elevator, he pulled up his shirt...</i>

1339
01:23:20,876 --> 01:23:23,367
<i>and showed us</i>
<i>a very rippled midsection, and said:</i>

1340
01:23:23,445 --> 01:23:26,346
<i>"Does this look like I haven't done</i>
<i>enough sit-ups?"</i>

1341
01:23:34,890 --> 01:23:36,858
<i>I don't know,</i>
<i>there's some body-punching.</i>

1342
01:23:36,925 --> 01:23:38,517
<i>You've got thunderous punching.</i>

1343
01:23:38,593 --> 01:23:40,959
<i>And there was the fight</i>
<i>in the press conference.</i>

1344
01:23:41,029 --> 01:23:42,963
<i>It's hard to say</i>
<i>how much of this is pomp.</i>

1345
01:23:43,031 --> 01:23:46,899
<i>But certainly there's nationalism</i>
<i>involved. There's lot of pride involved.</i>

1346
01:23:46,968 --> 01:23:49,402
<i>We're in Reno,</i>
<i>but it looks like Mexico here tonight.</i>

1347
01:23:49,471 --> 01:23:51,405
<i>A lot of people</i>
<i>have made the trip to town.</i>

1348
01:23:51,473 --> 01:23:53,338
<i>The whole mix-up is over respect.</i>

1349
01:23:53,408 --> 01:23:57,469
<i>We'll see if the champion or</i>
<i>the challenger gets it when it's over.</i>

1350
01:23:57,546 --> 01:23:58,706
<i>This is gonna be good one.</i>

1351
01:23:58,780 --> 01:24:00,645
<i>Eldorado Hotel Casino</i>
<i>in Reno, Nevada...</i>

1352
01:24:00,716 --> 01:24:04,208
<i>is proud to present your main event</i>
<i>of the evening.</i>

1353
01:24:04,586 --> 01:24:09,523
<i>Twelve rounds of boxing for the</i>
<i>Welterweight Championship.</i>

1354
01:24:11,526 --> 01:24:13,756
<i>First, introducing the challenger.</i>

1355
01:24:13,829 --> 01:24:16,559
<i>Hailing from Huapago, Mexico...</i>

1356
01:24:16,631 --> 01:24:20,897
<i>Reuben "El Raton" Casilios!</i>

1357
01:24:23,038 --> 01:24:25,529
<i>And the champion,</i>
<i>out of the blue corner.</i>

1358
01:24:25,707 --> 01:24:29,006
<i>He weighs in 145 pounds of fury.</i>

1359
01:24:29,211 --> 01:24:31,611
<i>Also a perfect record at 30 and 0.</i>

1360
01:24:31,680 --> 01:24:32,772
<i>Please welcome...</i>

1361
01:24:32,848 --> 01:24:37,785
<i>Charlie "The Kid" Davis!</i>

1362
01:24:44,326 --> 01:24:46,260
Gentlemen,
I've given you instructions...

1363
01:24:46,328 --> 01:24:49,456
prior to this fight
in your respective dressing rooms.

1364
01:24:49,631 --> 01:24:51,758
Any questions from the challenger?

1365
01:24:52,134 --> 01:24:54,159
Any questions from the champion?

1366
01:24:54,603 --> 01:24:57,128
Touch gloves,
and good luck to both of you.

1367
01:25:03,178 --> 01:25:04,702
Yeah, sure, thanks.

1368
01:25:09,584 --> 01:25:11,176
<i>Here's the bell for Round 1.</i>

1369
01:25:11,253 --> 01:25:14,154
<i>"El Raton" Reuben Casilios,</i>
<i>is in the green trunks...</i>

1370
01:25:14,222 --> 01:25:17,817
<i>World Champion, Charlie "The Kid"</i>
<i>Davis trying to keep his momentum.</i>

1371
01:25:17,893 --> 01:25:19,121
<i>He's been a great champion...</i>

1372
01:25:19,194 --> 01:25:22,357
<i>but some have said it's been</i>
<i>a soft training camp here in Reno.</i>

1373
01:25:22,431 --> 01:25:25,264
What are you dancing for?
Murder the bastard!

1374
01:25:25,700 --> 01:25:28,999
<i>We're not seeing the typical</i>
q<i>uick start of Charlie "The Kid" Davis.</i>

1375
01:25:29,070 --> 01:25:30,662
<i>The fact is, Reuben Casilios....</i>

1376
01:25:30,739 --> 01:25:32,764
Get off the ropes! Off the ropes!

1377
01:25:32,841 --> 01:25:36,834
<i>Charlie Davis has not fared well</i>
<i>in his career against the ropes.</i>

1378
01:25:39,147 --> 01:25:42,048
<i>Casilios, good right-hand,</i>
<i>good left-hand combination...</i>

1379
01:25:42,117 --> 01:25:44,517
<i>has Davis in trouble here in Round 1.</i>

1380
01:25:44,986 --> 01:25:47,477
<i>Maybe it's the new polka dot trunks</i>
<i>of Davis...</i>

1381
01:25:47,556 --> 01:25:51,356
<i>he doesn't seem to have the energy,</i>
<i>but he is getting pummeled here.</i>

1382
01:25:54,529 --> 01:25:56,997
<i>Davis trying to bicycle his way</i>
<i>out of the corner.</i>

1383
01:25:57,065 --> 01:25:59,329
Off the ropes!

1384
01:25:59,401 --> 01:26:01,961
<i>Near the end of Round 1</i>
<i>Casilios still on the attack.</i>

1385
01:26:02,037 --> 01:26:03,561
<i>He's got Davis against the ropes.</i>

1386
01:26:03,638 --> 01:26:07,165
<i>The fans are going crazy. They may</i>
<i>see the upset of the century.</i>

1387
01:26:12,047 --> 01:26:14,447
What the hell are you doing in there?

1388
01:26:15,083 --> 01:26:18,109
You're gonna lose everything.
You ain't that good. Never!

1389
01:26:18,186 --> 01:26:19,983
Nobody was that good, ever!

1390
01:26:22,858 --> 01:26:26,817
You just keep yourself going!
Keep your mind in the ring!

1391
01:26:39,975 --> 01:26:43,240
<i>Charlie came out in the second round</i>
<i>like a man possessed...</i>

1392
01:26:43,378 --> 01:26:45,437
<i>but The Rat refused to yield.</i>

1393
01:26:45,547 --> 01:26:48,641
<i>I felt the pain of every shot</i>
<i>Charlie was taking.</i>

1394
01:27:40,769 --> 01:27:42,703
<i>The third round. Here comes Charlie.</i>

1395
01:27:42,771 --> 01:27:44,432
<i>Round 3 brought more of the same...</i>

1396
01:27:44,506 --> 01:27:48,101
<i>with Charlie valiantly trying to hang in</i>
<i>against this wild man.</i>

1397
01:27:48,176 --> 01:27:51,668
<i>Raton battered Charlie</i>
<i>against the ropes, and sent him down.</i>

1398
01:27:52,013 --> 01:27:53,674
<i>I couldn't stand back anymore.</i>

1399
01:27:53,748 --> 01:27:57,650
<i>He needed me. And</i> q<i>uite possibly,</i>
<i>I needed him even more.</i>

1400
01:27:57,719 --> 01:28:01,519
Get out of the way! Charlie! Get up!

1401
01:28:04,726 --> 01:28:07,786
<i>Tiny O'Toole, longtime cornerman.</i>
<i>We haven't seen him in a while.</i>

1402
01:28:07,862 --> 01:28:09,386
Eight, nine.

1403
01:28:11,933 --> 01:28:14,197
All right, give me a stool.

1404
01:28:16,705 --> 01:28:18,798
Okay, Charlie.

1405
01:28:19,908 --> 01:28:21,899
Come on, that's it. You can do it.

1406
01:28:23,912 --> 01:28:25,846
Tiny, remember back in the Gloves?

1407
01:28:26,281 --> 01:28:29,216
They jobbed us in the finals,
triple pricks.

1408
01:28:29,284 --> 01:28:31,878
-Not tonight, Charlie.
-They robbed us blind.

1409
01:28:31,953 --> 01:28:35,719
What are you, delirious?
Get your head in the fight, Charlie!

1410
01:28:36,224 --> 01:28:38,215
This ain't going to the judges.

1411
01:28:38,293 --> 01:28:41,785
I swear to God, one way or the other,
this ends now.

1412
01:28:41,896 --> 01:28:44,262
Listen. You don't need
to hold anything back.

1413
01:28:44,332 --> 01:28:47,597
Come with the hook, and then
come over the top with the right.

1414
01:28:47,669 --> 01:28:49,534
You got time to finish this.

1415
01:28:49,604 --> 01:28:51,094
I'm all out of time.

1416
01:28:52,674 --> 01:28:55,541
One more round, Tiny, we go home.

1417
01:28:56,711 --> 01:29:00,203
This is for your father.
This is for Gene, okay?

1418
01:29:01,249 --> 01:29:02,876
Give me the mouthpiece.

1419
01:29:04,819 --> 01:29:06,650
Kick his fucking ass.

1420
01:29:07,722 --> 01:29:09,587
<i>Round 4, ready to go.</i>

1421
01:29:09,658 --> 01:29:13,424
<i>El Raton, Reuben Casilios, full of</i>
<i>confidence, he can't wait to get there.</i>

1422
01:29:13,495 --> 01:29:14,689
<i>Charlie "The Kid" Davis.</i>

1423
01:29:14,763 --> 01:29:16,924
<i>Could this be the end</i>
<i>of a great career?</i>

1424
01:29:16,998 --> 01:29:20,058
<i>The fans have not sat down</i>
<i>since the middle of the third round.</i>

1425
01:29:20,135 --> 01:29:22,126
<i>Casilios pressing the action again.</i>

1426
01:29:22,203 --> 01:29:24,103
<i>Has the Kid in trouble</i>
<i>against the ropes.</i>

1427
01:29:24,172 --> 01:29:27,141
<i>Casilios looking for that big shot.</i>
<i>Trying to load up.</i>

1428
01:29:27,208 --> 01:29:30,041
<i>He senses the win. Here it is.</i>
<i>He misses. Back comes Davis.</i>

1429
01:29:30,111 --> 01:29:31,806
<i>The left hand thwacks Casilios.</i>

1430
01:29:31,880 --> 01:29:33,347
That's it! Yes, Charlie!

1431
01:29:33,415 --> 01:29:36,282
<i>Lightning strikes right here</i>
<i>in Reno, Nevada!</i>

1432
01:29:36,718 --> 01:29:39,050
Come on, baby, get it over quick!

1433
01:29:39,387 --> 01:29:42,720
<i>...punishes Casilios with a left hook.</i>
<i>Casilios says he's not hurt.</i>

1434
01:29:42,791 --> 01:29:44,725
<i>He pushes the referee out of the way.</i>

1435
01:29:44,793 --> 01:29:48,285
<i>Referee lets them fight again.</i>
<i>And back comes Davis.</i>

1436
01:29:49,497 --> 01:29:51,727
Yes, Charlie!

1437
01:29:51,800 --> 01:29:53,267
<i>Casilios in big trouble!</i>

1438
01:29:53,334 --> 01:29:54,767
Way to go, Charlie!

1439
01:29:54,836 --> 01:29:56,303
<i>And the champion is back!</i>

1440
01:29:56,371 --> 01:29:58,396
Break his heart, Charlie!

1441
01:30:14,489 --> 01:30:16,582
Yes, Charlie!

1442
01:30:19,627 --> 01:30:21,185
Stay down.

1443
01:30:22,864 --> 01:30:26,459
...seven, eight, nine, ten.

1444
01:30:31,673 --> 01:30:34,164
You did it, Charlie! You did it!

1445
01:30:35,210 --> 01:30:38,407
Charlie, I love you!

1446
01:30:39,314 --> 01:30:42,613
<i>By knockout, at 1:57...</i>

1447
01:30:42,684 --> 01:30:46,142
<i>and still the Welterweight Champion</i>
<i>of the World...</i>

1448
01:30:46,221 --> 01:30:49,520
<i>Charlie "The Kid" Davis.</i>

1449
01:30:54,662 --> 01:30:58,564
Attaboy, Charlie!
This is just the beginning.

1450
01:30:58,633 --> 01:31:01,625
We'll let those wounds heal,
we'll let those feelings dry up...

1451
01:31:01,703 --> 01:31:04,035
then we're gonna sit down
and talk about the future.

1452
01:31:04,105 --> 01:31:07,268
The way I'm gonna take care of you.
You can trust me on that one.

1453
01:31:07,342 --> 01:31:09,936
That's it, Dumas. I'm through.

1454
01:31:13,414 --> 01:31:16,713
Where you gonna go? It's not like
you got a choice in any of this.

1455
01:31:16,785 --> 01:31:19,083
What are you gonna do, kill me?

1456
01:31:20,755 --> 01:31:22,689
Don't you know everybody dies?

1457
01:31:23,658 --> 01:31:24,955
Everybody dies.

1458
01:31:32,667 --> 01:31:35,431
Yeah, Champion of the World.

1459
01:31:36,371 --> 01:31:40,307
<i>Felice tried to slip Charlie</i>
<i>some sort of verbal business card...</i>

1460
01:31:40,375 --> 01:31:42,707
<i>but he was no longer interested.</i>

1461
01:31:43,144 --> 01:31:47,137
<i>I realized then that Gina</i>
<i>was not after his money or his fame.</i>

1462
01:31:48,049 --> 01:31:52,281
<i>She was in love with the same things</i>
<i>America had grown smitten with.</i>

1463
01:31:53,054 --> 01:31:57,582
<i>His heart, his passion,</i>
<i>his unwillingness to surrender.</i>

1464
01:31:58,293 --> 01:32:00,761
<i>And in the end, most importantly...</i>

1465
01:32:01,262 --> 01:32:02,627
<i>body and soul.</i>
