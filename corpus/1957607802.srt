the same thing.

Well, you didn't have to
make a scene.

Well, Sam, maybe we should
make a scene!

post something about it.

You never even liked her.

Yeah, she was annoying
but we were friends.

she was murdered?

[Riley]
Do they know who did it?

120
00:08:47,386 --> 00:08:49,655
No, but it's probably one of
those assholes she dates.

121
00:08:50,156 --> 00:08:51,991
She dated two consecutive
psychos freshman year.

122
00:08:52,024 --> 00:08:53,259
She had to call the cops
on one of them.

Does it say?

00:08:55,194 --> 00:08:56,796
[Heather] No, but I bet
that's what it was.

00:08:57,531 --> 00:08:58,597
Fuck.

126
00:08:59,732 --> 00:09:02,435
I mean, at some point,
you kind of expect it.

00:09:03,869 --> 00:09:04,970
What?

128
00:09:05,704 --> 00:09:07,773
I mean, like,
she would always go to bars

129
00:09:07,807 --> 00:09:09,575
and look for
the biggest psycho there

130
00:09:09,608 --> 00:09:11,444
and hook up with him
just for attention.

131
00:09:12,111 --> 00:09:14,146
- So you're saying she deserved it?
- No!

132

No, I'm just sayin'.

133
00:09:16,248 --> 00:09:18,484

But is it always this hot?

144

[Riley] Oh,
please don't complain the whole time.

Does anyone need sunscreen?

Frickin' fried last year.

you brought your inhaler.

152
00:10:47,039 --> 00:10:49,341
when you dragged us to Star Trek
freshman year.

153
00:10:49,543 --> 00:10:51,510

- [laughing]

155
00:10:53,445 --> 00:10:55,649

That was rough.

156
00:10:55,681 --> 00:10:57,816

it is very hot,

161
00:11:23,042 --> 00:11:25,744
and we're about half a mile in

- Right guys?
- [Riley] Mm.

163
00:11:27,746 --> 00:11:29,215
Are you gonna do that
the whole time?

164
00:11:29,348 --> 00:11:31,651
- Do what?
- Make those videos.

165
00:11:32,151 --> 00:11:33,553
Not the whole time,
but, yeah.

166

You're so into this influencer stuff
now, aren't you?

Okay, hey, it pays the bills.

168
00:11:38,692 --> 00:11:41,360
There's a skincare product line
that literally pays me $100

169

- just to use their stuff.
- Oh, high roller!

170
00:11:44,430 --> 00:11:46,398
Do you even like the products
you're promoting?

171
00:11:46,432 --> 00:11:48,467
Sometimes, but, hey,

172
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:50,836
it's better than that weed store
you work at.

173
00:11:50,936 --> 00:11:53,239
It was a medical marijuana
dispensary.

174
00:11:54,608 --> 00:11:56,909
- Speaking of which...
- Oh, no. No, no no, not for me.

175
00:11:57,009 --> 00:11:59,679
- Should we repeat last year's adventure?
- Oh, God.

176
00:12:00,012 --> 00:12:01,548
- Sam!
- No.

177
00:12:02,414 --> 00:12:03,916
Wait. I don't want to
do it alone.

178
00:12:03,949 --> 00:12:06,151
Nope. That shit
makes me feel weird.

179
00:12:06,852 --> 00:12:08,020
Sammy?

180
00:12:09,188 --> 00:12:10,489
Maybe later.

181
00:12:11,357 --> 00:12:13,225
[Riley]
[sighs] Okay. Fine.

182
00:12:13,727 --> 00:12:15,160
I'm just gonna take one.

183
00:12:15,194 --> 00:12:16,563
I thought you were quitting?

184
00:12:17,496 --> 00:12:19,164
No. Definitely not.

185
00:12:19,198 --> 00:12:20,667
They're gonna let
your stoner ass

186
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:21,967
bring that shit to Senegal?

187
00:12:22,535 --> 00:12:24,169
- Probably not.
- [chuckling]

188
00:12:24,203 --> 00:12:25,804
Gotta make the most of it.

189
00:12:26,972 --> 00:12:28,807
What about you, Sam,
do you still smoke at all?

190
00:12:29,208 --> 00:12:30,843
Sometimes,
but it makes me paranoid.

191
00:12:31,143 --> 00:12:32,311
Oh, my God.

192
00:12:33,178 --> 00:12:35,447
I remember when
I gave you two edibles,

193
00:12:35,682 --> 00:12:38,551
and you locked yourself in the
bathroom for, like, three hours.

194
00:12:38,585 --> 00:12:40,352
- [laughing]
- [Sam] It was not three hours.

195
00:12:40,386 --> 00:12:42,955
- [Heather] Oh, my God.
- [Riley] Yes, it was. We were all worried.

196
00:12:42,988 --> 00:12:44,790
But Sam's always been
a scaredy-cat.

197
00:12:44,823 --> 00:12:47,259
That's probably why she took all
those fighting classes last year.

198
00:12:47,527 --> 00:12:49,629
Uh, no.
That was because of Ralph.

199
00:12:53,533 --> 00:12:55,968
Um, have you heard from him
recently?

200
00:12:56,569 --> 00:12:59,271
No, the restraining order
shut him up, funnily enough.

201
00:13:01,373 --> 00:13:03,142
- He was a nightmare.
- Yep.

202
00:13:04,644 --> 00:13:06,011
Is he still in that apartment?

203
00:13:07,647 --> 00:13:10,282
[sighs]
His parents made him move.

204
00:13:10,684 --> 00:13:12,851
And then he started seeing
a therapist or something

205
00:13:12,885 --> 00:13:15,220
and now he's in Denver,
at least that's what I heard.

206
00:13:15,354 --> 00:13:17,724
[Heather] Well, at least he's
not bothering you anymore.

207
00:13:18,324 --> 00:13:19,391
[Sam] Yep.

208
00:13:21,661 --> 00:13:23,797
[Heather] Have I mentioned
how fucking hot it is?

209
00:13:23,829 --> 00:13:26,465
[Sam] Oh, my God! This is why
we called you "Heat."

210
00:13:27,399 --> 00:13:29,168
[Heather]
No. No, no, no, no, no.

211
00:13:29,201 --> 00:13:30,936
They... You guys called me heat

212
00:13:30,969 --> 00:13:34,273
because those boys freshman year
thought I was a "smoke show."

213
00:13:34,306 --> 00:13:36,442
[Riley]
[scoffs] Oh, my God, no!

214
00:13:36,576 --> 00:13:38,444
They called you Heat because
you used to

215
00:13:38,477 --> 00:13:40,412
sweat through your shirt
at every party.

216
00:13:40,446 --> 00:13:42,047
[Heather] Bullshit!

217
00:13:42,081 --> 00:13:44,083
[Riley] No, that's definitely
what is was. Right, Sam?

218
00:13:44,116 --> 00:13:45,484
[Sam] I don't remember.

219
00:13:45,517 --> 00:13:47,119
[Riley] No, that... that's it.

220
00:13:47,152 --> 00:13:48,220
Yeah.

221
00:13:51,957 --> 00:13:54,960
[♪]

222
00:14:10,810 --> 00:14:12,211

[♪]

224
00:15:15,374 --> 00:15:16,975
[Heather] You guys.

225
00:15:17,242 --> 00:15:18,377
Let's stop for a sec.

226
00:15:21,915 --> 00:15:24,016
I think this place
gets hotter every year.

227
00:15:25,384 --> 00:15:26,920
Fucking global warming.

228
00:15:26,952 --> 00:15:28,454
I bet you that guy at
the gas station

229
00:15:28,487 --> 00:15:29,656
doesn't even believe in it.

230
00:15:31,023 --> 00:15:33,025
Do either of you guys have
a portable charger?

231
00:15:33,325 --> 00:15:34,627
Yeah. I got you.

232
00:15:40,567 --> 00:15:41,634
Thanks.

233
00:15:42,769 --> 00:15:45,170
Damn. You get really good
reception out here.

234
00:15:49,141 --> 00:15:50,375
[phone chimes]

235
00:15:51,611 --> 00:15:53,880
- That's weird.
- What?

236
00:15:54,346 --> 00:15:56,482
Just got a DM,
"I see you."

237
00:15:56,649 --> 00:15:57,784
From who?

238
00:15:59,184 --> 00:16:00,854
[Riley] That can't be
the first time.

239
00:16:00,954 --> 00:16:03,656
Don't you have, like,
15,000 followers now?

240
00:16:03,890 --> 00:16:06,860
17,000, and yeah,
I get weirdos all the time.

241
00:16:08,026 --> 00:16:10,964
- He sent a pic, too.
- Ew. Delete it.

242
00:16:10,996 --> 00:16:13,031
No, no, no,
just one of the woods.

243
00:16:16,769 --> 00:16:17,937
[Sam] Where is that?

244
00:16:18,571 --> 00:16:20,272
[Heather] I don't know.
Looks like here.

245
00:16:21,273 --> 00:16:23,610
That's weird. Did he say
anything else?

246
00:16:24,076 --> 00:16:25,310
Nope.

247
00:16:25,812 --> 00:16:27,346
Fuck off, creep.

248
00:16:27,814 --> 00:16:29,281
It's probably just some weirdo.

249
00:16:29,314 --> 00:16:31,951
I get weird messages from
creepy dudes all the time.

250
00:16:32,685 --> 00:16:34,186
Well, at least it wasn't
a dick pic.

251
00:16:34,219 --> 00:16:36,154
Oh, I can make
a coffee table book

252
00:16:36,188 --> 00:16:38,156
- with all those that I've gotten.
- [chuckles] Oh, my God.

253
00:16:39,157 --> 00:16:41,561
- Do you guys think...
- What?

254
00:16:42,729 --> 00:16:45,097
No, it's probably just some
weirdo that saw my story.

255
00:16:45,598 --> 00:16:47,567
- But how would they...
- What?

256
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:49,268
[Riley] No. Fuck that.

257
00:16:49,301 --> 00:16:51,203
We're not gonna let some creep
ruin our trip.

258
00:16:51,236 --> 00:16:53,006
[Heather]
That's the fuckin' spirit.

259
00:16:53,038 --> 00:16:54,674
[chuckling]

260
00:16:58,510 --> 00:16:59,812
[Riley] Just gets
heavier and heavier.

261
00:16:59,846 --> 00:17:02,281
[Heather]
Hotter and hotter.

262
00:17:04,984 --> 00:17:06,553
Okay, it's time.

263
00:17:10,023 --> 00:17:11,256
[Riley] Oh, God.

264
00:17:12,157 --> 00:17:13,425
[Heather] Hello!

<i>Hi, Riley.</i>

269
00:17:27,941 --> 00:17:30,275
<i>And my other best, Sam.</i>

00:17:31,443 --> 00:17:33,111
- <i>Hi.</i>
- [laughs]

271
00:17:33,145 --> 00:17:34,847
<i>They're really happy,
you just can't tell.</i>

272
00:17:36,683 --> 00:17:39,251
<i>Okay, mile four,</i>

273
00:17:39,284 --> 00:17:41,688
<i>and we're really starting
to feel the heat.</i>

274
00:17:41,721 --> 00:17:43,590
<i>How are you doing, Riley?</i>

275
00:17:43,623 --> 00:17:45,090
<i>My sports bra...</i>

276
00:17:45,123 --> 00:17:47,961
<i>Mile five down.</i>

<i>My girl Slam
lookin' fine as always.</i>

<i>Mile six and we're takin'
a little break.</i>

279
00:17:55,434 --> 00:17:57,235
<i>Sam is havin' a little nap.</i>

280
00:17:57,269 --> 00:17:58,738
- [Sam] <i>Fuck off.</i>
- <i>Ooh!</i>

281
00:18:00,006 --> 00:18:03,241
- [Heather] <i>How is that?</i>
- <i>This apple?</i>

282
00:18:03,275 --> 00:18:04,677
<i>The best apple
I think I've ever had.</i>

283
00:18:04,711 --> 00:18:06,144
- [Heather] <i>Ever had?</i>
- [Riley] <i>Mm-hm.</i>

- [radio beeps]
- Hey, uh,

289
00:18:37,476 --> 00:18:39,679
how many hunting licenses
did we give out this season?

290
00:18:40,780 --> 00:18:42,849
[man]
<i>Uh, 20, I think.</i>

291
00:18:44,617 --> 00:18:47,486
We give out any, uh, like,
crossbow hunting licenses?

292
00:18:48,821 --> 00:18:50,522
<i>Bow hunting?</i>

293
00:18:50,556 --> 00:18:52,592
<i>No, not that I know of.
Why?</i>

294
00:18:53,826 --> 00:18:55,460
Yeah, you might want to call
the county.

295
00:18:55,494 --> 00:18:58,131
We could have
a poaching situation.

296
00:18:58,163 --> 00:19:00,033
<i>Is he hunting
or just target practice?</i>

297
00:19:04,037 --> 00:19:06,806
Yeah, it might just be
target practice.

298
00:19:07,439 --> 00:19:08,608
But I'll ask him.

299
00:19:10,242 --> 00:19:11,811

and let me know.</i>

- Fuck.

Yeah, this is it.

Why is it so dry?

316
00:20:37,997 --> 00:20:39,766
Climate change, that's why.

Less snowfall means less water.

Fucking bullshit.

Oh, that's fucking weird.

Did you see his face?
It looked like he's wearing a mask.

337
00:22:30,910 --> 00:22:32,712
A mask? Looks like a hat.

338
00:22:32,945 --> 00:22:34,647
He's fucking creepy.

Hey, my phone's on low.
Do you have the phone charger?

Oh, great.

- Nope.

00:22:57,770 --> 00:22:59,672
Maybe you shouldn't do that.
Isn't your phone gonna die?

349
00:22:59,705 --> 00:23:01,007
I'm gonna use this for stories.

350
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:02,507
We can use Sam's
for emergencies.

351
00:23:05,443 --> 00:23:08,981
Hello, here we are
at mile... seven?

352
00:23:09,015 --> 00:23:10,917
- Seven and a half.
- Seven and a half,

353
00:23:10,950 --> 00:23:13,953
and we've made it to this once
beautiful, beautiful oasis

354
00:23:13,986 --> 00:23:16,589
that is now
a giant pit of despair.

355
00:23:16,622 --> 00:23:18,758
But it's okay, 'cause I'm still
with my gorgeous friends.

356
00:23:18,791 --> 00:23:20,559
- Say hi, Sam.
- Can you not right now?

357
00:23:20,593 --> 00:23:21,861
Okay, well...

358
00:23:22,261 --> 00:23:23,428
You just ruined it.

359
00:23:26,498 --> 00:23:29,001
Hello! Here we are
at mile seven and a half,

360
00:23:29,035 --> 00:23:30,703
and we're at what used to be

361
00:23:30,736 --> 00:23:32,772
the most gorgeous,
gorgeous oasis,

362
00:23:32,805 --> 00:23:34,774
that is now
a giant pit of despair.

363
00:23:34,807 --> 00:23:36,609
But I'm with
my gorgeous friends,

364
00:23:36,642 --> 00:23:38,978
and Riley just ruined
my phone charger,

365
00:23:39,011 --> 00:23:40,980
so I'm a little bit upset
about that,

366
00:23:41,013 --> 00:23:42,548
and might be off the grid later.

367
00:23:42,682 --> 00:23:45,918
But, good news is,
we're only about three...

368
00:23:45,952 --> 00:23:47,620
- Three miles.
- Three miles

369
00:23:47,653 --> 00:23:50,156
until we get to our
favorite spot to camp

370
00:23:50,189 --> 00:23:51,857
where someday,
people will build

371
00:23:51,891 --> 00:23:53,726
a giant statue of
the three of us,

372
00:23:53,759 --> 00:23:56,929
and it will be bronze
and it will be beautiful.

373
00:24:00,066 --> 00:24:01,133
Okay, let's go.

374
00:24:10,242 --> 00:24:12,311
[Heather] Okay, I don't care
if the lake is dry,

375
00:24:12,345 --> 00:24:14,714
we are still getting
a fucking picture.

376
00:24:15,414 --> 00:24:17,049
[Riley]
Oh, Heather is serious.

377
00:24:17,083 --> 00:24:18,617
She's brining out the tripod.

378
00:24:18,651 --> 00:24:20,853
How else are we gonna get
a picture of the three of us?

379
00:24:21,620 --> 00:24:23,589
Is that what this is all for,
the picture?

380
00:24:24,457 --> 00:24:25,925
No.

381
00:24:26,392 --> 00:24:27,893
No, Sam.

382
00:24:27,927 --> 00:24:29,462
It's for the stories, too.

383
00:24:29,662 --> 00:24:31,664
It's gonna take three.
It's gonna take in five seconds.

384
00:24:31,697 --> 00:24:32,898
Hurry up, guys.

385
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,201
Come on, come on, come on.

Oh, my God, yes. One of these
is definitely post-able.

I can't believe

00:26:11,497 --> 00:26:12,932
you guys remember that song.

417
00:26:13,666 --> 00:26:15,835
Didn't we make it up
at that freshman year...

418
00:26:15,868 --> 00:26:17,571
we were at that frat house?

419
00:26:17,603 --> 00:26:20,106
[Sam] Oh, yeah, you were
super ill in the bathroom.

420
00:26:20,139 --> 00:26:22,741
- [laughing]
- We were just trying to cheer you up,

421
00:26:23,109 --> 00:26:25,277
made up that stupid song,

422
00:26:25,845 --> 00:26:28,247
and the next thing we know,
the whole house is singing it.

423
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:29,648
[chuckles]

424
00:26:29,815 --> 00:26:31,217

We should all get a tattoo.

[Heather] On our asses.
[chuckles]

426
00:26:32,852 --> 00:26:34,186
That's the last thing
we should do

427
00:26:34,220 --> 00:26:35,321
before you guys leave.

428
00:26:36,188 --> 00:26:37,389
When do you leave, Sam?

429
00:26:37,523 --> 00:26:39,425
[Sam] Uh, my flight
is booked for the 28th.

430
00:26:40,693 --> 00:26:42,061
What about you, Riley?

431
00:26:43,095 --> 00:26:44,196
[Riley] Twenty-ninth.

00:26:44,864 --> 00:26:45,931
[Heather] Fuck.

433
00:26:46,866 --> 00:26:48,834
[Riley] Yeah.
End of an era.

00:26:48,968 --> 00:26:50,136
[Sam] Yep.

435
00:26:51,237 --> 00:26:53,105
You guys gotta visit me, though.
Both of you.

Senegal?

439
00:27:00,079 --> 00:27:02,848
[Riley] No. I mean,
they give us time off.

440
00:27:03,249 --> 00:27:06,152
We could, like, meet up in...

441
00:27:06,185 --> 00:27:07,621
Germany?

442
00:27:07,653 --> 00:27:09,955
- [Heather] Oh, fuck yeah, Germany.
- [laughing]

443
00:27:09,989 --> 00:27:12,491
So, what kind of stuff are you
gonna be doing in Senegal?

444
00:27:13,159 --> 00:27:14,960
- Lots of building.
- [whimpering]

445
00:27:14,994 --> 00:27:17,429
Uh, creating fresh,
clean water sources.

446
00:27:17,763 --> 00:27:20,032
We're gonna be working with
schools and hospitals.

00:27:23,537 --> 00:27:24,670
He's back.

450
00:27:28,274 --> 00:27:30,009
Oh, come on.
This guy again!

451
00:27:31,310 --> 00:27:33,613
Heather, you should probably flash him.
That's what he wants.

452
00:27:34,013 --> 00:27:35,481
Hey, asshole!

453
00:27:35,514 --> 00:27:38,150
You think you're real cute
with your creeper camo act?

454
00:27:38,350 --> 00:27:40,620
I want you to know that
my girl, Sam, here

455
00:27:40,654 --> 00:27:42,321
is a kickboxing badass,

456
00:27:42,354 --> 00:27:45,324
and she has her black belt in
beating up creeps like you.

457
00:27:45,357 --> 00:27:47,059
So if you come any closer,

458
00:27:47,092 --> 00:27:49,461
you're leading yourself into
a world of pain.

459
00:27:58,938 --> 00:28:00,574
Kickboxing badass?

460
00:28:00,773 --> 00:28:02,074
It's all about perception.

[phone chimes]

462
00:28:07,179 --> 00:28:10,416
Oh, that's real cute!
Yeah, we're so scared.

463
00:28:10,449 --> 00:28:13,185
Lotta balls on a guy
to message a girl anonymously.

464
00:28:13,485 --> 00:28:15,154
[Riley]
That's fucking creepy.

465
00:28:16,188 --> 00:28:17,691
Blocked.

466
00:28:17,723 --> 00:28:20,726
And that's how you deal with
a creeper asshole, ladies.

467
00:28:20,759 --> 00:28:22,828
- [chuckles]
- You should have filmed that.

468
00:28:22,861 --> 00:28:25,030
That was the most interesting
thing you've done all day.

469
00:28:25,064 --> 00:28:26,398
- [laughs]
- Shit! You're right.

470
00:28:26,432 --> 00:28:27,866
You think he'll do it again?

[thwack]

472
00:28:32,938 --> 00:28:34,807
What the fuck!
That could have hit us.

Hey, motherfucker,
that wasn't fucking funny!

474
00:28:38,310 --> 00:28:39,979

00:28:41,981 --> 00:28:44,116
[Heather] Swear to God,
I'll kill you if I see you again,

477
00:28:44,149 --> 00:28:46,720

That was fucking bullshit,

- You're right.
- No, that could have hit us.

482
00:29:19,485 --> 00:29:21,053
It was two feet from Sam's head.

483
00:29:21,453 --> 00:29:23,355
But you scared him off.
He's gone now.

484
00:29:23,389 --> 00:29:24,890
We have to go back to Sam.

485
00:29:25,692 --> 00:29:26,859
Come on.

486
00:29:30,229 --> 00:29:32,331
[Sam] Okay, I think
we need to head back.

487
00:29:32,364 --> 00:29:35,200
What? Head back just because of
this asshole creep?

488
00:29:35,735 --> 00:29:37,336
He shot an arrow at us.

489
00:29:37,369 --> 00:29:39,104
Well, it wasn't at us.

490
00:29:39,138 --> 00:29:40,973
Are you kidding me?
It was right there.

491
00:29:45,811 --> 00:29:47,846
It's gonna get dark soon.
We should head back.

492
00:29:48,514 --> 00:29:50,883
I don't think we're gonna
make it to the car before dark.

493
00:29:51,751 --> 00:29:53,185
Can we call a cop or something?

494
00:29:53,485 --> 00:29:55,555
Fuck the cops,
they're not gonna come out here.

495
00:29:55,954 --> 00:29:57,823
We should just call
the forest service,

496
00:29:57,856 --> 00:30:00,627
and tell them there's a guy
that's shooting arrows at hikers.

497
00:30:02,027 --> 00:30:03,062
Okay.

498
00:30:04,029 --> 00:30:05,230
I'm at ten percent.

499
00:30:05,264 --> 00:30:06,700
I'm at 14. I can call.

Hi, um, me and two of my friends
have been hiking on...

503
00:30:20,346 --> 00:30:22,247
- [Riley] The Bennet Trail for a while.
- On the Bennet Trail,

504
00:30:22,281 --> 00:30:24,983
and we would... we would like to
report that somebody just shot at us.

505
00:30:25,184 --> 00:30:26,653
You were shot at?

506
00:30:26,686 --> 00:30:28,420
<i>Yes. We think you should
send a ranger.</i>

507
00:30:29,288 --> 00:30:30,757
Wait. Someone shot at you
with a gun?

508
00:30:31,390 --> 00:30:34,159
No, um, with an arrow.

509
00:30:34,193 --> 00:30:35,361
<i>An arrow?
Is anyone hurt?</i>

510
00:30:36,161 --> 00:30:38,364
No, he missed us.
He... He wasn't aiming at us.

511
00:30:38,397 --> 00:30:40,734
But can you please
just send a ranger?

512
00:30:40,767 --> 00:30:41,801
<i>So wait.</i>

513
00:30:42,368 --> 00:30:44,002
Nobody was hurt.

514
00:30:44,036 --> 00:30:46,171
<i>No, but...</i>

515
00:30:46,205 --> 00:30:47,540
<i>he was trying to hurt us.</i>

516
00:30:47,574 --> 00:30:48,974
Is he still trying to hurt you?

517
00:30:49,208 --> 00:30:50,810
No, he disappeared.

518
00:30:50,976 --> 00:30:52,444
Can you please just send
a ranger?

519
00:30:53,011 --> 00:30:54,581
<i>Listen,</i>

520
00:30:54,614 --> 00:30:56,248

it sounds like you might have

00:30:56,281 --> 00:30:58,685
stumbled across somebody
doing target practice.

522
00:30:58,718 --> 00:31:00,352
<i>We advise that anyone
out in federal land</i>

523
00:31:00,386 --> 00:31:01,821
<i>let their presence be known
at all times</i>

524
00:31:01,855 --> 00:31:03,288
<i>to avoid any accidents.</i>

525
00:31:03,322 --> 00:31:05,124
This was not
a fucking accident.

526
00:31:05,157 --> 00:31:06,593
<i>Someone shot at us!</i>

527
00:31:06,626 --> 00:31:08,227
Look, I understand you're upset.

528
00:31:08,260 --> 00:31:09,895
I'm just trying to get
accurate information.

529
00:31:10,162 --> 00:31:13,065
Look, he's gone now,
but could you please just sent a ranger?

530
00:31:13,533 --> 00:31:15,033
One of our rangers is
already out there,

531
00:31:15,067 --> 00:31:16,836
but I think his comm's
out of range.

532
00:31:16,870 --> 00:31:18,772
Once he gets back in range,

533
00:31:19,471 --> 00:31:20,939
I'll have him head your way.

534
00:31:20,973 --> 00:31:22,575
- You said you're off the Bennet Trail?
- <i>Yes.</i>

535
00:31:23,142 --> 00:31:24,878
Okay. Thank you.

536
00:31:24,910 --> 00:31:26,746
<i>Once again,
there's a lot of hunters</i>

537
00:31:26,780 --> 00:31:28,480
<i>and a lot of people doing
target practice out there.</i>

538
00:31:28,514 --> 00:31:30,784
Just make sure your presence
is known at all times,

539
00:31:30,817 --> 00:31:31,950
and be safe.

540
00:31:32,484 --> 00:31:33,653
Okay. Thank you.

541
00:31:34,486 --> 00:31:35,555
Assholes!

542
00:31:36,288 --> 00:31:37,489
So, can we head back now?

543
00:31:38,023 --> 00:31:40,325
Yeah, but we're not gonna make
it back to the car before dark.

544
00:31:41,927 --> 00:31:43,730
Redneck motherfuckers!

545
00:31:44,831 --> 00:31:46,298

to get us.

546
00:31:46,331 --> 00:31:48,100
Fucking assholes.

547
00:32:03,850 --> 00:32:06,553
[Riley] Heather, don't.
You're battery's gonna die.

548
00:32:07,386 --> 00:32:10,022
[Heather] Hello,
my nice respectful followers.

549
00:32:10,055 --> 00:32:11,691
Here with my friends,
Sam and Riley,

550
00:32:11,724 --> 00:32:14,293
and something not that cool
just happened.

551
00:32:14,326 --> 00:32:16,462
Basically, some random
asshole creeper,

552
00:32:16,495 --> 00:32:19,398
who I'm pretty sure has been
anonymously DMing me all day,

553
00:32:19,431 --> 00:32:22,000
just shot a fucking arrow at us.

554
00:32:22,034 --> 00:32:23,435
Now why, may you ask,

555
00:32:23,469 --> 00:32:25,939
would someone shoot an arrow at
a group of people?

556
00:32:25,971 --> 00:32:28,340
I have a few theories.
Basically, I'm pretty sure

557
00:32:28,373 --> 00:32:30,375
he's some basement-dwelling
social reject

558
00:32:30,409 --> 00:32:31,911
who couldn't get a girl
to save his life.

559
00:32:31,945 --> 00:32:33,412
He's probably
sitting around moping

560
00:32:33,445 --> 00:32:34,881
wondering why he
doesn't get the respect

561
00:32:34,914 --> 00:32:36,850
he so feels entitled to.

562
00:32:37,082 --> 00:32:38,484
Well, I have
a little message for him.

563
00:32:38,685 --> 00:32:41,353
Fuck. You.
I know you're watching.

564
00:32:41,386 --> 00:32:43,989
I know you love to creep
and watch me share my life.

565
00:32:44,289 --> 00:32:47,059
Fuck off! If I ever figure out
who the fuck you are,

566
00:32:47,092 --> 00:32:49,394
I'm plastering your face
all over my account

567
00:32:49,428 --> 00:32:50,663
so that every girl...

568
00:32:50,697 --> 00:32:53,165
No, every person within
a 100 mile radius

569
00:32:53,198 --> 00:32:55,735
knows that you're a stupid
creeper asshole fuck.

570
00:32:58,972 --> 00:33:00,740
We can't let this ruin the trip.

571
00:33:00,773 --> 00:33:02,642
I know.
That's exactly what he wants.

572
00:33:05,678 --> 00:33:07,279
Why the fuck did you grab that?

573
00:33:07,312 --> 00:33:08,848
Uh, I don't know.

574
00:33:09,248 --> 00:33:11,651
Good. Keep it. You can
shove it up his ass later.

575
00:33:11,684 --> 00:33:13,553
Huh. Not a bad idea.

576
00:33:14,554 --> 00:33:16,121
We should really make camp soon.

577
00:33:16,154 --> 00:33:18,223
There's a good spot in,
like, half a mile.

578
00:33:20,292 --> 00:33:22,261
Maybe Heather will get
poison oak again.

579
00:33:23,262 --> 00:33:24,797
I forgot about that.
Wasn't that, like,

580
00:33:24,831 --> 00:33:26,533
the first year,
it was all over your leg?

581
00:33:28,233 --> 00:33:29,401
Heather?

582
00:33:31,571 --> 00:33:33,105
Heather, I'm pissed, too.

583
00:33:33,606 --> 00:33:35,440
That was a shitty,
shitty thing to do.

584
00:33:35,975 --> 00:33:38,043
But you're just giving him
what he wants.

585
00:33:38,845 --> 00:33:40,980
He's just trying to freak us out
and ruin the whole trip.

586
00:33:41,814 --> 00:33:43,016
Yeah.

587
00:33:45,552 --> 00:33:48,588
He's probably already back in
his mom's basement by now.

588
00:33:49,889 --> 00:33:51,290
Probably jerking off to some

589
00:33:51,323 --> 00:33:53,458
<i>Transformers</i> Megan Fox poster.

Oh, my God.

591
00:33:55,327 --> 00:33:57,262
I did not need that image
back in my head.

592
00:33:58,263 --> 00:33:59,766
What? Explain.

593
00:34:00,198 --> 00:34:03,603
Remember Jeremy Stanton?
Lived below me sophomore year.

594
00:34:03,636 --> 00:34:05,203
- Yeah.
- Oh, my God.

595
00:34:05,237 --> 00:34:09,943
So, that fucker would like,
never, ever leave his room.

596
00:34:10,442 --> 00:34:12,745
And one day,
I get locked out of my place

597
00:34:12,779 --> 00:34:14,914
so I need to go through
his fire escape

598
00:34:14,948 --> 00:34:16,415
so I can get back up.

599
00:34:16,448 --> 00:34:18,283
And I knock on his door,

600
00:34:18,517 --> 00:34:22,154
and it's just
floor to ceiling pictures

601
00:34:22,187 --> 00:34:23,990
of Megan Fox from <i>Transfomers.</i>

602
00:34:24,122 --> 00:34:25,357
That's fucking bizarre.

603
00:34:25,390 --> 00:34:28,962
Oh, God, no, it was like
this 20 year old man

604
00:34:28,995 --> 00:34:33,032
with this creepy
"14 year old in 2007" obsession

605
00:34:33,066 --> 00:34:34,466
with Megan Fox.

606
00:34:34,499 --> 00:34:36,836
It's so true.
I didn't believe Riley at first,

607
00:34:36,869 --> 00:34:39,072
so I went myself,
said I was lost,

608
00:34:39,438 --> 00:34:42,942

Hello, hello,
my beautiful followers.

613
00:35:20,479 --> 00:35:23,650
We have finally made it here
after a very long hike

614
00:35:23,683 --> 00:35:25,685
and a very shitty incident

615
00:35:25,718 --> 00:35:27,920
involving a very shitty person.

616
00:35:27,954 --> 00:35:30,489
But it's okay, because we're
here and I'm with my friends.

617

a centaur or something.

- [Riley] Yeah. What?

00:36:51,137 --> 00:36:53,305

I'm too high. I can't.

- I'm too high for that. [laughs]

Whenever I was...

646
00:37:18,698 --> 00:37:19,899
thinking he was lying

647
00:37:19,932 --> 00:37:22,168
or trying to convince me
I was crazy,

648
00:37:22,201 --> 00:37:25,337
he'd just bring up
the galaxies thing.

649
00:37:27,740 --> 00:37:28,975

00:37:29,474 --> 00:37:32,845
how small my fears and...

651
00:37:34,513 --> 00:37:36,149
everything were when...

652
00:37:37,150 --> 00:37:39,752
you know, there were all these
fucking planets so far away

653

and there could be
other life and...

he was convinced that

655
00:37:45,792 --> 00:37:47,693
I didn't understand
my place in the universe,

656
00:37:47,727 --> 00:37:50,897

any right to think

657
00:37:50,930 --> 00:37:52,565
that I was sane...

658
00:37:55,535 --> 00:37:58,403

00:37:58,436 --> 00:38:00,206
what I was...

875
00:57:02,148 --> 00:57:04,350
He was filming it
and he put it all online.

876
00:57:04,550 --> 00:57:06,719
- What?
- Yeah.

877
00:57:06,953 --> 00:57:08,621
Is that what
the fuckin' laptop was for?

878
00:57:08,654 --> 00:57:09,989
- Yeah.
- Okay.

879
00:57:10,022 --> 00:57:11,924
I think he's been watching us
for a while.

880
00:57:13,292 --> 00:57:15,828
- Is he dead?
- Yeah, I think so.

881
00:57:15,861 --> 00:57:18,064
Sam shoved an arrow
through his stomach.

882
00:57:21,267 --> 00:57:22,935
Sam, is your leg okay?

883
00:57:22,969 --> 00:57:24,469
It's fine.

884
00:57:29,909 --> 00:57:32,311
That's a truck.
Look, a truck.

885
00:57:36,749 --> 00:57:38,918
Hey! Hey!

- You have to help us.
- What happened? What happened?

888
00:57:43,889 --> 00:57:46,659
There's a guy after us.
He's been shooting arrows at us.

889
00:57:46,692 --> 00:57:48,861
- What?
- Please. Help.

890
00:57:49,562 --> 00:57:51,998

<i>What's the situation?</i>

892
00:57:53,866 --> 00:57:57,236
I got a female hiker, early 20s,
with a possible compound fracture.

893
00:57:57,269 --> 00:57:59,338
<i>I'll send search and rescue
your way.</i>

894
00:57:59,905 --> 00:58:02,675
Roger. All right, just breathe.
What happened?

895
00:58:03,242 --> 00:58:04,744
Some kind of bear trap.

896
00:58:04,777 --> 00:58:06,245
Jesus Christ.
All right, you know what?

897
00:58:06,278 --> 00:58:07,713
This is gonna be easier
if I take you in the truck.

898
00:58:07,747 --> 00:58:09,348
Okay. Come on.
