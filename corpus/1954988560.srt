You violated the oath.

10
00:04:13,387 --> 00:04:16,056
We manufacture drugs

11
00:04:16,156 --> 00:04:17,891
We don't use ourselves.

12
00:04:17,991 --> 00:04:21,061
In doing so, you
have jeopardized

13
00:04:21,161 --> 00:04:23,230
The whole operation.

14
00:04:23,331 --> 00:04:27,468

Listen to me.

28
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:48,322
I can stop anytime I want to.

29
00:04:48,422 --> 00:04:51,825
Mongo, I can stop anytime.

30
00:04:51,925 --> 00:04:52,826
What could I do?

31
00:04:52,926 --> 00:04:54,528
It was all around me.

32
00:04:54,628 --> 00:04:55,329
Ah.

33
00:05:02,403 --> 00:05:07,408
We must protect our lab
from traitors and intruders.

34
00:05:07,508 --> 00:05:10,210
One more week, we will
disband, we'll have

35
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:13,914
All the money we ever need.

36
00:05:14,014 --> 00:05:14,882
Yeah.

37
00:05:14,982 --> 00:05:15,883
Yeah.

00:05:15,983 --> 00:05:17,385
CROWD: Yeah.

39
00:05:17,485 --> 00:05:18,386
Yeah.

Yeah.

41
00:05:19,487 --> 00:05:20,354
Yeah.

42
00:05:20,454 --> 00:05:21,355

43
00:05:21,455 --> 00:05:22,356

Yeah.

50
00:05:48,348 --> 00:05:49,717
Well, Ms. Morris,
if you're ready,

51
00:05:49,817 --> 00:05:52,052
I have everything I need to
show you that nice little piece

52
00:05:52,152 --> 00:05:53,421
Of property.

53
00:05:53,521 --> 00:05:56,056
Yes, I'm ready, and
please call me Susan.

54
00:06:05,933 --> 00:06:09,770
So Susan, you said your
husband passed away?

55
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:13,373
Yes, two years ago.

56
00:06:13,474 --> 00:06:14,842
That's too bad.

57
00:06:14,942 --> 00:06:18,211
I am sorry, but may I
be so forward as to ask

58
00:06:18,311 --> 00:06:20,113
Is the way you're going
to purchase the property?

59
00:06:20,213 --> 00:06:22,249
With insurance money?

60
00:06:22,349 --> 00:06:24,818
Well, yes, some insurance
and some savings.

61
00:06:24,918 --> 00:06:26,119
It's what my
husband and I always

62
00:06:26,219 --> 00:06:29,557
Talked about doing someday,
buying a piece of property

63
00:06:29,657 --> 00:06:32,960
Out away from everything,
away from the rat race,

64
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:38,666
Then... then he was killed in a
car accident by a drunk driver.

65
00:06:38,766 --> 00:06:39,800
I'm sorry, Susan.

66
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:43,837
I didn't mean to sound
so, well, what I mean,

67
00:06:43,937 --> 00:06:45,706
I was just trying
to see how we could

68
00:06:45,806 --> 00:06:47,541
Get the best deal for you.

69
00:06:47,641 --> 00:06:50,277
I hope you understand, it really
does help if I know how much

70
00:06:50,377 --> 00:06:53,246
Money a buyer has to work with.

71
00:06:53,346 --> 00:06:55,048
Sure, I understand.

72
00:06:55,148 --> 00:06:56,984
Well, anyway, this
property sounds

73
00:06:57,084 --> 00:06:58,952
Like what you're looking for.

74
00:06:59,052 --> 00:07:00,654
It's been on the
market quite a while

75
00:07:00,754 --> 00:07:03,824
And I think I can get
you an excellent deal.

76
00:07:03,924 --> 00:07:05,826
But, like I said,
it's out in the sticks

77
00:07:05,926 --> 00:07:08,929
And we're in for quite a drive.

78
00:07:09,029 --> 00:07:12,032
It sounds real nice, Cecil,
exactly what I'm looking for.

79
00:07:22,776 --> 00:07:26,013
Now, Susan, don't let the
width of the road frighten you.

80
00:07:26,113 --> 00:07:28,849
The many times I've been on this
road and haven't seen a soul.

81
00:07:28,949 --> 00:07:32,486
And the times I have,
they've all been courteous.

82
00:07:32,586 --> 00:07:35,288
Real nice people
live in this area.

83
00:07:35,388 --> 00:07:36,990
I consider myself
a good driver.

84
00:07:37,090 --> 00:07:38,158
It doesn't bother me.

85
00:07:45,365 --> 00:07:46,066
Oh, jeez.

86
00:07:48,836 --> 00:07:50,170
I don't believe this.

87
00:07:57,945 --> 00:07:59,947
You do have a spare, I hope.

88
00:08:00,047 --> 00:08:01,481
Course I do.

89
00:08:01,582 --> 00:08:03,383
I should have.

90
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:05,418
Better have.

91
00:08:05,519 --> 00:08:06,219
I do.

92
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:10,323
Ah.

93
00:08:10,423 --> 00:08:11,825
It's even got air in it.

94
00:08:44,725 --> 00:08:46,126
What do you think?

95
00:08:55,368 --> 00:08:56,069
I don't know.

96
00:09:08,982 --> 00:09:11,819
Ow, damn it.

97
00:09:11,919 --> 00:09:13,821
Cecil, let me help, please, OK?

98
00:09:13,921 --> 00:09:15,222
Oh, fine.

99
00:09:15,322 --> 00:09:18,792
You know, every time one of my
three brothers ran out of gas

100
00:09:18,892 --> 00:09:21,161
Or got a flat tire, they'd
make me go to the gas station

101
00:09:21,261 --> 00:09:23,096
Or change the tire.

102
00:09:23,196 --> 00:09:27,367
They said because I was a
girl, I needed the experience.

103
00:09:27,467 --> 00:09:30,671
Now I know exactly
what they mean.

104
00:09:30,771 --> 00:09:33,173
Huh, you seem to have
the touch, all right.

105
00:09:33,273 --> 00:09:34,174
Thank you.

106
00:09:34,274 --> 00:09:35,843
All right, let's go.

107
00:09:35,943 --> 00:09:36,644
Sure.

108
00:09:48,722 --> 00:09:49,589
Let's go.

109
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:22,322
Jesus, what the hell was that?

110
00:10:22,422 --> 00:10:23,791
That guys could've killed us.

111
00:10:28,762 --> 00:10:32,599
Now, Susan, relax, please.

112
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:36,870
Probably just a couple
of kids out having fun.

113
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:38,371
No big deal.

114
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:40,340
I don't think so, Cecil.

115
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:42,142
That looked that truck
I saw back at a ranch

116
00:10:42,242 --> 00:10:43,777
Where we had the flat tire.

117
00:10:43,877 --> 00:10:45,779
I don't know what ranch
you're talking about.

118
00:10:45,879 --> 00:10:49,482
Ah, just some kids.

119
00:10:49,582 --> 00:10:53,353
Well, OK, Cecil, but
I don't like this.

120
00:10:53,453 --> 00:10:56,056
Don't you think we should
turn around and go back?

121
00:10:56,156 --> 00:10:59,192
Now, Susan, you're here to
see a nice piece of property

122
00:10:59,292 --> 00:11:01,628
And that's what I'd
like to do for you.

123
00:11:01,729 --> 00:11:03,296
This could be your dream house.

124
00:11:03,396 --> 00:11:07,000
I think you ought to have the
opportunity to have a look at.

125
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:07,835
Now, wouldn't you agree?

126
00:11:11,104 --> 00:11:13,606
Those were just a
couple of punk kids,

127
00:11:13,707 --> 00:11:15,242
Nothing to be frightened about.

128
00:11:15,342 --> 00:11:17,177
And besides, I'm here.

129
00:11:59,586 --> 00:12:01,488
They're [inaudible],
you dipshit.

130
00:12:01,588 --> 00:12:03,490
What the hell do they want?

131
00:12:03,590 --> 00:12:05,959
I don't know, but they're
messing with the wrong guy.

132
00:12:10,563 --> 00:12:12,432
Oh, man, this is screwed.

133
00:12:12,532 --> 00:12:14,935
SUSAN: I agree, let's
get the hell out of here.

134
00:12:24,477 --> 00:12:26,379
Oh, shit, we've had it.

135
00:12:26,479 --> 00:12:27,380
Don't say that.

136
00:12:31,952 --> 00:12:33,353
What do you want from us?

137
00:12:33,453 --> 00:12:34,855
They want to kill us,
that's what they want.

138
00:12:53,907 --> 00:12:55,909
[Coughing]

139
00:12:56,009 --> 00:12:58,045
Cecil, oh, jeez,
are you all right?

140
00:12:58,145 --> 00:13:00,881
I'm not dead.

141
00:13:00,981 --> 00:13:03,683
I got down, but
I'm... I'm not dead.

142
00:13:03,783 --> 00:13:05,685
Hell of a ride.

143
00:13:05,785 --> 00:13:08,055
Cecil, my legs are
stuck, I can't move.

144
00:13:08,155 --> 00:13:09,289
Look at my car.

145
00:13:09,389 --> 00:13:11,724
I... I can get out.

146
00:13:11,825 --> 00:13:14,227
No, Cecil, wait.

147
00:13:14,327 --> 00:13:15,228
Pull me out of here.

148
00:13:15,328 --> 00:13:17,097
I... I'll get help.

149
00:13:17,197 --> 00:13:20,067
SUSAN: Wait,
please, help me out.

150
00:13:20,167 --> 00:13:22,735
God damn you, Cecil, let
me out of here, help.

151
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:28,575
No truck again.

152
00:13:28,675 --> 00:13:30,911
I'm getting the
hell out of here.

153
00:13:31,011 --> 00:13:33,146
Trust me, Susan, I'll get help.

154
00:13:33,246 --> 00:13:34,014
Trust me.

155
00:13:34,114 --> 00:13:35,115
Trust me, I will.

156
00:13:41,154 --> 00:13:41,989
No, don't leave me here.

157
00:13:42,089 --> 00:13:44,157
Cecil, please, help me out.

158
00:13:49,129 --> 00:13:51,664
Cecil, God damn you, come back.

159
00:13:51,764 --> 00:13:54,101
Help me out.

160
00:13:54,201 --> 00:13:56,069
I can't believe this
has happened to me.

161
00:13:56,169 --> 00:13:57,504
Cecil, where are you?

162
00:14:22,629 --> 00:14:24,297
What kind of person are you?

163
00:15:04,704 --> 00:15:07,074
Oh, shit.

164
00:15:07,174 --> 00:15:08,575
What the hell is this?

165
00:15:19,852 --> 00:15:20,553
Oh, shit.

166
00:15:51,084 --> 00:15:52,719
There's that son of a bitch.

167
00:15:52,819 --> 00:15:54,221
Cecil?

168
00:15:54,321 --> 00:15:56,189
Cecil?

169
00:15:56,289 --> 00:15:57,690
Cecil, it's Susan.

170
00:16:07,667 --> 00:16:10,537
Cecil, you bastard, how
could you leave me like that?

171
00:16:10,637 --> 00:16:13,640
I could have died
in that damn car.

172
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:15,608
How do you like my jacket?

173
00:16:15,708 --> 00:16:19,479
I tried to be friends with him,
but I don't think he liked me.

174
00:16:19,579 --> 00:16:20,280
[Door slamming]

175
00:16:20,380 --> 00:16:21,781
[Laughter]

176
00:16:21,881 --> 00:16:23,250
I never liked that
stupid jacket anyway.

177
00:16:31,491 --> 00:16:32,192
Ah.

178
00:16:36,929 --> 00:16:38,431
Ah.

179

[Knocking]

180
00:16:40,767 --> 00:16:46,005
Yoo-hoo, is anyone home?

181
00:16:46,106 --> 00:16:50,009
Can the little girl
come out and play?

182
00:16:50,110 --> 00:16:52,512
I'm afraid of the dark.

183
00:16:52,612 --> 00:16:54,514
[Knocking]

184
00:16:54,614 --> 00:16:55,982
Come out and play.

185
00:17:03,590 --> 00:17:06,359
Let go of the door
and come out and play.

186
00:17:09,429 --> 00:17:10,830
Is there a light in here?

187
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:15,802
[Screaming]

188
00:17:15,902 --> 00:17:16,769
What have they done to you?

189
00:17:37,757 --> 00:17:40,127
Ah, let go of my
hand, you bitch.

190
00:17:45,598 --> 00:17:46,433
You're hurting me.

191
00:17:50,503 --> 00:17:52,839
Please, you're hurting me.

192
00:17:52,939 --> 00:17:54,307
Please, my hand.

193
00:17:54,407 --> 00:17:55,108
Please.

194
00:18:01,481 --> 00:18:03,816
You bitch, you bitch.

195
00:18:13,626 --> 00:18:17,697
Let me go and... and
I'll be nice to you.

196
00:18:17,797 --> 00:18:21,701
Please, nice little girl, I
can help you get out of here.

197
00:18:32,712 --> 00:18:35,582
Let go of me and get me
out of here, you bitch.

198
00:18:50,563 --> 00:18:51,931
Shit, now what?

199
00:18:52,031 --> 00:18:55,602
I swear I'll be nice to you.

200
00:18:55,702 --> 00:18:56,403
Bitch.

201
00:18:59,972 --> 00:19:02,842
Ah.

202
00:19:02,942 --> 00:19:04,344
Bitch.

203
00:19:04,444 --> 00:19:06,313
Oops.

204
00:19:06,413 --> 00:19:08,315
You get over here and help me.

205
00:19:15,355 --> 00:19:17,724
Going some place?

206
00:19:17,824 --> 00:19:19,726
No, wait a minute, I
don't what the problem is,

207
00:19:19,826 --> 00:19:22,295
But I didn't do anything
to any of you people.

208
00:19:22,395 --> 00:19:23,763
I'll kill you.

209
00:19:23,863 --> 00:19:25,265
Get me out of here.

210
00:19:25,365 --> 00:19:27,767
Don't you leave me here.

211
00:19:27,867 --> 00:19:31,238
And as for you, girl,
there is no more problem.

212
00:19:31,338 --> 00:19:33,706
Not for us, anyway.

213
00:19:33,806 --> 00:19:37,076
You bitch, get over here.

214
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:39,979
Somebody get Apples.

215
00:19:40,079 --> 00:19:44,517
What do you think Mongo's
going to want us to do with her?

216
00:19:44,617 --> 00:19:46,353
I know what to do with her.

217
00:19:46,453 --> 00:19:47,387
I know what to do too.

218
00:19:55,295 --> 00:19:56,596
What do you think you're doing?

219
00:19:56,696 --> 00:19:58,265
Yeah, what do you
think you're doing?

220
00:19:58,365 --> 00:20:00,066
I'm going to take
care of the problem.

221
00:20:00,166 --> 00:20:00,933
What problem?

222
00:20:01,033 --> 00:20:01,734
She's mine.

223
00:20:01,834 --> 00:20:02,902
She's mine.

224
00:20:03,002 --> 00:20:03,703
She's mine.

225
00:20:03,803 --> 00:20:04,671
I'll kill the bitch.

226
00:20:04,771 --> 00:20:08,174
[Screaming]

227
00:20:37,437 --> 00:20:39,939
Mongo, Mongo, I
saved her for you.

228
00:20:40,039 --> 00:20:41,374
I saved her for you.

229
00:20:44,311 --> 00:20:47,580
SUSAN: Hey, you're the son of a
bitch that ran us off the road.

230
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:49,749
You are in my territory.

231
00:20:49,849 --> 00:20:53,586
You are ruining my
fucking operation.

232
00:20:53,686 --> 00:20:55,021
Tie her up in the barn.

233
00:20:55,121 --> 00:20:56,923
The rest of you,
get back to work.

234
00:20:57,023 --> 00:20:58,958
How can we make any money?

235
00:20:59,058 --> 00:21:01,561
No drugs, no money.

236
00:21:01,661 --> 00:21:03,062
Now, tie her up now.

237
00:21:23,583 --> 00:21:25,885
What's going on here?

238
00:21:25,985 --> 00:21:27,387
Should I dump it?

239
00:21:27,487 --> 00:21:28,888
No, use it.

240
00:22:39,358 --> 00:22:40,326
You should be nice to me.

241
00:22:40,427 --> 00:22:42,762
I can make your short
life a lot easier.

242
00:22:46,833 --> 00:22:48,234
Ow, shit, that hurt.

243
00:22:52,304 --> 00:22:56,175
[Screaming]

244
00:23:35,381 --> 00:23:37,784
I'm one bad bitch,
don't fuck with me.

245
00:23:46,526 --> 00:23:47,226
Wow.

246
00:23:50,830 --> 00:23:51,698
Oh, shit.

247
00:23:55,301 --> 00:23:56,703
Terk, get some
people and get her.

248
00:23:56,803 --> 00:23:57,704
Damn it, get her.

249
00:23:57,804 --> 00:23:58,671
What about Star?

250
00:23:58,771 --> 00:23:59,672
What about Star?

251
00:25:00,199 --> 00:25:01,333
You're a dead
fucking shit if you

252
00:25:01,433 --> 00:25:02,902
Don't do exactly what I say.

253
00:25:06,873 --> 00:25:09,275
Now you just lay there you
keep your fucking mouth shut

254
00:25:09,375 --> 00:25:11,744
Or I'll cut your fucking throat.

255
00:26:00,059 --> 00:26:03,429
[Screaming]

256
00:26:32,358 --> 00:26:33,259
Get the bitch.

257
00:26:39,331 --> 00:26:41,734
Ha-ha, man, she did you.

258
00:26:41,834 --> 00:26:42,869
She really did you.

259
00:26:42,969 --> 00:26:44,136
What?
What?

260
00:26:44,236 --> 00:26:44,971
Hang on.

261
00:26:45,071 --> 00:26:45,938
Oh, what?

262
00:26:46,038 --> 00:26:49,408
[Screaming]

263
00:27:23,943 --> 00:27:24,643
SUSAN: Help me.

264
00:27:24,744 --> 00:27:25,644
Please, help me.

265
00:27:30,382 --> 00:27:31,417
Help me.

266
00:27:31,517 --> 00:27:33,552
I don't know where I'm
at or what I'm doing.

267
00:27:33,652 --> 00:27:35,554
Let's go inside and
we'll call the sheriff.

268
00:27:44,563 --> 00:27:45,297
What are you doing?

269
00:27:45,397 --> 00:27:46,098
What's wrong?

270
00:27:46,198 --> 00:27:47,199
I need your help, please.

271
00:27:47,299 --> 00:27:49,936
I need your help.

272
00:27:50,036 --> 00:27:51,670
Here's your loose end, Mongo.

273
00:27:51,771 --> 00:27:53,605
Take care of it now.

274
00:27:53,706 --> 00:27:55,742
The silly bitch ran to
the wrong ranch for help.

275
00:27:55,842 --> 00:27:56,876
Huh?
Huh?

276
00:27:56,976 --> 00:27:57,744
What?

277
00:27:57,844 --> 00:27:58,878
What did I to you?

278
00:27:58,978 --> 00:27:59,846
You didn't do anything.

279
00:27:59,946 --> 00:28:01,714
You're just a game.

280
00:28:01,814 --> 00:28:03,315
Game's over, Mongo.

281
00:28:03,415 --> 00:28:05,151
Take her back to the
old ranch and kill her.

282
00:28:05,251 --> 00:28:06,585
Kill her?

283
00:28:06,685 --> 00:28:08,287
Shut up, bitch.

284
00:28:08,387 --> 00:28:09,922
You're dead.

285
00:28:10,022 --> 00:28:11,891
You died when you did this.

286
00:28:11,991 --> 00:28:15,394
Yeah, you dead, you
dead, you fucking dead.

287
00:28:15,494 --> 00:28:18,630
Then do it now.

288
00:28:18,731 --> 00:28:21,667
What'd you say?

289
00:28:21,768 --> 00:28:23,770
What did he say?

290
00:28:23,870 --> 00:28:25,337
Mongo, she's a problem for us.

291
00:28:25,437 --> 00:28:28,340
We stand to make lots of money
on these next few shipments.

292
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:31,377
We should be making drugs,
not chasing this bimbo around.

293
00:28:31,477 --> 00:28:32,378
Bimbo?

294
00:28:32,478 --> 00:28:34,747
The San Francisco
shipment is ready.

295
00:28:34,847 --> 00:28:36,115
All we're waiting for is you.

296
00:28:36,215 --> 00:28:38,384
The super shipment to
LA will be ready when

297
00:28:38,484 --> 00:28:39,819
You get back with the cash.

298
00:28:39,919 --> 00:28:41,687
As far as the girl
is concerned, I'll

299
00:28:41,788 --> 00:28:44,056
Deal with her as I see fit.

300
00:28:44,156 --> 00:28:47,960
And remember, don't forget
to come back with that cash.

301
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:51,764
OK, Mongo, I just want to make
sure everything is all right.

302
00:28:51,864 --> 00:28:53,599
We all stand to make
some quick money.

303
00:28:53,699 --> 00:28:57,469
And after the LA sale,
we'll disband this operation,

304
00:28:57,569 --> 00:28:59,705
And we'll all live
happily ever after.

305
00:28:59,806 --> 00:29:01,673
Right, Mr. Wilson?

306
00:29:01,774 --> 00:29:02,608
Yeah, right.

307
00:29:02,708 --> 00:29:04,476
The game's not over.

308
00:29:04,576 --> 00:29:06,779
When we get back to our
ranch, tie her up in the barn

309
00:29:06,879 --> 00:29:07,814
And take her shoes.

310
00:29:07,914 --> 00:29:10,516
She gets away again,
she won't get far.

311
00:29:10,616 --> 00:29:11,650
Let's go, move it.

312
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:13,652
Yeah, the game's not over.

313
00:29:13,752 --> 00:29:14,453
What did he say?

314
00:29:14,553 --> 00:29:15,955
You heard the man, move it.

315
00:29:16,055 --> 00:29:17,189
Let's go, come on.

316
00:29:26,198 --> 00:29:28,567
OK, listen up.

317
00:29:28,667 --> 00:29:33,639
You three, put the shipment
in Mr. Wilson's car.

318
00:29:33,739 --> 00:29:34,473
Come on, let's go.

319
00:29:46,953 --> 00:29:49,621
I'll be one or two
days in San Francisco.

320
00:29:49,721 --> 00:29:51,023
Good.

321
00:29:51,123 --> 00:29:53,159
When you get back with the cash,
the LA shipment will be ready.

322
00:29:53,259 --> 00:29:54,526
Take care of that woman.

323
00:29:54,626 --> 00:29:56,628
She's trouble.

324
00:29:56,728 --> 00:29:57,596
Don't worry.

325
00:29:57,696 --> 00:29:58,998
She's no big deal.

326
00:29:59,098 --> 00:30:01,333
That's what makes me so
good at selling drugs,

327
00:30:01,433 --> 00:30:04,803
Because I worry about detail.

328
00:30:04,904 --> 00:30:06,272
She's no problem.

329
00:30:27,359 --> 00:30:29,395
Me and Mongo are like that.

330
00:30:29,495 --> 00:30:32,131
Tight, man, tight.

331
00:30:32,231 --> 00:30:34,100
I'm the only one he trusts.

332
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:36,535
So he sent me in here
to check up on you.

333
00:30:44,010 --> 00:30:44,743
Oh, Jesus.

334
00:31:17,076 --> 00:31:19,178
Now you be quiet.

335
00:31:19,278 --> 00:31:21,047
Kiss me.

336
00:31:21,147 --> 00:31:21,981
What?

337
00:31:22,081 --> 00:31:22,781
Kiss me.

338
00:31:30,722 --> 00:31:32,224
Now what's the problem?

339
00:31:32,324 --> 00:31:35,561
Take the tape off.

340
00:31:35,661 --> 00:31:37,196
I can't do that.

341
00:31:37,296 --> 00:31:39,631
And you're getting
me out of the mood.

342
00:31:39,731 --> 00:31:42,501
Take the tape off and I
will do whatever you want.

343
00:31:47,739 --> 00:31:50,309
Shit, I hate that.

344
00:31:50,409 --> 00:31:56,215
You scream and I'll
cut your eyes out.

345
00:31:56,315 --> 00:31:59,051
If I did that, I'd have
a barn full of men beating

346
00:31:59,151 --> 00:32:00,786
Me and slapping me around.

347
00:32:00,886 --> 00:32:02,588
I wouldn't want that.

348
00:32:02,688 --> 00:32:03,755
All I want is you.

349
00:32:06,825 --> 00:32:07,726
Kiss me.

350
00:32:17,203 --> 00:32:18,104
Now what?

351
00:32:18,204 --> 00:32:19,938
What the hell is the problem?

352
00:32:20,039 --> 00:32:22,641
Untie my hands.

353
00:32:22,741 --> 00:32:23,875
I can't do that.

354
00:32:23,976 --> 00:32:27,446
Oh, you think I'm
stupid or something

355
00:32:27,546 --> 00:32:29,015
Or you're fucking with me.

356
00:32:29,115 --> 00:32:31,850
Don't fuck with me.

357
00:32:31,950 --> 00:32:34,353
No, I don't think
you're stupid.

358
00:32:34,453 --> 00:32:37,956
You've got a knife
and my feet are tied

359
00:32:38,057 --> 00:32:44,330
And you're much stronger
than I. All I want is you.

360
00:32:44,430 --> 00:32:45,131
Kiss me.

361
00:32:53,439 --> 00:32:57,643
Untie my hands and I'll really
show you how to make love.

362
00:32:57,743 --> 00:32:58,444
Oh.

363
00:33:18,530 --> 00:33:21,600
Now, see, isn't that better?

364
00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:23,435
Oh, shit.

365
00:33:23,535 --> 00:33:24,436

What are you doing?

416
00:39:03,308 --> 00:39:04,676
Why are you slowing down?

417
00:39:04,776 --> 00:39:07,579
It's cuz he can't drive worth

00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:19,958
Sit on her if you have to.

428
00:39:20,058 --> 00:39:21,259
Get her out of sight, man.

429
00:39:21,359 --> 00:39:23,228
Geno's had two DUIs.

430
00:39:23,328 --> 00:39:25,931
He gets one more, he's
looking at a year in the can.

They have to be stopped.

00:39:59,297 --> 00:40:00,198
You're going to kill us.

446
00:40:00,298 --> 00:40:01,667
Get us back on the main road.

552
00:48:17,662 --> 00:48:20,031
Yeah, sure.

553
00:48:20,131 --> 00:48:23,501
[Gunshots]

554
00:48:29,040 --> 00:48:31,476
Shoot the fucking tires, huh?

555
00:48:31,576 --> 00:48:32,477
Let's go.

556
00:49:00,205 --> 00:49:01,506
We got her.

557
00:49:01,606 --> 00:49:03,541
We got her in the sheriff's car.

558
00:49:03,641 --> 00:49:05,776
We got her and it
was my idea too.

559
00:49:05,876 --> 00:49:07,012
So where's the car?

560
00:49:07,112 --> 00:49:07,812
That's the problem.

561
00:49:07,912 --> 00:49:09,747
She's driving the car.

562
00:49:09,847 --> 00:49:11,116
She's driving the car?

563
00:49:11,216 --> 00:49:12,683
She's driving the fucking car?

564
00:49:12,783 --> 00:49:13,518
What do you mean?

565
00:49:13,618 --> 00:49:14,319
It's no problem.

566
00:49:14,419 --> 00:49:15,720
She's heading for the canyon.

567
00:49:15,820 --> 00:49:18,556
We can take a shortcut through
there, boom, we got her.

568
00:49:18,656 --> 00:49:19,724
No big deal.

569
00:49:19,824 --> 00:49:22,827
OK, fuck head, but
you better be right.

570
00:49:22,927 --> 00:49:24,129
I'll be back at the ranch.

571
00:49:58,363 --> 00:50:00,665
What in the hell
is she doing, Terk?

572
00:50:00,765 --> 00:50:01,466
How the hell do I know?

573
00:50:12,177 --> 00:50:14,479
Just like a woman,
changing her mind.

574
00:50:14,579 --> 00:50:15,280
Come on.

575
00:50:19,250 --> 00:50:21,586
Told you this was a
stupid idea of yours, Buck,

576
00:50:21,686 --> 00:50:22,553
You fucking idiot.

577
00:50:22,653 --> 00:50:23,888
Who are you calling names?

578
00:50:44,875 --> 00:50:45,776
She's coming back.

579
00:50:45,876 --> 00:50:46,977
She's coming back.
Let's go.

580
00:50:47,078 --> 00:50:47,778
Come on.

581
00:50:47,878 --> 00:50:48,946
Come on.

582
00:50:49,046 --> 00:50:49,747
Go.

583
00:50:53,351 --> 00:50:55,253
Good idea of mine, eh, Terk?

584
00:51:01,326 --> 00:51:05,230
[Gunshots]

585
00:51:44,735 --> 00:51:48,639
[Cheering]

586
00:52:24,175 --> 00:52:25,276
She's in there.

587
00:52:25,376 --> 00:52:26,244
There she is.

588
00:52:26,344 --> 00:52:27,044
We got her.

589
00:52:27,144 --> 00:52:28,112
I told you it would work.

590
00:52:28,213 --> 00:52:30,248
I told you it would work.

591
00:52:30,348 --> 00:52:32,983
It's not her, it's the
sheriff, you dumb bastard.

592
00:52:33,083 --> 00:52:33,851
Yeah, but, Terk...

593
00:52:33,951 --> 00:52:34,719
Shut up, man.

594
00:55:21,986 --> 00:55:23,488
Looks good, Jake.

595
00:55:30,795 --> 00:55:32,997
Open it.

596
00:55:33,097 --> 00:55:36,534
This shows a lack of faith
in your fellow brother.

597
00:55:36,634 --> 00:55:39,437
When it comes to money,
I don't have any brothers.

598
00:55:43,374 --> 00:55:44,274
OK.

599
00:55:44,375 --> 00:55:46,210
Word on the street
is someone's been

600
00:55:46,310 --> 00:55:48,045
Selling some bad shit, man.

601
00:55:48,145 --> 00:55:49,947
Couple of kids died.

602
00:55:50,047 --> 00:55:51,482
This makes me look bad.

603
00:55:51,582 --> 00:55:53,250
Makes you look bad, huh?

604
00:55:53,350 --> 00:55:57,021
Cut 'em off, then
you raise the price.

605
00:55:57,121 --> 00:55:58,856
They just OD'ed man.

606
00:55:58,956 --> 00:55:59,924
What the fuck?

607
00:56:00,024 --> 00:56:02,627
You lost a couple
of kids, big deal.

608
00:56:07,164 --> 00:56:07,898
Keep 'em.

609
00:56:07,998 --> 00:56:10,167
They ain't mine.

610
00:56:10,267 --> 00:56:11,436
Get that shit out of there.

611
00:56:11,536 --> 00:56:13,938
White motherfucker stole
that car, fucking thief.

612
00:56:39,229 --> 00:56:42,600

613
00:57:06,123 --> 00:57:07,492

616
01:02:41,758 --> 01:02:42,659
Aye, Mongo.

617
01:02:42,759 --> 01:02:44,661
Mongo, come here,
man, look at this.

618
01:02:44,761 --> 01:02:46,296
Buck, come here, man.

619
01:02:46,396 --> 01:02:49,133
Get over here.

620
01:02:49,233 --> 01:02:52,536
Nice if you to drop by.

621
01:02:52,636 --> 01:02:55,639
Saved us a lot of time.

622
01:02:55,739 --> 01:02:58,142
Nice outfit.

623
01:02:58,242 --> 01:03:01,611
You can push me, but you
can only push me so far.

624
01:03:01,711 --> 01:03:03,914
Now, it's my turn.

625
01:03:04,014 --> 01:03:07,584
[Snaps]

626
01:03:08,485 --> 01:03:11,889
[Groan]

627
01:03:29,639 --> 01:03:30,340
Whoa.

628

Ach-yeah, ch-yeah, whoa,
karate, black belt, 15 years.

629

Ballet, six months.

630
01:03:45,255 --> 01:03:47,224
Ow.

631
01:03:47,324 --> 01:03:48,225
Get her.

632
01:03:48,325 --> 01:03:50,961
Get that bitch...

633
01:03:51,061 --> 01:03:51,761
Ah.

634
01:04:01,305 --> 01:04:03,673
You have disgraced me.

635
01:04:03,773 --> 01:04:05,642
Now, let's fight to the death.

636
01:04:17,354 --> 01:04:18,055
Argh.

637
01:04:21,825 --> 01:04:22,526
Ow.

638
01:04:34,538 --> 01:04:35,605
What the fuck was that?

639
01:04:35,705 --> 01:04:36,406
What?

640
01:04:36,506 --> 01:04:37,207
Huh?

641
01:04:37,307 --> 01:04:39,876
What?

642
01:04:39,977 --> 01:04:41,378
Get her.

643
01:04:41,478 --> 01:04:42,346
Oh, shit.

644
01:04:51,388 --> 01:04:52,789
Go, go, go.

645
01:04:52,889 --> 01:04:54,258
Come on, get the bitch, man.

646
01:04:54,358 --> 01:04:57,727
Get her, get her.

647
01:04:57,827 --> 01:04:58,795
Forget her, man.

648
01:04:58,895 --> 01:04:59,796
Let's split.

649
01:04:59,896 --> 01:05:01,165
Dump this whole operation, man.

650
01:05:01,265 --> 01:05:02,099
We've got enough money.

651
01:05:02,199 --> 01:05:03,767
No way, she's going to die.

652
01:05:03,867 --> 01:05:05,135
Listen to me.

653
01:05:05,235 --> 01:05:06,536
She's going to die, Terk.

654
01:05:06,636 --> 01:05:08,105
Listen to me,
she's going to die.

655
01:05:08,205 --> 01:05:09,106
Do you understand?

656
01:05:09,206 --> 01:05:10,607
She's going to die.

657
01:06:12,302 --> 01:06:13,003
Ah.

658
01:06:18,675 --> 01:06:19,543
Hey, assholes.

659
01:06:30,820 --> 01:06:31,521
Ah.

660
01:07:07,057 --> 01:07:09,759
That bitch, that
fucking bitch is dead.

661
01:07:09,859 --> 01:07:12,896
Oh, damn, man, she's pissed.

662
01:07:12,996 --> 01:07:14,964
Damn, she's mad.

663
01:07:15,065 --> 01:07:15,899
She's going to do us all.

664
01:07:15,999 --> 01:07:17,000
I told you, Apples.

665
01:07:17,101 --> 01:07:17,834
Shut up, Georgie.

666
01:07:17,934 --> 01:07:19,469
Both of you shut the fuck up.

667
01:07:19,569 --> 01:07:20,837
She's just one woman.

668
01:07:20,937 --> 01:07:22,005
How can she do this to us?

669
01:07:22,106 --> 01:07:23,073
Because she's pissed, man.

670
01:07:23,173 --> 01:07:24,508
That's how she's going
to do that to us.

671
01:07:24,608 --> 01:07:26,276
Shut the fuck up,
I'll clean it myself.

672
01:07:26,376 --> 01:07:27,511
Oh, she's pissed, man.

673
01:07:27,611 --> 01:07:29,813
She's going to do us all.

674
01:07:29,913 --> 01:07:32,182
Let's get the bitch
before she gets us.

675
01:07:32,282 --> 01:07:33,650
That's the way that
game is played.

676
01:07:33,750 --> 01:07:34,451
Let's go.

677
01:07:37,121 --> 01:07:39,656
Yeah, watch your feet though,
she's had ballet lessons.

678
01:07:39,756 --> 01:07:41,158
GEORGIE: She's going
to do us all, man.

679
01:08:37,414 --> 01:08:38,448
You're mine now.

680
01:08:41,318 --> 01:08:42,519
Easy 10 grand.

681
01:08:54,564 --> 01:08:56,166
Why share three ways?

682
01:08:56,266 --> 01:08:58,134
I'm gonna cut her ear off.

683
01:08:58,235 --> 01:08:59,803
I'm going to cut
the bitch's ear off.

684
01:08:59,903 --> 01:09:02,005
No, not yet.

685
01:09:02,105 --> 01:09:03,573
We're going to take
her back to the ranch

686
01:09:03,673 --> 01:09:06,776
And hang her right in the
middle of the courtyard.

687
01:09:06,876 --> 01:09:08,312
I'm going to cut
her ear off first.

688
01:09:08,412 --> 01:09:11,848
I don't give a
fuck what you say.

689
01:09:11,948 --> 01:09:14,017
You see this?

690
01:09:14,117 --> 01:09:15,285
She's going to pay.

691
01:09:15,385 --> 01:09:16,386
She's going to pay for this.

692
01:09:16,486 --> 01:09:18,355
Back at the ranch,
she can pay for that.

693
01:09:18,455 --> 01:09:20,657
Georgia, listen to me.

694
01:09:20,757 --> 01:09:22,392
If we cut her ear
off now, she's going

695
01:09:22,492 --> 01:09:24,160
To get sick, throw
up, and pass out,

696
01:09:24,261 --> 01:09:26,095
And we'll have to carry or.

697
01:09:26,196 --> 01:09:29,666
Do you want to carry
her back to the ranch?

698
01:09:29,766 --> 01:09:32,469
Fuck no, you don't.

699
01:09:32,569 --> 01:09:33,470
Get that rope.

700
01:10:02,732 --> 01:10:04,901
Heh, I don't know
what the big deal was

701
01:10:05,001 --> 01:10:06,336
Because she ain't that tough.

702
01:10:06,436 --> 01:10:07,136
What?

703
01:10:07,237 --> 01:10:08,772
What did you say?

704
01:10:08,872 --> 01:10:10,340
I don't know what
the big deal was.

705
01:10:10,440 --> 01:10:11,675
She ain't that tough.

706
01:10:11,775 --> 01:10:15,144
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

707
01:10:15,245 --> 01:10:16,112
What the...

708
01:10:16,212 --> 01:10:17,614
It's a trick.
It's a trick.

709
01:10:17,714 --> 01:10:18,582
She's going to do something.

710
01:10:18,682 --> 01:10:20,083
Bitch will trick you.

711
01:10:20,183 --> 01:10:21,551
Ah.

712
01:10:21,651 --> 01:10:23,152
I knew it.
I knew it.

713
01:10:23,253 --> 01:10:24,053
I knew it.

714
01:10:38,001 --> 01:10:38,902
She hurt me.

715
01:10:42,939 --> 01:10:45,174
Damn it, I knew something
like this was going to happen.

716
01:10:45,275 --> 01:10:48,878
I knew it, I knew it.

717
01:10:48,978 --> 01:10:52,015
Well, well, little lady.

718
01:10:52,115 --> 01:10:54,584
Do you know what time it is?

719
01:10:54,684 --> 01:10:56,420
It's time to die.

720
01:10:56,520 --> 01:10:58,455
I wouldn't come any
closer if I were you.

721
01:10:58,555 --> 01:10:59,423
Why?

722
01:10:59,523 --> 01:11:01,925
Are you going to
scratch out my eyes?

723
01:11:02,025 --> 01:11:03,527
Heh-heh-heh.

724
01:11:03,627 --> 01:11:04,828
No.

725
01:11:04,928 --> 01:11:10,066
This place is booby trapped
and you're going to die.

726
01:11:10,166 --> 01:11:11,501
She's going to do us.

727
01:11:11,601 --> 01:11:12,702
She's going to do us all, man.

728
01:11:15,772 --> 01:11:18,708
You're lying.

729
01:11:18,808 --> 01:11:21,345
It's time for you to die, lady.

730
01:11:21,445 --> 01:11:23,046
Say your last words.

731
01:11:23,146 --> 01:11:24,781
You squat when you pee?

732
01:11:24,881 --> 01:11:25,582
Ah.

733
01:11:39,596 --> 01:11:43,199
I knew something like
this was going to happen.

734
01:11:43,299 --> 01:11:45,702
Apples, man, you OK?

735
01:12:00,283 --> 01:12:02,686
Shit, man.

736
01:12:02,786 --> 01:12:04,053
We're supposed to
be the bad guys.

737
01:12:24,774 --> 01:12:29,646
Oh, shit, I ain't
doing too good.

738
01:12:29,746 --> 01:12:30,847
Not too good at all.

739
01:12:38,588 --> 01:12:39,288
Bitch.

740
01:12:55,338 --> 01:12:58,107
OK, Terk, you're right.

741
01:12:58,207 --> 01:13:00,176
We'll get back to the
ranch and pack up.

742
01:13:00,276 --> 01:13:03,747
Yeah, I had enough
of this crap.

743
01:13:03,847 --> 01:13:06,450
Get Mr. Wilson to split the
money and we're out of here.

744
01:13:06,550 --> 01:13:08,885
That crazy broad did
one good thing for us.

745
01:13:08,985 --> 01:13:10,920
There's less people we have
to share the money with.

746
01:13:11,020 --> 01:13:14,323
Yeah, the less survivors,
the more money we get.

747
01:13:14,424 --> 01:13:15,759
That's the way
the game's played.

748
01:13:15,859 --> 01:13:18,227
Yeah, we in, they lose.

749
01:13:23,933 --> 01:13:26,570
Terk, go to the way up and
pack up the rest of the drugs

750
01:13:26,670 --> 01:13:27,804
That are ready for sale.

751
01:13:27,904 --> 01:13:30,273
Yeah, we don't want to
cut us short of any money.

752
01:13:30,373 --> 01:13:32,408
I'll go to the house, pick
up the rest of the cash.

753
01:13:32,509 --> 01:13:34,377
I hope Mr. Wilson
will be here soon

754
01:13:34,478 --> 01:13:35,278
With the rest of the money.

755
01:13:35,378 --> 01:13:36,279
Let's do it.

756
01:13:36,379 --> 01:13:37,280
Let's go.

757
01:14:52,756 --> 01:14:53,923
What's going on here?

758
01:14:54,023 --> 01:14:54,891
Where's everybody at?

759
01:14:54,991 --> 01:14:55,992
They're dead, man.

760
01:14:56,092 --> 01:14:58,862
She killed them all
except for me and Mongo.

761
01:14:58,962 --> 01:15:00,129
You're stupid, man.

762
01:15:00,229 --> 01:15:02,365
You're all fucked
up, all of you.

763
01:15:02,465 --> 01:15:04,934
I told you to get
rid of that bitch.

764
01:15:05,034 --> 01:15:06,235
I did my job.

765
01:15:06,335 --> 01:15:07,136
I got the cash.

766
01:15:07,236 --> 01:15:08,337
Now you do yours.

767
01:15:08,437 --> 01:15:09,606
It's too late, man.

768
01:15:09,706 --> 01:15:10,907
It's not too late.

769
01:15:11,007 --> 01:15:12,876
I need my share of the LA sale.

770
01:15:12,976 --> 01:15:14,343
Get rid of that bitch now.

771
01:15:14,443 --> 01:15:16,913
I said forget it,
man, it's too late.

772
01:15:17,013 --> 01:15:21,851
No, get rid of
her now, damn you.

773
01:15:21,951 --> 01:15:23,853
How about I get
rid of you, asshole?

774
01:16:03,526 --> 01:16:06,462
I'm back.

775
01:16:06,562 --> 01:16:07,463
So what?

776
01:16:13,536 --> 01:16:14,437
Ah.

777
01:16:14,537 --> 01:16:16,139
You bitch.

778
01:16:16,239 --> 01:16:16,940
Ah.

779
01:16:22,511 --> 01:16:25,581
[Screaming]

780
01:16:46,770 --> 01:16:47,470
Ah.

781
01:17:45,294 --> 01:17:45,995
Ah.

782
01:17:52,802 --> 01:17:53,502
No.

783
01:18:50,693 --> 01:18:51,394
Yes.

784
01:19:18,487 --> 01:19:21,090
Yes, woo.

785
01:19:32,902 --> 01:19:36,139
