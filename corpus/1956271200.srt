2
00:00:06,190 --> 00:00:07,730
Who are we talking about?

3
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:08,860
Oh!

4
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:12,030
Yeah, that little fish who crossed the ocean to find her parents.

5
00:00:12,110 --> 00:00:14,450
Her parents!

6
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:18,120
Oh, yeah. no, no, I've known her since she was a cute little guppy.

7
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:21,870
When I meet her, I don't know,
I got a strange first impression.

8
00:00:21,950 --> 00:00:24,120
I will be honest, the second impression wasn't much better.

9
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:25,660
Well, I don't ...

10
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:29,790
Look, I don't want to brag, but I could sense her before I saw her

11
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:30,880
No, I'm not kidding

12
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:33,800
Yes, I have this thing called echolocation.

13
00:00:34,470 --> 00:00:35,590
Well, it's ...

14
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:38,510
You know what, rather than explaining it, I can give you a little

15
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:41,680
Sure. Uhh, if you could just give me a little bit of room

16
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:43,180
Thank you so much.

17
00:00:45,890 --> 00:00:47,440
Okay.

18
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:50,150
She never said any mean word to me

19
00:00:50,230 --> 00:00:51,730
- Always good.
- Always good.

20
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:54,740
- Always forgiving.
- Always forgiving.

21
00:00:54,820 --> 00:00:56,740
- You know, giant heart.
- Giant heart.

22
00:00:56,820 --> 00:00:57,820
Yeah.

23
00:00:57,950 --> 00:01:00,160
Okay, here we go

24
00:01:02,990 --> 00:01:03,990
Just a second

25
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:06,960
Just a second

26
00:01:08,330 --> 00:01:09,330
This never happens

27
00:01:09,830 --> 00:01:10,830
Somebody wearing metal?

28
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:13,670
You know, it's funny, I thought she didn't likes me at first

29
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:15,590
because she could never remember my name

30
00:01:15,670 --> 00:01:17,720
But then I realized she never remembered anyone's name.

31
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:20,050
You have got to want it.

32
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:22,350
You got to want it. Get in there

33
00:01:23,810 --> 00:01:24,810
Here we go.

34
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:27,430
Now, I'm feeling it. And there it goes.

35
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:29,270
I don't know what's happening, and I apologize.

36
00:01:29,350 --> 00:01:32,270
Here's the thing though. I don't usually don't care for upbeats so much.

37
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:34,480
But she grew on me, okay

38
00:01:34,570 --> 00:01:36,400
She tends to grow on you, whether you like it or not.

39
00:01:36,490 --> 00:01:38,110
I am quite large.

40
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:39,910
She used to play hide-and-seek in my mouth

41
00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:41,530
Olly, olly oxen free.

42
00:01:41,620 --> 00:01:43,370
Um, I don't remember any of that
