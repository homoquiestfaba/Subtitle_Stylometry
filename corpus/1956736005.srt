1
00:01:05,274 --> 00:01:07,943
Morning, brothers and sisters.

2
00:01:07,943 --> 00:01:11,822
Thank you for such
a beautiful start to the day.

3
00:01:11,822 --> 00:01:15,492
I've been thinking
a lot about this life.

4
00:01:15,492 --> 00:01:19,329
Last night, one of my
former mission companions

5
00:01:19,329 --> 00:01:21,164
passed away.

6
00:01:22,791 --> 00:01:25,836
He had been
struggling with demons,

7
00:01:25,836 --> 00:01:27,879
not attending church.

8
00:01:27,879 --> 00:01:30,257
The last time
I spoke with him,

9
00:01:30,257 --> 00:01:34,845
I reminded him that
our Heavenly Father loves us

10
00:01:34,845 --> 00:01:38,724
and He wants us to
spend eternity with Him

11
00:01:38,724 --> 00:01:41,184
and our families.

12
00:01:41,184 --> 00:01:44,855
But, that is a privilege,
one we must earn

13
00:01:44,855 --> 00:01:46,815
by living the way
He wants us to.

14
00:01:46,815 --> 00:01:48,859
By making
the right choices.

15
00:01:48,859 --> 00:01:51,194
My heart aches for him,

16
00:01:51,194 --> 00:01:53,447
and the regret
he must feel right now,

17
00:01:53,447 --> 00:01:56,616
knowing that he might
be alone forever.

18
00:01:56,616 --> 00:01:59,286
I ache even more
for his wife and children,

19
00:01:59,286 --> 00:02:03,165
they'll never see him again.

20
00:02:03,165 --> 00:02:05,751
I share this
to remind each of us,

21
00:02:05,751 --> 00:02:08,837
that every day
we have breath in our lungs,

22
00:02:08,837 --> 00:02:12,841
we have an opportunity to look
inward and ask ourselves,

23
00:02:12,841 --> 00:02:14,593
"Are the choices we're making

24
00:02:14,593 --> 00:02:17,888
bringing us closer
to the Celestial Kingdom,

25
00:02:17,888 --> 00:02:20,223
or further away?"

26
00:02:21,475 --> 00:02:24,478
There's nothing in this life,
no matter how tempting,

27
00:02:24,478 --> 00:02:27,147
is worth losing
eternity in the next.

28
00:02:28,815 --> 00:02:31,985
We in the Bishop Brick
are here if you need us.

29
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:35,030
We love you.

30
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:37,908
In the name
of Jesus Christ, Amen.

31
00:02:37,908 --> 00:02:39,493
Amen.

32
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:47,751
You promised you'd help me.

33
00:02:47,751 --> 00:02:49,878
They're garbage bins,
what's to decorate?

34
00:02:49,878 --> 00:02:51,963
If they don't say
recycling on them,

35
00:02:51,963 --> 00:02:53,882
people will think
they're trash.

36
00:02:53,882 --> 00:02:55,467
Plus, they
should like nice.

37
00:02:55,467 --> 00:02:58,929
Like hey, use me,
save the planet.

38
00:02:58,929 --> 00:03:00,097
It's 90 degrees outside,

39
00:03:00,097 --> 00:03:02,265
can't we save
the planet another day?

40
00:03:02,265 --> 00:03:05,519
I told Mr. Puma I'd have
them ready for Earth Week.

41
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:09,189
The mall's air conditioned
and we can get fro-yo,

42
00:03:09,189 --> 00:03:11,942
chocolate drizzle and chocolate
chips in a waffle cone.

43
00:03:18,824 --> 00:03:20,909
Earth to Alex?

44
00:03:20,909 --> 00:03:22,411
Since when do you
like them?

45
00:03:22,411 --> 00:03:24,788
What, who?

46
00:03:24,788 --> 00:03:26,957
Oh my gosh, you're as subtle
as a fart in a bathtub.

47
00:03:26,957 --> 00:03:29,960
The meatheads,
you were drooling.

48
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:32,879
They're cute, so what?

49
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:34,798
I wasn't drooling.

50
00:03:34,798 --> 00:03:37,926
Recycling bins this week,
I buy froyo next week.

51
00:03:37,926 --> 00:03:40,429
Fine, but we're
going to my house.

52
00:03:40,429 --> 00:03:43,223
Someone should invent
a portable cloud machine.

53
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:44,975
Something to block
my face from the sun.

54
00:03:44,975 --> 00:03:46,977
Or, you could try
a baseball cap.

55
00:03:50,105 --> 00:03:53,775
Hey, what are
you guys working on?

56
00:03:53,775 --> 00:03:56,236
Alex is doing her recycling
drive for Earth Week.

57
00:03:56,236 --> 00:03:58,488
Cool, you guys
remember Collette?

58
00:03:58,488 --> 00:04:00,073
Yep.

59
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:06,997
Okay.

60
00:04:06,997 --> 00:04:08,957
That's Hannah's
girlfriend.

61
00:04:08,957 --> 00:04:11,585
Like, girlfriend
girlfriend.

62
00:04:11,585 --> 00:04:14,796
I mean, can you imagine
if our parents found out?

63
00:04:14,796 --> 00:04:17,257
I'm sorry.

64
00:04:19,009 --> 00:04:20,469
Guys, this is Frankie.

65
00:04:20,469 --> 00:04:22,387
Frankie this is my sister
Daniella and her friend Alex.

66
00:04:24,139 --> 00:04:26,057
- Hi.
- Hi, yourself.

67
00:04:28,018 --> 00:04:29,978
Hannah, are your friends
staying for dinner?

68
00:04:29,978 --> 00:04:31,396
Yeah, is that okay?

69
00:04:31,396 --> 00:04:34,941
The more the merrier.
Alex, what about you?

70
00:04:34,941 --> 00:04:38,528
Sure, great. Sure.

71
00:04:47,788 --> 00:04:49,164
- Hi again.
- Hi.

72
00:04:49,164 --> 00:04:52,584
I'm Alex Cooper.

73
00:04:52,584 --> 00:04:56,713
Alex Cooper,
in case you didn't... um...

74
00:04:56,713 --> 00:04:58,215
I've never seen you
at school before.

75
00:04:58,215 --> 00:04:59,633
Are you over at Silverado?

76
00:04:59,633 --> 00:05:02,052
I was, yeah.
I graduated last year.

77
00:05:02,052 --> 00:05:04,387
Oh, cool, yeah.
I'm graduating soon, too.

78
00:05:04,387 --> 00:05:08,016
I mean, I'm a sophomore,

79
00:05:08,016 --> 00:05:09,976
so soon is relative.

80
00:05:09,976 --> 00:05:13,063
But, given the age of universe,
it's practically like tomorrow.

81
00:05:13,063 --> 00:05:14,314
Future scientist?

82
00:05:16,691 --> 00:05:18,819
- Lawyer.
- Ah.

83
00:05:18,819 --> 00:05:20,904
I want to live in
New York in one of those

84
00:05:20,904 --> 00:05:22,239
Sex In The City penthouses

85
00:05:22,239 --> 00:05:24,074
and have a driver
take me to work every day.

86
00:05:25,492 --> 00:05:27,077
That sounded totally lame.

87
00:05:27,077 --> 00:05:28,829
No, I was gonna say fancy.

88
00:05:30,831 --> 00:05:32,457
What about you?

89
00:05:32,457 --> 00:05:35,252
I dunno,
I haven't figured it out.

90
00:05:35,252 --> 00:05:37,546
I can't think of anything
that I'd actually want to do

91
00:05:37,546 --> 00:05:39,631
for the rest
of my life.

92
00:05:39,631 --> 00:05:41,174
Travel maybe?

93
00:05:41,174 --> 00:05:43,593
Backpack or first class?

94
00:05:43,593 --> 00:05:46,179
Backpack. You?

95
00:05:47,222 --> 00:05:49,099
Both, I guess.

96
00:05:49,099 --> 00:05:50,851
No, you have to pick one.

97
00:05:50,851 --> 00:05:53,144
Okay, first class.

98
00:05:53,144 --> 00:05:55,230
Snow or tropical?

99
00:05:55,230 --> 00:05:57,023
- Snow.
- Tropical.

100
00:05:58,650 --> 00:05:59,943
Hotel or home?

101
00:05:59,943 --> 00:06:01,862
- Home.
- Home.

102
00:06:01,862 --> 00:06:03,071
But not in Victorville.

103
00:06:03,071 --> 00:06:05,365
Definitely not, no.

104
00:06:08,869 --> 00:06:11,079
So, how do you know
Hannah and Collette?

105
00:06:11,079 --> 00:06:14,791
I met them
at a rave in LA.

106
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:16,877
Same night they met
each other, actually.

107
00:06:20,130 --> 00:06:22,215
I hear Colette's gay.

108
00:06:22,215 --> 00:06:24,801
Does that bother you?

109
00:06:24,801 --> 00:06:27,095
No, not at all.

110
00:06:27,095 --> 00:06:29,222
It's fine, whatever.

111
00:06:29,222 --> 00:06:31,892
Good, cause I am too

112
00:06:31,892 --> 00:06:33,810

we could be friends.

are all about love,

why does Daniella care
if her sister's happy?

130
00:07:32,202 --> 00:07:34,537
It's complicated.

131
00:07:34,537 --> 00:07:38,208
Have you ever
been religious?

132
00:07:38,208 --> 00:07:40,960
Oh my God, you're not going
to try to convert me are you?

133
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:44,381
No, I was just curious.

134
00:07:44,381 --> 00:07:47,050
I like churches,
like the ones in Europe

135
00:07:47,050 --> 00:07:48,635
that are centuries old.

136
00:07:48,635 --> 00:07:52,639
I see pictures them
and I feel, I dunno, quiet.

137
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:56,184
I think if I ever visited one,
I'd probably pitch a tent

138
00:07:56,184 --> 00:07:57,852
in the back
and never leave.

139
00:07:57,852 --> 00:08:00,230
Why don't you go
visit those churches?

140
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:02,524
You're done with school.

141
00:08:02,524 --> 00:08:05,318
My mom needs me. Someday.

142
00:08:09,072 --> 00:08:11,032
Hey, I really can't stomach
the pizza in this place.

143
00:08:11,032 --> 00:08:13,576
Are you guys up for the buffet
or the burger joint?

144
00:08:13,576 --> 00:08:15,245
- We can do tacos again?
- Let's go to LA.

145
00:08:15,245 --> 00:08:16,955
What?

146
00:08:16,955 --> 00:08:19,082
Like, right now, why not?

147
00:08:19,082 --> 00:08:21,376
Because it's two
and a half hours away

148
00:08:21,376 --> 00:08:23,670
and I have a history
test on Monday.

149
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:26,673
Plus, you'd be grounded
for like five years.

150

Collette?

00:08:28,216 --> 00:08:30,760

You know what I mean.

Let's pretend we're
on a deserted island.

174
00:10:11,945 --> 00:10:15,323
Just you, me
and some coconut trees.

175
00:10:15,323 --> 00:10:20,328
We can't live
entirely on coconuts.

176
00:10:20,328 --> 00:10:23,289
Okay, you and me,
some coconut trees

177
00:10:23,289 --> 00:10:26,501
and a personal chef
to cook us whatever we want.

178
00:10:26,501 --> 00:10:30,380
But he stays on the other
side of the island, right?

179
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:32,132
We don't want
him hovering.

180
00:10:32,132 --> 00:10:33,883
Yeah, of course not,
that would just be weird.

181
00:10:38,388 --> 00:10:40,598
We can have this, Alex.

182
00:10:40,598 --> 00:10:43,476
All you have to do
is say yes.

183
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:51,234
Yes.

184
00:11:21,431 --> 00:11:23,099
What's going on?

185
00:11:23,099 --> 00:11:25,018
I'll assume this is her, then?

186
00:11:31,441 --> 00:11:33,735
I'll leave you to it.

187
00:11:33,735 --> 00:11:35,570
Thank you for
your help, officer.

188
00:11:35,570 --> 00:11:37,197
No problem.

189
00:11:40,783 --> 00:11:43,536
I didn't mean to
worry you guys.

190
00:11:43,536 --> 00:11:44,704
I left a note.

191
00:11:44,704 --> 00:11:46,748
Don't disrespect us
by lying any more

192
00:11:46,748 --> 00:11:48,499
than you already have.

193
00:11:48,499 --> 00:11:50,752
Your mother called
Sister Lopez.

194
00:11:50,752 --> 00:11:54,297
Daniella said you
went into the city.

195
00:11:54,297 --> 00:11:56,299
Were you at a party?

196
00:11:56,299 --> 00:11:57,800
No.

197
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,344
Was there any
alcohol there?

198
00:11:59,344 --> 00:12:01,095
Were there boys?

199
00:12:01,095 --> 00:12:02,472
I'm not a kid, Mom.

200
00:12:02,472 --> 00:12:03,932
So, that's a yes.

201
00:12:03,932 --> 00:12:07,477
I'm not doing
anything stupid.

202
00:12:07,477 --> 00:12:09,229
I can take care of myself.

203
00:12:09,229 --> 00:12:12,440
Is ditching school
taking care of yourself?

204
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:14,442
And last year
with the pot smoking?

205
00:12:14,442 --> 00:12:16,236
I said I was sorry.

206
00:12:16,236 --> 00:12:20,615
If you were sorry, you wouldn't
keep putting yourself in danger.

207
00:12:20,615 --> 00:12:23,493
We were up all night.

208
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:29,249
To school and back
until further notice.

209
00:12:41,511 --> 00:12:43,513
I heard you were
grounded for life.

210
00:12:43,513 --> 00:12:45,515
Daniella won't
even talk to me.

211
00:12:45,515 --> 00:12:47,809
She said she
was really worried.

212
00:12:47,809 --> 00:12:50,478
She doesn't like Frankie,
or Colette by the way.

213
00:12:50,478 --> 00:12:52,272
I know.

214
00:12:54,482 --> 00:12:55,900
Are you gay?

215
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:59,946
No, no, Colette's
just one time.

216
00:12:59,946 --> 00:13:02,490
I'll meet a return missionary
and get married in the temple

217
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:04,367
and have kids
like everyone else.

218
00:13:07,537 --> 00:13:10,081
Why? Are you?

219
00:13:10,081 --> 00:13:13,543
No. No way, no.

220
00:13:13,543 --> 00:13:17,297
I should go,
Daniella's waiting.

221
00:14:15,521 --> 00:14:18,024
What if your mom
needs something?

222
00:14:18,024 --> 00:14:20,693
Once she's asleep,
she's out until dawn at least.

223
00:14:20,693 --> 00:14:23,112
I'm always up
before she is, anyway.

224
00:14:32,121 --> 00:14:35,166
I'm really glad
you're here.

225
00:14:36,584 --> 00:14:38,211
Me too.

226
00:14:47,345 --> 00:14:51,849
Just so you know,
I've never done this before.

227
00:14:51,849 --> 00:14:56,395
I don't need this
to like you, Alex.

228
00:14:56,395 --> 00:14:58,106
You're smart
and funny

229
00:14:58,106 --> 00:15:01,400
and you bowl
for, but...

230
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:03,027
I do not.

231
00:15:03,027 --> 00:15:05,154
You set a world record
for most gutter balls.

232
00:15:05,154 --> 00:15:08,324
Which is still an achievement,
thank you very much.

233
00:15:11,077 --> 00:15:13,496
All I'm saying is,
we can just hang out.

234
00:15:13,496 --> 00:15:15,832
I like being with you.

235
00:15:15,832 --> 00:15:19,669
I don't want to
just hang out.

236
00:15:19,669 --> 00:15:22,505
What happens on Sunday?

237
00:15:25,716 --> 00:15:27,176
I don't want you
sitting in church

238
00:15:27,176 --> 00:15:28,845
feeling horrible
because of me.

239
00:15:34,183 --> 00:15:35,393
I won't.

240
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:40,606
If I do,
I'll get over it.

241
00:15:43,067 --> 00:15:44,277
Alex.

242
00:15:49,699 --> 00:15:52,869
I know I'm not

243
00:15:52,869 --> 00:15:55,538
supposed to feel this way

244
00:15:55,538 --> 00:15:59,750
but it feels right.

245
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:03,588
You feel right.

246
00:16:06,174 --> 00:16:08,384
I don't know
what that means, but...

247
00:16:08,384 --> 00:16:11,971
I have to believe
I met you for a reason.

248
00:16:28,738 --> 00:16:30,615
It's noon, get dressed.

249
00:16:42,501 --> 00:16:44,003
Where were you last night?

250
00:16:45,421 --> 00:16:46,923
Was it that boy again?

251
00:16:46,923 --> 00:16:48,507
The one you snuck
out with before?

252
00:16:48,507 --> 00:16:49,759
No.

253
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:51,928
I assume he's
a non-member.

254
00:16:51,928 --> 00:16:53,930
Can we please
just drop it?

255
00:16:53,930 --> 00:16:55,806
Your mother asked
you a question.

256
00:16:55,806 --> 00:16:57,683
I don't want to
talk about it.

257
00:17:01,771 --> 00:17:04,106
Are you having sex, Alex?

258
00:17:04,106 --> 00:17:07,360
- What?
- Your neck.

259
00:17:10,947 --> 00:17:13,950
Does he know what this
behaviour could cost you?

260
00:17:13,950 --> 00:17:17,745
Does he have any idea
all that you have to lose?

261
00:17:17,745 --> 00:17:19,622
It's not what
you guys think.

262
00:17:19,622 --> 00:17:21,123
Then what is it, Alex?

263
00:17:21,123 --> 00:17:23,084
Because frankly,
we have no idea.

264
00:17:23,084 --> 00:17:24,877
It was a girl, okay?

265
00:17:35,471 --> 00:17:36,889
I like girls.

266
00:17:46,816 --> 00:17:49,569
No, you don't.

267
00:17:52,196 --> 00:17:53,489
I do.

268
00:17:55,741 --> 00:17:58,744
I'm sorry, but I do.

269
00:18:14,677 --> 00:18:15,928
Mom?

270
00:18:17,972 --> 00:18:19,432
Get out of this house.

271
00:18:26,856 --> 00:18:28,357
Go!

272
00:18:45,499 --> 00:18:48,794
I told them I like girls
and they kicked me out.

273
00:18:48,794 --> 00:18:51,130
, Alex I'm so sorry.

274
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:52,715
You can stay with me.

275
00:18:52,715 --> 00:18:54,383
No, they know you're 18.

276
00:18:54,383 --> 00:18:56,844
They want to
know who you are.

277
00:18:56,844 --> 00:18:58,554
Oh my God,
they want to arrest me?

278
00:18:58,554 --> 00:19:01,265
They just need time to adjust,
they're scared.

279
00:19:01,265 --> 00:19:02,892
Alex.

280
00:19:02,892 --> 00:19:04,852
I haven't told them
anything and I won't.

281
00:19:04,852 --> 00:19:06,729
I promise.

282
00:19:06,729 --> 00:19:09,065
Everything's
gonna be okay.

283
00:19:09,065 --> 00:19:11,859
It'll all blow over,
trust me.

284
00:19:11,859 --> 00:19:14,278
Frankie!

285
00:19:14,278 --> 00:19:16,197
, I have to
get back in to work.

286
00:19:16,197 --> 00:19:17,823
I'll talk to you soon.

287
00:19:28,501 --> 00:19:31,170
I'm...

288
00:19:32,755 --> 00:19:36,258
I don't really think
I have a home anymore, so...

289
00:20:18,718 --> 00:20:19,760
We thank thee for the food

290
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:20,970
we are about to eat

291
00:20:20,970 --> 00:20:22,930
and the blessings we
share as a family.

292
00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:25,057
In the name
of Jesus Christ, Amen.

293
00:20:25,057 --> 00:20:26,726
Amen.

294
00:20:30,813 --> 00:20:34,650
Alex, I spoke with
your parents last night.

295
00:20:37,903 --> 00:20:38,946
They asked about me?

296
00:20:38,946 --> 00:20:41,031
They did.

297
00:20:41,031 --> 00:20:42,992
They didn't want us
to tell you,

298
00:20:42,992 --> 00:20:45,494
but we thought we should.

299
00:20:45,494 --> 00:20:47,872
They're coming to
pick you up this morning.

300
00:20:47,872 --> 00:20:49,081
They're taking you to Utah

301
00:20:49,081 --> 00:20:51,542
to stay with your
grandparents for a while.

302
00:20:51,542 --> 00:20:56,005
Oh, okay.

303
00:20:56,005 --> 00:20:59,008
Well, on the upside
you guys get your couch back.

304
00:21:02,011 --> 00:21:03,220
They're early.

305
00:21:09,685 --> 00:21:11,937
- Hello.
- Hi.

306
00:21:11,937 --> 00:21:14,940
We're just having
breakfast here.

307
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:16,358
Okay.

308
00:21:20,946 --> 00:21:22,531
Time to go, Alex.

309
00:21:34,210 --> 00:21:37,129
Is anyone
going to talk to me?

310
00:21:40,049 --> 00:21:41,175
You'll be staying
with your grandparents

311
00:21:41,175 --> 00:21:42,551
for a couple of weeks, honey.

312
00:22:06,575 --> 00:22:08,661
I need to use
the restroom.

313
00:22:10,454 --> 00:22:11,497
Okay.

314
00:22:15,042 --> 00:22:16,252
Hey.

315
00:22:16,252 --> 00:22:18,170
Hey, why are you whispering?

316
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:21,090
I don't have much time,
I'm on my way to Utah.

317
00:22:21,090 --> 00:22:22,633
What?

318
00:22:22,633 --> 00:22:24,385
They're having me spend
a few weeks at my grandparents.

319
00:22:24,385 --> 00:22:26,804
They're that traumatized?

320
00:22:26,804 --> 00:22:28,097
Frankie.

321
00:22:28,097 --> 00:22:31,058
I know, I'm sorry. Utah?

322
00:22:31,058 --> 00:22:32,226
It'll be fine.

323
00:22:32,226 --> 00:22:34,270
I used to spend my
summers out there.

324
00:22:34,270 --> 00:22:35,855
I'm their favourite
grandkid.

325
00:22:35,855 --> 00:22:40,484
I'm not sure how much
I'll be able to call,

326
00:22:40,484 --> 00:22:42,319
given that you are
the devil that dragged me

327
00:22:42,319 --> 00:22:44,113
out of the celestial
kingdom by my vagina.

328
00:22:46,282 --> 00:22:49,702
And listen,
you don't have to...

329
00:22:49,702 --> 00:22:53,122
I mean, if you
meet someone cool.

330
00:22:53,122 --> 00:22:55,708
Uh, I did already,
so shut up about it.

331
00:22:58,961 --> 00:23:00,713
See you in
a few weeks then?

332
00:23:00,713 --> 00:23:02,673
Yeah, I'll see you
in a few weeks.

333
00:23:33,704 --> 00:23:35,414
Where are we?

334
00:23:41,837 --> 00:23:44,757
Why are grandma
and grandpa here?

335
00:23:47,176 --> 00:23:49,261
Dad, who's house is this?

336
00:23:51,180 --> 00:23:52,806
Mom, what's happening?

337
00:23:52,806 --> 00:23:54,016
Mom?

338
00:23:54,016 --> 00:23:56,727
Dad, are you gonna let me
know what's going on?

339
00:24:05,027 --> 00:24:06,695
Why are you
taking my stuff?

340
00:24:10,574 --> 00:24:12,034
Dad?

341
00:24:22,586 --> 00:24:24,296
Come on, come on, come on.

342
00:24:37,935 --> 00:24:40,104
Don't make this harder
than it needs to be.

343
00:24:42,231 --> 00:24:44,191
Alex, I'm Tiana Simms,

344
00:24:44,191 --> 00:24:46,527
this is my husband, Johnny.

345
00:24:46,527 --> 00:24:49,488
What am I doing here?

346
00:24:52,533 --> 00:24:57,496
We've been
thinking and um...

347
00:24:57,496 --> 00:25:00,791
We're just so worried
about you, sweetheart.

348
00:25:03,085 --> 00:25:05,379
You're at an age where
you think you know things

349
00:25:05,379 --> 00:25:07,589
that you don't, and...

350
00:25:07,589 --> 00:25:10,592
And there are
consequences.

351
00:25:10,592 --> 00:25:14,263
You need to
change course, Alex.

352
00:25:14,263 --> 00:25:17,016
So you're going to be staying
with the Simms for a while.

353
00:25:17,016 --> 00:25:18,517
What?

354
00:25:18,517 --> 00:25:21,020
They've helped
people like you before.

355
00:25:22,896 --> 00:25:26,483
You mean,
people who like girls?

356
00:25:30,279 --> 00:25:32,364
You can be here
three months

357
00:25:32,364 --> 00:25:34,283
or you can be here three years,
it's up to you.

358
00:25:34,283 --> 00:25:35,576
Three years?

359
00:25:35,576 --> 00:25:37,578
Like Johnny said,
it is up to you.

360
00:25:37,578 --> 00:25:39,413
Work the program,
get better,

361
00:25:39,413 --> 00:25:40,706
you'll be home
before you know it.

362
00:25:40,706 --> 00:25:42,708
No, no way,
I'm not doing this.

363
00:25:42,708 --> 00:25:44,710
It's not your choice to make.

364
00:25:46,336 --> 00:25:49,298
So you know, Tiana
and I have both served

365
00:25:49,298 --> 00:25:51,341
in the juvenile system
here in town.

366
00:25:51,341 --> 00:25:52,718
Which means we
know everybody.

367
00:25:52,718 --> 00:25:56,138
Police, schools, courts,
they all know us and trust us.

368
00:25:56,138 --> 00:25:59,099
And they know we take in
troubled kids like you.

369
00:25:59,099 --> 00:26:02,394
So, you won't get away with
any of your usual nonsense here.

370
00:26:04,688 --> 00:26:08,358
Mom, please don't do this.

371
00:26:10,110 --> 00:26:11,737
Dad.

372
00:26:11,737 --> 00:26:14,490
You can't let them
leave me here.

373
00:26:14,490 --> 00:26:16,325
We can't let you just
fall away, honey.

374
00:26:16,325 --> 00:26:17,326
If you were drowning.

375
00:26:17,326 --> 00:26:19,453
I'm not, I'm not drowning. Mom!

376
00:26:19,453 --> 00:26:21,246
- Do you have the papers?
- What papers?

377
00:26:22,956 --> 00:26:25,250
What are those?
Are those about me?

378
00:26:26,877 --> 00:26:28,712
You're our
responsibility now.

379
00:26:28,712 --> 00:26:30,005
What?

380
00:26:30,005 --> 00:26:33,133
No, these people
are complete strangers.

381
00:26:33,133 --> 00:26:34,802
You're not seriously
leaving me here with them.

382
00:26:34,802 --> 00:26:37,888
No, Dad, you can't leave.
You don't know them!

383
00:26:37,888 --> 00:26:39,306
Mom, mom, mom.

384
00:26:39,306 --> 00:26:41,600
Please don't leave.

385
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:43,268
No, mom please!

386
00:26:43,268 --> 00:26:45,521
Please don't leave me,
please no!

387
00:26:50,317 --> 00:26:52,111
Let's go.

388
00:27:00,327 --> 00:27:01,954
Immodest.

389
00:27:06,041 --> 00:27:08,710
This is just
asking for trouble.

390
00:27:10,170 --> 00:27:11,713
None of these.

391
00:27:11,713 --> 00:27:13,966
No wonder
you're here with us.

392
00:27:13,966 --> 00:27:16,051
No phones, either.

393
00:27:18,345 --> 00:27:21,223
These are the clothes you'll
wear while you stay with us.

394
00:27:29,481 --> 00:27:31,233
Okay.

395
00:27:34,486 --> 00:27:36,655
The boy should be
done reading by now.

396
00:27:36,655 --> 00:27:38,740
I'll have Henry get
snacks for the kids.

397
00:27:42,411 --> 00:27:44,162
Change clothes.

398
00:27:58,510 --> 00:28:00,429
House rules.

399
00:28:00,429 --> 00:28:03,599
One, don't talk
to the kids.

400
00:28:03,599 --> 00:28:07,769
Two, don't take anything
that's not yours.

401
00:28:09,813 --> 00:28:13,692
Three, do what we say
and you'll be fine.

402
00:28:15,527 --> 00:28:19,197
Four, don't forget we know
everyone in this town

403
00:28:19,197 --> 00:28:21,450
and everyone trusts us,

404
00:28:21,450 --> 00:28:24,453
so it's your word
against ours.

405
00:28:24,453 --> 00:28:28,457
Five, the more
uncomfortable you are,

406
00:28:28,457 --> 00:28:29,958
the more you'll grow.

407
00:28:32,085 --> 00:28:33,712
Heavenly Father never
gives us burdens

408
00:28:33,712 --> 00:28:35,672
that are too great to bear.

409
00:28:35,672 --> 00:28:37,883
Remember that
on the hard days.

410
00:28:44,598 --> 00:28:47,476
Questions?

411
00:28:47,476 --> 00:28:49,311
When can I talk
to my parents?

412
00:28:49,311 --> 00:28:52,064
Once a week,
if you act right.

413
00:28:52,064 --> 00:28:55,108
And when can I see
my grandparents?

414
00:28:55,108 --> 00:28:56,777
Not for a while.

415
00:28:56,777 --> 00:28:58,779
Once you prove we can trust you,

416
00:28:58,779 --> 00:29:00,322
we might take you
to church with us,

417
00:29:00,322 --> 00:29:02,616
but even then we don't
want them talking to you.

418
00:29:02,616 --> 00:29:05,827
Change is hard,
you need to focus.

419
00:29:09,081 --> 00:29:12,459
Three months,
or until you're 18.

420
00:29:12,459 --> 00:29:14,419
It's all up to you.

421
00:29:26,723 --> 00:29:29,017
Boys homework, girls play.

422
00:29:31,019 --> 00:29:32,354
I have a joke.

423
00:29:32,354 --> 00:29:34,022
Don't listen to him.

424
00:29:36,942 --> 00:29:39,319
Everyone, everyone settle.

425
00:29:39,319 --> 00:29:41,446
This is Alex.

426
00:29:41,446 --> 00:29:44,241
Alex, that's Damon and Henry,
we're helping them, too.

427
00:29:44,241 --> 00:29:46,535
And these are our kids.

428
00:29:46,535 --> 00:29:48,620
Can I get you
anything to eat?

429
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:50,747
No, I'm fine, thank you.

430
00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:55,961
Get back, play.

431
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:30,662
Can I go back to the room?

432
00:30:58,565 --> 00:31:01,026
Goodnight,
I love you Emma.

433
00:32:45,589 --> 00:32:48,341
Johnny, it's time to go!

434
00:32:50,844 --> 00:32:52,721
We have an appointment
at the alternative high school.

435
00:32:52,721 --> 00:32:55,932
You'll do lessons here with us
while you rehabilitate.

436
00:32:58,768 --> 00:33:00,520
Kept me up all night,

437
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:02,606
I'd only just gone
to sleep when you came in.

438
00:33:02,606 --> 00:33:04,274
Maybe it's time
to try the chiropractor

439
00:33:04,274 --> 00:33:05,442
Sister Franklin
recommended.

440
00:33:05,442 --> 00:33:06,985
The consultation's free.

441
00:33:06,985 --> 00:33:08,695
Consultation's
free and then what?

442
00:33:08,695 --> 00:33:10,864
I've gotta get my
prescription, babe.

443
00:33:10,864 --> 00:33:13,200
I know, I'll figure it out.

444
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:15,452
How far did you say you were
from my grandparents again?

445
00:33:15,452 --> 00:33:16,578
We didn't.

446
00:33:16,578 --> 00:33:17,829
I work in youth
treatment, sweetie.

447
00:33:17,829 --> 00:33:19,664
I've met 10 year old's
sneakier than you.

448
00:33:19,664 --> 00:33:22,417
We're open eight to four,
Monday to Friday.

449
00:33:22,417 --> 00:33:25,462
Make sure you bring the records
from his previous school

450
00:33:25,462 --> 00:33:27,172
and any paperwork
from the judge.

451
00:33:31,468 --> 00:33:33,678
You're so very welcome.

452
00:33:36,431 --> 00:33:39,643
Good to see you Tiana,
and you must be Alex.

453
00:33:39,643 --> 00:33:41,478
From California,
is that right?

454
00:33:41,478 --> 00:33:42,812
Yeah.

455
00:33:42,812 --> 00:33:45,023
She's all mine for now.

456
00:33:47,108 --> 00:33:49,194
Let me just
enter this in the system,

457
00:33:49,194 --> 00:33:51,404
we'll get her packets
and you can be on your way.

458
00:33:53,490 --> 00:33:54,616
What do you want?

459
00:33:54,616 --> 00:33:56,660
Are you eating yet?

460
00:33:56,660 --> 00:33:59,079
I'm not hungry.

461
00:33:59,079 --> 00:34:02,707
But I do need to
go to the bathroom.

462
00:34:02,707 --> 00:34:04,876
Make it fast.

463
00:34:14,469 --> 00:34:16,721
I need help, please.

464
00:34:16,721 --> 00:34:18,515
No habla Ingles.

465
00:34:18,515 --> 00:34:20,684
Phone, por favor?

466
00:34:20,684 --> 00:34:22,435
Phone, phone.

467
00:34:32,696 --> 00:34:33,738
<i>Hello?</i>

468
00:34:33,738 --> 00:34:35,073
Frankie, it's me!

469
00:34:35,073 --> 00:34:36,533
<i>Alex, where are you?</i>

470
00:34:36,533 --> 00:34:37,784
My parents sent me to this
place in Utah with these people

471
00:34:37,784 --> 00:34:39,411
I don't even know.

472
00:34:39,411 --> 00:34:40,829
They're making me live with them
and they took away everything.

473
00:34:40,829 --> 00:34:42,747
- My clothes, my phone...
- Alex!

474
00:34:42,747 --> 00:34:44,541
No please,
I want to come home!

475
00:34:44,541 --> 00:34:46,334
We said no phone.

476
00:34:49,045 --> 00:34:51,339
Someone help.
Please help me!

477
00:34:51,339 --> 00:34:53,883
These people aren't my parents,
I don't even know them.

478
00:34:56,761 --> 00:35:00,140
Please,
no you have to help me!

479
00:35:00,140 --> 00:35:02,225
Help, no!
Someone!

480
00:35:02,225 --> 00:35:04,311
Please help!

481
00:35:05,562 --> 00:35:07,147
Get in the car!

482
00:35:14,321 --> 00:35:15,947
You think
you're smarter than us?

483
00:35:15,947 --> 00:35:17,574
You think we haven't dealt
with kids like you before?

484
00:35:17,574 --> 00:35:19,284
You're wrong.

485
00:35:33,381 --> 00:35:34,799
Stand up.

486
00:35:45,018 --> 00:35:47,604
This is what happens when
you try things like that.

487
00:35:47,604 --> 00:35:49,272
We warned you.

488
00:35:53,610 --> 00:35:55,278
Before we get started,

489
00:35:55,278 --> 00:35:57,906
we have a new member
of the household.

490
00:35:57,906 --> 00:36:00,659
Does anyone know
why Alex is here?

491
00:36:01,576 --> 00:36:03,161
Because she was bad?

492
00:36:04,829 --> 00:36:06,748
Was she arrested?

493
00:36:06,748 --> 00:36:08,958
Did she steal something?

494
00:36:08,958 --> 00:36:11,670
No, but those are
all very good guesses.

495
00:36:11,670 --> 00:36:15,924
She's here because she
made some bad choices

496
00:36:15,924 --> 00:36:17,967
and she got confused

497
00:36:17,967 --> 00:36:21,137
and now she
thinks she's gay.

498
00:36:22,806 --> 00:36:26,476
It's a choice
that some people make,

499
00:36:26,476 --> 00:36:29,771
but that's not how
Heavenly Father created us.

500
00:36:29,771 --> 00:36:32,857
Now, I know you were
taught the plan of salvation,

501
00:36:32,857 --> 00:36:35,402
but do you really
understand it?

502
00:36:37,529 --> 00:36:39,072
I do.

503
00:36:39,072 --> 00:36:41,324
Then you understand how
choosing that lifestyle

504
00:36:41,324 --> 00:36:43,243
makes it impossible
for Heavenly Father

505
00:36:43,243 --> 00:36:45,245
to let you into
the Celestial Kingdom.

506
00:36:45,245 --> 00:36:48,456
Frankly, I don't see how
he can love you like that

507
00:36:48,456 --> 00:36:50,625
but he is forgiving.

508
00:36:50,625 --> 00:36:52,168
He doesn't want you
to be all alone,

509
00:36:52,168 --> 00:36:54,379
away from your family forever.

510
00:36:56,631 --> 00:37:00,009
Damon, name a time
when you felt like

511
00:37:00,009 --> 00:37:02,637
you had to wait
forever for something.

512
00:37:02,637 --> 00:37:03,888
My court date.

513
00:37:03,888 --> 00:37:06,057
Waiting to hear if
I get probation or jail.

514
00:37:06,057 --> 00:37:07,642
Henry?

515
00:37:07,642 --> 00:37:09,144
Senior year of high school,

516
00:37:09,144 --> 00:37:12,647
I just wanted to
get out of there.

517
00:37:12,647 --> 00:37:14,399
Alex?

518
00:37:16,901 --> 00:37:18,528
The drive here.

519
00:37:18,528 --> 00:37:21,823
A few weeks,
a few months,

520
00:37:21,823 --> 00:37:25,285
a few hours.

521
00:37:25,285 --> 00:37:29,706
What if you were
still waiting, right now?

522
00:37:29,706 --> 00:37:32,792
Feeling that pit
in your stomach,

523
00:37:32,792 --> 00:37:34,919
all those nerves.

524
00:37:34,919 --> 00:37:36,713
Imagine you had to feel
that until everyone

525
00:37:36,713 --> 00:37:38,715
in this room was dead.

526
00:37:38,715 --> 00:37:41,134
Until everyone
on Earth was dead.

527
00:37:41,134 --> 00:37:44,554
Until the sun was dead,
the planet itself.

528
00:37:44,554 --> 00:37:47,098
Imagine,
all that time.

529
00:37:47,098 --> 00:37:52,103
And that is nothing
compared to eternity,

530
00:37:52,103 --> 00:37:54,439
nothing.

531
00:37:56,232 --> 00:37:58,735
And that's why
you're here, Alex.

532
00:37:58,735 --> 00:38:01,112
Tiana and I,
we want to help you

533
00:38:01,112 --> 00:38:04,157
so you don't ever
have to suffer like that.

534
00:38:23,510 --> 00:38:27,096
Hi, you'll probably
never read this

535
00:38:27,096 --> 00:38:28,890
but I'll write it anyway,

536
00:38:28,890 --> 00:38:30,725
because why
the hell not?

537
00:38:30,725 --> 00:38:33,770
Look, I'm even
cursing now.

538
00:38:33,770 --> 00:38:36,606
Well, privately anyway.

539
00:38:39,776 --> 00:38:42,695
These people say they'll keep me
until I'm 18 or cured,

540
00:38:42,695 --> 00:38:44,322
whatever
that means.

541
00:38:44,322 --> 00:38:47,325
I think my parents
would actually let them.

542
00:38:49,327 --> 00:38:52,163
I'm mad and sad.

543
00:38:53,790 --> 00:38:55,792
I'm scared.

544
00:38:55,792 --> 00:38:58,169
I never get to
leave the house.

545
00:38:58,169 --> 00:39:02,674
People come over
and I'm invisible.

546
00:39:02,674 --> 00:39:05,802
I talk to Mom once a week,

547
00:39:05,802 --> 00:39:08,096
Dad sometimes.

548
00:39:08,096 --> 00:39:11,558
But they're not
real conversations.

549
00:39:11,558 --> 00:39:15,103
I know my parents think
they're doing the right thing,

550
00:39:15,103 --> 00:39:18,147
but I wish they could
love me the way I am.

551
00:39:18,147 --> 00:39:20,358
Parents must be watchful,

552
00:39:20,358 --> 00:39:21,609
ever vigilant,

553
00:39:21,609 --> 00:39:24,779
to ensure that wickedness
such as homosexuality

554
00:39:24,779 --> 00:39:28,241
does not infect
their family circle.

555
00:39:28,241 --> 00:39:32,078
There are those that say
such unnatural tendencies

556
00:39:32,078 --> 00:39:34,914
are inborn
and cannot be overcome,

557
00:39:34,914 --> 00:39:37,834
not so.

558
00:39:37,834 --> 00:39:41,212
Our Heavenly Father
loves his children.

559
00:39:41,212 --> 00:39:44,424
Why would he
do that to anyone?

560
00:39:44,424 --> 00:39:46,801
<i>The only thing</i>
<i>that keeps me going sometimes</i>

561
00:39:46,801 --> 00:39:48,261
<i>is knowing you're</i>
<i>looking for me</i>

562
00:39:48,261 --> 00:39:50,054
<i>and I might get</i>
<i>to see you again.</i>

563
00:39:50,054 --> 00:39:53,391
<i>But of course,</i>
<i>I also worry.</i>

564
00:39:53,391 --> 00:39:55,351
<i>What if they</i>
<i>find you first?</i>

565
00:40:07,113 --> 00:40:10,450
<i>I hope you're looking</i>
<i>at the moon right now,</i>

566
00:40:10,450 --> 00:40:13,578
<i>I like the idea of us</i>
<i>seeing the same thing.</i>

567
00:40:13,578 --> 00:40:15,872
<i>It makes the world</i>
<i>feel smaller</i>

568
00:40:15,872 --> 00:40:18,875
<i>and this place</i>
<i>not so far way.</i>

569
00:40:18,875 --> 00:40:21,794
<i>Good night.</i>

570
00:40:45,568 --> 00:40:47,278
You're going to
church today.

571
00:40:48,696 --> 00:40:51,699
Every soul
confined in a prison of sin

572
00:40:51,699 --> 00:40:53,534
has a key to that gate

573
00:40:53,534 --> 00:40:55,578
and that key
is called repentance.

574
00:40:55,578 --> 00:40:59,082
What a blessing that is.

575
00:40:59,082 --> 00:41:02,710
The opportunity
to start each day anew

576
00:41:02,710 --> 00:41:04,963
in the name
of Jesus Christ.

577
00:41:04,963 --> 00:41:06,089
Amen.

578
00:41:06,089 --> 00:41:07,966
Amen.

Get six.

596
00:42:07,650 --> 00:42:09,610
What else did she say?

597
00:42:09,610 --> 00:42:11,696
More chicken broth.

598
00:42:13,239 --> 00:42:15,908
Hey, do you see
a smile on my face

599
00:42:15,908 --> 00:42:17,744
like I just won the lottery?

600
00:42:17,744 --> 00:42:21,581
Um, no.

601
00:42:21,581 --> 00:42:24,042
Get the two for ones.

602
00:42:24,042 --> 00:42:25,877
Sorry.

603
00:42:25,877 --> 00:42:29,547
Trust me,
if we were made of money,

604
00:42:29,547 --> 00:42:32,008
we'd be living with
our kids, that's it.

605
00:42:32,008 --> 00:42:35,053
- Chicken broth you said?
Yeah.

606
00:43:02,246 --> 00:43:05,750
Oh, I had a question
about chicken broth.

607
00:43:05,750 --> 00:43:07,460
Last time I was here...

608
00:43:23,726 --> 00:43:25,436
I'm sorry about this.

609
00:43:25,436 --> 00:43:28,564
I've told her it's not funny
to play pranks on people.

610
00:43:35,738 --> 00:43:38,157
Stop, ow stop, please!

611
00:43:41,869 --> 00:43:45,039
I want to pick up on
Bishop Carver's talk

612
00:43:45,039 --> 00:43:47,875
from last Sunday
about prisons of sin.

613
00:43:47,875 --> 00:43:52,255
I want to hear about
the things that got you here.

614
00:43:52,255 --> 00:43:54,674
And we want you to be honest.

615
00:43:57,426 --> 00:43:58,970
Henry?

616
00:43:58,970 --> 00:44:03,057
I was ditching school,
getting bad grades.

617
00:44:03,057 --> 00:44:06,144
I kissed a boy
in my music class

618
00:44:06,144 --> 00:44:08,062
and that was all wrong.

619
00:44:08,062 --> 00:44:10,439
So, thank you for
showing me the way

620
00:44:10,439 --> 00:44:13,151
Heavenly Father
wants me to live.

621
00:44:13,151 --> 00:44:15,778
Damon?

622
00:44:15,778 --> 00:44:18,281
I was hanging out
with the wrong crowd.

623
00:44:18,281 --> 00:44:20,449
Started stealing,
got caught.

624
00:44:20,449 --> 00:44:22,869
I'm grateful the judge offered
that you guys could show me

625
00:44:22,869 --> 00:44:24,871
a better path,
so I don't throw my life away.

626
00:44:24,871 --> 00:44:26,873
Good.

627
00:44:26,873 --> 00:44:28,499
Alex?

628
00:44:30,793 --> 00:44:32,503
I fell in love.

629
00:44:36,048 --> 00:44:38,176
How should we refer
to her anyway?

630
00:44:38,176 --> 00:44:39,802
The dyke?

631
00:44:39,802 --> 00:44:42,638
The lesbo?
The homo?

632
00:44:42,638 --> 00:44:44,724
Her name is Frankie.

633
00:44:46,684 --> 00:44:48,060
Frankie.

634
00:44:48,060 --> 00:44:51,981
What's Frankie's
last name?

635
00:44:51,981 --> 00:44:55,651
She's older
than you, isn't she?

636
00:44:55,651 --> 00:44:59,822
She saw a troubled girl
and she took advantage.

637
00:44:59,822 --> 00:45:01,490
You weren't gay before.

638
00:45:01,490 --> 00:45:03,784
Yes, I was.

639
00:45:03,784 --> 00:45:08,456
You can't change if you
keep protecting her, Alex.

640
00:45:08,456 --> 00:45:10,791
Like we've said,

641
00:45:10,791 --> 00:45:12,919
you can stick with
the problems that got you here,

642
00:45:12,919 --> 00:45:15,504
or you can choose
obedience and happiness.

643
00:45:15,504 --> 00:45:16,797
It's up to you.

644
00:45:16,797 --> 00:45:19,592
If it were up to me,
I wouldn't be here at all.

645
00:45:30,853 --> 00:45:32,688
No one talks,
no one moves.

646
00:45:43,908 --> 00:45:45,618
Where are you gonna go?

647
00:46:02,635 --> 00:46:05,888
Your continued defiance
is a problem, Alex.

648
00:46:05,888 --> 00:46:08,266
You're so determined
to hold onto

649
00:46:08,266 --> 00:46:10,893
this false belief
about yourself,

650
00:46:10,893 --> 00:46:13,145
that you're ignoring
who you truly are.

651
00:46:16,607 --> 00:46:18,067
Since you can't feel
the spiritual burden

652
00:46:18,067 --> 00:46:19,902
of homosexuality,

653
00:46:19,902 --> 00:46:22,989
we're giving you

654
00:46:22,989 --> 00:46:27,285
something physical
to serve as a reminder.

655
00:46:36,002 --> 00:46:38,129
You'll wear this from
morning through evening

656
00:46:38,129 --> 00:46:39,797
until you get it.

657
00:46:47,305 --> 00:46:48,764
Now.

658
00:47:57,375 --> 00:48:00,086
Are you ready to give us
Frankie's last name?

659
00:48:06,008 --> 00:48:09,762
Henry, go get
another rock.

660
00:48:09,762 --> 00:48:12,390
Make it a good sized one,
or you'll wear a backpack, too.

661
00:48:27,363 --> 00:48:29,532
I'd have taken
the jail time.

662
00:48:35,704 --> 00:48:37,540
If you want to
screw yourself, fine,

663
00:48:37,540 --> 00:48:39,625
but do not
mess this up for me.

664
00:48:44,672 --> 00:48:45,881
Johnny.

665
00:48:52,847 --> 00:48:54,432
It's okay.

666
00:49:02,481 --> 00:49:04,483
Don't talk to anyone,
not even me.

667
00:49:04,483 --> 00:49:06,235
I have a job here to do today,
you're just here to observe

668
00:49:06,235 --> 00:49:08,070
and see how good
you've got it.

669
00:49:08,070 --> 00:49:10,072
What are they here for?

670
00:49:10,072 --> 00:49:13,159
Drinking, drugs,
arrested for this or that,

671
00:49:13,159 --> 00:49:15,453
all headed down
the wrong path in some way.

672
00:49:17,746 --> 00:49:21,500
Being a parent, you'll do
anything, give anything.

673
00:49:21,500 --> 00:49:24,336
But a place like this
costs an arm and two legs

674
00:49:24,336 --> 00:49:26,422
and some families
just don't have it.

675
00:49:26,422 --> 00:49:28,841
That's why we do what we do,
me and Johnny.

676
00:49:28,841 --> 00:49:32,303
If you don't make this work,
this is your next stop.

677
00:49:34,054 --> 00:49:36,515
And you will come here knowing
that it cost your parents

678
00:49:36,515 --> 00:49:39,351
every penny they worked
their whole lives for.

679
00:49:55,242 --> 00:49:57,870
I know it's a lot at first,
but it really does help.

680
00:50:02,374 --> 00:50:04,084
This is what your parents want.

681
00:50:04,084 --> 00:50:06,128
We told them we're not sure
if you're ready for a visit,

682
00:50:06,128 --> 00:50:09,048
but since
it's Thanksgiving.

683
00:50:11,133 --> 00:50:13,135
Just remember,
seeing them is a privilege

684
00:50:13,135 --> 00:50:15,513
that can be taken away.

685
00:50:17,806 --> 00:50:19,683
Come in Alex, come in.

686
00:50:22,269 --> 00:50:26,690
So, we have good news.

687
00:50:30,110 --> 00:50:34,073
We're working on moving here
to Utah to be closer to you.

688
00:50:36,825 --> 00:50:38,077
What?

689
00:50:39,662 --> 00:50:41,330
No.

690
00:50:41,330 --> 00:50:43,165
No, you have to
take me home.

691
00:50:43,165 --> 00:50:45,084
Honey,
we've talked about this.

692
00:50:45,084 --> 00:50:47,086
I can't stay here with them.

693
00:50:47,086 --> 00:50:50,172
Come on, don't make this
harder for your mother

694
00:50:50,172 --> 00:50:52,508
than this already is.

695
00:50:52,508 --> 00:50:56,804
They can't change
how I feel, Dad.

696
00:50:56,804 --> 00:51:00,849
I know you think that God
wants me to be different.

697
00:51:00,849 --> 00:51:02,726
You think?

698
00:51:02,726 --> 00:51:06,397
Please, I don't even know
where I am on a map.

699
00:51:27,418 --> 00:51:29,753
They hit me, Mom.

700
00:51:29,753 --> 00:51:34,216
They make me wear
a backpack full of rocks.

701
00:51:34,216 --> 00:51:36,051
You have to believe me.

702
00:51:40,472 --> 00:51:41,724
Like we believed you
when you said

703
00:51:41,724 --> 00:51:44,643
you were spending
the night at Daniella's?

704
00:51:53,235 --> 00:51:55,154
Look at this.

705
00:51:59,867 --> 00:52:01,410
Mom.

706
00:52:03,162 --> 00:52:05,706
We're trying so hard.

707
00:52:05,706 --> 00:52:07,958
So hard to do
the right thing here.

708
00:52:09,293 --> 00:52:11,128
Look.

709
00:52:12,463 --> 00:52:15,883
We're not spending
eternity without you.

710
00:52:15,883 --> 00:52:18,010
Dammit, look at me!

711
00:52:18,010 --> 00:52:20,179
Please.

712
00:52:21,930 --> 00:52:24,642
I love you so much Alex.

713
00:52:49,291 --> 00:52:50,876
Alex.

714
00:52:52,503 --> 00:52:54,421
Your parents told us that
you tried to convince them

715
00:52:54,421 --> 00:52:56,465
to take you home
last night,

716
00:52:56,465 --> 00:53:00,260
and you also asked them
to not tell us you did that.

717
00:53:00,260 --> 00:53:02,554
They want you home with them,

718
00:53:02,554 --> 00:53:05,140
but everything that's happening
right now is your choice.

719
00:53:05,140 --> 00:53:09,144
You're the one running from
the girl God created you to be.

720
00:53:10,604 --> 00:53:13,482
Today you stop running.

721
00:53:16,902 --> 00:53:18,904
Give us Frankie's
last name and address,

722
00:53:21,115 --> 00:53:22,241
right now.

723
00:53:25,536 --> 00:53:27,371
I have nothing
to say about her.

724
00:53:27,371 --> 00:53:28,831
Jonathan.

725
00:53:37,339 --> 00:53:40,884
Jesus was tempted,
we all are.

726
00:53:40,884 --> 00:53:44,888
But until you're willing
to do what's right,

727
00:53:44,888 --> 00:53:48,559
not only will you wear
that backpack all day,

728
00:53:48,559 --> 00:53:51,228
you will wear it
facing the wall

729
00:53:51,228 --> 00:53:54,231
from breakfast to bedtime.

730
00:53:58,902 --> 00:54:00,195
Starting now.

731
00:54:07,953 --> 00:54:09,288
Here.

732
00:54:14,209 --> 00:54:15,794
No more running.

733
00:55:11,099 --> 00:55:12,893
One,

734
00:55:12,893 --> 00:55:14,436
two,

735
00:55:14,436 --> 00:55:16,813
three,

736
00:55:16,813 --> 00:55:18,440
four,

737
00:55:18,440 --> 00:55:20,067
five,

738
00:55:20,067 --> 00:55:21,818
six,

739
00:55:21,818 --> 00:55:23,320
seven.

740
00:56:01,650 --> 00:56:03,652
Time to go to bed, Alex.

741
00:57:06,632 --> 00:57:08,967
Dear Heavenly Father,

742
00:57:08,967 --> 00:57:12,304
please help me find
a way out of here.

743
00:57:14,598 --> 00:57:17,768
1,972...

744
00:57:20,604 --> 00:57:22,397
Please help me.

745
00:57:30,572 --> 00:57:32,157
Help me.

746
00:57:42,584 --> 00:57:44,795
Help me.

747
00:57:46,046 --> 00:57:48,256
Please.

748
00:57:49,591 --> 00:57:52,678
Elder Sanders,
Thompson, come in.

749
00:57:52,678 --> 00:57:54,680
I hope you like pasta.

750
00:57:54,680 --> 00:57:56,598
We love anything we don't
have to cook ourselves,

751
00:57:56,598 --> 00:57:57,808
thank you for having us.

752
00:57:57,808 --> 00:57:59,518
Thanks so much,
Brother Simms.

753
00:58:05,607 --> 00:58:06,942
Hey, Elder.

754
00:58:13,281 --> 00:58:15,701
At this rate,
I'll never get back to work.

755
00:58:15,701 --> 00:58:17,828
We'll see what the PT
has to say on Monday.

756
00:58:17,828 --> 00:58:19,538
He's useless, T!

757
00:58:22,582 --> 00:58:23,709
Bend this,
stretch that,

758
00:58:23,709 --> 00:58:25,502
how is any of that
supposed to help?

759
00:58:26,962 --> 00:58:29,131
Kids, go play
in your room.

760
00:58:29,131 --> 00:58:31,007
Damon, Henry,
shovel the walk.

761
00:58:38,348 --> 00:58:40,183
Alex, go check the pantry,

762
00:58:40,183 --> 00:58:41,893
see how much ramen
we have left.

763
00:58:43,145 --> 00:58:44,646
We could kick you out, you know.

764
00:58:44,646 --> 00:58:46,565
Then what would you do?

765
00:59:10,464 --> 00:59:12,883
<i>Dear Mom and Dad.</i>

766
00:59:12,883 --> 00:59:16,052
<i>I want you to know</i>
<i>how much I love you.</i>

767
00:59:17,679 --> 00:59:19,347
<i>I know you love me, too.</i>

768
00:59:20,724 --> 00:59:22,350
<i>I know you do.</i>

769
00:59:24,644 --> 00:59:27,647
<i>I wish I could be who</i>
<i>you want me to be,</i>

770
00:59:27,647 --> 00:59:30,942
<i>or that I was good enough</i>
<i>just the way I am.</i>

771
00:59:33,653 --> 00:59:36,156
<i>I know you thought</i>
<i>this would help,</i>

772
00:59:36,156 --> 00:59:40,035
<i>but I can't do it anymore.</i>

773
00:59:41,661 --> 00:59:44,206
<i>Fight them,</i>
<i>fight you,</i>

774
00:59:44,206 --> 00:59:47,542
<i>fight something in me</i>
<i>that can't be fixed.</i>

775
00:59:50,670 --> 00:59:53,882
<i>Thanks for calling earlier</i>
<i>to wish me happy birthday.</i>

776
00:59:55,300 --> 00:59:57,928
<i>16, so weird.</i>

777
01:00:00,639 --> 01:00:03,266
<i>I wish I'd gotten to hear</i>
<i>your voices one last time.</i>

778
01:00:05,727 --> 01:00:07,103
<i>I love you.</i>

779
01:00:08,688 --> 01:00:10,065
<i>I'm really sorry.</i>

780
01:01:13,086 --> 01:01:14,921
Get up.

781
01:01:14,921 --> 01:01:16,506
Wake up, come on Alex.

782
01:01:16,506 --> 01:01:17,674
Wake up, get up!

783
01:01:23,763 --> 01:01:25,682
How could you
do that in our home?

784
01:01:25,682 --> 01:01:27,684
In our daughter's bedroom?

785
01:01:31,730 --> 01:01:32,981
Dry off, get breakfast

786
01:01:32,981 --> 01:01:34,524
and don't think
this changes anything.

787
01:01:34,524 --> 01:01:36,026
This, what you did today
is just another way

788
01:01:36,026 --> 01:01:38,194
of running
and we won't have it.

789
01:01:53,668 --> 01:01:55,253
Sister Simms, good to see you.

790
01:01:55,253 --> 01:01:57,088
- You too, Bishop.
- Alex, come on in.

791
01:02:03,970 --> 01:02:05,764
So, how are you?

792
01:02:12,604 --> 01:02:14,773
I want to go home.

793
01:02:14,773 --> 01:02:19,027
I miss my friends,
my school,

794
01:02:21,488 --> 01:02:23,448
the way it used to be
with my parents.

795
01:02:23,448 --> 01:02:26,701
Have you spoken to them
since your overdose?

796
01:02:26,701 --> 01:02:30,747
It wasn't an overdose.

797
01:02:30,747 --> 01:02:33,917
I tried to kill myself.

798
01:02:38,004 --> 01:02:39,422
Have you spoken to them?

799
01:02:42,842 --> 01:02:45,303
They came to visit me
at Christmas.

800
01:02:45,303 --> 01:02:49,766
I was hoping they were
going to take me home.

801
01:02:49,766 --> 01:02:54,562
But, they're so worried

802
01:02:54,562 --> 01:02:56,439
about the next life

803
01:02:56,439 --> 01:03:00,610
they can't see what's
happening to me in this one.

804
01:03:03,571 --> 01:03:07,117
Please, Bishop,
you have to help me.

805
01:03:07,117 --> 01:03:10,036
No one else is.

806
01:03:10,036 --> 01:03:14,582
Your parents I know
are good people.

807
01:03:14,582 --> 01:03:17,502
They want what's best
for you, we all do.

808
01:03:17,502 --> 01:03:20,255
I wear a backpack full of rocks.

809
01:03:20,255 --> 01:03:24,926
Johnny and Tianna make me
stand at a wall all day.

810
01:03:24,926 --> 01:03:26,553
I've known them
a long time.

811
01:03:26,553 --> 01:03:30,974
My shoulder and back
hurt so much.

812
01:03:30,974 --> 01:03:33,059
People come
to visit the house

813
01:03:33,059 --> 01:03:35,353
and I'm standing
right there.

814
01:03:35,353 --> 01:03:37,856
You used to do drugs,
didn't you?

815
01:03:40,900 --> 01:03:43,611
Just pot
and not in forever,

816
01:03:43,611 --> 01:03:46,072
and it's not about that.

817
01:03:46,072 --> 01:03:47,782
I know.

818
01:03:50,869 --> 01:03:53,329
There's a difference between
feelings and actions, Alex.

819
01:03:53,329 --> 01:03:56,624
You can't always
choose the former,

820
01:03:56,624 --> 01:03:59,377
but you can
choose the latter.

821
01:03:59,377 --> 01:04:01,212
You can choose a path
that takes you closer

822
01:04:01,212 --> 01:04:02,464
to our Heavenly Father

823
01:04:02,464 --> 01:04:04,883
or you can choose one
that tears you from him

824
01:04:04,883 --> 01:04:07,510
and we're all trying to
help you understand that.

825
01:04:30,200 --> 01:04:32,911
I've tried
so hard to protect you,

826
01:04:32,911 --> 01:04:35,455
to protect myself,

827
01:04:35,455 --> 01:04:40,293
but I'm tired,
sad, lonely.

828
01:04:40,293 --> 01:04:43,963
I'm in constant pain,
I can't sleep,

829
01:04:43,963 --> 01:04:46,508
I can't stay awake.

830
01:04:46,508 --> 01:04:50,136
709 more days
until I'm 18

831
01:04:50,136 --> 01:04:54,224
and I just can't
do this anymore.

832
01:04:56,893 --> 01:04:58,394
I'm so sorry.

833
01:04:58,394 --> 01:05:00,563
I just need this to stop.

834
01:05:09,906 --> 01:05:11,658
I made you some breakfast.

835
01:05:11,658 --> 01:05:12,951
Thank you.

836
01:05:12,951 --> 01:05:14,744
I'll get it, you sit.

837
01:05:18,039 --> 01:05:19,749
Everyone's still asleep?

838
01:05:19,749 --> 01:05:21,376
Yep.

839
01:05:24,420 --> 01:05:26,756
Tianna.

840
01:05:34,013 --> 01:05:35,765
I'm ready to quit.

841
01:05:39,394 --> 01:05:41,771
Take your backpack off,
come sit.

842
01:05:52,824 --> 01:05:56,119
You understand,
we just want you to be honest.

843
01:05:58,204 --> 01:06:00,623
We want you
to focus on getting better,

844
01:06:00,623 --> 01:06:02,584
on living the values
we teach in our home

845
01:06:02,584 --> 01:06:04,294
and your parents
teach in theirs.

846
01:06:08,214 --> 01:06:10,008
Her last name is Jackson.

847
01:07:05,605 --> 01:07:09,275
<i>For 52 days,</i>
<i>I followed every single rule.</i>

848
01:07:09,275 --> 01:07:11,236
<i>Whenever they asked,</i>

849
01:07:11,236 --> 01:07:15,031
<i>I told them</i>
<i>I was straight, cured.</i>

850
01:07:16,866 --> 01:07:20,995
52 days,
and then I finally got out.

851
01:07:22,163 --> 01:07:24,332
It was just to a museum,

852
01:07:24,332 --> 01:07:26,292
but it was
a whole afternoon.

853
01:07:26,292 --> 01:07:29,379
That was 25 days ago.

854
01:07:29,379 --> 01:07:32,131
77 days since I've
had to wear a backpack

855
01:07:32,131 --> 01:07:34,717
or stand at a wall.

856
01:07:34,717 --> 01:07:38,388
They're letting me
go back to school now.

857
01:07:38,388 --> 01:07:42,100
They trust I'd do anything
to stay away from that wall,

858
01:07:42,100 --> 01:07:44,560
and they're right.

859
01:07:47,188 --> 01:07:48,856
I'm so sorry
I let you down,

860
01:07:48,856 --> 01:07:52,568
I still think about you
all the time.

861
01:07:54,779 --> 01:07:58,116
I hope you're safe and that
you can forgive me someday.

862
01:08:04,163 --> 01:08:06,708
Tell people you moved
here to help your grandparents.

863
01:08:09,127 --> 01:08:10,753
And remember,
we know all the teachers

864
01:08:10,753 --> 01:08:12,755
and everyone who
works in the office.

865
01:08:12,755 --> 01:08:14,132
Alright, class.

866
01:08:14,132 --> 01:08:16,092
Grab our mixing bowls
and muffin tins, Rhys, Molly

867
01:08:16,092 --> 01:08:18,011
if you could preheat
the ovens please.

868
01:08:19,429 --> 01:08:21,931
Jason Miles Macy, 17,
obsessed with Sleigh Bells

869
01:08:21,931 --> 01:08:23,766
and St Vincent,
I once jumped out

870
01:08:23,766 --> 01:08:25,268
of a perfectly good airplane

871
01:08:25,268 --> 01:08:29,188
and I bake extraordinary
honey oatmeal muffins.

872
01:08:29,188 --> 01:08:31,274
You?

873
01:08:31,274 --> 01:08:32,650
I'm Alex.

874
01:08:32,650 --> 01:08:37,447
Okay Chatty Cathy,
let's start with the basics.

875
01:08:37,447 --> 01:08:38,781
How old are you?

876
01:08:38,781 --> 01:08:40,450
16.

877
01:08:40,450 --> 01:08:41,868
Where are you from?

878
01:08:41,868 --> 01:08:45,121
California, but I moved here
to help my grandparents.

879
01:08:45,121 --> 01:08:47,874
In the middle of the school
year? That sucks.

880
01:08:47,874 --> 01:08:50,835
At least I get to
go to school.

881
01:08:50,835 --> 01:08:52,837
If you say so.

882
01:08:52,837 --> 01:08:53,838
Favourite band?

883
01:08:53,838 --> 01:08:56,841
I like 80s stuff,

884
01:08:56,841 --> 01:08:58,801
but new stuff is cool too.

885
01:08:58,801 --> 01:09:01,888
Sleigh Bells,
Tegan and Sara.

886
01:09:06,476 --> 01:09:08,811
You're sitting with me
at lunch, by the way.

887
01:09:08,811 --> 01:09:13,483
It's okay, I'm actually
kind of allergic to sunlight.

888
01:09:13,483 --> 01:09:15,443
I guess we're
sitting inside then.

889
01:09:17,111 --> 01:09:19,614
This is Carol Lynn's room,
you'll love her.

890
01:09:23,034 --> 01:09:24,994
Cookie cutter relief
society president,

891
01:09:24,994 --> 01:09:26,829
she is not.

892
01:09:30,833 --> 01:09:32,543
Carol Lynn's Mormon?

893
01:09:32,543 --> 01:09:33,753
Uh, yeah.

894
01:09:36,881 --> 01:09:38,674
Carol Lynn, Alex.

895
01:09:38,674 --> 01:09:41,719
Alex, Carol Lynn Nielson,
English teacher extraordinaire

896
01:09:41,719 --> 01:09:43,346
and maintainer
of my sanity

897
01:09:43,346 --> 01:09:45,223
amidst the madness
of this world.

898
01:09:45,223 --> 01:09:46,891
Lovely to meet you, Alex.

899
01:09:46,891 --> 01:09:48,267
You too,
Mrs. Nielsen.

900
01:09:48,267 --> 01:09:50,311
Please call me Carol Lynn
or you'll make me feel old.

901
01:09:50,311 --> 01:09:51,896
Did you just move here?

902
01:09:51,896 --> 01:09:53,856
From California.

903
01:09:53,856 --> 01:09:55,233
I'm here to help
my grandparents.

904
01:09:55,233 --> 01:09:57,360
I'm sure they
appreciate that.

905
01:09:57,360 --> 01:09:59,904
So, what did you do at your
school back home, any clubs?

906
01:09:59,904 --> 01:10:01,531
Carol Lynn coaches
the debate club,

907
01:10:01,531 --> 01:10:04,117
the environmental club
and the gay straight alliance.

908
01:10:04,117 --> 01:10:06,577
Alex did a recycling drive
before coming out here,

909
01:10:06,577 --> 01:10:08,579
maybe she should join
the environmental club?

910
01:10:13,876 --> 01:10:16,504
I forgot my lunch in my locker,
nice to meet you.

911
01:10:20,591 --> 01:10:22,468
I spoke to Mr. Ballard
this afternoon,

912
01:10:22,468 --> 01:10:24,721
he said you were a nice
addition to his math class.

913
01:10:25,930 --> 01:10:27,807
Good, I'm glad
to hear that.

914
01:10:30,059 --> 01:10:31,894
And Jennine said
you passed by the office

915
01:10:31,894 --> 01:10:33,896
before fifth period,

916
01:10:33,896 --> 01:10:35,732
got lost on your way
to biology, huh?

917
01:10:35,732 --> 01:10:39,152
Yeah, I got turned
around in the quad.

918
01:10:39,152 --> 01:10:41,904
I made it before
the bell, though.

919
01:10:41,904 --> 01:10:44,115
I know.

920
01:10:46,659 --> 01:10:48,703
What did you do at lunch?

921
01:10:50,455 --> 01:10:53,791
I met the teacher who chairs
the school environmental club.

922
01:10:53,791 --> 01:10:57,712
My parents probably told you
I did a recycling drive

923
01:10:57,712 --> 01:10:59,255
at my school back home.

924
01:10:59,255 --> 01:11:02,133
I was thinking of maybe
doing one here, too.

925
01:11:05,928 --> 01:11:07,972
That sounds
like a nice idea.

926
01:11:07,972 --> 01:11:09,932
Boys!

927
01:11:09,932 --> 01:11:11,851
Hands to yourselves.

928
01:11:16,105 --> 01:11:18,983
I think your feet are melting.

929
01:11:18,983 --> 01:11:20,359
Oh my God!

930
01:11:20,359 --> 01:11:22,361
They are melting
and so are yours!

931
01:11:22,361 --> 01:11:24,822
What? No!

932
01:11:31,621 --> 01:11:33,247
How can you be gay?

933
01:11:34,999 --> 01:11:37,960
I mean, out.

934
01:11:37,960 --> 01:11:40,713
Here of all places.

935
01:11:45,343 --> 01:11:47,804
Well, it wasn't exactly
a stroll down the runway.

936
01:11:47,804 --> 01:11:50,681
I spend more time getting
stuffed into my locker

937
01:11:50,681 --> 01:11:52,809
or having trash
dumped on my head

938
01:11:52,809 --> 01:11:54,268
than sitting in class.

939
01:11:54,268 --> 01:11:57,563
Most of the teachers don't do
anything about it, obviously.

940
01:11:57,563 --> 01:12:01,025
One, who shall
remain nameless

941
01:12:01,025 --> 01:12:05,029
was literally
five feet away

942
01:12:05,029 --> 01:12:07,031
when this meathead
gut punched me

943
01:12:07,031 --> 01:12:09,325
and he just kept walking
into the teacher's lounge

944
01:12:09,325 --> 01:12:11,118
like nothing happened.

945
01:12:13,037 --> 01:12:14,705
I'm so sorry.

946
01:12:14,705 --> 01:12:17,083
Yeah, I was like...

947
01:12:18,543 --> 01:12:20,711
This close to done,
you know.

948
01:12:24,340 --> 01:12:26,425
Why didn't you?

949
01:12:28,511 --> 01:12:30,221
I couldn't do
that to my mom.

950
01:12:32,181 --> 01:12:35,017
Not without telling
her why at least.

951
01:12:39,188 --> 01:12:42,066
We were in the mall,
I don't even really remember

952
01:12:42,066 --> 01:12:43,401
what we were shopping for

953
01:12:43,401 --> 01:12:46,654
and I wrote her this note.

954
01:12:49,532 --> 01:12:51,242
I'm gay.

955
01:12:53,828 --> 01:12:57,039
I was like totally shaking,
mentally preparing myself

956
01:12:57,039 --> 01:12:59,500
for how I'd do it if she...

957
01:13:04,755 --> 01:13:08,092
But she just hugged me
and told me that

958
01:13:08,092 --> 01:13:11,554
she loved me
no matter what.

959
01:13:15,057 --> 01:13:18,060
Anyhow,

960
01:13:18,060 --> 01:13:20,646
it made
everything easier.

961
01:13:21,856 --> 01:13:23,774
So did finding Carol Lynn.

962
01:13:23,774 --> 01:13:26,110
Having a place to go.

963
01:13:26,110 --> 01:13:28,195
Sounds amazing.

964
01:13:33,409 --> 01:13:36,078
You think you know anything?

965
01:13:36,078 --> 01:13:38,456
Let his be a lesson
to you, Henry!

966
01:13:38,456 --> 01:13:40,666
You wanna go to jail, Damon?
Is that it?

967
01:13:40,666 --> 01:13:42,835
One call to your
parole officer.

968
01:13:42,835 --> 01:13:45,463
One phone call and I
will make it happen.

969
01:13:48,799 --> 01:13:50,509
Alex, will you
pass me the butter?

970
01:13:55,097 --> 01:13:57,183
Thanks.

971
01:14:13,449 --> 01:14:15,201
I have a girlfriend.

972
01:14:15,201 --> 01:14:16,535
I'm not helping
my grandparents.

973
01:14:16,535 --> 01:14:17,745
My parents sent me
to live with these people

974
01:14:17,745 --> 01:14:20,122
who are trying to
cure me form being gay.

975
01:14:22,166 --> 01:14:25,086
, Dammit.

976
01:14:25,086 --> 01:14:28,005
I shouldn't have said
or dammit or any of that.

977
01:14:28,005 --> 01:14:29,131
I'm sorry.

978
01:14:29,131 --> 01:14:31,676
It's okay Alex,
everything's okay.

979
01:14:31,676 --> 01:14:33,886
No, please.
Do not tell anyone.

980
01:14:33,886 --> 01:14:36,514
We won't, but you can't go back,
you're not safe there.

981
01:14:36,514 --> 01:14:39,016
I'm fine,
it's not a big deal.

982
01:14:39,016 --> 01:14:41,185
Alex, let me help you.

983
01:14:41,185 --> 01:14:42,687
They know everyone
Carol Lynn.

984
01:14:42,687 --> 01:14:45,231
Cops, teachers,
my teachers,

985
01:14:45,231 --> 01:14:47,817
Jennine in the front office
is in their ward.

986
01:14:47,817 --> 01:14:50,194
You can stay with me,
my mom will totally let you.

987
01:14:50,194 --> 01:14:51,696
My parents gave
them custody.

988
01:14:51,696 --> 01:14:54,240
The cops will just
take me right back.

989
01:14:56,492 --> 01:14:58,035
I should call Paul.

990
01:14:58,035 --> 01:15:00,204
You think that's
a good idea?

991
01:15:00,204 --> 01:15:01,497
Who's Paul?

992
01:15:01,497 --> 01:15:03,666
Paul Berg,
he's an attorney I know

993
01:15:03,666 --> 01:15:05,459
in Salt Lake
who can help.

994
01:15:07,503 --> 01:15:09,839
I can't be late for class,
I'll call him tomorrow okay?

995
01:15:09,839 --> 01:15:10,965
I promise.

996
01:15:10,965 --> 01:15:12,216
You'll be alright tonight?

997
01:15:12,216 --> 01:15:14,468
I've lasted this long.

998
01:15:39,201 --> 01:15:41,537
I made this for you.

999
01:15:41,537 --> 01:15:44,081
It looks like a sun.

1000
01:15:45,458 --> 01:15:47,209
- It's beautiful, Emma.
- Thank you.

1001
01:15:47,209 --> 01:15:49,962
Alex, make a snack for the kids.

1002
01:15:52,882 --> 01:15:56,385
Paul, it's Jason,
I'm here with Alex.

1003
01:15:56,385 --> 01:15:58,763
The girl
I told you about.

1004
01:15:59,722 --> 01:16:01,057
I'll keep this safe.

1005
01:16:01,057 --> 01:16:02,558
Thank you.

1006
01:16:13,027 --> 01:16:14,278
Hello?

1007
01:16:14,278 --> 01:16:17,114
Alex, this is Paul Berg,
how can I help you?

1008
01:16:17,114 --> 01:16:20,242
Um, well...

1009
01:16:20,242 --> 01:16:23,370
I came out to my parents
and they sent me

1010
01:16:23,370 --> 01:16:24,955
to live with these people

1011
01:16:24,955 --> 01:16:27,124
who said they can
make me straight.

1012
01:16:27,124 --> 01:16:30,252
They hit me sometimes.

1013
01:16:30,252 --> 01:16:33,422
I had to wear
a backpack of rocks

1014
01:16:33,422 --> 01:16:35,549
and stand at a wall
all day.

1015
01:16:39,053 --> 01:16:42,264
I tried to kill myself.

1016
01:16:42,264 --> 01:16:44,892
Failed, obviously.

1017
01:16:47,770 --> 01:16:49,855
I also like dark
chocolate,

1018
01:16:49,855 --> 01:16:52,316
cheesy music
and long walks on the beach.

1019
01:16:52,316 --> 01:16:54,860
How about you?

1020
01:16:54,860 --> 01:16:57,321
It sounds like you've
been through the ringer.

1021
01:16:57,321 --> 01:17:01,117
If you want an attorney,
I'd be happy to work with you

1022
01:17:01,117 --> 01:17:03,911
pro bono,
for free.

1023
01:17:03,911 --> 01:17:07,206
I'd like to get
you out of there.

1024
01:17:07,206 --> 01:17:10,960
Would you be able to
help my girlfriend, too?

1025
01:17:10,960 --> 01:17:14,338
I mean,
she's not my, I don't know.

1026
01:17:15,464 --> 01:17:18,551
My parents
want her arrested.

1027
01:17:18,551 --> 01:17:21,011
I'll do everything I can.

1028
01:17:21,011 --> 01:17:23,472
Thank you,

1029
01:17:23,472 --> 01:17:25,182
thank you so much.

1030
01:17:25,182 --> 01:17:28,185
Ideally, I'd like to call a few
other people who can help us,

1031
01:17:28,185 --> 01:17:31,856
but if you're in imminent danger
I will not leave you there.

1032
01:17:31,856 --> 01:17:35,359
I'm okay, I promise.

1033
01:17:35,359 --> 01:17:37,528
If anything changes,
you have Jason call me,

1034
01:17:37,528 --> 01:17:39,029
otherwise
we'll talk tomorrow.

1035
01:17:39,029 --> 01:17:41,198
Sound good?

1036
01:17:41,198 --> 01:17:42,491
Sounds good.

1037
01:17:42,491 --> 01:17:44,410
Okay, bye.

1038
01:17:47,329 --> 01:17:49,206
He's gonna help me.

1039
01:17:52,376 --> 01:17:53,794
Oh no!

1040
01:18:01,552 --> 01:18:03,345
You're late.

1041
01:18:08,851 --> 01:18:10,728
Let your brother play, okay?

1042
01:18:14,398 --> 01:18:17,067
You be good.

1043
01:18:17,067 --> 01:18:20,613
Henry, have a seat.

1044
01:18:26,619 --> 01:18:28,537
Does anyone have anything
they'd like to say?

1045
01:18:32,208 --> 01:18:34,919
You can't keep anything from us,
you all know that, right?

1046
01:18:39,256 --> 01:18:41,091
Alex?

1047
01:18:42,843 --> 01:18:45,429
We got a call
from school today.

1048
01:18:45,429 --> 01:18:47,306
You were late to class.

1049
01:18:50,434 --> 01:18:51,685
What were you
doing at lunch?

1050
01:18:55,814 --> 01:18:58,400
You're an impressive liar,
you know that.

1051
01:18:58,400 --> 01:19:01,779
We actually believed
you were on the right path.

1052
01:19:03,364 --> 01:19:04,990
Since we can't trust you,

1053
01:19:04,990 --> 01:19:07,451
we're pulling you
out of school immediately.

1054
01:19:07,451 --> 01:19:10,412
And you'll go back
to the wall

1055
01:19:10,412 --> 01:19:13,165
with the backpack.

1056
01:19:16,460 --> 01:19:18,128
Now.

1057
01:20:24,820 --> 01:20:26,655
- Morning.
- Hey.

1058
01:20:26,655 --> 01:20:28,198
Would you like me to call
the police, sweetie?

1059
01:20:28,198 --> 01:20:30,159
No, please don't.

1060
01:20:30,159 --> 01:20:33,162
I just need to get to school,
can you please help me?

1061
01:20:33,162 --> 01:20:34,830
Hop on.

1062
01:21:27,216 --> 01:21:28,425
Alex?

1063
01:21:28,425 --> 01:21:30,135
They put me on
the wall again.

1064
01:21:30,135 --> 01:21:31,387
I can't!

1065
01:21:31,387 --> 01:21:33,889
Everything's
going to be okay.

1066
01:21:33,889 --> 01:21:36,225
I'll call the police
and child services.

1067
01:21:36,225 --> 01:21:37,559
No, they know them!

1068
01:21:37,559 --> 01:21:39,228
Everyone knows
what they do.

1069
01:21:39,228 --> 01:21:41,188
I will not let anyone
take you back,

1070
01:21:41,188 --> 01:21:42,231
neither will Paul.

1071
01:21:42,231 --> 01:21:44,024
Please, Alex?

1072
01:21:44,024 --> 01:21:45,317
Trust me.

1073
01:21:49,571 --> 01:21:52,241
This girl is in danger.

1074
01:21:52,241 --> 01:21:54,910
If any of you notify
the Simms that she's here,

1075
01:21:54,910 --> 01:21:56,954
you will go to jail.

1076
01:21:56,954 --> 01:21:58,622
Any questions?

1077
01:21:58,622 --> 01:22:00,457
Jennine?

1078
01:22:28,277 --> 01:22:29,903
Thank you.

1079
01:22:35,951 --> 01:22:37,703
Hey Sandra.

1080
01:22:39,788 --> 01:22:41,498
Thank you for
bringing her in.

1081
01:22:41,498 --> 01:22:44,126
You must be Alex.

1082
01:22:45,294 --> 01:22:47,379
You're in good hands.

1083
01:22:53,302 --> 01:22:55,262
How long were you there?

1084
01:22:58,765 --> 01:23:01,268
You don't have to tell me
any details you don't want to.

1085
01:23:02,936 --> 01:23:05,272
I just want you to know
that whatever happened,

1086
01:23:05,272 --> 01:23:07,983
it's not your fault.

1087
01:23:12,696 --> 01:23:14,656
243 days.

1088
01:23:18,327 --> 01:23:19,912
Eight months.

1089
01:23:45,354 --> 01:23:47,314
What if they come here?

1090
01:23:47,314 --> 01:23:51,193
They won't be allowed on
the premises, you're safe.

1091
01:23:53,487 --> 01:23:57,324
If my parents
want to send me back,

1092
01:23:57,324 --> 01:23:59,159
can they do that?

1093
01:24:00,869 --> 01:24:02,871
You've got a lot
of people helping you,

1094
01:24:02,871 --> 01:24:06,208
including an attorney,
which most kids don't have.

1095
01:24:06,208 --> 01:24:08,794
And I've got the feeling
he's not the quitting type.

1096
01:24:17,010 --> 01:24:19,263
We're not all
like that, you know.

1097
01:24:19,263 --> 01:24:21,056
Mormons, I mean.

1098
01:24:21,056 --> 01:24:23,392
We're not all like the Simms
and those people

1099
01:24:23,392 --> 01:24:26,395
who thought it was okay,
the things they did.

1100
01:24:26,395 --> 01:24:29,565
How they tried
to change you.

1101
01:24:29,565 --> 01:24:31,358
I know.

1102
01:24:37,406 --> 01:24:41,618
For what it's worth,
gay, bi, straight,

1103
01:24:41,618 --> 01:24:43,870
love is love.

1104
01:24:46,582 --> 01:24:51,044
And you're perfect, Alex,
just the way you are.

1105
01:24:53,046 --> 01:24:56,425
That's what I think anyway,
and I'm pretty sure

1106
01:24:56,425 --> 01:24:57,926
God does too.

1107
01:25:03,098 --> 01:25:07,644
Is there anyone you want
me to call for you?

1108
01:25:07,644 --> 01:25:09,313
Anyone you want to
know that you're here?
