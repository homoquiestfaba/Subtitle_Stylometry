00:00:24,224 --> 00:00:28,462
[man's voice]
Monday April 18, 2049, 7am.

2
00:00:28,495 --> 00:00:29,863
Morning glorious!

3
00:00:29,897 --> 00:00:33,367
May I be the first to tell you
how fully stellenarious
you look.

4
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:34,668
As usual.

5
00:00:34,701 --> 00:00:37,271
Don't forget,
science test today.

6
00:00:37,304 --> 00:00:40,541
Plus, if and when
the predicted Class Five
solar flare arrives,

7
00:00:40,574 --> 00:00:43,143
you will for sure
want to check it out.

8
00:00:43,176 --> 00:00:47,314
I know, I know.
This all seemed decidedly
more amusing last night.

9
00:00:50,183 --> 00:00:52,419
Have you had a chance
to check this latest data?

10
00:00:52,452 --> 00:00:55,255
The molecular changes
in Max's marrow...

11
00:00:55,288 --> 00:00:56,523
We're closing in
on it, honey.

12
00:00:56,556 --> 00:01:00,360
I really feel like all of our
hard work is about to pay off.

13
00:01:00,393 --> 00:01:03,430
Why wasn't she in the
mess module for breakfast
this morning?

14
00:01:03,463 --> 00:01:06,067
I don't know.
Are you sure she's
even awake yet?

15
00:01:08,568 --> 00:01:09,670
Zenon?

16
00:01:12,239 --> 00:01:15,109
Zenon, it's 7:45.

17
00:01:15,142 --> 00:01:17,544
Cetus-Lupeedus,
how'd it get to be so late?

18
00:01:17,577 --> 00:01:21,248
Get moving, please.
Your Dad and I have to
get to the lab. Come on.

19
00:01:23,216 --> 00:01:26,220
Remember, you loathe
waking up this way.

20
00:01:26,253 --> 00:01:29,189
Time Minor, Tasks Major.

21
00:01:26,253 --> 00:01:29,189
Oh, shut up.

22
00:01:29,222 --> 00:01:32,560
There's one thing to be
thankful for. At least you
don't live down there.

23
00:02:01,521 --> 00:02:03,491
I'm going to be
in so much trouble.

24
00:02:07,561 --> 00:02:09,597
Excuse me, coming through.

25
00:02:11,798 --> 00:02:14,334
The kitchen,
Zenon, is closed.

26
00:02:14,367 --> 00:02:17,638
No, wait! I didn't...
Wait, wait... No! Ow! Ow!

27
00:02:17,671 --> 00:02:22,510
[computer voice] Decompression
drill at 1100 hours.

28
00:02:26,413 --> 00:02:28,315
Overslept again, huh?

29
00:02:28,348 --> 00:02:30,284
Thanks, Gemma.
You're a life saver.

30
00:02:36,289 --> 00:02:37,725
Excuse me. Coming through.

31
00:02:38,692 --> 00:02:41,195
Come on. Hurry.

32
00:02:41,228 --> 00:02:43,597
No... Wait, wait, wait!
No, no, no, no!

33
00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:46,800
Not good. This is not good.

34
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:49,536
Also the fusion trays
in the cafeteria
are misfiring.

35
00:02:49,569 --> 00:02:51,738
Tell Andy in
engineering to use...

36
00:02:51,771 --> 00:02:55,676
Oh! Morning glorious,
Commander Plank.

37
00:02:55,709 --> 00:02:57,778
Walk, Zenon. Walk.

38
00:03:08,588 --> 00:03:12,292
[voice on PA] Electrical
malfunction in
elevator number three.

39
00:03:12,325 --> 00:03:15,429
Please use alternate routes.

40
00:03:12,325 --> 00:03:15,429
[electrical zapping]

41
00:03:15,462 --> 00:03:20,634
[voices overlapping]

42
00:03:20,667 --> 00:03:24,405
[zapping]

43
00:03:20,667 --> 00:03:24,405
[woman] This sound
is hurting my ears.

44
00:03:40,754 --> 00:03:42,289
Yes!

45
00:03:54,401 --> 00:03:56,403
[man] Hold it! Watch out!

46
00:04:00,407 --> 00:04:01,742
[man 2] Zenon!

47
00:04:07,847 --> 00:04:10,751
[girl] Late again, girl.

48
00:04:07,847 --> 00:04:10,751
[boy] You're gonna
get busted.

49
00:04:12,886 --> 00:04:15,256
[chattering continues]

50
00:04:19,392 --> 00:04:21,528
Good morning, class.

51
00:04:19,392 --> 00:04:21,528
Good morning, Mr. Perez.

52
00:04:21,561 --> 00:04:23,630
As we were saying yesterday,

53
00:04:23,663 --> 00:04:27,367
perhaps the most remarkable
thing about President Clinton

54
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:29,803
is that, unlike
her father, Bill,

55
00:04:29,836 --> 00:04:33,607
who also held the office at
the close of the last century,

56
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:38,378
President Chelsea Clinton
has taken a forceful
and unwavering stand

57
00:04:38,411 --> 00:04:41,381
in favor of the harvesting
of underwater vegetation

58
00:04:41,414 --> 00:04:44,384
as a major source
of energy and food.

59
00:04:44,417 --> 00:04:47,521
Ms. Clinton believes
our oceans are
the new frontier.

60
00:04:47,554 --> 00:04:49,523
She has repeatedly
stated a firm...

61
00:04:49,556 --> 00:04:52,492
[man's voice] ...one of the
hottest groups in rock,
Microbe,

62
00:04:52,525 --> 00:04:53,827
and lead singer, Proto Zoa,

63
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:56,730
will become the first group
to perform live in space.

64
00:04:56,763 --> 00:04:59,566
They are going to appear
on the WyndComm Space Station
next month.

65
00:04:59,599 --> 00:05:00,601
[squeals]

66
00:05:02,535 --> 00:05:04,504
Zenon Kar?

67
00:05:04,537 --> 00:05:07,674
Is there something you wish
to share with the class? Hmm?

68
00:05:07,707 --> 00:05:09,676
Uh... no, Mr. Perez.

69
00:05:09,709 --> 00:05:14,448
I guess I got all
flared-up because...

70
00:05:14,481 --> 00:05:16,917
I never knew history
could be so thrilling.

71
00:05:18,818 --> 00:05:22,356
Ah! I'm glad
you're thrilled.

72
00:05:18,818 --> 00:05:22,356
Yeah.

73
00:05:24,457 --> 00:05:28,729
As I was saying,
Chelsea Clinton
has taken a...

74
00:05:28,762 --> 00:05:31,631
When I tell you the
real reason I squeaked,
you're gonna go nova.

75
00:05:31,664 --> 00:05:34,835
No, no, wait.
Super nova, guaranteed.

76
00:05:31,664 --> 00:05:34,835
Oh, just tell me.

77
00:05:34,868 --> 00:05:37,437
Microbe is coming here!

78
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:39,606
For the very first
rock concert in space.

79
00:05:39,639 --> 00:05:41,608
[screaming]

80
00:05:41,641 --> 00:05:43,410
What happened? What'd I miss?

81
00:05:43,443 --> 00:05:46,813
Zenon says Microbe's coming
right to this very station.

82
00:05:46,846 --> 00:05:49,649
Not a Giant Screen
performance, not a hologram.

83
00:05:49,682 --> 00:05:52,719
They're appearing in their
heart-fluttering flesh.

84
00:05:52,752 --> 00:05:56,523
I heard it on the CRR News!

85
00:05:52,752 --> 00:05:56,523
[all screaming]

86
00:05:56,556 --> 00:05:59,526
Zenon, please,
control yourself.

87
00:05:59,559 --> 00:06:02,629
Control myself? Yes, sir,
Commander. Lieutenant Schiff.

88
00:06:03,563 --> 00:06:04,664
Control myself.

89
00:06:04,697 --> 00:06:06,400
Control myself?

90
00:06:06,433 --> 00:06:08,969
When my all-time Crush Major
is coming to our humble halls?

91
00:06:09,903 --> 00:06:10,971
[squealing quietly]

92
00:06:11,004 --> 00:06:13,907
Let's spread the word!

93
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:18,479
[girls] Microbe's coming!
Microbe's coming!

94
00:06:20,046 --> 00:06:24,885
Microbe? They're about
as thermo as some band
from back in 2025.

95
00:06:24,918 --> 00:06:28,522
According to who, Aquila?
They happen to be
the greatest ever.

96
00:06:28,555 --> 00:06:31,892
Their songs have melodies.
I mean, those guys are
so anti-matter

97
00:06:31,925 --> 00:06:33,760
you can actually
understand their lyrics.

98
00:06:33,793 --> 00:06:36,496
What'd you expect?

99
00:06:33,793 --> 00:06:36,496
[both] Men!

100
00:06:36,529 --> 00:06:41,001
Wait, wait. I still haven't
told you the best part.
They're having a contest.

101
00:06:41,034 --> 00:06:44,805
The winner gets to dance
on stage with Proto Zoa!
Can you believe it?

102
00:06:44,838 --> 00:06:47,674
I'm going to get
to dance with Proto Zoa!

103
00:06:47,707 --> 00:06:49,009
Who said it's
gonna be you?

104
00:06:50,243 --> 00:06:52,479
What is she,
new in the galaxy?

105
00:06:52,512 --> 00:06:54,881
Ladies and gentlemen.
Ladies and gentlemen.

106
00:06:54,914 --> 00:06:59,519
May I have your attention
for a moment.
Please? Thank you.

107
00:06:59,552 --> 00:07:02,456
Now, as all of you
undoubtedly already know,

108
00:07:02,489 --> 00:07:05,659
given that gossip travels
at the speed of light
here in space...

109
00:07:05,692 --> 00:07:08,662
[laughter]

110
00:07:08,695 --> 00:07:11,531
...Parker Wyndham, owner
and chief operating officer

111
00:07:11,564 --> 00:07:13,467
of our parent company,
WyndComm,

112
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:15,969
will be paying our
space station
a visit on Friday.

113
00:07:16,002 --> 00:07:18,238
[murmuring]

114
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:19,773
Shh, shh, shh...

115
00:07:19,806 --> 00:07:21,675
Now, I don't think
I'm giving away any secrets

116
00:07:21,708 --> 00:07:25,011
when I say this has not
been our finest year.

117
00:07:25,044 --> 00:07:28,682
March we had
cooling system leaks,
May brought power blackouts.

118
00:07:28,715 --> 00:07:32,052
And that
small, unfortunate
computer room fire.

119
00:07:32,085 --> 00:07:34,521
Yes, that small fire.

120
00:07:34,554 --> 00:07:37,824
Well, our space station
is 27 years old, people.

121
00:07:37,857 --> 00:07:40,861
The fact is, it needs major
improvements and repairs.

122
00:07:40,894 --> 00:07:42,796
And since many of you
are so close

123
00:07:42,829 --> 00:07:46,700
to successfully
completing your most
prodigious experiments,

124
00:07:46,733 --> 00:07:50,003
it would be a shame to have
Wyndham shut us down
at such a juncture.

125
00:07:50,036 --> 00:07:52,839
Well, he'll never do that
because we won't
let him, right?

126
00:07:52,872 --> 00:07:55,775
[cheering]

127
00:07:55,808 --> 00:08:00,280
Yes, I know. I know we feel
that way, but our job is
to convince Wyndham.

128
00:08:00,313 --> 00:08:03,517
We need to get him excited
about our research,
to show him things.

129
00:08:04,851 --> 00:08:06,753
Like the fine work
on bone marrow density

130
00:08:06,786 --> 00:08:08,689
being done by
Mark and Astrid Kar,

131
00:08:10,657 --> 00:08:14,728
that could literally
save millions of lives.

132
00:08:14,761 --> 00:08:17,130
Wyndham needs to understand
why so many of us

133
00:08:17,163 --> 00:08:20,600
have devoted so much of our
lives to this place.

134
00:08:20,633 --> 00:08:24,638
He needs to see that we are
a dedicated, hard-working,

135
00:08:24,671 --> 00:08:26,540
cost-conscious asset

136
00:08:26,573 --> 00:08:29,309
that he simply
cannot afford to abandon!

137
00:08:29,342 --> 00:08:30,911
[cheering]

138
00:08:32,645 --> 00:08:34,915
Now, I'm counting
on each and every one of you.

139
00:08:38,117 --> 00:08:39,887
I know you will
make me proud.

140
00:08:47,193 --> 00:08:49,696
[applause]

141
00:08:55,034 --> 00:08:56,870
[computer voice]
Sterilizer activated.

142
00:08:56,903 --> 00:08:58,138
[buzzing]

143
00:08:59,939 --> 00:09:03,076
Sorry to barge, you guys,
but I'm in
Hysteria Mode Major.

144
00:09:03,109 --> 00:09:05,979
What's gonna
happen to us if the
Wyndham beast rockets up

145
00:09:06,012 --> 00:09:08,682
and hangs a condemned sign
on our space-stay?

146
00:09:08,715 --> 00:09:11,017
Slow down, Zee.
Retro-fire.

147
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:14,921
But I've been here since
I was five, and I don't want
to live anyplace else.

148
00:09:14,954 --> 00:09:17,958
No one is going
anywhere.

149
00:09:14,954 --> 00:09:17,958
But Commander Plank said...

150
00:09:17,991 --> 00:09:22,195
All we have to do is convince
Wyndham how valuable
our work is, so we will.

151
00:09:22,228 --> 00:09:24,965
We couldn't do our experiments
anywhere but a space station.

152
00:09:24,998 --> 00:09:28,101
Because you need a lab with
a weightless chamber. I know.

153
00:09:28,835 --> 00:09:30,770
Hi, Cleo.

154
00:09:30,803 --> 00:09:32,772
[Astrid] She actually listens
to us once in a while.

155
00:09:32,805 --> 00:09:34,908
Wow.

156
00:09:34,941 --> 00:09:38,044
So, Wyndham would have to be a
Scrooge Major to shut us down?

157
00:09:38,077 --> 00:09:40,814
Oh, exactly.
I mean, once he is here,

158
00:09:40,847 --> 00:09:44,084
we will blast him
into orbital bliss Major,

159
00:09:44,117 --> 00:09:46,219
with all the great things
our scientists are doing.

160
00:09:46,252 --> 00:09:48,855
If you're so concerned
about his visit, help out.

161
00:09:49,188 --> 00:09:50,590
How?

162
00:09:50,623 --> 00:09:53,927
Start by trying to keep
your gang in line while
Wyndham's aboard.

163
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:56,196
No air duct cruising,
no recycle bin diving,

164
00:09:56,229 --> 00:09:59,132
and please, please,
try to stay out of
restricted zones.

165
00:09:59,165 --> 00:10:02,135
OK.

166
00:09:59,165 --> 00:10:02,135
Thank you.

167
00:10:02,168 --> 00:10:05,606
You'd fully blow an O-ring
if we had to return to Earth,
huh, Mom?

168
00:10:07,674 --> 00:10:08,742
Mom?

169
00:10:08,775 --> 00:10:10,744
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Absolutely.

170
00:10:11,878 --> 00:10:14,214
Hey honey, um,

171
00:10:14,247 --> 00:10:16,416
why don't you let us get back
to work, OK, sweetheart?

172
00:10:16,449 --> 00:10:18,085
See you at dinner?

173
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:22,756
Love you.

174
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:22,756
Bye.

175
00:10:26,092 --> 00:10:27,260
[rock music plays]

176
00:10:27,293 --> 00:10:30,430
I think that if Microbe's
coming all the way from Earth,

177
00:10:30,463 --> 00:10:34,701
somebody's getting
rich off of it.

178
00:10:30,463 --> 00:10:34,701
So young and yet so cynical.

179
00:10:34,734 --> 00:10:37,270
Everything down there
is motivated by money.

180
00:10:37,303 --> 00:10:40,206
Everything down there
is motivated by self-defense.

181
00:10:40,239 --> 00:10:45,145
You've gotta watch for germs,
speeding trucks, earthquakes,
madmen, muggers...

182
00:10:45,178 --> 00:10:47,013
You were in kindergarten
when we came up here.

183
00:10:47,046 --> 00:10:48,882
My mom's told me stories.

184
00:10:48,915 --> 00:10:51,785
She was in that horrible
earthquake back in '35.

185
00:10:51,818 --> 00:10:53,753
And once she got robbed
at gunpoint.

186
00:10:53,786 --> 00:10:56,890
Why do you think her mom
was so anxious to
bring her up here?

187
00:10:56,923 --> 00:10:58,458
Can I borrow this?

188
00:10:56,923 --> 00:10:58,458
Yes.

189
00:10:58,491 --> 00:11:02,696
Down on Earth, people with
runny noses are packed
together like microchips.

190
00:11:02,729 --> 00:11:04,864
Yeah,
I've never even sneezed.

191
00:11:04,897 --> 00:11:07,867
Plus, Earth's gravity
adds about 30 pounds to you.

192
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:09,136
Can you imagine playing?

193
00:11:11,938 --> 00:11:14,307
The weather? One minute
you have rain, then snow.

194
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:16,209
Then a fully
anti-matter tornado.

195
00:11:16,242 --> 00:11:18,478
How would you ever know
what to wear? This too?

196
00:11:16,242 --> 00:11:18,478
Yes.

197
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:22,015
Face it, our lives are like
a day at the Jovian moon
compared to theirs.

198
00:11:22,048 --> 00:11:25,051
Yeah, yeah.
But I still think...

199
00:11:22,048 --> 00:11:25,051
Don't, OK?

200
00:11:25,084 --> 00:11:27,220
That's when he ends up
in trouble.

201
00:11:27,253 --> 00:11:29,189
We'll have to ice
while Wyndham's here.

202
00:11:29,222 --> 00:11:32,892
It's only three or four days.
How hard can it possibly be?

203
00:11:32,925 --> 00:11:36,830
For you? Impossible.

204
00:11:32,925 --> 00:11:36,830
Lunarious bracelet, Neb.

205
00:11:36,863 --> 00:11:39,966
Thanks. I found the disks in
a Satellite Lab recycling bin.

206
00:11:39,999 --> 00:11:41,367
They have the best throwaways.

207
00:11:41,401 --> 00:11:46,072
I decorated two whole t-shirts
with their discards.
I'll show you.

208
00:11:46,105 --> 00:11:50,176
As fascinating as this is,
are we gonna do something
tonight or what?

209
00:11:50,209 --> 00:11:52,779
Oh, it would be stellar
if we could catch

210
00:11:52,812 --> 00:11:54,314
the Class Five Solar Flare
that's due.

211
00:11:54,347 --> 00:11:56,783
That won't peak 'til 4:00
this morning.

212
00:11:56,816 --> 00:11:59,886
What better way to enjoy it
with Adult Interference Minor?

213
00:12:03,389 --> 00:12:06,025
I can't believe you guys
are chickening out on me.

214
00:12:06,058 --> 00:12:09,295
If my dad found out
I swiped the code book
to get us down here,

215
00:12:09,328 --> 00:12:11,131
he'll go into global meltdown.

216
00:12:11,164 --> 00:12:12,332
Why?

217
00:12:12,365 --> 00:12:15,335
Tell him we simply needed
to gain a deeper understanding

218
00:12:15,368 --> 00:12:17,103
of our native environment.

219
00:12:17,136 --> 00:12:19,539
Couldn't you be happy
watching the thing in here?

220
00:12:19,572 --> 00:12:21,541
I mean,
we have a perfect view.

221
00:12:21,574 --> 00:12:25,812
Why be in the audience, Neb,
when you have a chance
to be center stage?

222
00:12:26,813 --> 00:12:28,115
Come on.

223
00:12:34,821 --> 00:12:36,189
[hissing]

224
00:12:36,222 --> 00:12:40,227
All right,
let's rock and roll! Whoo!

225
00:12:45,231 --> 00:12:49,836
Now remember,
if you hear anybody coming,
tug on my tether.

226
00:12:52,305 --> 00:12:54,007
Are you sure about this?

227
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:56,243
Trust me, Lynx,
it's the only way to fly!

228
00:13:04,350 --> 00:13:06,352
Good to go!

229
00:13:06,385 --> 00:13:09,956
I hope she knows
what she's doing.

230
00:13:06,385 --> 00:13:09,956
[Nebula] Yeah. Me, too.

231
00:13:11,224 --> 00:13:12,325
Whoa.

232
00:13:19,031 --> 00:13:20,066
[squealing]

233
00:14:30,937 --> 00:14:32,105
[gasping]

234
00:14:32,138 --> 00:14:33,273
[groaning]

235
00:14:55,728 --> 00:14:58,431
I don't understand
why I'm getting all the blame?

236
00:14:58,464 --> 00:15:00,466
The other kids
were down there, too.

237
00:15:00,499 --> 00:15:04,437
Excuse me, but were the
other kids out of the craft?

238
00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:07,240
Lynx told her mother
the entire thing
was your idea.

239
00:15:07,273 --> 00:15:10,076
Really nice!
Why would she go
and say that?

240
00:15:10,109 --> 00:15:13,313
Oh, I don't know.
Probably because
everything always is.

241
00:15:15,514 --> 00:15:18,117
Must make you proud to know
you're raising a leader, huh?

242
00:15:18,150 --> 00:15:20,954
Stow the jokes, Zenon.
This is serious.

243
00:15:20,987 --> 00:15:25,291
You guys are constantly
begging me to take
a greater interest in science.

244
00:15:25,324 --> 00:15:29,295
Then tonight when
I finally do, everyone gets
all gaseous on me.

245
00:15:29,328 --> 00:15:32,465
An unauthorized
middle-of-the-night space walk

246
00:15:32,498 --> 00:15:34,367
is hardly what we had in mind.

247
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:36,469
Sweetheart, what if
your tether broke?

248
00:15:36,502 --> 00:15:39,238
What if we got bombarded
by a sudden meteor shower?

249
00:15:39,271 --> 00:15:44,110
I can handle myself. I'm 13.

250
00:15:39,271 --> 00:15:44,110
Then you better
start acting like it.

251
00:15:45,411 --> 00:15:48,315
You have to admit,
it was pretty stellar.

252
00:15:51,283 --> 00:15:54,754
It was probably the best one
we will ever have
an opportunity to see.

253
00:15:54,787 --> 00:15:57,457
Those colors were undulating.
It was almost
like a religious ex...

254
00:15:59,425 --> 00:16:01,527
You were still very
wrong to go out in it.

255
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:05,198
That is exactly the kind
of thing that cannot happen
when Wyndham's here.

256
00:16:05,231 --> 00:16:07,200
Are we clear?

257
00:16:05,231 --> 00:16:07,200
Yes, ma'am.

258
00:16:07,233 --> 00:16:10,370
It's tough, but if we
don't buckle down while
Wyndham's here,

259
00:16:10,403 --> 00:16:12,572
he could have
our mission scrubbed.

260
00:16:12,605 --> 00:16:16,042
Scrubbed, Zenon.
As in over for all of us.

261
00:16:16,075 --> 00:16:18,111
Do you want to be a part
of causing that?

262
00:16:19,812 --> 00:16:24,617
You know that
I would only say
this as a last resort,

263
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:29,322
but mess up again and
your father and I will be
forced to ground you.

264
00:16:29,355 --> 00:16:31,057
[electronic beeping]

265
00:16:33,492 --> 00:16:37,430
That is the third time this
month you have pushed her
into the Stress Helmet.

266
00:16:37,463 --> 00:16:39,065
I know.

267
00:16:39,098 --> 00:16:41,200
Behave before she ends up
in the Chill Chamber.

268
00:16:41,233 --> 00:16:42,435
I know, you're right.

269
00:16:45,538 --> 00:16:47,440
[both] But those colors
were stellar!

270
00:16:52,478 --> 00:16:55,381
Want to see my entry
for the Microbe contest?

271
00:16:55,414 --> 00:16:59,285
It's not finished or anything,
but what do you think?

272
00:16:59,652 --> 00:17:01,454
[gasping]

273
00:17:01,487 --> 00:17:04,123
I didn't know
you could do
a whole sculpture.

274
00:17:04,156 --> 00:17:08,294
Man, I just did a dumb essay
about what dancing with Proto
Zoa would mean to me.

275
00:17:08,327 --> 00:17:10,296
You're a lunarious
writer, Neb.

276
00:17:10,329 --> 00:17:12,265
I'm sure it was
Impressive Major.

277
00:17:12,298 --> 00:17:14,233
Mm-hmm.

278
00:17:14,266 --> 00:17:17,103
You don't have any
stellar chain I could use
for his guitar, do you?

279
00:17:17,136 --> 00:17:19,672
No. But tomorrow's
compactor day.

280
00:17:17,136 --> 00:17:19,672
Right, right.

281
00:17:19,705 --> 00:17:22,642
I'm sure the Discard Bin's
filled with all kinds of junk.

282
00:17:22,675 --> 00:17:25,478
Let's go.

283
00:17:22,675 --> 00:17:25,478
Can't. Math homework.

284
00:17:25,511 --> 00:17:28,147
Oh, yeah.

285
00:17:25,511 --> 00:17:28,147
Have you met
the Wyndham beast yet?

286
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:30,683
Not yet. But I heard
he got in a few hours ago.

287
00:17:30,716 --> 00:17:34,520
And because life isn't hard
enough, Plank-the-Blank
plucked my parents

288
00:17:34,553 --> 00:17:39,425
into being his tour guides.
Pressure Major or what?

289
00:17:39,458 --> 00:17:42,562
[computer voice]
Artificial gravity
malfunction in level four.

290
00:17:42,595 --> 00:17:43,997
Artificial gravity
malfunction...

291
00:17:44,030 --> 00:17:49,335
And right down here you see
the biology lab and
the anti-gravity.

292
00:17:50,336 --> 00:17:53,306
Mom, Dad!

293
00:17:53,339 --> 00:17:55,341
I've been looking all over
for you guys.

294
00:17:55,374 --> 00:17:56,643
Uh-huh.

295
00:17:57,910 --> 00:18:01,214
Mr. Wyndham.
Hi, I'm Zenon.

296
00:18:01,247 --> 00:18:04,283
I didn't mean to interrupt
your tour, but I've heard
so much about you.

297
00:18:04,316 --> 00:18:06,319
I couldn't wait
to make your acquaintance.

298
00:18:06,352 --> 00:18:08,221
It's a pleasure
to meet you.

299
00:18:08,254 --> 00:18:10,890
This is my
assistant, Mr. Lutz.

300
00:18:08,254 --> 00:18:10,890
Hi.

301
00:18:10,923 --> 00:18:14,193
Oh, is that Proto Zoa I see?

302
00:18:10,923 --> 00:18:14,193
Oh, yeah.

303
00:18:14,226 --> 00:18:16,729
You know, I happen to be
quite a microscope fan myself.

304
00:18:16,762 --> 00:18:19,632
I'm considering coming back up
for the concert next month.

305
00:18:20,566 --> 00:18:22,201
You'll be attending?

306
00:18:22,234 --> 00:18:25,338
Oh, wouldn't miss it for all
the stardust in the galaxy.

307
00:18:25,371 --> 00:18:28,474
[all laughing]

308
00:18:28,507 --> 00:18:31,344
Tell me, Zenon,
and tell me honestly,

309
00:18:31,377 --> 00:18:33,246
how do you like living
up here in space?

310
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:38,918
Well, the life your
very generous support

311
00:18:38,951 --> 00:18:41,254
has created for me
and my rads

312
00:18:41,287 --> 00:18:45,691
is the most lunarious
and interesting way any kid
could hope to grow up.

313
00:18:45,724 --> 00:18:50,263
The experiments,
the research we get to watch,
the amazing teamwork,

314
00:18:50,296 --> 00:18:52,498
the unique view
of the universe...

315
00:18:52,531 --> 00:18:56,435
Thank you, Mr. Wyndham.
Thank you.

316
00:18:56,468 --> 00:19:00,339
Well, let me just say,
if you ever consider
a career in PR, my dear,

317
00:19:00,372 --> 00:19:02,742
WyndComm Enterprises could
definitely use your services.

318
00:19:03,676 --> 00:19:05,645
And how. Well...

319
00:19:05,678 --> 00:19:09,949
Well, uh, math homework.
Sorry.

320
00:19:09,982 --> 00:19:12,652
Uh, right down here
we have the cryogenics lab.

321
00:19:12,685 --> 00:19:17,223
She's very verbal.

322
00:19:12,685 --> 00:19:17,223
[Mark] Zenon's never short
on energy.

323
00:19:17,256 --> 00:19:20,359
As soon as I told Mr. Wyndham
I loved TurboMaster movies,

324
00:19:20,392 --> 00:19:23,796
he started quoting
all the dialogue,
doing all the voices.

325
00:19:23,829 --> 00:19:25,030
It was hilarious.

326
00:19:25,064 --> 00:19:28,234
You know, when he looked over
my mom's Reflex System data,

327
00:19:28,267 --> 00:19:31,404
he actually understood it.
Not even my dad can do that.

328
00:19:31,437 --> 00:19:33,673
[Zenon] Something about
that guy shivers me out.

329
00:19:33,706 --> 00:19:37,310
What are you talking about?
I mean, he's a great guy.

330
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:40,780
Calling Planet Leo.
The only thing that should
be that smooth and oily

331
00:19:40,813 --> 00:19:43,249
is a propulsion module
solar coil.

332
00:19:43,282 --> 00:19:45,551
This is from the girl
that said I was cynical.

333
00:19:45,584 --> 00:19:46,986
I wish I could
explain it more.

334
00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:51,524
I just get the very creepy
feeling that something
doesn't quite fit.

335
00:19:51,557 --> 00:19:53,759
Sorry, but every time
you get one of these feelings,

336
00:19:53,792 --> 00:19:57,664
it always ends up
in Disaster Major.

337
00:19:53,792 --> 00:19:57,664
[Wyndham laughing]

338
00:20:10,643 --> 00:20:11,744
[gasping]

339
00:20:30,062 --> 00:20:31,364
[grunting]

340
00:20:59,625 --> 00:21:01,761
[screaming, grunting]

341
00:21:01,794 --> 00:21:03,863
[gasping] Good evening.

342
00:21:07,399 --> 00:21:09,402
Hi.

343
00:21:09,435 --> 00:21:12,705
Do you always hang out
in trash bins in
the middle of the night?

344
00:21:12,738 --> 00:21:16,809
I've, uh, uh...
...killer insomnia, ya know?

345
00:21:16,842 --> 00:21:19,545
Going down there
really helps to Zen me out.

346
00:21:19,578 --> 00:21:21,514
Fascinating.

347
00:21:21,547 --> 00:21:23,683
You're up kinda
late yourself.

348
00:21:23,716 --> 00:21:28,688
Mr. Wyndham likes the latest
interglobal stock quotations
when he wakes up.

349
00:21:28,721 --> 00:21:32,391
And I was hoping
that I could use these
computers to get a jump on it.

350
00:21:32,424 --> 00:21:34,827
Oh. It wouldn't help
to go in here.

351
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:36,729
This is just
the Main Memory Bank.

352
00:21:39,131 --> 00:21:43,602
Besides, it's a
restricted area.
Class Four.

353
00:21:43,635 --> 00:21:48,341
"Any unauthorized presence
will be a Danger Major
to the entire base."

354
00:21:48,374 --> 00:21:52,945
Thank you very much
for enlightening me.
Well, goodnight now.

355
00:21:52,978 --> 00:21:55,681
Aren't you going upstairs?

356
00:21:52,978 --> 00:21:55,681
Soon enough.

357
00:21:55,714 --> 00:21:57,616
Pleasant dreams.

358
00:21:57,649 --> 00:21:59,418
Hmm...

359
00:21:57,649 --> 00:21:59,418
What?

360
00:21:59,451 --> 00:22:02,722
It's so dark
and inky around here,

361
00:22:02,755 --> 00:22:06,726
I'd hate to have to go
all the way up to
the habitation module alone.

362
00:22:07,693 --> 00:22:08,728
Please?

363
00:22:08,761 --> 00:22:11,397
My goodness,
you are exhausting.

364
00:22:11,730 --> 00:22:13,666
Perfect, huh?

365
00:22:13,699 --> 00:22:16,736
Now that I've exhausted you,
you might as well go up
and go to sleep.

366
00:22:22,007 --> 00:22:23,543
Thanks.

367
00:22:26,512 --> 00:22:27,747
[Perez]
For thousands of years

368
00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:31,884
regular polyhedrons have been
a source of great fascination

369
00:22:31,917 --> 00:22:34,620
for mathematicians
and scientists alike.

370
00:22:34,653 --> 00:22:38,624
The philosophers of ancient
Greece looked at these
principles

371
00:22:38,657 --> 00:22:41,594
as the universe's
guiding forces.

372
00:22:41,627 --> 00:22:44,797
It was the conjecture of the
great philosopher, Pythagoras,

373
00:22:44,830 --> 00:22:48,467
that our universe
was ruled by numbers,

374
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:51,871
that all forces of nature
obeyed their
very specific laws.

375
00:22:51,904 --> 00:22:53,406
[crashing]

376
00:22:53,439 --> 00:22:55,808
Polyhedrons have been
a source...

377
00:22:55,841 --> 00:22:58,944
I know why you're so wiped.
You stayed up to
tail Wyndham's toady?

378
00:22:58,977 --> 00:23:00,713
Lutz-the-Klutz? Yeah.

379
00:23:00,746 --> 00:23:02,882
He's itching to get into
that Memory Bank.

380
00:23:02,915 --> 00:23:04,884
You told your mother
your suspicions?

381
00:23:04,917 --> 00:23:08,888
She just said I was
into Drama Mode Major.

382
00:23:08,921 --> 00:23:11,590
I'm gonna find out
what Wyndham and Lutz
are really up to.

383
00:23:11,623 --> 00:23:13,859
And then all of you
will be thanking me.

384
00:23:13,892 --> 00:23:15,661
See ya.

385
00:23:13,892 --> 00:23:15,661
Bye.

386
00:23:45,791 --> 00:23:47,893
Bye, Mom.

387
00:23:45,791 --> 00:23:47,893
Honey, honey...

388
00:23:47,926 --> 00:23:49,729
Your dad and I both
really want to say thanks.

389
00:23:50,262 --> 00:23:51,597
For what?

390
00:23:51,630 --> 00:23:53,732
For being terrific
when Wyndham's around.

391
00:23:53,765 --> 00:23:56,836
You are making
a sincere effort to
stay out of trouble,

392
00:23:56,869 --> 00:23:59,505
and we want you to know
that we appreciate it.

393
00:24:01,707 --> 00:24:03,542
Sweat Minor, Mom.

394
00:24:03,575 --> 00:24:06,446
Oh, gotta lift off.
It's a Microbe moment!

395
00:24:07,813 --> 00:24:12,251
? Zoom, zoom, zoom
Make the heart go boom, boom ?

396
00:24:12,284 --> 00:24:15,554
? Zoom, zoom, zoom
Make the heart go
boom, boom ?

397
00:24:15,587 --> 00:24:16,822
I love that song.

398
00:24:16,855 --> 00:24:18,057
[music playing]

399
00:24:18,090 --> 00:24:19,959
? Our love is automatic ?

400
00:24:19,992 --> 00:24:21,694
? Zoom, zoom, zoom ?

401
00:24:21,727 --> 00:24:24,497
Over here! Hurry!

402
00:24:21,727 --> 00:24:24,497
It's starting!

403
00:24:24,530 --> 00:24:25,865
What are you guys doing here?

404
00:24:25,898 --> 00:24:28,000
I thought you fully
loathed Microbe.

405
00:24:28,033 --> 00:24:31,270
We do. We just wanna see
you two go nuclear

406
00:24:31,303 --> 00:24:34,707
when the winner turns out
to be some sub-dwarf
third grader.

407
00:24:37,709 --> 00:24:42,815
[all] Six, five, four,
three, two, one!

408
00:24:42,848 --> 00:24:44,950
[squealing]

409
00:24:44,983 --> 00:24:47,920
Good evening,
out of sight rock and rollers!

410
00:24:47,953 --> 00:24:50,589
Are you primed and pumped
for our arrival?

411
00:24:50,622 --> 00:24:52,558
[squealing]

412
00:24:50,622 --> 00:24:52,558
Could he be
more Gorgeous Major?

413
00:24:52,591 --> 00:24:54,727
I'm gonna faint, I swear.

414
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:58,597
Our judges scrutinized,
criticized and categorized
your entries, space fans.

415
00:24:58,630 --> 00:25:03,035
Now it is time
to declare a winner.

416
00:24:58,630 --> 00:25:03,035
[squealing]

417
00:25:04,036 --> 00:25:06,038
The winning entry is...

418
00:25:07,639 --> 00:25:09,141
Should I maybe milk this
a little bit longer?

419
00:25:09,174 --> 00:25:10,275
No!

420
00:25:10,309 --> 00:25:15,047
The winning entry in the
Dance With Me contest is...

421
00:25:16,615 --> 00:25:19,752
...13-year old Zenon Kar.

422
00:25:19,785 --> 00:25:22,588
I won? I really won?

423
00:25:22,621 --> 00:25:24,056
Big surprise.

424
00:25:24,089 --> 00:25:26,559
[screaming]

425
00:25:29,194 --> 00:25:30,763
Congratulations, Zenon.

426
00:25:30,796 --> 00:25:32,965
I can't wait to get up there
to meet you!

427
00:25:32,998 --> 00:25:34,900
You're so lucky.

428
00:25:34,933 --> 00:25:38,837
The only thing inky about
me winning, Neb,
is it means you didn't.

429
00:25:38,870 --> 00:25:41,907
Hey, my best friend won,
so who cares?

430
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:44,043
Yeah. But I still wish
it could have been
the both of us.

431
00:25:44,076 --> 00:25:45,911
Thanks. Me, too.

432
00:25:45,944 --> 00:25:50,649
Hey! Good. There you are.
Look... You can't keep it
or anything.

433
00:25:50,682 --> 00:25:53,118
Just write down what you need,
and give it back quick.

434
00:25:53,151 --> 00:25:55,120
Thanks, Leo. I owe you.

435
00:25:53,151 --> 00:25:55,120
Yeah.

436
00:25:55,153 --> 00:25:58,724
But if you get popped,
don't tell them where
you got the code.

437
00:25:58,757 --> 00:26:01,027
What code?

438
00:25:58,757 --> 00:26:01,027
Hold this a sec.

439
00:26:02,761 --> 00:26:05,798
Wait. You're not doing this
to spy on Lutz again, are you?

440
00:26:05,831 --> 00:26:08,033
Why not?

441
00:26:05,831 --> 00:26:08,033
Because if you get busted,

442
00:26:08,066 --> 00:26:10,135
you know it's just
gonna ruin everything.

443
00:26:10,168 --> 00:26:12,371
I ever tell you,
you worry too much?

444
00:26:12,404 --> 00:26:16,041
With you for my B.F.,
you better be glad I'm not
dead from the stress.

445
00:26:16,074 --> 00:26:17,843
Oh, I am.

446
00:26:17,876 --> 00:26:19,078
Thanks.

447
00:26:19,111 --> 00:26:20,846
Bye.

448
00:26:19,111 --> 00:26:20,846
Zee!

449
00:26:50,208 --> 00:26:51,611
[banging]

450
00:27:46,932 --> 00:27:47,933
[whimpering]

451
00:27:56,241 --> 00:27:57,777
OK.

452
00:27:58,877 --> 00:28:01,681
One... three...

453
00:28:03,882 --> 00:28:07,086
...five... zero...

454
00:28:08,086 --> 00:28:09,288
Start.

455
00:28:08,086 --> 00:28:09,288
[alarm buzzing]

456
00:28:09,321 --> 00:28:11,056
No, no, no!

457
00:28:11,089 --> 00:28:16,061
One... three...
four... five...

458
00:28:16,094 --> 00:28:17,830
[alarm continues blaring]

459
00:28:20,899 --> 00:28:24,170
I'm so glad you're here.
There was this guy, and...

460
00:28:25,303 --> 00:28:26,972
Commander Plank!

461
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:29,875
We need to talk.

462
00:28:31,143 --> 00:28:33,045
Yes, we do.

463
00:28:33,078 --> 00:28:35,080
Why won't you guys
listen to me?

464
00:28:35,113 --> 00:28:36,882
I didn't break into
the Memory Bank.

465
00:28:36,915 --> 00:28:39,284
Lutz did. I was only
down there to spy on him.

466
00:28:39,317 --> 00:28:41,787
Because...?

467
00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:45,958
Because I knew he was up
to something inky and
nobody would listen to me!

468
00:28:45,991 --> 00:28:50,162
Would you mind telling me
what led you to this
outrageous conclusion?

469
00:28:50,195 --> 00:28:53,298
For one thing, Wyndham's eyes.
Have you ever looked at 'em?

470
00:28:53,331 --> 00:28:57,102
I mean, when he's lying,
they do this flickering thing.

471
00:28:57,135 --> 00:29:00,205
And since everybody else
is so convinced
he's up here to help us,

472
00:29:00,238 --> 00:29:02,975
I was fully following my gut
to prove he's not.

473
00:29:03,008 --> 00:29:04,977
I spoke to Mr. Lutz
and Mr. Wyndham.

474
00:29:05,010 --> 00:29:07,212
Neither has been out
of his quarters since dinner.

475
00:29:07,245 --> 00:29:11,884
That's not true!
They're lying! I saw Lutz.

476
00:29:11,917 --> 00:29:14,987
Why would I be making this up?

477
00:29:11,917 --> 00:29:14,987
An attempt to save
your own skin.

478
00:29:15,020 --> 00:29:16,021
[Mark] Commander!

479
00:29:18,156 --> 00:29:21,560
The security team says
you didn't tamper with
the data banks.

480
00:29:21,593 --> 00:29:23,829
And for that we can
all be grateful.

481
00:29:23,862 --> 00:29:26,865
I don't think you realize
how serious this is, Zenon.

482
00:29:26,898 --> 00:29:28,367
Being in a Class Four zone,

483
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:31,170
you could've put everybody
on this station at risk.

484
00:29:31,203 --> 00:29:33,005
But I didn't do anything!

485
00:29:33,038 --> 00:29:35,107
Clearly, not for
lack of trying.

486
00:29:35,140 --> 00:29:36,375
Silence Major!

487
00:29:39,277 --> 00:29:42,047
This is the last straw, Zenon.

488
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:45,384
Now I'm leaving the punishment
to your discretion,
but do know this.

489
00:29:45,417 --> 00:29:48,220
Unless you impose a sentence
as severe as the crime,

490
00:29:49,287 --> 00:29:51,156
I'll be forced
to take action myself.

491
00:29:51,189 --> 00:29:52,357
But you're not...

492
00:29:51,189 --> 00:29:52,357
Zee!

493
00:29:52,390 --> 00:29:54,126
But listen to me! Please!

494
00:29:52,390 --> 00:29:54,126
Let's go.

495
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:56,195
No!

496
00:29:59,164 --> 00:30:03,369
I honestly think if
you put these on,
it'll help all of us.

497
00:30:06,338 --> 00:30:09,174
Or not.

498
00:30:09,207 --> 00:30:12,945
You have put us in a very
difficult position, Zenon.

499
00:30:15,113 --> 00:30:19,185
You can't imagine how much
I don't want to do what
I have to do now.

500
00:30:20,218 --> 00:30:22,054
But you haven't left us
any choice.

501
00:30:23,021 --> 00:30:24,056
What?

502
00:30:26,024 --> 00:30:31,930
I'm sorry, Zee.
Your mother... and I...

503
00:30:31,963 --> 00:30:34,099
...have contacted
your Aunt Judy.

504
00:30:35,267 --> 00:30:36,335
Aunt Judy?

505
00:30:38,270 --> 00:30:42,341
She hates space,
she hates to travel.

506
00:30:42,374 --> 00:30:44,844
You wanna bring her up here
to be my "keeper"?

507
00:30:46,077 --> 00:30:49,014
You don't get it, Zee.
We're grounding you.

508
00:30:49,047 --> 00:30:50,182
I understand that.

509
00:30:50,215 --> 00:30:53,853
No, Zee. I mean,
we're really grounding you.

510
00:30:58,356 --> 00:30:59,358
What?

511
00:31:02,961 --> 00:31:06,465
No. No, you can't...

512
00:31:06,498 --> 00:31:09,134
Mom? Mom!

513
00:31:10,268 --> 00:31:11,871
[Astrid] I'm sorry, honey.

514
00:31:12,337 --> 00:31:13,405
Dad?

515
00:31:21,313 --> 00:31:23,949
So, the rumor's true?
Zenon's really outta here?

516
00:31:23,982 --> 00:31:25,284
Isn't it the most
gaseous thing ever?

517
00:31:25,317 --> 00:31:27,686
They're shipping her
off this afternoon.

518
00:31:27,719 --> 00:31:28,887
Wait, wait, wait.

519
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:31,523
[computer voice] All off-duty
personnel to mess module.

520
00:31:31,556 --> 00:31:32,958
Oh!

521
00:31:36,294 --> 00:31:37,396
This is stellar.

522
00:31:37,429 --> 00:31:39,197
Ladies and gentlemen,
Parker Wyndham.

523
00:31:39,230 --> 00:31:41,166
[applause]

524
00:31:48,373 --> 00:31:52,277
When I came up here,
I half expected to
be confronted

525
00:31:52,310 --> 00:31:56,048
with exhaustion
and frustration.

526
00:31:56,081 --> 00:32:00,052
What I found instead
was incredible,
unwavering dedication.

527
00:32:00,085 --> 00:32:04,089
Yes, there's room for
improvement here. Oh, yes.

528
00:32:04,122 --> 00:32:08,160
But, overall, I could not
be prouder of the
great pioneering spirit

529
00:32:08,193 --> 00:32:12,164
that I've encountered up here
on the WyndComm Space Station.

530
00:32:12,197 --> 00:32:17,202
Because of it,
I am hereby pledging
an additional $500 million...

531
00:32:30,081 --> 00:32:34,987
...to go to the perpetuation
and repairs of this,
your beloved base.

532
00:32:35,020 --> 00:32:38,757
Call it a vote of confidence
in the many benefits
I know we will all reap

533
00:32:38,790 --> 00:32:42,761
from the remarkable research
and experimentation being
conducted up here.

534
00:32:42,794 --> 00:32:45,497
Thank you very much.

535
00:32:42,794 --> 00:32:45,497
[cheering]

536
00:32:47,232 --> 00:32:49,368
Thank you.
Thank you so much.

537
00:32:52,103 --> 00:32:54,974
If anyone's reaping benefits,
it has to be you.

538
00:32:58,243 --> 00:33:01,280
[voice on PA] Shuttle
departure in three
minutes from Bay Four.

539
00:33:06,151 --> 00:33:09,388
Shuttle departure in three
minutes from Bay Four.

540
00:33:09,421 --> 00:33:13,359
He's not shutting us down.
He gave us more money.

541
00:33:14,626 --> 00:33:16,395
Maybe you were
wrong about him.

542
00:33:17,429 --> 00:33:19,131
Et tu, Nebula?

543
00:33:20,532 --> 00:33:25,404
Quoting Billy Shakespeare.
You must be inked out.

544
00:33:25,437 --> 00:33:28,507
Well, I made you something.
It's no big deal or anything.

545
00:33:28,540 --> 00:33:30,375
It's for good luck.

546
00:33:30,408 --> 00:33:32,044
Here.

547
00:33:32,077 --> 00:33:35,114
It's lunarious, Neb.
Thanks.

548
00:33:38,583 --> 00:33:42,054
How's that look?

549
00:33:38,583 --> 00:33:42,054
Sincerely stellar.

550
00:33:47,425 --> 00:33:49,461
I'm scared, Nebula.

551
00:33:49,494 --> 00:33:53,165
After all the inky stuff
my mom's told me about Earth,

552
00:33:53,198 --> 00:33:54,633
how am I ever
gonna survive?

553
00:33:56,601 --> 00:34:00,039
Well, avoid tornadoes,

554
00:34:00,605 --> 00:34:02,407
don't drink the water

555
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:04,410
and Data Zap me every day.

556
00:34:09,180 --> 00:34:11,617
I've gotta go.
My ex-parents are coming.

557
00:34:14,452 --> 00:34:15,621
See ya.

558
00:34:20,458 --> 00:34:22,561
Thanks for all your help
and good work.

559
00:34:22,594 --> 00:34:24,329
Yeah. Sure. Thank you.

560
00:34:25,463 --> 00:34:28,067
Stand by
for shuttle departure.

561
00:34:29,601 --> 00:34:32,504
I have to travel all the way
down there with them?

562
00:34:32,537 --> 00:34:36,174
Mr. Wyndham is doing
us a great favor taking
you along on his ship.

563
00:34:36,207 --> 00:34:38,310
Oh yeah, big favor to me.

564
00:34:38,343 --> 00:34:39,611
About ready, ma'am?

565
00:34:39,645 --> 00:34:42,581
If we miss our weather
window, our flight
will be scrubbed today.

566
00:34:43,381 --> 00:34:45,517
Break my heart.

567
00:34:45,550 --> 00:34:50,222
Look, Zee,
we know this is hard.

568
00:34:50,255 --> 00:34:53,558
But why don't you try
to see it like an opportunity,
an adventure?

569
00:34:53,591 --> 00:34:56,595
Yes, you have traveled
the universe,

570
00:34:56,628 --> 00:34:59,465
but you have never really
lived outside of these walls.

571
00:35:03,468 --> 00:35:05,203
Don't worry, honey.

572
00:35:05,236 --> 00:35:08,540
We will bring you back
as fast as we can.

573
00:35:11,342 --> 00:35:12,444
We love you.

574
00:35:27,325 --> 00:35:29,128
[buzzing]

575
00:35:49,247 --> 00:35:51,783
[woman] Is everyone
strapped in back there?

576
00:35:51,816 --> 00:35:53,585
We're ready for lift-off.

577
00:35:54,786 --> 00:35:57,789
[man] Ten...
nine... eight...

578
00:35:57,822 --> 00:36:00,659
seven... six... five...

579
00:36:00,692 --> 00:36:03,662
four... three...
two... one...

580
00:36:06,631 --> 00:36:10,368
We're showing separation.

581
00:36:06,631 --> 00:36:10,368
Roger that.
Confirming separation.

582
00:36:10,401 --> 00:36:13,371
Tango-delta-bravo,
this is WyndComm Center.

583
00:36:13,404 --> 00:36:17,609
We show on-board power
switchover, internal sync
at zero plus minus.

584
00:36:17,642 --> 00:36:21,413
Good and good.

585
00:36:21,446 --> 00:36:26,318
Start emission clock on my
mark. Three... two... one.

586
00:36:26,351 --> 00:36:29,988
Emission clock is running.
We have status created across
the board.

587
00:36:30,021 --> 00:36:32,424
Flight ops says
you are good to go.

588
00:36:32,457 --> 00:36:35,660
[man] Tango-delta-bravo,
we show sub time at
zero-eight-23-zero.

589
00:36:35,693 --> 00:36:38,997
Telemetry, direct reach
to three-two-zero.

590
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:41,466
Three-two-zero. Got that?

591
00:37:11,396 --> 00:37:12,731
[groaning]

592
00:37:16,567 --> 00:37:18,770
[Wyndham]
We'll be there momentarily.

593
00:37:30,581 --> 00:37:33,285
[sneezes]

594
00:37:33,318 --> 00:37:35,487
[woman] Is she OK?

595
00:37:33,318 --> 00:37:35,487
[man] Is she all right?

596
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:37,889
[woman] Are you OK?

597
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:37,889
Thank you, gravity.

598
00:37:37,922 --> 00:37:39,725
[Wyndham]
Are you all right?

599
00:37:40,591 --> 00:37:41,727
I'm fine.

600
00:37:48,499 --> 00:37:49,701
[groaning]

601
00:37:50,735 --> 00:37:53,572
[grunting]

602
00:38:08,953 --> 00:38:12,624
Zenon, your aunt will pick you
up at the main gate.

603
00:38:12,657 --> 00:38:15,527
That's right over there.
Good luck.

604
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:20,432
Ya know, you may fool
a lot of people, Mr. Wyndham,
but just know,

605
00:38:20,465 --> 00:38:22,301
you don't fool me.

606
00:38:26,771 --> 00:38:28,307
[gasping]

607
00:38:32,643 --> 00:38:34,946
What's wrong with you?

608
00:38:32,643 --> 00:38:34,946
Uh, nothing.

609
00:38:34,979 --> 00:38:37,782
Nothing at all. I've got
everything under control.

610
00:38:37,815 --> 00:38:40,719
Fine. Let's go. We're gonna
be late for the meeting.

611
00:38:44,856 --> 00:38:48,860
[distant sirens blaring]

612
00:39:18,022 --> 00:39:19,858
[horn honking]

613
00:39:19,891 --> 00:39:21,860
Doll face, is that you?

614
00:39:21,893 --> 00:39:25,830
You look like the Zenon
I knew as a baby.

615
00:39:25,863 --> 00:39:29,467
Only taller,
and more miserable.

616
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:31,436
[sniffing]
Yeah, afraid so.

617
00:39:31,469 --> 00:39:33,938
Hi! Oh...

618
00:39:33,971 --> 00:39:37,475
I can't believe
you made it. Flying
through space like that.

619
00:39:37,508 --> 00:39:40,412
I would rather face
62 weeks of dental surgery.

620
00:39:40,445 --> 00:39:42,747
Terra firma. That's my motto.
[stamps foot]

621
00:39:42,780 --> 00:39:46,017
The firma the betta.
Get it?

622
00:39:46,050 --> 00:39:49,621
So, how's your mom?
Still skinny as a rail,
I'll bet. Yeah?

623
00:39:49,654 --> 00:39:52,624
Here. Let me get your bag.
[groans]

624
00:39:52,657 --> 00:39:55,527
Are you starved?

625
00:39:52,657 --> 00:39:55,527
I don't know. I guess.

626
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:58,430
Yeah? I'd take you home
and make you something myself,

627
00:39:58,463 --> 00:40:00,965
but I figure
you've been traumatized
enough for one day.

628
00:40:00,998 --> 00:40:03,435
[giggles]

629
00:40:03,935 --> 00:40:05,771
OK... let's go.

630
00:40:07,472 --> 00:40:09,874
Yeah, yeah, OK.
I'm gonna be calling.

631
00:40:09,907 --> 00:40:11,910
Excuse me. Oh!

632
00:40:11,943 --> 00:40:13,445
[sneezes]

633
00:40:15,546 --> 00:40:16,815
Wait!

634
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:31,496
[pop music playing]

635
00:40:31,529 --> 00:40:32,931
Oh, there's a table.

636
00:40:34,565 --> 00:40:36,468
[boy] Take a look
at what's coming.

637
00:40:39,704 --> 00:40:42,674
You don't see that every day.

638
00:40:39,704 --> 00:40:42,674
Who would want to?

639
00:40:46,010 --> 00:40:48,246
Oh, boy.

640
00:40:48,279 --> 00:40:50,715
Why they sent you to me,
I'll never understand.

641
00:40:50,748 --> 00:40:55,653
I know zip about kids.
I didn't even get 'em
when I was one of 'em.

642
00:40:55,686 --> 00:40:59,791
You do eat this
sort of stuff, don't you?
Pizza, burgers, fries?

643
00:40:59,824 --> 00:41:01,126
I've never had any of it.

644
00:41:01,159 --> 00:41:04,896
Our food is
hydroponically grown,
no dirt, no preservatives,

645
00:41:04,929 --> 00:41:06,965
no artificial coloring.

646
00:41:06,998 --> 00:41:11,536
Wow! Put that much purity
into my system,
I'd be dead in 24 hours.

647
00:41:15,606 --> 00:41:18,743
Isn't that outfit viral?

648
00:41:18,776 --> 00:41:21,846
This place doesn't
look like anything
what I've seen on the news.

649
00:41:21,879 --> 00:41:24,716
It's like some
time warped village supreme.

650
00:41:24,749 --> 00:41:26,851
Well, that's part
of its appeal.

651
00:41:26,884 --> 00:41:30,021
All those overhead monorails
and high-rise megaliths

652
00:41:30,054 --> 00:41:33,691
in New York and L.A., it's
enough to make your head spin.

653
00:41:33,724 --> 00:41:36,728
Here, we just let progress
take its sweet time.

654
00:41:36,761 --> 00:41:38,129
Well, listen, hon.

655
00:41:38,162 --> 00:41:40,699
While you decide,
I'm gonna go wash my hands.

656
00:41:43,167 --> 00:41:45,036
Ultra graphic and historic.

657
00:41:45,069 --> 00:41:46,771
Hey... pay attention!

658
00:41:46,804 --> 00:41:48,607
So, like I was saying...

659
00:42:08,859 --> 00:42:12,597
Absolve me from interrupting,
but my pack and I have a bet.

660
00:42:12,630 --> 00:42:17,168
They think that with those
clothes and that do,
or shall I say, "don't",

661
00:42:17,201 --> 00:42:20,872
you must be from some Viral
Extreme place like Eastern
Jersey.

662
00:42:20,905 --> 00:42:25,577
I guessed you were simply
getting a six-month head start
on Halloween.

663
00:42:25,610 --> 00:42:28,146
You win.
It's the Halloween thing.

664
00:42:28,179 --> 00:42:31,616
Now lend me that mask
you're wearing

665
00:42:31,649 --> 00:42:34,019
and I'll have the most hideous
Major costume ever.

666
00:42:35,186 --> 00:42:37,822
Ooh! That was good.

667
00:42:41,092 --> 00:42:43,127
Not bad.

668
00:42:43,160 --> 00:42:46,164
Can we scrub
this mission, please?
I suddenly lost my appetite.

669
00:43:14,992 --> 00:43:17,061
Pretty gorgeous, huh?

670
00:43:17,094 --> 00:43:20,031
They're interesting,
but what's their purpose?

671
00:43:20,064 --> 00:43:23,401
I mean,
our hydroponic chambers
are for producing oxygen,

672
00:43:23,434 --> 00:43:25,770
but you've got plenty of that.

673
00:43:25,803 --> 00:43:29,407
Oh, down here, not everything
has to have a purpose, hon.

674
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:32,210
Some things are
just good for your soul.

675
00:43:50,895 --> 00:43:52,030
[knocking]

676
00:43:53,998 --> 00:43:55,100
Hi.

677
00:43:57,068 --> 00:43:58,303
I know that this is the part

678
00:43:58,336 --> 00:44:02,006
where I'm supposed
to offer great words of
wisdom and comfort,

679
00:44:02,039 --> 00:44:04,976
but that's why
I'm such a bad grownup.

680
00:44:05,009 --> 00:44:08,012
I'm incredibly
inept at this stuff.

681
00:44:08,045 --> 00:44:10,248
Sweat Minor, Aunt Judy.

682
00:44:10,281 --> 00:44:12,283
I'm really glad you're here.

683
00:44:12,316 --> 00:44:17,255
A little family connection,
it's nice. It's been such
a long time.

684
00:44:17,288 --> 00:44:19,157
If you don't mind me asking,

685
00:44:19,190 --> 00:44:23,294
how come you've never gotten
married or had any kids?

686
00:44:23,327 --> 00:44:26,665
Well, unlike you, sweetie,

687
00:44:27,998 --> 00:44:30,101
I've always been petrified

688
00:44:30,134 --> 00:44:34,139
of putting myself out there,
or taking a risk.

689
00:44:35,906 --> 00:44:39,977
Yeah. Look where
it's gotten me.

690
00:44:35,906 --> 00:44:39,977
Oh, no! No, no.

691
00:44:40,010 --> 00:44:42,914
You're my hero.
You're brave.

692
00:44:44,348 --> 00:44:47,118
Well now, on that soul-bearing
little note...

693
00:44:50,287 --> 00:44:51,690
Good night.

694
00:44:54,925 --> 00:44:57,762
Zenon, just...

695
00:44:57,795 --> 00:45:00,699
...know that I'm around
if you need me.

696
00:45:07,905 --> 00:45:10,808
[electronic beeping]

697
00:45:10,841 --> 00:45:13,111
A blocking chip has been
installed in this unit.

698
00:45:13,144 --> 00:45:16,347
Calls can only be made to...

699
00:45:13,144 --> 00:45:16,347
[Astrid] Mark
and Astrid Kar.

700
00:45:16,380 --> 00:45:18,116
What?

701
00:45:16,380 --> 00:45:18,116
A blocking chip...

702
00:45:18,149 --> 00:45:20,084
I heard you, I heard you.

703
00:45:20,117 --> 00:45:21,886
Thanks a metric ton, folks.

704
00:45:21,919 --> 00:45:23,788
Banish me, cut me off...

705
00:45:23,821 --> 00:45:27,125
One Sin Minor and my life
is a living Black Hole!

706
00:45:30,361 --> 00:45:32,230
[chattering]

707
00:45:32,263 --> 00:45:34,165
[beeping]

708
00:45:35,099 --> 00:45:36,234
Hey.

709
00:45:39,203 --> 00:45:40,872
Good morning.

710
00:45:42,239 --> 00:45:44,108
Settle now, please.

711
00:45:44,141 --> 00:45:48,112
If I may have
your attention...

712
00:45:48,145 --> 00:45:51,315
We have a new student
joining us today.
Her name is Radon Kar.

713
00:45:51,348 --> 00:45:53,151
Actually, it's Zenon.

714
00:45:53,184 --> 00:45:56,220
Like that's
a whole lot better?

715
00:45:53,184 --> 00:45:56,220
[laughter]

716
00:45:56,253 --> 00:46:00,191
People, people. Zenon is no
ordinary visiting student.

717
00:46:00,224 --> 00:46:04,095
She comes to us having spent
eight years on the WyndComm
Space Station.

718
00:46:04,128 --> 00:46:05,997
Hope she's had her shots.

719
00:46:06,030 --> 00:46:08,166
[laughter]

720
00:46:06,030 --> 00:46:08,166
Now, that's enough, Margie.

721
00:46:08,199 --> 00:46:12,370
I'm sure there's a great deal
that Zenon can teach us while
she's here,

722
00:46:12,403 --> 00:46:15,406
if you'll all be wise enough
to give her that chance.

723
00:46:15,439 --> 00:46:17,074
[whistle blowing]

724
00:46:17,107 --> 00:46:21,412
Come on, let's go, Tracy!
Come on, let's go...

725
00:46:21,445 --> 00:46:24,382
Come on, pull, pull.

726
00:46:24,415 --> 00:46:27,084
Beat your time. Do it!
Pull, pull!

727
00:46:27,117 --> 00:46:29,854
Come on. Pull.

728
00:46:29,887 --> 00:46:33,024
That's it, keep it up...

729
00:46:33,057 --> 00:46:35,827
OK, uh, new girl,
you can swim, can't you?

730
00:46:35,860 --> 00:46:37,595
Sweat Minor, Commander.

731
00:46:37,628 --> 00:46:41,132
I once swam from Perseus
to Pleiades in
a Class Five solar flare.

732
00:46:41,165 --> 00:46:42,333
[scoffs]

733
00:46:43,467 --> 00:46:45,336
OK... Go!

734
00:46:54,979 --> 00:46:56,214
Hey!

735
00:47:14,231 --> 00:47:16,968
Come on. You're OK.
You're OK. It's all right.

736
00:47:18,502 --> 00:47:22,640
I thought you said
you could swim?

737
00:47:18,502 --> 00:47:22,640
Yeah... in space.

738
00:47:22,673 --> 00:47:24,209
Welcome to Earth.

739
00:47:27,478 --> 00:47:30,448
I would've been OK, ya know.
You just never
gave me the chance.

740
00:47:39,056 --> 00:47:41,459
Hold it over the flame more,
it needs to be hotter.

741
00:47:48,465 --> 00:47:50,101
A little more.

742
00:47:58,409 --> 00:47:59,410
[screaming]

743
00:48:10,154 --> 00:48:12,390
I did exactly
what you said to do.

744
00:48:12,423 --> 00:48:14,893
I heated it
to 250 degrees Celsius.

745
00:48:16,293 --> 00:48:20,131
Down here we're still
using Fahrenheit.

746
00:48:20,164 --> 00:48:22,500
[Margie] So, you made it
twice as hot?

747
00:48:41,385 --> 00:48:43,387
One seventy-five, please.

748
00:48:43,420 --> 00:48:45,156
One-seventy-five what?

749
00:48:45,189 --> 00:48:47,525
Oh, money.
You must mean money.

750
00:48:49,259 --> 00:48:51,462
Where she comes from,
they don't have cash.

751
00:48:51,495 --> 00:48:55,166
Yeah, we just barter with moon
rocks and alien skulls.

752
00:48:55,199 --> 00:48:56,601
I'll pay you back.

753
00:48:56,634 --> 00:49:00,271
You know, the truth is,
I think it's pretty macro
you grew up in space.

754
00:49:00,304 --> 00:49:04,075
Yeah? Well, I think
it's "macro" you grew
up here on Earth.

755
00:49:04,108 --> 00:49:06,410
No, no, no. Go easy.
"Macro" is a good thing.

756
00:49:06,443 --> 00:49:10,214
"Micro" is bad.
"Viral" is nasty.

757
00:49:10,247 --> 00:49:12,283
"Graphic" is beautiful.

758
00:49:10,247 --> 00:49:12,283
Excuse me.

759
00:49:12,316 --> 00:49:15,987
But I studied my schedule
and nowhere on it does it say
anything

760
00:49:16,020 --> 00:49:18,222
about taking
a foreign language.

761
00:49:24,795 --> 00:49:27,064
"Forget about Wyndham,"
Nebula says.

762
00:49:27,097 --> 00:49:29,300
"Who cares if he's
up to something inky?"

763
00:49:29,333 --> 00:49:33,137
Do I listen?
Do I ever? Oh, no.

764
00:49:34,438 --> 00:49:37,041
You heard about
that concert in space?

765
00:49:34,438 --> 00:49:37,041
Yeah.

766
00:49:37,074 --> 00:49:39,377
One girl gets to dance
with Proto Zoa?

767
00:49:39,410 --> 00:49:43,280
Did anybody tell you that,
that lucky girl was supposed
to be me?

768
00:49:43,313 --> 00:49:46,183
No lie?
You won that contest?

769
00:49:46,216 --> 00:49:50,488
Uh-huh. But will
I be there for my
Glory Moment Major? Negative.

770
00:49:50,521 --> 00:49:54,291
I'll be here getting
blown up and drowned
in a torture chamber

771
00:49:54,324 --> 00:49:57,294
people call school because I
couldn't mind my own business.

772
00:49:57,327 --> 00:50:00,631
Would it make any difference
if there was some lesson you
could learn?

773
00:50:00,664 --> 00:50:03,801
Something about the dangers
of jumping to conclusions?

774
00:50:03,834 --> 00:50:06,404
No. Because I still fully
believe I was right!

775
00:50:06,437 --> 00:50:10,207
If you could have just seen
that look Lutz gave me before
I left them.

776
00:50:10,240 --> 00:50:14,412
OK then, would it make
any sense to go and discuss
this with Parker Wyndham?

777
00:50:14,445 --> 00:50:18,215
Cetus-Lupeedus, no!
Whatever's going on
up in that space-stay,

778
00:50:18,248 --> 00:50:21,385
he and Lutz
are in it together.
I can feel it.

779
00:50:21,418 --> 00:50:24,022
[Judy] Wait.
Why is my door open?

780
00:50:42,306 --> 00:50:44,642
Nothing like this
has happened to me before.

781
00:50:44,675 --> 00:50:46,277
I understand.

782
00:50:46,310 --> 00:50:49,146
Anyways, thank you
for everything, Officer.

783
00:50:49,179 --> 00:50:50,581
Uh-huh.

784
00:50:49,179 --> 00:50:50,581
I hope you find him.

785
00:50:50,614 --> 00:50:52,616
And lock the door
on your way out.

786
00:50:52,649 --> 00:50:54,652
You bet.

787
00:50:54,685 --> 00:50:57,288
Well, this place
is really turning out to be

788
00:50:57,321 --> 00:51:00,157
everything your mother
warned you about, isn't it?

789
00:51:00,190 --> 00:51:02,226
Not a lot of crime in space,
I'll bet.

790
00:51:02,259 --> 00:51:04,262
Nowhere for the bad guys
to run to.

791
00:51:06,296 --> 00:51:09,467
You know, the oddest thing is,
none of my stuff seems to be
missing.

792
00:51:09,500 --> 00:51:11,202
What about you?

793
00:51:11,235 --> 00:51:13,437
It's all here.

794
00:51:13,470 --> 00:51:15,873
I don't buy
this random break-in stuff.

795
00:51:15,906 --> 00:51:17,575
It was and Lutz and Wyndham.

796
00:51:17,608 --> 00:51:20,078
What would they
be looking for?

797
00:51:37,561 --> 00:51:39,097
[screams]

798
00:51:59,950 --> 00:52:02,620
So, guess you're surviving?

799
00:52:03,487 --> 00:52:04,622
Barely.

800
00:52:04,655 --> 00:52:07,358
Look, this is Difficult Major
for me,

801
00:52:07,391 --> 00:52:10,227
but I have this situation
I'm dealing with,

802
00:52:10,260 --> 00:52:12,363
and I could fully
use a little help.

803
00:52:12,396 --> 00:52:16,600
Last time I tried to help you,
I nearly got whiplash from the
verbal assault.

804
00:52:16,633 --> 00:52:21,372
Well, obviously, your life is
so lunarious you can't relate.

805
00:52:21,405 --> 00:52:24,142
But I was having
a very bad day.

806
00:52:25,375 --> 00:52:27,444
I'm sorry.

807
00:52:27,477 --> 00:52:30,414
Look, I'd like to help, but
I can't. I'm on my way out.

808
00:52:34,685 --> 00:52:37,454
I work at a stable.
You know, with horses.

809
00:52:37,487 --> 00:52:41,359
It's kind of cool.
Do you want to check it out?

810
00:52:42,793 --> 00:52:44,261
No, thanks.

811
00:52:44,294 --> 00:52:45,596
Suit yourself.

812
00:52:51,735 --> 00:52:53,571
Real horses?

813
00:52:59,843 --> 00:53:02,379
Does it always smell
like this around here?

814
00:53:02,412 --> 00:53:04,415
Yeah. It's great,
isn't it?

815
00:53:04,448 --> 00:53:06,517
That's not exactly the word
I would have picked.

816
00:53:09,720 --> 00:53:10,988
Cetus-Lupeedus!

817
00:53:11,021 --> 00:53:12,556
Pretty alpha, huh?

818
00:53:12,589 --> 00:53:14,525
Pretty... humongous.

819
00:53:15,792 --> 00:53:18,429
You're not scared of them,
are you?

820
00:53:18,462 --> 00:53:20,698
Me? No. Of course not.

821
00:53:20,731 --> 00:53:23,601
He's going to stay
in his little box, isn't he?

822
00:53:23,634 --> 00:53:25,703
Sure. Until I let him out.

823
00:53:25,736 --> 00:53:28,372
Out? Why would you want
to let him out?

824
00:53:28,405 --> 00:53:30,474
I thought
you weren't scared?

825
00:53:30,507 --> 00:53:36,280
I'm not. I just think he looks
very content where he is.

826
00:53:36,313 --> 00:53:40,218
This is Pogo. I'm going
to bring him out and brush him
now, all right?

827
00:53:56,867 --> 00:53:58,502
[whinnying]

828
00:54:04,641 --> 00:54:06,410
See how mellow he is?

829
00:54:09,646 --> 00:54:10,815
I think he likes you.

830
00:54:13,350 --> 00:54:14,552
Wanna give it a try?

831
00:54:20,757 --> 00:54:22,326
Not like that.

832
00:54:23,660 --> 00:54:24,862
Come on.

833
00:54:24,895 --> 00:54:26,631
Come on.

834
00:54:31,101 --> 00:54:32,603
Like this.

835
00:54:38,942 --> 00:54:40,778
It's not so scary,
is it?

836
00:54:45,882 --> 00:54:47,485
You want to ride him?

837
00:54:54,424 --> 00:54:56,794
Oh no. I can't do this.
Mistake Major.

838
00:54:56,827 --> 00:54:59,430
Just swing your leg over.
You'll be all right.

839
00:55:08,572 --> 00:55:10,407
I'm up. I did it!

840
00:55:10,440 --> 00:55:12,677
Cetus-Lupeedus,
it's so high.

841
00:55:13,577 --> 00:55:14,812
Ready?

842
00:55:14,845 --> 00:55:16,614
Go, Pogo.

843
00:55:35,565 --> 00:55:36,734
[laughing]

844
00:55:47,544 --> 00:55:49,780
I've never seen an ocean.

845
00:55:56,987 --> 00:55:58,922
It was so beautiful
out there.

846
00:55:58,955 --> 00:56:02,459
Yeah. So, your
Aunt Judy said it was
OK for you to go to dinner?

847
00:56:02,492 --> 00:56:03,794
Roger that.

848
00:56:03,827 --> 00:56:06,697
Now, riding a bike
is something you do
know how to do, right?

849
00:56:06,730 --> 00:56:10,668
Greg, practically our whole
space-stay gym is made up
of bikes.

850
00:56:13,503 --> 00:56:14,672
[crashing]

851
00:56:16,473 --> 00:56:20,644
Did I mention that
those were stationary bikes?

852
00:56:23,046 --> 00:56:25,916
[pop music plays]

853
00:56:27,484 --> 00:56:28,719
Stellar!

854
00:56:28,752 --> 00:56:31,989
A food that gives a whole new
meaning to the term "O-rings".

855
00:56:33,457 --> 00:56:36,894
Oh, hot, hot!
But good. So good.

856
00:56:36,927 --> 00:56:39,196
OK, what else can we order?

857
00:56:36,927 --> 00:56:39,196
Whoa.

858
00:56:39,229 --> 00:56:43,200
Slow down. I said I'd buy you
dinner, not 10 dinners.

859
00:56:43,233 --> 00:56:46,737
I know but
I can't stop. It all
tastes so fully illegal.

860
00:56:46,770 --> 00:56:50,674
Considering how many horses
I'm gonna have to groom
to pay for tonight,

861
00:56:50,707 --> 00:56:52,776
I'm glad to know
you're loving it.

862
00:56:52,809 --> 00:56:53,878
I am.

863
00:56:56,713 --> 00:57:01,518
See, in space we can only eat
what we can cultivate.

864
00:57:01,551 --> 00:57:05,656
Cows and little piggies
definitely don't make the cut.

865
00:57:05,689 --> 00:57:07,625
None of that bothers you?

866
00:57:08,592 --> 00:57:09,893
It's home, Greg.

867
00:57:09,926 --> 00:57:11,595
I've lived there
since I was a little kid.

868
00:57:12,896 --> 00:57:14,698
Cetus-Lupeedus!

869
00:57:12,896 --> 00:57:14,698
What?

870
00:57:16,800 --> 00:57:18,702
Lutz... where did he go?

871
00:57:18,735 --> 00:57:20,737
Who?

872
00:57:18,735 --> 00:57:20,737
Lutz, I said. I saw him.

873
00:57:20,770 --> 00:57:22,673
He was staring at me.

874
00:57:22,706 --> 00:57:24,975
The guy that works for
the WyndComm guy? You sure?

875
00:57:25,008 --> 00:57:27,878
Mondo-sure. Come on, Greg.
Time for Evasion Mode Major.

876
00:57:29,913 --> 00:57:30,981
Check!

877
00:57:35,886 --> 00:57:38,622
Oh! Could my legs
be any whiter?

878
00:57:38,655 --> 00:57:40,691
They like glow-in-the-dark.

879
00:57:41,791 --> 00:57:42,893
They're fine.

880
00:57:45,862 --> 00:57:47,664
Is it OK to...?

881
00:57:47,697 --> 00:57:49,600
Yeah. Sure. Go ahead.

882
00:57:51,001 --> 00:57:52,803
[gasps]

883
00:57:52,836 --> 00:57:54,538
It's freezing.

884
00:57:54,571 --> 00:57:56,874
Well, what did you expect?

885
00:57:54,571 --> 00:57:56,874
I don't know.

886
00:57:56,907 --> 00:58:02,480
Everything here is so...
different from what
I thought it would be.

887
00:58:05,615 --> 00:58:10,854
To me, your whole planet's
just one big Mystery Extreme.

888
00:58:10,887 --> 00:58:12,956
[electronic beeping]

889
00:58:12,989 --> 00:58:15,592
Speaking of mysteries,
from what I can see,

890
00:58:15,625 --> 00:58:18,896
the whole WyndComm operation's
not nearly as Midas as it used
to be.

891
00:58:18,929 --> 00:58:22,900
What did you uncover?

892
00:58:18,929 --> 00:58:22,900
Financial forms,
confidential memos.

893
00:58:22,933 --> 00:58:25,102
You hacked into
their internal data bank?

894
00:58:25,135 --> 00:58:27,538
Without breaking a sweat.

895
00:58:27,571 --> 00:58:28,672
Stellar!

896
00:58:31,575 --> 00:58:35,612
So, why would Wyndham promise
the space-stay more money

897
00:58:35,645 --> 00:58:38,015
if he didn't have it?

898
00:58:38,048 --> 00:58:41,552
That's the alpha question,
isn't it?

899
00:58:41,585 --> 00:58:44,588
All right, tell me again
the weird look Lutz gave you.

900
00:58:44,621 --> 00:58:46,023
We went through this already.

901
00:58:47,157 --> 00:58:48,892
OK. I put my luggage down

902
00:58:48,925 --> 00:58:51,962
and I told Wyndham that he
didn't fool me for a minute.

903
00:58:51,995 --> 00:58:55,132
Then I picked up my luggage
and I turned away.

904
00:58:55,165 --> 00:58:57,034
Were you wearing that?

905
00:58:57,067 --> 00:59:00,037
Aunt Judy bought me this.

906
00:58:57,067 --> 00:59:00,037
Not the shirt, the earring.

907
00:59:00,070 --> 00:59:02,639
Yeah.

908
00:59:00,070 --> 00:59:02,639
Well, maybe that's it!

909
00:59:02,672 --> 00:59:05,809
If Lutz was
acting generic until
you tucked back your hair,

910
00:59:05,842 --> 00:59:07,778
maybe he was reacting
to the disk.

911
00:59:07,811 --> 00:59:11,815
Cetus-Lupeedus!
Lutz had a disk!
In the Main Memory Bank.

912
00:59:11,848 --> 00:59:14,918
I don't know
if he put something
on it or took something off,

913
00:59:14,951 --> 00:59:16,687
but he definitely
had a disk.

914
00:59:21,191 --> 00:59:23,727
Will you quit wiggling?

915
00:59:21,191 --> 00:59:23,727
I can't help it.

916
00:59:23,760 --> 00:59:27,064
One more block and my butt's
gonna be ready for
the discard bin.

917
00:59:27,097 --> 00:59:28,566
[thunderclap]

918
00:59:33,970 --> 00:59:37,975
What's that? What's happening?

919
00:59:33,970 --> 00:59:37,975
Zenon, it's OK.
It's just rain.

920
00:59:39,042 --> 00:59:40,110
Rain?

921
00:59:42,045 --> 00:59:43,714
Rain.

922
00:59:44,180 --> 00:59:45,949
I remember this.

923
00:59:45,982 --> 00:59:50,120
When I was real little,
getting caught
in a summer storm.

924
00:59:55,859 --> 00:59:58,762
Wow, you don't
get out much, do you?

925
00:59:58,795 --> 01:00:00,097
Uh-uh.

926
01:00:02,732 --> 01:00:04,735
I had an alpha time tonight.

927
01:00:05,835 --> 01:00:07,671
Yeah. Me, too.

928
01:00:11,007 --> 01:00:13,744
I'd, uh, better get inside.

929
01:00:13,777 --> 01:00:17,681
Yeah. First thing tomorrow
morning, we gotta get over
to Andrew's

930
01:00:17,714 --> 01:00:21,118
to see if we can figure out
what's on this earring.

931
01:00:22,218 --> 01:00:23,854
See you there.

932
01:00:36,766 --> 01:00:37,935
Come here.

933
01:00:39,703 --> 01:00:42,139
You know what?
You've only
been here five days

934
01:00:42,172 --> 01:00:45,876
and already
you're having better luck
with guys than I ever have.

935
01:00:45,909 --> 01:00:49,046
[boy] I've never seen a disk
like this one.

936
01:00:49,079 --> 01:00:51,014
[groaning]

937
01:00:51,047 --> 01:00:52,916
Come on. Come on.

938
01:00:57,187 --> 01:01:00,691
Gregory, are you gonna
do this all day?

939
01:01:00,724 --> 01:01:01,992
Probably.

940
01:01:02,025 --> 01:01:04,094
But it's so boring!

941
01:01:04,127 --> 01:01:07,197
Don't you want
to go for a ride with me
in my dad's hover limo?

942
01:01:07,230 --> 01:01:08,799
No, thanks.

943
01:01:08,832 --> 01:01:10,801
You always used to like
riding with me,

944
01:01:10,834 --> 01:01:15,105
before she dropped out of the
sky like a ton of space junk.

945
01:01:18,041 --> 01:01:19,776
[boy] Reality pill, Margie.

946
01:01:19,809 --> 01:01:22,813
It was never you he liked,
it was the car.

947
01:01:22,846 --> 01:01:24,748
[Margie] Shut up, Matt.

948
01:01:26,316 --> 01:01:28,819
[Andrew] Why can't I
get into this thing?

949
01:01:28,852 --> 01:01:30,821
[Greg] You'll get it.
Keep trying.

950
01:01:35,258 --> 01:01:39,162
You know, a very close friend
of my father's works for IMC,

951
01:01:39,195 --> 01:01:41,231
and I was thinking,

952
01:01:41,264 --> 01:01:44,868
isn't it only fair to let them
know that their contest winner

953
01:01:44,901 --> 01:01:47,237
won't be around
for her big dance?

954
01:01:47,270 --> 01:01:50,107
I'm gonna be back
there in time.

955
01:01:50,140 --> 01:01:52,142
The concert
is next weekend, Zenon.

956
01:01:52,175 --> 01:01:56,046
Do you really think
your parents are gonna forgive
and forget that fast?

957
01:01:56,079 --> 01:01:59,082
I don't see
why this is your business.

958
01:01:56,079 --> 01:01:59,082
It's not.

959
01:01:59,115 --> 01:02:01,785
My business is keeping you
away from Gregory.

960
01:02:01,818 --> 01:02:04,888
He's helping me
with a Problem Major.

961
01:02:01,818 --> 01:02:04,888
That better be all.

962
01:02:04,921 --> 01:02:07,958
Or I'll sprint to that
view-phone and tell those
Microbe folks

963
01:02:07,991 --> 01:02:09,960
that they need
to pick a replacement.

964
01:02:09,993 --> 01:02:12,796
Because the girl they thought
was a winner is nothing

965
01:02:12,829 --> 01:02:16,800
but a stranded-on-Earth
Loser Extreme!

966
01:02:27,844 --> 01:02:30,914
[snoring]

967
01:02:27,844 --> 01:02:30,914
[electronic beeping]

968
01:02:36,019 --> 01:02:37,187
[beeping]

969
01:02:37,220 --> 01:02:38,922
What the heck?

970
01:02:43,159 --> 01:02:44,261
Ew!

971
01:02:53,303 --> 01:02:55,139
Oh, no. Hey!

972
01:02:57,073 --> 01:02:59,777
[electrical zapping]

973
01:02:57,073 --> 01:02:59,777
[gasping]

974
01:03:04,080 --> 01:03:06,583
Oh, come on. Come on.

975
01:03:06,616 --> 01:03:08,385
Oh, man!

976
01:03:10,153 --> 01:03:13,156
It's a highly sophisticated,
untraceable nano-virus

977
01:03:13,189 --> 01:03:16,126
that'll slowly continue
to replicate inside a system

978
01:03:16,159 --> 01:03:19,329
until the entire
hard drive crashes
down and self-destructs.

979
01:03:19,362 --> 01:03:21,598
Cetus-Lupeedus,
are you sure?

980
01:03:21,631 --> 01:03:25,602
Considering the hunk of melted
junk that now sits where my
computer used to be,

981
01:03:25,635 --> 01:03:28,905
I'm very sure.

982
01:03:28,938 --> 01:03:32,275
Fortunately,
after several hours
of highly-skilled maneuvers,

983
01:03:32,308 --> 01:03:35,846
I have managed to
refashion this program
into an "undo" file

984
01:03:35,879 --> 01:03:37,314
that should remove the bugs

985
01:03:37,347 --> 01:03:40,083
from whatever system
they've been introduced to.

986
01:03:40,116 --> 01:03:41,418
Can you guarantee that?

987
01:03:41,451 --> 01:03:44,221
Nothing can ever be guaranteed
until it's...

988
01:03:44,254 --> 01:03:46,056
...well, put to the test.

989
01:03:46,089 --> 01:03:50,060
Here. But to put it there,
we would have to get it there.

990
01:03:50,093 --> 01:03:51,928
That's a problem?

991
01:03:51,961 --> 01:03:55,198
She's talking about the Main
Computer on the space station.

992
01:03:55,231 --> 01:03:57,934
OK, if everything
you're saying is true, Andrew,

993
01:03:57,967 --> 01:04:00,136
how come it hasn't
come crashing down?

994
01:04:00,169 --> 01:04:03,473
The system your space
station has must
be incredibly powerful.

995
01:04:03,506 --> 01:04:06,142
So, you mean,
Wyndham's bugs might not work?

996
01:04:06,175 --> 01:04:08,378
Oh, no,
they'll work big time.

997
01:04:08,411 --> 01:04:10,380
They just might
take a little longer to do it.

998
01:04:12,415 --> 01:04:14,017
Let's go.

999
01:04:14,050 --> 01:04:17,020
Go? Go where?
School's about to start.

1000
01:04:17,053 --> 01:04:20,457
Not for me. My parents
are in Jeopardy Major!

1001
01:04:22,992 --> 01:04:24,294
You go.

1002
01:04:33,102 --> 01:04:35,372
I can't believe you think
I'm making this up!

1003
01:04:35,405 --> 01:04:39,476
I, more than anyone,
understand how
traumatic Earth can be.

1004
01:04:39,509 --> 01:04:42,946
But you haven't given yourself
time to adjust.

1005
01:04:42,979 --> 01:04:46,049
I still cannot regulate the
oxygen flow to the rat cages.

1006
01:04:46,082 --> 01:04:47,517
I can't seem
to find the glitch.

1007
01:04:47,550 --> 01:04:50,120
The entire experiment
is hinging on this.

1008
01:04:50,153 --> 01:04:51,421
I know. I know.

1009
01:04:50,153 --> 01:04:51,421
Mom!

1010
01:04:51,455 --> 01:04:54,991
This could be
a part of what
I'm trying to explain to you!

1011
01:04:55,024 --> 01:04:58,929
Zenon, tell your Aunt Judy to
stop letting you watch
so many movie chips.

1012
01:04:58,962 --> 01:05:01,698
Unless I get up there
to deliver the undo file
Andrew created,

1013
01:05:01,731 --> 01:05:05,302
the whole space-stay will be
blasted into some Universe
Minor!

1014
01:05:05,335 --> 01:05:06,503
Would you mind telling me

1015
01:05:06,536 --> 01:05:09,439
why Wyndham would want to
destroy his own space station?

1016
01:05:09,472 --> 01:05:13,076
For, for money? I don't know.
I only know he is!

1017
01:05:13,109 --> 01:05:17,013
You're still trying to make it
back for the Microbe concert,
right?

1018
01:05:17,046 --> 01:05:19,115
This isn't about Microbe,
Dad!

1019
01:05:19,148 --> 01:05:21,952
It isn't about having learned
a lesson down there!

1020
01:05:21,985 --> 01:05:26,022
[Mark] We know you're in
a new environment and it's
disorienting.

1021
01:05:26,055 --> 01:05:28,191
But why don't you make
the best of it?

1022
01:05:28,224 --> 01:05:31,194
Will you guys listen to me?
You're running out of time!

1023
01:05:31,227 --> 01:05:34,497
Besides the oxygen thing,
what other
systems are breaking down?

1024
01:05:34,530 --> 01:05:37,467
Nothing, Zenon.
It's business as usual.

1025
01:05:37,500 --> 01:05:40,036
By the way,
who is your friend?

1026
01:05:40,069 --> 01:05:43,473
[man] Commander Plank
needs you to meet him
in Lieutenant Orieux's office.

1027
01:05:43,506 --> 01:05:46,009
Zenon, honey, we gotta go.
Love you.

1028
01:05:46,042 --> 01:05:48,411
No, Mom, wait.

1029
01:05:46,042 --> 01:05:48,411
Yeah. Goodbye, sweetheart.

1030
01:05:48,444 --> 01:05:50,180
You stay out
of trouble, OK?

1031
01:05:50,213 --> 01:05:52,082
But...

1032
01:05:50,213 --> 01:05:52,082
[electronic beeping]

1033
01:05:55,785 --> 01:05:58,054
[Astrid] How could
she possibly know

1034
01:05:58,087 --> 01:06:00,757
that the system failures
are becoming more frequent?

1035
01:06:00,790 --> 01:06:03,493
There haven't been news leaks?

1036
01:06:00,790 --> 01:06:03,493
Not that I've heard.

1037
01:06:03,526 --> 01:06:05,328
But when Zenon's
on a mission,

1038
01:06:05,361 --> 01:06:08,331
we should never underestimate
what she's capable of.

1039
01:06:08,364 --> 01:06:10,433
[electrical buzzing]

1040
01:06:08,364 --> 01:06:10,433
[screaming]

1041
01:06:10,466 --> 01:06:12,068
Here we go again.

1042
01:06:12,101 --> 01:06:14,371
Why can't they figure out
what is wrong?

1043
01:06:17,407 --> 01:06:19,977
I'm sorry your parents
didn't believe you.

1044
01:06:21,210 --> 01:06:22,779
Yeah. Me, too.

1045
01:06:22,812 --> 01:06:26,616
You know, for a girl
who just got to this planet,

1046
01:06:26,649 --> 01:06:30,387
you're awfully hard
to get hold of.

1047
01:06:26,649 --> 01:06:30,387
You think that's an accident?

1048
01:06:30,420 --> 01:06:33,289
Chill, metro boy wonder.
I come in peace.

1049
01:06:33,322 --> 01:06:36,526
What do you want?

1050
01:06:33,322 --> 01:06:36,526
All I want is your earring.

1051
01:06:36,559 --> 01:06:38,261
It wouldn't look good
on you.

1052
01:06:38,294 --> 01:06:40,397
Do you know
what that disk contains?

1053
01:06:40,430 --> 01:06:44,034
It's just a bunch
of boring corporate records

1054
01:06:44,067 --> 01:06:47,370
that wouldn't mean anything
to you, but are valuable
to Mr. Wyndham.

1055
01:06:47,403 --> 01:06:49,272
Meaning...

1056
01:06:49,305 --> 01:06:53,343
...that you'll be in
Trouble Major
if you don't retrieve it?

1057
01:06:54,243 --> 01:06:56,312
As a matter of fact, yes.

1058
01:06:56,345 --> 01:06:59,182
What'll you give me for it?

1059
01:06:56,345 --> 01:06:59,182
What do you want, cash?

1060
01:06:59,215 --> 01:07:01,618
Nothing quite so tacky,
Mr. Lutz.

1061
01:07:01,651 --> 01:07:03,486
I'll be happy
with a ride home.

1062
01:07:03,519 --> 01:07:05,221
I thought you were home.

1063
01:07:05,254 --> 01:07:07,524
To the space station.

1064
01:07:05,254 --> 01:07:07,524
For crying out loud!

1065
01:07:07,557 --> 01:07:10,293
How am I supposed
to arrange that?

1066
01:07:07,557 --> 01:07:10,293
Ask your boss.

1067
01:07:10,326 --> 01:07:12,395
He's got a bunch
of shuttles.

1068
01:07:12,428 --> 01:07:15,632
I give you a lift
and you give me the disk?

1069
01:07:15,665 --> 01:07:18,268
Instantly.

1070
01:07:18,301 --> 01:07:21,438
All right. All right,
I promise I'll arrange it.

1071
01:07:22,338 --> 01:07:23,573
Wait!

1072
01:07:24,440 --> 01:07:26,643
Write it. Sign it.

1073
01:07:35,585 --> 01:07:37,054
Disk, please.

1074
01:07:38,388 --> 01:07:41,391
Hey, don't give
that to him 'til
you're boarding the flight.

1075
01:07:41,424 --> 01:07:43,660
Greg, show a little faith,
will ya?

1076
01:07:45,528 --> 01:07:50,300
Besides, we have to learn
to trust each other.
Right, Mr. Lutz?

1077
01:07:50,333 --> 01:07:53,303
Actually, wrong.
See, now, I've got the disk

1078
01:07:53,336 --> 01:07:57,340
and you have got... squat.

1079
01:08:13,456 --> 01:08:18,328
OK, so I get this unblocked,
you can call Nebula.

1080
01:08:18,361 --> 01:08:21,197
But what good will it do
if you gave the disk to Lutz?

1081
01:08:21,230 --> 01:08:22,732
You weren't listening,
Andrew.

1082
01:08:22,765 --> 01:08:25,235
I said I gave him
"a" disk.

1083
01:08:25,268 --> 01:08:28,905
But with my Skill Minor
but Ingenuity Major,

1084
01:08:28,938 --> 01:08:32,175
we can have as many rainbow
disks as we need.

1085
01:08:32,208 --> 01:08:33,310
All right!

1086
01:08:51,227 --> 01:08:55,198
[Wyndham] ...therefore, our
attendance at the Interglobal
Conference

1087
01:08:55,231 --> 01:08:57,600
on BioTechnic
Oceanic Harvesting

1088
01:08:57,633 --> 01:09:01,404
hinges upon your
acceptance and
support of the following...

1089
01:09:01,437 --> 01:09:04,374
Sir... could I, uh,
speak to you for a moment?

1090
01:09:04,407 --> 01:09:06,209
Very well.

1091
01:09:09,512 --> 01:09:12,415
It's not my fault, but...

1092
01:09:12,448 --> 01:09:14,651
[Wyndham shouting]
You lost the what?

1093
01:09:16,552 --> 01:09:18,655
Yes. It's working!
It's going through.

1094
01:09:18,688 --> 01:09:21,257
Andrew,
you're a miracle worker.

1095
01:09:21,290 --> 01:09:23,593
No applause.
Just, uh, send money.

1096
01:09:24,594 --> 01:09:26,796
Nebulator! Oh, it's me!

1097
01:09:26,829 --> 01:09:29,699
I've missed you so much!
Is everything OK up there?

1098
01:09:29,732 --> 01:09:32,602
You guys aren't having
global meltdowns yet, are you?

1099
01:09:32,635 --> 01:09:36,539
Cetus-Lupeedus! How did you
know? The attitude thrusters
are messed up.

1100
01:09:36,572 --> 01:09:39,309
The base has been
going through
these wild plunges.

1101
01:09:39,342 --> 01:09:40,777
It's been awful.

1102
01:09:39,342 --> 01:09:40,777
Oh, Neb!

1103
01:09:40,810 --> 01:09:42,478
Look at you.
You're alive.

1104
01:09:42,511 --> 01:09:44,681
Has it been gaseous?
Tell me all about it.

1105
01:09:44,714 --> 01:09:47,450
I'll tell you megabytes
when I see you.

1106
01:09:47,483 --> 01:09:50,620
But listen, everybody up there
is in danger mortis

1107
01:09:50,653 --> 01:09:53,289
and my parents are living
on Planet Denial.

1108
01:09:53,322 --> 01:09:56,693
I can't get into all the inky
details, but I was right
about Wyndham.

1109
01:09:56,726 --> 01:09:59,562
He put this
gunkball nano
virus in your computers.

1110
01:09:59,595 --> 01:10:02,765
We tried uploading
the undo disk from here,
but we can't.

1111
01:10:02,798 --> 01:10:04,567
The only way
I can possibly help

1112
01:10:04,600 --> 01:10:06,369
is to get up there
with the disk.

1113
01:10:06,402 --> 01:10:08,738
And to do that,
I need you.

1114
01:10:06,402 --> 01:10:08,738
What can I do?

1115
01:10:08,771 --> 01:10:11,274
Go to the shipping bay,
check the schedules

1116
01:10:11,307 --> 01:10:13,743
and let me know
when the next cargo ship
is set to go up.

1117
01:10:13,776 --> 01:10:15,545
That means
I have to break in.

1118
01:10:15,578 --> 01:10:17,580
So?

1119
01:10:15,578 --> 01:10:17,580
I'm not you, you know.

1120
01:10:17,613 --> 01:10:20,317
Sorry, Neb. For today
you're going to have to be.

1121
01:10:24,820 --> 01:10:26,623
You have a Videogram.

1122
01:10:32,428 --> 01:10:35,832
I hate to do this to you,
Aunt Jude, because you've been
Stellar Major,

1123
01:10:35,865 --> 01:10:37,734
but things have gotten
desperate.

1124
01:10:37,767 --> 01:10:41,337
It looks like I'm the only one
who can save my friends
and family.

1125
01:10:41,370 --> 01:10:44,707
Cryptic. But since Lutz
will most definitely
be back looking for me,

1126
01:10:44,740 --> 01:10:46,709
the less you know,
the better.

1127
01:10:46,742 --> 01:10:50,780
He's Viral-in-the-Extreme
and you do not want to tangle
with him, OK?

1128
01:10:50,813 --> 01:10:53,816
Now, I'll give you updates
the nano second
I possibly can.

1129
01:10:53,849 --> 01:10:56,753
Thanks for everything,
and I hope to see you soon.

1130
01:10:56,786 --> 01:11:00,590
Maybe you'll get brave
and come visit us in space.
Gotta go. Love you.

1131
01:11:00,623 --> 01:11:01,858
Bye.

1132
01:11:01,891 --> 01:11:05,528
Go? Go where?

1133
01:11:08,531 --> 01:11:11,501
[Leo] I still don't see
why you had to
wake me up for this.

1134
01:11:11,534 --> 01:11:13,369
This is an Emergency Major.

1135
01:11:13,402 --> 01:11:16,539
Your dad has the code pad,
and if I'm getting caught
down here,

1136
01:11:16,572 --> 01:11:18,508
I am not
getting busted alone.

1137
01:11:16,572 --> 01:11:18,508
OK!

1138
01:11:19,475 --> 01:11:22,679
Here it is.
Seven... one...

1139
01:11:23,446 --> 01:11:24,681
...five... four.

1140
01:11:28,751 --> 01:11:31,654
It's the cargo
shuttle schedule
we're looking for?

1141
01:11:31,687 --> 01:11:32,789
Yeah.

1142
01:11:34,623 --> 01:11:36,326
Look, here it is.

1143
01:11:37,693 --> 01:11:40,430
Whoa, talk about
your Karma Major.

1144
01:11:40,463 --> 01:11:41,631
Oh! Cetus-Lupeedus!

1145
01:11:41,664 --> 01:11:43,833
There's a ship set
to be launched tonight!

1146
01:11:43,866 --> 01:11:45,835
[machinery grinding]

1147
01:11:45,868 --> 01:11:47,837
What happened?

1148
01:11:47,870 --> 01:11:50,340
Something gaseous,
that's for sure.

1149
01:11:50,373 --> 01:11:53,509
Sounds like the entire station
shut down this time.

1150
01:11:53,542 --> 01:11:54,711
[groaning]

1151
01:11:55,711 --> 01:11:58,481
[electronic blast noises]

1152
01:11:58,514 --> 01:12:00,550
[chuckling] All right!

1153
01:12:09,492 --> 01:12:12,662
You know,
when you're up there,

1154
01:12:12,695 --> 01:12:16,532
the sky never seems
quite this massive.

1155
01:12:16,565 --> 01:12:19,569
[Zenon] Isn't it weird
to think they're all up there?

1156
01:12:19,602 --> 01:12:23,740
I mean, my parents and
my friends, they're all
in Danger Mortis, Greg,

1157
01:12:23,773 --> 01:12:25,575
and they don't even know it.

1158
01:12:25,608 --> 01:12:28,711
They're gonna be all right.
I know it.

1159
01:12:28,744 --> 01:12:30,847
Then why hasn't Nebula
called back?

1160
01:12:30,880 --> 01:12:32,982
Three hours
we've been stuck in here, Leo.

1161
01:12:33,015 --> 01:12:35,651
Shouldn't the back-up
generators be kicking in?

1162
01:12:35,684 --> 01:12:37,854
Why don't these doors
have manual overrides?

1163
01:12:37,887 --> 01:12:40,590
How should I know?
Am I Plank-the-Blank?

1164
01:12:40,623 --> 01:12:41,958
[machinery whirring]

1165
01:12:43,459 --> 01:12:44,594
Listen.

1166
01:12:47,897 --> 01:12:49,832
Supernova!

1167
01:12:49,865 --> 01:12:52,602
[Greg] I don't know
if you want to hear this,

1168
01:12:52,635 --> 01:12:56,773
but if you leave now,
I'm really gonna miss you.

1169
01:12:57,773 --> 01:12:59,609
Really?

1170
01:12:57,773 --> 01:12:59,609
Yeah.

1171
01:13:00,910 --> 01:13:03,713
You're not like girls
around here.

1172
01:13:03,746 --> 01:13:07,817
You're... I don't know...
Alpha Extreme.

1173
01:13:15,558 --> 01:13:16,893
Cetus-Lupeedus, Greg.

1174
01:13:16,926 --> 01:13:18,795
If you want to kiss me,
just do it.

1175
01:13:21,897 --> 01:13:22,965
Ow!

1176
01:13:22,998 --> 01:13:24,701
I'm... I'm sorry.

1177
01:13:28,604 --> 01:13:30,006
Dare to try again?

1178
01:13:33,676 --> 01:13:35,545
[electronic beeping]

1179
01:13:36,912 --> 01:13:38,815
Zee, you have to leave now!

1180
01:13:38,848 --> 01:13:41,851
A cargo ship's being launched
from WyndComm in less than an
hour!

1181
01:13:41,884 --> 01:13:43,886
Come on, Greg.

1182
01:13:43,919 --> 01:13:46,556
[Andrew] Quiet.
Shh, don't wake my parents.

1183
01:13:46,589 --> 01:13:49,058
[Zenon] How do we drive?

1184
01:13:46,589 --> 01:13:49,058
It's got an auto pilot.

1185
01:13:49,091 --> 01:13:50,927
It practically drives itself.

1186
01:13:50,960 --> 01:13:53,630
Man, this car's heavy.

1187
01:13:50,960 --> 01:13:53,630
Push.

1188
01:14:02,004 --> 01:14:03,172
Hello!

1189
01:14:03,205 --> 01:14:06,476
I could have sworn I told you
to stay away from Gregory.

1190
01:14:06,509 --> 01:14:10,847
Margie, I'm dealing with
a Crisis Major, and Greg
is a big boy.

1191
01:14:10,880 --> 01:14:13,916
Who's here to tell you to stop
being a halftone, all right?

1192
01:14:13,949 --> 01:14:16,552
I'm not your boyfriend.

1193
01:14:13,949 --> 01:14:16,552
Not since she arrived.

1194
01:14:16,585 --> 01:14:18,855
Not ever. I never was.
I never will be.

1195
01:14:18,888 --> 01:14:22,525
Swallow the reality pill,
read my flapping lips.

1196
01:14:22,558 --> 01:14:26,562
OK, Zenon or no Zenon,
I will never be
your boyfriend!

1197
01:14:26,595 --> 01:14:29,832
Is this negotiable? Maybe
I caught you at a bad time.

1198
01:14:29,865 --> 01:14:32,001
I could come back tomorrow.

1199
01:14:32,034 --> 01:14:34,704
Hey! In case you people
are blanking here,

1200
01:14:34,737 --> 01:14:38,007
Zenon's got a short amount
of time to talk her way
onto that shuttle.

1201
01:14:38,040 --> 01:14:40,743
You're leaving us?

1202
01:14:38,040 --> 01:14:40,743
Sorry to break your heart,

1203
01:14:40,776 --> 01:14:44,013
but the space-stay needs me.

1204
01:14:40,776 --> 01:14:44,013
In that case, pop the trunk.

1205
01:14:44,046 --> 01:14:46,816
I have to come along
and say good-bye.

1206
01:14:49,685 --> 01:14:51,988
So, you do know how
to pilot this thing?

1207
01:14:52,021 --> 01:14:54,590
As long as you've got
the ignition code

1208
01:14:54,623 --> 01:14:57,126
and enter departure
and destination points...

1209
01:14:57,159 --> 01:15:00,730
Supposedly my dad keeps
this puppy programmed
to do all the rest.

1210
01:15:00,763 --> 01:15:02,966
[nervous laugh]
Supposedly?

1211
01:15:13,142 --> 01:15:14,877
[Andrew]
There! There it is!

1212
01:15:14,910 --> 01:15:17,013
[Zenon] Wait!
Come back, please!

1213
01:15:17,046 --> 01:15:18,981
Look over here!

1214
01:15:17,046 --> 01:15:18,981
[beeping horn]

1215
01:15:19,014 --> 01:15:22,785
Wait! Come back!
Please don't go without me.

1216
01:15:22,818 --> 01:15:24,587
No! Come back!

1217
01:15:31,760 --> 01:15:33,730
And there it goes.

1218
01:15:36,699 --> 01:15:39,735
What now?

1219
01:15:36,699 --> 01:15:39,735
I think we ought
to go to the cops.

1220
01:15:39,768 --> 01:15:41,704
Yeah, right.

1221
01:15:41,737 --> 01:15:44,874
My own parents
didn't believe me.
Why should they?

1222
01:15:46,642 --> 01:15:48,611
It's over.

1223
01:15:48,644 --> 01:15:51,614
Wyndham's nano-virus will chew
through all the systems,

1224
01:15:51,647 --> 01:15:55,051
everybody up there
will be finished.

1225
01:15:59,088 --> 01:16:02,124
It's really awful.

1226
01:16:02,157 --> 01:16:06,929
But wouldn't it be viral
if the explosion happens
while Microbe's there?

1227
01:16:06,962 --> 01:16:08,030
What did you say?

1228
01:16:08,063 --> 01:16:10,867
I wasn't trying to be cruel.

1229
01:16:12,635 --> 01:16:14,937
Margie, Margie, Margie!

1230
01:16:14,970 --> 01:16:18,674
Are you feeling all right?

1231
01:16:14,970 --> 01:16:18,674
Margie, you are a Mega-Genius.

1232
01:16:18,707 --> 01:16:20,109
I know. Why?

1233
01:16:20,976 --> 01:16:22,945
Well... Microbe.

1234
01:16:22,978 --> 01:16:26,215
They've got to be heading up
to the space-stay
for their concert.

1235
01:16:26,248 --> 01:16:28,618
Right?

1236
01:16:28,651 --> 01:16:29,952
Right.

1237
01:16:29,985 --> 01:16:32,688
[man on TV] Rock and roll fans
around the world...

1238
01:16:32,721 --> 01:16:35,057
It's not that
I've lost track of her,
Astrid.

1239
01:16:35,090 --> 01:16:36,993
It is just that...

1240
01:16:37,026 --> 01:16:39,762
...I have no idea
where she is, exactly. Oh!

1241
01:16:39,795 --> 01:16:43,232
...with an update, here's
Jillian live from WyndComm
headquarters.

1242
01:16:43,265 --> 01:16:45,701
Dozens of people,
and diehard rock fans,

1243
01:16:45,734 --> 01:16:48,971
have gathered in anticipation
of today's launch of the
shuttle

1244
01:16:49,004 --> 01:16:51,207
that will be
transporting Microbe...

1245
01:16:49,004 --> 01:16:51,207
[gasps]

1246
01:16:51,240 --> 01:16:53,109
...making them
the first rock band...

1247
01:17:00,816 --> 01:17:04,887
Hello, pal. I'm sure we're not
on your list or anything,

1248
01:17:04,920 --> 01:17:06,889
but this is Zenon Kar.

1249
01:17:06,922 --> 01:17:08,958
You know, the Microbe contest
winner.

1250
01:17:08,991 --> 01:17:13,229
And it's alpha-vital that
she speak to Proto Zoa ASAP.

1251
01:17:13,262 --> 01:17:14,897
Did you say Zenon Kar?

1252
01:17:14,930 --> 01:17:17,900
That's me all right.
Guess you've heard of me, huh?

1253
01:17:17,933 --> 01:17:21,203
Step out of the vehicle.
I've got instructions
to detain you.

1254
01:17:21,236 --> 01:17:23,072
You mean, like
take her prisoner?

1255
01:17:23,105 --> 01:17:25,174
Mr. Wyndham is anxious
to get hold of you.

1256
01:17:25,207 --> 01:17:26,942
I'll bet he is.

1257
01:17:26,975 --> 01:17:29,779
Sorry. Love to hang around,
but gotta rocket.

1258
01:17:33,182 --> 01:17:34,484
Hey! Hey!

1259
01:17:34,517 --> 01:17:38,287
I came up with the concept
for the first rock concert
in space

1260
01:17:38,320 --> 01:17:42,958
as a way of saying thank you
to the crew of my
WyndComm Space Station.

1261
01:17:42,991 --> 01:17:45,461
Look! There it is!

1262
01:17:42,991 --> 01:17:45,461
Being a visionary...

1263
01:17:45,494 --> 01:17:47,830
[Andrew] Microbe's gotta
be back stage.

1264
01:17:47,863 --> 01:17:50,800
...it's a burden
I'm willing to carry.

1265
01:17:47,863 --> 01:17:50,800
I'm going in.

1266
01:17:50,833 --> 01:17:52,268
[applause]

1267
01:17:59,141 --> 01:18:02,078
And being visionary
is what WyndComm Enterprises

1268
01:18:02,111 --> 01:18:03,779
has always been about.

1269
01:18:03,812 --> 01:18:06,782
That's how the WyndComm Space
Station came into being.

1270
01:18:06,815 --> 01:18:08,317
Ladies and gentlemen,
at this time

1271
01:18:08,350 --> 01:18:10,953
I'd like to introduce
to you two of the people

1272
01:18:10,986 --> 01:18:14,290
that are responsible for the
concepts, design and execution

1273
01:18:14,323 --> 01:18:17,293
of the world's first
commercial space station.

1274
01:18:17,326 --> 01:18:20,796
Our conceptual engineer
and project manager,

1275
01:18:20,829 --> 01:18:22,832
without whose exceptional
talent...

1276
01:18:23,332 --> 01:18:25,101
Cheers.

1277
01:18:26,869 --> 01:18:29,172
Do you believe
we're going into outer space?

1278
01:18:31,240 --> 01:18:33,075
Mr. Zoa?

1279
01:18:33,108 --> 01:18:37,980
It's me, Zenon Kar,
your contest winner.

1280
01:18:38,013 --> 01:18:42,818
I'm here instead of up there,
but you have to take me
back up there with you.

1281
01:18:42,851 --> 01:18:45,988
I don't have a lot of time
to explain,
but it's Urgent Major.

1282
01:18:46,021 --> 01:18:48,858
You have to believe me.
You're my one and only hope.

1283
01:18:48,891 --> 01:18:52,294
It is you, isn't it?

1284
01:18:48,891 --> 01:18:52,294
Got you now, kid. Game over.

1285
01:18:52,327 --> 01:18:54,964
Sorry about this.
We'll get her out of here.

1286
01:18:54,997 --> 01:18:57,299
No! No, tell them!
You have to tell them!

1287
01:18:57,332 --> 01:19:00,336
It's urgent in
the Viral Extreme.

1288
01:18:57,332 --> 01:19:00,336
[guard] Let's go.

1289
01:19:00,369 --> 01:19:03,873
Gentlemen, you obviously
don't know who this is.

1290
01:19:03,906 --> 01:19:06,275
We have orders
to deliver her to Mr. Wyndham.

1291
01:19:06,308 --> 01:19:09,044
And disappoint
all my adoring
disc-buying fans

1292
01:19:09,077 --> 01:19:12,181
who are waiting
to see me dance with her
up there in space?

1293
01:19:12,214 --> 01:19:14,884
I don't think so, boys.

1294
01:19:14,917 --> 01:19:17,853
Lacy, would you do me a favor,
darling?

1295
01:19:17,886 --> 01:19:20,956
Please escort Ms. Kar
to the space shuttle.

1296
01:19:20,989 --> 01:19:23,325
I'm going?
You're taking me with you?

1297
01:19:20,989 --> 01:19:23,325
Yes.

1298
01:19:23,358 --> 01:19:27,997
Cetus-Lupeedus! As much
as I loved you before,
now I love you even more!

1299
01:19:28,030 --> 01:19:30,032
Of course you do.

1300
01:19:30,065 --> 01:19:31,867
Thank you,
thank you, thank you!

1301
01:19:31,900 --> 01:19:34,237
Mr. Zoa, this is
strictly against regulations.

1302
01:19:36,271 --> 01:19:39,175
But, Mr. Zoa, this...

1303
01:19:36,271 --> 01:19:39,175
[crowd applauding]

1304
01:19:39,208 --> 01:19:45,247
Boys, are you going to be
Wyndham's monkeys
for the rest of your lives,

1305
01:19:45,280 --> 01:19:48,918
or might you consider
a career in rock and roll?

1306
01:19:51,153 --> 01:19:54,390
Rock and roll!

1307
01:19:51,153 --> 01:19:54,390
All right, then. Here you go.

1308
01:19:54,423 --> 01:20:00,162
Without further ado, let me
introduce the group who,
to my way of thinking,

1309
01:20:00,195 --> 01:20:02,131
has always been
out of this world.

1310
01:20:02,164 --> 01:20:04,366
Ladies and gentlemen,
Microbe!

1311
01:20:04,399 --> 01:20:06,235
[crowd screaming]

1312
01:20:18,647 --> 01:20:21,984
[Zoa] Calm down, calm down.

1313
01:20:22,017 --> 01:20:24,119
You know I love ya.
It's good to see ya.

1314
01:20:24,152 --> 01:20:28,224
So, uh, today's journey
is one small step for Microbe,

1315
01:20:28,257 --> 01:20:32,261
and one giant leap
for rock and roll!

1316
01:20:28,257 --> 01:20:32,261
[cheering]

1317
01:20:41,203 --> 01:20:43,072
Sir, excuse me. Hello.

1318
01:20:43,105 --> 01:20:45,875
I'm looking for my niece,
Zenon Kar.

1319
01:20:45,908 --> 01:20:47,977
You and everyone else
around here.

1320
01:20:48,010 --> 01:20:51,080
She's here?

1321
01:20:48,010 --> 01:20:51,080
Who do you think
wrecked my gate?

1322
01:20:51,113 --> 01:20:54,183
Sorry about that,
but I gotta go.

1323
01:20:51,113 --> 01:20:54,183
Hey! Hey! Hey!

1324
01:20:54,216 --> 01:20:55,852
[cheering]

1325
01:21:00,122 --> 01:21:04,360
This really was inspired,
sending such a popular group
up to the space station

1326
01:21:04,393 --> 01:21:06,962
hours before
it's going to self-destruct.

1327
01:21:06,995 --> 01:21:08,364
What a perfect smoke screen

1328
01:21:08,397 --> 01:21:11,033
to keep fingers
from ever being
pointed at you.

1329
01:21:11,066 --> 01:21:15,037
Yes. If only you hadn't
allowed that little brat
to steal our disk.

1330
01:21:15,070 --> 01:21:17,239
Where is she?
What have you done with her?

1331
01:21:17,272 --> 01:21:19,975
Who is this woman?

1332
01:21:17,272 --> 01:21:19,975
I am Zenon Kar's aunt.

1333
01:21:20,008 --> 01:21:22,244
And I demand to know
where she is.

1334
01:21:22,277 --> 01:21:24,113
I can assure you
she isn't here.

1335
01:21:24,146 --> 01:21:26,482
Well, that's not
what the guy at the gate said.

1336
01:21:26,515 --> 01:21:28,417
The guy at the gate
was mistaken.

1337
01:21:28,450 --> 01:21:32,922
I am Parker Wyndham,
and nothing goes on here
that I don't know about.

1338
01:21:32,955 --> 01:21:35,691
She's here.
She's determined to get back

1339
01:21:35,724 --> 01:21:37,359
to the space station
with Proto Zoa.

1340
01:21:37,392 --> 01:21:39,428
Find him and you'll
certainly find her.

1341
01:21:42,164 --> 01:21:43,232
Oh, no.

1342
01:21:43,265 --> 01:21:44,433
[cheering]

1343
01:21:49,137 --> 01:21:51,107
You don't suppose she...

1344
01:21:52,574 --> 01:21:54,176
Wait!

1345
01:21:54,209 --> 01:21:56,211
Everyone strapped in?

1346
01:21:56,244 --> 01:21:59,415
Make sure those seat belts
are securely fastened.

1347
01:21:59,448 --> 01:22:01,918
Stand clear for shuttle
lift-off.

1348
01:22:03,151 --> 01:22:05,020
That shuttle's
not going anyplace.

1349
01:22:05,053 --> 01:22:07,022
Zenon,
I'm responsible for you!

1350
01:22:07,055 --> 01:22:08,457
We're ready for lift-off.

1351
01:22:20,502 --> 01:22:22,204
Ooh! Whoa!

1352
01:22:22,237 --> 01:22:24,740
[alarm buzzes]

1353
01:22:22,237 --> 01:22:24,740
Ahh!

1354
01:22:24,773 --> 01:22:26,509
[grunting]

1355
01:22:32,314 --> 01:22:34,951
[giggling]

1356
01:22:40,422 --> 01:22:42,992
[buzzing]

1357
01:22:40,422 --> 01:22:42,992
No!

1358
01:22:48,797 --> 01:22:52,568
We're headed for outer space,
right? I mean, I'm going
to outer space?

1359
01:22:52,601 --> 01:22:56,038
Yeah, right.
Listen, Aunt Judy?

1360
01:22:52,601 --> 01:22:56,038
Yes.

1361
01:22:56,071 --> 01:22:59,041
There's some stuff
that I should fill you in on.

1362
01:22:59,074 --> 01:23:01,610
[voice on intercom,
indistinct]

1363
01:23:01,643 --> 01:23:04,279
The cooling and
the heating systems are down.

1364
01:23:04,312 --> 01:23:07,549
The living module is freezing,
the tech module is sweltering.

1365
01:23:07,582 --> 01:23:10,019
Well, at least
it's bearable in here.

1366
01:23:10,052 --> 01:23:11,187
For the moment.

1367
01:23:11,220 --> 01:23:14,089
The entire habitat wing
lost power about an hour ago.

1368
01:23:14,122 --> 01:23:17,493
Right about the time the
attitude thrusters started
acting up.

1369
01:23:17,526 --> 01:23:19,328
[alarm sounding]

1370
01:23:20,395 --> 01:23:22,297
Why is this happening?

1371
01:23:22,330 --> 01:23:25,034
As if there isn't
enough going on, sir,

1372
01:23:25,067 --> 01:23:28,537
the shuttle carrying Microbe
will be arriving within the
hour.

1373
01:23:28,570 --> 01:23:31,640
The whole world has to be
turning its eyes on us now?

1374
01:23:31,673 --> 01:23:36,078
Sorry, sir.
We're doing the best we can
to keep things going.

1375
01:23:36,111 --> 01:23:39,114
Well, wave them off. At least
they can save themselves.

1376
01:23:39,147 --> 01:23:41,250
Without refueling
they'll never get home.

1377
01:23:43,418 --> 01:23:46,589
If we get to total system
failure, none of us will.

1378
01:23:57,866 --> 01:24:00,636
Good thing that you can sing
better than
you can play poker.

1379
01:24:00,669 --> 01:24:03,272
Cheeky little scamp,
isn't she?

1380
01:24:03,305 --> 01:24:05,674
Mm-hmm.

1381
01:24:05,707 --> 01:24:08,343
Um, there is one thing
I should mention.

1382
01:24:08,376 --> 01:24:11,547
There's this little situation
happening on the space-stay

1383
01:24:11,580 --> 01:24:13,549
I need to take care of
when we get home.

1384
01:24:13,582 --> 01:24:15,651
You'll fully love
being up there

1385
01:24:15,684 --> 01:24:17,419
and I've got everything
under control.

1386
01:24:17,452 --> 01:24:19,288
We can only hope.

1387
01:24:19,321 --> 01:24:21,123
Breathe, Aunt Judy.
Breathe slowly.

1388
01:24:21,156 --> 01:24:22,458
OK, I'm breathing.

1389
01:24:23,258 --> 01:24:24,626
I hate flying.

1390
01:24:24,659 --> 01:24:26,195
Again?

1391
01:24:27,596 --> 01:24:31,266
[Wyndham] A toothpick
is never going to work.
You have a laser knife?

1392
01:24:31,299 --> 01:24:32,500
[Lutz] What am I,
a Boy Scout?

1393
01:24:32,534 --> 01:24:35,637
[Wyndham] You are an utterly
useless, over-paid, spineless,

1394
01:24:35,670 --> 01:24:37,473
incompetent,
jabbering fool!

1395
01:24:43,745 --> 01:24:47,316
[computer voice] Confirm hard
dock on shuttle in Bay 3.

1396
01:24:54,456 --> 01:24:57,292
Welcome to WyndComm Space
Station. I'm Lt. Schiff.

1397
01:24:57,325 --> 01:24:59,528
Proto Zoa,
pleased to meet you.

1398
01:24:59,561 --> 01:25:02,564
[man on intercom] Zero-G
technician to the bridge,
on the double.

1399
01:25:02,597 --> 01:25:04,666
[screaming]

1400
01:25:04,699 --> 01:25:07,269
[alarm sounding]

1401
01:25:10,372 --> 01:25:13,509
We're currently experiencing
a few technical glitches.

1402
01:25:13,542 --> 01:25:15,344
Nothing to be alarmed about.

1403
01:25:17,746 --> 01:25:19,482
Right this way.

1404
01:25:25,387 --> 01:25:28,557
Zero-G technician
to the bridge on the double.

1405
01:25:28,590 --> 01:25:30,626
We're floating up here.

1406
01:25:28,590 --> 01:25:30,626
Hi.

1407
01:25:33,762 --> 01:25:35,631
Come on, Aunt Judy.

1408
01:25:37,432 --> 01:25:40,769
Trust me. Turn off all
non-essential systems!
Give me more...

1409
01:25:40,802 --> 01:25:42,371
[grunting]

1410
01:25:40,802 --> 01:25:42,371
Sir!

1411
01:25:42,404 --> 01:25:44,506
What are you...
How did you get back?

1412
01:25:44,539 --> 01:25:48,243
Commander, Wyndham and Lutz
are trying to bring down
the space-stay!

1413
01:25:48,276 --> 01:25:50,245
I'm the only one
who can stop them.

1414
01:25:50,278 --> 01:25:53,649
As hard as it may be
to believe,
she's telling you the truth.

1415
01:25:55,283 --> 01:25:57,186
Who are you?

1416
01:25:57,219 --> 01:26:00,189
Judy Kling.
I'm Zenon's aunt.

1417
01:26:00,222 --> 01:26:01,657
Edward Plank.

1418
01:26:01,690 --> 01:26:03,159
[screaming]

1419
01:26:06,494 --> 01:26:08,397
[pounding]

1420
01:26:11,333 --> 01:26:15,237
Pilot, turn this
shuttle around immediately,
and get us out of here.

1421
01:26:15,270 --> 01:26:18,207
We can't. We have to refuel
and cool the booster cells.

1422
01:26:18,240 --> 01:26:20,475
No, we don't!
We have to leave right now!

1423
01:26:20,508 --> 01:26:24,313
I'm sorry, sir, but there...

1424
01:26:20,508 --> 01:26:24,313
No excuses! Just do it!

1425
01:26:26,314 --> 01:26:28,550
Even if your credibility
wasn't shaky,

1426
01:26:28,583 --> 01:26:30,552
nothing you're telling me
makes sense.

1427
01:26:30,585 --> 01:26:33,488
Because she's the one
who tampered
with your systems.

1428
01:26:33,521 --> 01:26:36,325
And she's trying
to cover it up
by blaming me!

1429
01:26:36,358 --> 01:26:38,460
He's a liar!
A mondo liar!

1430
01:26:38,493 --> 01:26:41,563
I'm not going to engage
in a name-calling contest
with a teenager.

1431
01:26:41,596 --> 01:26:43,532
Because you know
you'll lose!

1432
01:26:43,565 --> 01:26:46,802
The computer's gone flatline.
We've got less
than 15 minutes.

1433
01:26:46,835 --> 01:26:50,439
That's what
I'm trying to tell you.
It's all because of him!

1434
01:26:50,472 --> 01:26:53,308
If you allow this child
to speak to me in this manner,

1435
01:26:53,341 --> 01:26:55,711
I will have
this entire station
shut down!

1436
01:26:55,744 --> 01:26:59,548
Oh, button your lip!

1437
01:26:55,744 --> 01:26:59,548
Look! I have no time
for bickering!

1438
01:26:59,581 --> 01:27:03,285
Take Zenon and her aunt
to my office.

1439
01:26:59,581 --> 01:27:03,285
No! Wait! Please.

1440
01:27:03,318 --> 01:27:05,687
If you and Mr. Lutz will relax
in my V.I.P. lounge,

1441
01:27:05,720 --> 01:27:09,291
we'll sort this out
after I get the space station
under control.

1442
01:27:09,324 --> 01:27:12,694
Commander, I need
emergency re-fueling.
I have to leave immediately.

1443
01:27:12,727 --> 01:27:14,596
I bet you do!

1444
01:27:12,727 --> 01:27:14,596
That's enough! Go!

1445
01:27:14,629 --> 01:27:16,431
[Zenon screaming]

1446
01:27:16,464 --> 01:27:18,533
Gentlemen, please.

1447
01:27:18,566 --> 01:27:20,302
Find the disk!

1448
01:27:21,503 --> 01:27:23,338
I'm trying
to find the disk.

1449
01:27:23,371 --> 01:27:25,741
[computer voice]
Keep all hatches closed.

1450
01:27:27,609 --> 01:27:31,446
700 channels and I can't get
one report on what's going on
in space.

1451
01:27:31,479 --> 01:27:33,515
You can't talk
to Zenon directly?

1452
01:27:35,617 --> 01:27:38,620
I can't believe it.
What's going on up there?
You guys OK?

1453
01:27:38,653 --> 01:27:42,658
Emergency Major.
Where's Andrew?

1454
01:27:38,653 --> 01:27:42,658
What's the static?

1455
01:27:42,691 --> 01:27:46,628
You unblocked my communicator
for calls between
Earth and the space-stay.

1456
01:27:46,661 --> 01:27:48,464
But now I can't
get it to make local calls.

1457
01:27:49,397 --> 01:27:50,632
Where are you?

1458
01:27:50,665 --> 01:27:54,303
In more trouble than I've got
time to explain. Call Nebula.

1459
01:27:54,336 --> 01:27:57,506
Tell her Aunt Judy and I are
being held captive in Plank's
office,

1460
01:27:57,539 --> 01:27:59,408
and she has to come
and get us out.

1461
01:27:59,441 --> 01:28:01,543
You just got there
and you're in detention?

1462
01:28:01,576 --> 01:28:02,845
Call Nebula!

1463
01:28:07,482 --> 01:28:10,619
Code Red! Emergency conditions
on all levels.

1464
01:28:10,652 --> 01:28:14,390
Code red. Emergency conditions
on all levels.

1465
01:28:18,126 --> 01:28:20,862
Just my luck. The one room
in the whole space-stay

1466
01:28:20,895 --> 01:28:23,765
where the ceiling tiles
don't come loose.

1467
01:28:23,798 --> 01:28:27,836
That's why we went
to "Plan B".

1468
01:28:23,798 --> 01:28:27,836
That's my girl!

1469
01:28:27,869 --> 01:28:29,871
Code red. Emergency
conditions...

1470
01:28:29,904 --> 01:28:32,574
Neb, try to find my parents
and fill them in.

1471
01:28:32,607 --> 01:28:35,711
I've got to try and undo
what Wyndham and Lutz did.

1472
01:28:35,744 --> 01:28:36,912
All right. Bye.

1473
01:28:35,744 --> 01:28:36,912
Bye.

1474
01:28:36,945 --> 01:28:38,613
What about those scary guys?

1475
01:28:38,646 --> 01:28:41,416
Aren't you afraid
they're gonna try
to get out of here?

1476
01:28:41,449 --> 01:28:44,553
Sweat Minor, Aunt Judy.
I've already taken care of it.

1477
01:28:44,586 --> 01:28:47,656
Continue evacuation
of section 11 on level four.

1478
01:28:49,391 --> 01:28:51,593
Activating ignition sequence.

1479
01:28:53,561 --> 01:28:55,630
Go! Go!

1480
01:28:55,663 --> 01:28:56,865
[engine running]

1481
01:28:57,866 --> 01:29:00,936
[engine stopping]

1482
01:29:00,969 --> 01:29:04,773
Oh, this was
a great plan, sir.
A great plan.

1483
01:29:04,806 --> 01:29:07,609
Only one small hitch,
I might point out.

1484
01:29:07,642 --> 01:29:10,346
We weren't supposed
to be on board when
it self-destructed.

1485
01:29:12,480 --> 01:29:15,150
Incorrect access code.

1486
01:29:12,480 --> 01:29:15,150
The virus originated here.

1487
01:29:15,183 --> 01:29:17,452
We can't figure out
what to do to stop it.

1488
01:29:17,485 --> 01:29:19,788
Total system failure
in 30 seconds.

1489
01:29:20,655 --> 01:29:22,157
Thirty seconds?

1490
01:29:22,190 --> 01:29:24,626
This was supposed
to be the safe place to live.

1491
01:29:25,460 --> 01:29:26,862
Any last thoughts, sir?

1492
01:29:26,895 --> 01:29:29,498
Clear the way.
I've got the undo disk.

1493
01:29:29,531 --> 01:29:32,934
[overlapping voices]

1494
01:29:29,531 --> 01:29:32,934
Commander, trust me.

1495
01:29:32,967 --> 01:29:35,804
We'll talk later, OK?
I've got a space-stay to save.

1496
01:29:37,005 --> 01:29:40,409
Total system failure
in 20 seconds.

1497
01:29:40,442 --> 01:29:42,378
Not if I can help it.

1498
01:29:44,712 --> 01:29:46,648
Incorrect access code.

1499
01:29:46,681 --> 01:29:50,886
I know this. I can do this.

1500
01:29:46,681 --> 01:29:50,886
What's the story, Zenon?

1501
01:29:50,919 --> 01:29:53,655
It all turned out to be
exactly like I told you, sir.

1502
01:29:53,688 --> 01:29:56,758
Wyndham had Lutz place this
virus in our computer,

1503
01:29:56,791 --> 01:29:59,027
so he'd collect
the insurance money.

1504
01:29:59,060 --> 01:30:00,929
Incorrect access code.

1505
01:30:00,962 --> 01:30:04,533
Total system failure
in 10 seconds.

1506
01:30:04,566 --> 01:30:07,569
Nine... eight... seven...

1507
01:30:07,602 --> 01:30:08,904
Incorrect access code.

1508
01:30:08,937 --> 01:30:13,409
...six... five...

1511
01:30:26,821 --> 01:30:29,491
Total System rehabilitated.

1512
01:30:29,524 --> 01:30:30,826
[cheering]

1513
01:30:31,593 --> 01:30:32,928
Oh, sweetheart!

1514
01:30:36,831 --> 01:30:38,900
Is it over? Is it safe?

1515
01:30:38,933 --> 01:30:41,603
Lieutenant Schiff,
arrest those men!

1516
01:30:50,712 --> 01:30:52,247
You are so brilliant.

1517
01:30:52,280 --> 01:30:54,683
I am so proud of you.

1518
01:30:54,716 --> 01:30:56,785
[cheering]

1519
01:31:03,992 --> 01:31:07,662
Thank you.

1520
01:31:07,695 --> 01:31:09,097
Thank you!

1521
01:31:09,130 --> 01:31:11,566
Thank you. Thanks.

1522
01:31:11,599 --> 01:31:15,103
We love you Proto Zoa!

1523
01:31:15,136 --> 01:31:17,005
Thank you,
ladies and gentlemen.

1524
01:31:17,038 --> 01:31:20,275
Settle down, settle down,
we've still got
a long way to go.

1525
01:31:20,308 --> 01:31:22,511
Now, uh,
this next part of the show

1526
01:31:22,544 --> 01:31:25,280
was supposed to be
when we bring up
our contest winner.

1527
01:31:25,313 --> 01:31:29,985
But she's kind of requested
a slight alteration
in our plans.

1528
01:31:30,018 --> 01:31:32,754
I mean, once you
save an entire space station,

1529
01:31:32,787 --> 01:31:35,123
what can you possibly do
for an encore, right?

1530
01:31:35,156 --> 01:31:36,859
[cheering]

1531
01:31:38,826 --> 01:31:42,664
So, she's asked me
to do two things for her.

1532
01:31:42,697 --> 01:31:47,002
Number one, she'd like me
to dedicate this next song

1533
01:31:47,035 --> 01:31:50,672
to a very lucky guy
named Greg.

1534
01:31:50,705 --> 01:31:52,541
[applause]

1535
01:31:55,777 --> 01:31:57,746

1538
01:32:16,798 --> 01:32:20,869
? Star-gazing mega fast you
hit me like a cosmic blast ?

1539
01:32:20,902 --> 01:32:24,106
? You've given me
a technicolor world ?

1540
01:32:25,640 --> 01:32:27,342
? Putting me in overdrive ?

1541
01:32:27,375 --> 01:32:29,778
? Speed of light
I'm so alive ?

1542
01:32:29,811 --> 01:32:32,848
? Could you be
my super nova girl ?

1543
01:32:34,649 --> 01:32:38,086
? Interplanetary,
mega stellar, hydrostatic ?

1544
01:32:38,119 --> 01:32:40,055

between us ?

01:32:40,088 --> 01:32:42,023
? Our love is automatic ?

? Visions of your pretty face
send me into hyperspace ?

? Caught up
in a planetary world ?

1557
01:33:16,157 --> 01:33:18,159
? Breathing in you
give me air ?

1558
01:33:18,192 --> 01:33:20,729
? I'm living off
your solar flare ?

1559
01:33:20,762 --> 01:33:25,066

1570
01:33:51,793 --> 01:33:55,730
All right,
bring it down, boys.
And number two, Zenon asked me

1571
01:33:55,763 --> 01:33:59,734
to pass her winning dance
on to somebody she says
was always there for her,

1572
01:33:59,767 --> 01:34:02,837
without question, up for every
adventure she ever proposes.

1573
01:34:02,870 --> 01:34:06,675
Everything
a B.F. should be.

1574
01:34:06,708 --> 01:34:08,743
Nebula?

1576
01:34:08,776 --> 01:34:11,146
According to Zenon,
you're the true winner.

1577
01:34:11,179 --> 01:34:13,115
So, why don't you
come on up here! Come on.

1578
01:34:14,482 --> 01:34:15,950
Go!

1579
01:34:15,983 --> 01:34:18,987
No, no. You won. You go.

1580
01:34:19,020 --> 01:34:22,290
I got to ride all the way back
on the shuttle with him.

1581
01:34:22,323 --> 01:34:24,826
Go, Neb!

1582
01:34:22,323 --> 01:34:24,826
I'm all yours.

1583
01:34:24,859 --> 01:34:28,763
Somebody better get up here
before I get a complex!

1584
01:34:28,796 --> 01:34:30,065
Go!

1588
01:34:41,209 --> 01:34:44,913
Did I ever tell you how truly
amazing I think you are?

1589
01:34:44,946 --> 01:34:47,782
Only about 22 kajillion times
since I've been home.

1598

Cetus-Lupeedus,
it's good to have you home.

1599
01:35:09,237 --> 01:35:10,872
It's great
to have you home.
