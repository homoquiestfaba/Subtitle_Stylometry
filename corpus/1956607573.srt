be carrying a little
thing like that.

size of my knife.

It was 5 years ago,
wasn't it?
5 years ago.

00:07:15,201 --> 00:07:16,769
He said you
were crazy. You know
what? He was right?

70
00:07:16,803 --> 00:07:17,703
Max said that?

71
00:07:17,737 --> 00:07:18,304
Yeah, he did.

72
00:07:18,337 --> 00:07:19,806
When did you see him last?

A long time ago.

74
00:07:21,274 --> 00:07:24,944
The last time I
saw him was the day
he left home.

And that--i was 16.
That was 9 years
ago, a long time.

give you the key?

77

He mailed it to me.

a job for him.

until my brother
gets home.

get along
just fine, Jaime.

to go with it.

at sotheby's?

work together. So what?

So this, is this
your collection?

That? No.
That's Max's stuff.

I collect
other kind of shit.

shit do you collect?

Oh. Come on. Here.

Better?

183
00:12:24,477 --> 00:12:26,145
That's much better.

Are your hands
getting numb?

last too long.

Remember that?
Whose idea
was that?

That was my idea,
taking the face
instead of the body,

267

because, you know,
he's a movie guy.

Why you got Max's brother
tied to a chair for?

gave it to you?

I had to, all right?

That is it. That's--

298
00:17:51,336 --> 00:17:55,674
I got in the mess
because I trusted
you.

299

was right on the table

in front of us
the whole time
we were sitting there.

301

Why--i mean, you
could have counted that.

302
00:18:04,416 --> 00:18:06,452
You could have counted--

303
00:18:06,485 --> 00:18:08,454
why didn't you count
the money? I mean--

304
00:18:08,487 --> 00:18:11,824
I couldn't do it.
It would have been
impolite, you know.

an idiot in front
of Max's friend.

what the point is.

00:18:35,347 --> 00:18:38,784
Yo, did I tell you
to come with me?

314
00:18:38,817 --> 00:18:41,620
You stay here.

we're calling him for now.

Who are you?

323
00:19:01,507 --> 00:19:03,475
You mean, right now?

324
00:19:03,509 --> 00:19:05,611
She's from
another planet, Jack.

325
00:19:05,644 --> 00:19:06,879
Do you want to talk to her?

326
00:19:06,912 --> 00:19:07,846
Do you want to hear stories

327
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:12,384
about meteors and comets
and little green men?

328
00:19:12,417 --> 00:19:15,821
Of course, it doesn't
make her any more
full of shit than you are.

329
00:19:15,854 --> 00:19:18,524
Baby, why don't you
go and get Angie?

330
00:19:18,557 --> 00:19:19,758
I'll go get Angie now.

331
00:19:22,628 --> 00:19:24,463
I'm from Mars.

332
00:19:24,496 --> 00:19:26,565
Martians know
all your secrets.

333
00:19:26,598 --> 00:19:28,467
Psst. Get in there.

334
00:19:31,370 --> 00:19:32,337
What is that all about?

335
00:19:32,371 --> 00:19:34,973
Ask piece.
She's his.

336
00:19:35,007 --> 00:19:35,774
He picked her up
awhile ago

337
00:19:35,807 --> 00:19:37,676
when we were living
in New Orleans.

338
00:19:37,709 --> 00:19:38,977
She was trying
to sell

339
00:19:39,011 --> 00:19:40,846
magnolia blossoms
to the people.

340
00:19:40,879 --> 00:19:42,881
Fly!

341
00:19:42,915 --> 00:19:45,584
What are you doing?
What did I tell you?

342
00:19:45,617 --> 00:19:46,552
Sorry.

343
00:19:46,585 --> 00:19:48,287
That's ok.

344
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:50,856
Anyway, you know,
she was trying to
sell these flowers

345
00:19:50,889 --> 00:19:52,824
and she had
the idea all wrong,

346
00:19:52,858 --> 00:19:54,593
so she was actually
paying people

347
00:19:54,626 --> 00:19:56,261
to take
the things from her.

348
00:19:56,295 --> 00:19:58,497
When we're getting
ready to leave town,

349
00:19:58,530 --> 00:20:01,333
piece decides
to bring her along.

350
00:20:01,366 --> 00:20:02,668
I don't know.
I guess it makes him
feel important,

351
00:20:02,701 --> 00:20:04,670
you know,
to have a human pet.

352
00:20:04,703 --> 00:20:06,972

first came to this city?

king Charles iv
of Spain.

as the Spanish judges.

was willing to pay
very well for them.

00:30:50,215 --> 00:30:50,982
Shut the fuck up!

527
00:30:51,015 --> 00:30:53,051
Yes. We need
the money.

528
00:30:53,084 --> 00:30:55,453
"We need the money."
"We need the money."

529
00:30:55,486 --> 00:30:57,655
Well, you're sounding
like a wife.

530
00:30:57,689 --> 00:31:00,491
We can't say no,
and you know it.
We can't say no.

531
00:31:00,525 --> 00:31:03,661
This is not what we do.
We are not bodyguards.

532
00:31:03,695 --> 00:31:04,629
We are crooks.

533
00:31:04,662 --> 00:31:07,131
We don't even know if he
has a decent plan yet.

534
00:31:07,165 --> 00:31:08,566
Jack, what's
your plan?

535
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:10,201
We're set to meet
tonight at midnight

536
00:31:10,235 --> 00:31:11,970
at a warehouse
over on Hartford.

537
00:31:12,003 --> 00:31:14,138
I got the merchandise.
I've got a rented Van.

538
00:31:14,172 --> 00:31:16,641
All I need is backup in case
they try something stupid.

539
00:31:16,674 --> 00:31:19,143
All I need you to do is
watch my sorry ass, Max.

540
00:31:19,177 --> 00:31:20,378
His sorry ass.
We can do that.

541
00:31:20,411 --> 00:31:21,579
We can watch
his sorry ass.

542
00:31:21,613 --> 00:31:23,047
We can
definitely
do that.

543
00:31:23,081 --> 00:31:25,083
Between you
and piece
and me,

544
00:31:25,116 --> 00:31:27,285
we can
definitely--ooh.

545
00:31:27,318 --> 00:31:28,286
What?

546
00:31:28,319 --> 00:31:29,287
Piece.

547
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:30,288
What?

548
00:31:30,321 --> 00:31:31,489
Wellings may
have shot him,

549
00:31:31,522 --> 00:31:33,124
like,
2 hours ago.

550
00:31:33,157 --> 00:31:33,925
Oh.

551
00:31:33,958 --> 00:31:35,159
When were you
going to tell me that?

552
00:31:35,193 --> 00:31:37,395
It just didn't
come up.

553
00:31:37,428 --> 00:31:39,297
Is he dead or alive?

554
00:31:39,330 --> 00:31:41,366
You know
wellings.
I mean--

555
00:31:41,399 --> 00:31:46,004
don't even try--don't
even think about doing
this without piece.

556
00:31:46,037 --> 00:31:47,605
No, right?

557
00:31:47,639 --> 00:31:50,141
No. I'm not
going to go deal
with wellings.

558
00:31:50,174 --> 00:31:50,742
I'm not.

559
00:31:50,775 --> 00:31:51,609
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. No.

560
00:31:51,643 --> 00:31:54,078
You're sorry
what?

561
00:31:54,112 --> 00:31:55,280
I've done
my research on both of you.

562
00:31:55,313 --> 00:31:57,282
You're both
very capable people, right,

563
00:31:57,315 --> 00:31:59,984
but in all due respect,
when it comes to guns,

564
00:32:00,018 --> 00:32:02,620
neither one of you can hit
the broadside of a barn.

565
00:32:02,654 --> 00:32:04,689
It was very nice meeting
both of you,

566
00:32:04,722 --> 00:32:06,357
but I'm gonna take
my business elsewhere.

567
00:32:06,391 --> 00:32:08,326
Thank you.

568
00:32:08,359 --> 00:32:11,195
Sit the fuck down.
Sit the fuck down!

569
00:32:11,229 --> 00:32:13,264
You know what?
I'm going to sit down.

570
00:32:13,298 --> 00:32:14,465
We'll be
right back.

571
00:32:14,499 --> 00:32:16,434
I'm sitting.

572
00:32:21,039 --> 00:32:23,007
What do you want to do?
You want to go
to wellings'.

573
00:32:23,041 --> 00:32:24,208
Are you crazy?

574
00:32:24,242 --> 00:32:25,276
No.we're
going
to go to wellings',
smart ass.

575
00:32:25,310 --> 00:32:26,678
Why?

576
00:32:26,711 --> 00:32:27,645
Why?

577
00:32:30,548 --> 00:32:32,216
Because we need
the fucking money,

578
00:32:32,250 --> 00:32:33,318
that's why.

579
00:32:35,653 --> 00:32:37,388
Ok, ok, ok, ok.

580
00:32:42,226 --> 00:32:44,262
What are we going
to do about him?

581
00:32:44,295 --> 00:32:45,430
I don't want to
him to go around to
hire someone else.

582
00:32:45,463 --> 00:32:46,464
I'm not gonna let
some stranger roam
around in my stuff.

583
00:32:46,497 --> 00:32:49,400
I'm not coming with you,
risk getting my ass shot.

584
00:32:53,071 --> 00:32:55,206
Jack: Aw. Come on.

585

[Swing music playing]

588
00:33:03,381 --> 00:33:07,051
Don't be shy. It's nice
to see the both of you.

589
00:33:07,085 --> 00:33:08,052
Max: Good evening,
wellings.

590
00:33:10,188 --> 00:33:11,589
How you doing tonight?

591
00:33:13,524 --> 00:33:16,294
I see you're cooking
up a little dinner
for yourself there.

592
00:33:16,327 --> 00:33:18,229
A friend of mine
mixed this up
for me.

593
00:33:18,262 --> 00:33:19,664
I don't know
what it is.

594
00:33:19,697 --> 00:33:21,466
I don't know
what it does.

595
00:33:21,499 --> 00:33:23,801
But I can't wait
to find out.

596
00:33:23,835 --> 00:33:26,704
You should let me mix up
something for you sometime.

597
00:33:26,738 --> 00:33:28,473
Oh, no.

598
00:33:28,506 --> 00:33:32,076
I know everything
about you,
spider lady.

599
00:33:32,110 --> 00:33:33,277
Not quite everything.

601
00:33:36,547 --> 00:33:37,715
How you doing,
piece?

602
00:33:37,749 --> 00:33:39,550
Fine. And you?

603
00:33:39,584 --> 00:33:42,186
Good, thanks. Piece,
you can do things on
your own, can't you?

604
00:33:42,220 --> 00:33:43,855
You can handle
things by yourself.

605
00:33:43,888 --> 00:33:45,456
Max: You guys finished?

606
00:33:45,490 --> 00:33:46,657
Hmm?

607
00:33:46,691 --> 00:33:47,658
Done?

608
00:33:47,692 --> 00:33:49,394
Yeah.

609
00:33:52,563 --> 00:33:57,135
Well, I'm glad to see you
didn't rush to judgment

610
00:33:57,168 --> 00:34:00,138
on our little friend
there.

611
00:34:00,171 --> 00:34:02,707
What did he say to you?

612
00:34:02,740 --> 00:34:03,641
He called me
a cheat...

613
00:34:03,674 --> 00:34:05,410
Piece: That's right.

614
00:34:05,443 --> 00:34:06,778
Said I
rooked him.

615
00:34:06,811 --> 00:34:08,346
Well, you
did
rook him.

616
00:34:08,379 --> 00:34:10,548
So I made
a mistake.

617
00:34:10,581 --> 00:34:11,649
Ok...

618
00:34:11,682 --> 00:34:14,318
I ain't got to hear
about it from
the likes of you.

619
00:34:14,352 --> 00:34:19,123

deserve
whatever they get.

620

Ok, let's talk
through this, wellings.

It's 9:00 on the nose.
Come on.

Well, didn't Max tell you
to untie me at 9:00?

628

Isn't that what he said,
"9:00, untie him"?

No.

you couldn't untie me

Mars boys?

701
00:38:00,044 --> 00:38:02,013
You got to go
way back to Mars.

702
00:38:02,046 --> 00:38:03,848
And to get back to Mars,
you're gonna need
a lot of money,

703
00:38:03,881 --> 00:38:06,851
so why don't you
come over here right now
and reach into my pocket?

704
00:38:06,884 --> 00:38:08,519
Come here, Mars girl,
reach in my pocket.

705
00:38:08,552 --> 00:38:09,787
[Chuckling]

706
00:38:09,820 --> 00:38:12,356
What are you laughing at?
Come here and reach
into my pocket.

707
00:38:12,390 --> 00:38:13,357
No!

708
00:38:13,391 --> 00:38:14,558
No?

709
00:38:14,592 --> 00:38:17,828
I don't need money
to get to Mars.

710
00:38:17,862 --> 00:38:18,963
Someone will come
for me.

711
00:38:18,996 --> 00:38:20,665
They will, huh?

712
00:38:20,698 --> 00:38:21,766
Uh-huh.

713
00:38:23,901 --> 00:38:27,638
Someday, a beautiful
stranger will come

714
00:38:27,672 --> 00:38:30,441
and take me
back to where
I really belong,

715
00:38:30,474 --> 00:38:32,576
and then I'll be
truly happy.

716
00:38:35,746 --> 00:38:38,616
But maybe i'm
the beautiful stranger.

717
00:38:38,649 --> 00:38:39,717
[Chuckling]

718
00:38:39,750 --> 00:38:41,385
No.

719
00:38:45,156 --> 00:38:46,157
Men where I
come from...

720
00:38:46,190 --> 00:38:48,959
Don't have scars.

721
00:38:58,769 --> 00:39:00,738
Piece:
It was a goddamn
good fight in there.

722
00:39:00,771 --> 00:39:03,040
Jaime: Very slick talking
in there, brother pio.

723
00:39:03,074 --> 00:39:05,009
Very slick hands,
sister Mary Agnes.

724
00:39:05,042 --> 00:39:06,744
Thank you.
Merci.

725
00:39:06,777 --> 00:39:09,180
I knew it
was coming, and I
didn't even see it.

726
00:39:09,213 --> 00:39:10,614
What did you
put in there?

727
00:39:10,648 --> 00:39:14,552
Coupons from radio shack,
you know.

728
00:39:14,585 --> 00:39:18,189
Here. Where did you find
$3,000 in cash?

729
00:39:18,222 --> 00:39:20,057
Jack's wallet.

730
00:39:20,091 --> 00:39:23,861
Who carries that kind of
money around with them
anyway, huh?

731
00:39:23,894 --> 00:39:25,463
Successful people, baby.

732
00:39:28,232 --> 00:39:30,968
Jaime, what we do
back there we did well.

733
00:39:31,001 --> 00:39:33,938
We should stick
with what we do well.

734
00:39:33,971 --> 00:39:34,805
What we did
back there is

735
00:39:34,839 --> 00:39:38,109
not going to make us
$100,000 each, baby.

736
00:39:38,142 --> 00:39:40,678
One-zero-zero-
zero-zero-zero.

737
00:39:40,711 --> 00:39:41,679
I don't think--

738
00:39:41,712 --> 00:39:43,581
what?

739
00:39:43,614 --> 00:39:46,083
I got a bad feeling
about this guy.

740
00:39:46,117 --> 00:39:46,851
Something's gonna go wrong.

741
00:39:46,884 --> 00:39:49,053
Yeah, it's gonna be
too easy, ok?

742
00:39:49,086 --> 00:39:50,721
Come on, piece,
let's go.

743
00:39:50,755 --> 00:39:52,556
I'm gonna go
to piece's
apartment.

744
00:39:52,590 --> 00:39:53,524
He's gonna pick
out for me,

745
00:39:53,557 --> 00:39:54,892
like,
a nice gown
for tonight.

746
00:39:54,925 --> 00:39:58,596
You go home. Get
the mannequins
ready.

747
00:39:58,629 --> 00:40:00,030
We'll be there
in, you know...

748
00:40:00,064 --> 00:40:00,631
What for?

749
00:40:00,664 --> 00:40:02,733
A few minutes.
Come on...

750
00:40:02,767 --> 00:40:03,934
What for?

751
00:40:03,968 --> 00:40:05,236
Get out. Get out.

752
00:40:05,269 --> 00:40:06,737
Come on.
Something.
Get in the car.

753
00:40:06,771 --> 00:40:08,572
Ah, just
get going.

754
00:40:08,606 --> 00:40:11,041
Why?! Why?!
Because you say so, huh?

755
00:40:11,075 --> 00:40:13,043
Because you say so?

756
00:40:13,077 --> 00:40:14,445
[Jaime blows loud kiss]

757
00:40:18,582 --> 00:40:20,851
Fine, fine.

758
00:40:26,557 --> 00:40:28,125
I've got
a hole in my wrist.

759
00:40:28,159 --> 00:40:31,128
You're lucky it's not
around your neck.

760
00:40:31,162 --> 00:40:32,930
Help me out here.

761
00:40:32,963 --> 00:40:34,832
What are you doing?

762
00:40:34,865 --> 00:40:36,834
Another one of
Jaime's stupid ideas--

763
00:40:36,867 --> 00:40:39,703
dress the mannequins up,
put them in the car,

764
00:40:39,737 --> 00:40:42,239
park it in front of
the warehouse, and when
these people see it--

765
00:40:42,273 --> 00:40:46,010
then they think
that you've got
an army of backup.

766
00:40:46,043 --> 00:40:47,178
It's a genius idea.

767
00:40:47,211 --> 00:40:48,579
I know.

768
00:40:48,612 --> 00:40:49,980
[Jack chuckles]

769
00:40:50,014 --> 00:40:51,549
Maybe I'm talking
to the wrong person.

770
00:40:51,582 --> 00:40:53,217
I mean, I just
naturally figured

771
00:40:53,250 --> 00:40:55,920
that you were
in charge, but...

772
00:40:57,588 --> 00:40:59,123
Oh, I'm sorry.

773
00:40:59,156 --> 00:40:59,924
I am on your team.

774
00:40:59,957 --> 00:41:02,259
I just don't know

775
00:41:02,293 --> 00:41:06,163
why everyone else
doesn't feel that
way around here.

776
00:41:06,197 --> 00:41:07,998
Are you talking
about Jaime?

777
00:41:08,032 --> 00:41:10,968
Well,
the whole thing.

778
00:41:11,001 --> 00:41:11,735
Yeah.

779
00:41:11,769 --> 00:41:14,738
Well, she used to.

780
00:41:14,772 --> 00:41:17,641
You know, what bothers me
about you people, Max?

781
00:41:18,676 --> 00:41:22,780
I haven't seen
a single gun since
I've been here,

782
00:41:22,813 --> 00:41:26,550
unless you're talking
about...These.

783
00:41:26,584 --> 00:41:28,919
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
Look...

784
00:41:28,953 --> 00:41:32,022
First of all,
don't go snooping around
and touching my things.

785
00:41:33,858 --> 00:41:35,292
Secondly, they're not guns.

786
00:41:37,161 --> 00:41:38,629
They're antiques...

787
00:41:42,199 --> 00:41:43,267
French flintlocks.

788
00:41:48,272 --> 00:41:49,840
It's my
newest addition.

789
00:41:57,882 --> 00:41:59,683
Oh...

790
00:41:59,717 --> 00:42:01,151
That is nice.

791
00:42:01,185 --> 00:42:03,287
Old dueling pistols.

792
00:42:05,022 --> 00:42:06,957
They come
in a boxed set.

793
00:42:09,093 --> 00:42:10,761
Yeah? Yeah?

794
00:42:10,794 --> 00:42:13,030
I don't have
all the literature
on them yet.

795
00:42:13,063 --> 00:42:15,833
I've only had them
a month or so.
But eventually--

796
00:42:15,866 --> 00:42:17,268
where are they from?

797
00:42:17,301 --> 00:42:19,670
See the tag?
It says "laroche."

798
00:42:19,703 --> 00:42:21,739
That's French--
laroche.

799
00:42:21,772 --> 00:42:23,774
What's it mean--
laroche?

800
00:42:23,807 --> 00:42:26,076
It doesn't
mean anything. It's
a town in France.

801
00:42:26,110 --> 00:42:28,178
Mm-hmm.

802
00:42:28,212 --> 00:42:29,313
Quite grim,
aren't they?

803
00:42:29,346 --> 00:42:30,281
Yeah.

804
00:42:32,783 --> 00:42:34,818
Guns make me nervous.

805
00:42:34,852 --> 00:42:36,120
Never carried one.

806
00:42:36,153 --> 00:42:37,821
Us either.

807
00:42:37,855 --> 00:42:41,959
If you need a gun,
you're doing
something wrong.

808
00:42:41,992 --> 00:42:44,962
That's why
piece has so many.

809
00:42:44,995 --> 00:42:46,363
He does
everything wrong.

810
00:42:46,397 --> 00:42:47,865
[Chuckles softly]

811
00:42:52,703 --> 00:42:57,374
Collecting is about
Patience, Jack...

812
00:42:57,408 --> 00:42:58,442
Unless you've got
a lot of money--

813
00:42:58,475 --> 00:43:01,378
you can put
all your collection
together at once.

814
00:43:01,412 --> 00:43:03,681
See this burgonet here?

815
00:43:03,714 --> 00:43:06,951
15th century.

816
00:43:06,984 --> 00:43:09,320
It's part of
a complete
set of armor

817
00:43:09,353 --> 00:43:12,690
made by
the missaglia family
of Milano.

818
00:43:14,091 --> 00:43:15,960
I only have
the helmet
right now,

819
00:43:15,993 --> 00:43:19,863
but I know a guy who
has the pauldrons.

820
00:43:22,166 --> 00:43:25,903
When I get it
all together...

821
00:43:25,936 --> 00:43:27,338
You know,
bit by bit,
that's ok.

822
00:43:27,371 --> 00:43:28,439
I have what I have,
and what I have
makes me happy.

823
00:43:28,472 --> 00:43:32,042
I have what I have,
and what I have
makes me happy.

824
00:43:32,076 --> 00:43:34,111
It's beautiful.
It really is.

825
00:43:34,144 --> 00:43:36,780
I know.

826
00:43:36,814 --> 00:43:39,450
But so is a new caddy,

827
00:43:39,483 --> 00:43:41,251
so is new furniture.

828
00:43:42,920 --> 00:43:44,922
So, why do you have
a cabinet full of antiques?

829
00:43:44,955 --> 00:43:48,258
Why does your guy
want the Spanish
judges, hmm?

830
00:43:48,292 --> 00:43:49,994
For the beauty?

831
00:43:50,027 --> 00:43:52,129
For an investment?

832
00:43:52,162 --> 00:43:54,431
No.

833
00:43:54,465 --> 00:43:56,867
Antiques are not
about money, Jack.

834
00:43:56,900 --> 00:43:59,103
They're not even
about the beauty.

835
00:43:59,136 --> 00:44:01,005
They're about ownership.

836
00:44:01,038 --> 00:44:03,474
They're about
position.

837
00:44:03,507 --> 00:44:06,744
They're about...
Success.

838
00:44:08,746 --> 00:44:09,947
They're about
saying,

839
00:44:09,980 --> 00:44:12,249
"I have the power
to reach back
into the past

840
00:44:12,282 --> 00:44:14,385
and grab
anything I want,
make it mine."

841
00:44:14,418 --> 00:44:18,155
An antique can say
that. A new caddy
can never say that.

842
00:44:18,188 --> 00:44:19,423
Oh, I understand
that completely.

843
00:44:19,456 --> 00:44:20,991
You think a lot
about that, though,

844
00:44:21,025 --> 00:44:24,228
about being
a successful man,

845
00:44:24,261 --> 00:44:26,997
about being treated
the way you deserve
to be treated.

846
00:44:29,033 --> 00:44:30,434
Yeah,
I'll get there.

847
00:44:32,870 --> 00:44:34,271
You'll see.

848
00:44:38,008 --> 00:44:39,076
Detroit.

849
00:44:39,109 --> 00:44:40,077
Detroit.

850
00:44:40,110 --> 00:44:41,812
Detroit.

851
00:44:41,845 --> 00:44:42,446
Or maybe...

852
00:44:42,479 --> 00:44:44,281
Maybe Chicago
after that.

853
00:44:44,314 --> 00:44:45,249
Here's to Texas

854
00:44:45,282 --> 00:44:47,351
the year
after that, huh?

855
00:44:49,887 --> 00:44:55,526
We have chosen a very
tough business, Max.

856
00:44:55,559 --> 00:44:57,094
It's hard enough
to go at it alone,

857
00:44:57,127 --> 00:44:59,329
and then you've got
all these dependents.
It's just--

858
00:44:59,363 --> 00:45:00,764
that's my problem.

859
00:45:00,798 --> 00:45:03,901
If I was an independent
operator again, you know,
I'd get it like that.

860
00:45:03,934 --> 00:45:06,136
Like that.

861
00:45:06,170 --> 00:45:06,870
Jaime.

862
00:45:06,904 --> 00:45:07,771
Jaime.

863
00:45:07,805 --> 00:45:10,808
What does she know
about being successful?

864
00:45:10,841 --> 00:45:13,544
Do you know what she has
in the closet back there?

865
00:45:13,577 --> 00:45:15,546
You're talking about
the poisons, right?

866
00:45:15,579 --> 00:45:17,014
Unbelievable.
Unbelievable.

867
00:45:17,047 --> 00:45:20,217
With a job like ours,
a hobby like that.

868
00:45:20,250 --> 00:45:23,353
And don't think it
makes for comfortable
living arrangements.

869
00:45:23,387 --> 00:45:26,156
Every time
we get in a fight,

870
00:45:26,190 --> 00:45:28,559
I have to stay up
all night

871
00:45:28,592 --> 00:45:31,095
and listen for
the closet door to open.

872
00:45:31,128 --> 00:45:32,396
That ain't right.

873
00:45:32,429 --> 00:45:35,132
It's selfish
is what it is.

874
00:45:35,165 --> 00:45:36,400
The bitch.

875

go up on the roof?

Uh, he goes there
to think, you know?

936
00:48:33,410 --> 00:48:36,947
Max likes
to have everything
thought out in advance.

937

You wouldn't want him,
you know, jumping
to conclusions here.

Well, Max
is on the roof.

945

What Max
doesn't know
won't hurt him.

All right.

makes you nervous?

I like surprises.

950
00:49:33,570 --> 00:49:37,541
That's why Max and I
are so unhealthy
together--

951
00:49:37,574 --> 00:49:39,543
because he's
a control freak,

952

not that kind of girl.

Ok. Let's go.

1055
00:59:33,836 --> 00:59:35,271
What are you
doing?

1056
00:59:35,305 --> 00:59:38,074
Uh, hairs in the carpet
and stuff.

1057
00:59:38,107 --> 00:59:39,776
Ok. Gloves?

1058
00:59:39,809 --> 00:59:42,178
Everybody had
their gloves on, yes?

1059
00:59:42,211 --> 00:59:44,714
Nobody touched anything
without their gloves?

1060
00:59:44,747 --> 00:59:46,416
Is that correct?

1061
00:59:46,449 --> 00:59:48,084
Right.

1062
00:59:52,255 --> 00:59:54,691
Shit. I didn't
even think
about it.

1063
00:59:54,724 --> 00:59:57,093
You...are a problem.

1064
00:59:58,094 --> 01:00:01,664
What are we going to
do about this?

1065
01:00:01,698 --> 01:00:02,999
Torch the Van.

1066
01:00:06,202 --> 01:00:08,738
Torch the Van.

1067
01:00:08,771 --> 01:00:10,173
Right?

1068
01:00:28,257 --> 01:00:32,228
No. We're not going
to torch the Van.

1069
01:00:32,261 --> 01:00:36,199
You and I are going
to come back here
tomorrow morning.

1070
01:00:36,232 --> 01:00:38,368
We'll get rid of this.

1071
01:00:38,401 --> 01:00:41,104
Nobody will find it
before then.

1072
01:00:41,137 --> 01:00:42,772
Good. Can we go now?

1073
01:00:49,178 --> 01:00:52,181
Come on.
You ready?

1074
01:00:52,215 --> 01:00:54,484
Don't worry, Jack.
I'll protect you.

1075
01:00:54,517 --> 01:00:55,985
Protect me
from what?

1076
01:00:56,019 --> 01:00:58,321
Is anything else
going to go wrong?

1077
01:00:58,354 --> 01:00:59,789
Yeah.

1078
01:01:01,190 --> 01:01:02,859
Here.

1079
01:01:02,892 --> 01:01:05,161
You can tell me now.
What happened in there?

1080
01:01:05,194 --> 01:01:07,163
Look, what you saw
is what went on.

1081
01:01:07,196 --> 01:01:09,499
What? I didn't see
anything. I didn't
see a damn thing.

1082
01:01:09,532 --> 01:01:12,869
Jack said
somebody pulled
a gun on him.

1083
01:01:12,902 --> 01:01:14,837
He said hit him,
so I hit him.

1084
01:01:14,871 --> 01:01:16,072
Max, is that true?

1085
01:01:17,006 --> 01:01:18,441
Jack: I can't get
the case open!

1086
01:01:18,474 --> 01:01:21,411
I can open it
with my X-ray
vision.

1087
01:01:21,444 --> 01:01:24,380
Jamie: It doesn't
make any sense.

1088
01:01:24,414 --> 01:01:26,516
Why didn't they wait
for Jack to get away
from the Van first?

1089
01:01:26,549 --> 01:01:28,351
Just shut the fuck up
for a while.

1090
01:01:28,384 --> 01:01:30,053
You make so much noise.

1091
01:01:30,086 --> 01:01:32,422
What about you, Max?
You were supposed to
be the lookout.

1092
01:01:32,455 --> 01:01:35,391
The lookout!
You were supposed
to be watching!

1093
01:01:35,425 --> 01:01:37,293
Why did Jack have to
see the fucking gun?

1094
01:01:37,326 --> 01:01:38,828
You were supposed
to be watching.

1095
01:01:38,861 --> 01:01:40,296
You're really starting
to piss me off.

1096
01:01:40,329 --> 01:01:41,964
Ok. You know
what we need?

1097
01:01:41,998 --> 01:01:44,167
We need, like, a rock, ok?
Or an electric drill.

1098
01:01:44,200 --> 01:01:46,202
Does anyone have a drill?
Something, anything.

1099
01:01:46,235 --> 01:01:49,105
Oh, fine.
You know what I'll do?
I'll just go ask my super.

1100
01:01:49,138 --> 01:01:51,107
You know why? Because he's
probably the only one
in this goddamn city

1101
01:01:51,140 --> 01:01:52,942
that doesn't know
what we did yet.

1102
01:01:52,975 --> 01:01:54,777
Jamie: You're being
a prick, Max.

1103
01:01:54,811 --> 01:01:56,312
Mars girl: I can open it
with my X-ray vision.

1104
01:01:56,345 --> 01:01:57,980
You're always being
a prick!

1105
01:01:58,014 --> 01:02:00,116
You know, I'm thinking
that I think

1106
01:02:00,149 --> 01:02:03,352
that you're not
thinking who you're
talking to here!

1107
01:02:03,386 --> 01:02:05,555
Sure I do.
I'm talking to a prick.

1108
01:02:05,588 --> 01:02:08,391
All right.
That's it. Come on.
Come here, you!

1109
01:02:08,424 --> 01:02:09,892
Get back
in the fucking car!

1110
01:02:09,926 --> 01:02:11,194
You get out of the way!

1111
01:02:11,227 --> 01:02:12,328
Aah!

1112
01:02:12,361 --> 01:02:13,463
Ok, ok, ok.

1113
01:02:13,496 --> 01:02:15,531
You will not hurt
Jamie again.

1114
01:02:15,565 --> 01:02:17,133
Max: What? What did I do?

1115
01:02:17,166 --> 01:02:18,534
Jack: No, no!
That's enough!
Now, listen to me.

1116
01:02:18,568 --> 01:02:20,136
We've got the case.

1117
01:02:20,169 --> 01:02:21,504
Nobody's hurt.
These are good things.

1118
01:02:21,537 --> 01:02:25,241
We need to focus right now
on getting the thing open.

1119
01:02:25,274 --> 01:02:28,177
Does anyone have an idea
on how to open the case?

1120
01:02:28,211 --> 01:02:30,046
I can open it
with my X-ray vision.

1121
01:02:30,079 --> 01:02:31,914
Oh, girl.
You shut the fuck up!

1122
01:02:31,948 --> 01:02:35,218
Hey, enough already.

1123
01:02:35,251 --> 01:02:36,219
I got an electric drill
at home.

1124
01:02:36,252 --> 01:02:38,054
There you go. Drill.
Drill at home. Let's go.

1125
01:02:38,087 --> 01:02:39,555
Max: I'll drop you off.

1126
01:02:39,589 --> 01:02:41,090
You'll drop me off?

1127
01:02:41,124 --> 01:02:42,959
Yeah. Yeah. We'll wait
at the apartment.

1128
01:02:42,992 --> 01:02:44,360
You can fucking walk.

1129
01:02:44,393 --> 01:02:46,262
You ok, baby?

1130
01:02:46,295 --> 01:02:47,964
Fine.
Fine.

1131
01:02:47,997 --> 01:02:49,465
Fine.
Fine.

1132
01:02:49,499 --> 01:02:52,835
Good. Yeah. That way,
we'll walk back.
There's a 7-Eleven.

1133
01:02:52,869 --> 01:02:55,938
Maybe we could get some
watermelon popsicles
or something.

1134
01:02:55,972 --> 01:02:57,607
Piece, we want to do
this tonight, ok?

1135
01:02:57,640 --> 01:02:58,608
You leave the girl
with us, you go,

1136
01:02:58,641 --> 01:03:01,043
pick up
the fucking drill,
and come back home.

1137
01:03:01,077 --> 01:03:04,180
Enough already.

1138
01:03:04,213 --> 01:03:05,548
Ok? Let's go. Come on.

1139
01:03:05,581 --> 01:03:07,917
Piece:
No. I have
your solemn word

1140
01:03:07,950 --> 01:03:09,952
that you
will protect
these women...
Ha!

1141
01:03:09,986 --> 01:03:11,420
If I leave them
with...Whatever
over there.

1142
01:03:11,454 --> 01:03:12,955
Yes, you have
my word.

1143
01:03:12,989 --> 01:03:14,290
Yeah, yeah.
I'm "whatever" now.

1144
01:03:14,323 --> 01:03:18,227
Ok. Get in the car, please.
Get in the car.

1145
01:03:18,261 --> 01:03:20,229
Jamie: Oh, that's what
you're so upset about.

1146
01:03:20,263 --> 01:03:22,231
You wet your pants.
You could have said so.

1147
01:03:22,265 --> 01:03:25,001
Could we just all
shut up for a while
until piece comes back?

1148
01:03:25,034 --> 01:03:27,003
I can open it
with my X-ray vision.

1149
01:03:27,036 --> 01:03:28,504
Get rid of her.
Get her out of here.

1150
01:03:28,538 --> 01:03:30,640
I am sorely tempted
to tear her fucking
tongue out.

1151
01:03:30,673 --> 01:03:33,009
Come on.
Let's go
to my room, baby.

1152
01:03:33,042 --> 01:03:33,609
Prick!
Bye, Jack.

1153
01:03:33,643 --> 01:03:35,311
Night, Mars girl.

1154
01:03:35,344 --> 01:03:37,480
What? I didn't do
anything!

1155
01:03:37,513 --> 01:03:39,549
I didn't do
anything!

1156
01:03:39,582 --> 01:03:41,417
I am going to kill her.

1157
01:03:41,450 --> 01:03:42,685
What?

1158
01:03:42,718 --> 01:03:46,556
That white-faced,
Lily-livered, jong-loving,
hot-blooded whore

1159
01:03:46,589 --> 01:03:47,790
talk to me like that.

1160
01:03:47,823 --> 01:03:49,959
I can talk plenty.
Did you hear the stuff
that she was saying?

1161
01:03:49,992 --> 01:03:51,527
Yeah.
Were you
a witness to that?

1162
01:03:51,561 --> 01:03:54,030
I said yeah.
I am not some hoodlum!

1163
01:03:54,063 --> 01:03:56,065
I am not some lowlife scum

1164
01:03:56,098 --> 01:03:58,267
that hangs around
the street-corner store.

1165
01:03:58,301 --> 01:04:01,571
No.

1166
01:04:01,604 --> 01:04:05,107
What's a guy
going to do, huh?
I run a pretty tight ship,

1167
01:04:05,141 --> 01:04:06,676
and that's truth
under the circumstances

1168
01:04:06,709 --> 01:04:09,545
of having more dependents
than god, I might add.
You'd think--

1169
01:04:09,579 --> 01:04:10,546
hey!

1170
01:04:10,580 --> 01:04:11,948
[Shouting in Italian]

1171
01:04:11,981 --> 01:04:13,549
I'm trying to put
this kid to sleep!

1172
01:04:13,583 --> 01:04:14,951
Then try harder!

1173
01:04:14,984 --> 01:04:17,119
Jack, is he boring you?
Do you want a break?

1174
01:04:17,153 --> 01:04:18,588
No.

1175
01:04:18,621 --> 01:04:20,556
No, no. There's
not going to be
any teaming up on me

1176
01:04:20,590 --> 01:04:22,158
in my household,
thank you!

1177
01:04:25,962 --> 01:04:27,997
Did she tell you
that she was
in prison?

1178
01:04:28,030 --> 01:04:29,699
She mentioned it, yeah.
Juvenile.

1179
01:04:29,732 --> 01:04:32,468
Yeah, but did she
tell you why?

1180
01:04:32,501 --> 01:04:36,305
No. She told you?

1181
01:04:36,339 --> 01:04:36,772
Yeah, but she
made me promise
I can't tell you.

1182
01:04:36,806 --> 01:04:38,007
I can't tell you.

1183
01:04:38,040 --> 01:04:40,042
Yeah. Uh-huh, Jack.
What'd she do?

1184
01:04:40,076 --> 01:04:42,011
I...ok. I just
think that under
the circumstances,

1185
01:04:42,044 --> 01:04:43,579
this is something
you should know.

1186
01:04:43,613 --> 01:04:45,982
Right. What'd she do?

1187
01:04:46,015 --> 01:04:47,617
She killed
her parents.

1188
01:04:54,757 --> 01:04:57,593
Shh! All right.
Stop, stop, stop.

1189
01:04:57,627 --> 01:04:59,128
She told you that?

1190
01:04:59,161 --> 01:05:00,696
Yeah, yeah.
She said that, yeah.

1191
01:05:00,730 --> 01:05:02,498
She's 10 years old,
she gets taken out
of the school play

1192
01:05:02,531 --> 01:05:04,066
because she's not
doing her homework,

1193
01:05:04,100 --> 01:05:07,403
so little Jamie
steals of jar
of formaldehyde.

1194
01:05:07,436 --> 01:05:08,738
Next thing you know,

1195
01:05:08,771 --> 01:05:10,273
her parents
are drinking it.

1196
01:05:10,306 --> 01:05:12,208
Her own parents.

1197
01:05:12,241 --> 01:05:14,010
It's a wretched,
fucking thing.

1198
01:05:14,043 --> 01:05:16,212
The hand
that's feeding her--
chopping it the fuck off,

1199
01:05:16,245 --> 01:05:18,014
but that's exactly
what I thought!
That's exactly--

1200
01:05:18,047 --> 01:05:19,749
fuck, I was right
all along!
About what?

1201
01:05:19,782 --> 01:05:21,517
I mean,
that's exactly it!

1202
01:05:21,550 --> 01:05:24,353
She goes after
the people that
take care of her.

1203
01:05:24,387 --> 01:05:27,189
Right, right.
But she wants
to be taken care of.

1204
01:05:27,223 --> 01:05:28,658
I mean,
that's the clincher.

1205
01:05:28,691 --> 01:05:33,529
People that she can
rely on, like me--

1206
01:05:33,562 --> 01:05:35,431
she...

1207
01:05:35,464 --> 01:05:36,532
You know,
she seeks us out.

1208
01:05:36,565 --> 01:05:40,202
And the minute
she's feeling, like,
a little fenced in

1209
01:05:40,236 --> 01:05:43,072
or something better
comes along--

1210
01:05:43,105 --> 01:05:44,540
oh, I got it.

1211
01:05:44,573 --> 01:05:46,242
Formaldehyde.

1212
01:05:46,275 --> 01:05:48,344
Formaldehyde.
Exactly.

1213
01:05:54,650 --> 01:05:56,752
I thought
you should know, Max.

1214
01:06:01,157 --> 01:06:05,094
Max: I could
wrestle her to the ground
and choke her to death!

1215
01:06:05,127 --> 01:06:06,762
I could tear her to bits!

1216
01:06:06,796 --> 01:06:08,631
Do it, Max. Do it.

1217
01:06:08,664 --> 01:06:12,401
Go in there and take
care of business
right now. Come on.

1218
01:06:15,471 --> 01:06:17,139
Huh?

1219
01:06:17,173 --> 01:06:20,309
No. It wouldn't work.
She doesn't wrestle
to the ground easy.

1220
01:06:20,343 --> 01:06:23,279
You know, I'd have to
take out my gun,
shoot her...

1221
01:06:23,312 --> 01:06:24,613
Hmm. Yeah.

1222
01:06:24,647 --> 01:06:26,382
Wake up the neighbors.

1223
01:06:29,118 --> 01:06:32,655
I thought you told piece
you were going to
protect the women.

1224
01:06:34,757 --> 01:06:38,160
I lied.

1225
01:06:38,194 --> 01:06:40,262
I like to lie.

1226
01:06:40,296 --> 01:06:42,365
It makes me feel
all tingly inside.

1227
01:06:42,398 --> 01:06:45,368
It makes me really want
to kick your ass.

1228
01:06:47,136 --> 01:06:48,771
And you know what else?

1229
01:06:48,804 --> 01:06:50,773
You know, with all
this excitement,

1230
01:06:50,806 --> 01:06:53,442
I forgot I wanted
to kill you, too.

1231
01:06:53,476 --> 01:06:54,744
Why?

1232
01:06:54,777 --> 01:06:56,579
In the warehouse,

1233
01:06:56,612 --> 01:06:59,548
your guy did not
pull a gun, Jack.

1234
01:07:01,150 --> 01:07:02,618
You didn't see
anything.

1235
01:07:02,651 --> 01:07:04,653
You know what I did see?
What?

1236
01:07:04,687 --> 01:07:07,556
When he got back up,
he went like this.

1237
01:07:11,327 --> 01:07:16,365
Now, you want to tell me
how his gun got back
in his holster? Hmm?

1238
01:07:16,399 --> 01:07:18,401
This whole thing would
have gone down clean

1239
01:07:18,434 --> 01:07:20,302
if you hadn't bent it
out of shape, Jack.

1240
01:07:20,336 --> 01:07:22,538
You want to explain
why it is you did that?

1241
01:07:24,473 --> 01:07:25,808
I have my reasons.

1242
01:07:25,841 --> 01:07:27,510
Yeah? They better be good.

1243
01:07:27,543 --> 01:07:29,745
Yeah. I have
reasons that don't
concern you--

1244
01:07:29,779 --> 01:07:31,647
look, I will shoot you
through the head.

1245
01:07:31,680 --> 01:07:33,682
Ah, ah, ah, ah.
You don't want

1246
01:07:33,716 --> 01:07:36,218
to wake up
the neighbors, huh?

1247
01:07:41,757 --> 01:07:44,193
Oh, shit!

1248
01:07:44,226 --> 01:07:46,829
Are you
all right?
Oh, you little shit!

1249
01:07:46,862 --> 01:07:48,364
Is he here for me?

1250
01:07:48,397 --> 01:07:49,765
Calm down, Max.

1251
01:07:49,799 --> 01:07:53,102
What the hell
is going on in there?!

1252
01:07:54,570 --> 01:07:56,338
Nothing!

1253
01:08:02,645 --> 01:08:06,482
You know, it's
like having a mother
in the house, you know?

1254
01:08:08,350 --> 01:08:11,153
You know, I just
want to kill
so many people.

1255
01:08:11,187 --> 01:08:13,322
This whole thing
is getting...

1256
01:08:13,355 --> 01:08:14,890
Way too complicated.

1257
01:08:17,326 --> 01:08:20,329
Yeah. Well,
you know what?
Just worry about Jamie.

1258
01:08:20,362 --> 01:08:22,798
As far as the events
in the warehouse
are concerned,

1259
01:08:22,832 --> 01:08:24,300
you gave
your protection.
You know what, Max?

1260
01:08:24,333 --> 01:08:26,168
You're going to get
what's coming to you.

1261
01:08:26,202 --> 01:08:28,237
Anything outside of that
is my business.

1262
01:08:28,270 --> 01:08:29,405
Leave it alone.

1263
01:08:29,438 --> 01:08:30,940
Think so, huh?
Yeah, I think so.

1264
01:08:30,973 --> 01:08:33,676
Let me ask you
a little question, Max.

1265
01:08:33,709 --> 01:08:37,913
Why didn't we wait
for piece? Why didn't we
just pick up piece?

1266
01:08:37,947 --> 01:08:40,249
You got a dead body
you hadn't planned for.

1267
01:08:40,282 --> 01:08:42,418
You got dirty prints all
over an abandoned Van.

1268
01:08:42,451 --> 01:08:45,254
You got 2 eyewitnesses.
The only face they see
is piece's, huh?

1269
01:08:45,287 --> 01:08:46,755
It wouldn't be
that you and Jamie

1270
01:08:46,789 --> 01:08:49,258
are planning
a little deviation
of your own, would it?

1271
01:08:49,291 --> 01:08:50,626
That's none
of your business.

1272
01:08:50,659 --> 01:08:52,862
Exactly.

1273
01:09:09,712 --> 01:09:11,347
Piece will be here
anytime now.

1274
01:09:11,380 --> 01:09:14,350
So are we going
to do this,
or aren't we?

1275
01:09:14,383 --> 01:09:15,651
Mm-hmm.

1276
01:09:21,257 --> 01:09:23,425
So...

1277
01:09:23,459 --> 01:09:26,195
I'm going to go
and get something ready.

1278
01:09:36,438 --> 01:09:37,940
As long as he's with you,

1279
01:09:37,973 --> 01:09:41,310
he's leading these guys
back to your front door.

1280
01:09:41,343 --> 01:09:44,880
Leave him behind,
the cops arrest him,
and he's going to talk.

1281
01:09:46,815 --> 01:09:49,752
It's the only thing
you can do, Max.

1282
01:09:49,785 --> 01:09:51,587
I know.

1283
01:09:51,620 --> 01:09:53,856
Plus, now you get
another share.

1284
01:09:58,994 --> 01:10:02,431
Of course, you could
have all 3 shares...

1285
01:10:02,464 --> 01:10:03,699
If you wanted.

1286
01:10:03,732 --> 01:10:07,403
Yes, I could. Yes.

1287
01:10:07,436 --> 01:10:09,471
I'm just saying...

1288
01:10:09,505 --> 01:10:11,574
If you think that she's
going to do to you

1289
01:10:11,607 --> 01:10:14,743
what she did
to her own parents...

1290
01:10:14,777 --> 01:10:16,412
Huh?

1291
01:10:19,682 --> 01:10:21,283
No, she's not going
to do that to me.

1292
01:10:21,317 --> 01:10:22,451
[Pounding on door]

1293
01:10:25,020 --> 01:10:26,522
[Pounding]

1294
01:10:26,555 --> 01:10:28,324
Should I go get her?

1295
01:10:33,329 --> 01:10:34,563
Ok.

1296
01:10:35,965 --> 01:10:37,566
Jamie, showtime.

1297
01:10:40,369 --> 01:10:42,471
Ok. Are you--
are you sure
you want to do this?

1298
01:10:42,504 --> 01:10:43,973
Someone has got to suffer.

1299
01:10:44,006 --> 01:10:45,674
Yeah, but piece?
He stood up for you

1300
01:10:45,708 --> 01:10:48,077
when Max
would have knocked
your teeth out.

1301
01:10:48,110 --> 01:10:49,778
What's your point, baby?

1302
01:10:49,812 --> 01:10:52,615
Well, are you sure
you're doing
the right guy?

1303
01:10:52,648 --> 01:10:55,784
Hmm? Yeah.
Come on, come on,
come on, come on.

1304
01:10:55,818 --> 01:10:57,786
Just think about it,
all right?

1305
01:10:57,820 --> 01:10:59,888
Hurry. Go.
Go, go, go, go, go.

1306
01:11:05,661 --> 01:11:07,763
Shit.

1307
01:11:15,137 --> 01:11:16,872
[Door opens]

1308
01:11:19,942 --> 01:11:21,877
We were just talking
about you, piece.

1309
01:11:21,910 --> 01:11:23,512
Yeah?
Jamie! Piece is here!

1310
01:11:24,980 --> 01:11:25,981
Hey.

1311
01:11:26,015 --> 01:11:27,883
Hey.
Got the drill.

1312
01:11:27,916 --> 01:11:28,951
Great.

1313
01:11:28,984 --> 01:11:30,853
Wonderful. Anything
strange happen
on the way here?

1314
01:11:30,886 --> 01:11:32,621
Yeah.

1315
01:11:32,655 --> 01:11:34,757
No. Where's
girl girl?

1316
01:11:34,790 --> 01:11:37,026
Jamie: Sleeping. But, uh,
anyone follow you or...

1317
01:11:37,059 --> 01:11:38,927
No.

1318
01:11:43,699 --> 01:11:44,667
What's going on?

1319
01:11:44,700 --> 01:11:46,068
Max: Nothing.

1320
01:11:46,101 --> 01:11:47,569
Try and open
the case?

1321
01:11:47,603 --> 01:11:49,071
Yeah. Where do i--

1322
01:11:49,104 --> 01:11:50,539
right there.
Oh.

1323
01:12:00,416 --> 01:12:01,750
[Drill buzzing]

1324
01:12:01,784 --> 01:12:04,053
Are you guys as excited
as I am? Yeah?

1325
01:12:04,086 --> 01:12:05,554
More.
Jamie: Yeah.

1326
01:12:10,893 --> 01:12:12,861
[Grunting]

1327
01:12:20,803 --> 01:12:22,438
Watch my stuff!

1328
01:12:22,471 --> 01:12:24,440
Watch my stuff!

1329
01:12:24,473 --> 01:12:25,941
[Cocks gun]

1330
01:12:25,974 --> 01:12:28,143
Max: No! No guns!

1331
01:12:30,879 --> 01:12:32,481
I don't know
where you live,

1332
01:12:32,514 --> 01:12:34,049
but gunshots
are reported
in my neighborhood.

1333
01:13:10,219 --> 01:13:13,021
Guys, thanks
for the help.

1334
01:13:24,867 --> 01:13:26,835
Well, we did it.

1335
01:13:34,276 --> 01:13:35,778
All right. Let's
get this body
out of here

1336
01:13:35,811 --> 01:13:37,613
till we're ready
to dump it.

1337
01:13:39,882 --> 01:13:43,919
Dead bodies.
I don't like
looking at them.

1338
01:13:43,952 --> 01:13:48,123
But, uh, the girl
is sleeping
in the bedroom.

1339
01:13:48,157 --> 01:13:51,527
Then we'll just--
we'll throw him
in the bathtub.

1340
01:13:54,129 --> 01:13:55,130
All right?

1341
01:14:00,702 --> 01:14:02,538
Well, come on
and grab his feet.

1342
01:14:16,852 --> 01:14:18,687
Jack: Get the door.

1343
01:14:18,720 --> 01:14:21,123
Jamie: Shh.
You'll wake her.

1344
01:14:39,808 --> 01:14:40,909
You know, Jack?

1345
01:14:40,943 --> 01:14:42,644
Hmm?

1346
01:14:42,678 --> 01:14:44,646
We were talking
about that guy

1347
01:14:44,680 --> 01:14:48,116
that you set us up
to kill tonight
for no reason.

1348
01:14:48,150 --> 01:14:50,786
Remember?
I remember
the conversation.

1349
01:14:50,819 --> 01:14:52,254
Yeah. I think
I figured out the reason.

1350
01:14:52,287 --> 01:14:54,656
Yeah?
You want to hear it?

1351
01:14:54,690 --> 01:14:57,259
It's probably
not what you're
thinking, Max.

1352
01:14:57,292 --> 01:15:01,163
I think those boxes
of yours are empty.
I think...

1353
01:15:01,196 --> 01:15:04,099
That there are
no Spanish judges.

1354
01:15:04,132 --> 01:15:06,635
I think...

1355
01:15:06,668 --> 01:15:09,271
This was a setup
from the beginning.

1356
01:15:09,304 --> 01:15:11,840
You know,
a little shooting,

1357
01:15:11,874 --> 01:15:14,877
and, uh, you get
paid for something
you never even had.

1358
01:15:14,910 --> 01:15:18,647
Oh, that's pretty--
pretty slick, Jack.

1359
01:15:21,049 --> 01:15:22,784
We
get paid, Max.

1360
01:15:22,818 --> 01:15:26,154
As soon as you get
that case open,
we get paid.

1361
01:15:27,923 --> 01:15:29,091
Funny.

1362
01:15:36,632 --> 01:15:40,269
I'm beginning to think
I'm getting rooked again.

1363
01:15:40,302 --> 01:15:45,707
I mean, nothing
has gone straight
in this deal so far.

1364
01:15:48,176 --> 01:15:50,913
He looks comfortable.

1365
01:15:56,919 --> 01:15:59,821
Here. Let me do this.

1366
01:16:02,658 --> 01:16:03,892
There's money
in that case.

1367
01:16:03,926 --> 01:16:07,629
The guy trusted me
completely.

1368
01:16:07,663 --> 01:16:10,265
Well, then he deserves
what he got.

1369
01:16:10,299 --> 01:16:12,200
[Drill buzzing]

1370
01:16:15,938 --> 01:16:18,206
Come on.

1371
01:16:18,240 --> 01:16:20,075
Come on.

1372
01:16:20,108 --> 01:16:21,376
Tell her to hurry up,
Jack.

1373
01:16:21,410 --> 01:16:24,780
Jack, will you tell him
to back off? I'm trying
to concentrate.

1374
01:16:24,813 --> 01:16:27,783
What, the 2 of you
can't talk to each
other? Come on.

1375
01:16:27,816 --> 01:16:30,252
You got something
to say to me, just
turn around and say it.

1376
01:16:30,285 --> 01:16:31,954
Just stop pushing me, ok?!

1377
01:16:31,987 --> 01:16:34,756
You're being such a baby
about opening this thing!

1378
01:16:34,790 --> 01:16:38,927
Maybe if you paid attention
to what's been going on,
you'd be worried, too.

1379
01:16:38,961 --> 01:16:41,229
Or maybe it's just you
just don't care anymore.

1380
01:16:41,263 --> 01:16:43,932
Maybe you just want
the whole case for yourself.

1381
01:16:43,966 --> 01:16:45,434
Maybe you're thinking
about formaldehyde.

1382
01:16:45,467 --> 01:16:48,770
I don't know what
the fuck you're
talking about now.

1383
01:16:48,804 --> 01:16:51,707
Mm-hmm.
Please,
the 2 of you--

1384
01:16:51,740 --> 01:16:53,408
you know what? This
is just like you.

1385
01:16:53,442 --> 01:16:55,110
You get so--
I mean, you get

1386
01:16:55,143 --> 01:16:56,745
these paranoid
fucking delusions
about anything

1387
01:16:56,778 --> 01:16:58,413
that is not
under your control.

1388
01:16:58,447 --> 01:17:00,115
And you're jealous
of Jack

1389
01:17:00,148 --> 01:17:01,917
because he's
a successful man.
Whoa.

1390
01:17:01,950 --> 01:17:03,752
And he's got
a big plan,

1391
01:17:03,785 --> 01:17:05,954
and you've got
a little tiny plan,

1392
01:17:05,988 --> 01:17:08,924
and his case
is going to be
full of money,

1393
01:17:08,957 --> 01:17:11,460
and if you just
give me one fucking
undisturbed moment

1394
01:17:11,493 --> 01:17:13,228
to open it--

[Giggling]

1396
01:17:26,775 --> 01:17:28,744
No. It--

1397
01:17:28,777 --> 01:17:31,213
open--uh, open it.

1398
01:17:31,246 --> 01:17:33,081
Open the case.

1399
01:17:33,115 --> 01:17:34,716
Ok. Um...

1400
01:17:37,019 --> 01:17:40,222
Yes!

1401
01:17:40,255 --> 01:17:42,124
Oh.

1402
01:17:42,157 --> 01:17:46,194
Don't touch it.
Let's just look at it
for a few seconds.

1403
01:17:47,429 --> 01:17:49,765
That's
a million
dollars.

1404
01:17:49,798 --> 01:17:51,233
That is
a million
dollars.

1405
01:17:51,266 --> 01:17:53,769
How much do you think
is there?

1406
01:17:53,802 --> 01:17:55,037
It's a million
fucking dollars.

1407
01:17:55,070 --> 01:17:57,039
A lot.

1408
01:17:57,072 --> 01:18:00,509
How many of these
do we get? Huh?

1409
01:18:00,542 --> 01:18:05,213
10...no. 15 each.

1410
01:18:05,247 --> 01:18:07,883
Thank you, piece!
Thank you.

1411
01:18:07,916 --> 01:18:09,184
It's all there.

1412
01:18:09,217 --> 01:18:11,053
Oh, my god, baby!

1413
01:18:11,086 --> 01:18:13,889
I can't believe it.
You stupid bitch!

1414
01:18:13,922 --> 01:18:17,059
We finally did something!
We finally did something!

1415
01:18:17,092 --> 01:18:20,062
We finally did!
We finally did!

1416
01:18:20,095 --> 01:18:21,930
Ha ha ha!

1417
01:18:21,963 --> 01:18:23,865
Aah!

1418
01:18:23,899 --> 01:18:25,400
Whoo-hoo!

1419
01:18:25,434 --> 01:18:28,270
[Speaking Italian]

1420
01:18:28,303 --> 01:18:31,940
Jack: Oh, my god.
I can't even count this high.

1421
01:18:31,973 --> 01:18:33,942
Ha ha ha!

1422
01:18:33,975 --> 01:18:35,410
Hey.

1423
01:18:38,013 --> 01:18:39,815
What the fuck is this?

1424
01:18:41,550 --> 01:18:43,318
We got a lot of work
still to do.

1425
01:18:43,351 --> 01:18:45,320
Max, Jamie,
come on. Get up!

1426
01:18:49,057 --> 01:18:52,360
Max, you should
let Jamie get on top...

1427
01:18:52,394 --> 01:18:56,298
Because that's how it was
when she was fucking me!

1428
01:19:10,412 --> 01:19:13,014
Hmm. Sorry.

1429
01:19:18,587 --> 01:19:21,123
Aah! Aah!

1430
01:19:21,156 --> 01:19:22,891
Bastards.

1431
01:19:22,924 --> 01:19:24,392
You...

1432
01:19:40,142 --> 01:19:42,611
Shoot him! Oh!

1433
01:19:42,644 --> 01:19:45,247
I told you,
no shooting
in the apartment!

1434
01:19:45,280 --> 01:19:46,181
He's the one shooting!

1435
01:19:46,214 --> 01:19:48,550
Give me my money!

1436
01:19:48,583 --> 01:19:50,585
Max! Aah!

1437
01:19:56,324 --> 01:19:58,393
Piece: Ah, you...

1438
01:20:16,678 --> 01:20:18,346
Aah!

1439
01:20:18,380 --> 01:20:21,449
See this?
You see this?
This is a dead body!

1440
01:20:21,483 --> 01:20:22,584
That thing before--

1441
01:20:22,617 --> 01:20:24,152
that wasn't dead.
This is dead.

1442
01:20:24,186 --> 01:20:25,453
Don't blame this on me!

1443
01:20:25,487 --> 01:20:26,988
Don't!

1444
01:20:27,022 --> 01:20:28,990
Don't blame you?
You poisoned him.

1445
01:20:29,024 --> 01:20:31,193
Poison was
not my idea.

1446
01:20:31,226 --> 01:20:34,462
We couldn't have shots
in our apartment!
That was the whole idea!

1447
01:20:34,496 --> 01:20:36,264
Your!
Your apartment!

1448
01:20:36,298 --> 01:20:39,267
I no longer have
anything to do
with you,

1449
01:20:39,301 --> 01:20:41,469
with this place,
or any of this!

1450
01:20:41,503 --> 01:20:43,338
This time,
it's fuck you.

1451
01:20:43,371 --> 01:20:45,340
This is the end.
The end.

1452
01:20:45,373 --> 01:20:47,342
Jack: We have to leave
right now.

1453
01:20:47,375 --> 01:20:50,145
Right now, we have to go.
What do you want to do
with this, Max?

1454
01:20:50,178 --> 01:20:52,113
Fine.
Fuck you, too. Fine.

1455
01:20:52,147 --> 01:20:54,216
Max, leave it.

1456
01:20:54,249 --> 01:20:58,119
Forget about her.
Leave it or go. What
do you want to do?

1457
01:21:01,456 --> 01:21:02,691
Hmm?

1458
01:21:02,724 --> 01:21:06,328
We'll let the police
take care of it. Let
them earn their money.

1459
01:21:06,361 --> 01:21:08,129
I'll get something.

1460
01:21:08,163 --> 01:21:09,598
Good.

1461
01:21:12,667 --> 01:21:14,302
Is he here for me?

1462
01:21:14,336 --> 01:21:15,570
Go back to sleep!

1463
01:21:19,307 --> 01:21:21,443
Why did you
tell him? Why?

1464
01:21:21,476 --> 01:21:23,612
What the hell
did you do?

1465
01:21:23,645 --> 01:21:24,946
We
did. I just said it.

1466
01:21:24,980 --> 01:21:29,484
Now, you want to spend
the rest of your life
with this guy or not?

1467
01:21:29,517 --> 01:21:33,021
Make up your mind.
Let's go.

1468
01:21:41,029 --> 01:21:42,264
[Sniffs]

1469
01:22:07,322 --> 01:22:09,424
He's loading
piece's body
into the car.

1470
01:22:09,457 --> 01:22:11,426
Are we going
to do this?

1471
01:22:11,459 --> 01:22:14,429
Uh, are you
going to help me?

1472
01:22:16,164 --> 01:22:19,134
Right? Come on.

1473
01:22:19,167 --> 01:22:21,269
Pour 3 martinis.

1474
01:22:21,303 --> 01:22:23,571
3 martinis. 3.

1475
01:22:52,467 --> 01:22:55,437
Jack: Mmm, mmm, mmm.

1476
01:22:57,639 --> 01:22:59,474
You're
a fucking liar, Jack.

1477
01:22:59,507 --> 01:23:03,144
I don't know
what about, exactly,
but I know you are.

1478
01:23:03,178 --> 01:23:04,612
Why should I trust you?

1479
01:23:04,646 --> 01:23:06,481
Jamie, this whole thing
between you and Max

1480
01:23:06,514 --> 01:23:08,817
was set in motion way
before I ever met you.

1481
01:23:08,850 --> 01:23:11,319
I don't know if the part
I like about you is even
the real part.

1482
01:23:11,353 --> 01:23:13,355
I want you
to come with me
to San Francisco.

1483
01:23:13,388 --> 01:23:16,224
Why would I lie
to you about that?
What do I have to gain?

1484
01:23:16,257 --> 01:23:18,493
We can introduce
ourselves to each other
all over again, ok?

1485
01:23:18,526 --> 01:23:20,528
2 very nice,
very rich people

1486
01:23:20,562 --> 01:23:24,232
that never have to get
involved in crime
ever again, ok?

1487
01:23:31,873 --> 01:23:33,508
Then?

1488
01:23:33,541 --> 01:23:34,642
Then we'll see
what happens.

1489
01:23:34,676 --> 01:23:37,812
Ok. I'm going to go
and finish packing.

1490
01:23:37,846 --> 01:23:41,182
Make sure that he gets
the right one.

1491
01:23:41,216 --> 01:23:44,586
It's this one, ok?
This one. Ok?

1492
01:23:59,334 --> 01:24:01,603
What about this, Max?

1493
01:24:03,638 --> 01:24:06,574
Whose share is this
going to come out of?

1494
01:24:11,813 --> 01:24:16,151
It's her or me, right?
Right?

1495
01:24:17,218 --> 01:24:21,589
Never trust anything
that bleeds for 5 days
and doesn't die, right?

1496
01:24:24,893 --> 01:24:28,329
Jamie, come on.
We got to go. Let's go.

1497
01:24:33,868 --> 01:24:35,336
Let's have
our drinks,
then, huh?

1498
01:24:35,370 --> 01:24:37,839
All right. A toast.
To 3 very clever people.

1499
01:24:37,872 --> 01:24:40,475
May we--may we all get
what we deserve.

1500
01:24:40,508 --> 01:24:42,277
I loved you once,
sister Mary Agnes.

1501
01:24:42,310 --> 01:24:44,212
I loved you, too,
brother pio.

1502
01:24:44,245 --> 01:24:46,381
Wait. Stop.

1503
01:24:46,414 --> 01:24:48,383
Aah! Aah!

1505
01:24:50,785 --> 01:24:52,821
Jack, did you
switch glasses?

1506
01:24:56,558 --> 01:24:58,827
Oh, it hurts!

1507
01:25:16,578 --> 01:25:18,780
Well, we'd better go.

1508
01:25:20,482 --> 01:25:23,852
What did she mean
about switching
glasses?

1509
01:25:23,885 --> 01:25:26,421
I don't know.

1510
01:25:26,454 --> 01:25:29,724

some pretty stupid shit.

1511
01:25:29,757 --> 01:25:31,192
Huh?

1512
01:25:32,794 --> 01:25:36,898
Drink up, Max.
Let's go. We got to
get out of here.

1513
01:25:36,931 --> 01:25:38,666
I don't think so.

1514
01:25:42,937 --> 01:25:45,540
What was this?

1515
01:25:47,509 --> 01:25:51,646
Getting the money
is not enough?

1516
01:25:51,679 --> 01:25:53,915
Huh?

1517
01:25:53,948 --> 01:25:56,885
Nothing is enough
for people like you?

1518
01:25:56,918 --> 01:25:57,919
Nothing?!

Aww.

1523
01:26:15,703 --> 01:26:19,641
Come on. Come on,
you big fucking
piece of shit, huh?

1524
01:26:19,674 --> 01:26:22,343
Unh!

1525
01:26:22,377 --> 01:26:24,612
Oh, you're garbage.

1526

You're fucking garbage.

And you fucking smell
like garbage!

1528
01:26:30,451 --> 01:26:32,420
Come on.

1529
01:26:32,453 --> 01:26:34,422
That's ok. That's ok.

1530
01:26:34,455 --> 01:26:36,457
Get off my money!

1531
01:26:36,491 --> 01:26:38,359
You piece of shit.

1532
01:26:38,393 --> 01:26:41,796
I should have smelled you
a mile away.

1533
01:26:54,576 --> 01:26:56,878
I got played.

1534
01:26:58,079 --> 01:27:00,782
I got played!

1535
01:27:02,717 --> 01:27:05,019
I murdered sister Mary.

1536
01:27:05,053 --> 01:27:08,423
Jack: Why don't you get
away from her now, huh?

1537
01:27:08,456 --> 01:27:10,391
You're not
good enough for her.

1538
01:27:10,425 --> 01:27:12,560
Get off her!

1539
01:27:14,796 --> 01:27:17,699
Piece of shit.
You killed her.

1540
01:27:19,601 --> 01:27:21,336
And you're going to
walk away

1541
01:27:21,369 --> 01:27:23,805
with a lot of money
for it, aren't you?

1542
01:27:23,838 --> 01:27:27,675
Yeah. The money
is
nice...

1543
01:27:27,709 --> 01:27:31,412
But it's nothing compared
to the Spanish judges.

1544
01:27:31,446 --> 01:27:33,414
You have them?

1545
01:27:33,448 --> 01:27:35,450
No, Max.

1546
01:27:35,483 --> 01:27:37,285
You did.

1547
01:27:48,429 --> 01:27:49,897
You want
to see that, huh?

1548
01:27:49,931 --> 01:27:53,034
Huh? Want to see that?
Come on. Get over here.
Get over here.

You see that? Made

1550

in the galleries
of the louvre.

1551
01:27:56,938 --> 01:28:00,541
It was going
to be a present
for king Louis xv of France

1552
01:28:00,575 --> 01:28:02,810
to king Charles iv of Spain.

1553
01:28:02,844 --> 01:28:05,613
What does this say?
Look at that.

"Les juges"...
I can't speak French.

1555
01:28:08,483 --> 01:28:11,719
But they sure are pretty,
aren't they? Huh?

01:28:15,923 --> 01:28:18,092
Circa 1760.

1557
01:28:18,126 --> 01:28:20,895
Supposedly, Max,
these are one
of the finest sets

1558
01:28:20,928 --> 01:28:22,697
of dueling pistols
ever made.

1559
01:28:22,730 --> 01:28:24,766
Now, personally,
I don't like guns,

1560
01:28:24,799 --> 01:28:27,902
but I do know fine things
when I see them.

01:28:27,935 --> 01:28:29,904
Mmm, mmm, mmm.

1562
01:28:29,937 --> 01:28:32,440
The little story
I told you about--

1563
01:28:32,473 --> 01:28:35,109
remember the gentleman
in the motel parking lot?

1564
01:28:35,143 --> 01:28:38,446
Well, he'd sold
the guns by the time
we met with him,

1565
01:28:38,479 --> 01:28:39,947
sold them
on the black market,

1566
01:28:39,981 --> 01:28:41,883
and then he'd
sold them again
and again and again...

1567
01:28:41,916 --> 01:28:44,452
For a fraction
of their worth.

1568
01:28:44,485 --> 01:28:47,088
One million dollars.
Oh, my god.

1569
01:28:47,121 --> 01:28:49,457
Hidden this entire time

1570
01:28:49,490 --> 01:28:52,593
in a graveyard
of a fucking apartment.

1571
01:28:52,627 --> 01:28:54,762
What a joke, Max.

1572
01:28:54,796 --> 01:28:57,832
How many
pretty sister Marys
you have to kill

1573
01:28:57,865 --> 01:28:59,600
for a million bucks, huh?

1574
01:29:06,874 --> 01:29:08,609
Max: You think
you know

1575
01:29:08,643 --> 01:29:10,945
who I am, Jack?

1576
01:29:10,978 --> 01:29:13,581
You haven't even
met me yet.

1577
01:29:13,614 --> 01:29:15,550
Max?

1578
01:29:15,583 --> 01:29:16,851
Yes?

1579
01:29:16,884 --> 01:29:19,887
When you were
showing me
the pistols...

1580
01:29:19,921 --> 01:29:22,123
You only loaded
one of them.

1581
01:29:28,763 --> 01:29:31,132
Do you remember
which one it was?

1582
01:29:32,734 --> 01:29:35,603
No.

1583
01:29:35,636 --> 01:29:38,106
Well...

1584
01:29:38,139 --> 01:29:41,843
There's only one way
to find out.

1585
01:29:41,876 --> 01:29:43,111
[Click]

1586
01:29:46,881 --> 01:29:48,983
Shit.

1587
01:29:52,754 --> 01:29:56,124
This is a 200-year-old
gun, Jack.

1588
01:29:56,157 --> 01:29:59,127
I wonder what this gun
would do to you.

1589
01:29:59,160 --> 01:30:01,195
Think it'd kill you
instantly?

1590
01:30:01,229 --> 01:30:04,732
Or maybe it would
just wound you, hmm?

1591
01:30:04,766 --> 01:30:09,070
I could watch you bleed
and squirm all night,

1592
01:30:09,103 --> 01:30:11,038
like you've been doing
to Jamie and I.

1593
01:30:11,072 --> 01:30:13,741
You fuck.

1594
01:30:13,775 --> 01:30:17,011
You fu--
you fucking cheap whore.

1595
01:30:18,579 --> 01:30:20,214
Get down on your knees!

1596
01:30:20,248 --> 01:30:23,918
Get down
on your fucking knees!

1597
01:30:23,951 --> 01:30:28,055
You beg Jamie
to forgive you. Beg her!

1598
01:30:28,089 --> 01:30:30,625
Mars girl: Fly! Fly!

1599
01:30:50,711 --> 01:30:53,247
What's
happening?

1600
01:30:56,117 --> 01:30:58,186
Nothing, honey.

1601
01:31:01,923 --> 01:31:04,158
Excuse me, Max.

1602
01:31:05,760 --> 01:31:07,962
Come on.

1603
01:31:07,995 --> 01:31:09,664
Is he here
for me?

1604
01:31:09,697 --> 01:31:11,999
No, he's not here.
I got to tell you
something, all right?

1605
01:31:12,033 --> 01:31:14,001
Listen to me, honey.
Come with me, all right?

1606
01:31:14,035 --> 01:31:16,003
I can't leave you here.
You know too much.

1607
01:31:16,037 --> 01:31:18,539
As soon as we get
outside of the city,
I'll let you go.

1608
01:31:18,573 --> 01:31:20,208
I'll even give you
some money, all right?

1609
01:31:20,241 --> 01:31:21,876
Go anywhere you want.
Come on.

1610
01:31:21,909 --> 01:31:24,912
No, thank you.
I have to wait here
for the man from Mars.

1611
01:31:24,946 --> 01:31:27,582
I'm the man from Mars.
Hey, I couldn't
tell you before,

1612
01:31:27,615 --> 01:31:29,784
because they would
all have gotten
very jealous,

1613
01:31:29,817 --> 01:31:32,253
but I'm that guy.
Come with me.
You're not, though.

1614
01:31:32,286 --> 01:31:34,322
Why,
because I got scars?
Everyone's got scars.

1615
01:31:34,355 --> 01:31:38,826
No. They know what to do
so their scars
all heal up,

1616
01:31:38,860 --> 01:31:41,229
but yours just keep on
getting worse.

1617
01:31:43,030 --> 01:31:44,699
There's no man
from Mars.

1618
01:31:44,732 --> 01:31:47,001
He's not coming.
The only people that
are coming are the cops,

1619
01:31:47,034 --> 01:31:49,003
and you can't be here.
You know too much.

1620
01:31:49,036 --> 01:31:51,272
So tell me
you're going to come
with me, all right?

1621
01:31:51,305 --> 01:31:52,974
No.

1622
01:31:53,007 --> 01:31:55,643
Come on.
Give me a big hug. Yeah.

1623
01:31:55,676 --> 01:31:57,144
[Giggles]

1624
01:31:57,178 --> 01:32:00,648
Please don't
make me do something
shitty here, ok?

1625
01:32:00,681 --> 01:32:03,284
So tell me
you'll come with me.

1626
01:32:03,317 --> 01:32:04,785
No.

1627
01:32:04,819 --> 01:32:06,287
[Giggling]

1628
01:32:06,320 --> 01:32:09,123
I will do this,
I swear. Please?

1629
01:32:09,156 --> 01:32:11,592
Tell me you'll come
with me.

1630
01:32:16,097 --> 01:32:17,999
Let go of me.

1631
01:32:18,032 --> 01:32:19,700
[Crack]

1632
01:32:19,734 --> 01:32:20,968
[Giggling stops]

1633
01:33:18,993 --> 01:33:20,928
[Police siren]

1634
01:33:38,779 --> 01:33:40,715
[Tires screech]

1635
01:33:52,760 --> 01:33:54,028
[Shouting]

1636
01:34:05,106 --> 01:34:06,741
[Shouting]

1637
01:34:15,816 --> 01:34:17,785
[Pounding on door]

1638
01:34:17,818 --> 01:34:19,887
Policeman:
Open up! Police!

1639
01:34:21,389 --> 01:34:23,724
Police!
Open the door!

1640
01:34:25,292 --> 01:34:27,962
Police! Open the door now!

1641
01:34:34,802 --> 01:34:38,205
