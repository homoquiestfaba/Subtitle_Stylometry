[Battle cry]

3
00:03:17,164 --> 00:03:18,532
Die, barbarian pig.

4
00:03:34,748 --> 00:03:36,850
Leave this land
and never return.

5
00:06:22,883 --> 00:06:24,284
Doran?

6
00:06:24,384 --> 00:06:25,252
Doran, is that you?

7
00:06:34,862 --> 00:06:36,229
Who goes there?

8
00:06:36,329 --> 00:06:37,731
Be you friend or foe?

9
00:06:53,313 --> 00:06:54,214
Show yourself, coward.

10
00:07:01,789 --> 00:07:03,691
Show yourself and do battle.

11
00:08:17,631 --> 00:08:19,232
[Battle cry]

12
00:08:23,103 --> 00:08:26,006
[Man laughing]

13
00:09:26,867 --> 00:09:29,770
The amulet, it is not
protecting me from harm.

14
00:09:34,808 --> 00:09:35,909
It knows you are safe.

15
00:09:36,009 --> 00:09:36,710
Doran.

16
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:46,019
You know nothing of honor.

17
00:09:46,119 --> 00:09:50,824
All is fair in love and
in war, my sweet Doran.

18
00:09:50,924 --> 00:09:53,060
Now, the war is over.

19
00:10:00,167 --> 00:10:03,136
Our bond is strong, my beloved.

20
00:10:03,236 --> 00:10:05,138
I do love you.

21
00:10:05,238 --> 00:10:07,107
I, too, love thee.

22
00:10:07,207 --> 00:10:10,077
We shall always be
together, for eternity.

23
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:38,271
Doran, I'm worried
for our people.

24
00:10:38,371 --> 00:10:42,242
There's so much evil
and pain in the land.

25
00:10:42,342 --> 00:10:44,611
Thieves grow from every
tree and every stream.

26
00:10:47,347 --> 00:10:49,349
The land is pure.

27
00:10:49,449 --> 00:10:53,353
It is the hearts of
men that are evil.

28
00:10:53,453 --> 00:10:56,523
This amulet shall
protect you from harm.

29
00:11:02,095 --> 00:11:04,664
Power and strength fill me.

30
00:11:04,765 --> 00:11:07,434
It is as if I, too,
am a great warrior.

31
00:11:07,534 --> 00:11:09,669
Lystra, beware its power.

32
00:11:09,770 --> 00:11:12,639
The Wizard made this
known to my grandfather.

33
00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:17,144
Perhaps this wizard is
but a tale from your head.

34
00:11:17,244 --> 00:11:19,747
Wizards are not to
be taken in jest,

35
00:11:19,847 --> 00:11:24,584
But be posessed of powers of
the heavens and the underworld.

36
00:11:24,684 --> 00:11:26,653
Where is this wizard,
then, and why does he

37
00:11:26,754 --> 00:11:28,088
Not show his face to me?

38
00:11:28,188 --> 00:11:35,628
He shows his face to none,
and he is a she, showing only

39
00:11:35,729 --> 00:11:38,631
Her face to those she chooses.

40
00:11:44,704 --> 00:11:47,607
A she?

41
00:11:47,707 --> 00:11:52,112
My grandfather told me the
story when I was a young boy.

42
00:11:52,212 --> 00:11:56,817
She appeared before his eyes
to save him from certain death.

43
00:11:56,917 --> 00:12:02,222
He vowed never to lost
sight of the amulet.

44
00:12:02,322 --> 00:12:05,225
And so it has been
bequeathed to me.

45
00:12:05,325 --> 00:12:10,163
My vow is to use its power
to protect my people,

46
00:12:10,263 --> 00:12:14,234
To teach them honesty and
bravery, to seek the truth.

47
00:12:14,334 --> 00:12:17,170
And if this is done,
then the people of Armana

48
00:12:17,270 --> 00:12:20,273
Shall be protected by its power.

49
00:12:20,373 --> 00:12:23,176
So you have done.

50
00:12:23,276 --> 00:12:25,512
They worship you, Doran.

51
00:12:25,612 --> 00:12:30,617
Worship is not what I
seek, for I am not a god.

52
00:12:30,717 --> 00:12:35,122
All I ask is that they
listen and follow.

53
00:12:35,222 --> 00:12:36,656
Their lives, then,
are their own.

54
00:12:43,030 --> 00:12:44,297
You become wiser with each day.

55
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:51,504
I am honored to be your queen.

56
00:12:51,604 --> 00:12:54,307
My grandfather gave
me fair warning.

57
00:12:54,407 --> 00:12:58,378
And you, too, must beware
its power, for with a thought

58
00:12:58,478 --> 00:13:01,548
One can travel great
journeys to lands

59
00:13:01,648 --> 00:13:08,021
Never seen by thine eyes, a
land where one may never return.

60
00:13:08,121 --> 00:13:10,657
So dream not of lands
other than this, or you

61
00:13:10,757 --> 00:13:12,259
Shall leave me forever.

62
00:13:15,562 --> 00:13:18,465
The power shall make
us great warriors.

63
00:13:18,565 --> 00:13:20,834
And with it, we shall build
a new world for our children.

64
00:13:23,536 --> 00:13:26,106
[Music playing]

65
00:15:11,278 --> 00:15:14,147
[Imitating bird sound]

66
00:15:22,422 --> 00:15:23,123
Bartaga.

67
00:15:39,672 --> 00:15:41,074
Kiss me, great warrior.

68
00:15:41,174 --> 00:15:42,009
Kiss me.

69
00:15:42,109 --> 00:15:44,744
I have come to
hunt with my king.

70
00:15:44,844 --> 00:15:47,080
I have no time for
sexual foolishness.

71
00:15:51,451 --> 00:15:56,990
Doran, my friend, today
is ripe for the hunt.

72
00:15:57,090 --> 00:15:59,259
And so your wine shall speak.

73
00:15:59,359 --> 00:16:01,528
She would make a great
wife for a warrior

74
00:16:01,628 --> 00:16:03,830
For her bravery is more
than most men possess.

75
00:16:03,930 --> 00:16:07,167
Bartaga is a
warrior, not a lover.

76
00:16:07,267 --> 00:16:09,936
And I, my friend, am both.

77
00:17:16,169 --> 00:17:19,972
Perhaps the boar are better
than a woman's tongue.

78
00:17:20,073 --> 00:17:23,843
Yes, but what will
keep you warm at night?

79
00:17:23,943 --> 00:17:26,313
[Inaudible] hunter.

80
00:17:26,413 --> 00:17:28,781
[Laughter]

81
00:17:30,350 --> 00:17:32,285
And it does not
screech in my ear.

82
00:17:59,279 --> 00:17:59,946
Oh.

83
00:18:12,225 --> 00:18:12,925
Oh.

84
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:29,342
[Magical twinkling]

85
00:18:46,393 --> 00:18:48,261
Mandrak.

86
00:18:48,361 --> 00:18:49,762
Mandrak.

87
00:18:49,862 --> 00:18:54,367
I found a treasure, an
amulet of great wealth.

88
00:18:54,467 --> 00:18:55,168
Oh.

89
00:18:59,172 --> 00:19:00,540
Where?

90
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:04,544
A woman holds it,
a barbarian queen.

91
00:19:04,644 --> 00:19:08,014
Her name is Lystra.

92
00:19:08,114 --> 00:19:12,519
Lystra, the warrior's woman?

93
00:19:12,619 --> 00:19:14,921
He warned us never to return.

94
00:19:15,021 --> 00:19:15,922
We should go back.

95
00:19:16,022 --> 00:19:17,123
Where is she?

96
00:19:17,224 --> 00:19:20,593
By the stream at the edge
of the forest, not far.

97
00:19:20,693 --> 00:19:22,028
They'll be sure to
kill us if we go there.

98
00:19:22,128 --> 00:19:23,930
Coward.

99
00:19:24,030 --> 00:19:28,401
She's very beautiful,
Mandrak, a tasty

100
00:19:28,501 --> 00:19:31,904
Tidbit for a hungry man.

101
00:19:32,004 --> 00:19:34,841
She's [inaudible].

102
00:19:34,941 --> 00:19:36,075
He swore that if
we ever came back...

103
00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:38,545
Silence!

104
00:19:38,645 --> 00:19:42,048
Take me to her.

105
00:19:42,148 --> 00:19:45,051
That amulet will
make us all rich men.

106
00:19:52,124 --> 00:19:54,026
Ah, Lystra.

107
00:20:45,512 --> 00:20:49,416
If a man truly loves a woman,
he will never leave her.

108
00:20:49,516 --> 00:20:53,420
But you must have a tree, for
your man must leave to hunt

109
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:55,888
Or you shall go hungry.

110
00:20:55,988 --> 00:20:58,758
You two speak with idle words.

111
00:20:58,858 --> 00:21:01,227
If I had a man like Doran,
he could leave for years,

112
00:21:01,328 --> 00:21:03,229
And I would wait for him.

113
00:21:03,330 --> 00:21:06,232
But you do not
have him, do you?

114
00:21:06,333 --> 00:21:08,701
Only Lystra has
that good fortune.

115
00:21:19,946 --> 00:21:20,647
There.

116
00:21:25,251 --> 00:21:26,152
[Whispering]

117
00:21:26,252 --> 00:21:28,120
Are you mad?

118
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:30,623
Silence, Wolf.

119
00:21:30,723 --> 00:21:33,593
You give me the women, or
I'll cut your tongues out.

120
00:21:33,693 --> 00:21:39,098
There are no men that I
can see, just women and us.

121
00:21:43,670 --> 00:21:46,573
[Quiet laughter]

122
00:22:06,092 --> 00:22:10,062
Do thoughts of
sadness fill your head?

123
00:22:10,162 --> 00:22:11,898
It is nothing, my lady.

124
00:22:11,998 --> 00:22:16,469
Surely it is something, for
I can see it in your eyes.

125
00:22:16,569 --> 00:22:19,472
I cannot hide from you.

126
00:22:19,572 --> 00:22:20,940
You see into my very soul.

127
00:22:23,976 --> 00:22:25,378
It is Bartaga.

128
00:22:25,478 --> 00:22:27,013
He does not even
know that I am alive.

129
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:37,890
A man such as Bartaga
has a duty to himself

130
00:22:37,990 --> 00:22:39,892
Before he can be with a woman.

131
00:22:39,992 --> 00:22:46,399
He just needs to see the magic
inside you that he is missing.

132
00:22:46,499 --> 00:22:48,668
You are right.

133
00:22:48,768 --> 00:22:50,202
I am worthy.

134
00:22:50,302 --> 00:22:52,705
It is he who has
not opened his eyes.

135
00:22:57,276 --> 00:22:59,679
[Laughter]

136
00:23:17,196 --> 00:23:19,599
[Yelling]

137
00:23:19,699 --> 00:23:22,569
[Screaming]

138
00:23:49,562 --> 00:23:50,463
She's only a woman.

139
00:24:17,957 --> 00:24:19,358
Come now, barbarian.

140
00:24:19,458 --> 00:24:21,360
You can do better than that.

141
00:24:44,851 --> 00:24:45,752
Now, die.

142
00:25:07,506 --> 00:25:08,207
Doran.

143
00:25:11,377 --> 00:25:12,078
Doran.

144
00:25:16,583 --> 00:25:19,285
Oh, my head.

145
00:25:19,385 --> 00:25:21,420
Nothing my wine cannot cure.

146
00:25:25,057 --> 00:25:28,127
Lystra, she's in danger.

147
00:25:28,227 --> 00:25:28,928
Come on.

148
00:25:55,287 --> 00:25:59,225
The wife of the great warrior
Doran, the mightiest barbarian

149
00:25:59,325 --> 00:26:00,126
Of them all.

150
00:26:00,226 --> 00:26:01,994
Ha!

151
00:26:02,094 --> 00:26:03,996
Where is he now?

152
00:26:04,096 --> 00:26:05,965
How shall he save you?

153
00:26:10,069 --> 00:26:14,440
Will he even want you after
I am finished with you?

154
00:26:14,540 --> 00:26:18,945
You shall die by his sword.

155
00:26:19,045 --> 00:26:19,912
No, no.

156
00:26:29,989 --> 00:26:32,058
No.

157
00:26:32,158 --> 00:26:32,859
No.

158
00:26:39,431 --> 00:26:40,332
No.

159
00:26:40,432 --> 00:26:41,533
No.

160
00:26:41,634 --> 00:26:42,334
Doran!

161
00:27:33,419 --> 00:27:35,722
Do you not like the touch of
cold steel upon your cheek?

162
00:27:38,758 --> 00:27:42,094
On your body?

163
00:27:42,194 --> 00:27:45,798
Was it not as you
expected, barbarian queen?

164
00:27:59,411 --> 00:28:02,849
Mandrak, we must leave
before Doran finds us,

165
00:28:02,949 --> 00:28:03,816
Or we're doomed.

166
00:28:03,916 --> 00:28:05,584
Doomed?

167
00:28:05,684 --> 00:28:06,719
I will show you doomed.

168
00:29:29,836 --> 00:29:35,674
Oh, I felt her spirit
pass through me.

169
00:29:35,774 --> 00:29:39,645
It is as if I
possess a new life.

170
00:29:43,249 --> 00:29:46,652
I have heard many
wondrous tales,

171
00:29:46,752 --> 00:29:49,188
And now you will
make me a rich man.

172
00:29:52,258 --> 00:29:54,126
Make us rich, Mandrak.

173
00:30:10,576 --> 00:30:12,845
Tell me more of
the amulet's powers.

174
00:30:12,945 --> 00:30:13,645
More?

175
00:30:13,745 --> 00:30:14,780
Tell me.

176
00:30:14,881 --> 00:30:18,885
I must know, or you will
die by my sword, jackal.

177
00:30:18,985 --> 00:30:21,387
It has the power
of the heavens,

178
00:30:21,487 --> 00:30:25,791
Master, the spirits of the
underworld, cursed strength.

179
00:30:25,892 --> 00:30:26,725
It is said that...

180
00:30:26,825 --> 00:30:28,127
Do you take me for a fool?

181
00:30:28,227 --> 00:30:31,864
No, Mandrak, no,
it is the truth.

182
00:30:31,964 --> 00:30:34,901
You know as well
as I. That crystal

183
00:30:35,001 --> 00:30:37,703
Protects Doran and his people.

184
00:30:37,803 --> 00:30:41,340
It could bring us a
talent of gold coins.

185
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:52,551
It will bring more
than that, [inaudible].

186
00:30:52,651 --> 00:30:56,522
It will bring me
my salvation, what

187
00:30:56,622 --> 00:30:59,591
I have desired all my life!

188
00:31:25,584 --> 00:31:26,252
No.

189
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:42,568
No.

190
00:31:42,668 --> 00:31:43,369
No!

191
00:31:43,469 --> 00:31:44,370
[Lamenting]

192
00:31:55,047 --> 00:31:57,283
Prisal.

193
00:31:57,383 --> 00:31:58,084
Prisal.

194
00:32:05,091 --> 00:32:08,460
Who did this to you?

195
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:11,130
Mandrak.

196
00:32:11,230 --> 00:32:11,930
Mandrak?

197
00:32:17,003 --> 00:32:18,704
My prize of battle.

198
00:32:42,661 --> 00:32:44,530
They did not die
without a fight.

199
00:32:47,599 --> 00:32:51,970
He... he did this to my beloved.

200
00:32:52,071 --> 00:32:54,773
I'll kill him
with my bare hands.

201
00:32:54,873 --> 00:32:55,841
I swear, Doran.

202
00:32:55,941 --> 00:32:56,642
No.

203
00:32:59,411 --> 00:33:01,813
It is I who must
avenge her death.

204
00:34:31,570 --> 00:34:36,442
I will not rest
until Mandrak dies.

205
00:34:36,542 --> 00:34:38,944
I swear to you this.

206
00:34:49,488 --> 00:34:52,891
Your thoughts must
be clear for battle.

207
00:34:52,991 --> 00:34:55,827
My thoughts were clear
before you did that.

208
00:34:55,927 --> 00:34:57,796
Come, we have no time.

209
00:34:57,896 --> 00:35:00,866
Since my thoughts are
clear, what of the amulet?

210
00:35:00,966 --> 00:35:03,135
Did not the Wizard give
your ancestors fair warning

211
00:35:03,235 --> 00:35:04,603
Never to lose sight of it?

212
00:35:04,703 --> 00:35:05,871
You speak the truth.

213
00:35:05,971 --> 00:35:07,539
Will she not be a little angry?

214
00:35:07,639 --> 00:35:08,707
It is I who lost the amulet.

215
00:35:08,807 --> 00:35:10,176
It is I who must have to pay.

216
00:35:10,276 --> 00:35:11,643
It was not you, my friend.

217
00:35:11,743 --> 00:35:14,846
It was Lystra who
lost the amulet.

218
00:35:14,946 --> 00:35:17,916
Surely the Wizard will look
upon this with a fair eye.

219
00:35:18,016 --> 00:35:20,252
I have no fear of death.

220
00:35:20,352 --> 00:35:26,858
A brave warrior, indeed...
Who, then, will I hunt with?

221
00:35:26,958 --> 00:35:31,930
When the Wizard finds us,
we may never hunt again.

222
00:35:32,030 --> 00:35:35,867
I will stand by your
side, Wizard or no Wizard.

223
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:37,229
[Birds calling]

224
00:36:39,331 --> 00:36:43,935
Birds, only birds.

225
00:36:44,035 --> 00:36:44,736
Come.

226
00:36:44,836 --> 00:36:46,204
We must not stop.

227
00:36:54,313 --> 00:36:57,182
[Birds calling angrily]

228
00:37:26,745 --> 00:37:31,116
[Inaudible] I have awaited
this day, barbarian.

229
00:37:31,216 --> 00:37:32,618
You die.

230
00:37:32,718 --> 00:37:34,620
[Battle cry]

231
00:37:36,221 --> 00:37:37,122
[Men shouting]

232
00:37:37,222 --> 00:37:37,923
Stay back.

233
00:39:43,649 --> 00:39:44,349
No!

234
00:40:03,435 --> 00:40:06,304
[Crazy laughter]

235
00:40:16,882 --> 00:40:19,951
[Howling]

236
00:41:13,071 --> 00:41:15,206
[Laughter]

237
00:41:15,306 --> 00:41:19,678
You are a brave one.

238
00:41:19,778 --> 00:41:21,446
What do they call you?

239
00:41:21,547 --> 00:41:23,782
Doran.

240
00:41:23,882 --> 00:41:25,350
Doran.

241
00:41:25,450 --> 00:41:26,484
[Laughter]

242
00:41:26,585 --> 00:41:29,120
The King of Armana?

243
00:41:29,220 --> 00:41:32,457
Were you lost in the
forest like all of them?

244
00:41:38,396 --> 00:41:41,399
He dies by my sword.

245
00:41:41,499 --> 00:41:43,234
Moltar would be pleased.

246
00:42:27,979 --> 00:42:29,848
Psst.

247
00:42:29,948 --> 00:42:31,850
Psst, barbarian.

248
00:42:35,420 --> 00:42:39,390
I know who you are.

249
00:42:39,490 --> 00:42:43,028
Caught you the same way
they caught me, I wager.

250
00:42:43,128 --> 00:42:46,331
What are you doing
in these parts?

251
00:42:46,431 --> 00:42:49,234
I'm searching for a murderer.

252
00:42:49,334 --> 00:42:50,035
Murderer?

253
00:42:53,004 --> 00:42:55,340
Got plenty of 'em right here.

254
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:59,477
Bloodthirsty vermin, they are.

255
00:42:59,577 --> 00:43:03,949
That one, watch out for him.

256
00:43:04,049 --> 00:43:07,418
He'd just as soon rip the
heart right out of you if you

257
00:43:07,518 --> 00:43:08,920
Look at him the wrong way.

258
00:43:09,020 --> 00:43:11,923
[Men laughing and whooping]

259
00:43:59,337 --> 00:44:07,178
Moltar, god of the underworld,
I send to you this sacrifice

260
00:44:07,278 --> 00:44:10,181
Of flesh and blood.

261
00:44:10,281 --> 00:44:13,151
[Cheering]

262
00:44:37,175 --> 00:44:42,781
Tonight, you meet Moltar,
and I have the honor.

263
00:44:48,153 --> 00:44:50,722
Strip him to the skin.

264
00:44:50,822 --> 00:44:53,591
[Laughter]

265
00:45:41,672 --> 00:45:44,375
Why do you look so
surprised, barbarian?

266
00:45:44,475 --> 00:45:47,278
Have you never seen
a wizard before?

267
00:45:47,378 --> 00:45:49,747
You are the Wizard?

268
00:45:49,848 --> 00:45:52,818
I have heard only tales.

269
00:45:52,918 --> 00:45:54,485
You must hide
before they see you.

270
00:45:54,585 --> 00:45:58,256
They cannot see me.

271
00:45:58,356 --> 00:46:00,826
Wizard, free me.

272
00:46:00,926 --> 00:46:02,527
Free you?

273
00:46:02,627 --> 00:46:04,462
Why should I do that?

274
00:46:07,966 --> 00:46:13,204
You are a healthy-looking
mortal, aren't you?

275
00:46:13,304 --> 00:46:18,643
It is a pity, being
captured by these heathens.

276
00:46:18,743 --> 00:46:20,245
Where is my crystal amulet?

277
00:46:23,381 --> 00:46:24,149
I lost it.

278
00:46:24,249 --> 00:46:24,950
You lost it?

279
00:46:27,886 --> 00:46:30,321
I saved your grandfather's life.

280
00:46:30,421 --> 00:46:34,059
I gave him that amulet in the
hopes that one day one... one

281
00:46:34,159 --> 00:46:37,595
Man in this putrid land would...
Would set an example of honor.

282
00:46:37,695 --> 00:46:39,530
And all you can
say is you lost it.

283
00:46:43,268 --> 00:46:46,337
That amulet was to protect his
descendants for many lifetimes.

284
00:46:46,437 --> 00:46:49,407
You have broken
the chain, Doran.

285
00:46:49,507 --> 00:46:51,109
So kill me now and
be done with it.

286
00:46:51,209 --> 00:46:52,844
I do not deserve to live.

287
00:46:52,944 --> 00:46:56,747
Oh, you are quick
to die, barbarian.

288
00:46:56,848 --> 00:46:58,917
To kill you would be too easy.

289
00:46:59,017 --> 00:47:02,220
To kill you would not replace
my amulet, now would it?

290
00:47:02,320 --> 00:47:03,521
It has been with
me for centuries.

291
00:47:06,257 --> 00:47:13,598
Your from this day forward is
to return the amulet to me.

292
00:47:13,698 --> 00:47:17,969
If you do not, then I shall be
forced to curse your people.

293
00:47:21,106 --> 00:47:23,208
You leave my
people out of this.

294
00:47:23,308 --> 00:47:27,112
If you fail to
return it, then I

295
00:47:27,212 --> 00:47:32,117
Shall cast an evil and wicked
plague over your tribe.

296
00:47:32,217 --> 00:47:34,119
They will burn with
hatred and disease

297
00:47:34,219 --> 00:47:36,154
Upon hearing Doran's name.

298
00:47:36,254 --> 00:47:37,956
This is not my people's fault.

299
00:47:38,056 --> 00:47:40,825
Their wounds festering
from their hate

300
00:47:40,926 --> 00:47:42,393
For their king... oh, yes!

301
00:47:45,196 --> 00:47:46,898
You will find the amulet.

302
00:47:46,998 --> 00:47:48,433
You will find the
man that belongs

303
00:47:48,533 --> 00:47:53,271
To that hand on your belt. The
man you seek is in this world

304
00:47:53,371 --> 00:47:55,406
No longer.

305
00:47:55,506 --> 00:47:59,110
You must travel to
another time to find him.

306
00:47:59,210 --> 00:48:05,583
You must travel to a
land called the future.

307
00:48:05,683 --> 00:48:08,586
It is very different
than the forest.

308
00:48:08,686 --> 00:48:10,088
It is tomorrow's tomorrow.

309
00:48:10,188 --> 00:48:13,191
But if you are quick of wit
and brave of heart and fight

310
00:48:13,291 --> 00:48:15,961
With honor you may triumph.

311
00:48:16,061 --> 00:48:19,764
But you must return
the amulet to me.

312
00:48:19,864 --> 00:48:25,403
Mandrak has the amulet, and it
will make him a mighty warrior.

313
00:48:25,503 --> 00:48:28,806
The amulet has no power in
the hands of evil, Doran.

314
00:48:28,906 --> 00:48:33,144
Only in the presence
of honor and of a king

315
00:48:33,244 --> 00:48:39,684
With a noble heart does
it have such magic.

316
00:48:39,784 --> 00:48:40,485
Behold.

317
00:48:46,891 --> 00:48:48,259
A sword.

318
00:48:48,359 --> 00:48:50,795
It will take you
to your destination.

319
00:48:50,895 --> 00:48:54,165
And for the love of
gods, do not lose it.

320
00:48:54,265 --> 00:48:54,966
Enough chatter.

321
00:48:58,203 --> 00:48:59,270
Be free, barbarian.

322
00:49:03,641 --> 00:49:05,977
And heed this as
your last warning.

323
00:50:03,634 --> 00:50:08,906
Your evil shall
end by my hands.

324
00:50:38,169 --> 00:50:40,971
Penny, please, when are
you gonna listen to me?

325
00:50:41,072 --> 00:50:41,839
I'm telling you.

326
00:50:41,939 --> 00:50:42,940
You're asking for trouble.

327
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:43,741
Trust me on this.

328
00:50:43,841 --> 00:50:45,943
Brice, just chill out.

329
00:50:46,043 --> 00:50:47,478
Turn the camera
on, and no matter

330
00:50:47,578 --> 00:50:51,182
What, just keep it rolling.

331
00:50:51,282 --> 00:50:53,418
Cogs will have a brick
when he sees this.

332
00:50:56,053 --> 00:50:57,622
Just remember, this
is all your idea.

333
00:51:13,538 --> 00:51:15,072
Rolling.

334
00:51:15,173 --> 00:51:18,476
I'm Penny Price,
Channel 5 Action News,

335
00:51:18,576 --> 00:51:21,045
Reporting to you from the site
of a gang-related shooting

336
00:51:21,146 --> 00:51:23,481
Which occurred earlier
today behind me.

337
00:51:23,581 --> 00:51:26,117
Apparently, the warehouse
owner was threatened

338
00:51:26,217 --> 00:51:28,753
To pay for what the street
gang, The Gladiators,

339
00:51:28,853 --> 00:51:32,423
Calls safety insurance,
which means he pays

340
00:51:32,523 --> 00:51:35,059
The gangs large sums
of money to stop

341
00:51:35,160 --> 00:51:37,795
Them from destroying his door.

342
00:51:37,895 --> 00:51:42,400
Well, as you can see, he didn't
make this week's payment.

343
00:51:42,500 --> 00:51:46,337
This is just one gang-related
incident in over 239

344
00:51:46,437 --> 00:51:48,773
That have happened in
our city this year.

345
00:51:48,873 --> 00:51:52,377
What I would like to know is
whatever happened to morals,

346
00:51:52,477 --> 00:51:55,045
Ethics, and common decency?

347
00:51:55,146 --> 00:51:59,484
What we need is a positive role
model, a hero you might say,

348
00:51:59,584 --> 00:52:01,752
Who could rally the
citizens to take

349
00:52:01,852 --> 00:52:03,254
Action and make a difference.

350
00:52:07,292 --> 00:52:09,160
Hey, everybody, I'm on TV.

351
00:52:19,804 --> 00:52:20,505
Penny!

352
00:52:26,043 --> 00:52:27,445
You sons of bitches.

353
00:52:27,545 --> 00:52:28,913
Let go of me.

354
00:52:29,013 --> 00:52:29,914
Come on, guys.

355
00:52:34,151 --> 00:52:34,852
The witch.

356
00:52:34,952 --> 00:52:35,653
Find the witch.

357
00:52:42,860 --> 00:52:45,230
What do you want with me?

358
00:52:45,330 --> 00:52:49,234
You know, every time me
and my pals turn on the TV,

359
00:52:49,334 --> 00:52:52,970
There you are, giving us
a bad rap, Penny Price.

360
00:52:53,070 --> 00:52:54,205
Consider this a warning.

361
00:53:00,778 --> 00:53:02,647
Penny, I'm coming!

362
00:53:07,752 --> 00:53:09,620
[Inaudible] keep
this camera rolling.

363

[Thunder]

364
00:53:23,668 --> 00:53:24,569
Who is out here?

365
00:53:31,642 --> 00:53:33,043
Free her.

366
00:53:33,143 --> 00:53:36,013
What is this shit?

367
00:53:36,113 --> 00:53:39,717
Get him, Crank, find out.

368
00:53:39,817 --> 00:53:40,518
[Inaudible].

369
00:53:48,293 --> 00:53:51,161
[Laughter]

370
00:53:53,230 --> 00:53:54,632
You gotta be kidding.

371
00:54:03,140 --> 00:54:04,509
Go on, kill the fuck.

372
00:54:11,749 --> 00:54:12,450
Go on.

373
00:54:25,596 --> 00:54:26,297
Get up.

374
00:54:26,397 --> 00:54:27,298
Get up, [inaudible].

375
00:54:30,368 --> 00:54:31,502
Your swords match your manhood.

376
00:54:37,274 --> 00:54:38,576
You take him, Swank.

377
00:54:38,676 --> 00:54:39,744
- What?
- Bye.

378
00:54:39,844 --> 00:54:40,545
Hey.

379
00:54:44,615 --> 00:54:45,516
You suck.

380
00:55:09,474 --> 00:55:11,376
Now that you're
finished changing,

381
00:55:11,476 --> 00:55:14,345
Can we get back to the station?

382
00:55:14,445 --> 00:55:17,348
He looks like he's never
even seen a fence before.

383
00:55:20,918 --> 00:55:22,887
So what's the big deal?

384
00:55:22,987 --> 00:55:23,688
He's probably a convict.

385
00:55:23,788 --> 00:55:24,522
Look at him.

386
00:55:24,622 --> 00:55:26,991
He could be dangerous, Penny.

387
00:55:27,091 --> 00:55:28,459
He saved my life, Brice.

388
00:55:32,997 --> 00:55:37,835
Look, we've got a deadline, and
you're worried about this guy?

389
00:55:37,935 --> 00:55:39,303
I don't believe it.

390
00:55:42,840 --> 00:55:47,678
Penny, please, we gotta get back
to the station, so let's go.

391
00:55:50,615 --> 00:55:53,818
Just go without me, Brice.

392
00:55:53,918 --> 00:55:55,453
What?

393
00:55:55,553 --> 00:55:56,854
Look, go without me.

394
00:55:56,954 --> 00:55:58,288
Tell Cogs I got tied up.

395
00:55:58,389 --> 00:55:59,490
All you need is the tape, right?

396
00:56:04,695 --> 00:56:08,165
All right, but I don't like it.

397
00:56:17,708 --> 00:56:19,109
Hey, wait a minute.

398
00:56:19,209 --> 00:56:21,612
Where are you going?

399
00:56:21,712 --> 00:56:24,114
Wait.

400
00:56:24,214 --> 00:56:26,216
What's that thing you
carry around on your belt?

401
00:56:26,316 --> 00:56:27,452
A hand.

402
00:56:27,552 --> 00:56:29,253
I kind of figured that.

403
00:56:29,353 --> 00:56:30,588
Whose hand is it?

404
00:56:30,688 --> 00:56:35,025
Mandrak's, I've
come to find him.

405
00:56:35,125 --> 00:56:37,462
Why do you have his
hand, and what are

406
00:56:37,562 --> 00:56:39,163
You gonna do when you find him?

407
00:56:39,263 --> 00:56:40,565
Battle.

408
00:56:40,665 --> 00:56:42,467
Oh, don't tell me.

409
00:56:42,567 --> 00:56:44,034
You're from some Nordic
country, and you're

410
00:56:44,134 --> 00:56:46,036
Here to catch a criminal
and take him back with you.

411
00:56:50,074 --> 00:56:53,377
The Wizard has given
me an impossible task.

412
00:56:53,478 --> 00:56:55,546
Where do I find this
man in this land?

413
00:56:55,646 --> 00:56:56,714
Is this the underworld?

414
00:56:56,814 --> 00:57:00,918
Sometimes, it
sure seems like it.

415
00:57:01,018 --> 00:57:04,555
Hey, where are you from, anyway?

416
00:57:04,655 --> 00:57:05,623
Armana.

417
00:57:05,723 --> 00:57:07,592
Armana?

418
00:57:07,692 --> 00:57:09,359
I don't think I've
heard of that.

419
00:57:09,460 --> 00:57:11,261
I've come to find Mandrak.

420
00:57:11,361 --> 00:57:15,132
OK, well, welcome to LA.

421
00:57:15,232 --> 00:57:16,701
LA?

422
00:57:16,801 --> 00:57:19,870
What is LA?

423
00:57:19,970 --> 00:57:22,006
Los Angeles?

424
00:57:22,106 --> 00:57:23,474
I'm sure you've heard of it.

425
00:57:23,574 --> 00:57:24,274
No.

426
00:57:28,613 --> 00:57:30,648

What is this shit?

00:58:08,252 --> 00:58:09,887
Get him, Crank, find out.

434
00:58:17,461 --> 00:58:19,897
He's something, ain't he, Cogs?

435
00:58:19,997 --> 00:58:23,534
I mean, he's like
a friggin Conan.

436
00:58:23,634 --> 00:58:28,072
He saved Penny from
a real bad scene.

437
00:58:28,172 --> 00:58:31,742
This is some kind of stunt
she's pulling, isn't it?

438
00:58:31,842 --> 00:58:32,777
How can you say that?

439
00:58:35,713 --> 00:58:37,014
Look, Cogs, I was there, too.

440
00:58:37,114 --> 00:58:39,016
I'm telling ya.

441
00:58:39,116 --> 00:58:40,284
We don't know who this guy is.

442
00:58:40,384 --> 00:58:42,152
He came out of nowhere
and beat the shit

443
00:58:42,252 --> 00:58:44,421
Out of those gang bangers.

444
00:58:44,521 --> 00:58:46,857
He was incredible.

445
00:58:46,957 --> 00:58:48,693
I haven't seen anything
like that since Superman.

446
00:58:56,033 --> 00:58:57,101
Let me know when it's finished.

447
00:59:00,137 --> 00:59:05,943
Right, whatever you say, Cogs.

00:59:06,043 --> 00:59:06,744
Yes.

What is it, Brice?

452
00:59:21,058 --> 00:59:24,795
I just wanted to make sure
that gorilla was in his cage.

453
00:59:24,895 --> 00:59:27,531
He's not a gorilla,
and I'm fine.

454
00:59:27,632 --> 00:59:30,801
In fact, we just went
shopping for some new clothes.

455

Is that all, Brie?

00:59:32,603 --> 00:59:36,440
I just wanted to make
sure you were OK, OK?

01:00:22,286 --> 01:00:24,388
So... so why do you want
this Mandrak so badly?

463
01:00:27,925 --> 01:00:30,294
He murdered my wife.

Oh, I am sorry.

465
01:00:36,333 --> 01:00:40,504
He killed her and stole
the crystal amulet.

I must return it to
the Wizard or my tribe

and medications for that sort

Where do you think

You're gonna find this guy?

up some information for me

better not regret this.

a problem with that?

would make us rich.

crystal has lost its power.

ain't got the money,

Then there ain't
nothing for you, honey.

this is not the forest.

01:09:32,902 --> 01:09:36,240
Sorry, Penny, no luck.

546
01:10:09,273 --> 01:10:12,175
[Busy signal]

547
01:10:14,778 --> 01:10:16,680
Damn it, Penny,
get off the phone!

548
01:10:30,727 --> 01:10:35,765
What we need is a positive role
model, a hero you might say,

549
01:10:35,865 --> 01:10:37,367
Who could rally the
citizens to take

550
01:10:37,467 --> 01:10:38,802
Action and make a difference.

551
01:10:38,902 --> 01:10:40,537
I must be crazy.

552
01:10:40,637 --> 01:10:45,842
Nah, this is exactly what gives
KPTC the cutting edge, Cogs.

553
01:10:45,942 --> 01:10:48,345
It's about time
you got some balls.

554
01:10:48,445 --> 01:10:50,246
Watch it, mister,
or I'll have your ass

555
01:10:50,347 --> 01:10:53,383
On that sewer plant special
for the next four weeks.

556
01:10:53,483 --> 01:10:56,553
Easy, Cogs, I was just joking.

557
01:10:56,653 --> 01:10:58,522
PENNY (ON TV): He didn't
make this week's payment.

558
01:10:58,622 --> 01:11:02,258
This is just one gang-related
incident in over 239

559
01:11:02,359 --> 01:11:04,694
That have happened in
our city this year.

560
01:11:04,794 --> 01:11:07,030
It appears that
man does not change.

561
01:11:07,130 --> 01:11:09,032
PENNY (ON TV): Whatever
happened to morals,

562
01:11:09,132 --> 01:11:11,000
Ethics, and common decency?

563
01:11:11,100 --> 01:11:13,503
[Laughter]

564
01:11:15,572 --> 01:11:16,806
Here it comes.

565
01:11:16,906 --> 01:11:17,974
THUG (ON TV): What's
going on here?

566
01:11:25,715 --> 01:11:26,416
Doran.

567
01:11:26,516 --> 01:11:27,216
Doran.

568
01:11:30,487 --> 01:11:31,388
It can't be.

569
01:11:36,960 --> 01:11:40,630
Why does it seem
like I know you?

570
01:11:40,730 --> 01:11:42,031
It's almost frightening.

571
01:11:44,934 --> 01:11:49,773
There is no reason for
you to fear when with me.

572
01:11:49,873 --> 01:11:54,544
When you find him, what then?

573
01:11:54,644 --> 01:11:58,515
If I am triumphant in
battle, I must return home.

574
01:12:04,320 --> 01:12:06,790
Do not leave me, Doran.

575
01:12:06,890 --> 01:12:07,591
Stay.

576
01:12:15,131 --> 01:12:16,032
Please, stay.

577
01:12:36,453 --> 01:12:37,353
That was him.

578
01:12:41,425 --> 01:12:42,826
That was Doran.

579
01:12:47,864 --> 01:12:49,265
I know who it was, you idiot.

580
01:12:55,805 --> 01:12:57,206
How did he get here?

581
01:13:02,245 --> 01:13:03,146
He's come for revenge.

582
01:13:06,716 --> 01:13:09,586
By all the gods.

583
01:13:09,686 --> 01:13:12,088
What are we going
to do about him?

584
01:13:12,188 --> 01:13:14,057
Mandrak, what do we do?

585
01:13:14,157 --> 01:13:15,058
Don't be a fool.

586
01:13:15,158 --> 01:13:17,527
He does not know where we are.

587
01:13:17,627 --> 01:13:22,198
It's only a matter of
time before he finds us,

588
01:13:22,298 --> 01:13:24,634
And then he will
chop off my head.

589
01:13:42,218 --> 01:13:43,620
We must kill him first.

590
01:13:47,724 --> 01:13:49,626
Kill him before he finds us.

591
01:13:52,729 --> 01:13:57,867
Kill him before he finds us.

592
01:13:57,967 --> 01:14:00,336
We kill him first.

593
01:14:03,940 --> 01:14:05,308
Yes.

594
01:14:05,408 --> 01:14:07,811
Yes.

595
01:14:07,911 --> 01:14:13,282
This Penny Price, she
will lead us to Doran.

596
01:14:47,717 --> 01:14:49,953
You boys are in luck today.

597
01:14:50,053 --> 01:14:53,690
I just got in a new shipment.

598
01:14:53,790 --> 01:14:55,491
Yeah, anything you can
possibly want, I got.

599
01:14:55,592 --> 01:14:57,426
Let's take a look.

600
01:14:57,527 --> 01:15:04,701
Hmm, yeah, oh, M-16s,
AK-47s, Uzis, oh, look,

601
01:15:04,801 --> 01:15:06,703
Magazines up the ying yang.

602
01:15:06,803 --> 01:15:11,875
Hey, hey, special
grenades, boom, gentlemen,

603
01:15:11,975 --> 01:15:14,110
Pick your poison.

604
01:15:14,210 --> 01:15:17,513
Something simple,
but effective.

605
01:15:17,614 --> 01:15:20,950
Oh, hmm, aha, here's a beauty.

606
01:15:21,050 --> 01:15:25,555
Yeah, this'll take
on your barbarian.

607
01:15:25,655 --> 01:15:28,958
Here, try it out.

608
01:15:29,058 --> 01:15:31,761
I will take one of those.

609
01:15:31,861 --> 01:15:35,531
Yes, watch.

610
01:15:35,632 --> 01:15:36,332
Here.

611
01:15:36,432 --> 01:15:37,601
You like 'em small, huh?

612
01:15:37,701 --> 01:15:40,436
Well, you know what
they say, a guy's gun

613
01:15:40,536 --> 01:15:41,404
Is as big as his prick.

614
01:15:45,408 --> 01:15:48,211
Hey, just joking, you guys.

615
01:15:48,311 --> 01:15:50,614
OK, we're gonna get
back down to business.

616
01:15:50,714 --> 01:15:52,882
Uh, that'll be, uh,
four bills all together.

617
01:15:52,982 --> 01:15:54,383
And I'm gonna tell
you right now,

618
01:15:54,483 --> 01:15:57,854
You're not gonna get a better
deal anywhere on the streets.

619
01:15:57,954 --> 01:16:00,323
Hey, watch where you guys
are pointing those things.

620
01:16:00,423 --> 01:16:01,324
Have a nice day.

621
01:16:42,098 --> 01:16:43,967
Who the hell are you?

622
01:16:44,067 --> 01:16:46,502
Where is the
woman, Penny Price?

623
01:16:46,602 --> 01:16:47,937
What do you want with her?

624
01:16:51,340 --> 01:16:52,742
I ask the questions.

625
01:16:52,842 --> 01:16:54,310
You answer.

626
01:16:54,410 --> 01:16:56,379
Just tell us where she is.

627
01:16:59,582 --> 01:17:02,118
Damn you, get out of
here, or I'll... I'll have

628
01:17:02,218 --> 01:17:03,319
Every cop I know
up your ass pulling

629
01:17:03,419 --> 01:17:04,453
Out your fucking [inaudible].

630
01:17:09,258 --> 01:17:12,628
You will answer
now, or I will cut

631
01:17:12,729 --> 01:17:14,197
Off your fingers one by one.

632
01:17:14,297 --> 01:17:16,365
You go to hell.

633
01:17:16,465 --> 01:17:17,166
No!

634
01:17:22,706 --> 01:17:23,606
Very well.

635
01:17:37,086 --> 01:17:43,392
Your daughter, it would be
a pity if she were to die.

636
01:17:43,492 --> 01:17:46,863
Now, tell me where the woman is.

637
01:18:04,513 --> 01:18:06,916
Cogs would kill me
if he knew I had this.

638
01:18:16,993 --> 01:18:19,896
Cogs?

639
01:18:19,996 --> 01:18:23,099
Is you OK?

640
01:18:23,199 --> 01:18:25,769
They want Penny.

641
01:18:25,869 --> 01:18:27,270
Who wants Penny?

642
01:18:37,546 --> 01:18:38,247
Penny.

643
01:19:32,735 --> 01:19:34,637
Don't worry, Penny, I'm coming.

644
01:19:51,720 --> 01:19:54,023
This is yours.

645
01:19:54,123 --> 01:19:54,824
My hand.

646
01:19:54,924 --> 01:19:56,492
The amulet, where is it?

647
01:19:56,592 --> 01:19:57,293
I don't have it.

648
01:20:01,664 --> 01:20:04,033
You're a liar and a murderer.

649
01:20:04,133 --> 01:20:05,034
It's hidden.

650
01:20:05,134 --> 01:20:06,035
Where?

651
01:20:06,135 --> 01:20:08,037
Somewhere close.

652
01:20:08,137 --> 01:20:09,538
Hey, I'll take you there.

653
01:20:09,638 --> 01:20:10,539
[Gunshot]

654
01:20:13,142 --> 01:20:16,012
Give me the weapon.

655
01:20:16,112 --> 01:20:19,515
Come on.

656
01:20:19,615 --> 01:20:22,518
Now you die, barbarian.

657
01:20:22,618 --> 01:20:24,020
PENNY: Doran?

658
01:20:24,120 --> 01:20:25,488
Who are these men?

659
01:20:31,227 --> 01:20:32,962
Stop.

660
01:20:33,062 --> 01:20:34,463
Move away, barbarian,
or I'll kill

661
01:20:34,563 --> 01:20:35,431
Her right before your eyes.

662
01:20:35,531 --> 01:20:36,232
No.

663
01:20:36,332 --> 01:20:37,500
Do as I say.

664
01:20:37,600 --> 01:20:40,769
Your sword is no match
for these weapons.

665
01:20:40,870 --> 01:20:43,272
I bid you farewell.

666
01:20:43,372 --> 01:20:44,440
No.

667
01:20:44,540 --> 01:20:45,241
Doran.

668
01:20:45,341 --> 01:20:46,242
Kill him.

669
01:20:46,342 --> 01:20:49,745
He has left you here to die.

670
01:20:49,845 --> 01:20:51,247
Die?

671
01:20:51,347 --> 01:20:52,248
I have this.

672
01:21:09,298 --> 01:21:11,200
Doctor, come on!

673
01:21:11,300 --> 01:21:13,202
Move it!

674
01:21:13,302 --> 01:21:14,203
Come on.

675
01:22:47,130 --> 01:22:47,997
Where is Mandrak?

676
01:22:54,103 --> 01:22:56,639
Where is Mandrak?

677
01:22:56,739 --> 01:22:57,440
Speak!

678
01:24:17,920 --> 01:24:18,721
Where's Penny?

679
01:24:18,821 --> 01:24:20,556
Mandrak has captured her.

680
01:24:20,656 --> 01:24:21,790
He will lead me to him.

681
01:24:28,597 --> 01:24:30,099
He looks dead to me.

682
01:24:30,199 --> 01:24:34,069
He dies when I want him to die.

683
01:24:34,170 --> 01:24:35,338
OK, OK.

684
01:24:38,341 --> 01:24:39,442
I'll go with you.

685
01:24:39,542 --> 01:24:41,277
You?

686
01:24:41,377 --> 01:24:43,346
Yeah, me.

687
01:24:43,446 --> 01:24:44,147
What?

688
01:24:44,247 --> 01:24:46,449
You got a problem with that?

689
01:24:46,549 --> 01:24:49,685
You do not look like a warrior.

690
01:24:49,785 --> 01:24:51,086
Oh, yeah?

691
01:24:51,187 --> 01:24:53,956
Let me tell you something, pal.

692
01:24:54,056 --> 01:24:55,424
I can handle myself.

693
01:24:55,524 --> 01:24:57,960
Then together we
shall do battle.

694
01:24:58,060 --> 01:24:59,695
Battle?

695
01:24:59,795 --> 01:25:01,230
Well, yeah, battle.

696
01:25:06,169 --> 01:25:07,870
I think I know where
we can find this slime.

697
01:25:35,864 --> 01:25:38,267
It's a little, nice
place you got here, huh?

698
01:25:38,367 --> 01:25:39,268
What do you want?

699
01:25:42,838 --> 01:25:46,209
I'm looking for a man,
a man with one hand.

700
01:25:46,309 --> 01:25:47,743
Have you seen him here?

701
01:25:47,843 --> 01:25:50,879
Yeah, I've seen him,
damn trouble maker.

702
01:25:50,979 --> 01:25:52,848
Who the fuck are you?

703
01:25:52,948 --> 01:25:54,883
Hey, look, don't
matter who I am.

704
01:25:54,983 --> 01:25:57,853
Where can I find this guy?

705
01:25:57,953 --> 01:25:59,355
How the hell would I know?

706
01:25:59,455 --> 01:26:01,557
Look what he did to my TV.

707
01:26:01,657 --> 01:26:04,059
Next time he comes in
here, I'm gonna kill him.

708
01:26:04,159 --> 01:26:07,463
So beat it, before I do
the same thing to you.

709
01:26:07,563 --> 01:26:10,433
All right, relax.

710
01:26:10,533 --> 01:26:11,667
What?

711
01:26:11,767 --> 01:26:14,870
For a minute there, I almost
thought you were a cop.

712
01:26:14,970 --> 01:26:17,340
Look, I'm not
interested, all right?

713
01:26:17,440 --> 01:26:19,475
You're looking for Mandrak.

714
01:26:19,575 --> 01:26:20,276
You're interested.

715
01:26:32,221 --> 01:26:34,089
All right, talk to me.

716
01:26:37,626 --> 01:26:39,462
I'm gonna cost you, sugar.

717
01:26:39,562 --> 01:26:43,832
You're beginning to
look familiar to me,

718
01:26:43,932 --> 01:26:48,471
Someone I knew a long time ago.

719
01:26:48,571 --> 01:26:50,005
You pig.

720
01:26:50,105 --> 01:26:50,806
Let me down.

721
01:26:54,176 --> 01:26:57,980
Perhaps you can put me on the
television, make me famous,

722
01:26:58,080 --> 01:27:01,584
Like the movie stars.

723
01:27:01,684 --> 01:27:04,353
If that's what you
want, I can rearrange it.

724
01:27:04,453 --> 01:27:06,021
Just let me down.

725
01:27:06,121 --> 01:27:07,222
That's not all that I want.

726
01:27:10,225 --> 01:27:15,097
Allow me to introduce myself,
Mandrak the Magnificent,

727
01:27:15,197 --> 01:27:17,600
At your service.

728
01:27:17,700 --> 01:27:19,101
Mandrak?

729
01:27:19,201 --> 01:27:26,074
You're the one he's...
The man with one hand.

730
01:27:26,174 --> 01:27:32,581
It is indeed I.

731
01:27:32,681 --> 01:27:33,582
Oh, God.

732
01:27:55,638 --> 01:27:57,039
This place gives me the creeps.

733
01:28:22,565 --> 01:28:24,967
It's a trap!

734
01:28:25,067 --> 01:28:26,469
Mandrak.

735
01:28:26,569 --> 01:28:27,970
There she is, barbarian.

736
01:28:28,070 --> 01:28:29,472
Free her.

737
01:28:29,572 --> 01:28:32,441
I give you this chance,
for I am a fair man.

738
01:28:32,541 --> 01:28:36,945
No, Doran, don't
come any closer.

739
01:28:37,045 --> 01:28:38,447
Let me nail him.

740
01:28:38,547 --> 01:28:41,450
[Gun clicking]

741
01:28:42,551 --> 01:28:44,453
Damn, I knew I forgot something.

742
01:29:03,906 --> 01:29:04,807
By the gods.

743
01:29:14,316 --> 01:29:16,685
Doran.

744
01:29:16,785 --> 01:29:18,687
Wait.

745
01:29:18,787 --> 01:29:20,155
Wait.

746
01:29:20,255 --> 01:29:21,323
Hey, are you all right?

747
01:29:21,424 --> 01:29:22,224
Yes, I'm fine.

748
01:29:22,324 --> 01:29:23,358
Its out of control, Brice.

749
01:29:23,459 --> 01:29:24,660
Maybe you should go.

750
01:29:24,760 --> 01:29:26,161
Are you kidding me?

751
01:29:31,233 --> 01:29:32,601
Show yourself, coward.

752
01:30:01,464 --> 01:30:03,365
Stay here.

753
01:30:03,466 --> 01:30:04,867
Run.

754
01:30:04,967 --> 01:30:08,336
You took my hand, barbarian,
but gave me a weapon.

755
01:30:08,437 --> 01:30:09,805
I'm gonna get you, creep.

756
01:30:20,816 --> 01:30:23,218
She was delectable, barbarian.

757
01:30:23,318 --> 01:30:27,155
Her body was all mine to
do with whatever I please.

758
01:30:27,255 --> 01:30:30,092
That's really why you
came back, isn't it?

759
01:30:30,192 --> 01:30:33,996
Well, the amulet is useless,
dead and lifeless, just

760
01:30:34,096 --> 01:30:36,231
Like she was when I left her.

761
01:30:36,331 --> 01:30:39,067
Your evil shall
end by my sword!

762
01:31:15,470 --> 01:31:19,341
There is no way back
for you, barbarian.

763
01:31:19,441 --> 01:31:20,342
Welcome to hell.

764
01:31:50,873 --> 01:31:52,608
I wonder if hope is
lost for all mankind.

765
01:31:55,343 --> 01:31:59,381
No, it's not.

766
01:31:59,481 --> 01:32:01,884
You and I are no different.

767
01:32:01,984 --> 01:32:06,555
It doesn't matter when
it is or where we are,

768
01:32:06,655 --> 01:32:09,224
We'll both make damn sure
that hope stays where it

769
01:32:09,324 --> 01:32:16,464
Belongs, in our hearts forever.

770
01:32:16,565 --> 01:32:19,467
[Penny crying]

771
01:32:29,011 --> 01:32:30,879
Our love shall be
for an eternity.

772
01:32:58,340 --> 01:33:01,209
You OK, Penny?

773
01:33:01,309 --> 01:33:03,211
He wasn't such a
bad guy after all.

774
01:33:07,315 --> 01:33:10,085
OK, look, turn the camera
on, and no matter what...

775
01:33:10,185 --> 01:33:13,055
No matter what,
keep it rolling.

776
01:33:13,155 --> 01:33:13,989
Got it.

777
01:33:20,228 --> 01:33:21,864
Rolling.

778
01:33:21,964 --> 01:33:25,267
The end to a story of
gallantry and heroism, not

779
01:33:25,367 --> 01:33:27,836
To mention sacrifice...
The streets

780
01:33:27,936 --> 01:33:31,106
Are rid of one more malignancy.

781
01:33:31,206 --> 01:33:35,377
And the world has only
the memory of a great man

782
01:33:35,477 --> 01:33:39,715
Who some would consider a king.

783
01:33:39,815 --> 01:33:42,751
This is Penny Price,
Channel 5 Action News.

784
01:33:45,854 --> 01:33:48,791
