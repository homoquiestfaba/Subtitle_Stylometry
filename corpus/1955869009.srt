1
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,894
- So what, maybe you
piss out of the window?

2
00:05:37,918 --> 00:05:40,768
- I don't think I have
the right equipment

3
00:05:40,792 --> 00:05:42,310
for that Uncle Gus.

4
00:05:42,334 --> 00:05:43,894
- Eh, nobody's perfect kiddo.

5
00:05:43,918 --> 00:05:46,125
- Look, I called the Super,

6
00:05:46,667 --> 00:05:48,185
and left a message, so,

7
00:05:48,209 --> 00:05:50,185
we'll see what happens.

8
00:05:50,209 --> 00:05:51,751
- I gotta get a look
at this dump, hah.

9
00:05:52,083 --> 00:05:53,894
- It's not a dump, it just
needs some sprucing up.

10
00:05:53,918 --> 00:05:57,059
- Yeah well you
wanna spruce it up,

11
00:05:57,083 --> 00:05:58,268
you gotta come by
here and pick up

12
00:05:58,292 --> 00:05:59,226
some of that lady shit you left.

13
00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:00,602
Yeah you could move a
million times over

14
00:06:00,626 --> 00:06:02,101
and I'd still gotta be
tripping over boxes

15
00:06:02,125 --> 00:06:03,685
of tampons and nail polish.

16
00:06:03,709 --> 00:06:06,226
- Glad you're
keeping busy, look,

17
00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:07,518
I got a lot more
moving in to do here,

18
00:06:07,542 --> 00:06:09,250
okay, so I'll see
you on Tuesday.

19
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,643
Excuse me, sir, can
you spare a moment

20
00:06:20,667 --> 00:06:22,643
to talk about the whales?

21
00:06:22,667 --> 00:06:24,334
Hello miss, can you
spare a moment to talk

22
00:06:24,792 --> 00:06:26,435
about the whales?

23
00:06:26,459 --> 00:06:27,979
You see, we here at
Whale Savers are...

24
00:06:31,292 --> 00:06:34,852
Hello sir, can you
spare a moment

25
00:06:34,876 --> 00:06:36,643
to talk about the whales?

26
00:06:36,667 --> 00:06:37,935
- What?

27
00:06:37,959 --> 00:06:39,185
- Well we here at Whale
Savers are committed

28
00:06:39,209 --> 00:06:41,059
to the conservation and
protection of all whale life.

29
00:06:41,083 --> 00:06:43,435
- Huh?

30
00:06:43,459 --> 00:06:44,685
- Particularly in
the Antarctic and

31
00:06:44,709 --> 00:06:45,643
the Northwestern Pacific Oceans.

32
00:06:45,667 --> 00:06:47,143
- What?

33
00:06:47,167 --> 00:06:48,477
- Are you aware of what's
going on in these waters?

34
00:06:48,501 --> 00:06:49,542
- No, no...

35
00:06:59,876 --> 00:07:03,268
- Hey is that your lady?

36
00:07:03,292 --> 00:07:04,584
She's pretty hot, for a drawing.

37
00:07:06,959 --> 00:07:08,709
- You know what's not hot?

38
00:07:10,334 --> 00:07:12,000
CO2 powered grenade
tipped harpoons,

39
00:07:12,292 --> 00:07:14,268
penetrating your ribs
at 370 feet a second,

40
00:07:14,292 --> 00:07:17,268
detonating inside you,
bursting your organs,

41
00:07:17,292 --> 00:07:19,268
shattering your spine,
blades retracting

42
00:07:19,292 --> 00:07:20,976
on your insides as
you're winched aboard

43
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,268
a ship filled with butchers
who hack and slice

44
00:07:22,292 --> 00:07:24,268
your body into tiny
little pieces,

45
00:07:24,292 --> 00:07:26,059
all while you're
still breathing.

46
00:07:29,292 --> 00:07:30,542
These were taken on the deck of

47
00:07:31,083 --> 00:07:32,518
the Obagi Maru, one
of the most notorious

48
00:07:32,542 --> 00:07:35,226
and brutal whaling ships
in the Antarctic.

49
00:07:35,250 --> 00:07:37,351
You see, we here
at Whale Savers...

50
00:07:37,375 --> 00:07:38,918
- Hey dude, I'm trying
to eat here man.

51
00:07:47,792 --> 00:07:51,602
- Excuse me sir, could
you spare just a moment

52
00:07:51,626 --> 00:07:53,393
to talk about...

53
00:07:53,417 --> 00:07:54,709
- You're being too polite.

54
00:07:56,417 --> 00:07:57,268
- Huh?

55
00:07:57,292 --> 00:07:58,435
- These people are
sheep, all they wanna do

56
00:07:58,459 --> 00:07:59,727
is follow the herd, you
have to shock them

57
00:07:59,751 --> 00:08:01,268
out of their habit.

58
00:08:01,292 --> 00:08:02,477
- At orientation they
told me to stick

59
00:08:02,501 --> 00:08:03,768
to the script.

60
00:08:03,792 --> 00:08:05,268
- No one ever became great
by sticking to the script.

61
00:08:05,292 --> 00:08:07,268
Here, let me show you.

62
00:08:07,292 --> 00:08:08,268
Excuse me sir!

63
00:08:08,292 --> 00:08:09,351
Take a look at the
atrocities that occur

64
00:08:09,375 --> 00:08:10,268
on the Obagi Maru!

65
00:08:10,292 --> 00:08:11,459
- What the fuck dude?

66
00:08:12,292 --> 00:08:13,459
- That's all right, I got it.

67
00:08:15,792 --> 00:08:17,209
- Does that happen a lot?

68
00:08:17,667 --> 00:08:18,852
- It comes with the territory.

69
00:08:18,876 --> 00:08:20,268
Look, Danni, this is
important work we're doing.

70
00:08:20,292 --> 00:08:23,268
I don't know what you did
before you came here,

71
00:08:23,292 --> 00:08:24,751
but this is life and death.

72
00:10:36,167 --> 00:10:38,685
- It's after news hour.

73
00:10:38,709 --> 00:10:39,894
A string of bizarre
animal attacks

74
00:10:39,918 --> 00:10:41,477
stirred up northern New
Jersey last night.

75
00:10:41,501 --> 00:10:43,477
Peekskill resident Ginny
Hernandez was mauled

76
00:10:43,501 --> 00:10:45,685
to death as she opened up
her deli in the early hours

77
00:10:45,709 --> 00:10:48,101
this morning.

78
00:10:48,125 --> 00:10:49,268
Sheriff Douglas remains
baffled as to the cause,

79
00:10:49,292 --> 00:10:51,292
stating: "I've never..."

80
00:11:02,792 --> 00:11:06,768
- I don't know maybe it got
sucked down the drain.

81
00:11:06,792 --> 00:11:09,459
Hah, maybe a fucking ninja
came through the window.

82
00:11:09,918 --> 00:11:13,101
- All the windows were locked,

83
00:11:13,125 --> 00:11:14,602
and the chain was
still on the door.

84
00:11:14,626 --> 00:11:16,602
When the Super is
done I'm gonna see

85
00:11:16,626 --> 00:11:17,852
if there's another way
into the apartment

86
00:11:17,876 --> 00:11:19,268
I don't know about.

87
00:11:19,292 --> 00:11:20,560
- You sure you didn't dream
about putting it up?

88
00:11:20,584 --> 00:11:22,477
I mean, I dream about
boring shit all the time.

89
00:11:22,501 --> 00:11:25,018
- No, I put it up.

90
00:11:25,042 --> 00:11:26,501
- Yeah, after how many beers?

91
00:11:27,042 --> 00:11:29,167
All right, all right,
all right, okay.

92
00:11:29,667 --> 00:11:31,268
So what are you
gonna do about it?

93
00:11:31,292 --> 00:11:32,560
- I'm gonna call the
management company

94
00:11:32,584 --> 00:11:34,101
and have the locks changed.

95
00:11:34,125 --> 00:11:35,477
- But you said the
chain was on the door.

96
00:11:35,501 --> 00:11:37,542
- Hey what are you
doing in there anyway?

97
00:11:38,709 --> 00:11:40,768
- I got a potluck for the VA.

98
00:11:40,792 --> 00:11:42,584
- I thought you hated the VA?

99
00:11:43,292 --> 00:11:44,810
You always said it smells
of piss and death.

100
00:11:44,834 --> 00:11:47,143
- It does smell,
but I got a deal

101
00:11:47,167 --> 00:11:48,375
on some cheap shrimp.

102
00:11:56,125 --> 00:11:59,768
- This is all garbage,
you can toss it.

103
00:11:59,792 --> 00:12:01,709
- You sure?

104
00:12:02,501 --> 00:12:03,501
- Positive.

105
00:12:03,959 --> 00:12:05,125
Enjoy the fiesta.

106
00:12:19,292 --> 00:12:22,518
- Danni?

107
00:12:22,542 --> 00:12:23,584
I thought that was you!

108
00:12:25,292 --> 00:12:26,685
- Oh hiya Beth.

109
00:12:26,709 --> 00:12:27,768
- How have you been?

110
00:12:27,792 --> 00:12:29,101
- Good and you?

111
00:12:29,125 --> 00:12:30,268
- Oh, exhausted.

112
00:12:30,292 --> 00:12:32,768
I just got off a double.

113
00:12:32,792 --> 00:12:34,268
- Oh right.

114
00:12:34,292 --> 00:12:35,477
- The girls and I were
just talking about

115
00:12:35,501 --> 00:12:36,643
you the other day.

116
00:12:36,667 --> 00:12:38,268
Are you still living
with your uncle?

117
00:12:38,292 --> 00:12:40,560
- Uh no, actually I
moved into a new place.

118
00:12:40,584 --> 00:12:43,768
- Good, oh good, we were hoping

119
00:12:43,792 --> 00:12:46,185
that would be the case.

120
00:12:46,209 --> 00:12:47,351
I'm so glad you're getting
back on your feet.

121
00:12:47,375 --> 00:12:49,768
Oh my gosh, my
bachelorette party,

122
00:12:49,792 --> 00:12:51,518
this Saturday!

123
00:12:51,542 --> 00:12:52,810
Tom and I finally set a date.

124
00:12:52,834 --> 00:12:54,435
Did you know that he's
teaching at Columbia now?

125
00:12:54,459 --> 00:12:57,643
It's kind of a big deal.

126
00:12:57,667 --> 00:12:59,268
But you should totally
come, have a cocktail,

127
00:12:59,292 --> 00:13:01,852
maybe three.

128
00:13:01,876 --> 00:13:03,143
- I don't know I'm
still kinda moving in.

129
00:13:03,167 --> 00:13:05,226
- You know I gotta go
because this is my stop,

130
00:13:05,250 --> 00:13:06,852
but, oh, it was so good
catching up with you,

131
00:13:06,876 --> 00:13:08,435
I'll tell the girls that
you said hi, all right?

132
00:13:08,459 --> 00:13:10,602
Hey, call me!

133
00:13:10,626 --> 00:13:11,834
- Hmm-mm.

134
00:13:30,292 --> 00:13:33,685
- Hey I'm Preston the Super.

135
00:13:33,709 --> 00:13:35,375
- Oh I thought you were
fixing the toilet.

136
00:13:36,709 --> 00:13:38,894
- Oh yeah yeah, I'm
almost done with that.

137
00:13:38,918 --> 00:13:41,018
There's still a little
architectural work.

138
00:13:41,042 --> 00:13:43,501
I'm real good with my hands.

139
00:13:44,250 --> 00:13:45,626
- Hey did you come
in here earlier

140
00:13:47,501 --> 00:13:49,059
while I was sleeping?

141
00:13:49,083 --> 00:13:50,501
- You that chick in 7A?

142
00:13:50,959 --> 00:13:53,101
'Cause she got it all wrong,

143
00:13:53,125 --> 00:13:54,268
I went in there to
fix the radiator,

144
00:13:54,292 --> 00:13:55,393
how was I to know she
sleeps to the noon?

145
00:13:55,417 --> 00:13:56,918
- My shower curtain, it's gone.

146
00:13:57,876 --> 00:13:59,292
- Oh...

147
00:14:01,125 --> 00:14:02,125
Well it wasn't me.

148
00:14:02,542 --> 00:14:03,959
Meaning you got a ghost.

149
00:14:05,125 --> 00:14:07,292
Ohohoho...

150
00:14:09,501 --> 00:14:13,268
Look, stick to
taking baths lady.

151
00:14:13,292 --> 00:14:16,101
Everybody loves bubbles.

152
00:14:34,876 --> 00:14:38,292
- Blue is better.

153
00:15:42,709 --> 00:15:45,768
- These were taken
on the deck of

154
00:15:45,792 --> 00:15:47,268
the Obagi Maru, now they're
just an artist rendition,

155
00:15:47,292 --> 00:15:49,268
I haven't really had the
chance to color in all

156
00:15:49,292 --> 00:15:50,768
of the blood yet, but
I can assure you

157
00:15:50,792 --> 00:15:52,268
they're an exact replica
of the pictures taken.

158
00:15:52,292 --> 00:15:54,268
- Uhuh, yep, I know all
about those photos.

159
00:15:54,292 --> 00:15:57,292
- Oh, well so then you
know how much a donation

160
00:15:57,667 --> 00:15:59,685
would make a difference.

161
00:15:59,709 --> 00:16:01,268
- What I don't get
is why you're here.

162
00:16:01,292 --> 00:16:03,492
- Well I represent Whale Savers,
and we are trying to...

163
00:16:03,626 --> 00:16:06,268
- No what I mean is, how
come you're wasting

164
00:16:06,292 --> 00:16:08,935
your time on nickel and
dime street donations,

165
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:10,602
I mean shouldn't you be out
there with those guys,

166
00:16:10,626 --> 00:16:12,477
uh, what's their name again?

167
00:16:12,501 --> 00:16:14,393
- Sea Saviors?

168
00:16:14,417 --> 00:16:15,393
- Yeah, that's it.

169
00:16:15,417 --> 00:16:16,810
You should join them, I mean,

170
00:16:16,834 --> 00:16:18,292
if you really care.

171
00:16:28,292 --> 00:16:32,185
- Well I've had my fill
of assholes today,

172
00:16:32,209 --> 00:16:34,059
you wanna grab a bite?

173
00:16:35,292 --> 00:16:36,310
Hey!

174
00:16:36,334 --> 00:16:37,226
- Huh?

175
00:16:37,250 --> 00:16:38,584
- Nothing, I just
wanted to see if

176
00:16:38,834 --> 00:16:40,268
you wanna grab some
lunch, but if you're busy

177
00:16:40,292 --> 00:16:41,477
that's cool.

178
00:16:41,501 --> 00:16:42,876
- Uh no, yeah, I
guess I could eat.

179
00:16:43,292 --> 00:16:45,417
- What'cha looking at?

180
00:16:48,292 --> 00:16:49,268
Holy shit that's incredible!

181
00:16:49,292 --> 00:16:50,852
- I know, keep it down.

182
00:16:50,876 --> 00:16:52,059
- This is huge, what
are you gonna do?

183
00:16:52,083 --> 00:16:53,810
- I'm gonna move out.

184
00:16:53,834 --> 00:16:55,059
- Move out, are you
crazy, think of the good

185
00:16:55,083 --> 00:16:56,310
you could with this, think
of the possibilities.

186
00:16:56,334 --> 00:16:58,226
- No it's fine, I'm just,
I'm gonna move back in

187
00:16:58,250 --> 00:16:59,810
with my Uncle Gus,
back on that couch,

188
00:16:59,834 --> 00:17:01,435
but I'll be far away
from whatever this is.

189
00:17:01,459 --> 00:17:04,018
- I have an idea.

190
00:17:04,042 --> 00:17:05,310
- Well, I don't need any
ideas, I only showed you this

191
00:17:05,334 --> 00:17:07,018
to check I'm not losing my mind,

192
00:17:07,042 --> 00:17:08,477
I'm not, job done,
thanks for your help.

193
00:17:08,501 --> 00:17:10,310
- These curtains must go
somewhere, all right.

194
00:17:10,334 --> 00:17:12,268
So, all we do is,
write down our number

195
00:17:12,292 --> 00:17:15,268
and wherever it goes,
someone's bound to call.

196
00:17:15,292 --> 00:17:17,393
- How's that gonna get
rid of this thing?

197
00:17:17,417 --> 00:17:19,477
- Because if we know where
the curtains are going,

198
00:17:19,501 --> 00:17:21,185
maybe we can do
something to stop them,

199
00:17:21,209 --> 00:17:22,667
you know, plug the
hole or something.

200
00:17:23,125 --> 00:17:24,792
- No, I don't have
to plug anything

201
00:17:26,709 --> 00:17:28,226
if I just walk away.

202
00:17:28,250 --> 00:17:29,792
- All right, suit yourself.

203
00:17:30,626 --> 00:17:32,292
Enjoy that couch.

204
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:42,435
Hey, what's your phone number?

205
00:17:42,459 --> 00:17:44,209
- Why, this is your idea,

206
00:17:44,709 --> 00:17:46,268
use your own number.

207
00:17:46,292 --> 00:17:47,584
- My phone is still in the shop.

208
00:17:47,792 --> 00:17:49,292
- Okay fine, but you
have to deal with

209
00:17:51,459 --> 00:17:53,542
whoever calls, okay?

210
00:18:02,584 --> 00:18:06,268
- Okay, I'm all
set, are you ready?

211
00:18:06,292 --> 00:18:08,143
- I guess.

212
00:18:08,167 --> 00:18:09,292
- Okay, here we go.

213
00:18:12,792 --> 00:18:16,268
How long do we have to wait?

214
00:18:16,292 --> 00:18:17,685
- Ugh, I think we have
to leave for it to work.

215
00:18:17,709 --> 00:18:20,167
- Oh.

216
00:18:22,417 --> 00:18:25,709
Take two.

217
00:18:34,292 --> 00:18:36,132
So how long before someone
calls, do you think?

218
00:18:38,167 --> 00:18:40,292
- I don't know, hopefully never.

219
00:18:40,667 --> 00:18:42,268
Hand me some soy sauce.

220
00:18:42,292 --> 00:18:43,876
- How do you think
they get it in there?

221
00:18:44,709 --> 00:18:46,334
- Machines?

222
00:18:46,918 --> 00:18:48,268
- Yeah but how, like they
must use some kind of

223
00:18:48,292 --> 00:18:50,292
adhesive to put the two
pieces of plastic together.

224
00:18:52,667 --> 00:18:55,976
Who's that?

225
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,292
- Oh, that's me
and my Uncle Gus.

226
00:18:59,417 --> 00:19:02,250
He raised after my mom died.

227
00:19:03,834 --> 00:19:04,834
- So you're a nurse?

228
00:19:07,292 --> 00:19:08,417
- I was a nurse.

229
00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:10,185
- What kind?

230
00:19:10,209 --> 00:19:11,268
- Hospice mostly, last
few years anyway.

231
00:19:11,292 --> 00:19:14,393
- That's for when the
people are dying, right?

232
00:19:14,417 --> 00:19:17,143
- Yup.

233
00:19:17,167 --> 00:19:18,167
- I wonder where they go.

234
00:19:20,209 --> 00:19:21,584
- What?

235
00:19:22,876 --> 00:19:23,876
- The curtains?

236
00:19:24,292 --> 00:19:26,012
- Oh, I don't care, I
just want 'em to stop.

237
00:19:26,125 --> 00:19:29,268
- They must be going
somewhere right,

238
00:19:29,292 --> 00:19:30,602
like an alternate
dimension maybe?

239
00:19:30,626 --> 00:19:32,375
- Or they're just vaporized.

240
00:19:32,751 --> 00:19:34,751
- I like to think it's
nice, wherever it is.

241
00:19:35,292 --> 00:19:37,292
And nothing bad could
ever happen there,

242
00:19:37,959 --> 00:19:40,125
like everything is safe,
even the shower curtains.

243
00:19:40,292 --> 00:19:43,292
And the whales.

244
00:19:43,667 --> 00:19:45,167
All right can't you
just picture them?

245
00:19:45,584 --> 00:19:47,268
Swimming through the
galactic ocean,

246
00:19:47,292 --> 00:19:49,185
eating space krill?

247
00:19:49,209 --> 00:19:50,518
Singing their beautiful songs.

248
00:19:50,542 --> 00:19:52,751
- Not really.

249
00:20:17,584 --> 00:20:21,059
Maybe you're right.

250
00:20:21,083 --> 00:20:22,417
Any place would be
an improvement.

251
00:20:22,834 --> 00:20:24,667
- To the galactic ocean.

252
00:21:17,125 --> 00:21:20,268
Did anyone call?

253
00:21:20,292 --> 00:21:21,268
- Uh no.

254
00:21:21,292 --> 00:21:22,584
- Are you making breakfast?

255
00:21:23,584 --> 00:21:24,435
- No.

256
00:21:24,459 --> 00:21:25,459
- Oh okay.

257
00:21:26,751 --> 00:21:28,059
I gotta go anyway.

258
00:21:28,083 --> 00:21:29,643
I got a second job
at Sandwich City.

259
00:21:29,667 --> 00:21:31,393
- Sure.

260
00:21:31,417 --> 00:21:32,602
- Well, keep an eye
on that phone, okay?

261
00:21:32,626 --> 00:21:34,792
Someone's bound to call, I
can feel it in my bones.

262
00:21:52,876 --> 00:21:55,542
- Hello?

263
00:21:56,083 --> 00:21:57,292
Hey Uncle Gus.

264
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:27,685
- You're wasting your time.

265
00:22:27,709 --> 00:22:29,292
- I'm sorry?

266
00:22:31,167 --> 00:22:32,477
- Half of New York is gonna
be under water in 10 years.

267
00:22:32,501 --> 00:22:34,727
Whales are gonna be
swimming down Park Avenue.

268
00:22:34,751 --> 00:22:38,435
And I'm gonna have to
fit this into a bikini.

269
00:22:38,459 --> 00:22:41,351
- Uh well the threat
to whales right now

270
00:22:41,375 --> 00:22:44,602
is still very real, and
any donation would help,

271
00:22:44,626 --> 00:22:47,976
you see, we here...

272
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,268
- Save me the guff sweetheart,
will you take a check?

273
00:22:49,292 --> 00:22:51,334
- Sure.

274
00:22:52,167 --> 00:22:53,292
Oh wow, thank you.

275
00:22:54,292 --> 00:22:56,143
Thank you so much.

276
00:22:56,167 --> 00:22:58,375
- Why do I have so
much junk in here?

277
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,852
- Excuse me.

278
00:23:00,876 --> 00:23:02,292
Hello?

279
00:23:02,918 --> 00:23:04,268
- Yeah, I'm calling
for Danni and Jim.

280
00:23:04,292 --> 00:23:06,334
- Uh this is Danni and Tim.

281
00:23:07,292 --> 00:23:09,268
- Miss?

282
00:23:09,292 --> 00:23:10,268
- Tim, all right, hold on.

283
00:23:10,292 --> 00:23:12,268
- Hello?

284
00:23:12,292 --> 00:23:13,351
- Who do I make
this check out to?

285
00:23:13,375 --> 00:23:14,518
- Hello?

286
00:23:14,542 --> 00:23:15,768
- We're actually a
little busy right now.

287
00:23:15,792 --> 00:23:17,268
- Hey I gotta open up,
there's something

288
00:23:17,292 --> 00:23:18,059
jamming, hang on.

289
00:23:18,083 --> 00:23:19,268
- You're busy, I got a
million things to do,

290
00:23:19,292 --> 00:23:20,393
I'm trying to give you
money and you say

291
00:23:20,417 --> 00:23:21,310
you're too busy, you're faking!

292
00:23:21,334 --> 00:23:22,268
- All right, jeez.

293
00:23:22,292 --> 00:23:23,268
- Fuck you.

294
00:23:23,292 --> 00:23:24,268
- Oh it does say Tim.

295
00:23:24,292 --> 00:23:25,268
- What says Tim?

296
00:23:25,292 --> 00:23:26,894
- The shower curtain.

297
00:23:26,918 --> 00:23:28,268
- It's some guy who says
he has the shower curtain.

298
00:23:28,292 --> 00:23:30,101
- What's his name?

299
00:23:30,125 --> 00:23:31,059
- Uh who may I ask is calling?

300
00:23:31,083 --> 00:23:33,268
- This here is Willy.

301
00:23:33,292 --> 00:23:34,268
- Well hi Willy.

302
00:23:34,292 --> 00:23:35,518
Yeah that's ours, where
did you find it?

303
00:23:35,542 --> 00:23:37,685
- That's tough to say.

304
00:23:37,709 --> 00:23:39,226
- Well why is that?

305
00:23:39,250 --> 00:23:40,560
- Is there a reward?

306
00:23:40,584 --> 00:23:42,351
- Ah, he wants to know
if there's a reward.

307
00:23:42,375 --> 00:23:45,292
- I have 20 dollars.

308
00:23:45,792 --> 00:23:46,935
- How's 20 dollars?

309
00:23:46,959 --> 00:23:48,393
- How's 200?

310
00:23:48,417 --> 00:23:49,894
- 200?

311
00:23:49,918 --> 00:23:51,268
Are you crazy, we're not
gonna give you 200 dollars

312
00:23:51,292 --> 00:23:53,518
for a shower curtain.

313
00:23:53,542 --> 00:23:55,375
- Hi Willy this is Tim.

314
00:23:56,167 --> 00:23:57,584
Hi, yeah, how are
you doing today?

315
00:23:58,876 --> 00:24:01,643
Super, look can I just
ask you one question?

316
00:24:01,667 --> 00:24:04,918
How do you feel about CO2
powered grenade tipped

317
00:24:05,542 --> 00:24:07,226
harpoons?

318
00:24:07,250 --> 00:24:08,935
No, it's a device used to
brutally murder whales,

319
00:24:08,959 --> 00:24:10,976
and do you know who invented it?

320
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,268
Evil scientists.

321
00:24:12,292 --> 00:24:13,918
We are good scientists, Willy,

322
00:24:14,292 --> 00:24:15,602
and we're about to unlock
one of the greatest

323
00:24:15,626 --> 00:24:16,768
scientific mysteries
of all time.

324
00:24:16,792 --> 00:24:18,351
Alternate dimensions.

325
00:24:18,375 --> 00:24:19,768
- Tim, give me the phone.

326
00:24:19,792 --> 00:24:21,185
- But we can't do it without
that shower curtain.

327
00:24:21,209 --> 00:24:23,059
Now, unlike evil scientists,

328
00:24:23,083 --> 00:24:24,268
we don't have a lot of money.

329
00:24:24,292 --> 00:24:25,976
Harpoons, guns, tanks,
these inventions

330
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,894
have done nothing but bring
sadness to this world,

331
00:24:27,918 --> 00:24:30,143
but, if you help us
Willy, the entire planet

332
00:24:30,167 --> 00:24:33,459
will be lining up
to shake your hand.

333
00:24:37,042 --> 00:24:40,250
Hello?

334
00:24:41,292 --> 00:24:44,643
Uh, I'm sorry what?

335
00:24:46,042 --> 00:24:49,125
Yeah, yeah, I'll help
you pick one out.

336
00:24:51,292 --> 00:24:52,709
I'll see you then.

337
00:24:55,667 --> 00:24:56,667
- So?

338
00:24:58,876 --> 00:25:00,268
- He says that 20 dollars
is fine, but if we become

339
00:25:00,292 --> 00:25:01,477
famous and go on TV,
he wants us to buy him

340
00:25:01,501 --> 00:25:03,101
a tuxedo.

341
00:25:03,125 --> 00:25:04,351
He's in Jersey, he wants us
to meet him at exit 85A,

342
00:25:04,375 --> 00:25:07,268
at Leo's Diner in two hours.

343
00:25:07,292 --> 00:25:09,584
- From now?

344
00:25:10,292 --> 00:25:12,252
- Yeah, do you wanna get
rid of this thing or not?

345
00:25:27,792 --> 00:25:31,685
- That was pretty cool the
way you closed the deal

346
00:25:31,709 --> 00:25:33,268
with that guy.

347
00:25:33,292 --> 00:25:34,268
- It's my job.

348
00:25:34,292 --> 00:25:35,751
One of my jobs anyway.

349
00:25:36,542 --> 00:25:37,685
- Oh right, at Sandwich Town.

350
00:25:37,709 --> 00:25:39,935
- Sandwich City, actually.

351
00:25:39,959 --> 00:25:41,759
Yeah it sucks, I know,
but I'm saving my money

352
00:25:42,250 --> 00:25:43,935
to get on the Sea Savior.

353
00:25:43,959 --> 00:25:45,542
I'm gonna help take
down the Obagi Maru.

354
00:25:46,501 --> 00:25:48,709
No more nickel and diming
people on the streets

355
00:25:49,792 --> 00:25:51,018
for donations.

356
00:25:51,042 --> 00:25:52,334
Cut the monster off at the head.

357
00:25:53,584 --> 00:25:55,334
- How long have you been saving?

358
00:25:56,375 --> 00:25:57,602
- Been three years in October.

359
00:25:57,626 --> 00:25:59,334
- It must cost a lot
to be an activist huh?

360
00:26:01,042 --> 00:26:02,894
- Yup.

361
00:26:02,918 --> 00:26:04,685
But who knows what doors
this curtain thing

362
00:26:04,709 --> 00:26:05,894
is gonna open up, right?

363
00:26:05,918 --> 00:26:07,292
- I guess.

364
00:26:08,709 --> 00:26:09,477
- You guess?

365
00:26:09,501 --> 00:26:11,083
We're gonna be on the
cover on magazines

366
00:26:11,375 --> 00:26:12,685
before the year is out.

367
00:26:17,292 --> 00:26:18,751
- Let's just go.

368
00:26:20,667 --> 00:26:22,560
- Maybe he's just
running a little late.

369
00:26:22,584 --> 00:26:24,894
- He's not here Tim.

370
00:26:24,918 --> 00:26:26,351
Nobody is here, the
only kind of person

371
00:26:26,375 --> 00:26:28,101
that would hang around here

372
00:26:28,125 --> 00:26:29,250
would be a complete lunatic.

373
00:26:30,501 --> 00:26:31,709
Someone's in there.

374
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,417
- In there, really?

375
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:42,185
- Tim!

376
00:26:42,209 --> 00:26:43,501
You know, I, I
think I was wrong,

377
00:26:45,209 --> 00:26:46,477
I didn't see anything,
come on let's go.

378
00:26:46,501 --> 00:26:48,435
- You saw something,
maybe we can look around

379
00:26:48,459 --> 00:26:49,959
the corner.

380
00:26:56,417 --> 00:27:00,268
- Tim come on, this is
stupid, let's just go.

381
00:27:06,292 --> 00:27:09,810
- I'm gonna take a look inside.

382
00:27:09,834 --> 00:27:11,292
- Tim!

383
00:27:12,292 --> 00:27:13,292
Tim, don't go in there!

384
00:27:14,792 --> 00:27:16,518
- Why not, it's
just an old diner,

385
00:27:16,542 --> 00:27:18,018
I'm just gonna take a look.

386
00:27:18,042 --> 00:27:19,417
We've come this far
already, right?

387
00:27:30,417 --> 00:27:32,297
Yeah Danni you're right
there's nobody in there.

388
00:27:42,167 --> 00:27:45,268
Is that him?

389
00:27:45,292 --> 00:27:46,459
- I don't know.

390
00:27:47,876 --> 00:27:48,876
- Ask him.

391
00:27:52,250 --> 00:27:55,268
- Are you Willy?

392
00:27:55,292 --> 00:27:56,709
- Are you the shower
curtain people?

393
00:27:57,542 --> 00:27:59,292
- Yeah, I'm Danni
and this is Tim.

394
00:27:59,876 --> 00:28:02,059
- Hi.

395
00:28:02,083 --> 00:28:03,584
- Well you don't look
like scientists.

396
00:28:04,250 --> 00:28:05,834
- What do scientists look like?

397
00:28:10,292 --> 00:28:13,626
- Show him the video.

398
00:28:20,375 --> 00:28:21,685
- Goddamn!

399
00:28:21,709 --> 00:28:23,268
You are scientists!

400
00:28:23,292 --> 00:28:24,477
Frankie is gonna love this!

401
00:28:24,501 --> 00:28:27,059
- Okay Willy, do you
have the shower curtain?

402
00:28:27,083 --> 00:28:28,935
- Yes ma'am, I got
it safe around back!

403
00:28:28,959 --> 00:28:31,209
- Oh?

404
00:28:31,834 --> 00:28:32,935
- Come over, I'll show you!

405
00:28:32,959 --> 00:28:34,125
- I don't like this one bit.

406
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,292
- Come on, he's harmless!

407
00:28:41,375 --> 00:28:42,375
- It's in there.

408
00:28:45,334 --> 00:28:46,334
You got that 20 dollars?

409
00:28:48,918 --> 00:28:50,334
- Yeah.

410
00:28:54,626 --> 00:28:58,250
- Be careful, it's stinky.

411
00:29:06,375 --> 00:29:09,834
- Is it in there?

412
00:29:18,042 --> 00:29:19,976
It worked.

413
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,250
- It stinks.

414
00:29:23,292 --> 00:29:25,435
- I told you, that's snot
junk was on when I found it.

415
00:29:25,459 --> 00:29:27,292
- What, you mean you
didn't find it here?

416
00:29:29,292 --> 00:29:30,852
- Nope.

417
00:29:30,876 --> 00:29:31,768
- Then where?

418
00:29:31,792 --> 00:29:32,976
- In a creek.

419
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,584
- Well then we have
to go to this creek,

420
00:29:34,834 --> 00:29:36,083
can you take us there?

421
00:29:36,292 --> 00:29:37,751
- You never said
nothing on the phone

422
00:29:40,042 --> 00:29:41,042
about going nowhere.

423
00:29:45,459 --> 00:29:49,268
- Do you think he's
still in there?

424
00:29:49,292 --> 00:29:50,602
- Yeah, why wouldn't he be?

425
00:29:50,626 --> 00:29:52,386
- I don't know, he's not
the most stable guy,

426
00:29:52,876 --> 00:29:54,310
maybe he ran off or something?

427
00:29:54,334 --> 00:29:56,268
- Well if he did, we
always have plan B.

428
00:29:56,292 --> 00:29:58,542
- What's plan B?

429
00:29:59,292 --> 00:30:00,393
- I'm glad you asked.

430
00:30:00,417 --> 00:30:01,852
It's something I
thought of last night.

431
00:30:01,876 --> 00:30:03,643
Remember those soy sauce packets

432
00:30:03,667 --> 00:30:04,976
that we were talking
about before?

433
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,268
- Yeah.

434
00:30:06,292 --> 00:30:07,101
- Well...

435
00:30:07,125 --> 00:30:08,268
- Sorry, had to hook
the new syrup up

436
00:30:08,292 --> 00:30:10,101
to the doohickey.

437
00:30:10,125 --> 00:30:11,560
Want some?

438
00:30:11,584 --> 00:30:12,727
- No.
- I'm good.

439
00:30:12,751 --> 00:30:13,602
- Suit yourselves.

440
00:30:13,626 --> 00:30:15,506
- So, Willy, now that
you've done your shopping,

441
00:30:15,918 --> 00:30:17,685
you mind showing
us to the creek.

442
00:30:17,709 --> 00:30:19,435
- Oh I'll show you the creek.

443
00:30:19,459 --> 00:30:21,709
I'm gonna you show everything
you wanna see, don't worry.

444
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,920
- Willy I don't think I
can have that in the car.

445
00:30:25,918 --> 00:30:28,125
- Don't worry, it's an old
trick Frankie taught me.

446
00:30:28,501 --> 00:30:30,292
Take a ride out of
here, keep going

447
00:30:32,292 --> 00:30:33,334
until you see an old barn.

448
00:30:52,626 --> 00:30:56,292
- How far did you say
after that barn?

449
00:30:56,542 --> 00:30:58,292
- We're real close.

450
00:31:00,042 --> 00:31:01,922
- So Willy, how close is
the creek to your home?

451
00:31:02,334 --> 00:31:05,727
- The creek is my home.

452
00:31:05,751 --> 00:31:07,602
- Oh.

453
00:31:07,626 --> 00:31:08,751
Does Frankie live there too?

454
00:31:11,375 --> 00:31:13,935
Why is that funny?

455
00:31:13,959 --> 00:31:15,292
- Frankie hates the creek.

456
00:31:15,918 --> 00:31:17,685
It spooks him something nasty.

457
00:31:24,459 --> 00:31:28,226
- All right Willy,
that's enough.

458
00:31:28,250 --> 00:31:30,000
I said that's enough.

459
00:31:30,209 --> 00:31:31,959
What?

460
00:31:33,292 --> 00:31:34,292
What?!

461
00:31:35,292 --> 00:31:36,268
- Stop.

462
00:31:36,292 --> 00:31:37,417
- Why, is this it?

463
00:31:39,667 --> 00:31:42,935
Stop the car.

464
00:31:46,375 --> 00:31:48,417
Willy is this it?

465
00:31:50,792 --> 00:31:51,792
- Danni, Danni!

466
00:31:54,209 --> 00:31:55,709
Shit!

467
00:32:14,959 --> 00:32:18,542
Well, at least you
found the creek.

468
00:32:19,250 --> 00:32:21,417
Do you see him?

469
00:32:22,417 --> 00:32:23,876
- He's probably
passed out somewhere.

470
00:32:30,292 --> 00:32:32,292
- Hey, sorry kids.

471
00:32:33,667 --> 00:32:35,292
Sorry, I just drained my tank.

472
00:32:36,542 --> 00:32:39,751
- Is this where you found
the shower curtain, Willy?

473
00:32:40,626 --> 00:32:42,976
- Uhuh, I find all
kinds of shit in here.

474
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:46,000
- Where exactly did you find it?

475
00:32:46,292 --> 00:32:48,709
- It was right over there.

476
00:32:49,292 --> 00:32:50,834
Or was it over there?

477
00:32:52,292 --> 00:32:54,250
No no, it was over there.

478
00:32:55,292 --> 00:32:57,709
- You go that way,
I'll go the other.

479
00:33:14,167 --> 00:33:17,643
- I sure hope we get on the TV!

480
00:33:17,667 --> 00:33:19,751
Frankie always said I had
a face for the shows.

481
00:33:20,292 --> 00:33:23,209
What you get my cup for?

482
00:33:23,584 --> 00:33:25,292
- It's litter, it's
bad for environment.

483
00:33:25,542 --> 00:33:27,584
- Oh I'm sorry.

484
00:33:27,918 --> 00:33:29,542
- It's fine, just try
not to do it again.

485
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:34,292
- Oops!

486
00:33:38,334 --> 00:33:42,018
Don't worry I'll pick them up.

487
00:33:42,042 --> 00:33:43,751
Hey pick a color.

488
00:33:44,083 --> 00:33:45,351
- What, are you a painter?

489
00:33:45,375 --> 00:33:47,101
- I ain't shit, Frankie taught
me this other trick you see.

490
00:33:47,125 --> 00:33:50,226
- Willy, who is Frankie,
is he your friend?

491
00:33:50,250 --> 00:33:52,918
- I'll tell you if
you pick a color.

492
00:33:53,959 --> 00:33:55,250
- Yellow.

493
00:33:57,250 --> 00:33:58,459
- You picked a great color.

494
00:34:25,083 --> 00:34:26,976
- Oh you don't wanna
be doing that.

495
00:34:28,375 --> 00:34:32,059
- It's Frankie time!

496
00:34:34,918 --> 00:34:36,918
- Tim!

497
00:34:38,125 --> 00:34:39,417
- It comes up out of the ground.

498
00:34:40,292 --> 00:34:42,292
It's kinda like you,.

499
00:34:57,792 --> 00:35:00,268
- Are you okay?

500
00:35:00,292 --> 00:35:01,268
- It's time to go.

501
00:35:01,292 --> 00:35:02,626
- We're gonna leave now Willy.

502
00:35:03,167 --> 00:35:04,584
- Frankie!

503
00:35:09,626 --> 00:35:12,976
Scientists!

504
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,876
Scientists!

505
00:35:18,292 --> 00:35:21,435
Scientists!

506
00:35:22,375 --> 00:35:23,709
Scientists!

507
00:35:25,709 --> 00:35:27,709
Scientists!

508
00:35:38,584 --> 00:35:42,268
Are you guys good scientists,

509
00:35:42,292 --> 00:35:44,292
or bad scientists?

510
00:35:53,042 --> 00:35:56,268
- Are you okay?

511
00:35:56,292 --> 00:35:57,292
- Yeah I'm fine.

512
00:35:58,375 --> 00:35:59,667
What did you find in the creek?

513
00:36:01,667 --> 00:36:03,310
- I don't know, there
was a lot of junk

514
00:36:03,334 --> 00:36:04,976
in those rocks.

515
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,268
The curtain could've floated
downstream from somewhere.

516
00:36:06,292 --> 00:36:08,918
We have to find out where
that somewhere is.

517
00:36:09,292 --> 00:36:11,334
Right?

518
00:36:24,292 --> 00:36:27,518
Thanks.

519
00:36:27,542 --> 00:36:28,768
- I don't think we
should put up anymore

520
00:36:28,792 --> 00:36:29,518
shower curtains, Danni.

521
00:36:29,542 --> 00:36:31,209
- But how else are we
gonna plug the hole?

522
00:36:32,292 --> 00:36:34,101
- I'm not so sure that we can.

523
00:36:34,125 --> 00:36:35,709
- But you, you can't
get cold feet now.

524
00:36:36,292 --> 00:36:38,310
You started this whole thing.

525
00:36:38,334 --> 00:36:40,101
What about plan B?

526
00:36:40,125 --> 00:36:41,602
- No, no, I just
think that we need

527
00:36:41,626 --> 00:36:43,268
another opinion.

528
00:36:43,292 --> 00:36:45,167
You know, like an
expert or something.

529
00:36:45,292 --> 00:36:47,417
- Well there's this girl Beth
that I used to work with

530
00:36:49,292 --> 00:36:52,268
at St. Mary's, her fiancee
is some big wheel

531
00:36:52,292 --> 00:36:54,685
in the Physics
Department at Columbia,

532
00:36:54,709 --> 00:36:56,560
maybe he can help us out?

533
00:36:56,584 --> 00:36:58,101
- Yeah, yeah, I think that
might be the best way to go.

534
00:36:58,125 --> 00:36:59,602
- Okay, I'll give her a call.

535
00:36:59,626 --> 00:37:01,393
- Good, are you gonna be okay?

536
00:37:01,417 --> 00:37:03,375
- Yeah, why wouldn't I be?

537
00:39:09,834 --> 00:39:13,143
- Ssshht...

538
00:39:37,292 --> 00:39:40,643
You're not Bert.

539
00:39:40,667 --> 00:39:41,987
- No, no, no I'm not Bert.

540
00:39:44,626 --> 00:39:48,059
- You're not Bert.

541
00:39:48,083 --> 00:39:49,501
But you've been
putting up curtains.

542
00:40:03,667 --> 00:40:07,059
Bring her here.

543
00:40:07,083 --> 00:40:08,125
- No, no, no!

544
00:40:30,792 --> 00:40:33,852
I won't put up anymore
curtains, I won't.

545
00:40:33,876 --> 00:40:36,250
- Raise your left
hand and swear it.

546
00:40:37,292 --> 00:40:39,292
- I swear I won't put
anymore curtains.

547
00:40:39,959 --> 00:40:42,268
- Good.

548
00:40:42,292 --> 00:40:43,501
- No, no!

549
00:40:55,876 --> 00:40:59,268
You're a part of it now.

550
00:40:59,292 --> 00:41:01,268
Chosen by The Gate,

551
00:41:01,292 --> 00:41:03,268
a sacred oath sealed in flesh.

552
00:41:03,292 --> 00:41:05,560
You violate the oath,

553
00:41:05,584 --> 00:41:07,292
we violate the flesh.

554
00:41:37,876 --> 00:41:41,125
- Danni?

555
00:41:46,709 --> 00:41:50,268
I got my phone back
from the shop.

556
00:41:50,292 --> 00:41:51,918
They erased all my
Whale Saver ringtones,

557
00:41:52,459 --> 00:41:54,292
but I should be able
to get those back.

558
00:41:59,125 --> 00:42:02,518
What happened to your hand?

559
00:42:02,542 --> 00:42:04,042
- I burned it.

560
00:42:04,959 --> 00:42:06,292
- Oh, looks painful.

561
00:42:07,501 --> 00:42:09,042
So did you talk to
that Beth chick yet?

562
00:42:12,876 --> 00:42:13,876
- I got a new lead.

563
00:42:16,292 --> 00:42:17,584
- What is it?

564
00:42:18,292 --> 00:42:19,351
- Bert.

565
00:42:19,375 --> 00:42:20,542
- Who's Bert?

566
00:42:21,751 --> 00:42:22,751
- A fucking weirdo.

567
00:42:23,292 --> 00:42:24,709
Batshit Bert.

568
00:42:25,292 --> 00:42:26,584
In and out of psych wards,

569
00:42:27,501 --> 00:42:29,768
always seeing things.

570
00:42:29,792 --> 00:42:31,268
Talking to himself.

571
00:42:31,292 --> 00:42:32,959
You know the type.

572
00:42:33,959 --> 00:42:35,226
- Well what happened,
why did he move out?

573
00:42:35,250 --> 00:42:37,292
- He never moved out.

574
00:42:37,542 --> 00:42:38,918
- No?

575
00:42:39,292 --> 00:42:40,375
- Shit you guys don't know?

576
00:42:41,250 --> 00:42:42,876
He took a goddamn
razor to his neck.

577
00:42:43,292 --> 00:42:45,268
In the tub, fucking
selfish if you ask me.

578
00:42:45,292 --> 00:42:48,125
Hell of a cleanup job.

579
00:42:48,709 --> 00:42:49,989
Would you know I
was the only one

580
00:42:52,292 --> 00:42:53,393
at that fucker's funeral?

581
00:42:53,417 --> 00:42:54,935
Not another soul.

582
00:42:54,959 --> 00:42:56,268
They didn't even serve
sandwiches or anything.

583
00:42:56,292 --> 00:42:58,334
- Did he leave anything
behind, a note or something?

584
00:42:59,292 --> 00:43:01,334
- No.

585
00:43:02,459 --> 00:43:03,501
I threw all his stuff out.

586
00:43:05,375 --> 00:43:06,375
- What about that?

587
00:43:10,292 --> 00:43:13,268
- Oh that's just a
few of his books.

588
00:43:13,292 --> 00:43:15,292
I keep it for the titties.

589
00:43:21,292 --> 00:43:23,417
You guys know I want
that back right?

590
00:43:42,375 --> 00:43:46,268
- Only an untainted
membrane will bring

591
00:43:46,292 --> 00:43:48,059
forth The Yonder in
its purest visage.

592
00:43:48,083 --> 00:43:51,268
To keep The Yonder
at bay, The Gate

593
00:43:51,292 --> 00:43:53,250
must be mapped with blood.

594
00:43:53,959 --> 00:43:55,292
The Gate.

595
00:43:57,250 --> 00:43:58,250
- What does that mean?

596
00:43:59,334 --> 00:44:00,417
- Okay you two, time to go,

597
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:04,810
you're freaking me out.

598
00:44:04,834 --> 00:44:05,976
- But the book!

599
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:07,417
- I said, I keep it
for the titties.

600
00:44:08,501 --> 00:44:09,751
- What did he mean by The Gate?

601
00:44:12,250 --> 00:44:14,292
- He?

602
00:44:14,584 --> 00:44:15,584
- The book.

603
00:44:15,792 --> 00:44:17,672
- I don't know, but we
shouldn't be messing with

604
00:44:18,209 --> 00:44:19,310
this alone.

605
00:44:19,334 --> 00:44:21,174
Where's your phone, I'm
gonna call your friend.

606
00:44:24,501 --> 00:44:28,059
- I deleted her number.

607
00:44:28,083 --> 00:44:29,403
- But I thought we agreed...

608
00:44:30,459 --> 00:44:31,685
- What am I gonna say?

609
00:44:31,709 --> 00:44:33,268
My shower curtains
are being sucked

610
00:44:33,292 --> 00:44:35,185
into some alternate
dimension, how you doing?

611
00:44:35,209 --> 00:44:37,268
- It's a start!

612
00:44:37,292 --> 00:44:38,435
- No, she'll just
say that I'm crazy.

613
00:44:38,459 --> 00:44:40,435
- But we have the
footage, the curtain from

614
00:44:40,459 --> 00:44:42,393
the creek, they can run tests,

615
00:44:42,417 --> 00:44:44,268
scientific shit.

616
00:44:44,292 --> 00:44:45,226
- It's not gonna happen.

617
00:44:45,250 --> 00:44:46,268
- Then, what are we gonna do?

618
00:44:46,292 --> 00:44:48,167
- We put up another curtain.

619
00:44:49,083 --> 00:44:50,751
- No, look, just
gimme until morning.

620
00:44:52,125 --> 00:44:55,560
And I'll come up with
something that doesn't

621
00:44:55,584 --> 00:44:56,976
involve putting
up more curtains.

622
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:59,209
You look tired, maybe
you should go back

623
00:44:59,542 --> 00:45:01,894
to your uncle's for a
while, get some rest.

624
00:45:01,918 --> 00:45:03,393
- No, this is my apartment.

625
00:45:03,417 --> 00:45:05,185
I'm not going anywhere.

626
00:45:05,209 --> 00:45:07,268
- Okay, then just promise
me you'll stay away

627
00:45:07,292 --> 00:45:09,268
from this bathroom.

628
00:45:09,292 --> 00:45:10,792
- Sure.

629
00:46:23,083 --> 00:46:26,268
Oh my God...

630
00:47:19,083 --> 00:47:21,542
- Hello?

631
00:47:22,292 --> 00:47:23,292
Danni?

632
00:47:24,667 --> 00:47:25,792
Hey Danni.

633
00:47:31,292 --> 00:47:34,268
Danni?

634
00:47:35,209 --> 00:47:37,143
Good to see you too.

635
00:47:37,167 --> 00:47:38,709
I love what you've
done with the place.

636
00:47:39,626 --> 00:47:40,935
- Now is not a good time, Gus.

637
00:47:40,959 --> 00:47:42,310
I'm in the middle of something.

638
00:47:42,334 --> 00:47:43,727
- So what did you
do with your hand,

639
00:47:43,751 --> 00:47:45,143
is that a fashion statement?

640
00:47:45,167 --> 00:47:46,268
- All these numbers,
they're the key

641
00:47:46,292 --> 00:47:47,894
to everything I just know it.

642
00:47:47,918 --> 00:47:49,584
- What numbers?

643
00:47:50,042 --> 00:47:51,167
- On my curtains.

644
00:47:51,292 --> 00:47:53,000
Here, see for yourself.

645
00:47:56,918 --> 00:47:58,059
I mean do you see?

646
00:47:58,083 --> 00:47:59,268
The numbers that glow,
they mean something,

647
00:47:59,292 --> 00:48:00,727
I just gotta figure
out what it is.

648
00:48:00,751 --> 00:48:02,667
- That's pretty neat.

649
00:48:03,292 --> 00:48:05,059
So what is this, one
of those app thingies?

650
00:48:05,083 --> 00:48:07,167
You got a plate or something?

651
00:48:08,292 --> 00:48:09,876
- When I quit St.
Mary's, you never once

652
00:48:10,584 --> 00:48:12,417
asked why, you know that?

653
00:48:13,083 --> 00:48:14,417
- Well it's because
I didn't think

654
00:48:16,667 --> 00:48:17,976
there was anything
to talk about.

655
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:19,459
You didn't like a
job, and you quit,

656
00:48:19,876 --> 00:48:21,310
I mean that happens
everyday right?

657
00:48:21,334 --> 00:48:23,143
- I wasn't well.

658
00:48:23,167 --> 00:48:24,894
- So where's your TV,
I wanna watch a game.

659
00:48:24,918 --> 00:48:26,792
- I'm not gonna ignore
this Gus, I can't.

660
00:48:28,334 --> 00:48:30,209
- So uhm...

661
00:48:31,667 --> 00:48:33,125
So what do you want me to do,

662
00:48:35,292 --> 00:48:36,185
you want me to leave?

663
00:48:36,209 --> 00:48:37,435
- I'm saying that sometimes
there are more important

664
00:48:37,459 --> 00:48:39,834
things than beer and donuts.

665
00:50:47,250 --> 00:50:50,292
Uncle Gus?

666
00:50:51,459 --> 00:50:52,459
I come bearing gifts.

667
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:56,918
You know how about a
healthy meal for a change?

668
00:50:58,292 --> 00:51:01,268
You know that guy at
the farmer's market,

669
00:51:01,292 --> 00:51:03,292
he's really not so bad, and
no more bargain shrimp.

670
00:51:03,709 --> 00:51:06,751
Only fresh from now on.

671
00:51:48,167 --> 00:51:51,894
- You have one unheard message.

672
00:51:51,918 --> 00:51:54,334
- Hey kiddo it's me.

673
00:51:54,959 --> 00:51:56,667
What you said before...

674
00:51:57,292 --> 00:51:59,000
Look, I never asked why you left St.
Mary's

675
00:51:59,626 --> 00:52:02,059
because I just didn't
wanna make it worse.

676
00:52:02,083 --> 00:52:04,292
And ever since your mom
died I've been trying

677
00:52:04,792 --> 00:52:06,310
not to make things worse.

678
00:52:06,334 --> 00:52:08,417
The thing is beer and donuts
can't solve everything.

679
00:52:08,792 --> 00:52:11,334
Anyway that video, those numbers

680
00:52:12,292 --> 00:52:13,810
you were talking about, I think
I may have figured 'em out.

681
00:52:13,834 --> 00:52:16,667
These old sailor's eyes might
still be good for something,

682
00:52:17,250 --> 00:52:19,459
give me a call back
and I'll fill you in.

683
00:52:20,042 --> 00:52:22,002
- End of message,
delete, press seven.

684
00:53:02,751 --> 00:53:06,185
- Tim!

685
00:53:06,209 --> 00:53:07,292
Tim!

686
00:53:08,292 --> 00:53:09,334
- What?

687
00:53:09,876 --> 00:53:11,556
- Some chick's here to see you.

688
00:53:14,417 --> 00:53:17,852
- I need your car.

689
00:53:17,876 --> 00:53:19,636
- What are you doing
with all those curtains?

690
00:53:19,918 --> 00:53:21,268
- Coordinates, the numbers
on the bathroom wall

691
00:53:21,292 --> 00:53:22,768
they're coordinates.

692
00:53:22,792 --> 00:53:23,685
- What numbers?

693
00:53:23,709 --> 00:53:24,976
- I worked 'em out and
it's Peekskill, Jersey,

694
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:26,268
just a mile north of that creek.

695
00:53:26,292 --> 00:53:27,935
I'm gonna go up there
and you're gonna

696
00:53:27,959 --> 00:53:29,268
hang these curtains.

697
00:53:29,292 --> 00:53:31,132
- Danni, I don't think
that's such a good idea.

698
00:53:31,417 --> 00:53:33,177
- Do you ever get tired
of being chickenshit?

699
00:53:35,292 --> 00:53:37,501
All that money you've
been saving up

700
00:53:38,417 --> 00:53:39,768
to get out to the Antarctic?

701
00:53:39,792 --> 00:53:41,268
Cut the monster off at the head.

702
00:53:41,292 --> 00:53:43,185
Three years and you
haven't done anything.

703
00:53:43,209 --> 00:53:45,602
You present yourself as
this die-hard activist

704
00:53:45,626 --> 00:53:47,792
but you don't ever fucking act.

705
00:53:57,459 --> 00:54:01,101
I lied to you about my hand.

706
00:54:01,125 --> 00:54:03,375
I can't explain right now,

707
00:54:04,584 --> 00:54:05,894
but my Uncle Gus,

708
00:54:05,918 --> 00:54:08,042
he's dead and it's all my fault.

709
00:54:09,083 --> 00:54:11,292
I'm gonna get to the
bottom of this Tim,

710
00:54:12,417 --> 00:54:14,083
I need your help.

711
00:54:18,542 --> 00:54:21,768
- Danni.

712
00:54:21,792 --> 00:54:23,000
Danni.

713
00:54:25,334 --> 00:54:28,685
Did she leave?

714
00:54:28,709 --> 00:54:30,042
- Uh yeah.

715
00:54:30,417 --> 00:54:31,792
Uh she took your keys too.

716
00:54:32,292 --> 00:54:34,292
- What?

717
00:54:39,083 --> 00:54:40,375
- Don't be mad, I gotta do this.

718
00:54:42,584 --> 00:54:44,459
- I have an app on my phone

719
00:54:45,292 --> 00:54:46,602
that follows the Obagi Maru.

720
00:54:46,626 --> 00:54:48,542
I tracked their course,

721
00:54:49,292 --> 00:54:50,477
I know the shit they
pull every single day,

722
00:54:50,501 --> 00:54:52,268
but I just can't bring
myself to actually

723
00:54:52,292 --> 00:54:54,268
go out there.

724
00:54:54,292 --> 00:54:55,667
I guess I am chickenshit.

725
00:54:56,292 --> 00:54:58,167
- Tim, I...

726
00:54:59,292 --> 00:55:00,477
- Is it true about
your Uncle Gus?

727
00:55:00,501 --> 00:55:01,751
- Yeah.

728
00:55:02,667 --> 00:55:04,387
- I'll be at your apartment
in half an hour.

729
00:55:29,042 --> 00:55:32,268
- I guess I go east.

730
00:56:27,709 --> 00:56:29,751
I'm here.

731
00:56:30,292 --> 00:56:31,334
- So what's it look like?

732
00:56:33,125 --> 00:56:34,751
- I'm in the middle
of a ditch somewhere,

733
00:56:35,292 --> 00:56:37,143
and there's not much out here.

734
00:56:37,167 --> 00:56:38,584
Are you ready?

735
00:56:50,667 --> 00:56:54,310
- Okay, it's up, shall
I close it now?

736
00:56:54,334 --> 00:56:56,292
- Yeah.

737
00:56:56,501 --> 00:56:57,501
- Danni?

738
00:56:58,250 --> 00:56:59,185
- What?

739
00:56:59,209 --> 00:57:00,292
- Just be careful.

740
00:57:13,292 --> 00:57:14,292
What's happening?

741
00:57:14,709 --> 00:57:15,810
- Ssshht!

742
00:57:15,834 --> 00:57:16,834
- What's happening?!

743
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:20,292
- Nothing, nothing is happening.

744
00:57:23,292 --> 00:57:24,477
- I have a bad feeling
about this Danni,

745
00:57:24,501 --> 00:57:25,976
why don't you just come back?

746
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:27,417
- I must've typed it in wrong,

747
00:57:28,626 --> 00:57:30,209
or the phone screwed up.

748
00:57:34,250 --> 00:57:35,250
I just felt something.

749
00:57:37,542 --> 00:57:39,083
It felt like it came from the...

750
00:57:42,375 --> 00:57:46,292
Something is coming
out of the ground.

751
00:57:50,334 --> 00:57:54,018
- Tell me what you see, Danni.

752
00:57:54,042 --> 00:57:55,542
- It's the shower curtain,

753
00:57:57,292 --> 00:57:58,768
there's something inside it.

754
00:57:58,792 --> 00:58:00,351
Oh God, it smells just
like that other one.

755
00:58:00,375 --> 00:58:02,852
- I don't like this
Danni, just leave.

756
00:58:02,876 --> 00:58:04,709
- I'm gonna go look inside.

757
00:58:12,292 --> 00:58:15,393
- What is it?

758
00:58:15,417 --> 00:58:16,667
- It looks like...

759
00:58:18,959 --> 00:58:20,143
- Danni!

760
00:58:46,626 --> 00:58:48,834
- 911 what's our emergency?

761
00:58:49,292 --> 00:58:51,101
- My friend Danni,
she's in the woods

762
00:58:51,125 --> 00:58:52,351
and something happened.

763
00:58:52,375 --> 00:58:53,602
- Does she need an ambulance?

764
00:58:53,626 --> 00:58:54,852
- I don't know, we were
talking on the phone

765
00:58:54,876 --> 00:58:57,268
and then I heard
screaming and then,

766
00:58:57,292 --> 00:59:00,268
please you just have
to help her now.

767
00:59:00,292 --> 00:59:02,268
- Okay, where did this happen?

768
00:59:02,292 --> 00:59:03,935
- She followed
these coordinates.

769
00:59:03,959 --> 00:59:05,643
- Sir, where...

770
00:59:05,667 --> 00:59:06,393
- 21, dash 14, dash...

771
00:59:06,417 --> 00:59:08,894
No!

772
00:59:08,918 --> 00:59:10,101
- Okay just slow down sir.

773
00:59:10,125 --> 00:59:11,268
Can you tell me an address
or a cross street?

774
00:59:11,292 --> 00:59:13,292
Sir, are you still there?

775
00:59:14,292 --> 00:59:16,292
- I can't find it.

776
00:59:17,042 --> 00:59:18,268
- Okay calm down,
everything is going

777
00:59:18,292 --> 00:59:20,052
to be fine, take a deep
breath and go slowly.

778
00:59:20,250 --> 00:59:22,292
Can you tell me your name?

779
00:59:23,626 --> 00:59:24,852
- We don't have time
for this, we've got

780
00:59:24,876 --> 00:59:25,685
to get to her now.

781
00:59:25,709 --> 00:59:27,268
- Calm down sir,
we can help you,

782
00:59:27,292 --> 00:59:28,935
but we need to
know where she is,

783
00:59:28,959 --> 00:59:30,292
now, what are these coordinates?

784
00:59:31,167 --> 00:59:32,334
Sir?

785
00:59:34,292 --> 00:59:35,059
Are you still there?

786
00:59:35,083 --> 00:59:36,250
Sir?

787
00:59:37,083 --> 00:59:38,083
- I know how to save her.

788
00:59:39,292 --> 00:59:40,292
- Where are we going?

789
01:00:05,292 --> 01:00:08,393
- Dig.

790
01:00:08,417 --> 01:00:09,501
- What for?

791
01:00:11,417 --> 01:00:12,602
- When you're done
with the first hole,

792
01:00:12,626 --> 01:00:13,643
start another.

793
01:00:43,042 --> 01:00:46,435
- So these, they're all me?

794
01:00:46,459 --> 01:00:48,417
- Only one chose by The Gate

795
01:00:49,125 --> 01:00:50,935
can bring forth from The Yonder.

796
01:00:56,292 --> 01:00:57,834
- So you're telling
me, that every time

797
01:01:00,083 --> 01:01:02,560
I hang a shower curtain,
my bathroom wall

798
01:01:02,584 --> 01:01:05,292
sends it to that ditch over
there and gives birth to,

799
01:01:06,209 --> 01:01:08,292
well, that.

800
01:01:09,292 --> 01:01:10,518
- You gave birth to that.

801
01:01:10,542 --> 01:01:12,334
- Huh?

802
01:01:13,167 --> 01:01:14,018
- You raised the membrane.

803
01:01:14,042 --> 01:01:15,959
You violated the oath.

804
01:01:16,292 --> 01:01:18,167
- Oh fuck that, let's
just go back to

805
01:01:18,751 --> 01:01:20,268
my apartment and burn
it down right now.

806
01:01:20,292 --> 01:01:22,685
- The Gate will protect itself.

807
01:01:22,709 --> 01:01:24,626
Its wrath shines
brightest on those who

808
01:01:25,292 --> 01:01:27,268
try to destroy it.

809
01:01:38,959 --> 01:01:42,226
- What now?

810
01:01:51,167 --> 01:01:52,852
No, but The Gate, it chose me!

811
01:01:52,876 --> 01:01:55,560
- And The Gate will
choose another.

812
01:01:55,584 --> 01:01:57,417
Your chapter is closed.

813
01:01:59,792 --> 01:02:02,268
It's already chosen.

814
01:03:14,375 --> 01:03:16,626
It's been.

815
01:03:38,959 --> 01:03:42,268
- What the hell are you?

816
01:03:42,292 --> 01:03:43,709
Talk to me!

817
01:03:44,209 --> 01:03:45,351
Talk to me!

818
01:04:49,375 --> 01:04:51,459
- Hi this is Tim, I'm
not here right now,

819
01:04:53,334 --> 01:04:55,268
but please leave a message.

820
01:04:55,292 --> 01:04:57,101
And remember, save the whales!

821
01:04:57,125 --> 01:04:59,292
- Tim, I'm coming back.

822
01:05:43,167 --> 01:05:46,292
Tim?

823
01:05:55,042 --> 01:05:58,268
Tim?

824
01:06:01,542 --> 01:06:02,792
Tim are you in there?

825
01:07:06,542 --> 01:07:09,292
Plan B.

826
01:07:52,542 --> 01:07:53,876
No...

827
01:08:02,292 --> 01:08:05,292
No.

828
01:09:36,042 --> 01:09:39,268
- Miss Smith?

829
01:09:39,292 --> 01:09:40,501
I'm here to check that toilet.

830
01:10:02,626 --> 01:10:05,876
Shit...

831
01:10:32,292 --> 01:10:36,143
I told her to stick
to taking baths.
