1
00:01:12,072 --> 00:01:14,030
You know that tree
belongs in a compost heap,

2
00:01:14,074 --> 00:01:15,510
not at the front in the store.

3
00:01:15,553 --> 00:01:17,468
Quiet, she will hear you.

4
00:01:17,512 --> 00:01:19,752
Someone's been drinkin'
a little too much eggnog again?

5
00:01:19,818 --> 00:01:22,082
A, there is no such thing
as too much eggnog

6
00:01:22,125 --> 00:01:24,736
and B, Geraldine will make a
perfect Christmas tree one year.

7
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:26,651
Geraldine?

8
00:01:26,695 --> 00:01:28,305
Geraldine.

9
00:01:28,349 --> 00:01:32,092
She just uh, needs a little time
and a little TLC.

10
00:01:32,134 --> 00:01:34,244
You know my mom loved every tree
that came through here.

11
00:01:34,268 --> 00:01:35,965
- And every human.
- And I am not about to

12
00:01:36,008 --> 00:01:38,576
let her legacy go
now that I am running things.

13
00:01:38,620 --> 00:01:40,336
We got decorations up
the day after Thanksgiving,

14
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:41,884
just like she did.

15
00:01:41,926 --> 00:01:43,799
Hot cocoa and cookies
for the shoppers,

16
00:01:43,842 --> 00:01:45,235
just like she did.

17
00:01:45,279 --> 00:01:47,281
And now, I'm gonna give
Geraldine here a shot

18
00:01:47,324 --> 00:01:49,152
because that is exactly
what she would do.

19
00:01:49,196 --> 00:01:52,112
She'd be proud of you, Ang.

20
00:01:52,155 --> 00:01:53,330
I hope so.

21
00:01:53,374 --> 00:01:55,115
I know so.

22
00:01:55,158 --> 00:01:58,422
All the work you've put into
this place since last Christmas.

23
00:01:58,466 --> 00:02:00,381
She made Christmas
so special for everyone,

24
00:02:00,424 --> 00:02:02,731
I just really wanna
honor her this year.

25
00:02:02,774 --> 00:02:04,907
Well, if I didn't work here,

26
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:07,214
I'd think she was
still running this place.

27
00:02:07,257 --> 00:02:09,868
It's just like she left it.

28
00:02:09,912 --> 00:02:11,870
Right down to our aprons.

29
00:02:11,914 --> 00:02:13,524
I told you Blair,
the aprons stay.

30
00:02:13,568 --> 00:02:15,961
- They're itchy...
- Ugh.

31
00:02:16,005 --> 00:02:18,573
Besides, you know
I'd rock a jewel tone.

32
00:02:18,616 --> 00:02:20,531
I know...

33
00:02:21,271 --> 00:02:23,447
Ooh, any good mail?

34
00:02:23,491 --> 00:02:25,014
The best mail.

35
00:02:25,057 --> 00:02:26,276
The official schedule for the

36
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:27,775
Greenpine Grove Town Square
Christmas Eve

37
00:02:27,799 --> 00:02:30,411
Festival of Lights.
Festival of Lights.

38
00:02:30,454 --> 00:02:32,326
Really need
a catchier name for that.

39
00:02:32,369 --> 00:02:33,978
Yeah.

40
00:02:34,023 --> 00:02:35,416
Well, don't leave me hanging.

41
00:02:35,459 --> 00:02:37,220
We've got hot chocolates
from around the world.

42
00:02:37,244 --> 00:02:38,680
I'm here for it.

43
00:02:38,723 --> 00:02:41,161
- Madlib Christmas carols.
- Already laughing.

44
00:02:41,204 --> 00:02:42,553
Make your own gingerbread house.

45
00:02:42,597 --> 00:02:43,902
Aww, Dad's favorite.

46
00:02:43,946 --> 00:02:45,382
And the tree decorating contest

47
00:02:45,426 --> 00:02:46,905
for the lighting of town square.

48
00:02:46,949 --> 00:02:49,256
And Mom's favorite.

49
00:02:49,299 --> 00:02:52,302
We loved the tree lighting.

50
00:02:52,346 --> 00:02:56,088
Well, speaking of trees,
it looks like we have a shopper.

51
00:02:56,132 --> 00:02:59,135
Ooh, I'm on it.

52
00:02:59,179 --> 00:03:01,268
Keep an eye on her, will ya?

53
00:03:01,311 --> 00:03:03,226
I don't think
she's goin' anywhere.

54
00:03:03,270 --> 00:03:06,098
Oh, I was talking to Geraldine.

55
00:03:08,927 --> 00:03:10,973
Hello there,
can I help you find something?

56
00:03:11,016 --> 00:03:12,844
Yes please, I need a tree.

57
00:03:12,888 --> 00:03:14,344
Oh, well you came
to the right place.

58
00:03:14,368 --> 00:03:15,978
What kind of tree
are you looking for?

59
00:03:16,021 --> 00:03:18,110
Well, I've never
bought a tree before.

60
00:03:18,154 --> 00:03:21,244
Well, I can definitely
help you find the perfect tree.

61
00:03:21,288 --> 00:03:23,942
I'm thinking a tree that has
a lot of space underneath

62
00:03:23,986 --> 00:03:26,138
'cause I can tell Santa's
gonna bring you a lot of gifts.

63
00:03:26,162 --> 00:03:27,859
Well, it shouldn't be too big

64
00:03:27,903 --> 00:03:30,035
'cause it has to fit
on the top of the car.

65
00:03:30,079 --> 00:03:32,255
Ooh, boy,
this could take a while.

66
00:03:32,299 --> 00:03:34,430
Do you need a cookie
while you shop?

67
00:03:35,998 --> 00:03:38,324
So, who're you shopping with?
Does someone else need a cookie?

68
00:03:38,348 --> 00:03:39,828
They definitely do.

69
00:03:42,526 --> 00:03:45,050
Or maybe some hot chocolate.

70
00:03:46,008 --> 00:03:48,966
- David.
- Hey, Angie.

71
00:03:49,011 --> 00:03:50,839
You know her?

72
00:03:50,882 --> 00:03:52,841
Uh, Angie and I
used to be friends.

73
00:03:52,884 --> 00:03:55,191
Used to be?
Ouch.

74
00:03:55,235 --> 00:03:56,975
Uh, what are you doing here?

75
00:03:57,019 --> 00:03:58,760
I haven't seen you
since graduation.

76
00:03:58,803 --> 00:04:00,675
Uh, we're home for Christmas.

77
00:04:00,718 --> 00:04:02,590
I'm working remotely
for a couple of weeks,

78
00:04:02,633 --> 00:04:04,461
staying at my sister's
and we needed a tree

79
00:04:04,505 --> 00:04:06,420
so, I knew where we had to come.

80
00:04:06,463 --> 00:04:08,770
Happiest trees in town.

81
00:04:08,813 --> 00:04:10,859
How can a tree be happy?

82
00:04:10,902 --> 00:04:13,253
Well, let me show you.
Come on.

83
00:04:16,168 --> 00:04:18,432
Abigail, Eleanor, Miranda.

84
00:04:18,475 --> 00:04:20,825
Ladies, I'd like you to meet
David and uh,

85
00:04:20,869 --> 00:04:21,976
I'm sorry,
I didn't get your name.

86
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,045
Gabby.

87
00:04:23,088 --> 00:04:24,307
That's a beautiful name.

88
00:04:24,351 --> 00:04:25,787
I'm named after my mom.

89
00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:28,050
So am I, I'm Angie.

90
00:04:28,093 --> 00:04:29,704
So you named your trees?

91
00:04:29,747 --> 00:04:30,985
Well, that's what
makes them happy.

92
00:04:31,009 --> 00:04:33,577
You gotta treat them
like they're family.

93
00:04:33,621 --> 00:04:36,580
We planted Abigail here,
when I graduated high school.

94
00:04:36,624 --> 00:04:38,756
Eleanor was to celebrate
our new greenhouse

95
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:41,281
and uh, old Miranda over there,

96
00:04:41,324 --> 00:04:43,805
well, we plated her after
I got my first broken heart.

97
00:04:43,848 --> 00:04:45,348
My mom always said
there was no better way

98
00:04:45,372 --> 00:04:47,939
to celebrate or be sad,
than planting a tree.

99
00:04:47,983 --> 00:04:50,028
How is your mom?

100
00:04:50,072 --> 00:04:53,423
Uh, she actually passed away
last Christmas.

101
00:04:53,467 --> 00:04:55,207
Angie, I'm so sorry.

102
00:04:55,251 --> 00:04:56,818
Your mom was a wonderful lady.

103
00:04:56,861 --> 00:04:59,734
Definitely planted
a lot of trees.

104
00:04:59,777 --> 00:05:01,823
Gabby here
lost her mom two years ago.

105
00:05:01,866 --> 00:05:04,260
I'm so sorry to hear that.

106
00:05:04,304 --> 00:05:05,803
Well, if your mom
was anything like mine,

107
00:05:05,827 --> 00:05:09,309
I know she's definitely
smiling down on you right now.

108
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:12,964
I think Abigail here
is telling me

109
00:05:13,008 --> 00:05:14,879
she wants to go home with you,
what do you say?

110
00:05:14,923 --> 00:05:18,143
Yeah?
Let's go grab some rope, okay?

111
00:05:24,976 --> 00:05:27,022
This place is
exactly how I remembered it.

112
00:05:27,065 --> 00:05:28,850
Oh, I try to
keep things the same.

113
00:05:28,893 --> 00:05:31,331
Yeah, exactly the same.

114
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:34,638
- How long are you in town?
- Just for Christmas.

115
00:05:34,682 --> 00:05:36,268
We're heading back to Florida
in January.

116
00:05:36,292 --> 00:05:38,250
Oh well, that's a...

117
00:05:38,294 --> 00:05:41,123
Uh, warmer.

118
00:05:41,166 --> 00:05:43,212
Tell Lily we said hi.

119
00:05:43,255 --> 00:05:44,648
I will.

120
00:05:44,692 --> 00:05:45,885
It was nice to meet you, Gabby.

121
00:05:45,909 --> 00:05:47,216
Thank you for the tree.

122
00:05:47,259 --> 00:05:48,889
Of course, take good care
of Abigail, okay?

123
00:05:48,913 --> 00:05:50,567
I will.

124
00:05:55,398 --> 00:05:57,357
- What?
- What do you mean, what?

125
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:58,836
David Mitchell came to see you.

126
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:00,925
David Mitchell
came to buy a tree.

127
00:06:00,969 --> 00:06:02,318
From you.

128
00:06:02,362 --> 00:06:04,538
I haven't seen him
in like ten years.

129
00:06:04,581 --> 00:06:06,322
You heard him,
he's just here for Christmas.

130
00:06:06,366 --> 00:06:07,715
They're leaving in January.

131
00:06:07,758 --> 00:06:10,718
So, probably won't even see them
before they go.

132
00:06:10,761 --> 00:06:12,241
But you wouldn't mind
if you did.

133
00:06:13,373 --> 00:06:14,983
Okay, don't you have inventory?

134
00:06:15,026 --> 00:06:17,332
It's time I do inventory.

135
00:06:27,256 --> 00:06:28,475
There we go...

136
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:34,219
Aunt Lily, we got a tree.

137
00:06:34,263 --> 00:06:36,308
I see that.
Did you pick out a good one?

138
00:06:36,352 --> 00:06:38,093
Mm-hmm, this is Abigail.

139
00:06:38,136 --> 00:06:39,573
Abigail?

140
00:06:39,616 --> 00:06:41,923
Daddy's friend Angie
helped us pick her out.

141
00:06:41,966 --> 00:06:43,577
Angie?

142
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:46,449
You drove all the way out
to Waldron's Nursery?

143
00:06:46,493 --> 00:06:48,277
They have the happiest trees.

144
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:51,498
Exactly, you wouldn't want us
to get an unhappy one, would ya?

145
00:06:51,541 --> 00:06:54,370
- Can we bring Abigail inside?
- Sure, yeah.

146
00:06:54,414 --> 00:06:56,067
I think the tree
can stay outside.

147
00:06:56,111 --> 00:06:58,287
We have to take it
with us tomorrow.

148
00:06:58,330 --> 00:07:00,245
Come on.

149
00:07:02,944 --> 00:07:04,380
I'm home.

150
00:07:04,424 --> 00:07:06,643
Hey.

151
00:07:06,687 --> 00:07:09,559
Ooh, what is this?

152
00:07:09,603 --> 00:07:12,170
This is Stone Ginge.

153
00:07:12,214 --> 00:07:15,913
Wow dad, this might even beat
your Ginge-mahal from last year.

154
00:07:15,957 --> 00:07:18,133
Better pace yourself, you're
gonna run outta landmarks.

155
00:07:18,176 --> 00:07:20,527
Well, if I do,

156
00:07:20,570 --> 00:07:23,399
I'll just start
sculpting presidents.

157
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:25,575
Ginge Washington,
Thomas Gingerson.

158
00:07:25,619 --> 00:07:27,248
Maybe we'll find you
some more landmarks.

159
00:07:27,272 --> 00:07:28,839
Ha, ha.

160
00:07:28,883 --> 00:07:30,319
How was the nursery today?

161
00:07:30,362 --> 00:07:32,669
You will never guess
who stopped by.

162
00:07:32,713 --> 00:07:34,149
- Hmm?
- David Mitchell.

163
00:07:34,192 --> 00:07:35,498
David Mitchell?

164
00:07:35,542 --> 00:07:37,152
He's home for Christmas.

165
00:07:37,195 --> 00:07:39,435
And I got to meet his daughter,
she is such a sweetheart.

166
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:41,983
Hmm, that's nice.

167
00:07:44,115 --> 00:07:45,856
Dad, why is Aunt Joan's
ceramic tree

168
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:47,205
over here, in the corner?

169
00:07:47,249 --> 00:07:48,772
I thought it looked nice there.

170
00:07:48,816 --> 00:07:51,471
You know that we always
put it in the window.

171
00:07:51,514 --> 00:07:53,211
Mom likes the...

172
00:07:55,431 --> 00:07:57,041
The way it lights up the window.

173
00:07:58,521 --> 00:07:59,740
I know, Angie.

174
00:08:01,045 --> 00:08:02,830
I miss her too.

175
00:08:04,266 --> 00:08:06,374
But your mom would want us
to make the most of Christmas,

176
00:08:06,398 --> 00:08:07,965
it was her favorite.

177
00:08:08,009 --> 00:08:10,925
I know.
I just don't wanna change

178
00:08:10,968 --> 00:08:12,840
too many of our traditions
this year.

179
00:08:12,883 --> 00:08:15,843
Not when everything else
feels different.

180
00:08:19,107 --> 00:08:21,065
Speaking of traditions...

181
00:08:21,109 --> 00:08:22,850
Ah, the Greenpine Grove

182
00:08:22,893 --> 00:08:25,243
Town Square Christmas Eve
Festival of Lights.

183
00:08:25,287 --> 00:08:27,768
- They need a new name for that.
- Yeah.

184
00:08:27,811 --> 00:08:29,572
Are you entering
the gingerbread contest again?

185
00:08:29,596 --> 00:08:30,814
Oh yeah, of course.

186
00:08:30,858 --> 00:08:32,686
The Stone Ginge here
is just practice.

187
00:08:34,121 --> 00:08:35,645
You know, it's...

188
00:08:35,688 --> 00:08:37,908
It's hard to think about
the Christmas tree lighting,

189
00:08:37,952 --> 00:08:39,909
without your mom.

190
00:08:39,953 --> 00:08:41,956
You know, she always wanted
to enter the contest.

191
00:08:41,999 --> 00:08:44,567
- Really?
- Yeah.

192
00:08:44,611 --> 00:08:46,569
She said if she could
find the time,

193
00:08:46,613 --> 00:08:47,831
she'd make sure that

194
00:08:47,875 --> 00:08:51,443
a Waldron's Nursery tree
took the top spot.

195
00:08:51,487 --> 00:08:53,576
She was always so busy.

196
00:08:53,620 --> 00:08:56,318
But she took it personally
when a tree she raised

197
00:08:56,361 --> 00:08:58,755
from a seedling didn't win.

198
00:09:00,627 --> 00:09:03,064
She loved those trees.

199
00:09:03,107 --> 00:09:05,980
Happiest trees in town.

200
00:09:06,023 --> 00:09:07,764
Happiest husband.

201
00:09:10,637 --> 00:09:13,857
Come on,
I'll warm you up some dinner.

202
00:09:23,084 --> 00:09:24,825
Hmm...

203
00:09:39,143 --> 00:09:40,580
I entered.

204
00:09:40,623 --> 00:09:42,625
You did.
And very dramatically.

205
00:09:42,669 --> 00:09:43,931
No, not that.

206
00:09:43,974 --> 00:09:45,280
The Greenpine Grove

207
00:09:45,323 --> 00:09:46,649
Town Square Christmas Eve
Festival of Lights,

208
00:09:46,673 --> 00:09:49,589
Christmas tree decorating
contest.

209
00:09:49,632 --> 00:09:51,634
What?
Doesn't that start tomorrow?

210
00:09:51,678 --> 00:09:53,418
Yes, which is why
I need you to help me

211
00:09:53,462 --> 00:09:55,769
come up with a theme right away.

212
00:09:55,812 --> 00:09:58,598
What do we think about
a Christmas love tree?

213
00:10:00,382 --> 00:10:02,384
- I don't get it.
- Yeah, me either.

214
00:10:02,427 --> 00:10:04,081
Okay, if we're gonna win this,

215
00:10:04,125 --> 00:10:05,953
we need to come up with
something really good.

216
00:10:05,996 --> 00:10:09,043
Wait, when did this
become a we thing?

217
00:10:09,086 --> 00:10:11,828
When I registered us
this morning.

218
00:10:11,872 --> 00:10:13,743
Angela Catherine Waldron.

219
00:10:13,787 --> 00:10:15,005
Look, it says teams of two,

220
00:10:15,049 --> 00:10:16,485
who else am I gonna
pair up with?

221
00:10:16,528 --> 00:10:18,748
Literally, anyone.

222
00:10:18,792 --> 00:10:21,751
Angie, you know I have
zero flair for decorating.

223
00:10:21,795 --> 00:10:24,188
Less than zero.

224
00:10:24,232 --> 00:10:25,581
Negative zero.

225
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:27,037
Okay well,
negative zero's not a thing.

226
00:10:27,061 --> 00:10:29,019
And neither is
my decorating ability.

227
00:10:29,063 --> 00:10:30,543
Come on,
I'll put on all the lights,

228
00:10:30,586 --> 00:10:32,109
all you have to do
is just plug it in.

229
00:10:32,153 --> 00:10:35,547
It'll be a piece
of Christmas cake.

230
00:10:37,027 --> 00:10:38,420
Come on, Blair.

231
00:10:38,463 --> 00:10:40,290
You know how I told you
I wanted to find a way

232
00:10:40,335 --> 00:10:42,946
to honor my mom this Christmas?
This is it.

233
00:10:42,990 --> 00:10:46,036
My dad told me my mom always
wanted to enter this contest.

234
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:49,910
So, if we win and they light up
one of her trees in Town Square,

235
00:10:49,953 --> 00:10:51,825
that'll be the perfect way
to remember her.

236
00:10:53,740 --> 00:10:57,004
You're not gonna make me
miss out on that are you?

237
00:10:58,788 --> 00:11:00,921
You know,
this is still a competition.

238
00:11:00,964 --> 00:11:02,574
You're not guaranteed to win.

239
00:11:02,618 --> 00:11:03,837
Well, not technically,

240
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:06,317
but who else loves Christmas
like I do?

241
00:11:06,361 --> 00:11:08,232
- Literally, no one.
- No one.

242
00:11:08,276 --> 00:11:10,800
- Ever.
- Ever.

243
00:11:13,107 --> 00:11:14,761
I just have to
plug the lights in?

244
00:11:14,804 --> 00:11:17,241
That's the spirit.

245
00:11:17,285 --> 00:11:19,461
Okay, we need to come up
with something...

246
00:11:19,504 --> 00:11:21,768
unique, but familiar.

247
00:11:21,811 --> 00:11:23,552
You know, cute, but classy.

248
00:11:23,595 --> 00:11:26,120
Fresh, timeless.

249
00:11:26,163 --> 00:11:31,038
A very uh,
very something Christmas.

250
00:11:31,081 --> 00:11:32,909
Yeah, you know, I think,
I think you got it.

251
00:11:34,781 --> 00:11:37,435
Okay, okay, um...

252
00:11:37,479 --> 00:11:40,961
The Tree Wise Men.

253
00:11:41,004 --> 00:11:43,354
Gold, frankincense and fir?

254
00:11:43,398 --> 00:11:47,794
You are leaning pretty heavy
on the Magi there, Blair.

255
00:11:47,837 --> 00:11:51,145
I've got it.
Flight of the Bumble Tree.

256
00:11:51,188 --> 00:11:54,061
Okay, we're trying to win this.

257
00:11:54,104 --> 00:11:57,455
We can't go in there
with Flight of the Bumble Tree.

258
00:12:01,677 --> 00:12:03,635
Everyone likes bumblebees,
right?

259
00:12:03,679 --> 00:12:06,247
Totally.
High hive...

260
00:12:08,162 --> 00:12:10,294
What, you don't like my pun?

261
00:12:10,338 --> 00:12:12,340
Well, that stings.

262
00:12:12,383 --> 00:12:13,907
- Are you done?
- Almost.

263
00:12:13,950 --> 00:12:15,822
I'm working on something
with a honeycomb over,

264
00:12:15,865 --> 00:12:18,520
but it's not quite there yet.

265
00:12:18,563 --> 00:12:21,479
Then, let's hope
it never arrives.

266
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:24,067
Uh, we have a few minutes
before the decorating starts,

267
00:12:24,091 --> 00:12:25,875
I'm gonna go check out
the competition.

268
00:12:25,919 --> 00:12:29,574
Okay, just bee-have yourself.

269
00:12:29,618 --> 00:12:31,489
- Ugh...
- Okay.

270
00:12:40,107 --> 00:12:41,804
Angie?

271
00:12:41,848 --> 00:12:43,893
David.

272
00:12:43,937 --> 00:12:45,677
I didn't expect to see you here.

273
00:12:45,721 --> 00:12:47,375
Well, I, I didn't either.

274
00:12:47,418 --> 00:12:48,942
Blair and I
signed up last minute.

275
00:12:48,985 --> 00:12:51,596
- Oh.
- How's Abigail?

276
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:54,295
Um, she cried a little
on the first night.

277
00:12:54,338 --> 00:12:56,558
But she's getting used to us.

278
00:12:56,601 --> 00:12:58,429
So you came
to watch the contest?

279
00:12:58,473 --> 00:12:59,996
Oh, uh, sort of.

280
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:02,085
'Cause that's Blair and me's
setup over there.

281
00:13:02,129 --> 00:13:03,846
I'm just scopin' out
the competition in the meantime.

282
00:13:03,870 --> 00:13:05,610
What do you think?

283
00:13:05,654 --> 00:13:07,221
Well, I mean, the balsam fir

284
00:13:07,264 --> 00:13:09,179
was clearly under-watered
in its juvenile years.

285
00:13:09,223 --> 00:13:10,833
Oh, clearly.

286
00:13:10,877 --> 00:13:13,531
And the scotch pine
and Norway spruce are patchy.

287
00:13:13,575 --> 00:13:15,751
That Arizona cypress
is a ringer from out of town,

288
00:13:15,795 --> 00:13:17,903
and the three Douglas firs, mm,
they're just gonna have to

289
00:13:17,927 --> 00:13:19,363
split the Douglas fir vote,
so...

290
00:13:19,407 --> 00:13:22,497
- Rookie mistake.
- Mm-hmm.

291
00:13:22,540 --> 00:13:25,717
To be honest, the only tree
I'm worried about is this one.

292
00:13:25,761 --> 00:13:28,329
It's got strong,
healthy branches.

293
00:13:28,372 --> 00:13:30,287
Piney fragrance.

294
00:13:30,331 --> 00:13:31,680
Pliable needles, I mean,

295
00:13:31,723 --> 00:13:33,595
you can tell this tree
was clearly loved.

296
00:13:33,638 --> 00:13:36,119
Almost seems familiar.

297
00:13:36,163 --> 00:13:38,774
It should, you sold it to us.

298
00:13:38,818 --> 00:13:40,558
- Abigail?
- Yeah.

299
00:13:40,602 --> 00:13:42,430
Oh, wait,
you didn't say anything.

300
00:13:42,473 --> 00:13:44,606
You didn't really
give me the chance.

301
00:13:44,649 --> 00:13:46,303
So you joined the contest?

302
00:13:46,347 --> 00:13:47,957
Uh, yeah.
But not by myself.

303
00:13:48,001 --> 00:13:49,872
Daddy.

304
00:13:49,915 --> 00:13:51,482
Gabby, you remember my friend,
Angie.

305
00:13:51,526 --> 00:13:52,744
- Hi.
- Hi.

306
00:13:52,788 --> 00:13:54,268
We're not really decorators.

307
00:13:54,311 --> 00:13:56,574
But Gabby here
heard about the competition

308
00:13:56,618 --> 00:13:58,663
and begged me to enter,

309
00:13:58,707 --> 00:14:01,057
so we picked out a tree
and here we are.

310
00:14:01,101 --> 00:14:02,537
Well, with Abigail on your side,

311
00:14:02,580 --> 00:14:04,626
I might have to
step up my game a little.

312
00:14:04,669 --> 00:14:06,236
Oh yeah.

313
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:08,320
Really played yourself
on that one there, didn't ya?

314
00:14:15,942 --> 00:14:20,163
Thank you all for joining
the 21st annual Greenpine Grove

315
00:14:20,207 --> 00:14:23,732
Town Square Christmas Eve
Festival of Lights

316
00:14:23,775 --> 00:14:27,431
Christmas Tree Decorating
Contest quarterfinals.

317
00:14:29,346 --> 00:14:31,305
Decorating will begin
in just a minute,

318
00:14:31,348 --> 00:14:33,960
but first,
a reminder of the rules.

319
00:14:34,003 --> 00:14:36,049
There are three rounds
of competition.

320
00:14:36,092 --> 00:14:38,138
First round, freestyle.

321
00:14:38,181 --> 00:14:41,924
Decorate your tree
with the theme of your choice.

322
00:14:41,968 --> 00:14:44,884
Five trees will move on
to the semi-finals,

323
00:14:44,927 --> 00:14:47,103
where the contestants
will be given a surprise theme

324
00:14:47,147 --> 00:14:49,932
48 hours before the competition.

325
00:14:49,976 --> 00:14:54,154
And finally, three trees
will advance to the final round,

326
00:14:54,197 --> 00:14:56,939
held in our historic townhall

327
00:14:56,983 --> 00:14:58,854
with the same theme every year.

328
00:14:58,898 --> 00:15:01,161
The meaning of Christmas.

329
00:15:01,204 --> 00:15:03,641
And of course,
the winner's tree will be lit

330
00:15:03,685 --> 00:15:06,340
on Christmas Eve in Town Square.

331
00:15:06,383 --> 00:15:09,909
So, test those lights,
untangle that garland

332
00:15:09,952 --> 00:15:13,913
and get ready to get festive.

333
00:15:13,956 --> 00:15:16,654
Well, good luck.

334
00:15:16,698 --> 00:15:18,918
You too.

335
00:15:26,577 --> 00:15:28,623
All right contestants,
it's time.

336
00:15:28,666 --> 00:15:30,930
On your marks.

337
00:15:30,973 --> 00:15:33,933
Get set.

338
00:15:33,976 --> 00:15:35,804
Decorate.

339
00:16:40,564 --> 00:16:42,436
Time.

340
00:16:47,745 --> 00:16:49,790
So, we just need to
beat out eight other trees,

341
00:16:49,834 --> 00:16:51,053
plus David.

342
00:16:51,097 --> 00:16:52,402
Easier said than done.

343
00:16:52,446 --> 00:16:53,708
Come on, I already hear

344
00:16:53,751 --> 00:16:55,971
our tree's getting some good
buzz...

345
00:16:56,015 --> 00:16:58,017
You are incorrigible.

346
00:16:58,060 --> 00:17:01,368
- Look, Daddy.
- Look at that.

347
00:17:01,411 --> 00:17:04,458
Wow, it's bee-ginning
to look a lot like Christmas.

348
00:17:06,502 --> 00:17:09,419
Oh, so he can do it?

349
00:17:10,377 --> 00:17:12,857
Uh, we're calling it
the Flight of the Bumble Tree.

350
00:17:12,901 --> 00:17:15,685
- It's so pretty.
- Aw, thanks Gabby.

351
00:17:15,730 --> 00:17:17,906
And you did a very
beautiful job dressing Abigail,

352
00:17:17,949 --> 00:17:20,604
she looks like
she's ready for the parade.

353
00:17:23,346 --> 00:17:25,566
Come on Gabs,
we better get back.

354
00:17:26,958 --> 00:17:28,786
Angie.

355
00:17:28,830 --> 00:17:31,963
I hope we win,
but I hope you do too.

356
00:17:37,534 --> 00:17:39,275
Could she be any more adorable?

357
00:17:39,319 --> 00:17:41,625
Not without a warning label.

358
00:17:41,669 --> 00:17:43,540
Oh, incoming.

359
00:17:43,584 --> 00:17:45,673
Hello, Angie, Blair.

360
00:17:45,716 --> 00:17:47,153
Tell me about your tree.

361
00:17:47,196 --> 00:17:48,502
Oh, well, it was inspired by

362
00:17:48,545 --> 00:17:50,199
"Flight of the Bumble Bee".

363
00:17:50,243 --> 00:17:52,549
Bee-themed colors and a
thousand tiny musical notes,

364
00:17:52,593 --> 00:17:54,595
just like the song.

365
00:17:54,638 --> 00:17:56,466
Very clever.

366
00:17:56,510 --> 00:17:59,600
I hope we didn't bumble it.

367
00:17:59,643 --> 00:18:01,950
Well,
I just love the honeycombs,

368
00:18:01,993 --> 00:18:06,607
what a sweet touch.

369
00:18:06,650 --> 00:18:08,478
Thank you, ladies.

370
00:18:10,611 --> 00:18:12,743
David Mitchell.

371
00:18:12,787 --> 00:18:14,310
It's been a while.

372
00:18:14,354 --> 00:18:17,052
Too long.
You haven't changed a bit.

373
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:19,446
Ha, don't try to butter up
the judge, dear.

374
00:18:19,489 --> 00:18:22,231
Tell me about your tree.
Well, her name is Abigail

375
00:18:22,275 --> 00:18:25,321
and we got her
from our friend Angie.

376
00:18:25,365 --> 00:18:27,062
It's our
Red, White and Blue Spruce.

377
00:18:27,106 --> 00:18:28,933
My dad and I decorated it.

378
00:18:28,977 --> 00:18:30,389
Fourth of July
is her favorite holiday.

379
00:18:30,413 --> 00:18:31,632
After Christmas, of course.

380
00:18:31,675 --> 00:18:33,677
Of course.

381
00:18:33,721 --> 00:18:36,767
We wanted it to look like
an exploding firework.

382
00:18:36,811 --> 00:18:40,162
Well, I'm surprised
I don't hear a boom.

383
00:18:40,206 --> 00:18:42,860
Very nice tree
and very nicely done, Gabby.

384
00:18:42,904 --> 00:18:44,384
Thank you.

385
00:18:46,777 --> 00:18:49,563
Well folks, I have to say,

386
00:18:49,606 --> 00:18:52,740
the competition
has never been stronger.

387
00:18:52,783 --> 00:18:54,785
Let's give it up
for our contestants.

388
00:18:58,137 --> 00:19:00,182
Without further ado,

389
00:19:00,226 --> 00:19:03,751
our fourth runner-up
and first qualifier,

390
00:19:03,794 --> 00:19:08,190
a Candy Cane Christmas.

391
00:19:08,234 --> 00:19:12,542
Our third runner-up,
Christmas with the Nutcracker.

392
00:19:15,632 --> 00:19:17,808
Our second runner-up,

393
00:19:17,852 --> 00:19:20,724
the Twelve Days
of Christmas Tree.

394
00:19:22,596 --> 00:19:24,598
Our first runner-up,

395
00:19:24,641 --> 00:19:28,341
Flight of the Bumble Tree.

396
00:19:28,384 --> 00:19:32,388
And the winners of the
Greenpine Grove Town Square

397
00:19:32,432 --> 00:19:34,390
Christmas Eve Festival of Lights

398
00:19:34,434 --> 00:19:36,175
Christmas Tree
Decorating Contest

399
00:19:36,218 --> 00:19:38,133
quarterfinals is...

400
00:19:38,177 --> 00:19:40,091
I think it's
just getting longer.

401
00:19:40,135 --> 00:19:42,398
The Red, White and Blue Spruce.

402
00:19:45,401 --> 00:19:49,188
Congratulations and thank you
to everyone who participated.

403
00:19:49,231 --> 00:19:53,235
Semi-finalists,
we'll see you next week.

404
00:19:53,279 --> 00:19:55,063
- I'll be back.
- Okay.

405
00:19:56,804 --> 00:19:59,676
Congratulations, I guess I'll
see you back here in a few days.

406
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:01,852
I guess so.

407
00:20:01,896 --> 00:20:04,246
Nicely done.

408
00:20:04,290 --> 00:20:06,596
What a wonderful start
to the competition this year.

409
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:08,990
I can't wait to see what
you two come up with next week.

410
00:20:09,033 --> 00:20:10,818
I can't wait to hear the theme.

411
00:20:10,861 --> 00:20:12,254
You know the rules.

412
00:20:12,298 --> 00:20:14,343
Forty-eight hours
before the competition begins.

413
00:20:14,387 --> 00:20:17,216
No one gets a special advantage.

414
00:20:17,259 --> 00:20:21,176
But something tells me
you don't need one.

415
00:20:29,663 --> 00:20:31,142
What are you smiling at?

416
00:20:31,186 --> 00:20:33,797
I'm not smiling.

417
00:20:33,841 --> 00:20:35,582
Just help me take the tree down.

418
00:20:35,625 --> 00:20:37,212
I'm sure Dad's waiting for us
at the nursery.

419
00:20:37,236 --> 00:20:39,760
Yeah. Better not bee late.

420
00:20:39,803 --> 00:20:41,544
Okay.

421
00:20:47,028 --> 00:20:48,290
We won. We won.

422
00:20:48,334 --> 00:20:49,422
Wow.

423
00:20:49,465 --> 00:20:51,206
Congratulations.

424
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:52,879
Maybe you guys want to
tackle my house next?

425
00:20:52,903 --> 00:20:54,949
- Oh, I don't know about that.
- Why not?

426
00:20:54,992 --> 00:20:56,405
Well, it's a lot of work
putting everything up,

427
00:20:56,429 --> 00:20:57,560
bringing it back down.

428
00:20:57,604 --> 00:20:59,997
Besides, we're not here that
long.

429
00:21:01,172 --> 00:21:02,609
Hey, why don't you go see

430
00:21:02,652 --> 00:21:04,915
if we have enough wood
for the fire tomorrow night?

431
00:21:04,959 --> 00:21:06,395
I told you those decorations

432
00:21:06,439 --> 00:21:07,839
are in my basement
if you want them.

433
00:21:07,875 --> 00:21:09,069
Come on, Lil, when'd you take

434
00:21:09,093 --> 00:21:10,506
your Christmas lights down
last year?

435
00:21:10,530 --> 00:21:12,445
Um, just in time for Easter.

436
00:21:12,488 --> 00:21:14,466
You know how much I work.
I do know, that's why I

437
00:21:14,490 --> 00:21:15,946
don't wanna leave you
with a mess to clean up.

438
00:21:15,970 --> 00:21:17,363
Hmm.

439
00:21:17,406 --> 00:21:18,601
Hey, has Gabby
said anything to you

440
00:21:18,625 --> 00:21:20,279
about what she wants
for Christmas?

441
00:21:20,322 --> 00:21:22,411
She keeps saying
she can't decide.

442
00:21:22,455 --> 00:21:23,997
What kind of a kid doesn't
have a Christmas list

443
00:21:24,021 --> 00:21:25,719
a mile long?

444
00:21:25,762 --> 00:21:28,199
Yours.

445
00:21:36,469 --> 00:21:38,253
Angie, is
everything okay in here?

446
00:21:38,297 --> 00:21:41,691
Don't come in here.
I'm wrapping your gift.

447
00:21:41,735 --> 00:21:44,390
Okay.
I'm trying to wrap your gift.

448
00:21:46,870 --> 00:21:49,308
- Oh...
- Hmm.

449
00:21:49,351 --> 00:21:52,093
Oh.

450
00:21:52,136 --> 00:21:54,269
The new slippers I asked for.

451
00:21:54,313 --> 00:21:56,097
How do you do that?

452
00:21:56,140 --> 00:21:58,229
I was trying to disguise it.

453
00:21:58,273 --> 00:21:59,709
As what?

454
00:21:59,753 --> 00:22:02,103
Oh, it was uh, it was evolving.

455
00:22:02,146 --> 00:22:03,887
Hmm...

456
00:22:03,931 --> 00:22:09,589
Angie, your mother was the best
gift wrapper I ever met.

457
00:22:09,632 --> 00:22:12,026
Remember the year
I needed a new briefcase?

458
00:22:12,069 --> 00:22:16,117
And she wrapped it to look
like a bike?

459
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:18,249
She had a gift for making

460
00:22:18,293 --> 00:22:21,383
ordinary things beautiful.

461
00:22:21,427 --> 00:22:23,187
Ya know, I learned early on
I was never gonna be able

462
00:22:23,211 --> 00:22:24,995
to keep up with her
on that front.

463
00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:28,390
But I also learned
I didn't have to.

464
00:22:28,434 --> 00:22:32,916
I found my own way
of doing things for your mother.

465
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:37,312
My own way of showing her
how much I loved her.

466
00:22:37,356 --> 00:22:40,881
They didn't always
look the way hers did.

467
00:22:40,924 --> 00:22:43,884
But as your mom said,

468
00:22:43,927 --> 00:22:45,799
it's what's inside that counts.

469
00:22:48,149 --> 00:22:49,846
Don't worry.

470
00:22:49,890 --> 00:22:51,718
I'll act surprised.

471
00:23:00,248 --> 00:23:02,119
Okay, last one.

472
00:23:02,859 --> 00:23:04,818
Cool.

473
00:23:11,215 --> 00:23:13,217
You're quiet tonight.

474
00:23:13,261 --> 00:23:15,698
I'm just thinking.

475
00:23:15,742 --> 00:23:16,960
About what?

476
00:23:18,571 --> 00:23:20,442
Mom.

477
00:23:22,357 --> 00:23:25,273
Yeah,
I think about her a lot, too.

478
00:23:25,316 --> 00:23:26,927
Like what?

479
00:23:29,190 --> 00:23:32,759
Her smile, her laugh,

480
00:23:32,802 --> 00:23:35,370
how you look just like her.

481
00:23:35,414 --> 00:23:38,286
How she loved warm weather
and sunflowers.

482
00:23:38,329 --> 00:23:39,896
She did?

483
00:23:39,940 --> 00:23:41,594
She did.

484
00:23:41,637 --> 00:23:43,726
She used to grow them in the
garden in our backyard.

485
00:23:45,772 --> 00:23:47,251
Dad.

486
00:23:47,295 --> 00:23:49,993
Yeah, sweetie?

487
00:23:50,037 --> 00:23:52,518
I know what
I want for Christmas.

488
00:23:55,216 --> 00:23:56,478
Enjoy your tree.

489
00:23:56,522 --> 00:23:57,673
Don't forget
to water her every day.

490
00:23:57,697 --> 00:24:00,395
- Hi.
- Hi.

491
00:24:01,265 --> 00:24:03,311
Saying goodbye to another one?

492
00:24:03,354 --> 00:24:04,747
Ah, Francine.

493
00:24:04,791 --> 00:24:07,184
Planted her when I got a B+
on my math test.

494
00:24:07,228 --> 00:24:10,318
See, there really is no bad
reason to plant a tree.

495
00:24:10,361 --> 00:24:11,972
Oh, what brings you by?

496
00:24:12,015 --> 00:24:14,322
Abigail givin' you trouble?
Because I could talk to her.

497
00:24:14,365 --> 00:24:15,647
I was actually hoping
you could help me

498
00:24:15,671 --> 00:24:16,803
with something else.

499
00:24:16,846 --> 00:24:18,239
I wanted some flowers.

500
00:24:18,282 --> 00:24:20,284
Oh well, Blair's in the
nursery today.

501
00:24:20,328 --> 00:24:21,895
No, I'm not.

502
00:24:21,938 --> 00:24:24,071
Blair, what are you doing?

503
00:24:24,114 --> 00:24:25,551
Taking my turn out front.

504
00:24:25,594 --> 00:24:26,832
Angie can help you
with the flowers.

505
00:24:26,856 --> 00:24:28,510
Blair.

506
00:24:28,554 --> 00:24:29,966
Welcome to Waldron's.
Can I help you find something?

507
00:24:29,990 --> 00:24:32,601
- Wha...
- Nice to see you again.

508
00:24:32,645 --> 00:24:37,432
Uh, I guess I will show you
to the greenhouse.

509
00:24:37,476 --> 00:24:38,825
We have some gorgeous
poinsettias.

510
00:24:38,868 --> 00:24:40,783
Just got roses in.

511
00:24:40,827 --> 00:24:42,959
Actually, I have sort of
an unusual request.

512
00:24:43,003 --> 00:24:44,395
Oh?

513
00:24:44,439 --> 00:24:46,963
Sunflowers,
for Christmas morning.

514
00:24:47,007 --> 00:24:49,662
Ooh, that might be kinda tricky.

515
00:24:49,705 --> 00:24:51,011
They're not really in season

516
00:24:51,054 --> 00:24:52,641
and we only have a few days
before Christmas.

517
00:24:52,665 --> 00:24:54,144
I know.

518
00:24:54,188 --> 00:24:56,059
I guess I thought if anyone
could pull it off.

519
00:24:56,103 --> 00:24:57,974
Well, I will try,
but I might have more luck

520
00:24:58,018 --> 00:25:00,020
if you expand
your flower options.

521
00:25:00,063 --> 00:25:01,978
I wish I could.

522
00:25:02,022 --> 00:25:03,589
They're for Gabby.

523
00:25:03,632 --> 00:25:06,069
See, her mother loved
sunflowers.

524
00:25:06,113 --> 00:25:07,375
She just told me the only thing

525
00:25:07,418 --> 00:25:08,942
she really wants for Christmas

526
00:25:08,985 --> 00:25:11,118
is a bouquet of them
to honor her mom.

527
00:25:11,161 --> 00:25:12,554
Okay, that's uh...

528
00:25:12,598 --> 00:25:14,295
A little bit of pressure.

529
00:25:14,338 --> 00:25:17,472
Yeah. I ordered some
plastic flowers, but...

530
00:25:17,516 --> 00:25:21,563
But there is nothing
quite like the real thing.

531
00:25:21,607 --> 00:25:24,435
Well, I will definitely try.

532
00:25:24,479 --> 00:25:25,436
Thanks, Angie.

533
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:27,221
Ooh, don't thank me yet.

534
00:25:27,264 --> 00:25:29,702
I mean, to get sunflowers here
before Christmas morning?

535
00:25:29,745 --> 00:25:33,575
I know, but hey, it's the
season of miracles and hope.

536
00:25:33,619 --> 00:25:36,752
So, I'm hoping for a miracle.

537
00:25:40,974 --> 00:25:42,584
It's from Betty.

538
00:25:42,628 --> 00:25:45,065
Oh, the theme for round two.

539
00:25:45,108 --> 00:25:47,589
Angels and evergreen.

540
00:25:47,633 --> 00:25:50,418
Hmm, game on.

541
00:25:50,461 --> 00:25:52,333
See you there.

542
00:25:54,901 --> 00:25:56,511
I thought he wanted flowers.

543
00:25:56,555 --> 00:25:58,557
Oh, he does. Sunflowers.

544
00:25:58,600 --> 00:25:59,949
This time of year?

545
00:25:59,993 --> 00:26:02,735
Yeah, I told him we'd try.

546
00:26:02,778 --> 00:26:04,084
Did you get Betty's text?

547
00:26:04,127 --> 00:26:05,607
Angels and evergreen.

548
00:26:05,651 --> 00:26:07,087
Do you have any ideas?

549
00:26:07,130 --> 00:26:09,437
Mm-mm, do you?

550
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:11,526
No, I think I peaked
with the bumble tree.

551
00:26:11,570 --> 00:26:12,614
Okay.

552
00:26:12,658 --> 00:26:14,921
Well, first things first.

553
00:26:14,964 --> 00:26:16,183
Who are you calling?

554
00:26:16,226 --> 00:26:18,402
Everyone I can think of.

555
00:26:18,446 --> 00:26:19,752
Hey, this is Angie

556
00:26:19,795 --> 00:26:21,536
from Waldron's Nursery
in Greenpine Grove.

557
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:24,844
I'm trying to track down
some sunflowers.

558
00:26:24,887 --> 00:26:26,367
Yeah, sunflowers...

559
00:26:33,374 --> 00:26:36,638
How adorable are these guys?

560
00:26:36,682 --> 00:26:40,120
I might be biased,
but I think very.

561
00:26:41,164 --> 00:26:43,340
I thought I'd send some
with you to the contest.

562
00:26:43,384 --> 00:26:45,168
Aw, thanks, Dad.

563
00:26:46,648 --> 00:26:48,302
So, are you ready?

564
00:26:48,345 --> 00:26:51,610
No. No, we have our theme,
which is angels and evergreen.

565
00:26:51,653 --> 00:26:54,395
But I have no idea
what to do with it yet.

566
00:26:54,438 --> 00:26:55,938
I'm sure you'll figure
something out, sweetie.

567
00:26:55,962 --> 00:26:57,703
You always do.

568
00:26:57,746 --> 00:26:59,008
I'm done.

569
00:26:59,052 --> 00:27:02,098
Ohp, don't want him
to get lonely.

570
00:27:25,295 --> 00:27:26,819
Do we have enough decorations?

571
00:27:26,862 --> 00:27:29,256
I don't know, did our tree
triple in size overnight?

572
00:27:29,299 --> 00:27:30,823
I just want to be prepared.

573
00:27:30,866 --> 00:27:32,694
We're prepared
to decorate a redwood.

574
00:27:32,738 --> 00:27:34,740
- And we have the photos?
- Right here.

575
00:27:34,783 --> 00:27:36,829
We're all set.
You can relax.

576
00:27:36,872 --> 00:27:38,787
Okay.

577
00:27:40,659 --> 00:27:43,096
Where are David and Gabby?

578
00:27:43,139 --> 00:27:44,401
Um, I don't know.

579
00:27:44,445 --> 00:27:46,752
Maybe they're running late.

580
00:27:54,020 --> 00:27:55,021
Hello.

581
00:27:55,064 --> 00:27:57,284
- David.
- Angie?

582
00:27:57,327 --> 00:27:59,416
Where are you?
The contest is about to start.

583
00:27:59,460 --> 00:28:00,896
Oh, uh yeah.

584
00:28:00,940 --> 00:28:05,335
We should be there
right after it ends.

585
00:28:05,379 --> 00:28:06,728
What?

586
00:28:06,772 --> 00:28:09,209
- We got a flat.
- Where are you?

587
00:28:09,252 --> 00:28:11,211
Uh, Lily's house. Why?

588
00:28:11,254 --> 00:28:13,692
Uh, stay there.

589
00:28:15,606 --> 00:28:19,045
David and Gabby got a flat,
so I'm gonna go get them.

590
00:28:19,088 --> 00:28:21,569
Uh, you can't leave now.
It's starting.

591
00:28:21,612 --> 00:28:23,832
Just put the lights on
and I'll be back, okay?

592
00:28:23,876 --> 00:28:26,157
Angie, if we don't make it
through this round it's over.

593
00:28:26,182 --> 00:28:27,401
You can get started.

594
00:28:27,444 --> 00:28:29,142
I will be right back to help.
Okay?

595
00:28:29,185 --> 00:28:30,883
But, uh.

596
00:28:31,579 --> 00:28:33,146
Contestants ready.

597
00:28:35,931 --> 00:28:38,107
Oh, my Lord. Okay.

598
00:28:38,151 --> 00:28:39,979
That's a lot of lights.

599
00:28:40,022 --> 00:28:42,068
I didn't know there'd be
this many lights, okay...

600
00:28:42,111 --> 00:28:43,765
I'm sorry, sweetie.

601
00:28:43,809 --> 00:28:46,768
Maybe when Lily gets home, she
can take us in time to see...

602
00:28:46,812 --> 00:28:49,075
Angie?
What are you doing here?

603
00:28:49,118 --> 00:28:50,903
What does it look like?
I'm saving the day.

604
00:28:50,946 --> 00:28:52,948
- But the competition.
- Has already started.

605
00:28:52,992 --> 00:28:54,926
So, let's all stop talking.
We'll start loading boxes

606
00:28:54,950 --> 00:28:56,735
and we'll be there
before we know it, okay?

607
00:28:56,778 --> 00:28:58,432
Here you go, sweetie.

608
00:28:59,825 --> 00:29:02,088
All right. I've got these.

609
00:29:04,830 --> 00:29:06,788
I'll get the door, come on.

610
00:29:09,965 --> 00:29:11,358
Thank you, Angie.

611
00:29:11,401 --> 00:29:13,490
You're welcome.
Let's get these trees decorated.

612
00:29:13,534 --> 00:29:15,144
Good luck.

613
00:29:16,624 --> 00:29:17,799
I'm back.

614
00:29:17,843 --> 00:29:19,409
Welcome back.

615
00:29:19,453 --> 00:29:22,804
So just a question
that's been on my mind.

616
00:29:22,848 --> 00:29:23,805
What were you thinking?

617
00:29:23,849 --> 00:29:25,546
I couldn't just leave them.

618
00:29:25,589 --> 00:29:27,940
I thought you wanted to win
for your mom.

619
00:29:27,983 --> 00:29:29,376
I do. I just...

620
00:29:31,682 --> 00:29:34,163
I don't want them to lose.

621
00:29:35,382 --> 00:29:37,688
Hand me those white lights,
Gabs.

622
00:29:39,647 --> 00:29:42,041
I'm glad Angie's our friend,
Dad.

623
00:29:42,084 --> 00:29:44,478
Me, too, Gabs. Me, too.

624
00:30:01,321 --> 00:30:02,888
Thank you.

625
00:30:33,222 --> 00:30:35,050
Time.

626
00:30:52,938 --> 00:30:55,288
Our angels look really pretty.

627
00:30:55,331 --> 00:30:57,638
Oh, what beautiful angels.

628
00:30:57,681 --> 00:31:01,033
Look at all these angels
and evergreen.

629
00:31:01,076 --> 00:31:02,904
Tell me about your tree.

630
00:31:02,948 --> 00:31:05,037
We have 100 angels in our tree.

631
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:07,648
My dad and my Aunt Lily
helped me make them.

632
00:31:07,691 --> 00:31:10,825
Oh, and we have one on top,
but we didn't make that one.

633
00:31:10,869 --> 00:31:13,697
Well, I'm very impressed.

634
00:31:13,741 --> 00:31:16,918
I noticed you had a little bit
of a late start today.

635
00:31:16,962 --> 00:31:18,659
Yeah, we had some car trouble.

636
00:31:18,702 --> 00:31:21,029
My dad got a flat tire, but
our friend Angie picked us up,

637
00:31:21,053 --> 00:31:23,359
so we could still
decorate our tree.

638
00:31:26,101 --> 00:31:29,191
Well, Angie sounds like
a very good friend.

639
00:31:29,235 --> 00:31:32,064
I better go see what her tree
looks like up close.

640
00:31:34,501 --> 00:31:37,939
Angie, Blair,
tell me about your tree.

641
00:31:37,983 --> 00:31:40,550
Well, our angels are
the people of our town.

642
00:31:40,594 --> 00:31:41,769
Oh.

643
00:31:41,812 --> 00:31:43,336
Yeah, we have Mr. Byrd,

644
00:31:43,379 --> 00:31:45,773
who's run the library
for over 50 years.

645
00:31:45,816 --> 00:31:48,732
And Dr. Wolf,
who gives free piano lessons

646
00:31:48,776 --> 00:31:50,821
to anyone who can't afford them.

647
00:31:50,865 --> 00:31:54,260
And my mom who made sure anyone
who came into the nursery

648
00:31:54,303 --> 00:31:56,044
left with a smile on their face,

649
00:31:56,088 --> 00:31:59,439
so our angels are
the people of Greenpine Grove.

650
00:31:59,482 --> 00:32:01,920
That's lovely, Angie.

651
00:32:01,963 --> 00:32:05,010
I, uh, understand you had a
little delay as well.

652
00:32:05,053 --> 00:32:07,012
And you lost your angel on top.

653
00:32:07,055 --> 00:32:08,448
Oh, it's nothing.

654
00:32:08,491 --> 00:32:10,319
Just helping a friend.

655
00:32:10,363 --> 00:32:13,453
Well, it's a big risk
to take for a friend.

656
00:32:16,282 --> 00:32:18,110
Well, some friends are worth it.

657
00:32:21,026 --> 00:32:23,289
I would like to thank
all of our semi-finalists

658
00:32:23,332 --> 00:32:25,639
for their beautiful decorating.

659
00:32:25,682 --> 00:32:28,729
What a wonderful way to show our
community's Christmas spirit.

660
00:32:35,431 --> 00:32:38,913
Our first qualifier,
in third place,

661
00:32:38,957 --> 00:32:42,221
Angie Waldron and Blair Baulin.

662
00:32:46,312 --> 00:32:50,229
In second place,
our second qualifiers,

663
00:32:50,272 --> 00:32:52,709
David and Gabby Mitchell.

664
00:32:57,149 --> 00:33:01,849
And in first place,
our final qualifiers,

665
00:33:01,892 --> 00:33:05,635
Tanya Motley and Collin Fleming.

666
00:33:08,203 --> 00:33:10,510
We'll see you at the finals.

667
00:33:10,553 --> 00:33:13,687
And don't forget our gala
to celebrate our finalists

668
00:33:13,730 --> 00:33:16,820
this weekend
right here at the Pavilion.

669
00:33:23,653 --> 00:33:25,525
- Want to go say hi?
- Yeah.

670
00:33:25,568 --> 00:33:28,397
For a second.

671
00:33:28,441 --> 00:33:30,138
Congratulations.

672
00:33:30,182 --> 00:33:32,097
I feel like
we cost you the ribbon.

673
00:33:32,140 --> 00:33:33,968
You didn't knock our angel off.

674
00:33:34,012 --> 00:33:36,971
No, but if it wasn't for us,
then you'd had time to fix it,

675
00:33:37,015 --> 00:33:39,234
so I definitely owe you one.

676
00:33:39,278 --> 00:33:41,802
You definitely do.

677
00:33:43,064 --> 00:33:45,588
Do you want to come for dinner?

678
00:33:45,632 --> 00:33:48,243
I'm sure Angie already has
plans for dinner, Gabs.

679
00:33:48,287 --> 00:33:51,464
No, she doesn't.

680
00:33:52,726 --> 00:33:55,076
How is five o'clock?

681
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:57,731
I will bring dessert.

682
00:33:57,774 --> 00:33:59,472
See you then.

683
00:34:03,563 --> 00:34:05,173
Oh. Hmm.

684
00:34:07,088 --> 00:34:08,610
Oh.

685
00:34:08,655 --> 00:34:09,719
What are you doing in there?

686
00:34:09,743 --> 00:34:11,136
Trying to find
something to wear.

687
00:34:11,179 --> 00:34:12,374
Well, don't you think
this is just

688
00:34:12,398 --> 00:34:15,139
a little over the top
for a date?

689
00:34:15,183 --> 00:34:17,620
It's not a date.
It's just dinner.

690
00:34:17,664 --> 00:34:19,579
I can't find my red sweater.

691
00:34:19,621 --> 00:34:22,321
That cashmere cableknit?

692
00:34:23,235 --> 00:34:24,322
Just a guess.

693
00:34:24,366 --> 00:34:26,542
You let me borrow that,
remember?

694
00:34:26,585 --> 00:34:27,804
I had that interview.

695
00:34:27,848 --> 00:34:29,023
That was last Christmas.

696
00:34:29,067 --> 00:34:32,809
And you're just now missing it.

697
00:34:32,853 --> 00:34:34,724
Right, my fault.
I'll bring it back.

698
00:34:34,768 --> 00:34:36,006
Okay, that doesn't
help me tonight.

699
00:34:36,030 --> 00:34:37,466
What am I supposed to wear?

700
00:34:37,510 --> 00:34:38,728
What about what you have on?

701
00:34:38,772 --> 00:34:40,121
I can't wear what I have on.

702
00:34:40,165 --> 00:34:41,905
I wore this to tree decorating.

703
00:34:41,949 --> 00:34:43,123
And?

704
00:34:43,168 --> 00:34:45,474
And, uh, I need something else.

705
00:34:45,518 --> 00:34:46,649
For a date.

706
00:34:46,693 --> 00:34:48,260
It's dinner.

707
00:34:48,303 --> 00:34:49,802
Well, you're putting a lot of
thought into this outfit

708
00:34:49,826 --> 00:34:52,132
for just dinner.

709
00:34:52,177 --> 00:34:53,632
Okay, well, you don't
get to have an opinion

710
00:34:53,656 --> 00:34:54,788
after you stole...

711
00:34:54,831 --> 00:34:57,269
Uh, nah, uh, borrowed.

712
00:34:57,312 --> 00:34:59,184
My favorite sweater.

713
00:35:01,316 --> 00:35:02,796
What do we think?

714
00:35:02,839 --> 00:35:04,493
Too fancy?

715
00:35:04,537 --> 00:35:07,975
No. It's perfect.

716
00:35:08,018 --> 00:35:09,933
For a date.

717
00:35:09,977 --> 00:35:11,152
It's not a date.

718
00:35:11,196 --> 00:35:13,154
Okay, if you say so.

719
00:35:13,198 --> 00:35:16,549
Just seems like
you're cleaning my house a lot.

720
00:35:19,073 --> 00:35:21,162
As for example.

721
00:35:21,206 --> 00:35:22,792
I just wanna make sure
everything's tidy.

722
00:35:22,816 --> 00:35:24,600
It's called being hospitable.

723
00:35:24,644 --> 00:35:27,168
Oh, so now your big sister
is dirty and inhospitable?

724
00:35:27,212 --> 00:35:28,735
No, just...

725
00:35:28,778 --> 00:35:32,086
Okay, David put down
the dustpan, okay?

726
00:35:33,740 --> 00:35:35,829
Come on over here.

727
00:35:35,872 --> 00:35:37,570
Take a deep breath.

728
00:35:37,613 --> 00:35:39,006
The house is clean.

729
00:35:39,049 --> 00:35:40,355
Dinner's in the oven.

730
00:35:40,399 --> 00:35:42,575
Why don't you just relax?

731
00:35:42,618 --> 00:35:45,752
Oh, perfect.
Help me get under the couch.

732
00:35:52,193 --> 00:35:55,370
Well, look at you.
Where you off to?

733
00:35:55,414 --> 00:35:57,459
Just uh, dinner.

734
00:35:57,503 --> 00:35:58,591
With David Mitchell.

735
00:35:58,634 --> 00:35:59,505
A date.

736
00:35:59,548 --> 00:36:01,811
No, no, no, no.

737
00:36:01,855 --> 00:36:04,858
Here, take the
Ginger Gate Bridge

738
00:36:04,901 --> 00:36:06,773
with you for dessert.

739
00:36:06,816 --> 00:36:08,992
Aw, it's almost
too pretty to eat.

740
00:36:09,036 --> 00:36:12,779
- Oh, okay.
- Ah, ah. I said almost.

741
00:36:14,302 --> 00:36:16,826
Blair, do you want to stay and
help me get started on the uh,

742
00:36:16,870 --> 00:36:18,828
Leaning Tower of Ginger?

743
00:36:18,872 --> 00:36:21,266
Can I eat
all the leftover gingerbread?

744
00:36:21,309 --> 00:36:22,745
You drive a hard bargain.

745
00:36:22,789 --> 00:36:25,008
I know what I'm worth.

746
00:36:25,052 --> 00:36:26,836
I should head out.

747
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:28,490
Okay, bye sweetheart.
Drive safe.

748
00:36:28,534 --> 00:36:30,100
Bye.

749
00:36:30,884 --> 00:36:32,407
Enjoy your date.

750
00:36:32,451 --> 00:36:34,104
It's not a date.

751
00:36:36,281 --> 00:36:37,238
Want marshmallows
or gummy bears?

752
00:36:37,282 --> 00:36:38,433
Oh, definitely marshmallows.

753
00:36:38,457 --> 00:36:40,198
Oh, yeah.

754
00:36:42,417 --> 00:36:43,462
Lily.

755
00:36:43,505 --> 00:36:46,204
Angie, come in. Hi.

756
00:36:46,247 --> 00:36:48,467
I hope everyone
likes gingerbread.

757
00:36:48,510 --> 00:36:50,077
Who doesn't like gingerbread?

758
00:36:50,120 --> 00:36:52,514
Wow, can we eat it?

759
00:36:52,558 --> 00:36:54,124
After dinner.

760
00:36:54,168 --> 00:36:55,996
Can I take your coat?
Sure.

761
00:36:56,039 --> 00:36:58,303
I don't think it'll fit you.

762
00:36:58,346 --> 00:37:01,001
Thank you.
I got you.

763
00:37:01,044 --> 00:37:02,916
So how have you been, Lily?

764
00:37:02,959 --> 00:37:05,223
Busy, I'm covering some
extra shifts at the hospital,

765
00:37:05,266 --> 00:37:07,964
so some of the other nurses can
travel for the holidays.

766
00:37:08,008 --> 00:37:09,444
Aunt Lily works in the nursery.

767
00:37:09,488 --> 00:37:11,141
So do I.

768
00:37:11,185 --> 00:37:14,884
My babies need to be changed
less often, but...

769
00:37:14,928 --> 00:37:17,713
I'm so glad you two reconnected.

770
00:37:17,757 --> 00:37:20,499
My house has never been cleaner.

771
00:37:20,542 --> 00:37:22,979
Lily, shouldn't you be
getting to work?

772
00:37:23,023 --> 00:37:26,418
I've got a few minutes.

773
00:37:26,461 --> 00:37:28,768
Well, dinner should be ready
in a bit.

774
00:37:28,811 --> 00:37:31,292
- Can I help you with anything?
- No, no, I think I got it.

775
00:37:31,336 --> 00:37:34,643
- Come on, I'll give you a tour.
- Okay.

776
00:37:34,687 --> 00:37:37,559
Be sure to look under the couch.

777
00:37:39,518 --> 00:37:42,825
And this is my room.

778
00:37:42,869 --> 00:37:44,914
This is Aunt Lily's goldfish,
Bruno.

779
00:37:44,958 --> 00:37:46,762
She's letting me take care
of him while we stay here.

780
00:37:46,786 --> 00:37:48,483
Oh, nice to meet you, Bruno.

781
00:37:48,527 --> 00:37:51,660
How do you do?

782
00:37:52,574 --> 00:37:54,272
Oh, is this your mom?

783
00:37:55,838 --> 00:37:58,667
She's really beautiful.

784
00:38:06,675 --> 00:38:11,245
You know, it was just about
a year ago when I lost my mom.

785
00:38:11,289 --> 00:38:13,247
Does it make you sad?

786
00:38:13,291 --> 00:38:14,944
Every day.

787
00:38:14,988 --> 00:38:16,990
I miss her so much.

788
00:38:17,033 --> 00:38:18,948
I miss my mom, too.

789
00:38:21,386 --> 00:38:23,126
But you know,
if my mom were here,

790
00:38:23,170 --> 00:38:25,912
I know she wouldn't
want me to be too sad.

791
00:38:25,955 --> 00:38:29,002
So I try to find
reasons to be happy.

792
00:38:29,045 --> 00:38:33,789
Like finding good homes for my
Christmas trees like Abigail.

793
00:38:33,833 --> 00:38:37,924
Hot cocoa by the fireplace
with my dad.

794
00:38:37,967 --> 00:38:41,449
Making new friends like you.

795
00:38:42,668 --> 00:38:44,670
I'm so sorry you lost your mom,
Gabby.

796
00:38:45,932 --> 00:38:47,803
But it really does help

797
00:38:47,847 --> 00:38:49,805
to have a friend
who knows what it feels like.

798
00:38:49,849 --> 00:38:52,330
So thank you for being
that friend for me.

799
00:38:55,985 --> 00:39:00,033
Dinner's ready.

800
00:39:00,076 --> 00:39:02,252
Okay. Ready?

801
00:39:08,346 --> 00:39:11,697
Uh, that was delicious.

802
00:39:11,740 --> 00:39:13,414
Thanks, Gabby and I
like cooking together.

803
00:39:13,438 --> 00:39:14,830
Don't we, Gabs?

804
00:39:14,874 --> 00:39:16,919
I like helping my dad
in the kitchen, too.

805
00:39:16,963 --> 00:39:18,763
You know he spends
the entire Christmas season

806
00:39:18,791 --> 00:39:21,620
making his
gingerbread masterpieces?

807
00:39:21,663 --> 00:39:23,361
Last year he built
the Statue of Gingerty

808
00:39:23,404 --> 00:39:24,492
about this high.

809
00:39:24,536 --> 00:39:27,626
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

810
00:39:27,669 --> 00:39:28,888
There's nothing quite like

811
00:39:28,931 --> 00:39:31,673
hot cocoa and gingerbread
on a snowy night.

812
00:39:31,717 --> 00:39:33,719
Brr.

813
00:39:33,762 --> 00:39:34,894
What?

814
00:39:34,937 --> 00:39:37,331
You used to like the snow.

815
00:39:37,375 --> 00:39:39,091
I guess I've been in Florida
a little too long.

816
00:39:39,115 --> 00:39:40,465
Got used to the sunshine.

817
00:39:40,508 --> 00:39:42,336
Well, Florida sounds beautiful,

818
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:44,469
but there's nothing quite like
a white Christmas.

819
00:39:44,512 --> 00:39:47,297
Sledding and ice skating,
snowmen.

820
00:39:47,341 --> 00:39:48,734
I never built a snowman.

821
00:39:48,777 --> 00:39:49,691
Really?

822
00:39:49,735 --> 00:39:50,866
How old are you?

823
00:39:50,910 --> 00:39:52,868
Ten.

824
00:39:52,912 --> 00:39:54,324
Okay, you're telling me
you have gone

825
00:39:54,348 --> 00:39:56,394
10 years of your life
without building a snowman?

826
00:39:58,613 --> 00:40:02,182
Well, I say gear up
because we're doin' it.

827
00:40:04,010 --> 00:40:05,228
You heard her, Gabs.

828
00:40:05,272 --> 00:40:07,230
Gear up.

829
00:40:12,497 --> 00:40:14,586
Whoo, okay.

830
00:40:14,629 --> 00:40:18,416
We just need a corn cob pipe,
coal and magic hat.

831
00:40:18,459 --> 00:40:20,722
We don't have
any of those things.

832
00:40:20,766 --> 00:40:23,464
What kind of household
are you runnin' here?

833
00:40:23,508 --> 00:40:24,900
Okay, that's fine.

834
00:40:24,944 --> 00:40:27,468
We will use my mom's
secret snowman recipe.

835
00:40:27,512 --> 00:40:28,556
Snowman recipe?

836
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:29,905
Mm-hmm.

837
00:40:29,949 --> 00:40:32,038
We will need raisins
for the eyes,

838
00:40:32,081 --> 00:40:33,648
a candy cane for the mouth,

839
00:40:33,692 --> 00:40:34,823
and a carrot for the nose.

840
00:40:34,867 --> 00:40:36,695
I'll be right back.

841
00:40:41,351 --> 00:40:43,155
I haven't seen her this
excited in a long time.

842
00:40:43,179 --> 00:40:45,268
Well, snowmen have
that effect on people.

843
00:40:45,312 --> 00:40:47,053
You're pretty good with kids,
huh?

844
00:40:47,096 --> 00:40:48,509
Well, I don't know
if I'm good with them,

845
00:40:48,533 --> 00:40:50,491
but I really like them.

846
00:40:50,535 --> 00:40:53,842
There's just something
so genuine about kids.

847
00:40:53,886 --> 00:40:57,498
Remind me to not
take things so seriously.

848
00:40:57,542 --> 00:40:59,413
You're building a snowman
on a weeknight.

849
00:40:59,457 --> 00:41:01,154
How serious can you
be taking things?

850
00:41:01,197 --> 00:41:03,417
Okay, some things
need to be taken seriously

851
00:41:03,461 --> 00:41:05,637
like snowmen
and Christmas trees.

852
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:07,421
Sunflowers.

853
00:41:07,465 --> 00:41:09,075
Ah.

854
00:41:09,118 --> 00:41:11,469
Sorry, I had to ask.

855
00:41:11,512 --> 00:41:14,123
I have called everyone
I can think of.

856
00:41:14,167 --> 00:41:15,516
I know.

857
00:41:15,560 --> 00:41:18,911
- Okay.
- You're back.

858
00:41:18,954 --> 00:41:21,870
We didn't have
any raisins or candy canes.

859
00:41:21,914 --> 00:41:23,568
And we ate all the carrots.

860
00:41:23,611 --> 00:41:26,788
So I have some olives,
pickles and ketchup.

861
00:41:28,790 --> 00:41:30,836
All right. That's perfect.

862
00:41:30,879 --> 00:41:34,622
That is the perfect first-time
snowman building recipe.

863
00:41:34,666 --> 00:41:36,406
Let's do this.

864
00:41:36,450 --> 00:41:38,104
- Come on, Gabs.
- Here's the pickle.

865
00:41:38,147 --> 00:41:39,366
Eyes.

866
00:41:39,409 --> 00:41:41,324
He looks funny.

867
00:41:43,413 --> 00:41:45,154
All right.

868
00:41:45,198 --> 00:41:46,416
Okay.

869
00:41:46,460 --> 00:41:48,201
A scarf.

870
00:41:49,637 --> 00:41:51,552
Yeah.

871
00:41:51,596 --> 00:41:55,991
Whew. Gabby, you are a natural
at building snowmen.

872
00:41:56,818 --> 00:41:58,298
Daddy, can we take a picture?

873
00:41:58,341 --> 00:42:00,648
Of course.
Okay, guys.

874
00:42:00,692 --> 00:42:02,041
Oh.

875
00:42:02,084 --> 00:42:03,216
Everybody say pickle.

876
00:42:03,259 --> 00:42:04,347
Pickle.

877
00:42:17,056 --> 00:42:18,666
Come here, Gabs.

878
00:42:20,363 --> 00:42:21,602
Hey, why don't you
go brush your teeth?

879
00:42:21,626 --> 00:42:22,540
Dad.

880
00:42:22,583 --> 00:42:23,715
Gabby.

881
00:42:23,758 --> 00:42:26,152
Okay.

882
00:42:27,806 --> 00:42:30,504
She is such a sweetheart.

883
00:42:30,548 --> 00:42:32,985
Yeah, she's a good kid.

884
00:42:33,638 --> 00:42:35,727
The last couple of years have
been tough on her.

885
00:42:35,770 --> 00:42:37,729
Losing her mom.

886
00:42:37,772 --> 00:42:40,732
So I decided to come back home
for a while.

887
00:42:40,775 --> 00:42:43,778
I thought it'd be nice for her
to be around family.

888
00:42:43,822 --> 00:42:46,999
It's a lot
for a little kid to handle.

889
00:42:47,042 --> 00:42:48,914
It's a lot for anyone to handle.

890
00:42:52,047 --> 00:42:55,573
Yeah, losing Gabrielle...

891
00:42:56,748 --> 00:42:59,054
Felt like losing
a part of myself.

892
00:43:01,927 --> 00:43:05,278
I keep telling Gabby
we're gonna be all right, but...

893
00:43:08,237 --> 00:43:10,065
But?

894
00:43:10,718 --> 00:43:12,894
What if I'm doing it wrong?

895
00:43:12,938 --> 00:43:16,463
What if I don't know how to
do this without Gabrielle?

896
00:43:16,506 --> 00:43:19,422
From where I sit,
Gabby's a pretty amazing kid.

897
00:43:21,686 --> 00:43:24,210
And you're a pretty amazing dad.

898
00:43:29,389 --> 00:43:33,915
I've been so worried about her
since her mom passed,

899
00:43:33,959 --> 00:43:37,658
but it was good to see her
laughing tonight.

900
00:43:37,702 --> 00:43:40,313
Just being a kid.

901
00:43:42,228 --> 00:43:43,751
I brushed my teeth.

902
00:43:43,795 --> 00:43:45,797
Let me see.

903
00:43:45,840 --> 00:43:47,276
Oh, I'm blinded.

904
00:43:47,320 --> 00:43:49,365
What are you?
A professional tooth brusher?

905
00:43:49,409 --> 00:43:50,715
Say good night, sweetheart.

906
00:43:50,758 --> 00:43:52,499
Good night, Angie.

907
00:43:52,542 --> 00:43:54,066
Good night.

908
00:43:54,109 --> 00:43:55,807
- I'll come tuck you in.
- Okay.

909
00:43:57,635 --> 00:44:00,681
Angie, will you be back?

910
00:44:00,725 --> 00:44:03,641
Oh, I...

911
00:44:05,555 --> 00:44:08,080
Well, will you?

912
00:44:10,648 --> 00:44:12,475
Soon.

913
00:44:20,266 --> 00:44:21,963
Good night.

914
00:44:27,926 --> 00:44:30,450
Gabby, have you asked Santa
for anything for Christmas?

915
00:44:30,493 --> 00:44:33,235
No, I just want sunflowers.

916
00:44:33,279 --> 00:44:34,996
Well, maybe you should think
of something else you'd like

917
00:44:35,020 --> 00:44:36,151
just in case.

918
00:44:36,195 --> 00:44:38,545
But I don't want anything else.

919
00:44:38,588 --> 00:44:39,764
Gabs.

920
00:44:39,807 --> 00:44:42,462
When can Angie come over again?

921
00:44:42,505 --> 00:44:43,550
I don't know, sweetie.

922
00:44:43,593 --> 00:44:45,378
We'll have to ask her.

923
00:44:45,421 --> 00:44:47,269
She's got her store
and her own dad to take care of.

924
00:44:47,293 --> 00:44:49,730
He can come, too.

925
00:44:49,774 --> 00:44:51,340
You really like
bein' around her, huh?

926
00:44:51,384 --> 00:44:53,821
Yeah, but...

927
00:44:53,865 --> 00:44:55,431
What?

928
00:44:55,475 --> 00:44:58,565
I like being around you
when you're around her, too.

929
00:44:58,608 --> 00:45:00,741
Good night, Daddy.

930
00:45:00,785 --> 00:45:03,091
Good night, Gabs.

931
00:45:03,135 --> 00:45:05,267
I love you.

932
00:45:11,752 --> 00:45:13,101
Hey, you don't have to do that.

933
00:45:13,145 --> 00:45:14,755
I don't mind.

934
00:45:14,799 --> 00:45:16,191
Here, let me.

935
00:45:16,235 --> 00:45:17,235
Really, I...

936
00:45:19,717 --> 00:45:21,327
got it.

937
00:45:24,112 --> 00:45:29,422
Uh, so where are all your
Christmas decorations?

938
00:45:29,465 --> 00:45:32,555
I just noticed.

939
00:45:32,599 --> 00:45:34,819
Well, the truth is
Gabrielle was always

940
00:45:34,862 --> 00:45:37,343
the decorator in our house.

941
00:45:37,386 --> 00:45:42,087
Christmas, Easter, Halloween,
President's Day.

942
00:45:42,130 --> 00:45:44,306
She just loved to celebrate.

943
00:45:44,350 --> 00:45:46,961
No matter the occasion.

944
00:45:47,005 --> 00:45:51,139
Since she's been gone,
I-I don't know.

945
00:45:51,183 --> 00:45:54,621
I guess I just haven't
felt much like celebrating.

946
00:45:54,664 --> 00:45:58,277
Hmm, what does Gabby think?

947
00:45:58,320 --> 00:46:00,801
I think Gabby's a little too
young to remember decorating.

948
00:46:00,845 --> 00:46:03,978
Besides, we're leaving
in a couple of weeks, so...

949
00:46:04,022 --> 00:46:08,287
Right. Back to Florida.

950
00:46:08,853 --> 00:46:10,245
Look, it's just...

951
00:46:10,289 --> 00:46:11,986
Hmm.

952
00:46:12,030 --> 00:46:15,250
I know your life with Gabby is
different than it used to be,

953
00:46:15,294 --> 00:46:18,123
but I still think
it's worth celebrating.

954
00:46:22,910 --> 00:46:25,280
Lily must have inherited our
parent's Christmas decorations

955
00:46:25,304 --> 00:46:28,698
when they moved.
This stuff is great.

956
00:46:28,742 --> 00:46:30,788
Well, most of it.

957
00:46:30,831 --> 00:46:32,572
Oh.

958
00:46:35,488 --> 00:46:38,056
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
What are you doing?

959
00:46:38,099 --> 00:46:40,406
I'm setting up
Christmas Village.

960
00:46:40,449 --> 00:46:42,930
Okay, the ice rink
goes in the center.

961
00:46:42,974 --> 00:46:44,845
I guess I didn't realize
Christmas Village

962
00:46:44,889 --> 00:46:46,847
had such strict zoning laws.

963
00:46:46,891 --> 00:46:49,719
I'm just trying to do
Christmas the way my mom did.

964
00:46:49,763 --> 00:46:52,331
I don't want to forget.

965
00:46:52,374 --> 00:46:54,115
Angie, I knew your mom.

966
00:46:54,159 --> 00:46:57,858
There's no way
anyone could forget her.

967
00:46:57,902 --> 00:46:59,512
Well, just make sure

968
00:46:59,555 --> 00:47:02,210
people don't have to walk
too far to the rink, okay?

969
00:47:02,254 --> 00:47:04,560
Wouldn't dream of it.

970
00:47:06,780 --> 00:47:08,956
Aw, what is this?

971
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:10,392
Uh, that's nothing.

972
00:47:10,436 --> 00:47:11,654
You made this.

973
00:47:11,698 --> 00:47:13,308
It's adorable.

974
00:47:13,352 --> 00:47:16,790
We can put it back.

975
00:47:16,834 --> 00:47:20,315
David and his best friend,
Angie.

976
00:47:21,447 --> 00:47:23,144
Wow.

977
00:47:23,710 --> 00:47:26,104
You keep it.

978
00:47:26,147 --> 00:47:28,454
I don't want you
to forget me either.

979
00:47:32,850 --> 00:47:36,157
Hey, did you
save me some gingerbread?

980
00:47:36,201 --> 00:47:38,986
Oh, sorry.

981
00:47:39,944 --> 00:47:41,380
Oh, you're home.

982
00:47:41,423 --> 00:47:42,903
Did you get off work early?

983
00:47:42,947 --> 00:47:45,514
Uh, no.

984
00:47:45,558 --> 00:47:46,689
Oh, wow.

985
00:47:46,733 --> 00:47:48,735
I didn't realize it was so late.

986
00:47:48,778 --> 00:47:51,216
I should get home.

987
00:47:51,999 --> 00:47:54,480
Uh, can you just
put the school next to rink

988
00:47:54,523 --> 00:47:56,743
ya know, for the kids?

989
00:47:56,786 --> 00:47:58,658
Where else would it go?

990
00:48:00,965 --> 00:48:02,967
Thank you.

991
00:48:07,667 --> 00:48:09,190
Good night.

992
00:48:09,234 --> 00:48:10,539
Good night, Lily.

993
00:48:10,583 --> 00:48:12,498
Good night.

994
00:48:34,259 --> 00:48:36,478
No, no, no.
I appreciate it, Chuck.

995
00:48:36,522 --> 00:48:38,089
Yep, I'll see you soon.

996
00:48:38,132 --> 00:48:39,742
Thanks.

997
00:48:41,353 --> 00:48:43,181
What was that about?

998
00:48:43,224 --> 00:48:45,052
Work.

999
00:48:45,096 --> 00:48:46,880
That bad?

1000
00:48:46,924 --> 00:48:48,621
Actually, it was a promotion.

1001
00:48:48,664 --> 00:48:49,927
David, that's great.

1002
00:48:49,970 --> 00:48:51,929
It's about time.

1003
00:48:51,972 --> 00:48:53,254
Except they need me
back in the office

1004
00:48:53,278 --> 00:48:54,975
the day after Christmas.

1005
00:48:55,019 --> 00:48:59,066
Oh, I was just getting used
to having you and Gabby here.

1006
00:48:59,110 --> 00:49:01,677
But it will be nice to have
somewhere warm to visit

1007
00:49:01,721 --> 00:49:04,332
when everyone gets back from
Christmas vacation.

1008
00:49:04,376 --> 00:49:06,769
Nothing like winter in Florida.

1009
00:49:08,989 --> 00:49:10,269
Daddy, did you get the lights?

1010
00:49:10,295 --> 00:49:12,427
Got 'em. Let's go.

1011
00:49:14,560 --> 00:49:16,344
You built a snowman with them?

1012
00:49:16,388 --> 00:49:17,563
That's adorable.

1013
00:49:17,606 --> 00:49:19,478
It's not that adorable.

1014
00:49:19,521 --> 00:49:22,002
Really?
Did the snowman have a name?

1015
00:49:22,046 --> 00:49:23,003
Toasty.

1016
00:49:23,047 --> 00:49:24,613
Toasty?

1017
00:49:24,657 --> 00:49:26,224
Gabby's
a creative little girl, so.

1018
00:49:26,267 --> 00:49:28,966
Right. Gabby's creative
and David is...

1019
00:49:29,009 --> 00:49:30,663
Going back to Florida
in a few weeks.

1020
00:49:30,706 --> 00:49:31,969
His sister lives here.

1021
00:49:32,012 --> 00:49:33,057
He has a daughter.

1022
00:49:33,100 --> 00:49:34,928
Whom you adore
and who loves you.

1023
00:49:34,972 --> 00:49:36,669
And I have Dad to think about.

1024
00:49:36,712 --> 00:49:39,019
And I am just starting
to get my feet set at the store.

1025
00:49:39,063 --> 00:49:40,238
And I just...

1026
00:49:40,281 --> 00:49:41,543
Angie, it's David.

1027
00:49:41,587 --> 00:49:43,086
Yeah, I know it's David
and he's cute,

1028
00:49:43,110 --> 00:49:45,156
but I just don't-
No, Angie. It's David.

1029
00:49:45,199 --> 00:49:47,462
Ah, it's David.

1030
00:49:47,506 --> 00:49:50,683
We were just talkin' about
Toasty.

1031
00:49:50,726 --> 00:49:52,032
Toasty the snowman?

1032
00:49:52,076 --> 00:49:55,035
Yep, mm-hmm. How is he?
Did he sleep okay?

1033
00:49:55,079 --> 00:49:56,689
He looked well rested.

1034
00:49:56,732 --> 00:49:58,821
You should stop over later
and check on him, Ang.

1035
00:49:58,865 --> 00:50:00,562
Okay.

1036
00:50:00,606 --> 00:50:03,913
Ah, how did Gabby like the
decorations?

1037
00:50:03,957 --> 00:50:05,089
You were right.

1038
00:50:05,132 --> 00:50:06,873
She lit up
right when she saw them.

1039
00:50:06,916 --> 00:50:09,267
We spent the entire morning
putting up lights outside.

1040
00:50:09,310 --> 00:50:11,443
Well, she is a natural.

1041
00:50:11,486 --> 00:50:13,595
You know not like someone who
would put the ice-skating rink

1042
00:50:13,619 --> 00:50:15,403
in the wrong place.

1043
00:50:16,230 --> 00:50:17,623
So, what brings you by?

1044
00:50:17,666 --> 00:50:19,340
I was wondering if you two
were coming to

1045
00:50:19,364 --> 00:50:21,279
the Greenpine Grove Town Square

1046
00:50:21,322 --> 00:50:23,542
Christmas Eve Festival of Lights
Christmas Tree

1047
00:50:23,585 --> 00:50:26,023
Decorating Contest
Finalist Gala tonight?

1048
00:50:26,066 --> 00:50:28,068
You rehearsed that, didn't you?

1049
00:50:28,112 --> 00:50:30,984
The whole way here.

1050
00:50:31,028 --> 00:50:32,092
Yeah, I think we are going.

1051
00:50:32,116 --> 00:50:34,074
Right, Blair?
Oh, definitely.

1052
00:50:34,118 --> 00:50:35,443
It's gonna be
a little late for Gabby,

1053
00:50:35,467 --> 00:50:36,990
so Lily said she'd watch her,

1054
00:50:37,034 --> 00:50:38,228
but maybe we could
all go together?

1055
00:50:38,252 --> 00:50:40,776
No.

1056
00:50:40,820 --> 00:50:42,691
I just remembered.

1057
00:50:42,735 --> 00:50:44,302
I have plans.

1058
00:50:44,345 --> 00:50:45,738
What? What plans?

1059
00:50:45,781 --> 00:50:46,913
Definite plans.

1060
00:50:46,956 --> 00:50:48,436
Big ones.

1061
00:50:48,480 --> 00:50:50,351
Definite, big plans.

1062
00:50:50,395 --> 00:50:51,265
That's too bad.

1063
00:50:51,309 --> 00:50:52,919
Isn't it?

1064
00:50:52,962 --> 00:50:56,096
So, I guess you two are gonna
have to go without me.

1065
00:50:58,533 --> 00:51:00,970
So, you'll pick her up, right?

1066
00:51:01,014 --> 00:51:03,451
I think I remember the way.

1067
00:51:03,495 --> 00:51:05,758
See you tonight.
Okay.

1068
00:51:08,630 --> 00:51:10,371
You do not have plans.

1069
00:51:10,415 --> 00:51:12,591
But you do.

1070
00:51:16,029 --> 00:51:17,117
Come on in.

1071
00:51:17,161 --> 00:51:18,597
Can I get you anything?

1072
00:51:18,640 --> 00:51:21,730
Apple cider, eggnog,
a Colosseum made of gingerbread.

1073
00:51:21,774 --> 00:51:23,515
No thank you,
but my daughter and I

1074
00:51:23,558 --> 00:51:25,473
did enjoy your
Ginger Gate Bridge.

1075
00:51:25,517 --> 00:51:27,930
Yeah, Angie mentioned that you
have a daughter of your own now.

1076
00:51:27,954 --> 00:51:30,130
Yeah.

1077
00:51:30,174 --> 00:51:33,351
Gabby, she's 10.

1078
00:51:33,394 --> 00:51:34,961
She has your eyes.

1079
00:51:35,004 --> 00:51:37,224
And the rest of her mother's
features fortunately.

1080
00:51:37,268 --> 00:51:38,462
Angie told me
you lost your wife.

1081
00:51:38,486 --> 00:51:40,053
I'm so sorry.

1082
00:51:40,097 --> 00:51:43,491
Yeah, I'm sorry to hear about
Mrs. Waldron.

1083
00:51:43,535 --> 00:51:46,059
She always made this place feel
like a second home to me.

1084
00:51:46,103 --> 00:51:47,452
She had a knack for that.

1085
00:51:47,495 --> 00:51:48,994
Could meet a stranger
and within five minutes,

1086
00:51:49,018 --> 00:51:51,760
they're laughing like they've
been friends forever.

1087
00:51:51,804 --> 00:51:53,980
Angie takes after her
in that way.

1088
00:51:54,023 --> 00:51:57,288
I do see
a little bit of Angela in Angie

1089
00:51:57,331 --> 00:51:58,941
every time I look at her.

1090
00:51:58,985 --> 00:52:02,075
I'm sure it's the same
with you and Gabby.

1091
00:52:03,250 --> 00:52:05,818
So how long you in town for?

1092
00:52:05,861 --> 00:52:07,622
I was supposed to be
leaving in a couple of weeks,

1093
00:52:07,646 --> 00:52:09,430
but I uh...

1094
00:52:18,483 --> 00:52:20,876
Wow, you look beautiful.

1095
00:52:22,487 --> 00:52:25,925
You don't look so bad yourself.

1096
00:52:27,709 --> 00:52:30,582
All right. We should get going.

1097
00:52:32,366 --> 00:52:34,063
Thanks.

1098
00:52:34,716 --> 00:52:36,022
I will be home at 11:00.

1099
00:52:36,065 --> 00:52:37,632
Then I will see you at 11:00.

1100
00:52:37,676 --> 00:52:39,373
You don't have to wait up
for me, Dad.

1101
00:52:39,417 --> 00:52:41,506
Oh, come on.
It'll be like old times.

1102
00:52:41,549 --> 00:52:42,507
Speaking of which-

1103
00:52:42,550 --> 00:52:45,640
- Dad, I am 30 years old.

1104
00:52:46,641 --> 00:52:48,861
Fine.

1105
00:52:48,904 --> 00:52:50,317
Okay, you kids don't
stay out too late

1106
00:52:50,341 --> 00:52:51,951
on a school night, or I will-

1107
00:52:51,994 --> 00:52:54,780
Come looking for you
in my bathrobe.

1108
00:52:56,042 --> 00:52:58,131
- Bye, Dad.
- Bye, sweetie.

1109
00:53:07,009 --> 00:53:09,360
Your dad's just like I remember.

1110
00:53:21,763 --> 00:53:23,417
- Wow.
- It's beautiful.

1111
00:53:23,461 --> 00:53:25,550
There they are.

1112
00:53:25,593 --> 00:53:29,597
Angie, David,
don't you both look wonderful?

1113
00:53:29,641 --> 00:53:32,426
So dashing, so lovely.

1114
00:53:32,470 --> 00:53:34,254
Everyone's talking
about you two.

1115
00:53:34,298 --> 00:53:37,388
- Oh.
- We're just here for a dance.

1116
00:53:37,431 --> 00:53:39,912
As the trees to beat.

1117
00:53:39,955 --> 00:53:42,001
- Oh, well, that's...
- Flattering.

1118
00:53:42,044 --> 00:53:43,350
Yeah, we both really-

1119
00:53:43,394 --> 00:53:45,222
- Love trees.

1120
00:53:45,265 --> 00:53:49,574
Oh. Well, I will see you two
on the dance floor.

1121
00:53:54,274 --> 00:53:56,494
- So.
- So.

1122
00:53:59,105 --> 00:54:00,324
Isn't this?

1123
00:54:00,367 --> 00:54:03,457
Our senior prom song.

1124
00:54:04,502 --> 00:54:06,460
Let's see if
I remember how to do this.

1125
00:54:06,504 --> 00:54:09,420
I know I don't.

1126
00:54:12,249 --> 00:54:15,339
Senior prom feels like
a lifetime ago.

1127
00:54:15,382 --> 00:54:18,864
But also, like just yesterday.

1128
00:54:18,907 --> 00:54:21,040
One of my best memories
from high school,

1129
00:54:21,083 --> 00:54:23,695
though it started as
one of the worst.

1130
00:54:23,738 --> 00:54:27,655
What are the chances we'd both
get dumped right before prom?

1131
00:54:27,699 --> 00:54:28,961
You worked out okay.

1132
00:54:29,004 --> 00:54:31,006
Better than okay.

1133
00:54:31,050 --> 00:54:34,532
I just wish
we'd stayed in touch.

1134
00:54:35,750 --> 00:54:37,970
I left to college,
got married, had Gabby.

1135
00:54:38,013 --> 00:54:39,014
You know how it is.

1136
00:54:39,058 --> 00:54:40,973
Life happens.

1137
00:54:41,016 --> 00:54:42,322
I know.

1138
00:54:42,366 --> 00:54:45,804
I'm just glad that you're back.

1139
00:54:45,847 --> 00:54:47,545
So am I.

1140
00:54:55,727 --> 00:54:57,119
I did not do that.

1141
00:54:57,163 --> 00:54:59,600
Yes, you did.
You totally did that.

1142
00:55:01,472 --> 00:55:04,475
Ah, it's funny being back here.

1143
00:55:04,518 --> 00:55:08,000
All these old memories coming
back, seeing old friends.

1144
00:55:08,043 --> 00:55:11,351
I'm happy to be reconnecting
with everybody.

1145
00:55:12,831 --> 00:55:16,617
I am sure everybody is happy
to be reconnecting with you.

1146
00:55:25,887 --> 00:55:27,541
There you are.

1147
00:55:27,585 --> 00:55:29,587
I thought I heard voices.

1148
00:55:29,630 --> 00:55:30,936
Did you have a nice time?

1149
00:55:30,979 --> 00:55:32,285
- Yeah.
- It was perfect.

1150
00:55:32,329 --> 00:55:33,393
Hey, would you like
some hot chocolate?

1151
00:55:33,417 --> 00:55:35,332
Dad.

1152
00:55:35,375 --> 00:55:36,463
Oh, oh, uh...

1153
00:55:36,507 --> 00:55:39,423
I left something on the stove.

1154
00:55:41,381 --> 00:55:44,471
Thank you for tonight.

1155
00:55:44,515 --> 00:55:45,690
Good night, Angie.

1156
00:55:45,733 --> 00:55:47,605
Good night, David.

1157
00:55:57,745 --> 00:56:00,182
Okay, thank you for checking.

1158
00:56:00,226 --> 00:56:01,662
Merry Christmas.

1159
00:56:02,707 --> 00:56:04,143
Still no luck?

1160
00:56:04,186 --> 00:56:06,406
Why can't her favorite flower
be a poinsettia?

1161
00:56:06,450 --> 00:56:07,538
Or a rhododendron?

1162
00:56:07,581 --> 00:56:09,322
I can source rhododendrons.

1163
00:56:09,366 --> 00:56:11,803
I can't even spell it.

1164
00:56:11,846 --> 00:56:14,762
You sure are spending a lot of
time on finding sunflowers.

1165
00:56:14,806 --> 00:56:16,895
It's all she wants for
Christmas, Blair.

1166
00:56:16,938 --> 00:56:18,984
Oh, I know.
I'm just sayin' maybe it's

1167
00:56:19,027 --> 00:56:22,379
less about Gabby and more about
a certain someone else.

1168
00:56:22,422 --> 00:56:26,339
Look, I...
have to take this call.

1169
00:56:26,383 --> 00:56:27,688
Hmm.

1170
00:56:27,732 --> 00:56:29,603
This is Angie.

1171
00:56:29,647 --> 00:56:32,432
You do? That's great.

1172
00:56:32,476 --> 00:56:36,349
No, no, no, no, no.
I need them before Christmas.

1173
00:56:36,393 --> 00:56:38,395
Uh, okay.

1174
00:56:38,438 --> 00:56:40,701
Thank you for letting me know.

1175
00:56:42,224 --> 00:56:43,530
Bad luck?

1176
00:56:43,574 --> 00:56:45,706
That was Morgan's Nursery
in North Dakota.

1177
00:56:45,750 --> 00:56:47,142
Apparently,
they have sunflowers,

1178
00:56:47,186 --> 00:56:48,206
but they're not
making any deliveries

1179
00:56:48,230 --> 00:56:50,276
until after Christmas.

1180
00:56:50,319 --> 00:56:51,625
I'm sorry, Ang.

1181
00:56:51,669 --> 00:56:53,366
Me, too.

1182
00:56:53,410 --> 00:56:56,325
I guess I should break the news
to David.

1183
00:56:59,981 --> 00:57:01,940
Oh, look who it is.

1184
00:57:01,983 --> 00:57:04,638
What do you think?
Here or by the fireplace?

1185
00:57:04,682 --> 00:57:06,292
That thing?

1186
00:57:06,335 --> 00:57:08,294
Maybe in the fireplace.

1187
00:57:08,337 --> 00:57:09,904
Where's your Christmas spirit?

1188
00:57:09,948 --> 00:57:11,993
I think it got lost
in the thicket of garland

1189
00:57:12,037 --> 00:57:13,952
you hung over my bathroom sink.

1190
00:57:13,995 --> 00:57:16,258
Hey, you're the one who
suggested we decorate.

1191
00:57:16,302 --> 00:57:17,497
And you're the one
who reminded me

1192
00:57:17,521 --> 00:57:19,261
we'd have to
pack it all away again.

1193
00:57:19,305 --> 00:57:21,176
I can take care of it.

1194
00:57:21,220 --> 00:57:24,484
Might be a little tough
to do from Florida, Dave.

1195
00:57:24,528 --> 00:57:27,879
Right, the promotion.

1196
00:57:27,922 --> 00:57:29,228
Have you told Gabby yet?

1197
00:57:29,271 --> 00:57:31,709
Uh, no.

1198
00:57:31,752 --> 00:57:34,059
There's someone else
I want to tell first.

1199
00:57:38,150 --> 00:57:40,500
- David.
- Hi.

1200
00:57:40,544 --> 00:57:42,284
I know why you're here.

1201
00:57:42,328 --> 00:57:43,372
You do?

1202
00:57:43,416 --> 00:57:45,374
And I am so sorry.

1203
00:57:45,418 --> 00:57:47,091
Blair and I have called
everywhere and there's no way

1204
00:57:47,115 --> 00:57:48,789
we can get sunflowers
in time for Christmas.

1205
00:57:48,813 --> 00:57:51,642
Oh.

1206
00:57:51,685 --> 00:57:54,079
I knew it was a long shot.

1207
00:57:54,122 --> 00:57:57,648
Um, but thank you for trying.

1208
00:57:57,691 --> 00:57:59,519
Angie...
Actually, I do

1209
00:57:59,563 --> 00:58:00,955
have something for Gabby.

1210
00:58:00,999 --> 00:58:03,262
What's that?

1211
00:58:03,305 --> 00:58:04,959
This is Geraldine.

1212
00:58:05,003 --> 00:58:06,763
She's had a really rough start
and she needs someone

1213
00:58:06,787 --> 00:58:08,310
who can look past what she is

1214
00:58:08,354 --> 00:58:11,270
and see what
she can still become.

1215
00:58:11,313 --> 00:58:13,881
I think Gabby's that person.

1216
00:58:13,925 --> 00:58:15,317
And I know it's no sunflowers

1217
00:58:15,361 --> 00:58:17,494
and it's not
the hot toy of the season, but-

1218
00:58:17,537 --> 00:58:20,279
- It's perfect.

1219
00:58:23,151 --> 00:58:25,284
Thank you.

1220
00:58:27,025 --> 00:58:30,332
Ah, was there something else?

1221
00:58:30,376 --> 00:58:33,205
Actually, yes.

1222
00:58:36,338 --> 00:58:39,951
Gabby's been begging me
to build another snowman.

1223
00:58:39,994 --> 00:58:42,606
But we both know
we can't do it without you.

1224
00:58:42,649 --> 00:58:47,393
Blair's off today,
but I can come tomorrow.

1225
00:58:47,436 --> 00:58:49,351
Gabby would love to see you.

1226
00:58:49,395 --> 00:58:53,138
Well, I would love to see Gabby.

1227
00:58:53,181 --> 00:58:55,532
One o'clock?
One o'clock.

1228
00:59:02,756 --> 00:59:05,585
Daddy, can Angie stay
for dinner tonight?

1229
00:59:05,629 --> 00:59:07,302
Well, I don't know, sweetie.
We'll have to ask her.

1230
00:59:07,326 --> 00:59:08,501
I hope she can.

1231
00:59:08,545 --> 00:59:10,198
She makes me laugh.

1232
00:59:10,242 --> 00:59:12,331
Me, too.

1233
00:59:12,374 --> 00:59:13,288
Hey, guys.

1234
00:59:13,332 --> 00:59:15,029
She returns.

1235
00:59:15,073 --> 00:59:16,683
- Hi, Aunt Lily.
- Hi, Sunshine.

1236
00:59:18,337 --> 00:59:20,600
How many overnights is that
in a row for you?

1237
00:59:20,644 --> 00:59:25,474
I'm not sure, is there a
number higher than infinity?

1238
00:59:25,518 --> 00:59:26,650
You must be beat.

1239
00:59:26,693 --> 00:59:27,844
Can I get you some breakfast?

1240
00:59:27,868 --> 00:59:29,653
Yes, please. I'm starving.

1241
00:59:29,696 --> 00:59:31,326
You're comin' to the finals
tomorrow, right?

1242
00:59:31,350 --> 00:59:34,396
Wouldn't miss it.

1243
00:59:34,440 --> 00:59:35,635
Hey, why don't you go get
dressed, sweetie?

1244
00:59:35,659 --> 00:59:38,400
Okay.

1245
00:59:38,444 --> 00:59:40,074
So I was meaning to talk to
you about something.

1246
00:59:40,098 --> 00:59:41,926
Mm-hmm?

1247
00:59:43,188 --> 00:59:46,147
I'm not gonna take that
promotion in Florida.

1248
00:59:46,191 --> 00:59:49,586
I was thinkin' about stayin' in
town for a while.

1249
00:59:49,629 --> 00:59:52,763
Maybe even...

1250
01:00:01,293 --> 01:00:04,252
There you go. Yep.

1251
01:00:04,296 --> 01:00:05,490
Sorry, guys.
I gotta take this.

1252
01:00:05,514 --> 01:00:07,560
I'll be right back.

1253
01:00:11,172 --> 01:00:12,957
Hi, Chuck.

1254
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:15,481
Hey, thanks for calling me back.

1255
01:00:15,524 --> 01:00:18,658
I know what I said, but I can't
be back in Florida right now.

1256
01:00:18,702 --> 01:00:19,746
No, no, no, no.

1257
01:00:19,790 --> 01:00:20,984
I know it's a great opportunity.

1258
01:00:21,008 --> 01:00:22,619
I just, uh...

1259
01:00:26,100 --> 01:00:29,321
I think there's an opportunity
for me here.

1260
01:00:30,757 --> 01:00:32,672
Bye.

1261
01:00:35,414 --> 01:00:37,068
Everything okay?

1262
01:00:37,111 --> 01:00:39,157
Ah, unfortunately no.

1263
01:00:39,200 --> 01:00:40,854
There's been a report

1264
01:00:40,898 --> 01:00:43,683
of a massive snow
fight in our yard.

1265
01:00:43,727 --> 01:00:45,554
Take cover, Gabs.

1266
01:00:45,598 --> 01:00:47,339
I'm gonna get you.
I'm gonna get you.

1267
01:00:47,382 --> 01:00:48,645
Yeah.

1268
01:00:49,297 --> 01:00:50,690
Geraldine?

1269
01:00:50,734 --> 01:00:52,561
She needs lots of sunshine,
lots of water,

1270
01:00:52,605 --> 01:00:54,607
but mostly she needs
a lot of love.

1271
01:00:54,651 --> 01:00:56,304
I thought maybe she should
belong to you.

1272
01:00:56,348 --> 01:00:57,392
Thank you, Angie.

1273
01:00:57,436 --> 01:00:59,699
You're welcome.

1274
01:00:59,743 --> 01:01:00,874
Can I water her now?

1275
01:01:00,918 --> 01:01:02,093
Yeah, that's a great idea.

1276
01:01:02,136 --> 01:01:04,748
She's lookin' kinda thirsty.

1277
01:01:05,749 --> 01:01:06,793
Hi, Aunt Lily.

1278
01:01:06,837 --> 01:01:08,316
Well, hello.

1279
01:01:08,360 --> 01:01:09,491
Hi, Angie. Good morning.

1280
01:01:09,535 --> 01:01:10,797
Hello.

1281
01:01:10,841 --> 01:01:12,103
It's 3:00 PM.

1282
01:01:12,146 --> 01:01:14,758
Time has no meaning to me
anymore.

1283
01:01:14,801 --> 01:01:17,064
How much water do I put in?

1284
01:01:17,108 --> 01:01:20,981
I better go check on Geraldine
before she needs a lifeguard.

1285
01:01:22,766 --> 01:01:24,376
So big day tomorrow,
you excited?

1286
01:01:24,419 --> 01:01:25,594
Mm-hmm.

1287
01:01:25,638 --> 01:01:27,553
And a little nervous.

1288
01:01:27,596 --> 01:01:30,121
David and Gabby
are some tough competition.

1289
01:01:30,164 --> 01:01:32,403
It's too bad they won't be
here to enjoy it if they win.

1290
01:01:32,427 --> 01:01:33,907
What do you mean?

1291
01:01:33,951 --> 01:01:36,475
Oh, you know, David's
promotion back in Florida.

1292
01:01:36,518 --> 01:01:38,433
I wish they could at least
stay for Christmas,

1293
01:01:38,477 --> 01:01:41,741
but I guess they need him
in the office the day after, so.

1294
01:01:41,785 --> 01:01:43,874
That's so soon.

1295
01:01:43,917 --> 01:01:45,745
I know.

1296
01:01:45,789 --> 01:01:47,616
Actually, I have to admit,

1297
01:01:47,660 --> 01:01:49,749
I'm a little disappointed.

1298
01:01:49,793 --> 01:01:52,970
David said there was nothing
between you two,

1299
01:01:53,013 --> 01:01:55,494
but I kinda hoped there was.

1300
01:01:55,537 --> 01:01:59,411
I guess I let my imagination
run away with me.

1301
01:01:59,454 --> 01:02:02,588
Yeah, that's uh, that's funny.

1302
01:02:04,895 --> 01:02:06,592
Uh, you know what, Lily?

1303
01:02:06,635 --> 01:02:08,463
I actually have to
get back to the nursery.

1304
01:02:08,507 --> 01:02:10,509
Will you tell David and Gabby
I said goodbye?

1305
01:02:10,552 --> 01:02:12,052
Yeah, I'm sure they'll be
right back.

1306
01:02:12,076 --> 01:02:14,905
Blair's waiting for me, so.

1307
01:02:14,948 --> 01:02:17,255
Okay, see you tomorrow.

1308
01:02:20,737 --> 01:02:23,130
Uh, where's Angie?

1309
01:02:28,440 --> 01:02:30,224
Hey, you leaving?

1310
01:02:30,268 --> 01:02:31,922
Uh, I need to
get back to the nursery.

1311
01:02:31,965 --> 01:02:33,532
Blair's waiting for me.

1312
01:02:33,575 --> 01:02:34,683
I was hoping we could talk.

1313
01:02:34,707 --> 01:02:36,970
About your promotion?

1314
01:02:37,014 --> 01:02:38,972
How did you know about that?

1315
01:02:39,016 --> 01:02:40,931
Lily told me.

1316
01:02:40,974 --> 01:02:43,368
Congratulations, that's uh,
that's really great news.

1317
01:02:43,411 --> 01:02:44,606
- Actually, um-
- I'm sure you're ready

1318
01:02:44,630 --> 01:02:46,850
to get home,
back to your real life.

1319
01:02:46,893 --> 01:02:48,610
I'm sure Gabby's excited
to see her friends.

1320
01:02:48,634 --> 01:02:51,071
- Well, I...
- You know it's for the best.

1321
01:02:51,115 --> 01:02:52,832
I've spent way too much time
away from the nursery,

1322
01:02:52,856 --> 01:02:58,383
so, it's time I start focusing
on what really matters.

1323
01:02:58,426 --> 01:03:01,734
It's been really great
catching up with you,

1324
01:03:01,778 --> 01:03:05,216
but it's time we both get back
to our real lives.

1325
01:03:05,259 --> 01:03:07,784
Right, real life.

1326
01:03:10,308 --> 01:03:13,790
Tell Gabby
I'll see her tomorrow.

1327
01:03:16,314 --> 01:03:18,577
Angie...

1328
01:03:23,408 --> 01:03:25,627
Good luck tomorrow.

1329
01:03:28,630 --> 01:03:30,894
You, too.

1330
01:03:59,748 --> 01:04:02,012
David, is everything okay?

1331
01:04:02,055 --> 01:04:03,796
Of course.

1332
01:04:03,840 --> 01:04:06,538
I just didn't want to leave
all this with you to clean up.

1333
01:04:06,581 --> 01:04:11,282
I meant is everything okay
with you and Angie?

1334
01:04:11,325 --> 01:04:14,154
There is no me and Angie.

1335
01:04:14,198 --> 01:04:16,548
She has her store and her dad
here in Greenpine Grove.

1336
01:04:16,591 --> 01:04:19,899
And I have a promotion
and Gabby in Florida.

1337
01:04:19,943 --> 01:04:22,510
It's about time we all get back
to our real lives.

1338
01:04:22,554 --> 01:04:23,860
Real lives?

1339
01:04:25,818 --> 01:04:27,820
That's what she said.

1340
01:04:27,864 --> 01:04:30,301
David...

1341
01:04:34,783 --> 01:04:36,742
I better put this
back in the basement.

1342
01:05:26,009 --> 01:05:27,924
Hey, Lita, how are ya?

1343
01:05:29,360 --> 01:05:31,101
There we go.

1344
01:05:31,144 --> 01:05:32,885
Oop.

1345
01:05:35,061 --> 01:05:36,933
All right,
I think that's everything.

1346
01:05:39,631 --> 01:05:41,502
Hi.

1347
01:05:43,287 --> 01:05:44,984
Hi.

1348
01:05:45,028 --> 01:05:48,205
I just wanted to say it's been
fun competing against you.

1349
01:05:51,034 --> 01:05:53,601
Angie?

1350
01:05:53,645 --> 01:05:55,299
Hey, Gabby.

1351
01:05:55,342 --> 01:05:58,824
It's been fun being in this
competition with you, too.

1352
01:06:15,493 --> 01:06:18,017
Do you want to talk about it?

1353
01:06:18,061 --> 01:06:19,540
There's nothing to talk about.

1354
01:06:19,584 --> 01:06:21,605
I always knew he was planning on
going back to Florida.

1355
01:06:21,629 --> 01:06:24,023
Well, maybe there's more
to the story.

1356
01:06:24,067 --> 01:06:26,591
Well, if there was then
he would have told me himself.

1357
01:06:26,634 --> 01:06:30,029
I had to find out he was leaving
from his sister.

1358
01:06:30,073 --> 01:06:31,509
- Angie.
- Blair.

1359
01:06:31,552 --> 01:06:32,814
Please.

1360
01:06:32,858 --> 01:06:35,687
I just wanna
focus on the contest.

1361
01:06:35,730 --> 01:06:37,254
For my mom.

1362
01:06:37,297 --> 01:06:39,647
It's gonna look beautiful,
Angie.

1363
01:06:39,691 --> 01:06:41,084
Thank you.

1364
01:06:41,127 --> 01:06:43,564
I think it's exactly
what she would've wanted.

1365
01:06:43,608 --> 01:06:46,219
Attention, everyone.

1366
01:06:46,263 --> 01:06:50,615
Welcome to the 21st Annual
Greenpine Grove Town Square

1367
01:06:50,658 --> 01:06:52,965
Christmas Eve Festival of Lights

1368
01:06:53,009 --> 01:06:56,403
Christmas Tree
Decorating Finals!

1369
01:06:58,057 --> 01:07:00,581
Today's winning tree
will be featured in our annual

1370
01:07:00,625 --> 01:07:03,584
tree lighting tomorrow night
for Christmas Eve.

1371
01:07:03,628 --> 01:07:06,413
The theme for the final round
has been the same

1372
01:07:06,457 --> 01:07:08,546
since the very first
competition,

1373
01:07:08,589 --> 01:07:11,027
the meaning of Christmas.

1374
01:07:11,070 --> 01:07:13,855
And remember,
part of the judge's decision

1375
01:07:13,899 --> 01:07:17,555
is based on the votes of you,
the audience.

1376
01:07:17,598 --> 01:07:19,426
Contestants ready?

1377
01:07:19,470 --> 01:07:20,862
On your marks.

1378
01:07:20,906 --> 01:07:22,342
Get set.

1379
01:07:22,386 --> 01:07:24,866
Decorate!

1380
01:08:23,663 --> 01:08:25,231
Time.

1381
01:08:26,537 --> 01:08:27,755
Voting begins now.

1382
01:08:27,799 --> 01:08:30,367
We will announce the winners
at 5:00.

1383
01:08:31,063 --> 01:08:32,586
It's beautiful, Ang.

1384
01:08:32,630 --> 01:08:34,110
I couldn't have done it
without you.

1385
01:08:38,069 --> 01:08:40,420
Angie, Blair, my goodness.

1386
01:08:40,464 --> 01:08:42,509
Please tell me about your tree.

1387
01:08:42,553 --> 01:08:45,947
Well, my favorite memories
of Christmas are of my mom

1388
01:08:45,991 --> 01:08:48,907
baking, wrapping presents,
decorating.

1389
01:08:48,950 --> 01:08:50,102
She always made sure
everyone around her

1390
01:08:50,126 --> 01:08:51,823
had the best Christmas possible.

1391
01:08:51,866 --> 01:08:54,956
So, I wanted to decorate this
tree in her memory.

1392
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:56,957
Roses were her favorite.

1393
01:08:57,002 --> 01:08:59,135
Honoring my mom
and what Christmas meant to her,

1394
01:08:59,178 --> 01:09:01,746
it's what Christmas means to me.

1395
01:09:01,788 --> 01:09:03,791
Well, I have to say,
you've outdone yourselves.

1396
01:09:03,835 --> 01:09:06,054
It's simply beautiful.

1397
01:09:06,098 --> 01:09:08,492
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1398
01:09:11,277 --> 01:09:15,238
David, Gabby,
another beautiful presentation.

1399
01:09:15,281 --> 01:09:17,370
Tell me about your tree.

1400
01:09:17,413 --> 01:09:21,679
Well, this Christmas was, uh...

1401
01:09:22,854 --> 01:09:25,639
different than the last
couple of years.

1402
01:09:25,683 --> 01:09:27,380
We decided we couldn't pick
just one thing

1403
01:09:27,424 --> 01:09:29,426
to represent
the meaning of Christmas.

1404
01:09:29,469 --> 01:09:30,948
So, we have ornaments
of everything

1405
01:09:30,992 --> 01:09:32,689
we did this Christmas.

1406
01:09:32,733 --> 01:09:36,215
Decorating the tree,
drinking hot chocolate,

1407
01:09:36,259 --> 01:09:38,348
and building a snowman.

1408
01:09:38,390 --> 01:09:40,785
Well, it is simply superb.

1409
01:09:40,828 --> 01:09:42,352
Beautifully done,
David and Gabby.

1410
01:09:42,395 --> 01:09:43,613
Thank you for your tree.

1411
01:09:43,657 --> 01:09:46,529
Thank you.

1412
01:09:57,932 --> 01:10:01,414
Let's have one more round of
applause for our finalists.

1413
01:10:04,722 --> 01:10:06,724
This has been
the toughest decision I've made

1414
01:10:06,767 --> 01:10:08,856
in my years as a judge.

1415
01:10:08,900 --> 01:10:12,425
It came down to the voters
and they had a clear favorite.

1416
01:10:12,469 --> 01:10:15,428
Can I have a drumroll, please?

1417
01:10:15,472 --> 01:10:20,085
The winners of the 21st Annual
Greenpine Grove Town Square

1418
01:10:20,128 --> 01:10:22,043
Christmas Eve Festival of Lights

1419
01:10:22,087 --> 01:10:24,829
Christmas Tree
Decorating Contest Finals

1420
01:10:24,872 --> 01:10:28,093
The Meaning of Christmas are...

1421
01:10:29,312 --> 01:10:32,140
Angie Waldron and Blair Baulin.

1422
01:10:34,404 --> 01:10:36,232
Oh, congratulations
Angie and Blair

1423
01:10:36,275 --> 01:10:38,625
on your beautiful tree
and on capturing

1424
01:10:38,669 --> 01:10:41,454
the meaning of Christmas.

1425
01:10:41,498 --> 01:10:44,762
Remember, the tree lighting is
tomorrow night at six o'clock.

1426
01:10:44,805 --> 01:10:47,243
We'll see you all there.

1427
01:10:50,333 --> 01:10:51,551
Congratulations.

1428
01:10:51,595 --> 01:10:52,987
Thank you.

1429
01:10:53,031 --> 01:10:54,685
I'm sure it was
a really close vote.

1430
01:10:54,728 --> 01:10:57,165
Congratulations, Angie.

1431
01:10:57,209 --> 01:10:59,080
Thanks, Gabby.
You know, meeting you

1432
01:10:59,124 --> 01:11:02,083
was the best part
of this whole experience.

1433
01:11:02,127 --> 01:11:05,478
Do you want to come
get hot chocolate with us?

1434
01:11:05,522 --> 01:11:07,132
Uh, you know what?

1435
01:11:07,175 --> 01:11:09,830
I actually have to be somewhere,

1436
01:11:09,874 --> 01:11:13,094
but you guys have fun, okay?

1437
01:11:13,138 --> 01:11:15,923
Gabby, I know if your mom
were here right now

1438
01:11:15,967 --> 01:11:18,578
she would be so proud
of your decorating.

1439
01:11:18,622 --> 01:11:21,799
Take good care of Geraldine,
okay?

1440
01:11:42,733 --> 01:11:44,256
Come here, Gabs.

1441
01:11:47,346 --> 01:11:48,826
I've got some good news.
What?

1442
01:11:48,869 --> 01:11:50,436
We're going back to Florida.

1443
01:11:50,480 --> 01:11:52,177
What?

1444
01:11:52,220 --> 01:11:55,223
I got a new job and school's
about to start again soon.

1445
01:11:55,267 --> 01:11:56,834
You get to see all your friends.

1446
01:11:58,662 --> 01:12:00,881
What's wrong, sweetie?
I thought you'd be excited.

1447
01:12:00,925 --> 01:12:03,144
What about Aunt Lily?

1448
01:12:03,188 --> 01:12:04,929
She'll come visit.

1449
01:12:04,972 --> 01:12:06,583
She's taking us
to the airport tomorrow.

1450
01:12:06,626 --> 01:12:08,236
Tomorrow?

1451
01:12:08,280 --> 01:12:09,586
We have to get back, Gabs.

1452
01:12:09,629 --> 01:12:11,501
I start my new job right away.

1453
01:12:11,544 --> 01:12:12,632
We can't leave tomorrow.

1454
01:12:12,676 --> 01:12:14,025
What about Angie?

1455
01:12:14,068 --> 01:12:17,420
We can't leave
without telling her goodbye.

1456
01:12:17,463 --> 01:12:20,379
- Gabby.
- What about the tree lighting?

1457
01:12:20,423 --> 01:12:22,468
You promised.

1458
01:12:26,211 --> 01:12:27,778
Okay.

1459
01:12:27,821 --> 01:12:31,042
We can stay
for the tree lighting, okay?

1460
01:12:31,085 --> 01:12:33,914
You can say goodbye to Angie.

1461
01:12:33,958 --> 01:12:35,438
It's gonna be for the best,
Gabs.

1462
01:12:35,481 --> 01:12:37,875
You'll see.

1463
01:12:47,450 --> 01:12:50,278
Everything all right,
sweetheart?

1464
01:12:50,322 --> 01:12:53,456
Yeah. Why do you ask?

1465
01:12:53,499 --> 01:12:56,981
Well, mainly because your

1466
01:12:57,024 --> 01:12:59,549
gingerbread house is lookin'
more like a

1467
01:12:59,592 --> 01:13:01,855
gingerbread pile.

1468
01:13:03,379 --> 01:13:06,991
Sorry,
I'm just a little distracted.

1469
01:13:07,034 --> 01:13:10,560
Would this have anything to do
with David?

1470
01:13:10,603 --> 01:13:13,171
I knew this Christmas
was going to be tough.

1471
01:13:13,214 --> 01:13:14,825
But then
David and Gabby came here,

1472
01:13:14,868 --> 01:13:16,435
and I just thought maybe...

1473
01:13:18,698 --> 01:13:20,918
And now I'm losing them, too.
Ang.

1474
01:13:20,961 --> 01:13:22,615
All I wanted
for Christmas this year

1475
01:13:22,659 --> 01:13:24,661
was to win that contest

1476
01:13:24,704 --> 01:13:26,116
and decorate the tree
in Mom's honor.

1477
01:13:26,140 --> 01:13:28,099
And you did.

1478
01:13:28,142 --> 01:13:30,928
So why does it feel like
something is still missing?

1479
01:13:32,625 --> 01:13:35,498
I don't know, Ang.

1480
01:13:35,541 --> 01:13:38,805
Dad, I miss Mom so much.

1481
01:13:41,199 --> 01:13:43,767
I do, too, sweetheart.

1482
01:13:43,810 --> 01:13:45,595
I do, too.

1483
01:13:47,205 --> 01:13:49,033
Hey, did I ever tell you

1484
01:13:49,076 --> 01:13:53,080
about our first Christmas
with your mom?

1485
01:13:53,124 --> 01:13:55,779
Well, your mom had
just started the nursery.

1486
01:13:55,822 --> 01:13:59,435
And I was trying to support us
as a new teacher.

1487
01:13:59,478 --> 01:14:03,482
Broke doesn't begin
to describe it.

1488
01:14:03,526 --> 01:14:06,529
But your mom wanted to make sure
that we had a perfect Christmas,

1489
01:14:06,572 --> 01:14:09,793
so, she splurged and bought a
turkey for Christmas dinner

1490
01:14:09,836 --> 01:14:11,316
with all the trimmings.

1491
01:14:11,359 --> 01:14:12,709
That sounds like Mom.

1492
01:14:12,752 --> 01:14:16,495
So, she was cooking
and I was on a ladder

1493
01:14:16,539 --> 01:14:18,671
trying to keep the star
on top of the tree.

1494
01:14:18,715 --> 01:14:20,891
Suddenly, I lost my balance.

1495
01:14:20,934 --> 01:14:23,110
Oh, I took the whole tree
down with me.

1496
01:14:23,154 --> 01:14:24,460
Broke half the ornaments

1497
01:14:24,503 --> 01:14:25,872
and crushed all the presents
underneath.

1498
01:14:25,896 --> 01:14:27,550
- Oh, no.
- Your mom rushed in

1499
01:14:27,593 --> 01:14:29,813
to help me up and didn't realize

1500
01:14:29,856 --> 01:14:31,858
she'd left the turkey

1501
01:14:31,902 --> 01:14:34,295
where our little dog, Nellie,
could reach it.

1502
01:14:34,339 --> 01:14:35,862
Did Nellie?

1503
01:14:35,906 --> 01:14:41,215
Oh, Nellie had the best
Christmas feast of her life.

1504
01:14:41,259 --> 01:14:44,175
And then your mom and I...

1505
01:14:46,177 --> 01:14:47,787
Your mom and I...

1506
01:14:49,572 --> 01:14:52,705
ended up having,
sharing a can of green beans

1507
01:14:52,749 --> 01:14:54,359
and some toast for dinner.

1508
01:14:55,621 --> 01:14:58,581
- Sounds awful.
- No.

1509
01:14:58,624 --> 01:15:00,800
It wasn't, darling. Not at all.

1510
01:15:02,628 --> 01:15:03,988
When I look back over
all the years

1511
01:15:04,021 --> 01:15:06,806
your mother and I
shared together,

1512
01:15:06,850 --> 01:15:08,808
all the Christmas dinners
she cooked,

1513
01:15:08,852 --> 01:15:12,029
the presents we gave each other,

1514
01:15:12,072 --> 01:15:14,074
that first Christmas

1515
01:15:14,118 --> 01:15:16,468
there with your mother
in front of our

1516
01:15:16,512 --> 01:15:20,472
ruined tree and no presents.

1517
01:15:21,604 --> 01:15:24,345
It's one of
my favorite memories of all.

1518
01:15:27,087 --> 01:15:28,915
I had your mother.

1519
01:15:28,959 --> 01:15:31,396
I had everything.

1520
01:15:33,616 --> 01:15:35,748
And your mom did so much

1521
01:15:35,792 --> 01:15:38,272
to make Christmas
special for us.

1522
01:15:38,316 --> 01:15:41,449
The baking,
the decorating, the gifts.

1523
01:15:45,802 --> 01:15:50,284
But Christmas isn't about the
way she did things.

1524
01:15:51,634 --> 01:15:53,505
It's about the why.

1525
01:15:55,420 --> 01:15:58,423
She did those things for us
because she loved us.

1526
01:16:01,557 --> 01:16:03,123
We don't have
your mother this year,

1527
01:16:03,167 --> 01:16:05,604
but the one thing we do have

1528
01:16:05,648 --> 01:16:07,650
is the love she gave us.

1529
01:16:09,739 --> 01:16:13,264
And that is something
that you'll keep forever.

1530
01:16:18,965 --> 01:16:21,011
I love you, sweetheart.

1531
01:16:21,054 --> 01:16:23,361
I love you, too, Dad.

1532
01:16:25,493 --> 01:16:26,756
Now get back to work.

1533
01:16:50,954 --> 01:16:53,130
Angie?

1534
01:16:53,173 --> 01:16:54,914
Blair, what are you doing here?

1535
01:16:54,958 --> 01:16:56,350
I could ask you the same thing.

1536
01:16:56,394 --> 01:16:58,396
I thought we were closed today.

1537
01:16:58,439 --> 01:17:02,748
I just wanted to come in
and get ahead on some things.

1538
01:17:02,792 --> 01:17:05,011
And get your mind
off of some others?

1539
01:17:06,012 --> 01:17:08,145
Angie, what happened?

1540
01:17:08,188 --> 01:17:10,669
Things were going so well
with you and David.

1541
01:17:10,713 --> 01:17:14,107
And he's leaving tonight.

1542
01:17:14,151 --> 01:17:16,109
He didn't tell me.

1543
01:17:16,153 --> 01:17:17,937
And I didn't tell him...

1544
01:17:17,981 --> 01:17:20,548
Tell him what?

1545
01:17:22,028 --> 01:17:24,727
It doesn't matter.

1546
01:17:24,770 --> 01:17:27,120
I have something for you.

1547
01:17:30,907 --> 01:17:32,822
- What is this?
- Present.

1548
01:17:32,865 --> 01:17:34,495
I was gonna wait and give it
to you after Christmas

1549
01:17:34,519 --> 01:17:36,956
when we reopened, but...

1550
01:17:38,871 --> 01:17:41,308
New aprons?

1551
01:17:42,005 --> 01:17:45,008
Oh, I'm gonna look good in this.

1552
01:17:46,444 --> 01:17:48,228
And it's so soft.

1553
01:17:49,099 --> 01:17:51,536
Thanks, Ang.

1554
01:17:51,579 --> 01:17:54,582
I still don't see what was
wrong with the old ones, but...

1555
01:17:58,412 --> 01:18:01,764
But maybe you were right.

1556
01:18:01,807 --> 01:18:04,070
Maybe I don't
have to do everything

1557
01:18:04,114 --> 01:18:05,942
exactly the way my mom did.

1558
01:18:05,985 --> 01:18:08,596
Maybe it's okay to let go of
some things.

1559
01:18:08,640 --> 01:18:11,643
As long as I hang on to
the ones that really matter.

1560
01:18:11,687 --> 01:18:14,428
Speaking of
the ones that matter.

1561
01:18:14,472 --> 01:18:17,214
Angie, you really need
to talk to David.

1562
01:18:17,257 --> 01:18:19,172
And why is that?

1563
01:18:19,216 --> 01:18:20,478
Because.

1564
01:18:23,133 --> 01:18:26,440
I don't know what to do with six
dozen sunflowers if you don't.

1565
01:18:28,181 --> 01:18:30,662
- What is this?
- I may have gotten in touch

1566
01:18:30,706 --> 01:18:32,838
with Morgan's Nursery
in North Dakota.

1567
01:18:32,882 --> 01:18:34,361
Pulled a few strings,

1568
01:18:34,405 --> 01:18:36,624
spent a small-to-medium fortune
on shipping.

1569
01:18:36,668 --> 01:18:39,715
And gotten you your sunflowers.

1570
01:18:39,758 --> 01:18:41,064
Blair.

1571
01:18:41,107 --> 01:18:42,674
I just know how much
it meant to you

1572
01:18:42,718 --> 01:18:44,807
and I just wanted to show you

1573
01:18:44,850 --> 01:18:47,113
how much you meant to me.
Okay, well,

1574
01:18:47,157 --> 01:18:50,203
this makes the aprons
look very sad in comparison.

1575
01:18:53,380 --> 01:18:55,600
Well, what are you waiting for?

1576
01:18:55,643 --> 01:18:57,776
Let's call David.

1577
01:19:01,780 --> 01:19:03,347
No.

1578
01:19:03,390 --> 01:19:05,741
What?

1579
01:19:05,784 --> 01:19:09,179
What do you say to one last
decorating adventure?

1580
01:19:22,496 --> 01:19:25,064
Where's Angie?

1581
01:19:25,108 --> 01:19:26,849
I don't know, sweetie.

1582
01:19:26,892 --> 01:19:30,113
Thank you all for coming this
evening for the tree lighting.

1583
01:19:30,156 --> 01:19:32,550
Before we begin,
our winner, Angie Waldron

1584
01:19:32,593 --> 01:19:35,422
would like to say a few words
about her tree.

1585
01:19:35,466 --> 01:19:36,902
Angie.

1586
01:19:40,297 --> 01:19:41,646
Thank you, everyone.

1587
01:19:41,689 --> 01:19:44,170
I uh,
I really appreciate your votes.

1588
01:19:45,693 --> 01:19:48,740
But I'm not so sure
I deserve them.

1589
01:19:53,049 --> 01:19:54,485
I lost my mom last year

1590
01:19:54,528 --> 01:19:56,966
and I wanted to decorate
this tree in her memory.

1591
01:19:57,009 --> 01:19:59,838
Roses were her favorite.

1592
01:19:59,882 --> 01:20:02,623
But I realized
I was missing something.

1593
01:20:02,667 --> 01:20:05,235
I've been so focused on
trying to hold on to her memory

1594
01:20:05,278 --> 01:20:06,497
that I almost lost sight

1595
01:20:06,540 --> 01:20:10,631
on what she loved most
about the season.

1596
01:20:10,675 --> 01:20:12,938
The way it
brings people together,

1597
01:20:12,982 --> 01:20:17,595
families and friends,
communities, strangers.

1598
01:20:18,901 --> 01:20:21,991
So today with the help
of a very special friend,

1599
01:20:22,034 --> 01:20:24,080
I redecorated the tree

1600
01:20:24,123 --> 01:20:26,430
to remember my mom the way

1601
01:20:26,473 --> 01:20:28,606
I think
she'd want to be remembered.

1602
01:20:28,649 --> 01:20:30,434
As somebody who knew Christmas

1603
01:20:30,477 --> 01:20:32,958
isn't about the way
you do things.

1604
01:20:33,916 --> 01:20:35,918
It's about the why.

1605
01:20:35,961 --> 01:20:39,225
Christmas is because of love

1606
01:20:39,269 --> 01:20:42,881
and love brings people together.

1607
01:20:42,925 --> 01:20:45,884
And sometimes it means giving up
what you thought you wanted

1608
01:20:45,928 --> 01:20:48,974
to make room
for something even better.

1609
01:20:49,932 --> 01:20:51,672
This is for you, Mom.

1610
01:21:03,554 --> 01:21:04,923
So I hope this tree
brings you all

1611
01:21:04,947 --> 01:21:07,210
as much joy as it brings me.

1612
01:21:07,253 --> 01:21:09,908
And I hope you remember
that this Christmas season

1613
01:21:09,952 --> 01:21:12,780
isn't just about joy and hope,

1614
01:21:12,824 --> 01:21:14,739
but it's about love.

1615
01:21:14,782 --> 01:21:16,175
Merry Christmas.

1616
01:21:27,360 --> 01:21:28,884
Very beautiful, honey.

1617
01:21:28,927 --> 01:21:31,103
I am so proud of you.

1618
01:21:31,147 --> 01:21:32,888
And I know your mother is, too.

1619
01:21:32,931 --> 01:21:34,890
Thanks, Dad.

1620
01:21:39,546 --> 01:21:42,898
I think real life
is waiting for you.

1621
01:21:55,171 --> 01:21:56,302
Thank you, Angie.

1622
01:21:56,346 --> 01:21:59,001
Mm-hmm. Of course, Gabby.

1623
01:21:59,044 --> 01:22:01,438
That was a nice speech.

1624
01:22:01,481 --> 01:22:05,094
I actually have one more.

1625
01:22:05,137 --> 01:22:07,879
David, for half of my life
you were my best friend.

1626
01:22:07,923 --> 01:22:11,839
You knew me better than anyone
and now you're back in my life.

1627
01:22:11,883 --> 01:22:13,537
And I don't want you to go.

1628
01:22:13,580 --> 01:22:16,061
I want you to stay here in
Greenpine Grove.

1629
01:22:16,105 --> 01:22:17,802
I know you have your life
back in Florida

1630
01:22:17,845 --> 01:22:20,283
and you're heading home soon,
but I...

1631
01:22:21,458 --> 01:22:24,940
Something tells me
we're already home.

1632
01:22:24,983 --> 01:22:26,898
What about your job?

1633
01:22:26,942 --> 01:22:28,856
I'll figure something out.

1634
01:22:28,900 --> 01:22:30,728
Keep working remotely.

1635
01:22:30,771 --> 01:22:32,643
Maybe you can hire me
at the nursery.

1636
01:22:34,688 --> 01:22:36,995
It doesn't matter where I am,
Angie.

1637
01:22:37,039 --> 01:22:39,955
Wherever it is, I just want to
be there with you.

1638
01:23:06,982 --> 01:23:10,289
Flowers.
Everything was beautiful.

1639
01:23:10,333 --> 01:23:13,162
Thank you for the flowers,
Angie.

1640
01:23:14,859 --> 01:23:17,296
Great.
