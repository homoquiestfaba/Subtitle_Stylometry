1
00:00:08,842 --> 00:00:16,349
(Waves crash amidst a deep wind)

2
00:01:10,528 --> 00:01:18,036
(A haunting whisper and
the sounds of distant war)

3
00:01:50,318 --> 00:01:57,826
(A ghostly wind intensifies)

4
00:02:07,252 --> 00:02:14,467
(The wind stops abruptly)

5
00:02:26,437 --> 00:02:33,653
(The night is busy with cicadas)

6
00:02:46,374 --> 00:02:53,590
(An animal howl echos in the distance)

7
00:02:56,718 --> 00:03:03,933
(Thunder crashes; A woman screams)

8
00:03:06,519 --> 00:03:13,151
(The animal howls continue)

9
00:03:22,368 --> 00:03:28,124
(A radio plays warbled music)

10
00:03:28,207 --> 00:03:35,423
(The teapot boils)

11
00:03:48,519 --> 00:03:55,735
(The night is quiet again,
aside from the cicadas)

12
00:04:13,044 --> 00:04:20,259
(The music has stopped; Static remains)

13
00:04:59,674 --> 00:05:06,889
(A crash of thunder amidst heavy rain)

14
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:15,106
Horses have started dying around here.

15
00:05:15,189 --> 00:05:17,108
The air's thick with it.

16
00:05:25,283 --> 00:05:27,577
They're getting slaughtered on the beach.

17
00:05:28,953 --> 00:05:32,165
Damn wind's blowing it in from the south.

18
00:05:33,124 --> 00:05:37,086
(The thunderstorm continues)

19
00:05:45,219 --> 00:05:49,515
(A clock chimes as music begins)

20
00:06:27,845 --> 00:06:35,061
(The music continues)

21
00:08:58,704 --> 00:09:05,920
(Heavy breathing)

22
00:09:35,491 --> 00:09:38,494
(A rooster crows)

23
00:09:39,078 --> 00:09:46,294
(Another cicada filled night)

24
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:07,750
(Water gurgles from the stream)

25
00:11:17,635 --> 00:11:19,387
We'd come up from whittle,

26
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:21,305
on our way to the station in rye.

27
00:11:23,516 --> 00:11:26,852
He was a decent man, but...

28
00:11:28,896 --> 00:11:30,689
He had debts to pay.

29
00:11:31,816 --> 00:11:33,985
A train to nowhere...

30
00:11:34,068 --> 00:11:35,820
A new town,

31
00:11:35,903 --> 00:11:38,823
forgotten even by god,

32
00:11:38,906 --> 00:11:41,367
was our only hope for a better life.

33
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:46,914
The winds blew through.

34
00:11:46,997 --> 00:11:48,958
We got separated in the darkness.

35
00:11:51,710 --> 00:11:53,171
When I found him,

36
00:11:53,254 --> 00:11:55,423
he had been beaten and trampled.

37
00:11:58,717 --> 00:12:00,678
His bones were broken.

38
00:12:00,761 --> 00:12:02,471
His skull was crushed.

39
00:12:03,681 --> 00:12:07,143
I cried for help, but no one came.

40
00:12:10,521 --> 00:12:12,857
It's been three nights.

41
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:14,900
His body already smells.

42
00:12:20,656 --> 00:12:23,576
An angel of death roams this place.

43
00:12:32,251 --> 00:12:33,711
If you need somewhere to stay,

44
00:12:33,794 --> 00:12:35,713
our cabin is just up the road.

45
00:12:37,006 --> 00:12:39,092
We can't go to rye tomorrow, but

46
00:12:39,175 --> 00:12:41,677
Jonathan and I can go
with you the next day.

47
00:12:42,928 --> 00:12:45,556
You won't be a burden to us.

48
00:13:11,665 --> 00:13:16,337
(Warbled voices from the radio)

49
00:13:33,938 --> 00:13:36,983
I met Juliette at the stream.

50
00:13:37,066 --> 00:13:37,984
I thought we could help her

51
00:13:38,067 --> 00:13:40,027
catch a train in town.

52
00:13:42,947 --> 00:13:46,075
Yeah, I've been needing to get to town.

53
00:13:46,158 --> 00:13:48,077
Come in. Come in.

54
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:49,995
God, Johnathan!

55
00:13:51,038 --> 00:13:51,956
Ah, it's...

56
00:13:52,039 --> 00:13:53,499
I have medicine.

57
00:13:53,582 --> 00:13:55,460
Plants, herbs...

58
00:13:55,543 --> 00:13:56,919
They might help.

59
00:13:59,838 --> 00:14:05,678
(Plants mashing)

60
00:14:31,829 --> 00:14:37,668
(Another thunderstorm begins)

61
00:14:44,508 --> 00:14:46,885
How long have you been together?

62
00:14:49,305 --> 00:14:51,140
Oh, about...

63
00:14:51,223 --> 00:14:54,518
Five years. More or less.

64
00:14:56,270 --> 00:14:57,980
Back when a summer garden would still

65
00:14:58,063 --> 00:14:59,898
bring in a hundred dollars.

66
00:15:02,651 --> 00:15:07,365
She got off at the
station on the last train.

67
00:15:07,448 --> 00:15:09,534
Two suitcases:

68
00:15:09,617 --> 00:15:11,619
One, clothes.

69
00:15:13,162 --> 00:15:15,373
The other one full of books,

70
00:15:15,456 --> 00:15:17,291
heavy as a sack of bricks.

71
00:15:20,878 --> 00:15:22,964
Said she had an aunt

72
00:15:23,047 --> 00:15:25,257
in town, staying at the inn.

73
00:15:26,884 --> 00:15:29,136
Only I guess nobody told her there

74
00:15:29,219 --> 00:15:31,972
weren't no inn in rye at the time.

75
00:15:34,266 --> 00:15:36,852
The weather was turning,

76
00:15:36,935 --> 00:15:39,730
so I offered her a place to stay and...

77
00:15:39,813 --> 00:15:42,149
She accepted.

78
00:15:42,232 --> 00:15:44,610
Much to my surprise.

79
00:15:44,693 --> 00:15:46,654
I said, you gotta'

80
00:15:46,737 --> 00:15:48,072
choose which bag to bring though

81
00:15:48,155 --> 00:15:50,699
'cus the cart could only hold one.

82
00:15:52,242 --> 00:15:55,496
Now, she was mighty torn about this...

83
00:15:55,579 --> 00:15:57,299
But like anybody with
good sense in her head

84
00:15:57,331 --> 00:15:59,208
she...

85
00:15:59,291 --> 00:16:01,502
She left the books at the station.

86
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:04,547
And we hadn't...

87
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:07,717
Barely got home when it started raining.

88
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:10,595
Damn, if that wasn't something.

89
00:16:10,678 --> 00:16:11,970
Awful.

90
00:16:13,722 --> 00:16:15,850
I took her back the next day to the

91
00:16:15,933 --> 00:16:17,810
station to fetch those books.

92
00:16:20,646 --> 00:16:22,231
Maybe catch a train home.

93
00:16:24,566 --> 00:16:27,945
But there weren't a dry page left.

94
00:16:28,028 --> 00:16:30,155
And she didn't have a dollar to her name.

95
00:16:34,743 --> 00:16:36,996
I reckon that's when we fell in love.

96
00:16:37,079 --> 00:16:38,539
Right then and there.

97
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:46,630
(The clock chimes; Music begins again)

98
00:16:50,926 --> 00:16:52,761
Do you dance, Juliette?

99
00:16:56,849 --> 00:17:00,644
(Edm music begins)

100
00:18:32,277 --> 00:18:36,073
(Edm music continues)

101
00:20:56,421 --> 00:21:00,217
(The music fades)

102
00:21:13,146 --> 00:21:15,440
It's the best we can do.

103
00:21:40,090 --> 00:21:42,884
(A rooster crows)

104
00:21:43,885 --> 00:21:51,101
(Another cicada filled night)

105
00:22:33,894 --> 00:22:39,900
(Water gurgles from the stream)

106
00:22:41,610 --> 00:22:45,489
Last night I dreamt his
grave had filled with bees.

107
00:22:45,572 --> 00:22:48,742
They built their hives
in the cracks of his skull.

108
00:22:48,825 --> 00:22:51,120
Honey flowed into the stream,

109
00:22:51,203 --> 00:22:53,288
poisoned the water,

110
00:22:53,371 --> 00:22:55,374
made it sour.

111
00:22:55,457 --> 00:22:57,126
You could hear the buzzing for miles,

112
00:22:57,209 --> 00:22:59,169
as far as the next town.

113
00:23:01,004 --> 00:23:02,506
A man told me,

114
00:23:02,589 --> 00:23:05,134
everywhere we stand is a pool of blood

115
00:23:05,217 --> 00:23:06,760
crying out to god,

116
00:23:06,843 --> 00:23:08,804
what water can clean us now?

117
00:23:11,348 --> 00:23:12,808
As I turned a corner...

118
00:23:12,891 --> 00:23:14,726
The streets were filled with waste.

119
00:23:15,977 --> 00:23:18,147
There was a light behind the building.

120
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:20,065
Somehow, I knew Richard
was alive over there,

121
00:23:20,148 --> 00:23:22,192
but that if I went behind the building,

122
00:23:22,275 --> 00:23:23,693
I would die.

123
00:23:25,529 --> 00:23:28,866
I don't know if it was a
dream or some bad omen.

124
00:23:28,949 --> 00:23:31,410
Maybe he is alive out there.

125
00:23:31,493 --> 00:23:33,120
Happy.

126
00:23:33,203 --> 00:23:36,040
Surrounded by light.

127
00:23:36,123 --> 00:23:37,999
That's all I can hope for.

128
00:23:42,212 --> 00:23:44,798
The dreams stop after awhile.

129
00:23:48,677 --> 00:23:50,971
My brother fought in the war.

130
00:23:53,098 --> 00:23:55,601
He was my best friend.

131
00:23:55,684 --> 00:23:58,562
My father's favorite.

132
00:23:58,645 --> 00:24:01,648
He wrote home once a week,

133
00:24:01,731 --> 00:24:05,444
when we are to make an
advance, no one knows.

134
00:24:05,527 --> 00:24:08,405
But may the god of
battles make it effectual,

135
00:24:08,488 --> 00:24:11,366
and the last.

136
00:24:11,449 --> 00:24:14,286
I hope to see you in the
course of two months;

137
00:24:14,369 --> 00:24:17,247
maybe sooner;

138
00:24:17,330 --> 00:24:20,125
maybe hardly so soon.

139
00:24:22,836 --> 00:24:26,298
One day the letters just stopped.

140
00:24:26,381 --> 00:24:29,050
We never heard from him again.

141
00:24:31,303 --> 00:24:34,014
I don't know where he's buried,

142
00:24:34,097 --> 00:24:36,224
or if he even was.

143
00:24:39,269 --> 00:24:41,605
My father grieved with the bottle.

144
00:24:44,024 --> 00:24:46,359
And I read books.

145
00:24:47,611 --> 00:24:50,197
I stayed in that house for years,

146
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:53,534
listening to every breath of wind,

147
00:24:53,617 --> 00:24:54,868
every crunch of leaves,

148
00:24:54,951 --> 00:24:58,705
every knock at the door;

149
00:24:58,788 --> 00:25:01,917
hoping he'd show up someday.

150
00:25:07,214 --> 00:25:09,382
I had terrible nightmares.

151
00:25:10,675 --> 00:25:12,469
I saw him...

152
00:25:12,552 --> 00:25:14,721
Ripped apart by canons;

153
00:25:14,804 --> 00:25:17,641
torn with bayonets.

154
00:25:17,724 --> 00:25:20,435
His guts spilled on empty fields.

155
00:25:22,270 --> 00:25:24,022
His eyes were always...

156
00:25:24,105 --> 00:25:27,109
Cold, but they stared right at me.

157
00:25:27,192 --> 00:25:29,861
Like he was calling out for help.

158
00:25:32,113 --> 00:25:35,284
Every night, I prayed
that his spirit would rest,

159
00:25:35,367 --> 00:25:37,202
but the dreams went on.

160
00:25:40,163 --> 00:25:46,879
Then one day I heard a
great trumpet in the sky.

161
00:25:46,962 --> 00:25:51,300
I don't even know if I was awake or asleep,

162
00:25:51,383 --> 00:25:53,719
but it sounded like a...

163
00:25:53,802 --> 00:25:57,013
Great voice telling me to be at peace.

164
00:25:59,349 --> 00:26:04,354
I felt a dark cloud lift off me and...

165
00:26:04,437 --> 00:26:06,648
I haven't dreamt of him since.

166
00:26:18,618 --> 00:26:24,708
(A radio plays warbled music)

167
00:26:27,085 --> 00:26:34,301
(The teapot boils)

168
00:27:21,556 --> 00:27:27,562
(Water gurgles from the stream)

169
00:27:36,237 --> 00:27:39,783
Your water's sweet, like honey.

170
00:27:42,535 --> 00:27:44,621
That's because the land is strong.

171
00:27:46,373 --> 00:27:50,377
They say it's the first plot
god pulled from the sea,

172
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:52,587
and the last he'll drag back.

173
00:27:54,255 --> 00:27:57,092
It's been in Jonathan's
family for a thousand years.

174
00:28:01,596 --> 00:28:03,681
Are you happy here, Mary?

175
00:28:07,894 --> 00:28:09,771
Come to the coast with me.

176
00:28:09,854 --> 00:28:11,356
Get away from this place.

177
00:28:14,901 --> 00:28:17,612
I can't, Juliette.

178
00:28:26,246 --> 00:28:30,166
(A clock chimes as music begins)

179
00:28:35,713 --> 00:28:40,594
While you live...

180
00:28:40,677 --> 00:28:43,513
Shine.

181
00:28:46,057 --> 00:28:53,523
Have no grief at all.

182
00:28:58,611 --> 00:29:06,611
Life exists for a short while...

183
00:29:08,538 --> 00:29:15,044
And time demands its toll.

184
00:29:17,839 --> 00:29:21,050
(The music turns to static)

185
00:29:24,554 --> 00:29:28,850
(The kettle starts to scream)

186
00:29:38,067 --> 00:29:42,363
(Unintelligible whispering)

187
00:29:55,793 --> 00:30:00,089
(The whispering stops)

188
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:04,594
(The kettle quiets down)

189
00:30:10,183 --> 00:30:13,228
(The radio plays static)

190
00:30:13,311 --> 00:30:17,607
(A clap of thunder; Gentle rain)

191
00:30:27,033 --> 00:30:29,744
Started coming around a couple years ago.

192
00:30:31,996 --> 00:30:34,165
Two or three times a week.

193
00:30:37,585 --> 00:30:38,646
He ain't gonna' be satisfied

194
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:40,839
'till he caves this place in.

195
00:30:40,922 --> 00:30:42,715
I heard Richard's voice.

196
00:30:43,925 --> 00:30:46,344
It's different for everyone;

197
00:30:46,427 --> 00:30:49,264
always someone we've lost...

198
00:30:49,347 --> 00:30:50,599
My brother.

199
00:30:50,682 --> 00:30:52,642
My first wife.

200
00:30:54,602 --> 00:30:56,646
But it's not him, Juliette.

201
00:31:01,818 --> 00:31:05,780
Well, let's have a drink.

202
00:31:34,851 --> 00:31:38,605
Here's to another day...

203
00:31:40,815 --> 00:31:43,276
Another night rather.

204
00:31:46,112 --> 00:31:48,406
May we all live long lives,

205
00:31:50,408 --> 00:31:52,785
and die in the comfort of our homes.

206
00:31:55,371 --> 00:31:59,208
Asleep and free of pain.

207
00:32:20,355 --> 00:32:24,651
(The night is quiet and calm)

208
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:43,086
Have you gotten any sleep?

209
00:32:43,169 --> 00:32:45,880
Must be the coffee.

210
00:32:47,256 --> 00:32:49,676
I was going to give
this to you at the station.

211
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:54,430
It's not finished yet.

212
00:33:08,319 --> 00:33:10,405
You should get some rest.

213
00:33:10,488 --> 00:33:12,532
It's a long walk tomorrow.

214
00:33:40,601 --> 00:33:44,897
(Heavy, distorted wind)

215
00:34:31,611 --> 00:34:35,907
(Distorted music plays)

216
00:34:46,501 --> 00:34:50,797
(The music cuts in and out)

217
00:34:58,721 --> 00:35:03,017
(Static plays)

218
00:35:43,140 --> 00:35:47,436
(Ghostly music plays)

219
00:36:46,329 --> 00:36:50,625
(A calm night of crickets)

220
00:37:45,137 --> 00:37:49,433
(Water gurgles from the stream)

221
00:39:00,504 --> 00:39:04,800
(A huge burst of wind)

222
00:39:13,726 --> 00:39:18,022
(Animals howl)

223
00:39:42,213 --> 00:39:46,509
(Static plays)

224
00:41:06,380 --> 00:41:10,676
(A calm, quiet, night)

225
00:41:22,730 --> 00:41:24,357
Have you seen Juliette?

226
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:25,816
She isn't here?

227
00:41:28,611 --> 00:41:31,531
Must've gone on without us then.

228
00:41:31,614 --> 00:41:33,157
Sure is a shame.

229
00:41:35,409 --> 00:41:38,078
Reckon I'll go into town anyway though.

230
00:41:39,205 --> 00:41:41,665
I need to get some real
medicine for this hand.

231
00:42:14,823 --> 00:42:17,910
Maybe she's at the stream.

232
00:42:19,411 --> 00:42:22,373
When are you going to town?

233
00:42:22,456 --> 00:42:24,959
I guess whenever you get back, dear.

234
00:42:36,262 --> 00:42:40,557
(Water gurgles from the stream)

235
00:43:23,642 --> 00:43:25,436
(A clap of thunder)

236
00:43:32,818 --> 00:43:35,780
A deer must've died upstream.

237
00:43:35,863 --> 00:43:38,449
Ought to clear out in a couple of days.

238
00:43:38,532 --> 00:43:40,493
We'll ask some of the
folks in town how theirs is;

239
00:43:40,576 --> 00:43:43,245
hopefully it isn't something more serious.

240
00:43:45,039 --> 00:43:47,541
I'm not going to town.

241
00:43:49,668 --> 00:43:54,089
I'm going to wait here in
case Juliette comes back.

242
00:43:56,467 --> 00:43:59,512
I doubt she'll come back here.

243
00:43:59,595 --> 00:44:01,513
Alright. Suit yourself.

244
00:44:05,684 --> 00:44:08,229
But, hey, if you...

245
00:44:08,312 --> 00:44:10,356
Hear a woman screaming in the woods,

246
00:44:10,439 --> 00:44:11,982
you go the other way.

247
00:44:14,318 --> 00:44:18,197
The mountain lions,
darling. The mountain lions.

248
00:44:18,280 --> 00:44:20,074
I'll be back in a couple hours.

249
00:44:43,430 --> 00:44:47,518
(Warbled radio dialogue
amidst a thunderstorm)

250
00:45:09,331 --> 00:45:13,627
(The rain continues)

251
00:45:21,427 --> 00:45:23,053
Juliette?

252
00:45:40,696 --> 00:45:43,782
Doc. Said two a day for pain.

253
00:45:45,451 --> 00:45:47,036
Nothin' much he could do with the hand;

254
00:45:47,119 --> 00:45:49,288
short of amputating,

255
00:45:49,371 --> 00:45:53,167
he thinks it'll heal up if
I don't work it too hard.

256
00:45:53,250 --> 00:45:55,752
You may have to chop
wood for the rest of the year.

257
00:45:59,756 --> 00:46:01,425
Listen,

258
00:46:01,508 --> 00:46:03,344
Mary, I asked the conductor

259
00:46:03,427 --> 00:46:05,638
if a woman matching Juliette's description

260
00:46:05,721 --> 00:46:07,264
got on board tonight.

261
00:46:07,347 --> 00:46:08,682
You know what he said?

262
00:46:10,309 --> 00:46:11,602
A woman looking just like her

263
00:46:11,685 --> 00:46:13,687
got on the first train out this evening.

264
00:46:17,774 --> 00:46:20,068
You didn't really ask him.

265
00:46:22,362 --> 00:46:24,240
I swear I did, Mary.

266
00:46:24,323 --> 00:46:25,449
Just for you.

267
00:46:28,327 --> 00:46:29,328
I just don't understand

268
00:46:29,411 --> 00:46:31,455
why she would leave in such a hurry.

269
00:46:32,956 --> 00:46:36,043
You know, people got
their reasons, I suppose.

270
00:46:39,338 --> 00:46:43,634
(Soft music plays)

271
00:46:47,638 --> 00:46:50,015
Why do you have to make it a big deal?

272
00:46:50,098 --> 00:46:52,518
I don't want to.

273
00:46:54,144 --> 00:46:58,941
Just sing one song. I'll be up in a minute.

274
00:47:43,443 --> 00:47:46,530
I need to lie down.

275
00:48:06,466 --> 00:48:10,762
(Soft music continues)

276
00:49:33,387 --> 00:49:37,683
(A night filled with cicadas)

277
00:50:16,012 --> 00:50:20,308
(Warbled music plays)

278
00:50:31,319 --> 00:50:35,824
(The clock chimes; Music becomes static)

279
00:50:35,907 --> 00:50:38,910
(The kettle boils; Increasing in intensity)

280
00:50:50,547 --> 00:50:54,843
(The static stops)

281
00:51:01,224 --> 00:51:05,520
(Unintelligible whispering)

282
00:51:15,614 --> 00:51:17,824
(A ghostly breath)

283
00:51:26,124 --> 00:51:30,420
(Distant sounds of war)

284
00:52:02,118 --> 00:52:06,414
(Water gurgles from the stream)

285
00:52:15,465 --> 00:52:19,386
Mary!

286
00:52:34,818 --> 00:52:37,028
Juliette!

287
00:52:41,283 --> 00:52:43,452
Mary!

288
00:52:43,535 --> 00:52:45,495
Juliette!

289
00:52:49,374 --> 00:52:50,750
Mary!

290
00:52:53,295 --> 00:52:57,591
(War sounds continue)

291
00:53:01,261 --> 00:53:02,387
(A bird caws)

292
00:53:12,772 --> 00:53:17,193
Mary?

293
00:53:29,331 --> 00:53:32,542
Juliette?

294
00:53:48,058 --> 00:53:49,685
I hid there, where there was no man.

295
00:53:49,768 --> 00:53:51,228
People were taken suddenly;

296
00:53:51,311 --> 00:53:52,938
two by two, they were taken!

297
00:53:53,021 --> 00:53:55,148
This whole land is a desolation!

298
00:53:55,231 --> 00:53:57,317
The fields were wilderness.

299
00:53:57,400 --> 00:53:59,361
And the cities had all broken down.

300
00:53:59,444 --> 00:54:01,280
There hasn't been a city in years.

301
00:54:01,363 --> 00:54:03,574
I have no home to turn back to!

302
00:54:03,657 --> 00:54:05,534
Though the righteous may die,

303
00:54:05,617 --> 00:54:06,451
they shall live forever,

304
00:54:06,534 --> 00:54:09,955
but the suffering of the
wicked shall have no end!

305
00:54:10,038 --> 00:54:12,374
But beyond the sea is a city of lights.

306
00:54:12,457 --> 00:54:13,834
The last one!

307
00:54:13,917 --> 00:54:16,086
If we beg at the gates,
they might let us in!

308
00:54:16,169 --> 00:54:17,379
Shh... Juliette.

309
00:54:17,462 --> 00:54:19,089
Come to the coast with me, Mary, please!

310
00:54:19,172 --> 00:54:20,299
You need to rest!

311
00:54:20,382 --> 00:54:21,717
I can't go there alone!

312
00:54:21,800 --> 00:54:23,719
I can't go there alone, Mary!

313
00:54:23,802 --> 00:54:26,597
It's okay! It's okay! I'll go with you.

314
00:54:26,680 --> 00:54:28,974
Okay? I'll go with you, Juliette.

315
00:54:29,057 --> 00:54:33,270
(A loud trumpet from the sky)

316
00:54:33,353 --> 00:54:37,649
(Wind howls)

317
00:55:03,049 --> 00:55:07,512
(A woman screams; Angelic music begins)

318
00:55:07,595 --> 00:55:09,431
We have to leave, Juliette!

319
00:55:09,514 --> 00:55:11,850
You were right, Mary,
I do feel different now.

320
00:55:11,933 --> 00:55:16,229
(Early morning birds chirp)

321
00:55:27,115 --> 00:55:31,411
(Sounds of war and angelic music continue)

322
00:55:36,541 --> 00:55:38,126
We're almost there!

323
00:55:42,839 --> 00:55:45,133
(Sea waves crash)

324
00:55:46,217 --> 00:55:47,635
Look, Juliette!

325
00:55:49,554 --> 00:55:51,931
It's beautiful!

326
00:55:53,224 --> 00:55:56,770
I can't see Mary! I can't see!

327
00:55:56,853 --> 00:56:03,526
(The screech of a warplane; An explosion)

328
00:56:08,907 --> 00:56:13,203
(Animals howl)

329
00:56:45,860 --> 00:56:51,867
(Waves crash amidst a deep wind)

330
00:56:51,950 --> 00:56:57,539
(Orchestral music plays)

331
00:58:59,869 --> 00:59:05,458
(The waves and music fade out)
