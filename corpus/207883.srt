1
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,753
Now, I want you to try and tell us
everything that happened.

2
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:27,593
Anything you can remember.

3
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:33,350
I can't, I can't remember.

4
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:39,478
We need your help so we can
find the other children.

5
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:46,989
A house.

6
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:53,158
- What?
- They took us to a house.

7
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:01,197
- Who?
- I don't know. People.

8
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:06,830
Do you think the other children
are still there?

9
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:14,199
Do you think they've been hurt?

10
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:22,109
Yes.

11
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:28,557
You're doing just fine.
We're going to find them.

12
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:37,272
But we need you to tell us more.
You've got to try and remember.

13
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:44,629
I can't, I can't remember anything.

14
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:08,191
Shit!

15
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:32,199
- Drink it.
- But...

16
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:34,556
No complaints. Drink.

17
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:20,198
- Did you get 'em?
- Get what?

18
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:21,395
The pencils.

19
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:24,316
Yeah.

20
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:28,028
Has he had breakfast?

21
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:31,198
- We're on it. How did it go?
- I'm bushed.

22
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:33,836
I think it's going to take me a while
to get used to it,

23
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,638
and on top of that,
night shifts.

24
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:38,558
Don't worry,
you're just starting.

25
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:41,792
Anyhow I'm going to my father
about getting your shift changed.

26
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:42,995
We'll see.

27
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:45,668
Do you know
where the toaster is?

28
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:48,550
I have no idea.

29
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:52,754
We still have tons
of boxes left to open.

30
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:57,875
Unless you give me a hand,
I give up.

31
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:27,030
Hey, big guy.

32
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:28,156
Hi.

33
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:33,956
- Today's your first day, isn't it?
- Yeah.

34
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:36,152
- You nervous?
- A little.

35
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:39,359
You'll see that you'll like it.
You'll make lots of friends soon.

36
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:40,316
Come on, Paul.

37
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,233
You're gonna be late,
come on.

38
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:44,396
Bye.

39
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:49,553
It's about time.

40
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:52,117
I was just about to get you up.

41
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:55,033
We've got to do.

42
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:56,794
It's too early.

43
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:59,073
And I have swim practice.

44
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:01,553
That's not for two hours.

45
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:03,068
And travel.

46
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:06,989
This is the sticks,
I have to take the bus everywhere.

47
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:10,513
I'm not waiting any longer for this
to start looking like a real house.

48
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:12,352
We've been here almost three weeks,

49
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:16,390
and with the notable
exception of myself,

50
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:17,959
one has unpacked one single box.

51
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:21,074
And don't forget, you promised you
were going to paint your room.

52
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:27,074
Mom, I don't...
I don't know if I'm staying.

53
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,439
I thought we discussed this, Reggie.

54
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:35,677
You know how your father
and I feel.

55
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:36,830
When have you
ever listened to me?

56
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:39,674
I just want to finish
school in the States with my friends.

57
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:41,953
Is that so abnormal?

58
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,479
- Hi.
- Hi.

59
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,319
What are you doing here?

60
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:20,829
You're crazy.

61
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:22,799
I'm not doing anything wrong.

62
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:26,313
I'm just here to pick up
my American friend.

63
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:30,080
Well, you got here too late
'cause I got to go.

64
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:32,758
Just tell me if you're gonna stay.

65
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:34,436
I'm not.

66
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:37,117
- Come on, you got to go.
- Why not?

67
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:40,313
Go, please.

68
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:42,555
They saw you.

69
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:47,476
- We'll talk about it later.
- Promise?

70
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:49,629
I promise.

71
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:01,190
I'm warning you,

72
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:04,079
it's not going to be easy for your
family to live in another country.

73
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:05,395
Especially for the kids.

74
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:08,953
Oh, I know. It's a big move.
I'm sure hoping they'll get used to it.

75
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:11,872
It's a great place.

76
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:13,395
Think so?

77
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,353
It needs work.

78
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:16,632
Yeah, That's true.

79
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:18,472
A hammer and nails and a bit
of paint, you'll see.

80
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:21,196
Plus I got one month
before semester starts.

81
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:23,235
Good luck.

82
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:28,873
Did you meet?

83
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:31,596
- No. Hi.
- How ya doing?

84
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:33,831
I was just saying,
it's like a dream come true.

85
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:35,832
You know what? He's lying.

86
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:54,633
You don't want to play anymore?

87
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:02,714
Oh, thanks.

88
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:07,434
Everybody seems to be having
a good time, right?

89
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:14,475
Paul reminds me of Mark
when he was that age.

90
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:16,070
Before...

91
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:18,669
he left.

92
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,789
Now you'll have your grandchildren
all to yourself

93
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:25,197
and you're gonna get sick of them.

94
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:26,989
Yes.

95
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:29,638
It must be strange for them.

96
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:32,999
Poor Paul.

97
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:40,434
He'll end up crazy about you.
You'll see.

98
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:45,518
I'm gonna get jealous.

99
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:52,914
It's good to see you, dad.

100
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:24,636
That's it. It's over.

101
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:27,550
Finally.
I thought it would never end.

102
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:29,713
Way to close a party.

103
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:15,753
Not again.

104
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:16,233
...experts suggest to be cautious.
Never look directly at the sun,

105
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:18,198
nor the optlcal device.

106
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:23,118
So take care, but make sure not to miss
it, Don't forget it's a unique event,

107
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:24,708
A very special eclipse

108
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:29,272
that takes place only every 40 years
and there are just 5 days to go.

109
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:39,799
- You lived here with grandpa?
- Yeah, when I was your age.

110
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:42,158
That's when you left for the States?

111
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:45,198
Why did you have to?

112
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:47,710
Well, your grandparents decided
to split up and...

113
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:50,511
I didn't have a choice
I had to go.

114
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,194
With your mom?

115
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:54,149
That's right.

116
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:02,319
Are you and mom going

117
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:04,312
- To split up?
- No.

118
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:07,590
Only families that don't get
along split up.

119
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:09,872
We get along,
don't we?

120
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:11,590
Yeah.

121
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:27,877
It's the second day and I bet
I'm the only one late.

122
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:29,509
Don't worry. You'll make it.

123
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:33,838
'We're like the lonely wildebeest

124
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:38,079
bleating his plaintive poetry
to the infinite herd."

125
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:40,318
Hey dad, do you even know
what a wildebeest is?

126
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:41,436
Sure it's...

127
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:44,711
It's like a cow.

128
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:47,273
And what's your cow saying?

129
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:49,790
"Get your ass

130
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:53,592
out of my face."

131
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:58,391
"Get your ass

132
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:01,154
out of my face."

133
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:10,591
Dad look, it worked.

134
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:22,556
Dad?

135
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:51,116
Hey, shithead,
what are you doing? Move it!

136
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:52,672
Fuck!

137
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:01,596
Help me!

138
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:03,755
Help me!

139
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:05,310
Please!

140
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:42,717
- When was his last attack?
- More than ten years ago.

141
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:46,356
Haughtlngton is unpredictable,
but it doesn't have to be serious.

142
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:49,314
As quickly as it has come,
it can go.

143
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:52,349
I don't know.

144
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:55,596
I'm going to give him Haloperidol.

145
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:59,868
But if he does have an attack,
you know about the risk of choking.

146
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:03,278
Just keep a close eye on him.

147
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:05,837
This couldn't come
at a worse time.

148
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:09,154
Don't worry. Everything will be fine.

149
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:10,355
Trust me.

150
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:37,989
Dad.

151
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:40,954
I'm okay, sweetie.
Nothing's happened.

152
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:43,273
Come on, let's go inside.

153
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:48,552
We've still got a lot
of work ahead of us.

154
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:51,635
This is going to be the best house
in the whole world.

155
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:54,036
Mom?

156
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:56,955
What happened?

157
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:59,111
Your father had a small attack,

158
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,479
but it's nothing,
don't worry.

159
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:03,632
I've been talking
to your grandfather.

160
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:05,233
He's got to go back on medication
for a while and that's all.

161
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:06,151
Mom.

162
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:08,669
It's starting again.

163
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:10,668
Nothing is starting again.

164
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:14,037
This is an isolated incident.
Don't blow it out of proportion.

165
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:16,233
You remember what happened.

166
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:18,278
You know exactly what this is.

167
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:20,108
And just now.

168
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:22,873
Just now what?

169
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:25,310
We're completely isolated.
What if something were to happen?

170
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:27,830
We're ten minutes away from
downtown and I already told you,

171
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:29,069
nothing's going to happen.

172
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:31,238
- Mom.
- What?

173
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:33,712
If you don't like this house
or your family,

174
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:35,429
then get your things and go.

175
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:38,190
Isn't that what you wanted, to go?

176
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:39,875
Well, go on then!

177
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:41,959
I think we'll survive.

178
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:50,833
Since the beginning of time,

179
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:53,230
people considered this phenomenon
in different ways.

180
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:55,471
But how do eclipses exactly work?

181
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:57,678
- Feeling better?
- No.

182
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:02,237
Come on, I fight
with my Mom all the time.

183
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:03,950
It's normal.

184
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:07,109
No it's not.

185
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:10,518
She's never been this cruel before.

186
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:18,632
I bet she didn't even notice.

187
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:23,358
- Sometimes people say things that...
- I don't care.

188
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:27,474
I'm not comfortable.

189
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:31,191
I don't feel happy in that house.

190
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:17,758
- Hey there, Tiger.
- Hi.

191
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:19,116
What are you doing?

192
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:20,596
Drawing.

193
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:34,518
You don't play with this anymore.

194
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:37,199
You used to like it.

195
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:39,595
Are you going to die?

196
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:44,635
No.

197
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:51,511
Listen buddy, what happened
is that your dad...

198
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:54,713
I got a little too tense

199
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:55,949
this morning.

200
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:57,879
Forget about it.

201
00:18:58,640 --> 00:18:59,629
You're not going to let

202
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:01,313
that worry you, are you?

203
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:07,915
Come on,

204
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:09,275
time for bed.

205
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:26,595
Dad,

206
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:28,876
don't.

207
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:30,630
Come on,

208
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:31,911
lights out.

209
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:54,870
- You okay?
- Yeah.

210
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:22,109
What are you doing up?

211
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:26,199
I couldn't sleep.

212
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:29,150
Dad said I couldn't leave
a light on.

213
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:32,438
- Since when are you afraid of the dark?
- I'm not.

214
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:33,271
So?

215
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:35,916
It's different here the dark.

216
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:37,715
What do you mean?

217
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:39,673
It eats my pencils.

218
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:44,879
Come on, I'll tell you what, how'bout
we make a deal? I'll lie down with you

219
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:47,076
- Until you fall asleep.
- Promise?

220
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:48,436
Of course.

221
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:50,349
Just give me a minute.

222
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:51,915
Okay.

223
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:41,031
- I can't find anything wrong.
- There's definitely something wrong.

224
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:42,919
Maybe you should check again.

225
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:44,275
I don't know what it could be.

226
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:46,398
Look, I'll check the sockets.

227
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:58,509
Where's my drawing pad?
I left it here last night.

228
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:02,153
- These are kind of wierd drawings.
- They're not wierd.

229
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:03,993
They're just drawings.

230
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:07,430
Yeah, but you keep on doing
the same thing.

231
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:09,477
They're not the same.
They're different.

232
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,274
They look the same to me.

233
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:14,833
That's because they're all children.

234
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:17,393
But they're different children.

235
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:21,596
Paul.

236
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,274
What's this?
Did you hurt yourself?

237
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:25,955
I don't know.

238
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:27,628
Has mom seen it?

239
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:30,475
Yeah. She says I probably did it
in my sleep.

240
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:32,799
When it was dark.

241
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:38,195
I'm going.

242
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:42,512
If you go outside,
don't go near the road. Okay?

243
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:44,309
Okay.

244
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:53,594
What are you doing here?

245
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:58,030
I need to use up the last few frames
on this roll and you will be my model.

246
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:01,793
I like you as a photographer, but I
think I like you better as a painter.

247
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,719
Oh, Dad, this is Carlos.

248
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:08,952
- Hi.
- Hi. Nice to meet you.

249
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,638
Do you know anything
about electricity?

250
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:13,516
No.

251
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:15,350
Come on.

252
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:31,793
It doesn't look like mold,

253
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:34,469
it's more like... rust.

254
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:36,355
I don't understand.

255
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:39,355
They painted the whole house
before we moved in.

256
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:41,830
Trust me, baby,

257
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,353
this is going to look great.

258
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:45,916
It better.

259
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:49,516
And I'm gonna go get
some paint thinner, just in case.

260
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:53,837
If you want,
phone the electric company.

261
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:55,559
The hell with that, there's
something here that doesn't work.

262
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:59,191
We've been here for three weeks now,
and every day the lights go out.

263
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:02,393
They flicker, like the voltage dropped.
Do you understand?

264
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:04,838
Look, if I were you,
I'd talk to the neighbors.

265
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:06,433
If it's a supply thing,
they'll have noticed something too.

266
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:08,750
What neighbors?
We don't have neighbors.

267
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:10,109
This is a fucking nightmare.

268
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:12,278
Calm down, okay?
I've done all I can.

269
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:14,556
In other words, fuck you, right?

270
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:16,791
In my own house. And to my face.
Fuck you!

271
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:21,758
Well, you're not getting
a penny from me. Not a goddamn penny.

272
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:25,391
The insurance company will pay me
either way. Tell it to them.

273
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:08,355
Not now.

274
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:10,635
What's wrong?

275
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:14,191
I'm staying.

276
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:18,839
I can't leave now.

277
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,718
I'm not going to ask you why.

278
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:30,514
That's probably a good idea.

279
00:26:58,360 --> 00:27:00,271
What are you doing up?
It's late.

280
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:02,188
I was waiting up for you.

281
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:08,789
I'm bushed.

282
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:13,990
I hope you painted
that room.

283
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:16,239
I need to talk to you.

284
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:18,556
Tomorrow. I'm wrecked.

285
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:22,995
You can't imagine
how busy it's been today.

286
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:26,673
Why can't wejust talk?

287
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:28,873
Theres something I need to tell you.

288
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:33,832
You say not to worry,

289
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:36,357
but Dad is a bundle of nerves.

290
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:39,149
You should have seen the way he blew
up at the electrician this morning.

291
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:41,753
Oh, he's just...

292
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:46,995
- And like, Paul's not well. I mean...
- Paul's okay.

293
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:48,798
Look at the drawings.

294
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:52,040
I mean, does this look like the kind

295
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:54,033
of thing normal kids do? I mean...

296
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:57,950
He's a kid. You should have seen
the ones you used to make. Come on.

297
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:02,030
Don't touch it!

298
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:04,710
Sorry.

299
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:07,916
These old things
can be pretty delicate.

300
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:11,396
What's that?

301
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:15,750
A room. Hidden behind the wall.

302
00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:17,508
How did you know it was there?

303
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:18,988
Paul told me.

304
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:21,674
Hey, check it out.

305
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:26,872
What about hanging it here?

306
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:33,474
Fuck!

307
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:35,430
It works.

308
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:38,032
That's the beauty
of old things,

309
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:40,478
no electricity required.

310
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:43,430
I'll stop it.

311
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:44,876
No.

312
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:54,675
And you, little psychic, how did
you know that room was there?

313
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:57,151
What are you talking about?

314
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:03,269
- Dad said you told him it was there.
- I didn't say anything. That's a lie.

315
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:05,716
You want to be a martyr,
fine.

316
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:08,315
If you keep this up,
I don't know what we'll do.

317
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:12,155
What's going on?

318
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:16,833
Nothing. Your brother's gone and
bruised himself again. That's all.

319
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:19,030
Clumsy.

320
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:23,359
Who did this to you?

321
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:27,153
Oh, Reggie. Don't start.

322
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:28,628
Please, don't get paranoid.

323
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:30,429
Don't get paranoid?
This has happened twice.

324
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:34,113
Are you trying to tell me
there's nothing going on?

325
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:37,636
That's not what I'm saying. All
I'm saying is these things happen.

326
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:39,919
He's got to be more careful,
that's all.

327
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:42,071
Mom, why do you refuse to see what
is staring you clearly in the face?

328
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:43,992
This is not normal.

329
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:45,832
We'll talk to your grandpa. Maybe
he can talk to Paul. I don't know.

330
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:47,308
What more
do you want me to do?

331
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:51,835
I need to get the rust off the floor.
Where did you guys put the matt knife?

332
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:55,792
I was opening boxes yesterday.
It's gotta be in there somewhere.

333
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:58,269
I don't understand you.

334
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:01,510
- Honestly, I don't.
- What's going on here?

335
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:03,829
Everything's fine. Great.

336
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:06,275
Couldn't be better,
right, mom?

337
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:09,317
Fantastic. Maybe you ought
to unpack something.

338
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:19,595
What's up?

339
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,752
You said you weren't going
to ask me why.

340
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:25,469
What?

341
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:28,759
Why I'm staying.

342
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:31,916
And?

343
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:34,599
I wanted you to ask me.

344
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:40,596
My dad's kind of sick.

345
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:44,356
He has this disease.

346
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:48,839
It's called
"Haughtington's Syndrome".

347
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:54,596
Just before Paul
was born it got really bad.

348
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:57,791
He was having attacks.

349
00:31:58,480 --> 00:31:59,708
But you can't imagine

350
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:03,753
what it must be like
to be afraid of your own father.

351
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,309
But...
he's okay now.

352
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:12,352
The treatment took.

353
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:15,513
He's been fine for years
until now.

354
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:17,835
Until now?

355
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:21,709
He's not doing so good.

356
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:25,874
And there's definitely
something wrong with Paul.

357
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:30,114
He's woken up
with bruises twice now.

358
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:32,112
Hold on.

359
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:35,796
- You don't think?
- I don't think anything.

360
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:39,830
He's acting weird
and he barely speaks.

361
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:45,994
Sometimes I think it's that house.

362
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:41,155
You know, this thing is much
more complicated than it looks.

363
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:43,476
Where's Paul?

364
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:47,559
Grandfather came to talk to him.
They're upstairs.

365
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:01,589
- I'm a mother. Mothers worry.
- Don't worry.

366
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:03,515
Regina...

367
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:05,830
I was beginning to think
I wouldn't get to see you.

368
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:06,876
Hi, grampa.

369
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:09,959
- You're going to catch a cold.
- Dry off, hon.

370
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:12,990
Try and get him to stay
for dinner.

371
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:15,396
Thanks again.

372
00:34:19,160 --> 00:34:20,115
How are you?

373
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:22,393
I'm good. And Paul?

374
00:34:22,640 --> 00:34:23,675
He's fine.

375
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:26,233
I'm sure this is no big deal.

376
00:34:26,680 --> 00:34:27,874
The change of houses,

377
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:30,311
habits, environment.

378
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:34,311
But he's never been afraid
of the dark before.

379
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:39,316
I don't think that Paul's fear
of darkness is your biggest concern.

380
00:34:41,680 --> 00:34:43,033
Why would he hurt hinself?

381
00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:45,838
He'sjust trying to call attention.

382
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:48,838
But Dad's been strange too.

383
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:51,394
He's worse.

384
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:53,829
He's aggressive

385
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:56,389
- Like he used to be.
- That's nonsense, Regina.

386
00:34:57,680 --> 00:35:00,558
I know what you all went through.
And I know it wasn't easy.

387
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:02,349
But your father

388
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:03,874
is under control now.

389
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:06,835
You need to stop worrying.
Nothing is going to happen.

390
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:09,471
- All right, dear?
- Thanks, granpa.

391
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:11,395
And now, I'm off.

392
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:48,391
He says
we shouldn't worry.

393
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:51,910
Kids do strange things sometimes.

394
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:54,755
We have to find a place
to hang that picture.

395
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:57,879
I don't know...

396
00:36:58,120 --> 00:36:59,838
Mark, please.
We're talking

397
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:01,115
about our children.

398
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:32,078
They're going through a rough time.

399
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:33,230
Reggie...

400
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:35,798
she's at a difficult age.

401
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:38,196
Maybe we're not being understanding
enough with her.

402
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:40,270
And what about me?

403
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:42,439
Who's being understanding with me?

404
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,911
- What are you talking about?
- Come on, please.

405
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:49,870
You don't think

406
00:37:50,120 --> 00:37:52,509
I hear the little secret conversations
that go on behind my back?

407
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:53,871
You're losing it.

408
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:57,797
Right. Exactly. That's exactly
the attitude I'm talking about.

409
00:37:58,160 --> 00:37:58,956
Thank you.

410
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:01,078
I know where they get it from now.

411
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:48,274
Mark, please, calm down.

412
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:53,718
Did you take your medication?

413
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:15,396
Mark!

414
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:34,352
Mark?

415
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:50,075
Mark!

416
00:39:51,160 --> 00:39:52,309
Regina!

417
00:39:57,360 --> 00:39:58,190
Mom?

418
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:02,957
Reggie, quickly!

419
00:40:03,240 --> 00:40:04,229
Come over here.

420
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:05,749
I'm feeling kinda woozy.

421
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:08,318
Slow breaths, okay?

422
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:10,358
Hold it.
I have to get the alcohol.

423
00:40:18,080 --> 00:40:19,195
Not now!

424
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:21,957
Mom!

425
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:35,790
Mom!

426
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:41,557
Mom!

427
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:53,428
Where's the fuse box?

428
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:56,395
In the laundry room.

429
00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:19,716
Reggie!

430
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:20,676
Paul?

431
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:32,795
Paul, what's the matter?
Let me in.

432
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:41,789
They won't let me.

433
00:41:42,360 --> 00:41:44,715
- There's someone here.
- Paul, let me in.

434
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:46,510
I can't.

435
00:41:48,040 --> 00:41:49,439
- Paul!
- Dad!

436
00:41:49,720 --> 00:41:50,470
Shut up!

437
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:52,549
You're scaring him!

438
00:41:56,040 --> 00:41:57,109
I said, stop it! Dad!

439
00:41:57,840 --> 00:41:58,716
Open this door right now!

440
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:00,237
Mom!

441
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,150
- Stop it!
- Shut up!

442
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:09,916
Let me go!

443
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:11,470
Stop!

444
00:42:22,080 --> 00:42:24,799
Paul, honey, come here.
It's okay.

445
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:26,110
It's okay.

446
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:27,876
It's okay.

447
00:42:32,320 --> 00:42:33,275
I don't know.

448
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,639
I got scared.
We couldn't open the door.

449
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:41,391
Baby,

450
00:42:41,640 --> 00:42:43,915
- Are you all right?
- What's wrong with you?

451
00:43:11,320 --> 00:43:14,232
I'm here now. It's okay.
It's all over.

452
00:43:15,640 --> 00:43:17,039
It's not all over.

453
00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:20,553
They never go away.
They only hide.

454
00:43:22,440 --> 00:43:24,954
Who? What are you talking about?

455
00:43:25,720 --> 00:43:27,517
The kids.

456
00:43:28,680 --> 00:43:29,749
What kids?

457
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:33,712
The ones in my room.
They wouldn't let me out.

458
00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:37,632
They hate me.
They say I'm an impostor.

459
00:43:40,600 --> 00:43:41,396
Paul,

460
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:44,678
there's no one else here.

461
00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:47,868
Just you and me,

462
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:49,948
and mom and dad.

463
00:43:52,080 --> 00:43:53,354
Those kids don't exist.

464
00:43:54,440 --> 00:43:55,873
You're imagining them.

465
00:43:56,880 --> 00:43:59,713
Yes they do.
They come out when it's dark.

466
00:43:59,960 --> 00:44:01,359
They live in the dark.

467
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:04,279
Didn't you hear them?

468
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:07,595
Didn't you?

469
00:44:24,320 --> 00:44:25,753
- Hello.
- Carlos?

470
00:44:26,240 --> 00:44:29,198
- Reggie, is it late?
- I know. I know, I'm sorry.

471
00:44:30,360 --> 00:44:31,679
I need your help.

472
00:44:32,120 --> 00:44:33,189
What's wrong?

473
00:44:34,280 --> 00:44:35,315
It's this house.

474
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:04,631
Nobody has ever lived
in your house before.

475
00:45:05,600 --> 00:45:06,794
The guy who sold the house
to your father

476
00:45:07,480 --> 00:45:08,833
doesn't even exist.

477
00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:13,234
Neither does the real estate agent
or the lawyer.

478
00:45:14,080 --> 00:45:17,436
And the phone number that's on the
contract has never been in service.

479
00:45:18,320 --> 00:45:21,073
So there's nothing we can check?

480
00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:25,755
Maybe. I found some information
about the architect.

481
00:45:36,320 --> 00:45:37,309
Great.

482
00:45:38,240 --> 00:45:39,434
Excellent. Wanna help me?

483
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:43,117
Where's Regina?

484
00:45:43,360 --> 00:45:45,430
She left at the crack of dawn.
I don't know.

485
00:46:09,590 --> 00:46:10,818
There's no one here.

486
00:46:21,150 --> 00:46:22,469
Hey, I've seen that guy before.

487
00:46:26,550 --> 00:46:28,222
He was standing outside my house,

488
00:46:28,950 --> 00:46:30,986
the other night, when it was raining.

489
00:46:32,510 --> 00:46:34,387
I'm sure it's him.

490
00:46:37,550 --> 00:46:38,380
Come on.

491
00:46:56,790 --> 00:46:58,303
You shouldn't have come.

492
00:47:02,830 --> 00:47:05,663
- You designed the house, right?
- I just drew the plans according

493
00:47:05,910 --> 00:47:08,140
to the measurements
they gave me.

494
00:47:08,390 --> 00:47:09,266
They?

495
00:47:10,390 --> 00:47:11,505
They who?

496
00:47:11,910 --> 00:47:13,423
I never saw anyone.

497
00:47:16,070 --> 00:47:18,220
Everything was taken care
of through an intermediary.

498
00:47:20,150 --> 00:47:21,947
All I had to do was draw

499
00:47:22,550 --> 00:47:23,744
and keep quiet.

500
00:47:25,790 --> 00:47:28,179
That was the one thing
they insisted on.

501
00:47:30,510 --> 00:47:32,580
But that wasn't the strange part.

502
00:47:38,150 --> 00:47:39,424
We've got to talk.

503
00:47:41,230 --> 00:47:44,666
Oh, yes. We've got to talk,
about that thing you hung up there.

504
00:47:45,310 --> 00:47:46,345
It's hideous.

505
00:47:46,830 --> 00:47:48,627
What are you talking about?
You told me to hang it there.

506
00:47:49,110 --> 00:47:49,826
What?

507
00:47:50,470 --> 00:47:51,266
Last night.

508
00:47:51,510 --> 00:47:52,420
Right here.

509
00:47:54,910 --> 00:47:55,820
Honey,

510
00:47:56,550 --> 00:47:58,427
- That is not the problem.
- Oh, no?

511
00:47:58,830 --> 00:48:00,024
Then what is the problem?

512
00:48:01,110 --> 00:48:02,179
The larvae.

513
00:48:02,550 --> 00:48:03,300
The what?

514
00:48:03,630 --> 00:48:04,699
The larvae.

515
00:48:05,990 --> 00:48:07,105
They're everywhere.

516
00:48:07,390 --> 00:48:08,379
In the walls.

517
00:48:11,910 --> 00:48:13,787
I hear them whisper.

518
00:48:16,710 --> 00:48:18,223
They talk about us.

519
00:48:27,510 --> 00:48:28,909
We've got to do something.

520
00:48:37,870 --> 00:48:39,019
It was the design.

521
00:48:40,590 --> 00:48:42,069
The shape of the house.

522
00:48:43,830 --> 00:48:45,502
In some parts of the world,

523
00:48:45,830 --> 00:48:48,219
a similar form is used

524
00:48:48,470 --> 00:48:49,903
in the design and costruction
of the temples,

525
00:48:50,470 --> 00:48:53,667
or other types
of occult architecture.

526
00:48:54,750 --> 00:48:57,947
Something about giving birth
to spiritual energy,

527
00:48:58,190 --> 00:48:59,225
or entities.

528
00:49:01,070 --> 00:49:02,708
It's been so many years...

529
00:49:02,950 --> 00:49:04,429
But I didn't like it.

530
00:49:07,190 --> 00:49:09,909
- Reggie, I think we'd better get going.
- No, just wait.

531
00:49:11,790 --> 00:49:12,825
And then...

532
00:49:14,030 --> 00:49:15,543
the thing with the kids happened.

533
00:49:38,030 --> 00:49:39,224
What are you planning to do?

534
00:49:45,270 --> 00:49:46,146
Find them.

535
00:49:48,150 --> 00:49:50,664
They must have their nest
underneath this house somewhere.

536
00:49:52,550 --> 00:49:54,108
And I'm going to find it.

537
00:50:14,430 --> 00:50:15,579
Seven children.

538
00:50:23,830 --> 00:50:25,707
They never found them.

539
00:50:30,550 --> 00:50:32,142
Except one.

540
00:50:37,510 --> 00:50:38,943
When the police questioned him,

541
00:50:39,830 --> 00:50:41,980
what he told them didn't make any
sense... It was some crazy story

542
00:50:44,830 --> 00:50:48,106
about a round house.

543
00:50:48,710 --> 00:50:49,825
Just dark.

544
00:50:51,310 --> 00:50:52,538
So dark.

545
00:50:55,070 --> 00:50:57,026
I've spent years obsessed
with this story.

546
00:50:59,150 --> 00:51:00,185
Prowling

547
00:51:00,430 --> 00:51:01,545
around the house.

548
00:51:03,070 --> 00:51:04,662
It's always been empty.

549
00:51:06,070 --> 00:51:06,661
And then suddenly,

550
00:51:06,910 --> 00:51:08,423
one day, I find
that a family's

551
00:51:08,670 --> 00:51:10,228
living there.

552
00:51:10,910 --> 00:51:13,344
With a kid.
For the first time

553
00:51:13,590 --> 00:51:14,705
in 40 years.

554
00:51:16,510 --> 00:51:17,147
Why now?

555
00:51:17,390 --> 00:51:19,301
So why haven't you called
the police?

556
00:51:19,790 --> 00:51:21,189
And tell them what?

557
00:51:21,830 --> 00:51:23,821
You think they'll listen
to the crazy ramblings

558
00:51:24,110 --> 00:51:26,305
of some old fart
with one foot in the grave?

559
00:51:26,550 --> 00:51:28,700
- You could have told somebody.
- Oh, yes,

560
00:51:28,950 --> 00:51:30,065
I could have.

561
00:51:31,430 --> 00:51:32,465
But I didn't,

562
00:51:32,990 --> 00:51:34,264
you want to know why?

563
00:51:35,030 --> 00:51:36,258
Because I was scared.

564
00:51:38,870 --> 00:51:39,859
What are you talking about?

565
00:51:43,630 --> 00:51:44,665
Please go.

566
00:51:45,790 --> 00:51:46,745
That's all I know.

567
00:51:47,510 --> 00:51:48,909
Thank you for sharing
your theories,

568
00:51:49,710 --> 00:51:50,825
mister Villalobos.

569
00:51:51,110 --> 00:51:52,099
My phone number.

570
00:51:54,790 --> 00:51:56,189
In case you remember something.

571
00:51:57,070 --> 00:51:58,219
Get your brother

572
00:51:58,470 --> 00:52:00,301
- Out of the house.
- Why?

573
00:52:00,790 --> 00:52:01,939
Get him out.

574
00:52:46,070 --> 00:52:46,946
Mom!

575
00:52:47,950 --> 00:52:49,383
It's okay.

576
00:52:52,750 --> 00:52:55,708
It's okay. He had another fit,
but it's okay now.

577
00:52:56,590 --> 00:52:59,946
- Let's go.
- No. You're not driving like this.

578
00:53:00,430 --> 00:53:02,307
Carlos, can you take them
to the hospital, please?

579
00:53:03,030 --> 00:53:03,701
Well, what about you?

580
00:53:03,950 --> 00:53:05,827
I'm staying.
There's something I have to do here.

581
00:53:07,110 --> 00:53:08,020
Reggie.

582
00:53:08,270 --> 00:53:09,464
Carlos, please.

583
00:53:10,510 --> 00:53:11,499
Just go.

584
00:56:18,590 --> 00:56:19,340
Hello?

585
00:56:20,030 --> 00:56:20,906
Hello.

586
00:56:28,230 --> 00:56:30,664
We're watching you, bitch.

587
00:56:38,670 --> 00:56:40,023
What the fuck do you want?

588
00:56:40,950 --> 00:56:43,669
Well, I just wanted to tell you
your father will be fine.

589
00:56:45,350 --> 00:56:46,749
If that's all right with you.

590
00:56:46,990 --> 00:56:47,866
Mom,

591
00:56:49,670 --> 00:56:51,661
I'm sorry. I thought
you were someone else.

592
00:56:53,110 --> 00:56:55,226
Well, I guess we've all been
through a lot.

593
00:56:55,550 --> 00:56:59,463
Seems the problem was the tranquilizer
I gave him after he cut himself.

594
00:56:59,790 --> 00:57:02,827
It reacted badly
With the Haloperidol. I'm a nurse.

595
00:57:03,070 --> 00:57:05,459
- I should have known.
- I don't think that's the problem.

596
00:57:06,750 --> 00:57:07,660
We need to talk.

597
00:57:07,910 --> 00:57:11,061
They're keeping him under
observation for a couple of days.

598
00:57:14,070 --> 00:57:14,980
Mom?

599
00:57:17,150 --> 00:57:17,980
Mom.

600
00:59:46,910 --> 00:59:47,706
"Ouroboros."

601
00:59:48,670 --> 00:59:50,308
It's an old occult symbol.

602
00:59:50,910 --> 00:59:52,138
It means darkness,

603
00:59:52,390 --> 00:59:54,301
the return to the beginning,

604
00:59:54,910 --> 00:59:57,424
- Chaos...
- What's going on in my house?

605
01:00:40,670 --> 01:00:42,388
What the hell is this?

606
01:00:47,910 --> 01:00:48,979
It's a ritual.

607
01:00:51,990 --> 01:00:53,025
"Take the breath

608
01:00:53,310 --> 01:00:55,505
and the love out
of seven children.

609
01:00:56,430 --> 01:00:58,705
And close the circle
with their blood

610
01:00:59,710 --> 01:01:01,428
when morning turns to night."

611
01:01:07,590 --> 01:01:08,909
The old man was right.

612
01:01:22,390 --> 01:01:24,267
Seven children's throats cut

613
01:01:25,830 --> 01:01:27,502
by someone who loves them.

614
01:01:32,430 --> 01:01:34,227
When morning turns to night...

615
01:01:45,750 --> 01:01:47,263
The eclipse.

616
01:01:48,750 --> 01:01:49,819
It's tomorrow.

617
01:01:50,550 --> 01:01:52,302
It only happens every 40 years.

618
01:01:56,030 --> 01:01:57,383
The last time they tried it,
something went wrong.

619
01:01:58,430 --> 01:02:00,022
One of the kids escaped.

620
01:02:00,310 --> 01:02:02,505
They had to be seven,
but they only got six.

621
01:02:02,830 --> 01:02:04,388
It's going to happen again.

622
01:02:09,230 --> 01:02:10,265
With Paul.

623
01:02:11,550 --> 01:02:12,505
Reggie,

624
01:02:13,230 --> 01:02:14,948
no one's going
to do anything to Paul.

625
01:02:15,910 --> 01:02:17,468
My dad is sick.

626
01:02:18,110 --> 01:02:20,419
Sometimes he doesn't even know
what he's doing.

627
01:02:24,830 --> 01:02:27,344
- Reggie, you should hear yourself...?
- Mom,

628
01:02:27,550 --> 01:02:28,869
- It's the house.
- You're not.

629
01:02:30,990 --> 01:02:32,582
Dad would never hurt us.

630
01:02:33,070 --> 01:02:35,300
What you're saying is terrible.
It's obscene.

631
01:02:37,630 --> 01:02:40,940
Is that too hard for you to accept
that your father and I...?

632
01:02:41,190 --> 01:02:41,940
Mom! Please!

633
01:02:42,630 --> 01:02:43,983
Dad is sick!

634
01:02:49,030 --> 01:02:50,463
And the stuff that's been going on,
it all fits.

635
01:02:51,910 --> 01:02:53,104
The eclipse is tomorrow.

636
01:02:53,350 --> 01:02:54,578
Just don't go back to that house,
please.

637
01:02:54,830 --> 01:02:56,707
We'll do whatever
your grandfather says,

638
01:02:57,230 --> 01:02:58,822
since he's your father's doctor.
Not you.

639
01:03:50,870 --> 01:03:52,189
- Hello.
- Grampa,

640
01:03:52,990 --> 01:03:55,424
- It's Regina.
- Regina, come up.

641
01:04:11,990 --> 01:04:13,059
It's Villalobos.

642
01:04:13,670 --> 01:04:16,867
Listen, I've found one of the papers
the guy sent me, you know,

643
01:04:17,110 --> 01:04:18,941
the intermediary.

644
01:04:19,750 --> 01:04:20,739
There was a lettherhead,

645
01:04:21,790 --> 01:04:22,779
an address.

646
01:04:23,390 --> 01:04:25,665
And I'm going over there.
And you should too.

647
01:05:33,190 --> 01:05:34,589
Here, this will make you
feel better.

648
01:05:36,190 --> 01:05:37,179
You have to believe me.

649
01:05:38,710 --> 01:05:39,938
I don't know what to do.

650
01:05:41,390 --> 01:05:43,187
I believe you, Regina.

651
01:05:44,150 --> 01:05:45,139
It's just that this...

652
01:05:46,550 --> 01:05:48,029
is all too strange.

653
01:05:48,350 --> 01:05:49,339
I don't know.

654
01:05:50,750 --> 01:05:52,820
I don't understand a lot
of what you've been telling me.

655
01:05:53,310 --> 01:05:54,504
You have to help me.

656
01:05:55,950 --> 01:05:58,623
- You're a doctor. They'll listen to you.
- Okay.

657
01:05:58,950 --> 01:06:00,065
I don't want you to worry.

658
01:06:00,470 --> 01:06:01,789
I'm going to call the hospital.

659
01:06:04,190 --> 01:06:04,986
Please!

660
01:06:07,590 --> 01:06:09,820
Don't let them go back
to the house.

661
01:06:11,870 --> 01:06:12,905
They won't go back.
Trust me.

662
01:06:26,550 --> 01:06:29,701
- Yeah?
- Listen. It's the old man, Villalobos.

663
01:06:30,550 --> 01:06:33,383
He found the address of the guy
Who was sending him instructlons.

664
01:06:33,630 --> 01:06:35,507
He said he was going over there.

665
01:06:35,750 --> 01:06:37,581
Wait. I want to come with you.

666
01:06:38,030 --> 01:06:41,466
It's one of those buildings behind
the park. Number seventeen.

667
01:06:42,870 --> 01:06:44,303
- What?
- Reggie,

668
01:06:45,390 --> 01:06:46,140
numberseventeen.

669
01:06:46,870 --> 01:06:48,701
Number seventeen?

670
01:06:49,910 --> 01:06:51,821
I'll wait for you out in front,

671
01:06:52,830 --> 01:06:56,140
- But I'm here.
- Reggie, wait,

672
01:07:13,590 --> 01:07:14,625
Grandpa.

673
01:08:54,310 --> 01:08:55,265
Regina.

674
01:08:57,110 --> 01:08:58,225
You should have been

675
01:08:58,470 --> 01:08:59,539
in your house.

676
01:09:00,950 --> 01:09:02,099
With your family because
they are in the house.

677
01:09:06,390 --> 01:09:07,869
What are you doing in the dark?

678
01:09:19,830 --> 01:09:21,024
Where's Reggie?

679
01:09:23,590 --> 01:09:24,545
I don't know.

680
01:09:25,390 --> 01:09:26,459
She hasn't called.

681
01:09:27,910 --> 01:09:29,389
I expected her to call.

682
01:09:29,990 --> 01:09:30,581
Let her be.

683
01:09:33,150 --> 01:09:34,742
You know how she's been lately.

684
01:09:48,430 --> 01:09:51,103
In the beginning it
was just science.

685
01:09:52,670 --> 01:09:54,228
You begin studying minds

686
01:09:54,470 --> 01:09:55,585
of children.

687
01:09:56,390 --> 01:09:57,823
How their fears work.

688
01:10:00,670 --> 01:10:02,979
A fear shared by all children.

689
01:10:04,070 --> 01:10:06,823
In all times
and in all cultures.

690
01:10:07,910 --> 01:10:09,138
An irrational fear:

691
01:10:10,070 --> 01:10:11,344
The fear of the dark.

692
01:10:18,950 --> 01:10:20,144
I think I might take a nap.

693
01:10:21,910 --> 01:10:22,865
I'm eshausted.

694
01:10:25,190 --> 01:10:27,226
Sounds like a good idea.

695
01:10:40,510 --> 01:10:42,660
And now,
we are almost ready.

696
01:10:46,510 --> 01:10:48,148
After so many years.

697
01:10:48,830 --> 01:10:50,309
What are you talking about?

698
01:10:52,750 --> 01:10:54,502
About darkness, my dear,

699
01:10:55,150 --> 01:10:56,185
the true darkness.

700
01:10:57,670 --> 01:11:00,389
A kind of evil
in its greatest form.

701
01:11:01,550 --> 01:11:02,505
Pure...

702
01:11:03,910 --> 01:11:05,104
and alive.

703
01:11:14,190 --> 01:11:15,179
And now,

704
01:11:17,270 --> 01:11:19,067
the moment has arrived.

705
01:11:23,470 --> 01:11:24,425
Finally

706
01:11:26,590 --> 01:11:27,386
be born.

707
01:11:33,910 --> 01:11:34,581
Dirty

708
01:11:35,350 --> 01:11:36,544
and perverted.

709
01:11:41,550 --> 01:11:42,585
Don't try so hard,

710
01:11:42,830 --> 01:11:44,024
Regina.

711
01:11:45,190 --> 01:11:46,669
The game has already begun.

712
01:11:59,230 --> 01:12:01,141
The countdown has already begun.

713
01:12:01,910 --> 01:12:04,902
We're getting closer to the moment
When the sun and the moon aligned

714
01:12:05,350 --> 01:12:07,705
submerges for a few moments
in darkness.

715
01:12:10,390 --> 01:12:11,425
Why?

716
01:12:12,470 --> 01:12:13,539
Why?

717
01:12:14,790 --> 01:12:16,143
Because it's a question

718
01:12:16,390 --> 01:12:17,345
of faith.

719
01:12:18,070 --> 01:12:19,742
We are our origin.

720
01:12:20,230 --> 01:12:21,982
And our origin is that.

721
01:12:23,270 --> 01:12:24,862
Evil, disorder...

722
01:12:26,550 --> 01:12:28,506
We discovered
the spell

723
01:12:28,750 --> 01:12:29,819
to get it back.

724
01:12:32,070 --> 01:12:33,025
The egg temple

725
01:12:37,510 --> 01:12:40,070
and seven children's throats cut

726
01:12:40,430 --> 01:12:42,068
by loving hands.

727
01:12:45,630 --> 01:12:47,302
And the eclipse of course.

728
01:13:18,830 --> 01:13:20,388
It's just an experiment.

729
01:13:20,630 --> 01:13:21,619
I'm a doctor.

730
01:13:22,510 --> 01:13:24,580
Do you know what the ancients
called it?

731
01:13:26,110 --> 01:13:27,429
"The great liar."

732
01:14:00,230 --> 01:14:02,949
- Where's Regina?
- She's here. Come in.

733
01:14:20,150 --> 01:14:21,742
Thank goodness you came.

734
01:14:22,710 --> 01:14:24,063
I didn't know what to do.

735
01:14:29,710 --> 01:14:31,109
Hey. What's going on here?

736
01:14:33,870 --> 01:14:35,667
Do you know what's going on here?

737
01:14:36,470 --> 01:14:40,224
What's going on
is that you have fucked up.

738
01:15:28,310 --> 01:15:31,859
I don't know why everyone is trying
to ruin this moment for me.

739
01:15:37,150 --> 01:15:40,062
Once begun
no one can stop it.

740
01:15:41,150 --> 01:15:42,902
There is no way back.

741
01:16:13,190 --> 01:16:14,589
Everything was perfect.

742
01:16:17,670 --> 01:16:18,625
We were seven.

743
01:16:19,990 --> 01:16:21,343
We had built the temple.

744
01:16:23,590 --> 01:16:24,818
And waited for the eclipse.

745
01:16:28,230 --> 01:16:29,743
Each one with his child.

746
01:16:33,830 --> 01:16:36,549
But at the last minute
it fell apart.

747
01:16:37,990 --> 01:16:39,503
I'm the only one left.

748
01:16:40,870 --> 01:16:43,589
The only one who has survived
all these years.

749
01:16:46,030 --> 01:16:47,588
Ironic, isn't it?

750
01:16:50,550 --> 01:16:51,665
Because it was my fault.

751
01:16:55,670 --> 01:16:57,342
I had to let my son escape.

752
01:17:02,230 --> 01:17:03,345
I couldn't do it.

753
01:17:09,030 --> 01:17:10,463
Mom!

754
01:17:12,310 --> 01:17:13,345
Yes, Paul.

755
01:17:14,190 --> 01:17:15,908
Can I have a glass of water?

756
01:17:20,550 --> 01:17:21,380
Mom.

757
01:17:41,870 --> 01:17:42,985
Please, just go away.

758
01:17:55,790 --> 01:17:56,666
You loved him.

759
01:18:00,150 --> 01:18:01,219
Let me go.

760
01:18:02,470 --> 01:18:03,869
We can still stop it.

761
01:18:06,230 --> 01:18:08,744
The rules of the game
are very clear.

762
01:18:11,070 --> 01:18:13,504
Seven children's throats cut

763
01:18:14,350 --> 01:18:16,306
by hands which love them.

764
01:18:17,750 --> 01:18:18,944
Go away?

765
01:18:20,470 --> 01:18:22,267
You want me to go away.

766
01:18:23,070 --> 01:18:24,549
What the hell
are you talking about?

767
01:18:26,430 --> 01:18:27,658
This is my house.

768
01:18:33,150 --> 01:18:35,141
Open the fucking door!

769
01:18:36,670 --> 01:18:37,989
Now!

770
01:18:40,990 --> 01:18:42,139
The last minute

771
01:18:42,830 --> 01:18:44,821
I realized it wouldn't work,

772
01:18:47,750 --> 01:18:49,229
because, honestly,

773
01:18:51,070 --> 01:18:52,219
I didn't love him.

774
01:19:00,710 --> 01:19:01,620
Mark?

775
01:19:02,470 --> 01:19:04,540
Please, just go away.

776
01:19:13,990 --> 01:19:16,504
Paul doesn't have any thing
to do with this.

777
01:19:21,510 --> 01:19:23,785
You haven't understood anything,
have you?

778
01:19:25,390 --> 01:19:26,027
It's not Paul,

779
01:19:26,630 --> 01:19:27,619
you idiot.

780
01:19:28,710 --> 01:19:30,268
It's your father.

781
01:19:31,590 --> 01:19:32,227
What?

782
01:19:33,950 --> 01:19:35,542
It has to be the same child.

783
01:19:37,630 --> 01:19:38,779
Mark, just leave us alone.

784
01:19:39,630 --> 01:19:40,858
Open this fucking door!

785
01:19:41,670 --> 01:19:42,625
Mark!

786
01:19:46,510 --> 01:19:47,545
Mark, you're sick.

787
01:19:48,310 --> 01:19:50,619
You're not taking your medicine,
that's why you're sick.

788
01:19:51,350 --> 01:19:52,305
No!

789
01:19:52,990 --> 01:19:54,025
Liar! That's a lie!

790
01:20:01,230 --> 01:20:02,788
Please, Mark, go.

791
01:20:03,030 --> 01:20:04,463
- Can't you see you're sick?
- Mom...

792
01:20:05,070 --> 01:20:06,549
It wasn't dad.

793
01:20:08,830 --> 01:20:10,183
He didn't hit me.

794
01:20:12,190 --> 01:20:13,179
It's impossible.

795
01:20:15,710 --> 01:20:16,825
It'll never happen.

796
01:20:21,150 --> 01:20:23,300
Darkness
is very wise.

797
01:20:25,670 --> 01:20:27,661
Knows very well
what a mother

798
01:20:28,110 --> 01:20:30,385
is capable of doing
to protect her young.

799
01:21:09,270 --> 01:21:10,783
Mark, enough!

800
01:21:21,870 --> 01:21:22,985
This is my toy.

801
01:21:24,790 --> 01:21:25,984
A snake,

802
01:21:26,310 --> 01:21:28,141
and something about
to be born.

803
01:21:29,790 --> 01:21:31,508
It sounds familiar, doesn't it?

804
01:21:38,110 --> 01:21:39,304
It'll never happen.

805
01:21:40,590 --> 01:21:41,864
I saw it in the book.

806
01:21:43,270 --> 01:21:44,988
The throat has

807
01:21:45,230 --> 01:21:46,185
to be cut...

808
01:21:48,990 --> 01:21:51,902
and my mother wouldn't do that.
It's impossible.

809
01:21:52,710 --> 01:21:54,063
Have faith, Regina.

810
01:21:56,430 --> 01:21:58,546
Darkness knows a great deal.

811
01:22:03,390 --> 01:22:05,904
Okay. Here's my medication.

812
01:22:07,150 --> 01:22:07,900
Mark.

813
01:22:09,430 --> 01:22:10,465
What are you doing?

814
01:22:16,190 --> 01:22:17,942
Here are the goddamn pills.

815
01:22:18,590 --> 01:22:19,909
Daddy.

816
01:22:22,870 --> 01:22:24,861
I'm so sorry.

817
01:22:28,270 --> 01:22:29,419
I love you.

818
01:22:31,630 --> 01:22:32,619
I love you.

819
01:22:34,110 --> 01:22:34,860
So much.

820
01:22:52,670 --> 01:22:53,307
Run.

821
01:22:55,470 --> 01:22:56,789
You don't have much time.

822
01:22:58,270 --> 01:22:59,225
Run!

823
01:23:05,630 --> 01:23:06,858
It's your turn.

824
01:23:27,870 --> 01:23:28,620
Answer me!

825
01:23:31,910 --> 01:23:34,140
Pills. Fucking pills.

826
01:23:34,790 --> 01:23:36,143
You want me to take pills...

827
01:23:42,910 --> 01:23:44,104
What's going on?

828
01:24:28,950 --> 01:24:29,462
Paul,

829
01:24:30,710 --> 01:24:33,224
go get a pen. I've got to open him up
or he's going to die.

830
01:24:34,590 --> 01:24:35,067
Go!

831
01:24:57,510 --> 01:24:58,067
Paul, hurry!

832
01:25:21,430 --> 01:25:23,421
Paul, you should just go up
to your room and don't look.

833
01:25:26,070 --> 01:25:27,185
Just go, now!

834
01:26:07,670 --> 01:26:08,819
Mom, no!

835
01:26:09,710 --> 01:26:10,904
What are you doing?

836
01:26:11,150 --> 01:26:13,345
He needs air.
I gotta open his throat.

837
01:26:13,630 --> 01:26:15,109
Get out of my way. Don't you
understand that's what it wants?

838
01:26:15,350 --> 01:26:16,465
Your father is dying.

839
01:26:21,510 --> 01:26:23,228
I gotta open his throat,
let him breathe.

840
01:26:36,190 --> 01:26:38,306
I can't do it.

841
01:26:38,950 --> 01:26:39,985
I can't do it.

842
01:26:44,950 --> 01:26:47,464
Give it to me. I'll do it.
Just tell me what to do.

843
01:27:03,150 --> 01:27:05,664
A clean cut just
under the Adam's apple.

844
01:27:09,750 --> 01:27:10,705
Quickly.

845
01:27:16,510 --> 01:27:17,067
Mom!

846
01:27:19,510 --> 01:27:20,784
Now get the tube.

847
01:27:21,390 --> 01:27:23,028
Put it in his throat.

848
01:27:25,950 --> 01:27:28,020
What tube? What tube?

849
01:27:28,350 --> 01:27:30,147
- It's here.
- Mom!

850
01:27:39,190 --> 01:27:40,100
Where is it?

851
01:27:40,870 --> 01:27:42,508
Mom!

852
01:27:43,150 --> 01:27:43,866
Where?

853
01:27:45,870 --> 01:27:46,666
Mom!

854
01:27:47,230 --> 01:27:48,026
It's too late.

855
01:27:49,230 --> 01:27:50,140
Mom!

856
01:28:07,710 --> 01:28:08,859
It's over.

857
01:28:10,070 --> 01:28:11,389
The seventh child

858
01:28:12,550 --> 01:28:13,665
is dead.

859
01:28:19,070 --> 01:28:19,946
Where's...

860
01:28:22,470 --> 01:28:23,141
Regina?

861
01:28:25,550 --> 01:28:26,699
In her house.

862
01:28:33,030 --> 01:28:34,179
In hell.

863
01:28:38,270 --> 01:28:39,419
Where's the flashlight?

864
01:28:40,510 --> 01:28:41,420
Where is it?

865
01:28:45,510 --> 01:28:48,024
Mom, we have to get out of here.
Where's Paul?

866
01:28:49,870 --> 01:28:51,747
- Where is he? Where is he?
- Upstairs.

867
01:29:14,070 --> 01:29:15,742
- Regina!
- Paul!

868
01:29:18,550 --> 01:29:19,699
I'm scared.

869
01:29:25,550 --> 01:29:26,744
Paul, I'm coming.

870
01:29:36,910 --> 01:29:37,820
Regina!

871
01:29:42,390 --> 01:29:43,903
Come with me.

872
01:29:58,670 --> 01:29:59,659
It's tricking us.
It's trying to fool us.

873
01:30:00,510 --> 01:30:01,829
It's a liar.

874
01:30:02,190 --> 01:30:04,101
We're gonna get out
of here right now.

875
01:30:08,270 --> 01:30:09,146
Mom?

876
01:30:11,790 --> 01:30:12,825
Don't be afraid.

877
01:30:14,230 --> 01:30:15,345
We can end this.

878
01:30:16,190 --> 01:30:17,942
It's just a question
of not being afraid.

879
01:30:22,710 --> 01:30:25,304
- He's dead.
- No, he's not.

880
01:30:27,470 --> 01:30:29,700
I want Daddy back, Mommy.

881
01:30:31,350 --> 01:30:32,544
We can save him.

882
01:30:34,150 --> 01:30:36,345
You just have to turn off
the burners.

883
01:30:37,470 --> 01:30:39,984
It's the only way to fight
the darkness.

884
01:30:41,070 --> 01:30:43,459
We don't have much time left.

885
01:30:44,230 --> 01:30:45,379
You have to trust me, Regina.

886
01:30:45,950 --> 01:30:46,905
What are you saying?

887
01:30:47,350 --> 01:30:48,544
For once in your life,

888
01:30:49,350 --> 01:30:51,022
you'll just have to trust me.

889
01:30:52,030 --> 01:30:52,542
No.

890
01:30:53,470 --> 01:30:54,585
Turn the light off.

891
01:30:55,510 --> 01:30:56,386
Turn them off.

892
01:30:57,390 --> 01:30:58,266
You can save him.

893
01:30:58,870 --> 01:31:00,826
- Please, Mom.
- I don't understand.

894
01:31:01,270 --> 01:31:02,225
You're a liar.

895
01:31:04,710 --> 01:31:05,904
Turn it off.

896
01:31:06,150 --> 01:31:07,265
You're not my mother.

897
01:31:14,350 --> 01:31:15,146
Turn them off.

898
01:31:17,870 --> 01:31:18,780
Do it for Dad.

899
01:31:27,790 --> 01:31:28,620
Mom?

900
01:31:29,430 --> 01:31:30,340
Mom!

901
01:31:32,030 --> 01:31:33,383
Where is Mom?

902
01:31:34,830 --> 01:31:35,899
She's not here.

903
01:31:36,430 --> 01:31:37,909
Don't look.
We gotta get out of here.

904
01:31:50,070 --> 01:31:51,264
Come on.
We gotta get out of here.

905
01:31:51,510 --> 01:31:52,579
Try the window.

906
01:31:53,510 --> 01:31:55,307
We'll try the window.

907
01:32:05,110 --> 01:32:06,099
Come on. Stand back.

908
01:32:15,030 --> 01:32:17,749
Come on, we have to get out
right now. Come on, jump.

909
01:32:18,590 --> 01:32:19,579
Come on!

910
01:32:23,630 --> 01:32:26,667
- Come in.
- Get in the car right now, honey.

911
01:32:27,790 --> 01:32:28,939
It's gonna be okay.

912
01:32:53,590 --> 01:32:55,262
Are we going back to the States?

913
01:32:56,350 --> 01:32:57,021
Yeah.

914
01:33:06,430 --> 01:33:08,864
Come on up. I want you
to see something.

915
01:33:09,390 --> 01:33:10,505
You're gonna love it.

916
01:33:15,190 --> 01:33:16,384
It's tricking us.

917
01:33:16,670 --> 01:33:17,625
It's a liar.

918
01:33:18,430 --> 01:33:19,465
It's over, Paul.

919
01:33:20,790 --> 01:33:21,745
No.
