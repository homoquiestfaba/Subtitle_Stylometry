1
00:01:57,947 --> 00:02:00,199
It is and that stinks.

2
00:02:11,293 --> 00:02:13,420
What happened to all the money?

3
00:02:17,007 --> 00:02:18,550
You'd be lucky for looking like me.

4
00:02:18,592 --> 00:02:20,469
I can't afford to look like...

5
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:55,713
Mr. Sheldon?

6
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:58,340
Maybe he's not here.

7
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:06,432
Aren't you home?

8
00:03:06,515 --> 00:03:07,766
Help me, Lord.

9
00:03:14,356 --> 00:03:15,733
How are you doing?

10
00:03:16,942 --> 00:03:20,362
I was just looking for a sweater. Here it is.

11
00:03:22,323 --> 00:03:25,075
We'll teach you.
When was the last time you take a bath?

12
00:03:25,868 --> 00:03:28,579
What you think, Tony?
Maybe we should open a window.

13
00:03:29,747 --> 00:03:32,666
Wait! As soon as I finish the book,
you get the money!

14
00:03:32,708 --> 00:03:35,085
You say that last time.
And the time before.

15
00:03:35,586 --> 00:03:36,670
Wait!

16
00:03:39,757 --> 00:03:43,093
There's nothing but pavement.
There's not an awning in sight.

17
00:03:43,135 --> 00:03:45,554
Wait! I swear I'm almost finished!

18
00:03:45,679 --> 00:03:49,308
- How close?
- Very close. Insanely close.

19
00:03:54,813 --> 00:03:58,817
It was a little slow going at the start,
but I'm really cooking along now.

20
00:03:59,068 --> 00:04:00,402
Show us.

21
00:04:00,653 --> 00:04:02,488
- Show you?
- Show us.

22
00:04:05,783 --> 00:04:09,161
Have you guys been working out together?
How do I get that look?

23
00:04:09,203 --> 00:04:12,331
You know, see,
I think I've been doing too much cardio.

24
00:04:13,207 --> 00:04:14,833
You write on this?

25
00:04:14,917 --> 00:04:18,796
Yeah, it's all right there.
Just a couple of chapters to go. It's good.

26
00:04:20,214 --> 00:04:21,256
Show us.

27
00:04:21,465 --> 00:04:24,343
An author doesn't really
like to show what he's...

28
00:04:24,468 --> 00:04:26,804
Show us the book, Mr. Sheldon.

29
00:04:27,137 --> 00:04:30,599
I can't. I'm blocked. I haven't started.

30
00:04:31,058 --> 00:04:32,935
- You lie?
- Yeah.

31
00:04:34,144 --> 00:04:35,896
- That's bad.
- I know.

32
00:04:36,438 --> 00:04:37,648
Very bad.

33
00:04:37,982 --> 00:04:41,151
- What do we do?
- I'll tell you what we're going to do.

34
00:04:41,902 --> 00:04:44,113
We're gonna
do a little science experiment.

35
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:46,657
- What are you doing?
- Sit down.

36
00:04:46,907 --> 00:04:49,702
Curious what it's like to be
"cooking along" on a computer.

37
00:04:49,868 --> 00:04:53,789
Come on, please don't do that! How'd you
expect me to write without a computer?

38
00:04:53,831 --> 00:04:57,751
We don't expect you to write, Mr. Sheldon.
We expect you to flatten.

39
00:04:59,169 --> 00:05:00,963
Wait, please don't do this.

40
00:05:00,963 --> 00:05:03,882
Let's rethink this. Come on, guys.
Let's rethink it.

41
00:05:06,385 --> 00:05:09,930
I'll double what I owe you! $100,000!

42
00:05:10,014 --> 00:05:11,307
In 30 days.

43
00:05:11,348 --> 00:05:13,601
Okay! 30 days, that's good!

44
00:05:13,642 --> 00:05:16,478
I'll do it.
You'll have your money in 30 days.

45
00:05:18,856 --> 00:05:22,985
- I gave you $75,000. Where did that go?
- Florida Gaming Commission.

46
00:05:23,152 --> 00:05:25,279
- What?
- Hialeah dog track.

47
00:05:27,156 --> 00:05:31,702
- You gambled away $75,000 on dogs?
- A little more than that.

48
00:05:31,827 --> 00:05:35,039
See, I borrowed from some
Cuban gentlemen down Miami way.

49
00:05:35,164 --> 00:05:38,500
You know, Alex, you have a major talent...

50
00:05:38,834 --> 00:05:40,669
but you're pissing it away.

51
00:05:40,753 --> 00:05:44,173
You get $125,000
when I get the manuscript.

52
00:05:44,298 --> 00:05:45,716
That's the deal we made.

53
00:05:45,758 --> 00:05:48,177
I've given you a year.
What have you been doing?

54
00:05:48,761 --> 00:05:52,222
- I fell in love. It didn't work out.
- Perfect!

55
00:05:52,514 --> 00:05:55,476
A love affair gone bad,
gambling, criminal types.

56
00:05:55,559 --> 00:05:57,353
All the elements of a bestseller.

57
00:05:57,394 --> 00:06:01,565
You see, they're going to kill me
if I don't get the money in 30 days.

58
00:06:01,982 --> 00:06:03,651
Then you'd better get to work.

59
00:06:46,110 --> 00:06:47,987
- Hi.
- Sorry.

60
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:51,282
Is there possibly
another Cambridge Street?

61
00:06:51,407 --> 00:06:55,244
I'm looking for the law offices of Polk,
Taylor, Fillmore, Pierce...

62
00:06:56,036 --> 00:06:58,580
- And Van Buren.
- That's us.

63
00:06:59,748 --> 00:07:00,874
Miss...

64
00:07:02,293 --> 00:07:04,920
Dinsmore. Emma Dinsmore.

65
00:07:05,254 --> 00:07:07,214
Alex Sheldon. Won't you come in?

66
00:07:07,298 --> 00:07:10,968
No, I don't believe I will.
This doesn't look like a law office.

67
00:07:11,969 --> 00:07:15,139
- Doesn't even look like a nice place to live.
- I know.

68
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:19,184
Our offices in the Prudential Tower,
which by the way, are very impressive...

69
00:07:19,268 --> 00:07:22,396
you know, law books,
conference tables, leather...

70
00:07:22,646 --> 00:07:26,066
they're being redecorated,
but there's been a holdup with the marble.

71
00:07:26,150 --> 00:07:30,321
Something about the cutters in Carrara
wanting better health benefits.

72
00:07:45,085 --> 00:07:47,421
Mr. Sheldon, I'm going to leave now.

73
00:07:48,714 --> 00:07:52,635
How can I leave
if I have a dead lawyer lying on my foot?

74
00:07:53,844 --> 00:07:55,262
How can I do that?

75
00:07:55,596 --> 00:07:58,140
What kind of person
would I be, Mr. Sheldon?

76
00:07:58,599 --> 00:08:02,311
Not a good one. Not a very good one.
Okay, come on.

77
00:08:02,895 --> 00:08:04,772
I'll get you out of the door...

78
00:08:04,813 --> 00:08:07,107
put you in the...

79
00:08:08,359 --> 00:08:09,944
reception area.

80
00:08:12,863 --> 00:08:14,198
Better yet...

81
00:08:14,782 --> 00:08:17,785
let's put you in your conference room.

82
00:08:18,494 --> 00:08:21,830
This way, if you're preparing
for your big case...

83
00:08:21,956 --> 00:08:24,208
you can just do it here.

84
00:08:29,129 --> 00:08:31,632
- Mr. Sheldon?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

85
00:08:38,013 --> 00:08:41,475
This has only happened to me
one time before.

86
00:08:42,977 --> 00:08:45,271
Little League, championship game.

87
00:08:45,688 --> 00:08:48,816
I was up with the bases loaded
in the bottom of the ninth.

88
00:08:48,899 --> 00:08:51,110
- I hadn't eaten lunch that...
- I have to go.

89
00:08:51,193 --> 00:08:53,570
Please, wait a second. I need your help.

90
00:08:53,737 --> 00:08:55,364
Unhand me!

91
00:08:56,865 --> 00:09:00,327
- Did you say, "Unhand me"?
- I won't be taken advantage of.

92
00:09:00,703 --> 00:09:03,038
Miss Dinsmore, I had no intention...

93
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:06,000
Then why did you ask my company
to send me up here?

94
00:09:06,083 --> 00:09:09,920
Because you're not fooling anyone,
Mr. Sheldon, if that's even your real name.

95
00:09:09,962 --> 00:09:13,966
This is clearly not the law office of Polk,
Taylor, Fillmore, Pierce, Van Buren...

96
00:09:14,008 --> 00:09:17,386
who just happen to have been presidents
of the United States.

97
00:09:17,469 --> 00:09:21,348
You're right. This isn't a law office,
and yes, indeed, they were presidents.

98
00:09:21,432 --> 00:09:24,893
Yes, so what other conclusion
can we draw from this, Mr. Sheldon...

99
00:09:24,977 --> 00:09:27,438
except that
you're trying to take advantage of me?

100
00:09:27,479 --> 00:09:32,234
- We could also conclude that I'm a liar.
- Yes, we could, and in fact, we have.

101
00:09:34,778 --> 00:09:39,325
I'm sorry. It's just that I really
need your help, Miss Dinsmore.

102
00:09:39,408 --> 00:09:43,871
- You see, I'm a brilliant novelist...
- Yeah, and I invented nuclear energy.

103
00:09:43,954 --> 00:09:47,291
- Excuse me, I have to split some atoms.
- Wait!

104
00:09:57,092 --> 00:09:59,094
Could we try to put this behind us?

105
00:09:59,178 --> 00:10:02,139
I just want your stenography services.
That's all.

106
00:10:02,181 --> 00:10:04,350
I assure you, I'm a desperate man.

107
00:10:04,975 --> 00:10:08,812
I don't intend on spending my time in the
personal apartment of a desperate man.

108
00:10:08,938 --> 00:10:12,483
You want sex, Mr. Sheldon,
you are barking up the wrong body.

109
00:10:12,524 --> 00:10:15,778
Miss Dinsmore, I know my veracity
has been called into question...

110
00:10:15,861 --> 00:10:20,574
but I swear to God that barking up your
body is the furthest thing from my mind.

111
00:10:21,033 --> 00:10:22,785
Well, I don't believe you.

112
00:10:23,744 --> 00:10:28,040
Right now, I can't think of any woman
I'm less interested in going to bed with.

113
00:10:28,082 --> 00:10:31,669
- Nice meeting you.
- What was that supposed to mean?

114
00:10:33,253 --> 00:10:37,800
I only meant that while I'm sure
many men would be thrilled...

115
00:10:37,967 --> 00:10:41,720
to find themselves in bed with
such a forthright woman as yourself...

116
00:10:41,804 --> 00:10:46,016
I just have different tastes, that's all.
I prefer women that are more...

117
00:10:47,142 --> 00:10:48,519
Less forthright.

118
00:10:50,854 --> 00:10:54,525
Mr. Sheldon, didn't you expect
that whoever showed up...

119
00:10:54,566 --> 00:10:57,861
would immediately find out
that you weren't a law office?

120
00:10:59,655 --> 00:11:04,326
I owe some guys $100,000
and I got to get it to them in 30 days.

121
00:11:04,493 --> 00:11:07,705
The only way I can do that
is by finishing my next book...

122
00:11:07,788 --> 00:11:11,875
and the only way I can do that
is by dictating it to a stenographer.

123
00:11:13,585 --> 00:11:15,879
- How much do you have left?
- All of it.

124
00:11:16,714 --> 00:11:19,842
- You want to dictate an entire book to me?
- That's right.

125
00:11:20,426 --> 00:11:22,636
- In 30 days?
- Correct.

126
00:11:23,554 --> 00:11:27,558
I get $15 an hour, and I expect to be paid
at the conclusion of each day.

127
00:11:27,641 --> 00:11:30,686
And I'd really like to do that,
but unfortunately, I can't.

128
00:11:30,728 --> 00:11:32,104
At the end of each week.

129
00:11:32,146 --> 00:11:35,190
At the end of the job.
I get paid when I turn in the manuscript.

130
00:11:35,316 --> 00:11:37,860
What happens if you don't finish
in 30 days?

131
00:11:37,985 --> 00:11:39,570
I'll finish in 30 days.

132
00:11:39,612 --> 00:11:42,656
But if you don't finish in 30 days,
then what happens?

133
00:11:43,115 --> 00:11:44,533
I get killed.

134
00:12:04,595 --> 00:12:06,221
I forgot my scarf.

135
00:12:14,647 --> 00:12:18,067
Mr. Sheldon, I forgot my scarf.

136
00:12:45,302 --> 00:12:46,845
What's your book about?

137
00:12:47,012 --> 00:12:49,848
It's the story of a man
who's frightened of commitment...

138
00:12:49,807 --> 00:12:53,686
yet so desperately in love with a woman
he's afraid it might kill him.

139
00:12:53,811 --> 00:12:55,229
It's a comedy.

140
00:12:55,938 --> 00:12:59,191
- Does it kill him?
- You'll have to read the book.

141
00:13:02,611 --> 00:13:05,364
- What are you doing?
- I want to see if he dies.

142
00:13:07,241 --> 00:13:09,368
You can't read the end first.

143
00:13:09,451 --> 00:13:12,621
- Then tell me how it ends.
- You have to read the book.

144
00:13:12,705 --> 00:13:16,208
This is how I read books.
If I like the ending, I'll like getting to it.

145
00:13:16,292 --> 00:13:19,712
If I don't like the ending
then I know not to waste my time.

146
00:13:27,636 --> 00:13:29,763
See? Now I want to read this.

147
00:13:36,687 --> 00:13:38,480
What's your new book about?

148
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:40,941
It's about the powerlessness
of being in love...

149
00:13:41,025 --> 00:13:44,862
and how it devours the insides of a person
like a deadly virus.

150
00:13:44,903 --> 00:13:46,697
- Another comedy?
- Yeah.

151
00:13:47,948 --> 00:13:50,784
Will you have another fit
if I ask you how it ends?

152
00:13:50,868 --> 00:13:52,578
I don't know how it ends.

153
00:13:52,870 --> 00:13:55,998
How can you write a story
if you don't know how it ends?

154
00:13:56,206 --> 00:14:00,210
Because I know the characters,
and they tell me where the story goes.

155
00:14:02,379 --> 00:14:03,631
Interesting.

156
00:14:22,608 --> 00:14:24,652
- You're going to do it?
- Yes.

157
00:14:25,903 --> 00:14:26,987
Great!

158
00:14:32,534 --> 00:14:34,662
Read me back what we've got so far.

159
00:14:35,663 --> 00:14:38,916
The summer of Adam Shipley's
sabbatical from Andover.

160
00:14:44,588 --> 00:14:46,548
Maybe if you add a year, you know.

161
00:14:46,590 --> 00:14:49,969
The summer of Adam Shipley's sabbatical
from Andover was in...

162
00:14:50,052 --> 00:14:53,013
And then any four-digit number
gets you a complete sentence.

163
00:14:53,097 --> 00:14:55,391
Yeah, but not a particularly good one.

164
00:14:55,849 --> 00:14:57,184
How about...

165
00:14:57,810 --> 00:15:02,022
The summer of Adam Shipley's sabbatical
from Andover was really hot?

166
00:15:02,106 --> 00:15:03,482
What's that noise?

167
00:15:03,816 --> 00:15:06,110
- What noise?
- That high-pitched ringing sound.

168
00:15:06,235 --> 00:15:07,695
Kind of like...

169
00:15:09,571 --> 00:15:13,909
I think I may be getting a brain tumor
because that's one of the early signs.

170
00:15:13,993 --> 00:15:17,037
Okay. How about you shorten it?

171
00:15:17,830 --> 00:15:21,250
Adam Shipley took a sabbatical. Period.

172
00:15:21,667 --> 00:15:25,379
No, see, look. You want the first sentence
to set the tone...

173
00:15:25,421 --> 00:15:27,756
to grab the reader
and take him into the story.

174
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:29,800
"Call me Ishmael." Right?

175
00:15:29,842 --> 00:15:32,344
"It was the best of times,
it was the worst of times."

176
00:15:32,469 --> 00:15:35,306
"In the beginning
God created the heaven and the earth."

177
00:15:35,389 --> 00:15:39,435
Do you see why I can't begin?
The giants that have gone before me.

178
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:44,940
Does it seem foggy in here?
There's this haze that...

179
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:49,278
I think the tumor could be spreading
in my occipital lobe.

180
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:51,822
- I have to go.
- It's only 7:00.

181
00:15:51,864 --> 00:15:54,658
I know. These last five hours
have just flown by.

182
00:15:54,950 --> 00:15:57,911
- Will you be back tomorrow morning?
- I can't see why.

183
00:15:58,078 --> 00:15:59,705
What do you mean?

184
00:16:01,123 --> 00:16:04,168
Here's what I've been figuring.
You've got exactly...

185
00:16:05,085 --> 00:16:06,629
eight words so far?

186
00:16:07,004 --> 00:16:11,925
Since a typed page is 350 words,
that's roughly six weeks per page.

187
00:16:11,967 --> 00:16:15,137
With one week off for Christmas,
two weeks summer vacation...

188
00:16:15,262 --> 00:16:18,098
three hundred pages would take
approximately 37 years...

189
00:16:18,182 --> 00:16:22,645
which, quite frankly, is a little more
than I'm willing to allocate to this project.

190
00:16:22,895 --> 00:16:25,814
Miss Dinsmore, I think
you're underestimating the process.

191
00:16:25,898 --> 00:16:27,858
This isn't a comic book, it's a novel.

192
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:30,319
There's character development.
Symbolism. Subtext.

193
00:16:30,444 --> 00:16:33,530
Which do you prefer,
the pepper spray or the stun gun?

194
00:16:36,367 --> 00:16:40,496
Adam Shipley had given up on love.
Art was to be his mistress.

195
00:16:40,663 --> 00:16:43,582
And so it was
that in the summer of 1924...

196
00:16:44,166 --> 00:16:47,086
We're rolling. We just got started.

197
00:16:53,801 --> 00:16:57,680
Adam Shipley had given up on love.
Art was to be his mistress.

198
00:16:58,055 --> 00:17:00,891
And so it was
that in the summer of 1924...

199
00:17:01,183 --> 00:17:05,562
he took a sabbatical from Andover to
write, if not the great American novel...

200
00:17:05,646 --> 00:17:09,024
then certainly one that would make
the world sit up and take notice.

201
00:17:09,108 --> 00:17:11,277
To support himself while he worked...

202
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:13,862
he accepted a position
as an English tutor...

203
00:17:14,113 --> 00:17:17,157
for a French family
vacationing on the island of...

204
00:17:20,619 --> 00:17:21,912
Saint Charles.

205
00:17:22,162 --> 00:17:24,415
Never heard of an island called
Saint Charles.

206
00:17:24,498 --> 00:17:27,960
It's off the coast of Maine,
northeast of Nantucket. Beautiful.

207
00:17:28,252 --> 00:17:30,629
- Still never heard of it.
- I made it up.

208
00:17:30,921 --> 00:17:33,257
- You got a second paragraph?
- A what?

209
00:17:35,134 --> 00:17:38,721
If it's going to be 300 pages
you'll need more than one paragraph.

210
00:17:39,430 --> 00:17:41,890
- That ringing sound.
- I have to go.

211
00:17:43,225 --> 00:17:47,104
Adam boarded a train in Boston,
headed for the ferry at Saint Charles.

212
00:17:47,229 --> 00:17:48,230
And then?

213
00:17:48,439 --> 00:17:52,401
Saint Charles was an exclusive island,
known for palatial mansions...

214
00:17:52,735 --> 00:17:55,696
manicured lawns,
and an exquisite gambling casino.

215
00:17:56,155 --> 00:17:58,866
There was also an especially large
French contingent...

216
00:17:58,866 --> 00:18:01,869
who had claimed the island
after it was discovered by...

217
00:18:01,994 --> 00:18:04,580
Jacques Cartier in the 16th century.

218
00:18:04,788 --> 00:18:06,874
- Wait a minute.
- I'm going too fast?

219
00:18:06,957 --> 00:18:09,710
I thought you said you made up the island.

220
00:18:09,752 --> 00:18:10,878
I did.

221
00:18:11,045 --> 00:18:15,090
But you just said it was discovered
by Jacques Cartier in the 16th century.

222
00:18:16,759 --> 00:18:17,760
Yeah?

223
00:18:18,177 --> 00:18:19,970
Jacques Cartier was a real guy.

224
00:18:20,012 --> 00:18:22,848
You can't have a real guy
discover a fake place.

225
00:18:22,973 --> 00:18:24,016
I can't?

226
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:26,602
No. It's a perversion of history.

227
00:18:26,644 --> 00:18:30,314
If you have a fake place,
you have to have a fake explorer.

228
00:18:30,397 --> 00:18:34,401
- Now, if you have a real place, then you...
- Miss Dinsmore.

229
00:18:38,530 --> 00:18:42,159
I mean, I'm laughing, but I'm not laughing.

230
00:18:42,952 --> 00:18:46,580
If you could type and I could write,
that would be really terrific.

231
00:18:48,332 --> 00:18:49,500
I thought that's what we were doing.

232
00:18:51,293 --> 00:18:55,089
Adam found himself seated
next to a man named John Shaw.

233
00:18:55,381 --> 00:19:00,052
 A man who had the uncanny ability to 
 make a two-hour train ride seem like 10. 

234
00:19:01,011 --> 00:19:04,014
I've been summering in Saint Charles
since I was a boy.

235
00:19:04,515 --> 00:19:07,810
It would be my second home
if I didn't own three others.

236
00:19:07,810 --> 00:19:10,437
 Shaw was a short, round man in his 50s.  

237
00:19:10,562 --> 00:19:12,773
 The word "second" 
 was said with a whistle...  

238
00:19:12,856 --> 00:19:16,819
 as his breath escaped between the space 
 separating his two front teeth.  

239
00:19:17,194 --> 00:19:18,946
 I hate it when they do that.  

240
00:19:19,071 --> 00:19:22,324
- Who? What?
- You. Authors.

241
00:19:22,825 --> 00:19:26,120
You use a name like John Shaw,
and I picture in my mind thin...

242
00:19:26,203 --> 00:19:27,997
with a stylish mustache.

243
00:19:28,038 --> 00:19:32,376
When you finally describe him, he's this
fat old fart with a hole in his teeth.

244
00:19:32,710 --> 00:19:35,462
You remember the part
about you type and I write?

245
00:19:35,546 --> 00:19:38,257
We really have to adhere to that,
Miss Dinsmore.

246
00:19:38,674 --> 00:19:40,801
You're the author. You're God.

247
00:19:41,802 --> 00:19:44,346
You can create
whatever comes into your head.

248
00:19:44,430 --> 00:19:46,515
Characters we like
or characters who make us...

249
00:19:46,557 --> 00:19:49,143
want to shut the book
and never open it again.

250
00:19:50,811 --> 00:19:54,148
Shaw was a slight man
with a thick blond...

251
00:19:54,231 --> 00:19:57,151
 -Thin black.  
 -Thin, black moustache.  

252
00:19:57,359 --> 00:19:59,278
Who's this family you're to tutor?

253
00:19:59,403 --> 00:20:02,281
Saint Charles is a small island.
I'm sure I know them.

254
00:20:02,406 --> 00:20:05,117
They're from Paris.
A divorcee and her two children...

255
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:08,662
an 8-year-old boy, Andre,
and a 6-year-old girl, Michele.

256
00:20:08,746 --> 00:20:11,206
- The mother's name is...
- Polina Delacroix?

257
00:20:11,999 --> 00:20:13,167
Why, yes.

258
00:20:13,667 --> 00:20:16,920
Would you care to join me for some tea
in the dining car?

259
00:20:17,004 --> 00:20:18,088
All right.

260
00:20:22,301 --> 00:20:26,305
 Madame Delacroix seemed very charming 
 in her correspondence.  

261
00:20:26,430 --> 00:20:29,892
She is. And quite the little trooper, too...

262
00:20:29,975 --> 00:20:33,228
putting on such a brave face
under the circumstances.

263
00:20:34,146 --> 00:20:35,439
The circumstances?

264
00:20:35,522 --> 00:20:38,901
The family is in desperate financial straits.

265
00:20:39,193 --> 00:20:41,695
If it weren't for a wealthy grandmother
in Paris...

266
00:20:41,779 --> 00:20:44,239
who's dying, they'd have no hope at all.

267
00:20:44,281 --> 00:20:47,618
Are you certain? Because from
their correspondence they seemed like...

268
00:20:47,701 --> 00:20:50,829
It's a facade. It's all a facade.

269
00:20:50,913 --> 00:20:53,415
But don't worry,
she has enough to pay you.

270
00:20:53,749 --> 00:20:55,376
How can you be so sure?

271
00:20:55,793 --> 00:20:59,964
Because I am returning just now with
a bank draft from my personal account...

272
00:21:00,047 --> 00:21:04,343
which will provide her with enough to
cover her expenses through the summer.

273
00:21:04,426 --> 00:21:05,928
She asked you for a loan?

274
00:21:05,970 --> 00:21:08,973
We're calling it a loan,
but it really doesn't matter.

275
00:21:09,098 --> 00:21:12,101
I intend to ask her to marry me
by summer's end.

276
00:21:12,685 --> 00:21:14,186
 Why did you do that?  

277
00:21:14,395 --> 00:21:18,274
- What? Why did I do what?
- Don't you think it's kind of coincidental...

278
00:21:18,357 --> 00:21:22,194
that Adam just happens to plop down
next to his employer's fiance?

279
00:21:22,194 --> 00:21:23,821
If it makes you feel any better...

280
00:21:23,904 --> 00:21:26,824
I didn't know Shaw was the fiance
when Adam plopped.

281
00:21:26,907 --> 00:21:30,077
What do you mean you didn't know?
How could you not know?

282
00:21:35,499 --> 00:21:37,376
I wanted Adam to learn from Shaw...

283
00:21:37,459 --> 00:21:39,837
that the Delacroix family
was almost broke...

284
00:21:39,878 --> 00:21:42,798
and desperately waiting
for the grandmother to die.

285
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:45,509
Then I realized,
as soon as Adam heard this...

286
00:21:45,592 --> 00:21:47,469
he'd be worried about his wages.

287
00:21:47,511 --> 00:21:50,597
This was a problem
I hadn't anticipated till I got there.

288
00:21:50,681 --> 00:21:52,308
Then I had the idea.

289
00:21:52,391 --> 00:21:56,478
What if Shaw agreed to loan Polina
the money to cover her expenses?

290
00:21:57,021 --> 00:21:59,857
But why would he do that?
Perhaps he's in love with her.

291
00:21:59,857 --> 00:22:01,358
Shall we continue?

292
00:22:02,735 --> 00:22:06,030
You started having absolutely no idea
what was going to happen...

293
00:22:06,113 --> 00:22:08,866
and then, by pure luck, it just worked out?

294
00:22:09,033 --> 00:22:11,201
I like to think it's more than luck...

295
00:22:11,285 --> 00:22:15,331
but every writer does depend on the
muses smiling down on him occasionally.

296
00:22:15,581 --> 00:22:17,499
And if the muses don't smile?

297
00:22:17,583 --> 00:22:20,210
My head starts ringing
and my eyes fog over.

298
00:22:20,878 --> 00:22:25,257
Is there smiling now or are we heading
back into the fog with the ringing sounds?

299
00:22:25,299 --> 00:22:27,217
- There's smiling.
- Good.

300
00:22:28,344 --> 00:22:31,138
- What happens next?
- Adam falls in love.

301
00:22:32,222 --> 00:22:33,223
With whom?

302
00:22:36,393 --> 00:22:41,148
 There's no accounting for love 
 or why one look, one casual touch...  

303
00:22:41,190 --> 00:22:43,067
 one breath of perfumed air...  

304
00:22:43,192 --> 00:22:46,946
 can ignite feelings so strong 
 it's almost painful.  

305
00:22:47,988 --> 00:22:50,407
 He seems awfully shallow.  

306
00:22:50,574 --> 00:22:54,703
- What are you talking about?
- He just looks at her and he's in love?

307
00:22:55,037 --> 00:22:57,706
You've never heard of love at first sight?

308
00:22:58,707 --> 00:23:00,501
Right. That must be it.

309
00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:03,212
Continuing on.

310
00:23:04,254 --> 00:23:07,508
Polina Delacroix. It's a great pleasure
to meet you, Mr. Shipley.

311
00:23:07,549 --> 00:23:10,719
 -You, as well, Madame Delacroix.  
 -Please, call me Polina.  

312
00:23:14,014 --> 00:23:16,600
- This is John Shaw.
- We've met.

313
00:23:17,268 --> 00:23:18,727
This is Andre and Michele.

314
00:23:20,854 --> 00:23:23,857
We are very pleased to be meeting you,
Mr. Shipley.

315
00:23:23,941 --> 00:23:26,318
Very pleased to be meeting you, too.

316
00:23:26,443 --> 00:23:29,488
Allow me to introduce the others.
This is my father.

317
00:23:29,571 --> 00:23:32,950
 And this is Madame Blanche,  
 a close friend of my father's.  

318
00:23:42,918 --> 00:23:43,961
Let's be off.

319
00:23:44,044 --> 00:23:47,089
Claude, could you please fetch
Mr. Shipley's belongings?

320
00:23:47,214 --> 00:23:50,509
That's okay. I can fetch.
I don't mind fetching. I love to fetch.

321
00:23:50,509 --> 00:23:52,386
Don't be silly, Mr. Shipley.

322
00:23:54,847 --> 00:23:56,682
I wouldn't want to be silly.

323
00:23:56,974 --> 00:23:59,643
I think it's going to be
a very special summer.

324
00:24:10,112 --> 00:24:13,240
- You like that?
- It's very funny.

325
00:24:13,866 --> 00:24:15,117
Thank you.

326
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:19,496
- He's like a fool.
- What? No.

327
00:24:20,539 --> 00:24:22,958
He's smitten. He's blinded by love.

328
00:24:24,460 --> 00:24:25,544
Right.

329
00:24:27,254 --> 00:24:30,049
Because I didn't see the attraction at first.

330
00:24:30,507 --> 00:24:32,843
But when she said
those intoxicating words:

331
00:24:32,885 --> 00:24:36,430
"Claude, could you fetch his belongings,"
who could resist that?

332
00:24:39,308 --> 00:24:40,768
All right. Good.

333
00:24:41,810 --> 00:24:44,939
- What do you say we call it a day?
- Okay.

334
00:24:45,689 --> 00:24:48,817
Good, because I have to type
all this stuff up tonight.

335
00:24:48,859 --> 00:24:51,904
- How many pages we got?
- I'd say about eight.

336
00:24:52,655 --> 00:24:53,948
That's not bad.

337
00:24:54,531 --> 00:24:57,409
Considering the somewhat
awkward beginning.

338
00:25:00,371 --> 00:25:02,331
I guess I'll see you tomorrow.

339
00:25:02,665 --> 00:25:04,959
- I'll be here around 9:00?
- Great.

340
00:25:05,334 --> 00:25:08,212
- Thanks for a good first day.
- You're welcome.

341
00:25:09,546 --> 00:25:11,632
- Bye.
- Bye.

342
00:25:20,349 --> 00:25:22,393
 Saint Charles seemed almost unreal...  

343
00:25:22,518 --> 00:25:25,271
 like a magical playground 
 for the well-to-do.  

344
00:25:25,396 --> 00:25:29,400
 There was, however, something besides 
 the affluence and beauty of Saint Charles...  

345
00:25:29,483 --> 00:25:32,611
 which filled Adam 's brain 
 until he could barely breathe.  

346
00:25:32,695 --> 00:25:37,199
 It was Polina 's perfume and the 
 application thereof upon her ample bosom.  

347
00:25:37,366 --> 00:25:39,368
 -Oh, please!  
 -What?  

348
00:25:39,994 --> 00:25:44,248
- "Ample bosom"?
- What's wrong with that? It's literary.

349
00:25:45,749 --> 00:25:48,627
- In that case, you forgot the heaving.
- The what?

350
00:25:49,128 --> 00:25:53,465
In every book I've read, whenever there's
an ample bosom there's always heaving.

351
00:25:53,590 --> 00:25:57,344
- Do we have to talk about this right now?
- You introduced the bosoms.

352
00:25:57,428 --> 00:25:59,972
I'm simply asking
if you'd like them to heave.

353
00:26:00,055 --> 00:26:01,849
Fine, let them heave.

354
00:26:04,018 --> 00:26:07,062
 Though he had considered himself 
 a member in good standing...  

355
00:26:07,187 --> 00:26:09,523
 of that great army of destitute artists...  

356
00:26:09,607 --> 00:26:12,026
 upon arriving at the Delacroix estate...  

357
00:26:12,151 --> 00:26:15,154
 Adam began to consider 
 that he may have been a bit hasty...  

358
00:26:15,154 --> 00:26:17,948
 in condemning 
 the acquisition of large sums of money.  

359
00:26:18,073 --> 00:26:21,577
Mr. Shipley, Ylva will help you get settled
in the guest cottage.

360
00:26:21,619 --> 00:26:25,122
 -Ylva? What kind of name is Ylva?  
 -It's Swedish.  

361
00:26:25,581 --> 00:26:29,126
That's not a real name.
Who made that one up? Jacques Cartier?

362
00:26:30,711 --> 00:26:32,338
It's her name, okay?

363
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:35,633
- Okay, how do you spell it?
- Just like it sounds.

364
00:26:36,258 --> 00:26:39,637
- L-L-V-A.
- No, it's Y-L-V-A.

365
00:26:40,638 --> 00:26:44,767
- Y-L-V-A? That's not how it sounds.
- That's how she spells it!

366
00:26:45,100 --> 00:26:48,479
- Okay, you want Y-L-V-A, it's Y-L-V-A.
- Good.

367
00:26:49,146 --> 00:26:53,275
Fine. Just so you know,
it's not how it sounds.

368
00:26:53,859 --> 00:26:57,196
 -Who is she, anyway?  
 -She's this pain-in-the-ass au pair.  

369
00:26:57,404 --> 00:26:59,531
Well, here we are.

370
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:05,663
- Thanks...
- Ylva.

371
00:27:06,246 --> 00:27:09,750
Ylva, now that's a beautiful name.
How do you spell that?

372
00:27:10,167 --> 00:27:12,586
Y-L-V-A.

373
00:27:13,796 --> 00:27:15,297
Just like it sounds.

374
00:27:15,673 --> 00:27:18,676
 -Very funny.  
 -What? I take from life.  

375
00:27:18,968 --> 00:27:20,844
I am to unpack for you.

376
00:27:21,011 --> 00:27:24,848
 -Madame told me to unpack for you.  
 -All right.  

377
00:27:31,522 --> 00:27:33,440
 She seems very nice, Madame.  

378
00:27:35,818 --> 00:27:38,779
Has she been keeping company
with Mr. Shaw very long?

379
00:27:39,446 --> 00:27:41,448
She does not love him.

380
00:27:42,116 --> 00:27:45,577
- Really?
- But she will marry him.

381
00:27:45,661 --> 00:27:46,662
Why?

382
00:27:48,289 --> 00:27:51,292
She is desperate for the money.

383
00:27:52,084 --> 00:27:55,921
I thought she was supposed to receive
a large inheritance from her grandmother.

384
00:27:55,963 --> 00:28:00,384
Yeah, but Grandmother,
she takes a very long time to die.

385
00:28:01,885 --> 00:28:04,263
So if Polina had money...

386
00:28:04,763 --> 00:28:07,141
she wouldn't have to marry Shaw.

387
00:28:07,349 --> 00:28:10,394
I see what you're doing.
You've got the triangle.

388
00:28:10,436 --> 00:28:13,397
We already know Adam and Shaw
both like Polina.

389
00:28:13,439 --> 00:28:16,108
Now we find out they both have obstacles.

390
00:28:16,317 --> 00:28:18,027
Yeah. It's called a plot.

391
00:28:20,154 --> 00:28:22,906
And the reason
you're being sarcastic with me is?

392
00:28:23,866 --> 00:28:28,162
Because if I don't finish this book
in 28 days, two large Cuban gentlemen...

393
00:28:28,245 --> 00:28:31,498
are going to see to it
that I'm not around to enjoy a 29th.

394
00:28:32,541 --> 00:28:36,003
Fine. Except for the typing, I'm not here.

395
00:28:37,588 --> 00:28:40,466
Why do I think
that will never be altogether true?

396
00:28:41,258 --> 00:28:44,637
 As Adam settled into his routine 
 at the Delacroix estate...  

397
00:28:44,762 --> 00:28:46,430
 he knew he had a job to do.  

398
00:28:46,472 --> 00:28:50,142
 Teach those children English 
 like they'd never been taught before.  

399
00:28:50,434 --> 00:28:53,395
 Focus. He had to focus.  

400
00:28:54,855 --> 00:28:56,315
 Who was he kidding?  

401
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:59,401
 There'd be no focusing 
 with Polina on the premises.  

402
00:28:59,944 --> 00:29:02,279
 On Tuesday,  
 he caught a glimpse of her ankle...  

403
00:29:02,363 --> 00:29:05,616
 and was forced back to his room 
 for prayer and reflection.  

404
00:29:06,367 --> 00:29:08,619
 Adam wondered: was it possible?  

405
00:29:08,827 --> 00:29:11,580
 Could a woman like Polina 
 actually be interested...  

406
00:29:11,664 --> 00:29:13,916
 in an ordinary man like himself?  

407
00:29:14,166 --> 00:29:18,212
 Why not? This wasn't India.  
 There was no caste system here.  

408
00:29:18,462 --> 00:29:22,299
 This was America, where everybody 
 had a shot with everybody.  

409
00:29:23,342 --> 00:29:24,802
 There was no denying it.  

410
00:29:24,843 --> 00:29:28,931
 Her feelings for Adam 
 were as real as the egg salad in his lap.  

411
00:29:30,057 --> 00:29:32,476
It was another glorious day
in Saint Charles...

412
00:29:32,601 --> 00:29:34,603
as Adam chased Andre and Michele...

413
00:29:34,687 --> 00:29:37,773
who giggled as they conjugated the verb
"to run."

414
00:29:38,065 --> 00:29:39,108
I run.

415
00:29:39,149 --> 00:29:40,693
You run! He run!

416
00:29:40,776 --> 00:29:43,320
No, "run." We run. You run.

417
00:29:43,654 --> 00:29:44,905
They run.

418
00:29:49,076 --> 00:29:51,787
No, you do not run.
You go wash your hands.

419
00:29:53,789 --> 00:29:56,125
 I have finished mit der strudel.  

420
00:29:56,292 --> 00:29:58,294
 Wait a minute. Who's she?  

421
00:29:58,669 --> 00:30:00,296
Elsa, the au pair.

422
00:30:00,546 --> 00:30:02,798
I thought Ylva was the au pair.

423
00:30:03,048 --> 00:30:05,259
I didn't have a real fix on the character.

424
00:30:05,384 --> 00:30:08,220
The Swedish wasn't working for me.
She needs more edge.

425
00:30:08,178 --> 00:30:09,930
Swedes have no edge?

426
00:30:10,055 --> 00:30:13,517
No. It's common knowledge.
They got that light blue flag.

427
00:30:13,559 --> 00:30:15,519
It's better if she's German.

428
00:30:15,561 --> 00:30:18,230
Of course, because all Germans have edge.

429
00:30:18,314 --> 00:30:21,525
No, not all. But some, certainly.

430
00:30:22,693 --> 00:30:24,737
I mean, Hitler springs to mind.

431
00:30:25,404 --> 00:30:26,739
Fine, she's German.

432
00:30:26,905 --> 00:30:27,990
Thank you, Elsa.

433
00:30:28,032 --> 00:30:30,367
Would you be so kind
as to take the children?

434
00:30:30,367 --> 00:30:33,037
- I must speak with Mr. Shipley.
- Yes, of course.

435
00:30:33,162 --> 00:30:36,040
Let's go! Wash hands. On to the house!

436
00:30:37,291 --> 00:30:40,252
Our family is in something of a crisis.

437
00:30:40,753 --> 00:30:42,212
Yes, I've heard.

438
00:30:45,049 --> 00:30:47,051
What a disaster it all is.

439
00:30:47,885 --> 00:30:50,721
 Hearing his name from her lips 
 for the first time...  

440
00:30:50,763 --> 00:30:53,015
 was almost more than he could bear.  

441
00:30:53,057 --> 00:30:56,518
Children shouldn't have to
deal with burdens like this.

442
00:30:56,894 --> 00:30:59,647
I'll do my best
to see that they're protected.

443
00:30:59,730 --> 00:31:03,317
- I want to see them happy.
- I'll make sure they're happy.

444
00:31:03,734 --> 00:31:07,821
All I want is a simple life,
and a man to share it with.

445
00:31:09,156 --> 00:31:11,909
A man who will truly love me for me.

446
00:31:13,577 --> 00:31:15,537
Is that too much to ask?

447
00:31:15,996 --> 00:31:19,124
I think that's very reasonable.

448
00:31:22,086 --> 00:31:23,921
Would you kill for me?

449
00:31:24,588 --> 00:31:28,217
- I beg your pardon?
- Would you kill Shaw for me?

450
00:31:29,969 --> 00:31:31,637
You want me to...

451
00:31:33,764 --> 00:31:35,057
kill Shaw?

452
00:31:35,933 --> 00:31:37,810
I owe him so much money.

453
00:31:37,893 --> 00:31:41,272
And if he lives, I will have to marry him.

454
00:31:45,109 --> 00:31:48,028
I'd kill him in a second, you understand.

455
00:31:48,946 --> 00:31:50,781
It's just that...

456
00:31:53,409 --> 00:31:58,289
when you're a tutor, and people
see the word "murderer" on your resume...

457
00:31:58,372 --> 00:32:01,625
sometimes they have a tough time
getting past that.

458
00:32:06,088 --> 00:32:07,965
I'm teasing, of course.

459
00:32:09,258 --> 00:32:11,218
 It was then that Adam realized...  

460
00:32:11,302 --> 00:32:14,763
 that all that stood between him 
 and the perfection of Polina 's arms...  

461
00:32:14,847 --> 00:32:16,849
 was inexhaustible wealth.  

462
00:32:17,308 --> 00:32:20,644
- What is it with guys like Adam?
- What do you mean?

463
00:32:20,978 --> 00:32:24,398
Do they really like being driven crazy
by women like Polina?

464
00:32:24,481 --> 00:32:26,900
They're like lemmings
running into the sea.

465
00:32:26,984 --> 00:32:29,445
They can't wait to be drowning
in their own misery.

466
00:32:29,528 --> 00:32:32,823
If they're not in agony,
then it can't be love!

467
00:32:33,198 --> 00:32:35,284
Why do men want women like that?

468
00:32:35,367 --> 00:32:38,621
Maybe you're not picturing Polina
the way I'm picturing her.

469
00:32:38,704 --> 00:32:42,666
What? Gorgeous, exciting,
incredibly sexy?

470
00:32:43,417 --> 00:32:44,710
Maybe you are.

471
00:32:44,793 --> 00:32:48,380
That's great for a weekend,
but what will happen in the long run?

472
00:32:48,422 --> 00:32:50,299
What do you mean, like the next weekend?

473
00:32:50,424 --> 00:32:53,802
No. When it's time for the first laundry.

474
00:32:54,887 --> 00:32:56,263
I know.

475
00:32:56,472 --> 00:32:59,141
In great romantic novels,
there's no laundry.

476
00:32:59,141 --> 00:33:01,977
There's people like Ylva or Elsa to do it.

477
00:33:03,854 --> 00:33:06,065
Maybe that's why I like them.

478
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:08,776
They can wash their own clothes.

479
00:33:12,780 --> 00:33:14,323
Okay, where were we?

480
00:33:15,449 --> 00:33:19,703
 Adam needs a fortune so he can 
 live happily ever after with his true love.  

481
00:33:21,747 --> 00:33:24,708
- Who is it?
- Elsa, it's me, Adam.

482
00:33:25,584 --> 00:33:28,003
Mr. Shipley, I'll be right there.

483
00:33:30,589 --> 00:33:32,841
I'm sorry. Am I inconveniencing you?

484
00:33:32,967 --> 00:33:35,386
 No, I was just washing mein hair.  

485
00:33:37,554 --> 00:33:38,806
Come in.

486
00:33:41,517 --> 00:33:43,894
- Won't you sit down?
- I can't stay long.

487
00:33:44,019 --> 00:33:46,021
- Sit down!
- All right.

488
00:33:48,315 --> 00:33:49,984
I'll make you tea.

489
00:33:50,109 --> 00:33:51,902
 -This is good.  
 -What?  

490
00:33:52,027 --> 00:33:55,406
You're creating another triangle:
Polina, Adam, Elsa.

491
00:33:55,739 --> 00:33:59,159
No, she's just someone he can talk to.
He feels comfortable with her.

492
00:33:59,243 --> 00:34:01,036
You know, now that she's German.

493
00:34:01,412 --> 00:34:04,039
I hear there's a casino on the island.

494
00:34:06,166 --> 00:34:09,336
 The General goes there often 
 with Madame Blanche.  

495
00:34:09,461 --> 00:34:11,088
Where is this casino?

496
00:34:11,130 --> 00:34:14,133
Right off the boardwalk,
next to the Regency.

497
00:34:15,426 --> 00:34:17,553
But, Mr. Shipley, you're not thinking...

498
00:34:17,594 --> 00:34:19,930
Elsa, do you believe in destiny?

499
00:34:20,681 --> 00:34:21,932
Destiny?

500
00:34:22,558 --> 00:34:25,644
That a man and a woman
are meant to be together?

501
00:34:30,190 --> 00:34:32,610
But only if they are both ready.

502
00:34:32,943 --> 00:34:35,279
With love, one must be patient.

503
00:34:36,155 --> 00:34:38,782
You must not eat the fruit until it is ripe.

504
00:34:38,782 --> 00:34:41,493
The baby must crawl before he can walk.

505
00:34:41,785 --> 00:34:44,371
The farmer must sow before he can reap.

506
00:34:44,455 --> 00:34:47,041
The butcher must kill before he can...

507
00:34:47,416 --> 00:34:49,627
You struck oil. Stop drilling.

508
00:34:50,252 --> 00:34:52,379
I'm talking about fate here.

509
00:34:52,463 --> 00:34:56,425
When feelings are so powerful,
it's as if some force beyond your control...

510
00:34:56,508 --> 00:34:59,261
is guiding you to someone
who can make you happy...

511
00:34:59,303 --> 00:35:01,388
beyond your wildest dreams.

512
00:35:01,472 --> 00:35:05,351
I never thought I could experience
feelings such as these, until now.

513
00:35:05,476 --> 00:35:10,105
I thought they only existed in story books.
But now I know it can be real.

514
00:35:11,148 --> 00:35:13,275
- It can?
- Yes, Elsa.

515
00:35:16,904 --> 00:35:19,990
And once I have money, my destiny...

516
00:35:20,199 --> 00:35:22,660
Polina shall be mine.

517
00:35:27,498 --> 00:35:30,125
- I am so sorry!
- Maybe if you blow on it!

518
00:35:33,295 --> 00:35:35,130
Will you ever forgive me?

519
00:35:35,172 --> 00:35:37,049
 Why should she ask for forgiveness?  

520
00:35:37,257 --> 00:35:40,636
She poured scalding hot water
on his crotch.

521
00:35:40,719 --> 00:35:43,973
He led her on.
He made her think that he wanted her.

522
00:35:43,973 --> 00:35:46,809
- She misinterpreted.
- No, I don't think so.

523
00:35:47,101 --> 00:35:51,730
Don't tell me Elsa winds up getting hurt,
because that would be so unfair.

524
00:35:51,814 --> 00:35:52,898
I don't know.

525
00:35:52,982 --> 00:35:55,150
Can't always control
what happens to characters.

526
00:35:55,234 --> 00:35:57,987
Sometimes they take you
to unexpected places.

527
00:35:58,070 --> 00:36:01,532
People get hurt in books.
People get hurt in real life.

528
00:36:02,199 --> 00:36:05,661
Adam left a disappointed,
but resilient Elsa, like a...

529
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:12,251
Adam left a disappointed,
but resilient Elsa, like a man on a mission.

530
00:36:12,334 --> 00:36:15,045
A man on a mission with hot, wet balls.

531
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:18,674
Okay, lose the balls.

532
00:36:20,509 --> 00:36:24,138
 Adam entered the edifice that he hoped 
 would transform his life.  

533
00:36:24,221 --> 00:36:27,016
 $200 was all he had to his name.  

534
00:36:27,433 --> 00:36:29,268
 Enough to get him through the summer...  

535
00:36:29,268 --> 00:36:32,062
 but certainly not enough 
 to win a woman like Polina.  

536
00:36:32,771 --> 00:36:35,399
Place your bets, ladies and gentlemen.

537
00:36:37,192 --> 00:36:39,528
 The atmosphere was intoxicating.  

538
00:36:39,653 --> 00:36:43,115
 There was more money 
 than he had ever seen in his life.  

539
00:36:45,993 --> 00:36:47,703
Seventeen, black.

540
00:36:48,746 --> 00:36:50,122
How do I...

541
00:36:54,293 --> 00:36:56,545
Place your bets, ladies and gentlemen.

542
00:36:59,173 --> 00:37:00,924
 His heart beat like a drum.  

543
00:37:00,966 --> 00:37:05,262
 He understood instantly this wasn't 
 a game he would play for his amusement.  

544
00:37:05,304 --> 00:37:07,931
 It meant a lifetime of love with Polina.  

545
00:37:07,931 --> 00:37:10,935
 Every roll, every bounce 
 of that little ivory ball...  

546
00:37:11,018 --> 00:37:13,938
 would bring him 
 one step closer to paradise.  

547
00:37:13,979 --> 00:37:16,231
Zero!

548
00:37:16,357 --> 00:37:19,109
Zero? That's green.
I thought there was only red and black.

549
00:37:19,109 --> 00:37:20,361
There's green?

550
00:37:20,653 --> 00:37:23,656
- So what is that, like a do-over?
- No, you lost.

551
00:37:23,822 --> 00:37:25,908
- I lost?
- You lost.

552
00:37:26,450 --> 00:37:27,660
 He lost.  

553
00:37:27,785 --> 00:37:31,163
 Adam would have to find another route 
 to Polina 's heart.  

554
00:37:31,330 --> 00:37:33,832
And what is so wrong with poverty?

555
00:37:34,541 --> 00:37:37,461
- The voice of the common man.
- No, really.

556
00:37:37,544 --> 00:37:40,839
The proletariat are not as miserable
as they're made out to be.

557
00:37:40,923 --> 00:37:45,260
Wealth does not make for happiness.
It is love which sustains us.

558
00:37:45,302 --> 00:37:47,429
The joy of family. The wonders of nature!

559
00:37:47,554 --> 00:37:50,683
The supreme pleasure of spending life
with someone devoted to you!

560
00:37:50,724 --> 00:37:54,019
And no amount of money
will ever give us these! No amount!

561
00:37:54,144 --> 00:37:56,230
I see you found the casino.

562
00:37:57,439 --> 00:38:01,652
Very interesting concept, Mr. Shipley.
Poverty as an aphrodisiac.

563
00:38:04,071 --> 00:38:07,032
Pay no attention to him.
He's jealous of your purity.

564
00:38:07,116 --> 00:38:10,661
- Yes, I long for insolvency.
- Please, John.

565
00:38:14,373 --> 00:38:15,708
She's dead.

566
00:38:15,749 --> 00:38:19,920
"Grandmother is gone. Stop.
We have closed up the house. Stop.

567
00:38:20,087 --> 00:38:22,131
"Details to follow. Stop."

568
00:38:27,052 --> 00:38:30,097
 Could it be?  
 Money was no longer an obstacle?  

569
00:38:30,556 --> 00:38:33,809
 Polina found herself with feelings 
 she never knew she had.  

570
00:38:33,851 --> 00:38:36,562
 What she assumed would be the answer 
 to her problems...  

571
00:38:36,687 --> 00:38:39,023
 left her with unexpected sorrow.  

572
00:38:39,565 --> 00:38:41,900
Her grandmother had been a kind soul.

573
00:38:42,026 --> 00:38:44,653
Polina was filled
with the loss of the woman...

574
00:38:44,695 --> 00:38:46,739
who had so often held her in her arms...

575
00:38:46,822 --> 00:38:49,742
and comforted her
with her warmth and wisdom.

576
00:38:51,118 --> 00:38:52,536
That's beautiful.

577
00:38:52,786 --> 00:38:56,040
- You don't like it?
- No, I'm saying it's beautiful.

578
00:38:57,583 --> 00:39:00,127
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

579
00:39:05,716 --> 00:39:08,594
- I think that about does it for today.
- Okay.

580
00:39:09,845 --> 00:39:11,180
You know...

581
00:39:12,389 --> 00:39:16,101
- You're not at all like you seemed at first.
- How's that?

582
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:22,900
- At first you seemed kind of like...
- What?

583
00:39:24,735 --> 00:39:27,071
- Kind of a mess.
- A mess.

584
00:39:27,404 --> 00:39:30,950
Yeah. You live like a slob.
You're a hypochondriac.

585
00:39:31,033 --> 00:39:34,161
You're extremely insecure, and you lie.

586
00:39:34,787 --> 00:39:37,373
- Thank you.
- It's true.

587
00:39:40,751 --> 00:39:44,546
But somehow all those qualities combine
to make something...

588
00:39:44,838 --> 00:39:47,174
I don't know. Nice.

589
00:39:47,841 --> 00:39:50,636
I think your qualities combine nice, too.

590
00:39:54,807 --> 00:39:57,184
What do you say
we get an early start tomorrow?

591
00:39:57,226 --> 00:39:59,603
Okay, great. Early.

592
00:40:01,313 --> 00:40:03,524
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- Okay.

593
00:40:19,164 --> 00:40:22,376
Oh, my God! Wait!

594
00:40:23,085 --> 00:40:26,130
All right, honey! It's all right.
Take your time.

595
00:40:26,130 --> 00:40:27,506
Oh, my God!

596
00:40:56,493 --> 00:40:59,163
You said you wanted to get an early start.

597
00:40:59,288 --> 00:41:01,332
My alarm didn't go off.

598
00:41:02,374 --> 00:41:04,960
- What time is it?
- 6:45.

599
00:41:05,711 --> 00:41:08,547
No wonder it didn't go off.
What time did you get up?

600
00:41:08,589 --> 00:41:10,424
Around 5:00. I'm an early person.

601
00:41:10,507 --> 00:41:13,218
Some people are early people,
other people are late people.

602
00:41:13,302 --> 00:41:15,679
What kind of person
would you say you are?

603
00:41:15,721 --> 00:41:17,139
Are you moving in?

604
00:41:17,181 --> 00:41:20,559
- No, I just bought some groceries for us.
- For us?

605
00:41:20,684 --> 00:41:22,144
Well, for me, really.

606
00:41:22,186 --> 00:41:24,271
I can't work
without eating something normal...

607
00:41:24,355 --> 00:41:25,981
but you're welcome to them.

608
00:41:26,065 --> 00:41:30,194
Don't get me wrong.
I like fish sticks and Cap'n Crunch.

609
00:41:30,235 --> 00:41:33,072
- Sorry, I got caught up...
- You don't have to apologize.

610
00:41:33,113 --> 00:41:37,326
You're a creative genius.
You shouldn't worry about food, or eating.

611
00:41:37,409 --> 00:41:40,162
Go take a shower
and I'll make you some breakfast.

612
00:41:40,245 --> 00:41:44,208
No. We don't have time.
We still need at least 150 pages.

613
00:41:44,249 --> 00:41:47,836
We'll eat as we work.
Let's see what we have from yesterday.

614
00:41:48,712 --> 00:41:51,215
Let's go over yesterday
to see where we are.

615
00:41:51,298 --> 00:41:55,678
Why don't we keep going?
Like you said, we don't have a lot of time.

616
00:41:55,719 --> 00:41:59,431
If we keep going over what we've done,
then we won't get...

617
00:42:00,432 --> 00:42:01,684
finished.

618
00:42:12,069 --> 00:42:14,029
"Adam walks through the casino...

619
00:42:14,113 --> 00:42:17,825
"and sees lots of people
sitting around and doing stuff...

620
00:42:17,908 --> 00:42:21,370
"like playing roulette
and drinking booze and yakking."

621
00:42:22,121 --> 00:42:23,789
I thought that...

622
00:42:24,957 --> 00:42:28,210
"Adam liked Polina,
but he also knew she was kind of weird.

623
00:42:28,252 --> 00:42:32,881
"Even though he thought it was love,
it really was that he was hot for her."

624
00:42:33,090 --> 00:42:36,176
- Well, Alex, it's true.
- No, it's not!

625
00:42:36,260 --> 00:42:38,721
He's madly in love with her
the minute he sees her!

626
00:42:38,762 --> 00:42:40,597
Where's what I wrote?

627
00:42:44,226 --> 00:42:46,437
I was getting on the bus.

628
00:42:50,357 --> 00:42:52,401
There was rain...

629
00:42:53,569 --> 00:42:55,696
and a huge puddle.

630
00:42:56,780 --> 00:43:00,326
And my feet just tripped.

631
00:43:01,493 --> 00:43:05,914
And it just spilled. And I'm sorry.
And I tried.

632
00:43:06,540 --> 00:43:09,501
- I tried to fix it!
- It's not your fault.

633
00:43:11,295 --> 00:43:12,421
Yeah, it is.

634
00:43:12,504 --> 00:43:15,883
I'll fix it. I've lost pages before.

635
00:43:15,924 --> 00:43:17,885
- It'll be okay.
- It will?

636
00:43:18,260 --> 00:43:21,430
Yeah, it will be fine.
How many pages got wrecked?

637
00:43:22,139 --> 00:43:23,432
Eighteen.

638
00:43:29,980 --> 00:43:31,482
Time to get up.

639
00:43:32,483 --> 00:43:35,361
 As Polina mourned 
 for her beloved grandmother...  

640
00:43:35,402 --> 00:43:37,655
 and tended to family matters...  

641
00:43:38,197 --> 00:43:41,700
 Adam struggled to keep 
 his feelings for Polina in check.  

642
00:43:41,909 --> 00:43:44,912
Adam's friendship with Elsa
continued to grow.

643
00:43:45,037 --> 00:43:47,873
Unaware of the deeper feelings
she held for him...

644
00:43:47,957 --> 00:43:52,044
he regaled her with stories
of the exciting life he'd share with Polina.

645
00:43:52,169 --> 00:43:55,798
Adam's passions
continued to rage out of control.

646
00:43:56,173 --> 00:43:58,926
With his beloved Red Sox
well out of contention...

647
00:43:59,051 --> 00:44:00,886
for the American League pennant...

648
00:44:00,970 --> 00:44:04,014
baseball no longer provided
a viable diversion.

649
00:44:04,264 --> 00:44:06,725
Shaw was not to be underestimated.

650
00:44:06,850 --> 00:44:08,936
Despite the insubstantial mustache...

651
00:44:09,019 --> 00:44:11,730
he'd proven himself to be a formidable foe.

652
00:44:12,147 --> 00:44:14,233
Adam knew that all too well.

653
00:44:14,566 --> 00:44:17,152
He had to make his move. But when?

654
00:44:22,324 --> 00:44:24,743
- Can I?
- Sure. Go ahead.

655
00:44:25,119 --> 00:44:26,704
I'm formulating.

656
00:44:39,133 --> 00:44:41,176
I don't like tomato skins.

657
00:44:44,013 --> 00:44:45,389
Who are you?

658
00:44:46,515 --> 00:44:47,599
What?

659
00:44:47,766 --> 00:44:50,728
We've been in this room
for over three weeks.

660
00:44:50,978 --> 00:44:54,565
Besides the fact that you have an opinion
for everything I do...

661
00:44:54,690 --> 00:44:58,569
and an odd way of eating pizza,
I don't know anything about you.

662
00:44:59,111 --> 00:45:01,905
Where are you from?
What have you been doing with your life?

663
00:45:01,947 --> 00:45:04,742
Do you have friends?
A boyfriend? Parents?

664
00:45:05,075 --> 00:45:07,911
- It's my personal life, Alex.
- I know.

665
00:45:08,579 --> 00:45:11,498
And if you don't feel like sharing,
I completely understand.

666
00:45:11,582 --> 00:45:14,418
I live in Jamaica Plain.
Both my parents are dead.

667
00:45:14,543 --> 00:45:17,838
My mother died six years ago.
My father left when we were very young.

668
00:45:17,880 --> 00:45:20,299
I heard he drank himself to death.

669
00:45:20,549 --> 00:45:23,636
Like I said, if you don't feel like sharing...

670
00:45:28,766 --> 00:45:32,019
Did you mention
whether or not you have a boyfriend?

671
00:45:32,603 --> 00:45:33,896
I didn't.

672
00:45:34,146 --> 00:45:37,733
- Do you think you will mention it?
- Maybe.

673
00:45:39,026 --> 00:45:41,528
Do you think you'll mention it now?

674
00:45:42,529 --> 00:45:44,406
I do have a boyfriend.

675
00:45:45,366 --> 00:45:47,826
And I met him last year...

676
00:45:49,036 --> 00:45:50,663
at a hockey game.

677
00:45:53,749 --> 00:45:57,294
Is it serious
or is it just one of those hockey romances?

678
00:45:58,462 --> 00:46:01,340
We're planning on getting married
next June.

679
00:46:04,802 --> 00:46:07,304
I think I'm about done formulating.

680
00:46:08,180 --> 00:46:09,598
Where was I?

681
00:46:10,724 --> 00:46:13,435
Adam was deciding
when to make his move.

682
00:46:15,145 --> 00:46:16,772
 Adam could wait no longer.  

683
00:46:16,855 --> 00:46:20,150
 He felt like a kid who had finished 
 counting in hide-and-go-seek.  

684
00:46:20,234 --> 00:46:22,236
 It was now, "Ready or not, here I come. " 

685
00:46:22,319 --> 00:46:26,448
 Yet still, his overture must not appear 
 insensitive or indelicate.  

686
00:46:29,702 --> 00:46:33,872
 -Wait a minute. What are they doing?  
 -What does it look like they're doing?  

687
00:46:33,956 --> 00:46:36,000
- Just like that?
- Why not?

688
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,919
- Her grandmother just died.
- Exactly.

689
00:46:40,337 --> 00:46:41,880
She's looking for comfort.

690
00:46:41,964 --> 00:46:45,509
I thought you said
Adam was going to be sensitive to her.

691
00:46:45,801 --> 00:46:47,720
You're right. I did.

692
00:46:48,762 --> 00:46:51,598
I am so sorry that your grandmother died.

693
00:46:54,560 --> 00:46:56,145
 It just isn't right like this.  

694
00:46:56,228 --> 00:46:59,648
- Are you nuts? It's fabulous like this.
- No, it's not.

695
00:46:59,773 --> 00:47:02,818
- Yes, it is.
- No, it's not.

696
00:47:04,194 --> 00:47:08,365
Look, I'm the writer, okay?
And I'm saying it is.

697
00:47:08,449 --> 00:47:11,952
And I'm the reader, okay?
And I'm saying this is really bothering me.

698
00:47:12,077 --> 00:47:16,665
I'm trying very hard to like Adam,
and you're making it extremely difficult.

699
00:47:17,082 --> 00:47:18,584
You know what?

700
00:47:19,168 --> 00:47:20,377
This isn't about Adam.

701
00:47:20,377 --> 00:47:22,838
You've had it in for Polina
since the beginning.

702
00:47:22,921 --> 00:47:24,381
- Please!
- You have.

703
00:47:24,381 --> 00:47:27,301
I do not have it in for a fictional character.

704
00:47:28,135 --> 00:47:31,597
She's flighty. She's flirty.
She's a flawed character.

705
00:47:31,889 --> 00:47:36,060
Of course! The three fluhs:
flighty, flirty and flawed.

706
00:47:36,101 --> 00:47:39,772
Yes. And clearly,
if he's chasing after someone like her...

707
00:47:39,855 --> 00:47:43,275
- He's sitting on some pretty major issues.
- Really?

708
00:47:43,609 --> 00:47:47,029
She's the hottest girl on the island
by a factor of 10!

709
00:47:47,071 --> 00:47:49,907
So maybe he's not the one
with the issues.

710
00:47:50,824 --> 00:47:52,201
What is that supposed to mean?

711
00:47:52,242 --> 00:47:55,454
He's not the one who values propriety
over passion.

712
00:47:58,415 --> 00:48:01,085
- Are you saying I don't believe in passion?
- No.

713
00:48:01,126 --> 00:48:04,838
I'm sure you do,
just so long as the laundry is done first.

714
00:48:07,591 --> 00:48:11,428
Adam and Polina
tumbled passionately into bed.

715
00:48:19,061 --> 00:48:21,689
Boy! Now you're talking!

716
00:48:27,111 --> 00:48:29,071
This is a great island!

717
00:48:29,321 --> 00:48:30,406
What?

718
00:48:47,965 --> 00:48:49,383
I'm exhausted.

719
00:48:51,760 --> 00:48:53,554
I bet you are.

720
00:48:56,307 --> 00:48:57,975
Okay, so now what?

721
00:48:59,059 --> 00:49:00,686
What do you mean?

722
00:49:00,853 --> 00:49:03,814
Grandmother is dead.
Everything's worked out for our lovebirds.

723
00:49:03,897 --> 00:49:07,860
Polina has her money. Adam has Polina.
Shaw goes away.

724
00:49:08,193 --> 00:49:09,820
Now what happens?

725
00:49:12,948 --> 00:49:14,283
I have to vomit.

726
00:49:17,369 --> 00:49:20,164
You have no place to go from here,
do you?

727
00:49:20,456 --> 00:49:23,083
You've written yourself into a corner.

728
00:49:28,047 --> 00:49:30,382
You're supposed to put your head
over the toilet.

729
00:49:30,507 --> 00:49:34,470
I've been vomiting since I was six.
I believe I can handle it.

730
00:49:34,762 --> 00:49:37,348
- I think I'm dying.
- You're not dying.

731
00:49:37,848 --> 00:49:42,102
No, really. I'm burning up. I feel real bad.

732
00:49:45,230 --> 00:49:47,024
You're not that warm.

733
00:49:47,942 --> 00:49:51,904
Why does everyone just tacitly accept
the-hand-to-the-forehead test...

734
00:49:51,987 --> 00:49:54,114
as being medically reliable?

735
00:49:54,156 --> 00:49:55,157
You're fine.

736
00:49:55,282 --> 00:49:58,160
I've got a pain in my chest.
This could be serious.

737
00:49:59,954 --> 00:50:01,246
If these symptoms persist...

738
00:50:01,330 --> 00:50:03,499
and you think
you're having a heart attack...

739
00:50:03,707 --> 00:50:05,584
now this is important...

740
00:50:05,960 --> 00:50:07,962
I want you to call me immediately.

741
00:50:07,962 --> 00:50:12,299
There's no point in my wasting bus fare
if you're just going to be dead.

742
00:50:12,383 --> 00:50:14,134
Have a nice evening.

743
00:50:21,392 --> 00:50:23,602
What are you saying? You're still blocked?

744
00:50:23,602 --> 00:50:24,770
Totally.

745
00:50:24,979 --> 00:50:26,605
Who said it better than you?

746
00:50:26,605 --> 00:50:28,899
Grandmother's dead.
Polina's got the money.

747
00:50:29,024 --> 00:50:31,860
Adam's got Polina,
and I've got nowhere to go.

748
00:50:31,902 --> 00:50:34,071
You're not going to vomit again, are you?

749
00:50:34,280 --> 00:50:36,949
- I've got to get out of here.
- Where are you going?

750
00:50:37,074 --> 00:50:39,660
We don't have much time left.
Shouldn't we keep working?

751
00:50:39,660 --> 00:50:41,620
- This is working.
- It is?

752
00:50:41,662 --> 00:50:45,165
When I get stuck, I need
to get my mind off things for a while.

753
00:50:45,291 --> 00:50:47,918
I need to look at birds, trees,
people doing things...

754
00:50:48,085 --> 00:50:51,171
like throwing Frisbees, rollerblading,
that kind of thing.

755
00:50:51,213 --> 00:50:53,340
Good. Once you clear your mind,
you'll realize...

756
00:50:53,549 --> 00:50:55,968
he shouldn't have jumped into bed
with her like that.

757
00:50:57,720 --> 00:51:00,514
I wanted to be a writer
for as long as I can remember.

758
00:51:00,764 --> 00:51:02,558
My parents got divorced when I was eight.

759
00:51:02,599 --> 00:51:05,185
I started writing stories
as a place to put my feelings.

760
00:51:05,185 --> 00:51:07,813
I found it was easier
to have characters say things...

761
00:51:07,813 --> 00:51:09,648
than to say them myself.

762
00:51:09,815 --> 00:51:12,818
That's the beauty of writing.
You can have things work out...

763
00:51:12,860 --> 00:51:15,487
the way they never seem to in real life.

764
00:51:15,613 --> 00:51:19,283
- Sometimes things work out in life.
- I'm all for it.

765
00:51:20,242 --> 00:51:23,704
- Have you ever been married?
- In real life? No.

766
00:51:24,038 --> 00:51:25,164
Let me guess.

767
00:51:25,247 --> 00:51:28,334
- You just haven't met the right woman.
- Exactly.

768
00:51:28,667 --> 00:51:30,252
I know what you're going to say:

769
00:51:30,252 --> 00:51:34,173
You have to be the right man
in order to meet the right woman.

770
00:51:35,257 --> 00:51:38,552
But I know in my heart
that I am the right man...

771
00:51:38,594 --> 00:51:41,138
and that the perfect woman is out there.

772
00:51:41,347 --> 00:51:44,600
Someone who's smart,
funny, and beautiful.

773
00:51:46,310 --> 00:51:49,396
And here's the tricky part:
interested in me.

774
00:51:51,941 --> 00:51:55,069
I know she's out there.
I just can't seem to...

775
00:51:56,737 --> 00:51:59,657
I feel like one of those greyhounds
at the dog track.

776
00:51:59,782 --> 00:52:03,077
You know, chasing the mechanical rabbit?
I get so close...

777
00:52:04,203 --> 00:52:06,872
but I can never quite seem to catch it.

778
00:52:07,623 --> 00:52:10,376
- They never do.
- I know.

779
00:52:12,044 --> 00:52:14,463
Maybe you don't want to catch it.

780
00:53:09,059 --> 00:53:11,145
- I hope today helped.
- It did.

781
00:53:11,478 --> 00:53:13,897
Things are starting to percolate.

782
00:53:15,107 --> 00:53:17,234
- I had a great time.
- Me, too.

783
00:53:19,528 --> 00:53:20,779
This is it.

784
00:53:33,334 --> 00:53:35,294
I got it!

785
00:53:35,794 --> 00:53:36,712
What?

786
00:53:36,754 --> 00:53:39,673
I never should have had
the grandmother die.

787
00:53:39,965 --> 00:53:43,302
This is great! Thank you!

788
00:53:45,012 --> 00:53:46,388
I love you!

789
00:53:47,181 --> 00:53:49,475
- You know what I mean.
- Yeah.

790
00:53:50,017 --> 00:53:51,727
- This is great.
- Great.

791
00:53:51,852 --> 00:53:55,397
All right. I'll see you tomorrow.
The grandmother lives!

792
00:53:55,856 --> 00:53:58,317
Look who is alive!

793
00:53:59,652 --> 00:54:01,946
The telegram said you were gone.

794
00:54:02,029 --> 00:54:04,114
Well, of course I was gone.

795
00:54:06,283 --> 00:54:10,871
If I was not gone from there,
how could I be here?

796
00:54:11,330 --> 00:54:15,250
Weren't you worried taking such
an arduous trip considering your health?

797
00:54:15,334 --> 00:54:17,670
My health is fine.

798
00:54:17,920 --> 00:54:20,714
Those stupid doctors, all idiots.

799
00:54:20,714 --> 00:54:24,760
They should have their licenses revoked.
Every last one of them!

800
00:54:25,135 --> 00:54:28,597
First, they gave me a year to live...

801
00:54:28,973 --> 00:54:31,976
then it became six months.

802
00:54:32,184 --> 00:54:34,645
Then less than a month.

803
00:54:35,229 --> 00:54:36,563
To listen to them...

804
00:54:36,605 --> 00:54:40,276
I'd be dead 10 minutes after I got here!

805
00:54:49,660 --> 00:54:50,869
What are you doing?

806
00:54:50,869 --> 00:54:53,080
The dead grandmother
is what got you stuck.

807
00:54:53,122 --> 00:54:54,832
now she's dead again?

808
00:54:56,250 --> 00:54:57,835
no money at all?

809
00:54:58,085 --> 00:55:02,339
Your mother had the most extraordinary
collection of rare perfumes...

810
00:55:02,506 --> 00:55:05,467
in the history of France. Worth a fortune.

811
00:55:05,884 --> 00:55:09,805
As you know, your mother,
God rest her soul, made it to 90.

812
00:55:10,347 --> 00:55:13,142
- Sadly, the perfumes did not.
- What?

813
00:55:13,183 --> 00:55:14,935
They all evaporated.

814
00:55:15,185 --> 00:55:18,606
The last of it,
during her brief struggle with scurvy.

815
00:55:18,981 --> 00:55:23,110
Your mother's fortune has evaporated?

816
00:55:23,360 --> 00:55:24,778
Every penny of it?

817
00:55:25,195 --> 00:55:26,655
She had scurvy?

818
00:55:26,989 --> 00:55:30,618
 Upon hearing Grandmother's money 
 had gone the way of all Chanel...  

819
00:55:30,618 --> 00:55:32,453
 Adam pondered his fate.  

820
00:55:32,620 --> 00:55:36,332
 He was no fool.  
 He was a tutor, for God's sake.  

821
00:55:37,082 --> 00:55:39,084
 He knew it was a matter of time...  

822
00:55:39,084 --> 00:55:43,047
 before Polina would find herself 
 once again in the arms of his rival...  

823
00:55:43,255 --> 00:55:45,215
 the odious John Shaw.  

824
00:55:45,257 --> 00:55:48,427
 He pondered the engagement.  
 He pondered the wedding.  

825
00:55:48,469 --> 00:55:50,304
 Then he pondered the wedding night.  

826
00:55:50,304 --> 00:55:53,932
 It was at that point he realized 
 maybe he should stop pondering.  

827
00:55:57,937 --> 00:56:00,648
 Senor Shipley, you must try to forget her.  

828
00:56:00,731 --> 00:56:02,608
Here, have some paella.

829
00:56:04,193 --> 00:56:05,152
What?

830
00:56:07,780 --> 00:56:11,325
Eldora, the Spanish au pair,
who was Elsa, the German au pair...

831
00:56:11,408 --> 00:56:13,452
who was Ylva, the Swedish au pair?

832
00:56:13,577 --> 00:56:16,121
no. Alex, absolutely not.

833
00:56:16,622 --> 00:56:20,292
Even if Eldora was the greatest character
since Scarlet O'Hara...

834
00:56:20,417 --> 00:56:24,880
which seems like a long shot,
we don't have time to change everything.

835
00:56:24,922 --> 00:56:28,300
- I know, but...
- Three days! We have three days.

836
00:56:28,425 --> 00:56:29,969
I know, but something's missing.

837
00:56:30,052 --> 00:56:33,180
Maybe he needs another obstacle
to keep him from Polina.

838
00:56:33,263 --> 00:56:35,808
He's broke. She's marrying another man...

839
00:56:35,891 --> 00:56:39,770
and she doesn't even love him.
I think he has enough obstacles.

840
00:56:40,271 --> 00:56:41,855
Wait. I got it.

841
00:56:41,897 --> 00:56:44,066
It's not an obstacle,
it's the second triangle.

842
00:56:44,108 --> 00:56:47,569
You were right about that.
This can work. The changes will be easy.

843
00:56:47,736 --> 00:56:51,365
She's an American from Philadelphia,
and her name is Anna.

844
00:57:03,377 --> 00:57:04,795
Hello, Adam.

845
00:57:07,798 --> 00:57:08,882
What?

846
00:57:09,425 --> 00:57:13,470
You seem different today, Anna.
Did you do something to your hair?

847
00:57:14,221 --> 00:57:17,057
 There was something in Anna 's eyes 
 that Adam, until now...  

848
00:57:17,266 --> 00:57:20,185
 blinded by his love for Polina, hadn't seen.  

849
00:57:20,477 --> 00:57:23,355
 A deep sadness,  
 combined with a quiet strength...  

850
00:57:23,397 --> 00:57:25,608
 that made her seem incredibly beautiful.  

851
00:57:25,691 --> 00:57:27,610
 Are you sure you want to do this?  

852
00:57:27,693 --> 00:57:28,694
Absolutely.

853
00:57:28,902 --> 00:57:31,947
It's not very attractive.
He's just rebounding.

854
00:57:31,989 --> 00:57:33,365
no, he's not.

855
00:57:33,949 --> 00:57:36,035
Rebounding like a wild man.

856
00:57:36,535 --> 00:57:39,747
What are you talking about?
This is the triangle heating up.

857
00:57:39,955 --> 00:57:43,125
Anna has feelings for him.
He has feelings for her.

858
00:57:43,167 --> 00:57:44,877
But he also has feelings for Polina.

859
00:57:44,960 --> 00:57:47,755
This way, the reader doesn't know
who he'll wind up with.

860
00:57:47,755 --> 00:57:49,214
You hook them in.

861
00:57:49,340 --> 00:57:51,842
- Who does he end up with?
- See? Hooked.

862
00:57:52,384 --> 00:57:54,803
What do you say we head into town?

863
00:57:56,013 --> 00:57:57,931
- I have to...
- You don't have to do anything.

864
00:57:58,015 --> 00:58:01,727
You're making stew. That's why
they call it stew. You let it stew.

865
00:58:02,603 --> 00:58:06,023
Come on. Live a little.
I'll buy you lunch. Are you hungry?

866
00:58:06,273 --> 00:58:07,191
not really.

867
00:58:07,232 --> 00:58:10,402
- Perfect. I don't have any money.
- Sounds good.

868
00:58:11,487 --> 00:58:13,822
How did you come to work
for the Delacroixs?

869
00:58:13,864 --> 00:58:18,369
I answered an ad for a job five years ago.
I've been with them ever since.

870
00:58:18,869 --> 00:58:22,122
Summers in Saint Charles,
winters in Switzerland...

871
00:58:22,289 --> 00:58:25,793
- And the rest of the year in Paris.
- It sounds exciting.

872
00:58:26,502 --> 00:58:27,628
Yeah.

873
00:58:27,711 --> 00:58:30,005
now that didn't sound exciting.

874
00:58:30,506 --> 00:58:32,633
I'm living their life, not mine.

875
00:58:37,137 --> 00:58:40,182
- Maybe we can do something about that.
- What?

876
00:58:41,809 --> 00:58:45,646
I'm just spitballing here,
but how about this?

877
00:58:58,242 --> 00:59:00,035
I like living my life.

878
00:59:00,035 --> 00:59:04,665
 While those of a cynical nature might 
 think that Adam was on the rebound...  

879
00:59:04,832 --> 00:59:06,083
 Cute.  

880
00:59:06,667 --> 00:59:09,253
 ... the truth is 
 that he found comfort in Anna.  

881
00:59:11,088 --> 00:59:15,009
 And with each passing day,  
 his feelings for her grew stronger.  

882
00:59:17,928 --> 00:59:20,848
It's so interesting
watching this process unfold.

883
00:59:20,931 --> 00:59:24,101
I didn't understand when you said
the characters would lead you.

884
00:59:24,143 --> 00:59:28,397
But now it's so clear why Anna and Adam
would end up together all this time.

885
00:59:28,564 --> 00:59:31,775
They've been so close to each other
without seeing what they had.

886
00:59:31,775 --> 00:59:33,611
Who says they'll wind up together?

887
00:59:33,777 --> 00:59:35,195
They're not?

888
00:59:35,404 --> 00:59:36,405
I don't know.

889
00:59:36,572 --> 00:59:39,617
How could they not end up together
after they were so romantic?

890
00:59:39,617 --> 00:59:41,160
That's exactly the point.

891
00:59:41,243 --> 00:59:45,748
If he's crazy about one, but lukewarm
about the other, where's your triangle?

892
00:59:45,831 --> 00:59:49,793
But if he feels equally strong
about both women, that's a real dilemma.

893
00:59:49,835 --> 00:59:51,170
- But then you have...
- No.

894
00:59:51,420 --> 00:59:53,672
now we've got to stir things up a little.

895
00:59:54,089 --> 00:59:56,467
Shipley, how goes it, my good man?

896
00:59:56,467 --> 00:59:59,094
You're certainly in a good mood today,
old bean.

897
00:59:59,136 --> 01:00:00,095
Why not?

898
01:00:00,262 --> 01:00:03,641
Tonight, I shall ask Polina
for her hand in marriage...

899
01:00:03,682 --> 01:00:07,770
and by the week's end, we'll be off to Paris
to prepare for the wedding.

900
01:00:08,103 --> 01:00:09,396
Tonight?

901
01:00:10,731 --> 01:00:12,191
Congratulations.

902
01:00:12,733 --> 01:00:14,318
You're sure she'll accept?

903
01:00:14,360 --> 01:00:17,363
I have 500,000 reasons that say she will.

904
01:00:17,988 --> 01:00:19,573
Five hundred thousand.

905
01:00:20,950 --> 01:00:25,037
- That's a lot of reasons.
- The lovely Polina has expensive tastes.

906
01:00:28,415 --> 01:00:30,834
 Adam thought he had gotten over Polina.  

907
01:00:31,001 --> 01:00:34,838
 But the imminence of her betrothal 
 made one thing abundantly clear.  

908
01:00:34,838 --> 01:00:37,383
 It was time to start pondering again.  

909
01:00:37,466 --> 01:00:41,470
 How does one choose 
 between two women one loves so dearly?  

910
01:00:41,887 --> 01:00:45,724
One pulls one's head out of one's ass
and realizes the obvious.

911
01:00:45,766 --> 01:00:47,559
What we have is substantial.

912
01:00:48,477 --> 01:00:51,480
When you lie in bed at night,
is that what you dream of...

913
01:00:51,480 --> 01:00:53,440
something substantial?

914
01:00:53,899 --> 01:00:57,695
Or do you dream of glamour, excitement...

915
01:00:57,903 --> 01:00:59,655
a life of adventure?

916
01:01:00,114 --> 01:01:03,033
- Dreams are often only that.
- Excuse me?

917
01:01:03,117 --> 01:01:05,911
I am just saying
our love is based on something real.

918
01:01:05,953 --> 01:01:09,707
It's based on caring, understanding,
and mutual respect.

919
01:01:10,124 --> 01:01:14,503
You left out that you gave him
the wildest, most passionate sex...

920
01:01:14,586 --> 01:01:16,213
he's ever experienced.

921
01:01:16,797 --> 01:01:18,257
Wait. That was me.

922
01:01:19,008 --> 01:01:20,884
 He was wracked with confusion.  

923
01:01:21,010 --> 01:01:22,344
 For the first time in his life...  

924
01:01:22,386 --> 01:01:26,015
 he understood the true meaning 
 of the expressions, "horns of a dilemma "... 

925
01:01:26,223 --> 01:01:28,601
 and "between a rock and a hard place." 

926
01:01:28,642 --> 01:01:31,145
 Although the concept 
 of "paying through the nose"... 

927
01:01:31,228 --> 01:01:32,479
 had always tormented him.  

928
01:01:32,646 --> 01:01:35,024
 How does the money get in the nose 
 in the first place?  

929
01:01:35,065 --> 01:01:38,319
 Once in, is it pulled out by hand 
 or is a sneeze involved?  

930
01:01:38,694 --> 01:01:40,863
 Who would accept such a transaction?  

931
01:01:40,904 --> 01:01:44,158
 Burning questions all,  
 but he had bigger fish to fry.  

932
01:01:44,533 --> 01:01:47,244
What do you have to think about?
I'm here.

933
01:01:47,745 --> 01:01:50,539
I'm in love with you
and she's not even available.

934
01:01:50,539 --> 01:01:51,749
I could be.

935
01:01:52,124 --> 01:01:55,127
Yes, for $500,000...

936
01:01:55,127 --> 01:01:57,796
which you don't have.

937
01:01:57,921 --> 01:02:02,051
A small obstacle for a great man.
A small obstacle for a great life.

938
01:02:02,968 --> 01:02:04,219
I need money.

939
01:02:04,345 --> 01:02:05,346
Oh, no!

940
01:02:05,387 --> 01:02:07,681
Good. That's exactly the reaction I want.

941
01:02:07,806 --> 01:02:09,558
I want the reader to be surprised.

942
01:02:09,558 --> 01:02:11,852
Do you want the reader to hit you
with the book?

943
01:02:12,019 --> 01:02:12,978
Think like a writer.

944
01:02:13,020 --> 01:02:15,522
There's more to play with.
Where does he get the money?

945
01:02:15,648 --> 01:02:17,816
You got the ticking clock
with Shaw's proposal.

946
01:02:17,816 --> 01:02:20,444
You still don't know
who he's going to wind up with.

947
01:02:20,653 --> 01:02:23,155
If he makes a play for Polina and loses...

948
01:02:23,197 --> 01:02:25,366
Anna would be an idiot to take him back.

949
01:02:25,449 --> 01:02:26,742
I don't know.

950
01:02:26,867 --> 01:02:31,288
The human heart is an ethereal web
of contradicting emotions...

951
01:02:32,498 --> 01:02:35,209
impossible to decipher
in all its complexity.

952
01:02:35,542 --> 01:02:37,586
Yeah, an idiot.

953
01:02:38,504 --> 01:02:40,965
Okay, good. Can we...

954
01:02:41,131 --> 01:02:43,842
Although his feelings for Anna
were undeniable...

955
01:02:44,134 --> 01:02:47,471
his feelings for Polina
were slightly more undeniable.

956
01:02:49,181 --> 01:02:51,767
 In the course of the summer 
 on Saint Charles...  

957
01:02:51,767 --> 01:02:53,852
 he had made many acquaintances...  

958
01:02:53,978 --> 01:02:56,063
 some more savory than others.  

959
01:02:56,188 --> 01:02:57,982
Do you dance the flamenco?

960
01:02:58,190 --> 01:02:59,233
Well, I...

961
01:02:59,400 --> 01:03:01,652
Because real men dance the flamenco.

962
01:03:02,194 --> 01:03:04,363
Are we loaning money to a real man?

963
01:03:04,405 --> 01:03:07,408
I have been known to flick a castanet
on occasion.

964
01:03:12,663 --> 01:03:13,664
Prove it!

965
01:03:27,511 --> 01:03:29,013
Stay with me, boys.

966
01:03:45,154 --> 01:03:46,322
He's good.

967
01:04:00,002 --> 01:04:03,422
The interest is 200 percent.

968
01:04:04,048 --> 01:04:08,135
We give you $5,000.
In one year, you pay us $15,000.

969
01:04:08,427 --> 01:04:10,554
Two hundred percent? That's outrageous!

970
01:04:10,679 --> 01:04:12,723
 Senor, you are a desperate man.  

971
01:04:12,890 --> 01:04:14,892
You're dancing the flamenco to get money.

972
01:04:14,892 --> 01:04:17,019
This is not a strong bargaining position.

973
01:04:17,102 --> 01:04:19,355
- Two hundred percent.
- I can't!

974
01:04:19,521 --> 01:04:21,732
- Two hundred percent.
- You're thieves.

975
01:04:21,732 --> 01:04:23,233
Take it or leave it.

976
01:04:23,317 --> 01:04:24,818
Okay, 200 percent.

977
01:04:26,946 --> 01:04:29,615
You pay us back in one year or we kill you.

978
01:04:33,160 --> 01:04:35,079
I have $5,000.

979
01:04:35,537 --> 01:04:38,332
Will the casino remove its limit
for me tonight?

980
01:04:44,421 --> 01:04:46,006
 As you wish, monsieur.  

981
01:04:51,637 --> 01:04:53,973
Place your bets, ladies and gentlemen.

982
01:04:54,223 --> 01:04:56,725
 For Adam, the moment had come.  

983
01:04:57,059 --> 01:05:00,396
 He knew this time it would be different,  
 and it was.  

984
01:05:01,480 --> 01:05:02,523
Yes!

985
01:05:21,583 --> 01:05:22,751
The management has asked me...

986
01:05:22,793 --> 01:05:25,879
whether you might be willing to retire
for the evening?

987
01:05:27,589 --> 01:05:28,924
One more bet.

988
01:05:28,966 --> 01:05:33,095
My entire stake, $320,000, on black.

989
01:05:37,641 --> 01:05:39,143
 Very well, monsieur.  

990
01:05:39,226 --> 01:05:42,563
 One more win and Polina would be his.  

991
01:05:43,230 --> 01:05:46,317
 There are times in life 
 when for no apparent reason...  

992
01:05:46,442 --> 01:05:49,570
 an unexplained sense of well-being 
 comes over you.  

993
01:05:49,653 --> 01:05:51,363
 You're at one with the universe.  

994
01:05:51,488 --> 01:05:55,492
 You know exactly who you are,  
 and your place in the world is secure.  

995
01:05:55,492 --> 01:05:59,955
 For Adam, that sense of ultimate bliss 
 was destroyed by two words.  

996
01:06:02,333 --> 01:06:03,876
Thirty-six, red.

997
01:06:04,126 --> 01:06:06,629
 Just like that, it was all gone.  

998
01:06:07,546 --> 01:06:09,965
 His money, his future with Polina...  

999
01:06:09,965 --> 01:06:12,885
 and Adam was convinced, his life.  

1000
01:06:13,761 --> 01:06:16,722
Please don't tell me
he's going to go running back to Anna.

1001
01:06:16,972 --> 01:06:18,182
I don't know.

1002
01:06:19,600 --> 01:06:21,226
Again, you don't know.

1003
01:06:22,394 --> 01:06:23,562
I'll get it.

1004
01:06:23,812 --> 01:06:25,648
Who the hell could that be?

1005
01:06:27,441 --> 01:06:28,651
It's a lady.

1006
01:06:30,819 --> 01:06:34,740
- I hope we're not disturbing you, baby.
- As a matter of fact, you are.

1007
01:06:37,242 --> 01:06:38,994
It's a figure of speech.

1008
01:06:39,244 --> 01:06:42,122
How are you doing, boys?
I like those shirts.

1009
01:06:42,498 --> 01:06:45,250
- You've got a bat.
- We're here for a reminder.

1010
01:06:45,292 --> 01:06:47,628
Wait a second.
I got one more day. I'm almost done.

1011
01:06:47,711 --> 01:06:50,339
It's good. We help you to finish.

1012
01:06:50,381 --> 01:06:51,757
What are you doing?

1013
01:06:53,342 --> 01:06:54,426
Jesus!

1014
01:06:57,513 --> 01:07:00,849
- No distractions.
- That's my TV! What are you guys...

1015
01:07:02,351 --> 01:07:04,853
It's good. You finish the book.

1016
01:07:04,979 --> 01:07:07,523
You get the money. You buy a flat screen.

1017
01:07:07,564 --> 01:07:09,108
Better picture, man.

1018
01:07:09,149 --> 01:07:10,901
 Twenty-four hours, chico.  

1019
01:07:10,985 --> 01:07:12,444
not 25.

1020
01:07:16,824 --> 01:07:18,117
Bye, lady.

1021
01:07:21,245 --> 01:07:23,497
- Oh, my God.
- Are you okay?

1022
01:07:23,831 --> 01:07:25,249
Are you all right?

1023
01:07:25,416 --> 01:07:28,877
- Should we call the cops?
- I don't think that's a very good idea.

1024
01:07:28,877 --> 01:07:31,005
Let's finish the book.
They'll get their money.

1025
01:07:31,046 --> 01:07:32,923
Everything will be fine.

1026
01:07:33,048 --> 01:07:34,341
Wait a minute.

1027
01:07:35,050 --> 01:07:37,594
Those are the flamenco dancers,
aren't they?

1028
01:07:38,262 --> 01:07:41,640
You borrowed money to gamble?
Are you out of your mind?

1029
01:07:41,724 --> 01:07:44,810
- At the time, yes.
- So is everything in this book true?

1030
01:07:45,144 --> 01:07:48,522
no. There are things I take from real life...

1031
01:07:48,522 --> 01:07:51,233
- That work for the story.
- Who else is going to show up?

1032
01:07:51,358 --> 01:07:54,695
You've some sick grandmother
who's going to roll in here and drop dead?

1033
01:07:54,778 --> 01:07:56,572
Is there really a Polina?

1034
01:07:57,781 --> 01:08:00,367
The next time Dimwit and Lowboy
come back here...

1035
01:08:00,409 --> 01:08:03,704
they're not just
going to be smashing telephones and TVs.

1036
01:08:03,996 --> 01:08:07,249
So, please, let's just try and finish.

1037
01:08:08,208 --> 01:08:09,918
There are banks, you know.

1038
01:08:10,419 --> 01:08:11,920
Yes, I know.

1039
01:08:12,838 --> 01:08:15,382
If you want to take a break, I understand.

1040
01:08:16,050 --> 01:08:17,343
no, I'm fine.

1041
01:08:18,469 --> 01:08:20,596
You're the one they want to kill.

1042
01:08:20,846 --> 01:08:23,182
Way to bounce back. Here we go.

1043
01:08:24,683 --> 01:08:26,310
As Adam walked... no.

1044
01:08:26,310 --> 01:08:28,854
As Adam wandered
the streets of Saint Charles...

1045
01:08:28,896 --> 01:08:31,482
like a man
who had not only lost all his money...

1046
01:08:31,690 --> 01:08:33,651
but all sense of who he was...

1047
01:08:33,943 --> 01:08:38,072
he found himself lying under
the boardwalk, next to an old seagull.

1048
01:08:38,530 --> 01:08:42,743
He stared vacantly into the gull's eyes
and finally drifted off...

1049
01:08:51,001 --> 01:08:52,419
How are you doing?

1050
01:08:53,003 --> 01:08:55,172
Were you sleeping or just thinking?

1051
01:08:56,215 --> 01:08:57,800
I was sleep-thinking.

1052
01:08:58,217 --> 01:09:00,010
Maybe we should take a break.

1053
01:09:00,219 --> 01:09:02,471
no. We've got to keep going.

1054
01:09:02,805 --> 01:09:06,558
If we get a couple hours of sleep,
then we can make the final push.

1055
01:09:07,643 --> 01:09:09,144
Okay. Two hours.

1056
01:09:09,228 --> 01:09:13,232
I'll sleep on the couch. You take the bed.
Set the alarm while you're up there.

1057
01:09:13,482 --> 01:09:15,150
no, you should sleep in the bed.

1058
01:09:15,192 --> 01:09:16,610
I'll be fine on the couch.

1059
01:09:16,902 --> 01:09:19,530
Look at you.
You can't get any rest like that.

1060
01:09:19,571 --> 01:09:21,323
neither would you, so...

1061
01:09:21,323 --> 01:09:23,742
All right, we'll both sleep in the bed.

1062
01:09:24,910 --> 01:09:26,287
- You sure?
- Yeah.

1063
01:09:27,329 --> 01:09:28,414
Okay.

1064
01:09:33,544 --> 01:09:35,879
So you want to sleep together.

1065
01:09:36,588 --> 01:09:39,133
You're right.
You should sleep on the couch.

1066
01:09:39,216 --> 01:09:43,304
I'm saying it's a rarely used meaning
of the term "sleep together"...

1067
01:09:43,387 --> 01:09:47,516
where there's actual sleep involved
with snoring, REM cycles and all that.

1068
01:09:47,641 --> 01:09:49,685
That's all I meant.

1069
01:09:51,228 --> 01:09:52,855
I'm setting the alarm.

1070
01:10:05,284 --> 01:10:06,410
Good night.

1071
01:10:09,288 --> 01:10:12,833
Can you say good night
if you're only sleeping for two hours?

1072
01:10:14,752 --> 01:10:16,003
Good night.

1073
01:10:16,337 --> 01:10:18,005
Apparently you can.

1074
01:10:24,928 --> 01:10:26,221
Good night.

1075
01:10:31,602 --> 01:10:33,187
So, what's his name?

1076
01:10:33,979 --> 01:10:35,105
What?

1077
01:10:35,606 --> 01:10:36,982
What's his name?

1078
01:10:37,608 --> 01:10:38,734
Who?

1079
01:10:38,984 --> 01:10:40,277
Your fiance.

1080
01:10:43,614 --> 01:10:46,116
I thought we were trying
to get some sleep.

1081
01:10:46,825 --> 01:10:49,161
I just want to know what his name is.

1082
01:10:52,456 --> 01:10:53,666
It's Art.

1083
01:10:56,293 --> 01:10:58,629
Art Greco.

1084
01:11:02,508 --> 01:11:03,926
Art Greco?

1085
01:11:07,721 --> 01:11:10,265
Art Greco, the discount dentist?

1086
01:11:11,141 --> 01:11:12,142
What?

1087
01:11:12,518 --> 01:11:14,186
The guy on all the buses?

1088
01:11:17,982 --> 01:11:18,983
Yeah.

1089
01:11:23,195 --> 01:11:26,824
He must be good
because you've got excellent teeth.

1090
01:11:29,201 --> 01:11:30,703
Wait a minute.

1091
01:11:31,996 --> 01:11:34,248
Maybe I'm being presumptuous here.

1092
01:11:34,248 --> 01:11:36,375
Just because he's your fiance...

1093
01:11:37,209 --> 01:11:40,963
and a dentist doesn't automatically
make him your dentist.

1094
01:11:41,046 --> 01:11:43,340
Maybe it's a conflict of interest thing...

1095
01:11:43,465 --> 01:11:46,510
like a doctor
that won't operate on his own family.

1096
01:11:46,677 --> 01:11:49,888
On the other hand,
drilling a tooth isn't exactly surgery...

1097
01:11:49,888 --> 01:11:52,391
although they do call it oral surgery.
So, I suppose...

1098
01:11:52,516 --> 01:11:54,226
All right, I lied!

1099
01:11:55,311 --> 01:11:59,189
I don't have a boyfriend or a fiance.
I'm not getting married.

1100
01:12:02,151 --> 01:12:04,194
But Art Greco is your dentist.

1101
01:12:06,155 --> 01:12:07,573
I'm sorry...

1102
01:12:08,574 --> 01:12:12,077
but if you met you the way I met you,
what would you have done?

1103
01:12:13,621 --> 01:12:16,498
I probably would have turned around
and walked out.

1104
01:12:18,208 --> 01:12:20,085
I'm glad you didn't, though.

1105
01:12:24,423 --> 01:12:25,507
Me, too.

1106
01:12:26,842 --> 01:12:29,345
I'm also glad you don't have a boyfriend.

1107
01:12:35,476 --> 01:12:36,644
Me, too.

1108
01:12:59,375 --> 01:13:03,587
He awoke early the next morning
to find the seagull sitting on his chest.

1109
01:13:03,587 --> 01:13:08,300
As the morning mist on the beach
and the one in his mind started to clear...

1110
01:13:08,425 --> 01:13:10,886
his thoughts turned once more to Polina.

1111
01:13:16,642 --> 01:13:17,685
Yes?

1112
01:13:20,854 --> 01:13:22,273
Is there a Polina?

1113
01:13:23,649 --> 01:13:25,025
What do you mean?

1114
01:13:25,651 --> 01:13:26,860
In real life.

1115
01:13:29,488 --> 01:13:31,240
no. Not really.

1116
01:13:32,700 --> 01:13:34,159
She's an amalgam.

1117
01:13:35,703 --> 01:13:36,912
An amalgam?

1118
01:13:37,121 --> 01:13:40,291
Yeah. She's a combination
of a lot of women I've known.

1119
01:13:41,125 --> 01:13:43,627
You've been with a lot of women like her?

1120
01:13:44,336 --> 01:13:46,922
no. You know, you meet people like that.

1121
01:13:47,172 --> 01:13:48,966
They run in a fast crowd.

1122
01:13:49,800 --> 01:13:51,927
You've been in these fast crowds?

1123
01:13:52,761 --> 01:13:54,555
no. You know what I mean.

1124
01:13:55,806 --> 01:13:59,184
You read about them.
They're always running off to be with...

1125
01:13:59,602 --> 01:14:04,231
that guy on a boat
or this guy on a private plane.

1126
01:14:05,816 --> 01:14:07,276
She's an amalgam.

1127
01:14:10,237 --> 01:14:12,114
 Adam went to find Polina...  

1128
01:14:12,239 --> 01:14:15,326
 hoping against hope 
 there was still a chance for him.  

1129
01:14:15,451 --> 01:14:17,077
How much did you lose?

1130
01:14:17,494 --> 01:14:19,830
Everything. But I can win it back.

1131
01:14:22,124 --> 01:14:25,002
Would you be a dear
and hand me that pumice stone?

1132
01:14:28,922 --> 01:14:30,591
I know it's a cliche...

1133
01:14:32,343 --> 01:14:36,388
to say the best things in life are free
and that money can't buy love...

1134
01:14:36,430 --> 01:14:39,516
but that's how they become cliches,
because they're true.

1135
01:14:39,767 --> 01:14:41,518
Shouldn't love trump everything?

1136
01:14:41,560 --> 01:14:43,979
If only we lived in a world of shoulds.

1137
01:14:44,021 --> 01:14:45,272
We can.

1138
01:14:45,397 --> 01:14:47,524
no, we should. But we can't.

1139
01:14:49,401 --> 01:14:52,488
Please don't deny yourself real happiness.

1140
01:14:52,613 --> 01:14:54,073
I'll try not to.

1141
01:14:55,824 --> 01:14:58,202
Could you hand me that robe over there?

1142
01:15:09,880 --> 01:15:12,132
There were times I just adored you.

1143
01:15:13,467 --> 01:15:16,095
 With the vacation coming to a close...  

1144
01:15:16,345 --> 01:15:20,307
 and with the pieces of his heart scattered 
 by the summer winds of Saint Charles...  

1145
01:15:20,349 --> 01:15:24,311
 Adam sought solace in the one person 
 who had always been there for him.  

1146
01:15:24,770 --> 01:15:26,313
 She was a modern woman.  

1147
01:15:26,355 --> 01:15:28,816
 She would understand 
 if he spoke from his heart.  

1148
01:15:28,941 --> 01:15:31,318
 He was certain she would take him back.  

1149
01:15:32,361 --> 01:15:34,446
I don't suppose there's any chance
you might...

1150
01:15:34,571 --> 01:15:35,614
no.

1151
01:15:35,781 --> 01:15:37,616
- Because I went off...
- Yeah.

1152
01:15:37,616 --> 01:15:39,493
- So even if I was to come...
- No.

1153
01:15:39,618 --> 01:15:41,996
- Because I've shown myself to be...
- Exactly.

1154
01:15:41,996 --> 01:15:43,956
- Okay. So I'll just go...
- Yeah.

1155
01:15:48,669 --> 01:15:52,589
 For the first time in his life,  
 he truly understood the expression:  

1156
01:15:52,673 --> 01:15:55,801
 "Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned." 

1157
01:15:55,884 --> 01:15:59,305
 Not to mention,  
 "Never bite off more than you can chew." 

1158
01:16:00,306 --> 01:16:02,391
 "Paying through the nose, " 
 on the other hand...  

1159
01:16:02,433 --> 01:16:04,560
 continued to present problems.  

1160
01:16:07,313 --> 01:16:08,522
 The end.  

1161
01:16:12,109 --> 01:16:13,527
He ends up alone.

1162
01:16:14,111 --> 01:16:15,613
You think it's too sad?

1163
01:16:15,779 --> 01:16:17,615
It's the only way it can be.

1164
01:16:17,781 --> 01:16:21,785
He never had a chance with Polina,
and Anna who was a real possible...

1165
01:16:21,952 --> 01:16:24,872
as soon as he felt getting close to her,
he ran for the hills.

1166
01:16:24,997 --> 01:16:27,041
It's a classic case of fear of intimacy.

1167
01:16:28,626 --> 01:16:30,669
Your other book was about that,
too, wasn't it?

1168
01:16:30,711 --> 01:16:32,921
no, that was about fear of commitment.

1169
01:16:38,636 --> 01:16:40,137
Right. Okay.

1170
01:16:41,639 --> 01:16:44,350
It's a funny book and it's sad.

1171
01:16:45,851 --> 01:16:49,855
It makes me feel for everyone in it,
and you did it in 29-and-a-half days.

1172
01:16:49,897 --> 01:16:51,774
You should feel very good.

1173
01:16:51,899 --> 01:16:53,859
Yeah. So, where are you going?

1174
01:16:54,693 --> 01:16:56,445
I have three days of transcription.

1175
01:16:56,528 --> 01:16:59,365
We only have six hours
until the Cuban invasion.

1176
01:16:59,740 --> 01:17:01,700
Do you really think it's good?

1177
01:17:02,534 --> 01:17:04,203
I think it's very good.

1178
01:17:06,163 --> 01:17:07,539
Thank you, Emma.

1179
01:17:07,915 --> 01:17:09,249
You're welcome.

1180
01:17:19,218 --> 01:17:20,386
You know... l, uh...

1181
01:17:26,850 --> 01:17:28,602
I "uh" you, too.

1182
01:17:38,487 --> 01:17:39,488
Bye.

1183
01:17:46,495 --> 01:17:47,913
Taxi!

1184
01:17:56,755 --> 01:17:58,132
Keep the change.

1185
01:18:17,610 --> 01:18:18,694
Hello.

1186
01:18:25,075 --> 01:18:26,243
Polina?

1187
01:18:52,561 --> 01:18:54,521
- You look good.
- You, too.

1188
01:19:06,241 --> 01:19:07,576
So, how you been?

1189
01:19:10,037 --> 01:19:12,289
- I left John.
- Really?

1190
01:19:14,833 --> 01:19:18,045
What can I say? I shouldn't have gone
with him in the first place.

1191
01:19:18,087 --> 01:19:20,547
You were looking out for your children.

1192
01:19:20,673 --> 01:19:23,968
That's my problem.
I never think of my own happiness.

1193
01:19:24,927 --> 01:19:27,429
You should have knocked me out,
tied me up.

1194
01:19:27,721 --> 01:19:29,306
Taken me away with you.

1195
01:19:50,411 --> 01:19:51,495
Thank you.

1196
01:20:00,212 --> 01:20:03,424
Deep down,
I always knew you were the one.

1197
01:20:15,060 --> 01:20:16,729
Are you seeing anyone?

1198
01:20:34,163 --> 01:20:36,290
When I saw you on that dock...

1199
01:20:36,373 --> 01:20:38,876
you were like something out of a fairy tale.

1200
01:20:40,377 --> 01:20:42,254
Really, I became intoxicated...

1201
01:20:42,421 --> 01:20:45,257
like somebody had slipped something
into the air.

1202
01:20:45,633 --> 01:20:46,634
All done.

1203
01:20:48,260 --> 01:20:51,930
I didn't know you'd be finished so soon.
I was just on my way back.

1204
01:20:52,640 --> 01:20:54,266
It's okay, I found you.

1205
01:20:56,852 --> 01:20:58,854
Emma, this is Polina.

1206
01:20:59,480 --> 01:21:00,940
Polina, this is Emma.

1207
01:21:01,065 --> 01:21:03,484
She's my stenographer.

1208
01:21:03,692 --> 01:21:07,321
I just finished dictating my novel to her.
She did an amazing job.

1209
01:21:10,074 --> 01:21:14,036
I have to go. It was very nice to meet you.
I've heard so much about you.

1210
01:21:14,328 --> 01:21:15,829
I'll be right back.

1211
01:21:16,747 --> 01:21:20,626
- I didn't know she was coming...
- Don't, Alex! Please!

1212
01:21:20,751 --> 01:21:22,503
You know what happens
with these things.

1213
01:21:22,586 --> 01:21:25,923
Somebody always says something
to make the other person feel better...

1214
01:21:25,965 --> 01:21:28,968
but it never does,
so if you could just not say anything!

1215
01:21:29,176 --> 01:21:30,761
Your stenographer?

1216
01:21:31,178 --> 01:21:34,181
You introduced me as your stenographer?

1217
01:21:34,807 --> 01:21:38,560
I didn't know what to say.
I didn't want to hurt either one of you.

1218
01:21:38,644 --> 01:21:41,772
no, Alex.
Who you didn't want to hurt was you.

1219
01:21:45,442 --> 01:21:46,568
Wait a sec.

1220
01:21:46,652 --> 01:21:48,487
You know what I can't figure out?

1221
01:21:48,487 --> 01:21:50,322
What's it going to be, sweetheart?

1222
01:21:50,489 --> 01:21:53,409
- One second.
- I can't figure out what's worse.

1223
01:21:53,450 --> 01:21:55,411
Having to know every detail...

1224
01:21:55,494 --> 01:21:58,414
about your desperate love
for some other woman...

1225
01:21:58,497 --> 01:22:01,041
or having to know
that you obviously never came close...

1226
01:22:01,333 --> 01:22:03,544
to feeling the same way about me.

1227
01:22:08,132 --> 01:22:09,466
Goodbye, Alex.

1228
01:22:24,189 --> 01:22:26,317
She's not just your stenographer.

1229
01:22:27,026 --> 01:22:28,027
no.

1230
01:22:28,819 --> 01:22:30,446
Is she your girlfriend?

1231
01:22:30,613 --> 01:22:31,947
not anymore.

1232
01:22:33,240 --> 01:22:34,825
Come with me tonight.

1233
01:22:35,034 --> 01:22:37,745
There's a darling little charity ball
at the Ritz.

1234
01:22:37,828 --> 01:22:39,330
Landmines, I think.

1235
01:22:39,455 --> 01:22:41,832
- I don't think I can...
- It's perfect.

1236
01:22:41,874 --> 01:22:44,793
You finished your novel.
We can leave for Paris in the morning.

1237
01:22:44,877 --> 01:22:48,505
It's beautiful this time of year,
and the kids would love to see you.

1238
01:22:48,714 --> 01:22:50,090
I'll take you to Giverny.

1239
01:22:50,090 --> 01:22:53,385
Have you ever seen the water lilies?
They're magical.

1240
01:22:58,140 --> 01:23:00,351
Have you ever done your own laundry?

1241
01:23:00,935 --> 01:23:01,977
What?

1242
01:23:02,561 --> 01:23:03,771
nothing.

1243
01:23:06,148 --> 01:23:08,692
You should have a gun to your head
more often.

1244
01:23:08,776 --> 01:23:10,569
- You like it?
- You kidding me?

1245
01:23:10,569 --> 01:23:14,740
Usually an author falls on his ass
with his second effort. This is terrific.

1246
01:23:14,823 --> 01:23:15,824
Okay!

1247
01:23:16,408 --> 01:23:19,078
Here you go. Just like you requested.

1248
01:23:19,453 --> 01:23:21,872
$25,000 made out to you...

1249
01:23:22,247 --> 01:23:25,417
and $100,000 made out to...

1250
01:23:25,459 --> 01:23:29,546
now is it "Cuban Mafia"
or "The Cuban Mafia"?

1251
01:23:30,047 --> 01:23:31,507
I'm kidding, cash.

1252
01:23:34,468 --> 01:23:36,595
What do you think of the ending?

1253
01:23:37,262 --> 01:23:39,348
I like it. It's bittersweet.

1254
01:24:01,578 --> 01:24:05,165
 Hi, I can't come to the phone right now.  
 Please leave a message.  

1255
01:24:05,207 --> 01:24:07,876
 Emma, it's me.  
 If you're there, please pick up.  

1256
01:24:08,627 --> 01:24:11,213
 "m not just calling 
 to make you feel better.  

1257
01:24:11,422 --> 01:24:13,340
I really need to talk to you.

1258
01:24:16,885 --> 01:24:18,512
Please give me a call.

1259
01:24:37,531 --> 01:24:38,699
Can we talk?

1260
01:24:39,908 --> 01:24:42,494
Did the fact
that you called 17 times last night...

1261
01:24:42,745 --> 01:24:45,873
with no response from me
send any kind of signal to you?

1262
01:24:46,332 --> 01:24:47,458
I'm not an idiot.

1263
01:24:47,541 --> 01:24:51,003
I figured you wanted to talk to me
but your machine was broken.

1264
01:24:51,378 --> 01:24:52,963
Wait a second.

1265
01:24:55,215 --> 01:24:57,134
I think I'm in love with you.

1266
01:24:57,384 --> 01:24:59,345
I think I couldn't care less.

1267
01:24:59,637 --> 01:25:01,138
Emma, please just...

1268
01:25:08,062 --> 01:25:11,899
 He screwed up big-time 
 with his wife's cousin!  

1269
01:25:11,941 --> 01:25:13,651
 I did not start this whole thing.  

1270
01:25:13,692 --> 01:25:14,985
 He tells one version.  

1271
01:25:15,069 --> 01:25:18,113
 She was telling me all the time 
 that my wife was cheating on me.  

1272
01:25:18,155 --> 01:25:19,490
 She tells another.  

1273
01:25:19,698 --> 01:25:21,909
 That's not how it happened. No.  

1274
01:25:22,117 --> 01:25:24,036
Maybe my life is not so bad.

1275
01:25:29,166 --> 01:25:30,125
Hello?

1276
01:25:32,127 --> 01:25:34,546
 -lf you keep this up...  
 -I have your check.  

1277
01:25:34,755 --> 01:25:37,800
I could bring it over.
Because you worked many extra hours...

1278
01:25:37,841 --> 01:25:39,593
 -I added in...  
 -Send it to me.  

1279
01:25:40,386 --> 01:25:43,138
- I need to talk to you about the book.
- No.

1280
01:25:44,556 --> 01:25:47,059
The ending is not right.
My editors think it's fine.

1281
01:25:47,101 --> 01:25:49,270
You're the only one I can talk to about it.

1282
01:25:49,436 --> 01:25:51,480
I'm not going to do this, Alex.

1283
01:25:51,605 --> 01:25:53,941
I think Adam should end up with Anna.

1284
01:25:54,441 --> 01:25:55,818
I don't think so.

1285
01:25:58,654 --> 01:26:01,156
Some things are nothing more
than what they are.

1286
01:26:01,240 --> 01:26:03,075
They're not meant to last.

1287
01:26:03,075 --> 01:26:04,868
They take their place in your heart...

1288
01:26:04,868 --> 01:26:07,413
and make you a little smarter
the next time.

1289
01:26:07,663 --> 01:26:10,249
If you care for me
as much as you say you do...

1290
01:26:10,291 --> 01:26:13,919
please respect my feelings
and let's move on with our lives.

1291
01:26:16,714 --> 01:26:17,715
Okay?

1292
01:26:20,718 --> 01:26:21,760
Okay.

1293
01:26:25,556 --> 01:26:26,890
Good night, Emma.

1294
01:26:27,766 --> 01:26:29,101
Goodbye, Alex.

1295
01:27:11,352 --> 01:27:12,645
Can I help you?

1296
01:27:15,356 --> 01:27:18,359
I'm here for a deposition.
Is there a Mr. Taylor?

1297
01:27:18,734 --> 01:27:22,196
Yes. We've been expecting you.
If you could just take a seat.

1298
01:27:24,823 --> 01:27:26,533
Your stenographer is here.

1299
01:27:26,575 --> 01:27:28,118
Yes, I'll tell her.

1300
01:27:29,411 --> 01:27:31,664
Someone will be with you in a moment.

1301
01:27:39,254 --> 01:27:40,422
Good morning.

1302
01:27:40,464 --> 01:27:43,092
I'm Marty Van Buren. Won't you come in?

1303
01:27:45,052 --> 01:27:46,637
- Yes.
- Just follow me.

1304
01:27:47,513 --> 01:27:50,975
Jenny, could you get me that deposition
on the McKinley case.

1305
01:27:51,058 --> 01:27:52,559
- Right away.
- Great.

1306
01:27:53,519 --> 01:27:57,064
Why don't you go in here and set up?

1307
01:27:57,314 --> 01:28:00,442
- Zack Taylor will be with you in a minute.
- Thank you.

1308
01:28:24,258 --> 01:28:25,342
Jesus!

1309
01:28:25,467 --> 01:28:28,304
Welcome to Polk, Taylor, Fillmore,
Pierce & Van Buren.

1310
01:28:28,345 --> 01:28:29,513
I take you met Marty.

1311
01:28:29,638 --> 01:28:30,806
What is this?

1312
01:28:31,265 --> 01:28:34,018
He's actually my publisher.
These are his offices.

1313
01:28:34,059 --> 01:28:37,396
He charged me for the lettering,
but the role-playing was free.

1314
01:28:37,479 --> 01:28:39,857
- What do you want from me?
- I told you.

1315
01:28:40,316 --> 01:28:43,986
I want to change the ending because
some people go right to the last page.

1316
01:28:44,028 --> 01:28:47,281
- So, it's important...
- You should get someone else to do this.

1317
01:28:48,949 --> 01:28:51,327
Look, there's no one else I trust.

1318
01:28:51,368 --> 01:28:54,455
You're the only one
who'll know if it's real and honest.

1319
01:28:54,580 --> 01:28:57,082
It's only a couple of pages. Emma, please.

1320
01:29:05,799 --> 01:29:07,593
Adam returned to Andover...

1321
01:29:07,801 --> 01:29:11,305
filled with the dizzying emotions
of the summer on Saint Charles.

1322
01:29:11,430 --> 01:29:14,266
Emotions that he hoped
he could capture on paper.

1323
01:29:14,391 --> 01:29:18,395
When his thoughts turned to Polina,
it was as if she were some kind of dream.

1324
01:29:18,646 --> 01:29:22,149
- I can't do this.
- Please, Emma. Just keep typing.

1325
01:29:36,538 --> 01:29:40,668
He remembered her flawless skin,
her dark, intense eyes...

1326
01:29:41,335 --> 01:29:42,878
her captivating smile.

1327
01:29:43,921 --> 01:29:47,007
Then one day,
that dream walked back into his life.

1328
01:29:47,049 --> 01:29:49,134
Her beauty was still undeniable.

1329
01:29:49,593 --> 01:29:52,763
- Why are you doing this to me?
- Because I need you to understand.

1330
01:29:52,805 --> 01:29:55,391
Just let me finish.
Then you can walk out the door...

1331
01:29:55,391 --> 01:29:57,851
and I swear I'll never bother you again.

1332
01:30:05,025 --> 01:30:08,404
Her beauty was still undeniable,
but it wasn't the same.

1333
01:30:08,862 --> 01:30:12,241
As she spoke of her feelings for him,
all he could think of was Anna.

1334
01:30:12,241 --> 01:30:14,410
Sweet, caring, beautiful Anna...

1335
01:30:15,035 --> 01:30:17,913
and how his own failings
had driven her away.

1336
01:30:18,497 --> 01:30:20,457
Anna had become part of him.

1337
01:30:21,125 --> 01:30:23,252
He had fallen
so completely in love with her...

1338
01:30:23,294 --> 01:30:26,922
that it was hopeless to think
he could ever be with anyone else.

1339
01:30:27,131 --> 01:30:29,633
And so he said goodbye to Polina...

1340
01:30:29,717 --> 01:30:32,636
and set off to win back
the heart of his true love.

1341
01:30:33,345 --> 01:30:37,349
Yes, Polina had been a dream,
like a creation from one of his stories...

1342
01:30:37,349 --> 01:30:38,726
but Anna was real.

1343
01:30:39,977 --> 01:30:41,562
For the first time in his life...

1344
01:30:41,562 --> 01:30:44,898
that felt more powerful
than anything he could ever invent.

1345
01:30:51,447 --> 01:30:52,406
The end.

1346
01:30:56,243 --> 01:30:57,828
nice last sentence.

1347
01:31:05,461 --> 01:31:07,087
I'm just a writer.

1348
01:31:08,047 --> 01:31:10,591
I don't know what to do to show you
how much I love you.

1349
01:31:10,674 --> 01:31:12,092
I only have words.

1350
01:31:12,885 --> 01:31:14,303
That's all I have.

1351
01:31:17,681 --> 01:31:19,058
Maybe I was wrong.

1352
01:31:20,559 --> 01:31:21,727
About what?

1353
01:31:22,937 --> 01:31:24,980
Maybe you can catch the rabbit.
