3
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:18,722
It's raining.

4
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:27,567
...

5
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:29,171
- You see that girl,

6
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:33,160
desperate, wandering like
a lost soul in the rain?

7
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:34,850
This is me.

8
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:36,924
Even I, who know the story,

9
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:40,408
I still wonder how
I had to get there.

10
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:44,644
This is the story of a girl
who sought love,

11
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:47,684
but the evil sought,
very badly.

12
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:54,286
That's it. Me is Josephine
24 years old, 1.78 m

13
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:57,768
and 3 years,
I live with Brad Pitt.

14
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:01,124
OK, for real, I'm 29 years old 4/4,
I 1.59m

15
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:03,084
and Brad Pitt, this is my cat.

16
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:05,282
I have no man,
plan tonight,

17
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:07,687
unconditional fan
Woody Allen.

18
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:09,564
Hi, you.

19
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:18,162
I must be in the office at 9am.
If I speed up, it should be ok.

20
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:22,251
I'm usually a 38
but these are small sizes, right?

21
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:25,003
This is already the 42, madame.

22
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:27,965
For special sizes
I have to order.

23
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:31,162
In absolute terms,
I is not evil.

24
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:32,885
I would find the same perfect

25
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:36,163
except a slight problem
proportions, as my mother says.

26
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:42,164
The men whistle.

27
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:43,448
Band obsessed.

28
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:46,041
Rule 1:
never respond favorably

29
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:47,446
a compliment on the street.

30
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:49,961
Rule 2: Always brag.

31
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:52,686
I do not stop me cruising.

32
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:55,288
I'm in a rush. I'm coming.

33
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:58,761
It is Gilles,

34
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:02,123
my superior, but unable
to exercise authority.

35
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:05,688
This is the most predictable guy
the world:

36
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:09,282
2 hours late.
I try to beat my record.

37
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:11,721
There, he will pass me a ton
urgent cases.

38
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:12,967
Urgent.

39
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:16,444
And then
he will tell me a boring thing.

40
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:18,881
The new HR
came in a meeting.

41
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:21,922
I said that you were
by appointment.

42
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:24,168
Take care of your ass, Gilles.

43
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:26,290
Now my dress.

44
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:29,051
Very pretty dress.
- Here ...

45
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:32,369
I asked you anything, it's crazy.
Must let me go.

46
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,642
Our only common point,
this is Woody Allen.

47
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:38,322
There's only me who recognize
the disguised office party.

48
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:48,242
It is Chloe, my BFF.

49
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:51,046
"Best Friend Forever"
it was being together.

50
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:54,403
I've never seen
without makeup.

51
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:56,204
She does everything that I dare not.

52
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,880
Thanks to her, I
sexual life by proxy

53
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:00,650
absolutely hectic.

54
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:03,684
Ah yes! It has extensions
and thinks I do not know.

55
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:07,487
And Chloe in the office,
is the Lady Gaga gossip.

56
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:09,921
It all begins
conversations by:

57
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:12,088
You missed the info of the century.
What?

58
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:13,327
Gilles has been dumped.

59
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:14,922
Exciting.

60
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:29,887
They laugh.

61
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:37,451
- Oh, he's homeless.

62
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:39,005
This is so cute.

63
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:41,521
I consoled well
in my big bed.

64
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:44,162
There's a trick
do you like about this guy?

65
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:45,521
Yeah.

66
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:47,643
It's very unsettling.

67
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,360
Who is it?

68
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,924
Alexandra gadget, the new HR.
Canon and rather cool.

69
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:56,566
The new HR?

70
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:57,886
Are you kidding?

71
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:58,729
She is 19 years old.

72
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:00,524
No.
- If!

73
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:03,408
Josephine?
And you, Alexandra?

74
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:06,046
Yes. Alex, you can tu me.

75
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:09,369
Must find one day
lunch together,

76
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:10,721
to know.

77
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:12,649
Outright.
0K, great.

78
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:15,366
I would kill for
this little dress.

79
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,490
I hallucinate.

80
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:23,604
What arrogance!
You saw, she took me up.

81
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:27,288
Si This is crazy.

82
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:31,844
It is my torture session
monthly with my sister.

83
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:33,562
Diane.

84
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:35,970
Perfection.

85
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:38,283
Even current
she is wearing.

86
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:41,563
Small, she wanted to be
Princess and I baker.

87
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:44,648
I think that my parents

88
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:47,810
have a draft with me,
then they made my sister.

89
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,684
You're scarlet, stop.

90
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:52,963
No, it's okay.
I'm high on endorphins.

91
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:57,244
You have a gift for 30 years
parents' marriage?

92
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:59,249
You do not wanna deal with it?

93
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:03,482
No, I have their gift
and I can not share it.

94
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,091
It's really personal.

95
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:08,966
I love it, but we are unable
to say a nice thing.

96
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:11,049
What? Your diary?

97
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:13,846
I read. It is not
great literature.

98
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:14,882
What?

99
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:16,642
Whatever.

100
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:20,761
This is something that will make
Mom and Dad overjoyed.

101
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:22,127
The dream of their life.

102
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:24,971
You change your sex?
They always wanted a son.

103
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:26,366
Anything.

104
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:29,608
I'm getting married.

105
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:33,607
Jojo?

106
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:34,767
Ca va?

107
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:38,286
I'm on top.

108
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:40,320
Who is it?

109
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:43,171
Aymeric, it's been a year
that is common.

110
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:45,840
And we put a baby on the way
right after the wedding.

111
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:49,567
No time to lose.
I already feel old at 27.

112
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:51,649
When I think
Mom you had it to 19.

113
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:52,966
Ca va? You're weird.

114
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:54,282
Yes.

115
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:56,725
It's just that ...

116
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:59,324
I too am getting married.

117
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:01,127
How?

118
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:04,281
You do not have guy.

119
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:06,608
Why did you tell me?
With who?

120
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,848
Jojo? Jojo?

121
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:10,201
But with whom?

122
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:13,250
We rang the doorbell.

123
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:18,406
Shit! Saturday.
Shit, shit! Julien.

124
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:21,763
Lively music

125
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:26,327
Pile driver

126
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:29,205
Here's a second.

127
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:34,840
...

128
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,049
It is Julien.
My lover

129
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:51,446
part time.

130
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:54,127
This is weird.

131
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:57,722
There's like a smell Hedgehog
crashed on a road.

132
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,843
He became hemiplegic.

133
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:05,047
We are very much in love,
, but he can not leave

134
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:06,162
his depressed wife.

135
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:08,124
But hey, it's all temporary.

136
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:10,084
- And that's it.

137
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:11,641
You come from?

138
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:14,889
For 1 year, every Saturday
during 1/2 hour,

139
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:18,209
Julien comes walking his dog
at home.

140
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:24,400
Playful music

141
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:29,600
...

142
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:37,441
Moans of pleasure

143
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:39,051
Cries of pleasure

144
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:46,687
It's amazing he died
while we made love.

145
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:50,282
Almost as if we let
a kind of message.

146
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:51,242
Not too much, no.

147
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:53,329
For a year, every Saturday

148
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:57,127
your dog you used as a pretext
to see me.

149
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,002
It's crazy signs,
anyway.

150
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:03,121
Need you to think
all that.

151
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:06,049
Especially when you think about it,

152
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:09,210
love you more than your wife
you do not have children with her

153
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:11,004
and then you're alright with me.

154
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:14,441
You're free in a month

155
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:17,246
for wedding anniversary
my parents?

156
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:19,087
I do not know.

157
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:22,968
I told you? Nathalie
hospitalized for depression.

158
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:26,249
I must go.

159
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,490
This is the time of visits.

160
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:34,123
For now, the only gift
it has made me a dead dog.

161
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:36,482
In such cases,
I have 5 years of mental age

162
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:39,809
I sleep with my brain fat.

163
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,765
And it is they
I called to the rescue.

164
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:44,530
Cyril, my second best friend.

165
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:45,403
It smells jackal.

166
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:48,809
Chloe and Rose,
my girlfriend childhood.

167
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,527
It is seen in a bathtub.
Since we are sisters pee.

168
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:54,722
Jo, stop, okay.
Stop eating.

169
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:57,043
What is happening?

170
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:01,609
What is this thing?

171
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:02,722
Oh!

172
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:04,331
It's yucky!

173
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:06,602
There's nothing to hang.

174
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,844
1: You get rid of the dog.

175
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:12,042
2: You call your sister
to say

176
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:13,526
you will not marry.

177
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:15,051
Why'd you say that?

178
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:18,684
She narguée me
her perfect ass, her perfect guy,

179
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:20,041
I am nothing.

180
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:21,366
She humiliated me

181
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:23,005
I defended myself.

182
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:26,090
You were right, my poupette.
Drinking a guy we know?

183
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:27,088
Besides Cyril,

184
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:28,930
Jo could present.

185
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:31,126
- If I was not gay,

186
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:32,128
I ask
your hand.

187
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:35,130
It is 300 euros, cremation.

188
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:38,127
At this price,
I crazy fire myself.

189
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:40,928
Though not,
I must watch Julien

190
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:42,610
I manage
heavy stuff.

191
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:46,168
For 1 year, your relationship
with this type has not changed.

192
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:48,886
Always the same sex,
the same look.

193
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:49,922
Even a croissant.

194
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:51,963
Find yourself another guy.

195
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:55,007
Step 1, to register
on a dating site.

196
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:57,441
Here, sensual. Sensual!

197
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:58,448
Go!

198
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:01,005
- Profile sought.

199
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,406
Your ideal man?

200
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:06,525
Non-smoker, good cook,
fan of Woody Allen,

201
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:08,961
who loves cats
who wants lots of kids.

202
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:11,211
Then interests?

203
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:16,247
Literature.

204
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:17,407
Museums, galleries ...

205
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:18,931
Galeries Lafayette!

206
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:20,451
They laugh.

207
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:21,687
It is all about the picture.

208
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:24,567
Let's see.

209
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:26,091
You got it,

210
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:28,009
which is not bad.

211
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:29,361
A free my ass.

212
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:32,484
Stop with your ass
do something else.

213
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:35,160
Try surgery.
Me, it has changed my life.

214
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:38,284
Did you do that?
Did not you notice?

215
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:41,807
Oh, no.

216
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:50,966
Which do you prefer?

217
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:53,605
That one.

218
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:56,369
You got lucky
Marcelo see you

219
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:58,449
before returning to Brazil.

220
00:10:59,160 --> 00:10:59,888
Josephine Lapierre?

221
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:02,327
Go.

222
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:04,407
Hello, Chloe.

223
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:05,761
Good morning.

224
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,367
This is good.
You can get dressed.

225
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:30,402
Then?

226
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:33,970
We will be able to
Liposuction?

227
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:36,085
I'm supposed to think,

228
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:38,931
but it can be on.

229
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:39,962
No.

230
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:44,888
Liposuction is not suitable
your fat profile.

231
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:47,205
So what?

232
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:50,082
Cellu M6?

233
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:52,169
Laser and body-share?

234
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:54,882
What to do?
Do not touch anything.

235
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:58,368
You have a great ass.
Eventually the sport.

236
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:00,927
I will advocate the sport.

237
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:05,842
I will not say thank you.

238
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:10,250
They are at it, these diplomas?
It will.

239
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:13,883
It made me a thing
when he touched me.

240
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:16,845
Genre?
Genre chills.

241
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:18,121
I was embarrassed.

242
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:20,687
You wanna do, babe.

243
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:22,644
Wait, it will make you?

244
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:25,525
No, she's just been
her big bitch sloppy self.

245
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:27,768
Your style is your ass.

246
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:30,884
The fishing was good.
The race for the ideal son

247
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:32,491
looks pretty good.

248
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:35,604
Step 2, make my day.
Discreetly.

249
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:40,124
Gilles easy. It is difficult to
ease in cases of sexual tension.

250
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:41,207
- Josephine?

251
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:44,041
Recalculate budget

252
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:46,368
with suppression
2 elephants.

253
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:48,528
Huh? Elephants?

254
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:49,846
Yes, Gilles.

255
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:51,724
Elephants cost an arm.

256
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:53,160
Yes.

257
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:55,290
They change

258
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:57,323
5 giraffes with 10 cats.

259
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:00,770
That's the seller.

260
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:02,530
That's perfect.

261
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:04,290
- But they want the mods

262
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:06,130
before noon, okay?

263
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:07,846
As if it was done.

264
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:08,962
I'm too strong.

265
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:12,926
I can organize the casting
the perfect guy

266
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:14,804
while smoking out my superior.

267
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,287
If it speaks to me of my dress,
it is won.

268
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:19,528
- She is very beautiful,
your blouse.

269
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:22,166
My blouse?
This is a dress, Gilles.

270
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:24,808
She is very beautiful.

271
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,604
Thank you, Gilles.

272
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:28,326
Nothing.

273
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:32,802
I'll go.
That's it.

274
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:38,324
Lap top.

275
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:43,684
Playful music

276
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:53,847
...

277
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:57,010
During this time,
you speak, you speak not.

278
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:59,806
I'm talking not
I look instead.

279
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,331
I would take you there

280
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:05,366
and we do Chabou Chabou.
It means "movement".

281
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:06,721
You want to go?

282
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:08,126
Nope!

283
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:13,321
Hello, Vincent, this is Jo.
If Josephine.

284
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:15,761
We were together in 2005.

285
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:17,446
Do not you remember?

286
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:20,850
I still can not forget you.

287
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:24,287
Hello?

288
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:26,084
Vincent is not.

289
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:29,124
I made a mistake,
I try Thierry.

290
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:31,561
Ah, that's your dad.

291
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:34,761
Wait before I pass.

292
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:37,442
Your mom still lives with you?

293
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:42,921
Even when I
downhole,

294
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:45,168
I do not care
because worldwide,

295
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:47,840
Angelina and I only
sleep with Brad Pitt.

296
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:52,047
Casting messed up
and all my ex resettled.

297
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:56,131
I have no man, a big ass
and treat urgent cases.

298
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:57,810
You just eat?

299
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:01,365
I'll spin you a hand.

300
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:03,688
- Thanks, you're a real pal.

301
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:06,123
Springs

302
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:07,287
Do not you answer?

303
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:09,084
No, it's Diane.

304
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:11,362
This is the anniversary
parents tomorrow.

305
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:13,644
She wants the name
my prince charming

306
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:15,205
for the plan table.

307
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:16,731
What a bitch!

308
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:22,650
I load control
something for lunch?

309
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:25,765
And if you ask Cyril?

310
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:28,882
No, Diane knows.

311
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:30,562
And Julien?

312
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:32,364
It's dead,
he left me a message.

313
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:34,164
He is sick,
40 kind of fever.

314
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:35,885
That's it!
And I'm frigid!

315
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:39,524
Apart order sandwiches,

316
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:42,121
I'm pretty good
in the role of the ideal son.

317
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:45,081
I am free,

318
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:46,406
if it can help you.

319
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:48,523
No, this is not what we want.

320
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:52,486
I'll have a tuna mayonnaise,
a chocolate donut,

321
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:55,251
cappuccino
with extra cream

322
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:56,851
and a macaroon pralines.

323
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:59,202
Me, I have more hunger,
suddenly.

324
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:01,482
Are you sure?
- Yes, thank you.

325
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:06,089
It is really too sweet.

326
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:08,968
I must do hit

327
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:10,161
by a bus.

328
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:11,927
To have an excuse

329
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:12,962
to not go.

330
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:15,481
Oh yeah?
Me, I have a better idea.

331
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:18,049
Turn around. Super, nickel.

332
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:21,289
With that, he will not
withstand.

333
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:24,530
Good evening.

334
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:26,650
Go, go, go.

335
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:33,891
Chloe?
What?

336
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:37,323
Are you sure?
Yes, please. It's gonna be great.

337
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:44,364
Playful music

338
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:49,560
...

339
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:00,284
It sounds.

340
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:09,247
- Dad?

341
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:11,010
She is a lady for you.

342
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:15,006
- Good evening.

343
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:17,882
Mr. Vissac.

344
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:20,082
This is the 3rd.

348
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:50,608
Oh!

349
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:53,691
We will close.

350
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:56,121
Yes, but now you're open.

351
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:58,368
So a ticket, please.

352
00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:00,324
You do not have smaller?

353
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:01,521
Nope.

354
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:10,845
This is your last lap

355
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:12,485
and after curtain.

356
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:19,200
...

357
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:00,964
Ooh ooh!

358
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:16,087
Ooh ooh!

359
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:22,565
She screams.

360
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:25,969
Let me down!

361
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:35,769
OK.

362
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:42,565
Playful music

363
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:46,685

364
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:50,971
Josephine screams.

365
00:19:56,080 --> 00:20:00,881
...

366
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:07,204
Shit.

367
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:12,890
Oh, shit!

368
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:16,441
This is the Day

369
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:19,530
I had to get
the arm of the ideal son

370
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:21,449
to destroy
perfection planet

371
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:24,803

Catchy country music

373
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:30,887
Taking stock?

374
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:34,570
No dosh,
no guy and no panties.

375
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:38,766
And not allowed either,
otherwise I would have pulled a crate.

376
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:43,960
...

377
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:52,401

- Ah, Josephine!

380
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:07,129

00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:12,281

Sorry.

Your delay

00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:17,291
it was used.

385
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:19,005
But what is this place?

386
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:21,844
And man
who was to accompany you?

387
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:22,927
He could not come.

388
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:23,928
- I rather think

389
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:24,928
there is not.

390
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:27,441
You never

Damn, that had to be super hard.

468
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:21,762
Birthday
my parents? Brilliant.

00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:25,602
You're not obliged to pretend.
I'm here.

470
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:27,325
It eats together this afternoon?

471

The ring is pierced
your sister?

472
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:31,681
Its number is damn

473
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:33,484
It's going great.

474
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:34,806
You're in denial.

475
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,525
You want a cappuccino?

476
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:37,687
Yes.

477
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:40,522
'You!

478
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:44,251
I have two words to say.

479
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:46,608
Thank you.

480
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:49,681
You rotten my life.
You steal my moments

481
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:51,166
greatest.

482
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:53,362
To my communion,
you threw up on my dress.

483
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:55,164
In my tank, have you called the school

484
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:57,567
for a bomb threat.
In my license,

485
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:58,647
you spun me a joint.

486
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:00,922
Tray, you did not have enough revised.

487
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:02,326
Stop, you hate me.

488
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:04,124
You agree not the same.

489
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:08,211
You've invented this Brazilian
who will marry you for trashing

490
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:09,526
my engagement.

491
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,286
A Brazilian!

492
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:12,891
Marcelo?

493
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:14,445
You know him?

494
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:16,165
Chloe introduced me.

495
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:23,531
All right.
Go, break up in Brazil.

496
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:25,802
You know what?
Do not come back.

497
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,365
Not especially back.

498
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:32,681
What is
this story from Brazil?

499
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:35,451
When I told
that the man of my life

500
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:38,291
ask me
to follow Brazil

501
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:40,164
you should have seen their faces.
Kif!

502
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:43,409
The slut! I will have presented
and you tell me anything.

503
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:46,004
No, because in fact ...

504
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:47,884
I do not want you.
It's great.

505
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:50,686
Go ahead, follow him.
You have nothing to lose.

506
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:51,927
You kiffes not your job,

507
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:53,929
you have not had
guys drinking from ...

508
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:56,168
You've never met
guys drinking.

509
00:26:56,360 --> 00:26:58,124
Then, you're already 30 years.

510
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:00,607
Go ahead,
I am fully with you, Jo.

511
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:03,167
Darkens. Get out there.

512
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:06,250
I need
to see you now.

513
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:09,889
It's great. I'm happy.
You got a little ...

514
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:13,211
Come on, darling.
Go Brazil!

515
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:16,970
Excellent!

516
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:20,006
Gilles!

517
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:27,803
In fact, you met
the man of your life.

518
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:30,244
What luck!

519
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:34,442
It was found completely,
Marcelo and me.

520
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:36,608
It was obvious
from the first look.

521
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:37,881
"The" meeting!

522
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:40,726
We will be very happy.

523
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:44,369
And you, you're someone
in your life?

524
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,731
What a relief!
You can not know.

525
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:51,890
In fact, I cry.

526
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:53,402
It makes pie?

527
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:55,762
No.
I must tell you.

528
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:58,042
I have to make cuts
in personnel.

529
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:00,288
Fire people.
It's awful, huh?

530
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:05,202
I hate my job.

531
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:08,927
So when an employee share
itself, it is a relief.

532
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:11,885
I am infinitely you
grateful, Josephine.

533
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:15,925
Grateful for what?
Can fire you.

534
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:18,248
To live your fabulous
love story.

535
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:22,367
I propose dismissal
with nice severance.

536
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:25,086
I sit on
your notice period.

537
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:27,204
I'd love to be able

538
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:29,607
to do the same thing as you.

539
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:31,802
Leave everything to a new life.

540
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:36,051
I'll miss the box.

541
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:37,844
And I'll miss you
me too.

542
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:44,121
Lively music
(Outkast)

543
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:48,325
...

544
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:50,807
Then?
I'm fired.

545
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:54,727
Too lucky.
It's great.

546
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:59,920
...

547
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:16,170
We rang the doorbell.

548
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:24,320
- That's us.

549
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:26,329
Do not worry, it will go.

550
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:29,046
Come on, Jo.
You relax.

551
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:32,641
- Go like, puts it.

552
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:38,646
A MARCELO!

553
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:44,761
Brazil!

554
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:51,570
...

555
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:59,530
When I am at the bottom of the hole,
What has more chocolate

556
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:02,371
and even live with Brad Pitt
comforted me,

557
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:05,848
I call my therapist. It has a number
where you can call 24 24.

558
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:08,122
Yes, hello,

Ah, I wake you.

561
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:16,648
I think I lost
control of my life.

562
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,401
From the point of
Brazil tomorrow.

563
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:24,084
Ah, that's a good thing?

564
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:28,369
Leave the bank.

565
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:32,568
Yes, losing control.

566
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:35,688
This is clearly what I do.

567
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:38,966
I never wanted
go to Brazil.

568
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:42,809
0K, OK, it goes like this,

569
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,810
I call you when I get home.
That's it.

570
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:47,526
Goodbye, Doctor.

571
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:53,770
And it is at this time
I fully measure

572
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:55,689
the extent of my stupidity.

573
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:56,961

I lied to everyone,
I have more work

576
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:06,765
and 15 minutes, I'm going to join
my imaginary future husband.

577
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:08,166
I tell them the truth.

578
00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:10,488
I must go.
Well yeah. Go.

579
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:12,011

Enough.

614
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:30,566
No, but it's okay?

615
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:32,922
This is a panic attack.

616
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,445
What do you have?

617
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:39,165
I know.

618
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:41,249
I was counting on you
to guide me.

619
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:43,408
One attitude will help you,

620
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:45,807
your turn to darkness,

621
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:49,561
without prejudice,
with a total naivety.

622
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:54,803
Why did you lie?
Why not tell others?

623
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:58,966
What obscure enjoyment
unconscious and prevents you

624
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:01,367
recognize the truth?

625
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:02,800
The door slams.

626
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:04,920
Josephine?

627
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:11,368
If I go, everyone
will know that I lied.

628
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:14,689
I tell them that the plane
had a mechanical problem.

629
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:18,888
They will all take me
for the next flight.

630
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:21,485
I need to find something.

631
00:34:21,680 --> 00:34:23,011
I must be in Brazil.

632
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:26,283
I have no desire to go
Brazil. Shit!

633
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:28,844
I must find
a good idea.

634
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:32,044
Good idea that will all
shut them.

635
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,571
How does nobody knows
Where's my suitcase?

636
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:39,127
Give me a responsible
airport.

637
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:40,685

Cry of surprise

684
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:27,045

685
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:29,129
Key in the lock

689
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:39,807
Is not communicating a lot,
but it is nice life together.

690
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:40,842
What?

691
00:38:42,120 --> 00:38:43,246
What is it?

692
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:46,164
Well, good day.

693
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:50,681
I saw
you wanted to report me!

694
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:52,328
Judas!

695
00:38:56,720 --> 00:39:00,486
At first it was really cool
have lied to everyone.

696
00:39:00,680 --> 00:39:03,126
To be officially gone.

697
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:05,766
As if I was dead
and in heaven.

698
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:08,645
I existed more
and my problems either.

699
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:10,683
As a secret agent.

700
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:14,968
The lie is the job
and I'm quite a beginner.

701
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:18,530
I called
a true professional.

702
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:21,849
Best mythomane
I know, Mr. Bullshit

703
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:23,405
and his new mutt.

704
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:26,080
He is a master in this field

705
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:28,009
and then he owes me that.

706
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:31,245
A lie takes planning.
It is thorough.

707
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:34,364
You must know everything
Brazil.

708
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:38,804
Culture, geography,
gastronomy, history.

709
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,240
We must control everything.

710
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:43,842
Emphasize details.
The bigger, the better it works.

711
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:45,929
I could be
very good advice.

712
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:49,246
When do you need
back from Brazil?

713
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:53,001
October 2. I will
the youngest widow family.

714
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:55,601
I see us already.
It white, I black.

715
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:56,926
A symbol.

716
00:39:57,120 --> 00:39:58,849
This is good, this.
This is huge.

717
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:01,042
Go ahead, watch.
What?

718
00:40:01,240 --> 00:40:04,323
What you gonna say?
How you gonna play it?

719
00:40:04,520 --> 00:40:05,407
I am your sister,

720
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:08,729
the liar show me
dormant in you.

721
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:16,520
He is dead.

722
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:20,890
He is dead.

723
00:40:24,680 --> 00:40:26,682
An hour before,
I was in his arms.

724
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:29,443
He wanted a child of mine.

725
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:31,810
And he died.

726
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:34,566
Why?

727
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:36,967
Marcelo!

728
00:40:37,160 --> 00:40:41,449
Killed in the favelas
have tried to save the poor.

729
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:44,645
Why?

730
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:47,443
Why him? Marcelo.

731
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:50,011
Come back!

732
00:40:50,360 --> 00:40:52,567
Not leave me alone.

733
00:40:55,840 --> 00:40:56,568
Then?

734
00:40:56,760 --> 00:40:58,842
You got a lot of potential.

735
00:41:05,120 --> 00:41:06,963
- Oh, shit!

736
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:09,164
It's stupid when you think about it.

737
00:41:09,360 --> 00:41:12,125
There's a guy at home
and I can not be with him.

738
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:14,004
It's a shame.

739
00:41:14,360 --> 00:41:16,931
He could have me
pizza with mushrooms.

740
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:20,211
We have watched old movies
Woody Allen.

741
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:22,528
I wonder which one he prefers.

742
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:24,609
Finally, it is not my man,
Gilles is.

743
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:27,201
Gilles, the boring guy
like rain.

744
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:28,128
Shit!

745
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:33,847
Playful music

746
00:41:34,680 --> 00:41:42,451
...

747
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:43,971
Meow aggressive

748
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:55,004
...

749
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:56,690
It stinks.

750
00:41:57,080 --> 00:42:05,966
...

751
00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:08,364
Here!

752
00:42:09,080 --> 00:42:10,730
It has exquisite air.

753
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:14,686
So, nuts of St. Jacques,

754
00:42:15,320 --> 00:42:17,721
prawns with coconut milk

755
00:42:18,200 --> 00:42:19,964
and lime.

756
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:21,127
It smells good.

757
00:42:21,320 --> 00:42:23,846
This is one of my specialties.

758
00:42:24,040 --> 00:42:27,010
Me, I do not eat seafood,
if I am suffocating.

759
00:42:27,600 --> 00:42:28,761
She laughs.

760
00:42:31,880 --> 00:42:34,360
Muffled cry

761
00:42:35,320 --> 00:42:36,162
Gilles.

762
00:42:36,360 --> 00:42:37,441
You'd be very cute

763
00:42:37,640 --> 00:42:39,768
with a real haircut

764
00:42:39,960 --> 00:42:41,291
and clothes of your age?

765
00:42:41,480 --> 00:42:43,050
I already successful

766
00:42:43,240 --> 00:42:44,446
dressed up like that.

767
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:45,562
Plus, I would have trouble.

768
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:47,285
They laugh.

769
00:42:49,880 --> 00:42:52,281
Jo knows that you live here?

770
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:55,086
You pay rent?
Jo, she cares.

771
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:56,486
- I do not care no.

772
00:42:56,680 --> 00:42:59,001
Josephine
no income.

773
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:01,248
We need to talk about it, that.

774
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:03,602
It is part
with a nice bonus.

775
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:05,325
It is the sun

776
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:08,205
with an armored guy
I care not for it.

777
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:10,209
Toasts are Josephine.

778
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:13,006
No improvisation, concrete,

779
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:14,725
credible.

780
00:43:14,920 --> 00:43:16,365
- A JOSEPHINE!

781
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:18,050
A JOSEPHINE!

782
00:43:18,600 --> 00:43:20,489
All right.
Warning!

783
00:43:20,680 --> 00:43:22,125
A little bit.

784
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:24,601
Portable

785
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:27,280
This is Josephine.
I answer?

786
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:28,845
Wait ...

787
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:30,849
Hello, darling.

788
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:32,280
Where are you?

789
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:35,484
We are with you
Chloe and Rose.

790
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:38,490
They dine on the terrace,
it is mild. And you, says.

791
00:43:38,680 --> 00:43:40,489
Put the speaker.

792
00:43:40,680 --> 00:43:41,920
OK, OK.

793
00:43:43,560 --> 00:43:45,210
That's it, everyone hears you.

794
00:43:45,400 --> 00:43:48,244
Gratoas, ouçam isso.
It means "Hi girls".

795
00:43:48,440 --> 00:43:49,851
HELLO, POUPETTE.

796
00:43:50,840 --> 00:43:52,524
* - This is crazy,

797
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:55,451
here I am on land
contrast where nature

798
00:43:55,640 --> 00:43:56,880
reaches extreme

799
00:43:57,080 --> 00:43:59,242
excess.
Excess!

800
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:01,488
That may be the key to Brazil.

801
00:44:03,120 --> 00:44:05,248
* There's a wind here
That's incredible.

802
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:06,805
I'm on top of Corcovado,

803
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:08,126
near the Christ the Redeemer.

804
00:44:08,320 --> 00:44:10,607
It's crazy.
I see the bay of Rio!

805
00:44:12,120 --> 00:44:14,566
I will become
a true Carioca.

806
00:44:16,240 --> 00:44:17,241
And you,

807
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:18,726
currently that with you?

808
00:44:18,920 --> 00:44:19,921
We!

809
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:22,691
Oh, the bitch!

810
00:44:23,720 --> 00:44:25,165
I feel good here.

811
00:44:25,360 --> 00:44:26,646
You can not imagine.

812
00:44:26,840 --> 00:44:30,162
Chloe, I do not know how
was to spend the day

813
00:44:30,360 --> 00:44:33,330
to call this poor Alex
"Turkey".

814
00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:34,922
Hello?

815
00:44:35,640 --> 00:44:36,482
Hello?

816
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:38,689
I hear you.

817
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:40,723
I hear you.
It is there.

818
00:44:40,920 --> 00:44:42,206
* - Me, it goes great.

819
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:44,243
Marcelo is sweet, caring,

820
00:44:44,440 --> 00:44:46,647
romantic.
In addition, it has a great booth

821
00:44:46,840 --> 00:44:49,411
on one of the most beautiful pla ...

822
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:52,406
It cut.

823
00:44:52,600 --> 00:44:53,840
It hung up.

824
00:44:56,880 --> 00:44:58,723
Why turkey?

825
00:45:00,320 --> 00:45:03,449
It is just because
your laugh is nothing.

826
00:45:03,640 --> 00:45:06,291
I laugh a turkey
and it's nothing.

827
00:45:06,920 --> 00:45:09,491
I had noticed
but you look great.

828
00:45:09,680 --> 00:45:11,284
It'll go great.

829
00:45:13,160 --> 00:45:14,161
I serve you?

830
00:45:14,360 --> 00:45:15,691
With pleasure!

831
00:45:16,440 --> 00:45:18,010
I feel tired me

832
00:45:18,200 --> 00:45:19,087
Excuse me.

833
00:45:19,280 --> 00:45:21,089
I'll go.
- No!

834
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:23,362
I feel
a little smeared.

835
00:45:24,200 --> 00:45:26,089
I'll walk you.

836
00:45:26,280 --> 00:45:28,044
Okay. Goodbye.

837
00:45:31,120 --> 00:45:32,565
Do honor to my flat,

838
00:45:32,760 --> 00:45:34,285
I'll be back.
Yeah.

839
00:45:34,760 --> 00:45:37,206
- She is super sensitive
for HR.

840
00:45:37,400 --> 00:45:39,368
If I wanted to hit me Gilles
it's dead.

841
00:45:39,560 --> 00:45:42,211
I, for cons, I have a chance.
Laughter

842
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:44,482
It will, I feel
the storm arrives.

843
00:45:44,680 --> 00:45:47,729
I hate feeling
wet dog.

844
00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:50,491
Come on, let's go.
- Here we go.

845
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,651
Thunderclap

846
00:46:32,080 --> 00:46:33,684
Meow

847
00:46:34,360 --> 00:46:36,249
Go, go!

848
00:46:37,080 --> 00:46:39,526
Go on, I tell you.

849
00:46:39,720 --> 00:46:42,451
Meow! Meow!

850
00:46:49,320 --> 00:46:51,004
- Come here,
my boyfriend.

851
00:46:52,480 --> 00:46:54,926
Calm down, everything's fine.

852
00:47:02,640 --> 00:47:06,201
She snores.

853
00:47:08,760 --> 00:47:11,161
Klaxons

854
00:47:27,280 --> 00:47:30,045
Playful music

855
00:47:30,240 --> 00:47:35,240
...

856
00:47:47,040 --> 00:47:48,690
Sneezing

857
00:47:50,200 --> 00:47:53,329
Brad Pitt?
What are you doing here?

858
00:47:55,560 --> 00:48:00,560
...

859
00:48:13,560 --> 00:48:14,402
Brad Pitt,

860
00:48:14,600 --> 00:48:15,840
Taking breakfast.

861
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:21,926
Well, go ahead.

862
00:48:22,120 --> 00:48:23,360
Is it good?

863
00:48:24,440 --> 00:48:26,124
Wanna Spoon?

864
00:48:27,360 --> 00:48:33,845
...

865
00:48:40,440 --> 00:48:43,569
Playful music

866
00:48:43,760 --> 00:48:48,760
...

867
00:48:55,760 --> 00:48:57,000
You're late.

868
00:48:57,200 --> 00:48:59,567
I had not recognized you.

869
00:49:00,800 --> 00:49:02,882
Oh, Chico Buarque!

870
00:49:03,760 --> 00:49:06,240
Damn, be careful!

871
00:49:06,680 --> 00:49:07,841
It will not?

872
00:49:08,040 --> 00:49:09,451
She sneezes.

873
00:49:10,240 --> 00:49:12,083
I have not missed them long.

874
00:49:12,280 --> 00:49:15,090
You're supposed to live
a love story in Brazil.

875
00:49:15,280 --> 00:49:17,886
Except I'm not in Brazil
and I have no boyfriend.

876
00:49:18,080 --> 00:49:19,161
And me?

877
00:49:19,840 --> 00:49:22,730
Half an hour every Saturday
does not count.

878
00:49:23,960 --> 00:49:25,166
Good morning.
Good morning.

879
00:49:25,360 --> 00:49:26,247
Good morning.

880
00:49:28,560 --> 00:49:30,289
You prepare
a trip to Brazil?

881
00:49:30,480 --> 00:49:31,720
No, my back.

882
00:49:34,840 --> 00:49:37,411
- Girls, you are wise
with uncle.

883
00:49:38,600 --> 00:49:41,444
Their father is not fucking
to keep them,

884
00:49:41,640 --> 00:49:44,530
while it has a two week
to kiss.

885
00:49:45,080 --> 00:49:46,366
Hush, anyway.

886
00:49:46,560 --> 00:49:48,324
They know that their parent
is an asshole

887
00:49:48,520 --> 00:49:50,090
like all men
family.

888
00:49:50,280 --> 00:49:52,248
I'm here, right?
- Yes.

889
00:49:52,440 --> 00:49:55,125
All men
are not bastards.

890
00:49:55,320 --> 00:49:56,810
Oddly, for those,

891
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:58,445
it's hard to settle down.

892
00:49:58,640 --> 00:50:00,768
Will not forget the school at 8:30.

893
00:50:00,960 --> 00:50:04,851
Jane. 8:45 Mona.
I forget not his blanket.

894
00:50:05,040 --> 00:50:06,371
I've kept.

895
00:50:06,560 --> 00:50:07,527
Rest.

896
00:50:08,680 --> 00:50:10,921
Thank you.
Hi, sis.

897
00:50:11,120 --> 00:50:12,451
I love home.

898
00:50:12,640 --> 00:50:14,369
- It's beautiful.
This is my home.

899
00:50:14,560 --> 00:50:15,322
- Bye-bye.

900
00:50:20,160 --> 00:50:21,446
Oh no, girls!

901
00:50:21,920 --> 00:50:23,604
Come on, open me.

902
00:50:25,280 --> 00:50:26,691
On one condition.

903
00:50:27,160 --> 00:50:28,605
You dare to blackmail?

904
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:29,847
- Yeah.

905
00:50:30,040 --> 00:50:30,848
It is dance.

906
00:50:31,880 --> 00:50:32,881
Okay, I promise.

907
00:50:33,240 --> 00:50:34,287
I can go?
- Yes.

908
00:50:34,480 --> 00:50:36,767
Gilles cries.

909
00:50:36,960 --> 00:50:38,849
Nieces screaming.

910
00:50:39,040 --> 00:50:40,485
- Tonton!

911
00:50:45,120 --> 00:50:47,043
- Girls, come on.

912
00:50:53,120 --> 00:50:54,770
It's beautiful, huh?

913
00:50:55,240 --> 00:50:58,562
How did they
to build it?

914
00:50:58,760 --> 00:51:00,444
It is a long time.

915
00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:03,450
- This is Gustave Eiffel
who built it.

916
00:51:04,200 --> 00:51:06,328
You make our eyes
that turn?

917
00:51:06,520 --> 00:51:08,284
- Attention!

918
00:51:08,480 --> 00:51:09,242
A,

919
00:51:09,440 --> 00:51:10,851
two, three.

920
00:51:12,840 --> 00:51:14,365
They laugh.

921
00:51:16,960 --> 00:51:18,724
Come on, we go to bed.

922
00:51:19,760 --> 00:51:21,250
Here we go.

923
00:51:22,040 --> 00:51:23,849

Music!
Listen.

927
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:32,240

00:51:37,360 --> 00:51:38,566

933
00:51:43,040 --> 00:51:43,768

...

939
00:52:09,560 --> 00:52:10,368
Go!

940
00:52:11,880 --> 00:52:12,802
- Like this?

941
00:52:15,960 --> 00:52:16,847
It turns.

942
00:52:17,040 --> 00:52:25,050
...

943
00:52:25,240 --> 00:52:26,526
Descends.

944
00:52:26,720 --> 00:52:34,161
...

945
00:52:34,360 --> 00:52:35,521
- Come on, Jane.

946
00:52:38,480 --> 00:52:39,527
It follows Gigi.

947
00:52:44,120 --> 00:52:45,531
Direction bathroom,

948
00:52:45,720 --> 00:52:47,563
brushing teeth.

949
00:52:48,240 --> 00:52:49,526
- Not on your life!

950
00:52:49,720 --> 00:52:54,720
...

951
00:53:04,600 --> 00:53:07,251
Goodbye.
Thank you, goodbye.

952
00:53:07,440 --> 00:53:08,726
You do not defer your jeans?

953
00:53:08,920 --> 00:53:11,321
Oh no,
she is too beautiful.

954
00:53:11,520 --> 00:53:13,443
Where do we go?
It is up to you.

955
00:53:13,640 --> 00:53:15,688
I am your knight.

956
00:53:16,240 --> 00:53:18,242
I want to see my sister.

957
00:53:19,040 --> 00:53:21,611
I want to spy,
it's wrong?

958
00:53:43,040 --> 00:53:44,963
She is beautiful,
she looks in love.

959
00:53:45,160 --> 00:53:48,289
I'll have to tell him
I'm happy for her.

960
00:53:57,680 --> 00:54:00,286
Why he bought flowers?
I know.

961
00:54:01,400 --> 00:54:03,767
For his mother, for his office.

962
00:54:04,200 --> 00:54:05,531
We're going to dinner?

963
00:54:05,720 --> 00:54:07,927
No, we follow first.

964
00:54:12,280 --> 00:54:14,009
Quickly! It is there.

965
00:54:14,200 --> 00:54:16,043
Engine roar

966
00:54:16,240 --> 00:54:21,240
...

967
00:54:44,200 --> 00:54:44,962
Madame.

968
00:54:45,160 --> 00:54:46,321
Josephine?

969
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:50,843
Sir.
- Thank you.

970
00:54:55,680 --> 00:54:57,011
Another vodka.

971
00:55:00,040 --> 00:55:00,882
Immediately.

972
00:55:03,200 --> 00:55:07,444
I image this big asshole
with his big whore.

973
00:55:07,640 --> 00:55:09,529
Eat, you'll be stuffed.

974
00:55:11,960 --> 00:55:14,850
Kind, it is shocking
what I just said.

975
00:55:15,040 --> 00:55:17,930
Y here has big assholes
with their whores.

976
00:55:20,040 --> 00:55:20,962
I do not understand.

977
00:55:21,480 --> 00:55:24,927
If he wants to draw poufs,
why marry my sister?

978
00:55:25,760 --> 00:55:27,808
I know.
I not know.

979
00:55:29,320 --> 00:55:30,560
You're sublime.

980
00:55:31,720 --> 00:55:33,370
You must have some idea.

981
00:55:33,560 --> 00:55:35,483
You sleep with me
while you're married.

982
00:55:38,320 --> 00:55:40,402
You fuck your wife yet?

983
00:55:42,760 --> 00:55:43,841
It happens to me.

984
00:55:46,240 --> 00:55:47,844
You have other mistresses?

985
00:55:48,040 --> 00:55:50,008
No. We talk about something else?

986
00:55:51,760 --> 00:55:53,444
I'll tell my sister.

987
00:55:53,640 --> 00:55:55,005
It will be unfortunate.

988
00:55:55,200 --> 00:55:57,248
It makes her happy,
asshole?

989
00:55:58,720 --> 00:56:00,370
You realize the happy wife?

990
00:56:00,920 --> 00:56:02,331
It is not possible!

991
00:56:05,280 --> 00:56:06,850
I want to see you again.

992
00:56:15,040 --> 00:56:17,441
Forgiveness. Excuse me.

993
00:56:17,640 --> 00:56:19,961
Clatter of dishes
Sorry.

994
00:56:20,160 --> 00:56:22,208
Have market

995
00:56:22,400 --> 00:56:25,529
with 12 cm heels
quietly?

996
00:56:26,520 --> 00:56:30,161
With 12 grams of alcohol in
blood, it is a breeze.

997
00:56:30,760 --> 00:56:31,886
Shh!

1002
00:58:29,560 --> 00:58:32,450
Who are you?
You're a friend of Uncle?

1003
00:58:33,680 --> 00:58:35,808
No.
I am person.

1004
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:36,808
I is not.

1005
00:58:37,360 --> 00:58:38,771
Go away.

1006
00:58:38,960 --> 00:58:40,724
If you exist. I see you.

1007
00:58:41,960 --> 00:58:43,610
I'll get Uncle.

1008
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:46,331
If you do that,

1009
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:48,684
I'll turn into a pig.

1010
00:58:49,880 --> 00:58:51,006
You're a witch?

1011
00:58:52,480 --> 00:58:53,845
I believe more.

1012
00:58:56,200 --> 00:58:59,044

1013
00:59:03,480 --> 00:59:07,371
Uncle, there is a witch.
She has big eyes owl.

1014
00:59:07,560 --> 00:59:08,766
- It does not exist.

1015
00:59:08,960 --> 00:59:11,088
- But if I saw.

1016
00:59:11,280 --> 00:59:14,443
She's a witch,
it has all the yellow hair.

1017
00:59:14,640 --> 00:59:16,324
I'm bad.

1018

1020
00:59:41,720 --> 00:59:44,326
When Gilles is not there,

1021
00:59:44,520 --> 00:59:46,124
I turn around.

1022
00:59:46,760 --> 00:59:49,206
It has never done this to me
with Julien.

1023
00:59:50,560 --> 00:59:54,281
I can not remove me
Gilles head.

1024
00:59:56,680 --> 00:59:57,602
What do you think?

1025
00:59:57,800 --> 00:59:59,882
Julien, you know.

1026
01:00:00,080 --> 01:00:01,525
But Gilles,

1027
01:00:01,720 --> 01:00:04,485
must sleep with him
before deciding.

1028
01:00:04,680 --> 01:00:06,603
This is not negligible,
sex.

1029
01:00:08,200 --> 01:00:10,601
As bizarre as
it may seem,

1030
01:00:10,800 --> 01:00:11,847
everything was clear.

1031
01:00:12,040 --> 01:00:14,122
Gilles was the man of my life.

1032
01:00:14,320 --> 01:00:15,651
It's pretty?

1033
01:00:15,840 --> 01:00:17,251
I just tell him.

1034
01:00:17,440 --> 01:00:19,363
I get home, it will be there.

1035
01:00:19,560 --> 01:00:22,803
I make it a beautiful statement,
it cracks and apologize

1036
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:23,887
for my shit

1037
01:00:24,080 --> 01:00:27,129
Be explained
I was not in Brazil.

1038
01:00:27,320 --> 01:00:30,847
As will love,
everyone will find it cute.

1039
01:00:31,040 --> 01:00:33,520
On paper, it was clear.

1040
01:00:41,240 --> 01:00:42,730
It will, Gilles?

Very happy, that's great.
This man is an angel.

It is soft, romantic,
attentive ...

1065
01:04:09,320 --> 01:04:14,121
He wants kids, kitchen well
and is a fan of Woody Allen.

1066
01:04:14,600 --> 01:04:16,090
This is a guy for me.

1067
01:04:19,080 --> 01:04:21,242
I think I've found
the ideal man.

1068
01:04:21,440 --> 01:04:23,886
I thought not
so in love with him.

1069
01:04:24,480 --> 01:04:25,606
I embrace you.

1070
01:04:28,800 --> 01:04:30,564

I have a problem.

I see ... Josephine ...

1080
01:05:07,680 --> 01:05:08,841
I take.

Man, what is it?

1082
01:05:17,840 --> 01:05:18,682

I'm happy
you're here.

This is Marcelo.

1086
01:06:06,080 --> 01:06:07,081
He is dead.

1087
01:06:09,600 --> 01:06:11,967
That's all I have left of him.

1088
01:06:13,960 --> 01:06:16,008
I feel so alone.

1089
01:06:21,200 --> 01:06:23,328
This is because it is resin.

1090
01:06:25,280 --> 01:06:27,089
So there, it's huge.

1091
01:06:27,280 --> 01:06:28,725
You're evil.

1092
01:06:28,920 --> 01:06:30,968
I can explain everything.

1093
01:06:31,160 --> 01:06:32,491
It's not interested.

1094
01:06:33,040 --> 01:06:34,883
You have not thought too far?

1095
01:06:36,480 --> 01:06:37,766
We go?

1096
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:51,490
I did not want what happens.

1097
01:06:51,680 --> 01:06:52,920
How?

1098
01:06:54,400 --> 01:06:55,447
It is you
which have caused it.

1099
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:58,321
You were happy
squatter home.

1100

I take my business.

1101
01:07:09,040 --> 01:07:12,283
I'm sorry,
I did not mean it. It's stupid.

1102
01:07:14,840 --> 01:07:15,966
Want.

01:08:13,800 --> 01:08:16,451
Your sister does not want
you to come to the wedding.

1111
01:08:16,640 --> 01:08:18,961
She prefers to change control.
Yes, Mom.

1112
01:08:19,160 --> 01:08:20,650
* - You give us concern.

1113
01:08:20,840 --> 01:08:25,129
I thought it would be nice
you go see someone.

1114
01:08:25,480 --> 01:08:27,050
I know someone very well.

1115
01:08:27,240 --> 01:08:29,208
I must go.
I'm busy.

1116
01:08:29,400 --> 01:08:31,528
* - Listen to me ...
That's it.

1117
01:08:32,600 --> 01:08:33,965
Meows

1118
01:08:34,160 --> 01:08:39,160

1119
01:09:10,600 --> 01:09:11,522
Hello.

1120
01:09:12,160 --> 01:09:13,571
Hello.

1121
01:09:13,760 --> 01:09:14,647
Ca va?

1122
01:09:14,840 --> 01:09:16,080
It will.

1123
01:09:18,800 --> 01:09:21,246
Excuse me for coming
when it was home.

1124
01:09:21,440 --> 01:09:23,522
Keep it.
I lived at home.

1125
01:09:23,720 --> 01:09:25,484
The rest does not interest me.

1126
01:09:28,120 --> 01:09:30,771
Take it
as compensation at least.

1127
01:09:31,560 --> 01:09:33,927
For cutting
hot water shower,

1128
01:09:34,120 --> 01:09:35,884
screwed up your rack

1129
01:09:36,640 --> 01:09:38,642
terrorizing your nieces.

1130
01:09:39,160 --> 01:09:40,127
That's it?

1131
01:09:40,320 --> 01:09:41,446
No.

1132
01:09:41,840 --> 01:09:45,287
I regret nothing
because I got to know you

1133
01:09:45,480 --> 01:09:47,323
and I liked
what I discovered.

1134
01:09:47,520 --> 01:09:48,885
Much.

1135
01:09:50,600 --> 01:09:52,762
You cook really well,
this is rare.

1136
01:09:52,960 --> 01:09:53,961
And you're nice.

1137
01:09:55,120 --> 01:09:57,441
3 years we worked together.
3 years.

1138
01:09:57,640 --> 01:09:59,404
You had all the time to see it.

1139
01:10:00,640 --> 01:10:03,484
I covered your delays,
was bringing you your cappuccinos.

1140
01:10:03,680 --> 01:10:06,081
No, I could not.

1141
01:10:06,280 --> 01:10:08,521
It's pathetic,
but it is like that.

1142
01:10:09,320 --> 01:10:10,606
And I'm sorry.

1143
01:10:13,120 --> 01:10:14,451
Give me a chance.

1144
01:10:18,600 --> 01:10:20,284
You're super sexy

1145
01:10:20,480 --> 01:10:22,801
Hey, you're home
Brazil?

1146
01:10:23,920 --> 01:10:26,287
We go?
The meeting in quarter of an hour.

1147
01:10:27,800 --> 01:10:29,609
Yes, hello.

1148
01:10:29,800 --> 01:10:30,528
Hello.

1149
01:10:30,720 --> 01:10:32,290
That is salvation.

1153
01:11:09,240 --> 01:11:10,048
Hello.

1154
01:11:10,520 --> 01:11:11,806
Hello.

1155
01:11:12,440 --> 01:11:13,726
I made my choice.

1156
01:11:23,280 --> 01:11:25,965
Me, I think it's your wife
who did the sorting.

1157
01:11:26,160 --> 01:11:26,922
I do not care.

1158
01:11:27,640 --> 01:11:28,641
Yes.

1159
01:11:28,840 --> 01:11:30,365
You're right.

1160
01:11:33,440 --> 01:11:35,841
I'll hosts time
that you're organized.

1161
01:11:39,840 --> 01:11:41,251
It suits us.

1162
01:11:41,440 --> 01:11:44,330
Melancholy music

...

1164
01:11:51,440 --> 01:11:53,283
If someone opposes
this union,

1165
01:11:53,480 --> 01:11:55,289
he says now
or forever hold your peace.

1166
01:11:55,480 --> 01:11:56,891
The door opens.

1167
01:12:02,400 --> 01:12:05,643
So I decided to spoil
still life of my sister.

1168
01:12:05,840 --> 01:12:08,127
But this time,
it was for a good cause.

1169
01:12:08,680 --> 01:12:09,602
I'm sorry.

1170
01:12:12,920 --> 01:12:14,251
Diane, I gotta talk to you.

1171
01:12:14,440 --> 01:12:16,488
No, Josephine, not that.

1172
01:12:16,680 --> 01:12:18,125
This is really important.

1173
01:12:18,600 --> 01:12:21,171
Get the hell out of here,
big ass!

1174
01:12:21,360 --> 01:12:22,168
I forbid you

1175
01:12:22,360 --> 01:12:23,486
talk to him like that.

1176
01:12:23,680 --> 01:12:25,523
What have you invented yet?

1177
01:12:27,440 --> 01:12:28,123
You come from?

1178
01:12:28,320 --> 01:12:33,320
...

1179
01:12:52,120 --> 01:12:53,770
You're right.

1180
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:00,331
I can not keep silent.

1181
01:13:00,520 --> 01:13:02,090
Cries of indignation

1182
01:13:02,680 --> 01:13:03,761
I tell you

1183
01:13:03,960 --> 01:13:04,768
in front of everyone.

1184
01:13:04,960 --> 01:13:07,122
Aymeric is not
in real estate.

1185
01:13:07,320 --> 01:13:10,244
It also tape whores
and under your nose.

1186
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:12,525
You deserve it not.

1187
01:13:12,720 --> 01:13:14,802
This is ridiculous.

1188
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:16,126
This is not possible.

1189
01:13:16,320 --> 01:13:19,563
Forget this guy,
it will make your misfortune

1190
01:13:19,760 --> 01:13:20,966
or you pass an STD.

1191
01:13:21,160 --> 01:13:22,810
Cries of indignation

1192
01:13:24,480 --> 01:13:25,129
Diane.

1193
01:13:31,960 --> 01:13:33,644
It's a shame!

1194
01:13:33,840 --> 01:13:35,046
- Please!

1195
01:13:35,240 --> 01:13:36,401
You are ridiculous.

1196
01:13:36,600 --> 01:13:37,840
Shh!

1197
01:13:38,960 --> 01:13:40,041
Property.

1198
01:13:40,760 --> 01:13:42,364
We will continue.

1199
01:13:48,120 --> 01:13:50,566
Cries of indignation

1200
01:13:50,760 --> 01:13:53,206

it breaks.

1203
01:14:30,520 --> 01:14:32,488
Do not cry, you've made the right choice.

1204
01:14:32,680 --> 01:14:34,011
I know.

1205
01:14:34,440 --> 01:14:36,408
Everything was so perfect.

1206
01:14:37,880 --> 01:14:39,769
I support not
for I was mistaken.

1207
01:14:40,400 --> 01:14:41,322
Do you understand?

1208
01:14:41,520 --> 01:14:45,286
No. There's not a moment of my life
I am not mistaken.

1209
01:14:45,480 --> 01:14:47,767
What do I do?

1210
01:14:48,600 --> 01:14:49,886
Up your pants.

1211
01:14:50,960 --> 01:14:53,361
You can be serious 5 minutes?

1212
01:14:53,560 --> 01:14:56,211
Rarely.
You should try it.

1213
01:14:59,360 --> 01:15:02,603
Dry your tears.
Teach me to be less perfect.

1214
01:15:02,800 --> 01:15:06,043
You've messed up your marriage
you got stung a limousine.

1215
01:15:06,240 --> 01:15:07,287
This is the right way.

1216
01:15:07,480 --> 01:15:08,925
You're crazy.

1217
01:15:09,120 --> 01:15:11,407
Thank you, my Jojo. I love you.

1218
01:15:11,920 --> 01:15:14,287
Me too, I love you,
my little sister.

1219
01:15:19,800 --> 01:15:22,531
Playful music

1221
01:15:39,560 --> 01:15:40,607
That is what?

1222
01:15:41,480 --> 01:15:43,687
I had wrong room.

1223
01:15:43,880 --> 01:15:45,644
You're a friend of Josephine?

1224
01:15:45,840 --> 01:15:47,410
I know not everyone.

1225
01:15:47,600 --> 01:15:48,931
Thou art?

1226
01:15:49,120 --> 01:15:50,360
Just an acquaintance.

1227
01:15:50,560 --> 01:15:51,686
Julien.

1228
01:15:52,400 --> 01:15:54,641
Gilles.
Delighted.

1229
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:56,206
You want to wait?

1230
01:15:56,400 --> 01:15:58,084
No, thank you, I ...

1231
01:15:59,160 --> 01:16:00,889
I prefer to go.

1232
01:16:02,360 --> 01:16:03,361
Forgiveness.

1233
01:16:26,160 --> 01:16:27,446
- It's okay?

1234
01:16:28,160 --> 01:16:29,810
Watch out for the limo.

1235
01:16:30,760 --> 01:16:32,205
I blunder.

1236
01:16:36,840 --> 01:16:37,807
Jo?

1237
01:16:41,080 --> 01:16:42,491
- Thank you, my sister.

1238
01:16:54,920 --> 01:16:56,206
Julien?

1239
01:16:58,440 --> 01:17:01,603
I let you 200 messages,
you have not called me back.

1240
01:17:01,800 --> 01:17:03,643
You make a scene?
Yeah.

1241
01:17:04,240 --> 01:17:05,969
Put your knife.

1242
01:17:06,160 --> 01:17:08,891
That is the roast,
not for you.

1243
01:17:25,960 --> 01:17:30,409
You do everything to seduce me
but I'm more in love with you.

1244
01:17:35,280 --> 01:17:37,760
This is because of the type
that just passed?

1245
01:17:38,800 --> 01:17:40,086
What kind?

1246
01:17:40,440 --> 01:17:42,044
The guy who lived there.

1247
01:17:43,120 --> 01:17:43,962
He was looking for you.

1248
01:17:47,800 --> 01:17:49,404
Have you slept with him?

1249
01:17:50,760 --> 01:17:52,569
Have you slept with him?
No.

1250
01:17:54,160 --> 01:17:54,968
No.

1251
01:18:14,680 --> 01:18:15,727
Gilles!

1252
01:18:18,280 --> 01:18:19,406
Gilles!

1253
01:18:21,640 --> 01:18:22,880
Gilles!

1254
01:18:24,480 --> 01:18:25,208
Gilles!

1255
01:18:35,680 --> 01:18:37,444
Wait, I need to talk to you.

1256
01:18:39,480 --> 01:18:40,811
Listen to me
or I do not care to the fleet.

1257
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:42,240
That's it.

1258
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:03,240
Josephine?

1259
01:19:04,120 --> 01:19:05,531
Josephine?

1260
01:19:08,880 --> 01:19:10,006
Shit, shit!

1261
01:19:11,920 --> 01:19:13,206
Stop it!

1262
01:19:14,480 --> 01:19:16,528
Must stop,
with your bullshit.

1263
01:19:16,720 --> 01:19:18,484
Only if you listen to me.

1264
01:19:20,200 --> 01:19:21,361
Okay.

1265
01:19:27,840 --> 01:19:28,727
I love you.

1266
01:19:29,400 --> 01:19:32,006
And the guy you live with,
it is okay?

1267
01:19:32,200 --> 01:19:34,965
This is Julien
my lover Saturday.

1268
01:19:35,600 --> 01:19:36,522
Finally, it was.

1269
01:19:36,720 --> 01:19:38,370
Now it's nothing.

1270
01:19:39,160 --> 01:19:42,050
I sleep in the guest room.
Yours.

1271
01:19:43,680 --> 01:19:44,488
Enough.

1272
01:19:44,680 --> 01:19:46,648
Trust me.

1273
01:19:46,840 --> 01:19:50,287
With you, I feel
that nothing can happen to me.

1274
01:19:52,480 --> 01:19:54,847
I would like to live with you
for real.

1275
01:19:55,040 --> 01:19:57,850
Rumblings of thunder

1276
01:20:01,880 --> 01:20:04,565
That, I think
that did the trick.

1277
01:20:04,760 --> 01:20:08,048
Now you know how
I got there.

1278
01:20:08,240 --> 01:20:10,891
I invented a life
at the other end of the world,

1279
01:20:11,080 --> 01:20:14,721
then it is sufficient to look
at the other end of my desk.

1280
01:20:15,480 --> 01:20:17,801
It's a little
the problem of my life.

1281
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:20,480
I never could look
the right place.

1282
01:20:21,040 --> 01:20:24,886
Classic melancholic music

...

1285
01:20:57,600 --> 01:21:00,809
That is,
I always called Josephine

1286
01:21:01,000 --> 01:21:02,684
I still have 30 years

1287
01:21:02,880 --> 01:21:05,486
and tonight
I start a diet.

1288
01:21:05,840 --> 01:21:08,446
A diet with plenty of Gilles.

1289
01:21:08,640 --> 01:21:13,640
...

1290
01:21:27,040 --> 01:21:29,805
Jojo? We run together
Thursday evening.

1291
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:32,651
This is astonishing,
she begins to like it.

1292
01:21:32,840 --> 01:21:35,366
But given the right
dishes Gilles,

1293
01:21:35,560 --> 01:21:38,166
it must prevent
to store everything in her ass.

1294
01:21:38,360 --> 01:21:40,044
I just said
a shit.

1295
01:21:40,240 --> 01:21:41,127
It is thanks to her.

1296
01:21:41,320 --> 01:21:43,368
She said
she never lie,

1297
01:21:43,560 --> 01:21:45,403
it would
never selfish.

1298
01:21:45,600 --> 01:21:47,762
Jo, it
really changed,

1299
01:21:47,960 --> 01:21:49,405
Gilles
him good.

1300
01:21:49,720 --> 01:21:53,281
I asked if Gilles
was not a gay brother.

1301
01:21:53,640 --> 01:21:55,165
He not inspire me,
its Gilles.

1302
01:21:55,360 --> 01:21:56,964
I could
let me.

1303
01:21:57,160 --> 01:21:59,766
I found an apartment '
in front of her home.

1304
01:21:59,960 --> 01:22:01,121
Finally, at home.

1305
01:22:01,320 --> 01:22:03,926
She teaches me
to be perfect.

1306
01:22:04,120 --> 01:22:05,565
We are accomplices.

1307
01:22:06,120 --> 01:22:07,963
I do not understand
she found him.

1308
01:22:08,160 --> 01:22:10,208
In bed
he knows how to do.

1309
01:22:10,400 --> 01:22:12,289

a pussy a pussy.

1311
01:22:15,240 --> 01:22:16,890
This is not possible.

1312
01:22:17,080 --> 01:22:18,889
