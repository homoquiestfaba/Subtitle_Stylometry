I told you, no people.

550
00:46:10,706 --> 00:46:12,458
- Try the finger.
- It won't work.

551
00:46:12,541 --> 00:46:14,668
- It always works.
- Not if he's hungry.

552
00:46:14,752 --> 00:46:16,170
- He's hungry?
- Yeah.

553
00:46:16,253 --> 00:46:18,297
- Then fucking feed him!
- I can't!

554
00:46:18,380 --> 00:46:19,757
What? Are-are you serious, Jean?

555
00:46:19,840 --> 00:46:22,259
- It's nothing I haven't seen before.
- I can't.

556
00:46:23,511 --> 00:46:24,720
(shushing quietly)

557
00:46:26,305 --> 00:46:28,224
(Harry fussing)

558
00:46:28,307 --> 00:46:30,309
(register beeping)

559
00:46:33,938 --> 00:46:35,940
(Harry crying)

560
00:46:40,486 --> 00:46:42,488
(Harry cooing)

561
00:46:50,663 --> 00:46:52,665
(traffic passing in distance)

562
00:47:21,277 --> 00:47:23,362
I can't have children.

563
00:47:25,531 --> 00:47:27,491
Eddie said he didn't care.

564
00:47:27,575 --> 00:47:30,244
That wasn't why he wanted me.

565
00:47:30,327 --> 00:47:33,664
He said he loved me
and we would figure it out.

566
00:47:35,666 --> 00:47:39,420
But we couldn't adopt
'cause of his record.

567
00:47:41,422 --> 00:47:43,048
Obviously.

568
00:47:47,386 --> 00:47:50,431
And then, one day,
he walks in with a baby.

569
00:47:54,184 --> 00:47:56,186
I said, "Who is that?"

570
00:47:59,189 --> 00:48:02,526
Eddie smiles and says,

571
00:48:02,610 --> 00:48:04,612
"He's our baby."

572
00:48:13,662 --> 00:48:16,290
This girl was in trouble.

573
00:48:16,373 --> 00:48:18,500
Eddie paid for everything.

574
00:48:18,584 --> 00:48:20,210
Best doctors, all of it.

575
00:48:20,294 --> 00:48:24,632
Her father was gonna disown her,
but Eddie put it right.

576
00:48:27,760 --> 00:48:30,888
Eddie said everybody's life
got saved that day.

577
00:48:41,190 --> 00:48:43,317
I think about his mother.

578
00:48:47,446 --> 00:48:49,448
I think about her all the time.

579
00:48:55,454 --> 00:48:57,539
Do you have anyone?

580
00:48:57,623 --> 00:48:59,249
(chuckles):
What?

581
00:49:02,169 --> 00:49:04,171
You wouldn't tell me anyway.

582
00:49:08,258 --> 00:49:10,386
Once I found out
I couldn't have a kid,

583
00:49:10,469 --> 00:49:13,305
I stopped wanting it.

584
00:49:13,389 --> 00:49:14,973
Thought maybe
it would be better.

585
00:49:17,935 --> 00:49:20,896
I shouldn't bring a baby
into a life like this.

586
00:49:21,939 --> 00:49:23,941
Eddie's a criminal.

587
00:49:26,026 --> 00:49:29,488
I told myself
that's why I kept losing them.

588
00:49:31,073 --> 00:49:33,492
That's why they wouldn't
stay with me.

589
00:49:41,083 --> 00:49:43,252
But I really did want it.

590
00:49:45,754 --> 00:49:47,756
More than anything.

591
00:49:51,051 --> 00:49:53,929
I just had to keep living,
you know?

592
00:49:54,012 --> 00:49:56,724
So I burned it all up.

593
00:49:58,475 --> 00:50:02,062
I burned it up till there was
nothing left but the fire.

594
00:50:07,151 --> 00:50:09,778
And then in walked Eddie
with a baby.

595
00:50:14,491 --> 00:50:16,410
(sniffles softly)

596
00:50:16,493 --> 00:50:17,911
(sighs)

597
00:50:17,995 --> 00:50:20,664
This is no place for a child.

598
00:50:20,748 --> 00:50:21,957
(sniffling)

599
00:50:27,421 --> 00:50:29,214
D-Does he laugh?

600
00:50:29,298 --> 00:50:31,341
What?

601
00:50:31,425 --> 00:50:33,010
Do you make him laugh?

602
00:50:33,093 --> 00:50:35,471
What the hell
are you talking about?

603
00:50:35,554 --> 00:50:37,473
If you've heard him laugh.

604
00:50:37,556 --> 00:50:39,558
You know.

605
00:50:39,641 --> 00:50:42,060
Course I've heard him laugh.

606
00:50:42,144 --> 00:50:43,979
Well, then you know.

607
00:50:49,485 --> 00:50:51,111
He laughs.

608
00:50:54,573 --> 00:50:56,575
Especially when I...

609
00:50:58,702 --> 00:51:00,370
What?

610
00:51:00,454 --> 00:51:01,663
(sniffles)

611
00:51:01,747 --> 00:51:03,248
When what?

612
00:51:06,877 --> 00:51:08,295
(sighs softly)

613
00:51:10,672 --> 00:51:13,967
I do this thing
when I'm singing.

614
00:51:14,051 --> 00:51:16,053
I don't know... he likes it.

615
00:51:16,136 --> 00:51:18,847
It happened and it worked,
so I kept doing it.

616
00:51:18,931 --> 00:51:21,517
It's not even
a song about babies.

617
00:51:24,394 --> 00:51:26,146
And now that
I'm talking about it,

618
00:51:26,230 --> 00:51:28,941
I'm realizing
it's actually pretty weird.

619
00:51:29,024 --> 00:51:31,318
Do it.

620
00:51:31,401 --> 00:51:33,445
He's asleep.

621
00:51:33,529 --> 00:51:34,905
I'll get the idea.

622
00:51:34,988 --> 00:51:36,198
Absolutely not.

623
00:51:36,281 --> 00:51:38,575
Fine.

but just in case...

676
00:54:41,675 --> 00:54:43,677
Move that chair.

677
00:54:49,433 --> 00:54:51,435
Move that one back.

678
00:54:54,104 --> 00:54:56,314
Grab the table,
move it that way.

679
00:55:19,838 --> 00:55:22,466
It was my hiding place.

681
00:55:27,596 --> 00:55:29,473

682

- Do you have a better idea?

684
00:55:37,731 --> 00:55:40,650
What about the money
at the house?

685
00:55:40,734 --> 00:55:42,402
That money's gone, Jean.

686
00:55:42,486 --> 00:55:44,321
Don't you have money?

687
00:55:44,404 --> 00:55:46,448
- Like Eddie?
- (sighs)

688
00:55:46,531 --> 00:55:49,201
I worked for Eddie.

689
00:55:49,284 --> 00:55:50,911
I'm not Eddie.

690
00:55:50,994 --> 00:55:52,829
So, what am I, a chore?

691
00:55:52,913 --> 00:55:54,748

693
00:56:09,346 --> 00:56:11,348
This isn't about you, Jean.

694
00:56:18,271 --> 00:56:20,023
Eddie killed the boss.

695
00:56:20,107 --> 00:56:21,900
Marvin.

696
00:56:21,983 --> 00:56:24,194
The night we left.

697
00:56:24,277 --> 00:56:28,782
Then Marvin's guys went over
to your place, killed Jimmy.

698
00:56:28,865 --> 00:56:30,992
Now no one knows what's what.

699
00:56:31,076 --> 00:56:32,494
It's just...

700
00:56:32,577 --> 00:56:34,412
The city's chaos.

701
00:56:36,456 --> 00:56:38,333
That's all I know.

702
00:56:42,963 --> 00:56:44,965
Eddie would never kill anyone.

703
00:56:48,760 --> 00:56:50,178
(sighs softly)

704
00:56:52,222 --> 00:56:54,224
Eddie's a killer, Jean.

705
00:56:55,976 --> 00:56:57,978
He has been for a long time.

706
00:57:11,324 --> 00:57:14,035
Where is he now?

707
00:57:14,119 --> 00:57:15,745
I don't know.

708
00:57:18,748 --> 00:57:20,375

709
00:57:24,838 --> 00:57:26,882
I-I really don't know.

710
00:57:51,865 --> 00:57:53,867
You do have someone.

711
00:57:58,330 --> 00:58:00,999
The someone who told you
those weren't good for you.

712
00:58:02,834 --> 00:58:05,837
And they told you that
because they love you.

713
00:58:23,813 --> 00:58:26,024
He didn't have a name.

714
00:58:29,277 --> 00:58:30,904
Harry.

715
00:58:32,280 --> 00:58:34,282
I named him Harry.

716
00:58:37,410 --> 00:58:40,455
No reason.
I-I just liked the name.

717
00:58:43,416 --> 00:58:47,045
When I was pregnant the longest,
I named the baby Harry.

718
00:58:51,341 --> 00:58:53,802
- I never told anyone.

When Paul was little,

826

we had to live in this old hotel
in the city for a while.

01:07:07,336 --> 01:07:09,338
Why?

830
01:07:09,422 --> 01:07:11,382
It was safe for us.

831
01:07:11,466 --> 01:07:14,260
It's Black-owned,
Black-operated.

832
01:07:14,343 --> 01:07:16,888
Place where people could go
to fix their lives.

(music playing quietly

834
01:07:18,598 --> 01:07:21,851
I mean, it was
kind of a in-between place.

835
01:07:23,352 --> 01:07:25,229
Not quite there yet,

836
01:07:25,313 --> 01:07:27,523
but better than
where they'd been.

837
01:07:29,525 --> 01:07:32,445
"Where there is despair,
I may bring hope."

You know
the Prayer of Saint Francis.

Sometimes the toilets
wouldn't flush.

843

But Paul loved it.

844
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:47,585
There was a phone in the hall.

845
01:07:47,668 --> 01:07:50,338
He'd run to it
every time it rang.

846
01:07:50,421 --> 01:07:52,965

870

Occupational hazard.

871
01:09:21,304 --> 01:09:23,514
I'm about to take out a gun.

872
01:09:31,439 --> 01:09:32,857
It's empty.

873
01:09:34,567 --> 01:09:36,402
You ever use one?

874
01:09:39,405 --> 01:09:42,742
All these men
and all their guns.

875
01:09:42,825 --> 01:09:45,661
My husband wouldn't even
let me drive the car.

876
01:09:46,746 --> 01:09:48,873
(chuckles)

877
01:09:48,956 --> 01:09:53,085
Listen, anyone can
learn to shoot.

878
01:09:53,169 --> 01:09:57,381
But the hard part is what you
actually do when the time comes.

879
01:09:58,382 --> 01:10:00,635
Now, when you practice,

880
01:10:00,718 --> 01:10:02,261
you pull the trigger...

881
01:10:02,345 --> 01:10:04,013
(gun clicks)

882
01:10:04,096 --> 01:10:07,725
...and you think about pressure
and alignment.

883
01:10:09,685 --> 01:10:12,229
But what you really need
to figure out is

884
01:10:12,313 --> 01:10:14,732
what you'll do when it's real.

885
01:10:19,028 --> 01:10:20,446
Here.

01:10:21,781 --> 01:10:23,407

(door opens, closes)

891
01:10:59,360 --> 01:11:01,946

You live in the city?

893
01:11:04,448 --> 01:11:05,658
Yeah.

894
01:11:05,741 --> 01:11:07,451
First, I thought
Cal was just paranoid,

895
01:11:07,535 --> 01:11:11,455
but after two more nights of it,
he packed up and sent us away.

896
01:11:11,539 --> 01:11:13,416
Said he'd be right behind us.

897
01:11:13,499 --> 01:11:17,545
I just thought you should be
prepared for what comes next.

898
01:11:19,213 --> 01:11:20,965
What comes next?

899
01:11:21,048 --> 01:11:23,259
I don't know yet.

900
01:11:23,342 --> 01:11:25,761

What?

906
01:11:56,292 --> 01:11:58,753
Eddie was your first husband.

907
01:12:04,341 --> 01:12:05,968
Art told you that?

908
01:12:08,429 --> 01:12:10,431
I put it together.

909
01:12:14,393 --> 01:12:16,604
Eddie did the same thing to you?

910
01:12:16,687 --> 01:12:18,105
Before Cal?

911
01:12:19,774 --> 01:12:21,942
Except it's worse

1094
01:28:58,396 --> 01:29:00,398
I think it even
scared him a little.

1095
01:29:02,609 --> 01:29:04,611
But he was always there.

1096
01:29:04,694 --> 01:29:07,906
Always... even.

1097
01:29:10,116 --> 01:29:11,910
We started
confiding in each other,

1098
01:29:11,993 --> 01:29:16,623
and eventually we fell in love.

1099
01:29:20,001 --> 01:29:22,962
It was Eddie
you were hiding from.

1100
01:29:23,046 --> 01:29:24,631
When you were here.

1101
01:29:28,468 --> 01:29:30,470
We came without a plan.

1102
01:29:32,430 --> 01:29:35,350
We got restless, and we left.

1103
01:29:35,433 --> 01:29:38,353
That's when Eddie found us.

1104
01:29:38,436 --> 01:29:41,439
He loved us too much to hurt us,
but he wasn't gonna let us go

1105
01:29:41,523 --> 01:29:44,275
without getting
something in return.

1106
01:29:44,359 --> 01:29:47,320
So we made a deal.

1107
01:29:47,403 --> 01:29:50,490
We would get to be together.

1108
01:29:50,573 --> 01:29:52,784
We could get out.

1109
01:29:55,161 --> 01:29:58,331
But one day Eddie would call,

1110
01:29:58,414 --> 01:30:01,668
and Cal wouldn't be able
to say no.

1111
01:30:04,671 --> 01:30:06,297
That was me.

1112
01:30:08,299 --> 01:30:09,926
That was you.

1113
01:30:16,683 --> 01:30:21,020
I work at the university,
and Cal's at a moving company.

1114
01:30:22,480 --> 01:30:24,732
Paul thinks he's his dad.

1115
01:30:24,816 --> 01:30:27,819
- (pouring coffee)
- And a really good one.

1116
01:30:34,951 --> 01:30:37,912
As time went on, we thought
it might really be over.

1117
01:30:37,996 --> 01:30:42,125
That we might really have...
gotten out.

1118
01:30:43,209 --> 01:30:44,836
We put the past in a box,

1119
01:30:44,919 --> 01:30:48,715
and we put that box
in a secret drawer.

1120
01:30:50,341 --> 01:30:52,886
And we thought
that maybe it would just...

1121
01:30:54,929 --> 01:30:56,347
...disappear.

1122
01:31:00,476 --> 01:31:02,228
I'm so sorry.

1123
01:31:05,023 --> 01:31:06,441
(sighs softly)

1124
01:31:10,028 --> 01:31:11,571
That guy Mike at the club...

1125
01:31:11,654 --> 01:31:14,115
He's a real piece of shit,
always has been.

1126
01:31:14,199 --> 01:31:16,117
And I knew it would be
dangerous there.

1127
01:31:16,201 --> 01:31:19,454
Things have been like that
since Eddie killed Marvin.

1128
01:31:19,537 --> 01:31:22,874
But going there was
the best option we had.

1129
01:31:22,957 --> 01:31:25,210
What do you mean?

1130
01:31:25,293 --> 01:31:28,630
If I'm right, word will
get to Cal that I'm in the city,

1131
01:31:28,713 --> 01:31:31,466
and once Cal knows that,
he'll find us.

1132
01:31:36,471 --> 01:31:38,640
Mike works with Eddie?

1133
01:31:38,723 --> 01:31:41,267
They did some jobs together.

1134
01:31:41,351 --> 01:31:43,353
Then Eddie shot his ear off.

1135
01:31:51,569 --> 01:31:53,988
Mike called you "Firecracker."

1136
01:31:56,908 --> 01:31:58,034
Was that...?

1137
01:31:58,117 --> 01:32:00,453
Don't tell me...

1138
01:32:13,508 --> 01:32:15,593

1139
01:32:15,677 --> 01:32:18,054
