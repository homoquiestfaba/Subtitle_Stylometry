I'm sexy, I知 cute
I知 popular to boot

2
00:00:16,099 --> 00:00:19,686
I'm bitchin', great hair
The boys all love to stare

00:00:19,811 --> 00:00:22,981
I'm wanted, I知 hot
I知 everything you're not

00:00:23,023 --> 00:00:26,568
I'm pretty, I知 cool
I dominate this school

5
00:00:26,652 --> 00:00:30,030
Who am l, just guess
Guys wanna touch my chest

6
00:00:30,113 --> 00:00:33,659
I'm rockin', I smile
And many think I知 vile

7
00:00:33,742 --> 00:00:37,120
I'm flyin', I jump
You can look but

8
00:00:37,246 --> 00:00:40,499
I'm major, I roar
I swear I知 not a whore

9
00:00:40,582 --> 00:00:44,419
We cheer and we lead
We act like we're on speed

10
00:00:44,503 --> 00:00:47,506
Hate us 'cause we're beautiful
Well, we don't like you either

11
00:00:47,631 --> 00:00:51,051
We're cheerleaders
We are cheerleaders
Uh-huh

12
00:00:51,176 --> 00:00:54,555

13
00:00:54,638 --> 00:00:58,058

00:00:58,183 --> 00:01:01,728
- I'm Big Bad Carver, yeah
- Just call me Kasey

15
00:01:01,854 --> 00:01:05,274
I'm still Big Red

16
00:01:05,399 --> 00:01:08,861
I sizzle, I scorch
But now I pass the torch

17
00:01:08,986 --> 00:01:12,281
The ballots are in
and one girl had to win

18
00:01:12,406 --> 00:01:15,492
She's perky, she's fun
and now she's number one

19
00:01:15,617 --> 00:01:18,537
K-K-Kick it, Torrance

21
00:01:34,178 --> 00:01:38,432
I'm T-T-T-Torrance
Your captain Torrance

22
00:01:38,557 --> 00:01:41,935
Let's go, Toros

23
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:45,314
We are the Toros
The fighting, mighty Toros

24
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:48,859
We're so terrific
we must be Toros

25
00:01:48,942 --> 00:01:50,944
Yea!
Go, Toros!

26
00:01:51,069 --> 00:01:52,988
Yea, come on!
Toros!

27
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:57,242
- Yeah! All right!
- Go, Toros!

28
00:01:57,367 --> 00:02:00,037
- Oh, my God!

29
00:02:00,162 --> 00:02:04,541
Nice rack! Oh, baby!

30
00:02:04,666 --> 00:02:07,044
Serves her right!

31
00:02:07,127 --> 00:02:10,839
Check out the hooters!

32
00:02:21,725 --> 00:02:23,977
Oh, shit.

33
00:02:24,728 --> 00:02:37,241
Los PiRaTaS 2002
*** by Maximus ***

34
00:02:37,449 --> 00:02:39,868
Hey, hey,
Mr. and Mrs. "S."

35
00:02:39,952 --> 00:02:42,955
Oh, look, it's Aaron.
Oh. Hello, Aaron.

36
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:46,834
- Hey, can I help?
- Oh, no. We're fine, thanks.
Really. Stay in your vehicle.

37
00:02:46,875 --> 00:02:49,670
Nuh, nuh, nuh.
You sure?

38
00:02:49,753 --> 00:02:52,756
Bye! Be back later!
Bye, honey.

39
00:02:52,881 --> 00:02:54,800
Hi.

40
00:02:57,761 --> 00:03:01,932
Come on, Tor.
Can't mack on you
in front of the parentals.

41
00:03:02,015 --> 00:03:07,104
- Bye-bye!

42
00:03:10,941 --> 00:03:12,860
Remember,
he's leaving for college.

43
00:03:12,943 --> 00:03:14,862
Right.

44
00:03:17,072 --> 00:03:19,533
- So are you excited?
- Oh, yeah!

45
00:03:19,658 --> 00:03:23,287
It's college, Tor.
I'm really stoked,
you know?

46
00:03:23,412 --> 00:03:27,124
It's just, you know,
I知 gonna miss you.

47
00:03:27,249 --> 00:03:29,293
Really?
Yeah.

48
00:03:29,418 --> 00:03:34,840
But next year, it'll be
you and me reunited at
Cal State Dominguez Hills.

49
00:03:34,923 --> 00:03:38,594
I'll be the experienced
so pho more, you'll be
the hot, new freshman.

50
00:03:38,677 --> 00:03:43,015
Yup. It'll be
just like high school,
only better.

51
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:45,017
Dorm rooms.

52
00:03:59,948 --> 00:04:02,117
I got the door, Tor.
Okay.

53
00:04:02,201 --> 00:04:04,203
I got the door, Tor.

54
00:04:04,328 --> 00:04:07,581
What's up, Aaron?
Hey, what up, buddy?

55
00:04:07,706 --> 00:04:09,583
Hey!
Yeah!

56
00:04:09,708 --> 00:04:13,128
Hey, hey, remember,
when you get captain,
act surprised, okay?

57
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:17,341
- Don't jinx me.
- Hi, Torrance.
Hey, Aaron.

58
00:04:17,466 --> 00:04:20,469
- Ah, ladies. Thank you.
- Good luck at school.

59
00:04:20,594 --> 00:04:23,222
Oh, Aaron, come
to one last practice?

60
00:04:23,347 --> 00:04:25,641
You know you're still
my favorite cheerleader.

61
00:04:25,682 --> 00:04:28,602
Oh, I知 sorry, guys.
I gotta run.
Please?

62
00:04:28,644 --> 00:04:31,480
You're not staying
for the vote?
I really gotta beat traffic.

63
00:04:31,522 --> 00:04:34,441
I can't be late
for orientation. Hey.
But I really want...

64
00:04:34,483 --> 00:04:38,904
Hey. Trust me.
You're gonna get it.

65
00:04:40,197 --> 00:04:42,115
Bye-bye.
Bye.

66
00:04:47,788 --> 00:04:49,706
Did you vote?
Oh, yeah.

67
00:04:49,831 --> 00:04:52,584
Darcy thinks she should
get captain'cause her dad
pays for everything.

68
00:04:52,668 --> 00:04:55,337
He should use
some of that money
to buy her a clue.

69
00:04:57,047 --> 00:04:59,842
Courtney'll get captain.
The guys love
clutching her butt.

70
00:04:59,925 --> 00:05:04,429
She's got a lot to hang on to.
What's plural for "butt"?
On one person, I mean.

71
00:05:04,555 --> 00:05:07,099
She puts the "ass"
in "massive."

72
00:05:07,224 --> 00:05:09,685
You put the "lude"
in "deluded."
Yo!

73
00:05:09,726 --> 00:05:11,854
Can I have
all your votes?

74
00:05:11,937 --> 00:05:13,939
Mine.
Here's me.

75
00:05:17,651 --> 00:05:19,570
Thank you.

76
00:05:19,653 --> 00:05:22,573
We should get Big Red a gift,
or at least someone
should say something.

77
00:05:22,656 --> 00:05:24,575
Pass.
Good riddance.

78
00:05:24,658 --> 00:05:26,827
I don't believe in osmos is.
It's not brown-nosing.

79
00:05:26,952 --> 00:05:29,580
She's the departing captain.
She did a lot for this squad.

80
00:05:29,663 --> 00:05:33,083
Oh, come on.
Both of you sucked before
she whipped you into shape.

81
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:35,210
Oh, whipped?
Is that what that was?

82
00:05:35,294 --> 00:05:38,130
No one will miss Big Red, Tor.
She puts the "itch" in "bitch."

83
00:05:38,255 --> 00:05:40,716
She puts the "whore "
in "horrifying. "

84
00:05:40,841 --> 00:05:43,302
You  know,
it's her last practice.
How would you feel?

85
00:05:43,385 --> 00:05:45,762
Big Red
has no feelings.
Just testicles.

86
00:05:45,888 --> 00:05:50,309
You guys are all
great athletes.

87
00:05:50,392 --> 00:05:54,521
Thanks in large part to me.

88
00:05:54,605 --> 00:05:59,526
And I know that
your new captain will
keep the tradition alive,

89
00:05:59,610 --> 00:06:01,987
Leading you to the record
sixth national...

90
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:04,740
cheerleading championship
you know is yours.

91
00:06:04,865 --> 00:06:09,119
So, let's meet
your new leader,

92
00:06:09,244 --> 00:06:13,415
- Torrance Shipman.
Oh, my God!

93
00:06:13,498 --> 00:06:16,460
Oh, Les!
Oh, my God!

94
00:06:16,543 --> 00:06:20,214
- That slut.
Listen up!
I'd like to try a wolf wall.

95
00:06:20,339 --> 00:06:23,634
Oh, excellent!
Torrance has got
the fever, people.

96
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:25,636
What's a wolf's wall?

97
00:06:25,761 --> 00:06:28,430
Only the hardest pyramid
known to cheer leading
and mankind.

98
00:06:28,555 --> 00:06:30,849
The words
"big" and "britches"
come to mind.

99
00:06:30,933 --> 00:06:32,893
She's crazy.
She'll kill us all.

100
00:06:32,976 --> 00:06:36,480
Hello! Some of us have
not spent the entire
summer working out.

101
00:06:36,605 --> 00:06:39,858
Right, Carver?
Come on, guys!
Let's be different for once.

102
00:06:39,983 --> 00:06:41,860
We can't just rest
on our laurels.

103
00:06:41,985 --> 00:06:44,571
Why does everybody say that?
Maybe a laurel's
a good place to rest.

104
00:06:44,655 --> 00:06:48,075
Come on, man.
You guys suck.
Let's do this.

105
00:06:50,369 --> 00:06:52,246
One, two, three, four,

106
00:06:52,371 --> 00:06:54,665
five, six, seven, eight...

107
00:06:54,748 --> 00:06:58,919
Five, six, seven, eight.
Kick one...

108
00:06:59,002 --> 00:07:02,005
Five, six, seven, eight.
And one! Stick it!

109
00:07:02,089 --> 00:07:04,800
Come on, girls!
Stick it for me!

110
00:07:04,925 --> 00:07:07,386
Five, six, seven, eight.

111
00:07:07,511 --> 00:07:11,223
Go one, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.
Kick one!

112
00:07:11,348 --> 00:07:14,685
- Good job! Whoo!
- Pinch some panties.
Someone's slackin'.

113
00:07:14,768 --> 00:07:17,855
Do I look like a milk maid,
'cause somebody feels
like a cow!

114
00:07:17,938 --> 00:07:21,608
- Carver, can you cradle out?
- You bet I can.

115
00:07:21,733 --> 00:07:24,319
Okay, ready?
One, two, down, up!

116
00:07:24,444 --> 00:07:27,406
- Carver!

117
00:07:33,245 --> 00:07:36,206
Carver?
Are you okay?

118
00:07:36,331 --> 00:07:38,208
I'm fine, really.

119
00:07:38,333 --> 00:07:40,919
Don't you guys
worry about me.
It's just a scratch.

120
00:07:41,044 --> 00:07:42,921
I'll be back to practice
tomorrow,

121
00:07:43,046 --> 00:07:44,923
so don't you guys fret,
okay?

122
00:07:45,048 --> 00:07:48,635
And I don't want you
to worry at all,
because I知 a quick healer.

123
00:07:48,719 --> 00:07:50,929
I promise, you guys.
I'm gonna be there
for you.

124
00:07:51,054 --> 00:07:53,056
You hear me?

125
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:56,518
Guys? Bye!

126
00:08:01,148 --> 00:08:03,025
I got captain.

127
00:08:03,150 --> 00:08:05,944
Yeah, and you sent
a girl to the hospital
on your first day.

128
00:08:06,028 --> 00:08:09,823
- Aye, aye, Captain!
- You were listening
on the phone? Mom!

129
00:08:09,865 --> 00:08:13,994
It's true. She really should
get her own private line,
you know.

130
00:08:14,119 --> 00:08:16,622
She's growing up so fast.

131
00:08:16,663 --> 00:08:19,458
Justin, go away.

132
00:08:19,583 --> 00:08:21,877
At ease, Captain.

133
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:25,547
Well, this blistering
academic schedule
shouldn't get in your way.

134
00:08:25,672 --> 00:08:27,549
You should be happy about that.

135
00:08:27,674 --> 00:08:30,302
Why can't you
accept the fact
that I知 not a genius?

136
00:08:30,344 --> 00:08:32,304
It just kills you that
I知 not an honor student.

137
00:08:32,387 --> 00:08:34,973
No. It kills me that you
barely make time to study.

138
00:08:35,098 --> 00:08:39,353
If you studied
half as much as you cheer,
you'd be in great shape.

139
00:08:39,436 --> 00:08:41,855
Your priorities are...
No! Those are
your priorities!

140
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:44,066
Mine are just fine.
Look,

141
00:08:44,191 --> 00:08:47,194
I'm just saying that
college might be
less of a shock...

142
00:08:47,319 --> 00:08:51,698
if you take an extra lab
or language course
or something.

143
00:08:51,823 --> 00:08:55,035
- What do you think?
- Will Advanced Chem
get you off my back?

144
00:08:55,118 --> 00:08:57,454
Not completely,
but it'll help.

145
00:08:57,538 --> 00:08:59,540
Done.

146
00:08:59,623 --> 00:09:04,086
You know, mothers have killed
to get their daughters
on squads.

147
00:09:04,169 --> 00:09:06,338
That mother
didn't kill anyone.
She hired a hit man.

148
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:21,937
Everyone, we have
a new student...

149
00:09:22,062 --> 00:09:25,023
transferring from
Mission Hills High School
in LosAngeles.

150
00:09:25,148 --> 00:09:29,528
Please welcome
Cliff "Pant One."

151
00:09:29,653 --> 00:09:31,530
Pantone.

152
00:09:31,655 --> 00:09:34,700
- Thanks.

153
00:09:37,911 --> 00:09:40,497
Loser!

154
00:09:44,376 --> 00:09:46,461
Loser!

155
00:09:48,297 --> 00:09:50,966
Wait, wait, wait.
Was that, uh...

156
00:09:51,049 --> 00:09:53,510
Was that the loser sneeze
I just heard right there?

157
00:09:53,594 --> 00:09:57,514
Guys, come on.
I mean, what is that,
from like the 1900s?

158
00:09:57,639 --> 00:10:01,560
Nobody does that anymore.
I don't think anybody does.

159
00:10:01,643 --> 00:10:04,688
When I lived in Kentucky...
Did they still do
the loser sneeze in Kentucky?

160
00:10:04,813 --> 00:10:07,441
No. They had, uh,
guns and homemade bombs.

161
00:10:07,566 --> 00:10:11,737
What about L.A.?
There was attitude in L.A.,
but no loser sneeze.

162
00:10:11,862 --> 00:10:14,990
I'm pretty sure
the loser sneeze
is officially dead.

163
00:10:15,073 --> 00:10:17,075
Sorry.

164
00:10:21,455 --> 00:10:23,707
Nice.

165
00:10:23,832 --> 00:10:27,503
I don't think
they got the memo
about the loser sneeze.

166
00:10:27,628 --> 00:10:30,672
Uh, no, apparently not.

167
00:10:30,756 --> 00:10:32,758
Cliff.

168
00:10:32,841 --> 00:10:36,678
- Torrance.
- Advanced Chem.

169
00:10:36,803 --> 00:10:41,934
Yikes.
Um, afraid so.
Are you intimidated?

170
00:10:42,059 --> 00:10:44,353
Y-Yeah, a little.

171
00:10:44,436 --> 00:10:47,105
- Really?
- No, not really.

172
00:10:48,607 --> 00:10:50,526
So, is that your band
or something?

173
00:10:52,903 --> 00:10:55,197
The Clash? No, uh...

174
00:10:55,322 --> 00:11:00,327
It's a British punk band,
circa 1977 to 1983-ish.

175
00:11:00,452 --> 00:11:03,539
- Original line up, anyway.
- How vintage.

176
00:11:10,045 --> 00:11:12,422
Um, so I'll
see you around then?

177
00:11:12,506 --> 00:11:16,134
Looks like it.

178
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:18,595
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

179
00:11:18,679 --> 00:11:20,973
Whoa! It's sexy Leslie...

180
00:11:21,098 --> 00:11:23,934
and Jan,Jan,
the cheerleading man.
Hey, fags.

181
00:11:24,059 --> 00:11:27,062
Just because we won
more trophies
than you guys,

182
00:11:27,187 --> 00:11:29,398
that's no reason
to go get all malignant.

183
00:11:29,481 --> 00:11:32,025
Malignant this, tool.

184
00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:34,611
All right.
Right on!

185
00:11:34,736 --> 00:11:36,613
One oft hese days, man.
Let it go.

186
00:11:36,738 --> 00:11:38,740
They never even won
a single game.

187
00:11:38,866 --> 00:11:42,327
Gotta be kind
of rough on 'em.
Besides, they're dicks.

188
00:11:42,452 --> 00:11:44,746
Les, tell me you have
Advanced Chem
first period.

189
00:11:44,872 --> 00:11:48,166
Advanced Chem, first period.
If you have a lab partner
already, I知 screwed.

190
00:11:48,292 --> 00:11:50,169
Torrance, it's only
the second day ofschool,

191
00:11:50,294 --> 00:11:54,506
and your academic
insecurity bit
is completely tired.

192
00:11:54,590 --> 00:11:58,886
You know, everyone's
saying your ambition
broke Carver's leg.

193
00:11:58,969 --> 00:12:01,889
When, really, it was
the ankle she slammed
into the ground.

194
00:12:01,972 --> 00:12:04,766
Kasey did a massive
E-mail last night.
Misspelled "leg."

195
00:12:04,850 --> 00:12:07,603
Shut up!
Two G's.

196
00:12:07,728 --> 00:12:11,273
Apparently, Carver
gets home schooling
for the next three months.

197
00:12:11,398 --> 00:12:14,318
I'm cursed.
Replacing her is
gonna be a nightmare.

198
00:12:14,443 --> 00:12:17,571
Well, that's why you're
the captain, Captain.

199
00:12:17,654 --> 00:12:17,821
Bring on the tyros,
the neophytes
and the dilettanti.

200
00:12:17,821 --> 00:12:20,866
Bring on the tyros,
the neophytes
and the dilettanti.

201
00:12:20,949 --> 00:12:24,244
S.A.T.'s are over, Darcy.
And you're still jealous
of my score.

202
00:12:24,328 --> 00:12:26,205
Are we sure Carver's
not malingering?

203
00:12:26,330 --> 00:12:29,249
Carver will strictly be
cheering in Special Olympics
until March.

204
00:12:29,333 --> 00:12:31,293
Nationals are February 10th.

205
00:12:31,376 --> 00:12:34,463
Regionals are in, like,
four weeks. I talked to her.
She's cool with this.

206
00:12:34,588 --> 00:12:37,883
Don't tell me Carver can
cut school just because she
broke her leg in three places.

207
00:12:37,966 --> 00:12:41,178
Hello!
Get a wheelchair!
That lucky bitch.

208
00:12:41,261 --> 00:12:44,681
Tell me we're not actually
continuing this masquerade
and having tryouts.

209
00:12:44,806 --> 00:12:47,434
Let's cut the crap
and pick somebody now.

210
00:12:47,559 --> 00:12:49,937
Whitney's little sister Jamie
is really teeny.

211
00:12:50,062 --> 00:12:51,939
She'll be easy to toss,
and she doesn't give lip.

212
00:12:52,064 --> 00:12:54,316
Just tongue.
Kiss my ass,Jan.

213
00:12:54,441 --> 00:12:56,485
I'd love to.
Ifshe's the best,
Jamie's got it.

214
00:12:56,568 --> 00:12:58,487
But we have to see
everyone.

215
00:12:58,570 --> 00:13:01,406
Ready, okay.

216
00:13:01,490 --> 00:13:04,368
Wait. Hold on.
Let me try that again.
That was terrible.

217
00:13:04,409 --> 00:13:08,413
Ready, okay!
Go, team...

218
00:13:09,998 --> 00:13:12,918
Ready, okay! Sorry.

219
00:13:13,043 --> 00:13:16,755
Ready, okay! Shit.

220
00:13:16,839 --> 00:13:20,592
Be aggressive.
Be, be aggressive.

221
00:13:20,676 --> 00:13:23,262
How many cheers
do we have to memorize?
Do we get paid for this?

222
00:13:23,387 --> 00:13:25,806
And do I have to
provide my own uniform?

223
00:13:33,397 --> 00:13:36,900
I see you guys are
wearing red. Um, that
does not work for me.

224
00:13:36,984 --> 00:13:42,573
Ready, okay! R-C-H!

225
00:13:42,698 --> 00:13:45,909
Toros all the way!

226
00:13:46,034 --> 00:13:49,580
I'm sorry. I just broke up
with my boyfriend.

227
00:13:53,333 --> 00:13:55,919
Pretty good.

228
00:14:00,883 --> 00:14:06,180
Yo, yo, yo!
What's up? What's up?
It's time to get busy!

229
00:14:06,305 --> 00:14:11,602
So let's kick this shit
and rock the C.K.
off your panties, yeah.

230
00:14:11,727 --> 00:14:15,439
Give my regards
to Broadway

231
00:14:15,564 --> 00:14:18,692
Remember me
to Herald Square

232
00:14:18,775 --> 00:14:21,904
Tell all the gang...
Excuse me!

233
00:14:22,029 --> 00:14:24,615
What's with the song?

234
00:14:24,698 --> 00:14:29,203
- Isn't this the audition
for Pippin?
- No.

235
00:14:31,914 --> 00:14:34,750
Taste so good
Make a grown man cry

236
00:14:34,875 --> 00:14:37,836
Sweet cherry pie, yeah

237
00:14:41,632 --> 00:14:44,510
Whoo

238
00:14:44,593 --> 00:14:47,137
Hi.

239
00:14:47,262 --> 00:14:51,016
Well, swingin 'on
the front porch
Swingin 'on the lawn

240
00:14:51,099 --> 00:14:54,019
Swingin ' where we want
'cause there ain 't
nobody home

241
00:14:55,687 --> 00:14:58,815
Okay, uh,
any more questions?
I think we're good.

242
00:15:00,442 --> 00:15:03,862
- Here's our girl.
- Rancho Carne's
not all talk

243
00:15:05,322 --> 00:15:07,199
All we know is
Toros rock

244
00:15:08,492 --> 00:15:11,870
Shake their booties
Scream and shout

245
00:15:11,954 --> 00:15:14,665
Toro players work it out

246
00:15:16,124 --> 00:15:18,001
Go, Toros.

247
00:15:24,967 --> 00:15:28,220
Do I have to wear
those little underwear things?
I don't like wearing underwear.

248
00:15:28,262 --> 00:15:30,931
- Thanks!

249
00:15:41,650 --> 00:15:44,152
Excuse me. Where'd you
park your Harley?

250
00:15:44,278 --> 00:15:46,822
Get real.

251
00:15:46,905 --> 00:15:51,118
Tattoos are strictly
verboten. Sorry.

252
00:16:00,419 --> 00:16:02,337
I got bored during
fourth period.

253
00:16:02,421 --> 00:16:05,007
You need to fill
one of these out.

254
00:16:05,132 --> 00:16:07,843
Did it.

255
00:16:12,222 --> 00:16:14,892
Missy, is it?

256
00:16:15,017 --> 00:16:18,395
Okay, before we start,
I知 afraid we're gonna
need to make sure...

257
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:20,647
you can do
a standing back tuck.

258
00:16:20,731 --> 00:16:22,858
Standard procedure.
You understand.

259
00:16:22,941 --> 00:16:26,570
Standing back handspring
back tuck okay?

260
00:16:35,162 --> 00:16:37,915
Where's this girl from,
Romania?

261
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:41,335
- Can she yell?
- We'll tryan oldie.

262
00:16:41,460 --> 00:16:44,963
Awesome, oh, wow!
Like, totally freak me out!
I mean, right on!

263
00:16:45,088 --> 00:16:48,467
The Toros sure are
number one.

264
00:16:50,177 --> 00:16:53,138
I transferred from Los Angeles!
Your school has no gymnastics team!

265
00:16:53,263 --> 00:16:55,432
This is a last resort!

266
00:16:58,352 --> 00:17:00,437
Okay, so I've never
cheered before. So what?

267
00:17:00,562 --> 00:17:03,482
How about something that
actually requires neurons?

268
00:17:03,565 --> 00:17:06,401
Do it.
Front handspring, step out,
round off, back handspring,

269
00:17:06,527 --> 00:17:08,779
step out, round off,
back handspring,

270
00:17:08,862 --> 00:17:11,448
full twisting lay out.

271
00:17:34,930 --> 00:17:37,182
- Ha!
- Hey!

272
00:17:37,307 --> 00:17:39,226
Missy is bank.

273
00:17:39,309 --> 00:17:42,271
Uh, bankrupt.
We've already
so decided on Jamie.

274
00:17:42,354 --> 00:17:45,566
Courtney, this is not
a democracy.
It's a "cheerocracy. "

275
00:17:45,649 --> 00:17:47,693
I'm sorry,
but I知 overruling you.

276
00:17:47,818 --> 00:17:51,196
You are being a "cheertator,"
Torrance, and a pain in my ass!

277
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:53,740
We already voted.

278
00:17:53,866 --> 00:17:57,536
Besides, Missy
looks like an uber dyke.

279
00:18:02,916 --> 00:18:05,919
Courtney, I知 the captain.

280
00:18:06,044 --> 00:18:08,630
I'm pulling rank,
and you can fall in line or not.

281
00:18:08,714 --> 00:18:11,925
If we're gonna be the best,
we have to have the best.

282
00:18:12,009 --> 00:18:14,386
Missy's the poo.
So take a big whiff.

283
00:18:28,734 --> 00:18:30,903
You.
And you.

284
00:18:31,028 --> 00:18:34,698
I mean, hi. I'm...
A cheerleader.

285
00:18:34,781 --> 00:18:37,993
Uh, yeah.
Head cheerleader,
to be exact.

286
00:18:38,076 --> 00:18:40,078
Wow.

287
00:18:40,162 --> 00:18:44,333
So does Missy live here?
Uh, actually, she moved
back to L.A., yeah.

288
00:18:44,416 --> 00:18:48,086
Something about
evil cheerleaders or...
Look, I知 serious.

289
00:18:48,212 --> 00:18:51,173
We have to get her.
Is her drug dependency
gonna be a problem?

290
00:18:51,298 --> 00:18:54,009
Cliff, shut up.
What doyou want?

291
00:18:54,134 --> 00:18:56,094
I want you on the squad.

292
00:18:56,220 --> 00:18:58,639
You're the best.
They know it.

293
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:00,766
They just reject
the unfamiliar.

294
00:19:00,891 --> 00:19:04,978
Thanks, but no, thanks.
I mean, I plead
temporary insanity.

295
00:19:05,103 --> 00:19:06,980
See, I知 a hard-core gymnast.

296
00:19:07,105 --> 00:19:11,360
No way jumping up and down,
screaming, "Go, team, go!"
is gonna satisfy me.

297
00:19:11,485 --> 00:19:14,571
Look, we're gymnasts too,
except no beam,
no bars, no vault.

298
00:19:14,696 --> 00:19:17,157
Sorry. Not interested.

299
00:19:17,241 --> 00:19:20,077
What are you doing?
Nothin'.

300
00:19:20,202 --> 00:19:24,373
I just thought that
it was interesting hearing
Torrance's point of view.

301
00:19:24,456 --> 00:19:27,376
- How do you even know her?
- We're old friends.

302
00:19:29,169 --> 00:19:31,046
Ever been to
a cheerleading competition?

303
00:19:31,171 --> 00:19:34,758
- Oh, you mean
like a football game?
- No, not a game.

304
00:19:34,883 --> 00:19:36,760
Those are like
practices for us.

305
00:19:36,844 --> 00:19:38,846
I'm talking about
a tournament.

306
00:19:38,971 --> 00:19:42,432
ESPN cameras all around,
hundreds of people
in the crowds cheering.

307
00:19:42,558 --> 00:19:46,103
Wait. People cheering
cheerleaders?

308
00:19:46,186 --> 00:19:49,106
That's right.
Lots of people.

309
00:19:49,189 --> 00:19:52,484
Here's the deal, Missy.
We're the shit. The best.

310
00:19:52,568 --> 00:19:55,779
We have fun, we work hard,
and we win national championships.

311
00:19:55,904 --> 00:19:58,574
I'm offering you a chance
to be a part ofthat.

312
00:19:58,657 --> 00:20:02,286
Think about it, Miss.
You get to wear
sassy outfits.

313
00:20:02,411 --> 00:20:05,998
You get to yell
like you care
about something.

314
00:20:06,123 --> 00:20:08,041
She's not the cheering type.

315
00:20:10,085 --> 00:20:12,296
You know what?

316
00:20:12,421 --> 00:20:15,257
Count me in.

317
00:20:17,593 --> 00:20:20,137
Ready, girls?

318
00:20:20,262 --> 00:20:24,933
I said brrr
It's cold in here

319
00:20:25,017 --> 00:20:28,103
I said there must be some
Toros in the atmosphere

320
00:20:28,228 --> 00:20:31,523
I said brrr
It痴 cold in here

321
00:20:31,648 --> 00:20:34,651
I said there must be some
Toros in the atmosphere

322
00:20:34,776 --> 00:20:38,030
I said oh-ee, oh-ee, oh
lce, ice, ice

323
00:20:38,113 --> 00:20:40,949
Oh-ee, oh-ee, oh
lce, ice, ice

324
00:20:41,074 --> 00:20:44,453
- Here we go, girls.

325
00:20:50,751 --> 00:20:52,753
Hey, practice isn 't over yet.

326
00:20:52,878 --> 00:20:55,464
Nice recruit, Torrance.

327
00:20:55,589 --> 00:20:58,884
A real captain would've
seen what I saw:
a big dykey loser.

328
00:20:59,009 --> 00:21:01,970
I'd say
that's strike two.

329
00:21:09,144 --> 00:21:12,231
What is up?
I went out on a limb for you,
and you bail?

330
00:21:12,314 --> 00:21:14,858
- I'm not about stealing.
- What are you talking about?

331
00:21:14,983 --> 00:21:17,027
You ripped off
those cheers.

332
00:21:17,110 --> 00:21:21,156
Listen, Missy, our cheers
are 100% original.
Count the trophies.

333
00:21:21,281 --> 00:21:24,326
Well, your trophies
are bullshit, because
you're a sad-ass liar.

334
00:21:24,451 --> 00:21:27,371
All right, that's it!
Get out of the car!
I'm gonna kick your ass!

335
00:21:27,412 --> 00:21:30,374
Oh, really?

336
00:21:31,792 --> 00:21:33,669
Come on.

337
00:21:35,003 --> 00:21:37,214
You're in for
a rude awakening.

338
00:21:37,339 --> 00:21:39,716
Get in.
What? No way.

339
00:21:39,842 --> 00:21:42,052
For real. Get in.

340
00:22:14,918 --> 00:22:17,462
Do your thing, Isis!

341
00:22:17,588 --> 00:22:22,050
I said brrr
It's cold in here

342
00:22:22,134 --> 00:22:25,721
There must be some
Clovers in the atmosphere

343
00:22:25,846 --> 00:22:28,765
I said brrr
It's cold in here

344
00:22:28,891 --> 00:22:32,311
There must be some
Clovers in the atmosphere

345
00:22:32,394 --> 00:22:35,397
I said oh-ee, oh-ee, oh
lce, ice, ice

346
00:22:35,522 --> 00:22:38,567
Slow it down
Oh-ee, oh-ee, oh

347
00:22:38,692 --> 00:22:41,111
Ice, ice, ice
Here we go

348
00:23:21,652 --> 00:23:24,780
Hey! You guys
enjoy the show?

349
00:23:24,863 --> 00:23:28,200
Yes, were
the ethnic festivities
to your liking today?

350
00:23:28,283 --> 00:23:31,954
- You guys are awesome.
- Really? Ready to share
those trophies?

351
00:23:32,079 --> 00:23:34,831
Can we just beat
these Buffys down
so I can go home?

352
00:23:34,915 --> 00:23:37,084
I'm on curfew, girl.

353
00:23:37,209 --> 00:23:39,294
- There's no need for that.
- She's right.

354
00:23:39,378 --> 00:23:41,338
See, then we'd be
doing them a favor.

355
00:23:41,421 --> 00:23:44,508
Then they could feel good
about sending Raggedy Ann here
to jack us for our cheers.

356
00:23:44,633 --> 00:23:48,804
- Raggedy Ann?
- Ugly redhead with a video
camera attached to her hand.

357
00:23:48,929 --> 00:23:51,056
Y'all been coming up here
for years, trying to steal
our routines.

358
00:23:51,181 --> 00:23:55,102
- And we just love
seeing them on ESPN.
- What are you talking about?

359
00:23:55,185 --> 00:23:57,646
"Brr, it's cold in here.
I said there must be some
Toros in the atmosphere"?

360
00:23:57,729 --> 00:24:01,233
- You don't think a white girl
made that shit up.
- I... l...

361
00:24:01,358 --> 00:24:03,485
- Our free cheer service
is over as of this moment.
- Over!

362
00:24:03,610 --> 00:24:06,822
- Finito!
Everytime we getsome, herey'all come,

363
00:24:06,905 --> 00:24:09,783
tryin' to steal it,
puttin' blond hair on it and
calling it something different.

364
00:24:09,867 --> 00:24:11,785
We've had the best squad
around for years,

365
00:24:11,869 --> 00:24:13,787
but no one's been able
to see what we can do.

366
00:24:13,871 --> 00:24:15,914
But you better believe
all that's gonna change
this year.

367
00:24:16,039 --> 00:24:19,168
I'm captain, and I guarantee you
we'll make it to nationals.

368
00:24:19,293 --> 00:24:22,421
Hand over the tape
you made tonight and we'll
call it even for now.

369
00:24:22,546 --> 00:24:25,340
We don't have any tape.
Really. We just came
to see the show.

370
00:24:25,465 --> 00:24:28,510
What? Come on, Isis.
Let me do this.

371
00:24:28,635 --> 00:24:33,015
You know what? Let's go.

372
00:24:33,098 --> 00:24:36,852
Wait a minute. So that's it?
We're just gonna let them go?

373
00:24:36,935 --> 00:24:41,481
Yeah, because unlike them,
we have class.

374
00:24:41,565 --> 00:24:41,732
I swear I had no idea.

375
00:24:41,732 --> 00:24:44,234
I swear I had no idea.

376
00:24:44,359 --> 00:24:46,320
Well, now you do.

377
00:24:49,156 --> 00:24:53,118
Hmmph. You been touched
by an angel, girl.

378
00:24:53,202 --> 00:24:55,120
Jenelope, let'sgo.

379
00:25:01,001 --> 00:25:03,837
We just so almost
got our asses kicked
back there!

380
00:25:03,921 --> 00:25:05,839
I mean, I knew I'd seen
those routines before.

381
00:25:05,923 --> 00:25:08,550
We used to play
East Compton
all the time.

382
00:25:11,136 --> 00:25:13,263
You really had no idea,
did you?

383
00:25:13,347 --> 00:25:16,183
Do you know
what this means?

384
00:25:16,308 --> 00:25:19,061
My entire
cheer leading career
has been a lie.

385
00:25:19,186 --> 00:25:22,981
Well, look on the bright side.
It's only cheerleading.

386
00:25:23,065 --> 00:25:25,359
I am only cheerleading.

387
00:25:29,071 --> 00:25:32,783
- Do you believe in curses?
- What are you talking about?

388
00:25:32,866 --> 00:25:35,369
I think I知 cursed.

389
00:25:35,452 --> 00:25:38,080
And why is that?

390
00:25:38,205 --> 00:25:41,291
This past summer
at Cheer Camp,

391
00:25:41,416 --> 00:25:44,086
all the new seniors
had to do a dare.

392
00:25:44,211 --> 00:25:47,256
See, there's this thing
called the Spirit Stick,

393
00:25:47,381 --> 00:25:49,466
and it can never,
ever touch the ground.

394
00:25:49,550 --> 00:25:53,303
Torrance Shipman,
your mission, should you
choose to accept it...

395
00:25:53,387 --> 00:25:55,305
and you better...

396
00:25:55,389 --> 00:25:57,432
is to capture
the Spirit Stick...

397
00:25:57,516 --> 00:26:01,854
and drop it in front
of the entire camp.

398
00:26:01,979 --> 00:26:04,690
Do you wanna go my way

399
00:26:12,948 --> 00:26:15,492
Do you wanna go my way

400
00:26:15,617 --> 00:26:20,330
The future is clear
Let's get intogear

401
00:26:20,455 --> 00:26:22,833
Y'all are such
an inspiration to us.

402
00:26:22,958 --> 00:26:27,588
Well, I just wanted
to congratulate you guys
and take a picture of you...

403
00:26:30,799 --> 00:26:32,718
with the Spirit Stick.

404
00:26:34,803 --> 00:26:37,556
Here.

405
00:26:50,277 --> 00:26:53,739
Do you wanna go my way

406
00:26:55,324 --> 00:26:57,993
Do you wanna go my way
Here.

407
00:26:58,118 --> 00:27:01,246
- I don't want it now.
- No, it's okay.

408
00:27:01,371 --> 00:27:03,248
The Spirit Stick
doesn't lose anything.

409
00:27:03,373 --> 00:27:06,168
The person who drops it,
however,

410
00:27:06,251 --> 00:27:08,212
goes to Hades!

411
00:27:12,466 --> 00:27:15,427
I don't mean to laugh,
but cheerleading
urban legends?

412
00:27:17,304 --> 00:27:20,933
You're not jinxed.
Shit happens.

413
00:27:28,857 --> 00:27:30,734
I have to tell you
something.
I'm on the phone, creep.

414
00:27:30,859 --> 00:27:34,071
I realize that,
and normally I'd be
listening on the other line,

415
00:27:34,196 --> 00:27:35,989
but this is important.
Okay, what?

416
00:27:36,114 --> 00:27:38,158
Ohh! Get out!

417
00:27:38,242 --> 00:27:40,160
Thank you for listening.

418
00:27:42,913 --> 00:27:44,831
Yo. Back later.
Is Aaron around?

419
00:27:44,915 --> 00:27:46,834
Do you know when?
No.

420
00:27:46,917 --> 00:27:49,211
Have him call Torrance.
It's urgent.
All right.

421
00:27:49,294 --> 00:27:51,213
Big Red totally screwed us!

422
00:27:51,296 --> 00:27:53,298
I mean monster screwed us!

423
00:27:53,423 --> 00:27:56,635
I put this to the entire squad.
Swear you guys didn't know.

424
00:27:56,718 --> 00:27:59,805
Big Red didn't exactly
let any of us help with
the routines, Torrance.

425
00:27:59,888 --> 00:28:03,600
- I cannot believe she did this.
- I feel awful. It's depraved.

426
00:28:03,725 --> 00:28:06,228
I mean, those East Compton girls
wanted to grill our asses.

427
00:28:06,353 --> 00:28:11,108
Big Redran the show, man.
We were just flying ignorami,
for sobbing out loud.

428
00:28:11,233 --> 00:28:13,694
We can't go to regionals
with a stolen routine.

429
00:28:13,819 --> 00:28:16,405
It's too risky.
Changing the routine now...

430
00:28:16,488 --> 00:28:19,449
would be total
murder-suicide.
Seriously.

431
00:28:19,575 --> 00:28:22,202
Let's not put
the "duh" in "dumb."

432
00:28:22,286 --> 00:28:24,246
How are East Compton
gonna prove anything?

433
00:28:24,288 --> 00:28:28,125
You people are unbelievable.
I mean, we're talking about
cheating here.

434
00:28:28,208 --> 00:28:30,961
Sorry, new girl,
but nobody hit your buzzer.

435
00:28:31,086 --> 00:28:35,507
Look, I hate to be predictable,
but I don't give a shit.

436
00:28:35,591 --> 00:28:39,761
We learned that routine
fair and square.
We logged the man-hours.

437
00:28:39,887 --> 00:28:43,891
Don't punish the squad
for Big Red's mistake.

438
00:28:43,974 --> 00:28:46,518
This isn't about cheating.

439
00:28:46,643 --> 00:28:50,981
This is about winning.
Everyone in favor of winning?

440
00:29:00,782 --> 00:29:04,328
I get what you're saying,
Missy, but there's no time.

441
00:29:04,411 --> 00:29:06,663
If we don't do the routine,
we've got nothing else.

442
00:29:06,788 --> 00:29:09,750
So, you in?

443
00:29:14,963 --> 00:29:17,007
Whatever.

444
00:29:24,681 --> 00:29:26,600
Get out of here!

445
00:29:26,683 --> 00:29:29,645
Hey, this is
the living room.
It's public domain.

446
00:29:31,396 --> 00:29:34,650
Yo.
Hey, may I please speak
to Aaron? It's Torrance.

447
00:29:34,775 --> 00:29:37,819
He's not here. He's, uh...
He's not here. Bye.

448
00:29:41,657 --> 00:29:44,576
I'll take "Famous Losers"
for 200, Alex.
Shut up, moron!

449
00:29:44,660 --> 00:29:48,664
It's not my fault you're in love
with a big gay cheerleader who
won't return your phone calls.

450
00:29:48,747 --> 00:29:52,709
- Aaron is not gay.
- Oh, so someone just made him
become a cheerleader?

451
00:29:52,793 --> 00:29:54,795
He's just... busy!

452
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:56,922
Yeah, busy
scamming on guys.

453
00:29:57,798 --> 00:30:00,217
Give me that!

454
00:30:01,260 --> 00:30:03,178
Bitch!

455
00:30:08,976 --> 00:30:10,644
Where is she?

456
00:30:10,769 --> 00:30:13,480
Come on.

457
00:30:16,275 --> 00:30:18,819
Oh, baby!
Ohh! Whoo!

458
00:30:18,944 --> 00:30:21,071
No way.

459
00:30:21,154 --> 00:30:23,490
Sexy mama!

460
00:30:23,574 --> 00:30:27,327
Whoo! Take it off!

461
00:30:30,372 --> 00:30:33,166
Come on. Go, sexy.

462
00:30:33,250 --> 00:30:35,169
Whoo!

463
00:30:35,252 --> 00:30:37,421
You're on fire, yeah!

464
00:30:39,089 --> 00:30:41,633
- You sure I can stay over
your house tonight?
- Totally fine.

465
00:30:41,717 --> 00:30:45,220
My parents are at some benefit.
They'll be pouring themselves
into bed around dawn.

466
00:30:45,345 --> 00:30:49,474
Good. We gotta start early.
You'll be a star
cheerleader yet.

467
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:52,936
All the cheerleaders
in the world wouldn't
help our football team.

468
00:30:53,020 --> 00:30:56,440
Man, it's just wrong.
Cheering for them
is just plain mean.

469
00:30:56,565 --> 00:30:58,442
Everybody comes
to see you ladies,
anyway.

470
00:30:58,567 --> 00:31:01,570
Because we're
such fine athletes.
Oh, live with it.

471
00:31:01,695 --> 00:31:05,115
You'll be fighting off
major oglers while we
defend our sexuality.

472
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:07,618
What is your sexuality?

473
00:31:07,701 --> 00:31:12,289
Jan's straight,
while I知...
controversial.

474
00:31:12,414 --> 00:31:15,584
Are you trying to tell me
you speak fag?
Oh, fluently.

475
00:31:15,667 --> 00:31:17,878
And Courtney and Whitney...
"dyke-adelic"?
No!

476
00:31:18,003 --> 00:31:20,297
Are you kidding?
I don't think so.

477
00:31:20,422 --> 00:31:22,549
Courtney doesn't
wear anything
under her spankies.

478
00:31:22,674 --> 00:31:24,551
That's
no excuse,Jan.

479
00:31:24,676 --> 00:31:26,595
I can't help it
if my digits slip
occasionally.

480
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:29,473
Nuh-uh. Slip?
Where?

481
00:31:29,556 --> 00:31:31,725
Come on, Missy.
Don't make him say it.

482
00:31:31,850 --> 00:31:34,061
Oh, my God.
My God too.

483
00:31:34,186 --> 00:31:36,438
You're
a sick man,Jan.

484
00:31:36,563 --> 00:31:38,857
Now, ladies and gentlemen,

485
00:31:38,982 --> 00:31:42,402
put your hands together
for the Rancho Carne Toros!

486
00:31:51,328 --> 00:31:53,705
And now let's hear it...

487
00:31:53,789 --> 00:31:57,668
for the five-time national
cheerleading champions,

488
00:31:57,751 --> 00:32:00,420
the mighty Toros!

489
00:32:13,559 --> 00:32:16,270
Go! Go! Come on!

490
00:32:18,939 --> 00:32:22,192
We're number one!
Come on! Let's hear it!

491
00:32:22,276 --> 00:32:24,444
Whoo! Yeah!

492
00:32:26,321 --> 00:32:30,033
Bring it on, baby!
Come on!
Let's hear it!

493
00:32:32,661 --> 00:32:34,746
Go, Toros!

494
00:32:37,833 --> 00:32:40,586
Come on, Toros! Whoo!

495
00:32:40,711 --> 00:32:43,422
Go, Toros!

496
00:32:43,547 --> 00:32:46,008
Come on, Toros!

497
00:32:47,634 --> 00:32:49,803
Come on. Yeah!

498
00:32:49,928 --> 00:32:52,222
Yeah, Toros! Yeah!

499
00:32:58,437 --> 00:33:02,941
Go, Toros!
Yo-ho, go, everybody!

500
00:33:03,066 --> 00:33:05,110
Why don't you let
your cheerleaders
play for you?

501
00:33:05,194 --> 00:33:07,613
At least they win shit
occasionally.
Is that the best you got?

502
00:33:07,738 --> 00:33:10,574
Bring it on, butt plug.
You want more? Okay.

503
00:33:10,699 --> 00:33:12,701
While we're out here
kicking your ass,

504
00:33:12,826 --> 00:33:16,455
your cheer boys
are over there scamming
on all your squirrel.

505
00:33:16,580 --> 00:33:19,416
Which is cool, since you
don't have dicks anyway.

506
00:33:19,499 --> 00:33:21,835
 Bitch!

507
00:33:21,919 --> 00:33:23,837
- Punk!

508
00:33:39,102 --> 00:33:41,980
Hey, Toros
That's right

509
00:33:42,064 --> 00:33:44,358
The red, black and white

510
00:33:44,399 --> 00:33:46,485
Guess what, guess what

511
00:33:46,610 --> 00:33:49,238
You really suck

512
00:33:53,075 --> 00:33:56,203
Hey, that's all right
That's okay

513
00:33:56,328 --> 00:33:58,580
You're gonna
pump our gas someday

514
00:33:58,705 --> 00:34:01,291
That's allright
That's okay

515
00:34:01,416 --> 00:34:03,877
You're gonna pump
our gas someday

516
00:34:07,464 --> 00:34:11,426
Come on, guys!
Touchdown! Let's go!

517
00:34:18,684 --> 00:34:21,562
- Nice.

518
00:34:27,442 --> 00:34:29,403
- Fourteen-nothing.
- Go!

519
00:34:29,528 --> 00:34:31,822
Hut!

520
00:34:37,452 --> 00:34:40,873
And with 4.:50left
in the third quarter,
Losers.

521
00:34:40,956 --> 00:34:43,250
it's Costa Mesa 34,
Torosnothing.

522
00:34:43,333 --> 00:34:45,252
Come on, Defense, work!

523
00:34:45,335 --> 00:34:48,088
- Work!
- Knock 'em down,
roll 'em around.

524
00:34:48,172 --> 00:34:50,799
- Come on, Defense, work!
- Work!

525
00:34:50,883 --> 00:34:53,886
Knock 'em down,
roll 'em around.
Come on, Defense, work!

526
00:34:54,011 --> 00:34:56,805
Work!
Knock 'em down,
roll 'em around.

527
00:34:56,930 --> 00:34:59,141
- Come on, Defense, work!
- Work!

528
00:34:59,224 --> 00:35:01,852
Knock 'em down,
roll 'em around.

529
00:35:01,977 --> 00:35:03,645
Come on, Defense, work!
Work!

530
00:35:03,770 --> 00:35:07,774
Knock 'em down,
roll 'em around.
Come on, Defense, work!

531
00:35:07,900 --> 00:35:09,985
Ohh!

532
00:35:12,988 --> 00:35:15,282
Jan!

533
00:35:18,243 --> 00:35:20,120
Go, Toros!

534
00:35:20,204 --> 00:35:22,039
Come on! Yeah!

535
00:35:23,957 --> 00:35:25,959
Come on, Toros!

536
00:35:27,252 --> 00:35:29,171
You're, like,
totally his eye candy.

537
00:35:29,254 --> 00:35:31,298
God, I can't believe
you'd do that to Aaron.

538
00:35:31,381 --> 00:35:34,134
Do what?
Especially with him.

539
00:35:34,218 --> 00:35:36,178
What are you
talking about?

540
00:35:36,261 --> 00:35:38,514
Don't play dumb.
We're better at it than you.

541
00:35:38,639 --> 00:35:40,891
You're having
cheer sex with him.

542
00:35:41,016 --> 00:35:45,437
Flag on
the play, called against...
you guessed it... the Toros.

543
00:35:45,521 --> 00:35:47,439
Remember, our next defeat
is scheduled...

544
00:35:47,523 --> 00:35:50,734
for next Friday night at 8:00.
Let'sgo, Toros!

545
00:35:50,859 --> 00:35:53,695
Let's go, Toros!

546
00:35:53,779 --> 00:35:57,157
Let's go, Toros!

547
00:35:57,282 --> 00:35:59,910
Let's go, Toros!

548
00:35:59,993 --> 00:36:02,246
Let's go, Toros!

549
00:36:02,329 --> 00:36:04,540
Allright!

550
00:36:04,623 --> 00:36:08,126
We're sweet
We got the whip
We can't be beat

551
00:36:08,210 --> 00:36:10,128
We're the best
Our team's too cool

552
00:36:10,212 --> 00:36:12,631
We got the class to rock
this school, ah, yeah

553
00:36:12,714 --> 00:36:16,552
We bad, we got the team
We can't be had

554
00:36:16,677 --> 00:36:18,428
We're the best
So score them points

555
00:36:18,512 --> 00:36:20,264
You win the game
We'll rock this joint

556
00:36:20,389 --> 00:36:23,642
Go, Toros, go, Toros
Go, go, go, Toros

557
00:36:23,725 --> 00:36:27,479
Go, Clovers, go, Clovers
Go, go, go, Clovers

558
00:36:27,563 --> 00:36:29,940
Our game is fierce
and we are hip

559
00:36:30,065 --> 00:36:31,942
So get on back
You can't touch this

560
00:36:32,067 --> 00:36:33,986
Our game is bad
We're without peer

561
00:36:34,069 --> 00:36:36,029
So get that weakness
outta here

562
00:36:36,154 --> 00:36:38,240
Tried to steal our bit
but you look like shit

563
00:36:38,365 --> 00:36:41,243
But we're the ones
who are down with it

564
00:36:46,039 --> 00:36:51,295
- I still say we use
the routine we have.

565
00:36:51,420 --> 00:36:54,631
- If we have to
start over, I quit.

566
00:36:54,715 --> 00:36:56,925
And that's the game.

567
00:36:57,050 --> 00:36:59,678
Whoever here is
for a new routine,
raise your hand.

568
00:36:59,761 --> 00:37:04,683
Finalscore.: Cougars 42,
Torosnothing.

569
00:37:04,766 --> 00:37:07,144
Jan's got spirit.
Yes, he do.

570
00:37:07,227 --> 00:37:10,898
Jan's got spirit.
How 'bout you?

571
00:37:10,981 --> 00:37:13,108
Dude, you just lost.

572
00:37:19,489 --> 00:37:22,576
So is every game
that eventful?
No, thank God.

573
00:37:22,659 --> 00:37:24,620
We have a real situation
on our hands.

574
00:37:24,703 --> 00:37:26,747
I mean,
we were humiliated
on our own turf.

575
00:37:26,872 --> 00:37:29,416
We might have
to have a rumble.

576
00:37:29,499 --> 00:37:33,504
This is a serious problem!
Oh, so is your breath.

577
00:37:33,629 --> 00:37:36,298
Oh, my God.
Yeah.

578
00:38:27,891 --> 00:38:30,435
- What are you doing?
- Um...

579
00:38:36,733 --> 00:38:38,694
Where's the bathroom?

580
00:38:38,777 --> 00:38:42,573
- Right there.
- Oh.

581
00:40:06,615 --> 00:40:09,076
Good night.
Night.

582
00:40:13,747 --> 00:40:15,666
Are you into my brother?

583
00:40:15,749 --> 00:40:17,709
No.
I have a boyfriend.

584
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:49,116
Hello.
Tor, is that you?
Aaron?

585
00:40:49,199 --> 00:40:51,159
Where have you been?
I keep trying to call you.

586
00:40:51,243 --> 00:40:54,788
Yeah, I know. I've been, like,
totally busy with school
and practice and stuff.

587
00:40:54,913 --> 00:40:57,040
What's up?
Oh, it's bad, Aaron.

588
00:40:57,165 --> 00:40:59,835
Miss Red snaked
our routines from
the East Compton Clovers.

589
00:40:59,918 --> 00:41:02,462
- All of our routines.
- What?

590
00:41:02,588 --> 00:41:05,674
They found out.
They showed up at the game.
Gauntlets were thrown.

591
00:41:05,757 --> 00:41:08,760
Tell me you didn't know
about this. I don't know
what to do here.

592
00:41:08,886 --> 00:41:12,347
Of course I didn't know,
but you gotta calm down.

593
00:41:12,472 --> 00:41:16,727
This is not that big a deal.
Everybody uses
everybody else's material.

594
00:41:16,852 --> 00:41:19,563
- It's like this unwritten rule
or something.
- That doesn 't help me.

595
00:41:19,688 --> 00:41:23,442
We can't do their routine
at regionals because they're
gonna do their routine.

596
00:41:23,525 --> 00:41:25,777
Come on, Tor,
you need a new routine.

597
00:41:25,903 --> 00:41:27,779
That's all. No problem.

598
00:41:27,905 --> 00:41:30,407
Just hire a professional
choreographer.
A choreographer?

599
00:41:30,532 --> 00:41:32,576
Look, just think of it
as collaboration.

600
00:41:32,701 --> 00:41:34,995
The U.C.A. totally looks
the other way.

601
00:41:35,078 --> 00:41:38,999
Call this guy.
His name is Sparky Polastri.

602
00:41:39,124 --> 00:41:41,043
Pen.
Remember nationals last year?

603
00:41:41,168 --> 00:41:43,921
Knows his shit, all right?
Here's the number.

604
00:41:44,046 --> 00:41:48,008
It's 555-7219.
Thanks, Aaron.

605
00:41:48,091 --> 00:41:51,303
You always know
what to do.
Mm-hmm. Bye, baby.

606
00:41:53,347 --> 00:41:55,349
Who was that?

607
00:41:55,474 --> 00:41:57,851
My sister. Mmm.

608
00:41:57,935 --> 00:42:01,355
But you're not
my sister, are you?

609
00:42:01,438 --> 00:42:04,691
- He says we should hire
a choreographer.

610
00:42:04,775 --> 00:42:06,985
Hello.

611
00:42:07,069 --> 00:42:09,446
Hi. May I please speak
to Sparky Polastri?

612
00:42:09,571 --> 00:42:12,115
He'll need three or four days
to teach us the routine.

613
00:42:12,241 --> 00:42:16,078
But here's the thing.
It's gonna cost us
$2,000.

614
00:42:16,161 --> 00:42:19,206
What, do I have
the letters A-T-M
tattooed on my forehead?

615
00:42:19,331 --> 00:42:21,917
We were thinking more
like D-A-D-D-Y.

616
00:42:23,877 --> 00:42:25,754
Maybe I can get 500.

617
00:42:25,879 --> 00:42:29,341
Okay, then we only need 1,500
more by Monday.

618
00:42:29,424 --> 00:42:29,591
What's up, Whitney?
Hi.

619
00:42:29,591 --> 00:42:32,302
What's up, Whitney?
Hi.

620
00:42:32,386 --> 00:42:34,471
Here we are at
the Rancho Carne
Toro car wash,

621
00:42:34,596 --> 00:42:36,431
raising a little money.

622
00:42:38,559 --> 00:42:41,770
Yeah, baby, yeah!

623
00:42:41,854 --> 00:42:43,897
Work it, Kasey!

624
00:42:44,022 --> 00:42:46,650
- What's up, Les?
- Come to Mama.

625
00:42:46,775 --> 00:42:48,777
Soak it up.

626
00:42:48,861 --> 00:42:52,406
- Workin 'hard for our money?
- That's a good shot, Les.

627
00:42:54,700 --> 00:42:58,120
Give a little buff job.
That's good.
Oh, that's attractive, Tor.

628
00:42:58,203 --> 00:43:01,582
Lookin 'good.
Shakin 'the booty.

629
00:43:04,334 --> 00:43:06,295
Missy, what the hell
are you doing?

630
00:43:11,341 --> 00:43:13,594
Watch it! Aww!

631
00:43:13,719 --> 00:43:15,637
Dude, don't turn
that camera off!

632
00:43:29,359 --> 00:43:31,278
- Hey, perv.

633
00:43:31,361 --> 00:43:34,323
Hand over your 15 bucks
or get out of here.

634
00:43:34,406 --> 00:43:38,577
- What are you doing?
- Making money from guys
ogling my goodies.

635
00:43:38,702 --> 00:43:41,788
Aw, I didn't need to hear that.
That was an over-share.

636
00:43:41,914 --> 00:43:44,583
Hey, Torrance.
Come here a sec.

637
00:43:46,251 --> 00:43:48,170
We'll just
get this over with.

638
00:43:49,838 --> 00:43:52,508
My brother wants
to check out your rack.

639
00:43:54,384 --> 00:43:57,930
You know,
I begged my mom
for a brother.

640
00:43:58,013 --> 00:44:00,349
He'd look a little ridiculous
in that bikini, wouldn't he?

641
00:44:00,474 --> 00:44:04,770
- Yeah.
- So, nice car.

642
00:44:04,853 --> 00:44:07,481
Yeah. Um...

643
00:44:07,564 --> 00:44:09,483
What can I say?
I drive hard.

644
00:44:09,566 --> 00:44:13,779
- Shouldn't take long to wash.
- Don't even worry about it.
I got all afternoon.

645
00:44:13,904 --> 00:44:15,781
I'll bet you do.

646
00:44:18,575 --> 00:44:20,494
Where the hell
is this guy?

647
00:44:20,619 --> 00:44:22,621
Listen, we're lucky
he's even doing this for us.

648
00:44:44,351 --> 00:44:48,564
Prepare for total domination!

649
00:44:48,689 --> 00:44:50,774
Domination, domination.

650
00:44:52,901 --> 00:44:54,903
Y'allready for this

651
00:45:12,045 --> 00:45:14,047
Great.

652
00:45:17,342 --> 00:45:19,553
Thanks for coming.
We're...
Don't speak.

653
00:45:25,142 --> 00:45:27,394
You. You have weak ankles.

654
00:45:29,813 --> 00:45:31,690
One of your calves
is bigger than the other.

655
00:45:33,358 --> 00:45:35,194
Too much makeup.

656
00:45:35,277 --> 00:45:38,071
Not enough makeup.
What's with the skin?

657
00:45:38,197 --> 00:45:40,866
Say it with me: "Sunlight"!

658
00:45:43,118 --> 00:45:46,371
Male cheerleaders.
Enough said.

659
00:45:46,496 --> 00:45:49,082
Smile.

660
00:45:49,166 --> 00:45:52,961
- Don't smile.
- Chicken.

661
00:45:53,045 --> 00:45:55,130
Good general tone
and musculature.

662
00:45:59,510 --> 00:46:01,762
Report those compliments
to your ass before
it gets so big...

663
00:46:01,845 --> 00:46:03,764
it forms its own web site.

664
00:46:07,267 --> 00:46:10,604
And you, I take you
to be the captain,

665
00:46:10,687 --> 00:46:12,773
which means
you'll probably need
more work than anyone.

666
00:46:12,898 --> 00:46:14,983
Look, you don't...
But...
Shh!

667
00:46:15,067 --> 00:46:19,029
No, no, no.
Don't speak. Don't think.

668
00:46:19,154 --> 00:46:22,282
Listen and learn.

669
00:46:27,663 --> 00:46:30,040
I'm a choreographer.

670
00:46:30,165 --> 00:46:32,459
That's what I do.

671
00:46:32,584 --> 00:46:35,546
You... are cheerleaders.

672
00:46:35,629 --> 00:46:38,340
Cheerleaders are dancers
who have gone retarded.

673
00:46:38,465 --> 00:46:43,428
What you do is a tiny,
pathetic subset of dancing.

674
00:46:43,554 --> 00:46:47,015
I will attempt to transform
your robotic routines into poetry...

675
00:46:47,140 --> 00:46:49,017
written with the human body.

676
00:46:49,142 --> 00:46:52,896
Follow me or perish,
sweater monkeys.

677
00:46:54,690 --> 00:46:56,733
I want you to think
of what you ate today.

678
00:46:56,859 --> 00:46:58,777
Got it? Now cut that in half.

679
00:46:58,902 --> 00:47:02,364
This is called a diet.
Everyone start one today.

680
00:47:02,489 --> 00:47:05,284
Darcy, honey,
you should stop eating.

681
00:47:05,409 --> 00:47:09,246
You see, when you
skip a meal, your body
feeds off its fat stores.

682
00:47:09,329 --> 00:47:12,666
And if you skip enough,
maybe your body
will eat your ass.

683
00:47:14,126 --> 00:47:16,837
Why does everyone
have to go on a diet?

684
00:47:16,962 --> 00:47:19,840
Because in cheerleading,
we throw people in the air,

685
00:47:19,923 --> 00:47:22,092
and fat people don't go as high.

686
00:47:22,217 --> 00:47:24,553
- Come on, come on.
Let's get back to work!

687
00:47:24,678 --> 00:47:26,555
Ah!

688
00:47:36,607 --> 00:47:39,568
I want dangerous!
I wanna feel like somebody's
gonna snap their neck!

689
00:47:39,651 --> 00:47:42,446
Spirit fingers!
Give me spirit fingers!

690
00:47:42,571 --> 00:47:45,282
Spirit fingers.
Give me spirit!

691
00:47:49,286 --> 00:47:52,414
Ouch!
What? I told you
l'd catch you.

692
00:47:52,539 --> 00:47:55,959
Look, I understand
you have underwear
up your ass right now,

693
00:47:56,084 --> 00:47:58,045
but it beats the hell
out of a shattered skull.

694
00:47:58,128 --> 00:48:00,672
Think about it.

695
00:48:13,101 --> 00:48:15,562
Okay, now,
spirit fingers.
Spirit fingers!

696
00:48:17,231 --> 00:48:19,316
And spirit fingers!

697
00:48:25,364 --> 00:48:28,867
- Oh, my God!
- These are not
spirit fingers.

698
00:48:31,787 --> 00:48:34,748
These are spirit fingers.

699
00:48:34,873 --> 00:48:37,751
And these... are gold.

700
00:48:37,835 --> 00:48:41,630
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

701
00:48:41,755 --> 00:48:45,592
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

702
00:48:45,676 --> 00:48:48,637
Screw this.
I did not sign on
for spirit fingers.

703
00:48:50,055 --> 00:48:53,308
Come on!
The spirit fingers are great!

704
00:48:53,433 --> 00:48:55,310
Yeah, whatever.

705
00:48:55,435 --> 00:48:57,396
We are so screwed.

706
00:49:05,654 --> 00:49:08,574
- Hey. What's the matter?
- Hey.

707
00:49:08,699 --> 00:49:10,659
You don't wanna know.

708
00:49:10,742 --> 00:49:14,872
Ah. Cheer crisis.

709
00:49:16,582 --> 00:49:19,918
I've just gotten
so bogged down
in all this... crap.

710
00:49:20,002 --> 00:49:23,964
Well, if it's crap,
why do you do it?

711
00:49:25,799 --> 00:49:28,468
I don't know.
So quit.

712
00:49:28,594 --> 00:49:31,305
Maybe I should.
Yeah, I mean, if you
don't like it anymore.

713
00:49:31,430 --> 00:49:34,433
I didn't say that.
Sounds like it.

714
00:49:35,684 --> 00:49:37,603
I don't know what I want.

715
00:49:37,686 --> 00:49:40,647
I remember back
when I cheered at
my school in Detroit.

716
00:49:40,731 --> 00:49:42,733
You cheered
at your other high school?

717
00:49:42,858 --> 00:49:46,195
No, I never cheered,
but I know what
you're going through.

718
00:49:46,320 --> 00:49:51,241
And regardless
of all the politics
and the doubts...

719
00:49:51,325 --> 00:49:53,619
and the crap,

720
00:49:53,744 --> 00:49:56,413
you just have to know
that you can do it.

721
00:49:59,875 --> 00:50:01,793
And if it helps,

722
00:50:01,877 --> 00:50:04,171
I know you can.

723
00:50:04,254 --> 00:50:06,715
You do?

724
00:50:06,840 --> 00:50:08,842
Yeah.

725
00:50:12,679 --> 00:50:15,057
Allright, allright!
I'm ready to make
a fool of myself.

726
00:50:16,767 --> 00:50:18,894
State regionals,
here we come.

727
00:50:46,088 --> 00:50:48,841
Welcome to the world
of competitive cheerleading.

728
00:50:59,059 --> 00:51:02,020
High school divisions,
please check the signs.
If you're not here...

729
00:51:04,898 --> 00:51:09,111
Hallowed be Thy name.
Thy kingdom come,
Thy will be done...

730
00:51:17,244 --> 00:51:19,204
Broncos!

731
00:51:19,329 --> 00:51:21,874
Ready? Okay!

732
00:51:41,768 --> 00:51:43,687
Some of these uniforms
look so skanky.

733
00:51:43,812 --> 00:51:46,523
Whatever.
They're white trash.
Where do they get them?

734
00:51:49,109 --> 00:51:52,446
Cutter, I知 gonna
kick your ass,
you evil whore!

735
00:51:52,529 --> 00:51:54,698
Get over it, hag!

736
00:51:54,781 --> 00:51:58,368
Oww! She did not
just hit me!
She's a little kid.

737
00:51:58,493 --> 00:52:02,122
You little...
Get off me!

738
00:52:02,206 --> 00:52:04,499
Leave me alone!
Stop it, Courtney!

739
00:52:14,635 --> 00:52:16,512
Hi. You, yes.

740
00:52:16,637 --> 00:52:18,514
Your head was down.

741
00:52:18,639 --> 00:52:21,058
Your head was down
during that move.

742
00:52:21,141 --> 00:52:23,060
How are you gonna
give a proper score...

743
00:52:23,143 --> 00:52:25,729
if your head is down
during a move?

744
00:52:30,359 --> 00:52:34,613
Remember, they give
extra points for alacrity
and effulgence.

745
00:52:34,696 --> 00:52:36,949
Did we bring those?

746
00:52:37,074 --> 00:52:38,992
Oh, no.
Look who's here.

747
00:52:48,043 --> 00:52:50,462
Hi.

748
00:52:58,053 --> 00:52:59,930
We're in trouble.

749
00:53:00,055 --> 00:53:03,517
And now,
making their first appearance
at the U.C.A. California regionals,

750
00:53:03,642 --> 00:53:06,645
the East Compton Clovers!

751
00:53:08,230 --> 00:53:11,608
- Yeah, Clovers!

752
00:54:15,881 --> 00:54:19,134
I'm standing here
with five-time national
returning champions,

753
00:54:19,218 --> 00:54:23,639
the Rancho Carne Toros.

754
00:54:23,764 --> 00:54:26,016
Leading the squad this year
is senior Torrance Shipman.

755
00:54:26,099 --> 00:54:29,019
Torrance, one of the things
we've come to expect...

756
00:54:29,102 --> 00:54:32,481
from the Toros over
the last few years is
a highly original routine.

757
00:54:32,606 --> 00:54:34,608
Can we expect
the same this year?
Well,

758
00:54:34,733 --> 00:54:36,860
I think everyone
goes out there
the same way,

759
00:54:36,985 --> 00:54:40,280
being as prepared
as they can be and
just hoping for the best.

760
00:54:40,405 --> 00:54:42,324
We're just glad
to be back here...

761
00:54:42,449 --> 00:54:45,160
and eager to see
what other squads
have come up with.

762
00:54:45,285 --> 00:54:48,163
Prepare for total domination!

763
00:54:48,288 --> 00:54:50,541
Domination! Domination!
Isn't that Sparky?

764
00:54:50,666 --> 00:54:53,210
Thank you,
Rancho Carne Toros,
and good luck.

765
00:54:53,335 --> 00:54:55,295
And now,
the Mighty Muskrats...
Thanks.

766
00:54:55,420 --> 00:54:57,965
of Mesa Cucamonga!

767
00:55:03,178 --> 00:55:07,015
- Spirit fingers.
- They stole our routine!

768
00:55:12,062 --> 00:55:14,147
Y'allready for this

769
00:55:37,379 --> 00:55:40,048
Keep that
Trojan spirit up!

770
00:55:42,384 --> 00:55:44,303
It's the curse.
What?

771
00:55:44,386 --> 00:55:46,513
The Spirit Stick curse.
Will you
lay off with that?

772
00:55:46,638 --> 00:55:48,765
There's no curse,
and you're not
going to Hades.

773
00:55:48,891 --> 00:55:51,268
News flash!
Look around.
We are in Hades!

774
00:55:51,351 --> 00:55:53,770
Rancho Carne!
You're up next!

775
00:55:55,355 --> 00:55:57,608
And now,
from San Diego, California,

776
00:55:57,733 --> 00:56:01,195
the five-time
national champions,

777
00:56:01,320 --> 00:56:04,990
the Rancho Carne Toros!

778
00:56:05,115 --> 00:56:08,744
Yeah! Yeah!

779
00:56:08,869 --> 00:56:11,163
I bet this is good.

780
00:56:13,457 --> 00:56:17,336
Prepare for total domination!

781
00:56:17,461 --> 00:56:20,756
Domination!
Domination! Domination!

782
00:56:25,093 --> 00:56:27,304
Didn't we just
see this routine?

783
00:56:36,438 --> 00:56:38,357
Y'allready for this

784
00:57:37,124 --> 00:57:40,919
- What the f...

785
00:57:50,512 --> 00:57:54,183
The Rancho Carne Toros,
ladies and gentlemen.

786
00:57:54,308 --> 00:57:56,351
Go, Toros!

787
00:57:56,476 --> 00:57:59,062
Did they screw up.

788
00:57:59,146 --> 00:58:02,482
That was, um,
interesting.

789
00:58:02,566 --> 00:58:05,110
Nice job!
Y'all should've just stuck
with our routines.

790
00:58:05,194 --> 00:58:07,196
- Yeah.

791
00:58:07,279 --> 00:58:10,115
- Don't worry. We'll send you
a postcard from nationals.
- Six, seven, eight.

792
00:58:10,199 --> 00:58:13,076
Next up, the Fighting Beavers
of San Bernardino.

793
00:58:13,202 --> 00:58:15,078
Torrance Shipman?
Yes.

794
00:58:15,204 --> 00:58:19,249
Tad Freeman, Universal Cheer
Association. We have a problem.
A problem?

795
00:58:19,374 --> 00:58:22,211
Oh, yes,
a very big problem.
Hey.

796
00:58:22,294 --> 00:58:24,296
I don't know
if you can imagine...
Hey.

797
00:58:24,421 --> 00:58:28,050
the incredible sense of deja vu
lexperiencedas I was watching
that last routine.

798
00:58:28,133 --> 00:58:31,678
It tends to make me
suspicious...
I wouldn't just now.

799
00:58:31,762 --> 00:58:33,680
What?
Official cheer business.

800
00:58:33,764 --> 00:58:36,642
Come on. It's me.
Hey, Torrance!

801
00:58:36,767 --> 00:58:39,978
You see, I...

802
00:58:40,103 --> 00:58:43,232
That was smooth.
Real smooth.

803
00:58:43,357 --> 00:58:45,400
I'll see her later.
All righty.

804
00:58:48,779 --> 00:58:53,158
Oh, uh, by the way,
nice spirit fingers.
Yeah.

805
00:58:53,283 --> 00:58:55,244
Well, here's another.

806
00:58:57,037 --> 00:58:58,997
Thanks.

807
00:58:59,081 --> 00:59:02,751
Obviously your Toros
aren't the only squad with
this particular routine.

808
00:59:02,876 --> 00:59:07,673
Does the name
Sparky Polastri
mean anything to you?

809
00:59:07,756 --> 00:59:09,758
Sparky Polastri?
Mm-hmm.

810
00:59:09,883 --> 00:59:13,512
Apparently he's been peddling
this same routine up and down
the California coast.

811
00:59:13,637 --> 00:59:15,681
Six squads total.

812
00:59:15,806 --> 00:59:19,184
We're holding
an emergency session
of the discretionary panel.

813
00:59:19,309 --> 00:59:22,521
About what?
We've never had a situation
like this before.

814
00:59:22,646 --> 00:59:25,524
We really should
disqualify you and...
No, don't punish the squad.

815
00:59:25,649 --> 00:59:27,860
It was my choice
to hire Sparky, not theirs.

816
00:59:27,985 --> 00:59:30,153
Don't penalize everyone
for my bad judgment.

817
00:59:30,279 --> 00:59:32,614
But since there's
no precedent for this,

818
00:59:32,698 --> 00:59:34,658
there's nothing
in the rule books
that forbids it.

819
00:59:34,741 --> 00:59:36,785
It's simply frowned upon,

820
00:59:36,910 --> 00:59:39,496
and I suppose
we can't disqualify you
on those grounds alone.

821
00:59:39,621 --> 00:59:42,207
As defending champions,
you are guaranteed
a bid to Florida,

822
00:59:42,332 --> 00:59:44,209
but know that we'll
be watching you.

823
00:59:44,334 --> 00:59:47,713
And don't expect
to show up at finals
with that routine.

824
00:59:49,464 --> 00:59:51,633
Taking the floor now...

825
00:59:51,758 --> 00:59:54,428
What are you doing?
You're wrecking
everything I built!

826
00:59:54,553 --> 00:59:56,763
It's not totally her fault.
I hooked up...

827
00:59:56,847 --> 00:59:58,807
This season should have
been gravy, okay?

828
00:59:58,932 --> 01:00:01,476
I handpicked the squad,
I delivered
an idiot-proof routine.

829
01:00:01,602 --> 01:00:05,397
- Platter, nationals, hello!
- Don't you mean
a stolen routine?

830
01:00:05,480 --> 01:00:08,233
Oh. Don't be
so naive, Torrance.

831
01:00:08,358 --> 01:00:11,069
Look, the truth is
I was a real leader, okay?

832
01:00:11,195 --> 01:00:13,238
I did what I had to do
to win at nationals,

833
01:00:13,322 --> 01:00:17,534
and ever since I handed
the reins over to you, you've run
my squad into the ground!

834
01:00:17,618 --> 01:00:22,206
If I made any mistake
as a squad leader,
it wasn't borrowing cheers.

835
01:00:22,331 --> 01:00:24,791
It was announcing you
as my successor.

836
01:00:29,338 --> 01:00:31,298
Uh-uh. Not cool.

837
01:00:33,967 --> 01:00:35,969
Hey, Tor. Tor. Wait,
wait, wait, wait, wait.

838
01:00:36,094 --> 01:00:39,264
Let me go. I just
wanna get out of here.
Hey, Big Red's a bitch.

839
01:00:39,389 --> 01:00:41,517
We all know that.
Even she knows that.

840
01:00:41,642 --> 01:00:44,019
I don't know
what to do here, Aaron.

841
01:00:44,061 --> 01:00:48,232
Look. I know I haven't
always been there for you
since I went to college.

842
01:00:48,315 --> 01:00:51,276
It's been
a rough transition,
for both of us.

843
01:00:51,360 --> 01:00:55,030
But I still care about you
as much as I ever did.
You know that, right?

844
01:00:55,155 --> 01:00:56,823
You do?
Of course.

845
01:00:56,949 --> 01:00:59,826
Which is why I hate
to see you like this,
all stressed out.

846
01:00:59,952 --> 01:01:01,912
It's not good for you.

847
01:01:01,995 --> 01:01:05,040
You're a great cheerleader,
Tor, and you're cute as hell.

848
01:01:06,792 --> 01:01:09,795
It's just that maybe...

849
01:01:13,048 --> 01:01:15,092
Maybe...

850
01:01:15,217 --> 01:01:17,219
you're just not
captain material,

851
01:01:17,302 --> 01:01:19,555
and there's nothing
wrong with that.

852
01:01:19,680 --> 01:01:23,183
Maybe you should consider
letting Courtney and Whitney
take over the squad.

853
01:01:23,308 --> 01:01:26,937
They're just like Big Red.
You want me
to give up captain?

854
01:01:27,062 --> 01:01:29,231
Hey, let them deal
with the politics.

855
01:01:29,356 --> 01:01:32,901
You just do
what you do best, Tor.
You cheer.

856
01:01:34,403 --> 01:01:36,488
Cheer, Tor. Okay?

857
01:01:37,865 --> 01:01:40,033
I just wanna see you happy.

858
01:01:54,006 --> 01:01:56,675
Bye.
Mm.

859
01:01:57,843 --> 01:01:59,720
Mmm.

860
01:02:03,765 --> 01:02:05,893
Sleep tight, sweetie.

861
01:02:26,955 --> 01:02:29,458
Friend of yours?

862
01:02:29,583 --> 01:02:31,627
He's my boyfriend.

863
01:02:33,587 --> 01:02:35,881
Look, Cliff,
I can explain.

864
01:02:35,964 --> 01:02:37,883
No. It's cool.

865
01:02:43,347 --> 01:02:46,725
Here, um,
I made you a tape too.

866
01:02:49,520 --> 01:02:52,022
Cliff...

867
01:03:25,764 --> 01:03:28,600
Hey, Torrance, uh,
it's me, Cliff.

868
01:03:28,684 --> 01:03:30,769
Um, here's, uh...

869
01:03:30,894 --> 01:03:34,481
I wrote something, uh,
for you, so here it is.

870
01:03:34,606 --> 01:03:37,234
Oh, Torrance

871
01:03:37,317 --> 01:03:40,487
Can't stand
your cheerleading squad

872
01:03:40,571 --> 01:03:43,991
But I love
your pom-poms

873
01:03:44,074 --> 01:03:48,662
I'd feed you bonbons
all night

874
01:03:48,787 --> 01:03:51,790
One, two, three, four!

875
01:03:55,002 --> 01:03:58,797
Yeah, you got me to feel
all those butterflies inside

876
01:03:58,839 --> 01:04:01,717
In your locker I would hide
The truth

877
01:04:01,842 --> 01:04:04,219
It's only you lsee

878
01:04:04,303 --> 01:04:06,430
And you're just
what I need

879
01:04:06,513 --> 01:04:09,141
I'd bring you flowers
everyday

880
01:04:09,266 --> 01:04:11,894
Just to roll you
in the hay

881
01:04:11,977 --> 01:04:14,438
Well, I知 feelin 'fine
I知 right on time

882
01:04:14,563 --> 01:04:18,275
I know I値l get my way

883
01:04:18,358 --> 01:04:20,819
And you're just
what I need

884
01:04:20,944 --> 01:04:23,238
And you're just
what I need

885
01:04:23,322 --> 01:04:26,158
Not everything
works asit seems

886
01:04:26,200 --> 01:04:29,036
Is that so hard
to believe

887
01:04:29,119 --> 01:04:31,038
'Cause you're just
what I need

888
01:04:31,079 --> 01:04:34,208
And you're just
what I need

889
01:04:34,333 --> 01:04:36,001
Not everything
works asit seems

890
01:04:36,084 --> 01:04:39,087
Is that so hard
to believe

891
01:04:39,213 --> 01:04:40,756
Yeah

892
01:04:47,054 --> 01:04:49,681
Aaron called us
last night.

893
01:04:49,765 --> 01:04:52,559
He told us
you're turning
the squad over to us.

894
01:04:52,643 --> 01:04:55,270
Just because you bit
the big one as captain,

895
01:04:55,395 --> 01:04:57,773
does not mean
we're gonna be
super hard on you.

896
01:04:57,856 --> 01:04:59,775
Oh.
We'll treat you
as ifyou...

897
01:04:59,858 --> 01:05:01,777
didn't screw us
into the ground.

898
01:05:01,860 --> 01:05:04,112
Gee, thanks.
Everyone.

899
01:05:04,238 --> 01:05:06,907
Torrance is not
to be harmed.

900
01:05:07,032 --> 01:05:09,284
We've already decided
on a course of action.

901
01:05:09,409 --> 01:05:11,370
We're gonna for ego
nationals this year.

902
01:05:11,495 --> 01:05:14,164
- Everyone's
already agreed to it.

903
01:05:14,248 --> 01:05:15,832
Uh, except me.
And me!

904
01:05:15,958 --> 01:05:19,253
- Both of you can be replaced.
- I can't believe you guys.

905
01:05:19,336 --> 01:05:23,090
The only person who can
officially resign the post
of captain is the captain,

906
01:05:23,173 --> 01:05:25,217
and I知 not
going anywhere.

907
01:05:25,342 --> 01:05:27,511
Then we'll have
to overthrow you.
Which we will!

908
01:05:27,636 --> 01:05:29,388
Enough!

909
01:05:29,471 --> 01:05:33,725
Our whole cheering career,
we've staked our reputation
on being the best,

910
01:05:33,851 --> 01:05:35,686
the most inventive.

911
01:05:35,769 --> 01:05:41,066
Now we finally have a chance
to truly be original,
and you're all running scared.

912
01:05:41,191 --> 01:05:44,611
She's crazy.
Iam not crazy,

913
01:05:44,736 --> 01:05:46,655
and I知 not resigning
as captain either.

914
01:05:46,738 --> 01:05:49,408
- You're gonna have
to kill me first.
- That can be arranged.

915
01:05:49,491 --> 01:05:51,410
Shut it, Whitney!
Let her talk!

916
01:05:51,535 --> 01:05:56,123
Look, I know I've screwed up
royally as captain,

917
01:05:56,206 --> 01:05:59,710
but I believe in this squad,
and I know we can
bounce back from this.

918
01:05:59,793 --> 01:06:04,047
I'm not saying
it's gonna be easy.
It's gonna be hard work.

919
01:06:04,173 --> 01:06:07,801
We need a new routine,
something amazing and fresh,

920
01:06:07,926 --> 01:06:10,888
and we've got less than
three weeks till nationals,

921
01:06:10,971 --> 01:06:13,974
but if we can do it,
if we can pull this off,

922
01:06:14,099 --> 01:06:17,019
then we can really
call ourselves original.

923
01:06:17,102 --> 01:06:18,896
Now who's with me?

924
01:06:19,021 --> 01:06:20,689
All right!
Yeah.
Yeah!

925
01:06:20,814 --> 01:06:22,691
Yeah!

926
01:06:22,816 --> 01:06:25,485
How 'bout it, girls?
It's gonna be hard
without you two.

927
01:06:25,569 --> 01:06:28,197
Fine.

928
01:06:29,823 --> 01:06:31,742
Sure.
Whatever.

929
01:06:31,825 --> 01:06:34,369
Okay. Let's do this.

930
01:06:34,494 --> 01:06:38,165
We're gonna devote
every waking hour to practice...

931
01:06:38,290 --> 01:06:40,876
before school,
in between classes
and after school.

932
01:06:41,001 --> 01:06:44,129
Afternoon practices
will have to be twice as long.

933
01:06:44,213 --> 01:06:47,966
We've gotta do
whatever it takes to be
in perfect physical shape.

934
01:06:48,091 --> 01:06:49,968
Yeah. You can go
a little harder.

935
01:06:51,803 --> 01:06:54,473
Yeah, that feels good.
Maybe we should
join the squad.

936
01:06:54,598 --> 01:06:57,059
Push.
Oh, yeah.
Fag!

937
01:06:58,852 --> 01:07:03,482
And since
the football team sucks
no matter how hard we cheer,

938
01:07:03,565 --> 01:07:05,567
we'll use night games
to practice too.

939
01:07:05,692 --> 01:07:08,278
But that's not all.

940
01:07:08,403 --> 01:07:11,573
We're gonna study
other types of movement,
from swing dance...

941
01:07:11,657 --> 01:07:15,327
to interpretive dance,
...you grow and you
grow and you bloom!

942
01:07:15,452 --> 01:07:18,413
even mime.

943
01:07:18,455 --> 01:07:20,624
We'll draw inspiration
from martial arts,
Hah!

944
01:07:20,749 --> 01:07:23,335
musicals, everything.

945
01:07:25,254 --> 01:07:28,090
You guys know
we've got the talent.

946
01:07:28,215 --> 01:07:34,096
We've just gotta work our asses
off and trust our instincts...
all of our instincts.

947
01:07:42,980 --> 01:07:46,525
Tor! Wha... Wow!
What are you doing here?

948
01:07:46,608 --> 01:07:49,528
Just wanted to
come by and see you.
Is this a bad time?

949
01:07:49,653 --> 01:07:51,530
Yeah.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

950
01:07:51,655 --> 01:07:53,907
I'm super busy.
I'm workin'
on this project...

951
01:07:54,032 --> 01:07:55,993
Yeah, you sound super busy.

952
01:07:56,076 --> 01:07:59,746
I guess that's it.
You were too busy
to believe in me.

953
01:07:59,872 --> 01:08:01,748
Oh. No, no, but wait.

954
01:08:01,874 --> 01:08:04,626
You weren't too busy
to sell me out to Courtney
and Whitney, were you?

955
01:08:04,710 --> 01:08:07,462
Gee, now I知 confused.

956
01:08:07,546 --> 01:08:11,842
Well, I hope you're not
too busy to hear this.

957
01:08:11,967 --> 01:08:14,803
Kiss my ass, Aaron!
It's over!

958
01:08:20,142 --> 01:08:22,144
You're a great
cheerleader, Aaron.

959
01:08:22,227 --> 01:08:24,730
It's just that...

960
01:08:24,855 --> 01:08:27,691
maybe you're not exactly
boyfriend material.

961
01:08:27,816 --> 01:08:30,194
Bye-bye.

962
01:08:32,279 --> 01:08:34,698
You're a cheerleader?

963
01:08:43,290 --> 01:08:47,794
U.C.A. just posted the nationals
list on the Internet.
East Compton isn't on it.

964
01:08:47,920 --> 01:08:49,796
They couldn 't raise
the money in time.

965
01:08:49,922 --> 01:08:53,258
- They're not going.
- What do you mean,
"They're not going"?

966
01:08:53,383 --> 01:08:55,636
Torrance,
that's goodnews.

967
01:08:55,761 --> 01:08:57,804
They cannot not go.
That's not good news.

968
01:08:57,930 --> 01:09:01,225
What are you talking about?
They don't go, we win.
Once again we're the best.

969
01:09:01,308 --> 01:09:05,103
I define best as competing
against the best there is
out there and beating them.

970
01:09:05,187 --> 01:09:08,440
- They have to go.

971
01:09:08,524 --> 01:09:13,320
It's so unfair. The first
inner-city squad to get a bid,
and they can't afford to go?

972
01:09:13,445 --> 01:09:16,740
Look, Mom. Her head is spinning
off into another dimension.
Justin!

973
01:09:16,823 --> 01:09:20,160
The company gets hit up
for money all the time, honey.
I just can't.

974
01:09:20,244 --> 01:09:22,913
It's not that much money,
Mr. Level-Playing-Field.

975
01:09:22,996 --> 01:09:25,082
Tell them the deal.
Maybe they'll wanna help.

976
01:09:25,207 --> 01:09:27,459
Yeah? Okay,
I値l make the call,

977
01:09:27,584 --> 01:09:29,461
but they'll probably
say no.

978
01:09:29,586 --> 01:09:32,756
Don't let them.
Think of how much
it'll mean to East Compton.

979
01:09:32,840 --> 01:09:34,758
They deserve to go.

980
01:09:34,883 --> 01:09:37,719
Do the right thing, Dad!

981
01:09:41,723 --> 01:09:44,810
Did that
just happen?
Yeah.

982
01:09:44,935 --> 01:09:47,604
"Where we come from,
'cheer' is not a word
we hear very often."

983
01:09:47,729 --> 01:09:50,524
"They should call us
'inspiration leaders'
instead."

984
01:09:50,607 --> 01:09:52,734
Oh, that's deep.
I like that.

985
01:09:52,818 --> 01:09:54,820
I don't know why
we writin' to some
talk-show host.

986
01:09:54,903 --> 01:09:57,072
It's like we beggin'
for charity.
It's not charity.

987
01:09:57,197 --> 01:09:59,074
Pauletta Patton's
from our neighborhood.

988
01:09:59,199 --> 01:10:02,160
- She'll understand
why we need the money.
- Tell her we need to buy donuts.

989
01:10:02,286 --> 01:10:04,621
- Her big butt
will understand that.
- Ha-ha!

990
01:10:04,705 --> 01:10:07,040
- Stop being
counterproductive, all right?
- Lava, please...

991
01:10:07,165 --> 01:10:09,334
stop teaching her
these big words
before she choke on one.

992
01:10:09,459 --> 01:10:12,754
No, better I choke you, Lafred.

993
01:10:12,880 --> 01:10:15,591
- Look, Jenelope...
- You guys, stop! Please.

994
01:10:15,716 --> 01:10:18,927
Damn!

995
01:10:19,052 --> 01:10:21,847
Well, tell her about
the late-night practices
we been having.

996
01:10:21,972 --> 01:10:24,725
There you go.
That's the kind of stuff
she wants to hear about.

997
01:10:24,850 --> 01:10:26,810
Now we're talkin'.

998
01:10:42,409 --> 01:10:44,286
You guys have to go
to nationals.

999
01:10:44,411 --> 01:10:47,039
- Did you come up here
just to tell me that?
- Here.

1000
01:10:47,164 --> 01:10:50,667
I got my dad's company
to sponsor you guys.
What is this, hush money?

1001
01:10:50,751 --> 01:10:54,004
No.
Oh, right.
It's guilt money.

1002
01:10:54,129 --> 01:10:56,340
You pay our way in
and you sleep better
at night...

1003
01:10:56,465 --> 01:11:00,385
knowing how your whole world
is based on one
big, old fat lie.

1004
01:11:00,511 --> 01:11:03,055
Well, you know what?

1005
01:11:05,557 --> 01:11:08,393
- We don't need you.

1006
01:11:08,435 --> 01:11:12,439
Why do you have to be so mean?
I'm just trying to do
the right thing here.

1007
01:11:12,564 --> 01:11:16,276
I'm trying to be strong
for my squad, okay?
That's what a captain does.

1008
01:11:16,318 --> 01:11:20,322
Well, I知 a captain too,
you know, and I知 trying
to make it right.

1009
01:11:21,865 --> 01:11:24,076
You wanna
make it right?

1010
01:11:24,117 --> 01:11:26,703
Then when you go to nationals,
bring it.

1011
01:11:26,828 --> 01:11:29,790
Don't slack off because
you feel sorry for us.

1012
01:11:29,915 --> 01:11:33,252
That way, when we beat you,
we'll know it's because
we're better.

1013
01:11:33,377 --> 01:11:35,754
I'll bring it.

1014
01:11:35,838 --> 01:11:38,382
- Don't worry.
- I never do.

1015
01:11:44,680 --> 01:11:47,015
Yeah, your parents
just have to sign it.

1016
01:11:47,099 --> 01:11:49,476
I didn't do
anything!

1017
01:11:49,560 --> 01:11:51,520
Bye.
Bye, Tor.

1018
01:11:59,987 --> 01:12:02,489
I listened to your tape.
I loved it.

1019
01:12:02,614 --> 01:12:05,576
Great.
Can I talk to you?

1020
01:12:05,659 --> 01:12:08,245
I was upset that night.
Aaron gave me a ride home.

1021
01:12:08,370 --> 01:12:10,247
It was just
a good-night kiss.
It meant nothing.

1022
01:12:10,372 --> 01:12:13,041
Oh. I'm sorry.

1023
01:12:13,166 --> 01:12:16,837
And I wanted you
to know that...
I broke up with him.

1024
01:12:16,920 --> 01:12:18,922
Congratulations.

1025
01:12:21,341 --> 01:12:23,260
He didn't
believe in me.

1026
01:12:23,343 --> 01:12:25,262
You did!
Whatever.

1027
01:12:25,387 --> 01:12:29,600
That's important to me!
You believed in me!

1028
01:12:33,520 --> 01:12:37,441
A groovy kind of way
A groovy kind of way

1029
01:12:37,524 --> 01:12:40,485
A groovy kind of way
A groovy kind of way

1030
01:12:40,611 --> 01:12:43,947
A groovy kind of way
A groovy kind of way

1031
01:12:44,031 --> 01:12:47,451
- A groovy kind of way
A groovy kind of way
- Bite me.

1032
01:12:47,576 --> 01:12:50,787
Hanging out with the airheads
has really sharpened
your verbal skills, huh?

1033
01:12:50,871 --> 01:12:54,208
- Screw you.
- Said the cheerleader.

1034
01:12:54,291 --> 01:12:58,629
That's right,
I am a cheerleader,
and you're a dumb ass.

1035
01:12:58,712 --> 01:13:00,839
Torrance likes you.

1036
01:13:00,964 --> 01:13:03,008
Okay? She likes you.

1037
01:13:03,133 --> 01:13:05,928
She has an odd way
of showing it.
Don't be stupid.

1038
01:13:06,053 --> 01:13:09,431
She broke up with
her boyfriend for you.
Yeah.

1039
01:13:09,556 --> 01:13:14,603
Look. Do us all a favor
and get over yourself
and tell her how you feel.

1040
01:13:14,686 --> 01:13:16,647
I thought I had.

1041
01:13:16,772 --> 01:13:19,316
Well, try again.

1042
01:13:19,399 --> 01:13:22,945
And let me give you
a little tip
from a cheerleader.

1043
01:13:23,070 --> 01:13:26,406
Be aggressive.
Be-ee aggressive.

1044
01:13:29,076 --> 01:13:30,994
Now back to Pauletta!

1045
01:13:31,078 --> 01:13:33,247
Thank you.
Thank you.

1046
01:13:33,288 --> 01:13:35,707
Today on Pauletta
it's "Wish Day"!

1047
01:13:37,918 --> 01:13:41,588
]
Today's letter comes
from East Compton, California.

1048
01:13:41,713 --> 01:13:43,966
"Dear Pauletta:
Where we come from...

1049
01:13:44,049 --> 01:13:46,552
"cheer is not a word
that you hear very often,

1050
01:13:46,635 --> 01:13:51,223
"but that's what we are,
the cheerleaders
of East Compton High School.

1051
01:13:51,348 --> 01:13:56,228
"They should really call us
inspiration leaders,
because that's what we do.

1052
01:13:56,353 --> 01:13:58,272
"We inspire the people
from our neighborhoods...

1053
01:13:58,397 --> 01:14:00,816
"to believe
that our team can win.

1054
01:14:00,941 --> 01:14:03,527
"That's why we're asking you
to fulfill our wish...

1055
01:14:03,610 --> 01:14:08,240
to send us to the national
cheerleading competition
for the first time."

1056
01:14:08,323 --> 01:14:11,535
Well, Clovers,
you got your wish.

1057
01:14:11,660 --> 01:14:14,079
Audience,
the East Compton Clovers!

1058
01:14:18,542 --> 01:14:22,921
Hi, Pauletta.
Wejust wanna say how thankful
we are for all of your help.

1059
01:14:23,005 --> 01:14:27,009
Pauletta,
you my girl!
You the bomb, baby!

1060
01:14:27,092 --> 01:14:29,136
Ooh, Pauletta, girl,
we love you so much, girl.

1061
01:14:29,219 --> 01:14:32,347
You don't have to lose
a pound. We love you
the way you are!

1062
01:14:32,431 --> 01:14:35,017
- We're gonna make you
an honorary Clover for life.

1063
01:14:35,142 --> 01:14:37,060
Thank you so much.
Yeah!

1064
01:14:40,230 --> 01:14:42,858
Ooh! I'm gonna
look good in this, y'all.

1065
01:14:53,118 --> 01:14:55,245
So, your family
coming?

1066
01:14:55,370 --> 01:14:58,040
I don't know
if Cliff's coming.

1067
01:14:58,165 --> 01:15:00,167
I totally blew it
with Cliff.

1068
01:15:00,250 --> 01:15:02,169
Forget it.
My brother's an idiot.

1069
01:15:02,252 --> 01:15:04,671
You're his sister.
You don't see him
like I do.

1070
01:15:04,796 --> 01:15:07,633
Yeah, and that's
a good thing, 'cause
that would be a crime.

1071
01:15:09,927 --> 01:15:12,888
Hey, ladies, wanna see
my Spirit Stick?

1072
01:15:21,939 --> 01:15:24,191
Hey, this is Cliff.
Leave a message after the...

1073
01:15:26,693 --> 01:15:28,862
Hello. Hello?

1074
01:15:31,156 --> 01:15:33,116
Lock your door.
Boltyour windows.

1075
01:15:33,200 --> 01:15:36,370
Daytona, Florida,
hasbeen invaded
by teenage cheerleaders.

1076
01:15:36,453 --> 01:15:38,455
And what do they want?

1077
01:15:38,539 --> 01:15:41,583
The chance to be the number one
cheerleading squad
in the country.

1078
01:15:41,708 --> 01:15:45,879
You know, in high school,
couldn't pay a cheerleader
to talk to me.

1079
01:15:46,004 --> 01:15:48,298
Now, I知 surrounded by 'em,
and let's face it,

1080
01:15:48,340 --> 01:15:53,303
any sport
that combines gymnastics, dance
and short skirts is okay by me.

1081
01:15:53,387 --> 01:15:56,932
ESPN 2 welcomes you
to sunny Daytona, Florida,

1082
01:15:57,057 --> 01:16:00,394
for the Universal
Cheer Association
Nationals 2000.

1083
01:16:00,519 --> 01:16:03,981
Fifty squads from fifty high
schools across the nation...

1084
01:16:04,106 --> 01:16:06,358
are gathered here
to duke it out.

1085
01:16:06,441 --> 01:16:09,611
You wanna talk pressure?
Ha-ha. These kids
are feelin 'it.

1086
01:16:09,736 --> 01:16:13,699
One individual mistake
can cost a squad everything.

1087
01:16:13,782 --> 01:16:18,662
Who's got spirit?
We do, baby.
Only on the Deuce.

1088
01:16:29,173 --> 01:16:32,801
Hey. Watch goin' out
of bounds. They deduct
like crazy for that stuff.

1089
01:16:32,926 --> 01:16:34,803
You goin' for sainthood
or somethin'?

1090
01:16:34,928 --> 01:16:36,680
You don't wanna blow it
on something tiny.

1091
01:16:36,805 --> 01:16:39,808
Me and my squad
made it to the big show
without your help.

1092
01:16:39,933 --> 01:16:42,186
I think we can handle it.

1093
01:16:44,062 --> 01:16:47,357
Stay in bounds! If any
of you step outside that
ugly blue carpet, you are dead.

1094
01:16:47,441 --> 01:16:50,402
- Happy?
- Yes.

1095
01:16:50,485 --> 01:16:53,989
Tell your girl on the end
she's about a half second
early on all her moves.

1096
01:16:54,072 --> 01:16:56,992
- Okay, I will. Happy?
- Yep.

1097
01:16:58,452 --> 01:17:01,872
Hey, remember.
Bring it.

1098
01:17:05,751 --> 01:17:07,628
And what the hell
was that about?

1099
01:17:07,753 --> 01:17:09,713
It's boom, boom.

1100
01:17:09,796 --> 01:17:11,798
We just understand
each other, that's all.

1101
01:17:14,426 --> 01:17:17,846
All right, let's do this.
One, two, three.
Clovers!

1102
01:18:48,562 --> 01:18:53,358
The field has been narrowed,
and the advancing squads will
move on to tomorrow's finals.

1103
01:18:53,483 --> 01:18:55,986
Defending champs, the Toros,
have managed to come back...

1104
01:18:56,111 --> 01:18:58,739
from a humiliating showing
at regionals,

1105
01:18:58,822 --> 01:19:04,244
but the real Cinderella story
here, of course, is the Clovers
of East Compton, California.

1106
01:19:06,580 --> 01:19:08,624
Kasey's popping zits again.

1107
01:19:08,707 --> 01:19:11,251
Gross, Kasey.
You're totally
bedaubing the mirror.

1108
01:19:11,376 --> 01:19:13,837
Clean it off.
Okay, okay!

1109
01:19:18,175 --> 01:19:21,553
I don't know what's scarier,
neurotic cheerleaders
or the pressure to win.

1110
01:19:21,637 --> 01:19:24,473
I could make a killing
selling something like
Diet Prozac.

1111
01:19:24,598 --> 01:19:27,392
Thank God you're here
this season, Missy.

1112
01:19:27,476 --> 01:19:29,478
I couldn't have
done it alone.

1113
01:19:29,561 --> 01:19:32,564
Oh. Tear.
No, I mean it!

1114
01:19:39,071 --> 01:19:42,366
Shut up!
You don't have it yet,
you don't have it!

1115
01:19:42,491 --> 01:19:44,368
Give it up already!

1116
01:19:44,493 --> 01:19:47,621
Daytona, Florida,
day number two.

1117
01:19:47,746 --> 01:19:49,831
By sundown,
only one squad...

1118
01:19:49,957 --> 01:19:54,127
can call themselves
U.C.A. NationalChampions2000.

1119
01:19:57,005 --> 01:19:58,966
Shit!

1120
01:20:00,342 --> 01:20:02,845
Where the hell are
my spanky pants?

1121
01:20:02,970 --> 01:20:04,930
What's that
on his head?

1122
01:20:05,055 --> 01:20:07,349
Don't be shy, ladies.
Donations are always welcome.

1123
01:20:09,184 --> 01:20:11,478
Hey, babe. Are you
in a giving mood?

1124
01:20:12,604 --> 01:20:15,065
Sure.

1125
01:20:15,148 --> 01:20:17,317
- Aah!
- Get lost, freak,

1126
01:20:17,442 --> 01:20:19,903
or I知 gonna tell
your friends that you were
at a cheerleading competition.

1127
01:20:20,028 --> 01:20:22,698
- You wouldn't.
- Oh, I would.

1128
01:20:22,781 --> 01:20:27,327
- Hey, I recognize these.

1129
01:20:27,452 --> 01:20:33,208
That was perfect.
Your basket toss was amazing,
and no one saw that landing.

1130
01:20:34,334 --> 01:20:38,046
Really?
We should find
your tooth.

1131
01:20:41,884 --> 01:20:44,678
Colorado Springs, Colorado!
Hey.

1132
01:20:46,263 --> 01:20:48,765
That last lift you did
was amazing.

1133
01:20:48,849 --> 01:20:52,352
Thanks. Hey,
good luck out there.

1134
01:20:52,477 --> 01:20:54,438
Thanks, man.
I'm Les.

1135
01:20:54,563 --> 01:20:57,482
I'm... I知 Tim.
It's nice to meet you.

1136
01:20:57,566 --> 01:21:00,194
Hey, I値l, uh,
see you around?
Yeah.

1137
01:21:03,864 --> 01:21:06,325
Okay, now focus
and don't be nervous.

1138
01:21:06,366 --> 01:21:10,412
- I'm not nervous.
- No, just try not to think
about the stakes, okay?

1139
01:21:10,537 --> 01:21:13,040
I'm totally cool.
I'm so ready.

1140
01:21:13,165 --> 01:21:16,877
The main thing that you must
remember is always smile!

1141
01:21:22,674 --> 01:21:24,051
Sorry.

1142
01:21:24,134 --> 01:21:27,137
Man, my stomach
is killin' me!
Yo, relax, girl.

1143
01:21:27,262 --> 01:21:29,515
You're makin' me
even more nervous.

1144
01:21:29,598 --> 01:21:33,685
You guys, look.
Gather up.
Guys, we got this.

1145
01:21:33,769 --> 01:21:37,314
We have done this routine
a million times. Just relax.

1146
01:21:37,397 --> 01:21:41,235

Whoa, nice check.

I just want to say,
captain to captain,

1212
01:29:11,310 --> 01:29:13,187
I respect what
you guys did out there.

You guys were good.

You were better.

I don't believe
in curses anymore.

01:29:37,586 --> 01:29:39,588
Oh, really?
No.

1220
01:29:51,391 --> 01:29:53,310
Maybe we should
burn that, just in case.

1221
01:29:53,393 --> 01:29:56,355
Right!

1222
01:29:56,438 --> 01:30:00,984
Congratulations.
Oh, thanks.

1223
01:30:01,109 --> 01:30:03,695
Uh, you remember
my friend Torrance, right?

1224
01:30:03,820 --> 01:30:06,448
Yeah,
I think so.

1225
01:30:09,076 --> 01:30:11,036
We'll talk later.
Les!
