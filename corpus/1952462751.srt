Wake up. Wake up.

00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:23,600
Okay, don't worry about it,
I'm gonna get you out in a jiffy.

Got you! Okay, body you're free.

- You almost gave me a heart attack!
- Lenny, what are you doing?

12
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:42,080

Hey, mom said it's not okay to hit me!

15
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:49,200
Mom's not here.

00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:54,760
Don't. Don't!

17
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:59,800
What do you mean?
It's a theme song.

00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,920
Are they gone? Are they gone?

00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:55,040

Whale for a wash and the price,

00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,120
Oh my gosh.

101
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,520
Oh, may I suggest a monic peel?

00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,280
Removes lines and self damage.

103
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:16,000
- Good.

104
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:17,440
Oh my gosh! Hi Oscar!

00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,160
Yo, I'm sorry dog, Angie

00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:24,000

108
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:25,485
- Thanks, dog.

109
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:27,360
Come on Ange, dance with me, mama!

111
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:33,280
- Come on, Ange!
- Oscar! You're gonna get me fired!

112
00:07:33,315 --> 00:07:34,680
Please. You? Fired?

113
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:36,920
No, that can't happen, cause then I would have

114
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:39,600
absolutely no reason to come to work.

115
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:45,000
- You don't mean that.
- Of course I do. You're like my best friend.

116
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:50,360
Let me see, tell me what
you think about this,

117
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:53,280
this is like the best idea ever, allright?

118
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:56,520
This is a short thing guarantee
cash extravaganza.

119
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:00,920
- Bottled water.
- Oh, no.

120
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:04,160
All I need, is another advance
of my paycheck from deposite,

121
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:05,960
and Ange, I am out of this place!

122
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:11,240
Oscar, it's relegating mister Sykes face,

123
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:13,400
with another one you-get-rich-quick-skims.

124
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:14,760
Go to something you're actually good at.

125
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:19,080
Your job! Which is some of
a miracle you still have!

126
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:21,840
Almost forgot.

127
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:26,240
- I brought you some breakfast.
- You didn't.

128
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:28,200
- Shelly creams?
- Your favourite!

129
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:30,840
Oh, by the way, you're still on hold.

130
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:33,280
Oh my gosh! Thank you for holding!

131
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:34,960
Busy busy busy! Go!

132
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:35,920
How can I help you?

133
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:43,680
No, I'm sorrry, mister Sykes
is at the meeting right now.

134
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:45,080
He won't be'll back till later.

135
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,920
How are my little babies this morning?

136
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:58,200
You missed me? You're doing good?

137
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:05,360
You see, Sykes. It's a fish eat fish world.

138
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:07,560
You eat the take, or you get taken.

139
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:14,080
True words have never been spoken.

140
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:15,320
Is that it? That all? We're done?

141
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:19,880
Now you and me, we've worked
together a long, long, long time.

142
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:22,360
- Please, Don Lino, it's hardly been like worked!
- Let me finish.

143
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:24,000
- And you know...
- And I love that about you!

144
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:27,400
Let me finish! That I'd lived my life for my sons.

145
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:30,760
- Raising them and protecting them,
- You're the best! He's the best, right?!

146
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:31,960
- Teaching them.
- Am I right or am I wrong?

147
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,160
- Ha? Am I right?
- Sykes, it's all been to pre...

148
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:36,000
- Right?
- To prepared.

149
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:37,160
- Sorry.
- That's all right.

150
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:40,120
For the day they run the reef.

151
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:42,960
Well, today is that day.

152
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:47,280
Luca!

153
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:55,760
Hey boss! Big butts!

154
00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:01,920
Allright, to make long story short, from now on,

155
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:04,960
you work for Franki and Lenny, capish?

156
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:08,560
Lenny? Franki I understand, but Lenny?

157
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:10,600
- You can't be serious.
- That's serious.

158
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:12,600
It takes not only muscle to run things,

159
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:16,320
now Lenny, he's got the brains,
that's something special.

160
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:18,880
- Oh yeah, he's special.
- What's that supossed to mean?

161
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:22,960
- Nothing, nothing, I'm just saying.
- I bring you in here, look you in the eye

162
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,040
tell you what's what and what?
- What?

163
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:28,005
- What what?
- What what nothing!

164
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:30,840
- You said what first!
- I did say what first, I asked you what.

165
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,880
No, you said it then what, and I said what?

166
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:35,240
No, I said what what! Like what what!

167
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:39,400
- You said what first.
- Now you make a fun of me?!

168
00:10:39,435 --> 00:10:41,240
No, no, no, you misunderstood,
you misunderstood.

169
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:43,160
Sorry, we're late, pap.
Lenny had an accident.

170
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:46,960
- He was born!
- He, he, he. You're comic genious!

171
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,920
Look, all I'm saying is
that kid ain't exactly no killer!

172
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:51,920
My Lenny is a killer, you hear me?

173
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:54,120
A cold blooded killer! Look at him!

174
00:10:58,040 --> 00:10:58,680
Yeah?

175
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:04,280
That's it! That's it! You are out!

176
00:11:04,315 --> 00:11:04,960
What?

177
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:08,440
- What do you mean I'm out?
- You're fired!

178
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:14,080
And on top of that, you're gonna
have to start paying me!

179
00:11:14,115 --> 00:11:15,600
- For what?
- So not have us to that

180
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:17,400
little whale wash of yours!

181
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:18,600
WHALE.

182
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:19,840
Welcome to Oscar's crib.

183
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:22,400
Sixty foot slide covered tomb.

184
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:25,640
There's swimming casualties and plankton

185
00:11:25,675 --> 00:11:28,320
across the deep, when you feel a little...

186
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:31,160
old school.

187
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,760
Oh stop your moaning, Oscar!

188
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:34,400
That could be a lot worse, you know?

189
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:37,360
Yeah, that's true. I can have
this job and look like you!

190
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:41,120
Who's behind me? Who's behind me!
Babe, give me some!

191
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:46,760
Indigestion.

192
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:49,600
She's gonna blow!

193
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:51,920
Wait! Headphone guy's still in there!

194
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:57,720
I get you! Hang on!

195
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:11,480
- Still think it could be worse?
- Yeah! I can look like you!

196
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:16,240
You're funny. We'll see
how you laugh at this!

197
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:27,200
Soap in the eye! Soap in the eye!

198
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:35,240
It's all right. It's all right. Look,

199
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:37,960
I'm gonna get you some cool pies,
we'll get you free hot wax

200
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,280
and all that, you like that?

201
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:41,440
- Allright, go at it, big baby.
- Thanks, Oscar.

202
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:42,525
All right.

203
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:46,280
- Ernie look, who's burning!
- Just the fish we were looking for!

204
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:49,200
- Yeah.
- The boss wants to see you right now!

205
00:12:49,235 --> 00:12:51,440
- Right now!
- Ernie! Bernie!

206
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:53,000
My jelly fish brothers, voodoo!

207
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:56,200
Hey what's up, men?
Ah men, good to see you!

208
00:12:57,880 --> 00:13:00,640
Fellows, I'm gonna ahead,

209
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:03,320
over there with Don Worby.

210
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:13,520
That's not the way
you sing that song, man!

211
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:22,320
Hey Sykes! My brother from another mother!

212
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:23,800
What's the day is it, baby?

213
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:26,565
What's going down?

214
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:28,840
Hey baby, this is all gravy today, allright

215
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:30,560
snap you fin, right on it. Snap it!

216
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:32,040
- You are not snapping it!
- Oscar!

217
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:35,080
Hey, don't sweat it, Sykes,
a lot of other fish can do it.

218
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:36,360
Oscar, would you just sit down, okay?

219
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:38,800
- Thank you!
- Look, I've been gone off for my markets.

220
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:41,840
Your owe to me is five grand! Five gees, okay?

221
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:46,280
- Five gees? Man, it's not five gees!
- See if this refreshes your memory!

222
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:50,680
Wow! That's crazy! Look at that!

223
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:54,080
You wrote everything down
so you wouldn't forget!

224
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:56,760
Wow! This is a perfect example why you're

225
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:59,440
in management and I'm not. You go boy.

226
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:01,480
Look, I have to start paying
Don Lino for protection,

227
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:04,320
so everything you owe me, you owe him!
- How did you figured that?

228
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:06,280
It's simple. The food chain.

229
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:08,680
You see, on top there's Don Lino. There's me.

230
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:10,400
- And there's regular fish.
- And there's me!

231
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:14,360
No, there's plankton, there's single celominas.

232
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:17,080
- Then there's me.
- I'm getting to that, there's coral.

233
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:19,640
There's rocks. There's whale poo.

234
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:20,920
And then there's you!

235
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:24,160
- There's my stuff.
- So after he's squeezing me,

236
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:26,080
he's squeezing you!
- What?

237
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:28,200
Wow! I'm sorry, I'm sorry!

238
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:31,200
- Easy boss, find your happy place.
- Happy place!

239
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:32,760
There's is no happy place with him around!

240
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:37,160
Okay, okay, okay. Please,
please just give some time,

241
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:40,280
that's all I'm asking!
I'm begging you, Sykes, please!

242
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:44,800
- Please!
- All right.

243
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:49,760
Cause I like you. I'm gonna give you
twenty-four hours to pay out.

244
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:50,760
All of it?

245
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:52,920
- How will I do that?
- That's your problem.

246
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:54,920
Bring my five thousand clams

247
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:56,560
tomorrow, or else...
- Or else what?

248
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:57,840
The boys will explain you.

249
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:03,400
Unpleasant!

250
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:07,320
Five thousand clams?!

251
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:11,560
You borrowed five thousand
clams from mister Sykes?

252
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:15,520
Oscar, why do you get yourself
into these situations?

253
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:19,920
I don't know, Ange,
it's just hard, allright?

254
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:25,040
Because I'm a little fish
in a big pot. A really big pot.

255
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:26,560
The ocean.

256
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:30,440
I'm nobody.

257
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:34,600
- I want some of that!
- Missis Sanches?

258
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:40,200
Uh, no. That.

259
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,840
The top of the reef. Where
the somebodies live.

260
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:49,120
I wanna be rich and famous like them!

261
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:54,640
- But I'm stuck down here.
- Well, what's wrong with down here?

262
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:56,680
I'll tell you what's wrong with down here.

263
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:01,000
Remember my dad? He worked
at the washes the whole life.

264
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:07,840
He was the number one tongue scrubber.

265
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:11,480
Every year for twenty-five years.

266
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:16,200
To me working at the wash

267
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:19,680
was the coolest job in the ocean.

268
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:23,360
But then I've learned something
I would never forget.

269
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:26,640
Ha, ha! Oscar dad's the tongue scruber!

270
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:31,840
Tongue scrubber! Tongue scrubber!

271
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:36,720
My dad was the greatest.

272
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:40,520
But nobody loves nobody.

273
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:46,560
- I wanna be a somebody!
- Oscar, you don't have

274
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:49,440
to live at the top of the reef
to be a somebody.

275
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:55,520
What's the difference, if I don't pay
mister Sykes' beg by tomorrow.

276
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:57,920
I'm dead anyway.

277
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:02,120
Wait here.

278
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:16,400
What's this?

279
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:21,680
- A pink pearl?
- Hm.

280
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:25,040
- Where did you get that?
- My grandmother gave it to me.

281
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:30,360
She said it started from a tiny grand of sand,

282
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:33,480
but then after a while,

283
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:37,240
it grew in something beautiful.

284
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:43,440
- Dreams can begin small too.
- No, I couldn't.

285
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:47,440
Take it! It'll get you the money
you need for mister Sykes.

286
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:56,920
What's new on the stand? I'd been
on all over this a thousand times,

287
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:58,120
I don't wanna to say it again.

288
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:00,560
You know, you've really given
me actually, you know that?

289
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:02,320
I don't know how else
to say this to you, Lenny.

290
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:04,400
You see something, you kill it
and you eat it. Period.

291
00:18:04,435 --> 00:18:07,320
Thanks. That's what sharks do!

292
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:09,720
That's a fine tradition.
What's the matter with you?

293
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:12,680
Your brother Franki here, he's a killer.

294
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:14,280
- Right, pap.
- He's beautiful,

295
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:16,920
he does what he's supposed
to do! Wipe your face.

296
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:19,440
But you...

297
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:21,680
I'm hearing things...

298
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:25,160
You gotta understand,
when you look week,

299
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:27,280
it make me look week.
- I know, pap.

300
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:30,760
- I'm sorry.
- Lenny, Lenny, look at me.

301
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:32,040
Look at me!

302
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:35,680
This ain't nobody's business,
this is for you! It's for both of you!

303
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:38,480
And you're acting like
you don't even want it!

304
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:41,400
I need to know that you can handle that.

305
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:50,080
Right here in front of me now, eat this.

306
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:54,120
Yeah, oh Jee! Thanks pap.

307
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:57,000
Here's the thing. I'm on a diet,

308
00:18:57,040 --> 00:19:00,200
and I've read an article about these
shrimps, they are not good for you,

309
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:03,520
you know how many calories are in one shrimp?

310
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:06,680
- A lot!
- It's true! It's true,

311
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:07,720
and the other thing is,

312
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:11,040
my sister had a baby and I took her baby,

313
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:14,200
cause she past away, and then the baby lost it's legs,

314
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:16,640
and it's all I wasn't suppose I gonna stop,

315
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:18,880
but I still take care of him with my wife.

316
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:24,920
It's crawling and it's fearly
happy, it's difficult, cause

317
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:27,520
I've been working on a
second shift at the factory,

318
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:30,365
there put food on the table, all the love

319
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:34,360
and I see that little guy's tears,
it's the worst in the world.

320
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:37,840
Front story.

321
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:44,920
I'm not asking you anymore, I'm telling you,

322
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:47,240
eat it!
- No! Have mercy!

323
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:48,640
- Pap, please!
- Eat!

324
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:49,880
- Don't eat!
- What are you...

325
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:51,320
- Son, eat...
- No!

326
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:52,640
the shrimp!
- Please!

327
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:55,520
- No, please, no!
- Lenny! Eat! Eat, eat, eat!

328
00:19:55,555 --> 00:19:58,360
- Eat, eat, eat, eat!
- Put the shrimp down!

329
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,720
All right, go now. No one's
looking. Get out of here!

330
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:08,080
- You're free. Go on, go, go!
- Thank you. You're good person.

331
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:14,120
Come on, fellows!

332
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:26,800
- Papa, why can't I handle the reef?
- No! No! We're gonna do this as a family.

333
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:29,880
Franki, I want you to take Lenny
out, and show him the rules.

334
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:32,800
- Oh come on, pap.
- Son you're gonna learn how to be a shark!

335
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:34,680
Will you like it or not.

336
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:44,560
- That kid better show up, or he's dead meat!
- Yes, at a word, boss.

337
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:48,840
Get a whole load of the money,
give it to mister Sykes.

338
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:50,160
Come on, hurry up, hurry up!

339
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:52,520
- This is our chance, you don't wanna miss it!
- Are you sure about this?

340
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:54,520
A friend of friend of mine tipped me off!

341
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:58,080
- Race is rigged. We can't lose!
- Well what's the horses name?

342
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:00,080
Lucky day.

343
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:04,000
LUCKY DAY
SEABISCUIT

344
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:09,080
- We're gonna be rich. Rich!
- Top of the reef, here I come!

345
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:11,400
No, wait! What am I doing?

346
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:13,160
Remember what Angie said,
remember what Angie said.

347
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:16,000
What did Angie say?

348
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:21,040
Dreams can begin small,
you just have to bet it all!

349
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:22,520
Bet it all!

350
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:32,920
Five thousand on Lucky day to win!

351
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:35,240
That's two hundred a one!

352
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:41,320
- That would pay a million clams!
- Than I guess it makes me, Oscar la millionaire.

353
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:48,040
Lucky day! Lucky day! Lucky day!

354
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:09,120
Nice bet.

355
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:17,440
You have a name?

356
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:20,760
You wanna tell me what it is?

357
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:23,680
Well mine's Lola.

358
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:27,000
Come on man! Get it handled yourself!

359
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:30,400
So...

360
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:33,560
Lola, my name's O...

361
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:37,360
My name is Oscar, sweety.

362
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:40,760
- Missis Sanches!
- I hate when it hops,

363
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:43,240
smooth dog, don't work with me!

364
00:22:43,275 --> 00:22:45,680
- No, my bad. Hey! So...
- Oscar!

365
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:47,800
I was starting to think
you skipped on on me.

366
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:50,240
Sykes! Hey! I see you...

367
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,645
already to your way to the cashier stand.

368
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:54,640
- What are doing?
- You mind bring us back some drinks?

369
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:56,360
- Why are you touching me?
- That'll be great man, thanks.

370
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:57,560
Oh I know, I'll bring back

371
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:00,320
some of little winner thing!
- You mean the one with the toothpicks?

372
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:03,000
- What are doing? Don't listen to him!
- Come on Lola, let me escort you to...

373
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:05,520
my box.
- Your box?

374
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:08,400
His box? You can't even afford
the gum to the seats!

375
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:11,920
He just laid five grand on Lucky day,
I think he can afford

376
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:13,200
anything he wants!

377
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:17,280
Five grand? My five grand?

378
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:20,400
- No, it was another five grand.
- You had the money to pay me back

379
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:22,040
and you bet it anyway?
- Hold on.

380
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:23,205
- Give me that!
- Sykes!

381
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:26,440
- Clearly I've made a mistake.
- No! No, wait! Lola!

382
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:29,640
Look, deep down, I'm really superficial.

383
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:32,480
And don't get me wrong, you're cute, but

384
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:34,360
you are a nobody.

385
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:39,600
Oscar, you're cute, but you are a nobody.

386
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:43,000
Wait Lola! Come back! I'm not a nobody!

387
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:44,960
I'm a winner!

388
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:49,480
You are unbelievable, you're
in trouble up to your gilles,

389
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:51,080
and still, you're asking for more?

390
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:54,240
Now go on, get in here!
Oscar, you better pray

391
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:55,680
that this horse of yours comes through.

392
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:57,280
You bet my five thousand!

393
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:00,240
Hey! Hey! Hey! Out of my seat!
You, out of my seat!

394
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:02,360
Unbelievable! Unbelievable!

395
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:05,400
- Sit tight and watch the race.
- With your good eye!

396
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:09,320
Horses are ready on the post.

397
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:13,480
Race is going special by
Seabiscuit and some of other!

398
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:16,120
The long shoulder Lucky day appears
of having trouble of getting

399
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:17,485
out of the gates.
- What?

400
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:19,200
Only a sucker could have bet on him!

401
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:21,560
No, no, no, don't sweat it man,
he does this all the time,

402
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:23,000
he just blam.
- Oh, what's this?

403
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:25,880
Lucky day has crossed his way through the gates!

404
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:27,160
And he's off for running!

405
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:30,680
That was straight away
Seabiscuit forcing on Lucky day!

406
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:32,760
Fast! Go fast!

407
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:35,440
Coming round the fall tone the Seabiscuit riding,

408
00:24:35,475 --> 00:24:37,640
and Lucky day well behind the pack.

409
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:40,720
And in comes Lucky day!
Coming up from behind!

410
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:42,880
He's passing other tales! Now or never!

411
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:44,880
Sykes, you see? Who's your fish now?

412
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:48,040
Around the final turn here comes Lucky day!

413
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:50,520
Lucky day is now calling the Fishfingers!

414
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:51,840
He gets ahead.

415
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:57,440
Wait, I'm getting tired, just beg him up!

416
00:24:57,480 --> 00:24:58,760
Look how Lucky day goes!

417
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:04,080
Absolutely amazing!

418
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:07,720
This is Lucky day's big day!

419
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:09,240
That's Lucky day!

420
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:16,800
What happened!
Lucky day is down!

421
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:23,400
No!

422
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:29,480
And here comes Fishfingers
followed by Seabiscuit yellow tail.

423
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:30,960
Fishfingers wins!

424
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,640
- What is it?
- Wait, wait, wait I just wanted to hold you!

425
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:35,680
Get out of my way, let me see!

426
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:37,320
Poor sad day for Lucky day!

427
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:40,560
And that's why they call him the low shot.

428
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:42,280
Yo, that was crazy, right?

429
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:44,360
Who knew? I mean everything's set,

430
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:46,480
there's a luck, we're good to go, we're in the money,

431
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:51,600
and he trips underwater. Who in a hell

432
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:53,520
trips underwater? And by the way...

433
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:56,440
That's it! That's it, I've had it.

434
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:59,720
Ernie, Bernie, I want you to find
the deepest, darkest hole in the ocean,

435
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:03,200
and when you do, dig deeper,
and put him in it!

436
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:11,640
Sorry kid, it's nothing personal. It's just business.

437
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:21,960
Don't worry about a day,

438
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:28,080
cause every little thing is gonna be all right!

439
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:30,160
- This is how you sing it, Oscar.
- Yeah.

440
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:34,360
Sykes, you like your money.
I set ticket easy on you.

441
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:38,520
- But Sykes is not here!
- True.

442
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:43,080
- Ernie, let me ask you a question.
- Yeah man, go on.

443
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:46,000
Why is it that millacscan sting on a people?

444
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:48,840
But they have no affect on you.

445
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:53,040
Ernie, I didn't mean it Ernie!
I didn't mean it man!

446
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:58,280
Ernie! You made a joke!

447
00:26:58,840 --> 00:27:01,320
- Good one man! Respect!
- Respect.

448
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:02,880
Load fire!

449
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:09,320
- Franki, you know I can't do this!
- Lenny, if you wanna make pap happy,

450
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:12,720
you gotta kill something!
- Or I could find a very old sick fish

451
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:14,160
and just wait!
- Oh.

452
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:16,320
This getting around, you think
of the day in the restaurant,

453
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:17,400
you know how fish pop!

454
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:19,560
Bit of bit, bit of bob,
this that the other, then

455
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:21,920
how you're doing? Boom!
Get a body here. Dead

456
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:25,280
Okay, seriously I can't
understand why this is so

457
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:28,320
you have to be more specific.
- More specific? You want specific?

458
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:31,880
- Be a shark, for once in your life!
- Oh, what am I gonna do?

459
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:35,920
Lenny, forget about it, okay?
We do a couple of practice,

460
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:38,360
but a bim, but a bom,
pap's happy, you're a shark,

461
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:41,040
life goes on! Capish?
- Okay.

462
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:44,240
- Okay, capish.
- Wait, wait, wait. Bingo.

463
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:48,600
Right there, there you see? TV dinner.

464
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:53,720
- Don't get lousy on this.
- All right. Come on. I am the tiger.

465
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:58,120
Franki, I can do this!
What if I can't do this?

466
00:27:58,160 --> 00:28:01,640
- Then don't bother coming home.
- Good point! All right.

467
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:03,280
Hit him in the tale again.

468
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:07,080
- I like his funny face, man.
- Funny face, yeah.

469
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:08,480
- Ernie!
- No!

470
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:21,160
Guys! Guys! Don't leave me alone!
Come on, there could be a shark out here!

471
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:31,160
Oh no, wait!

472
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:32,800
I'm sorry, no, no, no. I'm not gonna...

473
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:33,880
- Lenny!
- What?

474
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:35,040
Like this!

475
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:42,280
Oh my god! Just get off me!
Wait a minute!

476
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:45,680
Do me a favor, don't chew me,
I'm not for that.

477
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:49,280
- I'm not gonna eat you.
- Don't do the whole hit trip thing with me!

478
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:51,280
Listen to me, don't move until I tell you!

479
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:56,920
That's it, Lenny, here you go, body!

480
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:59,040
That's it, dig straight, baby. Dig it!

481
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,720
Look, I'm just pretending,
so you can get away.

482
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:04,920
When I turn around, you take off!

483
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:08,120
Tastes like chicken! Mhh.

484
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:13,240
- Oh no. No.
- What did I tell you!

485
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:15,120
I'm sorry, I didn't get it,
you want me to go now?

486
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:18,360
- What are you doing, just come home!
- That's it, I've had it up to here!

487
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:23,560
- Oh no!
- Hurry, swim!

488
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:26,640
- No, Franki wait!
- No, get your boy! Get your boy!

489
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:43,960
Franki!

490
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:50,680
Lenny,

491
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:56,000
- Lenny, is that you?
- I'm here, Franki.

492
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:58,440
- Come closer.
- Yes, what is it?

493
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:02,480
- I'm so cold.
- That's just because we're cold blooded.

494
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:05,800
Moron!

495
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:09,400
Franki, no!

496
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:13,000
No!

497
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:20,160
This is all my fault! I'm so sorry, Franki!

498
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:23,520
Oh my, how am I gonna
explain this to pap?

499
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:27,200
Oh no!

500
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:36,880
Watch it! Back off! I'm crazy! I will do it!

501
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:40,040
- Wow!
- Wow!

502
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:44,280
Oh, what a...

503
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:53,480
Don't hurt us, we're sorry!
It was all Ernie idea!

504
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:59,400
Oscar! Did you kill that shark?

505
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:07,240
All right, yeah! Yeah!

506
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:10,040
Exactly how it looked, that's how it is.

507
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:11,040
What happened!

508
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:16,280
- Oh, you want to know what happened?
- Yeah, you're standing on top of shark!

509
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:18,280
- Go on man!
- Well I'll tell you what happened!

510
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:23,440
Big old shark, seventy-five hundred feet long,

511
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:25,160
so he's swimming at me, right?

512
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:28,400
- With teeth like razors!
- Razors!

513
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:31,720
And it was all like, you want come at me like that,

514
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:34,000
you want come to all like that?

515
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:37,200
Dude, do the muscle thing, the muscle thing!

516
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:40,480
Oh right, right. So I told that dude,
I said do you see this guy?

517
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:42,800
And I pointed like this,
well he's got a brother.

518
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:44,920
And he lives right over here!

519
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:49,680
And I think it's time for a little
family reunion!

520
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:54,120
- You see man, I told you!
- Excuse me.

521
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:57,200
- We were right there, right there!
- Pardon me. Move it!

522
00:31:57,240 --> 00:32:00,400
Sorry, sorry! She seems so nice on TV.

523
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:03,000
Oscar, Katie Current. As a first fish in history,

524
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:04,845
that ever take on a shark and win, tell me,

525
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:06,960
does this mean you're now
the protector of the reef?

526
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:10,800
- New sheriff in town, the big cahuna?
- Katie, I'm a keeper of reef,

527
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:13,320
- I can call you Katie, right?
- Of course!

528
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:16,360
Any shark tries to mess
around in Oscar town,

529
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:17,600
is going down!

530
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:23,840
Yeah, just poetic, I mean poetic!

531
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:28,400
Oscar! Oscar.

532
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:31,280
Okay, get out of here, barracuda,

533
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:33,280
any further questions will be filled by me!

534
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:36,840
- And you are?
- I'm his manager, Sykes. With an Y.

535
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:39,240
And I'm his financial advisor!

536
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:43,360
You wanna see my puppets?

537
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:46,320
Hello!

538
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:49,760
Could you excuse for a moment, please?

539
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:52,520
- My manager?
- Kid, you're a superstar!

540
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:54,640
We're gonna make a fortune!
Just let me handle it.

541
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:56,480
- What about the five gees?
- Forget the five gees.

542
00:32:56,520 --> 00:32:59,600
- From now on we're partners!
- So what exactly are we talking about here?

543
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:02,400
- I'm thinking about 90/10 split.
- Well, that's actualy pretty generous.

544
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:03,920
You're the 10, I take my 90 off the top.

545
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:05,240
- I don't think so!
- Talk to me.

546
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:06,600
- You get 50!
- 70.

547
00:33:06,635 --> 00:33:07,440
- 20!
- 75.

548
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:08,720
Dude! You're going the wrong way!

549
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:10,765
- Fifty-fifty!
- Fifty-fifty!

550
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:11,960
- You're happy?
- No, you're happy?

551
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,400
- No! Deal!
- Deal!

552
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:20,280
My manager and I are now
prepared to take your questions.

553
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:23,480
Oscar, are you going to continue
working here at the wash?

554
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:25,320
Please, I bearly work here now!

555
00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:30,400
- Keep in up, kid. You're slaying them!
- No, he's slaying sharks!

556
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:32,200
Hey, that's good,
that's good, I like that!

557
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:34,400
Oscar, the Sharkslayer!

558
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:37,200
- Wow!
- A Sharkslayer!

559
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:38,840
You heard it here first, from now on,

560
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:41,040
any shark tries to bother this reef,

561
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:42,840
it's had its funeral.

562
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:57,880
I could fly high...

563
00:34:10,120 --> 00:34:13,200
- Franki, we'll miss you.
- To Franki!

564
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:19,000
It's a terrible thing, Don Lino.
Everybody loved Franki.

565
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:22,720
May whoever did this, die at thousand depths.

566
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:26,160
May his stinking maggy coffered corpse rot

567
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:27,680
in a fire depth of hell!

568
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:31,880
Thank you for your kind
thoughts, Giuseppe.

569
00:34:33,680 --> 00:34:36,000
Oh and may Lenny be
found safe and sound too.

570
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:39,760
- Hope he's okay.
- Oh Lenny.

571
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:44,280
- Don't worry, boss.
- I said some things to him...

572
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:48,480
- We' gotta find him.
- We're searching everywhere.

573
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:50,320
Forget about it, he'll turn up.

574
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:53,600
What's wrong with that kid?
Why does he gotta be so different?

575
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:59,000
Franki, god rest his soul,
he was perfect. Perfect!

576
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:04,440
Oh, Luca, who could have done this?

577
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:12,560
Don Lino, at this most difficult time,
please accept my deepest condolences.

578
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:13,960
Thank you, Don Brizzi,

579
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,080
for honouring my son with your song.

580
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:21,040
I got some news, about
the guy who took out Franki.

581
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:29,960
Hey, let's talk over here.

582
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:34,640
He come out of nowhere, this guy.

583
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:39,720
Calls himself the Sharkslayer.

584
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:45,840
- I'm here, over here.
- The Sharkslayer!

585
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:49,200
- Where do I find him?
- He's from the south side reef,

586
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:52,920
that's all we could dig up.
- Thank you, thank you.

587
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:57,000
- Any request?
- Luca.

588
00:35:57,040 --> 00:36:00,040
- How about that Titanic song?
- No, no!

589
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:02,880
Get Sykes, he knows that
reef better than anybody.

590
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:05,880
I wanna find this guy, I wanna
know everything about him,

591
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:07,960
I wanna know where he lives,
I wanna know where he sleeps,

592
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:11,760
he pops to kill, I wanna know
about it. Who is the Sharkslayer.

593
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:14,840
Here he is! The Sharkslayer!

594
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:31,520

598
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:07,880
Found that dog. Found it! Oscar,

599
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:10,360
- Yeah?
- Oh yeah.

602
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:20,200
- Angie! You made it!
- Hey, wait! You're gonna break my gift!

603
00:37:20,235 --> 00:37:22,560
Come on, you didn't have to get me anything.

604
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:26,640
- What did you get me?
- Well, what does every bachelor need!

605
00:37:26,675 --> 00:37:30,325
A lover lamp! How did you
know I love lover lamps?

606
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:32,800
You know what, I'm gonna put it
right here, next to my other one.

607
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:42,120
Hey, come Ange, I wanna show
the best thing about this place!

608
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:47,720
- Wow!
- How great is this view?

609
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:53,320
- Top of reef! It's amazing!
- I know, it's beautiful, right?

610
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:56,360
Like your, like your new appartment?

00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:58,960
It's... wow! Awesome!

612
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:04,080
All I'm trying to say, is that...

613
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:09,360
- I'm proud of you, Oscar.
- Yeah, it was nothing, really.

614
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:13,840
You know what? Wait
right here, don't move,

615
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:16,480
I'll be right back.
Girl, you are gonna flip!

616
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:22,120
- Wow! I'm back!
- Oh you're back!

617
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:26,120
You know what Ange,

or my dreams coming true,

620
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:34,960
you know, weird kind of way?

621
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:40,760
- I'd never could have done it without you.
- Oh, sure you could.

622
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:42,720
Well, probably not.

623
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:49,720
- Ange, here.
- Oh, Oscar!

624
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:55,040
I know, I know. Just sorry,
that it took so long.

625
00:38:55,080 --> 00:38:57,400
- Oh that's okay!
- Bam!

626
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:01,120

With entries! Now, I don't forget anything,

628
00:39:05,720 --> 00:39:07,760

629
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:18,765
Ange, I...

630
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:23,160
Oh, hi. I'm not interrupting

631
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:26,160
- Yes, we're talking!
- No! Hey Lola!

632
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:27,440

So you won't mind if I still

So, look who's a somebody after all!

00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:01,080
The Great Whites!

640
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,280
Okay, everbody go home,

Oh! I mean,

00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:18,120
that's the way it used to be around here.

644
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:21,040
We were all screaming, forgot our stuff but,

00:40:21,080 --> 00:40:23,040

00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:54,320
- Lenny!
- Hey! What are you doing?

653
00:40:54,360 --> 00:40:56,280
There's a Sharkslayer around here!

654
00:40:57,480 --> 00:41:01,520
Oh yeah, Lenny! Lenny!

655
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:06,640
- That was close.
- Super close.

656
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:11,440
Don't panic.

657
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:18,760
- Quiet, we're safe.
- No, not you again!

658
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:22,120
- Yeah, what was that?
- What is with you, man!

659
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:25,200
- Shh, he could be anywhere.
- Who?

660
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:28,760
Shh, the Sharkslayer.

661
00:41:29,640 --> 00:41:34,360
- There's no Sharkslayer around here.
- Yes, there is!

662
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:39,160
- No, there is not, trust me on this one.
- Get a hold of yourself, man!

663
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:42,960
- This is no time to act crazy!
- You're the one acting crazy! Crazy!

664
00:41:43,720 --> 00:41:46,160
You're right. You're right, I'm sorry.

665
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:47,920

667
00:41:57,600 --> 00:41:59,160
No, that's not all that.

668
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:01,120
- Just relax.
- It's my fault!

669
00:42:02,080 --> 00:42:07,360
- Not really, but still!
- Okay calm. You just need a little time.

670
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:09,520
- Man look, things are work out.
- You think?

671
00:42:09,560 --> 00:42:10,840
Yeah! So...

672
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:15,880
Look, I'll take off, and you
should just go home, okay?

673
00:42:15,960 --> 00:42:18,400
- Okay.
- Hey, good luck, dog.

674
00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:20,840
- Wait!
- What, man?

675
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:23,360
- I didn't catch your name.
- Oscar.

676
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:25,440
- I'm Lenny. Hi!
- Hi.

677
00:42:25,480 --> 00:42:29,440
- Where do you live?
- Lenny? Where I come from,

678
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:32,280
fish don't like to get
grabbed by sharks, okay?

679
00:42:32,320 --> 00:42:33,805
- Sorry.
- Go home!

680
00:42:33,840 --> 00:42:36,840
There is no home for me anymore.
Don't you understand that?

681
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:39,400
- You're too big to be grabbing me like this.
- Take me home with you.

682
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:41,480
- Shh! What?
- You won't even notice I'm in!

683
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:42,720
I'm like the invisible shark!

684
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:49,680
- Are you crazy?
- Please, I'm begging you,

685
00:42:49,720 --> 00:42:51,520
don't leave me alone!
- Shh!

686
00:42:51,560 --> 00:42:55,120
Yo! Put you fins on the wall,
where I could see them!

687
00:42:58,840 --> 00:43:02,080
- Got ya!
- Hey, yo! Shorty!

688
00:43:02,120 --> 00:43:04,280
- Oscar!
- What ya doing here?

689
00:43:04,320 --> 00:43:06,280
- Check out my mad bum!
- Check it out.

690
00:43:06,320 --> 00:43:07,800
Bum! There is!

691
00:43:07,840 --> 00:43:11,240
- Do you like it?
- You kids got some skills!

692
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:16,280
What did I tell you? You can
shooting be doing this!

693
00:43:16,320 --> 00:43:19,360
And besides, it's not safe
to be here at night.

694
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:22,080
It is now, dude bro,
you're the Sharkslayer!

695
00:43:22,120 --> 00:43:27,520
- Sharkslayer?
- Sometimes I'd be coughing like that.

696
00:43:27,560 --> 00:43:29,240
Look, I just need you off of these streets.

697
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:30,560
- Come on!
- Get your butts home!

698
00:43:30,600 --> 00:43:32,800
Cause I know your moms,
and I'm just tell them you are doing bad.

699
00:43:32,840 --> 00:43:36,840
- Hey let's go make mister Sykes puff up!
- Yeah! Bye Oscar!

700
00:43:38,280 --> 00:43:44,120
- Lenny! Did you see what just hapened there?
- I know. They think you're the Sharkslayer!

701
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:45,480
As if!

702
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:51,200
- I appreciate your funky tone, actually.
- No, wait up! Hey! I'm sorry.

703
00:43:51,240 --> 00:43:53,240
Seriously, I don't want you mad at me.

704
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:56,520
And I certainly don't want you to 'slay me'!

705
00:43:57,480 --> 00:43:58,760
You're having a good time, right?

706
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:00,120
Are you enjoying yourself?

707
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:03,120
Well, for your information,

708
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:05,040
I am the Sharkslayer!

709
00:44:05,080 --> 00:44:08,160
Oscar the Sharkslayer,
that's what they're saying!

710
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,720
- Wait, you mean you?
- Yeah.

711
00:44:12,360 --> 00:44:13,960
When the anchor...

712
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:19,560
- Oh, you're a liar!
- Hey, I didn't lie, all right?

713
00:44:20,360 --> 00:44:21,480
Allright, I lied!

714
00:44:22,080 --> 00:44:24,560
But that was a little lie! Come on,
no one's was gonna be hurt anyway!

715
00:44:25,240 --> 00:44:26,840
What am I doing? I'm not
gonna explain myself to you.

716
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:29,000
- You know what? You're on your own!
- No problem!

717
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:33,440
And if god forbids, someone should, I don't know.

718
00:44:34,120 --> 00:44:37,720
Find out the truth about the
Sharkslayer on my way back...

719
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:39,880
- You wouldn't!
- I would.

720
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:46,240
Come here!

721
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:50,160
Of course you can cup on me!

722
00:44:51,080 --> 00:44:53,400
But you know, I mean, you're a shark, right?

723
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:56,320
And I'm a Sharkslayer,
so we can't be seen together.

724
00:44:57,120 --> 00:45:02,000
- You dig dug?
- Dig dug, dug dig. Dig dug, yeah!

725
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:04,480
- Yo, diggy dug!
- Just come on!

726
00:45:08,600 --> 00:45:12,080
Okay Lenny, follow my every
move and don't make a sound.

727
00:45:12,120 --> 00:45:16,360
You got it. Wow, echo. Echo!

728
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:18,160
Now, coming for the
south side sharks, I'm fifty.

729
00:45:18,200 --> 00:45:20,400
Oh, it's not okay to hit!

730
00:46:03,520 --> 00:46:05,440
- Get your bum in there!
- You think anybody heard that?

731
00:46:09,480 --> 00:46:13,720
- Who is that? Ha? Who's that?
- Yo-hoo! Crazy Joe!

732
00:46:13,760 --> 00:46:17,000
I thought I heard something!
Did you get that shark?

733
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:22,880
- You have no idea, Joe!
- That's great! Well, gotta go, my show's on!

734
00:46:29,080 --> 00:46:32,160
All right. We're safe. For now.

735
00:46:33,960 --> 00:46:39,040
Hey a bed! Oh! Yeah,
that's good. That's heaven.

736
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:42,280
Snuggely buggley waggely!

737
00:46:43,840 --> 00:46:47,240
- I love you man!
- Wow, hold on!

738
00:46:48,080 --> 00:46:52,920
- You're my new best friend!
- Stop it! Okay, you wanna be friends?

739
00:46:52,960 --> 00:46:55,800
Fine, but we gotta lay down some rules.

740
00:46:56,480 --> 00:47:00,960
Rule number one, no snuggely buggely,

741
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:03,800
whatever that just was!
- You got it. Anything else?

742
00:47:03,840 --> 00:47:07,200
Allright, rule number two!
And this is the most important rule.

743
00:47:07,240 --> 00:47:10,160
Any event, that possibly,
you know, you're hungry...

744
00:47:10,200 --> 00:47:12,160
Don't worry, I'm not gonna eat anyone.

745
00:47:12,200 --> 00:47:15,240
In case you haven't noticed,
I'm different from the other sharks.

746
00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:18,560
Let's put it that way,
leave it at that. Good night!

747
00:47:18,600 --> 00:47:20,200
- Define different.
- You'll laugh.

748
00:47:20,240 --> 00:47:22,800
- I'm not gonna laugh!
- Well that's just what you said,

749
00:47:22,840 --> 00:47:24,600
and then what happens later? You laugh.

750
00:47:24,640 --> 00:47:26,320
Lenny, I give you my word.

751
00:47:27,800 --> 00:47:30,920
Okay, I will tell you, I'm...

752
00:47:31,800 --> 00:47:33,480
I'm a vegetarian.

753
00:47:38,560 --> 00:47:39,880
Hm, hold on.

754
00:47:43,080 --> 00:47:44,000
So that's it?

755
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:46,440
- What do you mean that's it?
- I'm just...

756
00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:47,880
You're first fish I've ever told!

757
00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:50,720
I'm so tired of keeping that all a secret!

758
00:47:50,760 --> 00:47:52,360
- And my dad,
- Wow, hey!

759
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:54,000
he'll never accept me for who I am.

760
00:47:54,040 --> 00:47:58,560
- What's wrong with me?
- Nothing is wrong with you, man.

761
00:47:58,600 --> 00:48:03,920
- I think all sharks should be like you.
- God, that sweet to say.

762
00:48:03,960 --> 00:48:06,880
And stop blaming yourself for what happened.

763
00:48:06,920 --> 00:48:08,800
- Really?
- If you wanna blame anybody,

764
00:48:08,840 --> 00:48:10,880
blame me. Cause if I hadn't been out there,

765
00:48:10,920 --> 00:48:13,780
in the first place, nothing of this would happen!

766
00:48:13,815 --> 00:48:16,640
Yeah, if pop knew that,
he'd ice you for sure.

767
00:48:18,560 --> 00:48:21,320
Ice? Was that a godfather or something?

768
00:48:21,360 --> 00:48:23,640
- Yeah.
- What do you mean, 'yeah'?

769
00:48:23,680 --> 00:48:24,600
Yeah, he is.

770
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:28,840
Hey, are you all right?

771
00:48:33,240 --> 00:48:33,800
GAME OVER

772
00:48:34,760 --> 00:48:36,760
- Ha, man, I told you!
- I'm doing this!

773
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:39,640
Left circle double left square right
to the down square square.

774
00:48:39,675 --> 00:48:41,960
Another square! Respect.
- Respect.

775
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:43,480
Oh yeah? Well I got some news for you!

776
00:48:43,520 --> 00:48:45,680
The Sharkslayer made me
his manager, so I'm now...

777
00:48:45,720 --> 00:48:48,960
what I like to call untouchable!
Did you hear me?

778
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:49,880
- Sykes!
- Okay.

779
00:48:49,920 --> 00:48:50,720
Hey Oscar!

780
00:48:53,040 --> 00:48:55,800
- Sykes!
- Hey hey hey, there he is,

781
00:48:55,840 --> 00:48:58,720
my brother, my player, the Sharkslayer!
- Yeah whatever, Sykes listen.

782
00:48:58,760 --> 00:49:01,760
And another thing, from now on you're gonna
have to start paying me for protection!

783
00:49:01,800 --> 00:49:05,800
Sykes, the deal is off, the shark
I killed was Don Lino's son!

784
00:49:05,840 --> 00:49:08,560
- I know! Any grade?
- Not if he finds out!

785
00:49:08,600 --> 00:49:10,520
What do you mean find out? I've got
him on the phone right now!

786
00:49:10,560 --> 00:49:13,520
That's right, Lino. I've got the
Sharkslayer right here in front of me!

787
00:49:15,320 --> 00:49:20,600
- And he's gonna slay you and all of your sharks!
- Sykes, shut up! Shut up!

788
00:49:20,640 --> 00:49:22,400
Hey that's good. That's good, I like that.

789
00:49:22,440 --> 00:49:24,800
Shut up, Lino! Shut up!

790
00:49:25,560 --> 00:49:28,680
- What? Oh, kid, he wants to talk to you.
- I know, I'm not here! I'm not here!

791
00:49:28,720 --> 00:49:29,480
Yeah, he's right here.

792
00:49:31,080 --> 00:49:33,840
- Hello.
- Shut up? Shut up?

793
00:49:33,880 --> 00:49:36,480
You don't tell me shut up,
I tell you shut up!

794
00:49:36,520 --> 00:49:38,440
- What? Hello?
- Yeah, how you're doing?

795
00:49:38,480 --> 00:49:41,960
Let me have a pie with everything on it.
Anchovies, meet balls, mushrooms...

796
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:43,160
- Luca!
- Oh, hi boss!

797
00:49:43,200 --> 00:49:46,760
- What are you doing working in a pizza joint?
- Get off the phone!

798
00:49:46,800 --> 00:49:47,680
But I'm hungry!

799
00:49:48,480 --> 00:49:51,280
My guys are coming for you, Sharkslayer!

800
00:49:51,320 --> 00:49:54,000
They are going to tear you fin from fin!

801
00:49:54,920 --> 00:49:57,080
Come on, now who's your puff daddy?

802
00:49:57,120 --> 00:49:57,960
Who takes care of you?

803
00:49:58,720 --> 00:50:00,240
Come on you two, we've got work to do.

804
00:50:01,200 --> 00:50:03,800
- I was winning!
- Sykes, Sykes, hold, look!

805
00:50:03,840 --> 00:50:06,080
- You got it all wrong!
- I've been writing songs about you kid!

806
00:50:06,720 --> 00:50:08,680
- All the shark bites..
- Sykes.

807
00:50:08,720 --> 00:50:10,040
With his teeth dear.

808
00:50:10,640 --> 00:50:12,680
- And then Oscar,
- Sykes!

809
00:50:12,720 --> 00:50:14,720
- Kicked his butt!
- Sykes, Sykes, man!

810
00:50:15,360 --> 00:50:17,520
- Come on!
- Maybe I can help?

811
00:50:18,160 --> 00:50:21,680
Hey! Lola! What are you doing here?

812
00:50:21,720 --> 00:50:24,120
You pop it up sometimes in places!

813
00:50:24,160 --> 00:50:26,120
Oh you said to wait, so...

814
00:50:27,680 --> 00:50:32,440
- I've been waiting.
- Look, I don't have a lot of time

815
00:50:32,480 --> 00:50:35,360
for a whole hand clappy making the life's go on

816
00:50:35,400 --> 00:50:37,360
music playing and the guitar thing, you know.

817
00:50:37,400 --> 00:50:41,480
- What are you afraid of?
- Afraid? That's funny.

818
00:50:41,520 --> 00:50:43,360
I'm not afraid of nothing, it's just...

819
00:50:44,120 --> 00:50:48,480
- Oh baby, you're so tense.
- Yeah, you know. I've really been stressed lately,

820
00:50:49,280 --> 00:50:51,840
like protecting the reef,
you know, I do that for myself.

821
00:50:53,360 --> 00:50:56,400
- It's just too crazy.
- It's just too much.

822
00:50:56,440 --> 00:50:58,680
Yeah, you know, just one
thing on top of the other.

823
00:50:59,280 --> 00:51:01,200
Actually I was thinking about retiring.

824
00:51:02,080 --> 00:51:04,220
- You don't wanna do that.
- I don't?

825
00:51:04,255 --> 00:51:06,360
You have worked your way to the top.

826
00:51:07,040 --> 00:51:10,600
You don't wanna go back
to the bottom, do you?

827
00:51:10,640 --> 00:51:17,720
- No. No, no way!
- You just show them who's boss.

828
00:51:17,760 --> 00:51:20,240
And the sharks will leave you alone.

829
00:51:20,960 --> 00:51:23,320
Yeah, you're right!
Lenny!

830
00:51:31,320 --> 00:51:36,520
- Pss! Lenny! Where are you?
- Hello, Oscar.

831
00:51:37,240 --> 00:51:41,360
Angie! Hey! What are you doing here?

832
00:51:41,400 --> 00:51:43,080
What Oscar, did you forget something?

833
00:51:43,115 --> 00:51:47,160
Oh maybe, you forgot your shark!

834
00:51:49,400 --> 00:51:50,160
Hi.

835
00:51:50,920 --> 00:51:54,520
Shark! Swim Angie! I'll cover you! Quick!

836
00:51:54,560 --> 00:52:00,160
- Before it's too late! Go home without me!
- Oh stop it! Your friend shark here told me everything.

837
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:05,000
- Lenny, why would you do that?
- I don't know, I like her!

838
00:52:05,040 --> 00:52:06,920
Thank you, I like you too.

839
00:52:06,960 --> 00:52:09,800
What were you thinking bringing him in here?

840
00:52:09,840 --> 00:52:14,240
- No, I just, I'm still working at the cakes.
- Cakes? You lie!

841
00:52:14,280 --> 00:52:18,040
- Everybody thinks you're slayer of the sharks!
- Who am I gonna tell that they are wrong?

842
00:52:18,080 --> 00:52:23,000
- How could you lie to me, Oscar? Me?
- Don't take it personally. Come on, I lied to everybody!

843
00:52:23,760 --> 00:52:27,640
All right. Look, I'm sorry. I totally betrayed you,

844
00:52:27,680 --> 00:52:29,440
but listen I got just one...

845
00:52:30,120 --> 00:52:32,200
little problem I gotta take care of.
- Of what's that?

846
00:52:32,240 --> 00:52:37,200
- Sharks are coming to get me!
- And they should!

847
00:52:37,240 --> 00:52:39,960
I mean, what did you expect?
You just take credit for killing the shark

848
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:42,840
and everything will be fine and
dandy for the rest of your life?

849
00:52:45,920 --> 00:52:46,840
Yeah!

850
00:52:47,880 --> 00:52:50,800
But don't you worry about it.
Me and Lenny got it,

851
00:52:50,840 --> 00:52:52,440
we go fix it!
- Wow, wow, wow.

852
00:52:52,480 --> 00:52:57,040
- What's with the 'we', I don't wanna 'we' part of this.
- Hey, too late now, vagie boy, they'll be looking for you too.

853
00:52:57,680 --> 00:53:00,760
- Point taken. What's the plan?
- Allright, just what we will do.

854
00:53:00,800 --> 00:53:05,560
Oscar! Here's the plan! You tell
the truth. And you go home!

855
00:53:10,240 --> 00:53:11,920
Allright, look. This we're gonna do, right?

856
00:53:12,680 --> 00:53:15,160
We will paint you up all bloody. Just mess, right?

857
00:53:15,200 --> 00:53:18,600
And you go swim out and meet
the sharks before they get here.

858
00:53:18,640 --> 00:53:19,640
And you will say stop!

859
00:53:20,920 --> 00:53:24,880
Don't go no further! This Sharkslayer's crazy man!

860
00:53:25,560 --> 00:53:28,800
He beat me senceless!
He's stone cold killer, man!

861
00:53:28,840 --> 00:53:30,560
And then you can tell them I'm huge!

862
00:53:30,600 --> 00:53:32,085
You know, tell them that I'm handsome.

863
00:53:32,120 --> 00:53:39,000
- You're going way too far, Oscar!
- Acually he hasn't gone far enough.

864
00:53:39,040 --> 00:53:40,800
Exactly!
What?

865
00:53:41,560 --> 00:53:45,440
You need slay a shark,
and I need to dissappear.

866
00:53:46,120 --> 00:53:47,360
This is what we're gonna do.

867
00:53:50,160 --> 00:53:51,880
This is Katie Current, reporting live.

868
00:53:51,920 --> 00:53:53,560
We've got uncontrolled reports of...

869
00:53:53,600 --> 00:53:54,760
Shark!

870
00:54:03,920 --> 00:54:05,560
Look, it's the Sharkslayer!

871
00:54:26,680 --> 00:54:28,760
Holy microbe! Did we get that?

872
00:54:28,800 --> 00:54:30,560
Hey, Ange! Oscar's on the TV!

873
00:54:31,840 --> 00:54:33,920
Show me that. Allright,
do what you do best.

874
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:39,800
Do you hear them, Lenny?
They are going crazy, man!

875
00:54:39,840 --> 00:54:42,040
- They love us!
- They love you, they hate me!

876
00:54:42,080 --> 00:54:43,400
- What?
- Let's switch sides,

877
00:54:43,440 --> 00:54:44,880
maybe I can be the Fishslayer!

878
00:54:44,920 --> 00:54:47,120
- They'll never see it coming!
- Come on, man!

879
00:54:47,160 --> 00:54:50,040
You saw this, you'll never
have to go home again!

880
00:54:50,080 --> 00:54:51,600
You can start a new life!

881
00:54:51,640 --> 00:54:53,560
- Now give me a growl!
- Okay.

882
00:55:03,640 --> 00:55:07,120
- Like that?
- That was pretty good.

883
00:55:07,160 --> 00:55:08,240
Let's go!

884
00:55:11,200 --> 00:55:12,600
Is that what you're offering?
Do you understand how huge

885
00:55:12,640 --> 00:55:14,640
my client is? Turn on your TV right now!

886
00:55:17,520 --> 00:55:19,680
Lenny, hold on! Lenny, Lenny!

887
00:55:23,360 --> 00:55:24,760
Turn off your TV! Turn off your TV!

888
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:32,520
- Don't swallow!
- Oscar?

889
00:55:32,560 --> 00:55:36,520
No, it's Pinnoccio. Of course it's me!
Why did you do that?

890
00:55:36,560 --> 00:55:39,080
- I'm sorry.
- No, no. Sorry, is when you step

891
00:55:39,120 --> 00:55:40,720
on somebody's fin at the movie theater.

892
00:55:40,760 --> 00:55:42,760
It is sorry. Sorry, is what you say,

893
00:55:42,800 --> 00:55:44,280
Hey, where's the baby, dude?

894
00:55:44,320 --> 00:55:45,845
And it turns out to burst is just fat!

895
00:55:45,880 --> 00:55:50,520
This is as far away from sorry,
as you could possibly get!

896
00:55:50,560 --> 00:55:56,520
- But Oscar! I think I'm gonna puke.
- No, no, no! Lenny, just open up.

897
00:55:56,560 --> 00:55:58,640
Nice and easy.

898
00:56:09,240 --> 00:56:12,560
- Are you not entertained?
- Go Oscar, man!

899
00:56:12,600 --> 00:56:15,760
- You can't handle its rule!
- Go get them!

900
00:56:15,800 --> 00:56:18,080
You had me at hello!

901
00:56:19,720 --> 00:56:21,840
Turn your TV back on! What are you doing,

902
00:56:21,880 --> 00:56:23,040
turning your TV off? Turn it on!

903
00:56:41,200 --> 00:56:44,120
This reef is huge. How we're supposed
to find the Sharkslayer?

904
00:56:56,120 --> 00:56:58,960
This is it, Lenny. Big finish!
Just like we practised.

905
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:01,200
- The flying fish?
- The flying fish!

906
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:06,040
Little more help here, body boy!

907
00:57:06,680 --> 00:57:08,720
- Sorry.
- Thank you.

908
00:57:29,280 --> 00:57:32,600
Curse you, Sharkslayer!

909
00:57:48,240 --> 00:57:51,920
Yeah, and you tell Don Lino,

910
00:57:52,440 --> 00:57:56,560
that I don't never ever ever ever never!
Want to see another shark

911
00:57:56,600 --> 00:57:59,360
on this reef again!
- Ever!

912
00:58:00,920 --> 00:58:02,880
Remember this name,

913
00:58:02,920 --> 00:58:05,640
Oscar the Sharkslayer!

914
00:58:06,280 --> 00:58:08,120
Aha! You see? You see? Ha?

915
00:58:16,720 --> 00:58:18,800
Look at Oscar! Oscar!

916
00:58:22,680 --> 00:58:23,560
Hey, Lol...

917
00:58:24,880 --> 00:58:27,640
It seems that Sharkslayer not only
countered a few sharks today,

918
00:58:27,680 --> 00:58:31,560
but maybe a few hearts?
Has the reef's most eligible

919
00:58:31,600 --> 00:58:32,920
bachelor have been snapped up?

920
00:58:32,960 --> 00:58:37,360
I'm Katie Current. You're live watching
the Sharkslayer making out.

921
00:58:39,320 --> 00:58:41,800
Hey Angie, can you hand me the blue one?

922
00:58:43,400 --> 00:58:44,480
Thank you.

923
00:58:45,840 --> 00:58:48,160
Who steps in the room?

924
00:58:50,280 --> 00:58:51,520
- Yeah!
- Oscar and Lenny!

925
00:58:51,560 --> 00:58:53,640
What a dream baby! Give me that!
Give me some fin!

926
00:58:53,840 --> 00:58:54,520
- High fin!
- Give me some fin!

927
00:58:54,760 --> 00:58:57,280
- Low fin!
- Did you see me? I was like...

928
00:58:59,920 --> 00:59:02,920
- That was great!
- When you punched me, the crowd was...

929
00:59:04,080 --> 00:59:05,840
Yeah, the ate it up! Hey Angie, Angie

930
00:59:05,880 --> 00:59:07,520
you ain't know how Lenny had me in him, did you?

931
00:59:07,560 --> 00:59:09,960
- It was like an Oscar explosion!
- How good was I?

932
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:12,280
- Oh you was the ball!
- Thank you, thank you.

933
00:59:12,960 --> 00:59:16,040
Hey, hey, hey! Casanova!

934
00:59:16,080 --> 00:59:20,480
I saw your big finish on the news.
Nice smooch, lover boy.

935
00:59:22,600 --> 00:59:23,760
It was just private, just private.

936
00:59:23,800 --> 00:59:28,560
- Private! The entire reef saw you do it.
- Hey, somebody's got a bad move.

937
00:59:28,600 --> 00:59:29,880
Come on, Ange. Let me see the smile!

938
00:59:29,920 --> 00:59:31,560
- Show me the smile, baby!
- Knock it off!

939
00:59:32,480 --> 00:59:36,480
- What is gotten in you?
- Me? I want, I swear! Sometimes I wanna

940
00:59:36,520 --> 00:59:39,200
take your big dumb dummy head and just...

941
00:59:40,840 --> 00:59:44,360
- Ange, Ange, what is the problem?
- Problem? There's no problem, I'm not having problem!

942
00:59:44,880 --> 00:59:46,560
Maybe it's probably because
you're the one with a problem!

943
00:59:46,600 --> 00:59:49,280
- Hey you guys?
- What have you got against Lola?

944
00:59:49,320 --> 00:59:51,680
Not my lips, that's for sure!

945
00:59:52,360 --> 00:59:55,160
- Okay, what's going on?
- I'm gonna stay out of this.

946
00:59:55,200 --> 00:59:57,560
Look, why would you even
care about Lola anyway?

947
00:59:57,600 --> 00:59:58,720
- I don't!
- You don't?

948
00:59:58,760 --> 00:59:59,760
- No!
- No what?

949
00:59:59,800 --> 01:00:02,040
- I don't know!
- You guys, you wanna get?

950
01:00:02,080 --> 01:00:03,000
- No
- No!

951
01:00:03,040 --> 01:00:05,240
Just tell me, Oscar, cause I'm curious.

952
01:00:05,960 --> 01:00:09,640
Why do you think she's interested?
Do you think for one minute

953
01:00:09,680 --> 01:00:13,040
that she would even be with you,
if you want to reach a fame of Sharkslayer?

954
01:00:13,080 --> 01:00:15,160
- Come on guys, please don't fight.
- Are you that light?

955
01:00:15,200 --> 01:00:18,960
- At least she treats me like I'm somebody!
- Yeah, but will she love you if you were nobody?

956
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:21,680
- Nobody loved me when I was nobody!
- I did!

957
01:00:25,720 --> 01:00:28,600
Before the money, and before the fame,

958
01:00:29,440 --> 01:00:34,920
before the lie! To me you were a somebody, Oscar.

959
01:00:34,960 --> 01:00:40,040
Now you're nothing! But a fake. A shame.

960
01:00:40,800 --> 01:00:44,040
- You're joker.
- Here I come!

961
01:00:46,160 --> 01:00:49,720
Sebastian, the way you'll washing dolphin!

962
01:00:58,760 --> 01:01:02,000
- Angie.
- No, forget it! Just go!

963
01:01:02,760 --> 01:01:06,320
Cause I'm tired of hearing that everything
you had in your life wasn't good enough.

964
01:01:07,040 --> 01:01:08,360
Including me.

965
01:01:17,440 --> 01:01:20,680
- Angie?
- Oh honey, I'm sorry.

966
01:01:21,880 --> 01:01:23,440
Go back and do it again.

967
01:01:26,840 --> 01:01:31,360
Hey, come on. It'll be okay.

968
01:01:57,600 --> 01:02:01,520
You can't have the lose!
You got shark breath!

969
01:02:02,800 --> 01:02:03,440
'O' mints

970
01:02:12,160 --> 01:02:15,280
'Coca cola'
'Get real'

971
01:02:25,840 --> 01:02:28,080
What are you kids doing?
How many times I got to tell you?

972
01:02:29,320 --> 01:02:31,800
This is past your bed time! Go on, all right.

973
01:02:33,600 --> 01:02:35,440
Hey, hey, hey! What are you kids are...

974
01:02:36,520 --> 01:02:39,200
Well, it looks pretty good!
You guys should do this for a living!

975
01:03:09,040 --> 01:03:10,440
Preparation 'O'!

976
01:03:11,040 --> 01:03:14,600
It slays hemorroids like Oscar slays sharks!

977
01:03:15,320 --> 01:03:16,840
Hey Oscar!

978
01:03:22,040 --> 01:03:25,120
Angie was right. I am a joker.

979
01:03:26,240 --> 01:03:30,280
Hey, Sharkslayer. Why are you in here?

980
01:03:30,320 --> 01:03:34,480
- All your friens are inside!
- Not all my friends.

981
01:03:34,520 --> 01:03:37,200
You may not little bottom feeder
from the whale wash.

982
01:03:37,920 --> 01:03:41,240
Forget about her. She's a nobody.

983
01:03:42,080 --> 01:03:43,440
I'm the nobody.

984
01:03:45,880 --> 01:03:49,280
Oh let me guess. She told you that she loves you,

985
01:03:49,320 --> 01:03:50,640
is that it?

986
01:03:53,800 --> 01:03:55,520
It's not like you feel the same way about her.

987
01:04:04,840 --> 01:04:06,840
You know what? I don't think
this is gonna work out.

988
01:04:06,880 --> 01:04:09,960
What? Are you dumping me?

989
01:04:14,520 --> 01:04:16,160
Let me explain something to you.

990
01:04:16,200 --> 01:04:18,280
We get party like at your birthday.

991
01:04:21,800 --> 01:04:23,000
Ha! Young love!

992
01:04:28,160 --> 01:04:29,200
CHOCOLATES

993
01:04:30,160 --> 01:04:31,200
FLOWERS

994
01:04:44,320 --> 01:04:46,600
- Hey Oscar!
- Hey, I can't talk, I gotta find Angie!

995
01:04:47,160 --> 01:04:49,280
I need to tell her... I love her!

996
01:04:52,200 --> 01:04:53,845
Where you're going, Oscar?

997
01:04:53,880 --> 01:04:56,280
- Hi, whale wash.
- Give me the phone!

998
01:04:56,320 --> 01:05:00,160
- We'll you got a whale to wash and the price...
- Give me back the phone! And the price is...

999
01:05:00,720 --> 01:05:05,040
very very low. Consider no good washers!
- Good one, Ernie.

1000
01:05:05,080 --> 01:05:07,160
How many times do I have to tell you? It's gosh!

1001
01:05:07,200 --> 01:05:09,920
You get a whale of a wash,
and the price - oh my gosh!

1002
01:05:09,960 --> 01:05:11,880
- All right, we get it man.
- Whale wash,

1003
01:05:11,920 --> 01:05:14,760
rhymes with gush!
- Give me that!

1004
01:05:14,800 --> 01:05:17,320
Get out of here, both of you.
Won't you use some place else, will you?

1005
01:05:17,360 --> 01:05:19,320
- Sykes? Where's Angie?
- You tell me!

1006
01:05:19,360 --> 01:05:21,520
Whale wash, you got a whale of a wash... No?

1007
01:05:22,280 --> 01:05:23,640
- It's for you.
- Ha?

1008
01:05:24,600 --> 01:05:26,560
- Hello?
- Is this the Sharkslayer?

1009
01:05:26,600 --> 01:05:29,360
- Yeah, who is this?
- It's Luca the octop... I mean,

1010
01:05:29,400 --> 01:05:33,440
forget about it. Now you follow
these instructions, okay?

1011
01:05:33,480 --> 01:05:37,080
Fall cabinet, top drawer,
there's a package. Get it.

1012
01:05:38,960 --> 01:05:41,360
That's right, tough guy,
we got your girl.

1013
01:05:42,360 --> 01:05:44,680
That is gonna be a sit-down. In one hour.

1014
01:05:44,720 --> 01:05:46,080
- Who is it?
- Shh!

1015
01:05:46,680 --> 01:05:50,040
Be there if you don't want
to see her sleeping with the fishes.

1016
01:05:51,520 --> 01:05:52,600
The bad ones.

1017
01:05:53,480 --> 01:05:55,480
Now nod your head if you understand.

1018
01:05:58,320 --> 01:05:59,960
Now tell me if you nodded your head.

1019
01:06:01,400 --> 01:06:02,000
I nodded.

1020
01:06:04,880 --> 01:06:07,280
They got Angie. And they want a sit-down.

1021
01:06:08,120 --> 01:06:09,920
I never meant for anybody to get hurt,

1022
01:06:09,960 --> 01:06:13,440
especially not Angie. This is all my fault.

1023
01:06:13,480 --> 01:06:15,760
That's a classic move. I've
seen it a thousand times.

1024
01:06:15,800 --> 01:06:18,960
They take the thing you love the most,
and then they use it against you!

1025
01:06:22,480 --> 01:06:25,720
Look, we gotta go to that sit-down,
and we gotta save her.

1026
01:06:25,755 --> 01:06:28,000
Wow, wow, wow. Look,
I wanna save Angie too,

1027
01:06:28,040 --> 01:06:29,560
but I can't just sit there and say,

1028
01:06:29,600 --> 01:06:31,600
- Hi pap, I'm a dolphin!
- Lenny?

1029
01:06:31,640 --> 01:06:33,320
And my friend Sharkslayer, he is a fake!

1030
01:06:33,360 --> 01:06:34,440
- Fake?
- Come on!

1031
01:06:34,480 --> 01:06:35,880
We're gonna need
a better plan than that.

1032
01:06:37,640 --> 01:06:39,200
This is a joke, right? This is a joke?

1033
01:06:39,240 --> 01:06:40,480
Because you know, I told Lino,

1034
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:42,720
Shut up, Lino! Shut up!

1035
01:06:44,840 --> 01:06:45,965
Tell me you didn't make it a low kid.

1036
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:48,240
Tell me that's not Lenny. Tell
me you're a real Sharkslayer.

1037
01:06:48,280 --> 01:06:50,440
- Please!
- I'm sorry, Sykes.

1038
01:06:51,120 --> 01:06:51,800
I'm not.

1039
01:06:53,640 --> 01:06:55,920
But the sharks don't know that.

1040
01:07:23,400 --> 01:07:25,800
Would you stop screwing around? This will
never work. We're dead, we're dead!

1041
01:07:25,840 --> 01:07:28,480
Sh! Thank you, Sykes. Thank you!

1042
01:07:29,200 --> 01:07:33,160
My man Sykes has just begged me

1043
01:07:33,200 --> 01:07:36,160
not to murder you all up here, right?

1044
01:07:36,200 --> 01:07:39,320
Now I might listen to him.
But then I cannot might not.

1045
01:07:39,360 --> 01:07:42,280
And that depends on the individual behaviour

1046
01:07:42,320 --> 01:07:46,120
of all the individuals in here. Individuals.

1047
01:07:46,160 --> 01:07:47,320
Hey, is that right?

1048
01:07:47,360 --> 01:07:52,840
- Look, he's got dolphine muscle.
- My uncle Will got wacked by one of those.

1049
01:07:52,880 --> 01:07:56,120
All right. Which one of you sorry
deans caled this meeting?

1050
01:07:56,160 --> 01:07:58,280
That would be me.

1051
01:08:00,320 --> 01:08:04,760
So, this the Sharkslayer? I've been
looking forward to meet you.

1052
01:08:04,800 --> 01:08:08,760
I feel like we're practically family!
You know that's funny, ain't it?

1053
01:08:08,800 --> 01:08:13,000
I brought my kids into the
world. Full love and care.

1054
01:08:13,760 --> 01:08:17,040
And you took them out.
You know who I am?

1055
01:08:17,800 --> 01:08:19,200
Do you know who I am?

1056
01:08:19,960 --> 01:08:24,160
I'm the Don! The boss of the Great White sharks!

1057
01:08:24,200 --> 01:08:26,000
Hey boss, I saved your seat.

1058
01:08:27,040 --> 01:08:29,840
I've been running this reef
since before you was born!

1059
01:08:29,880 --> 01:08:32,480
And If you thought that guy like me,

1060
01:08:32,520 --> 01:08:35,280
can't get to a guy like you, guess what?

1061
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:37,560
You thought wrong!

1062
01:08:42,320 --> 01:08:45,360
Man, you're the one who's wrong.
I barely know that girl.

1063
01:08:45,400 --> 01:08:48,480
- What her name was?
- Oh yeah?

1064
01:08:49,240 --> 01:08:50,800
Well I say he's bluffing.

1065
01:08:52,560 --> 01:08:56,600
- If I wasn't marry.
- How you're doing, pretty lady?

1066
01:08:57,480 --> 01:09:02,760
- Lola! We meet again!
- You know, Sharkslayer,

1067
01:09:02,800 --> 01:09:06,280
there's only one thing
I like better than money...

1068
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:08,080
Revenge!

1069
01:09:09,320 --> 01:09:12,800
- Oh, I'm in love!
- Your shark slaying days are over!

1070
01:09:13,480 --> 01:09:15,840
and there ain't nothing you can do about it.

1071
01:09:31,080 --> 01:09:32,080
Ha? What's so funny?

1072
01:09:32,800 --> 01:09:35,560
You got nothing! Nothing!

1073
01:09:35,600 --> 01:09:37,640
Sebastian, take a roll!

1074
01:09:45,440 --> 01:09:46,040
Can't touch this!

1075
01:09:48,520 --> 01:09:49,200
Can't touch this!

1076
01:09:51,560 --> 01:09:53,760
Stop! Oscar time!
Okay!

1077
01:09:54,480 --> 01:09:56,440
New rules! Nobody!

1078
01:09:56,480 --> 01:09:59,680
I repeat, nobody makes
a move without my okay.

1079
01:09:59,720 --> 01:10:01,960
I am the pattern marker now baby!

1080
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:05,040
From now on everything flows through me!

1081
01:10:05,080 --> 01:10:06,960
What did he do? What did he do? I can't see it!

1082
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:10,000
You don't lose a two, you don't
grow one back without my okay.

1083
01:10:10,040 --> 01:10:11,765
- Okay?
- Okay.

1084
01:10:11,800 --> 01:10:15,480
If you sneeze, you don't white
dead boogie without my okay.

1085
01:10:15,520 --> 01:10:16,760
- Okay?
- Okay.

1086
01:10:16,800 --> 01:10:19,360
All right. And you don't say okay, without my okay.

1087
01:10:19,400 --> 01:10:20,480
Okay?

1088
01:10:22,600 --> 01:10:25,440
Okay! Thank you all for coming,
good meeting, we gotta go.

1089
01:10:25,480 --> 01:10:29,320
And one more thing. What is with
all your living in a low boo?

1090
01:10:29,360 --> 01:10:31,240
- Oscar!
- That was supposed to be my

1091
01:10:31,280 --> 01:10:34,920
get yourselves a real high-down!
- Oscar.

1092
01:10:34,960 --> 01:10:37,680
And take the good look, Lino. It's over!

1093
01:10:37,720 --> 01:10:40,480
- Your old school!
- Oscar!

1094
01:10:40,520 --> 01:10:41,360
What?

1095
01:10:52,920 --> 01:10:54,560
Excuse me.

1096
01:10:54,600 --> 01:10:57,960
- Ange, are you okay?
- No! I am not okay!

1097
01:10:57,995 --> 01:11:00,840
- He ate me!
- I had to take it.

1098
01:11:00,880 --> 01:11:03,640
- The taste was killing me!
- Lenny?

1099
01:11:05,040 --> 01:11:06,280
Is that you?

1100
01:11:09,680 --> 01:11:12,480
You're alive?
I thought I lost you!

1101
01:11:14,160 --> 01:11:15,480
What are you wearing, ha?

1102
01:11:15,520 --> 01:11:16,520
What is that?

1103
01:11:33,120 --> 01:11:34,520
Hey boss, it's Lenny!

1104
01:11:34,560 --> 01:11:37,160
He was wearing the disguise,
so we wouldn't recognize him.

1105
01:11:37,200 --> 01:11:39,040
But now he's not wearing a disguise,

1106
01:11:39,080 --> 01:11:41,400
so we do recognize him!

1107
01:11:42,480 --> 01:11:44,440
- Hi pap.
- Are you kidding me?

1108
01:11:45,200 --> 01:11:47,760
Are you kidding me?
Are you out of your mind?

1109
01:11:47,800 --> 01:11:49,760
Do you have any idea how this looks?

1110
01:11:49,800 --> 01:11:52,800
This is the best sit-down,
I've ever been to!

1111
01:11:53,640 --> 01:11:56,120
What are you doing with disguise?
You took out your own flash and blood!

1112
01:11:56,160 --> 01:11:58,200
- Franki!
- Look pap, just listen!

1113
01:11:58,240 --> 01:12:01,480
It's not that, you never take
side against the family, ever!

1114
01:12:01,520 --> 01:12:05,160
Hey Don Lino! Sir, listen!
It's not his fault!

1115
01:12:05,200 --> 01:12:08,320
- This is between you and me.
- What did I ever do to you!

1116
01:12:08,360 --> 01:12:11,960
You took Franki away, and you've
turned Lenny into a dolphin!

1117
01:12:13,080 --> 01:12:14,200
I'm gonna get you!

1118
01:12:14,240 --> 01:12:18,760
- Oscar! Look out!
- Oscar! Swim! Swim for your life!

1119
01:12:26,760 --> 01:12:29,680
You're gonna regret the day
you became the Sharkslayer!

1120
01:12:32,040 --> 01:12:35,120
- Look who's talking in the pot hole!
- Ha?

1121
01:12:35,160 --> 01:12:40,040
You're still hungry big guy!
Well say hello to my little friends!

1122
01:12:53,840 --> 01:12:55,320
- Try again.
- Whale wash.

1123
01:12:55,960 --> 01:12:58,560
You get a whale of a wash
and a price. Oh my gosh!

1124
01:12:58,600 --> 01:13:00,640
All right, you got it right!

1125
01:13:00,680 --> 01:13:03,320
- You got it right.
- Move! Everybody everyway!

1126
01:13:15,960 --> 01:13:18,520
Come on, Lino. It's time
to clean up your act.

1127
01:13:22,760 --> 01:13:24,520
Pap, leave him alone!

1128
01:13:32,360 --> 01:13:34,640
All right Lino! Game's over!

1129
01:13:42,040 --> 01:13:43,920
Lenny? What are you doing in there?

1130
01:13:43,960 --> 01:13:45,680
- Sorry.
- Where's Lino?

1131
01:13:47,120 --> 01:13:49,760
- He's right behind me, isn't he?
- You're mine now!

1132
01:14:02,960 --> 01:14:05,240
- Let's finish the Sharkslayer.
- Oh we're about to!

1133
01:14:34,240 --> 01:14:35,720
Thank you for coming to whale wash.

1134
01:14:39,480 --> 01:14:43,720
Okay! Somebody needs to get me
out of the bubble. Today!

1135
01:14:46,120 --> 01:14:48,240
- Angie?
- The Sharkslayer has done it again!

1136
01:14:48,280 --> 01:14:49,200
- Hey!
- This time...

1137
01:14:49,240 --> 01:14:51,040
- Wait!
- glorying two sharks into his

1138
01:14:51,080 --> 01:14:52,440
death trap of high gene.
- No!

1139
01:14:52,480 --> 01:14:54,965
Oscar, you're the somebody,
everybody wants to be!

1140
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:58,960
The top of the food chain!
Tell our cameras, how it feels to be you.

1141
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:01,240
- Angie?
- Oscar, get me out of here, quick!

1142
01:15:01,280 --> 01:15:04,320
I need to get straight so I get
as far away as I supposed to.

1143
01:15:04,360 --> 01:15:07,120
- Look what you did to him!
- No, it's all a big misunderstanding!

1144
01:15:07,160 --> 01:15:09,160
Sharkslayer, over here! One word
about you, Sharkslayer.

1145
01:15:12,760 --> 01:15:14,880
- Sharkslayer! Sharkslayer!
- Stop!

1146
01:15:15,640 --> 01:15:20,320
I am not a real Sharkslayer!

1147
01:15:27,200 --> 01:15:30,440
- I lied.
- What?

1148
01:15:31,120 --> 01:15:34,320
And I'm not a real financial advisor!

1149
01:15:35,720 --> 01:15:39,720
Okay, it was an anchor that killed Franki.

1150
01:15:40,400 --> 01:15:43,160
I didn't have anything to do
with it and neither did Lenny.

1151
01:15:43,200 --> 01:15:45,800
If that was true, why did you ran away?

1152
01:15:45,840 --> 01:15:48,560
I think you always wanted me to be like Franki.

1153
01:15:49,280 --> 01:15:51,760
I'll never be the shark you want me to be.

1154
01:15:52,480 --> 01:15:54,880
What is your problem?

1155
01:15:54,920 --> 01:15:57,440
So, your son likes calp? So?

1156
01:15:57,480 --> 01:15:59,040
His best friends are fishes. So?

1157
01:15:59,080 --> 01:16:02,760
He likes to dress like a dolphin, so what?!

1158
01:16:03,440 --> 01:16:06,440
Everybody loves him just the way he is.

1159
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:08,840
Why can't you?

1160
01:16:12,440 --> 01:16:13,960
Don't make the same mistake that I did.

1161
01:16:14,800 --> 01:16:18,120
I didn't know what I have. Till I lost her.

1162
01:16:24,600 --> 01:16:27,680
Will you get me out of this?
So I can hug my kid.

1163
01:16:27,720 --> 01:16:30,960
- And tell him I'm sorry.
- Pap!

1164
01:16:37,080 --> 01:16:38,000
Give me a hue.

1165
01:16:40,920 --> 01:16:44,720
I love you son, no matter
what you eat, or how you dress.

1166
01:16:46,400 --> 01:16:49,080
- Oscar?
- Angie?

1167
01:16:55,720 --> 01:16:56,320
Angie...

1168
01:16:58,480 --> 01:17:00,920
I wish I knew now
what I knew then. I mean...

1169
01:17:00,955 --> 01:17:04,280
I wish you knew,
what I knew. I mean...

1170
01:17:04,320 --> 01:17:06,840
- Before this.
- You're blowing it, man!

1171
01:17:06,880 --> 01:17:07,840
Mind your business, all right?

1172
01:17:07,880 --> 01:17:09,760
I'm just emotional,
and there's pressure!

1173
01:17:10,680 --> 01:17:13,120
What I'm saying, I just...

1174
01:17:13,960 --> 01:17:15,880
I didn't mean the top of the reef.

1175
01:17:15,920 --> 01:17:18,960
Everything I wanted was right there in front of me.

1176
01:17:19,800 --> 01:17:20,680
The whole time.

1177
01:17:21,600 --> 01:17:24,000
What about being a somebody?

1178
01:17:24,040 --> 01:17:26,400
I'm nobody without you.

1179
01:17:37,160 --> 01:17:38,200
You're not helping.

1180
01:17:40,680 --> 01:17:44,360
Oh, come here! You big dumb dummy head!

1181
01:17:49,480 --> 01:17:50,840
I've never told you till this, but

1182
01:17:50,880 --> 01:17:53,120
you're the best henchmen
and guides I ever had.

1183
01:17:53,160 --> 01:17:54,600
Come on, group hug!

1184
01:17:54,640 --> 01:17:56,840
- Ah! Hey!
- Sorry man, sorry.

1185
01:17:56,880 --> 01:17:59,080
Come such, straight again
man, don't be afraid.

1186
01:17:59,120 --> 01:18:00,680
Oh forget, the moment's gone.

1187
01:18:02,480 --> 01:18:06,160
So Lino, Don, we're cool, right?

1188
01:18:06,200 --> 01:18:09,120
I mean like the reef is safe,
you know walk the streets,

1189
01:18:09,160 --> 01:18:11,320
you know without... you know?

1190
01:18:11,360 --> 01:18:13,600
Yeah, we're cool.

1191
01:18:16,400 --> 01:18:18,040
Oscar, excuse me, Oscar?

1192
01:18:18,080 --> 01:18:21,440
You've lost everything
you've lied so hard to achieve.

1193
01:18:21,480 --> 01:18:23,200
Tell me, what's next for you?

1194
01:18:25,960 --> 01:18:27,400
Come on! Everyone's waiting!

1195
01:18:28,280 --> 01:18:30,600
- Mister manager!
- Hey, I just gotta put

1196
01:18:30,640 --> 01:18:32,440
the finishing touch on my new desk.

1197
01:18:33,320 --> 01:18:34,200
I love you, pap.

1198
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:36,800
- Yo, dog!
- Sykes!

1199
01:18:36,840 --> 01:18:38,800
All right partner,
let's see what you can do.

1200
01:18:40,520 --> 01:18:45,320
Sykes and Oscar's whale wash
is now opened for business!

1201
01:18:47,080 --> 01:18:51,800
Yo E, B, let's get this party boomed!

1202
01:18:53,040 --> 01:18:55,400
The other wheels of steel!

1203
01:18:56,160 --> 01:18:58,720
Yo Christina! Missy!
How about we have a low?

1204
01:18:58,760 --> 01:19:00,600
Oscar leashes furnal!

1205
01:19:20,720 --> 01:19:22,320
What's up with your bow? Let it go!

1206
01:19:29,720 --> 01:19:32,240
Hey Angie? Sorry papa and I are late,

1207
01:19:32,280 --> 01:19:33,720
but we brought some new customers!

1208
01:19:34,480 --> 01:19:36,880
- Hey, how you're doing?
- Wow!

1209
01:19:36,920 --> 01:19:38,880
Okay, guys! Come on in!

1210
01:19:40,080 --> 01:19:42,600
- Yo, yo, what's up brother?
- Hey Oscar!

1211
01:19:42,840 --> 01:19:43,560
What's up!

1212
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:54,640
No, no snap it, snap it,

1213
01:19:54,680 --> 01:19:58,200
- I'm snapping, I'm snapping!
- It's okay, yo Great Whites can't do it yo!

1214
01:19:58,240 --> 01:19:59,320

1215
01:19:59,360 --> 01:20:01,120

1217
01:20:05,400 --> 01:20:06,080
I'm sorry.

1218
01:20:06,120 --> 01:20:09,440
- Okay dude, I painted you high!
- All right!

1219
01:20:10,320 --> 01:20:13,120
- Paint me out!
- Hey! You think you're smart?

1220
01:20:13,160 --> 01:20:15,240
What am I? A clown?

1221
01:20:19,920 --> 01:20:21,720
Keep going with me,
don't let me lose you!

1222
01:20:21,760 --> 01:20:23,000
Cause I can't lose you!

1223
01:20:26,160 --> 01:20:27,040
In your face!

1224
01:20:29,640 --> 01:20:31,960
- Allright, what you got?
- You don't wanna mess with me!

1225
01:20:32,720 --> 01:20:34,720
Yo-hoo! Break it down, fellows!

This is a Shark Tale exlusive.

01:21:37,160 --> 01:21:38,280
For now and here.
