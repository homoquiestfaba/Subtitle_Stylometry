910
00:49:29,983 --> 00:49:31,130
but these focus solely on the
made

911
00:49:31,165 --> 00:49:33,459
up languages, identical vs.
Fraternal,

912
00:49:33,494 --> 00:49:35,336
male versus female, et cetera.

913
00:49:35,371 --> 00:49:40,688
Now, I threw in "The Dual Voice
Sings" just for fun.

914
00:49:40,722 --> 00:49:44,060
It's a book of songs composed
exclusively by twins.

915
00:49:44,094 --> 00:49:44,998
Fraternal?

916
00:49:45,033 --> 00:49:45,971
Identical.

917
00:49:46,006 --> 00:49:47,223
Oh, I can't wait.

918
00:49:47,257 --> 00:49:48,821
So glad I could help you.

919
00:49:48,855 --> 00:49:49,794
Bye.

920
00:49:53,096 --> 00:49:55,008
Judy says I should take over.

921
00:49:55,043 --> 00:49:55,946
Why?

922
00:49:55,981 --> 00:49:57,893
What does she want Mary to do?

923
00:49:57,927 --> 00:49:58,866
HOWARD: Guess.

924
00:50:01,716 --> 00:50:02,654
This is ridiculous.

925
00:50:07,694 --> 00:50:09,536
Why did you take me off the
desk?

926
00:50:09,572 --> 00:50:12,526
It's so busy, and you're such a
speedy little shelver.

927
00:50:12,560 --> 00:50:14,819
God, don't patronize me, Judy.

928
00:50:14,854 --> 00:50:17,009
Yeah, I know I'm the fastest
shelver here.

929
00:50:17,044 --> 00:50:19,060
But that doesn't mean it's the
only thing I can do.

930
00:50:19,094 --> 00:50:21,111
And don't give me that "you're
only a clerk" rap,

931
00:50:21,145 --> 00:50:22,431
because Wanda's only a clerk.

932
00:50:22,467 --> 00:50:24,690
You've got to do the Scientific
American overhaul.

933
00:50:24,725 --> 00:50:27,402
And you invited her to the
acquisitions conference.

934
00:50:27,436 --> 00:50:28,826
She's always at the desk.

935
00:50:28,861 --> 00:50:30,252
She's always coding.

936
00:50:30,286 --> 00:50:32,615
I haven't coded one single book
since--

937
00:50:32,649 --> 00:50:34,457
Since we had that problem.

938
00:50:34,493 --> 00:50:35,882
It was my first week, Judy!

939
00:50:35,917 --> 00:50:36,890
Shh!

940
00:50:40,922 --> 00:50:41,999
Maybe I do treat you
differently.

941
00:50:42,034 --> 00:50:42,834
OK.

942
00:50:42,868 --> 00:50:44,189
But that's because I'm
concerned.

943
00:50:44,224 --> 00:50:45,162
We're family. - So?

944
00:50:45,198 --> 00:50:47,213
So what? So you knew my mother,
big deal.

945
00:50:47,248 --> 00:50:48,116
So did I.

946
00:50:48,152 --> 00:50:50,411
She was a woman with no common
sense.

947
00:50:50,446 --> 00:50:53,296
Judy, it's no reason to judge
me all the time.

948
00:50:53,330 --> 00:50:54,720
Everybody here sees it. Ask
Howard.

949
00:50:54,754 --> 00:50:55,971
- I-- - Ask Anne.

950
00:50:56,007 --> 00:50:57,397
- Judge-- - Ask Wanda!

951
00:50:57,432 --> 00:50:58,925
- You? - Yes, you do.

952
00:50:58,961 --> 00:50:59,864
Spare me.

953
00:50:59,899 --> 00:51:01,046
You do.

954
00:51:01,081 --> 00:51:02,298
I have eyes.

955
00:51:02,332 --> 00:51:04,209
I know what you think of me. -
No, you don't.

956
00:51:04,244 --> 00:51:05,252
Oh yes, I do.

957
00:51:05,287 --> 00:51:06,712
You do not, Jody.

958
00:51:06,746 --> 00:51:09,040
You try to intimidate me.

959
00:51:09,076 --> 00:51:10,257
Me?

960
00:51:10,291 --> 00:51:12,064
I try to intimidate you?

961
00:51:12,099 --> 00:51:13,975
You're the one who's
intimidating, Judy.

962
00:51:14,011 --> 00:51:15,158
I try to do--

963
00:51:15,192 --> 00:51:16,270
I try to do a good job here.

00:51:16,305 --> 00:51:17,243
Shh!

965
00:51:17,278 --> 00:51:18,251
You don't even see it.

966
00:51:18,286 --> 00:51:19,398
You don't even care!

967
00:51:19,433 --> 00:51:22,387
Of course I care.

968
00:51:22,422 --> 00:51:24,680
But the fact of the matter is, I
have known you

969
00:51:24,716 --> 00:51:26,906
since the day you were born.

970
00:51:26,940 --> 00:51:29,616
And you come here every day, and
I don't

971
00:51:29,651 --> 00:51:32,814
know the first thing about you.

972
00:51:32,848 --> 00:51:35,352
What do you want to know?

973
00:51:35,386 --> 00:51:36,950
Anything.

Your life, your friends.

975
00:51:40,912 --> 00:51:42,650
My friends are people.

976
00:51:42,685 --> 00:51:46,613
They're normal people, just like
your friends, Judy.

977
00:51:53,182 --> 00:51:54,676
Leo's friend, right?

978
00:51:54,711 --> 00:51:56,170
Mary, right?

979
00:51:56,206 --> 00:51:58,916
I never thought, but you
probably didn't expect

980
00:51:58,952 --> 00:51:59,890
to see me, either, right?

981
00:51:59,924 --> 00:52:00,654
Right?

982
00:52:00,689 --> 00:52:02,010
Right.

983
00:52:02,044 --> 00:52:03,747
That is why you're here?

984
00:52:03,783 --> 00:52:06,564
I'm here in the library.

985
00:52:06,597 --> 00:52:08,961
I usually go to the Eight.

986
00:52:08,996 --> 00:52:10,803
I go earlier.

987
00:52:10,838 --> 00:52:12,125
You should check out the Eight.

988
00:52:12,159 --> 00:52:13,618
Beautiful people.

989
00:52:13,653 --> 00:52:15,809
I bet.

00:52:15,843 --> 00:52:18,241
I connect with that meaning,
you know?

991
00:52:18,277 --> 00:52:22,898
There are a lot of people at the
Eight who's issues--

992
00:52:22,934 --> 00:52:27,729
but today, I couldn't make it,
you know?

Uh.
