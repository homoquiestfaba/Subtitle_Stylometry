00:00:27,578 --> 00:00:30,081
it was like she was a fairyman

6
00:00:31,649 --> 00:00:33,818
trying to take us to hell.

7
00:00:35,519 --> 00:00:39,690
[Narrator] Are you saying
ma'am, that there is a hell?

8
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:44,562
[Narrator] I'm calling

[Doll] Now I lay

00:04:05,463 --> 00:04:07,596
I pray the Lord my soul to keep.

46
00:08:33,431 --> 00:08:36,097
Thank you for calling
male phone sex hotline.

This is, Kanye.

48
00:08:43,974 --> 00:08:44,808
Shawn?

49
00:08:51,915 --> 00:08:53,281
Hey, that's your lunch.

50
00:08:53,283 --> 00:08:56,017
Well that was your lunch.

51
00:08:56,019 --> 00:08:57,819
So what did you get?

52
00:08:57,821 --> 00:09:00,255
Alright I think
I found something.

53
00:09:00,257 --> 00:09:01,490
Like what?

54
00:09:01,492 --> 00:09:03,058
I think I found
a haunted doll.

55
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:03,894
What?!

56
00:09:05,696 --> 00:09:06,828
Alright, where is she?

57
00:09:06,830 --> 00:09:07,829
Let's go, ill show you.

58
00:09:07,831 --> 00:09:08,666
Okay.

59
00:09:10,434 --> 00:09:12,768
So the lady I talked
to today said she called

60
00:09:12,770 --> 00:09:16,505
a paranormal group to come
out and cleanse her house.

61
00:09:16,507 --> 00:09:19,441
But it didn't work so
they just took the doll,

62
00:09:19,443 --> 00:09:22,310
and now it's being held here

63
00:09:22,312 --> 00:09:25,215
at U.S.A Paranormal
Haunted Museum.

64
00:09:27,385 --> 00:09:28,218
Okay.

65
00:09:29,252 --> 00:09:30,187
Alright so,

66
00:09:32,022 --> 00:09:33,522
so we gotta break her out.

67
00:09:33,524 --> 00:09:36,792
Either that or ask
her to give her over

68
00:09:36,794 --> 00:09:38,629
nicely for a few days.

69
00:09:39,730 --> 00:09:40,798
Okay, plan.

70
00:09:41,699 --> 00:09:43,098
Okay.

71
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:44,332
I'm gonna go watch a whole bunch

72
00:09:44,334 --> 00:09:46,067
of break out of jail movies.

73
00:09:46,069 --> 00:09:47,569
You do some actual work

74
00:09:47,571 --> 00:09:51,306
and figure out what
we're gonna do.

75
00:09:51,308 --> 00:09:53,308
Yeah I've already
got all that.

76
00:09:53,310 --> 00:09:54,743
No way.

77
00:09:54,745 --> 00:09:57,613
We have a scheduled meeting
with them in 15 minutes.

78
00:09:57,615 --> 00:09:58,580
What?!

79
00:09:58,582 --> 00:10:00,649
[imitates explosion]

80
00:10:00,651 --> 00:10:02,986
- Let's go.
- Let's do this!

81
00:10:05,255 --> 00:10:07,288
[Narrator] Shawn
stop being gay.

82
00:10:07,290 --> 00:10:10,025
This is a spider gremlin.

83
00:10:10,027 --> 00:10:11,259
A spider gremlin!

84
00:10:11,261 --> 00:10:12,728
At least that's
what we call it,

85
00:10:12,730 --> 00:10:16,698
because it can latch on to
anyone that makes eye contact

86
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:18,967
for too long and
reveal their deepest,

87
00:10:18,969 --> 00:10:21,403
darkest secrets and fears.

88
00:10:21,405 --> 00:10:22,438
Like a gremlin!

89
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:23,672
Shawn.

90
00:10:23,674 --> 00:10:24,940
I'm just saying,
I've seen the movie.

91
00:10:24,942 --> 00:10:26,842
No, but like a demon.

92
00:10:26,844 --> 00:10:30,412
So why don't you just
call it a demon, right?

93
00:10:30,414 --> 00:10:31,980
'Cause he called it a gremlin.

94
00:10:31,982 --> 00:10:33,048
Exactly.

95
00:10:33,050 --> 00:10:34,950
Thank you, thank you.

96
00:10:34,952 --> 00:10:36,418
Someone sides with me.

97
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:39,254
Right this way gentlemen.

98
00:10:39,256 --> 00:10:40,924
Hey, its your mom.

99
00:10:44,728 --> 00:10:47,565
And here we have
my grandmother.

100
00:10:48,832 --> 00:10:49,667
Ooh!

101
00:10:51,469 --> 00:10:53,702
And when she died we stole
her from the nursing home

102
00:10:53,704 --> 00:10:55,439
and brought her here.

103
00:10:57,340 --> 00:10:58,306
And...

104
00:10:58,308 --> 00:11:00,778
[Shawn] She's made of plastic.

105
00:11:07,785 --> 00:11:09,485
This is Susan.

106
00:11:09,487 --> 00:11:12,155
[ominous music]

107
00:11:16,226 --> 00:11:20,328
And story has it that she can
pull the soul of anyone that

108
00:11:20,330 --> 00:11:24,566
comes into physical contact
with her, directly into hell.

109
00:11:24,568 --> 00:11:27,268
Larry, not to
disagree with you

110
00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:30,171
but I think the
doll's name is Anna.

111
00:11:30,173 --> 00:11:32,440
No this is Susan.

112
00:11:32,442 --> 00:11:34,277
Susanna, my mistake.

113
00:11:35,613 --> 00:11:37,779
You do see the card says Anna?

114
00:11:37,781 --> 00:11:39,147
Yes I see it, shut up Shawn.

115
00:11:39,149 --> 00:11:40,381
Alright I'm just being.

116
00:11:40,383 --> 00:11:43,184
So Larry any uh chance
that any artifact

117
00:11:43,186 --> 00:11:45,623
could maybe leave this place?

118
00:11:46,790 --> 00:11:48,724
You can do any
investigations you want

119
00:11:48,726 --> 00:11:52,594
with anything in here, but
I cant let anything out.

120
00:11:52,596 --> 00:11:55,997
I'm sorry, I cant risk them
getting out into the public.

121
00:11:55,999 --> 00:12:00,035
Even if it is in the hands
of experienced Parators."

122
00:12:00,037 --> 00:12:00,838
Parator?

123
00:12:02,305 --> 00:12:05,340
Oh, he put Paranormal
Investigator together, okay.

124
00:12:05,342 --> 00:12:07,676
So there's not a
single way that...

125
00:12:07,678 --> 00:12:08,877
No.

126
00:12:08,879 --> 00:12:10,078
Anyone could take
anything from...

127
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:11,513
No.

128
00:12:11,515 --> 00:12:12,447
From this place to do a
little further investigation?

129
00:12:12,449 --> 00:12:13,248
I wish, my hands are tied.

130
00:12:13,250 --> 00:12:14,049
Under no circumstances?

131
00:12:14,051 --> 00:12:15,116
Nothing at all.

132
00:12:15,118 --> 00:12:16,184
No circumstances?

133
00:12:16,186 --> 00:12:17,152
Nothing at all.

134
00:12:17,154 --> 00:12:18,587
What about us two?

135
00:12:18,589 --> 00:12:21,189
I'm sorry I wish I
could help you gentlemen.

136
00:12:21,191 --> 00:12:23,026
Alright, I got this.

137
00:12:24,161 --> 00:12:25,927
Larry, mind showing
me your gift shop

138
00:12:25,929 --> 00:12:27,663
my friends here's
gonna use the bathroom.

139
00:12:27,665 --> 00:12:29,330
The restroom's not...

140
00:12:29,332 --> 00:12:30,498
Oh oh don't worry about him,

141
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:31,399
he'll find a corner
or something.

142
00:12:31,401 --> 00:12:32,834
What's that?

143
00:12:32,836 --> 00:12:36,404
Oh this is from an ancient
rail station accident.

144
00:12:36,406 --> 00:12:37,238
Rail station?

145
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:38,740
Mmm hmm.

146
00:12:38,742 --> 00:12:40,141
They say that when you're
in the presence of a demon,

147
00:12:40,143 --> 00:12:42,010
or any creature that collects
souls for that matter,

148
00:12:42,012 --> 00:12:44,980
you'll smell a foul smell in
the air almost like sulfur.

149
00:12:44,982 --> 00:12:46,014
Like from the
railroad way station?

150
00:12:46,016 --> 00:12:47,549
Mmm hmm, yeah.

151
00:12:47,551 --> 00:12:49,685
And you can actually feel

152
00:12:49,687 --> 00:12:53,454
the creature absorbing
your happiness

153
00:12:53,456 --> 00:12:56,459
and feeding negativity
back into ya.

154
00:12:57,928 --> 00:13:01,496
This story in particular
has everything.

155
00:13:01,498 --> 00:13:04,933
Mirror posses, mirror
visions possessions.

156
00:13:04,935 --> 00:13:06,635
It was a night unlike tonight

157
00:13:06,637 --> 00:13:08,972
when there was a fire in an,

158
00:13:10,107 --> 00:13:12,173
when there was a
fire in an orphanage

159
00:13:12,175 --> 00:13:15,043
and everything was destroyed.

160
00:13:15,045 --> 00:13:18,146
The table that she was
sitting on was burned.

161
00:13:18,148 --> 00:13:19,247
She...

162
00:13:19,249 --> 00:13:20,849
I couldn't find your toilet,

163
00:13:20,851 --> 00:13:23,351
but I did find a
nice little cranny

164
00:13:23,353 --> 00:13:24,620
where there was a
whole bunch of books.

165
00:13:24,622 --> 00:13:25,954
They're very absorbent."

166
00:13:25,956 --> 00:13:27,390
Those are rare!

167
00:13:28,258 --> 00:13:29,092
Ow.

168
00:13:44,908 --> 00:13:47,042
[Narrator] Good
evening friends.

169
00:13:47,044 --> 00:13:49,144
This is your host to welcome you

170
00:13:49,146 --> 00:13:53,314
through the creeping
door into the other side.

171
00:13:53,316 --> 00:13:55,318
For another gamble of...

00:15:39,823 --> 00:15:41,556
[Jake] Wait, wait, let
me get a focus on you.

178
00:15:41,558 --> 00:15:42,392
Okay.

179
00:15:45,628 --> 00:15:47,095

Action, go!

181
00:15:48,331 --> 00:15:50,465
Alright, what we're
setting up right now

182
00:15:50,467 --> 00:15:55,170
is what we like to call Seven
Days with a Haunted Doll.

183
00:15:55,172 --> 00:15:57,574
It's a, it's a working title.

184
00:15:58,541 --> 00:16:00,177
But before we start,

185
00:16:01,044 --> 00:16:04,345
boom, for our Youtube viewers,

186
00:16:04,347 --> 00:16:06,915
we're gonna take a shot.

187
00:16:06,917 --> 00:16:08,651
[Jake] Wooo, spicy!

188
00:16:10,954 --> 00:16:14,691
I'm not good with
alcohol but, that's good.

189
00:16:15,893 --> 00:16:19,227
Alright, so what we're
doing is we're filming

190
00:16:19,229 --> 00:16:23,166
this in a haunted location,
supposedly haunted.

191
00:16:24,301 --> 00:16:27,936
Alright so, let me show
you where she's at.

192
00:16:27,938 --> 00:16:30,305
This is Anna's bedroom.

193
00:16:30,307 --> 00:16:31,308
That's Anna.

194
00:16:32,475 --> 00:16:35,710
As you can tell,
that's her crib.

195
00:16:35,712 --> 00:16:37,547
Now Jake tucks her in.

196
00:16:39,649 --> 00:16:40,648
Go ahead.

197
00:16:40,650 --> 00:16:42,150
Show everybody.

198
00:16:42,152 --> 00:16:44,319
I'm putting the EMF detector
on either sides of the crib

199
00:16:44,321 --> 00:16:45,686
with the KEMF.

200
00:16:45,688 --> 00:16:46,988
[laughter]

201
00:16:46,990 --> 00:16:48,456
Laser grid.

202
00:16:48,458 --> 00:16:50,826
So that way we can even
get even measurements

203
00:16:50,828 --> 00:16:54,729
on any other-worldly phenomenon
that may be occurring.

204
00:16:54,731 --> 00:16:58,902
Alright, so we're gonna
have laser grids, PK meters.

205
00:17:00,337 --> 00:17:03,404
Lets see, we're gonna
have EMF detectors,

206
00:17:03,406 --> 00:17:06,341
ouija boards, anything
and everything

207
00:17:06,343 --> 00:17:09,510
to measure the paranormal realm.

208
00:17:09,512 --> 00:17:14,282
We're setting up the greatest
investigation known to man.

209
00:17:14,284 --> 00:17:15,618
So, let's begin.

210
00:17:18,221 --> 00:17:19,056
Day one.

211
00:17:20,190 --> 00:17:21,122
[Jake] That was awesome.

212
00:17:21,124 --> 00:17:22,390
Alright you wanna do the...

213
00:17:22,392 --> 00:17:23,458
Yeah, yeah.

214
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:24,893
We're still rolling yeah.

215
00:17:24,895 --> 00:17:27,028
Alright let's go the...

216
00:17:27,030 --> 00:17:28,663
So let's begin.

217
00:17:28,665 --> 00:17:29,499
Day one.

218
00:17:31,068 --> 00:17:32,200
Alright hold on.

219
00:17:32,202 --> 00:17:33,036
Day one.

220
00:17:34,337 --> 00:17:35,570
Yeah yeah yeah, yeah.

221
00:17:35,572 --> 00:17:37,505

It looks like the
side of her cheek

245
00:20:23,106 --> 00:20:25,508
is holding some sort of heat.

246
00:20:27,910 --> 00:20:30,011
Well maybe she's blushing.

247
00:20:30,013 --> 00:20:31,912
Try giving her a little
peck on the cheek.

248
00:20:31,914 --> 00:20:33,516
Just a little muah.

249
00:20:38,821 --> 00:20:41,558
[faint creaking]

250
00:20:43,460 --> 00:20:46,063
Okay so I found a few things.

251
00:20:47,630 --> 00:20:49,466
Alright so, apparently

252
00:20:51,368 --> 00:20:53,668
all of the victims are...

253
00:20:53,670 --> 00:20:54,869
Woah woah woah,

254
00:20:54,871 --> 00:20:57,905
are you saying the
victims are not victims.

255
00:20:57,907 --> 00:21:00,908
Wait, are you
saying that air quotes

256
00:21:00,910 --> 00:21:02,577
are some kind of sarcastic?

257
00:21:02,579 --> 00:21:03,813
Course is it.

258
00:21:05,382 --> 00:21:08,116
Wait and everyone knows this?

259
00:21:08,118 --> 00:21:10,120
It's common knowledge.

260
00:21:11,921 --> 00:21:12,755
Huh.

261
00:21:14,457 --> 00:21:16,424
There's a lot of
people in my life

262
00:21:16,426 --> 00:21:19,794
that are really confused by now.

263
00:21:19,796 --> 00:21:21,529
"Shawn, what were you saying?

264
00:21:21,531 --> 00:21:22,365
Oh.

265
00:21:25,102 --> 00:21:27,537
Alright so mainly all of the,

266
00:21:29,106 --> 00:21:32,006
all of the victims are women.

267
00:21:32,008 --> 00:21:33,343
Mainly or all?

268
00:21:36,979 --> 00:21:38,546
What do you mean?

269
00:21:38,548 --> 00:21:41,249
Were all the victims
female or weren't they?

270
00:21:41,251 --> 00:21:43,784
You say mainly
which means maybe,

271
00:21:43,786 --> 00:21:45,820
yes is a definitive answer.

272
00:21:45,822 --> 00:21:48,658
So was it a maybe
or was it a yes?

273
00:21:50,893 --> 00:21:51,728
Yes.

274
00:21:54,631 --> 00:21:55,465
Yes.

275
00:21:57,867 --> 00:22:00,701
We really need to work
on your communication.

276
00:22:00,703 --> 00:22:03,640
We need to work
on your attitude.

277
00:22:05,708 --> 00:22:08,109
So what your saying
is we need girls.

278
00:22:08,111 --> 00:22:08,945
Yeah.

279
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:13,350
Where are we gonna
find one of those?

280
00:22:27,597 --> 00:22:29,063
I don't think a personal
add on the internet

281
00:22:29,065 --> 00:22:30,765
was the best solution Shawn.

282
00:22:30,767 --> 00:22:32,133
[laughter]

283
00:22:32,135 --> 00:22:34,369
It's better than you
sitting around a mall

284
00:22:34,371 --> 00:22:37,272
using your whole green
eggs and ham line.

285
00:22:37,274 --> 00:22:38,439
Are you kidding me?

286
00:22:38,441 --> 00:22:40,007
That's a great line Shawn.

287
00:22:40,009 --> 00:22:43,077
Oh no, I don't
doubt the method,

288
00:22:43,079 --> 00:22:44,147
just the man.

289
00:22:53,089 --> 00:22:57,260
Are you two Jake Smack-my-bottom,
and Shawn McGreedy?

290
00:22:58,361 --> 00:22:59,596
Oh no, Shawn.

291
00:23:00,730 --> 00:23:01,564
Oh.

292
00:23:02,565 --> 00:23:03,864
[Jake] And you are?

293
00:23:03,866 --> 00:23:04,701
Kat.

294
00:23:06,636 --> 00:23:09,504
Oh wait, like the animal?

295
00:23:09,506 --> 00:23:12,675
Kat, it's great
to finally meet you.

296
00:23:13,843 --> 00:23:17,180
Nice to meet you too
Mr. Smack-my-bottom.

297
00:23:19,916 --> 00:23:22,252
You can just call me Jake.

298
00:23:23,486 --> 00:23:24,752
It's cool.

299
00:23:24,754 --> 00:23:26,387
I've meet so many
people with odd names

300
00:23:26,389 --> 00:23:28,889
that it doesn't even
phase me anymore.

301
00:23:28,891 --> 00:23:30,758
Well isn't that nice?

302
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:32,262
Oh, yeah, ha ha.

303
00:23:33,663 --> 00:23:35,730
So you read the ad.

304
00:23:35,732 --> 00:23:39,767
Do you have any concerns
about it first off?

305
00:23:39,769 --> 00:23:43,003
All the ad said was that
you need a girl ya know,

306
00:23:43,005 --> 00:23:45,740
to spend a few
days at some place,

307
00:23:45,742 --> 00:23:48,144
experience some weird things.

308
00:23:52,815 --> 00:23:55,483
Well that's very descriptive.

309
00:23:55,485 --> 00:23:57,151
So we are going
to do some things

310
00:23:57,153 --> 00:24:00,056
that are a bit out
of the ordinary.

311
00:24:01,391 --> 00:24:03,826
I'm fine with weird things.

312
00:24:04,827 --> 00:24:07,094
That doesn't bother me.

313
00:24:07,096 --> 00:24:11,499
But, if it's going to be
more than just you two

314
00:24:11,501 --> 00:24:13,568
then I'm going to
have to draw the line.

315
00:24:13,570 --> 00:24:17,073
I did that once, wasn't
a good week after.

316
00:24:21,210 --> 00:24:22,510
Oh.

317
00:24:22,512 --> 00:24:24,681
Yeah it's just us two and,

318
00:24:26,148 --> 00:24:29,116
you don't mind us filming right?

319
00:24:29,118 --> 00:24:30,918
I'm fine with that.

320
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:34,389
You can do whatever
you want, really.

321
00:24:34,391 --> 00:24:37,558
How do you feel about dolls?

322
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:39,294
I'm fine with them.

323
00:24:39,296 --> 00:24:42,465
They can be a bit
creepy at times but,

324
00:24:43,633 --> 00:24:46,603
I can fit just about
anything you want.

325
00:24:49,005 --> 00:24:52,006
Depends on how big
the doll is but,

326
00:24:52,008 --> 00:24:54,844
then again I'll
try anything once.

327
00:24:56,746 --> 00:24:57,680
I'm lost.

328
00:24:58,815 --> 00:25:01,851
So are you into the
paranormal at all?

329
00:25:04,654 --> 00:25:08,122
I was a fortune
teller for a fair once.

330
00:25:08,124 --> 00:25:10,190
Oh highly qualified!

331
00:25:10,192 --> 00:25:12,927
Well you little miss are hired.

332
00:25:12,929 --> 00:25:16,497
We want to start tonight
if that works for you.

333
00:25:16,499 --> 00:25:19,667
I could do tonight, that
wouldn't be a problem.

334
00:25:19,669 --> 00:25:21,035
You two got my number?

335
00:25:21,037 --> 00:25:22,805
Oh yeah right here.

336
00:25:24,374 --> 00:25:26,307
Well, just text me the address

337
00:25:26,309 --> 00:25:28,645
and the time, I'll be there.

338
00:25:29,746 --> 00:25:30,978
Awesome!

339
00:25:30,980 --> 00:25:32,680
Thank you so much.

340
00:25:32,682 --> 00:25:34,451
Oh before I forget,

341
00:25:35,818 --> 00:25:38,218
you two got plenty
of protection right?

342
00:25:38,220 --> 00:25:39,487
Protection?

343
00:25:39,489 --> 00:25:40,721
Protection?

344
00:25:40,723 --> 00:25:42,557
Yeah, protection.

345
00:25:42,559 --> 00:25:43,893
Oh wait, guns?

346
00:25:45,094 --> 00:25:45,928
Knives?

347
00:25:47,430 --> 00:25:50,465
Oh no we watch plenty
of martial arts movies.

348
00:25:50,467 --> 00:25:52,301
My body is a weapon!

349
00:25:59,676 --> 00:26:02,209
[Kat] See you tonight.

350
00:26:02,211 --> 00:26:04,412
See you tonight.

351
00:26:04,414 --> 00:26:06,080
What are you thinking?!

352
00:26:06,082 --> 00:26:06,914
Run?

353
00:26:06,916 --> 00:26:08,084
She's crazy.

354
00:26:14,323 --> 00:26:15,157
Hi.

355
00:26:16,092 --> 00:26:17,927
I'm here about the ad.

356
00:26:22,999 --> 00:26:25,833
[Shawn] Dude your
uncles place sucks.

357
00:26:25,835 --> 00:26:30,304
Yeah he had a lot of Prada
projects before he passed.

358
00:26:30,306 --> 00:26:33,874
[Shawn] Oh, maybe fixing
the heat wasn't one of them.

359
00:26:33,876 --> 00:26:34,711
Yeah.

360
00:26:35,612 --> 00:26:37,011
Oh.

361
00:26:37,013 --> 00:26:39,246
It's got me, it's got me.

362
00:26:39,248 --> 00:26:41,148
Yep yep yep.

363
00:26:41,150 --> 00:26:42,385
Ah, it sucks.

364
00:26:44,053 --> 00:26:44,885
Hey Shawn.

365
00:26:44,887 --> 00:26:46,421
Yea?

366
00:26:46,423 --> 00:26:48,756
Why did you tell that girl
my name was Smack-my-bottom?

367
00:26:48,758 --> 00:26:51,661
No no no, I said
Smack-my-tottum.

368
00:26:52,762 --> 00:26:53,596
Okay so,

369
00:26:55,432 --> 00:26:58,799
so I get that and
you get McGreedy?

370
00:26:58,801 --> 00:27:00,034
I mean, I mean it's
fine if you want

371
00:27:00,036 --> 00:27:02,605
to be Kurt Russel
from The Thing.

372
00:27:04,541 --> 00:27:07,442
Oh yeah, that's
what it was from.

373
00:27:07,444 --> 00:27:08,643
Totally didn't make
the connection.

374
00:27:08,645 --> 00:27:10,146
Sure you didn't.

375
00:27:11,914 --> 00:27:14,651
Did we grab anything
to feed her?

376
00:27:16,218 --> 00:27:17,386
To feed her?

377
00:27:20,923 --> 00:27:21,956
What do you mean?

378
00:27:21,958 --> 00:27:23,658
Are you serious?

379
00:27:23,660 --> 00:27:25,192
We don't have
anything to feed her?

380
00:27:25,194 --> 00:27:27,227
You cant invite a woman
over to your house...

381
00:27:27,229 --> 00:27:30,531
To a haunted house
with a haunted doll

382
00:27:30,533 --> 00:27:32,535
and two strangers, yeah.

383
00:27:34,070 --> 00:27:36,506
Yeah and not give her food!

384
00:27:38,207 --> 00:27:40,841
And what does she eat
oh grand seuth sayer

385
00:27:40,843 --> 00:27:42,445
of estrogen throne?

386
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:47,617
Slayer of clouds and freer
of the house of Willie?

387
00:27:49,952 --> 00:27:52,054
We need a veggie plate.

388
00:27:52,955 --> 00:27:54,388
Veggie plate?

389
00:27:54,390 --> 00:27:55,823
Yes a veggie plate.

390
00:27:55,825 --> 00:27:57,892
A woman feels comfortable
when there's a plate

391
00:27:57,894 --> 00:28:01,330
for her to eat on of
delicious vegetables!

392
00:28:03,032 --> 00:28:04,699
Where do you get?

393
00:28:04,701 --> 00:28:07,167
How do you get your information?

394
00:28:07,169 --> 00:28:09,804
Where would we even buy that?!

395
00:28:09,806 --> 00:28:12,172
And she's coming in like
three minutes anyways.

396
00:28:12,174 --> 00:28:13,808
Shawn.

397
00:28:13,810 --> 00:28:15,275
Yeah?

398
00:28:15,277 --> 00:28:16,844
No one is getting through
that door until we have a plate

399
00:28:16,846 --> 00:28:20,715
of delicious vegetables
for them to eat.

400
00:28:20,717 --> 00:28:21,551
I mean it.

401
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:25,154
Alright.

402
00:28:26,155 --> 00:28:27,988
Okay I'll send her a text,

403
00:28:27,990 --> 00:28:29,890
tell her if we're
not back in time

404
00:28:29,892 --> 00:28:32,693
to just go around
back, come right in.

405
00:28:32,695 --> 00:28:33,528
Good.

406
00:28:33,530 --> 00:28:34,361
Alright?

407
00:28:34,363 --> 00:28:37,164
Yep, and you're driving.

408
00:28:37,166 --> 00:28:38,668
Don't hand me...

409
00:28:42,371 --> 00:28:43,205
Fine.

This better be worth it.

00:30:30,412 --> 00:30:31,914
Why is it so cold?

422
00:30:40,990 --> 00:30:42,158
What the hell?

423
00:30:46,629 --> 00:30:47,964

You guys need to stop messing
around or I'm leaving.

No, I don't know
why you always make it

454
00:36:01,377 --> 00:36:02,542
more difficult
than it should be.

455
00:36:02,544 --> 00:36:03,777
You really do.

456
00:36:03,779 --> 00:36:05,912
Next time, give her your number.

457
00:36:05,914 --> 00:36:09,683
She was mentally handicap
bagging our groceries Shawn.

458
00:36:09,685 --> 00:36:12,286
What do you mean she was
winking at you the entire time.

459
00:36:12,288 --> 00:36:13,954
I'm sure that was
apart of her handicap,

460
00:36:13,956 --> 00:36:16,623
she blinked all the time.

461
00:36:16,625 --> 00:36:19,059
Well she only
had blinks for you.

462
00:36:19,061 --> 00:36:21,161
[faint dispatch]

463
00:36:21,163 --> 00:36:23,665
Hey, I wonder what happened.

464
00:36:25,467 --> 00:36:29,336
Diarrhea, indigestion,
mesothelioma,

465
00:36:29,338 --> 00:36:31,138
they are all killers.

466
00:36:31,140 --> 00:36:33,173
Your just listing off
commercials you've seen.

467
00:36:33,175 --> 00:36:36,578
That's where I get
all of my knowledge.

468
00:36:38,780 --> 00:36:40,047
Ooh it's cold!

469
00:36:40,049 --> 00:36:41,450
She'll love this.

470
00:36:42,518 --> 00:36:43,352
Oh!

471
00:36:44,420 --> 00:36:47,156
So whose wasting
electricity now?

472
00:36:50,159 --> 00:36:53,562
You were the last
one out of the house.

473
00:36:57,666 --> 00:37:00,400
I did that on purpose.

474
00:37:00,402 --> 00:37:01,970
It was intentional.

475
00:37:03,572 --> 00:37:04,904
I guess she
didn't show up yet.

476
00:37:04,906 --> 00:37:06,806
[creaking]

477
00:37:06,808 --> 00:37:07,641
Shame.

[loud creaking]

479
00:37:09,078 --> 00:37:11,878
You know, I'm
kinda glad she didn't

480
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:13,913
because I kinda got
a feeling that girl

481
00:37:13,915 --> 00:37:16,450
was a bit of a freak.

482
00:37:16,452 --> 00:37:20,454
She seemed to turn
everything we said sexual.

483
00:37:20,456 --> 00:37:23,959
I bet she was trying
to hit on both of us.

484
00:37:26,528 --> 00:37:28,764
[creaking]

485
00:38:10,072 --> 00:38:11,238
[Shawn] Hey Jake.

486
00:38:11,240 --> 00:38:12,074
Yeah?

487
00:38:13,409 --> 00:38:16,843
I think a beaver or
something's getting in.

488
00:38:16,845 --> 00:38:18,514
Could be a possum.

489
00:38:19,515 --> 00:38:20,614
Beaver?

490
00:38:20,616 --> 00:38:22,116
Really?

491
00:38:22,118 --> 00:38:25,621
That's your first animal for
trying to get into the house?

492
00:38:27,356 --> 00:38:30,859
Aw Anna, that mean
old possum scare you?

493
00:38:32,828 --> 00:38:33,662
Opossum.

494
00:38:35,364 --> 00:38:37,664
That's what I said, opossum.

495
00:38:37,666 --> 00:38:38,798
No.

496
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:39,635
O.

497
00:38:40,836 --> 00:38:44,238
There's an O in front
of possum, opossum."

498
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:48,942
Do you have to argue
with me in front of Anna?

499
00:38:48,944 --> 00:38:51,611
Wait at least until
she's out of the room.

500
00:38:51,613 --> 00:38:54,450
Aw Anna, tomorrow
we're gonna meet

501
00:38:55,817 --> 00:38:59,253
a satanic lady whose
gonna see if your actually

502
00:38:59,255 --> 00:39:01,290
full of demons and stuff.

503
00:39:02,391 --> 00:39:05,794
And this guy right
there might have a date,

504
00:39:06,962 --> 00:39:09,064
because she's kinda cute.

505
00:39:10,632 --> 00:39:11,865
If I can overlook the fact

506
00:39:11,867 --> 00:39:14,100
that she's working
with witchcraft.

507
00:39:14,102 --> 00:39:15,302
[faint creaking]

508
00:39:15,304 --> 00:39:18,305
No, no I don't
think I can Shawn.

509
00:39:18,307 --> 00:39:19,806
Oh yeah?

510
00:39:19,808 --> 00:39:23,645
Or we'll just sit here and
eat our vegetable tray.

511
00:39:26,882 --> 00:39:28,782
[Jake] Quick look
at this over here!

512
00:39:28,784 --> 00:39:29,916
It's like a real one.

513
00:39:29,918 --> 00:39:31,587
[Shawn] Echo echo.

514
00:39:32,988 --> 00:39:34,454
[Jake] I feel like we're
underneath the street,

515
00:39:34,456 --> 00:39:35,455
we're under the street.

516
00:39:35,457 --> 00:39:37,459
[Shawn] Whoa, careful.

517
00:39:38,594 --> 00:39:39,859
Spiderweb.

518
00:39:39,861 --> 00:39:41,295
Let's get that web,
let's get that web.

519
00:39:41,297 --> 00:39:42,596
It's like moms house right now.

520
00:39:42,598 --> 00:39:43,430
[Jake] Let's roll.

521
00:39:43,432 --> 00:39:44,664
[Shawn] Okay.

522
00:39:44,666 --> 00:39:45,699
Ready? Let me get a focus.

523
00:39:45,701 --> 00:39:46,633
[Shawn] Yep, I'm ready.

524
00:39:46,635 --> 00:39:47,467
[Jake] Alright, focused.

525
00:39:47,469 --> 00:39:48,302
[Shawn] You ready?

526
00:39:48,304 --> 00:39:50,069
[Jake] Yep. Recording.

527
00:39:50,071 --> 00:39:52,172
Okay so we're here.

528
00:39:52,174 --> 00:39:54,708
We're following some
kind of creepy vamp kid

529
00:39:54,710 --> 00:39:56,210
through something.

530
00:39:56,212 --> 00:39:59,045
We are completely
underground right now.

531
00:39:59,047 --> 00:40:01,215
I'm not sure where we are.

532
00:40:01,217 --> 00:40:02,616
Notice, look at all this.

533
00:40:02,618 --> 00:40:04,017
Okay.

534
00:40:04,019 --> 00:40:08,021
So we're about to see
the satanic ritual

535
00:40:08,023 --> 00:40:09,523
momentarily.

536
00:40:09,525 --> 00:40:10,424
[Jake] Alright you
can keep rolling.

537
00:40:10,426 --> 00:40:11,258
Are you ready for this?

538
00:40:11,260 --> 00:40:12,428
[Shawn] Yep.

539
00:40:14,162 --> 00:40:15,195
Come this way.

540
00:40:15,197 --> 00:40:16,763
She's preparing.

541
00:40:16,765 --> 00:40:18,767
[Shawn] Come this way.

542
00:40:20,636 --> 00:40:22,971
Your place is spider-webbed.

543
00:40:30,045 --> 00:40:30,879
Hmm?

544
00:40:31,813 --> 00:40:32,648
Clem

545
00:40:33,715 --> 00:40:34,550
Clem.

546
00:40:36,518 --> 00:40:38,086
You're name's Clem?

547
00:40:39,421 --> 00:40:40,587
That's a little weird.

548
00:40:40,589 --> 00:40:42,424
Okay so, one question.

549
00:40:44,059 --> 00:40:48,127
Why is there a naked
bloody chick on the floor?"

550
00:40:48,129 --> 00:40:50,732
Her name is Princess Jasmine.

551
00:40:51,867 --> 00:40:53,166
Don't.

552
00:40:53,168 --> 00:40:54,436
I'm so gonna.

553
00:40:58,607 --> 00:41:00,709
[moaning]

554
00:41:13,322 --> 00:41:14,153
He's got the eyes for you.

555
00:41:14,155 --> 00:41:14,990
Shhhh.

556
00:41:20,929 --> 00:41:22,562
Hi there.

557
00:41:22,564 --> 00:41:23,399
I'm sorry.

558
00:41:25,133 --> 00:41:27,967
I'm sorry I was just
preparing my soul

559
00:41:27,969 --> 00:41:31,170
for the darkness that awaits.

560
00:41:31,172 --> 00:41:35,076
[Jake] And that required
what you were doing?

561
00:41:36,011 --> 00:41:37,513
The ritual, yes.

562
00:41:40,048 --> 00:41:42,217
The ritual requires you to

563
00:41:44,553 --> 00:41:47,222
succumb to all earthly elements,

564
00:41:49,691 --> 00:41:51,760
and be one with the dirt.

565
00:41:54,596 --> 00:41:57,666
And you had to
wear the goat skull?

566
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:00,101
The goat, yes.

567
00:42:02,438 --> 00:42:04,804
The goat represents
the bond that we have

568
00:42:04,806 --> 00:42:06,742
with the unholy father.

569
00:42:12,881 --> 00:42:15,884
So is that why
you used the blood?

570
00:42:18,887 --> 00:42:21,655
Yeah, how else do you
think I got the goat skull?

571
00:42:21,657 --> 00:42:24,123
Like, are you two sure that
you're ready to be doing this?

572
00:42:24,125 --> 00:42:26,560
This isn't some sort of
internet joke video right?

573
00:42:26,562 --> 00:42:27,394
Of course...

574
00:42:27,396 --> 00:42:28,227
Not!

575
00:42:28,229 --> 00:42:29,062
It's not.

576
00:42:29,064 --> 00:42:30,530
Don't say anything.

577
00:42:30,532 --> 00:42:33,600
Everything that we're doing
is completely [stutters]

578
00:42:33,602 --> 00:42:36,872
legit and is for us
to truly experience

579
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:41,142
our friend who is in the doll.

580
00:42:45,313 --> 00:42:50,116
You see, what my friend's
trying to say here is,

581
00:42:50,118 --> 00:42:52,120
we wanna see this bitch.

582
00:42:56,224 --> 00:43:00,362
Well boys, don't worry
your pretty little heads.

583
00:43:01,897 --> 00:43:03,231
We will see this

584
00:43:04,833 --> 00:43:05,667
bitch.

585
00:43:11,740 --> 00:43:12,572
So...

586
00:43:12,574 --> 00:43:13,507
Shhhh!

587
00:43:13,509 --> 00:43:15,243
May I see the doll?

588
00:43:20,416 --> 00:43:22,017
Yes, yes you may.

589
00:43:23,351 --> 00:43:24,520
But you see we

590
00:43:26,221 --> 00:43:28,289
left the doll in the car.

591
00:43:30,091 --> 00:43:33,762
Because we didn't want
to just bring her in.

592
00:43:34,630 --> 00:43:35,562
You left her in the car?

593
00:43:35,564 --> 00:43:36,496
I told you to bring her in.

594
00:43:36,498 --> 00:43:37,964
I didn't want to impose.

595
00:43:37,966 --> 00:43:39,766
You need to bring her in when
I tell you to bring her in.

596
00:43:39,768 --> 00:43:42,771
You know what,
you need to stop...

597
00:43:45,741 --> 00:43:46,642
I am sorry.

598
00:43:49,945 --> 00:43:52,514
I left the window cracked okay!

599
00:43:56,952 --> 00:43:58,386
Alright, alright.

600
00:43:59,988 --> 00:44:01,588
I will be right back.

601
00:44:01,590 --> 00:44:03,324
I'm gonna go get her.

602
00:44:04,760 --> 00:44:05,592
This way right?

603
00:44:05,594 --> 00:44:06,428
Yeah.

604
00:44:10,131 --> 00:44:12,868
I'll stay and
do some research.

605
00:44:21,710 --> 00:44:24,379
[ominous music]

606
00:44:34,690 --> 00:44:35,757
Here we go.

607
00:44:37,826 --> 00:44:38,660
Alright,

608
00:44:40,061 --> 00:44:43,932
now, both of you have to
show me that you are clean.

609
00:44:48,970 --> 00:44:50,405
Oh don't worry,

610
00:44:51,573 --> 00:44:52,407
I washed.

611
00:44:57,145 --> 00:44:58,712
No.

612
00:44:58,714 --> 00:45:02,818
Meaning both of you cannot
be wearing any clothing.

613
00:45:04,686 --> 00:45:05,785
Wait, I'm sorry, what?

614
00:45:05,787 --> 00:45:07,789
Like shirts and pants.

615
00:45:09,491 --> 00:45:10,592
Everything.

616
00:45:12,961 --> 00:45:13,795
Socks?

617
00:45:14,763 --> 00:45:15,597
Mmhm.

618
00:45:19,034 --> 00:45:21,202
I'm not doing that Jake.

619
00:45:22,370 --> 00:45:24,105
Well, if you don't,

620
00:45:25,741 --> 00:45:27,006
neither one of you
can be down here

621
00:45:27,008 --> 00:45:29,277
to take part in the ritual.

622
00:45:30,178 --> 00:45:31,244
Alright let's go home.

623
00:45:31,246 --> 00:45:32,178
Pack it up.

624
00:45:32,180 --> 00:45:33,713
- Get the doll.
- Come on.

625
00:45:33,715 --> 00:45:34,614
[Jake] You were the one
that suggested we do this.

626
00:45:34,616 --> 00:45:36,482
Yeah, suggested!

627
00:45:36,484 --> 00:45:37,717
I'm telling you right now,

628
00:45:37,719 --> 00:45:39,318
you talk me out of
things all the time.

629
00:45:39,320 --> 00:45:41,087
I bet you if she was 300 pounds,

630
00:45:41,089 --> 00:45:43,289
hairy, and named Patrick,

631
00:45:43,291 --> 00:45:45,659
you'd be singing a
different tune right now.

632
00:45:45,661 --> 00:45:47,193
Okay well she's not.

633
00:45:47,195 --> 00:45:48,394
She's a babe.

634
00:45:48,396 --> 00:45:50,063
Oh yeah, you're
gonna think that one.

635
00:45:50,065 --> 00:45:51,631
Her name is princess Jasmine.

636
00:45:51,633 --> 00:45:52,866
How does that help me?

637
00:45:52,868 --> 00:45:54,768
Hey I'm gonna do this!

638
00:45:54,770 --> 00:45:55,602
Go ahead.

639
00:45:55,604 --> 00:45:56,703
Okay.

640
00:45:56,705 --> 00:45:57,704
Go ahead.

641
00:45:57,706 --> 00:45:58,540
Well...

642
00:46:00,676 --> 00:46:02,776
You can run out and
you can be "that guy".

643
00:46:02,778 --> 00:46:05,411
Or you can suck it up and
you can get naked with me

644
00:46:05,413 --> 00:46:06,982
and a strange lady.

645
00:46:12,821 --> 00:46:15,922
You know, when
you put it that way

646
00:46:15,924 --> 00:46:17,490
it kinda sounds like fun.

647
00:46:17,492 --> 00:46:19,659
Hey, it's like a dare.

648
00:46:19,661 --> 00:46:21,294
Go for it.

649
00:46:21,296 --> 00:46:23,830
Something I've
never done before.

650
00:46:23,832 --> 00:46:25,834
I'm not doing that Jake!

651
00:46:27,002 --> 00:46:28,902
I'm not gonna get
naked with you!

652
00:46:28,904 --> 00:46:31,504
I'm not gonna get naked with her

653
00:46:31,506 --> 00:46:33,575
and especially that doll!

654
00:46:35,243 --> 00:46:36,144
I hate you.

655
00:46:39,781 --> 00:46:43,149
We're about to witness
a real-life ghost.

656
00:46:43,151 --> 00:46:46,655
We're editing this
part out of the show.

657
00:46:47,555 --> 00:46:48,688
Show?

658
00:46:48,690 --> 00:46:49,956
Show.

659
00:46:49,958 --> 00:46:51,459
Oh a show, show.

660
00:46:53,428 --> 00:46:55,931
We were not showing ourselves.

661
00:46:58,399 --> 00:47:01,200
[Both] No we are
showing ourselves.

662
00:47:01,202 --> 00:47:04,203
But your not showing yourself

663
00:47:04,205 --> 00:47:05,504
He said show he
didn't mean the show

664
00:47:05,506 --> 00:47:08,742
the way you thought
he meant show.

665
00:47:08,744 --> 00:47:09,909
[Shawn] Right.

666
00:47:09,911 --> 00:47:11,110
[Jake] Yeah,
that's what we said.

667
00:47:11,112 --> 00:47:12,946
I haven't started
the ritual yet.

668
00:47:12,948 --> 00:47:14,683
And being in control,

669
00:47:16,184 --> 00:47:20,121
I choose to show myself
spiritually instead of physically.

670
00:47:22,891 --> 00:47:26,359
Well that explains everything.

671
00:47:26,361 --> 00:47:27,195
Sure.

672
00:47:28,596 --> 00:47:31,898
Okay, everybody
close your eyes.

673
00:47:31,900 --> 00:47:34,569
[ghostly winds]

674
00:47:50,752 --> 00:47:53,419
Is everybody's
eyes still closed?

675
00:47:53,421 --> 00:47:54,255
Yes.

676
00:47:55,456 --> 00:47:58,126
The spirits seem
a bit aggressive.

677
00:48:00,628 --> 00:48:04,132
[speaks foreign language]

678
00:48:15,911 --> 00:48:18,579
[ghostly winds]

679
00:48:24,519 --> 00:48:27,088
[low rumbling]

680
00:48:39,634 --> 00:48:42,637
[ghostly breathing]

681
00:48:50,411 --> 00:48:53,081
[ominous music]

682
00:49:00,021 --> 00:49:02,557
[faint scream]

683
00:49:20,708 --> 00:49:23,544
[whimsical music]

684
00:49:28,183 --> 00:49:29,450
She's here now.

685
00:49:31,119 --> 00:49:32,620
She's in the room.

686
00:49:34,756 --> 00:49:39,158
She's not revealing
herself to me just yet.

687
00:49:39,160 --> 00:49:40,693
Bring her in Jasmine.

688
00:49:40,695 --> 00:49:41,763
Bring her in.

689
00:49:45,666 --> 00:49:48,169
She's angry for some reason.

690
00:50:00,348 --> 00:50:01,249
She's here.

691
00:50:02,283 --> 00:50:04,417
[loud thud]

692
00:50:04,419 --> 00:50:07,553
[crackling]

693
00:50:07,555 --> 00:50:10,325
[loud screaming]

694
00:50:13,995 --> 00:50:16,664
[ominous music]

695
00:50:19,667 --> 00:50:22,070
[loud thuds]

696
00:51:04,779 --> 00:51:06,312
Hello.

697
00:51:06,314 --> 00:51:09,282
[loud thud]
[suspenseful music]

698
00:51:09,284 --> 00:51:10,683
Ugh.

699
00:51:10,685 --> 00:51:12,751
Oh is that normal?

700
00:51:12,753 --> 00:51:16,489
[Jake] That, yeah this is
okay it happens all the time.

701
00:51:16,491 --> 00:51:17,392
You okay?

702
00:51:18,359 --> 00:51:19,225
Jasmine?

703
00:51:19,227 --> 00:51:20,628
Princess Jasmine?

704
00:51:22,097 --> 00:51:23,531
Need some soap?

705
00:51:24,832 --> 00:51:27,166
A hot glue gun, do
you have a hot glue gun?

706
00:51:27,168 --> 00:51:28,467
You need glue.

707
00:51:28,469 --> 00:51:32,640
[suspenseful music]
[raspy breathing]

708
00:51:55,263 --> 00:51:57,999
[faint growling]

709
00:52:04,672 --> 00:52:07,342
[loud growling]

710
00:52:10,078 --> 00:52:12,813
[loud screaming]

711
00:52:13,681 --> 00:52:16,017
[loud thud]

712
00:52:17,285 --> 00:52:21,456
[loud growling]
[ominous music]

713
00:52:29,464 --> 00:52:32,033
[low rumbling]

714
00:52:34,802 --> 00:52:37,138
Shawn are you still naked?

715
00:52:42,043 --> 00:52:43,044
Yeah, you?

716
00:52:46,047 --> 00:52:47,715
It wasn't a dream.

717
00:52:49,184 --> 00:52:50,950
[loud creaking]

718
00:52:50,952 --> 00:52:53,786
[loud screaming]

719
00:52:53,788 --> 00:52:57,959
Head straight for the street,
get the hell out of here!

720
00:53:01,362 --> 00:53:04,163
It's some kind of
Willy Wonka ghost!

721
00:53:04,165 --> 00:53:06,834
[ghostly winds]

722
00:53:10,138 --> 00:53:11,304
[Both] Window!

723
00:53:11,306 --> 00:53:13,975
[ominous music]

724
00:53:20,948 --> 00:53:22,915
[Shawn] Hold on, we got this.

725
00:53:22,917 --> 00:53:23,818
I got this.

726
00:53:26,854 --> 00:53:27,688
I missed!

727
00:53:29,357 --> 00:53:31,426
I didn't play baseball.

728
00:53:36,297 --> 00:53:37,132
I missed.

729
00:53:40,901 --> 00:53:42,035
Okay okay, alright.

730
00:53:42,037 --> 00:53:44,539
[loud scream]

731
00:53:45,973 --> 00:53:48,543
[ghostly wind]

732
00:54:10,498 --> 00:54:13,501
Can we at least
put on some pants?

733
00:54:39,026 --> 00:54:40,761
Find her, kill her.

734
00:54:42,297 --> 00:54:45,066
Shawn?
[creaking]

735
00:54:46,667 --> 00:54:47,935
Don't ask me.

736
00:54:48,936 --> 00:54:49,770
Ask her.

737
00:54:52,540 --> 00:54:54,273
No I mean when we find her

738
00:54:54,275 --> 00:54:57,610
how are we supposed to kill her?

739
00:54:57,612 --> 00:54:58,879
I don't know.

740
00:55:00,047 --> 00:55:01,447
Why are you asking
me these questions?

741
00:55:01,449 --> 00:55:04,285
You never ask me
these questions."

00:57:18,653 --> 00:57:19,487
Nope.

763
00:57:20,521 --> 00:57:21,522
I missed it.

764
00:57:23,023 --> 00:57:24,925

that

776
00:58:28,389 --> 00:58:29,624
came from that?

777
00:58:40,167 --> 00:58:42,002
I don't give a damn.

778
00:58:43,338 --> 00:58:45,840
I'm just gonna kill the bitch.

779
00:58:48,075 --> 00:58:48,974
Hey Jake.

Yeah?

781
00:58:52,380 --> 00:58:54,547
Can I talk to you
alone for a minute?

782
00:58:54,549 --> 00:58:55,383
Okay.

783
00:58:57,117 --> 00:58:58,118
No, alone.

784
00:59:00,388 --> 00:59:01,920

know, I can't see.

792
00:59:36,724 --> 00:59:39,257
[Jake] Why are
you so far away?

793
00:59:39,259 --> 00:59:41,760
[Shawn] The lights went off.

794
00:59:41,762 --> 00:59:45,664
You should be asking me
why I would stick around.

795
00:59:45,666 --> 00:59:49,034
[Jake] Okay,
well start clapping

796
00:59:49,036 --> 00:59:51,570

Shawn?

826
01:05:38,685 --> 01:05:39,519
Shawn?

Shawn?

Yeah.

832
01:06:18,025 --> 01:06:19,124
What happened?

833
01:06:19,126 --> 01:06:21,126
Where were you?

834
01:06:21,128 --> 01:06:23,261
I hid in the bathroom.

835
01:06:23,263 --> 01:06:26,098
You didn't hear all
that happened to me?

836
01:06:26,100 --> 01:06:29,203
Would you feel
better if I said no?

837

842
01:07:52,953 --> 01:07:53,787
Find her

843
01:07:55,489 --> 01:07:56,323
kill her.

844
01:08:07,667 --> 01:08:10,170
You want us to find you girls.

845
01:08:34,361 --> 01:08:35,429
Release Jacob

846
01:08:38,032 --> 01:08:40,100
and we'll find you girls.

847
01:09:01,655 --> 01:09:04,324

[loud thud]

849
01:09:46,666 --> 01:09:47,734
Is it over?

850
01:09:51,972 --> 01:09:54,072
I did something bad.

851
01:09:54,074 --> 01:09:56,843
[rhythmic thuds]

852
01:10:01,215 --> 01:10:03,483

853
01:10:17,631 --> 01:10:19,097
Jake.

854
01:10:19,099 --> 01:10:20,200
I got a plan.

855
01:10:23,770 --> 01:10:25,772
Why don't we just run?

856
01:10:26,940 --> 01:10:30,110
Oh yeah, let's say
that a bit louder!

857
01:10:32,246 --> 01:10:35,480
Like I planned that last
night when I said it.

858
01:10:35,482 --> 01:10:38,250
You think I really want
to go hunt down girls

859
01:10:38,252 --> 01:10:42,422
for that stupid doll for a
Little Shop of Horrors scenario?

860
01:10:43,490 --> 01:10:46,258
How are we gonna leave?

861
01:10:46,260 --> 01:10:48,960
What we do is we play it cool.

862
01:10:48,962 --> 01:10:50,262
Alright?

863
01:10:50,264 --> 01:10:52,764
We just act like we're
gonna go get the goods

864
01:10:52,766 --> 01:10:54,366
and then just run like hell.

865
01:10:54,368 --> 01:10:56,401
Convert everything.

866
01:10:56,403 --> 01:10:59,337
Hell, I'll do
Scientology if I have to.

867
01:10:59,339 --> 01:11:00,474
Scientology?

868
01:11:01,641 --> 01:11:02,874
I'm desperate Jake.

869
01:11:02,876 --> 01:11:03,710
Hail Xenu.

870
01:11:04,744 --> 01:11:05,943
It's already happening.

871
01:11:05,945 --> 01:11:06,780
Okay.

872
01:11:07,647 --> 01:11:08,913
You ready?

873
01:11:08,915 --> 01:11:09,749
Yeah.

874
01:11:11,485 --> 01:11:13,820
[loud yawn]

875
01:11:15,189 --> 01:11:18,523
Look at that
Shawn we are awake.

876
01:11:18,525 --> 01:11:21,295
Let us go and get
us some females

877
01:11:23,297 --> 01:11:26,398
and sacrifice them to the doll.

878
01:11:26,400 --> 01:11:27,899
You're right!

879
01:11:27,901 --> 01:11:30,935
That is something I have
wanted to do for so long.

880
01:11:30,937 --> 01:11:32,470
Who doesn't like
starting out their day

881
01:11:32,472 --> 01:11:34,308
with a good sacrifice?

882
01:11:44,618 --> 01:11:46,886
[laughter]

883
01:11:47,854 --> 01:11:49,387
Yeah!

884
01:11:49,389 --> 01:11:53,057
I guess we'll be off to
go and get those girls now.

885
01:11:53,059 --> 01:11:54,459
Oh yes!

886
01:11:54,461 --> 01:11:55,795
Mmm mm mmm good!

887
01:11:56,663 --> 01:11:59,333
[ominous music]

888
01:12:05,239 --> 01:12:08,142
[fast paced music]

889
01:12:21,788 --> 01:12:23,388
This way!

890
01:12:23,390 --> 01:12:24,224
Come on!

891
01:13:32,526 --> 01:13:34,861
[loud yell]

892
01:13:38,465 --> 01:13:40,967
[Jake] What are we gonna do?

893
01:13:42,902 --> 01:13:44,238
We're leaving.

894
01:13:45,104 --> 01:13:46,938
That's what we're gonna do.

895
01:13:46,940 --> 01:13:49,509
What are we really gonna do!?

896
01:13:53,146 --> 01:13:54,414
I don't know.

897
01:14:04,123 --> 01:14:06,726
You said you'd give it girls.

898
01:14:10,063 --> 01:14:10,897
We.

899
01:14:12,198 --> 01:14:13,032
What?!

900
01:14:16,236 --> 01:14:18,338
We made a deal with it.

901
01:14:21,741 --> 01:14:23,076
You're included.

902
01:14:25,879 --> 01:14:27,945
Okay, we will get a girl.

903
01:14:27,947 --> 01:14:30,016
That's what you told it?!

904
01:14:38,692 --> 01:14:40,858
We have to do something.

905
01:14:40,860 --> 01:14:42,195
Do something?!

906
01:14:43,062 --> 01:14:43,897
We go!

907
01:14:45,599 --> 01:14:47,265
Others have!

908
01:14:47,267 --> 01:14:48,935
Those were haunts.

909
01:14:50,837 --> 01:14:52,839
You made a deal with it.

910
01:14:55,909 --> 01:14:59,611
It's not some kind of
paranormal king pin Jake!

911
01:14:59,613 --> 01:15:01,214
It's a fucking doll!

912
01:15:02,115 --> 01:15:03,715
You know as much as I do.

913
01:15:03,717 --> 01:15:05,850
We both don't know!

914
01:15:05,852 --> 01:15:06,686
But,

915
01:15:08,855 --> 01:15:10,857
you made a deal with it,

916
01:15:12,359 --> 01:15:14,027
that's a commitment.

917
01:15:15,395 --> 01:15:18,129
What that means to
it, I don't know.

918
01:15:18,131 --> 01:15:18,965
Okay.

919
01:15:24,037 --> 01:15:26,139
Alright, we just give up.

920
01:15:28,107 --> 01:15:30,241
We tell it we can't do it.

921
01:15:30,243 --> 01:15:33,747
It's a doll, we just
cant do what it asks.

922
01:15:36,115 --> 01:15:38,718
I don't think it's that easy.

923
01:15:41,721 --> 01:15:42,556
So what?

924
01:15:43,823 --> 01:15:44,991
What do we do?

925
01:15:50,830 --> 01:15:52,666
We need to kill her.

926
01:15:53,800 --> 01:15:57,003
Well, exorcize or
whatever you call it.

927
01:16:02,308 --> 01:16:06,480
So you've been taking
priestly classes behind my back?

928
01:16:12,051 --> 01:16:12,886
Hey.

929
01:16:15,154 --> 01:16:17,056
We need a professional.

930
01:16:21,194 --> 01:16:24,598
Oh yeah, a professional
ghost expeller!

931
01:16:25,765 --> 01:16:29,403
Woo, where are we gonna
find that, Craigslist?

932
01:16:31,304 --> 01:16:32,572
Or a psychic.

933
01:16:46,019 --> 01:16:46,853
Okay.

934
01:16:51,825 --> 01:16:54,225
Where do we find one of those?

935
01:16:54,227 --> 01:16:56,027
[ominous music]

936
01:16:56,029 --> 01:16:58,496
It just sounds so stupid to me.

937
01:16:58,498 --> 01:17:01,766
I cant believe that your
even suggesting that.

938
01:17:01,768 --> 01:17:04,469
So you really want
the whole plan to be

939
01:17:04,471 --> 01:17:07,306
where all we do
is say hey listen,

940
01:17:09,075 --> 01:17:12,746
we were attacked by a
doll, people are dead.

941
01:17:14,280 --> 01:17:17,348
I mean, whose gonna believe us?

942
01:17:17,350 --> 01:17:21,521
She's gonna believe us
because of her psychic-ness?

943
01:17:22,388 --> 01:17:24,323
It's the best we got.

944
01:17:29,729 --> 01:17:30,564
Okay.

945
01:17:31,531 --> 01:17:34,133
[upbeat music]

946
01:17:39,506 --> 01:17:42,442
[slow paced music]

947
01:17:50,650 --> 01:17:52,850
So, how may I help you?

948
01:17:52,852 --> 01:17:53,687
Wait.

949
01:17:55,655 --> 01:17:57,491
I'm sensing something.

950
01:17:58,592 --> 01:18:00,291
You want something.

951
01:18:00,293 --> 01:18:01,526
Alright, she's just
gonna pee wee out.

952
01:18:01,528 --> 01:18:03,427
Shh, Shawn.

953
01:18:03,429 --> 01:18:04,263
Yes we do.

954
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:09,669
Do you do like paranormal stuff?

955
01:18:11,838 --> 01:18:13,339
Paranormal work?

956
01:18:14,974 --> 01:18:16,409
Ghosts, demons,

957
01:18:17,611 --> 01:18:18,910
I don't know possessed dolls.

958
01:18:18,912 --> 01:18:20,077
I'm just throwing it all out.

959
01:18:20,079 --> 01:18:22,181
Yeah, things like that.

960
01:18:25,485 --> 01:18:28,152
Is this ghost
here with you now?

961
01:18:28,154 --> 01:18:29,854
No, it's back at the house.

962
01:18:29,856 --> 01:18:32,824
You're not sensing
its power are you?

963
01:18:32,826 --> 01:18:33,825
Yes.

964
01:18:33,827 --> 01:18:35,059
Yes I do.

965
01:18:35,061 --> 01:18:37,463
Oh it's power is very strong.

966
01:18:39,566 --> 01:18:42,233
How is it affecting you?

967
01:18:42,235 --> 01:18:46,337
Bit me in the arm,
hurt my leg, threw him.

968
01:18:46,339 --> 01:18:48,940
Plus it killed two people.

969
01:18:48,942 --> 01:18:50,174
Allegedly.

970
01:18:50,176 --> 01:18:52,744
We don't know they're dead yet.

971
01:18:52,746 --> 01:18:55,547
Killed somebody, you said?

972
01:18:55,549 --> 01:18:56,550
Allegedly.

973
01:19:01,154 --> 01:19:03,420
Excuse me for one minute.

974
01:19:03,422 --> 01:19:06,123
Please, make yourself at home.

975
01:19:06,125 --> 01:19:08,960
Have a seat, I'll be right back.

976
01:19:08,962 --> 01:19:10,363
Take your time.

977
01:19:16,670 --> 01:19:19,136
Yes, I have two
guys here that are

978
01:19:19,138 --> 01:19:22,439
talking about
murdering somebody.

979
01:19:22,441 --> 01:19:23,608
[Shawn] What do you
think she's doing?

980
01:19:23,610 --> 01:19:24,942
I don't know
maybe making us tea.

981
01:19:24,944 --> 01:19:27,979
What do psychics don't
normally leave the room.

982
01:19:27,981 --> 01:19:31,417
Yeah, I know that's
why I'm asking you.

983
01:19:33,987 --> 01:19:36,420
I think she's
calling the police.

984
01:19:36,422 --> 01:19:39,056
No, can you please
get here quickly?

985
01:19:39,058 --> 01:19:41,058
[ominous music]

986
01:19:41,060 --> 01:19:42,359
Dude she's calling the cops.

987
01:19:42,361 --> 01:19:43,294
Well that's not good.

988
01:19:43,296 --> 01:19:44,796
What are we supposed to do?

989
01:19:44,798 --> 01:19:47,899
I don't know
this was your plan.

990
01:19:47,901 --> 01:19:51,202
Okay, I mean I'll stall
them as long as I can.

991
01:19:51,204 --> 01:19:52,038
Okay.

992
01:19:55,274 --> 01:19:57,508

994
01:19:59,178 --> 01:20:00,678
What are you doing Shawn?

995
01:20:00,680 --> 01:20:01,646
[Psychic] I already
called the cops!

996
01:20:01,648 --> 01:20:02,916
I'm doing it!

997
01:20:05,018 --> 01:20:05,883
[Jake] Are you okay?

998
01:20:05,885 --> 01:20:06,884
No!

999
01:20:06,886 --> 01:20:08,052
[Jake] What are you doing?

1000
01:20:08,054 --> 01:20:09,821
I'm sticking
with the damn plan.

1001
01:20:09,823 --> 01:20:13,257
You're not gonna
get away with this!

1002
01:20:13,259 --> 01:20:14,093
Hurry.

1003
01:20:14,961 --> 01:20:16,761
[loud crack]

1004

[ominous music]

1005
01:20:21,134 --> 01:20:22,802
She's finally awake.

1006
01:20:25,138 --> 01:20:27,972
We're really sorry
about all this.

1007
01:20:27,974 --> 01:20:31,075
But, we're serious about
what is going on here.

1008
01:20:31,077 --> 01:20:33,913
We also need your
expert guidance.

1009
01:20:36,750 --> 01:20:38,515
Believe it or not,

1010
01:20:38,517 --> 01:20:41,454
we don't know how
to expel a ghost.

1011
01:20:42,521 --> 01:20:46,057
Well, not
professionally that is.

1012
01:20:46,059 --> 01:20:47,961
Can I remove the gag?

1013
01:20:51,998 --> 01:20:53,530
Careful.

1014
01:20:53,532 --> 01:20:54,968
Could be a trick.

1015
01:20:57,303 --> 01:21:00,938
How else do you expect
her to expel a ghost Shawn?

1016
01:21:00,940 --> 01:21:02,506
What are you talking about?

1017
01:21:02,508 --> 01:21:04,341
She's psychic.

1018
01:21:04,343 --> 01:21:05,511
With her mind.

[Shawn] What?

1022
01:21:43,717 --> 01:21:45,282
Do you remember those possession
movies where you had to

1023
01:21:45,284 --> 01:21:49,088
stab somebody so many times
and then light them on fire?

1024
01:21:50,589 --> 01:21:54,393
I'm gonna say yes to avoid
any arguments, but yeah why?

1025
01:21:55,895 --> 01:21:57,163
I don't know.

1026
01:21:58,765 --> 01:22:01,866
Just thinking of a back up plan.

1027
01:22:01,868 --> 01:22:02,936
Just in case.

1028
01:22:03,870 --> 01:22:05,469

I'm just spit-ballin' here but

1042
01:25:17,163 --> 01:25:21,267
do you think we actually
did what it asked of us.

[suspenseful music]

1044
01:25:30,977 --> 01:25:31,810

1066
01:27:05,138 --> 01:27:06,137
Did you see what happened?

1067
01:27:06,139 --> 01:27:07,304

all over the doll?

[Jake] I don't think
he's gonna notice.

1102
01:33:21,914 --> 01:33:23,947
[Shawn] Hey so
I've been thinking,

1103
01:33:23,949 --> 01:33:25,649
we should do this
as a profession.

1104
01:33:25,651 --> 01:33:27,250
[Jake] We're pretty
good at it aren't we?

1105
01:33:27,252 --> 01:33:28,151
[Shawn] Yeah.

1106
01:33:28,153 --> 01:33:29,386
[Jake] Yeah.

1107
01:33:29,388 --> 01:33:30,320
[Shawn] Alright
so what would we do?

1108
01:33:30,322 --> 01:33:32,589
We would umm, I don't know
