1
00:02:18,446 --> 00:02:21,828
Come on, Carl!

2
00:02:34,295 --> 00:02:36,675
7-IDA-06 over at Hal's Tire Shop.

3
00:02:36,831 --> 00:02:39,040
There's been a break-in.

4
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,738
06 en route to the tire shop.

5
00:03:18,541 --> 00:03:20,715
I found her.
She was out here by the shed

6
00:03:20,876 --> 00:03:23,187
and she was just
lying on the ground.

7
00:03:23,344 --> 00:03:26,057
And I could tell she was dead
the second I saw her.

8
00:03:26,217 --> 00:03:28,459
And, um, I just don't get it.

9
00:03:33,554 --> 00:03:36,630
We're not used to things like this
happening in this neighborhood.

10
00:03:41,129 --> 00:03:42,940
I just can't believe
there was anybody that--

11
00:03:43,098 --> 00:03:44,581
- Hey, how you doin'?
- Hey.

12
00:03:44,735 --> 00:03:46,113
So, do you know this girl?

13
00:03:46,270 --> 00:03:48,752
- No. So sad.
- Anyone else been around here?

14
00:03:48,907 --> 00:03:50,717
Oh, yeah, my uncle George--

15
00:03:50,875 --> 00:03:52,252
he lives across the street--
he was here.

16
00:03:52,409 --> 00:03:54,551
His wife Arlene called the police

17
00:03:54,713 --> 00:03:56,921
and then my sister Bonnie
came over with the twins.

18
00:03:57,081 --> 00:03:59,154
And there have been
a lot of people over here.

19
00:03:59,316 --> 00:04:01,559
- A little regular family picnic, huh?
- People are curious.

20
00:04:01,718 --> 00:04:03,998
I want you to stay here with
the officer. Don't go nowhere.

21
00:04:04,156 --> 00:04:06,159
- Oh, okay.
- Ma'am, right this way.

22
00:04:08,725 --> 00:04:11,231
- You wanna run that tape back 10 feet?
- Yes, sir.

23
00:04:14,064 --> 00:04:16,012
How long do you think she's been
trampling on the crime scene?

24
00:04:16,167 --> 00:04:17,909
Too long.

25
00:04:20,904 --> 00:04:23,286
No obvious blood.

26
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:24,920
Lots of trauma.

27
00:04:25,075 --> 00:04:27,284
Look at her knees.

28
00:04:27,445 --> 00:04:30,086
Toes are scraped.
There's no drag marks.

29
00:05:06,618 --> 00:05:08,122
No rigor.

30
00:05:08,286 --> 00:05:10,528
It's probably under two hours.

31
00:05:10,689 --> 00:05:12,467
It didn't happen here.

32
00:05:17,561 --> 00:05:19,737
Wanna wait for Crime Scene
before you start dicking with the body?

33
00:05:19,898 --> 00:05:21,243
It's gonna rain.

34
00:05:24,971 --> 00:05:26,645
I'll go run tape
and try to keep

35
00:05:26,805 --> 00:05:28,717
this thundering herd
off the rest of the evidence.

36
00:05:28,874 --> 00:05:32,415
Hey, princess!
Go get me a tarp.

37
00:05:37,581 --> 00:05:39,327
She's fuckin' sitting
on a pile of pissants.

38
00:05:39,487 --> 00:05:41,162
Yeah.

39
00:05:41,322 --> 00:05:43,826
What's that? Gray fiber?

40
00:06:11,884 --> 00:06:14,025
Any of you clowns call Crime Scene?

41
00:06:16,623 --> 00:06:19,128
Hail Mary, full of grace,
the Lord is with thee;

42
00:06:19,293 --> 00:06:21,036
blessed art thou
amongst women,

43
00:06:21,194 --> 00:06:23,540
and blessed is the fruit
of thy womb, Jesus...

44
00:06:23,697 --> 00:06:25,041
Brian.

45
00:06:25,198 --> 00:06:28,546
...Pray for us sinners,
now and at the hour of our death.

46
00:06:28,702 --> 00:06:31,207
Amen.

47
00:06:48,823 --> 00:06:50,429
Hey!

48
00:06:51,993 --> 00:06:54,167
Come here.

49
00:06:59,734 --> 00:07:01,409
What's in the bag?

50
00:07:01,570 --> 00:07:03,573
I knew you'd find me.

51
00:07:03,738 --> 00:07:06,482
It's not a game, Anne.
What's in the bag?

52
00:07:06,642 --> 00:07:09,590
Milk of magnesia.
I get stomachaches.

53
00:07:09,744 --> 00:07:12,089
All right, get in.

54
00:07:16,618 --> 00:07:19,624
You're on juvie probation.
You're supposed to be home.

55
00:07:19,787 --> 00:07:22,269
My mom says don't come home
till the porch light's out.

56
00:07:22,423 --> 00:07:25,498
- So you can talk to her.
- She still got all the boyfriends?

57
00:07:25,661 --> 00:07:27,801
Ain't you the one
with all the boyfriends?

58
00:07:30,797 --> 00:07:33,784
I got diamonds put on each finger.
Aren't they pretty?

59
00:07:33,938 --> 00:07:35,681
That's real nice.

60
00:08:19,815 --> 00:08:21,660
I'm pushing the damn thing!

61
00:08:21,818 --> 00:08:24,665
Every time I go--

62
00:08:33,932 --> 00:08:35,344
How you doin', Lucie?

63
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:37,777
I'm all right.

64
00:08:37,936 --> 00:08:40,611
You and I both know she's on probation.
What's she doing out?

65
00:08:41,672 --> 00:08:43,550
She don't come home from school.

66
00:08:43,708 --> 00:08:45,449
So what you're telling me
is you want her to come home

67
00:08:45,610 --> 00:08:47,021
right after school, right?

68
00:08:47,177 --> 00:08:48,852
Yeah, of course.

69
00:08:49,013 --> 00:08:51,190
- You hear that?
- Yeah, I heard it.

70
00:08:51,350 --> 00:08:53,729
All right, I'm gonna be
coming by here from time to time,

71
00:08:53,884 --> 00:08:55,957
make sure she's home, okay?

72
00:08:57,122 --> 00:09:00,903
I can call you
when she doesn't show up.

73
00:09:01,059 --> 00:09:04,405
You don't need to be wasting
your time on us, Officer Brian.

74
00:09:07,598 --> 00:09:10,309
Come on, honey.
Supper's on.

75
00:09:11,302 --> 00:09:13,375
Mike.

76
00:09:13,537 --> 00:09:16,884
Just wait over here by the car.
Don't move.

77
00:09:17,041 --> 00:09:18,886
You been warned, princess

78
00:09:19,043 --> 00:09:20,717
Come on, ladies!

79
00:09:20,878 --> 00:09:22,381
Let's go.

80
00:09:22,545 --> 00:09:25,050
I told you.
Let's go home. Come on.

81
00:09:25,215 --> 00:09:28,225
Hey! Come on, everyone.
Move.

82
00:09:30,224 --> 00:09:31,829
You got a wife and two kids, boy.

83
00:09:31,991 --> 00:09:34,908
Come on up here, guys.
Against the truck, please.

84
00:09:35,062 --> 00:09:37,009
Come on, keep going.
Keep going.

85
00:09:38,164 --> 00:09:40,008
What'd I do?

86
00:09:51,843 --> 00:09:55,420
- What'd you just say?
- What'd I do?

87
00:09:57,750 --> 00:10:00,789
So, were you waiting in line
for a blow job or giving them?

88
00:10:06,292 --> 00:10:08,000
ID.

89
00:10:10,863 --> 00:10:13,311
You, too, dipshit.

90
00:10:24,712 --> 00:10:27,457
Now, why don't I call
personnel at the plant,

91
00:10:27,615 --> 00:10:29,960
have you move on
down the road?

92
00:10:32,453 --> 00:10:34,730
Nah.

93
00:10:34,888 --> 00:10:36,892
I like it here.

94
00:10:39,627 --> 00:10:41,630
What you doin', brother?

95
00:10:43,130 --> 00:10:45,808
- Just taking out the garbage.
- Mm-hmm.

96
00:10:45,967 --> 00:10:49,247
This one here--
that's Lucie's son.

97
00:10:49,404 --> 00:10:52,818
Yeah, he's probably banging her, too.

98
00:10:52,973 --> 00:10:54,749
Go on inside.

99
00:10:56,310 --> 00:10:57,984
What, your daddy drop you
on your fuckin' head or something?

100
00:10:58,145 --> 00:10:59,750
Get in.

101
00:11:14,595 --> 00:11:18,171
If it gets bad around here,
you call me, okay?

102
00:11:20,067 --> 00:11:22,347
Come on in the house now, baby.

103
00:11:22,504 --> 00:11:24,042
You come on in the house now.

104
00:11:25,342 --> 00:11:27,015
Come on.

105
00:11:29,346 --> 00:11:31,850
You just made it worse
for that little girl.

106
00:11:32,848 --> 00:11:34,761
Social work ain't gonna
save her, Brian.

107
00:11:56,638 --> 00:11:58,381
This is Detective Heigh.

108
00:11:58,541 --> 00:12:00,249
Hey, Brian, this is Pam.

109
00:12:00,409 --> 00:12:02,617
Listen, hon, we got a girl
gone missing over here.

110
00:12:02,777 --> 00:12:06,228
- How long missing?
- 26 hours and no leads.

111
00:12:06,382 --> 00:12:09,332
It's a- a new...

112
00:12:10,752 --> 00:12:13,429
light green Toyota,
Texas plate-- GHY.

113
00:12:13,588 --> 00:12:15,900
The girl's name is Kirsten Laine.

114
00:12:16,057 --> 00:12:17,665
You got your command post
up yet?

115
00:12:17,828 --> 00:12:20,070
Yeah, real soon. I'm gonna
call this in to your duty officer

116
00:12:20,230 --> 00:12:23,272
'cause, listen, hon, I could really use
your help around here.

117
00:12:23,434 --> 00:12:25,244
Yeah, Pam, I can't do that.

118
00:12:25,402 --> 00:12:26,974
How come?

119
00:12:27,138 --> 00:12:29,346
We got a homicide of our own
over here.

120
00:12:29,505 --> 00:12:31,853
Female, blonde, well-dressed?

121
00:12:32,009 --> 00:12:34,684
Female, probably a street kid,
dark hair.

122
00:12:34,844 --> 00:12:36,256
Oh, come on, now.

123
00:12:36,412 --> 00:12:39,124
Why don't you leave the early work
to that ace detective partner of yours

124
00:12:39,283 --> 00:12:40,661
and help me out?

125
00:12:40,818 --> 00:12:42,264
After all, he is the best.

126
00:12:42,419 --> 00:12:44,958
There ain't a woman in the world
who don't love how I do it, sugar.

127
00:12:45,122 --> 00:12:47,798
Okay? So, now,
don't try phoning our chief,

128
00:12:47,957 --> 00:12:49,836
trying to pull some strings
and all that other kind of horseshit.

129
00:12:49,994 --> 00:12:51,372
Take me off speaker.

130
00:12:51,528 --> 00:12:52,769
Pam.

131
00:12:52,929 --> 00:12:54,340
Would you request your partner
not continue to be

132
00:12:54,496 --> 00:12:56,606
the asshole he was
when I was married to him?

133
00:12:56,768 --> 00:12:58,715
They're just going to
refuse you permission.

134
00:12:58,869 --> 00:13:00,782
'Cause of last time.

135
00:13:00,938 --> 00:13:03,112
I cannot go
into your jurisdiction again

136
00:13:03,273 --> 00:13:04,947
Your captain's going
to call my captain,

137
00:13:05,108 --> 00:13:07,647
and he's going to unload about
how many hours and money they spent

138
00:13:07,811 --> 00:13:09,621
on me working
on other counties' cases.

139
00:13:10,679 --> 00:13:13,321
Listen, Bri, this is looking
like a real stinker.

140
00:13:13,482 --> 00:13:15,364
We just located the car.

141
00:13:15,521 --> 00:13:17,296
Where?

142
00:13:17,457 --> 00:13:19,529
It's in the fields.

143
00:13:24,696 --> 00:13:27,542
All right, right now what you have
is a missing person.

144
00:13:27,698 --> 00:13:30,510
If you find a body-

145
00:13:30,668 --> 00:13:32,981
if you find a body,
you call me right away.

146
00:13:35,308 --> 00:13:37,721
Thank you, hon.

147
00:13:42,315 --> 00:13:46,528
See, my daddy always said,
"Sometimes you get;

148
00:13:46,685 --> 00:13:48,688
sometimes you get got."

149
00:13:50,755 --> 00:13:53,398
I'll let you suss out
what just happened to you.

150
00:14:10,508 --> 00:14:13,016
Clark County Sheriff’s Office...

151
00:14:19,752 --> 00:14:21,631
- This is the area where six bodies...
- Come on, boy.

152
00:14:21,788 --> 00:14:24,533
- ...Since 1970 have been found.
- Easy.

153
00:14:25,926 --> 00:14:27,599
Damn it.

154
00:14:33,033 --> 00:14:34,638
Say it ain't so.

155
00:14:34,802 --> 00:14:36,544
Ma'am, can I see some ID?

156
00:14:36,702 --> 00:14:38,877
Can I see some ID, please?

157
00:14:39,038 --> 00:14:41,076
Why, yes, Officer, of course.

158
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:42,652
By the way, you the one
selling tickets here?

159
00:14:42,809 --> 00:14:44,722
'Cause I'd sure as hell
like to buy one.

160
00:14:44,877 --> 00:14:47,587
Detective Stall. You think maybe
you could do me a little favor

161
00:14:47,746 --> 00:14:49,990
and get every asshole
off my crime scene right now?

162
00:14:50,149 --> 00:14:51,789
While you're at it, why don't you
go ahead and make a list

163
00:14:51,952 --> 00:14:54,561
of everybody whose footprints,
fingerprints, tire prints,

164
00:14:54,721 --> 00:14:58,569
and hoof prints I might find on top
of the real goddamn evidence?

165
00:14:58,724 --> 00:15:00,729
- Back up!
- Eddie, come on.

166
00:15:00,894 --> 00:15:03,569
- Get that fuckin' horse out of here.
- You heard her!

167
00:15:03,728 --> 00:15:05,731
Where the hell is CSI?

168
00:15:29,358 --> 00:15:34,938
# Look on down from the bridge #

169
00:15:35,097 --> 00:15:39,878
# There's still fountains #

170
00:15:40,033 --> 00:15:42,642
# Down there #

171
00:15:45,472 --> 00:15:51,291
# Look on down from the bridge #

172
00:15:51,445 --> 00:15:55,728
# It's still raining #

173
00:15:55,884 --> 00:15:58,890
# Up here... #

174
00:15:59,052 --> 00:16:01,126
Lee!

175
00:16:01,289 --> 00:16:07,042
# Everybody seems
so far away from me #

176
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:15,377
# Everybody just wants to be free #

177
00:16:17,206 --> 00:16:22,854
# Look away from the sky #

178
00:16:23,012 --> 00:16:26,429
# It's no different #

179
00:16:26,583 --> 00:16:29,327
# When you're leaving home #

180
00:16:33,088 --> 00:16:38,668
# I can't be the same thing
to you now #

181
00:16:38,827 --> 00:16:42,106
# I'm just gone #

182
00:16:43,332 --> 00:16:46,077
# Just gone... #

183
00:16:46,235 --> 00:16:48,718
- Hi, sweetie.
- Hi.

184
00:16:49,705 --> 00:16:51,083
Okay day?

185
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:53,950
It was okay.

186
00:16:56,446 --> 00:17:00,898
# How could I say good... #

187
00:17:04,189 --> 00:17:06,569
You better slow down on that 40.

188
00:17:10,094 --> 00:17:11,701
Shit.

189
00:17:11,863 --> 00:17:13,206
The 5-0.

190
00:17:15,866 --> 00:17:18,075
- What's up, B?
- Hey, how are you?

191
00:17:18,234 --> 00:17:20,375
- How's everybody today?
- All right.

192
00:17:20,537 --> 00:17:22,712
- Staying out of the heat?
- Tryin'.

193
00:17:22,874 --> 00:17:25,719
- Lady Worm, how are you?
- What you got?

194
00:17:25,876 --> 00:17:28,324
I got to show you guys something.
I need you to take a look

195
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:30,427
and let me know if you've seen
this little girl before.

196
00:17:30,582 --> 00:17:32,061
Mm-hmm.

197
00:17:32,215 --> 00:17:34,994
- He came right up here to the house.
- Sheila.

198
00:17:39,089 --> 00:17:41,436
What happened to your hand, Sheila?

199
00:17:41,592 --> 00:17:43,300
35 stitches.

200
00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:45,065
Doctor taking them out tomorrow.

201
00:17:45,228 --> 00:17:47,233
Her sister's boyfriend's
pit bull got her.

202
00:17:48,566 --> 00:17:49,807
I should have stayed out of the yard,

203
00:17:49,967 --> 00:17:51,573
but they told me the dog
was locked up.

204
00:17:51,736 --> 00:17:53,910
- I told you they didn't lock that gate.
- They told you.

205
00:17:54,070 --> 00:17:56,074
Anyway, he came right up here
to the house asking about her.

206
00:17:56,239 --> 00:17:57,948
Who's "he"?

207
00:17:58,109 --> 00:17:59,680
- Levon.
- Sheila.

208
00:17:59,846 --> 00:18:01,827
- Levon.
- See...

209
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:05,090
Did you know that they crossed
a pit bull with a shih tzu?

210
00:18:05,251 --> 00:18:07,596
What the hell is a shih tzu?
What are you talking about?

211
00:18:07,753 --> 00:18:09,996
One of them little Chinese dogs, man-
one of them little bitty dogs.

212
00:18:10,155 --> 00:18:11,829
That must have hurt.

213
00:18:13,525 --> 00:18:15,837
- It's called a bullshit.
- You--

214
00:18:15,995 --> 00:18:17,474
Are you gonna ask her
if it's one of her girls or what?

215
00:18:17,628 --> 00:18:18,630
Or you just gonna read 'em
a bedtime story?

216
00:18:18,796 --> 00:18:20,710
That's all you about, is bullshit.
You all bullshit.

217
00:18:20,868 --> 00:18:23,008
- Come on.
- That's all you about.

218
00:18:23,169 --> 00:18:25,948
I'm gonna go see a man
about a man.

219
00:18:26,105 --> 00:18:28,609
Check with CSI.
I'll meet you there.

220
00:18:28,774 --> 00:18:30,619
All right, let's go back,
talk about this girl.

221
00:18:30,776 --> 00:18:32,155
She's about 15 years old,

222
00:18:32,311 --> 00:18:34,383
just a little crack ho from up north--

223
00:18:34,546 --> 00:18:37,325
Dallas or somewhere.

224
00:18:37,482 --> 00:18:38,896
We called her the Little Debbie

225
00:18:39,053 --> 00:18:41,728
She stayed everywhere,
slept where she could,

226
00:18:41,887 --> 00:18:44,495
- sometimes over at Reba's shelter.
- Really?

227
00:18:44,657 --> 00:18:46,865
And them boys
ain't scared of nobody.

228
00:18:48,461 --> 00:18:51,136
And the scary one
is the white dude.

229
00:19:26,867 --> 00:19:29,748
Yo, which way be Edwards Street?

230
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:36,586
- Say, you want a ride?
- I'm good.

231
00:19:36,744 --> 00:19:39,351
Come on, you sure look like
you could use a ride.

232
00:19:41,415 --> 00:19:43,225
Don't be teasing me now, girl.

233
00:19:58,434 --> 00:20:01,144
- Lunchtime.
- All right, you good now, boys.

234
00:20:06,308 --> 00:20:08,221
How you doin"?

235
00:20:09,878 --> 00:20:12,383
I'm Brian-
Texas City Police Department.

236
00:20:12,547 --> 00:20:14,552
I know your daddy.

237
00:20:14,717 --> 00:20:17,222
Don't look at her.
Look at me.

238
00:20:18,454 --> 00:20:21,403
I'm extending my hand here.
You should shake it.

239
00:20:23,056 --> 00:20:25,631
- I'm not from here.
- You got any ID?

240
00:20:31,499 --> 00:20:33,413
You seen this girl,

241
00:20:33,569 --> 00:20:35,743
Levon Chalmers?

242
00:20:35,904 --> 00:20:38,079
She came to me,

243
00:20:38,239 --> 00:20:40,585
said a guy was following her,
giving her the fix.

244
00:20:40,742 --> 00:20:43,487
I even think I seen him once.

245
00:20:43,645 --> 00:20:46,149
You know her name?

246
00:20:46,314 --> 00:20:47,952
Not really.

247
00:20:48,115 --> 00:20:49,494
- Not really?
- No.

248
00:20:49,650 --> 00:20:51,601
Why don't you ask him
what he call her?

249
00:21:04,867 --> 00:21:06,780
All right, Levon, I need you
to come down to the station

250
00:21:06,936 --> 00:21:09,818
and talk to me and my partner,
look at some pictures.

251
00:21:09,972 --> 00:21:12,785
I'll give you my card.

252
00:21:12,944 --> 00:21:16,325
You get lost or you need a ride,

253
00:21:16,479 --> 00:21:18,518
use that card
and you call me, okay?

254
00:21:18,683 --> 00:21:20,060
Most definitely.

255
00:21:20,216 --> 00:21:22,631
Most definitely.
I'll see you soon.

256
00:21:22,786 --> 00:21:24,733
All right.

257
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:32,034
Of course, it's only been
a few weeks,

258
00:21:32,195 --> 00:21:34,144
but he has been
a good employee, though.

259
00:21:34,298 --> 00:21:36,040
No problems.

260
00:22:11,203 --> 00:22:13,514
Every time some little bitch
gets her period,

261
00:22:13,671 --> 00:22:15,676
y'all gotta drag my ass in here?

262
00:22:15,841 --> 00:22:18,551
Bet that one right there
is on the rag.

263
00:22:18,709 --> 00:22:21,021
Bring him in first.

264
00:22:21,178 --> 00:22:23,421
Can we sit in?

265
00:22:23,581 --> 00:22:26,930
Okay, but don't talk,
don't smile,

266
00:22:27,086 --> 00:22:29,465
don't even blink
if he looks at you.

267
00:22:57,650 --> 00:22:59,996
What are you doing for women
these days, Salter?

268
00:23:01,555 --> 00:23:03,125
Don't look at him.

269
00:23:05,225 --> 00:23:07,103
What are you doing for ladies?

270
00:23:07,261 --> 00:23:09,401
I ain't been with a woman
since I got out.

271
00:23:09,562 --> 00:23:11,909
You just lie to me?

272
00:23:12,065 --> 00:23:14,342
Did you not meet my girlfriend,

273
00:23:14,499 --> 00:23:16,778
Pamela Palm?

274
00:23:22,408 --> 00:23:24,253
Tell me the truth.
Tell me the truth.

275
00:23:24,411 --> 00:23:27,018
Got a hooker.
I give her money.

276
00:23:27,179 --> 00:23:30,096
- Is that it?
- Yeah, I got a couple of 'em.

277
00:23:33,753 --> 00:23:34,857
Jesus Christ.

278
00:23:35,020 --> 00:23:37,127
I hope he don't need
medical attention.

279
00:23:46,035 --> 00:23:47,709
You had to call my chief, huh?

280
00:23:47,869 --> 00:23:51,615
Yeah, and I asked for Brian.
Where's Brian?

281
00:23:53,273 --> 00:23:56,279
If Brian gets stuck in your case,
we'll never get him out.

282
00:23:57,479 --> 00:23:59,687
So you get Prince Charming instead.

283
00:24:00,948 --> 00:24:03,899
It's okay.
I feel the same way.

284
00:24:04,053 --> 00:24:06,364
It's 48 hours.
Just make the best of it.

285
00:24:16,230 --> 00:24:19,212
# Little Orphan Annie says,
when the blaze is blue #

286
00:24:19,366 --> 00:24:23,318
#An' the lamp-wick sputters,
an' the wind goes woo #

287
00:24:23,471 --> 00:24:26,921
#An' you hear the winds quit,
an' the moon is gray #

288
00:24:27,075 --> 00:24:30,149
# An' the lightnin' bugs in dew
is all squenched away... #

289
00:24:30,310 --> 00:24:32,053
# You better mind yer parents #

290
00:24:32,212 --> 00:24:34,318
# An' yer teachers fond an' dear #

291
00:24:34,481 --> 00:24:37,327
# An' cherish all that loves you,
an' dry the orphan tears #

292
00:24:37,484 --> 00:24:40,835
# An' he'p the poor an' needy ones
who cluster all about #

293
00:24:40,990 --> 00:24:44,839
# Or the goblins will git you
if you don't watch out. #

294
00:24:52,834 --> 00:24:55,248
- Hey, Reba, how you doin'?
- Hey, Brian, how are you?

295
00:24:55,404 --> 00:24:57,283
- Got something for you.
- Thank you.

296
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:58,852
I need you to take a look
at this for me.

297
00:24:59,008 --> 00:25:01,047
All right.

298
00:25:01,211 --> 00:25:03,089
Oh.

299
00:25:03,245 --> 00:25:06,024
- What are you doing here?
- She's been hanging out here lately.

300
00:25:07,017 --> 00:25:09,362
You know, the girls upstairs
knew her real well.

301
00:25:09,517 --> 00:25:11,521
Come on, let me take y'all up.

302
00:25:12,855 --> 00:25:15,804
Man on the floor!
Man on the floor!

303
00:25:15,957 --> 00:25:17,439
Hey, guys.

304
00:25:17,593 --> 00:25:20,132
I'm Brian-
Texas City Police Department.

305
00:25:20,296 --> 00:25:23,803
This is my partner Mike.
Mind if I sit down?

306
00:25:26,235 --> 00:25:27,612
What's your names?

307
00:25:27,770 --> 00:25:30,411
- Imani.
- I'm Marie.

308
00:25:30,572 --> 00:25:32,713
Marie?

309
00:25:32,874 --> 00:25:35,551
- How long you been in here?
- Four months.

310
00:25:35,710 --> 00:25:37,318
How old are you?

311
00:25:37,482 --> 00:25:39,465
15. She just turned 14.

312
00:25:39,618 --> 00:25:42,225
You have family in here-
a mother, aunt, something?

313
00:25:44,621 --> 00:25:46,398
All right, I have to
show you guys a picture.

314
00:25:46,556 --> 00:25:48,732
I need to know
if you know this girl.

315
00:25:50,260 --> 00:25:52,401
You ever seen her before?

316
00:25:52,563 --> 00:25:54,236
She was our friend.

317
00:25:54,397 --> 00:25:56,641
You know her name?

318
00:25:56,801 --> 00:25:59,181
- Debbie Mills.
- Debbie what?

319
00:25:59,337 --> 00:26:02,344
- Debbie Mills.
- Debbie Mills.

320
00:26:02,507 --> 00:26:05,079
We kept her ID for her.

321
00:26:08,146 --> 00:26:10,627
Mike, you got that other picture?

322
00:26:12,648 --> 00:26:14,598
You ever seen this guy around?

323
00:26:16,187 --> 00:26:19,433
- Yeah.
- Was that her pimp?

324
00:26:21,591 --> 00:26:23,436
Was that her pimp?

325
00:26:24,528 --> 00:26:27,705
- Look, she had to eat.
- You ever seen him smack her?

326
00:26:28,932 --> 00:26:32,178
She would come here to hide
from him and the white guy.

327
00:26:32,335 --> 00:26:34,445
They followed her here
and they dragged her out of bed.

328
00:26:34,607 --> 00:26:36,782
- What else?
- He kicked her. He punched her.

329
00:26:36,943 --> 00:26:39,983
- Yeah?
- He always made her cry.

330
00:26:40,145 --> 00:26:43,220
- What else did he do?
- Tried to take all her money.

331
00:26:43,382 --> 00:26:46,627
That's why we hid her real ID
and her money for her.

332
00:26:46,784 --> 00:26:49,563
You said "white guy."
What'd he look like?

333
00:26:49,722 --> 00:26:52,033
Pointy chin.

334
00:26:52,190 --> 00:26:54,070
Go on, then.

335
00:26:55,127 --> 00:26:57,632
- Short blond hair.
- How short?

336
00:26:57,796 --> 00:27:00,143
I don't know!
Just short blond hair

337
00:27:00,299 --> 00:27:04,147
- Go on.
- Some tattoos. That's all I know.

338
00:27:04,302 --> 00:27:06,079
- Were they on his arms?
- On his arm and his neck.

339
00:27:06,237 --> 00:27:08,584
Okay.

340
00:27:08,740 --> 00:27:11,018
Good.
Give me your IDs.

341
00:27:12,144 --> 00:27:14,251
Thank you.

342
00:27:17,416 --> 00:27:19,419
Don't look at me like that.

343
00:27:21,085 --> 00:27:23,328
07 to base.
We're gonna need CPS down here

344
00:27:23,487 --> 00:27:25,902
at Reba's shelter on North Main.

345
00:27:28,493 --> 00:27:31,536
Texas City Police Department.
Please hold.

346
00:27:31,699 --> 00:27:33,682
Hey, Levon.
Sorry we're late.

347
00:27:33,835 --> 00:27:36,009
- Thank you, thank you.
- Well, okay.

348
00:27:36,170 --> 00:27:38,117
You wanted to ask me
some questions- here I am.

349
00:27:38,271 --> 00:27:40,685
All right, good.
And, yeah.

350
00:27:40,841 --> 00:27:44,381
Interview with Levon Chalmers
by Detectives Heigh and Souder.

351
00:27:44,544 --> 00:27:46,253
I'm glad you want
to cooperate, Levon.

352
00:27:46,412 --> 00:27:49,361
You came in here on your own accord,
so you can leave whenever you want.

353
00:27:49,515 --> 00:27:51,691
That's greatly appreciated.

354
00:27:51,852 --> 00:27:53,764
Here's your rights sheet.
I'm sure you've seen that before.

355
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:56,096
Will you sign that for me, please?

356
00:27:57,757 --> 00:27:59,967
- Thank you.
- This'll be easy.

357
00:28:00,127 --> 00:28:02,302
All I really want to know

358
00:28:02,463 --> 00:28:07,039
is how you get a 14-year-old girl
to become a prostitute.

359
00:28:07,199 --> 00:28:09,377
She said she was 15, man.

360
00:28:09,537 --> 00:28:13,076
So, you knew she was a minor.
Okay. Good.

361
00:28:17,378 --> 00:28:19,587
And you ever beat her up?

362
00:28:22,915 --> 00:28:25,830
Okay, did you ever hold her
against her will?

363
00:28:28,156 --> 00:28:31,106
Did you ever make her suck a dick
in the front seat of a truck

364
00:28:31,260 --> 00:28:34,471
and then you kind of pulled her out
and beat the living shit out of her?

365
00:28:34,629 --> 00:28:36,339
Bri, Pam's on the phone.

366
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:41,750
- I told you only to talk to me.
- You said I could go.

367
00:28:41,903 --> 00:28:45,318
- Wait a minute.
- You sit the fuck down, asshole!

368
00:28:46,441 --> 00:28:48,081
Pimping out young girls.
You motherfucker!

369
00:28:49,412 --> 00:28:50,823
I ought to rip that thing
off your chin

370
00:28:50,978 --> 00:28:53,085
- and shove it up your fuckin' ass!
- Mike!

371
00:28:54,349 --> 00:28:56,922
- Don't you look at me like that.
- Levon came in here for a reason.

372
00:28:57,085 --> 00:28:58,428
You're gonna help us
clear some stuff up, right?

373
00:28:58,585 --> 00:28:59,759
Oh, I'm sorry, Levon.

374
00:28:59,921 --> 00:29:01,493
I'm sorry we're stopping you
from your day job as what--

375
00:29:01,656 --> 00:29:03,102
a fuckin' rocket scientist?

376
00:29:03,258 --> 00:29:04,933
Levon here has got a rep
on the streets.

377
00:29:05,093 --> 00:29:07,097
He knows what's going on.

378
00:29:07,262 --> 00:29:10,006
I'm gonna ask you
a couple questions, all right?

379
00:29:10,165 --> 00:29:13,274
Why would a killer, after he murdered
somebody, cut into 'em?

380
00:29:13,435 --> 00:29:17,614
I'd assume to send a message-
"Don't fuck with us."

381
00:29:18,773 --> 00:29:21,050
- You're assuming to send a message?
- Yeah, I'm assuming.

382
00:29:21,208 --> 00:29:22,780
Yeah, 'cause you're not
that kind of guy.

383
00:29:22,943 --> 00:29:24,150
Nah, that's not me.

384
00:29:24,311 --> 00:29:25,453
All right, what about this other guy
I keep hearing about

385
00:29:25,615 --> 00:29:27,564
that you hang out with,
this white guy with the tattoos?

386
00:29:27,719 --> 00:29:29,290
What's his name?

387
00:29:31,455 --> 00:29:32,900
What's his name?

388
00:29:34,991 --> 00:29:36,494
Rule.

389
00:29:39,129 --> 00:29:42,304
Rule Valley.
His name is Rule Valley.

390
00:29:42,464 --> 00:29:45,746
- Stay close, all right?
- You know where I'm at.

391
00:32:09,282 --> 00:32:12,628
Oh, my God!

392
00:32:12,784 --> 00:32:17,739
No, no!

393
00:32:22,863 --> 00:32:25,472
No, no!

394
00:32:25,633 --> 00:32:28,639
No, no, no!

395
00:32:28,801 --> 00:32:34,415
No!

396
00:32:34,574 --> 00:32:38,720
No! God!

397
00:32:47,321 --> 00:32:50,236
No!

398
00:32:52,559 --> 00:32:56,272
Hey, come here.

399
00:32:56,429 --> 00:32:59,346
911. What is your emergency?

400
00:32:59,501 --> 00:33:01,743
Help me.
A man-- a man in my house.

401
00:33:01,901 --> 00:33:05,078
- Is he still there?
- No. No, he's- he's outside.

402
00:33:05,239 --> 00:33:08,246
Is your address 3214 Collin Avenue?

403
00:33:08,409 --> 00:33:10,391
Yes. And my baby-

404
00:33:10,544 --> 00:33:12,024
Ma'am, put the baby down...

405
00:33:12,178 --> 00:33:14,025
- Brian.
- ...and secure all doors and windows.

406
00:33:14,183 --> 00:33:16,860
- Police are on the way.
- Okay.

407
00:33:21,924 --> 00:33:23,768
Ma'am, do you hear me?

408
00:33:23,925 --> 00:33:25,804
...under attack at this time.
Unknown male assailant.

409
00:33:28,463 --> 00:33:31,036
Oh, no! Ah!

410
00:33:31,199 --> 00:33:33,444
Ma'am? Ma'am, hang on.

411
00:33:33,604 --> 00:33:36,279
- The police are on their way.
- Help me! Help me!

412
00:33:47,648 --> 00:33:52,069
Okay, come on.

413
00:33:54,789 --> 00:33:58,069
I'm making a quick path
through the main room and crossing.

414
00:33:58,226 --> 00:34:01,004
- I may just head off in there.
- 10-4.

415
00:34:13,578 --> 00:34:15,650
What have we got?

416
00:34:15,812 --> 00:34:18,422
He's got to be nearby.
Check this out.

417
00:34:21,485 --> 00:34:24,935
The bag over there
and the street clothes.

418
00:34:25,088 --> 00:34:28,538
Okay, I'll go get K-9 unit.
Leave that bag.

419
00:34:46,275 --> 00:34:50,489
7-IDA-03 in pursuit of suspect,
heading northwest of your location.

420
00:35:12,137 --> 00:35:14,675
- Rawls, Rawls!
- I got him!

421
00:35:20,178 --> 00:35:22,387
- You okay?
- I can't breathe.

422
00:35:22,547 --> 00:35:25,530
We need medical assistance...

423
00:35:36,829 --> 00:35:39,209
I'm telling you,
I was right on that guy's tail.

424
00:35:39,363 --> 00:35:41,742
It was like I got jumped
by two guys.

425
00:35:42,933 --> 00:35:45,178
They find my gun?

426
00:35:45,337 --> 00:35:47,683
No, not yet.
You ready?

427
00:35:49,507 --> 00:35:51,512
You recognize any of this?

428
00:35:53,846 --> 00:35:55,850
Ah. Sorry.

429
00:35:56,014 --> 00:35:57,517
Don't touch.
Just point, okay?

430
00:35:57,682 --> 00:36:01,189
Those are mine.
They were on my clothesline.

431
00:36:02,687 --> 00:36:04,364
That's probably
how he chose you, okay?

432
00:36:04,524 --> 00:36:06,630
He saw your clothes
on that line.

433
00:36:06,794 --> 00:36:08,866
You remember anybody
hanging around your neighborhood,

434
00:36:09,028 --> 00:36:11,135
around your house,
your street, at the mall?

435
00:36:11,297 --> 00:36:12,869
No.

436
00:36:14,701 --> 00:36:16,875
There were two of them.

437
00:36:17,035 --> 00:36:18,948
Say what?

438
00:36:19,105 --> 00:36:21,109
Someone was outside.

439
00:36:28,547 --> 00:36:30,587
Is this your office?

440
00:36:31,652 --> 00:36:33,063
Mm-hmm.

441
00:36:33,218 --> 00:36:35,565
Who can we expect to catch in here?

442
00:36:36,889 --> 00:36:39,338
- Mommy might have to go get Grandma.
- Why?

443
00:36:39,492 --> 00:36:41,907
Well, Grandma and I are gonna
go catch that bad man.

444
00:36:42,062 --> 00:36:43,508
- Why?
- Because the policemen

445
00:36:43,663 --> 00:36:46,110
want to sit in their office
instead of being on the street

446
00:36:46,266 --> 00:36:47,747
looking for the criminal.

447
00:36:47,901 --> 00:36:49,245
Look, I know it's late.

448
00:36:49,402 --> 00:36:51,405
We just need a full description
and a statement.

449
00:36:51,570 --> 00:36:53,745
- That's it.
- See...

450
00:36:53,906 --> 00:36:56,321
- Detective Souder, line 2.
- ...this is probably how he chose you.

451
00:36:56,476 --> 00:36:58,355
Okay? He saw your clothing-

452
00:36:58,511 --> 00:37:01,929
No! No!

453
00:37:02,083 --> 00:37:03,528
- Come with me.
- Brian.

454
00:37:03,684 --> 00:37:05,325
Okay.

455
00:37:05,487 --> 00:37:07,263
Officer, you take them
into my office right now.

456
00:37:07,421 --> 00:37:09,700
And get Jim Roson.
You call him at home if you have to.

457
00:37:09,858 --> 00:37:11,600
Notify County.

458
00:37:16,864 --> 00:37:20,144
No, please stop!

459
00:37:20,301 --> 00:37:24,117
Please stop!

460
00:37:30,277 --> 00:37:32,453
Can you hear that?

461
00:37:50,398 --> 00:37:53,313
I didn't pray for this girl
while it was happening.

462
00:37:56,804 --> 00:37:59,380
I listened to her die,
and it was--

463
00:38:00,643 --> 00:38:03,183
it was like I forgot or something.

464
00:38:16,025 --> 00:38:18,599
You ever wonder why we're here?

465
00:38:18,762 --> 00:38:21,243
Why Texas City?

466
00:38:23,566 --> 00:38:25,913
Well, I know why you're here.

467
00:38:34,342 --> 00:38:36,952
What if I can't stop this one, either?

468
00:39:18,323 --> 00:39:20,497
You ain't gonna like this.

469
00:39:20,657 --> 00:39:24,838
No, please stop! Please stop!

470
00:39:35,839 --> 00:39:38,846
Can you track specifically
where the call originated from?

471
00:39:39,009 --> 00:39:40,353
Yeah, I'm trying, Brian,

472
00:39:40,510 --> 00:39:42,651
but the guy that called you
and your partner last night-

473
00:39:42,813 --> 00:39:43,816
Yeah?

474
00:39:43,982 --> 00:39:46,190
He did it from an area
where we get almost no coverage-

475
00:39:46,350 --> 00:39:49,093
all along those bayous
outside Texas City.

476
00:39:49,252 --> 00:39:51,666
- The killing fields?
- Yeah.

477
00:39:51,822 --> 00:39:54,500
You get a connection,
you walk 10 feet and it disappears,

478
00:39:54,660 --> 00:39:55,663
no matter what we try to do.

479
00:39:55,829 --> 00:39:57,434
We gotta bring in
outside construction contractors

480
00:39:57,596 --> 00:39:59,099
'cause our local people
won't go in there.

481
00:39:59,265 --> 00:40:00,608
Why not?

482
00:40:00,767 --> 00:40:03,305
Even the Indians who got pushed
in there in the 19th century

483
00:40:03,469 --> 00:40:05,450
turned to cannibalism.

484
00:40:05,603 --> 00:40:07,607
It's-- it's-- I don't know.

485
00:40:09,041 --> 00:40:10,851
It's infected or something.

486
00:40:11,844 --> 00:40:15,385
All right, just keep trying, okay?
Just keep trying.

487
00:40:15,546 --> 00:40:18,326
- I'm gonna do everything I can.
- Thanks, Jim.

488
00:40:31,630 --> 00:40:33,668
I thought you went to hell
if you worked on Sunday.

489
00:40:33,831 --> 00:40:37,578
I needed to get a newspaper.
What are you doing here?

490
00:40:37,736 --> 00:40:40,743
When you go to church,
you don't pray for me, right?

491
00:40:40,906 --> 00:40:42,887
No, I pray for you.

492
00:40:43,042 --> 00:40:45,683
- Don't do it no more.
- Why not?

493
00:40:45,843 --> 00:40:48,052
'Cause everyone you pray for
ends up fuckin' dead.

494
00:40:48,213 --> 00:40:51,664
Oh, am I allowed
to say "fuck" in front of him?

495
00:40:51,819 --> 00:40:53,596
Actually, that one's dead.

496
00:40:53,754 --> 00:40:55,757
That's what I'm talking about.

497
00:40:55,923 --> 00:40:58,371
Mike, what's up?

498
00:40:58,526 --> 00:41:01,999
I need subscribers.
That's all the information.

499
00:41:02,163 --> 00:41:04,042
- Today?
- Yes, please.

500
00:41:07,333 --> 00:41:09,681
You brought her in
on a Sunday?

501
00:41:09,838 --> 00:41:12,786
That's Pam's rich kid's
cell phone numbers.

502
00:41:14,107 --> 00:41:16,282
Ls the new pope the one
that don't like fags?

503
00:41:17,877 --> 00:41:20,794
What's going on
with the phone, Mike?

504
00:41:20,948 --> 00:41:22,690
Okay.

505
00:41:22,849 --> 00:41:26,024
'Cause you're from New York,
I will now try to educate you

506
00:41:26,185 --> 00:41:27,759
about round here.

507
00:41:30,191 --> 00:41:32,799
I got an idea- why don't you go home
and aggravate your dog?

508
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:37,070
I don't know if that Laine girl
is alive or dead.

509
00:41:37,230 --> 00:41:40,214
If she is in the fields,

510
00:41:40,366 --> 00:41:42,472
then she is as good as gone.

511
00:41:42,634 --> 00:41:46,555
And it don't matter
her family,

512
00:41:46,709 --> 00:41:51,458
money, newspaper people,
detectives,

513
00:41:51,613 --> 00:41:53,595
or how much you want to pray...

514
00:41:55,384 --> 00:41:58,765
half of her is probably
back in the food chain.

515
00:42:01,722 --> 00:42:03,567
You have her picture?

516
00:42:35,657 --> 00:42:37,434
This is Us-.

517
00:42:37,592 --> 00:42:41,270
Texas City, Debbie Mills.

518
00:42:41,429 --> 00:42:43,379
One dead girl,

519
00:42:43,534 --> 00:42:46,016
one unsolved.

520
00:42:47,337 --> 00:42:49,375
This is them-

521
00:42:49,539 --> 00:42:52,523
Clark County, the fields.

522
00:42:52,676 --> 00:42:54,554
It's not our jurisdiction.

523
00:43:49,001 --> 00:43:51,278
- What?
- Hey, that's enough now.

524
00:43:51,436 --> 00:43:54,784
I told you to stay out
when I got the company, baby.

525
00:43:55,839 --> 00:43:58,618
Now, come on.
Come on.

526
00:44:01,512 --> 00:44:06,364
You just get your stuff
and get out of here.

527
00:44:06,518 --> 00:44:07,690
Now.

528
00:44:09,754 --> 00:44:12,362
- Fuck you, Russell!
- Hey, what's going on?

529
00:44:12,523 --> 00:44:14,402
I don't know.
One of Mama's boyfriends.

530
00:44:14,559 --> 00:44:16,904
Oh, shit.

531
00:44:17,060 --> 00:44:20,307
Where you going, ladybug?

532
00:44:21,532 --> 00:44:24,880
# Ladybug, ladybug,
fly away home #

533
00:44:25,037 --> 00:44:27,882
# The house is on fire
and the kids are all gone. #

534
00:44:28,038 --> 00:44:29,917
Ladybug

535
00:44:51,931 --> 00:44:54,276
- $5.50.
- All right.

536
00:44:59,005 --> 00:45:00,917
Wait.

537
00:45:10,516 --> 00:45:12,520
$7.25.

538
00:45:16,856 --> 00:45:18,530
Thank you.

539
00:45:20,427 --> 00:45:22,465
A pack of Reds in the box.

540
00:45:39,947 --> 00:45:42,691
Dad!

541
00:45:42,850 --> 00:45:44,388
Hey, guys.

542
00:45:44,552 --> 00:45:47,660
Sean, this is Anne.

543
00:45:47,821 --> 00:45:50,704
Anne, this is my kids.
This is Coryn.

544
00:45:51,959 --> 00:45:54,305
That's Grandma over there.

545
00:45:54,463 --> 00:45:56,967
- Where's your mom, guys?
- Inside.

546
00:45:57,131 --> 00:45:59,636
Mom, Dad's home!

547
00:45:59,800 --> 00:46:01,679
- Who's this?
- This is Anne.

548
00:46:01,836 --> 00:46:04,148
Anne, this is my wife Gwen.

549
00:46:05,405 --> 00:46:06,818
This is for you.

550
00:46:06,973 --> 00:46:09,684
Well, thank you very much.

551
00:46:09,844 --> 00:46:12,657
Come on.
Everybody come on in.

552
00:46:13,981 --> 00:46:15,757
Pass the plates, Mom.

553
00:46:15,916 --> 00:46:17,489
One more meatloaf coming up.

554
00:46:17,652 --> 00:46:20,065
This is our Sunday tradition.

555
00:46:20,221 --> 00:46:21,394
You got it, Mama?

556
00:46:21,555 --> 00:46:24,538
For over 100 years,
ever since the war.

557
00:46:26,359 --> 00:46:29,775
Not today, not today, not today.

558
00:46:29,929 --> 00:46:32,277
- Here's some mashed potatoes.
- You take some of that.

559
00:46:32,435 --> 00:46:35,885
That's right, hooves,
or it can chews the 'could.'

560
00:46:36,038 --> 00:46:39,510
My question is, "What is the could?"
Everybody get this.

561
00:46:39,674 --> 00:46:42,021
- What is the could?
- The could.

562
00:46:42,178 --> 00:46:46,028
Hold on, I'll get the phone.

563
00:46:51,019 --> 00:46:52,296
Hello?

564
00:46:52,456 --> 00:46:54,903
Honey, it's Pam.

565
00:47:00,530 --> 00:47:03,878
- It's okay. I'll take her home.
- Mommy.

566
00:47:14,477 --> 00:47:16,047
You good?

567
00:47:16,212 --> 00:47:18,057
I'll be right back, okay?

568
00:47:18,214 --> 00:47:20,218
You doin' all right, son?

569
00:47:31,663 --> 00:47:34,235
The boy found the body
when he was walking his dog.

570
00:47:34,398 --> 00:47:37,281
I left a message for Mike
on his cell phone.

571
00:47:37,435 --> 00:47:40,178
Yep, left about 15 messages.

572
00:47:40,337 --> 00:47:42,284
- Haven't heard from him?
- I learned on our honeymoon,

573
00:47:42,438 --> 00:47:45,286
never call Mike after 2:00
in the afternoon on a weekend.

574
00:47:53,784 --> 00:47:55,788
This ain't good, Bri.

575
00:47:59,288 --> 00:48:01,795
- Is it Kirsten Laine?
- Yeah, it is.

576
00:48:04,660 --> 00:48:06,665
They took her hands.

577
00:48:15,339 --> 00:48:17,844
Her dress is buttoned up wrong.

578
00:48:18,008 --> 00:48:20,547
Somebody put that dress
back on her.

579
00:48:20,710 --> 00:48:23,660
You see the cause of death?

580
00:48:23,814 --> 00:48:25,351
Not yet.

581
00:48:25,515 --> 00:48:27,521
We got to get her out of here.

582
00:48:32,224 --> 00:48:34,172
I got something here.

583
00:48:39,631 --> 00:48:41,169
Pam, I got a print.

584
00:48:44,002 --> 00:48:45,311
Damn it.

585
00:48:45,470 --> 00:48:47,009
Ugh!

586
00:48:50,009 --> 00:48:53,516
Come on.

587
00:48:54,746 --> 00:48:57,389
Pull her out.

588
00:48:57,550 --> 00:49:00,691
God damn it!

589
00:49:00,852 --> 00:49:03,563
Good. You got it?
You still got it?

590
00:49:05,024 --> 00:49:07,562
Oh, God!

591
00:49:09,161 --> 00:49:11,733
- No. Damn it! Damn it.
- God!

592
00:49:19,369 --> 00:49:21,545
Here, here.

593
00:49:25,713 --> 00:49:27,591
God damn.

594
00:49:33,520 --> 00:49:35,398
Here.

595
00:49:39,392 --> 00:49:41,532
Why don't you answer your phone
once in a while, Detective?

596
00:49:41,695 --> 00:49:44,041
You got 30 cops,
you got feds,

597
00:49:44,197 --> 00:49:47,079
a fuckin' helicopter, you got
my fuckin' partner part time!

598
00:49:47,233 --> 00:49:49,237
What the hell else you want?

599
00:49:56,610 --> 00:49:58,784
I pulled Levon's rap sheet.
You get a chance to read it?

600
00:49:58,944 --> 00:50:00,448
Huh?

601
00:50:01,916 --> 00:50:04,261
You got rape, kidnapping, assault.

602
00:50:05,820 --> 00:50:08,597
You got two guys with priors.

603
00:50:10,255 --> 00:50:11,964
It goes right to them.

604
00:50:16,930 --> 00:50:19,104
Our beat is Texas City.

605
00:50:19,264 --> 00:50:23,515
I don't want to be here.
You don't belong here.

606
00:50:27,908 --> 00:50:30,323
What if this is the girl we heard?

607
00:50:32,280 --> 00:50:36,129
She was down and bound

608
00:50:36,283 --> 00:50:38,321
here in this place.

609
00:50:38,485 --> 00:50:40,765
And somebody took the time
to pick up their cell phone

610
00:50:40,922 --> 00:50:42,960
and dial a number.

611
00:50:43,124 --> 00:50:46,438
You know whose fucking number
they dialed, Mike?

612
00:50:46,594 --> 00:50:49,008
That was yours and mine.

613
00:52:59,730 --> 00:53:02,178
We're in there the other night
and there's no women there

614
00:53:02,333 --> 00:53:05,076
and it's just dudes,
and they're all from North Carolina.

615
00:53:05,235 --> 00:53:06,943
How'd you know they all
from North Carolina?

616
00:53:07,103 --> 00:53:09,951
Well, they know Sparta,
Winston-Salem, Boone.

617
00:53:10,108 --> 00:53:13,423
So anyway, there's no women there.
So I said, "Let's play cricket."

618
00:53:13,579 --> 00:53:16,119
Cricket?
Ain't no cricket in North Carolina.

619
00:53:16,282 --> 00:53:18,764
Oh, yes, they is.

620
00:53:18,918 --> 00:53:20,866
Cricket's a game they play
in England.

621
00:53:21,020 --> 00:53:24,936
You gotta be rich or a fag to play it.

622
00:53:25,090 --> 00:53:27,368
I'm talkin' crickets and darts, man.
Come on.

623
00:53:28,360 --> 00:53:30,535
Then you should have said "darts."

624
00:53:35,302 --> 00:53:37,978
You know what I mean, though--
you gotta cancel out the 20s;

625
00:53:38,137 --> 00:53:41,052
you cancel out the 19s;
you cancel out the 18s.

626
00:53:41,206 --> 00:53:44,019
So, anyway, we're waiting
on them whores, and Brett-

627
00:53:44,177 --> 00:53:46,215
Don't say "whores"
in front of your little sister.

628
00:53:47,812 --> 00:53:50,558
They don't come inside
till around 11:00,

629
00:53:50,716 --> 00:53:52,698
after the last shift.

630
00:53:57,723 --> 00:54:01,573
You know, it's none of your business
what I say in front of my little sister.

631
00:54:01,727 --> 00:54:02,728
Hey. Hey!

632
00:54:04,028 --> 00:54:05,168
Hey!

633
00:54:08,735 --> 00:54:11,743
How about I choke
your fuckin' lights out? Huh?

634
00:54:15,009 --> 00:54:17,719
You dumb little bastard.

635
00:54:22,917 --> 00:54:24,488
Should I get out and get her?

636
00:54:24,651 --> 00:54:29,002
Nah. She's just gonna run on you.

637
00:54:51,279 --> 00:54:53,851
# Twinkle, twinkle, little star,
how I wonder where you are #

638
00:54:54,015 --> 00:54:57,556
# Up above the world so high,
like a diamond in the sky #

639
00:54:57,717 --> 00:54:59,891
# Twinkle, twinkle, little star... #

640
00:55:08,231 --> 00:55:09,642
What does he want?

641
00:55:10,866 --> 00:55:12,973
You're not back working the streets,
are you, Lady Worm?

642
00:55:13,135 --> 00:55:15,414
I gave that up a long time ago,
Officer Cracker.

643
00:55:17,204 --> 00:55:19,483
- So you're an upstanding citizen?
- Mm-hmm, that's right.

644
00:55:19,641 --> 00:55:21,987
All right.
Then, uh...

645
00:55:22,144 --> 00:55:24,558
you wouldn't mind
telling me about the white guy

646
00:55:24,713 --> 00:55:26,217
with the green Pontiac.

647
00:55:26,381 --> 00:55:29,888
- You got a warrant?
- Just open the damn door.

648
00:55:35,123 --> 00:55:37,936
It's none of your
damn business what's in here

649
00:55:44,967 --> 00:55:46,949
No plates on this.

650
00:55:47,937 --> 00:55:49,747
White guy took them off,
then parked it here.

651
00:55:49,906 --> 00:55:51,283
Uh-huh.

652
00:55:51,439 --> 00:55:54,480
- And how long has it been here?
- Two days.

653
00:55:54,642 --> 00:55:56,590
. Is he paving yo"?
- No.

654
00:55:56,745 --> 00:55:59,991
- No?
- You stupid? I said no.

655
00:56:00,148 --> 00:56:02,632
I ain't crazy.
I ain't asking him for no money.

656
00:56:02,785 --> 00:56:04,494
'Cause I don't want to have to
run you in as an accessory.

657
00:56:04,655 --> 00:56:06,136
Detective, you wouldn't
be talking to me that way

658
00:56:06,290 --> 00:56:07,463
if we was in a white neighborhood.

659
00:56:07,624 --> 00:56:08,797
Why do you say that?

660
00:56:08,959 --> 00:56:11,441
It means I don't see you
living on my street after work.

661
00:56:11,595 --> 00:56:14,477
And you damn sure ain't gonna
let me sleep where you live.

662
00:56:16,165 --> 00:56:18,512
Go sit on the curb
and don't go nowhere.

663
00:56:57,007 --> 00:57:00,926
- This all for the Laine girl?
- Yeah.

664
00:57:05,382 --> 00:57:07,022
Where are we headed?

665
00:57:07,185 --> 00:57:09,828
Poachers' bar, near the fields.

666
00:57:16,194 --> 00:57:18,540
Don't touch that.
Let me get it.

667
00:57:49,026 --> 00:57:51,942
Might be.
Need to thaw it out.

668
00:57:52,096 --> 00:57:54,442
Missing a ring finger?

669
00:57:55,566 --> 00:57:57,311
All right, here.

670
00:58:02,641 --> 00:58:05,557
I'm gonna need gas and restaurant
receipts for the last four days.

671
00:58:05,712 --> 00:58:08,457
Did I say something funny?

672
00:58:08,615 --> 00:58:10,151
Come on, darling.

673
00:58:10,316 --> 00:58:13,789
Why don't you introduce us
to the boys who found the hand?

674
00:58:42,249 --> 00:58:44,025
I tried.

675
00:58:57,198 --> 00:59:01,308
I'm Detective Heigh,
Texas City Police Department.

676
00:59:01,469 --> 00:59:03,816
Which one of you found the hand?

677
00:59:03,971 --> 00:59:05,610
Me.

678
00:59:06,806 --> 00:59:08,447
What about you?

679
00:59:08,609 --> 00:59:10,317
I wasn't there.

680
00:59:10,478 --> 00:59:12,482
What's your name?

681
00:59:13,682 --> 00:59:15,162
Frank.

682
00:59:17,152 --> 00:59:19,498
All right, Frank.

683
00:59:20,956 --> 00:59:23,665
I'm gonna need that ring back.

684
00:59:23,823 --> 00:59:25,827
What ring?

685
00:59:27,828 --> 00:59:30,207
I'm gonna need that ring back.

686
00:59:32,234 --> 00:59:34,511
So, is this the gratitude we get

687
00:59:34,669 --> 00:59:37,175
for giving you guys a hand?

688
00:59:43,579 --> 00:59:46,186
Hey!

689
00:59:48,648 --> 00:59:51,725
Stop it! Down!
Get the fuck down!

690
00:59:53,657 --> 00:59:55,604
Get down!

691
00:59:57,260 --> 01:00:00,038
Get the fuck down!

692
01:00:04,399 --> 01:00:06,848
Bri, we're good.

693
01:00:07,002 --> 01:00:09,176
Bri!

694
01:00:09,338 --> 01:00:10,752
Enough!

695
01:00:10,908 --> 01:00:12,445
Bri, stop.

696
01:00:14,344 --> 01:00:16,053
Brian, enough!

697
01:00:16,212 --> 01:00:18,215
Brian!

698
01:00:18,380 --> 01:00:20,384
Enough!

699
01:00:23,185 --> 01:00:25,565
Brian!

700
01:00:29,226 --> 01:00:31,264
Where'd you find it?

701
01:00:34,596 --> 01:00:35,974
I'm gonna get a map,
and you're gonna show me

702
01:00:36,132 --> 01:00:38,135
goddamn exactly where it is.

703
01:00:53,417 --> 01:00:56,800
- I ain't seen you in years, boy.
- Mm-hmm.

704
01:00:58,222 --> 01:01:00,829
You're an important person now, huh?

705
01:01:00,990 --> 01:01:03,497
You used to come over here
a lot with your daddy.

706
01:01:03,662 --> 01:01:06,577
Oh, yeah, I remember
when he made me hang around

707
01:01:06,730 --> 01:01:11,445
while-- while you and the rest
of the bums- remember?

708
01:01:11,603 --> 01:01:15,110
You just drank
as much alcohol as y'all could

709
01:01:15,272 --> 01:01:16,980
and then--

710
01:01:17,141 --> 01:01:18,622
and then y'all would vomit
all over each other.

711
01:01:18,776 --> 01:01:21,452
- Shit, you remember that night?
- Yeah.

712
01:01:21,612 --> 01:01:24,926
First guy pukes, and then all the rest
go at the same time,

713
01:01:25,082 --> 01:01:27,462
- all over that damn card game.
- Mm-hmm.

714
01:01:27,618 --> 01:01:29,463
You got to drive 'em home, though.

715
01:01:29,620 --> 01:01:32,001
You was, what?
11 or 12?

716
01:01:32,157 --> 01:01:33,795
11.

717
01:01:35,658 --> 01:01:38,268
Yeah, I was 11.

718
01:01:38,429 --> 01:01:41,845
Next time you don't answer
my partner's questions,

719
01:01:41,999 --> 01:01:45,281
I'm gonna take
your peace officer's license

720
01:01:45,438 --> 01:01:47,819
and I'm gonna shove it
up your ass.

721
01:01:51,810 --> 01:01:54,156
You say hi to Nancy for me.

722
01:01:59,485 --> 01:02:02,468
- Will these do?
- Yeah.

723
01:02:08,227 --> 01:02:11,699
So, Levon and Rule

724
01:02:11,863 --> 01:02:14,676
stashed the car
in Lady Worm's garage.

725
01:02:15,667 --> 01:02:20,347
There's blood spatters.
There's a potential murder weapon.

726
01:02:20,504 --> 01:02:22,545
It's the works.

727
01:02:22,708 --> 01:02:24,916
The DNA's a match for Debbie Mills.

728
01:02:25,076 --> 01:02:28,026
The judge issued warrants.
We'll pick 'em up on site.

729
01:02:29,581 --> 01:02:31,085
Yeah.

730
01:02:36,420 --> 01:02:38,230
You know--

731
01:02:38,389 --> 01:02:40,235
you know,
I wish I'd seen all this.

732
01:02:40,393 --> 01:02:42,000
What were you thinking?

733
01:02:42,162 --> 01:02:45,078
Huh? Were you thinking,
"I'm a big New York gorilla"?

734
01:02:45,233 --> 01:02:46,713
- Thinking, "I'm a big tough guy..."
- Go away, Mike.

735
01:02:46,867 --> 01:02:47,903
"...Getting all tough
on those small-town fish"?

736
01:02:48,069 --> 01:02:49,948
Was I talking to you?

737
01:02:56,410 --> 01:02:59,758
Go on.

738
01:03:03,784 --> 01:03:06,392
You don't know how close
to the edge you are.

739
01:03:08,855 --> 01:03:11,736
You belong with Levon and Rule

740
01:03:11,891 --> 01:03:14,705
in Texas City with me.

741
01:03:14,862 --> 01:03:18,072
You don't know
where you are right here.

742
01:03:19,966 --> 01:03:24,477
This place- this place
is nothing but chaos.

743
01:03:25,705 --> 01:03:28,210
Your God don't even come here.

744
01:03:30,076 --> 01:03:32,820
You don't know
where you are right here.

745
01:03:38,117 --> 01:03:40,432
I know exactly where I am.

746
01:04:07,782 --> 01:04:09,194
See the red?

747
01:04:09,350 --> 01:04:12,129
That's the first call to 911
from that woman Lila.

748
01:04:12,286 --> 01:04:13,664
The assailant's
the background voice

749
01:04:13,821 --> 01:04:16,465
Now, the blue--

750
01:04:16,625 --> 01:04:19,129
that's the call that came in later
on your office phone.

751
01:04:19,294 --> 01:04:21,674
See? They match.

752
01:04:21,830 --> 01:04:24,141
All right, where'd the second call
come from?

753
01:04:27,269 --> 01:04:28,874
- The fields.
- Yeah.

754
01:04:29,037 --> 01:04:32,349
<i>And he's using a cell-
someone else's.

755
01:04:32,506 --> 01:04:35,790
A-- someone called...

756
01:04:37,147 --> 01:04:38,822
Kirsten Laine.

757
01:04:43,052 --> 01:04:45,660
He's using her cell.

758
01:04:45,822 --> 01:04:48,998
He wants us to know
he can use her cell.

759
01:04:49,157 --> 01:04:51,903
All right, how much coverage
can you get on this number?

760
01:04:54,230 --> 01:04:55,369
I need your help.

761
01:04:55,533 --> 01:04:58,845
I need you to get me up
on that girl's cell phone, okay?

762
01:05:13,584 --> 01:05:17,160
She got caught trying to sell
a driver's license at school.

763
01:05:17,320 --> 01:05:18,858
Had your card on her.

764
01:05:23,058 --> 01:05:26,874
Can't you just go home and watch TV
like other kids? Can you do that?

765
01:05:27,030 --> 01:05:29,707
- Yeah.
- Then get out of here. Go do it.

766
01:05:39,009 --> 01:05:42,721
Look, what did I do? Huh?

767
01:05:42,880 --> 01:05:45,386
What did I do?

768
01:05:58,229 --> 01:06:00,768
You know you're never alone?

769
01:06:00,932 --> 01:06:03,709
There's always someone
looking out for you.

770
01:06:03,867 --> 01:06:07,408
Now, who's that, hmm? God?

771
01:06:09,439 --> 01:06:12,288
Now, you see,
God's too busy for me.

772
01:06:12,444 --> 01:06:13,890
I figured it out.

773
01:06:14,045 --> 01:06:16,391
Everybody's always, you know,
busting his balls all the time-

774
01:06:16,547 --> 01:06:19,292
you know, "Give me this.
I want that."

775
01:06:19,451 --> 01:06:21,660
He ain't got time for little people.

776
01:06:22,954 --> 01:06:24,331
Not me.

777
01:06:25,722 --> 01:06:27,432
Is that what you think?

778
01:06:35,134 --> 01:06:37,912
You all right?

779
01:06:38,070 --> 01:06:40,519
Yeah.

780
01:06:46,278 --> 01:06:48,624
Why don't you run in

781
01:06:48,781 --> 01:06:51,697
and get some of that
milk of magnesia stuff?

782
01:06:51,851 --> 01:06:53,924
Here, let me give you some money.

783
01:06:55,021 --> 01:06:57,197
I'm gonna stay here
and make a phone call, okay?

784
01:06:57,357 --> 01:06:59,360
- Yeah.
- I'll be waiting for you.

785
01:07:09,869 --> 01:07:13,013
Jim, it's Brian.

786
01:07:13,173 --> 01:07:15,814
Jim, no, I just want to know
when the line is up.

787
01:07:17,642 --> 01:07:19,385
All right. Will you let me know
as soon as you are?

788
01:07:40,033 --> 01:07:41,708
Pam, it's Brian.

789
01:07:45,672 --> 01:07:48,383
You get any prints
off what we found?

790
01:07:50,043 --> 01:07:53,050
All right. All right, bye.

791
01:08:09,029 --> 01:08:11,068
Excuse me.
A little girl just came in here.

792
01:08:11,231 --> 01:08:12,507
- Did you see her?
- I don't know.

793
01:08:12,667 --> 01:08:14,875
- I heard some kids fighting.
- Anne?

794
01:08:15,035 --> 01:08:17,450
Might be in the bathroom
in the back.

795
01:08:17,604 --> 01:08:18,844
Anne?

796
01:08:19,005 --> 01:08:22,217
- Your security cameras up?
- Haven't worked in weeks.

797
01:08:25,614 --> 01:08:27,357
Anne?

798
01:08:36,391 --> 01:08:37,929
Anne!

799
01:08:46,201 --> 01:08:48,945
06 to base, I got a possible abduction
at a Jim's Convenience Store.

800
01:08:49,104 --> 01:08:51,108
Will you send some cars?

801
01:09:57,808 --> 01:10:01,451
Base to 7-IDA-07.

802
01:10:01,612 --> 01:10:02,613
Go ahead, base.

803
01:10:02,779 --> 01:10:05,125
We can't raise 06.

804
01:10:05,281 --> 01:10:07,389
Just try Brian at his residence.

805
01:10:07,551 --> 01:10:09,829
Tell him we're set up at the garage.

806
01:10:21,167 --> 01:10:23,580
7-IDA-03 to 7-IDA-07.

807
01:10:23,735 --> 01:10:25,842
03, go ahead.

808
01:10:26,004 --> 01:10:27,417
Yeah, we got a green Pontiac
doing the block here.

809
01:10:27,572 --> 01:10:29,177
He's been by us three times already.

810
01:10:29,341 --> 01:10:31,982
- All right, give me the plate.
- It's not our guy, 07.

811
01:10:32,143 --> 01:10:36,926
It is Texas 89 Juliet Romeo 623.

812
01:10:37,082 --> 01:10:39,030
They've left the area.

813
01:10:39,184 --> 01:10:42,100
Is that thing decked out
with custom wheels and dent in the rear?

814
01:10:42,255 --> 01:10:43,668
10-4

815
01:10:43,823 --> 01:10:45,268
Well, they just changed the plates.

816
01:10:45,424 --> 01:10:49,032
All units, our boys are gonna be
back in the hood.

817
01:10:58,003 --> 01:11:00,954
7-IDA-07, 10-4.
They're back on the set.

818
01:11:04,709 --> 01:11:07,419
07 to all units,
just stand by for my signal.

819
01:12:03,002 --> 01:12:04,574
Leave a message.

820
01:12:04,737 --> 01:12:06,684
Mike?

821
01:12:07,973 --> 01:12:11,117
I think they snatched Little Anne.
I need you and your dog out here.

822
01:12:11,278 --> 01:12:12,658
I'm midway between
the Taylor crime scene

823
01:12:12,814 --> 01:12:14,294
and the poachers' camp.

824
01:12:14,449 --> 01:12:15,862
Damn it.

825
01:12:32,368 --> 01:12:34,975
Base, I need you
to raise my partner.

826
01:12:35,136 --> 01:12:37,643
Base to 7-IDA-06.

827
01:12:39,541 --> 01:12:41,613
Base to 7-IDA-06.

828
01:12:42,976 --> 01:12:46,484
Base to 7-IDA-07;
06 not responding.

829
01:12:53,721 --> 01:12:57,228
I want them to enter
the garage before we take them.

830
01:13:02,196 --> 01:13:06,010
- Is that one of our two ladies?
- Yeah. It's the old one, I think.

831
01:13:06,167 --> 01:13:08,580
She's heading east,
coming your way.

832
01:13:08,735 --> 01:13:10,686
07 to 03, what's her 20?

833
01:13:10,840 --> 01:13:13,345
03 to 07,
passing by your location

834
01:13:13,510 --> 01:13:16,083
with a shopping bag right now.

835
01:13:58,787 --> 01:14:00,790
Ahh!

836
01:14:03,226 --> 01:14:05,138
- Ow, ow!
- Stay down.

837
01:14:05,295 --> 01:14:06,709
It's okay.
Help's coming.

838
01:14:06,864 --> 01:14:09,143
My legs! Look at my legs!
- Stay calm. Look at me.

839
01:14:09,301 --> 01:14:11,578
Stay calm.

840
01:14:11,735 --> 01:14:14,811
Sheila!
There-- that driver, that car!

841
01:14:14,973 --> 01:14:17,887
07 to all units,
suspect's vehicle has hostage.

842
01:14:18,041 --> 01:14:20,215
I got a civilian with burns.

843
01:14:25,583 --> 01:14:27,155
Come on, get here!

844
01:14:27,318 --> 01:14:29,561
- Stay here. It's okay, I'm here.
- Help me. Help me.

845
01:14:29,720 --> 01:14:31,669
Deal with her!

846
01:14:44,435 --> 01:14:48,284
- Let me the fuck out!
Shut the fuck up, bitch. Shut up!

847
01:14:49,808 --> 01:14:52,483
07 in pursuit,
green Pontiac

848
01:15:16,434 --> 01:15:17,972
Get off my ass!

849
01:15:38,223 --> 01:15:40,172
Shit!

850
01:15:40,326 --> 01:15:42,308
- What the fuck is this shit?
- I got this shit.

851
01:15:42,461 --> 01:15:46,002
What the fuck? We got shit.
Get back in the fuckin' car, man.

852
01:15:46,165 --> 01:15:48,305
What the fuck are you doing?

853
01:15:53,205 --> 01:15:55,483
This is motherfuckin' bad.

854
01:16:02,549 --> 01:16:05,362
Fuck.

855
01:16:06,687 --> 01:16:08,190
Motherfucker.

856
01:16:43,625 --> 01:16:46,470
Mike, listen, I think
they snatched Little Anne.

857
01:16:46,626 --> 01:16:47,901
I need you and your dog out here.

858
01:16:48,060 --> 01:16:49,541
I'm midway between
the Taylor crime scene

859
01:16:49,696 --> 01:16:51,200
and the poachers' camp.

860
01:16:57,406 --> 01:16:59,410
Hey!

861
01:17:04,446 --> 01:17:07,727
I had her at a convenience store.

862
01:17:07,884 --> 01:17:10,388
She didn't come back out.

863
01:17:10,551 --> 01:17:12,760
I went in-
signs of a struggle

864
01:17:13,788 --> 01:17:16,829
Phone company
says this is where

865
01:17:16,992 --> 01:17:18,940
the phone call to us
originated from.

866
01:17:20,963 --> 01:17:23,605
So, I come from the biggest
clusterfuck of my career

867
01:17:23,766 --> 01:17:26,271
to come look at a map and mud.

868
01:17:28,904 --> 01:17:30,851
The body was found
right over there.

869
01:17:32,940 --> 01:17:35,116
This is where Pam
found the latest girl.

870
01:17:35,278 --> 01:17:38,659
These are other body recovery sites.

871
01:17:40,282 --> 01:17:42,787
This bayou
we're standing in right now

872
01:17:42,951 --> 01:17:44,954
connects every single one
of those sites.

873
01:17:47,856 --> 01:17:49,803
It's right here.

874
01:18:08,846 --> 01:18:10,154
I'm in this shit, too.

875
01:18:10,313 --> 01:18:12,488
Yeah, you be Big Billy Badass.
That don't make you hard.

876
01:18:12,649 --> 01:18:13,890
You still be a bitch in my book.

877
01:18:14,050 --> 01:18:15,895
That's not what I'm trying
to say, nigga.

878
01:18:16,052 --> 01:18:17,464
Then what you saying?

879
01:18:17,620 --> 01:18:20,797
You don't shoot no laws.
You gotta discriminate.

880
01:18:20,958 --> 01:18:23,337
I do whatever the fuck I want.

881
01:18:24,827 --> 01:18:28,005
I even do you like that,
you get in my way.

882
01:18:28,164 --> 01:18:30,167
You'd pull a gun on me?

883
01:18:30,332 --> 01:18:32,542
That's it- our friendship
just died right then.

884
01:18:35,506 --> 01:18:37,419
Get your toy, nigger.

885
01:19:01,365 --> 01:19:03,905
See, you hard, you pull that trigger.

886
01:20:17,776 --> 01:20:19,690
Brian.

887
01:20:21,013 --> 01:20:23,153
Brian, over here.

888
01:20:31,625 --> 01:20:33,628
She's alive, she's alive.
I've got a pulse.

889
01:20:33,793 --> 01:20:37,005
It's okay, it's okay.
We'll get you out of here.

890
01:20:39,165 --> 01:20:42,045
- God damn it.
- Hang in there, hang in there.

891
01:20:43,369 --> 01:20:45,546
- Go, go.
- All right.

892
01:20:49,944 --> 01:20:51,891
Come on!

893
01:21:13,368 --> 01:21:15,144
- There we go.
- Get her out of here.

894
01:21:15,303 --> 01:21:18,013
Brian, don't do nothing stupid.

895
01:21:21,875 --> 01:21:24,085
- Now, we got two fugitives.
- They kept her alive,

896
01:21:24,245 --> 01:21:25,657
- 'cause they're coming back for her.
- No!

897
01:21:25,813 --> 01:21:28,160
Get out of my way!
Damn it.

898
01:21:28,316 --> 01:21:30,524
- What do I tell Gwen?
- She already knows.

899
01:21:30,685 --> 01:21:32,927
Come on, Lee.

900
01:22:27,277 --> 01:22:29,451
Alex!

901
01:22:29,612 --> 01:22:31,389
Stay here with the ambulance.
I'm going up ahead.

902
01:22:31,547 --> 01:22:33,756
- I want an update in 15.
- Yes, ma'am.

903
01:22:46,997 --> 01:22:48,569
Where? Where am I going?

904
01:22:48,733 --> 01:22:50,737
He's here.
Follow this bayou.

905
01:22:50,901 --> 01:22:52,347
- All right.
- Okay?

906
01:22:52,503 --> 01:22:55,281
That fucking idiot took our dog.

907
01:22:58,909 --> 01:23:00,413
My dog.

908
01:23:01,513 --> 01:23:03,494
My dog.

909
01:23:43,055 --> 01:23:45,629
Put your hands above your head.

910
01:23:50,528 --> 01:23:52,739
Get down on your knees.

911
01:23:54,331 --> 01:23:56,838
I said get down
on your goddamn knees.

912
01:24:04,076 --> 01:24:06,058
Ah! Ah!

913
01:24:18,190 --> 01:24:20,695
Go! Go!

914
01:24:20,859 --> 01:24:22,771
Go!

915
01:24:31,936 --> 01:24:34,717
- Yeah?
- He's dead.

916
01:24:39,346 --> 01:24:41,224
Who's dead? Who is this?

917
01:24:47,553 --> 01:24:50,230
- He said he's dead.
- He said Brian's dead?

918
01:24:50,389 --> 01:24:51,960
I think so.

919
01:24:52,125 --> 01:24:54,939
You think so?

920
01:24:55,095 --> 01:24:57,543
Task force 3 to all units,
prepare to copy.

921
01:24:57,698 --> 01:25:00,271
Just received unknown caller,
said 06 dead.

922
01:25:00,433 --> 01:25:01,812
Repeat, said 06 dead.

923
01:25:01,969 --> 01:25:04,075
- No further information.
- It's Brian's phone.

924
01:25:08,307 --> 01:25:10,220
Yeah, hello?

925
01:25:10,376 --> 01:25:13,918
Brian, he just called your partner
He said somebody's dead.

926
01:25:14,081 --> 01:25:15,254
Who is this?

927
01:25:17,384 --> 01:25:18,763
Who am I talking to?

928
01:25:18,919 --> 01:25:21,127
I'm Brian's partner.
Who the fuck are you?

929
01:25:21,287 --> 01:25:23,064
How did you know I got a call?

930
01:25:23,222 --> 01:25:24,600
If you don't give me
the right answer,

931
01:25:24,757 --> 01:25:26,999
I'm gonna come fuckin' over there
and find you.

932
01:25:27,159 --> 01:25:29,472
The guy's using
Kirsten Laine's cell phone.

933
01:25:30,633 --> 01:25:32,807
You're up on the girl's cell phone?

934
01:25:32,967 --> 01:25:34,744
Yes.

935
01:25:34,903 --> 01:25:37,249
Where'd the call originate from?

936
01:25:37,406 --> 01:25:39,581
It came from the tower
on the west side,

937
01:25:39,742 --> 01:25:41,586
near the old bridge.

938
01:25:43,111 --> 01:25:44,613
Okay.

939
01:25:46,147 --> 01:25:49,494
Okay, you call me
if he uses it again. You hear?

940
01:25:54,289 --> 01:25:57,136
He said the killer's using
the victim's cell phone.

941
01:25:58,527 --> 01:26:00,872
Near that bridge.

942
01:26:01,028 --> 01:26:03,136
Lucie's place.

943
01:26:03,298 --> 01:26:05,438
Fuckin' knew it!

944
01:26:05,599 --> 01:26:07,705
I knew it.

945
01:26:32,530 --> 01:26:34,670
Take 'em.

946
01:26:39,336 --> 01:26:41,180
Go.

947
01:26:56,486 --> 01:26:58,558
- Check this out, right here.
- Wait. Shh.

948
01:27:01,390 --> 01:27:03,871
This way!

949
01:28:21,604 --> 01:28:23,452
Give me the girl's phone number.

950
01:28:23,609 --> 01:28:28,118
It's, uh, 587...

951
01:28:28,280 --> 01:28:30,786
2288.

952
01:29:12,157 --> 01:29:14,639
- You seen your sister?
- No.

953
01:29:24,305 --> 01:29:26,513
Give me that.

954
01:29:26,673 --> 01:29:28,052
Who's this?

955
01:29:28,209 --> 01:29:30,850
- Put Lucie on the phone.
- What?

956
01:29:31,010 --> 01:29:33,722
Put Lucie on the phone.

957
01:29:33,882 --> 01:29:36,056
You asshole.

958
01:29:36,216 --> 01:29:37,594
- He's out there.
- What'd he say?

959
01:29:37,750 --> 01:29:40,700
- Who?
- He wants to speak to her.

960
01:29:40,855 --> 01:29:42,199
Why Ma?

961
01:29:42,356 --> 01:29:44,862
- Who wants to talk to me?
- Where's the keys?

962
01:29:57,571 --> 01:30:01,112
Where are we going?
You want me to pack my bag?

963
01:30:01,275 --> 01:30:02,847
Where's the keys?

964
01:30:16,558 --> 01:30:19,406
- What's going on, you guys?
- Where's the keys?

965
01:30:19,563 --> 01:30:23,138
Rhino? Rhino,
where are we going, man?

966
01:30:24,600 --> 01:30:25,601
Hello?

967
01:30:25,768 --> 01:30:28,876
- Ask 'em what they did to Little Anne.
- What?

968
01:30:29,037 --> 01:30:31,041
Ask 'em what they did
to your daughter.

969
01:30:32,074 --> 01:30:35,993
Some- somebody said, "Ask them
what they did to your daughter."

970
01:30:36,146 --> 01:30:38,149
I didn't do nothing. Rhino--

971
01:30:38,314 --> 01:30:41,319
- He killed a goddamn cop.
- Well, I had to.

972
01:30:41,483 --> 01:30:43,831
This- this guy said, "Ask them--"

973
01:30:43,986 --> 01:30:45,762
- Who-- who-
- Ma.

974
01:30:45,921 --> 01:30:47,925
He killed Little Anne.

975
01:30:49,057 --> 01:30:50,503
Ma, she's gone.

976
01:30:59,068 --> 01:31:01,072
What are you saying?

977
01:31:02,237 --> 01:31:04,184
I'm sorry.

978
01:31:08,510 --> 01:31:11,619
Little Anne--
she ain't coming back.

979
01:31:11,779 --> 01:31:14,162
She-- that's my baby.

980
01:31:14,318 --> 01:31:15,958
He said she made
the cops come around.

981
01:31:16,120 --> 01:31:17,930
- That's my little baby!
- And he made me go with him,

982
01:31:18,088 --> 01:31:21,094
- but he did all the killing.
- That's my little baby!

983
01:31:21,258 --> 01:31:24,105
He made me, Ma!

984
01:31:24,261 --> 01:31:26,765
Don't touch me!
That is my baby!

985
01:31:26,929 --> 01:31:28,309
He made me.

986
01:31:32,937 --> 01:31:35,179
Damn it. Ah!

987
01:31:49,485 --> 01:31:53,027
No!

988
01:32:40,871 --> 01:32:42,614
Do it.

989
01:33:45,672 --> 01:33:48,087
We got him!

990
01:36:00,778 --> 01:36:04,558
- Do you want to look?
- No.

991
01:37:11,316 --> 01:37:13,319
Anne?

992
01:37:15,822 --> 01:37:17,564
Anne?

993
01:37:23,795 --> 01:37:25,571
You ready?
