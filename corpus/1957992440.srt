1
00:02:27,882 --> 00:02:29,415
- Ouch!

2
00:02:29,751 --> 00:02:30,817
Oh my god.

3
00:03:04,251 --> 00:03:05,685
- Hey.

4
00:03:05,687 --> 00:03:07,252
I see you're running
every morning.

5
00:03:07,254 --> 00:03:08,286
I wanted to know,
maybe we can work out

6
00:03:08,288 --> 00:03:09,823
one of these days together.

7
00:03:11,159 --> 00:03:13,258
- No, thank you though,
have a good day.

8
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:14,695
- You too.

9
00:03:37,384 --> 00:03:39,753
- Amari, baby, you up?

10
00:03:47,227 --> 00:03:48,293
Amari.

11
00:03:52,834 --> 00:03:54,000
Get up.

12
00:04:11,819 --> 00:04:13,284
Right on time.

13
00:04:13,286 --> 00:04:14,019
Good morning, my love.

14
00:04:14,021 --> 00:04:15,386
- Good morning.

15
00:04:15,388 --> 00:04:16,823
- Happy birthday.

16
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:21,661
How do you feel?

17
00:04:23,197 --> 00:04:24,530
- Old.

18
00:04:24,532 --> 00:04:26,297
Well, you look the same.

19
00:04:27,168 --> 00:04:28,568
- Thanks, Q.

20
00:04:30,403 --> 00:04:31,269
Do I smell bacon?

21
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:32,403
- Yes.

22
00:04:32,405 --> 00:04:33,539
- Oh.

23
00:04:33,541 --> 00:04:35,074
- And French toast.

24
00:04:35,076 --> 00:04:36,576
- Oh!

25
00:04:41,716 --> 00:04:44,683
- Welcome to the
"Dirty 30 Club."

26
00:04:44,685 --> 00:04:47,452
- Oh, oh my God.

27
00:04:47,454 --> 00:04:48,554
Can I rescind my offer?

28
00:04:48,556 --> 00:04:50,724
- No, silly, you can't.

29
00:04:53,094 --> 00:04:56,028
I know you wanted pancakes
but this is what they had.

30
00:04:57,865 --> 00:04:59,833
The rest of the day
will go as planned.

31
00:05:01,401 --> 00:05:02,803
And that reminds me,

32
00:05:04,138 --> 00:05:05,370
I have a list of some things
I need you to pick up.

33
00:05:05,372 --> 00:05:07,039
Just a few things

34
00:05:07,041 --> 00:05:08,373
but I think it'll be
good for you to do that.

35
00:05:08,375 --> 00:05:09,810
You know, get some air,

36
00:05:10,878 --> 00:05:13,512
take shower, put
on some clothes,

37
00:05:13,514 --> 00:05:15,582
get some exercise in.

38
00:05:16,517 --> 00:05:18,284
- Okay.

39
00:05:19,554 --> 00:05:20,653
- Oh, guess what?

40
00:05:20,655 --> 00:05:22,788
- What?

41
00:05:22,790 --> 00:05:25,490
- A driver is coming to
meet us at 9AM tomorrow.

42
00:05:25,492 --> 00:05:26,559
- To go where?

43
00:05:26,561 --> 00:05:28,426
- It's a surprise.

44
00:05:28,428 --> 00:05:30,931
I planned a whole
weekend getaway for us.

45
00:05:31,265 --> 00:05:32,665
Gonna be blast.

46
00:05:32,667 --> 00:05:34,000
- Great.

47
00:05:36,804 --> 00:05:37,468
- Ah!

48
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:38,972
Shit.

49
00:05:39,472 --> 00:05:41,273
Amari, baby,

50
00:05:41,275 --> 00:05:44,143
These damn earrings are
going to be the death of me.

51
00:05:44,145 --> 00:05:46,078
You need to start taking
care of your things.

52
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:47,880
What if this were expensive

53
00:05:47,882 --> 00:05:49,982
or a family heirloom
or something?

54
00:05:49,984 --> 00:05:51,651
Luckily, they're fake.

55
00:05:52,119 --> 00:05:53,418
- Sorry.

56
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:54,888
- So here's the deal.

57
00:05:55,623 --> 00:05:58,591
The caterer will arrive at five,

58
00:05:58,593 --> 00:06:01,760
our friends should come
for dinner around seven

59
00:06:01,762 --> 00:06:03,930
for a party of eight,
which will include

60
00:06:04,165 --> 00:06:05,430
Sam...

61
00:06:05,432 --> 00:06:06,933
and...

62
00:06:07,301 --> 00:06:08,902
Glenn,

63
00:06:09,570 --> 00:06:11,972
Tess and Shelly

64
00:06:12,573 --> 00:06:14,975
and Philip and Serenity.

65
00:06:16,210 --> 00:06:19,445
Though they may not
show up because, well...

66
00:06:22,049 --> 00:06:23,984
Philip asked me to be
his divorce lawyer.

67
00:06:24,518 --> 00:06:25,284
- Really?

68
00:06:25,286 --> 00:06:26,752
- Yeah.

69
00:06:26,754 --> 00:06:27,920
Gratefully, they
don't have kids,

70
00:06:27,922 --> 00:06:30,455
which I think is what
this is all about.

71
00:06:30,457 --> 00:06:33,125
Serenity not wanting
them and lying about

72
00:06:33,127 --> 00:06:34,994
not being on birth control
when she really was.

73
00:06:34,996 --> 00:06:36,495
Phillip's a mess.

74
00:06:37,531 --> 00:06:39,398
12, 13 years.

75
00:06:40,201 --> 00:06:42,002
I hope they work it out.

76
00:06:52,713 --> 00:06:53,812
- Do we have to have this party?

77
00:06:53,814 --> 00:06:55,748
- You only turn 30 once.

78
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:59,753
- I know but there's just
nothing to celebrate.

79
00:07:01,589 --> 00:07:04,089
- Another year of life is.

80
00:07:04,091 --> 00:07:05,992
Another day, another
minute, even.

81
00:07:09,797 --> 00:07:10,997
- I'm just not in the mood.

82
00:07:12,366 --> 00:07:13,900
- Okay.

83
00:07:14,135 --> 00:07:15,502
What's wrong?

84
00:07:16,504 --> 00:07:17,904
Talk to me.

85
00:07:21,542 --> 00:07:22,943
- I just feel like I'm

86
00:07:24,078 --> 00:07:25,979
further from my purpose
than I want to be.

87
00:07:27,248 --> 00:07:29,082
- Purpose, what, what's that?

88
00:07:29,517 --> 00:07:30,983
- I don't know.

89
00:07:30,985 --> 00:07:32,184
That's my point.

90
00:07:32,186 --> 00:07:34,286
- Amari,

91
00:07:34,288 --> 00:07:37,222
my point is, you don't have
to have it all figured out.

92
00:07:37,224 --> 00:07:40,392
Some people search their whole
lifetimes for their purpose.

93
00:07:40,394 --> 00:07:42,328
- Says a guy who's about
to be the youngest partner

94
00:07:42,330 --> 00:07:44,697
at his firm at the age of 35.

95
00:07:44,699 --> 00:07:46,665
Isn't today the big day?

96
00:07:46,667 --> 00:07:48,935
- Mm-hmm, and it hasn't
happened just yet.

97
00:07:50,204 --> 00:07:53,073
But let's discuss you

98
00:07:54,075 --> 00:07:56,843
and your plan after
our getaway, yeah?

99
00:07:57,845 --> 00:07:59,511
- We could use some fun.

100
00:07:59,513 --> 00:08:01,648
- Yes, we could.

101
00:08:03,084 --> 00:08:04,783
- At least tell me
where we're going.

102
00:08:04,785 --> 00:08:06,719
- It's a surprise.

103
00:08:06,721 --> 00:08:09,121
You'll know tomorrow morning
when the driver comes.

104
00:08:09,123 --> 00:08:10,189
- Well, how am I
supposed to pack?

105
00:08:10,191 --> 00:08:12,157
Is there gonna be a beach?

106
00:08:12,159 --> 00:08:14,593
- Yes, it's
a whole island.

107
00:08:14,595 --> 00:08:15,894
- Q, I don't feel like
getting on a plane.

108
00:08:15,896 --> 00:08:17,630
- Amari, there's
no plane involved.

109
00:08:19,133 --> 00:08:21,901
- Just tell me where
we're going, please.

110
00:08:24,271 --> 00:08:26,005
- Baby, you know I hate
keeping secrets from you

111
00:08:26,007 --> 00:08:27,840
but this one is
one that I have to

112
00:08:27,842 --> 00:08:30,142
and that is the plan.

113
00:08:30,144 --> 00:08:32,178
- You and these plans.

114
00:08:33,614 --> 00:08:35,714
At least tell me there's
gonna be bike riding.

115
00:08:35,716 --> 00:08:39,351
- Long bike rides
up down the beach.

116
00:08:39,353 --> 00:08:40,953
All your favorite activities

117
00:08:40,955 --> 00:08:43,089
have been organized
and scheduled.

118
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:47,193
Ooh.

119
00:08:52,166 --> 00:08:54,666
- Thank you.

120
00:08:54,668 --> 00:08:56,769
Thank you for making this old
man feel good on his birthday,

121
00:08:56,771 --> 00:08:58,238
even though I told you not to.

122
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:00,672
- Eat babe.

123
00:09:05,546 --> 00:09:06,780
- Hey, Nana.

124
00:09:08,849 --> 00:09:10,716
Oh no, I'm good, I'm good.

125
00:09:10,718 --> 00:09:12,251
I'm just having
breakfast in bed.

126
00:09:12,253 --> 00:09:13,787
Thank you.

127
00:09:14,588 --> 00:09:16,922
Yeah, he's here.

128
00:09:16,924 --> 00:09:19,024
Yeah, he's getting ready
for his big interview.

129
00:09:19,026 --> 00:09:21,193
Yeah, I hope he gets it too.

130
00:09:21,195 --> 00:09:23,730
Nana sends her
prayers or whatever.

131
00:09:24,732 --> 00:09:26,666
Oh, okay.

132
00:09:27,001 --> 00:09:28,301
Here.

133
00:09:29,103 --> 00:09:30,335
- Eat, baby.

134
00:09:30,337 --> 00:09:32,238
Hi, good morning.

135
00:09:32,673 --> 00:09:35,774
How are, uh-huh.

136
00:09:35,776 --> 00:09:37,109
Hey look, I'm sorry
I didn't get a chance

137
00:09:37,111 --> 00:09:39,512
to text you last
night, we had a late...

138
00:09:39,514 --> 00:09:41,613
Oh, nothing, nothing like that.

139
00:09:41,615 --> 00:09:43,116
Yeah.

140
00:09:43,284 --> 00:09:44,784
Okay.

141
00:09:46,587 --> 00:09:48,088
Well I'll let you know how
it goes today, all right?

142
00:09:48,189 --> 00:09:49,288
Okay.

143
00:09:49,290 --> 00:09:50,289
I'll talk to you later.

144
00:09:50,291 --> 00:09:51,223
Love you.

145
00:09:51,225 --> 00:09:52,759
Bye.

146
00:09:55,096 --> 00:09:56,596
- Yep.

147
00:09:57,631 --> 00:09:58,597
Oh.

148
00:09:58,599 --> 00:10:00,066
No, nothing yet.

149
00:10:01,435 --> 00:10:03,135
Go back to school, Nana,

150
00:10:03,137 --> 00:10:05,572
I am in way too
much debt already

151
00:10:05,574 --> 00:10:07,340
and I don't even
want to be a doctor.

152
00:10:08,676 --> 00:10:10,709
A dentist?

153
00:10:12,913 --> 00:10:15,447
No, I'll figure it out.

154
00:10:15,449 --> 00:10:17,250
Yes, I know I'm getting older.

155
00:10:18,752 --> 00:10:19,852
Oh.

156
00:10:19,854 --> 00:10:21,788
Oh, maybe this card is from you.

157
00:10:29,697 --> 00:10:33,298
Nana, no, this is way too much.

158
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:36,236
No, thank you, I appreciate
it but this is far too much.

159
00:10:38,005 --> 00:10:40,173
Yes, I read the card!

160
00:10:42,910 --> 00:10:45,578
Nana, now you know that I
cannot believe in anything

161
00:10:45,580 --> 00:10:47,680
that I cannot touch or see.

162
00:10:50,117 --> 00:10:52,718
Okay.

163
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:53,886
Well, I'm gonna let you go,
I'm trying to finish breakfast

164
00:10:53,888 --> 00:10:56,389
and I want to get him
nice and full, you know?

165
00:10:57,592 --> 00:11:00,260
Ew, no, not like that.

166
00:11:01,996 --> 00:11:02,728
Okay, all right, I love you
too, I'll talk to you later.

167
00:11:02,730 --> 00:11:03,662
All right.

168
00:11:03,664 --> 00:11:04,730
Bye.

169
00:11:04,732 --> 00:11:06,533
- Bye, Nana.

170
00:11:06,535 --> 00:11:08,901
- Ugh, she needs to stop
worrying about our sex life

171
00:11:08,903 --> 00:11:10,936
and focus more on hers.

172
00:11:10,938 --> 00:11:12,605
- At least she has one.

173
00:11:12,607 --> 00:11:14,139
- Gross.

174
00:11:14,141 --> 00:11:15,407
Is that what y'all text about?

175
00:11:15,409 --> 00:11:16,341
- Not entirely.

176
00:11:16,343 --> 00:11:18,177
- Ew, ew.

177
00:11:18,179 --> 00:11:20,513
- If you must know, Nana
has some gentlemen suitors.

178
00:11:20,515 --> 00:11:23,348
- Oh, I don't even wanna
think about Nana getting some

179
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:26,218
or whatever "some"
is at her age.

180
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:27,186
- The truth is the truth.

181
00:11:27,188 --> 00:11:28,688
- Mmm.

182
00:11:30,257 --> 00:11:34,226
Maybe I should become
Dr. Amari Lewis.

183
00:11:34,228 --> 00:11:35,994
- I mean,

184
00:11:35,996 --> 00:11:37,764
it does sound pretty good.

185
00:11:39,033 --> 00:11:40,800
You know what
sounds even better?

186
00:11:41,570 --> 00:11:44,002
Dr. Amari Nichols

187
00:11:44,004 --> 00:11:47,507
and Q Nichols, Esquire,

188
00:11:47,509 --> 00:11:50,410
partner at Bedford and Brockton.

189
00:11:51,378 --> 00:11:53,513
- I can see Nana now.

190
00:11:53,515 --> 00:11:56,849
"Look at my boys, the
lawyer and the dentist."

191
00:11:57,451 --> 00:11:58,885
You know,

192
00:11:59,654 --> 00:12:01,186
I am...

193
00:12:01,188 --> 00:12:02,455
just like,

194
00:12:04,024 --> 00:12:06,092
I only got like a year
left of dental school.

195
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:08,394
Maybe I could reapply.

196
00:12:10,130 --> 00:12:11,598
But it is super competitive.

197
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:12,966
- It's simple.

198
00:12:14,134 --> 00:12:16,769
Decide who you're going
to be, then be it.

199
00:12:17,838 --> 00:12:19,805
Do it and then you'll have it.

200
00:12:19,807 --> 00:12:21,139
Q,

201
00:12:21,141 --> 00:12:22,475
partner,

202
00:12:23,344 --> 00:12:24,511
that's who I want to be.

203
00:12:26,847 --> 00:12:27,813
- Hmm.

204
00:12:27,815 --> 00:12:29,682
- So,

205
00:12:29,684 --> 00:12:31,451
are we having this party or not?

206
00:12:33,722 --> 00:12:35,187
- I mean, you went through
all this trouble planning it.

207
00:12:35,189 --> 00:12:36,589
I don't wanna
disappoint anybody.

208
00:12:36,591 --> 00:12:39,459
- I mean, I could let the
people know you, you know,

209
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:41,960
had diarrhea or something.

210
00:12:41,962 --> 00:12:43,929
Maybe that'll convince
them not to show up.

211
00:12:47,034 --> 00:12:48,834
- It's very hard to
say no to you, Q.

212
00:12:48,836 --> 00:12:50,302
- Good.

213
00:12:50,304 --> 00:12:51,505
So don't.

214
00:12:52,273 --> 00:12:54,173
I have another surprise for you.

215
00:12:55,577 --> 00:12:57,276
- Surprise, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no, no.

216
00:12:57,278 --> 00:13:00,379
I said I didn't want any
gifts, any more surprises,

217
00:13:00,381 --> 00:13:01,547
I don't deserve it.

218
00:13:01,549 --> 00:13:03,850
- It's as much for
me as it is for you.

219
00:13:08,389 --> 00:13:11,156
I said I wanted to
be partner by 35

220
00:13:11,158 --> 00:13:14,794
and partner by 35...

221
00:13:15,829 --> 00:13:19,065
and husband and father by 40.

222
00:13:20,301 --> 00:13:22,802
I want to spend the rest
of my life with you.

223
00:13:23,772 --> 00:13:25,905
Will you do me the honor

224
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:29,909
of letting me call
you my husband?

225
00:13:33,515 --> 00:13:35,180
- We said we wouldn't
pop the question

226
00:13:35,182 --> 00:13:37,450
on birthdays or holidays.

227
00:13:38,252 --> 00:13:39,351
- I know.

228
00:13:39,353 --> 00:13:40,687
I bought the ring a while ago.

229
00:13:40,689 --> 00:13:43,088
Mexico, really,

230
00:13:43,090 --> 00:13:45,257
but then that thing
happened and it just

231
00:13:45,259 --> 00:13:47,493
never seemed like to
be the right time.

232
00:13:50,831 --> 00:13:53,165
I was going to do it later
on tonight during karaoke

233
00:13:53,167 --> 00:13:55,502
and Nana even thought it
was a good idea but...

234
00:13:59,574 --> 00:14:01,107
- I just need some time.

235
00:14:02,309 --> 00:14:04,110
Can I take the day
to figure it out?

236
00:14:09,350 --> 00:14:10,550
- What is there to figure out

237
00:14:10,552 --> 00:14:12,050
unless you don't want
to be my husband?

238
00:14:12,052 --> 00:14:13,553
- Well, how can
I be your husband

239
00:14:13,555 --> 00:14:14,587
if I don't have
anything to offer you?

240
00:14:14,589 --> 00:14:16,321
I have no plan,

241
00:14:16,323 --> 00:14:17,389
no job,

242
00:14:17,391 --> 00:14:19,224
no purpose.

243
00:14:19,226 --> 00:14:21,893
- Amari, a job doesn't
define your purpose.

244
00:14:21,895 --> 00:14:23,328
- That's easy for you to say.

245
00:14:23,330 --> 00:14:24,597
I'm sure you have
your whole future

246
00:14:24,599 --> 00:14:27,199
and funeral detailed
and designed.

247
00:14:27,201 --> 00:14:29,001
- I don't have it
planned that far.

248
00:14:30,404 --> 00:14:32,572
- I don't even have
any responsibilities.

249
00:14:32,574 --> 00:14:34,172
- You don't
take responsibility.

250
00:14:34,174 --> 00:14:36,542
- I don't have to pay any bills.

251
00:14:36,544 --> 00:14:37,943
I don't even...

252
00:14:37,945 --> 00:14:40,078
Ugh.

253
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:44,050
- I can take care of us,
I like taking care of us.

254
00:14:45,587 --> 00:14:47,953
And if you must know,

255
00:14:47,955 --> 00:14:49,221
I have an emergency
stash just in case

256
00:14:49,223 --> 00:14:51,625
you want to go back to school,

257
00:14:51,659 --> 00:14:53,726
dentist.

258
00:14:53,728 --> 00:14:55,227
- I haven't even
had my teeth cleaned

259
00:14:55,229 --> 00:14:57,195
in the last year, I don't
even have dental insurance.

260
00:14:57,197 --> 00:14:59,532
- Well, if you said "yes",
I can put you on my plan.

261
00:14:59,534 --> 00:15:01,501
- I don't wanna say
"yes" out of convenience.

262
00:15:01,503 --> 00:15:03,002
- Say "yes" out of love.

263
00:15:06,006 --> 00:15:08,808
There will always be...

264
00:15:08,810 --> 00:15:10,610
pits...

265
00:15:10,612 --> 00:15:12,311
and peaks...

266
00:15:12,781 --> 00:15:14,280
and...

267
00:15:16,049 --> 00:15:17,382
I know that I want to
go through those pits

268
00:15:17,384 --> 00:15:19,051
and those peaks with you.

269
00:15:20,921 --> 00:15:22,455
And all I'm asking

270
00:15:23,725 --> 00:15:26,660
is that you think about

271
00:15:28,195 --> 00:15:30,396
going on those pits
and peaks with me.

272
00:15:37,739 --> 00:15:38,905
Shit!

273
00:15:38,907 --> 00:15:40,674
I'm late.

274
00:15:42,209 --> 00:15:43,876
We'll talk about
it when I get back.

275
00:15:43,878 --> 00:15:45,512
Is that a plan?

276
00:15:49,717 --> 00:15:51,250
- Yeah.

277
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:54,487
- Good.

278
00:15:55,723 --> 00:15:57,190
How do I look?

279
00:16:00,762 --> 00:16:02,128
- Bomb.

280
00:16:03,964 --> 00:16:07,333
I've always loved you in pink.

281
00:16:09,504 --> 00:16:11,003
- Mmm.

282
00:16:17,478 --> 00:16:19,011
Take the day.

283
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:21,548
We'll talk about
this when I get back.

284
00:16:23,785 --> 00:16:25,318
Oh!

285
00:16:25,787 --> 00:16:27,587
Before I forget.

286
00:16:27,589 --> 00:16:28,386
These are the few
things I need you

287
00:16:28,388 --> 00:16:30,690
to pick up from this store.

288
00:16:30,692 --> 00:16:33,392
- You said a few items, this
is a whole list of stuff.

289
00:16:34,027 --> 00:16:35,529
- Responsibility.

290
00:16:36,430 --> 00:16:38,063
- Okay.

291
00:16:38,065 --> 00:16:39,999
- Now, come on, get up.

292
00:16:40,502 --> 00:16:41,601
Let me show you
this living room.

293
00:16:44,672 --> 00:16:46,304
So,

294
00:16:46,306 --> 00:16:48,341
I might have gone all out.

295
00:16:51,813 --> 00:16:53,846
I laid out everything.

296
00:16:53,848 --> 00:16:56,047
The caterer's gonna set up
a table of eight over here,

297
00:16:56,049 --> 00:16:57,717
kind of on a diagonal,

298
00:16:57,719 --> 00:17:00,686
and then we move the coffee
table into the bedroom

299
00:17:00,688 --> 00:17:03,689
and then we move this table
over when it's time for games,

300
00:17:03,691 --> 00:17:06,124
a little karaoke and
opening up your presents.

301
00:17:06,126 --> 00:17:08,027
Sounds fun, right?

302
00:17:09,998 --> 00:17:11,363
Let me know how you're feeling.

303
00:17:11,365 --> 00:17:12,865
Use your words, babe.

304
00:17:12,867 --> 00:17:14,300
- It's...

305
00:17:14,736 --> 00:17:16,135
It's a bit much.

306
00:17:18,006 --> 00:17:19,540
- Okay?

307
00:17:21,009 --> 00:17:23,475
Well, I'll scale it back when
I get home a little later.

308
00:17:23,477 --> 00:17:25,344
You like the colors
at least, yeah?

309
00:17:26,748 --> 00:17:29,115
- Yes, yes, I like the
colors a whole lot.

310
00:17:30,284 --> 00:17:32,553
I appreciate everything
you're doing for me.

311
00:17:35,188 --> 00:17:36,054
- You're welcome.

312
00:17:36,056 --> 00:17:37,624
You deserve it.

313
00:17:39,561 --> 00:17:40,893
Uh-uh.

314
00:17:40,895 --> 00:17:41,894
- Well, you better get going.

315
00:17:41,896 --> 00:17:43,429
- You're right.

316
00:17:44,799 --> 00:17:46,465
Next time you see me,

317
00:17:46,968 --> 00:17:48,702
maybe I'll be a partner

318
00:17:49,236 --> 00:17:51,003
and your partner.

319
00:17:51,839 --> 00:17:53,171
Bye.

320
00:17:53,173 --> 00:17:54,139
- Have a good day, love you.

321
00:17:54,141 --> 00:17:55,509
- Love you too.

322
00:18:06,219 --> 00:18:07,721
Did you just hear that?

323
00:18:09,289 --> 00:18:10,656
- Yeah, what was that?

324
00:18:12,259 --> 00:18:15,360
- "Stay inside.

325
00:18:15,362 --> 00:18:19,765
"There's been an unknown
explosion in the area."

326
00:18:19,767 --> 00:18:23,269
- Explosion, what
kind of explosion?

327
00:18:25,439 --> 00:18:26,471
I don't know but I
need to call Nana.

328
00:18:26,473 --> 00:18:28,174
- I need to call the office.

329
00:18:38,318 --> 00:18:39,351
My phone isn't working.

330
00:18:39,353 --> 00:18:40,721
- Mine neither.

331
00:18:44,826 --> 00:18:46,025
- Oh, I'm scared.

332
00:18:46,027 --> 00:18:47,093
- Mmm.

333
00:18:47,095 --> 00:18:49,729
Me too.

334
00:18:49,731 --> 00:18:50,696
- If you're
tuning into this broadcast,

335
00:18:50,698 --> 00:18:54,600
God bless you and
God bless America.

336
00:18:54,602 --> 00:18:57,803
I come to you with tragic
news in New York City.

337
00:18:57,805 --> 00:19:01,807
An unidentified blast has
devastated Time Square.

338
00:19:01,809 --> 00:19:04,476
Authorities have yet to
confirm the extent of damage

339
00:19:04,478 --> 00:19:07,747
or the parties responsible
for the attack.

340
00:19:07,749 --> 00:19:10,049
Mayor Watts has issued
a mandatory lockdown

341
00:19:10,051 --> 00:19:12,785
for at least the next 24 hours.

342
00:19:12,787 --> 00:19:14,655
We recommend locating
your emergency...

343
00:19:20,528 --> 00:19:22,094
- What just happened?

344
00:19:22,096 --> 00:19:23,329
- I think we lost power.

345
00:19:24,132 --> 00:19:25,565
- Oh God.

346
00:19:27,167 --> 00:19:28,835
Is this 9-11 all over again?

347
00:19:29,971 --> 00:19:31,838
No internet, no food,

348
00:19:32,272 --> 00:19:34,106
no power,

349
00:19:34,108 --> 00:19:35,642
no phones.

350
00:19:39,047 --> 00:19:40,881
And today of all days.

351
00:19:42,349 --> 00:19:43,983
How are we supposed to survive?

352
00:19:43,985 --> 00:19:45,384
- Do you have a plan?

353
00:19:47,522 --> 00:19:49,421
- Who plans for emergencies?

354
00:19:49,423 --> 00:19:51,489
At least not this...

355
00:19:51,491 --> 00:19:53,325
- Do we have an emergency kit?

356
00:19:54,562 --> 00:19:56,361
- No.

357
00:19:56,363 --> 00:19:57,898
No, we don't.

358
00:20:00,635 --> 00:20:02,001
Should we hide in the closet?

359
00:20:02,003 --> 00:20:03,836
- Um.

360
00:20:03,838 --> 00:20:05,672
- Maybe we should
hide in the closet.

361
00:20:08,308 --> 00:20:09,642
She said "attack", right?

362
00:20:09,644 --> 00:20:11,578
Was it a bomb, is the air safe?

363
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:15,280
I told you to clean this
closet out months ago!

364
00:20:15,282 --> 00:20:17,516
I think only one of us can fit.

365
00:20:17,518 --> 00:20:20,019
- I think I have, like, a
radio or something in here.

366
00:20:20,021 --> 00:20:21,419
- Too bad there's so
much stuff in there.

367
00:20:25,993 --> 00:20:27,426
- Jackpot.

368
00:20:30,765 --> 00:20:32,798
- What about our
friends downtown?

369
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:33,933
If it was in the other
cities, I don't know.

370
00:20:33,935 --> 00:20:34,900
Chicago.

371
00:20:34,902 --> 00:20:37,002
Nana!

372
00:20:37,004 --> 00:20:39,471
- You know, maybe we should
just focus on us right now.

373
00:20:39,473 --> 00:20:41,907
Perhaps you should just...

374
00:20:41,909 --> 00:20:43,609
pray or meditate or whatever
woo-woo thing you do

375
00:20:43,611 --> 00:20:45,945
to keep yourself calm.

376
00:20:45,947 --> 00:20:47,079
- Okay, you're right,
you're right, you're right.

377
00:20:47,081 --> 00:20:47,847
You're right.

378
00:20:47,849 --> 00:20:48,982
Breathe.

379
00:20:49,382 --> 00:20:50,884
Be grateful.

380
00:20:54,689 --> 00:20:56,354
- We need batteries.

381
00:20:56,356 --> 00:20:57,255
Maybe in the kitchen?

382
00:20:57,257 --> 00:20:58,925
- Yeah.

383
00:21:00,862 --> 00:21:01,392
What kind of
batteries do we need?

384
00:21:01,394 --> 00:21:03,328
- Double A.

385
00:21:03,330 --> 00:21:04,496
- How many?

386
00:21:04,498 --> 00:21:05,197
- Four.
- Found one.

387
00:21:05,199 --> 00:21:06,633
- Me too.

388
00:21:08,803 --> 00:21:11,369
- The TV remote uses
double A, right?

389
00:21:11,371 --> 00:21:11,971
- Yeah, good thinking.

390
00:21:11,973 --> 00:21:12,938
- See?

391
00:21:12,940 --> 00:21:14,273
We make a good team.

392
00:21:14,942 --> 00:21:16,475
Come on.

393
00:21:17,044 --> 00:21:19,211
Father,

394
00:21:19,213 --> 00:21:22,114
we come before You as
Your humble servants, God.

395
00:21:22,116 --> 00:21:24,917
We pray for strength,
we pray for courage.

396
00:21:24,919 --> 00:21:28,154
We pray for our family and
our friends, our colleagues,

397
00:21:28,156 --> 00:21:30,055
the first responders, God.

398
00:21:30,057 --> 00:21:32,423
We pray that these
batteries work, Jesus.

399
00:21:32,425 --> 00:21:33,927
Please, Lord.

400
00:21:36,197 --> 00:21:37,163
- Yes.

401
00:21:37,899 --> 00:21:38,731
- Amen.

402
00:21:38,733 --> 00:21:40,398
Woo.
- Get a signal.

403
00:21:42,435 --> 00:21:44,369
- Who would do such a thing?

404
00:21:44,371 --> 00:21:46,006
Who would hurt so many people?

405
00:21:47,041 --> 00:21:48,607
Woo.

406
00:21:48,609 --> 00:21:49,474
- Like Nana always says,

407
00:21:49,476 --> 00:21:51,277
"Man plans,

408
00:21:51,279 --> 00:21:52,545
"God laughs."

409
00:21:54,481 --> 00:21:55,614
- This is not an act of God.

410
00:21:55,616 --> 00:21:57,650
It's an act of terror.

411
00:21:57,652 --> 00:21:59,251
- Okay, all right, let's
not jump to conclusions.

412
00:21:59,253 --> 00:22:01,821
Let's just focus on
finding a working station.

413
00:22:04,158 --> 00:22:06,058
- Luckily I was running late.

414
00:22:06,060 --> 00:22:08,426
I would've been stuck down there

415
00:22:08,428 --> 00:22:12,098
and underground with
the rats in the dark.

416
00:22:13,801 --> 00:22:15,534
Away from you--
- We cannot take

417
00:22:15,536 --> 00:22:17,770
any moment for granted.
- On your birthday.

418
00:22:17,772 --> 00:22:20,673
- It can
all be gone in a second.

419
00:22:20,675 --> 00:22:24,375
Let us take a moment of
silence to honor the fallen.

420
00:22:24,377 --> 00:22:27,746
And we can now confirm that
there have not been reports

421
00:22:27,748 --> 00:22:29,248
of similar activities
in other cities

422
00:22:29,250 --> 00:22:30,683
around the world.
- Oh!

423
00:22:30,685 --> 00:22:31,482
Thank you, God.
- Emergency workers

424
00:22:31,484 --> 00:22:32,618
are on the scene.

425
00:22:32,620 --> 00:22:34,320
They are examining--

426
00:22:34,322 --> 00:22:36,722
- Hey, can you cut
that out a bit?

427
00:22:36,724 --> 00:22:38,257
- What?

428
00:22:38,259 --> 00:22:39,191
- All that God stuff.

429
00:22:39,193 --> 00:22:40,861
It's annoying.

430
00:22:41,929 --> 00:22:43,428
- When did you
become an atheist?

431
00:22:43,430 --> 00:22:44,395
- I just wanna deal
with what's real!

432
00:22:44,397 --> 00:22:46,465
- God is real.

433
00:22:47,535 --> 00:22:50,435
The Creator, whatever
you call "it",

434
00:22:50,437 --> 00:22:53,606
it's very real.

435
00:22:53,608 --> 00:22:55,875
- Q, I get that you have
this need to ground yourself

436
00:22:55,877 --> 00:23:00,079
in this idea of hope
but it isn't helping us.

437
00:23:02,382 --> 00:23:03,448
We don't even know what's
going on outside the door.

438
00:23:03,450 --> 00:23:04,817
There's other things
to worry about

439
00:23:04,819 --> 00:23:07,087
like food, water, supplies.

440
00:23:09,389 --> 00:23:11,190
I can't deal with this.

441
00:23:11,192 --> 00:23:12,959
- You never wanna
deal with anything.

442
00:23:14,662 --> 00:23:18,330
You always jump ship when
it's time to do something,

443
00:23:18,332 --> 00:23:20,431
to finish something.

444
00:23:20,433 --> 00:23:22,334
Say something!
- But like you said,

445
00:23:22,336 --> 00:23:25,037
if I need to be something,
I need to do something.

446
00:23:25,039 --> 00:23:28,140
- So be it then.
- What I won't be

447
00:23:28,142 --> 00:23:30,843
is this version of me you
have inside of your head.

448
00:23:30,845 --> 00:23:34,847
I am exhausted to living up
to your impossible standards.

449
00:23:34,849 --> 00:23:36,882
- What the fuck are
you talking about?

450
00:23:36,884 --> 00:23:40,019
- It always has to go your way.

451
00:23:40,021 --> 00:23:42,188
- Really?
- The way that you planned.

452
00:23:45,393 --> 00:23:47,093
- Okay.

453
00:23:47,762 --> 00:23:49,395
Wow.

454
00:23:49,397 --> 00:23:52,231
- It's suffocating.
- Really?

455
00:23:52,233 --> 00:23:55,334
So why haven't you said
anything all these years?

456
00:23:55,336 --> 00:23:57,703
- You aren't the most open
to other people's opinions.

457
00:23:57,705 --> 00:23:59,371
Always so quick to
criticize, especially me,

458
00:23:59,373 --> 00:24:01,508
if I'm not in alignment
with your plan!

459
00:24:01,542 --> 00:24:03,109
- Baby,

460
00:24:04,545 --> 00:24:06,146
we're on the same team.

461
00:24:06,948 --> 00:24:09,315
I only want what's best for you.

462
00:24:09,317 --> 00:24:11,583
- What's best for me is you not
down my throat all the time.

463
00:24:11,585 --> 00:24:13,520
- I thought you needed that.

464
00:24:15,455 --> 00:24:17,223
- We're in the
middle of a crisis.

465
00:24:17,825 --> 00:24:19,925
- Don't just walk away!

466
00:24:19,927 --> 00:24:22,896
- Can I have some space, please?

467
00:24:23,631 --> 00:24:25,198
- Here's your space.

468
00:24:29,770 --> 00:24:31,170
Too bad there's not much of it

469
00:24:31,172 --> 00:24:33,272
because you don't
wanna let go of shit.

470
00:24:33,274 --> 00:24:35,240
How do you expect
to invite new things

471
00:24:35,242 --> 00:24:36,575
if you keep on holding
on all of this stuff?

472
00:24:36,577 --> 00:24:38,111
Do you need this?

473
00:24:38,346 --> 00:24:39,411
Or this?

474
00:24:39,413 --> 00:24:40,947
Or...

475
00:24:41,048 --> 00:24:42,915
This?

476
00:24:42,917 --> 00:24:44,216
- You're
being outrageous.

477
00:24:44,218 --> 00:24:47,619
- I'm passionate
about this, about us!

478
00:24:47,621 --> 00:24:48,887
- All right, you can
have the living room.

479
00:24:48,889 --> 00:24:51,390
I'ma take the bedroom.

480
00:24:51,392 --> 00:24:54,259
- There's an attack happening
outside and you want space?

481
00:24:54,261 --> 00:24:56,196
That doesn't make sense.

482
00:25:00,835 --> 00:25:02,202
Am I enough for you, Amari?

483
00:25:04,105 --> 00:25:05,671
- Q, I just don't
wanna fight right now.

484
00:25:05,673 --> 00:25:07,206
- Do you wanna be with me?

485
00:25:07,208 --> 00:25:09,075
- I don't want to
fight right now, Q.

486
00:25:13,814 --> 00:25:16,148
- Fight for something.

487
00:25:16,150 --> 00:25:19,118
- All I'm asking for
is to go into that room

488
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:20,319
and have a moment
to catch my breath.

489
00:25:20,321 --> 00:25:22,054
That's all I'm asking for.

490
00:25:22,056 --> 00:25:23,256
Begging for.

491
00:25:25,626 --> 00:25:26,592
- Whatever.

492
00:25:26,594 --> 00:25:27,727
I'll make it easy.

493
00:25:29,063 --> 00:25:31,197
- Nothing is ever
easy with you, Q.

494
00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:35,168
- If I die out here, know
that I loved you to death.

495
00:26:04,031 --> 00:26:05,331
Fuck!

496
00:26:39,534 --> 00:26:41,233
I can't remember the last time
we did anything adventures.

497
00:26:41,235 --> 00:26:43,503
- Um...

498
00:26:43,505 --> 00:26:45,538
Mexico.

499
00:26:45,540 --> 00:26:48,208
But we both know
what happened next.

500
00:26:50,111 --> 00:26:53,113
- That's why I planned this
whole evening, this weekend.

501
00:26:54,048 --> 00:26:56,282
Now it's ruined by terrorists.

502
00:27:01,789 --> 00:27:03,923
- I haven't been
completely honest with you.

503
00:27:06,193 --> 00:27:07,360
- About what?

504
00:27:09,531 --> 00:27:11,264
- I've been feeling lonely.

505
00:27:11,799 --> 00:27:13,333
- Oh, well,

506
00:27:13,634 --> 00:27:15,335
me too.

507
00:27:15,769 --> 00:27:17,270
But I'm here.

508
00:27:18,339 --> 00:27:19,772
I've been here.

509
00:27:20,841 --> 00:27:22,741
- This just hasn't been
the best year for me,

510
00:27:22,743 --> 00:27:24,277
for us.

511
00:27:26,213 --> 00:27:28,181
I know it's my fault
we're in this pit.

512
00:27:28,649 --> 00:27:29,916
- No, it's not.

513
00:27:32,119 --> 00:27:33,319
I mean...

514
00:27:34,623 --> 00:27:35,487
It's no one's fault.

515
00:27:35,489 --> 00:27:37,290
- Yes it is.

516
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:40,425
I haven't been feeling like
doing much of anything.

517
00:27:40,427 --> 00:27:42,428
- Part of me feels the same way.

518
00:27:44,265 --> 00:27:45,665
- What's wrong?

519
00:27:47,501 --> 00:27:48,968
- I'm frustrated.

520
00:27:51,172 --> 00:27:52,738
- About?

521
00:27:52,740 --> 00:27:54,207
- About us.

522
00:27:58,112 --> 00:28:00,747
Something changed in Mexico.

523
00:28:01,616 --> 00:28:04,883
We haven't been the same since.

524
00:28:04,885 --> 00:28:06,218
- Yeah, I know.

525
00:28:06,220 --> 00:28:09,355
We've been stuck
in this routine.

526
00:28:14,161 --> 00:28:15,361
- Are you happy?

527
00:28:16,897 --> 00:28:18,363
- I have my moments.

528
00:28:18,365 --> 00:28:19,866
- No.

529
00:28:21,603 --> 00:28:23,403
Are you happy with me?

530
00:28:24,371 --> 00:28:25,871
- Q,

531
00:28:25,873 --> 00:28:28,073
I love you

532
00:28:28,075 --> 00:28:29,943
and nothing's ever
gonna change that.

533
00:28:31,045 --> 00:28:32,745
- Answer

534
00:28:33,247 --> 00:28:33,779
the question.

535
00:28:33,781 --> 00:28:35,448
- Yes.

536
00:28:36,450 --> 00:28:38,284
I'm happy with you.

537
00:28:39,753 --> 00:28:41,387
Are you happy with me?

538
00:28:43,924 --> 00:28:46,392
- Besides my friends,
you are all that I have.

539
00:28:50,798 --> 00:28:53,098
But I'm not happy in
this pit that we're in.

540
00:29:09,750 --> 00:29:12,384
- We will climb out of this pit.

541
00:29:12,386 --> 00:29:13,820
Together.

542
00:29:22,763 --> 00:29:26,366
Why don't we have some fun?

543
00:29:27,535 --> 00:29:28,935
Maybe play a game?

544
00:29:30,904 --> 00:29:33,138
- Do you think now is
the best time the games?

545
00:29:33,140 --> 00:29:34,774
- What else are we gonna do?

546
00:29:36,844 --> 00:29:39,479
- I mean, it is your birthday.

547
00:29:43,183 --> 00:29:45,217
Probably won't be having
this party after all.

548
00:29:45,219 --> 00:29:46,818
- Good.

549
00:29:46,820 --> 00:29:48,555
It's just what I wished for,

550
00:29:50,257 --> 00:29:53,226
to spend this moment with
the person I love the most.

551
00:29:55,796 --> 00:29:58,898
So you and I are
gonna play "Memories".

552
00:29:59,433 --> 00:30:00,299
- Memories?

553
00:30:00,301 --> 00:30:01,535
- Mm-hmm.

554
00:30:06,574 --> 00:30:08,206
So there are two photos
of specific moments

555
00:30:08,208 --> 00:30:10,175
of our time together.

556
00:30:10,177 --> 00:30:11,511
- Mm-hmm.
- Gonna shuffle them up

557
00:30:11,513 --> 00:30:14,212
and then spread
them out, face down,

558
00:30:14,214 --> 00:30:16,448
and the first person to get
the most matching pairs wins.

559
00:30:16,450 --> 00:30:17,750
What do I get when I win?

560
00:30:17,752 --> 00:30:19,520
- If you win.

561
00:30:20,220 --> 00:30:21,420
Get whatever you want.

562
00:30:21,422 --> 00:30:23,322
Winner's choice.

563
00:30:23,324 --> 00:30:25,357
- I like that.

564
00:30:25,359 --> 00:30:28,927
To raise the stakes,
when we locate a memory,

565
00:30:28,929 --> 00:30:31,330
we have to recall the
peak of that memory.

566
00:30:31,332 --> 00:30:33,131
- Oh, the highs.

567
00:30:33,133 --> 00:30:34,567
What about the lows?

568
00:30:34,569 --> 00:30:36,169
- We just focus on the good.

569
00:30:36,705 --> 00:30:38,437
- Okay then.

570
00:30:38,439 --> 00:30:39,706
Let's play.

571
00:30:39,708 --> 00:30:42,474
Oh, bop, bop, bop, bop!

572
00:30:42,476 --> 00:30:43,843
Rock, paper, scissors.

573
00:30:44,579 --> 00:30:45,545
- Best out of three?

574
00:30:45,547 --> 00:30:46,679
- Russian Roulette.

575
00:30:46,681 --> 00:30:48,081
- I love your style.

576
00:30:59,126 --> 00:31:00,860
- So why now?

577
00:31:00,928 --> 00:31:02,596
Why me?

578
00:31:02,930 --> 00:31:04,263
- I love you.

579
00:31:06,066 --> 00:31:07,834
- It's gotta be another
reason than love

580
00:31:07,836 --> 00:31:09,902
that would make
you wanna marry me.

581
00:31:10,270 --> 00:31:12,505
- Amari, look at you.

582
00:31:12,507 --> 00:31:14,040
You're gorgeous.

583
00:31:17,612 --> 00:31:19,411
I mean, I love other things too.

584
00:31:19,413 --> 00:31:22,180
- Like what?

585
00:31:22,182 --> 00:31:24,585
- When you're like
this, fun, playful.

586
00:31:26,387 --> 00:31:27,621
I asked you now

587
00:31:29,356 --> 00:31:31,090
because I want you to know
that I'm here for you,

588
00:31:31,693 --> 00:31:33,626
in the highs and the lows.

589
00:31:33,628 --> 00:31:35,060
- I just feel that
you're so attached

590
00:31:35,062 --> 00:31:36,228
to this vision of
being married by 40.

591
00:31:36,230 --> 00:31:37,764
- That's not true.

592
00:31:37,766 --> 00:31:39,932
And I know what I want.

593
00:31:47,341 --> 00:31:49,040
- Ooh!

594
00:31:49,042 --> 00:31:50,710
I remember this one.

595
00:31:50,712 --> 00:31:54,112
This is when we went hiking
upstate and we got lost

596
00:31:54,114 --> 00:31:55,381
but we worked together

597
00:31:57,050 --> 00:31:59,017
to retrace our footsteps
to get back to camp.

598
00:31:59,019 --> 00:32:00,753
- A bear chased us
through the forest.

599
00:32:00,755 --> 00:32:02,989
- That was Alvin, a chipmunk.

600
00:32:03,758 --> 00:32:06,592
- I remember Smokey the bear.

601
00:32:06,594 --> 00:32:09,027
Now you can remember what
you want to, and that's fine,

602
00:32:09,029 --> 00:32:09,961
I still have nightmares
about that damn trip

603
00:32:09,963 --> 00:32:11,029
out in the wild.

604
00:32:11,031 --> 00:32:12,899
Definitely a pit.

605
00:32:12,901 --> 00:32:14,466
- Oh, whatever,
there was no bear.

606
00:32:16,370 --> 00:32:17,671
- Ooh.

607
00:32:21,609 --> 00:32:22,909
- Okay.

608
00:32:22,911 --> 00:32:24,277
- Aw.
- Ooh.

609
00:32:25,613 --> 00:32:27,447
- I remember this trip.

610
00:32:28,850 --> 00:32:29,849
- You picked
me up and we drove

611
00:32:29,851 --> 00:32:31,818
to Atlantic City
for my birthday.

612
00:32:31,820 --> 00:32:34,286
- Mm-hmm, lucky number 33.

613
00:32:34,288 --> 00:32:35,922
- Won a thousand dollars.

614
00:32:35,924 --> 00:32:36,789
- And gave it back
to the casino.

615
00:32:36,791 --> 00:32:38,758
- You know I love gambling.

616
00:32:40,461 --> 00:32:43,195
I remember we ate
real good that night.

617
00:32:43,197 --> 00:32:44,963
- I don't remember
what we had for dinner.

618
00:32:44,965 --> 00:32:47,499
I just remember that
we shared plates

619
00:32:47,501 --> 00:32:49,034
and we had those chocolate
chip cookies for dessert.

620
00:32:49,036 --> 00:32:51,169
- Oh yes.

621
00:32:51,171 --> 00:32:52,839
With the sea salt
sprinkled on top.

622
00:32:52,841 --> 00:32:54,106
Ooh.
- Mmm.

623
00:32:54,876 --> 00:32:57,076
- Shit, I'm hungry now.

624
00:32:57,946 --> 00:32:59,312
- There's oatmeal.

625
00:33:00,748 --> 00:33:01,647
- Ugh, I hate oatmeal.

626
00:33:01,649 --> 00:33:03,549
- I know.

627
00:33:03,551 --> 00:33:04,518
I'm just playing.

628
00:33:05,653 --> 00:33:07,520
- That would suck.

629
00:33:07,522 --> 00:33:09,155
My last meal.

630
00:33:09,456 --> 00:33:11,122
Oatmeal.

631
00:33:11,124 --> 00:33:12,759
- Beggars can't be choosers.

632
00:33:13,260 --> 00:33:14,493
- I'd rather eat you.

633
00:33:14,495 --> 00:33:15,995
- Oh.

634
00:33:17,297 --> 00:33:20,198
I don't think I could
curve your appetite.

635
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:21,333
- Think you could
curve something else.

636
00:33:21,335 --> 00:33:22,969
- Ew, stop.
- Give it to me.

637
00:33:22,971 --> 00:33:23,636
- You were trying
to distract me.

638
00:33:23,638 --> 00:33:24,937
Quit.

639
00:33:24,939 --> 00:33:27,272
- Call it what you want.

640
00:33:47,629 --> 00:33:48,761
- Mmmm.

641
00:33:48,763 --> 00:33:50,196
Only one pair left.

642
00:33:51,064 --> 00:33:51,864
- How many do you have?

643
00:33:51,866 --> 00:33:53,366
- Six.

644
00:33:54,434 --> 00:33:56,435
- I have six too
and it's my turn.

645
00:33:56,938 --> 00:33:58,605
This one's for the win.

646
00:34:01,576 --> 00:34:03,074
- Mmm.

647
00:34:04,012 --> 00:34:05,143
I remember this one.

648
00:34:05,145 --> 00:34:06,111
- I'd rather not.

649
00:34:06,113 --> 00:34:07,312
- Oh, it's all right.

650
00:34:07,314 --> 00:34:09,782
It was Cancun and

651
00:34:09,784 --> 00:34:12,050
I was sick

652
00:34:12,052 --> 00:34:14,887
for three

653
00:34:14,889 --> 00:34:17,289
out of four days on this trip.

654
00:34:17,291 --> 00:34:20,359
I was shitting and
throwing up left and right.

655
00:34:20,895 --> 00:34:22,428
- Yeah.

656
00:34:23,230 --> 00:34:24,665
- What's wrong?

657
00:34:25,465 --> 00:34:26,866
Ugh.

658
00:34:26,868 --> 00:34:27,934
What's wrong?

659
00:34:27,936 --> 00:34:29,468
Come on.

660
00:34:33,841 --> 00:34:35,274
- I cheated.

661
00:34:36,544 --> 00:34:38,109
- Oh baby, the game is over.

662
00:34:38,111 --> 00:34:39,912
Come on.

663
00:34:39,914 --> 00:34:41,314
- In Mexico.

664
00:34:43,818 --> 00:34:45,251
I cheated.

665
00:34:48,890 --> 00:34:51,357
- It was the guy at the
front desk, wasn't it?

666
00:34:53,528 --> 00:34:55,327
Ugh.
- It was a mistake.

667
00:34:55,329 --> 00:34:57,296
A lapse in judgment.

668
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:03,569
- I was wondering why he
was being so friendly to you

669
00:35:03,571 --> 00:35:06,372
when I was being wheeled out
the front door by the bellman.

670
00:35:07,875 --> 00:35:10,376
You said you was gonna
propose me on that trip.

671
00:35:12,379 --> 00:35:14,245
- I know, I should've
told you sooner.

672
00:35:14,247 --> 00:35:15,649
- What stopped you?

673
00:35:16,551 --> 00:35:20,686
- You've been in
such a bad mood.

674
00:35:20,688 --> 00:35:22,622
- We went to Mexico
over a year ago.

675
00:35:22,624 --> 00:35:23,488
- And you've been disconnected
from me ever since.

676
00:35:23,490 --> 00:35:25,592
- And now I know why.

677
00:35:27,095 --> 00:35:28,595
Damn.

678
00:35:32,533 --> 00:35:34,400
- There's something else.

679
00:35:36,571 --> 00:35:37,570
- Shit, the bomb's
already dropped.

680
00:35:37,572 --> 00:35:39,270
If you got anything else to say,

681
00:35:39,272 --> 00:35:40,807
you might as well
let it out now.

682
00:35:47,849 --> 00:35:49,281
- I'm positive.

683
00:36:02,897 --> 00:36:04,531
- Am I at risk?

684
00:36:06,100 --> 00:36:08,233
- We always use protection

685
00:36:08,235 --> 00:36:10,569
and we haven't been doing
much of that anyways lately.

686
00:36:10,571 --> 00:36:12,437
And I wouldn't have sex with you

687
00:36:12,439 --> 00:36:13,539
until I knew that
I was undetectable.

688
00:36:13,541 --> 00:36:15,341
- And that makes it okay?

689
00:36:19,547 --> 00:36:21,313
I can't even look
at you right now.

690
00:36:34,729 --> 00:36:36,830
What else you been
keeping secret from me, Q?

691
00:36:38,265 --> 00:36:39,464
- I should be asking you
the same damn question!

692
00:36:39,466 --> 00:36:40,398
- Oh, so no I'm on the stand?

693
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:41,967
- You haven't been Mr. Perfect.

694
00:36:41,969 --> 00:36:43,836
- I haven't tried to be
and I also didn't break

695
00:36:43,838 --> 00:36:45,806
any of the boundaries
that we set!

696
00:36:51,546 --> 00:36:53,879
- I peeped your DMs.

697
00:36:53,881 --> 00:36:56,082
- Oh, Q, please,
you sound so stupid.

698
00:36:56,084 --> 00:36:57,382
- Oh yeah?

699
00:36:57,384 --> 00:36:59,552
I have receipts.

700
00:36:59,554 --> 00:37:01,053
- So let me get this
straight, defendant.

701
00:37:01,055 --> 00:37:03,089
You cheated on me over a
year ago and then you decide

702
00:37:03,091 --> 00:37:05,925
to pull out this bullshit ass
evidence as a way to do what?

703
00:37:05,927 --> 00:37:07,861
Make up for what a
fucking mess you are?

704
00:37:08,428 --> 00:37:10,863
- "You're so cute.

705
00:37:10,865 --> 00:37:13,599
"Oh, we should
hang out sometime.

706
00:37:13,601 --> 00:37:15,736
"Maybe you should
ask your boyfriend."

707
00:37:16,170 --> 00:37:17,302
- Q,

708
00:37:17,304 --> 00:37:20,106
you are reaching.

709
00:37:20,108 --> 00:37:22,775
We agreed to break up with
each other before cheating.

710
00:37:22,777 --> 00:37:24,944
- It just happened,
I didn't plan it.

711
00:37:24,946 --> 00:37:27,412
- That's a fucking surprise,
you plan everything else.

712
00:37:27,414 --> 00:37:29,347
Oh, wait.

713
00:37:29,349 --> 00:37:31,017
It must have been an emergency.

714
00:37:34,055 --> 00:37:36,421
- I need space.

715
00:37:36,423 --> 00:37:38,959
- If we weren't on lock down,
my ass would be out that door.

716
00:37:40,561 --> 00:37:41,459
- And where would you go?

717
00:37:41,461 --> 00:37:43,663
- Anywhere but here.

718
00:37:45,833 --> 00:37:48,568
- See how far that
$300 takes you.

719
00:37:49,504 --> 00:37:51,270
- Fuck you.

720
00:38:01,883 --> 00:38:03,049
- Amar.

721
00:38:04,886 --> 00:38:06,853
Amari, open up, please?

722
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:08,854
Please, baby.

723
00:38:08,856 --> 00:38:10,122
Don't shut me out.

724
00:38:10,124 --> 00:38:11,992
Amar, baby.

725
00:38:14,162 --> 00:38:15,862
Baby, please.

726
00:38:27,742 --> 00:38:29,676
- What do you want me to say?

727
00:38:31,311 --> 00:38:32,979
- Say anything.

728
00:38:36,349 --> 00:38:37,951
- There's nothing more to say.

729
00:38:40,588 --> 00:38:42,088
- Is that it?

730
00:38:43,724 --> 00:38:45,324
- What did you expect?

731
00:38:46,326 --> 00:38:47,694
A whole year?

732
00:38:49,496 --> 00:38:51,598
- This is too much.

733
00:38:53,701 --> 00:38:55,669
And cheating was
always a deal breaker.

734
00:38:58,539 --> 00:39:00,006
- Fight for us.

735
00:39:01,776 --> 00:39:03,109
For me.

736
00:39:03,978 --> 00:39:05,111
Please.

737
00:39:06,446 --> 00:39:08,347
- Ding, ding, ding.

738
00:39:08,549 --> 00:39:10,016
That's a K.O, Q.

739
00:39:13,921 --> 00:39:15,856
- Give me a chance,
I'm gonna make it right.

740
00:39:18,826 --> 00:39:20,125
Baby.

741
00:39:20,127 --> 00:39:22,393
- How are you going to do that?

742
00:39:22,395 --> 00:39:24,631
- I don't know, I don't
know but I'll try.

743
00:39:25,933 --> 00:39:27,801
- You should
journal about it.

744
00:39:30,037 --> 00:39:31,403
- Okay.

745
00:39:33,875 --> 00:39:35,040
We've been drinking,
we've been smoking.

746
00:39:35,042 --> 00:39:37,409
- I am very clear.

747
00:39:43,184 --> 00:39:44,416
- So that's it?

748
00:39:48,455 --> 00:39:50,090
Are you really
throwing in the towel?

749
00:40:01,802 --> 00:40:02,701
- Come on, baby, we
gotta lose these extra pounds

750
00:40:02,703 --> 00:40:04,770
we put on in Cancun.

751
00:40:04,772 --> 00:40:06,471
- You left five
of them in Mexico.

752
00:40:06,473 --> 00:40:08,173
- That's okay.

753
00:40:08,175 --> 00:40:09,375
I am here for moral support.

754
00:40:09,377 --> 00:40:11,043
- I'm tired.

755
00:40:11,045 --> 00:40:11,810
- Come on, we're
almost to our spot.

756
00:40:11,812 --> 00:40:13,146
- Babe.

757
00:40:13,547 --> 00:40:15,015
Oh, geez.

758
00:40:16,250 --> 00:40:17,751
Fuck.

759
00:40:17,952 --> 00:40:18,951
- Are you okay?

760
00:40:18,953 --> 00:40:20,686
- Yeah.

761
00:40:20,688 --> 00:40:22,354
- My clumsy boyfriend.

762
00:40:22,356 --> 00:40:22,554
Do I need to call
the paramedics?

763
00:40:22,556 --> 00:40:24,423
- Maybe.

764
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:27,626
Kiss it.

765
00:40:27,628 --> 00:40:29,195
Make it better.

766
00:40:30,064 --> 00:40:32,463
- There's nothing
wrong with you.

767
00:40:32,465 --> 00:40:34,800
You should have been a
performer instead of a lawyer.

768
00:40:34,802 --> 00:40:37,269
- Oh, my entire
job is performing.

769
00:40:37,271 --> 00:40:38,370
- So do you want your
Oscar now or later

770
00:40:38,372 --> 00:40:39,470
for being a divorce lawyer?

771
00:40:39,472 --> 00:40:41,040
- Now.

772
00:40:41,042 --> 00:40:42,875
Tomorrow's not promised.

773
00:40:42,877 --> 00:40:44,544
- Ooh, let's take a picture.

774
00:40:49,917 --> 00:40:52,384
- Hey, we do you need to talk

775
00:40:52,386 --> 00:40:53,652
about something.
- One second, babe.

776
00:40:53,654 --> 00:40:57,890
This is the perfect moment.

777
00:40:57,892 --> 00:40:59,124
Yes.

778
00:40:59,126 --> 00:41:00,125
Oh.

779
00:41:00,127 --> 00:41:01,194
Hold on, this is work.

780
00:41:02,396 --> 00:41:04,263
Hey.

781
00:41:04,265 --> 00:41:05,798
Hey, Tim, how's it going?

782
00:41:07,101 --> 00:41:08,834
Yeah, I'm back.

783
00:41:08,836 --> 00:41:11,704
Well, Q had more fun than I did.

784
00:41:11,706 --> 00:41:13,606
Yeah, I was sick for
most of the trip.

785
00:41:14,675 --> 00:41:16,609
I am better now,
thank you for asking.

786
00:41:18,980 --> 00:41:20,213
Oh, okay.

787
00:41:25,219 --> 00:41:26,586
Really?

788
00:41:28,189 --> 00:41:29,522
What about the promotion?

789
00:41:36,897 --> 00:41:38,198
Okay.

790
00:41:39,533 --> 00:41:40,900
No, I understand.

791
00:41:41,369 --> 00:41:42,634
Thank you.

792
00:41:42,636 --> 00:41:44,070
I appreciate that.

793
00:41:45,973 --> 00:41:47,173
Okay, yeah.

794
00:41:47,842 --> 00:41:49,275
I'll see you tomorrow.

795
00:41:57,084 --> 00:41:58,184
- Everything okay?

796
00:42:03,157 --> 00:42:04,657
- They cut my position

797
00:42:05,893 --> 00:42:06,925
and they're letting me go.

798
00:42:06,927 --> 00:42:09,461
- Babe, I'm so sorry.

799
00:42:09,463 --> 00:42:12,264
They were just promoting
you to director.

800
00:42:12,266 --> 00:42:14,234
- "This is a hard
time for the company."

801
00:42:15,269 --> 00:42:17,102
- You okay?

802
00:42:17,104 --> 00:42:18,771
I'll be fine.

803
00:42:18,773 --> 00:42:22,441
This isn't the first job I lost.

804
00:42:22,443 --> 00:42:23,442
- You didn't like
it there anyway.

805
00:42:23,444 --> 00:42:24,644
- I like the money.

806
00:42:26,013 --> 00:42:27,580
- There are other
jobs out there.

807
00:42:28,282 --> 00:42:29,682
We'll figure something out.

808
00:42:30,751 --> 00:42:32,052
Until such times,

809
00:42:33,054 --> 00:42:35,020
let daddy take care of you.

810
00:42:35,022 --> 00:42:36,524
- Oh, Daddy.

811
00:42:42,430 --> 00:42:44,830
Not gonna worry about it today.

812
00:42:44,832 --> 00:42:45,898
- Okay.
- Today is fun.

813
00:42:45,900 --> 00:42:47,266
- Okay.

814
00:42:47,268 --> 00:42:47,534
- I'll worry about
the rest tomorrow.

815
00:42:47,536 --> 00:42:49,069
- Okay.

816
00:42:50,371 --> 00:42:52,005
- Was there something
you wanted to tell me?

817
00:42:54,608 --> 00:42:57,010
- I was gonna ask you, had
you considered photography?

818
00:42:58,012 --> 00:42:59,178
- Eh.

819
00:42:59,180 --> 00:43:00,479
I take pictures for fun.

820
00:43:00,481 --> 00:43:02,347
- Uh-uh.

821
00:43:02,349 --> 00:43:04,050
You really have a great eye.

822
00:43:06,220 --> 00:43:07,719
Can't nobody capture
a moment like you.

823
00:43:07,721 --> 00:43:09,021
- Mmm.

824
00:43:09,023 --> 00:43:11,323
Memories and moments.

825
00:43:49,296 --> 00:43:51,197
- Wanna hit this?

826
00:44:27,536 --> 00:44:28,400
- I didn't say come in.

827
00:44:28,402 --> 00:44:29,836
- I know, I'm sorry.

828
00:44:31,472 --> 00:44:32,672
I got oatmeal.

829
00:44:34,175 --> 00:44:36,209
The gas is back on, good news.

830
00:44:37,612 --> 00:44:40,045
So I was able to
boil some water.

831
00:44:40,047 --> 00:44:41,980
There's some rice and beans
in there, if you'd like that.

832
00:44:41,982 --> 00:44:44,316
- I'm not hungry.

833
00:44:44,318 --> 00:44:46,352
- I heard your
stomach from out there.

834
00:44:51,358 --> 00:44:53,392
- What kind is it?

835
00:44:53,394 --> 00:44:54,827
- Peaches and cream.

836
00:44:56,430 --> 00:44:57,864
- Thanks.

837
00:45:02,069 --> 00:45:04,836
- Can we maybe
pretend to be friends?

838
00:45:04,838 --> 00:45:06,739
- I don't wanna play this game.

839
00:45:07,741 --> 00:45:08,807
- Would you play something else?

840
00:45:08,809 --> 00:45:10,043
- Like what?

841
00:45:11,513 --> 00:45:12,879
- "The Vulnerable Truth".

842
00:45:14,481 --> 00:45:16,015
- Sounds boring.

843
00:45:17,718 --> 00:45:18,618
- I thought of
different questions.

844
00:45:18,620 --> 00:45:20,886
Some we may know the answer to,

845
00:45:20,888 --> 00:45:22,722
some we may not.

846
00:45:23,757 --> 00:45:25,758
But I figured we'd pull them

847
00:45:26,827 --> 00:45:28,995
in hopes of getting
to an honest answer.

848
00:45:31,065 --> 00:45:32,765
- I think we've had
enough honesty for one day.

849
00:45:35,336 --> 00:45:36,869
- Okay.

850
00:45:39,974 --> 00:45:41,773
- This was
not an act of terror

851
00:45:41,775 --> 00:45:44,510
but a group of transformers
that exploded in the subway

852
00:45:44,512 --> 00:45:47,547
causing a chain reaction
and massive blast.

853
00:45:47,549 --> 00:45:49,248
It's going to be some
time before authorities

854
00:45:49,250 --> 00:45:50,849
are able to remedy the situation

855
00:45:50,851 --> 00:45:53,318
and restore power
across the city.

856
00:45:53,320 --> 00:45:56,021
Cell service for some
carriers had been restored.

857
00:45:56,023 --> 00:45:59,024
Police are confirming--

858
00:45:59,026 --> 00:45:59,958
- Of criminal
activities across the city.

859
00:45:59,960 --> 00:46:02,695
The lockdown is still in effect.

860
00:46:02,697 --> 00:46:05,965
Stay inside and stay alive.

861
00:46:10,471 --> 00:46:11,938
- I finally did it.

862
00:46:17,011 --> 00:46:18,778
I had oatmeal.

863
00:46:21,583 --> 00:46:23,116
- It was gooey but good.

864
00:46:24,619 --> 00:46:26,653
- Told you oatmeal's the bomb.

865
00:46:26,655 --> 00:46:28,521
- I know,

866
00:46:28,523 --> 00:46:30,423
I should have listened, I know.

867
00:46:38,932 --> 00:46:40,633
- I'll play your
stupid game with you...

868
00:46:40,635 --> 00:46:43,803
after I shower.

869
00:46:48,409 --> 00:46:50,176
- Thanks for trying.

870
00:47:59,614 --> 00:48:01,079
- Don't say anything.

871
00:48:01,081 --> 00:48:02,915
- Hi, Amari.

872
00:48:04,552 --> 00:48:05,918
Long time no see.

873
00:48:07,388 --> 00:48:08,453
- Hush.

874
00:48:09,557 --> 00:48:10,923
- I'm serious.

875
00:48:11,392 --> 00:48:13,025
You look so...

876
00:48:13,528 --> 00:48:14,961
handsome.

877
00:48:15,764 --> 00:48:17,196
- Thanks.

878
00:48:18,365 --> 00:48:20,733
All right, so how do
we play this game?

879
00:48:20,735 --> 00:48:24,605
- You just have to pull some
questions out of the candle.

880
00:48:29,677 --> 00:48:31,944
- "What are you most afraid of?"

881
00:48:33,782 --> 00:48:35,148
- Losing you.

882
00:48:39,253 --> 00:48:40,419
- Honestly, I don't
think that part

883
00:48:40,421 --> 00:48:42,121
of our relationship
can be saved.

884
00:48:43,591 --> 00:48:45,625
- Can we try counseling?

885
00:48:45,627 --> 00:48:47,827
Would you be open to it?

886
00:48:47,829 --> 00:48:48,861
- We're
playing your game,

887
00:48:48,863 --> 00:48:51,364
questions only from the candle.

888
00:49:08,382 --> 00:49:11,451
- "If you can change one thing
about me, what would it be?"

889
00:49:13,888 --> 00:49:15,588
- Your breath be stank.

890
00:49:17,625 --> 00:49:18,791
- I talk a lot.

891
00:49:18,793 --> 00:49:20,626
- That is no excuse.

892
00:49:20,628 --> 00:49:24,196
Have a mint handy,
some gum, something.

893
00:49:24,198 --> 00:49:25,230
Don't no one want hot
air in their face.

894
00:49:25,232 --> 00:49:27,800
- Why didn't you tell me before?

895
00:49:27,802 --> 00:49:30,101
- I just noticed it.

896
00:49:30,103 --> 00:49:30,770
And I didn't wanna
hurt your feelings.

897
00:49:30,772 --> 00:49:31,804
- I'm not fragile.

898
00:49:31,806 --> 00:49:34,439
- Mmm.

899
00:49:34,441 --> 00:49:34,874
Okay, well then maybe you
should go get that checked out.

900
00:49:34,876 --> 00:49:36,475
Hope it's not halitosis

901
00:49:36,477 --> 00:49:38,010
- Gross.

902
00:49:39,313 --> 00:49:42,482
I hope not.

903
00:49:44,318 --> 00:49:46,152
- These are dumb questions.

904
00:49:47,187 --> 00:49:49,121
"What's your favorite
thing about me?"

905
00:49:51,458 --> 00:49:52,992
- Well,

906
00:49:54,529 --> 00:49:56,262
I love how you're able to
see things in pictures.

907
00:49:58,600 --> 00:50:02,368
How you're able to capture
the perfect moment.

908
00:50:04,739 --> 00:50:06,272
- Memories are moments.

909
00:50:06,941 --> 00:50:08,474
Thanks.

910
00:50:09,076 --> 00:50:11,143
- Speaking of,

911
00:50:12,847 --> 00:50:14,680
may I present you with a gift?

912
00:50:14,682 --> 00:50:15,548
- Uh-uh.

913
00:50:15,550 --> 00:50:16,682
No.

914
00:50:16,684 --> 00:50:18,117
- It's from Nana and I.

915
00:50:19,419 --> 00:50:21,019
- I see what you're
trying to do.

916
00:50:26,828 --> 00:50:28,393
- We thought you could
use some inspiration.

917
00:50:28,395 --> 00:50:30,296
Get the creative juices flowing.

918
00:50:41,509 --> 00:50:44,911
- Oh,

919
00:50:51,051 --> 00:50:52,553
Oh.

920
00:50:57,224 --> 00:50:59,258
Everybody's a
photographer these days.

921
00:51:00,528 --> 00:51:02,695
- People can snap a
picture for the gram

922
00:51:02,697 --> 00:51:06,131
but not everyone can
capture a moment, a memory,

923
00:51:06,133 --> 00:51:07,601
that lasts a lifetime.

924
00:51:09,003 --> 00:51:10,637
- Wow, this...

925
00:51:13,908 --> 00:51:15,441
This is really awesome.

926
00:51:16,678 --> 00:51:18,109
Take it for a spin.

927
00:51:18,111 --> 00:51:19,979
- Oh.

928
00:51:19,981 --> 00:51:22,113
There's so many buttons.

929
00:51:22,115 --> 00:51:24,416
Ah, oh, I don't even know what
I'm doing with this thing.

930
00:51:24,418 --> 00:51:26,786
- You'll figure it out.

931
00:51:26,788 --> 00:51:28,321
Practice makes progress.

932
00:51:37,732 --> 00:51:39,231
- Mmm.

933
00:51:44,872 --> 00:51:46,204
This is too much.

934
00:51:46,206 --> 00:51:48,307
- Don't worry about it.

935
00:51:49,276 --> 00:51:51,242
- Nana is on disability, Q.

936
00:51:51,244 --> 00:51:52,344
She shouldn't even
be sending me money.

937
00:51:52,346 --> 00:51:54,447
- It's a gift.

938
00:51:54,882 --> 00:51:56,382
Accept it.

939
00:52:01,488 --> 00:52:04,323
May I at least model for you?

940
00:52:10,031 --> 00:52:12,264
- Go stand over there.

941
00:52:13,701 --> 00:52:15,234
Go.

942
00:52:19,239 --> 00:52:21,273
Now,

943
00:52:21,441 --> 00:52:23,275
look away from me.

944
00:52:23,845 --> 00:52:25,845
Mmm.

945
00:52:26,246 --> 00:52:28,047
Yes.

946
00:52:30,217 --> 00:52:31,852
Okay, now turn towards me

947
00:52:32,920 --> 00:52:34,721
and just touch your...

948
00:52:35,222 --> 00:52:36,857
You know what?

949
00:52:40,193 --> 00:52:41,728
Hmm?

950
00:52:41,963 --> 00:52:42,795
Oh.

951
00:52:42,797 --> 00:52:44,330
Yeah

952
00:52:45,133 --> 00:52:47,332
Look up at me.

953
00:52:47,334 --> 00:52:49,568
Yes.

954
00:52:49,570 --> 00:52:52,371
Now give me one with a smile.

955
00:52:53,941 --> 00:52:55,709
- Even though my breath stank?

956
00:52:59,047 --> 00:53:00,445
- Remember when I used
to tell you corny jokes

957
00:53:00,447 --> 00:53:02,314
just to make you laugh?

958
00:53:02,449 --> 00:53:04,282
- I remember.

959
00:53:04,284 --> 00:53:05,919
- What do you call

960
00:53:07,955 --> 00:53:10,524
a pig that does karate?

961
00:53:11,092 --> 00:53:12,457
- A pork chop.

962
00:53:15,596 --> 00:53:17,997
How about, why shouldn't
you write with a broken pen?

963
00:53:17,999 --> 00:53:19,899
- Because...

964
00:53:19,901 --> 00:53:21,535
it's pointless.

965
00:53:33,781 --> 00:53:35,716
- Those are good.

966
00:53:36,851 --> 00:53:38,416
You're a professional.

967
00:53:38,418 --> 00:53:40,386
- Thanks.

968
00:53:45,126 --> 00:53:46,560
- Can we pass?

969
00:53:47,195 --> 00:53:48,929
- Your game, your rules.

970
00:53:57,004 --> 00:53:59,740
- What do you love about me?

971
00:54:00,440 --> 00:54:01,942
- I love...

972
00:54:05,179 --> 00:54:07,413
how dedicated you are.

973
00:54:10,618 --> 00:54:12,986
When you put your mind to
something, you can do anything

974
00:54:14,488 --> 00:54:16,455
to get your mission
accomplished.

975
00:54:18,126 --> 00:54:20,258
I think the reason we
work so well is because

976
00:54:20,260 --> 00:54:21,927
I have great ideas...

977
00:54:21,929 --> 00:54:23,361
and...

978
00:54:23,363 --> 00:54:25,031
you...

979
00:54:25,967 --> 00:54:27,934
are a great executor.

980
00:54:34,108 --> 00:54:36,610
- Is there anything
I can do to fix this?

981
00:54:36,944 --> 00:54:38,544
Tell me.

982
00:54:38,546 --> 00:54:40,146
You know I will do it.

983
00:54:40,148 --> 00:54:41,581
- I know.

984
00:54:43,885 --> 00:54:46,019
But I don't think we're
something that can be fixed.

985
00:54:52,693 --> 00:54:54,126
- I remember the
first time we met.

986
00:54:56,898 --> 00:54:59,965
- I was working at that
boutique hotel in Harlem.

987
00:54:59,967 --> 00:55:03,636
And you were sitting
at the bar on a date

988
00:55:03,638 --> 00:55:05,070
with some other dude.

989
00:55:05,072 --> 00:55:06,371
I should have known then.

990
00:55:06,373 --> 00:55:08,340
- I was not on a date.

991
00:55:10,978 --> 00:55:12,945
We were out having drinks
and he was a lawyer

992
00:55:12,947 --> 00:55:15,514
and not even my type.

993
00:55:15,516 --> 00:55:17,448
- I asked you if you
wanted another round.

994
00:55:17,450 --> 00:55:19,718
- And you brought
me the wrong drink.

995
00:55:19,720 --> 00:55:21,253
- I didn't charge you.

996
00:55:23,057 --> 00:55:25,490
- I wrote my number on
the back of that receipt

997
00:55:25,492 --> 00:55:27,093
and told you to
text me, you did.

998
00:55:28,863 --> 00:55:31,363
And the next night we
went for Cuban food.

999
00:55:33,868 --> 00:55:36,702
We've been chained
together ever since.

1000
00:55:36,704 --> 00:55:38,404
- "Chained" is a
good word for it.

1001
00:55:39,472 --> 00:55:40,874
- It wasn't all bad.

1002
00:55:50,651 --> 00:55:52,351
- I wanna remember
the good stuff.

1003
00:55:54,622 --> 00:55:56,889
I'm sorry you went through
all that by yourself.

1004
00:55:56,891 --> 00:55:58,892
- I'm sorry I didn't tell you.

1005
00:56:01,629 --> 00:56:03,864
I hadn't told anybody.

1006
00:56:05,967 --> 00:56:07,900
- It's nothing
to be ashamed of.

1007
00:56:07,902 --> 00:56:09,135
- I'm not.

1008
00:56:11,371 --> 00:56:12,772
Not anymore.

1009
00:56:20,548 --> 00:56:21,948
Final pull?

1010
00:56:25,253 --> 00:56:27,786
- "If you could be any place
in the world right now,

1011
00:56:27,788 --> 00:56:29,388
"where would you be?"

1012
00:56:31,826 --> 00:56:33,126
- I...

1013
00:56:35,428 --> 00:56:37,463
I wouldn't be any
place but here...

1014
00:56:38,165 --> 00:56:39,431
with you,

1015
00:56:40,902 --> 00:56:42,102
my best friend.

1016
00:56:46,574 --> 00:56:48,274
- I think we're gonna
have to take some time

1017
00:56:48,276 --> 00:56:50,442
before we can be friends.

1018
00:56:51,212 --> 00:56:53,713
If we can be friends.

1019
00:56:56,416 --> 00:56:58,151
- I understand.

1020
00:56:59,820 --> 00:57:01,420
I just want us to be something.

1021
00:57:03,456 --> 00:57:04,891
- Me too.

1022
00:57:17,905 --> 00:57:19,839
- Is there anything you've been

1023
00:57:21,575 --> 00:57:23,409
not completely honest about,

1024
00:57:23,411 --> 00:57:26,378
like a secret online
dating profile,

1025
00:57:26,380 --> 00:57:28,548
late night bathroom hookups?

1026
00:57:31,018 --> 00:57:32,185
- There...

1027
00:57:35,289 --> 00:57:37,556
There is something that
I haven't told you.

1028
00:57:37,558 --> 00:57:38,624
- You hypocrite.

1029
00:57:38,626 --> 00:57:40,927
- It was not sexual but...

1030
00:57:41,395 --> 00:57:43,830
I have withheld information.

1031
00:57:44,665 --> 00:57:47,466
- Withholding is lying.

1032
00:57:48,903 --> 00:57:50,502
- So...

1033
00:57:54,308 --> 00:57:56,342
when I went to the doctor to see

1034
00:57:56,344 --> 00:57:58,611
if there was anything
wrong with me mentally,

1035
00:58:02,016 --> 00:58:03,850
they did a full
of physical and...

1036
00:58:08,389 --> 00:58:10,789
found some abnormal cells.

1037
00:58:10,791 --> 00:58:13,025
- Abnormal cells, do we need
to get a second opinion?

1038
00:58:13,027 --> 00:58:15,694
- It turned to be
nothing, that's...

1039
00:58:15,696 --> 00:58:18,964
They're gonna monitor
it over time, I'm fine.

1040
00:58:18,966 --> 00:58:22,936
But it could
potentially become...

1041
00:58:24,472 --> 00:58:26,372
prostate cancer.

1042
00:58:26,374 --> 00:58:27,740
- Amari!
- I didn't say anything

1043
00:58:27,742 --> 00:58:29,208
because I didn't want
you to overreact.

1044
00:58:29,210 --> 00:58:31,277
Like I said, potentially,

1045
00:58:31,712 --> 00:58:33,546
and I'm fine.

1046
00:58:36,784 --> 00:58:38,585
So three months ago.

1047
00:58:40,388 --> 00:58:42,655
- Is that why you've been
avoiding having sex with me?

1048
00:58:44,692 --> 00:58:46,526
- The doctor said that...

1049
00:58:49,130 --> 00:58:53,533
anal sex doesn't
make the cells grow

1050
00:58:53,968 --> 00:58:55,635
but...

1051
00:58:58,806 --> 00:59:00,640
I can't stop thinking about it.

1052
00:59:11,652 --> 00:59:13,753
- I guess we do have to
try something different.

1053
00:59:25,066 --> 00:59:26,800
- Are you open?

1054
00:59:32,740 --> 00:59:34,774
- Always open for you.

1055
01:00:02,503 --> 01:00:03,870
- We could have...

1056
01:00:05,239 --> 01:00:07,173
discussed...

1057
01:00:08,409 --> 01:00:10,176
your needs to explore.

1058
01:00:10,811 --> 01:00:12,045
- I wasn't exploring.

1059
01:00:14,448 --> 01:00:16,382
I didn't even wanna
go on that damn trip.

1060
01:00:17,952 --> 01:00:19,084
- I thought getting away
was gonna be good for you.

1061
01:00:19,086 --> 01:00:20,286
- It wasn't.

1062
01:00:23,424 --> 01:00:25,658
It felt like my Nana's
death meant nothing to you.

1063
01:00:26,627 --> 01:00:29,395
- That was never my intention.

1064
01:00:30,898 --> 01:00:33,700
- I never got to be
completely honest about me.

1065
01:00:34,702 --> 01:00:36,136
About us.

1066
01:00:42,309 --> 01:00:45,645
- Amari could sound
like a girl's name.

1067
01:00:48,749 --> 01:00:50,717
- She stopped asking about you

1068
01:00:53,988 --> 01:00:56,288
after I kept on making
up so many excuses

1069
01:00:56,290 --> 01:00:58,191
why you could never
make it to Houston.

1070
01:01:00,529 --> 01:01:02,328
- She loved you...

1071
01:01:03,130 --> 01:01:04,764
regardless.

1072
01:01:05,166 --> 01:01:06,766
- Yeah.

1073
01:01:08,269 --> 01:01:09,802
Hope so.

1074
01:01:13,974 --> 01:01:16,409
Just wanted to make
her proud, you know?

1075
01:01:18,245 --> 01:01:20,847
- Q, look at all the things
that you accomplished.

1076
01:01:22,651 --> 01:01:24,951
She was very proud of you.

1077
01:01:42,136 --> 01:01:45,304
- Have the apartment
for a few months.

1078
01:01:45,306 --> 01:01:46,839
I'll go stay with Glenn.

1079
01:01:48,742 --> 01:01:50,243
- No.

1080
01:01:51,979 --> 01:01:55,448
I'm gonna go back to
Chicago for a little while.

1081
01:01:57,151 --> 01:01:58,885
Spend some time with Nana.

1082
01:02:00,721 --> 01:02:02,822
- She's too much.

1083
01:02:03,592 --> 01:02:05,457
Can't believe she made a comment

1084
01:02:05,459 --> 01:02:07,125
that we should be
making home videos

1085
01:02:07,127 --> 01:02:09,028
when she realized the
camera shot videos.

1086
01:02:10,665 --> 01:02:12,065
- Yeah, she's crazy.

1087
01:02:15,936 --> 01:02:17,337
But I love her.

1088
01:02:23,077 --> 01:02:25,011
- That's what
connected us instantly.

1089
01:02:27,915 --> 01:02:29,816
The fact we were both
raised by our grandma.

1090
01:02:33,787 --> 01:02:35,421
- Yeah, Nana's Boys.

1091
01:02:47,334 --> 01:02:49,135
- What are we supposed
to tell our friends?

1092
01:02:49,638 --> 01:02:51,104
- Tell your friends...

1093
01:02:54,808 --> 01:02:56,576
whatever you feel
comfortable sharing.

1094
01:02:56,578 --> 01:02:57,844
- I let you down.

1095
01:02:58,546 --> 01:02:59,911
- Q, that's the thing,

1096
01:02:59,913 --> 01:03:03,215
you try so hard to
be liked by everybody

1097
01:03:03,217 --> 01:03:05,551
and have everything
go according to plan.

1098
01:03:05,553 --> 01:03:07,186
If we learned anything today,

1099
01:03:08,590 --> 01:03:11,157
it's that life is lived
through instant moments,

1100
01:03:12,092 --> 01:03:13,860
not prolonged plans.

1101
01:03:17,599 --> 01:03:19,532
Thank you for the camera.

1102
01:03:19,534 --> 01:03:20,900
- You're welcome.

1103
01:03:25,306 --> 01:03:26,972
It just...

1104
01:03:26,974 --> 01:03:28,509
can't wait...

1105
01:03:32,046 --> 01:03:35,948
and expect life to happen
in the snap of a moment.

1106
01:03:37,619 --> 01:03:39,152
You do need a plan.

1107
01:03:41,388 --> 01:03:43,221
- You're right.

1108
01:03:43,223 --> 01:03:45,123
- Trust in something
greater than yourself.

1109
01:03:45,125 --> 01:03:46,959
- Okay, you don't
have to preach to me.

1110
01:03:48,563 --> 01:03:50,829
- Why are you so resistant
anytime I bring up the Creator?

1111
01:03:50,831 --> 01:03:52,164
- Because I don't
have the energy

1112
01:03:52,166 --> 01:03:55,536
to have faith in the
idea of something.

1113
01:03:56,970 --> 01:03:59,138
- Faith is confidence
in yourself

1114
01:04:00,908 --> 01:04:03,109
and your abilities,
your intuition.

1115
01:04:09,249 --> 01:04:12,519
- And what was your
faith in us in Mexico?

1116
01:04:17,625 --> 01:04:19,192
I thought so.

1117
01:04:24,131 --> 01:04:26,498
- You gotta believe in
something bigger than you.

1118
01:04:26,500 --> 01:04:27,934
Something.

1119
01:04:28,603 --> 01:04:29,968
You always get defensive

1120
01:04:29,970 --> 01:04:33,005
whenever I question
you about anything.

1121
01:04:34,609 --> 01:04:35,474
- Q, if I walked outside that
door right now and got mugged,

1122
01:04:35,476 --> 01:04:36,843
is that God?

1123
01:04:36,845 --> 01:04:38,745
- No, that's man.

1124
01:04:38,747 --> 01:04:43,215
He's attached to chains of lack.

1125
01:04:43,217 --> 01:04:45,283
That's why there's systems
of oppression at place.

1126
01:04:45,285 --> 01:04:47,319
- Q, you are part of
two of the biggest

1127
01:04:47,321 --> 01:04:50,056
systems of oppression that
exist, marriage and laws.

1128
01:04:51,425 --> 01:04:54,359
- I like the passion but
tell me more of the argument.

1129
01:04:54,361 --> 01:04:56,996
- Q, you can't force your
ideas of this subject on me.

1130
01:04:58,800 --> 01:05:00,332
- You know the difference
between religion
and spiritually?

1131
01:05:00,334 --> 01:05:03,034
- No, but I got a feeling
you're gonna tell me.

1132
01:05:03,036 --> 01:05:05,203
- Would you be
open to meditating?

1133
01:05:05,205 --> 01:05:06,973
- I don't even know
where to start.

1134
01:05:07,441 --> 01:05:08,642
- I'll show you.

1135
01:05:18,051 --> 01:05:20,152
- What you doing?

1136
01:05:20,154 --> 01:05:23,288
- Just cleaning out the space,

1137
01:05:23,290 --> 01:05:25,858
inviting new possibilities.

1138
01:05:27,629 --> 01:05:29,061
- I can't.

1139
01:05:29,997 --> 01:05:32,031
This is too woo-woo for me.

1140
01:05:32,667 --> 01:05:34,434
- Sit down.

1141
01:05:36,336 --> 01:05:39,439
Embrace the fact that
change is the only constant.

1142
01:05:41,942 --> 01:05:44,277
It might be scary
or painful but...

1143
01:05:46,548 --> 01:05:47,714
we have to...

1144
01:05:48,650 --> 01:05:50,016
go through it.

1145
01:05:53,621 --> 01:05:55,154
- All right.

1146
01:05:58,492 --> 01:06:00,058
So,

1147
01:06:00,060 --> 01:06:02,328
be open to whatever
thoughts come up.

1148
01:06:06,166 --> 01:06:08,267
Just observe and release
them as they come.

1149
01:06:15,810 --> 01:06:17,343
- Okay.

1150
01:06:19,514 --> 01:06:21,113
- I wanna start by
sitting in silence.

1151
01:06:21,850 --> 01:06:23,216
Five minutes.

1152
01:06:29,122 --> 01:06:31,090
I hope my breath don't stink.

1153
01:06:32,794 --> 01:06:33,893
- I don't smell anything.

1154
01:06:33,895 --> 01:06:35,428
- Good.

1155
01:06:36,865 --> 01:06:38,297
All right.

1156
01:06:41,168 --> 01:06:45,171
- Breath is the most
important thing.

1157
01:06:46,106 --> 01:06:48,941
It's all the
evidence that we need

1158
01:06:48,943 --> 01:06:52,178
to know that we matter...

1159
01:06:57,017 --> 01:06:58,384
that we're alive.

1160
01:07:00,755 --> 01:07:02,121
- This is pretty easy.

1161
01:07:03,390 --> 01:07:05,291
Maybe you should be
a woo-woo instructor.

1162
01:07:05,860 --> 01:07:07,360
- Maybe.

1163
01:07:12,032 --> 01:07:14,100
- Okay, what's next?

1164
01:07:16,036 --> 01:07:17,470
- Just...

1165
01:07:17,772 --> 01:07:19,305
sit.

1166
01:07:22,342 --> 01:07:25,645
The goal is to quiet the
mind so that we can hear our

1167
01:07:25,647 --> 01:07:28,615
intuition, connect
to the heart center.

1168
01:07:33,120 --> 01:07:34,588
Whenever you're ready,

1169
01:07:36,156 --> 01:07:39,258
wiggle your fingers
and your toes.

1170
01:07:39,961 --> 01:07:42,228
Bring life back into the body.

1171
01:07:44,298 --> 01:07:46,232
Flutter your eyes open.

1172
01:07:53,608 --> 01:07:56,976
I've been saving this
for a special occasion.

1173
01:07:56,978 --> 01:07:58,712
Red, black or blue?

1174
01:07:59,547 --> 01:08:01,213
- Red.

1175
01:08:11,993 --> 01:08:14,293
- Write your heart out.

1176
01:08:19,734 --> 01:08:21,300
Happy birthday.

1177
01:08:21,736 --> 01:08:23,269
- Thank you.

1178
01:08:42,557 --> 01:08:44,122
- Oh, can you hand me the
rice and beans, please?

1179
01:08:44,124 --> 01:08:45,659
- Yeah.

1180
01:08:47,729 --> 01:08:48,961
You know, you really
do make the best rice.

1181
01:08:48,963 --> 01:08:50,463
- Nana taught me well.

1182
01:08:58,906 --> 01:09:02,074
- I'd hate to lose
her too, you know.

1183
01:09:02,076 --> 01:09:03,509
- You know, separating from me

1184
01:09:03,511 --> 01:09:06,311
doesn't me you
separate from her.

1185
01:09:06,313 --> 01:09:07,614
She has to make
her own decisions.

1186
01:09:13,755 --> 01:09:14,620
Don't.

1187
01:09:14,622 --> 01:09:17,123
- What?

1188
01:09:17,125 --> 01:09:18,423
- What are you doing?

1189
01:09:18,425 --> 01:09:20,458
- Gotta learn sometime.

1190
01:09:20,460 --> 01:09:21,727
- Trying to
steal my recipes.

1191
01:09:21,729 --> 01:09:22,928
- Recipe.

1192
01:09:22,930 --> 01:09:24,531
You only have one.

1193
01:09:26,834 --> 01:09:27,967
- You wanna know
how to make rice?

1194
01:09:27,969 --> 01:09:29,402
- Mm-hmm.

1195
01:09:29,837 --> 01:09:31,404
- The trick is,

1196
01:09:32,507 --> 01:09:35,441
put the seasons in first
before you add the race.

1197
01:09:37,011 --> 01:09:38,077
Go ahead, open that.

1198
01:09:38,079 --> 01:09:40,379
I'll get it started.

1199
01:10:08,576 --> 01:10:10,944
I really had fun tonight.

1200
01:10:12,446 --> 01:10:14,346
You been practicing that song.

1201
01:10:17,250 --> 01:10:19,385
- I had big plans for that song.

1202
01:10:21,421 --> 01:10:23,022
Oh, look at God!

1203
01:10:23,024 --> 01:10:24,690
Oh.

1204
01:10:24,692 --> 01:10:27,026
- Oh.
- I'm sorry, babe.

1205
01:10:27,028 --> 01:10:29,730
- Well, He did say,
"Let there be light."

1206
01:10:37,939 --> 01:10:39,405
Good night.

1207
01:10:43,443 --> 01:10:44,978
- Good night.

1208
01:12:27,815 --> 01:12:29,415
- Hey.

1209
01:12:30,184 --> 01:12:32,051
- Hey.

1210
01:12:32,053 --> 01:12:33,319
- What time is it?

1211
01:12:33,321 --> 01:12:35,221
- 6:30.

1212
01:12:35,223 --> 01:12:36,422
- Ooh, it's early.

1213
01:12:40,995 --> 01:12:42,394
You don't have to go.

1214
01:12:43,430 --> 01:12:45,397
I can sublease a spot

1215
01:12:47,235 --> 01:12:49,636
and take care of the bills here
until you get on your feet.

1216
01:12:51,005 --> 01:12:52,939
- Luckily, this is not a
divorce you have to settle, Q.

1217
01:12:57,111 --> 01:12:59,178
- Keep that for emergencies.

1218
01:12:59,180 --> 01:13:00,847
- I don't need it.

1219
01:13:04,785 --> 01:13:06,585
- Can I give you one more gift?

1220
01:13:06,587 --> 01:13:08,821
- It's not my birthday anymore.

1221
01:13:08,823 --> 01:13:11,891
You were born at 5:49 on
the 29th of September,

1222
01:13:11,893 --> 01:13:14,226
so technically it
is your birthday,

1223
01:13:14,228 --> 01:13:15,729
if we're being technical.

1224
01:13:22,402 --> 01:13:23,970
- Thank you, ooh.

1225
01:13:28,542 --> 01:13:29,943
Morning breath.

1226
01:13:31,379 --> 01:13:32,712
You should work on that.

1227
01:13:33,748 --> 01:13:35,081
Now.

1228
01:13:46,694 --> 01:13:48,962
- Remember that surprise
getaway I had planned for us?

1229
01:13:51,098 --> 01:13:52,464
You should go.

1230
01:13:55,236 --> 01:13:58,671
A car has been arranged
to depart from here

1231
01:13:58,673 --> 01:14:01,173
to take you to an all-inclusive,
adults only resort

1232
01:14:01,175 --> 01:14:03,509
in Martha's Vineyard.

1233
01:14:03,511 --> 01:14:05,477
Everything has
already been paid for.

1234
01:14:06,914 --> 01:14:08,915
And I would really hate
to lose that money.

1235
01:14:10,217 --> 01:14:11,584
Please.

1236
01:14:12,653 --> 01:14:15,121
I know it's one of your
dream places to visit.

1237
01:14:16,624 --> 01:14:18,525
- It's really hard
to say no to you, Q.

1238
01:14:19,860 --> 01:14:20,659
- Happy birthday.

1239
01:14:20,661 --> 01:14:22,493
- Thank you.

1240
01:14:22,495 --> 01:14:23,997
Can I open this later?

1241
01:14:24,598 --> 01:14:26,032
- Yeah, it's cool.

1242
01:14:36,043 --> 01:14:37,243
- Thank you.

1243
01:14:38,512 --> 01:14:39,946
Seriously.

1244
01:14:43,117 --> 01:14:45,885
- This no contact,
no following thing.

1245
01:14:47,655 --> 01:14:49,589
How will I know when
it's time to reconnect?

1246
01:14:53,260 --> 01:14:54,661
- I'll reach out to you.

1247
01:15:04,672 --> 01:15:06,605
- You sure you got
everything you need?

1248
01:15:06,607 --> 01:15:08,307
Small bag.

1249
01:15:08,309 --> 01:15:10,043
- Got everything I need.

1250
01:15:13,247 --> 01:15:15,048
- I never thought it
would end like this.

1251
01:15:19,353 --> 01:15:22,188
- Endings just happen,

1252
01:15:23,724 --> 01:15:27,494
but they happen so there
can be a new beginning.

1253
01:15:31,365 --> 01:15:33,133
Please make this easier on us.

1254
01:15:34,468 --> 01:15:35,702
- Keep this.

1255
01:15:39,874 --> 01:15:42,108
- I am going to go on this trip

1256
01:15:44,445 --> 01:15:46,079
and you are gonna pay for it.

1257
01:15:49,316 --> 01:15:50,617
- Well that makes me happy.

1258
01:15:51,285 --> 01:15:52,652
- Isn't that what you want?

1259
01:16:06,801 --> 01:16:09,002
It's time to let go of me.

1260
01:16:11,238 --> 01:16:13,039
This idea of me,

1261
01:16:13,240 --> 01:16:14,674
the plan,

1262
01:16:16,677 --> 01:16:18,144
all of it.

1263
01:16:27,021 --> 01:16:28,354
- Amari?

1264
01:16:31,025 --> 01:16:32,725
- Q.

1265
01:16:37,264 --> 01:16:39,666
- Rock, paper, scissors?

1266
01:17:10,764 --> 01:17:12,231
- Hey, Nana.

1267
01:17:12,233 --> 01:17:13,765
I left you a voicemail.

1268
01:17:13,767 --> 01:17:15,734
Yes, we're good.

1269
01:17:17,271 --> 01:17:18,605
Guess what?

1270
01:17:18,607 --> 01:17:20,907
I am going to be home on Monday.

1271
01:17:22,109 --> 01:17:24,476
No, I'm coming by myself.

1272
01:17:24,478 --> 01:17:27,180
Well, he did but I said no.

1273
01:17:29,250 --> 01:17:30,749
Oh, is he?

1274
01:17:30,751 --> 01:17:32,152
Interesting.

1275
01:17:32,786 --> 01:17:33,819
Well, call me back.

1276
01:17:33,821 --> 01:17:35,221
I love you.
