1
00:01:33,693 --> 00:01:36,287
My name is Tom Van Allen...

2
00:01:36,863 --> 00:01:39,195
...or Danny Parker.

3
00:01:40,266 --> 00:01:43,463
I honestly don't know anymore.

4
00:01:44,871 --> 00:01:46,839
You can decide.

5
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:50,373
Yeah, maybe you can help me, friend.

6
00:01:51,010 --> 00:01:55,640
As you can see, I don't have
a hell of a lot of time left.

7
00:01:56,316 --> 00:01:59,114
You can decide who I am.

8
00:01:59,652 --> 00:02:01,847
Avenging angel.

9
00:02:02,055 --> 00:02:04,546
Judas Iscariot.

10
00:02:04,757 --> 00:02:06,884
Loving husband.

11
00:02:07,093 --> 00:02:09,561
Prodigal son.

12
00:02:09,762 --> 00:02:11,992
Prince of Denmark.

13
00:02:12,999 --> 00:02:16,958
All of these? None of these?

14
00:02:17,170 --> 00:02:19,502
You decide.

15
00:02:20,306 --> 00:02:22,206
Trumpet player.

16
00:02:22,408 --> 00:02:24,876
Speed freak.

17
00:02:25,478 --> 00:02:27,343
Speed.

18
00:02:28,148 --> 00:02:31,083
That's as good a place
to start as any.

19
00:02:31,251 --> 00:02:36,018
But first, a little background
on the mad world of the tweeker.

20
00:02:37,357 --> 00:02:42,385
Methedrine was first distilled by a
Japanese scientist before WWll.

21
00:02:42,562 --> 00:02:47,522
Hand it to the Japanese, they knew
a good thing when they saw it.

22
00:02:47,734 --> 00:02:52,603
This guy is so tweeked he thinks
he can survive this without a scratch.

23
00:02:54,174 --> 00:02:56,369
Maybe not.

24
00:02:56,743 --> 00:03:01,806
By some estimates, 2%of the Japanese
had a meth problem after the war.

25
00:03:02,015 --> 00:03:05,007
Factory workers, soldiers, pilots.

26
00:03:05,185 --> 00:03:08,780
That's why it took two bombs
to get them to surrender.

27
00:03:08,955 --> 00:03:13,255
A nuclear blast is just a minor
nuisance to a determined tweeker.

28
00:03:13,426 --> 00:03:16,361
In the '50s,
the housewives got ahold of it.

29
00:03:16,529 --> 00:03:18,827
Dexedrine, Benzedrine, Methedrine.

30
00:03:19,032 --> 00:03:22,024
Now, that's a classic
speed freak for you.

31
00:03:22,235 --> 00:03:24,396
Skinny and cleaning house.

32
00:03:24,604 --> 00:03:28,199
Her husband never knew
what hit him in the sack.

33
00:03:30,076 --> 00:03:34,877
It's rumored that one of our presidents
dabbled with energy shots.

34
00:03:35,048 --> 00:03:38,142
Imagine that, a slammer
in the White House.

35
00:03:38,318 --> 00:03:42,220
If it's true, I bet Khrushchev
never got a word in edgewise.

36
00:03:42,722 --> 00:03:47,455
By the late '60s, the government
cracked down and sent it underground.

37
00:03:47,627 --> 00:03:50,391
Bikers controlled the market
for a while.

38
00:03:50,597 --> 00:03:56,160
Now anyone with a chemistry kit and
the ingredients can cook it at home.

39
00:03:57,937 --> 00:04:00,667
Ever see a long-haired,
tattooed freak...

40
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:04,901
...buying up all the cold medicine
at 3 in the morning?

41
00:04:05,378 --> 00:04:09,747
Take it from me,
he doesn't have a cold.

42
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:12,111
He's a cook.

43
00:04:12,285 --> 00:04:16,881
In his kitchen, you'll find a grocery
list of unsavory ingredients.

44
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:21,789
Drain cleaner, hydrochloric acid,
match heads for red phosphorus...

45
00:04:21,995 --> 00:04:25,192
...ether and of course,
the cold medicine.

46
00:04:25,398 --> 00:04:29,858
That's for the ephedrine
soon to become Methedrine.

47
00:04:30,036 --> 00:04:32,300
This guy is a regular Julia Child.

48
00:04:32,472 --> 00:04:37,239
Problem is, even Julia screws up
the bouillabaisse from time to time.

49
00:05:16,616 --> 00:05:19,847
-It's not right.
-You think?

50
00:05:20,053 --> 00:05:22,351
Something's off.

51
00:05:24,657 --> 00:05:27,057
We can do better.

52
00:05:29,362 --> 00:05:32,297
This dude in my CMA meeting...

53
00:05:32,498 --> 00:05:34,864
...he fucked my sister.

54
00:05:35,068 --> 00:05:36,933
-Funny!
-That's fucked.

55
00:05:37,136 --> 00:05:41,766
He's a quantum physicist.
He's telling me about uncertainty.

56
00:05:41,941 --> 00:05:44,637
You never know what
a molecule is doing.

57
00:05:44,811 --> 00:05:48,474
When you look at it, it changes,
it reacts. Like people.

58
00:05:48,648 --> 00:05:52,516
You wouldn't know what I was doing
unless you were looking.

59
00:05:52,685 --> 00:05:55,381
You're so locked in,
I could choke you!

60
00:05:55,588 --> 00:05:59,285
So here's the deal.
We'll do an experiment. Look at me.

61
00:05:59,459 --> 00:06:02,257
Look away. Look back at me.

62
00:06:03,629 --> 00:06:06,063
So that's where I found myself.

63
00:06:06,265 --> 00:06:09,257
No, I should choose
my words more wisely.

64
00:06:09,469 --> 00:06:11,733
This is the world I sought out.

65
00:06:11,938 --> 00:06:15,305
The land of the perpetual night party.

66
00:06:15,508 --> 00:06:18,739
Day swallowing night
and night swallowing day.

67
00:06:18,945 --> 00:06:23,177
The crank compressing time
like some divine piston...

68
00:06:23,383 --> 00:06:27,649
...on its awesome downstroke.

69
00:06:28,821 --> 00:06:32,052
We've been at this for three days.

70
00:06:32,558 --> 00:06:35,049
Or is it four?

71
00:06:35,695 --> 00:06:38,960
Tweekers, lokers, slammers,
coming and going...

72
00:06:39,132 --> 00:06:42,397
...swearing eternal allegiance
for one another...

73
00:06:42,568 --> 00:06:46,527
...only to wake up realizing
you wouldn't cross the street...

74
00:06:46,706 --> 00:06:49,698
...to piss on them
if their head was on fire.

75
00:06:49,876 --> 00:06:51,707
Three days.

76
00:06:51,878 --> 00:06:54,745
Or is it four?

77
00:06:54,914 --> 00:06:58,907
I know what you're thinking
but don't give up on me yet.

78
00:06:59,352 --> 00:07:03,311
Just wait till I've told
my whole story.

79
00:07:05,625 --> 00:07:08,355
And keep your eyes open.

80
00:07:09,929 --> 00:07:11,453
Nothing is as it seems.

81
00:07:11,664 --> 00:07:14,292
-We're out of gak!
-What time is it?

82
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:17,663
-It's like 12.
-Midnight?

83
00:07:33,352 --> 00:07:36,082
-You okay?
-Yeah.

84
00:07:37,256 --> 00:07:40,589
I would not be into this without you.

85
00:07:40,793 --> 00:07:42,590
How did we get this gig?

86
00:07:42,795 --> 00:07:46,322
-I don't know. Got a dealer in mind?
-Bobby.

87
00:07:46,532 --> 00:07:49,330
-Who's Bobby?
-He'll have some good stuff.

88
00:07:49,535 --> 00:07:52,299
Jimmy the Finn,
let's score some gak.

89
00:07:58,177 --> 00:07:59,838
Bobby?

90
00:08:01,781 --> 00:08:03,942
They're coming.

91
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:05,378
What?

92
00:08:08,221 --> 00:08:10,314
The spiders, man.

93
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:17,156
But I'm ready for you this time!

94
00:08:18,698 --> 00:08:20,928
Ready for you!

95
00:08:31,177 --> 00:08:33,509
You thought you could fuck
with Bobby!

96
00:08:33,713 --> 00:08:36,580
You thought you could fuck
with Bobby!

97
00:08:36,782 --> 00:08:40,912
With Bobby
you thought you could fuck!

98
00:08:43,689 --> 00:08:47,489
Got that ass, boy! Yeah!

99
00:08:52,198 --> 00:08:56,567
-Who the fuck are you?
-It's me, man. It's Jimmy.

100
00:08:57,870 --> 00:09:01,738
-What can I do for you?
-Couple eight balls ought to do us.

101
00:09:02,808 --> 00:09:04,298
Six. Six.

102
00:09:04,510 --> 00:09:08,241
-I can't breathe!
-You know what? Don't mind her.

103
00:09:09,549 --> 00:09:12,382
Don't mind her, man!

104
00:09:12,585 --> 00:09:14,780
Shut the hell up, goddamn it!

105
00:09:14,987 --> 00:09:17,854
You know what?
I got no vocational skills.

106
00:09:18,057 --> 00:09:22,153
-What the fuck do you want from me?
-Hey, man, take it easy.

107
00:09:22,361 --> 00:09:27,594
-I got no vocational skills!
-Take it easy!

108
00:09:27,767 --> 00:09:30,702
-What?
-Lay off the girl!

109
00:09:30,903 --> 00:09:32,564
What?

110
00:09:34,674 --> 00:09:36,437
What?

111
00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:50,454
Did you bring the plastic men?

112
00:09:52,091 --> 00:09:55,083
Did you bring the plastic men?

113
00:09:57,797 --> 00:10:01,858
Did you bring the plastic men?

114
00:10:02,068 --> 00:10:04,127
No, man.

115
00:10:04,337 --> 00:10:07,670
That's your good crank
talking there, brother.

116
00:10:07,873 --> 00:10:11,468
Fucking come on, Bobby!
Come on!

117
00:10:12,011 --> 00:10:14,775
Bobby? Bobby?

118
00:10:14,981 --> 00:10:17,745
That rhymes with....

119
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:20,475
That rhymes with....

120
00:10:23,189 --> 00:10:25,282
Hobby.

121
00:10:25,491 --> 00:10:27,721
Hobby.

122
00:10:27,927 --> 00:10:30,293
-Hobby.
-Hobby.

123
00:10:33,899 --> 00:10:35,833
-I like that.
-Funny.

124
00:10:39,271 --> 00:10:42,172
Bobby, hobby.
Couple of eight balls, huh?

125
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:44,337
Six.

126
00:10:44,543 --> 00:10:47,239
I like that. Six.

127
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:49,511
Excuse me.

128
00:10:49,715 --> 00:10:53,412
I don't mean to impose
but I am the Ocean.

129
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:55,887
Thanks.

130
00:10:58,124 --> 00:11:02,754
What? He's just juiced.
He wouldn't do nothing.

131
00:11:06,165 --> 00:11:11,159
-It was like our own private soiree.
-So far in, we were out!

132
00:11:12,338 --> 00:11:15,398
How do you know
you're doing the right thing?

133
00:11:15,574 --> 00:11:19,670
I don't know, like people
around you are happy.

134
00:11:19,879 --> 00:11:22,677
They say thank you and stuff.

135
00:11:22,882 --> 00:11:25,715
Just go with the flow.

136
00:12:02,855 --> 00:12:06,313
Come on, brother, power chord!

137
00:12:38,991 --> 00:12:43,451
For the people that don't do drugs
or just do them occasionally...

138
00:12:43,662 --> 00:12:49,362
...it's something that becomes
your life and you belong.

139
00:12:50,169 --> 00:12:53,935
You finally hit bottom
and you know who you are...

140
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:57,166
...because you can't go any lower.

141
00:12:57,576 --> 00:12:59,771
When you find...

142
00:13:00,312 --> 00:13:02,507
...a friendship...

143
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:07,651
...that you wouldn't
have found anywhere else.

144
00:13:10,322 --> 00:13:12,813
Still and all...

145
00:13:12,992 --> 00:13:18,294
...there's a kind of intimacy
with those that can go the distance.

146
00:13:26,372 --> 00:13:32,607
Sometimes you see
the world so clearly...

147
00:13:33,746 --> 00:13:37,079
...and you know just what to do...

148
00:13:37,283 --> 00:13:40,218
...and just when to do it.

149
00:13:40,419 --> 00:13:45,049
Just what you should have done
and when you should have done it.

150
00:14:12,518 --> 00:14:15,885
L.A. Sheriff's Department.
May I direct your call?

151
00:14:16,055 --> 00:14:20,355
C.I. number DJ6T5KF55.

152
00:14:20,559 --> 00:14:24,495
-Who's your contact?
-Morgan and Garcetti.

153
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:30,762
-Hey.
-Yo. Got a hot one.

154
00:14:30,970 --> 00:14:33,200
You go, my little tweeker friend.

155
00:14:33,405 --> 00:14:37,535
I don't wanna have
this conversation in Crankville.

156
00:14:44,850 --> 00:14:45,976
This the guy?

157
00:14:46,185 --> 00:14:49,086
It speaks, yeah.

158
00:14:49,288 --> 00:14:51,916
-Bobby, hobby, lobby.
-What?

159
00:14:52,124 --> 00:14:53,318
Bobby Ocean.

160
00:14:53,492 --> 00:14:55,892
Cut to the chase.
What's he holding?

161
00:14:56,061 --> 00:15:00,191
He's a tweeker. Definitely
gets high on his own supply.

162
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:02,765
What the fuck is he holding?

163
00:15:02,968 --> 00:15:06,131
Definitely a dealer.

164
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:10,171
-I am the Ocean.
-Couple pounds, maybe more.

165
00:15:10,342 --> 00:15:12,139
Mossberg pump on the floor.

166
00:15:12,311 --> 00:15:16,270
Cheap-ass MAC-12, fully loaded,
safety off. And some knives.

167
00:15:16,448 --> 00:15:20,009
-Any company?
-Yeah, there's a Mrs. Ocean.

168
00:15:20,219 --> 00:15:24,121
Probably won't give you trouble,
but could be a black belt.

169
00:15:24,323 --> 00:15:26,518
She was occupied at the time.

170
00:15:26,725 --> 00:15:29,694
Nice job, dog.
Let's take him down.

171
00:15:29,895 --> 00:15:32,159
All right.

172
00:15:32,364 --> 00:15:35,197
-And there was a kid.
-A kid?

173
00:15:35,401 --> 00:15:38,928
-You sure?
-Yeah, I'm pretty sure.

174
00:15:39,138 --> 00:15:41,834
Goddamn, you are
one observant tweeker.

175
00:15:42,041 --> 00:15:45,238
Thank you.
Learned from the best.

176
00:15:45,444 --> 00:15:49,471
And he likes to use the spear gun too,
so do be careful.

177
00:15:49,682 --> 00:15:53,641
-I'm touched.
-Fuck you, I'm worried about the kid.

178
00:15:53,852 --> 00:15:56,286
Why didn't you do something?

179
00:15:56,488 --> 00:15:58,479
Want me to do your paperwork?

180
00:15:58,691 --> 00:16:00,921
Know why you didn't do anything?

181
00:16:01,126 --> 00:16:06,621
Because you're a cocksucking,
lowlife tweeker. Shithead!

182
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:12,402
I never noticed your eyes were hazel.

183
00:16:12,604 --> 00:16:15,232
This dude will do anything
to touch me.

184
00:16:15,407 --> 00:16:17,875
Take him to Chippendales
or something.

185
00:16:31,223 --> 00:16:33,748
Oh, my God. Bobby!

186
00:16:35,828 --> 00:16:41,164
Why are you leaving me?
Bobby? Why?

187
00:18:08,887 --> 00:18:11,287
You need some help?

188
00:18:19,098 --> 00:18:23,501
I was living next to Miss Congeniality
and didn't even know it.

189
00:18:23,702 --> 00:18:25,033
Hey.

190
00:18:29,108 --> 00:18:33,010
You left some Chinese-Iooking
shit out here.

191
00:18:34,413 --> 00:18:35,937
Thank you.

192
00:18:40,285 --> 00:18:44,745
Sorry I was rude.
I'm just new around here.

193
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:49,522
Yeah. It's a dangerous neighborhood.

194
00:18:49,728 --> 00:18:53,721
I live across the hall.
My name is Danny Parker.

195
00:18:53,932 --> 00:18:57,163
Colette Vaughn. Thank you.

196
00:18:57,369 --> 00:18:59,462
Danny. Okay.

197
00:20:46,211 --> 00:20:48,839
My name is Tom Van Allen.

198
00:20:49,047 --> 00:20:51,345
I'm a trumpet player.

199
00:20:52,985 --> 00:20:55,579
My name is Tom Van Allen.

200
00:20:55,754 --> 00:20:58,348
I play the trumpet.

201
00:20:59,458 --> 00:21:04,725
My name is Tom Van Allen.
I'm a trumpet player.

202
00:21:54,913 --> 00:21:57,404
That hurts my heart.

203
00:21:58,183 --> 00:22:01,016
What a beautiful composition.

204
00:22:01,219 --> 00:22:03,710
And the performance?

205
00:22:04,589 --> 00:22:07,990
Tom Van Allen is nothing
short of dazzling...

206
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:12,324
...in his interpretation of Miles
Davis' haunting, moody piece.

207
00:22:12,531 --> 00:22:14,965
-Thank you.
-And he has a hot ass...

208
00:22:15,167 --> 00:22:17,260
...with hardly any hair on it.

209
00:22:17,436 --> 00:22:21,566
-Again, I thank you.
-No, I was talking about Miles.

210
00:22:26,078 --> 00:22:27,773
Don't!

211
00:22:34,219 --> 00:22:37,086
What do you think of when you play?

212
00:22:37,289 --> 00:22:43,250
I just think about what life would
be like without you.

213
00:22:45,063 --> 00:22:47,327
Let's spend the night here.

214
00:22:47,532 --> 00:22:50,194
-There are no motels here.
-No, no!

215
00:22:50,402 --> 00:22:52,427
Right here on the beach.

216
00:22:53,105 --> 00:22:56,632
Come on, let's do it.

217
00:23:09,688 --> 00:23:11,986
I got us lost.

218
00:23:13,859 --> 00:23:16,225
We should get going.

219
00:23:17,963 --> 00:23:20,363
Okay, we'll stay.

220
00:23:23,402 --> 00:23:25,302
We'll stay.

221
00:24:09,181 --> 00:24:10,671
Trust the system.

222
00:24:10,849 --> 00:24:15,309
I gave you this Bobby thing.
I've done a lot of busts for you.

223
00:24:15,487 --> 00:24:17,455
Put your cigarette out.

224
00:24:17,656 --> 00:24:20,591
We're in church.
Put your cigarette out.

225
00:24:20,792 --> 00:24:24,558
It's disrespectful, smoking
in front of the Virgin Mary.

226
00:24:26,998 --> 00:24:28,226
Whatever.

227
00:24:28,433 --> 00:24:32,802
So I work hard. I hate what I do
but I'm good at it, you know?

228
00:24:33,004 --> 00:24:35,234
-I'm industrious.
-Yes, you are.

229
00:24:35,607 --> 00:24:39,543
So why does Garcetti hate me?

230
00:24:40,479 --> 00:24:43,846
Come on, man. You can't
take Garcetti seriously.

231
00:24:44,049 --> 00:24:47,143
He hates everyone.

232
00:24:47,752 --> 00:24:50,687
He doesn't even like dolphins.

233
00:24:51,857 --> 00:24:55,486
You know that?
I'm not kidding you. He does.

234
00:24:55,694 --> 00:24:58,857
Seriously, the man hates dolphins.

235
00:24:59,064 --> 00:25:03,501
Have you ever heard of anyone
who doesn't like a dolphin?

236
00:25:03,702 --> 00:25:06,364
Garcetti is a dolphin-hater.

237
00:25:08,106 --> 00:25:10,666
-Hey, bro.
-What's up?

238
00:25:13,912 --> 00:25:16,039
How are you doing?

239
00:25:16,715 --> 00:25:18,410
You tell him yet?

240
00:25:18,617 --> 00:25:20,346
No, I was getting to it.

241
00:25:21,386 --> 00:25:22,375
What?

242
00:25:22,587 --> 00:25:27,718
Danny, it pains me to have to tell you
this, but remember Domingo?

243
00:25:27,926 --> 00:25:32,363
The wetback you helped us put away
for trafficking months back?

244
00:25:32,564 --> 00:25:36,864
It turns out that he's connected
to the Mexicali boys.

245
00:25:37,068 --> 00:25:39,935
Now his homeys are making
a lot of noise...

246
00:25:40,138 --> 00:25:44,268
...about hanging a Colombian
necktie on the rat.

247
00:25:44,876 --> 00:25:46,776
You know what that is?

248
00:25:46,945 --> 00:25:51,109
They cut a hole in your throat.
Pull your tongue out through it.

249
00:25:51,283 --> 00:25:53,478
-Fuck you!
-Interesting, isn't it?

250
00:25:53,685 --> 00:25:58,054
You have to take a hike.
Disappear. Protect yourself.

251
00:25:58,256 --> 00:26:00,588
You're not gonna protect me?

252
00:26:03,328 --> 00:26:07,264
I do bust after bust for you guys.

253
00:26:07,465 --> 00:26:10,434
For a solid year.
You're nothing without me.

254
00:26:10,635 --> 00:26:13,229
Over and over,
and you'd cut me loose?

255
00:26:13,405 --> 00:26:16,067
Your felony is dropped
to a misdemeanor.

256
00:26:16,241 --> 00:26:19,733
Your snitch card is full.
I'll clear it with the D.A.

257
00:26:19,911 --> 00:26:24,871
And you, my friend, are getting lost
before Domingo finds you.

258
00:26:25,317 --> 00:26:29,117
Now go. Get lost.

259
00:27:40,825 --> 00:27:43,055
I only deal in high-end weapons.

260
00:27:43,261 --> 00:27:46,458
All stolen, traceable
only to original owners.

261
00:27:46,665 --> 00:27:48,690
Glock, semiautomatic, 9 mm.

262
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:52,666
Tenifer matte finish, polymer grip,
4.5-inch barrel, 22 oz...

263
00:27:52,837 --> 00:27:54,702
...and a 10-round magazine.

264
00:27:54,906 --> 00:27:59,366
I could hook you up with this gun
for $350, well below market value.

265
00:27:59,577 --> 00:28:03,343
Maybe you're looking for something
with a chrome finish.

266
00:28:03,548 --> 00:28:06,813
A Llama Mini Max .38
Super Auto, semiautomatic.

267
00:28:06,985 --> 00:28:10,352
Satin chrome, rubber grip,
3-dot fixed sights...

268
00:28:10,522 --> 00:28:14,117
...3.5-inch barrel,
skeletonized handle, slide release.

269
00:28:14,292 --> 00:28:16,089
Eight-capacity magazine.

270
00:28:16,294 --> 00:28:20,993
I won't lie. This gun is not the bomb.
It will do the job.

271
00:28:21,199 --> 00:28:24,965
That's why you can walk out
with this gun for $150.

272
00:28:25,170 --> 00:28:29,630
Looking for power? This gun's got
mad power, kick and reputation.

273
00:28:29,808 --> 00:28:32,333
It's the Smith .357
Magnum revolver.

274
00:28:32,510 --> 00:28:37,447
Rubber combat-style grips, fixed rear,
ramp front sights, two-inch barrel.

275
00:28:37,615 --> 00:28:41,517
Weighs a feather 21 oz.,
8-shot capacity, double action.

276
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:45,383
For impact, the Magnum
will satisfy all your needs.

277
00:28:45,590 --> 00:28:50,152
These are my guns. All sales
are final. All prices are negotiable.

278
00:28:50,829 --> 00:28:54,788
Fuck! Where do you
find these people?

279
00:28:54,999 --> 00:28:57,194
The Del Amo Fashion Mall.

280
00:28:57,402 --> 00:28:59,165
Mostly.

281
00:29:00,105 --> 00:29:01,572
Mostly.

282
00:29:01,773 --> 00:29:04,207
What are you gonna do tonight?

283
00:29:04,409 --> 00:29:08,675
What am I gonna do? What are we
gonna do? What do you wanna do?

284
00:29:08,980 --> 00:29:11,505
Why do you need a gun anyway?

285
00:29:13,418 --> 00:29:16,251
It's a dangerous world.

286
00:29:17,689 --> 00:29:19,247
Open the door!

287
00:29:19,457 --> 00:29:22,688
-I'm not dressed!
-Yo, Mina!

288
00:29:22,894 --> 00:29:25,761
-Use your key!
-You mad-dogging me, bitch?

289
00:29:25,964 --> 00:29:29,229
No. I was just admiring your boots.

290
00:29:29,434 --> 00:29:31,959
Did you purchase them locally?

291
00:29:32,871 --> 00:29:35,362
Come on! I ain't got all fucking day!

292
00:29:35,573 --> 00:29:37,473
Okay, nice talking to you.

293
00:29:37,675 --> 00:29:41,111
-Yeah, fuck you. Let's go!
-Just a minute!

294
00:29:41,312 --> 00:29:42,540
Come on!

295
00:29:43,248 --> 00:29:48,550
How many fucking times I got to knock
on this door, you fucking bitch?

296
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:52,481
-Did you go through my shit?
-I didn't.

297
00:29:52,690 --> 00:29:57,457
How did you know it was there?
Fucking bitch! What were you doing?

298
00:29:57,662 --> 00:30:01,792
What the fuck were you doing?
Where's my shit?

299
00:30:01,966 --> 00:30:04,366
I put it there? What were you doing?

300
00:30:04,536 --> 00:30:07,699
-Get off me!
-What the fuck are you doing?

301
00:30:07,906 --> 00:30:11,069
-Come here!
-Get the fuck out of here.

302
00:30:11,276 --> 00:30:16,578
-What the fuck?
-Get off me!

303
00:30:44,909 --> 00:30:46,342
Bubba.

304
00:30:48,313 --> 00:30:50,543
Ride them, cowboy.

305
00:30:50,748 --> 00:30:53,444
It's a classy truck.

306
00:30:53,818 --> 00:30:55,979
You like that?

307
00:30:57,355 --> 00:31:00,085
You consider my proposition?

308
00:31:02,861 --> 00:31:07,958
Get in, hoss. We'll talk it over.

309
00:31:10,835 --> 00:31:15,932
Jimmy, listen to me.
I am in dire need of some cash.

310
00:31:18,076 --> 00:31:21,239
You see that?
That is what I am talking about.

311
00:31:21,446 --> 00:31:22,777
What?

312
00:31:22,947 --> 00:31:26,212
You're smooth. You use
words like "dire" and shit.

313
00:31:26,384 --> 00:31:28,352
You got language skills, son.

314
00:31:28,553 --> 00:31:33,456
-Jimmy.
-"I'm in dire need of some cash."

315
00:31:34,659 --> 00:31:36,217
Listen.

316
00:31:39,731 --> 00:31:44,964
I want to do a big score
with Pooh-Bear.

317
00:31:46,170 --> 00:31:49,298
And you know one of his dealers.

318
00:31:49,574 --> 00:31:52,941
That guy you were talking to,
Big Bill.

319
00:31:53,144 --> 00:31:55,874
-You can get ahold of him.
-Yeah.

320
00:31:56,080 --> 00:32:01,643
Hook me up with him. Tell him
I wanna make a deal with Pooh-Bear.

321
00:32:03,054 --> 00:32:05,454
Listen to me.

322
00:32:05,657 --> 00:32:09,024
Really listen to me, your friend.

323
00:32:09,227 --> 00:32:12,219
This guy is-- Okay.

324
00:32:13,131 --> 00:32:18,364
You are a circle of something that
is totally pure and full of light...

325
00:32:18,569 --> 00:32:22,801
...and that is totally smooth
and totally wonderful.

326
00:32:23,007 --> 00:32:27,376
And he can't even understand himself.
No one can understand it.

327
00:32:27,578 --> 00:32:30,445
It's just something
that has overtaken him.

328
00:32:30,615 --> 00:32:33,448
It's not him.
It's something that is on him.

329
00:32:33,618 --> 00:32:39,818
There's no him in there. And he
has this whole thing with his nose....

330
00:32:41,125 --> 00:32:43,150
But he's got the gak.

331
00:32:43,361 --> 00:32:44,988
Yeah.

332
00:32:47,966 --> 00:32:50,628
-So you in?
-Yeah!

333
00:32:52,537 --> 00:32:56,268
Finn's in!
What's the plan?

334
00:32:56,474 --> 00:33:00,137
I got a connection who wants
to buy a quarter's worth.

335
00:33:00,345 --> 00:33:05,305
No. Okay. A quarter is not even
anything he's in. That's nothing.

336
00:33:05,516 --> 00:33:07,484
A quarter of a million.

337
00:33:07,685 --> 00:33:09,016
Fuck!

338
00:33:10,688 --> 00:33:12,656
Fuck!

339
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:17,093
What's in it for us?

340
00:33:17,295 --> 00:33:20,093
A 10%finder's fee.

341
00:33:20,298 --> 00:33:22,198
What is that?
That's like--

342
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:27,428
Twenty-five grand.
You get five just for the ride.

343
00:33:28,239 --> 00:33:32,573
Come on, man!
Roll with the Cougar! Cougar!

344
00:33:40,051 --> 00:33:41,040
Finn.

345
00:33:41,252 --> 00:33:45,951
Might as well put a sign on the car
begging the cops to pull you over.

346
00:33:46,157 --> 00:33:48,717
You mean, to throw them off?

347
00:33:49,027 --> 00:33:51,222
Yeah, that's what I mean.

348
00:33:51,429 --> 00:33:54,660
-Where the hell does this guy live?
-Palmdale.

349
00:33:54,866 --> 00:33:57,562
Why do they call him Pooh-Bear?

350
00:33:57,769 --> 00:33:59,600
On account of his nose.

351
00:34:00,271 --> 00:34:04,071
-You have to explain that one.
-He doesn't have one.

352
00:34:05,576 --> 00:34:08,807
I'm sure it's me.
I'm not making the connection.

353
00:34:08,980 --> 00:34:13,314
The way Winnie the Pooh always
got his nose caught in the honey jar?

354
00:34:13,518 --> 00:34:17,750
Pooh-Bear did so much gak
they had to cut his nose off.

355
00:34:18,489 --> 00:34:23,256
Now he just has a plastic one. They
say he hasn't slept in over a year.

356
00:34:23,461 --> 00:34:27,727
-Bullshit.
-I've never seen him sleep. Seriously.

357
00:34:27,899 --> 00:34:31,300
Have you ever seen
Queen Elizabeth sleep?

358
00:34:31,469 --> 00:34:35,269
No. What, is she a tweeker?

359
00:34:38,242 --> 00:34:40,472
Yes, that's my point.

360
00:34:56,094 --> 00:34:59,086
Get ready, gentlemen!

361
00:34:59,931 --> 00:35:02,365
-Zapruder?
-Ready.

362
00:35:02,967 --> 00:35:05,868
And rolling.

363
00:35:06,037 --> 00:35:07,129
Oswald!

364
00:35:08,906 --> 00:35:09,998
Ready!

365
00:35:10,174 --> 00:35:12,642
-Grassy Knoll?
-Ready.

366
00:35:12,810 --> 00:35:16,906
-And the undeniable Third Shooter?
-Good to go.

367
00:35:17,081 --> 00:35:19,606
Okay, gentlemen, here we go.

368
00:35:21,619 --> 00:35:25,919
Jesus, look, here comes
the president now!

369
00:35:26,624 --> 00:35:31,527
That's the president of the United
States, ladies and gentlemen.

370
00:35:31,696 --> 00:35:35,530
Here he comes, waving to the crowd.

371
00:35:36,434 --> 00:35:39,198
Look at the first lady.

372
00:35:39,403 --> 00:35:43,499
She's looking radiant as ever. Lovely.

373
00:35:43,674 --> 00:35:48,043
As they turn the corner
into Dealey Plaza.

374
00:35:48,212 --> 00:35:51,113
Here we go, gentlemen.
Get ready.

375
00:35:52,116 --> 00:35:53,481
Get ready!

376
00:35:54,452 --> 00:35:56,283
Steady.

377
00:35:56,487 --> 00:35:57,920
Steady!

378
00:35:58,322 --> 00:36:00,051
Fire! Fire!

379
00:36:11,636 --> 00:36:13,661
That's shooting.

380
00:36:16,574 --> 00:36:20,977
Got a feeling there's a proposition
looming here, Danny-boy!

381
00:36:21,145 --> 00:36:26,447
I got a guy, reliable,
wants to buy a quarter's worth.

382
00:36:26,918 --> 00:36:28,442
Crank, huh?

383
00:36:28,619 --> 00:36:32,555
-No, glass. The good stuff.
-Glass.

384
00:36:32,790 --> 00:36:37,386
Can you handle that?
Can we talk price?

385
00:36:37,562 --> 00:36:40,998
Make me an offer.
Have a taste of this.

386
00:36:41,165 --> 00:36:45,465
-No, I'm good.
-It's delicious. Have a taste.

387
00:36:45,736 --> 00:36:48,466
I'm telling you, it's good.

388
00:36:50,408 --> 00:36:53,241
Have a taste. Come on.

389
00:36:59,250 --> 00:37:02,242
-Fantastic.
-Secret recipe.

390
00:37:04,889 --> 00:37:08,757
How about 14,000 a kilo?

391
00:37:09,126 --> 00:37:13,119
I only deal in U.S. pounds.
None of that faggot metric crap.

392
00:37:16,467 --> 00:37:21,200
That's around 40 pounds for...

393
00:37:22,773 --> 00:37:25,469
...6000 a pound.

394
00:37:25,643 --> 00:37:27,201
Okay.

395
00:37:29,614 --> 00:37:31,206
We got a deal.

396
00:37:31,415 --> 00:37:34,179
Anything for a dear friend.

397
00:37:35,820 --> 00:37:40,416
40 pounds at 6000 a pound.

398
00:37:41,025 --> 00:37:43,391
If you say so.

399
00:37:45,329 --> 00:37:49,766
I don't mean to be rude but I don't
think you're taking me seriously.

400
00:37:49,934 --> 00:37:52,903
It's you who's not taking me serious.

401
00:37:53,070 --> 00:37:55,038
I'm just here to do a deal.

402
00:37:55,206 --> 00:37:59,404
I welcomed you here
with open arms. I did.

403
00:38:00,378 --> 00:38:05,077
You're sitting here like some used
car salesman trying to lowball me.

404
00:38:05,249 --> 00:38:06,511
I'm not.

405
00:38:06,684 --> 00:38:10,643
I'll tell you about the last guy
who tried to jam me up.

406
00:38:10,821 --> 00:38:13,551
-I'm not.
-I love this goddamn story.

407
00:38:13,724 --> 00:38:19,560
This dude shorted me $11 . Thought I
wouldn't count it before I went home.

408
00:38:19,730 --> 00:38:21,493
He was wrong.

409
00:38:21,666 --> 00:38:23,463
You know what I did?

410
00:38:24,802 --> 00:38:27,566
I put his head in a vise.

411
00:38:28,472 --> 00:38:31,407
He's screaming.
You should have heard it.

412
00:38:31,575 --> 00:38:35,807
I cut this guy's skull open
with a hacksaw.

413
00:38:37,348 --> 00:38:40,010
I was staring at this boy's brain.

414
00:38:40,184 --> 00:38:43,153
I was thinking,
he doesn't need this thing.

415
00:38:43,321 --> 00:38:46,916
Anyone stupid enough
to try to jam me up...

416
00:38:47,925 --> 00:38:51,827
...must not have much use
for his brain.

417
00:38:53,397 --> 00:38:55,490
So I took it.

418
00:38:56,667 --> 00:38:59,534
I did. I keep it in the freezer.

419
00:38:59,704 --> 00:39:03,037
Every once in a while,
I cut off a slice...

420
00:39:03,207 --> 00:39:06,699
...and mix it up with my dinner.

421
00:39:08,045 --> 00:39:09,637
Or my breakfast.

422
00:39:16,887 --> 00:39:19,549
Ten thousand a pound.

423
00:39:24,628 --> 00:39:27,153
Thanks for your hospitality.

424
00:39:27,331 --> 00:39:31,199
Hang on. Nine thousand,
take it or leave it.

425
00:39:31,969 --> 00:39:34,995
I'll leave it.
Eight's as high as I can go.

426
00:39:35,406 --> 00:39:39,206
All right. Eight's good.
Eight sounds good, Danny-boy.

427
00:39:39,377 --> 00:39:44,440
It's where I was going. It's my lucky
number. Looks like we got a deal.

428
00:39:48,853 --> 00:39:51,014
You know, you got a lot of nerve.

429
00:39:51,188 --> 00:39:55,716
You got a lot of nerve.
Pooh-Bear likes that in a young man.

430
00:39:56,927 --> 00:39:59,293
Hey, hang on a second!

431
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:04,766
Wanna stay for lunch?

432
00:40:07,538 --> 00:40:11,975
I got your ass! I'm a dog!
Look at this:

433
00:40:12,610 --> 00:40:15,135
I'm a fucking dog!

434
00:40:16,046 --> 00:40:17,013
Shit!

435
00:40:21,051 --> 00:40:24,851
-Can I ask you a question?
-Sure.

436
00:40:25,623 --> 00:40:28,353
What does J.F.K. stand for?

437
00:40:28,526 --> 00:40:30,721
John Fitzgerald Kennedy.

438
00:40:30,895 --> 00:40:34,262
And he was the president
of the United States?

439
00:40:34,698 --> 00:40:37,223
And he was killed?

440
00:40:38,903 --> 00:40:41,770
They assassinated him.

441
00:40:44,175 --> 00:40:45,938
Hey, Danny.

442
00:40:46,477 --> 00:40:49,105
Thanks for not laughing at me.

443
00:41:01,225 --> 00:41:05,252
My wife's pimp knows a guy
at Cedars-Sinai medical lab.

444
00:41:05,429 --> 00:41:08,455
He's making a delivery
a week from Friday.

445
00:41:08,632 --> 00:41:09,690
Is it drugs?

446
00:41:09,867 --> 00:41:15,567
Better than drugs. It's Bob Hope's
stool specimen. We're gonna boost it.

447
00:41:16,173 --> 00:41:19,438
Why in the world
would you want to do that?

448
00:41:19,610 --> 00:41:20,975
So we can sell it.

449
00:41:21,145 --> 00:41:23,079
-To who?
-EBay.

450
00:41:23,914 --> 00:41:25,939
A collector. It's Bob Hope.

451
00:41:26,116 --> 00:41:28,311
He's a fucking national treasure.

452
00:41:28,486 --> 00:41:33,514
I mean, exactly. So here's the deal.
This here is the lab.

453
00:41:36,460 --> 00:41:38,291
What is that?

454
00:41:38,462 --> 00:41:40,896
-The lab.
-I mean, what kind of drink?

455
00:41:41,065 --> 00:41:44,296
-A Cuba Libre.
-What is that? Rum and Coke?

456
00:41:44,468 --> 00:41:48,370
-It's irrelevant.
-I gotta be clear on the details.

457
00:41:48,539 --> 00:41:50,166
-Can I taste this?
-No.

458
00:41:50,341 --> 00:41:53,868
Put the lab down and shut the fuck up.
Guys, focus.

459
00:41:54,044 --> 00:41:58,572
Danny, if I let you in on this,
the least you can do is pay atten--

460
00:41:58,749 --> 00:42:03,550
It gets frustrating. Focus.
Here we go. This here is the courier.

461
00:42:04,255 --> 00:42:09,249
This dude makes the deliveries
on the nose every Friday at 4 p.m.

462
00:42:09,593 --> 00:42:13,586
Alpha team will be in the elevator.
That's Danny and Creeper.

463
00:42:13,764 --> 00:42:18,167
We'll have night-vision goggles,
police scanner and two-way radios.

464
00:42:18,335 --> 00:42:21,793
It'll be badass!
Number Two team will be by the stairs.

465
00:42:21,972 --> 00:42:24,270
-That's me and Jimmy.
-Wait a second!

466
00:42:24,441 --> 00:42:26,409
-What about me?
-No chicks.

467
00:42:26,577 --> 00:42:28,010
-What?
-No chicks.

468
00:42:28,178 --> 00:42:29,236
No chicks?

469
00:42:29,413 --> 00:42:31,404
-Got a driver's license?
-Yeah.

470
00:42:31,582 --> 00:42:33,573
-Anyone else have one?
-No.

471
00:42:33,751 --> 00:42:38,688
So you can be the getaway chick.
Or you can be my fluffer.

472
00:42:39,189 --> 00:42:43,387
The Alpha team will follow the courier
out from the elevator.

473
00:42:47,932 --> 00:42:49,058
Kujo moving.

474
00:42:49,233 --> 00:42:54,637
Number Two team will cut the courier
off before he even gets to the lab.

475
00:42:59,877 --> 00:43:02,971
Facing superior numbers
and high-tech weapons...

476
00:43:03,147 --> 00:43:06,514
...the courier will have to comply
with our demands.

477
00:43:06,684 --> 00:43:09,118
-Get off it!
-Let go of the sample!

478
00:43:10,754 --> 00:43:14,884
You Outbreak-Iooking motherfucker!
Come on, drop it! Get up!

479
00:43:19,530 --> 00:43:22,055
Here's the beautiful part:
the getaway.

480
00:43:22,232 --> 00:43:25,998
Both teams will rappel
down the center of the staircase.

481
00:43:26,170 --> 00:43:29,799
Change clothes. Walk out the door
like nothing happened.

482
00:43:33,777 --> 00:43:35,039
I'm okay!

483
00:43:39,083 --> 00:43:40,607
Oh, fuck.

484
00:43:51,996 --> 00:43:54,123
Nice.

485
00:44:05,576 --> 00:44:08,511
-Danny, you in?
-I have to pass on this one.

486
00:44:08,679 --> 00:44:10,408
You'll what?

487
00:44:11,482 --> 00:44:13,575
He'll pass! Jimmy, you in?

488
00:44:14,551 --> 00:44:17,315
No, I'm good.

489
00:44:17,655 --> 00:44:20,089
Are you in or you out?

490
00:44:28,666 --> 00:44:30,964
What are you doing out here?

491
00:44:33,537 --> 00:44:35,698
Quincy. Oh, fuck.

492
00:44:35,873 --> 00:44:40,640
My boyfriend kicked me out.
Whatever.

493
00:44:42,479 --> 00:44:47,382
-You okay?
-Yeah, thank you. Good night.

494
00:44:49,086 --> 00:44:51,213
Okay, good night.

495
00:44:57,094 --> 00:45:00,621
-I'd invite you in, you know.
-No.

496
00:45:09,807 --> 00:45:11,798
Why don't you leave this guy?

497
00:45:13,610 --> 00:45:16,078
Not that easy.

498
00:45:19,049 --> 00:45:21,176
Yes, it is.

499
00:45:24,221 --> 00:45:26,348
What's this?

500
00:45:28,292 --> 00:45:30,783
You were married, huh?

501
00:45:32,963 --> 00:45:35,864
Was she everything to you?

502
00:45:37,935 --> 00:45:39,334
Yeah.

503
00:45:40,738 --> 00:45:42,501
That's nice.

504
00:45:44,775 --> 00:45:47,539
You have anyone like that?

505
00:45:47,845 --> 00:45:50,643
Yeah, I've got a kid.

506
00:45:51,181 --> 00:45:54,673
She's staying with my grandma
while I get another job.

507
00:45:54,852 --> 00:45:57,912
Well, look for another job.

508
00:45:58,889 --> 00:46:01,756
So where does Quincy fit in?

509
00:46:02,893 --> 00:46:05,657
I had a few medical bills.

510
00:46:05,829 --> 00:46:08,821
You'll have more
unless you get rid of him.

511
00:46:08,999 --> 00:46:11,729
Yeah, well, I will.

512
00:46:12,169 --> 00:46:14,865
One way or another, I will.

513
00:46:18,509 --> 00:46:22,946
Bubba, we're good. Pooh-Bear is in.
And you got the 250,000, right?

514
00:46:23,113 --> 00:46:25,274
So let's do it.

515
00:46:25,716 --> 00:46:27,115
Nope.

516
00:46:27,284 --> 00:46:28,683
What nope?

517
00:46:28,852 --> 00:46:30,877
I wanna do a small buy first.

518
00:46:31,054 --> 00:46:35,218
Ten thousand. Cash on the barrelhead.
We'll see how it goes.

519
00:46:35,392 --> 00:46:40,352
No! You said the whole whack now.
This guy is ready. I said you were.

520
00:46:40,531 --> 00:46:44,592
He'll think I'm a liar. It's gotta
be now. What's the difference?

521
00:46:44,768 --> 00:46:50,331
I don't know him.
And I don't really know you, partner.

522
00:46:50,541 --> 00:46:54,443
-That's downright insulting.
-You'll have to live with that.

523
00:46:54,611 --> 00:46:57,273
My money, my risk, my rules.

524
00:46:58,315 --> 00:47:03,878
You're in a very tenuous position
on the food chain, hoss.

525
00:47:05,522 --> 00:47:07,854
He won't like this. I'll take it....

526
00:47:08,025 --> 00:47:11,984
You believe this prick,
trying to pull this off without us?

527
00:47:12,162 --> 00:47:14,289
Motherfucker.

528
00:47:21,839 --> 00:47:23,898
-Fuck!
-Hey, dog.

529
00:47:24,074 --> 00:47:28,408
-What the fuck are you doing here?
-Hey. Jesus!

530
00:47:28,712 --> 00:47:33,445
You fucking scared me! I thought
I was in trouble for a second.

531
00:47:35,686 --> 00:47:37,381
Quit lying to me.

532
00:47:41,658 --> 00:47:46,789
Did you really think you were slick
enough to pull this off by yourself?

533
00:47:47,231 --> 00:47:48,755
-I don't know.
-Did you?

534
00:47:49,066 --> 00:47:53,196
I didn't want to do anything without--
You told me to get lost.

535
00:47:53,370 --> 00:47:57,431
I was just trying to do a good score
so I could get lost.

536
00:47:57,608 --> 00:48:00,941
I'm supposed to sit around
till Domingo kills me?

537
00:48:01,111 --> 00:48:02,703
Who's on the other end?

538
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:06,281
Pooh-Bear is his nickname.
I don't know his name.

539
00:48:06,450 --> 00:48:10,147
He's a cook and a dealer in Palmdale.

540
00:48:10,320 --> 00:48:15,417
I'll just do whatever you want. I'll
call the dude, tell him it's over.

541
00:48:15,592 --> 00:48:16,923
Wrong, pal.

542
00:48:17,094 --> 00:48:20,029
You're gonna roll over
on these guys.

543
00:48:20,831 --> 00:48:23,026
-What?
-You don't have a choice.

544
00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:28,263
We can go fed on your ass right now.
Ongoing criminal conspiracy.

545
00:48:28,572 --> 00:48:32,599
Intent to buy and distribute
250 G's worth of crank.

546
00:48:32,776 --> 00:48:36,268
-What's the mandatory on that?
-Ten years minimum.

547
00:48:36,446 --> 00:48:37,845
Yeah.

548
00:48:38,415 --> 00:48:42,943
And believe me, word will go out that
you rolled over and snitched.

549
00:48:43,120 --> 00:48:48,251
And that's not good in prison, dog.
That's not good at all.

550
00:49:27,898 --> 00:49:30,958
Holland Dale Monty, a.k.a. Pooh-Bear.

551
00:49:31,134 --> 00:49:35,571
Served five years for beating a pimp
to death with a wheelchair.

552
00:49:35,739 --> 00:49:38,173
-That sounds right.
-Here's the scoop.

553
00:49:38,342 --> 00:49:41,971
Pooh-Bear scores dope
by ripping off other slingers.

554
00:49:42,145 --> 00:49:43,669
See how lucky you are?

555
00:49:43,847 --> 00:49:47,715
What's to stop him from doing me
as soon as I get in the room?

556
00:49:47,884 --> 00:49:52,048
-We're coordinating with Palmdale P.D.
-That makes me feel good.

557
00:49:52,322 --> 00:49:54,085
No need to worry.

558
00:49:54,257 --> 00:49:59,661
Do everything by the book.
Pooh-Bear goes down, nobody gets hurt.

559
00:49:59,830 --> 00:50:01,730
What about the other thing?

560
00:50:01,898 --> 00:50:06,460
-Yeah, the menacing silver car.
-Did you check the license plate?

561
00:50:07,004 --> 00:50:09,734
-Brace yourself.
-The Domingo boys?

562
00:50:09,906 --> 00:50:13,808
-It's much worse.
-Don't fuck with me! What is it?

563
00:50:14,077 --> 00:50:16,272
It's a teacher.

564
00:50:17,447 --> 00:50:20,416
The car is registered
to a Mrs. Nancy Plummer.

565
00:50:20,584 --> 00:50:22,415
She's 57 years old!

566
00:50:22,586 --> 00:50:28,218
She's been a third-grade
school teacher for the last 33 years!

567
00:50:28,392 --> 00:50:32,226
Have you been tweeking
with the higher education?

568
00:50:32,396 --> 00:50:36,162
You're getting paranoid.
You better lay off the gak.

569
00:50:51,948 --> 00:50:55,543
Cliff saw you downtown
a few weeks ago.

570
00:50:55,719 --> 00:50:58,688
That's how we tracked you down.

571
00:50:58,855 --> 00:51:03,155
He said you looked so bad
he barely recognized you.

572
00:51:03,593 --> 00:51:07,393
Billy's a narcotics officer now,
you know.

573
00:51:13,570 --> 00:51:15,800
We want to help you.

574
00:51:17,974 --> 00:51:23,071
Look, I know that everybody deals
with grief in their own way.

575
00:51:23,246 --> 00:51:28,980
I know how hard it is to find closure.

576
00:51:32,189 --> 00:51:37,957
For myself, I feel I have finally
found it in my heart...

577
00:51:38,128 --> 00:51:41,859
...to forgive those people
that killed my daughter.

578
00:51:42,032 --> 00:51:46,992
I gave my grief to Jesus Christ
and it helps.

579
00:51:47,170 --> 00:51:52,938
I'm really happy that you found
some peace. That's good.

580
00:51:53,777 --> 00:51:58,373
I want you to leave me alone.
Do you understand?

581
00:51:58,949 --> 00:52:00,280
Listen.

582
00:52:00,450 --> 00:52:06,787
Nancy has been coming downtown.
I've seen her and it's dangerous.

583
00:52:06,957 --> 00:52:10,757
Just make her stay away, okay?

584
00:52:26,076 --> 00:52:27,168
Turn around.

585
00:52:27,344 --> 00:52:30,643
My guy changed the deal.
I want to talk to Pooh-Bear.

586
00:52:30,814 --> 00:52:34,477
-I'll tell him for you.
-That's his.

587
00:52:34,651 --> 00:52:37,381
Don't say a fucking word.

588
00:52:47,230 --> 00:52:50,631
-Pooh-Bear, what's up?
-He's blue.

589
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:54,395
We're coming down
from a ten-day ride, man.

590
00:52:58,175 --> 00:53:00,507
Pull your pants down.

591
00:53:02,345 --> 00:53:05,712
-You heard him.
-Pull your motherfucking pants down!

592
00:53:05,882 --> 00:53:09,909
-What the fuck you talking about?
-Little Bill.

593
00:53:14,057 --> 00:53:18,721
Put your fucking hands up.
Put your fucking hands up. Come on!

594
00:53:24,434 --> 00:53:28,871
I told you he's a good-Iooking
young man. Shit!

595
00:53:29,039 --> 00:53:30,404
You know...

596
00:53:31,541 --> 00:53:35,375
...sometimes a man will do...

597
00:53:37,214 --> 00:53:41,776
...almost anything...

598
00:53:41,952 --> 00:53:44,546
...to get what he wants.

599
00:53:44,721 --> 00:53:47,417
I've done some things.

600
00:53:56,066 --> 00:53:59,524
Introduce him to Captain Steubing.

601
00:54:05,609 --> 00:54:08,077
Hey, now, listen.

602
00:54:09,312 --> 00:54:12,145
We don't have a deal, fine.
I'll just go.

603
00:54:12,315 --> 00:54:14,340
What do you want me to say?

604
00:54:14,517 --> 00:54:17,077
Captain hasn't eaten in over a week.

605
00:54:17,287 --> 00:54:20,779
That and the rabies don't make
for a happy badger.

606
00:54:20,991 --> 00:54:25,087
Now, he thinks that you might
work for the police.

607
00:54:25,262 --> 00:54:26,957
That's crazy!

608
00:54:27,130 --> 00:54:31,089
Don't impress me. I'm not the one
making the accusations.

609
00:54:31,701 --> 00:54:34,602
Address Captain Steubing.

610
00:54:34,771 --> 00:54:38,730
-Go ahead.
-Captain, this is crazy.

611
00:54:38,908 --> 00:54:42,810
I don't know what you heard,
who you heard it from...

612
00:54:42,979 --> 00:54:47,609
...but I'm not a cop.
I don't know if you've checked me out.

613
00:54:47,817 --> 00:54:50,547
I don't think he believes you.

614
00:54:50,720 --> 00:54:52,847
Drop your package in the cage.

615
00:54:53,023 --> 00:54:57,119
There's an idea. Maybe put
your pee-pee in the hole there.

616
00:54:57,627 --> 00:55:00,790
I'm not gonna do that. Listen.

617
00:55:00,964 --> 00:55:03,899
Come on. Come on, boy.

618
00:55:08,571 --> 00:55:12,564
You better start talking
because he's going to get you!

619
00:55:12,742 --> 00:55:15,074
All right! Okay, okay.

620
00:55:15,245 --> 00:55:19,545
If you're gonna say something,
you gotta say it now!

621
00:55:19,983 --> 00:55:22,543
Jesus! Jesus!

622
00:55:23,420 --> 00:55:26,651
It's Little Bill!
He was talking shit about you.

623
00:55:26,823 --> 00:55:31,817
He's cutting you out. That's why
you guys had trouble lately.

624
00:55:31,995 --> 00:55:35,158
I saw him. He took the money
I brought you. $10,000.

625
00:55:35,332 --> 00:55:38,927
He talked about how you'd lost it.
He's carrying it.

626
00:55:39,102 --> 00:55:43,766
-Shut the fuck up. He's lying.
-He's got your money!

627
00:55:43,940 --> 00:55:48,536
People say things when they're
sporting badger food for a pecker.

628
00:55:48,712 --> 00:55:49,906
Right!

629
00:55:50,080 --> 00:55:54,710
Then again, people do a lot of things
when they're around money.

630
00:55:54,884 --> 00:55:57,682
-It ain't bad to check it out.
-Come on!

631
00:55:57,854 --> 00:56:00,846
-Just checking.
-What kind of shit is this?

632
00:56:01,024 --> 00:56:05,518
-How do we know if we don't check?
-This is bullshit!

633
00:56:05,695 --> 00:56:07,663
-What is this?
-Little Bill?

634
00:56:07,831 --> 00:56:14,202
It's not what you think, Pooh.
Tell them, man! It's not--

635
00:56:23,513 --> 00:56:25,572
What the fuck was that?

636
00:56:28,051 --> 00:56:30,849
I mean, what was that?!

637
00:56:31,020 --> 00:56:34,148
This was supposed to be a test.
Ten grand.

638
00:56:34,324 --> 00:56:38,727
10,000 worth of good glass
and then 250. Fuck.

639
00:56:38,895 --> 00:56:42,854
-You got to take it easy.
-Can I have a glass of water?

640
00:56:43,032 --> 00:56:45,728
I'll get you some water.

641
00:56:46,469 --> 00:56:49,097
Oh, God! Pooh, please!

642
00:56:53,143 --> 00:56:56,135
Dear Mother of God, Bill!
Bill, please!

643
00:56:57,580 --> 00:57:01,949
Thank you. That shit wasn't right.

644
00:57:03,052 --> 00:57:07,921
Can you shut him up
over there, please? Shut up!

645
00:57:08,091 --> 00:57:10,491
I've got my sample here.

646
00:57:22,305 --> 00:57:26,503
-I sense a little apprehension.
-No, no. I just....

647
00:57:26,676 --> 00:57:28,803
You're making me nervous.

648
00:57:32,348 --> 00:57:36,842
You're not gonna back out
on this thing, are you?

649
00:57:37,020 --> 00:57:39,614
Please don't do that.

650
00:57:40,356 --> 00:57:44,690
That would sincerely hurt my feelings.

651
00:57:52,769 --> 00:57:54,293
Danny.

652
00:57:54,971 --> 00:57:57,337
Danny, are you there?

653
00:57:59,576 --> 00:58:01,874
Oh, Jesus.

654
00:58:05,849 --> 00:58:09,341
If I could just stand here
for a moment, I'll be fine.

655
00:58:09,519 --> 00:58:11,316
Sure.

656
00:58:15,225 --> 00:58:17,318
Thank you.

657
00:58:26,069 --> 00:58:28,003
Thank you.

658
00:58:46,089 --> 00:58:48,922
Look at us. What a pair, huh?

659
00:58:50,493 --> 00:58:53,428
Can I try that again?

660
00:58:54,564 --> 00:58:56,657
I can't.

661
00:58:57,700 --> 00:58:59,031
Shit.

662
00:58:59,502 --> 00:59:01,697
You should go.

663
00:59:09,579 --> 00:59:11,410
What's going on?

664
00:59:14,083 --> 00:59:16,608
There's someone else.

665
00:59:17,420 --> 00:59:18,751
Yes.

666
00:59:20,623 --> 00:59:26,584
It's okay. But I still owe you
for a cup of coffee, whenever--

667
00:59:26,763 --> 00:59:28,788
No, wait.

668
00:59:29,666 --> 00:59:31,258
Don't go.

669
00:59:34,637 --> 00:59:37,071
I want to talk.

670
00:59:40,243 --> 00:59:42,768
Tired of lying.

671
00:59:43,413 --> 00:59:48,112
What you want to do is you wanna
go back the way you came.

672
00:59:48,284 --> 00:59:52,482
Make a left at the bottom.
It'll take you back to the highway.

673
00:59:52,655 --> 00:59:54,589
That's it?

674
00:59:57,560 --> 01:00:00,290
Do you mind if I use your bathroom?

675
01:00:00,463 --> 01:00:06,299
Sure. Go past the TV, turn right,
it's the first door on your left.

676
01:00:06,469 --> 01:00:08,835
-Do you mind?
-Make it fast.

677
01:02:02,218 --> 01:02:03,549
Let's go.

678
01:02:52,635 --> 01:02:55,331
I could have done something.

679
01:02:56,239 --> 01:02:58,434
They would have killed you too.

680
01:02:58,608 --> 01:03:01,099
I could have fought.

681
01:03:01,744 --> 01:03:04,110
I could have died.

682
01:03:06,082 --> 01:03:08,516
I'm dying now.

683
01:03:11,988 --> 01:03:15,549
You're not dying. You're right here.

684
01:03:19,195 --> 01:03:21,254
Listen.

685
01:03:24,467 --> 01:03:27,197
I want to do something good.

686
01:03:27,770 --> 01:03:30,170
I want to help you with Quincy.

687
01:03:30,339 --> 01:03:32,705
You can't help me with Quincy.

688
01:03:32,875 --> 01:03:37,574
Yes, there's something I can do.
Come on.

689
01:03:43,820 --> 01:03:46,345
Here, take this.

690
01:03:48,391 --> 01:03:50,416
I can't take that.

691
01:03:50,593 --> 01:03:53,153
No, it's not what you think.

692
01:03:54,230 --> 01:04:00,567
This is my pager number. Take this bag
and hide it where he can't find it.

693
01:04:00,736 --> 01:04:04,570
When you know he'll be there a while,
page me, then leave.

694
01:04:04,740 --> 01:04:06,037
Why?

695
01:04:06,209 --> 01:04:10,009
Some guys will take care of him.
You won't see him again.

696
01:04:10,179 --> 01:04:13,342
-I don't want to do this.
-They're cops.

697
01:04:13,516 --> 01:04:17,111
I work with them. I messed up.
You can fix this.

698
01:04:17,286 --> 01:04:19,652
Do it for your daughter.

699
01:04:32,468 --> 01:04:36,905
Yo, man, I ain't got nothing!
Get these cuffs off me!

700
01:04:42,678 --> 01:04:45,340
-Bubba.
-Yes?

701
01:04:45,514 --> 01:04:47,846
-You got the money?
-Yep.

702
01:04:48,017 --> 01:04:49,382
Okay.

703
01:04:49,552 --> 01:04:54,285
Make sure you come alone because
Pooh-Bear doesn't like surprises.

704
01:04:54,457 --> 01:04:56,891
I ain't an idiot, asshole.

705
01:04:57,059 --> 01:04:59,186
See you tonight.

706
01:04:59,829 --> 01:05:02,662
A man of few words.

707
01:05:02,832 --> 01:05:05,426
What's up? You nervous?

708
01:05:05,635 --> 01:05:07,796
Are you clowns watching my back?

709
01:05:07,970 --> 01:05:12,805
Make sure you hit the floor when we
come in. It could get ugly in there.

710
01:05:12,975 --> 01:05:16,103
We don't want
to accidentally shoot you.

711
01:05:49,011 --> 01:05:52,105
-How did it go?
-You tell me.

712
01:05:54,016 --> 01:05:56,814
You ready to go meet the team?

713
01:05:56,986 --> 01:05:58,817
Well, get in, hoss.

714
01:06:14,136 --> 01:06:19,904
For those of you who don't know, this
is Tom Van Allen, a.k.a. Danny Parker.

715
01:06:20,076 --> 01:06:23,534
A year ago, Mr. Van Allen's
wife was murdered...

716
01:06:23,713 --> 01:06:26,648
...in a meth lab
out near the Salton Sea.

717
01:06:26,816 --> 01:06:29,080
No one was ever apprehended.

718
01:06:29,251 --> 01:06:34,712
Local authorities assumed it was a
home intrusion by rival drug dealers.

719
01:06:34,890 --> 01:06:39,759
Until Tom took it upon himself
to conduct a one-man operation...

720
01:06:39,929 --> 01:06:42,955
...at great risk to his own
personal safety.

721
01:06:43,132 --> 01:06:47,091
-He's a civilian?
-Yeah, he's a civilian.

722
01:06:47,703 --> 01:06:49,466
How did you pull this off?

723
01:06:51,674 --> 01:06:55,735
-You saw one of the perpetrators?
-No. I was in the bathroom.

724
01:06:57,947 --> 01:07:01,110
In the house? What about the house?

725
01:07:02,018 --> 01:07:04,452
In the house.

726
01:07:05,221 --> 01:07:09,123
Did you see a hair color?

727
01:07:09,291 --> 01:07:12,351
They had masks on. I didn't see....

728
01:07:12,528 --> 01:07:17,693
Forensics found this red hair
on your wife's body.

729
01:07:18,667 --> 01:07:20,430
That's how it started.

730
01:07:22,204 --> 01:07:25,901
We'd stopped for gas
at the Salton Sea.

731
01:07:26,709 --> 01:07:29,837
I had seen a man with red hair.

732
01:07:32,348 --> 01:07:35,909
It was the ring that drew
my attention.

733
01:07:37,653 --> 01:07:38,813
I knew the ring.

734
01:07:39,789 --> 01:07:44,123
-What is it?
-Nothing.

735
01:07:45,961 --> 01:07:50,364
-Why didn't you tell him?
-I wanted to find him myself.

736
01:07:51,033 --> 01:07:54,434
-I wanted to kill him.
-What about the ring?

737
01:07:55,771 --> 01:07:57,739
It was a college ring.

738
01:07:57,907 --> 01:08:02,469
Central Valley.
Where my father once taught music.

739
01:08:04,280 --> 01:08:07,443
I tracked him to the
L.A. Sheriff's Department.

740
01:08:07,616 --> 01:08:12,076
I would have killed him right there
but I had to be positive.

741
01:08:12,254 --> 01:08:16,452
Even if Morgan was involved,
I had to be sure about Garcetti.

742
01:08:16,659 --> 01:08:18,957
So I became Danny Parker.

743
01:08:19,128 --> 01:08:20,618
Oh, shit!

744
01:08:20,796 --> 01:08:22,661
Son of a bitch!

745
01:08:23,933 --> 01:08:26,299
What the fuck?

746
01:08:28,604 --> 01:08:31,971
I dropped myself right in their laps.

747
01:08:32,842 --> 01:08:34,434
Morgan.

748
01:08:35,478 --> 01:08:37,207
Well, well, well.

749
01:08:37,880 --> 01:08:40,644
I was a perfect rat.

750
01:08:41,417 --> 01:08:46,184
I did whatever they wanted,
gave up whoever they asked for.

751
01:08:46,722 --> 01:08:50,055
But I knew I had to go further.

752
01:08:50,292 --> 01:08:52,886
I had to get closer.

753
01:08:56,232 --> 01:08:59,724
I needed a big buyer.
It had to be a perfect setup.

754
01:08:59,902 --> 01:09:04,168
One that I knew they would hit
even if they didn't include me.

755
01:09:04,907 --> 01:09:09,276
-But it never happened.
-That's when he called me.

756
01:09:10,079 --> 01:09:14,812
We had a C.I. call Morgan and Garcetti
with an anonymous tip about it.

757
01:09:14,984 --> 01:09:19,011
You believe this prick,
trying to pull this off without us?

758
01:09:19,188 --> 01:09:20,519
Motherfucker.

759
01:09:21,157 --> 01:09:24,718
I dumped a dummy file into the system.

760
01:09:24,927 --> 01:09:30,422
We got the 411 on your boy. Appears
to be a major trafficker in Texas.

761
01:09:30,599 --> 01:09:33,864
Jumped bail on a murder
charge last April.

762
01:09:34,036 --> 01:09:35,526
Murder? Beautiful.

763
01:09:35,704 --> 01:09:38,036
Pumped 57 slugs
into a police informant.

764
01:09:38,207 --> 01:09:41,005
They took the bait and we were off.

765
01:09:41,177 --> 01:09:44,044
This is bullshit.
This guy's a fucking rat.

766
01:09:44,213 --> 01:09:47,046
How do you know you're not jamming
two good cops?

767
01:09:47,316 --> 01:09:51,309
All you have is one red hair.
It's still your only evidence.

768
01:09:51,487 --> 01:09:56,686
Not anymore. We tapped their phones
and computers at the sheriff's office.

769
01:09:56,859 --> 01:10:00,590
Morgan and Garcetti have not filed
one report on this deal.

770
01:10:00,763 --> 01:10:06,326
They haven't coordinated with Palmdale
P.D. They're keeping it off the books.

771
01:10:06,502 --> 01:10:10,063
It looks like we got the right guys.

772
01:10:10,639 --> 01:10:13,403
We'll find out for sure tonight.

773
01:10:13,576 --> 01:10:17,068
They called me a fucking rat.
They don't believe me.

774
01:10:17,246 --> 01:10:23,446
Get Pooh-Bear to meet at the Tropic
Motel. Everything will work out fine.

775
01:10:28,791 --> 01:10:32,784
Oh, come on now.
You are doing the right thing.

776
01:10:32,962 --> 01:10:35,123
I don't see you have any choice.

777
01:10:35,297 --> 01:10:38,494
You wouldn't have stood a chance
with those boys.

778
01:10:38,667 --> 01:10:43,934
I need you to do your part. And I
give you my word that I'll do mine.

779
01:10:44,406 --> 01:10:46,738
I'm counting on you.

780
01:10:49,178 --> 01:10:51,043
Catch.

781
01:10:52,581 --> 01:10:54,913
It's $10,000.

782
01:10:57,152 --> 01:11:01,282
What I want you to do is worth more
but it's all I could get.

783
01:11:02,391 --> 01:11:07,158
You only owe me five. That's not
till after we close the deal tonight.

784
01:11:09,999 --> 01:11:14,959
I don't want you to come with me.
I want you to do me a solid instead.

785
01:11:15,871 --> 01:11:18,965
-Okay.
-Let me tell you what it is first.

786
01:11:19,141 --> 01:11:22,872
It doesn't matter. I'll do it.
And you don't have to pay me.

787
01:11:23,045 --> 01:11:26,037
-Why?
-Like, you're my best friend.

788
01:11:26,215 --> 01:11:28,308
I'd do anything for you.

789
01:11:28,517 --> 01:11:31,042
-Wait.
-Listen.

790
01:11:31,220 --> 01:11:34,189
Are you ready? Come on, be ready.

791
01:11:34,356 --> 01:11:36,221
-Listen--
-Check that out.

792
01:11:36,392 --> 01:11:39,122
-What is that?
-It's you.

793
01:11:40,562 --> 01:11:42,154
Check it out.

794
01:11:43,299 --> 01:11:47,599
I didn't have a picture
so I described you. Good job, right?

795
01:11:47,770 --> 01:11:49,738
You like it?

796
01:11:50,673 --> 01:11:53,267
-It rocks.
-Seriously?

797
01:11:53,442 --> 01:11:57,401
-I know it's a little weird. It's not?
-You're insane.

798
01:11:57,579 --> 01:12:01,879
My God, it will be so fucking A-plus
after tonight. Seriously.

799
01:12:02,051 --> 01:12:04,019
We'll lay out a mile of crank.

800
01:12:04,186 --> 01:12:07,246
You start at that end
and I start at this end.

801
01:12:08,490 --> 01:12:10,856
-Quit that shit.
-What?

802
01:12:11,060 --> 01:12:13,085
I quit, Jimmy.

803
01:12:13,295 --> 01:12:18,392
I came over here to tell you
I'm going straight and to say goodbye.

804
01:12:18,567 --> 01:12:20,000
What?

805
01:12:20,502 --> 01:12:22,868
Will you sit down?

806
01:12:28,344 --> 01:12:31,643
Look, I'm not a dealer, okay?

807
01:12:31,814 --> 01:12:34,840
Hey, just chill.
Seriously, it's okay, Danny.

808
01:12:35,184 --> 01:12:38,153
I'm not Danny!

809
01:12:40,222 --> 01:12:44,181
I'm sorry. I'm not Danny, okay?
Are you listening?

810
01:12:44,360 --> 01:12:46,351
I'm not Danny Parker.

811
01:12:46,528 --> 01:12:49,725
I became Danny Parker. He's a rat.

812
01:12:49,898 --> 01:12:53,527
He.... I'm not a dealer.

813
01:12:53,702 --> 01:12:57,763
Everything I've ever said
to you is a lie.

814
01:12:58,874 --> 01:13:00,705
I'm a rat.

815
01:13:00,876 --> 01:13:05,313
But I became a rat for a good reason.

816
01:13:06,548 --> 01:13:09,540
-What's the reason?
-I can't tell you.

817
01:13:09,718 --> 01:13:11,845
Why not?

818
01:13:13,756 --> 01:13:16,657
Why not?
Because you don't trust me.

819
01:13:16,825 --> 01:13:20,283
-No, Jimmy, no.
-You don't trust me.

820
01:13:25,467 --> 01:13:31,497
Everything, like, everything that
you said is a lie. Right?

821
01:13:32,708 --> 01:13:35,438
And you're not who you say you are.

822
01:13:35,611 --> 01:13:39,638
And you're like-- What the fuck
is that? You don't like me!

823
01:13:39,815 --> 01:13:41,544
No, that's not it.

824
01:13:41,717 --> 01:13:45,346
That's not it.
That's not what I'm saying at all.

825
01:13:45,521 --> 01:13:48,513
You're my friend, okay?

826
01:13:48,957 --> 01:13:53,360
You're my only friend.
I wasn't lying about that.

827
01:13:53,529 --> 01:13:59,365
But all of what I've done
is for this plan, okay?

828
01:14:00,969 --> 01:14:06,202
It didn't work.
I'm just trying to make it right.

829
01:14:06,375 --> 01:14:10,971
I really need your help.

830
01:14:11,680 --> 01:14:15,514
But I understand.

831
01:14:18,253 --> 01:14:20,847
What do you want me to do?

832
01:14:31,967 --> 01:14:35,494
I'm on my last smoke.
I gotta pull over and get more.

833
01:15:00,229 --> 01:15:02,060
A pack of GCPs.

834
01:15:02,364 --> 01:15:04,229
$2.75.

835
01:15:41,970 --> 01:15:45,770
This is the Red Team.
We're in position.

836
01:15:47,809 --> 01:15:50,471
All right, people, heads up.

837
01:16:00,756 --> 01:16:04,715
-How are you doing, Joe?
-Copy. I have a visual.

838
01:16:11,066 --> 01:16:14,263
Okay, it's all yours.
Keep it safe, please.

839
01:16:25,380 --> 01:16:30,716
-It's about a half-hour till kickoff.
-Pooh-Bear needs a little landscaping.

840
01:17:03,785 --> 01:17:06,345
Any word from Pooh-Bear?

841
01:17:06,955 --> 01:17:08,582
You okay, hoss?

842
01:17:10,792 --> 01:17:13,226
What in the hell?

843
01:17:14,496 --> 01:17:17,158
Danny told me to tell you
he was sorry...

844
01:17:17,332 --> 01:17:21,359
...and that he was gonna
take care of things himself.

845
01:17:22,204 --> 01:17:24,297
Goddamn it.

846
01:17:30,712 --> 01:17:33,510
Our boy's a 97.

847
01:17:37,552 --> 01:17:40,180
Where is Bubba?

848
01:17:41,023 --> 01:17:43,583
Maybe he's not coming.

849
01:17:43,992 --> 01:17:45,584
Shit.

850
01:17:47,162 --> 01:17:50,461
Danny, what the fuck are you doing?

851
01:17:54,636 --> 01:17:56,797
Where's the money?

852
01:17:56,972 --> 01:17:59,941
Tell me he's got the money.

853
01:18:00,575 --> 01:18:04,841
Yeah, our friendly is definitely
handling the cash.

854
01:18:25,600 --> 01:18:27,295
Ready?

855
01:18:29,604 --> 01:18:31,697
Let's do it.

856
01:18:43,618 --> 01:18:47,281
I can't get little piglets
out of my mind.

857
01:18:47,456 --> 01:18:53,258
I think of one in particular
with cutout crotch panties.

858
01:18:53,428 --> 01:18:55,521
What's happening?

859
01:18:57,132 --> 01:19:00,465
-He's clean.
-It's high card, boys.

860
01:19:01,103 --> 01:19:02,695
We gonna do a deal?

861
01:19:02,871 --> 01:19:05,704
High card wins, gentlemen.

862
01:19:06,174 --> 01:19:08,108
On three, boys.

863
01:19:08,276 --> 01:19:12,337
-Three. I got a queen of diamonds.
-Shit.

864
01:19:12,514 --> 01:19:14,505
Suicide king of hearts.

865
01:19:14,683 --> 01:19:17,948
-You're the man.
-Yes, I am.

866
01:19:18,220 --> 01:19:21,087
-I'll take a piss.
-All right.

867
01:19:22,891 --> 01:19:27,021
-What are you playing?
-Hole in the head.

868
01:19:30,966 --> 01:19:33,628
Don't you want to play for real money?

869
01:19:33,802 --> 01:19:37,704
-Fucking asshole!
-Skipper, goddamn it! Calm down.

870
01:19:37,873 --> 01:19:41,604
-Get yourself a beer, boy!
-You stupid motherfucker.

871
01:19:48,016 --> 01:19:51,349
He's a little upset there.

872
01:19:52,320 --> 01:19:54,982
Here we go. Look at this.

873
01:19:55,624 --> 01:19:59,788
Look at this here. Good job, Danny.

874
01:19:59,961 --> 01:20:05,991
That's a lot of money there.
Jesus. It's enough to make you weep.

875
01:20:07,402 --> 01:20:09,302
Bill!

876
01:20:11,439 --> 01:20:15,569
Bill, you ought to come in here
and see this!

877
01:20:15,877 --> 01:20:21,144
Bill! It's a hell of a lot of money!

878
01:20:23,084 --> 01:20:25,518
That's just really beautiful.

879
01:20:32,494 --> 01:20:33,859
Hot damn!

880
01:20:38,466 --> 01:20:40,400
Damn it! Shit!

881
01:20:40,602 --> 01:20:42,331
Hell!

882
01:20:51,546 --> 01:20:54,413
When are you gonna go away?

883
01:21:26,548 --> 01:21:31,315
That's okay.
That's how it's gonna be.

884
01:21:31,486 --> 01:21:35,479
That's how I'm going. I'm going.
I could be....

885
01:21:35,657 --> 01:21:40,458
I could be a cowboy
if I only had a half a chance.

886
01:21:42,163 --> 01:21:47,396
I'm just a little boy on a goddamn
rocking horse, that's all!

887
01:21:51,006 --> 01:21:54,066
That's all right, that's all right.

888
01:21:54,709 --> 01:22:00,614
That's okay.
I know, I'm just a little boy.

889
01:22:02,784 --> 01:22:05,252
That's all.

890
01:22:07,656 --> 01:22:09,988
That's okay.

891
01:22:13,595 --> 01:22:16,462
I'm fine!

892
01:22:26,374 --> 01:22:32,802
Just a little boy on a rocking horse.
Ain't no big thing.

893
01:22:34,649 --> 01:22:36,549
No big thing at all.

894
01:22:47,662 --> 01:22:50,222
I'm gonna be all right.

895
01:22:57,005 --> 01:22:58,939
Jesus.

896
01:23:04,245 --> 01:23:05,735
That's all.

897
01:23:08,616 --> 01:23:12,108
That's all you get, cowboy.

898
01:23:12,887 --> 01:23:14,684
Goddamn!

899
01:23:20,061 --> 01:23:22,120
All clear!

900
01:23:23,631 --> 01:23:26,464
Did we all end at the same time?

901
01:25:55,049 --> 01:25:57,074
It's okay.

902
01:25:58,453 --> 01:26:00,751
It's okay.

903
01:26:36,491 --> 01:26:38,356
Fuck.

904
01:26:41,529 --> 01:26:43,360
Danny.

905
01:26:45,800 --> 01:26:47,995
-My name is Tom.
-God!

906
01:26:48,203 --> 01:26:50,535
-Tom Van Allen.
-Jesus!

907
01:26:50,738 --> 01:26:54,640
Jesus! Okay, okay.

908
01:26:54,809 --> 01:26:57,937
Whatever you say. Whatever you say.

909
01:26:59,113 --> 01:27:02,879
What are you doing? Come on.
Look at me and talk to me.

910
01:27:03,051 --> 01:27:06,953
You're lost. The Salton Sea.

911
01:27:08,389 --> 01:27:13,417
You're in a bathroom.
You're shot in the shoulder.

912
01:27:14,529 --> 01:27:20,195
Your wife is about to be murdered
by two thieves with ski masks on.

913
01:27:20,368 --> 01:27:21,665
Jesus.

914
01:27:21,836 --> 01:27:27,638
Do you crawl out and die with her?
Do you stay? What do you do?

915
01:27:27,809 --> 01:27:29,299
I don't know.

916
01:27:31,813 --> 01:27:36,307
-Answer the question.
-Oh, God!

917
01:27:36,718 --> 01:27:39,152
-Answer the question.
-I don't know!

918
01:27:39,320 --> 01:27:42,187
-What do you do?
-Jesus.

919
01:27:42,890 --> 01:27:44,824
Do you die?

920
01:27:45,893 --> 01:27:47,986
Or do you fight?

921
01:27:48,930 --> 01:27:53,663
I couldn't have known.
I couldn't have known.

922
01:27:53,868 --> 01:27:59,363
God. I don't know what you want me
to say. I just couldn't have known.

923
01:28:02,110 --> 01:28:04,169
Tell me.

924
01:28:07,749 --> 01:28:09,683
I would....

925
01:28:11,319 --> 01:28:13,116
Please don't do this.

926
01:28:13,921 --> 01:28:18,017
-I'm sorry.
-She was so precious.

927
01:28:18,359 --> 01:28:21,260
-You shouldn't have killed her.
-I'm sorry.

928
01:28:21,462 --> 01:28:25,364
-You shouldn't have done that.
-I didn't know.

929
01:28:30,772 --> 01:28:36,142
You shouldn't have done that.
What do you do?

930
01:28:50,558 --> 01:28:53,254
Does that answer your question?

931
01:28:54,395 --> 01:28:56,192
I fight.

932
01:28:57,565 --> 01:29:01,501
I fight. And I die like a man.

933
01:29:02,070 --> 01:29:07,372
You. You've lived your life
like a punk.

934
01:29:09,043 --> 01:29:10,840
You're a coward.

935
01:29:11,713 --> 01:29:15,706
And now you're going
to die like one, huh?

936
01:29:15,917 --> 01:29:18,852
-Smith .357.
-Rubber combat-style grips.

937
01:29:19,053 --> 01:29:22,250
Fixed rear, ramp front sights,
two-inch barrel.

938
01:29:22,457 --> 01:29:26,188
Weighs a feather 21 oz.
Eight-round capacity.

939
01:29:33,067 --> 01:29:34,466
Or did I say nine?

940
01:29:36,204 --> 01:29:38,900
Which one is it, mister?
Eight or nine?

941
01:29:39,073 --> 01:29:42,600
It's a pretty big fucking difference
if you ask me.

942
01:29:43,211 --> 01:29:44,940
It doesn't matter.

943
01:29:46,814 --> 01:29:50,011
-What?
-It doesn't matter.

944
01:29:50,885 --> 01:29:54,651
It doesn't matter. It's too late.

945
01:29:58,092 --> 01:29:59,650
Eight.

946
01:32:14,128 --> 01:32:16,926
My name is Tom Van Allen.

947
01:32:17,131 --> 01:32:19,691
I'm a trumpet player.

948
01:32:20,535 --> 01:32:26,405
No. Your name is Danny Parker.
You're a motherfucking rat.

949
01:32:26,574 --> 01:32:28,508
No!

950
01:32:33,714 --> 01:32:37,115
-What's happening?
-I'll tell you what's happening.

951
01:32:37,318 --> 01:32:40,549
The fucking cops came.
They didn't find shit.

952
01:32:40,755 --> 01:32:44,213
Their fucking rat gave them
the wrong information.

953
01:32:44,392 --> 01:32:47,884
Fuck with the Mexicali boys,
that's what you get.

954
01:32:48,095 --> 01:32:52,623
Domingo figured you were the one
that ratted on him. Guess what?

955
01:32:52,833 --> 01:32:56,269
I brought a fucking rat of my own.

956
01:33:03,578 --> 01:33:04,943
You set me up?

957
01:33:05,112 --> 01:33:09,515
Man, that fucking bitch played you
like a squeezebox, Romeo.

958
01:33:10,284 --> 01:33:14,687
-They've got my daughter.
-She had no fucking choice, man.

959
01:33:15,389 --> 01:33:20,622
She took a good beating for you. I've
seen men crack after half of that.

960
01:33:20,828 --> 01:33:24,457
-I'm so sorry.
-One tough bitch you got there, huh?

961
01:33:24,665 --> 01:33:27,998
-It's okay.
-I'm so sorry.

962
01:33:28,436 --> 01:33:31,837
It's okay. It's okay.

963
01:33:35,076 --> 01:33:37,203
Let's go.

964
01:33:38,679 --> 01:33:42,843
-I'm so sorry. I'm sorry.
-Now!

965
01:33:43,818 --> 01:33:46,719
Let him burn, bitch.

966
01:34:23,190 --> 01:34:25,658
So who am I?

967
01:34:25,860 --> 01:34:29,762
Who am I after all is said and done?

968
01:34:29,964 --> 01:34:33,593
Tom Van Allen or Danny Parker?

969
01:34:34,535 --> 01:34:38,335
Avenging angel or plain old Judas?

970
01:34:39,573 --> 01:34:41,803
I don't know.

971
01:34:42,510 --> 01:34:44,876
You decide.

972
01:34:45,846 --> 01:34:48,337
I'm too tired.

973
01:34:49,850 --> 01:34:52,375
You decide.

974
01:35:01,462 --> 01:35:04,488
Oh, shit, what is this?

975
01:35:06,100 --> 01:35:08,193
Am I dead?

976
01:35:10,871 --> 01:35:13,066
Linoleum?

977
01:35:13,574 --> 01:35:15,769
This must be hell.

978
01:35:17,578 --> 01:35:20,877
Oh, no, what a clich.

979
01:36:01,455 --> 01:36:06,791
I've had some time to think about it
and it's pretty simple after all.

980
01:36:07,228 --> 01:36:12,689
I think it's like the man said,
"Man is the measure of all things. "

981
01:36:12,900 --> 01:36:16,097
I should know. I ran the gamut.

982
01:36:16,637 --> 01:36:21,336
Tom Van Allen got his revenge.
Good for Tom.

983
01:36:21,542 --> 01:36:26,206
And Danny Parker? He got gut-shot
for being a lowlife rat.

984
01:36:26,413 --> 01:36:28,643
That sucks for him.

985
01:36:29,016 --> 01:36:33,146
As far as I'm concerned,
they're both dead.

986
01:36:34,421 --> 01:36:36,787
So who is this guy?

987
01:36:37,191 --> 01:36:40,683
Tell you the truth,
I still don't know.

988
01:36:41,896 --> 01:36:44,763
But I like his chances.

989
01:36:47,868 --> 01:36:50,735
I really like his chances.
