1
00:00:39,639 --> 00:00:41,526
Help me.

2
00:00:54,119 --> 00:00:55,921
Oh, God.

3
00:01:00,459 --> 00:01:02,380
Help me!

4
00:01:03,362 --> 00:01:05,183
Please...

5
00:01:05,664 --> 00:01:07,586
Help me.

6
00:01:10,135 --> 00:01:11,990
Please.

7
00:01:12,805 --> 00:01:14,593
Help me.

8
00:02:02,455 --> 00:02:06,011
It's supposed to be playing sport,
fucking faggot!

9
00:02:19,371 --> 00:02:21,859
You broke the TV again.

10
00:02:22,408 --> 00:02:23,609
What're you talking about?

11
00:02:23,709 --> 00:02:28,033
You plugged all this wires and shit
into it. Now there's no picture.

12
00:02:28,848 --> 00:02:31,235
You fucking drunk.

13
00:02:32,351 --> 00:02:34,486
- What did you say to me?
- You heard me.

14
00:02:34,586 --> 00:02:38,174
What did you say to me?
Say it again! Say it again!

15
00:02:38,324 --> 00:02:42,230
You're a big tough guy, now? Say it.

16
00:02:44,730 --> 00:02:47,152
I'll fix it when I get back.

17
00:02:48,768 --> 00:02:51,289
Yeah, you'll fix it.

18
00:03:43,522 --> 00:03:46,726
Too scared to eat in the cafeteria
with everybody else?

19
00:03:46,826 --> 00:03:48,728
I'm not scared.

20
00:03:48,828 --> 00:03:51,380
Then why are you out here
doodling like a little girl?

21
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:52,732
What did I ever do to you?

22
00:03:52,832 --> 00:03:57,322
You came to this school and acted
like a fag, you fucking freak.

23
00:03:58,838 --> 00:04:00,791
Get outta my way.

24
00:04:01,139 --> 00:04:05,296
Oh, man, you came all over yourself!

25
00:04:06,629 --> 00:04:09,731
Is it because you're so excited
to see me, fag tag?

26
00:04:14,637 --> 00:04:16,158
You gonna clean up that mess?

27
00:04:17,990 --> 00:04:19,797
Are you crying?

28
00:04:21,627 --> 00:04:25,202
What do they say?
No crying over spilled milk?

29
00:04:25,631 --> 00:04:28,000
Come on, fag tag, lick it up.

30
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:30,002
You getting this?

31
00:04:30,302 --> 00:04:32,509
Leave me alone!

32
00:04:33,972 --> 00:04:35,680
I'll fucking kill you!

33
00:06:02,726 --> 00:06:04,768
Here you go.

34
00:06:08,968 --> 00:06:11,070
50 bucks for each criminal mastermind.

35
00:06:11,170 --> 00:06:15,574
Oh, come on. They're not bad kids,
they're just a little lost.

36
00:06:15,674 --> 00:06:20,283
- Now they're found.
- Well, they will be, once they meet him.

37
00:06:20,712 --> 00:06:25,122
- You don't get out too much, do you, Krauss?
- Mister Iverson needs me here.

38
00:06:25,451 --> 00:06:27,006
At the school.

39
00:06:27,106 --> 00:06:30,127
Bye now, have a blessed day!

40
00:06:36,561 --> 00:06:41,487
For those of you joining our program
this semester, welcome.

41
00:06:41,867 --> 00:06:47,010
I designed Mind's Eye Academy
as a place to reset.

42
00:06:48,039 --> 00:06:52,349
A place to learn
how to do things differently.

43
00:06:54,279 --> 00:06:57,049
We attune ourselves to the desert.

44
00:06:57,149 --> 00:07:00,758
To the Earth, and to the sky.

45
00:07:02,755 --> 00:07:05,390
Giving your cell phones to Christine

46
00:07:05,490 --> 00:07:08,165
frees you up to other communications.

47
00:07:10,963 --> 00:07:13,501
We work with our hands...

48
00:07:13,601 --> 00:07:14,958
as well as our minds.

49
00:07:15,058 --> 00:07:16,787
There's no service here, anyways.

50
00:07:17,287 --> 00:07:21,503
- It's got all my music.
- No exceptions.

51
00:07:22,607 --> 00:07:25,983
But if you think of it
as part of a larger process,

52
00:07:26,645 --> 00:07:28,651
then it just might.

53
00:07:34,686 --> 00:07:39,094
You've come here to destroy
the impulses that got you here.

54
00:08:05,717 --> 00:08:07,892
I've seen worse.

55
00:08:08,921 --> 00:08:10,890
The place is a fucking scam.

56
00:08:11,490 --> 00:08:15,360
Yeah, see that Mercedes in the lot?

57
00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:17,796
We could hotwire it, take it to Vegas.

58
00:08:17,896 --> 00:08:21,867
Yeah, why not? They can pin some
more bullshit crimes on us, right?

59
00:08:22,167 --> 00:08:26,043
Okay, hold on. My crime
was not bullshit, all right?

60
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:31,617
- Porn hack.
- What?

61
00:08:31,717 --> 00:08:36,181
I... rerouted my school servers
to Bangtastic.com. I'm sure you know it.

62
00:08:36,281 --> 00:08:40,219
You know, everyone googling Selena Gomez,
or Bieber, or whoever the fuck, you know.

63
00:08:40,319 --> 00:08:43,827
Bang! Big cocks. Wide open pussies.

64
00:08:44,923 --> 00:08:47,492
How much of a hero are you?

65
00:08:47,592 --> 00:08:51,834
I was number one thug for about a day.
So what about you?

66
00:08:52,965 --> 00:08:55,973
Come on, man, we're all fuckups here.

67
00:08:57,636 --> 00:09:01,599
This kid was picking on me for years.

68
00:09:02,457 --> 00:09:04,765
I finally hit him back.

69
00:09:05,076 --> 00:09:06,945
They blamed it on me.

70
00:09:07,545 --> 00:09:10,049
Fucking bullies always
get away with their shit.

71
00:09:10,149 --> 00:09:12,885
I wanna live in a world where...

72
00:09:12,985 --> 00:09:15,393
where assholes get
what they deserve, you know?

73
00:09:16,888 --> 00:09:19,730
Well, you must have clocked
the shit outta that dude.

74
00:09:43,282 --> 00:09:46,421
Come on, man. It ain't so bad.

75
00:09:46,621 --> 00:09:51,189
We're surrounded by beautiful sunsets
and emotionally annihilated girls.

76
00:09:51,289 --> 00:09:54,593
Yeah, I could get into
sitting on the porch

77
00:09:54,693 --> 00:09:57,916
with a shotgun, dropping acid.

78
00:09:58,096 --> 00:10:01,538
Firing at invisible machine elves.

79
00:10:06,437 --> 00:10:09,212
Jesus, no means no, guy.

80
00:10:26,491 --> 00:10:28,532
Eating alone?

81
00:10:29,694 --> 00:10:31,535
No.

82
00:10:33,532 --> 00:10:36,819
- I heard about you.
- Is that a good thing?

83
00:10:36,919 --> 00:10:38,726
Pretty good.

84
00:10:43,342 --> 00:10:46,278
- What was that about?
- Oh, he's just asking about you.

85
00:10:46,378 --> 00:10:49,749
- What's with all the attention?
- Come on,

86
00:10:49,849 --> 00:10:51,922
you like it.

87
00:10:53,986 --> 00:10:56,126
Nice.

88
00:10:57,522 --> 00:11:01,565
- Seriously, what was that about?
- I don't know, forget about it.

89
00:11:18,677 --> 00:11:21,647
Samantha. Tell us why you're here.

90
00:11:21,747 --> 00:11:24,183
Because my parents are fucking retarded.

91
00:11:24,283 --> 00:11:28,019
- Let's not blame others.
- Because I was selling pills.

92
00:11:28,119 --> 00:11:32,187
I wanted to be captain of the soccer team,
my parents expected straight As.

93
00:11:32,287 --> 00:11:34,379
But with Adderall I could do everything.

94
00:11:34,659 --> 00:11:37,967
- So what's the problem?
- Kaitlin...

95
00:11:38,396 --> 00:11:40,999
<i>Your mind is everything,
what you think, you become.</i>

96
00:11:41,099 --> 00:11:44,038
<i>Do not dwell on the past,
do not dream of the future.</i>

97
00:11:44,138 --> 00:11:46,104
<i>Concentrate the mind
on the present moment.</i>

98
00:11:46,204 --> 00:11:47,273
Hey.

99
00:11:47,373 --> 00:11:51,310
- She makes me desperate for a cigarette.
- Have you seen our teacher?

100
00:11:51,410 --> 00:11:53,984
And try to run the down and up.

101
00:11:54,246 --> 00:11:56,615
And back into downward dog.

102
00:11:56,715 --> 00:11:59,801
The desire to be perfect?
The trick of the ego.

103
00:12:00,251 --> 00:12:03,489
Screw that.
Everybody wants to be perfect.

104
00:12:03,689 --> 00:12:05,590
He's not saying everyone
doesn't wanna be perfect,

105
00:12:05,690 --> 00:12:08,327
he's just saying that wanting
doesn't get you very far.

106
00:12:08,427 --> 00:12:10,835
Very helpful, Willie, thank you.

107
00:12:12,901 --> 00:12:14,966
May seem crazy to you guys.

108
00:12:15,066 --> 00:12:18,270
Trust me, it did to me, too
when I used to go here.

109
00:12:18,370 --> 00:12:19,888
Keep your spine aligned.

110
00:12:19,988 --> 00:12:21,774
- Lincoln?
- What?

111
00:12:21,874 --> 00:12:23,558
Would you like to tell us
why you're here?

112
00:12:23,708 --> 00:12:25,516
No.

113
00:12:26,345 --> 00:12:28,098
I don't deserve to be here.

114
00:12:52,670 --> 00:12:54,844
Let's go, man.

115
00:12:55,374 --> 00:12:57,248
I'm good.

116
00:13:32,177 --> 00:13:34,842
I thought you were pretty badass.

117
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:39,390
I mean, stabbing somebody in the face
with a fork? That's pretty gangster.

118
00:13:40,836 --> 00:13:42,638
He got what he deserved.

119
00:13:43,388 --> 00:13:46,596
Yeah, well, we don't need
to pull vigilante shit here, right?

120
00:13:47,058 --> 00:13:49,332
I'm cool with that.

121
00:13:50,695 --> 00:13:52,603
You're cool with that?

122
00:13:57,102 --> 00:13:59,309
Fucking cool with that?

123
00:14:00,438 --> 00:14:02,695
Isn't that fucking groovy?

124
00:14:37,442 --> 00:14:40,103
It's because of you, isn't it?
You're going around telling people

125
00:14:40,203 --> 00:14:42,881
that I'm some freak that stabbed
someone with a fork.

126
00:14:42,981 --> 00:14:44,482
No, I'm not.

127
00:14:44,582 --> 00:14:47,758
At least have the balls
to admit it, Isaac.

128
00:14:49,821 --> 00:14:53,625
- All right, man, but it's badass.
- No, it's not.

129
00:14:53,725 --> 00:14:58,830
Because now people are gonna test me
to see if I lose my shit.

130
00:14:58,930 --> 00:15:02,333
No. They'll think you're a stone cold killer
and leave you the fuck alone.

131
00:15:02,433 --> 00:15:04,636
Not how it works, Isaac.

132
00:15:04,736 --> 00:15:09,095
Jesus, all right, I'm just trying to help.
Why don't you fucking stick up for yourself?

133
00:16:23,215 --> 00:16:27,664
What we've got here
is a failure to communicate.

134
00:16:32,891 --> 00:16:36,794
Look, I'm just fucking with you.
I mean, seriously, how cliché is this?

135
00:16:36,894 --> 00:16:41,043
The bully picking on the spazzy kid,
trying to get him to freak out?

136
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:44,641
Glad you came around.

137
00:16:55,913 --> 00:16:58,369
I just wanna skip to the part
where you freak out.

138
00:17:01,486 --> 00:17:04,623
Oops. Guess I'm the spazz.

139
00:17:05,123 --> 00:17:06,808
Nasty.

140
00:17:06,908 --> 00:17:08,982
You actually talk?

141
00:17:11,429 --> 00:17:13,504
I thought you'd just have him
do it for you.

142
00:17:14,933 --> 00:17:16,806
Pick it up.

143
00:17:19,871 --> 00:17:21,711
No.

144
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:24,144
Pick it the fuck up.

145
00:17:47,832 --> 00:17:49,373
Good job, shitheads.

146
00:17:55,273 --> 00:17:57,314
Oh, fuck.

147
00:18:00,612 --> 00:18:01,952
Fuck.

148
00:18:36,347 --> 00:18:38,288
Nice lighter.

149
00:18:39,083 --> 00:18:40,757
Thanks.

150
00:18:42,370 --> 00:18:44,266
It was my mom's.

151
00:18:51,029 --> 00:18:53,569
I think it's cool, you know.

152
00:18:54,399 --> 00:18:57,207
What you did to that kid
to get sent here.

153
00:18:58,704 --> 00:19:00,643
I feel bad.

154
00:19:02,807 --> 00:19:05,249
People get what they deserve.

155
00:19:05,661 --> 00:19:07,800
Or they should.

156
00:19:08,313 --> 00:19:10,253
I hate bullies.

157
00:19:17,855 --> 00:19:21,998
- What'd you do to get here?
- Usual bad girl stuff.

158
00:19:23,094 --> 00:19:25,735
The wayward cheerleader.

159
00:19:26,330 --> 00:19:29,530
- You're a cheerleader?
- Past life.

160
00:19:31,035 --> 00:19:33,995
I think it's starting to happen again...

161
00:19:34,595 --> 00:19:36,303
with Willie.

162
00:19:37,475 --> 00:19:39,527
I don't wanna fight him.

163
00:19:39,627 --> 00:19:41,923
But he keeps testing me.

164
00:19:43,699 --> 00:19:45,505
I can help.

165
00:19:50,488 --> 00:19:51,957
What are you gonna do?

166
00:19:58,630 --> 00:20:00,870
I'll kick his ass.

167
00:20:02,050 --> 00:20:04,186
You'll get us both killed.

168
00:20:05,703 --> 00:20:07,844
Here's hoping.

169
00:20:20,785 --> 00:20:22,821
- Wait, do it again.
- Do it again. Do it again.

170
00:20:22,921 --> 00:20:25,523
Just say that. Don't fuck up. Yeah.

171
00:20:25,623 --> 00:20:27,159
- "Tippin' on my dick"?
- That shit...

172
00:20:27,259 --> 00:20:32,388
<i>I'm in the party with my jeans to a sag
If a girl wanna dance then she gotta be bad</i>

173
00:20:32,488 --> 00:20:34,366
<i>Tippin' on my dick
Tip, tippin' on my dick</i>

174
00:20:34,466 --> 00:20:38,169
I like any song that's about anybody
licking my clit. This is a good song.

175
00:20:38,269 --> 00:20:40,819
<i>I'm tasty, yeah, I'm a cold ass bitch</i>

176
00:20:40,919 --> 00:20:43,023
<i>I gotta be specifically
in this piece of shit</i>

177
00:20:43,123 --> 00:20:45,476
<i>So fuck you literally
and come and get my shit</i>

178
00:20:45,576 --> 00:20:47,445
- Oh, shit.
- What happens next?

179
00:20:47,545 --> 00:20:49,085
Oh, shit.

180
00:21:28,852 --> 00:21:30,727
What's this?

181
00:21:35,527 --> 00:21:36,934
Fuck you, Iverson.

182
00:21:53,244 --> 00:21:56,181
- You scared the shit out of me.
- I'm sorry.

183
00:21:56,281 --> 00:21:58,388
Walls are super thin.

184
00:21:59,584 --> 00:22:01,219
What are they gonna do?

185
00:22:01,319 --> 00:22:04,726
Put us in a reform school
in the middle of the desert?

186
00:22:05,306 --> 00:22:08,161
Or else they'll meditate us to death.

187
00:22:09,093 --> 00:22:11,434
I brought you something.

188
00:22:12,313 --> 00:22:14,116
I made a playlist for you.

189
00:22:14,566 --> 00:22:16,501
Where'd you hide this?

190
00:22:16,601 --> 00:22:20,790
I found where they stashed them,
and I took it back.

191
00:22:21,205 --> 00:22:24,943
- Fuck them, it's mine.
- Awesome.

192
00:22:25,143 --> 00:22:26,883
Thanks.

193
00:22:28,746 --> 00:22:31,750
I know you're a cheerleader,
or whatever.

194
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:35,186
Maybe you won't like this music, but...

195
00:23:02,046 --> 00:23:04,287
That's awesome.

196
00:23:07,585 --> 00:23:10,473
It saved me so many times.

197
00:23:10,955 --> 00:23:14,463
Have you ever had the feeling,
when your whole body's saying...

198
00:23:15,292 --> 00:23:18,067
you wanna punch your head
through the wall?

199
00:23:18,429 --> 00:23:20,042
This...

200
00:23:20,142 --> 00:23:23,294
makes me feel
like I'm driving a tank and...

201
00:23:23,394 --> 00:23:27,205
rolling over piles of skulls
and blasting mortar shells

202
00:23:27,305 --> 00:23:30,584
through everybody that pissed me off.

203
00:23:31,275 --> 00:23:33,745
I mean, you go through
this whole experience

204
00:23:33,845 --> 00:23:38,514
of anger and fighting and hatred.

205
00:23:38,749 --> 00:23:40,990
And when the song's over,

206
00:23:41,819 --> 00:23:44,661
I don't feel like putting my head
through a wall.

207
00:23:45,689 --> 00:23:48,031
For just that one minute.

208
00:23:50,027 --> 00:23:51,969
I know exactly that feeling.

209
00:23:54,565 --> 00:23:56,273
Do...

210
00:24:08,579 --> 00:24:10,782
You need to fight him.

211
00:24:10,882 --> 00:24:12,083
What?

212
00:24:12,183 --> 00:24:13,919
Willie.

213
00:24:14,519 --> 00:24:17,355
If you don't take him down early,
he will eat you alive.

214
00:24:17,455 --> 00:24:20,258
Kaitlin, this is the exact reason
why I'm here.

215
00:24:20,358 --> 00:24:23,661
Do it in front of his friends.
He won't squeal.

216
00:24:23,761 --> 00:24:26,310
Hit him once and he'll crumble.

217
00:24:27,615 --> 00:24:30,685
Show him that skull-crushing tank,
and he'll find somebody else to fuck with.

218
00:24:31,135 --> 00:24:33,838
I don't think that's a good idea.

219
00:24:33,938 --> 00:24:36,779
Don't think, Lincoln.

220
00:24:40,211 --> 00:24:43,650
I should... I should get back
to my room.

221
00:25:53,011 --> 00:25:55,253
- Where you going, man?
- I'm afraid I forgot...

222
00:25:55,353 --> 00:25:57,556
You look like take a shower.
Don't let me stop you.

223
00:25:57,656 --> 00:25:58,887
It's okay.

224
00:25:58,987 --> 00:26:01,225
Clean yourself off
for that hot snatch of yours.

225
00:26:01,325 --> 00:26:04,711
- She does like it dirty, trust me, I know.
- She figure out you're a faggot?

226
00:26:05,829 --> 00:26:08,037
You guys are pathetic.

227
00:26:11,369 --> 00:26:15,328
- Get the fuck off me!
- Always the hard way with you.

228
00:26:16,974 --> 00:26:20,344
- I'll fucking kill you!
- What, a little spanking?

229
00:26:20,444 --> 00:26:22,886
- This is messed up, man, let's forget it.
- Shut up.

230
00:26:25,649 --> 00:26:28,205
She's gonna love this.

231
00:26:46,738 --> 00:26:48,811
You hit me.

232
00:26:59,117 --> 00:27:01,206
No, let's quit.

233
00:27:32,650 --> 00:27:34,757
I wish they were all dead.

234
00:27:38,155 --> 00:27:41,798
I wish they were all dead.
I wish they were all dead.

235
00:27:42,793 --> 00:27:45,101
I wish they were all dead!

236
00:27:47,098 --> 00:27:48,738
Lincoln...

237
00:27:52,870 --> 00:27:54,638
I'll kill them all.

238
00:27:57,208 --> 00:28:00,130
We'll kill them all together.

239
00:28:35,513 --> 00:28:38,249
- I gotta go.
- Oh, yeah?

240
00:28:38,349 --> 00:28:41,290
When did you learn
to act like such a man?

241
00:28:45,656 --> 00:28:47,931
It obviously wasn't
from those high school girls.

242
00:28:50,928 --> 00:28:53,064
I bet they didn't even know
what to do with you.

243
00:28:53,164 --> 00:28:55,609
I guess it just comes naturally.

244
00:28:59,370 --> 00:29:02,215
I'm gonna kill that fucking kid.

245
00:29:06,477 --> 00:29:08,579
So fucking weak, I can see it.

246
00:29:08,679 --> 00:29:11,571
He doesn't look so weak to me.
Popped you pretty good.

247
00:29:11,871 --> 00:29:14,085
He got it worse, trust me.

248
00:29:14,185 --> 00:29:15,692
Be careful, Willie.

249
00:30:17,315 --> 00:30:20,657
Please... please help me.

250
00:30:22,787 --> 00:30:24,894
Who the fuck is that?

251
00:30:55,353 --> 00:30:58,695
Help me, Willie, please.

252
00:31:01,458 --> 00:31:03,699
You're gonna die.

253
00:32:09,226 --> 00:32:11,600
Wake up, Kaitlin!

254
00:32:14,332 --> 00:32:17,512
- Come on, you're on cleanup duty.
- I'm coming.

255
00:32:19,270 --> 00:32:21,831
Oh, fuck.

256
00:33:41,484 --> 00:33:43,892
I don't believe this.

257
00:33:44,521 --> 00:33:47,997
I was just playing ball with him
a few hours before.

258
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:52,563
The divide between the self
we present to the world

259
00:33:52,963 --> 00:33:56,572
- and our true inner self...
- No, fuck that.

260
00:33:56,934 --> 00:34:00,838
No, Willie wasn't hiding this.
I knew him better than any of you.

261
00:34:00,938 --> 00:34:03,540
He never would've...

262
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:06,478
Never would've done this shit.

263
00:34:06,844 --> 00:34:08,818
It's truly very sad.

264
00:34:09,180 --> 00:34:12,545
But let's not allow sadness and grief

265
00:34:12,645 --> 00:34:15,686
turn to anger and negativity.

266
00:34:15,786 --> 00:34:19,489
Just remember that Willie was a young man
who'd shown in his time here

267
00:34:19,589 --> 00:34:21,452
remarkable spiritual growth.

268
00:34:58,462 --> 00:35:00,731
You all right there, partner?

269
00:35:00,831 --> 00:35:02,782
Yeah, it's just a shock, you know?

270
00:35:04,301 --> 00:35:06,403
He was a good kid?

271
00:35:06,503 --> 00:35:08,410
Not really.

272
00:35:10,842 --> 00:35:13,824
You know, it's a... hour drive...

273
00:35:14,044 --> 00:35:16,886
every time I gotta come
pick up a dead kid.

274
00:35:17,714 --> 00:35:19,587
Each way.

275
00:35:20,450 --> 00:35:22,940
I mean, these fuckups
gotta quit killing themselves.

276
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:25,623
Or else things will get difficult
for y'all out here.

277
00:35:25,723 --> 00:35:27,229
I understand.

278
00:35:28,091 --> 00:35:30,376
Well, I hope that you do.

279
00:35:31,228 --> 00:35:33,698
'Cause I can only keep the wolves
from the door for so long.

280
00:35:43,241 --> 00:35:45,714
There was blood everywhere.

281
00:35:46,110 --> 00:35:47,220
I mean...

282
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:51,559
I've seen people cut themselves,
or whatever, but this...

283
00:35:52,082 --> 00:35:54,426
Willie must've been out of his mind.

284
00:35:55,653 --> 00:35:57,914
Maybe he was Borderline Personality.

285
00:35:58,889 --> 00:36:02,662
Maybe he hated himself as much
as he hated everybody else.

286
00:36:04,027 --> 00:36:06,864
Maybe all the filth and nastiness
just came pouring out of him at once

287
00:36:06,964 --> 00:36:09,739
and he slit his own fucking throat,
I don't know.

288
00:36:16,924 --> 00:36:18,311
Look.

289
00:36:23,548 --> 00:36:25,004
Shit.

290
00:36:25,649 --> 00:36:28,023
Oh, fuck.

291
00:36:30,888 --> 00:36:32,556
Hey.

292
00:36:32,656 --> 00:36:35,881
- Are you okay?
- Why wouldn't I be?

293
00:36:36,459 --> 00:36:38,834
This isn't a tragedy.

294
00:36:39,363 --> 00:36:41,570
I don't know, it's weird.

295
00:36:42,466 --> 00:36:44,773
I feel responsible.

296
00:36:45,903 --> 00:36:48,214
Like I made this happen.

297
00:36:49,206 --> 00:36:51,758
Willie'd love to hurt you.

298
00:36:53,043 --> 00:36:55,508
You should be high-fiving God,
right now.

299
00:36:57,148 --> 00:36:59,121
You're free.

300
00:37:00,618 --> 00:37:03,188
That's the freakiest thing
I've ever seen.

301
00:37:03,921 --> 00:37:06,523
Why would he do that to himself?

302
00:37:06,623 --> 00:37:08,553
Maybe...

303
00:37:08,853 --> 00:37:11,977
someone carved that
into his skin, and then...

304
00:37:12,077 --> 00:37:14,000
murdered him.

305
00:37:15,098 --> 00:37:16,967
I don't know.

306
00:37:17,067 --> 00:37:19,274
Who would do that?

307
00:37:47,447 --> 00:37:50,461
They'll never fuck with us again.

308
00:37:56,757 --> 00:37:58,304
Hey.

309
00:37:59,576 --> 00:38:01,369
Iverson wants to see you.

310
00:38:02,579 --> 00:38:06,655
- Why?
- What's it matter why? Come on.

311
00:38:09,619 --> 00:38:12,957
Look at me. Hey, look at me. You high?

312
00:38:13,557 --> 00:38:15,559
Did you get in a fight?

313
00:38:15,659 --> 00:38:18,600
- What?
- Your cheek.

314
00:38:20,097 --> 00:38:22,137
Basketball.

315
00:38:23,667 --> 00:38:25,708
You and Willie didn't get along.

316
00:38:26,903 --> 00:38:28,939
We weren't friends.

317
00:38:29,039 --> 00:38:33,468
Come on, Lincoln.
You're not in trouble. Talk to me.

318
00:38:36,213 --> 00:38:39,087
No, we didn't... we didn't get along.

319
00:38:39,382 --> 00:38:41,517
It's a mystery to me.

320
00:38:41,617 --> 00:38:44,631
Why some kids decide
to pick on other kids.

321
00:38:44,855 --> 00:38:48,759
I'm sure Willie could answer that
for you better than I can.

322
00:38:48,859 --> 00:38:52,118
How does that make you feel?
That Willie's dead.

323
00:38:54,664 --> 00:38:56,405
I...

324
00:38:57,234 --> 00:39:00,642
- I feel bad for his family.
- But relieved.

325
00:39:01,538 --> 00:39:02,973
I didn't say that.

326
00:39:03,073 --> 00:39:05,642
You can be honest.
There's a part of you.

327
00:39:05,742 --> 00:39:08,211
Maybe just a really small part.

328
00:39:08,311 --> 00:39:11,820
- A part that's happy that Willie's dead.
- Shut the fuck up!

329
00:39:26,046 --> 00:39:28,120
What is it?

330
00:39:32,269 --> 00:39:34,609
I feel like...

331
00:39:35,559 --> 00:39:37,970
something's out there.

332
00:39:38,475 --> 00:39:40,649
It's called guilt.

333
00:39:41,445 --> 00:39:44,019
Why would I feel guilty?

334
00:39:45,214 --> 00:39:47,351
'Cause you killed Willie.

335
00:39:47,451 --> 00:39:51,887
- With your mind.
- I didn't kill him.

336
00:39:51,987 --> 00:39:53,906
Jeez...

337
00:39:54,006 --> 00:39:56,385
you are stressed.

338
00:40:16,713 --> 00:40:19,229
- You know the other night?
- Yeah?

339
00:40:19,783 --> 00:40:22,024
I felt these.

340
00:40:23,587 --> 00:40:26,611
Those are from my bad girl phase.

341
00:40:26,957 --> 00:40:29,741
Right above my cheerleader skirt.

342
00:40:30,493 --> 00:40:32,528
You're a cutter?

343
00:40:33,232 --> 00:40:34,736
I was.

344
00:40:35,298 --> 00:40:38,149
I was really hurting at the time, and...

345
00:40:38,535 --> 00:40:43,317
cutting made the pain feel
like it's... under my control.

346
00:40:50,447 --> 00:40:53,155
It's my version of death metal.

347
00:42:56,523 --> 00:42:58,463
What do you want from me?

348
00:42:59,309 --> 00:43:01,683
What do you want from me?

349
00:43:04,113 --> 00:43:06,426
What do you want from me?

350
00:43:06,526 --> 00:43:08,590
Answer me!

351
00:43:20,396 --> 00:43:21,803
I could wipe you out.

352
00:43:23,199 --> 00:43:25,440
With my mind.

353
00:43:25,835 --> 00:43:27,632
So don't fuck with me.

354
00:43:33,910 --> 00:43:35,684
Fuck!

355
00:44:16,353 --> 00:44:18,597
Do you know whose blood this is?

356
00:44:25,295 --> 00:44:27,535
Do you miss him?

357
00:45:03,132 --> 00:45:07,775
I'll kill you! You hear me,
I'll fucking kill you!

358
00:45:08,738 --> 00:45:11,179
Get the fuck out!

359
00:46:06,395 --> 00:46:08,970
You just do what they tell you, right?

360
00:46:09,832 --> 00:46:13,409
There's always one of you!
You fucking coward!

361
00:46:17,340 --> 00:46:20,677
Moira Karp was a student here.
She killed herself at the school.

362
00:46:20,777 --> 00:46:24,714
I also found this. The link is dead,
but the original's still on this hard drive.

363
00:46:24,814 --> 00:46:27,322
They made it right here in this room.

364
00:46:27,518 --> 00:46:30,721
- This is the page they took down.
- Who took it down?

365
00:46:30,821 --> 00:46:33,256
Probably Iverson
covered up this sick mess.

366
00:46:33,556 --> 00:46:36,626
"Moira Karp's food diary: Come.

367
00:46:37,026 --> 00:46:40,163
More come. Even more come."

368
00:46:40,263 --> 00:46:41,798
They hated this girl.

369
00:46:41,898 --> 00:46:44,840
This was years ago.
What does this have to do with Willie?

370
00:46:45,902 --> 00:46:47,505
I've seen her.

371
00:46:48,155 --> 00:46:49,928
Here.

372
00:46:50,307 --> 00:46:52,480
You all right, man?

373
00:46:56,379 --> 00:46:58,586
I have to warn them.

374
00:47:22,406 --> 00:47:23,912
Moira?

375
00:47:27,810 --> 00:47:29,737
Wanna try?

376
00:47:29,837 --> 00:47:31,577
Please...

377
00:47:31,677 --> 00:47:33,344
you have to stop this.

378
00:47:34,351 --> 00:47:35,952
But...

379
00:47:36,152 --> 00:47:38,526
This is what you wanted.

380
00:47:40,156 --> 00:47:41,800
Stop!

381
00:47:58,941 --> 00:48:02,984
I'm yours, Lincoln. And you're mine.

382
00:48:13,489 --> 00:48:15,863
Do you got a minute?

383
00:48:17,127 --> 00:48:18,752
Yeah.

384
00:48:20,062 --> 00:48:23,866
You were a student here, right?
Before you started teaching?

385
00:48:23,966 --> 00:48:27,491
- A few years ago, yeah.
- Maybe you can help me with something.

386
00:48:27,591 --> 00:48:30,907
I'm trying to find out about a girl
who used to go here.

387
00:48:31,007 --> 00:48:32,914
Moira Karp.

388
00:48:33,642 --> 00:48:35,417
Where did you hear of her?

389
00:48:36,580 --> 00:48:38,620
Just around.

390
00:48:39,149 --> 00:48:41,100
Did you know her?

391
00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:43,686
- I wish I hadn't.
- Why?

392
00:48:44,054 --> 00:48:46,189
Because she was evil.

393
00:48:46,289 --> 00:48:49,679
She was, Kaitlin.
You would've thought so, too.

394
00:48:49,779 --> 00:48:53,691
She lied all the time, she got
all of us girls in trouble. She just...

395
00:48:53,791 --> 00:48:57,605
she was crazy. Dangerous crazy.

396
00:48:58,450 --> 00:49:00,758
What happened to her?

397
00:49:03,673 --> 00:49:05,947
She killed herself.

398
00:49:06,926 --> 00:49:09,851
- Because of what the other girls did to her?
- Because she was sick.

399
00:49:11,547 --> 00:49:12,649
Christine!

400
00:49:12,749 --> 00:49:15,785
Everyone, find your inner peace.
Find your calm.

401
00:49:15,885 --> 00:49:18,729
Tend to your chores,
tend to your chores.

402
00:49:24,127 --> 00:49:26,067
What did you see?

403
00:49:29,298 --> 00:49:31,272
I don't know.

404
00:49:36,372 --> 00:49:38,513
We need to talk.

405
00:49:41,010 --> 00:49:43,079
Lincoln, what happened?

406
00:49:43,179 --> 00:49:46,220
- I saw her.
- Wait, you saw Moira?

407
00:49:46,849 --> 00:49:50,258
She killed Derek.
She cut him into fucking ribbons.

408
00:49:51,455 --> 00:49:53,389
You killed them.

409
00:49:53,489 --> 00:49:56,158
- Is that what you...
- No! Listen to me!

410
00:49:56,258 --> 00:49:59,200
- You can tell me the truth.
- I am!

411
00:50:00,196 --> 00:50:02,666
If you did this,
they got what they deserve.

412
00:50:02,766 --> 00:50:05,039
You stood up for yourself.

413
00:50:06,569 --> 00:50:08,040
How could you say that?

414
00:50:08,140 --> 00:50:11,728
It's payback, Lincoln.
Fucking bullies, they're all the same.

415
00:50:12,208 --> 00:50:16,395
What would you know? You're the hot,
popular girl that everyone likes.

416
00:50:16,495 --> 00:50:18,736
I know, okay?

417
00:50:19,015 --> 00:50:21,389
I know all about it.

418
00:50:24,720 --> 00:50:27,340
Nobody here knows this, but...

419
00:50:27,440 --> 00:50:29,614
There was a girl in my high school.

420
00:50:29,959 --> 00:50:32,733
She was my best friend growing up.

421
00:50:33,029 --> 00:50:37,071
And then she stole my boyfriend,
and I turned everybody against her.

422
00:50:38,501 --> 00:50:41,971
I spread a rumor that she had herpes,
I told her boyfriend, my ex,

423
00:50:42,071 --> 00:50:44,979
and I convinced him that she had lied.

424
00:50:45,975 --> 00:50:49,517
He was so pissed he gave me
a bunch of naked photos of her.

425
00:50:50,180 --> 00:50:53,103
And I texted them around the school.

426
00:50:53,850 --> 00:50:57,053
I just wanted to shame her, you know?
Put her in her place.

427
00:50:57,153 --> 00:50:59,456
I made her life hell.

428
00:50:59,556 --> 00:51:02,303
And it became like an addiction.

429
00:51:02,691 --> 00:51:05,795
I got a rush every time she cried.

430
00:51:05,895 --> 00:51:08,161
That's horrible.

431
00:51:10,166 --> 00:51:12,240
It gets worse.

432
00:51:13,269 --> 00:51:15,476
She killed herself.

433
00:51:19,075 --> 00:51:21,983
And I never expected it to go that far.

434
00:51:23,646 --> 00:51:27,755
You can imagine how terrible
I have felt every day since then.

435
00:51:32,355 --> 00:51:34,129
And...

436
00:51:35,191 --> 00:51:38,232
And that's why
I started things with you.

437
00:51:40,830 --> 00:51:43,199
I wanted to know
what it felt like to be a victim.

438
00:51:43,299 --> 00:51:46,574
I wanted to help somebody for once,
instead of hurting them.

439
00:51:48,771 --> 00:51:50,912
How could you?

440
00:51:53,109 --> 00:51:54,911
Was I...

441
00:51:55,311 --> 00:51:57,542
Was I just some freak...

442
00:51:57,942 --> 00:52:00,154
that you examined?

443
00:52:04,403 --> 00:52:07,490
- Why don't you...
- No, no, no, please, please...

444
00:52:07,590 --> 00:52:09,429
please that's how it started...

445
00:52:10,293 --> 00:52:12,729
Do you know how that makes me feel?

446
00:52:13,829 --> 00:52:15,631
I'm sorry.

447
00:52:15,731 --> 00:52:18,100
I have to stop Moira
before she kills someone else.

448
00:52:18,200 --> 00:52:21,476
You don't have to lie to me,
I'm on your side.

449
00:52:22,171 --> 00:52:24,412
Stay away.

450
00:54:02,839 --> 00:54:04,546
Moira?

451
00:54:10,346 --> 00:54:12,187
Moira!

452
00:54:16,386 --> 00:54:19,005
Lincoln! You came!

453
00:54:19,105 --> 00:54:22,741
- Moira, you have to stop.
- But they deserve it.

454
00:54:22,991 --> 00:54:27,246
- They don't deserve to die.
- You wanted them dead, you said it.

455
00:54:28,197 --> 00:54:30,237
I didn't know you existed.

456
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:35,617
You wanted it, Lincoln, I can feel it.
I can feel your anger, it brought me back!

457
00:54:35,837 --> 00:54:39,108
- I was just scared.
- We've both suffered alone.

458
00:54:39,208 --> 00:54:42,178
But now I can get all of them,
we can do it together, kill everybody.

459
00:54:42,278 --> 00:54:45,097
- Whoever fucked with us!
- Moira!

460
00:54:45,781 --> 00:54:48,451
You have to stop, please.

461
00:54:48,551 --> 00:54:51,989
- Don't say that!
- Just go away!

462
00:54:52,689 --> 00:54:55,324
- I don't need you anymore.
- Don't say that, please!

463
00:54:55,424 --> 00:54:59,800
- Don't be like the rest of them, please!
- I don't need you anymore!

464
00:55:07,821 --> 00:55:09,727
Moira!

465
00:55:43,289 --> 00:55:45,063
Moira?

466
00:55:48,544 --> 00:55:51,080
I can't help you no more, Jack.

467
00:55:51,180 --> 00:55:52,948
It's a copycat thing, okay?

468
00:55:53,048 --> 00:55:56,786
One kid decides to do it,
another kid decides to do it, too.

469
00:55:56,886 --> 00:55:58,787
I'll handle it.

470
00:55:58,887 --> 00:56:01,690
Enough of that crap.

471
00:56:01,790 --> 00:56:04,126
I've gotta call it in.

472
00:56:04,226 --> 00:56:06,895
Gotta send the kids home.

473
00:56:06,995 --> 00:56:09,403
Gotta shut it down, man.

474
00:56:09,798 --> 00:56:11,500
Can't do that.

475
00:56:11,600 --> 00:56:14,908
Some of these kids
come from real dangerous homes.

476
00:56:15,670 --> 00:56:18,446
There's nothing more dangerous
than this place.

477
00:56:20,142 --> 00:56:23,283
Look, you got until tomorrow morning...

478
00:56:23,746 --> 00:56:26,248
then I'm coming back, Jack.

479
00:56:26,348 --> 00:56:28,502
And I'm not coming alone.

480
00:56:28,602 --> 00:56:31,309
Kaitlin. Kaitlin.

481
00:56:31,754 --> 00:56:34,094
You're gonna get in trouble.

482
00:56:34,556 --> 00:56:36,797
Have you seen Kaitlin?

483
00:56:40,629 --> 00:56:42,871
What did it look like?

484
00:56:45,835 --> 00:56:48,191
I heard both his wrists were slashed.

485
00:56:52,208 --> 00:56:53,848
Leave me alone.

486
00:56:54,710 --> 00:56:56,351
I was just asking.

487
00:56:59,014 --> 00:57:00,488
Kaitlin.

488
00:57:41,924 --> 00:57:44,198
Did that hurt?

489
00:57:52,268 --> 00:57:53,775
Did that hurt?

490
00:57:54,737 --> 00:57:56,377
Yeah.

491
00:58:37,847 --> 00:58:40,287
What're we gonna tell the kids?

492
00:58:43,319 --> 00:58:45,421
That it's not their fault.

493
00:58:45,521 --> 00:58:48,023
<i>Sheriff, you got an ETA?
You've been gone all day.</i>

494
00:58:48,123 --> 00:58:52,433
We can't keep pretending that everything's
okay, we have to shut this place down.

495
00:58:53,662 --> 00:58:55,204
That's not gonna happen.

496
00:58:56,498 --> 00:59:01,676
And I'm coming back from... Third Eye
Academy, what do they call it?

497
00:59:01,937 --> 00:59:04,512
We sinned, Jack.

498
00:59:06,107 --> 00:59:08,582
It's about redemption.

499
00:59:10,446 --> 00:59:12,553
But we're gonna have to pay.

500
00:59:15,217 --> 00:59:17,819
<i>It's called the Mind's Eye
Academy, Sheriff.</i>

501
00:59:17,919 --> 00:59:20,255
Yeah, this place is fucked!

502
00:59:20,355 --> 00:59:22,357
<i>How come you're out there?
I didn't get a call.</i>

503
00:59:22,457 --> 00:59:26,434
- I'll tell you all about it when I get back.
- <i>All right, copy that.</i>

504
00:59:45,681 --> 00:59:47,574
What can I do?

505
00:59:47,674 --> 00:59:49,378
Leave.

506
01:00:12,875 --> 01:00:15,616
I have the strength to handle this.

507
01:00:16,445 --> 01:00:19,353
I have the strength to handle this.

508
01:00:19,915 --> 01:00:22,741
I have the strength to handle this.

509
01:00:23,719 --> 01:00:26,834
I have the strength to handle this.

510
01:00:27,856 --> 01:00:30,698
I have the strength to handle this.

511
01:00:32,027 --> 01:00:34,196
I have the strength to handle this.

512
01:00:34,296 --> 01:00:35,970
Jack.

513
01:00:42,738 --> 01:00:44,945
How'd you come back?

514
01:00:45,741 --> 01:00:47,788
Because I missed you so much.

515
01:00:48,711 --> 01:00:51,614
- You gave us no choice, Moira.
- Liar!

516
01:00:51,714 --> 01:00:54,422
Don't take another step.

517
01:01:14,869 --> 01:01:17,373
Quiet, or I'll cut
your fucking tongue out, Jack!

518
01:01:17,673 --> 01:01:19,975
- Eat what I tell you to eat!
- What?

519
01:01:20,275 --> 01:01:23,146
Eat what I tell you to eat,
when I tell you to eat it, right?

520
01:01:23,546 --> 01:01:26,015
We were only trying to help you.

521
01:01:26,215 --> 01:01:29,256
Stay down on your knees
and eat this fucking dirt.

522
01:01:34,389 --> 01:01:37,627
We attune ourselves to the desert,

523
01:01:37,727 --> 01:01:40,511
to the Earth, and to the sky.

524
01:01:55,378 --> 01:01:57,146
Nobody's fed them.

525
01:01:57,246 --> 01:01:59,248
Why are you worried
about the fucking horses?

526
01:01:59,348 --> 01:02:03,223
They're not turning up cut to pieces
with words carved into their hooves.

527
01:02:04,386 --> 01:02:07,223
Everyone's saying they're gonna
send us home after this assembly.

528
01:02:07,323 --> 01:02:11,160
I already called my mom,
she's coming to pick me up tomorrow.

529
01:02:11,260 --> 01:02:13,267
You should come with us.

530
01:02:17,999 --> 01:02:19,769
I want to.

531
01:02:19,869 --> 01:02:24,211
But I have to make sure Kaitlin's okay.
I can't leave her.

532
01:02:43,872 --> 01:02:47,713
- Hey! Where are you going?
- I'm getting the fuck outta here.

533
01:02:47,963 --> 01:02:50,933
You can't just leave, Krauss,
we have to take care of these kids.

534
01:02:51,033 --> 01:02:52,501
Are you kidding me?

535
01:02:52,601 --> 01:02:55,644
We are the last people that
should be taking care of these kids.

536
01:02:56,822 --> 01:03:00,489
Something bad is happening here.

537
01:03:00,943 --> 01:03:02,211
You're scaring me, Krauss.

538
01:03:02,311 --> 01:03:05,480
You should be scared,
we made a terrible mistake.

539
01:03:05,580 --> 01:03:10,474
I just hope... that there's something
out there that can forgive us.

540
01:03:14,023 --> 01:03:15,896
Forgive you.

541
01:03:50,125 --> 01:03:52,333
Oh, shit.

542
01:04:03,973 --> 01:04:07,277
You're the dog that does
whatever he tells you to do.

543
01:04:08,310 --> 01:04:09,739
His follower.

544
01:04:13,448 --> 01:04:14,822
His bitch.

545
01:04:17,419 --> 01:04:20,180
I didn't wanna go through with it.

546
01:04:20,689 --> 01:04:23,964
- Please, Moira...
- There's always one of you.

547
01:04:24,693 --> 01:04:27,034
What do you want from me?

548
01:04:28,180 --> 01:04:29,391
Your pain.

549
01:04:53,188 --> 01:04:55,729
Hey, hey!

550
01:04:56,091 --> 01:04:57,965
Hey!

551
01:05:04,099 --> 01:05:06,473
Help, help me!

552
01:05:06,902 --> 01:05:10,973
Help me, help me.
Fucking Moira, she's back there!

553
01:05:11,573 --> 01:05:13,647
Bring him in, get him in.

554
01:05:18,530 --> 01:05:20,318
Bitch!

555
01:05:21,646 --> 01:05:23,369
She's coming.

556
01:05:23,469 --> 01:05:25,880
You sure it was Moira?

557
01:05:27,489 --> 01:05:28,829
Yes.

558
01:05:33,362 --> 01:05:35,970
Why are we fucking waiting
in the greenhouse?

559
01:05:39,467 --> 01:05:41,540
This is fucking bullshit.

560
01:05:47,359 --> 01:05:49,962
- You betrayed me, Lincoln.
- I said I don't need you anymore!

561
01:05:50,062 --> 01:05:53,404
- Kaitlin does.
- Come on, let's get the fuck outta here!

562
01:05:59,521 --> 01:06:01,061
I don't need you...

563
01:06:05,762 --> 01:06:08,783
Stop! I said stop!

564
01:06:09,699 --> 01:06:11,367
Stop!

565
01:06:12,067 --> 01:06:14,041
Do you feel that?

566
01:06:18,173 --> 01:06:21,077
Go ahead, do it!

567
01:06:21,477 --> 01:06:23,396
Do it!

568
01:06:34,956 --> 01:06:37,898
Now you know how it feels to be alone.

569
01:07:17,799 --> 01:07:19,778
- Tell me what's going on.
- No, we have no time.

570
01:07:19,878 --> 01:07:23,238
- We have to get everybody outta here.
- Shut up. Whose blood is on your shirt?

571
01:07:23,338 --> 01:07:25,957
- Isaac's. She killed him.
- Who?

572
01:07:26,057 --> 01:07:28,044
Moira Karp.

573
01:07:28,144 --> 01:07:30,046
You fucking piece of shit liar.

574
01:07:30,146 --> 01:07:33,289
- Please, just listen...
- Shut the fuck...

575
01:07:36,084 --> 01:07:39,121
- You killed Willie, didn't you?
- Please...

576
01:07:39,221 --> 01:07:42,257
I'm calling the cops, and you're gonna
tell 'em what you fucking did.

577
01:07:42,357 --> 01:07:45,227
How you killed Willie and Derek,
and they're gonna put you away forever.

578
01:07:45,327 --> 01:07:47,301
I didn't kill 'em!

579
01:07:56,005 --> 01:07:57,278
Fuck.

580
01:08:08,314 --> 01:08:10,174
Moira?

581
01:08:12,807 --> 01:08:14,790
Try it.

582
01:08:14,890 --> 01:08:16,897
Help me.

583
01:08:18,493 --> 01:08:20,784
You want me to cut her?

584
01:08:22,063 --> 01:08:24,549
I want you to kill her.

585
01:08:24,649 --> 01:08:27,689
- She didn't do anything to you.
- They're all the same.

586
01:08:28,069 --> 01:08:31,273
We can fix this, we'll tell everybody
what happened. We'll expose the truth.

587
01:08:31,373 --> 01:08:32,813
Fuck the truth.

588
01:08:34,009 --> 01:08:38,613
- You're evil.
- No, I am strong.

589
01:08:38,713 --> 01:08:43,256
- I let them hurt me, but not anymore.
- I don't need you anymore.

590
01:08:44,786 --> 01:08:46,693
Please.

591
01:08:46,988 --> 01:08:49,462
Don't be like the rest.

592
01:08:49,925 --> 01:08:53,000
I don't need you anymore. Go away.

593
01:08:53,779 --> 01:08:57,454
You listen to me.
You said you wanted to help me!

594
01:09:00,284 --> 01:09:03,905
Go away! Go away!

595
01:09:04,005 --> 01:09:06,575
It worked for Lincoln, go away!

596
01:09:06,675 --> 01:09:09,477
Stupid girl! I was just pretending!

597
01:09:09,577 --> 01:09:12,319
- I made you come back.
- The fuck you did!

598
01:09:15,050 --> 01:09:17,056
Come on!

599
01:09:24,326 --> 01:09:26,099
Fuck.

600
01:09:29,998 --> 01:09:32,472
Get away from me!

601
01:09:35,637 --> 01:09:37,944
What are you doing?

602
01:09:48,551 --> 01:09:49,790
You.

603
01:09:53,408 --> 01:09:58,192
You come any closer and I swear I'll blow
your fucking brains out, you little cunt.

604
01:09:59,227 --> 01:10:01,663
Did you lie to my parents
about how I died?

605
01:10:02,063 --> 01:10:04,799
- We had no choice.
- You had no choice?

606
01:10:05,199 --> 01:10:07,625
Do you remember the night
I died, Christine?

607
01:10:08,870 --> 01:10:10,806
Say you remember.

608
01:10:11,306 --> 01:10:13,448
Do you remember how I died? Say it!

609
01:10:13,548 --> 01:10:15,644
I remember.

610
01:10:16,444 --> 01:10:18,580
The basement.

611
01:10:18,680 --> 01:10:23,056
The only place I felt safe from you
and your awful friends.

612
01:10:23,684 --> 01:10:25,854
I was cutting myself.

613
01:10:25,954 --> 01:10:28,829
Little cuts to control the pain.

614
01:10:29,824 --> 01:10:33,895
- I will shoot you in the fucking face.
- You were the worst!

615
01:10:33,995 --> 01:10:36,398
You made my life here hell!

616
01:10:37,298 --> 01:10:41,307
But Iverson let you
get away with everything!

617
01:10:42,571 --> 01:10:45,507
You came down there to taunt me.

618
01:10:45,607 --> 01:10:49,249
To call me evil, and call me a cunt!

619
01:10:52,731 --> 01:10:55,761
And I couldn't take it anymore.

620
01:10:56,585 --> 01:10:58,959
So I attacked you.

621
01:10:59,487 --> 01:11:02,415
God, but I was so weak then.

622
01:11:03,458 --> 01:11:06,779
What happened next, Christine,
do you remember?

623
01:11:08,329 --> 01:11:10,265
- I cut you.
- That's right!

624
01:11:10,365 --> 01:11:13,802
You held me down and you took my blade,
and you slit me open.

625
01:11:13,902 --> 01:11:16,928
Here! And here!

626
01:11:17,873 --> 01:11:21,601
And then you all came down to watch.

627
01:11:22,443 --> 01:11:27,107
Iverson, Krauss... you.

628
01:11:30,919 --> 01:11:32,926
I'm sorry.

629
01:11:33,688 --> 01:11:36,224
I didn't wanna die!

630
01:11:36,324 --> 01:11:38,693
I asked you to help me,
don't you remember?

631
01:11:38,793 --> 01:11:41,839
I said, "Help me, please!"

632
01:11:44,566 --> 01:11:47,534
A troubled girl who killed herself.

633
01:11:47,634 --> 01:11:50,477
Iverson could make that work.

634
01:11:51,873 --> 01:11:54,143
And then you kicked me.

635
01:11:54,243 --> 01:11:57,604
Just to see if I was dead yet.

636
01:11:57,704 --> 01:12:00,181
That's the last thing I remember,

637
01:12:00,281 --> 01:12:04,076
is your foot pressing into my chest!

638
01:12:07,222 --> 01:12:10,759
- I don't wanna do this, Moira.
- Oh, I think you do.

639
01:12:10,859 --> 01:12:14,370
- No, I don't.
- I think you want it bad.

640
01:12:16,931 --> 01:12:19,139
Come on, Christine.

641
01:12:19,500 --> 01:12:22,008
Let me feel your hate.

642
01:12:23,405 --> 01:12:26,246
I'm so, so sorry.

643
01:12:34,315 --> 01:12:35,951
Come on!

644
01:12:36,051 --> 01:12:38,125
Lincoln.

645
01:12:43,551 --> 01:12:45,598
Oh, fuck.

646
01:12:49,097 --> 01:12:53,365
I fucked everything up.
And I can't change that, but right now...

647
01:12:53,465 --> 01:12:56,371
I love you.
More than I've ever loved anyone,

648
01:12:56,471 --> 01:12:59,784
and if I'm going to die here,
I need you to believe that.

649
01:13:02,343 --> 01:13:03,870
You're not gonna die.

650
01:13:06,982 --> 01:13:08,822
Shit.

651
01:13:10,985 --> 01:13:13,426
None of this shit's gonna help us.

652
01:14:45,580 --> 01:14:47,887
You fucking traitors!

653
01:14:48,617 --> 01:14:52,189
My life was hell
because of girls like you.

654
01:14:55,690 --> 01:14:57,392
Moira!

655
01:14:57,892 --> 01:15:00,100
What's it gonna take to stop you?

656
01:15:02,130 --> 01:15:04,371
Everybody dying.

657
01:15:05,834 --> 01:15:08,207
Oh, I dare you.

658
01:15:14,343 --> 01:15:16,816
Let's die together, Lincoln.

659
01:15:19,980 --> 01:15:21,454
I'm not afraid of you.

660
01:15:22,684 --> 01:15:24,346
You should be.

661
01:15:32,957 --> 01:15:34,792
Moira!

662
01:15:41,770 --> 01:15:44,010
Lincoln, no!

663
01:16:24,210 --> 01:16:26,886
Lincoln, no!

664
01:16:31,653 --> 01:16:33,802
Lincoln!

665
01:17:06,755 --> 01:17:10,392
I can't believe you did that.
Please look at me.

666
01:17:10,492 --> 01:17:12,272
Lincoln, look at me.

667
01:17:12,372 --> 01:17:14,902
Lincoln, look at me.
You're gonna be okay.

668
01:20:27,522 --> 01:20:30,147
I wish they were all dead.

669
01:20:30,958 --> 01:20:32,966
I wish they were all dead.

670
01:20:34,562 --> 01:20:36,065
I wish they were all dead.

671
01:20:37,365 --> 01:20:40,260
They'll never fuck with us, again.
