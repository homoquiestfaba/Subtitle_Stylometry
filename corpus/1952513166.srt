1
00:00:15,015 --> 00:00:16,949
I don't trust words.

2
00:00:17,650 --> 00:00:20,346
Words and I are not good friends at all.

3
00:00:20,887 --> 00:00:24,448
A painter using words,
it's like a baby trying to walk.

4
00:00:26,893 --> 00:00:31,387
Better to let the picture speak on its own
than try to help it along with a word.

5
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:16,868
What has happened to me in the past
and how it has happened,

6
00:01:17,477 --> 00:01:21,004
I don't think that's anyone's business,
except my own.

7
00:01:21,081 --> 00:01:24,380
You just look at the paintings,
see what you can see in the paintings.

8
00:01:24,451 --> 00:01:29,184
That's all you have a right to see.
That's all I will allow you to see.

9
00:01:29,989 --> 00:01:31,251
So, there.

10
00:01:43,136 --> 00:01:47,630
Someone else's vision will never be
as good as your own vision of yourself.

11
00:01:48,274 --> 00:01:52,677
Live and die with it.
Because in the end, that's all you have.

12
00:01:53,546 --> 00:01:57,107
Lose it, and you lose yourself
and everything else.

13
00:02:00,353 --> 00:02:02,787
I should have listened to myself.

14
00:02:28,748 --> 00:02:31,842
Extraordinary, aren't they?
Drawn by a woman.

15
00:02:33,786 --> 00:02:34,844
Yes.

16
00:02:36,756 --> 00:02:39,554
- Please take them down.
- Beg your pardon?

17
00:02:40,727 --> 00:02:42,319
You heard me.

18
00:02:43,963 --> 00:02:45,590
Yes, I did, but...

19
00:02:48,034 --> 00:02:50,298
No, I will not take them down.

20
00:02:51,304 --> 00:02:53,067
And who the devil do you think you are,
anyway?

21
00:02:53,139 --> 00:02:55,437
I am Georgia O'Keeffe,
and these are my drawings,

22
00:02:55,508 --> 00:02:57,908
and I think that... No, I am sure...

23
00:03:00,079 --> 00:03:03,139
You never asked my permission
to show them, did you?

24
00:03:04,117 --> 00:03:08,679
- No, I did not ask your permission.
- Well, then you'll have to take them down.

25
00:03:11,958 --> 00:03:16,258
Do you have any idea what you have done
in these pictures?

26
00:03:16,329 --> 00:03:19,457
Of course I do. Do you think I'm an idiot?

27
00:03:20,466 --> 00:03:23,196
No, I think you are a revelation.

28
00:03:25,038 --> 00:03:27,006
Well, no one else seems to share
your opinion.

29
00:03:27,073 --> 00:03:28,631
For God's sake, woman.

30
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:30,801
I've hung your work
next to some of the greatest artists

31
00:03:30,877 --> 00:03:32,037
of this or any age,

32
00:03:32,111 --> 00:03:36,775
Picasso, Matisse, Dove, Hartley,
Braque, Cezanne.

33
00:03:37,383 --> 00:03:42,252
And I've done so because I see in your work
the same raw, intuitive,

34
00:03:42,322 --> 00:03:48,921
irrational, unconscious, untutored talents
from whence all true creativity erupts,

35
00:03:48,995 --> 00:03:50,394
male or female.

36
00:03:51,130 --> 00:03:56,193
And you, Miss O'Keeffe, have no more right
to withhold these pictures

37
00:03:56,269 --> 00:03:59,761
than you have to withdraw a child
from the world,

38
00:03:59,839 --> 00:04:01,932
if you had given birth to one.

39
00:04:02,675 --> 00:04:04,336
You sure can talk.

40
00:04:07,146 --> 00:04:10,809
In every painting,
there is all of your life coming back at you,

41
00:04:10,883 --> 00:04:14,717
not just one flower or a piece of bone or sky.

42
00:04:14,787 --> 00:04:18,883
That's just what you see at the end
when the work is finished.

43
00:04:19,892 --> 00:04:22,861
But at the start,
when you look at the empty canvas,

44
00:04:22,929 --> 00:04:25,921
you see your whole life looking back at you.

45
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:29,633
I learned that from Mr. Stieglitz.

46
00:04:31,170 --> 00:04:36,267
Everything I know I learned from him,
or because of him, or in spite of him.

47
00:04:55,862 --> 00:04:57,261
Well, hello.

48
00:04:57,797 --> 00:05:00,027
- I'll take your bag.
- Thank you.

49
00:05:02,435 --> 00:05:03,732
So...

50
00:05:05,605 --> 00:05:06,902
This is it.

51
00:05:08,508 --> 00:05:10,635
It belongs to my niece, Elizabeth,

52
00:05:12,145 --> 00:05:15,911
but you'll be welcome to stay
as long as you want.

53
00:05:21,554 --> 00:05:24,887
I work a little in here,
but I don't use that room at all.

54
00:05:26,726 --> 00:05:29,627
Apart from the closet. I use it as a...

55
00:05:29,696 --> 00:05:33,393
I'm sorry. These...
I shouldn't have put these on here.

56
00:05:34,567 --> 00:05:38,264
I use the darkroom a little bit
for storing things and developing,

57
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:41,307
but this will be your room.

58
00:05:43,343 --> 00:05:45,038
See, I don't live here.

59
00:05:46,646 --> 00:05:51,549
I live up on Madison with my family, my wife.

60
00:05:52,518 --> 00:05:55,681
- I did mention I had a wife?
- Yes.

61
00:05:57,357 --> 00:05:58,756
Good.

62
00:05:59,425 --> 00:06:03,054
So you wouldn't be disturbed here at all.
We would schedule my work

63
00:06:03,129 --> 00:06:07,725
so that it didn't conflict
with your creative necessities,

64
00:06:09,001 --> 00:06:13,734
and my visits would be promulgated
on your permissions.

65
00:06:16,075 --> 00:06:17,303
Well,

66
00:06:20,113 --> 00:06:22,741
- it's a very attractive proposition.
- Yeah, it's...

67
00:06:22,815 --> 00:06:25,306
A room of my own in the city of New York.

68
00:06:26,352 --> 00:06:29,617
And all it will cost me
is a few regularly scheduled visits

69
00:06:29,689 --> 00:06:31,748
- from my benefactor. Is that the idea?
- No!

70
00:06:31,824 --> 00:06:34,918
No, no. I didn't mean...
I didn't mean to imply...

71
00:06:34,994 --> 00:06:36,518
I believe you did.

72
00:06:41,167 --> 00:06:44,295
I'm sorry, Mr. Stieglitz.
I can't help being honest.

73
00:06:44,370 --> 00:06:46,497
- No.
- I don't know if it's a fault in my nature

74
00:06:46,572 --> 00:06:50,508
or a good thing,
but I've never had any choice in the matter.

75
00:06:55,081 --> 00:06:58,744
I do have a teaching position in Texas,
and they're expecting me to return.

76
00:06:58,818 --> 00:07:03,653
- ln Texas? Where in Texas?
- West Texas State Normal College.

77
00:07:03,723 --> 00:07:06,157
Nothing is normal in Texas, Miss O'Keeffe.

78
00:07:07,293 --> 00:07:12,026
But, in any case, I'll tell you flat-out,
I intend to accept your proposition.

79
00:07:13,466 --> 00:07:16,765
You mean... Well, good.

80
00:07:17,837 --> 00:07:20,704
But the bed belongs under the skylight.

81
00:07:22,308 --> 00:07:24,833
- No, let me do that.
- Yeah.

82
00:07:26,712 --> 00:07:29,943
Because, you see,
then I can lie on my back at night

83
00:07:30,016 --> 00:07:35,579
and look at the stars circling your head,
if such an occasion should arise.

84
00:07:36,522 --> 00:07:40,925
Miss O'Keeffe,
you are teasing me unmercifully.

85
00:07:41,694 --> 00:07:44,356
Yes, I am, and I'm enjoying it, too.

86
00:08:02,515 --> 00:08:05,882
Morning. I'm just collecting.

87
00:08:26,606 --> 00:08:27,868
I want to...

88
00:08:28,641 --> 00:08:30,632
Would you mind if I photographed you?

89
00:08:31,911 --> 00:08:33,742
You have a beautiful face.

90
00:08:35,581 --> 00:08:38,243
My mother used to put me in the back room
when company came.

91
00:08:38,317 --> 00:08:42,151
- She thought I was so homely.
- Homely?

92
00:08:43,923 --> 00:08:46,016
You are not homely, Miss O'Keeffe.

93
00:08:46,092 --> 00:08:48,959
I'm not fishing for compliments,
Mr. Stieglitz.

94
00:08:49,028 --> 00:08:50,757
I know what I look like.

95
00:08:53,065 --> 00:08:55,329
You have no idea what you look like.

96
00:09:20,092 --> 00:09:21,719
Mr. Stieglitz?

97
00:10:19,285 --> 00:10:20,946
Put this on.

98
00:11:04,296 --> 00:11:07,629
Right, now... You're a skinny little thing.

99
00:11:10,036 --> 00:11:13,301
There we are. Tie it around there.

100
00:11:18,711 --> 00:11:22,579
We're gonna use four bottles.

101
00:11:24,050 --> 00:11:26,018
And if you'll hold that...

102
00:11:26,485 --> 00:11:31,616
What was it? Four, three. That makes it 12.
Now, 12 water.

103
00:11:31,691 --> 00:11:34,683
- Now feel that corner. Just feel it. Feel that?
- Yes.

104
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:39,288
That tells you that the exposed side
is underneath, and that's the bottom right.

105
00:11:39,365 --> 00:11:40,923
So you can always know
that with a negative.

106
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,468
- All right.
- Pull that out.

107
00:11:43,536 --> 00:11:49,532
And slip it in. Slip it into the water.
Just... Good. That's right.

108
00:11:51,077 --> 00:11:52,567
That's good. That's good.

109
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:55,076
- It's all right?
- That comes... Yeah.

110
00:11:57,249 --> 00:11:58,614
Well, look at that.

111
00:11:58,684 --> 00:12:03,348
That's everything I feel about you
fixed in a moment.

112
00:12:07,927 --> 00:12:09,986
Don't look at me like that.

113
00:12:11,664 --> 00:12:14,497
It's not magic. It's you.

114
00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:20,194
- Once again, who is it?
- O'Keeffe. Georgia O'Keeffe.

115
00:12:20,272 --> 00:12:22,797
- Georgia O'Keeffe.
- Yeah, I think... I think you'll enjoy her.

116
00:12:22,875 --> 00:12:26,242
They're great images,
and the colors are really great.

117
00:12:27,747 --> 00:12:31,308
- Are you gonna buy anything?
- I think not.

118
00:12:31,383 --> 00:12:33,010
Look at that piece over there.

119
00:12:33,085 --> 00:12:36,179
Whereas the Marins
are like an orchestra run wild.

120
00:12:36,255 --> 00:12:38,155
- He was destroyed by the reviews.
- Yeah.

121
00:12:38,224 --> 00:12:40,749
Holder called his pictures
"great gobs of imbecility."

122
00:12:40,826 --> 00:12:43,158
Yeah, well, Holder was absolutely wrong.

123
00:12:46,298 --> 00:12:48,357
Men and words.

124
00:12:48,434 --> 00:12:51,062
But whenever I can't get to sleep,
I just get my husband talking like that,

125
00:12:51,137 --> 00:12:52,866
and it puts me right out.

126
00:12:53,506 --> 00:12:55,736
- I'm Rebecca Strand.
- Georgia O'Keeffe.

127
00:12:55,808 --> 00:12:57,002
I know.

128
00:12:57,743 --> 00:12:59,608
But why the depression?

129
00:12:59,678 --> 00:13:03,409
Why the half whisper, the half light,
the soft petal?

130
00:13:03,482 --> 00:13:05,279
The fear of full color?

131
00:13:05,918 --> 00:13:07,180
- Are we afraid?
- Yes.

132
00:13:07,253 --> 00:13:10,279
- And if so, of what? Ourselves?
- Yes! Yes!

133
00:13:10,356 --> 00:13:13,484
My dear, whatever do you look like?

134
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:19,629
A nun, an acolyte, a virgin at the orgy.
It's fantastic.

135
00:13:19,698 --> 00:13:21,325
And the shoes.

136
00:13:21,901 --> 00:13:24,597
Please promise you won't ever tell me
where they come from.

137
00:13:24,670 --> 00:13:28,037
I won't. If you promise never to tell me
where you come from.

138
00:13:30,075 --> 00:13:33,772
Mrs. Mabel Evans Dodge Stern.
That's three, isn't it?

139
00:13:34,313 --> 00:13:37,840
I've had three husbands so far.
I collect husbands.

140
00:13:38,517 --> 00:13:41,418
And you are Alfred's newest plaything.

141
00:13:42,054 --> 00:13:44,750
The milkmaid from Wisconsin.

142
00:13:45,524 --> 00:13:48,459
My God. He picks up lovers like olives.

143
00:13:49,061 --> 00:13:52,360
Dangerous man. Absolute genius.

144
00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:54,962
You're not in love with him, are you?

145
00:13:56,468 --> 00:13:59,904
You are. Aren't you?

146
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:02,732
Oh, my dear, my condolences.

147
00:14:03,475 --> 00:14:07,571
Well, headfirst into the fire. Why not?
Life is short.

148
00:14:07,646 --> 00:14:10,342
Come on. Come meet
some of the other dogs in my kennel.

149
00:14:10,416 --> 00:14:12,816
They're all bastards, every one of them.

150
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:15,146
- Paul Strand.
- Hi, Mabel.

151
00:14:15,221 --> 00:14:16,483
He's one.

152
00:14:16,555 --> 00:14:20,013
- And, Becca, have you met Georgia?
- Yes.

153
00:14:21,794 --> 00:14:24,957
And Jean Toomer. Now, he is a poet,
he's a philosopher,

154
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:28,727
he's absolutely gorgeous.
I'd marry him in a second.

155
00:14:28,801 --> 00:14:32,828
- Except, of course, that I'm already married.
- That's never stopped you before.

156
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:38,105
Now, you must come to my house in Taos.
It's heaven.

157
00:14:38,844 --> 00:14:40,869
Don't even think about saying no.

158
00:14:41,247 --> 00:14:42,509
Jean Toomer.

159
00:14:43,315 --> 00:14:47,843
- Georgia O'Keeffe, my new best friend.
- It's a pleasure to meet you.

160
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:49,785
Whatever that is, give me two of them.

161
00:14:59,398 --> 00:15:00,922
What's this all about?

162
00:15:01,433 --> 00:15:05,199
I may not know what art is,
but I know what art isn't.

163
00:15:05,871 --> 00:15:08,806
- And this isn't art.
- You're fearless.

164
00:15:09,975 --> 00:15:14,105
Mr. Stieglitz,
I've been absolutely terrified my entire life,

165
00:15:14,179 --> 00:15:18,479
and I have never let it keep me
from doing a single thing I wanted to do.

166
00:15:36,402 --> 00:15:39,496
Don't move for three minutes.

167
00:15:43,075 --> 00:15:46,977
From here to here.

168
00:16:00,225 --> 00:16:03,592
My mother died from malnutrition
and tuberculosis.

169
00:16:05,864 --> 00:16:07,661
She hemorrhaged and bled to death.

170
00:16:09,535 --> 00:16:14,234
No one knew she was sick,
and she never asked for help.

171
00:16:18,043 --> 00:16:19,806
She died alone and hungry.

172
00:16:21,814 --> 00:16:25,807
I'm like her, starving,

173
00:16:27,052 --> 00:16:29,885
yet too proud to know that I need help.

174
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:33,185
What sort of help?

175
00:16:34,994 --> 00:16:37,053
I have things in my head.

176
00:16:37,129 --> 00:16:40,792
I don't know where they come from.
I don't know how they get there.

177
00:16:40,866 --> 00:16:44,768
Shapes and ideas that are so near to me,

178
00:16:44,837 --> 00:16:49,103
they're so natural to my way of being
and thinking,

179
00:16:51,410 --> 00:16:53,503
and I need to get them out of my head

180
00:16:56,715 --> 00:16:58,740
and bring them into the world.

181
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:16,829
Emmy.

182
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:33,279
I've left her.

183
00:17:37,056 --> 00:17:40,822
Twenty-five years of unhappiness,
it took me one hour, 15 minutes.

184
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:44,558
Yes! Here, here.

185
00:17:49,868 --> 00:17:51,631
I don't suppose you have room for a lodger.

186
00:17:51,703 --> 00:17:55,264
We might have one space for you,
Mr. Stieglitz.

187
00:17:57,376 --> 00:17:59,173
What are you doing?

188
00:17:59,244 --> 00:18:01,041
If you're gonna have a lodger
and it's gonna be me,

189
00:18:01,113 --> 00:18:03,343
then if we have visitors,
we need some propriety.

190
00:18:03,415 --> 00:18:05,246
We can't have them thinking
we sleep in the same room.

191
00:18:05,317 --> 00:18:08,445
Really? Really?
We can't? We can't? We can't?

192
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:13,048
- We have got to...
- No, no, no, no.

193
00:18:28,273 --> 00:18:31,674
You know, one day, you're gonna
have to put some color on those.

194
00:18:35,581 --> 00:18:39,711
They have to dry. It takes six months.

195
00:18:49,161 --> 00:18:52,858
Do you know what I miss
more than anything in New York?

196
00:18:52,931 --> 00:18:54,421
No.

197
00:18:56,335 --> 00:19:00,567
Tell me what you miss, and I'll get it for you.

198
00:19:03,609 --> 00:19:05,304
I miss the sky.

199
00:19:42,281 --> 00:19:46,149
So, this is the woman
who destroyed my son's marriage.

200
00:19:47,619 --> 00:19:51,453
Pleased. Very pleased to meet you.

201
00:19:52,925 --> 00:19:54,722
Well done, Alfred.

202
00:20:08,207 --> 00:20:09,469
Right.

203
00:20:15,914 --> 00:20:19,907
- What did... What did you do there?
- I just adjusted the wicket. That's all.

204
00:20:19,985 --> 00:20:22,146
All right, now, is it... Is it my go or your go?

205
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:24,314
- It's yours.
- All right.

206
00:20:29,428 --> 00:20:30,486
Yes!

207
00:20:56,455 --> 00:21:00,391
To be perfectly honest,
no one misses your wife, Alfred, do they?

208
00:21:01,593 --> 00:21:05,495
She was a cow. You're lucky to be rid of her.

209
00:21:06,932 --> 00:21:08,524
Of course, there is Kitty.

210
00:21:09,101 --> 00:21:12,730
It's always hard on the children,
these extramarital affairs.

211
00:21:12,804 --> 00:21:18,174
That is what you call them now, isn't it?
From the Latin "extra," outside of,

212
00:21:18,243 --> 00:21:21,610
and also, appropriately,
besides or on top of.

213
00:21:22,180 --> 00:21:25,308
As in, a little something extra on the side.

214
00:21:25,384 --> 00:21:27,443
- Mother, please.
- Lee!

215
00:21:27,719 --> 00:21:30,381
I won't mention the unmentionables.

216
00:21:30,455 --> 00:21:34,653
I won't mention your wife's distant cousin,
Amanda, what's-her-name, Hoff?

217
00:21:34,726 --> 00:21:38,127
Mrs. Hoff is, as I'm sure you know,
as the whole world knows,

218
00:21:38,196 --> 00:21:41,097
my son Lee's very special friend.

219
00:21:41,166 --> 00:21:45,500
We don't mention Mrs. Hoff in this house
lest we upset Mrs. Hoff's husband,

220
00:21:45,570 --> 00:21:47,629
not to mention Lee's wife.

221
00:21:48,407 --> 00:21:52,741
Tell me, Alfred,
do you think modern art is a reflection

222
00:21:52,811 --> 00:21:54,938
of this very modern way of life?

223
00:21:55,013 --> 00:21:59,074
Or do you think that this unmentionable way
of modern life

224
00:21:59,151 --> 00:22:02,746
inspires the wretched refuse
we now call art?

225
00:22:04,089 --> 00:22:06,182
Did I say something funny?

226
00:23:28,407 --> 00:23:29,601
Wider, please.

227
00:23:32,477 --> 00:23:36,743
- Can you see anything?
- Absolutely nothing.

228
00:23:37,716 --> 00:23:40,344
Well, look some more.
There's something going on.

229
00:23:42,487 --> 00:23:44,387
I was up half the night.

230
00:23:44,990 --> 00:23:47,515
- You're perfectly fine.
- ls there any inflammation?

231
00:23:47,592 --> 00:23:48,854
No.

232
00:23:48,927 --> 00:23:53,728
Nothing a few years of intense
psychoanalysis wouldn't cure.

233
00:23:53,799 --> 00:23:56,029
I don't find that amusing.

234
00:23:56,101 --> 00:23:58,433
Put your shirt back on or you will get sick.

235
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:04,170
- Alfred...
- Thank you.

236
00:24:04,776 --> 00:24:07,574
You're my brother.
You don't need to thank me.

237
00:24:07,646 --> 00:24:12,345
Just with Emmy gone,
I find myself without a regular income.

238
00:24:12,417 --> 00:24:17,480
I still have regular expenses with the gallery
and magazine,

239
00:24:18,056 --> 00:24:22,652
- so I do find myself a little bit short.
- Please. I understand.

240
00:24:23,595 --> 00:24:25,790
- I'll pay you back.
- I'm sure you will.

241
00:24:27,232 --> 00:24:30,167
- I've started photographing again.
- Good.

242
00:24:30,702 --> 00:24:34,468
And I'm planning
a wonderful new exhibition.

243
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:36,532
I'm sure.

244
00:24:36,608 --> 00:24:41,739
A series of photographs of one person.
You can guess who.

245
00:24:42,214 --> 00:24:47,413
Straight photographs. No tricks of any kind.
No humbug. No sentimentalism.

246
00:24:47,486 --> 00:24:50,649
Prints so sharp you can see the pores
in the skin.

247
00:24:51,156 --> 00:24:54,421
Heads, ears, toes, hands, torsos,

248
00:24:55,994 --> 00:25:01,990
clean-cut, heartfelt bits of universality
in the shape of a woman.

249
00:25:02,968 --> 00:25:06,563
There's been nothing like it before.
It'll cause a sensation,

250
00:25:07,606 --> 00:25:10,575
and I'll finally have the money
to pay you back.

251
00:25:10,642 --> 00:25:14,237
- You and everybody else.
- I wish you all the best, Alfred.

252
00:25:14,312 --> 00:25:16,780
Why do you always sound so skeptical?

253
00:25:16,848 --> 00:25:18,839
Well, last time I heard you this excited

254
00:25:18,917 --> 00:25:21,078
is when you showed those paintings of
what's-his-name?

255
00:25:21,152 --> 00:25:24,849
Nobody ever heard of him.
He was Italian, drew people with two noses.

256
00:25:24,923 --> 00:25:28,723
- I can never remember his name.
- Pablo Picasso. And he's Spanish.

257
00:25:28,793 --> 00:25:32,354
You were over the moon.
I've never seen you so worked up.

258
00:25:32,430 --> 00:25:35,695
You hung dozens of paintings,
didn't sell a single one.

259
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:39,600
Well, he's still the greatest living painter
ever to come along in my lifetime.

260
00:25:39,671 --> 00:25:42,265
- And you're still broke.
- Yeah, but that's...

261
00:25:45,644 --> 00:25:47,373
Will he live, Dr. Stieglitz?

262
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:49,904
I don't know if I'd better kiss you.
You might catch...

263
00:25:49,981 --> 00:25:51,346
Yes, you can.

264
00:25:56,054 --> 00:25:57,988
Georgia, it's me, Alfred.

265
00:26:00,025 --> 00:26:01,925
- Go away. Nobody home.
- Now, come on.

266
00:26:01,993 --> 00:26:04,860
- Georgia, open the door.
- No, no. I'm working.

267
00:26:05,597 --> 00:26:07,121
Well, we'll work together. Open the door.

268
00:26:07,198 --> 00:26:11,134
No. Sorry, Alfred. This is my place.
You have to find your own place.

269
00:26:11,202 --> 00:26:12,999
What do you mean, this is your place?
I built this thing.

270
00:26:13,071 --> 00:26:16,131
- It's on my property, for God's sake.
- Well, do you own the grass?

271
00:26:16,641 --> 00:26:18,006
Because I've been walking on it,

272
00:26:18,076 --> 00:26:20,203
and I don't remember
asking your permission.

273
00:26:20,278 --> 00:26:22,974
Don't be so stupid. Just open the door.
Come on.

274
00:26:24,215 --> 00:26:25,739
What are you doing in there?

275
00:26:25,817 --> 00:26:29,082
- Let me in. Come on. Let me in.
- No! I'm working!

276
00:26:42,467 --> 00:26:45,231
- How could you do this to us?
- Emmy, I never meant to hurt you,

277
00:26:45,303 --> 00:26:47,271
but I thought if you would meet her,
if you could see her,

278
00:26:47,339 --> 00:26:48,397
then you would understand,

279
00:26:48,473 --> 00:26:49,804
- and if we understand each other...
- Alfred, please!

280
00:26:49,874 --> 00:26:51,637
- ...then we could live together.
- What are you saying?

281
00:26:51,710 --> 00:26:53,974
You, Kitty, me and Georgia.

282
00:26:54,045 --> 00:26:56,639
- Alfred, you are a child.
- You're my wife!

283
00:26:56,715 --> 00:26:58,444
- You're an idiot!
- I care deeply about you.

284
00:26:58,516 --> 00:27:02,577
That's why I invited you here to meet her!
Why is it whatever I try to do, I hurt you?

285
00:27:02,654 --> 00:27:04,383
Two people I want to hurt least in the world!

286
00:27:04,456 --> 00:27:07,186
You are free to live your life as you choose,

287
00:27:07,258 --> 00:27:09,123
but flaunting that woman
and throwing her in our faces...

288
00:27:09,194 --> 00:27:12,652
I am not flaunting her!
I just want you to meet her, for God's sake!

289
00:27:12,731 --> 00:27:14,221
- No!
- I am not flaunting.

290
00:27:14,299 --> 00:27:17,291
Mr. Stieglitz, it's time for us to leave now.

291
00:27:31,916 --> 00:27:37,479
So, no matter how modern our ways,

292
00:27:37,555 --> 00:27:40,991
- we remain stuck in the last century.
- Shut up, Mother.

293
00:27:41,059 --> 00:27:43,926
Goodbye, Georgia. Good luck, dear.

294
00:27:54,072 --> 00:27:55,903
I, Georgia, take you, Alfred...

295
00:27:55,974 --> 00:27:58,807
- As my lawful wedded husband...
- ...as my lawful wedded husband...

296
00:27:58,877 --> 00:28:01,141
- ...to have and to hold...
- ...to have and to hold...

297
00:28:01,212 --> 00:28:03,544
...to love, honor and obey...

298
00:28:03,615 --> 00:28:08,143
- Let's skip that part. What comes next?
- Well, the rings?

299
00:28:09,354 --> 00:28:13,154
We don't have any rings.
We don't need rings, do we?

300
00:28:14,092 --> 00:28:16,492
- No, not necessarily.
- Good.

301
00:28:16,561 --> 00:28:21,191
So, well, I guess I now pronounce you
man and wife.

302
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:25,431
- Congratulations, Mrs. Stieglitz.
- O'Keeffe. Ms. O'Keeffe.

303
00:28:48,460 --> 00:28:50,860
We don't have any money,
do we, Mr. Stieglitz?

304
00:28:50,929 --> 00:28:54,057
An artist doesn't work for money.
He works for pleasure.

305
00:28:56,067 --> 00:28:59,628
I never took any commission at the gallery.
Not a penny.

306
00:29:01,573 --> 00:29:06,738
Picasso, Braque, Rodin,
showed them all for nothing.

307
00:29:07,112 --> 00:29:09,012
Even you, Miss O'Keeffe.

308
00:29:09,914 --> 00:29:12,644
So, in other words,
we don't have any money.

309
00:29:13,718 --> 00:29:18,746
Well, we have money,
it's just we're a little short at the moment.

310
00:29:23,228 --> 00:29:28,291
Well, when things got bad at the farm,
there was always one solution.

311
00:29:30,001 --> 00:29:32,162
- And what was that?
- Have a baby.

312
00:29:32,237 --> 00:29:35,968
- Yeah. Perfect logic.
- I'm serious.

313
00:29:39,344 --> 00:29:40,709
What about?

314
00:29:42,981 --> 00:29:44,380
Having a baby.

315
00:29:46,684 --> 00:29:50,450
No. I'm too old for that. I have a family.

316
00:29:50,955 --> 00:29:53,423
Well, I had a family.

317
00:29:55,894 --> 00:29:58,055
I did it once, and I did it badly.

318
00:29:58,129 --> 00:30:01,963
Anyhow, what would happen to your work
with a screaming child running about,

319
00:30:02,033 --> 00:30:04,797
using up your time and your attention?

320
00:30:04,869 --> 00:30:08,999
- Alfred, people have children all the time.
- We don't need a child.

321
00:30:09,474 --> 00:30:12,500
- It's not a question of need.
- You're my child,

322
00:30:15,346 --> 00:30:16,870
and I'm yours.

323
00:30:18,283 --> 00:30:22,720
You're my family, my all, my everything.
Let's just be thankful for that, all right?

324
00:30:32,230 --> 00:30:35,393
- Well, it might be a good thing.
- Why are you going on about this?

325
00:30:35,466 --> 00:30:38,902
- I'm only expressing my opinion.
- No, you're not! You're defying me!

326
00:30:38,970 --> 00:30:40,904
You're denying me the rightness
of what I'm saying!

327
00:30:40,972 --> 00:30:44,100
- Do not do that! Do not do that!
- Alfred! Why are you so upset?

328
00:30:44,175 --> 00:30:46,200
Is it... Is it...
Are you upset about having a child

329
00:30:46,277 --> 00:30:48,768
or that I'm expressing my own opinion?
Can't I express my own opinion?

330
00:30:48,847 --> 00:30:53,477
Listen. You are here in this studio,
on this earth,

331
00:30:54,619 --> 00:30:59,613
you are here to paint!
Not to breed, to paint! Paint! Paint!

332
00:31:11,970 --> 00:31:13,369
I'm sorry.

333
00:31:15,473 --> 00:31:22,174
It's just that I know
I can't give you everything you need.

334
00:31:35,293 --> 00:31:39,821
It's just funny.
Everyone assumes you're so rich.

335
00:31:42,066 --> 00:31:43,624
Not you.

336
00:31:45,703 --> 00:31:47,967
I never assumed you were anything,

337
00:31:49,607 --> 00:31:53,338
except a great shining star,
and I was hitching a ride on you.

338
00:31:59,717 --> 00:32:03,084
It's very warm in here.
Would you undo my collar for me?

339
00:32:15,867 --> 00:32:17,334
And my shirt?

340
00:32:27,245 --> 00:32:30,544
Stieglitz has brought the lens
close to the epidermis

341
00:32:30,615 --> 00:32:33,948
to reveal O'Keeffe in her full glory.

342
00:32:34,018 --> 00:32:39,081
The vagina, the pubic hair, the nipples,
the bare buttocks,

343
00:32:39,157 --> 00:32:42,752
the breasts in their voluptuous splendor.

344
00:32:42,827 --> 00:32:48,459
He has dared to show us the naked female
as she has never been seen before,

345
00:32:48,533 --> 00:32:53,630
capturing the gesture
of impassioned surrender.

346
00:32:53,705 --> 00:32:55,832
Alfred hates it when I'm late.

347
00:33:10,922 --> 00:33:12,446
Isn't that...

348
00:33:13,725 --> 00:33:16,091
- That's O'Keeffe.
- I can't recognize her.

349
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:17,627
O'Keeffe.

350
00:33:30,041 --> 00:33:32,771
- You can't leave.
- You bastard.

351
00:33:32,844 --> 00:33:36,473
- You bastard! How could you do that to me?
- I am making you famous.

352
00:33:36,547 --> 00:33:41,780
Those pictures were my love for you,
my gift to you, not to the world.

353
00:33:41,853 --> 00:33:45,584
- Don't you understand the difference?
- Are you ashamed of your body?

354
00:33:45,656 --> 00:33:48,386
I am ashamed that you have undressed me
in public,

355
00:33:49,660 --> 00:33:52,823
revealed my most private parts
for every man on the street to see.

356
00:33:52,897 --> 00:33:56,458
- I'm not famous. I am infamous.
- Famous, infamous, what does it matter?

357
00:33:56,534 --> 00:33:59,697
Yesterday you were nobody,
but today you're somebody.

358
00:33:59,771 --> 00:34:02,865
- I've made you important!
- A freak in a sideshow.

359
00:34:02,940 --> 00:34:09,004
No, like a woman proud of her feelings
and her instincts, her body and her sex.

360
00:34:12,350 --> 00:34:14,750
- Alfred.
- Good evening.

361
00:34:17,355 --> 00:34:20,222
Emma Goldman can preach free love
and feminine power

362
00:34:20,291 --> 00:34:23,818
till she's blue in the face, but you embody it.
You are it.

363
00:34:24,529 --> 00:34:26,554
You live it and breathe it,

364
00:34:26,631 --> 00:34:29,828
and all the world can see that
in my photographs,

365
00:34:30,968 --> 00:34:34,836
a model of the female essence
that's never been seen before.

366
00:34:37,408 --> 00:34:40,775
It's the truth. It's the truth.

367
00:34:40,845 --> 00:34:44,645
Truth or untruth, I do not need to advertise
what I am in public

368
00:34:44,715 --> 00:34:45,807
for all of New York to see.

369
00:34:45,883 --> 00:34:49,284
No. You could have stayed down in Normal,
Texas, God help you,

370
00:34:49,353 --> 00:34:51,981
and painted your brilliant little heart out
for the rest of your days.

371
00:34:52,056 --> 00:34:55,423
No one would have noticed
or taken the slightest attention of you.

372
00:34:56,260 --> 00:35:00,526
Work doesn't become art until
some rich person comes along and buys it.

373
00:35:00,598 --> 00:35:01,792
Then it's art.

374
00:35:02,467 --> 00:35:03,991
Look.

375
00:35:04,068 --> 00:35:09,802
Tomorrow, in the New York Herald,
McBride's gonna say,

376
00:35:09,874 --> 00:35:15,176
"This O'Keeffe woman is a sensation.
She is one long, loud blast of sex.

377
00:35:15,246 --> 00:35:17,305
"Everybody knows her name,

378
00:35:17,381 --> 00:35:20,942
"and now everybody
will want to know her painting.

379
00:35:21,018 --> 00:35:24,647
"She is a female American Picasso."

380
00:35:27,058 --> 00:35:30,118
- You planned this.
- Of course I did.

381
00:35:31,095 --> 00:35:35,862
McBride's article was written weeks ago.
Open your eyes!

382
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:37,394
Here.

383
00:35:38,636 --> 00:35:43,801
Here's Barnes and Rosenfeld and Mumford
all writing about you.

384
00:35:44,675 --> 00:35:47,109
All writing what I tell them to write
about you.

385
00:35:50,081 --> 00:35:52,311
Have I made a bargain with the devil?

386
00:35:53,584 --> 00:35:56,678
You knew what you wanted
even before you met me.

387
00:35:57,622 --> 00:35:59,749
You don't own me, Stieglitz.

388
00:36:00,625 --> 00:36:03,788
No. I own the photographs,

389
00:36:05,496 --> 00:36:08,829
but the spirit of the woman inside them
is yours.

390
00:36:12,069 --> 00:36:17,336
Now, come on. If I were you,
I would return to the scene of my triumph,

391
00:36:17,408 --> 00:36:21,310
and I would embrace that triumph
as if it were my own child.

392
00:36:22,046 --> 00:36:27,382
A child, who, if treated properly,
will support you well into your old age.

393
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:10,891
The woman, in an instant,

394
00:37:10,962 --> 00:37:15,490
has essentially become
a newspaper personality.

395
00:37:15,967 --> 00:37:18,959
This is unrelated to her talent and painting.

396
00:37:19,036 --> 00:37:22,802
Everybody knows her name,
and because they know her name,

397
00:37:22,873 --> 00:37:25,273
they desire to purchase her paintings.

398
00:37:26,477 --> 00:37:31,608
In this, our period of women's ascendancy,
we behold O'Keeffe's work

399
00:37:31,682 --> 00:37:37,279
flowering forth like a manifestation
of that feminine creature we first met

400
00:37:37,355 --> 00:37:39,448
in Stieglitz's photographs.

401
00:37:39,523 --> 00:37:44,222
Her great, painful, ecstatic climaxes
makes us, at last, to know that

402
00:37:44,295 --> 00:37:48,732
when women feel strongly,
they feel through the womb.

403
00:37:48,799 --> 00:37:50,960
They paint through the womb.

404
00:37:52,470 --> 00:37:54,870
Her art is gloriously female.

405
00:37:56,140 --> 00:38:01,100
There's no stroke laid by her brush
that is not ultimately feminine,

406
00:38:02,213 --> 00:38:04,909
is not curiously, arrestingly feminine.

407
00:38:06,417 --> 00:38:11,753
The essence of the very woman
is in every stroke she makes,

408
00:38:12,323 --> 00:38:14,621
every color she chooses.

409
00:38:33,477 --> 00:38:34,501
Thank you.

410
00:38:34,578 --> 00:38:36,978
I do hope Alfred remembered to change
the dinner reservation.

411
00:38:37,048 --> 00:38:39,346
I told him that Paul and I were joining you.

412
00:38:42,687 --> 00:38:44,882
- Yes.
- I'm sure you can understand.

413
00:38:44,955 --> 00:38:48,652
- Do you know who that woman is?
- She's the money. Lots of money.

414
00:38:48,726 --> 00:38:50,455
Sears, Roebuck money.

415
00:38:51,395 --> 00:38:53,295
To have your own input.

416
00:38:57,702 --> 00:39:01,069
Georgia. This is Dorothy Norman.

417
00:39:01,138 --> 00:39:05,404
Mrs. Norman is planning to invest
a substantial amount in the gallery.

418
00:39:05,910 --> 00:39:10,347
I'm so in awe of Mr. Stieglitz.
I'm in awe of you, too, Miss O'Keeffe.

419
00:39:10,414 --> 00:39:14,612
I've been an admirer
since your early works on paper.

420
00:39:14,685 --> 00:39:17,745
If I seem a little overwhelmed,

421
00:39:17,822 --> 00:39:20,791
I can't believe I'm standing in this room
with you.

422
00:39:22,626 --> 00:39:24,753
I'd do anything to help. I mean it.

423
00:39:24,829 --> 00:39:28,265
- I'd sweep the floor if you'd let me.
- Well, that sounds good.

424
00:39:31,235 --> 00:39:32,827
Well, dinner?

425
00:39:34,605 --> 00:39:39,099
Miss Norman,
it's a pleasure to see you again,

426
00:39:39,176 --> 00:39:42,703
and I hope you'll be able to come by
the gallery soon.

427
00:39:42,780 --> 00:39:45,305
Very soon. Definitely.

428
00:39:48,018 --> 00:39:49,349
Good night.

429
00:40:41,338 --> 00:40:45,206
She won't stay long.
She does have a husband to get back to.

430
00:40:45,276 --> 00:40:47,005
You'd never know it.

431
00:40:55,719 --> 00:40:58,882
When she goes, so will your migraine.

432
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:06,454
I think we should thank
the generous Mr. Norman

433
00:41:06,530 --> 00:41:10,660
for affording us the glorious opportunity
of spending this week with Mrs. Norman.

434
00:41:10,734 --> 00:41:13,532
He doesn't mind. We have an understanding.

435
00:41:16,106 --> 00:41:18,734
- Very modern.
- I like to think so.

436
00:41:19,977 --> 00:41:21,376
One heart.

437
00:41:22,813 --> 00:41:24,337
And,

438
00:41:25,549 --> 00:41:27,744
tell me, do the two of you still screw?

439
00:41:28,385 --> 00:41:31,479
- Alfred. For God's sake.
- I'm sorry, Becca.

440
00:41:32,356 --> 00:41:36,292
Would you prefer I used
another euphemism?

441
00:41:36,827 --> 00:41:40,456
No, dear.
"Screw" is a good word, an honest word.

442
00:41:40,931 --> 00:41:42,421
Two diamonds.

443
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:45,765
Yes, we do screw on occasion.

444
00:41:46,370 --> 00:41:49,066
- Christmas and Easter?
- And birthdays.

445
00:41:51,041 --> 00:41:52,474
Two hearts.

446
00:41:53,744 --> 00:41:56,770
So, then, in the meantime, you're free
to look for love anywhere you'd like.

447
00:41:56,847 --> 00:41:58,371
So to speak.

448
00:41:58,449 --> 00:41:59,780
Three of diamonds.

449
00:42:02,853 --> 00:42:05,947
Well, there you are, my love.

450
00:42:06,790 --> 00:42:11,159
- The formula for the perfect marriage.
- Quite right, quite right.

451
00:42:13,063 --> 00:42:16,897
Love nurtures a marriage,
whether it is from within or without.

452
00:42:19,970 --> 00:42:23,963
You and Mr. Norman are quite right.
Stay married. Do not divorce.

453
00:42:25,242 --> 00:42:28,143
And nurture the beast with love,

454
00:42:29,914 --> 00:42:33,441
whenever and wherever you can find it.

455
00:42:45,062 --> 00:42:46,393
- Pass?
- Pass.

456
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:06,472
My father ran Buffalo Bill's Wild West Show.

457
00:43:06,550 --> 00:43:09,747
I grew up with every kind of rude
and ill-mannered cowboy and Indian,

458
00:43:09,820 --> 00:43:10,946
and I can safely say

459
00:43:11,021 --> 00:43:13,581
your husband's behavior
is worse than any of them.

460
00:43:13,657 --> 00:43:17,923
- You're right.
- So, say something to him. Pick a fight.

461
00:43:19,563 --> 00:43:22,498
He wouldn't have the faintest idea
what I was talking about.

462
00:43:23,300 --> 00:43:25,530
He doesn't know what he's doing
or what's happening to him.

463
00:43:25,603 --> 00:43:28,834
- Well, then he's an idiot.
- Yes, he is.

464
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:31,730
And I love him,

465
00:43:32,676 --> 00:43:36,271
even when I can't stand the sight of him
or the thought of him with another woman.

466
00:43:40,084 --> 00:43:44,987
- What are you gonna do about Mrs. Norman?
- I may just have to shoot her.

467
00:43:48,525 --> 00:43:52,552
She adores him,
and that's what he really wants.

468
00:43:53,998 --> 00:43:55,898
Someone who lives only for him,

469
00:43:55,966 --> 00:43:59,129
a little seed that he can plant
and nurture and care for and...

470
00:44:02,940 --> 00:44:05,135
Is that what you were to him?

471
00:44:07,811 --> 00:44:12,180
Yes, I was a little plant
that he watered and weeded

472
00:44:12,249 --> 00:44:18,745
and dug around until he lost interest in me
because I grew out of his shadow.

473
00:45:33,931 --> 00:45:39,597
- It's so dark. Where are we?
- Go back to sleep. We're almost there.

474
00:45:41,672 --> 00:45:45,574
- You're sure Mabel won't mind?
- She insisted I bring you.

475
00:45:46,076 --> 00:45:48,306
She knows what you've been going through.

476
00:45:48,378 --> 00:45:51,347
- I'll be fine.
- Of course you will.

477
00:45:52,950 --> 00:45:57,887
- I hurt so much.
- I know. Here.

478
00:46:03,627 --> 00:46:08,462
You'll love it in Taos.
It's like being on the moon.

479
00:47:11,695 --> 00:47:14,892
I'm gonna get you out of these wet things
and into bed, Georgia.

480
00:47:34,651 --> 00:47:38,314
I know. I know it hurts, Georgia.

481
00:49:23,860 --> 00:49:25,020
Hello.

482
00:49:39,176 --> 00:49:42,907
I don't know why I'm speaking Spanish
to you. You're not Spanish, are you?

483
00:49:42,980 --> 00:49:45,574
But I don't know any Indian language.

484
00:49:49,252 --> 00:49:51,846
English? Do you speak English?

485
00:49:53,523 --> 00:49:56,219
Yes, Ms. O'Keeffe. I do speak English.

486
00:49:56,927 --> 00:50:01,455
Poquito espanol, couple of Hopi dialects,
and my French is pretty good.

487
00:50:03,734 --> 00:50:06,999
What are you doing way out here
without your shoes?

488
00:50:07,971 --> 00:50:12,340
I don't know.
I just woke up, wandered out, got lost.

489
00:50:13,477 --> 00:50:14,501
Come on.

490
00:50:15,312 --> 00:50:18,281
I'll give you a lift back.
Mabel will be worried.

491
00:50:22,185 --> 00:50:25,416
Good God, I thought we'd lost you already.

492
00:50:25,856 --> 00:50:29,656
You should be in bed, resting, recuperating.

493
00:50:31,695 --> 00:50:34,459
I'm fine, Mabel.
I'm fine thanks to your friend.

494
00:50:34,965 --> 00:50:39,095
He's not a friend, Georgia.
He's a husband, Tony Luhan.

495
00:50:39,169 --> 00:50:42,627
That makes me Mabel Evans Dodge Stern
Luhan. That's four, isn't it?

496
00:50:42,739 --> 00:50:45,207
Congratulations. The collection is growing.

497
00:50:45,275 --> 00:50:47,903
Oh, my dear,
one can't be this far out into the wilderness

498
00:50:47,978 --> 00:50:51,414
without a little pokey-poke every now
and then. Good for the skin,

499
00:50:51,481 --> 00:50:55,042
and the disposition.
Now, I want you back in bed.

500
00:50:56,753 --> 00:51:00,883
I want you good and rested. We're having
guests tonight. Dinner and dancing.

501
00:51:00,957 --> 00:51:05,758
- I don't feel like dancing, Mabel.
- Oh, my dear. Dancing is a euphemism.

502
00:51:26,316 --> 00:51:28,307
What does the dance mean?

503
00:51:30,187 --> 00:51:32,883
It means that you're one with nature.

504
00:51:34,458 --> 00:51:39,623
With the earth and sky, and the bricks,
and the river.

505
00:51:41,031 --> 00:51:43,158
And the beasts in the field.

506
00:51:43,767 --> 00:51:48,898
Not better or worse, not different,
not separate,

507
00:51:50,774 --> 00:51:52,401
but all the same.

508
00:51:55,445 --> 00:51:58,778
See, in the dancing, Ms. O'Keeffe, it means...

509
00:52:01,118 --> 00:52:04,178
It means that you are the earth and sky.

510
00:52:06,723 --> 00:52:07,781
Yes.

511
00:52:14,364 --> 00:52:19,597
I'd really like to learn how to drive.
Do you think you could teach me?

512
00:52:24,341 --> 00:52:27,868
Yes, Ms. O'Keeffe. Of course.

513
00:52:29,312 --> 00:52:30,745
Thank you, Mr. Luhan.

514
00:52:36,553 --> 00:52:41,149
Dear Ms. O'Keeffe,
I'm planning a small group show in the fall,

515
00:52:41,224 --> 00:52:45,991
and I sincerely hope that you will honor me
with more of your flower paintings.

516
00:52:47,564 --> 00:52:49,623
I have denigrated them in the past,

517
00:52:49,699 --> 00:52:53,635
but clearly I was out of step with what
the buyers are buying.

518
00:52:53,703 --> 00:52:58,504
We could sell 100 of them were you to find
the time and the inclination.

519
00:53:00,710 --> 00:53:07,411
The show cannot go on without you,
and I'm afraid I myself cannot, either.

520
00:53:08,652 --> 00:53:11,018
The thought of you
so many miles away from me

521
00:53:11,087 --> 00:53:17,754
makes me sadder than you would imagine.
I am terribly eager to make a fresh go of it.

522
00:53:19,196 --> 00:53:22,757
As ever, your most humble husband,
Mr. Stieglitz.

523
00:53:26,570 --> 00:53:30,836
- What's that mountain out there?
- They call it the Pedernal.

524
00:53:31,575 --> 00:53:34,806
- We call it...
- It looks small.

525
00:53:36,146 --> 00:53:37,408
It's not.

526
00:53:38,181 --> 00:53:41,981
- Well, get closer. Can you get closer?
- Yeah.

527
00:53:54,064 --> 00:53:57,625
- This is one crazy woman.
- Yes.

528
00:54:00,370 --> 00:54:04,136
- It must be 120 degrees.
- Want some water?

529
00:54:04,874 --> 00:54:06,102
God, no.

530
00:54:08,245 --> 00:54:12,614
- How about some tequila?
- Now you're talking.

531
00:54:21,524 --> 00:54:23,958
- You all right?
- Yes.

532
00:54:24,628 --> 00:54:29,065
Another... Another letter from Stieglitz.
Gilled with remorse, I imagine.

533
00:54:30,133 --> 00:54:33,830
- Put it with the rest of them.
- Must be dozens.

534
00:54:34,738 --> 00:54:38,139
- I'll read them later.
- Good girl.

535
00:54:38,675 --> 00:54:43,544
Let go of New York. Let go of everything.
That's the only way.

536
00:54:44,214 --> 00:54:48,446
No ties that bind. No... No binds at all.

537
00:54:53,356 --> 00:54:56,519
It's been almost a year since I wore a girdle.

538
00:54:57,394 --> 00:55:00,761
- You're drunk.
- No, no. It's true. It's true.

539
00:55:03,066 --> 00:55:06,797
- It's good to see you like this.
- Like what?

540
00:55:07,637 --> 00:55:09,730
Happy, relaxed.

541
00:55:11,274 --> 00:55:16,211
I love it here. Heaven help me.
I'm glad I'm here.

542
00:55:24,921 --> 00:55:27,651
Well, yeah. You want to play like that?

543
00:55:28,358 --> 00:55:31,885
If you want to play like that,
then I want to play, too.

544
00:55:52,148 --> 00:55:53,945
Oh, no! Oh, no.

545
00:55:58,154 --> 00:56:01,555
All right. Forward. I'll get it this time.

546
00:56:09,632 --> 00:56:11,156
That was easy.

547
00:56:29,319 --> 00:56:32,152
- You want to know the truth?
- I sure do.

548
00:56:34,891 --> 00:56:37,416
I've never felt at home in the East.

549
00:56:39,963 --> 00:56:44,127
- What about Stieglitz?
- I don't know.

550
00:56:46,970 --> 00:56:50,736
I can't leave him
without cutting half my heart away,

551
00:56:51,841 --> 00:56:53,638
but I know I belong here.

552
00:56:55,145 --> 00:56:59,548
My head's filling up with pictures
just waiting to jump onto the canvas.

553
00:56:59,616 --> 00:57:01,481
I mean, I just... I look

554
00:57:03,253 --> 00:57:05,778
at the hills and the sky and I just...

555
00:57:06,055 --> 00:57:09,388
I think half your work's done for you,
isn't it?

556
00:57:14,697 --> 00:57:17,222
I told Tony to order us our own car.

557
00:57:20,003 --> 00:57:22,437
It's a Model T, and it costs $670,

558
00:57:22,505 --> 00:57:27,943
but it has removable seats and a high roof,
and I can paint right inside.

559
00:57:29,612 --> 00:57:33,776
I'd imagine I could get a canvas,
I don't know, 30 by 40 inches in the back.

560
00:57:36,486 --> 00:57:40,217
It'd keep me out of the heat and the cold,
don't you think?

561
00:57:46,629 --> 00:57:48,620
She's not read them? She's not read them?

562
00:57:49,566 --> 00:57:51,431
"I haven't had time to read them."

563
00:57:51,501 --> 00:57:55,995
What in God's name is she thinking?
I must have written her 100 letters!

564
00:57:56,072 --> 00:58:02,102
Listen to this, "l found the most wonderful
hills driving through the Navajo country."

565
00:58:03,213 --> 00:58:07,172
She's driving! Georgia's driving
a car into savage territories.

566
00:58:07,250 --> 00:58:08,478
Go to bed, Alfred.

567
00:58:08,551 --> 00:58:13,955
With nobody but some Indian
and good-for-nothing Becca Strand.

568
00:58:14,524 --> 00:58:17,118
I know her father consorted
with Wild Bill Hickok.

569
00:58:17,193 --> 00:58:20,390
Buffalo Bill, Alfred.
Not Wild Bill, Buffalo Bill.

570
00:58:20,964 --> 00:58:24,297
"Mabel's house is full of
the most wonderful assortment of people."

571
00:58:24,367 --> 00:58:27,302
Wonderful, wonderful!
Everything's wonderful!

572
00:58:28,938 --> 00:58:32,135
"Last week Jean Toomer arrived,
another woman in tow,

573
00:58:32,208 --> 00:58:34,438
"looking as handsome as ever."

574
00:58:36,212 --> 00:58:38,646
Here we are. "ln the heat of the afternoon,

575
00:58:38,715 --> 00:58:42,583
"we all lie out naked under the sun
and bake."

576
00:58:43,319 --> 00:58:45,287
What, she has Jean Toomer out there?

577
00:58:45,355 --> 00:58:50,292
I mean, they're all lying naked under the sun,
under the stars.

578
00:58:51,694 --> 00:58:53,685
You don't have to tell me what's going on.
I can read it.

579
00:58:53,763 --> 00:58:55,822
I can read between the lines.

580
00:58:55,899 --> 00:58:58,732
"Jean Toomer is steeped in
the philosophies of Gurdjieff

581
00:58:58,801 --> 00:59:01,827
"and has been showing me
the most curious exercises."

582
00:59:01,905 --> 00:59:03,532
I bet he has.

583
00:59:03,606 --> 00:59:07,042
"He has been demonstrating something
called the fourth way of..."

584
00:59:07,110 --> 00:59:10,876
She's a married woman, for God's sake!
She has a home! She has a husband!

585
00:59:10,947 --> 00:59:13,780
She's abandoned all civilized behavior?

586
00:59:14,083 --> 00:59:17,018
Yes, it's very wrong of her.
Now come to bed.

587
00:59:17,086 --> 00:59:18,849
When she's not cavorting with the natives,

588
00:59:18,922 --> 00:59:22,255
she's snuggling up to
the black prince of Harlem.

589
00:59:22,692 --> 00:59:26,890
Young and handsome. Young!
Unlike some of us.

590
00:59:26,963 --> 00:59:30,592
God help it. Bastard! Let it all go!

591
00:59:32,535 --> 00:59:35,333
Let it all go! I don't need that!

592
00:59:35,972 --> 00:59:38,566
Work. It's what keeps her away.

593
00:59:38,641 --> 00:59:42,771
God, always working with the gallery,
and I never see her.

594
00:59:42,845 --> 00:59:45,780
So, when she's here, I never see her.
So she goes away.

595
00:59:45,848 --> 00:59:49,284
She goes... I'm no good for her.

596
00:59:52,889 --> 00:59:56,381
I want her to come home.

597
00:59:56,459 --> 01:00:00,896
I want her just to come home.

598
01:00:07,637 --> 01:00:08,831
- Oh, God.
- What is it?

599
01:00:09,539 --> 01:00:10,801
Heart...

600
01:00:36,599 --> 01:00:38,191
Georgia, listen.

601
01:00:39,936 --> 01:00:42,905
- We got a telegram.
- It's Alfred.

602
01:01:24,514 --> 01:01:26,311
Hello, Mr. Stieglitz.

603
01:01:45,935 --> 01:01:47,630
You've gotten sun.

604
01:02:16,532 --> 01:02:19,365
That's awful. Enough, enough.

605
01:02:19,435 --> 01:02:24,304
I followed these filthy directions to
the letter. You could at least be grateful.

606
01:02:27,343 --> 01:02:29,243
You know, I missed you.

607
01:02:31,514 --> 01:02:35,883
- Mr. Stieglitz, you're a terrible liar.
- Seriously, Ms. O'Keeffe.

608
01:02:37,954 --> 01:02:41,253
- I've been very lonely without you.
- Did you suffer?

609
01:02:41,457 --> 01:02:43,322
- You know I did.
- Good.

610
01:02:48,464 --> 01:02:49,954
Come sit down.

611
01:03:04,580 --> 01:03:06,514
- Georgia...
- Don't ask me that.

612
01:03:06,582 --> 01:03:08,880
No, listen to me. Listen to me.

613
01:03:11,320 --> 01:03:15,188
How many more summers do we have?
How many?

614
01:03:18,361 --> 01:03:19,885
Don't go back.

615
01:03:22,965 --> 01:03:25,297
I'll make you happy. I promise.

616
01:03:27,436 --> 01:03:28,630
I will.

617
01:03:42,351 --> 01:03:44,012
You terrible man.

618
01:03:48,858 --> 01:03:52,760
I love this one. See how it frames the sky?

619
01:04:00,670 --> 01:04:04,504
And here's a great fragment.
Don't need to paint the whole thing.

620
01:04:05,541 --> 01:04:09,773
Select, eliminate. Thank you, Mr. Stieglitz.

621
01:04:14,917 --> 01:04:17,215
Don't you find it a bit creepy?

622
01:04:18,554 --> 01:04:23,423
- Intimations of mortality and all that?
- Well, to me, they're very lively things.

623
01:04:24,594 --> 01:04:28,553
I prefer the bones
to the real cows always swishing their tails.

624
01:04:28,998 --> 01:04:30,795
And they don't smell.

625
01:05:23,052 --> 01:05:25,612
Wrap yourself up,
'cause it's very cold out there.

626
01:05:25,688 --> 01:05:29,146
Before you get a chill, all right?
I'll see you later.

627
01:05:30,026 --> 01:05:32,790
It's very nice to see you again, Ms. O'Keeffe.

628
01:05:35,231 --> 01:05:37,222
Did you have a nice trip?

629
01:05:40,036 --> 01:05:43,233
I'll see you later, Dorothy.
See you at the gallery.

630
01:05:51,681 --> 01:05:55,447
- Did you have to bring her here?
- Georgia...

631
01:05:57,954 --> 01:05:59,945
What am I supposed to do?

632
01:06:01,057 --> 01:06:04,356
You're off gallivanting in the desert
half the time.

633
01:06:05,227 --> 01:06:08,219
I can't do everything by myself. I need help.

634
01:06:11,200 --> 01:06:14,601
Dorothy Norman is
the largest single investor in the gallery.

635
01:06:14,670 --> 01:06:17,537
Without her, we wouldn't have all of this.

636
01:06:21,310 --> 01:06:26,043
Dearest Mabel, how I miss you and Tony
and life in Taos.

637
01:06:26,782 --> 01:06:30,946
The night I left, the moonlight over
the Glorieta was like a dream.

638
01:06:31,020 --> 01:06:35,821
The sagebrush white and frosty,
the river black and mysterious.

639
01:06:36,258 --> 01:06:39,659
I long to return,
but I have taken a commission

640
01:06:39,729 --> 01:06:42,823
which will keep me in New York
for several more months.

641
01:06:42,898 --> 01:06:46,231
I am to paint a wall for
the Radio City Music Hall,

642
01:06:46,302 --> 01:06:50,033
but one difficulty after another has kept me
from starting.

643
01:06:50,406 --> 01:06:54,172
The whole affair is beginning to seem more
like burden than opportunity,

644
01:06:54,243 --> 01:06:58,612
but there is something in me
that must finish jobs once started,

645
01:06:58,681 --> 01:07:01,844
so I will have to keep missing you
for that much longer

646
01:07:01,917 --> 01:07:07,514
and hurry back to the sky and the mountains
and the sun when my work is over.

647
01:07:07,890 --> 01:07:13,328
My greetings to your horizon.
As ever, Georgia.

648
01:07:14,330 --> 01:07:16,355
It's a bathroom, for God's sake! It's a toilet!

649
01:07:16,432 --> 01:07:20,334
No, it's the ladies' lounge,
and it's twice the size of this apartment.

650
01:07:20,403 --> 01:07:23,895
Georgia O'Keeffe is gonna paint the walls of
a pissoir over my dead body!

651
01:07:23,973 --> 01:07:25,338
Well, then, fine.
If that's the way you want it...

652
01:07:25,408 --> 01:07:27,740
- I'm gonna call Mr. Deskey...
- No, no, you will not.

653
01:07:27,810 --> 01:07:29,539
You are not calling Mr. Deskey.

654
01:07:31,147 --> 01:07:32,910
- Behind my back.
- You do not need to call anybody.

655
01:07:32,982 --> 01:07:34,643
Behind my back.
I have to read about it in the newspaper?

656
01:07:34,717 --> 01:07:37,049
- I have already agreed.
- To what?

657
01:07:37,119 --> 01:07:38,984
- That's my business.
- For how much?

658
01:07:39,055 --> 01:07:40,249
For how much? Come on.
Are you afraid to tell me?

659
01:07:40,322 --> 01:07:41,653
- No, I am not afraid to tell you.
- Well, tell me.

660
01:07:41,724 --> 01:07:44,056
I am receiving $1,500 and it is my business!

661
01:07:44,126 --> 01:07:48,688
I got you $28,000 for a lousy bunch
of calla lilies, for God's sake!

662
01:07:48,764 --> 01:07:51,426
I could have got you just as much
for your stinking wall!

663
01:07:51,500 --> 01:07:53,297
Who negotiated this?

664
01:07:53,369 --> 01:07:56,770
It's the biggest single drop in value
since the Wall Street crash!

665
01:07:56,839 --> 01:07:58,431
You have no idea
what damage you're doing to yourself!

666
01:07:58,507 --> 01:08:00,134
I will not be spoken to as if I'm a child.

667
01:08:00,209 --> 01:08:01,904
But you're behaving like a child!

668
01:08:01,977 --> 01:08:04,878
You have no idea what work I've done
to make something of you,

669
01:08:04,947 --> 01:08:06,437
and you piss it away
on a room full of toilets.

670
01:08:06,515 --> 01:08:08,176
- Make something of me?
- Yes!

671
01:08:08,250 --> 01:08:09,581
- Make something of me?
- Yes!

672
01:08:09,652 --> 01:08:11,847
I made something of myself!

673
01:08:11,921 --> 01:08:15,288
And I will continue to make something
of myself with or without you!

674
01:08:15,357 --> 01:08:17,188
Go on, go on, then! Let's see how you do!

675
01:08:17,259 --> 01:08:20,057
Yes, 'cause you think that
I can do nothing without you!

676
01:08:20,129 --> 01:08:23,792
You think that I am nothing without you!
Look at me!

677
01:08:23,866 --> 01:08:25,834
Look at me! I am something!

678
01:08:25,901 --> 01:08:28,392
And I will still be something
when you're dead and buried

679
01:08:28,471 --> 01:08:31,440
and in the grave and out of my life forever!

680
01:08:38,380 --> 01:08:40,473
- Yeah.
- Alfred, I didn't mean that.

681
01:08:40,549 --> 01:08:43,347
- No, you're right.
- I didn't mean it. I promise.

682
01:08:43,419 --> 01:08:45,284
- You'll be all right.
- I promise I didn't mean it.

683
01:08:45,354 --> 01:08:50,053
You'll still be here when all the things
I've worked for will be gone, disappeared.

684
01:08:50,126 --> 01:08:51,923
- I didn't mean it.
- Just rocks in the desert.

685
01:08:51,994 --> 01:08:55,691
No, no. It's not true. I didn't mean it.
Honest, I didn't.

686
01:08:57,399 --> 01:08:59,799
What's the matter? What's wrong?

687
01:09:01,203 --> 01:09:03,068
What is it? Alfred?

688
01:09:03,739 --> 01:09:07,732
- Cramps. It's been happening.
- What? Tell me, what's been happening?

689
01:09:08,344 --> 01:09:11,609
My brother says sympathy cramps
for Dorothy.

690
01:09:12,114 --> 01:09:14,480
- The pregnancy.
- What pregnancy?

691
01:09:14,884 --> 01:09:18,513
Dorothy, she's pregnant again, and I feel it.

692
01:09:19,121 --> 01:09:23,182
- You feel it? You feel what?
- Her pain. I swear I do.

693
01:09:24,827 --> 01:09:26,294
- Georgia, I'm scared.
- For God's sake.

694
01:09:26,362 --> 01:09:27,727
- What if it means...
- For God's sake.

695
01:09:27,796 --> 01:09:30,196
What if it means the child's gonna be mine?
What do I do then?

696
01:09:30,266 --> 01:09:31,528
Oh, God.

697
01:09:33,002 --> 01:09:34,936
- What do I do?
- Oh, you

698
01:09:36,338 --> 01:09:40,434
stupid, stupid man! You child!
You reckless, unbearable idiot!

699
01:09:40,509 --> 01:09:46,277
I could kill you. I swear I could strangle
the breath out of you with my bare hands.

700
01:09:58,661 --> 01:10:02,995
Ms. O'Keeffe, how's it going down here?
Everything all right?

701
01:12:40,589 --> 01:12:44,320
- Where is she?
- Go sit down for a moment, Alfred.

702
01:12:44,893 --> 01:12:46,292
I don't want to sit down.
I want to see Georgia.

703
01:12:46,362 --> 01:12:48,023
- You're not gonna see her.
- Why?

704
01:12:48,097 --> 01:12:50,622
- What's the matter?
- I'm not gonna let you see her.

705
01:12:50,699 --> 01:12:52,496
Are you out of your mind?

706
01:12:52,568 --> 01:12:55,765
You're a dangerous man, Alfred.
You have no idea what you are doing.

707
01:12:55,838 --> 01:12:58,033
- What am I doing?
- You're killing her.

708
01:12:58,107 --> 01:13:02,601
If you were holding a pillow over her face,
you couldn't be more culpable.

709
01:13:03,078 --> 01:13:04,943
- But I love her.
- Do you?

710
01:13:05,781 --> 01:13:06,907
She's my wife.

711
01:13:06,982 --> 01:13:10,076
Gather had his own women,
and I haven't been the perfect husband,

712
01:13:10,152 --> 01:13:13,747
but we were never unkind to our women.
We were never cruel as you are.

713
01:13:13,822 --> 01:13:16,552
Your cruelty is vicious, Alfred.
It cuts like a knife.

714
01:13:16,625 --> 01:13:18,252
She's the one who keeps leaving me.
Don't forget that.

715
01:13:18,327 --> 01:13:20,761
And now because you can't control her,
you want to destroy her.

716
01:13:20,829 --> 01:13:24,765
Christ Almighty, I would leave you myself.
You're weak and a coward and a bully!

717
01:13:24,833 --> 01:13:28,234
- You don't understand.
- This is my hospital and my patient,

718
01:13:28,303 --> 01:13:31,329
and you are forbidden access to her.
Good day.

719
01:13:34,543 --> 01:13:36,340
We're brothers, for God's sake.

720
01:13:36,412 --> 01:13:39,609
And of that fact I can only say
that I am ashamed.

721
01:14:46,548 --> 01:14:47,845
Give minutes.

722
01:14:51,954 --> 01:14:55,014
Well, at last.

723
01:15:00,329 --> 01:15:03,958
You know, I wanted to come sooner,
but Lee wouldn't let me.

724
01:15:04,032 --> 01:15:09,265
Really. He was convinced I'd do more harm
than good.

725
01:15:09,938 --> 01:15:13,374
So, I humored him.

726
01:15:17,613 --> 01:15:20,844
Still, I didn't think you'd be in here this long.

727
01:15:21,216 --> 01:15:22,843
It's long enough.

728
01:15:24,520 --> 01:15:28,547
I don't know how you can stand it.
Not much to look at.

729
01:15:34,663 --> 01:15:37,928
So, now,

730
01:15:40,702 --> 01:15:43,637
I started putting together the annual show.

731
01:15:45,941 --> 01:15:48,171
I think it's very good timing.

732
01:15:48,744 --> 01:15:52,805
Everybody knows about your, you know,
emotional difficulties.

733
01:15:54,883 --> 01:15:59,843
There's a lot of sympathy for you.
I think we'll do very well.

734
01:16:01,590 --> 01:16:07,995
I picked mostly the white stuff,
the shells, the purple callas,

735
01:16:09,231 --> 01:16:12,064
that weed, the Jimsonweed,

736
01:16:13,302 --> 01:16:17,466
and then some of the white abstractions.

737
01:16:19,408 --> 01:16:22,206
There's a market for white at the moment.

738
01:16:22,911 --> 01:16:26,642
Some Chinese hogwash about yin and yang,

739
01:16:26,715 --> 01:16:31,675
and earth and sky, masculine, feminine,
you know.

740
01:16:33,956 --> 01:16:36,686
So, it's perfect timing. It's good for you.

741
01:16:36,758 --> 01:16:38,885
And good for me.

742
01:16:41,530 --> 01:16:43,122
What do you say?

743
01:16:51,773 --> 01:16:54,298
All right, I'll take that as a yes.

744
01:16:58,013 --> 01:17:02,507
So, now, you just get yourself better,

745
01:17:02,918 --> 01:17:06,911
I'll hang the show,
and I'll have it up when you get out of here.

746
01:17:10,125 --> 01:17:15,961
Give the press something to write about.
Rising from the ashes, blah, blah, blah.

747
01:17:20,369 --> 01:17:21,563
Well...

748
01:17:25,173 --> 01:17:26,970
I better say goodbye.

749
01:17:40,389 --> 01:17:41,754
Bye, then.

750
01:17:49,097 --> 01:17:50,291
Right.

751
01:18:10,919 --> 01:18:13,854
- How is she?
- She's fine. Fine.

752
01:18:15,457 --> 01:18:19,154
She loved the idea of the show.
She loved the flowers, too.

753
01:18:20,162 --> 01:18:22,653
It's gonna be so great to get going again.

754
01:18:23,298 --> 01:18:26,699
We're a team, you see? Always were.
We think the same.

755
01:18:27,436 --> 01:18:29,301
Well, we're a marriage.

756
01:18:29,771 --> 01:18:33,832
O'Keeffe and Stieglitz.
Always was, always will be.

757
01:18:34,142 --> 01:18:36,406
Yes, it's a marriage.

758
01:18:39,214 --> 01:18:43,412
It's taken me nearly 18 months to begin
to try to paint again.

759
01:18:45,153 --> 01:18:50,352
In this time, so many things have turned
over in me and come out clear to me.

760
01:18:52,027 --> 01:18:58,865
I feel like a reed blown about by the winds
of my habits, my affections, things that I am.

761
01:18:59,935 --> 01:19:04,133
And I find myself moving more and more
to a kind of aloneness.

762
01:19:05,373 --> 01:19:09,707
Not because I wish it so,
but because there seems no other way.

763
01:19:10,946 --> 01:19:13,744
No other way if I am to be what I need to be.

764
01:19:15,417 --> 01:19:19,114
I must be apart now. I see that now.

765
01:19:21,790 --> 01:19:24,987
It's clear to me
that we cannot meet each other's needs,

766
01:19:25,060 --> 01:19:28,518
and I must admit
that there is some strange sense of relief

767
01:19:28,597 --> 01:19:33,261
that you have someone else to care for you
in a way that is impossible for me.

768
01:19:36,138 --> 01:19:42,168
I still miss you terribly even though I'm glad
to be gone, to be alone.

769
01:20:22,317 --> 01:20:23,511
Alfred?

770
01:20:35,897 --> 01:20:38,422
So, what do you think?

771
01:20:40,869 --> 01:20:44,669
Very good.
This one is upside down, but I like it.

772
01:20:54,516 --> 01:20:56,507
Show didn't do very well.

773
01:20:57,919 --> 01:21:01,320
But we did sell one painting,
irony of ironies,

774
01:21:02,324 --> 01:21:04,758
to the Metropolitan Museum of Art.

775
01:21:09,764 --> 01:21:15,066
An O'Keeffe at the Metropolitan.
What do you say to that?

776
01:21:17,639 --> 01:21:21,598
Well... Well, that's wonderful.

777
01:21:25,180 --> 01:21:27,239
I wanted to surprise you.

778
01:21:29,251 --> 01:21:32,414
An American woman at the Metropolitan.

779
01:21:34,256 --> 01:21:38,693
- Do you see what we've achieved?
- Yes, I do see.

780
01:21:41,529 --> 01:21:43,326
Got another surprise for you.

781
01:21:43,765 --> 01:21:47,997
I found you a studio at the Shelton
just upstairs from the apartment.

782
01:21:48,303 --> 01:21:51,067
I put a deposit on it. It's all yours.

783
01:21:51,139 --> 01:21:55,974
And if you ever feel like seeing me,
I'll be handy, just downstairs, so to speak.

784
01:21:57,112 --> 01:22:01,549
I might use a corner of it for myself,
but I won't disturb you or your privacy.

785
01:22:01,950 --> 01:22:04,248
- Alfred...
- No, no, no, no, no, no.

786
01:22:04,319 --> 01:22:06,310
It's fine. It's fine. We can afford it.

787
01:22:06,388 --> 01:22:09,289
Alfred, listen to me.

788
01:22:13,461 --> 01:22:14,860
I'm leaving.

789
01:22:15,931 --> 01:22:17,762
But you've only just arrived.

790
01:22:17,832 --> 01:22:23,532
I'm on the train for Chicago and then
I'm changing this afternoon for New Mexico,

791
01:22:23,939 --> 01:22:26,430
and I wanted to come
and say goodbye to you.

792
01:22:26,508 --> 01:22:29,807
- Too fast.
- I owe you so much.

793
01:22:29,878 --> 01:22:31,709
I don't want your gratitude!

794
01:22:32,981 --> 01:22:36,542
But I am grateful, despite everything.

795
01:22:43,058 --> 01:22:44,855
Lee thinks I'm cruel.

796
01:22:47,195 --> 01:22:49,891
But I'm not, not here, not in my heart.

797
01:22:50,598 --> 01:22:54,159
No. Not in your heart.

798
01:22:55,637 --> 01:22:57,036
Nor in mine.

799
01:22:58,373 --> 01:22:59,863
In my heart,

800
01:23:02,110 --> 01:23:06,069
I have only loved you,
and I'll love you forever.

801
01:23:06,581 --> 01:23:09,049
But, but, but. I hear a but coming.

802
01:23:09,117 --> 01:23:11,915
Yes. But I have to leave.

803
01:23:15,457 --> 01:23:19,723
- You won't be happy without me, you know.
- I know. I'll be miserable.

804
01:23:21,997 --> 01:23:24,693
I know I'm not your better half, but...

805
01:23:28,103 --> 01:23:30,663
I am half of you, more than half.

806
01:23:33,675 --> 01:23:35,040
Much more.

807
01:23:36,978 --> 01:23:41,312
My life, my work, everything.

808
01:23:45,120 --> 01:23:48,487
It's yours. It's all yours.

809
01:23:53,061 --> 01:23:57,191
But you see, that's why I have to leave.

810
01:23:57,265 --> 01:24:00,200
I have to take what's yours and make it mine.

811
01:24:02,003 --> 01:24:07,236
- Please let me go, Mr. Stieglitz. Please.
- All right, all right, all right. You go. Go.

812
01:24:08,576 --> 01:24:10,339
But you'll be back.

813
01:24:12,180 --> 01:24:14,808
- Will l?
- We're not finished yet.

814
01:24:15,817 --> 01:24:17,682
Not yet, Ms. O'Keeffe.

815
01:24:18,820 --> 01:24:22,119
But for now, you go. Go.
Go west, young woman. Go west.

816
01:24:23,324 --> 01:24:26,384
I'll be here. I'll be waiting.

817
01:24:37,005 --> 01:24:39,872
- Alfred...
- Go, go, go, go.

818
01:24:49,117 --> 01:24:52,450
Dear Ms. O'Keeffe, what you say is all true.

819
01:24:53,288 --> 01:24:58,817
You have found yourself, are yourself,
all health and life as I wished for you.

820
01:25:00,728 --> 01:25:03,094
I have succeeded, and so have you.

821
01:25:03,665 --> 01:25:08,159
But we have lost a part of each other.
That's the irony of our lives.

822
01:25:11,473 --> 01:25:14,135
I love you, Georgia. Don't you know it?

823
01:25:16,511 --> 01:25:21,175
I'd like to die in your arms.
That's my one great wish.

824
01:25:28,490 --> 01:25:31,391
I was in the supermarket
in Espanola buying groceries

825
01:25:31,459 --> 01:25:34,917
when the news came to me
that he had suffered a stroke.

826
01:25:35,563 --> 01:25:37,929
I went straight to the airport
from the checkout counter,

827
01:25:37,999 --> 01:25:41,059
arrived in time to sit with him until the end.

828
01:25:45,373 --> 01:25:50,640
I can still see to the end of my arm,
so I can still work.

829
01:25:52,180 --> 01:25:54,341
But the world is a blur now.

830
01:25:55,283 --> 01:26:00,084
I see it mostly from memory,
and I can still feel it.

831
01:26:01,156 --> 01:26:05,183
I can still feel the light. Can you feel that?

832
01:26:09,030 --> 01:26:12,295
So much to do, so much to paint.

833
01:26:13,101 --> 01:26:18,266
You know, sometimes when I get an idea
for a picture, I think, "How ordinary.

834
01:26:18,339 --> 01:26:21,467
"Why should I paint some old rock,
some old hill,

835
01:26:21,543 --> 01:26:24,068
"or flower that I can barely see anymore?

836
01:26:24,145 --> 01:26:26,477
"Why not go for a walk instead?"

837
01:26:27,549 --> 01:26:33,454
But then I realize that to someone else,
it may not seem ordinary at all.

838
01:26:35,924 --> 01:26:38,825
So I do it as best I can.

839
01:26:42,197 --> 01:26:48,534
And when it's done, I think, "Now,
what would Mr. Stieglitz think of this?"

840
01:26:49,204 --> 01:26:53,937
Because, the truth is,
I would rather have him like something,

841
01:26:54,342 --> 01:26:59,109
anything, I had done
more than anyone else I know.
