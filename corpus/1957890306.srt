1
00:01:00,394 --> 00:01:01,161
- Oh look,

2
00:01:05,098 --> 00:01:08,536
your holdings with
Vanguard have gone up,

3
00:01:10,237 --> 00:01:13,708
they're very good,
actually up 15%,

4
00:01:13,741 --> 00:01:16,010
and they're actually,

5
00:01:16,044 --> 00:01:18,980
they're talking
about a bull market

6
00:01:20,515 --> 00:01:23,751
coming towards the
end of the year, so,

7
00:01:25,152 --> 00:01:26,988
just hold on there and

8
00:01:30,324 --> 00:01:31,926
you will be richer.

9
00:01:34,127 --> 00:01:35,495
You need that?

10
00:01:35,530 --> 00:01:36,831
You really don't need that.

11
00:01:40,068 --> 00:01:41,069
Bloody hell.

12
00:01:43,571 --> 00:01:44,438
Here we go.

13
00:01:54,247 --> 00:01:55,049
Francesca.

14
00:01:56,851 --> 00:01:58,686
- Chess please,

15
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:00,021
call me Chess.

16
00:02:00,054 --> 00:02:01,254
- Chess, hi.

17
00:02:01,288 --> 00:02:02,456
- You are?

18
00:02:02,489 --> 00:02:04,358
- My name is Kent Barber.

19
00:02:04,391 --> 00:02:05,960
And you must be Camilla?

20
00:02:05,994 --> 00:02:07,061
- I am.

21
00:02:07,095 --> 00:02:09,429
- Lovely to meet you.

22
00:02:09,463 --> 00:02:10,297
- Same.

23
00:02:11,264 --> 00:02:14,068
- How was your journey, good?

24
00:02:14,102 --> 00:02:15,235
- Yeah.
- Yeah,

25
00:02:15,268 --> 00:02:16,269
it was fine.

26
00:02:18,573 --> 00:02:20,675
- You look a bit dazed.

27
00:02:20,708 --> 00:02:21,509
- It was a long.

28
00:02:21,542 --> 00:02:22,677
- It is so nice in here.

29
00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:23,778
- I'm a little tired.

30
00:02:23,811 --> 00:02:24,612
- Good to be home?

31
00:02:24,646 --> 00:02:26,114
- Yeah.

32
00:02:26,146 --> 00:02:27,481
- Is there anyone else here?

33
00:02:27,515 --> 00:02:29,117
- No, it's just us,

34
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:32,386
and obviously, your father.

35
00:02:33,955 --> 00:02:35,288
- How is Hudson?

36
00:02:36,423 --> 00:02:37,257
- He's,

37
00:02:39,226 --> 00:02:41,228
moving on, shall we say,

38
00:02:42,530 --> 00:02:45,399
which is, I assume
why you're here.

39
00:02:45,432 --> 00:02:46,233
Let me introduce myself,

40
00:02:46,266 --> 00:02:47,902
my name is Kent Barber,

41
00:02:47,935 --> 00:02:51,706
I am your father's
palliative care assistant,

42
00:02:51,739 --> 00:02:53,941
I'm here to improve
his quality of life

43
00:02:53,975 --> 00:02:56,343
and execute his final wishes,

44
00:02:57,578 --> 00:03:00,347
which brings me on
to my next point.

45
00:03:02,617 --> 00:03:05,720
Could you please follow
me into the study

46
00:03:05,753 --> 00:03:07,822
as we need to take
care of some paperwork

47
00:03:07,855 --> 00:03:09,389
before anything else happens?

48
00:03:09,423 --> 00:03:11,291
- You know, Kent,

49
00:03:11,324 --> 00:03:13,360
we've had a long trip,

50
00:03:13,393 --> 00:03:15,228
I just would like to
get up to our room,

51
00:03:15,262 --> 00:03:17,297
get unpacked, rest a little
bit and then we'll talk about.

52
00:03:17,330 --> 00:03:18,398
- I understand,

53
00:03:18,432 --> 00:03:19,199
that's not possible.
- Whatever

54
00:03:19,232 --> 00:03:20,333
you need to talk about.

55
00:03:20,367 --> 00:03:21,669
- That's not possible
unfortunately,

56
00:03:21,703 --> 00:03:23,871
your father's
wishes are explicit,

57
00:03:23,905 --> 00:03:27,108
and I'm sure you're aware of
your father's temperament,

58
00:03:27,141 --> 00:03:28,142
so if we could just.

59
00:03:28,176 --> 00:03:29,342
- Trust me,

60
00:03:29,376 --> 00:03:30,845
I know my father's temperament,

61
00:03:30,878 --> 00:03:33,081
but my bedroom is
just up the stairs.

62
00:03:33,114 --> 00:03:35,016
- It'll take five minutes,

63
00:03:35,049 --> 00:03:36,316
into the study.

64
00:03:37,451 --> 00:03:39,921
Your father's wishes
are very clear.

65
00:03:39,954 --> 00:03:41,221
We don't want to
upset him, do we?

66
00:03:41,254 --> 00:03:43,390
Especially towards
the end of his life.

67
00:03:43,423 --> 00:03:46,259
- No, we don't wanna
upset Hudson, do we?

68
00:03:46,293 --> 00:03:47,494
- No.

69
00:03:47,528 --> 00:03:48,696
If you can follow me.

70
00:03:48,730 --> 00:03:50,765
I'm sure you know.
- I know the way, too.

71
00:03:50,798 --> 00:03:52,800
- Yes, of course, Chess.

72
00:03:57,404 --> 00:04:01,008
Oh, you can leave your
suitcases over there.

73
00:04:05,179 --> 00:04:07,782
Please take a seat on the sofa.

74
00:04:10,752 --> 00:04:12,220
You'll see in front
of you the letter

75
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:16,124
that your father asked me
to witness you signing.

76
00:04:28,136 --> 00:04:29,971
- It has both our names.

77
00:04:30,004 --> 00:04:31,005
- I'm sorry.

78
00:04:33,808 --> 00:04:35,576
I'll take care of it.

79
00:04:39,814 --> 00:04:41,414
- It's very simple.

80
00:04:55,196 --> 00:04:59,767
- Beneficiary affidavit
prepared by Todd Niece, Esquire,

81
00:04:59,801 --> 00:05:03,336
Niece, Bolton and
Linsky, Attorneys at Law.

82
00:05:06,841 --> 00:05:09,777
As heirs to the asset
of Hudson Mills Graham

83
00:05:09,811 --> 00:05:12,345
valued at $850 million,

84
00:05:12,379 --> 00:05:14,849
Mister Graham has
mandated the terms

85
00:05:14,882 --> 00:05:16,349
contained in this document

86
00:05:16,383 --> 00:05:19,687
for your inclusion in his
last will and testament.

87
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:22,723
Francesca Doris Graham Spencer
and Camilla Hudson Spencer

88
00:05:22,757 --> 00:05:25,092
must complete the following.

89
00:05:28,729 --> 00:05:31,632
Francesca and Camilla shall
remain in the residence

90
00:05:31,666 --> 00:05:33,034
upon signing this affidavit

91
00:05:33,067 --> 00:05:34,802
for a minimum of 48 hours

92
00:05:34,836 --> 00:05:36,938
prior to the death
of Mister Graham.

93
00:05:36,971 --> 00:05:40,975
they shall not leave the
grounds until dismissed

94
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:45,746
by Mister Graham's licensed
nurse practitioner.

95
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:46,714
- That's me.

96
00:05:46,747 --> 00:05:48,481
- Yeah, Kent.

97
00:05:48,516 --> 00:05:49,650
- Barber.

98
00:05:49,684 --> 00:05:51,052
- At the time of
Mister Graham's death,

99
00:05:51,085 --> 00:05:53,688
or with the written approval of

100
00:05:55,323 --> 00:05:56,691
Mister Barber.

101
00:05:56,724 --> 00:05:59,359
- Wait, wait.

102
00:05:59,392 --> 00:06:03,731
- Francesca shall sleep
in her childhood bedroom,

103
00:06:03,764 --> 00:06:07,668
and may not sleep in any
other room of the residence.

104
00:06:07,702 --> 00:06:09,971
Camilla may sleep in a
room of her choosing,

105
00:06:10,004 --> 00:06:14,441
either with Francesca or in
an unoccupied guest room.

106
00:06:15,610 --> 00:06:17,511
All guests invited
to the resident

107
00:06:17,545 --> 00:06:20,081
by Mister Graham dine
together in the same room

108
00:06:20,114 --> 00:06:22,550
a minimum of five times

109
00:06:22,583 --> 00:06:23,651
during their stay.
- Wait, wait, wait,

110
00:06:23,684 --> 00:06:25,953
wait, wait, wait, wait, Mom,

111
00:06:25,987 --> 00:06:30,224
why do you have to sleep
in your childhood bedroom?

112
00:06:32,059 --> 00:06:33,261
- I don't know,

113
00:06:33,294 --> 00:06:34,795
I don't know why I have
to sign this document

114
00:06:34,829 --> 00:06:37,064
to come into my
childhood home either.

115
00:06:37,098 --> 00:06:39,734
I don't understand any of this.

116
00:06:39,767 --> 00:06:43,170
- Okay, let's make it
all make sense, look.

117
00:06:43,204 --> 00:06:45,640
- Francesca shall work
with the other guests

118
00:06:45,673 --> 00:06:47,141
to divide the personal property

119
00:06:47,174 --> 00:06:49,677
contained within the resident,

120
00:06:50,578 --> 00:06:53,247
a fully executed affidavit

121
00:06:53,281 --> 00:06:55,616
must be delivered in
person to Mister Graham

122
00:06:55,650 --> 00:06:57,184
at his bedside immediately,

123
00:06:57,218 --> 00:06:59,419
in order to stay
and gain full access

124
00:06:59,452 --> 00:07:01,789
to the residence and grounds.

125
00:07:03,624 --> 00:07:04,825
The kitchen.
- The kitchen

126
00:07:04,859 --> 00:07:07,561
is stocked with
enough provisions

127
00:07:07,595 --> 00:07:11,299
to accommodate the invited
guests' stay on the premises.

128
00:07:11,332 --> 00:07:13,234
All arrangements
for final services

129
00:07:13,267 --> 00:07:15,970
and interment of Mister
Graham have been made

130
00:07:16,003 --> 00:07:17,972
and financially secured.

131
00:07:18,005 --> 00:07:20,942
Your attendance and
participation is requested,

132
00:07:20,975 --> 00:07:23,010
but not mandatory.

133
00:07:23,044 --> 00:07:24,979
- You're free to leave.

134
00:07:26,747 --> 00:07:28,683
- By signing this affidavit,

135
00:07:28,716 --> 00:07:31,152
you agree to the terms
herein and understand

136
00:07:31,185 --> 00:07:35,089
that failure to abide by all
conditions contained within

137
00:07:35,122 --> 00:07:39,093
shall result in forfeiture
to any and all claims

138
00:07:39,126 --> 00:07:42,863
as an heir to any and all
of Mister Graham's assets

139
00:07:42,897 --> 00:07:44,732
now and in the future.

140
00:07:47,134 --> 00:07:49,637
- So, it's your choice.

141
00:07:49,670 --> 00:07:50,604
- Is it?

142
00:07:50,638 --> 00:07:52,640
Well, you know what?

143
00:07:52,673 --> 00:07:55,910
I can stay at a
hotel up the street

144
00:07:55,943 --> 00:08:00,548
that doesn't require me to
sign any kind of paperwork,

145
00:08:00,581 --> 00:08:02,516
I mean, what.
- Francesca.

146
00:08:02,550 --> 00:08:03,918
You can do what you want.

147
00:08:03,951 --> 00:08:06,153
- You'll call me Chess.
- Hey.

148
00:08:06,187 --> 00:08:08,022
Just give us a moment.

149
00:08:09,223 --> 00:08:11,025
- Sweetie, we don't
have to do this,

150
00:08:11,058 --> 00:08:12,426
we don't need this.

151
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:15,129
- He will be gone in a few days,

152
00:08:16,063 --> 00:08:16,864
this is the last,

153
00:08:16,897 --> 00:08:18,766
this is the end.

154
00:08:18,799 --> 00:08:20,334
Why don't you want to stay?

155
00:08:20,368 --> 00:08:21,469
What's really?

156
00:08:21,502 --> 00:08:22,503
- Because I,

157
00:08:23,871 --> 00:08:26,307
don't like being manipulated.

158
00:08:28,009 --> 00:08:30,111
- Well, you came here so,

159
00:08:31,345 --> 00:08:32,880
why not play along?

160
00:08:32,913 --> 00:08:34,382
- Are we still the
only ones here?

161
00:08:34,415 --> 00:08:35,950
- So if I don't.

162
00:08:35,983 --> 00:08:37,685
- It's just us, right?

163
00:08:37,718 --> 00:08:39,253
Is it just us?

164
00:08:39,286 --> 00:08:41,589
- If I don't sign this,

165
00:08:41,622 --> 00:08:42,757
can I see him?

166
00:08:42,790 --> 00:08:44,291
- No, you may not.

167
00:08:45,826 --> 00:08:47,661
If you do not sign that paper,

168
00:08:47,695 --> 00:08:51,032
your next stop will
be out the front door.

169
00:08:51,065 --> 00:08:52,199
- Oh, you know what?

170
00:08:52,233 --> 00:08:55,369
Trust me, that's
something I'm used to.

171
00:08:56,237 --> 00:08:58,539
Camilla, what are you doing?

172
00:09:00,541 --> 00:09:01,642
- It's a really good,

173
00:09:01,675 --> 00:09:02,511
it's,

174
00:09:03,444 --> 00:09:05,312
he's gonna be gone.

175
00:09:05,346 --> 00:09:09,450
- I don't like hearing
that, it's so insensitive.

176
00:09:10,684 --> 00:09:14,855
- I mean it's my mom's
father, she's hurt.

177
00:09:14,889 --> 00:09:18,993
- Look, I would implore
you to sign that paper.

178
00:09:19,026 --> 00:09:21,530
There must be some
good memories here.

179
00:09:21,562 --> 00:09:23,864
- You don't know anything.

180
00:09:23,898 --> 00:09:28,169
I have a strong suspicion
you don't know anything.

181
00:09:28,202 --> 00:09:29,804
- Mom, you're not
giving me any reasons

182
00:09:29,837 --> 00:09:31,739
not to sign this paper.

183
00:09:36,777 --> 00:09:39,280
- Why don't you wanna sign it?

184
00:09:41,715 --> 00:09:43,050
- I mean,

185
00:09:43,084 --> 00:09:43,951
we're not gonna

186
00:09:43,984 --> 00:09:45,619
team up on her.
- Because.

187
00:09:45,653 --> 00:09:46,654
- That's what we're not.

188
00:09:46,687 --> 00:09:47,688
- I'm tired,

189
00:09:49,123 --> 00:09:51,292
of his manipulative games.

190
00:09:56,097 --> 00:09:56,997
- You're doing what's right.

191
00:09:57,031 --> 00:09:58,666
- Play along.

192
00:09:58,699 --> 00:10:01,802
- Just, you know, can
you stop saying that?

193
00:10:01,836 --> 00:10:04,038
Play along, this isn't a game,

194
00:10:04,071 --> 00:10:05,806
this isn't a legal transaction,

195
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:06,640
this isn't,

196
00:10:06,674 --> 00:10:07,475
this is,

197
00:10:07,509 --> 00:10:08,642
I'm his daughter.

198
00:10:08,676 --> 00:10:10,311
- This is real life.

199
00:10:10,344 --> 00:10:11,145
- This is real life.

200
00:10:11,178 --> 00:10:13,013
- Can you just

201
00:10:13,047 --> 00:10:13,881
shut up.

202
00:10:15,950 --> 00:10:17,451
Oh, my gosh.

203
00:10:17,485 --> 00:10:18,786
- Yes, Francesca.

204
00:10:18,819 --> 00:10:19,920
- Oh my gosh,

205
00:10:21,388 --> 00:10:22,223
just stop

206
00:10:23,424 --> 00:10:24,992
saying my name,

207
00:10:25,025 --> 00:10:26,794
could you stop saying

208
00:10:28,395 --> 00:10:30,364
just anything, just.

209
00:10:30,397 --> 00:10:31,465
- Absolutely.

210
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:34,603
I won't say another word.

211
00:10:35,769 --> 00:10:36,571
- Oh gosh.

212
00:10:39,907 --> 00:10:40,808
Sorry, mom.

213
00:10:43,711 --> 00:10:46,347
- Do you wanna stay here?

214
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:47,181
- I do.

215
00:10:49,551 --> 00:10:51,520
Honestly, I do.

216
00:10:51,553 --> 00:10:52,786
- Why?
- I just,

217
00:10:55,156 --> 00:10:56,824
I mean, I want,

218
00:10:56,857 --> 00:10:58,926
I care about family.

219
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:02,296
I don't understand why
you ever wanted to leave.

220
00:11:02,329 --> 00:11:05,933
Can you just tell
me what's going on?

221
00:11:05,966 --> 00:11:08,202
Why don't you want to sign?

222
00:11:12,373 --> 00:11:13,807
- Well done,

223
00:11:13,841 --> 00:11:16,177
you may now see your father.

224
00:11:22,517 --> 00:11:23,518
There he is.

225
00:11:28,289 --> 00:11:32,726
If you could place this on
the side table, thank you.

226
00:11:35,829 --> 00:11:37,331
- What happened to him?

227
00:11:37,364 --> 00:11:39,099
- He presented with late stage
dementia about two weeks ago,

228
00:11:39,133 --> 00:11:43,304
and, well, he's been
comatose for about two weeks.

229
00:11:52,213 --> 00:11:53,714
- What am I supposed
to do with this?

230
00:11:53,747 --> 00:11:57,117
- Present it to him and then
place it on the side table

231
00:11:57,151 --> 00:11:59,286
as I literally just
said when we came in.

232
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:02,389
- When was the last
time he was lucid?

233
00:12:03,791 --> 00:12:05,192
- Two months ago.

234
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:10,831
- And is that when he
planned all of this?

235
00:12:10,864 --> 00:12:13,500
- And why wouldn't
you reach out earlier?

236
00:12:13,535 --> 00:12:16,070
- I'm merely his caretaker.

237
00:12:16,103 --> 00:12:17,271
If you have any questions,

238
00:12:17,304 --> 00:12:19,240
you should contact
his attorneys.

239
00:12:19,273 --> 00:12:20,441
In the meantime,

240
00:12:20,474 --> 00:12:23,911
you are in the presence
of your grandfather,

241
00:12:24,778 --> 00:12:26,180
and your father.

242
00:12:26,213 --> 00:12:27,047
- I know.

243
00:12:28,550 --> 00:12:30,818
I don't need you
to tell me that.

244
00:12:30,851 --> 00:12:34,788
- Perhaps you should stop
directing your attention to me

245
00:12:34,822 --> 00:12:36,223
and focus on him.

246
00:12:37,791 --> 00:12:40,662
I would appreciate it if you
didn't scrunch up that letter.

247
00:12:40,695 --> 00:12:41,996
Thank you.

248
00:12:42,029 --> 00:12:43,430
- What's.

249
00:12:43,464 --> 00:12:44,633
- I think you are a
little smug, little prick.

250
00:12:44,666 --> 00:12:46,100
I have had it with
your attitude.

251
00:12:46,133 --> 00:12:48,335
How long have you known him?

252
00:12:48,369 --> 00:12:50,004
- I'm sorry.
- Shh, shh.

253
00:12:50,037 --> 00:12:52,439
- They don't mean to
upset you sir, it's fine.

254
00:12:52,473 --> 00:12:53,274
- Upset him?

255
00:12:53,307 --> 00:12:54,241
He's comatose.

256
00:12:54,275 --> 00:12:56,910
How long have you known him?

257
00:12:56,944 --> 00:12:57,878
- He can still hear.

258
00:12:57,911 --> 00:13:00,281
- How long have you known him?

259
00:13:02,016 --> 00:13:03,117
- Answer her.

260
00:13:04,118 --> 00:13:06,253
- For a good number of years.

261
00:13:06,287 --> 00:13:09,156
- Just stop acting
like you know me.

262
00:13:09,189 --> 00:13:10,824
I'm not entirely
convinced you know him,

263
00:13:10,858 --> 00:13:14,461
but I am pretty damn
certain you don't know me,

264
00:13:14,495 --> 00:13:16,864
so just knock it off.

265
00:13:16,897 --> 00:13:20,467
- You know, I don't
appreciate your attitude here.

266
00:13:20,502 --> 00:13:21,368
- Can't she have a moment?

267
00:13:21,402 --> 00:13:23,070
This is her father.

268
00:13:23,103 --> 00:13:25,272
- This is exactly what
I've been asking her to do,

269
00:13:25,306 --> 00:13:26,106
but she shouted.

270
00:13:26,140 --> 00:13:27,374
- Can you know,

271
00:13:27,408 --> 00:13:28,610
can you go away?

272
00:13:28,643 --> 00:13:31,812
- I also have a
note to give you.

273
00:13:31,845 --> 00:13:33,814
If you could take this
note I'd be very grateful,

274
00:13:33,847 --> 00:13:35,684
then I will leave you.

275
00:13:36,618 --> 00:13:37,451
Camilla?

276
00:13:39,654 --> 00:13:41,488
Could you give this to
your mother, please?

277
00:13:41,523 --> 00:13:45,426
I would be happy to remove
myself from this environment.

278
00:13:45,459 --> 00:13:46,293
Thank you.

279
00:13:52,299 --> 00:13:53,233
- You okay?

280
00:14:01,543 --> 00:14:02,376
- Dad?

281
00:14:10,719 --> 00:14:12,486
Dad, can you hear me?

282
00:14:14,955 --> 00:14:15,790
Dad?

283
00:14:18,827 --> 00:14:22,329
Do you remember the
time we went to Italy?

284
00:14:23,197 --> 00:14:24,532
Those blue caves

285
00:14:25,866 --> 00:14:26,867
in the boat,

286
00:14:28,369 --> 00:14:30,037
and you were rowing.

287
00:14:33,708 --> 00:14:34,542
Dad,

288
00:14:37,378 --> 00:14:41,549
I thought you were the
strongest man in the world,

289
00:14:43,150 --> 00:14:45,319
with the blue wall around.

290
00:14:50,424 --> 00:14:51,760
I miss that dad.

291
00:15:08,743 --> 00:15:10,110
I'm okay,

292
00:15:10,144 --> 00:15:11,546
it's okay, let's go,

293
00:15:11,579 --> 00:15:12,814
let's go upstairs.

294
00:15:12,847 --> 00:15:14,014
- You're sure?

295
00:15:14,047 --> 00:15:17,652
- Yeah, I'm okay,
it's okay, it's okay.

296
00:15:17,685 --> 00:15:18,520
I'm sorry,

297
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:22,222
I'm sorry, I'm sorry,

298
00:15:22,256 --> 00:15:23,090
I'm sorry.

299
00:15:24,391 --> 00:15:25,192
- I love you mom.

300
00:15:25,225 --> 00:15:26,493
- I know honey.

301
00:15:27,361 --> 00:15:28,195
I'm sorry.

302
00:15:30,532 --> 00:15:32,834
Sweetie, I'm sorry.

303
00:15:32,867 --> 00:15:34,067
- I love you.

304
00:15:34,101 --> 00:15:35,837
- It's gonna be okay.

305
00:15:50,484 --> 00:15:53,053
- I cannot not believe
we're in your room.

306
00:15:53,086 --> 00:15:55,289
- He hasn't changed a thing,

307
00:15:55,322 --> 00:15:57,291
it's exactly the same.

308
00:15:57,324 --> 00:15:58,292
Look,

309
00:15:58,325 --> 00:15:59,159
my doggie.

310
00:16:00,427 --> 00:16:01,228
Oh my God.

311
00:16:04,866 --> 00:16:05,700
Look,

312
00:16:06,701 --> 00:16:07,535
oh, toys.

313
00:16:08,503 --> 00:16:09,938
- Wait.

314
00:16:12,039 --> 00:16:13,875
- Oh, my gosh.

315
00:16:14,975 --> 00:16:16,611
- Did you ride horses?

316
00:16:16,644 --> 00:16:17,545
- Yeah,

317
00:16:17,579 --> 00:16:18,780
didn't I ever tell you that?

318
00:16:18,813 --> 00:16:21,516
- No, I would love
to ride horses.

319
00:16:21,549 --> 00:16:23,350
- Oh yeah, it was,

320
00:16:23,383 --> 00:16:24,586
it was a lot of fun,

321
00:16:24,619 --> 00:16:25,520
I loved it.

322
00:16:26,554 --> 00:16:28,055
- Look at all of these awards.

323
00:16:28,088 --> 00:16:30,390
How could you
forget that detail?

324
00:16:30,424 --> 00:16:32,927
- Sorry, I don't know, I just,

325
00:16:33,962 --> 00:16:36,096
I had to stop and,

326
00:16:36,129 --> 00:16:37,331
I don't know,

327
00:16:37,364 --> 00:16:38,298
it just seemed easier
to put it behind me.

328
00:16:38,332 --> 00:16:40,568
- What made you stop?

329
00:16:40,602 --> 00:16:42,670
- Your grandfather.

330
00:16:42,704 --> 00:16:44,973
- Why would he make you stop?

331
00:16:45,005 --> 00:16:46,508
- I busted my arm,

332
00:16:47,374 --> 00:16:48,910
and I wanted get right back on,

333
00:16:48,943 --> 00:16:50,812
you know, whenever
you fall off a horse,

334
00:16:50,845 --> 00:16:52,246
you get right back on, right?

335
00:16:52,279 --> 00:16:54,816
And I was ready to
get back on but,

336
00:16:54,849 --> 00:16:57,084
it really bothered
him, and he said,

337
00:16:57,117 --> 00:17:00,522
either I quit or else
he'd sell everything,

338
00:17:00,555 --> 00:17:01,523
sell them all.

339
00:17:01,556 --> 00:17:02,991
- Sell what, your horses?

340
00:17:03,023 --> 00:17:04,157
- Yeah, my babies.

341
00:17:04,191 --> 00:17:05,158
- Are there horses back there.

342
00:17:05,192 --> 00:17:06,360
- No, but look,

343
00:17:06,393 --> 00:17:08,495
there, do you see that
house right there?

344
00:17:08,530 --> 00:17:10,765
That's Alice's house,

345
00:17:10,798 --> 00:17:12,901
and at night we
would send each other

346
00:17:12,934 --> 00:17:14,167
some flashlight signals.

347
00:17:14,201 --> 00:17:15,537
- Wait, Aunt Ally lived there?

348
00:17:15,570 --> 00:17:18,338
- Yeah, yeah, see that
house right there?

349
00:17:18,372 --> 00:17:22,544
And we'd signal each
other with the thing.

350
00:17:22,577 --> 00:17:23,645
- Wow.

351
00:17:23,678 --> 00:17:24,846
- It was so fun.

352
00:17:24,879 --> 00:17:26,213
Yeah, I mean, we could
have just called,

353
00:17:26,246 --> 00:17:27,749
but where's the fun of that?

354
00:17:27,782 --> 00:17:28,616
- Wow.

355
00:17:30,852 --> 00:17:31,819
- Oh, look at this.

356
00:17:31,853 --> 00:17:33,021
- Oh, my gosh.

357
00:17:34,421 --> 00:17:38,793
- The same, it's all the same,
like nothing ever changed.

358
00:17:41,563 --> 00:17:44,264
My mom helped me pick out this.

359
00:17:44,298 --> 00:17:47,467
We were gonna paint the
room this color right here.

360
00:17:47,502 --> 00:17:48,836
- Was this your favorite color?

361
00:17:48,870 --> 00:17:52,040
- Mm-hm, but we never
got around to it.

362
00:17:52,072 --> 00:17:53,340
- Gosh.

363
00:17:53,373 --> 00:17:56,410
Williams School Honor Society.

364
00:17:56,443 --> 00:17:57,612
- From high school.
- Mom.

365
00:17:57,645 --> 00:17:59,514
So you always went by Spencer,

366
00:17:59,547 --> 00:18:01,816
even back in high school?

367
00:18:01,849 --> 00:18:02,684
- Well,

368
00:18:03,851 --> 00:18:06,253
yeah, I started
going by Spencer,

369
00:18:06,286 --> 00:18:11,091
then when I was in college I
legally changed it to Spencer.

370
00:18:11,124 --> 00:18:13,695
I was done with being a Graham.

371
00:18:19,834 --> 00:18:21,836
- That's not Ken, is it?

372
00:18:21,869 --> 00:18:22,704
- No.

373
00:18:25,073 --> 00:18:25,907
HMG.

374
00:18:26,774 --> 00:18:28,676
- Hudson.
- It's Hudson.

375
00:18:32,479 --> 00:18:35,750
Perception is strong
and sight is weak,

376
00:18:35,783 --> 00:18:39,319
in strategy it is important
to see distant things

377
00:18:39,353 --> 00:18:41,188
as if they were close,

378
00:18:42,322 --> 00:18:46,326
and take a distant
view of close things.

379
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:48,529
Life is for the living.

380
00:18:48,563 --> 00:18:51,099
I don't know what
that's supposed to mean.

381
00:18:51,131 --> 00:18:51,966
- Wait.

382
00:18:53,701 --> 00:18:56,871
- He called me Chess
when I was little,

383
00:18:56,904 --> 00:18:58,673
because he said I
could always see

384
00:18:58,706 --> 00:19:03,578
you're working on some kind
of strategy in your eyes.

385
00:19:03,611 --> 00:19:04,444
Strategy,

386
00:19:06,047 --> 00:19:08,348
I know what the strategy is now.

387
00:19:08,382 --> 00:19:10,484
- But it's important
to see distant things

388
00:19:10,518 --> 00:19:12,053
as if they were close,

389
00:19:12,086 --> 00:19:15,690
and to take a distant
view of close things.

390
00:19:17,992 --> 00:19:19,994
You don't have any idea?

391
00:19:26,834 --> 00:19:28,435
- Oh God, now what?

392
00:19:38,713 --> 00:19:39,547
- Daggett,

393
00:19:41,516 --> 00:19:42,583
welcome back.

394
00:19:43,518 --> 00:19:44,652
You must be Bronson.

395
00:19:44,686 --> 00:19:45,520
- I am.

396
00:19:48,723 --> 00:19:50,758
- Did you have a good journey?

397
00:19:50,792 --> 00:19:51,693
- I think so.

398
00:19:51,726 --> 00:19:52,492
- Yeah, it was a long one,

399
00:19:52,527 --> 00:19:54,162
just I need one second.

400
00:19:54,194 --> 00:19:55,429
- You think so?

401
00:19:55,462 --> 00:19:57,031
- So this is.

402
00:19:57,065 --> 00:19:57,965
Yeah.

403
00:19:57,999 --> 00:20:00,434
- This is the place, son.

404
00:20:00,467 --> 00:20:01,903
- Indeed it is.

405
00:20:01,936 --> 00:20:03,437
- It's been a long journey,
we're gonna freshen up,

406
00:20:03,470 --> 00:20:04,404
I wanna show you around.

407
00:20:04,438 --> 00:20:06,674
- Unfortunately Daggett,

408
00:20:06,708 --> 00:20:08,710
I have something to,

409
00:20:08,743 --> 00:20:09,544
I have something to tell you.

410
00:20:09,577 --> 00:20:10,778
- I'm sorry,

411
00:20:10,812 --> 00:20:12,013
can you tell me
who you are again?

412
00:20:12,046 --> 00:20:13,181
- Absolutely,

413
00:20:13,213 --> 00:20:14,582
my name is Kent Barber,

414
00:20:14,615 --> 00:20:17,018
I am your father's
palliative care assistant,

415
00:20:17,051 --> 00:20:18,920
I'm here to improve
his quality of life.

416
00:20:18,953 --> 00:20:20,420
- I will definitely have
questions about that,

417
00:20:20,454 --> 00:20:21,889
we're just gonna
freshen up first.

418
00:20:21,923 --> 00:20:24,324
- Before you go, I do
have something to tell you

419
00:20:24,357 --> 00:20:27,260
that your father
has explicit wishes

420
00:20:27,294 --> 00:20:30,631
for you to follow
me into the study

421
00:20:30,665 --> 00:20:33,366
and sign some paperwork
before you see any.

422
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:34,535
- I'm sorry,

423
00:20:34,569 --> 00:20:36,204
sign paperwork?

424
00:20:36,236 --> 00:20:37,538
This is my house,

425
00:20:37,572 --> 00:20:38,639
I grew up in this house.

426
00:20:38,673 --> 00:20:40,240
- It's not your house, is it?

427
00:20:40,273 --> 00:20:43,310
- It certainly is, it's my
childhood home, I grew up here.

428
00:20:43,343 --> 00:20:45,179
- You don't live
here now, do you?

429
00:20:45,213 --> 00:20:47,148
- I don't understand what
that has to do with anything.

430
00:20:47,181 --> 00:20:49,083
What kind of papers,
why would I sign papers?

431
00:20:49,117 --> 00:20:51,318
- When you're in
your father's house,

432
00:20:51,351 --> 00:20:55,523
you follow his rules
and these are his rules,

433
00:20:55,556 --> 00:20:57,525
or you're free to leave.

434
00:20:59,861 --> 00:21:01,062
- I'm sorry.

435
00:21:01,095 --> 00:21:02,663
- Please follow me.

436
00:21:05,032 --> 00:21:06,601
- Let's follow him.

437
00:21:13,340 --> 00:21:17,011
- You can leave your
bags on the side there.

438
00:21:19,747 --> 00:21:22,349
Please take a seat on the sofa.

439
00:21:23,584 --> 00:21:24,417
Thank you.

440
00:21:25,853 --> 00:21:28,523
Now you'll see before
you the letter,

441
00:21:28,556 --> 00:21:31,826
that your father
Daggett, had drawn up.

442
00:21:33,194 --> 00:21:35,328
You cannot gain access
to the rest of the house

443
00:21:35,362 --> 00:21:38,199
until I see that
letter has signed

444
00:21:39,634 --> 00:21:42,369
and we deliver it
to your father.

445
00:21:45,072 --> 00:21:46,439
It's your choice.

446
00:21:48,475 --> 00:21:51,444
- First of all,
people call me Clay.

447
00:21:52,580 --> 00:21:53,380
Secondly,

448
00:21:55,149 --> 00:21:57,718
I'm not happy with any of this.

449
00:22:00,288 --> 00:22:02,223
- Well, your happiness.
- I know that.

450
00:22:02,256 --> 00:22:04,424
- Really Isn't my concern.

451
00:22:10,131 --> 00:22:12,867
- As heirs to the assets
of Hudson Mills Graham

452
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:14,802

- Do you understand?

504
00:24:34,308 --> 00:24:37,378
- Failure to abide
by all conditions.

505
00:24:38,312 --> 00:24:40,480
- Do you understand, Clay?

506
00:24:44,118 --> 00:24:45,686
- This is madness.

507
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:48,122
- It's simple, is what it is.

508
00:24:48,990 --> 00:24:50,658
- Just sign it, dad.

509
00:24:52,526 --> 00:24:55,730
- I'd listen to your
son if were you.

510
00:24:55,763 --> 00:24:57,631
- I've heard enough
out of you, thank you.

511
00:24:57,665 --> 00:24:58,599
- Have you?

512
00:25:00,601 --> 00:25:04,205
You'll be hearing a
little bit more from me.

513
00:25:06,674 --> 00:25:07,508
Quite a bit.

514
00:25:07,541 --> 00:25:09,043
- This is for you.

515
00:25:10,044 --> 00:25:11,612
- I'm here for you.

516
00:25:28,129 --> 00:25:29,563
- Well done.

517
00:25:29,597 --> 00:25:32,266
- I used to play in this office,

518
00:25:33,434 --> 00:25:36,570
when my father worked
before he was born.

519
00:25:40,509 --> 00:25:42,009
- Well done.

520
00:25:42,043 --> 00:25:42,877
Next stop,

521
00:25:43,944 --> 00:25:45,780
your father's bedroom.

522
00:25:47,014 --> 00:25:47,915
- Fine.

523
00:25:47,948 --> 00:25:48,949
- Follow me.

524
00:25:54,688 --> 00:25:55,524
So Clay,

525
00:25:58,759 --> 00:26:01,128
there is your father,

526
00:26:01,162 --> 00:26:04,231
could you please take this
and present it to him?

527
00:26:04,265 --> 00:26:05,766
Thank you Bronson,

528
00:26:07,034 --> 00:26:07,868
and then.

529
00:26:12,273 --> 00:26:13,441
- How do I present it to him,

530
00:26:13,474 --> 00:26:14,642
he's not even,

531
00:26:17,745 --> 00:26:19,413
he's not even awake.

532
00:26:20,981 --> 00:26:22,950
Is he responsive?

533
00:26:22,983 --> 00:26:25,653
- He's aware of you, definitely.

534
00:26:26,921 --> 00:26:29,123
He's on 120 milligrams
of haloperidol

535
00:26:29,156 --> 00:26:31,659
which is an antipsychotic, and

536
00:26:33,727 --> 00:26:35,229
10 milligrams of dilaudid a day.

537
00:26:35,262 --> 00:26:36,897
- Why would you do that?

538
00:26:36,931 --> 00:26:40,034
- He's in a deep
amount of pain, sir.

539
00:26:46,107 --> 00:26:46,941
- Hudson?

540
00:26:50,512 --> 00:26:51,345
Dad?

541
00:26:56,917 --> 00:26:58,919
This is your grandchild,

542
00:26:59,954 --> 00:27:00,754
Bronson.

543
00:27:02,857 --> 00:27:04,692
- How's it going, Pop?

544
00:27:07,027 --> 00:27:09,029
- He wanted to meet you.

545
00:27:13,934 --> 00:27:14,935
- Sorry dad.

546
00:27:24,178 --> 00:27:27,081
- I know it's been
a long time but,

547
00:27:29,650 --> 00:27:31,385
I couldn't come home.

548
00:27:33,954 --> 00:27:36,690
I don't know if
you wanted me to,

549
00:27:38,527 --> 00:27:40,194
but I have a family.

550
00:27:44,865 --> 00:27:46,700
Things are going well.

551
00:27:54,576 --> 00:27:57,411
- I really don't
know what to say,

552
00:27:58,979 --> 00:28:00,080
never really,

553
00:28:01,182 --> 00:28:03,384
never really knew you, but,

554
00:28:04,785 --> 00:28:06,787
you know I'm a musician.

555
00:28:07,988 --> 00:28:09,857
- He's really good,

556
00:28:09,890 --> 00:28:11,458
he's really good,

557
00:28:11,492 --> 00:28:12,826
so proud of him.

558
00:28:14,495 --> 00:28:17,198
- Yeah, we just got
back from a tour,

559
00:28:17,231 --> 00:28:18,832
that's pretty cool,

560
00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:23,037
and got to see a lot of Europe,

561
00:28:23,070 --> 00:28:24,305
which was really beautiful,

562
00:28:24,338 --> 00:28:27,441
I didn't ever think
I'd be over there.

563
00:28:27,474 --> 00:28:30,711
- Maybe we'll play some of
his music for you later.

564
00:28:30,744 --> 00:28:33,247
- I'm sure he would love that.

565
00:28:34,114 --> 00:28:35,382
Clay,

566
00:28:35,416 --> 00:28:38,419
your father wanted you
to have this as well,

567
00:28:38,452 --> 00:28:41,222
it's a personal
handwritten note.

568
00:28:44,693 --> 00:28:47,228
- I must open it now?

569
00:28:47,261 --> 00:28:49,263
- It's up to you.

570
00:28:49,296 --> 00:28:51,465
I can leave you two to be.

571
00:28:54,969 --> 00:28:56,437
- Yes, please.

572
00:28:56,470 --> 00:28:57,304
- Yes.

573
00:29:22,396 --> 00:29:25,466
- Why didn't you
tell me this before?

574
00:29:26,467 --> 00:29:29,036
I never knew you felt this way.

575
00:29:36,645 --> 00:29:39,146
He always wanted me to fit in.

576
00:29:40,649 --> 00:29:44,218
Well, I didn't fit in,
but I did just fine.

577
00:29:50,190 --> 00:29:51,660
Let's go.

578
00:29:51,693 --> 00:29:53,294
I have seen enough.

579
00:30:01,835 --> 00:30:03,837
- I'll take care of him.

580
00:30:14,448 --> 00:30:15,249
Wow.

581
00:30:15,282 --> 00:30:16,483
- Yeah,

582
00:30:16,518 --> 00:30:20,321
it's seems a lot smaller
than when I was a kid.

583
00:30:21,523 --> 00:30:24,191
- It's not what I was expecting.

584
00:30:25,359 --> 00:30:27,796
- You thought it
might be brighter.

585
00:30:27,828 --> 00:30:30,164
- Yeah, it's a little bland.

586
00:30:30,197 --> 00:30:34,368
- Yeah, well, that was
probably my mood back then.

587
00:30:35,869 --> 00:30:37,104
I also tried to

588
00:30:38,238 --> 00:30:41,676
put the color into
photographs that I took.

589
00:30:43,712 --> 00:30:46,080
I used to play around
with that thing a lot,

590
00:30:46,113 --> 00:30:47,816
tried to learn how to edit.

591
00:30:47,848 --> 00:30:49,350
That was my dark room,

592
00:30:49,383 --> 00:30:51,285
that closet over there.

593
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:55,724
Did some good stuff
here, look at this.

594
00:30:59,393 --> 00:31:01,596
Aunt Lola used to buy
those all the time.

595
00:31:01,629 --> 00:31:02,797
- And you took these?

596
00:31:02,831 --> 00:31:04,632
- Put a bunch of
them together, yeah.

597
00:31:04,666 --> 00:31:05,700
- Wow.

598
00:31:05,734 --> 00:31:07,501
A Little artist, huh?

599
00:31:08,936 --> 00:31:13,040
- Yeah, I don't know if
it was a gift or a refuge.

600
00:31:15,810 --> 00:31:17,077
- You know dad,

601
00:31:19,179 --> 00:31:21,248
was I kind of weird downstairs?

602
00:31:21,281 --> 00:31:25,486
'Cause I really don't
know grandpa that well,

603
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:27,020
so I kind of felt,

604
00:31:29,056 --> 00:31:31,793
felt kind of weird, you know.

605
00:31:31,826 --> 00:31:35,262
- Yeah, says a little
something about me,

606
00:31:36,664 --> 00:31:39,099
or what he thought was me.

607
00:31:39,133 --> 00:31:39,967
- Clay,

608
00:31:41,402 --> 00:31:43,971
the person who follows the
crowd will usually get,

609
00:31:44,004 --> 00:31:46,708
usually go no further
than the crowd.

610
00:31:46,741 --> 00:31:48,008
The person who walks alone

611
00:31:48,041 --> 00:31:49,711
is likely to find
himself in places,

612
00:31:49,744 --> 00:31:51,211
no one has ever seen before.

613
00:31:51,245 --> 00:31:54,816
- He always wanted me
to be part of the crowd.

614
00:31:54,849 --> 00:31:58,252
He always wanted everyone
to be part of the crowd,

615
00:31:58,285 --> 00:32:00,120
that's how he thought
I would fit in.

616
00:32:00,154 --> 00:32:01,221
- What do you mean?

617
00:32:01,255 --> 00:32:02,055
- But,

618
00:32:03,725 --> 00:32:05,560
he walked alone a lot.

619
00:32:06,628 --> 00:32:09,831
He left us for long stretches.

620
00:32:09,864 --> 00:32:14,101
He was always away on
business doing his own thing.

621
00:32:14,968 --> 00:32:16,970
I don't know, it's like,

622
00:32:17,004 --> 00:32:19,973
what I had to
discover on my own,

623
00:32:20,007 --> 00:32:22,342
he discovered it on his own.

624
00:32:23,711 --> 00:32:27,181
I just wish we could
have done it together.

625
00:32:27,214 --> 00:32:29,116
- So like what,

626
00:32:29,149 --> 00:32:30,317
what happened?

627
00:32:31,452 --> 00:32:33,721
You guys seemed to like kinda

628
00:32:33,755 --> 00:32:35,956
lost connection after a while.

629
00:32:35,989 --> 00:32:40,227
- I wasn't the son he
thought I was supposed to be,

630
00:32:42,062 --> 00:32:45,365
and I think he saw mom in Chess.

631
00:32:45,399 --> 00:32:48,903
Mom was gone and he
couldn't stand it.

632
00:32:48,937 --> 00:32:51,539
It was like it was hard
for him to look at her,

633
00:32:51,573 --> 00:32:54,509
because she represented
everything that he had lost,

634
00:32:54,542 --> 00:32:56,443
his fault in many ways,

635
00:32:57,645 --> 00:32:58,746
and he couldn't look at me

636
00:32:58,780 --> 00:33:01,381
because I represented everything

637
00:33:02,550 --> 00:33:03,551
he abhorred.

638
00:33:08,222 --> 00:33:12,125
Funny thing is maybe
if he could see me now,

639
00:33:12,159 --> 00:33:15,362
maybe he would be proud of me.

640
00:33:15,395 --> 00:33:16,997
I don't know.

641
00:33:19,901 --> 00:33:22,837
Oh, I wonder if
that's Chess or JR?

642
00:33:25,172 --> 00:33:26,340
- JR.

643
00:33:26,373 --> 00:33:27,976
- How are you today?

644
00:33:28,008 --> 00:33:31,478
- I'm better now
that I've seen you.

645
00:33:31,513 --> 00:33:34,114
- How's the old man holding up?

646
00:33:37,484 --> 00:33:39,152
- It's coming close.

647
00:33:42,590 --> 00:33:43,791
Would you like me
to take your bag?

648
00:33:43,825 --> 00:33:46,293
- Well, who else is here?

649
00:33:46,326 --> 00:33:49,162
- Well, we've got a full house.

650
00:33:49,196 --> 00:33:50,030
- I see.

651
00:33:51,799 --> 00:33:53,735
Sure, you can take my bag.

652
00:33:53,768 --> 00:33:55,269
- Absolutely sir.

653
00:33:55,302 --> 00:33:58,506
Now, your father has
some specific requests

654
00:33:58,540 --> 00:34:00,073
before we continue.

655
00:34:01,709 --> 00:34:02,877
If you could follow
me into the study

656
00:34:02,911 --> 00:34:05,013
he'd like you to
sign some paperwork.

657
00:34:05,045 --> 00:34:05,914
- No problem.

658
00:34:05,947 --> 00:34:07,281
- Thank you, JR.

659
00:34:11,451 --> 00:34:12,687
Right this way, JR.

660
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:14,421
I'll put your bag down here.

661
00:34:14,454 --> 00:34:17,057
Please take a seat on the sofa.

662
00:34:18,526 --> 00:34:22,931
So, this is the letter that
your father had me draw up.

663
00:34:25,432 --> 00:34:27,334
If you care to read it,

664
00:34:28,870 --> 00:34:32,006
and if you decide to sign it,

665
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:33,508
fine, if you don't,

666
00:34:33,541 --> 00:34:34,976
that's also fine.

667
00:34:36,176 --> 00:34:39,013
Then we'll go into
your father's room

668
00:34:39,047 --> 00:34:41,281
and deliver the letter.

669
00:34:41,315 --> 00:34:42,584
Take your time.

670
00:35:02,537 --> 00:35:05,006
It's straight to the point,

671
00:35:05,039 --> 00:35:06,874
just like your father.

672
00:35:14,849 --> 00:35:15,950
Good man, JR.

673
00:35:19,554 --> 00:35:20,387
Good man.

674
00:35:22,356 --> 00:35:23,758
- There you are.
- Right, yeah.

675
00:35:23,791 --> 00:35:26,928
Excellent, let's get
this underway then.

676
00:35:26,961 --> 00:35:30,632
- Yeah, I guess it's time
to go face the music.

677
00:35:30,665 --> 00:35:32,499
- Very good, this way.

678
00:35:35,970 --> 00:35:37,572
Right this way, JR.

679
00:35:41,743 --> 00:35:42,577
- Hey dad.

680
00:35:47,115 --> 00:35:48,281
- Here you go.

681
00:35:51,019 --> 00:35:54,789
- Here's the letter
you wanted us to sign.

682
00:35:54,822 --> 00:35:56,156
Everyone's here.

683
00:35:58,425 --> 00:36:00,293
I had a little something
I wanted to give you,

684
00:36:00,327 --> 00:36:02,096
it kind of represents,

685
00:36:03,998 --> 00:36:07,167
the journey I've had
in life in a way,

686
00:36:08,503 --> 00:36:11,839
and I know I was a
terrible son at times and,

687
00:36:13,541 --> 00:36:17,444
anyway, there was a ministry
that started in prison

688
00:36:17,477 --> 00:36:20,882
and these bracelets
are actually made

689
00:36:20,915 --> 00:36:23,718
out of torn pages of magazines,

690
00:36:23,751 --> 00:36:27,655
to kind of represent how
some of us tear our lives up,

691
00:36:27,689 --> 00:36:29,624
and we're ripped apart.

692
00:36:30,792 --> 00:36:33,961
And the guy who
started this ministry,

693
00:36:35,663 --> 00:36:39,499
he has a very similar
story to mine and yours,

694
00:36:40,568 --> 00:36:43,071
and it's called, "Torn Pages."

695
00:36:44,605 --> 00:36:47,742
And I just wanted
to give you this,

696
00:36:47,775 --> 00:36:51,045
kind of as a symbol
of my love for you.

697
00:36:51,879 --> 00:36:53,313
I've got one too.

698
00:37:01,055 --> 00:37:02,857
I knew you liked brown better,

699
00:37:02,890 --> 00:37:05,660
and I like my
colors as you know.

700
00:37:11,833 --> 00:37:13,101
I love you dad.

701
00:37:14,367 --> 00:37:17,038
I hope you rest easy and,

702
00:37:17,071 --> 00:37:20,708
maybe one day I'll see
you on the other side.

703
00:37:20,742 --> 00:37:21,576
- JR,

704
00:37:22,877 --> 00:37:23,711
that

705
00:37:24,912 --> 00:37:26,080
was beautiful.

706
00:37:27,849 --> 00:37:31,485
He wanted you also to
have another special note,

707
00:37:31,519 --> 00:37:33,386
especially for you sir.

708
00:37:33,420 --> 00:37:34,989
I'll let you open that alone,

709
00:37:35,022 --> 00:37:36,591
and my condolences.

710
00:37:37,825 --> 00:37:39,894
- All right, thanks Kent.

711
00:37:44,532 --> 00:37:48,870
I have to get my eyes dad,
I can't see worth a damn.

712
00:37:55,408 --> 00:38:00,413
JR, it is not the strongest
of the species that survive,

713
00:38:01,281 --> 00:38:03,383
nor the most intelligent,

714
00:38:03,416 --> 00:38:06,821
but the one most
responsive to change,

715
00:38:06,854 --> 00:38:08,122
Charles Darwin.

716
00:38:11,491 --> 00:38:13,426
Life is for the living.

717
00:38:18,232 --> 00:38:20,101
Thank you dad.

718
00:38:20,134 --> 00:38:21,135
Means a lot.

719
00:38:40,154 --> 00:38:41,354
- This is the kitchen,

720
00:38:41,388 --> 00:38:44,926
only it didn't look like
this when I was here.

721
00:38:44,959 --> 00:38:47,228
- Good, 'cause I am hungry.

722
00:38:50,031 --> 00:38:50,932
- Anything,

723
00:38:51,866 --> 00:38:53,701
bigly healthy in here?

724
00:38:56,537 --> 00:38:57,337
- Oh, whoa.

725
00:38:57,370 --> 00:38:58,573
I'll take chips,

726
00:38:58,606 --> 00:39:01,876
I don't kinda want a
healthy option today.

727
00:39:01,909 --> 00:39:03,110
It's been a long day.

728
00:39:03,144 --> 00:39:04,377
- Well, this is where
the kitchen always was,

729
00:39:04,411 --> 00:39:06,247
but this isn't how it looked.

730
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:07,114
Hey you.

731
00:39:10,818 --> 00:39:13,054
- Did he tell you about
the European trip?

732
00:39:13,087 --> 00:39:18,092
- Oh, you know, I'm
married to the.

733
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:22,330
- Did you all meet Kent?

734
00:39:22,362 --> 00:39:23,396
- Yes.

735
00:39:23,430 --> 00:39:24,298
Yes.

736
00:39:24,332 --> 00:39:26,167
Well, he's not really,

737
00:39:27,635 --> 00:39:30,004
you know, getting
along with him, but.

738
00:39:30,037 --> 00:39:30,838
- Look at that.

739
00:39:30,872 --> 00:39:32,306
- She's not either.

740
00:39:32,340 --> 00:39:34,075
- How's it going?

741
00:39:34,108 --> 00:39:35,810
- What, they don't
sell razors in Oregon?

742
00:39:35,843 --> 00:39:36,677
- I know.

743
00:39:39,247 --> 00:39:40,548
- Good to see you.
- Me too.

744
00:39:40,581 --> 00:39:42,750
- Goodness you've grown,
you are more handsome.

745
00:39:42,783 --> 00:39:44,218
Look at that face.

746
00:39:44,252 --> 00:39:45,720
- I just a little hair in
here would be nice, you know.

747
00:39:45,753 --> 00:39:47,889
- JR.

748
00:39:47,922 --> 00:39:50,758
- Hey, how's it going Chess?

749
00:39:50,791 --> 00:39:52,627
You look wonderful.

750
00:39:52,660 --> 00:39:53,694
- Look at you.

751
00:39:53,728 --> 00:39:55,663
- Beats prison stripes, huh?

752
00:39:55,696 --> 00:39:57,832
- Well, you kind of stuck
with the stripe theme,

753
00:39:57,865 --> 00:39:59,967
you are so dapper looking.

754
00:40:00,001 --> 00:40:01,936
- Wait, who is this?

755
00:40:01,969 --> 00:40:04,171
- This is your Uncle JR.

756
00:40:04,205 --> 00:40:06,641
This is my daughter, Camilla.

757
00:40:06,674 --> 00:40:08,910
- So this is the
fuckin' homophobe.

758
00:40:08,943 --> 00:40:09,777
- Camilla.

759
00:40:10,678 --> 00:40:11,879
- No.

760
00:40:11,913 --> 00:40:14,015
- JR, she's just upset
because you didn't come

761
00:40:14,048 --> 00:40:16,384
to her Uncle Clay's wedding.

762
00:40:19,387 --> 00:40:21,656
- People can change.

763
00:40:21,689 --> 00:40:22,523
- He's.

764
00:40:23,958 --> 00:40:24,792
- Hey.

765
00:40:27,494 --> 00:40:28,329
What's you been up to?
- Good to see you,

766
00:40:28,362 --> 00:40:29,797
you look good.

767
00:40:29,830 --> 00:40:31,699
- Thanks, you too.

768
00:40:31,732 --> 00:40:33,034
- You look good, Bronson.

769
00:40:33,067 --> 00:40:35,736
Good to see you buddy.
- Good to see you.

770
00:40:35,770 --> 00:40:37,872
- Cookies and milk, anybody?

771
00:40:37,905 --> 00:40:39,907
- I could go for some water.

772
00:40:39,941 --> 00:40:40,975
- Some water.

773
00:40:42,176 --> 00:40:44,645
- So how long have
you been here?

774
00:40:44,679 --> 00:40:48,382
- We just got here
a little while ago.

775
00:40:48,416 --> 00:40:49,717
It's been a busy

776
00:40:50,952 --> 00:40:51,852
hour or so.

777
00:40:52,820 --> 00:40:53,621
- Okay.

778
00:40:53,654 --> 00:40:55,488
- Lot of surprises.

779
00:40:55,523 --> 00:40:57,658
- What is with this house?

780
00:40:59,593 --> 00:41:02,730
- What is with the gatekeeper?

781
00:41:02,763 --> 00:41:04,298
- Kent?

782
00:41:04,332 --> 00:41:06,000
I hate that guy.

783
00:41:06,033 --> 00:41:09,036
- Well, I guess dad thought
he needed to hire a caregiver.

784
00:41:09,070 --> 00:41:10,738
- I assume you all
got the contract.

785
00:41:10,771 --> 00:41:12,006
- He's not just a care-

786
00:41:12,039 --> 00:41:13,240
What is with the contract?

787
00:41:13,274 --> 00:41:14,275
Did you sign it?

788
00:41:14,308 --> 00:41:15,142
Yeah, we were asked to sign.

789
00:41:15,176 --> 00:41:16,410
- Yeah, I signed one,

790
00:41:16,444 --> 00:41:19,146
couldn't get in
without signing it.

791
00:41:19,180 --> 00:41:22,984
- I told you this family is
always based on transactions.

792
00:41:23,017 --> 00:41:24,185
- First of all, he
pays me to leave,

793
00:41:24,218 --> 00:41:27,054
and now he's paying me to stay.

794
00:41:27,088 --> 00:41:29,557
- At least he paid you.

795
00:41:29,590 --> 00:41:33,227
- Yeah, I guess I can't
complain, I have my school.

796
00:41:33,260 --> 00:41:36,230
- I didn't ask, it was kinda.

797
00:41:36,263 --> 00:41:37,732
- My mom.

798
00:41:37,765 --> 00:41:41,635
- So I assume everybody
signed it without question?

799
00:41:41,669 --> 00:41:44,138
- Brother, look at you,
you're getting gray.

800
00:41:44,171 --> 00:41:46,007
Yeah, we're both
getting gray, huh?

801
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:49,677
- That happened
a long time ago.

802
00:41:49,710 --> 00:41:51,078
- Giorgio didn't wanna come

803
00:41:51,112 --> 00:41:53,914
and join the fun
family time here?

804
00:41:55,549 --> 00:41:59,487
- He rarely leaves the
kitchen right now, we are-

805
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:02,289
- Yeah, how's
the restaurant going?

806
00:42:02,323 --> 00:42:06,460
- You know the restaurant
businesses, it's always hard.

807
00:42:06,494 --> 00:42:07,995
- That is a rough.

808
00:42:09,130 --> 00:42:12,333
- Giorgio's is
always doing well.

809
00:42:12,366 --> 00:42:13,200
Chess,

810
00:42:14,101 --> 00:42:15,469
gets busy at times,

811
00:42:15,504 --> 00:42:18,839
and then at other
times it's not as busy,

812
00:42:18,873 --> 00:42:21,342
but it's your
namesake restaurant,

813
00:42:21,375 --> 00:42:25,112
and it will be there for
as long as I'm there, so.

814
00:42:25,146 --> 00:42:26,414
- Wow.

815
00:42:26,447 --> 00:42:28,749
- How about you,
how's life outside?

816
00:42:28,783 --> 00:42:30,818
- Well, it's been
pretty good, you know.

817
00:42:30,851 --> 00:42:32,620
- I might go swimming.

818
00:42:32,653 --> 00:42:36,991
- I started my own kind
of ministry program,

819
00:42:37,024 --> 00:42:37,858
because,

820
00:42:38,859 --> 00:42:40,361
I mean,

821
00:42:40,394 --> 00:42:42,496
you know how long it took
me to get my act together,

822
00:42:42,531 --> 00:42:47,001
and it really helps me a
lot to help other people,

823
00:42:47,034 --> 00:42:50,271
and you know, I discovered
once I got sober

824
00:42:50,304 --> 00:42:52,239
that I was really
good at, you know,

825
00:42:52,273 --> 00:42:55,076
talking people off
a ledge so to speak.

826
00:42:55,109 --> 00:42:57,311
So that's kind of
what I put my mind to,

827
00:42:57,344 --> 00:43:00,448
and I started my
own rehab program.

828
00:43:00,481 --> 00:43:01,248
- Wow.

829
00:43:01,282 --> 00:43:02,450
- About eight people.

830
00:43:02,483 --> 00:43:03,384
- So you have your
own ministry program,

831
00:43:03,417 --> 00:43:05,653
and your own rehab program?

832
00:43:06,787 --> 00:43:08,622
- Yeah, I got close
to God in jail,

833
00:43:08,656 --> 00:43:10,157
and then when I got out,

834
00:43:10,191 --> 00:43:13,294
and I went through
AA and everything.

835
00:43:14,462 --> 00:43:17,331
I knew I had to change
my life because,

836
00:43:17,364 --> 00:43:18,833
I was gonna end up dead.

837
00:43:18,866 --> 00:43:22,269
I already was dead inside
for a lot of years.

838
00:43:22,303 --> 00:43:24,805
I mean, you know what it was
like growing up in this house.

839
00:43:24,839 --> 00:43:28,442
- Everybody finds God
in the foxhole, JR.

840
00:43:28,476 --> 00:43:30,411
- My whole life was a foxhole.

841
00:43:30,444 --> 00:43:31,612
- Well, it doesn't matter,

842
00:43:31,645 --> 00:43:33,647
as long as it's
what is helping him

843
00:43:33,681 --> 00:43:36,484
find meaning in his life,

844
00:43:36,518 --> 00:43:38,486
and staying on the
straight and narrow.

845
00:43:38,520 --> 00:43:39,653
If that's what's
doing it for you,

846
00:43:39,687 --> 00:43:41,455
I'm all for it, dude.

847
00:43:41,489 --> 00:43:42,557
- Well, I appreciate it,

848
00:43:42,591 --> 00:43:44,458
and I really
appreciate everything

849
00:43:44,492 --> 00:43:45,960
that you guys have done for me.

850
00:43:45,993 --> 00:43:48,229
I mean, you know, you should
have kicked me to the curb

851
00:43:48,262 --> 00:43:50,231
a long time ago probably.

852
00:43:50,264 --> 00:43:51,699
- Yeah, probably.

853
00:43:52,933 --> 00:43:54,135
- I deserved that.

854
00:43:54,168 --> 00:43:56,403
- You know, that's
what family is for,

855
00:43:56,437 --> 00:43:58,272
we're supposed to be, so,

856
00:43:58,305 --> 00:44:01,510
hopefully in this
round of family,

857
00:44:01,543 --> 00:44:04,579
we did a little
better and tried to.

858
00:44:04,613 --> 00:44:06,780
- Dad was no model father.

859
00:44:07,982 --> 00:44:10,651
And he wasn't really
there for any of us.

860
00:44:10,684 --> 00:44:14,688
- Speaking of that, I
hate to jump to this, but,

861
00:44:16,157 --> 00:44:18,058
I would just as soon take care
of the memories in this house

862
00:44:18,092 --> 00:44:20,427
by selling everything in it.

863
00:44:21,862 --> 00:44:25,634
- Big houses like this aren't
moving too well these days.

864
00:44:25,666 --> 00:44:28,202
I mean, most people
are minimalist.

865
00:44:28,235 --> 00:44:30,171
It's kind of hard to sell
a big place like this.

866
00:44:30,204 --> 00:44:31,105
- We'll do it.

867
00:44:31,138 --> 00:44:32,239
I think it needs to be done,

868
00:44:32,273 --> 00:44:35,176
everything and everything in it.

869
00:44:35,209 --> 00:44:37,978
- Well, I'd really rather
not sell the house.

870
00:44:38,012 --> 00:44:39,446
- I'm sorry?

871
00:44:39,480 --> 00:44:42,082
- Well, this place was a
nightmare growing up for me.

872
00:44:42,116 --> 00:44:46,954
I've got a really great family
now, and we like the area.

873
00:44:46,987 --> 00:44:49,890
I'd like to move
my family in here,

874
00:44:49,924 --> 00:44:51,560
you know, I don't
care about the stuff.

875
00:44:51,593 --> 00:44:53,595
- Nightmare for you, you
were hardly in the house.

876
00:44:53,628 --> 00:44:55,630
I grew up in this house.

877
00:44:56,730 --> 00:44:58,165
- This house?

878
00:44:58,199 --> 00:45:00,334
- I had to leave this house
because all that drama.

879
00:45:00,367 --> 00:45:01,536
- You had to leave
because of the way

880
00:45:01,570 --> 00:45:04,673
you spent your childhood, JR.

881
00:45:04,705 --> 00:45:06,541
I am sorry to bring this up,

882
00:45:06,575 --> 00:45:09,410
but I floated you
for a long time.

883
00:45:10,645 --> 00:45:13,615
I want nothing in this house.

884
00:45:13,648 --> 00:45:16,817
Now, if you'd like to buy me
out, I am happy to discuss it,

885
00:45:16,850 --> 00:45:19,019
including what you owe me.

886
00:45:20,888 --> 00:45:23,490
But I was happy to help you,

887
00:45:23,525 --> 00:45:25,560
I'm happy where you are,

888
00:45:25,594 --> 00:45:27,795
but I want to never
come back to this house.

889
00:45:27,828 --> 00:45:29,830
I'd like to never
see this house again.

890
00:45:29,863 --> 00:45:32,166
- Well, that's your prerogative,

891
00:45:32,199 --> 00:45:34,868
but I have a different
perspective on it,

892
00:45:34,902 --> 00:45:36,937
and I think I did
the things I did

893
00:45:36,971 --> 00:45:38,872
because of the family
that I grew up in.

894
00:45:38,906 --> 00:45:41,275
- Then you should want to get
rid of this house as well.

895
00:45:41,308 --> 00:45:43,545
- But I don't want
to get rid of it.

896
00:45:43,578 --> 00:45:44,979
- Why?

897
00:45:45,012 --> 00:45:47,381
- Look, I don't mind
buying out your interest,

898
00:45:47,414 --> 00:45:49,917
but I don't mind staying here.

899
00:45:53,220 --> 00:45:55,089
If I buy you out,
what is the problem?

900
00:45:55,122 --> 00:45:56,991
- It's okay by me.

901
00:45:57,024 --> 00:45:58,225
- I'm just having
trouble understanding

902
00:45:58,259 --> 00:46:00,695
why he would wanna
stay in this house.

903
00:46:00,729 --> 00:46:02,631
I mean, don't you
wanna go somewhere else

904
00:46:02,664 --> 00:46:05,366
and start a new life with Anna?

905
00:46:05,399 --> 00:46:07,636
- I already started a new life,

906
00:46:07,669 --> 00:46:10,739
and this house has
nothing to do with it.

907
00:46:10,771 --> 00:46:14,108
I'd like to make this place
a place of happy memories,

908
00:46:14,141 --> 00:46:15,976
forget about the past.

909
00:46:17,278 --> 00:46:19,346
I mean, I lost my wife Rhonda.

910
00:46:19,380 --> 00:46:23,518
I spent almost half
of my life in prison.

911
00:46:23,551 --> 00:46:25,452
That's why I got this
commemorative tattoo

912
00:46:25,486 --> 00:46:28,455
to celebrate my
freedom and new life.

913
00:46:28,489 --> 00:46:32,159
- JR, we know you've been
through a really rough time,

914
00:46:32,192 --> 00:46:33,794
but you have come
out on the other side

915
00:46:33,827 --> 00:46:35,996
and no one is happier
about that than me,

916
00:46:36,030 --> 00:46:39,768
but, I'm not sure
if you really know

917
00:46:39,800 --> 00:46:43,203
what you're getting into when
you move into this house.

918
00:46:43,237 --> 00:46:44,706
- Hang on, hang on,

919
00:46:44,739 --> 00:46:46,840
I need to take this call.

920
00:46:57,519 --> 00:46:59,654
- Are you still trying to
make sense of that note?

921
00:46:59,688 --> 00:47:00,522
- Yes.

922
00:47:02,423 --> 00:47:07,194
My gosh, the man finally speaks
something to me, and it's

923
00:47:08,530 --> 00:47:10,632
impossible to understand.

924
00:47:11,733 --> 00:47:14,034
What are those treasures?

925
00:47:14,068 --> 00:47:16,904
Look, what are those
treasure chest things.

926
00:47:16,937 --> 00:47:19,173
- Oh, the yellow thing and
the blue thing next to it?

927
00:47:19,206 --> 00:47:20,575
- Yeah.
- Go, go, go, go,

928
00:47:20,608 --> 00:47:21,875
go look at it.

929
00:47:21,909 --> 00:47:23,611
- What is it?
- Go, go, go, go look at it.

930
00:47:23,645 --> 00:47:25,312
It's fun, I promise you.

931
00:47:26,681 --> 00:47:27,682
Hey, come on in.

932
00:47:27,716 --> 00:47:29,684
- Looking for a party.

933
00:47:29,718 --> 00:47:31,318
- Hey, you found right place,

934
00:47:31,352 --> 00:47:32,787
you found the right place.

935
00:47:32,821 --> 00:47:34,088
- Wow, it still
looks like the party room.

936
00:47:34,121 --> 00:47:35,289
- I know,

937
00:47:35,322 --> 00:47:37,091
was your room the same?
- Just like always.

938
00:47:37,124 --> 00:47:38,793
- Clay, was your room the same?

939
00:47:38,827 --> 00:47:40,361
- You know, my room
was like a closet.

940
00:47:40,394 --> 00:47:41,895
- Wow.

941
00:47:41,929 --> 00:47:45,199
- The closet I didn't come out
of for a long time, remember?

942
00:47:45,232 --> 00:47:48,502
How we used to talk about that.

943
00:47:48,536 --> 00:47:49,738
- Look at this.

944
00:47:49,771 --> 00:47:50,705
- Black sheep is back.

945
00:47:50,739 --> 00:47:51,539
- Hey.

946
00:47:51,573 --> 00:47:52,741
- Hey.

947
00:47:54,776 --> 00:47:56,611
- Uncle JR.

948
00:47:56,644 --> 00:48:00,180
- Wow, I can't believe those
records are still here.

949
00:48:00,214 --> 00:48:01,616
- Why not?

950
00:48:01,649 --> 00:48:02,883
- Let me figure out.

951
00:48:02,916 --> 00:48:06,120
- Those things might
be worth something.

952
00:48:06,153 --> 00:48:08,021
- I can't imagine,

953
00:48:08,055 --> 00:48:10,592
you two love, love, love.

954
00:48:10,625 --> 00:48:12,192
- They changed nothing
about your room.

955
00:48:12,226 --> 00:48:13,127
- You know what?

956
00:48:13,160 --> 00:48:14,361
I think we have a lucky one.

957
00:48:14,395 --> 00:48:15,797
- Do you know
how to use that thing?

958
00:48:15,830 --> 00:48:16,997
- Yeah, she
may need your help.

959
00:48:17,030 --> 00:48:18,232
- You want the
homophobe to show you?

960
00:48:18,265 --> 00:48:19,500
- She may
need your help.

961
00:48:19,534 --> 00:48:22,837
- I think I may need
your help, Uncle JR.

962
00:48:22,871 --> 00:48:25,072
- Do you ever ride still?

963
00:48:25,105 --> 00:48:27,040
- Not here, no.

964
00:48:28,242 --> 00:48:31,546
but I have some really big dogs.

965
00:48:31,579 --> 00:48:33,213
- Can't ride those.

966
00:48:33,247 --> 00:48:34,749
- Just to
remind you of those.

967
00:48:34,783 --> 00:48:35,617
- Not unless I hated them.

968
00:48:35,650 --> 00:48:37,117
- Oh my gosh.

969
00:48:37,151 --> 00:48:38,919
- And really.

970
00:48:40,588 --> 00:48:41,989
- Wow, that song.

971
00:48:43,658 --> 00:48:44,958
- Yeah.

That wasn't exactly a good

978
00:49:01,041 --> 00:49:01,942
- I'm sorry.

979
00:49:01,975 --> 00:49:03,277
- We should do it this way.

980
00:49:03,310 --> 00:49:04,211
- I'll be over here.

981
00:49:04,244 --> 00:49:06,380
- Wait, you have a tattoo?

982
00:49:07,314 --> 00:49:09,517
I always wanted a tattoo.

983
00:49:09,551 --> 00:49:12,419
Well, I'm not really into 'em.

984
00:49:12,453 --> 00:49:13,855
- Do what?

985
00:49:13,888 --> 00:49:15,590
- I love art mom.

986
00:49:15,623 --> 00:49:17,024
- I like your pants by the way.

987
00:49:18,292 --> 00:49:20,160
- What in the world
is someone doing here?

988
00:49:20,194 --> 00:49:22,697
Thought everyone
was already here.

989
00:49:29,804 --> 00:49:30,638
- Hello?

990
00:49:31,639 --> 00:49:32,473
- Hello,

991
00:49:33,508 --> 00:49:34,776
please come in.

992
00:49:36,343 --> 00:49:38,880
Oh, let me help you with that.

993
00:49:38,913 --> 00:49:40,915
Lola, please do come in.

994
00:49:41,883 --> 00:49:42,784
You must be Gwen?

995
00:49:42,817 --> 00:49:43,785
- Yes,

996
00:49:43,818 --> 00:49:44,719
that is me.

997
00:49:46,487 --> 00:49:48,989
- It's a pleasure to meet you.

998
00:49:50,558 --> 00:49:52,326
How was your journey?

999
00:49:52,359 --> 00:49:53,227
- Fine.

1000
00:49:53,260 --> 00:49:54,061
- It was good.

1001
00:49:54,094 --> 00:49:55,930
- Good.

1002
00:49:55,964 --> 00:49:57,799
- How is Hudson doing?

1003
00:49:58,867 --> 00:49:59,701
- He is

1004
00:50:01,536 --> 00:50:04,639
coming towards the
end, shall we say.

1005
00:50:05,740 --> 00:50:07,174
Forgive me,

1006
00:50:07,207 --> 00:50:08,743
I didn't introduce myself.

1007
00:50:08,776 --> 00:50:10,745
My name is Kent Barber.

1008
00:50:10,778 --> 00:50:14,114
I am Hudson's palliative
care assistant.

1009
00:50:17,552 --> 00:50:20,420
Yes, I'm here to improve
his quality of life,

1010
00:50:20,454 --> 00:50:23,725
and to help him in
whatever he needs,

1011
00:50:23,758 --> 00:50:26,794
and one of the things
that we've got to do

1012
00:50:26,828 --> 00:50:30,632
before you have access
to the house is,

1013
00:50:30,665 --> 00:50:35,168
to sign a small piece of
paperwork that he's drawn up.

1014
00:50:36,436 --> 00:50:38,706
We will need to
go into the study.

1015
00:50:38,740 --> 00:50:40,274
Do you remember
where the study is?

1016
00:50:40,307 --> 00:50:42,376
- Yes I do,

1017
00:50:42,409 --> 00:50:43,210
of course.

1018
00:50:45,479 --> 00:50:47,214
So many memories.

1019
00:50:47,247 --> 00:50:48,883
- Oh darling.

1020
00:50:51,853 --> 00:50:54,488
- You know who the
hell they were?

1021
00:50:54,522 --> 00:50:55,523
- I figured you guys might.

1022
00:50:55,557 --> 00:50:56,490
- Who is that?

1023
00:50:56,524 --> 00:50:58,358
Did you recognize her? No.

1024
00:50:58,392 --> 00:50:59,961
Did you recognize?

1025
00:50:59,994 --> 00:51:01,663
- How many surprises
are we going to get

1026
00:51:01,696 --> 00:51:02,864
on this little visit?

1027
00:51:02,897 --> 00:51:04,832
- The older one looked
a little familiar,

1028
00:51:04,866 --> 00:51:07,802
- This has something
to do with Kent

1029
00:51:07,835 --> 00:51:09,604
and the whole
transaction, I'm sure.

1030
00:51:09,637 --> 00:51:12,272
- That Kent is pissing me off.

1031
00:51:12,306 --> 00:51:13,140
What,

1032
00:51:14,042 --> 00:51:14,842
freaking.

1033
00:51:14,876 --> 00:51:16,611
- Hey do you,

1034
00:51:16,644 --> 00:51:17,679
do guys wanna know.
- Don't let him get to you,

1035
00:51:17,712 --> 00:51:19,179
he's just doing his job.

1036
00:51:19,212 --> 00:51:20,048
- Actually you know what,
you guys just hang out here.

1037
00:51:20,080 --> 00:51:20,982
- What is his job,

1038
00:51:21,015 --> 00:51:21,916
is his job to me piss me off?

1039
00:51:21,950 --> 00:51:23,918
'Cause his doing his job.

1040
00:51:23,952 --> 00:51:25,954
- Lets talk, let's talk.

1041
00:51:30,457 --> 00:51:32,459
We have got to figure this out.

1042
00:51:32,492 --> 00:51:33,761
- Who's that?

1043
00:51:33,795 --> 00:51:37,397
- I don't have a clue
who those women are.

1044
00:51:37,431 --> 00:51:38,633
- Just,

1045
00:51:38,666 --> 00:51:41,268
she's the one who's been
decorating this house.

1046
00:51:41,301 --> 00:51:44,204
She's like dad's
girlfriend or something.

1047
00:51:44,237 --> 00:51:46,340
I mean, look at this house.

1048
00:51:46,373 --> 00:51:49,176
He didn't decorate
this house, it's all.

1049
00:51:49,209 --> 00:51:51,378
- All I care about is
whether he gave someone else

1050
00:51:51,411 --> 00:51:53,413
power of attorney,

1051
00:51:53,447 --> 00:51:56,116
and if someone
else holds the key

1052
00:51:56,149 --> 00:51:57,685
to everything that's
happening here.

1053
00:51:57,719 --> 00:51:58,953
- He wouldn't do.

1054
00:51:58,987 --> 00:52:00,454
- And that doesn't
come from greed,

1055
00:52:00,487 --> 00:52:01,723
I just don't want arguments,

1056
00:52:01,756 --> 00:52:03,725
I don't want any more conflict.

1057
00:52:03,758 --> 00:52:06,226
I just want this settled.

1058
00:52:06,259 --> 00:52:07,762
- Why are we here?

1059
00:52:08,763 --> 00:52:11,164
Well, I know why we are here.

1060
00:52:12,165 --> 00:52:13,166
- Yeah.

1061
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:14,035
- But,

1062
00:52:15,036 --> 00:52:16,738
there's so much else going on,

1063
00:52:16,771 --> 00:52:19,774
so, I don't know
if we are going to,

1064
00:52:21,375 --> 00:52:22,309
you know?

1065
00:52:22,342 --> 00:52:24,846
- It's probably not a good time.

1066
00:52:24,879 --> 00:52:27,314
- No, I don't think so.

1067
00:52:27,347 --> 00:52:29,483
- We're gonna have to
hold it off a little bit.

1068
00:52:29,517 --> 00:52:30,585
A lot of bit.

1069
00:52:33,054 --> 00:52:36,991
Let's go see if we could
find out who that was.

1070
00:52:56,410 --> 00:52:57,210
- So,

1071
00:52:59,747 --> 00:53:02,150
so I've gotta stay
here for two days.

1072
00:53:02,182 --> 00:53:04,619
- 48 hours, exactly.

1073
00:53:04,652 --> 00:53:06,754
But unless you sign that,

1074
00:53:08,690 --> 00:53:11,125
you won't be allowed to
anywhere else in the house

1075
00:53:11,159 --> 00:53:13,226
and you'll need to leave.

1076
00:53:14,394 --> 00:53:16,631
But I don't want you to go.

1077
00:53:18,599 --> 00:53:21,435
- Okay, I'll go
ahead and sign it.

1078
00:53:34,048 --> 00:53:37,719
- You can leave your
luggage in the hallway.

1079
00:53:47,227 --> 00:53:48,228
There he is.

1080
00:53:50,098 --> 00:53:52,100
He's still aware of you,

1081
00:53:53,266 --> 00:53:55,636
even though he looks
like he's unconscious,

1082
00:53:55,670 --> 00:53:57,672
he's still aware of you.

1083
00:54:00,875 --> 00:54:03,010
Oh, if I could give
this to you Gwen

1084
00:54:03,044 --> 00:54:05,245
and just present it to
him in however you feel

1085
00:54:05,278 --> 00:54:07,715
is appropriate and necessary,

1086
00:54:10,383 --> 00:54:13,621
then the contract
would be completed.

1087
00:54:13,654 --> 00:54:15,923
- So, Hudson you want me to

1088
00:54:18,226 --> 00:54:19,060
stay here

1089
00:54:20,427 --> 00:54:22,697
for two days, for 48 hours,

1090
00:54:28,703 --> 00:54:32,073
and you want me to come
and see you every morning

1091
00:54:32,106 --> 00:54:33,608
and every evening,

1092
00:54:35,275 --> 00:54:37,344
and I'll do that, I will.

1093
00:54:43,251 --> 00:54:44,152
- And I'll come see you

1094
00:54:44,185 --> 00:54:46,754
every morning and every evening,

1095
00:54:50,457 --> 00:54:52,193
and I do forgive you.

1096
00:54:54,595 --> 00:54:55,495
- Gwen?

1097
00:54:55,530 --> 00:54:56,697
Lola?

1098
00:54:56,731 --> 00:54:59,399
You must be very tired
from your journey.

1099
00:54:59,432 --> 00:55:02,502
Please help yourself do
anything in the kitchen.

1100
00:55:02,537 --> 00:55:04,471
- Maybe if we find out,

1101
00:55:06,174 --> 00:55:07,608
if we get to the bottom of this.

1102
00:55:07,642 --> 00:55:09,076
- But the only way
we're gonna find out

1103
00:55:09,110 --> 00:55:11,078
is to go down there and
find out together right now.

1104
00:55:11,112 --> 00:55:13,047
- Do you wanna confront her?

1105
00:55:13,080 --> 00:55:14,982
- It doesn't bother me.

1106
00:55:15,016 --> 00:55:15,883
I've confronted.

1107
00:55:18,186 --> 00:55:20,254
- Hey, we figured it out.

1108
00:55:21,155 --> 00:55:22,824
- Gwen and Lola.

1109
00:55:22,857 --> 00:55:23,658
- Gwen.

1110
00:55:23,691 --> 00:55:24,491
- Lola.

1111
00:55:24,525 --> 00:55:25,325
- Aunt Lola.

1112
00:55:25,358 --> 00:55:26,994
- Yeah.

1113
00:55:27,028 --> 00:55:27,829
- Yeah.

1114
00:55:27,862 --> 00:55:29,130
- Aunt Lola?

1115
00:55:29,163 --> 00:55:32,200
Who would this
person be with her?

1116
00:55:32,233 --> 00:55:33,466
- I don't know.

1117
00:55:33,500 --> 00:55:35,570
- I don't know but I got
some things to ask her.

1118
00:55:35,603 --> 00:55:38,039
- I haven't heard
a peep from Lola

1119
00:55:38,072 --> 00:55:40,041
since she left this house.

1120
00:55:40,074 --> 00:55:40,975
- Nor have I.

1121
00:55:41,008 --> 00:55:43,077
- Abandoned me as a child.

1122
00:55:45,246 --> 00:55:47,582
I kind of blame her for some
of the stuff I got into.

1123
00:55:47,615 --> 00:55:50,218
- Okay, okay, we
have to find out.

1124
00:55:50,251 --> 00:55:51,552
Did you hear anything else?

1125
00:55:51,586 --> 00:55:52,620
Did they say anything else?

1126
00:55:52,653 --> 00:55:53,453
- Not really, no.

1127
00:55:53,486 --> 00:55:54,789
- Wait, why are we

1128
00:55:54,822 --> 00:55:56,958
sitting here?
- We just heard the names.

1129
00:55:56,991 --> 00:55:58,125
- After all these years

1130
00:55:58,159 --> 00:56:00,127
and they're here because
they were invited,

1131
00:56:00,161 --> 00:56:01,863
so why would he invite her?

1132
00:56:01,896 --> 00:56:03,064
With, who is she with?

1133
00:56:03,097 --> 00:56:03,898
- And when?

1134
00:56:03,931 --> 00:56:05,099
- How and that.

1135
00:56:05,132 --> 00:56:06,033
- If he's in the state
that he's in now,

1136
00:56:06,067 --> 00:56:07,268
when did this all happen?

1137
00:56:07,301 --> 00:56:09,670
- I wanna know why she
left in the first place.

1138
00:56:09,704 --> 00:56:11,105
- I mean, we all were invited.

1139
00:56:11,138 --> 00:56:13,808
- Hated him or us or
whatever enough to leave,

1140
00:56:13,841 --> 00:56:14,976
why would she come back?

1141
00:56:15,009 --> 00:56:16,244
Unless she's greedy
and she wants.

1142
00:56:16,277 --> 00:56:17,345
- Aunt Lola?

1143
00:56:17,377 --> 00:56:18,279
Aunt Lola?

1144
00:56:18,312 --> 00:56:20,114
- She does not get to leave us

1145
00:56:20,147 --> 00:56:22,049
and then waltz back
in the last minute

1146
00:56:22,083 --> 00:56:23,284
and pick up the pieces.

1147
00:56:23,317 --> 00:56:25,987
- Do you guys know why she left?

1148
00:56:27,021 --> 00:56:29,489
- I have no idea why she left.

1149
00:56:29,523 --> 00:56:30,324
- I don't either.

1150
00:56:30,358 --> 00:56:31,559
- Well I do,

1151
00:56:31,592 --> 00:56:33,661
but I wanna find out who
this other person is.

1152
00:56:33,694 --> 00:56:34,962
- Clay.

1153
00:56:34,996 --> 00:56:37,698
- Let's go.
- Clay, why did she leave?

1154
00:56:37,732 --> 00:56:39,066
- Say that again.

1155
00:56:39,100 --> 00:56:40,268
- The house hasn't
changed at all.

1156
00:56:40,301 --> 00:56:43,104
- I don't think
it's changed, look.

1157
00:56:44,272 --> 00:56:46,574
- Well, Aunt Lola, can
you imagine my surprise

1158
00:56:46,607 --> 00:56:49,143
to see you after
all these years?

1159
00:56:49,176 --> 00:56:50,044
- How are you,

1160
00:56:50,077 --> 00:56:51,012
how are you Clay?

1161
00:56:51,045 --> 00:56:52,280
- You think you're surprised?

1162
00:56:52,313 --> 00:56:53,948
- But I'm a little
stunned Aunt Lola.

1163
00:56:53,981 --> 00:56:55,383
- Why are you here?

1164
00:56:55,415 --> 00:56:56,851
- JR.

1165
00:56:56,884 --> 00:56:59,120
- Don't touch me, you
ran off and abandoned me.

1166
00:56:59,153 --> 00:57:00,621
- Easy, easy JR,

1167
00:57:00,655 --> 00:57:02,723
let's just find out
what's going on.

1168
00:57:02,757 --> 00:57:05,092
Excuse me, who are you?

1169
00:57:05,126 --> 00:57:07,061
- Chess, Chess.

1170
00:57:07,094 --> 00:57:09,664
- I am the one that
brought Lola with me.

1171
00:57:09,697 --> 00:57:12,465
- And who are you?
- She's my guest.

1172
00:57:12,499 --> 00:57:14,434
I am Hudson's daughter.

1173
00:57:16,469 --> 00:57:17,605
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry,

1174
00:57:17,638 --> 00:57:18,940
Chess,

1175
00:57:18,973 --> 00:57:19,774
excuse me.

1176
00:57:19,807 --> 00:57:22,276
- Hudson is my father.

1177
00:57:22,310 --> 00:57:23,911
- Hudson is your father?

1178
00:57:23,945 --> 00:57:25,579
- Yes,

1179
00:57:25,613 --> 00:57:27,447
that means that
you're my siblings.

1180
00:57:27,480 --> 00:57:28,416
- With who?

1181
00:57:29,482 --> 00:57:30,318
- Who's your mother?

1182
00:57:30,351 --> 00:57:32,119
- You can ask Hudson.

1183
00:57:32,153 --> 00:57:34,188
- No, actually we can't,

1184
00:57:34,221 --> 00:57:36,390
because he's dying upstairs,

1185
00:57:36,424 --> 00:57:38,526
and you come up out of nowhere.

1186
00:57:38,559 --> 00:57:39,794
We don't know who you are.

1187
00:57:39,827 --> 00:57:40,995
- You're just a gold digger

1188
00:57:41,028 --> 00:57:41,796
looking for our money.
- Why you're here

1189
00:57:41,829 --> 00:57:42,964
and what you want.

1190
00:57:42,997 --> 00:57:44,298
- If I was a gold digger,

1191
00:57:44,332 --> 00:57:47,068
then why would Hudson
invite me here?

1192
00:57:47,101 --> 00:57:48,602
- We don't know that
he invited you here,

1193
00:57:48,636 --> 00:57:50,905
can you prove what you say?

1194
00:57:52,073 --> 00:57:53,040
- Why are you here?

1195
00:57:53,074 --> 00:57:54,308
- And what do you have to do

1196
00:57:54,342 --> 00:57:56,978
with her, Aunt Lola?
- She is my guest.

1197
00:57:57,011 --> 00:57:58,379
- Yeah, we got
that he first time,

1198
00:57:58,412 --> 00:58:00,514
that explains nothing.

1199
00:58:00,548 --> 00:58:03,483
- Clay, Aunt Lola,
why are you here?

1200
00:58:04,852 --> 00:58:06,587
Why after all these
years have you come back?

1201
00:58:06,620 --> 00:58:08,289
- I missed you, I missed you

1202
00:58:08,322 --> 00:58:09,890
you know, I missed you.

1203
00:58:09,924 --> 00:58:11,125
- Really?

1204
00:58:11,158 --> 00:58:12,426
- You missed me so much
that you just ran off

1205
00:58:12,460 --> 00:58:14,762
and left me when
I was just a kid.

1206
00:58:14,795 --> 00:58:15,796
- Oh, I'm sorry, I'm sorry,

1207
00:58:15,830 --> 00:58:17,331
but I just had to,

1208
00:58:18,366 --> 00:58:19,867
I had to go, I had to go.

1209
00:58:21,969 --> 00:58:23,971
- Ladies and gentlemen.

1210
00:58:24,005 --> 00:58:26,874
Today, well, now at this time,

1211
00:58:26,907 --> 00:58:30,911
Hudson is requiring you
to keep the volume down.

1212
00:58:32,079 --> 00:58:34,015
- I thought he was
unresponsive right now?

1213
00:58:34,048 --> 00:58:35,850
- He is aware of things
that are going on,

1214
00:58:35,883 --> 00:58:37,051
he may have end stage dementia,

1215
00:58:37,084 --> 00:58:38,786
but it doesn't mean
he's completely unaware

1216
00:58:38,819 --> 00:58:40,588
and completely comatose.

1217
00:58:40,621 --> 00:58:42,623
So, if we could
keep the volume down

1218
00:58:42,656 --> 00:58:46,394
and go up to the bedroom
as per his requests.

1219
00:58:46,427 --> 00:58:47,895
- You're pretty loud yourself.

1220
00:58:47,928 --> 00:58:50,364
- Well, you need to be
loud over certain people.

1221
00:58:50,398 --> 00:58:54,068
- Maybe you could actually
explain who this person is,

1222
00:58:54,101 --> 00:58:55,002
how she got here.

1223
00:58:55,036 --> 00:58:55,936
- I already told you who I am.

1224
00:58:55,970 --> 00:58:57,171
- And what she has do with all.

1225
00:58:57,204 --> 00:58:59,273
- I told you that
Hudson is my father.

1226
00:58:59,306 --> 00:59:01,542
I don't care if you believe me?

1227
00:59:01,575 --> 00:59:04,445
- I said it is
important to be quiet

1228
00:59:04,478 --> 00:59:07,248
and not be banging
tables please.

1229
00:59:07,281 --> 00:59:08,482
- Children, children.

1230
00:59:08,517 --> 00:59:09,283
- I have to agree
with Kent right now,

1231
00:59:09,316 --> 00:59:10,384
dad is very sick.

1232
00:59:10,418 --> 00:59:11,218
- Thank you.

1233
00:59:11,252 --> 00:59:12,586
- So let's just chill.

1234
00:59:14,789 --> 00:59:16,557
- This is a meeting
that involves a will

1235
00:59:16,590 --> 00:59:19,193
and there is someone
here that doesn't belong.

1236
00:59:19,226 --> 00:59:20,529
- All will be revealed in time.

1237
00:59:20,561 --> 00:59:21,929
- That is not for you to say

1238
00:59:21,962 --> 00:59:23,164
that I do belong.
- If we could be grown ups

1239
00:59:23,197 --> 00:59:25,866
about this, and not
spoiled children,

1240
00:59:25,900 --> 00:59:27,835
then that would be
very beneficial.

1241
00:59:27,868 --> 00:59:30,638
- Kent, we are having
a family moment here,

1242
00:59:30,671 --> 00:59:33,607
that as far as I can tell
has nothing to do with you,

1243
00:59:33,641 --> 00:59:35,342
so if you could please leave.

1244
00:59:35,376 --> 00:59:37,945
I understand,
we'll keep it down.

1245
00:59:37,978 --> 00:59:38,779
- Francesca.

1246
00:59:38,813 --> 00:59:39,713
- But I need you to,

1247
00:59:39,747 --> 00:59:42,316
call me Francesca one more time!

1248
00:59:43,518 --> 00:59:44,418
- Relax.

1249
00:59:44,452 --> 00:59:45,920
- Your father is very ill.

1250
00:59:45,953 --> 00:59:48,155
- You're getting your blood
pressure up for no reason.

1251
00:59:48,189 --> 00:59:49,490
- Chess quit.

1252
00:59:49,524 --> 00:59:50,758
- Your father is very ill.

1253
00:59:50,791 --> 00:59:53,160
- I am aware of my
father being ill,

1254
00:59:53,194 --> 00:59:54,829
I saw him.
- It doesn't sound like it.

1255
00:59:54,862 --> 00:59:56,931
- Can you please leave us alone?

1256
00:59:56,964 --> 00:59:58,265
We have a family moment.

1257
00:59:58,299 --> 01:00:01,635
- I am here to exact
your father wishes.

1258
01:00:02,837 --> 01:00:05,606
- Okay, all right, all
right, enough, enough.

1259
01:00:05,639 --> 01:00:07,074
- We will go up

1260
01:00:07,108 --> 01:00:08,008
and we will say goodnight.
- Thank you very much.

1261
01:00:08,042 --> 01:00:09,243
- Then when we come back,

1262
01:00:09,276 --> 01:00:11,679
since you are the holder
of all the knowledge,

1263
01:00:11,712 --> 01:00:15,683
you will tell us what the
hell is going on here.

1264
01:00:15,716 --> 01:00:19,987
- I will do my utmost to
make the peace last, okay?

1265
01:00:21,288 --> 01:00:23,657
If you could follow me
up then to the bedroom,

1266
01:00:23,691 --> 01:00:25,092
that would be excellent,

1267
01:00:25,126 --> 01:00:28,597
I'm sure your father
will be very, very happy.

1268
01:00:28,629 --> 01:00:32,433
He only wishes for goodness
and happiness to prevail.

1269
01:00:32,466 --> 01:00:33,400
- Let's just

1270
01:00:33,434 --> 01:00:34,668
get up there.
- I've gotta go.

1271
01:00:34,702 --> 01:00:36,571
- So we can get
to the bottom of this.

1272
01:00:36,605 --> 01:00:39,206
- Chess, you need to
go upstairs with us.

1273
01:00:39,240 --> 01:00:44,211
- Remember he's asleep, so
please do bear that in mind.

1274
01:00:45,112 --> 01:00:47,214
Take your place around his bed.

1275
01:00:48,215 --> 01:00:50,519
Sure that he's aware of you,

1276
01:00:52,186 --> 01:00:53,487
cares about you,

1277
01:00:55,389 --> 01:00:58,058
and if we could just
give a moment of silence,

1278
01:00:58,092 --> 01:01:00,394
just the thoughts that
may come into your head,

1279
01:01:00,427 --> 01:01:02,897
just let them happen,

1280
01:01:02,930 --> 01:01:04,265
be present with him,

1281
01:01:04,298 --> 01:01:07,301
he's present with
you at all times,

1282
01:01:07,334 --> 01:01:11,506
so if we could just
keep that in your mind,

1283
01:01:11,540 --> 01:01:13,240
very grateful.

1284
01:01:13,274 --> 01:01:17,344
- Oh Hudson, I can't keep
it a secret any longer.

1285
01:01:19,648 --> 01:01:20,481
Chess, JR,

1286
01:01:22,183 --> 01:01:23,751
Clay,

1287
01:01:23,784 --> 01:01:26,287
you deserve to know the truth.

1288
01:01:27,488 --> 01:01:30,391
I know I left you all
those long years ago

1289
01:01:30,424 --> 01:01:33,494
and you have every
right to be angry,

1290
01:01:34,629 --> 01:01:36,463
but I had to leave,

1291
01:01:36,497 --> 01:01:37,331
I had to.

1292
01:01:39,867 --> 01:01:43,704
You see, your father and
I had fallen in love.

1293
01:01:46,273 --> 01:01:49,343
We even talked about
getting married.

1294
01:01:51,478 --> 01:01:53,548
That last night when I left,

1295
01:01:53,582 --> 01:01:55,983
there was a terrible argument,

1296
01:01:56,016 --> 01:01:58,587
I have never seen him so angry.

1297
01:02:00,321 --> 01:02:01,355
He pushed me.

1298
01:02:02,323 --> 01:02:05,326
He wouldn't listen to reason.

1299
01:02:05,359 --> 01:02:07,529
He said I had two choices,

1300
01:02:08,697 --> 01:02:12,634
I could either do what
he wanted me to do,

1301
01:02:12,667 --> 01:02:15,604
or I had to leave
his home forever,

1302
01:02:16,605 --> 01:02:17,438
so I left.

1303
01:02:22,476 --> 01:02:26,146
It was only a few
weeks after that,

1304
01:02:26,180 --> 01:02:29,684
that I found out I was
carrying his child.

1305
01:02:32,520 --> 01:02:34,288
Gwen is our daughter.

1306
01:02:36,123 --> 01:02:41,128
I never wanted him to find
out about her, never, never.

1307
01:02:41,996 --> 01:02:43,598
- So you're Gwendolyn Spencer?

1308
01:02:43,632 --> 01:02:45,533
- Yes.

1309
01:02:45,567 --> 01:02:48,135
- So you are a gold digger?

1310
01:02:48,168 --> 01:02:49,370
- No.

1311
01:02:49,403 --> 01:02:50,938
- Oh, she's our
sister, all right.

1312
01:02:50,971 --> 01:02:52,206
- Yes.

1313
01:02:52,239 --> 01:02:53,407
- Because I've been
running dad's business

1314
01:02:53,440 --> 01:02:55,109
for the last five years,

1315
01:02:55,142 --> 01:02:56,678
and I discovered
from a paper trail

1316
01:02:56,711 --> 01:02:59,280
that he's paid you
over a million dollars,

1317
01:02:59,313 --> 01:03:02,816
and you are not supposed
to be in the will.

1318
01:03:02,850 --> 01:03:04,151
- I am in the will though,

1319
01:03:04,184 --> 01:03:07,354
and he's the one
that invited me here.

1320
01:03:08,956 --> 01:03:11,458
- That was quite
the performance.

1321
01:03:11,492 --> 01:03:12,761
When were you going to tell us

1322
01:03:12,793 --> 01:03:16,665
that our mother's sister
is our sister's mother?

1323
01:03:16,698 --> 01:03:18,866
When were you gonna tell
us about your involvement?

1324
01:03:18,899 --> 01:03:20,769
When were you gonna
tell us about all this?

1325
01:03:20,801 --> 01:03:22,604
Now this is when you tell us?

1326
01:03:22,637 --> 01:03:24,639
- Dad didn't want
anyone to know.

1327
01:03:24,673 --> 01:03:27,308
- Oh, dad didn't
want anybody to know.

1328
01:03:27,341 --> 01:03:29,977
He never wanted anybody
to know anything,

1329
01:03:30,010 --> 01:03:32,747
but we took care of you,

1330
01:03:32,781 --> 01:03:34,948
not him, we did that.

1331
01:03:34,982 --> 01:03:36,216
- That's right,

1332
01:03:36,250 --> 01:03:38,218
and he helped you a lot too,

1333
01:03:38,252 --> 01:03:39,453
whether you know it or not,

1334
01:03:39,486 --> 01:03:40,622
when you couldn't
buy that restaurant

1335
01:03:40,655 --> 01:03:41,822
because they were
prejudiced against you,

1336
01:03:41,855 --> 01:03:43,457
because you were gay,

1337
01:03:43,490 --> 01:03:45,926
he stepped in and did that,

1338
01:03:45,959 --> 01:03:48,395
and they didn't wanna let you
adopt because you were single,

1339
01:03:48,429 --> 01:03:50,598
dad stepped in and did that too.

1340
01:03:50,632 --> 01:03:52,667
- So I'm supposed
to be grateful,

1341
01:03:52,701 --> 01:03:55,469
grateful because he
almighty Hudson Mills Graham

1342
01:03:55,502 --> 01:03:59,373
interfered and used his money
to manipulate all of us?

1343
01:03:59,406 --> 01:04:01,743
What a grand puppet master.

1344
01:04:01,776 --> 01:04:03,444
- Oh, goodness.

1345
01:04:03,477 --> 01:04:06,480
Well, this has been quite
the touching family moment,

1346
01:04:06,514 --> 01:04:07,348
hasn't it?

1347
01:04:08,415 --> 01:04:11,553
It's time now to
retire for the evening.

1348
01:04:21,395 --> 01:04:23,531
- I can't eat anything,

1349
01:04:23,565 --> 01:04:25,866
the smell of it
makes me feel sick.

1350
01:04:25,899 --> 01:04:28,703
- Have some apple juice, babe.

1351
01:04:28,737 --> 01:04:31,673
Oh, you've got
some, I've got some.

1352
01:04:32,906 --> 01:04:34,743
Have some apple juice?

1353
01:04:40,314 --> 01:04:42,149
Good morning.

1354
01:04:42,182 --> 01:04:43,585
- Good morning.

1355
01:05:25,092 --> 01:05:27,662
- So, this house is so big,

1356
01:05:27,695 --> 01:05:30,532
how many bedrooms
are there here?

1357
01:05:30,565 --> 01:05:32,299
- Anybody want granola?

1358
01:05:32,332 --> 01:05:33,133
Hmm?

1359
01:05:33,167 --> 01:05:34,368
- I'll take some.

1360
01:05:34,401 --> 01:05:36,136
- Of course you will.

1361
01:05:54,388 --> 01:05:58,492
- I did bring some
presents for you all.

1362
01:05:58,526 --> 01:06:01,495
Would you please
pass this to Chess?

1363
01:06:15,577 --> 01:06:16,744
- It's a bird,

1364
01:06:18,212 --> 01:06:19,046
is that,

1365
01:06:20,515 --> 01:06:21,916
is that a nightingale?

1366
01:06:21,950 --> 01:06:23,217
- Yes.

1367
01:06:23,250 --> 01:06:25,486
Remember when you
were a little child,

1368
01:06:25,520 --> 01:06:29,858
we always used to call you
Little Chess Nightingale.

1369
01:06:31,659 --> 01:06:33,393
- Why'd they call you that?

1370
01:06:33,427 --> 01:06:36,063
- She was always
dragging home injured animals.

1371
01:06:36,096 --> 01:06:39,233
- Yeah, and she often
saved some of them too.

1372
01:06:39,266 --> 01:06:40,501
- That's right,

1373
01:06:40,535 --> 01:06:43,972
we were hoping Chess
would become a vet.

1374
01:06:44,004 --> 01:06:44,839
- Hmm.

1375
01:06:46,608 --> 01:06:47,942
- This is for you Clay.

1376
01:06:47,976 --> 01:06:48,810
- Oh.

1377
01:06:56,851 --> 01:06:58,820
It's a pocket watch.

1378
01:06:58,853 --> 01:07:02,089
- It belonged to your granddad,

1379
01:07:02,122 --> 01:07:04,893
all for you, Little
White Rabbit.

1380
01:07:06,093 --> 01:07:07,695
- Oh, white rabbit,

1381
01:07:09,029 --> 01:07:11,633
like in Alice in Wonderland,
the book, remember?

1382
01:07:11,666 --> 01:07:12,499
Oh.

1383
01:07:13,400 --> 01:07:15,003
Whatever happened to that book?

1384
01:07:15,035 --> 01:07:16,938
- I gave it to Bronson.

1385
01:07:16,971 --> 01:07:17,772
- Aww.

1386
01:07:19,373 --> 01:07:20,207
- JR,

1387
01:07:21,910 --> 01:07:25,145
you know I would
never forget you.

1388
01:07:25,178 --> 01:07:26,514
This is for you.

1389
01:07:38,726 --> 01:07:41,495
- He shall guide thy path,

1390
01:07:41,529 --> 01:07:42,597
Proverbs 3:6,

1391
01:07:44,398 --> 01:07:45,900
a compass?

1392
01:07:45,934 --> 01:07:47,467
- A little something,

1393
01:07:47,501 --> 01:07:50,070
so you'll never get lost again.

1394
01:07:54,274 --> 01:07:56,243
- Thank you for the
gifts Aunt Lola.

1395
01:07:56,276 --> 01:07:58,846
It was very thoughtful of you.

1396
01:07:58,880 --> 01:08:03,483
- Oh, hey, and thank you for
the gift of our new sister.

1397
01:08:05,218 --> 01:08:07,187
- Speaking of witch,

1398
01:08:07,220 --> 01:08:09,924
I have a few
questions about that,

1399
01:08:09,958 --> 01:08:12,026
according to our new CEO,

1400
01:08:12,860 --> 01:08:14,028
JR, evidently,

1401
01:08:16,163 --> 01:08:17,932
Gwen signed some waivers

1402
01:08:17,966 --> 01:08:21,401
before she accepted
any funds from Hudson,

1403
01:08:21,435 --> 01:08:25,238
which means she forfeits
any right to an inheritance,

1404
01:08:25,272 --> 01:08:26,373
sister or no.

1405
01:08:27,274 --> 01:08:29,744
- My attorney disagrees.

1406
01:08:29,777 --> 01:08:33,380
He says the will voids
any prior agreement.

1407
01:08:34,749 --> 01:08:38,653
- And what exactly do you
expect to gain from being here?

1408
01:08:38,686 --> 01:08:39,621
You think you are owed something

1409
01:08:39,654 --> 01:08:42,023
because your mom's sister?

1410
01:08:42,056 --> 01:08:44,525
- I have no claim to the money.

1411
01:08:44,559 --> 01:08:46,828
Camille was like a sister to me,

1412
01:08:46,861 --> 01:08:49,831
but we were not
biological sisters.

1413
01:08:49,864 --> 01:08:54,869
Her parents took my brother and
I in after our parents died.

1414
01:08:56,037 --> 01:08:57,572
- So Gwen here is
your golden ticket?

1415
01:08:57,605 --> 01:08:59,007
- Yeah, exactly how
much will it take

1416
01:08:59,040 --> 01:09:01,109
to pay you off this time?

1417
01:09:01,976 --> 01:09:03,143
- I'll just take the house.

1418
01:09:03,176 --> 01:09:05,913
- Good morning, everyone.

1419
01:09:05,947 --> 01:09:07,782
I hope you slept well.

1420
01:09:09,717 --> 01:09:14,287
Your father is ready and
waiting for his morning visit.

1421
01:09:16,289 --> 01:09:20,394
Now, I heard you dividing
up the family property.

1422
01:09:22,864 --> 01:09:25,900
Do let me know if you
need any pens, pencils,

1423
01:09:25,933 --> 01:09:28,069
I have 2B or 2A,

1424
01:09:28,102 --> 01:09:29,637
had some architects drafting-

1425
01:09:29,671 --> 01:09:31,005
- Oh, shut up!

1426
01:09:31,039 --> 01:09:32,172
- Some paper.

1427
01:09:32,205 --> 01:09:34,876
- You sad little
wanker, just shut up!

1428
01:09:34,909 --> 01:09:37,945
I am tired of you antagonizing
my family like this,

1429
01:09:37,979 --> 01:09:38,813
you bully.

1430
01:09:40,247 --> 01:09:44,786
I don't know what Hudson has
paid you to do this to us.

1431
01:09:45,653 --> 01:09:46,988
Oh my God, you're a whore.

1432
01:09:53,360 --> 01:09:55,697
- Oh, so you want the house?

1433
01:09:56,831 --> 01:09:58,700
That means you two have
something in common,

1434
01:09:58,733 --> 01:10:03,403
so I'll just leave you to
discuss it amongst yourselves.

1435
01:10:04,539 --> 01:10:05,372
Oh.

1436
01:10:11,012 --> 01:10:13,346
- I've gotta take this call.

1437
01:10:15,049 --> 01:10:15,883
- Well,

1438
01:10:17,852 --> 01:10:19,620
that was tense,

1439
01:10:19,654 --> 01:10:20,888
wasn't it?

1440
01:10:20,922 --> 01:10:23,891
Well, if you're looking
for something fun to do,

1441
01:10:23,925 --> 01:10:28,261
there's a whole slew of
games in the family room,

1442
01:10:28,295 --> 01:10:30,898
and with that, I bid you adieu.

1443
01:10:36,537 --> 01:10:40,041
- Well, would you like to
hear about our European tour?

1444
01:10:40,074 --> 01:10:41,374
- Oh yeah, sure.

1445
01:10:44,277 --> 01:10:47,181
- I can't believe
we're doing this.

1446
01:10:48,716 --> 01:10:50,184
- I love to write.

1447
01:10:51,318 --> 01:10:52,285
- Thank you.

1448
01:10:53,420 --> 01:10:54,822
- Give it to me.

1449
01:10:54,856 --> 01:10:56,190
- I don't know to play this.

1450
01:10:56,224 --> 01:10:57,457
- I can't think
of anything else.

1451
01:10:57,491 --> 01:11:00,595
- I will go first,
do you know why?

1452
01:11:00,628 --> 01:11:01,863
Because I'm good at this,

1453
01:11:01,896 --> 01:11:03,296
and this whole damn
thing is a charade.

1454
01:11:03,330 --> 01:11:07,101
- Oh well, you.

1455
01:11:13,040 --> 01:11:14,474
- We're waiting.

1456
01:11:14,509 --> 01:11:15,810
- I can't see.

1457
01:11:18,713 --> 01:11:19,647
- Me.
- You?

1458
01:11:21,281 --> 01:11:22,449
- Eye.

1459
01:11:25,586 --> 01:11:26,419
- Fall.

1460
01:11:28,089 --> 01:11:28,990
- For you.

1461
01:11:29,023 --> 01:11:31,559
- To pieces.

1462
01:11:34,829 --> 01:11:36,164
- Why are you
congratulating her?

1463
01:11:36,197 --> 01:11:37,598
That was all me.

1464
01:11:37,632 --> 01:11:38,966
- Oh, it
was pretty good.

1465
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:40,400
- Thank you.

1466
01:11:40,433 --> 01:11:42,570
She guessed it because I'm good.

1467
01:11:42,603 --> 01:11:45,940
- I fall because
she literally did.

1468
01:11:45,973 --> 01:11:47,241
- All right, who's next?

1469
01:11:47,275 --> 01:11:48,876
- Not me, the only game
I played for 20 years

1470
01:11:48,910 --> 01:11:51,546
is a board in the cornhole game.

1471
01:12:05,026 --> 01:12:06,459
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1472
01:12:06,493 --> 01:12:09,564
- Cheater, cheater,
cheater, cheater.

1473
01:12:09,597 --> 01:12:11,032
Cheater.

1474
01:12:11,065 --> 01:12:12,900
- She says I don't want
nothing to do with that one.

1475
01:12:12,934 --> 01:12:13,768
- Do it.

1476
01:12:18,906 --> 01:12:21,909
- Is it affair,
illegitimate daughter?

1477
01:12:21,943 --> 01:12:23,511
- Okay.

1478
01:12:23,544 --> 01:12:24,545
- Scam?

1479
01:12:24,579 --> 01:12:25,746
- This is fun.

1480
01:12:26,747 --> 01:12:28,015
- Okay, good,

1481
01:12:28,049 --> 01:12:29,717
we're close already.

1482
01:12:30,718 --> 01:12:31,552
Two words?

1483
01:12:33,988 --> 01:12:34,822
Speak?

1484
01:12:36,090 --> 01:12:37,625
Sing.

1485
01:12:37,658 --> 01:12:39,126
Sing?

1486
01:12:39,160 --> 01:12:40,360
Singing.

1487
01:12:40,393 --> 01:12:41,295
Sing.

1488
01:12:41,329 --> 01:12:42,096
- A song.
- Two?

1489
01:12:42,129 --> 01:12:42,930
- Sick words.

1490
01:12:42,964 --> 01:12:44,098
- Two,

1491
01:12:44,131 --> 01:12:45,299
two syllables?

1492
01:12:45,333 --> 01:12:46,200
One?

1493
01:12:46,234 --> 01:12:47,802
- Syllable?

1494
01:12:47,835 --> 01:12:50,104
Second word one syllable.

1495
01:12:50,137 --> 01:12:51,639
- Forearm.

1496
01:12:51,672 --> 01:12:52,607
- No.

1497
01:12:52,640 --> 01:12:53,875
- First word first syllable!

1498
01:12:55,343 --> 01:12:57,945
- That's not how you
play charades, Chess.

1499
01:13:05,353 --> 01:13:06,187
- Pets?

1500
01:13:07,889 --> 01:13:09,056
- Sounds like.

1501
01:13:10,625 --> 01:13:11,424
- Stab.

1502
01:13:11,458 --> 01:13:12,260
- Stab.

1503
01:13:12,293 --> 01:13:13,094
- Kill.

1504
01:13:13,127 --> 01:13:14,996
Sounds like kill, okay.

1505
01:13:15,029 --> 01:13:16,030
- Bill.

1506
01:13:16,063 --> 01:13:16,998
Bill.

1507
01:13:17,031 --> 01:13:18,232
- Okay.

1508
01:13:18,266 --> 01:13:19,066
- Kill Bill.

1509
01:13:19,100 --> 01:13:20,935
- Kill Bill?

1510
01:13:21,936 --> 01:13:23,403
- Bill is it a word?

1511
01:13:23,436 --> 01:13:24,505
- Second word.

1512
01:13:24,538 --> 01:13:26,473
No, first word, second syllable.

1513
01:13:26,507 --> 01:13:27,440
Okay, bill.

1514
01:13:30,111 --> 01:13:32,412
- Is this a movie
or song or what?

1515
01:13:32,445 --> 01:13:33,347
- Building,

1516
01:13:35,049 --> 01:13:36,617
billable,

1517
01:13:36,651 --> 01:13:37,885
sounds like.

1518
01:13:37,919 --> 01:13:39,220
- I Think we
should do another one.

1519
01:13:39,253 --> 01:13:40,221
- Scan.

1520
01:13:42,857 --> 01:13:43,691
See.

1521
01:13:45,860 --> 01:13:46,661
Bill see,

1522
01:13:46,694 --> 01:13:47,528
Bill,

1523
01:13:48,461 --> 01:13:49,263
Bill,

1524
01:13:49,297 --> 01:13:50,497
Bill Clinton.

1525
01:13:52,099 --> 01:13:52,934
- No.

1526
01:13:54,135 --> 01:13:55,603
- Bill C.

1527
01:13:55,636 --> 01:13:56,469
Bill.

1528
01:13:58,773 --> 01:14:00,041
- Time's up,

1529
01:14:00,074 --> 01:14:01,142
time's up.

1530
01:14:05,513 --> 01:14:06,681
- Quiet.

1531
01:14:06,714 --> 01:14:08,481
- Yes sir, everybody
listen to Kent,

1532
01:14:08,516 --> 01:14:10,151
- I have a box.

1533
01:14:10,184 --> 01:14:11,285
- Wow, very good,

1534
01:14:11,319 --> 01:14:12,219
you've got a box.

1535
01:14:12,253 --> 01:14:15,156
- You're very perceptive.

1536
01:14:15,189 --> 01:14:16,691
- You are the one

1537
01:14:16,724 --> 01:14:18,693
'cause I said I have a box.

1538
01:14:18,726 --> 01:14:19,560
This box

1539
01:14:20,795 --> 01:14:23,331
was created by Hudson

1540
01:14:23,364 --> 01:14:26,300
with lots of different
things for each one of you.

1541
01:14:26,334 --> 01:14:27,568
I do hope you enjoy it.

1542
01:14:27,601 --> 01:14:29,303
Take your time to
have a look through,

1543
01:14:29,337 --> 01:14:31,138
there's something in
there for everybody,

1544
01:14:31,172 --> 01:14:32,606
and if you need anything,

1545
01:14:32,640 --> 01:14:35,776
I'm sure, you'll be
willing to call me.

1546
01:14:35,810 --> 01:14:37,178
Won't you, Daggett?

1547
01:14:37,211 --> 01:14:39,914
Well, you have a
lovely smile, Gwen.

1548
01:14:39,947 --> 01:14:40,848
- Thank you.

1549
01:14:40,881 --> 01:14:41,782
- Thank you very much,

1550
01:14:41,816 --> 01:14:44,185
and as always if you need me,

1551
01:14:44,218 --> 01:14:45,619
don't forget, you
know, I'm right here,

1552
01:14:45,653 --> 01:14:47,989
so you can call me at any time.

1553
01:14:48,022 --> 01:14:48,823
- Or not.

1554
01:14:48,856 --> 01:14:49,657
- Yeah.

1555
01:14:49,690 --> 01:14:50,490
- Thanks again.

1556
01:14:50,524 --> 01:14:52,693
- You all look so happy.

1557
01:14:52,727 --> 01:14:55,830
- Is there a
rattlesnake in there?

1558
01:14:55,863 --> 01:14:58,065
- This guy.

1559
01:14:58,099 --> 01:14:59,900
- Do you wanna finish the game?

1560
01:14:59,934 --> 01:15:01,102
- All right, let's do this.

1561
01:15:01,135 --> 01:15:02,770
- I think it's over.

1562
01:15:06,273 --> 01:15:09,443
- Oh, look.
- Do you remember anything?

1563
01:15:10,778 --> 01:15:13,781
- That belonged to
Lady Nightingale.

1564
01:15:17,151 --> 01:15:18,352
- I don't remember wearing that.

1565
01:15:18,386 --> 01:15:19,687
- You don't remember?

1566
01:15:19,720 --> 01:15:20,654
- I do remember,

1567
01:15:20,688 --> 01:15:22,490
these scarves were my mom's.

1568
01:15:22,523 --> 01:15:23,758
- I remember this.

1569
01:15:23,791 --> 01:15:25,026
- Just because
you didn't wear that,

1570
01:15:25,059 --> 01:15:27,228
they put me in that
because it was blue.

1571
01:15:27,261 --> 01:15:29,263
- Oh, to match your eyes.

1572
01:15:29,296 --> 01:15:30,731
- Sorry.

1573
01:15:30,765 --> 01:15:33,367
- My eyes aren't blue
Aunt Lola, but thank you.

1574
01:15:33,401 --> 01:15:35,503
- Oh, my goodness.

1575
01:15:38,839 --> 01:15:39,673
A medal.

1576
01:15:41,108 --> 01:15:43,644
- That's good question.

1577
01:15:43,677 --> 01:15:45,646
- Was he in the army?

1578
01:15:45,679 --> 01:15:46,881
Not in the army.

1579
01:15:46,914 --> 01:15:48,249
- Was dad in the
army or something?

1580
01:15:48,282 --> 01:15:50,051
- No, never a soldier.

1581
01:15:50,084 --> 01:15:50,985
- For what?

1582
01:15:51,018 --> 01:15:52,319
- You could always do that.

1583
01:15:52,353 --> 01:15:53,921
- For what?

1584
01:15:53,954 --> 01:15:56,557
- Hudson's service medal.

1585
01:15:56,590 --> 01:15:58,993
- Well, isn't anybody
gonna remember,

1586
01:15:59,026 --> 01:16:00,694
that I knit that,

1587
01:16:00,728 --> 01:16:02,029
I knitted that,

1588
01:16:02,063 --> 01:16:03,330
I knitted that,

1589
01:16:04,398 --> 01:16:05,766
knitted that.

1590
01:16:11,272 --> 01:16:12,273
- I'm sorry.

1591
01:16:14,108 --> 01:16:15,976
- I made that one too.

1592
01:16:16,944 --> 01:16:18,312
- Definitely mine.

1593
01:16:21,315 --> 01:16:22,149
Adorable.

1594
01:16:23,918 --> 01:16:24,819
I don't think it would fit now.

1595
01:16:24,852 --> 01:16:26,253
- You should keep that one too.

1596
01:16:26,287 --> 01:16:27,421
- That was yours.
- I'm sure you will.

1597
01:16:27,455 --> 01:16:28,255
- Oh yes, I will.

1598
01:16:28,289 --> 01:16:29,957
- This is really nice.

1599
01:16:29,990 --> 01:16:31,792
- Thank you.

1600
01:16:31,826 --> 01:16:33,027
- There a bunch of the postcards

1601
01:16:33,060 --> 01:16:35,129
Hudson would send
when he would leave

1602
01:16:35,162 --> 01:16:39,166
and not come back for
weeks and weeks and weeks.

1603
01:16:40,201 --> 01:16:42,403
- Look at this one.

1604
01:16:42,436 --> 01:16:43,270
Clay?

1605
01:16:44,238 --> 01:16:45,339
- Oh.

1606
01:16:45,372 --> 01:16:46,207
Oh,

1607
01:16:47,041 --> 01:16:48,409
that is precious.

1608
01:16:48,442 --> 01:16:49,477
- Oh, come on, that is cute.

1609
01:16:49,511 --> 01:16:51,445
- That's Chess and Clay.

1610
01:16:51,479 --> 01:16:52,746
- We were cute.

1611
01:16:54,215 --> 01:16:55,683
- It's a cute picture.

1612
01:16:55,716 --> 01:16:58,486
- I loved
my little brother.

1613
01:16:58,520 --> 01:16:59,987
- And you still do.

1614
01:17:00,020 --> 01:17:00,888
- And I still do.

1615
01:17:00,921 --> 01:17:02,790
- What about JR?

1616
01:17:04,158 --> 01:17:05,726
- I think you
loved him enough Aunt Lola.

1617
01:17:05,759 --> 01:17:06,927
- I loved JR too,

1618
01:17:06,961 --> 01:17:09,697
but JR wasn't in the picture.

1619
01:17:09,730 --> 01:17:11,332
- I wasn't born yet.

1620
01:17:11,365 --> 01:17:12,166
- You weren't born yet.

1621
01:17:12,199 --> 01:17:13,100
- I couldn't.

1622
01:17:13,134 --> 01:17:13,901
- Do you remember how often.

1623
01:17:13,934 --> 01:17:15,537
- You weren't born yet.

1624
01:17:15,570 --> 01:17:16,704
- Do you remember how often dad

1625
01:17:16,737 --> 01:17:19,039
wore this horrible,
terrible tie.

1626
01:17:19,073 --> 01:17:20,007
- He did and he wants to.

1627
01:17:20,040 --> 01:17:20,975
- And that's mom.

1628
01:17:21,008 --> 01:17:22,511
- Is it you or mom?

1629
01:17:22,544 --> 01:17:24,211
- This was his day of
leaving business trip, tie.

1630
01:17:24,245 --> 01:17:25,312
- I think
it's your mother,

1631
01:17:25,346 --> 01:17:26,847
they didn't take much of me.

1632
01:17:26,881 --> 01:17:28,215
- Oh my gosh,

1633
01:17:28,249 --> 01:17:30,417
you do cute little.

1634
01:17:30,451 --> 01:17:31,719
Oh my goodness,

1635
01:17:33,087 --> 01:17:34,623
that's adorable.

1636
01:17:34,655 --> 01:17:35,823
- Camille.

1637
01:17:35,856 --> 01:17:38,092
- No writing on
the back naturally.

1638
01:17:38,125 --> 01:17:40,261
They'd never put the year
on the back of the pictures,

1639
01:17:40,294 --> 01:17:41,362
what's up with that?

1640
01:17:41,395 --> 01:17:42,296
- Why would he do this?

1641
01:17:42,329 --> 01:17:43,230
- I did not make that one,

1642
01:17:43,264 --> 01:17:45,099
I did not make.

1643
01:17:45,132 --> 01:17:46,500
- These stripes
are not flattering.

1644
01:17:46,535 --> 01:17:47,569
- That's Chess.

1645
01:17:47,602 --> 01:17:49,370
- She's beautiful.

1646
01:17:49,403 --> 01:17:51,640
- Why would he put
all this together?

1647
01:17:51,672 --> 01:17:55,676
It's almost like he
finally feels regret?

1648
01:17:55,709 --> 01:17:58,679
- That I don't have a clue.

1649
01:17:58,712 --> 01:18:00,114
- I can't pretend.

1650
01:18:00,147 --> 01:18:00,781
- Good thing I
don't have my glasses on,

1651
01:18:00,814 --> 01:18:02,016
I can't see.

1652
01:18:02,049 --> 01:18:03,518
- He loved
you all, he did.

1653
01:18:03,552 --> 01:18:04,952
- These are really
beautiful pictures though.

1654
01:18:04,985 --> 01:18:09,290
- He was just
too busy making money.

1655
01:18:09,323 --> 01:18:11,025
- Yeah, Aunt Lola
you say that a lot,

1656
01:18:11,058 --> 01:18:13,227
but you don't really,

1657
01:18:13,260 --> 01:18:15,329
explain how that could be.

1658
01:18:15,362 --> 01:18:18,432
- Do you see any pictures
of yourself in here?

1659
01:18:18,465 --> 01:18:20,801
Oh, these are are yours Clay.

1660
01:18:20,834 --> 01:18:21,735
- Christmas time.

1661
01:18:23,404 --> 01:18:25,607
- Those are cute.

1662
01:18:25,640 --> 01:18:26,774
There's gotta be a picture.

1663
01:18:26,807 --> 01:18:29,476
- Yes, the beginning of his,

1664
01:18:29,511 --> 01:18:31,513
belief in me as a clown.

1665
01:18:33,747 --> 01:18:35,316
- Kind of started early.

1666
01:18:35,349 --> 01:18:37,484
- Oh, I think you get this.

1667
01:18:37,519 --> 01:18:39,019
You made this one.

1668
01:18:40,821 --> 01:18:43,692
- Yeah, I used to like
doing pottery and ceramics.

1669
01:18:43,724 --> 01:18:45,025
- Ever the artist.

1670
01:18:45,059 --> 01:18:46,760
- Yeah, when I
was really little.

1671
01:18:46,794 --> 01:18:47,696
- Wow.

1672
01:18:47,728 --> 01:18:48,929
- You remember this?

1673
01:18:48,963 --> 01:18:51,198
Dad gave you that when
you started smoking.

1674
01:18:51,232 --> 01:18:52,634
- Oh, JR,

1675
01:18:52,667 --> 01:18:54,335
here's your patrol badge.

1676
01:18:54,368 --> 01:18:57,338
Do you remember what you
did with the second patrol?

1677
01:18:57,371 --> 01:18:58,472
- Yeah, I do.

1678
01:18:58,506 --> 01:18:59,641
- Yeah, I remember,

1679
01:18:59,674 --> 01:19:01,041
he stole kids lunch money.

1680
01:19:01,075 --> 01:19:02,876
- What can I say?

1681
01:19:02,910 --> 01:19:06,648
- We found him extorting
money from the kids.

1682
01:19:07,549 --> 01:19:09,517
- 25 cents to across the street.

1683
01:19:09,551 --> 01:19:12,052
- To sit on a certain bus seat,

1684
01:19:12,086 --> 01:19:14,054
they wanted to sit on a school
bus seat with a cute girl.

1685
01:19:14,088 --> 01:19:17,758
- Oh, that's JR he was
always resourceful.

1686
01:19:17,791 --> 01:19:19,093
- Yeah, that definitely.

1687
01:19:19,126 --> 01:19:21,996
- This one
was a natural born.

1688
01:19:22,029 --> 01:19:23,364
- Aunt Lola,
why are you waiting

1689
01:19:23,397 --> 01:19:25,099
to tell all this information?

1690
01:19:25,132 --> 01:19:26,601
- Not completely.

1691
01:19:26,635 --> 01:19:28,969
- But you waited to tell all
this information about him

1692
01:19:29,003 --> 01:19:30,838
when he couldn't defend himself.

1693
01:19:30,871 --> 01:19:32,172
- Yep, that was him.

1694
01:19:32,206 --> 01:19:33,340
- More problems
than you know about.

1695
01:19:33,374 --> 01:19:35,876
- I'll go take care of Chess.

1696
01:19:35,909 --> 01:19:37,211
- Let's go Clay.

1697
01:19:37,244 --> 01:19:38,747
You two stay here.

1698
01:19:43,183 --> 01:19:44,451
- Chess?

1699
01:19:44,485 --> 01:19:45,654
Chess darling.

1700
01:19:46,655 --> 01:19:48,155
Oh, what are you doing?

1701
01:19:48,188 --> 01:19:50,858
You're not going anywhere.

1702
01:19:50,891 --> 01:19:51,726
Chess,

1703
01:19:52,860 --> 01:19:54,028
what happened?

1704
01:19:55,530 --> 01:19:57,031
- It hasn't happened
in a long time,

1705
01:19:57,064 --> 01:19:59,333
and since Camilla was born.

1706
01:20:00,735 --> 01:20:02,604
Come and sit by me
sweetheart, like you used to.

1707
01:20:02,637 --> 01:20:04,171
- I can't sit down.

1708
01:20:04,204 --> 01:20:07,441
Now I thought I could do this.

1709
01:20:07,474 --> 01:20:08,809
Well, I thought,

1710
01:20:10,210 --> 01:20:14,716
I just wanted Hudson to look
at me in the eye one more time.

1711
01:20:16,150 --> 01:20:17,351
He never looked at me in
the eye after that night,

1712
01:20:17,384 --> 01:20:19,186
he never looked me in
the eye ever again,

1713
01:20:19,219 --> 01:20:20,988
because I was broken.

1714
01:20:24,058 --> 01:20:25,426
You were my only ally,

1715
01:20:25,459 --> 01:20:27,796
my only ally and you left me,

1716
01:20:27,828 --> 01:20:29,396
you left me alone,

1717
01:20:29,430 --> 01:20:30,898
and I had no one,

1718
01:20:30,931 --> 01:20:31,999
I had no one.

1719
01:20:33,300 --> 01:20:34,902
- I had to baby,

1720
01:20:34,935 --> 01:20:36,337
I had to go.

1721
01:20:36,370 --> 01:20:38,205
- I waited that
night in this bed,

1722
01:20:38,238 --> 01:20:40,140
all I wanted was
Hudson to come in here

1723
01:20:40,174 --> 01:20:41,576
and put his arms
around me and tell me

1724
01:20:41,609 --> 01:20:44,211
I was still his little
girl and he never came.

1725
01:20:44,244 --> 01:20:45,412
- I had to go,

1726
01:20:45,446 --> 01:20:47,014
I had to go.

1727
01:20:47,047 --> 01:20:48,482
After what happened,

1728
01:20:48,516 --> 01:20:51,653
after what happened
at the stadium.

1729
01:20:51,686 --> 01:20:54,388
You saw the cheering picture
down there, didn't you?

1730
01:20:54,421 --> 01:20:56,023
Is that what reminded you of it?

1731
01:20:56,056 --> 01:20:56,857
- Yes,

1732
01:20:58,125 --> 01:20:59,527
it doesn't matter.

1733
01:20:59,561 --> 01:21:00,861
God I was there,

1734
01:21:00,894 --> 01:21:03,230
God I can could
see his fat feet,

1735
01:21:03,263 --> 01:21:05,933
and I could smell his breath,
he'd been drinking beer,

1736
01:21:05,966 --> 01:21:08,469
and he couldn't hold me tight.

1737
01:21:12,306 --> 01:21:15,175
I just wanted him
to leave Clay alone,

1738
01:21:15,209 --> 01:21:16,877
I wanted him to
leave him Clay alone.

1739
01:21:16,910 --> 01:21:17,746
Why?

1740
01:21:22,082 --> 01:21:23,350
- Chess.

1741
01:21:24,485 --> 01:21:25,319
- Chess?

1742
01:21:26,688 --> 01:21:27,522
Chess.

1743
01:21:32,761 --> 01:21:35,028
I heard you, I have
to tell you something.

1744
01:21:35,062 --> 01:21:36,263
- I'm sorry.

1745
01:21:36,296 --> 01:21:39,466
- No, I'm sorry, you
have to listen to me.

1746
01:21:43,904 --> 01:21:45,072
I was secretly

1747
01:21:47,776 --> 01:21:50,244
dating William, Gil's brother,

1748
01:21:52,012 --> 01:21:54,649
and didn't want to be found out,

1749
01:21:57,351 --> 01:22:00,320
and I asked him not
to say anything,

1750
01:22:01,422 --> 01:22:03,792
and I asked to cover this up,

1751
01:22:04,958 --> 01:22:06,360
and Hudson wanted
to cover it up,

1752
01:22:06,393 --> 01:22:07,461
he wanted it to go away,

1753
01:22:07,494 --> 01:22:08,996
that's why they fought,

1754
01:22:09,029 --> 01:22:11,533
and that's why she left,

1755
01:22:11,566 --> 01:22:14,101
because Hudson wanted to
suppress the whole thing,

1756
01:22:14,134 --> 01:22:16,538
and as soon as Gil
killed himself.

1757
01:22:16,571 --> 01:22:17,471
- God it was you.

1758
01:22:17,504 --> 01:22:18,506
- Everybody stopped.

1759
01:22:18,540 --> 01:22:19,774
No, no.

1760
01:22:19,808 --> 01:22:22,142
- It was you
that was scaring us?

1761
01:22:22,176 --> 01:22:25,245
Do you know what it's been like?

1762
01:22:25,279 --> 01:22:28,048
- I didn't have anyone
to help me anymore.

1763
01:22:28,081 --> 01:22:31,218
- I had to keep it all inside,
but I was here for you.

1764
01:22:31,251 --> 01:22:32,419
- I know, but you didn't.

1765
01:22:32,453 --> 01:22:33,353
- But what?

1766
01:22:34,455 --> 01:22:36,256
- Everyone was against me.

1767
01:22:36,290 --> 01:22:38,860
No one was on my side.

1768
01:22:38,893 --> 01:22:40,160
- Everybody was against me,

1769
01:22:40,194 --> 01:22:41,495
they all went at me.

1770
01:22:41,529 --> 01:22:42,664
- Do you know what
would've happened

1771
01:22:42,697 --> 01:22:44,766
if they had found out then?

1772
01:22:44,799 --> 01:22:47,167
They would've beat
me up every day.

1773
01:22:47,201 --> 01:22:48,570
They would've killed me.

1774
01:22:48,603 --> 01:22:52,372
- So do y'all know anything
about these things?

1775
01:22:53,474 --> 01:22:54,709
- I don't know.

1776
01:22:56,176 --> 01:22:59,346
- It's just this photo of my
mom when she was cheering,

1777
01:22:59,379 --> 01:23:01,148
that really upset her,

1778
01:23:01,181 --> 01:23:03,116
like this had to set her off,

1779
01:23:03,150 --> 01:23:06,153
but she looks pretty happy
in this photo, right?

1780
01:23:06,186 --> 01:23:07,956
- Sorry to interrupt.

1781
01:23:10,925 --> 01:23:11,759
You,

1782
01:23:12,694 --> 01:23:14,461
I just wanna tell you that

1783
01:23:14,495 --> 01:23:19,066
Mister Graham's condition
is declining rapidly.

1784
01:23:19,099 --> 01:23:21,936
I've been in touch
with his doctor,

1785
01:23:21,970 --> 01:23:26,741
but I will find you when
there's anything more to report.

1786
01:23:27,775 --> 01:23:28,610
I'm sorry.

1787
01:23:37,585 --> 01:23:41,188
- Well, while
he tells your parents,

1788
01:23:42,757 --> 01:23:46,594
do y'all wanna show me
around the house maybe?

1789
01:23:47,729 --> 01:23:51,131
- I actually, I just
need a snack right now.

1790
01:23:53,535 --> 01:23:54,368
Gosh.

1791
01:23:56,136 --> 01:23:57,572
- I was so frightened.

1792
01:23:57,605 --> 01:24:00,040
- Everybody blamed
me, Hudson blamed me.

1793
01:24:00,073 --> 01:24:01,475
- It wasn't your fault.

1794
01:24:01,509 --> 01:24:03,443
- No, you're damn right,
it wasn't my fault.

1795
01:24:03,477 --> 01:24:04,378
- Nobody blamed you,

1796
01:24:04,411 --> 01:24:05,780
we just wanted it to go away.

1797
01:24:05,813 --> 01:24:08,550
- I was blamed
because Gil raped me.

1798
01:24:08,583 --> 01:24:12,954
I was raped because he was a
rapist, and no other reason,

1799
01:24:12,987 --> 01:24:14,187
and just once it
would've been nice

1800
01:24:14,221 --> 01:24:16,290
if someone could
have told me that.

1801
01:24:16,323 --> 01:24:19,226
- Well, I took care of
it the best that I could.

1802
01:24:19,259 --> 01:24:22,095
I took care of the
son of a bitch.

1803
01:24:23,330 --> 01:24:24,766
- You killed Gil?

1804
01:24:24,799 --> 01:24:27,635
- I spiked his cocaine
with a little something.

1805
01:24:27,669 --> 01:24:28,502
- Why?

1806
01:24:29,469 --> 01:24:30,638
- Because nobody else was gonna

1807
01:24:30,672 --> 01:24:31,438
do anything about it.
- Do you know what

1808
01:24:31,471 --> 01:24:32,707
you took away from me?

1809
01:24:32,740 --> 01:24:33,942
- Well, those two
football players,

1810
01:24:33,975 --> 01:24:35,677
they were going to say
that it was consensual.

1811
01:24:35,710 --> 01:24:39,079
He would've gotten away
with it scot free in court.

1812
01:24:39,112 --> 01:24:40,347
I wasn't gonna stand for that.

1813
01:24:40,380 --> 01:24:43,017
Nobody else was doing
a damn thing about it.

1814
01:24:43,051 --> 01:24:45,820
- I wanted to face him in court.

1815
01:24:45,853 --> 01:24:48,923
I wanted to point to
him and say he raped me.

1816
01:24:48,957 --> 01:24:50,090
You took that away from me.

1817
01:24:50,123 --> 01:24:53,995
- Wasn't it better
just to let it go away?

1818
01:24:54,028 --> 01:24:56,196
- I just was pissed off too,

1819
01:24:56,229 --> 01:24:58,066
and I wanted him dead.

1820
01:24:59,499 --> 01:25:02,369
I mean, you were the only
friend I had back then.

1821
01:25:02,402 --> 01:25:03,605
I'm sorry.

1822
01:25:03,638 --> 01:25:05,105
- Chess you were
always so strong,

1823
01:25:05,138 --> 01:25:07,575
we just thought if he
just died and went away,

1824
01:25:07,609 --> 01:25:08,843
it would die.

1825
01:25:08,876 --> 01:25:10,678
- No, no, no children,

1826
01:25:10,712 --> 01:25:12,880
remember when we
said our prayers,

1827
01:25:12,914 --> 01:25:14,882
we had to get justice for Chess.

1828
01:25:14,916 --> 01:25:16,249
- Lola be quiet.

1829
01:25:18,519 --> 01:25:21,288
God has nothing to do with this.

1830
01:25:21,321 --> 01:25:23,524
What kind of God
would let me be raped?

1831
01:25:23,558 --> 01:25:25,059
I'm sorry, but no.

1832
01:25:26,961 --> 01:25:28,062
- He cried,

1833
01:25:28,096 --> 01:25:28,863
he cried with you.
- I don't,

1834
01:25:28,896 --> 01:25:30,999
he does know I cried.

1835
01:25:31,032 --> 01:25:33,034
- Yes, he does, he does.

1836
01:25:35,268 --> 01:25:37,504
- How could you just let
me carry this burden?

1837
01:25:37,538 --> 01:25:39,473
- I carried burdens
my whole life,

1838
01:25:39,507 --> 01:25:42,209
I suppressed things
my whole life.

1839
01:25:42,242 --> 01:25:44,112
That was my way of coping,

1840
01:25:44,144 --> 01:25:45,713
that was my defense mechanism,

1841
01:25:45,747 --> 01:25:47,682
and when Gil died,

1842
01:25:47,715 --> 01:25:50,551
although I had no idea you
had anything to do with it,

1843
01:25:50,585 --> 01:25:52,787
I thought it could all die,

1844
01:25:52,820 --> 01:25:54,889
and then we could move
on and we could find

1845
01:25:54,922 --> 01:25:56,289
our way again.
- You cannot

1846
01:25:56,323 --> 01:25:57,825
forget about rape.

1847
01:25:58,826 --> 01:26:01,663
It is inside of your body.

1848
01:26:01,696 --> 01:26:04,866
- When we first got
here I asked my mom,

1849
01:26:04,899 --> 01:26:06,500
why did you wanna
leave this place?

1850
01:26:06,534 --> 01:26:08,636
But, the longer I'm here,

1851
01:26:08,670 --> 01:26:10,237
the more draining it is

1852
01:26:10,270 --> 01:26:14,609
and nothing good has happened
since we've been here.

1853
01:26:14,642 --> 01:26:16,176
- I know, I know.

1854
01:26:16,209 --> 01:26:18,713
Every day it's like I came
here to support my dad,

1855
01:26:18,746 --> 01:26:21,248
I came here to be,
you know, be with you,

1856
01:26:21,281 --> 01:26:24,418
and you know, hopefully
to like tell them,

1857
01:26:24,451 --> 01:26:26,688
that we're gonna get married.

1858
01:26:26,721 --> 01:26:27,822
- Yeah, same.

1859
01:26:27,855 --> 01:26:29,524
I mean, when I first got here,

1860
01:26:29,557 --> 01:26:32,860
the first question I
asked was, who all's here?

1861
01:26:32,894 --> 01:26:34,662
But it's like, isn't
this the best time

1862
01:26:34,696 --> 01:26:37,065
when everyone is just
breaking news and fighting.

1863
01:26:37,098 --> 01:26:39,167
- Wait a minute.

1864
01:26:39,199 --> 01:26:40,101
- What?

1865
01:26:40,134 --> 01:26:41,636
- You need to tell your parents.

1866
01:26:41,669 --> 01:26:43,104
- What?

1867
01:26:43,137 --> 01:26:44,806
- If you're not gonna tell
your parents that you're gonna

1868
01:26:44,839 --> 01:26:45,873
get married.
- Hold on, hold on.

1869
01:26:45,907 --> 01:26:47,775
- I'm gonna tell your parents.

1870
01:26:47,809 --> 01:26:48,843
- You just,

1871
01:26:48,876 --> 01:26:49,811
were you listening?

1872
01:26:49,844 --> 01:26:51,713
- Yes, I heard it.

1873
01:26:51,746 --> 01:26:54,716
I heard everything
you two just said.

1874
01:26:54,749 --> 01:26:56,216
- We wanna tell them that,

1875
01:26:56,249 --> 01:26:59,020
that is not your place or your
business to tell them that,

1876
01:26:59,053 --> 01:27:00,555
we want to tell them that,

1877
01:27:00,588 --> 01:27:02,824
so please stay out this.
- You need to tell them,

1878
01:27:02,857 --> 01:27:04,058
You need to tell them.
- Act like you know nothing.

1879
01:27:04,092 --> 01:27:05,492
- There's too many secrets

1880
01:27:05,526 --> 01:27:06,293
going on around here.
- This is not your business.

1881
01:27:06,326 --> 01:27:07,095
- All right, all right,

1882
01:27:07,128 --> 01:27:08,663
okay guys, ladies,

1883
01:27:08,696 --> 01:27:11,632
ladies, we're not
doing this, okay?

1884
01:27:12,800 --> 01:27:15,203
We are going to
tell our parents.

1885
01:27:15,235 --> 01:27:16,503
- No, that's not right.

1886
01:27:16,537 --> 01:27:17,638
- We are going to tell

1887
01:27:17,672 --> 01:27:18,873
our parents.
- That's not right.

1888
01:27:18,906 --> 01:27:19,540
- What are you doing?
- That's not right.

1889
01:27:19,574 --> 01:27:20,775
This is not.

1890
01:27:20,808 --> 01:27:22,877
- No no no, you're
not doing this.

1891
01:27:22,910 --> 01:27:24,377
Stop.

1892
01:27:24,411 --> 01:27:25,213
Stop.

1893
01:27:25,245 --> 01:27:26,047
Stop.

1894
01:27:26,080 --> 01:27:27,280
- Francesca.

1895
01:27:27,314 --> 01:27:29,316
- Who has called me Francesca?

1896
01:27:29,349 --> 01:27:30,785
- Hold on, stop.

1897
01:27:30,818 --> 01:27:35,690
Let me just talk for a damn
minute please, come on.

1898
01:27:35,723 --> 01:27:38,559
- Did you call me Francesca?

1899
01:27:38,593 --> 01:27:39,994
- Give me, give me,

1900
01:27:40,027 --> 01:27:40,862
dad,

1901
01:27:45,166 --> 01:27:46,000
Camilla and I.
- Wait.

1902
01:27:46,033 --> 01:27:47,034
- Stop.

1903
01:27:47,068 --> 01:27:47,869
- Excuse me.

1904
01:27:47,902 --> 01:27:49,103
- Stop.

1905
01:27:49,137 --> 01:27:51,706
Let me just talk
for a damn minute,

1906
01:27:51,739 --> 01:27:53,040
please.

1907
01:27:53,074 --> 01:27:53,975
- This is all your fault.

1908
01:27:54,008 --> 01:27:55,475
- Go ahead son, go ahead.

1909
01:27:55,510 --> 01:27:56,577
- What is it?

1910
01:27:58,246 --> 01:28:00,413
- We're getting married.

1911
01:28:00,447 --> 01:28:03,350
- Camilla and I are
getting married.

1912
01:28:03,383 --> 01:28:04,886
- I'm sorry, what?

1913
01:28:06,254 --> 01:28:08,288
- We're getting married.

1914
01:28:08,321 --> 01:28:12,325
- I think that's great.
- Haven't you seen this?

1915
01:28:12,359 --> 01:28:14,095
- I think that's great.

1916
01:28:14,128 --> 01:28:15,029
- And I'm also expecting.

1917
01:28:15,062 --> 01:28:16,564
- I didn't expect that.

1918
01:28:16,597 --> 01:28:17,598
- Wow, okay.

1919
01:28:18,566 --> 01:28:19,399
Come here.

1920
01:28:20,367 --> 01:28:22,103
- I didn't expect that at all.

1921
01:28:22,136 --> 01:28:23,037
- All right.

1922
01:28:23,070 --> 01:28:23,971
- It's not like not weird.

1923
01:28:24,939 --> 01:28:26,774
- Excuse me, everyone, everyone?

1924
01:28:26,808 --> 01:28:27,642
Excuse me.

1925
01:28:28,576 --> 01:28:31,078
Mister Graham's time has come.

1926
01:28:33,346 --> 01:28:37,752
His last wish was that
everyone be at his bedside.

1927
01:28:37,785 --> 01:28:39,220
Please follow me.

1928
01:28:59,439 --> 01:29:02,977
Please just take your
place around the bed.

1929
01:29:15,256 --> 01:29:17,692
His pulse is very, very weak.

1930
01:29:20,995 --> 01:29:23,231
These are his last moments.

1931
01:29:39,513 --> 01:29:40,348
He's gone.

1932
01:30:20,588 --> 01:30:23,691
If you'd like to
say any final words,

1933
01:30:26,394 --> 01:30:28,562
now would be the ideal time.

1934
01:30:28,596 --> 01:30:29,429
- Daddy,

1935
01:30:31,032 --> 01:30:34,702
we're back in the blue
caves together again.

1936
01:30:35,836 --> 01:30:36,837
Go in peace.

1937
01:30:41,609 --> 01:30:45,079
- I'm sorry for all
the pain I caused you.

1938
01:30:46,380 --> 01:30:49,417
- Thank you for the
love, my darling.

1939
01:30:53,087 --> 01:30:55,056
- I wish I had something

1940
01:30:56,424 --> 01:30:57,825
nostalgic to say.

1941
01:31:01,295 --> 01:31:03,264
You were a tortured man.

1942
01:31:04,365 --> 01:31:06,367
I hope you are at peace.

1943
01:31:09,870 --> 01:31:11,539
- Thank you, Hudson.

1944
01:31:25,519 --> 01:31:28,356
- You brought the
family together.

1945
01:31:36,664 --> 01:31:37,965
- Okay.

1946
01:31:37,999 --> 01:31:40,668
