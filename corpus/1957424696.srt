171
00:08:07,971 --> 00:08:11,740
-Well, his name's Amiri.
-Oh, Amiri. Mm. I like that.

172
00:08:11,775 --> 00:08:13,408
-Sounds distinguished.
-Yeah.

173
00:08:13,443 --> 00:08:15,043
When do we get a chance
to meet him?

174
00:08:15,078 --> 00:08:17,279
-Oh, he'll be here tomorrow.
-Tomorrow?

175
00:08:17,314 --> 00:08:18,313
I know I should have
told you sooner.

176
00:08:18,348 --> 00:08:20,282
You think?

177
00:08:20,317 --> 00:08:22,050
Craig, don't you have
something to say?

178
00:08:22,085 --> 00:08:23,718
Yeah, your mother's right.

179
00:08:23,754 --> 00:08:25,153
We definitely need
to meet the guy...

180
00:08:25,189 --> 00:08:27,088
Making your daughter happy.

181
00:08:27,124 --> 00:08:28,924
[Craig chuckles]

182
00:08:28,959 --> 00:08:30,892
[chuckles]

183
00:08:30,928 --> 00:08:32,627
Why are you smiling
like a Cheshire cat?

184
00:08:32,663 --> 00:08:34,162
I'm so happy
that everybody's gonna be able

185
00:08:34,198 --> 00:08:35,664
to meet him this weekend.

186
00:08:35,699 --> 00:08:38,166
Baby girl, about that, I, uh...

187
00:08:38,202 --> 00:08:39,734
You didn't tell her, Pookie?

188
00:08:39,770 --> 00:08:43,305
"Pookie?" Tell me what?

189
00:08:43,340 --> 00:08:47,676
Uh, Jaylin, why don't we take
those bags on the inside, okay?

190
00:08:47,711 --> 00:08:50,812
You gettin' a little comfortable
with them, okay?

191
00:08:50,847 --> 00:08:55,116
-Oh, uh, Merry Christmas, Craig.
-Merry Christmas.

192
00:08:55,152 --> 00:08:58,153
-You guys, let's take a selfie.
-[Craig] Yeah.

193
00:08:58,188 --> 00:09:00,922
-Come on, come close, please.
-Why?

194
00:09:00,958 --> 00:09:02,190
[camera clicks]

195
00:09:02,226 --> 00:09:04,159
[blows whistle]

196
00:09:04,194 --> 00:09:06,027
[laughs] Rise and shine, baby!

197
00:09:06,063 --> 00:09:07,362
It's eight o'clock
in the morning,

198
00:09:07,397 --> 00:09:09,197
and the day is almost over,
honey.

199
00:09:09,233 --> 00:09:11,800
Come on, baby,
we got a lot of work to do.

200
00:09:11,835 --> 00:09:12,934
Brittney!

201
00:09:13,971 --> 00:09:15,036
[blows whistle]

202
00:09:15,072 --> 00:09:17,138
Brittney.

203
00:09:17,174 --> 00:09:19,040
Come on, baby,
we got a lot of stuff to do.

204
00:09:19,076 --> 00:09:21,776
Mommy's got a full agenda.

205
00:09:21,812 --> 00:09:24,779
[sighs]
Brittney...

206
00:09:26,183 --> 00:09:28,149
Oh, come on, baby, look.

207
00:09:28,185 --> 00:09:31,019
I know how disappointed you are
that your father's not gonna

208
00:09:31,054 --> 00:09:34,956
be here for the holiday, okay?
And trust me.

209
00:09:34,992 --> 00:09:38,860
He would've been here
if he didn't have to work.

210
00:09:38,895 --> 00:09:41,229
I mean, I know takin'
a work trip during Christmas

211
00:09:41,265 --> 00:09:43,832
is not only tacky and messy,

212
00:09:43,867 --> 00:09:45,333
but I think it's disrespectful
and it has no...

213
00:09:45,369 --> 00:09:48,803
Okay, okay, mom.

214
00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:52,040
All right, but, look,
the silver lining is guess what,

215
00:09:52,075 --> 00:09:54,142
you got me!

216
00:09:54,177 --> 00:09:56,144
And do you know
what I was thinking?

217
00:09:56,179 --> 00:09:59,047
I was thinking maybe

218
00:09:59,082 --> 00:10:03,151
we could
put on some matching PJs,

219
00:10:03,186 --> 00:10:06,087
watch some Christmas movies,
huh?

220
00:10:06,123 --> 00:10:09,724
We could get some of that
old-fashioned spiked eggnog.

221
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:12,227
Huh, and we could put in
some real quality time

222
00:10:12,262 --> 00:10:13,828
before Amiri gets here.

223
00:10:13,864 --> 00:10:16,064
-Okay.
-Britty-Brat.

224
00:10:16,099 --> 00:10:17,999
-What time is he comin'?
-[doorbell rings]

225
00:10:18,035 --> 00:10:19,934
[gasping]

226
00:10:19,970 --> 00:10:21,069
-What?
-He's here.

227
00:10:21,104 --> 00:10:24,039
What? Brittney?

228
00:10:24,074 --> 00:10:28,176
[scoffs] You did not tell me
he was coming this early.

229
00:10:28,211 --> 00:10:32,080
Baby! Oh, my God!

230
00:10:32,115 --> 00:10:34,849
I know I wasn't due to get in
until tonight,

231
00:10:34,885 --> 00:10:36,851
but I just missed my baby
so much!

232
00:10:36,887 --> 00:10:38,520
Come, come, come, come!

233
00:10:41,058 --> 00:10:42,957
[door shuts]

234
00:10:42,993 --> 00:10:46,027
-[Tanya clears throat]
-Oh. I'm sorry, mom.

235
00:10:46,063 --> 00:10:48,129
We just...
We missed each other.

236
00:10:48,165 --> 00:10:50,865
You know how that is.
I mean, used to.

237
00:10:50,901 --> 00:10:53,535
I mean, mom, this is Amiri.

238
00:10:55,939 --> 00:10:57,038
Mom?

239
00:10:58,275 --> 00:10:59,941
Mom?

240
00:10:59,976 --> 00:11:01,476
What?

241
00:11:01,511 --> 00:11:06,147
Amiri, this is my mother
Tanya Hamilton.

242
00:11:06,183 --> 00:11:09,117
My champion, my she-ro,

243
00:11:09,152 --> 00:11:13,221
owner of her own
successful hair-care line.

244
00:11:13,256 --> 00:11:16,925
But most importantly,
my best friend.

245
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:20,295
Uh, I thought
I was your best friend.

246
00:11:20,330 --> 00:11:23,131
-Miri!
-[chuckles] I apologize.

247
00:11:23,166 --> 00:11:25,533
It's a pleasure to meet you,
Ms. Hamilton.

248
00:11:28,105 --> 00:11:32,107
Amiri,<i> I</i> am her best friend.

249
00:11:32,142 --> 00:11:35,910
[laughs] I told you.
I told you she's silly.

250
00:11:35,946 --> 00:11:37,912
[laughs] You almost
had me there, Ms. H.

251
00:11:37,948 --> 00:11:41,583
I, you... Why don't I show you
to your room? Come.

252
00:11:45,322 --> 00:11:47,422
Who the hell is Ms. H?

253
00:11:48,191 --> 00:11:49,457
Prince wannabe.

254
00:11:55,716 --> 00:11:59,250
[sighs] Oh, shoot

255
00:11:59,286 --> 00:12:01,252
Oh, there you are.

256
00:12:01,288 --> 00:12:03,955
I thought you got lost
showing Amiri to his room.

257
00:12:03,990 --> 00:12:06,925
Stop, I was just
giving him a tour.

258
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:08,159
Hm.

259
00:12:10,597 --> 00:12:14,466
-You okay?
-Who, me? Oh, pssh, I'm good.

260
00:12:14,501 --> 00:12:16,601
I mean, it's not like
some random stranger

261
00:12:16,636 --> 00:12:18,636
just got sprung on me
during the only time

262
00:12:18,672 --> 00:12:21,706
I get to spend
with my little princess, but...

263
00:12:21,742 --> 00:12:25,076
Oh, wait, that did happen.

264
00:12:25,112 --> 00:12:29,247
I know. I, I could have done
a better job with that.

265
00:12:29,282 --> 00:12:30,548
Yeah, you think?

266
00:12:30,584 --> 00:12:34,486
But just, please play nice.

267
00:12:34,521 --> 00:12:35,987
Look, he really is a great guy.

268
00:12:36,022 --> 00:12:38,323
Okay, Brittney,
I'm sure he is a great guy,

269
00:12:38,358 --> 00:12:41,226
but I don't know anything
about him, okay,

270
00:12:41,261 --> 00:12:44,295
and I don't know what he does, I
don't know what his parents do.

271
00:12:44,331 --> 00:12:46,164
Did you meet him at school,
you meet him in class?

272
00:12:46,199 --> 00:12:48,266
I, I just...
Girl, I am clueless.

273
00:12:48,301 --> 00:12:49,300
I know, I know.

274
00:12:49,336 --> 00:12:51,636
Look, just please...

275
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:55,640
give him a chance, mommy.

276
00:12:58,011 --> 00:13:00,245
I hate when you make that face.

277
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:03,314
-Please?
-Okay.

278
00:13:03,350 --> 00:13:05,183
-One chance. One.
-[squeals]

279
00:13:05,218 --> 00:13:07,285
That's it. Okay?

280
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:10,021
And make sure he tries some
of my product for that hair.

281
00:13:10,056 --> 00:13:12,357
No, seriously,
he needs some shape.

282
00:13:12,392 --> 00:13:16,494
Wow! This spread is amazing.
Ms. H, did you cook all this?

283
00:13:16,530 --> 00:13:20,598
It's Ms. Hamilton. And, no,
actually it was catered.

284
00:13:20,634 --> 00:13:24,636
Well, 'cause it seems like
so much.

285
00:13:24,671 --> 00:13:28,573
-Were you expecting company?
-Nope. No company at all.

286
00:13:30,677 --> 00:13:33,044
It's our tradition.

287
00:13:33,079 --> 00:13:35,380
We have a mommy-daughter feast

288
00:13:35,415 --> 00:13:37,282
the morning
after I come home from school.

289
00:13:37,317 --> 00:13:40,051
-Yup, mommy-daughter.
-Oh...

290
00:13:40,086 --> 00:13:43,621
Well, I hope me being here
isn't too much.

291
00:13:43,657 --> 00:13:47,625
No, not at all. Right, mom?

292
00:13:49,229 --> 00:13:51,296
Oh. No, well, of course not.

293
00:13:51,331 --> 00:13:54,365
Please.
There's plenty of food. Eat.

294
00:13:54,401 --> 00:13:56,301
Psst. Okay.

295
00:14:05,445 --> 00:14:08,680
Oh. That's some
college appetite.

296
00:14:08,715 --> 00:14:11,115
[laughs] Yeah,
minus the college.

297
00:14:12,118 --> 00:14:14,252
I'm sorry, excuse me?

298
00:14:14,287 --> 00:14:16,387
Oh, yeah,
I'm-I'm not in college.

299
00:14:16,423 --> 00:14:19,324
Oh, so you finished early?

300
00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:22,360
No.

301
00:14:22,395 --> 00:14:23,795
[Brittney] Mom...

302
00:14:24,364 --> 00:14:26,397
Mommy...

303
00:14:26,433 --> 00:14:29,500
-Mama?
-What?

304
00:14:29,536 --> 00:14:32,370
Amiri is an amazing artist.

305
00:14:32,405 --> 00:14:34,706
Aww, thanks, babe.

306
00:14:34,741 --> 00:14:36,608
Amiri, look, I'm sorry.

307
00:14:36,643 --> 00:14:39,277
I do not want to come across
as rude, but, honey,

308
00:14:39,312 --> 00:14:43,114
I have heard
literally nothing about you.

309
00:14:43,149 --> 00:14:46,384
Totally understand.
And I must take the blame.

310
00:14:46,419 --> 00:14:49,420
Look, I told Brittney that
I didn't want her to give you

311
00:14:49,456 --> 00:14:51,556
my resume, you know?

312
00:14:51,591 --> 00:14:55,226
I just wanted it to be organic.
Wanted you to feel my energy.

313
00:14:55,262 --> 00:14:58,096
Oh, feel your energy?
Ooh, that's artsy.

314
00:14:58,131 --> 00:15:00,565
Well, can you feel my mine?

315
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:03,101
You know, these strawberries
are really good.

316
00:15:03,136 --> 00:15:06,604
-[door shuts]
-Ah, Jaylin!

317
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:08,806
Yeah. What's the emergency?
I got here as soon as I could.

318
00:15:08,842 --> 00:15:12,543
You are right on time to meet
Brittney's new boyfriend Amiri.

319
00:15:12,579 --> 00:15:15,313
He's an artist.

320
00:15:15,348 --> 00:15:18,650
-That's the emergency?
-Yes.

321
00:15:18,685 --> 00:15:21,052
Ah, nice to meet you, Amiri.

322
00:15:30,196 --> 00:15:32,664
So what type of art do you do?

323
00:15:32,699 --> 00:15:35,233
Well, definitely not the kind
that gets a grade.

324
00:15:35,268 --> 00:15:36,834
-What's that?
-She's trying to make sure...

325
00:15:36,870 --> 00:15:39,404
You're aware
that Amiri's not in college.

326
00:15:39,439 --> 00:15:43,341
Oh. I see.

327
00:15:43,376 --> 00:15:45,343
Well,
college isn't for everybody.

328
00:15:45,378 --> 00:15:47,578
-Uh, exactly.
-[Tanya] Look, I'm sorry.

329
00:15:47,614 --> 00:15:49,514
I gotta disagree, okay?

330
00:15:49,549 --> 00:15:52,350
Education is the key
to opportunity.

331
00:15:52,385 --> 00:15:56,120
Agreed. But who says that school
is the only pathway to wisdom?

332
00:15:56,156 --> 00:15:58,356
You know, I am so sorry,
Lenny Kravitz, okay,

333
00:15:58,391 --> 00:16:00,792
forgive me, I don't know
what the hell I'm talking about.

334
00:16:00,827 --> 00:16:03,261
I'm only
a successful entrepreneur

335
00:16:03,296 --> 00:16:05,697
that has a masters
in both business and marketing.

336
00:16:05,732 --> 00:16:07,632
-So unnecessary.
-Oh, impressive.

337
00:16:07,667 --> 00:16:09,500
I know it is.

338
00:16:09,536 --> 00:16:11,469
These warm exchanges
are really great,

339
00:16:11,504 --> 00:16:14,939
but, Tanya, don't you have
a party to plan for?

340
00:16:14,975 --> 00:16:17,375
-Oh, shoot!
-Mom, that's tonight?

341
00:16:17,410 --> 00:16:20,311
Yes, Brittney,
it is every year the day

342
00:16:20,347 --> 00:16:22,547
after you come home from school

343
00:16:22,582 --> 00:16:25,550
regardless as to
what the weather brings in.

344
00:16:25,585 --> 00:16:27,819
-Should I come?
-You really don't have to.

345
00:16:27,854 --> 00:16:29,721
-Mom!
-[Tanya] What?

346
00:16:29,756 --> 00:16:32,890
Okay, look,
of course he can come, okay?

347
00:16:32,926 --> 00:16:35,893
Well, maybe he should
show his art.

348
00:16:35,929 --> 00:16:37,829
-I don't know.
-Sounds like a good idea.

349
00:16:37,864 --> 00:16:40,164
-I don't know.
-Yeah, no.

350
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:42,500
I mean, we could we be sitting
in front of the next Rembrandt.

351
00:16:42,535 --> 00:16:45,970
-Hm.
-Hm? Hm?

352
00:16:46,006 --> 00:16:47,839
Okay, fine. Fine.

353
00:16:47,874 --> 00:16:50,208
You know what, I will make sure
that he has a spot

354
00:16:50,243 --> 00:16:53,911
so he can display
his little art.

355
00:16:53,947 --> 00:16:57,515
Thank you, Ms. H,
but again, that...

356
00:16:57,550 --> 00:17:01,586
It's Hamilton. Mrs. Hamilton.
Like the musical. Thank you.

357
00:17:01,621 --> 00:17:04,889
-Tanya, can I speak with you?
-Speak.

358
00:17:04,924 --> 00:17:06,457
In the kitchen.

359
00:17:10,230 --> 00:17:11,396
[sighs]

360
00:17:13,033 --> 00:17:16,267
You need to apologize.
I think you insulted him.

361
00:17:16,302 --> 00:17:19,837
Insulted him? Oh, no, no, no,
no, no, he insulted me.

362
00:17:19,873 --> 00:17:23,274
Look, I just offered that nobody
a chance to be somebody

363
00:17:23,309 --> 00:17:25,343
in front of everybody!

364
00:17:25,378 --> 00:17:27,345
And you're supposed to be
on my side.

365
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:28,679
Sides? Why are we taking sides?

366
00:17:28,715 --> 00:17:30,448
Oh, we started taking sides
when I realized

367
00:17:30,483 --> 00:17:32,583
my daughter is dating a loser.

368
00:17:32,619 --> 00:17:33,918
That's a bit harsh,
don't you think?

369
00:17:33,953 --> 00:17:36,320
Oh, he hasn't seen harsh.

370
00:17:39,959 --> 00:17:40,541
You know, I really think
you should share your work.

371
00:17:40,577 --> 00:17:43,978
What? Uh,

372
00:17:44,013 --> 00:17:47,582
What? Uh, it's clear
your mom doesn't respect me.

373
00:17:47,617 --> 00:17:48,983
But that's why you should
show her your work

374
00:17:49,018 --> 00:17:51,018
'cause then she'll see.

375
00:17:51,054 --> 00:17:53,387
No, I'm not trying
to buy her approval.

376
00:17:53,423 --> 00:17:57,058
Approval? Approval for what?

377
00:17:57,093 --> 00:17:59,727
Hm? Approval for what,
Brit-Brat?

378
00:17:59,763 --> 00:18:03,865
Huh, Boo-Boo? what does
Amiri need my approval for?

379
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:06,067
-Well, I...
-No, no, I can, I can speak.

380
00:18:06,102 --> 00:18:09,570
No, you... I don't think
that's a good idea.

381
00:18:09,606 --> 00:18:11,873
Well, I'm sorry, but will
someone please enlighten me

382
00:18:11,908 --> 00:18:14,308
before I politely lose it?

383
00:18:17,447 --> 00:18:18,479
[sighs]

384
00:18:20,083 --> 00:18:24,585
Okay, so the approval...

385
00:18:24,621 --> 00:18:29,056
Well, you know, it's Christmas
and he needs to show his work

386
00:18:29,092 --> 00:18:32,093
because, uh, we're gonna be
leaving for...

387
00:18:32,128 --> 00:18:34,562
Brittney, honey, I'm sorry,
you're not making any sense.

388
00:18:34,597 --> 00:18:37,365
Okay, w-what are you talking
about leave? Spit it out.

389
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:41,536
Well, Amiri
has an upcoming art exhibit

390
00:18:41,571 --> 00:18:45,907
in Basel, Switzerland
over New Year's Eve.

391
00:18:45,942 --> 00:18:49,143
His promo tour starts
for the Art Basel this summer.

392
00:18:49,179 --> 00:18:54,549
Wow. I heard of that,
Basel in Basel.

393
00:18:54,584 --> 00:18:57,351
-Why do you have to leave?
-I want to support him.

394
00:18:59,122 --> 00:19:03,057
And we wanna celebrate,

395
00:19:03,092 --> 00:19:05,126
um, our honeymoon.

396
00:19:05,161 --> 00:19:07,562
[scoffs] What,
a honeymoon to dating?

397
00:19:07,597 --> 00:19:09,497
No, not dating.

398
00:19:09,532 --> 00:19:11,899
Okay, wait, now you two
aren't married, are you?

399
00:19:11,935 --> 00:19:13,634
No, we're not married.

400
00:19:13,670 --> 00:19:16,637
Okay, well, will somebody
please tell me what's going on?

401
00:19:16,673 --> 00:19:20,474
We're-we're getting married
on Christmas.

402
00:19:20,510 --> 00:19:24,111
Wait, you didn't,
you didn't know any of this?

403
00:19:26,950 --> 00:19:29,150
I thought she just didn't know
that we had to leave.

404
00:19:40,697 --> 00:19:42,997
[Tanya chuckles]

405
00:19:44,167 --> 00:19:45,700
[Tanya] Hm..

406
00:19:45,735 --> 00:19:48,669
[Tanya laughing]

407
00:19:54,677 --> 00:19:57,945
You know what?
You got me. Y'all got me!

408
00:19:57,981 --> 00:20:01,849
[laughs] Okay, who was recording
this? Was it you, Jaylin?

409
00:20:01,885 --> 00:20:04,685
Is this one of your
online jokey-jokes?

410
00:20:04,721 --> 00:20:08,522
-I don't think they're joking.
-Oh, they joking, all right.

411
00:20:08,558 --> 00:20:10,958
You best be joking, Brittney.

412
00:20:10,994 --> 00:20:12,693
We're not joking.

413
00:20:15,098 --> 00:20:17,198
You jokin'.

414
00:20:17,233 --> 00:20:21,469
You mean to tell me
that you're gonna marry a guy

415
00:20:21,504 --> 00:20:24,739
that I haven't even met,
doesn't go to college

416
00:20:24,774 --> 00:20:27,141
and I'm assuming that you
haven't met his family either?

417
00:20:28,678 --> 00:20:31,646
Not today, Satan. Not today.

418
00:20:31,681 --> 00:20:34,215
Look, mom, please,
can you just for a second...

419
00:20:36,586 --> 00:20:38,886
-Y'all not getting married.
-But we are.

420
00:20:38,922 --> 00:20:41,188
"But we are."
You know what, that's cute.

421
00:20:41,224 --> 00:20:43,024
That's real cute.

422
00:20:43,059 --> 00:20:45,993
Okay, so who's gonna plan
this Christmas wedding?

423
00:20:46,029 --> 00:20:47,695
In a week at that! Huh?

424
00:20:47,730 --> 00:20:49,664
Well, that's the good news, mom.

425
00:20:49,699 --> 00:20:50,898
You know, we've been planning
for a couple of months.

426
00:20:50,934 --> 00:20:53,734
So it's about done
for the most part.

427
00:20:53,770 --> 00:20:56,704
You've been planning this
for the last couple of months?

428
00:20:58,708 --> 00:20:59,874
Yeah.

429
00:20:59,909 --> 00:21:01,742
How thoughtful of you.

430
00:21:03,947 --> 00:21:05,212
Mom...

431
00:21:07,784 --> 00:21:09,216
[Brittney] Mom...

432
00:21:09,252 --> 00:21:10,051
You know, I just,
I really thought

433
00:21:10,086 --> 00:21:11,819
you'd be relieved.

434
00:21:14,791 --> 00:21:16,757
Look, it's just, I know you've
been really busy with work,

435
00:21:16,793 --> 00:21:19,226
and I didn't want you
distracted.

436
00:21:19,262 --> 00:21:20,895
Look, I just have
a few loose ends.

437
00:21:20,930 --> 00:21:22,697
Oh, you got that right.

438
00:21:22,732 --> 00:21:24,899
No, but we just want something
small, a little party,

439
00:21:24,934 --> 00:21:26,133
nothing too extravagant.

440
00:21:26,169 --> 00:21:27,935
Yeah, nothing
too, too extravagant.

441
00:21:27,971 --> 00:21:30,638
Oh, please! The Hamiltons
don't do anything small.

442
00:21:30,673 --> 00:21:33,607
Everything we do
is a production.

443
00:21:33,643 --> 00:21:35,643
And that's the problem.

444
00:21:35,678 --> 00:21:37,712
A smaller wedding
actually doesn't sound bad.

445
00:21:37,747 --> 00:21:41,549
Jaylin, no, thank you.
No, thank you.

446
00:21:41,584 --> 00:21:43,217
Brittney, let me talk to you
for a minute.

447
00:21:47,290 --> 00:21:50,291
Real talk. Are you pregnant?

448
00:21:50,326 --> 00:21:52,593
-Mom!
-Okay then, follow-up question.

449
00:21:52,628 --> 00:21:54,729
-Are you on drugs?
-Mom! Really?

450
00:21:54,764 --> 00:21:57,331
That is not too far-fetched
to ask, okay?

451
00:21:57,367 --> 00:21:59,233
Who's gonna pay
for this wedding?

452
00:22:00,670 --> 00:22:01,869
Dad is.

453
00:22:03,039 --> 00:22:05,206
So your father knows?

454
00:22:06,009 --> 00:22:07,208
Yeah.

455
00:22:08,044 --> 00:22:09,243
Wow.

456
00:22:10,313 --> 00:22:12,146
-Wow!
-But, mom...

457
00:22:13,649 --> 00:22:15,683
He hasn't met Amiri yet,
you'll be the first!

458
00:22:15,718 --> 00:22:18,319
Oh, okay, but your father
gave you a blessing

459
00:22:18,354 --> 00:22:20,287
for a guy
that he hasn't even met yet

460
00:22:20,323 --> 00:22:21,989
and you couldn't
even introduce me?

461
00:22:22,025 --> 00:22:24,358
Ma, it's not like that.
It's just...

462
00:22:24,394 --> 00:22:28,262
You know, I knew you would react
like this, and dad is just...

463
00:22:28,297 --> 00:22:30,297
-What?
-He's just easier.

464
00:22:31,334 --> 00:22:33,234
Easier to what, Brittney?

465
00:22:34,704 --> 00:22:38,339
-Easier to talk to.
-Oh.

466
00:22:39,909 --> 00:22:42,910
I'm glad you found someone
that you can confide in.

467
00:22:46,716 --> 00:22:50,317
-Mom?
-Brittney, this is a lot.

468
00:22:50,353 --> 00:22:53,220
That's all I'm gonna say
right now, okay?

469
00:22:53,256 --> 00:22:55,256
Let me go talk to your mother.

470
00:22:56,826 --> 00:22:59,126
Oh! Mm-mm!

471
00:22:59,162 --> 00:23:01,195
A Christmas wedding! Mm-mm!

472
00:23:01,230 --> 00:23:03,998
Not on my watch, not today.

473
00:23:04,033 --> 00:23:05,866
-I hear you.
-Mm-mm!

474
00:23:05,902 --> 00:23:08,402
Do you know what, Jaylin? I
really don't think you heard me.

475
00:23:08,438 --> 00:23:09,904
I really don't think you did,
okay?

476
00:23:09,939 --> 00:23:12,239
My daughter is about
to throw her life away

477
00:23:12,275 --> 00:23:15,843
and marry some tagger
that she barely even knows!

478
00:23:15,878 --> 00:23:18,379
-Well, he did get into Basel.
-Basel-schmasel, razzle-dazzle.

479
00:23:18,414 --> 00:23:20,381
I don't give a damn
about his art.

480
00:23:20,416 --> 00:23:22,216
Do you honestly feel like
telling her no

481
00:23:22,251 --> 00:23:25,019
is gonna stop her?
She's just as stubborn as you.

482
00:23:25,054 --> 00:23:27,988
How can you be so calm
about this?

483
00:23:28,024 --> 00:23:31,892
We don't know that guy. We don't
know where he comes from.

484
00:23:31,928 --> 00:23:34,161
He might even be
from the ghetto.

485
00:23:34,197 --> 00:23:35,763
[scoffs] You're from the ghetto.

486
00:23:35,798 --> 00:23:38,732
I was. I was from the ghetto.

487
00:23:38,768 --> 00:23:41,001
Ain't about where you come from,
about where you at.

488
00:23:41,037 --> 00:23:43,070
You trying to control things
is only gonna have her run

489
00:23:43,106 --> 00:23:44,338
further into his arms.

490
00:23:45,308 --> 00:23:46,740
Hm.

491
00:23:48,044 --> 00:23:49,276
So what's your plan?

492
00:23:49,312 --> 00:23:51,378
There is no plan.

493
00:23:51,414 --> 00:23:54,014
-Hey. Hey!
-What?

494
00:23:54,050 --> 00:23:55,916
I know it's tough,

495
00:23:55,952 --> 00:24:00,387
but you've got to trust
the woman you raised.

496
00:24:00,423 --> 00:24:03,424
And if there is a plan,
that's it.

497
00:24:04,227 --> 00:24:05,926
Support her.

498
00:24:05,962 --> 00:24:09,130
Try to get to know
your possible future son-in-law

499
00:24:09,165 --> 00:24:11,332
and help plan this wedding.

500
00:24:12,435 --> 00:24:13,968
[whispers] Okay.

501
00:24:14,003 --> 00:24:15,202
[exhales]

502
00:24:15,238 --> 00:24:17,138
-Okay!
-Okay.

503
00:24:17,173 --> 00:24:19,073
All right.

504
00:24:19,108 --> 00:24:20,941
You're a good friend.

505
00:24:20,977 --> 00:24:23,911
Your BFF, right?

506
00:24:26,349 --> 00:24:28,282
Buddy.

507
00:24:28,317 --> 00:24:30,985
-God, thank you!
-You got it.

508
00:24:31,020 --> 00:24:32,286
[sighs]

509
00:24:34,857 --> 00:24:36,457
Brittney.

510
00:24:40,363 --> 00:24:42,963
My pretty, pretty Brit-Brat.

511
00:24:43,766 --> 00:24:46,300
Aww!

512
00:24:46,335 --> 00:24:49,937
Oh, my little princess, my baby.

513
00:24:49,972 --> 00:24:51,372
[chuckles]

514
00:24:54,043 --> 00:24:55,876
And Walter.

515
00:24:57,180 --> 00:25:01,015
Hm... How you doin'?

516
00:25:01,050 --> 00:25:03,984
[laughing]

517
00:25:08,491 --> 00:25:11,425
[indistinct chatter]

518
00:25:13,963 --> 00:25:16,330
Amiri is definitely a hit.

519
00:25:16,365 --> 00:25:17,865
Did you see his work?
He's pretty talented.

520
00:25:17,900 --> 00:25:20,000
Uh, whatever, I guess.

521
00:25:20,036 --> 00:25:23,370
But I still got my eye on him,
I don't like those artsy types.

522
00:25:23,406 --> 00:25:25,372
-How's that now?
-Freaky deebs.

523
00:25:25,408 --> 00:25:27,541
I'm telling you,
they're like playboys.

524
00:25:27,577 --> 00:25:29,343
He's gonna slip up
and I'mma be right there

525
00:25:29,378 --> 00:25:31,545
and I'mma catch him.
be like, "Bam!"

526
00:25:31,581 --> 00:25:33,380
-Bam, huh?
-Yes, bam.

527
00:25:33,416 --> 00:25:35,316
-[chuckles]
-Bam! Oh, Jesus!

528
00:25:35,351 --> 00:25:38,519
[laughing]

529
00:25:39,989 --> 00:25:42,189
I'm sorry.

530
00:25:42,225 --> 00:25:43,390
What, it's too easy.

531
00:25:43,426 --> 00:25:45,859
You know what, you've been doing
a whole lot of surprising

532
00:25:45,895 --> 00:25:47,194
around here lately.

533
00:25:47,230 --> 00:25:49,496
On that note,
I'mma go refill my drink.

534
00:25:49,532 --> 00:25:52,032
[Tanya] Mm-hmm.
[Jaylin] Sorry.

535
00:25:55,438 --> 00:25:57,905
-I really am sorry, mom.
-Mm.

536
00:25:57,940 --> 00:26:00,074
You didn't deserve that.
It wasn't cool.

537
00:26:00,109 --> 00:26:02,343
No, not at all.

538
00:26:02,378 --> 00:26:03,877
Do you love him?

539
00:26:05,414 --> 00:26:07,815
-I do. [chuckles]
-[sighs]

540
00:26:07,850 --> 00:26:09,516
Look, mom, I know
I'm asking for a lot,

541
00:26:09,552 --> 00:26:13,387
but... just look over there.

542
00:26:13,422 --> 00:26:16,423
When he looks at me,
he makes me feel like

543
00:26:16,459 --> 00:26:18,392
I'm the only woman in the room.

544
00:26:19,395 --> 00:26:20,995
That's 'cause you are savage!

545
00:26:21,030 --> 00:26:23,397
-[laughs]
-What? Mom...

546
00:26:23,432 --> 00:26:25,232
No, I'm just sayin',
Brittney, I wanted us

547
00:26:25,268 --> 00:26:27,401
to spend more time together,
that's all.

548
00:26:27,436 --> 00:26:30,871
I know, mom, and I promise,
we're gonna get our time.

549
00:26:30,906 --> 00:26:32,539
Mm-hmm, and I cannot believe

550
00:26:32,575 --> 00:26:35,409
you planned an entire wedding
without me.

551
00:26:35,444 --> 00:26:38,379
Do you know how long I've been
planning that day for you?

552
00:26:38,414 --> 00:26:40,914
I know, I know, but I just
wanted to keep things simple.

553
00:26:40,950 --> 00:26:44,251
You know? But we still need
a cake and we need a DJ.

554
00:26:44,287 --> 00:26:46,920
Oh, wow, hooray,
I get to be on cake duty

555
00:26:46,956 --> 00:26:49,023
and I get to find
the next DJ Nice. Wow!

556
00:26:49,058 --> 00:26:51,392
Mom, we could use
your pastry chef.

557
00:26:51,427 --> 00:26:53,060
-Chef, um...
-Chef Mindy?

558
00:26:53,095 --> 00:26:55,429
-Yes! Chef Mindy!
-Oh!

559
00:26:55,464 --> 00:26:58,299
What if we got 12 doves
and released them at midnight?

560
00:26:58,334 --> 00:27:00,301
-Twelve o'clock midnight?
-Mom, small.

561
00:27:00,336 --> 00:27:02,569
-Remember?
-Okay.

562
00:27:02,605 --> 00:27:05,105
But I am happy
that we have you onboard.

563
00:27:05,141 --> 00:27:06,907
Oh, well, I'm getting there.

564
00:27:06,942 --> 00:27:09,476
Well, how about
we get you there on the stage

565
00:27:09,512 --> 00:27:11,578
where we can do
our little number?

566
00:27:11,614 --> 00:27:15,249
-And show the peeps.
-What we got. Yeah!

567
00:27:15,284 --> 00:27:16,950
You got it?
Oh, let's do it, girl!

568
00:27:16,986 --> 00:27:18,452
Let's do it! Let's do it!
Let's do it! Let's do it!

569
00:27:20,139 --> 00:27:21,939
[Tanya vocalizing]

570
00:27:21,974 --> 00:27:25,109

a good time, say "Yeah!"

All right, give it up
for my daughter Brittney

00:28:33,379 --> 00:28:34,445
all the way from college!

00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:37,147
[crowd cheering]

598
00:28:41,420 --> 00:28:42,686
[Amiri] Ah!

599
00:28:44,123 --> 00:28:46,123
-Hey!
-[Brittney] Hey, mom.

600
00:28:46,158 --> 00:28:47,724
-[laughs]
-Wanna do some shots with us?

601
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:50,427
Ooh, no. I have not done shots
since college.

602
00:28:50,463 --> 00:28:53,230
But, well, maybe that's not
even a college thing anymore,

603
00:28:53,265 --> 00:28:56,233
right, Amiri?

604
00:28:56,268 --> 00:29:00,104
That performance you guys put on
earlier was really beautiful.

605
00:29:00,139 --> 00:29:01,638
Oh, thank you!

606
00:29:01,674 --> 00:29:04,541
Not you. I'm talking to them.

607
00:29:04,577 --> 00:29:08,212
Weren't you the woman
they tried to take the mic from?

608
00:29:08,247 --> 00:29:09,713
[mumbles]

609
00:29:12,184 --> 00:29:15,919
Ooh, they smell old.
Like, old old.

610
00:29:17,256 --> 00:29:18,622
Is that...

611
00:29:20,459 --> 00:29:24,328
-Amiri, I'll be right back.
-Oh! Hey!

612
00:29:24,363 --> 00:29:27,464
-Is that her ex?
-Mm-hmm.

613
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:29,299
Oh, you dirty little...

614
00:29:29,335 --> 00:29:30,567
I thought you didn't
like surprises

615
00:29:30,603 --> 00:29:32,269
and now you're doing
the same thing.

616
00:29:32,304 --> 00:29:35,239
Look, I said I don't like
receiving surprises.

617
00:29:35,274 --> 00:29:38,408
Now, giving them,
that's a whole other thing.

618
00:29:38,444 --> 00:29:40,611
[indistinct chatter]

619
00:29:40,646 --> 00:29:43,313
-Something looks different.
-Hm.

620
00:29:43,349 --> 00:29:47,084
It's way too many patterns
for one person.

621
00:29:47,119 --> 00:29:50,287
Walt, this is my<i> fiance</i> Amiri.

622
00:29:50,322 --> 00:29:52,489
Amiri, this is Walt.

623
00:29:52,525 --> 00:29:53,690
Hey, it's nice to meet you, bro.

624
00:29:53,726 --> 00:29:56,326
Hey. Hey, Ms. Hamilton.

625
00:29:56,362 --> 00:29:58,162
-Walter.
-[laughter]

626
00:29:58,197 --> 00:30:01,265
You know, Walt, this is
so random seeing you here.

627
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:03,634
Well, yes and no.

628
00:30:03,669 --> 00:30:06,770
-Oops. Oh.
-[Brittney] I see.

629
00:30:06,805 --> 00:30:08,805
[laughs] You know, mom,
I actually ran into Walt

630
00:30:08,841 --> 00:30:11,341
a little bit ago
and we reconnected.

631
00:30:11,377 --> 00:30:14,111
I'm so happy that you're living
in your truth now.

632
00:30:14,146 --> 00:30:14,811
His truth?

633
00:30:14,847 --> 00:30:16,346
It was such a heavy weight off

634
00:30:16,382 --> 00:30:17,814
my shoulders,
but Britt is the best.

635
00:30:17,850 --> 00:30:19,683
I mean,
I thought it would be awkward,

636
00:30:19,718 --> 00:30:21,218
the whole
my-ex-is-now-gay thing.

637
00:30:21,253 --> 00:30:22,486
[laughter]

638
00:30:22,521 --> 00:30:25,289
Thank you, sister.

639
00:30:25,324 --> 00:30:28,058
You know, Walt is actually
a big-time DJ now.

640
00:30:28,093 --> 00:30:30,627
-Oh, stop. But go on.
-[laughter]

641
00:30:30,663 --> 00:30:33,664
Oh, wow, that's so cool, man.

642
00:30:33,699 --> 00:30:35,666
Wait, wait,
would you be interested

643
00:30:35,701 --> 00:30:37,634
in DJ'ing our wedding?

644
00:30:37,670 --> 00:30:39,670
-I would love to.
-[Brittney] It's a good idea.

645
00:30:39,705 --> 00:30:43,540
-Yeah.
-Yo, Ms. H, did you plan this?

646
00:30:43,576 --> 00:30:46,376
Well, that's my mom, you know,
she always has a little trick

647
00:30:46,412 --> 00:30:47,578
up her sleeve.

648
00:30:47,613 --> 00:30:49,313
-[laughs]
-Look at 'em.

649
00:30:49,348 --> 00:30:51,682
[laughter]

650
00:30:51,717 --> 00:30:53,650
Yeah, you like 'em.

651
00:30:54,887 --> 00:30:57,221
-Mm.
-Uh, oh, okay.

652
00:30:57,256 --> 00:30:58,689
-Damn, Walter.
-Slow down.

653
00:31:02,728 --> 00:31:05,162
Oh! Hey, sleepyhead.

654
00:31:05,197 --> 00:31:06,563
You know, the caterers
did an amazing job.

655
00:31:06,599 --> 00:31:08,765
You can't even tell we had
a party here last night.

656
00:31:08,801 --> 00:31:11,568
Oh, the caterers might have done
a great job with cleanin' up,

657
00:31:11,604 --> 00:31:15,072
but my poor head, Whoo,
it is definitely telling me

658
00:31:15,107 --> 00:31:17,574
we had a party,
I guess I had one too many

659
00:31:17,610 --> 00:31:19,743
of those Santa shots.

660
00:31:19,778 --> 00:31:21,378
They got me feeling
like a ho-ho-ho!

661
00:31:21,413 --> 00:31:23,747
[Tanya laughing]

662
00:31:23,782 --> 00:31:27,351
-Uh, you're okay, baby?
-Oh, yeah.

663
00:31:27,386 --> 00:31:29,853
-Where's Amiri?
-Um, I don't know.

664
00:31:29,888 --> 00:31:33,790
-He left earlier this morning.
-Wait, you didn't call him?

665
00:31:33,826 --> 00:31:36,793
No, you know,
he rarely has his phone on.

666
00:31:36,829 --> 00:31:40,364
[squeals] I'm sorry, timeout.

667
00:31:40,399 --> 00:31:43,267
[laughs] Okay, wait, wait, wait,
let me see what you're sayin',

668
00:31:43,302 --> 00:31:45,602
that there are some times
that he doesn't have his phone.

669
00:31:45,638 --> 00:31:48,605
So that means you can't always
get in contact with him?

670
00:31:48,641 --> 00:31:50,774
Mom, he's an artist.

671
00:31:50,809 --> 00:31:51,875
Sometimes he has to fall
off the grid.

672
00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:54,378
-It's not a big deal.
-Okay. Okay.

673
00:31:54,413 --> 00:31:57,314
I'm just saying, it's just
kinda hard to trust a man

674
00:31:57,349 --> 00:31:59,750
when he gives you a reason
not to really.

675
00:31:59,785 --> 00:32:01,618
You just gotta trust your gut.

676
00:32:01,654 --> 00:32:03,553
[grunts] Not this gut.

677
00:32:03,589 --> 00:32:05,489
[laughter]

678
00:32:05,524 --> 00:32:07,724
[Tanya] But if you say so, baby.

679
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:10,294
-Ah.
-Ah, good morning, ladies.

680
00:32:10,329 --> 00:32:13,463
I hope you're hungry.
I brought some treats.

681
00:32:13,499 --> 00:32:19,236
Oh, Ms. Hamilton, I know
we started off a tad bit rocky,

682
00:32:19,271 --> 00:32:22,773
but I wanted to thank you
for your hospitality.

683
00:32:22,808 --> 00:32:26,677
Aw! See, mom, isn't he sweet?

684
00:32:26,712 --> 00:32:29,579
Mm. He's so sweet,
my tooth hurts.

685
00:32:29,615 --> 00:32:33,183
[chuckles]
Wow!

686
00:32:33,218 --> 00:32:35,485
Oh, well, you know,
your grandmother always said

687
00:32:35,521 --> 00:32:39,489
"Be leery of men that are full
of compliments and gifts.

688
00:32:39,525 --> 00:32:42,793
It usually means that
they're full of other stuff."

689
00:32:42,828 --> 00:32:46,863
Well, you know, mema also said
to be slow to judge

690
00:32:46,899 --> 00:32:48,332
and quick to observe.

691
00:32:48,367 --> 00:32:51,335
-Mm.
-Sounds like a wise woman.

692
00:32:51,370 --> 00:32:53,337
-I can't wait to meet her.
-Oh. You'll get to meet her.

693
00:32:53,372 --> 00:32:54,838
On this weekend,
she'll be at the wedding.

694
00:32:54,873 --> 00:32:57,441
I know
she can't wait to meet you.

695
00:32:57,476 --> 00:33:00,310
Okay, look, I'm sorry, Brittney,
wait a minute.

696
00:33:00,346 --> 00:33:02,946
So mema knows,
your father knows.

697
00:33:02,981 --> 00:33:05,349
What, who else knows,
the mailman?

698
00:33:05,384 --> 00:33:08,785
-[whispers] Not right now.
-Okay, I'm sorry. Amiri.

699
00:33:08,821 --> 00:33:10,954
What do your parents think
about this engagement?

700
00:33:10,989 --> 00:33:13,724
Um, well, my mom knows.

701
00:33:13,759 --> 00:33:15,992
And my father passed away
when I was younger.

702
00:33:16,028 --> 00:33:17,728
[Tanya] Oh. I'm sorry, okay?

703
00:33:17,763 --> 00:33:19,830
But what does your mother think
about this entanglement?

704
00:33:19,865 --> 00:33:21,765
[car honking]

705
00:33:23,268 --> 00:33:25,369
Um, she's here early.

706
00:33:25,404 --> 00:33:27,671
-Oh, I forgot she was comin'.
-[Tanya] Who's she?

707
00:33:27,706 --> 00:33:28,705
-Who?
-My mother.

708
00:33:28,741 --> 00:33:30,707
Ah. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

709
00:33:30,743 --> 00:33:32,409
You ain't told me nothing
about his mother.

710
00:33:32,444 --> 00:33:34,411
I know, I forgot.
Come on. Come on.

711
00:33:34,446 --> 00:33:36,480
Brittney!

712
00:33:36,515 --> 00:33:37,814
The house is a mess!

713
00:33:37,850 --> 00:33:40,984
[dramatic music]

714
00:33:57,035 --> 00:33:59,503
Brittney! Are you serious?

715
00:33:59,538 --> 00:34:01,838
This is not only
the second unexpected guest,

716
00:34:01,874 --> 00:34:04,408
but unexpected surprise.
What is going on with you?

717
00:34:04,443 --> 00:34:07,377
I'm sorry, I was just so nervous
about how to tell you

718
00:34:07,413 --> 00:34:09,713
about the wedding, I completely
forgot she was coming.

719
00:34:09,748 --> 00:34:11,681
But, look, I invited her to
stay with us because I figured

720
00:34:11,717 --> 00:34:13,517
you two would hit it off
and we could all bond.

721
00:34:13,552 --> 00:34:15,585
Okay, you know what,
you invited her,

722
00:34:15,621 --> 00:34:18,388
so you're gonna host her.
Get your own agenda.

723
00:34:24,830 --> 00:34:27,798
-Hi, mom.
-Mwah. Hello, baby.

724
00:34:27,833 --> 00:34:30,600
Wilson, can you GPS
the nearest Four Seasons?

725
00:34:30,636 --> 00:34:32,736
That won't be necessary, Wilson,
you can just grab our bags

726
00:34:32,771 --> 00:34:34,070
from the trunk, please. Mom?

727
00:34:34,106 --> 00:34:35,372
-What?
-Please don't start.

728
00:34:35,407 --> 00:34:36,640
I just wasn't sure this cottage

729
00:34:36,675 --> 00:34:37,941
had enough room for me.

730
00:34:37,976 --> 00:34:39,743
There's more than
enough room, mom.

731
00:34:39,778 --> 00:34:42,746
I guess. I just don't see
why you made such a fuss

732
00:34:42,781 --> 00:34:44,314
of me staying here
with your future in-laws,

733
00:34:44,349 --> 00:34:45,982
and for a whole week,
it's absurd.

734
00:34:46,018 --> 00:34:47,984
Our future in-laws, mom.

735
00:34:48,020 --> 00:34:50,554
I just thought we could speed up
the process of getting to know

736
00:34:50,589 --> 00:34:54,424
one another by spending
some extended time.

737
00:34:54,460 --> 00:34:57,394
Hm. Okay.

738
00:34:57,429 --> 00:34:58,929
-What's the deal with the queen?
-I don't know.

739
00:34:58,964 --> 00:35:01,431
I haven't heard much about her,
just that she's travels a lot.

740
00:35:01,467 --> 00:35:04,301
-Oh. For work?
-Oh, no, she doesn't work.

741
00:35:04,336 --> 00:35:06,403
I think she has her own
private jet or something.

742
00:35:06,438 --> 00:35:07,771
Oh, come on, ma,
let's go meet her.

743
00:35:07,806 --> 00:35:08,939
A jet?

744
00:35:12,611 --> 00:35:14,411
-Hi.
-And this is Brittney.

745
00:35:14,446 --> 00:35:17,747
Hi, it's so nice to meet you.

746
00:35:17,783 --> 00:35:19,816
Mom, this is Ms. Hamilton.

747
00:35:19,852 --> 00:35:21,985
Oh, uh, you can call me Tanya.

748
00:35:22,020 --> 00:35:25,589
Nice to meet you, Tanya.
I'm Ms. Lawrence.

749
00:35:25,624 --> 00:35:27,924
[Amiri] Mom.

750
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:30,594
Demetria is fine, I guess.

751
00:35:32,164 --> 00:35:36,366
[sighs] Cute place.
Is it a rental?

752
00:35:36,401 --> 00:35:37,801
[scoffs]

753
00:35:37,836 --> 00:35:40,303
-Uh...
-Okay, okay, okay.

754
00:35:42,541 --> 00:35:43,940
[Tanya sighs]

755
00:35:46,178 --> 00:35:49,479
So, uh, although
we weren't expecting company,

756
00:35:49,515 --> 00:35:52,349
which seems to be
the recurring theme around here,

757
00:35:52,384 --> 00:35:54,084
um, I think
you'll be very comfortable

758
00:35:54,119 --> 00:35:55,785
in our maid's quarters.

759
00:35:55,821 --> 00:35:57,754
-Mom.
-Well...

760
00:35:57,789 --> 00:36:00,156
Brittney, she prefers
to call it the West Wing.

761
00:36:00,192 --> 00:36:02,158
[Tanya and Demetria chuckling]

762
00:36:02,194 --> 00:36:04,828
Well, Tanya, your home,

763
00:36:04,863 --> 00:36:08,131
well, it's, it's very cute.

764
00:36:09,735 --> 00:36:13,169
-Thank you.
-Yes, it's very pleasant.

765
00:36:13,205 --> 00:36:15,539
Is it, um, like a fixer-upper?

766
00:36:15,574 --> 00:36:17,474
Mom, you remember I told you

767
00:36:17,509 --> 00:36:20,544
that Ms. Hamilton
owns her own company.

768
00:36:20,579 --> 00:36:23,013
A very successful line
of hair-care products.

769
00:36:23,048 --> 00:36:25,148
[Demetria] Mm-hmm. Good for you.

770
00:36:25,183 --> 00:36:27,551
This administration
is definitely working

771
00:36:27,586 --> 00:36:31,955
with a lot minorities,
get their businesses started.

772
00:36:31,990 --> 00:36:35,692
You know what, why don't
I show you to your chamber?

773
00:36:35,727 --> 00:36:37,093
Walk this way.

774
00:36:38,830 --> 00:36:42,032
Oh. Here's my wall of fame.

775
00:36:42,067 --> 00:36:44,167
Just a few of my awards.

776
00:36:44,202 --> 00:36:46,870
You know,
God gives the real reward.

777
00:36:55,047 --> 00:36:57,547
-Oh. I'm allergic to dust.
-Mom.

778
00:36:57,583 --> 00:37:00,150
What? Uh, listen,
I don't meant to be mean.

779
00:37:00,185 --> 00:37:03,753
I'm just a big germaphobe.

780
00:37:03,789 --> 00:37:06,923
-Likewise.
-Mom, look at the time.

781
00:37:06,959 --> 00:37:07,724
We've to go to our cake tasting.

782
00:37:07,759 --> 00:37:10,594
Ooh, yes!

783
00:37:10,629 --> 00:37:12,929
Well, it takes about a year
to get an appointment

784
00:37:12,965 --> 00:37:14,230
with Pastry Chef Mindy,

785
00:37:14,266 --> 00:37:16,666
but thank goodness
she's a dear friend of mine.

786
00:37:16,702 --> 00:37:19,235
Oh? Well,
I've never heard of her.

787
00:37:19,271 --> 00:37:21,104
But then again,
I'm not big on sweets.

788
00:37:21,139 --> 00:37:23,173
You gotta stay fit, you know?

789
00:37:25,978 --> 00:37:27,177
Come on, mom.

790
00:37:31,083 --> 00:37:32,549
[Tanya grunts]

791
00:37:34,586 --> 00:37:37,854
You know, mom, I'm really
excited to be doing this.

792
00:37:37,889 --> 00:37:40,023
Ooh, me too,
ooh, you saw those two cakes

793
00:37:40,058 --> 00:37:42,559
that were right in the front,
they look delicious!

794
00:37:42,594 --> 00:37:43,960
They look so dry to me.

795
00:37:43,996 --> 00:37:45,795
About as dry
as their closure.

796
00:37:45,831 --> 00:37:47,464
-Excuse me?
-You heard me.

797
00:37:47,499 --> 00:37:51,635
You know, mom is actually
moving her business

798
00:37:51,670 --> 00:37:53,937
out into Asia, so she's been
studying the culture

799
00:37:53,972 --> 00:37:55,705
for the past few years.

800
00:37:55,741 --> 00:37:57,874
-Oh, nice.
-Thank you.

801
00:37:57,909 --> 00:38:01,945
Where did you say Chef Mindy
is based out of in Korea?

802
00:38:02,814 --> 00:38:05,749
The south side.

803
00:38:05,784 --> 00:38:07,083
[chuckles]

804
00:38:07,119 --> 00:38:10,253
-[gasps] Ah! Chef Mindy!
-Hi!

805
00:38:10,288 --> 00:38:13,657
Oh, thank you so much for taking
time out of your busy schedule

806
00:38:13,692 --> 00:38:16,960
to squeeze us in, you remember
my beautiful daughter

807
00:38:16,995 --> 00:38:18,995
Brittney, the bride-to-be.

808
00:38:19,031 --> 00:38:21,564
Congratulations! And my,
look how much you've grown!

809
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:23,099
Thank you.
I'm so excited to see you.

810
00:38:23,135 --> 00:38:25,769
It's great to see you, too.

811
00:38:25,804 --> 00:38:28,772
Tanya, it's so good to see you,
and anything for an old friend.

812
00:38:28,807 --> 00:38:30,840
Chef Mi Young?

813
00:38:30,876 --> 00:38:33,643
Chef Mindy. I am so sorry.

814
00:38:33,679 --> 00:38:36,012
You know, you can't bring
everybody with you and you...

815
00:38:36,048 --> 00:38:38,581
Oh, no, no, no, no.
I'm impressed.

816
00:38:38,617 --> 00:38:40,984
Not too many Americans
know me by that name.

817
00:38:41,019 --> 00:38:43,687
I know, when she just kept
going on and on

818
00:38:43,722 --> 00:38:46,690
about this Chef Mindy, I had
no idea she was talking about

819
00:38:46,725 --> 00:38:51,027
the world-renowned pastry chef
Chef Mi Young!

820
00:38:51,063 --> 00:38:53,997
[speaking in foreign language]

821
00:39:00,739 --> 00:39:03,139
Yeah. Me. Excuse me. Okay.

822
00:39:03,175 --> 00:39:05,008
Could you, uh, please
go get the cake?

823
00:39:05,043 --> 00:39:07,143
Oh, yes, of course.

824
00:39:07,179 --> 00:39:08,645
Here they are. It's right here.

825
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:11,681
-[Mindy] Here they are.
-[Brittney gasps]

826
00:39:11,717 --> 00:39:13,183
Oh, look at the...

827
00:39:13,218 --> 00:39:15,185
-They're gorgeous!
-Oh!

828
00:39:15,220 --> 00:39:17,320
I really like the one
on the left.

829
00:39:17,355 --> 00:39:20,790
-Hmph.
-Hmph.

830
00:39:20,826 --> 00:39:23,827
-Hmph, what?
-Nothing.

831
00:39:23,862 --> 00:39:27,230
You... I really didn't mean
anything by it, honestly.

832
00:39:27,265 --> 00:39:29,199
Everybody has
their own preferences.

833
00:39:29,234 --> 00:39:32,368
I prefer the one on the right,
it's simple and rich,

834
00:39:32,404 --> 00:39:34,370
confident in who it is.

835
00:39:34,406 --> 00:39:36,973
It doesn't need to scream
"Here I am."

836
00:39:37,008 --> 00:39:39,008
[Mindy] Your taste
is exceptional.

837
00:39:39,044 --> 00:39:41,244
Most Westerners,
when they come in,

838
00:39:41,279 --> 00:39:44,247
their eyes go to the bigger,
more decorative cake.

839
00:39:44,282 --> 00:39:46,983
But, Brittney, you can't
go wrong with either one.

840
00:39:47,018 --> 00:39:49,819
Well, which one
do you choose, honey?

841
00:39:49,855 --> 00:39:52,222
-I think...
-Choose wisely.

842
00:39:53,792 --> 00:39:55,258
Brittney, look, simple.

843
00:39:55,293 --> 00:39:57,160
You like simple,
you said you do.

844
00:39:57,195 --> 00:39:58,194
Honey,
nothing simple about you, baby.

845
00:39:58,230 --> 00:40:00,230
Look at your hair
and all that product, honey.

846
00:40:00,265 --> 00:40:01,331
Come on,
choose the one that fits you.

847
00:40:01,366 --> 00:40:04,400
Your mother did that.
Simple, rich and confident.

848
00:40:04,436 --> 00:40:07,337
Mm! Shiny,
classic and everything.

[indistinct chatter]

850
00:40:09,241 --> 00:40:11,241
-Yeah.
-I-I don't know.

851
00:40:11,276 --> 00:40:13,343
You don't have to decide
right now.

852
00:40:13,378 --> 00:40:16,212
Oh, why don't I give you
some time? And I'll be back.

853
00:40:16,248 --> 00:40:18,248
-[Tanya] Mm-hmm.
-Mm-hmm. Oh.

[speaking in foreign language]

855
00:40:20,152 --> 00:40:21,417
You know what,
you put a sock in it!

856
00:40:21,453 --> 00:40:23,953
[Demetria screams]

857
00:40:23,989 --> 00:40:26,089
-Why did you do that?
-What? Please!

858
00:40:26,124 --> 00:40:28,258
-[coughs] It's peanuts!
-Are you okay?

859
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:37,934
You know, luckily,
the medic said that her throat

860
00:40:37,969 --> 00:40:40,737
should clear up soon and maybe
she'll even have her voice

861
00:40:40,772 --> 00:40:42,038
by morning.

862
00:40:42,073 --> 00:40:44,073
Okay, look,
how was I supposed to know

863
00:40:44,109 --> 00:40:45,809
that she was allergic to nuts?

864
00:40:45,844 --> 00:40:47,443
Okay, you weren't,
but how about it's not cool

865
00:40:47,479 --> 00:40:48,978
to force-feed a person?

866
00:40:49,014 --> 00:40:51,748
Ah. That's fair.

867
00:40:51,783 --> 00:40:55,418
-Oh, you wanna watch a movie?
-Are you serious right now?

868
00:40:55,453 --> 00:40:57,787
You know, Ms. Lawrence's throat
is swollen

869
00:40:57,823 --> 00:41:00,456
like a tennis ball,
you don't even like Amiri,

870
00:41:00,492 --> 00:41:02,659
and you're laying here
like everything is fine.

871
00:41:02,694 --> 00:41:04,928
Okay, Brittney,
it is not that bad, okay?

872
00:41:04,963 --> 00:41:07,797
Shh, bring it down.

873
00:41:07,833 --> 00:41:09,465
Now, I admit things
haven't been the smoothest.

874
00:41:09,501 --> 00:41:12,268
You know, mom,
I appreciate the fact

875
00:41:12,304 --> 00:41:15,805
that you're encouraged.
I really do.

876
00:41:18,443 --> 00:41:22,278
You know, I'm gonna go upstairs
and get some rest.

877
00:41:22,314 --> 00:41:23,379
[scoffs]

878
00:41:26,384 --> 00:41:27,817
Brittney!

879
00:41:29,054 --> 00:41:31,821
Mom, i-it's really not that bad.

880
00:41:33,225 --> 00:41:36,259
L-look,
I know we hit a rough patch,

881
00:41:36,294 --> 00:41:38,862
but I'm sure
tomorrow will be better.

882
00:41:38,897 --> 00:41:40,830
Mm-hmm?

883
00:41:40,866 --> 00:41:42,665
So you just gonna up and leave?

884
00:41:43,835 --> 00:41:46,336

885
00:41:56,314 --> 00:41:58,381
"I'm leaving to keep the peace.

886
00:41:58,416 --> 00:42:02,385
If I stay any longer, I'm going
to snatch off her wig."

887
00:42:02,420 --> 00:42:05,021
Okay, well,
that-that's a bit much.

888
00:42:05,056 --> 00:42:08,191
[mumbling]

889
00:42:16,534 --> 00:42:18,835
"She has no soul."

890
00:42:18,870 --> 00:42:20,303
Now you're just being mean.

891
00:42:20,338 --> 00:42:23,973
I understand, she can be
a bit of a handful,

892
00:42:24,009 --> 00:42:26,876
but it's not like you've been
a bucket of sunshine either.

893
00:42:26,912 --> 00:42:27,911
Mm-hmm?

"She's a cold,
lonely old woman."

897
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:50,233
Really, mom?

898
00:42:50,268 --> 00:42:52,068
Look, in all fairness
to Ms. Hamilton,

899
00:42:52,103 --> 00:42:55,571
she's the only one who didn't
even know about the engagement.

900
00:42:55,607 --> 00:42:59,042
So I think we need to be
a bit more understanding of her.

901
00:42:59,077 --> 00:43:01,577
[mumbling]

902
00:43:01,613 --> 00:43:04,280
And you know what?

903
00:43:04,316 --> 00:43:07,383
On second thought,
if that's the kind of energy

904
00:43:07,419 --> 00:43:09,252
you're gonna bring
in this house,

905
00:43:09,287 --> 00:43:12,088
then maybe you should leave.

906
00:43:12,123 --> 00:43:14,023
It's best you take it with you.

if you want to.

Well, good.

I brought you some of grandpa's
famous Earl Grey tea.

some of this tea

that it would bring me comfort

He's so inspirational.

he's kind, he's creative.

How well do you know him,
Brittney?

Well, about as well
as the person you've been

989
00:47:54,405 --> 00:47:55,738
getting to know for over a year.

990
00:47:55,773 --> 00:47:57,373
What?

991
00:47:57,408 --> 00:47:59,041
You've been dating him
for a year

992
00:47:59,077 --> 00:48:01,744
and I'm just now finding out
about him, Brittney?

993

[sighs] You know,
you were always good

994
00:48:03,681 --> 00:48:05,414
at keeping secrets from me.

995
00:48:05,450 --> 00:48:08,517
I'm sorry, mom, it just didn't
make any sense to tell you

996
00:48:08,553 --> 00:48:10,653
if you two
couldn't meet each other.

997
00:48:10,688 --> 00:48:12,321
I know if I told you
about Amiri,

998
00:48:12,357 --> 00:48:14,390
you'd be on the first plane
to USC.

999
00:48:14,425 --> 00:48:16,692
Yes, but...

1000
00:48:16,728 --> 00:48:21,230
Brittney...
you wanna marry this guy?

1001
00:48:21,266 --> 00:48:25,334
Come on, honey, you're so young.
You only have one semester left.

1002
00:48:25,370 --> 00:48:29,705
I know, mom, but I just wanna
create a new Christmas memory.

1003
00:48:31,209 --> 00:48:33,175
Okay.

1004
00:48:33,211 --> 00:48:37,213
I really regret
that we divorced on Christmas.

1005
00:48:37,248 --> 00:48:39,615
Okay, your father and I both do.

1006
00:48:39,651 --> 00:48:41,617
But, honey,
there was a lot going on.

1007
00:48:41,653 --> 00:48:44,520
I don't blame you guys for that.

1008
00:48:44,555 --> 00:48:49,125
I just think we all need
a fresh Christmas start.

1009
00:48:49,160 --> 00:48:50,393
Mm.

1010
00:48:51,829 --> 00:48:55,898
You know what?
I am in a place of Zen.

1011
00:48:55,933 --> 00:49:00,469
So I'm going to mind
my business for now.

1012
00:49:00,505 --> 00:49:02,271
Well, hallelujah.

1013
00:49:02,307 --> 00:49:04,640
You know, we should have started
with the massage.

1014
00:49:04,676 --> 00:49:06,442
-Exact.. Ooh.
-Ooh.

1015
00:49:06,477 --> 00:49:08,244
-Amiri!
-Hey. Sorry.

1016

Um, I told the guy at the front

1017
00:49:09,914 --> 00:49:12,281
that my<i> fiancee</i> and
her beautiful mother were here

1018
00:49:12,317 --> 00:49:14,750
and he told me to come in.
I didn't mean to intrude.

1019
00:49:14,786 --> 00:49:16,819
I just assumed you two
would have been done by now.

1020
00:49:16,854 --> 00:49:19,822
Amiri, you didn't get
my text message?

1021
00:49:19,857 --> 00:49:22,625
I sent you a message saying
we extended another two hours.

1022
00:49:22,660 --> 00:49:24,393
We were having a good time.

1023
00:49:24,429 --> 00:49:26,762
M-my fault.
I didn't check my phone.

1024
00:49:26,798 --> 00:49:28,631
Mm.

1025
00:49:28,666 --> 00:49:31,434
Well, you know what,
I'mma let you two lovebirds

1026
00:49:31,469 --> 00:49:33,502
go ahead and catch up.

1027
00:49:33,538 --> 00:49:35,938
I've spent enough time
with my baby.

1028
00:49:35,973 --> 00:49:38,574
And I'm sure
you're going through withdrawal.

1029
00:49:40,378 --> 00:49:41,777
Yeah. All right.

1030
00:49:48,986 --> 00:49:51,821
Sorry. I'm sorry,
I wasn't trying to interrupt.

1031
00:49:51,856 --> 00:49:55,791
[sighs] It's okay,
we were just having a good time,

1032
00:49:55,827 --> 00:49:59,261
but I think
she's finally in a better place.

1033
00:49:59,297 --> 00:50:02,631
-What about your mom?
-Uh, yeah, she's coming around.

1034
00:50:02,667 --> 00:50:04,467
She's in a good place, too.

1035
00:50:04,502 --> 00:50:08,504
Now if we can just get them both
in a good place together.

1036
00:50:08,539 --> 00:50:10,940
Right, but how?

1037
00:50:12,377 --> 00:50:13,576
Hm...

1038
00:50:16,047 --> 00:50:18,614
Surprise!

1039
00:50:18,649 --> 00:50:21,016
I figured we could spend
the evening drinking

1040
00:50:21,052 --> 00:50:23,419
and enjoying
Amiri's passion of painting.

1041
00:50:23,454 --> 00:50:26,021
Mm. Cool.

1042
00:50:26,057 --> 00:50:28,958
Hey, Jaylin,
I'm so happy you could make it.

1043
00:50:28,993 --> 00:50:30,726
-Oh, thanks for inviting.
-[Brittney] Of course.

1044
00:50:30,762 --> 00:50:32,795
Uh, we haven't been
properly introduced.

1045
00:50:32,830 --> 00:50:34,563
Oh, I'm sorry.
This is my mother.

1046
00:50:34,599 --> 00:50:36,298
Mrs. Demetria Lawrence.

1047
00:50:36,334 --> 00:50:37,900
Nice to meet you, Mrs. Lawrence.

1048
00:50:37,935 --> 00:50:40,703
Miss.
And you can call me Demetria.

1049
00:50:42,473 --> 00:50:46,041
All right, you smile any harder,
your lips gonna crack.

1050
00:50:46,077 --> 00:50:50,279
Hello, everyone, welcome
to Painting With A Twist,

1051
00:50:50,314 --> 00:50:52,548
where we like to sip and paint.

1052
00:50:52,583 --> 00:50:55,751
My name is Ted, and I will be
your host for the evening.

1053
00:50:55,787 --> 00:50:58,420
Has anyone been here before?

1054
00:50:58,456 --> 00:51:00,389
-Definitely not.
-Definitely not.

1055
00:51:00,424 --> 00:51:01,924
Oh, great!

1056
00:51:01,959 --> 00:51:05,427
-Well, follow me.
-Okay.

1057
00:51:05,463 --> 00:51:08,497
So as I previously stated,

1058
00:51:08,533 --> 00:51:12,334
here at Painting With A Twist,
you sip, you paint.

1059
00:51:12,370 --> 00:51:16,071
Hey! Oh, my God, we get it,
Pee-wee Herman.

1060
00:51:16,107 --> 00:51:19,341
Uh, because
it's that time of year,

1061
00:51:19,377 --> 00:51:22,845
uh, the object
that we will be painting is...

1062
00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:26,515
-Drum roll please...
-[drum roll]

1063
00:51:26,551 --> 00:51:28,684
A Christmas tree!

1064
00:51:28,719 --> 00:51:30,019
Go, get creative.

1065
00:51:30,054 --> 00:51:32,822
You can do
some more festive lights,

1066
00:51:32,857 --> 00:51:34,957
some candy canes, ornaments...

1067
00:51:34,992 --> 00:51:36,959
-Mm-hmm. We get it, Urkel.
-Oh.

1068
00:51:36,994 --> 00:51:39,028
[imitates Urkel]
Did you do that?

1069
00:51:39,063 --> 00:51:41,764
And the name's Ted,

1070
00:51:41,799 --> 00:51:44,934
and I can come by and assist.

1071
00:51:44,969 --> 00:51:47,503
Oh, we won't need that.
My son is a famous painter.

1072
00:51:47,538 --> 00:51:50,940
-Mom, it's-it's okay.
-Well, bravo for you.

1073
00:51:50,975 --> 00:51:53,475
-Okay, Ted, don't get cute.
-But I wasn't trying...

1074
00:51:53,511 --> 00:51:58,047
Well, you did. That's my son.
Close your mouth!

1075
00:51:58,082 --> 00:51:59,882
I don't think
this is a good idea. I think...

1076
00:51:59,917 --> 00:52:01,984
-We might be losing them.
-No, no, let 'em be.

1077
00:52:02,019 --> 00:52:03,452
Oddly enough, they seem
to get along when they're both

1078
00:52:03,487 --> 00:52:06,021
being mean, specifically
to this white dude,

1079
00:52:06,057 --> 00:52:08,390
but it's, it's fine.

1080
00:52:08,426 --> 00:52:11,493
-[Tanya laughing] Oh, God.
-[indistinct chatter]

1081
00:52:11,529 --> 00:52:15,030
-How about some wine for you?
-Oh. Thank you, Jaylin.

1082
00:52:16,434 --> 00:52:17,700
And some wine for you.

1083
00:52:17,735 --> 00:52:20,669
-Well, thank you.
-Don't worry.

1084
00:52:20,705 --> 00:52:23,405
Ooh. Is this for communion?

1085
00:52:23,441 --> 00:52:26,342
Oh, God, girl, I was thinking
the same damn thing.

1086
00:52:26,377 --> 00:52:28,844
Okay, see, that's what we get
at a paint and sip.

1087
00:52:28,880 --> 00:52:30,546
Okay, you know they gonna be
trying to give us

1088
00:52:30,581 --> 00:52:32,982
a bottle of wine, too, for free.

1089
00:52:33,017 --> 00:52:35,050
Uh, Ted!

1090
00:52:35,086 --> 00:52:36,752
Can you give me some water,
please?

1091
00:52:36,787 --> 00:52:38,520
-I'm a little parched.
-Sure thing.

1092
00:52:38,556 --> 00:52:40,089
And we can do
without the attitude, Ted.

1093
00:52:40,124 --> 00:52:41,824
-[Tanya] Ugh.
-Did you see that?

1094
00:52:41,859 --> 00:52:43,092
Mm-hmm. Just like his tiny tie.

1095
00:52:43,127 --> 00:52:45,928
Oh, God. You guys,
leave that poor guy alone.

1096
00:52:45,963 --> 00:52:47,763
You know what? Will you hush?

1097
00:52:47,798 --> 00:52:51,033
Yes. Chillax, Jaylin.

1098
00:52:51,068 --> 00:52:53,068
Let me see what you got going on
over there.

1099
00:52:55,740 --> 00:52:59,875
[gasps] Ooh, okay, okay.

1100
00:52:59,911 --> 00:53:02,111
I see where your son
gets his talent.

1101
00:53:02,146 --> 00:53:04,947
Thank you, love.

1102
00:53:04,982 --> 00:53:07,182
Wow!

1103
00:53:07,218 --> 00:53:08,951
You know,
I really like this, too.

1104
00:53:08,986 --> 00:53:11,553
It's so simple,
and just, it's classy.

1105
00:53:11,589 --> 00:53:15,190
Thank you. Well, it's simple
and sweet just like you.

1106
00:53:15,226 --> 00:53:17,793
No need to dress it up with
unnecessary things, you know?

1107
00:53:17,828 --> 00:53:20,529
You know, that's what I was
telling mom about the wedding.

1108
00:53:20,564 --> 00:53:22,464
I just wanna keep things simple,
you know?

1109
00:53:22,500 --> 00:53:26,035
I do, I do, but there's
nothing more disheartening

1110
00:53:26,070 --> 00:53:28,704
than an over-the-top,
gaudy wedding.

1111
00:53:28,739 --> 00:53:30,539
So self-serving.

1112
00:53:30,574 --> 00:53:33,542
It's like,
"Look at me, I'm important!"

1113
00:53:33,577 --> 00:53:35,778
[Demetria] I mean, whose wedding
is it anyway, right?

1114
00:53:35,813 --> 00:53:37,713
-Right?
-Right.

1115
00:53:37,748 --> 00:53:39,882
[Tanya laughing]

1116
00:53:41,485 --> 00:53:43,085
That's crazy. You know what?
This is true.

1117
00:53:43,120 --> 00:53:45,921
It is, it is.
But I do have to say.

1118
00:53:45,957 --> 00:53:48,791
You know, there's nothing wrong
with a little decor.

1119
00:53:48,826 --> 00:53:52,628
You know,
just to add a little zest.

1120
00:53:52,663 --> 00:53:55,764
Just a little bit.
Just that much.

1121
00:53:55,800 --> 00:53:58,167
You know what they say?

1122
00:53:58,202 --> 00:54:02,671
You know,
sometimes they say less is more!

1123
00:54:02,707 --> 00:54:04,773
[Tanya gasps]

1124
00:54:04,809 --> 00:54:07,509
Why, you little...
You know what?

1125
00:54:07,545 --> 00:54:10,946
Every Christmas tree
needs a couple of balls

1126
00:54:10,982 --> 00:54:14,116
dangling from it.
You know what I mean, huh?

1127
00:54:14,151 --> 00:54:18,087
Huh? Just like that.
Just like that.

1128
00:54:20,891 --> 00:54:25,194
No. No. No, you not.

1129
00:54:25,229 --> 00:54:28,630
You know, maybe we do need
a little zest.

1130
00:54:28,666 --> 00:54:30,165
Whoa!

1131
00:54:30,201 --> 00:54:34,269
There's a mustache
to match your beard.

1132
00:54:34,305 --> 00:54:35,070
Wax much?

1133
00:54:35,106 --> 00:54:37,806
You know what?
I will after this.

1134
00:54:37,842 --> 00:54:40,242
-Ah!
-Oh, oh...

1135
00:54:45,883 --> 00:54:47,816
No, don't. No.

1136
00:54:47,852 --> 00:54:50,119
That's definitely
going to be extra.

1137
00:54:52,323 --> 00:54:55,524
Thank you so much for giving me
a ride home.

1138
00:54:55,559 --> 00:54:59,561
I could not stand to ride home
with that woman.

1139
00:54:59,597 --> 00:55:01,296
You know, there's some clothes
in the top drawer

1140
00:55:01,332 --> 00:55:03,132
in the vanity in there.

1141
00:55:05,569 --> 00:55:08,771
[Jaylin] Thank you.
Are these it?

1142
00:55:09,840 --> 00:55:12,741
Oh. That's it.

1143
00:55:12,777 --> 00:55:15,844
Uh, you know, I, um,

1144
00:55:15,880 --> 00:55:17,179
hope you don't feel
uncomfortable

1145
00:55:17,214 --> 00:55:20,182
wearing
some of Craig's old stuff.

1146
00:55:20,217 --> 00:55:23,052
No more uncomfortable than
having paint in your underwear.

1147
00:55:23,087 --> 00:55:26,188
Hm. Don't mention underwear.

1148
00:55:26,223 --> 00:55:28,891
[laughs]
That's a little different.

1149
00:55:29,860 --> 00:55:31,160
[Tanya] All right.

1150
00:55:33,030 --> 00:55:36,331
You're big. I mean, strong.

1151
00:55:36,367 --> 00:55:39,768
Uh, bigger and stronger
than Craig looked

1152
00:55:39,804 --> 00:55:42,071
when he ever... Never mind.

1153
00:55:42,106 --> 00:55:46,208
Um, Jaylin,
look, I am so sorry, okay?

1154
00:55:46,243 --> 00:55:49,778
I never meant to get paint
all over you.

1155
00:55:49,814 --> 00:55:52,614
That's the thing, Tanya,
you keep plotting and scheming

1156
00:55:52,650 --> 00:55:56,118
and end up hitting
the wrong target.

1157
00:55:56,153 --> 00:55:59,354
-What about her?
-What about you, Tanya?

1158
00:55:59,390 --> 00:56:01,623
She was having a moment
with Brittney,

1159
00:56:01,659 --> 00:56:03,358
and you couldn't handle it.

1160
00:56:03,394 --> 00:56:05,761
[knocking on door]

1161
00:56:06,764 --> 00:56:08,263
Hey, Brit.

1162
00:56:08,299 --> 00:56:09,698
Goodnight, Tanya.

1163
00:56:14,672 --> 00:56:17,139
Hey, princess.

1164
00:56:17,174 --> 00:56:19,274
Okay, look, I know
tonight was horrible, all right?

1165
00:56:19,310 --> 00:56:22,077
But tomorrow's gonna be
so much better. I promise, okay?

1166
00:56:22,113 --> 00:56:25,747
And your wedding's gonna be
amazing!

1167
00:56:25,783 --> 00:56:30,052
That's actually what I came
to talk to you about, mom.

1168
00:56:30,087 --> 00:56:31,753
It seems like
planning this wedding

1169
00:56:31,789 --> 00:56:33,822
is driving you a little crazy.

1170
00:56:33,858 --> 00:56:38,093
And I think you need to focus
on just being my mom.

1171
00:56:38,129 --> 00:56:41,396
So no planning with the cake
and the decorations.

1172
00:56:41,432 --> 00:56:44,066
I think I just...

1173
00:56:44,101 --> 00:56:45,968
I wanna leave it up
to Mrs. Lawrence.

1174
00:56:46,003 --> 00:56:47,336
Should handle the logistics

1175
00:56:47,371 --> 00:56:49,238
because she and I
have similar tastes.

1176
00:56:50,708 --> 00:56:51,874
Really?

1177
00:56:52,776 --> 00:56:53,909
I see.

1178
00:56:55,379 --> 00:56:58,213
I mean, mom, you still can plan.
There's a few...

1179
00:56:58,582 --> 00:57:00,215
It's fine.

1180
00:57:01,285 --> 00:57:02,384
I get it.

1181
00:57:03,988 --> 00:57:08,056
-Okay.

that you had for the wedding,

if you would wanna help.

1190
00:57:36,020 --> 00:57:38,787
[laughs] Darling,

1191

I would love to!

And I need to apologize.

1193

I misjudged you
when I first met you.

1194

you're the daughter I never had.

But... truth of the matter is,

1252
01:00:58,972 --> 01:01:00,639
I really think you're talented.

1253
01:01:00,674 --> 01:01:02,340
And I know
I give you a lot of stuff,

1254

but, uh, it's not about you.

1255
01:01:05,646 --> 01:01:07,112
So I know
your mama gotta be proud

1256
01:01:07,147 --> 01:01:08,113
of everything you're doing.

1258
01:01:11,118 --> 01:01:12,284
Yeah.

1259
01:01:12,319 --> 01:01:14,686
Uh, my mom
was raised as royalty.

1260
01:01:14,721 --> 01:01:16,688
I'm talking servants, guards,
you name it.

1261
01:01:16,723 --> 01:01:21,193
So impressing her
isn't an easy task.

1262
01:01:21,228 --> 01:01:22,694
-Wow!
-Yeah.

1263
01:01:22,729 --> 01:01:24,696
Servants?

1264
01:01:24,731 --> 01:01:27,265
Yeah. Thank you.

1265
01:01:27,301 --> 01:01:28,934
Her parents were part of

1266
01:01:28,969 --> 01:01:31,436
one of the wealthiest tribes
in South Africa, so...

1267
01:01:31,472 --> 01:01:32,704
That's why she had that feather.

1268
01:01:32,739 --> 01:01:36,041
Yeah. The feather, the robe,
all. Yeah.

1269
01:01:36,076 --> 01:01:38,643
No. Hm. Don't remind me.

1270
01:01:38,679 --> 01:01:40,479
The thought of her
doing anything for herself

1271
01:01:40,514 --> 01:01:43,281
was actually frowned upon.

1272
01:01:43,317 --> 01:01:44,983
And when she met my father,

1273
01:01:45,018 --> 01:01:48,220
he was already a world-renowned
orthopedic surgeon.

1274
01:01:48,255 --> 01:01:50,122
-Wow.
-Yeah.

1275
01:01:50,157 --> 01:01:54,392
So the plan was for me
to follow in his footsteps.

1276
01:01:54,428 --> 01:01:55,560
Mm-hmm.

1277
01:01:55,596 --> 01:02:00,065
But, you know,
it just wasn't me.

1278
01:02:00,100 --> 01:02:02,501
You know, I had,
I had to find my own path.

1279
01:02:03,770 --> 01:02:05,670
I fell in love
with the paint brush.

1280
01:02:05,706 --> 01:02:06,671
Hm.

1281
01:02:08,275 --> 01:02:10,976
And she was devastated

1282
01:02:11,011 --> 01:02:12,577
when I decided
not to go to medical school.

1283
01:02:12,613 --> 01:02:16,114
-Mm.
-She even tried to pay me.

1284
01:02:17,117 --> 01:02:18,383
-She did?
-Mm-hmm.

1285
01:02:18,418 --> 01:02:21,553
-How much?
-A lot.

1286
01:02:21,588 --> 01:02:24,222
-[laughs] A lot, like what?
-Hm.

1287
01:02:24,258 --> 01:02:27,325

-A lot.

01:02:31,198 --> 01:02:33,632

That is commendable.

I guess.

1293
01:02:38,539 --> 01:02:42,507
I think after my dad was gone,

1294
01:02:42,543 --> 01:02:45,177
the only thing
she was holding on to was

1295
01:02:45,212 --> 01:02:46,745
me following his legacy.

1296
01:02:46,780 --> 01:02:48,513
Wow.

1297
01:02:48,549 --> 01:02:51,016
So, yeah, on-on the surface,

1298
01:02:51,051 --> 01:02:54,686
she loves to talk
about her son, the artist.

1299
01:02:54,721 --> 01:02:59,424
But I know she would prefer
her son, the doctor.

can't see your greatness.

a whole wedding without me?

01:05:55,819 --> 01:05:57,786
-The-the rehearsal dinner.
-What dinner?

1352
01:05:57,821 --> 01:05:59,821
The rehearsal dinner
for our wedding.

1353
01:05:59,856 --> 01:06:01,389
Oh, God!

1354
01:06:01,425 --> 01:06:03,858
[indistinct chatter]

1355
01:06:03,894 --> 01:06:05,960
-Oh, my God.
-Go grab my bag, baby.

1356
01:06:05,996 --> 01:06:08,530
Oh, my feet won't move.
Wait, I gotta pee.

1357
01:06:08,565 --> 01:06:09,964
[door opens]

1358
01:06:11,868 --> 01:06:13,668
-Thanks.
-Have you seen Tanya?

1359
01:06:13,704 --> 01:06:15,470
She's talking to the driver.

1360
01:06:18,675 --> 01:06:21,643
[footsteps approaching]

1361
01:06:21,678 --> 01:06:24,212
Babe, I got some good news.

1362
01:06:24,247 --> 01:06:27,382
Where have you been? I've been
calling you for over an hour.

1363
01:06:27,417 --> 01:06:29,584
I know, I just saw my phone.

1364
01:06:29,619 --> 01:06:31,519
But here's the thing.
Guess what.

1365
01:06:32,522 --> 01:06:34,889
Oh, okay, maybe not.

1366
01:06:34,925 --> 01:06:37,225
Me and your mom
are best friends.

1367
01:06:37,260 --> 01:06:39,828
-Amiri, please.
-Again with the missed calls.

1368
01:06:39,863 --> 01:06:40,862
Are you being serious right now?

1369
01:06:40,897 --> 01:06:42,363
Did you not hear
what I just said?

1370
01:06:42,399 --> 01:06:44,032
[Brittney]
Are you being serious right now?

1371
01:06:44,067 --> 01:06:45,934
I'm supposed to believe
you were with my mother?

1372
01:06:45,969 --> 01:06:46,868
You know, I can't get
in touch with you

1373
01:06:46,903 --> 01:06:49,504
and you can't see
why that's a problem.

1374
01:06:49,539 --> 01:06:51,406
Babe, please. Just hear me out.

1375
01:06:51,441 --> 01:06:54,542
How am I supposed to trust a man
that gives me reason not to?

1376
01:06:55,746 --> 01:06:58,379
Isn't that what you said, mom?

1377
01:06:58,415 --> 01:07:00,415
What, cat's got your tongue?

1378
01:07:00,450 --> 01:07:02,050
Why don't you tell your little
drinking buddy what you said?

1379
01:07:02,085 --> 01:07:06,755
Okay, princess, look,
that was way before

1380
01:07:06,790 --> 01:07:09,257
I actually had a chance
to even get to know him.

1381
01:07:09,292 --> 01:07:10,792
Okay, so now you've had a
few drinks, you can actually...

1382
01:07:10,827 --> 01:07:12,894
-See the good in people?
-Brit-Brit.

1383
01:07:12,929 --> 01:07:14,395
Don't talk to your mother
like that.

1384
01:07:14,431 --> 01:07:15,764
You know what, don't you tell

1385
01:07:15,799 --> 01:07:16,865
my daughter
how she should speak.

1386
01:07:16,900 --> 01:07:18,600
[Demetria] Like you know how to

1387
01:07:18,635 --> 01:07:20,068
speak to her all of a sudden.

1388
01:07:20,103 --> 01:07:22,470
Okay, you know what,
you need to worry about

1389
01:07:22,506 --> 01:07:24,739
getting to know your own child.

1390
01:07:24,775 --> 01:07:25,974
What's that supposed to mean?

1391
01:07:26,009 --> 01:07:28,376
You so worried
about your damn legacy,

1392
01:07:28,411 --> 01:07:30,678
you won't give him a chance
to create his.

1393
01:07:32,916 --> 01:07:36,584
Amiri, is that how you feel?

1394
01:07:39,122 --> 01:07:40,588
[sighs]

1395
01:07:45,996 --> 01:07:46,928
I see.

1396
01:07:56,973 --> 01:07:58,606
You did that.

1397
01:08:00,544 --> 01:08:03,444
I'm sorry, Brittney.

1398
01:08:03,480 --> 01:08:05,680
-I'm sorry.
-No.

1399
01:08:05,715 --> 01:08:08,850
You got what you wanted, right?

1400
01:08:08,885 --> 01:08:11,519
And I've always respected that
about you.

1401
01:08:11,555 --> 01:08:15,990
Your by-any-means-necessary
approach to get what you want.

1402
01:08:16,026 --> 01:08:18,059
I just didn't know
that it applied to me.

1403
01:08:19,629 --> 01:08:22,096
-Baby.
-I'm not your baby.

1404
01:08:25,168 --> 01:08:28,970
Wow. I'm sorry.

1405
01:08:36,079 --> 01:08:38,112
You're not gonna go
after your mother?

1406
01:08:39,749 --> 01:08:41,449
I'm trying to be here for you
right now.

1407
01:08:41,484 --> 01:08:44,152
Right now was when
I was calling you earlier.

1408
01:08:44,187 --> 01:08:47,355
God, it's like
you are so freaking impulsive.

1409
01:08:47,390 --> 01:08:49,524
You know,
it seems romantic and exciting,

1410
01:08:49,559 --> 01:08:51,092
but really, it's inconsiderate.

1411
01:08:53,029 --> 01:08:55,496
You'd have some accountability,
Amiri.

1412
01:08:57,701 --> 01:09:00,869
I love that you're spontaneous,

1413
01:09:00,904 --> 01:09:02,770
that you're not married
to time...

1414
01:09:04,074 --> 01:09:08,176
but there really has to be
something

1415
01:09:08,211 --> 01:09:10,011
that you care about.

1416
01:09:14,117 --> 01:09:16,684
Maybe we are rushing
into things.

1417
01:09:19,522 --> 01:09:22,023
[instrumental music]

1418
01:09:52,122 --> 01:09:55,056
[music continues]

1419
01:10:20,734 --> 01:10:23,735
-Hey.
-Hey.

1420
01:10:23,770 --> 01:10:27,605
Look, if you're here to make up,
you better grab an apron.

1421
01:10:27,641 --> 01:10:31,509
Oh, but I forgot. You probably
have a wait staff, right?

1422
01:10:31,544 --> 01:10:33,911
[laughs] I do.

1423
01:10:33,947 --> 01:10:37,582
But I also watch
a lot of Chef Mi Young.

1424
01:10:37,617 --> 01:10:41,853
[laughs] You know, I don't know
what I hate more.

1425
01:10:41,888 --> 01:10:43,888
The fact that you speak
fluent Korean

1426
01:10:43,923 --> 01:10:46,024
or the fact that Chef Mi Young

1427
01:10:46,059 --> 01:10:48,726
likes you
more than she likes me.

1428
01:10:48,762 --> 01:10:51,062
-Wow, I'm impressed.
-Mm.

1429
01:10:51,097 --> 01:10:52,697
I know sharing that had to hurt.

1430
01:10:52,732 --> 01:10:56,100
Ugh. More than you know.

1431
01:10:56,136 --> 01:10:59,570
Well, it's only fair
that I return the favor.

1432
01:10:59,606 --> 01:11:03,041
Uh, you don't have to.

1433
01:11:03,076 --> 01:11:05,643
-Yes, you do.
-I figured.

1434
01:11:05,679 --> 01:11:08,613
Okay. Here goes.

1435
01:11:08,648 --> 01:11:10,648
[clears throat]

1436
01:11:10,684 --> 01:11:14,919
I am... somewhat

1437
01:11:14,954 --> 01:11:17,221
intimidated by you.

1438
01:11:17,257 --> 01:11:19,791
Oh... Really?

1439
01:11:19,826 --> 01:11:23,094
Okay, you know what, you are
pouring it on way too thick now.

1440
01:11:23,129 --> 01:11:24,762
No, I'm serious.

1441
01:11:25,832 --> 01:11:29,934
Amiri is so impressed

1442
01:11:29,969 --> 01:11:32,503
that you own your own business.

1443
01:11:32,539 --> 01:11:35,807
He's always like,
"She's a self-starter.

1444
01:11:35,842 --> 01:11:37,942
Nobody ever gave her anything."

1445
01:11:41,014 --> 01:11:42,947
I can't compete with that.

1446
01:11:43,783 --> 01:11:45,083
That's not true.

1447
01:11:45,952 --> 01:11:49,987
Amiri adores you. He does.

1448
01:11:50,023 --> 01:11:52,156
Okay, I just think that

1449
01:11:52,192 --> 01:11:54,125
you need to care a little bit
more about what he does.

1450
01:11:54,160 --> 01:11:56,094
-I do care.
-Oh. Pfft.

1451
01:11:56,129 --> 01:11:58,529
I don't.

1452
01:11:58,565 --> 01:12:02,166
But I'm just so...
I mean, I do. I do.

1453
01:12:02,202 --> 01:12:04,135
-I just, I just don't get it.
-Really?

1454
01:12:04,170 --> 01:12:07,839
He's not asking you to get it.

1455
01:12:07,874 --> 01:12:10,007
All he wants you to do is just

1456
01:12:10,043 --> 01:12:13,678
accept the path
that he's chosen.

1457
01:12:13,713 --> 01:12:14,946
That's it.

1458
01:12:16,683 --> 01:12:20,184
Okay. My turn.

1459
01:12:20,220 --> 01:12:22,320
Brittney doesn't like me either,
does she?

1460
01:12:22,355 --> 01:12:23,321
Nah, not really.

1461
01:12:23,356 --> 01:12:25,656
-Oh. Damn.
-No.

1462
01:12:25,692 --> 01:12:28,092
-Girl, we gotta fix this. Yeah.
-Pretty much.

1463
01:12:30,263 --> 01:12:32,130
[knocking on door]

1464
01:12:32,165 --> 01:12:34,165
Where's your drinking buddy?

1465
01:12:34,200 --> 01:12:37,268
-I've been avoiding her all day.
-Cute.

1466
01:12:39,339 --> 01:12:41,038
[sighs]

1467
01:12:41,074 --> 01:12:44,075
She's downstairs in the kitchen
with my mother.

1468
01:12:44,110 --> 01:12:48,012
I actually think
I overheard them making up.

1469
01:12:52,886 --> 01:12:54,886
Are we ready for this?

1470
01:12:54,921 --> 01:12:58,523
I mean, really ready?

1471
01:13:00,293 --> 01:13:02,193
Yeah. Yeah, I am.

1472
01:13:04,631 --> 01:13:06,130
Are you?

1473
01:13:07,233 --> 01:13:08,900
Yeah.

1474
01:13:08,935 --> 01:13:10,234
But you have to answer
your phone.

1475
01:13:10,270 --> 01:13:13,104
-Oh, done.
-No, I'm serious.

1476
01:13:13,139 --> 01:13:14,906
You know, sometimes
you just have to be present

1477
01:13:14,941 --> 01:13:17,041
and have a plan.

1478
01:13:21,147 --> 01:13:22,980
Am I turning into my mother?

1479
01:13:25,084 --> 01:13:27,618
Like, planning a wedding
is hard.

1480
01:13:27,654 --> 01:13:29,754
I wasn't prepared to do this
by myself.

1481
01:13:29,789 --> 01:13:31,355
Well, I thought
that's what you wanted to do.

1482
01:13:31,391 --> 01:13:34,225
It's bigger than the wedding,
Amiri.

1483
01:13:34,260 --> 01:13:37,762
I'm talking about our future.

1484
01:13:37,797 --> 01:13:40,598
You know, I love that you march
to the beat of your own drum,

1485
01:13:40,633 --> 01:13:45,870
but you have to make sure that
I'm there marching with you.

1486
01:13:45,905 --> 01:13:48,072
You know, this whole time I've
been trying not to be my mother

1487
01:13:48,107 --> 01:13:52,343
and be this carefree spirit,
but it's not me.

1488
01:13:54,447 --> 01:13:59,116
But that's what I love
about our love.

1489
01:13:59,152 --> 01:14:00,885
Our differences give us
the balance we need

1490
01:14:00,920 --> 01:14:05,223
to grow into whatever we want.

1491
01:14:05,258 --> 01:14:08,926
That was,
that was really beautiful.

1492
01:14:13,433 --> 01:14:16,934
But you sound
like a fortune cookie.

1493
01:14:16,970 --> 01:14:18,736
[laughing]

1494
01:14:18,771 --> 01:14:20,238
I'm just playing.

1495
01:14:20,273 --> 01:14:22,607
-I love you.
-I love you, too.

1496
01:14:28,848 --> 01:14:31,816
-So we're gonna do it.
-Hell, yeah, we're gonna do it.

1497
01:14:31,851 --> 01:14:32,950
[laughs]

1498
01:14:32,986 --> 01:14:36,120
[instrumental music]

1499
01:15:05,051 --> 01:15:06,484
[knocking on door]

1500
01:15:06,519 --> 01:15:10,121
-Hey there.
-Hey.

1501
01:15:10,156 --> 01:15:11,155
Brittney,
I feel like an old fool.

1502
01:15:11,190 --> 01:15:13,057
-No.
-I should've never...

1503
01:15:13,092 --> 01:15:17,028
Mom, I'm really sorry.

1504
01:15:17,063 --> 01:15:18,996
-You're sorry?
-Yeah.

1505
01:15:21,401 --> 01:15:24,735
You know,
I've just been so worried

1506
01:15:24,771 --> 01:15:26,037
about you over-crowding me

1507
01:15:26,072 --> 01:15:29,173
that I guess I never stopped

1508
01:15:29,208 --> 01:15:32,043
to ask myself why that is.

1509
01:15:32,078 --> 01:15:35,212
Planning a wedding is hard.

1510
01:15:35,248 --> 01:15:36,981
And it's dumb
to do it by myself,

1511
01:15:37,016 --> 01:15:41,018
especially when I have
the greatest coach in my corner

1512
01:15:41,054 --> 01:15:42,486
rooting for me to win.

1513
01:15:43,523 --> 01:15:47,224
Wow. Brittney...

1514
01:15:47,260 --> 01:15:50,194
I'm speechless. I am.

1515
01:15:50,229 --> 01:15:53,497
[sighs]
Thank you.

1516
01:15:53,533 --> 01:15:58,269
Mom, there's so much
that I love about you.

1517
01:15:58,304 --> 01:16:02,873
You're a smart, intelligent,

1518
01:16:02,909 --> 01:16:04,875
nurturing woman.

1519
01:16:04,911 --> 01:16:06,444
[sighs]

1520
01:16:06,479 --> 01:16:09,447
No, mom,

Now, if I do that,
you promise me that you will...

1529
01:16:31,571 --> 01:16:34,572
[inhales] you gotta communicate
with me more.

1530

-Agreed.
-Okay?

like the fat kid loves cake.

1695
01:25:16,979 --> 01:25:19,847
[applauding]

1696
01:25:19,882 --> 01:25:22,983
[instrumental music]

1697
01:25:30,893 --> 01:25:32,226
You wanna go out there?

1698
01:25:32,261 --> 01:25:34,895
Uh, maybe later.

1699
01:25:34,930 --> 01:25:37,664
Looks like
mema got the spotlight now.

1700
01:25:37,700 --> 01:25:39,499
I don't wanna steal her shine.

1701
01:25:39,535 --> 01:25:41,835
[laughing]

1702
01:25:42,571 --> 01:25:43,937
[sighs]

1703
01:25:45,574 --> 01:25:48,675
-You okay?
-Yeah.

1704
01:25:48,711 --> 01:25:51,979
I just cannot believe
they actually got married.

1705
01:25:52,014 --> 01:25:54,781
I mean, after all the mess
I put them through.

1706
01:25:56,552 --> 01:25:58,085
I'm a lot, huh?

1707
01:25:58,120 --> 01:26:00,153
-[chuckles] Yeah, you are.
-Oh.

1708
01:26:00,189 --> 01:26:02,055
Okay, so then
why do you put up with me?

1709
01:26:02,091 --> 01:26:05,259
-That is a good question.
-Mm.

1710
01:26:05,294 --> 01:26:07,060
I don't know,
maybe it's the passion

1711
01:26:07,096 --> 01:26:09,162
you put in your family,
you know?

1712
01:26:09,198 --> 01:26:13,667
The drive
you putting in your work.

1713
01:26:13,702 --> 01:26:16,003
Or maybe it's those damn lips
I've been waiting to kiss

1714
01:26:16,038 --> 01:26:18,872
ever since
you got back on the market.

1715
01:26:18,908 --> 01:26:21,208
Oh, look at that.

1716
01:26:24,947 --> 01:26:27,080
Well, it's about time!

1717
01:26:27,116 --> 01:26:29,216
Ah. What are you talking about?

1718
01:26:29,251 --> 01:26:31,518
I'm just saying.

1719
01:26:31,553 --> 01:26:34,588
Whatever.
We are grown, Mrs. Lawrence.

1720
01:26:34,623 --> 01:26:38,225
Mm-hmm. Well, just don't hit me
with any surprises.

1721
01:26:38,260 --> 01:26:40,761
Okay, just don't hit me
with that fan.

1722
01:26:40,796 --> 01:26:41,895
-We good.
-Love y'all.

1723
01:26:41,931 --> 01:26:43,196
I love you, babe.

1724
01:26:45,334 --> 01:26:46,767
Mm...

1725
01:26:47,803 --> 01:26:49,770
Come here.

1726
01:26:49,805 --> 01:26:52,739

01:26:59,682 --> 01:27:02,849
