1
00:02:20,442 --> 00:02:21,511
No.

2
00:02:35,682 --> 00:02:37,877
Please... Please.

3
00:02:39,042 --> 00:02:41,078
l beg you.

4
00:02:41,282 --> 00:02:43,398
l beg you.

5
00:02:43,482 --> 00:02:45,677
l'm only here to help you.

6
00:03:28,202 --> 00:03:30,397
Hello. Uffizi.

7
00:03:35,002 --> 00:03:37,994
- Fucking pig.
- This is going to hurt.

8
00:03:38,082 --> 00:03:42,200
- You want me. don't you?
- Take that cross and shove it up your ass.

9
00:03:43,962 --> 00:03:46,635
Oh. not nice.

10
00:03:46,722 --> 00:03:49,190
l want to lick you

11
00:03:49,282 --> 00:03:52,274
and suck you dry.

12
00:04:01,842 --> 00:04:04,310
Uffizi. no!

13
00:05:19,882 --> 00:05:23,955
No!

14
00:05:59,682 --> 00:06:01,991
Death...

15
00:06:02,082 --> 00:06:05,961
is the inevitable consequence of life.

16
00:06:07,722 --> 00:06:11,078
Our bodies are doomed to fail.

17
00:06:11,162 --> 00:06:14,154
Some. unfortunately.

18
00:06:14,242 --> 00:06:18,030
are doomed to fail sooner than others.

19
00:06:18,122 --> 00:06:21,592
Failure is the most important lesson

20
00:06:21,682 --> 00:06:25,595
you will learn
in the medical profession.

21
00:06:25,682 --> 00:06:30,756
Some of you secretly
indulge the conceit

22
00:06:30,842 --> 00:06:33,515
that you will succeed
in the face of God.

23
00:06:33,602 --> 00:06:38,517
that you will learn to defy death.

24
00:06:38,602 --> 00:06:41,116
l know.

25
00:06:41,202 --> 00:06:45,354
l did too. once upon a time.

26
00:06:45,442 --> 00:06:47,876
- Are you lovebirds quarrelling again?
- No.

27
00:06:47,962 --> 00:06:52,353
We're just discussing Lizzie's
favourite subject. my impending demise.

28
00:06:52,442 --> 00:06:57,960
- That's it. l'm outta here.
- No. no. l'm done. l swear. Honest. OK?

29
00:06:58,442 --> 00:06:59,636
All better.

30
00:06:59,722 --> 00:07:04,398
- Where's Kenny?
- There. paying down his student loans.

31
00:07:09,642 --> 00:07:11,678
- Could you be more obvious?
- What?

32
00:07:11,762 --> 00:07:14,356
You were dealing drugs
to Professor Whelan?

33
00:07:14,442 --> 00:07:18,640
- Knock-off Viagra. actually.
- He'll be fishing on that rod all week long.

34
00:07:18,722 --> 00:07:24,001
- And you're all right with that?
- As long as his old lady's cool.

35
00:07:24,082 --> 00:07:26,198
Here.

36
00:07:26,282 --> 00:07:28,750
Would you put that thing away?

37
00:07:30,322 --> 00:07:33,758
- Lost again.
- Here. Hose down those willies. girl.

38
00:07:33,842 --> 00:07:36,834
l can't. lt's a work night.

39
00:07:37,562 --> 00:07:40,554
- You'll put him to bed?
- No. l'll stick a light bulb up his ass.

40
00:07:40,642 --> 00:07:42,633
Turn him into a beer sign.

41
00:07:42,722 --> 00:07:46,476
- Home by midnight. l mean it.
- Get outta here. Mom. Kids wanna play.

42
00:07:46,562 --> 00:07:48,553
Midnight.

43
00:07:50,162 --> 00:07:52,312
- Here's to MOB.
- What's MOB?

44
00:07:52,402 --> 00:07:54,711
Money Over Bitches.

45
00:08:21,402 --> 00:08:25,793
- Fire sale. Where do you want him?
- Put him on four.

46
00:08:25,882 --> 00:08:27,873
On four.

47
00:08:29,442 --> 00:08:32,639
- We got something special for you today.
- What do we got?

48
00:08:32,722 --> 00:08:35,520
Homicide. suicide.
natural causes. or what?

49
00:08:35,602 --> 00:08:39,436
- l'm gonna go with ''or what''.
- One. two. three. lift.

50
00:08:39,522 --> 00:08:41,956
Grabbed him on a field
near Jackson Square.

51
00:08:42,042 --> 00:08:45,034
Someone hung him on a cross
and burned him alive.

52
00:08:45,122 --> 00:08:48,319
That's pleasant. That's really nice.

53
00:08:54,402 --> 00:08:56,313
All dressed up for Ash Wednesday.

54
00:08:56,402 --> 00:08:59,121
Blessed and cremated at the same time.
Later.

55
00:08:59,202 --> 00:09:01,921
Do you mind giving me a hand here?
Boss left early.

56
00:09:02,002 --> 00:09:06,041
l got a midterm in 90 minutes. No one
told me l'd have to process another DB.

57
00:09:06,122 --> 00:09:09,751
- Are you kidding? l love this shit.
- Thanks.

58
00:09:10,642 --> 00:09:13,679
OK. We're definitely
gonna need some dental plates.

59
00:09:13,762 --> 00:09:17,232
- Can a body burn this much on its own?
- Not without an accelerant.

60
00:09:17,322 --> 00:09:19,233
Get me some scrapings. will you?

61
00:09:19,322 --> 00:09:21,313
Excellent.

62
00:09:37,362 --> 00:09:41,275
That's weird.
These burns are mostly superficial.

63
00:09:41,642 --> 00:09:43,519
Hey. Luke. check this out.

64
00:09:43,602 --> 00:09:50,041
Liver and all the other organs are white.
like they've never touched a drop of blood.

65
00:09:50,122 --> 00:09:53,592
- You know what this means. don't you?
- Educate me.

66
00:09:53,682 --> 00:09:57,914
- He got his blood from somewhere else.
- Come on.

67
00:09:58,002 --> 00:10:03,281
- You have a better explanation?
- Contact with water turns liver tissue white.

68
00:10:03,362 --> 00:10:08,152
Elizabeth. the guy was found
hanging from a cross. burning.

69
00:10:10,482 --> 00:10:13,155
At dawn.

70
00:10:13,242 --> 00:10:15,358
No way. No.

71
00:10:15,442 --> 00:10:17,637
- Check his teeth.
- No. no. This is crazy.

72
00:10:17,722 --> 00:10:21,431
- Tell me l'm bullshitting. Check his teeth.
- Fine.

73
00:10:30,202 --> 00:10:32,397
l guess l'm full of shit.

74
00:10:37,682 --> 00:10:40,150
That's weird.

75
00:10:47,002 --> 00:10:49,880
- Christ!
- What?

76
00:10:54,722 --> 00:10:56,713
Oh. shit.

77
00:11:05,442 --> 00:11:08,036
Shit. l was right.

78
00:11:08,122 --> 00:11:11,432
l was right!
Shit. we've got a vampire.

79
00:11:11,522 --> 00:11:15,356
We bagged us a vampire. We bagged
us a vampire. We got us a vampire.

80
00:11:15,442 --> 00:11:17,672
Oh. shit.

81
00:11:20,162 --> 00:11:22,198
l'll be right back.

82
00:11:23,522 --> 00:11:26,241
Where are you going?

83
00:11:47,362 --> 00:11:50,035
- Yeah?
- Lowell. OK. don't go all academic on me.

84
00:11:50,122 --> 00:11:53,478
- Lizzie. what...?
- l got something down here.

85
00:11:53,562 --> 00:11:57,237
Something that can't exist. but it does.

86
00:11:57,322 --> 00:11:59,597
At least. l think it does.

87
00:12:12,082 --> 00:12:14,118
You found a what?

88
00:12:14,202 --> 00:12:17,353
- A vampire?
- You don't believe me. do you?

89
00:12:17,442 --> 00:12:21,151
Well. it's not that l don't believe you.
l just...

90
00:12:21,242 --> 00:12:23,233
You know. l understand. really.

91
00:12:23,322 --> 00:12:27,110
l mean. God. l wouldn't believe me either.
especially if l was you.

92
00:12:31,562 --> 00:12:33,757
You may look dead...

93
00:12:39,442 --> 00:12:40,431
Garden room.

94
00:12:40,522 --> 00:12:44,071
You have a body on your slab
unlike any other you have seen.

95
00:12:44,162 --> 00:12:46,073
- Who is this?
- Opportunity.

96
00:12:46,162 --> 00:12:50,838
l want the body
and l'll make you rich to get it. Hello?

97
00:12:56,842 --> 00:13:00,357
A body was delivered here in the last hour.
badly burned.

98
00:13:05,602 --> 00:13:08,594
- There was the strangest call just now.
- Who was it?

99
00:13:08,682 --> 00:13:14,757
l haven't a clue. but whoever it was just
offered 30 million large for our friend here.

100
00:13:16,802 --> 00:13:20,158
- l'm waiting for the punch line.
- You just heard it.

101
00:13:24,602 --> 00:13:27,400
What does this mystery caller
want with the body?

102
00:13:27,482 --> 00:13:32,510
Do the math. 30 mil is pocket change if we
can figure out what makes this thing tick.

103
00:13:32,602 --> 00:13:36,515
lmmortality on sale
at a morgue near you.

104
00:13:36,602 --> 00:13:39,639
Wait. OK. hold on a minute.
We need to think this through.

105
00:13:39,722 --> 00:13:42,361
Why don't we get some experts in here?

106
00:13:42,442 --> 00:13:44,433
Who? The CDC?

107
00:13:44,522 --> 00:13:47,912
The FBl? The NRA?
Fucking Pete Corello?

108
00:13:48,002 --> 00:13:54,350
Jesus. Elizabeth. think. Why is it that not
one single vampire has ever been found?

109
00:13:54,842 --> 00:13:58,437
lt's because they disappear.
or someone makes them disappear.

110
00:13:58,522 --> 00:14:01,559
- along with any credible witnesses.
- Men in black.

111
00:14:05,162 --> 00:14:08,074
- Remember the John Doe from the fire?
- No. no. we can't.

112
00:14:08,162 --> 00:14:11,791
- We'll make a switch. Who's gonna know?
- Luke!

113
00:14:11,882 --> 00:14:14,794
So they get some drunk
instead of a vampire. So what?

114
00:14:14,882 --> 00:14:17,316
They'll put the body away
in some secret stash.

115
00:14:17,402 --> 00:14:21,759
- This is insane.
- No. Elizabeth. Not doing this is insane.

116
00:14:21,842 --> 00:14:27,951
$30 million. $30 million for the secret
of eternal life. or business as usual.

117
00:15:06,682 --> 00:15:08,798
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

118
00:15:11,042 --> 00:15:14,717
- l'm here to give last rites.
- lt's a little late for that. isn't it?

119
00:15:14,802 --> 00:15:19,080
- Never too late to save a soul.
- Someone'll help you in a minute.

120
00:15:20,722 --> 00:15:22,440
l don't have a minute.

121
00:15:24,042 --> 00:15:26,636
Can l help you with something?

122
00:15:26,722 --> 00:15:28,155
Yes.

123
00:15:35,282 --> 00:15:38,274
- Yeah. it must be this one.
- Thank you.

124
00:15:38,922 --> 00:15:41,834
- What the hell took you so long?
- Go. go. go!

125
00:16:38,162 --> 00:16:42,155
Mr Big wants us to meet him
at the last turn-off before the interstate.

126
00:17:03,282 --> 00:17:05,671
Fuck me. Shit. Fuck.

127
00:17:18,842 --> 00:17:21,037
Get out. l'm driving.

128
00:17:28,002 --> 00:17:30,436
Elizabeth Blaine.

129
00:17:36,722 --> 00:17:40,715
You don't know who this investor is
or even if his money is real.

130
00:17:40,802 --> 00:17:44,397
l know. Lowell. l know.
Like l said. l just...

131
00:17:44,482 --> 00:17:47,997
l'm not condoning what you did.
Elizabeth. not for a second.

132
00:17:48,082 --> 00:17:51,836
but there's a right way
to do the wrong thing.

133
00:17:51,922 --> 00:17:56,677
That's all l'm saying.
We have to protect ourselves.

134
00:17:56,762 --> 00:17:58,753
OK. Then...

135
00:17:59,362 --> 00:18:00,875
all l can say is...

136
00:18:02,042 --> 00:18:03,919
is welcome aboard.

137
00:18:04,002 --> 00:18:07,711
Just listen.
Here's what l want you to do.

138
00:18:07,802 --> 00:18:11,033
Take the body
to my parents' old house.

139
00:18:11,122 --> 00:18:15,320
The place is a wreck
but it's empty and it's isolated.

140
00:18:15,402 --> 00:18:17,677
We can start testing it there.

141
00:18:17,762 --> 00:18:23,632
and find out what it really is before
we bring in your man with the money.

142
00:18:23,722 --> 00:18:26,111
- When will Lowell be here?
- About two hours.

143
00:18:26,202 --> 00:18:28,113
He and the guys
had to make a pick-up.

144
00:18:28,202 --> 00:18:31,239
- A pick-up of what?
- 350 pints of blood. give or take.

145
00:18:34,042 --> 00:18:36,158
l guess it pays to be connected.

146
00:18:36,242 --> 00:18:39,234
Lowell got the research grant
to put UNO on the map.

147
00:18:39,322 --> 00:18:45,238
- They'd probably have given us the blood.
- Sure. if we hadn't stolen it already.

148
00:18:45,322 --> 00:18:47,882
lsn't that right. Lowell?

149
00:18:47,962 --> 00:18:51,079
OK. lowlifes. that'll do.

150
00:18:51,162 --> 00:18:53,676
Clamp on.

151
00:18:53,762 --> 00:18:56,117
- Secure his hands and legs.
- Sure.

152
00:18:56,202 --> 00:18:59,080
Like he's gonna be going somewhere.

153
00:19:03,082 --> 00:19:04,879
He's good to go.

154
00:19:04,962 --> 00:19:06,953
Poor little asshole.

155
00:19:16,322 --> 00:19:20,713
March 1 0. First trial.
To infinity and beyond. sweetie.

156
00:19:21,682 --> 00:19:25,755
l don't know about this. guys.
l think l prefer the guy dead.

157
00:19:25,842 --> 00:19:28,914
My mom says it takes one person
to do something stupid.

158
00:19:29,002 --> 00:19:32,597
but it takes a whole bunch of people
to do something really stupid.

159
00:19:32,682 --> 00:19:35,321
Fuck it. Think about the money.

160
00:19:35,762 --> 00:19:37,753
Now...

161
00:19:38,882 --> 00:19:42,079
- let's immerse him.
- Enough talking. Let's dunk him.

162
00:19:42,162 --> 00:19:45,871
- All right. Come on. Luke.
- All right. Watch the cord.

163
00:19:45,962 --> 00:19:48,476
- Put that over there.
- Careful.

164
00:19:48,562 --> 00:19:50,757
- Easy.
- You got him?

165
00:19:55,442 --> 00:19:57,114
OK.

166
00:19:58,242 --> 00:19:59,880
OK.

167
00:19:59,962 --> 00:20:01,680
Ready?

168
00:20:02,722 --> 00:20:05,555
All right. Let it go. Let it go.

169
00:20:07,202 --> 00:20:09,921
All right. he's in.

170
00:20:17,002 --> 00:20:19,721
- All right. l'm hooked over here.
- OK.

171
00:20:19,802 --> 00:20:22,953
- All right. He's all locked in.
- What now?

172
00:20:23,042 --> 00:20:28,639
All right. guys. From here on out.
whatever happens happens.

173
00:20:37,082 --> 00:20:40,836
lt's been. like. two hours
and not even so much as a ripple.

174
00:20:40,922 --> 00:20:43,117
The dude is dead. man.

175
00:20:44,162 --> 00:20:46,551
Maybe we need virgin blood.

176
00:20:47,762 --> 00:20:50,640
Why?

177
00:20:50,722 --> 00:20:53,680
Didn't Elizabeth Báthory
always bathe in virgin blood?

178
00:20:53,762 --> 00:20:57,357
No. No. cos when my blood
touched its skin. it reacted.

179
00:20:57,442 --> 00:20:59,910
There goes the virgin theory.

180
00:21:02,402 --> 00:21:06,361
l was acing ethical problems
in modern medicine this semester.

181
00:21:06,442 --> 00:21:09,673
Come on. Do something.

182
00:21:09,762 --> 00:21:11,753
Anything.

183
00:21:19,322 --> 00:21:22,120
All right. All right.

184
00:21:22,202 --> 00:21:24,318
We fish him out. All right?

185
00:21:24,402 --> 00:21:27,758
See what happened. or didn't.

186
00:21:35,562 --> 00:21:37,757
l think we melted him.

187
00:21:39,402 --> 00:21:42,599
Somebody wanna tell me
what's going on up there?

188
00:21:42,682 --> 00:21:44,877
Nothing. This is just such a...

189
00:21:50,922 --> 00:21:52,275
Oh. God!

190
00:22:01,602 --> 00:22:03,194
Oh. God!

191
00:22:06,162 --> 00:22:07,561
Grab him!

192
00:22:38,802 --> 00:22:42,192
- Stake it!
- Get the blood off.

193
00:22:43,042 --> 00:22:44,839
Stake it!

194
00:22:47,402 --> 00:22:50,599
- Get the blood off!
- Stake it. Hurry!

195
00:22:55,442 --> 00:22:58,195
Staking it won't be necessary.

196
00:23:07,522 --> 00:23:10,036
lt's a sun gun.

197
00:23:11,242 --> 00:23:16,316
- Who the fuck are you?
- l'm the money. But you can call me Eric.

198
00:23:44,002 --> 00:23:46,072
We're so screwed.

199
00:23:46,162 --> 00:23:48,676
We have to call the police.

200
00:23:48,762 --> 00:23:51,230
Are you kidding?
How are we gonna explain this?

201
00:23:51,322 --> 00:23:56,077
- We can't just leave her here.
- Kenny's right. No police.

202
00:23:56,162 --> 00:23:59,552
What? lt's over. Lowell.

203
00:23:59,642 --> 00:24:03,032
You understand? lt's over.

204
00:24:03,122 --> 00:24:09,231
l don't know what the hell happened
up there. l don't even wanna think about it.

205
00:24:09,322 --> 00:24:12,712
But Tanya's dead.
We have to deal with that.

206
00:24:12,802 --> 00:24:14,872
All of us.

207
00:24:14,962 --> 00:24:18,637
Elizabeth. we can't help Tanya.

208
00:24:18,722 --> 00:24:21,156
Not now.

209
00:24:21,242 --> 00:24:23,472
Think about what we saw.

210
00:24:23,562 --> 00:24:26,201
what we learned.
what we can still learn.

211
00:24:26,282 --> 00:24:29,354
Am l supposed to be
comforted by that?

212
00:24:31,962 --> 00:24:35,352
My God. What is happening here?

213
00:24:38,082 --> 00:24:40,915
Forget it. We have to call it in.

214
00:24:41,002 --> 00:24:43,357
There's no other way.

215
00:24:43,442 --> 00:24:45,034
Luke?

216
00:24:50,042 --> 00:24:51,839
Luke.

217
00:24:55,842 --> 00:24:57,639
l don't believe it.

218
00:24:57,722 --> 00:25:00,998
l think what they're trying
to say. Elizabeth.

219
00:25:01,082 --> 00:25:05,155
is that we've all just crossed the Rubicon.
There is no going back.

220
00:25:05,242 --> 00:25:07,836
Forget the fuckin' Rubicon.
What about our money?

221
00:25:07,922 --> 00:25:11,551
First. l only represent the money.

222
00:25:11,642 --> 00:25:14,520
and second. it seems
l'm the only one around here

223
00:25:14,602 --> 00:25:17,275
who's been acting in good faith.

224
00:25:17,362 --> 00:25:20,559
So l propose we all start
working together on the off chance

225
00:25:20,642 --> 00:25:25,238
that some good
can still come out of this nightmare.

226
00:25:26,642 --> 00:25:31,432
Good. l believe there's usually
a shovel in the barn.

227
00:26:40,562 --> 00:26:42,757
l'm so sorry. Tanya.

228
00:26:47,642 --> 00:26:50,440
l'm so sorry.

229
00:26:53,762 --> 00:26:56,322
Stake it! Stake it! Hurry!

230
00:26:57,882 --> 00:27:02,000
lncredible.
The electronics don't record him at all.

231
00:27:02,082 --> 00:27:06,280
Of course he doesn't show up
on a video monitor. He's a fucking vampire.

232
00:27:06,362 --> 00:27:09,195
- Where is she?
- Your girlfriend?

233
00:27:09,282 --> 00:27:12,911
- lt's a sun gun.
- His girlfriend.

234
00:27:13,002 --> 00:27:18,122
- Who the fuck are you?
- l'm the money. But you can call me Eric.

235
00:27:26,842 --> 00:27:30,994
lt's all been arranged. We'll move
the subject to a more secure location.

236
00:27:31,082 --> 00:27:33,960
begin testing it for real.

237
00:27:34,042 --> 00:27:36,556
How much more real
does it have to get?

238
00:27:36,642 --> 00:27:38,837
We know he's alive. Kenny.

239
00:27:38,922 --> 00:27:41,675
We just don't know
what's keeping him alive.

240
00:27:41,762 --> 00:27:44,640
Or if that essence can be transferred
to somebody else.

241
00:27:44,722 --> 00:27:48,271
l just got through planting my best friend
in somebody's back yard.

242
00:27:48,362 --> 00:27:50,512
Excuse me if l don't give a shit.

243
00:27:50,602 --> 00:27:54,561
Unless this essence can bring her back.
l'm just here to get my money.

244
00:27:54,642 --> 00:27:58,396
Tanya's dead. lt doesn't work on cells
that are already dead.

245
00:27:58,482 --> 00:27:59,756
No?

246
00:27:59,842 --> 00:28:02,037
Well. how does it work. Lowell?

247
00:28:02,122 --> 00:28:04,477
Does it work on diseased cells?

248
00:28:04,562 --> 00:28:09,113
Would it work on that? Cells from some
palsied piece of shit in a wheelchair who...

249
00:28:09,202 --> 00:28:13,400
- Oh. my God. that's you!
- You're missing the big picture.

250
00:28:13,482 --> 00:28:20,081
Sure. You won't just be sitting there with
your Nobel prize. you'll be dancing with it.

251
00:28:25,922 --> 00:28:29,073
l suggest keeping your students in line.
Professor.

252
00:28:29,162 --> 00:28:34,111
- This won't go well for any of us.
- Thank you for the advice.

253
00:28:35,522 --> 00:28:38,400
lron chains painted with liquid silver.

254
00:28:38,482 --> 00:28:41,315
ln his weakened state.
they should hold him easily.

255
00:28:41,402 --> 00:28:43,597
Weakened state. my ass.

256
00:28:48,802 --> 00:28:53,478
lf you ask me. he's looking better.
even without our help.

257
00:28:55,122 --> 00:28:57,238
Ultraviolet light.

258
00:28:57,322 --> 00:29:00,871
He gets out of line. you dial this up.

259
00:29:06,642 --> 00:29:08,280
Turn it down.

260
00:29:10,242 --> 00:29:12,119
Turn it back down!

261
00:29:25,682 --> 00:29:30,517
Any of you come down here.
wear your shades or you'll fry your retinas.

262
00:29:30,602 --> 00:29:34,959
Oh. and be sure to keep
the generator fuelled at all times.

263
00:29:35,042 --> 00:29:39,911
You should all get familiar with these.
in case you need to use them.

264
00:29:40,002 --> 00:29:43,472
Spear guns.
The harpoons have been plated with silver.

265
00:29:43,562 --> 00:29:48,192
so please. don't bang them around.
or it'll flake off.

266
00:29:48,282 --> 00:29:52,594
Shooting him through the heart
will certainly slow him down.

267
00:29:52,682 --> 00:29:56,516
Now. here's a testament
to Ockham's razor.

268
00:30:55,722 --> 00:30:57,872
Elizabeth?

269
00:31:03,642 --> 00:31:08,272
- You OK? Elizabeth!
- l'm fine. l'll be out in a minute.

270
00:31:08,362 --> 00:31:10,159
OK.

271
00:31:13,242 --> 00:31:16,518
Why do we get stuck
with all the disturbing-the-peace calls?

272
00:31:16,602 --> 00:31:19,036
Some chick screaming
her head off all night.

273
00:31:19,122 --> 00:31:22,432
Come on. man. l call that a party.

274
00:31:27,202 --> 00:31:32,834
l'm telling you. Hodge. Fletcher would have
you running here every time his dog barks.

275
00:31:32,922 --> 00:31:36,801
That's not all.
Last night Fletch calls up St Jude's.

276
00:31:36,882 --> 00:31:41,000
Tells Father Harry there's some kind of
demonic ritual going on out here.

277
00:31:41,082 --> 00:31:45,997
like he expects Harry to send out
his favourite exorcist or something.

278
00:31:46,082 --> 00:31:48,232
l'd pay to see that.

279
00:32:05,362 --> 00:32:07,353
Hello?

280
00:32:25,202 --> 00:32:27,193
Holy Christ.

281
00:33:10,562 --> 00:33:13,235
Police. Get up.

282
00:33:14,122 --> 00:33:16,113
Slowly.

283
00:33:17,482 --> 00:33:19,473
Now turn around.

284
00:33:24,602 --> 00:33:26,957
You an exorcist?

285
00:33:27,642 --> 00:33:30,554
Not exactly.

286
00:33:30,642 --> 00:33:34,476
Put your hands on your head
and turn back around slow.

287
00:33:34,562 --> 00:33:41,035
There's no need for that. officer. l'm done
here. l'll leave you to your crime scene.

288
00:33:41,122 --> 00:33:44,273
Jesus. What the hell happened here?

289
00:33:44,362 --> 00:33:45,477
Jimmy!

290
00:33:45,562 --> 00:33:47,951
Jimmy. get up here! Now!

291
00:33:53,762 --> 00:33:57,516
lt's best if everyone stays calm.

292
00:33:57,602 --> 00:33:59,558
You answer me. man.

293
00:33:59,642 --> 00:34:01,792
What the hell are you doing here?

294
00:34:04,882 --> 00:34:06,998
Friends forever?

295
00:34:16,322 --> 00:34:19,598
When we were in the tub.
he must have bit me.

296
00:34:26,962 --> 00:34:28,998
How sick is that?

297
00:34:57,642 --> 00:35:00,110
Your lucky day.

298
00:35:02,762 --> 00:35:06,471
Close your eyes. officer.
and count your blessings.

299
00:35:06,562 --> 00:35:09,474
When you open them.
this will all be over.

300
00:35:27,962 --> 00:35:33,082
This is a scraping of skin from our subject
before we immersed it in the tub.

301
00:35:33,162 --> 00:35:36,950
and this blood is from Kenny.

302
00:35:40,042 --> 00:35:42,192
Regular unleaded.

303
00:35:44,802 --> 00:35:46,918
Look at the replication.

304
00:35:47,002 --> 00:35:49,562
lt's just like...

305
00:35:49,642 --> 00:35:51,872
cancer.

306
00:35:51,962 --> 00:35:54,999
- but without the chaos.
- Amazing.

307
00:35:55,082 --> 00:35:57,915
- That's not the question.
- We're getting to that.

308
00:35:58,002 --> 00:36:02,154
- Not fast enough.
- Are you OK?

309
00:36:02,242 --> 00:36:05,359
l just wanna get the answer we came for
and get this over with.

310
00:36:05,442 --> 00:36:08,798
We're here to see what its blood can do.
so let's get on with it.

311
00:36:08,882 --> 00:36:11,032
OK.

312
00:36:11,122 --> 00:36:15,957
We'll need to draw at least 25cc
of our new friend's blood for starters.

313
00:36:16,042 --> 00:36:17,873
Any volunteers?

314
00:36:37,962 --> 00:36:40,157
Who's your daddy?

315
00:36:47,122 --> 00:36:49,113
Where's Luke?

316
00:36:51,322 --> 00:36:53,313
Good question.

317
00:37:07,602 --> 00:37:09,672
Don't ask.

318
00:37:35,322 --> 00:37:38,712
You are not like them.

319
00:37:51,402 --> 00:37:53,597
Take from me.

320
00:37:53,682 --> 00:37:56,515
but first...

321
00:37:57,122 --> 00:38:00,080
you must stop...

322
00:38:00,162 --> 00:38:02,073
the sun.

323
00:38:03,122 --> 00:38:06,956
- Dial down the lights. All the way.
- Fuck that.

324
00:38:07,042 --> 00:38:11,752
lf you want the blood.
then dial down the lights.

325
00:38:14,762 --> 00:38:16,753
Bloody Americans.

326
00:38:41,682 --> 00:38:43,673
Neck.

327
00:39:21,322 --> 00:39:24,314
Everything you know...

328
00:39:26,562 --> 00:39:30,157
is about to end.

329
00:39:49,322 --> 00:39:54,919
You can see from these samples how
my muscle fibre has deteriorated over time.

330
00:39:55,002 --> 00:39:56,993
You'll have to admit.

331
00:39:57,082 --> 00:40:00,677
l'm pretty much
the poster boy for cellular degeneration.

332
00:40:00,762 --> 00:40:04,357
We all gotta be good at something.
Right. Lowell?

333
00:40:04,442 --> 00:40:08,151
That's right. Kenny.
Do the honours.

334
00:40:08,882 --> 00:40:12,795
Now let's see
what the vampire blood does.

335
00:40:17,362 --> 00:40:19,830
That doesn't look good.

336
00:40:19,922 --> 00:40:23,039
- lt's killing off the host cells.
- Wait.

337
00:40:28,122 --> 00:40:29,919
What's going on?

338
00:40:32,642 --> 00:40:34,473
They're taking over.

339
00:40:34,562 --> 00:40:38,555
lf it's replacing the cells it's killed.
when do you stop being you?

340
00:40:38,642 --> 00:40:41,156
lt won't change who you are.
just make you better.

341
00:40:41,242 --> 00:40:44,917
- lt'd turn you into fucking Superman!
- Or pure refried evil.

342
00:40:45,002 --> 00:40:48,199
- Where have you been. Luke?
- Shopping.

343
00:40:48,282 --> 00:40:51,399
You know. evil's just a state of mind. fella.
that's all.

344
00:40:51,482 --> 00:40:54,792
He's right. you know.
lt's just a subjective term.

345
00:40:54,882 --> 00:40:57,271
Meaningless in a clinical setting.

346
00:40:57,362 --> 00:41:00,240
ls it? ls this the new you. Lowell?

347
00:41:01,282 --> 00:41:03,955
Here's the new you on holy water.

348
00:41:15,122 --> 00:41:18,239
lt's fucking acid.
You threw fucking acid on it!

349
00:41:22,242 --> 00:41:24,392
So what are you saying?

350
00:41:24,482 --> 00:41:27,758
What l'm saying is that
that thing out in the pool is a monster.

351
00:41:27,842 --> 00:41:29,753
l know better than you cos l stole it.

352
00:41:29,842 --> 00:41:32,754
Don't pretend it's something else.
We all know what it is.

353
00:41:32,842 --> 00:41:36,357
No. what are you really saying?
Are you with us or against us?

354
00:41:36,442 --> 00:41:38,637
l gotta know who my allies are.

355
00:41:38,722 --> 00:41:41,794
- Answer me when l talk to you!
- That's enough.

356
00:41:42,562 --> 00:41:46,999
Now. you listen to me.
We are all in this together. right?

357
00:41:47,082 --> 00:41:51,473
Nobody's backing out here.
so let's just take it down a notch.

358
00:41:51,562 --> 00:41:53,393
OK?

359
00:41:53,482 --> 00:41:56,474
- OK?
- OK.

360
00:41:57,242 --> 00:42:01,918
We all know it's a vampire.
Nobody's kidding themselves here.

361
00:42:02,002 --> 00:42:08,237
The trick is to separate the disease vector -
the evil. if you will - from the cure.

362
00:42:08,322 --> 00:42:10,756
Right. Like a vaccine.

363
00:42:10,842 --> 00:42:15,711
Where you take what makes you sick
and you turn it into a cure.

364
00:42:15,802 --> 00:42:19,317
For lack of a better term. yes.
Get my point. Luke?

365
00:42:19,402 --> 00:42:21,393
Yeah. Lowell.

366
00:42:22,642 --> 00:42:25,315
l get your point.

367
00:42:28,842 --> 00:42:32,039
That dude is a major-league liability.

368
00:42:46,602 --> 00:42:49,992
- Why the seeds?
- Vampires are compulsive counters.

369
00:42:50,082 --> 00:42:54,155
He'll want to stop and count every one
before moving on.

370
00:42:55,162 --> 00:42:57,915
And the net?

371
00:42:58,002 --> 00:43:00,391
They can't pass any knot
without untying it.

372
00:43:00,482 --> 00:43:02,757
Where do you get this stuff?

373
00:43:08,002 --> 00:43:11,153
- Basic cultural literacy.
- Hey. Luke.

374
00:43:12,122 --> 00:43:14,397
l know how you feel.

375
00:43:14,482 --> 00:43:18,475
All l'm asking is you give them a chance
to see if any good can come out of this.

376
00:43:18,562 --> 00:43:22,919
Elizabeth. let's just call this for what it is.
OK? This is all about Lowell.

377
00:43:23,002 --> 00:43:25,118
Yeah. it is.

378
00:43:25,202 --> 00:43:29,241
l'm sorry. l've been watching
the only man l ever loved

379
00:43:29,322 --> 00:43:32,234
die inch by inch
over the last three years.

380
00:43:32,322 --> 00:43:34,882
- Three years!
- l know that. but that's not...

381
00:43:34,962 --> 00:43:36,839
No. no.

382
00:43:36,922 --> 00:43:40,835
Lowell is everything to me.

383
00:43:40,922 --> 00:43:42,799
You understand? Everything.

384
00:43:42,882 --> 00:43:45,954
Do you know why
l took that job down at the morgue?

385
00:43:46,042 --> 00:43:49,114
- No. Tell me.
- Lowell made me do it.

386
00:43:49,202 --> 00:43:55,118
Yeah. He said that l didn't believe in death.
couldn't handle it. didn't think it was real.

387
00:43:55,202 --> 00:43:58,000
l still can't handle it. Luke.

388
00:43:59,842 --> 00:44:04,757
We lost Tanya.
Please don't make me lose Lowell as well.

389
00:44:33,722 --> 00:44:35,519
Can l help you. Father?

390
00:44:35,602 --> 00:44:38,912
My name is Uffizi.
l come at the behest of Father Périgord.

391
00:44:39,002 --> 00:44:42,278
- Who is it. Paul?
- Father Uffizi.

392
00:44:42,362 --> 00:44:46,196
- Father Périgord sent him.
- What brings you here?

393
00:44:46,282 --> 00:44:50,241
l understand a man
was seen stealing holy water.

394
00:44:51,242 --> 00:44:55,474
- How do you know that?
- You mentioned it to Father Périgord.

395
00:44:56,482 --> 00:44:58,518
l'd like to talk to the boy who saw him.

396
00:44:58,602 --> 00:45:02,117
He has basketball practice till five.

397
00:45:02,202 --> 00:45:04,193
l'll wait.

398
00:45:05,122 --> 00:45:06,999
- l don't want trouble.
- Excuse me?

399
00:45:07,082 --> 00:45:10,392
l've heard the stories. Valestrama. Tibet.

400
00:45:11,402 --> 00:45:16,237
lf what they say is true. then
you have committed unspeakable acts.

401
00:45:16,322 --> 00:45:18,961
Then God will judge me.

402
00:45:19,042 --> 00:45:20,521
Not you.

403
00:45:31,482 --> 00:45:36,510
Show him downstairs.
And see to whatever else he needs.

404
00:45:39,842 --> 00:45:42,515
- Luke.
- Bad time. Lowell.

405
00:45:42,602 --> 00:45:45,480
- l need you to understand...
- l need you to understand.

406
00:45:45,562 --> 00:45:47,439
She's too good for you.

407
00:45:47,522 --> 00:45:49,433
Maybe. Maybe you're right.

408
00:45:49,522 --> 00:45:52,480
- But don't forget one thing.
- What's that?

409
00:45:52,562 --> 00:45:57,590
Despite my obvious limitations.
she chose me. not you.

410
00:45:57,682 --> 00:45:59,513
So l suggest you get over it.

411
00:46:15,522 --> 00:46:19,310
Once again.
he's free in the world.

412
00:46:19,402 --> 00:46:22,519
l'll do what l must. Your Eminence.
As always.

413
00:46:22,602 --> 00:46:26,561
He's not like the others. you know.
He was the first.

414
00:46:26,642 --> 00:46:28,633
The betrayer.

415
00:46:28,722 --> 00:46:32,032
An immortal being. cursed by God.

416
00:46:32,122 --> 00:46:34,716
His face may change
with each regeneration.

417
00:46:34,802 --> 00:46:36,838
but the evil within him is constant.

418
00:46:36,922 --> 00:46:41,598
Any harm you do to his body
will be meaningless - meaningless -

419
00:46:41,682 --> 00:46:44,992
unless you can set his soul free.

420
00:46:45,562 --> 00:46:49,840
- He is not deserving.
- All men are deserving. All men.

421
00:46:49,922 --> 00:46:53,881
We are not just
the instruments of God's vengeance.

422
00:46:53,962 --> 00:46:56,601
Even you.

423
00:46:56,682 --> 00:46:57,876
Yes. Your Eminence.

424
00:46:57,962 --> 00:47:01,352
You must grant him absolution.

425
00:47:01,442 --> 00:47:06,436
Only forgiveness can end his damnation.
and allow him to die.

426
00:47:08,002 --> 00:47:10,914
Remember. Christ forgave.

427
00:47:11,802 --> 00:47:15,033
And. in the end. so must we all.

428
00:48:03,162 --> 00:48:07,553
Elizabeth.
''Oath of God'' in Hebrew.

429
00:48:09,082 --> 00:48:11,073
is it not?

430
00:48:15,042 --> 00:48:17,681
The noble caretaker of the dead.

431
00:48:17,762 --> 00:48:22,916
giving names to the nameless.
comfort to the damned.

432
00:48:24,922 --> 00:48:29,712
And now. taker of blood.

433
00:48:29,802 --> 00:48:32,600
What's wrong. bloodsucker?

434
00:48:32,682 --> 00:48:36,152
Did you think my blood
would be limitless?

435
00:48:38,282 --> 00:48:41,752
Better that you protect
what you already have

436
00:48:41,842 --> 00:48:44,640
than seek more where there is none.

437
00:48:53,762 --> 00:48:56,151
Oh. yeah.

438
00:48:56,242 --> 00:48:58,278
This is it.

439
00:49:07,922 --> 00:49:11,995
- Kenny?
- l'm sorry. Professor.

440
00:49:14,362 --> 00:49:16,353
Couldn't wait.

441
00:49:20,842 --> 00:49:24,118
Hope this won't affect my grade.

442
00:49:26,002 --> 00:49:28,391
l was flunking anyway.

443
00:49:31,482 --> 00:49:33,996
That's OK. Really.

444
00:49:34,082 --> 00:49:39,110
l've got this whole new take on medicine.
Very Darwinian.

445
00:49:39,642 --> 00:49:42,600
lt's called survival of the...

446
00:49:43,602 --> 00:49:45,877
- What is that word?
- Kenny...

447
00:49:45,962 --> 00:49:47,793
No. no.

448
00:49:47,882 --> 00:49:50,715
Don't tell me. l've got it right here.

449
00:49:50,802 --> 00:49:53,680
On the tip of my tongue.

450
00:49:53,762 --> 00:49:56,515
- lt's...
- Lowell?

451
00:49:58,562 --> 00:50:01,395
Better get back to your honey.

452
00:50:06,082 --> 00:50:08,073
Kenny? Lowell?

453
00:50:08,162 --> 00:50:11,154
- Where's Lowell...
- What's going on?

454
00:50:11,242 --> 00:50:15,235
What do you think?
Kenny took off with the last blood sample.

455
00:50:16,522 --> 00:50:18,592
Don't look at me!

456
00:50:18,682 --> 00:50:21,037
There's more where that came from.

457
00:50:21,122 --> 00:50:23,590
- The vampire's dry.
- Tell me there's more!

458
00:50:23,682 --> 00:50:27,072
- The blood we had just ran out that door.
- Hey. asshole!

459
00:50:27,162 --> 00:50:29,437
Stand back. you fucking Yank.

460
00:50:30,562 --> 00:50:32,359
Better keep that thing close by.

461
00:50:32,442 --> 00:50:35,240
- Help me.
- Are you all right. honey?

462
00:50:59,122 --> 00:51:01,352
Up. up and away.

463
00:51:07,642 --> 00:51:11,920
- What are you doing?
- Protecting our investment.

464
00:52:40,882 --> 00:52:43,350
Nice.

465
00:53:19,282 --> 00:53:22,433
Almost makes you dizzy. doesn't it?

466
00:53:26,482 --> 00:53:28,916
Lowell? Oh. God. Lowell!

467
00:53:29,002 --> 00:53:30,993
Lowell! You OK?

468
00:53:35,922 --> 00:53:37,640
Jesus...

469
00:53:39,322 --> 00:53:41,119
Lowell...

470
00:53:41,202 --> 00:53:43,193
Oh. God...

471
00:53:49,562 --> 00:53:51,996
This is my fault.

472
00:53:52,082 --> 00:53:54,471
l made this happen.

473
00:54:06,842 --> 00:54:10,676
There's a pulse.
lt's weak. but it's there.

474
00:54:10,762 --> 00:54:14,994
Luke. help me.
Help me get him into the locker room.

475
00:55:04,162 --> 00:55:06,153
What the fuck...?

476
00:55:17,122 --> 00:55:19,238
Get the fuck down!

477
00:55:19,322 --> 00:55:22,280
No! No! No!

478
00:55:22,362 --> 00:55:24,956
Come here. You know what l got?

479
00:55:25,042 --> 00:55:27,033
- l got hooya power.
- Kenny. wait.

480
00:55:27,122 --> 00:55:29,317
Shut the fuck up.

481
00:55:29,962 --> 00:55:32,476
You little prick.
you were gonna spoil my party.

482
00:55:32,562 --> 00:55:34,473
No. no. no.

483
00:55:35,122 --> 00:55:38,159
What have we got here?

484
00:55:43,802 --> 00:55:47,317
You here to give me a whipping. Dad?
Have l been that bad?

485
00:55:57,002 --> 00:56:00,074
- l'm not what you think.
- You're exactly what l think.

486
00:56:00,162 --> 00:56:04,075
You want my soul. Father?
Do you want my soul? ls that it?

487
00:56:04,162 --> 00:56:07,552
No. God gets your soul.
l just want your head.

488
00:56:11,322 --> 00:56:14,041
Oh. God. No. please.

489
00:56:34,402 --> 00:56:37,439
- Where is it?
- What?

490
00:56:37,922 --> 00:56:40,800
Play games. you die.

491
00:56:40,882 --> 00:56:45,398
l don't know
what you're talking about.

492
00:56:48,682 --> 00:56:50,638
Where's the body?

493
00:56:53,962 --> 00:56:56,317
Not far. Not far.

494
00:56:56,402 --> 00:56:58,313
Six or seven blocks east.

495
00:56:58,402 --> 00:57:00,632
Old swimming pool.

496
00:57:16,842 --> 00:57:19,072
- Tell them l'm coming.
- Yes.

497
00:57:20,082 --> 00:57:22,676
Yes. l will.

498
00:57:40,642 --> 00:57:42,951
l thought you said
that thing was bled dry.

499
00:57:43,042 --> 00:57:45,602
l'm not taking blood. Luke. l'm giving it.

500
00:57:45,682 --> 00:57:47,354
What?

501
00:57:47,442 --> 00:57:49,433
- Why?
- lt needs to replenish.

502
00:57:49,522 --> 00:57:54,073
Oh. no. l know what you're thinking.
There's nothing you can do for Lowell now.

503
00:57:54,162 --> 00:57:57,040
- l have to try.
- What if you get infected?

504
00:57:57,122 --> 00:58:00,671
lt's a little late for that. don't you think?

505
00:58:00,762 --> 00:58:02,912
Jesus. When?

506
00:58:03,002 --> 00:58:05,641
Back in the morgue.
l cut my finger on its tooth.

507
00:58:05,722 --> 00:58:08,714
- You mean this whole time you...?
- l haven't turned.

508
00:58:08,802 --> 00:58:13,637
Not yet. as far as l can tell. Look. look.
My body's fighting the infection.

509
00:58:13,722 --> 00:58:17,556
Luke. if we save Lowell
he can find a cure and save us both.

510
00:58:17,642 --> 00:58:20,281
You have to help. Luke.

511
00:58:23,922 --> 00:58:25,514
Jesus.

512
00:58:43,362 --> 00:58:46,274
Stay away!

513
00:58:49,722 --> 00:58:52,634
- Get back!
- l'm only here to help you.

514
00:58:52,722 --> 00:58:55,236
l killed my own cat.

515
00:58:55,322 --> 00:58:57,961
How could l do that? How?

516
00:58:58,042 --> 00:58:59,521
What's wrong with me?

517
00:59:09,842 --> 00:59:11,878
lf that thing
so much as twitches.

518
00:59:11,962 --> 00:59:15,671
l'm frying the bastard and
pulling you off the line. You understand?

519
00:59:37,842 --> 00:59:41,118
You sure about this? lt's not too late.

520
00:59:42,242 --> 00:59:44,233
Yeah.

521
01:00:07,442 --> 01:00:09,398
Elizabeth?

522
01:00:09,922 --> 01:00:14,950
We are the only truth. Elizabeth.
There is no other.

523
01:00:15,042 --> 01:00:16,873
Elizabeth?

524
01:00:48,442 --> 01:00:51,400
- Who are you?
- Who am l?

525
01:00:51,482 --> 01:00:56,033
Gilles de Rais... Vlad Tepes... El Hazarid...

526
01:00:57,202 --> 01:01:02,754
Dagobert... Proximus... Uther... Caligula...

527
01:01:05,322 --> 01:01:07,711
lscariot.

528
01:01:08,642 --> 01:01:12,351
And so many more that l've long forgotten.

529
01:01:14,442 --> 01:01:15,511
Elizabeth!

530
01:01:35,042 --> 01:01:37,112
- Are you all right?
- l don't know.

531
01:01:59,722 --> 01:02:02,873
- What happened? Where's Kenny?
- Dead. Very dead.

532
01:02:02,962 --> 01:02:05,192
- You killed him?
- Yes.

533
01:02:05,282 --> 01:02:07,637
No. No. somebody beat me to it.

534
01:02:07,722 --> 01:02:10,759
And that same son of a bitch
is coming for us.

535
01:02:10,842 --> 01:02:14,551
- Just one guy?
- One guy. One guy?

536
01:02:14,642 --> 01:02:16,280
- Yeah!
- Yes. one guy!

537
01:02:16,362 --> 01:02:20,037
And here's the kicker.
He's a bloody priest.

538
01:02:20,122 --> 01:02:22,920
- Priest?
- Priest from hell.

539
01:02:23,002 --> 01:02:25,232
Whipped Kenny's head clean off.

540
01:02:26,562 --> 01:02:29,634
lt's the guy from the morgue.
Elizabeth. Elizabeth!

541
01:02:29,722 --> 01:02:31,917
Where's Lowell?

542
01:02:33,282 --> 01:02:36,080
- He got hurt.
- How bad?

543
01:02:37,842 --> 01:02:39,480
Bad.

544
01:02:40,002 --> 01:02:43,312
Where is he?
Where is he?

545
01:02:51,482 --> 01:02:53,632
- No!
- Stay back.

546
01:02:56,482 --> 01:02:58,473
Eric. come on.

547
01:03:03,122 --> 01:03:05,477
- That fuck's...
- Listen.

548
01:03:05,562 --> 01:03:09,714
lt is down to you and me. man.
OK? We can't go losing it now.

549
01:03:09,802 --> 01:03:12,521
You said he's coming.
How long until he gets here?

550
01:03:12,602 --> 01:03:17,357
l don't know. l don't know. He went
to deal with some bird that Kenny...

551
01:03:17,442 --> 01:03:20,434
Ten minutes. maybe less.

552
01:03:33,722 --> 01:03:36,919
Lowell?
Come back to me. please.

553
01:03:48,522 --> 01:03:50,672
Lowell.

554
01:03:50,762 --> 01:03:54,437
- Lizzie?
- Yeah. it's me. l'm here. l'm here.

555
01:03:56,522 --> 01:04:00,435
- Help me up.
- OK. take it easy. OK? Take it slow.

556
01:04:00,522 --> 01:04:02,160
OK?

557
01:04:02,242 --> 01:04:05,120
OK. All right. OK.

558
01:04:05,202 --> 01:04:07,796
Hold on.
Can you hold onto my shoulders?

559
01:04:07,882 --> 01:04:10,794
OK. You ready? You ready?

560
01:04:10,882 --> 01:04:13,271
Up.

561
01:04:13,362 --> 01:04:16,035
You're OK. Come on. Hold on. Steady.

562
01:04:16,122 --> 01:04:18,238
OK. OK.

563
01:04:20,362 --> 01:04:22,353
Are you all right?

564
01:04:23,682 --> 01:04:25,195
What's it like?

565
01:04:25,282 --> 01:04:27,000
What's it like?

566
01:04:27,082 --> 01:04:29,073
lt's like...

567
01:04:31,162 --> 01:04:32,641
sex.

568
01:04:42,322 --> 01:04:44,119
Oh. yeah.

569
01:04:47,522 --> 01:04:49,513
Yeah.

570
01:04:49,602 --> 01:04:51,433
OK.

571
01:04:51,522 --> 01:04:53,672
OK. lemme go.

572
01:04:54,602 --> 01:04:56,672
- You sure?
- Yeah. let me go.

573
01:05:06,082 --> 01:05:08,676
- Yeah.
- Welcome back.

574
01:05:14,602 --> 01:05:17,275
Sorry. lt's...

575
01:05:18,082 --> 01:05:22,758
not that l don't appreciate
everything you've done for me. Lizzie.

576
01:05:22,842 --> 01:05:24,594
l really. really do.

577
01:05:24,682 --> 01:05:29,278
lt's just that. well.
we've reached the end of the line.

578
01:05:29,362 --> 01:05:31,512
l don't understand. l thought...

579
01:05:31,602 --> 01:05:33,877
You thought what?

580
01:05:33,962 --> 01:05:37,113
That we were in love?

581
01:05:37,202 --> 01:05:40,353
No. no. You were in love.

582
01:05:40,442 --> 01:05:42,353
l was in need.

583
01:05:46,122 --> 01:05:47,874
l don't believe you.

584
01:05:51,682 --> 01:05:55,436
You don't believe me?
Let me paint a little picture for you. Lizzie.

585
01:05:55,522 --> 01:05:59,879
Your investor?
The mystery man with the money?

586
01:05:59,962 --> 01:06:04,478
The one who called Luke in the morgue.
put this whole crazy thing together?

587
01:06:04,562 --> 01:06:06,757
You were sleeping with him.

588
01:06:07,722 --> 01:06:10,031
- No.
- That's right. Twisted limbs and all.

589
01:06:10,122 --> 01:06:12,511
Love hurts. bitch.

590
01:06:12,602 --> 01:06:14,160
Yeah.

591
01:06:16,042 --> 01:06:20,513
Eric's an old pal from college.
And he's quite the handyman.

592
01:06:20,602 --> 01:06:26,438
Unfortunately.
like myself. he's flat-out broke.

593
01:06:27,282 --> 01:06:29,716
But not for long.

594
01:06:30,762 --> 01:06:36,598
1 5 years ago. l was a struggling
medical student. just like you.

595
01:06:36,682 --> 01:06:39,879
And l worked in a morgue. just like you.

596
01:06:39,962 --> 01:06:43,272
And then one day it happened.
Something l couldn't explain.

597
01:06:43,362 --> 01:06:46,957
A vampire. a revenant being.

598
01:06:47,762 --> 01:06:50,435
showed up on my slab.

599
01:06:50,522 --> 01:06:52,956
And before l even had time
to think about it.

600
01:06:53,042 --> 01:06:56,273
this old priest comes.
and he claims the body.

601
01:06:56,362 --> 01:06:58,512
Then he asks me if anyone's examined it.

602
01:06:58,602 --> 01:07:01,355
And l can see in his eyes:
if l say yes.

603
01:07:01,442 --> 01:07:03,433
l'm dead.

604
01:07:06,762 --> 01:07:09,560
And then the implications hit me.

605
01:07:09,642 --> 01:07:12,361
The possibilities. The power!

606
01:07:12,442 --> 01:07:17,197
And so l went across the country
working at morgue after morgue.

607
01:07:17,282 --> 01:07:19,079
hoping that l'd find another one.

608
01:07:19,162 --> 01:07:21,801
And then. my body began to fail.

609
01:07:21,882 --> 01:07:25,238
And l needed eyes and ears.

610
01:07:25,322 --> 01:07:28,473
Someone to help me do
the things that l couldn't.

611
01:07:28,562 --> 01:07:32,396
Did you think you were the first one?

612
01:07:33,242 --> 01:07:34,880
You were the fifth.

613
01:07:34,962 --> 01:07:38,796
Just another watchdog.
But you were the first one to bark.

614
01:07:38,882 --> 01:07:41,396
- You deserve to die.
- l almost did.

615
01:07:41,482 --> 01:07:46,920
But l don't want you to think
that l'm not eternally grateful

616
01:07:47,002 --> 01:07:49,516
for everything you've done.

617
01:07:49,602 --> 01:07:51,593
We have to go now.

618
01:07:55,322 --> 01:07:57,313
Last one. guv.

619
01:08:12,122 --> 01:08:15,831
- That was a real jilted-bitch thing to do.
- No.

620
01:08:15,922 --> 01:08:18,197
This is a jilted-bitch thing to do.

621
01:08:23,442 --> 01:08:25,797
Lowell?

622
01:08:38,922 --> 01:08:41,880
Picked a bad day to become a vampire.

623
01:08:41,962 --> 01:08:44,601
- What do you want?
- Step outside.

624
01:08:44,682 --> 01:08:46,559
Step into the cleansing light.

625
01:08:47,402 --> 01:08:51,361
What's it gonna be. Eric?
Go for the blood. or go after Lowell?

626
01:08:51,442 --> 01:08:52,431
Bollocks!

627
01:08:52,522 --> 01:08:55,480
Back up. Back up.

628
01:09:01,722 --> 01:09:04,441
Wash away all that is unclean.

629
01:09:06,322 --> 01:09:08,961
Come closer.

630
01:09:36,162 --> 01:09:38,960
Go ahead. l'll still live forever.

631
01:09:39,042 --> 01:09:40,953
But will you want to?

632
01:09:46,882 --> 01:09:48,520
Holy shit!

633
01:09:53,362 --> 01:09:55,478
- Fuck!
- Luke. get it.

634
01:09:58,002 --> 01:09:59,560
He has to untie the knots.

635
01:10:02,922 --> 01:10:07,791
- The seeds!
- 47. 81 2.

636
01:10:07,882 --> 01:10:09,838
Oh. shit.

637
01:10:12,442 --> 01:10:14,637
Count this.

638
01:10:15,642 --> 01:10:20,113
7 37. 898.

639
01:10:22,482 --> 01:10:24,598
99.

640
01:10:24,682 --> 01:10:26,513
Oh. shit.

641
01:10:30,442 --> 01:10:32,239
Oh. my God!

642
01:11:00,202 --> 01:11:02,318
Shit!

643
01:11:04,522 --> 01:11:07,082
What do we have here? A priest?

644
01:11:10,402 --> 01:11:12,597
A priest with a secret.

645
01:11:30,802 --> 01:11:32,793
Easy! We had nothing to do with this.

646
01:11:32,882 --> 01:11:35,601
You have everything to do with this.

647
01:11:40,642 --> 01:11:43,440
- You're turning.
- Leave me alone.

648
01:11:43,522 --> 01:11:47,993
Your infection must have been slight
to begin with. lt can still be reversed.

649
01:11:48,082 --> 01:11:51,518
- How?
- Sunlight. Take her into the sunlight.

650
01:11:51,602 --> 01:11:55,914
Pray there is enough left of what is human
to survive the destruction of what is not.

651
01:11:56,002 --> 01:11:59,711
- We can do this. We're gonna do this.
- The agony will be unimaginable.

652
01:11:59,802 --> 01:12:03,715
No matter how strong her will. she will
fight her way back to the darkness.

653
01:12:03,802 --> 01:12:07,272
- You must not let her. Do you understand?
- Yeah.

654
01:12:07,362 --> 01:12:09,432
Good. Because l will be there if you fail.

655
01:12:26,042 --> 01:12:28,510
l could use somebody like you.

656
01:12:31,882 --> 01:12:33,679
Let's go.

657
01:12:39,202 --> 01:12:40,681
Almost there.

658
01:12:41,642 --> 01:12:44,156
Wait. wait. Stop. Luke. OK?
Just gimme a sec.

659
01:12:44,242 --> 01:12:46,961
No. Elizabeth. Come on.
Look. l know you're afraid.

660
01:12:47,042 --> 01:12:50,079
Come on. you can do this.
Come on. Come on.

661
01:12:50,162 --> 01:12:54,758
He said the light was gonna cure you. OK?
You can do this.

662
01:12:59,482 --> 01:13:01,757
Get out of here. Luke.
You can't help me.

663
01:13:01,842 --> 01:13:05,278
Elizabeth. come outside with me.
Come on. you can do this. Come on.

664
01:13:05,802 --> 01:13:09,511
- Come on. it's not too late.
- lt is too late.

665
01:13:18,762 --> 01:13:21,401
lt is too late.

666
01:13:47,042 --> 01:13:49,681
l know you're still here.

667
01:13:49,762 --> 01:13:52,230
You can't leave until the sun sets.

668
01:14:20,882 --> 01:14:26,081
Very noble. what you said to the girl
about the sunlight purging her of evil.

669
01:14:31,602 --> 01:14:33,911
But she's too far gone.
and you know it.

670
01:14:34,002 --> 01:14:36,197
You know she will die.

671
01:14:36,282 --> 01:14:38,955
Better by her own hand than mine.

672
01:14:39,042 --> 01:14:42,159
l like that.
You're more ruthless than l am.

673
01:14:46,162 --> 01:14:49,120
How does it feel
to exist in both worlds.

674
01:14:49,202 --> 01:14:51,397
darkness and light.

675
01:14:51,482 --> 01:14:53,791
and yet belong to neither?

676
01:14:54,442 --> 01:14:56,797
lf you must know...

677
01:14:57,922 --> 01:14:59,514
it sucks!

678
01:15:17,802 --> 01:15:22,159
May the Lord who frees you from sin
anoint you and lift you up.

679
01:15:22,242 --> 01:15:24,836
What is this? Last rites?

680
01:15:24,922 --> 01:15:27,720
You're giving me the last rites?

681
01:15:44,802 --> 01:15:49,432
May Christ who called you. Christ whom
you betrayed. Christ who forgives you.

682
01:15:49,522 --> 01:15:51,956
may Christ take you to himself.

683
01:15:54,682 --> 01:15:59,756
- May angels lead you to Abraham's side.
- l cannot die.

684
01:15:59,842 --> 01:16:02,117
l absolve you of all your sins.

685
01:16:02,202 --> 01:16:06,992
in the name of the almighty Father.
his blessed Son and the Holy Spirit.

686
01:16:07,082 --> 01:16:10,119
l don't want his forgiveness.

687
01:16:10,202 --> 01:16:12,318
You have it nonetheless.

688
01:16:12,402 --> 01:16:15,474
l deliver you now unto his judgement.

689
01:16:18,402 --> 01:16:21,758
Don't you wonder. priest.

690
01:16:21,842 --> 01:16:25,232
ever since you first
stared into the abyss and saw nothing?

691
01:16:25,322 --> 01:16:28,359
Don't you want to know the truth
before you take my head?

692
01:16:28,442 --> 01:16:30,672
- Silence!
- l knew him.

693
01:16:30,762 --> 01:16:32,992
Knew your Christ.

694
01:16:33,442 --> 01:16:37,037
Shared his agonies. Bore his secrets.

695
01:16:37,122 --> 01:16:40,797
There is nothing you can tell me
that l don't already know in my heart.

696
01:16:40,882 --> 01:16:43,874
l knew him better than anyone.

697
01:16:43,962 --> 01:16:46,874
Better than his own weeping mother.

698
01:16:46,962 --> 01:16:50,318
He loved me like a brother.

699
01:16:51,282 --> 01:16:54,991
l could show you how it began
and how it will end.

700
01:16:58,042 --> 01:16:59,236
No!

701
01:16:59,322 --> 01:17:00,960
No! No!

702
01:17:04,562 --> 01:17:05,517
No!

703
01:17:06,122 --> 01:17:08,431
Lies! Lies!

704
01:17:10,322 --> 01:17:12,119
Lies! Lies!

705
01:17:32,562 --> 01:17:35,713
Look around. All is death.

706
01:17:36,242 --> 01:17:40,394
Don't you think it's time
we put an end to it. once and for all?

707
01:18:02,562 --> 01:18:04,837
l'll find you.

708
01:18:05,602 --> 01:18:08,070
l'm counting on it.
