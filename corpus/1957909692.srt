1
00:00:04,091 --> 00:00:06,267
Ah.

2
00:00:06,397 --> 00:00:08,747
- Ah.
- Yo, J.C., J.C., you and me?

3
00:00:08,878 --> 00:00:10,575
Ah. Let's throw it.

4
00:00:10,706 --> 00:00:11,706
- Hey, hey, hey.
- Ah.

5
00:01:02,845 --> 00:01:04,064
Principal Williamson?

6
00:01:08,416 --> 00:01:09,696
All right, we'll set up in here.

7
00:01:11,810 --> 00:01:13,290
We'll set up in here.

8
00:01:13,421 --> 00:01:15,640
Ike Nicholson,
Sila Dawson, with SEI.

9
00:01:15,771 --> 00:01:17,729
- Oh.
- Thank you so much.

10
00:01:17,860 --> 00:01:19,142
We can page you
if we need you, right?

11
00:01:19,166 --> 00:01:20,406
Listen, also, I'd like any files

12
00:01:20,515 --> 00:01:23,518
on the investigation
you've performed so far, please.

13
00:01:23,648 --> 00:01:25,781
Wow, it's like a fuckin'
cop show in my own school.

14
00:01:25,911 --> 00:01:27,541
Only these guys
are Department of Education,

15
00:01:27,565 --> 00:01:29,915
partly teachers, partly cops,
like all teachers.

16
00:01:30,046 --> 00:01:30,829
They're good
at asking questions.

17
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:32,396
You answer their questions.

18
00:01:32,527 --> 00:01:33,721
You don't give them attitude.
That's the whole trick.

19
00:01:33,745 --> 00:01:36,008
You don't give them anything.

20
00:01:36,139 --> 00:01:38,117
The guy you didn't get to see speak,
that's Principal Williamson.

21
00:01:38,141 --> 00:01:39,501
He's the top douchebag
around here.

22
00:01:39,534 --> 00:01:40,534
He runs the place.

23
00:01:40,578 --> 00:01:42,711
He's got everything
under control.

24
00:01:42,841 --> 00:01:43,581
- Nobody's leaving!
- Calm down, please.

25
00:01:43,712 --> 00:01:44,756
Shut the fuck up!

26
00:01:44,887 --> 00:01:46,062
Shut up!

27
00:01:46,193 --> 00:01:49,283
Put your gun down.

28
00:01:50,762 --> 00:01:52,392
At the time of the flood,
they all went into the ark.

29
00:01:52,416 --> 00:01:54,418
All of the animals by agreement.

30
00:01:54,549 --> 00:01:56,396
It was the only time
the creatures of this world

31
00:01:56,420 --> 00:01:57,813
ever agreed upon anything.

32
00:01:57,943 --> 00:01:58,943
They really all did come.

33
00:01:59,989 --> 00:02:01,121
But the Ichthyosaurs didn't.

34
00:02:01,251 --> 00:02:03,688
Everybody said he should get
on board the ark,

35
00:02:03,819 --> 00:02:05,821
but he was very busy just then.

36
00:02:05,951 --> 00:02:07,886
Noah himself warned him
that the flood was coming,

37
00:02:07,910 --> 00:02:10,608
but he quietly said,
"I don't believe it."

38
00:02:10,739 --> 00:02:13,524
He was universally unpopular
when he drowned.

39
00:02:13,655 --> 00:02:14,917
Ah yes, they all said

40
00:02:15,047 --> 00:02:16,788
the Ichthyosaurus
won't be coming.

41
00:02:16,919 --> 00:02:18,877
He was the oldest beast
of them all.

42
00:02:19,008 --> 00:02:20,662
Well-qualified by his great experience,

43
00:02:20,792 --> 00:02:22,466
he could say whether
something such as a flood

44
00:02:22,490 --> 00:02:24,448
was or was not feasible.

45
00:02:24,579 --> 00:02:26,711
It's quite possible
if a similar situation arises...

46
00:02:29,018 --> 00:02:30,178
I shan't get on board either.

47
00:02:32,978 --> 00:02:33,978
Excuse me.

48
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,683
I arrived at 9:00 a.m.

49
00:02:41,813 --> 00:02:42,814
As soon as I got in,

50
00:02:43,946 --> 00:02:45,252
I heard their voices.

51
00:02:46,818 --> 00:02:48,516
And I heard that
there was a fire

52
00:02:48,646 --> 00:02:49,646
on the fourth floor lab.

53
00:02:52,955 --> 00:02:54,261
So I responded immediately.

54
00:02:56,176 --> 00:02:57,816
There was orange powder
all over the room.

55
00:02:59,004 --> 00:03:00,180
From the fire extinguishers.

56
00:03:01,442 --> 00:03:02,704
Mm-hmm.

57
00:03:02,834 --> 00:03:04,532
Um...

58
00:03:04,662 --> 00:03:05,662
then a student told me

59
00:03:06,838 --> 00:03:08,623
another student was on fire,

60
00:03:08,753 --> 00:03:11,408
and he was brought
to the room across the hall.

61
00:03:11,539 --> 00:03:13,367
So, I went to the room,

62
00:03:13,497 --> 00:03:16,370
and there was
the English teacher,

63
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:17,632
Jamie Freeman,

64
00:03:19,068 --> 00:03:21,766
and the school nurse, Mrs...

65
00:03:21,897 --> 00:03:24,160
It's, uh, Karen Pitt.

66
00:03:24,291 --> 00:03:26,031
- Yeah, Miss Pitt...
- Mm-hmm.

67
00:03:26,162 --> 00:03:28,730
And they were administering
first aid to Matty.

68
00:03:30,035 --> 00:03:31,298
He was...

69
00:03:34,301 --> 00:03:37,086
His ear was melted off,
and there was

70
00:03:37,217 --> 00:03:38,609
a hole in his shirt and...

71
00:03:40,524 --> 00:03:41,524
Okay.

72
00:03:42,744 --> 00:03:44,702
How is, how is Matty?

73
00:03:47,227 --> 00:03:48,053
You did well.

74
00:03:48,184 --> 00:03:50,142
Thank you.

75
00:03:50,273 --> 00:03:51,753
Tell me about Miss Dhawan.

76
00:03:54,059 --> 00:03:55,899
I was told she
was brought to the faculty room.

77
00:03:57,933 --> 00:04:00,283
FDNY asked me
to bring her back to room 42.

78
00:04:03,112 --> 00:04:04,512
She didn't want
to go back in there.

79
00:04:05,941 --> 00:04:07,334
I get it.

80
00:04:12,164 --> 00:04:13,557
All right. Thank you.

81
00:04:14,906 --> 00:04:15,906
- Thank you.
- After you.

82
00:04:27,005 --> 00:04:30,226
D-H-A-W-A-N.

83
00:04:30,357 --> 00:04:32,054
What engine are you guys from?

84
00:04:32,184 --> 00:04:33,925
- Engine 11.
- All right.

85
00:04:34,056 --> 00:04:35,753
All right, take us
through what happened.

86
00:04:37,581 --> 00:04:40,454
Uh, I set out four beakers.

87
00:04:41,890 --> 00:04:44,762
There was a solution
of nitrate and water,

88
00:04:44,893 --> 00:04:47,156
um, that I prepared
the night before.

89
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:48,113
- And how often do you...
- And then.

90
00:04:48,244 --> 00:04:49,463
Do this experiment?

91
00:04:49,593 --> 00:04:53,249
Um, it's, um,
it's pretty standard but, um...

92
00:04:53,380 --> 00:04:54,380
Um, What happened then?

93
00:04:56,383 --> 00:04:58,820
I turned the Bunsen burner on...

94
00:04:58,950 --> 00:05:00,256
Are the students wearing

95
00:05:00,387 --> 00:05:01,799
any sort of
safety equipment for this?

96
00:05:01,823 --> 00:05:03,259
I wasn't planning on involving

97
00:05:03,390 --> 00:05:05,609
any of the students
in the experiment.

98
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:08,786
Huh, plans.
That's the thing about plans.

99
00:05:08,917 --> 00:05:10,111
They never go the way
you think they will.

100
00:05:10,135 --> 00:05:11,006
How 'bout yourself?

101
00:05:11,136 --> 00:05:13,138
Uh, yes, I had, um,

102
00:05:13,269 --> 00:05:14,575
I had safety goggles on, yes.

103
00:05:17,142 --> 00:05:20,145
And then you would take
and, uh, take the stick

104
00:05:20,276 --> 00:05:21,973
and place it over the flame.

105
00:05:22,104 --> 00:05:25,150
And a color would shoot out,
a different color

106
00:05:25,281 --> 00:05:27,762
for each
of the different solutions.

107
00:05:27,892 --> 00:05:29,546
Then, uh, the students were...

108
00:05:32,984 --> 00:05:35,378
they were, they seemed
to like the experiment,

109
00:05:35,509 --> 00:05:38,903
so they were asking
for more colors, more colors.

110
00:05:39,034 --> 00:05:42,559
Uh, So I brought
four more beakers out

111
00:05:43,952 --> 00:05:46,128
that I had prepared
also the night before.

112
00:05:46,258 --> 00:05:47,858
I'd prepared everything
the night before.

113
00:05:47,956 --> 00:05:49,479
And, um...

114
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:54,223
same thing, um,

115
00:05:54,354 --> 00:05:56,921
but Matty and some of the kids
were being disruptive

116
00:05:57,052 --> 00:05:58,967
so I asked Matty
to come up and...

117
00:05:59,097 --> 00:06:00,185
Is that Matty Fairchild?

118
00:06:00,316 --> 00:06:02,362
Yes, Matty Fairchild.

119
00:06:02,492 --> 00:06:04,102
You asked a disruptive child
to come up?

120
00:06:07,845 --> 00:06:10,239
He came and stood
right here, right next to me.

121
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:12,067
He took one of the sticks...

122
00:06:12,197 --> 00:06:14,156
Excuse me, did you have
any safety equipment

123
00:06:14,286 --> 00:06:15,810
for Matty?

124
00:06:15,940 --> 00:06:16,940
No.

125
00:06:19,727 --> 00:06:22,512
He took one of the sticks,
and he put it over

126
00:06:23,948 --> 00:06:25,994
the Bunsen burner,
and then there was this huge,

127
00:06:26,124 --> 00:06:28,692
like, fireball that came out,

128
00:06:28,823 --> 00:06:29,823
like a white flame.

129
00:06:33,088 --> 00:06:34,655
I think he let the stick fall.

130
00:06:34,785 --> 00:06:35,786
Yeah.

131
00:06:37,222 --> 00:06:38,702
Yes.

132
00:06:38,833 --> 00:06:40,965
And then it seemed
like everything was on fire.

133
00:06:41,096 --> 00:06:43,707
And, and then one of the,
one of the students brought me

134
00:06:43,838 --> 00:06:45,638
one of the fire extinguishers,
and I couldn't,

135
00:06:45,709 --> 00:06:46,709
I couldn't, I couldn't...

136
00:06:46,797 --> 00:06:48,059
What do you think you're doing?

137
00:06:48,190 --> 00:06:49,409
What's going on here?

138
00:06:49,539 --> 00:06:51,149
- That's Erin Bennett.
- Oh Christ.

139
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:52,716
He's the teacher union rep.

140
00:06:52,847 --> 00:06:54,172
He's been coming around here
a lot lately.

141
00:06:54,196 --> 00:06:56,981
Mainly because of him.
He hates his guts.

142
00:06:57,112 --> 00:07:00,376
Jess, there's an issue involving
an accident with a teacher,

143
00:07:00,507 --> 00:07:01,986
teacher's union needs
to be here.

144
00:07:02,117 --> 00:07:03,335
You guys all should know that.

145
00:07:03,466 --> 00:07:05,009
- I didn't know, I'm sorry.
- All right, come on,

146
00:07:05,033 --> 00:07:06,750
- Lisa, let's go.
- You've gotta be kidding?

147
00:07:06,774 --> 00:07:08,334
No, I'm not kidding you.
Lisa, let's go.

148
00:07:09,994 --> 00:07:11,953
You know, thank you, Jess,
for letting me know.

149
00:07:12,083 --> 00:07:13,243
I appreciate that, all right.

150
00:07:16,261 --> 00:07:17,437
Thank you for your time.

151
00:07:25,009 --> 00:07:27,272
By the way, forgive me,
I forgot to introduce myself.

152
00:07:27,403 --> 00:07:30,188
My name is Matty,
I'm the victim.

153
00:07:32,843 --> 00:07:34,062
Yeah.

154
00:07:39,110 --> 00:07:40,764
Boo.

155
00:07:40,895 --> 00:07:42,113
- What, it's over?
- Yeah.

156
00:07:42,244 --> 00:07:44,376
That's it?

157
00:07:44,507 --> 00:07:46,161
Well, these were the fo...

158
00:07:46,291 --> 00:07:48,356
these were the four solvents
that you studied, right?

159
00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:49,947
- Boo!
- The solutions.

160
00:07:50,078 --> 00:07:51,993
Well, you wanna...
Those are the four that were

161
00:07:52,123 --> 00:07:54,243
gonna be on your pop quiz.
Don't let me make it worse.

162
00:07:54,386 --> 00:07:56,214
More colors.

163
00:07:56,345 --> 00:07:57,868
More colors!

164
00:07:57,999 --> 00:07:59,159
- Matty, Matty.
- More colors,

165
00:07:59,261 --> 00:08:02,133
more colors, more colors,

166
00:08:02,264 --> 00:08:03,787

00:08:27,071 --> 00:08:28,222
You're gonna help me with this.

180
00:08:28,246 --> 00:08:29,291
Ooooh.

181
00:08:29,421 --> 00:08:30,771
Come on, come on.

182
00:08:30,901 --> 00:08:32,294
Matty, Matty, Matty...

183
00:08:32,424 --> 00:08:34,122
Settle down, settle down.

184
00:08:34,252 --> 00:08:35,515
Matty, get up here, come on.

185
00:08:35,645 --> 00:08:36,994
- Do it, you're cool.
- Over here.

186
00:08:37,125 --> 00:08:38,165
Oh, what are you afraid of?

187
00:08:38,256 --> 00:08:39,296
All right, come over here.

188
00:08:39,344 --> 00:08:40,624
All right, come on. Turn around.

189
00:08:40,650 --> 00:08:41,932
- Stay right here.
- More colors, more colors.

190
00:08:41,956 --> 00:08:43,044
Over here.

191
00:08:43,174 --> 00:08:44,741
- Oh.
- Oh, come on.

192
00:08:44,872 --> 00:08:47,309
I'm a failure, That's me.

193
00:08:47,439 --> 00:08:48,789
Come on, Matty.

194
00:08:48,919 --> 00:08:50,519
All right, we're gonna
do the same thing.

195
00:08:50,617 --> 00:08:52,488
We have
a different salt solution.

196
00:08:52,619 --> 00:08:53,489
Matty's gonna put it
over the flame

197
00:08:53,620 --> 00:08:55,143
and we're gonna
identify what it is.

198
00:08:55,273 --> 00:08:56,448
Matty come on, hurry up.

199
00:08:56,579 --> 00:08:59,060
Matty, Matty, Matty...

200
00:08:59,190 --> 00:09:00,409
Come on, Matty, come on.

201
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:03,891
Matty, Matty, Matty,

202
00:09:04,021 --> 00:09:07,068
Matty, Matty, Matty!

203
00:09:23,954 --> 00:09:26,043
And you have
my sincere apologies. I,

204
00:09:26,174 --> 00:09:27,392
I realize that you...

205
00:09:27,523 --> 00:09:30,526
Well, ye... yep, yes.

206
00:09:30,657 --> 00:09:32,833
Yep, of course.

207
00:09:32,963 --> 00:09:35,096
Yes, I...

208
00:09:35,226 --> 00:09:37,185
No, of course you almost had
a heart attack.

209
00:09:37,315 --> 00:09:40,144
Of course, I-I, I do.
Okay, okay, goodbye.

210
00:09:48,109 --> 00:09:49,109
What did it say?

211
00:09:49,197 --> 00:09:50,609
- I need to see what it says.
- It, it said...

212
00:09:50,633 --> 00:09:51,460
Please, can you
pull it up, please.

213
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:52,722
I need to see what it says.

214
00:09:56,465 --> 00:09:58,075
There.

215
00:09:58,206 --> 00:10:01,296
There was a terrible accident
in a classroom,

216
00:10:01,426 --> 00:10:04,255
and a student
is hospitalized as a result.

217
00:10:07,041 --> 00:10:08,346
What did I ask you to do?

218
00:10:08,477 --> 00:10:10,305
You wanted me
to call an ambulance.

219
00:10:10,435 --> 00:10:12,220
You did that?

220
00:10:12,350 --> 00:10:13,676
- Yeah, I-I called the ambulance.
- Okay, and then?

221
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:17,094
And you wanted me
to get Ana and Karen

222
00:10:17,225 --> 00:10:18,419
to go with the kids
to the hospital, I...

223
00:10:18,443 --> 00:10:20,054
And after that.

224
00:10:20,184 --> 00:10:22,230
You wanted me
to email the parents.

225
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:25,929
The parents, the parents,
not all parents!

226
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:28,323
Is it... Do you see how
a parent could read that

227
00:10:28,453 --> 00:10:29,474
- and think...
- Yes, yes, yes.

228
00:10:29,498 --> 00:10:31,587
That it's their child? Are...

229
00:10:31,718 --> 00:10:33,458
- I do, yes, sorry.
- I-I don't need you,

230
00:10:33,589 --> 00:10:35,373
I don't need you to be sorry.

231
00:10:35,504 --> 00:10:37,941
I need you to not make mistakes
like this,

232
00:10:38,072 --> 00:10:39,432
because this is not
the first time.

233
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:49,083
Excuse me, do you know where
is Robert Coles High School?

234
00:10:49,213 --> 00:10:49,997
What school?

235
00:10:50,127 --> 00:10:51,259
Robert Coles.

236
00:10:55,655 --> 00:10:56,960
Excuse me.

237
00:11:03,140 --> 00:11:04,140
That's Toni.

238
00:11:05,229 --> 00:11:06,274
What?

239
00:11:07,492 --> 00:11:08,842
I'd have done anything for her.

240
00:11:08,972 --> 00:11:10,670
Pot, pills, you name it.

241
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:13,411
But for that, she had Adam.

242
00:11:15,283 --> 00:11:19,722
Just, um, don't take
them together, okay?

243
00:11:21,506 --> 00:11:22,507
Thanks.

244
00:11:22,638 --> 00:11:24,727
How are you feeling?

245
00:11:24,858 --> 00:11:27,948
There's just so much going on.
I don't even, I don't know.

246
00:11:29,297 --> 00:11:30,297
Well, you want some?

247
00:11:31,647 --> 00:11:32,735
- Yeah.
- To help you out.

248
00:11:36,260 --> 00:11:37,392
Dad, what're you doing here?

249
00:11:37,522 --> 00:11:39,481
What is this? Who is this?
Hey, who is that?

250
00:11:39,611 --> 00:11:41,439
Hey, yo, who are you?

251
00:11:41,570 --> 00:11:42,919
Who is it? Is that a teacher?

252
00:11:43,050 --> 00:11:44,244
- No, it...
- Is that a teacher?

253
00:11:44,268 --> 00:11:45,593
- It... He's my friend.
- Is he a teacher here?

254
00:11:45,617 --> 00:11:47,532
No, no, no, he's not a teacher.

255
00:11:47,663 --> 00:11:49,012
What are you doing here?

256
00:11:49,143 --> 00:11:50,555
Aren't you supposed
to be at the clinic?

257
00:11:50,579 --> 00:11:51,667
I-I took...

258
00:11:51,798 --> 00:11:53,974
I, um,
there's a big meeting today.

259
00:11:54,104 --> 00:11:55,384
All the parents
have to be there.

260
00:11:56,672 --> 00:11:58,630
Mom's gonna be there.

261
00:11:58,761 --> 00:12:00,041
I'm-I'm dealing
with your mother,

262
00:12:00,067 --> 00:12:01,348
but just tell me
what happened, what...

263
00:12:01,372 --> 00:12:03,244
Deal with her? That's what
you say every time,

264
00:12:03,374 --> 00:12:04,612
and then you start
shouting at each other.

265
00:12:04,636 --> 00:12:06,987
All right, that's...
It, it'll be fine.

266
00:12:07,117 --> 00:12:09,250
Tell me what happened.
Did you know this kid?

267
00:12:09,380 --> 00:12:10,077
Is he a friend of yours?

268
00:12:10,207 --> 00:12:12,166
Yes.

269
00:12:14,211 --> 00:12:16,474
I'm, I'm sorry.

270
00:12:16,605 --> 00:12:17,605
- You okay?
- Yeah.

271
00:12:17,693 --> 00:12:19,173
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

272
00:12:19,303 --> 00:12:20,983
Come on, you can talk
to me, you know that.

273
00:12:22,089 --> 00:12:23,169
What's wrong? What's wrong?

274
00:12:24,526 --> 00:12:26,093
Mom told me that

275
00:12:26,223 --> 00:12:27,303
you started drinking again.

276
00:12:28,269 --> 00:12:29,444
I'm sorry.

277
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:35,667
No, I, uh, I-I took...
What, what, what...

278
00:12:35,798 --> 00:12:37,669
What was that?
What did he give you?

279
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:39,280
- It's just Tylenol,
- No.

280
00:12:39,410 --> 00:12:41,282
I had a headache.

281
00:12:41,412 --> 00:12:42,413
This isn't Tylenol.

282
00:12:43,545 --> 00:12:44,938
Dad, I gotta go.

283
00:12:50,334 --> 00:12:52,032
I told you.

284
00:12:52,162 --> 00:12:53,990
- Dad, no. I have to go.
- No.

285
00:12:54,121 --> 00:12:55,402
- I have to go to class.
- Toni, listen,

286
00:12:55,426 --> 00:12:57,777
Please just talk to me.
Just, just talk to me.

287
00:13:08,222 --> 00:13:09,789
There's a passage
I got memorized

288
00:13:09,919 --> 00:13:11,834
that seems appropriate
for the situation.

289
00:13:15,185 --> 00:13:17,025
The world you see is just
a movie in your mind.

290
00:13:20,451 --> 00:13:21,801
Nobody understands it.

291
00:13:23,150 --> 00:13:24,150
Nobody listens.

292
00:13:27,154 --> 00:13:28,024
They're all running around

293
00:13:28,155 --> 00:13:29,809
like chickens
with heads cut off.

294
00:13:35,205 --> 00:13:36,903
- Hey.
- Hey!

295
00:13:38,165 --> 00:13:39,644
It's not your fault.

296
00:13:39,775 --> 00:13:40,863
What's not my fault?

297
00:13:43,344 --> 00:13:44,424
- What's wrong?
- Yesterday.

298
00:13:46,608 --> 00:13:47,608
Yeah, I know.

299
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:56,487
Look, I gotta put
these trays out.

300
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:01,536
You're a flirt.

301
00:14:01,666 --> 00:14:02,754
I can't help it.

302
00:14:02,885 --> 00:14:04,060
You're lucky I love you.

303
00:14:04,191 --> 00:14:05,801
Hi. I'm Ross.
They told me that you have

304
00:14:05,932 --> 00:14:07,412
- something for me.
- Oh hi, I'm Anna.

305
00:14:07,498 --> 00:14:08,238
Hi.

306
00:14:08,369 --> 00:14:10,197
Excuse me.

307
00:14:10,327 --> 00:14:12,634
Do you know where
is Robert Coles High School?

308
00:14:12,764 --> 00:14:13,853
I've never heard of it.

309
00:15:10,822 --> 00:15:12,041
I know how hard this is.

310
00:15:13,347 --> 00:15:14,347
I get it.

311
00:15:15,653 --> 00:15:17,453
So I'll just take
his things right, and, uh...

312
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:35,064
How the fuck do you get it?

313
00:15:36,544 --> 00:15:39,808
What, what, what makes
you think you get it?

314
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:41,679
You get it, you really get

315
00:15:41,810 --> 00:15:43,551
what the fuck
is going on with me right now?

316
00:15:47,511 --> 00:15:48,831
Is that what they
tell you to say?

317
00:15:50,297 --> 00:15:52,864
They tell you to say, oh,
the father's gonna come in,

318
00:15:52,995 --> 00:15:54,692
just to make him
feel like you know

319
00:15:54,823 --> 00:15:56,607
what he's going
through right now.

320
00:15:56,738 --> 00:15:59,480
Just make him feel like, uh,
everything's gonna be fine.

321
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:03,745
His face is, like, gone. It's...

322
00:16:03,875 --> 00:16:04,964
He's not...

323
00:16:12,406 --> 00:16:13,406
Was he scared?

324
00:16:15,452 --> 00:16:16,452
I don't know.

325
00:16:23,330 --> 00:16:25,071
Did he say any,
he didn't say anything?

326
00:16:26,550 --> 00:16:29,336
No, but he sq...
he definitely squeezed my hand.

327
00:16:29,466 --> 00:16:30,728
I could feel him.
He was there.

328
00:16:35,124 --> 00:16:36,724
You don't know
what happened at all, huh?

329
00:16:37,953 --> 00:16:39,172
I'm so sorry.

330
00:16:42,262 --> 00:16:43,262
Here you go.

331
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:14,511
I can't, I can't.

332
00:17:27,176 --> 00:17:28,656
I'm like, oh,
I can't let that happen.

333
00:17:28,786 --> 00:17:30,136
Good morning.
How we doing today?

334
00:17:31,354 --> 00:17:32,354
Who, Tomas?

335
00:17:32,442 --> 00:17:33,748
Yeah, 'cause it's all...

336
00:17:33,878 --> 00:17:36,577
I know yesterday was
a really, uh, was a really...

337
00:17:36,707 --> 00:17:38,274
rough day for everyone, okay.

338
00:17:38,405 --> 00:17:39,685
But I'm happy to see your faces.

339
00:17:39,754 --> 00:17:41,364
I think it's good
for us to be together.

340
00:17:42,757 --> 00:17:43,888
Ah, Miss Green.

341
00:17:44,019 --> 00:17:45,325
She knows her shit,

342
00:17:45,455 --> 00:17:47,501
and she always casts me
as the lead in her plays.

343
00:17:47,631 --> 00:17:48,826
I mean, I was right next to him.

344
00:17:48,850 --> 00:17:51,505
I literally saw it hit him.

345
00:17:51,635 --> 00:17:54,769
It was, it was like a fireball.
I didn't know what to do.

346
00:17:54,899 --> 00:17:57,293
It was, it was terrifying.

347
00:17:57,424 --> 00:17:58,294
Alex is always right next to me.

348
00:17:58,425 --> 00:17:59,513
He's a real go-getter.

349
00:17:59,643 --> 00:18:01,603
Half Italian, half Cuban.
He wants to be an actor.

350
00:18:01,732 --> 00:18:03,082
He wants to be me.

351
00:18:04,431 --> 00:18:06,041
He's the understudy.

352
00:18:06,172 --> 00:18:07,410
Like one second,
everything was fine,

353
00:18:07,434 --> 00:18:08,541
and then the next second,
there was just chaos.

354
00:18:08,565 --> 00:18:11,090
It-it, I mean, it just
happened, you know, and...

355
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:12,874
That's Rod.
He wants to be deep.

356
00:18:13,004 --> 00:18:16,007
There is no why. It just did.

357
00:18:16,138 --> 00:18:18,836
Paul.
Only Chris knows Paul.

358
00:18:18,967 --> 00:18:20,466
You think she, like,
mixed up the chemicals

359
00:18:20,490 --> 00:18:21,772
- or something the second time?
- I don't know,

360
00:18:21,796 --> 00:18:23,580
She didn't mix up the chemicals.

361
00:18:23,711 --> 00:18:25,558
So then why would it be,
why would it be different?

362
00:18:25,582 --> 00:18:27,256
Julia. She's captain
of the volleyball team.

363
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:29,760
She's a member of the Chinese
and National Honor Society,

364
00:18:29,891 --> 00:18:31,632
and she's been playing violin
for ten years.

365
00:18:31,762 --> 00:18:33,000
One day she'll be president
of the United States,

366
00:18:33,024 --> 00:18:34,200
you mark my words.

367
00:18:34,330 --> 00:18:35,610
How come it
didn't happen to her?

368
00:18:37,072 --> 00:18:38,354
I don't know.
It was just an accident, guys.

369
00:18:38,378 --> 00:18:39,466
And Karla.

370
00:18:39,596 --> 00:18:40,704
I wish I had
an answer, I don't...

371
00:18:40,728 --> 00:18:41,729
Joe.

372
00:18:41,859 --> 00:18:42,923
It couldn't have just
happened like

373
00:18:42,947 --> 00:18:43,968
if he dropped the stick
in or something...

374
00:18:43,992 --> 00:18:45,907
And Kid. Kid loves his music
more than words.

375
00:18:46,037 --> 00:18:47,387
And Toni more than his music.

376
00:18:47,517 --> 00:18:48,973
- Well, I mean...
- Could it, I mean...

377
00:18:48,997 --> 00:18:50,583
It happened when he,
when he held it out.

378
00:18:50,607 --> 00:18:52,043
No, he held it out.

379
00:18:52,174 --> 00:18:53,654
That's how it happened.
I saw it.

380
00:18:53,784 --> 00:18:55,656
He didn't drop it.
As soon as he pulled it up,

381
00:18:55,786 --> 00:18:56,786
that's when it happened.

382
00:18:56,831 --> 00:18:59,050
However,
she's still responsible.

383
00:18:59,181 --> 00:19:01,140
This is, this was her class,
you know.

384
00:19:01,270 --> 00:19:03,359
How 'bout you, J.C.?
What do you...

385
00:19:03,490 --> 00:19:04,610
do you have anything to say?

386
00:19:06,580 --> 00:19:07,798
Whatever.

387
00:19:07,929 --> 00:19:09,931
Whatever?
Matty was your best friend.

388
00:19:11,062 --> 00:19:12,151
Is your best friend.

389
00:19:14,022 --> 00:19:15,719
J.C.'s a good guy.

390
00:19:15,850 --> 00:19:18,635
He looks tough and like
he doesn't care, but he does.

391
00:19:18,766 --> 00:19:20,202
And he always feels guilty.

392
00:19:20,333 --> 00:19:22,493
He feels guilty when his dad
beats the shit out of him.

393
00:19:22,596 --> 00:19:24,095
He feels guilty that
he didn't stop me that day,

394
00:19:24,119 --> 00:19:25,468
or any day, really.

395
00:19:25,599 --> 00:19:27,775
J.C. can never stop me
from doin' shit.

396
00:19:27,905 --> 00:19:28,993
How 'bout you, Lawrence?

397
00:19:29,124 --> 00:19:31,561
I-I have to, I have to think.

398
00:19:31,692 --> 00:19:32,562
You have to think?

399
00:19:32,693 --> 00:19:34,173
I have to think.
I can't speak.

400
00:19:37,045 --> 00:19:39,221
Smart ass Lawrence.
You can't overlook Lawrence.

401
00:19:40,744 --> 00:19:42,833
I saw my best friend
go up in flames,

402
00:19:42,964 --> 00:19:45,662
so you're gonna ask me
how I feel?

403
00:19:45,793 --> 00:19:47,882
You're really asking me
how I'm affected

404
00:19:48,012 --> 00:19:49,579
by my friend's death?

405
00:19:49,710 --> 00:19:50,798
He's not dead!

406
00:19:50,928 --> 00:19:52,452
He can die.
He can die!

407
00:19:52,582 --> 00:19:54,105
- He can die...
- He's not dead though!

408
00:19:54,236 --> 00:19:55,498
The whole point of this

409
00:19:55,629 --> 00:19:57,892
is to talk about our feelings,
not to blame people.

410
00:19:58,022 --> 00:19:59,130
Well, maybe if Lawrence
would stop blaming people

411
00:19:59,154 --> 00:20:00,954
all the time, acting like
he's better than us!

412
00:20:01,069 --> 00:20:02,070
Better than you, okay.

413
00:20:02,201 --> 00:20:03,332
I am not better than you...

414
00:20:03,463 --> 00:20:04,812
Yeah, you're not, shut up!

415
00:20:04,942 --> 00:20:05,682
- Calm down,
- Lawrence,

416
00:20:05,813 --> 00:20:07,206
I see your point.

417
00:20:07,336 --> 00:20:09,376
His life as he knew it is,
is not gonna be the same.

418
00:20:13,995 --> 00:20:15,275
I know what
you all think, right,

419
00:20:15,301 --> 00:20:17,564
that it,
it could've been you, right.

420
00:20:17,694 --> 00:20:18,802
You were all in the class,
you were all doing

421
00:20:18,826 --> 00:20:20,654
the experiment.

422
00:20:20,784 --> 00:20:22,699
You all think
it could've been you, right?

423
00:20:22,830 --> 00:20:23,961
Yeah.

424
00:20:26,225 --> 00:20:27,748
Toni, are you okay?

425
00:20:27,878 --> 00:20:29,097
She's not okay.

426
00:20:30,707 --> 00:20:32,907
Hey, I just, I don't really
wanna talk about this, okay?

427
00:20:34,145 --> 00:20:35,451
I'm sorry.

428
00:20:35,582 --> 00:20:37,758
We were just in front of a fire.

429
00:20:37,888 --> 00:20:41,544
We just saw our friend
get burnt in a fire.

430
00:20:46,288 --> 00:20:48,159
I-I was, I was in a panic.

431
00:20:48,290 --> 00:20:51,772
You know,
the right word is shock.

432
00:20:53,426 --> 00:20:58,213
A lot of people are shocked
under surprise circumstances.

433
00:20:58,344 --> 00:21:00,171
It's common for a person
to be shocked

434
00:21:00,302 --> 00:21:01,912
when a child
under their supervision

435
00:21:02,043 --> 00:21:04,306
is suddenly on fire.

436
00:21:04,437 --> 00:21:05,805
I mean, in your opinion
then, did Miss Dhawan

437
00:21:05,829 --> 00:21:07,091
do anything out of the ordinary

438
00:21:07,222 --> 00:21:08,745
or was it by the book?

439
00:21:10,747 --> 00:21:14,055
Eh, I mean, she could've
set it up differently, sure.

440
00:21:14,185 --> 00:21:16,100
How?

441
00:21:16,231 --> 00:21:18,755
Jason Phillips.
The bad ass amongst teachers.

442
00:21:18,886 --> 00:21:20,627
When I grow up,
I wanna be just like him.

443
00:21:20,757 --> 00:21:22,890
He knows everything,
and he can do anything

444
00:21:23,020 --> 00:21:24,805
better than everybody else.

445
00:21:24,935 --> 00:21:28,069
Because methanol has
a very low boiling point

446
00:21:28,199 --> 00:21:29,679
any spark can, can set it off.

447
00:21:29,810 --> 00:21:30,810
As far as we know though,

448
00:21:30,854 --> 00:21:32,856
Miss Dhawan didn't use
any methanol.

449
00:21:32,987 --> 00:21:34,815
Well,

450
00:21:34,945 --> 00:21:37,265
I can't imagine anything else
reacting the way that it did.

451
00:21:38,775 --> 00:21:39,907
But I, I could be wrong.

452
00:21:40,037 --> 00:21:42,257
He's never wrong.

453
00:21:42,388 --> 00:21:44,303
I can't, I can't say that I...

454
00:21:45,739 --> 00:21:47,523
I can't say that
it wasn't working.

455
00:21:47,654 --> 00:21:49,003
I don't know. I don't remember.

456
00:21:49,133 --> 00:21:52,572
Okay, do you remember saying,
"I burned a kid,"

457
00:21:52,702 --> 00:21:55,618
or "Oh, my God,
I set a kid on fire?"

458
00:22:08,152 --> 00:22:10,154
It could have happened
to anyone.

459
00:22:10,285 --> 00:22:13,767
Goggles, if there's
an explosion and flame,

460
00:22:13,897 --> 00:22:15,658
goggles aren't really
gonna do much of anything

461
00:22:15,682 --> 00:22:18,206
against a fire,
although I'm sure

462
00:22:18,337 --> 00:22:20,643
after all the VOs and the NOVs,

463
00:22:20,774 --> 00:22:22,414
everything will be brought up
to standard.

464
00:22:23,254 --> 00:22:24,710
Little late for Matty,
don't you think?

465
00:22:24,734 --> 00:22:25,953
Phew!

466
00:22:26,083 --> 00:22:28,347
Someone's head
is gonna roll over this.

467
00:22:30,174 --> 00:22:33,352
That could be yours,
could be someone else's.

468
00:22:35,441 --> 00:22:36,964
Any experiment is dangerous.

469
00:22:37,094 --> 00:22:38,094
Right.

470
00:22:39,445 --> 00:22:42,273
So, how can we do our jobs

471
00:22:42,404 --> 00:22:44,885
if we don't do
these experiments?

472
00:22:45,015 --> 00:22:47,278
I mean, it's like gym class.
Gym class is dangerous.

473
00:22:47,409 --> 00:22:50,673
You know,
we can't do our jobs if...

474
00:22:50,804 --> 00:22:52,675
We can't do any experiments.
I mean,

475
00:22:52,806 --> 00:22:55,112
I mean, how much chemistry
do you guys know?

476
00:22:55,243 --> 00:22:57,221
I know enough to know
that kids don't usually burst

477
00:22:57,245 --> 00:22:58,377
into flame during gym class.

478
00:23:00,857 --> 00:23:03,512
Look, something happened,
you know. Accidents happen.

479
00:23:07,342 --> 00:23:09,300
Would you say that
this is Miss Dhawan's fault?

480
00:23:09,431 --> 00:23:10,867
That, that this
accident occurred

481
00:23:10,998 --> 00:23:12,129
because she was not careful?

482
00:23:15,785 --> 00:23:18,005
Tha... look, I...

483
00:23:18,135 --> 00:23:19,135
If she...

484
00:23:20,355 --> 00:23:21,661
You're not on trial.

485
00:23:21,791 --> 00:23:25,186
I know, but I feel... Look,
this is a fellow teacher.

486
00:23:25,316 --> 00:23:26,666
I mean, it's one of my students.

487
00:23:28,755 --> 00:23:30,104
It's really hard.

488
00:23:30,234 --> 00:23:31,777
I don't know how she's gonna
live with herself, all right.

489
00:23:31,801 --> 00:23:33,586
I don't know how she's
gonna be able

490
00:23:33,716 --> 00:23:35,718
to get through her days.

491
00:23:35,849 --> 00:23:39,330
I mean, you make
a mistake like this

492
00:23:39,461 --> 00:23:40,201
- All right.
- It's not easy

493
00:23:40,331 --> 00:23:42,116
to be a teacher
these days, okay.

494
00:23:42,246 --> 00:23:45,206
Yes, all right.
Thank you, Mr. Phillips.

495
00:23:45,336 --> 00:23:46,401
We'll be in...
Will you be in later

496
00:23:46,425 --> 00:23:47,619
in case we have questions, or...

497
00:23:47,643 --> 00:23:49,384
Yeah, sure.

498
00:23:49,515 --> 00:23:50,864
- Okay, thanks.
- Thank you.

499
00:23:50,994 --> 00:23:52,909
It's not easy to be
a teacher, my ass.

500
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:54,737
Why is it not easy
to be a teacher?

501
00:23:54,868 --> 00:23:57,087
You just have to tell us
what the fuck to do.

502
00:23:57,218 --> 00:23:59,960
And we're all the same,
makes us easier to teach.

503
00:24:00,090 --> 00:24:02,919
Teaches us to be just like them.

504
00:24:03,050 --> 00:24:06,445
Eat, sleep, make money
for someone else, and die.

505
00:24:06,575 --> 00:24:09,230
Eat, sleep, make money
for someone else, and die!

506
00:24:18,152 --> 00:24:19,152
Hi.

507
00:24:21,808 --> 00:24:24,027
I have to go to the hospital,
so I wanted to...

508
00:24:24,158 --> 00:24:25,812
I didn't know what
to do with this, so...

509
00:24:25,942 --> 00:24:27,302
- Yeah, sure.
- Figured I'd put it,

510
00:24:28,336 --> 00:24:29,856
I didn't really
know that he was, um...

511
00:24:32,819 --> 00:24:34,734
I didn't know
he was so into art.

512
00:24:34,864 --> 00:24:36,144
It's really beautiful, isn't it?

513
00:24:38,912 --> 00:24:41,088
Yeah, I guess. I don't know,
I don't know what it...

514
00:24:41,218 --> 00:24:42,587
I don't know what it is?
What is it?

515
00:24:42,611 --> 00:24:44,251
Ah, come on.
It's pretty obvious isn't it?

516
00:24:45,353 --> 00:24:46,789
Mr. Prasec says it's not art

517
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:48,506
unless it has the potential
to be a disaster.

518
00:24:48,530 --> 00:24:50,053
It looks like kinda burnt here.

519
00:24:51,881 --> 00:24:52,273
- He didn't get...
- Everybody was supposed

520
00:24:52,403 --> 00:24:53,796
to do this?

521
00:24:53,927 --> 00:24:55,972
Was he working on,
like, a tree, uh,

522
00:24:56,103 --> 00:24:57,278
a tree thing?

523
00:24:59,454 --> 00:25:02,283
He's really into,
like, myths and symbols.

524
00:25:02,413 --> 00:25:04,111
We talked about it
a lot actually.

525
00:25:04,241 --> 00:25:05,852
You and him talked
about it a lot?

526
00:25:07,854 --> 00:25:09,029
A really special kid.

527
00:25:09,159 --> 00:25:10,857
Yeah, that's Matty.

528
00:25:10,987 --> 00:25:13,033
Yeah.

529
00:25:13,163 --> 00:25:15,949
You must've seen him in
One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest.

530
00:25:16,079 --> 00:25:17,864
He was really good in that.

531
00:25:20,344 --> 00:25:22,869
I, uh, no, I cou...
You know, I couldn't actually,

532
00:25:22,999 --> 00:25:25,959
unfortunately was not able
to see him in that.

533
00:25:26,089 --> 00:25:29,005
- I work a lot, um, nights.
- Oh, yeah.

534
00:25:29,136 --> 00:25:30,505
- Yeah, lots of long hours...
- He was really good.

535
00:25:30,529 --> 00:25:32,008
- I heard he was really good.
- Yeah.

536
00:25:32,139 --> 00:25:33,183
How is Matty?

537
00:25:41,278 --> 00:25:43,933
I'm going to actually take this.

538
00:25:44,064 --> 00:25:44,847
Oh, sure.

539
00:25:44,978 --> 00:25:45,978
If that's...

540
00:25:50,461 --> 00:25:51,593
Thanks.

541
00:26:06,216 --> 00:26:07,280
That ticker tape, oh,
just flick, flick it that way.

542
00:26:07,304 --> 00:26:09,306
It's got those spikes.

543
00:26:09,437 --> 00:26:11,134
Good morning everyone.

544
00:26:11,265 --> 00:26:12,919
Can I have
your attention, please.

545
00:26:13,049 --> 00:26:15,051
As you are all aware,

546
00:26:15,182 --> 00:26:18,402
Miss Dhawan is
on a leave of absence.

547
00:26:18,533 --> 00:26:21,754
While she is away,
we have secured a substitute.

548
00:26:21,884 --> 00:26:23,930
Her name is Alis Willmore.

549
00:26:24,060 --> 00:26:26,976
If you'd like to maybe
introduce yourselves to her,

550
00:26:27,107 --> 00:26:29,413
uh, that would be a great way
to start this meeting.

551
00:26:29,544 --> 00:26:31,415
Hi, I'm Anna.

552
00:26:31,546 --> 00:26:33,069
Hi, Anna.

553
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:33,983
Nice to meet you.

554
00:26:34,114 --> 00:26:36,507
Oh, yeah.
Nice to meet you.

555
00:26:36,638 --> 00:26:37,465
Anna's the school counselor.

556
00:26:37,596 --> 00:26:38,379
I'm the school counselor, yeah.

557
00:26:38,509 --> 00:26:39,509
Oh, great.

558
00:26:40,903 --> 00:26:42,818
John Peters, security.

559
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:45,080
- Hi.
- Hi.

560
00:26:50,130 --> 00:26:51,914
Uh, Peter, I'm new here,

561
00:26:52,045 --> 00:26:54,090
I'm actually teaching
American History.

562
00:26:54,221 --> 00:26:55,091
Oh, great.
Nice to meet you.

563
00:26:55,222 --> 00:26:56,222
Nice to meet you.

564
00:26:58,355 --> 00:27:01,315
I'm Jamie Freeman.
English. Welcome.

565
00:27:01,445 --> 00:27:02,621
Thank you.

566
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:09,105
- Oh, this is, uh...
- Tomas.

567
00:27:09,236 --> 00:27:11,281
Uh, Tomas, he's the art teacher.

568
00:27:11,412 --> 00:27:12,412
- Oh, hi.
- Hi.

569
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:14,415
I'm Alis.
Nice to meet you.

570
00:27:14,545 --> 00:27:15,242
Nice to meet you too.

571
00:27:15,372 --> 00:27:17,331
I'm Karen, the school nurse.

572
00:27:17,461 --> 00:27:19,246
- Hi.
- Hi, would you like a cookie?

573
00:27:19,376 --> 00:27:20,769
Oh, I'm okay, thank you.

574
00:27:20,900 --> 00:27:22,031
I'll have a cookie.

575
00:27:22,162 --> 00:27:23,990
Okay, everyone
is welcome to cookies.

576
00:27:25,339 --> 00:27:26,339
Not all at once.

577
00:27:27,733 --> 00:27:30,605
How you doing,
Coach Randall, Phys Ed.

578
00:27:30,736 --> 00:27:33,521
I'm Adam, uh,
teaching a dead language

579
00:27:33,652 --> 00:27:35,436
to kids with no attention span.

580
00:27:35,566 --> 00:27:36,829
- It's an uphill battle.
- Nice.

581
00:27:38,526 --> 00:27:39,526
You in the union?

582
00:27:41,007 --> 00:27:43,183
- I'm sorry?
- Are you in the union?

583
00:27:43,313 --> 00:27:44,313
Um, no.

584
00:27:44,358 --> 00:27:46,839
Jason Phillips, also science.

585
00:27:46,969 --> 00:27:48,536
She's not.

586
00:27:48,667 --> 00:27:50,320
- I'm, I mean I can join...
- Figures.

587
00:27:50,451 --> 00:27:52,148
If that's...

588
00:27:52,279 --> 00:27:53,648
- Oh, my God, lighten up!
- That's not the point.

589
00:27:53,672 --> 00:27:56,544
Yeah, I'll take this in stride.

590
00:27:56,675 --> 00:27:57,956
- Of all days, of all days.
- All right, no problem.

591
00:27:57,980 --> 00:27:59,068
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

592
00:27:59,199 --> 00:28:00,611
- Your job's not on the line.
- Thank you again.

593
00:28:00,635 --> 00:28:04,465
Again, I appreciate you
welcoming Miss Willmore.

594
00:28:04,595 --> 00:28:06,275
- Thanks, Jess.
- That's the second course.

595
00:28:08,382 --> 00:28:09,252
- I'm having trouble...
- Thanks.

596
00:28:09,383 --> 00:28:11,167
Got your class list here.

597
00:28:11,298 --> 00:28:12,778
You might wanna go
through these kids.

598
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:15,563
There's some goodies
and some baddies.

599
00:28:15,694 --> 00:28:17,696
Alex Imparato, he's a nice kid.

600
00:28:18,653 --> 00:28:21,264
Tom Smith is, uh, so-so.

601
00:28:22,570 --> 00:28:23,570
In this street?

602
00:28:24,833 --> 00:28:27,227
This street, thanks.
Thanks. Happy new year.

603
00:28:27,357 --> 00:28:29,316
Uh, Karla Smart is anything but.

604
00:28:29,446 --> 00:28:33,276
Uh, Joe's nice,
and Toni McKenna's nice.

605
00:28:33,407 --> 00:28:36,323
Ray, just stay away
from Ray at all costs.

606
00:28:36,453 --> 00:28:38,194
You know, avoid him
in the hallways.

607
00:28:39,805 --> 00:28:41,458
No, he's all right,
he's all right.

608
00:28:41,589 --> 00:28:43,896
Meghan, uh, is a beautiful girl.

609
00:28:44,026 --> 00:28:45,026
This is helpful.

610
00:28:45,071 --> 00:28:45,941
- Okay.
- What?

611
00:28:46,072 --> 00:28:47,092
No, this is the faculty room,

612
00:28:47,116 --> 00:28:48,528
- we can say whatever we want.
- I know.

613
00:28:48,552 --> 00:28:49,902
Let me find the Tylenol.

614
00:28:53,209 --> 00:28:56,996
Oh, geez, just take three,
or how many, four is good.

615
00:28:57,126 --> 00:28:59,085
You can change it,
you can change it.

616
00:29:00,826 --> 00:29:04,090
Hey, I'm gonna have
to ask you to leave.

617
00:29:04,220 --> 00:29:05,284
I've got the big meeting
coming up.

618
00:29:05,308 --> 00:29:07,180
I've gotta clear everything out.

619
00:29:07,310 --> 00:29:10,226
Oh, sure, yeah.
I'm done anyway.

620
00:29:10,357 --> 00:29:12,968
Oh, yeah? You okay?

621
00:29:13,099 --> 00:29:15,014
Yeah.

622
00:29:15,144 --> 00:29:17,233
What you drinking there,
something strong?

623
00:29:18,321 --> 00:29:19,366
What is it, tea?

624
00:29:19,496 --> 00:29:20,367
Tea.

625
00:29:20,497 --> 00:29:21,498
Love tea.

626
00:29:23,457 --> 00:29:24,457
Are you...

627
00:29:26,329 --> 00:29:27,853
I mean, you have
an English accent.

628
00:29:29,245 --> 00:29:30,420
Oh, right.
Well. I am, uh...

629
00:29:32,161 --> 00:29:34,001
I am from London.
I moved over a few years ago.

630
00:29:37,036 --> 00:29:38,036
And you?

631
00:29:39,212 --> 00:29:41,605
Oh, I've never,
I've never been to London, no.

632
00:29:41,736 --> 00:29:42,976
That's not really what I meant.

633
00:29:44,043 --> 00:29:45,131
Well, I don't know.

634
00:29:45,261 --> 00:29:46,785
Yeah, we can, sure.

635
00:29:49,788 --> 00:29:51,180
- We can?
- Get a coffee,

636
00:29:51,311 --> 00:29:52,791
you know, it's all good.

637
00:29:56,751 --> 00:29:59,275
Isn't that, you've been...

638
00:29:59,406 --> 00:30:01,103
- No, I'm...
- staring at me, I was...

639
00:30:02,888 --> 00:30:04,628
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
My mistake.

640
00:30:04,759 --> 00:30:07,109
You have a good, um...

641
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:08,783
- You have a good afternoon.
- It was just...

642
00:30:08,807 --> 00:30:10,112
It was just a misunderstanding.

643
00:30:10,243 --> 00:30:11,243
Okay.

644
00:30:12,593 --> 00:30:13,744
- Do you got enough?
- Yeah, thanks.

645
00:30:13,768 --> 00:30:14,595
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

646
00:30:14,725 --> 00:30:17,250
All right, um, great.

647
00:30:17,380 --> 00:30:18,980
You helped out
that kid yesterday, right?

648
00:30:20,296 --> 00:30:21,296
How's he doin'? Is...

649
00:30:22,821 --> 00:30:23,647
is he gonna make it, or...

650
00:30:23,778 --> 00:30:26,476
Um... I don't know.

651
00:30:46,714 --> 00:30:48,803
Everything's gonna be okay.

652
00:30:48,934 --> 00:30:50,374
Everything's gonna
be fine, you know.

653
00:30:52,415 --> 00:30:53,415
No, it's not.

654
00:30:55,288 --> 00:30:57,725
That's just something
that people say.

655
00:30:57,856 --> 00:31:00,859
Like, that they don't
mean it, do they, right?

656
00:31:00,989 --> 00:31:02,949
I really don't understand
why, like, everything...

657
00:31:03,992 --> 00:31:06,125
Nothing, nothing's
gonna be okay, right.

658
00:31:06,255 --> 00:31:07,798
I mean, nothing's
gonna be okay for the kid.

659
00:31:07,822 --> 00:31:09,342
Nothing's gonna be okay
for his family.

660
00:31:09,389 --> 00:31:10,869
Nothing's gonna be okay for me.

661
00:31:10,999 --> 00:31:13,697
I'm tired of people saying
things are gonna be all right.

662
00:31:13,828 --> 00:31:16,352
I don't like having,
living in this place

663
00:31:16,483 --> 00:31:18,504
where we're not really relating,
do you know what I'm saying?

664
00:31:18,528 --> 00:31:20,356
Everyone's talking
to each other,

665
00:31:20,487 --> 00:31:22,184
and they're trying
to talk to each other,

666
00:31:22,315 --> 00:31:23,988
but they're not really talking
to each other.

667
00:31:24,012 --> 00:31:26,362
I don't wanna do anything
that's superficial stuff

668
00:31:26,493 --> 00:31:28,297
with people, tell me
everything's gonna be all right,

669
00:31:28,321 --> 00:31:30,714
people change.
People don't fucking change!

670
00:31:30,845 --> 00:31:32,445
- Yeah, they do change.
- No, they don't!

671
00:31:32,499 --> 00:31:33,911
- People change.
- They just stay the same.

672
00:31:33,935 --> 00:31:35,328
You have to accept them
or just...

673
00:31:35,458 --> 00:31:36,738
Why would you
just say that to me

674
00:31:36,807 --> 00:31:38,548
when you don't even know, right?

675
00:31:38,679 --> 00:31:39,854
Why would you say that...

676
00:31:39,985 --> 00:31:41,223
I could've done
something different

677
00:31:41,247 --> 00:31:43,007
when I don't... I think
that I couldn't have done

678
00:31:43,031 --> 00:31:45,207
something different,
and I'm sorry that I didn't,

679
00:31:45,338 --> 00:31:46,881
and I tried to do it,
and that's the only thing

680
00:31:46,905 --> 00:31:48,145
that I can go on at this point.

681
00:31:48,210 --> 00:31:49,298
I tried to do what I...

682
00:31:49,429 --> 00:31:51,735
I tried to do what I could,

683
00:31:51,866 --> 00:31:54,129
and that was all
I could do at that moment.

684
00:31:55,435 --> 00:31:57,219
Not, not now. Not now.

685
00:31:59,830 --> 00:32:00,875
Sorry.

686
00:32:01,006 --> 00:32:03,138
That was a lot
in a short amount of time.

687
00:32:03,269 --> 00:32:04,400
You're good to go.

688
00:32:04,531 --> 00:32:05,749
I'm right down the,

689
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:07,360
right down the hall.

690
00:32:07,490 --> 00:32:11,277
If you need anything, you can
interrupt my class at any time.

691
00:32:11,407 --> 00:32:13,105
I would welcome that.

692
00:32:13,235 --> 00:32:14,235
Good to know.

693
00:32:33,473 --> 00:32:34,473
What are you doing here?

694
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:38,869
And why aren't you in Chicago?

695
00:32:40,567 --> 00:32:43,309
Hello, I'm lookin' for,
uh, the principal, Jefferson,

696
00:32:43,439 --> 00:32:45,485
No Williamson,
Jessie Williamson.

697
00:32:45,615 --> 00:32:46,703
Principal Williamson?

698
00:32:46,834 --> 00:32:47,661
Yes.

699
00:32:47,791 --> 00:32:49,750
Uh, hi, I'm Sebastian Summer.

700
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:52,448
I'm the guy that
they sent from Central.

701
00:32:52,579 --> 00:32:54,513
- We talked on the phone.
- Oh, right, yes, Sebastian.

702
00:32:54,537 --> 00:32:56,080
- Oh, you remembered me?
- Yes, on the phone. Right.

703
00:32:56,104 --> 00:32:58,280
- That makes me feel so good.
- Yes, please.

704
00:32:58,411 --> 00:32:59,910
I'm not much,
but I'm all I think about.

705
00:32:59,934 --> 00:33:01,283
How you doin', man?

706
00:33:01,414 --> 00:33:02,545
I've been better.

707
00:33:02,676 --> 00:33:04,286
I know. Here,
let's shake hands again.

708
00:33:04,417 --> 00:33:06,337
It's gonna be all right.
It's gonna be all right.

709
00:33:08,247 --> 00:33:09,378
Have a seat, please.

710
00:33:13,382 --> 00:33:14,818
This ain't gonna work.

711
00:33:14,949 --> 00:33:17,647
- Okay.
- So I have a solution.

712
00:33:17,778 --> 00:33:22,043
I don't like any of the chairs
in, in our system.

713
00:33:22,174 --> 00:33:26,482
They're all sort of built
to encourage too much comfort.

714
00:33:26,613 --> 00:33:29,572
You know, my philosophy is
not too tight, not too loose.

715
00:33:30,965 --> 00:33:32,488
So I'm gonna sit on my yoga mat.

716
00:33:32,619 --> 00:33:33,707
- Okay.
- Okay,

717
00:33:33,837 --> 00:33:34,664
Don't worry.
It's not a big deal.

718
00:33:34,795 --> 00:33:37,319
Oh, that.

719
00:33:38,668 --> 00:33:40,583
Does that sound more
like Jingle Bells,

720
00:33:40,714 --> 00:33:42,237
or does it sound more like

721
00:33:42,368 --> 00:33:44,283
a technique
for raising ghosts up

722
00:33:44,413 --> 00:33:46,502
from, like,
an underworld ghost river?

723
00:33:47,634 --> 00:33:48,635
Uh...

724
00:33:50,724 --> 00:33:51,875
- the ghost river?
- Yes baby,

725
00:33:51,899 --> 00:33:53,944
that's what I'm talkin' about.

726
00:33:54,075 --> 00:33:55,294
I live pretty far away.

727
00:33:55,424 --> 00:33:57,470
Uh, last stop on the 3 train.

728
00:33:57,600 --> 00:33:59,428
- It's a trek.
- Wow, that's really far.

729
00:33:59,559 --> 00:34:01,735
Yeah, I get to
school late most of the time.

730
00:34:01,865 --> 00:34:04,955
I try to get on time,
but I'm not motivated

731
00:34:05,086 --> 00:34:06,646
to come to school but,
you know, who is?

732
00:34:08,916 --> 00:34:11,116
- Sure, like, you're not even...
- You're not motivated?

733
00:34:12,354 --> 00:34:13,354
- Yes.
- Who are you?

734
00:34:14,835 --> 00:34:15,835
I...

735
00:34:17,185 --> 00:34:18,825
- Who are you looking for?
- Where's Jess?

736
00:34:19,100 --> 00:34:21,494
- Jess?
- Uh, he's the principal.

737
00:34:21,624 --> 00:34:23,017
Who are you?

738
00:34:23,148 --> 00:34:25,280
He, um...
Uh, he moved down the hall,

739
00:34:25,411 --> 00:34:26,411
another office for today.

740
00:34:27,326 --> 00:34:28,631
Why'd he move down the hall?

741
00:34:28,762 --> 00:34:30,131
He, he's just been
temporarily relocated.

742
00:34:30,155 --> 00:34:31,435
Why are you sitting
in his chair?

743
00:34:31,547 --> 00:34:33,332
That's where the principal sits.

744
00:34:33,462 --> 00:34:34,855
Well, Jess is still
the principal.

745
00:34:34,985 --> 00:34:36,093
He's in a temporary location.

746
00:34:36,117 --> 00:34:38,946
I expect that the, uh, secretary

747
00:34:39,077 --> 00:34:41,818
or maybe security
could direct you

748
00:34:41,949 --> 00:34:45,083
to his... present location.

749
00:34:51,306 --> 00:34:52,916
I study Shamanism.

750
00:34:53,047 --> 00:34:55,049
Don't worry. I'm not here to,

751
00:34:55,180 --> 00:34:57,573
you know, do any magic
or anything.

752
00:34:57,704 --> 00:35:01,186
You're un...
you're unzipped. Just, sorry.

753
00:35:02,796 --> 00:35:03,947
That's okay.
Thank you. Thank...

754
00:35:03,971 --> 00:35:06,104
Good lookin' out as they say.

755
00:35:06,234 --> 00:35:09,150
All right, this is
my Grateful Dead tie.

756
00:35:09,281 --> 00:35:11,544
The Grateful Dead tie is
for one kinda conversation,

757
00:35:11,674 --> 00:35:13,763
and this is my Thunderbird tie.

758
00:35:13,894 --> 00:35:16,046
I didn't know what kinda
conversation we were gonna have,

759
00:35:16,070 --> 00:35:17,470
but I can tell
this is gonna be more

760
00:35:17,506 --> 00:35:19,029
of a Thunderbird conversation,

761
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:20,398
- so that's, that's good.
- Yeah, I think so.

762
00:35:20,422 --> 00:35:22,598
Don't worry about me.
I'm here for one reason

763
00:35:22,729 --> 00:35:23,904
and one reason only.

764
00:35:24,034 --> 00:35:26,515
I've been a principal
for six years.

765
00:35:26,646 --> 00:35:28,300
The superintendent called me up,

766
00:35:28,430 --> 00:35:29,953
the chancellor called me up.

767
00:35:30,084 --> 00:35:31,738
Okay? These people know me well.

768
00:35:31,868 --> 00:35:33,305
I'm only here for one thing,

769
00:35:33,435 --> 00:35:35,829
and that is to get your back.

770
00:35:35,959 --> 00:35:37,396
I'm a brother principal, baby.

771
00:35:39,049 --> 00:35:40,747
- Great.
- What's happening?

772
00:35:40,877 --> 00:35:41,617
- Oh, Miss Williamson.
- Who are those people

773
00:35:41,748 --> 00:35:42,879
in Jess' office?

774
00:35:43,010 --> 00:35:45,012
Um, oh, we, we had an accident.

775
00:35:45,143 --> 00:35:46,883
Those are the investigators...

776
00:35:47,014 --> 00:35:48,122
Did Jess do something wrong?

777
00:35:48,146 --> 00:35:49,340
- No, no, no, no.
- Is he okay?

778
00:35:49,364 --> 00:35:51,061
No, he didn't do...
They, they just have,

779
00:35:51,192 --> 00:35:52,976
they have to do
a report, that's all.

780
00:35:53,107 --> 00:35:56,023
You have the parents
coming at what time?

781
00:35:56,154 --> 00:35:57,459
- Three.
- Three?

782
00:35:57,590 --> 00:35:59,505
Yeah, yeah.
They're all coming.

783
00:35:59,635 --> 00:36:01,550
All right, so we have some time.

784
00:36:01,681 --> 00:36:03,944
Here's what I wanna say to you.

785
00:36:04,074 --> 00:36:06,773
Ninety percent of
what's goin' on with the kids

786
00:36:06,903 --> 00:36:09,254
isn't about the kids,
it's what adults are projecting

787
00:36:09,384 --> 00:36:11,169
on the kids, okay?

788
00:36:11,299 --> 00:36:13,736
Parents in America
who feel that their children

789
00:36:13,867 --> 00:36:15,869
are entitled
to all kinds of things,

790
00:36:15,999 --> 00:36:18,872
whether it's private
or public or whatever, okay?

791
00:36:19,002 --> 00:36:21,396
Children themselves that think
that they should be getting

792
00:36:21,527 --> 00:36:23,047
everything they want
when they want it.

793
00:36:23,137 --> 00:36:25,487
And if they don't get it,
it's somebody's fault.

794
00:36:25,618 --> 00:36:26,812
How do your parents
feel about you

795
00:36:26,836 --> 00:36:28,534
being late to school every day?

796
00:36:28,664 --> 00:36:30,449
They don't care.
I get good grades,

797
00:36:30,579 --> 00:36:32,581
so they don't really
bother me too much.

798
00:36:32,712 --> 00:36:33,952
'Cause you're top of the class.

799
00:36:34,061 --> 00:36:34,931
Top of the school.

800
00:36:35,062 --> 00:36:36,455
Top of the school.

801
00:36:38,326 --> 00:36:40,328
Do you do well
in Miss Dhawan's class?

802
00:36:40,459 --> 00:36:41,677
Yeah, it's not much work.

803
00:36:43,070 --> 00:36:44,811
Okay, so you're the brain,

804
00:36:44,941 --> 00:36:47,944
J.C. tries, Matty's the clown,
Matty's the actor,

805
00:36:48,075 --> 00:36:49,879
- Matty's the... He's the leader.
- No, no. He's the...

806
00:36:49,903 --> 00:36:51,272
I mean like, we're all
pretty much leaders.

807
00:36:51,296 --> 00:36:54,429
You're in New York City,
public education,

808
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:56,866
1.1 million kids,

809
00:36:56,997 --> 00:37:00,609
in America, at a time

810
00:37:00,740 --> 00:37:04,222
when public education
is under attack.

811
00:37:04,352 --> 00:37:05,808
You're living at a time
when the country's

812
00:37:05,832 --> 00:37:07,747
in total upheaval,
and you're a principal

813
00:37:07,877 --> 00:37:09,314
in the very midst of it.

814
00:37:09,444 --> 00:37:11,141
You're a warrior.

815
00:37:11,272 --> 00:37:12,882
Why did he have
to leave his office?

816
00:37:14,057 --> 00:37:15,102
Why don't you sit down?

817
00:37:15,233 --> 00:37:16,433
Is it nice where they have him?

818
00:37:16,495 --> 00:37:17,670
Like, is it...

819
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:19,933
I guess so. I mean,
he's the principal, so...

820
00:37:20,063 --> 00:37:21,456
Yeah, he's the principal.

821
00:37:21,587 --> 00:37:23,632
I-I got a kid who's in the ICU,

822
00:37:23,763 --> 00:37:25,243
burns over half of his body.

823
00:37:25,373 --> 00:37:28,071
I've got SEI talking
to everybody in this school.

824
00:37:28,202 --> 00:37:30,987
I've got a thousand parents
coming that got an email

825
00:37:31,118 --> 00:37:32,728
that said a kid had been burned.

826
00:37:32,859 --> 00:37:34,948
So they all think
it could be theirs.

827
00:37:35,078 --> 00:37:37,864
Now, I've gotta meet them
in an hour and a half

828
00:37:37,994 --> 00:37:39,692
and let them know what happened.

829
00:37:39,822 --> 00:37:42,303
Even if it's not their kid,
which they know by now,

830
00:37:42,434 --> 00:37:45,567
they know that something could
easily happen in this school

831
00:37:45,698 --> 00:37:47,298
that could get
their kid in the hospital.

832
00:37:48,657 --> 00:37:49,963
All right, are you worried

833
00:37:50,093 --> 00:37:51,443
that they might just throw

834
00:37:51,573 --> 00:37:52,637
- your ass out on the corner?
- Yeah, absolutely, yes.

835
00:37:52,661 --> 00:37:54,576
Okay.

836
00:37:54,707 --> 00:37:56,274
I failed. I...
What if they fire me?

837
00:37:56,404 --> 00:37:57,840
Well,
she's so insecure, you know.

838
00:37:57,971 --> 00:37:59,078
Do you get the feeling she wants

839
00:37:59,102 --> 00:38:00,102
the students to like her?

840
00:38:00,147 --> 00:38:02,192
Yeah, I mean,

841
00:38:02,323 --> 00:38:03,563
she does it all wrong, you know.

842
00:38:03,672 --> 00:38:06,675
Like, you don't say,
this is fun, guys, you know,

843
00:38:06,806 --> 00:38:08,764
before you do a fun experiment,
you know.

844
00:38:08,895 --> 00:38:10,157
She's not cool.

845
00:38:10,288 --> 00:38:12,072
No, she's not cool.

846
00:38:12,202 --> 00:38:14,466
They don't fire you
over something like this.

847
00:38:15,989 --> 00:38:18,818
Yeah, there you go.
Sit up. Shit.

848
00:38:18,948 --> 00:38:20,143
You can't be lookin'
like some guy

849
00:38:20,167 --> 00:38:21,647
who's been completely deflated.

850
00:38:23,083 --> 00:38:24,345
Matter of fact...

851
00:38:25,607 --> 00:38:27,087
let's change seats.

852
00:38:28,349 --> 00:38:29,709
Maybe I should sit
on the yoga mat.

853
00:38:31,178 --> 00:38:32,440
Come on, baby. Let's switch.

854
00:38:33,746 --> 00:38:35,095
Your husband, he's, um...

855
00:38:35,225 --> 00:38:38,098
No, no, no. He's really
not my husband technically.

856
00:38:38,228 --> 00:38:39,578
I mean, the divorce isn't final,

857
00:38:39,708 --> 00:38:40,579
but he probably
wouldn't like it if...

858
00:38:40,709 --> 00:38:42,208
Okay, well,
would you like to sit down?

859
00:38:42,232 --> 00:38:43,538
Okay.

860
00:38:43,669 --> 00:38:44,844
Can I get you anything?

861
00:38:44,974 --> 00:38:47,150
Thank you, yes. Water.

862
00:38:47,281 --> 00:38:48,978
Yeah, yeah. Uh, one sec.

863
00:38:53,243 --> 00:38:54,636
Has the UFT been in touch?

864
00:38:55,942 --> 00:38:56,942
Yeah.

865
00:38:56,986 --> 00:38:58,066
Okay, what's their problem?

866
00:38:59,815 --> 00:39:00,815
Lots of things.

867
00:39:02,470 --> 00:39:04,405
Ever since the evaluations,
they've been up my ass.

868
00:39:04,429 --> 00:39:06,953
Yeah, I heard about that.

869
00:39:07,083 --> 00:39:08,650
How'd that go for you?

870
00:39:08,781 --> 00:39:11,392
You introduced
your own teacher evaluation

871
00:39:11,523 --> 00:39:15,004
at a time when teachers are
getting tons of evaluations

872
00:39:15,135 --> 00:39:18,921
rained down upon them
like drone strikes.

873
00:39:19,052 --> 00:39:20,052
All right, maybe it wasn't

874
00:39:20,140 --> 00:39:21,576
the best idea, I don't know.

875
00:39:21,707 --> 00:39:23,230
Hey, it's an innocent,
honest mistake.

876
00:39:23,361 --> 00:39:25,101
Don't ever do that again.

877
00:39:25,232 --> 00:39:27,513
I just don't think I have them
on my side right now, so...

878
00:39:28,714 --> 00:39:31,064
You don't have them
on your side.

879
00:39:31,194 --> 00:39:32,761
You know what? Join the club.

880
00:39:32,892 --> 00:39:35,198
Public education, man.

881
00:39:35,329 --> 00:39:39,725
It's nobody's fault
and everybody's responsibility.

882
00:39:39,855 --> 00:39:42,597
And everybody's gonna be
happy, joyful, and free

883
00:39:42,728 --> 00:39:44,425
as long as everybody
covers their ass.

884
00:39:45,905 --> 00:39:47,733
Now, did you look
at her curriculum?

885
00:39:47,863 --> 00:39:49,406
Yes, of course
I looked at her curriculum.

886
00:39:49,430 --> 00:39:50,710
Did you look
at her lesson plans?

887
00:39:50,823 --> 00:39:52,302
Yes, I looked
at her lesson plans.

888
00:39:52,433 --> 00:39:54,153
Are you in a relationship
with this teacher?

889
00:39:54,217 --> 00:39:55,044
Absolutely not!

890
00:39:55,175 --> 00:39:57,003
Okay, then you have nothing

891
00:39:57,133 --> 00:39:57,873
- to worry about.
- She was getting harassed

892
00:39:58,004 --> 00:39:59,004
by students though.

893
00:40:00,093 --> 00:40:02,487
I called them in... as you do.

894
00:40:04,793 --> 00:40:07,100
One of the kids
was Matty Fairchild.

895
00:40:09,798 --> 00:40:11,234
That's dicey.

896
00:40:11,365 --> 00:40:13,715
He had a little
weird thing with Miss D.

897
00:40:13,846 --> 00:40:15,064
What?

898
00:40:15,195 --> 00:40:15,848
- Miss D?
- Yeah.

899
00:40:15,978 --> 00:40:17,042
Yeah, is that what you guys...

900
00:40:17,066 --> 00:40:18,372
Miss Dhawan.

901
00:40:18,503 --> 00:40:19,741
Yeah, yeah. Th-Th-That's...
that's what,

902
00:40:19,765 --> 00:40:21,205
that's what,
that's what we call her.

903
00:40:21,244 --> 00:40:22,637
Matty was who called her that.

904
00:40:22,768 --> 00:40:23,986
It sounds like a,

905
00:40:24,117 --> 00:40:25,224
- it's like a nickname.
- Yeah, I mean,

906
00:40:25,248 --> 00:40:25,945
he didn't like her very much.

907
00:40:26,075 --> 00:40:27,729
Any particular reason?

908
00:40:27,860 --> 00:40:29,900
No, I mean, he was always
upset at her because of...

909
00:40:30,950 --> 00:40:32,952
her getting a friend
of mine into trouble.

910
00:40:33,082 --> 00:40:36,216
She, she talked about J.C.

911
00:40:36,346 --> 00:40:37,870
Is this another...

912
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,151
- Another student.
- Classmate, okay.

913
00:40:39,175 --> 00:40:40,455
Yeah.
It's a good friend of ours.

914
00:40:40,568 --> 00:40:43,266
Talked about him getting
in trouble with his dad,

915
00:40:43,397 --> 00:40:47,096
and that was not cool, you know.

916
00:40:47,227 --> 00:40:48,726
- J.C. got in trouble...
- He didn't want them

917
00:40:48,750 --> 00:40:49,901
- to know, man!
- with his dad.

918
00:40:49,925 --> 00:40:51,205
- What the fuck?
- His dad, yeah.

919
00:40:51,318 --> 00:40:52,667
And Miss Dhawan talked about it?

920
00:40:52,798 --> 00:40:53,799
- Yeah, um...
- And that's

921
00:40:53,929 --> 00:40:55,931
a problem because?

922
00:40:56,062 --> 00:40:57,902
You don't wanna get
in trouble with J.C.'s dad.

923
00:40:59,152 --> 00:41:00,370
Is he violent?

924
00:41:00,501 --> 00:41:02,460
Oh, like, you know.

925
00:41:04,070 --> 00:41:05,811
And Miss Dhawan
brought it up to the school?

926
00:41:05,941 --> 00:41:08,204
Yeah, I mean,
she sort of noticed the...

927
00:41:08,335 --> 00:41:10,163
the... we sort of all, yeah.

928
00:41:10,293 --> 00:41:11,730
When was this?

929
00:41:11,860 --> 00:41:13,253
You have
to move your sits bones.

930
00:41:13,383 --> 00:41:15,211
Move, move your butt cheeks

931
00:41:15,342 --> 00:41:17,170
so that you are
on your sits bones.

932
00:41:17,300 --> 00:41:20,390
This is where we constantly
screw up in meditation as well.

933
00:41:20,521 --> 00:41:22,610
You need to be sitting
so that you can,

934
00:41:22,741 --> 00:41:23,916
you know, hold your seat,

935
00:41:24,046 --> 00:41:25,961
be uplifted.

936
00:41:26,092 --> 00:41:27,092
Take a nice breath.

937
00:41:31,184 --> 00:41:33,229
Not too tight, not too loose.

938
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:35,057
Breathing in...

939
00:41:35,188 --> 00:41:37,973
I absorb
all the deep, dark, ugly,

940
00:41:38,104 --> 00:41:40,149
black shit that's about
to happen from the parents.

941
00:41:41,499 --> 00:41:43,283
Breathing out...

942
00:41:43,413 --> 00:41:45,590
I let it all go.

943
00:41:48,027 --> 00:41:49,027
Breathing in...

944
00:41:51,117 --> 00:41:53,206
I take in all the deep,
dark, black,

945
00:41:53,336 --> 00:41:55,730
oily, thick shit
from the parents.

946
00:41:55,861 --> 00:41:58,167
Breathing out...

947
00:41:58,298 --> 00:41:59,517
I let it go.

948
00:42:00,909 --> 00:42:02,496
That look on your face
is a little scary.

949
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:04,913
Try to relax your face muscles.

950
00:42:05,044 --> 00:42:06,132
Yes, relax.

951
00:42:06,262 --> 00:42:07,873
Look at those wrinkles disappear.

952
00:42:08,003 --> 00:42:09,527
Ah, you look five years younger.

953
00:42:11,267 --> 00:42:12,267
That easy, huh?

954
00:42:15,663 --> 00:42:18,971
Now, you were left alone
to handle all of that

955
00:42:19,101 --> 00:42:20,973
by yourself...

956
00:42:21,103 --> 00:42:23,018
you might,
you might make a mistake.

957
00:42:23,149 --> 00:42:25,630
I'm here to make sure
that you are good on that.

958
00:42:28,197 --> 00:42:29,982
You know what you need to do?

959
00:42:30,112 --> 00:42:32,985
You need to be out there
talkin' to your custodians.

960
00:42:33,115 --> 00:42:36,075
'Cause if lights go out
like that, that's some shit.

961
00:42:39,905 --> 00:42:41,820
You know?

962
00:42:41,950 --> 00:42:43,449
I don't know what's happening
in this school.

963
00:42:43,473 --> 00:42:44,126
- You're in charge...
- Jess.

964
00:42:44,257 --> 00:42:45,737
Of the custodians.

965
00:42:45,867 --> 00:42:47,347
Amy. Oh, my God, what?

966
00:42:47,477 --> 00:42:49,037
I woke up and you
weren't there and then

967
00:42:49,088 --> 00:42:50,350
I came here and then...

968
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:51,632
- Hello.
- they told me they wanted me

969
00:42:51,656 --> 00:42:53,222
to wait, but it wasn't
even your office.

970
00:42:53,353 --> 00:42:54,417
- This isn't your office.
- Wait, what happened?

971
00:42:54,441 --> 00:42:55,679
- Wait, wait, Amy.
- Babe, I'm so sorry.

972
00:42:55,703 --> 00:42:56,985
- Jesus Christ.
- Amy, what are you doing here?

973
00:42:57,009 --> 00:42:58,209
Sorry that this is your office.

974
00:42:58,314 --> 00:42:59,354
Amy,
what happened? What...

975
00:42:59,402 --> 00:43:00,186
Are you in trouble?

976
00:43:00,316 --> 00:43:02,014
In a minute,
he'll be gone, okay?

977
00:43:02,144 --> 00:43:03,885
- And this office is...
- Hey, uh, Jess.

978
00:43:04,016 --> 00:43:05,428
Is it all right if I
just leave my stuff here?

979
00:43:05,452 --> 00:43:06,540
Yeah, of course, of course.

980
00:43:06,671 --> 00:43:08,194
- Hello there.
- Just, could you just

981
00:43:08,324 --> 00:43:09,650
- sit down for me.
- She said they called,

982
00:43:09,674 --> 00:43:10,738
- called you my husband.
- Sit down, just come.

983
00:43:10,762 --> 00:43:11,913
I'll give you some privacy.
Don't worry.

984
00:43:11,937 --> 00:43:14,156
Everything's all right.
I gotta take my shoes.

985
00:43:14,287 --> 00:43:16,407
Otherwise, somebody's gonna
look at me like I'm crazy.

986
00:43:17,595 --> 00:43:19,727

00:44:32,582 --> 00:44:34,280
enough.

1011
00:44:34,410 --> 00:44:36,935
Paul, do I need
to throw you out of class?

1012
00:44:38,458 --> 00:44:40,286
Give me that. Give me that.

1013
00:44:46,248 --> 00:44:48,424
I do not wanna be throwing
anyone out of class.

1014
00:44:48,555 --> 00:44:49,904
We don't have that much time.

1015
00:44:50,035 --> 00:44:52,254
Please, eyes up here.
Eyes up here.

1016
00:44:52,385 --> 00:44:54,300
J.C., Matty.

1017
00:44:54,430 --> 00:44:56,737
Matty, Matty, settle down.

1018
00:44:58,217 --> 00:45:00,480
- What are you doin'?
- Oh!

1019
00:45:00,610 --> 00:45:03,178
It tastes gross.
It tastes gross.

1020
00:45:03,309 --> 00:45:04,547
Do I need
to separate the three of you?

1021
00:45:04,571 --> 00:45:05,651
In case you were wondering.

1022
00:45:05,703 --> 00:45:06,965
Enough, settle down.

1023
00:45:07,095 --> 00:45:08,967
I am giving you
till the count of three.

1024
00:45:09,097 --> 00:45:10,097
One.

1025
00:45:10,969 --> 00:45:11,969
Two.

1026
00:45:13,101 --> 00:45:14,494
Three.

1027
00:45:14,624 --> 00:45:15,624
Don't drink the Kool-Aid.

1028
00:45:15,669 --> 00:45:18,628
I got so wet, Miss D.

1029
00:45:18,759 --> 00:45:20,065
When the head game
is too strong.

1030
00:45:20,195 --> 00:45:21,283
Matty!

1031
00:45:22,589 --> 00:45:24,504
Enough, all right, enough.

1032
00:45:26,680 --> 00:45:28,726
Enough. Enough!

1033
00:45:30,379 --> 00:45:32,642
Guys, up here right now.

1034
00:45:32,773 --> 00:45:34,775
Or I swear to God,
you are all gonna fail.

1035
00:45:34,906 --> 00:45:37,212
What was the lesson plan
that you guys had last week?

1036
00:45:37,343 --> 00:45:38,126
There was none!

1037
00:45:38,257 --> 00:45:39,519
Yes, there was. Enough.

1038
00:45:39,649 --> 00:45:40,650
Could you grab me a glove?

1039
00:45:40,781 --> 00:45:41,564
Step back,
right now. I'm serious.

1040
00:45:41,695 --> 00:45:42,391
Step back right now.

1041
00:45:42,522 --> 00:45:44,350
Oh!

1042
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:46,265
Uh-oh,
the gas is on. Uh-oh!

1043
00:45:46,395 --> 00:45:48,702
J.C., take your
sunglasses off right now.

1044
00:45:48,833 --> 00:45:50,288
- I'm blind.
- Take your sunglasses off

1045
00:45:50,312 --> 00:45:51,966
- right now.
- He's blind, legally.

1046
00:45:52,097 --> 00:45:53,509
I'm trying to feel
my way around the room.

1047
00:45:53,533 --> 00:45:54,815
- I'm legally blind.
- Pay attention.

1048
00:45:54,839 --> 00:45:56,120
There are four different
elements, correct?

1049
00:45:56,144 --> 00:45:57,984
We're gonna see
four different colors, correct?

1050
00:45:58,756 --> 00:46:00,366
What is this experiment called?

1051
00:46:22,388 --> 00:46:23,388
Do I need a lawyer?

1052
00:46:23,476 --> 00:46:24,216
No, you don't need a lawyer.

1053
00:46:24,346 --> 00:46:26,218
Just be open
and honest with them

1054
00:46:26,348 --> 00:46:28,133
- about what happened.
- J.C. needs a lawyer.

1055
00:46:28,263 --> 00:46:29,743
Paul.

1056
00:46:29,874 --> 00:46:31,701
J.C., put your phone
away, please.

1057
00:46:31,832 --> 00:46:33,152
Why is Lawrence
near the end here?

1058
00:46:33,225 --> 00:46:35,575
I-I thought Johnson
came after Caraballo.

1059
00:46:35,705 --> 00:46:37,795
There's no logic
to it like that.

1060
00:46:37,925 --> 00:46:39,816
They just, they call in
everybody that was there,

1061
00:46:39,840 --> 00:46:41,363
and they try to get
to the bottom

1062
00:46:41,494 --> 00:46:42,558
of what happened, that's all.

1063
00:46:42,582 --> 00:46:43,757
There's the logic to it.

1064
00:46:43,888 --> 00:46:45,585
They bring in the person
who did it last.

1065
00:46:45,715 --> 00:46:47,108
You tryin'
to say somethin', Paul?

1066
00:46:47,239 --> 00:46:48,849
No, I'm not.
What are you tryin' to say?

1067
00:46:48,980 --> 00:46:50,609
I'm not saying anything. You're
the one that keeps talking.

1068
00:46:50,633 --> 00:46:52,473
- Get the fuck outta my face.
- Language, guys!

1069
00:46:52,592 --> 00:46:54,178
Someone's getting
pretty fuckin' defensive.

1070
00:46:54,202 --> 00:46:55,310
'Cause you keep fuckin' talkin'.

1071
00:46:55,334 --> 00:46:56,204
Man, go back to Mexico.

1072
00:46:56,335 --> 00:46:58,032
- Shut the fuck up.
- Oh!

1073
00:46:58,163 --> 00:46:59,033
Come on.

1074
00:46:59,164 --> 00:47:01,253
Stop it.
You are not...

1075
00:47:01,383 --> 00:47:02,404
I'm gonna fuckin' kill you!

1076
00:47:02,428 --> 00:47:03,646
Like you killed Matty!

1077
00:47:03,777 --> 00:47:05,344
Guys, that's enough.

1078
00:47:05,474 --> 00:47:06,084
Paul, calm down!

1079
00:47:06,214 --> 00:47:08,042
J.C.!

1080
00:47:08,173 --> 00:47:09,522
Guys, stop it!

1081
00:47:09,652 --> 00:47:13,265
Stop it, stop it.
Stop it right now.

1082
00:47:13,395 --> 00:47:14,435
- Get off of me.
- Stop it.

1083
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:18,618
Stop, please.
Cut it out. Stop it.

1084
00:47:18,748 --> 00:47:21,969
Stop, calm down.

1085
00:47:22,100 --> 00:47:22,709
Enough.

1086
00:47:22,840 --> 00:47:25,146
Enough! Please, enough.

1087
00:47:36,897 --> 00:47:38,333
Is that a man tree?

1088
00:47:38,464 --> 00:47:40,161
What?

1089
00:47:40,292 --> 00:47:41,467
Half man, half tree.

1090
00:47:45,166 --> 00:47:47,603
A man tree.

1091
00:47:47,734 --> 00:47:49,214
A man that grows into a tree?

1092
00:47:51,738 --> 00:47:53,609
He wants to save the world,

1093
00:47:53,740 --> 00:47:55,873
so he lets a tree grow in him.

1094
00:47:59,224 --> 00:48:01,313
You know, fire can destroy him.

1095
00:48:01,443 --> 00:48:02,575
Not the man tree,

1096
00:48:03,663 --> 00:48:05,012
'cause he's not human.

1097
00:48:07,667 --> 00:48:09,930
In his world,
fire does not exist.

1098
00:48:20,114 --> 00:48:21,114
It's cool.

1099
00:48:24,423 --> 00:48:25,423
You want it?

1100
00:48:26,555 --> 00:48:27,905
- Yeah.
- Yeah? It's yours.

1101
00:48:33,432 --> 00:48:34,432
Thank you.

1102
00:48:55,497 --> 00:48:57,543
Hey.

1103
00:48:57,673 --> 00:48:59,197
Always I find a coin.

1104
00:48:59,327 --> 00:49:01,286
- Always.
- You're getting rich.

1105
00:49:01,416 --> 00:49:02,741
- So, uh, how much is it?
- Every day.

1106
00:49:02,765 --> 00:49:04,419
14.50.

1107
00:49:04,550 --> 00:49:06,160
- Oh, shit.
- 14.50.

1108
00:49:06,291 --> 00:49:07,596
Do you have money because I,

1109
00:49:07,727 --> 00:49:10,904
I must have left it
in the hotel, shit.

1110
00:49:11,035 --> 00:49:12,906
What hotel are you staying at?

1111
00:49:13,037 --> 00:49:15,430
Uh, some hotel
close to the station.

1112
00:49:15,561 --> 00:49:16,561
Okay.

1113
00:49:17,606 --> 00:49:20,566
Anyway, I checked out.

1114
00:49:20,696 --> 00:49:22,568
I thought... Beautiful.

1115
00:49:22,698 --> 00:49:23,786
Thank you.

1116
00:49:23,917 --> 00:49:24,613
- Nice.
- Thank you, thank you.

1117
00:49:24,744 --> 00:49:26,311
- Thanks.
- You know...

1118
00:49:28,052 --> 00:49:30,532
I thought I could stay
at your place.

1119
00:49:30,663 --> 00:49:31,857
Oh, no, that's not
gonna be possible.

1120
00:49:31,881 --> 00:49:34,406
Why is it impossible, why?

1121
00:49:34,536 --> 00:49:36,536
What's going on with your,
uh, with your new joint?

1122
00:49:38,714 --> 00:49:39,715
I opened it.

1123
00:49:41,282 --> 00:49:42,414
Great. That's great.

1124
00:49:42,544 --> 00:49:43,544
No, it's not.

1125
00:49:43,632 --> 00:49:44,764
- No?
- I got out.

1126
00:49:44,894 --> 00:49:46,334
The whole nightclub
business is shit.

1127
00:49:48,028 --> 00:49:50,335
The truth is,
I, I trusted those men,

1128
00:49:50,465 --> 00:49:52,685
bad men, wrong men to trust.

1129
00:49:52,815 --> 00:49:53,991
Now, I'm in a bit of a hole.

1130
00:49:55,427 --> 00:49:57,559
Okay, so I can stay
at your place, huh?

1131
00:49:57,690 --> 00:49:59,344
No, I told you
I've got a girlfriend.

1132
00:49:59,474 --> 00:50:00,582
- It's not gonna work.
- You, you,

1133
00:50:00,606 --> 00:50:01,606
you have a girlfriend?

1134
00:50:01,694 --> 00:50:02,521
- Yeah.
- You have a girlfriend?

1135
00:50:02,651 --> 00:50:03,652
That changes everything.

1136
00:50:03,783 --> 00:50:05,567
Is she, is she hot?

1137
00:50:05,698 --> 00:50:07,328
Yeah, look, I'm gonna
call you later, okay?

1138
00:50:07,352 --> 00:50:09,267
You'll call me later when?

1139
00:50:09,397 --> 00:50:10,833
- You don't have my...
- Hey, hey!

1140
00:50:10,964 --> 00:50:12,705
- Hey!
- Wait, relax, wait...

1141
00:50:12,835 --> 00:50:13,836
- Get back here!
- Wait.

1142
00:50:13,967 --> 00:50:14,967
Calm down, please...

1143
00:50:15,055 --> 00:50:16,404
Oh, fuck off.
Get out of the way!

1144
00:50:16,535 --> 00:50:17,579
Okay, okay.

1145
00:50:17,710 --> 00:50:18,885
That motherfucker, I'm...

1146
00:50:19,016 --> 00:50:20,278
Okay, okay.

1147
00:50:20,408 --> 00:50:21,472
It's none of your
fucking business.

1148
00:50:21,496 --> 00:50:23,063
It is. He is my brother.

1149
00:50:24,586 --> 00:50:25,761
What is his name?

1150
00:50:25,892 --> 00:50:26,932
- What?
- What is his name?

1151
00:50:26,980 --> 00:50:28,416
- Adam.
- Adam what?

1152
00:50:28,547 --> 00:50:29,591
Adam Kazantzoglou.

1153
00:50:29,722 --> 00:50:30,984
- I'm gonna kill him.
- Why?

1154
00:50:31,115 --> 00:50:31,854
I'm gonna kill
your fuckin' brother.

1155
00:50:31,985 --> 00:50:33,247
What did he do?

1156
00:50:33,378 --> 00:50:34,988
He's selling drugs
to my daughter!

1157
00:50:35,119 --> 00:50:37,338
- She is 16 years old!
- Selling drugs?

1158
00:50:37,469 --> 00:50:38,557
- Selling drugs?
- Yes!

1159
00:50:38,687 --> 00:50:41,081
Shit. Okay, okay.

1160
00:50:41,995 --> 00:50:42,822
Be quiet. Okay.

1161
00:50:42,952 --> 00:50:44,171
Sixteen!

1162
00:50:45,912 --> 00:50:48,523
You want a cigarette?
You want a cigarette?

1163
00:50:48,654 --> 00:50:50,066
Get the fuck... No, I don't want
a fucking cigarette.

1164
00:50:50,090 --> 00:50:52,440
It's okay. He left.
He is gone now.

1165
00:50:52,571 --> 00:50:54,051
- He is my brother.
- I'm gonna kill

1166
00:50:54,181 --> 00:50:56,159
your fuckin' brother. I'm gonna
kill your fucking brother.

1167
00:50:56,183 --> 00:50:59,317
Okay, you are right.
I will kill him too.

1168
00:50:59,447 --> 00:51:00,535
Shit!

1169
00:51:05,497 --> 00:51:07,151
I'm gonna kill him.
I'm gonna kill him.

1170
00:51:08,717 --> 00:51:10,154
I'm gonna stop this.

1171
00:51:14,723 --> 00:51:17,161
He's selling drugs. I...

1172
00:51:20,512 --> 00:51:21,817
We have to tell the headmaster

1173
00:51:21,948 --> 00:51:23,254
what's happening in his school.

1174
00:51:23,384 --> 00:51:24,384
We have to stop this.

1175
00:51:25,517 --> 00:51:26,517
He's your brother?

1176
00:51:27,736 --> 00:51:29,173
He's your brother?

1177
00:51:34,526 --> 00:51:35,526
Hello?

1178
00:51:36,963 --> 00:51:38,660
Are you talkin' to me or...

1179
00:51:38,791 --> 00:51:39,791
Yeah, hi.

1180
00:51:39,835 --> 00:51:40,835
Hey.

1181
00:51:41,968 --> 00:51:43,288
Do... Are you
looking for someone?

1182
00:51:43,361 --> 00:51:43,926
Do you need something?

1183
00:51:44,057 --> 00:51:47,321
Um, so you're like a shrink.

1184
00:51:47,452 --> 00:51:49,252
Uh, well, I don't really like
to call it that.

1185
00:51:50,672 --> 00:51:51,804
You help people.

1186
00:51:51,934 --> 00:51:54,111
Oh, I try to.
That's the goal.

1187
00:51:55,851 --> 00:51:57,679
I wanna help people too.

1188
00:51:57,810 --> 00:51:59,377
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1189
00:51:59,507 --> 00:52:00,769
Working in the cafeteria?

1190
00:52:00,900 --> 00:52:01,901
Yeah, right.

1191
00:52:02,031 --> 00:52:04,556
I just do that to save up

1192
00:52:04,686 --> 00:52:07,298
to go to school to be like you.

1193
00:52:08,908 --> 00:52:10,518
I knew Matty.

1194
00:52:10,649 --> 00:52:11,649
How's he doin'?

1195
00:52:12,651 --> 00:52:13,826
He wanted to be an actor.

1196
00:52:13,956 --> 00:52:15,393
- He did?
- Yeah.

1197
00:52:15,523 --> 00:52:17,917
He, uh, was friends
with, um, Adam,

1198
00:52:18,047 --> 00:52:20,137
who works with me
in the cafeteria.

1199
00:52:20,267 --> 00:52:24,053
Um, he goes to acting school,
so they kinda hit it off,

1200
00:52:24,184 --> 00:52:25,838
and they had, like,
their own thing.

1201
00:52:25,968 --> 00:52:27,622
'Cause you know how actors are.

1202
00:52:27,753 --> 00:52:28,928
They have like their...

1203
00:52:29,058 --> 00:52:31,452
And they're just, um...
Adam actually...

1204
00:52:31,583 --> 00:52:33,454
well, he gave, um...

1205
00:52:35,978 --> 00:52:37,676
I gotta go back to work, so...

1206
00:52:40,722 --> 00:52:41,882
You, you're not gonna wake...

1207
00:52:41,984 --> 00:52:44,117
Olga, lis-listen to me.

1208
00:52:44,248 --> 00:52:46,119
Please, just listen
to me for a second.

1209
00:52:46,250 --> 00:52:47,947
- I know that this is hard...
- Ross.

1210
00:52:48,077 --> 00:52:49,644
But we really need
to go in there,

1211
00:52:49,775 --> 00:52:51,777
and we really need
some answers right now.

1212
00:52:51,907 --> 00:52:53,170
- Ross.
- Okay?

1213
00:52:53,300 --> 00:52:54,364
- Olga, please.
- We need to be with our son.

1214
00:52:54,388 --> 00:52:55,887
- I know we need to... I know.
- We need...

1215
00:52:55,911 --> 00:52:57,019
- Don't you wanna know?
- something that...

1216
00:52:57,043 --> 00:52:59,001
- I just, they're running late...
- Why?

1217
00:52:59,132 --> 00:53:00,805
Why? Do you think we're
gonna figure out why tonight?

1218
00:53:00,829 --> 00:53:02,546
Do you think we're gonna
figure out why anything?

1219
00:53:02,570 --> 00:53:04,311
Amy, we can't do this right now.

1220
00:53:04,442 --> 00:53:05,573
I gotta go to this meeting.

1221
00:53:05,704 --> 00:53:06,942
- I have to be there.
- I know, but I wanna just

1222
00:53:06,966 --> 00:53:09,011
tell you that I, I just,
I can't be alone right now.

1223
00:53:09,142 --> 00:53:10,230
Jess, I can't do it.

1224
00:53:20,066 --> 00:53:21,850
Can I help you find anything?

1225
00:53:21,981 --> 00:53:24,505
Are you the librarian too?

1226
00:53:24,636 --> 00:53:26,986
Why is he at
that school in the first place?

1227
00:53:27,116 --> 00:53:29,336
I wanted to send him
to Fieldston. Why is he there?

1228
00:53:29,467 --> 00:53:30,511
Where have you been?

1229
00:53:30,642 --> 00:53:31,749
When it's time
to do the homework,

1230
00:53:31,773 --> 00:53:32,968
- where have you been?
- I've... what do you mean?

1231
00:53:32,992 --> 00:53:33,732
I've been at work.
I've been busy.

1232
00:53:33,862 --> 00:53:34,863
Would you... don't...

1233
00:53:36,822 --> 00:53:39,128
Can we, can we...
Are you really

1234
00:53:39,259 --> 00:53:40,652
You're gonna blame, you're gonna

1235
00:53:40,782 --> 00:53:41,653
put all the blame on me now.

1236
00:53:41,783 --> 00:53:43,481
I'm so sorry.

1237
00:53:43,611 --> 00:53:45,874
I made a mistake. I'm so sorry.

1238
00:53:46,005 --> 00:53:47,645
How did we end up here?
I could've just...

1239
00:53:49,138 --> 00:53:51,160
How did we end up here?
How did we end up with Matty?

1240
00:53:51,184 --> 00:53:52,054
- I could've just...
- Are we really gonna

1241
00:53:52,185 --> 00:53:53,795
do this right now?

1242
00:53:53,926 --> 00:53:55,077
- You didn't even wanna have...
- Twenty minutes, can you ple...

1243
00:53:55,101 --> 00:53:56,121
You didn't even wanna have him!

1244
00:53:56,145 --> 00:53:57,385
You didn't even wanna have him.

1245
00:53:58,583 --> 00:53:59,758
Get the fuck outta here?

1246
00:53:59,888 --> 00:54:01,968
Are we really gonna have
this conversation right now?

1247
00:54:02,935 --> 00:54:04,632
I was a kid. I was Matty's age.

1248
00:54:04,763 --> 00:54:06,025
I was a kid.
I was young too.

1249
00:54:06,155 --> 00:54:07,220
We made this decision together.

1250
00:54:07,244 --> 00:54:09,289
I was young too.

1251
00:54:09,420 --> 00:54:11,100
Don't yell at me.
Don't yell on the street.

1252
00:54:11,160 --> 00:54:12,466
I'll fucking yell on the street

1253
00:54:12,597 --> 00:54:13,835
if I wanna yell
on the fuckin' street.

1254
00:54:13,859 --> 00:54:15,097
Don't yell at me.
Don't you yell at me.

1255
00:54:15,121 --> 00:54:16,383
Are you married? What's your...

1256
00:54:18,080 --> 00:54:19,560
- Uh, no, I'm not.
- Oh, okay.

1257
00:54:22,084 --> 00:54:22,955
What happened?

1258
00:54:23,085 --> 00:54:24,085
Why not?

1259
00:54:24,173 --> 00:54:25,523
Um, I don't know.

1260
00:54:25,653 --> 00:54:28,830
I've just had really bad luck
with men.

1261
00:54:28,961 --> 00:54:30,267
Really?

1262
00:54:30,397 --> 00:54:33,270
I was Matty's age
when we had this discussion.

1263
00:54:34,662 --> 00:54:36,055
You think I wanted to have a kid

1264
00:54:36,185 --> 00:54:37,641
- when I was that...
- I was young too.

1265
00:54:37,665 --> 00:54:39,711
My mom and my dad,
I love 'em both.

1266
00:54:39,841 --> 00:54:41,906
They made me. I just wish they
would've never stayed together.

1267
00:54:41,930 --> 00:54:44,039
They stayed together because
of me, but that was stupid

1268
00:54:44,063 --> 00:54:44,933
because I would have
preferred nothing more

1269
00:54:45,064 --> 00:54:46,631
than them being apart.

1270
00:54:46,761 --> 00:54:48,826
When I was younger, I used
to pray that they got divorced.

1271
00:54:48,850 --> 00:54:50,730
Matty's the best fucking thing
in my life, Olga.

1272
00:54:52,071 --> 00:54:54,029
Oh, I don't wanna yell.
I don't wanna yell!

1273
00:54:54,160 --> 00:54:56,728
Then I guess I got used
to it, or I stopped praying.

1274
00:54:56,858 --> 00:54:58,556
I don't wanna yell either, okay.

1275
00:54:58,686 --> 00:55:00,055
- I still love you.
- What about you?

1276
00:55:00,079 --> 00:55:01,341
Do you still love me?

1277
00:55:03,648 --> 00:55:05,302
Uh, I have uh, two kids.

1278
00:55:07,521 --> 00:55:08,783
Good to know.

1279
00:55:08,914 --> 00:55:10,872
I wish I could go back in time

1280
00:55:11,003 --> 00:55:12,613
and have a different outcome.

1281
00:55:12,744 --> 00:55:14,722
- I would have never...
- I meant, are you married?

1282
00:55:14,746 --> 00:55:16,400
Oh, oh, yeah.

1283
00:55:16,530 --> 00:55:17,575
- You are?
- Yes.

1284
00:55:17,705 --> 00:55:18,967
- Yes, yes.
- Oh.

1285
00:55:19,098 --> 00:55:20,317
- Okay.
- Yes, I am.

1286
00:55:21,666 --> 00:55:24,495
Um... well, yeah.
Well, I didn't, I didn't,

1287
00:55:24,625 --> 00:55:25,665
I didn't see a ring, so...

1288
00:55:26,888 --> 00:55:29,717
Yeah, well, I...
I don't believe in rings.

1289
00:55:29,848 --> 00:55:32,111
They're confining...

1290
00:55:32,241 --> 00:55:33,982
and I suffer
from claustrophobia.

1291
00:55:34,113 --> 00:55:35,767
Oh, I'm sorry.

1292
00:55:42,251 --> 00:55:43,383
Hello?

1293
00:55:53,915 --> 00:55:55,755
The world you see
is just a movie in your mind.

1294
00:55:58,137 --> 00:55:59,977
The world you see is just
a movie in your mind.

1295
00:56:01,793 --> 00:56:03,969
The world you see is just
a movie in your mind.

1296
00:56:06,798 --> 00:56:08,638
The world you see is just
a movie in your mind.

1297
00:56:10,105 --> 00:56:11,300
Let's make sure
the custodian set it up

1298
00:56:11,324 --> 00:56:13,674
and then the,
the papers for the parents,

1299
00:56:13,805 --> 00:56:14,806
and where do those go?

1300
00:56:14,936 --> 00:56:16,677
Like maybe on a table outside.

1301
00:56:16,808 --> 00:56:17,548
- Okay, all right.
- Parents can pick 'em up

1302
00:56:17,678 --> 00:56:18,678
as they walk in.

1303
00:56:18,766 --> 00:56:19,830
And when does that
have to happen?

1304
00:56:19,854 --> 00:56:21,290
Like, in 15 minutes.

1305
00:56:21,421 --> 00:56:23,902
Oh, okay, so I
better go do that.

1306
00:56:24,032 --> 00:56:25,338
- Thank you.
- Sure.

1307
00:56:25,469 --> 00:56:27,035
- I'm sorry.
- It's no problem, Jess.

1308
00:56:59,198 --> 00:57:00,068
Hello.

1309
00:57:00,199 --> 00:57:01,287
Hello.

1310
00:57:01,418 --> 00:57:04,421
My name is Nick Kazantzoglou,

1311
00:57:04,551 --> 00:57:07,032
and I would like to see
the headmaster, please.

1312
00:57:07,162 --> 00:57:08,242
Do you have an appointment?

1313
00:57:09,861 --> 00:57:11,819
No, but...

1314
00:57:11,950 --> 00:57:17,477
Kazantzoglou, K-A-Z-A-N-T-Z-O-G-L-O-U.

1315
00:57:17,608 --> 00:57:19,673
You need to have an appointment
to see the principal.

1316
00:57:19,697 --> 00:57:20,959
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

1317
00:57:21,089 --> 00:57:23,440
Uh, the gentleman is with me.

1318
00:57:23,570 --> 00:57:27,879
Um, I'm a parent, and, uh,
my name is David McKenna,

1319
00:57:28,009 --> 00:57:30,838
and, uh, I got an email
about a meeting,

1320
00:57:30,969 --> 00:57:33,188
uh, with the principal.

1321
00:57:33,319 --> 00:57:34,886
The meeting's in the afternoon.

1322
00:57:35,016 --> 00:57:37,149
Well, uh, well,
we're, we're early,

1323
00:57:37,279 --> 00:57:39,194
but we can,
we can wait if, if...

1324
00:57:39,325 --> 00:57:40,587
- McKenna?
- Yeah.

1325
00:57:44,330 --> 00:57:45,410
Can you give me one second?

1326
00:57:45,462 --> 00:57:46,506
Yeah, sure.

1327
00:57:48,508 --> 00:57:50,205
The gentleman is with me.

1328
00:57:50,336 --> 00:57:52,207
You sure know how to do things.

1329
00:57:57,343 --> 00:57:58,343
Um...

1330
00:58:00,172 --> 00:58:01,390
I'm sorry.

1331
00:58:01,521 --> 00:58:04,393
Uh, I can't, I can't let you in.

1332
00:58:04,524 --> 00:58:07,919
You're on a list of people
I can't let in.

1333
00:58:08,049 --> 00:58:09,287
Wait, what do you mean
you can't?

1334
00:58:09,311 --> 00:58:10,748
I'm, I'm a parent.

1335
00:58:10,878 --> 00:58:11,942
- I understand.
- David McKenna.

1336
00:58:11,966 --> 00:58:12,966
I understand.

1337
00:58:14,273 --> 00:58:15,642
I don't know
why you're on the list,

1338
00:58:15,666 --> 00:58:17,947
but you're gonna have to talk
to the principal about that.

1339
00:58:18,059 --> 00:58:19,515
Well, I'm here to talk
to the principal,

1340
00:58:19,539 --> 00:58:20,908
So if you can go get
the principal...

1341
00:58:20,932 --> 00:58:22,020
The principal's not here

1342
00:58:22,150 --> 00:58:23,171
- right now, sir.
- I'll talk to him right now.

1343
00:58:23,195 --> 00:58:23,891
I wanna see the list.

1344
00:58:24,022 --> 00:58:25,086
I can't show you the list, sir.

1345
00:58:25,110 --> 00:58:26,764
I wanna see the list.
Show me the list.

1346
00:58:26,894 --> 00:58:27,939
I can't show you...

1347
00:58:28,069 --> 00:58:29,351
- Sir, you're gonna have to...
- Show me the list.

1348
00:58:29,375 --> 00:58:30,395
I can't show you the list, sir.

1349
00:58:30,419 --> 00:58:31,571
Sir, you're gonna have
to calm down.

1350
00:58:31,595 --> 00:58:32,291
I wanna see the fucking
principal right now.

1351
00:58:32,421 --> 00:58:33,118
I'm gonna have
to ask you to leave.

1352
00:58:33,248 --> 00:58:34,815
Where are you going, sir?

1353
00:58:34,946 --> 00:58:35,686
- You're not going.
- [Joh Sir!

1354
00:58:35,816 --> 00:58:36,904
Calm down. Calm down.

1355
00:58:37,035 --> 00:58:38,395
Sir, I'm gonna
have to call this in

1356
00:58:38,427 --> 00:58:39,254
- if you don't leave.
- Call whoever you want!

1357
00:58:39,385 --> 00:58:40,821
I'm a parent here!

1358
00:58:40,952 --> 00:58:42,519
Okay, okay, okay.

1359
00:58:48,568 --> 00:58:50,875
Fucking restraining order on me!

1360
00:58:51,005 --> 00:58:52,050
Ah! I can't...

1361
00:58:52,180 --> 00:58:54,008
She put me on a fucking list!

1362
00:58:54,139 --> 00:58:55,159
You know what?
I'm gonna go back in there...

1363
00:58:55,183 --> 00:58:57,011
No, no. No, don't.

1364
00:58:57,142 --> 00:58:59,318
She... My fucking bitch
ex-wife just did this.

1365
00:58:59,448 --> 00:59:00,841
She put me on a fucking list.

1366
00:59:00,972 --> 00:59:02,974
She put me on a fucking
restraining order!

1367
00:59:03,104 --> 00:59:04,342
I'm not gonna be able
to see my daughter. I'm...

1368
00:59:04,366 --> 00:59:07,326
It's okay. Calm down.

1369
00:59:07,456 --> 00:59:09,284
I know another way, okay.

1370
00:59:13,375 --> 00:59:14,695
You look like shit,
you know that?

1371
00:59:17,466 --> 00:59:18,555
I got fired.

1372
00:59:22,080 --> 00:59:23,560
Okay? I got fired.

1373
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:30,871
I lost my fucking insurance.

1374
00:59:31,002 --> 00:59:32,351
I'm gonna lose my apartment.

1375
00:59:39,706 --> 00:59:41,510
You know, you're raising
a kid and you got a reason

1376
00:59:41,534 --> 00:59:42,990
to get up in the morning,
that's what you do.

1377
00:59:43,014 --> 00:59:45,079
You get up in the morning.
That's, that's what you do.

1378
00:59:45,103 --> 00:59:46,583
You know? That's what you do.

1379
00:59:48,541 --> 00:59:51,239
You got a kid, right,
so you get up for the kid.

1380
00:59:56,941 --> 00:59:58,682
Then you don't have
a reason to get up.

1381
01:00:03,208 --> 01:00:04,252
And that...

1382
01:00:16,351 --> 01:00:17,614
I'm gonna go back in there.

1383
01:00:17,744 --> 01:00:18,895
- No, no, no.
- I'm gonna go back in there.

1384
01:00:18,919 --> 01:00:20,921
You made her a nervous wreck,
you know that.

1385
01:00:22,444 --> 01:00:25,099
I know Miss Dhawan had
some issues. I am aware.

1386
01:00:25,230 --> 01:00:28,015
You were one of the
biggest issues she had, Jess.

1387
01:00:28,146 --> 01:00:29,346
Because she didn't come to me.

1388
01:00:31,584 --> 01:00:35,414
I think you've cultivated
a, a culture of fear,

1389
01:00:35,544 --> 01:00:37,044
- a toxic culture here.
- Are you making

1390
01:00:37,068 --> 01:00:38,436
a direct connection
between the accident

1391
01:00:38,460 --> 01:00:39,984
and the evaluations?

1392
01:00:40,114 --> 01:00:41,570
And what if I am?
Are you just gonna deflect it?

1393
01:00:41,594 --> 01:00:43,596
Or are you gonna
actually refute it in some way?

1394
01:00:43,727 --> 01:00:45,293
You know you made her
a nervous wreck.

1395
01:00:45,424 --> 01:00:47,644
Refute? I'm not gonna refute
your spurious accusations.

1396
01:00:47,774 --> 01:00:50,298
Guys, are we not
all being evaluated

1397
01:00:50,429 --> 01:00:52,300
anonymously by students?

1398
01:00:53,998 --> 01:00:57,218
Is that maybe a little unethical
if he never asked us about it?

1399
01:00:57,349 --> 01:00:58,761
You've brought it
to the teacher's union,

1400
01:00:58,785 --> 01:01:00,763
why don't you leave it at that
instead of bringing it

1401
01:01:00,787 --> 01:01:02,920
into this room and making it
everyone's business.

1402
01:01:03,050 --> 01:01:05,096
It is everyone's business!

1403
01:01:05,226 --> 01:01:06,987
It is everyone's business
if we're being snitched on

1404
01:01:07,011 --> 01:01:09,143
by students at your behest.

1405
01:01:09,274 --> 01:01:12,320
I would sincerely
appreciate your support.

1406
01:01:12,451 --> 01:01:15,497
There are a thousand kids
in this school.

1407
01:01:15,628 --> 01:01:17,171
Of course,
you don't get what I'm saying.

1408
01:01:17,195 --> 01:01:19,153
Most of them are still here.

1409
01:01:19,284 --> 01:01:21,678
And we have to continue
to educate them.

1410
01:01:21,808 --> 01:01:23,699
- You think about education.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1411
01:01:23,723 --> 01:01:25,551
Education is what
they're here for?

1412
01:01:25,682 --> 01:01:27,596
Is it what you're here for?
Give me a break.

1413
01:01:27,727 --> 01:01:29,424
Empower us,
'cause we're the ones

1414
01:01:29,555 --> 01:01:30,575
who care about the education.

1415
01:01:30,599 --> 01:01:32,514
Not the parents,
not the students.

1416
01:01:32,645 --> 01:01:35,126
You just want to get
better grades and get them

1417
01:01:35,256 --> 01:01:37,096
into better colleges,
so when we give them a B,

1418
01:01:37,215 --> 01:01:38,607
they come after us.

1419
01:01:38,738 --> 01:01:40,261
If you don't
feel like you wanna come

1420
01:01:40,392 --> 01:01:42,307
to this meeting, I understand,

1421
01:01:42,437 --> 01:01:44,004
and you are excused.

1422
01:01:44,135 --> 01:01:45,575
All you're doing
is deflecting, Jess.

1423
01:01:45,702 --> 01:01:47,181
Would you keep your voice down?

1424
01:01:47,312 --> 01:01:48,313
You, shut up!

1425
01:01:48,443 --> 01:01:49,706
Whoa, Jason, let's...

1426
01:01:49,836 --> 01:01:51,335
I think you're here
to make a name for yourself.

1427
01:01:51,359 --> 01:01:52,989
- You wanna clean up the school.
- I think you need to leave.

1428
01:01:53,013 --> 01:01:54,232
I need to leave?

1429
01:01:54,362 --> 01:01:55,762
I think you need
to leave right now.

1430
01:01:57,539 --> 01:01:58,366
It's not us against them.

1431
01:01:58,497 --> 01:01:59,541
We're all trying

1432
01:01:59,672 --> 01:02:01,805
to work it out, together, okay?

1433
01:02:03,807 --> 01:02:05,306
Get that in your brain.
Instead of this.

1434
01:02:05,330 --> 01:02:07,201
Give me a break, Jamie.

1435
01:02:07,332 --> 01:02:08,420
Give me a break.

1436
01:02:08,550 --> 01:02:09,987
There's no need to insult...

1437
01:02:11,684 --> 01:02:12,792
- I think it's pretty insulting.
- fellow staff members.

1438
01:02:12,816 --> 01:02:14,165
I think it's pretty insulting

1439
01:02:14,295 --> 01:02:15,664
that she's coming in here
lecturing me

1440
01:02:15,688 --> 01:02:16,907
and treating me like an idiot

1441
01:02:17,037 --> 01:02:18,517
when I've been a teacher

1442
01:02:18,647 --> 01:02:20,147
- for seven years, and she has...
- She's trying to give you

1443
01:02:20,171 --> 01:02:21,650
a different perspective.

1444
01:02:21,781 --> 01:02:23,411
The problem is, you and him
have made the kids feel like

1445
01:02:23,435 --> 01:02:24,629
they're the adults in the room,

1446
01:02:24,653 --> 01:02:26,022
like they should have
the authority.

1447
01:02:26,046 --> 01:02:27,569
Why are you so angry?

1448
01:02:27,700 --> 01:02:28,483
Because you're an idiot...

1449
01:02:28,614 --> 01:02:30,050
and you're questioning me

1450
01:02:30,181 --> 01:02:32,028
- like I'm an idiot.
- Whoa, whoa, Jason, just...

1451
01:02:32,052 --> 01:02:33,271
I'm the school counselor,

1452
01:02:33,401 --> 01:02:34,770
- I'm a psychologist.
- Yeah, I know you want this

1453
01:02:34,794 --> 01:02:36,293
- petri dish to be...
- So I get a lot more shit

1454
01:02:36,317 --> 01:02:37,425
- than you do.
- your own psych ward.

1455
01:02:37,449 --> 01:02:38,755
I get that.

1456
01:02:38,885 --> 01:02:40,844
You know, there are
other places to teach.

1457
01:02:40,974 --> 01:02:41,845
What?

1458
01:02:41,975 --> 01:02:43,368
There are other places to teach.

1459
01:02:43,498 --> 01:02:44,804
Are you kidding?

1460
01:02:46,719 --> 01:02:50,418
You want solidarity?
Stop coming after teachers.

1461
01:02:50,549 --> 01:02:52,464
When was the last time
you were in a classroom?

1462
01:02:52,594 --> 01:02:54,834
When was the last time you
sat in on anybody's classroom?

1463
01:03:00,080 --> 01:03:01,080
That's what I thought.

1464
01:03:12,658 --> 01:03:13,658
What are you doin'?

1465
01:03:15,487 --> 01:03:17,087
- What are you doin'?
- I'm thanking him.

1466
01:03:18,142 --> 01:03:19,404
God?

1467
01:03:19,534 --> 01:03:21,275
Yeah, God, for leaving
the door open for us.

1468
01:03:25,018 --> 01:03:28,065
Oh, shit. Shit.

1469
01:03:28,195 --> 01:03:29,607
You, uh, you gonna take
your thanks back?

1470
01:03:29,631 --> 01:03:31,372
No.

1471
01:03:31,503 --> 01:03:32,547
What the fuck is that?

1472
01:03:33,461 --> 01:03:34,941
What're you doin'?

1473
01:03:35,072 --> 01:03:36,072
I'm praying.

1474
01:03:37,639 --> 01:03:38,902
To the lock?

1475
01:03:40,425 --> 01:03:41,121
What language is that?

1476
01:03:41,252 --> 01:03:43,036
Arabic.

1477
01:03:43,167 --> 01:03:44,516
- Arabic?
- Shh.

1478
01:03:44,646 --> 01:03:46,387
Isn't that a
different religion than before?

1479
01:03:46,518 --> 01:03:48,128
Does the religion matter?

1480
01:03:48,259 --> 01:03:50,609
Do you have just, like,
a different religion

1481
01:03:50,739 --> 01:03:52,829
- for every situation or...
- No.

1482
01:03:55,179 --> 01:03:57,311
Let's smoke. Let's smoke.

1483
01:03:57,442 --> 01:03:58,660
There is no smoking inside.

1484
01:03:58,791 --> 01:03:59,836
Fucking America.

1485
01:04:04,101 --> 01:04:05,406
Come on.

1486
01:04:05,537 --> 01:04:07,191
Why do you have a gun?

1487
01:04:07,321 --> 01:04:08,757
I wanna know why you have a gun.

1488
01:04:08,888 --> 01:04:10,498
- Why?
- Because, what are you,

1489
01:04:10,629 --> 01:04:11,867
- a criminal or something?
- Why do you want to know?

1490
01:04:11,891 --> 01:04:13,129
Are you a criminal or something?

1491
01:04:13,153 --> 01:04:14,807
Do I look like a criminal?

1492
01:04:14,938 --> 01:04:17,070
Yes, yes, you look
like a fuckin' criminal.

1493
01:04:17,201 --> 01:04:18,881
And I'm not lettin' you
in here with a gun!

1494
01:04:18,985 --> 01:04:21,814
We're in America, Davy.
We're in America.

1495
01:04:21,945 --> 01:04:23,381
It's the easiest thing
in the world,

1496
01:04:23,511 --> 01:04:24,773
having a gun in America.

1497
01:04:24,904 --> 01:04:26,471
Bullshit, why do you have a gun?

1498
01:04:26,601 --> 01:04:28,473
I owe money to the wrong people,

1499
01:04:28,603 --> 01:04:29,603
that's why.

1500
01:04:35,741 --> 01:04:39,310
Aye, uh, I gotta be
out of my fucking mind.

1501
01:04:39,440 --> 01:04:41,747
Uh, yeah, um,
I'm just calling to confirm

1502
01:04:41,878 --> 01:04:44,141
my appointment for this evening.

1503
01:04:44,271 --> 01:04:46,883
Uh, yeah.
Willmore, Alis. Mm-hmm.

1504
01:04:48,319 --> 01:04:49,319
Thank you.

1505
01:04:58,242 --> 01:04:59,402
You must think I'm an asshole.

1506
01:05:01,767 --> 01:05:03,247
No.

1507
01:05:04,596 --> 01:05:06,554
It's too scary to stand up

1508
01:05:06,685 --> 01:05:08,426
the way you did, you know.

1509
01:05:08,556 --> 01:05:09,556
Not everyone...

1510
01:05:12,473 --> 01:05:13,692
can do that.

1511
01:05:20,003 --> 01:05:21,482
Can I buy you a cup of coffee?

1512
01:05:23,223 --> 01:05:25,660
Just to prove I'm not a monster.

1513
01:05:27,401 --> 01:05:29,577
Um...

1514
01:05:30,839 --> 01:05:31,928
I'm not married.

1515
01:05:33,973 --> 01:05:36,454
I'm, I'm sorry.
That was so stupid.

1516
01:05:36,584 --> 01:05:38,064
I'm sorry, uh, I am...

1517
01:05:38,195 --> 01:05:39,195
Coffee sounds good.

1518
01:05:41,241 --> 01:05:42,241
Yeah?

1519
01:05:44,549 --> 01:05:48,161
Will you just please just
stop talking bullshit to me.

1520
01:05:48,292 --> 01:05:49,989
You don't believe
in any of that.

1521
01:05:51,338 --> 01:05:54,515
No, I believe
in facts and logic.

1522
01:05:54,646 --> 01:05:58,476
Logic. How about numbers?

1523
01:05:58,606 --> 01:06:00,130
Yeah, numbers, numbers are good.

1524
01:06:01,522 --> 01:06:03,785
Numbers are good.
How about 9-11?

1525
01:06:03,916 --> 01:06:05,700
- 9-11?
- Yeah.

1526
01:06:05,831 --> 01:06:08,399
The day the American dream died.

1527
01:06:08,529 --> 01:06:10,401
Where I come from,

1528
01:06:10,531 --> 01:06:13,056
9-11 means
the ninth of November.

1529
01:06:14,448 --> 01:06:15,648
Only Americans read backwards.

1530
01:06:16,711 --> 01:06:20,498
9-11, 1989.

1531
01:06:22,326 --> 01:06:24,197
It was the middle of the night

1532
01:06:24,328 --> 01:06:25,590
when the wall came down.

1533
01:06:25,720 --> 01:06:26,591
You know that, huh?

1534
01:06:26,721 --> 01:06:28,549
No, I was 11.
I don't know that.

1535
01:06:28,680 --> 01:06:31,509
You were 11. You were 11.
Do you see that?

1536
01:06:31,639 --> 01:06:33,598
9-11, you were 11.

1537
01:06:33,728 --> 01:06:35,687
Okay, okay, okay.

1538
01:06:35,817 --> 01:06:37,558
Big party day.
November 9th,

1539
01:06:37,689 --> 01:06:38,951
I was in Berlin.

1540
01:06:39,082 --> 01:06:42,781
Everyone is out
on the road, celebrating

1541
01:06:42,911 --> 01:06:45,001
that they got
capitalism, freedom.

1542
01:06:45,131 --> 01:06:48,221
And people still thought
that freedom is to buy stuff.

1543
01:06:48,352 --> 01:06:50,397
Bananas everywhere,
they didn't have bananas.

1544
01:06:50,528 --> 01:06:52,399
Behind the wall,
there were no bananas,

1545
01:06:52,530 --> 01:06:54,401
so when they came to freedom,

1546
01:06:54,532 --> 01:06:56,186
they were rewarded with...

1547
01:06:57,448 --> 01:06:58,710
bananas.

1548
01:07:00,364 --> 01:07:05,673
You know what November 9th was
up until the big party day?

1549
01:07:07,414 --> 01:07:11,157
It was called The Night
of Broken Glass,

1550
01:07:11,288 --> 01:07:13,638
November 9, 1938.

1551
01:07:13,768 --> 01:07:17,859
That was the same day
as, be careful,

1552
01:07:17,990 --> 01:07:19,644
when the wall came down.

1553
01:07:19,774 --> 01:07:21,515
My point is,

1554
01:07:21,646 --> 01:07:25,476
a bad day became
a good day, just like that.

1555
01:07:26,825 --> 01:07:28,218
You don't believe
in any of that?

1556
01:07:28,348 --> 01:07:31,438
No, I believe
in facts and logic.

1557
01:07:31,569 --> 01:07:33,701
Facts... Are you okay?

1558
01:07:33,832 --> 01:07:35,181
- Yeah.
- This is a fact.

1559
01:07:35,312 --> 01:07:36,312
This is logic.

1560
01:12:02,230 --> 01:12:03,319
Okay.

1561
01:12:26,254 --> 01:12:27,343
Wow.

1562
01:12:29,780 --> 01:12:31,700
Parents are a thing
of the past, don't you think?

1563
01:12:35,133 --> 01:12:36,133
Wow.

1564
01:12:38,223 --> 01:12:39,355
There's so many people here.

1565
01:12:41,182 --> 01:12:42,880
And they're all so pissed.

1566
01:12:43,010 --> 01:12:45,839
Good afternoon, ladies
and gentlemen. Good afternoon.

1567
01:12:45,970 --> 01:12:46,797
- I guess I'd be angry too.
- Can everyone please

1568
01:12:46,927 --> 01:12:48,320
take a seat.

1569
01:12:48,451 --> 01:12:50,191
You know, it could be
any one of their kids.

1570
01:12:50,322 --> 01:12:51,845
Thank you, thank you.

1571
01:12:51,976 --> 01:12:53,388
That's just another reason
not to have them.

1572
01:12:53,412 --> 01:12:55,327
Look, the sooner we get started,

1573
01:12:55,458 --> 01:12:58,199
the more information
you get from us, thank you.

1574
01:12:58,330 --> 01:13:00,854
All right, I'm,
I'm Principal Williamson.

1575
01:13:00,985 --> 01:13:03,814
We appreciate you being here
more than you know.

1576
01:13:03,944 --> 01:13:07,078
Uh, I sincerely apologize
for the way you were notified.

1577
01:13:07,208 --> 01:13:08,993
We're gonna get started
today with a report

1578
01:13:09,123 --> 01:13:11,691
from our school safety officer,
Officer Genet.

1579
01:13:13,127 --> 01:13:15,565
Hello, everyone, thank you
for your attention.

1580
01:13:15,695 --> 01:13:18,219
I am Officer Genet of the NYPD

1581
01:13:18,350 --> 01:13:21,353
and head of security
here at Coles.

1582
01:13:21,484 --> 01:13:22,789
- Alis.
- We understand

1583
01:13:22,920 --> 01:13:24,288
that this is
a very difficult time...

1584
01:13:24,312 --> 01:13:26,576
Sittin' here
by your lonesome, huh?

1585
01:13:26,706 --> 01:13:28,012
- Oh...
- Did I miss everything?

1586
01:13:28,142 --> 01:13:29,187
Has issued notices

1587
01:13:29,317 --> 01:13:32,277
of violations
to the institution.

1588
01:13:32,408 --> 01:13:34,366
An NOV will list violations

1589
01:13:34,497 --> 01:13:37,064
and must be corrected
within 35 days.

1590
01:13:37,195 --> 01:13:39,806
- Oh, come on.
- It is the responsibility

1591
01:13:39,937 --> 01:13:43,723
of the NYPD, the FDNY, Coles...

1592
01:13:43,854 --> 01:13:44,855
Oh, hey, Jack.

1593
01:13:44,985 --> 01:13:46,345
- How are you, buddy.
- It's Jason.

1594
01:13:46,465 --> 01:13:50,295
Parents to make
a serious commitment

1595
01:13:50,426 --> 01:13:53,124
towards all of this compliance.

1596
01:13:53,254 --> 01:13:54,952
- At this time,
- That's my seat.

1597
01:13:55,082 --> 01:13:56,973
That's all I have for you,
I will now turn the meeting

1598
01:13:56,997 --> 01:13:58,869
- back over to...
- And that's my coffee too.

1599
01:13:58,999 --> 01:14:00,159
Oh, that's your coffee, okay.

1600
01:14:00,261 --> 01:14:02,002
- Yeah.
- Okay, great.

1601
01:14:02,133 --> 01:14:03,264
- Talk to you later.
- Okay.

1602
01:14:03,395 --> 01:14:05,528
Thank you, Officer Genet.

1603
01:14:05,658 --> 01:14:09,793
We will be working very closely
with her in the coming weeks

1604
01:14:09,923 --> 01:14:11,925
regarding all of the
violations that she mentioned.

1605
01:14:15,842 --> 01:14:18,062
- Hi.
- Hey, um...

1606
01:14:18,192 --> 01:14:18,976
How's it goin' up there?

1607
01:14:19,106 --> 01:14:21,631
Um, it's, it's loud.

1608
01:14:21,761 --> 01:14:24,416
Um, have, have you...

1609
01:14:24,547 --> 01:14:25,907
have you seen
the principal's wife?

1610
01:14:26,940 --> 01:14:28,681
Yeah, she came in earlier today.

1611
01:14:28,812 --> 01:14:30,422
No, I mean, like
a couple minutes ago.

1612
01:14:30,553 --> 01:14:32,033
Have you seen her?
Did she go by here?

1613
01:14:32,163 --> 01:14:34,948
Uh, I don't, I don't think so.

1614
01:14:35,079 --> 01:14:37,473
I mean, I had
to go the bathroom, I mean.

1615
01:14:39,213 --> 01:14:40,650
I'm sorry.

1616
01:14:40,780 --> 01:14:42,086
I fell asleep.

1617
01:14:45,089 --> 01:14:48,222
You know, I have that condition,
um, insomnia condition,

1618
01:14:48,353 --> 01:14:49,353
since Afghanistan.

1619
01:14:50,964 --> 01:14:51,964
All right, um...

1620
01:14:54,185 --> 01:14:56,056
Can I, can I come in there?

1621
01:14:56,187 --> 01:14:57,754
Just for a second.

1622
01:14:57,884 --> 01:14:58,884
Yeah.

1623
01:15:00,583 --> 01:15:01,951
I was supposed
to keep an eye on her

1624
01:15:01,975 --> 01:15:04,084
and stay with her and make sure
she didn't leave my sight,

1625
01:15:04,108 --> 01:15:06,458
and I messed that up
and now she's gone.

1626
01:15:06,589 --> 01:15:08,669
I have no idea what I'm
gonna say, like I don't know.

1627
01:15:08,721 --> 01:15:10,070
She's an adult.

1628
01:15:10,201 --> 01:15:12,856
But that... Okay, the meeting
that's going on upstairs

1629
01:15:12,986 --> 01:15:14,964
is because I sent out an email,
I was supposed to send it

1630
01:15:14,988 --> 01:15:16,990
to, like, a few people,
and I sent it to everybody.

1631
01:15:17,121 --> 01:15:19,273
Because I just can't, apparently
just can't do anything.

1632
01:15:19,297 --> 01:15:20,733
- Okay, okay.
- Right?

1633
01:15:20,864 --> 01:15:22,082
Hey.

1634
01:15:22,213 --> 01:15:23,693
I'm living upstairs right now.

1635
01:15:23,823 --> 01:15:25,129
I'm sleeping upstairs,

1636
01:15:25,259 --> 01:15:26,541
and I, I can't,
I can't keep an eye

1637
01:15:26,565 --> 01:15:28,306
on the principal's wife
for five minutes.

1638
01:15:28,436 --> 01:15:29,756
I'm not paying my rent.
I'm not...

1639
01:15:31,178 --> 01:15:33,485
I have a question. Why are
our kids being investigated

1640
01:15:33,616 --> 01:15:35,443
without us or our lawyers
being present?

1641
01:15:35,574 --> 01:15:40,057
So a parent says,
wady-bomby-domby-domby-dah.

1642
01:15:40,187 --> 01:15:41,232
And you're gonna say.

1643
01:15:41,362 --> 01:15:43,887
Until we let this process
take its course,

1644
01:15:44,017 --> 01:15:45,429
there's really nothing more
I can share with you.

1645
01:15:45,453 --> 01:15:46,561
I don't understand.
What does that mean?

1646
01:15:46,585 --> 01:15:48,500
They're only gonna
respect you more

1647
01:15:48,631 --> 01:15:50,894
as a result of this,
I guarantee you.

1648
01:15:51,024 --> 01:15:53,331
- Teacher was wearing goggles...
- There's a process...

1649
01:15:53,461 --> 01:15:54,741
but none
of the students were?

1650
01:15:56,247 --> 01:15:57,248
Is it true?

1651
01:15:59,032 --> 01:16:00,556
Yes, that is true.

1652
01:16:00,686 --> 01:16:02,098
- How is that possible?
- Oh, my God.

1653
01:16:02,122 --> 01:16:03,362
Are there no safety regulations?

1654
01:16:03,428 --> 01:16:04,821
Yes, there are
safety regulations.

1655
01:16:04,951 --> 01:16:06,387
The science teacher
made a choice,

1656
01:16:06,518 --> 01:16:08,999
an unfortunate choice
in this instance.

1657
01:16:09,129 --> 01:16:10,672
- That's ridiculous.
- But really she's not obliged

1658
01:16:10,696 --> 01:16:12,152
- to, to, make students...
- No, that's crazy.

1659
01:16:12,176 --> 01:16:14,918
And what about the
the chemicals themselves

1660
01:16:15,048 --> 01:16:15,919
- I heard that it was broken.
- Obviously, something got

1661
01:16:16,049 --> 01:16:17,529
a little out
of control in this case.

1662
01:16:17,660 --> 01:16:19,226
Frankly, it's also
a matter of budget.

1663
01:16:19,357 --> 01:16:20,488
You should've told me.

1664
01:16:20,619 --> 01:16:22,229
I would've got you
safety goggles.

1665
01:16:22,360 --> 01:16:24,275
There's a child
in the hospital right now,

1666
01:16:24,405 --> 01:16:25,600
and you're talking about budget?

1667
01:16:25,624 --> 01:16:26,862
So the kids get to not wear
safety goggles.

1668
01:16:26,886 --> 01:16:28,105
You got some stones, man.

1669
01:16:28,235 --> 01:16:30,075
Can we have less questions
in the room, please.

1670
01:16:31,195 --> 01:16:33,284
- You're not the only one here.
- That is not...

1671
01:16:33,414 --> 01:16:35,254
Oh, so you get
to decide how this meeting goes?

1672
01:16:35,286 --> 01:16:36,393
That's really self-centered.

1673
01:16:36,417 --> 01:16:38,115
I'm self-centered?

1674
01:16:38,245 --> 01:16:39,116
- We almost had a heart attack.
- I'm self-centered?

1675
01:16:39,246 --> 01:16:40,246
Are you fucking serious?

1676
01:16:45,165 --> 01:16:47,690
He was crying.
He was, he was hurting.

1677
01:16:49,039 --> 01:16:50,954
And I was just doing
everything I could

1678
01:16:51,084 --> 01:16:52,259
to help him, you know.

1679
01:16:52,390 --> 01:16:54,261
Yeah, we know you did
everything you could.

1680
01:16:59,005 --> 01:17:00,005
I really tried.

1681
01:17:01,486 --> 01:17:02,966
I used everything that I knew.

1682
01:17:04,707 --> 01:17:06,796
I know.
Did he say anything?

1683
01:17:08,580 --> 01:17:14,020
Um... yeah. Well, he was
saying a lot of things

1684
01:17:14,151 --> 01:17:16,196
and um, a couple things.

1685
01:17:16,327 --> 01:17:17,371
But there's one thing

1686
01:17:17,502 --> 01:17:18,740
in particular
that he was saying,

1687
01:17:18,764 --> 01:17:21,419
but I don't,
I don't know if it would...

1688
01:17:21,549 --> 01:17:23,334
make sense to you,
like it's, you know,

1689
01:17:23,464 --> 01:17:24,944
people say things when they're

1690
01:17:25,075 --> 01:17:26,755
- in shock so...
- Mm-hmm, what did he say?

1691
01:17:27,947 --> 01:17:28,947
Um...

1692
01:17:31,429 --> 01:17:33,474
he said I would
rather pick up dog shit

1693
01:17:33,605 --> 01:17:34,650
than stay with him.

1694
01:17:36,260 --> 01:17:39,655
I had heard J.C. and him
fighting earlier that day,

1695
01:17:41,526 --> 01:17:43,006
and he was screaming at him,

1696
01:17:43,136 --> 01:17:45,443
I'd rather pick up dog shit
than stay with him.

1697
01:17:45,573 --> 01:17:47,413
I'd rather pick up dog shit
than stay with him.

1698
01:17:49,055 --> 01:17:50,535
- Did you...
- It sounds weird, right?

1699
01:17:52,450 --> 01:17:53,450
It doesn't make sense.

1700
01:17:54,539 --> 01:17:55,995
The only other thing
that he was saying,

1701
01:17:56,019 --> 01:17:57,431
and I don't know
if it was in reference

1702
01:17:57,455 --> 01:18:00,501
to this or not,
but he was saying it was a joke.

1703
01:18:00,632 --> 01:18:02,634
- A joke?
- It was a joke, it was a joke.

1704
01:18:02,765 --> 01:18:04,549
He was like, ah, joke,
it was a joke.

1705
01:18:04,680 --> 01:18:07,030
And like, he was...

1706
01:18:07,160 --> 01:18:08,466
Any idea?

1707
01:18:10,250 --> 01:18:13,253
No. I didn't know.
I mean, it was just

1708
01:18:13,384 --> 01:18:15,908
a sight to see him,
you know, he's,

1709
01:18:16,039 --> 01:18:17,997
you know he is
a good kid, right?

1710
01:18:18,128 --> 01:18:21,087
He's such a good kid.
I liked him a lot.

1711
01:18:21,218 --> 01:18:23,378
He was always really nice
to me and really sweet to me.

1712
01:18:23,481 --> 01:18:26,266
Okay, just, um...

1713
01:18:26,397 --> 01:18:28,007
Thank you.

1714
01:18:28,138 --> 01:18:29,938
You know, he's lucky
you responded so quickly.

1715
01:18:31,402 --> 01:18:32,402
Do you really think so?

1716
01:18:34,231 --> 01:18:35,231
I know so.

1717
01:18:36,624 --> 01:18:38,365
I tried so hard.

1718
01:18:38,496 --> 01:18:39,496
I know.

1719
01:18:40,803 --> 01:18:42,630
It's okay, okay.
Let's... We're done.

1720
01:18:42,761 --> 01:18:44,043
- Okay.
- This is great. Thank you.

1721
01:18:44,067 --> 01:18:45,503
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1722
01:18:45,633 --> 01:18:47,070
You were really helpful.
Thank you.

1723
01:18:47,200 --> 01:18:48,308
- It was a pleasure...
- Thank you for coming down.

1724
01:18:48,332 --> 01:18:49,332
To meet you.

1725
01:18:55,643 --> 01:18:57,080
Yeah, excuse me.

1726
01:19:25,238 --> 01:19:26,259
Can you get yourself together

1727
01:19:26,283 --> 01:19:27,153
and...

1728
01:19:27,284 --> 01:19:28,684
Do you want some water
or something?

1729
01:19:31,636 --> 01:19:32,700
All right, I'll take
you to see your counselor,

1730
01:19:32,724 --> 01:19:33,884
and it'll be okay, all right?

1731
01:19:35,422 --> 01:19:36,510
- Natalie...
- Hi, I've got

1732
01:19:36,641 --> 01:19:38,077
to get her to her counselor.

1733
01:19:38,208 --> 01:19:39,848
- All right.
- Come on, sweetie. Let's go.

1734
01:19:42,125 --> 01:19:43,445
- J.C.
- I gotta use the bathroom.

1735
01:19:48,653 --> 01:19:49,893
- The principal's office?
- Yes.

1736
01:19:51,743 --> 01:19:55,486
Um, it was there
two days ago, but...

1737
01:19:57,270 --> 01:19:59,161
- they moved it down the hall.
- What happened to your eye?

1738
01:19:59,185 --> 01:20:00,185
What?

1739
01:20:00,273 --> 01:20:02,101
What happened? You all right?

1740
01:20:02,232 --> 01:20:03,252
Yeah, I'm good, I'm good.
Don't worry about it.

1741
01:20:03,276 --> 01:20:05,104
Uh, two things, actually.

1742
01:20:05,235 --> 01:20:08,934
Uh, one, that there were
trace amounts of methanol

1743
01:20:09,065 --> 01:20:10,065
on all the beakers.

1744
01:20:11,154 --> 01:20:13,243
But also that
they were varying degrees.

1745
01:20:13,373 --> 01:20:16,028
What the hell? She said
she didn't use methanol.

1746
01:20:16,159 --> 01:20:17,639
- But there was methanol?
- There was.

1747
01:20:20,641 --> 01:20:22,252
There was an accident
up there yesterday.

1748
01:20:23,775 --> 01:20:25,342
Kid got burned really bad.

1749
01:20:27,474 --> 01:20:28,562
He died?

1750
01:20:28,693 --> 01:20:30,826
He's in a coma.

1751
01:20:30,956 --> 01:20:32,697
- Poor teacher.
- Poor teacher?

1752
01:20:32,828 --> 01:20:34,830
Yeah,
she fucked up. Poor teacher.

1753
01:20:34,960 --> 01:20:36,416
What do you mean
he wasn't supposed to be there?

1754
01:20:36,440 --> 01:20:37,634
He wasn't supposed
to be up there.

1755
01:20:37,658 --> 01:20:38,964
He was called up by her.

1756
01:20:40,444 --> 01:20:42,576
What was
the disruption in class that

1757
01:20:42,707 --> 01:20:44,067
she had to call
Matty up front for?

1758
01:20:44,622 --> 01:20:46,276
Were you guys just...

1759
01:20:46,406 --> 01:20:48,800
I actually, I'm not too sure,
we were just talking.

1760
01:20:48,931 --> 01:20:51,194
I mean, not even loud at all.
We were kinda whispering.

1761
01:20:51,324 --> 01:20:53,204
And what did you do
when the explosion happened?

1762
01:20:54,284 --> 01:20:55,564
Well, the rest
of the class just,

1763
01:20:55,633 --> 01:20:57,567
we all just ran to the back
and opened the windows

1764
01:20:57,591 --> 01:20:58,591
to breathe.

1765
01:20:59,942 --> 01:21:01,006
Were you worried
for your friend?

1766
01:21:01,030 --> 01:21:01,813
Of course I was worried
for my friend.

1767
01:21:01,944 --> 01:21:03,467
Is he a good friend of yours?

1768
01:21:03,597 --> 01:21:07,079
I'd say we're like
best friends, yeah.

1769
01:21:07,210 --> 01:21:09,255
You, Matty, and Lawrence, right,

1770
01:21:09,386 --> 01:21:11,257
- you guys?
- Yeah, yeah.

1771
01:21:11,388 --> 01:21:12,693
The three of you are tight?

1772
01:21:12,824 --> 01:21:14,565
- Yeah, we're like...
- yeah.

1773
01:21:14,695 --> 01:21:16,654
Have you
visited Matty in the hospital?

1774
01:21:18,177 --> 01:21:23,182
No, I was going
to go today, yeah.

1775
01:21:23,313 --> 01:21:24,833
How'd you become
friends with Lawrence?

1776
01:21:27,839 --> 01:21:29,686
Have you been friends
since you were little or...

1777
01:21:29,710 --> 01:21:32,496
No, we did... That was...
No, we recently became friends.

1778
01:21:32,626 --> 01:21:33,889
Yeah?
What prompted that?

1779
01:21:34,019 --> 01:21:36,543
I think it was this one time
when he gave me his homework.

1780
01:21:36,674 --> 01:21:37,805
Aha!

1781
01:21:37,936 --> 01:21:39,329
- There it is.
- Yeah, yeah.

1782
01:21:39,459 --> 01:21:40,808
Yeah.

1783
01:21:40,939 --> 01:21:42,898
Whenever I need help,
he just, he's always there.

1784
01:21:43,811 --> 01:21:45,552
And you...

1785
01:21:47,467 --> 01:21:48,512
No, I just...

1786
01:21:48,642 --> 01:21:49,642
offer your friendship?

1787
01:21:51,341 --> 01:21:54,344
Yeah like, whatever
he needs, I'll be there.

1788
01:21:54,474 --> 01:21:55,345
- Protection.
- You got his back.

1789
01:21:55,475 --> 01:21:56,844
- Yeah, I got his back.
- Protection?

1790
01:21:56,868 --> 01:21:58,130
Does he need protection a lot?

1791
01:21:59,827 --> 01:22:01,351
I mean, you know,
like a kid like that

1792
01:22:01,481 --> 01:22:04,876
in a school like this,
kinda, you know.

1793
01:22:05,007 --> 01:22:07,487
People make,
people poke fun, so...

1794
01:22:07,618 --> 01:22:09,663
What's going on with your face?

1795
01:22:09,794 --> 01:22:11,274
What are you talking about?

1796
01:22:11,404 --> 01:22:12,991
I'm talking about the
mark I can see on your face,

1797
01:22:13,015 --> 01:22:14,712
high on your cheek,
what happened?

1798
01:22:14,842 --> 01:22:17,149
You know, I mean,
you can take the sunglasses off.

1799
01:22:17,280 --> 01:22:18,680
Oh, these are
actually prescription.

1800
01:22:18,803 --> 01:22:21,327
I'm like short-sighted,
I kinda need them to see, so...

1801
01:22:21,458 --> 01:22:24,374
Your, your teachers
let you wear them in class?

1802
01:22:24,504 --> 01:22:27,072
Hm? Yeah, 'cause they know
I can't afford new ones.

1803
01:22:29,118 --> 01:22:31,511
Did some kid rough you up
a little after school?

1804
01:22:31,642 --> 01:22:32,512
Did you steal
somebody's lunch money?

1805
01:22:32,643 --> 01:22:34,297
No, I don't think a kid

1806
01:22:34,427 --> 01:22:35,709
- would rough me up.
- What happened to your face?

1807
01:22:35,733 --> 01:22:37,276
No, you don't look like
you get roughed up

1808
01:22:37,300 --> 01:22:38,344
- by other kids much.
- No.

1809
01:22:38,475 --> 01:22:39,475
Are you the rougher-upper?

1810
01:22:40,520 --> 01:22:42,566
Yeah, I'd say so.

1811
01:22:42,696 --> 01:22:44,611
It was a fight. It was just
a fight, and yeah.

1812
01:22:44,742 --> 01:22:46,831
Yeah? Who was
in the fight with you?

1813
01:22:46,962 --> 01:22:48,659
I don't think that's important.

1814
01:22:48,789 --> 01:22:49,989
I don't think that's relevant.

1815
01:22:50,095 --> 01:22:51,792
It's actually
our job to find out.

1816
01:22:51,923 --> 01:22:53,509
So it doesn't matter if you
think it's relevant or not.

1817
01:22:53,533 --> 01:22:54,946
- Who was in the fight with you?
- Yeah but, like, we're talking

1818
01:22:54,970 --> 01:22:56,034
about Matty, so I don't know

1819
01:22:56,058 --> 01:22:57,470
what this has to do
with that at all.

1820
01:22:57,494 --> 01:22:58,234
Were you
in the fight with Matty?

1821
01:22:58,364 --> 01:22:59,713
No.

1822
01:22:59,844 --> 01:23:01,498
The fight happened
on school grounds?

1823
01:23:01,628 --> 01:23:03,108
Um, yeah.

1824
01:23:05,023 --> 01:23:07,025
Do you get
many phone calls home?

1825
01:23:08,679 --> 01:23:09,679
Had a few.

1826
01:23:09,767 --> 01:23:12,204
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah.

1827
01:23:12,335 --> 01:23:15,381
How'd that go over?
What did they say?

1828
01:23:15,512 --> 01:23:18,863
Um, it was like...

1829
01:23:18,994 --> 01:23:20,734
just like don't do it again.

1830
01:23:20,865 --> 01:23:23,302
It happens.
Blah, blah, blah. Yeah.

1831
01:23:23,433 --> 01:23:24,738
It happens?

1832
01:23:24,869 --> 01:23:25,869
Yeah.

1833
01:23:27,132 --> 01:23:29,004
You and your dad have
a close relationship?

1834
01:23:29,961 --> 01:23:31,832
Mm-hmm.

1835
01:23:31,963 --> 01:23:33,138
Closer than say with your mom?

1836
01:23:35,706 --> 01:23:37,012
My mom actually isn't around.

1837
01:23:38,013 --> 01:23:39,492
Oh, I'm sorry.

1838
01:23:39,623 --> 01:23:40,624
Sorry.

1839
01:23:40,754 --> 01:23:41,754
Yeah.

1840
01:23:43,061 --> 01:23:44,581
You said they called
them on the phone.

1841
01:23:45,542 --> 01:23:49,067
Mm, you said parents,
I just went with parents.

1842
01:23:50,677 --> 01:23:52,597
You know your dad is
crossing the line sometimes,

1843
01:23:52,679 --> 01:23:53,679
and it's not okay.

1844
01:23:53,767 --> 01:23:54,875
Yeah, but I can deal with that.

1845
01:23:54,899 --> 01:23:56,901
Yeah, but clearly you can't.

1846
01:23:57,032 --> 01:23:58,511
All right, Matty was right.

1847
01:23:58,642 --> 01:24:00,442
This is not something
you need to put up with.

1848
01:24:03,864 --> 01:24:05,562
All right, J.C.

1849
01:24:05,692 --> 01:24:06,911
I'm done with this.

1850
01:24:07,042 --> 01:24:07,738
You're done with this.

1851
01:24:07,868 --> 01:24:09,479
Yeah, I'm, I'm done with this.

1852
01:24:09,609 --> 01:24:10,760
Right, that's what
I'm saying to you.

1853
01:24:10,784 --> 01:24:12,308
- You're done with this.
- Mm-hmm.

1854
01:24:12,438 --> 01:24:13,613
You may leave.

1855
01:24:13,744 --> 01:24:15,354
Oh, so you're
telling me to leave.

1856
01:24:15,485 --> 01:24:16,268
- Thank you.
- I'm going

1857
01:24:16,399 --> 01:24:17,182
because I wanna go.

1858
01:24:17,313 --> 01:24:19,010
Thank you very much.

1859
01:24:19,141 --> 01:24:21,491
All right,
don't tell me what to do.

1860
01:24:21,621 --> 01:24:23,319
We'll call you in
if we have any questions.

1861
01:24:26,017 --> 01:24:27,081
Someone's gonna shoot us, boy.

1862
01:24:27,105 --> 01:24:28,324
No one's gonna shoot at me.

1863
01:24:28,454 --> 01:24:29,518
Watch your fuckin' shoes, bro!

1864
01:24:29,542 --> 01:24:30,542
- Stop.
- Stop.

1865
01:24:30,587 --> 01:24:31,414
Don't...
What are you doing?

1866
01:24:31,544 --> 01:24:33,111
Shit.

1867
01:24:33,242 --> 01:24:34,962
Open it, open it,
open it, open it, open it.

1868
01:24:36,767 --> 01:24:37,767
- Go.
- Oh, my God.

1869
01:24:39,422 --> 01:24:40,771
Where are the lights?

1870
01:24:49,997 --> 01:24:51,117
Come on, guys, let's get it.

1871
01:24:52,739 --> 01:24:53,740
Come on!

1872
01:24:57,309 --> 01:24:58,309
You'd like that.

1873
01:25:01,705 --> 01:25:02,836
What's this gonna do?

1874
01:25:02,967 --> 01:25:04,647
It's gonna do exactly
what I want it to do.

1875
01:25:09,843 --> 01:25:10,931
What the fuck was that?

1876
01:25:11,062 --> 01:25:12,502
- Let's go.
- What the fuck was that?

1877
01:25:16,502 --> 01:25:17,740
- Just leave, just leave.
- Let's go, let's go.

1878
01:25:17,764 --> 01:25:19,002
- We gotta go, we gotta go.
- Go, go. Just go on.

1879
01:25:19,026 --> 01:25:20,656
- No, no, we all gotta go.
- Just go. Wait by the door.

1880
01:25:20,680 --> 01:25:21,507
You wanna get in trouble?

1881
01:25:21,638 --> 01:25:22,465
We're not getting in trouble.

1882
01:25:22,595 --> 01:25:23,640
We're gonna get in trouble.

1883
01:25:23,770 --> 01:25:25,183
Wait, wait, actually...
He's actually... Wait.

1884
01:25:25,207 --> 01:25:27,034
Of course I'm right.
I'm always fucking right.

1885
01:25:27,165 --> 01:25:28,485
- Matty, w need to go!
- Let's go!

1886
01:25:28,514 --> 01:25:29,954
Let's go. We have
to get out of here!

1887
01:25:39,699 --> 01:25:40,918
Have a seat. Hi.

1888
01:25:41,048 --> 01:25:42,069
Can I talk to you for a second?

1889
01:25:42,093 --> 01:25:42,920
Yeah.

1890
01:25:43,050 --> 01:25:43,877
I know I was running late.

1891
01:25:44,008 --> 01:25:45,009
I'll be there.

1892
01:25:45,140 --> 01:25:46,967
No, I haven't changed my mind.

1893
01:25:47,098 --> 01:25:48,858
Listen, I can't talk
right now. I have to go.

1894
01:25:49,796 --> 01:25:50,796
Okay.

1895
01:25:50,841 --> 01:25:52,103
Really upset.

1896
01:25:52,234 --> 01:25:53,800
They were talking
about the accident

1897
01:25:53,931 --> 01:25:57,891
that happened yesterday,
and she just fell apart.

1898
01:26:20,697 --> 01:26:21,697
Excuse me?

1899
01:26:23,830 --> 01:26:24,830
Who let you in here?

1900
01:26:28,444 --> 01:26:29,488
You can't be in here.

1901
01:26:40,456 --> 01:26:41,456
You can smell it.

1902
01:26:42,632 --> 01:26:43,632
What?

1903
01:26:43,720 --> 01:26:45,504
You can smell
the drugs in the pee.

1904
01:26:45,635 --> 01:26:48,768
That's how I found out
that Adam was using drugs.

1905
01:26:48,899 --> 01:26:50,205
What, he forgot to flush?

1906
01:26:53,686 --> 01:26:57,908
He forgot. He always forgets.

1907
01:26:58,038 --> 01:27:00,911
You know why people
do drugs in the toilets?

1908
01:27:01,041 --> 01:27:02,739
- This is a school!
- Okay!

1909
01:27:02,869 --> 01:27:04,629
Look, will you just put
the gun away, please?

1910
01:27:04,741 --> 01:27:06,438
Please, just put it away!

1911
01:27:06,569 --> 01:27:07,809
You're gonna fuck us both here!

1912
01:27:18,233 --> 01:27:20,235
She found pot in a bag.

1913
01:27:21,671 --> 01:27:25,152
Her mother did, and then
she found, like, condoms,

1914
01:27:25,283 --> 01:27:27,416
and I don't know,
she's acting out.

1915
01:27:27,546 --> 01:27:28,547
She's just acting out.

1916
01:27:31,855 --> 01:27:33,900
Did my brother...

1917
01:27:35,162 --> 01:27:36,162
What?

1918
01:27:37,513 --> 01:27:40,733
- Did my brother...
- Yeah, I don't know. She said...

1919
01:27:40,864 --> 01:27:43,024
She said she's in love
with an older guy. I don't know.

1920
01:27:44,215 --> 01:27:45,260
Fuck.

1921
01:27:47,000 --> 01:27:50,134
You know,
my father was like that.

1922
01:27:50,265 --> 01:27:51,788
He had whoever he wanted.

1923
01:27:51,918 --> 01:27:54,051
Perhaps I have hundreds

1924
01:27:54,181 --> 01:27:56,401
of half brothers
all over the world.

1925
01:27:57,533 --> 01:27:58,533
That's a scary thought.

1926
01:27:59,665 --> 01:28:01,667
He had no sense
of right and wrong.

1927
01:28:01,798 --> 01:28:03,539
He would always put us
in danger.

1928
01:28:03,669 --> 01:28:06,759
That's how I grew up,
always in danger.

1929
01:28:06,890 --> 01:28:08,010
You know what my father did?

1930
01:28:09,022 --> 01:28:10,022
Hmm?

1931
01:28:10,067 --> 01:28:10,894
- What?
- You know?

1932
01:28:11,024 --> 01:28:14,158
He killed himself.

1933
01:28:14,289 --> 01:28:17,857
He smoked 100 cigarettes
in one day.

1934
01:28:17,988 --> 01:28:20,382
He drank 10 bottles of ouzo.

1935
01:28:21,600 --> 01:28:23,036
In seven days, he was dead.

1936
01:28:26,736 --> 01:28:28,825
You can do whatever you want
with your own life

1937
01:28:28,955 --> 01:28:31,958
but when you start destroying
the lives of other people,

1938
01:28:32,089 --> 01:28:34,091
you have to go.

1939
01:28:35,832 --> 01:28:37,442
Let's go.

1940
01:28:41,359 --> 01:28:42,229
But nothing unusual to report?

1941
01:28:42,360 --> 01:28:43,753
- Nothing...
- No, I don't...

1942
01:28:43,883 --> 01:28:46,756
I mean, are you suggesting
that she

1943
01:28:46,886 --> 01:28:48,037
- intentionally burned a student?
- Oh, I'm not, I'm just...

1944
01:28:48,061 --> 01:28:49,759
No, no, no, no.
I'm actually not at all.

1945
01:28:49,889 --> 01:28:51,891
- I didn't, uh...
- She's a very careful

1946
01:28:52,022 --> 01:28:53,937
and intelligent person.

1947
01:28:54,067 --> 01:28:55,218
Have you been
at the school long?

1948
01:28:55,242 --> 01:28:57,636
- Uh, yes, I have.
- Mm-hmm.

1949
01:28:59,899 --> 01:29:01,597
Too long to count.

1950
01:29:01,727 --> 01:29:02,815
- Oh?
- How's that?

1951
01:29:04,208 --> 01:29:05,427
Uh, I went to school here.

1952
01:29:06,689 --> 01:29:07,994
And you teach English?

1953
01:29:08,125 --> 01:29:10,345
Yes, I teach English.
Let me know if you...

1954
01:29:11,650 --> 01:29:12,825
need any lessons.

1955
01:29:12,956 --> 01:29:13,956
I...

1956
01:29:15,262 --> 01:29:16,422
- It's a joke.
- I know it is.

1957
01:29:16,481 --> 01:29:18,285
It's actually funny because
I've noticed the grammar

1958
01:29:18,309 --> 01:29:19,702
of some of
the students here is...

1959
01:29:19,832 --> 01:29:21,617
Oh, it's suffering.

1960
01:29:21,747 --> 01:29:23,246
- Thank you. I'll review that.
- Yes, but I assume

1961
01:29:23,270 --> 01:29:25,577
it's just a habit,
not, not as a result

1962
01:29:25,708 --> 01:29:27,207
- of your instruction.
- It's hard to teach

1963
01:29:27,231 --> 01:29:28,928
these kids, you know,
proper English

1964
01:29:29,059 --> 01:29:31,017
when they wanna, you know.

1965
01:29:31,148 --> 01:29:34,456
Right, like it's not
very straight to conjugate

1966
01:29:34,586 --> 01:29:35,457
Yeah.

1967
01:29:35,587 --> 01:29:38,677
I'm so sorry. I'm sorry.

1968
01:29:38,808 --> 01:29:40,940
It's just, it's from earlier.
Please continue.

1969
01:29:41,071 --> 01:29:42,151
- Yes, from earlier.
- Yeah.

1970
01:29:49,340 --> 01:29:50,385
What are you doing?

1971
01:29:52,430 --> 01:29:53,710
Babe, we gotta prep
for tomorrow.

1972
01:29:54,780 --> 01:29:56,086
I have to leave.

1973
01:29:56,216 --> 01:29:57,000
What are you talking about?
Where's your apron?

1974
01:29:57,130 --> 01:29:58,393
We got a...

1975
01:29:58,523 --> 01:29:59,935
- we've a shit ton of stuff.
- No, no, no.

1976
01:29:59,959 --> 01:30:01,700
I have to leave.

1977
01:30:01,831 --> 01:30:03,746
I've gotta go. I have
to get out of here, okay?

1978
01:30:03,876 --> 01:30:04,956
What are you talking about?

1979
01:30:05,965 --> 01:30:06,965
Hey, I'm sorry.

1980
01:30:07,053 --> 01:30:08,403
Don't touch me!

1981
01:30:10,274 --> 01:30:11,406
I saw you.

1982
01:30:11,536 --> 01:30:13,059
I saw you. You gave
one of your little

1983
01:30:13,190 --> 01:30:14,626
pill bags to Matty

1984
01:30:14,757 --> 01:30:16,628
and that chick Toni whatever.

1985
01:30:16,759 --> 01:30:18,064
These.

1986
01:30:18,195 --> 01:30:19,718
Your weed and your pills.

1987
01:30:19,849 --> 01:30:21,764
Gave it to the kids!

1988
01:30:21,894 --> 01:30:23,814
You gave it to Matty
and then look what happened.

1989
01:30:25,071 --> 01:30:26,769
You think I caused that?

1990
01:30:26,899 --> 01:30:27,899
- Yeah.
- No.

1991
01:30:31,295 --> 01:30:32,122
They would have been
doing that anyway

1992
01:30:32,252 --> 01:30:33,732
whether they were
taking drugs or not.

1993
01:30:36,735 --> 01:30:37,606
And if they weren't
taking my drugs,

1994
01:30:37,736 --> 01:30:39,085
they'd be taking someone else's,

1995
01:30:39,216 --> 01:30:40,976
and I really believe
that I'm a better person

1996
01:30:41,087 --> 01:30:43,407
to provide them than other
people out there on the streets.

1997
01:30:43,916 --> 01:30:44,916
I'm sorry.

1998
01:30:51,010 --> 01:30:53,099
- Let me come with you.
- No.

1999
01:30:53,230 --> 01:30:54,337
- No, I wanna come with you.
- No, no.

2000
01:30:54,361 --> 01:30:55,885
- Yeah, let me come with you.
- No!

2001
01:30:56,015 --> 01:30:57,756
I know you do,

2002
01:30:57,887 --> 01:30:59,487
but you have
your own stuff to deal with.

2003
01:31:03,022 --> 01:31:04,262
Look at you, you're saving up...

2004
01:31:05,460 --> 01:31:08,071
so that you can go study...

2005
01:31:10,508 --> 01:31:12,684
and you almost have
enough money.

2006
01:31:12,815 --> 01:31:16,688
And then in a few years,
you'll be sitting

2007
01:31:16,819 --> 01:31:18,734
in some little office,

2008
01:31:18,864 --> 01:31:22,825
and you'll have
a little notepad and pencil

2009
01:31:22,955 --> 01:31:25,262
and glasses on a string.

2010
01:31:25,392 --> 01:31:26,872
On a string?

2011
01:31:27,003 --> 01:31:29,353
Yeah, you know, like on a chain.

2012
01:31:29,484 --> 01:31:31,007
I don't wear glasses.

2013
01:31:31,137 --> 01:31:33,257
Well, you'll have to to
look like a real psychiatrist.

2014
01:31:35,054 --> 01:31:36,054
And then...

2015
01:31:41,800 --> 01:31:42,960
one day you'll look up and...

2016
01:31:45,064 --> 01:31:46,109
I'll walk in.

2017
01:31:51,114 --> 01:31:52,115
- Hey.
- Hey.

2018
01:31:52,245 --> 01:31:53,377
Hi.

2019
01:31:53,508 --> 01:31:55,118
Can I show you something?

2020
01:31:55,248 --> 01:31:56,423
Yeah, come in.

2021
01:31:56,554 --> 01:31:59,209
No, it's on, um,
it's on Lisa's computer.

2022
01:32:00,515 --> 01:32:02,429
- Yeah.
- Can you come with me?

2023
01:32:02,560 --> 01:32:03,953
- Sure, are you okay?
- Excuse me?

2024
01:32:04,083 --> 01:32:05,824
- I'm fine.
- Um...

2025
01:32:05,955 --> 01:32:08,827
Do you know how to get
to the principal's office?

2026
01:32:08,958 --> 01:32:12,483
Uh, yeah, from here,
the easiest way is gonna be,

2027
01:32:12,614 --> 01:32:14,485
um, keep going down
this hallway,

2028
01:32:14,616 --> 01:32:16,748
uh, you'll see a doorway
to the stairs,

2029
01:32:16,879 --> 01:32:18,358
take the stairs
two flights down.

2030
01:32:18,489 --> 01:32:20,447
- Two?
- Yeah, two flights down,

2031
01:32:20,578 --> 01:32:23,494
right, and then when you get
to that level,

2032
01:32:23,625 --> 01:32:26,062
right, it's gonna be level two,
you're gonna turn right,

2033
01:32:26,192 --> 01:32:27,890
there's gonna be a double door.

2034
01:32:28,020 --> 01:32:30,849
You want the right door.
You go down that hallway.

2035
01:32:30,980 --> 01:32:34,026
- Um, you'll get to a rotunda.
- Oh, my God.

2036
01:32:34,157 --> 01:32:36,899
Okay, so, down... This is
the easiest way from here.

2037
01:32:37,029 --> 01:32:39,336
- It's just two flights down?
- Where did you come from?

2038
01:32:39,466 --> 01:32:40,119
We're gonna go two flights down?

2039
01:32:40,250 --> 01:32:41,270
Two flights down,
take a right...

2040
01:32:41,294 --> 01:32:42,294
We got it, thank you.

2041
01:32:42,339 --> 01:32:43,427
Go through the rotunda,

2042
01:32:43,558 --> 01:32:44,428
you're gonna come in
at your six o'clock

2043
01:32:44,559 --> 01:32:46,517
and you're gonna go to...
You're welcome.

2044
01:32:46,648 --> 01:32:48,060
There's construction
the other way, so...

2045
01:32:48,084 --> 01:32:49,215
What do you mean?

2046
01:32:49,346 --> 01:32:51,261
Well, like, are we gonna
rehearse for the play?

2047
01:32:51,391 --> 01:32:53,002
Are we gonna cancel the play?

2048
01:32:53,132 --> 01:32:54,212
We have the dress rehearsal.

2049
01:32:54,307 --> 01:32:55,720
- The show is tomorrow.
- We can make time.

2050
01:32:55,744 --> 01:32:57,963
So we're gonna
completely forget about Matty?

2051
01:32:58,094 --> 01:33:01,053
- No one's forgetting about him.
- We haven't forgot about him.

2052
01:33:01,184 --> 01:33:03,316
Wait, wait, wait.
It seems like we don't care.

2053
01:33:03,447 --> 01:33:05,101
It's like now he's not here.

2054
01:33:05,231 --> 01:33:06,557
Well, I mean, that's why
I'm here. I'm the understudy.

2055
01:33:06,581 --> 01:33:09,018
We can sort of do
without a lead.

2056
01:33:09,148 --> 01:33:11,237
Well, I feel like we have
the space open

2057
01:33:11,368 --> 01:33:13,239
where Matty would be,

2058
01:33:13,370 --> 01:33:15,370
and we have someone else
reading the lines for him.

2059
01:33:15,415 --> 01:33:18,418
So it's like he's there
in spirit.

2060
01:33:18,549 --> 01:33:19,811
Something like that.

2061
01:33:22,945 --> 01:33:24,226
Alex, what do you think
about this?

2062
01:33:24,250 --> 01:33:25,512
It doesn't make sense.

2063
01:33:25,643 --> 01:33:27,645
Okay, but you also don't know
a lot of blocking.

2064
01:33:30,256 --> 01:33:32,171
That doesn't make sense!

2065
01:33:32,302 --> 01:33:33,085
Guys, guys, guys!

2066
01:33:33,216 --> 01:33:34,957
- What!
- Guys!

2067
01:33:35,087 --> 01:33:37,007
Calm down, all right.
We have to make a decision.

2068
01:33:37,046 --> 01:33:38,284
- Are we gonna do it or not?
- We can't do it

2069
01:33:38,308 --> 01:33:39,831
without actually
having him here.

2070
01:33:39,962 --> 01:33:41,224
I don't think we should do it.

2071
01:33:41,354 --> 01:33:42,994
We can't do it
without him. It's not fair.

2072
01:33:45,141 --> 01:33:46,141
So what's going on?

2073
01:33:48,274 --> 01:33:49,274
You wanna talk about it?

2074
01:33:51,364 --> 01:33:52,627
I guess.

2075
01:33:59,242 --> 01:34:00,765
Hey, I'm sorry.

2076
01:34:00,896 --> 01:34:01,896
Hi.

2077
01:34:01,984 --> 01:34:03,507
Can we talk for a minute?

2078
01:34:03,638 --> 01:34:04,290
I'm sorry to interrupt.

2079
01:34:04,421 --> 01:34:05,901
Oh, right now?

2080
01:34:06,031 --> 01:34:07,859
Yeah, yeah,
it's pretty important.

2081
01:34:07,990 --> 01:34:09,121
Hey, I'll be right back.

2082
01:34:10,209 --> 01:34:11,209
What's up?

2083
01:34:12,342 --> 01:34:15,650
So Alis found this
on Lisa's computer.

2084
01:34:15,780 --> 01:34:17,564
Apparently, some kids
have been harassing her

2085
01:34:17,695 --> 01:34:21,003
on social media,
on Twitter, Facebook.

2086
01:34:21,133 --> 01:34:22,133
She collected it all.

2087
01:34:22,178 --> 01:34:24,659
There's images and tweets

2088
01:34:24,789 --> 01:34:29,011
and threats, comments
about the way she looks.

2089
01:34:29,141 --> 01:34:30,229
Okay, that's...

2090
01:34:30,360 --> 01:34:31,056
It's pretty upsetting stuff.

2091
01:34:31,187 --> 01:34:32,623
It's pretty ugly.

2092
01:34:32,754 --> 01:34:35,060
Mm-hmm. Yeah.
We just copied it to the USB.

2093
01:34:35,191 --> 01:34:36,496
We should show it to Jess.

2094
01:34:36,627 --> 01:34:37,149
Yeah, absolutely.

2095
01:34:37,280 --> 01:34:38,368
Right?

2096
01:34:38,498 --> 01:34:40,283
Yeah. I think...

2097
01:34:40,413 --> 01:34:42,459
Okay, thank you.
I'll let you know.

2098
01:34:44,591 --> 01:34:46,289
So, uh, um, this is my office.

2099
01:34:46,419 --> 01:34:47,658
Would you like
to sit in your seat?

2100
01:34:47,682 --> 01:34:48,508
- That's great, thank you.
- Nice,

2101
01:34:48,639 --> 01:34:49,379
yes, you're very welcome.

2102
01:34:49,509 --> 01:34:50,549
- Thank you.
- Have a seat.

2103
01:34:51,947 --> 01:34:54,166
And I'm powerless
in this situation.

2104
01:34:54,297 --> 01:34:56,995
I'm sort of like Harvey Keitel
in Pulp Fiction.

2105
01:34:57,126 --> 01:34:58,726
I clean up the mess,
but I have no power.

2106
01:34:58,780 --> 01:35:00,999
So I'm just gonna sit
right here.

2107
01:35:01,130 --> 01:35:03,349
So, it would seem
we have a mess to clean up?

2108
01:35:03,480 --> 01:35:05,221
Uh, no, that's not what I said.

2109
01:35:05,351 --> 01:35:06,526
I said I'm powerless.

2110
01:35:06,657 --> 01:35:07,789
That should make you happy.

2111
01:35:08,877 --> 01:35:11,053
Thank you for letting us
use your office.

2112
01:35:11,183 --> 01:35:12,750
Absolutely.

2113
01:35:12,881 --> 01:35:15,361
How did you feel about
the response to the explosion?

2114
01:35:15,492 --> 01:35:18,234
Did everything go according
to protocol, according to plan?

2115
01:35:18,364 --> 01:35:20,497
Were there any glitches?

2116
01:35:20,627 --> 01:35:21,890
As far as I can tell,

2117
01:35:22,020 --> 01:35:23,302
everything went
according to plan.

2118
01:35:23,326 --> 01:35:25,023
- Mm-hmm.
- Um,

2119
01:35:25,154 --> 01:35:28,461
the school safety desk
at the front,

2120
01:35:28,592 --> 01:35:30,637
at the entrance...

2121
01:35:30,768 --> 01:35:32,093
received a call
pretty immediately

2122
01:35:32,117 --> 01:35:35,033
that an accident was happening
on the fourth floor.

2123
01:35:35,164 --> 01:35:37,470
They called FDNY
and NYPD immediately.

2124
01:35:37,601 --> 01:35:39,081
They were here within minutes,

2125
01:35:39,211 --> 01:35:41,344
and everything went
according to protocol

2126
01:35:41,474 --> 01:35:43,781
as far as I can see.

2127
01:35:43,912 --> 01:35:46,044
And when did you respond
to the fourth floor?

2128
01:35:47,698 --> 01:35:50,222
I was not in the building
at the time of the accident.

2129
01:35:51,528 --> 01:35:53,182
The AP was there.
He's not required

2130
01:35:53,312 --> 01:35:54,879
to be there in the morning.

2131
01:35:55,010 --> 01:35:57,142
You could designate an AP.

2132
01:35:57,273 --> 01:35:59,579
I didn't, uh, suggest
that he was required

2133
01:35:59,710 --> 01:36:00,870
- to be in the school.
- Okay.

2134
01:36:01,930 --> 01:36:04,149
There was a...

2135
01:36:04,280 --> 01:36:06,543
There was an emergency.

2136
01:36:06,673 --> 01:36:07,805
I was away.

2137
01:36:09,067 --> 01:36:11,243
What, what kind
of, uh, emergency?

2138
01:36:11,374 --> 01:36:13,463
What does that have
to do with this incident?

2139
01:36:13,593 --> 01:36:15,030
My wife was in the hospital.

2140
01:36:16,814 --> 01:36:19,599
Look, my wife had...
my ex-wife.

2141
01:36:19,730 --> 01:36:21,514
No, you don't get
into personal business.

2142
01:36:21,645 --> 01:36:23,125
We're talking about an incident.

2143
01:36:23,255 --> 01:36:24,648
He wasn't there.
There was a,

2144
01:36:24,779 --> 01:36:26,365
- there was a supervisor on site.
- Look, my ex-wife

2145
01:36:26,389 --> 01:36:27,829
had tried
to kill herself, all right?

2146
01:36:27,869 --> 01:36:28,957
On the day of the incident?

2147
01:36:29,087 --> 01:36:30,088
No. No.

2148
01:36:30,219 --> 01:36:32,438
Like three weeks ago

2149
01:36:32,569 --> 01:36:33,875
and I was picking her up.

2150
01:36:35,485 --> 01:36:36,485
Is she all right?

2151
01:36:41,752 --> 01:36:45,408
We were... pregnant,

2152
01:36:45,538 --> 01:36:46,538
and she...

2153
01:36:49,542 --> 01:36:50,805
we lost it.

2154
01:37:28,581 --> 01:37:30,540
I'm, uh, having
an abortion tonight.

2155
01:37:35,284 --> 01:37:37,503
I was supposed to be there
like an hour ago, actually.

2156
01:38:06,750 --> 01:38:08,143
You know, I never wanted Matty?

2157
01:38:15,585 --> 01:38:16,585
I never wanted him.

2158
01:38:24,420 --> 01:38:26,074
Even after he was born.

2159
01:38:26,204 --> 01:38:27,205
When he was born...

2160
01:38:29,294 --> 01:38:30,532
I loved him more than
anything in the world

2161
01:38:30,556 --> 01:38:32,428
and I still do.

2162
01:38:32,558 --> 01:38:34,560
But there was always
this bit of resentment I had.

2163
01:38:39,391 --> 01:38:41,393
So stupid.

2164
01:38:45,832 --> 01:38:46,921
And now...

2165
01:38:55,712 --> 01:38:56,974
and now he's...

2166
01:39:00,369 --> 01:39:02,937
he's not who he used to be.

2167
01:39:05,809 --> 01:39:08,638
This was the last place he was
when he was who he was.

2168
01:39:08,768 --> 01:39:10,945
When he was...

2169
01:39:55,119 --> 01:39:56,251
It's my, it's my fault.

2170
01:39:56,381 --> 01:39:57,774
It's my fault.

2171
01:39:59,906 --> 01:40:01,125
Tell me why you're saying that.

2172
01:40:21,798 --> 01:40:24,279
Did you have
any reason to suspect

2173
01:40:24,409 --> 01:40:26,411
that Miss Dhawan
was being bullied?

2174
01:40:26,542 --> 01:40:28,102
What does that have
to do with anything?

2175
01:40:29,588 --> 01:40:31,460
Do you know J.C. Caraballo?

2176
01:40:33,331 --> 01:40:34,811
I'm aware of who he is.

2177
01:40:34,941 --> 01:40:36,552
He's a student here.

2178
01:40:36,682 --> 01:40:38,728
And do you, do you know him?

2179
01:40:38,858 --> 01:40:40,338
I-I know who he is.

2180
01:40:43,776 --> 01:40:44,776
Hey, guys.

2181
01:40:47,519 --> 01:40:48,781
What the fuck?

2182
01:40:48,912 --> 01:40:49,739
That did not go well.

2183
01:40:49,869 --> 01:40:51,436
Tha-tha-that just went about

2184
01:40:51,567 --> 01:40:53,873
as terrible as it
possibly could!

2185
01:40:54,004 --> 01:40:56,050
- Easy! It is what it is.
- It is what it is?

2186
01:40:56,180 --> 01:40:57,940
Are you kidding me?
She was, she was, she was...

2187
01:40:57,964 --> 01:41:00,271
They got my balls
in their hands!

2188
01:41:00,402 --> 01:41:02,534
They're-they're-they're-they're grabbing,

2189
01:41:02,665 --> 01:41:04,275
and they're squeezing!

2190
01:41:04,406 --> 01:41:06,451
- Easy.
- Easy!

2191
01:41:06,582 --> 01:41:07,733
- Just move on to the next thing.
- Where the fuck is Amy?

2192
01:41:07,757 --> 01:41:09,019
Where's my wife?

2193
01:41:09,150 --> 01:41:10,716
She cannot be wandering
the halls!

2194
01:41:10,847 --> 01:41:12,631
Heather, Heather!

2195
01:41:12,762 --> 01:41:14,372
Oh, and of course
on top of all that,

2196
01:41:14,503 --> 01:41:16,418
now I've got this charge
for domestic violence

2197
01:41:16,548 --> 01:41:18,028
hanging over my head.

2198
01:41:18,159 --> 01:41:19,986
Hey, there's no way
she's gonna report that.

2199
01:41:20,117 --> 01:41:22,859
If she did,
they'd deport J.C.'s father!

2200
01:41:22,989 --> 01:41:24,426
She's aware of that,
you told her!

2201
01:41:24,556 --> 01:41:26,384
- Yeah, but...
- Easy.

2202
01:41:28,560 --> 01:41:29,560
Whew!

2203
01:41:31,563 --> 01:41:32,563
I'm fucked.

2204
01:41:57,023 --> 01:41:58,199
Fuck.

2205
01:42:00,026 --> 01:42:01,115
Fuck.

2206
01:42:02,333 --> 01:42:03,726
Fuck.

2207
01:42:03,856 --> 01:42:05,336
Fuck.

2208
01:42:05,467 --> 01:42:07,251
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck!

2209
01:42:07,382 --> 01:42:08,557
Fuck!

2210
01:42:08,687 --> 01:42:09,687
Oh, fuck.

2211
01:42:11,951 --> 01:42:14,476
Yeah, I think we need
to really stick to the facts

2212
01:42:14,606 --> 01:42:18,828
'cause we're getting
into her emotional state

2213
01:42:18,958 --> 01:42:20,873
and the kids' emotional state,

2214
01:42:21,004 --> 01:42:22,571
and that's like, that's not...

2215
01:42:22,701 --> 01:42:25,269
Okay, um, do you...

2216
01:42:26,792 --> 01:42:28,553
So you put the keys away
on the day of the incident...

2217
01:42:28,577 --> 01:42:29,641
- Yes.
- after you locked

2218
01:42:29,665 --> 01:42:30,665
- the cabinet?
- I, I,

2219
01:42:30,753 --> 01:42:33,147
I put the keys
in the office room

2220
01:42:33,277 --> 01:42:35,584
with the other keys
in the faculty room, yes.

2221
01:42:37,107 --> 01:42:38,848
Okay. And that's where
you always keep them?

2222
01:42:38,978 --> 01:42:40,589
I us... Yes, usually.

2223
01:42:40,719 --> 01:42:42,068
I usually do that.

2224
01:42:42,199 --> 01:42:43,199
- Usually?
- Usually?

2225
01:42:44,070 --> 01:42:45,289
Yes.

2226
01:42:46,682 --> 01:42:48,945
Yes, she has a routine.
She followed the routine.

2227
01:42:49,075 --> 01:42:49,902
Yes, there are rules,

2228
01:42:50,033 --> 01:42:52,688
and there are rules about...

2229
01:42:52,818 --> 01:42:54,492
There are rules about
how to put the keys away.

2230
01:42:54,516 --> 01:42:55,952
I'm sorry, I'm very tired...

2231
01:42:56,082 --> 01:42:57,843
No, right, no, of course.
And I'm just saying...

2232
01:42:57,867 --> 01:43:00,696
And I followed the rules
about how to store the keys.

2233
01:43:00,826 --> 01:43:03,107
No, I mean, I hear that you're
saying what you usually do,

2234
01:43:03,220 --> 01:43:04,893
but do you remember
specifically on that day

2235
01:43:04,917 --> 01:43:06,237
because, I mean,
I know, routines,

2236
01:43:06,267 --> 01:43:08,138
you can kinda get lost
in the routine,

2237
01:43:08,269 --> 01:43:10,923
and you don't do it
sometimes, and...

2238
01:43:11,054 --> 01:43:12,795
Do you remember
doing it on that day?

2239
01:43:14,492 --> 01:43:15,798
Ye-Yes.

2240
01:43:15,928 --> 01:43:16,928
You do?

2241
01:43:17,800 --> 01:43:18,888
Yes, I mean...

2242
01:43:20,281 --> 01:43:23,632
- Except...
- You can answer the question,

2243
01:43:23,762 --> 01:43:26,025
but you keeping asking her
50 different ways,

2244
01:43:26,156 --> 01:43:27,766
she's giving you
the same answer.

2245
01:43:27,897 --> 01:43:28,897
Except what?

2246
01:43:30,943 --> 01:43:32,206
Except there was...

2247
01:43:35,165 --> 01:43:36,993
Except there was what?

2248
01:43:37,123 --> 01:43:39,213
- I was running late for class...
- Mm-hmm.

2249
01:43:39,343 --> 01:43:42,477
And in some
of the student evaluations,

2250
01:43:42,607 --> 01:43:45,958
there was something
about me being late,

2251
01:43:46,089 --> 01:43:49,614
so I, I had the keys with me

2252
01:43:49,745 --> 01:43:53,575
and I left them on the desk
in the classroom.

2253
01:43:53,705 --> 01:43:55,272
In room 42?

2254
01:43:55,403 --> 01:43:59,189
Th-The classroom I was in
prior to the one I was going to.

2255
01:43:59,320 --> 01:44:02,018
- Okay.
- And, uh, they were on my desk

2256
01:44:02,148 --> 01:44:03,846
but only for the duration
of the class

2257
01:44:03,976 --> 01:44:05,978
because after the class
I came back,

2258
01:44:06,109 --> 01:44:08,024
and they were still
where I left them

2259
01:44:08,154 --> 01:44:09,939
and then I put them away.

2260
01:44:10,069 --> 01:44:11,332
So they were on the desk...

2261
01:44:12,942 --> 01:44:14,073
during the class period?

2262
01:44:14,204 --> 01:44:15,204
Yeah.

2263
01:44:16,467 --> 01:44:18,991
But when you came back,
so you left the room?

2264
01:44:19,122 --> 01:44:20,863
For just a short period of time,

2265
01:44:20,993 --> 01:44:23,213
and then when the class was over
and I came back,

2266
01:44:23,344 --> 01:44:25,215
they were still
where I left them.

2267
01:44:25,346 --> 01:44:27,826
So they were left
unattended in an open room

2268
01:44:27,957 --> 01:44:29,369
for the duration
of the class period?

2269
01:44:29,393 --> 01:44:31,113
Yes, but they were exactly
where I left them

2270
01:44:31,221 --> 01:44:32,962
when I came back so...

2271
01:44:33,092 --> 01:44:34,616
And was there another class

2272
01:44:34,746 --> 01:44:36,158
- in that other classroom...
- No, no,

2273
01:44:36,182 --> 01:44:36,835
- at that time?
- There was not.

2274
01:44:36,966 --> 01:44:37,966
So it was empty?

2275
01:44:38,054 --> 01:44:39,054
Yeah.

2276
01:44:40,622 --> 01:44:42,022
They were...
I knew where they were.

2277
01:44:42,058 --> 01:44:44,190
I-I-I was running late,

2278
01:44:44,321 --> 01:44:45,844
so I didn't want
to be late for class.

2279
01:44:52,242 --> 01:44:53,417
I love being a teacher.

2280
01:44:59,902 --> 01:45:01,773
Okay, what?

2281
01:45:01,904 --> 01:45:04,472
He made a copy of the key,
and then he put it back.

2282
01:45:04,602 --> 01:45:06,212
Who, who, when...

2283
01:45:06,343 --> 01:45:08,780
Are you saying that
Matty did that?

2284
01:45:08,911 --> 01:45:10,129
Yeah.

2285
01:45:10,260 --> 01:45:12,262
But there wasn't really
a plan or anything.

2286
01:45:12,393 --> 01:45:14,308
We were just kinda
messing around.

2287
01:45:15,613 --> 01:45:16,613
Smoking weed.

2288
01:45:21,010 --> 01:45:22,010
And then...

2289
01:45:22,098 --> 01:45:23,098
Did you go?

2290
01:45:24,100 --> 01:45:26,145
No, I was grounded.

2291
01:45:26,276 --> 01:45:27,601
- Oh, my God.
- They're not gonna deport you.

2292
01:45:27,625 --> 01:45:29,211
- Why would they deport you?
- They'll fucking deport me, bro.

2293
01:45:29,235 --> 01:45:29,932
No, they're not gonna
deport you...

2294
01:45:30,062 --> 01:45:31,499
What are you talking about?

2295
01:45:31,629 --> 01:45:33,085
As long as you don't talk shit,
they won't be able to.

2296
01:45:33,109 --> 01:45:33,979
- Then of course not.
- I didn't say anything.

2297
01:45:34,110 --> 01:45:35,110
You didn't say anything?

2298
01:45:35,154 --> 01:45:36,474
What's so bad
about Mexico anyway?

2299
01:45:36,547 --> 01:45:38,438
What the fuck? Have you been
to fucking Mexico, bro?

2300
01:45:38,462 --> 01:45:40,048
I wouldn't last a day.
Imagine what you would.

2301
01:45:40,072 --> 01:45:41,683
You wouldn't even
fucking last an hour!

2302
01:45:41,813 --> 01:45:42,813
You need to chill.

2303
01:45:42,901 --> 01:45:44,096
Don't tell me
to fucking chill, bro?

2304
01:45:44,120 --> 01:45:45,513
Take it down a notch.

2305
01:45:47,341 --> 01:45:49,014
What the fuck are you
talking about my dad for?

2306
01:45:49,038 --> 01:45:50,711
Look at your fucking eye!
Look at your eye!

2307
01:45:50,735 --> 01:45:52,015
Are you in my fucking situation?

2308
01:45:52,041 --> 01:45:53,061
- Look at your eye!
- What?

2309
01:45:53,085 --> 01:45:54,193
- You're gonna defend him?
- What the fuck.

2310
01:45:54,217 --> 01:45:56,175
'Cause your dad is an asshole!

2311
01:45:56,306 --> 01:45:57,675
You don't know
what the fuck he does to me!

2312
01:45:57,699 --> 01:45:58,526
- You know it!
- What?

2313
01:45:58,656 --> 01:45:59,831
Don't push me.

2314
01:45:59,962 --> 01:46:00,982
- Don't push me.
- Wanna get fucking physical?

2315
01:46:01,006 --> 01:46:02,965
You know that your dad's a dick.

2316
01:46:03,095 --> 01:46:04,295
You're not in my fucking house!

2317
01:46:04,358 --> 01:46:05,552
You're not in my fucking house...

2318
01:46:05,576 --> 01:46:06,838
Everybody knows the situation.

2319
01:46:06,969 --> 01:46:08,889
You don't know what
I've been through, all right?

2320
01:46:08,971 --> 01:46:10,078
- So shut the fuck up!
- It doesn't matter!

2321
01:46:10,102 --> 01:46:11,626
- Shut up!
- You like going through it?

2322
01:46:11,756 --> 01:46:13,105
- You like it?
- Shut the fuck up!

2323
01:46:13,236 --> 01:46:14,280
- Really?
- Shut up!

2324
01:46:14,411 --> 01:46:15,673
You sound real familiar, right?

2325
01:46:15,804 --> 01:46:16,998
I bet you hear that
all the time, right?

2326
01:46:17,022 --> 01:46:18,372
Oh, my fucking God.

2327
01:46:18,502 --> 01:46:20,175
- That sound real familiar...
- Keep talking shit,

2328
01:46:20,199 --> 01:46:21,742
I swear to God I'm gonna knock
the fuck outta you.

2329
01:46:21,766 --> 01:46:23,855
You sound just like
your little pops.

2330
01:46:23,986 --> 01:46:25,093
- Don't push me.
- Shut the fuck up!

2331
01:46:25,117 --> 01:46:26,249
- Don't push me.
- Shut up!

2332
01:46:26,380 --> 01:46:27,250
Now you're gonna make me...

2333
01:46:27,381 --> 01:46:28,643
Gonna fucking fall, bitch.

2334
01:46:28,773 --> 01:46:30,296
- What, what?
- No, chill. Chill!

2335
01:46:30,427 --> 01:46:31,297
- Fuck you mean chill?
- Chill!

2336
01:46:31,428 --> 01:46:32,536
Don't tell me
what the fuck to do.

2337
01:46:32,560 --> 01:46:33,865
It's not even
that big of a deal.

2338
01:46:33,996 --> 01:46:35,974
What the fuck you mean
it's not that big of a deal?

2339
01:46:35,998 --> 01:46:37,173
Because it was Matty's idea!

2340
01:46:37,303 --> 01:46:38,411
What the fuck
are you trying to say?

2341
01:46:38,435 --> 01:46:39,755
We were there too.
It's our fault!

2342
01:46:39,784 --> 01:46:41,064
- So?
- We didn't say no, did we?

2343
01:46:41,090 --> 01:46:42,284
- No, we didn't say no.
- All right then.

2344
01:46:42,308 --> 01:46:43,460
What the fuck,
it's our fault too.

2345
01:46:43,484 --> 01:46:44,809
- You need to chill.
- No, you need

2346
01:46:44,833 --> 01:46:46,332
- to fucking chill...
- You need to chill.

2347
01:46:46,356 --> 01:46:48,196
- You really need to chill.
- I swear to God...

2348
01:46:49,533 --> 01:46:51,448
- Your gun!
- I don't know where it is.

2349
01:46:53,015 --> 01:46:54,993
- How did you let this happen?
- I don't know. I...

2350
01:46:55,017 --> 01:46:57,019
How could you possibly
let this happen?

2351
01:46:57,149 --> 01:46:59,630
That is like
the most important part

2352
01:46:59,761 --> 01:47:01,850
of your entire job!

2353
01:47:01,980 --> 01:47:05,331
We are police officers
at an educational institution

2354
01:47:05,462 --> 01:47:07,812
in charge
of monitoring children,

2355
01:47:07,943 --> 01:47:09,223
and now your gun
is on the loose.

2356
01:47:09,248 --> 01:47:11,425
Are you out of your mind?

2357
01:47:20,259 --> 01:47:21,870
Oh, shit. It's stuck.

2358
01:47:23,132 --> 01:47:24,568
It's stuck!

2359
01:47:24,699 --> 01:47:26,918
Holy shit.

2360
01:47:27,049 --> 01:47:31,009
They said, what if we messed
around with the chemicals

2361
01:47:31,140 --> 01:47:33,664
and played a joke
on Miss D because...

2362
01:47:33,795 --> 01:47:35,013
A joke?

2363
01:47:35,144 --> 01:47:37,929
Not really a joke, but...

2364
01:47:38,060 --> 01:47:39,298
they just wanted
to get back at her

2365
01:47:39,322 --> 01:47:43,021
because she had told
the principal

2366
01:47:43,152 --> 01:47:45,676
on J.C. for acting out in class

2367
01:47:45,807 --> 01:47:48,462
and then his dad beat
him up really bad,

2368
01:47:48,592 --> 01:47:51,029
but he was only acting up
in class because...

2369
01:47:53,597 --> 01:47:56,426
The only reason that
he was acting out in class

2370
01:47:56,557 --> 01:48:00,386
was because Miss D
caught me smoking

2371
01:48:00,517 --> 01:48:02,737
and then she told
my dad and then...

2372
01:48:04,347 --> 01:48:06,392
and then my mom found out,

2373
01:48:06,523 --> 01:48:08,525
and then I had
to go live with her.

2374
01:48:13,487 --> 01:48:16,490
So who was actually there,
Matty and who else?

2375
01:48:34,159 --> 01:48:35,509
What are you doing?

2376
01:48:38,468 --> 01:48:41,166
We had quite an evil eye on us.

2377
01:48:41,297 --> 01:48:43,038
That's why it happened.

2378
01:48:43,168 --> 01:48:44,822
Evil eye, you know.

2379
01:48:44,953 --> 01:48:47,303
Bad energy. Evil eye,
bad energy, you know.

2380
01:48:47,433 --> 01:48:48,565
- An evil eye.
- Yeah.

2381
01:48:49,871 --> 01:48:50,871
- Is on us.
- Yeah.

2382
01:48:52,221 --> 01:48:54,832
- Elevator got stuck.
- Exactly.

2383
01:48:54,963 --> 01:48:57,269
Awesome. That's great.
That's great.

2384
01:48:57,400 --> 01:48:59,489
In five minutes, we'll be okay.

2385
01:49:04,886 --> 01:49:07,541
Everything happens for a reason.

2386
01:49:09,238 --> 01:49:10,848
I'm not talking to you anymore.

2387
01:49:12,067 --> 01:49:13,067
- Hey.
- Hi.

2388
01:49:15,070 --> 01:49:17,333
- How are you doing?
- Uh, good.

2389
01:49:17,463 --> 01:49:21,555
Uh, do you have
Ross Fairchild's contact info?

2390
01:49:22,991 --> 01:49:24,645
Maybe. Why?

2391
01:49:26,560 --> 01:49:29,867
I-I found something of Matty's,

2392
01:49:29,998 --> 01:49:33,088
and I wanted to give it
back to the family.

2393
01:49:34,916 --> 01:49:37,135
Um, I mean, I could
give that to them

2394
01:49:37,266 --> 01:49:38,506
if you wanted to give it to me.

2395
01:49:39,573 --> 01:49:41,096
Uh, it's just really personal,

2396
01:49:41,226 --> 01:49:42,967
and I'd prefer...

2397
01:49:43,098 --> 01:49:44,498
I'd prefer to give it
to him myself,

2398
01:49:45,317 --> 01:49:46,362
if you don't mind.

2399
01:49:46,492 --> 01:49:47,581
Um...

2400
01:49:49,539 --> 01:49:51,933
yeah, I mean, I guess
that should be okay.

2401
01:49:52,063 --> 01:49:53,063
Hang on.

2402
01:49:54,326 --> 01:49:55,545
I can write it down.

2403
01:49:55,676 --> 01:49:56,876
That would be great.
Thank you.

2404
01:50:00,158 --> 01:50:02,117
You don't believe in that, why?

2405
01:50:02,247 --> 01:50:04,728
Why you don't believe that
everything happens for a reason?

2406
01:50:04,859 --> 01:50:06,251
Explain to me, please.

2407
01:50:06,382 --> 01:50:09,428
Because it doesn't...

2408
01:50:09,559 --> 01:50:12,910
What you're saying
doesn't make any sense.

2409
01:50:13,041 --> 01:50:15,304
It is like
you don't believe in love.

2410
01:50:15,434 --> 01:50:16,827
You don't believe in love?

2411
01:50:16,958 --> 01:50:19,177
With love, you can...

2412
01:50:19,308 --> 01:50:20,868
- you can create miracles.
- Oh, my God.

2413
01:50:20,962 --> 01:50:23,094
This now, this is my hell.

2414
01:50:23,225 --> 01:50:24,225
This is my hell.

2415
01:50:25,444 --> 01:50:26,444
Was it just weed?

2416
01:50:28,273 --> 01:50:29,274
No.

2417
01:50:29,405 --> 01:50:30,405
No?

2418
01:50:33,409 --> 01:50:35,324
You have something
on you. What is that?

2419
01:50:36,978 --> 01:50:38,018
Give me that.
What is that?

2420
01:50:39,502 --> 01:50:40,634
It's...

2421
01:50:41,547 --> 01:50:42,636
it's not Tylenol.

2422
01:50:52,167 --> 01:50:53,167
It's just...

2423
01:50:56,040 --> 01:50:57,040
Matty...

2424
01:50:58,216 --> 01:50:59,216
he...

2425
01:51:01,480 --> 01:51:02,960
he likes me, you know?

2426
01:51:03,091 --> 01:51:04,135
And he...

2427
01:51:08,009 --> 01:51:11,229
he just wanted
to show me that, you know,

2428
01:51:12,491 --> 01:51:13,841
he wouldn't let anybody...

2429
01:51:15,364 --> 01:51:16,364
mess around with me.

2430
01:51:18,019 --> 01:51:20,195
People make choices.
That's why, okay.

2431
01:51:20,325 --> 01:51:21,544
Everybody makes a choice.

2432
01:51:21,675 --> 01:51:23,502
Choices affect other people.

2433
01:51:23,633 --> 01:51:26,027
Okay. It's not some grand plan.

2434
01:51:26,157 --> 01:51:29,770
It's not some deeper meaning
when shit happens.

2435
01:51:30,945 --> 01:51:31,945
Hi.

2436
01:51:35,601 --> 01:51:38,953
I'm sure they will
let us out soon.

2437
01:51:39,083 --> 01:51:40,694
Don't cry.

2438
01:51:42,043 --> 01:51:44,001
It's okay. It's okay.

2439
01:51:54,316 --> 01:51:55,316
We...

2440
01:51:58,189 --> 01:51:59,190
You okay?

2441
01:51:59,321 --> 01:52:01,192
Uh...

2442
01:52:03,412 --> 01:52:05,719
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, I'm okay.

2443
01:52:07,285 --> 01:52:09,026
Uh...

2444
01:52:10,593 --> 01:52:11,725
What?

2445
01:52:21,647 --> 01:52:22,823
I fucked up.

2446
01:52:24,346 --> 01:52:25,671
You lose the glasses,
or I take them off your face.

2447
01:52:25,695 --> 01:52:26,933
I'm pretty sure
you can't tell me what to do.

2448
01:52:26,957 --> 01:52:27,957
It's your...

2449
01:52:29,177 --> 01:52:31,092
- Right now?
- Don't make me say it again.

2450
01:52:31,222 --> 01:52:33,747
- Oh, sass.
- Thank you.

2451
01:52:33,877 --> 01:52:35,717
- Can I just hold 'em?
- No, no, no, you can't.

2452
01:52:37,402 --> 01:52:39,361
Meanwhile, uh, Lawrence?

2453
01:52:39,491 --> 01:52:40,491
Miss Dhawan's keys?

2454
01:52:41,929 --> 01:52:42,756
Yeah.

2455
01:52:42,886 --> 01:52:43,886
What happened to them?

2456
01:52:44,975 --> 01:52:46,107
Who knows?

2457
01:52:46,237 --> 01:52:49,327
It was Matty. He, uh,
he got, he got 'em.

2458
01:52:49,458 --> 01:52:51,460
He had the keys.
Do you know how he

2459
01:52:51,590 --> 01:52:52,461
came into possession
of the keys?

2460
01:52:52,591 --> 01:52:54,680
- No.
- No? Okay.

2461
01:52:54,811 --> 01:52:57,292
Uh, but he accessed
the supply closet

2462
01:52:57,422 --> 01:52:58,422
in the science lab?

2463
01:52:59,990 --> 01:53:01,165
That was me.

2464
01:53:01,296 --> 01:53:02,514
- It was you?
- Yeah.

2465
01:53:02,645 --> 01:53:03,864
He gave you the keys?

2466
01:53:04,734 --> 01:53:06,127
We-We all were together.

2467
01:53:08,129 --> 01:53:09,129
Keys?

2468
01:53:10,784 --> 01:53:12,437
How would I know about the keys?

2469
01:53:12,568 --> 01:53:13,568
You know about the keys?

2470
01:53:14,918 --> 01:53:17,355
All right, so here's
the situation, J.C.

2471
01:53:17,486 --> 01:53:20,228
As you said yourself
in the locker room,

2472
01:53:20,358 --> 01:53:23,448
you are an accomplice
in this crime

2473
01:53:23,579 --> 01:53:25,015
which has been committed,

2474
01:53:25,146 --> 01:53:28,453
so it is to your advantage
to be forthcoming

2475
01:53:28,584 --> 01:53:30,325
in this situation.

2476
01:53:30,455 --> 01:53:34,329
This is like when you watch TV
and there's a cop drama,

2477
01:53:34,459 --> 01:53:37,680
this is like that,
only this is your life.

2478
01:53:37,811 --> 01:53:41,553
I know your status. I know
the status of your father

2479
01:53:41,684 --> 01:53:43,468
and I need you
to be forthcoming,

2480
01:53:43,599 --> 01:53:45,253
or there may be
serious consequences.

2481
01:53:45,383 --> 01:53:47,211
Do you understand
what I am saying to you

2482
01:53:47,342 --> 01:53:49,387
or do I need
to be more explicit?

2483
01:53:49,518 --> 01:53:50,693
I understand the words.

2484
01:53:50,824 --> 01:53:51,975
I just don't know
where they're coming from.

2485
01:53:51,999 --> 01:53:54,159
- I don't think you know...
- You're trying to go back?

2486
01:53:54,392 --> 01:53:55,392
Oh, okay.

2487
01:53:56,568 --> 01:53:57,568
You guys all right?

2488
01:53:59,963 --> 01:54:01,747
No, Lawrence
just has some jokes.

2489
01:54:01,878 --> 01:54:03,290
No, I don't have anything
to joke about now.

2490
01:54:03,314 --> 01:54:04,794
I mean...

2491
01:54:04,925 --> 01:54:06,119
Lawrence recognizes the severity

2492
01:54:06,143 --> 01:54:07,753
of the situation, J.C.

2493
01:54:07,884 --> 01:54:09,799
- You can drop the act.
- There's no act.

2494
01:54:09,930 --> 01:54:11,627
You can drop this bravado
that you have.

2495
01:54:11,757 --> 01:54:12,757
There is no act.

2496
01:54:12,846 --> 01:54:14,412
There is actually no protecting

2497
01:54:14,543 --> 01:54:15,583
your father at this point.

2498
01:54:15,674 --> 01:54:17,981
He's under investigation.

2499
01:54:18,112 --> 01:54:20,592
It's in motion, all right?

2500
01:54:20,723 --> 01:54:23,334
We are here talking
to you right now,

2501
01:54:23,465 --> 01:54:24,727
in this case.

2502
01:54:24,858 --> 01:54:26,163
In the case with your father,

2503
01:54:26,294 --> 01:54:27,469
you are the victim.

2504
01:54:27,599 --> 01:54:28,839
Now, in the case of this school,

2505
01:54:28,905 --> 01:54:31,865
you are potentially
a perpetrator.

2506
01:54:33,214 --> 01:54:35,303
I suggest that you start
telling the truth,

2507
01:54:35,433 --> 01:54:37,113
the whole truth,
and nothing but the truth.

2508
01:54:39,220 --> 01:54:40,220
So help me God.

2509
01:54:42,963 --> 01:54:44,323
Let's go, all right,
that's enough.

2510
01:54:45,704 --> 01:54:47,358
They're looking for the truth.

2511
01:54:47,489 --> 01:54:49,360
The only problem is,
what is the truth?

2512
01:54:49,491 --> 01:54:50,598
Theoretically, I'm the only
person that could tell them,

2513
01:54:50,622 --> 01:54:52,059
and I can't speak.

2514
01:54:52,189 --> 01:54:53,321
Does it start with me?

2515
01:54:53,451 --> 01:54:55,453
Or does it start
with Adam smiling at Toni?

2516
01:54:55,584 --> 01:54:57,281
Or Shannon hiring Adam.

2517
01:54:57,412 --> 01:54:59,283
Or Miss D telling on Toni?

2518
01:54:59,414 --> 01:55:01,198
Or Toni's dad grounding Toni?

2519
01:55:01,329 --> 01:55:02,889
Or her mom taking her
away from her dad?

2520
01:55:02,983 --> 01:55:04,351
Or Principal Williamson overreacting

2521
01:55:04,375 --> 01:55:05,526
because he's mad at his wife!

2522
01:55:05,550 --> 01:55:07,204
Who can you blame?

2523
01:55:07,335 --> 01:55:08,878
If Heather hadn't made
that noise that night,

2524
01:55:08,902 --> 01:55:10,302
the first beaker
would have exploded

2525
01:55:10,338 --> 01:55:11,730
as planned.

2526
01:55:11,861 --> 01:55:13,447
And Miss D would have been
wearing protective gear,

2527
01:55:13,471 --> 01:55:15,511
and I would have been
on the other end of the table!

2528
01:55:15,560 --> 01:55:17,432
Whatever.

2529
01:55:17,562 --> 01:55:19,782
The only questions that's worth
its weight is this,

2530
01:55:19,913 --> 01:55:21,871
is there a fucking script,

2531
01:55:22,002 --> 01:55:22,785
or does everything
happen by accident?

2532
01:55:22,916 --> 01:55:24,134
One thing leading to another,

2533
01:55:24,265 --> 01:55:25,875
a simple chain reaction.

2534
01:55:26,006 --> 01:55:27,355
And if it does happen
by accident,

2535
01:55:27,485 --> 01:55:29,115
why does one accident happen
and not another?

2536
01:55:29,139 --> 01:55:30,139
Why me?

2537
01:55:31,402 --> 01:55:32,402
Why the hell me?

2538
01:55:33,839 --> 01:55:36,190
That's actually
fucking great. Let's go!

2539
01:55:36,320 --> 01:55:37,669
- Shh!
- Let's go!

2540
01:55:37,800 --> 01:55:39,193
Fuck, bro.

2541
01:55:39,323 --> 01:55:40,387
Yo, there's a ghost in here.

2542
01:55:40,411 --> 01:55:41,586
What?

2543
01:55:41,717 --> 01:55:42,999
What the fuck you mean
there's a ghost in here?

2544
01:55:43,023 --> 01:55:44,676
What are you, a pussy?
Come on, man.

2545
01:55:44,807 --> 01:55:46,002
What the fuck
you mean am I a pussy?

2546
01:55:46,026 --> 01:55:47,462
What the fuck?
Of course I'm not...

2547
01:55:47,592 --> 01:55:48,593
I'm not a fucking bitch.

2548
01:55:49,812 --> 01:55:51,248
Shut the fuck up.

2549
01:55:54,904 --> 01:55:55,774
- What are you doing?
- What is wrong with you?

2550
01:55:55,905 --> 01:55:57,080
- Shh!
- Geez.

2551
01:55:57,211 --> 01:55:58,560
I'm good, I'm good.

2552
01:55:58,690 --> 01:56:00,736
No, no, no. Serious question.

2553
01:56:00,866 --> 01:56:02,390
Why is Toni not here, bro?

2554
01:56:02,520 --> 01:56:03,782
Yo, her mom grounded her.

2555
01:56:03,913 --> 01:56:05,959
Yo, she's such
a bitch. What the fuck?

2556
01:56:07,221 --> 01:56:08,301
Guys, I really hurt myself.

2557
01:56:09,571 --> 01:56:11,399
- Shit.
- Why did you trip?

2558
01:56:11,529 --> 01:56:12,835
What the fuck.

2559
01:56:25,891 --> 01:56:27,328
Nothing bad's gonna happen.

2560
01:56:36,772 --> 01:56:37,967
Are you gonna tell 'em
just like you told me?

2561
01:56:37,991 --> 01:56:40,384
I guess I have to.

2562
01:56:40,515 --> 01:56:41,515
I'm proud of you.

2563
01:57:18,466 --> 01:57:20,076
Hey. Hey.

2564
01:57:23,558 --> 01:57:24,558
Mind if I...

2565
01:57:25,255 --> 01:57:26,255
Please, come join me.

2566
01:57:43,969 --> 01:57:45,058
You're leaving?

2567
01:57:46,450 --> 01:57:47,450
Yeah.

2568
01:57:49,018 --> 01:57:50,063
You're lucky.

2569
01:57:52,543 --> 01:57:53,543
Why do you say that?

2570
01:57:54,937 --> 01:57:56,939
I'd like to leave sometimes.

2571
01:57:57,070 --> 01:57:58,230
Well, you can. Why don't you?

2572
01:58:01,726 --> 01:58:02,814
It's not that easy.

2573
01:58:04,860 --> 01:58:06,122
Well, nothing's that easy.

2574
01:58:14,087 --> 01:58:15,479
I wouldn't go back to that.

2575
01:58:15,610 --> 01:58:16,610
What?

2576
01:58:18,439 --> 01:58:20,136
To being a teenager again.

2577
01:58:23,226 --> 01:58:25,837
How were,
how were you as a teenager?

2578
01:58:25,968 --> 01:58:27,230
Being a teenager was hell.

2579
01:58:30,451 --> 01:58:31,451
What?

2580
01:58:33,628 --> 01:58:34,628
Why?

2581
01:58:36,674 --> 01:58:38,554
I don't know, nothing
fell into place, you know.

2582
01:58:39,764 --> 01:58:40,764
What were you like?

2583
01:58:43,420 --> 01:58:46,119
Awkward, stupid.

2584
01:58:47,859 --> 01:58:48,859
Lost.

2585
01:58:58,043 --> 01:58:59,043
Are you gay?

2586
01:59:01,569 --> 01:59:04,528
I mean, I'm whatever
I want to be I guess.

2587
01:59:15,496 --> 01:59:17,256
You want some of this?
There's a little left.

2588
01:59:18,412 --> 01:59:19,412
I...

2589
01:59:20,631 --> 01:59:21,632
Uh...

2590
01:59:39,563 --> 01:59:40,564
Mrs. Fairchild?

2591
01:59:40,695 --> 01:59:41,855
Yes, yes, I'm Mrs. Fairchild.

2592
01:59:41,913 --> 01:59:43,793
Have you found my husband?
Have you located him?

2593
01:59:43,872 --> 01:59:46,004
He called me, and I was
there, I was there with Matty,

2594
01:59:46,135 --> 01:59:47,789
and he was supposed
to come to meet me,

2595
01:59:47,919 --> 01:59:49,269
but he said that he had to...

2596
01:59:49,399 --> 01:59:50,052
Hello.

2597
01:59:50,183 --> 01:59:51,967
You can see me?

2598
01:59:52,097 --> 01:59:53,097
Of course I can see you.

2599
01:59:53,142 --> 01:59:54,404
What do you mean?

2600
01:59:54,535 --> 01:59:55,623
Because nobody else can.

2601
01:59:57,581 --> 01:59:58,581
See?

2602
02:00:01,150 --> 02:00:03,021
- Who are you?
- I'm Matty.

2603
02:00:03,152 --> 02:00:04,414
I'm Nicky. Hi.

2604
02:00:06,111 --> 02:00:09,332
Are you... a ghost?

2605
02:00:10,768 --> 02:00:12,553
I hope not.

2606
02:00:12,683 --> 02:00:13,878
- I thought maybe there was...
- He was gonna take care

2607
02:00:13,902 --> 02:00:14,642
- of things?
- He was gonna take care

2608
02:00:14,772 --> 02:00:16,513
of things, um,

2609
02:00:16,644 --> 02:00:18,044
- he said that he was...
- Let's go!

2610
02:00:18,167 --> 02:00:19,623
- He sounded angry.
- Okay, we need to go.

2611
02:00:19,647 --> 02:00:21,039
Do you think
that he's looking...

2612
02:00:21,170 --> 02:00:22,170
Thank you, Toni.

2613
02:00:22,215 --> 02:00:23,477
Please just wait here, okay?

2614
02:00:23,607 --> 02:00:25,411
- I need to come with you.
- I need you to wait here.

2615
02:00:25,435 --> 02:00:26,435
- Sir.
- Come on!

2616
02:00:26,480 --> 02:00:27,742
- John!
- Please, wait.

2617
02:00:27,872 --> 02:00:29,312
- You want me to stay here?
- Please.

2618
02:00:31,615 --> 02:00:32,877
Hello, hello, excuse me?

2619
02:00:35,010 --> 02:00:37,055
Hello, is anyone here?

2620
02:00:37,186 --> 02:00:38,546
I don't want
to be alone right now,

2621
02:00:38,622 --> 02:00:40,798
so it's good that
we're all together.

2622
02:00:41,886 --> 02:00:43,279
It was after school Monday.

2623
02:00:45,150 --> 02:00:46,630
Amy, we're in a meeting here.

2624
02:00:46,761 --> 02:00:47,936
What's going on? Dad?

2625
02:00:48,066 --> 02:00:49,198
Who are you? Who are they?

2626
02:00:49,329 --> 02:00:51,244
- What are you doing here?
- Who are you?

2627
02:00:51,374 --> 02:00:52,786
- You are the principal?
- Yes, I am the principal!

2628
02:00:52,810 --> 02:00:54,247
Who are you?

2629
02:00:54,377 --> 02:00:56,497
My name is Nikos Kazantzoglou,
and I want to report...

2630
02:01:01,950 --> 02:01:03,212
Where's the teacher?

2631
02:01:03,343 --> 02:01:05,519
If she did do it,
why wasn't she told

2632
02:01:05,649 --> 02:01:07,956
to give all
of the students goggles?

2633
02:01:08,086 --> 02:01:10,915
Why the hell doesn't
the school even own goggles?

2634
02:01:11,046 --> 02:01:13,135
And if we don't have
goggles here,

2635
02:01:13,266 --> 02:01:15,572
why don't the parents know

2636
02:01:15,703 --> 02:01:18,314
so that we can supply
the fucking goggles!

2637
02:01:19,750 --> 02:01:20,750
Where's the teacher?

2638
02:01:21,709 --> 02:01:22,709
Where's the teacher?

2639
02:01:24,102 --> 02:01:25,102
Where's the teacher?

2640
02:01:25,190 --> 02:01:26,540
Where's the teacher?

2641
02:01:26,670 --> 02:01:27,670
Where's the teacher?

2642
02:01:27,758 --> 02:01:30,239
Mr. Fairchild.

2643
02:01:30,370 --> 02:01:32,154
- Where's the teacher?
- Mr. Fairchild.

2644
02:01:32,285 --> 02:01:34,548
- Where's the teacher?
- Look, look, she's not here.

2645
02:01:34,678 --> 02:01:36,680
This is my favorite part
of the movie right here.

2646
02:01:36,811 --> 02:01:37,986
Where's the fucking teacher?

2647
02:01:38,116 --> 02:01:39,572
All right, I know
you're looking for Miss Dhawan.

2648
02:01:39,596 --> 02:01:40,945
She's not here.

2649
02:01:41,076 --> 02:01:43,252
Look, I can call her.
You want me to call her?

2650
02:01:43,383 --> 02:01:44,751
- Call her.
- All right, I'm calling her.

2651
02:01:44,775 --> 02:01:46,255
- Principal Williamson...
- Yeah.

2652
02:01:46,386 --> 02:01:48,170
Has been delayed.
You can imagine

2653
02:01:48,301 --> 02:01:50,781
that he's probably speaking
to who God knows who,

2654
02:01:50,912 --> 02:01:52,740
and so he's coming,
he's on his way.

2655
02:01:52,870 --> 02:01:54,110
- Do we have a timeline?
- Uh...

2656
02:01:54,176 --> 02:01:55,569
- He did not do anything.
- Amy!

2657
02:01:55,699 --> 02:01:57,527
Shut up. Shut the fuck up!
Shut the fuck up!

2658
02:01:57,658 --> 02:01:59,573
- Oh, my God.
- Put the phone away!

2659
02:01:59,703 --> 02:02:01,139
Put the phone down, put it away!

2660
02:02:01,270 --> 02:02:02,378
- I'm putting it away.
- Everybody!

2661
02:02:02,402 --> 02:02:04,578
- Dad, stop!
- Where is she?

2662
02:02:04,708 --> 02:02:07,537
I am representing
thousands of parents.

2663
02:02:07,668 --> 02:02:09,147
- Duly noted...
- Don't...

2664
02:02:09,278 --> 02:02:10,758
- smirk at me.
- What?

2665
02:02:10,888 --> 02:02:13,238
You just gave me a little look.

2666
02:02:13,369 --> 02:02:14,414
Just let my daughter go.

2667
02:02:14,544 --> 02:02:16,000
Let my daughter get
out of here please?

2668
02:02:16,024 --> 02:02:17,634
There's a child here!

2669
02:02:17,765 --> 02:02:19,767
- Shut up!
- Amy...

2670
02:02:19,897 --> 02:02:21,697
Just let her get out.
Let her get out of here!

2671
02:02:23,684 --> 02:02:25,163
- Are you a father?
- Am I a father?

2672
02:02:25,294 --> 02:02:26,948
- Yes.
- Yeah, I'm a father!

2673
02:02:27,078 --> 02:02:28,645
Think, Ross. Think.

2674
02:02:28,776 --> 02:02:31,126
'Cause this time is not
an accident, is it?

2675
02:02:31,256 --> 02:02:32,364
You think there's
gonna be an accident

2676
02:02:32,388 --> 02:02:33,496
like the one that killed my kid!

2677
02:02:33,520 --> 02:02:34,869
This won't be an accident, Ross!

2678
02:02:34,999 --> 02:02:36,827
Matty died?

2679
02:02:36,958 --> 02:02:37,959
He might as well be dead!

2680
02:02:41,963 --> 02:02:43,283
Let's talk about it.
Let's talk...

2681
02:02:43,356 --> 02:02:45,270
This is a big misunderstanding.

2682
02:02:45,401 --> 02:02:46,489
Let my kid out of here.

2683
02:02:46,620 --> 02:02:48,099
- Let the girl go.
- Let her go!

2684
02:02:48,230 --> 02:02:49,971
Just everybody sit down
and let me think!

2685
02:02:50,101 --> 02:02:50,972
Please sit down
and let me think!

2686
02:02:51,102 --> 02:02:52,102
Everybody just sit down.

2687
02:02:52,190 --> 02:02:53,270
- Just sit down!
- Sit down.

2688
02:02:53,322 --> 02:02:54,410
Just do what he says!

2689
02:02:56,717 --> 02:02:58,109
You, uh...

2690
02:02:58,240 --> 02:02:59,440
You and you, you two, get out.

2691
02:02:59,546 --> 02:03:00,546
Okay.

2692
02:03:01,852 --> 02:03:04,942
- Okay. Let's go.
- Go, go, go, go.

2693
02:03:05,073 --> 02:03:06,727
Okay, come on, come on.

2694
02:03:06,857 --> 02:03:09,338
No, no, no, no, no!

2695
02:03:09,469 --> 02:03:11,340
Sit down. No!
Everybody, sit down!

2696
02:03:11,471 --> 02:03:12,752
I told you,
he didn't do anything.

2697
02:03:12,776 --> 02:03:14,212
I don't even know
why you're here.

2698
02:03:14,343 --> 02:03:15,823
I'm sorry. Sit down.

2699
02:03:15,953 --> 02:03:17,694
- Put the gun down!
- No, no, no!

2700
02:03:17,825 --> 02:03:19,280
- Put it down! Put it down!
- Put the gun down.

2701
02:03:19,304 --> 02:03:21,089
I did it.

2702
02:03:21,219 --> 02:03:22,656
- That's not what we...
- Yeah.

2703
02:03:22,786 --> 02:03:24,266
That's not what
we were talking about.

2704
02:03:26,181 --> 02:03:27,269
Put the gun down!

2705
02:03:27,400 --> 02:03:28,923
I need you to put the gun down.

2706
02:03:29,053 --> 02:03:30,185
Okay, where is Jess?

2707
02:03:30,315 --> 02:03:31,839
No, she is
accepting responsibility.

2708
02:03:31,969 --> 02:03:34,058
A statement like that
isn't helping anything.

2709
02:03:34,189 --> 02:03:35,408
Just shut up!

2710
02:03:35,538 --> 02:03:37,081
No one's going anywhere
until I get some answers.

2711
02:03:37,105 --> 02:03:37,932
I know more information now.

2712
02:03:38,062 --> 02:03:38,933
Do you wanna hear it?

2713
02:03:39,063 --> 02:03:40,543
Where's the teacher?

2714
02:03:40,674 --> 02:03:42,763
Look, Ross, there's
some things you don't know.

2715
02:03:42,893 --> 02:03:43,981
It was my fault.

2716
02:03:44,112 --> 02:03:45,722
The children were under my care.

2717
02:03:45,853 --> 02:03:47,047
- Okay, I assume...
- Where's the teacher?

2718
02:03:47,071 --> 02:03:48,769
The one that killed my son!

2719
02:03:48,899 --> 02:03:50,118
She's not here.

2720
02:03:50,248 --> 02:03:51,815
Put it down!

2721
02:03:51,946 --> 02:03:53,426
- No, no, no!
- Put the gun down!

2722
02:03:55,471 --> 02:03:56,864
Put the gun down.
Put the gun down!

2723
02:03:56,994 --> 02:03:58,256
Put that gun down!

2724
02:04:04,872 --> 02:04:05,872
Oh, my God.

2725
02:04:14,795 --> 02:04:15,795
And I died.

2726
02:04:25,545 --> 02:04:26,807
I shan't get on board either.

2727
02:04:26,937 --> 02:04:28,243
Why do you have a gun?

2728
02:04:28,373 --> 02:04:29,200
I think people change.

2729
02:04:29,331 --> 02:04:30,201
Is there a fucking script?

2730
02:04:30,332 --> 02:04:31,376
Why the hell me.

2731
02:04:31,507 --> 02:04:33,727
Day became a good day.

2732
02:04:33,857 --> 02:04:35,057
Will you just put the gun away.

2733
02:04:35,163 --> 02:04:36,947
In his world,
fire does not exist.

2734
02:04:37,078 --> 02:04:38,359
Matty's the best
fucking thing in my life!

2735
02:04:38,383 --> 02:04:39,254
Everybody makes a choice.

2736
02:04:39,384 --> 02:04:40,690
He wants to save the world.

2737
02:04:40,821 --> 02:04:41,821
I can change it.

2738
02:04:41,909 --> 02:04:43,669
The world we see is just
a movie in our mind.

2739
02:04:48,306 --> 02:04:49,569
John never fell asleep.

2740
02:04:53,834 --> 02:04:55,488
It was my dad
who fell asleep in the lab.

2741
02:04:59,796 --> 02:05:00,796
John never lost his gun.

2742
02:05:08,936 --> 02:05:10,241
David never met Nicky.

2743
02:05:16,857 --> 02:05:18,017
Nicky never found the school.

2744
02:05:39,488 --> 02:05:40,533
As for my friends...

2745
02:05:49,498 --> 02:05:50,673
they did the play without me.

2746
02:05:58,289 --> 02:05:59,290
They left a void for me.

2747
02:06:25,839 --> 02:06:26,839
Nobody knew I was there.

2748
02:06:33,542 --> 02:06:35,196
Except perhaps for Toni.

2749
02:07:10,318 --> 02:07:11,319
I kissed her.

2750
02:07:14,496 --> 02:07:15,671
I kissed Toni...

2751
02:07:24,114 --> 02:07:25,114
and she smiled.

2752
02:07:30,338 --> 02:07:31,774
So I came back to life...

2753
02:07:39,564 --> 02:07:41,697
