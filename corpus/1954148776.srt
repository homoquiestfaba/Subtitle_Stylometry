00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:10,200
FIXES & RESYNC BY <b>LUIS-SUBS</b>

2
00:00:19,084 --> 00:00:22,052
In the fifth century,
a group of nomadic warriors

3
00:00:22,054 --> 00:00:25,523
ruled and ravaged the
European continent.

4
00:00:25,525 --> 00:00:28,426
The Huns, as they were called,

5
00:00:28,428 --> 00:00:32,496
were led by a man named Attila.

6
00:00:38,537 --> 00:00:40,771
Attila's personal Hun army

7
00:00:40,773 --> 00:00:43,241
rarely needed weaponry in battle.

8
00:00:44,243 --> 00:00:47,679
They were the weapons.

9
00:01:28,987 --> 00:01:32,223
Their strength and agility
were legendary,

10
00:01:32,225 --> 00:01:37,262
and their enemies were no match
for the Huns sheer brute force.

11
00:01:40,765 --> 00:01:44,168
Thus, every battle was a victory.

12
00:01:53,245 --> 00:01:56,080
Sumatra Sulawesi was
one of Attila's sons

13
00:01:56,082 --> 00:01:59,783
and his most skilled
and talented assassin.

14
00:01:59,785 --> 00:02:04,255
He protected his brother Batel
when he was in trouble.

15
00:02:04,623 --> 00:02:08,826
And when a battle was all but
lost or the loss of men imminent,

16
00:02:08,828 --> 00:02:13,163
Sumatra quickly evened the odds.

17
00:02:30,048 --> 00:02:33,217
While Attila's power and
riches were endless,

18
00:02:33,219 --> 00:02:39,089
his ultimate prize was to
possess the staff of Moses.

19
00:02:43,795 --> 00:02:49,900
Prophecies foretold of the
staff's power to raise the dead.

20
00:02:49,902 --> 00:02:53,170
Other myths promised
incredible riches,

21
00:02:53,172 --> 00:02:55,606
invincibility and immortality

22
00:02:55,608 --> 00:02:59,977
for anyone who wielded the staff.

23
00:03:31,843 --> 00:03:36,747
A ritual was performed to
bestow upon his warrior sons

24
00:03:36,749 --> 00:03:40,551
the dark power of the staff.

25
00:04:29,968 --> 00:04:34,371
Then the glorious staff
was broken...

26
00:04:36,074 --> 00:04:39,043
into three pieces.

27
00:04:51,923 --> 00:04:53,991
To ensure its power
was kept hidden,

28
00:04:53,993 --> 00:04:58,128
Attila scattered the staff's
pieces across the globe.

29
00:04:58,130 --> 00:05:01,198
The map and instructions
on locating them

30
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:03,767
were safely protected and guarded

31
00:05:03,769 --> 00:05:07,371
by his Huns forever.

32
00:05:39,938 --> 00:05:43,507
Keep your eyes open.
Yes, Captain.

33
00:05:43,842 --> 00:05:45,275
Captain, if you were
in heavy battle

34
00:05:45,277 --> 00:05:49,313
and you knew you were going
to have your dick shot off

35
00:05:49,315 --> 00:05:53,851
or lose your arm, which will you choose?
I'd keep my arms.

36
00:05:53,853 --> 00:05:57,821
You can't fight the
enemy with your dick.

37
00:05:59,023 --> 00:06:02,860
Although I'd hate to
have my dick shot off.

38
00:06:13,204 --> 00:06:14,171
I found it.

39
00:06:14,173 --> 00:06:16,974
I found it.
It's right here.

40
00:06:18,977 --> 00:06:22,212
Not even close.

41
00:06:23,114 --> 00:06:24,782
It's upside down.

42
00:06:24,784 --> 00:06:29,019
No wonder they kicked you
out of the Foreign Legion.

43
00:06:42,934 --> 00:06:44,968
That's it.

44
00:06:57,182 --> 00:07:00,384
All right, guys, let's do this.

45
00:07:06,090 --> 00:07:09,092
That's a warning.
Warning, my ass.

46
00:07:09,094 --> 00:07:10,928
Whoa!

47
00:07:13,598 --> 00:07:15,933
Watch yourself.

48
00:08:16,261 --> 00:08:18,896
You know what it says?

49
00:08:18,898 --> 00:08:22,499
What?
"Get the fuck out of here."

50
00:08:23,635 --> 00:08:28,038
No, I think it says,
"Sleep is an illusion.

51
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:31,375
Death is a dream,"
something like that.

52
00:08:31,377 --> 00:08:32,409
Scavenger found.

53
00:08:32,411 --> 00:08:35,479
Need hardware for containment.

54
00:08:36,948 --> 00:08:39,349
Send in the birds.

55
00:08:50,228 --> 00:08:54,398
Private, make sure
that crate's secure.

56
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:56,266
Pilot, send a rope down.

57
00:08:56,268 --> 00:08:58,635
We need to get the rest of my men.

58
00:09:13,451 --> 00:09:16,553
Where you going, pilot?
My team's down there.

59
00:09:19,257 --> 00:09:22,426
Another bird is on the way.
Orders are to protect the package.

60
00:09:22,428 --> 00:09:23,193
Negative.

61
00:09:23,195 --> 00:09:25,729
We're not leaving without them.

62
00:09:31,636 --> 00:09:34,438
You land this thing,
and pick 'em up.

63
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:39,109
Captain, I have orders, and so do you.
Golden team, send other bird

64
00:09:39,111 --> 00:09:42,212
to pick up scavenger's
other pieces.

65
00:09:42,613 --> 00:09:44,614
They'll be fine.

66
00:09:54,559 --> 00:09:58,528
Oh, so you're back for us.
Okay, let's get out of here.

67
00:09:58,530 --> 00:10:02,566
You're two very brave soldiers.

68
00:10:02,568 --> 00:10:04,735
You served your country well.

69
00:10:04,737 --> 00:10:08,171
It's never a good thing
to know too much.

70
00:10:08,173 --> 00:10:11,108
But incidentally, Ms. Nicks,

71
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:14,611
it's, "Sleep is a doorway.

72
00:10:14,613 --> 00:10:17,114
Death is a dream."

73
00:10:17,116 --> 00:10:21,218
Close, very close.

74
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:24,554
But what does that have
to do with anything?

75
00:10:24,556 --> 00:10:29,126
You two ask way too many questions.
I thought you were coming back for us.

76
00:10:29,128 --> 00:10:33,797
No. We are the cleanup crew.

77
00:10:33,799 --> 00:10:35,632
Meat.

78
00:10:59,757 --> 00:11:02,225
Nicks, Yorn, copy.

79
00:11:02,227 --> 00:11:04,694
Yorn, Nicks, copy.

80
00:11:05,763 --> 00:11:08,065
Yorn, copy.

81
00:11:14,639 --> 00:11:18,375
Captain, help me.
Turn around.

82
00:11:21,779 --> 00:11:24,381
Turn around!
That's a fucking order!

83
00:11:24,383 --> 00:11:27,184
Sorry, Captain.
Their bird was shot down.

84
00:11:27,186 --> 00:11:30,320
They didn't make it out alive.

85
00:12:45,897 --> 00:12:50,300
Well, Captain, I understand that,
uh, congratulations are in order.

86
00:12:50,302 --> 00:12:51,801
By God, you want something done,

87
00:12:51,803 --> 00:12:55,338
you send in the best, huh?
Ha ha!

88
00:12:55,473 --> 00:12:58,642
Think the best would have
gotten the men home alive, sir.

89
00:12:58,644 --> 00:13:01,811
Yeah, I heard about that.
I'm very sorry.

90
00:13:01,813 --> 00:13:05,916
Have the families been notified yet?
Uh, not that I'm aware of, no.

91
00:13:05,918 --> 00:13:07,584
I'd like to do that.

92
00:13:07,586 --> 00:13:11,321
Gladly.
All right, sure.

93
00:13:57,535 --> 00:13:59,369
What the hell is that?

94
00:13:59,371 --> 00:14:04,374
Something that was fused
to it a long time ago.

95
00:14:05,843 --> 00:14:07,410
Pry it off.

96
00:14:07,412 --> 00:14:11,314
Actually, we may want
to be more careful.

97
00:14:11,316 --> 00:14:12,749
This is an exceptional find.

98
00:14:12,751 --> 00:14:16,286
We... We could learn a lot from it.

99
00:14:16,288 --> 00:14:17,721
Stop wasting my time.

100
00:14:17,723 --> 00:14:18,588
But, General,

101
00:14:18,590 --> 00:14:22,059
this is the remain of a Nomad...

102
00:14:22,493 --> 00:14:25,862
a warrior from the days
of Attila the Hun.

103
00:14:25,864 --> 00:14:28,832
You see, they altered their bodies

104
00:14:28,834 --> 00:14:30,533
to become ultimate weapons.

105
00:14:30,535 --> 00:14:33,737
They were great protectors
and fierce warriors.

106
00:14:33,739 --> 00:14:37,774
This is a rare find, indeed.

107
00:14:37,776 --> 00:14:40,043
Professor, I don't give a shit

108
00:14:40,045 --> 00:14:42,312
what it is or where it's been.

109
00:14:42,314 --> 00:14:46,916
Now, you can pry it off, you can fry
it off, or you can fuck it off.

110
00:14:46,918 --> 00:14:50,887
Okay? I don't care.
Just clean it up, and do it quickly,

111
00:14:50,889 --> 00:14:55,625
and when you're done, you and the good
doctor here can play with it all you want.

112
00:14:55,627 --> 00:14:57,027
Gladly.

113
00:14:58,929 --> 00:15:01,631
A-Affirmative.
Good.

114
00:15:01,633 --> 00:15:05,001
Scholars and scientists,
disgraced archeologist.

115
00:15:05,003 --> 00:15:08,905
When are you going to learn that the
military's job is profit and war,

116
00:15:08,907 --> 00:15:12,509
and science, that's
somebody else's luxury.

117
00:15:12,511 --> 00:15:14,344
Get out of the way.

118
00:15:18,582 --> 00:15:22,519
Does he really think you'd fuck it?

119
00:15:23,521 --> 00:15:27,691
Come on.
Even I have my standards.

120
00:15:28,392 --> 00:15:33,196
So, um, what do you
want me to do with it?

121
00:15:33,398 --> 00:15:36,733
Do you want me to dispose of it?
No.

122
00:15:36,735 --> 00:15:40,603
You don't pry, fry, or fuck

123
00:15:40,605 --> 00:15:44,040
an archeological find like this.

124
00:15:47,678 --> 00:15:49,879
Do your best not to damage it.

125
00:15:49,881 --> 00:15:52,015
The General knows the deal.

126
00:15:52,017 --> 00:15:55,518
He gets my expertise in his
little treasure hunts,

127
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:58,922
his personal crusades, and
we get full military support

128
00:15:58,924 --> 00:16:02,092
on my archeological digs.

129
00:16:02,727 --> 00:16:05,829
It's up to us to preserve
and learn from the past.

130
00:16:05,831 --> 00:16:09,899
The General is not
interested in that.

131
00:16:14,538 --> 00:16:17,941
History will thank us.

132
00:16:30,521 --> 00:16:32,889
The bombing commenced
several days ago,

133
00:16:32,891 --> 00:16:35,458
and the rebel forces
have dispersed.

134
00:16:35,460 --> 00:16:39,729
However, there is still no trace
of Urianian dictator Alsa Gahan,

135
00:16:39,731 --> 00:16:42,966
who is said to have gone
into hiding six weeks ago,

136
00:16:42,968 --> 00:16:45,502
when the U.S. military
first took action here.

137
00:16:45,504 --> 00:16:48,405
Alsa Gahan is said to
have been responsible

138
00:16:48,407 --> 00:16:51,608
for the deaths of over 163 people.

139
00:16:51,610 --> 00:16:55,812
This is Anna Falcon for BNN News.

140
00:16:56,814 --> 00:16:58,181
Well, well, well.

141
00:16:58,183 --> 00:17:01,050
Overall, I would have to say

142
00:17:01,052 --> 00:17:05,021
that was a resounding success.

143
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:11,928
Except we didn't catch the bad guy,

144
00:17:11,930 --> 00:17:15,131
and I lost two of my best soldiers.

145
00:17:15,834 --> 00:17:19,469
You did your job,
and you did it well.

146
00:17:19,471 --> 00:17:21,137
What was my job?

147
00:17:21,872 --> 00:17:24,741
I've done so many
of these expeditions,

148
00:17:24,743 --> 00:17:27,844
I've lost track of their purpose.

149
00:17:28,846 --> 00:17:31,648
Are you questioning me?
No, sir.

150
00:17:31,650 --> 00:17:34,184
I just find it ironic that
I've lost more men doing this

151
00:17:34,186 --> 00:17:36,719
than I have on the battlefield.

152
00:17:36,721 --> 00:17:41,991
Every decision carries with
it a great deal of risk,

153
00:17:41,993 --> 00:17:44,060
casualties of war.
This isn't war, sir.

154
00:17:44,062 --> 00:17:47,630
We're creating chaos where
there should be none.

155
00:17:47,632 --> 00:17:49,599
I am disappointed, Captain.

156
00:17:49,601 --> 00:17:52,202
You are not seeing
the big picture here.

157
00:17:52,204 --> 00:17:56,072
You have found what could be the
missing piece of the puzzle

158
00:17:56,074 --> 00:17:58,174
that is going to give us victory

159
00:17:58,176 --> 00:18:02,078
of becoming the only
dominant global power.

160
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:02,979
Any leads on Gahan?

161
00:18:02,981 --> 00:18:06,683
Oh, Gahan?
He's in a rathole somewhere.

162
00:18:06,951 --> 00:18:09,519
Don't worry.
We'll find that little bastard

163
00:18:09,521 --> 00:18:13,156
if we have to bomb every terrorist
shit-hole across the world.

164
00:18:13,158 --> 00:18:15,058
And what then?

165
00:18:15,192 --> 00:18:19,829
We blame him for the problems we
create, and we go home like heroes.

166
00:18:19,831 --> 00:18:21,698
I didn't sign up for that.

167
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:25,735
I give the orders, and you obey!

168
00:18:25,737 --> 00:18:30,073
That's why I'm requesting
a transfer, sir.

169
00:18:32,142 --> 00:18:35,645
I've completed your missions.
I'm done.

170
00:18:35,647 --> 00:18:37,881
Your request is denied.

171
00:18:37,883 --> 00:18:41,885
Why?
I need a delivery.

172
00:18:43,621 --> 00:18:46,122
And then?

173
00:18:46,757 --> 00:18:51,261
And then I will consider
giving you your transfer.

174
00:19:18,256 --> 00:19:19,822
Hmm.

175
00:22:18,102 --> 00:22:21,070
Get out!
Get the fuck out!

176
00:22:32,416 --> 00:22:34,851
Now get the fuck out.

177
00:22:36,420 --> 00:22:38,355
Get the fuck out!

178
00:23:20,898 --> 00:23:24,033
This was designed by a craftsman.

179
00:23:24,035 --> 00:23:28,237
There are no visible hinges, and
it's unclear where the opening is,

180
00:23:28,239 --> 00:23:31,641
but there is this space...

181
00:23:33,811 --> 00:23:35,211
for a key.

182
00:23:35,213 --> 00:23:39,048
I had the computer work up
specs on what might open it.

183
00:23:39,050 --> 00:23:42,118
I, uh, crudely
fabricated this, but...

184
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:44,954
Then let's use it.

185
00:23:45,856 --> 00:23:48,324
There was a "but."

186
00:24:08,145 --> 00:24:11,214
That's why you don't touch shit.

187
00:24:11,216 --> 00:24:15,218
To continue, this is a work of art.

188
00:24:15,220 --> 00:24:18,487
With the first key broken off,

189
00:24:18,489 --> 00:24:20,590
the second key should fit in

190
00:24:20,592 --> 00:24:25,027
and unlock the
mechanisms perfectly.

191
00:24:26,563 --> 00:24:29,432
What's wrong?
I'm waiting for a "but."

192
00:24:29,434 --> 00:24:33,402
If you put the key in, that's it.
You want to do the honors?

193
00:24:33,404 --> 00:24:37,006
Oh, I think you've got it covered.

194
00:24:43,413 --> 00:24:45,314
You don't think I'd do this

195
00:24:45,316 --> 00:24:49,185
unless I was absolutely
sure it was, uh...

196
00:24:54,124 --> 00:24:56,926
safe. Heh.

197
00:24:59,096 --> 00:25:01,898
Not funny.
You're still in one piece, aren't you?

198
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:05,301
Well, that's a good
thing for both of us.

199
00:25:24,488 --> 00:25:28,424
That's it?
All that work for a gold-plated stick?

200
00:25:28,426 --> 00:25:31,193
Oh, it's not just any stick.

201
00:25:31,195 --> 00:25:34,964
It happens to be the missing
piece to the staff of Moses.

202
00:25:34,966 --> 00:25:38,501
That staff was destroyed when the
Babylonians tore down Solomon's Temple.

203
00:25:38,503 --> 00:25:42,338
That was the general belief, but myth and
reality are sometimes very separate things.

204
00:25:42,340 --> 00:25:46,208
Wouldn't it have been easier
to find the Holy Grail?

205
00:25:46,210 --> 00:25:49,445
We obtained that
during World War II.

206
00:25:50,982 --> 00:25:53,516
Bring it closer.

207
00:25:58,989 --> 00:26:00,256
Great work.

208
00:26:00,258 --> 00:26:04,026
Let's get this thing into safekeeping.
Fleetwood, prep your men at the Cube.

209
00:26:04,028 --> 00:26:06,262
I've assembled a team
to transport it there.

210
00:26:06,264 --> 00:26:10,466
You two do whatever it is you
do with the rest of the stuff.

211
00:26:11,069 --> 00:26:14,370
I hate it when he does that.

212
00:26:15,973 --> 00:26:21,043
What we have here is the kind of thing that
could shake up the scientific community,

213
00:26:21,045 --> 00:26:23,346
l-let alone theology.

214
00:26:23,348 --> 00:26:26,248
This is divine,

215
00:26:26,250 --> 00:26:28,751
eternal, the mother lode.

216
00:26:28,753 --> 00:26:33,189
And it's for us to protect it,
not to have.

217
00:26:33,191 --> 00:26:37,393
But it could be ours.
Eventually.

218
00:26:37,395 --> 00:26:40,463
I'm sorry, Professor,
but when you have

219
00:26:40,465 --> 00:26:44,467
what shouldn't exist in your
grasp, nothing else matters.

220
00:26:44,469 --> 00:26:47,036
We only have a piece of it.

221
00:26:47,038 --> 00:26:49,672
This is bigger than all of us.

222
00:26:49,674 --> 00:26:53,676
Besides, you realize
the military owns you

223
00:26:53,678 --> 00:26:57,747
now that you have become a
part of their little project.

224
00:26:57,749 --> 00:27:02,184
Nobody owns me. I'm freelance,
and I have the 1099 to prove it.

225
00:27:02,186 --> 00:27:03,419
The General trusts you.

226
00:27:03,421 --> 00:27:07,490
Otherwise, he wouldn't
have told you this much.

227
00:27:07,758 --> 00:27:11,227
What would he do
if he didn't trust me?

228
00:27:11,795 --> 00:27:13,729
Costa Rica.

229
00:27:14,798 --> 00:27:19,301
And it wouldn't be
for a vacation either.

230
00:27:20,437 --> 00:27:22,772
Keep an eye on the doctor.

231
00:27:22,774 --> 00:27:25,207
The plans have changed.

232
00:27:25,209 --> 00:27:27,443
Costa Rica?

233
00:27:27,445 --> 00:27:29,712
Not yet.

234
00:27:30,414 --> 00:27:31,313
Costa Rica.

235
00:27:31,315 --> 00:27:34,784
I can go to Costa Rica if I
want to go to Costa Rica.

236
00:27:34,786 --> 00:27:37,353
Be a vacation.

237
00:29:03,907 --> 00:29:05,875
Whoa!
Whoa!

238
00:29:25,795 --> 00:29:28,264
Stay alert.

239
00:29:30,634 --> 00:29:31,834
Keep your eyes open.

240
00:29:31,836 --> 00:29:35,204
I don't know, boss.

241
00:29:35,672 --> 00:29:39,375
Just be ready.
I don't know about this, boss.

242
00:29:39,377 --> 00:29:42,211
You got the big gun.
Don't worry.

243
00:29:48,351 --> 00:29:51,520
Jonesy, want you to take point.

244
00:30:11,808 --> 00:30:13,809
Whoa.

245
00:30:29,693 --> 00:30:31,460
Stop!

246
00:30:45,842 --> 00:30:48,911
There's a breach in sector 12.
Heavy casualties.

247
00:30:48,913 --> 00:30:49,845
Do we know who did this?

248
00:30:49,847 --> 00:30:52,815
Not yet, General.
We're sending in a separate team now.

249
00:30:52,817 --> 00:30:57,253
All right, make sure that they know
the intruder does not leave the base.

250
00:30:57,255 --> 00:30:58,587
Yes, sir.

251
00:30:58,589 --> 00:31:00,956
And bring me Vito!

252
00:31:09,332 --> 00:31:11,400
Stand back there, buddy.

253
00:31:12,702 --> 00:31:13,669
Captain.

254
00:31:22,580 --> 00:31:24,046
What the fuck?!

255
00:31:24,048 --> 00:31:26,815
Apparently he doesn't
like visitors.

256
00:31:26,817 --> 00:31:31,287
Then why don't we leave him alone?
Because he gets results.

257
00:31:38,562 --> 00:31:41,664
He's out of bullets.
Let's go.

258
00:31:44,801 --> 00:31:48,437
The General needs to see you.
It's urgent.

259
00:31:48,439 --> 00:31:52,441
Get the fuck out of here!

260
00:31:53,443 --> 00:31:54,443
Now!

261
00:31:54,445 --> 00:31:59,782
We need to take you
to the General now.

262
00:32:16,666 --> 00:32:18,834
You're not real.

263
00:32:26,376 --> 00:32:28,777
Time to go.

264
00:32:44,694 --> 00:32:47,830
On your feet, soldier.

265
00:32:48,798 --> 00:32:50,699
Yes, Professor.

266
00:32:52,435 --> 00:32:55,804
Professor, listen.
Eh, get ahold of yourself.

267
00:32:55,806 --> 00:32:57,573
Okay.

268
00:32:57,575 --> 00:32:59,942
All right.

269
00:32:59,944 --> 00:33:01,777
Uh, look...

270
00:33:07,617 --> 00:33:09,918
Poor baby.

271
00:33:14,991 --> 00:33:17,793
Now what happened?

272
00:33:17,795 --> 00:33:19,128
I...

273
00:33:22,932 --> 00:33:25,567
There was... I...

274
00:33:27,003 --> 00:33:30,472
It was a monster.
A monster?

275
00:33:30,474 --> 00:33:31,874
Professor, listen, I tried...

276
00:33:31,876 --> 00:33:34,810
Okay, calm down.

277
00:33:44,521 --> 00:33:48,157
You can tell me all about it later.

278
00:34:33,070 --> 00:34:35,037
Everyone's dead,

279
00:34:35,039 --> 00:34:37,539
including Buckingham.

280
00:34:37,541 --> 00:34:39,074
So give me the bad news.

281
00:34:39,076 --> 00:34:41,910
The Project Genesis
has been compromised.

282
00:34:41,912 --> 00:34:46,482
The staff and the Nomad were taken.

283
00:34:46,484 --> 00:34:50,686
If we had a breach, it had to come
from the doctor's side or yours.

284
00:34:50,688 --> 00:34:53,856
My men wouldn't cross me.
Give the order.

285
00:34:53,858 --> 00:34:55,924
The intruder is still
in the building.

286
00:34:55,926 --> 00:34:59,094
Make sure that everyone,
including your boy,

287
00:34:59,096 --> 00:35:01,630
don't let it escape.

288
00:35:03,501 --> 00:35:05,267
So, Meat...

289
00:35:06,703 --> 00:35:10,873
tell me about this monster.

290
00:35:30,226 --> 00:35:32,060
There he is!

291
00:36:11,901 --> 00:36:14,670
Tough luck.
He should be dead.

292
00:36:14,971 --> 00:36:17,339
First team activated!

293
00:36:29,819 --> 00:36:34,656
So you're trying to tell me
this thing came back to life?

294
00:36:34,658 --> 00:36:35,591
Perhaps.

295
00:36:35,593 --> 00:36:40,195
We've been trying to figure out
the staff's secrets for years.

296
00:36:40,197 --> 00:36:44,032
Many men, many hours,

297
00:36:44,034 --> 00:36:47,035
and we just saw its power resurrect

298
00:36:47,037 --> 00:36:50,272
a 1,500-year-old
warrior.

299
00:36:50,274 --> 00:36:53,308
There is your super soldier.

300
00:36:53,643 --> 00:36:56,945
And he just ran off with the key.

301
00:36:56,947 --> 00:37:01,249
Or maybe he is the key.

302
00:37:43,226 --> 00:37:46,294
Thought I had the night off.

303
00:37:46,296 --> 00:37:49,231
You two, dismissed.

304
00:37:54,303 --> 00:37:56,004
It's a great team.

305
00:37:56,006 --> 00:38:00,075
So what have you heard
about the boss man?

306
00:38:00,077 --> 00:38:03,345
Loyal, gets the job done.

307
00:38:03,347 --> 00:38:06,248
Not much else. Yeah,
I heard that, too,

308
00:38:06,250 --> 00:38:10,853
and I also heard he loses his men
about as often as I lose my car keys.

309
00:38:11,055 --> 00:38:14,890
Look, there's eight of us, one of him.
It's a piece of cake.

310
00:38:14,892 --> 00:38:20,095
Look, I'm just saying suicide
bombers have better odds than us.

311
00:38:20,229 --> 00:38:23,465
Yeah, and how often
do you lose your keys?

312
00:38:23,467 --> 00:38:25,767
Few times a week.

313
00:38:25,769 --> 00:38:28,236
And you're our driver.

314
00:38:29,105 --> 00:38:30,872
Your point?

315
00:38:32,141 --> 00:38:35,911
Hey, I'm a fucking great driver!

316
00:38:37,914 --> 00:38:39,414
Shit.

317
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:46,722
What's the mission?

318
00:38:49,392 --> 00:38:52,894
Pick one, any one.

319
00:38:53,029 --> 00:38:54,229
Wait. This is not
one of those tricks

320
00:38:54,231 --> 00:38:57,466
where you try to stab my fingers
for taking a piece, huh?

321
00:38:57,468 --> 00:38:59,868
No. Just hang on to it for later.

322
00:38:59,870 --> 00:39:02,938
All right. Thanks.

323
00:39:07,443 --> 00:39:10,245
Oh, man of few words.
Like it.

324
00:39:10,247 --> 00:39:12,748
A man of no words, actually.

325
00:39:12,750 --> 00:39:15,984
Hasn't said a peep, even
though I know he's not deaf.

326
00:39:15,986 --> 00:39:18,053
I tried telling him
my life story once.

327
00:39:18,055 --> 00:39:21,022
Drove him so crazy,
he paid me to stop.

328
00:39:22,459 --> 00:39:24,392
Let's get it in.

329
00:39:30,833 --> 00:39:33,201
Well, the mission
originally was simple...

330
00:39:33,203 --> 00:39:36,404
transport a package
to these coordinates.

331
00:39:41,978 --> 00:39:43,545
Little Kate McVie.

332
00:39:43,547 --> 00:39:48,049
Heh. I haven't heard that in years.

333
00:39:48,417 --> 00:39:49,551
I served with your father.

334
00:39:49,553 --> 00:39:52,954
He never stopped talking
about his little girl.

335
00:39:57,527 --> 00:39:58,960
Well...

336
00:39:58,962 --> 00:40:02,164
not a little girl anymore, Captain.

337
00:40:02,465 --> 00:40:06,201
He was a good man,
hell of a soldier.

338
00:40:06,203 --> 00:40:07,869
I know.

339
00:40:08,471 --> 00:40:11,339
I wish he was still here.

340
00:40:20,516 --> 00:40:23,885
Glad to see you followed
in his footsteps.

341
00:40:23,887 --> 00:40:26,054
He always had my back.

342
00:40:26,056 --> 00:40:28,423
I'll have yours.

343
00:40:37,433 --> 00:40:41,536
Unfortunately...
plans have changed.

344
00:40:55,518 --> 00:40:58,153
Listen up!

345
00:40:58,988 --> 00:41:02,123
I know most of you are
unproven in battle,

346
00:41:02,125 --> 00:41:05,427
but you've been handpicked because
you're the best at what you do.

347
00:41:05,429 --> 00:41:08,964
The enemy that we're facing
is not an army of terrorists,

348
00:41:08,966 --> 00:41:10,932
but a single assassin

349
00:41:10,934 --> 00:41:14,603
capable of handling anything
that we throw his way.

350
00:41:14,605 --> 00:41:19,140
We know little of his origin,
nationality or affiliation.

351
00:41:19,142 --> 00:41:25,180
Our objective is the
retrieval of this.

352
00:41:30,419 --> 00:41:33,521
It was stolen from our
labs at 0-1200 hours.

353
00:41:33,523 --> 00:41:36,925
It's believed to contain
information encoded on it

354
00:41:36,927 --> 00:41:41,263
to help with the Urianian fight in
Operation "Sandstorm" overseas.

355
00:41:41,265 --> 00:41:45,667
We already sent out a team, and we
lost track of them about an hour ago.

356
00:41:48,504 --> 00:41:52,974
He shoots at things
that aren't there,

357
00:41:52,976 --> 00:41:57,579
and I'm not quite sure
what side he's really on.

358
00:41:58,114 --> 00:42:00,282
He can be trusted.

359
00:42:00,683 --> 00:42:04,452
Are you sure he can handle this?

360
00:42:04,454 --> 00:42:08,924
Send a dead man in to
do a dead man's job.

361
00:42:10,927 --> 00:42:12,027
Helping us on the mission

362
00:42:12,029 --> 00:42:16,264
will be Professor Fleetwood's
assistant, Corporal Anderson.

363
00:42:16,266 --> 00:42:17,399
Meat.

364
00:42:17,401 --> 00:42:19,167
Excuse me?

365
00:42:19,169 --> 00:42:20,535
Just call me Meat.

366
00:42:20,537 --> 00:42:23,672
Corporal Anderson
has been gathering

367
00:42:23,674 --> 00:42:26,574
most of the intel on the assassin.

368
00:42:26,576 --> 00:42:29,444
Any questions?

369
00:42:29,712 --> 00:42:32,113
Where is our target's location, sir?

370
00:42:32,115 --> 00:42:35,283
We believe the target
is 40 kilometers west.

371
00:42:35,285 --> 00:42:37,352
When we find him, get the package,

372
00:42:37,354 --> 00:42:42,424
and deliver it back to the
rendezvous point at Santa Mira.

373
00:42:43,192 --> 00:42:44,459
Bulldog?

374
00:42:44,461 --> 00:42:48,263
Alive or dead, sir?
Either way is acceptable.

375
00:42:48,664 --> 00:42:53,635
Actually, alive would
be much better.

376
00:42:56,539 --> 00:43:00,475
Alive, it is.
Let's rock 'n' roll.

377
00:44:47,149 --> 00:44:51,553
I am picking up the target
on thermal imaging, Captain.

378
00:44:51,555 --> 00:44:54,255
Whoo-ee!
All right!

379
00:44:54,257 --> 00:44:57,525
Heavy activity due west.

380
00:44:58,294 --> 00:45:00,595
Yo, Spence, what's up with the gum?

381
00:45:00,597 --> 00:45:04,165
Found you can tell a lot about a
person by the type of gum they chew.

382
00:45:04,167 --> 00:45:08,169
Like me, I chose Icebreakers, right,
'cause my little game breaks the ice.

383
00:45:08,171 --> 00:45:10,171
I'd have taken you
for a Juicy Fruit.

384
00:45:10,173 --> 00:45:15,176
That's funny, 'cause, uh, actually you're
the one who chose Juicy Fruit, Bulldog.

385
00:45:19,248 --> 00:45:23,118
Yeah, so what's Dentyne mean?
Means you're meticulous.

386
00:45:23,120 --> 00:45:26,488
You like to be ready and
fresh at all times, yeah?

387
00:45:26,490 --> 00:45:27,789
You got him.

388
00:45:27,791 --> 00:45:30,291
And, Mason, you've got Carefree,

389
00:45:30,293 --> 00:45:33,228
so you're a roll-with-the-punches
kind of guy?

390
00:45:33,230 --> 00:45:36,164
Copy that.
McVie chose Chiclets.

391
00:45:36,166 --> 00:45:36,898
'Cause I'm a chick?

392
00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:39,434
Yeah, I don't have anything
else for that, actually.

393
00:45:39,436 --> 00:45:43,471
Nobody ever chooses that. Sorry.
You're kind of the wild card.

394
00:45:43,473 --> 00:45:43,838
Nice.

395
00:45:43,840 --> 00:45:45,874
And Green, my man of no words,

396
00:45:45,876 --> 00:45:49,677
he declined any gum 'cause
he had his own pack.

397
00:45:50,580 --> 00:45:53,815
Anderson, what'd you get again?
I didn't.

398
00:45:53,817 --> 00:45:57,585
Oh, guess 'cause that means
you're better than us.

399
00:45:58,288 --> 00:46:02,724
I didn't need a pack of
gum to tell me that.

400
00:46:03,425 --> 00:46:05,393
What the fuck?

401
00:46:16,305 --> 00:46:18,940
Holy shit!

402
00:46:30,553 --> 00:46:33,421
All right, everyone quiet.

403
00:46:33,556 --> 00:46:36,958
Mason, what do you have
on thermal imaging?

404
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:41,396
Yeah, this motherfucker's fast.
He's circling us, but he's just posturing.

405
00:46:41,398 --> 00:46:45,700
He never gets closer than 30 feet.
There's only one, right?

406
00:46:45,702 --> 00:46:48,336
Check that.
All right.

407
00:46:48,538 --> 00:46:53,709
Burnette, Bulldog and Meat,

408
00:46:54,211 --> 00:46:55,910
you guys stay here.

409
00:46:55,912 --> 00:46:59,781
Everyone else, come with me.

410
00:47:06,589 --> 00:47:08,790
No hotshot bullshit.

411
00:47:08,792 --> 00:47:12,527
You guys fight if you must.
React if engaged.

412
00:47:12,529 --> 00:47:15,296
Fall back if I say so.

413
00:47:16,599 --> 00:47:20,568
Frankly, we'll take this guy in no time.
This isn't some superman shit.

414
00:47:20,570 --> 00:47:22,537
Bullets will not fly
off your chest.

415
00:47:22,539 --> 00:47:25,907
The enemy will eat you up, shit
you out and come back for more.

416
00:47:25,909 --> 00:47:29,410
Follow my lead,
and we'll get out of this.

417
00:47:29,412 --> 00:47:30,878
Yes, sir.

418
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:34,716
Three skulls, three bodies,
no jeep.

419
00:47:34,718 --> 00:47:36,684
Where's the other soldier?

420
00:47:36,686 --> 00:47:39,454
Maybe this asshole got hungry.

421
00:47:49,833 --> 00:47:52,767
Incoming! 6 o'clock!

422
00:47:57,573 --> 00:47:59,474
Cover me.

423
00:48:48,057 --> 00:48:50,024
Fall back!
What about the package, Captain?

424
00:48:50,026 --> 00:48:52,694
Can wait.
Let's move!

425
00:48:55,464 --> 00:48:58,900
Why the fuck didn't you tell us
what we were up against, Meat?

426
00:48:58,902 --> 00:49:01,469
You knew it was a tough opponent.
You saw the tapes.

427
00:49:01,471 --> 00:49:03,771
Yeah, I didn't know bullets
would fly right through him.

428
00:49:03,773 --> 00:49:05,406
We could have used
that information.

429
00:49:05,408 --> 00:49:08,376
You wouldn't have
believed me, anyways.

430
00:49:09,511 --> 00:49:10,945
Heh heh heh.
Okay, all right.

431
00:49:10,947 --> 00:49:13,114
All right, m-maybe you
would have believed me.

432
00:49:13,116 --> 00:49:16,484
What the fuck is that thing,
and how do we stop it?

433
00:49:16,486 --> 00:49:19,887
You should know.
You brought it back with you.

434
00:49:19,889 --> 00:49:22,523
From where?
Operation "Sandstorm."

435
00:49:22,525 --> 00:49:24,759
How?
It's not important anymore, okay?

436
00:49:24,761 --> 00:49:28,896
As for what, it's a nomadic
warrior from ancient times.

437
00:49:28,898 --> 00:49:32,533
You're testing my patience,
you little shit. Truth.

438
00:49:32,535 --> 00:49:34,135
Shouldn't it be dead by now?

439
00:49:34,137 --> 00:49:38,606
I mean, you shot him, and you hurt
him, and he's still coming at us?

440
00:49:38,608 --> 00:49:39,407
Okay, all right.

441
00:49:39,409 --> 00:49:44,512
So why don't you tell us
what the truth is, Captain?

442
00:49:44,514 --> 00:49:48,049
I mean, you are the Captain, right?

443
00:49:48,617 --> 00:49:49,617
How do we stop it?

444
00:49:49,619 --> 00:49:53,488
Uh, Captain, incoming!

445
00:50:01,898 --> 00:50:07,034
Captain, we've got a problem.

446
00:50:08,804 --> 00:50:11,439
Leaky boat.
We're losing fuel fast.

447
00:50:11,441 --> 00:50:14,008
We need to sto...

448
00:50:17,913 --> 00:50:19,080
Okay, what I meant to say

449
00:50:19,082 --> 00:50:22,683
was we're stopped,
and I need to fix it.

450
00:50:22,685 --> 00:50:25,486
Shit.
What about the reserve tank?

451
00:50:25,488 --> 00:50:28,156
It's jammed, boss man.

452
00:50:30,492 --> 00:50:33,594
Hey, we're sitting ducks out here.

453
00:50:34,062 --> 00:50:36,197
Let's go after it.

454
00:50:54,950 --> 00:50:58,686
How bad is it?
Transmission's gone.

455
00:50:58,688 --> 00:51:01,556
Fuel and brake line is cut.

456
00:51:01,558 --> 00:51:04,859
I'd say it's looking pretty
shitty right about now.

457
00:51:04,861 --> 00:51:07,195
Well, can you fix it?
With what? Magic?

458
00:51:07,197 --> 00:51:09,096
I'm all out of tricks, Cap.

459
00:51:09,098 --> 00:51:12,834
You got 20 while we
look for this thing.

460
00:51:12,836 --> 00:51:14,802
Keep an eye on him.
Take it.

461
00:51:14,804 --> 00:51:18,906
Whoa! You leaving me here
with the boy wonder?

462
00:51:18,908 --> 00:51:21,042
He isn't one of us.
As a matter of fact,

463
00:51:21,044 --> 00:51:24,078
I don't even know if he's one of them.
He can't even protect himself.

464
00:51:24,080 --> 00:51:28,216
He can point and shoot, and right now,
we need all the muscle we can spare.

465
00:51:28,218 --> 00:51:31,118
Sorry, Bulldog.
Let's move it out!

466
00:51:37,159 --> 00:51:40,061
You even know how
to use one of those?

467
00:52:00,215 --> 00:52:01,048
Great.

468
00:52:01,050 --> 00:52:03,718
There's not a single
damn person on this team

469
00:52:03,720 --> 00:52:07,855
other than myself who isn't
fucking bat-shit crazy.

470
00:52:14,096 --> 00:52:16,564
Are you gonna let
us in on your plan?

471
00:52:16,566 --> 00:52:19,066
Yeah. We find the package,
and we get the hell out.

472
00:52:19,068 --> 00:52:24,071
We couldn't do it before. What makes
you so sure we can do it now?

473
00:52:25,140 --> 00:52:26,707
We improvise.

474
00:52:27,943 --> 00:52:29,977
We need to call for backup.

475
00:52:29,979 --> 00:52:33,147
We are not equipped to handle
that thing on our own.

476
00:52:33,149 --> 00:52:33,981
We're it, McVie.

477
00:52:33,983 --> 00:52:37,618
If we can't handle it, no one can.

478
00:52:39,756 --> 00:52:43,257
He's due west.
All right, hold.

479
00:52:43,259 --> 00:52:45,259
Mason, Burnette,
Green, to the right.

480
00:52:45,261 --> 00:52:48,663
McVie and Spencer,
you come with me.

481
00:52:59,675 --> 00:53:03,010
Shit.
Radio for help.

482
00:53:11,086 --> 00:53:14,155
Signal's weak.
Piece of shit.

483
00:53:20,128 --> 00:53:21,996
He's coming.

484
00:53:25,334 --> 00:53:26,367
Stand down!

485
00:53:34,176 --> 00:53:36,811
Got a man down!
We found him! We found him!

486
00:53:36,813 --> 00:53:40,114
Hold your position.
We're coming to you.

487
00:54:32,868 --> 00:54:37,138
Where are the others?
Everyone's dead.

488
00:54:37,140 --> 00:54:39,106
That thing's immortal.

489
00:54:40,976 --> 00:54:42,376
Hold your fire!

490
00:54:56,358 --> 00:54:58,793
Fall back!

491
00:55:07,903 --> 00:55:11,338
It's knocking them off one by one.

492
00:55:11,340 --> 00:55:14,008
It's time to head to
our rendezvous point.

493
00:55:14,010 --> 00:55:18,345
Your captain is going to fail.

494
00:55:20,048 --> 00:55:24,218
If there is anything that you've
learned in your time here,

495
00:55:24,220 --> 00:55:26,754
it's to never underestimate him.

496
00:55:26,756 --> 00:55:29,290
He will not fail.

497
00:55:41,036 --> 00:55:45,907
Which him are you referring to?

498
00:55:56,017 --> 00:55:58,018
Bulldog, status?

499
00:55:59,020 --> 00:56:01,222
Negative.

500
00:56:01,890 --> 00:56:04,525
I even used a Band-Aid.

501
00:56:06,261 --> 00:56:09,396
Where are the others?
They didn't make it.

502
00:56:09,398 --> 00:56:12,933
We need to move.
Where's Anderson?

503
00:56:22,944 --> 00:56:27,047
Oh, yeah.
Oh, that's right.

504
00:56:31,921 --> 00:56:35,055
Jesus, man!
Can't a guy take a leak?

505
00:56:35,057 --> 00:56:37,024
You left your post.

506
00:56:38,193 --> 00:56:42,129
I had to take a leak.
I give an order, you follow it.

507
00:56:42,131 --> 00:56:44,331
We lost men today!
Next time we're under attack

508
00:56:44,333 --> 00:56:46,500
and I find you writing love
letters to the Professor

509
00:56:46,502 --> 00:56:51,372
in that stupid fucking book of
yours, I'll toss you out myself.

510
00:56:51,374 --> 00:56:52,973
You understand that?

511
00:56:53,576 --> 00:56:58,245
I don't take orders from you.
My daddy will ruin you.

512
00:56:58,247 --> 00:57:00,548
Oh, yeah? Who's your daddy?
Fleetwood.

513
00:57:00,550 --> 00:57:04,418
Yeah? Well, when you're with us, you're
one of us, you take orders from me.

514
00:57:04,420 --> 00:57:06,220
Is that clear?

515
00:57:07,289 --> 00:57:09,523
Is that clear?
Okay, yes, sir.

516
00:57:09,525 --> 00:57:10,191
Yes, sir.

517
00:57:10,193 --> 00:57:13,260
Get your ass up,
and get to the vehicle.

518
00:58:20,061 --> 00:58:23,163
Captain, are you okay?

519
00:58:27,135 --> 00:58:29,570
Captain, do you see something?

520
00:58:45,153 --> 00:58:46,954
Um...

521
00:58:49,524 --> 00:58:50,991
the Humvee's toast.

522
00:58:50,993 --> 00:58:52,493
Yeah, but...
Let's get the gear.

523
00:58:52,495 --> 00:58:54,295
We'll take the jeep.
Okay.

524
00:58:54,297 --> 00:58:56,163
Let's go.

525
00:59:21,423 --> 00:59:25,192
Why does he keep coming after
us if he has what he wants?

526
00:59:25,194 --> 00:59:26,961
We're still a threat.

527
00:59:47,649 --> 00:59:49,616
Oh, shit!

528
00:59:54,155 --> 00:59:55,689
Fuck!

529
00:59:55,691 --> 00:59:57,725
Bulldog, you dead?

530
00:59:58,760 --> 00:59:59,760
No, sir.

531
00:59:59,762 --> 01:00:02,830
Then ram this motherfucker.

532
01:00:03,232 --> 01:00:05,299
Yes, sir.

533
01:00:23,585 --> 01:00:27,388
Oh, look.
Not so tough now, huh? Huh?

534
01:00:28,357 --> 01:00:31,025
Huh? Motherfucker? Huh?
Meat, cut it out!

535
01:00:31,027 --> 01:00:33,060
Watch this, guys.
Watch this.

536
01:00:37,266 --> 01:00:40,401
Oh, you motherfucker!

537
01:00:49,077 --> 01:00:52,947
Just fucking die!

538
01:00:53,149 --> 01:00:54,581
Mac.

539
01:00:55,316 --> 01:00:58,419
You guys get the fuck out of here.

540
01:00:58,421 --> 01:01:00,187
I got this.

541
01:01:04,459 --> 01:01:06,660
Go! Go!

542
01:01:08,530 --> 01:01:09,663
Go!

543
01:01:09,665 --> 01:01:14,535
Hey, beautiful, want a bang?

544
01:01:27,682 --> 01:01:30,250
That's the rendezvous point.

545
01:01:44,532 --> 01:01:47,768
You okay?
I've been better.

546
01:01:47,770 --> 01:01:49,636
Just give me a second.

547
01:01:49,638 --> 01:01:51,105
Okay.

548
01:01:52,807 --> 01:01:56,343
You know, Captain, I disagree
with what they say about you.

549
01:01:56,345 --> 01:01:58,145
You don't know anything
about my reputation.

550
01:01:58,147 --> 01:02:01,348
Yeah, I do.
It's pretty damn flawless.

551
01:02:01,350 --> 01:02:03,150
You get results, Captain.

552
01:02:03,152 --> 01:02:05,752
We lost men, McVie.
I'm still here.

553
01:02:05,754 --> 01:02:10,390
I just want you to know that I'm proud
to be on your team, and I got your back.

554
01:02:12,361 --> 01:02:13,327
Burnette!

555
01:02:13,329 --> 01:02:18,765
Go! Get out of here!
Finish the mission!

556
01:02:21,302 --> 01:02:23,470
Code red!

557
01:02:27,675 --> 01:02:30,911
Code red!
Stand clear.

558
01:03:21,396 --> 01:03:24,698
Nice fucking shot.
Sir.

559
01:03:32,807 --> 01:03:34,841
Shit!
He's not dead!

560
01:03:34,843 --> 01:03:36,843
Go, go, go, go!

561
01:03:48,790 --> 01:03:51,925
I'm Captain Ernest Vito.
This is Sergeant Kate McVie.

562
01:03:51,927 --> 01:03:54,494
Corporal Thom Sharp.
Corporal Arnold Tazbury.

563
01:03:54,496 --> 01:03:57,764
We have priority clearance, and we
need immediate access to the Cube.

564
01:03:57,766 --> 01:04:00,601
Need you guys to detain the
assassin as long as possible.

565
01:04:00,603 --> 01:04:03,503
I need your clearance code first.
Bravo 5150.

566
01:04:03,505 --> 01:04:05,405
Thank you, Captain.

567
01:04:18,419 --> 01:04:20,754
You're in good hands now.

568
01:04:23,992 --> 01:04:28,462
Captain, we're in a jail cell.
What the hell?

569
01:04:29,831 --> 01:04:31,531
Just wait.

570
01:04:48,383 --> 01:04:50,050
Sounds like he gave up.

571
01:04:53,588 --> 01:04:55,589
Go, go, go, go, go!

572
01:05:17,512 --> 01:05:20,480
Stop right there, motherfucker!

573
01:05:53,047 --> 01:05:53,847
Oh, shit.

574
01:05:53,849 --> 01:05:58,418
You sure you know what you're doing?
Yeah. Let's go.

575
01:06:14,969 --> 01:06:18,605
Stay with me.
Roger that, Captain.

576
01:06:37,091 --> 01:06:39,960
Isn't there a switch?

577
01:06:39,962 --> 01:06:41,027
Oh.

578
01:06:41,029 --> 01:06:44,431
How 'bout that?
That'll work.

579
01:06:48,069 --> 01:06:51,872
Okay, so fill me in.
What is all this?

580
01:06:51,874 --> 01:06:53,473
What was all that upstairs?

581
01:06:53,475 --> 01:06:58,512
This place, Santa Mira, it doesn't
exist, not on the map, not on radar.

582
01:06:58,714 --> 01:07:00,947
So who are all those people?

583
01:07:00,949 --> 01:07:03,817
Military posing as police.

584
01:07:03,819 --> 01:07:07,988
It's a fake front in case
anybody found it by accident.

585
01:07:07,990 --> 01:07:12,526
If the enemy ever invaded,
they wouldn't think twice.

586
01:07:13,528 --> 01:07:17,731
Invasion? Shit.
It was built in the fifties.

587
01:07:17,733 --> 01:07:22,569
The underground has the largest military
fallout shelter ever constructed.

588
01:07:22,771 --> 01:07:25,605
Main compound runs the
entire United States.

589
01:07:25,607 --> 01:07:27,107
President, his military advisers,

590
01:07:27,109 --> 01:07:30,510
they can access it
anytime, anywhere.

591
01:07:30,512 --> 01:07:31,512
I've never heard of this,

592
01:07:31,513 --> 01:07:34,848
and I've heard just about every
military urban legend there is.

593
01:07:34,850 --> 01:07:38,185
Yeah, well, think we were a bit
more paranoid in the fifties,

594
01:07:38,187 --> 01:07:40,821
even though the enemy
threat is much bigger.

595
01:07:40,823 --> 01:07:41,955
So where are we going?

596
01:07:41,957 --> 01:07:44,858
The Cube.
That's the rendezvous point.

597
01:07:44,860 --> 01:07:48,528
It's where we meet the General
if we found Project Genesis.

598
01:07:48,530 --> 01:07:51,731
How does he know to meet us there?
My access code alerted it.

599
01:07:51,733 --> 01:07:55,168
Well, how do we know that
thing ain't still following us?

600
01:07:55,170 --> 01:07:59,072
It is. It just broke through.
It's heading our direction.

601
01:07:59,074 --> 01:08:03,210
Why don't we just give him the stick
back if he wants it so badly?

602
01:08:03,212 --> 01:08:05,145
Negative.
Can't do that.

603
01:08:05,147 --> 01:08:05,679
Why?

604
01:08:05,681 --> 01:08:07,948
Don't you ever break
the rules, Captain?

605
01:08:07,950 --> 01:08:08,982
No, I don't.
Well, I guess

606
01:08:08,984 --> 01:08:11,017
that's what makes us
different, 'cause I do.

607
01:08:11,019 --> 01:08:13,086
You don't expect me
to believe that, do you?

608
01:08:13,088 --> 01:08:16,022
Oh, come on. You said yourself
we lost too many lives tonight.

609
01:08:16,024 --> 01:08:16,957
That's not the mission.

610
01:08:16,959 --> 01:08:19,092
Okay, then so tell me why
is this stick so important.

611
01:08:19,094 --> 01:08:22,128
It's classified.
I'm not even cleared to know that.

612
01:08:22,130 --> 01:08:26,533
You and everybody's classified crap.
Look, I follow orders.

613
01:08:26,535 --> 01:08:29,269
I assume you do, too. Otherwise, you
wouldn't have made it with me this far.

614
01:08:29,271 --> 01:08:30,837
Well, it's one thing
to follow orders.

615
01:08:30,839 --> 01:08:33,974
It's another thing to know the
difference between right and wrong ones.

616
01:08:33,976 --> 01:08:37,511
There is no right and wrong.
You just choose.

617
01:08:37,513 --> 01:08:39,946
History judges your actions.

618
01:08:41,516 --> 01:08:43,817
You sound like my dad.

619
01:08:43,951 --> 01:08:47,020
He taught me everything I know.

620
01:08:47,022 --> 01:08:48,788
Come on.

621
01:08:59,233 --> 01:09:00,700
Captain, hurry up.

622
01:09:00,702 --> 01:09:03,970
Captain Ernest Vito, Bravo 5150.

623
01:09:09,176 --> 01:09:12,679
Captain Ernest Vito, Bravo 5150!

624
01:09:15,583 --> 01:09:17,651
You're not through?

625
01:09:21,556 --> 01:09:24,758
Captain, we don't have much time!
Let's go.

626
01:09:44,111 --> 01:09:48,348
Welcome to the Cube, soldiers.
I assume the mission is complete.

627
01:09:48,350 --> 01:09:50,116
Yes, sir.

628
01:09:50,118 --> 01:09:51,851
May I?

629
01:09:54,021 --> 01:09:56,690
It's beautiful.

630
01:09:56,692 --> 01:09:58,158
Come.

631
01:10:02,997 --> 01:10:05,098
Your son Meat didn't make it.

632
01:10:05,100 --> 01:10:08,068
He's quite the artist.

633
01:10:08,070 --> 01:10:10,270
Son? Humph.

634
01:10:10,272 --> 01:10:14,374
Hardly. Boy.

635
01:10:15,977 --> 01:10:17,944
We, uh...

636
01:10:17,946 --> 01:10:19,879
always had that.

637
01:10:20,948 --> 01:10:23,950
That's good for you.

638
01:10:42,637 --> 01:10:44,137
What happened to them?

639
01:10:44,139 --> 01:10:47,073
Well, they're the ones
we're trying to save,

640
01:10:47,075 --> 01:10:51,344
soldiers stuck in limbo,
one foot in this world,

641
01:10:51,346 --> 01:10:55,382
the other who knows where?
We've been searching for a cure

642
01:10:55,384 --> 01:10:58,918
for our best soldiers that
have been damaged in battle,

643
01:10:58,920 --> 01:11:00,320
something that'll bring them back

644
01:11:00,322 --> 01:11:05,259
or to enhance the ones we have.

645
01:11:09,697 --> 01:11:11,164
Come.

646
01:11:21,075 --> 01:11:23,943
How are you gonna save them?

647
01:11:23,945 --> 01:11:28,081
With this, the staff of Moses.
That doesn't look like much.

648
01:11:28,083 --> 01:11:31,184
Yeah. That's what we
thought at first, too.

649
01:11:31,186 --> 01:11:32,252
Remember the A-bomb?

650
01:11:32,254 --> 01:11:36,956
Manhattan Project, 1945?
The explosion heard round the world?

651
01:11:36,958 --> 01:11:39,259
Well, that was this.
Misfire. Heh.

652
01:11:39,261 --> 01:11:42,796
Boy, we had to spin that one for
years every which way we could.

653
01:11:42,798 --> 01:11:45,265
That's when we realized that
we didn't know everything.

654
01:11:45,267 --> 01:11:48,735
That's why it was so hard to
put all the pieces together.

655
01:11:48,737 --> 01:11:51,705
Decades of research
and development.

656
01:11:52,440 --> 01:11:55,909
But you two, you two,

657
01:11:55,911 --> 01:11:58,445
you brought us the
final missing piece.

658
01:11:58,447 --> 01:12:01,247
General, the assassin...

659
01:12:01,249 --> 01:12:02,148
Nomad.

660
01:12:02,150 --> 01:12:05,785
Whatever it is,
it's right outside the door.

661
01:12:07,455 --> 01:12:08,855
Yeah, we know.

662
01:12:08,857 --> 01:12:11,491
Well, isn't that a priority?
It can wait.

663
01:12:11,493 --> 01:12:13,259
Now that we're all here,

664
01:12:13,261 --> 01:12:16,763
let's get down to business, hmm?

665
01:12:19,233 --> 01:12:23,336
Everyone from the Knights Templar

666
01:12:23,338 --> 01:12:26,139
to Franklin Roosevelt himself

667
01:12:26,141 --> 01:12:31,277
searched for the Staff of Moses...

668
01:12:35,015 --> 01:12:38,184
but only we found the map.

669
01:12:39,286 --> 01:12:44,023
Who'd have thought that it was engraved
on the skull of Moses himself?

670
01:12:44,025 --> 01:12:46,826
And how does that
help us in war today?

671
01:12:46,828 --> 01:12:48,928
I had lofty ideals, Captain.

672
01:12:48,930 --> 01:12:52,031
I thought if I could harness
its power of immortality,

673
01:12:52,033 --> 01:12:55,201
I could create an invincible army.
If it could bring back one man,

674
01:12:55,203 --> 01:13:00,140
why not... why not the greatest
soldiers that ever lived?

675
01:13:00,474 --> 01:13:04,277
But then the wars, eh, the
wars, they got uninteresting.

676
01:13:04,279 --> 01:13:08,882
Hell, it wasn't long before we didn't
even have anyone left to fight.

677
01:13:09,016 --> 01:13:14,354
So we had to create new enemies,
and I went treasure hunting.

678
01:13:14,356 --> 01:13:16,790
What about them?
You'll see.

679
01:13:53,594 --> 01:13:55,061
What are you doing?

680
01:13:55,063 --> 01:13:58,431
I am letting him in.

681
01:14:04,038 --> 01:14:07,307
Kill the hostile.

682
01:14:54,456 --> 01:14:59,292
Why didn't we get one of those?
Prototype.

683
01:14:59,294 --> 01:15:01,628
Technically, they don't exist,

684
01:15:01,630 --> 01:15:05,298
and they don't usually work.

685
01:15:12,907 --> 01:15:15,608
Something's wrong.
It isn't working.

686
01:15:17,011 --> 01:15:21,014
My God.
I can't believe this.

687
01:15:21,649 --> 01:15:23,917
This is Attila's son.

688
01:15:23,919 --> 01:15:26,419
I think that he is the key.

689
01:15:26,421 --> 01:15:30,089
You told me the blood was what we needed!
What the hell's going on, Professor?

690
01:15:30,091 --> 01:15:34,027
For it to work, you must drink
directly from the staff.

691
01:15:34,029 --> 01:15:35,428
General...

692
01:15:37,331 --> 01:15:38,932
this isn't about soldiers.

693
01:15:38,934 --> 01:15:41,668
Now, what's going on here?

694
01:15:43,938 --> 01:15:48,341
The truth, General.
He is dying.

695
01:15:50,377 --> 01:15:56,182
Five years ago, I was diagnosed
with inoperable cancer.

696
01:15:56,184 --> 01:16:01,254
I fought it, but unless I have a
little help, it's over for me,

697
01:16:01,256 --> 01:16:04,457
all my plans and
all my dreams done.

698
01:16:04,459 --> 01:16:07,961
Now, there's one thing
that can save me

699
01:16:07,963 --> 01:16:10,363
and buy me the time that I need.

700
01:16:10,365 --> 01:16:12,999
This mission had a means to an end.

701
01:16:13,001 --> 01:16:16,135
I don't want to die, Vito.

702
01:16:17,304 --> 01:16:20,540
You're crazy.
Now we have one loose end to tie up.

703
01:16:20,542 --> 01:16:22,542
No, the mission's over.

704
01:16:22,544 --> 01:16:26,079
Not yet. Kill her.

705
01:16:27,648 --> 01:16:30,750
What?
Kill McVie.

706
01:16:30,752 --> 01:16:35,121
She knows everything,
and she is expendable.

707
01:16:35,123 --> 01:16:38,257
No. No, sir.
Disobeying orders?

708
01:16:38,259 --> 01:16:39,659
Eh, that's not like you.

709
01:16:39,661 --> 01:16:43,730
The mission was to deliver Project
Genesis, and we did that. It's over.

710
01:16:43,732 --> 01:16:48,568
This mission is over
when I say it is over!

711
01:16:50,070 --> 01:16:52,171
Now kill her!

712
01:16:54,408 --> 01:16:58,511
I'm not like you.
Come on, Captain.

713
01:16:58,513 --> 01:17:00,213
We're both military men here.

714
01:17:00,215 --> 01:17:05,451
All those men that you led into battle,
that never came home, they died for a lie.

715
01:17:05,653 --> 01:17:07,553
Bullshit.
That's bullshit!

716
01:17:07,555 --> 01:17:13,393
What, you think they... they just
mysteriously disappeared? Died?

717
01:17:13,395 --> 01:17:17,263
Did you think it was a coincidence?
Those are your lies.

718
01:17:18,298 --> 01:17:21,300
My God, look at you.

719
01:17:21,302 --> 01:17:23,403
You're so tormented by your demons,

720
01:17:23,405 --> 01:17:26,806
you don't even see what's
right in front of you.

721
01:17:27,708 --> 01:17:30,076
I am the demon that torments you!

722
01:17:30,078 --> 01:17:34,547
My men died for a cause!
That cause became me!

723
01:17:34,549 --> 01:17:38,384
Now, you are soldier!
You are my soldier!

724
01:17:38,552 --> 01:17:42,255
You obey orders!
That's what you do!

725
01:17:42,257 --> 01:17:46,259
Now kill her!
Negative, sir!

726
01:17:46,693 --> 01:17:50,263
Then you are expendable, too.

727
01:17:51,732 --> 01:17:52,732
Don't!

728
01:17:52,734 --> 01:17:57,103
It needs to be the Nomad's
blood, not yours!

729
01:18:01,608 --> 01:18:04,677
You see, Captain, the staff

730
01:18:04,679 --> 01:18:08,815
was to resurrect Attila
from beyond the grave,

731
01:18:08,817 --> 01:18:11,684
and his son, this Nomad,

732
01:18:11,686 --> 01:18:15,154
was just the tool
to bring him back.

733
01:18:28,135 --> 01:18:29,669
Hey, what is it?
What are you doing?

734
01:18:29,671 --> 01:18:32,705
It's for insurance.

735
01:18:49,189 --> 01:18:51,424
Go, go, go, go, go!

736
01:19:13,514 --> 01:19:16,215
Destroy your father.

737
01:19:30,597 --> 01:19:32,498
You all right?
Yeah. Yeah.

738
01:19:32,500 --> 01:19:36,435
What's going on?
It's father versus son now.

739
01:19:36,437 --> 01:19:37,937
Nice family.

740
01:20:15,309 --> 01:20:19,245
What are you doing?
I'm gonna buy us some time.

741
01:20:33,527 --> 01:20:34,994
Come on!
Fleetwood planted a bomb!

742
01:20:34,996 --> 01:20:37,964
We have to get out of
here before it goes off!

743
01:20:47,007 --> 01:20:49,675
Come on!

744
01:20:53,680 --> 01:20:55,848
Come on!

745
01:21:27,748 --> 01:21:31,851
You okay?
I've felt better.

746
01:21:34,054 --> 01:21:37,757
Mission complete?
For now.

747
01:21:38,025 --> 01:21:41,294
Your dad would have been
proud of you today.

748
01:21:41,296 --> 01:21:44,764
How do you know that?
Yeah, trust me, I know.

749
01:21:45,932 --> 01:21:49,302
So what kind of gum did you choose?

750
01:21:49,304 --> 01:21:50,469
I didn't.

751
01:21:50,471 --> 01:21:51,370
No?
Nah.

752
01:21:51,372 --> 01:21:53,806
I'm more of a chocolate guy.
