1
00:01:46,908 --> 00:01:48,610
- It's kinda tricky
to see right now,

2
00:01:48,643 --> 00:01:51,478
but if you start at
that northeast corner

3
00:01:51,512 --> 00:01:54,147
of those four stars
that form a square,

4
00:01:55,182 --> 00:01:57,351
that's the great
square of Pegasus.

5
00:01:58,853 --> 00:02:01,589
And coming off of it
is like that handle,

6
00:02:01,623 --> 00:02:03,457
that's not even
our galaxy anymore.

7
00:02:03,490 --> 00:02:05,158
That's, that's Andromeda.

8
00:02:06,527 --> 00:02:08,395
It's a whole other galaxy,

9
00:02:08,428 --> 00:02:10,698
2.5 million light years away.

10
00:02:13,635 --> 00:02:15,135
Andromeda's where they live.

11
00:02:30,685 --> 00:02:33,655
I was 15 when they
first took me.

12
00:02:36,423 --> 00:02:37,859
Oh.

13
00:02:37,892 --> 00:02:39,727
And that's how I got this.

14
00:02:39,761 --> 00:02:40,928
- Easy, sweetheart.
- No.

15
00:02:40,962 --> 00:02:42,864
It's not that.

16
00:02:42,897 --> 00:02:43,731
See.

17
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:47,902
That's where they
extracted the DNA.

18
00:02:47,935 --> 00:02:51,405
And then two days
ago I saw them again.

19
00:02:58,579 --> 00:02:59,647
You ever wake up from a dream

20
00:02:59,681 --> 00:03:00,748
and it's like you're
still dreaming?

21
00:03:13,293 --> 00:03:13,928
Hello?

22
00:03:17,732 --> 00:03:18,533
Hi, are you awake?

23
00:03:18,566 --> 00:03:19,801
I saw a light on.

24
00:03:19,834 --> 00:03:20,835
Oh, I thought I saw a light.

25
00:03:20,868 --> 00:03:22,469
But you're Peter, yeah?

26
00:03:22,503 --> 00:03:23,437
Like your name is Peter.

27
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:24,872
- No, I'm,

28
00:03:24,906 --> 00:03:27,675
I don't have a name and
nobody's here is to go away now.

29
00:03:27,709 --> 00:03:29,409
- Okay, well even if
that's, that's not your name,

30
00:03:29,443 --> 00:03:31,946
I'd really, really
love to talk with you

31
00:03:31,979 --> 00:03:34,247
really quickly if,
if possible please?

32
00:03:34,281 --> 00:03:35,248
- Oh my God.

33
00:03:35,282 --> 00:03:37,985
Hey, whoever's out there,
just fuck off, okay.

34
00:03:38,019 --> 00:03:39,787
- I totally get that.

35
00:03:39,821 --> 00:03:40,988
I'll just,

36
00:03:41,022 --> 00:03:43,256
I will go away, I promise.

37
00:03:43,290 --> 00:03:45,827
As soon as you just talk
to me for like 10 seconds.

38
00:03:47,562 --> 00:03:48,395
Hello.

39
00:03:53,868 --> 00:03:55,703
- It's not even
six in the morning.

40
00:03:55,737 --> 00:03:57,337
I was in bed, you know,

41
00:03:57,370 --> 00:03:59,774
asleep having this really
terrific little dream

42
00:03:59,807 --> 00:04:00,742
and I would love,

43
00:04:00,775 --> 00:04:02,442
love, love to get back to that.

44
00:04:02,476 --> 00:04:05,479
So I need you to just
take all of this away.

45
00:04:05,513 --> 00:04:06,514
- Do you have a car?

46
00:04:07,715 --> 00:04:08,649
I need a car.

47
00:04:08,683 --> 00:04:09,884
- No, I don't
have a car, goodbye.

48
00:04:09,917 --> 00:04:11,018
- I, I, I, wait.

49
00:04:11,052 --> 00:04:12,820
Just,

50
00:04:12,854 --> 00:04:13,487
I believe you.

51
00:04:13,521 --> 00:04:14,522
I really do.

52
00:04:14,555 --> 00:04:17,390
It's just that I heard
you on the phone one time

53
00:04:17,424 --> 00:04:18,092
in the hallway.

54
00:04:18,126 --> 00:04:19,493
What, I, I wasn't eavesdropping.

55
00:04:19,527 --> 00:04:20,561
I was just going
up to my apartment.

56
00:04:20,595 --> 00:04:24,297
And you said that you had
less than zero interest

57
00:04:24,331 --> 00:04:27,300
in selling my, your
mother effing car.

58
00:04:28,368 --> 00:04:29,837
- What, no, goodbye.

59
00:04:54,294 --> 00:04:55,462
- Your name is Peter.

60
00:04:55,495 --> 00:04:58,833
It's written on the buzzer
in the front of the building.

61
00:04:58,866 --> 00:05:00,535
I see it almost every day.

62
00:05:02,136 --> 00:05:04,404
Me and David are four C.

63
00:05:04,437 --> 00:05:06,874
So, so your name is
right below his name.

64
00:05:09,944 --> 00:05:11,378
Peter, I can pay you.

65
00:05:17,718 --> 00:05:18,686
- How much?

66
00:05:18,719 --> 00:05:19,854
- $1,700.

67
00:05:19,887 --> 00:05:20,855
- 1700?

68
00:05:20,888 --> 00:05:21,823
Jesus, you've got money,

69
00:05:21,856 --> 00:05:23,691
go find your own stupid car.

70
00:05:23,724 --> 00:05:24,892
- The thing is,

71
00:05:24,926 --> 00:05:26,393
I, I, I would, but I can't

72
00:05:26,426 --> 00:05:26,861
'cause I don't have a license.

73
00:05:26,894 --> 00:05:27,929
- So, okay.

74
00:05:27,962 --> 00:05:30,832
You want me to let you,
a person I do not know,

75
00:05:30,865 --> 00:05:32,365
but has no driver's license,

76
00:05:32,399 --> 00:05:33,901
that's the one thing
that I do know,

77
00:05:33,935 --> 00:05:36,737
to drive my car to where?

78
00:05:36,771 --> 00:05:37,839
- Oh, it's really not that far.

79
00:05:37,872 --> 00:05:38,840
It's just a few hours up north.

80
00:05:38,873 --> 00:05:41,108
It's to visit my sister.

81
00:05:41,142 --> 00:05:42,643
- Visit your sister where?

82
00:05:43,476 --> 00:05:44,779
- This little,

83
00:05:45,746 --> 00:05:46,681
little town.

84
00:05:46,714 --> 00:05:49,817
Little cute little
town near Lapeter City.

85
00:05:49,851 --> 00:05:50,852
- In Canada?

86
00:05:50,885 --> 00:05:51,986
- Yeah, she's Canadian.

87
00:05:52,019 --> 00:05:54,487
I will pay you $1,700 cash,

88
00:05:54,522 --> 00:05:56,524
but I have to leave right now.

89
00:05:56,557 --> 00:06:00,094
Okay, I have to be
there at 9:27 PM

90
00:06:00,127 --> 00:06:01,729
three days from today.

91
00:06:01,762 --> 00:06:03,998
And I cannot be
late, I just can't.

92
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:05,633
- Late to visit your sister?

93
00:06:06,466 --> 00:06:07,367
- Uh-huh.

94
00:06:12,073 --> 00:06:12,907
- I'm going back to sleep now.

95
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:13,774
- No please.

96
00:06:13,808 --> 00:06:15,176
Just do this one
little favor for me--

97
00:06:15,209 --> 00:06:16,777
- No, I think I need
you to go actually.

98
00:06:16,811 --> 00:06:17,712
- But I, it's
only a few days, I don't--

99
00:06:17,745 --> 00:06:18,713
- I think I need you to go.

100
00:06:18,746 --> 00:06:20,615
- I don't know anyone else.
- Not my problem.

101
00:06:20,648 --> 00:06:21,448
It's not my problem.

102
00:06:21,481 --> 00:06:22,717
- I have no one, come on.

103
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:23,584
- Fucking listen.

104
00:06:24,919 --> 00:06:26,486
I do not know you.

105
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:28,789
I do not like you just
from two minutes of this

106
00:06:28,823 --> 00:06:30,925
and I'm not letting you
borrow my goddamn car.

107
00:07:27,581 --> 00:07:29,216
Half the money beforehand.

108
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:30,851
Now.

109
00:07:30,885 --> 00:07:31,852
- Whoa, what?

110
00:07:31,886 --> 00:07:33,187
- What, what?

111
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:35,957
If I get half of
the 1700 in advance,

112
00:07:35,990 --> 00:07:37,825
you can borrow Shay's,

113
00:07:37,858 --> 00:07:40,528
borrow my car on
three conditions.

114
00:07:40,561 --> 00:07:42,863
One, no eating and
no drinking inside.

115
00:07:42,897 --> 00:07:44,832
You don't strike me
as a very tidy person.

116
00:07:44,865 --> 00:07:45,833
Two, no parallel parking.

117
00:07:45,866 --> 00:07:47,835
If you need to stop, you
find a nice easy spot

118
00:07:47,868 --> 00:07:48,803
where you can pull right into.

119
00:07:48,836 --> 00:07:51,005
No back and forth, no
adjusting the wheel.

120
00:07:51,038 --> 00:07:53,473
And, and three I come too.

121
00:07:55,609 --> 00:07:56,210
- You,

122
00:07:56,243 --> 00:07:58,012
you wanna drive to Canada?

123
00:07:58,045 --> 00:07:59,280
- God, no.

124
00:07:59,313 --> 00:08:00,147
I,

125
00:08:02,984 --> 00:08:03,985
no,

126
00:08:04,986 --> 00:08:07,888
but I was supposed to
before and I didn't.

127
00:08:07,922 --> 00:08:08,990
And if I don't go
now, I never will.

128
00:08:09,023 --> 00:08:10,624
So,

129
00:08:10,658 --> 00:08:12,126
1700, half up front.

130
00:08:14,261 --> 00:08:16,063
- Anything, anything
you want, I,

131
00:08:16,097 --> 00:08:18,065
you dunno how much
this means to me.

132
00:08:21,736 --> 00:08:22,570
Here.

133
00:08:28,075 --> 00:08:29,043
- Okay.

134
00:08:29,076 --> 00:08:30,978
Wait here, I'll pack.

135
00:08:31,012 --> 00:08:33,147
- Oh, Mr. Peter H,

136
00:08:35,016 --> 00:08:36,083
Winona J.

137
00:08:38,019 --> 00:08:39,120
J for Jordan.

138
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:47,128
Can already tell this
is gonna be amazing.

139
00:08:47,161 --> 00:08:48,162
- Yeah.

140
00:08:48,195 --> 00:08:49,563
So fucking amazing.

141
00:08:51,932 --> 00:08:52,833
- So amazing.

142
00:09:10,217 --> 00:09:11,318
- I don't know.

143
00:09:11,352 --> 00:09:14,021
It's not like you have like
the official paperwork.

144
00:09:14,055 --> 00:09:15,289
- What are you
looking for here, huh?

145
00:09:15,322 --> 00:09:16,323
The deed of sale.

146
00:09:16,357 --> 00:09:16,891
You don't have that.

147
00:09:16,924 --> 00:09:17,925
You don't have anything.

148
00:09:17,958 --> 00:09:19,827
You have less than I do
for if we're counting

149
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:21,162
because at least
I have her keys.

150
00:09:21,195 --> 00:09:22,930
- Well, I too

151
00:09:22,963 --> 00:09:24,265
have a pair of
keys right inside.

152
00:09:24,298 --> 00:09:26,067
- Nico, don't be
a fucking prick.

153
00:09:27,635 --> 00:09:32,073
- Listen here you little
Judy Garland piece of shit.

154
00:09:32,106 --> 00:09:34,075
This is Shay's car, okay?

155
00:09:34,108 --> 00:09:36,077
And I am Shay's brother,

156
00:09:36,110 --> 00:09:37,144
so I don't know if she told you

157
00:09:37,178 --> 00:09:38,813
that you could have this car,

158
00:09:38,846 --> 00:09:40,614
but I see no proof of that.

159
00:09:40,648 --> 00:09:41,849
All I see

160
00:09:41,882 --> 00:09:44,151
is two broke asses
in my front yard.

161
00:09:44,185 --> 00:09:45,219
- Nico.

162
00:09:46,787 --> 00:09:47,721
Nico.

163
00:09:49,090 --> 00:09:53,027
So we just wanna
borrow your car.

164
00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:53,694
That's it.

165
00:09:53,727 --> 00:09:55,296
It's a personal favor for me

166
00:09:55,329 --> 00:09:57,731
so that I can go
visit my mom up north

167
00:09:57,765 --> 00:09:59,700
and you're gonna get it back.

168
00:09:59,733 --> 00:10:00,367
Okay?

169
00:10:01,869 --> 00:10:03,237
You seem like such a

170
00:10:03,270 --> 00:10:06,273
sweet, sensitive kind of guy.

171
00:10:07,842 --> 00:10:09,210
You know, it would
mean so much to me.

172
00:10:11,212 --> 00:10:12,213
- Who's this bitch?

173
00:10:12,246 --> 00:10:13,647
- My Tai chi instructor.

174
00:10:13,681 --> 00:10:15,216
Nico, we're taking the car.

175
00:10:15,249 --> 00:10:16,083
Shay gave it to me.

176
00:10:16,117 --> 00:10:17,151
It's mine.

177
00:10:17,184 --> 00:10:18,152
End of discussion.

178
00:10:18,185 --> 00:10:19,186
- Man, fuck you.

179
00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:20,087
- Fuck you.

180
00:10:20,121 --> 00:10:20,621
- No, fuck you.

181
00:10:20,654 --> 00:10:21,556
- Fuck you.

182
00:10:21,590 --> 00:10:23,124
- You said you had
the other key, right?

183
00:10:23,157 --> 00:10:24,058
- Yes, I
have the other key.

184
00:10:24,091 --> 00:10:25,926
- Okay, so could you go get it

185
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:28,729
so we could maybe compare keys?

186
00:10:29,763 --> 00:10:32,266
I don't know, maybe there was
like a mistake or something.

187
00:10:32,299 --> 00:10:34,301
And if we have the wrong key,

188
00:10:34,335 --> 00:10:35,236
then you were right

189
00:10:35,269 --> 00:10:37,238
and we will just move along.

190
00:10:37,271 --> 00:10:38,105
Thank you.

191
00:10:38,939 --> 00:10:40,241
- Fine.

192
00:10:40,274 --> 00:10:42,109
But I have business
dealings to conduct.

193
00:10:42,143 --> 00:10:43,244
I'm an entrepreneur.

194
00:10:43,277 --> 00:10:45,279
I make money moves.

195
00:10:55,189 --> 00:10:56,123
- Gimme the keys.

196
00:10:56,157 --> 00:10:57,124
- What?

197
00:10:57,158 --> 00:10:58,359
- Give me the keys.

198
00:10:58,392 --> 00:10:59,226
- No.
- Give the--

199
00:10:59,260 --> 00:10:59,960
- No.

200
00:10:59,994 --> 00:11:01,195
Hey, hey, stop, don't touch me.

201
00:11:01,228 --> 00:11:02,763
Wait.

202
00:11:02,796 --> 00:11:03,397
Wait, Winona.

203
00:11:03,430 --> 00:11:04,765
Winona, this is a crime.

204
00:11:04,798 --> 00:11:05,933
This is stealing.

205
00:11:05,966 --> 00:11:08,068
No, no, no.

206
00:11:08,102 --> 00:11:08,903
No.

207
00:11:08,936 --> 00:11:09,937
Shame,

208
00:11:09,970 --> 00:11:11,038
shame,

209
00:11:11,071 --> 00:11:12,239
shame.

210
00:11:12,273 --> 00:11:13,274
He's gonna be back
in 10 seconds,

211
00:11:13,307 --> 00:11:14,775
I'm not getting,

212
00:11:14,808 --> 00:11:15,809
there's a moral code.
- Listen.

213
00:11:15,843 --> 00:11:17,211
I am going with or without you,

214
00:11:17,244 --> 00:11:18,479
so get in the goddamn car.

215
00:11:18,513 --> 00:11:19,747
Ugh, let's go,

216
00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:21,782
come on, hurry up.

217
00:11:21,815 --> 00:11:22,716
- Goddamn it.

218
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:24,218
- Come on,
hurry, hurry, hurry.

219
00:11:24,251 --> 00:11:25,085
- Shit.

220
00:11:25,119 --> 00:11:26,120
Fuck.

221
00:11:52,947 --> 00:11:54,348
Winona.

222
00:11:54,381 --> 00:11:55,883
Winona, pull over.

223
00:11:57,084 --> 00:11:59,253
Pull over the goddamn car.

224
00:12:05,527 --> 00:12:06,360
- Hey.

225
00:12:07,962 --> 00:12:09,330
Hey.

226
00:12:09,363 --> 00:12:10,364
What are you doing?

227
00:12:10,397 --> 00:12:12,199
- Oh, just calling the cops.

228
00:12:12,233 --> 00:12:14,268
- Please don't call the cops.

229
00:12:17,171 --> 00:12:19,773
- You stole a fucking car.

230
00:12:19,807 --> 00:12:22,476
- No, I helped you
get your car back.

231
00:12:24,579 --> 00:12:25,946
- This is insane.

232
00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:27,348
This is fucking insane.

233
00:12:36,190 --> 00:12:37,458
What are you doing Winona?

234
00:12:39,594 --> 00:12:41,395
Where are you trying to take us?

235
00:12:44,064 --> 00:12:45,366
Fuck it, I'm calling the cops.

236
00:12:45,399 --> 00:12:47,301
- No, just, just wait a second.

237
00:12:48,269 --> 00:12:49,336
- I'd like to
report a stolen vehicle--

238
00:12:49,370 --> 00:12:50,371
- Fine.
- In the vicinity--

239
00:12:50,404 --> 00:12:52,507
- Fine, fine, fine, fine--
- Third Street and--

240
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:54,174
- I will tell you.

241
00:12:56,210 --> 00:12:57,411
I will tell you.

242
00:13:05,119 --> 00:13:05,953
Hang up.

243
00:13:14,295 --> 00:13:15,329
Thank you.

244
00:13:18,299 --> 00:13:19,933
Peter,

245
00:13:19,967 --> 00:13:21,235
I promise

246
00:13:21,268 --> 00:13:23,337
that this will all
make a lot more sense

247
00:13:23,370 --> 00:13:24,171
when I can show you.

248
00:13:24,204 --> 00:13:25,507
- Show me what?

249
00:13:32,212 --> 00:13:33,414
- The abduction site.

250
00:13:36,383 --> 00:13:37,418
- The abduction site?

251
00:13:43,924 --> 00:13:44,925
- Yeah, so

252
00:13:47,094 --> 00:13:48,929
would you please
get back in the car?

253
00:14:27,267 --> 00:14:29,036
- Let's go to the
abduction site.

254
00:15:47,214 --> 00:15:49,049
- And I remember it,

255
00:15:49,082 --> 00:15:50,184
it felt like

256
00:15:51,251 --> 00:15:52,520
riding in an elevator

257
00:15:52,554 --> 00:15:55,222
when you never even
heard of an elevator.

258
00:15:55,255 --> 00:15:57,257
And there's this computer

259
00:15:57,291 --> 00:16:00,762
that translates everything
you think or say.

260
00:16:00,795 --> 00:16:03,731
And they told me that I had
been chosen extra specially.

261
00:16:03,765 --> 00:16:04,666
And then they told
me their name,

262
00:16:04,699 --> 00:16:08,235
which doesn't actually
translate exactly.

263
00:16:10,572 --> 00:16:12,439
So we call them
the bridge people.

264
00:16:12,473 --> 00:16:13,675
- Ooh, huh, huh,

265
00:16:15,209 --> 00:16:16,744
the bridge people.

266
00:16:16,778 --> 00:16:19,079
Now, okay, I remember the cowboy

267
00:16:19,112 --> 00:16:20,447
and the construction guy.

268
00:16:20,481 --> 00:16:22,249
And what was the, oh,
the leather daddy.

269
00:16:22,282 --> 00:16:23,551
But who, who was the--

270
00:16:23,585 --> 00:16:25,018
- The bridge people
are an advanced,

271
00:16:25,052 --> 00:16:26,654
harmonious species.

272
00:16:27,689 --> 00:16:31,124
I mean, in Andromeda,
there's, there's like these,

273
00:16:31,158 --> 00:16:33,528
these things that
are like bridges,

274
00:16:33,561 --> 00:16:35,462
but that's like saying that

275
00:16:36,363 --> 00:16:38,131
sunsets are like grapefruits

276
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:42,035
and they sail
across the universe

277
00:16:42,069 --> 00:16:44,739
on these massive strands
of starlight and energy.

278
00:16:46,608 --> 00:16:48,543
But they need human DNA to

279
00:16:49,577 --> 00:16:50,612
reproduce.

280
00:16:50,645 --> 00:16:53,347
- By abducting new
bio teen girls?

281
00:16:53,380 --> 00:16:55,349
- We call it intersecting

282
00:16:55,382 --> 00:16:58,553
and in exchange for
allowing them to intersect,

283
00:16:58,586 --> 00:16:59,587
I get to go back.

284
00:16:59,621 --> 00:17:02,456
- Oh, you get to go back
to Mormon space camp?

285
00:17:02,489 --> 00:17:03,323
- It's not.

286
00:17:04,224 --> 00:17:06,528
That's what they told
me when I was 15.

287
00:17:06,561 --> 00:17:08,763
And then two days
ago I saw them again.

288
00:17:10,330 --> 00:17:12,567
They told me where I
had to be and when.

289
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:13,400
It's two days,

290
00:17:13,433 --> 00:17:14,836
twenty-one hours and

291
00:17:14,869 --> 00:17:16,136
four minutes.

292
00:17:18,338 --> 00:17:19,541
And if I miss it, that's it.

293
00:17:21,743 --> 00:17:23,443
But I won't

294
00:17:23,477 --> 00:17:25,813
because I have you

295
00:17:25,847 --> 00:17:27,180
and I have your car

296
00:17:29,149 --> 00:17:31,318
and you think I'm
delusional right now.

297
00:17:31,351 --> 00:17:33,253
- Oh, well how could I,

298
00:17:33,287 --> 00:17:37,124
when presented with such a
concise, logical argument.

299
00:17:37,157 --> 00:17:39,459
- You said you had to
be somewhere too, right?

300
00:17:43,163 --> 00:17:44,231
- One quick pit stop,

301
00:17:46,701 --> 00:17:49,436
a beach on this
ugly little lake.

302
00:17:50,672 --> 00:17:54,107
- Ooh, it's sounds
super duper romantic.

303
00:17:54,141 --> 00:17:55,510
- Not unless you got
got a cock and balls

304
00:17:55,543 --> 00:17:56,711
squirreled away somewhere.

305
00:17:56,744 --> 00:17:57,845
- How do you know I don't?

306
00:18:00,515 --> 00:18:03,216
Come on, let's rest up
before the border tomorrow.

307
00:18:07,655 --> 00:18:09,156
Canada, woo.

308
00:18:09,757 --> 00:18:11,458
- Darling, I am
not leaving this car.

309
00:18:11,491 --> 00:18:12,860
Fuck you very much.

310
00:18:12,894 --> 00:18:13,595
- I'm not gonna steal your car.

311
00:18:13,628 --> 00:18:14,796
- You already did.

312
00:18:14,829 --> 00:18:17,865
So go be crazy somewhere else
and let me sleep in peace.

313
00:18:17,899 --> 00:18:19,466
- Don't call me crazy.

314
00:18:19,499 --> 00:18:20,500
- What?

315
00:18:21,435 --> 00:18:22,670
- I said,

316
00:18:22,704 --> 00:18:24,237
just don't call me that.

317
00:18:26,306 --> 00:18:27,140
I'm not.

318
00:18:29,644 --> 00:18:30,878
And anyway, you're the
one who's all weird

319
00:18:30,912 --> 00:18:32,680
and horny for your big pink car.

320
00:18:34,716 --> 00:18:36,283
- It belonged to a friend.

321
00:19:53,027 --> 00:19:55,963
- It's just a
place I saw in a magazine.

322
00:19:59,332 --> 00:20:01,502
I only wanna go if it's us.

323
00:20:04,672 --> 00:20:05,973
Promise we'll go together,

324
00:20:08,609 --> 00:20:09,610
you and me.

325
00:20:12,479 --> 00:20:13,948
Cross your heart
and hope to die.

326
00:20:16,551 --> 00:20:17,384
Promise?

327
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:20,521
- I promise.

328
00:20:34,301 --> 00:20:35,737
- You sleep okay?

329
00:20:36,604 --> 00:20:37,705
- Yeah.

330
00:20:37,739 --> 00:20:38,371
Just,

331
00:20:40,407 --> 00:20:41,843
I've got a bad back, that's all.

332
00:20:43,310 --> 00:20:46,714
- Uh-huh, that's what that
nice comfy motel bed was for.

333
00:20:46,748 --> 00:20:48,516
Hopefully it's nothing a little

334
00:20:48,549 --> 00:20:50,852
Vicodin and whiskey
soda can't fix.

335
00:20:52,486 --> 00:20:53,721
- I don't drink.

336
00:20:53,755 --> 00:20:54,922
- You're sober?

337
00:20:56,958 --> 00:20:58,993
- No, I just don't drink.

338
00:21:01,863 --> 00:21:05,666
Oh, pull over, I gotta get
my passport out of the trunk.

339
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:06,534
- Don't need it.

340
00:21:07,568 --> 00:21:08,803
Takin' the back way.

341
00:21:08,836 --> 00:21:11,338
Secret threshold.
- Oh.

342
00:21:11,371 --> 00:21:13,406
So another crime.

343
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:14,374
- If we get caught.

344
00:21:14,876 --> 00:21:15,777
- Yeah.

345
00:21:15,810 --> 00:21:17,645
- You know when it's
just the two of us,

346
00:21:17,678 --> 00:21:18,880
you don't have to wear that.

347
00:21:20,347 --> 00:21:21,849
I mean, I don't
wanna be depressing,

348
00:21:21,883 --> 00:21:24,351
but if I got it, you got it.

349
00:21:24,384 --> 00:21:25,019
So.

350
00:21:35,696 --> 00:21:38,331
Now you can breathe
like the human being.

351
00:21:58,451 --> 00:21:59,620
Hey, hey, yeah.

352
00:21:59,654 --> 00:22:01,689
The spot you said a
couple minutes early.

353
00:22:02,824 --> 00:22:04,491
Yeah, yeah, I
brought a friend too.

354
00:22:04,525 --> 00:22:05,660
It's a,

355
00:22:05,693 --> 00:22:07,862
no no, no, it's not
that kind of friend.

356
00:22:07,895 --> 00:22:08,796
But,

357
00:22:09,063 --> 00:22:10,531
thank you for asking.

358
00:22:23,177 --> 00:22:25,445
I feel fine, I feel fine.

359
00:22:26,881 --> 00:22:29,449
I feel functional,
you know, I'm like,

360
00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:34,421
yeah, well, you know,
it's not nothing for me.

361
00:22:37,191 --> 00:22:38,025
Okay.

362
00:22:39,126 --> 00:22:40,695
Okay, Suzee.

363
00:22:40,728 --> 00:22:42,495
Okay, I love you.

364
00:22:42,530 --> 00:22:43,130
Love you.

365
00:22:43,164 --> 00:22:43,965
See you soon.

366
00:22:43,998 --> 00:22:44,932
Okay bye.

367
00:22:44,966 --> 00:22:45,833
Bye.

368
00:23:06,754 --> 00:23:08,823
- You know, you have a phone

369
00:23:08,856 --> 00:23:10,024
and I have a phone,

370
00:23:10,057 --> 00:23:10,925
which makes wait for it,

371
00:23:10,958 --> 00:23:11,759
wait, wait,

372
00:23:11,792 --> 00:23:13,628
two phones.

373
00:23:13,661 --> 00:23:14,595
- Too dangerous.

374
00:23:15,796 --> 00:23:17,698
Unless it's a life
or death emergency.

375
00:23:19,901 --> 00:23:21,769
You know, they can
trace outgoing calls.

376
00:23:21,802 --> 00:23:23,470
- Who?

377
00:23:23,504 --> 00:23:25,673
- Anyone who really wants to.

378
00:23:57,238 --> 00:23:58,940
There she is.

379
00:23:58,973 --> 00:24:00,741
- You can
tell your mother

380
00:24:00,775 --> 00:24:02,944
she can take whatever
she fucking wants

381
00:24:05,246 --> 00:24:07,515
It's my dream for
when I get back.

382
00:24:07,548 --> 00:24:08,716
Win, win, win.

383
00:24:11,052 --> 00:24:13,654
- Suzee, meet my current
traveling companion, Peter.

384
00:24:13,688 --> 00:24:14,388
Peter, this is Suzee.

385
00:24:14,422 --> 00:24:15,790
She's gonna help us cross over.

386
00:24:15,823 --> 00:24:16,624
- Oh, glorious.

387
00:24:16,657 --> 00:24:17,892
Which way is Canada?

388
00:24:17,925 --> 00:24:18,859
- Didn't anybody ever teach you

389
00:24:18,893 --> 00:24:20,962
the shortest distance
between two points?

390
00:24:22,663 --> 00:24:24,065
Straight fucking line, baby.

391
00:24:50,658 --> 00:24:51,726
You all want?

392
00:24:52,660 --> 00:24:54,228
This is some God tear shit.

393
00:24:54,261 --> 00:24:55,663
- Yeah, I could take some.

394
00:24:55,696 --> 00:24:57,698
- No, we do not.

395
00:25:01,068 --> 00:25:02,036
- You know, you'll
get a tummy ache

396
00:25:02,069 --> 00:25:03,804
if you keep reading in the car.

397
00:25:14,281 --> 00:25:15,216
- Here's something.

398
00:25:16,717 --> 00:25:18,986
Don't ever talk to
me like I'm a child

399
00:25:19,020 --> 00:25:20,621
or use words like "tummy"

400
00:25:20,654 --> 00:25:24,025
or "grumpy" or "wa wa
wa" that sort of sound.

401
00:25:24,058 --> 00:25:25,726
I'm a fully adult man--
- I'm sorry.

402
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:27,028
I'm sorry, okay.

403
00:25:29,063 --> 00:25:30,731
- Fuck me.

404
00:25:38,305 --> 00:25:39,240
Do not touch me.

405
00:25:47,148 --> 00:25:49,784
Suzee, you gonna get scooped
up by the little green men too?

406
00:25:49,817 --> 00:25:51,052
- No.

407
00:25:51,085 --> 00:25:51,919
Nah.

408
00:25:54,889 --> 00:25:57,625
This planet might be
a worn out crap sack

409
00:25:57,658 --> 00:25:59,794
just spinning through the void,

410
00:25:59,827 --> 00:26:02,096
but goddammit, I am fond of it.

411
00:26:04,398 --> 00:26:08,069
I spent 16 years in finance.

412
00:26:08,102 --> 00:26:09,804
That's a one and a six.

413
00:26:10,838 --> 00:26:12,139
Then one day

414
00:26:12,173 --> 00:26:13,707
I realized that
all those numbers

415
00:26:13,741 --> 00:26:16,377
I spent years obsessing over,

416
00:26:16,410 --> 00:26:17,244
they were

417
00:26:18,379 --> 00:26:20,047
all made up,

418
00:26:20,081 --> 00:26:20,948
pure fiction,

419
00:26:22,116 --> 00:26:23,084
which

420
00:26:24,018 --> 00:26:27,221
led me to the most
important step of all.

421
00:26:27,254 --> 00:26:28,155
- Self-reflection.

422
00:26:29,890 --> 00:26:30,691
- What?

423
00:26:30,724 --> 00:26:31,959
- Self-reflection.

424
00:26:32,893 --> 00:26:33,894
- No drugs.

425
00:26:42,269 --> 00:26:44,171
Easy around the yellow stumps.

426
00:26:44,205 --> 00:26:46,240
Okay, they got electronic
sensors buried underneath.

427
00:26:46,273 --> 00:26:48,008
- That cannot possibly be true.

428
00:26:49,977 --> 00:26:51,112
- It is.

429
00:27:18,105 --> 00:27:19,240
We made it, my people.

430
00:27:28,015 --> 00:27:30,184
We're on the other side.

431
00:27:31,218 --> 00:27:32,253
- Don't.

432
00:27:36,056 --> 00:27:38,225
This is to ease your passage.

433
00:27:38,259 --> 00:27:39,226
Here, take it.

434
00:27:39,260 --> 00:27:40,728
No, no, no.

435
00:27:40,761 --> 00:27:41,328
Take this.
- Come on.

436
00:27:41,362 --> 00:27:41,729
- This for you.

437
00:27:41,762 --> 00:27:42,730
Call me, no,

438
00:27:42,763 --> 00:27:45,733
whenever you're ready to
return to reality, okay?

439
00:27:50,838 --> 00:27:53,140
You know I'm gonna
fucking miss you.

440
00:27:54,008 --> 00:27:55,075
You know that.

441
00:27:59,914 --> 00:28:01,215
Say hi to the universe for me.

442
00:28:02,216 --> 00:28:03,217
Go.

443
00:28:03,751 --> 00:28:04,752
Go.

444
00:29:11,051 --> 00:29:11,952
- Jesus.

445
00:29:11,986 --> 00:29:13,287
Just crack it over
the back of my skull.

446
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:14,421
Skip the niceties.

447
00:29:14,455 --> 00:29:17,291
- Are you paying
for food or affection?

448
00:29:18,892 --> 00:29:21,328
- That is the most rational
person I've ever met.

449
00:29:22,429 --> 00:29:23,264
Hey.

450
00:29:23,897 --> 00:29:24,832
Hey.

451
00:29:24,865 --> 00:29:26,267
Cut it out, you're an adult.

452
00:29:27,067 --> 00:29:30,505
So I take it your a
whore of some sort.

453
00:29:30,538 --> 00:29:31,372
What?

454
00:29:33,541 --> 00:29:34,875
- I do sex work.

455
00:29:34,908 --> 00:29:37,211
That is a thing that I do.

456
00:29:39,313 --> 00:29:41,048
And sometimes it's camming

457
00:29:41,081 --> 00:29:43,417
and sometimes it's stripping.

458
00:29:43,450 --> 00:29:44,785
Occasional dirty video.

459
00:29:47,087 --> 00:29:49,990
I escort but that's not
really possible at the moment.

460
00:29:50,024 --> 00:29:52,326
- Ever consider a job where
the skirt and panties stay on?

461
00:29:52,359 --> 00:29:54,928
- I am a human being
who does sex work.

462
00:29:54,962 --> 00:29:57,264
That is a thing that I do.

463
00:29:57,298 --> 00:29:58,332
Okay?

464
00:29:58,365 --> 00:29:59,567
But I also like to think

465
00:29:59,601 --> 00:30:02,604
that you and me and
sometimes other people

466
00:30:02,637 --> 00:30:05,439
are more than the one or
two things that they do.

467
00:30:05,472 --> 00:30:06,574
Like if I ask you what you are.

468
00:30:06,608 --> 00:30:07,107
- Please don't.

469
00:30:07,141 --> 00:30:08,042
- You wouldn't say,

470
00:30:08,075 --> 00:30:09,511
oh, I'm just a pissed
off, miserable guy

471
00:30:09,544 --> 00:30:10,344
who hates everything.

472
00:30:10,377 --> 00:30:11,378
- No, I would say that.

473
00:30:11,412 --> 00:30:12,246
Excuse me.

474
00:30:15,082 --> 00:30:16,216
Hey,

475
00:30:16,250 --> 00:30:19,353
I've been asking for more
coffee for five fucking minutes.

476
00:30:23,157 --> 00:30:24,258
- Tell me about yourself, Peter.

477
00:30:24,291 --> 00:30:25,159
- Absolutely not.

478
00:30:26,393 --> 00:30:27,461
Excuse me.

479
00:30:27,494 --> 00:30:28,630
Can we just get a refill

480
00:30:28,663 --> 00:30:30,130
when our goddamn...

481
00:30:31,065 --> 00:30:32,166
Jesus.

482
00:30:32,199 --> 00:30:33,167
- Can I get a beer?

483
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:34,268
- No, no, she's joking.

484
00:30:38,005 --> 00:30:40,407
You wanna know who,
and or what I am Winona?

485
00:30:42,943 --> 00:30:43,545
All right.

486
00:30:45,045 --> 00:30:46,146
I,

487
00:30:46,180 --> 00:30:49,416
am a circle inside a circle

488
00:30:49,450 --> 00:30:51,318
inside a circle.

489
00:30:51,352 --> 00:30:53,454
I am a college educated

490
00:30:53,487 --> 00:30:55,255
homosexual dwarf

491
00:30:55,289 --> 00:30:58,225
in a world with little to no
patience for intelligence,

492
00:30:58,258 --> 00:30:59,960
for men who fuck other men,

493
00:30:59,993 --> 00:31:01,261
or for bodies that are not

494
00:31:01,295 --> 00:31:03,364
of a highly specific
make and model.

495
00:31:04,566 --> 00:31:05,366
I,

496
00:31:09,370 --> 00:31:10,572
am unemployed.

497
00:31:14,475 --> 00:31:15,376
I'm balding.

498
00:31:19,581 --> 00:31:21,248
I'm prone to illness.

499
00:31:25,252 --> 00:31:27,921
Statistically, I'm gonna die
sooner rather than later.

500
00:31:27,955 --> 00:31:33,193
Oh, oh, oh and I am so
goddamn smart, Winona.

501
00:31:39,967 --> 00:31:43,671
Sometimes I feel like
I know everything

502
00:31:44,639 --> 00:31:46,006
and I know,

503
00:31:46,674 --> 00:31:47,642
I know

504
00:31:47,675 --> 00:31:50,545
that I'm not a part of anything.

505
00:32:10,632 --> 00:32:13,934
- You know, I used to
have a lot of self pity

506
00:32:15,235 --> 00:32:18,573
when I thought
that I had to live

507
00:32:18,606 --> 00:32:20,608
like this in this world.

508
00:32:23,645 --> 00:32:24,646
But I don't.

509
00:32:26,180 --> 00:32:28,315
So I don't.
- Unless you do.

510
00:32:28,348 --> 00:32:30,317
- But I don't.

511
00:33:43,691 --> 00:33:45,359
- First word, fuck.

512
00:33:45,392 --> 00:33:46,628
Second word, no.

513
00:33:47,762 --> 00:33:50,397
- It will be so, so
neat and so clean.

514
00:33:50,430 --> 00:33:52,667
- I don't care,
the answer is no.

515
00:33:52,700 --> 00:33:55,435
- But it ain't a real
road trip without snacks.

516
00:33:55,469 --> 00:33:57,572
Oh, and road beers.

517
00:33:57,605 --> 00:33:58,438
- I,

518
00:33:59,674 --> 00:34:01,208
you don't have a license.

519
00:34:01,241 --> 00:34:02,010
You don't have a passport.

520
00:34:02,042 --> 00:34:04,444
We are in this
country illegally.

521
00:34:04,478 --> 00:34:05,813
And you want to not
only drink and drive,

522
00:34:05,847 --> 00:34:07,582
but drink while driving.

523
00:34:11,519 --> 00:34:12,820
- Road beers, road--

524
00:34:12,854 --> 00:34:14,756
- Winona, my answer is no.

525
00:34:14,789 --> 00:34:17,257
- Road beers, road
beers, road beers.

526
00:34:17,291 --> 00:34:18,526
- Winona.
- Road Beers.

527
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:19,561
Road beers.

528
00:34:19,594 --> 00:34:20,562
- Winona, shut the fuck up!

529
00:34:25,533 --> 00:34:26,466
Pump the gas and let's go.

530
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:28,803
This place is giving
me deliverance vibes.

531
00:34:29,671 --> 00:34:31,104
Hey, hey.

532
00:34:31,138 --> 00:34:31,839
I saw that.

533
00:34:31,873 --> 00:34:33,240
- You were supposed to.

534
00:34:57,297 --> 00:34:58,198
- Uh,

535
00:34:58,231 --> 00:34:59,667
hello.

536
00:34:59,701 --> 00:35:00,668
Hey.

537
00:35:00,702 --> 00:35:02,336
Hello.

538
00:35:02,369 --> 00:35:03,771
- Hey.

539
00:35:06,373 --> 00:35:07,274
- Sorry.

540
00:35:07,307 --> 00:35:09,309
We don't want to be weird but a,

541
00:35:10,277 --> 00:35:11,111
are you,

542
00:35:12,312 --> 00:35:12,947
her?

543
00:35:14,414 --> 00:35:15,650
- I don't think I know you guys.

544
00:35:15,683 --> 00:35:16,651
I'm sorry.
- No, no.

545
00:35:16,684 --> 00:35:17,585
No, no.

546
00:35:17,619 --> 00:35:19,386
Her like,

547
00:35:19,419 --> 00:35:20,387
dude, show her the...

548
00:35:21,355 --> 00:35:22,356
<i>- Hey, everybody.</i>

549
00:35:22,389 --> 00:35:23,457
<i>Winona here.</i>

550
00:35:23,490 --> 00:35:25,760

558
00:35:42,877 --> 00:35:44,712
- We've got an appointment

559
00:35:44,746 --> 00:35:45,747
Let's get going.

560
00:35:45,780 --> 00:35:46,714

00:35:46,748 --> 00:35:47,682

- Sorry, what was that there?

567
00:35:56,256 --> 00:35:56,958
- Fuck you,

569
00:35:58,559 --> 00:35:59,393
- All right guys,

00:35:59,426 --> 00:36:01,596
let's calm down with
the name calling.

571
00:36:03,998 --> 00:36:06,233
Peter, can we not right now?

572
00:36:06,266 --> 00:36:07,935
- All right, listen up.

573
00:36:07,969 --> 00:36:10,805
Before you ever
consider the notion of--

574
00:36:13,306 --> 00:36:14,509
- Get off of him.

575
00:36:14,542 --> 00:36:16,243
- Get off of me.

576
00:36:16,276 --> 00:36:17,645
Fuck you.

577
00:36:17,679 --> 00:36:19,814
- Get off of him.

578
00:36:24,719 --> 00:36:26,554
- Shit, wait,
wait, what's he doing?

579
00:36:26,587 --> 00:36:27,522
- I don't know.

580
00:36:27,555 --> 00:36:28,556
- What did you do?

581
00:36:28,589 --> 00:36:30,858
- Shit, I, I don't,
yeah, I don't, I don't.

00:36:30,892 --> 00:36:31,793

00:36:33,695 --> 00:36:34,896

00:36:34,929 --> 00:36:36,631
- Call 911

586
00:36:36,664 --> 00:36:37,532
Okay.

587
00:36:41,268 --> 00:36:42,704
- Shit, Peter, Peter.

588
00:36:42,737 --> 00:36:43,838
Peter.

589
00:36:43,871 --> 00:36:45,405
Help!

590
00:36:45,439 --> 00:36:46,741
Help!

591
00:36:46,774 --> 00:36:47,842
Help!

592
00:36:47,875 --> 00:36:48,676
Help!

593
00:36:48,710 --> 00:36:49,744
Peter, Peter.

594
00:36:49,777 --> 00:36:50,712
Peter.

595
00:36:52,747 --> 00:36:53,548
Peter?

596
00:37:00,655 --> 00:37:01,856
Are you okay?

597
00:37:02,724 --> 00:37:03,691
- Ah,

598
00:37:04,559 --> 00:37:05,727
moose fuckers.

599
00:37:10,798 --> 00:37:13,467
Everybody in this
goddamn fucking country,

600
00:37:14,001 --> 00:37:15,803
moose ender puffin' fuckers.

601
00:37:18,606 --> 00:37:21,341
Wish they hadn't
scuttled away so quick.

602
00:37:21,374 --> 00:37:23,044
Next I roll on the rack,

603
00:37:23,077 --> 00:37:25,613
roll around on the ground
and froth and kick.

604
00:37:25,646 --> 00:37:27,982
Once I pushed and
almost shit myself.

605
00:37:28,015 --> 00:37:28,883
- Peter.
- Almost.

606
00:37:28,916 --> 00:37:30,017
- You're okay?

607
00:37:30,051 --> 00:37:31,819
- Oh yeah.

608
00:37:31,853 --> 00:37:33,320
I'm gonna live forever.

609
00:37:35,890 --> 00:37:38,025
- Peter.
- Forever baby!

610
00:37:45,432 --> 00:37:46,299
- Peter.

611
00:37:48,836 --> 00:37:51,371
- So fucking tired.

612
00:37:52,540 --> 00:37:54,041
Let's go back home, please.

613
00:37:55,076 --> 00:37:56,744
- I'm sorry, there's no time.

614
00:38:02,650 --> 00:38:04,552
- This can't be real.

615
00:38:04,585 --> 00:38:05,520
None of this is happening.

616
00:38:05,553 --> 00:38:09,389
It's just, it's just
more bad pill dreams.

617
00:38:09,422 --> 00:38:13,060
I'm not gonna be every random
hick asshole's freak show.

618
00:38:13,094 --> 00:38:13,895
Okay?

619
00:38:17,532 --> 00:38:22,402
I just need to be back inside,
in my apartment, please.

620
00:38:22,435 --> 00:38:24,806
Please take me back.

621
00:38:24,839 --> 00:38:26,040
- We have to keep going.

622
00:38:28,009 --> 00:38:29,110
You need the money

623
00:38:29,143 --> 00:38:30,878
and you don't get the money
if we don't keep going.

624
00:38:30,912 --> 00:38:32,580
- Need the money.

625
00:38:32,613 --> 00:38:33,548
Fuck money.

626
00:38:35,149 --> 00:38:35,983
Fuck.

627
00:38:36,918 --> 00:38:38,385
- What about your friend?

628
00:38:45,660 --> 00:38:46,493
Come on.

629
00:38:48,663 --> 00:38:50,631
Let me help you.

630
00:39:53,127 --> 00:39:55,563
- Sir?
- What?

631
00:39:55,596 --> 00:39:57,765
- Sir, have you
been drinking tonight?

632
00:39:57,798 --> 00:39:59,133
- What, no.

633
00:39:59,166 --> 00:40:00,034
Fuck off.

634
00:40:01,702 --> 00:40:02,570
- Sir.

635
00:40:03,638 --> 00:40:06,073
- I just told you to fuck, ow,

636
00:40:06,107 --> 00:40:08,542
Jesus fuck.

637
00:40:08,576 --> 00:40:09,810
What the fuck?

638
00:40:10,611 --> 00:40:11,612
- I'll
ask you again, sir.

639
00:40:11,646 --> 00:40:13,514
Have you been drinking tonight?

640
00:40:13,547 --> 00:40:14,515
- No.

641
00:40:14,548 --> 00:40:15,950
I,

642
00:40:15,983 --> 00:40:18,152
I don't, I don't drink

643
00:40:18,185 --> 00:40:18,986
ever.

644
00:40:19,020 --> 00:40:20,788
I'm,

645
00:40:20,821 --> 00:40:23,991
I'm not gonna be someone's funny
little drunk fucking dwarf.

646
00:40:25,059 --> 00:40:25,960
- Right?

647
00:40:27,194 --> 00:40:29,730
Sir, I'm gonna have to ask you
to step out of the vehicle.

648
00:40:30,965 --> 00:40:31,766
- Are you kidding?

649
00:40:31,799 --> 00:40:33,734
- Step
out of the car, sir.

650
00:40:39,507 --> 00:40:40,274
- Winona.

651
00:40:40,308 --> 00:40:41,909
- Stop
touching the woman

652
00:40:41,943 --> 00:40:42,710
and step out of the car

653
00:40:42,743 --> 00:40:45,046
or I will have to
radio for backup.

654
00:40:50,918 --> 00:40:51,919
- This is bullshit.

655
00:40:52,820 --> 00:40:54,555
This is so fucking bullshit.

656
00:40:57,224 --> 00:40:58,526
Okay, I'm out.

657
00:40:59,527 --> 00:41:00,227
I'm out.

658
00:41:00,261 --> 00:41:01,028
- Sir,
are you familiar

659
00:41:01,062 --> 00:41:04,131
with intergalactic
ordinance L17?

660
00:41:05,132 --> 00:41:08,169
- Intergalactic what?

661
00:41:08,202 --> 00:41:09,303
- Sir,
the ordinance states

662
00:41:09,337 --> 00:41:12,006
any species with a class
three civilization or higher,

663
00:41:12,039 --> 00:41:13,641
that includes you, sir.

664
00:41:13,674 --> 00:41:14,342
Will be held accountable--

665
00:41:14,375 --> 00:41:15,142
- Wait, wait, wait, wait, no.

666
00:41:15,176 --> 00:41:17,144
- Planetary--
- No, I, I didn't,

667
00:41:17,178 --> 00:41:19,080
I didn't, I didn't do anything.

668
00:41:19,981 --> 00:41:21,549
- Sir, are
you or are you not

669
00:41:21,582 --> 00:41:24,552
a self-identified human being?

670
00:41:24,585 --> 00:41:25,419
- Yes.

671
00:41:25,453 --> 00:41:27,121
- And
this is your planet?

672
00:41:28,656 --> 00:41:29,757
- Okay, no, I
listen, I need to--

673
00:41:29,790 --> 00:41:30,658
- Oh, hey, easy there.

674
00:41:30,691 --> 00:41:31,759
Step back toward the car.

675
00:41:31,792 --> 00:41:33,127
Step back now.

676
00:41:36,630 --> 00:41:37,264
- Okay.

677
00:41:39,967 --> 00:41:40,801
- Sir,
I'm gonna need you

678
00:41:40,835 --> 00:41:43,537
to remove your
articles of clothing.

679
00:41:45,606 --> 00:41:47,008
- What?

680
00:41:47,041 --> 00:41:48,142
- Sir?
- Why?

681
00:41:48,175 --> 00:41:49,610
- I'm
not gonna repeat.

682
00:41:49,643 --> 00:41:50,244
- No, okay.

683
00:41:50,277 --> 00:41:51,178
Okay, I'm.

684
00:41:52,646 --> 00:41:53,814
Fine, I just.

685
00:42:18,873 --> 00:42:20,674
Why aren't you wearing a shirt?

686
00:42:20,708 --> 00:42:21,709
- Sir,
are you familiar

687
00:42:21,742 --> 00:42:24,178
with the name Shay Alvarez?

688
00:42:27,748 --> 00:42:29,683
Are you aware of what
befell Ms. Alvarez

689
00:42:29,717 --> 00:42:31,185
in August of last year?

690
00:42:33,387 --> 00:42:34,455
At that time,

691
00:42:34,488 --> 00:42:38,592
did Shay suffer from mental
illness or depression?

692
00:42:40,928 --> 00:42:42,229
- She,

693
00:42:43,931 --> 00:42:45,733
she was in constant pain, but

694
00:42:47,134 --> 00:42:49,070
it can be depressing.

695
00:42:57,978 --> 00:42:59,180
- The skin too.

696
00:43:03,651 --> 00:43:04,351
Now.

697
00:43:12,159 --> 00:43:13,194
- Ow.

698
00:43:16,130 --> 00:43:17,398
I'm sorry, I can't do it.

699
00:43:17,431 --> 00:43:18,165
- Are you trying
to cause trouble, sir?

700
00:43:18,199 --> 00:43:19,366
- No, I.

701
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:20,901
- Am I gonna need
to confiscate this vehicle?

702
00:43:20,935 --> 00:43:23,637
- No, no, no, no.

703
00:43:23,671 --> 00:43:25,139
Don't take her car.

704
00:43:25,172 --> 00:43:26,240
Don't touch her car.

705
00:43:26,273 --> 00:43:27,074
Don't.

706
00:43:27,108 --> 00:43:28,142
Please,

707
00:43:28,776 --> 00:43:29,877
please.

708
00:43:29,910 --> 00:43:31,879
- Sir, do you
recall exactly what happened

709
00:43:31,912 --> 00:43:34,081
the night your
friend passed away?

710
00:43:34,115 --> 00:43:35,216
- Yes.

711
00:43:35,783 --> 00:43:36,717
Yes, she,

712
00:43:38,352 --> 00:43:42,022
she called me on the phone and

713
00:43:43,090 --> 00:43:46,060
she told me that she was
hurting worse than she ever had.

714
00:43:49,730 --> 00:43:51,732
- And what
did you say to her?

715
00:43:52,700 --> 00:43:53,734
- I said,

716
00:44:00,141 --> 00:44:01,876
go back to sleep.

717
00:44:05,813 --> 00:44:10,384
It was late and I, I was
tired and I, I didn't know.

718
00:44:10,417 --> 00:44:12,086
I didn't know.

719
00:44:13,888 --> 00:44:15,890
- Sir, I'm gonna have
to ask you to come with me.

720
00:44:15,923 --> 00:44:16,724
- No.

721
00:44:16,757 --> 00:44:17,358
No.

722
00:44:17,391 --> 00:44:18,692
Fuck you.

723
00:46:11,872 --> 00:46:12,507
- Shit.

724
00:46:48,142 --> 00:46:49,109
Morning.

725
00:46:50,612 --> 00:46:51,445
- Is it?

726
00:46:57,519 --> 00:46:58,952
Hey are you all right?

727
00:46:59,887 --> 00:47:00,622
- Hmm, huh?

728
00:47:00,655 --> 00:47:01,589
Let's go.

729
00:47:01,623 --> 00:47:03,625
- Okay, can I pee?

730
00:47:03,658 --> 00:47:04,491
Please?

731
00:47:16,337 --> 00:47:17,639
- Hey, you know,

732
00:47:17,672 --> 00:47:20,407
later I thought maybe
I could read your book.

733
00:47:20,441 --> 00:47:21,576
- Don't bother.

734
00:47:21,609 --> 00:47:22,943
You wouldn't get it.

735
00:47:22,976 --> 00:47:23,877
- Says who?

736
00:47:23,911 --> 00:47:25,513
- Says me, the expert.

737
00:47:28,082 --> 00:47:29,517
How do I say this?

738
00:47:29,551 --> 00:47:31,452
Anton Chekhov

739
00:47:31,485 --> 00:47:34,254
is the greatest writer
who ever lived period.

740
00:47:35,489 --> 00:47:37,891
Next to him, Bill Shakespeare
looks like a second string

741
00:47:37,925 --> 00:47:39,527
little frilly collared bitch.

742
00:47:41,629 --> 00:47:43,397
- I almost admire your

743
00:47:43,430 --> 00:47:45,032
confidence of your own opinions.

744
00:47:49,169 --> 00:47:50,871
- This, oh fuck.

745
00:47:51,972 --> 00:47:52,973
Fuck.

746
00:47:53,006 --> 00:47:54,174
Fucking back.

747
00:47:54,208 --> 00:47:56,009
- You should be careful.

748
00:47:56,043 --> 00:47:58,379
- Careful fucking of what?

749
00:48:01,148 --> 00:48:02,483
- Dunno just, just careful.

750
00:48:04,485 --> 00:48:06,253
- Careful.

751
00:48:06,286 --> 00:48:07,287
Careful, she says.

752
00:48:07,321 --> 00:48:08,155
Just careful.

753
00:48:21,368 --> 00:48:23,571
Winona.
- It won't start.

754
00:48:26,273 --> 00:48:27,575
The fuck, won't start.

755
00:48:28,710 --> 00:48:29,611
It won't--

756
00:48:29,644 --> 00:48:30,310
- Wait, wait.

757
00:48:30,344 --> 00:48:31,211
Just wait a second.
- No.

758
00:48:31,245 --> 00:48:32,946
- Wait a second.
- You hold on a second.

759
00:48:32,980 --> 00:48:34,415
- Wait, wait.

760
00:48:34,448 --> 00:48:35,482
Jesus.

761
00:48:44,559 --> 00:48:45,593
- Oh.

762
00:48:56,036 --> 00:48:57,438
- You're a people person, right?

763
00:49:00,340 --> 00:49:01,543
- Hey, hi.

764
00:49:01,576 --> 00:49:02,577
Hello.

765
00:49:02,610 --> 00:49:03,243
Hello.

766
00:49:04,512 --> 00:49:06,548
Fuck, this is taking too long.

767
00:49:06,581 --> 00:49:08,449
- How about you flash your tits?

768
00:49:08,482 --> 00:49:10,284
- How about you flash your tits?

769
00:49:12,352 --> 00:49:14,689
- Hey, no, no, I
was, I was kidding.

770
00:49:14,722 --> 00:49:16,957
- Even a broken asshole's
right twice a day.

771
00:49:22,664 --> 00:49:24,331
Hi, hi, hi, hi.

772
00:49:24,364 --> 00:49:25,199
Hey.

773
00:49:25,232 --> 00:49:26,333
SOS, hello.

774
00:49:26,366 --> 00:49:27,167
- Hi, can you--
- Hi.

775
00:49:27,201 --> 00:49:28,469
- Help.

776
00:49:28,502 --> 00:49:30,070
- Yes.

777
00:49:30,103 --> 00:49:32,005
Yes.
- Should I say something?

778
00:49:32,039 --> 00:49:32,507
- Depends.

779
00:49:32,540 --> 00:49:33,575
- Depends on what?

780
00:49:33,608 --> 00:49:35,375
- On if your
entire personality changes

781
00:49:35,409 --> 00:49:36,644
in the next 15 seconds.

782
00:49:50,390 --> 00:49:52,392
- Having a bit of
car trouble, eh?

783
00:49:52,426 --> 00:49:53,260
- Yeah.

784
00:49:53,293 --> 00:49:55,429
Yeah, we, we were
just hoping you guys

785
00:49:55,462 --> 00:49:57,297
could give us a
super quick jump.

786
00:49:57,331 --> 00:49:58,198
- Oh, yeah.

787
00:49:58,232 --> 00:49:59,099
What's the kerfuffle?

788
00:49:59,132 --> 00:50:00,535
- Nothing, they just
need a quick jump.

789
00:50:00,568 --> 00:50:02,604
- We'd so,
so appreciate it.

790
00:50:04,438 --> 00:50:07,374
- Oh, I'm, I'm Lola
Nelson, by the way.

791
00:50:07,407 --> 00:50:10,310
And the space lady is Sadie.

792
00:50:21,455 --> 00:50:23,423
- Oh, I just
love your outfit.

793
00:50:23,457 --> 00:50:24,526
It's so shiny.

794
00:50:24,559 --> 00:50:26,426
- I know, right?

795
00:50:26,460 --> 00:50:27,394
Oh, check this out.

796
00:50:30,163 --> 00:50:31,198
- Fuck.

797
00:50:31,231 --> 00:50:32,534
- Whoa.

798
00:50:32,567 --> 00:50:33,701
Easy.

799
00:50:33,735 --> 00:50:35,502
The head and the
suit and everything,

800
00:50:35,537 --> 00:50:37,705
it's all just for
characters from Galaxy X.

801
00:50:39,106 --> 00:50:40,708
- What, what is that,
a Canadian thing?

802
00:50:40,742 --> 00:50:41,843
- Sort of.

803
00:50:41,876 --> 00:50:45,312
Like the OG manga and anime
are obviously Japanese,

804
00:50:45,345 --> 00:50:46,848
but they shoot the
TV show in Vancouver.

805
00:50:46,881 --> 00:50:49,551
- Oh, they, they shot the
second season in the Ukraine.

806
00:50:49,584 --> 00:50:50,518
- Sorry.

807
00:50:50,552 --> 00:50:52,754
They shot the second
season in the Ukraine.

808
00:50:52,787 --> 00:50:53,788
Thank you Lola,

809
00:50:53,821 --> 00:50:56,156
for correcting me about
something so important

810
00:50:56,189 --> 00:50:57,725
in front of these
people that we just met.

811
00:50:57,759 --> 00:50:59,627
- You're so welcome.

812
00:51:00,360 --> 00:51:02,597
- Uh-huh, ah, just

813
00:51:02,630 --> 00:51:04,566
with the cables, we're just
kind of, we're on a timeline.

814
00:51:04,599 --> 00:51:06,701
- All the big cons got
canceled this summer.

815
00:51:06,734 --> 00:51:08,435
So I begged and I borrowed,

816
00:51:08,468 --> 00:51:09,604
and I got down on my knees

817
00:51:09,637 --> 00:51:12,640
until Lola agreed to do this
road trip with me instead.

818
00:51:12,674 --> 00:51:13,775
- We drove up from
Toronto yesterday.

819
00:51:13,808 --> 00:51:14,742
- Yeah.

820
00:51:14,776 --> 00:51:17,110
We listened to like
six hours of podcasts

821
00:51:17,144 --> 00:51:18,846
about dead people
nobody's ever heard of.

822
00:51:18,880 --> 00:51:20,548
- Just that you've
never heard of.

823
00:51:20,582 --> 00:51:23,417
- And it's so great
that you guys do that together.

824
00:51:23,450 --> 00:51:25,152
- Oh, I love cosplay.

825
00:51:25,185 --> 00:51:26,219
But to do it full-time,

826
00:51:26,253 --> 00:51:28,723
you also have to do all
the shitty gross stuff.

827
00:51:28,756 --> 00:51:31,458
You know, like, even the top,

828
00:51:31,491 --> 00:51:33,728
top girls still do
things like Only Fans

829
00:51:33,761 --> 00:51:35,730
and sell nudes and stuff.

830
00:51:35,763 --> 00:51:39,634
And it's just like, have
some self-respect, you know?

831
00:51:39,667 --> 00:51:41,435
- Yeah.

832
00:51:41,468 --> 00:51:43,136
Yeah, totally.

833
00:51:43,170 --> 00:51:45,607
- I mean,
fuck that though.

834
00:51:45,640 --> 00:51:47,307
- Excuse me?

835
00:51:47,341 --> 00:51:49,142
- I said, fuck self-respect.

836
00:51:50,444 --> 00:51:51,679
You can't eat it.

837
00:51:51,713 --> 00:51:52,513
You can't sell it.

838
00:51:52,547 --> 00:51:53,514
And you know,

839
00:51:53,548 --> 00:51:54,682
it only matters if

840
00:51:54,716 --> 00:51:56,416
you decide it matters
to other people

841
00:51:56,450 --> 00:51:57,585
because of whatever dumb thing.

842
00:51:57,619 --> 00:51:58,418
So,

843
00:52:00,487 --> 00:52:01,421
fuck that.

844
00:52:04,626 --> 00:52:06,193
And let them sell
pictures of their feet

845
00:52:06,226 --> 00:52:07,361
to creeps in peace.

846
00:52:10,531 --> 00:52:11,799
Anyway, that's one opinion.

847
00:52:13,801 --> 00:52:14,702
- Yeah, I mean,

848
00:52:14,736 --> 00:52:17,939
I also have my opinion
as a professional.

849
00:52:17,972 --> 00:52:18,906
- Well, okay, cool.

850
00:52:18,940 --> 00:52:23,176
So, whose Chekhov is
in the passenger seat?

851
00:52:23,210 --> 00:52:24,679
- Oh, oh me, mine.

852
00:52:24,712 --> 00:52:26,714
- Oh, remember

853
00:52:26,748 --> 00:52:27,548
from the podcast?

854
00:52:27,582 --> 00:52:28,616
How could I forget?

855
00:52:28,650 --> 00:52:30,183
- I actually studied
him, or, I mean,

856
00:52:30,217 --> 00:52:32,820
I wrote my thesis
on his nonfiction.

857
00:52:32,854 --> 00:52:34,689
- Honestly, I don't know
how you could do that

858
00:52:34,722 --> 00:52:36,256
without killing yourself.

859
00:52:36,289 --> 00:52:38,693
The podcast made
him sound so sad.

860
00:52:38,726 --> 00:52:39,761
- Sad?

861
00:52:40,695 --> 00:52:42,764
Sad is the understatement
of the millennia.

862
00:52:42,797 --> 00:52:44,398
His characters aren't sad.

863
00:52:44,431 --> 00:52:45,265
They're,

864
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:47,200
they're tragic.

865
00:52:47,234 --> 00:52:47,835
- Yeah.

866
00:52:47,869 --> 00:52:48,770
Yes.

867
00:52:48,803 --> 00:52:50,738
I mean, the, the sad part,

868
00:52:50,772 --> 00:52:53,608
like the actually sad
part is that these people,

869
00:52:54,709 --> 00:52:57,377
they have their heads so
far up their own asses

870
00:52:57,411 --> 00:52:59,547
that they can't
take 'em out in time

871
00:52:59,580 --> 00:53:01,549
to unfuck their own lives.

872
00:53:05,720 --> 00:53:10,390
- So what's the ETA on the car?

873
00:53:10,424 --> 00:53:11,559
- Oh, yeah, sorry.

874
00:53:12,760 --> 00:53:14,696
- Just rev it up again.
- Uh-huh.

875
00:53:14,729 --> 00:53:16,363
And actually you should
start your engine.

876
00:53:16,396 --> 00:53:17,565
- Okay.

877
00:53:25,840 --> 00:53:27,274
- Hey, yeah.

878
00:53:27,307 --> 00:53:28,910
There we go.

879
00:53:28,943 --> 00:53:30,578
Jesus Murphy.

880
00:53:30,611 --> 00:53:32,847
Hey, you know, you
should be a mechanic.

881
00:53:32,880 --> 00:53:36,718
- Hey, any chance that you
wanna be an Ewok for me,

882
00:53:36,751 --> 00:53:39,821
you know, with like a big
furry hood and a mask?

883
00:53:39,854 --> 00:53:40,855
- I'll pass.

884
00:53:40,888 --> 00:53:42,523
- He passes.

885
00:53:42,557 --> 00:53:43,558
- Heard him.

886
00:53:44,892 --> 00:53:46,293
- Thanks guys.

887
00:53:46,326 --> 00:53:47,729
- All right.

888
00:53:47,762 --> 00:53:48,730
See you around.

889
00:53:48,763 --> 00:53:49,864
- Thank you.

890
00:53:49,897 --> 00:53:51,398
- Happy light reading.

891
00:53:53,366 --> 00:53:55,737
- And hey, you got to
talk about your guy.

892
00:53:57,437 --> 00:53:58,305
That was nice.

893
00:54:00,608 --> 00:54:01,441
Peter?
-Uh?

894
00:54:02,375 --> 00:54:03,978
You just, you weren't
there for a second.

895
00:54:04,011 --> 00:54:04,846
Like you.

896
00:54:08,049 --> 00:54:09,550
Oh my God.

897
00:54:10,752 --> 00:54:12,954
How could you forget
something like this?

898
00:54:12,987 --> 00:54:14,789
I mean, what should we do?

899
00:54:14,822 --> 00:54:16,423
Should we just leave it here

900
00:54:16,456 --> 00:54:17,525
in case they come back?

901
00:54:17,558 --> 00:54:18,391
Peter,

902
00:54:19,627 --> 00:54:20,862
what do you wanna do?

903
00:54:22,697 --> 00:54:23,898
- Let's drive.

904
00:56:05,666 --> 00:56:07,001
So what's the
intersection gonna look like

905
00:56:07,034 --> 00:56:08,569
when it happens?

906
00:56:08,603 --> 00:56:12,039
I wanna mentally and
emotionally prepare myself.

907
00:56:16,744 --> 00:56:18,012
- Well,

908
00:56:18,045 --> 00:56:19,046
I mean, whatever happens,

909
00:56:19,080 --> 00:56:21,849
it's not gonna be how
you imagine from a movie.

910
00:56:22,750 --> 00:56:23,751
- Why not?

911
00:56:23,784 --> 00:56:26,888
- The bridge people can
manipulate our reality

912
00:56:26,921 --> 00:56:29,624
and our perception
of our reality

913
00:56:29,657 --> 00:56:30,791
however they want

914
00:56:30,825 --> 00:56:33,594
in ways we literally
cannot perceive.

915
00:56:56,884 --> 00:56:58,686
- Gonna make
your intersection?

916
00:56:58,719 --> 00:56:59,854
- Yeah.

917
00:56:59,887 --> 00:57:01,923
We're ahead of
schedule actually.

918
00:57:01,956 --> 00:57:02,556
- No.

919
00:57:02,590 --> 00:57:03,925
How is that even possible?

920
00:57:03,958 --> 00:57:04,792
Hey.

921
00:57:08,629 --> 00:57:09,462
- I don't know.

922
00:57:18,072 --> 00:57:19,874
Maybe we drove through a portal.

923
00:57:21,208 --> 00:57:22,710
- Or a black hole.

924
00:57:23,678 --> 00:57:24,312
- Nah,

925
00:57:25,746 --> 00:57:27,447
we would've been spaghetti-fied.

926
00:57:29,050 --> 00:57:31,052
And the entire
planet would be gone.

927
00:57:33,654 --> 00:57:34,722
- I'm still here.

928
00:57:36,824 --> 00:57:37,658
- Still here.

929
00:59:21,362 --> 00:59:24,331
- This is my favorite
way to look at the world.

930
00:59:24,365 --> 00:59:26,600
You spy someone's little
light on somewhere.

931
00:59:26,634 --> 00:59:30,237
Or maybe it's just
a television screen,

932
00:59:31,105 --> 00:59:33,007
but your brain
fills in the blank.

933
00:59:34,809 --> 00:59:38,679
- I look through
people's windows sometimes

934
00:59:39,814 --> 00:59:40,948
back in my apartment,

935
00:59:42,116 --> 00:59:43,284
just across the courtyard.

936
00:59:43,317 --> 00:59:46,153
Not like going out
of my way to, anyway.

937
00:59:47,254 --> 00:59:49,223
If I look up and
I see something,

938
00:59:49,256 --> 00:59:53,027
then sometimes
I'll keep looking.

939
00:59:54,195 --> 00:59:55,963
- Why would you do it?

940
00:59:56,831 --> 00:59:58,299
- The same
reason people watch TV

941
00:59:58,332 --> 01:00:00,601
and read interviews
with strangers.

942
01:00:02,002 --> 01:00:04,071
The dream of
another, better life.

943
01:00:57,725 --> 01:00:58,359
- Peter.

944
01:01:00,327 --> 01:01:01,162
Peter.

945
01:01:02,830 --> 01:01:04,165
Come on, let's hit the hay.

946
01:01:05,099 --> 01:01:06,333
- Go on, I'm just gonna.

947
01:01:06,367 --> 01:01:07,201
- Peter.

948
01:01:12,873 --> 01:01:14,175
- I would enjoy a shower.

949
01:01:16,210 --> 01:01:18,112
- Honey, you need a shower.

950
01:01:18,145 --> 01:01:19,180
- Do I?

951
01:01:20,114 --> 01:01:22,116
- Yeah, you're nasty.

952
01:01:22,149 --> 01:01:24,418
- Oh, I'm nasty?
- Nast, nasty.

953
01:01:27,221 --> 01:01:29,256
You nasty, nasty.

954
01:01:29,290 --> 01:01:30,724
- I'm nasty.
- Yeah.

955
01:01:33,127 --> 01:01:33,961
Come on.

956
01:02:36,290 --> 01:02:37,358
- Hey, you know, I,

957
01:02:38,526 --> 01:02:39,893
I am thirsty.

958
01:02:40,828 --> 01:02:42,329
- I got ice from the machine.

959
01:02:42,363 --> 01:02:44,298
- No, I just, I don't
know, I don't know.

960
01:02:46,267 --> 01:02:47,535
You wanna go grab a beer?

961
01:02:49,303 --> 01:02:50,304
- Grab what?

962
01:02:51,272 --> 01:02:52,940
- I don't know, I just.

963
01:02:52,973 --> 01:02:53,807
Yes?

964
01:02:55,042 --> 01:02:55,943
- You don't drink.

965
01:02:55,976 --> 01:02:56,810
- No, I,

966
01:02:57,878 --> 01:02:59,079
thank you, yes, I know.

967
01:02:59,113 --> 01:03:01,949
But I, I mean, I
don't want any liquor.

968
01:03:01,982 --> 01:03:03,350
I just, I don't,

969
01:03:05,252 --> 01:03:07,121
I just wanna be around people

970
01:03:07,154 --> 01:03:08,956
like, you know, like,
maybe, I don't know,

971
01:03:08,989 --> 01:03:09,990
like maybe at that,

972
01:03:10,024 --> 01:03:12,393
whatever that place is
across the road, maybe.

973
01:03:12,426 --> 01:03:14,194
- You wanna be around people?

974
01:03:14,228 --> 01:03:16,230
- Well, six feet apart.

975
01:03:16,263 --> 01:03:17,197
- Is that why you're
dressed so nice?

976
01:03:17,231 --> 01:03:18,232
- But,

977
01:03:20,501 --> 01:03:21,536
yes.

978
01:03:23,137 --> 01:03:24,038
Yes.

979
01:03:25,272 --> 01:03:26,541
People, uh-huh.

980
01:03:27,875 --> 01:03:28,876
Uh-huh.

981
01:03:31,345 --> 01:03:33,280
- Peter, I'm like half asleep.

982
01:03:33,314 --> 01:03:36,250
- Well, hey, hey,
hey, hey, no, no.

983
01:03:36,283 --> 01:03:37,318
Winona.

984
01:03:38,152 --> 01:03:39,086
Listen.

985
01:03:39,119 --> 01:03:41,188
Do you really wanna
spend your last night

986
01:03:41,221 --> 01:03:43,824
on the planet Earth
lying in your bed?

987
01:03:49,363 --> 01:03:50,364
- No.

988
01:03:50,397 --> 01:03:51,432
- There we go.

989
01:03:51,465 --> 01:03:53,033
Yes.

990
01:03:53,067 --> 01:03:55,035
Yes, just, just,

991
01:03:55,069 --> 01:03:57,104
let's just go have a drink.

992
01:03:57,137 --> 01:04:00,374
One quick drink, and then you
know, it's back to Chekhov.

993
01:04:00,407 --> 01:04:01,509
- Okay, fine.

994
01:04:02,476 --> 01:04:04,411
Let me just put my face on.

995
01:04:04,445 --> 01:04:07,147
- Oh, no, no, just
wear the, wear the mask.

996
01:04:07,181 --> 01:04:10,117
- Wait, why don't you
just go ahead without me.

997
01:04:10,150 --> 01:04:10,984
Grab me a beer.

998
01:04:12,386 --> 01:04:13,555
- Thank you.
- Oh no.

999
01:04:13,588 --> 01:04:15,489
Actually get me a vodka tonic.

1000
01:04:15,523 --> 01:04:17,391
- Oh, a vodka tonic.

1001
01:04:17,424 --> 01:04:18,125
- Yeah.

1002
01:04:19,293 --> 01:04:22,930
- Okay, miss vodka tonic, okay.

1003
01:04:22,963 --> 01:04:24,064
Okay, let me just.

1004
01:04:27,468 --> 01:04:28,636
Fuck.

1005
01:04:28,670 --> 01:04:30,270
Hotel mirrors.

1006
01:04:30,304 --> 01:04:31,405
God, do I look okay?

1007
01:04:31,438 --> 01:04:33,340
Yeah, all right.

1008
01:04:33,374 --> 01:04:34,609
Okay, I'll see a minute.

1009
01:04:34,642 --> 01:04:36,910
- See you in a minute.
- Okay.

1010
01:04:36,944 --> 01:04:38,278
- Just be careful.

1011
01:04:41,949 --> 01:04:42,983
- Be careful of what?

1012
01:04:44,318 --> 01:04:45,953
- I don't know.

1013
01:04:45,986 --> 01:04:47,221
Crossing the road, just

1014
01:04:48,422 --> 01:04:49,456
be careful.

1015
01:04:52,292 --> 01:04:53,127
- All right then.

1016
01:04:55,329 --> 01:04:56,130
- See ya.

1017
01:04:56,163 --> 01:04:56,997
- Un minuto.

1018
01:04:58,198 --> 01:04:58,833
Cheers.

1019
01:05:23,190 --> 01:05:23,691
- Hi.

1020
01:05:23,725 --> 01:05:24,726
One vodka tonic.

1021
01:05:24,759 --> 01:05:26,594
And let's do that with
your second nicest vodka.

1022
01:05:26,628 --> 01:05:29,631
And then I'll also take
a Diet Coke with no ice.

1023
01:05:29,664 --> 01:05:30,565
Seriously, no ice.

1024
01:05:41,041 --> 01:05:42,409
- Thank you, thank you.

1025
01:05:49,383 --> 01:05:51,084
- Why
only second best?

1026
01:05:53,220 --> 01:05:53,855
- Sorry.

1027
01:05:57,725 --> 01:05:59,193
So, I'm sorry, what did you say?

1028
01:05:59,226 --> 01:06:00,360
What did you say?

1029
01:06:00,394 --> 01:06:01,395
- You asked her to pour you

1030
01:06:01,428 --> 01:06:03,163
the second nicest
vodka they had.

1031
01:06:04,331 --> 01:06:05,667
I was pondering at that point,

1032
01:06:06,601 --> 01:06:08,168
why spare the expense.

1033
01:06:09,203 --> 01:06:10,237
- The best, or like the,

1034
01:06:10,270 --> 01:06:13,575
the most top shelf liquor
at your average bar is,

1035
01:06:15,442 --> 01:06:18,312
is always gonna have the
highest markup, as a rule.

1036
01:06:21,315 --> 01:06:23,016
- But it's still
the best in't it?

1037
01:06:24,184 --> 01:06:25,419
- Yeah.

1038
01:06:25,452 --> 01:06:27,120
Yeah, I guess it is.

1039
01:06:33,494 --> 01:06:34,729
- You're American.
- Mm.

1040
01:06:37,064 --> 01:06:39,266
And you're Canadian, eh?

1041
01:06:40,133 --> 01:06:40,768
- Born and bred.

1042
01:06:42,135 --> 01:06:43,671
Sorry about that.

1043
01:06:43,705 --> 01:06:45,138
- Oh, I was, so.

1044
01:06:49,209 --> 01:06:51,411
You must be sick to death
of all the, you know,

1045
01:06:51,445 --> 01:06:56,450
I mean, you do look a little
bit lumberjackie though.

1046
01:06:56,483 --> 01:06:58,520
It, it invites commentary.

1047
01:06:58,553 --> 01:06:59,219
- Right, sure,

1048
01:06:59,253 --> 01:07:00,588
yeah, I bring it upon myself.

1049
01:07:00,622 --> 01:07:02,155
- Yes or not.

1050
01:07:02,189 --> 01:07:03,525
I, I, ugh, I'm,

1051
01:07:04,458 --> 01:07:06,426
I'm, I'm so sorry, I'm sorry.

1052
01:07:10,665 --> 01:07:11,498
It's,

1053
01:07:14,301 --> 01:07:15,302
it's been a minute

1054
01:07:15,335 --> 01:07:19,406
since I've engaged in
any casual conversation

1055
01:07:19,439 --> 01:07:20,708
with a strange man.

1056
01:07:20,742 --> 01:07:21,543
Sorry.

1057
01:07:21,576 --> 01:07:23,343
I'm, I'm,

1058
01:07:23,377 --> 01:07:24,211
I'm rusty.

1059
01:07:25,713 --> 01:07:26,681
- Yeah, I can tell.

1060
01:07:27,715 --> 01:07:30,183
It's the real reason I'm
sitting so far, actually.

1061
01:07:30,217 --> 01:07:31,418
- Oh, it's
not the plague?

1062
01:07:31,451 --> 01:07:34,121
- Oh, no, this is much more of
a social distance, you know,

1063
01:07:34,154 --> 01:07:35,657
and a social distance.

1064
01:07:38,726 --> 01:07:40,595
Are you waiting on someone?

1065
01:07:40,628 --> 01:07:41,763
- She's late, I don't.

1066
01:07:42,362 --> 01:07:44,131
- Oh, she.

1067
01:07:44,164 --> 01:07:48,870
- Oh, long, long,
fucking long story.

1068
01:07:48,903 --> 01:07:51,238
That's story for another day.
- Yeah.

1069
01:07:52,172 --> 01:07:54,609
Just glad I wasn't totally
misreading the situation.

1070
01:07:56,176 --> 01:07:56,811
- Yeah,

1071
01:07:58,646 --> 01:07:59,681
no,

1072
01:08:01,348 --> 01:08:02,349
you are not.

1073
01:08:07,354 --> 01:08:09,657
- Do you want to dance with me?

1074
01:08:42,790 --> 01:08:45,325
- How'd you get this number?

1075
01:09:22,664 --> 01:09:23,665
- I,

1076
01:09:25,499 --> 01:09:28,201
I keep a picture of her

1077
01:09:28,235 --> 01:09:29,169
in my book.

1078
01:09:31,304 --> 01:09:32,507
I use it as a book mark

1079
01:09:35,442 --> 01:09:37,444
so she's always there, you know.

1080
01:09:38,946 --> 01:09:40,948
So she's always with me.

1081
01:09:42,617 --> 01:09:45,318
- I'm sorry to hear
about your friend.

1082
01:09:45,352 --> 01:09:47,220
That sounds like you're
a good friend to her.

1083
01:09:50,290 --> 01:09:51,324
- No.

1084
01:09:53,027 --> 01:09:54,662
- Oh, yeah.

1085
01:09:55,663 --> 01:09:56,998
I didn't say perfect.

1086
01:09:59,667 --> 01:10:01,268
I wish I could.

1087
01:10:02,804 --> 01:10:03,638
Right?

1088
01:10:04,772 --> 01:10:06,708
Good is good, you know,

1089
01:10:07,809 --> 01:10:09,744
good is all we can get.

1090
01:10:20,555 --> 01:10:21,789
- This is good.

1091
01:10:22,523 --> 01:10:23,624
- Good?

1092
01:10:26,994 --> 01:10:28,730
- This is perfect.

1093
01:10:37,437 --> 01:10:39,239
I'm going to her
beach tomorrow.

1094
01:10:40,541 --> 01:10:41,576
The one, she's,

1095
01:10:43,711 --> 01:10:46,246
the one she thought we
were gonna see together.

1096
01:10:47,648 --> 01:10:48,716
- Are you nervous?

1097
01:10:51,485 --> 01:10:52,620
- It's just sand,

1098
01:10:53,554 --> 01:10:54,387
water,

1099
01:10:55,790 --> 01:10:56,624
sky.

1100
01:11:00,995 --> 01:11:03,363
This is, this is good.

1101
01:11:04,732 --> 01:11:07,001
- Are you nervous?

1102
01:11:07,034 --> 01:11:08,903
- It's just sand,

1103
01:11:08,936 --> 01:11:10,571
water, sky.

1104
01:11:12,940 --> 01:11:13,741
- Are you nervous?

1105
01:11:13,775 --> 01:11:15,910
- It's just sand,

1106
01:11:15,943 --> 01:11:17,444
water.

1107
01:11:46,741 --> 01:11:49,710
I'm, I'm so sorry.

1108
01:11:49,744 --> 01:11:52,513
Did, you asked me, you
asked me something?

1109
01:11:52,547 --> 01:11:53,047
- Oh, no.

1110
01:11:53,080 --> 01:11:53,781
Fuck no.

1111
01:11:53,815 --> 01:11:54,816
It was, wasn't like a question.

1112
01:11:54,849 --> 01:11:56,651
It was just,

1113
01:11:56,684 --> 01:11:57,785
you know, you're American.

1114
01:11:59,120 --> 01:12:00,855
- Yes, oh.

1115
01:12:00,888 --> 01:12:02,824
And, and you are Canadian.

1116
01:12:03,423 --> 01:12:04,926
- Oh, well, shit obviously.

1117
01:12:07,094 --> 01:12:10,698
Hey, you know, and I hope
this is okay to say, right?

1118
01:12:10,731 --> 01:12:12,399
But I don't think
I've ever seen,

1119
01:12:13,835 --> 01:12:14,869
you know, like.

1120
01:12:15,970 --> 01:12:17,437
- What?

1121
01:12:17,470 --> 01:12:19,674
- You know, like, like,

1122
01:12:19,707 --> 01:12:21,742
a person, people
like, like you,

1123
01:12:21,776 --> 01:12:23,811
you know, like, like
in person, you know?

1124
01:12:25,478 --> 01:12:27,148
- Oh, yes.

1125
01:12:27,181 --> 01:12:29,083
We, yeah, we are
rare, rare birds.

1126
01:12:29,116 --> 01:12:30,450
- Uh-huh.

1127
01:12:31,451 --> 01:12:32,653
In a shit town like this,

1128
01:12:32,687 --> 01:12:34,755
you don't get too many fucking

1129
01:12:34,789 --> 01:12:35,890
dwarves or

1130
01:12:37,692 --> 01:12:40,427
whatever the right word is now.

1131
01:12:40,460 --> 01:12:41,095
- Little person.

1132
01:12:42,797 --> 01:12:43,764
- Little person.

1133
01:12:45,733 --> 01:12:46,601
Shit, sorry, man.

1134
01:12:46,634 --> 01:12:49,937
But that's way worse
than fucking dwarf

1135
01:12:49,971 --> 01:12:51,973
for a midget or whatever, fuck.

1136
01:12:58,012 --> 01:12:58,913
- It's the word.

1137
01:13:15,563 --> 01:13:17,899
Hey, I was, I was--
- What the fuck?!

1138
01:13:17,932 --> 01:13:18,966
- What?

1139
01:13:19,700 --> 01:13:21,936
No, I, I didn't.

1140
01:13:24,138 --> 01:13:26,107
- I'm not a fag.

1141
01:13:26,140 --> 01:13:27,942
- No.

1142
01:13:27,975 --> 01:13:28,809
No.

1143
01:13:30,177 --> 01:13:31,979
No, that's,

1144
01:13:32,013 --> 01:13:34,582
no, that's not
what I'm, I didn't.

1145
01:13:34,615 --> 01:13:35,750
No.

1146
01:14:33,274 --> 01:14:34,208
- One more.

1147
01:14:40,114 --> 01:14:40,948
Winona?

1148
01:14:43,651 --> 01:14:45,953
Hello, oh, fucking.

1149
01:14:49,256 --> 01:14:50,124
Winona.

1150
01:14:54,028 --> 01:14:56,764
Winona, open up, I need to pee.

1151
01:14:59,567 --> 01:15:00,968
Winona, open the,

1152
01:15:01,002 --> 01:15:02,169
open the fucking door.

1153
01:15:02,203 --> 01:15:03,771
I'm gonna piss my pants.

1154
01:15:03,804 --> 01:15:04,672
- Peter.

1155
01:15:06,607 --> 01:15:08,275
- Yes.

1156
01:15:08,309 --> 01:15:10,811
- Is anyone
out there with you?

1157
01:15:10,845 --> 01:15:12,013
- What?

1158
01:15:12,046 --> 01:15:12,780
No, just,

1159
01:15:14,015 --> 01:15:16,951
just come out and talk
like a normal person.

1160
01:15:18,085 --> 01:15:21,022
I already waited over there
for you for a fucking hour.

1161
01:15:22,957 --> 01:15:23,758
Thank you.

1162
01:15:24,792 --> 01:15:25,860
I just, fuck.

1163
01:15:26,794 --> 01:15:27,995
Unlock the door.

1164
01:15:29,130 --> 01:15:30,097
- If I come out,

1165
01:15:30,131 --> 01:15:31,932
do you promise that
there's no one else there

1166
01:15:31,966 --> 01:15:33,634
and that you
checked outside too?

1167
01:15:35,069 --> 01:15:36,037
- What?

1168
01:15:36,070 --> 01:15:37,071
Fucking.

1169
01:15:37,104 --> 01:15:38,205
All right, I'll check.

1170
01:15:40,374 --> 01:15:43,077
No, no one, it's just us.

1171
01:15:43,878 --> 01:15:44,845
Hey.

1172
01:15:44,879 --> 01:15:47,882
- Okay, step
back, I'm coming out.

1173
01:15:49,650 --> 01:15:51,652
- Hey, did you unlock the phone?

1174
01:15:51,685 --> 01:15:54,121
Hey, there she is.

1175
01:15:54,955 --> 01:15:57,792
Hey, were you just
in there all night?

1176
01:15:57,825 --> 01:15:59,927
We were gonna go have
a drink, remember?

1177
01:16:02,730 --> 01:16:04,965
Do you remember?
- Yes, yeah.

1178
01:16:04,999 --> 01:16:07,635
- So what the, what
the hell happened?

1179
01:16:11,005 --> 01:16:12,973
What happened Winona?

1180
01:16:13,007 --> 01:16:14,675
Hey did you,

1181
01:16:14,708 --> 01:16:17,111
did you unplug the phone?

1182
01:16:17,144 --> 01:16:18,345
Hey, stop it.

1183
01:16:18,379 --> 01:16:19,814
Winona.

1184
01:16:19,847 --> 01:16:20,981
Stop it.

1185
01:16:21,015 --> 01:16:21,816
Stop.

1186
01:16:21,849 --> 01:16:22,850
Stop it.

1187
01:16:28,222 --> 01:16:29,256
What are you doing?

1188
01:16:31,959 --> 01:16:34,095
- People
know that I'm here

1189
01:16:34,128 --> 01:16:37,398
and they're coming
to bring me back.

1190
01:16:37,431 --> 01:16:38,265
- You're not me.

1191
01:16:40,034 --> 01:16:43,070
You're not making, back, where?

1192
01:16:43,104 --> 01:16:44,105
Back where?

1193
01:16:44,138 --> 01:16:45,306
- To New York.

1194
01:16:50,144 --> 01:16:52,313
- Winona, okay,
just fucking sit.

1195
01:16:54,181 --> 01:16:54,949
Just sit down.

1196
01:16:54,982 --> 01:16:57,818
Just sit down.
- There's no time.

1197
01:16:57,852 --> 01:16:59,120
- Oh, why, why?

1198
01:16:59,153 --> 01:17:02,356
Because the magical aliens
will zap back into space

1199
01:17:02,389 --> 01:17:06,160
without you if you don't
get there at, what is it?

1200
01:17:06,193 --> 01:17:07,194
What is it?

1201
01:17:07,228 --> 01:17:08,095
Let me see.

1202
01:17:08,129 --> 01:17:10,364
50th two 54.

1203
01:17:10,397 --> 01:17:11,832
- That's
what they said.

1204
01:17:11,866 --> 01:17:13,067
- It's not real, Winona.

1205
01:17:13,100 --> 01:17:15,136
- Stop.
- It's not real.

1206
01:17:15,169 --> 01:17:16,837
- Stop it.
- And I'm so sorry

1207
01:17:16,871 --> 01:17:19,006
the universe doesn't work
like you want it to work.

1208
01:17:19,039 --> 01:17:20,374
But Winona,

1209
01:17:20,407 --> 01:17:22,042
Winona,

1210
01:17:22,076 --> 01:17:24,111
we get put in our bodies

1211
01:17:24,145 --> 01:17:25,379
in this place,

1212
01:17:26,080 --> 01:17:28,716
and we live and we die,

1213
01:17:28,749 --> 01:17:31,418
and we decompose here.

1214
01:17:31,452 --> 01:17:34,155
- Drunk, you're drunk.
- I'm not drunk.

1215
01:17:34,188 --> 01:17:35,022
I'm,

1216
01:17:36,157 --> 01:17:38,125
I'm fine, fine, I'm,

1217
01:17:38,159 --> 01:17:41,862
but that doesn't mean what
I'm saying isn't true.

1218
01:17:41,896 --> 01:17:42,730
This,

1219
01:17:43,464 --> 01:17:45,232
this world, this fucking,

1220
01:17:45,266 --> 01:17:47,134
the, the frame,

1221
01:17:47,168 --> 01:17:49,069
the, the, the, the,

1222
01:17:49,103 --> 01:17:50,204
the world.

1223
01:17:51,105 --> 01:17:52,740
It does

1224
01:17:52,773 --> 01:17:53,774
not

1225
01:17:53,807 --> 01:17:55,209
want us.

1226
01:17:55,242 --> 01:17:56,944
We do not fit.

1227
01:17:57,745 --> 01:17:59,346
We do not have a place

1228
01:17:59,380 --> 01:18:02,716
because we are mistakes.

1229
01:18:02,750 --> 01:18:03,384
- You.

1230
01:18:04,653 --> 01:18:07,221
All of your problems are just
things that you do to yourself

1231
01:18:07,254 --> 01:18:10,391
because you are a bitter
gutless, heartless little human.

1232
01:18:13,227 --> 01:18:14,328
- So I'm a little,

1233
01:18:14,361 --> 01:18:15,329
I'm a little.
- Yeah,

1234
01:18:15,362 --> 01:18:16,697
little, little, little.

1235
01:18:17,364 --> 01:18:18,332
You make rules

1236
01:18:18,365 --> 01:18:20,234
and then you get mad
when people break rules

1237
01:18:20,267 --> 01:18:21,235
and you pick fights,

1238
01:18:21,268 --> 01:18:24,471
and then you act like
you're being attacked.

1239
01:18:24,506 --> 01:18:28,309
And this fucking death wish,

1240
01:18:28,342 --> 01:18:30,077
horny for death bullshit.

1241
01:18:32,146 --> 01:18:34,381
You are unlovable, Peter,

1242
01:18:34,415 --> 01:18:37,184
because everything
that is in you is bad.

1243
01:18:39,954 --> 01:18:40,754
I'm leaving.

1244
01:18:44,858 --> 01:18:45,492
- Wonderful.

1245
01:18:46,460 --> 01:18:47,294
Perfect, that.

1246
01:18:51,098 --> 01:18:51,932
Go.

1247
01:18:51,966 --> 01:18:53,867
Just fucking get the
fuck out of here.

1248
01:18:53,901 --> 01:18:54,768
Go.

1249
01:18:54,802 --> 01:18:56,437
Keep pretending
there's something else

1250
01:18:56,470 --> 01:18:58,339
waiting somewhere.

1251
01:18:58,372 --> 01:19:00,140
Sorry you have to
hear this from a

1252
01:19:00,174 --> 01:19:03,077
fucked up little fag midget,

1253
01:19:03,110 --> 01:19:06,046
but actions have
consequences, you crazy bitch.

1254
01:19:20,494 --> 01:19:21,328
Winona.

1255
01:19:27,968 --> 01:19:29,003
Fuck you!

1256
01:19:32,006 --> 01:19:35,209
Dragging me across
the fucking continent.

1257
01:19:36,076 --> 01:19:37,311
What the shit!

1258
01:19:40,047 --> 01:19:42,249
I should be at home.

1259
01:19:42,283 --> 01:19:44,184
I should, I should be in bed.

1260
01:19:44,218 --> 01:19:46,153
I had a whole thing.

1261
01:19:46,186 --> 01:19:47,388
And you ruined it.

1262
01:19:48,322 --> 01:19:50,057
You ruined it.

1263
01:19:50,090 --> 01:19:52,293
You made me fucking, you.

1264
01:19:52,326 --> 01:19:53,927
Hey, Winona.

1265
01:19:56,397 --> 01:19:57,231
Winona.

1266
01:19:58,999 --> 01:19:59,833
Don't fuck.

1267
01:23:51,331 --> 01:23:53,333
You were right about me.

1268
01:23:57,437 --> 01:23:58,272
- What?

1269
01:24:01,441 --> 01:24:03,377
- You were right about

1270
01:24:04,879 --> 01:24:07,147
well, not everything, but

1271
01:24:08,783 --> 01:24:10,785
you were right about me.

1272
01:24:16,490 --> 01:24:18,258
You wanna stand up?

1273
01:24:24,331 --> 01:24:25,567
- I can't move.

1274
01:24:30,137 --> 01:24:31,305
- That's okay.

1275
01:24:32,840 --> 01:24:33,841
That's okay.

1276
01:24:45,218 --> 01:24:46,621
- It didn't happen.

1277
01:24:47,755 --> 01:24:48,590
- What?

1278
01:24:55,429 --> 01:24:56,564
- I came when they said,

1279
01:24:57,632 --> 01:24:58,800
46 minutes ago,

1280
01:25:01,703 --> 01:25:04,371
and I'm still here.

1281
01:25:10,945 --> 01:25:11,779
- I'm sorry.

1282
01:25:15,248 --> 01:25:16,383
- I'm sorry too.

1283
01:25:17,852 --> 01:25:19,887
I'm sorry I called
you what I called you.

1284
01:25:25,492 --> 01:25:26,694
- I called you worse.

1285
01:25:55,890 --> 01:25:59,761
- I have got terrible,
terrible corns.

1286
01:26:00,628 --> 01:26:01,696
Oh, geez.

1287
01:26:02,563 --> 01:26:03,430
- Excuse me?

1288
01:26:03,463 --> 01:26:06,668
- Corns on the
balls, of both my feet.

1289
01:26:08,502 --> 01:26:10,672
I say this by way of explanation

1290
01:26:10,705 --> 01:26:11,773
as to why

1291
01:26:12,774 --> 01:26:14,676
I am not standing up right now.

1292
01:26:14,709 --> 01:26:17,679
Why I sat down
instead of, you know,

1293
01:26:17,712 --> 01:26:20,480
addressing you face
to face, eye to eye.

1294
01:26:22,817 --> 01:26:24,184
Well, you beat us here.

1295
01:26:24,952 --> 01:26:26,788
Good on you for that.

1296
01:26:29,757 --> 01:26:33,226
You know, the two of
you together plus us,

1297
01:26:33,260 --> 01:26:33,961
that's makes a,

1298
01:26:35,697 --> 01:26:36,731
a seven.

1299
01:26:38,298 --> 01:26:39,634
- Seven what?

1300
01:26:43,638 --> 01:26:46,941
- Abigail, will you kindly.

1301
01:26:52,547 --> 01:26:55,016
- Fuck me with a rusty spoon.

1302
01:26:55,049 --> 01:26:57,518
- A rusty what
did, what did you?

1303
01:26:58,653 --> 01:27:00,253
- Fuck.

1304
01:27:00,287 --> 01:27:01,488
Fuck!

1305
01:27:01,522 --> 01:27:03,524
Fuck!

1306
01:27:03,558 --> 01:27:04,491
Winona, I.

1307
01:27:05,358 --> 01:27:06,627
- Hi.

1308
01:27:06,661 --> 01:27:08,763
- Oh, hi there, young lady.

1309
01:27:09,797 --> 01:27:11,398
- Hi.

1310
01:27:11,431 --> 01:27:12,432
I, I thought I,

1311
01:27:14,401 --> 01:27:15,536
I guess I, I didn't,

1312
01:27:15,570 --> 01:27:16,704
I didn't think you,

1313
01:27:16,738 --> 01:27:17,839
you're, you're still here.

1314
01:27:19,339 --> 01:27:21,976
- Well, now what
are your two names?

1315
01:27:23,410 --> 01:27:24,545
- Winona J.

1316
01:27:24,579 --> 01:27:25,513
J for Jordan.

1317
01:27:25,546 --> 01:27:26,814
- And I'm Sir Paul McCartney.

1318
01:27:28,415 --> 01:27:29,717
- Peter.
- Peter, yes.

1319
01:27:30,651 --> 01:27:31,786
Yes, my,

1320
01:27:31,819 --> 01:27:32,687
my name is Peter,

1321
01:27:33,755 --> 01:27:35,523
and I am not a part of this.

1322
01:27:36,524 --> 01:27:37,725
- Well, that's all right.

1323
01:27:38,626 --> 01:27:42,663
Abigail, how much
longer do we have?

1324
01:27:42,697 --> 01:27:44,431
- Three hours, 11 minutes.

1325
01:27:49,904 --> 01:27:51,706
- Three hours, 11 minutes?

1326
01:27:55,576 --> 01:27:56,778
I wrote it wrong.

1327
01:27:56,811 --> 01:28:01,414
- Whatever you did or you did
not do, Miss Winona Jordan,

1328
01:28:01,448 --> 01:28:04,384
I'm sure it came
from your heart.

1329
01:28:07,021 --> 01:28:09,824
- So, this has been fun.

1330
01:28:09,857 --> 01:28:10,892
Winona,

1331
01:28:16,898 --> 01:28:17,799
I guess this is

1332
01:28:19,366 --> 01:28:20,333
where I leave you.

1333
01:28:22,804 --> 01:28:24,806
- You can stay,
you can, I mean--

1334
01:28:24,839 --> 01:28:25,907
- What?

1335
01:28:25,940 --> 01:28:26,774
Go to,

1336
01:28:29,844 --> 01:28:32,379
that sounds very,
very appealing.

1337
01:28:34,982 --> 01:28:35,817
I mean it.

1338
01:28:38,853 --> 01:28:40,021
- Oh, oh, I,

1339
01:28:43,758 --> 01:28:45,793
for your trouble and your car.

1340
01:28:48,629 --> 01:28:49,730
- Thank you, thank you.

1341
01:28:49,764 --> 01:28:51,065
Well, it's, it's funny.

1342
01:28:51,098 --> 01:28:52,934
I mean, it's not
really funny, but I,

1343
01:28:53,835 --> 01:28:54,869
I almost,

1344
01:28:58,438 --> 01:28:59,774
thanks.

1345
01:29:04,477 --> 01:29:05,746
Uh-huh.

1346
01:29:07,782 --> 01:29:08,816
Well.

1347
01:29:12,553 --> 01:29:13,554
Yes.

1348
01:29:37,778 --> 01:29:38,613
- Peter.

1349
01:29:48,990 --> 01:29:50,490
Be careful.

1350
01:33:28,042 --> 01:33:31,779
- Wait, hey.

1351
01:33:35,883 --> 01:33:37,852
- Thank you, thank you.

1352
01:34:02,042 --> 01:34:04,111
- Dad, be careful.

1353
01:34:14,221 --> 01:34:16,323
- If you start at
that northeast corner

1354
01:34:16,357 --> 01:34:17,491
of those four stars,

1355
01:34:17,526 --> 01:34:21,962
that form a square, that's
the great square of Pegasus.

1356
01:34:21,996 --> 01:34:25,132
And the, you see the
coming off of it,

1357
01:34:25,166 --> 01:34:27,001
there's like a handle,

1358
01:34:27,034 --> 01:34:29,203
that's not even
our galaxy anymore.

1359
01:34:29,236 --> 01:34:30,704
That's Andromeda,

1360
01:34:30,738 --> 01:34:32,239
which is this
whole other galaxy.

1361
01:34:32,273 --> 01:34:35,910
It's 2.5 million
light years away.

1362
01:35:19,053 --> 01:35:19,987
Look, see.

1363
01:35:28,395 --> 01:35:29,863
You ever wake up from a dream

1364
01:35:29,897 --> 01:35:31,265
and it's like you're
still dreaming.

1365
01:35:37,905 --> 01:35:38,505
- Hello?
