00:04:34,439 --> 00:04:36,141

13
00:04:39,945 --> 00:04:40,980
Here, drink.

[groans]
Thank you, David.

15
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:49,821
- Have some more.
- I'm good. [clears throat]

16
00:04:49,854 --> 00:04:51,456
- I got it. It's good.
- Okay.

18
00:04:55,927 --> 00:04:58,062
You okay?

19
00:04:58,095 --> 00:05:02,934
No. I'm old, and I didn't
sign up for this crap.

20
00:05:05,136 --> 00:05:06,905
Are you trying
to get in shape?

21
00:05:06,938 --> 00:05:08,174
What?

22
00:05:09,140 --> 00:05:10,609
You out running?

23
00:05:10,641 --> 00:05:12,612
Oh, yeah,
just went for a jog.

24
00:05:14,011 --> 00:05:15,613
How far?

25
00:05:15,647 --> 00:05:17,016
I don't know.
I wasn't keeping track.

26
00:05:17,049 --> 00:05:19,118
Oh, come on, man.
I need stats.

27
00:05:20,184 --> 00:05:21,920
I wasn't keeping a tab
or anything, Dad.

28
00:05:21,953 --> 00:05:25,590
- Just trying to get the blood flowing.
- [coughing]

[splutters]

30
00:05:35,032 --> 00:05:36,869
Find my lung over there?

31
00:05:38,102 --> 00:05:39,972
You sure you're okay?

32
00:05:40,004 --> 00:05:42,106
Yeah, this just
comes and goes.

33
00:05:42,140 --> 00:05:44,543
All right. I'll see you
in a little bit, okay?

34
00:05:44,575 --> 00:05:45,878
All right.

35
00:05:45,910 --> 00:05:47,846
- You working?
- Yeah.

36
00:05:47,879 --> 00:05:50,081
I'm gonna go
by Mrs. Staples.

37
00:05:50,114 --> 00:05:51,684
Then I'm gonna run
to Fillmore.

38
00:05:51,717 --> 00:05:53,786
[Dad] You going to work now?

39
00:05:53,818 --> 00:05:55,987
[David] I'm just going
to run a quick errand.

40
00:05:56,020 --> 00:05:57,689
[Dad] This early?

41
00:05:59,624 --> 00:06:03,495
Yeah, Dad. This early.
Stop digging.

42
00:06:03,528 --> 00:06:06,164
[Dad] They got candy bars
wherever it is you're going?

43
00:06:06,198 --> 00:06:08,567
[David] I'm sure they do.

44
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:11,871
[Dad] Hey, I'll give you a dollar
if you'll pick one up for me.

45
00:06:11,903 --> 00:06:14,506
Candy bars cost a dollar, Dad.

46
00:06:14,539 --> 00:06:16,475
[Dad] Okay, I'll give you two.

47
00:06:17,676 --> 00:06:20,613
- You know what?
- No, I don't know what.

48
00:06:20,645 --> 00:06:23,883
You make dinner tonight,
we'll call it even. How's that sound?

49
00:06:23,915 --> 00:06:25,984
[Dad] Well, that sounds
like a good deal.

50
00:06:26,885 --> 00:06:28,721
- Hey, David?
- Yeah.

51
00:06:28,753 --> 00:06:30,289
[Dad] When you get
my candy bar,

52
00:06:30,321 --> 00:06:32,257
could you get some steaks
for dinner?

53
00:06:34,025 --> 00:06:37,062
- [switch clicks]
- Uh, so I'm getting...

54
00:06:39,730 --> 00:06:41,900
the dinner and the candy bar?

55
00:06:41,934 --> 00:06:45,737
[Dad] Yeah. You're a good son.
Almost my favorite.

56
00:06:45,770 --> 00:06:48,140
- Love you, Dad.
- [chuckles] See ya.

Hey, Dawnell.

[whistling]

69
00:10:19,283 --> 00:10:20,885
Good morning.

70
00:10:22,888 --> 00:10:24,190
Would you hit me?

71
00:10:25,422 --> 00:10:26,825
Thanks, brother.

72
00:10:33,565 --> 00:10:36,001
Can I get a splash of that,
too, when you're done?

73
00:10:36,033 --> 00:10:38,870
I'd really... I'd appreciate it, man.
Just, hands are full.

74
00:10:42,507 --> 00:10:45,077
That's good.
Hey, thanks again, man.

75
00:10:58,455 --> 00:11:00,124
Hey, David.

76
00:11:00,157 --> 00:11:01,859
How you doing, Jeremy?

77
00:11:01,893 --> 00:11:04,463
[no audible dialogue]

[engine idling]

87
00:13:34,546 --> 00:13:36,047
Sorry, boys.

88
00:13:37,081 --> 00:13:38,716
- [bicycle bell rings]
- [boy] Dad!

89
00:13:38,749 --> 00:13:42,253
[chuckles] Hey, Bug!

90
00:13:44,556 --> 00:13:47,025
- Missed you, man.
- Where were you?

91
00:13:47,057 --> 00:13:48,726
I'm sorry.
I had some work stuff.

92
00:13:48,759 --> 00:13:50,328
- Hey, Dad.
- Hey.

93
00:13:50,361 --> 00:13:51,996
Did you get doughnuts?

94
00:13:52,029 --> 00:13:54,198
Oh, I forgot.

95
00:13:54,231 --> 00:13:56,667
- Where's Jess?
- She took off with some friends.

96
00:13:56,700 --> 00:13:59,971
[woman] Theo! Honey,
you forgot your homework. Hey, David.

97
00:14:00,004 --> 00:14:02,374
- Sorry I'm late.
- No, no worries.

98
00:14:02,407 --> 00:14:05,076
That's okay.
Everything okay?

99
00:14:05,109 --> 00:14:07,311
- Yeah, just work stuff.
- Okay.

100
00:14:07,345 --> 00:14:09,380
All right, boys,
don't be late.

101
00:14:09,413 --> 00:14:11,249
[kisses] One more
and Principal Andrews

102
00:14:11,282 --> 00:14:13,317
is gonna make me meet him
and make a plan.

103
00:14:13,350 --> 00:14:15,753
You got some...
There you go. I love you.

104
00:14:15,787 --> 00:14:18,489
Hey, you guys go ahead.
I'm gonna talk to Mom for a minute, okay?

105
00:14:18,523 --> 00:14:19,657
- Okay.
- All right.

106
00:14:22,726 --> 00:14:24,762
- What's up?
- Oh, nothing.

107
00:14:24,796 --> 00:14:27,065
Just want to make sure we're
still good for Friday night.

108
00:14:27,098 --> 00:14:29,001
Yeah. Still work for you
or you got something?

109
00:14:29,033 --> 00:14:31,669
No, it's good. It's good.
I'm looking forward to it.

110
00:14:32,670 --> 00:14:34,239
Yeah, me too.

111
00:14:36,206 --> 00:14:38,210
The boys said
Jess took off. She okay?

112
00:14:39,043 --> 00:14:41,479
Just dealing with it all.

113
00:14:41,513 --> 00:14:43,749
I think this stuff
is harder on girls.

114
00:14:45,550 --> 00:14:49,621
- You think we're doing the right thing, Niki?
- David, I don't know.

115
00:14:49,653 --> 00:14:51,422
Look, the boys are
halfway to school.

116
00:14:51,455 --> 00:14:53,425
You with them is the most
important thing right now.

117
00:14:53,457 --> 00:14:55,659
- Right, right, I'm sorry. It's just...
- Don't be sorry.

118
00:14:55,692 --> 00:14:58,629
We're doing what we discussed and
thought was best, and we said we'd see.

119
00:14:58,662 --> 00:15:00,264
So we're seeing.

120
00:15:00,297 --> 00:15:02,299
[Bug] Dad!

121
00:15:02,332 --> 00:15:04,335
David, I love you,
you love me.

122
00:15:04,369 --> 00:15:06,604
We're trying
to figure this out.

123
00:15:06,638 --> 00:15:08,507
We can't analyze
every step,

124
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:11,176
and if the boys walk themselves to
school, that's on you.

125
00:15:20,384 --> 00:15:22,053
- Hey, Alex.
- Yeah?

126
00:15:22,086 --> 00:15:25,056
- What do you call a pile of kittens?
- What?

127
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:26,458
A meow-tain.

128
00:15:26,490 --> 00:15:28,559
- Aw, Dad!
- Meow-tain.

129
00:15:28,593 --> 00:15:30,162
- Dad.
- Come on.

130
00:15:30,195 --> 00:15:32,763
- That is terrible.
- I want new jokes.

131
00:15:32,797 --> 00:15:36,468
New jokes?
You guys tell me a joke.

132
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:39,136
A dog's always
in the push-up position.

133
00:15:39,170 --> 00:15:41,040
Mitch Hedberg.
Search him up.

134
00:15:42,273 --> 00:15:43,808
Mitch Hedberg?
Who's that?

135
00:15:43,841 --> 00:15:46,377
A comedian
that's actually good.

136
00:15:47,177 --> 00:15:48,513
Oh, the bus is here.

137
00:15:49,747 --> 00:15:51,250
Bye, Dad.

138
00:15:52,584 --> 00:15:53,852
Bye, boys.

139
00:15:53,884 --> 00:15:55,520
[excited laughter]

140
00:17:04,789 --> 00:17:06,425
What the hell?

141
00:17:07,725 --> 00:17:09,394
[sighs]

142
00:17:10,427 --> 00:17:11,796
Jess!

143
00:17:13,231 --> 00:17:14,700
- Jess!
- [door opens]

144
00:17:17,467 --> 00:17:18,936
What are you doing?

145
00:17:18,969 --> 00:17:20,404
[door closes]

146
00:17:21,472 --> 00:17:23,308
Where are you going? Hey!

147
00:17:30,881 --> 00:17:32,517
What are you doing?

148
00:17:33,517 --> 00:17:35,753
Just didn't wanna
go to school.

149
00:17:35,786 --> 00:17:38,322
Your jacket's about to fall
out of your backpack.

150
00:17:45,663 --> 00:17:47,532
Hey, David.

151
00:17:47,564 --> 00:17:51,503
Hey, Jeremy.
Teenager stuff.

152
00:17:51,535 --> 00:17:53,470
Yeah, thought
I'd kill mine sometimes.

153
00:17:53,503 --> 00:17:55,974
Hey, well, if you don't see this
one the next couple of days,

154
00:17:56,006 --> 00:17:57,975
it'll be our secret.

155
00:17:58,009 --> 00:18:00,445
I got a spot in the back
if you need it.

156
00:18:01,678 --> 00:18:04,882
That's a little weird, Jeremy.
Thank you, though.

157
00:18:06,650 --> 00:18:08,586
What are you doing?

158
00:18:08,619 --> 00:18:10,455
- [Jess] Just let go. I'm not five.
- [David] You're not five?

159
00:18:37,014 --> 00:18:39,251
[engine idling]

160
00:18:41,519 --> 00:18:43,455
[sighs]

161
00:18:47,992 --> 00:18:49,661
I know it's not easy.

162
00:18:57,734 --> 00:18:59,370
Mom's cheating on you.

163
00:19:05,709 --> 00:19:07,278
[engine turns off]

164
00:19:09,513 --> 00:19:11,582
- No, she's not.
- Yeah, she is.

165
00:19:11,616 --> 00:19:13,518
I saw the guy
leaving this morning.

166
00:19:13,551 --> 00:19:16,655
Jess, we agreed that we could see
other people during this time.

167
00:19:16,687 --> 00:19:19,390
- Oh, so you're just seeing other people too?
- It doesn't matter.

168
00:19:19,424 --> 00:19:20,992
It's none of your business
what we're doing.

169
00:19:21,024 --> 00:19:22,960
It wasn't supposed to be
any of your business.

170
00:19:22,994 --> 00:19:24,896
None of my business?
This is my family too.

171
00:19:24,928 --> 00:19:26,630
But, Jess, you're the kid.
We're the parents.

172
00:19:26,664 --> 00:19:28,433
We've gotta have time
to figure this out.

173
00:19:28,465 --> 00:19:30,869
- That's stupid.
- It's not stupid.

174
00:19:30,901 --> 00:19:33,804
Look, there's nothing I can say to you that's
not gonna make me out to be a loser dad.

175
00:19:33,838 --> 00:19:35,874
- Don't say that.
- You're right, okay?

176
00:19:35,907 --> 00:19:38,943
But I'm not gonna make your mom out
to be the villain in this thing.

177
00:19:38,975 --> 00:19:40,712
She's not a bad person.

178
00:19:42,879 --> 00:19:44,983
Look...

179
00:19:45,015 --> 00:19:46,984
Jess, we got married
right out of high school,

180
00:19:47,017 --> 00:19:49,787
we had you, then the boys.

181
00:19:49,821 --> 00:19:51,689
We never knew
that we were gonna...

182
00:19:52,790 --> 00:19:54,725
question things
when we got older.

183
00:19:54,759 --> 00:19:57,296
- That's bullshit.
- It is not bull...

184
00:19:58,963 --> 00:20:01,332
You know, I wish somebody
would've told me

185
00:20:01,366 --> 00:20:02,967
that it's never gonna stop.

186
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,769
It's never gonna
get easy, okay?

187
00:20:04,801 --> 00:20:06,870
You're not gonna just be an
adult and all of a sudden,

188
00:20:06,904 --> 00:20:09,840
you don't question anything
that happens in life.

189
00:20:09,873 --> 00:20:13,511
We're trying, Jess,
but there's no dadgum road map. Okay?

190
00:20:14,544 --> 00:20:16,413
Why can't you guys
just be together?

191
00:20:16,446 --> 00:20:19,551
Like Grandma and Grandpa!
They've been together for years.

192
00:20:22,786 --> 00:20:24,588
We're trying, Jess.

193
00:20:27,859 --> 00:20:29,093
I promise.

194
00:20:32,062 --> 00:20:34,800
Well, figure your shit out,
because it's ruining my life.

195
00:20:41,671 --> 00:20:43,475
You forgot your backpack.

196
00:20:47,878 --> 00:20:51,081
If you want, we can just
pretend none of that happened.

197
00:20:51,115 --> 00:20:54,152
You know, you can do it
all over again if you want.

198
00:20:54,185 --> 00:20:56,754
Forget the buildup
and the drama.

199
00:20:59,055 --> 00:21:00,558
You know, Dad...

200
00:21:03,060 --> 00:21:04,663
you need to fight.

201
00:21:06,430 --> 00:21:08,032
You need to fight for us.

202
00:21:18,509 --> 00:21:19,811
[woman] Hey, David.

203
00:21:20,878 --> 00:21:22,513
Hi, Mrs. Allen.

204
00:21:24,581 --> 00:21:26,417
[engine starts]

205
00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:05,156
- Morning, Mrs. Staples.
- Morning.

206
00:22:05,188 --> 00:22:06,590
How are you?

207
00:22:06,623 --> 00:22:08,592
Well, I can't complain.

208
00:22:08,626 --> 00:22:11,196
Had the grandkids over to
the house for the weekend.

209
00:22:11,228 --> 00:22:13,965
That was fun.
But it's fun to send them home too.

210
00:22:13,997 --> 00:22:15,833
[chuckles] I'm sure.

211
00:22:15,867 --> 00:22:18,536
- [chuckles] How's your dad?
- He's good.

212
00:22:18,569 --> 00:22:20,938
Just farting around, you know.
Trying to stay busy.

213
00:22:20,972 --> 00:22:24,475
[Mrs. Staples] I keep telling
him, we're both lonely widows.

214
00:22:24,509 --> 00:22:28,513
Why not jump in a fox hole
together and fool around? [laughs]

215
00:22:28,545 --> 00:22:32,549
- What does he... Really, you told my dad...
- He doesn't mention me?

216
00:22:32,582 --> 00:22:36,521
- It's not that he doesn't mention you...
- Ah! I'll leave it there.

217
00:22:36,553 --> 00:22:38,590
Let's get down to business.
You mind driving?

218
00:22:38,622 --> 00:22:40,157
No, no, ma'am.
Come on.

219
00:22:42,126 --> 00:22:45,096
[Mrs. Staples] Gonna head down
that road about a mile.

220
00:22:47,164 --> 00:22:49,167
- All right, thank you.
- Yes, ma'am.

221
00:23:19,696 --> 00:23:21,065
All right.

222
00:23:21,898 --> 00:23:25,302
This is it
in all its glory.

223
00:23:25,336 --> 00:23:29,541
Now I need for you to get
rid of it any way you like.

224
00:23:29,573 --> 00:23:34,144
You can sell anything you think has
value, pocket the money, no problem.

225
00:23:37,881 --> 00:23:39,716
What do you think?

226
00:23:39,750 --> 00:23:44,656
I don't know, maybe two
weeks, we can have, say...

227
00:23:45,923 --> 00:23:48,527
Hundred dollars a day
seem fair to you?

228
00:23:49,126 --> 00:23:50,896
Sounds about all right.

229
00:23:52,228 --> 00:23:54,064
Okay.

230
00:23:54,098 --> 00:23:56,200
All right, come on.
I'll take you back up to the house.

231
00:23:56,233 --> 00:24:01,272
Oh, no need. I need to exercise.
I'll walk back.

232
00:24:01,304 --> 00:24:02,773
You sure?

233
00:24:02,807 --> 00:24:05,209
No, but I figure
I'll risk it.

234
00:24:05,242 --> 00:24:07,745
You need anything,
you let me know.

235
00:24:10,046 --> 00:24:11,782
Mrs. Staples?

236
00:24:11,815 --> 00:24:13,050
Hmm?

237
00:24:15,820 --> 00:24:17,888
Did you and Tom
have a good marriage?

238
00:24:18,356 --> 00:24:19,858
[laughs]

239
00:24:22,627 --> 00:24:24,896
Well, not particularly.

240
00:24:28,698 --> 00:24:30,000
Why?

241
00:24:31,202 --> 00:24:34,005
Ah, just curious
if you were happy.

242
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:37,108
[chuckles]

243
00:24:40,077 --> 00:24:44,015
Tom was a good man.
I'm a decent woman.

244
00:24:44,048 --> 00:24:46,917
I loved him.
He loved me.

245
00:24:46,951 --> 00:24:52,791
But a real marriage,
it takes respect over love.

246
00:24:54,658 --> 00:24:58,028
David, love is a feeling,
and feelings,

247
00:24:58,061 --> 00:25:00,631
they move in,
they move out.

248
00:25:03,234 --> 00:25:05,704
You and Niki
will work it out.

249
00:25:06,971 --> 00:25:08,607
Now you get to work.

250
00:25:10,975 --> 00:25:12,843
I'm gonna walk
on the left side.

251
00:25:12,877 --> 00:25:14,646
You look as you leave,

252
00:25:14,678 --> 00:25:17,782
- in case I'm face down, dead in the gutter.
- [chuckles]

253
00:25:17,814 --> 00:25:19,049
Yes, ma'am.

254
00:25:55,086 --> 00:25:56,921
[grunts]

255
00:26:59,516 --> 00:27:01,985
- [TV playing]
- [knocking on door]

256
00:27:02,019 --> 00:27:03,054
[Niki] Jess!

257
00:27:03,087 --> 00:27:04,955
[Jess] One minute, Mom.

258
00:27:06,557 --> 00:27:08,159
- [door opens]
- [Bug] Ah!

259
00:27:08,192 --> 00:27:09,761
- [David laughs]
- [Niki] Daddy's here.

260
00:27:09,793 --> 00:27:11,795
Please finish the sandwiches
and put those away?

261
00:27:11,829 --> 00:27:13,798
- [Jess] Home by 9:00, got it?
- Got it.

262
00:27:15,166 --> 00:27:17,969
- What's up, boys?
- All right, David, let's go.

263
00:27:18,002 --> 00:27:19,070
Hey.

264
00:27:20,838 --> 00:27:22,540
- You ready?
- [Niki] Yeah.

265
00:27:22,572 --> 00:27:24,475
All right, y'all be good
for your sister, okay?

266
00:27:24,507 --> 00:27:26,009
- Okay, Dad.
- Yeah, sure.

267
00:27:26,042 --> 00:27:28,012
Boys, listen to your sister.
Give me a kiss.

268
00:27:28,044 --> 00:27:30,214
[kisses] I love you.

269
00:27:30,246 --> 00:27:31,850
- Hey, Jess.
- Kiss?

270
00:27:34,451 --> 00:27:35,820
Let's go.

271
00:27:38,022 --> 00:27:40,191
- Y'all be good.
- Bye, Dad.

272
00:27:43,359 --> 00:27:46,330
[Niki]
I'm sorry about that.

273
00:27:46,362 --> 00:27:49,432
I talked with Jess. She knew.
She just wanted to make a fight.

274
00:27:49,465 --> 00:27:52,235
Well, it's hard.
It's got to be harder on her,

275
00:27:52,269 --> 00:27:54,038
being older, more aware,
you know?

276
00:27:54,071 --> 00:27:57,975
Yeah. Plus she's a teenager.
Girls that age...

277
00:27:59,376 --> 00:28:01,145
got their own drama going on.

278
00:28:01,177 --> 00:28:03,446
What's going on?

279
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:09,020
Oh, just, you know, one day, best friends
with someone, next day she wants to end them.

280
00:28:09,052 --> 00:28:11,188
Typical teenage girls.

281
00:28:11,222 --> 00:28:12,490
Oh, right.

282
00:28:17,093 --> 00:28:19,429
You're going proper now?

283
00:28:19,463 --> 00:28:22,465
Unless it's demeaning, then you can open
your own door. I certainly don't wanna...

284
00:28:22,498 --> 00:28:24,268
I'll take the gesture.

285
00:28:28,438 --> 00:28:29,840
Thank you.

286
00:28:35,346 --> 00:28:36,414
[phone vibrates]

287
00:28:36,446 --> 00:28:38,616
All right. Here we go.

288
00:28:38,648 --> 00:28:39,984
Hey.

289
00:28:42,919 --> 00:28:44,822
You mind if we stay close?

290
00:28:49,392 --> 00:28:51,161
I had all night
planned for tonight.

291
00:28:51,195 --> 00:28:52,562
Jess just hasn't been great,

292
00:28:52,596 --> 00:28:54,866
and I'm nervous
with her watching the boys.

293
00:28:54,898 --> 00:28:57,601
The boys can take care of themselves.
She has to be there just in case.

294
00:28:57,635 --> 00:28:59,604
I know, but it's just
gonna stress me out.

295
00:28:59,637 --> 00:29:02,240
Plus she has that show later
with her friends.

296
00:29:07,311 --> 00:29:09,981
We agreed we were gonna make
date night a priority.

297
00:29:10,013 --> 00:29:14,051
It is, but we also
still have to be parents.

298
00:29:18,488 --> 00:29:19,857
You're right.

299
00:29:22,626 --> 00:29:24,095
[sighs]

300
00:29:25,262 --> 00:29:26,531
I'm sorry.

301
00:29:27,298 --> 00:29:28,600
No, you're right.

302
00:29:30,266 --> 00:29:32,236
Life's still happening,
right?

303
00:29:36,473 --> 00:29:38,075
[groans]

304
00:29:38,108 --> 00:29:40,176
You mind if we just
drive around the block

305
00:29:40,209 --> 00:29:43,247
and then come back here,
just so they think we've left?

306
00:29:47,051 --> 00:29:48,552
[exhales]

307
00:29:51,288 --> 00:29:53,424
[engine starts]

308
00:29:55,059 --> 00:29:56,627
Thank you.

309
00:29:56,659 --> 00:29:58,061
[groans]

310
00:30:00,697 --> 00:30:02,300
[sighs]

311
00:30:09,106 --> 00:30:10,541
[sighs]

312
00:30:43,674 --> 00:30:44,975
You warm enough?

313
00:30:45,009 --> 00:30:46,277
Yeah. Thank you.

314
00:31:01,492 --> 00:31:02,994
How are things?

315
00:31:04,028 --> 00:31:07,131
Good. Spent the week
at Mrs. Staples'.

316
00:31:08,165 --> 00:31:09,600
Nice.

317
00:31:17,273 --> 00:31:19,075
How's your dad?

318
00:31:19,109 --> 00:31:20,311
He's good.

319
00:31:23,213 --> 00:31:25,316
He's funny.

320
00:31:25,349 --> 00:31:27,685
I, uh...
It's like the time

321
00:31:27,717 --> 00:31:30,186
between now and high school
never happened.

322
00:31:30,219 --> 00:31:32,622
- Yeah?
- Yeah, you know,

323
00:31:32,656 --> 00:31:35,059
it's like my chores have
just been waiting on me.

324
00:31:35,091 --> 00:31:36,627
So now that
I've moved back home,

325
00:31:36,659 --> 00:31:38,495
I'm expected to
take out the trash,

326
00:31:38,529 --> 00:31:41,032
cut the grass, dishes,
like, whatever.

327
00:31:41,064 --> 00:31:44,167
So, my first night back,

328
00:31:44,201 --> 00:31:46,137
and I can't remember
when trash night was.

329
00:31:46,169 --> 00:31:49,773
So, I wake up the next morning.
It's not done.

330
00:31:49,807 --> 00:31:52,476
And Dad gives me
the exact same lecture

331
00:31:52,509 --> 00:31:54,145
I used to get
in high school.

332
00:31:54,177 --> 00:31:55,378
[laughs] Really?

333
00:31:55,411 --> 00:31:56,679
Yeah. Uh, verbatim.

334
00:31:56,713 --> 00:31:58,282
Except the only
difference is,

335
00:31:58,314 --> 00:31:59,716
Mom always used to
give it to me,

336
00:31:59,750 --> 00:32:01,719
but now it's Dad,
and, I mean,

337
00:32:01,752 --> 00:32:05,255
- word for word, the exact same.
- [laughs]

338
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:12,463
- I'll pull up back here so they can't see us.
- Yeah, perfect.

339
00:32:19,602 --> 00:32:21,638
Yeah. It's all good.

340
00:32:22,339 --> 00:32:23,640
[engine turns off]

341
00:32:24,340 --> 00:32:25,575
[groans]

342
00:32:27,211 --> 00:32:29,113
You think you'll get
your own place?

343
00:32:34,217 --> 00:32:36,821
I hope not, Niki.

344
00:32:41,291 --> 00:32:43,160
I mean, what are we doing?

345
00:32:44,794 --> 00:32:47,697
- Am I delusional about this whole thing?
- I'm sorry. I misspoke.

346
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:51,869
I...

347
00:32:51,901 --> 00:32:53,303
Um, David...

348
00:32:55,304 --> 00:32:57,740
I just meant that we could
figure it out if we needed,

349
00:32:57,773 --> 00:33:02,146
getting you your own place if it's
hard living with your dad, that's all.

350
00:33:02,178 --> 00:33:04,715
No, it's Dad, you know?

351
00:33:06,449 --> 00:33:08,318
I think he likes
having me there.

352
00:33:10,654 --> 00:33:14,458
Not walking around the house
talking to himself. I mean, he's...

353
00:33:14,491 --> 00:33:17,360
still yelling at the TV,
you know, but...

354
00:33:17,394 --> 00:33:19,430
it's a little less weird
if I'm there.

355
00:33:22,866 --> 00:33:24,202
[sighs]

356
00:33:28,272 --> 00:33:29,607
So, how's work?

357
00:33:32,341 --> 00:33:33,543
Good.

358
00:33:37,246 --> 00:33:38,715
Some good cases.

359
00:33:39,917 --> 00:33:43,186
Judy's letting me do
more work on the cases.

360
00:33:44,921 --> 00:33:47,124
She says I should
consider law school...

361
00:33:47,925 --> 00:33:49,894
though she doesn't
want to lose me.

362
00:33:56,832 --> 00:33:58,369
You thinking about it?

363
00:33:59,969 --> 00:34:01,371
Kinda.

364
00:34:03,974 --> 00:34:06,644
I don't know. It's only been three
months, so we'll see.

365
00:34:06,676 --> 00:34:10,348
I don't know if it's something I'll get
bored of once it isn't exciting anymore.

366
00:34:16,420 --> 00:34:18,355
No way you'll get bored,
smart as you are.

367
00:34:18,388 --> 00:34:21,891
Heck, I wish I could have
had the babies, you know.

368
00:34:21,924 --> 00:34:23,726
Just been
a stay-at-home dad.

369
00:34:23,759 --> 00:34:26,429
You could have gone and you'd
have made partner by now.

370
00:34:26,462 --> 00:34:28,765
We wouldn't be stressed
about money all the time.

371
00:34:28,799 --> 00:34:32,302
We've always had what we needed, David.
You've always provided.

372
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:54,625
So what did you have planned
before Jess ruined it?

373
00:34:54,657 --> 00:34:56,661
Oh, save it for another time.

374
00:34:58,328 --> 00:34:59,797
- Come on.
- No.

375
00:34:59,830 --> 00:35:03,366
I'll imagine it now
and we can do it another time.

376
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:05,302
I... [sighs]

377
00:35:08,804 --> 00:35:10,607
Tell me a little, at least.

378
00:35:11,708 --> 00:35:14,445
[sighs] You know, I, um...

379
00:35:15,344 --> 00:35:18,381
started writing again,
you know.

380
00:35:19,516 --> 00:35:21,318
Punk songs?

381
00:35:21,351 --> 00:35:24,888
No, not punk songs again.
I can't yell like that anymore.

382
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:28,625
Just, like, singer-songwriter stuff.
You know, no big deal.

383
00:35:29,525 --> 00:35:30,927
[splutters]

384
00:35:31,828 --> 00:35:33,964
Gonna go back on the road?

385
00:35:33,996 --> 00:35:37,033
Yup. [sighs] Thought
about giving it all up.

386
00:35:37,067 --> 00:35:38,869
Loading up the boys,
starting a band.

387
00:35:38,902 --> 00:35:39,936
[laughing]

388
00:35:39,969 --> 00:35:41,571
Cruise the countryside,

389
00:35:41,605 --> 00:35:43,507
stop in all the colleges
along the way.

390
00:35:45,509 --> 00:35:48,579
Why not? You're still young.

391
00:35:50,580 --> 00:35:53,683
- Okay, well, I gotta hear it.
- I'm not gonna play it.

392
00:35:53,717 --> 00:35:55,619
- Come on, babe.
- I don't have the guitar or anything.

393
00:35:55,652 --> 00:35:59,290
Well, you don't need the guitar.
You just have your voice.

394
00:35:59,322 --> 00:36:01,792
Your voice is just fine.

395
00:36:01,824 --> 00:36:04,728
It's always been the best part.
The band just supported it.

396
00:36:05,929 --> 00:36:07,999
I think the band
helped cover the flaws.

397
00:36:09,933 --> 00:36:11,302
No.

- Jess, right?
- Yeah.

Uh, sorry, thought the little
guy was gonna go get your mom.

- She's not home. She's out with my dad.

Or, I mean, she's inside

I promise
I'm not a creeper.

Um, do you know
when she'll be back?

433
00:39:19,688 --> 00:39:20,957
Are you a psycho?

434
00:39:22,025 --> 00:39:24,194
Excuse me?

435
00:39:24,226 --> 00:39:27,263
Why do you think I would tell you?
I don't even know you.

- No, I know.
- Who are you?

437
00:39:29,532 --> 00:39:33,737
I'm just a friend.
I work with your mom. I mean, uh...

438
00:39:33,770 --> 00:39:37,708
Yeah, stopping by really late to
give her flowers. Real friendly.

439

My friends do that
all the time.

440

No, I know. Uh, she just...

441
00:39:41,777 --> 00:39:43,880
Your mom got a promotion
at work and...

442
00:39:44,647 --> 00:39:46,115
trying to congratulate her.

443
00:39:46,148 --> 00:39:48,284
Yeah, that doesn't make it
any less weird.

444
00:39:48,317 --> 00:39:50,620
Listen, she goes to work
on Monday,

445
00:39:50,654 --> 00:39:52,089
so if you guys
work together,

446
00:39:52,121 --> 00:39:54,225
you can give her
the flowers yourself.

447
00:39:56,025 --> 00:39:58,261
Actually, do you mind
giving them to her?

448
00:39:58,295 --> 00:40:00,130
Can't you give them
to her at work?

449
00:40:00,163 --> 00:40:02,933
Yeah, but I'd rather
she had them fresh.

450

Can we try this
again sometime?

Of course.

needs to accompany that song.

Yeah, it's so late.

come by and say good night and I love you.

Okay.

507
00:44:58,127 --> 00:45:00,462
Hey. So I saw this wino

508
00:45:00,496 --> 00:45:03,266
on the street the other day
and he was eating a grape.

509
00:45:03,299 --> 00:45:04,467
And I was like, "Hey, dude."

510
00:45:04,500 --> 00:45:06,003
What's a wino?

511
00:45:06,869 --> 00:45:08,438
It's like a, uh...

512
00:45:08,471 --> 00:45:11,275
You know, like a homeless guy
that drinks a lot of wine.

513
00:45:12,074 --> 00:45:13,277
All right.

514
00:45:14,243 --> 00:45:16,446
So, no matter how good
I get at tennis,

515
00:45:16,478 --> 00:45:18,581
I'll never be
as good as a wall.

516
00:45:18,614 --> 00:45:20,883
That was not good.

517
00:45:20,917 --> 00:45:22,284
Better jokes, Dad.

518
00:45:22,317 --> 00:45:25,287
Look, if I had
nine fingers cut off,

519
00:45:25,321 --> 00:45:28,023
I wouldn't be
any worse at typing.

520
00:45:28,056 --> 00:45:30,125
Hey, don't shut...
What are you talking about?

521
00:45:30,159 --> 00:45:32,295
This is your guy.
I looked him up on Netflix.

522
00:45:32,328 --> 00:45:33,630
Seriously?

523
00:45:33,663 --> 00:45:35,998
Yes, it's
the Mitch Hedberg guy.

524
00:45:36,031 --> 00:45:39,101
Yeah, but you, like,
picked all the dark chocolates in there.

525
00:45:39,134 --> 00:45:42,138
What are you talking about?
You said the other day, you were like,

526
00:45:42,170 --> 00:45:44,174
"A dog is always
in the push-up position."

527
00:45:44,206 --> 00:45:46,243
- Yeah, but that's funny.
- That's not funny.

528
00:45:46,275 --> 00:45:47,610
It is really funny.

529
00:45:47,643 --> 00:45:49,245
That's really funny,
but the guy...

530
00:45:49,279 --> 00:45:50,981
Tennis against the wall
is not funny?

531
00:45:51,014 --> 00:45:52,916
That's not funny at all.

532
00:45:52,949 --> 00:45:54,184
Whatever.

533
00:45:54,217 --> 00:45:55,552
You can't be good
at tennis,

534
00:45:55,585 --> 00:45:57,621
but not beat yourself
in tennis.

535
00:45:57,654 --> 00:46:00,389
The point is, it's like the wall.
Like, you can't...

536
00:46:00,422 --> 00:46:03,158
The wall's gonna send it
in any direction.

537
00:46:03,192 --> 00:46:05,061
- Yeah, I got that one.
- Okay.

538
00:46:05,094 --> 00:46:06,596
It wasn't funny.

539
00:46:06,628 --> 00:46:08,964
Hey, you wanna climb out
and look at the stars?

540
00:46:08,998 --> 00:46:10,433
It's 4:00.

541
00:46:10,465 --> 00:46:12,268
It's not 4:00.

542
00:46:12,302 --> 00:46:14,471
Okay, then, it's like
2:00 in the morning.

543
00:46:14,503 --> 00:46:15,538
All right.

544
00:46:16,572 --> 00:46:19,209
Y'all go to sleep.
[kisses]

545
00:46:19,241 --> 00:46:21,510
- Love you, Dad.
- I love you too.

546
00:46:21,543 --> 00:46:23,379
All right, get in.

547
00:46:23,413 --> 00:46:24,982
Go get in bed.

548
00:46:28,985 --> 00:46:30,453
Night.

549
00:46:30,485 --> 00:46:32,955
Hey, tell Bug and Jess
I love them, okay?

550
00:46:32,989 --> 00:46:34,523
Okay.

551
00:46:57,212 --> 00:46:58,648
[grunting]

552
00:47:09,458 --> 00:47:10,993
Hey, David.

553
00:47:15,230 --> 00:47:16,933
- Hey.
- Hey.

554
00:47:19,002 --> 00:47:22,038
Did you wake the boys up
last night and talk to them?

555
00:47:22,071 --> 00:47:23,540
What?

556
00:47:23,572 --> 00:47:26,009
Alex told me you were
telling him and Theo

557
00:47:26,042 --> 00:47:28,011
Mitch Hedberg jokes.

558
00:47:28,043 --> 00:47:29,712
Oh, yeah.

559
00:47:29,746 --> 00:47:32,182
I couldn't sleep last night and
the boys have been telling me

560
00:47:32,214 --> 00:47:35,050
to look up this guy's stuff,
so I did.

561
00:47:35,083 --> 00:47:38,087
I just went over there to share
some of the funny ones with them.

562
00:47:39,721 --> 00:47:41,991
Do you think
that was a good idea?

563
00:47:43,359 --> 00:47:45,027
What, you think
it was a bad one?

564
00:47:45,060 --> 00:47:47,163
I think
it's a little confusing.

565
00:47:52,034 --> 00:47:54,170
What's confusing
about it?

566
00:47:54,203 --> 00:47:58,273
I don't know, their dad knocking on
their window at 4:00 in the morning?

567
00:47:58,306 --> 00:48:00,609
No, no, no. It was 2:30.

568
00:48:00,643 --> 00:48:03,279
- [scoffs]
- And if I'd have... No, no, hold on, Niki.

569
00:48:03,311 --> 00:48:05,781
If I'd have woken up...
If I was living in the house

570
00:48:05,815 --> 00:48:08,385
and I'd gone in there and got
the boys up to tell 'em a joke,

571
00:48:08,418 --> 00:48:11,253
- you wouldn't have a problem, so why do you have one now?
- It's not about the jokes.

572
00:48:11,286 --> 00:48:13,489
- Then what is it about?
- Are you kidding me?

573
00:48:13,522 --> 00:48:15,357
Am I kidding you?

574
00:48:15,391 --> 00:48:17,627
You're gonna come over
here now and give me crap,

575
00:48:17,659 --> 00:48:20,196
when I'm living with my dad and
you're in there with the boys?

576
00:48:20,228 --> 00:48:22,531
Oh, my God.

577
00:48:22,565 --> 00:48:24,034
You've gotta be sensitive to the fact
that I don't get to spend time with them.

578
00:48:24,067 --> 00:48:25,467
So I gotta sneak over there

579
00:48:25,500 --> 00:48:27,203
and tell them something
in the middle of the night

580
00:48:27,235 --> 00:48:28,471
and you hear about it
at breakfast...

581
00:48:28,503 --> 00:48:31,107
You are not the only one.
Fuck you.

582
00:48:31,139 --> 00:48:32,574
Oh, that's nice.
That's nice.

583
00:48:32,607 --> 00:48:34,176
- You think...
- You hear that? There we go.

584
00:48:34,210 --> 00:48:36,413
Oh, my...

585
00:48:36,446 --> 00:48:40,482
Do you think breakfast is like <i>Leave
It to Beaver</i> or something? You think...

586
00:48:40,516 --> 00:48:42,218
Hold... Look...
Can you look at me?

587
00:48:42,250 --> 00:48:44,153
You think... You think
they were telling on you?

588
00:48:44,186 --> 00:48:46,255
I don't know.
I'm not in the house.

589
00:48:46,288 --> 00:48:49,391
They weren't, okay? They were excited,
like it was a good thing, okay?

590
00:48:49,424 --> 00:48:51,326
Like, they were happy
about it.

591
00:48:51,360 --> 00:48:53,596
You're out of the house
and you're still cool to them.

592
00:48:53,628 --> 00:48:56,433
Don't fucking charge at me
like that.

593
00:49:02,337 --> 00:49:04,406
[sighs]

594
00:49:04,440 --> 00:49:08,412
You're right. It won't happen again.
My apologies.

595
00:49:09,779 --> 00:49:13,650
David, come on, stop.
We need to talk about this.

596
00:49:13,683 --> 00:49:16,219
- We already talked about it.
- [engine starts]

597
00:49:16,252 --> 00:49:18,654
David, can you stop
the truck, please?

598
00:49:18,688 --> 00:49:21,425
- What are you doing? What are you doing?
- Can you stop the truck?

599
00:49:29,165 --> 00:49:31,802
[tires screech, engine revving]

600
00:50:26,422 --> 00:50:29,391
[grunting]

601
00:50:42,237 --> 00:50:43,607
Fucking David.

602
00:51:26,882 --> 00:51:28,351
[metal clinking]

603
00:51:38,427 --> 00:51:39,829
[cocks gun]

604
00:51:45,835 --> 00:51:48,304
[gunshots echoing]

605
00:51:57,746 --> 00:51:59,582
[dog barking]

606
00:52:50,532 --> 00:52:52,502
[train horn blows]

607
00:53:20,696 --> 00:53:22,565
[engine starts]

608
00:54:29,598 --> 00:54:31,734
Hi, how are you
doing today?

609
00:54:31,766 --> 00:54:33,034
- Good.
- Great.

610
00:54:33,067 --> 00:54:34,870
You find everything okay?

611
00:54:34,904 --> 00:54:36,839
- Yeah, just looking.
- All right.

612
00:54:36,871 --> 00:54:39,509
Well, let me know if you
need a hand with anything.

613
00:54:39,542 --> 00:54:41,744
[echoing] Anything I can do,
just holler...

614
00:54:51,953 --> 00:54:54,556
[register beeping]

615
00:55:07,770 --> 00:55:09,005
[boys yelling]

616
00:55:09,038 --> 00:55:12,007
- Hey!
- [boy] Dad!

617
00:55:12,040 --> 00:55:13,909
[laughing]

618
00:55:13,942 --> 00:55:15,977
What's up, buddy?

619
00:55:16,011 --> 00:55:17,612
Hi!

620
00:55:17,645 --> 00:55:20,749
[roaring]

621
00:55:20,782 --> 00:55:22,418
How are you?

622
00:55:24,152 --> 00:55:26,054
Good. Can we climb
in the back?

623
00:55:26,087 --> 00:55:27,956
Hey, hey, no, no,
don't get in the back.

624
00:55:27,989 --> 00:55:30,560
You can get back there,
but do not go through those bags

625
00:55:30,592 --> 00:55:32,627
and do not look
under the blanket.

626
00:55:32,661 --> 00:55:34,063
- Hey.
- Could we slide down in there?

627
00:55:34,096 --> 00:55:36,098
Climb in over here.
The door's broken.

628
00:55:36,130 --> 00:55:37,732
[boy]
Could we ride in the back?

629
00:55:37,766 --> 00:55:39,702
No, you can't ride
in the back.

630
00:55:39,735 --> 00:55:41,604
Give me a kiss. Come on.

631
00:55:41,636 --> 00:55:43,638
Just get in and go, please,
and get this over with?

632
00:55:43,672 --> 00:55:45,007
You can if you pay the toll.

633
00:55:45,040 --> 00:55:46,842
I'm not gonna pay
the toll, Dad.

634
00:55:46,875 --> 00:55:48,543
What is going on?

635
00:55:48,576 --> 00:55:50,912
- Load up. Let's go.
- Nothing. Nothing's wrong.

636
00:55:50,946 --> 00:55:53,016
- Drop it.
- Something is going on.

637
00:55:54,148 --> 00:55:55,984
Stop, stop, stop.

638
00:55:56,018 --> 00:55:57,786
Whee!

639
00:55:57,819 --> 00:55:59,554
[Jess] Nothing.
I don't want to talk about it.

640
00:55:59,587 --> 00:56:01,189
If you want me to come,
you'll drop it.

641
00:56:01,223 --> 00:56:02,891
Just leave me alone.

642
00:56:06,862 --> 00:56:09,065
All right, scrunch in.

643
00:56:09,098 --> 00:56:11,199
Scrunch in,
find your place.

644
00:56:11,232 --> 00:56:12,534
Guys.

645
00:56:14,904 --> 00:56:17,139
Jess doesn't want
to sit in the center.

646
00:56:17,172 --> 00:56:18,940
Come on. Sit down.

647
00:56:18,973 --> 00:56:20,476
Fine.

648
00:56:22,110 --> 00:56:24,513
- Who's ready for adventure?
- Yeah, where are we going?

649
00:56:24,547 --> 00:56:25,848
We're going to the park.

650
00:56:25,880 --> 00:56:27,282
- Wait, what's in the back?
- What?

651
00:56:27,315 --> 00:56:30,852
- Hey, there's a surprise...
- Oh!

652
00:56:30,886 --> 00:56:33,788
- ...at the park, not just the park.
- Oh.

653
00:56:33,822 --> 00:56:37,026
What if someone steals the surprise?
What if they take it?

654
00:56:37,058 --> 00:56:39,127
- How are they gonna take the prize?
- It's in the back.

655
00:56:39,161 --> 00:56:41,097
You said it's at the park,
though.

656
00:56:41,130 --> 00:56:43,833
No, it's in the back,
covered up in the blanket.

657
00:56:43,866 --> 00:56:46,835
That's why I don't want you
guys messing around back there.

658
00:56:48,103 --> 00:56:49,906
All right, how was school?

659
00:56:50,839 --> 00:56:52,241
- Awesome.
- Mmm, good.

660
00:56:52,273 --> 00:56:54,609
Oh, did I get "awesome"
and "good"?

661
00:56:54,643 --> 00:56:57,179
Good. Kinda nice.

662
00:56:57,212 --> 00:56:59,081
- I just hate math.
- Why do you hate math?

663
00:56:59,114 --> 00:57:01,984
Math is the only thing
that ruins the school.

664
00:57:02,016 --> 00:57:04,052
I love math.

665
00:57:04,085 --> 00:57:05,754
- See?
- You're one of the smart people.

666
00:57:05,788 --> 00:57:07,623
- Is art the best?
- No.

667
00:57:07,656 --> 00:57:08,991
You like art?

668
00:57:09,023 --> 00:57:10,326
- Art's good, right?
- Yeah, I guess.

669
00:57:10,359 --> 00:57:12,161
Yeah, art's good.

670
00:57:12,194 --> 00:57:14,563
- That's your favorite, right, Bug?
- Yeah.

671
00:57:14,596 --> 00:57:16,799
- Has he got something on his face?
- No.

672
00:57:16,831 --> 00:57:19,268
Art, theater, music.

673
00:57:19,301 --> 00:57:20,869
Oh, you bust your noggin?

674
00:57:20,902 --> 00:57:22,638
- Yeah.
- Running.

675
00:57:22,670 --> 00:57:24,239
- You all right?
- Yeah.

676
00:57:24,272 --> 00:57:26,174
- Was that today?
- Yeah.

677
00:57:27,342 --> 00:57:29,311
I ran a mile today.

678
00:57:29,344 --> 00:57:31,246
Oh, yeah?
What was your time on the mile?

679
00:57:31,279 --> 00:57:34,149
Um, I think it's a ten,
but I was in front of everybody.

680
00:57:34,183 --> 00:57:36,185
- Oh, nice.
- It was pretty good.

681
00:57:36,217 --> 00:57:38,053
That's good. How about you?
Did you run it?

682
00:57:38,087 --> 00:57:39,121
No.

683
00:57:39,888 --> 00:57:41,156
Why?

684
00:57:41,190 --> 00:57:43,025
I don't like running.

685
00:57:43,826 --> 00:57:45,828
- Wow.
- I would run.

686
00:57:45,860 --> 00:57:47,830
I would run it.

687
00:57:47,862 --> 00:57:49,264
I would run it.

688
00:57:49,297 --> 00:57:52,133
- How was school for you?
- I don't know.

689
00:57:52,167 --> 00:57:54,971
How was music and art

690
00:57:55,003 --> 00:57:57,272
and recess,
all the fun stuff?

691
00:57:57,306 --> 00:58:01,811
Well, I have, like,
hardly any time with recess.

692
00:58:02,344 --> 00:58:03,913
Well...

693
00:58:03,946 --> 00:58:05,982
Recess is the best.

694
00:58:06,014 --> 00:58:08,917
I have so many friends.
Tyson...

695
00:58:08,951 --> 00:58:10,853
What do you guys play
when you're at recess?

696
00:58:10,886 --> 00:58:12,822
- Zombie.
- You play Zombie?

697
00:58:12,855 --> 00:58:15,625
We play, like, zombies.

698
00:58:15,657 --> 00:58:17,860
Oh, wait. Zombies, like,
where you shoot zombies?

699
00:58:17,893 --> 00:58:23,132
Yeah, there's these kids
who act like zombies,

700
00:58:23,165 --> 00:58:26,701
then you get to be
a citizen or a shooter.

701
00:58:26,735 --> 00:58:28,871
I mainly be a citizen.

702
00:58:28,904 --> 00:58:31,641
Oh, no, I be
a shooter, actually.

703
00:58:32,741 --> 00:58:33,876
Yeah.

704
00:58:36,045 --> 00:58:38,380
Jess, how about you?
How was school?

705
00:58:38,413 --> 00:58:39,482
Just great.

706
00:58:41,116 --> 00:58:44,085
Who in the vehicle felt sarcasm
from the last statement?

707
00:58:44,118 --> 00:58:45,787
[laughing]
That was sarcasm!

708
00:58:45,821 --> 00:58:48,257
That's just, like,
a tiny bit or a whole lot?

709
00:58:48,290 --> 00:58:50,159
- No, a whole lot.
- A whole lot.

710
00:58:50,192 --> 00:58:52,762
- That was sarcasm. The whole thing.
- Yeah.

711
00:58:52,795 --> 00:58:54,964
It's sarcasm.

712
00:58:54,996 --> 00:58:56,297
It was nothing that...

713
00:58:56,331 --> 00:58:59,001
It was definitely good.

714
00:58:59,034 --> 00:59:01,270
It was sarcasm!

715
00:59:01,302 --> 00:59:05,907
Hey, Jess,
you can't have a bad time today.

716
00:59:05,940 --> 00:59:07,776
I dare you
to not have fun.

717
00:59:07,810 --> 00:59:09,779
- That's not the point.
- Try me.

718
00:59:09,811 --> 00:59:13,281
It's the park
and there's a surprise.

719
00:59:13,315 --> 00:59:15,717
- What's the point?
- I can't wait. I love surprises!

720
00:59:15,750 --> 00:59:17,185
What do you mean,
what's the point?

721
00:59:17,219 --> 00:59:20,423
What's the point
of someone,

722
00:59:20,456 --> 00:59:23,292
like, doing a surprise
for you,

723
00:59:23,324 --> 00:59:25,960
but then you're like,
"No, I hated it"?

724
00:59:25,993 --> 00:59:27,929
- All right, you ready?
- Yeah.

725
00:59:30,833 --> 00:59:33,168
[David] All right, here...
Here's this bag.

726
00:59:33,201 --> 00:59:35,270
- [boy] Oh!
- [David] What do you got in there? What is that?

727
00:59:35,304 --> 00:59:36,472
[boy] I don't know.

728
00:59:36,505 --> 00:59:38,840
[David]
What's on the pictures?

729
00:59:38,873 --> 00:59:40,009
Maybe...

730
00:59:40,042 --> 00:59:41,976
[boys shouting]

731
00:59:42,009 --> 00:59:43,712
[David] Oh, yeah!

732
00:59:44,413 --> 00:59:46,349
Come on,
let's go launch them.

733
00:59:51,819 --> 00:59:53,755
- See this little track?
- Whoa, that looks cool.

734
00:59:53,788 --> 00:59:57,325
All right? All right,
see a slide down on there?

735
00:59:57,359 --> 01:00:02,998
Okay, and then
we're gonna clamp, go one...

736
01:00:03,031 --> 01:00:06,768
But what happens when,
like, they're going high?

737
01:00:06,802 --> 01:00:08,304
So there's
this little bit of...

738
01:00:08,337 --> 01:00:10,773
There's this little engine
that's inside there.

739
01:00:10,806 --> 01:00:12,340
So, what,
it puts those off?

740
01:00:12,373 --> 01:00:15,276
Come here.
Yeah, it'll shoot it.

741
01:00:15,310 --> 01:00:19,514
So we're gonna stick
this button in here, okay,

742
01:00:19,547 --> 01:00:22,752
and then you hold
that button. Okay.

743
01:00:22,784 --> 01:00:25,987
Say, "Houston,
we're ready for takeoff"!

744
01:00:26,020 --> 01:00:29,891
Ten, nine, eight, seven...

745
01:00:29,924 --> 01:00:32,828
Whoa! [laughs]

746
01:00:33,261 --> 01:00:34,429
All right.

747
01:00:34,462 --> 01:00:36,498
- [explodes]
- Boo!

748
01:00:36,531 --> 01:00:37,966
[laughing]

749
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:39,902
All right, go get it,
go get it.

750
01:00:45,507 --> 01:00:48,444
All right, come back, come
back, come back, come back.

751
01:00:49,545 --> 01:00:51,981
- [boy] I want mine next!
- You wanna do yours next?

752
01:00:52,014 --> 01:00:53,182
I'm going next, actually.

753
01:00:53,214 --> 01:00:54,783
All right, let's go.

754
01:00:55,984 --> 01:00:58,154
Come on.

755
01:00:58,186 --> 01:00:59,889
Yeah, we'll pack it
all back in there

756
01:00:59,922 --> 01:01:01,157
and put another motor in it.

757
01:01:01,190 --> 01:01:02,792
- Okay, could I do one?
- Okay.

758
01:01:02,824 --> 01:01:04,826
Yeah, you wanna pitch it?
So, here you go.

759
01:01:04,860 --> 01:01:07,363
- Whoa, it all makes...
- All right.

760
01:01:07,395 --> 01:01:10,398
All right, here you go.
Just pitch 'em on there.

761
01:01:14,069 --> 01:01:15,503
Good job.

762
01:01:15,536 --> 01:01:18,174
- Do that one.
- But does it...

763
01:01:18,206 --> 01:01:20,009
Oh, you could hear a buzz.

764
01:01:20,042 --> 01:01:21,277
Uh-huh.

765
01:01:21,310 --> 01:01:23,012
There you go.

766
01:01:23,045 --> 01:01:24,447
Oh, mine doesn't...

767
01:01:26,014 --> 01:01:27,149
[whispers]
Okeydokey.

768
01:01:27,181 --> 01:01:28,850
- Go there. Got mine...
- Get this...

769
01:01:28,884 --> 01:01:31,219
Good job. We gotta get it
right on the ends there.

770
01:01:33,221 --> 01:01:35,156
- There we go.
- Okay.

771
01:01:35,190 --> 01:01:36,892
All right,
you grab your controller.

772
01:01:36,924 --> 01:01:38,092
Okay, where is it?

773
01:01:38,125 --> 01:01:39,360
- You see it?
- Right here.

774
01:01:39,393 --> 01:01:40,929
All right,

775
01:01:40,962 --> 01:01:43,598
All right. Okay.

776
01:01:43,632 --> 01:01:47,269
Ten, nine...
You do this button right here.

777
01:01:47,302 --> 01:01:53,309
Seven, six, five, four,

778
01:01:54,877 --> 01:01:57,045
- Whoa!

779
01:01:57,078 --> 01:01:58,947
All right, try to catch it,

780
01:01:58,980 --> 01:02:00,949
- [explodes]
- [yelling]

781
01:02:13,561 --> 01:02:15,498
Hey, Jess,
you want to do yours?

782
01:02:16,397 --> 01:02:18,200
Come on. Come on.

783
01:02:20,435 --> 01:02:23,404
- Hey! Alex, you okay if Jess goes?
- Yeah.

784
01:02:23,438 --> 01:02:25,474
All right,

785
01:02:25,507 --> 01:02:28,010
Let's get the big boy.

786
01:02:28,043 --> 01:02:31,280
Let's get the big boy!
All right.

787
01:02:32,681 --> 01:02:34,416
- You want to hook it up?
- Okay.

788
01:02:34,449 --> 01:02:37,052
All right, come on.
Here you go.

789
01:02:37,085 --> 01:02:38,420
How do you do it?

790
01:02:38,453 --> 01:02:40,556
All right, so,
we'll take it right here...

791
01:02:40,589 --> 01:02:43,625
- [coughing] This one's gonna be big.
- We'll put this one here,

792
01:02:43,659 --> 01:02:45,895
and we'll put it
right here.

793
01:02:45,927 --> 01:02:48,464
All right.
All right, boys.

794
01:02:48,496 --> 01:02:51,600
Houston, we are ready
for launch.

795
01:02:52,534 --> 01:02:53,903
- I'm gonna count yours.
- Okay.

796
01:02:53,935 --> 01:02:55,169
You ready?

797
01:02:55,203 --> 01:03:00,109
Ten, nine, eight,
seven, six,

798
01:03:00,141 --> 01:03:04,045
five, four, three,
two, one, go!

799
01:03:05,080 --> 01:03:06,248
Dad, it's not going.

800
01:03:06,281 --> 01:03:07,949
Okay, hold on,
hold on, hold on.

801
01:03:16,590 --> 01:03:19,295
All right. Let's go.

802
01:03:19,328 --> 01:03:22,998
Ten, nine, eight,
seven, six,

803
01:03:23,031 --> 01:03:27,036
five, four, three,
two, one, go!

804
01:03:28,636 --> 01:03:31,306
- It's not working. It's not working, Dad.
- Yeah, no, push this button.

805
01:03:31,339 --> 01:03:33,408
- I clicked the button!
- Push this button.

806
01:03:33,442 --> 01:03:34,710
- Hey, hold on.
- I hate this!

807
01:03:34,743 --> 01:03:37,645
Hey! Hey! Hey, Jess!

808
01:03:37,679 --> 01:03:39,481
What are you doing?

809
01:03:39,514 --> 01:03:40,716
- Hey!
- What you did!

810
01:03:40,748 --> 01:03:42,317
What do you mean,
what I did?

811
01:03:42,351 --> 01:03:44,086
You got mad
and walked away.

812
01:03:44,118 --> 01:03:45,954
I did not get mad
and walk away.

813
01:03:45,987 --> 01:03:47,956
Now don't do this here in
front of the boys. Stop it!

814
01:03:47,989 --> 01:03:49,590
That's exactly
what you did!

815
01:03:49,623 --> 01:03:51,392
I did not do anything.

816
01:03:51,426 --> 01:03:54,063
You know I'm fighting
as hard as I can for this.

817
01:03:54,096 --> 01:03:57,532
I don't want this. You think I want to
bring you guys down to a park on Saturday?

818
01:03:58,366 --> 01:03:59,435
Come on!

819
01:04:00,268 --> 01:04:02,036
I don't wanna do this.

820
01:04:02,069 --> 01:04:03,972
[sobbing]

821
01:04:04,005 --> 01:04:05,373
I'm sorry.

822
01:04:08,275 --> 01:04:10,045
It sucks for everybody.

823
01:04:12,047 --> 01:04:14,449
- [sniffles]
- I promise, though, I'm trying.

824
01:04:15,350 --> 01:04:17,118
Take me home.

825
01:04:17,152 --> 01:04:19,154
Come on. Let's just try
to fix this up.

826
01:04:19,186 --> 01:04:21,190
No, I wanna go home.
[sniffles]

827
01:04:28,295 --> 01:04:30,165
[bell tolling]

828
01:04:36,605 --> 01:04:38,074
Hey, I'm sorry.

829
01:04:44,478 --> 01:04:47,215
- Hey, next time, okay? You get to go next time.
- Okay.

830
01:04:47,248 --> 01:04:49,183
All right. Come on,
let's get our stuff.

831
01:04:49,217 --> 01:04:51,420
[sniffles]
Let's get our stuff.

832
01:05:01,730 --> 01:05:03,465
Could we keep
the parachute?

833
01:05:03,498 --> 01:05:05,567
Yeah, you can keep
the parachute.

834
01:05:05,600 --> 01:05:07,235
You can keep
the whole rocket.

835
01:05:07,268 --> 01:05:09,237
Can we hang them up
on our wall?

836
01:05:09,270 --> 01:05:11,706
Yeah, we'll hang them up inside your room.
That sound good?

837
01:05:11,739 --> 01:05:12,774
Yeah.

838
01:05:13,842 --> 01:05:16,177
- Thank you, Dad.
- Hey, that was so awesome

839
01:05:16,210 --> 01:05:18,179
when it went up, though,
wasn't it?

840
01:06:02,523 --> 01:06:05,393
Jess. Jess!

841
01:06:11,665 --> 01:06:13,234
[Jess] I hate this!

842
01:06:14,835 --> 01:06:17,438
All right, here.
I was gonna save these

843
01:06:17,471 --> 01:06:18,840
till after we launched
the rockets.

844
01:06:18,873 --> 01:06:20,676
Pick your flavor.

845
01:06:20,708 --> 01:06:23,178
All right. There you go.

846
01:06:25,813 --> 01:06:27,282
[Niki] Hey.

847
01:06:29,717 --> 01:06:31,853
What's going on?

848
01:06:31,886 --> 01:06:35,223
Hey, Mom, Dad got us
rockets and Jess broke hers

849
01:06:35,257 --> 01:06:37,793
and Alex
didn't get to shoot one.

850
01:06:37,826 --> 01:06:40,128
- [sighs]
- That's pretty play-by-play.

851
01:06:40,161 --> 01:06:42,497
Hey, boys, why don't you run in the
house quick and let me talk to Mom?

852
01:06:42,531 --> 01:06:44,398
- Are we gonna stay the night?
- Yeah.

853
01:06:44,431 --> 01:06:46,534
Just let me talk to Mom
and then we'll head out.

854
01:06:46,567 --> 01:06:48,736
Hey, why don't you guys
go to the Thompsons?

855
01:06:48,770 --> 01:06:51,107
I saw the boys
on their bikes earlier.

856
01:06:52,273 --> 01:06:54,208
- Yeah?
- That sound like a good idea?

857
01:06:54,241 --> 01:06:55,910
- Okay.
- All right. Go see the Thompson boys.

858
01:06:55,944 --> 01:06:57,446
We'll call you.

859
01:06:58,913 --> 01:07:00,315
Come on.

860
01:07:01,183 --> 01:07:02,418
[grunts]

861
01:07:03,585 --> 01:07:05,454
- Bye, Buggy.
- Bye.

862
01:07:07,455 --> 01:07:08,690
What's up?

863
01:07:09,590 --> 01:07:11,259
What do you mean?

864
01:07:11,293 --> 01:07:13,595
Jess was pissed
when I picked up the kids.

865
01:07:13,627 --> 01:07:15,430
- She was?
- Yeah.

866
01:07:16,864 --> 01:07:18,900
Okay. I asked her
not to be.

867
01:07:20,435 --> 01:07:23,572
What does that mean,
you asked her not to be?

868
01:07:23,605 --> 01:07:25,807
A bunch of her friends
were going to a show tonight,

869
01:07:25,839 --> 01:07:28,576
and she really
wanted to go.

870
01:07:28,610 --> 01:07:31,680
- And?
- And I told her she couldn't 'cause it's your time with them.

871
01:07:32,514 --> 01:07:33,782
Are you serious?

872
01:07:35,317 --> 01:07:37,485
What, David?

873
01:07:37,518 --> 01:07:39,888
- What do you mean, "What, David?"
- It's true.

874
01:07:39,920 --> 01:07:41,723
But you can't
keep doing this.

875
01:07:41,755 --> 01:07:44,192
You can't tell her
that she can't do something.

876
01:07:44,226 --> 01:07:45,861
It implies that
if it wasn't for me,

877
01:07:45,893 --> 01:07:48,196
you wouldn't have
a problem with it.

878
01:07:48,230 --> 01:07:51,333
- But I wouldn't.
- It doesn't matter if you would or wouldn't.

879
01:07:51,366 --> 01:07:54,268
When you say no,
it's making this time with me negative.

880
01:07:54,302 --> 01:07:56,438
That's all
she's associating it with.

881
01:07:56,471 --> 01:07:59,942
So tell her she...
Make up some excuse, say whatever it is.

882
01:07:59,975 --> 01:08:02,344
I will not teach our children
how to lie, David.

883
01:08:02,377 --> 01:08:03,811
Then tell her
that it's my decision.

884
01:08:03,844 --> 01:08:05,613
Say, "Go ask your dad,"
so that I can decide.

885
01:08:05,647 --> 01:08:07,748
I can make that decision,
Niki.

886
01:08:07,781 --> 01:08:10,685
I don't have to
have you do it for me.

887
01:08:10,719 --> 01:08:13,455
You gotta be sensitive
to how we talk to the kids.

888
01:08:13,487 --> 01:08:16,357
This is hard enough as it is.
You're not being nice or considerate.

889
01:08:17,726 --> 01:08:20,996
- I'm sorry, okay?
- Are you?

890
01:08:21,029 --> 01:08:23,865
I didn't even think about it.
It just sort of slipped out,

891
01:08:23,897 --> 01:08:26,968
because if she was home with me,
I wouldn't have a problem with it.

892
01:08:27,002 --> 01:08:28,971
But then I remembered
that you had them...

893
01:08:29,004 --> 01:08:30,606
David, this is new.

894
01:08:33,441 --> 01:08:34,877
This is my family, Niki.

895
01:08:37,044 --> 01:08:39,248
- I know.
- Do you?

896
01:08:43,051 --> 01:08:46,888
'Cause if you're not thinking
about this all the time,

897
01:08:46,920 --> 01:08:49,258
then you need
to cut me loose.

898
01:08:49,290 --> 01:08:52,227
Because I think about it
all fucking day.

899
01:08:55,429 --> 01:08:56,731
This is hard.

900
01:08:58,866 --> 01:09:01,736
So, if you can't find
some way to be considerate

901
01:09:01,770 --> 01:09:04,473
and we can't find a dialogue,
then you move out,

902
01:09:04,505 --> 01:09:06,275
and you take them
on the weekends,

903
01:09:06,307 --> 01:09:08,442
because I only agreed to do
this because you promised me

904
01:09:08,476 --> 01:09:10,512
that we were going to
work through this.

905
01:09:13,882 --> 01:09:16,685
This is hard enough being away from
you, but when I gotta...

906
01:09:16,718 --> 01:09:20,455
David, I'm sorry. Okay?
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

907
01:09:20,487 --> 01:09:24,392
Look at me. Look at me.
I fucked up, okay?

908
01:09:24,426 --> 01:09:27,329
I'm sorry. Okay?

909
01:09:27,361 --> 01:09:29,297
- [Derek] Everything okay out here?
- It's just hard.

910
01:09:30,932 --> 01:09:33,068
Yeah, we're fine.

911
01:09:33,101 --> 01:09:35,670
- I'm sorry, I didn't know you were coming back.
- You kidding me?

912
01:09:35,704 --> 01:09:37,839
I come pick up the kids,
and you're gonna have

913
01:09:37,871 --> 01:09:39,508
a fuck fest in my house
with this guy?

914
01:09:39,540 --> 01:09:41,476
David, that's not
what is going on, okay?

915
01:09:50,017 --> 01:09:51,453
[Derek] We all right here?

916
01:09:51,486 --> 01:09:52,921
- Yeah.
- Yeah, we're good.

917
01:09:52,954 --> 01:09:54,990
You sure? Really
doesn't sound like it.

918
01:09:55,022 --> 01:09:57,793
[chuckles] Just having a
conversation about our kids, man,

919
01:09:57,825 --> 01:10:00,395
so if you could just go somewhere,
take a walk or something, man,

920
01:10:00,428 --> 01:10:02,497
I'd really appreciate it.

921
01:10:02,530 --> 01:10:05,334
I think maybe I should be a part of
the conversation, don't you think?

922
01:10:05,366 --> 01:10:07,401
Uh... [chuckles] Are you
serious with this guy?

923
01:10:07,435 --> 01:10:08,870
Don't talk about me
like I'm not here.

924
01:10:08,902 --> 01:10:11,339
Then don't stand here
and try to have...

925
01:10:11,373 --> 01:10:13,642
- Like you have any value in this conversation.
- It's fine. We're fine.

926
01:10:13,674 --> 01:10:15,710
I'm fine. We're okay.
Just go in the house.

927
01:10:15,744 --> 01:10:18,880
I'm talking about our children,
our family, our marriage.

928
01:10:18,913 --> 01:10:20,749
So just
get out of here, man.

929
01:10:20,781 --> 01:10:22,016
I don't think so.

930
01:10:22,049 --> 01:10:23,584
Look, I think
maybe it's important

931
01:10:23,618 --> 01:10:25,087
that I be a part of it
at this point.

932
01:10:25,120 --> 01:10:26,922
[laughs]
It's not important.

933
01:10:26,954 --> 01:10:29,423
You have zero value
in this conversation.

934
01:10:29,456 --> 01:10:31,860
- Go somewhere...
- I don't appreciate how you're talking to my girlfriend.

935
01:10:31,892 --> 01:10:33,794
- Your girlfriend?
- Yes.

936
01:10:33,828 --> 01:10:35,763
- This is my wife. My wife!
- Okay, okay, okay.

937
01:10:35,797 --> 01:10:36,998
- You know what that means?
- Hey, hey!

938
01:10:37,030 --> 01:10:38,466
That is my house
you're staying in.

939
01:10:38,499 --> 01:10:40,134
- David, take a breath.
- Mine!

940
01:10:40,168 --> 01:10:41,837
- You understand that?
- Derek, let's go. Okay?

941
01:10:41,870 --> 01:10:43,739
You're a pathetic piece
of garbage.

942
01:10:43,771 --> 01:10:45,740
- You just prey on women...
- Okay, take a breath.

943
01:10:45,773 --> 01:10:48,377
You can't find single women
that you can hang out with?

944
01:10:48,410 --> 01:10:50,979
- Derek, just go in the house.
- You got no game? Huh?

945
01:10:51,012 --> 01:10:53,982
You gotta come round here, somebody's trying
to work through their marriage issues

946
01:10:54,014 --> 01:10:56,051
and swoop in on people
that are vulnerable?

947
01:10:56,084 --> 01:10:57,753
You're a fucking leech.

948
01:10:57,785 --> 01:10:59,687
You're a bottom feeder,
you piece of fucking shit.

949
01:10:59,721 --> 01:11:03,359
Take a breath, David.
Take a breath.

950
01:11:08,096 --> 01:11:09,798
Derek, come on,
just go in the house.

951
01:11:09,830 --> 01:11:11,600
[Derek] I'm sorry,
I can't at this point.

952
01:11:11,633 --> 01:11:14,136
If you give us a minute,
we could probably work this out.

953
01:11:14,169 --> 01:11:16,638
Derek, I promise you,
we don't need a minute.

954
01:11:16,670 --> 01:11:19,407
- That's the last thing we need.
- I'd appreciate it if you went inside, Niki.

955
01:11:19,441 --> 01:11:22,144
Dave, please just go.
Go. Okay?

956
01:11:22,177 --> 01:11:25,080
- You feel like a big dick standing in front of my house?
- Okay, stop.

957
01:11:25,112 --> 01:11:26,748
With my wife and kids?
You feel tough?

958
01:11:26,780 --> 01:11:28,048
David, get in your truck
and go.

959
01:11:28,081 --> 01:11:29,618
I'm not leaving
without the kids.

960
01:11:29,651 --> 01:11:31,153
Derek,
let's go in the house.

961
01:11:31,186 --> 01:11:32,987
So you and your
fucking boyfriend can do...

962
01:11:33,021 --> 01:11:35,424
David, get in your truck
and leave!

963
01:11:35,456 --> 01:11:37,892
I'm not leaving.
I'm waiting for the kids.

964
01:11:37,926 --> 01:11:39,727
Call Mrs. Thompson,
tell her to send the boys down.

965
01:11:39,761 --> 01:11:41,029
Tell Jess to grab her crap.
Let's go.

966
01:11:41,062 --> 01:11:42,464
You think
that's a good idea?

967
01:11:42,496 --> 01:11:44,031
It's happening.
[spits]

968
01:11:44,065 --> 01:11:46,034
I don't care if it's a
good idea or a bad idea.

969
01:11:46,066 --> 01:11:49,670
- David, I will bring them by in ten minutes.
- I'm not leaving.

970
01:11:49,704 --> 01:11:51,973
- Niki, give us a minute and everything will be fine.
- Derek, stop.

971
01:11:52,005 --> 01:11:53,842
We don't need a minute,
Derek.

972
01:11:53,874 --> 01:11:56,645
I can promise you the last thing
we need is a fucking minute.

973
01:11:56,678 --> 01:11:58,213
Go get Jesse
and the boys

974
01:11:58,245 --> 01:11:59,748
and by the time
you get back,

975
01:11:59,780 --> 01:12:01,549
we will have this
figured out.

976
01:12:05,887 --> 01:12:07,188
What do you say, dude?

977
01:12:07,222 --> 01:12:10,759
[laughs] I say you
can go fuck yourself.

978
01:12:14,195 --> 01:12:17,699
All right, wait, guys.
You know what, listen.

979
01:12:17,731 --> 01:12:21,202
I think this is... I think this is
getting a little crazy, all right?

980
01:12:21,236 --> 01:12:24,072
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. I apologize.

981
01:12:24,105 --> 01:12:25,507
That's not me.
You know that.

982
01:12:25,539 --> 01:12:27,176
David, you too, man.

983
01:12:28,642 --> 01:12:30,846
I'm sorry, all right?

984
01:12:30,879 --> 01:12:33,882
[chuckles]
I am new to this dynamic.

985
01:12:33,914 --> 01:12:36,217
I think that we all are.

986
01:12:36,250 --> 01:12:38,652
And I realize that
I am forcing myself in,

987
01:12:38,686 --> 01:12:41,156
but I think that that is
a natural thing to want to do

988
01:12:41,188 --> 01:12:43,624
with somebody that I care
about as much as her.

989
01:12:45,526 --> 01:12:49,864
Hey, my man. Right here.
Look. No disrespect, okay?

990
01:12:49,897 --> 01:12:52,601
I get that I got
in the middle of something.

991
01:12:53,167 --> 01:12:55,003
[scoffs]

992
01:12:58,972 --> 01:13:01,208
This thing got nothing
to do with you, buddy.

993
01:13:01,241 --> 01:13:04,779
It's much bigger than you.
You need to get the heck out of here.

994
01:13:04,812 --> 01:13:06,281
- He doesn't listen.
- It doesn't matter.

995
01:13:06,313 --> 01:13:08,583
David and I need to talk about
this, figure it out.

996
01:13:08,615 --> 01:13:09,984
If I'm gonna be here
for any length of time,

997
01:13:10,017 --> 01:13:12,087
we need to start off
on the right foot.

998
01:13:12,120 --> 01:13:14,789
[sighs] I promise, we don't need to
start off on the right foot, okay?

999
01:13:14,821 --> 01:13:17,525
We'll get there, okay?
Just go get Jesse and the boys

1000
01:13:17,558 --> 01:13:19,093
and by the time
you get them back here,

1001
01:13:19,127 --> 01:13:21,663
me and him, we will work this
out, I promise you that.

1002
01:13:21,695 --> 01:13:22,963
That okay with you,
David?

1003
01:13:22,996 --> 01:13:25,100
Whatever gets the kids
in the truck,

1004
01:13:25,133 --> 01:13:26,701
I'm so happy with.

1005
01:13:26,734 --> 01:13:28,703
Cool. Okay.
You can call...

1006
01:13:28,736 --> 01:13:30,305
Niki can call,
she can stop by your dad's later,

1007
01:13:30,338 --> 01:13:31,940
and you guys
can work your thing out...

1008
01:13:31,972 --> 01:13:34,241
I don't care what she does.
Just get the kids.

1009
01:13:34,275 --> 01:13:36,111
I mean, what is it,
100 yards?

1010
01:13:36,143 --> 01:13:38,079
You can go by later.

1011
01:13:38,111 --> 01:13:40,581
You guys can work your thing
out after we work our thing out.

1012
01:13:40,615 --> 01:13:42,584
- I'm sorry.
- Don't be sorry. It's okay.

1013
01:13:42,616 --> 01:13:44,218
This sort of thing happens.

1014
01:14:01,369 --> 01:14:03,804
I don't know,
what did you hope to accomplish?

1015
01:14:03,838 --> 01:14:04,907
No, I know.

1016
01:14:07,174 --> 01:14:10,110
[both grunting]

1017
01:14:10,143 --> 01:14:11,980
[David groaning]

1018
01:14:13,047 --> 01:14:16,351
I'm a piece of garbage, huh?
Is that right?

1019
01:14:16,383 --> 01:14:18,719
You are a pile of garbage,
David.

1020
01:14:20,922 --> 01:14:22,657
You don't deserve that woman.

1021
01:14:36,904 --> 01:14:38,240
[David groaning]

1022
01:14:43,945 --> 01:14:46,114
[breathing heavily]

1023
01:15:16,244 --> 01:15:18,080
[engine starts]

1024
01:15:35,295 --> 01:15:37,865
David! David!

1025

Hey, don't touch
unless we bought it.

1043
01:19:48,014 --> 01:19:49,984
- With your eyes, not your hands.
- [boy] Can we buy 'em?

- Hey, babe?
- No, we can't buy 'em.

- Huh?
- What do you think of these?

1046
01:19:54,454 --> 01:19:56,023
What's wrong with
the ones we got?

1047
01:19:56,057 --> 01:19:58,226
Nothing.
It's just, these are smart.

1048
01:19:58,258 --> 01:19:59,593
It's an upgrade.

1049

1050

[man] Can I help you guys
with anything?

1051
01:20:04,298 --> 01:20:06,267
Just looking
at your washers.

1052
01:20:06,299 --> 01:20:08,468
I was telling my husband
everything's moving to smart now.

1053
01:20:08,502 --> 01:20:10,638
That's very much true.

1054
01:20:10,670 --> 01:20:12,606
Can you tell him
what that means?

1055
01:20:12,639 --> 01:20:14,008
Yeah, definitely.

1056
01:20:14,040 --> 01:20:15,976
Uh, well,
this specific machine,

1057
01:20:16,009 --> 01:20:18,079
it's got a weight sensor
in the washer

1058
01:20:18,111 --> 01:20:19,614
so it can tell
how big the load is,

1059
01:20:19,646 --> 01:20:21,248
and then it can use that
to decide

1060
01:20:21,281 --> 01:20:24,151
how much liquid soap
to put in for the best clean.

1061
01:20:24,185 --> 01:20:25,986
But I thought
that's what that little...

1062
01:20:26,020 --> 01:20:27,722
Like, the little cup that
goes at the top of the...

1063
01:20:27,754 --> 01:20:30,157
Oh, yeah, of course.
But this way, you can just load the soap

1064
01:20:30,191 --> 01:20:33,394
and you don't have to worry about
putting the soap in yourself.

1065
01:20:33,427 --> 01:20:35,330
The coolest thing
about this one, though,

1066
01:20:35,362 --> 01:20:37,432
is that it will send you a
text when the wash is done,

1067
01:20:37,464 --> 01:20:39,266
so you can stay
on top of your laundry.

1068
01:20:39,299 --> 01:20:41,034
I imagine
with all these kids,

1069
01:20:41,067 --> 01:20:42,669
you're always
just juggling that.

1070
01:20:42,703 --> 01:20:45,505
- Never ends.
- Yeah.

1071
01:20:45,539 --> 01:20:47,642
Well, did you have any more
questions about this one?

1072
01:20:47,674 --> 01:20:49,343
Could it fit him in it?

1073
01:20:49,377 --> 01:20:52,347
Yeah, probably.
This is an extra big, extra large.

1074
01:20:57,517 --> 01:20:58,986
Get him!
