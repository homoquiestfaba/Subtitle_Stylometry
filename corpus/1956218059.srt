001
00:25:10,756 --> 00:25:13,276
The train woke me up again.

002
00:25:13,300 --> 00:25:15,070
I can't sleep.

003
00:25:15,094 --> 00:25:18,156
Go back to bed, baby.

004
00:25:18,180 --> 00:25:36,057
I'll be back.

005
00:25:55,384 --> 00:26:00,240
Do you want to go
somewhere else for a few days?

006
00:26:00,264 --> 00:26:02,367
Let the kid get a good night of sleep.

007
00:26:02,391 --> 00:26:12,002
You pay me for sex.
My regular life is not for sale.

008
00:26:12,026 --> 00:26:16,297
How much for two nights?

009
00:26:16,321 --> 00:26:18,591
He's not your kid.

010
00:26:18,615 --> 00:26:22,303
I know.

011
00:26:22,327 --> 00:26:31,021
How much?

012
00:26:31,045 --> 00:26:34,273
Excuse me.

013
00:26:34,297 --> 00:26:36,860
Hotel service.

014
00:26:36,884 --> 00:26:38,403
Madam.

015
00:26:38,427 --> 00:26:40,030
Yes.

016
00:26:40,054 --> 00:26:44,409
Yes, I'll call maintenance right away.

017
00:26:44,433 --> 00:27:02,260
Thank you so much.

018
00:27:02,284 --> 00:27:05,388
A woman and her son
are locked inside.

019
00:27:05,412 --> 00:27:10,351
These doors have high security deadlocks
for our VIP guests.

020
00:27:10,375 --> 00:27:14,689
We can't release it from the outside.

021
00:27:14,713 --> 00:27:17,025
I have to drill it.

022
00:27:17,049 --> 00:27:31,498
Okay, but try to keep it down.

023
00:27:31,522 --> 00:27:32,665
Speak!

024
00:27:32,689 --> 00:27:34,918
No fucking way!

025
00:27:34,942 --> 00:27:38,630
Yes, you said that two days ago.

026
00:27:38,654 --> 00:27:41,841
When the fuck is he coming?

027
00:27:41,865 --> 00:27:45,095
What is that fucking sound?

028
00:27:45,119 --> 00:27:47,680
Shit!

029
00:27:47,704 --> 00:27:50,183
What is that fucking sound?

030
00:27:50,207 --> 00:27:51,309
What the hell is this?

031
00:27:51,333 --> 00:27:53,144
You know we are in here!

032
00:27:53,168 --> 00:27:54,938
We are so sorry, sir.

033
00:27:54,962 --> 00:27:55,897
What?

034
00:27:55,921 --> 00:27:57,190
We're just...

035
00:27:57,214 --> 00:28:14,465
-Sir!
-Hey, dumbass!

036
00:28:42,676 --> 00:28:47,782
Sit down.

037
00:28:47,806 --> 00:28:52,162
Be quiet.

038
00:28:52,186 --> 00:28:54,581
I need some answers.

039
00:28:54,605 --> 00:28:57,375
-Nod if you understand.

040
00:28:57,399 --> 00:28:59,627
I was sent to kill you.

041
00:28:59,651 --> 00:29:03,256
But it looks
like I'm the target here, right?

042
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:04,257
Yes.

043
00:29:04,281 --> 00:29:06,634
Do you know who ordered this?

044
00:29:06,658 --> 00:29:11,973
I don't know anything.

045
00:29:11,997 --> 00:29:13,183
I don't know anything.

046
00:29:13,207 --> 00:29:16,644
I need to make sure
you're telling me the truth.

047
00:29:16,668 --> 00:29:19,480
I'm not lying!

048
00:29:19,504 --> 00:29:23,902
I swear!

049
00:29:23,926 --> 00:29:28,489
I'm not lying!

050
00:29:28,513 --> 00:29:46,557
-Are you sure?
-Yes.

051
00:30:48,010 --> 00:30:59,080
Let's go.

052
00:30:59,104 --> 00:31:09,215
Come on, let's go. Don't look.

053
00:31:09,239 --> 00:31:27,199
Somebody call the police!

054
00:31:29,092 --> 00:31:35,742
You make all this money
from killing people?

045
00:31:35,766 --> 00:31:42,749
We could have been killed up there.

046
00:31:42,773 --> 00:31:44,000
One day...

047
00:31:44,024 --> 00:31:48,171
even you will get killed.

048
00:31:48,195 --> 00:32:05,905
Don't come near me again.
