1
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:29,720
Captain Cage.

2
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:31,800
Captain Cage.

3
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:07,280
24 hours ago one of the engineers
on ice station Aerobis went postal on us.

4
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:10,320
Right now it looks like we got at
least one confirmed dead.

5
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:12,840
Sounds like a semper fi detail to me.

6
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:15,920
The Antarctica is demilitarized, Sam.

7
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:18,960
As far as the marines are concerned,
Aerobis doesn't exist.

8
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:22,280
OK so what is this IJS station anyway?

9
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:25,400
Officially it's a research facility
run by the army corps engineers.

10
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:26,920
And unofficially?

11
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:30,000
It's an illegal mining operation,
courtesy of the pentagon.

12
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:37,880
Now, there are - were - six soldiers
at Aerobis

13
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:42,720
Whitaker, the commander, Jennifer Wills,
Medical, Tech ??? Shebanski, Geologist Ronald
Reynolds and Baines, a mining engineer.

14
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:46,320
That's five.

15
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:50,480
And the director of operations makes
6, Dr Carl Schilling

16
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:52,400
He's the shooter.

17
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,520
Where the hell did this weather come from?

18
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:05,440
No way I'm gonna be able to go
down in this.

19
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:07,760
Just get us as close as we
can and we'll drop.

20
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:09,040
Yes Major.

21
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:24,880
Now or never, Major.

22
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:24,720
Hang on, we're too high.
-We don't have a choice!

23
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:30,040
Okay, drop.

24
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:40,280
OK. Are you alright?
yeah, let's go!

25
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:49,680
Base is that way.

26
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:19,760
Whitaker! Major Frank.

27
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:27,440
The commanding officer!
Come on, we gotta move!

28
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:23,280
Don't move!

29
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:25,440
Do not shoot!

30
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:27,280
Hold your fire!

31
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:29,040
Drop the gun.

32
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:31,600
We are here to help. Now throw
your gun out!

33
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:33,720
I don't wanna call for help,
who are you ?

34
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:37,480
Major Carrie O'Gardy and Captain Sam Cage,
military police.

35
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:38,840
Drop it!

36
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:42,240
Throw your gun out, and
put your hands where we can see em!

37
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:47,000
Alright. Alright, here is the gun.

38
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,680
I'm coming out.

39
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:05,400
Jennifer Wills, medical officer.

40
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,800
I thought one of you could have been
Schilling!

41
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,760
Where are the others?

42
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:17,400
I don't now. As far as I know,
it's just tech officer Shebanski and me.

43
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:19,320
Where is Shebanski?

44
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:25,000
I do not know. Dug himself a hole back
there I guess.

45
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,840
Well let's dig him out.

46
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:40,200
Do you always keep it this dark
down here?

47
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:44,440
Well we run mostly on solar so this time of
year we have to work with what we got.

48
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:10,360
Captain John Baines.
Mining engineer.

49
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:14,360
How did he end up in here?
I found him outside frozen solid.

50
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:16,400
All I could do is just drag him in.

51
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:24,520
Knife.
Guy likes to get close.

52
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:54,720
What is it?

53
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:57,360
Nothing.
Let's go!

54
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:10,480
This is Dr Schillings room.

55
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:28,880
It's OK, it's Shebanski!
They are the MP's.

56
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:32,720
Well it took you guys long enough.
I want to get the hell of this iceberg.

57
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:42,600
If you guys are waiting for hell to freeze
over, you're a little bit late. Now come on,
let's GO!

58
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:44,880
Not until we find the others and
clean this up.

59
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:48,240
You don't understand. We gotta get out
of here like NOW!

60
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:52,520
Where is the transport dammit? There are
only a few minutes left before it gets dark.

61
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:57,920
Now where is the transport?
- We dropped in.

62
00:12:58,760 --> 00:12:59,760
Great.

63
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:02,360
Look, nobody else is gonna die,
nobody here at least.

64
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:05,880
So the sooner you tell us what happened,
the sooner we can do our job and get you
out of here.

65
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:10,320
You can do whatever the hell you want,
alright, I'm gonna go radio for
transport now.

66
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:14,720
You can try, but nobody is
gonna fly in here during this storm

67
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:19,960
not to mention this is a restricted area
now, and unless one of us gives the base
the correct code they won't send shit.

68
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:24,400
So why on't we just start from top,
OK folks?

69
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:58,520
So Whitaker ordered level 6 of the mine,
that's the deepest level, sealed off.

70
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:02,960
On account of the gases. -There was a sudden
increase concentration of sulfur and carbon monoxide.

71
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:07,360
Yeah but Schilling decided to go down there
anyways. Suddenly he's reporting back.

72
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:12,080
He's found something down there,
but he won't tell anybody, hat it is.

73
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:15,280
When was this?
Yesterday early.

74
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:20,400
So next thing we know, Schilling is back
up from the mines and he got this huge
knife in his hand

75
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:25,680
walking, into Major Whitaker's office, the last
thing I saw was Bings, I guess

76
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:28,720
he was trying to go in there to help
Major Whitaker

77
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:32,960
Why was that the last thing that you saw?
Cause I didn't wanna get in nobodies way
if you know what I mean.

78
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:35,400
Yeah well we found Whitaker's body
on the way in.

79
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:38,320
Let's go get him.
-Whoa whoa whoa sit down

80
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:42,720
He's not going anywhere, that just leaves
Reynolds, do you have any idea where he is?

81
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:45,800
You guys are the secret police, how about
you tell us?

82
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:52,360
We gotta get out of here, now.

83
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:55,400
Talk about your cabin fever.

84
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:58,040
The way I see it, there's only two real
questions here.

85
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:01,680
Is the geologist Ronald Reynolds still
alive and where is Schilling?

86
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:05,000
How do you wanna proceed?
-We radio our status and we check
out the mine (bad idea)

87
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:12,760
Where are the gas masks?
- Schilling took em.

88
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:16,120
Only 20 minutes of daylight left
- Exactly how we like it, short and sweet.

89
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:18,920
You don't wanna be out there
when the temperature drops.

90
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:21,000
Yeah we'll keep that in mind.

91
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:29,200
Are you ready?
- Yeah, let's go.

92
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:37,800
Are you with me?
- Yeah, let's go.

93
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:45,560
Stop!

94
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:57,800
Damn, I lost him.

95
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:01,680
Jesus I need air!

96
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:09,360
Come on. Hold it together, let's go.
Any ideas?

97
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:13,160
Shit. Let's try that way.

98
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:25,520
Dead end!

99
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:51,040
These goddamn fumes.

100
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:56,800
Doesn't seem to bother you at all.

101
00:18:57,040 --> 00:18:59,240
???

102
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:03,400
It's not just me, it's hot, right?

103
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:05,800
We gotta get you out of here.
Here, put your arm around me let's go.

104
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:16,480
How the hell do we get out of here?

105
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:26,160
???
This is 4, what's going on?

106
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,520
What happened to her?

107
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:43,760
Gases.
- Put her here.

108
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:48,240
Did you find anybody?
-No.

109
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:53,200
Look at me.

110
00:19:58,520 --> 00:20:00,320
I'll be fine.

111
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,200
How is she?
-Well, heart rate's a little high

112
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:07,080
...but I think she'll be OK.
You just need some rest.

113
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:09,200
I said I'll be fine.

114
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:12,920
??? We're gonna need a map.
-Maps? Hold on.

115
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:22,600
Damn.

116
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,440
Schilling must have em.
Don't look at us either.

117
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:30,800
Neither of us have been down there
before.

118
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:34,280
Alright look, I think we should all try
to get some rest.

119
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:37,880
Thanks.
I want you two armed.

120
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:40,840
From now on we all stay together,
understood?

121
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:43,280
Oh gee I thought I'd go out and take a
walk in the snow.

122
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:45,280
Yeah keep up that attitude and
we'll let ya.

123
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:49,760
I'll take the first watch
I feel to shitty too sleep.

124
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:52,000
Are you sure?
- Good night, Captain.

125
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:55,440
What is going on?

126
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:03,200
Solar power is depleted.
There it goes.

127
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:05,440
Backup generator is kicking in.

128
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:08,920
We're gonna have to conserve as much fuel
as possible. ??? we'll freeze.

129
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:10,600
How long do we have?
-I don't know the guy in power

130
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:13,760
is defrosting down the hall.

131
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:13,880
It's nothing. The wind must have
knocked over an aerial.

132
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:18,600
Look, if it makes you more comfortable
we will check it out.

133
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:23,160
Are you kidding? It's at least 70 below
out there.

134
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:25,640
Nothing can survive! Nothing!
-Nothing living.

135
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:32,160
Alright you tell me what it is.
-I don't know what it is and I never
wanna find out, alright?

136
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:34,080
Then stow it, lieutenant.

137
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:36,640
Besides, Jennifer is right.
Nothing could survive out there, so.

138
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:42,320
Damned aerial.

139
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:51,640
You saw something, didn't you?
-I didn't see anything.

140
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:53,400
Yeah, right.

141
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,680
What did you see?
- Nothing. Shadows.

142
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:06,640
Sure?
- Yeah.

143
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:10,160
Try to get some sleep,
I'll wake you in two hours.

144
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:21,880
He's gone.

145
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:26,800
Who?
- Baines.

146
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:33,160
Last time I checked on Baines was
just before we went into the mine.

147
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:42,840
Shebanski, wanna face me, please?
-What? -Put your hands up.

148
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:46,040
What? I was watching the monitor, OK?

149
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:49,160
If you don't believe me,
ask her.

150
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:52,440
He was. The whole time.
-You two go back to bed. The captain
will join you in a second.

151
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:02,520
Somebody apparently has a backstage
pass around here.

152
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:05,440
Which means either Schilling has a
partner in crime -Or else?

153
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:08,640
Or these two are fucking with us.

154
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:13,960
Maybe Shebanski thinks that if he hides
Baines body he'll spook us into calling
the transport.

155
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:04,560
Callie?

156
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:35,360
Callie.

157
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:47,920
What is it?

158
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:52,680
Callie.
Where's Callie?

159
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:10,320
Someones on level five.

160
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:23,280
It's 60 below out there,
you'll freeze.

161
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:25,760
If he can survive out there,
so can I.

162
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:47,240
God dammit!

163
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:01,800
Come on.

164
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,600


165
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:16,800
Come on!

166
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:24,960
What?

167
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:29,320
I'm sorry.

168
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:31,440
Maybe now you're gonna call for backup?

169
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:33,720
What do you think it is
now the right time?

170
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:37,800
Shut up.
Shut your fucking mouth!

171
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:53,200
Alright. The radio.

172
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:15,240
You don't think I did this do ya?

173
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:18,160
They must have done this when
they took your partner.

174
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:20,560
How many phantoms do you have here?

175
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:25,200
The army had us here for a year doing
nothing and I lost perspective.

176
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:30,000
Let me put things in perspective for you.
Fix the fucking radio!

177
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:34,840
Calm down.
It is not your fault.

178
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:38,840
She trusted me.

179
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:08,600
I'm sorry.

180
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:41,720
Lock this door.

181
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:05,720
Robert Reynolds?

182
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:08,720
Bring him!
- What?

183
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:11,240
Just bring him! Now!

184
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:14,600
Alright... got him.

185
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:18,600
Okay the warming blanket is on.

186
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:21,080
Dead is dead Doc.
-What?

187
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:23,040
Dead is dead.

188
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:26,200
Look, he's got a chance,
I felt a pulse.

189
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:30,000
So if we can warm his body, and if
his heart can take it, then maybe we
can save him.

190
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:32,200
Now can you get some blankets, please.

191
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:35,360
Alright now what?
- OK, erm monitor his temperature for me.

192
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:39,000
You know how to do that?
-Yes, stick it in his ear. -Right.
-Push the blue button.

193
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:43,840
Alright, 89.5 degrees. -Great.
89.9.

194
00:33:44,040 --> 00:33:46,040
Here they are.
-Put them on.

195
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:48,880
90.2.

196
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:51,400
You can do it, Bobby.

197
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:56,880
???
-90.7 degrees.

198
00:33:57,080 --> 00:34:00,320
Now what?
- We'll wait.

199
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:03,720
Doctor, is erm, is that normal?

200
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:05,800
What?
- That.

201
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:12,800
OK, OK, it's just ???

202
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:16,720
??? you got it.
Hold him.

203
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:22,240
OK, he's stabilizing.
-Is he gonna live?

204
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:25,600
Yeah, for the moment.

205
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:28,800
Brain damage, that's another question.

206
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:32,160
Well congratulations I guess.

207
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:36,760
But if it was him that was in the mine,
believe me he's gonna wish that he'd stayed
frozen.

208
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:40,560
Now you both have guns. Keep an eye on
captain frosty here, I'm gonna

209
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:43,400
secure the
perimeter.

210
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:23,320
FOR MARY, 1916

211
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:34,560
That's how you secure a perimeter?
-Well you work with what you've got.

212
00:35:36,120 --> 00:35:37,840
Can you give me a minute?

213
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:59,160
How many hours till daylight?
-Two.

214
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:02,600
Are you OK?

215
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:06,280
Yeah, I just hate this waiting shit.

216
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:10,240
You're a good man, Sam.

217
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:13,160
... Callie was lucky
to have you as a partner.

218
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:16,040
You don't know me, I'm not good
at all.

219
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:18,760
Yeah you are.

220
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:23,080
You're just doing a damn good job of
fighting it.

221
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:27,240
Don't worry you're secret is safe with
me, though.

222
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:32,320
What?

223
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:37,560
It's not my good tide that
I'm fighting.

224
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:50,880
Bobby!
Bobby, it's okay.

225
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:52,440
Hold him.

226
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:54,400
Hold him.
- I got him!

227
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:56,280
I'll get ???.

228
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:58,320
What's going on down here?

229
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:03,880
Come on.

230
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:06,160
Bobby.

231
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:12,200
What's going on?

232
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:14,240
Nothing, just get back there and fix
the radio.

233
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:16,840
It's toast! I can't do
anything.

234
00:37:23,080 --> 00:37:24,720
How are we gonna get out of here,
then?

235
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:28,280
Ask Mr. Big Stuff. He's the ashole who
wouldn't let us use the radio when we
wanted to, now we need to

236
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:30,040
and can't because it's busted.

237
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:32,800
Shut up.
I say we can get out of here and
we will.

238
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:42,720
Alright look, it's standard operating
procedure for the base to send in
the cavalry if they don't hear from us.

239
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:47,360
But we can't count on that in that weather
besides we don't know what Schilling has in
store for us so..

240
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:50,440
Go ahead and find alright nobody is
stopping you go ahead and find Schilling.

241
00:37:50,680 --> 00:37:53,760
That's exactly what I intend to do we're
gonna flush him out at daylight.

242
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:55,400
You and me what do you mean "we"?

243
00:37:55,880 --> 00:37:57,680
That's right you and me.

244
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:02,200
I'm not fucking going in that mine I
never been down there before so

245
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:04,400
I'm not going down there I'm not I'm not.

246
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:07,480
That's an order, lieutenant.

247
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:37,320
Just calm down.

248
00:38:43,640 --> 00:38:45,000
Hellooo, little brother.

249
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:56,520
Have you seen Mary?

250
00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:03,640
Sick son of a bitch!

251
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:10,600
Hold your fire!

252
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:13,760
Stop shooting you idiot!
-Alright I stopped I stopped!

253
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:22,120
OK I think we got him trapped don't
move! -???

254
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:24,800
Just stay there!

255
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:37,800
God dammit, I told you to stay put!

256
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,800
I'm sorry.

257
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:45,880
You saw him come in here, right?
-Saw who?

258
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:49,320
Is there any other way out of this room?
-No.

259
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:52,200
Wait, there's a disposal unit.

260
00:39:59,120 --> 00:40:03,320
Maybe that explains the noise.
But I still didn't see anybody come in here.

261
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:05,800
That explains everything.
Lock.

262
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:25,560
Sam listen I think those gases might have
affected you a little more than you think.

263
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:29,760
So here. Why don't you let me give you
something. It will help you sleep.

264
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:32,120
Shut up I don't need to sleep.

265
00:40:35,120 --> 00:40:38,200
Fine.
I was just trying to help.

266
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:40,960
Well I don't need you goddamned
help.

267
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:44,440
I just need to think.

268
00:40:50,120 --> 00:40:53,520
OK.. OK maybe that's what happened to
Schilling he sucked to much gas.

269
00:40:53,720 --> 00:40:55,920
What are you talking about?

270
00:40:56,120 --> 00:41:00,760
First you got a downed aerial then
the disposal unit now it's a mystery gas.

271
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:05,120
You can rationalize this anyway you like,
the bottom line is: we're all fucked!!!

272
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:10,680
Somebody and I'm talking about more than
one person is moving bodies around this
place!

273
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:12,840
And who cares why?

274
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:15,600
Because we're all gonna be dead,
if we don't get out of here soon.

275
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:18,360
OK then maybe Schilling isn't working alone.

276
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:22,200
Maybe that's right. Maybe this place is
so hush hush that maybe it's the fucking

277
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:26,880
Iraqis, that they are after whatever it is
Schilling found so

278
00:41:27,080 --> 00:41:29,520
it's not the aerial and maybe it's not
the gases.

279
00:41:29,720 --> 00:41:31,040
Sam, why would they...

280
00:41:31,240 --> 00:41:34,720
-Because we can't just go around reporting
this to anybody they know that. It would
blow the whole goddamn thing!

281
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:39,560
If they wanted us to leave, why would
they trash the radio?

282
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:42,600
I don't know maybe they want us all dead.

283
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:44,840
None of us are here officially.

284
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:48,640
They know that our country would just
sweep us under the rug.

285
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:50,440
As long as we're all going nuts around
here,

286
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:54,520
let's say you weren't send down
here to solve any murders.

287
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:59,120
What if I said that, I mean hypothetically,
that you're part of this whole cover up?

288
00:41:59,560 --> 00:42:02,640
In fact you're down here, to sweep us under
the rug aren't ya?

289
00:42:02,840 --> 00:42:05,760
Cause that is what he's here for, he's here
to fuck with us.

290
00:42:06,680 --> 00:42:09,600
I am down here to save you sorry little
pathetic ass!

291
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:14,040
You couldn't save anyone.

292
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:20,840
I can sure as hell shut you up.

293
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:24,000
That's enough!

294
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:39,720
What is it, Bobby?

295
00:42:41,480 --> 00:42:43,720
It's coming.

296
00:42:44,040 --> 00:42:47,280
Can't stop him.
-I'm not gonna listen to this.

297
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:53,200
The dead will walk ...
to destroy this place.

298
00:42:53,600 --> 00:42:55,720
He's out of his fucking mind.

299
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:57,960
You're seeing things and he's out of his
mind?

300
00:42:58,200 --> 00:43:00,720
Oh the dead can walk? Give me
a fucking break!

301
00:43:00,920 --> 00:43:02,400
Well have you seen Baines lately?

302
00:43:04,920 --> 00:43:06,480
Callie.

303
00:43:16,280 --> 00:43:18,320
Oh, Callie.

304
00:43:33,720 --> 00:43:36,400
Sam, someones been in Schiling's
room.

305
00:44:01,160 --> 00:44:05,640
Ben Cormain, Jim Norman,
??? Rock California, John Porter ...

306
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:10,760
Who are they?
-Beats the crap out of me.

307
00:44:13,960 --> 00:44:16,400
That's him.
That's Schilling.

308
00:44:27,600 --> 00:44:29,920
I think there is something that
you should know.

309
00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:32,240
Schilling is my half brother.

310
00:44:34,320 --> 00:44:36,600
Please, just stop it.

311
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:40,800
Just stop and stay.

312
00:44:42,600 --> 00:44:44,480
Come sit down please.

313
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:47,280
Sit down.

314
00:44:50,520 --> 00:44:52,960
We have the same father. Or so I'm told.

315
00:44:53,160 --> 00:44:55,520
I have never met my father.

316
00:44:55,720 --> 00:44:58,640
My brother and I are not close.

317
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:02,320
So what happened ?

318
00:45:06,120 --> 00:45:08,280
We were in the war together.

319
00:45:08,600 --> 00:45:13,800
There was a lot of killing, and
we lived like animals.

320
00:45:16,240 --> 00:45:20,440
But then I met a nurse.

321
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:25,160
Named Mary.

322
00:45:25,360 --> 00:45:28,720
And we fell in love and it all
happened so fast ...

323
00:45:28,920 --> 00:45:33,280
... I was consumed by her she she was so
beautiful.

324
00:45:33,680 --> 00:45:37,640
And three days before she was to be
shipped back home ...

325
00:45:38,600 --> 00:45:41,080
... I knew it was now or never.

326
00:45:41,320 --> 00:45:44,000
And so we agreed to be married the
next day.

327
00:45:48,440 --> 00:45:51,600
Karl... I should have known better

328
00:45:52,440 --> 00:45:57,600
I should have known that all he
would have done ...

329
00:45:58,040 --> 00:46:00,760
... he used to be around her all the
time

330
00:46:01,640 --> 00:46:04,360
He took her from me.

331
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:08,920
And I didn't have the courage to stop
him.

332
00:46:15,360 --> 00:46:17,200
I'm sorry.

333
00:46:17,640 --> 00:46:21,760
Please, don't. I don't deserve your
pity.

334
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:37,600
So what does Schilling want with us, then?
-Nothing good.

335
00:46:45,560 --> 00:46:47,480
What?

336
00:46:48,840 --> 00:46:52,400
These four points make the size of a
larger pentagram but ...

337
00:46:54,240 --> 00:46:57,680
...the last point being here ...
Aerobis.

338
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:06,880
What is that ?
-It's a book.

339
00:47:07,640 --> 00:47:10,840
'Raising Demons'.
Bullshit.

340
00:47:39,640 --> 00:47:42,280
Put Baines in Schillings room.

341
00:48:00,280 --> 00:48:03,320
So who needs a gas mask
when you got a genius, right?

342
00:48:05,520 --> 00:48:06,920
Let's go lieutenant.

343
00:48:07,120 --> 00:48:09,480
I'll be right there just give
me one more second.

344
00:48:20,120 --> 00:48:21,560
Time's up.

345
00:48:22,920 --> 00:48:26,600
I told you I wasn't going down there.
Captain meet the tunnel hound.

346
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:30,200
And I told you that we're blowing
the mine level by level until
we flush him out.

347
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:33,360
At least this way you gonna see what you
gonna nuke before you gonna nuke it.

348
00:48:33,600 --> 00:48:36,240
After all this is the modern army.
Isn't it?

349
00:49:25,520 --> 00:49:28,200
OK go.

350
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:36,080
Well?
-OK, I'm switching to the tunnel cam.

351
00:49:42,360 --> 00:49:44,320
It works.

352
00:50:17,960 --> 00:50:19,840
Where is all this light coming from?

353
00:50:20,040 --> 00:50:21,720
Phosphorus, maybe?

354
00:50:23,640 --> 00:50:26,240
No it's something stronger.
Keep going. -Okay.

355
00:50:31,240 --> 00:50:32,840
Damn.

356
00:50:34,480 --> 00:50:37,640
I said keep going.
-I'm stuck goddammit hold on.

357
00:50:38,200 --> 00:50:41,680
Can you...?
-What? Go down and move the rock?
I don't think so.

358
00:50:43,400 --> 00:50:45,960
Wait.
Here we go.

359
00:50:48,320 --> 00:50:51,200
Careful.
-Careful. Maybe I should write that down.

360
00:50:55,080 --> 00:50:57,760
Can't go any further.
-Drop it in.

361
00:50:57,960 --> 00:51:01,280
What? And smash my baby to
smithereens? -Do it.

362
00:51:02,120 --> 00:51:04,840
Yeah but we're gonna lose the signal.
-Just do it. -Yes Sir.

363
00:51:10,880 --> 00:51:12,480
Oh damn!

364
00:51:14,880 --> 00:51:17,080
Wait  a minute, wait a minute.
It's coming back.

365
00:51:17,440 --> 00:51:19,480
We got a picture again.

366
00:51:20,320 --> 00:51:21,760
Here we go.

367
00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:24,320
Looks like I lost the headlight, though.

368
00:51:24,520 --> 00:51:27,360
Can you move it?
-Yeah I can try. Hold on.

369
00:51:30,240 --> 00:51:31,800
Keep on moving towards the light.

370
00:51:32,080 --> 00:51:35,720
Follow the light, Carol Ann.
Follow the light.

371
00:51:39,120 --> 00:51:40,560
What is that?

372
00:51:40,760 --> 00:51:42,360
I couldn't tell you.

373
00:51:53,720 --> 00:51:55,520
Keep moving.

374
00:51:58,560 --> 00:52:00,400
What the hell was that?

375
00:52:03,800 --> 00:52:07,560
Is there something you can do about
that? -Battery.

376
00:52:17,520 --> 00:52:20,640
Looks like an altar.
-That must be what Schilling found.

377
00:52:20,880 --> 00:52:22,560
An altar?

378
00:52:28,160 --> 00:52:30,240
You see, right there?

379
00:52:30,840 --> 00:52:32,960
Look familiar?

380
00:52:33,400 --> 00:52:35,040
Pentacle.

381
00:52:35,440 --> 00:52:38,120
Can you get closer?
-I can try.

382
00:52:42,240 --> 00:52:43,800
Oh my God.

383
00:52:46,920 --> 00:52:48,720
Goddammit!

384
00:52:51,400 --> 00:52:53,000
What are you doing?

385
00:52:53,200 --> 00:52:56,320
Sam, you can't go down there.
She's dead!

386
00:52:56,520 --> 00:52:58,200
Move!

387
00:52:58,520 --> 00:53:01,760
Sam, it's a trap.
He wants you to go down there.

388
00:53:02,200 --> 00:53:03,840
Open the door.

389
00:53:04,080 --> 00:53:06,360
Sam, if you leave us here alone, we
are dead!

390
00:53:06,560 --> 00:53:07,920
Open the door!

391
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:19,560
You know I'm right.

392
00:53:20,160 --> 00:53:24,040
OK, we'll let him come to us then.

393
00:53:39,160 --> 00:53:42,880
Maybe we should think about this first?
Yeah, go ahead, think about it all you want.

394
00:53:43,240 --> 00:53:46,160
Reynolds, Baines and Whitaker probably
thought a lot, too.

395
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:49,680
??? airlock doors.

396
00:53:53,840 --> 00:53:57,000
Looks like Bobby's been here
trying to help us open these front doors.

397
00:53:58,880 --> 00:54:01,000
Let me go. Let me go!

398
00:54:01,240 --> 00:54:03,840
This is Bobby.
He's my responsibility.

399
00:54:04,040 --> 00:54:06,640
He's gone Jennifer. They got him.

400
00:54:09,040 --> 00:54:10,560
Who?

401
00:54:11,560 --> 00:54:13,120
Who's got him?

402
00:54:13,760 --> 00:54:16,720
Who? Schilling?
Devil worshipers? Is that it?

403
00:54:18,840 --> 00:54:22,040
What if they... they're gonna kill us
next. Is that it?

404
00:54:25,240 --> 00:54:28,720
Oh well why not? They got Whitaker.
Whitaker's dead.

405
00:54:28,920 --> 00:54:32,360
They got Baines, Baines is dead.
Well. I thought he was dead but he really
wasn't dead.

406
00:54:33,360 --> 00:54:34,920
Callie is dead.

407
00:54:35,160 --> 00:54:38,160
Now you're telling me Bobby's dead, too
is that what you're saying to me?

408
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:42,360
Is that what you're telling me?
What? I wanna know. I wanna know!

409
00:54:43,320 --> 00:54:46,160
I do not understand!

410
00:54:46,560 --> 00:54:48,200
Look! Hey! Hey!

411
00:54:51,080 --> 00:54:53,120
OK I'm not gonna lie to you.

412
00:54:53,360 --> 00:54:58,200
I'm not gonna lie to you.
I have no idea what Schilling is up to.

413
00:54:58,720 --> 00:55:04,320
But I swear to god, that if we keep our
heads, and we stick together ...

414
00:55:04,560 --> 00:55:06,040
... We're gonna make it. OK?

415
00:55:14,680 --> 00:55:16,480
I promise.

416
00:55:17,560 --> 00:55:19,760
He's right, Jennifer.

417
00:55:20,040 --> 00:55:22,560
Captain, I'm sorry.

418
00:55:22,960 --> 00:55:26,720
I guess it's just got to me you know?
For the past few days I'm sorry.

419
00:56:04,360 --> 00:56:06,120
Alright they're coming in the back.

420
00:56:12,640 --> 00:56:14,160
We're here to help you.

421
00:56:27,120 --> 00:56:28,720
Where did he go?

422
00:56:57,240 --> 00:56:59,080
We have to get that book.
-Alright.

423
00:57:01,720 --> 00:57:03,360
Wait here.

424
00:57:36,200 --> 00:57:39,160
Sam? It's me Callie.

425
00:57:39,600 --> 00:57:41,280
Sam, help me, please.

426
00:57:41,480 --> 00:57:44,960
Sam open the door. It's Callie, Sam.
Please.

427
00:57:48,320 --> 00:57:49,760
Sam, don't!

428
00:57:53,480 --> 00:57:54,760
Hi!

429
00:57:58,480 --> 00:58:00,160
Now what?

430
00:58:04,080 --> 00:58:07,480
What the fuck were you trying to do, heh?
-Nothing, I'm sorry alright?

431
00:58:07,680 --> 00:58:09,280
You trying to kill me, huh?

432
00:58:09,560 --> 00:58:12,200
Captain I told you I'm not cut out for
this kind of crap I'm just not.

433
00:58:12,400 --> 00:58:13,840
Sam he said he was sorry.

434
00:58:14,040 --> 00:58:15,960
I am sick of your excuses you little
whimp.

435
00:58:16,160 --> 00:58:18,080
Lay off man.
-Sam!

436
00:58:18,280 --> 00:58:19,800
Do you understand me ?!

437
00:58:22,560 --> 00:58:23,640
Oops. Oh Boy.

438
00:58:29,120 --> 00:58:30,600
What are you?

439
00:58:31,080 --> 00:58:33,680
Oh captain, you disappointed me.
You of all people shouldn't have to ask.

440
00:58:34,800 --> 00:58:37,080
I don't know what you are talking about.

441
00:58:37,320 --> 00:58:40,560
I think you know exactly what
I am talking about.

442
00:58:40,800 --> 00:58:43,120
I had a long talk with Schilling.

443
00:58:43,440 --> 00:58:45,600
He told me your just like your dad
just like him.

444
00:58:45,840 --> 00:58:49,760
Spittin image. And we all know that an
apple doesn't fall very far from the tree.

445
00:58:55,160 --> 00:58:57,760
Undead son of a bitch.

446
00:59:04,440 --> 00:59:06,680
A little fresh air, heh? Come on!

447
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:04,440
What was he talking about?

448
01:00:05,080 --> 01:00:07,320
Who are you ?

449
01:00:08,720 --> 01:00:11,280
The truth is I don't even know.

450
01:00:11,520 --> 01:00:13,600
Please let's just get the book, OK?

451
01:01:06,800 --> 01:01:08,160
Oh no.

452
01:01:08,560 --> 01:01:10,560
Baines is alive again.

453
01:01:10,800 --> 01:01:14,080
No. This time he was dragged.

454
01:01:18,120 --> 01:01:19,960
There it is.

455
01:01:54,600 --> 01:01:57,560
I can't even tell you what language this
book is.

456
01:01:58,600 --> 01:02:01,880
It looks like someone translated some
of it in ???

457
01:02:03,440 --> 01:02:05,080
What does it say?

458
01:02:11,320 --> 01:02:13,440
If a demon ...

459
01:02:14,240 --> 01:02:17,640
... can complete a circle of
eight during the day of the portal ...

460
01:02:17,840 --> 01:02:21,120
... a day which comes but once
every thousand years ...

461
01:02:21,480 --> 01:02:24,040
... he can raise Satan himself ...

462
01:02:24,640 --> 01:02:27,280
The demon and one of his own blood ...

463
01:02:28,680 --> 01:02:33,720
... must gather six human beings ...

464
01:02:35,480 --> 01:02:38,800
... and emblaze the mark of Satan
upon their flesh ...

465
01:02:41,960 --> 01:02:46,040
... and sacrifice their mixed human
blood in the ceremony of the pentacle ...

466
01:02:47,160 --> 01:02:48,600
... at the appointed time.

467
01:02:50,520 --> 01:02:53,800
Then Satan himself will pass through
the portal ...

468
01:02:57,920 --> 01:03:00,400
... and reign supreme over all
the earth.

469
01:03:01,360 --> 01:03:03,040
The portal.

470
01:03:05,120 --> 01:03:08,000
That's what Karl Schilling found.
-Oh my god!

471
01:03:10,800 --> 01:03:12,800
He's a demon.

472
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:18,680
Which makes you...
- Someone who's been ??? who he is.

473
01:03:23,640 --> 01:03:25,600
For longer than you can imagine.
Look.

474
01:03:25,840 --> 01:03:29,760
I need you to not be afraid of me.
I need you to trust me.

475
01:03:30,040 --> 01:03:32,000
I need you.

476
01:03:37,040 --> 01:03:39,280
To not be afraid of me.

477
01:03:43,400 --> 01:03:46,000
I don't know why ...

478
01:03:48,560 --> 01:03:50,560
But I believe you.

479
01:03:51,840 --> 01:03:53,440
I do.

480
01:04:05,760 --> 01:04:08,720
I'm just scared. I'm so scared.

481
01:04:10,800 --> 01:04:14,080
So am I. But we can't hide here any
longer.

482
01:04:14,320 --> 01:04:17,480
We have to kill him.

483
01:04:20,400 --> 01:04:23,160
But how are we going to do that?

484
01:04:24,440 --> 01:04:26,040
Baines ...

485
01:04:27,360 --> 01:04:29,600
... Was dragged ...

486
01:04:30,160 --> 01:04:36,240
... which means that you killed him
when you stabbed him through the
chest with the harpoon.

487
01:04:37,040 --> 01:04:40,880
So the heart. It has to be the heart.

488
01:04:43,720 --> 01:04:45,360
God I hope you're right.

489
01:04:50,160 --> 01:04:52,160
We got to get out of here.

490
01:05:24,840 --> 01:05:26,520
Pull the emergency lever!

491
01:05:30,800 --> 01:05:32,400
Here, hold this.

492
01:05:36,480 --> 01:05:37,960
Hurry.

493
01:06:37,560 --> 01:06:39,560
Don't stop!

494
01:06:41,200 --> 01:06:44,840
I can't take it.
-OK, I carry you.

495
01:07:38,840 --> 01:07:41,280
Sam, look. The elevator.

496
01:12:51,400 --> 01:12:52,960
Stop.

497
01:12:53,240 --> 01:12:57,640
What's the matter? Forget who you
are?

498
01:12:57,840 --> 01:13:00,920
I tried, but you wouldn't let me.

499
01:13:01,120 --> 01:13:03,080
Let her go.

500
01:13:03,680 --> 01:13:05,720
Don't tell me your still mad about...

501
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:07,520
...what's her name?

502
01:13:07,720 --> 01:13:09,800
That was over eighty years ago.

503
01:13:10,520 --> 01:13:14,680
Mary.
Her name was Mary.

504
01:13:30,720 --> 01:13:33,600
Ah, quit ???, I saved you some.

505
01:13:50,680 --> 01:13:52,960
Why?

506
01:14:05,240 --> 01:14:07,800
I worshipped you.

507
01:14:08,040 --> 01:14:11,800
For over a thousand years
I followed you from end of the
earth to the other.

508
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:15,760
I found you victims, and
buried you dead.

509
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:18,880
And the first time I felt something tender
for another living soul you

510
01:14:19,160 --> 01:14:20,960
torture her to death.

511
01:14:21,280 --> 01:14:25,360
That is you mothers blood speaking.

512
01:14:26,240 --> 01:14:31,040
Weak, pathetic, human blood.

513
01:14:32,280 --> 01:14:35,240
Forget not who your father is, Sam!

514
01:14:35,440 --> 01:14:38,200
No!
-Yes!

515
01:14:38,840 --> 01:14:42,920
We were brought into this world for
one purpose.

516
01:14:43,560 --> 01:14:47,240
To prepare for his return.

517
01:14:47,520 --> 01:14:49,320
No!

518
01:14:49,520 --> 01:14:57,640
If he does not return, here, tonight,
we no longer live forever, Sam.

519
01:14:58,400 --> 01:15:02,840
Good. Because I'm tired of all this.

520
01:15:33,440 --> 01:15:36,200
??? get it right! Through
the heart...

521
01:15:39,200 --> 01:15:41,960
That's it. Feel the power.

522
01:15:42,160 --> 01:15:44,760
The joy of taking another life.

523
01:16:02,640 --> 01:16:05,200
Good. Gooood.

524
01:16:06,960 --> 01:16:10,240
Complete the circle of eight.

525
01:16:12,120 --> 01:16:16,680
Behold. Our fathers kingdom.

526
01:16:17,280 --> 01:16:19,280
Come to us.

527
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:36,680
I'm not afraid of you, Sam.

528
01:16:38,720 --> 01:16:40,880
I LOVE YOU.

529
01:16:53,240 --> 01:16:58,680
Love? Only weaklings
and fools believe in love.

530
01:16:59,320 --> 01:17:00,920
Kill her!

531
01:17:02,280 --> 01:17:04,680
Now before its too late.

532
01:17:25,600 --> 01:17:27,320
Goodbye, Karl.

533
01:17:27,560 --> 01:17:30,120
May god have mercy on your
soul.

534
01:17:30,480 --> 01:17:32,400
Soul?

535
01:17:34,280 --> 01:17:36,760
I have no soul.

536
01:17:39,520 --> 01:17:41,640
Jennifer, come on, let's go.

537
01:17:48,160 --> 01:17:52,000
If I'm going back to hell, you're
coming with me!

538
01:17:57,160 --> 01:17:59,200
Give me your hand.

539
01:18:48,840 --> 01:18:50,920
Karl!

540
01:19:32,040 --> 01:19:34,480
Jennifer, dynamite.

541
01:20:13,080 --> 01:20:14,960
Mary ...

542
01:20:17,200 --> 01:20:18,960
Mary ...

543
01:21:26,520 --> 01:21:29,560
Will I ever understand?

544
01:21:30,720 --> 01:21:34,760
All I know is how I feel about you.
