00:01:02,362 --> 00:01:05,196
- While most four year
olds are playing with toys,

2
00:01:05,198 --> 00:01:08,233
Angelo Inglesian was
casting pagan spells,

3
00:01:08,235 --> 00:01:12,137
doing drugs, and having
sex with adult women.

4
00:01:12,139 --> 00:01:13,873
His father was a
practicing pagan,

5
00:01:13,875 --> 00:01:16,042
mixing elixirs and
collecting herbs

6
00:01:16,044 --> 00:01:17,645
from the Albanian countryside.

7
00:01:19,047 --> 00:01:21,614
At five, he was excited
to study paganism

8
00:01:21,616 --> 00:01:23,785
under the pagan Pope of Olympus.

9
00:01:25,553 --> 00:01:28,554
By the time he was 11,
he was dealing drugs,

10
00:01:28,556 --> 00:01:31,891
pimping out his cousins and
even deeper into paganism.

11
00:01:31,893 --> 00:01:34,328
At 15, he had a
major drug overdose.

12
00:01:35,429 --> 00:01:36,798
He died and went to hell.

13
00:01:40,501 --> 00:01:43,603
- Babe, I don't wanna do
your hippie shit today.

14
00:01:43,605 --> 00:01:44,438
- Shh.

15
00:01:46,173 --> 00:01:47,575
Just listen.

16
00:01:49,242 --> 00:01:50,078
- Okay.

17
00:01:52,112 --> 00:01:53,980
- Underneath your skin.

18
00:01:53,982 --> 00:01:55,681
- Uh-huh.

19
00:01:55,683 --> 00:01:58,517
- Below and between

20
00:01:58,519 --> 00:02:02,523
each fold in your brain,

21
00:02:04,191 --> 00:02:05,860
there is your

22
00:02:07,662 --> 00:02:11,633
stupid machinery.

23
00:02:15,135 --> 00:02:17,304
Picture this.

24
00:02:18,606 --> 00:02:21,308
Organs vibrating.

25
00:02:28,215 --> 00:02:30,049
- Stork man.

26
00:02:30,051 --> 00:02:34,789
- A voice crawled into my brain
like a parasite whispering,

27
00:02:36,223 --> 00:02:38,057
"You've been doing
drugs, Angelo,"

28
00:02:38,059 --> 00:02:42,227
"but you never reached
the opalescent epiphany."

29
00:02:42,229 --> 00:02:44,664
"You've never been super high."

30
00:02:44,666 --> 00:02:48,335
- These organs
have no past, no future,

31
00:02:50,838 --> 00:02:53,005
no preconceived notions.

32
00:02:53,007 --> 00:02:53,839
Sign this thing.

33
00:02:53,841 --> 00:02:54,676
- Yeah.

34
00:02:57,145 --> 00:02:59,712
I'm uh, I'm gonna be a dad.

35
00:02:59,714 --> 00:03:01,212
- Oh,
congratulations, that's great.

36
00:03:01,214 --> 00:03:03,483
- Yeah, my baby's in that box.

37
00:03:04,384 --> 00:03:07,086
- Oh.

38
00:03:07,088 --> 00:03:08,253
Hope it's all right.

39
00:03:08,255 --> 00:03:09,522
I didn't drop it or nothing.

40
00:03:09,524 --> 00:03:10,355
- No man, man.

41
00:03:10,357 --> 00:03:11,924
It's all good.

42
00:03:11,926 --> 00:03:13,826
- It came out of the
floor and grabbed me

43
00:03:13,828 --> 00:03:16,494
and I knew immediately I had
to get home to my mother.

44
00:03:16,496 --> 00:03:18,931
And then before I know
it, it got real dark.

45
00:03:18,933 --> 00:03:21,669

the depths of your body.

46
00:03:29,443 --> 00:03:31,844

I remember the orange
glow of the street lamps,

about your new device.

149

for versatility and
comfort in a compact form.

151
00:11:22,016 --> 00:11:23,749
When in use,

152
00:11:23,751 --> 00:11:25,052
pay attention to the
amount of pressure applied.

153
00:11:26,687 --> 00:11:28,555
Some users have
experienced tissue damage

154
00:11:28,557 --> 00:11:30,257
when exerting too much force.

155
00:11:33,761 --> 00:11:36,995

Warmth is relaxing and
encouraging circulation.

Cold water is invigorating

Do not heat in the microwave,
stove top, or oven with fire.

160
00:11:46,707 --> 00:11:50,108
Do not massage any single
area for more than 30 minutes.

Unless you want me to.

180

00:14:39,380 --> 00:14:40,782
You can do whatever you want.

187
00:14:45,953 --> 00:14:47,187
- I want a kid.

188
00:14:48,355 --> 00:14:49,189
A, a baby.

189
00:14:51,892 --> 00:14:52,727
- Yeah?

190
00:14:57,965 --> 00:14:58,899
Well,

191
00:15:01,803 --> 00:15:05,705
sounds like you should
get pregnant.

192
00:15:05,707 --> 00:15:06,541
Oh God.

193
00:15:08,308 --> 00:15:11,076
- You can be the mom
of my baby if you want.

194
00:15:34,268 --> 00:15:35,668
- Come here.

195
00:15:35,670 --> 00:15:36,504
Come on.

196
00:15:46,648 --> 00:15:47,682
Okay, Daddy,

197
00:15:50,350 --> 00:15:54,021
how about you tell me about

198
00:15:56,758 --> 00:15:58,593
the first girl you ever kissed.

199
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:01,763
- Her name was Maggie.

200
00:16:04,031 --> 00:16:05,834
- And
what was she like?

201
00:16:07,502 --> 00:16:09,669
- She smelled like hamburgers

202
00:16:09,671 --> 00:16:14,272
and she had dried tomato
sauce on her face.

203
00:16:14,274 --> 00:16:18,443
She cornered me behind the
house and made me kiss her,

204
00:16:18,445 --> 00:16:21,046
and I remember thinking,
"Don't kiss the tomato sauce,"

205
00:16:21,048 --> 00:16:22,648
"Don't kiss the tomato sauce,"

206
00:16:22,650 --> 00:16:24,349
and I was so fixated
on the tomato sauce

207
00:16:24,351 --> 00:16:25,687
that I landed right on it.

208
00:16:27,354 --> 00:16:31,191
And after that I started
humping pillows during nap time.

209
00:16:32,827 --> 00:16:34,228
- Do you still hump pillows?

210
00:16:35,730 --> 00:16:37,062
- No.

211
00:16:37,064 --> 00:16:38,965
That's kid stuff.

212
00:16:38,967 --> 00:16:42,302
- Then what do you hump now?

213
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:46,875
- I don't know.

214
00:16:49,577 --> 00:16:51,144
- I
have another idea.

215
00:17:11,164 --> 00:17:12,000
Isn't it cool?

216
00:17:13,166 --> 00:17:14,432
- Yeah.

217
00:17:14,434 --> 00:17:15,670
- Do you wanna eat one?

218
00:17:17,104 --> 00:17:21,174
We could do it "Lady
and the Tramp" style.

219
00:17:22,710 --> 00:17:25,343
- Uh, nah man.

220
00:17:25,345 --> 00:17:26,179
I'm, I'm good.

221
00:17:27,214 --> 00:17:28,282
- Why not?

222
00:17:29,684 --> 00:17:30,716
It'll make you feel good.

223
00:17:30,718 --> 00:17:32,185
- It's a living thing.

224
00:17:43,063 --> 00:17:44,899
- You should buy
these worms from me.

225
00:17:47,769 --> 00:17:49,102
I'll sell 'em to you cheap.

226
00:17:51,104 --> 00:17:51,973
Just try them.

227
00:17:52,974 --> 00:17:53,808
You'll like 'em.

228
00:17:56,109 --> 00:17:56,945
- Thank you.

229
00:18:14,461 --> 00:18:17,095
- Why didn't you take
the worms, Benny?

230
00:18:17,097 --> 00:18:20,267
Why didn't you take
the fucking worms?

231
00:18:22,436 --> 00:18:23,234
You know what?

232
00:18:23,236 --> 00:18:25,071
Fuck it.

233
00:18:25,073 --> 00:18:27,607
Hey, I just wanted to say
that I had a really great time

234
00:18:27,609 --> 00:18:29,677
and I would totally
do worms with you for-

235
00:18:30,979 --> 00:18:31,813
- Hey.

236
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:35,113
Did you leave this
behind 'cause I found it.

237
00:18:35,115 --> 00:18:36,616
Uh.

238
00:18:36,618 --> 00:18:37,451
- Uh,

239
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:40,021
yeah, thanks.

240
00:18:42,289 --> 00:18:43,524
Was there a girl in here?

241
00:18:44,458 --> 00:18:45,825
- Nope.

242
00:18:45,827 --> 00:18:46,661
Just me.

243
00:18:53,835 --> 00:18:55,166
You okay, man?

244
00:18:55,168 --> 00:18:56,002
- Yeah, I'm sorry.

245
00:18:56,004 --> 00:18:57,003
I'll, I'll go.

246
00:18:57,005 --> 00:18:58,271
I, I just need a place.

247
00:18:59,941 --> 00:19:01,809
- A place, uh, for what?

248
00:19:05,278 --> 00:19:06,346
- Place in the dirt.

249
00:19:07,314 --> 00:19:08,315
- That sounds dark.

250
00:19:12,987 --> 00:19:16,691
Sometimes I feel bad.

251
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:22,329
So, it's okay to feel
that way sometimes.

252
00:19:26,734 --> 00:19:28,400
- Oh no, uh, nah man.

253
00:19:28,402 --> 00:19:32,339
I, I meant like a
place for these worms.

254
00:19:36,811 --> 00:19:37,645
Careful.

255
00:19:38,746 --> 00:19:39,580
- Sorry.

256
00:19:45,987 --> 00:19:46,821
Let me see.

257
00:19:57,832 --> 00:19:58,666
Whoa.

258
00:20:01,502 --> 00:20:02,335
- Yeah, man.

259
00:20:03,771 --> 00:20:07,338
I'm just trying to
like preserve life.

260
00:20:07,340 --> 00:20:08,176
You know?

261
00:20:10,011 --> 00:20:10,845
- I understand.

262
00:20:12,547 --> 00:20:13,546
Worms are life.

263
00:20:13,548 --> 00:20:14,847
- Worms are love.

264
00:20:14,849 --> 00:20:15,683
- Yeah.

265
00:20:23,457 --> 00:20:25,423
- I didn't used to
fuck with queers.

266
00:20:25,425 --> 00:20:26,259
You feel me?

267
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:33,768
- What do you mean?

268
00:20:35,103 --> 00:20:37,772
- But then I realized
I got a dick,

269
00:20:38,873 --> 00:20:41,807
and dudes will fuck anything.

270
00:20:41,809 --> 00:20:44,110
You can love anything.

271
00:20:44,112 --> 00:20:46,277
Fuck any damn thing, like,

272
00:20:46,279 --> 00:20:48,916
I got a dick, so I'm
gonna fuck with it.

273
00:20:55,923 --> 00:21:00,226
The girl I was with said you
can take these like drugs,

274
00:21:00,228 --> 00:21:04,395
and um, she wanted me
to take one with her

275
00:21:04,397 --> 00:21:07,500
like "Lady and the Tramp,"
but I said "No way."

276
00:21:07,502 --> 00:21:08,567
- No way.

277
00:21:08,569 --> 00:21:09,568
- Yeah.

278
00:21:09,570 --> 00:21:10,505
It was pretty hot, dude.

279
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:13,074
Anyway, man.

280
00:21:14,509 --> 00:21:16,842
I got a kid at home I
gotta take care of, so.

281
00:21:16,844 --> 00:21:17,777
- I feel you, man.

282
00:21:17,779 --> 00:21:19,310
- Yeah.

283
00:21:19,312 --> 00:21:20,311
- I'll take care
of these for you.

284
00:21:20,313 --> 00:21:22,683
- Oh, okay, yeah.

285
00:21:34,095 --> 00:21:36,929
- Worms spawning worms.

286
00:21:36,931 --> 00:21:39,364
Some of them were hairy,
some of them were slimy,

287
00:21:39,366 --> 00:21:41,600
and they were all
different sizes.

288
00:21:41,602 --> 00:21:43,434
There were itty bitty
ones in my mouth

289
00:21:43,436 --> 00:21:44,672
wrapped around my tongue.

290
00:21:46,473 --> 00:21:50,209
Some of the worms were in
makeup and bras and panties.

291
00:21:50,211 --> 00:21:53,813
They kept saying,
"Come make love to us."

292
00:21:53,815 --> 00:21:55,480
They were all laughing.

293
00:21:55,482 --> 00:21:56,982
- Laughing at you?

294
00:21:56,984 --> 00:21:58,651
- Yeah, and they said,
"We tricked you."

295
00:21:58,653 --> 00:22:00,286
"You were doing spells,"

296
00:22:00,288 --> 00:22:02,353
"and this is a setup
to take you to hell."

297
00:22:02,355 --> 00:22:03,825
They were tormenting me.

298
00:22:05,193 --> 00:22:06,659
- God damn it.

299
00:22:06,661 --> 00:22:08,493
- Reminded
me of my past.

300
00:22:08,495 --> 00:22:11,630
Everything I ever did in
my whole life on this earth

301
00:22:11,632 --> 00:22:13,165
was down there.

302
00:22:13,167 --> 00:22:15,801
- Hey, who told you
you could be in there?

303
00:22:15,803 --> 00:22:17,205
Sure as hell wasn't me.

304
00:22:19,173 --> 00:22:22,143
You got 10 minutes to
pack your bags, buddy.

305
00:22:24,545 --> 00:22:27,246
"Hey, I'm a baby."

306
00:22:27,248 --> 00:22:30,015
"Your mom let some
weirdo nut in her"

307
00:22:30,017 --> 00:22:33,855
"and now I live in
here."

308
00:22:40,661 --> 00:22:42,393
This could be fun.

309
00:22:42,395 --> 00:22:44,096
This could be great.

310
00:22:44,098 --> 00:22:45,333
God's plan, right?

311
00:22:46,667 --> 00:22:48,334
- How'd you get out?

312
00:22:48,336 --> 00:22:51,537
- I see this big worm,
bathed in purple,

313
00:22:51,539 --> 00:22:52,673
come out of the mush.

314
00:22:53,741 --> 00:22:55,341
Scared all the other worms away.

315
00:22:55,343 --> 00:22:56,441
I heard him say "He's mine."

316
00:22:56,443 --> 00:22:57,678
"Leave him to me."

317
00:22:59,446 --> 00:23:01,379
And he says to me, "Because
of your mother's prayers,"

318
00:23:01,381 --> 00:23:03,284
"you work for God now."

319
00:23:08,388 --> 00:23:10,689
- Do you feel
like we're one thing?

320
00:23:10,691 --> 00:23:11,957
- Yeah, I feel-

321
00:23:11,959 --> 00:23:12,793
Plugged in.

322
00:23:14,128 --> 00:23:14,960
- You do?

323
00:23:14,962 --> 00:23:16,427
Yes.

324
00:23:16,429 --> 00:23:17,899
We're one thing.

325
00:23:24,538 --> 00:23:27,640
Transfer your energy to
me and I'll do the same.

326
00:23:27,642 --> 00:23:29,275
Okay?

327
00:23:29,277 --> 00:23:30,544
Please do this for me.

328
00:23:31,746 --> 00:23:32,745
Okay, you ready?

329
00:23:32,747 --> 00:23:34,780
- Mm-hm, yeah.

330
00:23:34,782 --> 00:23:36,148
- Close your eyes.
- Uh, okay.

331
00:23:36,150 --> 00:23:37,415
- Close your eyes.
- Okay.

332
00:23:37,417 --> 00:23:39,151
- Do you feel it?

333
00:23:39,153 --> 00:23:40,254
I wanna feel it.

334
00:23:46,327 --> 00:23:47,728
- I'm sorry it's only 2%.

335
00:23:50,430 --> 00:23:51,431
Thirsty baby.

336
00:23:54,802 --> 00:23:56,070
I met your mom today.

337
00:23:58,306 --> 00:24:00,105
I think you're gonna love her.

338
00:24:00,107 --> 00:24:00,942
She's great.

339
00:24:02,944 --> 00:24:05,476
We didn't like do
the thing, you know?

340
00:24:05,478 --> 00:24:07,012
But it felt like we did,

341
00:24:07,014 --> 00:24:10,084
plus she's like so
beautiful and nice.

342
00:24:13,087 --> 00:24:14,487
I think she's gonna help us.

343
00:24:16,257 --> 00:24:19,694
I think she's gonna help
you become more real.

344
00:24:23,197 --> 00:24:24,598
Everything's got a purpose.

345
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:29,203
Everything's gotta do
what it's gotta do.

346
00:24:36,711 --> 00:24:37,979
I think I can help you.

- What are you guys doing?

357
00:25:54,288 --> 00:25:55,423
- She says it's cool.

358
00:25:57,725 --> 00:25:59,458
- Is it cool?

359
00:25:59,460 --> 00:26:00,628
- Oh, hey Roscoe.

360
00:26:03,764 --> 00:26:05,564
- Hey babe.

361
00:26:05,566 --> 00:26:07,399
- Jared is letting
me do the spider thing.

362
00:26:07,401 --> 00:26:09,234
You would never let me
do the spider thing.

363
00:26:09,236 --> 00:26:10,402
- Is that why you
guys are fucking now?

364
00:26:10,404 --> 00:26:11,603
- You wanted this.

365
00:26:11,605 --> 00:26:13,138
- I, I don't remember that.

366
00:26:13,140 --> 00:26:14,907
- You said you wanted
things to be more open.

367
00:26:14,909 --> 00:26:16,475
- No, I was talking
about the window.

368
00:26:16,477 --> 00:26:17,943
I wanted the window
to be open, that's-

369
00:26:17,945 --> 00:26:19,878
- Anyways.

370
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:22,049
We were wondering if we could
have the house for the night.

371
00:26:23,751 --> 00:26:25,554
- I'm, I'm just
gonna do some worms.

372
00:26:27,556 --> 00:26:28,555
- What are worms?

373
00:26:28,557 --> 00:26:29,423
- Shut up, Jared.

374
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:34,660
Oh.

375
00:26:34,662 --> 00:26:35,661
Oh.

376
00:26:35,663 --> 00:26:36,829
- Be careful.

377
00:26:36,831 --> 00:26:37,996
This guy's trying to get away.

378
00:26:37,998 --> 00:26:38,732
- You're gonna-

379
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:40,833
do them?

380
00:26:40,835 --> 00:26:42,103
- Yeah, do you um,

381
00:26:43,170 --> 00:26:45,737
do you wanna do worms with me?

382
00:26:45,739 --> 00:26:46,907
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

383
00:26:48,609 --> 00:26:50,010
- What do you do?

384
00:26:52,913 --> 00:26:55,414
- Just, just
take this guy right here.

385
00:26:55,416 --> 00:26:57,249
Go ahead, grab that one.

386
00:26:57,251 --> 00:26:58,784
Open your hand.

387
00:26:58,786 --> 00:27:00,087
- Oh
my God, oh my God.

388
00:27:01,822 --> 00:27:04,790
Okay, and then it's,
it's uh, it's pretty easy.

389
00:27:04,792 --> 00:27:05,626
You can um,

390
00:27:07,161 --> 00:27:08,963
well, you can snort it or,

391
00:27:10,431 --> 00:27:14,501
or chew it or bake it,
broil it, wh- whatever.

392
00:27:14,503 --> 00:27:16,135
- I'm ready.
- Okay.

393
00:27:16,137 --> 00:27:17,771
Ready?
- I'm ready for it.

394
00:27:25,346 --> 00:27:28,615
- Mm.

395
00:27:28,617 --> 00:27:29,483
- Let me see.

396
00:27:35,189 --> 00:27:36,688
- What do you think?

397
00:27:36,690 --> 00:27:38,724
What do you think?

398
00:27:43,864 --> 00:27:45,532
- Oh my God.

399
00:27:51,005 --> 00:27:51,839
Oh!

400
00:27:53,642 --> 00:27:54,475
Ooh.

401
00:27:56,310 --> 00:27:57,144
- Wait.

402
00:27:59,713 --> 00:28:00,748
We should snort ours.

403
00:28:02,917 --> 00:28:03,751
- I don't know.

404
00:28:05,152 --> 00:28:06,885
Is that cool?

405
00:28:06,887 --> 00:28:08,389
- Yeah, it's fucking cool.

406
00:28:09,857 --> 00:28:13,358
- Mm.

407
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:15,662
- Seems like she's
having a good time.

408
00:28:18,933 --> 00:28:21,702
- I can
feel it. Oh my god.

409
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:28,407
- Ah, ah.

410
00:28:36,050 --> 00:28:37,449
Yeah!

411
00:28:37,451 --> 00:28:40,620
Yeah, you got it, you got it!

412
00:28:40,622 --> 00:28:41,455
Ah!

413
00:28:52,933 --> 00:28:54,399
- One more, one more.

414
00:28:54,401 --> 00:28:56,235
- I can't do it, I can't do it.

415
00:28:56,237 --> 00:28:57,236
- No, you're gonna do it!

416
00:28:57,238 --> 00:28:59,706
- We're gonna do it!

417
00:30:15,650 --> 00:30:16,982
- Stay with me.

418
00:30:16,984 --> 00:30:19,686
Hey baby, stay with me, baby.

419
00:30:19,688 --> 00:30:21,219
Sam. Sam!

420
00:30:21,221 --> 00:30:22,056
Sam!

421
00:30:24,191 --> 00:30:25,457
Get her help.

422
00:31:03,030 --> 00:31:04,831
- Echopraxia.

423
00:31:04,833 --> 00:31:06,666
In echopraxia,

424
00:31:06,668 --> 00:31:08,735
the equation of body to land
become literal, natural.

425
00:31:08,737 --> 00:31:10,603
Delusions become of the earth.

426
00:31:10,605 --> 00:31:12,404
Similar to a poem.

427
00:31:12,406 --> 00:31:13,907
Similar to a worm.

428
00:31:15,342 --> 00:31:17,109
- What is echopraxia?

429
00:31:17,111 --> 00:31:19,044
- When an insane man
watches television

430
00:31:19,046 --> 00:31:21,246
and sees himself in its message,

431
00:31:21,248 --> 00:31:24,586
echopraxia is when he
follows the message's order.

432
00:31:27,388 --> 00:31:30,956
You must realize
your full potential.

433
00:31:30,958 --> 00:31:32,525
- Realize your full potential.

434
00:31:32,527 --> 00:31:34,562
- You walk
like you're half worm.

435
00:31:37,565 --> 00:31:41,636
Worms don't have limbs.

436
00:32:04,992 --> 00:32:06,994
- Jesus Christ.

437
00:32:08,162 --> 00:32:09,263
Look at that fucking-

438
00:32:10,832 --> 00:32:11,831
- He's a nice boy.

439
00:32:11,833 --> 00:32:12,966
Don't hurt him too bad.

440
00:32:43,464 --> 00:32:44,996
- All right.

441
00:32:44,998 --> 00:32:46,200
Here's how I imagine it.

442
00:32:47,702 --> 00:32:51,606
You're like a shell and
inside you is the yolk.

443
00:32:53,106 --> 00:32:56,542
And once I'm done,
you'll break out.

444
00:32:56,544 --> 00:32:57,377
You'll be real.

445
00:33:08,222 --> 00:33:09,022
Okay.

446
00:33:48,095 --> 00:33:49,427
- Hey!
- Oh, fuck!

447
00:33:49,429 --> 00:33:52,099
- You got my best girl pregnant!

448
00:33:57,237 --> 00:33:59,271
- I'm gonna be a dad?

449
00:34:00,107 --> 00:34:01,007
Oh, oh!

450
00:34:01,009 --> 00:34:01,843
No, no no!

451
00:34:03,043 --> 00:34:04,175
Stop, stop!

452
00:34:04,177 --> 00:34:05,013
Please!

453
00:34:10,685 --> 00:34:11,684
Fuck you.

454
00:34:11,686 --> 00:34:12,852
Fuck you.

455
00:34:12,854 --> 00:34:14,185
Stop.

456
00:34:16,691 --> 00:34:17,690
Stop it!

457
00:34:17,692 --> 00:34:18,392
- Fucking jag.

458
00:34:21,361 --> 00:34:22,394
- No!

459
00:34:22,396 --> 00:34:24,195
No, no!

460
00:34:30,437 --> 00:34:31,606
- It's yours, Benny.

461
00:34:34,308 --> 00:34:35,977
I want it to be you.

462
00:34:37,779 --> 00:34:38,613
- Baby!

463
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:41,415
Baby, come back!

464
00:34:42,817 --> 00:34:45,150
Come back, we were so close!

465
00:34:45,152 --> 00:34:46,821
No, baby, come back!

466
00:35:23,791 --> 00:35:24,626
- Benny.

467
00:35:25,927 --> 00:35:28,596
Everything happens for a reason.

468
00:35:30,632 --> 00:35:31,465
Hey.

469
00:35:36,771 --> 00:35:37,705
I did those worms.

470
00:35:39,272 --> 00:35:40,173
It felt great, man.

471
00:35:41,676 --> 00:35:43,878
Messed everything up.

472
00:35:48,281 --> 00:35:49,550
- Fuck you, bitch.

473
00:35:50,551 --> 00:35:52,484
- Hey, what, what's up?

474
00:35:56,390 --> 00:35:57,890
Benny!

475
00:36:04,966 --> 00:36:06,534
- Fuck, fuck.

476
00:36:26,821 --> 00:36:29,489
- Well, I'm sorry if I came
at an inconvenient time, man.

477
00:36:33,226 --> 00:36:34,327
- I'm usually better.

478
00:36:36,664 --> 00:36:37,497
- Yeah, me too.

479
00:36:38,866 --> 00:36:42,235
- No, I mean,
better at swimming.

480
00:36:43,905 --> 00:36:46,741
- Oh, well, I mean I'm
gener- generally just better.

481
00:37:12,734 --> 00:37:14,466
- They work?

482
00:37:14,468 --> 00:37:15,770
- Oh yeah, they work, man.

483
00:37:18,472 --> 00:37:19,638
Come on, do some worms.

484
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:20,706
Become one with the earth.

485
00:37:20,708 --> 00:37:21,707
- All right.

486
00:37:21,709 --> 00:37:22,908
- One with the dirt.

487
00:37:22,910 --> 00:37:24,043
- All right.

488
00:37:24,045 --> 00:37:24,946
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

489
00:37:39,727 --> 00:37:41,292
- How long does it
take for it to kick in?

490
00:37:41,294 --> 00:37:42,563
- Just wait for it.

491
00:37:43,831 --> 00:37:44,832
Wait for it.

492
00:37:50,337 --> 00:37:51,606
- No man, you're
fucking with me.

493
00:37:54,509 --> 00:37:55,676
- You'll know.

494
00:37:56,944 --> 00:37:57,945
You'll know.

495
00:38:24,005 --> 00:38:25,336
- Fired up!

496
00:38:25,338 --> 00:38:26,839
Fired up!

497
00:38:26,841 --> 00:38:28,207
Fired up!

498
00:38:28,209 --> 00:38:30,812
Yeah!

499
00:39:39,379 --> 00:39:41,747
- Why are you staring at me?

500
00:39:41,749 --> 00:39:43,284
- You're beautiful, Clown King.

501
00:39:45,219 --> 00:39:47,221
- Well, fuckin' quit it, bitch.

502
00:39:48,956 --> 00:39:51,557
- You're not my first
clown king, Biff.

503
00:39:51,559 --> 00:39:52,392
- Oh, I know.

504
00:39:54,295 --> 00:39:56,530
- Yeah, I'll get another
one if you're mean to me.

505
00:39:57,464 --> 00:39:58,431
- Yeah, I know.

506
00:40:03,037 --> 00:40:05,304
- I'll bash your
fuckin' skull in, okay?

507
00:40:05,306 --> 00:40:06,639
- Okay, okay.

508
00:40:06,641 --> 00:40:08,406
We have these though.

509
00:40:08,408 --> 00:40:09,377
- We gotta save those.

510
00:40:13,714 --> 00:40:14,548
- Please.

511
00:40:20,755 --> 00:40:24,823
Oh, God damn it.

512
00:40:24,825 --> 00:40:26,961
Oh!

513
00:40:28,062 --> 00:40:30,562
Ooh.

514
00:40:30,564 --> 00:40:33,433
Oh fuck.

515
00:40:35,336 --> 00:40:39,004
Oh, God, oh-

516
00:40:50,284 --> 00:40:52,119
- How do you feel now?

517
00:40:54,322 --> 00:40:55,957
- Like I could murder the world.

518
00:41:10,104 --> 00:41:11,437
- Henrietta!

519
00:41:11,439 --> 00:41:12,438
- Let me find these guys.

520
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:14,440
- Henrietta!

521
00:41:14,442 --> 00:41:15,276
I'm here!

522
00:41:16,610 --> 00:41:17,445
I'm here.

523
00:41:18,379 --> 00:41:19,311
I'm here.

524
00:41:19,313 --> 00:41:20,312
- Ben-

525
00:41:20,314 --> 00:41:21,816
Benny, I found some.

526
00:41:23,551 --> 00:41:26,051
Benny, Benny, I found some.

527
00:41:26,053 --> 00:41:27,519
Oh, hey, hey.

528
00:41:27,521 --> 00:41:28,988
Hey.

529
00:41:32,159 --> 00:41:33,325
- I gotta
find Henrietta.

530
00:41:33,327 --> 00:41:34,560
I gotta find Henrietta, dude!

531
00:41:34,562 --> 00:41:35,396
I gotta find Henrietta.

532
00:41:38,799 --> 00:41:40,466
- Henrietta.
- Henrietta!

533
00:41:40,468 --> 00:41:41,467
- Henrietta.

534
00:41:41,469 --> 00:41:42,868
Help me find her, man.

535
00:41:42,870 --> 00:41:44,803
Henrietta, open up.

536
00:41:44,805 --> 00:41:46,138
Henrietta, Henrietta.

537
00:41:46,140 --> 00:41:47,539
- Oh, Henrietta, there she is.

538
00:41:47,541 --> 00:41:51,176
- Henrietta, Henrietta.
- I'll help you.

539
00:41:52,179 --> 00:41:53,212
- Henrietta!

540
00:41:53,214 --> 00:41:54,646
I'm here!

541
00:41:54,648 --> 00:41:56,548
I'm here!

542
00:42:03,691 --> 00:42:05,157
- Whoa.

543
00:42:05,159 --> 00:42:06,859
- Shit, bro.

544
00:42:06,861 --> 00:42:08,360
Sorry dude.

545
00:42:08,362 --> 00:42:10,362
- You wanna do
some worms with us?

546
00:42:10,364 --> 00:42:12,031
- Worms?

547
00:42:12,033 --> 00:42:12,867
- Worms.

548
00:42:14,335 --> 00:42:16,902
- Yeah bro, they
get you fucked up!

549
00:42:16,904 --> 00:42:18,270
- You shoulda, you
shoulda just said that.

550
00:42:18,272 --> 00:42:19,271
I like getting fucked up.

551
00:42:19,273 --> 00:42:20,572
Yeah, come on in.

552
00:42:20,574 --> 00:42:21,740
- All right, man.

553
00:42:21,742 --> 00:42:23,008
Let's fuckin' do it, man.

554
00:42:23,010 --> 00:42:24,009
Yeah, man!

555
00:42:24,011 --> 00:42:24,843
That's what's up.

556
00:42:24,845 --> 00:42:26,011
Let's do this.

557
00:42:26,013 --> 00:42:26,845
- All right, let's do it.

558
00:42:27,681 --> 00:42:29,516
- Oh yeah, man.

559
00:42:29,518 --> 00:42:31,450
You can smell this shit
through the fucking cosmos.

560
00:42:36,323 --> 00:42:38,090
- There's only
wrong way to do worms, man.

561
00:42:38,092 --> 00:42:39,124
- Not do worms?

562
00:42:39,126 --> 00:42:39,960
- Yes.

563
00:42:41,530 --> 00:42:43,364
- Just put it in here.

564
00:42:44,698 --> 00:42:46,200
Bottoms up, y'all.

565
00:42:49,203 --> 00:42:50,037
Oh.

566
00:42:52,907 --> 00:42:54,075
It's got a zip to it.

567
00:43:58,305 --> 00:44:00,372
- We're just trying
to keep it real,

568
00:44:00,374 --> 00:44:01,940
and it's yuppie fucks like you

569
00:44:01,942 --> 00:44:03,477
that stop us from
getting in the dirt!

570
00:44:40,147 --> 00:44:42,814
- Henrietta, can you
say hi to the Worm King?

571
00:44:42,816 --> 00:44:44,183
- Hi, Wormie.

572
00:44:44,185 --> 00:44:45,518
- Spell worm for me?

573
00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:47,686
- W-O-R-M.

574
00:44:47,688 --> 00:44:48,854
- Very good.

575
00:44:48,856 --> 00:44:51,223
- You doing okay there, buddy?

576
00:44:51,225 --> 00:44:54,393
- What's your
favorite shape, Henrietta?

577
00:44:54,395 --> 00:44:55,994
- I like octagons.

578
00:44:55,996 --> 00:44:57,329
- How many
sides does that have?

579
00:44:57,331 --> 00:44:58,330
- Eight.

580
00:44:58,332 --> 00:45:00,199
- Wrong!

581
00:45:00,201 --> 00:45:03,335
An octagon has an infinite
number of sides and points.

582
00:45:03,337 --> 00:45:06,705
An octagon is just
a misunderstanding.

583
00:45:06,707 --> 00:45:09,408
You have to unlearn your shapes.

584
00:45:09,410 --> 00:45:10,909
- Okay.

585
00:45:10,911 --> 00:45:13,412
- Your
shapes are all wrong.

586
00:45:13,414 --> 00:45:16,915
Once you unlearn your
shapes, you can do anything.

587
00:45:16,917 --> 00:45:19,184
There are no more rules.

588
00:45:19,186 --> 00:45:21,053
- Yo Dennis.

589
00:45:21,055 --> 00:45:21,887
- Nothing is real,
and everything is permitted.

590
00:45:21,889 --> 00:45:23,121
- Yeah, man?

591
00:45:23,123 --> 00:45:25,023
- I didn't used to with queers.

592
00:45:25,025 --> 00:45:26,559
You feel me?

593
00:45:26,561 --> 00:45:27,560
So I can do this?

594
00:45:27,562 --> 00:45:29,428
- Yeah, me neither.

595
00:45:29,430 --> 00:45:33,901
- Yeah, but then I realized
that dude's fuck anything.

596
00:45:34,969 --> 00:45:36,268
Like you can love anything.

597
00:45:36,270 --> 00:45:39,238
Fuck any damn thing.

598
00:45:39,240 --> 00:45:42,977
Like, I got a dick, so
I'm gonna fuck with it.

599
00:45:45,312 --> 00:45:49,383
- You must
realize your full potential.

600
00:45:51,085 --> 00:45:52,886
Realize my full potential?

601
00:45:58,325 --> 00:46:00,125
- Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa.

602
00:46:00,127 --> 00:46:00,961
Dude.

603
00:46:02,631 --> 00:46:03,630
- What, what?

604
00:46:03,632 --> 00:46:04,631
- What the fuck, man?

605
00:46:04,633 --> 00:46:05,464
I'm not about that shit.

606
00:46:05,466 --> 00:46:06,298
What the fuck?

607
00:46:06,300 --> 00:46:07,899
- No, wait.

608
00:46:07,901 --> 00:46:08,900
No, you were just
talking that you-

609
00:46:08,902 --> 00:46:10,402
- Not now.

610
00:46:10,404 --> 00:46:12,337
There's too much fucking
shit going on, dude.

611
00:46:12,339 --> 00:46:13,171
- You know what, Benny?

612
00:46:13,173 --> 00:46:14,006
Fuck you, man!

613
00:46:14,008 --> 00:46:15,173
- Fuck-

614
00:46:15,175 --> 00:46:19,811
My baby drowned at the beach!

615
00:46:19,813 --> 00:46:21,446
- Huh?

616
00:46:21,448 --> 00:46:22,515
Your kid drowned?

617
00:46:22,517 --> 00:46:24,751
- Yeah, today.

618
00:46:24,753 --> 00:46:25,819
- Oh fuck.

619
00:46:29,023 --> 00:46:30,222
Oh my God.

620
00:46:30,224 --> 00:46:31,758
- You know what, I have to go.

621
00:46:31,760 --> 00:46:33,325
- Yeah,
you do have to go.

622
00:46:33,327 --> 00:46:34,826
- Yeah, I know. I'm
gonna go right now.

623
00:46:34,828 --> 00:46:35,994
- Yeah, then
fucking go then, Roscoe.

624
00:46:35,996 --> 00:46:36,696
- Yeah, I'm leaving right now.

625
00:46:36,698 --> 00:46:37,464
- Yeah, fucking go.

626
00:46:40,134 --> 00:46:42,036
Wait, Roscoe, wait!

627
00:46:45,774 --> 00:46:46,608
- Man.

628
00:48:04,719 --> 00:48:06,918
- It's like, all
I wanna do is watch TV.

629
00:48:06,920 --> 00:48:08,755
You know?

630
00:48:08,757 --> 00:48:10,055
That's all I wanna do, is
just watch a little bit of TV

631
00:48:10,057 --> 00:48:11,693
and I can't even
fuckin' do that.

632
00:48:13,628 --> 00:48:15,894
Like, it doesn't seem to have,

633
00:48:15,896 --> 00:48:17,797
they don't seem
to have any sense

634
00:48:17,799 --> 00:48:20,467
of what human beings really
like wanna watch, you know?

635
00:48:22,236 --> 00:48:26,104
So I have to go stab a homeless
guy or something, you know?

636
00:48:26,106 --> 00:48:27,472
Whatever.

637
00:48:27,474 --> 00:48:28,777
I'm not saying it's right.

638
00:48:39,286 --> 00:48:41,155
Hey, hey, hey.

639
00:48:43,558 --> 00:48:44,724
What's up?

640
00:48:44,726 --> 00:48:45,593
You got any worms tonight?

641
00:48:47,729 --> 00:48:48,929
You look familiar.

642
00:48:58,972 --> 00:49:00,575
- You bitch, bitch!

643
00:49:03,243 --> 00:49:04,077
- Benny!

644
00:49:10,250 --> 00:49:11,784
- No, these
guys are crazy.

645
00:49:11,786 --> 00:49:12,819
Benny, you gotta
get me out of it.

646
00:49:12,821 --> 00:49:13,655
Benny!

647
00:49:14,321 --> 00:49:15,922
- Oh, fuck you!

648
00:49:15,924 --> 00:49:17,289
- You don't touch
my friend, Benny!

649
00:49:18,760 --> 00:49:20,093
- Oh, I'm sorry.

650
00:49:21,295 --> 00:49:23,028
I do know you.

651
00:49:34,308 --> 00:49:35,842
- Do you like pornos?

652
00:49:35,844 --> 00:49:36,843
Shut up.

653
00:49:36,845 --> 00:49:37,777
Do you watch porno?

654
00:49:37,779 --> 00:49:38,546
Shut up!

655
00:49:40,849 --> 00:49:41,816
- Roscoe!

656
00:49:42,684 --> 00:49:43,518
Roscoe.

657
00:49:46,621 --> 00:49:48,453
- Cozy.

658
00:49:50,658 --> 00:49:51,657
- Answer me.

659
00:49:51,659 --> 00:49:52,658
Shut up.

660
00:49:52,660 --> 00:49:53,358
Do you watch porno?

661
00:49:53,360 --> 00:49:54,192
- Yes!

662
00:49:54,194 --> 00:49:55,195
- Oh, shut up!

663
00:49:57,397 --> 00:49:58,664
- Give it.

664
00:50:09,176 --> 00:50:10,678
- What do you want, babe?

665
00:50:14,716 --> 00:50:16,883
Come on, you know, you know.

666
00:50:16,885 --> 00:50:18,684
Just, tell 'em what you want.

667
00:50:18,686 --> 00:50:20,420
- Psh-

668
00:50:30,264 --> 00:50:31,764
- We want a gun.

669
00:50:36,004 --> 00:50:38,036
- Do you have any wor- worms?

670
00:50:38,038 --> 00:50:39,674
- Yeah, we like worms.

671
00:50:44,378 --> 00:50:45,945
- We don't have worms.

672
00:50:45,947 --> 00:50:48,014
- Yeah, I know you
don't have worms.

673
00:50:48,016 --> 00:50:50,852
- You want
something off the dollar menu?

674
00:51:19,814 --> 00:51:20,648
- Hey.

675
00:51:25,753 --> 00:51:27,487
I just wanna do worms
with you guys, okay?

676
00:51:28,790 --> 00:51:30,255
- You wanna do worms with us?

677
00:51:32,994 --> 00:51:34,727
- Give it to me.

678
00:51:37,966 --> 00:51:39,599
- Woo, let's go!

679
00:52:08,963 --> 00:52:11,164
- Hi,
can I help you?

680
00:52:12,767 --> 00:52:13,601
Hey.

681
00:52:15,469 --> 00:52:17,170
Hey, what the hell?

682
00:52:20,642 --> 00:52:22,273
What the hell do you think-

683
00:52:22,275 --> 00:52:23,174
Ooh!

684
00:52:33,621 --> 00:52:34,787
- All right,
where are they?

685
00:52:34,789 --> 00:52:36,354
I know you got 'em somewhere.

686
00:52:36,356 --> 00:52:37,823
Why don't you just tell
me where they are, huh?

687
00:52:37,825 --> 00:52:39,391
Over here?

688
00:52:39,393 --> 00:52:40,494
Over here?

689
00:52:41,863 --> 00:52:44,130
No, I'm really not
seeing any of the worms.

690
00:52:45,298 --> 00:52:47,133
Where the fuck are the worms?

691
00:52:47,135 --> 00:52:49,037
Where the fuck are the worms?

692
00:52:50,505 --> 00:52:52,237
- It's
the wrong season.

693
00:53:03,685 --> 00:53:05,019
There's no worms.

694
00:53:06,253 --> 00:53:07,689
There's no worms.

695
00:53:15,897 --> 00:53:17,863
- You okay, chief?

696
00:53:17,865 --> 00:53:19,031
- They got cigarettes?

697
00:53:19,033 --> 00:53:19,867
- Oh, cigarettes.

698
00:53:21,169 --> 00:53:22,668
You want some cigarettes

699
00:53:22,670 --> 00:53:23,836
now that you've
seen a bleeding guy.

700
00:53:23,838 --> 00:53:25,037
You're a big smoker, huh?

701
00:53:25,039 --> 00:53:25,873
Enjoy.

702
00:53:33,014 --> 00:53:34,682
- It's
the wrong season.

703
00:53:38,953 --> 00:53:40,688
- Why'd
you stab that guy?

704
00:53:42,222 --> 00:53:43,488
- He looks like every
other faceless person

705
00:53:43,490 --> 00:53:44,592
I've seen and forgotten.

706
00:54:10,450 --> 00:54:11,919
- He's suffering, Roscoe.

707
00:54:45,119 --> 00:54:46,353
- Oh, oh, oh, oh!

708
00:55:02,270 --> 00:55:05,206
- You have
to unlearn your shapes.

709
00:55:07,542 --> 00:55:11,112
Your shapes are all wrong.

710
00:55:33,968 --> 00:55:35,500
- Man.

711
00:55:35,502 --> 00:55:38,137
- Benny, your problem is

712
00:55:38,139 --> 00:55:39,907
you never unlearned
your own shapes.

713
00:55:41,642 --> 00:55:42,844
Your shapes are all wrong.

714
00:55:46,714 --> 00:55:49,083
- What a shitty day this
turned out to be, dude.

715
00:55:50,184 --> 00:55:52,553
These guys are way not cool.

716
00:55:56,324 --> 00:55:57,490
- I'm the cool one now.

717
00:56:20,047 --> 00:56:23,414
- What do
we got here, huh?

718
00:56:25,353 --> 00:56:26,384
Look at this guy.

719
00:56:26,386 --> 00:56:27,418
- He's so cute.

720
00:56:27,420 --> 00:56:28,921
- Oh my God.

721
00:56:28,923 --> 00:56:30,556
- He looks
like a nice guy.

722
00:56:30,558 --> 00:56:32,691
Oh, he says hello.

723
00:56:32,693 --> 00:56:34,459
- Hey, take
this beer, man.

724
00:56:34,461 --> 00:56:35,296
Take that.

725
00:56:37,565 --> 00:56:38,731
Chuck it.

726
00:56:38,733 --> 00:56:39,798
- Yeah, throw the beer.

727
00:56:39,800 --> 00:56:40,966
- Throw the beer.

728
00:56:40,968 --> 00:56:42,568
- Throw the beer.

729
00:56:42,570 --> 00:56:43,537
Throw the beer!

730
00:56:44,605 --> 00:56:45,638
- Yeah, throw the beer.

731
00:56:45,640 --> 00:56:46,805
- Throw the beer.

732
00:56:46,807 --> 00:56:48,374
- Throw the beer.

733
00:56:48,376 --> 00:56:51,110
- Throw the
beer, throw the beer,

734
00:56:51,112 --> 00:56:52,878
throw the beer!

735
00:56:59,587 --> 00:57:02,655
- Throw the beer,
throw the beer, throw the beer!

736
00:57:02,657 --> 00:57:07,326
Throw the beer, throw
the beer, throw the beer!

737
00:57:08,663 --> 00:57:11,096
- Throw the beer, yeah!

738
00:57:11,098 --> 00:57:12,264
- Oh, he did.

739
00:57:14,101 --> 00:57:15,601
- Roscoe, what
the fuck did you do, man?

740
00:57:15,603 --> 00:57:16,771
What the fuck?

741
00:57:17,805 --> 00:57:18,639
Dennis!

742
00:57:19,640 --> 00:57:21,307
Dennis!

743
00:57:21,309 --> 00:57:22,308
- Hey man, you all right?

744
00:57:22,310 --> 00:57:24,343
- Dennis!

745
00:57:32,987 --> 00:57:35,688
- Hey, dude. Dude, are you okay?

746
00:57:41,494 --> 00:57:42,661
We return with

747
00:57:42,663 --> 00:57:43,829
- Come on, buddy boy.

748
00:57:43,831 --> 00:57:45,431
- Angelo Ingelian.

749
00:57:45,433 --> 00:57:46,932
- Welcome to the party.

750
00:57:46,934 --> 00:57:49,535
- He
died and went to hell.

751
00:57:49,537 --> 00:57:50,769
- Hey,
it was just a can.

752
00:57:50,771 --> 00:57:52,304
Do you think Dennis is okay?

753
00:57:52,306 --> 00:57:54,006
- Yes, I went to hell.

754
00:57:54,008 --> 00:57:56,342
- What
did you find there?

755
00:57:56,344 --> 00:57:58,312
- I ate
the demon's cuisine.

756
00:57:59,780 --> 00:58:01,549
Since I experienced
the worms of hell,

757
00:58:03,384 --> 00:58:07,688
I eat them to remind me of
the path to righteousness.

758
00:58:08,656 --> 00:58:10,658
- Get down there.

759
00:58:12,226 --> 00:58:13,826
- We want some worms.

760
00:58:13,828 --> 00:58:15,327
Want worms.
- Oh yeah?

761
00:58:15,329 --> 00:58:17,963
- Give me some
worms, please, pal?

762
00:58:17,965 --> 00:58:18,797
I want worms right now.

763
00:58:18,799 --> 00:58:19,965
- Yeah, you do.

764
00:58:19,967 --> 00:58:21,800
- Yeah, we want worms.

765
00:58:21,802 --> 00:58:23,669
- Yeah, we all want the worms,
but do you want the worms?

766
00:58:23,671 --> 00:58:25,204
- I want the worms.
- Here come the worms.

767
00:58:25,206 --> 00:58:28,309
- Yeah.

768
00:58:32,847 --> 00:58:34,813
- Welcome
to the worm hole.

769
00:58:44,392 --> 00:58:47,526
- Sorry for your
shit life, worm fuck.

770
00:58:52,666 --> 00:58:54,533
This is gonna feel kinda shitty.

771
00:58:54,535 --> 00:58:56,168
- What are you gonna do?

772
00:58:56,170 --> 00:58:57,669
- Um, I don't know.

773
00:58:57,671 --> 00:58:59,405
I've just been
having a hard time

774
00:58:59,407 --> 00:59:03,342
telling the difference
between a dream and real life.

775
00:59:03,344 --> 00:59:04,743
You know?

776
00:59:04,745 --> 00:59:06,578
- This feels really real.

777
00:59:06,580 --> 00:59:08,881
- Yeah, but that's just
because you're looking out

778
00:59:08,883 --> 00:59:11,550
through those two
fucked up eyes of yours.

779
00:59:11,552 --> 00:59:13,052
You know?

780
00:59:13,054 --> 00:59:14,789
- No, man, this is
definitely real life.

781
00:59:16,557 --> 00:59:19,224
- See, I've always had a hard
time telling what is real.

782
00:59:19,226 --> 00:59:21,060
It's like the internet
tells you things

783
00:59:21,062 --> 00:59:23,862
and then doctors tell
you something else,

784
00:59:23,864 --> 00:59:25,898
and then your family
and all of this stuff.

785
00:59:25,900 --> 00:59:26,899
Do, you know what I mean, right?

786
00:59:26,901 --> 00:59:27,735
Like I just-

787
00:59:28,803 --> 00:59:30,102
- Try these wormies.

788
00:59:37,311 --> 00:59:39,878
- Okay, I don't
think I like this.

789
00:59:43,951 --> 00:59:45,651
- What do
you got for him?

790
00:59:45,653 --> 00:59:46,819
- Oh, we've got
something really amazing.

791
00:59:46,821 --> 00:59:47,755
- What do you got?

792
00:59:51,058 --> 00:59:52,259
- He's got a boner.

793
00:59:53,794 --> 00:59:56,128
- Is that a boner?

794
00:59:56,130 --> 00:59:58,063
- Is that a boner!

795
01:00:05,906 --> 01:00:08,309
- Ooh, look at that.

796
01:00:45,614 --> 01:00:47,946
- No, Benny, no.

797
01:01:03,330 --> 01:01:04,163
Stop.

798
01:01:04,165 --> 01:01:05,399
Stop it, Benny.

799
01:01:07,701 --> 01:01:10,736
I'm sorry, Benny.

800
01:01:10,738 --> 01:01:12,037
- This.

801
01:01:12,039 --> 01:01:13,005
This.

802
01:01:27,354 --> 01:01:28,756
- It's cool, bro.

803
01:01:30,090 --> 01:01:30,923
- What?

804
01:01:30,925 --> 01:01:33,194
Benny, no.

805
01:01:34,228 --> 01:01:35,861
- It's all good.

806
01:01:43,003 --> 01:01:44,504
- Benny, help.

807
01:01:44,506 --> 01:01:45,904
Benny.

808
01:02:03,724 --> 01:02:05,625
- Just listen.

809
01:02:05,627 --> 01:02:07,560
Underneath your skin below
each fold in your brain.

810
01:02:07,562 --> 01:02:09,895
There is your stupid machinery.

811
01:02:09,897 --> 01:02:12,898
Organs that vibrate,
lubed up with blood.

812
01:02:12,900 --> 01:02:16,868
These organs have
no past, no future,

813
01:02:16,870 --> 01:02:19,204
no preconceived notions.

814
01:02:19,206 --> 01:02:22,274
Oh, just let the light shine in.

815
01:02:22,276 --> 01:02:23,576
Come on.

816
01:02:23,578 --> 01:02:25,911
Let your organs sing!

817
01:02:38,560 --> 01:02:40,392
Come on, you got this, okay?

818
01:02:40,394 --> 01:02:42,494
You're okay, you're okay.

819
01:02:42,496 --> 01:02:43,795

How could it be my baby?

843
01:04:10,518 --> 01:04:12,017
I didn't even come
at all, Henrietta.

844
01:04:23,897 --> 01:04:25,600
- All the sins of the world

845
01:04:28,168 --> 01:04:29,838
are collected by the earth.

846
01:04:31,606 --> 01:04:35,543
They seep into the soil and
are consumed by the worms.

01:04:38,747 --> 01:04:40,613
The dirt becomes the worm.

848
01:04:40,615 --> 01:04:44,552
The worm becomes the man
and the man becomes dirt.

849
01:04:46,387 --> 01:04:51,392
And my baby will absorb
the burden of man.

850
01:04:53,628 --> 01:04:55,795
- Your baby.

851
01:04:55,797 --> 01:04:57,764
