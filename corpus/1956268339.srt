1
00:00:35,770 --> 00:00:37,302
        Whoa!

2
00:00:37,304 --> 00:00:39,138
   Look out!
                   Look out!

3
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:40,272
              -Aah!
              -Aah!

4
00:00:41,308 --> 00:00:45,444
How dare thee show a noble lady
of the court such disrespect!

5
00:00:45,446 --> 00:00:47,713
                  Aw, man!
             We hit a princess!

6
00:00:50,951 --> 00:00:52,718
             Grrrrr!

7
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:54,186
         Come on, dude.
          We gotta go!

8
00:00:54,188 --> 00:00:57,489
      These Ren-fair people
       are way too extra!

9
00:01:02,797 --> 00:01:04,563
              -Pig!
              -Aah!

10
00:01:04,565 --> 00:01:05,731
              -Huh!
              -Uhh!

11
00:01:05,733 --> 00:01:08,967
        Such impropriety!
            Servants!

12
00:01:08,969 --> 00:01:12,404
     To think such ruffians
 could so easily accost a lady.

13
00:01:12,406 --> 00:01:15,274
                  The king
           will hear about this!

14
00:01:15,276 --> 00:01:18,510
      Your Highness, I had
 the most distressing encounter

15
00:01:18,512 --> 00:01:20,646
         with a pair of
        strange vagrants.

16
00:01:20,648 --> 00:01:23,749
                     Oh?
  Distressing vagrants, you say?

17
00:01:23,751 --> 00:01:26,685
           It's always something
             with you, Princess.

18
00:01:26,687 --> 00:01:29,588
I fear the safety of the kingdom
       may be compromised.

19
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:32,558
Out of my way, ladies!

20
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:34,259
        Security's fine.

21
00:01:34,261 --> 00:01:36,962
                         Uh...
     H-Hi?

22
00:01:36,964 --> 00:01:39,064
               Oh!

23
00:01:39,066 --> 00:01:40,432
 'Twas them, milord!

24
00:01:40,434 --> 00:01:42,134
   Don't worry about it, kid.

25
00:01:42,136 --> 00:01:46,171
 The kingdom's plenty safe with
 security like this on the case.

26
00:01:46,173 --> 00:01:48,841
      I'm sure our honored
        guest will agree.

27
00:01:48,843 --> 00:01:51,143
    Ain't that right, Spooky?

28
00:01:51,145 --> 00:01:53,312
How are we to punish
   the intruders?

29
00:01:53,314 --> 00:01:54,980
       Come on, Princess.

30
00:01:54,982 --> 00:01:58,584
      You know how we greet
   new guests to this kingdom.

31
00:01:58,586 --> 00:02:01,386
            Oh, yes.
        The magic trick.

32
00:02:01,388 --> 00:02:02,588
Magic trick?
                  Magic trick?

33
00:02:02,590 --> 00:02:04,089
          Magic trick.

34
00:02:04,091 --> 00:02:06,492
          Hoo-hoo! Ha!

35
00:02:06,494 --> 00:02:08,560
      Nothing up my sleeve.

36
00:02:08,562 --> 00:02:09,995
         Ooh. Anyway...

37
00:02:09,997 --> 00:02:12,998
          hope you boys
      are ready for a show.

38
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
               Wh-- Waaaa....

39
00:02:15,002 --> 00:02:18,003
       Don't you remember?
    You're my loyal subjects.

40
00:02:18,005 --> 00:02:21,573
   And I'm the just and noble
          King Zombozo,

41
00:02:21,575 --> 00:02:24,076
       lord of everything
        the light touches

42
00:02:24,078 --> 00:02:26,745
             here in
   the Kingdom of Zombozelot.

43
00:02:26,747 --> 00:02:28,514
      Not too shabby, huh?

44
00:02:28,516 --> 00:02:31,750
Parlor tricks are of
no use to me, jester.

45
00:02:31,752 --> 00:02:33,285
          Tough crowd.

46
00:02:33,287 --> 00:02:35,554
- Wow!
- Oi, milord.

47
00:02:35,556 --> 00:02:38,157
 What are our orders
to march, so to speak?

48
00:02:38,159 --> 00:02:39,124
              Uh...

49
00:02:39,126 --> 00:02:41,994
          Oh, I got it!
          Yoo-hoo-hoo!

50
00:02:41,996 --> 00:02:45,330
      How about we make you
   my new personal attendants?

51
00:02:45,332 --> 00:02:48,367
  But, my king, they should be
       <i> my</i>new attendants.

52
00:02:48,369 --> 00:02:51,436
         Oh, I'm sorry.
 Which one of us is king, again?

53
00:02:51,438 --> 00:02:53,906
The injustice of it all!

54
00:02:53,908 --> 00:02:56,275
  Oh, the wretched unfairness!

55
00:02:56,277 --> 00:02:59,478
  Expecting a lady of the court
    to maintain her standing

56
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:01,313
      with so few servants?

57
00:03:01,315 --> 00:03:04,783
         Oh! Can no one
     understand my hardship?

58
00:03:04,785 --> 00:03:07,452
            Uh, what?
       What am I wearing?

59
00:03:07,454 --> 00:03:08,820
        Is this a forest?

60
00:03:08,822 --> 00:03:10,989
      Wha-- But -- But how?

61
00:03:10,991 --> 00:03:12,691
             We were
     just in the Rustbucket.

62
00:03:12,693 --> 00:03:14,092
          Ben? Grandpa?

63
00:03:14,094 --> 00:03:16,028
Okay, okay.

64
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:17,930
I can figure this out.

65
00:03:17,932 --> 00:03:20,132
    But, first, I can't think
 with all these stupid ruffles.

66
00:03:20,134 --> 00:03:21,333
              Uhh!

67
00:03:21,335 --> 00:03:23,869
   First order of business --
       finding my family.

68
00:03:28,309 --> 00:03:31,009
Uh, Grandpa?

69
00:03:31,011 --> 00:03:34,947
           Maximus want eat pig!
         Girl make pig get away!

70
00:03:34,949 --> 00:03:37,616
         Maybe Maximus eat girl!

71
00:03:37,618 --> 00:03:41,420
     Uh, ha ha.
Okay, funny game, Grandpa.

72
00:03:41,422 --> 00:03:42,588
Princess!

73
00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:44,189
   The king has sent for you.

74
00:03:44,191 --> 00:03:45,891
    You must return at once.

75
00:03:45,893 --> 00:03:48,727
      Finish your business
      with this wilder-man.

76
00:03:48,729 --> 00:03:50,596
             Ben? The who, now?

77
00:03:52,466 --> 00:03:55,133
Forest belong to Maximus.

78
00:03:55,135 --> 00:03:57,603
Very well.

79
00:03:57,605 --> 00:04:00,339
               Prepare thyself
              for a trouncing.

80
00:04:07,481 --> 00:04:09,548
      Do you accept defeat, dog?

81
00:04:09,550 --> 00:04:12,184
Forests belong to Maximus!

82
00:04:13,621 --> 00:04:16,488
                 I have had
           enough of your games!

83
00:04:16,490 --> 00:04:18,423
               Away with you.

84
00:04:20,594 --> 00:04:22,594
Huh?

85
00:04:22,596 --> 00:04:23,795
    Am I wearing a wolf pelt?

86
00:04:23,797 --> 00:04:25,864
              Gwen?
     Gwen, what's going on?

87
00:04:25,866 --> 00:04:27,899
It's the reflections.
                  The what, now?

88
00:04:27,901 --> 00:04:29,434
Whoa!

89
00:04:29,436 --> 00:04:31,503
       Ben, what are you -- Aah!

90
00:04:31,505 --> 00:04:33,739
 You have to get him
to look at his reflection.

91
00:04:33,741 --> 00:04:37,676
            Uh, sure.
   Making it my top priority.

92
00:04:37,678 --> 00:04:40,646
   Okay, Ben, just
calm down and -- Whoa!

93
00:04:40,648 --> 00:04:42,147
   Look out, Gwen!

94
00:04:42,683 --> 00:04:44,783
         Oh!
      Uh, Ben.

95
00:04:44,785 --> 00:04:46,285
     You should have run off
         with your tail

96
00:04:46,287 --> 00:04:49,121
              between your legs
 while you still had the chance.

97
00:04:49,123 --> 00:04:50,088
           Wait. Stop!

98
00:04:50,090 --> 00:04:52,958
       Thou shalt not harm
           the, uh...

99
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:56,194
          man-beast --
    by order of the princess.

100
00:04:56,196 --> 00:04:57,896
             He said
    I was a princess, right?

101
00:04:57,898 --> 00:05:00,866
      You side with the wildling
          over the king's guard?

102
00:05:00,868 --> 00:05:02,467
                  Traitor!
                  So be it.

103
00:05:02,469 --> 00:05:06,405
       The great one shall judge
       this betrayal personally.

104
00:05:06,407 --> 00:05:07,673
        Uh, Ben, please.

105
00:05:07,675 --> 00:05:08,707
         This is no way
        to treat family.

106
00:05:09,977 --> 00:05:13,045
    Thou art no kin of mine,
           beast-man.

107
00:05:13,047 --> 00:05:15,781
           I trust there will be
          no further resistance?

108
00:05:15,783 --> 00:05:17,115
    What on earth
    is going on?

109
00:05:17,117 --> 00:05:19,685
What's wrong with Ben?
         I have no idea.

110
00:05:19,687 --> 00:05:22,721
 One minute, we're on our way to
 the Lactose Intolerance Museum.

111
00:05:22,723 --> 00:05:23,989
            The next,
   I'm waking up in the woods

112
00:05:23,991 --> 00:05:25,657
             wearing
     a frilly princess dress

113
00:05:25,659 --> 00:05:28,093
 and watching you wrestle a pig
  in fuzzy barbarian underwear.

114
00:05:28,095 --> 00:05:29,895
        Hmm.
If I didn't know better,

115
00:05:29,897 --> 00:05:32,130
I'd say it sounds like
 we were hypnotized.

116
00:05:32,132 --> 00:05:33,965
           Hypnotized?
        But who could --

117
00:05:33,967 --> 00:05:36,001
        What am I saying?
     It's Zombozo, isn't it?

118
00:05:37,538 --> 00:05:39,104
                What's this?

119
00:05:39,106 --> 00:05:42,674
  Looks like someone figured out
          how to break my spell.

120
00:05:42,676 --> 00:05:44,343
              Where'd you find
                a reflection?

121
00:05:44,345 --> 00:05:45,944
The river!

122
00:05:45,946 --> 00:05:47,979
             Oh, I knew I should
             have drained that.

123
00:05:47,981 --> 00:05:51,550
        Now, please don't ignore
     our special guest of honor.

124
00:05:51,552 --> 00:05:53,251
             Guest?

125
00:05:53,253 --> 00:05:54,986
        I don't know what
      you two are planning,

126
00:05:54,988 --> 00:05:56,822
          but you won't
       get away with this!

127
00:05:56,824 --> 00:05:58,256
    Yeah, we know
how to break your --

128
00:05:58,258 --> 00:06:01,159
          Silence! Don't talk to
    the king without permission.

129
00:06:01,161 --> 00:06:02,961
             I did your bidding
               again, my lord.

130
00:06:02,963 --> 00:06:04,396
          How do you wish for me
               to handle them?

131
00:06:04,398 --> 00:06:05,897
                Hoo-hoo-hoo!

132
00:06:07,301 --> 00:06:10,902
               Note to self --
       next throne, less stairs.

133
00:06:10,904 --> 00:06:12,504
   Why do you even
  want to be king?

134
00:06:12,506 --> 00:06:16,241
           I want to eat, relax,
        and be fancy, of course.

135
00:06:16,243 --> 00:06:19,044
              Idea!
      Tell you what, kiddo.

136
00:06:19,046 --> 00:06:20,746
          You're doing
        such a great job.

137
00:06:20,748 --> 00:06:24,883
 How about you decide what we do
  with the prisoners this time?

138
00:06:28,088 --> 00:06:29,821
              Ooh!
       He went Four Arms.

139
00:06:29,823 --> 00:06:32,491
     This is gonna be good.
        He's my favorite.

140
00:06:35,462 --> 00:06:36,762
                    Huh.
              It's just a hole.

141
00:06:36,764 --> 00:06:39,297
Good thing Ben not that's
creative, or we'd be in trouble.

142
00:06:39,299 --> 00:06:40,999
             Well, I don't care
             if he's hypnotized.

143
00:06:41,001 --> 00:06:42,567
                He's grounded
                 for a week.

144
00:06:44,838 --> 00:06:47,773
              Huh. What do you
              suppose that is?

145
00:06:47,775 --> 00:06:51,143
It's two dozen rabid badgers
that are about to join you...

146
00:06:51,145 --> 00:06:53,245
as soon as this rope
   burns through.

147
00:06:53,247 --> 00:06:55,013
        For once, Ben has
        proven me wrong.

148
00:06:55,015 --> 00:06:56,047
     That's really creative.

149
00:06:56,049 --> 00:06:57,516
          Hey, uh, brave knight.

150
00:06:57,518 --> 00:07:00,285
   I never noticed how strong
       and mighty you are.

151
00:07:00,287 --> 00:07:03,555
Flattery will not stop
 the badgers, girl.

152
00:07:03,557 --> 00:07:05,323
    I just mean to say, well,

153
00:07:05,325 --> 00:07:07,559
        you work so hard
     to protect the kingdom.

154
00:07:07,561 --> 00:07:09,060
                   Oh, oh.
                  Uh, yeah.

155
00:07:09,062 --> 00:07:11,997
              Much harder than
   the so-called king, at least.

156
00:07:11,999 --> 00:07:14,466
  What game do you
  traitors play at?

157
00:07:14,468 --> 00:07:17,068
       What game, indeed.

158
00:07:17,070 --> 00:07:18,670
              Look.
      What's he doing now?

159
00:07:18,672 --> 00:07:22,340
   I'll bet he's just having fun
      and bossing people around.

160
00:07:25,879 --> 00:07:29,381
  Ah, my lord is a,
 uh, very busy man.

161
00:07:29,383 --> 00:07:31,616
He --
- He hasn't done anything!

162
00:07:31,618 --> 00:07:34,152
  He just bosses people around
      and stuffs his face.

163
00:07:34,154 --> 00:07:38,156
It's true. He has been partaking
in much merriment today.

164
00:07:38,158 --> 00:07:41,626
               If you ask me,
    <i> you'd</i>be a way better king.

165
00:07:41,628 --> 00:07:44,129
  What you speak of
sounds like treason, girl.

166
00:07:44,131 --> 00:07:46,298
        Think of how much better
  it would be for the kingdom --

167
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:48,900
             big strong warrior
      like you running the show.

168
00:07:48,902 --> 00:07:50,635
    A real man of the people.

169
00:07:50,637 --> 00:07:52,771
Hmm.

170
00:07:52,773 --> 00:07:55,574
   Yes, I believe
I see what you mean.

171
00:07:55,576 --> 00:07:57,976
      Zombozo!

172
00:07:57,978 --> 00:08:01,213
A true king does more
than sit on his royal duff

173
00:08:01,215 --> 00:08:03,048
 and stuff his face.

174
00:08:03,050 --> 00:08:05,917
                Say what, now?
Consider this a coup!

175
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:09,521
        Watch it, ya big tomato!

176
00:08:09,523 --> 00:08:11,456
  Your move, clown.

177
00:08:11,458 --> 00:08:12,424
                     Oh!

178
00:08:12,426 --> 00:08:14,459
          Bit of advice for you,
                  kiddo --

179
00:08:14,461 --> 00:08:19,731
              Come at the king,
               best not miss.

180
00:08:24,404 --> 00:08:26,638
        Whoa!

181
00:08:28,308 --> 00:08:29,608
         Oh!

182
00:08:34,481 --> 00:08:36,214
                    Aah!

183
00:08:42,990 --> 00:08:44,623
What kind of trickery
      is this?

184
00:08:44,625 --> 00:08:46,625
               Magic trickery.

185
00:08:51,198 --> 00:08:53,932
  Whoa!
                Come on, kid.

186
00:08:53,934 --> 00:08:55,634
               You're supposed
              to be hypnotized.

187
00:08:55,636 --> 00:08:57,335
       Get back on Team Zombozo.

188
00:08:57,337 --> 00:09:00,071
        Sir Ben, a little faster
               would be nice.

189
00:09:00,073 --> 00:09:01,806
Overthrow him already!

190
00:09:01,808 --> 00:09:03,708
You're done giving orders.

191
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:05,544
          You can't question me.

192
00:09:05,546 --> 00:09:07,412
               I am your king.

193
00:09:17,424 --> 00:09:19,457
        Huh?

194
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:23,194
                What the heck
                is going on?

195
00:09:26,233 --> 00:09:27,966
       Hey, you guys okay?

196
00:09:27,968 --> 00:09:29,568
          Why you guys
       sitting in a hole?

197
00:09:29,570 --> 00:09:30,936
     Is there something cool
            in there?

198
00:09:30,938 --> 00:09:32,370
    I wanna sit in the hole.

199
00:09:32,372 --> 00:09:34,739
              He must have seen
     his reflection in my crown.

200
00:09:34,741 --> 00:09:36,741
              How unfortunate!

201
00:09:36,743 --> 00:09:39,077
           Make room.
         I'm coming in.

202
00:09:41,515 --> 00:09:45,584
               What? I thought
             I had him for sure.

203
00:09:52,926 --> 00:09:55,694
                  You will
             not screw this up.

204
00:09:57,297 --> 00:09:59,731
                  Come on.
    We were such a great team --

205
00:09:59,733 --> 00:10:01,132
              brains and brawn.

206
00:10:01,134 --> 00:10:04,603
        Stop avoiding your place
    as my double-right-hand man.

207
00:10:04,605 --> 00:10:09,074
Okay. Then how about
 you get over here?

208
00:10:14,314 --> 00:10:17,349
Aaahhh!

209
00:10:18,518 --> 00:10:21,252
            How did we end up in
   these gross Ren-fair clothes?

210
00:10:21,254 --> 00:10:23,154
         This isn't what I meant
                 when I said

211
00:10:23,156 --> 00:10:25,090
           I wanted more vintage
           stuff in my wardrobe.

212
00:10:25,092 --> 00:10:26,458
          Let's get out of here.

213
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:28,960
      Then you turned into
      a Shock Rock knight.

214
00:10:28,962 --> 00:10:30,562
           Grandpa was
       a savage barbarian.

215
00:10:30,564 --> 00:10:33,098
          Yeah, you locked us up
           in a crazy trap, too.

216
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:35,900
Sounds like I was pretty
cool -- and creative.

217
00:10:35,902 --> 00:10:37,502
       This is
really uncomfortable.

218
00:10:37,504 --> 00:10:39,571
   How did people
wear this back then?

219
00:10:39,573 --> 00:10:41,506
       Yeah, I was wearing
        some dumb dress.

220
00:10:42,743 --> 00:10:45,043
              Oh, I don't know.
          I don't mind my getup.

221
00:10:45,045 --> 00:10:47,612
        Great range of movement.
                Very freeing.

222
00:10:47,614 --> 00:10:51,016
  No! Get your hands off of me!
          I was a king!

223
00:10:51,018 --> 00:10:53,618
             A king!

224
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:55,120
      Don't fool yourself.

225
00:10:55,122 --> 00:10:57,589
     You were never a king.
