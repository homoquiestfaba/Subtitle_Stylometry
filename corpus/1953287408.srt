1
00:00:27,193 --> 00:00:28,558
She looks just like you.

2
00:00:28,594 --> 00:00:30,061
Kind of, right?

3
00:00:30,096 --> 00:00:32,257
Sure...in the cheekbones.

4
00:00:32,298 --> 00:00:33,560
Shut up.

5
00:00:33,599 --> 00:00:36,159
- No, she`s perfect.
- lsn`t she?

6
00:00:36,202 --> 00:00:37,464
It better go through.

7
00:00:37,503 --> 00:00:39,403
It will. The adoption people
are gonna love you.

8
00:00:46,212 --> 00:00:48,442
So, what do you wanna do?

9
00:00:48,481 --> 00:00:50,574
Well, this is nice...
what we`re doing.

10
00:00:50,616 --> 00:00:52,481
We could talk.
I like talking.

11
00:00:52,518 --> 00:00:54,577
Yeah... I`m not
that big on talking.

12
00:00:56,222 --> 00:00:57,450
Right.

13
00:00:57,490 --> 00:00:59,651
And...I`m not that into nice.

14
00:00:59,692 --> 00:01:00,784
Right.

15
00:01:01,494 --> 00:01:05,123
Wow, I just never thought you`d
be the first one to have a kid.

16
00:01:05,164 --> 00:01:06,722
Why? `Cause l`m barren?

17
00:01:06,766 --> 00:01:08,825
Are you ever gonna let that go?
I said like three years ago.

18
00:01:08,868 --> 00:01:10,096
Loudly...

19
00:01:10,136 --> 00:01:11,467
At my birthday party.

20
00:01:11,504 --> 00:01:13,335
I just thought it
was the correct term.

21
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:22,443
I meant that
when we were younger,

22
00:01:22,482 --> 00:01:25,508
you never wanted
to have kids, and I always did.

23
00:01:25,551 --> 00:01:27,212
You`d have to date a guy
longer than five minutes

24
00:01:27,253 --> 00:01:28,618
if you wanna have
a kid with one.

25
00:01:28,654 --> 00:01:30,645
It was five months. Okay?

26
00:01:30,690 --> 00:01:33,318
The last three,
lasted five to six months.

27
00:01:33,359 --> 00:01:35,156
So, yeah, let that sit.

28
00:01:35,194 --> 00:01:36,491
I`ll be right back.

29
00:01:48,674 --> 00:01:49,641
[phone beeps]

30
00:01:49,675 --> 00:01:51,643
Do you mind
if I take this text?

31
00:01:55,214 --> 00:01:56,841
It`s my best friend, Jenn.

32
00:01:58,151 --> 00:02:00,915
She just asked me
something really crazy.

33
00:02:01,154 --> 00:02:03,247
Yeah...
I don`t really care.

34
00:02:03,289 --> 00:02:05,917
Should we just...
should we just get right to it?

35
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:08,759
That`s cool. Okay.

36
00:02:17,803 --> 00:02:19,168
You know that thing

37
00:02:19,205 --> 00:02:20,797
when you`re looking
for sex on a hook-up site,

38
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:22,831
and you run into someone who`s
looking for something more,

39
00:02:22,875 --> 00:02:23,864
and you`re like...

40
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:26,276
this really
isn`t the place for this.

41
00:02:26,712 --> 00:02:28,907
Are we having that moment?

42
00:02:28,948 --> 00:02:33,908
No, it`s just that I haven`t
done this since my break-up.

43
00:02:35,454 --> 00:02:37,684
Oh...

44
00:02:37,723 --> 00:02:39,588
This isn`t gonna work.
I`m gonna go.

45
00:02:39,625 --> 00:02:41,718
I`m sorry.
It really has just been a while.

46
00:02:41,761 --> 00:02:43,251
Yeah, me too.
Not since Friday.

47
00:02:43,296 --> 00:02:45,628
But I have a backup so I might
still be able to catch him.

48
00:02:45,665 --> 00:02:46,859
Good.

49
00:02:46,899 --> 00:02:49,493
So, yeah...
Good luck.

50
00:02:51,470 --> 00:02:53,461
Well, it was nice to meet you.

51
00:02:53,506 --> 00:02:54,973
And...be safe.

52
00:02:59,612 --> 00:03:01,375
- Hey.
- Hey!

53
00:03:02,582 --> 00:03:03,708
You look really great!

54
00:03:03,749 --> 00:03:04,613
Oh, shut up.

55
00:03:04,650 --> 00:03:06,743
I`ve gained like four pounds
since you saw me last.

56
00:03:06,786 --> 00:03:08,481
No, you look good.

57
00:03:08,521 --> 00:03:09,715
Thanks.

58
00:03:09,755 --> 00:03:10,949
It`s all muscle.

59
00:03:12,458 --> 00:03:13,720
How`s the yoga studio?

60
00:03:13,759 --> 00:03:15,624
Oh, it`s good.
We`re doing Bikram now.

61
00:03:15,661 --> 00:03:16,855
Unofficially.

62
00:03:16,896 --> 00:03:17,828
Bikram...

63
00:03:17,863 --> 00:03:19,728
Is that the yoga
where they cook you?

64
00:03:19,765 --> 00:03:21,323
It`s hot yoga.

65
00:03:21,367 --> 00:03:22,356
Oh, yeah...

66
00:03:23,502 --> 00:03:24,332
You don`t like it?

67
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:25,997
I took a class once;
I didn`t like it.

68
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:28,764
For some people it`s
a very spiritual experience.

69
00:03:28,808 --> 00:03:31,470
Yeah, because they`re
dying of thirst.

70
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:36,912
- I missed you.
- I missed you too.

71
00:03:36,949 --> 00:03:39,247
It`s been a month.
That`s too long.

72
00:03:39,285 --> 00:03:40,445
Well, you moved to Brooklyn.

73
00:03:40,486 --> 00:03:41,783
Yeah, well--

74
00:03:41,821 --> 00:03:43,550
But I check your
status updates every day.

75
00:03:43,589 --> 00:03:45,614
You know Brooklyn
isn`t really that far.

76
00:03:45,658 --> 00:03:48,559
And I have an entire floor
for my comic book collection,

77
00:03:48,594 --> 00:03:50,357
so it`s actually really cool.

78
00:03:51,564 --> 00:03:53,464
So, what do you think?

79
00:03:53,499 --> 00:03:55,899
Well, l`m thinking about it.
That`s why l`m here.

80
00:03:55,935 --> 00:03:56,902
Thank you.

81
00:03:56,936 --> 00:03:58,528
We`ve been talking
about it forever.

82
00:03:58,571 --> 00:03:59,538
Yeah, I know.

83
00:03:59,572 --> 00:04:00,869
(both)
Since college, yeah.

84
00:04:01,974 --> 00:04:04,465
Were you thinking that you`d
just want it for yourself,

85
00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:06,307
or do you wanna share it?

86
00:04:06,345 --> 00:04:07,505
I wanna share it.

87
00:04:07,546 --> 00:04:08,604
You want to share
the responsibility?

88
00:04:08,648 --> 00:04:10,809
- lt`s a lot of responsibility.
- Yeah, I want to share it.

89
00:04:10,850 --> 00:04:13,284
And then we`ll get to see
each other more often.

90
00:04:13,319 --> 00:04:14,786
You`re sure you don`t wanna...
I don`t know...

91
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:17,380
wait around for the
right guy to come along?

92
00:04:17,423 --> 00:04:19,914
Wait around for the right
straight guy in New York City?

93
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:22,052
- I don`t know, get married?
- Married? Please.

94
00:04:23,296 --> 00:04:24,661
What about you?

95
00:04:24,697 --> 00:04:26,631
Have you been dating again?

96
00:04:26,666 --> 00:04:28,395
No...

97
00:04:28,434 --> 00:04:29,765
No, not since Tom.

98
00:04:29,802 --> 00:04:31,667
Yeah, he wasn`t right for you.

99
00:04:31,704 --> 00:04:34,434
Well, it took me about
six years to figure that out.

100
00:04:34,473 --> 00:04:35,565
Takes time.

101
00:04:36,342 --> 00:04:40,335
If we did this...
should we just call a doctor,

102
00:04:40,379 --> 00:04:42,404
and make an appointment
or something?

103
00:04:42,448 --> 00:04:44,439
No, I don`t want
to do fertility specialists.

104
00:04:44,483 --> 00:04:45,814
I watched my sister
go through that.

105
00:04:45,851 --> 00:04:48,081
Oh, yeah, poor Kelly.

106
00:04:48,321 --> 00:04:51,313
It`s so expensive, and I don`t
even really trust those doctors.

107
00:04:51,357 --> 00:04:53,825
They get things mixed up
like you wind up with...

108
00:04:53,859 --> 00:04:56,419
someone else`s baby,
someone else`s sperm.

109
00:04:56,462 --> 00:04:57,952
I can`t...
I can`t deal with that.

110
00:04:57,997 --> 00:05:00,522
So then should I just
go in the bathroom,

111
00:05:00,566 --> 00:05:01,931
jerk off into a cup,

112
00:05:01,967 --> 00:05:03,992
put it in a turkey baster
or something?

113
00:05:04,036 --> 00:05:05,094
No!

114
00:05:05,604 --> 00:05:07,765
I don`t even have
a turkey baster.

115
00:05:08,574 --> 00:05:10,599
Well, how do you wanna do this?

116
00:05:10,643 --> 00:05:13,441
I wanna do it
the old fashioned way.

117
00:05:15,881 --> 00:05:17,348
Surprise...

118
00:05:17,383 --> 00:05:19,010
Whoa! What?

119
00:05:20,853 --> 00:05:22,980
Are you just trying to get some?

120
00:05:23,022 --> 00:05:24,990
Gross! What? No!
Come on, we did this in college.

121
00:05:25,024 --> 00:05:26,787
Yeah, we did it in college,

122
00:05:26,826 --> 00:05:28,885
but we were really
drunk when we did it.

123
00:05:28,928 --> 00:05:30,486
Do you want to get really drunk?

124
00:05:30,529 --> 00:05:31,587
And you stopped
talking to me

125
00:05:31,630 --> 00:05:33,689
for like a whole month
afterwards, remember?

126
00:05:33,733 --> 00:05:35,758
You showed up at my
20th birthday party crying,

127
00:05:35,801 --> 00:05:36,768
and you ruined it.

128
00:05:36,802 --> 00:05:39,032
For the millionth time,
I am sorry.

129
00:05:39,071 --> 00:05:41,904
And I did not stop talking
to you because we had sex.

130
00:05:41,941 --> 00:05:43,431
Well, then why did you?

131
00:05:43,476 --> 00:05:45,603
Who remembers?
I certainly don`t.

132
00:05:45,644 --> 00:05:48,112
Hey, do you think that you can?

133
00:05:48,147 --> 00:05:50,012
Can what?

134
00:05:50,049 --> 00:05:51,607
Have sex with me?

135
00:05:51,650 --> 00:05:53,379
What is this - a dare?

136
00:05:53,419 --> 00:05:54,943
Yes, I can have sex with you.

137
00:05:54,987 --> 00:05:56,420
You can do it?

138
00:05:56,455 --> 00:05:57,615
Yes, I can.

139
00:05:57,656 --> 00:05:59,817
I`m a guy,
I can put it in anything.

140
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:03,520
Okay, then l`ll get
an ovulation kit,

141
00:06:03,562 --> 00:06:05,393
which tells you
when you`re ready.

142
00:06:05,431 --> 00:06:06,796
But according to my
lunar calendar,

143
00:06:06,832 --> 00:06:07,821
I`m about a week.

144
00:06:07,867 --> 00:06:09,664
And then l`ll just...
come over.

145
00:06:10,403 --> 00:06:11,836
You agreeing to this?

146
00:06:13,005 --> 00:06:14,734
I think I am.

147
00:06:15,107 --> 00:06:18,042
Yeah, then you`re just
gonna come on over,

148
00:06:18,077 --> 00:06:19,635
and we`re gonna make a baby.

149
00:06:19,945 --> 00:06:20,912
I stopped reading Spider-Man

150
00:06:20,946 --> 00:06:22,675
ever since he made
that deal with the devil.

151
00:06:22,715 --> 00:06:24,546
I was such
a huge Mary Jane fan.

152
00:06:24,583 --> 00:06:26,050
I don`t know why
they screwed that up.

153
00:06:26,085 --> 00:06:27,552
I`m sticking to the X Books.

154
00:06:27,586 --> 00:06:29,178
At least when Cyclops
psychically cheated

155
00:06:29,422 --> 00:06:30,753
with Emma Frost on Jean Grey,

156
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:32,485
who we all know
is the love of his life,

157
00:06:32,525 --> 00:06:34,015
at least there was
a little build up.

158
00:06:34,059 --> 00:06:35,424
It didn`t happen overnight.

159
00:06:35,461 --> 00:06:37,622
And they didn`t need the
devil to magically swoop in

160
00:06:37,663 --> 00:06:38,652
and say, oh,
suddenly you`re not--

161
00:06:38,697 --> 00:06:40,096
Hey, Tom.

162
00:06:40,132 --> 00:06:41,565
Hey, Matt.

163
00:06:42,768 --> 00:06:44,065
- Hi.
- Hey.

164
00:06:44,103 --> 00:06:45,934
It`s Thursday.
What are you doing here?

165
00:06:45,971 --> 00:06:47,165
You`re supposed to
come in on Wednesdays.

166
00:06:47,206 --> 00:06:48,639
I know, l`m sorry.

167
00:06:48,674 --> 00:06:50,039
I gave up my shift
on Wednesdays,

168
00:06:50,075 --> 00:06:52,066
so you could come in
on new book day.

169
00:06:52,111 --> 00:06:54,944
It`s cool because, you know,
we have a deal, so...

170
00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:56,811
So why are you here?

171
00:06:56,849 --> 00:06:58,510
Randall`s parents are in town.

172
00:06:58,551 --> 00:07:00,712
And you know how they
re-opened the crown

173
00:07:00,753 --> 00:07:02,118
over at the Statue of Liberty?

174
00:07:02,154 --> 00:07:03,553
You can go up there now.

175
00:07:03,589 --> 00:07:04,681
You should go it`s great.

176
00:07:04,723 --> 00:07:06,088
Who`s Randall?

177
00:07:06,859 --> 00:07:10,556
Oh, I thought Nelson
maybe would have told you.

178
00:07:10,596 --> 00:07:11,620
No.

179
00:07:11,997 --> 00:07:13,897
I met a new guy.

180
00:07:13,933 --> 00:07:15,662
Oh.

181
00:07:15,701 --> 00:07:17,601
- He`s Randall.
- Oh, cool.

182
00:07:17,636 --> 00:07:19,831
He`s really nice.
It`s been like a month.

183
00:07:19,872 --> 00:07:21,931
We met at the gym.

184
00:07:21,974 --> 00:07:24,067
Yeah, Nelson didn`t tell me.

185
00:07:25,044 --> 00:07:27,069
Did the new
Wonder Woman come out?

186
00:07:27,112 --> 00:07:29,979
It comes out next week...

187
00:07:30,015 --> 00:07:32,108
On Wednesday.

188
00:07:32,151 --> 00:07:34,085
Would you hold
a copy for me?

189
00:07:34,119 --> 00:07:35,711
Well, there`ll be
plenty of copies.

190
00:07:35,754 --> 00:07:37,984
Only gay guys
read Wonder Woman.

191
00:07:38,023 --> 00:07:39,752
I read it sometimes.

192
00:07:39,792 --> 00:07:42,522
Okay, l`ll come back on
Wednesday and l`ll pick that up.

193
00:07:42,561 --> 00:07:43,687
Yeah, great.

194
00:07:43,896 --> 00:07:44,828
Hey, l`m sorry.

195
00:07:44,864 --> 00:07:47,196
I`m sorry that I came in
on the wrong day.

196
00:07:50,769 --> 00:07:52,737
Is he your Jean Grey?

197
00:07:54,173 --> 00:07:56,698
I can`t believe
you didn`t ask me.

198
00:07:56,742 --> 00:07:58,209
Our child would be gaymazing.

199
00:07:58,244 --> 00:07:59,802
I know, but Matt`s
my best friend.

200
00:07:59,845 --> 00:08:00,812
I thought I was.

201
00:08:00,846 --> 00:08:04,509
You are my best friend...
from work.

202
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:06,643
Can he compete with this?

203
00:08:06,685 --> 00:08:08,243
Who could?

204
00:08:08,287 --> 00:08:09,777
Show me a picture.

205
00:08:12,291 --> 00:08:15,226
Jenn, Linda wants you to run
this bill to the post office.

206
00:08:15,261 --> 00:08:16,956
She said it needs
to go out ASAP.

207
00:08:16,996 --> 00:08:18,623
Why can`t you do it?

208
00:08:18,664 --> 00:08:19,756
I`m the receptionist.

209
00:08:19,798 --> 00:08:21,857
I have to sit at the
front desk and receive.

210
00:08:21,901 --> 00:08:23,198
I have a master`s degree.

211
00:08:23,235 --> 00:08:24,964
Why would I want to
be a messenger too?

212
00:08:25,004 --> 00:08:26,835
Can`t you get
someone else to do it?

213
00:08:26,872 --> 00:08:29,033
Linda feels that hierarchy
isn`t what we`re about here,

214
00:08:29,074 --> 00:08:30,564
so everyone has to chip in.

215
00:08:30,609 --> 00:08:32,236
This will be waiting
for you at the front desk.

216
00:08:33,178 --> 00:08:34,042
Fine.

217
00:08:35,047 --> 00:08:37,038
How do I always
get stuck doing this?

218
00:08:37,082 --> 00:08:38,845
Because I took on more classes
and more responsibility

219
00:08:38,884 --> 00:08:40,852
and made her stop treating
me like an assistant.

220
00:08:40,886 --> 00:08:43,184
Why are all
of his pictures shirtless?

221
00:08:43,222 --> 00:08:45,247
He gets hot easily.

222
00:08:47,092 --> 00:08:49,060
I can`t believe you
didn`t tell me about Randall.

223
00:08:49,094 --> 00:08:50,721
How is you knowing
who Tom`s dating

224
00:08:50,763 --> 00:08:51,923
gonna make
anybody`s day better?

225
00:08:51,964 --> 00:08:52,931
Especially mine.

226
00:08:52,965 --> 00:08:54,796
- What`s he like?
- Who cares?

227
00:08:54,833 --> 00:08:56,664
Why don`t we keep
the focus on you.

228
00:08:56,702 --> 00:08:58,101
When are you gonna
try dating again?

229
00:08:58,137 --> 00:09:01,197
Well, I joined one of those
websites and I had a date.

230
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:02,832
What kind of a date?

231
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:03,807
Which website?

232
00:09:03,842 --> 00:09:05,776
I am familiar
with many websites.

233
00:09:05,811 --> 00:09:08,837
I think it was
called Buddy Search.

234
00:09:08,881 --> 00:09:10,109
Dude Hunt.

235
00:09:10,149 --> 00:09:11,275
Yeah, that`s it.

236
00:09:11,317 --> 00:09:14,309
These sconces are so
whimsical and unique.

237
00:09:14,353 --> 00:09:15,718
How much for the pair?

238
00:09:15,754 --> 00:09:17,119
Those actually
don`t have a price.

239
00:09:17,156 --> 00:09:18,680
If you`re interested
you can leave a bid,

240
00:09:18,724 --> 00:09:19,952
and we`ll get back to you.

241
00:09:19,992 --> 00:09:22,119
Unique whimsy
is very in...

242
00:09:22,161 --> 00:09:23,150
right now.

243
00:09:23,596 --> 00:09:24,858
What`s with this beard?

244
00:09:24,897 --> 00:09:26,364
I`m becoming a bear.

245
00:09:26,599 --> 00:09:28,794
I`ve decided to explore my
butch and masculine sides.

246
00:09:28,834 --> 00:09:30,825
Aren`t those...
kind of the same thing?

247
00:09:30,869 --> 00:09:32,336
I have no idea.

248
00:09:32,371 --> 00:09:34,703
So, you`re a bear?

249
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:36,970
I`m here, l`m bear.
Get used to it.

250
00:09:37,009 --> 00:09:38,874
Woof... Paw.

251
00:09:39,878 --> 00:09:41,903
You should try something new.

252
00:09:41,947 --> 00:09:44,939
Well, how`s this for new?

253
00:09:44,984 --> 00:09:46,952
Jenn asked me to
have a baby with her.

254
00:09:46,986 --> 00:09:48,647
That is so Brooklyn.

255
00:09:48,687 --> 00:09:50,154
I`m actually getting
a little tired of lesbians

256
00:09:50,189 --> 00:09:51,884
asking me to
father their children.

257
00:09:51,924 --> 00:09:53,255
But the genes are good, girl.

258
00:09:53,292 --> 00:09:54,350
Jenn`s not a lesbian.

259
00:09:54,393 --> 00:09:55,621
Really?

260
00:09:55,661 --> 00:09:57,151
- Yeah, she`s not.
- Really?

261
00:09:57,196 --> 00:09:59,027
Yes, she`s not a lesbian.

262
00:09:59,064 --> 00:10:00,827
Did you say yes?

263
00:10:00,866 --> 00:10:02,993
Yes...
We`re gonna do it tomorrow.

264
00:10:03,035 --> 00:10:04,195
Wow.

265
00:10:04,236 --> 00:10:06,101
Do you wanna borrow some
porn for the doctor`s office?

266
00:10:06,138 --> 00:10:08,072
I downloaded all this
amazing 70s stuff.

267
00:10:08,107 --> 00:10:10,302
It`s all mustaches
and no condoms.

268
00:10:10,342 --> 00:10:12,003
We`re not gonna go to a doctor.

269
00:10:12,845 --> 00:10:14,745
We`re gonna have sex.

270
00:10:15,881 --> 00:10:18,145
Now that is whimsical.

271
00:10:18,183 --> 00:10:19,673
Have you had her tested?

272
00:10:19,718 --> 00:10:21,345
She`s fine.
It`s been discussed.

273
00:10:21,387 --> 00:10:23,184
She hasn`t had sex in a while.

274
00:10:23,222 --> 00:10:26,783
Well, it`s nice to see you`re
re-opening a closed location

275
00:10:26,825 --> 00:10:28,656
in these troubled times.

276
00:10:33,198 --> 00:10:35,029
Should I take my bra off?

277
00:10:35,067 --> 00:10:37,058
Oh, God, no,..

278
00:10:37,102 --> 00:10:40,037
Unless it`s
uncomfortable for you.

279
00:10:40,072 --> 00:10:42,165
I don`t have to do
anything with them, do l?

280
00:10:42,207 --> 00:10:45,301
No, no, no, no, no, no, no...
It`s fine.

281
00:10:45,344 --> 00:10:46,743
Good.

282
00:10:54,186 --> 00:10:55,414
Covers...

283
00:11:02,061 --> 00:11:04,052
I shaved my legs...

284
00:11:04,096 --> 00:11:06,758
but then I realized
I probably didn`t have to.

285
00:11:12,271 --> 00:11:13,397
Did you...

286
00:11:13,439 --> 00:11:17,933
wait a little bit
since the last time you...

287
00:11:17,976 --> 00:11:19,136
got off?

288
00:11:19,178 --> 00:11:22,875
People say that
when you wait a couple days...

289
00:11:22,915 --> 00:11:24,109
there`s more...

290
00:11:24,149 --> 00:11:27,846
Oh, that`s not really
a problem for me.

291
00:11:27,886 --> 00:11:29,080
Oh.

292
00:11:29,121 --> 00:11:31,316
I mean, some guys
actually say it`s too much.

293
00:11:31,356 --> 00:11:36,055
I think that the amount
will be perfect for this.

294
00:11:36,095 --> 00:11:37,426
Okay.

295
00:11:43,235 --> 00:11:45,100
I`m gonna take
my underwear off.

296
00:11:45,137 --> 00:11:46,365
Oh, yeah, me too.

297
00:11:57,883 --> 00:12:00,044
- So, I was thinking...
- Uh-huh.

298
00:12:00,085 --> 00:12:05,523
Um, that I could get started...
you know, outside...

299
00:12:05,758 --> 00:12:08,386
over here...
and get it ready...

300
00:12:08,427 --> 00:12:12,124
and when it`s just
about to happen,

301
00:12:12,164 --> 00:12:14,997
I could roll over and...
pop it in?

302
00:12:15,033 --> 00:12:17,126
Yeah, that sounds like a plan.

303
00:12:21,273 --> 00:12:25,300
I wanted to mention though,
I read somewhere that...

304
00:12:25,344 --> 00:12:29,337
if you enjoy it too,
then there`s more

305
00:12:29,381 --> 00:12:32,373
of a likelihood
that you`ll conceive.

306
00:12:32,417 --> 00:12:37,218
So, if you wanted to
do that on your side...

307
00:12:37,256 --> 00:12:39,451
while l`m doing it on my side

308
00:12:39,491 --> 00:12:41,391
I can probably do that later.

309
00:12:41,426 --> 00:12:44,190
In the bathroom,
by myself.

310
00:12:44,229 --> 00:12:45,821
I`m better by myself.

311
00:12:45,864 --> 00:12:46,853
Okay.

312
00:12:50,803 --> 00:12:52,031
Okay.

313
00:13:26,104 --> 00:13:27,196
How`s it going?

314
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:30,865
It`s beginning to respond.

315
00:13:30,909 --> 00:13:32,877
Can I peak? I`m wanna peak.

316
00:13:32,911 --> 00:13:34,105
I`m peaking.

317
00:13:34,146 --> 00:13:36,307
Oh...
I forgot how big you are.

318
00:13:36,348 --> 00:13:37,838
Come on, Jenn.

319
00:13:37,883 --> 00:13:39,214
You are so big.

320
00:13:39,251 --> 00:13:41,082
Jenn, you don`t have to do that.

321
00:13:41,119 --> 00:13:43,986
I`m not a straight guy.
You don`t have to stroke my ego.

322
00:13:44,957 --> 00:13:49,451
I mean it`s kind of true...
but l`ve seen bigger.

323
00:13:49,494 --> 00:13:51,121
Tom`s was huge.

324
00:13:51,163 --> 00:13:52,892
Is that who you`re
thinking about right now?

325
00:13:52,931 --> 00:13:55,331
It actually might be a little
bit easier if you didn`t talk.

326
00:13:55,367 --> 00:13:56,527
I`m sorry.

327
00:14:29,434 --> 00:14:31,527
[panting]

328
00:14:32,604 --> 00:14:33,662
- Okay.
- Okay?

329
00:14:33,906 --> 00:14:34,964
- lt`s happening.
- Okay.

330
00:14:35,007 --> 00:14:36,531
- l`m gonna come in.
- Okay.

331
00:14:36,575 --> 00:14:38,202
- l`m coming in.
- Don`t impale me.

332
00:14:38,243 --> 00:14:40,006
- lt`s gonna happen fast.
- Let me guide it.

333
00:14:40,045 --> 00:14:42,377
- All right, here we are.
- Yep.

334
00:14:44,049 --> 00:14:45,448
Ahhh...

335
00:14:52,491 --> 00:14:54,220
- Okay.
- Yeah.

336
00:15:12,210 --> 00:15:14,075
How many times do you
think we should do it?

337
00:15:14,112 --> 00:15:15,170
Five?

338
00:15:21,186 --> 00:15:23,654
Lifting up the right leg.
Hips squared.

339
00:15:24,256 --> 00:15:25,655
[moaning]

340
00:15:31,630 --> 00:15:33,530
[moaning]

341
00:15:38,737 --> 00:15:41,103
Oh, my, you`ve gone full-on
daddy but without the whole

342
00:15:41,139 --> 00:15:42,731
``old guy who used
to be hot`` thing.

343
00:15:42,975 --> 00:15:44,567
- Hey, bear.
- Woof.

344
00:15:44,609 --> 00:15:46,042
So how was proving to yourself

345
00:15:46,078 --> 00:15:47,477
that you could still
do it with a woman?

346
00:15:47,512 --> 00:15:48,740
It was surprisingly easy.

347
00:15:48,981 --> 00:15:50,471
We did it a couple days
in a row.

348
00:15:50,515 --> 00:15:52,483
It seemed so early
for a mid-life crisis,

349
00:15:52,517 --> 00:15:53,984
and yet here we are.

350
00:15:54,019 --> 00:15:56,544
You`ll be happy to know
that l`m off duty right now.

351
00:15:56,588 --> 00:15:57,577
Until next month.

352
00:15:57,622 --> 00:15:58,748
Then let`s find you a man.

353
00:15:58,991 --> 00:16:00,754
You need to cleanse your
palate after all that puss.

354
00:16:00,993 --> 00:16:02,585
- Excuse me.
- Hi.

355
00:16:02,627 --> 00:16:03,651
Can you help us out?

356
00:16:03,695 --> 00:16:05,094
Sure, what`s up?

357
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:07,360
I`m looking for some comics
for my son Parker here.

358
00:16:07,399 --> 00:16:10,232
Parker...
Like Peter Parker?

359
00:16:10,268 --> 00:16:11,496
Do you like Spider-Man?

360
00:16:12,671 --> 00:16:13,638
No.

361
00:16:13,672 --> 00:16:16,266
Okay... What kind
of books do you like?

362
00:16:16,308 --> 00:16:18,606
I like the Fantastic Four.

363
00:16:18,643 --> 00:16:21,237
Remember that cartoon?
What does the Thing say?

364
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:23,372
It`s clobbering time.

365
00:16:23,415 --> 00:16:24,780
That`s so cute.

366
00:16:26,284 --> 00:16:27,581
Do you have a kids` section?

367
00:16:27,619 --> 00:16:32,249
But no Spider-Man - we are
boycotting Spider-Man, right?

368
00:16:32,290 --> 00:16:34,520
Yeah, it`s over near there
near the action figures.

369
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:35,651
- Thanks.
- Sure.

370
00:16:40,432 --> 00:16:41,524
Say...

371
00:16:41,566 --> 00:16:43,397
Wow, young daddy`s kind of hot.

372
00:16:43,435 --> 00:16:44,629
Straight guys are not hot.

373
00:16:44,669 --> 00:16:46,136
We`re gay.
We like gay guys.

374
00:16:46,171 --> 00:16:47,433
We have self-esteem today.

375
00:16:47,472 --> 00:16:50,270
Oh, so that`s why you lower
your voice like three octaves

376
00:16:50,308 --> 00:16:51,798
every time you
meet someone cute?

377
00:16:52,044 --> 00:16:53,705
What can I say -
l`m naturally deep-voiced.

378
00:16:53,745 --> 00:16:55,406
I have to fight
to be this way with you.

379
00:16:55,447 --> 00:16:56,778
Well, you`d never know.

380
00:16:56,815 --> 00:16:59,545
Can we go get lunch now?
I want to eat myself fat.

381
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:05,380
Jenn, Linda wants you to pick
up her laptop at Tech-Place.

382
00:17:05,424 --> 00:17:06,618
They saved her drive.

383
00:17:06,658 --> 00:17:08,182
Okay, l`m on it.

384
00:17:08,226 --> 00:17:10,285
She said, no rush.
Just before five would be great.

385
00:17:11,063 --> 00:17:13,361
Valerie, I was working
on some new class ideas,

386
00:17:13,398 --> 00:17:15,559
and I thought that we
should offer prenatal.

387
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:18,296
But pregnant women aren`t
supposed to do hot yoga.

388
00:17:18,336 --> 00:17:20,634
But people have babies
in the desert all the time.

389
00:17:20,672 --> 00:17:22,833
But those people live in the
desert all the time,

390
00:17:23,075 --> 00:17:24,167
so they`re used to it.

391
00:17:24,209 --> 00:17:26,734
Well, I have a few clients
who would really be into it.

392
00:17:26,778 --> 00:17:29,406
Really? I don`t know.

393
00:17:29,448 --> 00:17:31,416
Just don`t forget the laptop.

394
00:17:32,617 --> 00:17:34,244
Already did.

395
00:17:40,092 --> 00:17:41,218
Hey, l`m out.

396
00:17:41,259 --> 00:17:42,851
You`re pouting.
What`s wrong?

397
00:17:43,095 --> 00:17:45,461
Valerie thinks that pregnant
women can`t handle hot yoga.

398
00:17:45,497 --> 00:17:46,555
Maybe she`s right.

399
00:17:46,598 --> 00:17:48,088
Are you gonna keep
teaching once you are?

400
00:17:48,133 --> 00:17:50,465
I do hot yoga all the time.
I`ll be fine.

401
00:17:50,502 --> 00:17:51,469
You will.

402
00:17:51,503 --> 00:17:52,834
But we don`t want
your baby coming out

403
00:17:52,871 --> 00:17:54,429
all twisty and toasty
like a pretzel.

404
00:17:54,473 --> 00:17:55,804
Oh, my God!
You should name him Pretzel!

405
00:17:55,841 --> 00:17:57,741
- What if it`s a girl?
- Pretzelle.

406
00:17:57,776 --> 00:18:00,472
No, no...
Lady Windermere.

407
00:18:00,512 --> 00:18:02,207
- I have to go.
- Bye.

408
00:18:02,681 --> 00:18:04,478
How long is it supposed to take?

409
00:18:04,516 --> 00:18:06,541
I think it said to wait
two to five minutes.

410
00:18:06,585 --> 00:18:08,712
But I don`t want to just
stand here and stare at it.

411
00:18:08,753 --> 00:18:11,517
Oh, my God...
We`re gonna know really soon.

412
00:18:11,556 --> 00:18:13,148
I know.

413
00:18:13,191 --> 00:18:15,216
Hey, you wanna go outside
on the roof and smoke?

414
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:17,251
I bought a pack of cigarettes
when I bought the test.

415
00:18:17,762 --> 00:18:19,696
We shouldn`t smoke.

416
00:18:19,731 --> 00:18:20,755
I mean, I can.

417
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:22,699
But you shouldn`t `cause
you might be pregnant.

418
00:18:22,734 --> 00:18:24,224
But our parents all smoke.

419
00:18:24,269 --> 00:18:27,136
Yeah, I blame all of
my lack of focus on that.

420
00:18:27,172 --> 00:18:29,640
Well, you can smoke
for the both of us.

421
00:18:29,674 --> 00:18:31,835
No. I`m just gonna hold it...

422
00:18:31,877 --> 00:18:33,435
In solidarity.

423
00:18:34,513 --> 00:18:36,811
I`m just
freaking out a little bit.

424
00:18:36,848 --> 00:18:39,146
What were we thinking?

425
00:18:39,184 --> 00:18:40,310
We can`t have a baby.

426
00:18:40,352 --> 00:18:42,547
We can`t afford
to have a baby.

427
00:18:42,587 --> 00:18:44,248
Even if I sold all of my comics,

428
00:18:44,289 --> 00:18:45,586
we couldn`t afford
to have a baby.

429
00:18:45,624 --> 00:18:46,921
I`ll have some money.

430
00:18:47,159 --> 00:18:48,558
What money?

431
00:18:48,593 --> 00:18:50,857
My grandmother left me
some money in a trust,

432
00:18:50,896 --> 00:18:52,523
for when I have
my first child.

433
00:18:52,564 --> 00:18:53,553
If, and when.

434
00:18:53,598 --> 00:18:54,758
Did you do this for money?

435
00:18:54,799 --> 00:18:56,164
No!

436
00:18:56,201 --> 00:18:59,398
No, I didn`t do this for--
I didn`t not think about it.

437
00:18:59,437 --> 00:19:00,836
How much money?

438
00:19:00,872 --> 00:19:02,396
It`s enough money.

439
00:19:02,908 --> 00:19:04,671
But it`s for the child,

440
00:19:04,709 --> 00:19:07,337
and you know my sister`s
going to make sure of that.

441
00:19:07,379 --> 00:19:09,472
But I didn`t do it
for the money.

442
00:19:09,514 --> 00:19:13,211
I did it because we are going
to have the fiercest gayby ever.

443
00:19:13,251 --> 00:19:14,479
Do people still say fierce?

444
00:19:14,519 --> 00:19:16,817
I think that actually
both parents have to be gay,

445
00:19:16,855 --> 00:19:18,755
in order for the
baby to be a gayby.

446
00:19:18,790 --> 00:19:20,553
Please, l`ve been
a hag since birth.

447
00:19:21,826 --> 00:19:23,555
Okay, we should check,
shouldn`t we?

448
00:19:23,595 --> 00:19:25,222
No. Not just yet.

449
00:19:25,263 --> 00:19:27,197
You know, it doesn`t matter...

450
00:19:27,232 --> 00:19:28,961
because if it`s a yes,
then great;

451
00:19:29,201 --> 00:19:31,396
and if it`s no,
then we`ll just do it again.

452
00:19:31,436 --> 00:19:32,630
- Really?
- Yeah.

453
00:19:33,438 --> 00:19:35,406
We`re gonna have our baby.

454
00:19:41,746 --> 00:19:44,306
Maybe this place isn`t
conducive to creating life.

455
00:19:45,850 --> 00:19:47,681
We could try
my place next time.

456
00:19:47,719 --> 00:19:49,914
Yeah, still, it`s so dreary.

457
00:19:51,523 --> 00:19:53,218
You really want this too,
don`t you?

458
00:19:53,258 --> 00:19:54,486
I do.

459
00:19:54,526 --> 00:19:56,221
I`ve always
wanted to have a kid.

460
00:19:56,261 --> 00:19:57,558
You know that.

461
00:19:57,596 --> 00:19:59,427
How else am I gonna do it?

462
00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:02,664
I started a new graphic novel.

463
00:20:02,701 --> 00:20:03,668
Oh.

464
00:20:03,702 --> 00:20:05,761
It`s about a baby,
or a gayby,

465
00:20:05,804 --> 00:20:09,331
who`s a baby by day,
and a superhero by night.

466
00:20:09,374 --> 00:20:10,739
You should show it
to one of those

467
00:20:10,775 --> 00:20:12,675
comic book bigwigs
who shops at your store.

468
00:20:12,711 --> 00:20:14,338
Yeah, I would...

469
00:20:14,379 --> 00:20:17,246
but I took the day off
when most of them come in,

470
00:20:17,282 --> 00:20:18,749
so I wouldn`t run into Tom.

471
00:20:18,783 --> 00:20:20,375
You need someone new.

472
00:20:20,418 --> 00:20:21,976
You should sign up
for online dating.

473
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:23,817
I`ve tried online dating.

474
00:20:23,855 --> 00:20:27,621
No, I mean the kind where
you actually go out on dates.

475
00:20:27,659 --> 00:20:29,957
- Oh, yeah.
- Yeah.

476
00:20:30,962 --> 00:20:33,021
Let`s both do it.
I`ll sign up again.

477
00:20:33,265 --> 00:20:34,027
Okay.

478
00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:37,290
Do you have any pictures
with your shirt on?

479
00:20:37,335 --> 00:20:39,326
Yeah, I think
there are like two.

480
00:20:39,371 --> 00:20:41,635
Well, you don`t want
to come off as too slutty.

481
00:20:41,673 --> 00:20:43,504
And don`t say you
like hiking and camping.

482
00:20:43,541 --> 00:20:45,031
When was the last
time you went camping?

483
00:20:45,277 --> 00:20:46,471
I like to camp.

484
00:20:46,511 --> 00:20:48,342
Yeah, camp...
Iike you appreciate

485
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:49,642
Valley of the Dolls
and Showgirls,

486
00:20:49,681 --> 00:20:51,342
but not like
in the freakin` woods.

487
00:20:51,383 --> 00:20:52,645
Well, can we keep hiking?

488
00:20:52,684 --> 00:20:54,982
Walking around in Central Park
late at night is totally hiking.

489
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:55,918
Sure.

490
00:20:55,954 --> 00:20:57,785
I`ve never done that
in my life, Nelson.

491
00:20:57,822 --> 00:20:59,551
What are we gonna
make your ad title?

492
00:20:59,591 --> 00:21:00,785
What did you use?

493
00:21:00,825 --> 00:21:03,055
Nelly Bear, `cause my
name`s Nelson and l`m a bear.

494
00:21:03,295 --> 00:21:05,388
Everyone`s gonna think
Nelly means feminine.

495
00:21:05,430 --> 00:21:07,990
Look, l`m trying to reconcile
my butch, bearded ferocity

496
00:21:08,033 --> 00:21:10,524
with my beautiful inner woman
in a tongue-in-cheek way.

497
00:21:10,568 --> 00:21:12,729
If people on this stupid site
don`t get it, it is their loss.

498
00:21:12,771 --> 00:21:13,897
Okay, okay.

499
00:21:13,938 --> 00:21:18,341
Well, then...
call me Matt-a-tat-tat,

500
00:21:18,376 --> 00:21:21,834
`cause l`m about to explode
onto the dating scene.

501
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:23,404
That works, right?

502
00:21:23,448 --> 00:21:25,473
I don`t think
that makes any sense.

503
00:21:25,517 --> 00:21:26,882
I love it.

504
00:21:27,085 --> 00:21:30,020
I think it`s nice,
it seems energetic.

505
00:21:30,055 --> 00:21:31,352
I`m on that site too.

506
00:21:32,390 --> 00:21:34,051
Actually, my name is
Naomi Malone...

507
00:21:34,092 --> 00:21:35,616
on the site.

508
00:21:35,660 --> 00:21:36,957
Showgirls.

509
00:21:36,995 --> 00:21:38,986
You know, do you think
it`s because like it`s...

510
00:21:39,030 --> 00:21:40,827
``No me l`m alone``?

511
00:21:40,865 --> 00:21:43,026
Like her existential angst
is so intense

512
00:21:43,068 --> 00:21:45,559
that there`s no ``me``
and she`s alone.

513
00:21:45,603 --> 00:21:47,366
- That`s beautiful.
- lsn`t that so intense?

514
00:21:47,405 --> 00:21:48,929
Like I thought about it
when I saw it the first time.

515
00:21:48,973 --> 00:21:50,668
I just like the dancing.

516
00:21:50,709 --> 00:21:51,733
Okay.

517
00:21:53,445 --> 00:21:55,606
The energy in my apartment
is just all wrong.

518
00:21:55,647 --> 00:21:56,614
You`re right.

519
00:21:56,648 --> 00:21:59,344
Your energy is
really murky, yellow.

520
00:21:59,384 --> 00:22:00,942
I meant in my apartment.

521
00:22:00,985 --> 00:22:02,543
It follows you.

522
00:22:02,587 --> 00:22:03,849
Well, what should I do?

523
00:22:03,888 --> 00:22:08,587
Oh, we can go shopping and
buy some candles, oils, sage.

524
00:22:08,626 --> 00:22:10,116
Sage helps you shift.

525
00:22:10,362 --> 00:22:12,853
Yeah, let`s do all that.
But I really need to paint.

526
00:22:13,531 --> 00:22:15,123
Oh, you should hire my brother.

527
00:22:15,367 --> 00:22:16,994
He paints apartments.
He`s really good.

528
00:22:17,035 --> 00:22:18,366
Jamie knows him.

529
00:22:18,403 --> 00:22:20,132
He takes my 5:30.
He`s amazing.

530
00:22:20,372 --> 00:22:21,896
We went on that men`s
healing retreat together.

531
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:23,532
I could set it up for you.

532
00:22:23,575 --> 00:22:25,008
Make sure he
gives you a good deal.

533
00:22:25,043 --> 00:22:26,738
Thanks, Linda,
that`s really great.

534
00:22:26,778 --> 00:22:28,143
No problem, sweetie.

535
00:22:29,013 --> 00:22:30,878
You guys should stick
around for Beth`s class.

536
00:22:30,915 --> 00:22:32,143
She`s got a really low count.

537
00:22:32,384 --> 00:22:33,874
It`d be nice to have
some extra bodies.

538
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:36,851
I didn`t know
she had a brother.

539
00:22:36,888 --> 00:22:38,480
He`s actually
a pretty serious artist.

540
00:22:38,523 --> 00:22:40,787
She never mentions that;
and he never mentions her.

541
00:22:40,825 --> 00:22:42,452
Weird. Is he nice?

542
00:22:42,494 --> 00:22:43,153
Not really.

543
00:22:43,395 --> 00:22:44,589
But he`s not mean either.

544
00:22:44,629 --> 00:22:47,063
He`s like...
opinionated and definite,

545
00:22:47,098 --> 00:22:49,032
in this very Pollock-y way.

546
00:22:49,067 --> 00:22:51,126
Is he gonna splash paint
all over my walls?

547
00:22:51,169 --> 00:22:52,397
No, Jennifer.

548
00:22:52,437 --> 00:22:53,495
He knows what he`s doing.

549
00:22:53,538 --> 00:22:55,506
Just don`t suggest
colors to him.

550
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:57,531
He feels the space,
and then decides.

551
00:22:57,575 --> 00:22:58,542
Okay--

552
00:22:58,576 --> 00:23:00,043
Just meet him.
He`s insanely hot.

553
00:23:00,078 --> 00:23:01,545
And moderately flexible.

554
00:23:01,946 --> 00:23:03,709
Is it weird that I don`t know

555
00:23:03,748 --> 00:23:05,511
what some of these initials
stand for anymore?

556
00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:07,074
Well, I think the Q
is questioning.

557
00:23:07,118 --> 00:23:08,710
Oh, well what`s the A?

558
00:23:08,753 --> 00:23:10,186
Is it answering?

559
00:23:10,422 --> 00:23:12,515
Are they
answering the questions?

560
00:23:12,557 --> 00:23:14,582
I think it might be asexual?

561
00:23:14,626 --> 00:23:16,719
Or like associates?

562
00:23:16,761 --> 00:23:18,058
I think it
basically encompasses

563
00:23:18,096 --> 00:23:19,654
all of New York City
at this point.

564
00:23:19,697 --> 00:23:21,665
Well, what makes this center
special anymore then?

565
00:23:21,699 --> 00:23:23,132
Well, they have gay bingo.

566
00:23:23,902 --> 00:23:24,869
I don`t know.

567
00:23:24,903 --> 00:23:26,768
I don`t want to do
any of these activities.

568
00:23:26,805 --> 00:23:28,636
But look -
they have your favorite:

569
00:23:28,673 --> 00:23:29,662
Gay camping!

570
00:23:29,707 --> 00:23:30,935
I don`t want to do that.

571
00:23:30,975 --> 00:23:33,773
Oh... Gay Republicans.

572
00:23:34,179 --> 00:23:36,147
Wow! That is so cool!

573
00:23:37,849 --> 00:23:39,976
Nelson, you shouldn`t do that.

574
00:23:40,018 --> 00:23:41,610
Why? Are you about
to tell me there`s room

575
00:23:41,653 --> 00:23:43,052
for all shades of gay
under the rainbow?

576
00:23:43,087 --> 00:23:43,951
`Cause there`s not.

577
00:23:43,988 --> 00:23:46,115
I was just gonna say there
are some really hot Republicans.

578
00:23:46,157 --> 00:23:47,920
I like having sex
with people I hate

579
00:23:47,959 --> 00:23:49,119
as much as
the next person,

580
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:50,752
but I had to give
that up in my 20s.

581
00:23:50,795 --> 00:23:51,693
[cell phone beeps]

582
00:23:51,729 --> 00:23:54,892
Oh, ooh...
I just got my tenth response.

583
00:23:54,933 --> 00:23:56,833
Do any of them
want to go hiking?

584
00:23:56,868 --> 00:23:58,130
How many did you get?

585
00:23:58,169 --> 00:23:59,864
What is this, a competition?

586
00:24:02,740 --> 00:24:05,732
Since yesterday, total?
Sixteen.

587
00:24:05,777 --> 00:24:07,711
I am so glad I went bear.

588
00:24:08,847 --> 00:24:10,712
And this is the bedroom.

589
00:24:15,653 --> 00:24:16,711
So?

590
00:24:18,890 --> 00:24:20,915
This place is depressing.

591
00:24:20,959 --> 00:24:22,017
Yeah.

592
00:24:22,060 --> 00:24:23,618
Can we change that?

593
00:24:23,661 --> 00:24:25,561
I`d kill myself
if I lived here.

594
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:44,145
- Green.
- What?

595
00:24:44,182 --> 00:24:45,615
I can help.

596
00:24:46,518 --> 00:24:47,280
Great.

597
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:52,847
Uh, should we...
talk about pay?

598
00:24:52,891 --> 00:24:54,620
No, you can`t afford me.

599
00:24:54,659 --> 00:24:56,889
But l`ll give you
the lowest price,

600
00:24:56,928 --> 00:24:58,987
since my sister said
you`re Jamie`s friend.

601
00:24:59,030 --> 00:25:01,260
Let`s not talk about money.
It`s not cool.

602
00:25:01,299 --> 00:25:02,266
Right.

603
00:25:05,103 --> 00:25:08,072
Should we...
talk about a schedule?

604
00:25:08,106 --> 00:25:10,199
I like to keep things loose.

605
00:25:10,241 --> 00:25:11,572
I`ll come when I feel it.

606
00:25:11,609 --> 00:25:12,576
Yeah.

607
00:25:15,213 --> 00:25:18,580
Well, maybe you should just
take an extra set of keys.

608
00:25:20,218 --> 00:25:22,049
Yeah, just put them
in my pocket.

609
00:25:43,007 --> 00:25:45,066
I`m just...
I`m gonna go to the supermarket.

610
00:25:45,109 --> 00:25:49,011
Uh, do you...
do you want anything?

611
00:25:49,047 --> 00:25:51,675
You know,
just lock up when you go.

612
00:25:52,750 --> 00:25:54,012
Dark yellow.

613
00:25:55,587 --> 00:25:58,317
Oh, you want to
paint the door yellow?

614
00:25:58,356 --> 00:26:00,187
Your aura.

615
00:26:00,224 --> 00:26:02,658
You think too much.

616
00:26:02,694 --> 00:26:04,127
Oh, I know.

617
00:26:05,029 --> 00:26:06,792
So I was like...
[giggling]

618
00:26:06,831 --> 00:26:08,958
Hold up. It`s not my fault
that you waited until

619
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,764
you were 40 to have kids
and wound up with a litter.

620
00:26:11,803 --> 00:26:13,236
And she had the nerve
to call me a bitch,

621
00:26:13,271 --> 00:26:14,363
which I found offensive

622
00:26:14,606 --> 00:26:16,198
because obviously
she was feminizing me,

623
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:19,334
and I do not stand for
hate language of any kind.

624
00:26:19,811 --> 00:26:21,972
You`re so strong,
silent and sexy.

625
00:26:22,013 --> 00:26:23,002
Let`s make out.

626
00:26:27,285 --> 00:26:29,879
Hmm! Uh...

627
00:26:29,921 --> 00:26:31,388
Could we keep it
above the waist?

628
00:26:31,623 --> 00:26:32,146
Come on.

629
00:26:32,190 --> 00:26:34,158
I made a promise to myself.

630
00:26:34,192 --> 00:26:35,887
Yeah, I didn`t promise a thing.

631
00:26:37,862 --> 00:26:39,853
[doorbell chimes]

632
00:26:40,865 --> 00:26:42,765
Let me just see who that is.

633
00:26:43,768 --> 00:26:45,360
You keep your clothes on.

634
00:26:49,641 --> 00:26:51,131
Jenn! Hi. What`s up?

635
00:26:51,175 --> 00:26:52,301
Is this a bad time?

636
00:26:52,343 --> 00:26:53,742
No, no.

637
00:26:53,778 --> 00:26:56,406
I`m on a date, but I could
kind of use a time-out.

638
00:26:56,648 --> 00:26:57,410
Hi.

639
00:26:58,282 --> 00:26:59,340
Hi.

640
00:27:00,084 --> 00:27:03,019
Jenn, this is...

641
00:27:03,054 --> 00:27:04,419
It`s Adrian.

642
00:27:04,656 --> 00:27:07,318
And this is
my friend Jenn, who...

643
00:27:07,358 --> 00:27:08,416
she brought a suitcase.

644
00:27:08,660 --> 00:27:10,025
Why did you bring
a suitcase, Jenn?

645
00:27:10,061 --> 00:27:11,187
You didn`t get my email?

646
00:27:11,229 --> 00:27:12,355
No, when did you send it?

647
00:27:12,397 --> 00:27:13,887
Like twenty minutes ago.

648
00:27:13,931 --> 00:27:16,422
Oh, I didn`t get it cause
I had turned my phone off,

649
00:27:16,668 --> 00:27:20,263
so I could give
my full attention to...

650
00:27:20,304 --> 00:27:21,271
Adrian.

651
00:27:21,305 --> 00:27:23,432
Matt always forgets names
when he first meets people.

652
00:27:23,675 --> 00:27:25,074
His mom smoked
when she was pregnant.

653
00:27:25,109 --> 00:27:27,134
- Jenn.
- What? It`s true.

654
00:27:27,178 --> 00:27:29,078
Oh, and l`m having my
apartment painted,

655
00:27:29,113 --> 00:27:30,910
and it`s not good for me
to be around the fumes

656
00:27:30,948 --> 00:27:32,415
when we`re trying
to have a baby.

657
00:27:32,450 --> 00:27:34,850
Jenn and I are
trying to have a baby.

658
00:27:34,886 --> 00:27:36,786
Oh, the city needs
more children.

659
00:27:38,923 --> 00:27:40,686
So, can I stay for a few days?

660
00:27:40,725 --> 00:27:41,953
Yeah, sure.

661
00:27:41,993 --> 00:27:43,927
Oh, and I think
today is day one.

662
00:27:43,961 --> 00:27:45,326
I thought it was
gonna be tomorrow,

663
00:27:45,363 --> 00:27:47,763
but the thermometer
says that it`s today.

664
00:27:47,799 --> 00:27:49,824
That is so my cue to leave.

665
00:27:50,835 --> 00:27:52,462
Thanks for getting him ready.

666
00:27:52,704 --> 00:27:53,932
Sure.

667
00:27:53,971 --> 00:27:55,700
Have fun breeding.

668
00:27:57,108 --> 00:27:58,803
I`m sorry.
It was really good to meet you.

669
00:27:59,977 --> 00:28:01,069
[sighs]

670
00:28:04,982 --> 00:28:07,348
Sorry I chased away Adrian.
He was cute.

671
00:28:07,385 --> 00:28:08,909
Oh, it`s okay.

672
00:28:08,953 --> 00:28:11,319
I have a date
every night this week.

673
00:28:11,355 --> 00:28:15,314
It`s getting hard to schedule
because of all the responses.

674
00:28:16,227 --> 00:28:18,821
I have a date with
one of my two responses.

675
00:28:19,964 --> 00:28:22,489
Well, you have him
meet you here, missy,

676
00:28:22,734 --> 00:28:25,362
because my baby mama
doesn`t go out with anyone

677
00:28:25,403 --> 00:28:27,894
unless I meet him first,
you understand me?

678
00:28:27,939 --> 00:28:28,906
Yes, daddy.

679
00:28:28,940 --> 00:28:31,067
Just before our date
he should meet my gay lover.

680
00:28:31,876 --> 00:28:32,843
That`s right.

681
00:28:32,877 --> 00:28:34,208
Wait, were you gonna
have sex with Adrian?

682
00:28:34,245 --> 00:28:35,234
No...

683
00:28:35,279 --> 00:28:37,509
God, I just kissed him
so he`d shut up.

684
00:28:38,216 --> 00:28:40,377
You`re the only man for me.

685
00:28:40,418 --> 00:28:43,012
- Aw.
- lt`s true.

686
00:28:43,054 --> 00:28:44,521
- Let`s spoon.
- Okay.

687
00:28:47,959 --> 00:28:49,119
Okay.

688
00:28:55,066 --> 00:28:56,966
I mean...

689
00:28:57,001 --> 00:28:58,468
Just a little tighter.

690
00:29:03,808 --> 00:29:05,241
[door squeaks open]

691
00:29:07,011 --> 00:29:09,946
Wow, that`s...
that`s, really good.

692
00:29:09,981 --> 00:29:11,107
- Hey.
- Hey.

693
00:29:11,149 --> 00:29:13,140
How did Parker like the books?

694
00:29:13,184 --> 00:29:14,173
Good memory.

695
00:29:14,218 --> 00:29:16,277
He sent me back for more.
I think he`s hooked.

696
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:18,015
- That`s great.
- Yeah.

697
00:29:18,055 --> 00:29:20,319
I`m gonna be closing soon,
so feel free to look around.

698
00:29:20,358 --> 00:29:21,916
- Sure.
- l`ll just lock up.

699
00:29:21,959 --> 00:29:22,948
Okay.

700
00:29:24,061 --> 00:29:27,053
This is the best out of what
we have that`s age appropriate.

701
00:29:27,098 --> 00:29:30,033
Wow, that`s great.
Thank you so much.

702
00:29:30,067 --> 00:29:32,228
Anything good come out
this week for adults?

703
00:29:32,270 --> 00:29:34,898
- The new FF is really great.
- Yeah?

704
00:29:34,939 --> 00:29:37,305
Susan is totally
flirting with Namor,

705
00:29:37,341 --> 00:29:40,139
who I always thought
was a lot cooler than Reed.

706
00:29:40,178 --> 00:29:41,475
Oh, come on!

707
00:29:41,512 --> 00:29:43,377
I mean sure,
Mr. Fantastic is nerdy,

708
00:29:43,414 --> 00:29:47,316
but he can stretch any part
of his body any way he wants.

709
00:29:47,351 --> 00:29:51,048
So, I mean how could she
not be satisfied at home?

710
00:29:51,088 --> 00:29:52,885
That`s true.

711
00:29:52,924 --> 00:29:55,256
I always kinda had
a thing for Johnny.

712
00:29:55,293 --> 00:29:57,124
- Oh, yeah, he`s hot.
- Right?

713
00:29:57,161 --> 00:29:59,186
I mean he is the Human Torch.

714
00:29:59,230 --> 00:30:00,959
So, is he your favorite?

715
00:30:00,998 --> 00:30:02,260
Yeah...

716
00:30:03,835 --> 00:30:06,599
I like the way
Derington draws his ass.

717
00:30:10,208 --> 00:30:11,937
Are you flirting with me?

718
00:30:11,976 --> 00:30:13,534
What made you think that?

719
00:30:15,446 --> 00:30:17,346
Oh... I`m sorry.

720
00:30:17,381 --> 00:30:19,212
I feel dumb.

721
00:30:19,250 --> 00:30:22,048
I always think it`s
happening when it`s not,

722
00:30:22,086 --> 00:30:24,213
and then when it actually is
happening, I have no idea.

723
00:30:24,922 --> 00:30:26,184
It`s okay.

724
00:30:27,525 --> 00:30:28,992
It`s happening.

725
00:30:35,266 --> 00:30:38,235
What does the Human Torch say?

726
00:30:40,037 --> 00:30:42,096
He says, ``Flame on.``

727
00:30:50,882 --> 00:30:51,940
I`m sorry--

728
00:30:51,983 --> 00:30:54,281
You have a wife and a son.

729
00:30:54,318 --> 00:30:56,309
I don`t go down low.

730
00:30:56,354 --> 00:30:59,482
I think it`s...
I don`t do down low.

731
00:30:59,523 --> 00:31:01,354
I don`t...
I don`t do that either.

732
00:31:01,392 --> 00:31:02,518
Yeah, l`m divorced.

733
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:04,425
And my son`s with
his mom so l`m...

734
00:31:04,462 --> 00:31:05,656
Are you out?

735
00:31:06,597 --> 00:31:08,622
I... I am now.

736
00:31:16,941 --> 00:31:18,408
I can`t do this here.

737
00:31:18,442 --> 00:31:19,670
It`s just too weird.

738
00:31:19,911 --> 00:31:21,071
You wanna go back to my place?

739
00:31:21,112 --> 00:31:22,409
- Yeah, where`s your place?
- Like ten blocks away.

740
00:31:22,446 --> 00:31:24,038
Okay. Wait, that sounds
like kind of far.

741
00:31:24,081 --> 00:31:25,048
Yeah.

742
00:31:31,322 --> 00:31:32,914
Can we just
keep it above the waist?

743
00:31:32,957 --> 00:31:34,117
Oh, yeah, yeah.

744
00:31:34,158 --> 00:31:35,682
No down low...
Either way.

745
00:31:40,598 --> 00:31:42,190
[doorbell chimes]

746
00:31:44,669 --> 00:31:46,660
Please tell me
you`re here for me.

747
00:31:46,704 --> 00:31:48,103
I`m here for you.

748
00:31:48,139 --> 00:31:49,436
You`re not here for me,
are you?

749
00:31:49,473 --> 00:31:50,963
And you`re not Matt, are you?

750
00:31:51,008 --> 00:31:52,942
- No, l`m Jenn.
- l`m Daniel.

751
00:31:52,977 --> 00:31:54,308
- Hello, Daniel.
- Hi.

752
00:31:54,345 --> 00:31:56,006
Matt`s still at work,
he`ll be back home soon.

753
00:31:56,047 --> 00:31:57,036
You want to go and sit down?

754
00:31:57,081 --> 00:31:58,446
Yeah, sure. Thanks.

755
00:32:02,954 --> 00:32:05,320
I gotta finish my makeup -
for my date.

756
00:32:05,356 --> 00:32:07,586
- You look great to me.
- Thank you.

757
00:32:07,625 --> 00:32:09,217
I might have to switch teams.

758
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:10,488
Story of my life.

759
00:32:10,528 --> 00:32:11,552
Aw.

760
00:32:11,595 --> 00:32:12,687
We`ll see about that.

761
00:32:14,966 --> 00:32:15,728
[doorbell chimes]

762
00:32:15,967 --> 00:32:18,197
Daniel! Can you get that?

763
00:32:18,235 --> 00:32:19,202
Sure.

764
00:32:23,374 --> 00:32:25,001
Hi...

765
00:32:25,042 --> 00:32:26,168
Jenn?

766
00:32:26,210 --> 00:32:27,472
How`d you guess?

767
00:32:27,511 --> 00:32:28,637
Be right out!

768
00:32:29,380 --> 00:32:31,075
- Do you wanna sit down?
- Sure.

769
00:32:35,486 --> 00:32:37,215
Things are looking up.

770
00:32:41,125 --> 00:32:43,252
I`m gonna go to the bathroom...

771
00:32:43,294 --> 00:32:45,057
Unless you need to.

772
00:32:45,096 --> 00:32:47,257
No, I did already...

773
00:32:47,298 --> 00:32:48,697
In the hallway.

774
00:32:51,235 --> 00:32:52,224
Okay.

775
00:33:01,012 --> 00:33:01,740
Daniel...

776
00:33:01,779 --> 00:33:03,406
No. I`m Adam.

777
00:33:03,447 --> 00:33:04,744
Dan`s in the bathroom.

778
00:33:04,782 --> 00:33:06,010
I`m here for Jenn.

779
00:33:06,050 --> 00:33:07,779
Dan`s a looker though.
Score.

780
00:33:08,019 --> 00:33:09,509
- So he is here?
- Yes, he is.

781
00:33:09,553 --> 00:33:10,520
Damn.

782
00:33:12,490 --> 00:33:13,514
You`re late.

783
00:33:13,557 --> 00:33:15,184
I totally forgot I had a date.

784
00:33:15,226 --> 00:33:16,386
How could you
forget you have a date?

785
00:33:16,427 --> 00:33:18,520
You have a date every night.
Who forgets that?

786
00:33:18,562 --> 00:33:20,530
Date... Every... Night.

787
00:33:20,564 --> 00:33:22,293
You look really pretty.

788
00:33:22,333 --> 00:33:23,391
Thanks.

789
00:33:23,434 --> 00:33:24,594
I met Adam.

790
00:33:24,635 --> 00:33:26,034
He seems nice and cute.

791
00:33:26,070 --> 00:33:27,628
Oh, I haven`t seen him yet.
But I saw Daniel.

792
00:33:27,671 --> 00:33:29,263
He`s adorable.
You wanna trade?

793
00:33:29,306 --> 00:33:31,137
I think l`m tired of dating.

794
00:33:31,175 --> 00:33:32,403
Your life is hard.

795
00:33:33,144 --> 00:33:34,736
Oh, I should probably
have sex tonight.

796
00:33:36,047 --> 00:33:39,073
You`re gonna have sex with
that guy on the first date?

797
00:33:39,116 --> 00:33:40,276
You better use a condom.

798
00:33:40,317 --> 00:33:42,342
Thanks, dad.
I meant us.

799
00:33:42,386 --> 00:33:43,819
Oh, right.

800
00:33:44,055 --> 00:33:46,819
Yeah, just text me and let me
know how your date is going,

801
00:33:47,058 --> 00:33:49,549
and then l`ll end mine
around the same time.

802
00:33:49,593 --> 00:33:50,685
- Okay?
- Okay.

803
00:33:50,728 --> 00:33:52,662
Well, let`s go meet
our gentlemen callers.

804
00:33:52,696 --> 00:33:53,663
Okay.

805
00:33:59,703 --> 00:34:02,365
Well, you`re welcome
to come in if you want,

806
00:34:02,406 --> 00:34:05,273
but I have to let you go
when my friend comes home.

807
00:34:05,309 --> 00:34:07,834
Well, we could always go
back to my place in Astoria.

808
00:34:08,079 --> 00:34:09,239
I mean, if you want.

809
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:11,771
As tempting as that sounds,
I can`t.

810
00:34:12,683 --> 00:34:14,617
Astoria is very tempting.

811
00:34:14,652 --> 00:34:18,088
I told my friend Jenn that
l`d be here when she gets home.

812
00:34:18,823 --> 00:34:21,348
Well, maybe we can
meet up again sometime?

813
00:34:21,392 --> 00:34:22,324
Yeah.

814
00:34:23,794 --> 00:34:25,421
Hi, guys!

815
00:34:25,463 --> 00:34:26,452
How was your date?

816
00:34:26,497 --> 00:34:27,589
It was nice.

817
00:34:27,631 --> 00:34:28,859
It was really nice.

818
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:30,465
How was your date?

819
00:34:31,635 --> 00:34:33,193
What did you guys do?

820
00:34:33,237 --> 00:34:35,205
We had Moroccan.

821
00:34:35,239 --> 00:34:38,208
- Date... You get it?
- Stuffed dates.

822
00:34:38,242 --> 00:34:39,209
Oh.

823
00:34:39,243 --> 00:34:41,609
Did you get stuffed...
Date?

824
00:34:41,645 --> 00:34:43,840
You know, you`re funny.

825
00:34:43,881 --> 00:34:45,348
I... You`re funny.

826
00:34:45,382 --> 00:34:46,610
Yeah, but you`re more funny.

827
00:34:46,650 --> 00:34:48,242
I`m funny.
You know what you are?

828
00:34:48,285 --> 00:34:50,480
- What?
- You`re Moroccan.

829
00:34:50,521 --> 00:34:53,319
- Ah...
- Mo` rockin.

830
00:34:53,357 --> 00:34:56,121
- You`re Mo` rockin.
- I like that.

831
00:34:56,160 --> 00:34:57,889
- Show em the feet.
- All right.

832
00:34:58,129 --> 00:34:59,289
- Do the feet.
- Ready?

833
00:35:00,498 --> 00:35:02,591
[soft-shoe tapping]

834
00:35:06,437 --> 00:35:09,201
- Yeah, I wanna see you again.
- I wanna see you again.

835
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:10,639
We`re going on a second date.

836
00:35:10,674 --> 00:35:11,902
You going on a second date?

837
00:35:12,143 --> 00:35:13,804
Okay, Jenn, I think
you should get to bed.

838
00:35:13,844 --> 00:35:16,506
No, you go to the bed
and l`ll be in in a minute.

839
00:35:16,547 --> 00:35:18,344
I wanna make out
with the Adam.

840
00:35:18,382 --> 00:35:19,508
Ooh...

841
00:35:19,550 --> 00:35:21,643
- Okay.
- Here.

842
00:35:23,487 --> 00:35:26,388
Well...

843
00:35:26,423 --> 00:35:28,391
It was nice to meet you.

844
00:35:28,425 --> 00:35:30,393
Yes, it was nice
to meet you too.

845
00:35:32,863 --> 00:35:33,921
This way.

846
00:35:34,165 --> 00:35:34,927
Should l?

847
00:35:35,166 --> 00:35:36,793
No, no it`s fine.

848
00:35:36,834 --> 00:35:38,461
I`ll email you sometime, okay?

849
00:35:48,812 --> 00:35:50,279
Woo...

850
00:35:50,314 --> 00:35:51,281
Oh...

851
00:35:51,315 --> 00:35:53,806
It helps to have someone get
you all revved up before that.

852
00:35:56,287 --> 00:35:57,948
Daniel didn`t rev me up.

853
00:35:58,622 --> 00:36:00,681
How could you not like Daniel?

854
00:36:00,724 --> 00:36:02,385
I thought he was
really cute and really fun.

855
00:36:02,426 --> 00:36:04,451
Didn`t you think
he was cute, fun?

856
00:36:04,495 --> 00:36:05,757
Yeah, he was nice.

857
00:36:05,796 --> 00:36:09,425
Adam wasn`t so nice.
That`s why I liked him.

858
00:36:09,466 --> 00:36:12,196
I think I like someone else.

859
00:36:12,236 --> 00:36:13,828
The guy from last night?

860
00:36:13,871 --> 00:36:15,566
No...from today.

861
00:36:16,473 --> 00:36:19,738
There was another one
from today?

862
00:36:19,777 --> 00:36:21,404
He came into the store.

863
00:36:21,445 --> 00:36:23,470
A comic geek,
like nerdy sexy?

864
00:36:23,514 --> 00:36:24,947
Yeah, kinda.

865
00:36:24,982 --> 00:36:26,745
At first I thought
he was straight,

866
00:36:26,784 --> 00:36:29,514
but then it turned out
he was bi or gay.

867
00:36:29,553 --> 00:36:31,578
I actually don`t even
know what he was.

868
00:36:31,622 --> 00:36:34,785
Maybe he was A...
whatever that means.

869
00:36:34,825 --> 00:36:36,884
A? A is for ally.
I`m A.

870
00:36:36,927 --> 00:36:39,452
I`m ally. I earned that.
Don`t give that to him.

871
00:36:40,497 --> 00:36:42,829
Adam begins with an A.

872
00:36:42,866 --> 00:36:45,391
He gets an A in tongue.

873
00:36:45,436 --> 00:36:47,461
Yeah, so does Scott.

874
00:36:47,504 --> 00:36:50,234
He graduates Magna Cum Hot-tay.

875
00:36:51,742 --> 00:36:53,437
Jenn, your sister`s here.

876
00:36:53,477 --> 00:36:55,308
I put her in Studio B.
Hurry it up.

877
00:36:55,779 --> 00:36:57,474
My sister`s here?

878
00:36:57,514 --> 00:36:58,845
Oh, that`s never a good thing.

879
00:37:00,351 --> 00:37:02,376
Jamie, you have to
hold this for a minute.

880
00:37:02,419 --> 00:37:03,681
But you peed on that thing.

881
00:37:03,721 --> 00:37:05,552
That`s not the side I peed on.

882
00:37:05,589 --> 00:37:07,580
But still... Yuck.

883
00:37:12,663 --> 00:37:14,858
What is with
these ridiculous chairs?

884
00:37:14,898 --> 00:37:16,729
We just taught a kids` class.

885
00:37:16,767 --> 00:37:18,758
Please just don`t say kids
to me right now.

886
00:37:18,802 --> 00:37:20,702
Why? What`s wrong?

887
00:37:20,738 --> 00:37:22,706
- There`s a problem with Sadie.
- Who`s Sadie?

888
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:24,708
The child l`m adopting.
Come on, keep up here.

889
00:37:24,742 --> 00:37:26,642
Wait, I thought
her name was Folasade.

890
00:37:26,677 --> 00:37:28,508
Yeah, I don`t like that.

891
00:37:28,545 --> 00:37:29,978
It sounds like Folic acid.

892
00:37:30,014 --> 00:37:31,743
Why? Sade for short is so cute.

893
00:37:31,782 --> 00:37:33,306
I did give it some thought.

894
00:37:33,350 --> 00:37:35,375
Sadie is close
enough to her birth name.

895
00:37:35,419 --> 00:37:36,886
Yeah, right.

896
00:37:39,556 --> 00:37:41,683
Where did you just go?
In your head?

897
00:37:41,725 --> 00:37:42,714
Oh, nowhere.

898
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:45,024
You just reminded me that
I needed to get vitamins.

899
00:37:45,062 --> 00:37:46,552
My adoption might
be falling apart,

900
00:37:46,597 --> 00:37:47,996
and you`re worried about
your shopping list.

901
00:37:48,032 --> 00:37:48,896
I`m sorry.

902
00:37:48,932 --> 00:37:50,923
They told you it was gonna
be a long, drawn out process.

903
00:37:50,968 --> 00:37:52,401
But you know it`s gonna happen.

904
00:37:52,436 --> 00:37:52,925
I know.

905
00:37:52,970 --> 00:37:54,801
I just can`t take
much more of this.

906
00:37:54,838 --> 00:37:57,068
I really want her
to be here, now.

907
00:37:58,542 --> 00:38:00,407
I`m ready to mother.

908
00:38:00,444 --> 00:38:02,503
Look I got this great book
so that we`ll be ready

909
00:38:02,546 --> 00:38:04,070
when she starts
to ask questions.

910
00:38:04,315 --> 00:38:05,339
She`s a year old.

911
00:38:05,382 --> 00:38:06,940
What questions
is she going to ask?

912
00:38:06,984 --> 00:38:09,077
We need to be sensitive
about the issues that arise

913
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:11,584
when Americans adopt
children from other cultures.

914
00:38:11,622 --> 00:38:14,455
So I should let her grow up in
an orphanage to avoid issues?

915
00:38:14,491 --> 00:38:15,822
- That`s not what I meant.
- I know what you meant.

916
00:38:15,859 --> 00:38:17,622
I`m white, she`s black,
so l`m gonna need you

917
00:38:17,661 --> 00:38:18,992
to come over
and explain it to her.

918
00:38:19,029 --> 00:38:21,623
I can`t wait. You can teach her
about hip-hop and civil rights.

919
00:38:21,665 --> 00:38:23,428
Did you just come here to argue?

920
00:38:23,467 --> 00:38:24,559
No.

921
00:38:24,601 --> 00:38:27,468
You`re going on a date with
my friend Peter next Thursday.

922
00:38:27,504 --> 00:38:29,597
You`ll love it.
He is a font of information.

923
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:31,870
He`s been to Africa,
multiple times.

924
00:38:31,909 --> 00:38:32,876
I don`t know.

925
00:38:32,910 --> 00:38:34,571
Do not say no to me today.

926
00:38:34,611 --> 00:38:35,908
Fine. I`ll go.

927
00:38:37,014 --> 00:38:39,346
And don`t waste money
on extra vitamins.

928
00:38:39,383 --> 00:38:41,374
Just one good multi is enough.

929
00:38:41,418 --> 00:38:42,612
You only need
to take Folic Acid

930
00:38:42,653 --> 00:38:43,585
if you`re trying
to get pregnant.

931
00:38:43,620 --> 00:38:45,554
Right, right...

932
00:38:45,589 --> 00:38:48,114
You just went somewhere again.
Did something happen?

933
00:38:48,359 --> 00:38:49,485
No, no.

934
00:38:49,526 --> 00:38:52,984
It`s just all this talk
about Fola-- Sadie,

935
00:38:53,030 --> 00:38:54,793
makes me want
to have a baby too.

936
00:38:54,832 --> 00:38:56,993
- You`re so competitive.
- Shut up.

937
00:38:58,635 --> 00:39:01,399
Well, when the time comes
you`ll go see my fertility guy.

938
00:39:01,438 --> 00:39:02,735
He`s the best in the city.

939
00:39:02,773 --> 00:39:04,764
Even though he didn`t do
a goddamn thing for me.

940
00:39:04,808 --> 00:39:06,400
I should get back to work.

941
00:39:06,443 --> 00:39:07,603
I love you.

942
00:39:07,644 --> 00:39:08,872
It`s all gonna work out.

943
00:39:09,613 --> 00:39:11,478
It better...

944
00:39:11,515 --> 00:39:12,880
Or I will start drinking again.

945
00:39:17,388 --> 00:39:18,753
Okay, give me that back.

946
00:39:18,789 --> 00:39:20,848
I`m pretty sure that is
the side I peed on.

947
00:39:20,891 --> 00:39:23,018
- Gross. And it`s a no, girl.
- Damn.

948
00:39:23,060 --> 00:39:24,755
More gay sex for you.

949
00:39:24,795 --> 00:39:27,127
Should I go to my sister`s
horrible Upper East Side doctor?

950
00:39:27,164 --> 00:39:28,062
No.

951
00:39:28,098 --> 00:39:30,896
But l, in fact, have an
amazing gynecologist.

952
00:39:30,934 --> 00:39:32,731
- What? Why?
- Well, no not like that.

953
00:39:32,770 --> 00:39:35,034
I mean he does inspect
my vagina regularly,

954
00:39:35,072 --> 00:39:36,767
but only in the bedroom.

955
00:39:37,641 --> 00:39:39,472
Skipping that for now...

956
00:39:39,510 --> 00:39:41,410
You know I hate
Western medicine.

957
00:39:41,445 --> 00:39:43,845
Jenn, you are not doing that.

958
00:39:43,881 --> 00:39:44,939
You`re going to my doctor

959
00:39:44,982 --> 00:39:46,643
who practices an
Eastern-Western mix.

960
00:39:46,683 --> 00:39:48,844
So does mine...
in bed.

961
00:39:50,654 --> 00:39:53,179
Valerie, what happened in there?

962
00:39:53,424 --> 00:39:54,857
You can`t just eat kale.

963
00:39:55,125 --> 00:39:57,184
Do you think
all these are necessary?

964
00:39:57,428 --> 00:39:59,191
We`ll tweak anything
that we need to,

965
00:39:59,430 --> 00:40:01,921
but call me if there are any
unpleasant side effects.

966
00:40:01,965 --> 00:40:02,932
Okay.

967
00:40:02,966 --> 00:40:04,058
How`s the sex?

968
00:40:04,101 --> 00:40:06,126
Oh, you know, it was
really awkward at first,

969
00:40:06,170 --> 00:40:07,899
but now that we got
the hang of it, it`s fine.

970
00:40:07,938 --> 00:40:09,462
Only fine?

971
00:40:09,506 --> 00:40:10,803
Oh, he`s my best friend.

972
00:40:10,841 --> 00:40:12,206
We`re only having sex
to get pregnant.

973
00:40:12,443 --> 00:40:14,502
As if men need an excuse
to have intercourse.

974
00:40:14,545 --> 00:40:15,671
Right.

975
00:40:15,712 --> 00:40:16,906
He`s gay though.

976
00:40:16,947 --> 00:40:18,107
Oh.

977
00:40:18,148 --> 00:40:19,672
Let me give you something.

978
00:40:20,984 --> 00:40:24,215
I make a loose leaf tea
with extra horny goat weed.

979
00:40:24,455 --> 00:40:25,683
What`s that?

980
00:40:25,722 --> 00:40:28,555
It`s a weed that goats eat
that makes them horny.

981
00:40:28,592 --> 00:40:30,082
It has the loveliest of tastes.

982
00:40:30,127 --> 00:40:32,061
And it helps
increase the sex drive.

983
00:40:32,095 --> 00:40:33,653
Getting pregnant can take time,

984
00:40:33,697 --> 00:40:36,598
and we don`t want you
to get tired of having sex.

985
00:40:36,633 --> 00:40:39,534
Is there anything to
increase my bust size?

986
00:40:39,570 --> 00:40:41,538
Yes...
Getting pregnant.

987
00:40:41,572 --> 00:40:43,506
Oh, I like you.
You`re funny.

988
00:40:43,540 --> 00:40:44,564
Yes.

989
00:40:45,976 --> 00:40:48,570
So you just stick to that list.

990
00:40:48,612 --> 00:40:50,637
But apart from that,
you just relax.

991
00:40:50,681 --> 00:40:53,775
Meditate, be peaceful.
Do yoga.

992
00:40:53,817 --> 00:40:55,478
That`s what I do.
I teach Bikram.

993
00:40:55,519 --> 00:40:58,010
Oh, I don`t like that.
It`s too hot.

994
00:40:58,055 --> 00:41:00,114
Well, do you think the heat
will be bad for the baby?

995
00:41:00,157 --> 00:41:02,557
No. Since Lilith,
women have been giving birth

996
00:41:02,593 --> 00:41:03,992
in the harshest of extremes.

997
00:41:04,027 --> 00:41:06,723
You`re gonna be fine.
I can see that.

998
00:41:06,763 --> 00:41:08,560
Who`s Lilith?

999
00:41:17,908 --> 00:41:19,671
Gross! Jenn, what is this?

1000
00:41:19,710 --> 00:41:22,008
Don`t drink that!
That`s my fertility tea.

1001
00:41:22,045 --> 00:41:24,275
Well, it`s nasty.
What the hell`s in it?

1002
00:41:24,515 --> 00:41:26,506
It`s horny goat weed
and some other herbs.

1003
00:41:26,550 --> 00:41:28,518
What is this? Rosemary`s Baby?

1004
00:41:28,552 --> 00:41:30,144
Are you sure
it`s okay to drink that?

1005
00:41:30,187 --> 00:41:31,848
My fertility guru
gave it to me.

1006
00:41:31,889 --> 00:41:33,151
She`s amazing.
I love her.

1007
00:41:33,190 --> 00:41:34,248
It`s so delicious.
I love this tea.

1008
00:41:34,291 --> 00:41:35,280
I`ve already had three cups.

1009
00:41:35,526 --> 00:41:36,925
There`s a male version.
You want me to get you some?

1010
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:38,928
That`s okay, I don`t
need any horny goat help.

1011
00:41:38,962 --> 00:41:40,827
- I gotta go to work.
- Okay, bye!

1012
00:41:41,832 --> 00:41:46,633
Go, go, lock it, lock it,
lock up that left knee,

1013
00:41:46,670 --> 00:41:48,228
and easily pump it out.

1014
00:41:48,272 --> 00:41:49,864
Yes! Can we do this?

1015
00:41:49,907 --> 00:41:51,966
Yeah! Loosen it up.
Make a circle.

1016
00:41:52,009 --> 00:41:53,237
Who`s got a circle in them?

1017
00:41:53,277 --> 00:41:55,040
You do! Make the circle.

1018
00:41:55,078 --> 00:41:56,875
Make it, okay, let it go.

1019
00:41:56,914 --> 00:41:59,644
Hoo! Shake it out.
Right into tree!

1020
00:41:59,683 --> 00:42:01,275
And to the right...

1021
00:42:01,318 --> 00:42:02,808
To the left...

1022
00:42:02,853 --> 00:42:04,878
and oh, get your asses
into it, huh?

1023
00:42:04,922 --> 00:42:06,913
Little bit of trunk in the--
Yes!

1024
00:42:06,957 --> 00:42:09,152
You know what?
Imagine you`re in a club, huh?

1025
00:42:09,192 --> 00:42:10,318
Feel the bass...

1026
00:42:10,561 --> 00:42:12,085
Feel the bass in that club?

1027
00:42:12,129 --> 00:42:13,790
Feel the bass
in that club?

1028
00:42:13,830 --> 00:42:15,320
That`s right.

1029
00:42:15,566 --> 00:42:17,727
Shake it out,
shake it out, let it go.

1030
00:42:17,768 --> 00:42:19,099
Let it...
That is class, ladies!

1031
00:42:19,136 --> 00:42:20,194
That is class!

1032
00:42:20,237 --> 00:42:21,670
Very nice job!

1033
00:42:21,705 --> 00:42:22,729
Well done!

1034
00:42:22,773 --> 00:42:23,797
Nice, ladies!

1035
00:42:25,108 --> 00:42:27,008
Class was really
different today.

1036
00:42:27,044 --> 00:42:28,636
I know, but it was
a good change.

1037
00:42:28,679 --> 00:42:30,806
Right? We should
change it up more often.

1038
00:42:30,847 --> 00:42:31,779
Wasn`t it great?

1039
00:42:31,815 --> 00:42:34,340
It was just...
really different.

1040
00:42:34,585 --> 00:42:36,052
- Yeah.
- I was into it.

1041
00:42:36,086 --> 00:42:37,348
I felt the bass.

1042
00:42:37,588 --> 00:42:40,853
You two are just so inspiring.

1043
00:42:40,891 --> 00:42:42,688
You notice
the differences in life.

1044
00:42:42,726 --> 00:42:44,216
Yeah, thanks.

1045
00:42:44,261 --> 00:42:46,195
I want you to leave
class remembering that.

1046
00:42:47,998 --> 00:42:50,228
I`m just gonna
swim on out of here.

1047
00:42:52,302 --> 00:42:54,031
Over to here.

1048
00:42:56,039 --> 00:42:57,370
It feels good in here.

1049
00:42:57,608 --> 00:42:58,973
It feels good in here.

1050
00:42:59,309 --> 00:43:01,140
Feels good in here...

1051
00:43:03,013 --> 00:43:04,378
Oh, my girl.

1052
00:43:04,615 --> 00:43:06,139
A dance break! Yes!

1053
00:43:15,659 --> 00:43:16,648
Go.

1054
00:43:23,066 --> 00:43:25,933
And then I started a non-profit
building schools in Africa.

1055
00:43:25,969 --> 00:43:27,129
Amazing.

1056
00:43:27,170 --> 00:43:29,161
Yeah, so I spend three months
of the year over there

1057
00:43:29,206 --> 00:43:30,867
and the rest
of the time l`m here,

1058
00:43:30,907 --> 00:43:32,875
hitting up my old co-workers
for guilt money.

1059
00:43:32,909 --> 00:43:34,137
[giggles]

1060
00:43:34,177 --> 00:43:37,408
That is so amay...
you are just amay-may.

1061
00:43:38,782 --> 00:43:40,113
What about you?
What do you do?

1062
00:43:40,150 --> 00:43:43,677
I teach Bikram
and a mix of other forms,

1063
00:43:43,720 --> 00:43:45,244
vinyasa flow and such.

1064
00:43:45,288 --> 00:43:48,780
Our studio`s thing is that we do
a strict Bikram unofficially,

1065
00:43:48,825 --> 00:43:50,156
and a regular hot.

1066
00:43:50,193 --> 00:43:51,319
It`s really rare.

1067
00:43:51,361 --> 00:43:53,921
Okay, that sounds nice.

1068
00:43:53,964 --> 00:43:55,932
And l`m proposing
some new classes

1069
00:43:55,966 --> 00:43:58,799
so this way I can stop having
to run errands for my boss.

1070
00:43:58,835 --> 00:43:59,893
Cool.

1071
00:43:59,936 --> 00:44:02,268
And...any other goals?

1072
00:44:02,305 --> 00:44:04,068
I really want to get pregnant.

1073
00:44:06,043 --> 00:44:08,068
Great, great.

1074
00:44:08,111 --> 00:44:09,942
So you teach yoga,
you run errands,

1075
00:44:09,980 --> 00:44:11,311
and you really want
to get pregnant?

1076
00:44:11,348 --> 00:44:13,407
Sure. Yeah.
Like, definitely this year.

1077
00:44:13,450 --> 00:44:15,179
But hopefully this month.

1078
00:44:15,218 --> 00:44:17,778
Great, wonderful.
I`m gonna go.

1079
00:44:17,821 --> 00:44:19,686
It was really nice meeting you.

1080
00:44:19,723 --> 00:44:21,054
I`m gonna pay
for the drinks, if that`s okay.

1081
00:44:21,091 --> 00:44:22,922
You`re leaving already?
You`re gonna go?

1082
00:44:22,959 --> 00:44:24,051
Yeah.

1083
00:44:24,961 --> 00:44:26,792
I`m looking for
an adult relationship.

1084
00:44:26,830 --> 00:44:28,127
You seem like
a really nice girl;

1085
00:44:28,165 --> 00:44:29,792
I just don`t have
the time to waste.

1086
00:44:29,833 --> 00:44:31,198
I totally get it.

1087
00:44:31,234 --> 00:44:33,259
The African children need you.

1088
00:44:34,104 --> 00:44:35,935
- Good luck.
- You too.

1089
00:44:39,710 --> 00:44:40,472
Whitey.

1090
00:44:41,912 --> 00:44:44,472
Hey, could I get...
change for this for these?

1091
00:44:45,282 --> 00:44:46,408
Thank you.

1092
00:44:46,450 --> 00:44:49,351
Is this for
the Manhattan or the Martini?

1093
00:44:49,386 --> 00:44:50,375
[cell phone rings]

1094
00:44:50,420 --> 00:44:53,253
I`m sorry, do you
mind if I take this?

1095
00:44:53,290 --> 00:44:54,848
Right now?

1096
00:44:54,891 --> 00:44:56,381
Yeah, real quickly.

1097
00:44:56,993 --> 00:44:57,925
Hello.

1098
00:44:57,961 --> 00:44:59,326
Hi, Adam, it`s Lilith.

1099
00:44:59,362 --> 00:45:00,829
Lilith?

1100
00:45:00,864 --> 00:45:02,729
She was Eve, before Eve.

1101
00:45:02,766 --> 00:45:04,927
I see.

1102
00:45:04,968 --> 00:45:07,334
Well, Lilith, l`m a little
busy right now.

1103
00:45:07,370 --> 00:45:09,167
Are you on a date
with someone else?

1104
00:45:09,206 --> 00:45:10,764
Say my name.
Say my name.

1105
00:45:10,807 --> 00:45:11,774
Okay.

1106
00:45:11,808 --> 00:45:13,105
How about we talk tomorrow.

1107
00:45:13,143 --> 00:45:15,873
Try not to get all
weird on me, all right?

1108
00:45:15,912 --> 00:45:17,846
Oh, l`m already there.

1109
00:45:19,015 --> 00:45:20,812
- l`m sorry about that.
- Who was that?

1110
00:45:24,888 --> 00:45:27,857
Oh, girl, you look so sad.

1111
00:45:30,894 --> 00:45:32,794
- This is nice.
- Yeah.

1112
00:45:35,766 --> 00:45:37,131
You know what would be nicer?

1113
00:45:37,167 --> 00:45:38,134
What?

1114
00:45:38,168 --> 00:45:39,430
Um...

1115
00:45:39,469 --> 00:45:41,494
If we took off our shirts.

1116
00:45:42,806 --> 00:45:43,795
Okay.

1117
00:45:48,111 --> 00:45:49,874
- Oh, glasses.
- Oh, sorry, sorry.

1118
00:45:49,913 --> 00:45:50,902
Oh, there we go.

1119
00:46:04,327 --> 00:46:05,851
[keys clanging]

1120
00:46:07,197 --> 00:46:08,562
What was that?

1121
00:46:08,799 --> 00:46:12,530
I`m sorry, that`s...
That`s my friend Jenn.

1122
00:46:14,471 --> 00:46:16,029
Hey, I dropped my keys.

1123
00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:19,305
I thought you were on a date.

1124
00:46:19,342 --> 00:46:22,470
Yeah...
No, it didn`t go so good.

1125
00:46:22,512 --> 00:46:24,070
I`m sorry.

1126
00:46:24,114 --> 00:46:26,241
Could you go away
for a while

1127
00:46:26,283 --> 00:46:27,545
and then come back?

1128
00:46:27,584 --> 00:46:29,176
I need some more time.

1129
00:46:29,219 --> 00:46:32,052
Can I go downstairs in the room
with the comic books?

1130
00:46:32,088 --> 00:46:33,521
No.

1131
00:46:33,557 --> 00:46:35,354
Who is it tonight? Lorenzo?

1132
00:46:35,392 --> 00:46:37,553
It`s that guy from the store.

1133
00:46:37,594 --> 00:46:40,461
So maybe you could go
back to your place for a bit,

1134
00:46:40,497 --> 00:46:42,055
and l`ll text you.

1135
00:46:42,098 --> 00:46:44,328
Sure. Yeah, sure.

1136
00:46:44,367 --> 00:46:45,994
Thank you so much.

1137
00:46:46,036 --> 00:46:49,062
Oh, hey, don`t you do
anything that I wouldn`t do.

1138
00:46:49,105 --> 00:46:50,231
Okay...

1139
00:46:51,374 --> 00:46:54,002
There are actually a lot
of things that I would do,

1140
00:46:54,044 --> 00:46:57,605
that you wouldn`t do,
that I just might do.

1141
00:47:01,117 --> 00:47:02,846
I did booty sex once!

1142
00:47:15,532 --> 00:47:16,499
Oh...

1143
00:47:16,533 --> 00:47:18,296
What are you
doing here so late?

1144
00:47:18,335 --> 00:47:20,098
I was priming.

1145
00:47:20,136 --> 00:47:22,229
I don`t know what that means.

1146
00:47:22,272 --> 00:47:23,637
Don`t worry about it.

1147
00:47:25,508 --> 00:47:27,408
I do my own stuff
during the day.

1148
00:47:27,444 --> 00:47:29,878
I need light for my work.

1149
00:47:29,913 --> 00:47:31,380
I save this for the night.

1150
00:47:31,414 --> 00:47:32,608
It calms me.

1151
00:47:32,649 --> 00:47:36,278
My work is really...violent.

1152
00:47:36,319 --> 00:47:38,116
Oh, l`d like to see it sometime.

1153
00:47:38,154 --> 00:47:40,145
I don`t know
if you can handle it.

1154
00:47:43,460 --> 00:47:44,950
[clears throat]

1155
00:47:46,129 --> 00:47:47,255
What`s wrong?

1156
00:47:48,164 --> 00:47:50,029
Your color`s...off.

1157
00:47:50,066 --> 00:47:52,432
Oh, I just had this
really terrible date

1158
00:47:52,469 --> 00:47:54,937
with this judgmental
do-gooder douche bag.

1159
00:47:54,971 --> 00:47:57,371
- Oh man, I hate that type.
- Yeah.

1160
00:47:57,407 --> 00:47:58,965
And the guy that
l`m having sex with,

1161
00:47:59,009 --> 00:48:00,408
and the guy I like
are both busy.

1162
00:48:00,443 --> 00:48:02,138
So, you know...

1163
00:48:02,178 --> 00:48:04,942
You`re polyamorous...
Right on.

1164
00:48:04,981 --> 00:48:06,346
Yeah.

1165
00:48:06,383 --> 00:48:08,476
And l`m taking these herbs
that are making me feel

1166
00:48:08,518 --> 00:48:09,985
Iike all sorts of weird.

1167
00:48:10,020 --> 00:48:11,078
What kind of weird?

1168
00:48:11,121 --> 00:48:15,080
Like crazy, horny weird.

1169
00:48:15,125 --> 00:48:17,923
Oh... You wanna have sex?

1170
00:48:17,961 --> 00:48:19,428
I`m basically done here.

1171
00:48:19,462 --> 00:48:21,930
- l`ve got half an hour to kill.
- Let`s kill it.

1172
00:48:25,001 --> 00:48:27,435
[moaning]

1173
00:48:35,345 --> 00:48:37,176
No, wait, wait, wait.
Do you have a condom?

1174
00:48:37,213 --> 00:48:38,703
Uh...

1175
00:48:38,949 --> 00:48:40,177
I don`t think so.

1176
00:48:40,216 --> 00:48:41,945
I wasn`t really
expecting this tonight.

1177
00:48:41,985 --> 00:48:43,350
Do you have any?

1178
00:48:43,386 --> 00:48:45,183
Yeah. In the bathroom
there`s a 1 2-pack

1179
00:48:45,221 --> 00:48:46,654
from when I first moved in.

1180
00:48:46,690 --> 00:48:49,989
Okay... I`ll bring the box.

1181
00:48:55,231 --> 00:48:56,289
Hurry up.

1182
00:48:59,469 --> 00:49:01,403
[gasping, moaning]

1183
00:49:23,293 --> 00:49:24,760
Don`t worry.
It`s water-based.

1184
00:49:24,995 --> 00:49:26,622
- What?
- Water-based.

1185
00:49:26,663 --> 00:49:29,097
- The lube?
- No, the paint.

1186
00:49:29,132 --> 00:49:32,192
- The what?
- The wall, it`s still wet.

1187
00:49:32,235 --> 00:49:34,601
- l`m so wet.
- Hell, yeah.

1188
00:49:34,637 --> 00:49:36,605
- Don`t stop.
- Hell, no!

1189
00:49:36,639 --> 00:49:38,072
Don`t you dare stop!

1190
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:47,081
Okay, okay, okay, okay...

1191
00:49:47,117 --> 00:49:49,244
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah!

1192
00:49:50,186 --> 00:49:51,585
Whoa.

1193
00:49:51,621 --> 00:49:52,610
Yeah.

1194
00:49:53,723 --> 00:49:55,782
That was really athletic.

1195
00:49:56,026 --> 00:49:57,186
Yeah.

1196
00:49:59,329 --> 00:50:01,524
You sure you don`t
want to do it tonight?

1197
00:50:01,564 --> 00:50:03,532
Yeah, let`s just
do it in the morning.

1198
00:50:03,566 --> 00:50:04,692
Okay.

1199
00:50:10,340 --> 00:50:13,241
Maybe we should try
that turkey baster thing.

1200
00:50:14,377 --> 00:50:16,072
Really?

1201
00:50:16,112 --> 00:50:18,239
You sound disappointed.

1202
00:50:18,281 --> 00:50:22,479
No...
I mean, obviously, no.

1203
00:50:22,519 --> 00:50:24,214
I am gay.

1204
00:50:25,188 --> 00:50:26,621
Is something wrong?

1205
00:50:26,656 --> 00:50:28,214
No, no.

1206
00:50:28,258 --> 00:50:30,419
I`ve just been working a lot.
I`m really tired.

1207
00:50:32,429 --> 00:50:34,556
You`re stretched out
from all that yoga?

1208
00:50:36,599 --> 00:50:38,226
[phone ringing]

1209
00:50:38,735 --> 00:50:39,827
Hello.

1210
00:50:40,070 --> 00:50:41,264
Nelly?

1211
00:50:41,304 --> 00:50:42,566
This is she.

1212
00:50:42,605 --> 00:50:43,731
Hey...

1213
00:50:43,773 --> 00:50:47,265
Do you have any of those
needle-less syringe things

1214
00:50:47,310 --> 00:50:49,175
we used to give
your cat meds with?

1215
00:50:49,212 --> 00:50:51,203
Yeah, I have a whole box
of them. Why?

1216
00:50:51,247 --> 00:50:52,441
Jenn and I need some.

1217
00:50:52,482 --> 00:50:54,712
We`ve decided to move past sex.

1218
00:50:54,751 --> 00:50:57,811
Oh, good, because let me say,
that was really ridiculous.

1219
00:50:57,854 --> 00:50:59,412
Could you bring some over?

1220
00:50:59,456 --> 00:51:01,185
Now?

1221
00:51:01,224 --> 00:51:02,418
Why are you whispering?

1222
00:51:02,459 --> 00:51:04,393
Because l`m in
a magical land called Astoria,

1223
00:51:04,427 --> 00:51:06,452
where no one need
speak above a whisper.

1224
00:51:08,765 --> 00:51:10,130
I gotta go.

1225
00:51:11,167 --> 00:51:12,225
Gimme some sugar.

1226
00:51:21,377 --> 00:51:23,345
You woke me up
and made me come here

1227
00:51:23,379 --> 00:51:25,347
and went back to sleep?
Get up.

1228
00:51:25,381 --> 00:51:26,541
Hey.

1229
00:51:26,583 --> 00:51:30,280
I`m so glad that my cat`s death
could help you procreate.

1230
00:51:30,320 --> 00:51:31,787
Is that what I think it is?

1231
00:51:31,821 --> 00:51:33,789
Yes, it`s
Miss Lulu Kitty`s ashes.

1232
00:51:33,823 --> 00:51:36,155
She needed to be here
if she`s gonna help create life.

1233
00:51:36,192 --> 00:51:38,786
Oh, okay.
Well, hi, Miss Lulu Kitty.

1234
00:51:38,828 --> 00:51:40,887
Thank you for the syringes.

1235
00:51:43,566 --> 00:51:46,626
If it`s a girl you should name
her Lucretia as an homage.

1236
00:51:46,669 --> 00:51:47,863
And what if it`s a boy?

1237
00:51:47,904 --> 00:51:50,771
I don`t know.
Ash? Tin?

1238
00:51:50,807 --> 00:51:52,502
Ashton.

1239
00:51:52,542 --> 00:51:54,442
- l`m gonna get to it.
- Go for it.

1240
00:51:54,477 --> 00:51:56,138
- Do you want to help?
- Nope, not into you.

1241
00:51:56,179 --> 00:51:58,147
- Not even a little bit?
- Nope, and not ever.

1242
00:51:58,181 --> 00:51:59,478
That`s because you loved Tom.

1243
00:51:59,516 --> 00:52:00,346
Partially...

1244
00:52:00,383 --> 00:52:01,782
And you hated me
when I started dating him.

1245
00:52:01,818 --> 00:52:02,785
Definitely.

1246
00:52:02,819 --> 00:52:04,150
But you`re still my friend.

1247
00:52:04,187 --> 00:52:06,348
We work on the same block
and you`re a good lunch date.

1248
00:52:06,389 --> 00:52:07,720
Besides, I like that
I have one friend

1249
00:52:07,757 --> 00:52:09,452
that l`m not
secretly in love with.

1250
00:52:09,492 --> 00:52:11,255
That`s refreshing
and rare for us gays.

1251
00:52:11,294 --> 00:52:13,194
That`s true.
Hug me?

1252
00:52:13,229 --> 00:52:14,890
No, not this early.
Gross.

1253
00:52:14,931 --> 00:52:16,364
I`m gonna go jerk off.

1254
00:52:16,399 --> 00:52:19,630
Can you hurry up, please?
I need to go to brunch.

1255
00:52:22,338 --> 00:52:23,805
[whispers]
I love you, Miss Lulu.

1256
00:52:24,908 --> 00:52:27,308
Oh, hey, Nelson.
Where`s Matt?

1257
00:52:27,343 --> 00:52:28,674
In the bathroom jerking off

1258
00:52:28,711 --> 00:52:30,611
into my dead cat`s
oral medicine dispenser

1259
00:52:30,647 --> 00:52:33,275
so that he can inject you
with his baby juice.

1260
00:52:33,316 --> 00:52:34,943
Before my first cup of coffee?

1261
00:52:35,185 --> 00:52:36,948
Well, you better have one,
because once he ejaculates,

1262
00:52:37,187 --> 00:52:39,280
you really should insert it
within the first 20 minutes.

1263
00:52:39,322 --> 00:52:40,289
Okay.

1264
00:52:40,323 --> 00:52:42,814
It`s 1 0: 1 5. Do you know
where your cervix is?

1265
00:52:42,859 --> 00:52:44,690
You know, not really.

1266
00:52:44,727 --> 00:52:47,423
Stick your index finger
in your vagina.

1267
00:52:47,463 --> 00:52:48,760
- Not here.
- Okay.

1268
00:52:48,798 --> 00:52:51,596
And you want to feel along
the inside of your sugar walls,

1269
00:52:51,634 --> 00:52:53,192
towards the front.
this way.

1270
00:52:53,236 --> 00:52:54,601
How do you know
so much about this?

1271
00:52:54,637 --> 00:52:55,797
I have two children.

1272
00:52:55,838 --> 00:52:57,430
- Really?
- Yes.

1273
00:52:57,473 --> 00:52:59,498
One with each half
of a lesbian couple.

1274
00:52:59,542 --> 00:53:01,976
I gave up my parental rights,
but I see them sometimes.

1275
00:53:02,212 --> 00:53:04,612
Not as often as l`d like,
`cause they live in Park Slope.

1276
00:53:04,881 --> 00:53:07,714
- l`m kind of their aunt.
- That is so sweet.

1277
00:53:07,750 --> 00:53:10,583
Yeah, anyway, your cervix is
near the top of your vagina.

1278
00:53:10,620 --> 00:53:11,450
It`s kind of squishy, like--

1279
00:53:11,487 --> 00:53:12,886
You need
to stay and help us.

1280
00:53:12,922 --> 00:53:14,355
Of course I do.

1281
00:53:14,757 --> 00:53:17,225
Okay, let`s lift
this pillow a little bit.

1282
00:53:17,260 --> 00:53:18,488
Okay.

1283
00:53:18,528 --> 00:53:19,688
How`s the pillow?

1284
00:53:19,729 --> 00:53:20,753
Oh, it`s okay.

1285
00:53:20,797 --> 00:53:22,321
- Are you ready?
- Yeah.

1286
00:53:22,365 --> 00:53:23,457
Are you ready?

1287
00:53:25,501 --> 00:53:26,433
[blows kiss]

1288
00:53:26,469 --> 00:53:27,595
Sperm.

1289
00:53:28,638 --> 00:53:31,471
I have to shoot this in slowly,
so it`ll take a hot minute.

1290
00:53:33,509 --> 00:53:34,601
Nice yard work.

1291
00:53:34,644 --> 00:53:36,009
Oh, thank you, l...

1292
00:53:39,449 --> 00:53:41,314
There... All done.

1293
00:53:41,351 --> 00:53:43,012
Now, don`t move
for a half an hour.

1294
00:53:43,253 --> 00:53:44,413
Are you using a predictor kit?

1295
00:53:44,454 --> 00:53:47,685
I`m using an online
lunar cycle ovulation calendar.

1296
00:53:47,724 --> 00:53:48,691
That`ll do.

1297
00:53:48,725 --> 00:53:50,989
Now do this at least once
a day for four more days,

1298
00:53:51,027 --> 00:53:52,961
and it`ll probably work.
It worked both times for me.

1299
00:53:52,996 --> 00:53:55,260
Thank you...so much.

1300
00:53:55,298 --> 00:53:57,858
- Just make me Goddess-mother.
- No, really. Thank you.

1301
00:53:57,900 --> 00:54:00,334
You - take me
and Miss Lulu to brunch.

1302
00:54:00,370 --> 00:54:02,031
You - stay there
for 30 minutes.

1303
00:54:03,840 --> 00:54:04,898
Okay.

1304
00:54:07,477 --> 00:54:10,037
Can you bring me a...
a crepe?

1305
00:54:48,618 --> 00:54:49,607
[belch]

1306
00:54:49,652 --> 00:54:51,085
Yeah...

1307
00:54:51,321 --> 00:54:52,413
What?

1308
00:54:52,455 --> 00:54:53,422
Oops.

1309
00:54:53,456 --> 00:54:54,514
Don`t worry about it.

1310
00:55:00,997 --> 00:55:02,555
It`s time.

1311
00:55:02,598 --> 00:55:03,963
Oh, no!

1312
00:55:04,600 --> 00:55:06,090
I`m sad you`re leaving.

1313
00:55:07,470 --> 00:55:09,665
I haven`t spent this much
time with you since college.

1314
00:55:09,706 --> 00:55:10,695
It`s been fun.

1315
00:55:10,740 --> 00:55:12,833
That`s why l`m leaving
right now, while it`s still fun.

1316
00:55:12,875 --> 00:55:14,502
I don`t want to
over-stay my welcome.

1317
00:55:14,544 --> 00:55:15,533
You could never.

1318
00:55:15,578 --> 00:55:16,772
Yes I could, trust me.

1319
00:55:16,813 --> 00:55:18,906
I have a good feeling
about this month.

1320
00:55:18,948 --> 00:55:19,937
Me too.

1321
00:55:23,920 --> 00:55:25,387
[door squeaks open]

1322
00:55:32,128 --> 00:55:34,528
No one signed up
for my prenatal class.

1323
00:55:36,899 --> 00:55:39,060
Pregnant women
are not into hot yoga.

1324
00:55:41,371 --> 00:55:43,134
Can I ask you something crazy?

1325
00:55:43,373 --> 00:55:44,635
Something crazy?

1326
00:55:44,674 --> 00:55:46,005
As opposed to
everything else you say?

1327
00:55:46,042 --> 00:55:49,876
What about instead
of hot yoga - warm yoga?

1328
00:55:49,912 --> 00:55:52,437
- Lukewarm?
- No. Warm-Warm.

1329
00:55:52,482 --> 00:55:54,746
Like everyone who hates
hot yoga could do it.

1330
00:55:54,784 --> 00:55:55,944
Pregnant women could do it.

1331
00:55:55,985 --> 00:55:57,748
and they`d still get
some of the benefits.

1332
00:55:57,787 --> 00:55:59,152
Do you think it`s any good?

1333
00:55:59,389 --> 00:56:01,380
No...
It sounds ludicrous.

1334
00:56:01,424 --> 00:56:02,891
But it`s also so stupid,

1335
00:56:02,925 --> 00:56:04,483
maybe smart people
would love it.

1336
00:56:04,527 --> 00:56:06,154
Yeah...
I`m gonna take it to Linda.

1337
00:56:06,396 --> 00:56:08,091
It`s crazy,
but it`s also amazing.

1338
00:56:08,131 --> 00:56:09,723
It`s craymazing.

1339
00:56:09,766 --> 00:56:11,165
I hope so.

1340
00:56:11,401 --> 00:56:12,925
Something`s different about you.

1341
00:56:12,969 --> 00:56:14,869
Your energy`s changed.

1342
00:56:14,904 --> 00:56:16,769
I don`t want to talk about it.

1343
00:56:16,806 --> 00:56:18,865
Oh, yes, you do.
What is it?

1344
00:56:18,908 --> 00:56:20,808
All the gay sex
confusing your feelings?

1345
00:56:20,843 --> 00:56:23,175
No. We stopped having sex.

1346
00:56:23,413 --> 00:56:25,643
We`re doing the
turkey baster method,

1347
00:56:25,681 --> 00:56:27,410
but with a cat syringe.

1348
00:56:27,917 --> 00:56:29,509
Did you finally realize

1349
00:56:29,552 --> 00:56:32,043
how totally bizarre
that whole scenario was?

1350
00:56:32,088 --> 00:56:33,487
No, it`s not that.

1351
00:56:33,523 --> 00:56:35,115
I just kind of had sex
with someone else,

1352
00:56:35,158 --> 00:56:37,683
and I just felt really weird
about having it with Matt.

1353
00:56:37,727 --> 00:56:39,661
Who was it?
One of these dates?

1354
00:56:39,695 --> 00:56:41,492
No. It`s someone else.

1355
00:56:41,964 --> 00:56:44,728
No way!
Did you have sex with Louis?!

1356
00:56:44,767 --> 00:56:45,995
Oh, my God!
How was it?

1357
00:56:46,035 --> 00:56:47,969
Tell me everything
so I can imagine it was me.

1358
00:56:48,004 --> 00:56:49,665
You know it was
really out of nowhere.

1359
00:56:49,705 --> 00:56:52,731
It was, like,
really intense and...

1360
00:56:52,775 --> 00:56:54,675
Craymazing, obviously.

1361
00:56:54,710 --> 00:56:56,541
Yeah, it was also that.

1362
00:56:56,579 --> 00:56:59,173
But it also
just felt really wrong.

1363
00:56:59,215 --> 00:57:00,477
Well, sure, Jenn.

1364
00:57:00,516 --> 00:57:02,108
That`s because
he has a girlfriend.

1365
00:57:02,785 --> 00:57:04,776
What?
He did not tell me that.

1366
00:57:04,821 --> 00:57:07,187
- Did you ask?
- No, but he didn`t offer.

1367
00:57:07,223 --> 00:57:09,123
Well, he was busy
offering something else.

1368
00:57:09,158 --> 00:57:11,456
Oh, no, now I feel terrible.

1369
00:57:11,494 --> 00:57:12,552
You should.

1370
00:57:14,096 --> 00:57:15,620
Home-wrecker.

1371
00:57:16,132 --> 00:57:17,827
We sold out of the
one where he dies,

1372
00:57:17,867 --> 00:57:20,062
but we have plenty of the one
where he comes back to life.

1373
00:57:21,904 --> 00:57:23,633
No, no...
He`s already alive again.

1374
00:57:24,607 --> 00:57:27,007
`Cause they`re making
a movie about him so...

1375
00:57:27,643 --> 00:57:28,803
Hey, Parker!

1376
00:57:29,512 --> 00:57:30,638
Could you
hold on a second?

1377
00:57:30,680 --> 00:57:31,840
Hi. How`s it going?

1378
00:57:32,882 --> 00:57:34,713
He can`t stop
talking about comics.

1379
00:57:34,750 --> 00:57:35,739
He is hooked.

1380
00:57:35,785 --> 00:57:36,581
That`s so cute.

1381
00:57:36,619 --> 00:57:37,517
Hi.

1382
00:57:38,621 --> 00:57:40,248
Can I help you with
anything else today?

1383
00:57:42,859 --> 00:57:43,985
Okay. Bye.

1384
00:57:45,228 --> 00:57:46,195
Hi.

1385
00:57:47,063 --> 00:57:48,030
Hi.

1386
00:57:48,898 --> 00:57:50,763
So, I know that you
said you`re busy,

1387
00:57:50,800 --> 00:57:53,598
but is there any night
this week that you

1388
00:57:53,636 --> 00:57:55,797
might want to go out
for dinner or something?

1389
00:57:55,838 --> 00:57:59,137
I have Parker all week
so I can`t get away.

1390
00:57:59,175 --> 00:58:00,506
I wish I could.

1391
00:58:00,543 --> 00:58:02,602
But, you know,
he`s gotta come first.

1392
00:58:02,645 --> 00:58:03,942
I totally understand.

1393
00:58:05,615 --> 00:58:08,049
This has gotta be super casual.

1394
00:58:08,084 --> 00:58:09,813
I gotta take things slow.

1395
00:58:09,852 --> 00:58:12,844
Yeah, slow... Totally.

1396
00:58:13,723 --> 00:58:15,190
Are you sure
you`re okay with that?

1397
00:58:15,224 --> 00:58:17,124
Yeah, of course l`m okay.

1398
00:58:17,994 --> 00:58:20,861
Slow...
I can do that.

1399
00:58:21,998 --> 00:58:24,193
Then he`s like,
``Can you handle casual? ``

1400
00:58:24,233 --> 00:58:26,758
And he has a kid
with his ex-wife.

1401
00:58:26,802 --> 00:58:28,736
Maybe he does
just wanna take it slow,

1402
00:58:28,771 --> 00:58:29,760
but I just...

1403
00:58:29,805 --> 00:58:31,636
I think l`m ready for
something more right now--

1404
00:58:31,674 --> 00:58:32,641
Whoa, whoa.

1405
00:58:32,675 --> 00:58:34,768
Can we just take
a breath here for a moment?

1406
00:58:34,810 --> 00:58:36,903
- l`m trying.
- Hang up. I`m here now.

1407
00:58:36,946 --> 00:58:37,913
Oh, right.

1408
00:58:37,947 --> 00:58:40,939
Now, first let`s take a moment
to celebrate the fact

1409
00:58:40,983 --> 00:58:43,042
that you`re freaking
out about someone,

1410
00:58:43,085 --> 00:58:44,313
and it`s not Tom.

1411
00:58:45,688 --> 00:58:46,780
You`re right.

1412
00:58:46,822 --> 00:58:48,187
And it`s great to hear that.

1413
00:58:48,224 --> 00:58:50,658
But this doesn`t
sound all that different.

1414
00:58:50,693 --> 00:58:52,126
But I really like this guy.

1415
00:58:52,161 --> 00:58:54,152
You`ve been on what -
like, two dates with him?

1416
00:58:54,196 --> 00:58:55,891
And now he says he
wants to keep it casual?

1417
00:58:55,932 --> 00:58:58,799
So you either accept that,
or you stop dating him.

1418
00:58:58,834 --> 00:58:59,892
There`s no in between.

1419
00:58:59,936 --> 00:59:01,801
I know, I know.

1420
00:59:01,837 --> 00:59:03,327
Can you do casual?

1421
00:59:03,573 --> 00:59:04,870
Absolutely not.

1422
00:59:04,907 --> 00:59:07,774
You can`t engage in this.
It`s just repeating a cycle.

1423
00:59:07,810 --> 00:59:11,268
They say when it`s hysterical,
it`s historical.

1424
00:59:11,314 --> 00:59:12,906
What does that even mean?

1425
00:59:12,949 --> 00:59:15,611
It means that if you`re getting
crazy over this guy so soon,

1426
00:59:15,651 --> 00:59:17,346
it has nothing to do with him,

1427
00:59:17,587 --> 00:59:18,986
and more to do
with how you feel

1428
00:59:19,021 --> 00:59:21,080
when you think people
are abandoning you.

1429
00:59:21,991 --> 00:59:24,084
Wow.
Where`d you get that from?

1430
00:59:24,126 --> 00:59:25,150
Jamie and I read

1431
00:59:25,194 --> 00:59:27,287
``Codependent No More``
together at work sometimes.

1432
00:59:27,330 --> 00:59:30,959
You`re very...
full of wisdom today.

1433
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:32,695
I know.
Let`s just go with it.

1434
00:59:32,735 --> 00:59:35,067
So what`s going on with
your Super Gayby book?

1435
00:59:36,138 --> 00:59:38,834
Well, the only place that`s
really good for it is Kapow,

1436
00:59:38,874 --> 00:59:41,707
and Tom works there now
so I can`t bring it to him.

1437
00:59:41,744 --> 00:59:42,711
Matt, come on!

1438
00:59:42,745 --> 00:59:44,110
You have to stop
letting him get in your way.

1439
00:59:44,146 --> 00:59:45,238
I know.

1440
00:59:46,983 --> 00:59:48,712
I have to tell you something.

1441
00:59:48,751 --> 00:59:50,719
- Bad or good?
- One of each.

1442
00:59:50,753 --> 00:59:51,811
Can you give me
the good, please?

1443
00:59:51,854 --> 00:59:53,788
I don`t think I can handle
the bad right now.

1444
00:59:53,823 --> 00:59:56,018
At work today I was
adjusting a posture,

1445
00:59:56,058 --> 00:59:57,992
and a woman
elbowed me in the breast.

1446
00:59:58,027 --> 01:00:00,860
And out of nowhere
I screamed, ``Ow, my tit!``

1447
01:00:00,896 --> 01:00:05,731
- Your breasts aren`t sensitive.
- They aren`t...ever.

1448
01:00:05,768 --> 01:00:07,030
- Oh...
- Yeah.

1449
01:00:08,270 --> 01:00:09,862
- Really?
- Really.

1450
01:00:09,905 --> 01:00:12,373
I went to Dr. Ushma and she
confirmed and everything.

1451
01:00:12,408 --> 01:00:14,273
- We`re pregnant?!
- We`re pregnant!

1452
01:00:14,310 --> 01:00:16,778
Oh, my God!
That`s amazing!

1453
01:00:16,812 --> 01:00:18,040
[giggling]

1454
01:00:19,181 --> 01:00:22,412
- Wow! I am so excited!
- Yeah.

1455
01:00:22,652 --> 01:00:23,983
Wait, what was the bad thing?

1456
01:00:24,020 --> 01:00:25,112
I don`t remember.

1457
01:00:25,154 --> 01:00:26,416
It mustn`t have
been that important.

1458
01:00:26,656 --> 01:00:27,315
Are you happy?

1459
01:00:27,356 --> 01:00:29,085
- So much so, yeah.
- Me too.

1460
01:00:31,761 --> 01:00:32,853
Hello, everyone.

1461
01:00:32,895 --> 01:00:34,658
I`m teaching for Jamie tonight.

1462
01:00:34,697 --> 01:00:35,755
Hey, Valerie.

1463
01:00:37,800 --> 01:00:40,234
Just find your space, okay?

1464
01:00:40,269 --> 01:00:42,032
Your space.

1465
01:00:42,071 --> 01:00:43,436
Just take a minute.

1466
01:00:44,407 --> 01:00:47,171
Just be by yourself
in that space.

1467
01:00:48,778 --> 01:00:50,769
Yeah, hi.
What are you doing here?

1468
01:00:51,814 --> 01:00:53,441
I take this class every week.

1469
01:00:54,150 --> 01:00:56,948
Oh, yeah, right.

1470
01:00:58,087 --> 01:00:59,111
Do you mind?

1471
01:00:59,155 --> 01:01:02,124
No, no, no...

1472
01:01:02,158 --> 01:01:03,455
No.

1473
01:01:03,693 --> 01:01:06,389
All right, take a comfortable
seated position, long spine.

1474
01:01:08,230 --> 01:01:09,720
All right...

1475
01:01:09,765 --> 01:01:12,131
Let`s take a deep
inhale through the nose...

1476
01:01:14,336 --> 01:01:16,361
Just this first time let`s take
it out through the mouth.

1477
01:01:19,241 --> 01:01:21,732
Let go of the stresses
of the day.

1478
01:01:21,777 --> 01:01:23,244
Okay?

1479
01:01:24,480 --> 01:01:28,473
Let go of your job...
your pets...

1480
01:01:31,120 --> 01:01:32,781
Okay?

1481
01:01:32,822 --> 01:01:35,723
Let go of that confrontation
on the subway, let that go.

1482
01:01:37,860 --> 01:01:39,327
Your boyfriends.

1483
01:01:41,831 --> 01:01:43,890
Okay? The girlfriends...

1484
01:01:45,267 --> 01:01:46,359
The girlfriends that you have

1485
01:01:46,402 --> 01:01:48,063
that you don`t tell
other girls you have.

1486
01:01:48,104 --> 01:01:49,264
Let`s just let that go.

1487
01:01:52,341 --> 01:01:54,935
Let us think
about responsibility.

1488
01:01:54,977 --> 01:01:56,774
Okay? That word.

1489
01:01:58,147 --> 01:01:59,944
About being an adult.

1490
01:02:01,016 --> 01:02:02,449
Okay?

1491
01:02:02,485 --> 01:02:08,754
All those really good qualities,
even if you don`t have them...

1492
01:02:08,791 --> 01:02:10,418
Let`s breathe that in.

1493
01:02:12,027 --> 01:02:15,258
And let`s exhale
right on out to warrior two.

1494
01:02:15,297 --> 01:02:17,492
Let`s hold warrior two
for a minute.

1495
01:02:17,533 --> 01:02:19,023
Breathing.

1496
01:02:19,068 --> 01:02:20,399
Well done.

1497
01:02:20,436 --> 01:02:22,097
Breathing.

1498
01:02:22,138 --> 01:02:23,400
Nice.

1499
01:02:23,439 --> 01:02:24,428
A little deeper.

1500
01:02:24,473 --> 01:02:27,465
Does it hurt?
It should probably not hurt.

1501
01:02:27,510 --> 01:02:29,978
Keep your head up to the sky.

1502
01:02:30,012 --> 01:02:33,004
Excellent, excellent, beautiful.

1503
01:02:33,048 --> 01:02:34,879
Oh, this is nice.

1504
01:02:34,917 --> 01:02:36,407
This is very balanced.

1505
01:02:36,452 --> 01:02:38,147
Take care, be well.

1506
01:02:40,956 --> 01:02:42,423
Dude...

1507
01:02:42,458 --> 01:02:44,323
Why are you so mad at me?

1508
01:02:44,360 --> 01:02:45,850
You have a girlfriend?

1509
01:02:45,895 --> 01:02:47,362
We broke up.

1510
01:02:47,396 --> 01:02:50,297
I mean, we were
broken up that week.

1511
01:02:50,332 --> 01:02:52,323
We break up a lot.

1512
01:02:52,368 --> 01:02:55,496
I would never have been
with you if we were together.

1513
01:02:55,538 --> 01:02:56,835
I`m not like that.

1514
01:02:56,872 --> 01:02:58,396
- Really?
- Really.

1515
01:02:58,440 --> 01:03:01,034
We had a connection.

1516
01:03:01,076 --> 01:03:03,169
And at the time
I was free to act on it.

1517
01:03:05,181 --> 01:03:06,239
Okay.

1518
01:03:06,582 --> 01:03:11,383
You know it was really...
it was fun.

1519
01:03:11,420 --> 01:03:13,320
Yeah, it was.

1520
01:03:13,355 --> 01:03:15,323
And l`m grateful to you.

1521
01:03:15,357 --> 01:03:16,881
You helped me.

1522
01:03:16,926 --> 01:03:18,120
How?

1523
01:03:18,160 --> 01:03:20,287
After I had sex with you,

1524
01:03:20,329 --> 01:03:22,297
I realized I wanted
my girlfriend back.

1525
01:03:23,165 --> 01:03:25,326
Are you always
this much of a jerk?

1526
01:03:25,367 --> 01:03:27,267
No, listen, just...

1527
01:03:27,303 --> 01:03:28,930
Who knows what
could have happened?

1528
01:03:28,971 --> 01:03:30,871
You could have gotten pregnant.

1529
01:03:30,906 --> 01:03:33,397
Our whole lives could`ve
changed in an instant.

1530
01:03:33,442 --> 01:03:35,171
I`m not ready for that
with anyone else.

1531
01:03:35,211 --> 01:03:36,610
Great, you could`ve
told me that in person,

1532
01:03:36,846 --> 01:03:38,939
instead of leaving me a note...
Post-it note.

1533
01:03:38,981 --> 01:03:40,949
Yeah, that...

1534
01:03:40,983 --> 01:03:42,951
That wasn`t cool. Sorry.

1535
01:03:44,253 --> 01:03:45,345
It`s okay.

1536
01:03:46,522 --> 01:03:48,353
Thank you for not charging me.

1537
01:03:52,394 --> 01:03:54,362
What`s different about you?

1538
01:03:54,396 --> 01:03:56,990
Oh, l`m stepping up
my work game.

1539
01:03:57,032 --> 01:03:58,431
Trying to impress your sister.

1540
01:03:58,467 --> 01:04:00,025
Good luck with that.

1541
01:04:00,069 --> 01:04:01,366
But...

1542
01:04:01,403 --> 01:04:03,598
You`re not
pregnant though, right?

1543
01:04:03,639 --> 01:04:05,630
Why are you asking me?
We were safe.

1544
01:04:05,875 --> 01:04:07,172
Yeah, but come on...

1545
01:04:07,209 --> 01:04:08,369
Come on what?

1546
01:04:08,410 --> 01:04:09,900
You know the condom broke.

1547
01:04:09,945 --> 01:04:12,004
Yeah, and then you pulled out

1548
01:04:12,047 --> 01:04:13,480
and put another one
on immediately.

1549
01:04:13,515 --> 01:04:14,948
Yeah, and that one broke too.

1550
01:04:14,984 --> 01:04:16,349
And then you put on another one.

1551
01:04:16,385 --> 01:04:17,443
And that one broke.

1552
01:04:17,486 --> 01:04:19,249
The last one broke?

1553
01:04:19,288 --> 01:04:20,880
You did not tell me that!

1554
01:04:20,923 --> 01:04:21,617
I thought you knew.

1555
01:04:21,657 --> 01:04:24,125
And it was a little bit
too late at that point.

1556
01:04:24,159 --> 01:04:25,126
Too late?

1557
01:04:25,160 --> 01:04:26,525
I was finishing.

1558
01:04:26,562 --> 01:04:28,291
And you were telling me
not to stop.

1559
01:04:28,330 --> 01:04:30,025
I thought you felt it break
and didn`t care.

1560
01:04:30,065 --> 01:04:31,032
I care!

1561
01:04:31,066 --> 01:04:33,091
Then why do you have a box
of five-year-old condoms

1562
01:04:33,135 --> 01:04:34,124
in your medicine cabinet.

1563
01:04:34,169 --> 01:04:36,137
There was a layer of dust on
those things like an inch thick.

1564
01:04:36,171 --> 01:04:37,968
I haven`t needed them lately.

1565
01:04:38,007 --> 01:04:41,443
Look, l`m pretty sure that
it broke as I was pulling out,

1566
01:04:41,477 --> 01:04:45,038
so if you`re not pregnant by now
we have nothing to worry about.

1567
01:04:45,080 --> 01:04:47,548
No...
You have nothing to worry about.

1568
01:04:49,418 --> 01:04:50,908
You should just go.

1569
01:04:55,190 --> 01:04:59,058
You...wanna...maybe?

1570
01:04:59,094 --> 01:05:00,561
No. I don`t.

1571
01:05:00,596 --> 01:05:02,564
You need to go. Now. Out.

1572
01:05:02,598 --> 01:05:03,997
All right.

1573
01:05:06,268 --> 01:05:07,929
I like this new color.

1574
01:05:16,178 --> 01:05:17,406
[sighs]

1575
01:05:23,686 --> 01:05:25,654
Hey, did I miss Louis?

1576
01:05:27,222 --> 01:05:28,314
I`m sorry, what?

1577
01:05:28,357 --> 01:05:29,221
My brother.

1578
01:05:29,258 --> 01:05:31,089
Was he in class today?
Did I miss him?

1579
01:05:31,126 --> 01:05:33,094
Oh, yeah he was just here.

1580
01:05:34,196 --> 01:05:36,061
So, how was he?

1581
01:05:36,098 --> 01:05:37,622
In what way?

1582
01:05:37,666 --> 01:05:39,190
As a painter.

1583
01:05:39,234 --> 01:05:42,567
Oh right...
Yeah, of course, l`m...

1584
01:05:42,604 --> 01:05:45,198
I thought that
you meant in class.

1585
01:05:45,240 --> 01:05:47,606
Everything was just fine.
He didn`t even charge me.

1586
01:05:47,643 --> 01:05:50,077
Did you have sex
with my brother?

1587
01:05:50,112 --> 01:05:52,205
I...don`t--

1588
01:05:52,247 --> 01:05:54,477
Oh, my God!
I know that face.

1589
01:05:54,516 --> 01:05:56,381
I`ve been seeing that look
on my friends` faces

1590
01:05:56,418 --> 01:05:57,680
since high school.

1591
01:05:57,720 --> 01:05:59,085
It just happened one night.

1592
01:05:59,121 --> 01:06:01,749
I cannot believe he`s still
doing this shit to Susan.

1593
01:06:01,991 --> 01:06:03,481
But he said that they broke up.

1594
01:06:03,525 --> 01:06:04,617
Yeah.

1595
01:06:04,660 --> 01:06:07,128
He breaks up with her
when it`s convenient for him.

1596
01:06:07,162 --> 01:06:08,493
It won`t happen again.

1597
01:06:08,530 --> 01:06:10,293
No, it won`t.

1598
01:06:10,332 --> 01:06:12,232
You should take
a break for a few days.

1599
01:06:12,267 --> 01:06:13,256
Take a week off.

1600
01:06:13,302 --> 01:06:15,031
Yeah, no...
I don`t really need--

1601
01:06:15,070 --> 01:06:16,298
It`s not a request.

1602
01:06:16,338 --> 01:06:17,498
Take a break!

1603
01:06:22,444 --> 01:06:23,376
[answering machine beep]

1604
01:06:23,412 --> 01:06:25,141
Hey, it`s me.
How`s our baby?

1605
01:06:25,180 --> 01:06:27,080
Are you dealing with
my birthday cake still?

1606
01:06:27,116 --> 01:06:28,743
I think l`m gonna invite Scott

1607
01:06:28,784 --> 01:06:31,252
to have our first
sleepover after my party.

1608
01:06:31,286 --> 01:06:34,517
[beep]
I realized today that I haven`t
had sex with anyone but Tom -

1609
01:06:34,556 --> 01:06:37,116
oh, and you -
in almost seven years.

1610
01:06:37,159 --> 01:06:38,285
That is crazy.

1611
01:06:38,327 --> 01:06:40,056
I`m getting really excited
about Friday night.

1612
01:06:40,095 --> 01:06:40,789
[beep]

1613
01:06:41,030 --> 01:06:42,657
Good morning.
Happy birthday to me!

1614
01:06:42,698 --> 01:06:44,791
I really don`t want to make
this all about me, Jenn...

1615
01:06:45,034 --> 01:06:46,797
but you`re ruining
my birthday - again.

1616
01:06:47,036 --> 01:06:48,799
[beep]
Jennifer, it`s your mother.

1617
01:06:49,038 --> 01:06:51,404
(Matt)
l`m getting worried...
Are you okay?

1618
01:06:51,440 --> 01:06:52,737
Is the baby okay?

1619
01:06:52,775 --> 01:06:54,037
I`m fine.

1620
01:06:54,076 --> 01:06:55,168
The baby`s fine.

1621
01:06:55,210 --> 01:06:56,541
I`m coming right over.

1622
01:06:59,615 --> 01:07:01,640
[music plays,
people chattering]

1623
01:07:12,728 --> 01:07:14,286
- Oh, darn.
- What?

1624
01:07:14,329 --> 01:07:15,421
I forgot the cake.

1625
01:07:15,464 --> 01:07:17,091
Don`t worry,
I took care of it.

1626
01:07:20,169 --> 01:07:21,693
Matt, I have to
tell you something.

1627
01:07:21,737 --> 01:07:23,068
What? Oh, wait...

1628
01:07:23,105 --> 01:07:24,629
It`s not gonna ruin
my birthday, is it?

1629
01:07:24,673 --> 01:07:26,436
Did you see Scott
with someone else?

1630
01:07:26,475 --> 01:07:27,601
- No.
- Oh.

1631
01:07:27,643 --> 01:07:29,110
- How bad could it be then?
- Bad.

1632
01:07:29,745 --> 01:07:32,305
You remember the night that
I went back to my apartment

1633
01:07:32,347 --> 01:07:34,508
for a few hours, and the
house painter was there.

1634
01:07:34,550 --> 01:07:35,448
Mm hmm.

1635
01:07:35,484 --> 01:07:37,452
I accidentally
had sex with him.

1636
01:07:38,353 --> 01:07:39,843
Oh, no, Jenn.

1637
01:07:40,089 --> 01:07:42,489
Do you have
feelings for him or...

1638
01:07:42,524 --> 01:07:44,355
I thought he was a jerk.

1639
01:07:44,393 --> 01:07:46,327
You depressed?
Do you want a hug?

1640
01:07:46,361 --> 01:07:47,521
No.

1641
01:07:47,563 --> 01:07:49,155
And it`s not that.

1642
01:07:49,198 --> 01:07:50,324
Oh.

1643
01:07:50,365 --> 01:07:52,595
Of course, we used a condom,
but it broke.

1644
01:07:53,802 --> 01:07:56,737
And then we used
another condom and it broke...

1645
01:07:56,772 --> 01:07:59,866
And then we used another
condom and that one broke too.

1646
01:08:01,143 --> 01:08:02,804
And it was around
the same time--

1647
01:08:02,845 --> 01:08:05,473
What do you mean, exactly?

1648
01:08:05,514 --> 01:08:09,473
I mean there`s
a really small chance

1649
01:08:09,518 --> 01:08:12,646
that the baby might be his,
and not yours.

1650
01:08:14,890 --> 01:08:16,357
Happy Birthday!

1651
01:08:17,759 --> 01:08:18,885
Surprise!

1652
01:08:19,394 --> 01:08:21,692
Wait, you didn`t tell me
it was a surprise party.

1653
01:08:24,766 --> 01:08:26,563
Oh, great!

1654
01:08:26,668 --> 01:08:28,192
Now you show up.

1655
01:08:30,405 --> 01:08:33,602
Uh, is he...

1656
01:08:33,642 --> 01:08:34,734
He is not okay.

1657
01:08:40,415 --> 01:08:41,905
I`m gonna wait for this...

1658
01:08:42,151 --> 01:08:43,243
For him to come back.

1659
01:08:43,285 --> 01:08:45,378
- Do you need help?
- No, not really.

1660
01:08:45,420 --> 01:08:47,285
Not that kind...
Maybe later.

1661
01:08:48,423 --> 01:08:50,220
Where`s Jenn?

1662
01:08:50,259 --> 01:08:52,420
She texted me.
She needs me.

1663
01:08:52,461 --> 01:08:54,190
Have you seen--
Oh, it`s fine.

1664
01:08:54,229 --> 01:08:55,662
Where`d you get that shirt?

1665
01:08:55,697 --> 01:08:57,358
- Uh...
- lt`s really cute.

1666
01:08:57,399 --> 01:08:58,263
Okay, you can go.

1667
01:08:58,300 --> 01:08:59,426
Oh, she`s in there.

1668
01:08:59,468 --> 01:09:01,265
Oh, aw...

1669
01:09:07,176 --> 01:09:08,302
Should we call him again?

1670
01:09:08,343 --> 01:09:10,208
I already said
he turned his phone off.

1671
01:09:10,245 --> 01:09:11,678
You say a lot of things, Nelson.

1672
01:09:11,713 --> 01:09:13,806
Oh, my God,
this is so not about us.

1673
01:09:13,849 --> 01:09:15,441
How do you guys
know each other?

1674
01:09:15,484 --> 01:09:16,644
We`re bar enemies.

1675
01:09:16,685 --> 01:09:18,619
She used to troll
at the same bar I hung out at.

1676
01:09:18,654 --> 01:09:20,485
Oh, I trolled,
and you hung out?

1677
01:09:20,522 --> 01:09:21,546
That`s what it looked like.

1678
01:09:21,590 --> 01:09:25,549
Anyone who was at The Pipe
at 3 AM was trolling,
including you.

1679
01:09:25,594 --> 01:09:26,561
Guys, stop.

1680
01:09:26,595 --> 01:09:28,563
She`s just mad because
she and I have the same type

1681
01:09:28,597 --> 01:09:29,791
but I always got first choice,

1682
01:09:29,831 --> 01:09:31,526
and she had to settle
for my leftovers.

1683
01:09:31,567 --> 01:09:34,559
And if she believes that,
she is out of his mind.

1684
01:09:34,603 --> 01:09:36,264
Don`t you mix
my gender pronouns.

1685
01:09:36,305 --> 01:09:38,432
I will speak in the
her person whenever I want.

1686
01:09:38,473 --> 01:09:40,566
- Deal with it, aging twink.
- Feminine bear.

1687
01:09:40,609 --> 01:09:42,941
You would be effemina-phobic.
Self-loathe much?

1688
01:09:42,978 --> 01:09:44,912
Don`t you dare.
I own my womanhood.

1689
01:09:44,947 --> 01:09:47,541
I`m a proud Sissy Queen,
Miss Nelly Bear 8.

1690
01:09:47,583 --> 01:09:49,881
Checking out
my online profile again?

1691
01:09:49,918 --> 01:09:51,408
When I need to laugh.

1692
01:09:53,755 --> 01:09:56,622
[cell phone ring tone]
 Hey, girl, hey...

1693
01:09:58,961 --> 01:10:00,451
[whispers]
Hi.

1694
01:10:02,231 --> 01:10:02,993
Uh-huh.

1695
01:10:04,900 --> 01:10:06,424
Uh-huh.

1696
01:10:07,502 --> 01:10:08,491
Okay, bye.

1697
01:10:11,607 --> 01:10:13,006
Was that Matt?

1698
01:10:13,242 --> 01:10:14,368
Yeah.

1699
01:10:16,912 --> 01:10:19,710
He said he won`t come home
until you aren`t here anymore.

1700
01:10:21,283 --> 01:10:22,409
Okay.

1701
01:10:22,451 --> 01:10:25,716
And l`m sure this has nothing
to do with what just happened,

1702
01:10:25,754 --> 01:10:27,949
but he asked if you
could leave your keys.

1703
01:10:29,891 --> 01:10:31,256
Okay.

1704
01:10:53,849 --> 01:10:55,339
I should go after her.

1705
01:10:55,384 --> 01:10:57,045
She probably needs
some time alone.

1706
01:10:57,286 --> 01:10:58,548
But feel free to leave here.

1707
01:10:59,288 --> 01:11:00,516
I despise you.

1708
01:11:00,555 --> 01:11:01,886
Likewise.

1709
01:11:03,592 --> 01:11:08,461
What does the 8 stand for,
Nelly Bear 8?

1710
01:11:08,497 --> 01:11:09,896
What do you think?

1711
01:11:09,931 --> 01:11:12,058
Don`t you flirt with me
if you don`t mean it.

1712
01:11:12,301 --> 01:11:13,529
Woof.

1713
01:11:14,069 --> 01:11:17,368
Bears don`t say, ``Woof.``
They say, ``Grrr.``

1714
01:11:17,406 --> 01:11:18,373
Email me.

1715
01:11:18,407 --> 01:11:19,431
Oh, I will.

1716
01:11:27,816 --> 01:11:32,412
I look and stare
so deep in your eyes

1717
01:11:32,454 --> 01:11:36,413
I touch on you
more and more every time

1718
01:11:36,458 --> 01:11:40,519
When you leave
l`m begging you not to go

1719
01:11:40,562 --> 01:11:42,427
Call your name...

1720
01:11:42,464 --> 01:11:43,488
[answering machine beep]

1721
01:11:43,532 --> 01:11:44,760
Pick up.

1722
01:11:44,800 --> 01:11:46,893
Linda has me covering
all of your classes.

1723
01:11:46,935 --> 01:11:48,994
Please come back to work.
She`ll forgive you.

1724
01:11:49,037 --> 01:11:51,005
And so will Matt...eventually.

1725
01:11:55,877 --> 01:11:56,969
[answering machine beep]

1726
01:11:57,012 --> 01:11:58,036
Good news.

1727
01:11:58,080 --> 01:11:59,445
Warm-Warm Yoga is so popular

1728
01:11:59,481 --> 01:12:00,880
that we`ve added
two extra classes.

1729
01:12:00,916 --> 01:12:02,440
Get it together.

1730
01:12:03,852 --> 01:12:06,480
Got me looking so crazy
right now, your love

1731
01:12:06,521 --> 01:12:10,457
Got me looking
so crazy right now

1732
01:12:10,492 --> 01:12:15,452
Got me looking so crazy
right now, your touch

1733
01:12:15,497 --> 01:12:19,695
Got me looking
so crazy right now

1734
01:12:19,735 --> 01:12:24,138
Got me hoping you`ll save
me right now, your kiss

1735
01:12:25,440 --> 01:12:25,997
[answering machine beep]

1736
01:12:26,041 --> 01:12:28,100
Jennifer, it`s your mother...

1737
01:12:28,143 --> 01:12:30,043
Looking so crazy

1738
01:12:30,078 --> 01:12:32,569
Love got me looking

1739
01:12:32,614 --> 01:12:37,779
Looking so crazy
in love...

1740
01:12:37,819 --> 01:12:45,885
Crazy right now...

1741
01:12:45,927 --> 01:12:52,594
Got me looking,
looking, looking...

1742
01:12:52,634 --> 01:12:55,034
Looking so crazy

1743
01:13:01,543 --> 01:13:02,976
This is incredible.

1744
01:13:03,011 --> 01:13:04,171
It`s the best thing
you`ve ever done.

1745
01:13:04,413 --> 01:13:05,710
It`s just a comic book.

1746
01:13:05,747 --> 01:13:06,771
Super-Gayby?

1747
01:13:06,815 --> 01:13:09,010
I think we both know
exactly what this is about.

1748
01:13:09,050 --> 01:13:10,449
I can`t talk about it.

1749
01:13:10,485 --> 01:13:12,043
Let`s talk about
anything else. Please.

1750
01:13:12,087 --> 01:13:13,418
Anything? Fine.

1751
01:13:13,455 --> 01:13:15,855
I went to dinner with Tom
and his friends last night.

1752
01:13:15,891 --> 01:13:17,688
Awesome...
How is he?

1753
01:13:17,726 --> 01:13:19,591
Still the same - boring.

1754
01:13:19,628 --> 01:13:21,152
He got another
promotion at work.

1755
01:13:21,196 --> 01:13:22,959
Everything comes
so easily to him.

1756
01:13:22,998 --> 01:13:24,795
I know, that always
drove me crazy.

1757
01:13:24,833 --> 01:13:26,824
We have actual challenges,
but we face them.

1758
01:13:26,868 --> 01:13:28,859
Like when I quit
smoking and got fat,

1759
01:13:28,904 --> 01:13:32,772
and got too depressed to shave,
I turned myself into a bear.

1760
01:13:32,808 --> 01:13:34,503
- And you--
- Okay...

1761
01:13:34,543 --> 01:13:36,067
Is this a pep talk?
`Cause I can`t.

1762
01:13:36,111 --> 01:13:37,510
Look...

1763
01:13:37,546 --> 01:13:39,173
It does not matter
whose sperm it was.

1764
01:13:39,214 --> 01:13:40,545
That baby is yours and Jenn`s.

1765
01:13:40,582 --> 01:13:41,913
You`re gonna make
an amazing father.

1766
01:13:41,950 --> 01:13:44,748
I know it.
Could you just not cop out?

1767
01:13:45,020 --> 01:13:46,885
How much for the pink thing?

1768
01:13:46,922 --> 01:13:49,891
That`s a mounted ceramic
elephantine bust - and not now.

1769
01:13:49,925 --> 01:13:51,756
I`m sorry, l`m conversing
with my distressed friend.

1770
01:13:52,594 --> 01:13:54,528
- Bitchy queen.
- Yup.

1771
01:13:54,563 --> 01:13:55,461
And you...

1772
01:13:55,497 --> 01:13:56,828
Can you just be
a father to that baby

1773
01:13:56,865 --> 01:13:58,560
so it doesn`t grow up
to be a douche bag

1774
01:13:58,600 --> 01:14:00,693
Iike everybody else
in this city.

1775
01:14:02,604 --> 01:14:04,094
All the good people
have moved.

1776
01:14:04,940 --> 01:14:06,567
Do you have anything
that will make me

1777
01:14:06,608 --> 01:14:08,667
not want to stay
in bed until I die?

1778
01:14:08,710 --> 01:14:10,940
I can mix something that
will improve your mood.

1779
01:14:10,979 --> 01:14:13,004
Not the horny goat though;
that was a disaster.

1780
01:14:13,048 --> 01:14:16,040
It really is one of the
better energy and mood boosters.

1781
01:14:16,084 --> 01:14:17,779
I don`t need
that kind of energy.

1782
01:14:17,819 --> 01:14:20,253
Okay, we`ll leave it out.
I have a mood mix.

1783
01:14:20,489 --> 01:14:22,821
It will give you vivid dreams,
but it`s really effective.

1784
01:14:22,858 --> 01:14:24,985
But having more energy
and a better mood

1785
01:14:25,026 --> 01:14:27,187
is not gonna solve
all your problems.

1786
01:14:27,229 --> 01:14:28,787
Oh, trust me, I know.

1787
01:14:30,031 --> 01:14:32,022
Hey, Scott.
It`s Matt...

1788
01:14:32,067 --> 01:14:36,128
I got your gift...
the broken watch.

1789
01:14:36,171 --> 01:14:37,638
And I get it.

1790
01:14:37,672 --> 01:14:39,139
I`m cool with taking it slow.

1791
01:14:39,174 --> 01:14:42,610
As long as slow means that
we`re only dating each other,

1792
01:14:42,644 --> 01:14:44,271
and no one else.

1793
01:14:44,513 --> 01:14:45,844
That`s all.

1794
01:14:45,881 --> 01:14:47,815
Gimme a call,
I hope you`re good.

1795
01:14:47,849 --> 01:14:49,111
Okay, bye.

1796
01:14:59,060 --> 01:15:00,789
Wait...
Today`s Wednesday, right?

1797
01:15:00,829 --> 01:15:02,126
Did I come in
on the wrong day?

1798
01:15:02,163 --> 01:15:03,528
No. Yeah, today`s Wednesday.

1799
01:15:03,565 --> 01:15:05,157
So I thought
this was your day off.

1800
01:15:05,200 --> 01:15:06,189
It`s okay.

1801
01:15:06,234 --> 01:15:07,895
I decided to work
on Wednesdays now,

1802
01:15:07,936 --> 01:15:09,767
so I could see
all my industry friends

1803
01:15:09,804 --> 01:15:11,032
who come in on Wednesday.

1804
01:15:11,072 --> 01:15:12,835
Yeah, I get that.

1805
01:15:12,874 --> 01:15:14,933
Good, `cause, um,
I kinda have to ask you

1806
01:15:14,976 --> 01:15:17,604
to not come in
on Wednesdays anymore -

1807
01:15:17,646 --> 01:15:19,170
if that`s okay?

1808
01:15:19,214 --> 01:15:20,306
When should I come in?

1809
01:15:20,549 --> 01:15:23,916
Well, Cosmic Comics
is only five blocks away.

1810
01:15:23,952 --> 01:15:25,749
You could go there.

1811
01:15:25,787 --> 01:15:27,584
It`s closer to where you live.

1812
01:15:27,622 --> 01:15:29,283
I hadn`t thought about that...

1813
01:15:29,324 --> 01:15:31,189
What`s going on
with you today?

1814
01:15:31,226 --> 01:15:33,023
You`re being so...assertive.

1815
01:15:33,562 --> 01:15:37,862
Well, while l`m on a roll,
I have a favor to ask you.

1816
01:15:37,899 --> 01:15:39,298
I finished a book.

1817
01:15:39,334 --> 01:15:43,065
And I think that Kapow
is the perfect fit and...

1818
01:15:43,104 --> 01:15:43,866
Sure, yes.

1819
01:15:43,905 --> 01:15:45,634
I don`t know why you
haven`t asked me before.

1820
01:15:45,674 --> 01:15:46,333
Of course.

1821
01:15:46,575 --> 01:15:48,668
Just send it to me at work.
I`ll show it to Larry.

1822
01:15:48,710 --> 01:15:49,642
Thank you.

1823
01:15:50,812 --> 01:15:51,836
I appreciate it.

1824
01:15:53,214 --> 01:15:55,341
I think l`m gonna go...now.

1825
01:15:58,219 --> 01:15:59,846
It`s good to see you.

1826
01:16:01,790 --> 01:16:03,587
I`m glad you`re doing well.

1827
01:16:08,597 --> 01:16:09,825
I`m proud of you, man!

1828
01:16:09,864 --> 01:16:11,661
Thank you.
Did I do okay?

1829
01:16:11,700 --> 01:16:12,257
Yeah, oh, yeah.

1830
01:16:12,300 --> 01:16:13,358
Victory.

1831
01:16:14,135 --> 01:16:15,659
Wake up.

1832
01:16:15,704 --> 01:16:16,898
We have to talk.

1833
01:16:16,938 --> 01:16:17,962
I can`t.

1834
01:16:18,006 --> 01:16:20,270
You can get pregnant
with a guy or some other guy,

1835
01:16:20,308 --> 01:16:21,866
but you can`t talk
to your sister?

1836
01:16:21,910 --> 01:16:23,844
- Get up!
- Wait. Who told you that?

1837
01:16:23,878 --> 01:16:25,106
Your gay friend.

1838
01:16:25,146 --> 01:16:26,238
You talked to Matt?

1839
01:16:26,281 --> 01:16:28,215
- No, the other one.
- Jamie?

1840
01:16:28,249 --> 01:16:30,717
Who can keep track of names
with all your gay friends?

1841
01:16:30,752 --> 01:16:32,379
I mean, having a girlfriend
wouldn`t kill you.

1842
01:16:32,621 --> 01:16:33,952
Well, who could live up to you?

1843
01:16:33,989 --> 01:16:34,956
Shut up.

1844
01:16:35,790 --> 01:16:37,690
Look...

1845
01:16:37,726 --> 01:16:39,387
My adoption isn`t working out.

1846
01:16:39,628 --> 01:16:42,096
So...I have a solution.

1847
01:16:43,231 --> 01:16:44,823
Give me your baby.

1848
01:16:44,866 --> 01:16:46,390
Wha-- What?

1849
01:16:46,635 --> 01:16:48,227
You can barely
take care of yourself.

1850
01:16:48,269 --> 01:16:49,293
How are you gonna
handle a baby?

1851
01:16:49,337 --> 01:16:50,804
I do just fine.

1852
01:16:50,839 --> 01:16:52,033
Do you even have a job anymore

1853
01:16:52,073 --> 01:16:53,802
after banging
your boss` brother?

1854
01:16:53,842 --> 01:16:55,867
Jamie told you that too?

1855
01:16:55,910 --> 01:16:56,877
He told me everything.

1856
01:16:56,911 --> 01:16:58,105
I bought him lunch.
He`s a cheap date.

1857
01:16:58,146 --> 01:17:00,808
You know, I can get
a new job any day.

1858
01:17:00,849 --> 01:17:02,874
Let`s be real here.

1859
01:17:02,917 --> 01:17:06,011
I have a husband...
with a great job.

1860
01:17:06,054 --> 01:17:07,885
I have a nursery ready.

1861
01:17:07,922 --> 01:17:10,152
I can do hair if I want,
but I don`t need to work.

1862
01:17:12,193 --> 01:17:15,060
Wait...
Are you serious?

1863
01:17:15,096 --> 01:17:17,155
Yeah, your kid would
have a better life with me.

1864
01:17:17,198 --> 01:17:18,893
Who the hell
do you think you are?

1865
01:17:18,933 --> 01:17:20,366
A baby needs two parents.

1866
01:17:20,402 --> 01:17:21,994
This baby has two parents.

1867
01:17:22,037 --> 01:17:24,267
Almost three.
But I mean real parents.

1868
01:17:24,305 --> 01:17:25,932
When Matt forgives me,

1869
01:17:25,974 --> 01:17:28,067
he`s going to be
an amazing father.

1870
01:17:28,109 --> 01:17:30,100
He works at a comic book store
like a fat person.

1871
01:17:30,145 --> 01:17:33,046
Since when does parenting
have to do with your job,

1872
01:17:33,081 --> 01:17:34,708
or your money,
or your waistline?

1873
01:17:34,749 --> 01:17:36,114
How much money do you have?

1874
01:17:37,052 --> 01:17:39,350
Are you planning on
getting yours from the trust?

1875
01:17:39,387 --> 01:17:40,854
I can block it.

1876
01:17:40,889 --> 01:17:41,947
Uncle Henry
always listens to me.

1877
01:17:41,990 --> 01:17:43,014
You know that.

1878
01:17:43,058 --> 01:17:45,993
I don`t need that money.
I am great at what I do.

1879
01:17:46,027 --> 01:17:49,190
My latest class is a smash
and I can teach it anywhere.

1880
01:17:49,230 --> 01:17:51,198
And you can
raise a baby alone...

1881
01:17:51,232 --> 01:17:52,961
even if Matt
doesn`t forgive you?

1882
01:17:53,001 --> 01:17:55,299
- You really think that`s true?
- I know that it`s true.

1883
01:17:55,336 --> 01:17:56,769
I love this baby.

1884
01:17:56,805 --> 01:17:57,965
I`m going to do
everything in my power

1885
01:17:58,006 --> 01:17:59,906
to make sure
it has the best life.

1886
01:18:02,977 --> 01:18:04,069
Good.

1887
01:18:05,380 --> 01:18:07,848
Now go take a shower
and get yourself together.

1888
01:18:07,882 --> 01:18:09,042
We have a big day ahead of us.

1889
01:18:09,084 --> 01:18:10,813
Wait, are you off your meds?

1890
01:18:10,852 --> 01:18:13,150
Come on, Jenn,
it`s called tough love.

1891
01:18:13,188 --> 01:18:15,349
Do you really think
I wanted your baby?

1892
01:18:15,390 --> 01:18:17,085
I don`t need two.

1893
01:18:17,125 --> 01:18:19,958
Sade is coming next week.
I totally fibbed.

1894
01:18:19,994 --> 01:18:22,792
Really? That`s so fantastic.

1895
01:18:22,831 --> 01:18:24,822
Wait, Sade?
It`s not Sadie?

1896
01:18:24,866 --> 01:18:26,060
Sade is cooler.

1897
01:18:26,768 --> 01:18:27,735
Yeah.

1898
01:18:29,137 --> 01:18:30,866
I think that fight
might have been

1899
01:18:30,905 --> 01:18:33,169
the most amazing thing
you`ve ever done for me.

1900
01:18:33,208 --> 01:18:34,402
I know.

1901
01:18:34,442 --> 01:18:35,841
I`m fantastic.

1902
01:18:36,945 --> 01:18:37,934
Now come on.

1903
01:18:37,979 --> 01:18:40,209
Go get your job
and your gay daddy back,

1904
01:18:40,248 --> 01:18:42,148
so we can shop for
our babies all weekend.

1905
01:18:59,400 --> 01:19:00,799
So, you`re not dead.

1906
01:19:00,835 --> 01:19:03,133
I should kill you
for telling my sister...

1907
01:19:03,171 --> 01:19:04,536
but thanks.

1908
01:19:04,773 --> 01:19:05,865
You`re welcome.

1909
01:19:06,441 --> 01:19:07,305
Where`s Valerie?

1910
01:19:07,342 --> 01:19:08,934
She left to get her PhD.

1911
01:19:08,977 --> 01:19:10,137
Oh, wow.

1912
01:19:10,178 --> 01:19:11,543
Is Linda here?

1913
01:19:11,780 --> 01:19:12,974
She`s in her office.

1914
01:19:14,916 --> 01:19:15,974
Good luck.

1915
01:19:20,021 --> 01:19:21,283
Hi, Linda, l`m here.

1916
01:19:22,991 --> 01:19:25,289
I`m really sorry
I slept with your brother.

1917
01:19:25,326 --> 01:19:28,159
I`ve been trying to get pregnant
and I was basically in heat.

1918
01:19:28,196 --> 01:19:30,164
And we had a kind of
an animal moment--

1919
01:19:30,198 --> 01:19:33,065
Stop. I don`t wanna hear
anymore about that.

1920
01:19:33,101 --> 01:19:34,193
Of course.

1921
01:19:35,937 --> 01:19:38,838
You know, l`m coming into
some money soon.

1922
01:19:38,873 --> 01:19:40,966
It`s not a lot, but...

1923
01:19:41,009 --> 01:19:43,944
I was thinking maybe I could
buy into the business,

1924
01:19:43,978 --> 01:19:45,536
so I can have a stake,

1925
01:19:45,580 --> 01:19:47,207
and maybe a future here.

1926
01:19:48,349 --> 01:19:49,577
Oh, that`s interesting.

1927
01:19:51,219 --> 01:19:52,914
I would love to go on vacation.

1928
01:19:52,954 --> 01:19:54,444
I`m ready to do it.

1929
01:19:54,489 --> 01:19:58,585
You know, your Warm-Warm
Yoga idea has really taken off -

1930
01:19:58,827 --> 01:20:00,351
even with the silly name.

1931
01:20:00,395 --> 01:20:02,556
Why don`t we go
to the park tomorrow

1932
01:20:02,597 --> 01:20:04,997
and get a yogurt
and discuss it?

1933
01:20:05,033 --> 01:20:06,398
That sounds really nice.

1934
01:20:08,102 --> 01:20:10,969
I always meant to be friendlier.

1935
01:20:11,940 --> 01:20:14,534
I am jealous of what
you and Jamie have.

1936
01:20:14,576 --> 01:20:18,444
Maybe we could restart
our friendship today.

1937
01:20:18,479 --> 01:20:20,174
Okay.

1938
01:20:21,950 --> 01:20:24,475
Hey, when you go
will you take that package out

1939
01:20:24,519 --> 01:20:27,113
and give it to Jamie
to take to the post office?

1940
01:20:28,523 --> 01:20:29,547
Yeah, sure.

1941
01:20:30,491 --> 01:20:31,458
Thanks.

1942
01:20:34,429 --> 01:20:36,522
Oh, a package.
That`s good news.

1943
01:20:36,564 --> 01:20:37,963
It means you weren`t fired.

1944
01:20:37,999 --> 01:20:40,024
Actually, it`s for you.

1945
01:20:40,068 --> 01:20:41,000
Bitch.

1946
01:20:41,035 --> 01:20:42,195
I`ll take it.
I have my moped.

1947
01:20:42,237 --> 01:20:43,431
Should you even
be riding that thing?

1948
01:20:43,471 --> 01:20:44,495
I`m pregnant...

1949
01:20:44,539 --> 01:20:45,506
I ride a moped...

1950
01:20:45,540 --> 01:20:47,098
I teach hot yoga...

1951
01:20:47,141 --> 01:20:48,267
I rock.

1952
01:20:48,309 --> 01:20:50,504
Work. Take a day off.

1953
01:20:50,545 --> 01:20:51,978
And then work.

1954
01:20:52,013 --> 01:20:53,378
- Work.
- Work.

1955
01:20:54,482 --> 01:20:56,245
Yeah, yeah, yeah...

1956
01:21:09,163 --> 01:21:10,528
I`m gonna get a coffee.

1957
01:21:19,140 --> 01:21:20,129
Hi, l`m Neil.

1958
01:21:20,174 --> 01:21:21,664
Hi, l`m Jenn.

1959
01:21:28,182 --> 01:21:29,513
He`s really cute.

1960
01:21:29,550 --> 01:21:31,415
Well, why don`t you
have sex with him too?

1961
01:21:31,452 --> 01:21:32,578
He`s single.

1962
01:21:35,189 --> 01:21:36,952
Matt, l`m sorry.

1963
01:21:36,991 --> 01:21:38,117
I don`t want to hear it.

1964
01:21:38,159 --> 01:21:39,626
It`s not about that.

1965
01:21:40,461 --> 01:21:41,485
About what then?

1966
01:21:44,065 --> 01:21:46,158
I stopped talking
to you in college

1967
01:21:46,200 --> 01:21:48,930
because the very next night
after we had sex,

1968
01:21:48,970 --> 01:21:51,404
you made out with Josh Spitz,
right in front of me.

1969
01:21:53,107 --> 01:21:55,098
And you were jealous?

1970
01:21:55,143 --> 01:21:57,577
You knew that I had
the hugest crush on him,

1971
01:21:57,612 --> 01:21:59,705
and you always said
you thought he was gross.

1972
01:21:59,948 --> 01:22:02,314
He was so gay though, Jenn.

1973
01:22:02,350 --> 01:22:04,045
I have no gaydar.

1974
01:22:04,085 --> 01:22:05,552
It`s my thing.

1975
01:22:06,621 --> 01:22:08,589
And it seemed like you
were doing it on purpose,

1976
01:22:08,623 --> 01:22:11,956
because you didn`t want me
to get any ideas about us.

1977
01:22:11,993 --> 01:22:13,551
No, not at all.

1978
01:22:13,594 --> 01:22:16,358
I think I was high on ecstasy.

1979
01:22:18,533 --> 01:22:20,023
- Really?
- Yeah.

1980
01:22:20,068 --> 01:22:22,195
I think I was
really, really high on ecstasy

1981
01:22:22,236 --> 01:22:23,498
and I made out with him

1982
01:22:23,538 --> 01:22:25,335
because he was
standing in front of me.

1983
01:22:29,444 --> 01:22:30,411
Wow.

1984
01:22:31,980 --> 01:22:33,208
I was really hurt.

1985
01:22:34,649 --> 01:22:36,412
I thought it was all about me.

1986
01:22:37,385 --> 01:22:38,977
You often do.

1987
01:22:41,990 --> 01:22:45,255
Matt, it is gonna be our baby,
no matter what.

1988
01:22:45,293 --> 01:22:46,692
Damn right it is.

1989
01:22:49,097 --> 01:22:52,066
You should have just
told me right away...

1990
01:22:52,100 --> 01:22:54,500
and not on my birthday,
at my party.

1991
01:22:54,535 --> 01:22:56,230
I have a new rule -
never on a birthday.

1992
01:22:56,270 --> 01:22:57,532
Never on my birthday.

1993
01:22:59,140 --> 01:23:01,040
It really was an accident.

1994
01:23:01,075 --> 01:23:04,238
And I didn`t have sex
with anyone for months.

1995
01:23:04,278 --> 01:23:06,769
I blew up at Scott
on my birthday.

1996
01:23:07,015 --> 01:23:08,175
I`m really sorry.

1997
01:23:08,216 --> 01:23:11,049
I`ll let you know when l`m
ready to accept your apology.

1998
01:23:24,165 --> 01:23:25,325
- Now?
- No.

1999
01:23:35,076 --> 01:23:36,270
- Now?
- No!

2000
01:23:54,328 --> 01:23:55,295
Now?

2001
01:23:55,329 --> 01:23:57,422
Okay, but only because we have
a lot of baby planning to do.

2002
01:24:04,839 --> 01:24:05,737
Let`s do it again.

2003
01:24:05,773 --> 01:24:07,297
No, I gotta go pump.

2004
01:24:07,341 --> 01:24:08,399
Can I help?

2005
01:24:08,443 --> 01:24:09,842
You`ve done enough already.

2006
01:24:10,078 --> 01:24:11,739
Can`t you just tell them
you`re gonna be a little late?

2007
01:24:11,779 --> 01:24:13,246
No, it`s Matt`s birthday.

2008
01:24:13,614 --> 01:24:14,706
Hi.

2009
01:24:20,088 --> 01:24:22,852
Jenn, Jenn, Jenn...
You know no shoes on this floor.

2010
01:24:23,257 --> 01:24:25,555
I need that milk, and sanitize.

2011
01:24:25,593 --> 01:24:26,719
Hey, do we--

2012
01:24:26,761 --> 01:24:28,456
Shh...
Logan`s trying to sleep.

2013
01:24:32,633 --> 01:24:34,498
Hey. You look good.
What took you so long?

2014
01:24:34,535 --> 01:24:35,866
Neil`s downstairs.

2015
01:24:36,104 --> 01:24:37,469
We finally had sex.

2016
01:24:37,505 --> 01:24:38,767
Like a whole bunch of times.

2017
01:24:38,806 --> 01:24:39,864
Did you use a condom?

2018
01:24:40,108 --> 01:24:41,234
What`s a condom?

2019
01:24:41,275 --> 01:24:42,333
Of course we used a condom.

2020
01:24:42,376 --> 01:24:44,571
Okay, I know you know this,
so forgive me,

2021
01:24:44,612 --> 01:24:46,443
but don`t let him
stay up past 8 or 8: 1 5,

2022
01:24:46,481 --> 01:24:47,607
otherwise he`ll be up all night.

2023
01:24:47,648 --> 01:24:49,616
- l`m his mommy too.
- I know, sorry.

2024
01:24:49,650 --> 01:24:51,277
Jeez, he`s like super-daddy.

2025
01:24:51,319 --> 01:24:52,308
Thank God.

2026
01:24:52,353 --> 01:24:54,412
Can you imagine if we had
to raise a kid by ourselves?

[baby coos]

2028
01:24:57,525 --> 01:24:59,186
I absolutely cannot.

2029
01:24:59,227 --> 01:25:00,216
Me either.

2030
01:25:01,262 --> 01:25:03,628
Oh, birthday...

2031
01:25:03,664 --> 01:25:06,792
Happy...birthday.

2032
01:25:06,834 --> 01:25:09,462
Oh, you framed it!
That`s so sweet.

2033
01:25:09,504 --> 01:25:11,699
Hey, look, look...

2034
01:25:11,739 --> 01:25:13,297
It`s you.

2035
01:25:13,341 --> 01:25:14,865
And that`s me.

2036
01:25:14,909 --> 01:25:15,898
And that`s him.

2037
01:25:16,144 --> 01:25:17,634
- And that`s your mommy.
- That`s her!

2038
01:25:18,179 --> 01:25:19,339
Where should I put it?

2039
01:25:19,380 --> 01:25:20,608
Just put it right here.

2040
01:25:23,151 --> 01:25:24,379
Thank you!

2041
01:25:24,418 --> 01:25:26,579
- You`re welcome.
- So much!

2042
01:25:26,621 --> 01:25:27,610
Love you.

2043
01:25:27,655 --> 01:25:29,145
I wish you could
come with us tonight,

2044
01:25:29,190 --> 01:25:30,680
but he wants to have
the night out alone.

2045
01:25:31,592 --> 01:25:33,526
He has a surprise for me.

2046
01:25:33,561 --> 01:25:34,687
I know...

2047
01:25:34,729 --> 01:25:37,596
I am so excited that he`s
going to ask you to marry him.

2048
01:25:39,500 --> 01:25:40,524
What?

2049
01:25:40,568 --> 01:25:42,559
You looked like you knew.
You didn`t know?

2050
01:25:42,603 --> 01:25:43,535
No!

2051
01:25:43,571 --> 01:25:46,540
I am...
a compulsive birthday ruiner.

2052
01:25:46,574 --> 01:25:47,871
No, it`s okay.

2053
01:25:47,909 --> 01:25:50,241
It`s more than okay...

2054
01:25:54,782 --> 01:25:57,250
Okay, guys, we gotta go.
We have reservations.

2055
01:25:57,285 --> 01:25:58,252
Yes.

2056
01:25:58,286 --> 01:25:59,651
Bye little one.
I`m gonna miss you.

2057
01:26:00,955 --> 01:26:02,252
Bye-bye.

2058
01:26:09,330 --> 01:26:10,422
Wow.

2059
01:26:10,464 --> 01:26:12,455
You really do
look just like your daddy.
