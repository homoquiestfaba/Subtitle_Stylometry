1
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:48,772
The war between sorcerers
was fought...

2
00:00:48,876 --> 00:00:50,465
in the shadows of history.

3
00:00:50,568 --> 00:00:57,009
And the fate of mankind rested with
the just and powerful ... Merlin.

4
00:00:57,358 --> 00:01:00,683
He taught his secrets to
three trusted apprentices.

5
00:01:00,789 --> 00:01:05,964
Balthazar, Veronica and Horvath.

6
00:01:06,074 --> 00:01:09,206
He should have trusted only two...

7
00:01:15,315 --> 00:01:20,532
Veronica and Balthazar witnessed the savagery
of a sorcerer beyond evil ...

8
00:01:24,806 --> 00:01:29,842
Morgana Le Fay, Merlin's most deadly enemy.

9
00:01:44,853 --> 00:01:48,317
We are but servants.

10
00:01:49,111 --> 00:01:51,578
- Merlin.
- Horvath.

11
00:01:52,119 --> 00:01:55,284
You betray me?

12
00:01:56,651 --> 00:02:00,538
I am no one's servant.

13
00:02:00,645 --> 00:02:02,788
Well done.
Now get the spell.

14
00:02:02,892 --> 00:02:07,775
And so it was, Morgana gained the sorcerer's
most dangerous spell.

15
00:02:07,884 --> 00:02:10,405
Known as "The Rising".

16
00:02:10,510 --> 00:02:13,110
Giving Morgana the power to raise an army of the
dead ...

17
00:02:13,214 --> 00:02:16,070
and enslave mankind

18
00:02:29,711 --> 00:02:35,836
Veronica sacrificed herself for Balthazar, by pouring
Morgana's soul into her own body.

19
00:02:35,946 --> 00:02:40,212
But Morgana began to kill her
from the inside.

20
00:02:40,968 --> 00:02:44,265
To save Veronica's life
and to capture Morgana

21
00:02:44,371 --> 00:02:47,981
Balthazar trapped them both in
the Grim Hold ...

22
00:02:48,087 --> 00:02:51,739
An inescapable prison

23
00:02:51,846 --> 00:02:54,053
Over time, Balthazar fought ...

24
00:02:54,158 --> 00:02:56,472
many sorcerers who tried to free
Morgana.

25
00:02:56,576 --> 00:03:00,706
Trapping them in layer upon layer of the doll

26
00:03:00,813 --> 00:03:04,898
Eventually he captured Horvath as well.

27
00:03:05,424 --> 00:03:09,959
As Merlin lay dying, he gave
Balthazar his dragon ring saying ...

28
00:03:10,067 --> 00:03:14,723
it would guide him to the child
who would one day grow to be Merlin's successor,

29
00:03:14,831 --> 00:03:16,603
the Prime Merlinian.

30
00:03:16,707 --> 00:03:22,338
The Prime Merlinian is the only one who can kill
Morgana.

31
00:03:22,449 --> 00:03:26,459
Balthazar would search for centuries.

32
00:03:40,355 --> 00:03:44,530
And never it is said, will Balthazar
waiver from his quest.

33
00:03:44,637 --> 00:03:47,198
For mankind will never be safe,

34
00:03:47,303 --> 00:03:53,270
Until Morgana is destroyed
by the Prime Merlinian.

35
00:04:01,176 --> 00:04:04,048
Hey, Tank.
How did you get up here?

36
00:04:04,153 --> 00:04:08,767
David? Field trip today.
Don't forget to wear clean underwear

37
00:04:08,876 --> 00:04:12,029
She means me, not you.

38
00:04:36,508 --> 00:04:39,487
You're not supposed to be doing that, Dave.

39
00:04:39,724 --> 00:04:42,449
Look, now.

40
00:04:43,241 --> 00:04:47,654
David.
That is cool.

41
00:04:55,426 --> 00:04:58,438
THE SORCERER'S APPRENTICE

42
00:04:58,743 --> 00:05:05,200
<i>...Before Ellis Island and the Statue of Liberty
were even built, there were ..</i>

43
00:05:05,713 --> 00:05:08,540
- Give it to Becky.
- Pass it on.

44
00:05:08,784 --> 00:05:12,401
- Give it to Becky.
- Here.

45
00:05:13,544 --> 00:05:17,339
<i>I would like to be David's
friend girl friend.</i>

46
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:45,331
Hey, stop.

47
00:06:00,089 --> 00:06:02,541
Excuse me.

48
00:06:02,646 --> 00:06:04,475
no...

49
00:06:04,578 --> 00:06:07,539
No way, don't.

50
00:06:27,411 --> 00:06:30,224
Arcana Cabaña
Founded in 1888

51
00:07:09,906 --> 00:07:13,017
No way ..

52
00:07:23,574 --> 00:07:28,374
The second emperor of the Han Dynasty,
locked his least favorite wife in this urn...

53
00:07:28,483 --> 00:07:31,846
for ten years... to the day

54
00:07:31,952 --> 00:07:36,322
They say if you open it up,
the same thing will happen to you.

55
00:07:36,429 --> 00:07:38,437
I'm sorry.
I'm looking for this note.

56
00:07:38,541 --> 00:07:42,086
Have you seen it?
It's kinda just blown to your store

57
00:07:42,192 --> 00:07:44,904
- A note?
- It was blown to your store.

58
00:07:45,010 --> 00:07:48,429
- It was just a...
- Coincidence.

59
00:07:48,535 --> 00:07:51,656
Yeah, it was just a coincidence.

60
00:07:55,832 --> 00:07:57,910
I have something I'd like to show you, Dave.

61
00:07:58,014 --> 00:08:02,087
- How'd you know my name was Dave?
- Coz I can read minds!

62
00:08:03,535 --> 00:08:06,658
It's on your backpack.

63
00:08:08,357 --> 00:08:11,241
Come over here.

64
00:08:23,213 --> 00:08:28,836
This is very special, and if it likes you,
you can keep it

65
00:08:29,064 --> 00:08:33,702
I better not. My teacher said I can't be gone for long.
She knows I'm here.

66
00:08:33,811 --> 00:08:38,647
You're a bad liar, Dave.
That is good.

67
00:08:43,862 --> 00:08:46,499
Oh boy

68
00:09:11,336 --> 00:09:17,784
- No way
- I have been searching for a very long time.

69
00:09:19,102 --> 00:09:22,403
Magically, here you are.

70
00:09:22,509 --> 00:09:26,067
That ring on your finger
means something, Dave.

71
00:09:26,173 --> 00:09:31,782
It means you're going to be
a very important sorcerer one day

72
00:09:31,892 --> 00:09:37,337
And your first lesson begins right now,
with your very own Incantus.

73
00:09:37,447 --> 00:09:41,653
Do not move, do not touch anything.

74
00:10:38,658 --> 00:10:41,812
No way

75
00:10:58,948 --> 00:11:02,457
- When am I?
- New York City.

76
00:11:02,563 --> 00:11:11,200
Not 'where'. The year.
You are wasting my time.

77
00:11:14,512 --> 00:11:17,780
"Don't touch anything?"

78
00:11:17,886 --> 00:11:21,497
- That's not very sporting of you, Balthazar.
- Be quiet.

79
00:11:21,604 --> 00:11:25,844
It's not you. He's been like this for a thousand years.
I'll explain later.

80
00:11:25,952 --> 00:11:29,749
I need the Grim Hold
Where is that doll?

81
00:12:09,223 --> 00:12:12,424
I'll have that doll

82
00:12:56,034 --> 00:12:59,239
I want that doll.

83
00:13:04,789 --> 00:13:08,541
Leave, Dave!
Leave now!

84
00:13:17,117 --> 00:13:18,973
David Stutler. Never leave your...

85
00:13:19,076 --> 00:13:22,259
There are strange magicians there.
They are made of roaches.

86
00:13:22,365 --> 00:13:27,745
No. Don't go in there. The shop is on fire.
Do not go inside. These guys are...

87
00:13:30,678 --> 00:13:33,346
...Crazy.

88
00:13:35,582 --> 00:13:38,765
You really shouldn't tell stories. Let's go

89
00:13:40,804 --> 00:13:43,881
Eew. He peed in his pants.

90
00:13:45,268 --> 00:13:48,670
A jar broke.
It's just water. There was a fire.

91
00:13:48,777 --> 00:13:53,326
Stutler. He's an idiot.

92
00:14:14,968 --> 00:14:19,453
TEN YEARS LATER
TODAY

93
00:14:24,266 --> 00:14:27,960
Good morn.... What is that... Oh, right.

94
00:14:28,185 --> 00:14:31,454
Good morning, beautiful.

95
00:14:33,775 --> 00:14:36,023
Hey, heads up.

96
00:14:36,127 --> 00:14:38,143
Happy birthday.

97
00:14:38,247 --> 00:14:42,388
- Thank you, Bennet.
- You're up early.

98
00:14:42,496 --> 00:14:47,730
Mr. Hiedermann wants me to give a
presentation to his physics 101 class.

99
00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:49,637
What? Teaching long division to English majors?

100
00:14:49,741 --> 00:14:52,472
I know, it's like the Peace Corps,
but it's Hiedermann's class.

101
00:14:52,576 --> 00:14:55,683
Hey, Bio nerds are getting drunk tonight.

102
00:14:55,789 --> 00:15:00,632
...and we invited cheerleaders
from Princeton.

103
00:15:00,741 --> 00:15:04,167
Oh! So they're smart cheerleaders?

104
00:15:04,274 --> 00:15:09,339
So. Seriously? You're saying you don't
wanna go out on your birthday?

105
00:15:10,192 --> 00:15:14,173
I got to finish my Tesla coil project,
if I wanna graduate.

106
00:15:15,937 --> 00:15:19,491
Dave... are you familiar with the gray wolf?

107
00:15:19,597 --> 00:15:22,441
No, please, Bennet. Not this again with
the gray wolf. I can't...

108
00:15:22,546 --> 00:15:25,019
The gray wolf is a pack animal.

109
00:15:25,124 --> 00:15:31,600
He must find a mate. He must
hunt and grunt. He must participate.

110
00:15:31,712 --> 00:15:34,328
You're gonna get voted out of the pack.

111
00:15:34,433 --> 00:15:37,329
Alone. Eaten by
a hungry bear.

112
00:15:37,434 --> 00:15:43,239
That's a real pick-me-up pep talk,
and I'm ready to go get the day.

113
00:15:46,951 --> 00:15:54,180
What? No, no, man...

114
00:15:57,152 --> 00:16:00,489
Is everything okay down there?

115
00:16:03,846 --> 00:16:09,140
- I should just leave, right?
- Right.

116
00:16:16,627 --> 00:16:21,840
Wait, I'm sorry.
Becky? Becky Barnes.

117
00:16:25,242 --> 00:16:30,658
Dave...
We were in fourth grade together.

118
00:16:30,768 --> 00:16:35,238
- I do know you. Dave Stutler, right?
- That's me.

119
00:16:35,473 --> 00:16:39,512
You're that kid that the...
What is that place called? Arcana...

120
00:16:39,619 --> 00:16:45,333
- Arcana Cabana?
- Yeah. So, did you transfer?

121
00:16:45,444 --> 00:16:49,604
Yeah. I did. And got some help. treatments.

122
00:16:49,711 --> 00:16:52,612
Yes. That was weird.

123
00:16:52,718 --> 00:16:56,360
Yeah. You know what?
It turns out it's just a glucose imbalance

124
00:16:56,467 --> 00:17:00,113
Hallucinations?
Not uncommon in young subjects.

125
00:17:00,219 --> 00:17:05,951
- Ah, right.
- That's a great anecdote.

126
00:17:22,698 --> 00:17:25,220
Hey, Becky.

127
00:17:25,324 --> 00:17:27,707
Becky. Hey, hey, Becky?

128
00:17:27,812 --> 00:17:31,005
So how are you enjoying physics 101?

129
00:17:31,111 --> 00:17:36,124
- My .. my brain does not thinks physics.
- So what does it think then?

130
00:17:36,233 --> 00:17:38,573
Music, mostly.

131
00:17:38,678 --> 00:17:40,701
So, this is me.

132
00:17:40,804 --> 00:17:45,207
- You work at a radio station?
- Yeah, I do an afternoon show.

133
00:17:45,316 --> 00:17:49,648
- Are you kidding me? That's so cool.
- It's just college radio.

134
00:17:49,755 --> 00:17:51,469
Like seven people listen to it.

135
00:17:51,573 --> 00:17:55,929
Oh no, well, I'll be listening. That's one more.
You can round it up to eight.

136
00:17:58,339 --> 00:18:00,565
I think that's our antenna.

137
00:18:00,669 --> 00:18:03,894
- What's going on?
- Hey gorgeous, the whole mixer is toasted

138
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,407
and Freddy called in sick.

139
00:18:08,101 --> 00:18:12,847
Sorry to bother you.
Where does your engineer keep his equipment?

140
00:18:12,955 --> 00:18:15,001
Who is this guy?

141
00:18:15,106 --> 00:18:22,585
So, the good news is you're still transmitting.
The bad news. your antenna loss- way too high

142
00:18:25,285 --> 00:18:33,349
Alright. If I know what I'm doing,
We.. should .. be .. good!

143
00:18:36,943 --> 00:18:39,777
- Thank you.
- No, please. It's my pleasure.

144
00:18:39,883 --> 00:18:42,843
I could tell that ..this is all
this is pretty important for you.

145
00:18:42,948 --> 00:18:48,808
My show is like the one thing that...
You know.

146
00:18:50,245 --> 00:18:54,634
Physics. That's my thing.

147
00:19:04,511 --> 00:19:07,738
- I'll see you around.
- You didn't ask her out!

148
00:19:07,844 --> 00:19:09,659
You just fixed their antenna
and you left.

149
00:19:09,763 --> 00:19:13,938
That's not the point.
She will remember me

150
00:19:14,045 --> 00:19:17,177
She will remember me?
Who are you? Braveheart?

151
00:19:17,283 --> 00:19:20,541
Bennet, I blew my shot of
getting this girl ten years ago...

152
00:19:20,647 --> 00:19:25,997
I can't do it again. Now, get out of here
before you get electrocuted.

153
00:19:26,553 --> 00:19:28,634
...And it's a miracle we
made it on the air tonight

154
00:19:28,738 --> 00:19:31,376
This show may not matter,
but the music does.

155
00:19:31,482 --> 00:19:37,253
This is Becky Barnes, WNYU Radio,
hoping there's music all around you.

156
00:20:08,122 --> 00:20:12,305
I don't understand why did you
have to buy this piece of junk?

157
00:20:12,412 --> 00:20:15,084
Junk? It's an antique.

158
00:20:15,189 --> 00:20:19,268
Antique? It's a piece of junk
from a plea market.

159
00:20:34,318 --> 00:20:37,609
Am I the first one out?

160
00:20:38,747 --> 00:20:43,599
That's a yes.
Our ten years are up, Balthazar.

161
00:20:43,943 --> 00:20:49,420
When I get the Grim Hold from young David,
I'll tell him you said hello.

162
00:20:50,049 --> 00:20:53,084
Cheerio, Balthazar.

163
00:21:39,758 --> 00:21:45,028
Dave Stutler
Rm 184th Grade B-

164
00:21:45,138 --> 00:21:47,625
I thought B- was generous.

165
00:21:47,730 --> 00:21:50,342
I've recently been released from
a ten-year sentence..

166
00:21:50,447 --> 00:21:53,301
During which the only reading material available to me...

167
00:21:53,406 --> 00:21:58,334
was your so called report on Napoleon Bonaparte,
from your school bag.

168
00:21:58,443 --> 00:22:01,234
Your analysis was obvious,
your prose was weak.

169
00:22:01,339 --> 00:22:03,684
- I was nine!
- Irrelevant!

170
00:22:03,789 --> 00:22:07,430
Where's the Grim Hold?
That doll you took from the shop.

171
00:22:07,537 --> 00:22:12,803
The doll held something very powerful,
something very important ... to me.

172
00:22:12,912 --> 00:22:15,876
You had it last.
I want it back.

173
00:22:15,982 --> 00:22:20,505
- Listen, I threw it in the street.
- Where's the Grim Hold?

174
00:22:20,613 --> 00:22:24,222
It's been a long time ago.
I don't actually know where it is.

175
00:22:25,549 --> 00:22:29,736
I'll cut the truth out of you.

176
00:22:36,037 --> 00:22:38,694
Sweet ..

177
00:22:39,947 --> 00:22:42,720
Get him.

178
00:22:42,825 --> 00:22:46,836
Wolves? No, no, no.

179
00:22:58,378 --> 00:23:00,378
PLEASE SWIPE AGAIN

180
00:23:00,411 --> 00:23:03,606
GO.
- Thank you.

181
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:23,038
Oh man, oh man. What?

182
00:23:24,934 --> 00:23:27,814
Oh, no, no.

183
00:23:32,983 --> 00:23:35,134
Kill him.

184
00:23:35,239 --> 00:23:37,864
No.

185
00:23:40,371 --> 00:23:43,235
Puppies?

186
00:23:47,717 --> 00:23:50,551
Oh my...

187
00:23:50,991 --> 00:23:54,657
- No way.
- Where's the doll, Dave?

188
00:23:54,764 --> 00:23:57,736
Him .. him ...
Him... him... him...

189
00:24:00,895 --> 00:24:04,287
Alright, get up here now!
Now! Hurry!

190
00:24:36,668 --> 00:24:40,358
This is not happening.. this is not happening.
I taste sour in my mouth.

191
00:24:40,465 --> 00:24:44,097
Take it easy, Dave. Deep breaths.

192
00:24:47,414 --> 00:24:49,767
What?

193
00:24:49,871 --> 00:24:51,871
Now, that is not happening ..

194
00:24:51,921 --> 00:24:54,448
What's wrong?
What is it?

195
00:24:54,553 --> 00:24:58,765
No, no, no, no, no.
You are not doing this to me again.

196
00:24:58,873 --> 00:25:02,511
Do you have any idea what my life
has been like for the last ten year?

197
00:25:02,617 --> 00:25:05,335
I've been stuck in an urn for the last ten years

198
00:25:05,441 --> 00:25:10,507
So have I...
A figurative urn of ridicule!

199
00:25:10,616 --> 00:25:13,591
Do you know that in certain parts
of the tri-state area ...

200
00:25:13,697 --> 00:25:19,393
they still refer to having a nervous breakdown as pulling
a 'David Stutler'? Did you know that?!

201
00:25:19,503 --> 00:25:21,792
Try to be a good listener, Dave.

202
00:25:21,896 --> 00:25:25,154
That doll is called the Grim Hold.
It is a prison...

203
00:25:25,260 --> 00:25:28,559
for the most dangerous Morganians
in history.

204
00:25:28,665 --> 00:25:31,874
Each one locked up in a layer of the doll

205
00:25:31,980 --> 00:25:37,760
Horvath wants to free his fellow Morganians,
and destroy the world.

206
00:25:37,871 --> 00:25:43,205
This must not happen.

207
00:25:43,315 --> 00:25:46,436
Yeah, for sure.

208
00:25:47,878 --> 00:25:52,668
The truth is, you have a
very special gift

209
00:25:52,777 --> 00:25:57,639
- You need to see that
- I just wanna be normal.

210
00:25:57,748 --> 00:26:01,811
.. Normal life. I wanna forget about
that day at Arcana Cabana.

211
00:26:01,918 --> 00:26:07,542
I wanna forget about magic.
I wanna forget everything.

212
00:26:08,563 --> 00:26:11,890
- You should duck.
- What?

213
00:26:13,452 --> 00:26:20,069
You wanna forget magic?
Then why'd you keep the ring?

214
00:26:20,581 --> 00:26:25,000
I.... I was going to
sell that on Ebay.

215
00:26:25,108 --> 00:26:26,805
You're still a bad liar, Dave.

216
00:26:26,908 --> 00:26:30,589
I like that about you. It's a good sign.
You have the gift.

217
00:26:30,697 --> 00:26:32,941
No, I have a life.

218
00:26:33,044 --> 00:26:35,265
You're the last person
Horvath saw with the Grim Hold.

219
00:26:35,369 --> 00:26:36,709
That puts you on his list.

220
00:26:36,812 --> 00:26:40,053
So unless you want him to turn you
into a pig,... who just loves physics,

221
00:26:40,159 --> 00:26:42,721
Then you better help me
find that doll before he does.

222
00:26:42,825 --> 00:26:46,894
Ah, God. This is crazy.
You see how crazy this is, right?

223
00:26:47,003 --> 00:26:54,148
Alright. Alright. You help me
get it back, you're done.

224
00:26:54,261 --> 00:26:57,768
- Really?
- You can walk away.

225
00:27:00,775 --> 00:27:03,960
Can you please put my dresser back?

226
00:27:07,604 --> 00:27:13,926
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.. what are you doing?
Oh No. Please, don't do that. What are you doing?

227
00:27:16,156 --> 00:27:18,375
What? Whoa, what is that?

228
00:27:18,479 --> 00:27:20,310
It's my Grim Hold tracking device.

229
00:27:20,414 --> 00:27:23,984
Biometric pressure spell that displaces
the atmosphere above the doll.

230
00:27:24,090 --> 00:27:25,677
It looks like downtown.

231
00:27:25,780 --> 00:27:27,974
If we can track the Grim Hold,
so can Horvath

232
00:27:28,078 --> 00:27:29,603
So why don't we just take the eagle?

233
00:27:29,706 --> 00:27:33,212
Too hot profile for a trip downtown

234
00:27:33,925 --> 00:27:36,195
- I'll have to call a tow.
- That won't be necessary.

235
00:27:36,299 --> 00:27:40,615
Yeah, but this car has been
impounded for like ten years.

236
00:27:41,420 --> 00:27:44,771
Yeah, this is low profile.

237
00:27:46,133 --> 00:27:49,353
<b>She missed me.</b>

238
00:27:51,839 --> 00:27:56,417
Let me give you the basics. Strictly Sorcery 101.
Put on the ring.

239
00:27:56,525 --> 00:27:59,922
- Nothing's going to happen.
- Yeah?

240
00:28:00,044 --> 00:28:02,044
Oh, no.

241
00:28:03,583 --> 00:28:04,663
Kidding.

242
00:28:04,765 --> 00:28:07,350
Have you heard that people use only 10%
of their brains?

243
00:28:07,456 --> 00:28:09,139
Sorcerers can manipulate matter...

244
00:28:09,242 --> 00:28:12,449
because they're born with the capability
to use the entire power of their brains.

245
00:28:12,555 --> 00:28:15,901
Which also explains why molecular
physics comes so easily to you.

246
00:28:16,006 --> 00:28:18,638
So wait... Is sorcery
science or magic?

247
00:28:18,744 --> 00:28:19,997
Yes and yes.

248
00:28:20,099 --> 00:28:23,762
For now all you need is a
basic-combat-spell. Making Fire.

249
00:28:23,869 --> 00:28:26,739
- What causes molecules to heat up?
- They vibrate?

250
00:28:26,845 --> 00:28:30,910
Everything we see is in a constant state of
vibration. That's the illusion of solidity.

251
00:28:31,017 --> 00:28:34,418
But how do we take that which appears solid
and have it burst into flames?

252
00:28:34,524 --> 00:28:38,676
Clear your mind ..

253
00:28:38,783 --> 00:28:44,496
- See the molecules.
- Make them shake.

254
00:28:44,785 --> 00:28:47,451
- Got it?
- No, I definitely don't got it.

255
00:28:47,555 --> 00:28:50,391
Trust the ring, Dave.
And keep it so.

256
00:28:50,497 --> 00:28:54,503
Civilians mustn't know magic exists.
That would be complicated.

257
00:28:54,610 --> 00:28:59,706
...Says the guy in the 350-year old
rawhide trench coat.

258
00:29:05,164 --> 00:29:08,138
I threw it in the street.

259
00:29:08,648 --> 00:29:10,729
It's been a long time ago.
I actually don't know where it is.

260
00:29:10,834 --> 00:29:13,531
I threw it in the street.

261
00:29:13,635 --> 00:29:16,715
- Don't go in there ..
- He peed in his pants.

262
00:29:16,821 --> 00:29:19,662
The shop is on fire. Do not go
inside. These guys are...

263
00:29:19,768 --> 00:29:23,003
It's just water.
There was a fire.

264
00:29:23,562 --> 00:29:27,787
- I threw it in the street.
- But where?

265
00:29:37,732 --> 00:29:40,030
Get away, freak!
I need to pull in there.

266
00:29:40,134 --> 00:29:44,514
- Are you addressing me?
- Hey! Don't mess with me.

267
00:29:46,596 --> 00:29:49,384
Where was I?

268
00:29:49,489 --> 00:29:52,557
Chinatown.

269
00:30:09,230 --> 00:30:13,901
You stay there. I'll get the Grim Hold.
Keep an eye up for Horvath.

270
00:30:20,592 --> 00:30:22,592
Hi.

271
00:30:46,444 --> 00:30:50,133
Can I help you?
Do you have an appointment?

272
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:55,080
I'm sorry to trouble you. I'm looking for a...
Well, it's rather strange .. A nesting doll.

273
00:30:55,189 --> 00:30:58,802
It's about this big. Angry looking
Chinese gentleman on the front.

274
00:30:58,909 --> 00:31:00,653
- A nesting doll?
- Yes.

275
00:31:00,756 --> 00:31:06,377
- It's possible. I collect so many objects
- Tao fa ho long.

276
00:31:06,487 --> 00:31:11,508
Ah, you speak Mandarin.

277
00:31:15,436 --> 00:31:18,708
That was Cantonese, Horvath.

278
00:31:18,813 --> 00:31:20,628
The Grim Hold. Where is it?

279
00:31:20,733 --> 00:31:23,693
An old associate of mine speaks
impeccable Cantonese.

280
00:31:23,797 --> 00:31:25,955
He lived about 200 years ago.

281
00:31:26,060 --> 00:31:34,054
Do you know him? Sun-Lok. Of course you do.
You locked him inside the Grim Hold.

282
00:31:35,975 --> 00:31:39,152
Opened it.

283
00:31:45,584 --> 00:31:50,969
Are you alright?
What, Oh... What the ..?

284
00:31:52,108 --> 00:31:56,865
- Hey, I'm like one of them.
- Dave. You should run.

285
00:32:13,649 --> 00:32:17,870
What is wrong? Why is it so heavy?
This thing is heavy.

286
00:32:19,770 --> 00:32:23,464
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

287
00:32:54,296 --> 00:32:57,498
Be still.

288
00:33:13,865 --> 00:33:16,652
Balthazar.

289
00:33:21,938 --> 00:33:24,656
Come on

290
00:33:25,744 --> 00:33:28,478
You skipped the first step.
Clear your mind!

291
00:33:28,583 --> 00:33:31,823
Get the first step.

292
00:33:34,822 --> 00:33:38,591
Clear my mind?
Are you insane?

293
00:33:39,220 --> 00:33:42,247
A little bit.

294
00:33:52,347 --> 00:33:54,984
Oh, man.

295
00:34:01,298 --> 00:34:07,194
This is it.
Clear your mind. Believe.

296
00:34:30,589 --> 00:34:35,087
Yeah. Oh, go team.
Magical stuff.

297
00:34:43,687 --> 00:34:47,696
Did you see that? Did you see what I did?
I did it.

298
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:51,709
I stood on the balcony.

299
00:34:51,814 --> 00:34:56,420
- It can't be.
- Thanks, man.

300
00:34:59,212 --> 00:35:01,946
Unbelievable.

301
00:35:03,928 --> 00:35:05,738
Hey, what do you got?
Did you see what happened here?

302
00:35:05,842 --> 00:35:07,402
You know what?

303
00:35:07,505 --> 00:35:12,307
One rocket hits this paper dragon in this Asian festival
and lit it up like a birthday cake

304
00:35:12,415 --> 00:35:15,944
We get some muffled call
saying it was a real dragon.

305
00:35:16,050 --> 00:35:20,272
Between you and me, cap'n, I think some of
these folks were hitting the sake pretty hard.

306
00:35:20,381 --> 00:35:23,735
Sake is Japanese. actually ..

307
00:35:26,855 --> 00:35:29,711
Carry on.

308
00:35:30,029 --> 00:35:32,640
- Sake is Japanese?
- Well, it is

309
00:35:32,746 --> 00:35:36,226
- I was in character
- Oh, right

310
00:35:40,539 --> 00:35:44,027
You may now return the ring to me.

311
00:35:44,383 --> 00:35:47,289
I'm a man of my word.
You helped me. We're done.

312
00:35:47,394 --> 00:35:50,304
Right.. right

313
00:35:53,996 --> 00:35:57,213
I'd like to wear it some more.

314
00:35:58,034 --> 00:36:02,979
We need a place to work.
Somewhere under Horvath's radar.

315
00:36:03,088 --> 00:36:06,317
I think I can help with that.

316
00:36:12,582 --> 00:36:16,381
This was originally a subway turnaround

317
00:36:16,488 --> 00:36:22,227
They let me work down here because some
of my experiments can be a bit dangerous.

318
00:36:22,337 --> 00:36:27,842
Oh, my professor has a hook up
so nobody knows we're down here.

319
00:36:28,402 --> 00:36:32,811
I didn't have the chance
to give you this before.

320
00:36:32,919 --> 00:36:35,976
Your Incantus.

321
00:36:36,297 --> 00:36:38,399
I remember it being bigger.

322
00:36:38,503 --> 00:36:40,380
Pocket edition.

323
00:36:40,484 --> 00:36:48,574
The Incantus is our textbook. The art,
science and history of sorcery

324
00:36:48,688 --> 00:36:52,193
Including our recent history as well.

325
00:36:53,560 --> 00:36:56,020
Come on.

326
00:36:56,124 --> 00:36:59,863
See? There you are.

327
00:37:01,896 --> 00:37:04,612
Before we can put Horvath
back inside the Grim Hold

328
00:37:04,716 --> 00:37:07,922
We must first turn you into a sorcerer ..

329
00:37:08,028 --> 00:37:11,826
Which begins now.
Step back.

330
00:37:12,593 --> 00:37:14,297
- I really was doing something...
- Eyes open.

331
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:17,862
- Yes.
- Mouth closed.

332
00:37:48,985 --> 00:37:51,143
This is the Merlin Circle.

333
00:37:51,247 --> 00:37:56,414
It focuses your energy.
Helps you master new spells.

334
00:37:56,524 --> 00:37:59,805
It is where you will learn the art.

335
00:37:59,955 --> 00:38:04,236
Step inside,
you leave everything else behind.

336
00:38:04,612 --> 00:38:11,116
Once you enter,
there is no going back.

337
00:38:13,020 --> 00:38:16,076
So I should probably pee first?

338
00:38:16,182 --> 00:38:19,246
Better safe than...

339
00:38:20,137 --> 00:38:23,157
I can hold it.

340
00:38:27,107 --> 00:38:33,320
I'm Balthazar Blake, sorcerer of the
777th degree,

341
00:38:33,432 --> 00:38:36,847
and you are my apprentice.

342
00:38:37,972 --> 00:38:39,815
Sweet

343
00:38:39,918 --> 00:38:42,550
Your ring is not a piece of jewelery.

344
00:38:42,656 --> 00:38:48,107
It projects the electrical energy of
your nervous system into the physical world.

345
00:38:48,216 --> 00:38:51,127
Without his ring, a sorcerer
is powerless.

346
00:38:51,233 --> 00:38:54,381
The only other thing a sorcerer
needs ...

347
00:38:54,487 --> 00:38:57,472
.. is a nice pair of pointy shoes.

348
00:38:57,578 --> 00:38:59,993
Your rubber soles block the current

349
00:39:00,097 --> 00:39:01,956
Plus it helps look classy.

350
00:39:02,059 --> 00:39:05,351
These are old men shoes.

351
00:39:07,413 --> 00:39:08,886
Excuse me?

352
00:39:08,989 --> 00:39:11,804
I love them.

353
00:39:11,910 --> 00:39:14,754
A lot

354
00:39:29,793 --> 00:39:35,028
I haven't seen that cane since...
I saw a picture of it when I was a boy.

355
00:39:35,137 --> 00:39:38,143
- You've been locked up a long time.
- And now I'm out.

356
00:39:38,249 --> 00:39:42,932
- And I need soldiers.
- I got one kid

357
00:39:43,160 --> 00:39:46,836
- He ain't old school
- One will do

358
00:39:46,949 --> 00:39:52,437
Your ingenuity and your heart, will give you an
advantage over Morganians.

359
00:39:52,547 --> 00:39:56,098
They rely only on the power of
their magic.

360
00:39:56,204 --> 00:40:00,650
But if you're up against the wall,
there's only one weapon of choice

361
00:40:00,758 --> 00:40:03,890
The plasma ball.

362
00:40:10,314 --> 00:40:13,101
Yeah, nothing. There's nothing, nothing.

363
00:40:13,207 --> 00:40:17,351
I got it.
I got one.

364
00:40:17,794 --> 00:40:20,837
Underwhelming.

365
00:40:20,943 --> 00:40:23,182
God.

366
00:40:23,285 --> 00:40:26,076
Again.

367
00:40:32,650 --> 00:40:36,289
...And invite my soul...
And again.

368
00:40:37,212 --> 00:40:40,710
See? That's what
pad is...

369
00:40:47,351 --> 00:40:51,636
So I'll have a bath from the jewels then I'm gonna
emerge, right? And everyone's gonna think I'm dead.

370
00:40:51,744 --> 00:40:55,164
I'll reach into the big top hat
and I'll pull myself out,

371
00:40:55,271 --> 00:40:56,914
but I'm a woman.

372
00:40:57,017 --> 00:41:01,177
A ball of fire, right. A baby sitting in a napkin
but I would like a tiger.

373
00:41:01,284 --> 00:41:05,096
If I could get like a tiger jump a leopard.

374
00:41:05,203 --> 00:41:08,504
<i>But not at his mouth, that's been done, I'm sure.
somewhere..</i>

375
00:41:08,610 --> 00:41:15,735
Good. Just perfect, doll.
Yeah, yeah, keep it straight up, sister.

376
00:41:15,848 --> 00:41:19,400
Oh, do tell me this is a joke.

377
00:41:19,719 --> 00:41:21,200
Sorry, are you lost?

378
00:41:21,303 --> 00:41:26,257
So, you are what passes for
a Morganian these days?

379
00:41:26,984 --> 00:41:31,837
- Maxine Horvath. You are one smanky man...
- Will you excuse us, ladies?

380
00:41:31,945 --> 00:41:34,903
Yes, excuse us, ladies.

381
00:41:35,009 --> 00:41:38,378
- Bob, you too.
- Bob...

382
00:41:38,484 --> 00:41:39,555
Sorry.

383
00:41:39,657 --> 00:41:45,375
So they tell me you're some kind of
...entertainer.

384
00:41:45,486 --> 00:41:47,370
Five sold out shows at
the Garden plus...

385
00:41:47,473 --> 00:41:50,551
back end
on a pay per view.

386
00:41:50,657 --> 00:41:53,734
Did you ever see Morgana
pull a rabbit out of a hat?

387
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:56,849
Look, my master disappeared when I was fifteen.
Vanished.

388
00:41:56,955 --> 00:41:58,955
Left me with nothing but an Incantus...

389
00:41:59,013 --> 00:42:01,593
and some prescription guide for vandalment issues.

390
00:42:01,698 --> 00:42:06,635
- So I improvised.
- Well, the time for improvisation is over.

391
00:42:07,699 --> 00:42:11,122
Balthazar Blake may have found
the Prime Merlinian.

392
00:42:11,228 --> 00:42:14,344
He wears the ring?

393
00:42:16,421 --> 00:42:20,040
The best way to
to defend against fire...

394
00:42:21,211 --> 00:42:24,284
a vacuum ball.

395
00:42:24,616 --> 00:42:27,532
Your turn.

396
00:42:30,073 --> 00:42:34,332
- I did it. I did it.
- Excellent. Excellent.

397
00:42:34,441 --> 00:42:37,403
- Excellent
- I did that.

398
00:42:38,610 --> 00:42:40,345
What's wrong with your
Tesla coil?

399
00:42:40,348 --> 00:42:42,348
It seems to be firing on its own.

400
00:42:46,268 --> 00:42:49,910
- Really .. really funny.
- This will be hilarious then.

401
00:42:50,017 --> 00:42:52,751
Oh, my God.

402
00:42:56,190 --> 00:42:59,279
- Dude.
- I think it's fair enough.

403
00:42:59,385 --> 00:43:03,357
- I haven't eaten in ten years.
- Yeah, yeah, fair enough.

404
00:43:03,464 --> 00:43:06,751
May I ask what's so special about this bench?

405
00:43:10,210 --> 00:43:11,830
- No, no. No.
- What?

406
00:43:11,933 --> 00:43:13,961
There's no time for that
and too much at stake.

407
00:43:14,065 --> 00:43:20,961
That girl, she's the one, man.
And you're my mentor, Balthazar.

408
00:43:21,073 --> 00:43:25,239
Aren't you supposed to help me achieve
my personal goals?

409
00:43:25,348 --> 00:43:29,530
Ahh.. yes, yes. Except I'm not your mentor.
I'm your master.

410
00:43:29,637 --> 00:43:34,671
If Horvath catches
you out in the street, you'll die.

411
00:43:34,780 --> 00:43:39,188
Is she worth that?
Think about it, Dave.

412
00:43:44,148 --> 00:43:46,662
Don't eat my sandwich.

413
00:43:46,766 --> 00:43:49,656
Becky. What a coincidence.

414
00:43:49,762 --> 00:43:52,346
- Oh. Hi, Dave.
- Going uptown, or...

415
00:43:52,450 --> 00:43:55,428
- Are you stalking me?
- Not in a threatening way.

416
00:43:55,534 --> 00:43:58,308
Why was I even concerned?

417
00:43:58,413 --> 00:44:00,421
So I listened to your show last night.

418
00:44:00,525 --> 00:44:02,561
- Oh, what do you think?
- I would say it was amazing.

419
00:44:02,664 --> 00:44:07,320
I've never actually heard of any of those bands
which I think is a good indicator that they're cool.

420
00:44:08,051 --> 00:44:10,060
I'm glad someone was listening.

421
00:44:10,164 --> 00:44:14,454
This may come as a surprise to you
I don't get up too much.

422
00:44:15,340 --> 00:44:19,216
Give me that. Come on. Come on
Give me the bracelet.

423
00:44:21,765 --> 00:44:25,348
That was my grandmother's bracelet.

424
00:44:26,268 --> 00:44:29,366
No.
Dave, don't!

425
00:44:38,997 --> 00:44:41,950
Can you just give me that bracelet back, please?

426
00:44:42,056 --> 00:44:44,518
You better run back to your girlfriend.

427
00:44:44,622 --> 00:44:49,009
Believe me, I wish she was...
You thought she was my girlfriend?

428
00:44:49,118 --> 00:44:51,609
Really?
Is that the kind of idea you got?

429
00:44:51,713 --> 00:44:55,015
You talk too much.
Shut up.

430
00:44:56,915 --> 00:44:58,560
What are you doing?

431
00:44:58,663 --> 00:45:02,623
I have no idea what you're referring to.
I honestly...

432
00:45:04,696 --> 00:45:07,441
- Oh, you seeing it?
- Heads up

433
00:45:13,232 --> 00:45:15,596
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, here you go

434
00:45:15,701 --> 00:45:19,190
- Your grandmother's bracelet.
- How did you do that?

435
00:45:19,297 --> 00:45:25,182
- That guy was huge
- I've been doing a lot of cardio.. cardio boxing lately ..

436
00:45:25,292 --> 00:45:29,472
Let me introduce Thunder, Lightning.

437
00:45:31,396 --> 00:45:34,536
Something about you seems different.

438
00:45:34,652 --> 00:45:37,929
I am wearing new shoes.

439
00:45:38,522 --> 00:45:41,163
- Nice.
- Thank you, is that your train?

440
00:45:41,268 --> 00:45:44,402
Yes. Thank you.

441
00:45:44,508 --> 00:45:48,924
Alright, I just want to tell you that if you
want me to help you with your mid-terms

442
00:45:49,032 --> 00:45:52,700
- You come by my lab. I'll text you the address.
- Yes. That'll be great.

443
00:45:52,807 --> 00:45:54,678
- Yeah?
- Ah, tomorrow?

444
00:45:54,781 --> 00:45:57,200
It's a date

445
00:45:57,305 --> 00:46:01,244
No, no .. it's not a date.
It's a date ... like an appointment,

446
00:46:01,352 --> 00:46:05,313
It's a date, no ..date like an appointment.

447
00:46:12,030 --> 00:46:19,075
Love .. is a distraction.
Sorcery requires complete focus

448
00:46:19,304 --> 00:46:23,823
Let's go, Thunder and Lightning.
There's more to learn.

449
00:46:26,732 --> 00:46:28,778
This is perfect.

450
00:46:28,881 --> 00:46:31,300
The Rising will happen here.

451
00:46:31,406 --> 00:46:40,568
We will use these satellite dishes on the rooftops.
There and there and there.

452
00:46:40,804 --> 00:46:41,798
Get it done

453
00:46:41,900 --> 00:46:45,721
'My Best of' DVD
drops next month.

454
00:46:45,828 --> 00:46:49,079
There you go. Alright.
Move.

455
00:46:50,206 --> 00:46:54,876
Sorry, but it's just nice for them
to see a genuine icon like me.

456
00:46:54,985 --> 00:46:57,877
Fortunately, they will be dead soon.

457
00:46:57,982 --> 00:47:00,719
But before that...
we need to find the boy.

458
00:47:00,825 --> 00:47:03,931
Well, how do we do that?

459
00:47:04,303 --> 00:47:07,526
We'll wait until he's alone.

460
00:47:09,784 --> 00:47:14,392
Now focus on control
Set me down slow and steady.

461
00:47:17,871 --> 00:47:20,758
Dave? It's Becky.

462
00:47:20,863 --> 00:47:22,659
Probably back shortly.

463
00:47:22,763 --> 00:47:25,221
Could you please hide?
Hide now, please.

464
00:47:25,325 --> 00:47:28,237
Dave, get back here.
We have important work to do.

465
00:47:28,343 --> 00:47:31,932
- Knock, knock.
- Yeah, Becky... Just a...

466
00:47:32,979 --> 00:47:37,442
- We should go. The library, anyplace.
- Dave?

467
00:47:37,550 --> 00:47:40,612
- Is that company I hear?
- Yeah.

468
00:47:40,718 --> 00:47:44,920
Umm. Okay. Fine, Becky, this is my...

469
00:47:45,028 --> 00:47:48,743
- Uncle. Uncle Balthazar.
- Dave, I'm confused.

470
00:47:48,850 --> 00:47:50,963
I thought you and I were staying in together.

471
00:47:51,067 --> 00:47:54,192
- Aww. If this is a bad time, I could come back... - No, no ..
- Actually.

472
00:47:54,298 --> 00:47:59,343
- No. No. Uncle, you and I
have plans for later on.

473
00:47:59,452 --> 00:48:01,477
- Becky, let's just get out of here.
- You know what?

474
00:48:01,581 --> 00:48:06,122
It's alright, because I just remembered I have
to go into town to pick up your anti-itch gram

475
00:48:06,230 --> 00:48:10,480
So you two stay here.
Pleasure to meet you.

476
00:48:57,351 --> 00:49:00,749
OK, enough with the studying.
There is something I wanna show you

477
00:49:00,856 --> 00:49:03,526
- What are these things?
- Tesla coils

478
00:49:03,630 --> 00:49:07,630
I was using them to generate something
called plasma.

479
00:49:07,738 --> 00:49:13,517
The thing is, I got so fixated on
the technical aspects of it that...

480
00:49:13,627 --> 00:49:19,473
I almost didn't notice something
kind of a ... beautiful

481
00:49:21,146 --> 00:49:23,971
I think you better
step into my cage.

482
00:49:24,077 --> 00:49:27,978
OK. It's definitely the first time
anyone has said that to me.

483
00:49:28,085 --> 00:49:30,662
I'm not surprised.

484
00:49:30,767 --> 00:49:33,457
Just hold on to this bar, please.

485
00:49:33,562 --> 00:49:38,363
With both hands.
Yep, OK.

486
00:49:42,854 --> 00:49:48,315
OK. Hold on tight
and enjoy the show.

487
00:49:52,786 --> 00:49:58,012
Oh, my god.
How is this possible?

488
00:49:58,122 --> 00:50:00,709
Ahm, the coils are firing at such a high frequency

489
00:50:00,814 --> 00:50:07,486
that the sparks literally create sound waves
as they fly through the air... which is .. nerdy!

490
00:50:21,834 --> 00:50:25,504
You were listening.
I played this song the other night.

491
00:50:25,611 --> 00:50:28,743
These coils are my life.

492
00:50:28,849 --> 00:50:31,268
Two years I'm down here working with them...

493
00:50:31,372 --> 00:50:34,372
and they're making their own music
and it was lost on me...

494
00:50:34,478 --> 00:50:38,293
I was never able
to appreciate it...

495
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:44,107
until I met you and heard you talk
about music on your radio show...

496
00:50:44,688 --> 00:50:48,210
aww... I'm just happy

497
00:51:12,537 --> 00:51:13,881
Alright, this is me.

498
00:51:13,983 --> 00:51:18,023
So you want to read up later?
Eight o'clock. my lab?

499
00:51:18,130 --> 00:51:20,236
Yeah, that'll be great.

500
00:51:20,340 --> 00:51:23,523
- With me?
- With you, yes.

501
00:51:23,629 --> 00:51:25,737
- Just making sure...
- I got yoga.

502
00:51:25,841 --> 00:51:28,963
Yeah, I gotta go to the bathroom.

503
00:51:29,069 --> 00:51:34,777
<i>I got a date with a girl
because I'm awesome...</i>

504
00:51:35,746 --> 00:51:39,197
- So you're the one?
- Excuse me?

505
00:51:39,715 --> 00:51:43,807
Prime Merlinian, eh?
You don't look like much

506
00:51:44,029 --> 00:51:46,501
I don't actually know what you're talking about.

507
00:51:46,606 --> 00:51:49,852
Good. Makes this easy.

508
00:51:53,042 --> 00:51:55,946
Don't have anyone to hear
you with your girly cries, huh?

509
00:51:56,052 --> 00:51:59,156
I don't actually know who you are.

510
00:51:59,261 --> 00:52:01,625
Really? You don't recognize me?

511
00:52:01,730 --> 00:52:04,024
Are you in Depeche Mode?

512
00:52:04,128 --> 00:52:06,832
What? what ... Arrgh ..

513
00:52:08,205 --> 00:52:10,346
What do you weigh like?
About twenty?

514
00:52:10,451 --> 00:52:14,934
What the...?
Is this high school over again?

515
00:52:15,660 --> 00:52:17,432
Alright, l tell you what.

516
00:52:17,536 --> 00:52:20,315
Hit me with your best shot.
Your most powerful spell.

517
00:52:20,419 --> 00:52:22,930
- OK.
- Get the ring at. Put it on

518
00:52:23,035 --> 00:52:25,772
Good boy.

519
00:52:28,539 --> 00:52:31,067
- No, I'm joking.
- Nothing has happened.

520
00:52:31,171 --> 00:52:33,062
- Have you cleared your mind?
- Yeah, pretty sure.

521
00:52:33,167 --> 00:52:36,875
It is the pressure. The ring is on.
Take the ring off.

522
00:52:36,982 --> 00:52:40,421
- That might help.
- Enough, you Idiot.

523
00:52:40,527 --> 00:52:43,594
Watch the door.

524
00:52:45,748 --> 00:52:48,121
You...

525
00:52:49,868 --> 00:52:52,583
Oh, no.

526
00:52:53,188 --> 00:52:56,052
- Hello, Dave.
- Hi.

527
00:52:56,667 --> 00:52:59,634
So, Dave...

528
00:53:00,961 --> 00:53:05,586
I'm going to kill you. right here
In this dismal bathroom

529
00:53:05,695 --> 00:53:08,483
It's not very classy
but there you go.

530
00:53:08,588 --> 00:53:13,773
Before we get to that unpleasantness,
you're going to tell me where the Grim Hold is.

531
00:53:14,024 --> 00:53:16,297
Where is she?

532
00:53:16,401 --> 00:53:17,905
She?

533
00:53:18,008 --> 00:53:22,422
Oh, he hasn't tell you, has he?

534
00:53:22,542 --> 00:53:26,360
The truth about who is inside the doll.

535
00:53:26,466 --> 00:53:32,109
Oh, sweetheart,
You've put your faith on the wrong man.

536
00:53:33,069 --> 00:53:38,067
Tell me, have you ever been in love?

537
00:53:38,176 --> 00:53:40,176
- I...
- Yeah, you're in love right now!

538
00:53:40,276 --> 00:53:44,484
I can see it in your eyes.
No, no, don't deny it.

539
00:53:44,978 --> 00:53:50,425
I wonder what would happen
if you lost her?

540
00:53:50,536 --> 00:53:53,420
- I...
- Shut up.

541
00:53:55,461 --> 00:53:59,297
You'd be no better than the rest of us.

542
00:54:05,357 --> 00:54:08,397
Where's the Grim Hold?

543
00:54:09,415 --> 00:54:13,502
- I don't know.
- Dave, you really are the most dreadful liar.

544
00:54:13,610 --> 00:54:15,931
That's what I keep telling him

545
00:54:16,035 --> 00:54:19,156
Want your guy back?

546
00:54:24,219 --> 00:54:28,817
It's been awhile since I've seen the
Hungarian miracle.

547
00:54:31,599 --> 00:54:34,884
I guess I'm just old fashioned.

548
00:54:38,411 --> 00:54:41,294
Balthazar, watch out.

549
00:54:45,781 --> 00:54:48,781
What are you doing here, Dave?

550
00:54:48,887 --> 00:54:50,595
Horvath was trying to kill me.

551
00:54:50,698 --> 00:54:52,815
His moral compass
doesn't exactly point north.

552
00:54:52,919 --> 00:54:55,230
Yeah, and what about yours? huh?

553
00:54:55,335 --> 00:54:58,508
You haven't been completely truthful with me.

554
00:54:58,613 --> 00:55:02,885
That guy called me the Prime Merlinian.
Balthazar, what is that?

555
00:55:02,993 --> 00:55:09,567
Now, I' [m not doing anything else until you start
being truthful with me about what's going on.

556
00:55:10,918 --> 00:55:14,120
Who is in that Grim Hold?

557
00:55:14,597 --> 00:55:17,407
Morgana.

558
00:55:22,837 --> 00:55:27,788
Wake up that moron in stall number three for me,
would you?

559
00:55:31,741 --> 00:55:34,498
For heaven's sake

560
00:55:34,816 --> 00:55:40,700
Morgana, she was making preparations for
the Rising,

561
00:55:40,811 --> 00:55:43,303
Something that will enable her to enslave mankind ..

562
00:55:43,408 --> 00:55:46,767
by resurrecting dead Morganian sorcerers.

563
00:55:46,873 --> 00:55:48,944
So after the witch girl,
there's another doll...

564
00:55:49,048 --> 00:55:51,531
that contains the greatest evil
the world has ever known?

565
00:55:51,636 --> 00:55:52,913
She's in the last doll.

566
00:55:53,015 --> 00:55:59,532
And what would it have to do
with this .. er .. Prime Merlinian?

567
00:55:59,644 --> 00:56:03,697
Merlin had three apprentices,
I was one of them.

568
00:56:04,377 --> 00:56:06,932
You are Merlin's apprentice?

569
00:56:07,036 --> 00:56:10,212
He cast a spell that keep us from aging
until we found the sorcerer...

570
00:56:10,318 --> 00:56:16,309
who would inherit his power...
and his dragon ring..

571
00:56:18,332 --> 00:56:25,440
Some part of you, no matter how small,
must share the same blood.

572
00:56:25,553 --> 00:56:27,600
As Merlin?

573
00:56:27,704 --> 00:56:32,032
Great men have always been called.
This is your calling.

574
00:56:32,869 --> 00:56:34,413
Merlin said:

575
00:56:34,516 --> 00:56:41,593
"The only one who'll ever be able to
destroy Morgana once and for all is the Prime Merlinian."

576
00:56:41,851 --> 00:56:45,829
So I'm supposed to save the world?

577
00:56:45,936 --> 00:56:50,074
I.. I just don't think I'm up for that.

578
00:56:50,182 --> 00:56:55,119
You think I've been teaching you magic tricks
for some little girl 's tea party?

579
00:56:55,558 --> 00:56:59,735
When you stepped inside this circle,
I told you there was no going back.

580
00:56:59,842 --> 00:57:02,385
You took an oath.

581
00:57:02,490 --> 00:57:05,950
I've searching a thousand years for you.

582
00:57:06,057 --> 00:57:08,608
Fighting Morganians ..
protecting the Grim Hold.

583
00:57:08,712 --> 00:57:11,003
You're going to set me free

584
00:57:11,108 --> 00:57:16,592
You have to become the Prime Merlinian,
and I am not asking.

585
00:57:24,080 --> 00:57:27,659
I have a student who is failing my class.
I need his file.

586
00:57:27,765 --> 00:57:32,128
First, I'll need to see your faculty identification card

587
00:57:32,766 --> 00:57:38,646
You don't need to see my faculty identification card

588
00:57:40,803 --> 00:57:44,525
I don't need your faculty identification card

589
00:57:44,631 --> 00:57:48,082
These are not the Droids
you're looking for.

590
00:57:53,166 --> 00:57:57,989
Here it is.
He has an unauthorized lab space.

591
00:57:59,701 --> 00:58:07,048
OK, so how do I know
when I'm it... the Prime Merlinian?

592
00:58:07,162 --> 00:58:11,181
The Prime Merlinian will become so powerful within,

593
00:58:11,288 --> 00:58:13,946
He no longer needs his ring to cast magic.

594
00:58:14,051 --> 00:58:19,285
When you can do that,
you're ready to take on Morgana.

595
00:58:19,395 --> 00:58:23,436
Hey. What is he doing here anyway?

596
00:58:24,210 --> 00:58:27,360
This should be good

597
00:58:27,606 --> 00:58:30,307
Schematic for a fusion spell.

598
00:58:30,413 --> 00:58:33,705
The merging of two souls
into one physical body.

599
00:58:33,811 --> 00:58:38,599
I've only ever seen one sorcerer successfully
pull up human fusion.

600
00:58:38,708 --> 00:58:42,338
- And Tank is here for...
- Practice.

601
00:58:42,444 --> 00:58:45,872
Are you telling me you're trying to possess Tank?

602
00:58:50,499 --> 00:58:54,016
Yeah, I'm so sure it's the best idea either.

603
00:58:54,123 --> 00:58:56,569
No.

604
00:58:58,594 --> 00:59:06,727
No, man .. Becky is coming now and I'm standing in a puddle.
I need to stop and clean.

605
00:59:06,842 --> 00:59:09,323
We're not done training

606
00:59:09,428 --> 00:59:14,566
Balthazar, I've been waiting ten years
to see this girl again

607
00:59:14,675 --> 00:59:18,344
Do you have any idea what's that like?

608
00:59:19,027 --> 00:59:22,746
When I come back
you better be focused.

609
00:59:29,110 --> 00:59:32,225
This is really sticky.

610
00:59:33,286 --> 00:59:36,230
I'm doomed.

611
00:59:36,335 --> 00:59:38,656
This...

612
00:59:41,097 --> 00:59:44,051
Thank you.

613
01:01:12,044 --> 01:01:15,331
I command you to stop.

614
01:01:16,775 --> 01:01:18,646
Stop.

615
01:01:18,750 --> 01:01:21,829
Oh, man.

616
01:01:48,048 --> 01:01:50,048
Becky.

617
01:01:51,139 --> 01:01:53,402
- Hi
- You're on time.

618
01:01:53,506 --> 01:01:57,604
- You forgot, huh?
- No, I didn't forget.

619
01:01:57,712 --> 01:02:01,048
- Is everything okay?
- Me? How are you doing?

620
01:02:01,154 --> 01:02:05,421
- I am good.
- Would you please stop that?

621
01:02:05,528 --> 01:02:08,512
Would you...

622
01:02:09,554 --> 01:02:13,994
It is probably the best for you to leave.
My God, what am I saying?

623
01:02:14,102 --> 01:02:16,600
OK, OK .. I'll go.

624
01:02:16,705 --> 01:02:20,124
Yes, I'm sorry.
I'm having issues

625
01:02:26,776 --> 01:02:29,817
My coils ..

626
01:02:41,199 --> 01:02:44,339
Disperse..

627
01:02:54,026 --> 01:02:56,976
You have abused the sacred art...

628
01:02:57,082 --> 01:03:00,887
and you have abused the Merlin Circle.
Magic isn't a game.

629
01:03:00,994 --> 01:03:02,747
No shortcuts.

630
01:03:02,850 --> 01:03:07,086
Pooling in that water, and getting electrocuted,
That's how a sorcerer loses his power.

631
01:03:07,193 --> 01:03:09,193
What rule is that?

632
01:03:09,207 --> 01:03:12,279
Fourteen? Twenty-seven?
I can't even remember.

633
01:03:12,384 --> 01:03:15,817
What different does it make if it's obvious that
I can't even control a few mops.

634
01:03:15,923 --> 01:03:17,795
The stronger the man,
the stronger the sorcerer

635
01:03:17,898 --> 01:03:21,233
- Thank you, thank you for another useless motto.
- I have another one for you.

636
01:03:21,340 --> 01:03:23,960
You will not control your magic
if you will not control yourself.

637
01:03:24,065 --> 01:03:26,707
You need to stop your worrying
and start believing in yourself.

638
01:03:26,812 --> 01:03:29,821
- Is that what you do?
- What I do isn't the point

639
01:03:29,926 --> 01:03:36,981
I think it is. I'm convinced you exist purely
to make my life a living hell.

640
01:03:37,094 --> 01:03:40,718
You don't know anything about a living hell.

641
01:03:44,841 --> 01:03:49,108
- You're making progress.
- No, I'm not making progress

642
01:03:49,927 --> 01:03:52,718
No ring, right?

643
01:03:55,441 --> 01:03:57,270
No magic.
I can't move the chairs.

644
01:03:57,373 --> 01:04:00,387
I can't do it.

645
01:04:00,779 --> 01:04:05,511
It's not me, Balthazar.
I'm sorry

646
01:04:05,840 --> 01:04:11,251
I'm not. I'm not a hero.
I'm not the Prime Merlinian.

647
01:04:11,361 --> 01:04:18,218
I'm just a physics nerd who
looks really really stupid in these shoes.

648
01:05:25,556 --> 01:05:27,556
Dave?

649
01:05:27,656 --> 01:05:30,605
What are you doing here?

650
01:05:30,711 --> 01:05:34,465
I saw you at the coffee shop,
So I followed you.

651
01:05:34,572 --> 01:05:37,851
You looked more distracted than usual.

652
01:05:37,957 --> 01:05:39,473
That bad, huh?

653
01:05:39,576 --> 01:05:44,654
Did you really think that one bad date
was gonna make me hate you forever?

654
01:05:46,130 --> 01:05:48,419
Yeah

655
01:05:48,530 --> 01:05:53,465
I do have to ask you this one thing.

656
01:05:54,783 --> 01:05:57,091
What are you doing up here?

657
01:05:57,195 --> 01:06:01,797
A friend of mine brought me here once.

658
01:06:01,905 --> 01:06:05,894
And the height doesn't bother you?

659
01:06:06,137 --> 01:06:08,596
- Are you afraid of heights?
- A little bit, yeah.

660
01:06:08,701 --> 01:06:10,871
Trust me. Here. Come on.

661
01:06:10,975 --> 01:06:13,039
Come on. You're good

662
01:06:13,142 --> 01:06:16,325
I don't know.

663
01:06:25,339 --> 01:06:28,520
Do you remember when you drew King Kong
in the bus window?

664
01:06:28,626 --> 01:06:32,285
And he lined up with
the Empire State Building?

665
01:06:32,392 --> 01:06:36,581
- You remember that?
- That was cool.

666
01:06:37,510 --> 01:06:41,346
You saw the world in your own way.

667
01:06:41,453 --> 01:06:44,575
I was just trying to impress you.

668
01:06:44,681 --> 01:06:49,795
Well, it worked.
Not bad for 10-year old kid.

669
01:06:49,904 --> 01:06:53,627
Right. What happened?

670
01:06:53,734 --> 01:06:55,447
What? What do you mean?

671
01:06:55,550 --> 01:07:00,929
The bitter irony of the fact that 10-year old me
is far cooler than 20-year old me.

672
01:07:01,039 --> 01:07:04,372
I think 20-year old Dave is alright

673
01:07:04,478 --> 01:07:10,374
Like alright - alright, or ALRIGHT - alright?

674
01:07:11,758 --> 01:07:15,759
I think he is somewhere in the middle

675
01:07:15,866 --> 01:07:19,345
That's a diplomatic answer.

676
01:07:19,761 --> 01:07:22,482
And thank you.

677
01:07:32,197 --> 01:07:36,173
I'm sorry I think you and I
need to have a talk.

678
01:07:36,282 --> 01:07:39,665
No apology necessary.
But let's move on.

679
01:07:39,770 --> 01:07:43,496
You're a darling, mate.

680
01:07:55,667 --> 01:07:59,941
Surprisingly well done.
Now go find the Grim Hold.

681
01:08:02,236 --> 01:08:05,621
You seem to have rather a soft spot
for that boy.

682
01:08:05,728 --> 01:08:08,910
Has Balthazar
made a new friend?

683
01:08:09,016 --> 01:08:12,885
- I don't see the Grim Hold.
- That's because you're using your eyes.

684
01:08:12,992 --> 01:08:17,917
Clever Balthazar.
Always up to his little tricks.

685
01:08:38,967 --> 01:08:41,689
Found it

686
01:08:43,346 --> 01:08:46,338
It's lighter than I remembered.

687
01:08:46,611 --> 01:08:50,454
- We once fought together, Maxim.
- A lot has happened since those days.

688
01:08:50,561 --> 01:08:54,302
- This isn't about that.
- Yes it is, Balthazar.

689
01:08:54,409 --> 01:08:59,112
It's always about that
Veronica chose you instead of me,

690
01:08:59,221 --> 01:09:02,794
The great Balthazar Blake,

691
01:09:03,029 --> 01:09:05,093
My best friend.

692
01:09:05,197 --> 01:09:09,559
Well, I'm going to let you watch me
release Morgana.

693
01:09:09,667 --> 01:09:14,197
Let you watch your world
crumble into nothing

694
01:09:34,008 --> 01:09:37,194
Drake. Let's go

695
01:09:38,182 --> 01:09:40,854
- Nice catch.
- Is that what you want?

696
01:09:40,958 --> 01:09:44,404
- They got the doll.
- We'll get it back.

697
01:09:47,039 --> 01:09:48,923
Hang on.

698
01:09:49,027 --> 01:09:51,950
Hang on, Tank.

699
01:10:04,992 --> 01:10:07,925
To the left.

700
01:10:12,718 --> 01:10:14,257
What the hell?

701
01:10:14,359 --> 01:10:15,602
He's in here somewhere

702
01:10:15,705 --> 01:10:18,419
Wait, he has the power to turn his car into
a taxi?

703
01:10:18,524 --> 01:10:22,019
Use your ring and lock in on the Grim Hold.
Remember, it moves with the ring.

704
01:10:22,126 --> 01:10:25,052
Okay, right .. right.

705
01:10:31,354 --> 01:10:33,902
Go. Go!

706
01:10:35,307 --> 01:10:38,408
There they come.

707
01:10:43,029 --> 01:10:45,034
What the heck?

708
01:10:45,138 --> 01:10:47,969
Nice one.

709
01:10:52,578 --> 01:10:56,535
- Look at that.
- Hang on.

710
01:11:02,167 --> 01:11:05,661
- Oh my god.
- Take the tunnel.

711
01:11:17,547 --> 01:11:20,747
What is that? Smoke?

712
01:11:24,718 --> 01:11:28,130
Come on.

713
01:11:37,890 --> 01:11:41,412
Time for a little revenge.

714
01:11:46,742 --> 01:11:48,039
What the heck is this?

715
01:11:48,142 --> 01:11:51,111
Yes, we drove through a mirror.
We're trapped in a reversed world.

716
01:11:51,216 --> 01:11:54,102
It is. Horvath's pay back.
For the bathroom mirror.

717
01:11:54,207 --> 01:11:56,528
Oh, no. no. We won't die
as long as we get out of here soon.

718
01:11:56,633 --> 01:11:58,375
By driving through our own reflection.

719
01:11:58,478 --> 01:12:00,596
Fantastic. There. In the window.

720
01:12:00,700 --> 01:12:03,732
This is it.

721
01:12:10,369 --> 01:12:12,370
Oh, no, no. You're not...

722
01:12:12,474 --> 01:12:15,073
- Here we go.
- We're not gonna make that.

723
01:12:36,777 --> 01:12:38,809
Hello, Balthazar.

724
01:12:38,914 --> 01:12:44,724
Oh, man. No, no. Back up. Back up!

725
01:12:45,948 --> 01:12:48,019
Oh, man.

726
01:12:48,122 --> 01:12:49,664
I got an idea. I got an idea.

727
01:12:49,767 --> 01:12:53,082
- Dave, don't.
- Please, I want to do it.

728
01:12:53,857 --> 01:12:56,704
- What?
- 73 Pinto? This is your idea?

729
01:12:56,810 --> 01:13:03,388
No. No.
My idea was to turn their car into a beater

730
01:13:07,825 --> 01:13:11,274
- Finish it.
- Right!

731
01:13:17,864 --> 01:13:21,555
I think he stopped.

732
01:13:30,801 --> 01:13:34,994
Hang up, Tank.
I got you, buddy.

733
01:13:55,163 --> 01:13:59,934
I am sorry I thought you're
someone else.

734
01:14:01,667 --> 01:14:04,933
Where is Horvath?
Did he get away?

735
01:14:05,039 --> 01:14:08,984
Where's the Grim Hold?
Who was that?

736
01:14:09,926 --> 01:14:14,384
That was her, wasn't it?
The third apprentice

737
01:14:16,731 --> 01:14:19,349
For centuries Veronica, Horvath and I...

738
01:14:19,455 --> 01:14:23,768
were the only thing standing between Morgana and
man's destruction

739
01:14:23,875 --> 01:14:29,395
Our friendship and our magic
were what Veronica and I depended on ..

740
01:14:29,559 --> 01:14:32,841
You fell for her, didn't you?

741
01:14:33,039 --> 01:14:36,219
I fell for her.

742
01:14:37,185 --> 01:14:41,174
.. like you, all Veronica wanted was to be normal.

743
01:14:41,281 --> 01:14:45,568
Normal things, normal life.

744
01:14:46,195 --> 01:14:49,081
I saw them.

745
01:14:50,232 --> 01:14:53,186
And so is Horvath ..

746
01:14:53,943 --> 01:14:56,222
That's why Horvath betrayed us.

747
01:14:56,326 --> 01:15:02,938
.. For a thousand years you've been carrying her
around with you. in the Grim Hold.

748
01:15:03,689 --> 01:15:07,442
I was going to give this to her that night.

749
01:15:14,660 --> 01:15:17,679
I am sorry

750
01:15:19,453 --> 01:15:26,314
Okay, Balthazar, we are going to get Veronica out
and destroy Morgana

751
01:15:27,092 --> 01:15:29,956
- What's happened to you?
- Nothing.

752
01:15:30,062 --> 01:15:32,916
- You're still a bad liar.
- Why does...

753
01:15:33,021 --> 01:15:35,313
You know, I'm glad she likes you.

754
01:15:35,417 --> 01:15:42,481
No, I am not surprised. Only glad.
There's nothing like it, is there?

755
01:15:43,712 --> 01:15:50,579
Put your old-man shoes back on.
We have some work to do.

756
01:15:53,776 --> 01:15:55,437
Are all the satellite dishes in position?

757
01:15:55,540 --> 01:15:59,473
All line up. I chip my nail, which is not cool.

758
01:15:59,580 --> 01:16:02,080
No, I imagine it is not.

759
01:16:02,184 --> 01:16:05,331
Inside there, lies our next co-worker

760
01:16:05,437 --> 01:16:10,098
Abigail Williams, the little witch who put
Salem on the map.

761
01:16:10,207 --> 01:16:12,738
Once she is out, we are at
the Morgana shell.

762
01:16:12,842 --> 01:16:16,278
that's going to take a lot of time and energy
to crack.

763
01:16:16,385 --> 01:16:20,635
- So, what are we gonna do?
- Have you heard of the parasite spell? No..

764
01:16:20,743 --> 01:16:25,253
No. Sorry, I forgot.
Your education is somewhat lacking

765
01:16:25,362 --> 01:16:29,664
And I prefer to get more by instincts.
Know it feels right.

766
01:16:29,771 --> 01:16:34,155
The parasite spell is a rather nasty piece of business

767
01:16:34,264 --> 01:16:37,751
It originated in Haiti, if memory serves

768
01:16:37,857 --> 01:16:43,079
It enables one sorcerer to steal
the energy from another

769
01:16:46,877 --> 01:16:51,168
But you weren't really using it, were you?

770
01:17:00,610 --> 01:17:03,491
Excuse me.
I'd like to make a request

771
01:17:03,596 --> 01:17:08,310
I just finished my show but
maybe next time, okay?

772
01:17:15,494 --> 01:17:19,230
I said I'd like to make a request

773
01:17:24,970 --> 01:17:31,520
When Morgana is released, no matter what happens,
promise me you'll do whatever it takes ...

774
01:17:31,632 --> 01:17:34,649
to destroy her.

775
01:17:34,755 --> 01:17:37,155
I promise.

776
01:17:37,259 --> 01:17:40,745
And for the record, you wear the old guy's shoes very well.

777
01:17:40,853 --> 01:17:47,159
My feet disagree with you. But thank you.
Knuckle bump!

778
01:17:48,539 --> 01:17:51,272
Might as well ..

779
01:17:51,378 --> 01:17:55,719
Now that I've kidnapped the girl for you,
Is it time to release Morgana?

780
01:17:55,826 --> 01:17:58,795
I'll give her your regards.

781
01:17:58,901 --> 01:18:02,312
Mr. Horvath, have I done something wrong?

782
01:18:03,272 --> 01:18:06,370
Not at all.
I need your power to free Morgana

783
01:18:06,476 --> 01:18:09,984
I just don't need you.

784
01:18:11,260 --> 01:18:15,375
Oh, that's two.
One more to go.

785
01:18:25,583 --> 01:18:27,236
That's horrifying

786
01:18:27,339 --> 01:18:30,815
Let's just find the Grim Hold
and be done with it

787
01:18:43,289 --> 01:18:47,668
Battery Park, the Rising.

788
01:18:54,165 --> 01:18:59,266
Persian carpet float.
And he thinks I'm old fashioned.

789
01:19:01,670 --> 01:19:04,919
Ostentatious.

790
01:19:23,193 --> 01:19:26,259
Nothing.

791
01:19:27,811 --> 01:19:31,115
So that's Morgana.

792
01:19:33,191 --> 01:19:35,911
Veronica.

793
01:19:46,144 --> 01:19:47,807
Balthazar?

794
01:19:47,910 --> 01:19:50,932
That was easy.
Come on, Dave. You know the drill

795
01:19:51,038 --> 01:19:54,228
- Give me what I want and I let her go.
- Dave, what's going on?

796
01:19:54,333 --> 01:19:57,817
- It is gonna be okay. You're gonna be okay.
- No, she is not.

797
01:19:57,924 --> 01:20:00,817
She's gonna be ground up into chunks
and fed to the cat ...

798
01:20:00,922 --> 01:20:03,910
unless you give me Merlin's ring
and the Grim Hold.

799
01:20:04,016 --> 01:20:09,470
And Balthazar? He is busy admiring the decor.
So what's it going to be?

800
01:20:36,957 --> 01:20:39,464
Here.

801
01:20:40,033 --> 01:20:42,983
Take it.

802
01:20:46,669 --> 01:20:51,411
Merlin's ring. It's been a while
since I've been this close to it.

803
01:20:51,703 --> 01:20:55,063
I wonder if it still works.

804
01:20:59,171 --> 01:21:02,869
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I guess.

805
01:21:08,099 --> 01:21:11,256
The Grim Hold?

806
01:21:12,666 --> 01:21:14,666
I see.

807
01:21:14,736 --> 01:21:20,447
He took my ring.
He was gonna kill Becky

808
01:21:20,558 --> 01:21:23,331
I'm so sorry, Balthazar.

809
01:21:23,436 --> 01:21:26,843
I would have done the same thing, Dave.

810
01:21:29,387 --> 01:21:30,877
Where are you going?

811
01:21:30,979 --> 01:21:33,459
Battery Park.
Horvath is going to release Morgana.

812
01:21:33,564 --> 01:21:36,870
You can't take him on and Morgana
at the same time.

813
01:21:36,976 --> 01:21:40,163
- That's... You literally can't.
- I have to try.

814
01:21:40,269 --> 01:21:42,110
Well then I'm going with you.

815
01:21:42,214 --> 01:21:47,985
Without any magic? He has your ring.
I am going alone.

816
01:21:48,095 --> 01:21:52,546
No. That's normal thing for him

817
01:21:54,350 --> 01:21:57,726
No one knows how much time they have...

818
01:21:57,832 --> 01:22:03,427
.. to be with the people who are the most important.
Enjoy it.

819
01:22:15,789 --> 01:22:19,963
That guy just flew away on an eagle.
A steel eagle.

820
01:22:20,070 --> 01:22:24,916
Becky, I wanted to talk to you about this.
I just don't know where to start.

821
01:22:25,025 --> 01:22:27,486
I'm just happy you're okay.

822
01:22:27,592 --> 01:22:30,084
Look, Dave...

823
01:22:30,188 --> 01:22:37,043
if you just can tell the truth, then I promise
I would do my best to understand.

824
01:22:37,200 --> 01:22:42,705
Okay. The first thing you should know about me
is that I am a sorcerer.

825
01:22:44,206 --> 01:22:45,398
Okay

826
01:22:45,501 --> 01:22:49,928
I can conjure and duke plasma balls
out of my hands.

827
01:22:50,035 --> 01:22:53,890
I can speed up time, slow it down,
various degrees of levitation.

828
01:22:53,998 --> 01:22:57,785
And it was all very magical.

829
01:22:58,287 --> 01:23:03,605
And I thought my last boyfriend
was different, because he wore a scarf.

830
01:23:07,022 --> 01:23:11,603
- I'll come back, okay?
- Okay

831
01:23:11,712 --> 01:23:15,495
- I'll be back.
- Well I am here.

832
01:23:18,636 --> 01:23:21,241
- Bad time, Dave.
- Bennet, thank God you answered.

833
01:23:21,346 --> 01:23:25,954
I got a real emergency on my hand.
I need you to meet me at my lab. Right now.

834
01:23:27,183 --> 01:23:31,098
- Becky, I got to let you out.
- Let me out?

835
01:23:31,453 --> 01:23:33,792
- Okay
- I think I know how to defeat them ...

836
01:23:33,896 --> 01:23:36,572
- .. without any magic.
- How?

837
01:23:36,678 --> 01:23:40,015
The rings on Horvath's cane.
He put them there in order to gain more power,

838
01:23:40,121 --> 01:23:42,537
but they make him
a better conductor

839
01:23:42,641 --> 01:23:45,879
Dave, I have no idea
what you are talking about

840
01:23:45,985 --> 01:23:48,593
Alright, Rebecca. Here it is.

841
01:23:48,906 --> 01:23:53,135
Many evil sorcerers will be raised
from the dead tonight.

842
01:23:53,242 --> 01:23:57,850
So basically, Morgana is going to destroy
the world as we know it.

843
01:23:58,044 --> 01:24:00,099
Oh, just that?

844
01:24:00,203 --> 01:24:03,832
This is really dangerous.
I can't bring you into it

845
01:24:03,938 --> 01:24:06,541
Well, I think I'm already into it

846
01:24:06,647 --> 01:24:10,255
And besides as you brought it,
we're all gonna die anyway, right?

847
01:24:10,557 --> 01:24:13,472
I want to come with you.

848
01:24:14,415 --> 01:24:17,030
You're sexy.

849
01:24:17,739 --> 01:24:21,097
- I got all the Tesla coil remote.
- Thanks, brother. I appreciate it.

850
01:24:21,204 --> 01:24:24,512
I found this after we hang up

851
01:24:25,004 --> 01:24:27,533
It was on the desk.

852
01:24:27,638 --> 01:24:30,646
Give it to Veronica. Balthazar.

853
01:24:36,450 --> 01:24:41,065
I don't think Balthazar is
planning on coming back.

854
01:24:41,255 --> 01:24:48,970
I don't know what you're into here, Dave
but whatever it is you are getting me participating.

855
01:24:49,702 --> 01:24:53,317
Thank you, Bennet. I appreciate it.
We should go.

856
01:25:04,870 --> 01:25:07,885
Now is the Rising.

857
01:25:09,039 --> 01:25:12,100
Now is the time

858
01:25:38,104 --> 01:25:40,658
Veronica.

859
01:25:42,017 --> 01:25:48,403
It's me, Horvath. Morgana.
No need to look so pathetic.

860
01:25:49,873 --> 01:25:54,371
Destroy that thing.
I never want to see it again.

861
01:25:55,246 --> 01:25:59,540
I can not raise the dead
until the circle is complete.

862
01:26:02,724 --> 01:26:18,971
Spirit, I wear you on to terror
bring your terrible forces.

863
01:26:23,486 --> 01:26:24,821
No way

864
01:26:24,924 --> 01:26:26,753
- Man alive!
- What?

865
01:26:26,856 --> 01:26:30,313
- Are you telling you honestly don't see that?
- No. See what?

866
01:26:30,420 --> 01:26:33,028
I think they're using the satellite dishes
on the tops of the buildings...

867
01:26:33,132 --> 01:26:35,766
to direct and amplify the electromagnetic energy

868
01:26:35,871 --> 01:26:39,209
Alright, we're pulling over.

869
01:26:41,662 --> 01:26:44,021
Becky, I need you to do me a favor.

870
01:26:44,126 --> 01:26:48,021
I need you to go up to the very top of that thing.

871
01:26:48,878 --> 01:26:50,878
- Great.
- You gotta move the antenna...

872
01:26:50,920 --> 01:26:55,704
- .. and just disrupt the signal.
- OK. Right.

873
01:26:56,060 --> 01:27:00,178
Becky. Remember that letter I wrote
when we're ten years old?

874
01:27:00,286 --> 01:27:04,980
Friend or girlfriend?
I never saw what you checked, so...

875
01:27:05,089 --> 01:27:08,185
in case I die tonight, could you please tell me

876
01:27:08,674 --> 01:27:11,388
Don't die and I'll tell you.

877
01:27:11,492 --> 01:27:14,379
Oh. Yeah, okay.

878
01:27:46,122 --> 01:27:48,431
Balthazar.

879
01:27:50,906 --> 01:27:55,102
- Enough of your old tricks, Balthazar.
- As you wish.

880
01:28:03,186 --> 01:28:07,671
There was a time when things are pretty even
between us, Balthazar.

881
01:28:07,778 --> 01:28:13,489
As you can see, I've acquired
some new jewelry.

882
01:28:16,747 --> 01:28:19,261
I'm coming, buddy. I'm coming.

883
01:28:19,367 --> 01:28:23,397
Alright. What? What is this?
What am I looking at? No.

884
01:28:23,504 --> 01:28:28,944
Come... And a walker.
Of course she has...

885
01:28:36,016 --> 01:28:41,840
A matador gored by a bull
can take up to three days to die

886
01:28:41,951 --> 01:28:45,228
Sounds unpleasant, doesn't it?

887
01:29:28,926 --> 01:29:33,481
The circle is nearly complete.
It must be awful, Balthazar.

888
01:29:33,590 --> 01:29:40,166
All these years fighting to stop this one moment.
And then coming up short.

889
01:30:16,857 --> 01:30:19,900
That's my car.

890
01:30:35,459 --> 01:30:38,284
Thank you.

891
01:30:46,733 --> 01:30:49,673
We're too late.

892
01:31:05,904 --> 01:31:08,650
Veronica.

893
01:31:10,982 --> 01:31:13,828
Is she...

894
01:31:14,573 --> 01:31:17,672
They're both still with us.

895
01:31:43,604 --> 01:31:46,721
Balthazar. What have you done?

896
01:31:46,827 --> 01:31:50,374
What you did for me.

897
01:31:52,182 --> 01:31:53,884
Remember your promise.
Balthazar, no.

898
01:31:53,987 --> 01:31:56,194
You will do whatever
it takes to destroy Morgana.

899
01:31:56,298 --> 01:31:59,932
No, I can't.
I will not lock you in this thing.

900
01:32:00,038 --> 01:32:02,458
And neither will I.

901
01:32:02,563 --> 01:32:05,766
How sweet.

902
01:32:15,831 --> 01:32:18,535
Oh, man.

903
01:32:19,729 --> 01:32:21,844
And now we end this.

904
01:32:21,947 --> 01:32:24,186
No.

905
01:32:27,911 --> 01:32:30,981
No way.

906
01:32:35,135 --> 01:32:36,372
No ring.

907
01:32:36,475 --> 01:32:40,188
- It is you.
- The Prime Merlinian.

908
01:32:45,414 --> 01:32:48,198
Veronica.

909
01:32:55,632 --> 01:32:59,073
Now it's my turn.

910
01:33:05,335 --> 01:33:08,647
Is that the best that you can do?

911
01:33:08,753 --> 01:33:11,847
I sure hope not.

912
01:33:27,581 --> 01:33:31,923
And now it's my turn.

913
01:34:05,591 --> 01:34:10,842
You have Merlin's powers, but you don't have
his strength or skill.

914
01:34:10,951 --> 01:34:13,280
You are still weak.

915
01:34:13,384 --> 01:34:17,369
But I'm not alone.
I brought a little science with me

916
01:34:17,477 --> 01:34:19,964
Now.

917
01:35:00,483 --> 01:35:05,328
I did it.
Balthazar, I actually did it

918
01:35:14,407 --> 01:35:17,592
He's gone.

919
01:35:19,807 --> 01:35:23,200
He completed his quest.

920
01:35:24,255 --> 01:35:31,713
No, no.. no. It's not over.
He can't die. Not now.

921
01:35:33,995 --> 01:35:36,997
Come on.

922
01:35:52,725 --> 01:35:56,021
That's not good enough.

923
01:35:57,250 --> 01:36:00,236
Veronica, would you please step back.

924
01:36:00,342 --> 01:36:05,200
If Morgana can stop his heart
maybe I can start it.

925
01:36:09,431 --> 01:36:12,279
Alright, here we go, buddy.
Here we go. Listen.

926
01:36:12,385 --> 01:36:17,885
You with all your stupid rules
and old-man shoes.

927
01:36:17,995 --> 01:36:21,884
Always saving me with that look in your eyes.

928
01:36:22,958 --> 01:36:27,432
Come on.

929
01:36:27,541 --> 01:36:29,987
Come on.

930
01:36:41,954 --> 01:36:45,315
I had a dream.

931
01:36:46,026 --> 01:36:50,632
You were insulting me, Dave.
Repeatedly.

932
01:36:50,741 --> 01:36:53,951
Me? Pretty weird, huh?

933
01:36:54,057 --> 01:36:56,905
No, it kind of make sense.

934
01:36:57,010 --> 01:36:59,241
Yeah.

935
01:37:02,693 --> 01:37:06,098
- Thank you.
- Welcome back, old man.

936
01:37:29,585 --> 01:37:32,171
Dave.

937
01:37:35,488 --> 01:37:39,037
You did it.
I know. I'm still alive.

938
01:37:39,144 --> 01:37:42,217
- Surprisingly, so am I
- I know.

939
01:37:42,323 --> 01:37:44,726
Oh, the note, right.
Friend or girlfriend?

940
01:37:44,831 --> 01:37:47,764
I don't care

941
01:37:51,210 --> 01:37:54,744
Girlfriend
Definitely girlfriend

942
01:37:58,355 --> 01:38:05,231
Do you like to have breakfast with me? France...
- France?

943
01:38:07,348 --> 01:38:09,348
I got a ride

944
01:38:09,446 --> 01:38:12,595
Okay, you're funny.

945
01:38:16,713 --> 01:38:19,894
Something I forgot to mention to you...

946
01:38:20,000 --> 01:38:24,234
I really have no idea
how to land this thing.

947
01:38:29,466 --> 01:38:34,086
