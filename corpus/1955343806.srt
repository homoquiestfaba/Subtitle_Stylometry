Subrip by DanDee

2
00:01:54,421 --> 00:01:58,959
Like in those movies that start
out as a simple misunderstanding,

3
00:01:58,992 --> 00:02:03,531
then it snowballs until the situation
gets completely out of control.

4
00:02:03,563 --> 00:02:06,900
And then the main character has to
explain everything that happened,

5
00:02:06,933 --> 00:02:08,267
but the person they're
explaining it to

6
00:02:08,268 --> 00:02:11,204
is never really gonna understand
because they weren't there.

7
00:02:11,237 --> 00:02:13,941
I always thought it would be
great if they could just hand them

8
00:02:13,973 --> 00:02:17,078
a copy of the movie
and say, "Watch this.

9
00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:18,578
"It'll explain everything."

10
00:02:18,611 --> 00:02:20,046
What?

11
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:22,850
<i>Like in Don't Tell Mom
the Babysitter's Dead,</i>

12
00:02:22,883 --> 00:02:25,184
when the mom comes home
at the end of the movie,

13
00:02:25,218 --> 00:02:26,819
and everything's
out of control,

14
00:02:26,854 --> 00:02:29,323
Christina Applegate
could just give her mom

15
00:02:29,355 --> 00:02:31,825
<i>a tape of Don't Tell Mom
the Babysitter's Dead.</i>

16
00:02:31,859 --> 00:02:34,032
The character in the movie
has a copy of the movie?

17
00:02:34,328 --> 00:02:35,795
Yeah.

18
00:02:35,829 --> 00:02:38,965
Like the actual VHS you can buy at the
store with the cover and everything?

19
00:02:38,966 --> 00:02:40,401
Yeah!

20
00:02:40,433 --> 00:02:41,567
That's fucking retarded.

21
00:02:41,568 --> 00:02:43,569
But then the mom
could watch it,

22
00:02:43,604 --> 00:02:44,704
see everything that happened

23
00:02:44,705 --> 00:02:46,974
and how it all
started out so innocent.

24
00:02:47,007 --> 00:02:48,775
Give that bitch
a Blu-ray maybe.

25
00:02:48,808 --> 00:02:50,142
I mean, wouldn't that
be fucking cool?

26
00:02:50,143 --> 00:02:51,443
Jesus Christ!

27
00:02:52,545 --> 00:02:54,548
Look at that tasty bitch.

28
00:02:56,682 --> 00:02:59,620
It was an ordinary day for
Matthew and Jesse

29
00:02:59,653 --> 00:03:04,258
until a hot piece of ass
turned their world upside down.

30
00:03:05,391 --> 00:03:06,491
Hello, there.

31
00:03:06,492 --> 00:03:07,176
Hey!

32
00:03:07,177 --> 00:03:07,860
Hey.

33
00:03:07,894 --> 00:03:10,597
Can I ask you guys a favor?
My phone died.

34
00:03:10,631 --> 00:03:12,500
Do you have one I could borrow?

35
00:03:12,532 --> 00:03:13,966
Of course. Jesse,
give her your phone.

36
00:03:13,967 --> 00:03:15,967
- Thank you so much. I'll only be a minute.
- Sure.

37
00:04:06,187 --> 00:04:07,252
Hello.

38
00:04:07,253 --> 00:04:09,889
<i>Hey! Is... Um, um...</i>

39
00:04:09,923 --> 00:04:11,559
<i>I was looking for Mel.</i>

40
00:04:12,391 --> 00:04:13,691
Okay.

41
00:04:14,694 --> 00:04:17,031
<i>- Is he...
- There's a girl on the phone for you.</i>

42
00:04:21,067 --> 00:04:22,835
I told her you were busy
eating my pussy out.

43
00:04:22,836 --> 00:04:24,905
Don't fuck around.
This is a business line.

44
00:04:25,338 --> 00:04:26,906
Sampson.

45
00:04:26,939 --> 00:04:30,177
<i>Hey, Mel, it's, uh, Dorothy.</i>

46
00:04:30,209 --> 00:04:31,628
<i>About three years ago, we...</i>

47
00:04:31,629 --> 00:04:33,046
I remember.

48
00:04:34,413 --> 00:04:37,317
<i>Long time, no talk, huh?</i>

49
00:04:38,418 --> 00:04:39,853
<i>Um...</i>

50
00:04:39,887 --> 00:04:41,072
<i>Is this a bad time?</i>

51
00:04:41,073 --> 00:04:42,256
No.

52
00:04:44,958 --> 00:04:46,427
<i>I know it's been
a while, but...</i>

53
00:04:46,428 --> 00:04:47,895
Are you okay?

54
00:04:48,694 --> 00:04:51,430
<i>Uh, that's a good question.</i>

55
00:04:51,463 --> 00:04:53,132
<i>I don't know exactly.</i>

56
00:04:53,166 --> 00:04:54,934
Where are you?

57
00:04:54,968 --> 00:04:57,570
<i>I'm on Radio Hill across
from Dodger Stadium.</i>

58
00:04:57,603 --> 00:04:58,938
<i>- Right.
- Do you know where that is?</i>

59
00:04:58,971 --> 00:05:00,841
I do.
Yeah, I'm close.

60
00:05:00,874 --> 00:05:01,974
I'll be there soon.

61
00:05:01,975 --> 00:05:03,275
<i>Thanks.</i>

62
00:05:04,778 --> 00:05:07,948
Uh, just lock up
on your way out.

63
00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:09,632
I thought we were
getting Chinese Food?

64
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:12,050
What the fuck?

65
00:05:28,802 --> 00:05:30,054
It's Mel, huh?

66
00:05:30,055 --> 00:05:31,305
That's right.

67
00:05:32,372 --> 00:05:33,638
You want my number, Mel?

68
00:05:33,639 --> 00:05:34,939
Yeah, write it down.

69
00:06:11,245 --> 00:06:12,545
Thank you.

70
00:06:13,312 --> 00:06:14,880
Thank you so much.

71
00:06:14,913 --> 00:06:15,965
I really appreciate it.

72
00:06:15,966 --> 00:06:17,016
Yeah, no problem.

73
00:06:17,050 --> 00:06:18,035
I'm Matthew by the way.

74
00:06:18,036 --> 00:06:19,019
Hey, Dorothy.

75
00:06:19,052 --> 00:06:21,120
Dorothy, pleasure to meet you.

76
00:06:21,154 --> 00:06:22,321
This is Jesse.

77
00:06:22,322 --> 00:06:22,973
Hey.

78
00:06:22,974 --> 00:06:23,623
Hey.

79
00:06:23,656 --> 00:06:26,593
So what brings you all the
way up here on this fine morning?

80
00:06:26,627 --> 00:06:29,062
Um, I don't know. Just trying
to clear my head, I guess.

81
00:06:29,495 --> 00:06:31,330
All right.

82
00:06:31,365 --> 00:06:32,900
What about you guys?

83
00:06:32,932 --> 00:06:36,403
Oh well, uh...
We're selling drugs.

84
00:06:37,737 --> 00:06:38,955
Really?

85
00:06:38,956 --> 00:06:40,173
Yeah, what's your poison?

86
00:06:40,206 --> 00:06:42,242
Weed? Mushrooms? Acid?

87
00:06:42,274 --> 00:06:44,443
We've got whatever
you need to clear your head.

88
00:06:44,476 --> 00:06:45,294
Oh, my God.

89
00:06:45,295 --> 00:06:46,112
Come on.

90
00:06:46,146 --> 00:06:47,345
It's on the house.

91
00:06:47,346 --> 00:06:48,911
I don't really do
that kind of thing.

92
00:06:48,915 --> 00:06:51,517
Ah. Good girl, huh?

93
00:06:51,552 --> 00:06:54,121
Hardly.
I did ecstasy once.

94
00:06:54,153 --> 00:06:55,088
Ooh-la-la.

95
00:06:55,089 --> 00:06:56,023
Oh, it's not sexual.

96
00:06:56,055 --> 00:06:57,355
Hmm.

97
00:06:57,958 --> 00:06:59,258
Yeah.

98
00:07:00,793 --> 00:07:02,228
Do you guys have any of that?

99
00:07:02,262 --> 00:07:05,399
- I could stand to feel good right about now.
- Of course.

100
00:07:05,432 --> 00:07:08,735
Jesse, give the fine lady
some ecstasy.

101
00:07:10,870 --> 00:07:11,604
My lady.

102
00:07:11,605 --> 00:07:12,338
Thanks.

103
00:07:13,706 --> 00:07:15,141
This is so stupid.

104
00:07:17,577 --> 00:07:18,977
All right!

105
00:07:19,012 --> 00:07:20,311
We gotta meet
in the butterfly garden.

106
00:07:20,312 --> 00:07:22,582
Ah, so we gotta go see
a customer in the butterfly garden,

107
00:07:22,583 --> 00:07:24,485
but do you wanna
join us for brunch?

108
00:07:25,384 --> 00:07:26,905
I'm supposed to be
meeting a friend.

109
00:07:27,521 --> 00:07:29,122
We're your friends now.

110
00:07:29,154 --> 00:07:30,756
Come on. Are you still going to
be here in ten minutes?

111
00:07:30,757 --> 00:07:32,057
I hope not.

112
00:07:32,459 --> 00:07:33,860
Now, now.

113
00:07:33,894 --> 00:07:37,663
You stay right here, and we'll come back
and we will whisk you away

114
00:07:37,697 --> 00:07:40,966
for some mimosas,
some French toast,

115
00:07:41,999 --> 00:07:44,069
a little bacon-infused
caramel sauce.

116
00:07:44,103 --> 00:07:45,270
We'll see.

117
00:07:45,271 --> 00:07:48,074
Oh, we will see you at brunch!

118
00:08:54,541 --> 00:08:56,744
That's against park policy.

119
00:08:56,777 --> 00:08:58,312
Oh, my God,

120
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:01,313
have you been there
this whole time?

121
00:09:01,346 --> 00:09:03,516
You scared the shit out of me.

122
00:09:03,549 --> 00:09:06,118
Just long enough to let this
tree grow up around me.

123
00:09:08,187 --> 00:09:10,023
Now you stopped me
mid-stream.

124
00:09:10,057 --> 00:09:11,825
Well, that's
bad for the kidneys.

125
00:09:11,857 --> 00:09:13,826
You want I should
close my eyes?

126
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:15,207
No, I think the
moment's passed.

127
00:09:17,864 --> 00:09:22,069
To be honest I didn't know whether
to pipe up or just enjoy the show.

128
00:09:22,101 --> 00:09:23,369
I thought I was
up here all alone.

129
00:09:23,370 --> 00:09:26,240
I didn't realize people
came around nowadays.

130
00:09:26,273 --> 00:09:28,041
We don't get much foot traffic.

131
00:09:28,073 --> 00:09:30,710
Just the lovers,
the dreamers, and me.

132
00:09:32,111 --> 00:09:33,411
I guess I'm the dreamer.

133
00:09:34,647 --> 00:09:36,383
What does that make you?

134
00:09:36,416 --> 00:09:38,185
Oh, I'm a different
sort altogether.

135
00:09:40,453 --> 00:09:41,888
Well, now that
we're acquainted...

136
00:09:44,524 --> 00:09:48,729
Uh, I've been up for 32 hours

137
00:09:48,761 --> 00:09:51,697
and haven't eaten in
almost that long.

138
00:09:51,730 --> 00:09:54,634
Do you got another one
of those Pink Ladies?

139
00:09:54,668 --> 00:09:58,205
I always carry two apples,
just in case I make a friend.

140
00:10:02,207 --> 00:10:03,809
Thanks.

141
00:10:03,842 --> 00:10:05,363
I'm supposed to be
meeting a friend,

142
00:10:05,378 --> 00:10:07,881
but I guess I could
pass the time.

143
00:10:09,115 --> 00:10:11,249
Well it's a proven fact
that every job goes quicker

144
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:13,019
when you got two people on it,

145
00:10:13,052 --> 00:10:14,754
so with the two of us
working together,

146
00:10:14,788 --> 00:10:17,005
we'll get your time passed
before the whistle blows.

147
00:10:18,791 --> 00:10:21,312
That's a refreshingly sanguine
way of looking at the world.

148
00:10:23,363 --> 00:10:24,731
I'm Dorothy, by the way.

149
00:10:24,764 --> 00:10:26,764
Fontaine. It's a pleasure
to meet you, Dorothy.

150
00:10:27,366 --> 00:10:28,967
What's your first name?

151
00:10:29,001 --> 00:10:31,603
Uh, I guess we'll just stick to
Fontaine if it's all right with you.

152
00:10:31,604 --> 00:10:33,440
Uh-uh.

153
00:10:33,474 --> 00:10:36,343
I'm not calling you Fontaine like
one of your locker room buddies.

154
00:10:37,243 --> 00:10:39,613
My given name ain't much
if you ask me,

155
00:10:39,645 --> 00:10:42,688
which of course nobody ever did
before seeing fit that it stuck to me.

156
00:10:44,149 --> 00:10:46,819
Listen. I've been
hearing about red shoes

157
00:10:46,852 --> 00:10:48,254
and tornadoes
my whole damn life,

158
00:10:48,288 --> 00:10:49,989
so you're not gonna get
any sympathy from me.

159
00:10:49,990 --> 00:10:51,290
Let's have it.

160
00:10:51,791 --> 00:10:53,826
Yeah.

161
00:10:53,860 --> 00:10:55,962
It's Skippy, if you gotta
stick your nose in it.

162
00:10:55,995 --> 00:10:57,764
Skippy Fontaine.

163
00:10:58,798 --> 00:10:59,582
That's bad.

164
00:10:59,583 --> 00:11:00,365
All right.

165
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:02,435
Let's just keep things
moving forward.

166
00:11:02,469 --> 00:11:04,034
What do you do
for a living, Dorothy?

167
00:11:05,572 --> 00:11:07,474
I'm a dancer.

168
00:11:07,506 --> 00:11:11,611
You mean like ballet,
or do you mean maybe the dirty kind?

169
00:11:13,046 --> 00:11:14,581
I mean maybe the dirty kind.

170
00:11:14,614 --> 00:11:16,483
I knew it.

171
00:11:16,515 --> 00:11:18,418
You got that
twinkle in your eye.

172
00:11:18,451 --> 00:11:20,086
It's kind of you
to notice my eyes.

173
00:11:20,119 --> 00:11:21,455
There's nothing wrong with it.

174
00:11:21,488 --> 00:11:23,189
My mother was a stripper.

175
00:11:23,221 --> 00:11:24,658
My grandmother was a stripper.

176
00:11:24,691 --> 00:11:26,793
I come from
a long line of strippers.

177
00:11:26,826 --> 00:11:29,261
Well, I'm definitely
first generation.

178
00:11:29,296 --> 00:11:32,632
Now, on my dad's side, I come from
a long line of park rangers.

179
00:11:32,664 --> 00:11:36,068
And strippers and rangers get along
real good together, you know why?

180
00:11:36,101 --> 00:11:38,371
They both like to bask
in natural beauty.

181
00:11:39,873 --> 00:11:41,105
You're a hoot.

182
00:11:41,106 --> 00:11:42,641
Well, I'm giving you
my best material,

183
00:11:42,642 --> 00:11:44,476
'cause it sounds like
I got precious few minutes

184
00:11:44,477 --> 00:11:46,947
to make an impression
before your friend gets here.

185
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:48,280
What time's she due?

186
00:11:49,649 --> 00:11:50,784
He.

187
00:11:50,785 --> 00:11:51,918
Oh, well that tears it.

188
00:11:51,951 --> 00:11:52,719
Nice to meet ya.

189
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:53,486
Oh come on.

190
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:56,345
You only want to talk to me
if you think you can get in my pants?

191
00:11:57,557 --> 00:11:58,926
Not at all.

192
00:12:00,259 --> 00:12:04,130
But it does add an exciting
air of mystery to the scene.

193
00:12:06,633 --> 00:12:07,968
Well he's not my boyfriend.

194
00:12:09,969 --> 00:12:11,271
Not that that should matter.

195
00:12:14,106 --> 00:12:15,406
Just a friend, huh?

196
00:12:20,145 --> 00:12:21,581
I don't know...

197
00:12:21,615 --> 00:12:24,571
He's just a guy I met a few years
back and I haven't seen him since.

198
00:12:29,956 --> 00:12:31,491
Well, what's so
special about him?

199
00:12:34,594 --> 00:12:39,867
Nothing special. There's some people
that you don't forget,

200
00:12:41,467 --> 00:12:43,380
even if you've only
seen 'em one time or two.

201
00:12:43,903 --> 00:12:45,672
Now that's poetry.

202
00:12:45,706 --> 00:12:48,075
- Hmm.
- You think I'll be one of those people?

203
00:12:49,542 --> 00:12:51,144
Ask me in three years.

204
00:12:51,177 --> 00:12:52,545
Touche.

205
00:12:52,578 --> 00:12:54,080
That does not deserve a touche.

206
00:12:54,847 --> 00:12:56,515
I'm off my game today.

207
00:12:56,549 --> 00:12:58,451
Oh, you just need
a little time in bed.

208
00:12:58,485 --> 00:13:00,988
Hmm. Sleep, you mean?

209
00:13:01,955 --> 00:13:03,255
I do.

210
00:13:04,691 --> 00:13:06,692
I just have too much
on my mind.

211
00:13:06,725 --> 00:13:09,128
You know what I do when I need
to take my mind off things?

212
00:13:09,129 --> 00:13:10,629
I go see a movie.

213
00:13:10,663 --> 00:13:12,966
And, yes, that is an
invitation by the way.

214
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,501
There's nothing I want to see.

215
00:13:15,534 --> 00:13:16,834
You don't like movies?

216
00:13:18,203 --> 00:13:19,772
I guess I'm more of a reader.

217
00:13:19,806 --> 00:13:21,908
I like old movies.

218
00:13:21,941 --> 00:13:24,543
Well then you live in
just the right town for that.

219
00:13:24,576 --> 00:13:30,515
You've got the New Beverly, the Silent
Movie Theater, the Egyptian, the Aero...

220
00:13:30,549 --> 00:13:33,853
There's an old movie playing every
night of the year in Los Angeles.

221
00:13:33,886 --> 00:13:38,057
And did you know that they even screen old
movies at the Hollywood Cemetery?

222
00:13:38,091 --> 00:13:40,060
Right on the wall
of the mausoleum.

223
00:13:40,092 --> 00:13:42,928
Now that is where
I'd like to be buried,

224
00:13:42,962 --> 00:13:45,565
cuddled up in my grave,
next to Jayne Mansfield

225
00:13:45,599 --> 00:13:47,267
and watching scary
movies together.

226
00:13:48,735 --> 00:13:50,343
You have quite
the death ahead of you.

227
00:13:52,471 --> 00:13:54,688
You know my favorite part
about going to the movies?

228
00:13:55,441 --> 00:13:56,809
The trailers?

229
00:13:56,810 --> 00:13:58,177
The chewies.

230
00:13:58,211 --> 00:14:00,447
The what?

231
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:03,014
That's one of the four
movie food groups.

232
00:14:03,048 --> 00:14:04,917
You got your popcorn,
you got your soda pop,

233
00:14:04,951 --> 00:14:07,019
you got your chocolate,
and you got your chewy.

234
00:14:07,052 --> 00:14:08,487
And that's my favorite.

235
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:10,221
You gotta have one item
from each food group

236
00:14:10,222 --> 00:14:11,890
for a balanced meal,
and I always save

237
00:14:11,924 --> 00:14:12,842
my chewy for last.

238
00:14:12,843 --> 00:14:13,759
Mmm-hmm.

239
00:14:13,793 --> 00:14:16,663
And you'd better watch out
if I don't get my chewy.

240
00:14:16,696 --> 00:14:18,163
Yeah.

241
00:14:18,197 --> 00:14:19,966
You mean like
Twizzlers and things?

242
00:14:19,999 --> 00:14:21,167
Mmm-hmm.

243
00:14:21,168 --> 00:14:23,202
That stuff is disgusting.

244
00:14:23,235 --> 00:14:24,937
Well, what about
circus peanuts?

245
00:14:24,971 --> 00:14:27,474
You can't tell me you don't at least
like circus peanuts.

246
00:14:29,475 --> 00:14:31,043
Am I boring you, Miss Dorothy?

247
00:14:32,912 --> 00:14:36,615
I'm sorry. I'm just a,
a bit distracted today.

248
00:14:37,951 --> 00:14:40,120
Well, I got real good ears.

249
00:14:42,621 --> 00:14:43,921
Just some trouble with work.

250
00:14:45,857 --> 00:14:48,683
Did you go up on stage forgetting
you had on your granny panties?

251
00:14:49,162 --> 00:14:51,064
No, nothing that serious.

252
00:14:51,563 --> 00:14:52,863
Hmm.

253
00:14:55,534 --> 00:14:57,490
I just think I saw
something I shouldn't have.

254
00:14:58,605 --> 00:15:01,407
I've been in trouble for seeing things
I shouldn't have.

255
00:15:01,441 --> 00:15:03,242
Of course I was standin'
on top of the trash cans

256
00:15:03,243 --> 00:15:05,912
peering into Sue Ellen Adcock's bedroom
window at the time.

257
00:15:05,945 --> 00:15:08,215
Hmm, you're good.

258
00:15:08,248 --> 00:15:10,483
Well, I was only
trying to change my name.

259
00:15:10,517 --> 00:15:13,019
See I'd much rather be
called Tom than Skippy...

260
00:15:13,052 --> 00:15:15,120
even if I am one of
the peeping kind.

261
00:15:17,591 --> 00:15:18,957
<i>Tommy, this is station.</i>

262
00:15:18,991 --> 00:15:21,160
<i>You on Radio Hill? Over.</i>

263
00:15:22,495 --> 00:15:25,631
<i>Station to Tommy,
gonna need that 20. Over.</i>

264
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:28,734
<i>You still near Radio Hill?</i>

265
00:15:28,768 --> 00:15:31,571
<i>We're gonna need you
to go over to the butterfly garden.</i>

266
00:15:31,604 --> 00:15:34,074
<i>Got some suspicious
activity there. Over.</i>

267
00:15:37,576 --> 00:15:38,912
<i>Station to Tom?</i>

268
00:15:41,313 --> 00:15:44,617
<i>Station to Ranger, pick up
on that butterfly garden. Over.</i>

269
00:15:44,650 --> 00:15:49,389
Sue Ellen Adcock
was a shapely lady.

270
00:15:49,422 --> 00:15:52,292
Well, anyway...

271
00:15:52,293 --> 00:15:55,161
Well, you certainly are
cheering me up.

272
00:15:55,193 --> 00:15:58,430
Well, I'm doing my best
to turn that frown upside down,

273
00:15:58,464 --> 00:16:01,068
but your mind is
not on my folksy yarns.

274
00:16:05,504 --> 00:16:09,040
Don't you hate it when
you've got something good going,

275
00:16:09,075 --> 00:16:12,278
and then someone comes along

276
00:16:12,311 --> 00:16:15,215
and mixes in something
just fucking lousy?

277
00:16:15,248 --> 00:16:16,614
You mean
like when they go and mix

278
00:16:16,615 --> 00:16:18,528
cranberries into your
chicken salad sandwich?

279
00:16:20,153 --> 00:16:21,955
Certainly one example.

280
00:16:21,988 --> 00:16:25,157
<i>Or like when you're having a good
belly laugh watching reruns of Friends,</i>

281
00:16:25,158 --> 00:16:27,592
and they throw in some
tearjerker with Ross and Rachel,

282
00:16:27,626 --> 00:16:30,796
and they remix the theme song
to sound all sad and slow and sappy?

283
00:16:32,065 --> 00:16:33,365
Exactly what I was thinking.

284
00:16:33,932 --> 00:16:35,232
You're on a roll.

285
00:16:36,702 --> 00:16:39,354
Or like when they take
an honorable profession like stripping

286
00:16:39,371 --> 00:16:42,541
and mix it all up with
gangsters and crooked businessmen?

287
00:16:46,613 --> 00:16:48,681
Are you a mind reader,
Fontaine?

288
00:16:48,714 --> 00:16:50,783
I told you it's
the family business.

289
00:16:50,817 --> 00:16:53,720
You thought I was lying,
but I know how these things work.

290
00:16:57,723 --> 00:16:59,549
Are those boys at
the club threatening you?

291
00:17:02,060 --> 00:17:03,538
Do I need to do
something about it?

292
00:17:08,134 --> 00:17:11,137
I think that's out of
your jurisdiction.

293
00:17:14,473 --> 00:17:16,576
Are you taking applications?

294
00:17:16,608 --> 00:17:18,912
Maybe I should quit
dancing and become a park ranger.

295
00:17:19,578 --> 00:17:21,480
You'd have to wear
this snazzy uniform.

296
00:17:21,513 --> 00:17:23,034
You sure you can
keep it on all day?

297
00:17:26,618 --> 00:17:27,918
Yep, what about you?

298
00:17:33,125 --> 00:17:36,494
I don't even like nature, but with all
the shit waiting for me down there,

299
00:17:36,528 --> 00:17:40,967
I think that I could
probably stay up here forever.

300
00:17:41,999 --> 00:17:44,259
I'd be happy to write you
a letter of recommendation.

301
00:17:45,171 --> 00:17:46,471
I'm serious. I'll do it.

302
00:17:47,641 --> 00:17:48,975
You sure now?

303
00:17:49,009 --> 00:17:50,208
'Cause once I get
my marching orders,

304
00:17:50,209 --> 00:17:51,509
there ain't no calling me off.

305
00:17:54,547 --> 00:17:56,082
Hmm.

306
00:17:56,083 --> 00:17:57,616
Life's little
possibilities, eh?

307
00:17:59,519 --> 00:18:01,620
Do you mind if I tell you
that you are about the most

308
00:18:01,621 --> 00:18:03,523
beautiful girl on
God's green earth?

309
00:18:05,325 --> 00:18:07,693
No, not at all.

310
00:18:09,961 --> 00:18:13,732
My mom used to say the exact same thing
to me and it feels nice to hear it again.

311
00:18:13,766 --> 00:18:15,201
Did your mom pass on?

312
00:18:15,234 --> 00:18:17,136
No, no, no,
she's alive and well.

313
00:18:17,170 --> 00:18:18,804
She just stopped saying
that kind of thing to me

314
00:18:18,805 --> 00:18:22,173
around the time that I
outgrew my training bra.

315
00:18:22,208 --> 00:18:26,880
The ones that love us the most
sometimes forget how to say it.

316
00:18:27,846 --> 00:18:31,283
Yeah, it was probably
just the booze talking.

317
00:18:31,317 --> 00:18:33,251
Or not talking...

318
00:18:33,286 --> 00:18:36,288
My dad struggled on
and off with the potion too.

319
00:18:36,321 --> 00:18:38,290
I never touch it myself.

320
00:18:38,959 --> 00:18:40,727
Me neither.

321
00:18:40,759 --> 00:18:45,597
But I have been known on
occasion to let it touch me.

322
00:18:45,632 --> 00:18:47,333
Womp-womp-womp...

323
00:18:47,366 --> 00:18:50,470
All right, now you got
the pep back in your step.

324
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:57,144
We've said a lot,
you've seen a lot.

325
00:18:57,777 --> 00:18:59,712
Yeah.

326
00:19:01,614 --> 00:19:04,718
I should probably go look
for my friend though.

327
00:19:05,417 --> 00:19:07,152
It was nice meeting you.

328
00:19:07,185 --> 00:19:09,221
Well, the pleasure was
all mine, Miss Dorothy.

329
00:19:09,255 --> 00:19:12,024
And I do hope your troubles
disappear on you.

330
00:19:12,057 --> 00:19:17,363
Yeah well, like everyone's
damn grandmother says,

331
00:19:17,395 --> 00:19:19,632
"It will all work out for
the best in the end."

332
00:19:19,665 --> 00:19:24,470
Well that certainly is one way of looking
at things, but it's not the only way.

333
00:19:57,737 --> 00:20:04,544
So I ask to use his bathroom and I see he's
got a case of Wet Ones on top of the toilet.

334
00:20:05,912 --> 00:20:07,011
So?

335
00:20:07,012 --> 00:20:09,715
So, what is he
a baby or something?

336
00:20:12,018 --> 00:20:13,419
Let me ask you something.

337
00:20:13,451 --> 00:20:16,021
If someone smeared shit
on your forearm,

338
00:20:16,055 --> 00:20:18,324
and you used a dry paper
towel to wipe it up,

339
00:20:18,357 --> 00:20:20,759
would you consider
your arm to be clean?

340
00:20:22,827 --> 00:20:24,363
I don't know.

341
00:20:24,396 --> 00:20:27,500
So I take it this means
you don't use Wet Ones.

342
00:20:29,234 --> 00:20:30,703
Oh, Jesus Christ.

343
00:20:32,172 --> 00:20:33,673
What happened?

344
00:20:34,839 --> 00:20:36,139
Hey?

345
00:20:36,308 --> 00:20:37,608
Chick!

346
00:20:39,211 --> 00:20:41,014
Go see if she's okay.

347
00:20:53,926 --> 00:20:55,260
She's not breathing.

348
00:20:55,295 --> 00:20:57,028
Oh, Jesus Christ,
you fucking killed her.

349
00:20:57,029 --> 00:20:58,397
What?

350
00:20:58,431 --> 00:21:00,298
They can't blame us
if she O.D.'d.

351
00:21:00,333 --> 00:21:01,634
Whoa, whoa.

352
00:21:01,667 --> 00:21:04,402
You're the one that gave
her the dose, okay, not me.

353
00:21:04,436 --> 00:21:05,670
She only took one.

354
00:21:05,671 --> 00:21:07,405
You mixed up the last batch.

355
00:21:07,439 --> 00:21:09,642
Who knows what the
fuck you put in it.

356
00:21:09,674 --> 00:21:11,442
I let her use my phone.

357
00:21:11,477 --> 00:21:12,778
They can trace that shit.

358
00:21:12,811 --> 00:21:15,214
I told you to get
a fucking burner.

359
00:21:15,248 --> 00:21:16,649
<i>Don't you watch The Wire?</i>

360
00:21:16,682 --> 00:21:18,416
I can't afford HBO!

361
00:21:18,451 --> 00:21:20,819
Jesus, Matthew,
what are we gonna do?

362
00:21:20,853 --> 00:21:22,689
I don't know.

363
00:21:23,789 --> 00:21:25,557
Why are you smiling?

364
00:21:26,357 --> 00:21:28,793
I... I can't help it.

365
00:21:28,826 --> 00:21:31,364
It's a natural reaction
to this kind of thing.

366
00:21:31,396 --> 00:21:33,298
It can happen to anybody.

367
00:21:33,333 --> 00:21:34,968
Holy shit.

368
00:21:35,999 --> 00:21:37,134
Holy shit, you
fucking killed her!

369
00:21:37,135 --> 00:21:38,435
Oh God.

370
00:21:38,438 --> 00:21:41,174
Come on, let's get
the fuck out of here!

371
00:23:34,653 --> 00:23:35,954
Woo-hoo!

372
00:23:35,988 --> 00:23:37,355
Hi boys.

373
00:23:37,390 --> 00:23:39,025
Well look at you.

374
00:23:39,959 --> 00:23:41,125
Whoa!

375
00:23:41,126 --> 00:23:42,628
What are you doing, Janet?

376
00:23:42,662 --> 00:23:44,529
I'm just getting
ready for tonight.

377
00:23:44,564 --> 00:23:45,998
Do you like it?

378
00:23:46,030 --> 00:23:48,433
I think you're
a little overdressed.

379
00:23:48,468 --> 00:23:51,204
Uh, this isn't
a prom sweetheart.

380
00:23:53,271 --> 00:23:55,974
I was just trying to look nice.

381
00:23:56,008 --> 00:23:59,478
I don't think this is the
right thing for the occasion.

382
00:23:59,511 --> 00:24:01,780
Veronica, what are you
wearing tonight, darling?

383
00:24:03,281 --> 00:24:04,581
Slacks.

384
00:24:05,050 --> 00:24:06,585
See that sweetheart?

385
00:24:06,617 --> 00:24:08,220
I, I think you'll look
silly wearing this.

386
00:24:08,221 --> 00:24:11,324
Why don't you go in there
and put on some slacks.

387
00:24:11,356 --> 00:24:13,625
I just thought you
would like it.

388
00:24:13,659 --> 00:24:15,995
I don't want everybody
looking at us.

389
00:24:17,329 --> 00:24:18,730
Well, you used to.

390
00:24:18,763 --> 00:24:22,167
That's why you married me,
you always said.

391
00:24:22,201 --> 00:24:25,471
I don't think this is the
right occasion for this.

392
00:24:27,173 --> 00:24:29,275
Janet, why don't you be
a sweetheart, darling,

393
00:24:29,307 --> 00:24:31,411
and bring me another one
of these gimlets?

394
00:24:32,077 --> 00:24:33,377
Okay.

395
00:24:34,547 --> 00:24:36,516
Nothing for me, darling.

396
00:24:39,585 --> 00:24:45,491
There's a way to look nice and then
there's a way to look appropriate, Janet.

397
00:24:49,728 --> 00:24:52,632
You can't blame her
for trying, but Jesus.

398
00:24:54,098 --> 00:24:56,634
As long as she keeps
making these pastelillos,

399
00:24:56,669 --> 00:24:59,138
hell, she can wear a feather
in her cap for all I care.

400
00:24:59,171 --> 00:25:01,640
I can't think of the last time
I had a home cooked meal,

401
00:25:01,673 --> 00:25:05,510
much less a few of these
"whore's devours."

402
00:25:05,545 --> 00:25:07,012
I made Pot Buds last night.

403
00:25:07,046 --> 00:25:08,780
Oh, that's right you did.

404
00:25:08,815 --> 00:25:11,317
And I added the gorgonzola
and the prosciutto

405
00:25:11,349 --> 00:25:15,020
and all that other stuff that
makes those damn things edible.

406
00:25:16,020 --> 00:25:18,589
Kraft Dinner and Potato Buds.

407
00:25:18,624 --> 00:25:22,394
Now those are her two favorites
and her two best dishes.

408
00:25:22,428 --> 00:25:24,096
As long as it comes
in a cardboard box...

409
00:25:24,128 --> 00:25:26,765
These are the sacrifices
we make Roger.

410
00:25:26,798 --> 00:25:29,602
Maybe if she got out
of bed one day before noon

411
00:25:29,635 --> 00:25:32,937
I might be feasting on
Cream of Wheat, who knows?

412
00:25:32,971 --> 00:25:35,007
Would you light me one
of your cigarettes?

413
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:36,575
Those ain't my cigarettes.

414
00:25:36,608 --> 00:25:38,576
Those are yours.

415
00:25:38,611 --> 00:25:40,013
I smoke Smokies.

416
00:25:40,046 --> 00:25:41,278
The originals.

417
00:25:41,279 --> 00:25:43,548
Not these Lil Lil shits.

418
00:25:43,582 --> 00:25:46,284
She won't buy them herself because
she don't want to admit she's a smoker,

419
00:25:46,285 --> 00:25:48,554
so she makes me buy
these little things.

420
00:25:48,586 --> 00:25:50,321
Hell it's like trying to

421
00:25:50,355 --> 00:25:54,225
drink a milkshake out
of one of those little red coffee straws.

422
00:25:54,259 --> 00:25:56,028
I miss my Marlboros.

423
00:25:57,063 --> 00:25:59,298
Suck on that, honey.

424
00:25:59,332 --> 00:26:03,902
We certainly ended up with
a couple of fine women, didn't we Roger?

425
00:26:03,935 --> 00:26:07,773
They're a couple of good girls,
but "ended up" might be a bit premature.

426
00:26:48,180 --> 00:26:50,149
Do you have any tampons?

427
00:26:51,016 --> 00:26:52,986
No, I got my tubes tied.

428
00:26:54,319 --> 00:26:56,955
Why would you do that?

429
00:26:56,989 --> 00:27:00,558
Because Gordy said he didn't
want to have kids.

430
00:27:00,593 --> 00:27:02,996
No, but the next one might.

431
00:28:11,663 --> 00:28:14,834
<i>On human behavior</i>

432
00:28:14,866 --> 00:28:17,670
<i>Are you getting that, Janet?</i>

433
00:28:19,337 --> 00:28:21,572
Would you mind
answering the door?

434
00:28:21,606 --> 00:28:23,009
I have to use the toilet.

435
00:28:40,259 --> 00:28:44,028
<i>I don't know why,
and I don't know how</i>

436
00:28:44,063 --> 00:28:46,798
<i>But she's nobody's...?</i>

437
00:28:49,734 --> 00:28:51,669
<i>There's somebody
at the goddamn door.</i>

438
00:28:51,702 --> 00:28:53,205
Are you fucking kidding me?

439
00:29:08,252 --> 00:29:10,122
"Open the fucking door."

440
00:29:16,028 --> 00:29:18,130
Hello there.

441
00:29:18,163 --> 00:29:20,064
I got into a little car
accident down the street

442
00:29:20,065 --> 00:29:22,021
and I was wondering if
I could use your phone.

443
00:29:24,202 --> 00:29:25,587
Come on in.

444
00:29:25,588 --> 00:29:26,972
Aw, thank you so much.

445
00:29:28,306 --> 00:29:30,175
Can I offer you another drink?

446
00:29:30,209 --> 00:29:31,977
That would be lovely.

447
00:29:32,009 --> 00:29:33,378
I'm Sampson by the way.

448
00:29:35,780 --> 00:29:37,450
The bar's over there.

449
00:29:37,482 --> 00:29:39,283
Everyone's drinking
gimlets today.

450
00:29:39,317 --> 00:29:40,617
Oh.

451
00:29:45,557 --> 00:29:46,792
Can I offer you one as well?

452
00:29:46,793 --> 00:29:48,027
No. I don't drink.

453
00:29:48,059 --> 00:29:49,359
Do you want a cigarette?

454
00:29:49,961 --> 00:29:51,696
Oh, I don't smoke.

455
00:29:52,830 --> 00:29:55,567
Do you want a...
Do you want a painkiller?

456
00:29:56,067 --> 00:29:58,103
Not just right now.

457
00:29:58,135 --> 00:30:01,605
Isn't it a shame when two people
can't agree on a vice?

458
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:03,209
They're not vices,
they're habits.

459
00:30:03,210 --> 00:30:04,777
Oh.

460
00:30:04,809 --> 00:30:06,979
I think habits are
something different.

461
00:30:07,011 --> 00:30:09,280
Like I've got this thing

462
00:30:09,314 --> 00:30:12,150
where every time I get in my
car I flip down the visor to...

463
00:30:12,183 --> 00:30:13,485
That's a routine.

464
00:30:13,519 --> 00:30:14,819
Oh.

465
00:30:17,989 --> 00:30:20,025
Do you, uh... Do you
want some pot?

466
00:30:20,058 --> 00:30:23,628
I think we have a winner.

467
00:30:27,766 --> 00:30:29,066
Hey.

468
00:30:29,934 --> 00:30:33,438
Wow. You have
a lovely home, Mrs. Lyons.

469
00:30:34,906 --> 00:30:38,211
I haven't left this
home in 13 days.

470
00:30:39,611 --> 00:30:42,582
Oh, there's no place like home.

471
00:30:44,549 --> 00:30:45,849
There sure isn't.

472
00:30:47,318 --> 00:30:50,222
Hell, I'd be happy if he just took
me to the damn grocery store.

473
00:30:52,257 --> 00:30:54,460
I'd be thrilled if he
just came home one night,

474
00:30:55,227 --> 00:30:56,695
brought us home a pizza,

475
00:30:56,729 --> 00:30:58,697
<i>rented Iron Man 3 and said,</i>

476
00:30:58,730 --> 00:31:02,267
"Hey baby, howzabout you
and me make a night of it?"

477
00:31:02,300 --> 00:31:04,470
He sounds like a louse.
Why don't you leave him?

478
00:31:06,003 --> 00:31:07,372
You ever been married?

479
00:31:07,405 --> 00:31:09,207
Not that I can recall.

480
00:31:13,244 --> 00:31:15,013
I said, "Till death
do us part."

481
00:31:16,481 --> 00:31:19,084
And apparently there
aren't any vows requiring

482
00:31:19,116 --> 00:31:20,920
dinner and a movie,
so I guess, you know,

483
00:31:20,952 --> 00:31:23,254
technically he's held up
his end of the bargain.

484
00:31:23,288 --> 00:31:25,189
I've got no real reason
not to live up to mine.

485
00:31:25,190 --> 00:31:26,692
That's a bunch of shit.

486
00:31:30,394 --> 00:31:31,694
Maybe.

487
00:31:32,230 --> 00:31:33,530
Maybe.

488
00:31:36,067 --> 00:31:37,403
Where the hell am I gonna go?

489
00:31:38,970 --> 00:31:41,774
I'm too old for
the dating scene now.

490
00:31:41,807 --> 00:31:44,076
You've been too old
since you turned 22.

491
00:31:45,743 --> 00:31:47,579
You're one of those people

492
00:31:47,613 --> 00:31:49,815
that lives their
entire life in the past,

493
00:31:49,847 --> 00:31:52,350
in the future and never gives
a thought to the present.

494
00:31:53,818 --> 00:31:55,520
I know because

495
00:31:57,522 --> 00:31:58,957
I'm one of those people too.

496
00:32:00,258 --> 00:32:01,492
Is that so?

497
00:32:01,493 --> 00:32:02,827
Come run away with me.

498
00:32:04,796 --> 00:32:06,231
I'll take you somewhere new.

499
00:32:11,202 --> 00:32:14,539
You are one of those
hopeless romantics.

500
00:32:14,573 --> 00:32:16,108
That's what you are.

501
00:32:16,109 --> 00:32:17,643
Oh...

502
00:32:17,676 --> 00:32:19,811
I bet you fall in love
with a new girl every day.

503
00:32:19,845 --> 00:32:21,145
No.

504
00:32:24,950 --> 00:32:28,019
Well, there is a girl in the bathroom
over there taking a shit

505
00:32:28,053 --> 00:32:30,589
who will make you
forget all about me.

506
00:32:30,623 --> 00:32:33,424
And I don't make
enough money for you.

507
00:32:33,458 --> 00:32:34,994
That's the real problem.

508
00:32:36,394 --> 00:32:37,495
What do you do?

509
00:32:37,496 --> 00:32:39,865
I own a small business.

510
00:32:39,897 --> 00:32:41,182
Mostly freelance work.

511
00:32:41,183 --> 00:32:42,467
Oh, very specific.

512
00:32:43,368 --> 00:32:45,536
Now you sound like my husband.

513
00:32:45,569 --> 00:32:47,105
He owns a strip club.

514
00:32:48,272 --> 00:32:50,107
I was in love with
a stripper once.

515
00:32:50,141 --> 00:32:51,811
I bet you still are.

516
00:32:52,877 --> 00:32:54,646
I bet she has
a heart of gold too.

517
00:32:56,749 --> 00:32:58,284
You're very pretty, Janet.

518
00:33:01,853 --> 00:33:04,023
Yeah, the boys still
whistle sometimes.

519
00:33:06,892 --> 00:33:08,360
I looked it up.

520
00:33:08,393 --> 00:33:10,740
You still get your period
when you get your tubes tied.

521
00:33:11,997 --> 00:33:13,910
I found your tampons
under the bathroom sink.

522
00:33:22,140 --> 00:33:23,909
I haven't forgotten about you.

523
00:33:29,314 --> 00:33:31,217
Do you still need to
make that phone call?

524
00:33:33,451 --> 00:33:34,751
Yes, ma'am.

525
00:33:35,319 --> 00:33:38,356
Come on. Let's go.

526
00:33:54,038 --> 00:33:55,206
This is Mr. Sampson.

527
00:33:55,207 --> 00:33:57,508
He got himself into a little
car accident down the road

528
00:33:57,509 --> 00:33:58,911
and needs to use the telephone.

529
00:34:00,978 --> 00:34:02,747
Have a seat, Mr. Sampson.

530
00:34:05,483 --> 00:34:06,851
Can I get you boys anything?

531
00:34:06,885 --> 00:34:11,456
I would love another of those
delicious gimlets if you wouldn't mind.

532
00:34:11,489 --> 00:34:12,824
I wouldn't mind.

533
00:34:12,858 --> 00:34:15,260
It's a ritual, by the way.
Not a routine.

534
00:34:15,293 --> 00:34:17,228
The visor thing
I was talking about.

535
00:34:18,797 --> 00:34:20,097
I just thought of it.

536
00:34:24,135 --> 00:34:25,905
Hand him the phone,
will you, Roger.

537
00:34:31,376 --> 00:34:32,676
Sorry about that.

538
00:34:47,525 --> 00:34:49,360
Lieutenant Guercio please.

539
00:34:51,896 --> 00:34:54,799
Jim. Mel Sampson.
I need some law.

540
00:34:54,833 --> 00:34:56,634
I'm at the home of Gordy Lyons.

541
00:34:56,668 --> 00:34:58,702
Address is 73 West...

542
00:34:58,737 --> 00:35:00,438
Ha! I thought you
might know already.

543
00:35:00,472 --> 00:35:02,993
Hurry on over. I've got a murder sign
you can hang on him.

544
00:35:03,007 --> 00:35:05,210
How soon can you be here?

545
00:35:05,244 --> 00:35:07,312
Send some uniforms
over first then.

546
00:35:07,344 --> 00:35:10,248
His dog is growling and
I left my heater in the car.

547
00:35:10,282 --> 00:35:11,582
I'll see you soon.

548
00:35:11,583 --> 00:35:12,883
Don't bother Roger.

549
00:35:13,552 --> 00:35:15,688
So you're the eye.

550
00:35:18,923 --> 00:35:20,826
I'm the eye.

551
00:35:20,858 --> 00:35:23,127
You're very cute,
Mr. Sampson.

552
00:35:23,161 --> 00:35:27,865
Am I supposed to know what that
phone call was in, uh, relation to?

553
00:35:27,898 --> 00:35:29,601
I don't expect you to.

554
00:35:29,634 --> 00:35:31,536
I imagine there's
dozens of reasons

555
00:35:31,570 --> 00:35:34,206
the homicide boys would
be interested in you.

556
00:35:34,239 --> 00:35:36,274
Aw, hell, he didn't
call nobody.

557
00:35:36,307 --> 00:35:38,909
He dialed the number
and never pushed talk.

558
00:35:38,943 --> 00:35:41,145
You were on a little fishing
expedition weren't you,

559
00:35:41,146 --> 00:35:42,446
but you didn't catch nothing.

560
00:35:43,748 --> 00:35:45,851
Did you really crash your car?

561
00:35:45,884 --> 00:35:47,186
Sadly, yes.

562
00:35:47,952 --> 00:35:49,120
What do you drive?

563
00:35:49,121 --> 00:35:50,756
1980 Trans Am.

564
00:35:51,923 --> 00:35:53,224
Still, it hurts.

565
00:35:53,259 --> 00:35:54,559
It sure does.

566
00:35:55,025 --> 00:35:56,661
Check it out, would you, Rog?

567
00:36:03,635 --> 00:36:05,737
Goddamnit. Ro... Ronnie!

568
00:36:05,771 --> 00:36:08,031
Go on over there and see
if there's a car down there.

569
00:36:29,494 --> 00:36:31,063
There's a car down there.

570
00:36:31,096 --> 00:36:32,328
Is it wrecked?

571
00:36:32,329 --> 00:36:33,665
Yeah, it's smoking.

572
00:36:33,699 --> 00:36:35,134
What did I tell ya?

573
00:36:35,166 --> 00:36:37,634
Well, what the hell does any of
this prove anyway?

574
00:36:37,668 --> 00:36:40,705
Mm, thank you,
Mrs. Lyons.

575
00:36:40,739 --> 00:36:43,374
I'll be inside if you, uh,
guys need anything else.

576
00:36:43,407 --> 00:36:44,742
No, stick around, Janet,

577
00:36:45,943 --> 00:36:48,160
and hear what your husband
really does for a living.

578
00:36:49,414 --> 00:36:51,016
I already know what he does.

579
00:36:52,050 --> 00:36:53,719
Then let's set it to music.

580
00:36:54,652 --> 00:36:56,654
Three days ago,
I stepped in some gum,

581
00:36:56,688 --> 00:36:58,490
and it started me
asking questions.

582
00:36:59,490 --> 00:37:01,726
So I punched some
people in their fat faces.

583
00:37:03,394 --> 00:37:06,097
I threatened various kneecaps
with blunt objects.

584
00:37:06,130 --> 00:37:08,634
On several times
I brandished my revolver.

585
00:37:08,666 --> 00:37:13,337
I spent the pathetic amount of mattress
money I had on bribes and payoffs.

586
00:37:13,371 --> 00:37:15,773
I did these things because
I wanted information.

587
00:37:15,807 --> 00:37:17,275
And I got my information.

588
00:37:18,777 --> 00:37:21,045
And I was certain this
would all lead me to a body.

589
00:37:21,079 --> 00:37:24,048
But the only body I found was
the one I started out with.

590
00:37:25,817 --> 00:37:27,519
A girl named Dorothy Mahler.

591
00:37:29,987 --> 00:37:31,322
And much to my surprise,

592
00:37:31,356 --> 00:37:33,091
you didn't have Dorothy
killed to cover up

593
00:37:33,092 --> 00:37:34,857
another murder or because
she had gone Federal.

594
00:37:34,858 --> 00:37:37,395
You had her killed for the stupidest
fucking reason I've ever heard of.

595
00:37:37,396 --> 00:37:39,664
You had her killed because
she found some Polaroids

596
00:37:39,697 --> 00:37:42,634
of you getting a blow job from
a woman that wasn't your wife.

597
00:37:45,369 --> 00:37:46,537
What is this shit?

598
00:37:46,538 --> 00:37:49,373
Well, that's you.
That's your...

599
00:37:49,407 --> 00:37:50,775
And that's...

600
00:37:50,807 --> 00:37:52,107
Not Janet.

601
00:37:53,545 --> 00:37:57,248
I found some photos like
that once, remember Rog?

602
00:37:57,282 --> 00:37:59,050
Got some diamonds
out of the deal.

603
00:37:59,884 --> 00:38:01,286
They're in a drawer somewhere.

604
00:38:01,318 --> 00:38:03,221
Oh, knock it off, Ronnie.

605
00:38:04,655 --> 00:38:06,692
You boys and your Polaroids.

606
00:38:08,326 --> 00:38:10,762
That's a fascinating
tale, Mr. Sampson,

607
00:38:12,030 --> 00:38:15,266
with some mildly
convincing fabrications.

608
00:38:15,300 --> 00:38:17,168
I'm very curious.

609
00:38:17,202 --> 00:38:21,072
How did you expect to
arrest me without a gun?

610
00:38:21,105 --> 00:38:23,375
Oh I... I didn't come
here to arrest you.

611
00:38:24,576 --> 00:38:26,211
I came here to kill you.

612
00:38:27,612 --> 00:38:30,115
And just how do
you plan on doing that?

613
00:38:30,148 --> 00:38:31,949
I'm going to
strangle you, Gordy.

614
00:38:32,751 --> 00:38:34,987
With my bare hands.

615
00:38:35,019 --> 00:38:38,056
That's a slow
way to kill a man.

616
00:38:38,090 --> 00:38:40,524
I think Roger here might have
something to say about that

617
00:38:40,525 --> 00:38:41,825
before you're finished.

618
00:38:41,826 --> 00:38:44,762
Well to be honest, I didn't
quite plan on Roger being here.

619
00:39:13,391 --> 00:39:14,691
Oh!

620
00:39:20,097 --> 00:39:22,567
Hey Roger, why don't you
go fetch your boss's camera?

621
00:39:22,599 --> 00:39:24,067
I want to remember
the look in his eyes

622
00:39:24,068 --> 00:39:25,570
when I choke
the life out of him.

623
00:39:25,603 --> 00:39:28,639
Oh, hell, Gordy. All this talk makes me
want to paint a landscape.

624
00:39:28,672 --> 00:39:31,142
I always thought you
were a fucking faggot.

625
00:39:31,842 --> 00:39:33,210
I could have lived with that.

626
00:39:33,244 --> 00:39:35,379
Goddamnit, Janet. Point that
some other direction.

627
00:39:35,380 --> 00:39:37,349
All right, Janet, Janet, Janet,

628
00:39:37,382 --> 00:39:42,186
please, Janet, you're
doing my job for me.

629
00:39:42,219 --> 00:39:45,323
Roger, take that fucking
thing away from her.

630
00:39:45,356 --> 00:39:47,189
No, you get up there and
slap it out of her hand.

631
00:39:47,190 --> 00:39:50,194
The most... Worst that would
happen is you get a flesh wound.

632
00:39:50,228 --> 00:39:51,896
I gave up my youth for you.

633
00:39:51,929 --> 00:39:55,500
- Sing it, Janet!
- Roland Emmerich was gonna put me in a movie.

634
00:39:55,532 --> 00:39:56,933
Goddamnit, Roger.
Do something!

635
00:39:56,967 --> 00:39:58,536
I ain't putting my
hands on no woman.

636
00:39:58,570 --> 00:40:01,673
No, sure, you'll just
send your son Skippy to do it for you.

637
00:40:01,706 --> 00:40:03,907
- You better watch your step, boy.
- You know what, sweetheart?

638
00:40:03,942 --> 00:40:05,343
Shoot Roger too
while you're at it.

639
00:40:05,344 --> 00:40:06,711
You said...

640
00:40:06,744 --> 00:40:11,682
You said you were gonna
whisk me away like the Prince of Monaco.

641
00:40:11,715 --> 00:40:13,015
That's a fine son
you've got, Roger.

642
00:40:13,016 --> 00:40:14,652
You teach him to play baseball

643
00:40:14,686 --> 00:40:17,222
and ride a bike and
maybe snap a neck?

644
00:40:17,255 --> 00:40:18,990
I made a mistake, Janet.

645
00:40:19,023 --> 00:40:20,557
It happened years ago.

646
00:40:20,590 --> 00:40:22,126
When I was your age, boy,

647
00:40:22,159 --> 00:40:25,663
I was snapping three necks a week
for a buck twenty-five an hour.

648
00:40:26,898 --> 00:40:28,198
Let me guess, Gordy.

649
00:40:28,967 --> 00:40:31,170
It was one of the girls
down at the club?

650
00:40:31,737 --> 00:40:33,838
One of those, quote,

651
00:40:33,871 --> 00:40:36,440
"Meaningless inventory items

652
00:40:36,474 --> 00:40:39,544
"that couldn't possibly
interest you at all"?

653
00:40:39,577 --> 00:40:42,814
What the fuck did you think he
was doing down at that club?

654
00:40:42,847 --> 00:40:44,615
Jesus.

655
00:40:44,650 --> 00:40:46,251
Put your pants on
and suck it up.

656
00:40:46,284 --> 00:40:47,584
Sit down!

657
00:40:48,987 --> 00:40:50,287
That's not a goddamn
hair dryer, Janet.

658
00:40:50,288 --> 00:40:52,523
Sit the fuck down!

659
00:40:52,556 --> 00:40:55,993
You ask me for a tampon? You're gonna need
a fucking tampon for your fucking chest!

660
00:40:55,994 --> 00:40:57,762
Janet, listen to me.

661
00:40:57,795 --> 00:41:00,231
Those fucking girls
slipped me something.

662
00:41:00,264 --> 00:41:04,201
They... Viagra or...
Or ecstasy or something.

663
00:41:04,235 --> 00:41:05,636
I was bonkers.

664
00:41:05,670 --> 00:41:07,404
I was out of my mind,
sweetheart.

665
00:41:07,438 --> 00:41:09,839
That ain't the same story you told me
about that Mahler girl.

666
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:12,643
Whoo-hoo. What
a mangled web we leave.

667
00:41:12,677 --> 00:41:15,347
It was just a dumb
girl's mouth.

668
00:41:15,380 --> 00:41:17,648
A place to put it.
It didn't mean anything!

669
00:41:17,681 --> 00:41:20,751
You said she knew things about
some certain business activities.

670
00:41:22,086 --> 00:41:23,922
I have a mouth, Gordy.

671
00:41:24,822 --> 00:41:27,125
I have a heart and a soul

672
00:41:27,157 --> 00:41:30,295
and a mouth and a youth
and it was all yours.

673
00:41:30,327 --> 00:41:32,396
You said she wasn't
gonna stay told.

674
00:41:32,429 --> 00:41:36,000
Janet, you don't know
what it's like to be a man my age.

675
00:41:36,032 --> 00:41:38,237
Things don't work
like they once did.

676
00:41:38,269 --> 00:41:41,672
It... It was
a rare occurrence.

677
00:41:41,706 --> 00:41:44,409
I felt the need to
grasp the opportunity.

678
00:41:44,442 --> 00:41:46,610
You weren't around.
I am sorry.

679
00:41:46,644 --> 00:41:49,012
You said she was going
to bring us all down.

680
00:41:49,045 --> 00:41:50,881
You weren't around, Janet.

681
00:41:50,914 --> 00:41:52,317
It was a practical decision.

682
00:41:52,349 --> 00:41:53,884
Just like having
Dorothy killed.

683
00:41:53,918 --> 00:41:56,019
Sure, all she did was
open the wrong drawer,

684
00:41:56,054 --> 00:41:57,789
but it's much safer
to have her killed.

685
00:41:57,822 --> 00:41:59,323
You didn't say you
wanted her killed

686
00:41:59,324 --> 00:42:02,226
because she saw some photos of
you getting your pecker polished!

687
00:42:02,260 --> 00:42:03,278
That's enough, Roger!

688
00:42:03,279 --> 00:42:04,296
Best to be practical.

689
00:42:04,329 --> 00:42:06,029
Roger's son will take
care of everything.

690
00:42:06,030 --> 00:42:07,632
Snap a neck and
it's all over with.

691
00:42:09,500 --> 00:42:13,003
Should I be flattered, Gordy?

692
00:42:13,036 --> 00:42:14,905
You'd kill an innocent girl

693
00:42:14,938 --> 00:42:17,942
just to spare
my fragile feelings?

694
00:42:17,976 --> 00:42:20,244
Do I mean that much to you?

695
00:42:20,277 --> 00:42:22,980
I panicked. I just didn't
know what else to do.

696
00:42:23,014 --> 00:42:24,414
I... I... Look,

697
00:42:24,449 --> 00:42:26,150
I have never cheated on you,

698
00:42:26,184 --> 00:42:28,686
and I will never
cheat on you again.

699
00:42:28,719 --> 00:42:31,489
And if he does he'll just kill
some more innocent people

700
00:42:31,523 --> 00:42:32,990
so you don't find out.

701
00:42:33,023 --> 00:42:35,426
And why just kill the girl
who saw the photos?

702
00:42:35,460 --> 00:42:38,362
I mean, why not kill the girl
who did the actual blowjob?

703
00:42:38,396 --> 00:42:39,629
I mean, Jesus Christ, Gordy.

704
00:42:39,630 --> 00:42:40,797
It don't make no fucking sense!

705
00:42:40,798 --> 00:42:42,567
Now that is an excellent
point, Roger,

706
00:42:42,599 --> 00:42:44,067
and I'm glad you brought it up.

707
00:42:44,101 --> 00:42:46,337
I've had men killed before.
I won't lie about that.

708
00:42:46,371 --> 00:42:47,489
You shut the fuck up.

709
00:42:47,490 --> 00:42:48,606
It's become routine.

710
00:42:48,639 --> 00:42:50,308
I forgot about
the consequences.

711
00:42:50,342 --> 00:42:52,044
It just seemed like
an easy fix, baby.

712
00:42:53,110 --> 00:42:54,410
Is it easy, Gordy?

713
00:42:56,681 --> 00:42:58,550
I wouldn't know.

714
00:42:58,583 --> 00:43:00,952
Goddamnit, Janet, I am sorry!

715
00:43:00,985 --> 00:43:02,421
Whoa, all right now.

716
00:43:02,454 --> 00:43:05,156
- Oh!
- Okay, I think that takes care of everybody.

717
00:43:05,190 --> 00:43:06,657
Oh, Jesus.

718
00:43:06,690 --> 00:43:07,990
Don't!

719
00:43:30,648 --> 00:43:32,183
I need to change my life.

720
00:44:24,101 --> 00:44:31,076
Oh, man! Get down!
Oh, get down! Hey!

721
00:44:38,248 --> 00:44:41,552
<i>Jilly Bean, move your ass.</i>

722
00:44:41,585 --> 00:44:43,387
There's nobody fucking here.

723
00:44:54,097 --> 00:44:58,635
<i>Coming to the stage next,
spicy and sweet, Cinnamon.</i>

724
00:44:58,670 --> 00:45:00,271
<i>Cinnamon, get your
ass up there.</i>

725
00:45:07,911 --> 00:45:10,013
Hey there cowboy,

726
00:45:10,047 --> 00:45:12,220
would you like to end
the evening with a lap dance?

727
00:45:13,117 --> 00:45:14,135
Not tonight, thanks.

728
00:45:14,136 --> 00:45:15,153
Ah...

729
00:45:17,255 --> 00:45:20,291
Let me tell you what's going to happen in
the next few minutes.

730
00:45:20,324 --> 00:45:23,761
Fifteen other girls are going to come up
asking you the exact same thing.

731
00:45:23,795 --> 00:45:28,166
It's just about closing time and all the
girls want to squeeze in one more dance.

732
00:45:28,199 --> 00:45:30,534
Now if you buy a dance
from Sheila over there,

733
00:45:30,568 --> 00:45:32,403
she'll talk your ear off
about her kids,

734
00:45:32,436 --> 00:45:34,873
child support payments,
her deadbeat ex-husband,

735
00:45:34,905 --> 00:45:38,143
and just about every other unsexy
thing you can possibly think of.

736
00:45:38,175 --> 00:45:40,010
And that one, Rachel,

737
00:45:40,677 --> 00:45:42,246
yeah well, she's got herpes.

738
00:45:42,280 --> 00:45:45,314
And yes, I know you're not going
to get herpes just from one lap dance,

739
00:45:45,315 --> 00:45:47,084
but now that I mentioned it,
you're not gonna be able to

740
00:45:47,085 --> 00:45:48,787
look at her without
thinking about it.

741
00:45:49,186 --> 00:45:50,486
Sorry.

742
00:45:50,922 --> 00:45:53,624
And Cecilia, well...

743
00:45:53,657 --> 00:45:57,362
Actually she's probably
upstairs blowing the boss right now.

744
00:45:57,394 --> 00:46:00,132
And that frumpy little
thing in the corner, eh...

745
00:46:01,498 --> 00:46:04,702
She'll shake her ass about
as sexily as a concrete mixer,

746
00:46:04,735 --> 00:46:06,503
all the while thinking
about getting home

747
00:46:06,536 --> 00:46:09,073
to read Dostoevsky and
play Sudoku with her cats.

748
00:46:10,708 --> 00:46:12,410
What I'm trying to say is,

749
00:46:12,443 --> 00:46:14,746
if you're waiting for
a better offer to come around,

750
00:46:14,778 --> 00:46:16,813
it's not going to happen.

751
00:46:16,847 --> 00:46:18,916
So why don't we spend
a few minutes together

752
00:46:18,949 --> 00:46:22,386
before we each go home and
cross another day off our calendars.

753
00:46:23,086 --> 00:46:24,989
Not tonight, thanks.

754
00:46:27,257 --> 00:46:30,094
I suppose you'd like to sit here
in the back and watch for free

755
00:46:30,128 --> 00:46:31,428
where you don't have to tip.

756
00:46:31,429 --> 00:46:32,596
Would it make you feel better

757
00:46:32,597 --> 00:46:33,964
if I told you I was
near-sighted?

758
00:46:33,965 --> 00:46:36,233
I can see your contacts.

759
00:46:36,266 --> 00:46:38,135
All right, you got me.

760
00:46:40,838 --> 00:46:43,441
- Let's go.
- Oh, no that's not for a lap dance.

761
00:46:43,474 --> 00:46:45,742
That's for your speech, and for

762
00:46:45,777 --> 00:46:47,479
letting me get back
to my Old Grand-Dad.

763
00:46:48,512 --> 00:46:49,812
Fucking asshole.

764
00:46:50,380 --> 00:46:51,915
Pour me a drink.

765
00:46:51,949 --> 00:46:54,251
<i>All right, ladies and gentlemen,
that was Cinnamon.</i>

766
00:46:54,284 --> 00:46:56,320
<i>Let her know. Let her know.</i>

767
00:46:57,355 --> 00:46:58,690
Hey cowboy,

768
00:46:58,722 --> 00:47:01,793
would you like to end
the evening with a lap dance?

769
00:47:02,527 --> 00:47:04,195
God, your eyes are beautiful.

770
00:47:07,164 --> 00:47:08,464
Thanks.

771
00:47:09,467 --> 00:47:11,903
I'm sorry, I've just
never seen them before.

772
00:47:14,871 --> 00:47:16,171
So how about that lap dance?

773
00:47:16,173 --> 00:47:17,473
I'm Mel.

774
00:47:18,443 --> 00:47:19,561
Dorothy.

775
00:47:19,562 --> 00:47:20,679
You don't look frumpy.

776
00:47:20,711 --> 00:47:22,880
Oh, slow down with
the compliments.

777
00:47:22,914 --> 00:47:25,116
I'm supposed to be
the one sweet-talking you.

778
00:47:25,148 --> 00:47:28,085
Your associate over
there called you frumpy.

779
00:47:28,119 --> 00:47:29,554
Oh.

780
00:47:29,586 --> 00:47:32,891
Well that's Jill and
she doesn't like me very much.

781
00:47:32,923 --> 00:47:34,391
I think I just joined the club.

782
00:47:35,291 --> 00:47:36,894
You don't like me
very much either?

783
00:47:36,927 --> 00:47:37,829
She doesn't like me.

784
00:47:37,830 --> 00:47:38,730
Ah.

785
00:47:42,967 --> 00:47:44,268
Are you one of those guys

786
00:47:44,302 --> 00:47:47,239
that likes to strike up
a conversation around closing,

787
00:47:48,438 --> 00:47:51,141
and then wants to continue
it at a coffee shop,

788
00:47:51,175 --> 00:47:53,744
or maybe my apartment or your
apartment or a hotel room?

789
00:47:53,777 --> 00:47:55,077
Does that happen a lot?

790
00:47:56,079 --> 00:47:58,148
I don't let it happen a lot.

791
00:47:58,181 --> 00:47:59,481
But you do let it happen?

792
00:48:00,818 --> 00:48:02,103
No comment.

793
00:48:02,104 --> 00:48:03,387
I'm sorry.

794
00:48:03,420 --> 00:48:04,755
It's none of my business.

795
00:48:06,490 --> 00:48:07,625
Yeah, I guess not.

796
00:48:07,626 --> 00:48:08,759
The answer is no.

797
00:48:08,793 --> 00:48:10,662
- I'm not one of those guys.
- Good.

798
00:48:12,295 --> 00:48:13,529
So how about that lap dance?

799
00:48:13,530 --> 00:48:14,830
Come have a drink with me.

800
00:48:15,766 --> 00:48:18,033
I thought you just said
you weren't one of those guys.

801
00:48:18,034 --> 00:48:19,737
You said those guys
ask you for coffee.

802
00:48:19,769 --> 00:48:21,472
I'm asking you out for a drink.

803
00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:24,674
I don't drink.

804
00:48:24,675 --> 00:48:25,975
Good girl.

805
00:48:27,010 --> 00:48:28,313
Yeah, "Good girl."

806
00:48:30,347 --> 00:48:31,916
Don't tell me
you're one of those

807
00:48:31,949 --> 00:48:34,385
Travis Bickle types
that wants to save me?

808
00:48:34,418 --> 00:48:35,718
No, no. You're
a big girl now,

809
00:48:35,719 --> 00:48:38,422
and I'm not any type.

810
00:48:38,456 --> 00:48:40,091
I'm just trying to be friendly.

811
00:48:43,527 --> 00:48:45,796
People don't come to these kind
of places to make friends.

812
00:48:45,797 --> 00:48:48,536
Oh, I've made life-long
friends in all sorts of strange places.

813
00:48:50,168 --> 00:48:51,468
That's a lie.

814
00:48:52,269 --> 00:48:53,870
I don't think you have
any life-long friends,

815
00:48:53,871 --> 00:48:55,175
otherwise you wouldn't be here.

816
00:48:57,407 --> 00:48:58,707
You're right.

817
00:48:59,876 --> 00:49:01,846
I've let relationships lapse.

818
00:49:05,016 --> 00:49:06,885
I'm sorry.

819
00:49:06,918 --> 00:49:09,153
I... I don't know what's
gotten into me.

820
00:49:09,186 --> 00:49:11,154
I just... I guess all of a sudden I felt
like I could read you,

821
00:49:11,155 --> 00:49:12,557
- but it's not my place.
- It's okay.

822
00:49:12,590 --> 00:49:14,725
I can handle candor.

823
00:49:14,757 --> 00:49:17,227
- Is that what that was?
- It might have been bitchiness.

824
00:49:17,262 --> 00:49:19,064
Okay.

825
00:49:19,097 --> 00:49:21,700
Well, let's split it down
the middle and call it "sass."

826
00:49:22,766 --> 00:49:24,066
Deal.

827
00:49:25,103 --> 00:49:27,037
What do you do
for a living, Mel?

828
00:49:27,070 --> 00:49:28,370
I'm a private investigator.

829
00:49:28,373 --> 00:49:29,874
Oh, a shamus.

830
00:49:31,342 --> 00:49:32,475
Are you working on a case?

831
00:49:32,476 --> 00:49:33,776
Uh, it's my night off.

832
00:49:34,913 --> 00:49:36,581
So you wanted
to spend the night

833
00:49:36,614 --> 00:49:37,983
looking at some naked girls.

834
00:49:40,284 --> 00:49:42,452
I was next door, actually,

835
00:49:42,487 --> 00:49:44,387
listening to my
friend Sally Jaye

836
00:49:44,422 --> 00:49:46,023
sing some songs sung blue.

837
00:49:46,056 --> 00:49:47,403
Only I wasn't
hearing the songs.

838
00:49:47,425 --> 00:49:48,993
I was...

839
00:49:49,025 --> 00:49:51,661
I was hearing Marley's chains
rattling all around me,

840
00:49:51,695 --> 00:49:54,064
and I decided I needed
something new in my life.

841
00:49:54,097 --> 00:49:55,397
Does that ever happen to you?

842
00:49:56,199 --> 00:49:57,734
Sure.

843
00:49:57,768 --> 00:50:01,028
That's how I ended up here wearing
nothing but my First Communion necklace.

844
00:50:04,342 --> 00:50:05,943
Last call for lap dancing.

845
00:50:05,976 --> 00:50:08,346
Where the hell did
you get those eyes?

846
00:50:10,481 --> 00:50:11,883
The usual way I guess.

847
00:50:18,889 --> 00:50:20,407
Sampson, aye?

848
00:50:20,408 --> 00:50:21,925
<i>Yeah, yeah, like
Samson and Delilah.</i>

849
00:50:23,460 --> 00:50:24,628
Your hair's not that long.

850
00:50:24,629 --> 00:50:25,796
Well I'm not that strong.

851
00:50:25,829 --> 00:50:27,129
Maybe.

852
00:50:28,431 --> 00:50:30,434
But you do have a thing
for Philistine women.

853
00:50:35,106 --> 00:50:36,406
Your gun's showing.

854
00:50:37,074 --> 00:50:39,677
I've got a permit for it.

855
00:50:39,710 --> 00:50:42,145
It's not that. It's just not the first
one I've seen tonight.

856
00:50:42,146 --> 00:50:42,997
Yeah?

857
00:50:42,998 --> 00:50:43,847
Yup.

858
00:50:44,949 --> 00:50:46,249
See that guy over there?

859
00:50:48,518 --> 00:50:50,788
Well I asked him if
he wanted a lap dance.

860
00:50:50,822 --> 00:50:52,187
He offered to buy
me a drink too.

861
00:50:52,188 --> 00:50:54,391
And then when I said no,

862
00:50:54,425 --> 00:50:57,227
he showed me the gun sticking
out of his waistband.

863
00:50:57,260 --> 00:50:59,295
Suggested that
I perform fellatio on it.

864
00:50:59,329 --> 00:51:00,764
Why's he still here?

865
00:51:00,797 --> 00:51:03,231
Who am I gonna tell? He's probably
a friend of the boss.

866
00:51:04,034 --> 00:51:05,536
We get all sorts
of seedy types.

867
00:51:05,568 --> 00:51:06,868
Stay here.

868
00:51:14,110 --> 00:51:15,410
Excuse me, ma'am.

869
00:51:15,980 --> 00:51:16,864
Where is it?

870
00:51:16,865 --> 00:51:17,748
What?

871
00:51:17,780 --> 00:51:18,933
Where's the piece?

872
00:51:18,934 --> 00:51:20,085
What?

873
00:51:24,422 --> 00:51:25,722
My mistake.

874
00:51:30,594 --> 00:51:32,112
You know this guy?

875
00:51:32,113 --> 00:51:33,630
Don't worry about it, sweetie.

876
00:51:33,664 --> 00:51:35,432
<i>All right everybody,</i>

877
00:51:35,465 --> 00:51:39,135
<i>this is the last dance,
the last song, and last call.</i>

878
00:51:39,170 --> 00:51:40,154
Hey cowboy.

879
00:51:40,155 --> 00:51:41,137
Not tonight.

880
00:51:41,172 --> 00:51:42,571
<i>Is still calling
on you to make it rain,</i>

881
00:51:42,572 --> 00:51:44,608
<i>so get those singles
out for Cinnamon,</i>

882
00:51:44,641 --> 00:51:47,177
<i>Pony, Rainbow, Dollhouse,
and Dancer Legs.</i>

883
00:51:47,178 --> 00:51:49,713
You have to leave him.

884
00:51:49,746 --> 00:51:51,147
<i>Let 'em know!</i>

885
00:51:51,181 --> 00:51:54,618
He's completely taking advantage
of you and if you don't...

886
00:51:54,652 --> 00:51:56,487
The fuck are you doing in here?

887
00:51:56,519 --> 00:51:57,220
I must be lost.

888
00:51:57,221 --> 00:51:57,920
Sure.

889
00:51:57,954 --> 00:52:00,189
You must have missed
that left turn back in Albuquerque.

890
00:52:00,190 --> 00:52:01,658
Hey Freddie, will you
show this gentleman

891
00:52:01,659 --> 00:52:03,927
how to get the fuck out
of my dressing room?

892
00:52:08,398 --> 00:52:10,667
You embarrass me, sweetheart.

893
00:52:10,701 --> 00:52:12,969
A man doesn't like
to ask for directions.

894
00:52:13,003 --> 00:52:14,605
I can find my way out, Fred.

895
00:52:14,637 --> 00:52:16,673
I saw you found that
better offer as well.

896
00:52:16,708 --> 00:52:18,675
Don't be so hard
on yourself, kid.

897
00:52:19,510 --> 00:52:21,679
Your face is
an acquired taste, but

898
00:52:23,014 --> 00:52:24,314
I'm getting used to it.

899
00:52:28,885 --> 00:52:31,054
<i>We are closing down.</i>

900
00:52:31,088 --> 00:52:33,891
<i>They'll be here tomorrow too.</i>

901
00:52:33,925 --> 00:52:35,793
<i>Finish it and get the fuck out.</i>

902
00:53:48,532 --> 00:53:53,004
Whoo, yeah! Strap me
to the mast, Sally!

903
00:53:53,371 --> 00:53:54,604
<i>Hiya, Mel.</i>

904
00:53:54,605 --> 00:53:56,357
Hey.

905
00:53:56,358 --> 00:53:58,108
<i>Wanna come up
and join us on one?</i>

906
00:53:58,141 --> 00:54:01,044
I think you could use me
more down here.

907
00:54:01,978 --> 00:54:04,014
<i>This is our last song.</i>

908
00:54:04,047 --> 00:54:05,716
<i>You guys have been great.</i>

909
00:54:08,452 --> 00:54:10,120
Hey,
another Grand-Dad?

910
00:54:10,152 --> 00:54:11,087
Yeah, bonded.

911
00:54:11,088 --> 00:54:12,022
All right.

912
00:54:13,289 --> 00:54:17,362
<i>I can't find the moon</i>

913
00:54:18,563 --> 00:54:23,568
<i>In the middle of nowhere</i>

914
00:54:28,771 --> 00:54:33,010
<i>I can't find the moon</i>

915
00:54:34,112 --> 00:54:39,083
<i>In the middle of nowhere</i>

916
00:54:44,088 --> 00:54:47,625
<i>Kind of makes you wonder</i>

917
00:54:47,657 --> 00:54:52,128
<i>What darkness can disguise</i>

918
00:54:52,161 --> 00:54:55,799
<i>When I can't find the moon</i>

919
00:54:55,833 --> 00:54:59,403
<i>In the middle of the night</i>

920
00:55:00,269 --> 00:55:04,275
<i>I can't find the moon</i>

921
00:55:05,643 --> 00:55:10,882
<i>In the middle of nowhere</i>

922
00:55:15,085 --> 00:55:19,423
<i>When I get there</i>

923
00:55:19,456 --> 00:55:23,594
<i>I don't know how I'll get back</i>

924
00:55:23,626 --> 00:55:27,597
<i>Is it better</i>

925
00:55:27,630 --> 00:55:31,335
<i>To want it than to lose it</i>

926
00:55:31,367 --> 00:55:36,673
<i>Once you have it?</i>

927
00:55:40,510 --> 00:55:45,550
<i>There's a motel room
in Amarillo</i>

928
00:55:46,416 --> 00:55:51,989
<i>Waiting for me</i>

929
00:55:56,327 --> 00:56:01,632
<i>There's a motel room
in Amarillo</i>

930
00:56:02,266 --> 00:56:07,572
<i>Waiting for me</i>

931
00:56:11,375 --> 00:56:15,211
<i>It's the only destination</i>

932
00:56:15,244 --> 00:56:19,449
<i>I have in mind</i>

933
00:56:19,483 --> 00:56:26,423
<i>And I can't see nothing
but a train going by</i>

934
00:56:28,057 --> 00:56:31,528
So is that your idea
of what bad guys do?

935
00:56:31,561 --> 00:56:33,063
Ask you to pleasure their gun?

936
00:56:34,297 --> 00:56:35,499
I was thinking on my feet.

937
00:56:35,500 --> 00:56:36,700
It was a dirty trick.

938
00:56:36,733 --> 00:56:38,402
No.
It was a test.

939
00:56:38,434 --> 00:56:41,773
I wanted to see if you were the kind
of guy who would stand up for me.

940
00:56:41,806 --> 00:56:43,624
You passed.

941
00:56:43,625 --> 00:56:45,442
This was a test too,
and you failed.

942
00:56:45,476 --> 00:56:47,142
You shouldn't go out for drinks
with strange men.

943
00:56:47,143 --> 00:56:48,443
I could be dangerous.

944
00:56:48,445 --> 00:56:50,514
I've always had
a natural trust for strangers.

945
00:56:51,715 --> 00:56:53,316
I guess my mom
forgot to give me the speech.

946
00:56:53,317 --> 00:56:54,751
Well, you just got it.

947
00:56:57,353 --> 00:56:58,922
Do you still wanna
buy me that drink?

948
00:56:58,956 --> 00:57:00,291
You don't drink.

949
00:57:00,324 --> 00:57:01,457
Nah, it's a special occasion.

950
00:57:01,458 --> 00:57:03,960
All right, in a minute.

951
00:57:03,994 --> 00:57:05,127
Uh, this is the last song.

952
00:57:05,128 --> 00:57:07,063
How's your dance card looking?

953
00:57:07,097 --> 00:57:08,633
Empty.

954
00:57:14,905 --> 00:57:16,205
Oh, God.

955
00:57:19,742 --> 00:57:21,042
Okay.

956
00:57:26,750 --> 00:57:28,351
Whoa!
Okay.

957
00:57:32,456 --> 00:57:33,925
What are you giggling about?

958
00:57:34,458 --> 00:57:35,992
I'm on drugs.

959
00:57:36,860 --> 00:57:38,161
What are you on?

960
00:57:38,195 --> 00:57:40,130
Ecstasy.

961
00:57:40,164 --> 00:57:42,098
Some of the girls were passing
them around in the dressing room

962
00:57:42,099 --> 00:57:44,235
and I've never
done drugs before, so...

963
00:57:44,969 --> 00:57:46,304
Why start now?

964
00:57:47,704 --> 00:57:49,472
That's a silly question.

965
00:57:49,505 --> 00:57:51,339
Because it's "now"
every time you do anything,

966
00:57:51,340 --> 00:57:53,743
so if everybody always
asked that question

967
00:57:53,777 --> 00:57:56,112
then nobody would
ever do anything.

968
00:57:56,146 --> 00:57:58,215
It would always be too late.

969
00:58:01,085 --> 00:58:02,385
All right.

970
00:58:08,925 --> 00:58:11,261
Mmm.

971
00:58:11,295 --> 00:58:12,246
Are you okay?

972
00:58:12,247 --> 00:58:13,197
I don't feel good.

973
00:58:13,231 --> 00:58:14,765
How many did you take?

974
00:58:16,333 --> 00:58:17,566
I took two.

975
00:58:17,567 --> 00:58:19,401
I didn't... I didn't feel
anything after the first one

976
00:58:19,402 --> 00:58:20,386
so I just took another.

977
00:58:20,387 --> 00:58:21,370
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

978
00:58:21,405 --> 00:58:23,006
Shake and shake
the ketchup bottle.

979
00:58:23,039 --> 00:58:25,409
None will come,
and then a lot will.

980
00:58:28,378 --> 00:58:29,678
You're okay.

981
00:58:32,583 --> 00:58:33,883
Okay.

982
00:58:42,059 --> 00:58:44,461
Um, I can't move.

983
00:58:45,996 --> 00:58:48,731
Can I just stand on your feet
like a little girl

984
00:58:48,766 --> 00:58:51,034
and you can dance for me?

985
00:58:51,802 --> 00:58:53,102
Climb on.

986
00:59:00,543 --> 00:59:02,980
Ooh...

987
00:59:05,148 --> 00:59:05,799
Better?

988
00:59:05,800 --> 00:59:06,449
Mmm.

989
00:59:06,483 --> 00:59:07,783
Okay.

990
00:59:08,152 --> 00:59:09,487
I like this song.

991
00:59:27,070 --> 00:59:29,105
- I kept your business card.
- Mmm.

992
00:59:31,340 --> 00:59:33,577
I'm sorry that
I cried wolf back there.

993
00:59:35,945 --> 00:59:37,681
I swear I'll never
do that to you again.

994
00:59:37,713 --> 00:59:40,884
Ah, you can shout "wolf"
from the rooftops.

995
00:59:40,918 --> 00:59:43,086
<i>You could title
your debut LP Wolf.</i>

996
00:59:43,119 --> 00:59:46,022
- You can name your first-born son "Wolf."
- Hmm.

997
00:59:46,056 --> 00:59:47,557
I'll come running every time.

998
00:59:49,994 --> 00:59:51,329
You're sweet.

999
00:59:55,565 --> 00:59:56,698
Hmm.

1000
00:59:56,699 --> 00:59:58,201
Come on.

1001
01:00:01,505 --> 01:00:02,805
Mmm.

1002
01:00:06,675 --> 01:00:08,112
Quarter to two, guys.

1003
01:00:08,144 --> 01:00:09,478
Noise ordinance.

1004
01:00:09,512 --> 01:00:10,779
Oh, come on, Chipper.

1005
01:00:10,780 --> 01:00:12,065
Them's the rules, Sally.

1006
01:00:12,066 --> 01:00:13,349
Jesus.

1007
01:00:13,384 --> 01:00:14,985
Come on, one more quiet one.

1008
01:00:16,652 --> 01:00:17,886
Come on.

1009
01:00:17,887 --> 01:00:18,989
I'm beat.

1010
01:00:18,990 --> 01:00:20,090
One more, come on, Sally.

1011
01:00:20,123 --> 01:00:21,692
Why don't you play one?

1012
01:00:21,724 --> 01:00:22,826
Not tonight.

1013
01:00:22,827 --> 01:00:23,927
Oh, please?

1014
01:00:23,960 --> 01:00:27,163
Why don't you play that one you were noodling
around with the other night at my place.

1015
01:00:27,164 --> 01:00:28,866
- I don't remember.
- You know. The one when you were drunk.

1016
01:00:28,898 --> 01:00:29,950
Oh, that helps.

1017
01:00:29,951 --> 01:00:31,001
Come on.

1018
01:00:31,601 --> 01:00:32,901
Come on.

1019
01:00:35,672 --> 01:00:39,676
Jesus, you put me on the spot
a little here, Sally.

1020
01:00:41,445 --> 01:00:44,081
Oh, well, here's a piece of it.

1021
01:00:44,114 --> 01:00:45,414
Um...

1022
01:00:46,849 --> 01:00:48,617
I think this is what
you're thinking of.

1023
01:00:50,820 --> 01:00:52,120
Yeah.

1024
01:01:04,235 --> 01:01:07,872
<i>Go back to sleep</i>

1025
01:01:10,974 --> 01:01:15,346
<i>Soon it will be light</i>

1026
01:01:18,514 --> 01:01:19,949
<i>She moans</i>

1027
01:01:21,385 --> 01:01:23,587
<i>And slides down further</i>

1028
01:01:28,425 --> 01:01:31,062
<i>Gotta move your car by ten</i>

1029
01:01:33,896 --> 01:01:38,768
<i>As I lay down with Mary</i>

1030
01:01:41,003 --> 01:01:42,440
<i>Again</i>

1031
01:01:49,112 --> 01:01:50,412
Yeah.

1032
01:02:01,492 --> 01:02:04,995
<i>I close my eyes</i>

1033
01:02:07,331 --> 01:02:11,936
<i>And I have a dream</i>

1034
01:02:17,340 --> 01:02:19,943
<i>And I see her face</i>

1035
01:02:24,148 --> 01:02:26,851
<i>And I wonder when</i>

1036
01:02:29,619 --> 01:02:34,791
<i>Will I lay down with Mary</i>

1037
01:02:36,893 --> 01:02:38,195
<i>Again</i>

1038
01:02:40,664 --> 01:02:43,300
<i>I've got no game</i>

1039
01:02:43,333 --> 01:02:46,269
<i>I got no plan</i>

1040
01:02:50,440 --> 01:02:52,674
<i>But I do what I can</i>

1041
01:02:58,047 --> 01:02:59,347
Yeah.

1042
01:03:04,721 --> 01:03:06,021
All right.

1043
01:03:11,494 --> 01:03:12,795
Not bad, Mel.

1044
01:03:12,829 --> 01:03:16,466
Eh, you know, three chords
and some sap to hold it together.

1045
01:03:16,500 --> 01:03:18,469
That's the secret formula.

1046
01:03:18,501 --> 01:03:19,902
Hmm.

1047
01:03:19,936 --> 01:03:22,139
It was.

1048
01:03:23,739 --> 01:03:26,242
My mom's name is Mary.

1049
01:03:26,275 --> 01:03:28,811
Yeah? A lot of good women
named Mary out there.

1050
01:03:28,846 --> 01:03:31,414
Mmm, a few
of the other kind too.

1051
01:03:32,315 --> 01:03:33,650
Hmm.

1052
01:03:35,318 --> 01:03:36,653
So what happened to her?

1053
01:03:36,686 --> 01:03:37,570
Who?

1054
01:03:37,571 --> 01:03:38,454
The girl in the song.

1055
01:03:39,556 --> 01:03:41,224
Nothing happened.

1056
01:03:41,257 --> 01:03:42,557
I made it all up.

1057
01:03:42,793 --> 01:03:43,926
What?

1058
01:03:43,927 --> 01:03:45,027
That's what happens
when you've got

1059
01:03:45,028 --> 01:03:46,506
no one in your life
to write about.

1060
01:03:47,063 --> 01:03:48,230
Hey!

1061
01:03:48,231 --> 01:03:49,297
Jilly Bean!

1062
01:03:49,298 --> 01:03:50,800
Jesus Christ, Sally.

1063
01:03:50,833 --> 01:03:52,133
You know this guy?

1064
01:03:57,574 --> 01:04:01,610
<i>Please pardon the
interruption while we change reels.</i>

1065
01:04:01,644 --> 01:04:03,847
<i>Due to technical difficulties,</i>

1066
01:04:03,880 --> 01:04:08,117
<i>there will be a forty-five second
delay between each reel.</i>

1067
01:04:21,130 --> 01:04:23,466
<i>I can't let her
stay in this house.</i>

1068
01:04:23,500 --> 01:04:25,135
<i>You won't have
to worry about that.</i>

1069
01:04:25,168 --> 01:04:26,702
<i>She's determined
to leave this city,</i>

1070
01:04:26,735 --> 01:04:29,905
<i>and she wants to get away
as soon as possible.</i>

1071
01:04:29,940 --> 01:04:31,508
<i>I hope she does.</i>

1072
01:04:34,510 --> 01:04:36,313
<i>I hope she can.</i>

1073
01:05:39,409 --> 01:05:41,345
I thought I smelled dick.

1074
01:05:42,512 --> 01:05:44,145
You mean you can
smell with that thing too?

1075
01:05:44,146 --> 01:05:47,183
I thought you just used it
for steam-cleaning shirts.

1076
01:05:47,217 --> 01:05:50,186
You're the last one that ought to be
bringing noses into this.

1077
01:05:50,219 --> 01:05:52,455
Oh, yeah?
What's wrong with my nose?

1078
01:05:52,489 --> 01:05:54,624
Nothing. I'm just still
trying to figure out

1079
01:05:54,657 --> 01:05:58,193
- if it's igneous, metamorphic, or sedimentary.
- Beats me.

1080
01:05:58,228 --> 01:06:01,565
I just remember it's the same type
of rock as your heart.

1081
01:06:01,597 --> 01:06:03,032
Well, that's easy then.

1082
01:06:03,400 --> 01:06:04,700
Igneous.

1083
01:06:04,701 --> 01:06:08,204
It used to be on fire,
but that was a long time ago.

1084
01:06:08,237 --> 01:06:10,406
Didn't you used
to have a heart?

1085
01:06:11,340 --> 01:06:12,710
It's broken.

1086
01:06:15,646 --> 01:06:17,448
Did I do that?

1087
01:06:17,481 --> 01:06:19,249
A long time ago.

1088
01:06:20,516 --> 01:06:22,485
Looks pretty fresh to me.

1089
01:06:30,994 --> 01:06:33,630
I heard you skipped town
with a mute boxer.

1090
01:06:33,663 --> 01:06:35,431
Oh. That.

1091
01:06:36,333 --> 01:06:37,701
The honeymoon over?

1092
01:06:37,733 --> 01:06:40,403
Let's just say we've run out of
things to talk about.

1093
01:06:40,436 --> 01:06:41,871
I'm sure you'll land
on your feet.

1094
01:06:41,905 --> 01:06:43,205
You're looking
handsome as ever.

1095
01:06:43,206 --> 01:06:45,675
I'd say the same about you,

1096
01:06:45,708 --> 01:06:48,744
except there's the small matter of
that beard you're working on.

1097
01:06:48,777 --> 01:06:51,313
Abe Lincoln didn't free
the slaves with a baby face.

1098
01:06:51,347 --> 01:06:53,049
And where did you
get that necklace?

1099
01:06:53,083 --> 01:06:55,050
Mug an eight-year-old girl?

1100
01:06:55,085 --> 01:06:56,853
Dorothy Mahler gave it to me.

1101
01:06:56,887 --> 01:06:58,822
You used to work with her
back at the club.

1102
01:07:00,856 --> 01:07:02,291
Oh, I remember.

1103
01:07:02,324 --> 01:07:04,092
That's probably
not all she gave you.

1104
01:07:04,126 --> 01:07:05,728
I always hated that bitch.

1105
01:07:19,041 --> 01:07:20,576
Oh, damn it.

1106
01:07:25,514 --> 01:07:26,632
Is this your show?

1107
01:07:26,633 --> 01:07:27,750
Yep.

1108
01:07:27,784 --> 01:07:32,289
We run two double features every night
and fights on Saturday afternoons.

1109
01:07:32,322 --> 01:07:34,858
"Boxing" wouldn't be
quite accurate.

1110
01:07:34,891 --> 01:07:38,427
These dumb yokels are cutting into
my screen 2 feature.

1111
01:07:38,460 --> 01:07:40,229
You got a funny way
of laying low.

1112
01:07:40,264 --> 01:07:42,666
Oh. With this face
I never learned how.

1113
01:07:42,699 --> 01:07:44,467
Still, it's not bad.

1114
01:07:44,501 --> 01:07:46,836
It's a money pit.

1115
01:07:46,869 --> 01:07:49,404
I even have to run
the projectors myself.

1116
01:07:49,438 --> 01:07:51,507
Where'd you pick up that trade?

1117
01:07:51,541 --> 01:07:52,643
From a projectionist.

1118
01:07:52,644 --> 01:07:53,744
Yeah?

1119
01:07:54,344 --> 01:07:56,046
What did you teach him?

1120
01:07:57,179 --> 01:07:58,748
The Watusi.

1121
01:08:01,384 --> 01:08:03,753
Are we doing
the jealousy bit now?

1122
01:08:03,786 --> 01:08:05,588
I didn't get the new pages.

1123
01:08:06,989 --> 01:08:09,460
Well...

1124
01:08:11,528 --> 01:08:13,896
Come on. I mean,

1125
01:08:13,930 --> 01:08:16,500
you always said I taught you
everything you know.

1126
01:08:16,533 --> 01:08:19,469
You were old enough
to be my teacher.

1127
01:08:19,502 --> 01:08:22,338
I don't remember any impartin
wisdom to go with it.

1128
01:08:22,372 --> 01:08:26,442
And you were an empty vessel, but
that wasn't wisdom I was filling you with.

1129
01:08:28,778 --> 01:08:31,949
Let's knock it off before one of us
eases into a soft shoe.

1130
01:08:31,981 --> 01:08:33,884
What are you doing here?

1131
01:08:33,917 --> 01:08:35,952
I gotta hang a collar on a guy.

1132
01:08:35,985 --> 01:08:37,003
Here?

1133
01:08:37,004 --> 01:08:38,020
He's right over there.

1134
01:08:43,993 --> 01:08:45,444
What'd this guy do?

1135
01:08:45,445 --> 01:08:46,895
He murdered somebody.

1136
01:08:46,930 --> 01:08:48,332
Anyone I know?

1137
01:08:49,164 --> 01:08:51,201
I don't think so.

1138
01:08:51,234 --> 01:08:53,604
You wanna back me up,
for old times' sake?

1139
01:08:56,840 --> 01:09:01,310
<i>Ladies and gentleman,
after 22 hard-fought rounds,</i>

1140
01:09:01,344 --> 01:09:05,314
<i>the winner,
by technical knockout, is Fred.</i>

1141
01:09:05,347 --> 01:09:07,751
<i>- Come on.
- Please give Fred a warm round of applause.</i>

1142
01:09:07,783 --> 01:09:09,217
I gotta lace up the next reel.

1143
01:09:09,252 --> 01:09:10,953
<i>He fought his heart out.</i>

1144
01:09:10,987 --> 01:09:15,125
<i>Fred, please visit the concession
stand to claim your free popcorn.</i>

1145
01:09:15,158 --> 01:09:18,362
<i>Stick around, fight fans,
for our feature presentation</i>

1146
01:09:18,395 --> 01:09:23,099
<i>of Alan Rudolph's
poignant drama Choose Me,</i>

1147
01:09:23,132 --> 01:09:27,269
<i>starring Keith Carradine,
Lesley Ann Warren,</i>

1148
01:09:27,302 --> 01:09:32,041
<i>and Genevieve Bu... Bujold.</i>

1149
01:09:32,641 --> 01:09:34,043
<i>Bujold.</i>

1150
01:09:40,949 --> 01:09:42,551
You still see Sally?

1151
01:09:42,585 --> 01:09:45,587
Ah, just the occasional
Skype session.

1152
01:09:45,622 --> 01:09:48,325
L.A.'s a bit hot
for me right now.

1153
01:09:48,358 --> 01:09:50,592
What'd you pull back there?

1154
01:09:50,627 --> 01:09:52,762
A failed
extortion attempt, for one.

1155
01:09:53,863 --> 01:09:55,631
I found some pictures
a few weeks back

1156
01:09:55,664 --> 01:09:58,734
of the old boss
getting blown by one of the girls.

1157
01:09:58,768 --> 01:10:01,203
I had an inkling he wouldn't
want his wife to see them,

1158
01:10:01,238 --> 01:10:03,140
so I tried cashing them in.

1159
01:10:03,773 --> 01:10:05,375
Didn't go as planned.

1160
01:10:12,014 --> 01:10:13,783
What happened to the photos?

1161
01:10:13,817 --> 01:10:15,318
Fuck if I know.

1162
01:10:15,350 --> 01:10:17,386
They weren't
where I stashed 'em.

1163
01:10:17,420 --> 01:10:20,590
Maybe I stuck 'em
in the wrong locker.

1164
01:10:20,622 --> 01:10:24,760
All I know is
I got the fuck out of there.

1165
01:10:26,429 --> 01:10:28,699
I wasted a year
of my life with you.

1166
01:10:30,734 --> 01:10:32,903
What else would you
have been doing?

1167
01:10:33,603 --> 01:10:34,903
So much.

1168
01:10:36,372 --> 01:10:38,540
Why are you being
so cruel to me?

1169
01:10:38,574 --> 01:10:40,344
You're a liability, Jill.

1170
01:10:41,377 --> 01:10:43,947
Don't talk to me like that.

1171
01:10:43,979 --> 01:10:46,048
You're the one who taught
me how to shoot.

1172
01:10:53,523 --> 01:10:56,926
I saw an old film noir
at the Egyptian awhile back.

1173
01:10:56,960 --> 01:10:59,229
The tagline on the poster read,

1174
01:10:59,261 --> 01:11:03,332
"When a man goes to the devil,
he usually takes a woman with him.

1175
01:11:03,365 --> 01:11:05,368
"This man took three."

1176
01:11:08,204 --> 01:11:09,538
I need some air.

1177
01:11:44,306 --> 01:11:47,943
Uh, the men's toilet
is full of shit.

1178
01:11:47,978 --> 01:11:49,413
It's taken care of.

1179
01:12:17,873 --> 01:12:23,546
A fella tells me you Asian girls
have sideways cunts.

1180
01:12:24,381 --> 01:12:26,149
I'm only half Asian.

1181
01:12:26,182 --> 01:12:28,184
Mine runs diagonal.

1182
01:12:28,217 --> 01:12:31,188
I oughta wash your mouth out
with some soap.

1183
01:12:34,222 --> 01:12:36,126
What the fuck
are you lookin' at?

1184
01:12:37,126 --> 01:12:38,426
Her.

1185
01:12:38,427 --> 01:12:40,528
That's my wife,
you son of a bitch.

1186
01:12:40,563 --> 01:12:41,998
You're a lucky man.

1187
01:12:42,030 --> 01:12:44,367
Yeah.
She's a bad girl.

1188
01:12:44,400 --> 01:12:46,702
I don't think so.

1189
01:12:46,735 --> 01:12:48,637
But if she is,
I made her that way.

1190
01:12:48,970 --> 01:12:50,272
Ah!

1191
01:12:50,305 --> 01:12:52,541
You must be the white half.

1192
01:12:52,574 --> 01:12:54,677
Or else you've got
a chink dick.

1193
01:12:55,744 --> 01:12:56,978
You lost me, old man.

1194
01:12:56,979 --> 01:12:59,783
Oh please, call me "son."

1195
01:13:02,318 --> 01:13:05,087
Who was that
old cop friend of yours?

1196
01:13:05,121 --> 01:13:07,789
Used to say you had
the Crimson Touch?

1197
01:13:07,823 --> 01:13:11,161
Everything you touch ends up
covered in blood, one way or another.

1198
01:13:11,194 --> 01:13:14,131
Fortunately I've just been
touching myself since you left.

1199
01:13:15,297 --> 01:13:17,033
I'm in trouble, Mel.

1200
01:13:17,034 --> 01:13:18,768
I've had one eye on you.

1201
01:13:18,801 --> 01:13:20,936
I won't let anything happen.

1202
01:13:20,970 --> 01:13:23,039
I can't watch
these movies anymore.

1203
01:13:23,439 --> 01:13:24,739
Every night,

1204
01:13:25,641 --> 01:13:28,411
I see Barbara Stanwyck
or Myrna Loy

1205
01:13:28,444 --> 01:13:31,715
and I think
how beautiful they were.

1206
01:13:33,382 --> 01:13:36,019
Now they're dead,
and it's gonna happen to me.

1207
01:13:36,051 --> 01:13:37,686
Not tonight, it's not.

1208
01:13:38,755 --> 01:13:41,056
You keeping up
with your target practice?

1209
01:13:41,090 --> 01:13:43,059
I don't need practice.

1210
01:13:44,627 --> 01:13:46,863
I shot and killed
a man after we split.

1211
01:13:48,131 --> 01:13:50,801
That would never have happened
if you were still around.

1212
01:13:51,399 --> 01:13:52,935
Maybe not.

1213
01:13:55,371 --> 01:13:57,106
I feel so violent.

1214
01:13:58,341 --> 01:14:00,977
I'm worried for my soul.

1215
01:14:01,010 --> 01:14:03,480
Your soul looks good
from where I'm standing.

1216
01:14:04,479 --> 01:14:06,115
Your aim is true, Jill.

1217
01:14:08,118 --> 01:14:09,986
That's the problem.

1218
01:14:12,121 --> 01:14:13,556
I'm gonna grab a smoke.

1219
01:14:14,090 --> 01:14:15,992
Have one of mine.

1220
01:14:16,024 --> 01:14:18,060
No more Old Hats?

1221
01:14:18,094 --> 01:14:19,427
Ultra Lights.

1222
01:14:19,462 --> 01:14:20,797
Healthy boy.

1223
01:14:21,997 --> 01:14:23,332
Baby steps.

1224
01:14:26,168 --> 01:14:28,637
Don't tell me
this is your heap?

1225
01:14:29,604 --> 01:14:31,639
Don't you like it?

1226
01:14:31,673 --> 01:14:33,576
It's perfect for a man
in your line of work.

1227
01:14:33,609 --> 01:14:35,912
I bet tail jobs are a cinch.

1228
01:14:35,944 --> 01:14:37,813
That never was my forte.

1229
01:14:38,914 --> 01:14:40,750
What happened to the Firebird?

1230
01:14:41,684 --> 01:14:43,853
Crashed it.

1231
01:14:43,886 --> 01:14:46,155
Yeah, I crashed
my Boat-Tail too.

1232
01:14:47,122 --> 01:14:49,725
We gotta slow down, baby.

1233
01:14:49,759 --> 01:14:52,427
Hey, I thought
you only drove American?

1234
01:14:52,462 --> 01:14:57,233
Well, you never know when something
more exotic will come along

1235
01:14:57,265 --> 01:14:59,768
and fall into your lap.

1236
01:15:01,570 --> 01:15:03,672
Jesus Christ.

1237
01:15:03,706 --> 01:15:05,775
- That was fucking terrible.
- Give me a break.

1238
01:15:05,807 --> 01:15:07,444
I'm out of practice with you.

1239
01:15:08,676 --> 01:15:10,447
Whose fault is that?

1240
01:15:26,695 --> 01:15:28,965
You got a gun for me?

1241
01:15:33,036 --> 01:15:34,404
What about you?

1242
01:15:35,805 --> 01:15:38,041
If I have a gun
I'm going to kill him,

1243
01:15:38,073 --> 01:15:40,076
and I'm trying hard
not to do that.

1244
01:15:42,145 --> 01:15:43,780
You ready, Jilly Bean?

1245
01:15:43,813 --> 01:15:45,981
Let's add some horns
to this thing.

1246
01:16:15,612 --> 01:16:18,047
Just keep stuffing
that popcorn in your face.

1247
01:16:18,079 --> 01:16:20,015
There's a gun trained
on you right now.

1248
01:16:25,253 --> 01:16:28,123
Well, you're the girl
who sold me my popcorn.

1249
01:16:28,157 --> 01:16:31,260
That must have been
somebody that looks like me.

1250
01:16:31,292 --> 01:16:34,029
I find that hard to believe.

1251
01:16:34,063 --> 01:16:35,497
Shut up.

1252
01:16:35,530 --> 01:16:38,301
You and I are going for a ride
to the Sheriff's station.

1253
01:16:39,635 --> 01:16:41,938
I haven't had my chewy yet.

1254
01:16:41,970 --> 01:16:45,406
And I get awful angry
if I don't get my chewy.

1255
01:16:45,440 --> 01:16:47,844
You murdered Dorothy Mahler.

1256
01:16:47,877 --> 01:16:49,646
You did it because
your daddy told you to

1257
01:16:49,679 --> 01:16:51,748
and because
you're a psychopath.

1258
01:16:53,515 --> 01:16:55,150
Are you a police officer?

1259
01:16:55,184 --> 01:16:59,322
I'm a private cop,
and I'm bringing you in.

1260
01:16:59,354 --> 01:17:01,822
And you're going to spend the rest
of your life in prison.

1261
01:17:01,823 --> 01:17:04,293
Now that's certainly one way
of looking at it.

1262
01:17:04,327 --> 01:17:06,262
But, uh, it's not the only way.

1263
01:17:06,595 --> 01:17:07,963
Skip it.

1264
01:17:07,997 --> 01:17:09,798
Cuff your right hand
to the wheel.

1265
01:17:12,435 --> 01:17:13,735
I'll take that now.

1266
01:17:13,737 --> 01:17:15,202
Sure you can
trust yourself with it?

1267
01:17:15,203 --> 01:17:16,470
Sure. I've got
my druthers all back

1268
01:17:16,471 --> 01:17:18,239
in the right place.

1269
01:17:18,274 --> 01:17:20,376
You always misuse that word.

1270
01:17:20,408 --> 01:17:22,277
You make a wrong move
I'll shoot you in the kidney,

1271
01:17:22,278 --> 01:17:25,347
then dig the bullet out with
my dirty hands for a souvenir.

1272
01:17:25,381 --> 01:17:26,916
Start the engine.

1273
01:17:27,315 --> 01:17:28,615
Uh-uh.

1274
01:17:32,087 --> 01:17:36,058
It hurts my feelings when you say
I broke your heart.

1275
01:17:36,091 --> 01:17:38,394
It was me that woke up alone
that morning.

1276
01:17:39,761 --> 01:17:41,864
I'm trying to be
a better person, Jill.

1277
01:17:44,167 --> 01:17:46,335
I'll catch you on
the base side, Mel.

1278
01:17:46,368 --> 01:17:48,705
Ah. Projectionist humor.

1279
01:17:50,739 --> 01:17:52,408
Stay sweet, Jilly Bean.

1280
01:17:54,243 --> 01:17:55,543
Let's go.

1281
01:18:30,880 --> 01:18:33,216
Woo!
Woo-hoo-hoo!

1282
01:19:13,956 --> 01:19:15,157
Jesus.

1283
01:19:15,158 --> 01:19:16,892
Hiya, Jilly Bean.

1284
01:19:20,194 --> 01:19:21,462
Oh, God.

1285
01:19:21,463 --> 01:19:23,666
- I'm gonna go call an ambulance.
- Stay with me.

1286
01:19:24,900 --> 01:19:26,685
What happened?

1287
01:19:26,686 --> 01:19:28,470
It's all your fault.

1288
01:19:28,503 --> 01:19:31,039
I was distracted and
he got the jump on me.

1289
01:19:32,073 --> 01:19:33,475
I was thinking about you.

1290
01:19:33,509 --> 01:19:34,608
Don't say that.

1291
01:19:34,609 --> 01:19:37,045
I knew you'd be
the death of me.

1292
01:19:37,078 --> 01:19:39,215
Baby please.
Let me go call an ambulance.

1293
01:19:39,247 --> 01:19:41,384
I want you here with me.

1294
01:19:41,417 --> 01:19:43,253
I don't want anyone
to bother us.

1295
01:19:45,054 --> 01:19:47,288
I've gotta go do
a changeover, baby.

1296
01:19:47,322 --> 01:19:49,823
Otherwise the reel's gonna end
and the screen's gonna go dark,

1297
01:19:49,824 --> 01:19:52,193
and people will get mad
and they'll start looking around.

1298
01:19:52,194 --> 01:19:53,930
And they'll find us here,
and bother us.

1299
01:19:53,962 --> 01:19:56,898
So let me go do that
and then I'll come right back here

1300
01:19:56,931 --> 01:19:58,434
and stay with you, okay?

1301
01:19:58,466 --> 01:20:00,202
I've seen this movie.

1302
01:20:01,569 --> 01:20:03,438
This is the last reel.

1303
01:20:06,208 --> 01:20:08,545
I've missed you for so long.

1304
01:20:10,679 --> 01:20:12,047
Are you my girl?

1305
01:20:12,081 --> 01:20:14,650
I'm your girl.
I've always been your girl.

1306
01:20:14,684 --> 01:20:16,485
But I've been lost, Jill.

1307
01:20:17,319 --> 01:20:19,188
I've been violent too.

1308
01:20:19,220 --> 01:20:20,388
Your soul is good, Mel.

1309
01:20:20,389 --> 01:20:22,659
I know your soul
and it's beautiful.

1310
01:20:23,760 --> 01:20:25,194
Let's make a kid together.

1311
01:20:25,226 --> 01:20:25,994
Okay.

1312
01:20:25,995 --> 01:20:26,762
Okay?

1313
01:20:26,796 --> 01:20:27,980
Okay.
Right now?

1314
01:20:27,981 --> 01:20:29,164
Okay.

1315
01:20:29,198 --> 01:20:30,666
Baby, you've lost
a lot of blood.

1316
01:20:30,698 --> 01:20:32,611
I don't know if I can
get you hard right now.

1317
01:20:39,541 --> 01:20:41,043
We can make a baby.

1318
01:20:42,945 --> 01:20:45,847
And I can teach her
to ride a bike,

1319
01:20:45,881 --> 01:20:48,585
and play guitar, and baseball.

1320
01:20:50,019 --> 01:20:53,256
<i>They have Old School
Sesame Street on DVD now.</i>

1321
01:20:54,355 --> 01:20:57,159
We can show her that
instead of the Elmo shit.

1322
01:20:59,127 --> 01:21:02,631
And I can take her on walks down
to the creek where I grew up.

1323
01:21:05,333 --> 01:21:08,337
But it's not there anymore.

1324
01:21:08,371 --> 01:21:13,208
Sweetheart, you and I would
make the ugliest damn kids.

1325
01:21:16,945 --> 01:21:19,381
This wasn't just
kismet tonight, was it?

1326
01:21:19,413 --> 01:21:21,317
Gordy sent that guy after me.

1327
01:21:21,350 --> 01:21:22,986
He was here to kill me.

1328
01:21:23,886 --> 01:21:25,288
Could've been...

1329
01:21:26,454 --> 01:21:27,957
Stepmother...

1330
01:21:28,990 --> 01:21:30,460
When did you...

1331
01:21:31,327 --> 01:21:32,762
What is that tattoo?

1332
01:21:32,795 --> 01:21:34,364
That's a Jilly Bean.

1333
01:21:36,398 --> 01:21:37,867
Sing to me, Jilly.

1334
01:21:37,899 --> 01:21:39,734
Baby, let me go
call an ambulance.

1335
01:21:39,769 --> 01:21:42,538
Sing me that song you used
to dance to at the club.

1336
01:21:42,572 --> 01:21:44,156
Baby.

1337
01:21:44,157 --> 01:21:45,740
Just that one song,

1338
01:21:45,774 --> 01:21:48,744
and then I promise, I'll let you go
call an ambulance.

1339
01:21:49,545 --> 01:21:51,914
Okay. Okay.

1340
01:21:54,750 --> 01:22:00,488
<i>I said if I'm in luck
I just might get picked up</i>

1341
01:22:00,521 --> 01:22:06,127
<i>I said I'm fishin' trick and you
can call it what you want, girl</i>

1342
01:22:06,162 --> 01:22:09,664
<i>I said I'm wigglin' my fanny</i>

1343
01:22:09,698 --> 01:22:14,503
<i>I raunchy dancin',
I'm a doin' it, doin' it</i>

1344
01:22:14,537 --> 01:22:16,639
<i>Try not to pass out</i>

1345
01:22:18,439 --> 01:22:19,841
Mel?

1346
01:22:21,777 --> 01:22:23,145
Mel?

1347
01:22:24,613 --> 01:22:25,981
Oh, God.

1348
01:22:48,671 --> 01:22:50,405
Hey, we're out of quarters.

1349
01:22:50,439 --> 01:22:53,275
Why the fuck did you change
the price to $7.50?

1350
01:22:57,479 --> 01:22:58,948
Oh, my God.

1351
01:23:02,150 --> 01:23:04,153
Help. Somebody help.

1352
01:23:04,186 --> 01:23:06,087
Somebody help!

1353
01:23:06,122 --> 01:23:09,892
Jesus Christ,
this guy's fucking dead!

1354
01:23:17,632 --> 01:23:20,168
Shake that ass, popcorn girl!

1355
01:23:20,202 --> 01:23:22,204
Shake that ass!

1356
01:24:16,490 --> 01:24:18,527
Oh, would you stop that.

1357
01:24:18,560 --> 01:24:19,794
He's on his way up here.

1358
01:24:19,795 --> 01:24:21,430
Please get dressed.

1359
01:24:21,462 --> 01:24:22,497
I am dressed.

1360
01:24:22,498 --> 01:24:23,532
Oh, yeah right.

1361
01:24:26,034 --> 01:24:29,037
- Are these the only pants you brought to wear?
- Yep.

1362
01:24:29,070 --> 01:24:30,972
Well, will you put them on?

1363
01:24:31,474 --> 01:24:32,875
Dress me, Mommy.

1364
01:24:32,908 --> 01:24:36,846
Oh for heaven's sakes, Mary,
I wish you'd take this seriously.

1365
01:24:37,880 --> 01:24:39,948
I'm excited.

1366
01:24:39,980 --> 01:24:43,951
I think it's about time a couple
of us hens got some dick in here.

1367
01:24:43,984 --> 01:24:45,153
Don't talk like that.

1368
01:24:45,154 --> 01:24:47,190
Well, that's what
they're called.

1369
01:24:47,890 --> 01:24:49,191
"Dicks."

1370
01:24:49,224 --> 01:24:50,726
Do you have any brandy?

1371
01:24:50,760 --> 01:24:52,160
You're supposed
to offer him brandy.

1372
01:24:52,161 --> 01:24:54,463
He's not going to ask for it,
but he will expect it.

1373
01:24:55,997 --> 01:24:59,968
No, Mary,
I don't have any brandy.

1374
01:25:00,002 --> 01:25:03,539
She is your daughter
and all I'm trying to do is...

1375
01:25:08,243 --> 01:25:09,778
Mother, I love you.

1376
01:25:09,810 --> 01:25:15,349
I love you very much
and I promise you, Dorothy's okay.

1377
01:25:15,384 --> 01:25:18,020
She's just... She ran off
with some guy for a few days

1378
01:25:18,052 --> 01:25:19,254
and she's having
the time of her life

1379
01:25:19,255 --> 01:25:22,391
and the last thing
she's thinking about is me and you.

1380
01:25:22,423 --> 01:25:24,292
Now go get the door
for the dick...

1381
01:25:24,793 --> 01:25:26,694
Dick-tective.

1382
01:25:26,728 --> 01:25:30,432
And I promise you
I will be on my best behavior.

1383
01:25:30,466 --> 01:25:34,570
You're just so easy
to fuck with, Mommy.

1384
01:25:36,270 --> 01:25:37,907
All right.

1385
01:25:37,939 --> 01:25:39,540
Would you please get the door?

1386
01:25:39,573 --> 01:25:41,675
I want to be seated
when he arrives.

1387
01:25:41,710 --> 01:25:43,212
Of course.

1388
01:25:45,213 --> 01:25:46,747
God, Mary.

1389
01:25:46,782 --> 01:25:49,051
Thank you.

1390
01:25:49,085 --> 01:25:51,220
Ugh, this damn music.

1391
01:26:05,501 --> 01:26:06,801
Ready?

1392
01:26:08,904 --> 01:26:10,339
Yes, ready.

1393
01:26:14,743 --> 01:26:16,045
Yes?

1394
01:26:16,078 --> 01:26:18,013
I'm looking for Mrs. Mahler.

1395
01:26:18,046 --> 01:26:20,481
I'm Miss Mahler.
May I help you with anything?

1396
01:26:20,515 --> 01:26:22,650
Oh, Mary...

1397
01:26:22,684 --> 01:26:24,519
Would you come in,
Mr. Sampson?

1398
01:26:24,552 --> 01:26:25,685
And don't mind my daughter.

1399
01:26:25,686 --> 01:26:27,789
She's feeling theatrical
this morning.

1400
01:26:34,695 --> 01:26:36,298
Please have a seat.

1401
01:26:36,332 --> 01:26:37,567
Thank you.

1402
01:26:37,568 --> 01:26:38,801
I'm Eleanor Mahler.

1403
01:26:40,168 --> 01:26:43,005
And I can't really say
that I'm happy to meet you

1404
01:26:43,038 --> 01:26:44,606
but I'm relieved
that you're here.

1405
01:26:45,774 --> 01:26:47,942
I understand, Mrs. Mahler.

1406
01:26:47,976 --> 01:26:49,644
Would you care for a drink?

1407
01:26:49,677 --> 01:26:51,314
We're out of brandy.

1408
01:26:52,413 --> 01:26:54,615
I'm fine, thanks.

1409
01:26:54,649 --> 01:26:56,851
I found your name
and your phone number

1410
01:26:56,885 --> 01:26:59,954
in the address book
on my granddaughter's computer.

1411
01:26:59,988 --> 01:27:05,327
Your name was the only entry
inserted in there and, uh,

1412
01:27:05,359 --> 01:27:07,662
it said you were
a private detective.

1413
01:27:07,695 --> 01:27:09,198
That's correct, ma'am.

1414
01:27:10,064 --> 01:27:11,198
How do you know Dorothy?

1415
01:27:11,199 --> 01:27:12,501
We were friends.

1416
01:27:13,368 --> 01:27:15,402
Have you heard
from her recently?

1417
01:27:15,436 --> 01:27:18,239
Well, I should rephrase that.

1418
01:27:18,274 --> 01:27:20,977
We were friends for a night.

1419
01:27:22,077 --> 01:27:24,413
It was several years ago.

1420
01:27:24,447 --> 01:27:25,913
We got along
and I gave her my card

1421
01:27:25,914 --> 01:27:27,382
in case she ever
needed anything.

1422
01:27:27,416 --> 01:27:30,152
Mmm-hmm, I see.

1423
01:27:30,185 --> 01:27:35,891
I see. Well, we haven't seen
Dorothy in five days now.

1424
01:27:35,923 --> 01:27:37,393
Is that unusual?

1425
01:27:38,894 --> 01:27:41,128
Well, she and I
are rather close.

1426
01:27:41,162 --> 01:27:44,331
We typically
telephone once a day.

1427
01:27:44,365 --> 01:27:47,869
And Dorothy never indicated to me
that she was going to be leaving town.

1428
01:27:47,903 --> 01:27:50,005
So when we arrived
in Los Angeles,

1429
01:27:50,038 --> 01:27:53,474
I went straight
to her apartment

1430
01:27:53,507 --> 01:27:57,279
and I saw that she hadn't
fed the cats, so I...

1431
01:27:58,046 --> 01:28:00,649
I snooped.

1432
01:28:00,681 --> 01:28:02,984
Didn't find any clues,
so to speak.

1433
01:28:04,185 --> 01:28:06,688
But her mother thinks
that she's just off

1434
01:28:06,721 --> 01:28:08,757
being young
and falling in love,

1435
01:28:08,791 --> 01:28:11,226
and I don't believe it.

1436
01:28:11,761 --> 01:28:13,095
Why not?

1437
01:28:14,395 --> 01:28:15,831
I don't know, exactly.

1438
01:28:15,863 --> 01:28:19,668
But I... I feel like I know the girl
and it doesn't fit.

1439
01:28:21,604 --> 01:28:23,639
What does your granddaughter
do for a living?

1440
01:28:28,109 --> 01:28:29,478
She's a stripper.

1441
01:28:31,445 --> 01:28:33,081
Did you know that?

1442
01:28:33,114 --> 01:28:35,250
Yes.

1443
01:28:35,283 --> 01:28:38,387
But you wanted to know
if I knew it.

1444
01:28:38,420 --> 01:28:40,822
Mrs. Mahler, this sounds like
a missing person's case.

1445
01:28:40,855 --> 01:28:42,490
Why not go to the police?

1446
01:28:43,557 --> 01:28:46,028
Oh, I...
You know I...

1447
01:28:47,762 --> 01:28:50,265
I love my granddaughter
very much,

1448
01:28:50,297 --> 01:28:52,400
but she's a very troubled girl.

1449
01:28:54,336 --> 01:28:58,240
What I... What I know
about her life is shameful.

1450
01:28:58,273 --> 01:29:02,043
I fear that what I don't
know about her life is illegal.

1451
01:29:02,077 --> 01:29:04,311
And it may sound
corny and pretentious,

1452
01:29:04,345 --> 01:29:07,615
but the Mahler name still draws
water here in this town,

1453
01:29:07,649 --> 01:29:09,585
and I'd like to
keep it that way.

1454
01:29:09,618 --> 01:29:11,520
I see.

1455
01:29:11,552 --> 01:29:16,425
Look, I can write you a check
right now for your retainer.

1456
01:29:16,457 --> 01:29:17,759
What is your rate?

1457
01:29:17,792 --> 01:29:21,929
Thank you but there's no need.
Dorothy was a friend.

1458
01:29:21,962 --> 01:29:23,898
Yes, you mentioned that.

1459
01:29:23,931 --> 01:29:27,536
Even still... I would feel better
paying you.

1460
01:29:27,569 --> 01:29:29,671
I'd like to interview
each of you separately,

1461
01:29:29,704 --> 01:29:32,606
to find out as much
about Dorothy as I can.

1462
01:29:32,640 --> 01:29:34,944
Would it be all right if
I started with your daughter?

1463
01:29:36,043 --> 01:29:37,746
I suppose that's all right.

1464
01:29:37,779 --> 01:29:39,715
Look, I haven't had
breakfast yet.

1465
01:29:39,747 --> 01:29:42,016
I haven't eaten
for days for that matter.

1466
01:29:42,050 --> 01:29:45,753
So I'll just be downstairs in the
restaurant when you're ready for me.

1467
01:29:45,787 --> 01:29:46,471
Very good, ma'am.

1468
01:29:46,472 --> 01:29:47,155
Okay.

1469
01:29:52,260 --> 01:29:53,560
Uh...

1470
01:29:55,630 --> 01:29:57,199
I... I don't know

1471
01:29:57,231 --> 01:30:00,603
what your night with my granddaughter
meant to you, Mr. Sampson.

1472
01:30:03,104 --> 01:30:05,106
It meant a great deal,
Mrs. Mahler.

1473
01:30:08,510 --> 01:30:09,878
Thank you.

1474
01:30:14,015 --> 01:30:15,450
That was very clever.

1475
01:30:15,484 --> 01:30:17,353
- Excuse me?
- I said that was very clever.

1476
01:30:17,386 --> 01:30:19,521
The way you got
rid of my mother. I liked it.

1477
01:30:19,555 --> 01:30:22,758
Friends for a night, huh?

1478
01:30:22,791 --> 01:30:24,726
Ah, that's really cute.

1479
01:30:24,759 --> 01:30:27,227
I think even my sweet, innocent
mother picked up on that one.

1480
01:30:27,228 --> 01:30:28,328
I meant what I said.

1481
01:30:28,329 --> 01:30:29,630
Isn't there
some boyhood fantasy

1482
01:30:29,631 --> 01:30:31,800
about first the daughter,
then the mother?

1483
01:30:31,832 --> 01:30:33,268
I can't remember.

1484
01:30:34,435 --> 01:30:36,137
I, uh...

1485
01:30:38,439 --> 01:30:41,309
I think you have the wrong
impression of me, Miss Mahler.

1486
01:30:41,342 --> 01:30:42,778
Oh, I don't think so.

1487
01:30:43,779 --> 01:30:45,213
Why don't you have a seat?

1488
01:30:45,246 --> 01:30:46,582
Not there.

1489
01:30:50,018 --> 01:30:51,285
I think we should
talk about Dorothy.

1490
01:30:51,286 --> 01:30:52,752
I think you think
I'm a bad mother.

1491
01:30:52,753 --> 01:30:55,791
No. I think you think you're the
one that needs saving right now.

1492
01:31:00,261 --> 01:31:02,797
I don't have a P.I.'s intuition,
Mr. Sampson,

1493
01:31:02,831 --> 01:31:05,900
but I do have
a woman's intuition.

1494
01:31:05,934 --> 01:31:09,237
And whatever it is I need right now,
I think you need it too.

1495
01:31:09,270 --> 01:31:13,307
If you want to call it "saving,"
that's all right by me.

1496
01:31:13,341 --> 01:31:15,076
You're a beautiful woman,
Miss Mahler.

1497
01:31:15,109 --> 01:31:17,212
Don't make me feel stupid.

1498
01:31:17,246 --> 01:31:20,181
I don't throw invitations out
like this every day.

1499
01:31:22,317 --> 01:31:23,584
Come on, let's have some fun.

1500
01:31:23,585 --> 01:31:26,555
I've been cooped up in this box with
my mother for days.

1501
01:31:26,587 --> 01:31:28,089
I can feel the walls
closing in on us.

1502
01:31:28,090 --> 01:31:29,891
- Don't get smart with me, peeper.
- I'm not smart.

1503
01:31:29,925 --> 01:31:31,560
Good.
Then stay dumb.

1504
01:31:32,694 --> 01:31:34,563
I'll show you
where to put everything.

1505
01:31:42,738 --> 01:31:46,509
There's more than one way
to skin the cat that got your tongue.

1506
01:31:52,314 --> 01:31:53,880
What's the matter?
You don't like 'em?

1507
01:31:53,881 --> 01:31:55,317
I've seen them before.

1508
01:31:55,350 --> 01:31:57,051
Not like these you haven't.

1509
01:32:00,389 --> 01:32:01,891
I've seen them before.

1510
01:32:09,398 --> 01:32:11,766
Twenty-one years ago,

1511
01:32:11,800 --> 01:32:14,068
there lived a young man
who didn't know what to do with his life.

1512
01:32:14,069 --> 01:32:16,371
I don't need a bedtime story.

1513
01:32:16,404 --> 01:32:18,738
On a whim, the young man ordered
a correspondence course

1514
01:32:18,739 --> 01:32:22,777
that promised to teach him
how to become a private investigator.

1515
01:32:22,810 --> 01:32:26,814
He would sit in a coffee shop on
Melrose Avenue reading this giant book,

1516
01:32:26,847 --> 01:32:29,015
because he couldn't stand
to be alone in his apartment.

1517
01:32:29,016 --> 01:32:30,784
Yeah? Cool.

1518
01:32:30,819 --> 01:32:32,121
So fucking what?

1519
01:32:33,121 --> 01:32:35,623
One day, the big book
suggested an exercise.

1520
01:32:36,957 --> 01:32:38,759
In order for him to
practice his tailing skills,

1521
01:32:38,760 --> 01:32:41,329
he should pick out
a random stranger and follow them.

1522
01:32:43,399 --> 01:32:45,264
Just then the young man
glanced out the window,

1523
01:32:45,265 --> 01:32:47,468
and he saw a beautiful girl
walk by on the street outside.

1524
01:32:47,469 --> 01:32:49,837
Jesus, would you
shut the fuck up already?

1525
01:32:49,871 --> 01:32:52,305
He left the book behind,
and he ran outside to catch up with her.

1526
01:32:52,306 --> 01:32:54,342
He followed her.

1527
01:32:54,376 --> 01:32:55,809
Of course, she didn't
actually live in Hollywood.

1528
01:32:55,810 --> 01:32:58,636
It couldn't be that easy.
She lived all the way in Newport Beach.

1529
01:33:02,551 --> 01:33:06,021
Regardless, he continued
following her for days,

1530
01:33:06,054 --> 01:33:07,756
and he learned
all about her life.

1531
01:33:08,890 --> 01:33:12,895
But on the fifth day
he got reckless.

1532
01:33:12,927 --> 01:33:14,929
Before he knew it
she was standing right next to him

1533
01:33:14,930 --> 01:33:17,566
at a jukebox, criticizing
his song selections.

1534
01:33:17,599 --> 01:33:19,835
How could I forget
a face like that?

1535
01:33:21,869 --> 01:33:25,873
His cover was blown, and he had no
choice but to embrace the situation.

1536
01:33:25,907 --> 01:33:28,710
He introduced himself
with a fake name.

1537
01:33:28,743 --> 01:33:32,014
He bought her a drink,
several drinks.

1538
01:33:32,046 --> 01:33:34,949
They went back to her apartment and
they spent the night together.

1539
01:33:36,150 --> 01:33:37,718
In the morning, he got dressed
and slipped away

1540
01:33:37,719 --> 01:33:39,454
while she was still sleeping.

1541
01:33:41,389 --> 01:33:43,391
He didn't leave a note.

1542
01:33:43,423 --> 01:33:45,060
She never saw him again.

1543
01:33:45,960 --> 01:33:47,796
You piece of shit.

1544
01:33:47,828 --> 01:33:51,365
The next day, the young man
resumed the tail,

1545
01:33:51,399 --> 01:33:53,168
this time being more careful.

1546
01:33:54,636 --> 01:33:57,873
Over the following months
he watched her body change.

1547
01:33:57,905 --> 01:34:00,140
She grew bigger.

1548
01:34:00,175 --> 01:34:02,378
There had been no other men.

1549
01:34:03,511 --> 01:34:05,613
He knew the child
inside her was his.

1550
01:34:06,113 --> 01:34:07,848
Goddamn you.

1551
01:34:07,882 --> 01:34:10,083
Every day he thought
about going to see her,

1552
01:34:10,118 --> 01:34:12,154
to assume
his paternal responsibility.

1553
01:34:12,186 --> 01:34:15,256
But the girl's family
was quite wealthy,

1554
01:34:15,289 --> 01:34:18,326
and the young man felt he had
nothing of worth to offer his child,

1555
01:34:18,359 --> 01:34:20,062
financial or otherwise.

1556
01:34:22,363 --> 01:34:23,730
The girl gave birth
to a daughter,

1557
01:34:23,731 --> 01:34:25,400
and she named
the child Dorothy.

1558
01:34:27,435 --> 01:34:29,135
He continued to
follow the girl and her baby,

1559
01:34:29,136 --> 01:34:30,537
watching Dorothy
grow up from afar...

1560
01:34:30,538 --> 01:34:33,742
No, no, stop.
You stop this fucking fairy tale bullshit!

1561
01:34:33,774 --> 01:34:35,041
I don't want to hear it.

1562
01:34:35,042 --> 01:34:37,476
Three years ago, the young man was
not so young anymore.

1563
01:34:38,880 --> 01:34:40,582
He was lonely
and full of remorse

1564
01:34:40,614 --> 01:34:42,961
and he went to see his daughter,
who was all grown up.

1565
01:34:44,585 --> 01:34:47,221
He intended to tell her who he was
and how sorry he was

1566
01:34:47,255 --> 01:34:50,324
for abandoning her, even though
he was never far away.

1567
01:34:51,158 --> 01:34:52,359
But when he finally
spoke to her,

1568
01:34:52,360 --> 01:34:54,128
the right words
didn't come out.

1569
01:34:54,162 --> 01:34:57,332
Is this how you were
going to tell her?

1570
01:34:57,364 --> 01:34:59,300
Like you're... Like you're some
Prince Charming and...

1571
01:34:59,301 --> 01:35:01,903
And she and I are
a couple of fucking frogs?

1572
01:35:01,936 --> 01:35:03,770
The man and his daughter
parted ways that night,

1573
01:35:03,771 --> 01:35:06,073
and she still didn't know
who the man really was.

1574
01:35:06,106 --> 01:35:10,511
Stop, stop, I don't want to hear one more
word of this once-upon-a-time bullshit.

1575
01:35:10,545 --> 01:35:14,349
You look at me in the eye and you
speak to me in first-fucking-person.

1576
01:35:16,583 --> 01:35:19,354
Dorothy called me
three days ago asking for help.

1577
01:35:21,523 --> 01:35:23,692
By the time I got to her
she was dead.

1578
01:35:26,394 --> 01:35:28,762
Her body is in
a Los Angeles County morgue.

1579
01:35:28,796 --> 01:35:30,130
Downtown.

1580
01:35:31,350 --> 01:35:32,533
I removed her identification.

1581
01:35:33,268 --> 01:35:35,302
You'll need to identify her.

1582
01:35:35,336 --> 01:35:36,705
She's listed as a Jane Doe.

1583
01:35:36,706 --> 01:35:38,073
You bastard.

1584
01:35:38,105 --> 01:35:41,242
I saved this for you.
Her necklace. I thought

1585
01:35:41,275 --> 01:35:42,643
she might want you
to have it back.

1586
01:35:42,644 --> 01:35:47,949
No, no, you wear it.

1587
01:35:47,983 --> 01:35:50,985
You wear it because your soul is
going to need some religious saving

1588
01:35:51,019 --> 01:35:55,423
after everything that you...
That you've done!

1589
01:36:04,132 --> 01:36:07,668
I needed to buy some time
to find the murderers

1590
01:36:07,702 --> 01:36:09,170
without the cops
breathing down my neck.

1591
01:36:09,171 --> 01:36:11,404
I've found them, and I intend
to kill them right after I leave here.

1592
01:36:11,405 --> 01:36:13,140
I trust you support
that decision.

1593
01:36:13,175 --> 01:36:15,476
I suppose it's the only
parental decision

1594
01:36:15,510 --> 01:36:17,144
we'll ever have a chance
to make together.

1595
01:36:17,145 --> 01:36:19,014
I called you Barry!

1596
01:36:20,582 --> 01:36:22,684
All these years
I called you Barry.

1597
01:36:22,716 --> 01:36:24,217
That's such
a stupid fucking name.

1598
01:36:24,252 --> 01:36:26,454
I bet you got a great
big laugh out of that.

1599
01:36:26,488 --> 01:36:29,124
- No.
- "Oh. If only I could find Barry...

1600
01:36:29,157 --> 01:36:31,893
"If only, if only Barry knew
that we had a child together,

1601
01:36:31,926 --> 01:36:35,364
- "then we could... Then we could be a family."
- No. You seemed independent.

1602
01:36:35,396 --> 01:36:37,031
I didn't think you would
want me around.

1603
01:36:37,032 --> 01:36:41,235
Oh, God, oh, God, you spend a couple
of decades looking into my window,

1604
01:36:41,269 --> 01:36:43,806
and you think
you fucking know me?

1605
01:36:45,907 --> 01:36:48,175
I've been putting money aside
for Dorothy since she was born.

1606
01:36:48,176 --> 01:36:50,145
A college fund or something.

1607
01:36:50,177 --> 01:36:52,779
You can use the money to pay for
her funeral expenses if you'd like.

1608
01:36:52,780 --> 01:36:53,765
I'm going to be sick.

1609
01:36:53,766 --> 01:36:54,750
Why don't you sit down?

1610
01:36:54,783 --> 01:36:56,116
No don't touch me.
Please don't touch me.

1611
01:36:56,117 --> 01:36:57,518
Just get
the fuck off me, please.

1612
01:36:57,551 --> 01:36:59,121
- Just...
- Please, don't touch me, please.

1613
01:36:59,154 --> 01:36:59,972
Come inside.

1614
01:36:59,973 --> 01:37:00,789
Please!

1615
01:37:05,226 --> 01:37:06,361
Get out!
Get out.

1616
01:37:06,362 --> 01:37:07,496
I'm sorry, Mary.

1617
01:37:09,363 --> 01:37:11,265
Get... Get out!

1618
01:37:35,323 --> 01:37:37,392
There you are,
Mr. Sampson.

1619
01:37:37,426 --> 01:37:38,794
I had this thought.

1620
01:37:41,095 --> 01:37:47,269
Dorothy hinted to me that she
might make a trip to San Francisco.

1621
01:37:47,301 --> 01:37:51,738
Now I was thinking, the last time I was
there, my cell phone had terrible reception,

1622
01:37:51,773 --> 01:37:54,640
so it's very possible that that could
explain why she hasn't answered her phone.

1623
01:37:54,641 --> 01:37:55,876
Ok, I'll look into it.

1624
01:37:55,877 --> 01:37:57,198
But I...
Would you check that out?

1625
01:37:57,211 --> 01:37:58,580
I'll look into it.

1626
01:37:58,581 --> 01:37:59,948
Mr. Sampson,
I'm talking to you!

1627
01:39:14,421 --> 01:39:16,457
Hey, you sell looseys?

1628
01:39:16,490 --> 01:39:18,827
- Just give me a deck of Old Hats.
- Yeah, sure.

1629
01:39:22,462 --> 01:39:23,762
Thanks.

1630
01:40:37,171 --> 01:40:39,740
Holy shit!

1631
01:40:39,774 --> 01:40:42,077
Did you see that?
Did you fucking see that?

1632
01:40:42,909 --> 01:40:43,977
He's out cold.

1633
01:40:43,978 --> 01:40:45,712
Yeah.
Of course he is.

1634
01:40:45,747 --> 01:40:47,749
I used a sap.
It's leather.

1635
01:40:47,782 --> 01:40:50,452
If you use a lead pipe or some
shit you can fuckin' kill him.

1636
01:40:51,920 --> 01:40:53,721
Isn't that what we're
gonna do anyways?

1637
01:40:53,755 --> 01:40:55,055
Well, not "we."

1638
01:40:55,823 --> 01:40:57,123
You.

1639
01:40:57,457 --> 01:40:58,558
Why me?

1640
01:40:58,559 --> 01:41:00,328
'Cause I just
fucking sapped him.

1641
01:41:00,360 --> 01:41:01,493
It's your turn.

1642
01:41:01,494 --> 01:41:02,493
Come on, Matthew.

1643
01:41:02,494 --> 01:41:03,229
"Come on, Matthew."

1644
01:41:03,230 --> 01:41:05,833
This is your shitty mess.
It's time to clean it up.

1645
01:41:09,069 --> 01:41:10,738
Let's just get out of town

1646
01:41:10,771 --> 01:41:12,506
for a while until it cools off.

1647
01:41:12,539 --> 01:41:14,886
Why... Why the hell do you
think we tracked this guy down?

1648
01:41:14,908 --> 01:41:16,576
He's a fucking detective

1649
01:41:16,610 --> 01:41:17,877
and he saw you
fleeing the scene.

1650
01:41:17,878 --> 01:41:19,846
He's gotta go.

1651
01:41:19,881 --> 01:41:21,316
We can move to another city.

1652
01:41:21,349 --> 01:41:23,117
Wha... And do what?

1653
01:41:23,150 --> 01:41:24,786
You're a street level
drug dealer.

1654
01:41:24,819 --> 01:41:27,054
They give that job to
fourteen-year-old niggers.

1655
01:41:27,087 --> 01:41:28,855
What are you gonna do
when you can't do that anymore?

1656
01:41:28,856 --> 01:41:30,812
I mean, you literally
can't wipe your own ass.

1657
01:41:32,627 --> 01:41:34,729
I don't want to go to hell.

1658
01:41:36,864 --> 01:41:40,068
Well, you're already going to
hell for killing that girl.

1659
01:41:40,100 --> 01:41:41,785
But I didn't...

1660
01:41:41,786 --> 01:41:43,470
Your after-life
is fucked,

1661
01:41:43,503 --> 01:41:45,773
so you better enjoy
your life while you can.

1662
01:41:45,806 --> 01:41:47,206
And I don't think
you're going to enjoy

1663
01:41:47,207 --> 01:41:49,976
getting your
ass torn open in prison.

1664
01:41:50,011 --> 01:41:52,924
That's why you gotta shoot this
fucker before he catches up with us.

1665
01:41:57,652 --> 01:41:59,886
If this was all a movie

1666
01:41:59,921 --> 01:42:02,490
I could just give the tape
to the cops,

1667
01:42:02,523 --> 01:42:04,324
and they'd understand.

1668
01:42:04,358 --> 01:42:06,895
You're dreaming up some
director's cut that I haven't seen,

1669
01:42:06,927 --> 01:42:09,057
because in the movie I saw,
you killed that chick.

1670
01:42:25,412 --> 01:42:27,214
Holy shit!

1671
01:42:27,247 --> 01:42:29,016
Yeah! You did it!
You did it!

1672
01:42:29,050 --> 01:42:31,253
Oh, shit dude,
you're going to hell.

1673
01:42:32,453 --> 01:42:34,256
Come on. Let's get
the fuck out of here.

1674
01:43:11,158 --> 01:43:12,458
Oh, fuck.

1675
01:43:12,760 --> 01:43:14,060
Ah.
