called it a "Jezebel" spirit.

I wouldn't be caught dead

you as a part of this firm.

00:04:45,619 --> 00:04:48,387
my daddy started this firm with
a thousand-dollar loan

95
00:04:48,389 --> 00:04:51,456
from our
great-great grandfather,

96
00:04:51,458 --> 00:04:53,525
who was a slave hand
in Mississippi.

97
00:04:53,527 --> 00:04:56,428

this firm from nothing.

99
00:04:58,032 --> 00:05:00,232

we're gonna merge

in the state.

00:05:03,604 --> 00:05:05,671
And you know what?

102
00:05:05,673 --> 00:05:08,573
I'm gonna need
a VP of Operations.

103
00:05:08,575 --> 00:05:11,576

00:05:11,578 --> 00:05:14,313
- ... corner office.
- Mmm.

105
00:05:14,315 --> 00:05:16,548
- A bonus...
- Mm-hmm.

106
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:18,283
... and a company car.

107
00:05:18,285 --> 00:05:19,618
You know what
I mean?

108
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:22,154

exactly what you mean.

112
00:05:27,394 --> 00:05:29,494
You know, I am very
fortunate.

113
00:05:29,496 --> 00:05:30,829
I don't mean
to brag or boast

114

the truth around here?

Goodness.

124
00:05:53,854 --> 00:05:56,188
Well, boss, I am here

125
00:05:56,190 --> 00:05:57,489
You know what?

126
00:05:57,491 --> 00:05:58,623
I'm finally looking forward

- Fantastic.
- Yeah.

129
00:06:01,562 --> 00:06:03,128
Listen, she's on her way

130
00:06:03,130 --> 00:06:04,896
and when she gets here,
will you tell her

131
00:06:04,898 --> 00:06:08,667
that I'll be in my office,
working on those merger papers?

132
00:06:08,669 --> 00:06:11,336
- We are on our way, son.
- We're on our way, boss.

134

Did I hear
him say VP maybe?

135
00:06:15,242 --> 00:06:18,910
- Uh, yes, you did.
- No way.

136
00:06:18,912 --> 00:06:22,447
Pretty soon, I'm about
to be ballin', out of control.

137
00:06:22,449 --> 00:06:25,584
Yeah!

138
00:06:25,586 --> 00:06:26,885
Yeah, man,
you could use that, man.

139
00:06:26,887 --> 00:06:28,553
After the year you
just had.

140
00:06:28,555 --> 00:06:31,289
I mean, with the nasty breakup
and your mother passing away.

141
00:06:31,291 --> 00:06:33,525
That was pretty hard on
everybody, you know?

142
00:06:33,527 --> 00:06:34,960
- Yeah--
- You deserve it.

143
00:06:34,962 --> 00:06:36,428
You know,
she broke up with me

144
00:06:36,430 --> 00:06:38,697
a week after they told me
my mother had cancer.

145
00:06:38,699 --> 00:06:39,965
Who would do
something like that?

146
00:06:39,967 --> 00:06:42,667
Whoo, man,
that's cold-blooded.

147
00:06:42,669 --> 00:06:44,603
But she did have some
nice legs.

148
00:06:44,605 --> 00:06:46,271
- I'm just saying.
- Come on, man.

149
00:06:46,273 --> 00:06:48,306
I've been so down
and depressed, man,

150
00:06:48,308 --> 00:06:50,175
I could use some good news.

151
00:06:50,177 --> 00:06:53,879
You know what, you--
you deserve some good news.

152
00:06:53,881 --> 00:06:55,414
I gave that woman
everything I had.

153
00:06:55,416 --> 00:06:59,518
Just out of curiosity, just tell
me, how much did you have?

154
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:01,186
Huh, wouldn't
you like to know?

155
00:07:01,188 --> 00:07:02,721
Yeah, you know what,
I'm glad to see you

156
00:07:02,723 --> 00:07:04,322
finally out of the house, man.

157
00:07:04,324 --> 00:07:07,559
For a minute, I was kind of
worried about you for a second.

158
00:07:07,561 --> 00:07:09,761
You know, to think
that, uh...

159
00:07:09,763 --> 00:07:11,396
through all the pain,

160
00:07:11,398 --> 00:07:13,331
all the hard work
and dedication,

161
00:07:13,333 --> 00:07:15,634
- finally gonna pay off.
- Mmm, that's right.

162
00:07:15,636 --> 00:07:18,170
Studying all those
long law hours,

163
00:07:18,172 --> 00:07:20,405
drawing up contracts
and licenses,

164
00:07:20,407 --> 00:07:21,873
getting Randall's laundry.

165
00:07:21,875 --> 00:07:24,075
Well, actually you had me
getting his laundry--

166
00:07:24,077 --> 00:07:25,610
And to think,
just ten years ago,

167
00:07:25,612 --> 00:07:28,246
I was scraping up money
to buy noodles.

168
00:07:28,248 --> 00:07:31,249
We-- we were scraping up money
to buy noodles...

169
00:07:31,251 --> 00:07:34,553
And now...
I'm in a position to be VP

170
00:07:34,555 --> 00:07:36,555
of the biggest firm
in the state.

171

00:07:41,562 --> 00:07:42,828

Hello, everyone.

175
00:07:42,830 --> 00:07:44,696
I'm Vanessa,

00:07:44,698 --> 00:07:47,566

you guys can call me...

177
00:07:47,568 --> 00:07:48,633
Vanessa.

178
00:07:48,635 --> 00:07:50,068
Oh, Vanessa.

179
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:51,736
Well, how you doing,
Vanessa?

180
00:07:51,738 --> 00:07:54,306
I'm Jarvis, nice to meet you,
it's a pleasure.

181
00:07:54,308 --> 00:07:55,740
That's funny.

182
00:07:55,742 --> 00:07:57,409
Randall has never
mentioned you before.

183
00:07:57,411 --> 00:07:59,377
That's because he's
just a junior attorney.

184
00:07:59,379 --> 00:08:02,180
Hi, I'm Sheila, I do all the
secretarial work around here.

185
00:08:02,182 --> 00:08:05,050
Sheila, yeah, your reputation
precedes you.

186
00:08:05,052 --> 00:08:07,285
I'm watching you.

187
00:08:07,287 --> 00:08:09,354
Oh...

188
00:08:09,356 --> 00:08:11,790
And you must be Elston.

189
00:08:11,792 --> 00:08:14,526
Randall rants and raves
about you.

190
00:08:14,528 --> 00:08:17,496
How intelligent
and dedicated you are.

191
00:08:17,498 --> 00:08:20,465
Are you dedicated to
my husband, Elston?

192
00:08:20,467 --> 00:08:22,968
Absolutely.

193
00:08:22,970 --> 00:08:26,905
( Randall )
Oh, my goodness,
there's my little love bug.

194
00:08:26,907 --> 00:08:28,807
- How you doing?
- Good.

195
00:08:28,809 --> 00:08:30,075
It's good to see you.

196
00:08:30,077 --> 00:08:33,845
Uh, everybody...

197
00:08:33,847 --> 00:08:35,213
... you met my wife, Vanny.

198
00:08:35,215 --> 00:08:36,581
- Yes.
- I guess.

199
00:08:36,583 --> 00:08:39,084
I can't believe you never
mentioned my name once.

200
00:08:39,086 --> 00:08:40,986
- Not once.
- Whatever, whatever.

201
00:08:40,988 --> 00:08:42,988
I don't mean to brag,
but I just want you all to know

202
00:08:42,990 --> 00:08:45,657
she is the ultimate
love of my life.

203
00:08:45,659 --> 00:08:47,893
Oh, you don't need
to pour it on--

204
00:08:47,895 --> 00:08:49,895
You have transformed me

205
00:08:49,897 --> 00:08:51,763
into everything
that I am right now.

206
00:08:51,765 --> 00:08:53,632
And you've made me
whole again.

207
00:08:53,634 --> 00:08:55,500
You already got me, Randall.

208
00:08:55,502 --> 00:08:56,668
- Stop it.
- Yeah, he got you...

209
00:08:56,670 --> 00:08:58,036
right out of the cradle.

210
00:08:58,038 --> 00:09:00,539
So are you working
late tonight?

211
00:09:00,541 --> 00:09:04,109
Um, Vanny,
I wanted to, um...

212
00:09:04,111 --> 00:09:05,944
I wanted to talk to you
about that.

213
00:09:05,946 --> 00:09:08,947
Um, you know with
this big deal next week

214
00:09:08,949 --> 00:09:11,583
I'm gonna be burning
the midnight oil, so...

215
00:09:11,585 --> 00:09:14,319
I mean, is there something you
wanted that we can talk about?

216
00:09:14,321 --> 00:09:16,388
No, just ever since you

217
00:09:16,390 --> 00:09:18,857
came close to making this deal,
I've just been restless.

218
00:09:18,859 --> 00:09:21,059
I've been at home, lonely.

219
00:09:21,061 --> 00:09:22,594
We used to have
more fun than this.

220
00:09:22,596 --> 00:09:26,164
I know, I know, but as soon
as this merger goes through,

221
00:09:26,166 --> 00:09:27,966
I'll have a lot of time
on my hands

222
00:09:27,968 --> 00:09:30,168
and we can pick up
right where we left off.

223
00:09:30,170 --> 00:09:32,804
Yeah, you picked up right from
the school playground.

224
00:09:32,806 --> 00:09:34,506
Sheila, would you...

225
00:09:34,508 --> 00:09:35,674
Vanny, listen,

226
00:09:35,676 --> 00:09:37,776

take the credit card and

buy whatever you want.

Whatever?

Mm-hmm, if you need
my administrative skills

231
00:09:44,451 --> 00:09:47,252

- She was the love
of my life, dude.

your sister.

313

No, you told me I had to go
through with it, okay?

00:12:42,028 --> 00:12:43,528
Nobody could
treat me like Yvette.

- I need my space, okay?
- Yeah.

325
00:12:56,009 --> 00:12:57,475
Now I'm not saying
you gotta go home, bro,

326
00:12:57,477 --> 00:12:58,743
but it's about that time.

327
00:12:58,745 --> 00:13:00,812

- I'll see you at
work tomorrow.

- Nothing personal--

333
00:13:09,990 --> 00:13:11,122
That's how we do it?

334
00:13:11,124 --> 00:13:12,490
- We brothers?
- Let me have mine.

335
00:13:12,492 --> 00:13:14,092
All right, okay,

You're a hot mess,

00:13:36,249 --> 00:13:40,118
Look... what do we
have here?

347
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:42,453
Antidepressants?

348
00:13:42,455 --> 00:13:46,124
Oh, come on, Elston,
you can't go out like that.

349
00:13:47,493 --> 00:13:51,496
Where he at?!
( door slamming )

350
00:13:51,498 --> 00:13:53,097
Well, hello, Raven.

351
00:13:53,099 --> 00:13:54,566
I know that
fool up in here.

352
00:13:54,568 --> 00:13:55,900
I ain't worried about
you, boy.

353
00:13:55,902 --> 00:13:59,003
Where the hell is he at?

354
00:13:59,005 --> 00:14:00,605
( Elston )
I don't know if
I wanna tell you.

355
00:14:00,607 --> 00:14:03,808
You know what, I told that fool
to be home when I get home.

356
00:14:03,810 --> 00:14:06,344
You know, if I step in
that door and he's not there,

357
00:14:06,346 --> 00:14:09,547
well, let's just say, he's
humping for a thumping.

358
00:14:09,549 --> 00:14:12,116
Itching for a whipping.

359
00:14:12,118 --> 00:14:14,118
Jarvis, my candy jar!

360
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:15,887
Where the hell you at?

361
00:14:15,889 --> 00:14:19,390
Lord, Lord, Father...

362
00:14:19,392 --> 00:14:23,228
please, please save me from this
crazy, crazy, crazy woman.

363
00:14:23,230 --> 00:14:25,129
Please, I know you
created her but she is--

364
00:14:25,131 --> 00:14:27,031
Don't make me miss
"Housewives."

365
00:14:27,033 --> 00:14:29,300
Baby, sweetheart, dumpling,

366
00:14:29,302 --> 00:14:30,935
honey pie, sugarfoot.

367
00:14:30,937 --> 00:14:32,437
Um, funny thing
had happened.

368
00:14:32,439 --> 00:14:34,772
I stayed late at the cantina
because I had a bad burrito

369
00:14:34,774 --> 00:14:36,207
and I was stuck
in the bathroom.

370
00:14:36,209 --> 00:14:37,642
Yeah, stuck in
the bathroom.

371
00:14:37,644 --> 00:14:40,778
So, uh, you don't have to be
mad, okay, don't harm me.

372
00:14:40,780 --> 00:14:42,013
Un-uh.

373
00:14:42,015 --> 00:14:43,281
I eat them burritos
all the time.

374
00:14:43,283 --> 00:14:45,617
They ain't never
did nothing to me.

375
00:14:45,619 --> 00:14:48,253
Well, there was that
one time, but...

376
00:14:48,255 --> 00:14:50,255
It was too many damn
people on that bus anyway.

377
00:14:50,257 --> 00:14:53,024
You cleaned out the entire bus
station, Raven, come on.

378
00:14:53,026 --> 00:14:54,058
Boy, shut your mouth.

379
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:55,360
Look here.

380
00:14:55,362 --> 00:14:57,128
I am going to the store
for a few things.

381
00:14:57,130 --> 00:14:59,330
You better be
outside when I get back.

382
00:14:59,332 --> 00:15:02,834
And I mean at attention.

383
00:15:02,836 --> 00:15:04,269
Jarvis,
I ain't got all night.

384
00:15:04,271 --> 00:15:08,840
- Can you pick me
up something--
- Hell no.

385
00:15:08,842 --> 00:15:10,642
( door closing )

386
00:15:10,644 --> 00:15:11,442
( sighing )

387
00:15:11,444 --> 00:15:13,411
You can
come out now, bro.

388
00:15:13,413 --> 00:15:14,946
You sure?

389
00:15:14,948 --> 00:15:16,648
Yeah, it's safe,
come out.

390
00:15:19,318 --> 00:15:21,219
- You sure she gone?
- Man, put
the vase down.

391
00:15:21,221 --> 00:15:22,520
Man, I'm telling
you, man,

392
00:15:22,522 --> 00:15:24,289
I ain't down with that
domestic violence stuff.

393
00:15:24,291 --> 00:15:26,291
I'm telling you, man,
I'm a man, dude.

394
00:15:26,293 --> 00:15:28,259
- You're pathetic.
- I'm pathetic?

395
00:15:28,261 --> 00:15:29,894
- Yeah.
- Whatever, dude-- shoot.

396
00:15:29,896 --> 00:15:32,096
That woman don't know nothing
about no boundaries, man.

397
00:15:32,098 --> 00:15:34,532
I don't know why you
put up with that, bro.

398
00:15:34,534 --> 00:15:37,235
A healthy relationship
has proper boundaries.

399
00:15:37,237 --> 00:15:38,569
Yeah, I know,
boundaries.

400
00:15:38,571 --> 00:15:40,638
Last time I tried to get
some boundaries with her

401
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:42,640
she tried to bind
my hands and my feet

402
00:15:42,642 --> 00:15:44,208
and held me hostage
for four hours.

403
00:15:44,210 --> 00:15:45,743
It was crazy.

404
00:15:45,745 --> 00:15:47,645
Man, y'all are crazy.

405
00:15:47,647 --> 00:15:49,113
Yeah, yeah, we crazy.

406
00:15:49,115 --> 00:15:50,481
I guess
I'm crazy too.

407
00:15:50,483 --> 00:15:52,583
You know what, though,
I ain't gonna lie.

408
00:15:52,585 --> 00:15:54,319
We used to have
something special.

409
00:15:54,321 --> 00:15:56,988
We used to have something...
it was something.

410
00:15:56,990 --> 00:15:58,256
Something...
I just--

411
00:15:58,258 --> 00:16:00,959
Ever since I messed up
that one time,

412
00:16:00,961 --> 00:16:03,528
- she never forgave me for it.
- Yeah, she never
forgave you.

413
00:16:03,530 --> 00:16:04,829
That's for sure.

414
00:16:04,831 --> 00:16:06,764
You know what, women don't--
women are like elephants.

415
00:16:06,766 --> 00:16:08,232
They never forget.

416
00:16:08,234 --> 00:16:10,134
They act like they forget,
but they don't forget.

417
00:16:10,136 --> 00:16:11,436
They be telling you
they forget.

418
00:16:11,438 --> 00:16:13,071
They just want to make
you feel like you forgot

419
00:16:13,073 --> 00:16:14,472
but they ain't forgot
nothing.

420
00:16:14,474 --> 00:16:17,608
- What were we talking about?
- Feel me on this.

421
00:16:17,610 --> 00:16:20,311
- If you can cheat
on your woman...
- Uh-huh.

422
00:16:20,313 --> 00:16:21,746
... how can you
say you love her?

423
00:16:21,748 --> 00:16:25,817
Maybe you don't love her
if you can cheat on her, huh?

424
00:16:25,819 --> 00:16:27,285
- Boy, you know--
- I'm just--
I'm just...

425
00:16:27,287 --> 00:16:29,387
I-I-I-I never
thought of that.

426
00:16:29,389 --> 00:16:30,788
- You know what?
- What?

427
00:16:30,790 --> 00:16:32,256
Give me a minute,
I'm gonna pray about this.

428
00:16:32,258 --> 00:16:34,625
You do that, go ahead,
talk to Him, go ahead.

429
00:16:34,627 --> 00:16:38,296
Jesus... if I don't--
if I cheat on her...

430
00:16:38,298 --> 00:16:39,564
( knocking )

431
00:16:39,566 --> 00:16:41,232
Oh, sh--

432
00:16:41,234 --> 00:16:44,969
Go, I ain't here,
I'm invisible.

433
00:16:44,971 --> 00:16:47,772
This is it, man,
you got a problem.

434
00:16:47,774 --> 00:16:48,840
( knocking )

435
00:16:48,842 --> 00:16:50,375
Hold on.

436
00:16:50,377 --> 00:16:56,047
( whimpering )
Look at you.

437
00:16:56,049 --> 00:16:57,482
( exhaling )

438
00:16:57,484 --> 00:16:59,684
- Surprise.
- Yvette.

439
00:16:59,686 --> 00:17:01,486
- Hey, sis.
- Hey.

440
00:17:01,488 --> 00:17:03,087
I wasn't expecting you
'til next week.

441
00:17:03,089 --> 00:17:04,422
It's Yvette,
how you doing?

442
00:17:04,424 --> 00:17:06,524
Yeah, well, I thought
I'd surprise you.

443
00:17:06,526 --> 00:17:08,292
You know, I had to fly in
to cover the game last minute

444
00:17:08,294 --> 00:17:09,627
with the flu bug
going around.

445
00:17:09,629 --> 00:17:11,396
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
it's good to see you.

446
00:17:11,398 --> 00:17:12,864
You don't mind
if I crash, do you?

447
00:17:12,866 --> 00:17:14,732
Come on, stop it, of course,
I'll get your room ready.

448
00:17:14,734 --> 00:17:15,933
Let me get you something
to drink first.

449
00:17:15,935 --> 00:17:17,068
- Okay.
- What you want?

450
00:17:17,070 --> 00:17:19,404
Um, some water.

451
00:17:19,406 --> 00:17:21,672
- Water it is.
- Yes.

452
00:17:21,674 --> 00:17:24,275
I must say, sis,
I'm pretty proud of you.

453
00:17:24,277 --> 00:17:26,310
Got the new job at
the network, huh?

454
00:17:26,312 --> 00:17:27,478
Oh, thank you.

455
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:28,746
My sister's a
sportscaster.

456
00:17:28,748 --> 00:17:30,348
I've been watching
all your stuff online.

457
00:17:30,350 --> 00:17:32,984
I saw that piece you did on
concussions in the NFL.

458
00:17:32,986 --> 00:17:34,152
Really?

459
00:17:34,154 --> 00:17:36,120
It was pretty stellar,
kind of stellar.

460
00:17:36,122 --> 00:17:37,388
( clearing throat )

461
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:41,159
I've been, uh...
I've been following you too.

462
00:17:41,161 --> 00:17:42,994
Wow.

463
00:17:42,996 --> 00:17:44,529
- Jarvis.
- Yeah.

464
00:17:44,531 --> 00:17:46,998
I didn't expect to
see you here.

465
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:50,701
Well, I should have known
you two are joined at the hip.

466
00:17:50,703 --> 00:17:52,870
Yeah, you know,
I was trying to tell him

467
00:17:52,872 --> 00:17:54,572
about boundaries and stuff,
you know what I'm saying?

468
00:17:54,574 --> 00:17:57,008
A healthy friendship has
good boundaries and stuff.

469
00:17:57,010 --> 00:17:58,543
But he don't listen.

470
00:17:58,545 --> 00:18:01,712
- See a real relationship--
- Okay, you know
what, um...

471
00:18:01,714 --> 00:18:03,614
let me get your bag

472
00:18:03,616 --> 00:18:05,383
and, um...

473
00:18:06,418 --> 00:18:08,486
... you guys can talk.

474
00:18:14,326 --> 00:18:17,328
- How's the weather?
- So...

475
00:18:17,330 --> 00:18:19,297
- Eat your--
- How's--

476
00:18:19,299 --> 00:18:20,731
Sorry.

477
00:18:20,733 --> 00:18:23,334
All right, um, I guess
it's been a while.

478
00:18:23,336 --> 00:18:24,936
Yeah, it's been a minute.

479
00:18:24,938 --> 00:18:26,337
Yeah, yeah.

480
00:18:26,339 --> 00:18:29,373
Look, I'm...

481
00:18:29,375 --> 00:18:30,641
I know I didn't call
and everything

482
00:18:30,643 --> 00:18:32,143
but, I mean
the last time we spoke,

483
00:18:32,145 --> 00:18:34,278
- things kind of ended--
- Yeah, I know,
I understand.

484
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:35,413
It's okay.

485
00:18:35,415 --> 00:18:36,948
I mean, I flew
a thousand miles away

486
00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:41,352
and you didn't find it good to
call me and check on me.

487
00:18:41,354 --> 00:18:43,121
No, "Yvette,
how you doing?"

488
00:18:43,123 --> 00:18:47,558
Or maybe, "I'm sorry."

489
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:52,096
After all this time,
you still can't apologize.

490
00:18:52,098 --> 00:18:53,164
You know, maybe
I should just go.

491
00:18:53,166 --> 00:18:54,499
No, no, no, no,
no, no.

492
00:18:54,501 --> 00:18:57,602
You stay, I'll go.

493
00:19:01,273 --> 00:19:02,974
Yvette...

494
00:19:04,877 --> 00:19:07,278
... I'm sorry.

495
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:08,813
Thank you.

496
00:19:08,815 --> 00:19:10,314
How hard was that?

497
00:19:10,316 --> 00:19:11,649
( chuckling )

498
00:19:11,651 --> 00:19:14,852
I-- I gotta go,
'cause, you know--

499
00:19:14,854 --> 00:19:16,053
Well, give me a hug.

500
00:19:16,055 --> 00:19:17,155
- For real?
- Yes.

501
00:19:17,157 --> 00:19:19,257
Give me a hug,
stop playing.

502
00:19:19,259 --> 00:19:20,892
- For real?
- Stop it.

503
00:19:20,894 --> 00:19:22,226
- See?
- Yeah.

504
00:19:22,228 --> 00:19:24,061
See, we can at least
be friends.

505
00:19:24,063 --> 00:19:25,263
We-- Friends?

506
00:19:25,265 --> 00:19:26,931
I think friends
is a good idea.

507
00:19:26,933 --> 00:19:28,466
I think, yeah, this--

508
00:19:28,468 --> 00:19:30,668
Oh, that feels friendly,
that's friendly.

509
00:19:30,670 --> 00:19:33,137
Oh, yeah, ooh,
yeah, that's--

510
00:19:33,139 --> 00:19:34,205
That's--
( door slamming )

511
00:19:34,207 --> 00:19:35,273
Oh, whoo!

512
00:19:35,275 --> 00:19:37,141
Hey, hi, girl!

513
00:19:37,143 --> 00:19:39,110
Hey, hey,
Yvette run!

514
00:19:39,112 --> 00:19:40,611
How you doing,
baby?

515
00:19:40,613 --> 00:19:44,682
You got the nerve to cheat
on me with a cute girl?

516
00:19:44,684 --> 00:19:48,085
Hello, I'm Yvette,
Elston's sister.

517
00:19:48,087 --> 00:19:49,754
- Uh-huh.
- She cute.

518
00:19:49,756 --> 00:19:53,157
You know what, I should kill
you right where you stand.

519
00:19:53,159 --> 00:19:54,759
After all I done for you.

520
00:19:54,761 --> 00:19:56,794
Wait, it's not like that,
we're just old friends.

521
00:19:56,796 --> 00:19:57,995
Yeah, yeah,
just listen to her.

522
00:19:57,997 --> 00:19:59,530
Just old friends.

523
00:19:59,532 --> 00:20:02,500
Listen here, baby girl, old
friends don't embrace like that.

524
00:20:02,502 --> 00:20:04,435
- That's right.
- You know, my mama
was right.

525
00:20:04,437 --> 00:20:07,305
You can't trust a man
as far as you can throw him.

526
00:20:07,307 --> 00:20:10,608
You ain't nothing but some
two-timing, no-good fool.

527
00:20:10,610 --> 00:20:12,777
Look, we were just--
we just friends...

528
00:20:12,779 --> 00:20:13,811
I'm just visiting-- I'm just
visiting with her.

529
00:20:13,813 --> 00:20:15,813
- Just visiting?
- Yes!

530
00:20:15,815 --> 00:20:17,448
( Elston )
Hey, hey, hey, what's all
the commotion in here?

531
00:20:17,450 --> 00:20:20,384
It's just Raven, you know,
acting out again.

532
00:20:20,386 --> 00:20:21,986
I'm gonna show you
acting out.

533
00:20:21,988 --> 00:20:23,788
You know what--
Take that out of
my house.

534
00:20:23,790 --> 00:20:26,224
- I will see y'all, good night.
- It was lovely seeing--

535
00:20:26,226 --> 00:20:27,725
And you know what?

536
00:20:27,727 --> 00:20:29,927
You stay away
from my man.

537
00:20:29,929 --> 00:20:31,295
We're happy.

538
00:20:31,297 --> 00:20:33,864
Okay, thank
you.

539
00:20:33,866 --> 00:20:37,368
- Good night.
- Close the door
behind you.

540
00:20:37,370 --> 00:20:38,469
Boy, I tell you.

541
00:20:38,471 --> 00:20:39,804
Should we be
calling the police?

542
00:20:39,806 --> 00:20:42,406
No, that's them two
all the time.

543
00:20:42,408 --> 00:20:44,475
Lucky there weren't
no blood.

544
00:20:44,477 --> 00:20:45,977
He'll be all right
in the morning.

545
00:20:45,979 --> 00:20:47,578
Am I safe here?

546
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:48,813
What you mean,
are you safe here?

547
00:20:48,815 --> 00:20:50,648
Big bro got
your back, of course.

548
00:20:50,650 --> 00:20:53,217
Yeah, just like old
times, huh?

549
00:20:53,219 --> 00:20:54,785
- Of course.
- Um-hm.

550
00:20:54,787 --> 00:20:58,522
Mom did always say for you to
look out for me no matter what.

551
00:20:58,524 --> 00:21:00,625
Yeah, she was
always talking about

552
00:21:00,627 --> 00:21:02,693
keeping family first,
huh?

553
00:21:02,695 --> 00:21:04,128
Yeah.

554
00:21:04,130 --> 00:21:07,632
I miss her.

555
00:21:07,634 --> 00:21:10,268
Yeah, not a minute goes
by I don't...

556
00:21:10,270 --> 00:21:12,403
think about
her, you know?

557
00:21:12,405 --> 00:21:14,639
Yeah.

558
00:21:14,641 --> 00:21:17,408
Only God knows why
he needed her up there.

559
00:21:19,177 --> 00:21:20,711
Amen, sister.

560
00:21:20,713 --> 00:21:22,380
♪

561
00:21:22,382 --> 00:21:25,516
- I missed you.
- It's good to see you.

562
00:21:25,518 --> 00:21:27,018
- Are you hungry?
- Starving.

563
00:21:27,020 --> 00:21:28,552
Okay, we need to go
out, sis.

564
00:21:28,554 --> 00:21:34,025
- I have no food here.
- Clearly.

565
00:21:34,027 --> 00:21:35,092
( knocking )

566
00:21:35,094 --> 00:21:39,930
Somebody knocking.
( Yvette )
Yeah.

567
00:21:39,932 --> 00:21:41,565
Hey, uh...

568
00:21:41,567 --> 00:21:44,268
Oh, sorry, Elston,
good to see you.

569
00:21:44,270 --> 00:21:45,403
Come on
in here, baby.

570
00:21:45,405 --> 00:21:46,404
- You know my wife.
- Of course.

571
00:21:46,406 --> 00:21:47,772
Good to see you.

572
00:21:47,774 --> 00:21:49,607
Listen, um, don't mean
to barge in on you.

573
00:21:49,609 --> 00:21:51,142
We were on
our way to a jazz club

574
00:21:51,144 --> 00:21:54,278
and there's a big accident
on the Kennedy Expressway

575
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:57,114
so decided
to take your exit.

576
00:21:57,116 --> 00:21:59,417
- Got a bottle of
the bubbly.
- Okay.

577
00:21:59,419 --> 00:22:02,286
Thought I'd share
it with you.

578
00:22:02,288 --> 00:22:03,654
We're so sorry
to intrude.

579
00:22:03,656 --> 00:22:06,023
- This was not my idea.
- That's nonsense.

580
00:22:06,025 --> 00:22:07,291
You guys are welcome.

581
00:22:07,293 --> 00:22:10,294
Make yourself
at home.

582
00:22:10,296 --> 00:22:12,296
And who is this
lovely young lady?

583
00:22:12,298 --> 00:22:13,731
This is my
sister Yvette.

584
00:22:13,733 --> 00:22:15,499
You met her last year
at the Christmas party.

585
00:22:15,501 --> 00:22:16,867
Yes, I remember.

586
00:22:16,869 --> 00:22:18,302
You still
look smashing.

587
00:22:18,304 --> 00:22:20,738
Well, thank you.

588
00:22:20,740 --> 00:22:22,440
Yes, you're
very cute.

589
00:22:22,442 --> 00:22:24,175
Thank you.

590
00:22:24,177 --> 00:22:26,944
Oh, my...

591
00:22:26,946 --> 00:22:28,179
What's wrong?

592
00:22:28,181 --> 00:22:31,248
I was just caught off guard
by the size of your feet.

593
00:22:31,250 --> 00:22:32,683
Damn.

594
00:22:32,685 --> 00:22:35,119
Please,
don't take offense.

595
00:22:35,121 --> 00:22:38,255
I-- It just
startled me.

596
00:22:38,257 --> 00:22:40,257
Me a little bit too.

597
00:22:40,259 --> 00:22:43,461
Um, we better pop the cork
on that bottle.

598
00:22:43,463 --> 00:22:45,363
I'll do the honors.

599
00:22:45,365 --> 00:22:47,565
Oh, look, allow me,
I got it.

600
00:22:47,567 --> 00:22:49,900
Ah, Elston.

601
00:22:49,902 --> 00:22:50,768
Bathroom?

602
00:22:50,770 --> 00:22:52,136
( cell phone ringing )

603
00:22:52,138 --> 00:22:54,171
You know, this thing got
a mind of its own.

604
00:22:54,173 --> 00:22:55,606
Hello, yes.

605
00:22:55,608 --> 00:22:56,907
Excuse me.

606
00:22:56,909 --> 00:22:58,509
Yes, I can follow
the team to Dallas.

607
00:22:58,511 --> 00:23:00,378
Yes, yes...

608
00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:04,415
Young man, would you mind
helping a damsel in distress?

609
00:23:04,417 --> 00:23:06,817
No problem.

610
00:23:06,819 --> 00:23:09,487
Thank you.

611
00:23:09,489 --> 00:23:11,689
So, you know,

612
00:23:11,691 --> 00:23:14,492
some things require a strong
young man's touch.

613
00:23:14,494 --> 00:23:16,093
( popping )

614
00:23:16,095 --> 00:23:18,763
Whoo, ah-ha-ha.

615
00:23:18,765 --> 00:23:20,531
I'm getting a raise.

616
00:23:20,533 --> 00:23:21,866
What are you
doing here, Sheila?

617
00:23:21,868 --> 00:23:23,033
Hello-ho-ho.

618
00:23:23,035 --> 00:23:24,869
The question is,
what are you doing here?

619
00:23:24,871 --> 00:23:26,771
I was just helping
her, okay, relax.

620
00:23:26,773 --> 00:23:29,673
Yeah, look like you
was helping yourself.

621
00:23:29,675 --> 00:23:31,242
Bag, please.

622
00:23:31,244 --> 00:23:33,611
Mr. Randall asked me come by
and drop off these files

623
00:23:33,613 --> 00:23:35,579
after I came back
home from my card game.

624
00:23:35,581 --> 00:23:38,249
Oh-ho-ho,
I went blind seven.

625
00:23:38,251 --> 00:23:39,417
I'm set, baby.

626
00:23:39,419 --> 00:23:40,518
I won 50 bucks.

627
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:43,254
Amen and amen.

628
00:23:43,256 --> 00:23:45,423
Whoo.

629
00:23:45,425 --> 00:23:47,925
Elston, uh...

630
00:23:47,927 --> 00:23:50,327
I hope I didn't tear it
up too badly, man.

631
00:23:50,329 --> 00:23:51,896
Baby...

632
00:23:51,898 --> 00:23:55,533
I cannot eat any more of those
burritos from that cantina.

633
00:23:55,535 --> 00:23:57,768
It just tore
my stomach apart.

634
00:23:57,770 --> 00:24:00,070
Yeah, maybe we should
get a move on it.

635
00:24:00,072 --> 00:24:02,206
Looks to me like somebody
else has got a move on

636
00:24:02,208 --> 00:24:03,641
while you were gone.

637
00:24:03,643 --> 00:24:05,009
What does
she mean by that?

638
00:24:05,011 --> 00:24:06,811
Oh, no, no, no,
my tongue, it just gets loose,

639
00:24:06,813 --> 00:24:09,413
you know, when I get to sipping
at those card games.

640
00:24:09,415 --> 00:24:10,848
Don't pay me no mind.

641
00:24:10,850 --> 00:24:12,917
You know, my tongue
gets even looser

642
00:24:12,919 --> 00:24:14,418
when my pocketbook
is lighter.

643
00:24:14,420 --> 00:24:15,619
Thank you very much.

644
00:24:15,621 --> 00:24:17,021
Your generosity
is "muchly" appreciated.

645
00:24:17,023 --> 00:24:19,557
It's gonna go to
a good cause.

646
00:24:19,559 --> 00:24:21,425
Here are your files.

647
00:24:21,427 --> 00:24:22,827
Oh, thank you.

648
00:24:24,529 --> 00:24:26,230
I didn't see
nothing.

649
00:24:26,232 --> 00:24:27,998
Goodbye, Sheila.

650
00:24:29,434 --> 00:24:31,669
What's
that all about?

651
00:24:31,671 --> 00:24:34,505
I think... you need
to cut her hours.

652
00:24:34,507 --> 00:24:36,307
She got a couple
screws loose.

653
00:24:36,309 --> 00:24:38,375
Don't we all.

654
00:24:38,377 --> 00:24:40,878
Listen, baby, why don't we
have a little champagne?

655
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:42,179
We just got here.

656
00:24:42,181 --> 00:24:43,180
Sit back and relax.

657
00:24:43,182 --> 00:24:44,648
Yeah, but, you know,
maybe we should go.

658
00:24:44,650 --> 00:24:46,984
I'm feeling a little
flushed.

659
00:24:46,986 --> 00:24:49,553
Just... a
little flushed.

660
00:24:49,555 --> 00:24:50,721
Okay.

661
00:24:50,723 --> 00:24:52,723
Yeah, um...

662
00:24:52,725 --> 00:24:55,125
Maybe you guys should
take a rain check, you know.

663
00:24:55,127 --> 00:24:57,661
You don't want her
feeling weak and then you guys

664
00:24:57,663 --> 00:24:59,363
have an accident
or something.

665
00:24:59,365 --> 00:25:03,601
Yeah, when I feel like this,
I tend to be a little reckless.

666
00:25:03,603 --> 00:25:05,536
Okay, okay, buttercup.

667
00:25:05,538 --> 00:25:07,004
Whatever you want.

668
00:25:07,006 --> 00:25:09,173
We'll get you home
and get you wrapped up, okay?

669
00:25:09,175 --> 00:25:12,476
Thank you.

670
00:25:12,478 --> 00:25:15,479
Can't keep
my hands off of you.

671
00:25:15,481 --> 00:25:17,047
Hey, listen, um...

672
00:25:17,049 --> 00:25:18,749
- ...sorry we're leaving
so soon.
- No problem.

673
00:25:18,751 --> 00:25:21,285
But I left the bottle
of champagne for you.

674
00:25:21,287 --> 00:25:23,621
And I'll see you in the office
tomorrow, son.

675
00:25:23,623 --> 00:25:25,222
See you tomorrow, sir.

676
00:25:25,224 --> 00:25:26,590
- Let's go, baby.
- Okay.

678
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:32,730

♪

680
00:26:03,161 --> 00:26:05,529
According to this report,
this should be a no-brainer.

681
00:26:05,531 --> 00:26:07,131
The trucker's blood
alcohol level

682
00:26:07,133 --> 00:26:09,066
was well above the
legal limit when he hit her.

683
00:26:09,068 --> 00:26:12,403
I don't know, man,
what kind of monetary value

684
00:26:12,405 --> 00:26:14,805
can you put on a pinkie toe?

685
00:26:14,807 --> 00:26:16,407
Same as any toe.

686
00:26:16,409 --> 00:26:17,775
No, no, not necessarily.

687
00:26:17,777 --> 00:26:19,476
I mean, I don't know if the
jury's gonna see it like that.

688
00:26:19,478 --> 00:26:21,679
You see, now, a pinkie toe
probably should cost

689
00:26:21,681 --> 00:26:23,280
a little
considerably less.

690
00:26:23,282 --> 00:26:27,318
I mean, no, a big toe, yeah, big
toe-- bucks, I understand that.

691

00:26:28,187 --> 00:26:30,187
Let bygones
be bygones.

693
00:26:30,189 --> 00:26:31,922
What kind of
open-toe shoes

694
00:26:31,924 --> 00:26:33,691
a 70-year-old woman
gonna wear anyway?

695
00:26:33,693 --> 00:26:35,025
That pinkie toe
is long gone.

696
00:26:35,027 --> 00:26:37,127
It's dead,
forget about it.

697
00:26:37,129 --> 00:26:40,731
Sometimes I wonder what goes on
in that head of yours.

698
00:26:40,733 --> 00:26:44,902
Look, I just say the things
that people are scared to say.

699
00:26:44,904 --> 00:26:47,871
You say the things
that scare me for you

700
00:26:47,873 --> 00:26:50,841
as well as future
generations.

701
00:26:50,843 --> 00:26:53,010
I... I guess
I'm just tripping, man.

702
00:26:53,012 --> 00:26:54,812
I've been going through some
stuff lately, dude.

703
00:26:54,814 --> 00:26:57,214
This woman's
crazy, dude, I--

704
00:26:57,216 --> 00:26:58,649
She's putting stuff
on the stove,

705
00:26:58,651 --> 00:26:59,984
heating it up
and everything.

706
00:26:59,986 --> 00:27:01,986
She's on some
medieval stuff right now.

707
00:27:01,988 --> 00:27:05,322
I can't handle it, man, I don't
know what's going on.

708
00:27:05,324 --> 00:27:06,690
Yeah, she got issues.

709
00:27:06,692 --> 00:27:09,493
Yeah, she got issues, but
what does it say about me?

710
00:27:09,495 --> 00:27:10,995
I'm still with her.

711
00:27:10,997 --> 00:27:12,997
Why don't you stand up
for yourself, man?

712
00:27:12,999 --> 00:27:14,965
You weren't like
that in college.

713
00:27:14,967 --> 00:27:16,100
Yeah, I know.

714
00:27:16,102 --> 00:27:18,235
I know, I know,
I guess I...

715
00:27:18,237 --> 00:27:20,004
Guess I lost my mojo a
little bit, man.

716
00:27:20,006 --> 00:27:21,005
Yeah, it's like you
lost your confidence

717
00:27:21,007 --> 00:27:22,239
after you didn't
get drafted.

718
00:27:22,241 --> 00:27:23,807
You remember
what happened, dude?

719
00:27:23,809 --> 00:27:25,442
I'm sitting there
waiting to get drafted.

720
00:27:25,444 --> 00:27:27,077
The agent snatches the chicken
wing right out of my mouth.

721
00:27:27,079 --> 00:27:28,445
Just like that, you know?

722
00:27:28,447 --> 00:27:30,247
In front of my friends,
my family members.

723
00:27:30,249 --> 00:27:32,883
I had the whole party set
up, it was embarrassing, dude.

724
00:27:32,885 --> 00:27:34,952
I remember, I had
to pay half the bill.

725
00:27:34,954 --> 00:27:38,455
That was the most humiliating
day of my life.

726
00:27:38,457 --> 00:27:40,491
Hands down.

727
00:27:42,994 --> 00:27:45,829
It was just...
humiliating.

728
00:27:45,831 --> 00:27:46,997
You was a loser, too.

729
00:27:46,999 --> 00:27:48,532
Yes, you know what?

730
00:27:48,534 --> 00:27:51,468
My grandmother even
called me a loser.

731
00:27:51,470 --> 00:27:52,903
You're not a loser, man.

732
00:27:52,905 --> 00:27:56,240
Look, you're-- you're--
look, you're a junior lawyer.

733
00:27:56,242 --> 00:27:58,442
Come on.

734
00:27:58,444 --> 00:28:00,744
I'm a junior lawyer.

735
00:28:00,746 --> 00:28:04,515
Yes, and now you
probably should leave.

736
00:28:04,517 --> 00:28:06,016
You know what?

737
00:28:06,018 --> 00:28:08,018
On that note, I'm just gonna
get out of here, man.

738
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:10,921
- I got some things to
take care of.
- All right.

739
00:28:10,923 --> 00:28:16,393
- You can finish
up yourself.
- Shake it off, buddy.

740
00:28:16,395 --> 00:28:18,228
Junior lawyer.

741
00:28:23,535 --> 00:28:24,802
♪

742
00:28:24,804 --> 00:28:27,871
( sighing )
( knocking )

743
00:28:31,476 --> 00:28:33,377
Uh...

744
00:28:33,379 --> 00:28:35,479
- ... what are you
doing here?
- Shh!

745
00:28:35,481 --> 00:28:37,081
Look...

746
00:28:37,083 --> 00:28:38,816
No, listen, about
last night, uh--

747
00:28:38,818 --> 00:28:39,950
Shh.

748
00:28:39,952 --> 00:28:41,118
I was totally in
the wrong.

749
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:44,588
Don't say
not another word.

750
00:28:44,590 --> 00:28:45,889
It was my fault.

751
00:28:45,891 --> 00:28:49,193
Sometimes I just--
I just don't think straight.

752
00:28:49,195 --> 00:28:50,794
No, it's okay,
I know what you mean.

753
00:28:50,796 --> 00:28:53,097
Listen, let's just promise
each other that

754
00:28:53,099 --> 00:28:54,832
it won't happen again.

755
00:28:54,834 --> 00:28:57,034
No harm, no foul,
right?

756
00:28:57,036 --> 00:28:58,535
- Agreed.
- Agreed.

757
00:28:58,537 --> 00:29:00,204
Now I think it would be
in your best interest

758
00:29:00,206 --> 00:29:02,372
to clear the premises
'cause you do not want to let

759
00:29:02,374 --> 00:29:03,373
Sheila catch you here.

760
00:29:03,375 --> 00:29:04,374
You know how she is.

761
00:29:04,376 --> 00:29:06,243
I slipped her a 20
on the way in.

762
00:29:06,245 --> 00:29:07,845
She's looking out for me.

763
00:29:07,847 --> 00:29:10,581
Ah, the power of money,
I love it.

764
00:29:10,583 --> 00:29:13,984
See, that's just
it, Elston.

765
00:29:13,986 --> 00:29:16,754
I thought that money
would make me happy.

766
00:29:16,756 --> 00:29:20,324
I thought that it would make me
love him more but it didn't.

767
00:29:20,326 --> 00:29:22,159
I ended up marrying for
all the wrong reasons

768
00:29:22,161 --> 00:29:23,927
and when I look at you,

769
00:29:23,929 --> 00:29:27,564
it just reminds me
that, um...

770
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,667
Yeah, listen, um...

771
00:29:30,669 --> 00:29:33,904
I'm not sure I wanna have
this conversation now.

772
00:29:33,906 --> 00:29:36,907
He's my boss and he's
been really good to me.

773
00:29:36,909 --> 00:29:38,342
All right?

774
00:29:38,344 --> 00:29:39,676
You think
you know that man?

775
00:29:39,678 --> 00:29:41,044
You don't.

776
00:29:41,046 --> 00:29:43,147
That man, he is greedy
and he is low-down.

777
00:29:43,149 --> 00:29:45,682
- Okay--
- He built this firm
on the backs

778
00:29:45,684 --> 00:29:49,019
of loyal, hard-working,
dedicated people like you.

779
00:29:49,021 --> 00:29:50,821
He's just like his father
and his grandfather.

780
00:29:50,823 --> 00:29:52,656
Okay, listen.

781
00:29:52,658 --> 00:29:55,092
He's your husband,
all right.

782
00:29:55,094 --> 00:30:00,898
Yes, and that's why I have
the right to tell the truth.

783
00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:06,036
Okay, I'd really rather not have
this conversation, all right?

784
00:30:06,038 --> 00:30:08,005
All right,
maybe you're right.

785
00:30:08,007 --> 00:30:09,373
I'm sorry to bother you.

786
00:30:09,375 --> 00:30:14,211
It's no problem.

787
00:30:14,213 --> 00:30:15,979
He's coming
down the hall.

788
00:30:15,981 --> 00:30:17,047
If you want me to
fake a seizure,

789
00:30:17,049 --> 00:30:18,215
it'll be an
extra 40 bucks.

790
00:30:18,217 --> 00:30:20,284
- It's not necessary.
- You sure?

791
00:30:20,286 --> 00:30:22,085
I talked myself out of
two speeding tickets that way.

792
00:30:22,087 --> 00:30:24,054
Works like a charm.

793
00:30:24,056 --> 00:30:25,656
Come on, girl, now you--

794
00:30:25,658 --> 00:30:28,192
No, no, no, you are not about to
pay my bills if I lose this job.

795
00:30:28,194 --> 00:30:29,960
Now come on, get your stuff,
get your bags together.

796
00:30:29,962 --> 00:30:31,762
Come on, get out of here,
get out!

797
00:30:31,764 --> 00:30:34,398
Look...

798
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:35,732
everything's gonna
come to the light.

799
00:30:35,734 --> 00:30:40,470
You're gonna
see the truth.

800
00:30:40,472 --> 00:30:41,471
( door closing )

801
00:30:41,473 --> 00:30:43,173
Yeah, baby,
yeah, I know.

802
00:30:43,175 --> 00:30:44,808
Yeah, yeah,
I just went to the bathroom.

803
00:30:44,810 --> 00:30:46,410
That's all I did.

804
00:30:46,412 --> 00:30:48,378
I know, I should have called you
on my cell phone, but, yeah,

805
00:30:48,380 --> 00:30:50,948
it takes a little longer 'cause
they didn't have paper towels.

806
00:30:50,950 --> 00:30:52,449
And you know I don't
like to air dry.

807
00:30:52,451 --> 00:30:54,117
I can't go
back to my desk soggy.

808
00:30:54,119 --> 00:30:56,220
Sweet-- No, no, I didn't.

809
00:30:56,222 --> 00:30:57,721
Okay, number two.

810
00:30:57,723 --> 00:30:59,156
Are you happy?

811
00:30:59,158 --> 00:31:00,791
No, I didn't go talk to
the Human Resources lady.

812
00:31:00,793 --> 00:31:03,160
No, you messed that up
for me, yeah, you did.

813
00:31:03,162 --> 00:31:05,429
Yeah, you remember, you called
in a bomb threat.

814
00:31:05,431 --> 00:31:06,496
Yeah, now she's
scared to death.

815
00:31:06,498 --> 00:31:08,031
Yeah, every time she
see me,

816
00:31:08,033 --> 00:31:09,366
yeah, she runs
in the opposite direction.

817
00:31:09,368 --> 00:31:11,802
Imagine Flo Jo on the 47th floor
in kitten heels,

818
00:31:11,804 --> 00:31:12,836
just going that way.

819
00:31:12,838 --> 00:31:13,971
That's what happens.

820
00:31:13,973 --> 00:31:17,774
Yeah, un-huh.
( crying )

821
00:31:17,776 --> 00:31:20,978
Yeah, okay, look, baby,
I'm gonna call you back, okay?

822
00:31:20,980 --> 00:31:22,846
Yeah, in 10.4 minutes.

823
00:31:22,848 --> 00:31:24,648
Yeah, I'll call
you back, I promise.

824
00:31:24,650 --> 00:31:25,849
I know you're counting.

825
00:31:25,851 --> 00:31:27,851
Okay, love you.

826
00:31:27,853 --> 00:31:29,753
He dumped me!

827
00:31:29,755 --> 00:31:31,188
Who-- who, Charles?

828
00:31:31,190 --> 00:31:32,756
The married guy.

829
00:31:32,758 --> 00:31:33,891
Yeah, he said
I should've known

830
00:31:33,893 --> 00:31:36,159
that what we had
was just temporary.

831
00:31:36,161 --> 00:31:37,861
Just for fun.

832
00:31:37,863 --> 00:31:38,896
Ohh...

833
00:31:38,898 --> 00:31:40,530
I feel so used.

834
00:31:40,532 --> 00:31:42,032
Oh, ooh, oh.

835
00:31:42,034 --> 00:31:43,667
I mean, ooh,
don't cry.

836
00:31:43,669 --> 00:31:46,136
Oh, oh, the pain, I can
feel the pain from--

837
00:31:46,138 --> 00:31:47,237
Don't cry.

838
00:31:47,239 --> 00:31:48,505
Come on, ooh,
come on, just...

839
00:31:48,507 --> 00:31:51,642
I know, even trampolines
need love too.

840
00:31:51,644 --> 00:31:53,410
I hate to say
I told you so, Sheila.

841
00:31:53,412 --> 00:31:55,612
- But I told you so.
- Gee, thanks.

842
00:31:55,614 --> 00:31:56,647
Well, what...

843
00:31:56,649 --> 00:31:58,081
Well, what do you
want me to say?

844
00:31:58,083 --> 00:31:59,416
What do you
expect for me to say?

845
00:31:59,418 --> 00:32:00,918
When you're wrong, you're
wrong, Sheila.

846
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:03,020
You can't be going
around wrecking people's homes,

847
00:32:03,022 --> 00:32:04,321
wrecking this,
wrecking that.

848
00:32:04,323 --> 00:32:06,323
In the words
of the immortal Ice Cube:

849
00:32:06,325 --> 00:32:07,524
♪ You better check yourself

850
00:32:07,526 --> 00:32:09,092
♪ Before you
wreck yourself ♪

851
00:32:09,094 --> 00:32:10,694
♪ You better check
yourself... ♪

852
00:32:10,696 --> 00:32:13,397
You can't even understand.

853
00:32:13,399 --> 00:32:14,898
You can't.

854
00:32:14,900 --> 00:32:16,233
No.

855
00:32:16,235 --> 00:32:19,369
I never had no one
to love me, okay?

856
00:32:19,371 --> 00:32:22,739
My father left me and my mother
when I was eight years old.

857
00:32:22,741 --> 00:32:25,175
Do you know what it's like to
cry yourself to sleep at night

858
00:32:25,177 --> 00:32:27,511
because you miss
somebody so much?

859
00:32:27,513 --> 00:32:28,612
Do you wonder?

860
00:32:28,614 --> 00:32:31,214
You ever wonder why somebody
doesn't love you?

861
00:32:31,216 --> 00:32:33,016
No, no, you don't.

862
00:32:33,018 --> 00:32:36,219
So you just need
to shut your mouth!

863
00:32:36,221 --> 00:32:38,055
That's enough now.

864
00:32:38,057 --> 00:32:39,623
I know what it
feels like to hurt.

865
00:32:39,625 --> 00:32:42,092
I know what it feels like
to have a spicy chicken wing

866
00:32:42,094 --> 00:32:44,728
ripped out of your mouth
when you don't make the draft.

867
00:32:44,730 --> 00:32:45,829
And you know what?

868
00:32:45,831 --> 00:32:47,164
I know what it's like
to pay the bill

869
00:32:47,166 --> 00:32:48,432
at that dinner
at that draft.

870
00:32:48,434 --> 00:32:49,900
You know how embarrassing
that is?

871
00:32:49,902 --> 00:32:51,468
You know how hard it is
to go back to the block

872
00:32:51,470 --> 00:32:52,736
where you ain't
got drafted?

873
00:32:52,738 --> 00:32:54,905
Now I'm here dealing
with you and everything.

874
00:32:54,907 --> 00:32:55,973
I know about that pain.

875
00:32:55,975 --> 00:32:57,574
I deal with that
pain every day.

876
00:32:57,576 --> 00:33:00,143
But you know what,
I know God's got my back.

877
00:33:00,145 --> 00:33:01,845
God don't like ugly.

878
00:33:01,847 --> 00:33:03,480
So of course you're gonna have
a little harder time than most.

879
00:33:03,482 --> 00:33:04,881
You are, I'm just saying.

880
00:33:04,883 --> 00:33:06,883
But still, you gotta
get down on your knees.

881
00:33:06,885 --> 00:33:09,019
You gotta get down on
your knees and pray.

882
00:33:09,021 --> 00:33:10,754
Hallelujah,
Honda Civic, Osama Bama.

883
00:33:10,756 --> 00:33:12,756
Yes, you gotta get down
on your knees

884
00:33:12,758 --> 00:33:14,925
and you got to
pray, all right?

885
00:33:14,927 --> 00:33:16,393
You know, I just...

886
00:33:16,395 --> 00:33:18,362
You know what, I'm gonna
get back to work

887
00:33:18,364 --> 00:33:19,730
because if I get to
preaching around here,

888
00:33:19,732 --> 00:33:21,331
I'm gonna get
the Holy Ghost.

889
00:33:21,333 --> 00:33:22,799
Y'all ain't gonna hear me
up in this piece.

890
00:33:22,801 --> 00:33:24,101
You know, I'm gonna go off.

891
00:33:24,103 --> 00:33:28,105

893
00:33:29,475 --> 00:33:32,009
Can you hold
all my calls please?

894
00:33:32,011 --> 00:33:34,378
Uh, Yeah, Mr. Rand--
hey, how you doing?

895
00:33:34,380 --> 00:33:37,280
You need some coffee, take
your coat, anything?

896
00:33:37,282 --> 00:33:39,716
Yeah, I need a coffee
with three Splendas.

897
00:33:39,718 --> 00:33:41,718
Okay, three Splendas,
all right, and so, uh...

898
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:44,654
three Splendas, so Jarvis
Brown getting your coffee.

899
00:33:44,656 --> 00:33:47,124
Remember Jarvis Brown,
'cause I get the coffee.

900
00:33:47,126 --> 00:33:50,394
Go this way, all right now...

901
00:33:50,396 --> 00:33:52,629
Can you have Elston
meet me in my office?

902
00:33:52,631 --> 00:33:55,699
I need to have a very personal
conversation with him.

903
00:33:55,701 --> 00:33:58,168
Oh, yes, sir.

904
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:05,609
Remember, Jarvis Brown,
coffee, anytime.

905
00:34:05,611 --> 00:34:09,980
Got ya,
I'll be right back.

907
00:34:13,619 --> 00:34:14,451
Oh, he knows.

908
00:34:14,453 --> 00:34:16,386
He knows,
he knows everything.

909
00:34:16,388 --> 00:34:18,121
- Did you open your big mouth?
- I can't believe it,
I can't believe it.

910
00:34:18,123 --> 00:34:19,990
- My money supply's
gonna dry!
- I didn't do anything.

911
00:34:19,992 --> 00:34:21,591
- What if I die,
what if I die?
- I didn't do anything.

912
00:34:21,593 --> 00:34:22,993
Take it to
the grave, man.

913
00:34:22,995 --> 00:34:24,461
Take it to the grave, that's
that I always say, man.

914
00:34:24,463 --> 00:34:26,296
That's it, I'm
telling you right now--

915
00:34:26,298 --> 00:34:27,431
You've been so
good to me.

916
00:34:27,433 --> 00:34:28,665
I can't believe
he's gonna kill you.

917
00:34:28,667 --> 00:34:30,233
First you're gonna
get fired.

918
00:34:30,235 --> 00:34:31,768
Oh, no, I'm gonna miss you
so much, Elston.

919
00:34:31,770 --> 00:34:33,103
Where's he at?

920
00:34:33,105 --> 00:34:34,404
He said for you to meet him
in the conference room.

921
00:34:34,406 --> 00:34:35,672
All right, conference
room it is.

922
00:34:35,674 --> 00:34:37,607
Oh, Elston...
after you get killed,

923
00:34:37,609 --> 00:34:39,176
since I know the combination
to your safe

924
00:34:39,178 --> 00:34:41,311
can I have
that $1,500-- please?

925

a beauty procedure.

stressed out right now.

Everybody here is crazy.

00:34:51,890 --> 00:34:54,458
Yeah, okay, just
sing it like you used to.

931
00:34:54,460 --> 00:34:55,792
I'll sing with you.

I just punched him
in the face.

You know, that's what we

I'll tell you later.

I ain't seen
your face long like that

943
00:35:19,885 --> 00:35:22,219
since you punched a cheerleader
for stealing your dance moves.

944
00:35:22,221 --> 00:35:23,487
That was you, not me.

971
00:36:27,619 --> 00:36:30,954
This firm has been the
cornerstone of this community

for over a decade.

973
00:36:33,058 --> 00:36:34,858
And I'm very proud
of that.

you're not gonna get the job.

we may go

little bit more qualified.

985
00:37:09,061 --> 00:37:12,028
More qualified?

986
00:37:12,030 --> 00:37:14,864

987
00:37:14,866 --> 00:37:15,765

no vacations.

989
00:37:19,304 --> 00:37:21,404
How can you tell me
"more qualified"?!

990
00:37:24,108 --> 00:37:25,742
That's my position.

991
00:37:25,744 --> 00:37:28,411
Son, I've been
watching you

992
00:37:28,413 --> 00:37:31,348
and you've been walking
around here with your--

993
00:37:31,350 --> 00:37:33,883
your chest poked out,

994
00:37:33,885 --> 00:37:36,019
like you're the big gun,
like you're the top gun,

995
00:37:36,021 --> 00:37:39,623
like you're
running things around here.

996
00:37:39,625 --> 00:37:42,325
Like I owe you something.

997
00:37:42,327 --> 00:37:45,228
Can I ask you
a question?

998
00:37:45,230 --> 00:37:48,565

you something?

1001
00:37:53,805 --> 00:37:55,772
Maybe you'll be ready
in a few years.

1002
00:37:55,774 --> 00:37:58,041
But you're
not ready now.

1003
00:37:58,043 --> 00:38:00,577
So I'll have my decision
in a few weeks.

1004
00:38:00,579 --> 00:38:03,680
I don't have
any words right now.

1005
00:38:03,682 --> 00:38:06,516
Sometimes no words
is the best answer.

1006
00:38:09,654 --> 00:38:12,555
Can I go?
I have some work to do.

1007
00:38:12,557 --> 00:38:15,592
You know, I have to go
pick up that Simmons check.

1008
00:38:15,594 --> 00:38:17,460
You know, she's getting
a half a million dollars

1009
00:38:17,462 --> 00:38:20,196
for a pinkie toe?

1010
00:38:20,198 --> 00:38:23,166
Do you know how much
she could've got for a big toe?

1011
00:38:23,168 --> 00:38:24,567

1012
00:38:24,569 --> 00:38:25,935
You know what?

1013
00:38:25,937 --> 00:38:27,537
If you threw in a hand
and a foot...

1014
00:38:27,539 --> 00:38:29,205
( laughing )

1015
00:38:29,207 --> 00:38:31,441
... she could clean up.

1016
00:38:31,443 --> 00:38:32,942
( laughing )

1017
00:38:32,944 --> 00:38:35,011
Listen...

1018
00:38:35,013 --> 00:38:37,947
it's gonna be fine.

stop sending me

1022
00:38:56,001 --> 00:39:01,037
directly to your
voice-mail and call me back?

00:39:14,785 --> 00:39:17,420
What are you
doing here?

1025
00:39:17,422 --> 00:39:18,755
He just walked out.

1026
00:39:18,757 --> 00:39:19,856
I was listening
at the door.

1027
00:39:19,858 --> 00:39:22,592
I guess you were
right, I...

1028
00:39:22,594 --> 00:39:25,362
I tried to warn you.

1029
00:39:25,364 --> 00:39:27,831
I have to admit it,
I...

1030
00:39:27,833 --> 00:39:29,632
I just don't
think you understand

1031
00:39:29,634 --> 00:39:31,835
what I did for
that man.

1034
00:39:40,011 --> 00:39:43,413
I haven't had a vacation
in five years.

1035
00:39:43,415 --> 00:39:47,851
Three days after my mother
passed I was back at work.

1036
00:39:47,853 --> 00:39:50,153

my relationship with God.

1129
00:43:51,363 --> 00:43:52,762

I mean, with her...

1131
00:43:54,132 --> 00:43:55,965
she doesn't see
eye-to-eye about that.

1132
00:43:55,967 --> 00:43:58,835
I mean, she hates
organized religion.

1133
00:43:58,837 --> 00:44:00,403
Well, pray for her

1134
00:44:00,405 --> 00:44:03,373
and let the Holy Spirit
deal with that.

1135
00:44:03,375 --> 00:44:05,041
I mean, look...

1136
00:44:05,043 --> 00:44:08,711
you-- you should just
love her

1137
00:44:08,713 --> 00:44:11,481
and lead by example.

1138
00:44:11,483 --> 00:44:16,119
You should let her see
what He has done in your life.

1139
00:44:16,121 --> 00:44:17,553
Wow.

1140
00:44:17,555 --> 00:44:19,022

1141
00:44:19,024 --> 00:44:20,790

1142
00:44:20,792 --> 00:44:22,225

- No, I do.

1143
00:44:22,227 --> 00:44:24,127

I'll be asleep...

1144
00:44:24,129 --> 00:44:25,628
- Dream about you.
- Stop it.

1145
00:44:25,630 --> 00:44:27,864

have the right answers.

Uh, behave yourself.

1161
00:44:57,529 --> 00:45:00,563

Oh, don't be silly.

1185

I'm here for
my check.

1186
00:46:07,832 --> 00:46:09,398
God done took
that toe back, child.

1187
00:46:09,400 --> 00:46:11,033
Ain't nothing I can
do about that.

1188
00:46:11,035 --> 00:46:12,802
Well, Mr. Randall,
he went to pick it up.

1189
00:46:12,804 --> 00:46:16,405
He insisted that he do it in
person and deliver it to you.

1190
00:46:16,407 --> 00:46:18,374
See, that's why I called
this firm right away

1191
00:46:18,376 --> 00:46:20,743
as soon as I had
that accident.

1192
00:46:20,745 --> 00:46:22,845
The personal service.

1193
00:46:22,847 --> 00:46:25,014
His grandfather
was like that too, you know.

1194
00:46:25,016 --> 00:46:28,017
Well, it's the least we can
do, considering...

1195
00:46:28,019 --> 00:46:29,685
Honey, don't feel
sorry for me.

1196
00:46:29,687 --> 00:46:30,887
Feel sorry for yourself

1197
00:46:30,889 --> 00:46:32,388
but that man better
hurry up and come on

1198
00:46:32,390 --> 00:46:34,090
because I'm late for
my tango class.

1199
00:46:34,092 --> 00:46:35,958
- Shoot.
- Tango?

1200
00:46:35,960 --> 00:46:37,727
What part of "tango"
don't you understand?

1201
00:46:37,729 --> 00:46:39,529
The "tan" or
the "go"?

1202
00:46:39,531 --> 00:46:41,697
See, that's what's wrong
with you young people.

1203
00:46:41,699 --> 00:46:43,032
You're running
around here upset

1204
00:46:43,034 --> 00:46:44,700
because your life
ain't going the way you want.

1205
00:46:44,702 --> 00:46:47,670
That's because you're not
grounded in the word.

1206
00:46:47,672 --> 00:46:49,338
You don't know
how God operates.

1207
00:46:49,340 --> 00:46:52,041
Honey, life is like
a parade.

1208
00:46:52,043 --> 00:46:53,442
You standing
on the street watching

1209
00:46:53,444 --> 00:46:57,079
but God is way up top
looking down.

1210
00:46:57,081 --> 00:46:59,081
He's can see
the beginning of the parade

1211
00:46:59,083 --> 00:47:01,951
and the end of
the parade.

1212
00:47:01,953 --> 00:47:03,853
But you can't.

1213
00:47:03,855 --> 00:47:06,689
That's why we have to
have faith, sister.

1214
00:47:06,691 --> 00:47:08,424
Well, is that--

1215
00:47:08,426 --> 00:47:10,893
Is that why
He makes us feel pain?

1216
00:47:10,895 --> 00:47:12,261
The Bible says:

1217
00:47:12,263 --> 00:47:14,430
"Weeping endures
for a night

1218
00:47:14,432 --> 00:47:15,898
"but joy...

1219
00:47:15,900 --> 00:47:17,333
joy cometh
in the morning"

1221

Try Him.

1222
00:47:19,737 --> 00:47:20,903
Ask Him.

1223
00:47:20,905 --> 00:47:22,772
Ask Him to reveal
Himself to you.

1224
00:47:22,774 --> 00:47:24,440
♪

1225
00:47:24,442 --> 00:47:28,978
Ask Him to give you the strength
so that you can endure.

1226
00:47:28,980 --> 00:47:31,747
And you'll see.

1227
00:47:31,749 --> 00:47:34,350
All things come
together for good

1228
00:47:34,352 --> 00:47:36,219
for those who love
the Lord.

1229
00:47:36,221 --> 00:47:37,954
That's why God
let me lose this toe

1230
00:47:37,956 --> 00:47:40,890
so I could be a blessing
to somebody.

1231
00:47:40,892 --> 00:47:42,191
See, I'm leaving
most of this money

1232
00:47:42,193 --> 00:47:44,026
for some college
scholarships.

1233
00:47:44,028 --> 00:47:45,094
Oh.

1234
00:47:45,096 --> 00:47:46,495
Oh, yes, God
had a plan, honey.

1235
00:47:46,497 --> 00:47:48,698
Whoa, that is so
generous of you.

1236
00:47:48,700 --> 00:47:50,833
Oh, that ain't nothing,
I didn't do nothing.

1237
00:47:50,835 --> 00:47:52,134
God did it all.

1238
00:47:52,136 --> 00:47:53,803
And this ain't nothing.

1239
00:47:53,805 --> 00:47:55,705
My parents
were junkies.

1240

Left me on a housekeeper's
doorstep when I was ten.

1241

Hurt like hell.

1242
00:48:01,246 --> 00:48:03,379
But then one day
I picked up that Bible

1243
00:48:03,381 --> 00:48:06,082
and I learned that I could
not dwell in the past.

1244
00:48:06,084 --> 00:48:08,117
My future was up to me.

1245
00:48:08,119 --> 00:48:12,121
I couldn't let somebody
else's stupid decisions

1246
00:48:12,123 --> 00:48:15,625
impact my thoughts.

1247
00:48:15,627 --> 00:48:18,561

anger and hurt

I was somebody.

- Why?

'Cause my Heavenly Father
said so.

myself the way God sees me

enough to give His life for.

00:53:57,568 --> 00:54:01,737
I can't--
I can't go on like this.

1380
00:54:01,739 --> 00:54:06,742
- I'm sorry--
- No, you're
not sorry.

1381
00:54:06,744 --> 00:54:10,613
Because I know where
that light went.

1382
00:54:10,615 --> 00:54:13,716
I saw it when
you looked at her.

1383
00:54:19,189 --> 00:54:20,990
Do you even
love me anymore?

1384
00:54:20,992 --> 00:54:21,991
Come on with this--

1385
00:54:21,993 --> 00:54:23,192
Do you even love me?

1386
00:54:23,194 --> 00:54:25,027
What kind of question--
what kind of question...

1387
00:54:25,029 --> 00:54:30,432
- Just answer
the question, Jarvis.
- I...

1388
00:54:30,434 --> 00:54:33,502
- I--
- Don't.

1389
00:54:33,504 --> 00:54:36,939
Just...
just don't.

1390
00:54:38,842 --> 00:54:41,043
I'll have my sister
pack my things.

1391
00:54:41,045 --> 00:54:42,978
- It doesn't have to
end like this.
- Don't!

1392
00:54:42,980 --> 00:54:46,715
Don't.

1393
00:54:46,717 --> 00:54:51,320

Well, we'll have plenty
of time to talk about it

- Yes, we will.

in his right mind

- I love you, too.
- Okay.

would be okay

- Okay.
- Yes.

the Super Bowl.
- Yes.

Yeah, I saw Sheila
at the office.

1446

She said you'd be here.

1447
00:57:18,469 --> 00:57:20,135
Amazingly, she didn't
charge me this time

1448
00:57:20,137 --> 00:57:23,472
because she said something
about a building and a parade

1449
00:57:23,474 --> 00:57:26,642
and God was on top of
the building and...

1450
00:57:26,644 --> 00:57:28,677
Yeah, um...

1451
00:57:28,679 --> 00:57:30,145
You never know
with Sheila.

1452
00:57:30,147 --> 00:57:31,213
Yeah.

1453
00:57:31,215 --> 00:57:34,550
Um... have a seat.

Gladly.

1455
00:57:36,420 --> 00:57:39,288
Can I, um, get you
something to drink?

1456
00:57:39,290 --> 00:57:40,722
No, that's okay.

the bushes and ended up

1459

twisting my ankle
and ruining my shoes.

about yesterday, I...

Look, just hush.

1468
00:58:17,127 --> 00:58:18,994
Don't say a word.

You know me, always
chasing that story.

1552
01:01:42,766 --> 01:01:44,199
Yeah, I'm chasing you and
you chasing your career.

1553
01:01:44,201 --> 01:01:45,834
Yeah.

1554
01:01:45,836 --> 01:01:47,235
Yeah.

1555
01:01:47,237 --> 01:01:50,105
Well, um...

1556
01:01:50,107 --> 01:01:52,641
I guess this
is goodbye then.

1557
01:01:52,643 --> 01:01:53,875
- Yeah.
- Yeah, yeah.

1558
01:01:53,877 --> 01:01:57,212
- It's goodbye.
- It's goodbye again.

1559
01:01:57,214 --> 01:01:58,680
Yeah.

1560
01:01:58,682 --> 01:02:00,382
Well, take care of
yourself.

1561
01:02:00,384 --> 01:02:01,349
Oh, you know me,

1562
01:02:01,351 --> 01:02:03,552
always taking
care of myself.

1563
01:02:03,554 --> 01:02:06,855
Let's...

1564
01:02:14,997 --> 01:02:17,666
I have an extra ticket
to the Dallas game.

1565
01:02:17,668 --> 01:02:19,968
Courtside.

1566
01:02:19,970 --> 01:02:21,036
Courtside?

1567
01:02:21,038 --> 01:02:25,440
Did I stutter?
( laughing )

1568
01:02:25,442 --> 01:02:28,810
Yvette, look.

1569
01:02:28,812 --> 01:02:30,078
Even though I
would love--

1570
01:02:30,080 --> 01:02:32,748
and when I say love
I do mean love--

1571
01:02:32,750 --> 01:02:36,084
the idea of getting rid of
all my worldly possessions

1572
01:02:36,086 --> 01:02:39,688
and following you
to the ends of the earth.

1573
01:02:39,690 --> 01:02:41,256
I just can't right now.

1574
01:02:41,258 --> 01:02:43,859
I mean, God has called me
to a life of integrity

1575
01:02:43,861 --> 01:02:45,093
and that's how I gotta be.

1576
01:02:45,095 --> 01:02:48,764
I mean, I can't honestly
give 100% to this

1577
01:02:48,766 --> 01:02:51,032
until I have
closure with Raven.

1578
01:02:51,034 --> 01:02:53,902
And, I mean, this is
how I am.

1579
01:02:53,904 --> 01:02:55,971
Better yet...

1580
01:02:55,973 --> 01:02:59,574
that's how
God made me.

1581
01:02:59,576 --> 01:03:02,210
I understand.

1582
01:03:02,212 --> 01:03:04,146
That's...

1583
01:03:04,148 --> 01:03:07,482
that's another one of the
qualities that I love about you.

1584
01:03:07,484 --> 01:03:10,819
You serve it straight up.

1585
01:03:10,821 --> 01:03:14,356
It's just a double-edged
sword sometimes.

1586
01:03:14,358 --> 01:03:17,526
Take care.

1587
01:03:29,305 --> 01:03:32,541
Hey, Raven,
yeah, hi, yeah, it's me.

1588
01:03:32,543 --> 01:03:35,410
Okay, all right, look, look,
look, I need to talk--

1589
01:03:35,412 --> 01:03:37,179
I need to talk--
let me, can I speak?

1590
01:03:37,181 --> 01:03:38,980
Can I speak, though?

1591
01:03:38,982 --> 01:03:41,049
I need to talk to you
about something serious.

1592
01:03:41,051 --> 01:03:43,318
Where are we going with
this relationship?

1593
01:03:43,320 --> 01:03:46,688
Like, I am not gonna be
your punching bag forever.

1594
01:03:46,690 --> 01:03:49,090
Yeah, I just don't wanna
play games anymore.

1595
01:03:49,092 --> 01:03:51,693
Are you interested in
trying to make it work?

1596
01:03:51,695 --> 01:03:53,461
So it's over?

1597
01:03:53,463 --> 01:03:55,630
Well, let it be
over then, all right.

1598
01:03:55,632 --> 01:03:58,500
But, look, look, look, I want
my SpongeBob onesie back.

1599
01:03:58,502 --> 01:04:01,336
No, that's mine,
that's non-negotiable.

1600
01:04:01,338 --> 01:04:03,672
Yeah, oh, yeah,
that's mine.

1601
01:04:06,075 --> 01:04:09,177
Jarvis, look...

1602
01:04:09,179 --> 01:04:10,779
I missed you so much

1603
01:04:10,781 --> 01:04:12,681
and I'm not
leaving without you.

1604
01:04:12,683 --> 01:04:14,683
Not this time.

1605
01:04:14,685 --> 01:04:16,618
You don't have to.

1606
01:04:18,588 --> 01:04:19,921
Courtside it is.

1607
01:04:19,923 --> 01:04:22,691
( laughing )

1608
01:04:22,693 --> 01:04:24,392
- Okay, let's go.
- Oh yeah, we're gonna
be late.

1609
01:04:24,394 --> 01:04:25,660
Oh, yeah!

1610
01:04:25,662 --> 01:04:29,364
( horn honking )

1611
01:04:29,366 --> 01:04:32,934
Andrew, you tell
the most fascinating stories.

1612
01:04:32,936 --> 01:04:35,437
I never would've guessed
you were a war hero.

1613
01:04:35,439 --> 01:04:38,039
Well, not exactly, I mean,
I was a military lawyer

1614
01:04:38,041 --> 01:04:40,709
and I served
during wartime but...

1615
01:04:40,711 --> 01:04:42,143
Sounds like
a war hero to me.

1616
01:04:42,145 --> 01:04:43,945
Okay, I'll take that.

1617
01:04:43,947 --> 01:04:45,914
So how was your meeting?

1618
01:04:45,916 --> 01:04:47,282
( sighing )

1619
01:04:47,284 --> 01:04:48,683
You guys drive a hard bargain
around here

1620
01:04:48,685 --> 01:04:51,786
but honestly,
you have made it all worth it.

1621
01:04:51,788 --> 01:04:54,856
Those words just flow out of
your mouth so smoothly.

1622
01:04:54,858 --> 01:04:56,024
Keep talking.

1623
01:04:56,026 --> 01:04:57,292
What time's
your lunch break?

1624
01:04:57,294 --> 01:04:58,126
Now.

1625
01:04:58,128 --> 01:04:59,628
( chuckling )

1626
01:04:59,630 --> 01:05:02,030
Ohh, and, um...

1627
01:05:02,032 --> 01:05:03,565
I know the perfect place.

1628
01:05:03,567 --> 01:05:04,532
It's on me

1629
01:05:04,534 --> 01:05:07,002
since we just
took all of your money.

1630
01:05:07,004 --> 01:05:10,005
- Come on.
- All right.

1631
01:05:10,007 --> 01:05:13,074
- Oh.
- Mm-hmm.

1632
01:05:16,045 --> 01:05:18,546
It's been a while
since I was able

1633
01:05:18,548 --> 01:05:20,482
to spend time with
someone like this, you know?

1634
01:05:20,484 --> 01:05:24,886
Yeah, a man like you, I'm sure
you have plenty of women around.

1635
01:05:24,888 --> 01:05:26,688
You know, actually...

1636
01:05:26,690 --> 01:05:29,557
I'm not really the type
to have a lot of women around.

1637
01:05:29,559 --> 01:05:30,558
I'm more of a...

1638
01:05:30,560 --> 01:05:32,961
one-woman type of guy,
you know?

1639
01:05:32,963 --> 01:05:34,262
Okay.

1640
01:05:34,264 --> 01:05:35,797
See, why didn't
I meet you first?

1641
01:05:35,799 --> 01:05:37,232
This is terrible.

1642
01:05:37,234 --> 01:05:39,200
I would've chose
you any day.

1643
01:05:39,202 --> 01:05:41,670
Uh, that makes
me feel good...

1644
01:05:41,672 --> 01:05:44,506
sort of.

1645
01:05:44,508 --> 01:05:46,141
So it's getting
kind of late.

1646
01:05:46,143 --> 01:05:47,976
I think you better
go back to the office.

1647
01:05:47,978 --> 01:05:50,512
I have to go to the mall before
Randall gets back home.

1648
01:05:50,514 --> 01:05:52,914
When will
I see you again?

1649
01:05:52,916 --> 01:05:54,015
Again.

1650
01:05:54,017 --> 01:05:56,251
You'll see me soon.

1651
01:05:56,253 --> 01:05:58,353
Well, I hope so.

1652
01:05:58,355 --> 01:05:59,888
Oh, speaking of soon,

1653
01:05:59,890 --> 01:06:04,726
I talked to Randall
about approving your promotion.

1654
01:06:04,728 --> 01:06:06,861
- You did.
- Mm-hmm.

1655
01:06:06,863 --> 01:06:07,862
That's wonderful.

1656
01:06:07,864 --> 01:06:09,197
Look, don't
thank me yet

1657
01:06:09,199 --> 01:06:10,332
but I convinced him
to give you a bonus

1658
01:06:10,334 --> 01:06:12,434
when the deal goes
through.

1659
01:06:12,436 --> 01:06:15,704
We need to make
a little side deal.

1660
01:06:15,706 --> 01:06:18,006
Of course, what is it?

1661
01:06:18,008 --> 01:06:21,810
Well, when the deal goes
through, I need at least half.

1662
01:06:21,812 --> 01:06:24,212
Randall is so slick.

1663
01:06:24,214 --> 01:06:27,048
See, he has me in this
little prenup

1664
01:06:27,050 --> 01:06:29,117
that's so ironclad shut.

1665
01:06:29,119 --> 01:06:32,354
He treats me like I'm a
teenager and I'm a grown woman.

1666
01:06:32,356 --> 01:06:35,357
I need zeros behind
my bank account.

1667
01:06:35,359 --> 01:06:36,491
You know what I mean?

1668
01:06:36,493 --> 01:06:39,527
I got you-- I guess,
you know, um...

1669
01:06:39,529 --> 01:06:42,497
Well, since you got me
the job, I guess I would

1670
01:06:42,499 --> 01:06:43,832
owe you something,
you know?

1671
01:06:43,834 --> 01:06:44,966
Good, exactly.

1672
01:06:44,968 --> 01:06:46,468
I knew you'd
see it my way.

1673
01:06:46,470 --> 01:06:49,471
So I'm gonna have my lawyer
draw up the contracts.

1674
01:06:49,473 --> 01:06:51,639
Contracts?

1675
01:06:55,144 --> 01:06:56,478
Look, pumpkin,

1676
01:06:56,480 --> 01:07:01,483
let's not get business
and fun mixed up.

1677
01:07:01,485 --> 01:07:04,386
Okay?

1678
01:07:04,388 --> 01:07:07,522
You take care of me,
I'll take care of you.

Let's sit down here
a minute.

1701
01:09:00,971 --> 01:09:02,070
Sure.

1702
01:09:02,072 --> 01:09:04,172
- Ahh...
- Ohh...

1703
01:09:04,174 --> 01:09:07,275
Thank you for
the wonderful lunch.

1704
01:09:07,277 --> 01:09:10,512
Oh, but unfortunately, I have
to get back to this hell hole.

1705
01:09:10,514 --> 01:09:12,847
Well, I will admit,
our firm is a lot bigger,

1706
01:09:12,849 --> 01:09:15,583
nicer, more successful, of
course, and clean

1707
01:09:15,585 --> 01:09:16,851
but honestly,
you should be happy

1708
01:09:16,853 --> 01:09:19,521
because a lot of people
wish they had jobs.

1709
01:09:19,523 --> 01:09:22,223
Hmm, yeah, I guess--
I guess you're right.

1710
01:09:22,225 --> 01:09:23,725
But you-- I used to work
at a shoe department

1711
01:09:23,727 --> 01:09:25,560
at Dillard's
before I came here

1712
01:09:25,562 --> 01:09:27,395
but I don't feel like
going back to those

1713
01:09:27,397 --> 01:09:29,397
stank feet and those
stank attitudes all day.

1714
01:09:29,399 --> 01:09:30,565
Mmm, I hear that.

1715
01:09:30,567 --> 01:09:32,867
Well, hey, just as
a side note, my firm

1716
01:09:32,869 --> 01:09:35,503
Peterson, Lewis and Kramer is
expanding into the Midwest

1717
01:09:35,505 --> 01:09:38,306
and we are aggressively
seeking new lawyers and talent

1718
01:09:38,308 --> 01:09:41,142
so just wanna put that
bug in your ear.

1719
01:09:41,144 --> 01:09:42,343
Well, this bug is buzzing.

1720
01:09:42,345 --> 01:09:43,745
( laughing )

1721
01:09:43,747 --> 01:09:44,612
But, you know...

1722
01:09:44,614 --> 01:09:46,181
my boss has been
real good to me

1723
01:09:46,183 --> 01:09:51,252
and not a lot of bosses would
give you a two-hour lunch break.

1724
01:09:51,254 --> 01:09:55,023
Um, so, um...

1725
01:09:55,025 --> 01:09:57,992
Will I see you--
will I see you again?

1726
01:10:00,596 --> 01:10:01,729
I don't mean to be rude,

1727
01:10:01,731 --> 01:10:06,034
but that is a mighty
stupid question.

1728
01:10:06,036 --> 01:10:07,635
What's your credit score?

1729
01:10:07,637 --> 01:10:09,571
800.

1730
01:10:11,407 --> 01:10:13,441
Well, I guess
I'll call you later.

1731
01:10:13,443 --> 01:10:16,311
- Mmm, you do that.
- Un-huh.

1732
01:10:16,313 --> 01:10:19,547
( mumbling )

1733
01:10:19,549 --> 01:10:21,983
( chuckling )

1734
01:10:26,355 --> 01:10:28,056
Sir, you want to
see me?

1735
01:10:28,058 --> 01:10:29,524
Yeah, have a seat.

1736
01:10:34,663 --> 01:10:37,031
You've been knowing me
a long time, am I right?

1737
01:10:37,033 --> 01:10:39,634
- Yes, sir.
- Good.

1738
01:10:39,636 --> 01:10:41,736
I'm not gonna
beat around the bush.

1739
01:10:41,738 --> 01:10:43,471
What are you trying to
accomplish by

1740
01:10:43,473 --> 01:10:49,310
dealing with my wife?

1741
01:10:49,312 --> 01:10:51,112
Sir, I'm not trying
to accomplish--

1742
01:10:51,114 --> 01:10:53,414
Save it,
save it, save it.

1743
01:10:53,416 --> 01:10:56,551
Your number came up
on her cell phone.

1744
01:10:56,553 --> 01:10:59,220
What's going on?

1745
01:10:59,222 --> 01:11:01,322
Sir, there's
nothing going on.

1746
01:11:01,324 --> 01:11:03,691
Let me tell you something.

1747
01:11:03,693 --> 01:11:06,594
I want you to
really hear me.

1748
01:11:06,596 --> 01:11:09,831
My wife is a nice lady.

1749
01:11:09,833 --> 01:11:11,899
Young...

1750
01:11:11,901 --> 01:11:15,236
naive, very kind.

1751
01:11:15,238 --> 01:11:16,471
And whatever
you're trying to do

1752
01:11:16,473 --> 01:11:18,973
by going around me
to get to her,

1753
01:11:18,975 --> 01:11:20,041
- is not--
- Sir--

1754
01:11:20,043 --> 01:11:21,876
It's not going
to work.

1755
01:11:21,878 --> 01:11:24,279
You understand me?

1756
01:11:24,281 --> 01:11:26,648
I'm the boss here.

1757
01:11:26,650 --> 01:11:29,951
When I make decisions,
they're final.

1758
01:11:29,953 --> 01:11:32,553
You understand?

1759
01:11:32,555 --> 01:11:36,924
So go back to your
office and get to work.

1760
01:11:36,926 --> 01:11:40,495
That's the last thing
I'm gonna say.

1761
01:11:48,904 --> 01:11:50,305
( door closing )

1762
01:11:50,307 --> 01:11:53,274
Out of all the days I choose to
leave my wallet in my gym shorts

1763
01:11:53,276 --> 01:11:54,909
I choose today to do it.

1764
01:11:54,911 --> 01:11:56,477
It's okay.

1765
01:11:56,479 --> 01:11:58,546
Gosh, they said we can
get on the next flight out.

1766
01:11:58,548 --> 01:12:00,281
Don't beat yourself up.

1767
01:12:00,283 --> 01:12:01,616
Beat myself up?

1768
01:12:01,618 --> 01:12:03,217
I've been beat up enough
for the last few years.

1769
01:12:03,219 --> 01:12:05,853
And you don't ever have to worry
about me beating myself up.

1770
01:12:05,855 --> 01:12:07,555
- Jarvis.
- Um-- oh, you
know what?

1771
01:12:07,557 --> 01:12:08,823
Have a seat, look.

1772
01:12:08,825 --> 01:12:10,224
I gotta holler
at Elston real quick.

1773
01:12:10,226 --> 01:12:11,426
I left my SpongeBob
pillowcase at his crib.

1774
01:12:11,428 --> 01:12:12,627
I gotta get it.

1775
01:12:12,629 --> 01:12:14,495
- I can't fly without it.
- SpongeBob?

1776
01:12:14,497 --> 01:12:15,730
Yeah, SpongeBob.

1777
01:12:15,732 --> 01:12:17,031
- There we go.
- I'll be back, babe.

1778
01:12:17,033 --> 01:12:18,833
Okay, I'll be here.

1779
01:12:18,835 --> 01:12:19,934
Okay.

1780
01:12:19,936 --> 01:12:21,302
( knocking )

1781
01:12:21,304 --> 01:12:23,504
Come in.

1782
01:12:25,674 --> 01:12:27,141
Elston, what's wrong?

1783
01:12:27,143 --> 01:12:29,310
I came right over as soon
as I got the message.

1784
01:12:29,312 --> 01:12:30,611
Thank you for coming.

1785
01:12:30,613 --> 01:12:32,580
You look upset,
what's wrong?

1786
01:12:32,582 --> 01:12:35,083
I should've never
started this with you.

1787
01:12:36,585 --> 01:12:38,720
Come on, don't
tell me--

1788
01:12:38,722 --> 01:12:40,254
- Listen.
- You getting
cold feet.

1789
01:12:40,256 --> 01:12:41,556
We're just getting
started.

1790
01:12:41,558 --> 01:12:43,991
Vanessa, I've been
putting my job on the line.

1791
01:12:43,993 --> 01:12:45,993
I've been lying and
deceiving people,

1792
01:12:45,995 --> 01:12:47,562
walking around here.

1793
01:12:47,564 --> 01:12:49,931
- This is not who I am.
- What?

1794
01:12:49,933 --> 01:12:52,166
You think I put a gun to your
head and made you do this?

1795
01:12:52,168 --> 01:12:54,235
- You wanted this just
as bad as I did.
- Vanessa...

1796
01:12:54,237 --> 01:12:56,604
Vanessa, I
can't do this!

1797
01:12:56,606 --> 01:13:00,074
I cannot do this, this
is not who I am.

1798
01:13:00,076 --> 01:13:01,843
So you think it's
that easy.

1799
01:13:01,845 --> 01:13:05,279
You're just gonna stand right
there and say that you're done?

1800
01:13:05,281 --> 01:13:06,748
No, I'm not an old toy.

1801
01:13:06,750 --> 01:13:09,851
You can't just toss me aside
like I'm a piece of dirt!

1802
01:13:09,853 --> 01:13:12,954
I never said you
were an old toy, Vanessa.

1803
01:13:12,956 --> 01:13:14,255
Listen...

1804
01:13:14,257 --> 01:13:15,690
You're gonna
listen to me

1805
01:13:15,692 --> 01:13:17,892
and you're gonna do exactly
what I say to do.

1806
01:13:17,894 --> 01:13:19,794
Otherwise, I'm gonna
ruin your career at this firm

1807
01:13:19,796 --> 01:13:24,132
and you will never make
another dime again.

1808
01:13:24,134 --> 01:13:26,434
Now, Elston, I need
you to sign that contract

1809
01:13:26,436 --> 01:13:28,069
and I need you to
sign it now.

1810
01:13:28,071 --> 01:13:29,237
Get out!

1811
01:13:29,239 --> 01:13:32,273
Get out, now!

1812
01:13:32,275 --> 01:13:34,942
( Sheila )
You heard the man,
you heard him.

1813
01:13:34,944 --> 01:13:36,277
Get out.

1814
01:13:36,279 --> 01:13:38,746
Boy, man, I thought
I was devious, but you?

1815
01:13:38,748 --> 01:13:40,214
You take the cake, honey,

1816
01:13:40,216 --> 01:13:41,949
and all that money you gave me,
I'm giving it back.

1817
01:13:41,951 --> 01:13:44,385
- This--
- I'm no longer
into that.

1818
01:13:44,387 --> 01:13:45,853
My life is a parade.

1819
01:13:45,855 --> 01:13:47,221
- Parade?
- Long story.

1820
01:13:47,223 --> 01:13:48,389
You know what?

1821
01:13:48,391 --> 01:13:51,058
This isn't over.

1822
01:13:54,129 --> 01:13:55,196
( door closing )

1823
01:13:55,198 --> 01:13:56,731
You know we gotta
tell him, right?

1824
01:13:56,733 --> 01:13:59,734
- Are you out
of your mind?
- Mrs. Simmons?

1825
01:13:59,736 --> 01:14:01,335
- Pinkie toe?
- Mm-hmm.

1826
01:14:01,337 --> 01:14:03,204
She's my sister in
the Lord now, you know.

1827
01:14:03,206 --> 01:14:04,939
And she always
says that the Bible says:

1828
01:14:04,941 --> 01:14:08,476
"First go and be reconciled
with your brother."

1829
01:14:08,478 --> 01:14:11,579
Sheila, how can you be quoting
the Bible at a time like this?

1830
01:14:11,581 --> 01:14:12,680
Yeah, I know.

1831
01:14:12,682 --> 01:14:14,115
But it's never too late,
you know,

1832
01:14:14,117 --> 01:14:16,284
even with a past
as long and colorful as mine.

1833
01:14:16,286 --> 01:14:17,852
Yes, very long
and colorful.

1834
01:14:17,854 --> 01:14:19,654
Come on now, we gotta go, now,
come on, stand up.

1835
01:14:19,656 --> 01:14:21,055
Come on,
hold your head up.

1836
01:14:21,057 --> 01:14:23,958
Man up and let's go.

1837
01:14:23,960 --> 01:14:26,160
Elston.

1838
01:14:35,003 --> 01:14:38,172
Sheila, you know
I love you like a sister.

1839
01:14:38,174 --> 01:14:39,841
I love you too.

1840
01:14:39,843 --> 01:14:41,209
And I'm gonna
miss you.

1841
01:14:41,211 --> 01:14:42,410
I'm gonna miss you too.

1842
01:14:42,412 --> 01:14:44,212
( chuckling )

1843
01:14:47,649 --> 01:14:50,351
All right, let's go.

1844
01:14:55,657 --> 01:14:58,559
- Hey.
- Hey, uh...

1845
01:14:58,561 --> 01:15:00,561
I'm busy right now
doing some reading.

1846
01:15:00,563 --> 01:15:02,663
Can this wait?

1847
01:15:02,665 --> 01:15:04,699
No, sir, it cannot.

1848
01:15:08,103 --> 01:15:09,971
What's the problem?

1849
01:15:12,074 --> 01:15:13,908
Okay, um...

1850
01:15:13,910 --> 01:15:16,277
I'm just gonna go
ahead and say it, um...

1851
01:15:19,681 --> 01:15:22,350
I've been having an affair
with your wife.

1852
01:15:22,352 --> 01:15:24,652
( chuckling )

1853
01:15:26,088 --> 01:15:28,022
Is that what you
came here to tell me?

1854
01:15:28,024 --> 01:15:30,691
Is this-- is this some--
some kind of game?

1855
01:15:30,693 --> 01:15:32,126
Some kind of
scam or something?

1856
01:15:32,128 --> 01:15:33,928
Because my wife wouldn't
do anything like that.

1857
01:15:33,930 --> 01:15:37,899
No, no, no, I helped them too
and I'm ashamed of it.

1858
01:15:37,901 --> 01:15:40,601
And they didn't
even pay that much.

1859
01:15:40,603 --> 01:15:45,840
This-- this-- this is a joke,
this is not true, okay, so...

1860
01:15:47,743 --> 01:15:50,378
Of course, this
isn't true.

1861
01:15:50,380 --> 01:15:54,181
Oh.

1862
01:15:54,183 --> 01:15:56,684
Okay, listen...

1863
01:15:56,686 --> 01:15:57,919
Why would you do
something like that?

1864
01:15:57,921 --> 01:16:00,454
I treated you like
my own son.

1865
01:16:00,456 --> 01:16:02,523
Yes, Elston, why would you
do something like this?

1866
01:16:02,525 --> 01:16:05,259
Sir, I don't
know why I did it

1867
01:16:05,261 --> 01:16:06,561
but I did it, okay,

1868
01:16:06,563 --> 01:16:08,896
and...

1869
01:16:08,898 --> 01:16:11,065
I'm so sorry.

1870
01:16:11,067 --> 01:16:13,801
I disappointed myself,
I disappointed you

1871
01:16:13,803 --> 01:16:16,404
and I'm ashamed.

1872
01:16:16,406 --> 01:16:21,542
And I'm willing to
suffer the consequences, sir.

1873
01:16:21,544 --> 01:16:22,577
I'm so sorry.

1874
01:16:22,579 --> 01:16:23,844
Is this true?

1875
01:16:23,846 --> 01:16:27,181
Of course it's not true,
for goodness sakes.

1876
01:16:27,183 --> 01:16:29,584
I treated you like a queen,
is this true?

1877
01:16:29,586 --> 01:16:30,718
( Jarvis )
Oh, come on, man.

1878
01:16:30,720 --> 01:16:33,187
Yo, tell me this
is a lie, E.

1879
01:16:33,189 --> 01:16:36,524
We was about to
get a promotion.

1880
01:16:36,526 --> 01:16:37,959
I have here on
my phone

1881
01:16:37,961 --> 01:16:40,094
all the pictures and text
messages that she sent--

1882
01:16:40,096 --> 01:16:41,562
- Give me that!
- No, no, no...

1883
01:16:41,564 --> 01:16:44,298
( stammering )

1884
01:16:44,300 --> 01:16:46,834
Jezebel!

1885
01:16:46,836 --> 01:16:48,970
I'm sorry, sir.

1886
01:16:50,839 --> 01:16:55,109
Why would
you do this to me?

1887
01:16:55,111 --> 01:16:59,046
You're gonna stand here
and lie about it.

1888
01:16:59,048 --> 01:17:01,015
Wow.

1889
01:17:04,753 --> 01:17:07,722
I want you out of here.

1890
01:17:07,724 --> 01:17:10,458
Talk to my lawyer
in the morning.

1891
01:17:10,460 --> 01:17:12,860
Go to my house.

1892
01:17:12,862 --> 01:17:17,465
Give your keys
to my housekeeper.

1893
01:17:17,467 --> 01:17:20,101
You're the worst.

1894
01:17:21,737 --> 01:17:23,471
As for you...

1895
01:17:23,473 --> 01:17:25,006

01:26:02,690 --> 01:26:04,892
What is it?

2069
01:26:04,894 --> 01:26:06,960
Open it.

2070
01:26:16,271 --> 01:26:19,006
It's a check.

2071
01:26:19,008 --> 01:26:23,210
Sir, this is, uh...

2072
01:26:23,212 --> 01:26:25,546
this is very generous, sir,
but I can't take this.

2073
01:26:25,548 --> 01:26:29,249
No, I want you to take it.

2074
01:26:29,251 --> 01:26:31,051
Remember...

2075
01:26:31,053 --> 01:26:33,020
Do I owe you
something?

2076
01:26:33,022 --> 01:26:34,888
Remember that?

2077
01:26:34,890 --> 01:26:36,223
Yup.

2078
01:26:36,225 --> 01:26:37,558
Well, I want you to know

2079
01:26:37,560 --> 01:26:40,694
you did a great job in
helping me build my firm.

2080
01:26:40,696 --> 01:26:43,297
So I'm not giving you that.

2081
01:26:43,299 --> 01:26:44,831
You earned it.

2082
01:26:50,872 --> 01:26:53,640
I'll let myself out.

2083
01:26:53,642 --> 01:26:55,976
Sir...

2084
01:26:58,913 --> 01:27:01,448
Thank you.

2085
01:27:01,450 --> 01:27:05,252
I know that I can't
do anything to make...

2086
01:27:05,254 --> 01:27:08,322
the past right again but
I'll do everything

2087
01:27:08,324 --> 01:27:11,225
to make it
right in the future.

2088
01:27:11,227 --> 01:27:15,362
Yeah... maybe.

2089
01:27:15,364 --> 01:27:19,299
Maybe after this all
passes, who knows?

2090
01:27:19,301 --> 01:27:22,069
Maybe one day
we'll be friends again.

2091
01:27:22,071 --> 01:27:26,139
Maybe.

2092
01:27:26,141 --> 01:27:29,343
But right
now, I've gotta go

2093
01:27:29,345 --> 01:27:32,913
and put my life
back together.
