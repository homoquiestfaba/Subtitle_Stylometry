[Camera Operator] Camera,

00:01:47,892 --> 00:01:49,225
[Interviewer] So, Jason,

10
00:01:49,227 --> 00:01:51,126
how do you feel about your
first Oscar nomination?

11
00:01:51,128 --> 00:01:52,928
I'm grateful for
the nomination,

12
00:01:52,930 --> 00:01:54,363
and honored to be amongst
some of the most talented

13
00:01:54,365 --> 00:01:56,298
people of all time.

14
00:01:56,300 --> 00:01:57,600
But in all honesty,

15
00:01:57,602 --> 00:01:59,068
I don't think any of
this really matters.

16
00:01:59,070 --> 00:02:00,903
It's, it's not why I do it.

17
00:02:00,905 --> 00:02:02,103
[Interviewer]
So, wait a minute,

18
00:02:02,105 --> 00:02:03,304
are you saying you're not
happy about the nomination?

19
00:02:03,307 --> 00:02:04,607
No, not at all.

20
00:02:04,609 --> 00:02:08,010
But it doesn't make me any
better than anyone else.

21
00:02:08,012 --> 00:02:10,446
I never wanted the
fame, even as a kid.

22
00:02:10,448 --> 00:02:11,947
I was just never comfortable
with the attention

23
00:02:11,949 --> 00:02:14,116
that came outside of the work.

24
00:02:14,118 --> 00:02:15,517
I think it's sad
that people care more

25
00:02:15,519 --> 00:02:17,653
about celebrities than
what's going on in the world.

26
00:02:17,655 --> 00:02:18,654
[Interviewer] But
that's Hollywood.

27
00:02:18,656 --> 00:02:20,388
You know how the business works.

28
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:22,123
Oh, I know exactly
how the business works,

29
00:02:22,126 --> 00:02:24,493
and the business
needs to change.

30
00:02:24,495 --> 00:02:26,444

- There he is! Jason!

You need to come out now,

All right, I know
you hate this crap,

56
00:03:43,674 --> 00:03:44,974
but you don't have to
stay out there for long,

00:03:44,976 --> 00:03:46,608

Give me a break, Steve.

65
00:04:17,675 --> 00:04:19,274
Just put her on the
fucking cover with Jason.

66
00:04:19,276 --> 00:04:20,709
Heather Hayes is
the new it girl.

I'm telling you right now.

68
00:04:22,113 --> 00:04:23,045
Well, if you don't,

69
00:04:23,047 --> 00:04:23,779
you're not getting the interview

70
00:04:23,781 --> 00:04:25,180
with Jason, and that would suck.

'Cause everyone
wants him right now.

72
00:04:26,684 --> 00:04:30,152
He's nominated for a fucking
Oscar, for Christ's sake.

You know, I have to
go. Call me Monday.

Let me see those

76
00:04:34,759 --> 00:04:36,025
Not yours.

Come here, come here.

78
00:04:37,678 --> 00:04:39,328
Come here. You look a
little tired, all right?

79
00:04:39,330 --> 00:04:41,030
So fix yourself up a bit.

I told you no! I mean it, Steve.

No cover, no interview.
You look thin.

87
00:04:56,714 --> 00:04:58,213
It's the drugs.

88
00:04:58,215 --> 00:04:59,114
Oh, shut up. I thought
you stopped all that shit.

89
00:04:59,116 --> 00:05:00,381
I did.

90
00:05:00,383 --> 00:05:01,648
Yeah, and what was the deal
with that boy's trip to Miami?

91
00:05:01,650 --> 00:05:02,915
You see the pictures?
They're everywhere.

92
00:05:02,917 --> 00:05:04,183

making the kind of money

93

you're making or not?

00:05:05,122 --> 00:05:06,355
I'm gonna do what I do.

I don't give a
shit what you do.

96
00:05:07,825 --> 00:05:09,190
Just don't do it in public
places where they can

97
00:05:09,192 --> 00:05:10,558
take pictures and put it
in all those magazines.

98
00:05:10,561 --> 00:05:11,794
Okay?

99
00:05:11,796 --> 00:05:13,295
You know, you could've
gotten a supporting

had taken it all, mm,

101
00:05:14,799 --> 00:05:17,199

like I told you.

to party in your room?

No, no, no, no, no!

00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:31,146
- I missed you, dick.
- [grunts] Okay

109
00:05:31,148 --> 00:05:32,081
How long have I been telling
you this was gonna happen,

110
00:05:32,083 --> 00:05:33,248
since you were what, like 16?

111
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:34,316
I'm so proud of you.

112
00:05:34,318 --> 00:05:35,818
It's handled.

113
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:38,087
Marissa's sending the pictures
of you guys to the Enquirer.

Wait? That secret
engagement crap?

No, it's you and
Alyssa fighting,

116
00:05:41,092 --> 00:05:42,674
making up, blah, blah, blah.

117
00:05:42,676 --> 00:05:44,259

best publicist, did I not?

You know, it is all
gonna come out eventually.

119
00:05:45,763 --> 00:05:47,195
And you embarrassed the shit
out of me with those pictures.

120
00:05:47,197 --> 00:05:48,630
You didn't even tell me
you were going to Miami.

I don't have to tell
you everything I do.

- We'll be right out.
- Fine.

00:06:07,852 --> 00:06:09,585

I never got your messages.

- Why?
- Because I wanna look

144
00:06:40,351 --> 00:06:43,652
- into your eyes, bro.
- What the fuck? What...

answer your phone! Come on, baby.

I know we haven't talked
in a really long time,

152
00:07:00,671 --> 00:07:02,171
but I want to see you.

153
00:07:04,275 --> 00:07:05,890
Mommy's back on
the scene, huh?

154
00:07:05,892 --> 00:07:07,508
Yeah, she's been
calling me non-stop, dude.

155
00:07:07,511 --> 00:07:09,178
Don't let her
get to you. Okay?

156
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:11,713
You're an Oscar-nominated actor
now. You made this happen.

157
00:07:11,715 --> 00:07:12,948
She didn't.

158
00:07:12,950 --> 00:07:13,749
You should have
been nominated too.

159
00:07:13,751 --> 00:07:14,950
You killed it up there.

160
00:07:14,952 --> 00:07:17,953
This isn't about
me. This is about you.

161
00:07:17,955 --> 00:07:19,922
Look, I know you
hate all this shit,

162
00:07:19,924 --> 00:07:21,857
but let's just go out there
and have some fun tonight.

163
00:07:21,859 --> 00:07:23,192
Huh?

164
00:07:23,194 --> 00:07:25,360
Tonight isn't
about having fun.

165
00:07:28,199 --> 00:07:29,398
Whoa, so you're still
going through with it?

166
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:30,365
Of course.

167
00:07:31,835 --> 00:07:33,435
Are all the security
cameras set up?

168
00:07:33,437 --> 00:07:35,204
They were tested this morning.

169
00:07:35,206 --> 00:07:37,272
They're in every
room of the house.

170
00:07:38,209 --> 00:07:39,975
Is Jack definitely coming?

171
00:07:39,977 --> 00:07:42,911
Celeste said he was confirmed.

172
00:07:42,913 --> 00:07:45,247
I'm not leaving this
room until it's done.

173
00:07:46,383 --> 00:07:48,517
You know what this
is gonna do to Alyssa?

174
00:07:50,487 --> 00:07:52,287
We'll get her through it.

175
00:07:57,361 --> 00:07:59,628
Man, are you sure you want
to go through with all of this?

176
00:08:01,232 --> 00:08:03,765
Yes. I have to do this.

177
00:08:03,767 --> 00:08:07,402
I, I can't keep hold on to
it, man, it's killing me.

178
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:10,772
Man, can't you
just let it all go?

179
00:08:12,376 --> 00:08:13,275
Can you?

180
00:08:15,879 --> 00:08:18,547
- [knocking]
- Hey, bro. It's Dylan.

181
00:08:18,549 --> 00:08:20,782
I'm holding down the fort,
but it is madness out here.

182
00:08:20,784 --> 00:08:22,017
I'm coming back
in a few minutes,

183
00:08:22,019 --> 00:08:24,519
and I will drag your
ass out if I have to!!

184
00:08:24,521 --> 00:08:27,823
Hey, yo, baby, wait
up! What's your name?

185
00:08:27,825 --> 00:08:31,593
Dylan doesn't know, so
don't say anything to him.

186
00:08:31,595 --> 00:08:33,328
He's not going to be
able to handle it.

187
00:08:34,598 --> 00:08:37,899
Okay. Hey, look at me.

188
00:08:40,504 --> 00:08:41,870
No hard drugs tonight, right?

189
00:08:41,872 --> 00:08:43,405
- I know.
- No. I mean it.

190
00:08:43,407 --> 00:08:44,973
I know. You too.

191
00:08:46,377 --> 00:08:48,977
Man, I told you in Vegas,
I'm done with all that shit.

192
00:08:48,979 --> 00:08:51,380
I haven't touched it since.
[knocking]

193
00:08:51,382 --> 00:08:53,582
[Celeste] Jason. Jack
Rossi just got here.

194
00:08:53,584 --> 00:08:56,318
We have a surprise
for you. Come on out!

195
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:58,987
[Ryan] We'll be right
out! Hey, hey, hey, hey.

196
00:08:58,989 --> 00:09:00,338
Hey.

197
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:01,690
Let's just go out there
for a little bit, huh?

198
00:09:01,692 --> 00:09:02,991
Try to enjoy yourself,
just a little, will ya?

199
00:09:02,993 --> 00:09:05,327
Do one round with me, hm?

200
00:09:05,329 --> 00:09:06,394
One round with me,

201
00:09:06,396 --> 00:09:07,462
then you can come back in
here and hide for the rest

202
00:09:07,464 --> 00:09:08,664
of the night, okay?

203
00:09:08,666 --> 00:09:13,702
Yeah? [laughs] Jason
Mast, everybody!

204
00:09:14,772 --> 00:09:16,338
[Jack] Where's
the man of the hour?

205
00:09:17,775 --> 00:09:19,508
[Voices] Jason. Jason.

206
00:09:19,510 --> 00:09:20,776
Jason. Jason.

207
00:09:20,778 --> 00:09:22,544
Jason. Jason.

208
00:09:22,546 --> 00:09:23,378

- [knocking]
- Hey. It's Alyssa.

219
00:10:13,097 --> 00:10:15,864
Jason! Get the fuck up!

220
00:10:15,866 --> 00:10:17,165
Okay! Oh, god!

221
00:10:17,167 --> 00:10:18,467
It's a fucking party.
Are you seriously sleeping?

222
00:10:18,469 --> 00:10:19,067
Jason! Heather just arrived.

223
00:10:19,069 --> 00:10:20,585
She was looking for you.

224
00:10:20,587 --> 00:10:22,104
Hey, girl. Don't
you look fabulous.

225
00:10:22,106 --> 00:10:26,007
So do you! [laughs] I'm
so happy for you, babe!

226
00:10:26,009 --> 00:10:27,809
- Congratulations.
- Thanks.

227
00:10:27,811 --> 00:10:29,811
You're totally gonna win.

228
00:10:29,813 --> 00:10:31,880
I love the new script changes
that you made, by the way.

229
00:10:31,882 --> 00:10:34,716
I, I just, I keep reading
them over and over again,

230
00:10:34,718 --> 00:10:36,385
and I just, I cry every time.

231
00:10:36,387 --> 00:10:38,487
I mean, people know that
you are a great actor,

232
00:10:38,489 --> 00:10:40,122
but when they realize
that you wrote this!

233
00:10:40,124 --> 00:10:41,723
- Okay! [laughs]
- Oh, my God.

234
00:10:41,725 --> 00:10:43,091
I, I'm really sorry.

235
00:10:43,093 --> 00:10:44,542
It's cool.

236
00:10:44,544 --> 00:10:45,994
I just really connect
to this part and I know

237
00:10:45,996 --> 00:10:47,929
you're still looking
for the financing...

238
00:10:47,931 --> 00:10:50,132
- Oh, no he's not.
- What?

239
00:10:50,134 --> 00:10:52,167
I wanted to surprise you.
Jack Rossi has come on board.

240
00:10:52,169 --> 00:10:55,570
He's fully financing
your project. It's done.

241
00:10:55,572 --> 00:10:59,408
Why didn't you tell me
earlier? Uh, excuse me, please.

242
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:04,679
What the fuck?
Jack Rossi, really?

243
00:11:04,681 --> 00:11:06,481
You wanted it done,
and I got it done.

244
00:11:06,483 --> 00:11:07,482
You could be filming by summer,

245
00:11:07,484 --> 00:11:09,818
and he's financing it himself.

246
00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:11,620
You wrote it, you're
starring in it,

247
00:11:11,622 --> 00:11:14,189
it's your movie and
everyone's gonna know it.

248
00:11:14,191 --> 00:11:15,791
Whatever issues
you have with him,

249
00:11:15,793 --> 00:11:18,593
let it go and take
the fucking money.

250
00:11:21,598 --> 00:11:22,864
Jason doesn't want me
in the movie, does he?

251
00:11:22,866 --> 00:11:24,682
He's gonna cast that
new Gwyneth girl,

252
00:11:24,684 --> 00:11:26,501
or Cameron, or Winona, because
everyone just wants Winona.

253
00:11:26,503 --> 00:11:27,469
Will you stop it?

254
00:11:27,471 --> 00:11:28,814
Now, I can't leave the show.

255
00:11:28,816 --> 00:11:30,159
So let's just tell Jack
that I'm signing on,

256
00:11:30,161 --> 00:11:31,505
I'll do one more
season, or something.

257
00:11:31,508 --> 00:11:33,008
I don't want to hear
another word about that show.

258
00:11:33,010 --> 00:11:34,643
You are bigger than TV now.

259
00:11:34,645 --> 00:11:38,914
Do you want to be a
movie star, or what? Hey.

260
00:11:38,916 --> 00:11:41,983
How much do you
love your new nose?

261
00:11:41,985 --> 00:11:44,519
I love it. I
feel a lot better.

262
00:11:44,521 --> 00:11:46,822
Yeah, all right look.
I will handle Jack Rossi.

263
00:11:46,824 --> 00:11:49,057
You just worry about Jason.
Don't leave his side tonight.

264
00:11:49,059 --> 00:11:50,491
Like I told you,

265
00:11:50,493 --> 00:11:51,926
Jason is all about chemistry
and I want him to feel

266
00:11:51,929 --> 00:11:54,912
the chemistry between you two.

267
00:11:54,914 --> 00:11:57,898
Now, go make him notice you.
Stand up, you're slouching.

268
00:12:00,037 --> 00:12:02,003
Hey. I've been looking
all over for you.

269
00:12:02,005 --> 00:12:04,506
You just left me. I
don't know anyone here.

270
00:12:04,508 --> 00:12:05,974
I was standing there all
awkward, like an idiot.

271
00:12:05,976 --> 00:12:07,209
People started giving
me drink their orders.

272
00:12:07,211 --> 00:12:08,810
Why is he here?

273
00:12:08,812 --> 00:12:10,145
Heather, I have told
you a million times,

274
00:12:10,147 --> 00:12:11,580
publicly, you're single.

275
00:12:11,582 --> 00:12:12,697
If you care about her career,

276
00:12:12,699 --> 00:12:13,815
stay away from
her for the night.

277
00:12:13,817 --> 00:12:15,484
Or you could just leave.
[phone rings]

278
00:12:15,486 --> 00:12:17,686
You know, we have
work to do here.

279
00:12:17,688 --> 00:12:20,689
What? No, no, I can
barely hear you.

280
00:12:20,691 --> 00:12:22,958
Y'know, let me call
you from the landline.

281
00:12:24,595 --> 00:12:26,828
So, do you wanna
go back to the party?

282
00:12:26,830 --> 00:12:28,530
Or we could just
stand here staring

283
00:12:28,532 --> 00:12:29,797
at Jason Mast all night.

284
00:12:29,799 --> 00:12:31,065
[Heather] Brody, I told you
that tonight's all about work.

285
00:12:31,068 --> 00:12:32,267
[Alyssa] Why are you here?

286
00:12:32,269 --> 00:12:34,569
Alyssa, stop flirting with me.

287
00:12:34,571 --> 00:12:36,738
God, you wish. Heather,
come to the bathroom with me.

288
00:12:36,740 --> 00:12:38,573
I need to talk to
you for a minute.

289
00:12:42,012 --> 00:12:44,145
Hey, man. I'm Brody.

290
00:12:44,147 --> 00:12:46,014
I'm Heather Hayes' boyfriend.

291
00:12:46,016 --> 00:12:46,915
Oh. Hi.

292
00:12:50,687 --> 00:12:53,555
It's so nice to meet
you. I'm a big, big fan.

293
00:12:54,291 --> 00:12:56,525
I've seen all your
movies. [laughs]

294
00:12:56,527 --> 00:12:58,159
I watched "Boys of Summer",
like, 100 times in high school.

295
00:12:58,161 --> 00:13:01,296
Me and my buddies quote
that all the time.

296
00:13:01,298 --> 00:13:03,532
That's cool. Cool, cool.

297
00:13:05,569 --> 00:13:06,701
[Brody] It's a great
place you got here, man.

298
00:13:06,703 --> 00:13:09,137
Thank you for letting me come.

299
00:13:09,139 --> 00:13:10,572
Oh, no problem.

300
00:13:10,574 --> 00:13:11,806
[Brody] Great views.

301
00:13:12,943 --> 00:13:14,009
Thank you.

302
00:13:15,812 --> 00:13:17,045
Hey, I'm a writer!

303
00:13:19,016 --> 00:13:20,215
Uh... Oh!

304
00:13:20,217 --> 00:13:21,583
Okay.

305
00:13:21,585 --> 00:13:23,251
Oh, um, y'know
actually, I have a script.

306
00:13:23,253 --> 00:13:24,653
It's, um, it's a lot like
"Boys of Summer", a coming

307
00:13:24,655 --> 00:13:27,155
of age story,
y'know, and uh, um...

308
00:13:29,293 --> 00:13:31,026
That was so stupid...

309
00:13:33,130 --> 00:13:36,998
I'm a writer, coming of age
story, like you give a shit.

310
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,700
How lame was that, huh?

311
00:13:38,702 --> 00:13:40,068
Hey, giant movie
star, I'm a nobody,

312
00:13:40,070 --> 00:13:42,037
let me tell you about
my awesome new script.

313
00:13:43,774 --> 00:13:45,707
Shut-up, Brody. [laughs]

314
00:13:46,677 --> 00:13:48,159
Bit of a nervous talker,

315
00:13:48,161 --> 00:13:49,644
that's probably why
I'm a writer, huh?

316
00:13:49,646 --> 00:13:51,328
Huh, huh?

317
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:53,013
I can see that.
I will see you...

318
00:13:53,016 --> 00:13:54,249
Got a cigarette?

319
00:13:55,686 --> 00:13:57,152
Sorry, I don't smoke.

320
00:13:57,154 --> 00:14:00,288
Pft, that's lame.
So, you in the biz?

321
00:14:00,290 --> 00:14:02,023
I feel like I've met you before.

322
00:14:02,025 --> 00:14:04,726
Did we got wasted
together at Drew's house?

323
00:14:04,728 --> 00:14:05,961
Never been to Drew's.

324
00:14:05,963 --> 00:14:08,263
Oh! She's so sweet.

325
00:14:08,265 --> 00:14:11,266
I know, it was backstage
at the Pumpkins show.

326
00:14:11,268 --> 00:14:12,233
Yeah, I don't listen to them.

327
00:14:12,235 --> 00:14:14,435
Oh, the Nirvana show?

328
00:14:14,437 --> 00:14:16,638
Uh, I don't know famous
people, I hate grunge music,

329
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:18,707
and we definitely
haven't met before.

330
00:14:18,709 --> 00:14:20,275
No, no, no, no. No!

331
00:14:20,277 --> 00:14:22,110
No drinking and you are leaving
by midnight. Give me that!

332
00:14:22,112 --> 00:14:24,713
A martini, really?
Where is your mother?

333
00:14:24,715 --> 00:14:26,381
By the pool. She's
already wasted.

334
00:14:26,383 --> 00:14:29,284
Figures. Did you
get a boob job?

335
00:14:29,286 --> 00:14:30,719
Do they look good?

336
00:14:30,721 --> 00:14:32,354
Pull this shit out.
You look ridiculous.

337
00:14:32,356 --> 00:14:34,255
You told me that
flat chested only works

338
00:14:34,257 --> 00:14:35,790
with modeling and I
would never get cast

339
00:14:35,792 --> 00:14:37,392
with that heroin-chic look.

340
00:14:37,394 --> 00:14:39,361
Right, and we will deal
with that when you are 18.

341
00:14:39,363 --> 00:14:41,329
My mom already made
me an appointment.

342
00:14:41,331 --> 00:14:42,263
And I'm canceling it.

343
00:14:42,265 --> 00:14:44,031
I'm in charge of the business

344
00:14:44,033 --> 00:14:45,800
that is Caley Miller, and
those tits are my business.

345
00:14:45,802 --> 00:14:46,935

obsessed with you.

Oh, you're very sweet.
I hope you stay that way.

I'm sorry, I don't know
who the fuck you are.

You've seen her billboard,
it's across from Chateau.

No, I'm too fucked
up to see anything

I'm a huge fan.

526
00:21:12,004 --> 00:21:13,420
I used to make my mom tape
your show, when I was a kid,

so I could watch
it over and over.

528

Me and my friends
totally wanted to be you.

529

died in that car accident,

00:28:24,887 --> 00:28:27,988
[heavy breathing]
[tense music]

691
00:28:38,034 --> 00:28:39,099
Down.

692
00:28:39,101 --> 00:28:40,601
Down! Give me 40.

693
00:28:43,172 --> 00:28:45,973
Jason, you need
to book this role.

694
00:28:45,975 --> 00:28:47,575
We all need this money.

695
00:28:48,678 --> 00:28:51,212
It's just you, me,
and Dylan now. Okay?

696
00:28:51,214 --> 00:28:55,783
We can't rely on your father
any more. He's not coming back.

697
00:28:57,487 --> 00:29:01,222
Which leaves you as
the man of the house.

698
00:29:01,224 --> 00:29:03,591
You can't be a
little girl any more.

699
00:29:05,595 --> 00:29:07,695
- Do you understand me?
- Yes.

700
00:29:08,898 --> 00:29:10,064
Keep going.

701
00:29:10,066 --> 00:29:12,666
- My arms are tired.
- Keep going!

702
00:29:14,237 --> 00:29:15,936
[Jason] Okay.

703
00:29:15,938 --> 00:29:18,672
Now, I want you to walk
into that audition and knock

704
00:29:18,674 --> 00:29:20,541
it out of the park.

705
00:29:23,112 --> 00:29:25,079
That a boy. Keep going.

706
00:29:26,182 --> 00:29:28,649
I love you, little man.
[heavy breathing]

707
00:29:38,761 --> 00:29:40,761
Well, congratulations.

708
00:29:40,763 --> 00:29:42,296
You know, I only
represent actors

709
00:29:42,298 --> 00:29:44,231
that I think have
real potential.

710
00:29:44,233 --> 00:29:46,634
And you? [laughs] You
got real potential.

711
00:29:46,636 --> 00:29:49,203
We are gonna make
you a star. Deal?

712
00:29:50,172 --> 00:29:52,540
- If you say so.
- I know so.

713
00:29:52,542 --> 00:29:55,276
[heart beating]

714
00:29:57,747 --> 00:30:00,147

722
00:31:33,175 --> 00:31:35,676
Caley, I saw you go in there.

723
00:31:35,678 --> 00:31:38,145
Your mother is looking for you.

724
00:31:38,147 --> 00:31:39,847
Your mother? How old are you?

725
00:31:39,849 --> 00:31:41,215
I'm 19.

726
00:31:41,217 --> 00:31:42,650
Then why is your mother here?

727
00:31:42,652 --> 00:31:44,218
She just likes to tag along.

728
00:31:44,220 --> 00:31:46,286
Caley, open this
door right now!

729
00:31:47,423 --> 00:31:50,791
Hey, loser, you know
she's 16 years old?

730
00:31:50,793 --> 00:31:51,925
You're 16?

731
00:31:51,927 --> 00:31:53,227
[Celeste] Okay, Caley, I guess

732
00:31:53,229 --> 00:31:54,662
I'll just have to
call your father,

733
00:31:54,664 --> 00:31:56,830
and he'll ship your ass
right back to Idaho.

734
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,266
Please don't.

735
00:31:59,268 --> 00:32:00,868
Let's go, let's go.
Go find your mother.

736
00:32:00,870 --> 00:32:02,703
I didn't know she was 16!

737
00:32:02,705 --> 00:32:04,171
When are you gonna
get your shit together

738
00:32:04,173 --> 00:32:06,140
and stop leaching
off your brother.

739
00:32:06,142 --> 00:32:07,808
You're gonna fuck up his career!

740
00:32:07,810 --> 00:32:09,910
He's always cleaning
up your messes.

741
00:32:09,912 --> 00:32:12,112
Jason would never tell you this,

742
00:32:12,114 --> 00:32:14,682
but you are an embarrassment.

743
00:32:14,684 --> 00:32:16,984
I don't care if you fuck
up your own life but don't

744
00:32:16,986 --> 00:32:18,686
fuck up his life too.

745
00:32:18,688 --> 00:32:20,821
No, go! Go, go now!

746
00:32:23,859 --> 00:32:24,807
Now!

747
00:32:24,809 --> 00:32:25,758
I'm a fuck up! I'm a fuck up!

748
00:32:25,761 --> 00:32:29,096
You piece of shit! [panting]

749
00:32:29,965 --> 00:32:30,964
Dylan? What are you doing?

750
00:32:30,966 --> 00:32:32,800
Put down the gun, Dylan, no!

751
00:32:32,802 --> 00:32:33,901
You're a loser.

752
00:32:33,903 --> 00:32:35,903
Loser. A fucking loser.

753
00:32:37,239 --> 00:32:38,906
- Maybe tonight's the night.
- What?

754
00:32:40,109 --> 00:32:43,343
A fucking loser. Maybe
tonight's the night.

755
00:32:43,345 --> 00:32:45,446
[Jason] What the
fuck is he saying?

756
00:32:45,448 --> 00:32:47,281
Maybe tonight's the night.

757
00:32:55,057 --> 00:32:56,457
Mom! You can't put
that on me, okay?

758
00:32:56,459 --> 00:32:58,225
I can't force him to call you.

759
00:32:58,227 --> 00:33:00,894
No, I'm not trying to start
anything with you, mom!

760
00:33:02,198 --> 00:33:03,764
Oh okay, so now you
don't want to talk to me?

761
00:33:03,766 --> 00:33:05,833
Okay, well fuck me then!

762
00:33:06,469 --> 00:33:08,802
You booked it!
Yeah, your first film.

763
00:33:08,804 --> 00:33:10,838
Now, it's a not a big
role, but it's a good one.

764
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:12,940
Good enough to get your face
out there. What did I say, huh?

765
00:33:12,942 --> 00:33:14,475
It's all starting. [laughs]

766
00:33:14,477 --> 00:33:16,376
See, Jason, this
is what happens

767
00:33:16,378 --> 00:33:18,345
when you listen to your mother.

768
00:33:19,448 --> 00:33:21,448
I'm not that bad,
am I? [chuckles]

769
00:33:21,450 --> 00:33:25,252
And you, you might be
the best manager ever!

770
00:33:25,254 --> 00:33:30,057
[laughs] Well, you
know, I do my best.

771
00:33:30,059 --> 00:33:32,526
Go ahead, have a seat right
over there. Thank you very much.

772
00:33:32,528 --> 00:33:36,497
Jason, what's wrong? I mean,
you don't seem so excited.

773
00:33:36,499 --> 00:33:39,166
Is the, uh, is the role
not big enough for you?

774
00:33:39,168 --> 00:33:40,868
No, it's not that.

775
00:33:40,870 --> 00:33:43,837
It, hey, is there anything
in the movie for Dylan?

776
00:33:43,839 --> 00:33:45,506
Nope. Not this time.

777
00:33:45,508 --> 00:33:47,374
But you're still looking
for stuff for him, right?

778
00:33:47,376 --> 00:33:49,443
Absolutely. Absolutely, Jen.

779
00:33:49,445 --> 00:33:50,994
Uh, you know what?

780
00:33:50,996 --> 00:33:52,546
How 'bout I take Dylan to
a ball game this weekend?

781
00:33:52,548 --> 00:33:53,947
Y'know, give us some
time to be alone.

782
00:33:53,949 --> 00:33:55,549
I can work with him
on some acting stuff.

783
00:33:55,551 --> 00:33:57,785
I think this would
be great for Dylan.

784
00:33:57,787 --> 00:33:59,853
- Hey, can I go too? Please?
- Oh!

785
00:33:59,855 --> 00:34:02,089
No, buddy, not this time.
Just me and Dylan, okay?

786
00:34:02,091 --> 00:34:05,058
I, I think we need some
bonding time. Okay?

787
00:34:05,060 --> 00:34:07,060
But I am gonna make it
up to you. All right?

788
00:34:07,062 --> 00:34:09,229
I promise. And you, mister, huh?

789
00:34:09,231 --> 00:34:12,266
You... [laughs] You got
a lot of work to do.

790
00:34:12,268 --> 00:34:13,550
Uh, Jen?

791
00:34:13,552 --> 00:34:14,835
I need to talk to you
about some contract stuff

792
00:34:14,837 --> 00:34:15,469
in the other room.

793
00:34:15,471 --> 00:34:16,837
Jason, just sit tight.

794
00:34:18,140 --> 00:34:19,940
- So, you know, I act too.
- You're an actress?

795
00:34:19,942 --> 00:34:21,408
- Mhm.
- Wow! I did not know that.

796
00:34:21,410 --> 00:34:23,076
[Mother] Yeah, well that's
actually why we moved out here.

797
00:34:23,078 --> 00:34:24,311
[Paulie] Oh, that makes sense.

798
00:34:24,313 --> 00:34:26,847
Do you have, huh,
a headshot? Resume?

799
00:34:26,849 --> 00:34:28,816
Mom, stop! Why
are you saying that?

800
00:34:28,818 --> 00:34:32,319
You know that's not true!
You know I love you, Mom.

801
00:34:33,489 --> 00:34:36,056
I would never do that
and neither would Jason.

802
00:34:37,459 --> 00:34:40,594
Mom, stop, Mom,
you're being crazy!

803
00:34:40,596 --> 00:34:43,597
You screwed up
again! Jesus Christ!

804
00:34:43,599 --> 00:34:46,867
I do everything for
you! Everything!

805
00:34:49,271 --> 00:34:53,407
I went over that audition
with you again and again!

806
00:34:54,844 --> 00:34:57,945
You were supposed to book this.

807
00:34:57,947 --> 00:35:01,315
How could you screw those
lines up? You had them, Jason!

808
00:35:01,317 --> 00:35:04,585
You had them! Get up!

809
00:35:04,587 --> 00:35:07,321
Get up! Get over to the mirror.

810
00:35:07,323 --> 00:35:10,290
Get over there. Look at you.

811
00:35:10,292 --> 00:35:12,993
Huh? Why can't you be cuter?

812
00:35:12,995 --> 00:35:15,863
Oh, cause you take
after your father!

813
00:35:16,999 --> 00:35:19,600
And now I'm the one
stuck with you, huh?

814
00:35:19,602 --> 00:35:22,002
Mediocre son with no talent!

815
00:35:22,905 --> 00:35:24,104
Get up!

816
00:35:24,106 --> 00:35:25,005
Get up!

817
00:35:26,308 --> 00:35:27,207
Sit down!

818
00:35:29,311 --> 00:35:30,210
Sit down!

819
00:35:31,447 --> 00:35:32,346
Dylan!

820
00:35:32,348 --> 00:35:37,985
Get in here! This diva doesn't
think he has to do any work.

821
00:35:40,990 --> 00:35:44,057
Oh, stop crying like
a little bitch, okay?

822
00:35:44,059 --> 00:35:47,594
Only little girls cry, and
you are not a little girl.

823
00:35:49,164 --> 00:35:50,964
You're not eating
dinner tonight, okay?

824
00:35:50,966 --> 00:35:53,233
Dylan and I are gonna go out,

825
00:35:53,235 --> 00:35:56,069
while you sit here
...look at me,

826
00:35:56,071 --> 00:35:58,639
and go over the
script Paulie sent.

827
00:35:58,641 --> 00:36:00,140
Okay?

828
00:36:00,142 --> 00:36:01,909
I don't care if you have
to stay up all night long,

829
00:36:01,911 --> 00:36:04,645
I want you off book
by the morning.

830
00:36:04,647 --> 00:36:05,646
Understand?

831
00:36:05,648 --> 00:36:10,217
All right, I love you. I
do, I love you, I love you.

832
00:36:10,219 --> 00:36:11,285
Okay.

833
00:36:11,287 --> 00:36:12,519
Dylan!

834
00:36:12,521 --> 00:36:14,454
Get in here! Dylan!

835
00:36:16,225 --> 00:36:19,126
Take it back.
Mom, take it back!

836
00:36:20,496 --> 00:36:21,995
No, I, I really can't listen
to this any more. Okay?

837
00:36:21,997 --> 00:36:24,031
So, I'm gonna hang up now. Mom!

838
00:36:24,033 --> 00:36:25,933
- I'm hanging up now
- Mom, this is Jason.

839
00:36:25,935 --> 00:36:27,434
If you call this
house one more time,

840
00:36:27,436 --> 00:36:30,037
I'm calling my lawyers, and
you know what that means.

841
00:36:30,039 --> 00:36:31,471
Dylan hang up the phone!

842
00:36:46,188 --> 00:36:48,655
Are you sure that I don't
look fat in this dress?

843
00:36:48,657 --> 00:36:50,157
I've barely been eating.

844
00:36:50,159 --> 00:36:51,391
God, you have nothing
to worry about. All right?

845
00:36:51,393 --> 00:36:53,961
Your body's perfect,
your hair is perfect,

846
00:36:53,963 --> 00:36:55,462
and now your nose is perfect.

847
00:36:56,732 --> 00:36:58,265
Do you really think so?

848
00:36:59,368 --> 00:37:01,468
Heather, you're so
hot, it's ridiculous.

849
00:37:01,470 --> 00:37:04,338
No, you're so hot [sniffs]
and you're so talented.

850
00:37:04,340 --> 00:37:06,707
And you, like, [sniffs] nail
every scene that we're in.

851
00:37:06,709 --> 00:37:09,042
I don't even know
how you manage to...

852
00:37:12,481 --> 00:37:14,014
- Um...
- Are you into this?

853
00:37:15,751 --> 00:37:17,718
I have a boyfriend.

854
00:37:17,720 --> 00:37:21,188
Okay. Well, same sex hook-ups
don't count as cheating.

855
00:37:22,358 --> 00:37:24,391
I've never been
with a girl before.

856
00:37:24,393 --> 00:37:27,027
[Alyssa] Well, no guy can
please a girl like a girl can.

857
00:37:27,029 --> 00:37:27,995
Sorry, boys.

858
00:37:27,997 --> 00:37:29,029
That's some bullshit.

859
00:37:30,632 --> 00:37:33,166
Oh, these are
perfect. I'm so jealous.

860
00:37:33,168 --> 00:37:35,302
Well, they cost
my father a fortune.

861
00:37:37,339 --> 00:37:39,272
Speaking of my father,

862
00:37:39,274 --> 00:37:42,009
I feel like you've been
avoiding him tonight.

863
00:37:42,011 --> 00:37:44,444
Just be honest, you're
not planning on re-signing

864
00:37:44,446 --> 00:37:46,046
on my show, are you?

865
00:37:47,216 --> 00:37:50,450
Don't lie to me.
Because I hate liars.

866
00:37:53,222 --> 00:37:56,056
I want to, but Celeste
thinks that I shouldn't.

867
00:37:57,726 --> 00:37:59,326
I know that my character
has helped boost the ratings

868
00:37:59,328 --> 00:38:01,128
back up, and I told
her that I didn't want

869
00:38:01,130 --> 00:38:02,429
to just abandon it.

870
00:38:03,432 --> 00:38:06,600
Hey. I've been
looking all over for...

871
00:38:06,602 --> 00:38:07,967
Are you doing coke?

872
00:38:07,969 --> 00:38:09,335
This is a really big
night for me, like,

873
00:38:09,338 --> 00:38:10,771
a really big night.

874
00:38:10,773 --> 00:38:12,672
I'm under a lot of pressure
and you just don't seem

875
00:38:12,674 --> 00:38:14,107
to get it.

876
00:38:14,109 --> 00:38:15,408
I mean, everyone
is looking at me,

877
00:38:15,410 --> 00:38:16,710
and you just keep embarrassing
me in front of Jason.

878
00:38:16,712 --> 00:38:18,512
I'm embarrassing you?

879
00:38:18,514 --> 00:38:20,964
Tell me the truth, are
you sleeping with him?

880
00:38:20,966 --> 00:38:23,417
Oh, my god! You can't even
support me for one night?

881
00:38:23,419 --> 00:38:25,619
I mean, I am doing
all of this for us.

882
00:38:25,621 --> 00:38:27,788
Do you not realize how big
this could be for my career,

883
00:38:27,790 --> 00:38:29,089
and for yours?

884
00:38:29,091 --> 00:38:30,123
- Bullshit!
- You're just jealous.

885
00:38:30,125 --> 00:38:32,159
Jealous of what?
Of these people?

886
00:38:32,161 --> 00:38:34,127
Of this life that that you
once thought was a bunch

887
00:38:34,129 --> 00:38:35,462
of bullshit too?

888
00:38:35,464 --> 00:38:38,131
This is what you're
working so hard for?

889
00:38:38,133 --> 00:38:40,700
You wanna be like her? Another
coked out, mediocre actress?

890
00:38:40,702 --> 00:38:42,135
Alyssa doesn't have
to work for anything.

891
00:38:42,137 --> 00:38:43,470
She's got daddy's
money to fall back on.

892
00:38:43,472 --> 00:38:45,372
- You need to go home!
- No!

893
00:38:45,374 --> 00:38:47,107
If this Jason Mast
movie is so important

894
00:38:47,109 --> 00:38:49,176
and the only way you can
get the part is to fuck him,

895
00:38:49,178 --> 00:38:50,277
then fuck him!

896
00:38:51,814 --> 00:38:52,712
Go home.

897
00:38:58,821 --> 00:39:02,756
No. We're leaving
together, or we're done.

898
00:39:17,873 --> 00:39:19,773
Well it looks
like you're done.

899
00:39:26,882 --> 00:39:28,381
Are you gonna go save him now?

900
00:39:39,895 --> 00:39:41,194
Here.

901
00:39:42,364 --> 00:39:43,730
This will make it better.

902
00:39:52,207 --> 00:39:53,306
[soft music]

903
00:40:00,182 --> 00:40:01,481
You got balls, man.

904
00:40:02,618 --> 00:40:04,584
I don't think anyone's
ever said anything like

905
00:40:04,586 --> 00:40:05,886
that to Alyssa.

906
00:40:07,222 --> 00:40:09,489
At least not to her
face. You all right?

907
00:40:09,491 --> 00:40:11,391
Yeah, I'm cool.

908
00:40:11,393 --> 00:40:13,426
You want a cigarette?

909
00:40:13,428 --> 00:40:14,327
I quit.

910
00:40:15,297 --> 00:40:17,197
You want a cigarette?

911
00:40:17,199 --> 00:40:19,466
Yeah.
[knocking]

912
00:40:23,505 --> 00:40:25,505
You cannot come in here.

913
00:40:25,507 --> 00:40:27,374
But I thought you liked me.

914
00:40:28,477 --> 00:40:31,611
Look, kid, you're
hot as fuck. Okay?

915
00:40:31,613 --> 00:40:33,847
And when you're 18, if
I'm still alive, call me.

916
00:40:33,849 --> 00:40:35,815
Okay, first off, don't
call me kid. I hate that.

917
00:40:35,817 --> 00:40:37,450
It's condescending.

918
00:40:37,452 --> 00:40:39,186
Okay. I'm sorry, I
didn't mean to offend you-

919
00:40:39,188 --> 00:40:40,921
- And second off, you're
a kid, your room's a mess.

920
00:40:40,923 --> 00:40:42,556
You're a total slob.

921
00:40:42,558 --> 00:40:44,925
Okay, you're a sassy
little thing, aren't ya?

922
00:40:44,927 --> 00:40:46,259
Do you have a cigarette?

923
00:40:46,261 --> 00:40:48,395
That I can do.
But not in here.

924
00:40:48,397 --> 00:40:51,331
Outside, where
everyone can see us.

925
00:40:52,267 --> 00:40:55,202
No. We're not ready
to announce it yet.

926
00:40:56,405 --> 00:40:58,805
But if everything goes the
way it's supposed to...

927
00:40:58,807 --> 00:41:00,707
No, no, no don't worry.

928
00:41:00,709 --> 00:41:02,943
I know how to handle Jack Rossi.

929
00:41:03,979 --> 00:41:06,513
I don't know, man,
something about her's changed.

930
00:41:07,683 --> 00:41:09,416
It could be the new nose.

931
00:41:09,418 --> 00:41:11,284
I don't think
it's the new nose.

932
00:41:11,286 --> 00:41:13,920
It might be, but
that's not what I mean.

933
00:41:17,259 --> 00:41:20,460
Seriously, dude? Heather's
just doing what she has to do.

934
00:41:20,462 --> 00:41:21,795
Look, she wants to
be in his movie.

935
00:41:21,797 --> 00:41:23,930
It's a great part, it's
great for her career,

936
00:41:23,932 --> 00:41:26,600
and Jason has no
interest in Heather.

937
00:41:26,602 --> 00:41:28,235
Trust me.

938
00:41:28,237 --> 00:41:31,338
And even if they did fuck,
it doesn't mean anything.

939
00:41:31,340 --> 00:41:33,240
What are you taking about?
That would change everything.

940
00:41:33,242 --> 00:41:36,309
Why? She loves you, dude.

941
00:41:38,413 --> 00:41:42,349
It'll all work out.
You smoke pot?

942
00:41:43,919 --> 00:41:46,253
Uh, not any more.
It makes me paranoid.

943
00:41:47,322 --> 00:41:49,689
Well, tonight you do. Come on.

944
00:41:49,691 --> 00:41:52,892
No, I mean it, Alyssa.
I, I really do love him.

945
00:41:52,894 --> 00:41:55,428
I mean, look at you and
Ryan. You know how it is.

946
00:41:55,430 --> 00:41:56,763
I'm not in love with Ryan.

947
00:41:56,765 --> 00:41:58,614
Yes, you are.

948
00:41:58,616 --> 00:42:00,466
No, I'm not. That's not what
our relationship is about.

949
00:42:00,469 --> 00:42:01,668
Okay.

950
00:42:01,670 --> 00:42:02,902
Well, I don't know that
much about you two,

951
00:42:02,904 --> 00:42:05,772
but I see it every time
that you're with him.

952
00:42:05,774 --> 00:42:07,040
It's all over your face.

953
00:42:07,042 --> 00:42:08,408
You're kidding me?

954
00:42:08,410 --> 00:42:09,609
You've been with Heather
since you were 15

955
00:42:09,611 --> 00:42:11,411
and she's the only
one you've been with?

956
00:42:11,413 --> 00:42:12,312
Yeah.

957
00:42:13,649 --> 00:42:15,749
Then how do you even know
you're in love with her?

958
00:42:17,286 --> 00:42:20,387
I don't know any
more. What about you?

959
00:42:20,389 --> 00:42:22,422
Are you in love with Alyssa?

960
00:42:22,424 --> 00:42:23,757
Uh, she's one of
my best friends,

961
00:42:23,759 --> 00:42:26,493
and we fuck from time to time...

962
00:42:27,596 --> 00:42:28,962
But no, I'm not
in love with her.

963
00:42:33,502 --> 00:42:36,002
That whole thing about us
being a couple is just a cover.

964
00:42:36,004 --> 00:42:38,638
[coughs] Cover for what?

965
00:42:39,741 --> 00:42:41,041
[Heather] But you and
Ryan have sex, right?

966
00:42:41,043 --> 00:42:42,442
Yeah, all the
time. But, so what?

967
00:42:42,444 --> 00:42:44,511
We have sex with
a lot of people.

968
00:42:44,513 --> 00:42:46,346
- Guys and girls?
- Yeah.

969
00:42:47,649 --> 00:42:49,683
Ryan Logan has sex with dudes?

970
00:42:49,685 --> 00:42:50,717
Sometimes.

971
00:42:51,753 --> 00:42:53,086
Well then, he's gay.

972
00:42:53,088 --> 00:42:54,487
No, he's not gay.

973
00:42:54,489 --> 00:42:55,889
No gay man could do
what Ryan does to me.

974
00:42:55,891 --> 00:42:58,425
Besides, I hook up with
girls, and I'm not a lesbian.

975
00:42:58,427 --> 00:43:00,060
Yeah, well it's
different for girls.

976
00:43:00,062 --> 00:43:01,728
No, it's not.

977
00:43:01,730 --> 00:43:03,029
Everyone is bisexual,
girls are just man enough

978
00:43:03,031 --> 00:43:05,047
to admit it.

979
00:43:05,049 --> 00:43:07,066
You're not getting it dude.
It's not about the fucking.

980
00:43:07,069 --> 00:43:08,968
I mean, you can fuck
night after night,

981
00:43:08,970 --> 00:43:11,604
and it can mean nothing.

982
00:43:11,606 --> 00:43:14,341
It's all about the connection
between two souls, you know?

983
00:43:15,510 --> 00:43:16,843
What are you talking about?

984
00:43:18,113 --> 00:43:21,881
Okay. I think we're
all just souls, man.

985
00:43:23,418 --> 00:43:27,087
I believe a real connection
can be with a male or a female.

986
00:43:27,089 --> 00:43:28,388
It's about getting
to that deeper level

987
00:43:28,390 --> 00:43:29,756
where we're all just the same.

988
00:43:29,758 --> 00:43:33,360
You know? No sexuality,
no religion, no judgment.

989
00:43:34,696 --> 00:43:37,097
Even if you just hook
up for one night.

990
00:43:37,099 --> 00:43:39,833
All right, if you're just
there with the other person,

991
00:43:39,835 --> 00:43:43,136
looking into their eyes,
and touching them, y'know?

992
00:43:44,439 --> 00:43:45,405
Soul to soul?

993
00:43:47,109 --> 00:43:48,608
To me, that's love.

994
00:43:50,779 --> 00:43:52,912
You gotta meet
Ryan. He's the best.

995
00:43:52,914 --> 00:43:54,013
I love that guy.

996
00:43:54,015 --> 00:43:55,382
Yeah, I can tell.

997
00:43:56,585 --> 00:43:57,684
What does that mean?

998
00:43:59,121 --> 00:44:01,404
I don't know.

999
00:44:01,406 --> 00:44:03,690
It's just I saw you hitting
his ass earlier, you two were,

1000
00:44:03,692 --> 00:44:05,558
like, all over each other.

1001
00:44:06,962 --> 00:44:10,764
Seems pretty weird to me. No
guys in Idaho act like that.

1002
00:44:10,766 --> 00:44:13,400
Okay, well this ain't Idaho.

1003
00:44:13,402 --> 00:44:15,502
Well, I know that.

1004
00:44:15,504 --> 00:44:20,106
There's just something
different with all you guys.

1005
00:44:22,043 --> 00:44:25,412
We've been through a lot
of shit together. Okay?

1006
00:44:25,414 --> 00:44:27,147
Shit you wouldn't even believe.

1007
00:44:27,149 --> 00:44:29,082
I guess. But I do not
know how you do that.

1008
00:44:29,084 --> 00:44:32,051
I could never be with someone
who didn't want just me.

1009
00:44:32,053 --> 00:44:33,620
Look, what you have with
Brody might work for you,

1010
00:44:33,622 --> 00:44:35,054
but I don't need to be
tied down like that.

1011
00:44:35,056 --> 00:44:36,923
I can sleep with
whoever I want to, too.

1012
00:44:38,460 --> 00:44:39,626
Say whatever you want,

1013
00:44:39,628 --> 00:44:41,761
but I still think
you're in love with him.

1014
00:44:41,763 --> 00:44:43,763
Get real, Alyssa.

1015
00:44:43,765 --> 00:44:46,466
Oh, you want to get
real? Let's get real.

1016
00:44:46,468 --> 00:44:47,950
I don't believe you.

1017
00:44:47,952 --> 00:44:49,435
You've never had a
connection with a guy?

1018
00:44:49,438 --> 00:44:51,538
No! Why would I lie?

1019
00:44:51,540 --> 00:44:52,539
I have nothing to hide?

1020
00:44:52,541 --> 00:44:54,007
God, that must be nice.

1021
00:44:54,009 --> 00:44:55,508
Mm. What?

1022
00:44:55,510 --> 00:44:56,709
Not having anything to hide.

1023
00:44:56,711 --> 00:44:58,611
I feel like I'm always hiding.

1024
00:44:58,613 --> 00:45:00,747
Man, fuck what everybody says.

1025
00:45:00,749 --> 00:45:04,017
So what, if you're like,
attracted to souls, or whatever.

1026
00:45:05,053 --> 00:45:07,520
Oh, man. I like you, Brody.

1027
00:45:07,522 --> 00:45:09,456
You're a good dude.
You're different.

1028
00:45:10,125 --> 00:45:11,524
Different from what?

1029
00:45:13,462 --> 00:45:15,094
Different from
everyone in my life.

1030
00:45:19,801 --> 00:45:21,701
Answer the fucking
question, Heather!

1031
00:45:23,505 --> 00:45:24,504
You think I'm an idiot?

1032
00:45:25,774 --> 00:45:27,507
You fuck Jason, and he
puts you in his movie,

1033
00:45:27,509 --> 00:45:28,808
and then you don't need my show.

1034
00:45:28,810 --> 00:45:29,709
Right?

1035
00:45:31,580 --> 00:45:35,114
Right. Because you have
no fucking loyalty.

1036
00:45:38,220 --> 00:45:39,919
Well, what would you do?

1037
00:45:41,590 --> 00:45:44,691
I wouldn't have that
problem. Because I was born in.

1038
00:45:45,694 --> 00:45:47,227
You have to fuck your way in.

1039
00:45:51,766 --> 00:45:53,233
What the hell just
happened in here?

1040
00:45:53,235 --> 00:45:54,934
You know she could
blow this whole thing.

1041
00:45:54,936 --> 00:45:56,903
You go after her and fix it
before she talks to her father.

1042
00:45:56,905 --> 00:45:58,004
Let's go.

1043
00:45:58,006 --> 00:45:59,338
So, what?

1044
00:45:59,340 --> 00:46:00,673
You just believe everything
you read and you thought

1045
00:46:00,675 --> 00:46:02,208
I was gonna be
some asshole, huh?

1046
00:46:02,210 --> 00:46:05,612
No, no, not an asshole.
Just not this normal guy.

1047
00:46:06,281 --> 00:46:07,914
Well I mean, I guess
you're not that normal,

1048
00:46:07,916 --> 00:46:10,617
you've been famous since
you were a teenager.

1049
00:46:10,619 --> 00:46:12,952
God, that must have been a
nightmare for your parents.

1050
00:46:14,256 --> 00:46:16,589
Actually, I was emancipated
from them when I was 16.

1051
00:46:17,692 --> 00:46:19,859
It's their choice by the way.

1052
00:46:19,861 --> 00:46:21,261
Y'know that way I could
work longer hours and make

1053
00:46:21,263 --> 00:46:23,162
a lot of people
a lot more money.

1054
00:46:25,667 --> 00:46:27,033
That's pretty shitty.

1055
00:46:28,970 --> 00:46:30,603
I can't imagine
growing up that way.

1056
00:46:31,706 --> 00:46:33,873
But, but I guess none of
that matters now, now you can

1057
00:46:33,875 --> 00:46:35,642
have whatever you want, huh?

1058
00:46:36,878 --> 00:46:40,580
Why? Because I
have a lot of money?

1059
00:46:41,950 --> 00:46:43,283
Money can't get you
everything you want.

1060
00:46:43,285 --> 00:46:44,551
That's not what I meant.

1061
00:46:44,553 --> 00:46:46,019
Yes, it is.

1062
00:46:46,021 --> 00:46:48,755
You, god, you look at me
and you think I have it all.

1063
00:46:48,757 --> 00:46:50,590
Y'know, but everything
that I do gets blasted

1064
00:46:50,592 --> 00:46:52,158
out to the world
for everyone to see.

1065
00:46:52,160 --> 00:46:54,060
You have no idea
what that's like.

1066
00:46:55,597 --> 00:46:57,597
People thinking they know
everything about you.

1067
00:46:58,700 --> 00:47:00,033
Really they know nothing at all.

1068
00:47:00,035 --> 00:47:02,602
[soft music]
[water splashing]

1069
00:47:14,683 --> 00:47:19,218
[laughs] Hey, boys, come on.
No running around the pool!

1070
00:47:19,220 --> 00:47:20,720
What'd I say?

1071
00:47:20,722 --> 00:47:21,888
I'll come over there and
snap you right in the ass,

1072
00:47:21,890 --> 00:47:23,323
you little fuckers. [laughs]

1073
00:47:24,593 --> 00:47:26,926
So, you going in,
huh? It's pretty warm.

1074
00:47:27,896 --> 00:47:29,929
- I, I'm not sure.
- Yeah?

1075
00:47:29,931 --> 00:47:31,664
Well, I'm glad I convinced
your mother to let

1076
00:47:31,666 --> 00:47:32,865
you stay here tonight.

1077
00:47:34,002 --> 00:47:35,668
Me too.

1078
00:47:35,670 --> 00:47:38,171
You know, Jason, I think
you... I think you...

1079
00:47:38,173 --> 00:47:40,873
[laughs] You are
gonna be a big star.

1080
00:47:43,111 --> 00:47:45,712
- You really think so?
- Oh yeah. Oh yeah.

1081
00:47:45,714 --> 00:47:48,982
You're better than all these
little shits. Except for one.

1082
00:47:48,984 --> 00:47:52,919
Huh? Now, you see
that boy right there?

1083
00:47:52,921 --> 00:47:56,089
That is Ryan Logan.
You heard of him?

1084
00:47:57,726 --> 00:48:00,627
Yeah, of course.
He's got that TV show.

1085
00:48:00,629 --> 00:48:01,994
He's amazing.

1086
00:48:01,996 --> 00:48:03,362
That's right. He's
got a great career.

1087
00:48:03,365 --> 00:48:06,833
And I got the same
plans for you. Huh, huh?

1088
00:48:07,702 --> 00:48:09,802
[both laugh]

1089
00:48:13,341 --> 00:48:15,141
[Paulie] What happened?
Where's your sock, huh?

1090
00:48:15,143 --> 00:48:17,243
Didn't I tell you to always
wear a sock in there?

1091
00:48:17,245 --> 00:48:18,978
[Jason] I'm, I'm
sorry, Paulie. I forgot.

1092
00:48:27,155 --> 00:48:29,722
- Better?
- Oh yeah. See?

1093
00:48:29,724 --> 00:48:31,691
Much better. Much better.

1094
00:48:33,061 --> 00:48:35,695
You're still a sexy son of
a bitch, though, either way.

1095
00:48:35,697 --> 00:48:39,065
All right? So you are gonna
sleep in my wing tonight.

1096
00:48:39,067 --> 00:48:42,168
Yeah. Ryan's gonna be there too.

1097
00:48:42,170 --> 00:48:44,003
And Dylan, if he behaves!

1098
00:48:45,106 --> 00:48:47,240
[Caley] So, you just
didn't like acting?

1099
00:48:47,242 --> 00:48:49,709
No. I did like acting.

1100
00:48:49,711 --> 00:48:50,877
I loved it, actually.

1101
00:48:52,080 --> 00:48:53,780
But there were
just certain things

1102
00:48:53,782 --> 00:48:56,449
that they wanted me to do
that I just couldn't do.

1103
00:48:56,451 --> 00:48:58,384
Y'know, maybe I should've,

1104
00:48:58,386 --> 00:49:00,119
maybe things would
be a lot different.

1105
00:49:01,423 --> 00:49:03,823
There was just some stuff

1106
00:49:05,193 --> 00:49:07,026
that I wasn't willing to do.

1107
00:49:07,028 --> 00:49:08,461
Like what?

1108
00:49:08,463 --> 00:49:10,897
Hey Dylan, come
on now! All right?

1109
00:49:10,899 --> 00:49:12,965
Slow down! Be careful!

1110
00:49:12,967 --> 00:49:15,468
I don't want any of you
boys drowning on my watch!

1111
00:49:16,771 --> 00:49:19,706
Jason, come on,
man. You seem shy.

1112
00:49:19,708 --> 00:49:22,975
All right? Come on, let's
get the fun started, huh?

1113
00:49:22,977 --> 00:49:25,044
We gotta get you
out of your shell,

1114
00:49:25,046 --> 00:49:26,879
and get you in that pool.

1115
00:49:27,749 --> 00:49:29,215
- Okay.
- All right, good.

1116
00:49:29,217 --> 00:49:30,950
Now there, there's some
pool rules here after dark.

1117
00:49:30,952 --> 00:49:33,853
All right? Number one, you
always stick with a buddy.

1118
00:49:33,855 --> 00:49:35,088
Okay.

1119
00:49:35,090 --> 00:49:36,255
Number two, no
peeing in my pool.

1120
00:49:36,257 --> 00:49:37,724
[laughs] Okay.

1121
00:49:37,726 --> 00:49:40,226
And number three,
no suits after dark.

1122
00:49:41,496 --> 00:49:43,229
- Um, what?
- All right?

1123
00:49:43,231 --> 00:49:47,166
It just helps you to become a
better actor, more vulnerable.

1124
00:49:47,168 --> 00:49:49,902
Trust me. Take that.

1125
00:49:49,904 --> 00:49:51,804
Call your mother, tell
her you're gonna stay here

1126
00:49:51,806 --> 00:49:52,739
for the weekend.

1127
00:49:58,346 --> 00:50:00,780
[rhythmic music]

1128
00:50:21,803 --> 00:50:23,436
I'm still a virgin, Ryan.

1129
00:50:23,438 --> 00:50:27,507
I haven't even gotten my dick
sucked yet! Fuck you dude.

1130
00:50:27,509 --> 00:50:28,975
Yeah, yeah, I'm
still at Paulie's.

1131
00:50:28,977 --> 00:50:30,209
I'm staying here for a week.

1132
00:50:30,211 --> 00:50:32,311
I got auditions and
stuff to work on.

1133
00:50:35,817 --> 00:50:38,351
No, um,... it's just me.

1134
00:50:39,320 --> 00:50:41,120
Uh, Dylan left last night.

1135
00:50:45,794 --> 00:50:47,326
What are you talking about?

1136
00:50:49,297 --> 00:50:52,398
Well, I just got an
amazing call about you.

1137
00:50:53,468 --> 00:50:56,502
Yeah, I think this
could be your big break.

1138
00:50:56,504 --> 00:51:00,807
Now, it's a film called
the "Boys of Summer"

1139
00:51:00,809 --> 00:51:04,477
and it's produced by Jack Rossi.

1140
00:51:04,479 --> 00:51:05,878
Yeah, we got a meeting
in the morning,

1141
00:51:05,880 --> 00:51:07,246
Jack wants to meet you.

1142
00:51:07,248 --> 00:51:09,315
- Really?
- Yep.

1143
00:51:09,317 --> 00:51:11,083
- That's huge.
- [laughs] Yeah.

1144
00:51:12,453 --> 00:51:14,821
Y'know your mother, she's very
excited about this meeting.

1145
00:51:14,823 --> 00:51:16,289
Y'know she's very proud of you.

1146
00:51:16,291 --> 00:51:17,924
So she thinks it's best
that you stay here tonight

1147
00:51:17,926 --> 00:51:19,559
since you gotta be up so early.

1148
00:51:21,196 --> 00:51:22,061
Okay.

1149
00:51:22,063 --> 00:51:24,931
Y'know Jason, this
is a major game changer

1150
00:51:24,933 --> 00:51:26,199
for you and your family.

1151
00:51:28,603 --> 00:51:29,836
You seem nervous.

1152
00:51:34,943 --> 00:51:37,076
Am I ready for this?

1153
00:51:37,078 --> 00:51:39,212
[chuckles] Come on.
Let me help you relax.

1154
00:51:39,214 --> 00:51:41,047
All right? Come here.

1155
00:51:43,885 --> 00:51:44,984
You trust me?

1156
00:51:45,854 --> 00:51:46,919
Yeah.

1157
00:51:49,524 --> 00:51:52,925
There you go. [laughs] Yeah.

1158
00:51:55,096 --> 00:51:57,363
You know, we're
pretty close, right?

1159
00:51:57,365 --> 00:51:59,966
I mean other than being your
manager, we're buddies, right?

1160
00:52:01,135 --> 00:52:02,401
Of course, Paulie. You're,
like, one of my best friends.

1161
00:52:02,403 --> 00:52:04,871
Good. I'm glad
you feel that way.

1162
00:52:04,873 --> 00:52:08,975
Y'know, because trust
is very important

1163
00:52:08,977 --> 00:52:10,643
between a manager
and his client.

1164
00:52:11,512 --> 00:52:12,511
Okay? Yeah.

1165
00:52:15,383 --> 00:52:16,282
Yeah.

1166
00:52:18,586 --> 00:52:23,656
I mean, I've worked my ass
off for you, and tomorrow?

1167
00:52:24,993 --> 00:52:26,459
Whoo, tomorrow's gonna be
the biggest day of your life,

1168
00:52:26,461 --> 00:52:28,027
so far, all right?

1169
00:52:30,164 --> 00:52:33,900
I can't tell you how many boys
would want this opportunity,

1170
00:52:33,902 --> 00:52:37,270
to meet Jack Rossi and
make all their dreams

1171
00:52:37,272 --> 00:52:38,604
come true, huh?

1172
00:52:42,076 --> 00:52:44,043
Your buddy Ryan...

1173
00:52:44,045 --> 00:52:47,647
Your buddy Ryan's already
met Jack, and Ryan knows

1174
00:52:47,649 --> 00:52:50,016
how to make a deal happen.

1175
00:52:53,955 --> 00:52:57,189
Now, we were young and
we had all this money

1176
00:52:57,191 --> 00:52:58,157
just thrown at us.

1177
00:52:58,159 --> 00:53:00,059
I know that sounds really great,

1178
00:53:03,965 --> 00:53:05,364
but everything has a price.

1179
00:53:07,268 --> 00:53:08,167
Meaning?

1180
00:53:12,206 --> 00:53:13,105
You okay?

1181
00:53:18,479 --> 00:53:20,379
Yeah, man. I'm fine.

1182
00:53:22,350 --> 00:53:24,083
Let's go get a drink.

1183
00:53:26,054 --> 00:53:27,286
[Celeste] Jason!

1184
00:53:27,288 --> 00:53:29,455
Jack's leaving soon,
he's looking for you.

1185
00:53:29,457 --> 00:53:32,992
I'll bring him back here.
[tense music]

1186
00:53:36,497 --> 00:53:39,065
We have to bring
them down, Ryan! No!

1187
00:53:39,067 --> 00:53:40,499
No, I don't care what
kind of power he has!

1188
00:53:40,501 --> 00:53:42,001
No! It's not right.

1189
00:53:42,003 --> 00:53:42,735
You were shaking
the other night,

1190
00:53:42,737 --> 00:53:44,303
and Dylan couldn't even walk.

1191
00:53:44,305 --> 00:53:47,139
Fuck Jack Rossi, man!
[knocking]

1192
00:53:47,141 --> 00:53:49,642
Okay, I'll be
right out. Hold on!

1193
00:53:49,644 --> 00:53:51,110
[Jack] It's Jack.

1194
00:54:01,089 --> 00:54:04,023
[heart beating]

1195
00:54:07,195 --> 00:54:09,228
There's the man of the hour.

1196
00:54:11,199 --> 00:54:13,432
Come on, bring it in, man.

1197
00:54:14,469 --> 00:54:16,602
See, I deserve a
bigger hug than that.

1198
00:54:18,072 --> 00:54:21,007
Congrats on that nomination.
You earned it, huh?

1199
00:54:22,310 --> 00:54:25,111
Come on, man, make me a drink.
We got a lot to discuss.

1200
00:54:30,051 --> 00:54:31,083
You know what I like.

00:54:31,085 --> 00:54:32,118

high about now.

1203
00:54:37,759 --> 00:54:40,793
[laughs] Personally, I
thought the film sucked,

1204
00:54:42,096 --> 00:54:45,131
but your performance
was solid, as usual.

1205
00:54:45,133 --> 00:54:46,065
I told you.

1206
00:54:46,067 --> 00:54:49,135
Told you the day you
walked into my office,

1207
00:54:49,137 --> 00:54:50,503

Find Heather. I want
to talk to you both.

Thank you for what?

1220
00:55:27,408 --> 00:55:30,142
For financing your
movie. Come on, Jason.

1221

00:55:43,424 --> 00:55:44,690
You wanted to see Heather?

1225
00:55:44,692 --> 00:55:46,559
Well, don't you look gorgeous.

1226
00:55:46,561 --> 00:55:49,228
- Hello, Mr. Rossi.
- Oh, Mr. Rossi?

I think you'll be calling
me Jack again before long.

I've been doing all night?

00:55:55,603 --> 00:55:58,204
Some people work, Alyssa.

1231
00:55:58,206 --> 00:56:01,140
I've had business to take
care of all over this place.

1232

What are you eating?

1233
00:56:02,877 --> 00:56:05,277
There's no carbs
in this, Daddy.

1234
00:56:05,279 --> 00:56:07,413
Do you see Heather
eating that junk?

1235
00:56:07,415 --> 00:56:10,216
By the way, Heather,
you look stunning.

Well, it is nice to meet
you, Carly. [chuckles]

about my birthday next week.

You know I gave him
his big break, right?

1254
00:56:58,199 --> 00:57:00,599
A little film called,
"Boys of Summer".

1255
00:57:00,601 --> 00:57:03,169

Nice to finally meet you.

1262
00:57:29,931 --> 00:57:33,199
Paulie's been talking
about you for months.

1263
00:57:33,201 --> 00:57:36,669
He speaks highly of you, and
he knows how to spot talent.

That's nice of him.

You want a drink? I
won't tell your mother.

Oh, I, I tried it before.
I don't like the taste.

[Jack] Be a man,
Jason, and have a drink.

1270
00:57:51,018 --> 00:57:52,718
Your buddy Ryan drinks
with me, and he's 16.

1271
00:57:53,821 --> 00:57:55,321
Yeah. Go ahead.

1272
00:58:02,563 --> 00:58:04,730
I can take it
from here, Paulie.

1273
00:58:08,736 --> 00:58:11,937
Whatever you say,
Jack. [laughs] Yeah.

1274
00:58:15,309 --> 00:58:16,308
Yeah, yeah.

1275
00:58:18,479 --> 00:58:20,512
We're gonna do
a little improv.

1276
00:58:22,016 --> 00:58:25,451
I'll be the love interest
and I'm in danger.

1277
00:58:25,453 --> 00:58:27,920
And you're the hero. You ready?

1278
00:58:28,789 --> 00:58:30,990
- Yeah.
- Yeah? Action!

1279
00:58:30,992 --> 00:58:33,626
Help me! Help me,
please help me!

1280
00:58:35,930 --> 00:58:36,795
I'm here. What's going on?

1281
00:58:36,797 --> 00:58:37,997
Are you okay?

1282
00:58:37,999 --> 00:58:39,832
No, my arm! There's
blood everywhere.

1283
00:58:39,834 --> 00:58:41,367
He tried to kill me!

1284
00:58:42,837 --> 00:58:44,369
Well, what are
you just gonna do?

1285
00:58:44,371 --> 00:58:45,904
Just stand there? The
love of you life is dying.

1286

Do something, for Christ's sake.

1287
00:58:47,608 --> 00:58:49,908
Take your shirt off,
wrap it around my wound.

1288
00:58:54,849 --> 00:58:56,048
Okay, okay, not bad.

1289
00:58:57,885 --> 00:58:58,784
Not bad.

1290
00:59:02,056 --> 00:59:05,291
We gotta do a little work
on the arms and the abs.

1291
00:59:05,926 --> 00:59:07,326
I'll get you a trainer.

1292
00:59:09,630 --> 00:59:10,763
That'd be awesome.

1293
00:59:12,366 --> 00:59:14,633
See, as far as the acting,
though? You're holding back.

1294
00:59:15,936 --> 00:59:17,835
Look, you wanna
be a leading man,

1295
00:59:17,837 --> 00:59:19,737
you gotta be comfortable
with yourself as a man,

1296
00:59:19,740 --> 00:59:21,974
you're not a little
boy any more.

1297
00:59:21,976 --> 00:59:25,010
You gotta be naked in
front that audience, son.

1298
00:59:25,012 --> 00:59:26,578

we're working with.

00:59:32,753 --> 00:59:33,652
What?

1302
00:59:35,990 --> 00:59:37,056
Come here.

1303
00:59:42,730 --> 00:59:43,629
Closer.

1304
00:59:47,635 --> 00:59:49,735
Nah, you're still
holding back, Jason.

1305
00:59:51,072 --> 00:59:52,104
I mean, don't you want your
career to take off like

1306
00:59:52,106 --> 00:59:53,572
your buddy Ryan's?

1307
00:59:54,775 --> 00:59:56,442
Yeah?

1308
00:59:56,444 --> 01:00:00,446
Then be a big man and take
off the pants, and the boxers.

1309

1310
01:00:12,626 --> 01:00:13,926
- Isn't that right, Jason?
- What?

1311
01:00:13,928 --> 01:00:15,477
Hey Daddy, how
long are you staying,

1312
01:00:15,479 --> 01:00:17,029
because I think the three
of us need to have a talk.

1313
01:00:17,031 --> 01:00:18,397
About an hour.

1314
01:00:18,399 --> 01:00:19,365
I'm leaving for
Italy in the morning,

1315
01:00:19,367 --> 01:00:20,866
I haven't packed a thing.

1316
01:00:20,868 --> 01:00:22,401
Well, how long are you going?

1317
01:00:22,403 --> 01:00:23,551
A few weeks.

1318
01:00:23,553 --> 01:00:24,702
But, Daddy, my
birthday's next week.

1319
01:00:24,705 --> 01:00:26,472
And you promised that
we would go together.

1320
01:00:26,474 --> 01:00:28,423
Well, throw any party
you want, sweetheart.

1321
01:00:28,425 --> 01:00:30,375
Just send the bill to Maria.
I'll cover the whole thing.

1322
01:00:30,378 --> 01:00:32,144
No, forget it.
I'll just call Mom.

1323
01:00:32,146 --> 01:00:35,147
Like your mother's gonna do
something for your birthday.

1324
01:00:35,149 --> 01:00:37,383
You'll be lucky if she
remembers to call you.

1325
01:00:37,385 --> 01:00:38,851
Don't worry, we already
have something planned

1326
01:00:38,853 --> 01:00:40,119
for your birthday.

1327
01:00:40,121 --> 01:00:40,953
Daddy, please, just
talk to me for a second-

1328
01:00:40,955 --> 01:00:41,920
- That's enough!

1329
01:00:43,491 --> 01:00:46,425
You're embarrassing yourself.
This conversation is over.

1330
01:00:46,427 --> 01:00:48,093
I will deal with you later.

1331
01:00:53,167 --> 01:00:55,134
Hey. Hey, are you okay?

1332
01:00:59,573 --> 01:01:01,173
How's my new star?

1333
01:01:01,175 --> 01:01:03,876
- Hi, Mr. Rossi.
- You can call me Jack.

1334
01:01:05,713 --> 01:01:08,080
- I'm upset with you.
- Why?

1335
01:01:09,417 --> 01:01:11,550
Because you haven't
been in to see me yet.

1336
01:01:12,920 --> 01:01:14,702
[Caley] I'm sorry.

1337
01:01:14,704 --> 01:01:16,487
Celeste never told me
anything about a meeting.

1338
01:01:16,490 --> 01:01:19,658
Well, we didn't have one,
but we could have one now.

1339
01:01:21,195 --> 01:01:23,796
I got some projects I think
you could be right for.

1340

You're not leaving
yet, are you Carly?

1341
01:01:28,436 --> 01:01:31,937
It's Caley. Actually,
my mom's here.

1342
01:01:31,939 --> 01:01:33,605
We're supposed to go home soon.

1343
01:01:33,607 --> 01:01:36,742
No, no, no, no, no. I'll
get a car for your mom.

go somewhere and chat.

No! How could you
let him in this house?

him do it to her!

01:02:43,277 --> 01:02:46,044
No, don't worry about
a thing, Jack. Trust me.

1368
01:02:47,615 --> 01:02:49,581
I don't believe a word that
comes out of that kid's mouth.

1369
01:02:52,686 --> 01:02:54,152
Get your ass over here.

1370
01:02:55,022 --> 01:02:56,771
Dylan lies about everything,

1371
01:02:56,773 --> 01:02:58,523
so I don't blame you for not
wanting to work with him.

1372
01:02:58,526 --> 01:02:59,825
I will handle Jason.

1373
01:02:59,827 --> 01:03:02,261
I'm sure he's just going
along with his brother.

1374
01:03:03,831 --> 01:03:07,599
You have a zit! You need to
stay off the crafty, fatty.

1375
01:03:08,269 --> 01:03:10,869
Great. Well, I am so
glad we cleared this up.

1376
01:03:12,006 --> 01:03:14,540
In fact, you can just go
through me from now on.

1377
01:03:15,843 --> 01:03:17,976
I think it's time we
both move on from Paulie.

1378
01:03:20,915 --> 01:03:22,214
Mm-hm, exactly.

1379
01:03:23,317 --> 01:03:25,751
I'll be taking over
as Jason's manager.

1380
01:03:28,956 --> 01:03:30,556
Sounds good!

1381
01:03:30,558 --> 01:03:31,256
Take care.

1382
01:03:33,594 --> 01:03:35,160
Jack's sending you a car.

1383
01:03:36,297 --> 01:03:37,563
You two have a meeting.

1384
01:03:42,303 --> 01:03:43,551
I don't want to go.

1385
01:03:43,553 --> 01:03:44,802
I don't care. I'm
your manger now.

1386
01:03:45,639 --> 01:03:48,273
I say what Jason Mast does.

You little shit!

1389
01:04:03,891 --> 01:04:05,891
This is the thanks
that I get, huh?

1390
01:04:12,366 --> 01:04:14,967
See, I made you. I made you!

1391
01:04:19,907 --> 01:04:23,375
And I can end you. I
can fucking end you!

1392
01:04:25,779 --> 01:04:28,647
I could make you and
your brother disappear,

1393
01:04:30,784 --> 01:04:33,218
and no one would even
know that it was me.

1394
01:04:34,355 --> 01:04:36,888
'Cause that's the
power that I have!

1395
01:04:39,927 --> 01:04:41,159
What do you have?

1396
01:04:41,161 --> 01:04:46,131
What do you have, huh?
You got fucking nothing!

1397
01:04:50,404 --> 01:04:52,638
Who's gonna believe
a word that you say?

1398
01:04:54,074 --> 01:04:56,742
Your own mother
doesn't believe you.

1399
01:05:00,314 --> 01:05:02,748
It's your word against mine,

1400
01:05:05,352 --> 01:05:06,785
and who are they gonna believe?

1401
01:05:07,955 --> 01:05:10,389
Who they gonna believe. [laughs]

1402
01:05:10,391 --> 01:05:12,257
I just asked you a
fucking question.

1403
01:05:12,259 --> 01:05:14,893
Who the fuck are
they gonna believe?

1404
01:05:14,895 --> 01:05:15,794
You.

1405

Me! Me!

1406
01:05:21,435 --> 01:05:23,335
So, keep your
fucking mouth shut!

1407
01:05:26,740 --> 01:05:29,708
What am I gonna do
with that mouth?

1408
01:05:32,846 --> 01:05:35,013
I should wash it out
with soap. [laughs]

1409
01:05:40,821 --> 01:05:42,387
I got a better idea.

1410
01:05:43,991 --> 01:05:47,459
Forget about your
mouth. Turn around, boy!

1411
01:05:48,729 --> 01:05:50,696
Turn around! Oh,
it'll be all right.

01:06:17,491 --> 01:06:19,825
Jason? What's wrong?

1414

Baby, baby, baby, what's
wrong? What happened?

No, no, no.

What happened? What happened?

1417
01:06:24,898 --> 01:06:26,398
Tell me, I won't be mad.

Okay. Okay, don't tell me.

I'm not here right now.

Sorry to call so late,
I was stuck on set.

I'm so proud of you, man.

I know you don't think you
deserve this, but you do.

You are a true artist, Mr. Mast.

is going on, man?

- I'm just a little out of it.
- You on drugs?

No, sir.

I just didn't get a lot
of sleep last night and...

That includes my actors.

hour ready to work.

it's not easy,

1536
01:13:11,204 --> 01:13:12,303
a kid your age, to get clean?

1537
01:13:12,305 --> 01:13:13,538
That's amazing.

1538
01:13:13,540 --> 01:13:15,840
I owe it all to
you and Celeste.

1539
01:13:15,842 --> 01:13:17,374
- Well...
- I can't thank you enough.

1540
01:13:17,376 --> 01:13:18,909
Look, I'm so grateful for
everything you've done for me.

1541
01:13:18,912 --> 01:13:24,149
Uh, look, just, you did
this. Remember that, all right?

1542
01:13:24,151 --> 01:13:25,850
- Huh?
- I know. Thanks.

1543
01:13:25,852 --> 01:13:28,486
Come here. Come here, man.

1544
01:13:28,488 --> 01:13:31,890
All right. Get back
to work, all right?

1545
01:13:31,892 --> 01:13:33,291
Right back.

1546
01:13:48,508 --> 01:13:51,943
Hey, man! I never
thought I'd be doing this.

1547
01:13:51,945 --> 01:13:54,562
Doing, doing what?

1548
01:13:54,564 --> 01:13:57,182
I am drinking and I am
smoking with Ryan fucking Logan.

1549
01:13:58,351 --> 01:14:01,953
Man, I've seen every movie
you ever made. Twice.

1550
01:14:01,955 --> 01:14:03,555
And I think the film that
you did with Jason was

1551
01:14:03,557 --> 01:14:05,256
your best work yet.

1552
01:14:05,959 --> 01:14:07,926
That scene when you two
are by the campfire...

1553
01:14:07,928 --> 01:14:09,427
It's just a job, man. No, no!

1554
01:14:09,429 --> 01:14:10,695
It's just a job.

1555
01:14:10,697 --> 01:14:11,763
It is just like,
seriously, just like

1556
01:14:11,765 --> 01:14:12,697
- in "Boys of Summer" -
- Yeah.

1557
01:14:12,699 --> 01:14:13,798
When, when you two, it's just-

1558
01:14:13,800 --> 01:14:14,766
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. Enough.

1559
01:14:14,768 --> 01:14:16,033
Enough, enough...

1560
01:14:16,035 --> 01:14:17,301
How do you figure out how
to, you're so fucking real!

1561
01:14:17,304 --> 01:14:18,603
Dude, enough man!

1562
01:14:18,605 --> 01:14:19,504
Look, I'm not hanging out
with you because I need

1563
01:14:19,506 --> 01:14:21,272
another fan, okay?

1564
01:14:21,942 --> 01:14:24,309
Look, I, I have
enough fucking fans.

1565
01:14:25,478 --> 01:14:27,912
I am hanging out with you
because I think you're cool.

1566
01:14:29,883 --> 01:14:32,250
Why are you hanging
out with me, hm?

1567
01:14:32,953 --> 01:14:34,652
Because you want
your script read?

1568
01:14:34,654 --> 01:14:36,254
Because you think that I
can do something for you?

1569
01:14:36,256 --> 01:14:38,256
Because I am Ryan fucking Logan?

1570
01:14:41,661 --> 01:14:43,761
Man, I liked you
because you were real.

1571
01:14:44,798 --> 01:14:47,298
I'm sorry, but I'm a fan.

1572
01:14:48,635 --> 01:14:52,704
A big fucking fan, and
have been since I was 12.

1573
01:14:53,773 --> 01:14:55,506
And fuck you for
saying I'm not real.

1574
01:14:55,508 --> 01:14:57,242
I've been nothing but real
with you the whole night.

1575
01:14:59,946 --> 01:15:02,580
You know what? I do have
something I want to say to you.

1576
01:15:04,484 --> 01:15:09,287
You pick shitty fucking
movies. You're a great actor.

1577
01:15:10,757 --> 01:15:11,990
Shitty movies.

1578
01:15:13,660 --> 01:15:14,926
Last three you did?

1579
01:15:14,928 --> 01:15:17,528
Aside from the one with
Jason, sucked. No plot.

1580
01:15:17,530 --> 01:15:19,330
And, yeah, maybe I do want
you to read my script,

1581
01:15:19,332 --> 01:15:20,999
or something like it,

1582
01:15:21,001 --> 01:15:24,335
because you should be doing
something that matters!

1583
01:15:24,337 --> 01:15:26,304
Something that has
something to say!

1584
01:15:26,306 --> 01:15:29,307
- [knocking]
- Who is it?

1585
01:15:29,309 --> 01:15:30,408
It's me.

1586
01:15:34,581 --> 01:15:35,413
Where have you been?

1587
01:15:35,415 --> 01:15:37,815
Oh, looking for you.

1588
01:15:37,817 --> 01:15:39,784
[laughs] You again.

1589
01:15:41,388 --> 01:15:43,488
[Brody] Hey. Sorry I
was such a dick earlier.

1590
01:15:43,490 --> 01:15:45,723
I mean, I should go.

1591
01:15:45,725 --> 01:15:47,025
No one's going anywhere.

1592
01:15:47,027 --> 01:15:48,976
Oh yeah, Brody, please stay,

1593
01:15:48,978 --> 01:15:50,928
and tell me more about
what a great person I am.

1594
01:15:50,930 --> 01:15:53,031
I should, I should
probably go. Okay?

1595
01:15:53,033 --> 01:15:54,666
You want your script read?

1596
01:15:55,535 --> 01:15:57,468
That is messed up.

1597
01:15:58,638 --> 01:16:03,041
Come on, man, please
stay? I'll protect you.

1598
01:16:03,043 --> 01:16:04,842
Mm. Nope.

1599
01:16:04,844 --> 01:16:07,312
Dude, stay! I don't
do that shit any more.

1600
01:16:07,314 --> 01:16:09,714
Oh that's right. Well,
we'll see how long that lasts.

1601
01:16:09,716 --> 01:16:11,516
No, I should
probably go and find...

1602
01:16:11,518 --> 01:16:13,584
God, it looks like
you're not going anywhere.

1603
01:16:13,586 --> 01:16:14,852
I don't feel so well.

1604
01:16:16,089 --> 01:16:17,555
So, you were
discovered in a mall?

1605
01:16:17,557 --> 01:16:19,090
- Yeah.
- That's cool.

1606
01:16:19,092 --> 01:16:21,359
And now Jack Rossi
wants to put me in one

1607
01:16:21,361 --> 01:16:22,727
of his projects.

1608
01:16:22,729 --> 01:16:24,729
My friends back home
are gonna go crazy.

1609
01:16:24,731 --> 01:16:26,364
Maybe I could be on
yours and Alyssa's show.

1610
01:16:26,366 --> 01:16:28,066
He wants to bring
me in for a general.

1611
01:16:28,068 --> 01:16:30,401
When you go to meet with
him, bring your mother.

1612
01:16:31,471 --> 01:16:32,503
Can I please try some?

1613
01:16:32,505 --> 01:16:34,405
- No.
- Whatever, Heather.

1614
01:16:34,407 --> 01:16:35,973
I'll just find some random
guy to give it to me.

1615
01:16:35,975 --> 01:16:36,908
Okay! okay.

1616
01:16:36,910 --> 01:16:38,109
If you're gonna do it anyways,

1617
01:16:38,111 --> 01:16:39,543
I would rather
you do it with me.

1618
01:16:39,545 --> 01:16:40,978
But if you tell anyone
that I gave this to you,

1619
01:16:40,980 --> 01:16:41,913
I will deny it.

1620
01:16:41,915 --> 01:16:43,815
- Swear to God.
- I won't.

1621
01:16:43,817 --> 01:16:46,451
Just this one time,
our secret. Okay?

1622
01:16:46,453 --> 01:16:47,352
Promise.

1623
01:16:48,121 --> 01:16:50,421
[slow electronic music]

1624
01:16:58,131 --> 01:16:59,430
Dude, I feel like
I can't breathe!

1625
01:16:59,432 --> 01:17:00,698
- Dude, relax.
- Did I smoke too much?

1626
01:17:00,700 --> 01:17:01,899
I told you I can't
handle this shit.

1627
01:17:01,901 --> 01:17:03,101
Here, you're fine.
Just have another shot.

1628
01:17:03,103 --> 01:17:04,568
Dylan has some
pills you can take.

1629
01:17:04,570 --> 01:17:06,035
No, I took, I took
my fucking pills today!

1630
01:17:06,037 --> 01:17:07,503
- Well have some more.
- My god!

1631
01:17:07,507 --> 01:17:09,374
You're like, my little sister.

1632
01:17:09,376 --> 01:17:10,875
I gonna protect you.

1633
01:17:10,877 --> 01:17:12,677
Really? I never had a big
brother or sister before!

1634
01:17:12,679 --> 01:17:15,146
Well, now you do! It's me!
[both laughing]

1635
01:17:16,483 --> 01:17:17,615
Just chill, man.
I got you, okay?

1636
01:17:17,617 --> 01:17:18,549
I'll be right back.

1637
01:17:18,551 --> 01:17:19,917
No, where are you going?

1638
01:17:19,919 --> 01:17:21,452
Don't leave me...

1639
01:17:21,454 --> 01:17:23,388
Um. Here, come here.

1640
01:17:27,827 --> 01:17:30,061
Oh, god. Okay, just relax.

1641
01:17:32,098 --> 01:17:33,164
Of course I'm
gonna miss the show.

1642
01:17:33,166 --> 01:17:35,165
I love the show,

1643
01:17:35,167 --> 01:17:37,167
and I love working there and
everyone's so, so nice to me,

1644
01:17:37,170 --> 01:17:38,502
but I am getting
in Jason's movie,

1645
01:17:38,504 --> 01:17:39,837
and it's gonna be huge
and he's so talented,

1646
01:17:39,839 --> 01:17:41,506
he's like so amazing,

1647
01:17:41,508 --> 01:17:43,590
and I just, I just, I don't
even know how I could do

1648
01:17:43,592 --> 01:17:45,675
the show once I started
the movie and...

1649
01:17:45,678 --> 01:17:48,146
Oh my God! You could take
my place on the show!

1650
01:17:48,148 --> 01:17:49,781
I could like die in a car
accident or something,

1651
01:17:49,783 --> 01:17:51,449
and Caley, Caley?

1652
01:17:54,120 --> 01:17:55,586
Oh my God. Caley?

1653
01:17:57,957 --> 01:18:00,091
Baby? Caley.

1654
01:18:00,093 --> 01:18:03,428
Caley, please, please, please,
say something! Caley, Caley.

1655
01:18:03,430 --> 01:18:04,495
I love LA.

1656
01:18:12,639 --> 01:18:14,439
Still alive?

1657
01:18:14,441 --> 01:18:15,540
Barely.

1658
01:18:15,542 --> 01:18:19,210
You know, just been
embarrassing myself all night.

1659
01:18:21,714 --> 01:18:24,215
Sometimes I can
be a bit harsh,

1660
01:18:24,217 --> 01:18:26,884
especially when I'm busy
babysitting all of you.

1661
01:18:29,055 --> 01:18:31,055
Y'know, maybe you
need a babysitter.

1662
01:18:32,492 --> 01:18:34,158
That's not what I need.

1663
01:18:34,160 --> 01:18:35,626
I know what you need.

1664
01:18:37,931 --> 01:18:39,464
Are you flirting with me?

1665
01:18:40,667 --> 01:18:41,566
Maybe.

1666
01:18:47,240 --> 01:18:49,040
Meet me in your room in five.

1667
01:18:50,477 --> 01:18:51,742
Really?

1668
01:18:51,744 --> 01:18:53,511
Hurry up before
I change my mind.

1669
01:18:54,214 --> 01:18:55,112
Done!

1670
01:18:57,517 --> 01:18:59,116
I think I'm ready.
I'm gonna do it tonight.

1671
01:18:59,118 --> 01:19:01,034
I want Dylan to be my first.

1672
01:19:01,036 --> 01:19:02,953
Uh, you are not gonna lose
your virginity to Dylan Mast.

1673
01:19:02,956 --> 01:19:04,489
Yes I am. What's the big deal?

1674
01:19:04,491 --> 01:19:05,723
It's just sex.

1675
01:19:05,725 --> 01:19:07,658
Uh, it's a big deal.

1676
01:19:07,660 --> 01:19:09,494
But we have a connection.

1677
01:19:09,496 --> 01:19:10,995
No, you don't.

1678
01:19:10,997 --> 01:19:12,497
I was like in love with
him the moment I saw him.

1679
01:19:12,499 --> 01:19:13,764
Ooh, no, you weren't.

1680
01:19:40,059 --> 01:19:41,792
That's why I quit smoking
pot. I couldn't handle it.

1681
01:19:41,794 --> 01:19:43,528
It made everything
a little too real.

1682
01:19:43,530 --> 01:19:45,763
Oh, and the coke
makes the real go away?

1683
01:19:50,236 --> 01:19:52,670
I want you to know what you
said earlier messed me up.

1684
01:19:54,307 --> 01:19:55,606
What did I say?

1685
01:19:57,544 --> 01:19:58,976
You know what you said.

1686
01:20:01,848 --> 01:20:03,881
You said I was a mediocre,
coked out actress,

1687
01:20:03,883 --> 01:20:04,749
with a huge trust fund.

1688
01:20:09,155 --> 01:20:11,789
I'm so sorry. I, I, I didn't-

1689
01:20:12,892 --> 01:20:13,824
- No, it's fine!

1690
01:20:13,826 --> 01:20:15,259
It's fine. You were right!

1691
01:20:15,261 --> 01:20:16,594
No, and it made me
think and I hate people

1692
01:20:16,596 --> 01:20:17,762
that make me think.

1693
01:20:24,070 --> 01:20:26,604
Do you really think
I'm a mediocre actress?

1694
01:20:32,645 --> 01:20:34,579
- You all right?
- Uh. Yeah.

1695
01:20:34,581 --> 01:20:35,980
Uh, um, I'm, I'm just sweating.

1696
01:20:42,755 --> 01:20:44,355
Uh, we just disappeared
from the whole party.

1697
01:20:44,357 --> 01:20:47,124
- I'm gonna check on Jason.
- Hey! Just stay.

1698
01:20:47,126 --> 01:20:49,360
Okay. Just calm down.

1699
01:20:49,362 --> 01:20:50,628
Okay.

1700
01:20:55,368 --> 01:20:56,901
No! Never again.

1701
01:20:59,372 --> 01:21:02,907
Someone's awake.
No, it's fine.

1702
01:21:02,909 --> 01:21:04,041
Just go with it.

1703
01:21:14,253 --> 01:21:15,920
- Hey, baby.
- Eugh.

1704
01:21:42,382 --> 01:21:43,814
I'm so confused.

1705
01:21:46,419 --> 01:21:47,785
Don't be.

1706
01:21:49,956 --> 01:21:51,255
Get out of your head, man.

1707
01:21:51,257 --> 01:21:53,357
Stop thinking about
everything so much.

1708
01:21:54,260 --> 01:21:55,793
Hey. Just be here.

1709
01:22:02,201 --> 01:22:04,935
Believe me, I'd
love to, but I can't.

1710
01:22:06,139 --> 01:22:07,405
I can't.

1711
01:22:07,407 --> 01:22:10,174
Why? Because you're
in love with Heather?

1712
01:22:12,111 --> 01:22:13,411
I mean, do you think she
hasn't hooked up with anyone

1713
01:22:13,413 --> 01:22:14,812
else since you've been out here?

1714
01:22:14,814 --> 01:22:16,781
Because she made
out with me tonight.

1715
01:22:21,688 --> 01:22:23,788
[upbeat electronic music]

1716
01:22:50,183 --> 01:22:52,349
God, I needed that.

1717
01:22:52,351 --> 01:22:53,951
You are officially my boy toy.

1718
01:22:53,953 --> 01:22:55,186
But, I've gotta go,

1719
01:22:55,188 --> 01:22:57,021
there's still business
to handle tonight.

1720
01:22:57,023 --> 01:22:58,255
Don't you ever take a break?

1721
01:22:58,257 --> 01:22:59,457
I just did.

1722
01:22:59,459 --> 01:23:01,158
You know, lady,

1723
01:23:01,160 --> 01:23:02,093
you need more love in your
life cause I don't think

1724
01:23:02,095 --> 01:23:03,861
I've ever seen you smile.

1725
01:23:05,198 --> 01:23:06,464
Actually, you had a pretty
big grin on your face

1726
01:23:06,466 --> 01:23:08,099
about five minutes ago.

1727
01:23:08,101 --> 01:23:09,300
Eugh. You need to leave
while I get dressed.

1728
01:23:09,302 --> 01:23:10,735
Thank you very much.

1729
01:23:10,737 --> 01:23:12,102
Are you serious?
But we just has sex-

1730
01:23:12,104 --> 01:23:13,470
- Get out. Get out!
- This is my fucking room!

1731
01:23:13,473 --> 01:23:16,273
[Celeste] Get out,
boy toy! Get out!

1732
01:23:16,275 --> 01:23:17,742
What the, you're fucking crazy-

1733
01:23:17,744 --> 01:23:19,877
- [Celeste] Get the fuck out!

1734
01:23:19,879 --> 01:23:22,480
Go have your cigarette.
Stay away from Dylan Mast.

1735
01:23:22,482 --> 01:23:23,514
- I will.
- I'll meet you by the pool?

1736
01:23:23,516 --> 01:23:24,749
- Okay.
- Okay.

1737
01:23:31,524 --> 01:23:33,357
- There's my star.
- Hey, Jack.

1738
01:23:35,394 --> 01:23:37,795
I feel like you've been
avoiding me all night.

1739
01:23:37,797 --> 01:23:38,996
I haven't been avoiding you.

1740
01:23:42,468 --> 01:23:46,103
Don't think I don't know
what you and Celeste are up to.

1741
01:23:46,105 --> 01:23:47,505
What are you talking about?

1742
01:23:47,507 --> 01:23:49,774
Oh, you think I'm an idiot?

1743
01:23:49,776 --> 01:23:52,376
Celeste already told me you're
not re-signing on the show.

1744
01:23:53,479 --> 01:23:55,246
Well, I never
told Celeste that.

1745
01:23:55,248 --> 01:23:57,248
So, you are gonna
sign a new contract?

1746
01:23:59,886 --> 01:24:01,519
Would you stop the
bullshit, Heather.

1747
01:24:03,422 --> 01:24:05,956
You think you're gonna
get in Jason's movie,

1748
01:24:07,059 --> 01:24:08,459
then you don't need to re-sign
on the show cause you'll

1749
01:24:08,461 --> 01:24:10,060
be a big movie star.

1750
01:24:10,062 --> 01:24:15,132
And that, that's what you want
more than anything? Isn't it?

1751
01:24:17,003 --> 01:24:18,936
Isn't it. Isn't it?

1752
01:24:18,938 --> 01:24:20,805
Come on, Jack, make your move!

1753
01:24:20,807 --> 01:24:22,873
I could end your
fucking career.

1754
01:24:24,911 --> 01:24:27,812
Who even says I'm giving you
another season on the show?

1755
01:24:29,549 --> 01:24:31,549
Maybe I fire Heather
Hayes from the show 'cause

1756
01:24:31,551 --> 01:24:33,350
she's difficult on set,

1757
01:24:34,453 --> 01:24:36,153
or because of her
little drug problem.

1758
01:24:41,294 --> 01:24:45,129
Doesn't have to be like
that. Come on, beautiful.

1759
01:24:45,131 --> 01:24:47,231
I'm not your enemy. [laughs]

1760
01:24:51,571 --> 01:24:53,037
God, I can't do this.

1761
01:24:53,039 --> 01:24:54,505
Get off of me. Move out
of the way of the door.

1762
01:24:54,507 --> 01:24:56,073
- I want to leave.
- No.

1763
01:24:56,075 --> 01:24:57,508
This is not
gonna happen, Jack.

1764
01:24:57,510 --> 01:24:59,877
You mean it isn't
gonna happen again, Jack.

1765
01:24:59,879 --> 01:25:01,078
Get off of me!

1766
01:25:01,080 --> 01:25:04,582
I made you! Don't
you forget that!

1767
01:25:04,584 --> 01:25:07,184
You were nothing before my show!

1768
01:25:07,186 --> 01:25:09,019
Now you think you're
too good for me?

1769
01:25:09,021 --> 01:25:11,856
You fucked your way in,
and we both know it.

1770
01:25:11,858 --> 01:25:12,556
No!

1771
01:25:15,161 --> 01:25:16,360
Get off of me!

1772
01:25:16,362 --> 01:25:19,063
I made you! Don't
you forget that!

1773
01:25:19,065 --> 01:25:21,432
You were nothing before my show!

1774
01:25:21,434 --> 01:25:23,367
Now you think you're
too good for me?

1775
01:25:23,369 --> 01:25:26,003
You fucked your way in,
and we both know it.

1776
01:25:26,005 --> 01:25:28,906
That's not what
happened! Get off of me!

1777
01:25:28,908 --> 01:25:30,007
Shut the fuck up!

1778
01:25:35,414 --> 01:25:37,882
So the role is still
yours, if you want it.

1779
01:25:40,887 --> 01:25:43,053
Now you know what I want.

1780
01:25:44,891 --> 01:25:46,190
Busted. Fuck!

1781
01:25:47,894 --> 01:25:50,060
Fuck you Jack! You're going
down, you son of a bitch.

1782
01:25:50,062 --> 01:25:51,562
I got you. [laughs]

1783
01:25:54,467 --> 01:25:57,501
[Heather] Jason! I
need to talk to you.

1784
01:25:58,371 --> 01:26:01,005
Jason, please open up! Jason.

1785
01:26:02,174 --> 01:26:04,508
Jason! Open up! [panting]

1786
01:26:07,213 --> 01:26:08,646
Jason!

1787
01:26:08,648 --> 01:26:10,481
Jason, open up!
[knocking]

1788
01:26:10,483 --> 01:26:12,449
Jason, open up right now.

1789
01:26:12,451 --> 01:26:14,518
Jason, open up!
[knocking]

1790
01:26:14,520 --> 01:26:16,320
Jason, open up right...

1791
01:26:19,225 --> 01:26:21,158
What are these papers?

1792
01:26:21,160 --> 01:26:23,494
Who is this Celeste? You
made this woman your manager?

1793
01:26:23,496 --> 01:26:25,396
Are you fucking kidding me?

1794
01:26:29,568 --> 01:26:31,635
I am your mother, goddammit.

1795
01:26:33,406 --> 01:26:36,407
I am the one who got
your career started.

1796
01:26:38,010 --> 01:26:40,311
I gave up everything for
you and you are gonna leave

1797
01:26:40,313 --> 01:26:41,712
me with nothing?

1798
01:26:44,350 --> 01:26:46,016
Read your contract.

1799
01:26:48,020 --> 01:26:50,654
You get 10% of
everything until I die,

1800
01:26:50,656 --> 01:26:55,092
under one condition: you
stay out of my career,

1801
01:26:56,095 --> 01:26:57,361
and out of my life.

1802
01:26:58,464 --> 01:27:03,200
If you try to talk
to me or contact me,

1803
01:27:04,470 --> 01:27:06,637
that's a breach of contract,
and you get nothing.

1804
01:27:10,109 --> 01:27:11,709
Now, get out. We're done.

1805
01:27:14,013 --> 01:27:17,114
Baby, how can
you do this to me?

1806
01:27:19,051 --> 01:27:20,551
I am your mother.

1807
01:27:20,553 --> 01:27:22,453
No! You cared more about the
money than being my mother!

1808
01:27:22,455 --> 01:27:24,487
[Mother] No!

1809
01:27:24,489 --> 01:27:26,522
Baby, you're my son and I
just wanted you to be happy.

1810
01:27:26,525 --> 01:27:28,459
No, you wanted
me to be famous.

1811
01:27:29,695 --> 01:27:31,395
No, Jason. Baby, no.

1812
01:27:31,397 --> 01:27:33,397
No, this shit
won't work any more.

1813
01:27:33,399 --> 01:27:36,266
- Jason-
- Get out. Get out!

1814
01:27:36,268 --> 01:27:39,103
Get out of my house! My house!

1815
01:27:41,307 --> 01:27:43,007
Jason! Open up!

1816
01:27:43,776 --> 01:27:45,509
Let me in! Now!

1817
01:27:49,115 --> 01:27:51,382
- Jason, please open up!
- Hey!

1818
01:27:52,385 --> 01:27:54,151
- Hey.
- Are you okay?

1819
01:27:54,153 --> 01:27:55,652
I don't know.

1820
01:27:55,654 --> 01:27:58,155
Please, so I can talk to you.

1821
01:28:00,026 --> 01:28:01,658
Look, I, I want, I want
you know something, Heather.

1822
01:28:01,660 --> 01:28:03,794
I think you're beautiful
and you're very talented,

1823
01:28:03,796 --> 01:28:05,529
and I care about you.

1824
01:28:05,531 --> 01:28:06,330
But I would never cast you
in a role because I wanted

1825
01:28:06,332 --> 01:28:07,564
to sleep with you.

1826
01:28:07,566 --> 01:28:09,700
I want you in this
movie 'cause I think

1827
01:28:09,702 --> 01:28:11,668
you're an amazing actress.

1828
01:28:11,670 --> 01:28:13,737
I mean, all of this shit
you've been doing tonight,

1829
01:28:13,739 --> 01:28:15,239
come on, that's that's not you.

1830
01:28:15,241 --> 01:28:17,041
You are better than that!

1831
01:28:17,043 --> 01:28:18,776
This lifestyle. This
celebrity bullshit?

1832
01:28:18,778 --> 01:28:20,778
That's not why we do this.

1833
01:28:20,780 --> 01:28:22,279
People are gonna remember
you for something.

1834
01:28:22,281 --> 01:28:23,680
What's that gonna be?

1835
01:28:23,682 --> 01:28:26,417
[Both] Celebrity or an artist?

1836
01:28:27,520 --> 01:28:30,187
Jason, please.
Hey, are you okay?

1837
01:28:30,189 --> 01:28:34,725
Oh, yeah, I'm great! Now,
go find Brody, and go home.

1838
01:28:34,727 --> 01:28:37,628
I'll be in touch about
the script next week.

1839
01:28:41,734 --> 01:28:46,236
Oh, and don't worry about Jack.
I'm gonna take care of him.

01:31:58,030 --> 01:32:00,564

[surreal music]

1889
01:33:29,121 --> 01:33:31,054
And where have
you been hiding?

1890
01:33:32,858 --> 01:33:35,058
Have you been avoiding me?

1891
01:33:35,060 --> 01:33:36,559
I didn't know you
were looking for me?

1892
01:33:36,561 --> 01:33:38,061
I thought you were
looking for Heather.

1893
01:33:38,063 --> 01:33:39,796
Well, let me tell
you something, Carly.

1894
01:33:39,798 --> 01:33:41,898
I am always looking
for new talent.

1895
01:33:45,404 --> 01:33:46,803
Relax. We're just talking.

1896
01:33:48,574 --> 01:33:52,042
You know, the first time I
laid on eyes on you I knew

1897
01:33:52,044 --> 01:33:54,144
I'd seen that face.

1898
01:33:54,146 --> 01:33:56,747
You have that billboard
on Sunset. [chuckles]

1899
01:33:57,850 --> 01:33:59,883
I will bet there is not
a guy in LA that ain't

1900
01:33:59,885 --> 01:34:01,551
fantasizing about you.

1901
01:34:02,621 --> 01:34:04,554
I got to tell you, though,

1902
01:34:04,556 --> 01:34:07,457
you are even hotter
in person. [chuckles]

1903
01:34:09,762 --> 01:34:12,496
You're doing the right thing,
though, going into acting.

1904
01:34:13,432 --> 01:34:16,500
Modeling has a short lifespan.

1905
01:34:16,502 --> 01:34:18,101
That's exactly
what Celeste said.

1906
01:34:18,103 --> 01:34:20,737
She's right. You
should listen to her.

1907
01:34:21,673 --> 01:34:24,074
See, she knows what I like.

1908
01:34:24,076 --> 01:34:26,777
And she knows what it takes
to make it as an actress

1909
01:34:26,779 --> 01:34:28,612
in this business.

1910
01:34:28,614 --> 01:34:30,514
I've always wanted
to be an actress.

1911
01:34:30,516 --> 01:34:32,015
I even did all my school plays.

1912
01:34:32,017 --> 01:34:35,452
You did all your...
[laughs] Look at that face.

1913
01:34:35,454 --> 01:34:37,821
Do you know, I think you
have more star quality

1914
01:34:37,823 --> 01:34:39,489
than Heather Hayes.

1915
01:34:39,491 --> 01:34:42,192
Oh, no. She's so
gorgeous and so talented.

1916
01:34:42,194 --> 01:34:47,464
She's a fucking bitch.
Everybody knows it.

1917
01:34:49,435 --> 01:34:54,504
I wouldn't trust her if I were
you. She's got no loyalty.

1918
01:34:57,643 --> 01:34:59,576
And loyalty's everything to me.

1919
01:35:01,146 --> 01:35:03,713
Heather Hayes is finished
in this business.

1920
01:35:05,083 --> 01:35:07,217
- And do you know why?
- Why?

1921
01:35:07,219 --> 01:35:10,821
'Cause, I made her,
and I will end her.

1922
01:35:13,759 --> 01:35:15,192
Do you party?

1923
01:35:15,194 --> 01:35:18,628
- Of course, all the time.
- Good girl.

1924
01:35:24,203 --> 01:35:29,473
How would you like to be
the next Heather Hayes?

1925
01:35:30,542 --> 01:35:32,175
'Cause you're talking
to the right man.

1926
01:35:33,145 --> 01:35:37,781
I'm not comfortable.
Get off me!

1927
01:35:37,783 --> 01:35:39,850
What's the matter? Are
you not attracted to me?

1928
01:35:39,852 --> 01:35:42,619
I'm 16, you're, like,
old enough to be my dad.

1929
01:35:42,621 --> 01:35:44,855
Well that's not a very
polite thing to say, Carly.

1930
01:35:44,857 --> 01:35:47,591
It's Caley! Get off of me!

1931
01:35:47,593 --> 01:35:49,993
- Shut up!
- Get the fuck off of me!

1932
01:35:49,995 --> 01:35:52,262
- Shut up!
- Get the fuck off of me!

1933
01:35:52,264 --> 01:35:55,532
- Shut up!
- Get the fuck off of me!

1935
01:36:01,173 --> 01:36:02,506
I feel so much better, man.

1936
01:36:02,508 --> 01:36:03,707
Tonight has been a great night.

1937
01:36:03,709 --> 01:36:05,041
Things are gonna
be different, okay?

1938
01:36:05,043 --> 01:36:06,243
I'm gonna make you proud of me.

1939
01:36:06,245 --> 01:36:09,079
You need a nose
job, sweetie. [laughs]

1940
01:36:09,081 --> 01:36:11,114
You got that schnozz
from your father.

1941
01:36:11,116 --> 01:36:12,682
- Hey. Jason?
- You look like shit, bro.

1942
01:36:12,684 --> 01:36:14,017
You're not gonna eat tonight.

1943
01:36:14,019 --> 01:36:14,985
Okay. Get over here.

1944
01:36:14,987 --> 01:36:16,086
Breathe. Breathe.

1945
01:36:16,088 --> 01:36:17,787
Okay? Take one of these.

1946
01:36:17,789 --> 01:36:19,155
Take one of these.
You'll feel better.

1947
01:36:19,157 --> 01:36:21,258
Okay? Just take it.

1948
01:36:21,260 --> 01:36:22,893
Just relax. Relax, okay?

1949
01:36:22,895 --> 01:36:25,028
I'll be back to check
on you. Just stay here!

1950
01:36:25,030 --> 01:36:25,962
I'll be back.

01:36:32,037 --> 01:36:33,036

Fuck you!

1954
01:36:37,009 --> 01:36:42,012

out of my fucking house!

Hey, I was looking
for you... Caley.

1958
01:37:36,668 --> 01:37:37,767
Caley?

1959
01:37:39,905 --> 01:37:41,071
Hey, you okay?

1960
01:37:46,778 --> 01:37:48,878
Caley, did something
happen with Dylan?

1961
01:38:10,736 --> 01:38:11,751
Caley.

1962
01:38:11,753 --> 01:38:12,769
Did something happen with Jack?

1963
01:38:22,648 --> 01:38:26,383
Just stay here and don't move,
okay? It's gonna be fine.

1964

Hey, man, I was
just... Oh shit!

- Holy shit!
- Dude, help me!

01:39:29,881 --> 01:39:31,381
What are you doing?

01:39:31,383 --> 01:39:32,749
Jesus Christ! Man, just
help me lift him to the bed!

- Heather! Hey!

I need you to find Alyssa
for me, right now, okay?

1974
01:39:36,221 --> 01:39:38,354
And see if Celeste is
still here! Hey, Jason.

Hey. Jason!

1976
01:39:39,291 --> 01:39:40,724
Can you hear me? Breathe man.

that door right now!

- No!
- What?

1980
01:39:43,829 --> 01:39:44,761
- You can't yet.
- Why?

1981
01:39:44,763 --> 01:39:45,495
Can you hear me? Jason?

1982
01:39:45,497 --> 01:39:47,646
Can you hear me?

- [knocking]
- It's Celeste! Let me in!

too many people in here!

- He's gonna die!
- He's not gonna die!

I'm calling an ambulance.

1987
01:39:54,872 --> 01:39:55,971
Oh, Brody, you're not
calling them. Give me that.

1988
01:39:55,974 --> 01:39:57,173
Get the fuck out of here!

1989
01:39:57,175 --> 01:39:58,108
What the fuck is
wrong with you people?

1990
01:39:58,110 --> 01:39:58,775
He's got to get to a hospital!

1991
01:39:58,777 --> 01:40:00,009
Brody's right!

1992
01:40:00,011 --> 01:40:01,478
We've got to get
him to a hospital!

1993
01:40:01,480 --> 01:40:03,813
Everybody needs to calm down.
I've dealt with this before.

1994
01:40:03,815 --> 01:40:05,448
I've got this.
Everybody calm down.

1995
01:40:05,450 --> 01:40:07,083
He's gonna be fine.

1996
01:40:09,321 --> 01:40:10,520
[Interviewer] So, how are
you handling everything?

1997
01:40:10,522 --> 01:40:12,188
I mean, you are everywhere now.

1998
01:40:12,190 --> 01:40:14,324
Your face is on billboards,
magazine covers,

1999

it's like it happened overnight.

2000
01:40:15,794 --> 01:40:17,894
Is that weird for you?

2001
01:40:19,364 --> 01:40:22,799
It's cool, um,
I guess, y'know,

2002
01:40:22,801 --> 01:40:24,868
I'm not, I'm not sure I like it.

2003
01:40:24,870 --> 01:40:26,503
It kinda makes me nervous.

2004
01:40:26,505 --> 01:40:28,805
[Interviewer] You're
not sure you like what?

2005
01:40:28,807 --> 01:40:29,939
Being famous.

Jason?
[heart beating]

2008
01:40:40,118 --> 01:40:41,785
Jason, can you hear me?

2009
01:40:43,088 --> 01:40:45,822
Jason? Wake up!

2010
01:40:45,824 --> 01:40:46,890
- [knocking]
- What's going on in there?

2011
01:40:46,892 --> 01:40:47,857
Open the door!

2012
01:40:47,859 --> 01:40:49,893
- Oh shit.
- Don't open it!

2013
01:40:49,895 --> 01:40:52,262
- It's his brother!
- Open the door!

2014
01:40:52,264 --> 01:40:54,030
Where's Jason? Hey.

2015
01:40:54,032 --> 01:40:55,298
Hey, bro. It's me.

2016
01:40:55,300 --> 01:40:56,566
Jason!

2017
01:40:56,568 --> 01:40:57,767
- What did you give him?
- He was freaking out,

2018
01:40:57,769 --> 01:40:58,968
so I gave him something
to calm him down.

2019
01:40:58,970 --> 01:41:00,170
What was he on
tonight other than coke?

2020
01:41:00,172 --> 01:41:01,271
- Shit.
- Jesus Christ, Dylan,

2021
01:41:01,273 --> 01:41:02,105
- was he shooting?
- What!

2022
01:41:02,107 --> 01:41:03,039
[Dylan] I don't know.

2023
01:41:03,041 --> 01:41:03,840
Is there heroin in the house?

2024
01:41:03,842 --> 01:41:05,074
[Dylan] I'm not sure!

2025
01:41:05,076 --> 01:41:06,009
So he was doing
coke and heroin?

2026
01:41:06,011 --> 01:41:07,443
You gave it to him, didn't you?

2027
01:41:07,445 --> 01:41:08,278
- Wait, wait, wait!
- It's your fault, Dylan!

2028
01:41:08,280 --> 01:41:09,846
You killed him!

2029
01:41:09,848 --> 01:41:11,314
Um, wait! Wait wait wait.
[people shouting]

2030
01:41:11,316 --> 01:41:12,148
Celeste! Wait, wait, come on.

2031
01:41:12,150 --> 01:41:13,550
No! No, Jason!

2032
01:41:15,587 --> 01:41:17,020
My brother, he's convulsing.

2033
01:41:17,022 --> 01:41:18,288
We're in the Hollywood
Hills off Laurel Canyon.

2034
01:41:18,290 --> 01:41:20,924
I need you to send help. Shit!

2035
01:41:20,926 --> 01:41:24,828
Um, 10969 Mulholland. I am calm!

2036
01:41:24,830 --> 01:41:25,829
Just hurry!

2037
01:41:28,900 --> 01:41:30,533
Y'know, I'm just, I'm just
really excited about this film.

2038
01:41:30,535 --> 01:41:32,602
It's really saying
something, you know?

2039
01:41:32,604 --> 01:41:34,337
[Interviewer] I do.

2040
01:41:34,339 --> 01:41:35,538
But, what I'd really like
to talk about is the film

2041
01:41:35,540 --> 01:41:37,239
you're shooting now and
the rumors that have

2042
01:41:37,241 --> 01:41:38,941
been circulating in the
press about you missing days,

2043
01:41:38,944 --> 01:41:40,944
showing up late to set.

2044
01:41:42,047 --> 01:41:42,979
You know, I thought
we were here to talk

2045
01:41:42,981 --> 01:41:44,247
about my film that just opened.

2046
01:41:44,249 --> 01:41:46,015
[Interviewer] We
are, but my sources say

2047
01:41:46,017 --> 01:41:47,483
that you're about to be fired.

2048
01:41:47,485 --> 01:41:49,185
I thought you might
like to address that.

2049
01:41:49,187 --> 01:41:50,453
I don't.

2050
01:41:50,455 --> 01:41:52,971
[Interviewer] Okay,
and let me ask you this.

2051
01:41:52,973 --> 01:41:55,490
Is it true that you're about
to go into a rehab program?

2052
01:41:56,862 --> 01:41:58,161
You know what? This
interview is fucking done.

2053
01:41:58,163 --> 01:41:59,929
Fuck you! Fuck this!

2054
01:41:59,931 --> 01:42:00,864
You can fuck off!

2055
01:42:00,866 --> 01:42:01,598
[Interviewer] Jason!

2056
01:42:01,600 --> 01:42:04,534

[slow, surreal music]

2060
01:42:49,648 --> 01:42:50,980
[Ryan] Dylan.

2061
01:42:53,985 --> 01:42:55,652
I didn't give him the heroin.

2062
01:42:58,189 --> 01:42:59,055
[Ryan] I know.

2063
01:43:01,426 --> 01:43:02,592
Give me the gun.

2064
01:43:05,964 --> 01:43:11,034
I'm his brother. I'm
supposed to take care of him.

2065
01:43:13,972 --> 01:43:15,939
You tried to keep him sober
tonight and I should've-

2066
01:43:15,941 --> 01:43:17,973
- Stop, Dylan.

2067
01:43:17,975 --> 01:43:20,008
Hey. Jason made his
own choices, okay?

2068
01:43:20,011 --> 01:43:20,944
Give me the gun.

2069
01:43:23,982 --> 01:43:28,151
It should be me. Not him.

2070
01:43:28,153 --> 01:43:30,520
- I'm the fuck-up.
- That's not true.

2071
01:43:35,060 --> 01:43:36,960
I didn't take care of him.

2072
01:43:36,962 --> 01:43:38,528
Hey! They did
this to him, okay?

2073
01:43:38,530 --> 01:43:40,496
Hey. Jason acted
like he was fine.

2074
01:43:40,498 --> 01:43:43,466
He was never fine.
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

2075
01:43:43,468 --> 01:43:44,734
Hey! Hey!

2076
01:43:44,736 --> 01:43:47,337
Are you gonna let those
fucks kill you too? Hey.

2077
01:43:47,339 --> 01:43:50,306
Dylan, Dylan, Dylan! Look at me.

2078
01:43:53,545 --> 01:43:54,510
Look at me.

2079
01:44:02,721 --> 01:44:04,721
[Dylan sobbing]

2080
01:44:08,226 --> 01:44:11,694
What am I gonna do
without him? He...

2081
01:44:11,696 --> 01:44:14,464
I'm the fuck up. And
he's the strong one.

2082
01:44:15,734 --> 01:44:18,067
He's the strong one. [sobs]

2083
01:44:29,581 --> 01:44:31,147
Maybe he wasn't.

2084
01:45:14,059 --> 01:45:16,259
What are you both
still doing here?

2085
01:45:20,398 --> 01:45:23,232
Did you know how bad he was?

2086
01:45:23,234 --> 01:45:25,301
I didn't know he
was using again.

2087
01:45:27,672 --> 01:45:29,806
Did you see him tonight?

2088
01:45:29,808 --> 01:45:32,108
I thought it was
your job to know.

2089
01:45:33,178 --> 01:45:36,179
Excuse me? You
both need to leave.

2090
01:45:36,181 --> 01:45:37,613
The press is already
here and I have to go

2091
01:45:37,615 --> 01:45:39,148
out there and make a
statement and I don't want

2092
01:45:39,150 --> 01:45:40,816
them seeing you.

2093
01:45:40,818 --> 01:45:42,485
Is that seriously what
you're worried about right now?

2094
01:45:42,487 --> 01:45:44,620
I am trying to protect
you girls. It is-

2095
01:45:44,622 --> 01:45:47,256
- Oh, protect us? Did you
protect Jason tonight?

2096
01:45:49,761 --> 01:45:52,128
Did you protect her tonight?

2097
01:45:52,130 --> 01:45:53,729
What are you talking about?

2098
01:45:53,731 --> 01:45:56,132
I have been watching
her all night.

2099
01:45:59,204 --> 01:46:00,536
Did you see her with Jack?

2100
01:46:04,809 --> 01:46:07,710
What happened with Jack?
What did Jack do to you?

2101
01:46:07,712 --> 01:46:09,661
Tell me what happened...

2102
01:46:09,663 --> 01:46:11,613
Oh, you know exactly what
happened because you know

2103
01:46:11,616 --> 01:46:13,416
who Jack Rossi is.

2104
01:46:17,489 --> 01:46:19,455
Come on, Caley. You're
gonna come home with me.

2105
01:46:19,457 --> 01:46:20,356
Caley...

2106
01:46:31,336 --> 01:46:33,202
He did it to me, too.

2107
01:46:39,644 --> 01:46:43,913
The night that you sent
me to his hotel room

2108
01:46:45,216 --> 01:46:47,283
for that stupid TV show.

2109
01:46:52,891 --> 01:46:54,223
You're fired.

2110
01:47:23,955 --> 01:47:25,188
[Phone Answering

2111
01:47:25,190 --> 01:47:26,789

2112
01:47:26,791 --> 01:47:28,391
Leave a message, and
have an awesome day.

2113
01:47:33,231 --> 01:47:34,263
Hey. It's Jason.

2114
01:47:34,265 --> 01:47:35,531
I'm not here right now.

2115
01:47:35,533 --> 01:47:37,533

Hey.

2118
01:48:15,907 --> 01:48:17,807
You know, everyone's gonna
wake up today and think

2119
01:48:17,809 --> 01:48:20,009
they knew who Jason Mast was.

2120
01:48:22,714 --> 01:48:24,280
They have no fucking idea.

2121
01:48:26,251 --> 01:48:27,783
They're just obsessed with him,

2122
01:48:27,785 --> 01:48:30,886
because they think he has
everything that they want.

2123
01:48:32,857 --> 01:48:35,424
I wish everyone could be famous.

2124
01:48:38,363 --> 01:48:40,830
I wish everyone could get
everything that they ever

2125
01:48:40,832 --> 01:48:43,532
wanted so they could
fucking see it is not

2126
01:48:43,534 --> 01:48:44,934
what they think it is!

2127
01:48:49,007 --> 01:48:50,873
It is not what you think it is.

2128
01:48:53,811 --> 01:48:54,710
I know.

2129
01:48:57,548 --> 01:48:59,515
No, I knew him before
anyone even cared

2130
01:48:59,517 --> 01:49:01,317
who Jason Mast was.

2131
01:49:11,329 --> 01:49:13,396
He was the only
family I ever had.

2132
01:49:26,411 --> 01:49:28,377
[Ryan sobbing]

2133
01:50:00,078 --> 01:50:00,976
Hey.

2134
01:50:02,980 --> 01:50:03,879
Hey.

2135
01:50:05,983 --> 01:50:07,516
Are you okay?

2136
01:50:11,022 --> 01:50:11,754
Yeah, I'm okay.

2137
01:50:15,960 --> 01:50:17,360
We're going home.

2138
01:50:19,397 --> 01:50:21,364
Caley's gonna come with us.

2139

[Reporter] One of
Hollywood's finest young actors

2140
01:50:36,447 --> 01:50:37,913
is dead tonight.

2141
01:50:37,915 --> 01:50:40,983
Film star, Jason Mast,
died early this morning

2142
01:50:40,985 --> 01:50:43,552
at his house in the
Hollywood Hills.

2143
01:50:44,789 --> 01:50:46,122
[Reporter] It's a sad day in
Los Angeles as we regretfully

2144
01:50:46,124 --> 01:50:49,725
report the death of Hollywood
royalty, Jason Mast.

2145
01:50:51,129 --> 01:50:52,761
[Reporter] The cause of
his death is still unknown,

2146
01:50:52,763 --> 01:50:54,396
but the investigation
is looking into all

2147
01:50:54,399 --> 01:50:56,599
possibilities,
including suicide.

2148
01:50:58,469 --> 01:51:00,136
[Reporter] Jason Mast has
been most recently linked

2149
01:51:00,138 --> 01:51:03,539
to Hollywood's newest
sweetheart, Heather Hayes.

2150
01:51:03,541 --> 01:51:05,875
[Reporter] A 911 call came
from his Hollywood Hills home

2151
01:51:05,877 --> 01:51:08,144
at approximately
4:00 am this morning,

2152
01:51:08,146 --> 01:51:10,646
he was convulsing and
apparently having seizures.

2153
01:51:10,648 --> 01:51:13,449
The call came from his brother,
former actor, Dylan Mast.

2154
01:51:13,451 --> 01:51:16,118
[somber music]

2155
01:51:39,777 --> 01:51:42,778
[Camera Operator] Camera
speed, and we are rolling.

2156
01:51:42,780 --> 01:51:44,013
[Interviewer] So,
Jason, how do you feel

2157
01:51:44,015 --> 01:51:46,215
about your first
Oscar nomination?

2158
01:51:46,217 --> 01:51:49,585
Well, I'm grateful for
the nomination and honored

2159
01:51:49,587 --> 01:51:53,689
to be amongst some of the most
talented people of all time.

2160
01:51:53,691 --> 01:51:56,058
Um, but, in, in all honesty?

2161
01:51:57,462 --> 01:51:59,228
I don't think any of
this really matters.

2162
01:51:59,230 --> 01:52:01,063
It, it's not why I do it.

2163
01:52:01,065 --> 01:52:02,647
[Interviewer]
So, wait a minute,

2164
01:52:02,649 --> 01:52:04,232
are you saying you're not
happy about the nomination?

2165
01:52:04,235 --> 01:52:06,502
Oh, no, no. Not at all.

2166
01:52:06,504 --> 01:52:10,139
Um. But it doesn't make me
better than anyone else.

2167
01:52:11,742 --> 01:52:15,044
I never wanted the
fame, even as a kid.

2168
01:52:15,046 --> 01:52:17,780
I was just never comfortable
with the attention

2169
01:52:17,782 --> 01:52:20,249
that came outside of the work.

2170
01:52:20,251 --> 01:52:22,651
I think it's sad
that people care more

2171
01:52:22,653 --> 01:52:25,621
about celebrities than
what's going on in the world.

2172
01:52:25,623 --> 01:52:26,755
[Interviewer] But
that's Hollywood.

2173
01:52:26,757 --> 01:52:28,257
You know how the business works.

2174
01:52:28,259 --> 01:52:31,660
Oh, I know exactly
how the business works.

2175
01:52:33,030 --> 01:52:34,997
And the business
needs to change.

2176
01:52:34,999 --> 01:52:37,533
[Interviewer] So, then
why do you keep doing it?

2177
01:52:37,535 --> 01:52:39,535
Because I wanted
to be an artist.

2178
01:52:40,872 --> 01:52:42,638
You see artists...

2179
01:52:43,841 --> 01:52:47,676
Artists are like this lens
that we see life through.

2180
01:52:48,946 --> 01:52:53,582
They help us to think and
to feel in a more intense

2181
01:52:53,584 --> 01:52:55,117
and emotional way.

2182
01:52:55,119 --> 01:52:57,286
And that's, that's why we
fall in love with them.

2183
01:52:58,723 --> 01:53:02,157
Then we make them famous and
turn them into celebrities.

2184
01:53:03,294 --> 01:53:06,762
The money, the, the
greed, the power, uh,

2185
01:53:08,599 --> 01:53:11,901
the, the lies, that's what
kills the artist in us.

2186
01:53:11,903 --> 01:53:13,669
And, honestly, I think
we're all artists.

2187
01:53:13,671 --> 01:53:17,139
We're all, we're all
here to create something.

2188
01:53:17,141 --> 01:53:18,274
Think about that for a second.

2189
01:53:18,276 --> 01:53:22,578
You give a, a
two-year old a crayon,

2190
01:53:22,580 --> 01:53:23,846
and a, and a piece of paper,

2191
01:53:23,848 --> 01:53:25,581
and the kid knows
what to do with it.

2192
01:53:25,583 --> 01:53:29,184
They, they put the crayon to
paper and create something.

2193
01:53:30,321 --> 01:53:33,656
It's a natural instinct.
Art comes from the soul.

2194
01:53:36,327 --> 01:53:40,663
Um, sorry for rambling.

2195
01:53:40,665 --> 01:53:42,765
I just had to get that out.

2196
01:53:42,767 --> 01:53:45,134
[Interviewer] Well, I think
that was beautifully said.

2197
01:53:45,136 --> 01:53:47,236
I don't think this is the last
we'll be hearing from you.

2198
01:53:47,238 --> 01:53:49,038
No, definitely not.

2199
01:53:49,040 --> 01:53:50,673
[Interviewer] I wish you
great success with this film.

2200
01:53:50,675 --> 01:53:52,608
I think you've got a winner.

off to an explosive start.

2209
01:55:07,251 --> 01:55:08,917
The recent sexual
allegations that rocked

2210

Hollywood earlier this
year are about to be met

2211

with another major controversy.
