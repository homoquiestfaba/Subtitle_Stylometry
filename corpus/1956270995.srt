2
00:02:38,909 --> 00:02:40,461
English. I'm English.

3
00:05:40,049 --> 00:05:41,800
It's grenadiers, mate.

4
00:05:55,606 --> 00:05:56,940
Make way.

5
00:06:00,778 --> 00:06:02,363
Out of the way!

6
00:06:02,571 --> 00:06:04,031
Go, go, go!

7
00:06:04,448 --> 00:06:06,325
Along the mole. All the way.

8
00:06:06,575 --> 00:06:08,327
The ship is about to leave.

9
00:06:09,370 --> 00:06:11,497
Along the mole. All the way.
The ship is about to leave.

10
00:07:45,632 --> 00:07:47,634
Where's the bloody air force?

11
00:08:35,015 --> 00:08:37,351
The navy's requisitioned her.

12
00:08:37,518 --> 00:08:40,437
They'll be back in an hour. My
dad wants to be ready before then.

13
00:08:42,523 --> 00:08:45,150
They've told us to strip her
and load those life jackets.

14
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:48,195
Some men across the Channel,
at Dunkirk, need taking off.

15
00:08:48,570 --> 00:08:49,613
Some men?

16
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:11,885
Check fuel, Fortis 1 and 2.

17
00:09:16,139 --> 00:09:17,182
70 gallons.

18
00:09:19,518 --> 00:09:21,395
68 gallons, Fortis Leader.

19
00:09:22,271 --> 00:09:24,731
Stay down at 500
feet to leave fuel

20
00:09:24,815 --> 00:09:27,484
for 40-minute fighting
time over Dunkirk.

21
00:09:28,193 --> 00:09:31,113
Understood. Vector 128,
angels point five.

22
00:09:32,030 --> 00:09:34,449
And keep an eye on that gauge,
even when it gets lively.

23
00:09:34,616 --> 00:09:36,535
Save enough to get back.

24
00:10:45,145 --> 00:10:49,024
No French soldiers.
No French soldiers. No.

25
00:10:49,191 --> 00:10:52,569
No, no French. English only.
English only past this point.

26
00:10:52,736 --> 00:10:55,155
No. It's a British ship. No,
you have your own ships.

27
00:10:55,322 --> 00:10:56,907
Get back. Get back.

28
00:10:57,074 --> 00:10:59,201
No, you've got your own ships.
This is a British ship.

29
00:10:59,368 --> 00:11:00,702
No, get back.

30
00:11:00,869 --> 00:11:02,746
Look, get the stretchers through.
There are stretchers coming.

31
00:11:02,913 --> 00:11:04,915
Get out of the way!
Out of the way.

32
00:11:05,082 --> 00:11:08,043
Go, go. Along the mole.
All the way.

33
00:11:08,210 --> 00:11:10,629
The ship is about to leave.
About to leave.

34
00:11:10,796 --> 00:11:11,938
Along the mole. All the way.

35
00:11:12,005 --> 00:11:14,257
Along the mole. Along the mole.
All the way. All the way.

36
00:11:14,508 --> 00:11:15,609
No.

37
00:11:15,676 --> 00:11:18,387
No, English only. English only!

38
00:11:21,431 --> 00:11:22,632
No.

39
00:11:37,823 --> 00:11:39,299
Ready on the stern!

40
00:11:39,366 --> 00:11:40,567
Yes, sir.

41
00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:53,130
Man the bowline!

42
00:11:53,296 --> 00:11:54,715
Any more room?

43
00:12:02,264 --> 00:12:03,932
You have to get back.

44
00:12:11,773 --> 00:12:13,275
That's two minutes.

45
00:12:13,442 --> 00:12:15,402
You've missed it.
You've missed it.

46
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:44,681
Is that the last one?

47
00:12:45,182 --> 00:12:46,266
Aye, sir.

48
00:12:49,186 --> 00:12:50,270
Break the line.

49
00:12:54,024 --> 00:12:55,400
Come on! Come on!

50
00:13:51,790 --> 00:13:54,334
Dunkirk is so far. Why can't
they just load at Calais?

51
00:13:54,501 --> 00:13:57,003
The enemy had something
to say about it.

52
00:13:58,922 --> 00:14:01,716
Down here we're sitting ducks.

53
00:14:01,925 --> 00:14:04,553
Keep 'em peeled.
They'll come out of the sun.

54
00:14:17,357 --> 00:14:18,658
Up the line.

55
00:14:20,527 --> 00:14:22,404
We'll take it.

56
00:14:24,739 --> 00:14:26,157
Drop the gangplank!

57
00:14:26,324 --> 00:14:27,625
Yes, sir.

58
00:14:44,467 --> 00:14:45,760
Take a run at it.

59
00:15:15,624 --> 00:15:17,542
Ready on the stern line, George.

60
00:15:20,253 --> 00:15:21,796
Aren't you waiting on the navy?

61
00:15:22,047 --> 00:15:24,007
They've asked for the
Moonstone, they'll have her.

62
00:15:24,174 --> 00:15:25,342
And her captain.

63
00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:27,719
And his son.

64
00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:31,973
Thanks for the help, George.

65
00:15:35,518 --> 00:15:37,020
What are you doing?

66
00:15:37,187 --> 00:15:38,355
You do know where we're going?

67
00:15:40,190 --> 00:15:41,491
France.

68
00:15:42,734 --> 00:15:44,152
Into war, George.

69
00:15:45,195 --> 00:15:46,404
I'll be useful, sir.

70
00:15:54,996 --> 00:15:56,456
Bandit, 11 o'clock.

71
00:15:57,457 --> 00:15:58,867
Break.

72
00:16:12,222 --> 00:16:13,523
He is on me.

73
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:16,893
I'm on him.

74
00:16:52,095 --> 00:16:55,056
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight...

75
00:16:55,265 --> 00:16:56,466
Oi, you two.

76
00:16:56,474 --> 00:16:57,809
Get a shift on.

77
00:16:59,477 --> 00:17:02,355
Yeah, pull him tight.
Tie a knot in it.

78
00:17:02,522 --> 00:17:04,441
Back up the line. Both of you.

79
00:17:04,607 --> 00:17:06,026
Off you go.

80
00:17:06,192 --> 00:17:07,360
Off you go!

81
00:17:07,527 --> 00:17:09,863
That last barrage has
damaged the rudder.

82
00:17:10,196 --> 00:17:11,364
Okay.

83
00:17:49,778 --> 00:17:50,879
Mr. Dawson!

84
00:17:50,945 --> 00:17:52,322
One of ours, George.

85
00:19:02,475 --> 00:19:04,644
On my mark, Fortis 2.
Draw him left.

86
00:19:06,813 --> 00:19:08,606
Three, two, one.

87
00:19:09,149 --> 00:19:10,591
Mark.

88
00:19:24,455 --> 00:19:25,840
Clear.

89
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:30,670
Is he down?

90
00:19:39,262 --> 00:19:40,513
Yeah, he's down for the count.

91
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:49,230
Fortis Leader, one bandit down.

92
00:19:53,151 --> 00:19:55,028
Fortis Leader, do you read?

93
00:20:00,742 --> 00:20:04,287
Fortis 2, I have you to my port.
I have no eyes on Fortis Leader. Over.

94
00:20:04,454 --> 00:20:06,581
Understood, Fortis 1.

95
00:20:06,748 --> 00:20:08,166
Orbit for a look.

96
00:20:20,887 --> 00:20:22,138
How long, Lieutenant?

97
00:20:22,305 --> 00:20:25,791
We need to run a new cable, sir.
They're scrambling.

98
00:20:31,648 --> 00:20:34,567
Colonel, you're gonna have to decide
how many more wounded to evacuate.

99
00:20:34,734 --> 00:20:37,320
One stretcher takes the
space of 7 standing men.

100
00:20:37,487 --> 00:20:38,571
Excuse me.

101
00:20:52,877 --> 00:20:54,712
Rear Admiral.
Commander.

102
00:20:57,298 --> 00:20:58,675
How is the perimeter?

103
00:20:58,841 --> 00:21:00,343
Shrinking every day.

104
00:21:00,802 --> 00:21:03,596
But between our rear guard and
the French, we're holding the line.

105
00:21:04,097 --> 00:21:05,932
And the enemy tanks have stopped.

106
00:21:06,099 --> 00:21:07,475
Why have they stopped?

107
00:21:08,059 --> 00:21:09,185
Waste precious tanks

108
00:21:09,394 --> 00:21:11,204
when they can pick us off from
the air like fish in a barrel?

109
00:21:11,271 --> 00:21:14,315
How long does London expect the army
to hold out before we make terms?

110
00:21:14,482 --> 00:21:15,783
Make terms?

111
00:21:16,150 --> 00:21:19,487
They're not stopping here.
We need to get our army back.

112
00:21:20,071 --> 00:21:22,782
Britain is next and then
the rest of the world.

113
00:21:22,949 --> 00:21:24,033
Christ.

114
00:21:24,826 --> 00:21:27,370
I mean, you can practically
see it from here.

115
00:21:27,537 --> 00:21:28,663
What?

116
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:30,832
Home.

117
00:21:31,916 --> 00:21:33,543
What about the French?

118
00:21:33,710 --> 00:21:36,045
Publicly, Churchill has told
them "Bras dessous."

119
00:21:36,212 --> 00:21:38,214
Arm in arm, leaving together.

120
00:21:38,423 --> 00:21:39,732
And privately?

121
00:21:39,799 --> 00:21:41,301
We need our army back.

122
00:21:41,884 --> 00:21:43,928
How many men are
they talking about, sir?

123
00:21:44,929 --> 00:21:48,433
Churchill wants 30,000. Ramsay
is hoping we can give him 45.

124
00:21:50,018 --> 00:21:52,270
There are 400,000 men
on this beach, sir.

125
00:21:53,229 --> 00:21:55,356
We'll just have to do our best.

126
00:21:56,524 --> 00:21:59,068
Right, well, this mole
stays open at all costs.

127
00:22:00,278 --> 00:22:04,240
We're in artillery range from the west.
If anything else sinks here,

128
00:22:04,407 --> 00:22:06,409
the mole is blocked and we're stuffed.

129
00:22:06,576 --> 00:22:08,119
Can't we load from the beaches?

130
00:22:08,286 --> 00:22:09,829
Better than standing out here
when the dive bombs come.

131
00:22:09,996 --> 00:22:11,372
It's impossible.
Too shallow?

132
00:22:11,539 --> 00:22:13,516
'Cause anything that drafts
over 3 feet can't get near.

133
00:22:13,583 --> 00:22:16,669
We don't have enough small boats
to ferry men to the destroyers.

134
00:22:17,211 --> 00:22:20,089
The mole it is, then, gentlemen.

135
00:23:11,557 --> 00:23:13,726
Can you swim it?

136
00:23:15,770 --> 00:23:16,938
Dad, can you get closer?

137
00:23:17,688 --> 00:23:19,148
Can't risk it!

138
00:23:20,733 --> 00:23:21,734
Hang on.

139
00:24:11,325 --> 00:24:12,577
What's your name?

140
00:24:31,846 --> 00:24:33,097
Wreckage below.

141
00:24:34,307 --> 00:24:36,058
Is it more of the 109?

142
00:24:36,225 --> 00:24:37,393
No.

143
00:24:37,685 --> 00:24:39,353
It's Fortis Leader. Over.

144
00:24:40,855 --> 00:24:42,056
You think he got out?

145
00:24:42,064 --> 00:24:43,365
I didn't see a 'chute.

146
00:24:44,859 --> 00:24:46,819
Record his position.

147
00:24:46,986 --> 00:24:49,197
Then set heading 128,

148
00:24:49,363 --> 00:24:51,240
height 1,000. Over.

149
00:24:51,407 --> 00:24:53,493
Vector 128, angels one.
Understood.

150
00:24:59,540 --> 00:25:00,875
Fortis 2, what's your fuel?

151
00:25:02,251 --> 00:25:03,377
50 gallons. Over.

152
00:25:03,878 --> 00:25:06,214
50 gallons.

153
00:25:09,842 --> 00:25:11,761
All right, keep letting me know.

154
00:25:11,928 --> 00:25:13,721
My gauge took a bit of
a knock back there.

155
00:25:15,306 --> 00:25:16,807
Shouldn't you turn back?

156
00:25:16,974 --> 00:25:18,476
No, no.

157
00:25:19,101 --> 00:25:21,479
I'm fairly confident
it's just the gauge.

158
00:26:50,693 --> 00:26:52,737
She is going down.
Cut her loose!

159
00:26:52,903 --> 00:26:53,988
What about the wounded?

160
00:26:55,281 --> 00:26:57,658
Abandon ship! Abandon ship.

161
00:27:00,036 --> 00:27:01,495
Cut her loose and push her off.

162
00:27:01,662 --> 00:27:03,414
We can't let her sink at the mole.

163
00:27:04,123 --> 00:27:05,958
Push the bloody boat off!

164
00:27:13,424 --> 00:27:14,725
Help us!

165
00:28:27,748 --> 00:28:29,625
Do you want to come below?

166
00:28:29,792 --> 00:28:31,711
It's much warmer.

167
00:28:32,628 --> 00:28:33,796
It's out of the wind.

168
00:28:33,963 --> 00:28:35,381
Here you go.

169
00:28:38,092 --> 00:28:39,677
Leave him be, George.

170
00:28:39,844 --> 00:28:41,679
He feels safer on deck.

171
00:28:42,596 --> 00:28:44,265
You would too if you'd
been bombed.

172
00:28:44,432 --> 00:28:45,733
U-boat.

173
00:28:47,768 --> 00:28:49,937
It was a U-boat.

174
00:28:53,858 --> 00:28:55,151
Get him some more tea, George.

175
00:29:10,166 --> 00:29:12,460
Right, we're about 5 minutes out,

176
00:29:12,626 --> 00:29:14,295
so climb to 2,000. Over.

177
00:29:14,462 --> 00:29:15,588
That's more fuel.

178
00:29:15,755 --> 00:29:17,456
I know, but I don't want
to get jumped again.

179
00:29:17,465 --> 00:29:18,566
Let's get a decent altitude.

180
00:29:18,632 --> 00:29:20,551
We can dive down on the
bastards from above. Over.

181
00:29:20,718 --> 00:29:22,219
Understood. Angels two.

182
00:29:22,386 --> 00:29:23,587
Over.

183
00:29:25,890 --> 00:29:26,891
Right, Highlanders.

184
00:29:27,433 --> 00:29:29,018
Let's find you another ship.

185
00:30:41,131 --> 00:30:42,532
Come on.

186
00:30:45,135 --> 00:30:47,721
Everyone else, keep climbing.
Climb on the deck.

187
00:30:48,264 --> 00:30:51,016
Climb on the deck.

188
00:30:51,517 --> 00:30:53,561
Watch your heads on the rail.
Watch it.

189
00:30:55,271 --> 00:30:57,106
That's right, keep going down.
Take a blanket.

190
00:30:57,273 --> 00:30:58,399
Down you go.
Put this on, my love.

191
00:30:59,191 --> 00:31:02,069
Down you go. Keep going down.

192
00:31:02,236 --> 00:31:04,363
There's a nice cup of
tea for you down there.

193
00:31:04,530 --> 00:31:05,631
Keep moving down.

194
00:31:05,698 --> 00:31:07,366
Take a blanket.

195
00:31:08,576 --> 00:31:11,077
Try and make some room.
Keep moving down, boys.

196
00:31:12,496 --> 00:31:13,881
This way.

197
00:31:14,707 --> 00:31:16,292
A cup of tea down there.

198
00:31:41,025 --> 00:31:43,986
There you go. Down there.
Move down there.

199
00:32:03,213 --> 00:32:04,873
What's wrong with your friend?

200
00:32:24,026 --> 00:32:25,677
He is looking for a quick way out.

201
00:32:27,696 --> 00:32:29,114
In case we go down.

202
00:33:07,653 --> 00:33:09,071
Where are we going?

203
00:33:09,238 --> 00:33:10,739
Dunkirk.

204
00:33:12,783 --> 00:33:14,868
No, no, we're going to England.

205
00:33:16,578 --> 00:33:18,580
We have to go to Dunkirk first.

206
00:33:19,123 --> 00:33:21,917
Look, I'm not going back.

207
00:33:23,335 --> 00:33:24,878
I'm not going back.

208
00:33:25,838 --> 00:33:27,131
Look at it.

209
00:33:28,382 --> 00:33:30,009
If we go there, we'll die.

210
00:33:37,182 --> 00:33:38,483
I see your point, son.

211
00:33:39,059 --> 00:33:41,145
Well, let's plot a course.

212
00:33:44,481 --> 00:33:47,151
You can take your tea
below and warm up.

213
00:33:49,737 --> 00:33:52,322
Peter, have we got space
for a man to lie down?

214
00:33:52,448 --> 00:33:53,866
Yeah.

215
00:33:59,288 --> 00:34:00,664
Here, come on.

216
00:34:09,465 --> 00:34:10,932
Careful.

217
00:34:16,972 --> 00:34:18,265
Just in there.

218
00:34:19,016 --> 00:34:20,476
I'll get you some more tea.

219
00:34:37,242 --> 00:34:38,786
Is he a coward, Mr. Dawson?

220
00:34:38,952 --> 00:34:40,579
He's shell-shocked, George.

221
00:34:40,746 --> 00:34:42,331
He's not himself.

222
00:34:45,084 --> 00:34:47,461
He may never be himself again.

223
00:34:56,011 --> 00:34:57,221
Here you are.

224
00:35:14,780 --> 00:35:16,698
40 gallons, Fortis 1.

225
00:35:18,242 --> 00:35:19,368
40 gallons, understood.

226
00:35:23,539 --> 00:35:24,998
Heinkel, 11 o'clock.

227
00:35:25,415 --> 00:35:28,335
She is lining up to drop her
load on that minesweeper.

228
00:35:28,502 --> 00:35:29,603
Fighters?

229
00:35:29,670 --> 00:35:32,131
Yeah, 109s off her starboard.

230
00:35:33,215 --> 00:35:34,675
I'm on the bomber.

231
00:36:26,476 --> 00:36:27,477
Got him! Got him!

232
00:36:59,843 --> 00:37:01,637
She is turning.
You must've damaged her.

233
00:37:02,012 --> 00:37:03,222
Where's the escort?

234
00:37:03,388 --> 00:37:04,556
Well, I got one of...

235
00:37:05,224 --> 00:37:06,225
Jesus!

236
00:37:25,035 --> 00:37:26,286
I'm going down.

237
00:37:26,453 --> 00:37:27,996
I'm on him. Bail out.

238
00:37:48,183 --> 00:37:50,201
No, the swell looks good.
I'm ditching.

239
00:38:10,580 --> 00:38:11,832
Don't leave us!

240
00:38:12,749 --> 00:38:14,334
Come back!

241
00:38:14,876 --> 00:38:17,379
Wait for us!
Help! Help us!

242
00:38:20,215 --> 00:38:23,635
Pick us up! Pick us up!

243
00:38:27,347 --> 00:38:28,807
Come back!

244
00:38:30,559 --> 00:38:31,768
Torpedo!

245
00:39:03,050 --> 00:39:07,012
Abandon ship! Abandon ship!

246
00:40:53,535 --> 00:40:54,744
Help!

247
00:40:54,911 --> 00:40:56,580
Get us out of here!

248
00:41:11,303 --> 00:41:12,596
Spitfires, George.

249
00:41:12,762 --> 00:41:15,098
Greatest plane ever built.

250
00:41:18,935 --> 00:41:19,936
You didn't even look.

251
00:41:21,313 --> 00:41:23,273
Rolls-Royce Merlin engines.

252
00:41:24,107 --> 00:41:27,319
Sweetest sound you
could hear out here.

253
00:41:28,111 --> 00:41:29,412
Hello?

254
00:41:30,780 --> 00:41:32,782
Could you open the door?

255
00:41:32,949 --> 00:41:34,493
Hello? Can you hear me?

256
00:41:36,036 --> 00:41:38,330
Open the door!

257
00:41:38,747 --> 00:41:40,123
Do you hear me?

258
00:41:42,459 --> 00:41:43,752
He wants to come out.

259
00:41:43,919 --> 00:41:45,921
What have you done?
Locked him in?

260
00:41:46,087 --> 00:41:47,589
Let him out, for God's sake.

261
00:41:47,756 --> 00:41:48,757
Hello?

262
00:41:50,717 --> 00:41:52,385
Let me out!

263
00:42:06,900 --> 00:42:09,361
You haven't turned around.

264
00:42:11,947 --> 00:42:13,740
No. We have a job to do.

265
00:42:15,116 --> 00:42:18,286
Job? This is a pleasure yacht.

266
00:42:18,453 --> 00:42:21,248
You're weekend sailors,
not the bloody navy.

267
00:42:21,915 --> 00:42:23,542
A man your age?

268
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,461
Men my age dictate this war.

269
00:42:26,628 --> 00:42:29,339
Why should we be allowed
to send our children to fight it?

270
00:42:29,506 --> 00:42:31,258
You should be at home.

271
00:42:31,341 --> 00:42:35,011
Well, there won't be any home if we
allow a slaughter across the Channel.

272
00:42:42,060 --> 00:42:44,387
He's turning tail.
I'm gonna get after him.

273
00:42:45,689 --> 00:42:46,790
Good luck.

274
00:42:46,856 --> 00:42:49,859
Watch your fuel.
You're at 15 gallons.

275
00:42:52,487 --> 00:42:53,947
15 gallons, understood.

276
00:42:56,032 --> 00:42:57,617
Best of luck, Collins.

277
00:43:00,662 --> 00:43:02,831
Collins, do you read?

278
00:44:04,643 --> 00:44:06,811
No! No!

279
00:44:06,978 --> 00:44:08,688
Get off! Get off!

280
00:44:09,230 --> 00:44:11,066
Piss off, the both of you.
It's too crowded.

281
00:44:11,232 --> 00:44:12,684
You can't leave us.

282
00:44:13,568 --> 00:44:15,511
Make some room.
No.

283
00:44:16,696 --> 00:44:18,089
No. Get off.

284
00:44:18,156 --> 00:44:19,632
You men, leave off.
You'll capsize the boat.

285
00:44:19,699 --> 00:44:21,968
She is gone over twice
on the way out here.

286
00:44:22,035 --> 00:44:23,620
You have to stay calm.
There are plenty of boats.

287
00:44:23,828 --> 00:44:24,929
Calm?

288
00:44:24,996 --> 00:44:27,748
Wait till you get torpedoed,
then tell us to be calm.

289
00:44:27,791 --> 00:44:29,184
You have life jackets?

290
00:44:29,250 --> 00:44:30,585
Yes, they do.

291
00:44:30,752 --> 00:44:32,712
Don't panic, boys.
The water's not too rough

292
00:44:32,879 --> 00:44:34,063
or too cold.

293
00:44:34,130 --> 00:44:35,674
We're heading back to the beach.

294
00:44:35,840 --> 00:44:38,093
Let's go to Dover.
Yeah.

295
00:44:38,843 --> 00:44:40,512
We can't make it across
the Channel in this, lads.

296
00:44:40,679 --> 00:44:44,140
We need to get back to the
beach and wait for another ride.

297
00:44:44,474 --> 00:44:47,268
You men in the water, float
here, save your strength.

298
00:44:47,435 --> 00:44:48,978
We'll come back for you.

299
00:44:49,145 --> 00:44:50,546
Oars in.

300
00:44:51,272 --> 00:44:53,983
Together, pull!

301
00:44:55,235 --> 00:44:57,529
Together, pull.

302
00:44:59,864 --> 00:45:01,065
Pull!

303
00:45:01,908 --> 00:45:04,077
Together, pull!

304
00:45:06,287 --> 00:45:07,630
Pull.

305
00:45:08,915 --> 00:45:11,376
Together, pull.

306
00:45:14,629 --> 00:45:16,798
There is no hiding from this, son.

307
00:45:19,092 --> 00:45:21,761
What is it you think you can
do out there, on this thing?

308
00:45:21,970 --> 00:45:25,098
There's not just us.
A call went out.

309
00:45:25,265 --> 00:45:27,308
We aren't the only ones
to answer, you know.

310
00:45:27,475 --> 00:45:29,144
You don't even have guns.

311
00:45:29,519 --> 00:45:30,520
Do you have a gun?

312
00:45:30,687 --> 00:45:33,440
Yes, of course. A rifle, a 303.

313
00:45:33,606 --> 00:45:36,651
Did it help you against the
dive bombers and the U-boats?

314
00:45:37,861 --> 00:45:39,529
You're an old fool.

315
00:45:40,739 --> 00:45:42,574
I'm not going back.

316
00:45:43,158 --> 00:45:44,409
I'm not going back.

317
00:45:45,118 --> 00:45:46,119
Turn it around.

318
00:45:47,203 --> 00:45:48,621
I'm not turning round.

319
00:45:49,289 --> 00:45:50,457
Turn it around!

320
00:45:52,208 --> 00:45:53,418
Turn it.

321
00:45:55,420 --> 00:45:56,880
Calm it down, mate.
Turn it around!

322
00:45:57,046 --> 00:45:58,147
Wait, wait!

323
00:45:58,214 --> 00:45:59,632
Calm it down, mate.

324
00:46:01,092 --> 00:46:02,393
George?

325
00:46:02,927 --> 00:46:04,328
George.

326
00:46:06,723 --> 00:46:08,424
What have you done?

327
00:46:09,434 --> 00:46:11,294
Okay, you're all right, George.

328
00:46:11,644 --> 00:46:13,312
You're all right.

329
00:46:13,521 --> 00:46:16,524
Hang on. Okay. Okay, just...

330
00:46:16,691 --> 00:46:18,193
That's it. That's good enough.

331
00:46:18,359 --> 00:46:21,279
It's gonna keep some
pressure on. There we go.

332
00:46:21,446 --> 00:46:23,031
There we go.

333
00:46:23,198 --> 00:46:24,449
Can you hear me, George?

334
00:48:59,020 --> 00:49:00,480
Come on, lads!

335
00:49:01,773 --> 00:49:04,609
Come on! Come on, boys!

336
00:51:10,109 --> 00:51:11,277
It's a pier.

337
00:51:12,361 --> 00:51:14,246
For when the water comes in.

338
00:51:18,493 --> 00:51:20,169
The tide is turning now.

339
00:51:21,954 --> 00:51:23,355
How can you tell?

340
00:51:25,416 --> 00:51:26,876
The bodies come back.

341
00:52:11,045 --> 00:52:12,713
Hey, Highlanders!

342
00:52:22,640 --> 00:52:24,308
Hey, Highlanders!

343
00:52:24,475 --> 00:52:26,085
What's that way?

344
00:52:26,310 --> 00:52:28,553
A boat. She is grounded.

345
00:52:29,063 --> 00:52:31,449
Not when the tide comes in,
she is not.

346
00:52:48,416 --> 00:52:51,043
Be a brave lad.

347
00:52:53,588 --> 00:52:55,047
You and Mr. Dawson?

348
00:52:57,133 --> 00:52:59,284
It's the best thing I've ever done.

349
00:52:59,302 --> 00:53:01,821
You're all right. You're okay.

350
00:53:12,773 --> 00:53:15,376
Sea Cadet. It's the only
thing I've ever done.

351
00:53:15,443 --> 00:53:18,112
It's all right. It's okay.
Just have some water.

352
00:53:20,448 --> 00:53:22,216
I told my dad...

353
00:53:22,283 --> 00:53:24,452
I've done nothing at school

354
00:53:26,370 --> 00:53:28,539
and that I would do
something one day.

355
00:53:31,334 --> 00:53:33,794
Maybe get in the local paper.

356
00:53:34,045 --> 00:53:36,255
Maybe my teachers would see it.

357
00:53:36,422 --> 00:53:37,965
Okay, get some rest.

358
00:53:38,633 --> 00:53:41,135
I need you back up on deck
as soon as you're able.

359
00:53:42,428 --> 00:53:43,729
I can't.

360
00:53:44,138 --> 00:53:45,681
What?

361
00:53:49,602 --> 00:53:51,237
I can't see.

362
00:54:51,331 --> 00:54:52,632
Sir.

363
00:54:53,207 --> 00:54:56,268
The French have been forced
back on the western side.

364
00:54:56,585 --> 00:54:59,120
They're still holding a perimeter?
For now.

365
00:55:00,673 --> 00:55:03,217
Officer coming through. Move
yourselves. Move yourselves.

366
00:55:13,728 --> 00:55:15,162
Where are the destroyers?

367
00:55:15,229 --> 00:55:17,072
There'll be one soon.

368
00:55:19,900 --> 00:55:21,001
One?

369
00:55:21,027 --> 00:55:23,712
After yesterday's losses, it's
one ship on the mole at a time.

370
00:55:23,779 --> 00:55:24,964
The battle is here.

371
00:55:25,031 --> 00:55:26,632
What the hell are they
saving them for?

372
00:55:26,699 --> 00:55:28,259
The next battle.

373
00:55:28,326 --> 00:55:29,885
The one for Britain.

374
00:55:29,952 --> 00:55:32,212
It's the same with the planes.

375
00:55:34,040 --> 00:55:35,966
But it's right there.

376
00:55:36,375 --> 00:55:37,476
You can practically...

377
00:55:37,543 --> 00:55:39,587
Seeing home doesn't help
us get there, Colonel.

378
00:55:39,754 --> 00:55:41,714
They need to send more ships.

379
00:55:42,631 --> 00:55:44,816
Every hour the enemy pushes closer.

380
00:55:45,051 --> 00:55:47,453
They've activated
the small vessels pool.

381
00:55:48,012 --> 00:55:49,113
Small vessels?

382
00:55:49,180 --> 00:55:51,640
It's the list of civilian
boats for requisition.

383
00:55:52,141 --> 00:55:53,442
Civilian?

384
00:55:54,977 --> 00:55:56,729
We need destroyers.

385
00:55:56,896 --> 00:55:58,647
Small boats can load from the beach.

386
00:55:58,814 --> 00:56:00,066
Not in these conditions.

387
00:56:00,232 --> 00:56:02,735
Well, I'd rather face waves
than dive bombers.

388
00:56:05,696 --> 00:56:08,449
No, you're right.
They won't get up in this.

389
00:56:09,784 --> 00:56:12,578
The Royal Engineers are
building piers from lorries.

390
00:56:12,745 --> 00:56:15,373
At least that should help us
when the tide comes back.

391
00:56:15,539 --> 00:56:17,708
Well, we'll know in 6 hours' time.

392
00:56:18,709 --> 00:56:20,127
I thought the tides were every three?

393
00:56:21,962 --> 00:56:24,757
Then it's good that you're
army and I'm navy, isn't it?

394
00:56:26,217 --> 00:56:28,511
There. Vanquisher.

395
00:56:43,317 --> 00:56:44,627
Where is the crew?

396
00:56:44,693 --> 00:56:47,070
Probably got spooked
after they ran aground.

397
00:56:47,363 --> 00:56:49,306
Scarpered up the beach.

398
00:56:49,365 --> 00:56:50,466
Why?

399
00:56:50,533 --> 00:56:54,044
'Cause we're outside the perimeter.
Enemy could be right there.

400
00:56:54,912 --> 00:56:57,431
All right, best shut
ourselves inside, boys.

401
00:56:57,498 --> 00:56:59,799
Wait for the high tide.
How long is that?

402
00:57:00,418 --> 00:57:02,344
Every three hours.

403
00:57:25,609 --> 00:57:27,795
I've put a bit of pressure on it.

404
00:57:27,862 --> 00:57:30,022
Strapped him up, made
him comfortable.

405
00:57:31,073 --> 00:57:32,274
What?

406
00:57:34,410 --> 00:57:35,911
It's bad, Dad.

407
00:57:38,414 --> 00:57:40,315
Well, should we turn back?

408
00:57:46,297 --> 00:57:47,898
We've come so far.

409
00:57:48,674 --> 00:57:50,576
Dad, is that one of ours?

410
00:57:51,719 --> 00:57:55,514
That's a Heinkel. They'll
go for that minesweeper there.

411
00:57:55,514 --> 00:57:57,466
Hang on. Shouldn't we stand
by to pick up survivors?

412
00:57:57,475 --> 00:57:59,351
To do that we have to
survive ourselves.

413
00:58:04,106 --> 00:58:06,475
Poke your head out. See
if the water has come in.

414
00:58:11,739 --> 00:58:13,740
Talkative sod, aren't you?

415
00:58:39,350 --> 00:58:41,143
It's barely come in at all.

416
00:58:41,310 --> 00:58:43,479
Fuck's sake.
Calm down.

417
00:58:43,646 --> 00:58:45,814
What goes out comes
back in again, right?

418
00:58:45,981 --> 00:58:47,399
Yeah, but how long?

419
00:59:03,999 --> 00:59:05,300
Spitfires!

420
00:59:05,876 --> 00:59:07,119
Come on.

421
00:59:13,551 --> 00:59:14,893
Come on, come on.

422
00:59:23,352 --> 00:59:24,687
Dad, he got him.

423
00:59:24,853 --> 00:59:26,438
Yeah! Yeah!

424
00:59:33,779 --> 00:59:35,322
The Heinkel's moving off.

425
00:59:40,452 --> 00:59:41,453
Yeah.

426
00:59:43,080 --> 00:59:44,081
Oh, no.

427
00:59:46,041 --> 00:59:47,835
Smoke from the Spitfire.

428
00:59:49,169 --> 00:59:51,005
Watch for a parachute!

429
00:59:57,845 --> 00:59:58,946
Oi.

430
01:00:51,565 --> 01:00:52,900
Are you German?

431
01:00:53,067 --> 01:00:54,401
No, Dutch. Dutch!

432
01:00:55,778 --> 01:00:57,079
Merchant navy.

433
01:00:57,613 --> 01:00:59,114
Here to pick you up.
To help you.

434
01:00:59,281 --> 01:01:00,949
Why'd you leave your boat?

435
01:01:01,116 --> 01:01:02,368
In case the Germans come.

436
01:01:02,993 --> 01:01:05,079
We wait up the beach.

437
01:01:05,245 --> 01:01:06,872
With the soldiers.
Wait for the tide.

438
01:01:07,039 --> 01:01:09,333
You came back. The tide must be in.

439
01:01:10,501 --> 01:01:12,211
Coming. Coming, yes.

440
01:01:12,670 --> 01:01:14,546
But more hours till we float.

441
01:01:14,838 --> 01:01:15,939
Hours?

442
01:01:16,006 --> 01:01:17,466
Why'd you come back?

443
01:01:19,385 --> 01:01:21,252
Not so heavy when I left.

444
01:01:33,816 --> 01:01:35,401
No 'chute!

445
01:01:40,447 --> 01:01:42,148
Best of luck, Collins.

446
01:01:46,995 --> 01:01:48,872
Collins, do you read?

447
01:02:14,982 --> 01:02:16,524
He is down.

448
01:02:59,151 --> 01:03:01,752
Dad. Dad, watch the engine.

449
01:03:02,404 --> 01:03:05,265
Dad, he is down.
There was no 'chute.

450
01:03:09,161 --> 01:03:10,896
Dad, come on.
There was no 'chute.

451
01:03:11,497 --> 01:03:14,898
He is probably dead. Damn it,
I hear you, Peter. I hear you.

452
01:03:18,170 --> 01:03:19,880
He may be alive. Maybe.

453
01:03:21,924 --> 01:03:23,759
We may be able to help him.

454
01:04:17,354 --> 01:04:19,606
No. Then they'll
know we're in here.

455
01:04:19,773 --> 01:04:21,275
Why else are they
shooting at us?

456
01:04:21,775 --> 01:04:23,318
Look at the grouping.

457
01:04:27,155 --> 01:04:28,615
Target practice.

458
01:05:29,843 --> 01:05:33,263
Go. Plug it. Go, go.

459
01:05:53,492 --> 01:05:54,785
We have to plug it.

460
01:05:54,952 --> 01:05:56,620
After you, mate.

461
01:06:18,684 --> 01:06:20,185
You ready? Go!

462
01:06:24,856 --> 01:06:27,759
How do we get off? Do we
need to ditch some ballast?

463
01:06:27,776 --> 01:06:29,669
Weight! Do we need
to lose weight?

464
01:06:29,736 --> 01:06:31,588
Weight. Weight, yes.

465
01:06:31,655 --> 01:06:32,990
Yes.

466
01:06:33,156 --> 01:06:34,933
Somebody needs to get off.

467
01:06:35,575 --> 01:06:37,094
Well volunteered.

468
01:06:37,160 --> 01:06:39,104
We don't need a volunteer.

469
01:06:39,162 --> 01:06:41,389
I know someone who
ought to get off.

470
01:06:43,250 --> 01:06:44,851
This one.

471
01:06:45,585 --> 01:06:46,978
He is a German spy.

472
01:06:47,045 --> 01:06:48,522
Don't be daft.

473
01:06:48,588 --> 01:06:50,632
He's a fucking Jerry.

474
01:06:51,008 --> 01:06:53,593
Have you noticed he
hasn't said a word?

475
01:06:54,803 --> 01:06:56,571
'Cause I have.

476
01:06:56,847 --> 01:06:57,948
He don't speak English.

477
01:06:58,015 --> 01:07:01,284
If he does it's with an accent that
is thicker than sauerkraut sauce.

478
01:07:01,351 --> 01:07:03,061
You're daft. Tell him.

479
01:07:03,603 --> 01:07:04,813
Yeah.

480
01:07:08,191 --> 01:07:10,610
Tell me.

481
01:07:35,719 --> 01:07:36,970
Tell me, Gibson.

482
01:07:45,020 --> 01:07:46,021
Tell me!

483
01:07:47,105 --> 01:07:48,607
Tell him, for God's sake!

484
01:07:57,449 --> 01:07:59,076
A frog.

485
01:07:59,534 --> 01:08:01,078
A bloody frog.

486
01:08:01,828 --> 01:08:04,915
A cowardly little queue-jumping frog.

487
01:08:05,582 --> 01:08:06,958
Who is Gibson?

488
01:08:07,125 --> 01:08:09,586
Some naked, dead Englishman
lying out on that sand?

489
01:08:09,753 --> 01:08:11,797
Did you at least have the
decency to bury him?

490
01:08:12,005 --> 01:08:13,757
He did. I helped him.
I thought it was his mate.

491
01:08:13,965 --> 01:08:15,217
Maybe he killed him.
He didn't kill him.

492
01:08:15,383 --> 01:08:16,484
How do we know?

493
01:08:16,551 --> 01:08:19,070
How hard is it to find a dead
Englishman on Dunkirk beach?

494
01:08:19,137 --> 01:08:20,488
He didn't kill anyone.

495
01:08:20,555 --> 01:08:23,282
He was just looking for a way
off the sand, like the rest of us.

496
01:08:28,146 --> 01:08:29,956
Haven't they had enough
practice by now?

497
01:08:30,023 --> 01:08:32,125
They're trying to make
sure she won't float.

498
01:08:32,192 --> 01:08:33,693
Will she still float?

499
01:08:33,860 --> 01:08:35,654
Float, yes. Yes, with less weight.

500
01:08:37,322 --> 01:08:38,465
And we know who is getting off.

501
01:08:38,532 --> 01:08:40,659
No, you can't do that.
He is French. He's on our side.

502
01:08:40,826 --> 01:08:42,327
Go on. Up you go.

503
01:08:42,494 --> 01:08:44,846
As soon as he pokes his head
out, they'll slaughter him.

504
01:08:44,913 --> 01:08:46,264
Better him than me.

505
01:08:46,331 --> 01:08:47,499
It's not fair.

506
01:08:47,666 --> 01:08:49,059
Survival is not fair.

507
01:08:49,126 --> 01:08:50,527
No, it's shit.

508
01:08:51,002 --> 01:08:53,338
It's fear and it's greed.

509
01:08:53,505 --> 01:08:55,607
Fate pushed through
the bowels of men.

510
01:08:55,674 --> 01:08:56,875
Shit.

511
01:08:58,176 --> 01:08:59,527
He saved our lives.

512
01:08:59,594 --> 01:09:00,946
And he is about to do it again.

513
01:09:01,012 --> 01:09:02,555
No, don't! Stop!

514
01:09:03,390 --> 01:09:06,768
Somebody is gotta get off,
so the rest of us can live.

515
01:09:07,519 --> 01:09:08,662
If you wanna volunteer...

516
01:09:08,728 --> 01:09:09,896
Fuck no.

517
01:09:10,147 --> 01:09:11,548
I'm going home.

518
01:09:11,857 --> 01:09:13,483
And if this is the price?

519
01:09:18,446 --> 01:09:19,614
I'll live with it.

520
01:09:20,240 --> 01:09:21,541
But it's wrong.

521
01:09:22,033 --> 01:09:23,334
Go on!

522
01:09:25,120 --> 01:09:27,222
One man is not going to
make enough difference.

523
01:09:27,289 --> 01:09:29,974
You'd best hope it does because
you'd be volunteering next.

524
01:09:30,542 --> 01:09:32,043
What?

525
01:09:32,377 --> 01:09:34,496
We're regimental brothers, mate.

526
01:09:34,921 --> 01:09:36,598
It's just the way it is.

527
01:09:46,308 --> 01:09:47,984
We float.

528
01:09:48,393 --> 01:09:49,919
We float!

529
01:09:50,228 --> 01:09:51,813
Start the bloody engine!

530
01:10:30,185 --> 01:10:31,603
Afternoon.

531
01:11:26,950 --> 01:11:29,627
I'm sorry, son. I really don't know.

532
01:11:31,997 --> 01:11:34,148
You're right not moving him.

533
01:11:37,335 --> 01:11:39,537
You've done the best
for him you can.

534
01:11:50,932 --> 01:11:52,200
We've wasted the day.

535
01:11:52,267 --> 01:11:54,811
I share your frustration, Colonel.

536
01:11:55,854 --> 01:11:57,155
Johnny!

537
01:12:03,820 --> 01:12:05,839
Grounded trawler, taking fire.

538
01:12:05,905 --> 01:12:08,449
They're breaking through
the dunes to the east.

539
01:12:11,745 --> 01:12:13,163
This is it.

540
01:12:21,254 --> 01:12:22,439
Plug the holes!

541
01:12:22,505 --> 01:12:23,798
With what?

542
01:12:34,726 --> 01:12:36,603
Plug the holes!

543
01:12:38,355 --> 01:12:41,149
Other side! Other side!

544
01:13:30,949 --> 01:13:32,409
What do you see?

545
01:13:39,290 --> 01:13:40,625
Home.

546
01:15:35,198 --> 01:15:37,200
Is he all right? The boy?

547
01:15:39,202 --> 01:15:40,453
No.

548
01:15:40,620 --> 01:15:42,288
No, he is not.

549
01:15:53,716 --> 01:15:55,017
Dad!

550
01:16:02,600 --> 01:16:04,894
Come on, Farrier. Come on.

551
01:16:23,871 --> 01:16:25,456
There is men in the water.

552
01:17:10,793 --> 01:17:11,994
Oil.

553
01:17:13,254 --> 01:17:15,757
It's oil. Oil. You're getting into oil.

554
01:17:51,209 --> 01:17:52,669
Keep coming.

555
01:17:53,586 --> 01:17:55,004
Plenty of room.

556
01:18:00,051 --> 01:18:01,844
All right, below deck.

557
01:18:37,922 --> 01:18:39,799
Abandon ship!

558
01:19:02,071 --> 01:19:04,365
Gibson! Leave it!

559
01:19:47,366 --> 01:19:48,534
Below decks.

560
01:20:37,458 --> 01:20:39,627
Listen, we have to get as
many of you on board as we can

561
01:20:39,794 --> 01:20:41,020
before that oil catches fire.

562
01:20:41,087 --> 01:20:43,714
You go below decks or you get
off my boat. That's your choice.

563
01:20:46,634 --> 01:20:48,386
Keep coming.

564
01:20:49,720 --> 01:20:52,223
Whoa! Careful!
Careful down there.

565
01:20:52,390 --> 01:20:53,683
Careful. Careful down there!

566
01:20:55,726 --> 01:20:57,854
He is dead, mate.

567
01:21:02,441 --> 01:21:04,569
So be bloody careful with him.

568
01:21:26,591 --> 01:21:28,259
Will he be okay?

569
01:21:29,010 --> 01:21:30,394
The boy?

570
01:21:36,058 --> 01:21:37,359
Yeah.

571
01:23:00,810 --> 01:23:02,561
He is coming back round.

572
01:23:03,437 --> 01:23:04,730
He is coming back round.

573
01:23:10,611 --> 01:23:12,530
Come on, Farrier. Come on.

574
01:23:27,753 --> 01:23:29,005
Get off the ship!

575
01:23:45,187 --> 01:23:46,647
Come on, Farrier.
Get around them.

576
01:23:46,814 --> 01:23:48,107
Come on, come on.

577
01:24:44,789 --> 01:24:45,990
Go.

578
01:24:50,294 --> 01:24:51,595
Go! Go!

579
01:25:05,684 --> 01:25:07,069
Go!

580
01:25:40,553 --> 01:25:41,854
Easy.

581
01:25:46,684 --> 01:25:47,935
Take me home.

582
01:26:45,826 --> 01:26:47,119
Where are you from?

583
01:26:48,037 --> 01:26:49,830
Out of Dartmouth!

584
01:26:49,997 --> 01:26:51,248
Christ.

585
01:26:52,333 --> 01:26:53,667
You from Deal?

586
01:26:53,834 --> 01:26:55,294
I am.

587
01:26:55,461 --> 01:26:57,630
You watch the current at the mouth.

588
01:26:57,796 --> 01:26:58,897
Aye.

589
01:26:58,964 --> 01:27:00,449
And thank you.

590
01:27:49,848 --> 01:27:52,391
That's a fighter.
Yes, an Me 109.

591
01:27:52,393 --> 01:27:54,561
From the south.
Peter, you take the tiller.

592
01:27:54,561 --> 01:27:56,397
Listen for my instructions.

593
01:27:57,231 --> 01:27:58,440
Point her south!

594
01:28:11,078 --> 01:28:12,779
Full speed, Peter.

595
01:28:14,498 --> 01:28:16,058
Keep coming round.

596
01:28:16,125 --> 01:28:17,734
Keep coming.

597
01:28:18,669 --> 01:28:22,339
Before he fires, he's gotta drop
his nose. I'll give you the signal.

598
01:28:23,841 --> 01:28:25,450
Now?
No, no. Wait.

599
01:28:26,260 --> 01:28:28,304
Wait for him to commit to his line.

600
01:28:45,529 --> 01:28:46,872
Now!

601
01:29:24,777 --> 01:29:27,178
He is gone.
Yeah, bigger fish to fry.

602
01:29:27,404 --> 01:29:29,281
How'd you know
that stuff anyway?

603
01:29:29,698 --> 01:29:31,508
My son is one of you lot.

604
01:29:31,700 --> 01:29:33,410
I knew he'd see us through.

605
01:29:39,458 --> 01:29:41,259
You're RAF?

606
01:29:42,503 --> 01:29:44,380
No. Not me.

607
01:29:44,546 --> 01:29:47,883
My brother. He flew Hurricanes.

608
01:29:48,050 --> 01:29:50,035
Died third week into the war.

609
01:30:29,883 --> 01:30:31,969
No, stay downstairs, please.

610
01:30:32,594 --> 01:30:34,596
We just wanna see the cliffs.

611
01:30:41,520 --> 01:30:43,439
Is it Dover? No.

612
01:30:44,022 --> 01:30:45,441
That's Dorset.

613
01:30:46,024 --> 01:30:47,568
But it's home.

614
01:30:49,570 --> 01:30:52,030
We let you all down,
didn't we?

615
01:31:31,361 --> 01:31:34,239
Christ, how many you got in there?

616
01:31:52,257 --> 01:31:53,884
Make your way to the trains.

617
01:31:55,552 --> 01:31:57,137
Where the hell were you?

618
01:32:04,561 --> 01:32:06,271
They know where you were.

619
01:32:11,527 --> 01:32:12,828
Bye.

620
01:32:32,339 --> 01:32:33,715
Cup of tea?

621
01:32:35,634 --> 01:32:37,010
Cup of tea?

622
01:32:37,844 --> 01:32:40,597
Well done. Well done.

623
01:32:41,014 --> 01:32:42,140
Well done, lads.

624
01:32:42,307 --> 01:32:44,935
Well done. Well done, lads.

625
01:32:46,019 --> 01:32:47,604
Well done.

626
01:32:48,188 --> 01:32:49,856
All we did is survive.

627
01:32:50,524 --> 01:32:51,942
That's enough.

628
01:32:59,700 --> 01:33:00,701
Well done.

629
01:33:01,868 --> 01:33:03,161
Well done.

630
01:33:14,339 --> 01:33:17,300
That old bloke wouldn't
even look us in the eye.

631
01:33:37,154 --> 01:33:39,072
Come on, private!

632
01:33:39,990 --> 01:33:44,578
I know we're officers,
but it's us or the enemy.

633
01:33:45,662 --> 01:33:47,998
So now is not the time
to be particular.

634
01:33:51,627 --> 01:33:54,254
Well, Churchill got his 30,000.

635
01:33:54,421 --> 01:33:55,714
And then some.

636
01:33:56,590 --> 01:33:58,675
Almost 300,000.

637
01:34:02,095 --> 01:34:03,347
So far.

638
01:34:04,723 --> 01:34:05,766
So far?

639
01:34:06,308 --> 01:34:07,559
I'm staying.

640
01:34:08,727 --> 01:34:10,103
For the French.

641
01:35:03,740 --> 01:35:05,117
Hey!

642
01:35:05,283 --> 01:35:06,451
Where are we?

643
01:35:06,618 --> 01:35:09,413
Siding. You'll be pulling
in in a minute.

644
01:35:09,579 --> 01:35:11,039
What station?

645
01:35:11,206 --> 01:35:12,708
Woking.

646
01:35:13,333 --> 01:35:14,960
Grab me one of them papers.

647
01:35:15,210 --> 01:35:16,336
Go on!

648
01:35:30,183 --> 01:35:31,601
Can't bear it.

649
01:35:33,437 --> 01:35:34,604
You read it.

650
01:35:35,397 --> 01:35:36,798
Can't bear it?

651
01:35:37,023 --> 01:35:39,234
They'll be spitting at
us in the streets.

652
01:35:40,277 --> 01:35:43,113
If they're not locked up
waiting for the invasion.

653
01:36:29,659 --> 01:36:32,120
"Wars are not won by evacuations."

654
01:36:35,916 --> 01:36:37,250
I can't look.

655
01:36:37,626 --> 01:36:39,628
"But there was a victory
inside this deliverance,

656
01:36:39,795 --> 01:36:41,630
"which should be noted.

657
01:36:48,553 --> 01:36:50,514
"Our thankfulness at the
escape of our army

658

fact that what has happened

01:36:53,266 --> 01:36:56,853

a colossal military disaster.

660
01:37:14,412 --> 01:37:17,749
"We must expect another blow

01:37:42,357 --> 01:37:44,276
"We shall fight in France.

"We shall fight on the

"We shall fight with growing confidence

665
01:38:14,514 --> 01:38:16,099
"We shall defend our island

666
01:38:16,266 --> 01:38:17,367
What?

667
01:38:17,434 --> 01:38:20,520
"We shall defend our island
whatever the cost may be.

668
01:38:20,979 --> 01:38:23,023
