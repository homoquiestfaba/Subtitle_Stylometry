1
00:02:20,516 --> 00:02:22,309
This is the story...

2
00:02:22,309 --> 00:02:24,811
of how I almost lived
my entire adult life...

3
00:02:24,811 --> 00:02:26,813
in a functional coma...

4
00:02:26,813 --> 00:02:29,816
instead of becoming the writer
I always dreamed I'd be...

5
00:02:29,816 --> 00:02:32,819
like Sylvia Plath, only happy.

6
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:35,322
To be a writer
was my childhood dream...

7
00:02:35,322 --> 00:02:38,325
but like my childhood,
the dream was sweet...

8
00:02:38,325 --> 00:02:39,743
but mostly it was short.

9
00:02:39,743 --> 00:02:42,287
My parents died
in a car accident...

10
00:02:42,287 --> 00:02:44,831
leaving my sister
and me orphans.

11
00:02:44,831 --> 00:02:47,125
My sister acted
like a brat at the funeral...

12
00:02:47,125 --> 00:02:49,002
setting a life-Iong pattern...

13
00:02:49,002 --> 00:02:52,005
of always doing and saying
whatever she felt.

14
00:02:53,882 --> 00:02:58,053
As for me, the next twelve years
were very Ionely...

15
00:02:58,053 --> 00:02:59,346
until...

16
00:03:01,098 --> 00:03:03,892
With this ring,
I thee wed.

17
00:03:07,437 --> 00:03:11,441
His name was Harry Turner,
and we were in love.

18
00:03:11,441 --> 00:03:14,403
I thought everything
was going to be perfect...

19
00:03:14,403 --> 00:03:17,447
and it might have been,
except for one thing...

20
00:03:17,447 --> 00:03:20,409
Harry was already married
to someone else...

21
00:03:21,410 --> 00:03:23,453
his family.

22
00:03:23,453 --> 00:03:25,455
Harry joined
their medical practice...

23
00:03:25,455 --> 00:03:27,958
and although I had his hand
in holy matrimony...

24
00:03:27,958 --> 00:03:29,626
they had his shingle.

25
00:03:30,961 --> 00:03:34,423
Harry became a brilliant
gastroenterologist...

26
00:03:34,423 --> 00:03:37,301
who really knew his way
around an intestine.

27
00:03:37,301 --> 00:03:38,802
See this part here?

28
00:03:40,929 --> 00:03:43,015
To people on the outside...

29
00:03:43,015 --> 00:03:45,976
I'm sure it looked like
we had a happy life together...

30
00:03:45,976 --> 00:03:47,978
and for a while,
I thought we did, too.

31
00:03:47,978 --> 00:03:49,980
I mean, things
weren't exactly...

32
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:52,399
the way I would
have liked them...

33
00:03:52,399 --> 00:03:53,984
but I learned
to make compromises...

34
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:57,487
which is how we achieved
a balance in our marriage.

35
00:03:57,487 --> 00:03:59,448
The problem is...

36
00:03:59,448 --> 00:04:01,366
somewhere during
eight years of balancing...

37
00:04:01,366 --> 00:04:03,911
I stopped thinking
of myself as me.

38
00:04:03,911 --> 00:04:06,955
All I was was Harry's wife.

39
00:04:06,955 --> 00:04:08,415
Hi. How are you?

40
00:04:09,917 --> 00:04:13,629
We were one of those couples
who did everything together...

41
00:04:13,629 --> 00:04:15,464
except communicate.

42
00:04:38,445 --> 00:04:40,155
Good night, dear.

43
00:04:43,659 --> 00:04:46,703
You didn't want
to make love, did you?

44
00:04:46,703 --> 00:04:48,455
No, no. That's all right.

45
00:04:48,455 --> 00:04:49,915
Good.

46
00:04:49,915 --> 00:04:51,917
Sex wasn't everything,
but it was...

47
00:04:51,917 --> 00:04:54,920
one of the few things we did
without Harry's family.

48
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:58,715
So when that began to fade,
I should have said something...

49
00:04:58,715 --> 00:05:00,425
but I didn't know how.

50
00:05:01,885 --> 00:05:03,387
Harry, I thought I'd make...

51
00:05:03,387 --> 00:05:06,557
a nice, big pot roast
for your family tonight...

52
00:05:06,557 --> 00:05:07,891
or turkey.

53
00:05:07,891 --> 00:05:09,059
What do you think?

54
00:05:09,059 --> 00:05:10,561
Uh-huh.

55
00:05:10,561 --> 00:05:13,355
Harry, can you hear me?

56
00:05:13,355 --> 00:05:14,898
Mmm.

57
00:05:14,898 --> 00:05:15,899
Hello?

58
00:05:15,899 --> 00:05:18,026
Come on in, Iris.

59
00:05:18,026 --> 00:05:19,736
Your front door was open.

60
00:05:19,736 --> 00:05:20,779
I'm sorry.

61
00:05:20,779 --> 00:05:22,406
You want some coffee?

62
00:05:22,406 --> 00:05:23,907
Please.

63
00:05:23,907 --> 00:05:25,868
Marjorie? Coffee.

64
00:05:26,952 --> 00:05:28,161
I'll need some milk with that.

65
00:05:28,161 --> 00:05:29,705
With milk.

66
00:05:29,705 --> 00:05:31,206
What's this?

67
00:05:31,206 --> 00:05:33,208
"We love you loads,
Uncle Charles."

68
00:05:33,208 --> 00:05:35,127
The kids made it themselves.

69
00:05:35,127 --> 00:05:37,129
How can they love him loads?

70
00:05:37,129 --> 00:05:39,131
He left for Costa Rica
before they were born.

71
00:05:39,131 --> 00:05:41,925
I think they're just proud
to have an uncle...

72
00:05:41,925 --> 00:05:43,927
that helps so many people.

73
00:05:43,927 --> 00:05:45,512
All doctors help people.

74
00:05:45,512 --> 00:05:47,931
Charles travels all over
the world helping people.

75
00:05:47,931 --> 00:05:50,142
I don't think all doctors
do that, Harry.

76
00:05:50,142 --> 00:05:51,518
Here you go.

77
00:05:51,518 --> 00:05:53,770
Just like you like it...
with one splash.

78
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:55,606
Low-fat.

79
00:05:55,606 --> 00:05:58,525
There's no problem.
Low-fat.

80
00:05:58,525 --> 00:06:01,111
Anyway, the kids
can't wait to meet him.

81
00:06:01,111 --> 00:06:02,738
I can't, either.

82
00:06:02,738 --> 00:06:04,615
It's so weird having
a brother-in-law...

83
00:06:04,615 --> 00:06:06,158
that I don't even know.

84
00:06:06,158 --> 00:06:07,993
It's weirder having
a brother you don't know.

85
00:06:07,993 --> 00:06:10,120
What's that supposed to mean?

86
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:13,582
My own brother sends me
one letter in fifteen years.

87
00:06:13,582 --> 00:06:15,959
When you're off winning
the Nobel Peace Prize...

88
00:06:15,959 --> 00:06:17,628
you can't be expected to write
a bunch of letters.

89
00:06:17,628 --> 00:06:19,296
Did Charles win
a Nobel Peace Prize?

90
00:06:19,296 --> 00:06:21,215
He didn't win.
He was just nominated.

91
00:06:21,215 --> 00:06:22,841
Why do you do this?

92
00:06:22,841 --> 00:06:25,177
Do you think he'll like me?

93
00:06:25,177 --> 00:06:28,472
Of course he'll like you.
You're Harry's wife.

94
00:06:28,472 --> 00:06:29,806
Here you go. Low-fat.

95
00:06:29,806 --> 00:06:33,477
Too late. Gotta go.
Got a C-section at 9:00.

96
00:06:33,477 --> 00:06:36,480
And I've got a polyp at 9:30.

97
00:06:42,486 --> 00:06:44,488
Hiya, doll.
How's my sweetheart?

98
00:06:44,488 --> 00:06:46,990
Tired. Haven't seen you
in a while, Nick.

99
00:06:46,990 --> 00:06:48,492
You been busy?

100
00:06:48,492 --> 00:06:49,993
Yeah. Busy, busy, busy.

101
00:06:49,993 --> 00:06:51,995
Having lunch
with my brother today.

102
00:06:51,995 --> 00:06:53,497
He's here.

103
00:06:53,497 --> 00:06:54,665
Good.

104
00:06:54,665 --> 00:06:56,166
How's the fish fry?

105
00:06:56,166 --> 00:06:57,960
I wouldn't eat it, honey.

106
00:06:59,962 --> 00:07:02,422
Hey, Wilbur!

107
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:04,049
I hear the fish fry
is no good...

108
00:07:04,049 --> 00:07:06,844
but I got a feeling
about the meat loaf.

109
00:07:08,971 --> 00:07:10,681
Your landlord called me today.

110
00:07:10,681 --> 00:07:13,308
You haven't paid your rent
in four months.

111
00:07:13,308 --> 00:07:15,894
Your landlord says
you owe $1,200 back rent.

112
00:07:15,894 --> 00:07:17,354
I know.

113
00:07:17,354 --> 00:07:19,523
And I'm going to go
over to his office...

114
00:07:19,523 --> 00:07:21,066
after this lunch...

115
00:07:21,066 --> 00:07:23,026
and pay him part
of what I owe him...

116
00:07:23,026 --> 00:07:24,862
as a good faith kind of thing.

117
00:07:24,862 --> 00:07:27,030
Good. How much you
going to give him?

118
00:07:27,030 --> 00:07:28,282
$200.

119
00:07:28,282 --> 00:07:30,701
Where are you going
to get the money?

120
00:07:30,701 --> 00:07:32,202
Can you loan me 200 bucks?

121
00:07:32,202 --> 00:07:35,372
No, just until I close this
big deal that I'm working on.

122
00:07:35,372 --> 00:07:36,707
All right, Nick, look...

123
00:07:36,707 --> 00:07:39,209
I'll tell you what
I'm going to do.

124
00:07:39,209 --> 00:07:41,503
I'm going to lend you
the whole $1,200.

125
00:07:41,503 --> 00:07:44,047
Oh, no, no. Wilbur,
I can't take that much!

126
00:07:44,047 --> 00:07:46,675
Nick, you know I'm up
for chief of police.

127
00:07:46,675 --> 00:07:48,760
I know.
I can't believe it.

128
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:50,762
But this kind of thing...

129
00:07:50,762 --> 00:07:52,848
could really hurt
my chances, Nick.

130
00:07:52,848 --> 00:07:54,683
You know, my brother
getting evicted...

131
00:07:54,683 --> 00:07:56,393
for not paying his rent.

132
00:07:56,393 --> 00:07:58,145
Right.

133
00:07:58,145 --> 00:07:59,980
I'm under
a magnifying glass, Nick.

134
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:01,899
I got to get appointed
by the mayor.

135
00:08:01,899 --> 00:08:04,401
You get to meet the mayor?

136
00:08:04,401 --> 00:08:07,613
It's all public.
You could blow this for me.

137
00:08:07,613 --> 00:08:10,365
You deserve
to be chief of police...

138
00:08:10,365 --> 00:08:14,369
and I'm going to do everything
I can do to help, and...

139
00:08:14,369 --> 00:08:17,164
because we're brothers, and...

140
00:08:18,373 --> 00:08:19,875
I love you.

141
00:08:19,875 --> 00:08:21,877
I love you,
I love you,

142
00:08:21,877 --> 00:08:23,754
I love you,
I love you!

143
00:08:24,963 --> 00:08:27,216
Yeah. You wanted to see me, Pat?

144
00:08:27,216 --> 00:08:29,092
Shut the door.

145
00:08:33,222 --> 00:08:35,891
You've been working for me
for three months today...

146
00:08:35,891 --> 00:08:38,393
and you haven't sold
one set of blinds.

147
00:08:38,393 --> 00:08:39,520
Can I sit down here?

148
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:40,729
No.

149
00:08:40,729 --> 00:08:42,648
Uh...

150
00:08:42,648 --> 00:08:44,107
Face it, Nick...

151
00:08:45,359 --> 00:08:47,194
You're just not a salesman.

152
00:08:47,194 --> 00:08:49,488
Oh, Pat, don't say that.

153
00:08:49,488 --> 00:08:51,698
You're hurting me.

154
00:08:51,698 --> 00:08:53,200
I gotta let you go.

155
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,993
No, Pat. No. Not yet!

156
00:08:54,993 --> 00:08:58,914
You see, I...
I've got an appointment here...

157
00:08:58,914 --> 00:09:01,083
and I'm going down now to...

158
00:09:01,083 --> 00:09:02,835
I'm going to the Sheraton.

159
00:09:02,835 --> 00:09:04,419
The Sheraton?

160
00:09:04,419 --> 00:09:07,756
Yeah. I am going to put
an A-1 Acme vertical blind...

161
00:09:07,756 --> 00:09:10,300
in every window in every room
in that hotel.

162
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:11,844
But the Sheraton's got drapes.

163
00:09:13,804 --> 00:09:15,931
Exactly.

164
00:09:20,978 --> 00:09:22,980
Hi, J.

165
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:24,481
Hi. What's wrong?

166
00:09:24,481 --> 00:09:27,985
Nothing. I just came by
to drop these off.

167
00:09:27,985 --> 00:09:29,653
Why?

168
00:09:29,653 --> 00:09:31,655
Because I thought
this would be...

169
00:09:31,655 --> 00:09:34,241
a real good opportunity
for you to think about...

170
00:09:34,241 --> 00:09:35,826
going to community college.

171
00:09:35,826 --> 00:09:37,828
What are you,
my career counselor?

172
00:09:37,828 --> 00:09:39,997
No. I'm your sister.

173
00:09:39,997 --> 00:09:42,499
Jeanine, I just think...

174
00:09:42,499 --> 00:09:44,501
that you can do
better than this.

175
00:09:44,501 --> 00:09:46,587
I like fish.

176
00:09:46,587 --> 00:09:48,797
Of course you like fish, because
you don't have to have...

177
00:09:48,797 --> 00:09:50,299
a real relationship
with a fish.

178
00:09:50,299 --> 00:09:53,510
I think you are
very, very unhappy...

179
00:09:53,510 --> 00:09:55,429
and I'm glad we're
talking about it...

180
00:09:55,429 --> 00:09:58,432
because I think you have a lot
of feelings bottled up inside.

181
00:09:58,432 --> 00:10:00,017
What are you talking about?

182
00:10:00,017 --> 00:10:01,518
Does Harry go down on you?

183
00:10:03,478 --> 00:10:04,855
I didn't think so.

184
00:10:04,855 --> 00:10:07,065
Please do not
talk to me like this.

185
00:10:07,065 --> 00:10:10,819
I bet you've never come
even once in your life.

186
00:10:10,819 --> 00:10:13,530
You just... Get back here,
young lady.

187
00:10:13,530 --> 00:10:14,990
Listen to me.

188
00:10:14,990 --> 00:10:17,367
This is why you don't
have a relationship!

189
00:10:17,367 --> 00:10:18,827
What?

190
00:10:18,827 --> 00:10:21,413
This... that... because you are
so forward.

191
00:10:21,413 --> 00:10:23,457
I'm not forward.
I'm honest.

192
00:10:23,457 --> 00:10:25,000
Is that what you call it?

193
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,545
Is that why you're single,
making minimum wage?

194
00:10:28,545 --> 00:10:30,923
I don't want a relationship.
I'm independent.

195
00:10:30,923 --> 00:10:32,549
And as a matter of fact...

196
00:10:32,549 --> 00:10:34,218
I have had
quite a few relationships.

197
00:10:34,218 --> 00:10:36,136
No. To qualify
as a relationship...

198
00:10:36,136 --> 00:10:38,096
it has to last
longer than 24 hours!

199
00:10:38,096 --> 00:10:40,933
At least I didn't marry
the first guy who felt me up.

200
00:10:40,933 --> 00:10:43,435
He isn't the first guy who...
I had some...

201
00:10:43,435 --> 00:10:45,521
Could you grab those, please?

202
00:10:52,069 --> 00:10:53,570
Do you love Harry?

203
00:10:53,570 --> 00:10:56,698
Yes, I love Harry.
He is my husband.

204
00:10:57,741 --> 00:11:00,244
Why don't you like him?

205
00:11:00,244 --> 00:11:01,703
I like him.

206
00:11:01,703 --> 00:11:04,706
It's just that his whole family
treats me like street scum.

207
00:11:04,706 --> 00:11:06,542
They have never used
that exact term.

208
00:11:06,542 --> 00:11:07,960
Ever since you met this guy...

209
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:09,878
your life got wrapped up
into this neat little package.

210
00:11:09,878 --> 00:11:12,923
You even stopped writing.
You used to love to write.

211
00:11:12,923 --> 00:11:14,925
That was a long time ago.

212
00:11:14,925 --> 00:11:16,468
And I never was a real writer.

213
00:11:17,469 --> 00:11:19,429
You wrote short stories.

214
00:11:19,429 --> 00:11:21,098
Those weren't short stories.
Those were novels.

215
00:11:21,098 --> 00:11:22,808
I just never finished them.

216
00:11:22,808 --> 00:11:26,270
You started them a lot,
and since you got married...

217
00:11:26,270 --> 00:11:28,021
you stopped even starting them.

218
00:11:28,021 --> 00:11:29,481
This is ridiculous.

219
00:11:29,481 --> 00:11:32,442
I know you were a virgin
when you got married.

220
00:11:35,654 --> 00:11:38,490
Don't you ever wonder
if Harry's doing it right?

221
00:11:38,490 --> 00:11:40,450
Harry is doing it fine!

222
00:11:40,450 --> 00:11:42,870
And even if he weren't,
it's none of your business.

223
00:11:42,870 --> 00:11:46,790
You know what you should do?
You should have an affair.

224
00:11:46,790 --> 00:11:48,041
What?

225
00:11:48,041 --> 00:11:50,252
Then at least you'd have
some frame of reference.

226
00:11:50,252 --> 00:11:51,962
Do you know something?

227
00:11:51,962 --> 00:11:54,131
I have spent
most of my life...

228
00:11:54,131 --> 00:11:56,300
pretending like
you are retarded...

229
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:59,928
just so I can stand
being related to you!

230
00:12:10,439 --> 00:12:12,274
You dented your cheese.

231
00:12:20,449 --> 00:12:22,492
Is this checkout line closed?

232
00:12:22,492 --> 00:12:25,954
No. The cashier just went to get
my credit card approved.

233
00:12:25,954 --> 00:12:29,541
She's going to let you use
a credit card to buy just that?

234
00:12:29,541 --> 00:12:32,336
No. I'm buying one of those
fruit baskets over there.

235
00:12:32,336 --> 00:12:34,129
This goes with that.

236
00:12:35,631 --> 00:12:37,382
What do you think?

237
00:12:37,382 --> 00:12:39,635
People really like
those kind of things?

238
00:12:41,011 --> 00:12:42,721
I don't know.
I suppose so.

239
00:12:42,721 --> 00:12:43,972
Would you like it?

240
00:12:43,972 --> 00:12:47,935
I don't know!
Sorry.

241
00:12:47,935 --> 00:12:51,104
You could use your anger
in a more productive way.

242
00:12:53,148 --> 00:12:54,525
How's that?

243
00:12:54,525 --> 00:12:57,361
You could help me
write this card.

244
00:12:57,361 --> 00:12:59,530
It might calm you down.

245
00:13:02,908 --> 00:13:04,409
What's the present for?

246
00:13:04,409 --> 00:13:05,911
A party.

247
00:13:05,911 --> 00:13:08,413
But I'm having second thoughts
about going.

248
00:13:10,457 --> 00:13:12,876
OK. Everything's ready.
Your order's in.

249
00:13:14,378 --> 00:13:16,964
Let's see...
I got the address.

250
00:13:16,964 --> 00:13:19,466
They're making up your basket
in the back...

251
00:13:19,466 --> 00:13:21,927
and we'll send it out
as soon as it's done.

252
00:13:21,927 --> 00:13:23,887
OK. Thanks.

253
00:13:23,887 --> 00:13:25,430
You done with that card yet?

254
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:28,559
Not yet.
I was just getting some help.

255
00:13:31,645 --> 00:13:33,939
What do you say?

256
00:13:33,939 --> 00:13:37,359
So then you don't really
want to go to this party?

257
00:13:37,359 --> 00:13:38,944
No, not really.

258
00:13:38,944 --> 00:13:40,571
I feel obligated, but...

259
00:13:43,448 --> 00:13:45,284
Tell them to start without you.

260
00:13:46,577 --> 00:13:47,703
OK.

261
00:13:52,457 --> 00:13:54,334
That way, you know...

262
00:13:55,836 --> 00:13:59,631
You could go late,
if you wanted to.

263
00:14:07,431 --> 00:14:09,433
Chardonnay.
Bourbon and soda.

264
00:14:09,433 --> 00:14:10,767
Enjoy.

265
00:14:17,941 --> 00:14:20,110
Why were you so angry?

266
00:14:21,111 --> 00:14:22,613
I was just upset.

267
00:14:22,613 --> 00:14:24,615
Somebody upset me... my sister.

268
00:14:24,615 --> 00:14:26,950
You shouldn't
let her bother you.

269
00:14:26,950 --> 00:14:31,914
She thinks that I need to...
improve myself.

270
00:14:31,914 --> 00:14:36,960
You shouldn't pay so much
attention to your family.

271
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:39,838
Anyone can see that
you don't need improvement.

272
00:14:39,838 --> 00:14:42,132
You don't know me.

273
00:14:43,467 --> 00:14:45,469
Not that I don't appreciate...

274
00:14:45,469 --> 00:14:47,638
that you think
that I don't need any.

275
00:14:51,975 --> 00:14:54,019
I like you
much better this way.

276
00:14:54,019 --> 00:14:56,480
How's that?

277
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:58,649
You're in a good mood now.

278
00:15:00,317 --> 00:15:03,403
I think you put me
in a good mood.

279
00:15:03,403 --> 00:15:04,988
How'd I do that?

280
00:15:04,988 --> 00:15:06,532
I don't know.

281
00:15:06,532 --> 00:15:09,409
I guess it's nice
to just, you know...

282
00:15:09,409 --> 00:15:13,455
be able to just be myself.

283
00:15:13,455 --> 00:15:15,457
Instead of?

284
00:15:15,457 --> 00:15:17,459
Instead of what
I'm supposed to be.

285
00:15:19,044 --> 00:15:22,548
- You know, good.
- Oops!

286
00:15:22,548 --> 00:15:24,383
Oh... I'm Sorry.

287
00:15:24,383 --> 00:15:27,010
What does that mean...
Good?

288
00:15:27,010 --> 00:15:30,472
Sometimes people just think...

289
00:15:30,472 --> 00:15:34,685
that you're always supposed
to act one certain way.

290
00:15:34,685 --> 00:15:38,689
And that can just get
sort of tiring.

291
00:15:38,689 --> 00:15:40,399
You're being good now?

292
00:15:46,655 --> 00:15:47,906
I'm not.

293
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:52,911
I don't even know you...

294
00:15:52,911 --> 00:15:55,706
And I never talk to strangers.

295
00:16:02,713 --> 00:16:04,882
Are you always good?

296
00:16:04,882 --> 00:16:07,593
Yeah, pretty much.
I try to be.

297
00:16:07,593 --> 00:16:09,720
Did you ever try not to be?

298
00:16:13,390 --> 00:16:16,393
I don't think anybody
would recognize me.

299
00:16:20,397 --> 00:16:24,318
I don't think people
would really like it if...

300
00:16:24,318 --> 00:16:29,907
if I wasn't being...
the person that they think I am.

301
00:16:29,907 --> 00:16:35,287
So you're protecting everyone
from this other side you have.

302
00:16:36,663 --> 00:16:39,082
Must be a pretty
dangerous side.

303
00:16:43,253 --> 00:16:45,255
You been hiding yourself
for a long time?

304
00:16:47,424 --> 00:16:51,011
As long as I can remember.

305
00:16:51,011 --> 00:16:54,973
I bet it would be real nice
to let the real you out.

306
00:16:57,100 --> 00:17:01,355
I don't even know
if I know how to do that.

307
00:17:03,857 --> 00:17:05,275
Do you?

308
00:17:15,327 --> 00:17:18,789
My, my, my Aunt Jemimah!

309
00:17:20,749 --> 00:17:23,961
Sweet, sweet...

310
00:17:23,961 --> 00:17:26,880
This is delightful.

311
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:31,134
Oh, my god,
you are truly gifted!

312
00:17:31,134 --> 00:17:33,804
What is that you're doing?

313
00:17:33,804 --> 00:17:37,975
That's good!
That's very good.

314
00:17:37,975 --> 00:17:41,979
This is very pleasurable!

315
00:17:41,979 --> 00:17:43,939
Ina gadda davida!

316
00:17:47,276 --> 00:17:49,403
Are you a jogger?

317
00:17:49,403 --> 00:17:51,113
I can't take any more.

318
00:17:51,113 --> 00:17:53,240
God! Whoa, whoa!

319
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:55,242
Jesus!

320
00:17:55,242 --> 00:17:56,743
Just take me...

321
00:17:56,743 --> 00:17:58,245
This is so...

322
00:17:58,245 --> 00:17:59,580
I can't take it anymore.

323
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:00,831
Yes, I can. I can.

324
00:18:00,831 --> 00:18:02,916
Just give it to me.
OK, just...

325
00:18:02,916 --> 00:18:12,342
Oh, god, rock and roll!

326
00:18:12,342 --> 00:18:14,845
Is this all the mail
from yesterday?

327
00:18:14,845 --> 00:18:16,847
Yes. I believe that'll be it.

328
00:18:16,847 --> 00:18:18,807
I'll take care of it.

329
00:18:22,352 --> 00:18:24,897
Hi, Don.
How's it going?

330
00:18:24,897 --> 00:18:28,650
Mr. Diamond doesn't want
vertical blinds, Nick.

331
00:18:28,650 --> 00:18:32,404
Mr. Diamond hasn't seen
my vertical blinds.

332
00:18:32,404 --> 00:18:36,408
And because you and I are
old friends from high school...

333
00:18:36,408 --> 00:18:38,452
I thought that
I'd give your boss...

334
00:18:38,452 --> 00:18:40,913
first peek at the new line...

335
00:18:40,913 --> 00:18:43,999
before I brought them
across town to the Hyatt.

336
00:18:43,999 --> 00:18:45,542
There's no way, Nick.

337
00:18:45,542 --> 00:18:47,669
There is a way, Donnie.

338
00:18:47,669 --> 00:18:50,923
If I can hang them
in one of the rooms...

339
00:18:50,923 --> 00:18:55,469
if Mr. Diamond can see
what they do for a window...

340
00:18:55,469 --> 00:18:57,679
they sell themselves.

341
00:18:58,931 --> 00:19:01,642
They sell themselves.

342
00:19:04,895 --> 00:19:08,565
I think I just made up
for the last eight years.

343
00:19:08,565 --> 00:19:10,651
I don't know your name...

344
00:19:10,651 --> 00:19:13,904
and you don't know my name,
and that's good...

345
00:19:13,904 --> 00:19:17,908
because this
can never happen again.

346
00:19:17,908 --> 00:19:24,706
I hope it does...
but with my husband, not you.

347
00:19:24,706 --> 00:19:26,375
I never had an...

348
00:19:27,918 --> 00:19:32,130
I always knew
that I had it in me.

349
00:19:33,924 --> 00:19:36,885
You just made me feel so...

350
00:19:39,930 --> 00:19:42,599
Whatever you did was just so...

351
00:19:47,437 --> 00:19:49,439
We've got to get up.

352
00:19:49,439 --> 00:19:51,233
I have to go.

353
00:19:53,944 --> 00:19:56,780
You going to wake up,
sleepy head?

354
00:19:59,074 --> 00:20:00,534
Come on. Get up.

355
00:20:34,526 --> 00:20:35,736
Oh, god!

356
00:20:38,488 --> 00:20:40,115
404...

357
00:20:40,115 --> 00:20:41,575
401.

358
00:20:54,004 --> 00:20:55,464
All right.

359
00:20:59,009 --> 00:21:00,969
Wrong key.

360
00:21:06,892 --> 00:21:08,727
Oh, jeez!

361
00:21:08,727 --> 00:21:10,437
This is my fault.
I'm sorry.

362
00:21:10,437 --> 00:21:12,147
I'll get that.

363
00:21:12,147 --> 00:21:13,941
I'm sorry. I'm fine.

364
00:21:13,941 --> 00:21:15,901
No. Wait.

365
00:21:15,901 --> 00:21:17,945
I don't believe this happened.

366
00:21:17,945 --> 00:21:19,947
Look, here's your...

367
00:21:19,947 --> 00:21:21,156
Here's your... things.

368
00:21:21,156 --> 00:21:23,450
Thank you very much.
I'm sorry.

369
00:21:23,450 --> 00:21:24,952
Your personal...

370
00:21:24,952 --> 00:21:26,745
Yep!

371
00:21:26,745 --> 00:21:28,455
Yeah.

372
00:21:28,455 --> 00:21:29,456
Oh, boy!

373
00:21:29,456 --> 00:21:32,960
I can't believe this day!

374
00:21:35,587 --> 00:21:37,756
The wallet!

375
00:21:42,761 --> 00:21:45,222
Got to give it to Donnie.

376
00:21:50,561 --> 00:21:52,062
Wait a minute.

377
00:22:05,409 --> 00:22:08,370
Your... door's open.

378
00:22:42,613 --> 00:22:45,949
I see you put up the sign.
Thanks, Harry.

379
00:22:45,949 --> 00:22:47,451
Where have you been?

380
00:22:47,451 --> 00:22:50,454
I've been...
I've been with my...

381
00:22:50,454 --> 00:22:51,788
my sister.

382
00:22:51,788 --> 00:22:53,624
What were you doing
with your sister?

383
00:22:53,624 --> 00:22:55,334
You've got a dinner to cook.

384
00:22:55,334 --> 00:22:57,127
I know that!

385
00:22:57,127 --> 00:22:59,129
I have to take a shower.

386
00:22:59,129 --> 00:23:00,881
Isn't your sister coming
to help you?

387
00:23:00,881 --> 00:23:03,467
No.
Yes, she's coming.

388
00:23:03,467 --> 00:23:05,928
Of course she's coming.
Why wouldn't she come?

389
00:23:14,061 --> 00:23:16,563
I'm a sinner!

390
00:23:16,563 --> 00:23:18,524
I'm a killer sinner.

391
00:23:18,524 --> 00:23:20,317
I'm a sinful killer!

392
00:23:20,317 --> 00:23:24,071
Oh, god!
Forgive me, please!

393
00:23:24,071 --> 00:23:25,364
Forgive me.

394
00:23:30,410 --> 00:23:32,496
9-1-1-1.

395
00:23:32,496 --> 00:23:33,914
No, not...

396
00:23:34,998 --> 00:23:36,750
9-1-1.

397
00:23:40,921 --> 00:23:42,506
Hello!

398
00:23:44,591 --> 00:23:47,094
I'd like to make
an anonymous report.

399
00:23:47,094 --> 00:23:49,429
Is that OK?

400
00:23:49,429 --> 00:23:51,849
Yes, please.

401
00:23:53,934 --> 00:23:56,019
I just thought
you should know...

402
00:23:56,019 --> 00:23:59,439
that there is
a dead man in room 402...

403
00:23:59,439 --> 00:24:01,817
at the Summit Bluff Sheraton.

404
00:24:01,817 --> 00:24:04,027
Did you get all that?

405
00:24:04,027 --> 00:24:05,863
Yeah, I got it.

406
00:24:05,863 --> 00:24:07,155
Good.

407
00:24:08,532 --> 00:24:11,034
Ma'am? Hello?

408
00:24:11,034 --> 00:24:14,955
Ma'am, hello?

409
00:24:17,875 --> 00:24:20,377
Summit Bluff Sheraton.
May I help you?

410
00:24:20,377 --> 00:24:23,922
This is Officer Rodriguez
with the Summit Bluff police.

411
00:24:23,922 --> 00:24:25,549
Let me talk to hotel security.

412
00:24:33,891 --> 00:24:37,895
Mr. Diamond, the elegant choice
for the Nineties.

413
00:24:39,396 --> 00:24:40,814
That's one.

414
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:44,526
Anybody in there?

415
00:24:44,526 --> 00:24:46,320
Wait!

416
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:47,905
Don't open the door!

417
00:24:47,905 --> 00:24:50,407
Sorry. I'm just
getting undressed.

418
00:24:50,407 --> 00:24:53,535
Hotel security.
Everything OK in there?

419
00:24:53,535 --> 00:24:57,247
Yes. Everything's fine.

420
00:24:57,247 --> 00:25:00,876
I'm here alone,
and nothing's wrong.

421
00:25:00,876 --> 00:25:04,546
I got a call about some trouble
in this room.

422
00:25:06,089 --> 00:25:09,968
I didn't call.
Haven't used the phone, so...

423
00:25:09,968 --> 00:25:11,553
There's no trouble here.

424
00:25:11,553 --> 00:25:13,055
OK.

425
00:25:13,055 --> 00:25:14,806
Sorry to bother you.

426
00:25:14,806 --> 00:25:17,559
Don't worry about it.

427
00:25:19,686 --> 00:25:21,271
All right.

428
00:25:21,271 --> 00:25:22,814
OK.

429
00:25:26,902 --> 00:25:28,612
That's one.

430
00:25:54,429 --> 00:25:55,973
The bracket...

431
00:25:59,601 --> 00:26:01,645
Darn it, bracket!

432
00:26:09,695 --> 00:26:11,154
Stuck.

433
00:26:20,873 --> 00:26:23,041
Oh, my god!
I'm sorry!

434
00:26:23,041 --> 00:26:25,085
I didn't know you were asleep.

435
00:26:25,085 --> 00:26:26,503
Oh... blood!

436
00:26:28,881 --> 00:26:30,424
Oh! Oh, boy!

437
00:26:30,424 --> 00:26:31,967
You've been hurt!

438
00:26:31,967 --> 00:26:34,094
All right. All right.
Just relax! Relax.

439
00:26:35,888 --> 00:26:37,472
Hello?

440
00:26:38,724 --> 00:26:40,559
Hello!

441
00:26:40,559 --> 00:26:42,728
Oh, my god.
Oh, my god!

442
00:26:42,728 --> 00:26:44,813
Oh... oh, My g...

443
00:26:44,813 --> 00:26:47,649
Pulse. Pulse. Come on!

444
00:26:53,906 --> 00:26:57,326
He's dead.

445
00:26:57,326 --> 00:26:59,620
He's definitely...

446
00:26:59,620 --> 00:27:01,121
He's definitely dead.

447
00:27:02,372 --> 00:27:05,417
This isn't good.

448
00:27:05,417 --> 00:27:09,421
This definitely isn't good.

449
00:27:09,421 --> 00:27:10,923
Look...

450
00:27:10,923 --> 00:27:13,425
What am I going to do?

451
00:27:13,425 --> 00:27:16,428
I'll call the...

452
00:27:16,428 --> 00:27:21,433
No, I guess I'll go to the desk
and tell them that...

453
00:27:21,433 --> 00:27:23,936
I can't believe it!

454
00:27:23,936 --> 00:27:29,441
Wait. Donnie won't like this.
Donnie won't like this.

455
00:27:29,441 --> 00:27:33,195
I'll call...
I'll call...

456
00:27:33,195 --> 00:27:35,739
I don't know who to call.

457
00:27:37,574 --> 00:27:40,244
I remember this day.

458
00:27:40,244 --> 00:27:42,579
I tried so hard not to cry.

459
00:27:42,579 --> 00:27:46,083
I was so proud
of our new little Dr. Charles.

460
00:27:46,083 --> 00:27:49,795
Charles Junior was
a very fine-Iooking young man!

461
00:27:49,795 --> 00:27:53,090
I never realized how much
he looks like me.

462
00:27:53,090 --> 00:27:55,259
Look at me.
Was I ever really that cute?

463
00:27:55,259 --> 00:27:58,095
You must have been.
Look at you now.

464
00:27:58,095 --> 00:28:00,430
Why wasn't I in this picture?

465
00:28:00,430 --> 00:28:03,892
I think you were sick.
You were always getting sick.

466
00:28:08,522 --> 00:28:09,523
Not me.

467
00:28:09,523 --> 00:28:10,941
It's not me.

468
00:28:10,941 --> 00:28:12,025
Not me.

469
00:28:12,025 --> 00:28:13,277
It's never me.

470
00:28:13,277 --> 00:28:14,778
It's me.

471
00:28:14,778 --> 00:28:17,239
Honey, why don't you tell them
about your urethra.

472
00:28:18,907 --> 00:28:21,493
I had to dilate
a urethra today...

473
00:28:21,493 --> 00:28:23,287
One millimeter.

474
00:28:27,583 --> 00:28:29,209
Here's your radishes.

475
00:28:36,550 --> 00:28:37,843
Hello?

476
00:28:37,843 --> 00:28:40,012
Hello.

477
00:28:40,012 --> 00:28:42,973
May I speak
to Marjorie Turner, please?

478
00:28:42,973 --> 00:28:44,892
This is she.

479
00:28:44,892 --> 00:28:49,188
Yes. You don't know me,
but I have some bad news...

480
00:28:49,188 --> 00:28:50,647
about your husband.

481
00:28:52,733 --> 00:28:55,527
Your husband
has had an accident.

482
00:29:00,449 --> 00:29:03,118
Hello? Hello? Hello?

483
00:29:04,661 --> 00:29:06,747
Who was that?

484
00:29:06,747 --> 00:29:08,040
Prank call.

485
00:29:14,379 --> 00:29:15,839
Hello?

486
00:29:15,839 --> 00:29:17,883
Mrs. Turner...

487
00:29:17,883 --> 00:29:21,678
your husband's had an accident
in his hotel room.

488
00:29:21,678 --> 00:29:23,388
Who is this?

489
00:29:23,388 --> 00:29:29,436
Mrs. Turner, he's had
a very severe accident.

490
00:29:30,854 --> 00:29:32,356
You have the wrong number.

491
00:29:32,356 --> 00:29:33,482
No, I don't.

492
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:37,361
Who was it?
A breather?

493
00:29:38,403 --> 00:29:39,655
Sort of.

494
00:29:51,917 --> 00:29:53,418
What?

495
00:29:53,418 --> 00:29:55,420
Mrs. Turner,
this isn't a joke.

496
00:29:55,420 --> 00:29:57,506
So please don't hang up on me.

497
00:29:57,506 --> 00:29:59,508
How do you know my name?

498
00:29:59,508 --> 00:30:01,760
And where did you get
this phone number?

499
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:08,225
I found your wallet
here in the hallway...

500
00:30:08,225 --> 00:30:10,143
and I have it in the hotel.

501
00:30:13,814 --> 00:30:15,315
Thank you so much.

502
00:30:15,315 --> 00:30:18,110
Let me just go check.
I'll be right with you.

503
00:30:26,952 --> 00:30:28,912
Darn it.

504
00:30:28,912 --> 00:30:30,914
You are correct.

505
00:30:30,914 --> 00:30:32,791
Mrs. Turner...

506
00:30:34,251 --> 00:30:36,420
I think your husband is dead.

507
00:30:36,420 --> 00:30:39,715
Listen to me.
I need that wallet.

508
00:30:41,008 --> 00:30:43,051
What about your husband?

509
00:30:43,051 --> 00:30:45,012
Listen to me.
Just stay put.

510
00:30:45,012 --> 00:30:47,097
I will meet you there
in 20 minutes.

511
00:30:47,097 --> 00:30:49,099
And don't call anyone
until I get there.

512
00:30:53,979 --> 00:30:55,522
Stay here.

513
00:31:01,111 --> 00:31:02,446
Who was that?

514
00:31:02,446 --> 00:31:03,780
I have to go out a minute.

515
00:31:05,115 --> 00:31:06,074
Where?

516
00:31:06,074 --> 00:31:08,619
Somebody found my wallet.

517
00:31:08,619 --> 00:31:12,164
They're at the grocery store
waiting to pick it...

518
00:31:12,164 --> 00:31:14,082
Would you get that, please?

519
00:31:14,082 --> 00:31:15,626
You can't go now!

520
00:31:15,626 --> 00:31:16,960
I have to!

521
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:19,129
It's got my license in it.
It has all my credit cards.

522
00:31:19,129 --> 00:31:21,131
It has everything,
and they want me to come.

523
00:31:21,131 --> 00:31:22,716
What about dinner?

524
00:31:25,135 --> 00:31:26,803
You cook.

525
00:31:26,803 --> 00:31:29,097
I don't cook.
I reheat.

526
00:31:29,097 --> 00:31:30,974
Oh, god.
All right, I'll start.

527
00:31:30,974 --> 00:31:33,560
You get over here.

528
00:31:34,561 --> 00:31:37,147
This is chicken.
Here is the recipe.

529
00:31:37,147 --> 00:31:38,941
We are making veal marsala.

530
00:31:38,941 --> 00:31:41,818
Chicken!
Chicken marsala!

531
00:31:41,818 --> 00:31:44,530
Take a piece
of chicken like this.

532
00:31:44,530 --> 00:31:46,823
Slice, slice, slice, slice.

533
00:31:46,823 --> 00:31:50,994
This afternoon, I cut out
half of a lower intestine.

534
00:31:50,994 --> 00:31:53,539
It seemed like it was
a quarter of a mile long!

535
00:31:53,539 --> 00:31:55,958
Where is Charles Junior?

536
00:31:55,958 --> 00:31:58,836
He's late.
He said he'd be here at 7:00.

537
00:31:58,836 --> 00:32:00,629
It's only 8:00.

538
00:32:03,841 --> 00:32:04,842
Hello.

539
00:32:04,842 --> 00:32:06,844
Excuse me for a few minutes.

540
00:32:06,844 --> 00:32:08,303
Where are you going?

541
00:32:08,303 --> 00:32:09,888
Where's she going?

542
00:32:09,888 --> 00:32:12,558
To... out. I'm going
to the grocery store.

543
00:32:12,558 --> 00:32:14,518
I left my wallet there...

544
00:32:14,518 --> 00:32:16,520
and the people
that work there...

545
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:18,856
would very much like me
to come and get it.

546
00:32:18,856 --> 00:32:20,899
Can't your sister go
and pick it up...

547
00:32:20,899 --> 00:32:23,360
No! Because...

548
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:25,487
I have to sign for it,
of course...

549
00:32:25,487 --> 00:32:27,614
to prove that it's mine.

550
00:32:27,614 --> 00:32:29,783
Can't you just wait
until my brother gets here?

551
00:32:29,783 --> 00:32:31,910
I would like to make
a good impression.

552
00:32:31,910 --> 00:32:34,079
I would like the whole family
here to greet him.

553
00:32:34,079 --> 00:32:35,414
Who's going to cook dinner?

554
00:32:35,414 --> 00:32:36,957
My sister.

555
00:32:36,957 --> 00:32:38,041
Let's go out to eat.

556
00:32:38,041 --> 00:32:40,711
Marjorie!
Your sister can't cook.

557
00:32:40,711 --> 00:32:43,839
Yes, she can. I just taught her.
It's just chicken, Harry.

558
00:32:45,007 --> 00:32:47,467
There's Charles.

559
00:32:55,893 --> 00:32:57,394
Dr. Turner?

560
00:32:57,394 --> 00:32:58,896
What the...

561
00:32:58,896 --> 00:33:01,190
If you'd just sign here, please.

562
00:33:02,482 --> 00:33:05,319
I'll bet this is
from the polypectomy...

563
00:33:05,319 --> 00:33:07,070
I did this morning.

564
00:33:07,070 --> 00:33:11,116
The young lady
seemed very grateful.

565
00:33:12,326 --> 00:33:13,994
Oh, it's lovely.

566
00:33:14,828 --> 00:33:16,747
What does she say?

567
00:33:17,915 --> 00:33:21,210
This is typical.
It's from Charles.

568
00:33:23,003 --> 00:33:24,463
Charles?

569
00:33:24,463 --> 00:33:27,424
Charles sent fruit.
Isn't that sweet?

570
00:33:27,424 --> 00:33:29,218
It's an hour late.
This isn't fruit.

571
00:33:29,218 --> 00:33:31,011
This is a total lack
of consideration.

572
00:33:31,011 --> 00:33:33,013
It looks like fruit to me.

573
00:33:33,013 --> 00:33:35,516
What does the card say?

574
00:33:37,351 --> 00:33:39,061
"Start without me."

575
00:33:39,061 --> 00:33:41,021
He's going to be late.

576
00:33:46,360 --> 00:33:48,820
All right, Mrs. Turner,
do you remember me?

577
00:33:48,820 --> 00:33:52,324
I just wanted to tell you that
I didn't mean any of this...

578
00:33:52,324 --> 00:33:54,326
and I know
you must be just...

579
00:33:54,326 --> 00:33:56,870
But I just feel so terrible.

580
00:33:56,870 --> 00:33:58,580
Do you have my wallet?

581
00:33:58,580 --> 00:33:59,665
Pardon me?

582
00:33:59,665 --> 00:34:01,416
My wallet.

583
00:34:08,799 --> 00:34:13,971
I'm in the vertical
blinds business, right?

584
00:34:13,971 --> 00:34:16,181
And I was doing
an installation here.

585
00:34:16,181 --> 00:34:19,017
I'll show you.

586
00:34:19,017 --> 00:34:22,604
I was like this,
working on the window...

587
00:34:22,604 --> 00:34:25,107
and I didn't see him sleeping.

588
00:34:28,819 --> 00:34:30,571
Sleeping?

589
00:34:30,571 --> 00:34:34,408
Yeah. I was having trouble
with this bracket...

590
00:34:34,408 --> 00:34:36,827
which is not normally the case
with this particular model...

591
00:34:36,827 --> 00:34:40,956
but I had to use force,
and I jammed up in there.

592
00:34:40,956 --> 00:34:42,749
This got caught...

593
00:34:42,749 --> 00:34:44,626
and I was pulling
and pulling and pulling...

594
00:34:44,626 --> 00:34:47,337
and then it came loose
and... Oh, jeez!

595
00:34:47,337 --> 00:34:49,131
Just about like that.

596
00:34:49,131 --> 00:34:50,632
And...

597
00:34:51,925 --> 00:34:54,386
It came down right on him.

598
00:34:54,386 --> 00:35:00,475
It stabbed him, really,
right in the left temple.

599
00:35:05,814 --> 00:35:07,274
Right there.

600
00:35:13,655 --> 00:35:16,617
At least he went in his sleep.

601
00:35:18,035 --> 00:35:21,580
It was quick.
I doubt if he felt any pain.

602
00:35:22,706 --> 00:35:24,583
Are you all right?

603
00:35:24,583 --> 00:35:27,836
Do you want any...
Do you want any water?

604
00:35:27,836 --> 00:35:29,463
No, thank you.

605
00:35:30,964 --> 00:35:33,342
I guess I should just
call the hospital.

606
00:35:33,342 --> 00:35:35,594
No, you can't do that!
You can't call the hospital.

607
00:35:37,054 --> 00:35:39,056
Why not?

608
00:35:39,056 --> 00:35:45,896
Because I can't bring him
to the hospital.

609
00:35:45,896 --> 00:35:48,023
Why is that?

610
00:35:49,983 --> 00:35:51,902
Because he's not my husband.

611
00:35:51,902 --> 00:35:54,446
No... now, Mrs. Turner,
let's face the facts.

612
00:35:54,446 --> 00:35:55,948
Sit down.

613
00:35:55,948 --> 00:35:58,033
Your husband is a doctor.

614
00:35:58,033 --> 00:35:59,493
Yes, he is, but...

615
00:35:59,493 --> 00:36:03,080
No. I found his wallet,
and I looked in the I.D.

616
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:06,416
So I know he's your husband...
Dr. Charles Turner.

617
00:36:06,416 --> 00:36:09,086
No. That is my...
This is...

618
00:36:10,420 --> 00:36:12,422
He's my brother-in-law.

619
00:36:12,422 --> 00:36:14,424
Let's stick with reality.

620
00:36:14,424 --> 00:36:17,261
You both have
the same last name.

621
00:36:17,261 --> 00:36:21,890
That's how we both
have the same last name.

622
00:36:28,856 --> 00:36:32,109
I didn't know he was
my brother-in-law.

623
00:36:32,109 --> 00:36:38,448
I had never met him...
until this afternoon.

624
00:36:38,448 --> 00:36:41,368
I guess you two
just hit it off, then.

625
00:36:41,368 --> 00:36:43,579
Yeah, we really did.

626
00:36:45,414 --> 00:36:48,125
But my husband doesn't
know about this...

627
00:36:48,125 --> 00:36:51,128
and I would be
ever so grateful...

628
00:36:51,128 --> 00:36:54,047
if you could be here
when the police arrive.

629
00:36:54,047 --> 00:36:55,299
Police?

630
00:36:55,299 --> 00:36:56,800
Yeah, and you know what?

631
00:36:56,800 --> 00:37:00,053
They wouldn't even have to know
that I was here today...

632
00:37:00,053 --> 00:37:01,972
if you didn't want to tell them.

633
00:37:01,972 --> 00:37:04,266
No, we can't call the police.

634
00:37:04,266 --> 00:37:08,395
What I mean is, you can
call the police, but I can't.

635
00:37:08,395 --> 00:37:11,398
I can't even be here
when the police arrive.

636
00:37:11,398 --> 00:37:13,192
How come?

637
00:37:13,192 --> 00:37:15,944
I just can't.

638
00:37:18,906 --> 00:37:21,408
What are we going to do
about him?

639
00:37:21,408 --> 00:37:23,911
Maybe if I call the hospital.

640
00:37:23,911 --> 00:37:25,913
No, you can't call
the hospital, either...

641
00:37:25,913 --> 00:37:27,289
because if you call
the hospital...

642
00:37:27,289 --> 00:37:28,624
they will notify the police.

643
00:37:28,624 --> 00:37:30,501
That's standard procedure.
I know that.

644
00:37:30,501 --> 00:37:31,793
What about your family?
Can't you call anybody?

645
00:37:31,793 --> 00:37:34,463
No! I can't call my family!
They would tell my husband...

646
00:37:34,463 --> 00:37:36,423
and he would find out
that l... Oh, god!

647
00:37:36,423 --> 00:37:38,425
What are we going to do?

648
00:37:38,425 --> 00:37:41,220
I don't know. I don't know
what we're doing! God!

649
00:37:41,220 --> 00:37:43,430
All right.
This is a definite tragedy...

650
00:37:43,430 --> 00:37:45,390
but it's also an accident...

651
00:37:45,390 --> 00:37:47,392
and I think we ought to not
lose sight of that.

652
00:37:47,392 --> 00:37:49,019
He's dead!

653
00:37:49,019 --> 00:37:51,939
I think we ought to not
lose sight of that!

654
00:37:51,939 --> 00:37:53,482
Let's stay calm.

655
00:37:53,482 --> 00:37:55,442
How am I supposed
to stay calm?

656
00:37:55,442 --> 00:37:56,944
All right,
i'll tell you what.

657
00:37:56,944 --> 00:38:00,030
I think we should
probably just...

658
00:38:01,865 --> 00:38:04,826
I think we should
get rid of the body.

659
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:11,542
Did you say...

660
00:38:12,835 --> 00:38:14,586
Get rid of the body?

661
00:38:14,586 --> 00:38:18,173
Yeah. It's in both
of our best interest.

662
00:38:21,426 --> 00:38:25,264
Get rid of the body.

663
00:38:25,264 --> 00:38:27,266
Do you have a better idea?

664
00:38:28,892 --> 00:38:32,437
No. I'm not real good
with stuff like this.

665
00:38:32,437 --> 00:38:34,940
I don't want to be involved.
I really don't.

666
00:38:34,940 --> 00:38:37,401
I don't think I should be
involved in this.

667
00:38:37,401 --> 00:38:38,610
Why not?

668
00:38:38,610 --> 00:38:40,404
Because I can't.
I can't! God! Lord!

669
00:38:40,404 --> 00:38:44,157
If you run out on me now,
you're going to force me...

670
00:38:44,157 --> 00:38:45,909
to call your real husband.

671
00:38:48,704 --> 00:38:50,664
If you call my husband...

672
00:38:52,708 --> 00:38:55,544
I'm calling the police!

673
00:38:55,544 --> 00:38:57,421
Yes, I will!

674
00:39:01,133 --> 00:39:04,386
Yes... I will.

675
00:39:15,063 --> 00:39:17,608
Oh, dear.
Oh, dear.

676
00:39:17,608 --> 00:39:20,235
All right.
All right...

677
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:25,324
I know there's
got to be a solution.

678
00:39:30,078 --> 00:39:32,122
A suicide.

679
00:39:32,122 --> 00:39:35,459
Lady, don't think like that.

680
00:39:35,459 --> 00:39:37,419
There's got to be
a better way out.

681
00:39:37,419 --> 00:39:41,840
Not me!
Him.

682
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:44,510
He's going to...

683
00:39:46,637 --> 00:39:48,555
Know what we can use?

684
00:39:48,555 --> 00:39:49,848
These.

685
00:39:51,934 --> 00:39:54,144
3L21.

686
00:39:55,938 --> 00:39:57,481
21. Go ahead.

687
00:39:57,481 --> 00:40:00,317
We got an emergency call
reporting a fatality...

688
00:40:00,317 --> 00:40:02,945
only there's no victim
at the recorded address.

689
00:40:02,945 --> 00:40:04,696
What's the cause of death?

690
00:40:04,696 --> 00:40:06,823
Caller didn't say.
I thought you might want to...

691
00:40:06,823 --> 00:40:08,534
check out the origin
of the call.

692
00:40:08,534 --> 00:40:09,952
The lady seemed pretty upset.

693
00:40:09,952 --> 00:40:11,495
I'll check it out.
What's the address?

694
00:40:11,495 --> 00:40:13,455
28 Oak Tree Road.

695
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:40,482
Excuse me, miss.
I'm Captain Meany...

696
00:40:40,482 --> 00:40:42,526
with the Summit Bluff police.

697
00:40:42,526 --> 00:40:46,405
I knocked on your front door.
You must not have heard me.

698
00:40:48,699 --> 00:40:50,242
What's wrong?

699
00:40:50,242 --> 00:40:52,035
I'm checking out
an emergency call.

700
00:40:52,035 --> 00:40:54,371
It came from your address
about 6:45 tonight.

701
00:40:54,371 --> 00:40:55,664
What emergency?

702
00:40:55,664 --> 00:40:57,165
Do you live here?

703
00:40:57,165 --> 00:40:59,001
No. My sister
and her husband do.

704
00:40:59,001 --> 00:41:00,210
Are they at home?

705
00:41:00,210 --> 00:41:03,463
No. They just left.

706
00:41:03,463 --> 00:41:05,507
But my sister
should be back soon.

707
00:41:05,507 --> 00:41:08,510
Do you mind if I ask you
a few questions?

708
00:41:08,510 --> 00:41:10,470
Only take a couple of minutes.

709
00:41:10,470 --> 00:41:11,722
Sure.

710
00:41:13,056 --> 00:41:14,558
Come in.

711
00:41:14,558 --> 00:41:16,185
All right.

712
00:41:26,904 --> 00:41:28,947
Let me see if I've got
everything.

713
00:41:28,947 --> 00:41:31,617
You came over
at approximately 6:30 p. m...

714
00:41:31,617 --> 00:41:34,870
to help your sister cook
for a dinner party...

715
00:41:34,870 --> 00:41:39,458
and shortly thereafter,
everyone decided to eat out.

716
00:41:39,458 --> 00:41:40,667
Yeah.

717
00:41:40,667 --> 00:41:43,462
Are you sure it's a woman
who made the phone call?

718
00:41:43,462 --> 00:41:44,671
Yeah.

719
00:41:44,671 --> 00:41:47,049
Because it definitely wasn't
my sister's in-laws.

720
00:41:47,049 --> 00:41:48,675
That family receives
crank calls.

721
00:41:48,675 --> 00:41:50,469
They don't make them.

722
00:41:50,469 --> 00:41:52,596
That leaves
you and your sister.

723
00:41:52,596 --> 00:41:55,474
I know I didn't make
any crank call.

724
00:41:55,474 --> 00:41:58,185
And I know my sister would never
make a crank call...

725
00:41:58,185 --> 00:41:59,686
believe you me.

726
00:41:59,686 --> 00:42:03,774
But I know you probably
can't just take my word for it.

727
00:42:03,774 --> 00:42:06,068
I like to be thorough.

728
00:42:08,445 --> 00:42:10,948
But I'll tell you...

729
00:42:10,948 --> 00:42:13,992
Sometimes I go
on instinct alone.

730
00:42:13,992 --> 00:42:17,120
I believe in instinct, too.

731
00:42:17,120 --> 00:42:18,830
It's always right, isn't it?

732
00:42:18,830 --> 00:42:20,832
100% of the time.

733
00:42:25,963 --> 00:42:27,756
Thanks for the coffee.

734
00:42:27,756 --> 00:42:29,591
It's tea.

735
00:42:29,591 --> 00:42:33,470
What? You're kidding.
This is tea?

736
00:42:33,470 --> 00:42:34,596
No!

737
00:42:36,473 --> 00:42:38,475
Son of a gun, it is tea!

738
00:42:38,475 --> 00:42:41,478
Usually I hate tea,
but this is good.

739
00:42:41,478 --> 00:42:42,980
I used two bags.

740
00:42:42,980 --> 00:42:44,857
That's your trick.

741
00:42:44,857 --> 00:42:46,817
I don't usually cook.

742
00:42:46,817 --> 00:42:50,320
I don't have the time
because I have this career.

743
00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:56,743
That's understandable.
Thanks for the...

744
00:43:02,916 --> 00:43:04,918
What do you do?

745
00:43:04,918 --> 00:43:07,337
I work at Carl's Fish Fair.

746
00:43:07,337 --> 00:43:09,047
I've been there.

747
00:43:09,047 --> 00:43:10,966
I never saw you there.

748
00:43:10,966 --> 00:43:13,927
Probably because the day
I was there, you weren't there.

749
00:43:13,927 --> 00:43:16,221
Because I'd have remembered you.

750
00:43:16,221 --> 00:43:17,764
Thank you.

751
00:43:19,850 --> 00:43:21,643
I gotta go.

752
00:43:24,479 --> 00:43:27,149
You want to make sure
you lock this after I go.

753
00:43:32,446 --> 00:43:33,488
Good night.

754
00:43:33,488 --> 00:43:35,115
Good night, captain.

755
00:43:53,467 --> 00:43:55,219
How's this?

756
00:43:55,219 --> 00:43:58,680
"My darkness descends
deeper than I knew it could.

757
00:44:00,015 --> 00:44:04,311
"Enveloped in the blackness,
I search for some light.

758
00:44:04,311 --> 00:44:08,232
"Maybe now...
Maybe this time."

759
00:44:08,232 --> 00:44:09,566
That's beautiful.

760
00:44:09,566 --> 00:44:10,943
You really think so?

761
00:44:10,943 --> 00:44:15,405
I was really touched.
I really believed it.

762
00:44:15,405 --> 00:44:17,449
Thank you.

763
00:44:17,449 --> 00:44:19,618
I hope everybody else
believes it.

764
00:44:19,618 --> 00:44:24,456
They definitely will.

765
00:44:24,456 --> 00:44:27,751
Do you think anyone
might recognize the handwriting?

766
00:44:27,751 --> 00:44:29,461
No. I wrote like a doctor.

767
00:44:32,881 --> 00:44:35,259
Where did you get all of these?

768
00:44:35,259 --> 00:44:36,593
From my husband, the doctor.

769
00:44:38,470 --> 00:44:40,264
He's a doctor?

770
00:44:40,264 --> 00:44:42,432
The whole family...
they're all doctors.

771
00:44:42,432 --> 00:44:45,269
They get these
samples of drugs...

772
00:44:45,269 --> 00:44:48,605
from these drug companies,
free of charge.

773
00:44:48,605 --> 00:44:51,859
I've got a lot of blue ones
in there now...

774
00:44:51,859 --> 00:44:53,944
and a lot of the red ones.

775
00:44:53,944 --> 00:44:55,654
You think I ought to...

776
00:44:55,654 --> 00:44:57,406
There's some more white ones.

777
00:44:57,406 --> 00:44:59,116
Yeah, use them all.

778
00:44:59,116 --> 00:45:00,993
Just stuff them down there.

779
00:45:05,914 --> 00:45:07,374
There they are.

780
00:45:09,418 --> 00:45:13,130
All right. I think
that about does it.

781
00:45:13,130 --> 00:45:17,634
Good. You have that done,
and I have this, and...

782
00:45:23,891 --> 00:45:29,104
Were you absolutely sure
that you got all these deals?

783
00:45:29,104 --> 00:45:30,856
What's that?

784
00:45:30,856 --> 00:45:32,149
The protection.

785
00:45:34,860 --> 00:45:36,737
How many were used?

786
00:45:38,780 --> 00:45:39,948
Five.

787
00:45:39,948 --> 00:45:41,700
Five.

788
00:45:43,452 --> 00:45:44,953
Wow!

789
00:45:44,953 --> 00:45:48,665
He had been out of the country
for a very, very long time.

790
00:45:48,665 --> 00:45:51,001
I see.

791
00:45:51,001 --> 00:45:54,087
We found four so far.

792
00:45:54,087 --> 00:45:57,925
Oh, rats!
Did you check the shower?

793
00:45:57,925 --> 00:46:00,636
Yes, I already got
the one in the shower.

794
00:46:00,636 --> 00:46:03,805
Already got the shower.
OK, we were...

795
00:46:03,805 --> 00:46:05,015
Shower!

796
00:46:08,894 --> 00:46:10,896
Do you have any idea...

797
00:46:10,896 --> 00:46:14,483
where that fifth one
might have been applied?

798
00:46:14,483 --> 00:46:16,485
Did you check out here
on the balcony?

799
00:46:16,485 --> 00:46:18,362
No, you got that one already.

800
00:46:18,362 --> 00:46:21,907
Yeah, I already got that one.
Let me see...

801
00:46:30,874 --> 00:46:32,584
Found it!

802
00:46:37,631 --> 00:46:39,842
What? He's still wearing it?

803
00:46:52,646 --> 00:46:55,482
Go ahead. Just...

804
00:46:55,482 --> 00:46:57,943
I'm not taking it off.

805
00:46:57,943 --> 00:47:02,406
You certainly can't expect me
to take it off.

806
00:47:02,406 --> 00:47:04,408
You ought to do something...

807
00:47:04,408 --> 00:47:07,411
because that's not
a very appropriate thing...

808
00:47:07,411 --> 00:47:09,037
for a suicide.

809
00:47:10,664 --> 00:47:13,834
I'm just absolutely not
taking it off.

810
00:47:13,834 --> 00:47:17,921
You are more familiar
with him than I am.

811
00:47:17,921 --> 00:47:19,882
Yes, but you have
done this before.

812
00:47:19,882 --> 00:47:21,884
I mean, this kind of thing
you have done.

813
00:47:21,884 --> 00:47:23,760
Haven't you sort of done this?

814
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:26,430
I've taken them
off me personally...

815
00:47:26,430 --> 00:47:31,768
but I've never taken them
off another man.

816
00:47:33,312 --> 00:47:36,440
Why don't you pretend
like he's you?

817
00:47:36,440 --> 00:47:39,484
No. This is where
I draw the line.

818
00:47:43,947 --> 00:47:47,242
All right. Fine.
I will do it myself.

819
00:47:47,242 --> 00:47:49,453
God, it's no big deal!

820
00:47:49,453 --> 00:47:53,540
I sort of think you're acting
like a little bit of a baby.

821
00:47:53,540 --> 00:47:56,502
It's just a body.

822
00:47:56,502 --> 00:48:03,717
A body is just a house
God gives us to live in.

823
00:48:03,717 --> 00:48:05,552
That's all our body is.

824
00:48:05,552 --> 00:48:08,931
And then we go away
to a different place...

825
00:48:08,931 --> 00:48:11,808
and we don't live
in our house anymore.

826
00:48:11,808 --> 00:48:14,478
Now, see? There.
Was that any big deal?

827
00:48:28,909 --> 00:48:30,410
Nick.

828
00:48:30,410 --> 00:48:31,411
Will!

829
00:48:31,411 --> 00:48:33,413
What are you doing here?

830
00:48:33,413 --> 00:48:38,919
I just thought
I'd stop by and say hello.

831
00:48:38,919 --> 00:48:40,921
Say hello?

832
00:48:40,921 --> 00:48:44,424
Yeah. I really need
something to drink.

833
00:48:44,424 --> 00:48:47,845
And maybe we could
have a little talk.

834
00:48:47,845 --> 00:48:50,389
Good. Because I really
need to talk.

835
00:48:50,389 --> 00:48:52,891
You need to talk?
You never need to talk.

836
00:48:52,891 --> 00:48:55,435
I'm always the one
that needs to talk.

837
00:48:55,435 --> 00:48:59,106
Do you got one of those
"not really beers" in here?

838
00:48:59,106 --> 00:49:00,858
It's on the door.

839
00:49:00,858 --> 00:49:02,693
Great.

840
00:49:04,653 --> 00:49:06,238
I've earned this tonight.

841
00:49:07,865 --> 00:49:11,994
I met a woman tonight.

842
00:49:11,994 --> 00:49:13,954
Yeah?

843
00:49:15,539 --> 00:49:19,376
So did I, only I can't
really date this one.

844
00:49:19,376 --> 00:49:22,754
We're sort of
in a business deal together...

845
00:49:22,754 --> 00:49:24,840
because of a certain event.

846
00:49:24,840 --> 00:49:31,388
I don't know what
she sees in me, but...

847
00:49:31,388 --> 00:49:34,933
we talked for over an hour.

848
00:49:34,933 --> 00:49:36,977
She made me feel important.

849
00:49:36,977 --> 00:49:38,604
Who?

850
00:49:38,604 --> 00:49:41,565
The woman I met tonight.

851
00:49:41,565 --> 00:49:44,401
Yeah?
I think you're important.

852
00:49:44,401 --> 00:49:45,903
You think I'm important...

853
00:49:45,903 --> 00:49:48,405
because I'm always getting you
out of trouble.

854
00:49:48,405 --> 00:49:49,907
She's different.

855
00:49:49,907 --> 00:49:51,909
She doesn't want
anything from me.

856
00:49:51,909 --> 00:49:53,994
I don't want anything from you.

857
00:49:53,994 --> 00:49:55,412
Just sit down.

858
00:49:55,412 --> 00:49:58,457
One of the reasons
why I came over here tonight...

859
00:49:58,457 --> 00:50:01,251
was I wanted
to find out about... tea!

860
00:50:01,251 --> 00:50:02,961
You're drinking tea.

861
00:50:02,961 --> 00:50:04,755
Yeah. Tea's good.

862
00:50:04,755 --> 00:50:09,718
This girl is younger than me,
but in a lot of ways...

863
00:50:09,718 --> 00:50:11,512
she's more independent
than I am.

864
00:50:11,512 --> 00:50:13,305
She really understands me.

865
00:50:13,305 --> 00:50:14,640
I understand you.

866
00:50:14,640 --> 00:50:19,520
And I like who I am
when I'm with her.

867
00:50:20,938 --> 00:50:26,610
Wilbur, about this
chief-of-police thing...

868
00:50:26,610 --> 00:50:32,449
What if something...
minor happened?

869
00:50:32,449 --> 00:50:36,453
What's the most minor thing
that could happen...

870
00:50:36,453 --> 00:50:38,622
and you'd still be OK?

871
00:50:38,622 --> 00:50:40,958
Are you in trouble again?

872
00:50:40,958 --> 00:50:47,631
No, no!
I was just wondering.

873
00:50:47,631 --> 00:50:49,258
Her name is Jeanine.

874
00:50:50,843 --> 00:50:52,678
I gotta call her.

875
00:50:52,678 --> 00:50:57,307
No, I was just wondering if...

876
00:50:57,307 --> 00:50:59,101
I was wondering how much...

877
00:50:59,101 --> 00:51:02,938
accidental manslaughter
will hurt your chances.

878
00:51:02,938 --> 00:51:04,189
God.

879
00:51:10,445 --> 00:51:12,406
When did you find out?

880
00:51:14,908 --> 00:51:16,994
We got the call this morning.

881
00:51:16,994 --> 00:51:20,455
Someone from the hotel
housekeeping staff found him.

882
00:51:20,455 --> 00:51:22,958
Why was he staying
in a hotel, anyway?

883
00:51:22,958 --> 00:51:24,877
He was supposed
to stay with us.

884
00:51:24,877 --> 00:51:27,004
I spent over $900...

885
00:51:27,004 --> 00:51:30,632
on new slipcovers
for the guest room.

886
00:51:30,632 --> 00:51:33,468
Maybe he was too depressed
to be with anybody.

887
00:51:33,468 --> 00:51:35,220
How would she know?

888
00:51:35,220 --> 00:51:38,390
Marjorie gets depressed
sometimes.

889
00:51:38,390 --> 00:51:42,603
Yeah. Every now and then,
I get a little blue.

890
00:51:42,603 --> 00:51:45,647
What on God's earth did Charles
have to be depressed about?

891
00:51:45,647 --> 00:51:49,902
Charles is gone.
I can't believe he's gone!

892
00:51:49,902 --> 00:51:52,821
Why did he do it?

893
00:51:55,449 --> 00:51:58,994
He left this note.

894
00:52:00,245 --> 00:52:01,914
A note?

895
00:52:03,373 --> 00:52:08,629
"My darkness descends deeper
than I knew it could."

896
00:52:09,880 --> 00:52:14,468
"Enveloped in the blackness,
I search for some light."

897
00:52:17,429 --> 00:52:22,518
"Maybe now...
Maybe this time."

898
00:52:25,604 --> 00:52:28,607
What a beautiful note!

899
00:52:28,607 --> 00:52:31,026
Did you really like the note?

900
00:52:33,445 --> 00:52:36,031
Of course we like the note.

901
00:52:36,031 --> 00:52:39,451
What kind of
a question is that?

902
00:52:39,451 --> 00:52:42,120
A very insensitive one!

903
00:52:43,747 --> 00:52:45,999
He should have been here,
where he belonged...

904
00:52:45,999 --> 00:52:49,837
with his family
at his coming-home party.

905
00:52:49,837 --> 00:52:53,131
Maybe he didn't
want to be here.

906
00:52:55,175 --> 00:52:59,054
I have never seen you
this talkative before!

907
00:52:59,054 --> 00:53:01,056
Children, I'm afraid
there are still...

908
00:53:01,056 --> 00:53:04,852
certain details to discuss.

909
00:53:04,852 --> 00:53:06,770
The funeral...

910
00:53:11,441 --> 00:53:15,070
Before we get into that,
I was thinking about...

911
00:53:16,905 --> 00:53:18,740
The organ donation center...

912
00:53:18,740 --> 00:53:20,576
You know what I was thinking?

913
00:53:20,576 --> 00:53:22,953
I was thinking that Charles
would have liked it...

914
00:53:22,953 --> 00:53:25,789
if we donated
his organs to science.

915
00:53:25,789 --> 00:53:30,043
Iris, that's
an excellent idea!

916
00:53:30,043 --> 00:53:31,962
Harry.

917
00:53:32,963 --> 00:53:34,047
Harry?

918
00:53:35,382 --> 00:53:37,384
Do you really think
that's necessary?

919
00:53:37,384 --> 00:53:39,469
Yes.

920
00:53:39,469 --> 00:53:42,806
Yes, I think it's appropriate.

921
00:53:42,806 --> 00:53:46,476
Otherwise, I wouldn't
have suggested it.

922
00:53:46,476 --> 00:53:50,480
Yes. My Charles
would have liked that.

923
00:53:50,480 --> 00:53:52,566
Thank you, Iris.

924
00:54:15,422 --> 00:54:17,466
Guess what.

925
00:54:17,466 --> 00:54:20,719
I met this guy.
I think I really like him.

926
00:54:20,719 --> 00:54:23,972
You always think you like them
for 24 hours.

927
00:54:25,682 --> 00:54:27,184
You always do this.

928
00:54:27,184 --> 00:54:28,894
Do what?

929
00:54:28,894 --> 00:54:30,103
Whenever
something good happens...

930
00:54:30,103 --> 00:54:32,940
you have to find something bad
to say about me.

931
00:54:32,940 --> 00:54:34,358
That's not true.

932
00:54:34,358 --> 00:54:36,818
Then try being happy for me
for once, OK?

933
00:54:39,988 --> 00:54:41,198
OK.

934
00:54:44,868 --> 00:54:47,746
So, tell me about him.

935
00:54:47,746 --> 00:54:51,083
He's not like the men
I usually date.

936
00:54:51,083 --> 00:54:52,918
He has a job?

937
00:54:52,918 --> 00:54:55,462
Yeah. And we haven't
known each other that long...

938
00:54:55,462 --> 00:54:57,965
but we talked all night
on the phone.

939
00:54:57,965 --> 00:55:00,509
And get this...
he loves fish.

940
00:55:00,509 --> 00:55:03,387
Not only that,
but he has a tank.

941
00:55:03,387 --> 00:55:06,223
It's small, but he says
he wants to get a bigger one.

942
00:55:06,223 --> 00:55:08,892
He sounds really committed
to his fish.

943
00:55:08,892 --> 00:55:10,894
It's more
than just fish, though.

944
00:55:10,894 --> 00:55:13,063
We're getting
to know each other.

945
00:55:13,063 --> 00:55:15,482
He told me about
his two old girlfriends.

946
00:55:15,482 --> 00:55:17,609
I'm telling him
about my past relationships.

947
00:55:19,069 --> 00:55:21,947
The weirdest thing is,
I owe it all to you.

948
00:55:21,947 --> 00:55:23,740
What do you mean?

949
00:55:23,740 --> 00:55:26,243
I met him at your place
last night...

950
00:55:26,243 --> 00:55:28,245
and I'm nuts about him.

951
00:55:28,245 --> 00:55:30,163
Last night?

952
00:55:30,163 --> 00:55:32,249
Yeah. After you all left...

953
00:55:32,249 --> 00:55:35,878
he came around
investigating a crank call.

954
00:55:35,878 --> 00:55:37,087
What?

955
00:55:37,087 --> 00:55:39,798
Does he work
for the telephone company?

956
00:55:39,798 --> 00:55:43,051
Nope. He's a cop.

957
00:55:44,553 --> 00:55:46,096
Cop? A policeman?

958
00:55:46,096 --> 00:55:49,141
There was a policeman
in my house last night?

959
00:55:49,141 --> 00:55:53,729
Yep. And I am going to be
at his house tonight.

960
00:55:53,729 --> 00:55:55,105
Why didn't you tell me this?

961
00:55:55,105 --> 00:55:56,940
I forgot.

962
00:55:56,940 --> 00:55:58,358
Does Harry know?

963
00:55:58,358 --> 00:56:00,360
No. I was going to call
you guys and tell you...

964
00:56:00,360 --> 00:56:02,404
only Wilbur called...
that's his name, Wilbur...

965
00:56:02,404 --> 00:56:05,449
and we talked all night,
so I thought I'd tell you today.

966
00:56:05,449 --> 00:56:07,075
This is just like you!

967
00:56:07,075 --> 00:56:08,994
It's no big deal.

968
00:56:08,994 --> 00:56:11,580
Only he still
needs to talk to you.

969
00:56:11,580 --> 00:56:14,791
Me? Why?

970
00:56:14,791 --> 00:56:16,585
There was
this crank call made...

971
00:56:16,585 --> 00:56:19,254
and he said they traced it
back to your house.

972
00:56:19,254 --> 00:56:21,465
What do you mean
by a crank call?

973
00:56:21,465 --> 00:56:23,800
A 911 call.

974
00:56:23,800 --> 00:56:26,303
Oh, lord.

975
00:56:26,303 --> 00:56:28,263
Don't worry. I told him
it was a mistake.

976
00:56:28,263 --> 00:56:29,973
Did he believe you?

977
00:56:29,973 --> 00:56:32,142
Of course!
Why wouldn't he?

978
00:56:32,142 --> 00:56:35,437
I just knew something like this
was going to happen.

979
00:56:35,437 --> 00:56:38,273
Wilbur needs to talk to you
about this crank call...

980
00:56:38,273 --> 00:56:40,275
on account of he's up
for police chief...

981
00:56:40,275 --> 00:56:42,778
and he wants to cover
all his bases.

982
00:56:42,778 --> 00:56:46,823
Only I don't want you to say
anything bad about me, OK?

983
00:56:46,823 --> 00:56:50,494
I really like this guy.
All right?

984
00:56:50,494 --> 00:56:52,079
OK!

985
00:56:52,079 --> 00:56:53,830
What's wrong?

986
00:56:53,830 --> 00:56:55,832
Nothing.

987
00:57:05,425 --> 00:57:06,635
God!

988
00:57:16,687 --> 00:57:18,188
Marjorie?

989
00:57:20,691 --> 00:57:23,360
Marjorie, are you OK?

990
00:57:23,360 --> 00:57:27,155
Yes. I'm just
a little emotional.

991
00:57:29,199 --> 00:57:31,702
I missed choir practice
this morning...

992
00:57:31,702 --> 00:57:33,704
and I just hate myself!

993
00:57:33,704 --> 00:57:35,873
I hate to sound
like a broken record...

994
00:57:35,873 --> 00:57:38,375
but I know how to cure you
of these moods of yours.

995
00:57:38,375 --> 00:57:40,377
I don't think so.

996
00:57:40,377 --> 00:57:43,547
You should get rid of Harry
and have an affair.

997
00:57:44,882 --> 00:57:46,884
As soon as you and Harry
clear things up...

998
00:57:46,884 --> 00:57:49,386
then you won't be
so jealous of me.

999
00:57:49,386 --> 00:57:53,223
I am not jealous of you!

1000
00:57:53,223 --> 00:57:55,893
Oh, yeah?
Then why are you crying?

1001
00:57:55,893 --> 00:57:59,730
I am crying because
Harry's brother died.

1002
00:57:59,730 --> 00:58:02,733
Oh, please! You didn't
even know Charles.

1003
00:58:02,733 --> 00:58:04,234
I knew him!

1004
00:58:04,234 --> 00:58:08,030
Right. You knew of him,
but you didn't really know him.

1005
00:58:10,199 --> 00:58:13,202
I really knew him.

1006
00:58:13,202 --> 00:58:15,704
I killed him!

1007
00:58:18,707 --> 00:58:20,876
Marjorie,
do you have your period?

1008
00:58:20,876 --> 00:58:24,213
Are you listening to me,
god damn it?

1009
00:58:24,213 --> 00:58:26,715
You never curse!

1010
00:58:26,715 --> 00:58:29,551
Oh, Lord, forgive me.

1011
00:58:30,928 --> 00:58:34,890
Now I have two things
to confess in church this week.

1012
00:58:34,890 --> 00:58:37,226
What are you talking about?

1013
00:58:37,226 --> 00:58:41,230
I knew him
in the biblical sense.

1014
00:58:41,230 --> 00:58:42,731
What?

1015
00:58:42,731 --> 00:58:45,734
I met him, and we did it!

1016
00:58:45,734 --> 00:58:48,737
You had sex
with your brother-in-law?

1017
00:58:48,737 --> 00:58:52,115
It was not sex.
It was good!

1018
00:58:53,408 --> 00:58:56,495
And, Jeanine... I had one.

1019
00:58:56,495 --> 00:58:58,664
One what?

1020
00:58:58,664 --> 00:59:00,707
You know...

1021
00:59:00,707 --> 00:59:03,919
I don't believe this!

1022
00:59:03,919 --> 00:59:06,755
You said you killed him.
How'd you kill him?

1023
00:59:06,755 --> 00:59:08,215
Sex!

1024
00:59:08,215 --> 00:59:10,133
Sex?

1025
00:59:10,133 --> 00:59:14,930
I had an affair
because you told me to!

1026
00:59:19,977 --> 00:59:23,438
Excuse me. Excuse me.
I'm saying excuse me!

1027
00:59:23,438 --> 00:59:25,440
Marjorie,
this is so bizarre.

1028
00:59:25,440 --> 00:59:28,443
I know. I must have been
too powerful for him.

1029
00:59:28,443 --> 00:59:30,946
He had himself a heart attack!

1030
00:59:30,946 --> 00:59:32,447
While you were...

1031
00:59:32,447 --> 00:59:33,490
After!

1032
00:59:33,490 --> 00:59:36,827
I think it was after.
I hope it was after.

1033
00:59:46,461 --> 00:59:47,963
Howie, is that you?

1034
00:59:47,963 --> 00:59:48,964
No.

1035
00:59:48,964 --> 00:59:52,467
Iris. And Harry.

1036
00:59:52,467 --> 00:59:54,344
Just checking in.

1037
00:59:54,344 --> 00:59:57,014
You two shouldn't be in here.
This is highly irregular.

1038
00:59:57,014 --> 00:59:58,223
Calm down, Plotner.

1039
00:59:58,223 --> 01:00:00,184
Just going to make sure
our brother is in good hands.

1040
01:00:00,184 --> 01:00:02,102
Yeah, but you shouldn't
be in here. It's unethical.

1041
01:00:02,102 --> 01:00:04,897
The chest cavity appears to be
within normal limits.

1042
01:00:04,897 --> 01:00:07,232
Do you want to do this?

1043
01:00:08,692 --> 01:00:11,945
This is a funny thing.

1044
01:00:13,739 --> 01:00:16,533
Must be one
of those pills he took.

1045
01:00:16,533 --> 01:00:19,786
There's a whole clump of them
in his esophagus.

1046
01:00:19,786 --> 01:00:21,788
They didn't get digested.

1047
01:00:21,788 --> 01:00:24,041
None of these got digested.

1048
01:00:24,041 --> 01:00:26,960
What are you doing?
Get out of there!

1049
01:00:28,045 --> 01:00:30,047
Look at this.

1050
01:00:30,047 --> 01:00:31,882
Looks like an eraser.

1051
01:00:31,882 --> 01:00:33,550
From a pencil.

1052
01:00:33,550 --> 01:00:36,386
It's an eraser from a pencil.

1053
01:00:36,386 --> 01:00:39,223
Your brother was a weird guy.

1054
01:00:42,559 --> 01:00:44,895
Plotner, you got a second?

1055
01:00:44,895 --> 01:00:46,563
David.

1056
01:00:46,563 --> 01:00:48,065
Oh. Harry.

1057
01:00:48,065 --> 01:00:49,066
Yeah.

1058
01:00:49,066 --> 01:00:52,402
Take a look at this.
I don't understand it.

1059
01:00:52,402 --> 01:00:53,862
Charles was
an excellent doctor.

1060
01:00:53,862 --> 01:00:55,405
Why would he
try and kill himself...

1061
01:00:55,405 --> 01:00:57,866
with a thousand milligrams
of stool softener?

1062
01:00:57,866 --> 01:00:59,618
He tried to kill himself
with a laxative?

1063
01:00:59,618 --> 01:01:01,203
That and 800 milligrams...

1064
01:01:01,203 --> 01:01:03,080
of a nonsteroidal
anti-inflammatory.

1065
01:01:03,080 --> 01:01:05,415
That's for menstrual cramps.

1066
01:01:05,415 --> 01:01:06,500
I know.

1067
01:01:06,500 --> 01:01:08,836
Antihistamines,
aspirins, muscle relaxants...

1068
01:01:08,836 --> 01:01:11,547
vitamin tablets...
all in small dosages.

1069
01:01:11,547 --> 01:01:13,841
I don't get it.

1070
01:01:13,841 --> 01:01:16,343
Your brother...

1071
01:01:16,343 --> 01:01:20,055
wasn't he doing immunization
work in South America?

1072
01:01:20,055 --> 01:01:21,598
Yes.

1073
01:01:22,766 --> 01:01:24,268
He was brilliant.

1074
01:01:24,268 --> 01:01:27,646
Then he would have had access
to some very lethal medications.

1075
01:01:27,646 --> 01:01:31,066
I know. So why would he
take that stuff?

1076
01:01:31,066 --> 01:01:33,735
It's like he raided
somebody's medicine chest.

1077
01:01:33,735 --> 01:01:35,571
You might as well know.

1078
01:01:35,571 --> 01:01:37,865
I don't think that Charles
committed suicide.

1079
01:01:37,865 --> 01:01:39,575
What?

1080
01:01:39,575 --> 01:01:41,869
Harry, why do you say that?

1081
01:01:41,869 --> 01:01:44,371
For one thing, there was
scar tissue on the heart.

1082
01:01:44,371 --> 01:01:47,374
That usually indicates
a heart attack.

1083
01:01:47,374 --> 01:01:48,584
Heart attack.

1084
01:01:48,584 --> 01:01:51,545
Also, there were some signs
of sexual activity.

1085
01:01:55,591 --> 01:01:57,759
What about the suicide note?

1086
01:01:57,759 --> 01:01:59,761
That's the only thing
I can't understand...

1087
01:01:59,761 --> 01:02:01,722
because the lab reports
came back...

1088
01:02:01,722 --> 01:02:03,724
and the drugs that Charles took
are all highly suspect.

1089
01:02:03,724 --> 01:02:06,518
What's wrong
with the drugs he took?

1090
01:02:06,518 --> 01:02:08,145
Can't they kill you?

1091
01:02:08,145 --> 01:02:10,063
They'll give you the runs,
numb your ovaries...

1092
01:02:10,063 --> 01:02:12,024
and give you a very relaxed take
on your situation...

1093
01:02:12,024 --> 01:02:13,692
but they won't kill you.

1094
01:02:13,692 --> 01:02:17,321
I don't see why you have to
turn this into a police case.

1095
01:02:17,321 --> 01:02:18,822
Charles is dead.

1096
01:02:18,822 --> 01:02:22,201
Why don't you just let it be
and bury the man?

1097
01:02:22,201 --> 01:02:23,827
I can't, Marjorie.
I can't bury him...

1098
01:02:23,827 --> 01:02:25,746
until I find out
what happened.

1099
01:02:36,048 --> 01:02:37,549
Hi, Jeanine.

1100
01:02:37,549 --> 01:02:39,051
Hi. How you doing?

1101
01:02:39,051 --> 01:02:40,552
Good. Come on in.

1102
01:02:40,552 --> 01:02:42,054
I brought you something.

1103
01:02:42,054 --> 01:02:43,555
You didn't have to
bring anything.

1104
01:02:43,555 --> 01:02:44,848
I made a whole dinner.

1105
01:02:44,848 --> 01:02:47,559
No, it's not food.
It's a scavenger.

1106
01:02:47,559 --> 01:02:50,062
Take care of
any algae problems.

1107
01:02:50,062 --> 01:02:51,563
Where's your tank?

1108
01:02:51,563 --> 01:02:53,524
Right over there.
It's a bowl, actually.

1109
01:02:53,524 --> 01:02:55,025
A scavenger, huh?

1110
01:02:55,025 --> 01:02:58,070
That's great, because sometimes
I get a little algae.

1111
01:02:58,070 --> 01:02:59,571
A little?

1112
01:02:59,571 --> 01:03:01,573
That's very sweet of you.

1113
01:03:01,573 --> 01:03:04,076
This guy's going to have
a good time tonight.

1114
01:03:04,076 --> 01:03:05,661
I'm just going
to float him.

1115
01:03:05,661 --> 01:03:08,372
Let him get used
to the temperature.

1116
01:03:08,372 --> 01:03:09,998
Where's your brother?

1117
01:03:09,998 --> 01:03:13,001
I don't know. I don't even know
if he's coming.

1118
01:03:13,001 --> 01:03:15,546
But dinner's all ready.
Maybe we should just eat.

1119
01:03:15,546 --> 01:03:17,339
Relax.
He's just a little late.

1120
01:03:17,339 --> 01:03:19,925
Besides, I like it
when we're alone together.

1121
01:03:23,011 --> 01:03:27,015
I wanted you to meet
my brother up front.

1122
01:03:27,015 --> 01:03:28,559
Here, sit down.

1123
01:03:28,559 --> 01:03:31,019
I didn't want you to think...

1124
01:03:31,019 --> 01:03:34,022
that I was keeping
anything from you.

1125
01:03:34,022 --> 01:03:37,025
What would you
be keeping from me?

1126
01:03:37,025 --> 01:03:39,027
My brother.

1127
01:03:39,027 --> 01:03:40,571
What's wrong with him?

1128
01:03:40,571 --> 01:03:42,030
Nothing.
It's just that...

1129
01:03:42,030 --> 01:03:45,576
sometimes he has a hard time
holding onto a job...

1130
01:03:45,576 --> 01:03:47,035
or paying a bill.

1131
01:03:47,035 --> 01:03:48,579
I love spaghetti.

1132
01:03:48,579 --> 01:03:50,038
It's my specialty.

1133
01:03:50,038 --> 01:03:53,041
It's not that
my brother is lazy.

1134
01:03:53,041 --> 01:03:55,586
It's just that he isn't...

1135
01:03:55,586 --> 01:03:57,254
Isn't as accomplished as you?

1136
01:03:57,254 --> 01:03:58,714
That's not it.

1137
01:03:58,714 --> 01:04:01,800
Actually, I wish
he was more like you.

1138
01:04:01,800 --> 01:04:03,051
Do you know that...

1139
01:04:03,051 --> 01:04:06,013
you're the most independent
woman I've ever met...

1140
01:04:06,013 --> 01:04:07,806
that liked me back.

1141
01:04:07,806 --> 01:04:10,517
I know what it's like...

1142
01:04:10,517 --> 01:04:13,020
to be following
in someone's footsteps...

1143
01:04:13,020 --> 01:04:15,522
who is always doing
the right thing...

1144
01:04:15,522 --> 01:04:18,525
and constantly being judged
by their standards.

1145
01:04:18,525 --> 01:04:21,528
Maybe I am judging him
by my standards.

1146
01:04:21,528 --> 01:04:23,822
I'm sure your brother
would love to be like you...

1147
01:04:23,822 --> 01:04:25,741
but it doesn't sound
like he is.

1148
01:04:25,741 --> 01:04:28,660
That's it. For years,
I've hated feeling...

1149
01:04:28,660 --> 01:04:30,662
like I had to take
care of him.

1150
01:04:30,662 --> 01:04:33,457
Don't take care of him.
Just be his brother.

1151
01:04:33,457 --> 01:04:38,045
You're right.
That's what I've got to do.

1152
01:04:39,046 --> 01:04:40,631
Let's eat.

1153
01:04:40,631 --> 01:04:43,550
You don't really need
to meet my brother.

1154
01:04:43,550 --> 01:04:47,054
Just like you don't really have
to meet my sister.

1155
01:04:50,557 --> 01:04:51,892
Feed me.

1156
01:04:51,892 --> 01:04:54,061
Yes, ma'am.

1157
01:04:54,061 --> 01:04:56,563
You want sausage,
or do you want meatballs?

1158
01:04:56,563 --> 01:04:57,564
Both.

1159
01:04:57,564 --> 01:04:58,815
You got it.

1160
01:04:58,815 --> 01:05:00,567
Wilbur...

1161
01:05:00,567 --> 01:05:04,988
what's your feeling
on this prank call?

1162
01:05:04,988 --> 01:05:07,449
Your gut feeling?

1163
01:05:07,449 --> 01:05:08,992
It's nothing, I guess.

1164
01:05:08,992 --> 01:05:14,665
Wilbur, go with your gut.
Remember how often it's right.

1165
01:05:23,674 --> 01:05:25,467
Wilbur?

1166
01:05:25,467 --> 01:05:27,803
Wilbur?

1167
01:05:27,803 --> 01:05:32,808
Yeah. I'm sorry to wake you,
but I'm in jail.

1168
01:05:32,808 --> 01:05:34,268
I've turned myself in.

1169
01:05:34,268 --> 01:05:35,435
What for?

1170
01:05:36,979 --> 01:05:38,480
I killed a man.

1171
01:05:38,480 --> 01:05:39,857
What?

1172
01:05:39,857 --> 01:05:43,694
It was by accident,
but he's dead.

1173
01:05:43,694 --> 01:05:44,987
Dead?

1174
01:05:44,987 --> 01:05:46,488
What? What is it?

1175
01:05:46,488 --> 01:05:47,990
It's nothing.

1176
01:05:47,990 --> 01:05:49,992
Did you say that you...

1177
01:05:49,992 --> 01:05:51,326
Yeah.

1178
01:05:51,326 --> 01:05:54,997
I was in a hotel room
doing an installation...

1179
01:05:54,997 --> 01:05:56,498
and things went bad.

1180
01:05:56,498 --> 01:05:58,166
Oh, my god.
The hotel room.

1181
01:05:58,166 --> 01:05:59,501
That's my prank call!

1182
01:05:59,501 --> 01:06:02,504
The man's name
was Charles Turner.

1183
01:06:02,504 --> 01:06:03,964
I didn't even know him.

1184
01:06:03,964 --> 01:06:08,093
Oh, my god! You?
That was you?

1185
01:06:08,093 --> 01:06:09,803
I need a lawyer,
if you know any.

1186
01:06:09,803 --> 01:06:11,805
I hate to keep
leaning on you...

1187
01:06:11,805 --> 01:06:14,641
but I don't know how I'm going
to find one from in here.

1188
01:06:14,641 --> 01:06:16,518
Yeah, yeah.
I'll take care of it.

1189
01:06:16,518 --> 01:06:17,936
Great.

1190
01:06:17,936 --> 01:06:23,442
Will, I'm sorry.
When I get out of here...

1191
01:06:23,442 --> 01:06:25,444
after I've served my time...

1192
01:06:25,444 --> 01:06:28,155
I'm going to be
the greatest salesman ever...

1193
01:06:28,155 --> 01:06:31,742
and I'm going to pay you back
all the money I owe you.

1194
01:06:31,742 --> 01:06:32,951
OK?

1195
01:06:32,951 --> 01:06:34,453
OK.

1196
01:06:34,453 --> 01:06:36,872
I love you, Will.

1197
01:06:36,872 --> 01:06:38,457
Yeah. Right.

1198
01:06:47,466 --> 01:06:49,468
I know who killed Charles.

1199
01:06:49,468 --> 01:06:50,969
You do?

1200
01:06:50,969 --> 01:06:52,471
This is very difficult.

1201
01:06:52,471 --> 01:06:56,975
Look, Wilbur, this has nothing
to do with us. Really.

1202
01:06:56,975 --> 01:06:59,978
I know you're nothing
like your brother...

1203
01:06:59,978 --> 01:07:02,981
just like I'm nothing
like my sister. Nothing at all.

1204
01:07:02,981 --> 01:07:04,483
Jeanine...

1205
01:07:04,483 --> 01:07:06,485
I know, but it was
an accident.

1206
01:07:06,485 --> 01:07:08,737
There's a lot
at stake here, Wilbur.

1207
01:07:08,737 --> 01:07:10,864
How do you know?
You don't even know Nick.

1208
01:07:10,864 --> 01:07:11,865
Nick?

1209
01:07:11,865 --> 01:07:13,492
My brother.
He killed Charles.

1210
01:07:13,492 --> 01:07:14,535
What?

1211
01:07:14,535 --> 01:07:17,496
It was an accident.
He turned himself in.

1212
01:07:17,496 --> 01:07:19,957
That's why he didn't
show up for dinner.

1213
01:07:19,957 --> 01:07:23,502
He's in jail.
My little brother's in jail.

1214
01:07:23,502 --> 01:07:29,341
Wait a minute, now.
Just calm down, Wilbur.

1215
01:07:29,341 --> 01:07:31,385
I got to get a lawyer
and get him out.

1216
01:07:31,385 --> 01:07:33,387
He can't stay in jail.
He's not streetwise.

1217
01:07:33,387 --> 01:07:35,889
He could get killed in there.

1218
01:07:35,889 --> 01:07:38,100
How did you know
it was an accident?

1219
01:07:39,518 --> 01:07:42,521
I don't know.
I just thought...

1220
01:07:42,521 --> 01:07:46,024
I don't know.
You said that it was.

1221
01:07:46,024 --> 01:07:48,527
I got to find a lawyer.

1222
01:07:48,527 --> 01:07:50,028
What about you?

1223
01:07:50,028 --> 01:07:52,531
What about becoming
chief of police?

1224
01:07:52,531 --> 01:07:54,908
Five minutes ago, I wanted to be
chief of police...

1225
01:07:54,908 --> 01:07:56,743
more than anything
else in the world.

1226
01:07:56,743 --> 01:07:58,745
All the times
that he needed help...

1227
01:07:58,745 --> 01:08:00,414
I helped him because
I felt I had to.

1228
01:08:00,414 --> 01:08:01,498
Now I want to!

1229
01:08:01,498 --> 01:08:03,417
I don't care
if he did it or not.

1230
01:08:03,417 --> 01:08:05,335
He's my brother.
Screw the job.

1231
01:08:11,967 --> 01:08:13,677
Harry?

1232
01:08:13,677 --> 01:08:14,970
Yeah?

1233
01:08:18,473 --> 01:08:21,018
Honey, where have you
been all night?

1234
01:08:21,018 --> 01:08:24,313
At the lab, and then
at the police station.

1235
01:08:24,313 --> 01:08:28,317
What were you doing
at the police station?

1236
01:08:28,317 --> 01:08:29,776
Is there any coffee?

1237
01:08:29,776 --> 01:08:30,777
Yeah.

1238
01:08:32,446 --> 01:08:33,822
Anybody home?

1239
01:08:33,822 --> 01:08:34,907
In here.

1240
01:08:34,907 --> 01:08:36,992
What are they doing here?

1241
01:08:36,992 --> 01:08:38,368
I've called a family meeting.

1242
01:08:38,368 --> 01:08:39,786
What for?

1243
01:08:39,786 --> 01:08:41,538
Your front door was open.

1244
01:08:41,538 --> 01:08:42,623
So?

1245
01:08:42,623 --> 01:08:44,041
Do you want coffee?

1246
01:08:44,041 --> 01:08:45,167
Sure.

1247
01:08:45,167 --> 01:08:46,126
Please.

1248
01:08:47,711 --> 01:08:51,340
Don't move.
I'll make it.

1249
01:08:51,340 --> 01:08:53,842
This isn't going
to take long, I hope.

1250
01:08:53,842 --> 01:08:56,220
I've got two back-to-back
pap smears at 9:00.

1251
01:08:56,220 --> 01:08:58,347
No, it's not.
I just want to wait...

1252
01:08:58,347 --> 01:09:00,557
until mother and dad get here
to explain.

1253
01:09:00,557 --> 01:09:02,768
I don't want to have
to say it twice.

1254
01:09:02,768 --> 01:09:05,729
Your front door is open.

1255
01:09:05,729 --> 01:09:09,066
Iris left it open.

1256
01:09:09,066 --> 01:09:11,860
What's the big news?

1257
01:09:13,487 --> 01:09:15,364
Sit down.

1258
01:09:19,993 --> 01:09:21,995
I've been working
with the police...

1259
01:09:21,995 --> 01:09:24,998
on Charles' case,
as you all probably know, and...

1260
01:09:27,376 --> 01:09:29,211
We've found a murder suspect.

1261
01:09:33,006 --> 01:09:34,508
You did?

1262
01:09:34,508 --> 01:09:36,009
Who was it?

1263
01:09:36,009 --> 01:09:37,594
A salesman.

1264
01:09:37,594 --> 01:09:40,848
What kind of a salesman
would kill Charles?

1265
01:09:40,848 --> 01:09:43,350
A blinds salesman.

1266
01:09:43,350 --> 01:09:44,685
How could a blind salesman...

1267
01:09:44,685 --> 01:09:47,396
No, he sold blinds, dad...

1268
01:09:47,396 --> 01:09:50,691
and he dropped them
on Charles' head.

1269
01:09:52,192 --> 01:09:54,820
He claims it was an accident.

1270
01:09:54,820 --> 01:09:55,988
Oh, lord!

1271
01:09:55,988 --> 01:09:57,322
How do you know all this?

1272
01:09:57,322 --> 01:10:01,034
He turned himself in, confessed.
He even apologized.

1273
01:10:01,034 --> 01:10:02,536
He confessed?

1274
01:10:02,536 --> 01:10:03,954
Yeah.

1275
01:10:03,954 --> 01:10:05,455
What about the suicide?

1276
01:10:05,455 --> 01:10:07,541
This guy said he panicked...

1277
01:10:07,541 --> 01:10:09,459
and set it up to look
like Charles killed himself.

1278
01:10:09,459 --> 01:10:12,004
Oh, my lord!
He said that?

1279
01:10:12,004 --> 01:10:16,550
Harry said he confessed.
That's what confessed means.

1280
01:10:16,550 --> 01:10:18,051
I knew it.

1281
01:10:18,051 --> 01:10:20,888
I knew my Charles would never
take his own life.

1282
01:10:22,639 --> 01:10:25,267
Marjorie, I've got to
talk to you alone!

1283
01:10:25,267 --> 01:10:26,852
Jeanine, not now.

1284
01:10:26,852 --> 01:10:28,687
My boyfriend's brother
is in jail.

1285
01:10:28,687 --> 01:10:30,355
Jeanine, I said not now!

1286
01:10:30,355 --> 01:10:32,608
He is in jail
for killing Charles!

1287
01:10:34,067 --> 01:10:35,694
Wait.

1288
01:10:35,694 --> 01:10:37,946
Wait.
What are you saying?

1289
01:10:37,946 --> 01:10:40,199
That your boyfriend's brother
killed my brother?

1290
01:10:41,283 --> 01:10:43,869
Wait a minute. Your boyfriend
is Nick's brother?

1291
01:10:43,869 --> 01:10:45,871
Nick? I didn't
say his name.

1292
01:10:45,871 --> 01:10:48,123
- How do you know his name?
- How do you know Nick?

1293
01:10:48,123 --> 01:10:50,000
I always thought
she was too sweet...

1294
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:51,502
not to be hiding
something.

1295
01:10:51,502 --> 01:10:54,046
Wilbur was up
for chief of police, OK?

1296
01:10:54,046 --> 01:10:56,882
That's why Nick
couldn't go to the police.

1297
01:10:56,882 --> 01:10:58,342
How do you know Nick?

1298
01:10:58,342 --> 01:11:00,719
Nick is in jail.
He could be there for years.

1299
01:11:00,719 --> 01:11:02,554
Obviously where he belongs.

1300
01:11:02,554 --> 01:11:07,476
Marjorie, you got to help me.
Wilbur's a wreck.

1301
01:11:07,476 --> 01:11:10,479
I can't stand
to see him like this.

1302
01:11:10,479 --> 01:11:12,439
You love him, don't you?

1303
01:11:14,316 --> 01:11:17,444
Yeah, I do.

1304
01:11:17,444 --> 01:11:20,113
I really think
that you should leave.

1305
01:11:20,113 --> 01:11:24,493
Harry, I have something
to tell you...

1306
01:11:24,493 --> 01:11:26,078
privately.

1307
01:11:26,078 --> 01:11:27,496
What is it?

1308
01:11:27,496 --> 01:11:30,040
Harry, I need to talk
to you alone.

1309
01:11:30,040 --> 01:11:31,667
If you have something to say,
just say it now.

1310
01:11:31,667 --> 01:11:33,335
Harry, I need to talk
to you by yourself!

1311
01:11:33,335 --> 01:11:34,336
Just tell me!

1312
01:11:34,336 --> 01:11:35,462
I can't!

1313
01:11:35,462 --> 01:11:37,589
There should be no secrets
in this family!

1314
01:11:37,589 --> 01:11:39,466
God damn it, what is it?

1315
01:11:39,466 --> 01:11:41,343
I had an affair!

1316
01:11:52,020 --> 01:11:53,981
Harry, I'm sorry.

1317
01:11:57,693 --> 01:12:00,696
I'm sorry from the bottom
of my soul.

1318
01:12:00,696 --> 01:12:02,364
I'm sorry.

1319
01:12:02,364 --> 01:12:03,866
You're sorry?

1320
01:12:03,866 --> 01:12:06,243
Sorry is just not good enough
for my brother!

1321
01:12:06,243 --> 01:12:09,580
I knew it... from the day
he brought her home.

1322
01:12:09,580 --> 01:12:13,458
Harry... I wish
I could take it away.

1323
01:12:13,458 --> 01:12:16,837
I know how much
this hurts you.

1324
01:12:16,837 --> 01:12:18,589
Who was it?

1325
01:12:20,966 --> 01:12:23,719
I only slept with him once.

1326
01:12:28,473 --> 01:12:29,975
Just once.

1327
01:12:32,769 --> 01:12:34,855
But it...

1328
01:12:36,481 --> 01:12:40,152
It apparently made
quite an impact on him.

1329
01:12:40,152 --> 01:12:42,237
You were right about her.

1330
01:12:42,237 --> 01:12:43,697
Throw her out, Harry.

1331
01:12:43,697 --> 01:12:45,490
You don't have to
put up with this!

1332
01:12:45,490 --> 01:12:47,409
God damn it, Marjorie!
I'll kill him!

1333
01:12:47,409 --> 01:12:48,493
Harry, don't.

1334
01:12:48,493 --> 01:12:50,204
If I were you, Harry,
I'd kill both of them!

1335
01:12:50,204 --> 01:12:53,207
Let her go, son.
She's not worth it!

1336
01:12:53,207 --> 01:12:55,083
Who is he?

1337
01:12:55,083 --> 01:12:57,794
Harry, can't we talk
about this alone?

1338
01:12:57,794 --> 01:12:59,922
No! Who is he?

1339
01:12:59,922 --> 01:13:01,298
Who is he?

1340
01:13:01,298 --> 01:13:03,425
Was.

1341
01:13:03,425 --> 01:13:05,219
What does she mean "was"?

1342
01:13:05,219 --> 01:13:07,304
Are you telling me it's over?
Is that it?

1343
01:13:07,304 --> 01:13:09,056
He's out of your life now?

1344
01:13:09,056 --> 01:13:10,057
She'll do it again.

1345
01:13:10,057 --> 01:13:13,101
If they do it once,
they always do it a second time.

1346
01:13:13,101 --> 01:13:15,437
That god damn son of a bitch!
Who is he? Who is he?

1347
01:13:18,482 --> 01:13:19,942
Charles.

1348
01:13:21,235 --> 01:13:23,862
Charles is the man I slept with.

1349
01:13:25,072 --> 01:13:26,782
My brother Charles?

1350
01:13:26,782 --> 01:13:29,952
She slept with my Charles?

1351
01:13:31,036 --> 01:13:32,621
I don't believe it.

1352
01:13:32,621 --> 01:13:35,582
I thought you told me
Charles was dead.

1353
01:13:35,582 --> 01:13:37,793
He is dead!

1354
01:13:37,793 --> 01:13:39,711
That's disgusting!

1355
01:13:39,711 --> 01:13:41,588
No, no!

1356
01:13:41,588 --> 01:13:44,299
He died when we were doing...

1357
01:13:46,343 --> 01:13:48,345
I don't think
we should be hearing this.

1358
01:13:48,345 --> 01:13:50,556
Yes. Yes, we should.

1359
01:13:50,556 --> 01:13:52,099
But the note.

1360
01:13:52,099 --> 01:13:54,059
Charles left
that beautiful note.

1361
01:13:54,059 --> 01:13:56,562
I wrote the note.

1362
01:13:56,562 --> 01:13:57,813
You?

1363
01:13:58,939 --> 01:13:59,982
Why?

1364
01:13:59,982 --> 01:14:03,110
Because I didn't
want Harry to find out.

1365
01:14:03,110 --> 01:14:05,529
Because the second I did it...

1366
01:14:05,529 --> 01:14:08,532
I knew I'd made
a horrible mistake...

1367
01:14:08,532 --> 01:14:10,659
and I didn't want to lose him.

1368
01:14:10,659 --> 01:14:13,036
Of course you'd lose him,
you... slut!

1369
01:14:13,036 --> 01:14:14,496
Shut up, Iris!
Just shut up!

1370
01:14:15,622 --> 01:14:17,958
All of you! This is between
me and my wife!

1371
01:14:17,958 --> 01:14:20,335
You're one of us, son!
She isn't.

1372
01:14:20,335 --> 01:14:22,337
This concerns
all of us, Harry.

1373
01:14:22,337 --> 01:14:25,299
She isn't.
She's never been one of us.

1374
01:14:27,092 --> 01:14:29,011
Shut up!

1375
01:14:29,011 --> 01:14:30,262
Shut up. Shut up!

1376
01:14:32,472 --> 01:14:34,057
Now get the hell
out of my house!

1377
01:14:35,559 --> 01:14:39,730
Are you asking us
to leave your house?

1378
01:14:39,730 --> 01:14:41,398
Yes, mother.

1379
01:14:42,733 --> 01:14:44,359
Well!

1380
01:14:44,359 --> 01:14:46,612
I don't want to be here.

1381
01:14:49,865 --> 01:14:54,077
We're due at the hospital...
where we're wanted.

1382
01:14:59,583 --> 01:15:00,584
Iris!

1383
01:15:00,584 --> 01:15:01,585
Come on.

1384
01:15:07,049 --> 01:15:10,052
Marjorie, I'm so sorry.

1385
01:15:10,052 --> 01:15:13,013
Are you going to be OK?

1386
01:15:14,181 --> 01:15:16,016
I'll call you later.

1387
01:15:16,016 --> 01:15:17,017
Bye.

1388
01:15:22,064 --> 01:15:24,066
Harry...

1389
01:15:24,066 --> 01:15:26,360
can't you forgive me?

1390
01:15:29,071 --> 01:15:31,532
How many others were there
besides my brother?

1391
01:15:32,908 --> 01:15:34,451
None!

1392
01:15:34,451 --> 01:15:36,370
And the first guy
who comes along...

1393
01:15:36,370 --> 01:15:38,288
you do it to him to death?

1394
01:15:44,086 --> 01:15:46,088
Eight years!

1395
01:15:46,088 --> 01:15:49,299
Eight years of marriage,
I have been faithful.

1396
01:15:49,299 --> 01:15:53,095
How did you think...
How could you possibly think...

1397
01:15:53,095 --> 01:15:55,097
that you could keep this
hidden from me?

1398
01:15:55,097 --> 01:15:59,101
Were you waiting for some
special opportunity to tell me?

1399
01:15:59,101 --> 01:16:00,602
Like my birthday?

1400
01:16:00,602 --> 01:16:02,855
Do you think I haven't
had opportunities?

1401
01:16:02,855 --> 01:16:04,690
Because, boy, have I had...

1402
01:16:04,690 --> 01:16:06,441
There have been women
I've never even told you about.

1403
01:16:06,441 --> 01:16:08,777
They're everywhere.
The way they look at me...

1404
01:16:08,777 --> 01:16:11,530
in my waiting room,
outside the E.R.

1405
01:16:11,530 --> 01:16:15,033
Two years ago, at the colon
convention in Atlanta...

1406
01:16:15,033 --> 01:16:18,787
a blonde hematologist
put her room key in my hand.

1407
01:16:18,787 --> 01:16:21,540
Suite 1404.
And I gave it back!

1408
01:16:21,540 --> 01:16:23,083
Was I stupid!

1409
01:16:23,083 --> 01:16:25,627
What are you doing?

1410
01:16:25,627 --> 01:16:28,297
What? You think
you're going to leave me?

1411
01:16:28,297 --> 01:16:30,549
I'm not going
to let you leave me.

1412
01:16:30,549 --> 01:16:32,926
I'm leaving you!

1413
01:16:35,554 --> 01:16:37,931
Harry did leave me.

1414
01:16:37,931 --> 01:16:40,309
The truth is,
it didn't matter who left whom.

1415
01:16:40,309 --> 01:16:42,561
I was alone,
and I was scared.

1416
01:16:42,561 --> 01:16:43,979
Marjorie.

1417
01:16:45,564 --> 01:16:48,567
My sister suggested
I see a doctor.

1418
01:16:48,567 --> 01:16:51,486
Maybe you ought to go
see a doctor, huh?

1419
01:16:53,572 --> 01:16:57,075
That was really
the wrong thing to say.

1420
01:16:57,075 --> 01:17:00,078
I was desperate
to talk to Harry...

1421
01:17:00,078 --> 01:17:04,082
to tell him the truth about
what I did and why I did it...

1422
01:17:04,082 --> 01:17:07,085
and how sorry I really was
and that I loved him.

1423
01:17:07,085 --> 01:17:09,087
I found myself
in a full-blown depression.

1424
01:17:09,087 --> 01:17:11,006
I couldn't sleep.
I couldn't eat.

1425
01:17:11,006 --> 01:17:12,925
I couldn't stop
thinking about Harry.

1426
01:17:12,925 --> 01:17:16,094
I didn't know where he was.

1427
01:17:16,094 --> 01:17:18,889
Harry hadn't just
disappeared from my life...

1428
01:17:18,889 --> 01:17:21,892
but with a few deft turns
of a screwdriver...

1429
01:17:21,892 --> 01:17:24,937
he disappeared
from his family's life, too.

1430
01:17:24,937 --> 01:17:27,356
I used to worry a lot about
Nick, but I didn't have to.

1431
01:17:27,356 --> 01:17:28,857
His dream came true...

1432
01:17:28,857 --> 01:17:30,692
in the same room
where his nightmare began.

1433
01:17:30,692 --> 01:17:32,027
Mr. Diamond, I'm sorry.

1434
01:17:32,027 --> 01:17:33,362
But we haven't
been able to rent 402...

1435
01:17:33,362 --> 01:17:34,863
since this scandal started.

1436
01:17:34,863 --> 01:17:36,865
Of course you haven't.
Would you want to sleep...

1437
01:17:36,865 --> 01:17:38,825
in a bed where a stiff slept?

1438
01:17:38,825 --> 01:17:40,202
No. It's god damn creepy.

1439
01:17:40,202 --> 01:17:41,578
Get the god damn door
open, you fool.

1440
01:17:41,578 --> 01:17:44,122
What the hell
is going on here?

1441
01:17:44,122 --> 01:17:45,624
Who the hell is that?

1442
01:17:45,624 --> 01:17:48,126
I don't know, Mr. Diamond.

1443
01:17:48,126 --> 01:17:51,088
Just what do you think
you're doing up there?

1444
01:17:51,088 --> 01:17:54,591
I was just getting my blinds...

1445
01:17:56,134 --> 01:17:57,636
Put up here.

1446
01:17:57,636 --> 01:18:01,139
I heard there was
a tragedy in the room...

1447
01:18:01,139 --> 01:18:04,518
and I thought that it might
freshen it up a bit.

1448
01:18:06,562 --> 01:18:08,146
What do you think?

1449
01:18:08,146 --> 01:18:10,858
You sold the Sheraton?

1450
01:18:10,858 --> 01:18:13,652
I told you I'd do it
if you gave me enough time.

1451
01:18:13,652 --> 01:18:15,362
Sit down.

1452
01:18:15,362 --> 01:18:17,364
You're having lunch with me!

1453
01:18:18,782 --> 01:18:22,077
Nick really did turn out
to be a top-notch salesman...

1454
01:18:22,077 --> 01:18:25,914
and I've got a house
full of blinds to prove it.

1455
01:18:25,914 --> 01:18:29,084
Wilbur became chief of police.

1456
01:18:29,084 --> 01:18:32,087
My sister found herself
in a relationship...

1457
01:18:32,087 --> 01:18:35,090
that lasted
way more than 24 hours.

1458
01:18:35,090 --> 01:18:37,593
I knew it was serious...

1459
01:18:37,593 --> 01:18:40,721
when she moved her
10-gallon tank into his house.

1460
01:18:42,931 --> 01:18:46,101
As for me, I couldn't control
my feelings anymore.

1461
01:18:46,101 --> 01:18:48,979
So I tried to contain
them on paper...

1462
01:18:55,611 --> 01:18:58,989
After I figured out
how to use a typewriter.

1463
01:19:06,580 --> 01:19:09,833
Six months passed before I
realized I hadn't lost my mind.

1464
01:19:09,833 --> 01:19:13,128
I never thought I would be able
to be alone and be OK...

1465
01:19:13,128 --> 01:19:14,588
but I was.

1466
01:19:14,588 --> 01:19:16,423
I am good!

1467
01:19:16,423 --> 01:19:19,426
When I finished writing,
I let Jeanine read it.

1468
01:19:25,098 --> 01:19:26,600
She loved it.

1469
01:19:26,600 --> 01:19:29,603
I love it!
This is so good!

1470
01:19:29,603 --> 01:19:31,480
She really loved it.

1471
01:19:31,480 --> 01:19:34,858
I wasn't sure anyone else
would like it the way she did...

1472
01:19:34,858 --> 01:19:37,611
but Jeanine was positive
it could get published...

1473
01:19:37,611 --> 01:19:40,864
so I just let her take care
of the details.

1474
01:19:40,864 --> 01:19:43,116
The tables
had really turned...

1475
01:19:43,116 --> 01:19:45,452
because now she was
giving me career advice.

1476
01:19:45,452 --> 01:19:48,789
I waited patiently
for some response to my work.

1477
01:19:50,374 --> 01:19:52,668
Finally, I got my first call.

1478
01:19:57,631 --> 01:19:58,632
Hello?

1479
01:19:58,632 --> 01:19:59,633
Hi.

1480
01:19:59,633 --> 01:20:00,759
Who's this?

1481
01:20:00,759 --> 01:20:02,052
It's me. Harry.

1482
01:20:03,637 --> 01:20:04,638
Oh!

1483
01:20:04,638 --> 01:20:07,099
Wow! You sound different.

1484
01:20:07,099 --> 01:20:08,517
I'm...

1485
01:20:09,852 --> 01:20:12,187
I'm older.
I had a birthday.

1486
01:20:12,187 --> 01:20:14,773
Yeah. I got you a card.

1487
01:20:14,773 --> 01:20:16,733
I didn't get it.

1488
01:20:16,733 --> 01:20:18,569
I didn't mail it.

1489
01:20:18,569 --> 01:20:19,570
Oh.

1490
01:20:21,363 --> 01:20:25,325
Listen, I read your thing.

1491
01:20:25,325 --> 01:20:26,869
What thing?

1492
01:20:26,869 --> 01:20:28,662
Your story.

1493
01:20:28,662 --> 01:20:33,208
You know..."Still Life
in Summit Bluff."

1494
01:20:33,208 --> 01:20:35,335
How did you get ahold of...

1495
01:20:35,335 --> 01:20:37,671
Jeanine thought
I should read it.

1496
01:20:37,671 --> 01:20:39,715
That little bitch.

1497
01:20:39,715 --> 01:20:40,883
Bitch?

1498
01:20:40,883 --> 01:20:42,676
You never swore.

1499
01:20:42,676 --> 01:20:45,929
I'm doing a lot of things
that I never did before.

1500
01:20:45,929 --> 01:20:47,890
I am, too.

1501
01:20:47,890 --> 01:20:51,435
By the way, I finally
took your advice.

1502
01:20:51,435 --> 01:20:53,562
You opened your own practice?

1503
01:20:53,562 --> 01:20:55,939
In Sausalito. I'm even
making house calls now.

1504
01:20:55,939 --> 01:20:58,192
That's great!

1505
01:20:58,192 --> 01:21:00,068
Yeah.

1506
01:21:00,068 --> 01:21:01,445
Harry?

1507
01:21:01,445 --> 01:21:03,030
Yeah?

1508
01:21:04,531 --> 01:21:07,409
What did you think of my story?

1509
01:21:07,409 --> 01:21:08,911
I loved it.

1510
01:21:08,911 --> 01:21:10,120
You did?

1511
01:21:10,120 --> 01:21:12,331
Yeah, I did,
especially that part...

1512
01:21:12,331 --> 01:21:14,625
where the idiot doctor
neglected his wife...

1513
01:21:14,625 --> 01:21:17,836
and drove her into the arms
of his cousin.

1514
01:21:17,836 --> 01:21:20,172
I mean, that part...

1515
01:21:22,633 --> 01:21:23,800
Marjorie...

1516
01:21:23,800 --> 01:21:25,344
Yeah?

1517
01:21:25,344 --> 01:21:27,846
I owe you an apology.

1518
01:21:27,846 --> 01:21:29,640
You owe me?

1519
01:21:29,640 --> 01:21:31,141
Yeah.

1520
01:21:31,141 --> 01:21:34,228
Harry, I betrayed you.
I had the affair.

1521
01:21:34,228 --> 01:21:36,688
I wasn't much of a husband.

1522
01:21:36,688 --> 01:21:39,983
I know, but I could have
said something.

1523
01:21:39,983 --> 01:21:41,902
I probably wouldn't
have heard you.

1524
01:21:41,902 --> 01:21:43,946
I guess it's just lucky
you finally wrote it.

1525
01:21:43,946 --> 01:21:47,491
Yeah. It's getting
terrific response.

1526
01:21:47,491 --> 01:21:49,159
I'm not surprised.

1527
01:21:49,159 --> 01:21:51,537
Who have you heard from?

1528
01:21:52,829 --> 01:21:53,914
You.

1529
01:21:55,832 --> 01:21:57,167
Marjorie, do you think...

1530
01:21:57,167 --> 01:21:59,670
that maybe
we could get together...

1531
01:21:59,670 --> 01:22:01,672
and talk about things?

1532
01:22:05,801 --> 01:22:08,637
I guess so.

1533
01:22:08,637 --> 01:22:10,013
When?

1534
01:22:13,642 --> 01:22:15,102
Soon.

1535
01:22:17,813 --> 01:22:19,648
Soon.

1536
01:22:19,648 --> 01:22:23,151
Can I call you?

1537
01:22:23,151 --> 01:22:25,654
Yeah, sure, if you want to.

1538
01:22:25,654 --> 01:22:28,615
OK, then... I'll call you.

1539
01:22:29,992 --> 01:22:30,993
OK.

1540
01:22:34,830 --> 01:22:35,914
Bye.

1541
01:22:35,914 --> 01:22:36,999
Bye.

1542
01:22:40,169 --> 01:22:41,670
Marjorie!

1543
01:22:45,966 --> 01:22:47,301
Harry?

1544
01:22:47,301 --> 01:22:49,678
You said I could call.

1545
01:23:03,525 --> 01:23:04,943
I like your beard.

1546
01:23:04,943 --> 01:23:06,778
Thanks.

1547
01:23:06,778 --> 01:23:09,448
You look like
you did in school.

1548
01:23:11,617 --> 01:23:13,202
So do you.

1549
01:23:18,874 --> 01:23:20,375
Can I come in?

1550
01:23:20,375 --> 01:23:22,377
Yeah.

1551
01:23:22,377 --> 01:23:24,379
Yeah.

1552
01:23:28,258 --> 01:23:29,676
Harry...

1553
01:23:31,470 --> 01:23:33,555
Yeah?

1554
01:23:33,555 --> 01:23:35,516
How's your heart?
