1
00:02:51,232 --> 00:03:04,232


2
00:03:10,262 --> 00:03:12,490
All were transported?

3
00:03:12,531 --> 00:03:13,531
Almost.

4
00:03:14,499 --> 00:03:16,297
Almost.

5
00:03:17,236 --> 00:03:20,500
Sir with all the respect,
you sure this is the best option?

6
00:03:20,572 --> 00:03:21,364
Why dont we
just correct...

7
00:03:21,373 --> 00:03:24,432
Because my faking nephew...

8
00:03:25,311 --> 00:03:26,437
Killed the dog.

9
00:03:28,314 --> 00:03:30,339
He stole a car.

10
00:03:31,283 --> 00:03:32,375
A car...

11
00:03:34,419 --> 00:03:37,887
Which currently is
among our inventory.

12
00:03:40,892 --> 00:03:44,461
So, we are giving
everything up... for a car?

13
00:03:45,691 --> 00:03:47,925
Its not just a car...

14
00:03:48,794 --> 00:03:50,921
It is John Wick car.

15
00:03:59,839 --> 00:04:02,808
So... why just dont give it back?

16
00:04:03,975 --> 00:04:05,842
He killed my nephew.

17
00:04:07,479 --> 00:04:08,903
My brother.

18
00:04:10,749 --> 00:04:12,842
A dozen of my men.

19
00:04:14,753 --> 00:04:16,778
Over his car.

20
00:04:17,889 --> 00:04:19,823
And a puppy.

21
00:04:22,694 --> 00:04:27,722
You think he will stop now?

22
00:04:30,736 --> 00:04:32,761
Sir, he is one man.

23
00:04:33,289 --> 00:04:34,483
Why we just eliminate him?

24
00:04:39,328 --> 00:04:40,386
John Wick...

25
00:04:41,297 --> 00:04:43,390
Is a man on focus...

26
00:04:47,403 --> 00:04:48,703
Commitment...

27
00:04:55,444 --> 00:04:58,646
And a faking will!

28
00:05:13,529 --> 00:05:16,498
He once killed three
men in a bar...

29
00:05:16,499 --> 00:05:18,496
With a pencil.
I know. I've heard the story.

30
00:05:18,501 --> 00:05:20,529
With a faking Pencil!

31
00:05:21,503 --> 00:05:23,494
Who the fak can do that?

32
00:05:26,275 --> 00:05:27,334
I can assure you...

33
00:05:29,378 --> 00:05:32,438
That the stories you
hear about this man...

34
00:05:33,415 --> 00:05:39,513
if nothing else,
has been ###### down.

35
00:05:54,436 --> 00:05:57,395
You have my car...

36
00:06:02,344 --> 00:06:04,245
THE BOOGEYMAN.

37
00:12:16,319 --> 00:12:18,445
Peace.

38
00:12:19,454 --> 00:12:24,391
Can a man like you know peace?

39
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:27,490
Why not?

40
00:12:34,303 --> 00:12:36,463
Peace.

41
00:12:48,449 --> 00:12:50,384
Enjoy your retirement...

42
00:12:51,419 --> 00:12:52,419
Mr. Wick.

43
00:15:39,387 --> 00:15:40,445
Good dog.

44
00:15:56,338 --> 00:15:57,332
<i>What are you doing, John?</i>

45
00:15:58,339 --> 00:15:59,302
<i>Looking at you.</i>

46
00:15:59,474 --> 00:16:02,534
<i>- What are you doing?
- I'm waiting for you.</i>

47
00:16:03,411 --> 00:16:04,435
<i>Come here.</i>

48
00:16:19,362 --> 00:16:21,330
Hey, boy.

49
00:16:46,521 --> 00:16:48,489
Nice peaceful place you got here.

50
00:16:49,524 --> 00:16:51,515
- Hey, Aurelio.
- Hey.

51
00:16:55,264 --> 00:16:58,324
John, what the hell?
I thought you loved this car.

52
00:16:59,402 --> 00:17:01,426
What do you think?

53
00:17:02,503 --> 00:17:04,495
The motor is about to fall out...

54
00:17:05,340 --> 00:17:06,340
The chassis is all bent up...

55
00:17:07,442 --> 00:17:09,467
The drive shaft is all destroyed.

56
00:17:09,477 --> 00:17:12,275
And I dont know if you noticed,
but you have a crack in the windshield.

57
00:17:13,547 --> 00:17:15,278
I mean...
what do I think?

58
00:17:17,285 --> 00:17:18,411
I can fix it.

59
00:17:19,321 --> 00:17:21,447
Thank for finding her.

60
00:17:21,556 --> 00:17:23,490
Not a problem, man.
I just made a few calls.

61
00:17:23,491 --> 00:17:24,491
Not a big deal.

62
00:17:27,462 --> 00:17:29,362
Let me know when its fixed.

63
00:17:29,531 --> 00:17:30,362
Alright.

64
00:17:31,799 --> 00:17:33,390
This car will be ready by Christmas...

65
00:17:33,468 --> 00:17:34,333
20th-30th

66
00:19:14,435 --> 00:19:15,459
Ciao, John.

67
00:19:16,538 --> 00:19:18,369
Santino.

68
00:19:23,279 --> 00:19:25,405
May I come in?

69
00:19:27,482 --> 00:19:29,540
Of course.

70
00:19:36,524 --> 00:19:37,524
Coffee?

71
00:19:38,526 --> 00:19:39,526
Grazie.

72
00:19:44,465 --> 00:19:45,465
Good to see you.

73
00:19:46,434 --> 00:19:47,434
Good to see... you.

74
00:20:07,289 --> 00:20:10,315
I was sorry to hear
about your wife, John.

75
00:20:12,427 --> 00:20:13,485
Thank you.

76
00:20:19,534 --> 00:20:22,503
And the dog...
Does he have a name?

77
00:20:23,438 --> 00:20:24,496
No.

78
00:20:33,548 --> 00:20:35,413
Listen, John...

79
00:20:36,451 --> 00:20:37,451
with all sincerity...

80
00:20:39,487 --> 00:20:40,911
I do not want to be here.

81
00:20:40,989 --> 00:20:42,280
Please... dont.

82
00:20:43,524 --> 00:20:45,322
I'm asking you not to do this.

83
00:20:46,527 --> 00:20:47,527
I'm sorry.

84
00:20:52,467 --> 00:20:53,525
No one...

85
00:20:54,369 --> 00:20:56,403
Gets out and comes back...

86
00:20:56,404 --> 00:20:58,271
without repercussions.

87
00:21:00,408 --> 00:21:03,242
I did this with a heavy heart, John.

88
00:21:06,381 --> 00:21:07,507
But remember...

89
00:21:08,316 --> 00:21:10,341
If not for what they did...

90
00:21:10,451 --> 00:21:12,386
on the night,
of your impossible task...

91
00:21:13,454 --> 00:21:16,356
You would not be here right now,
like this.

92
00:21:17,425 --> 00:21:19,326
This... is because of me.

93
00:21:20,428 --> 00:21:22,453
This in part is mine.

94
00:21:22,731 --> 00:21:24,491
Take it back.

95
00:21:25,333 --> 00:21:27,301
- Take it back?
- Take it back.

96
00:21:27,435 --> 00:21:30,461
A marker is not a simple thing, John.

97
00:21:31,372 --> 00:21:34,341
For a man to grand a
mark on to another...

98
00:21:34,509 --> 00:21:37,343
It's the bind of
soul and blood oath.

99
00:21:41,382 --> 00:21:43,407
Find someone else.

100
00:21:46,322 --> 00:21:47,680
Listen to me!

101
00:21:48,456 --> 00:21:49,456
What is it?

102
00:21:50,525 --> 00:21:51,525
Do you remember?

103
00:21:52,393 --> 00:21:53,393
This is your blood.

104
00:21:54,462 --> 00:21:55,462
You came to me.

105
00:21:56,364 --> 00:21:57,364
I helped you.

106
00:21:58,466 --> 00:22:00,400
If you dont do this...

107
00:22:01,369 --> 00:22:04,395
You know the consequences.

108
00:22:05,473 --> 00:22:08,340
I'm not that guy anymore.

109
00:22:12,347 --> 00:22:14,372
You're always that guy, John.

110
00:22:18,519 --> 00:22:20,487
I cant help you.

111
00:22:32,433 --> 00:22:33,433
I'm sorry.

112
00:22:47,315 --> 00:22:49,250
Yes.
You're right.

113
00:22:50,518 --> 00:22:51,518
You cant.

114
00:22:55,390 --> 00:22:56,516
But he can.

115
00:22:57,325 --> 00:22:59,259
See you soon, John.

116
00:23:10,305 --> 00:23:12,330
You have a beautiful home, John.

117
00:26:02,485 --> 00:26:04,476
I would like to
see the manager.

118
00:26:05,254 --> 00:26:07,246
How good to see you again so soon,
Mr. Wick.

119
00:26:08,424 --> 00:26:09,424
Shall I announce you?

120
00:26:10,493 --> 00:26:12,393
Yes please.

121
00:26:13,329 --> 00:26:14,421
Stay.

122
00:26:22,438 --> 00:26:25,339
Mr. Wick is on his way
to see you, sir.

123
00:26:38,388 --> 00:26:39,514
Impeccable.

124
00:26:41,557 --> 00:26:45,357
Put this in the circulation.

125
00:26:58,408 --> 00:27:00,239
Where is he?

126
00:27:01,444 --> 00:27:03,275
Thank you my friend.

127
00:27:03,413 --> 00:27:06,280
Beautiful work.

128
00:27:12,522 --> 00:27:15,252
What are you doing, Jonathan?

129
00:27:15,558 --> 00:27:18,254
He burnt my house.

130
00:27:18,294 --> 00:27:22,230
You rejected his mark.
You're lucky he stopped there.

131
00:27:22,532 --> 00:27:24,329
What the hell were you thinking?

132
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:27,335
Giving a mark to a man
as Santino D'Antonio?

133
00:27:27,403 --> 00:27:29,462
He was the only way
I could get out.

134
00:27:31,374 --> 00:27:33,342
You call this out?

135
00:27:34,444 --> 00:27:36,469
What did you think
was gonna happen?

136
00:27:36,546 --> 00:27:38,411
What did you expect?

137
00:27:38,481 --> 00:27:42,508
Did you really think this
day was never going to come?

138
00:27:44,487 --> 00:27:46,455
What does he want you to do?

139
00:27:48,458 --> 00:27:50,323
I did not ask.

140
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:52,428
I just said no.

141
00:27:55,364 --> 00:27:58,424
Two rules that cannot be broken,
Jonathan.

142
00:27:58,534 --> 00:28:00,479
No blood on Continental grounds,

143
00:28:00,503 --> 00:28:03,301
and every marker
must be honored.

144
00:28:04,273 --> 00:28:08,334
My judgment come in the full
move of ex-communicado...

145
00:28:08,377 --> 00:28:10,242
The high table...

146
00:28:10,313 --> 00:28:14,340
they had their traditions
if you refuse...

147
00:28:15,318 --> 00:28:17,343
I have no choice?

148
00:28:18,354 --> 00:28:20,379
You dishonored the mark, you die.

149
00:28:20,423 --> 00:28:22,414
You kill the owner of the mark,
you die.

150
00:28:22,425 --> 00:28:25,292
You run, you die.

151
00:28:26,295 --> 00:28:28,422
This is what you've agreed to, Jonathan.

152
00:28:29,365 --> 00:28:31,424
Do what ever he asks.

153
00:28:32,368 --> 00:28:33,460
Be free.

154
00:28:34,303 --> 00:28:36,430
Then, if you want to go after him...

155
00:28:36,472 --> 00:28:38,303
Burn his house down...

156
00:28:38,341 --> 00:28:40,434
Be my guest.
But until then...

157
00:28:42,545 --> 00:28:44,445
Rules!

158
00:28:45,348 --> 00:28:47,543
Exactly.
Rules.

159
00:28:48,317 --> 00:28:50,444
Without them,
we would live with the animals.

160
00:28:58,494 --> 00:29:00,519
Do you take animals?

161
00:29:01,464 --> 00:29:03,364
I am sorry to say that,

162
00:29:03,432 --> 00:29:05,366
but this facility does not!

163
00:29:06,369 --> 00:29:11,306
I however... would be willing
to accept the responsibility...

164
00:29:11,340 --> 00:29:12,432
As you wish.

165
00:29:13,509 --> 00:29:15,272
Appreciate that.

166
00:29:15,344 --> 00:29:16,504
Does he have a name, sir?

167
00:29:17,313 --> 00:29:18,313
No.

168
00:29:19,282 --> 00:29:20,340
Good dog.

169
00:29:20,416 --> 00:29:21,416
Stay.

170
00:30:25,314 --> 00:30:28,374
This was my fathers collection.

171
00:30:29,318 --> 00:30:33,345
I see a little more, not that
just paint on canvas of course.

172
00:30:35,324 --> 00:30:37,349
But I do find myself here.

173
00:30:39,262 --> 00:30:40,354
Please...

174
00:30:53,376 --> 00:30:55,344
I didnt want you to do this,
John.

175
00:30:55,478 --> 00:30:57,309
If you had retired...

176
00:30:57,413 --> 00:30:59,278
I would've respected it.

177
00:31:01,384 --> 00:31:02,476
Look at you.

178
00:31:03,419 --> 00:31:06,320
You are thinking about it,
arent you?

179
00:31:06,522 --> 00:31:08,490
You counting exits...

180
00:31:09,492 --> 00:31:10,516
Guards...

181
00:31:12,361 --> 00:31:14,420
Could you get to me in time?

182
00:31:16,365 --> 00:31:18,356
How would you do it,
I wonder...

183
00:31:20,403 --> 00:31:22,303
That woman's pen?

184
00:31:24,273 --> 00:31:25,331
His cane?

185
00:31:27,376 --> 00:31:28,502
Maybe his glasses?

186
00:31:29,445 --> 00:31:32,243
My hands.

187
00:31:34,350 --> 00:31:36,250
How exiting.

188
00:31:36,419 --> 00:31:38,410
Yet you know you cannot, can you?

189
00:31:39,422 --> 00:31:43,256
I told you... I needed that guy!

190
00:31:43,392 --> 00:31:46,293
The way you are looking
at me right now.

191
00:31:46,529 --> 00:31:48,463
I needed THE BOOGEYMAN.

192
00:31:49,398 --> 00:31:51,457
I needed John Wick.

193
00:31:52,268 --> 00:31:54,395
Just tell me what you want...

194
00:31:59,342 --> 00:32:01,469
I want you to kill my sister.

195
00:32:03,479 --> 00:32:04,479
Why?

196
00:32:05,414 --> 00:32:08,542
There are 12 seats
at the high table.

197
00:32:10,319 --> 00:32:13,311
Camorra, the Mafia Ndrangheta.

198
00:32:14,490 --> 00:32:16,481
Chinese, the Russian...

199
00:32:18,260 --> 00:32:19,454
When my father died...

200
00:32:21,464 --> 00:32:24,262
He willed a sit to her.

201
00:32:25,401 --> 00:32:27,494
She represents Camorra now.

202
00:32:28,371 --> 00:32:30,532
And I cant tell but wonder...

203
00:32:32,341 --> 00:32:35,310
What I might accomplishing instead...

204
00:32:36,412 --> 00:32:39,279
You want me to kill...

205
00:32:39,448 --> 00:32:42,440
Gianna D'Antonio?

206
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:46,283
I could never did.

207
00:32:46,522 --> 00:32:48,353
She is my blood.

208
00:32:48,491 --> 00:32:50,254
I still love her.

209
00:32:50,493 --> 00:32:53,485
- It cant be done.
- She is in Rome.

210
00:32:54,397 --> 00:32:56,456
For her coronation.

211
00:32:57,266 --> 00:33:01,396
- You will take the catacombs...
- It does not matter where she is.

212
00:33:01,404 --> 00:33:03,429
That's why...

213
00:33:03,472 --> 00:33:07,306
I need a Ghost,
John Wick.

214
00:33:07,476 --> 00:33:09,501
That's why I need you.

215
00:33:10,479 --> 00:33:12,344
Do this for me...

216
00:33:12,515 --> 00:33:14,483
And your marker is honored.

217
00:33:16,352 --> 00:33:18,252
What say you?

218
00:33:25,428 --> 00:33:27,396
Never want to waste words.

219
00:33:44,280 --> 00:33:47,340
5903.5.

220
00:34:45,374 --> 00:34:48,434
Happy hunting, Mr. Wick.

221
00:35:35,491 --> 00:35:38,392
Welcome to the Continental of Rome.

222
00:35:38,427 --> 00:35:40,395
How might I be of assistance?

223
00:35:40,429 --> 00:35:42,454
I would like a room.

224
00:35:49,438 --> 00:35:50,462
Jonathan!

225
00:35:52,374 --> 00:35:53,466
Julius.

226
00:35:55,477 --> 00:35:58,241
- Ciao.
- Nice to see you.

227
00:36:03,385 --> 00:36:06,479
I fail to recall the last
time you were in Rome.

228
00:36:07,489 --> 00:36:09,354
And here I heard...

229
00:36:10,292 --> 00:36:11,350
You're retired.

230
00:36:13,262 --> 00:36:14,320
I had.

231
00:36:15,431 --> 00:36:17,399
Then you ll answer me...

232
00:36:17,499 --> 00:36:19,399
One question.

233
00:36:22,438 --> 00:36:25,271
Are you here to kill the Pope?

234
00:36:28,544 --> 00:36:29,544
No.

235
00:36:32,414 --> 00:36:34,348
Alright then.

236
00:36:39,321 --> 00:36:42,449
One of our finest rooms.

237
00:36:47,263 --> 00:36:48,263
Grazie.

238
00:36:49,331 --> 00:36:50,525
Enjoy your stay.

239
00:36:58,374 --> 00:37:00,274
Mr. Wick.

240
00:37:18,494 --> 00:37:20,359
Is the Sommelier in?

241
00:37:20,429 --> 00:37:23,296
I have never known him not to be.

242
00:37:38,380 --> 00:37:40,405
Good afternoon, Mr. Wick.

243
00:37:41,450 --> 00:37:43,315
It's being a long time...

244
00:37:43,352 --> 00:37:44,410
I would like a tasting.

245
00:37:44,453 --> 00:37:48,253
I am quite exciting to show you something

246
00:37:49,291 --> 00:37:50,383
First...

247
00:37:56,332 --> 00:37:58,425
Good morning, Mr. Wick.

248
00:37:58,500 --> 00:37:59,524
Hi, Angela.

249
00:37:59,535 --> 00:38:01,366
Welcome back to Rome.

250
00:38:01,370 --> 00:38:04,237
Would you be in
need of a new suit?

251
00:38:04,273 --> 00:38:05,331
- I am.
- I know...

252
00:38:05,374 --> 00:38:09,333
from your past that you
love the German varietals...

253
00:38:09,378 --> 00:38:13,280
But let me introduce the
latest products from Austria.

254
00:38:13,382 --> 00:38:16,374
Glock 34 mm and 26 mm.

255
00:38:17,353 --> 00:38:20,288
This is the original map
of D'Antonio estate.

256
00:38:20,322 --> 00:38:22,483
Here you have all
the ancient ruins.

257
00:38:25,327 --> 00:38:29,286
Tell me, Mr. Wick,
is this a formal event or social affair?

258
00:38:29,431 --> 00:38:33,265
- Social.
- Is this for Day or Evening?

259
00:38:33,335 --> 00:38:35,326
I need one for day
and one for night.

260
00:38:35,404 --> 00:38:36,530
With control grips.

261
00:38:37,439 --> 00:38:40,499
Flat macwell for easy reloads.

262
00:38:40,542 --> 00:38:43,443
And I know you ll appreciate
the custom porting.

263
00:38:46,315 --> 00:38:47,441
What's next?

264
00:38:47,483 --> 00:38:51,350
I need something robust, precise.

265
00:38:51,386 --> 00:38:53,513
Robust, Precise.

266
00:38:55,324 --> 00:39:00,352
This is the map of the temple
and catacombs underneath.

267
00:39:00,529 --> 00:39:02,429
- And what style?
- Italian.

268
00:39:02,464 --> 00:39:04,398
- How many buttons?
- Two.

269
00:39:04,433 --> 00:39:06,401
- Trousers?
- Tapered.

270
00:39:06,402 --> 00:39:08,233
How about the lining?

271
00:39:08,370 --> 00:39:09,428
Tactical.

272
00:39:10,372 --> 00:39:12,237
AR-15.

273
00:39:12,508 --> 00:39:14,339
11.5 inch.

274
00:39:14,376 --> 00:39:17,368
Reinforced ionic bonds.

275
00:39:17,413 --> 00:39:20,405
With 1-6 magnification.

276
00:39:20,416 --> 00:39:24,443
And this is the modern blueprint.

277
00:39:24,486 --> 00:39:28,320
There are one, two, three gates.

278
00:39:30,292 --> 00:39:31,452
Silicon carbide discs.

279
00:39:31,527 --> 00:39:33,461
Ceramic metrisis.

280
00:39:33,462 --> 00:39:37,364
Laminated.
Body armor.

281
00:39:37,399 --> 00:39:40,493
We just sew it between
the fabric and the lining.

282
00:39:40,502 --> 00:39:42,493
Zero penetration.

283
00:39:42,538 --> 00:39:44,438
However...

284
00:39:44,540 --> 00:39:46,405
Quite painful I am afraid.

285
00:39:46,442 --> 00:39:50,276
Could you recommend anything
for the end the night?

286
00:39:50,312 --> 00:39:52,303
Something big...

287
00:39:52,448 --> 00:39:53,506
May I suggest...

288
00:39:54,316 --> 00:39:56,341
The Benelli M4.

289
00:40:00,255 --> 00:40:02,416
Custom bolt carrier release
and charging handle.

290
00:40:02,524 --> 00:40:04,321
Textured grips.

291
00:40:04,393 --> 00:40:06,520
If your hands get... wet.

292
00:40:09,331 --> 00:40:11,299
An Italian classic.

293
00:40:11,467 --> 00:40:12,467
Dessert?

294
00:40:13,502 --> 00:40:15,265
Dessert.

295
00:40:15,437 --> 00:40:18,235
The finest cutlery.

296
00:40:18,307 --> 00:40:20,298
Fresh-sharpened.

297
00:40:29,051 --> 00:40:30,343
Well done.

298
00:40:30,352 --> 00:40:33,219
- Could you do a rush order?
- I sure can

299
00:40:33,255 --> 00:40:35,366
- Where do you like it to have it sent?
- The Hotel.

300
00:40:35,390 --> 00:40:37,449
Should I have everything
sent to your room?

301
00:40:38,327 --> 00:40:38,866
Yes.

302
00:40:38,896 --> 00:40:41,319
- Thank you.
- Excellent.

303
00:40:41,563 --> 00:40:43,326
Mr. Wick?

304
00:40:46,535 --> 00:40:49,231
Do enjoy your party!

305
00:44:43,405 --> 00:44:44,497
Good evening.

306
00:44:45,373 --> 00:44:47,341
Are you enjoying the party?

307
00:44:47,375 --> 00:44:48,535
Excuse me, miss.

308
00:44:49,277 --> 00:44:51,336
Mr. Akon is waiting.

309
00:44:52,380 --> 00:44:53,506
In a moment.

310
00:45:35,323 --> 00:45:36,483
Mr. Akon.

311
00:45:42,264 --> 00:45:44,391
Are you enjoying the festivities?

312
00:45:45,300 --> 00:45:48,269
Thank you for seeing me.

313
00:45:48,336 --> 00:45:50,429
Please sit.

314
00:45:54,442 --> 00:45:55,500
Miss D'Antonio...

315
00:45:56,378 --> 00:46:00,280
- You cant just take what is ri...
- Nothing was taken.

316
00:46:01,283 --> 00:46:04,275
Those among your own came
to us with these territories.

317
00:46:04,319 --> 00:46:06,412
A knife was pressed
in their throats.

318
00:46:06,521 --> 00:46:08,386
Semantics.

319
00:46:09,324 --> 00:46:10,484
Besides...

320
00:46:11,293 --> 00:46:14,490
That blade you speak of was
meant for their children.

321
00:46:15,497 --> 00:46:18,398
They were only meant to watch.

322
00:46:19,334 --> 00:46:21,393
What is yours is now ours...

323
00:46:21,469 --> 00:46:23,437
Mr Akon.

324
00:46:25,273 --> 00:46:26,467
Now go.

325
00:46:29,377 --> 00:46:31,311
Enjoy the party.

326
00:46:32,314 --> 00:46:34,248
Have some fun.

327
00:46:39,287 --> 00:46:42,222
Why dont you go to
entertain our guests...

328
00:46:42,290 --> 00:46:44,281
while I freshen up my makeup.

329
00:46:45,293 --> 00:46:46,487
Okay, Signora.

330
00:46:51,333 --> 00:46:53,460
What could I do without you,
Cassian?

331
00:47:06,490 --> 00:47:11,790


332
00:47:32,407 --> 00:47:33,499
John.

333
00:47:35,443 --> 00:47:37,308
Gianna.

334
00:47:43,285 --> 00:47:47,244
There was a time not so long ago
we considered us...

335
00:47:47,322 --> 00:47:48,550
As friends.

336
00:47:52,299 --> 00:47:53,493
I still do.

337
00:47:59,501 --> 00:48:01,469
Deaths very emissary...

338
00:48:05,407 --> 00:48:07,466
What brought you back, John?

339
00:48:09,311 --> 00:48:11,245
A marker.

340
00:48:12,447 --> 00:48:14,312
By...?

341
00:48:16,251 --> 00:48:17,445
Your Brother.

342
00:48:25,393 --> 00:48:26,451
Tell me, John...

343
00:48:27,429 --> 00:48:29,454
This marker...

344
00:48:30,432 --> 00:48:32,491
Is it how you go out?

345
00:48:34,536 --> 00:48:36,470
And what was her name...?

346
00:48:37,272 --> 00:48:40,298
This woman whose life
has ended on my own?

347
00:48:42,344 --> 00:48:43,436
Helen.

348
00:48:44,412 --> 00:48:45,470
Helen.

349
00:48:48,550 --> 00:48:50,518
This Helen...

350
00:48:52,354 --> 00:48:55,517
was she worth the price
that now you see to pay?

351
00:49:02,330 --> 00:49:03,422
Now...

352
00:49:06,368 --> 00:49:09,269
let me tell you what
happens when I die.

353
00:49:09,504 --> 00:49:13,372
Santino ll claim my sit on the table.

354
00:49:14,376 --> 00:49:16,503
He will take New York.

355
00:49:18,313 --> 00:49:19,439
And you...

356
00:49:20,315 --> 00:49:22,510
Will be the one who gift it to him.

357
00:50:12,534 --> 00:50:16,265
What would Helen
think about that john?

358
00:50:34,422 --> 00:50:37,323
What would Helen
think about you?

359
00:50:54,342 --> 00:50:55,400
Why?

360
00:51:01,318 --> 00:51:06,344
Because...
I lived my live in my way.

361
00:51:07,355 --> 00:51:10,290
And I ll die in my way.

362
00:51:24,372 --> 00:51:27,432
Do you fear domination, John?

363
00:51:29,377 --> 00:51:31,242
Yes.

364
00:51:37,352 --> 00:51:38,478
You know...

365
00:51:39,420 --> 00:51:43,413
I always thought
I could escape it.

366
00:51:44,492 --> 00:51:47,427
That I would see it coming...

367
00:51:50,431 --> 00:51:53,264
That I would see you.

368
00:53:05,306 --> 00:53:07,274
John?

369
00:53:12,280 --> 00:53:13,508
Cassian.

370
00:53:16,284 --> 00:53:17,478
You work here?

371
00:53:19,420 --> 00:53:21,251
Yeah.

372
00:53:21,581 --> 00:53:24,281
- You?
- Yeah.

373
00:53:28,429 --> 00:53:30,329
Good night?

374
00:53:32,500 --> 00:53:34,468
I am afraid so...

375
00:53:36,304 --> 00:53:38,272
I'm sorry to hear that.

376
00:53:50,385 --> 00:53:52,285
Get him!

377
00:56:39,353 --> 00:56:41,412
Loose ends?

378
00:56:44,425 --> 00:56:48,293
Just one.

379
00:56:48,329 --> 00:56:49,329
Yeah...

380
01:01:11,392 --> 01:01:13,417
Are you having a good night,
arent you John?

381
01:03:39,406 --> 01:03:40,406
Gentlemen!

382
01:03:42,276 --> 01:03:43,504
Gentlemen!

383
01:03:55,422 --> 01:03:57,481
Do I need to remind you...

384
01:03:57,491 --> 01:04:01,484
There will be no business contacted
on the continental grounds?

385
01:04:03,364 --> 01:04:04,524
No senior.

386
01:04:05,532 --> 01:04:07,329
No sir.

387
01:04:10,371 --> 01:04:15,434
Now may I suggest...
a visit to the bar.

388
01:04:16,310 --> 01:04:18,301
So you calm yourselves.

389
01:04:20,514 --> 01:04:24,348
Gin, wasnt it?

390
01:04:24,986 --> 01:04:26,286
Yes.

391
01:04:27,421 --> 01:04:28,445
Bourbon?

392
01:04:29,356 --> 01:04:30,356
Right?

393
01:04:31,392 --> 01:04:32,450
Yeah.

394
01:04:43,470 --> 01:04:44,494
Thanks.

395
01:04:44,538 --> 01:04:46,506
Grazie.

396
01:04:59,353 --> 01:05:01,253
I have a marker.

397
01:05:02,523 --> 01:05:03,523
Whose?

398
01:05:05,326 --> 01:05:06,384
Her brother...

399
01:05:11,465 --> 01:05:12,465
I see.

400
01:05:14,401 --> 01:05:16,426
You had no choice.

401
01:05:21,342 --> 01:05:23,401
He wants her sit in the table.

402
01:05:24,511 --> 01:05:26,411
He will get it now.

403
01:05:29,383 --> 01:05:30,407
Yeah.

404
01:05:32,353 --> 01:05:33,445
Yeah.

405
01:05:36,390 --> 01:05:38,290
So you're free.

406
01:05:44,431 --> 01:05:45,431
Am I?

407
01:05:48,369 --> 01:05:49,369
No.

408
01:05:51,271 --> 01:05:52,397
Not at all.

409
01:05:55,376 --> 01:05:57,241
You killed my "buddy".

410
01:05:57,478 --> 01:05:59,378
Someone I was close to.

411
01:06:01,382 --> 01:06:04,283
An Eye for an eye, John.

412
01:06:05,319 --> 01:06:06,377
You know how it goes...

413
01:06:09,523 --> 01:06:10,523
Yeah.

414
01:06:16,330 --> 01:06:17,456
I'll make it quick.

415
01:06:19,533 --> 01:06:20,533
I promise.

416
01:06:22,403 --> 01:06:24,462
I appreciate that.

417
01:06:25,372 --> 01:06:27,533
I will try to do the same...

418
01:06:37,317 --> 01:06:38,511
This round is on me.

419
01:06:41,388 --> 01:06:44,323
Consider it a professional courtesy.

420
01:07:08,353 --> 01:07:11,353
<i>Having a tough night?</i>

421
01:07:14,383 --> 01:07:17,383
<i>Can I buy a drink?</i>

422
01:07:17,991 --> 01:07:18,858
No.

423
01:07:18,959 --> 01:07:20,290
Thanks.

424
01:08:22,523 --> 01:08:23,523
Hello, John.

425
01:08:24,458 --> 01:08:27,222
I understand if you're upset.

426
01:08:27,427 --> 01:08:30,294
And I know it might
feel personal.

427
01:08:30,297 --> 01:08:32,356
But what kind of man would I be.

428
01:08:32,399 --> 01:08:34,526
If I did not avenge my sisters murder.

429
01:08:35,935 --> 01:08:37,265
John?

430
01:08:54,288 --> 01:08:57,485
Could you let management know I ll
be checking out in the morning.

431
01:09:35,495 --> 01:09:37,395
Operator.

432
01:09:37,397 --> 01:09:39,065
What can I do for you?

433
01:09:39,199 --> 01:09:41,299
- Bank DeVo.
- One moment please.

434
01:09:53,413 --> 01:09:55,506
How can I help you?

435
01:09:55,515 --> 01:09:58,484
- I would like to open an account.
- Name for the account?

436
01:09:58,518 --> 01:10:00,315
John Wick.

437
01:10:00,320 --> 01:10:01,378
Verification?

438
01:10:01,421 --> 01:10:03,286
930-05.

439
01:10:04,391 --> 01:10:08,350
- State of contract?
- Open.

440
01:10:08,395 --> 01:10:09,487
Denomination?

441
01:10:11,298 --> 01:10:12,322
$ 7,000,000.

442
01:10:12,432 --> 01:10:14,400
Processing, please hold.

443
01:10:17,538 --> 01:10:20,329
- I appreciate the service.
- My pleasure.

444
01:10:20,440 --> 01:10:23,409
You will find a safe passage below.

445
01:10:25,412 --> 01:10:29,280
Transportation is waiting for you.

446
01:10:30,317 --> 01:10:33,844
May you have a safe journey,
Mr. Wick.

447
01:12:05,512 --> 01:12:07,377
Order confirmed.

448
01:12:10,384 --> 01:12:11,408
What is this?

449
01:12:11,518 --> 01:12:13,452
He completed the task.

450
01:12:13,487 --> 01:12:16,455
The marker... is over.

451
01:12:16,456 --> 01:12:18,424
Marker?

452
01:12:19,259 --> 01:12:21,454
If Mr. Wick is not dead already...

453
01:12:22,295 --> 01:12:25,389
He soon will be.

454
01:12:25,532 --> 01:12:28,501
You mark it, sir.

455
01:12:41,481 --> 01:12:44,450
You have no idea.

456
01:12:44,484 --> 01:12:47,453
Whats coming to you.

457
01:12:48,255 --> 01:12:51,281
I have everyone in New
York looking for him.

458
01:12:51,358 --> 01:12:52,484
I doubt...

459
01:12:52,526 --> 01:12:54,357
We ll see him again.

460
01:12:56,396 --> 01:12:57,420
Really?

461
01:12:59,499 --> 01:13:01,524
You stabbed the devil in the back.

462
01:13:02,369 --> 01:13:05,497
And force him back into the
life that he had just left.

463
01:13:07,441 --> 01:13:10,239
You've burned the prince temple.

464
01:13:10,377 --> 01:13:12,311
Burn it to the ground.

465
01:13:13,280 --> 01:13:15,441
Now he is free of the marker...

466
01:13:15,515 --> 01:13:17,380
What do you think he will do?

467
01:13:19,520 --> 01:13:23,500
He had a glimpse of the
other side and he embraced it.

468
01:13:24,123 --> 01:13:25,491
But you Mr. Antonio...

469
01:13:27,025 --> 01:13:28,494
Took it away from him.

470
01:13:29,329 --> 01:13:30,387
He was already back.

471
01:13:30,397 --> 01:13:33,332
He came back for love,
not for you.

472
01:13:33,366 --> 01:13:34,390
He owed me.

473
01:13:34,501 --> 01:13:36,298
I had the right.

474
01:13:36,336 --> 01:13:38,304
And now...

475
01:13:38,305 --> 01:13:40,273
He is coming again.

476
01:13:42,075 --> 01:13:43,469
I did tell you not to do this.

477
01:13:47,181 --> 01:13:48,481
He did warn you.

478
01:13:48,548 --> 01:13:51,381
Adios, Antonio.

479
01:17:41,481 --> 01:17:42,481
Stop.

480
01:17:55,395 --> 01:18:00,298
<i>Please let MTA personnel in the
event of suspicious activity.</i>

481
01:18:55,455 --> 01:18:57,446
<i>Canal Street.</i>

482
01:18:59,325 --> 01:19:03,318
<i>You're on the train C Broad Street.</i>

483
01:19:03,329 --> 01:19:05,490
<i>Next stop, Rector Street.</i>

484
01:21:12,025 --> 01:21:14,359
The blade is in your aortic artery.

485
01:21:14,360 --> 01:21:17,329
You pull it out,
you will bleed and you will die.

486
01:21:22,736 --> 01:21:25,361
Consider this a professional courtesy.

487
01:22:07,480 --> 01:22:10,347
If you see anything suspicious...

488
01:22:10,350 --> 01:22:14,309
What you see is the nightmare man.

489
01:22:22,428 --> 01:22:25,295
Take me to him.

490
01:22:27,467 --> 01:22:30,334
Tell him it's John Wick.

491
01:22:45,418 --> 01:22:50,412
Did you know that the
put it in everything.

492
01:24:41,400 --> 01:24:43,459
As I live and breath!

493
01:24:44,403 --> 01:24:46,337
John Wick.

494
01:24:46,372 --> 01:24:48,665
The man.

495
01:24:49,277 --> 01:24:52,277
The myth... the legend.

496
01:24:53,446 --> 01:24:56,313
You are not very good in retiring.

497
01:24:56,449 --> 01:24:58,383
I'm working on it.

498
01:24:59,385 --> 01:25:03,287
Mr. Wick does not remember
but we met many years ago.

499
01:25:03,289 --> 01:25:05,382
Before my aseption...

500
01:25:06,359 --> 01:25:08,452
When I was just a pawn in the game.

501
01:25:10,463 --> 01:25:12,488
We met and you gave me a gift.

502
01:25:12,498 --> 01:25:15,365
The gift that would make me a king.

503
01:25:17,370 --> 01:25:21,306
You do not remember, but there
I was standing in alley...

504
01:25:21,440 --> 01:25:24,307
I did not even hear you coming.

505
01:25:27,343 --> 01:25:31,272
You gave me this.

506
01:25:33,386 --> 01:25:36,321
A gift from THE BOOGEYMAN.

507
01:25:36,355 --> 01:25:39,449
Perfect for every occasion.

508
01:25:41,895 --> 01:25:44,286
But you also gave me a choice.

509
01:25:45,064 --> 01:25:48,495
Pull my gun,
shoot you in the back and die...

510
01:25:48,501 --> 01:25:51,402
or keep the pressure on my neck...

511
01:25:52,471 --> 01:25:54,439
And live.

512
01:25:56,242 --> 01:25:58,335
And so you see, I survived.

513
01:25:59,345 --> 01:26:02,114
No one sneaks up on me anymore.

514
01:26:02,115 --> 01:26:03,407
Thanks to you.

515
01:26:04,283 --> 01:26:06,376
Am all seeing em...

516
01:26:07,253 --> 01:26:08,413
All know em.

517
01:26:09,455 --> 01:26:12,288
Then you know why I am here.

518
01:26:13,459 --> 01:26:16,519
Santino D'Antonio, yeah.

519
01:26:17,363 --> 01:26:19,490
Your contract is gone, John.

520
01:26:20,433 --> 01:26:22,367
That is bad for your health.

521
01:26:23,369 --> 01:26:26,338
What is the number up to now, Earl?

522
01:26:26,339 --> 01:26:29,331
Seven million dollars!

523
01:26:29,375 --> 01:26:30,501
Damn!

524
01:26:31,410 --> 01:26:32,410
It's Christmas.

525
01:26:32,478 --> 01:26:34,469
We are going to
Applebee's after this.

526
01:26:37,516 --> 01:26:39,416
I need your help.

527
01:26:40,353 --> 01:26:43,516
You have eyes begging for change
in every corner of the city.

528
01:26:43,556 --> 01:26:46,491
I am thinking you
could find Santino.

529
01:26:47,360 --> 01:26:49,385
I need you to move me.

530
01:26:49,395 --> 01:26:50,419
Underground.

531
01:26:50,429 --> 01:26:52,294
Get me to him.

532
01:26:52,531 --> 01:26:55,295
Sweet it is!

533
01:26:56,335 --> 01:26:58,462
The BOOGEYMAN begging me for help.

534
01:26:58,504 --> 01:27:00,495
Of course, John.

535
01:27:00,539 --> 01:27:03,269
Whatever you like, John.

536
01:27:03,476 --> 01:27:06,502
Do you like a massage, too, John?

537
01:27:07,313 --> 01:27:09,281
You're going to help me.

538
01:27:09,548 --> 01:27:12,415
Why the fak should I do that?

539
01:27:14,287 --> 01:27:17,256
Because I'm the only
one that can help you.

540
01:27:34,507 --> 01:27:37,271
You are gonna help me out.

541
01:27:37,410 --> 01:27:41,312
You are very good, Mr. Wick.

542
01:27:41,447 --> 01:27:45,247
You sound very positive.

543
01:27:45,551 --> 01:27:47,416
But look around you.

544
01:27:47,520 --> 01:27:51,422
How much help does
it look like I need?

545
01:28:00,266 --> 01:28:03,463
It seems to me that the
real question, Mr. Wick...

546
01:28:04,337 --> 01:28:09,365
Is who in this cruel world
of ours is gonna help you.

547
01:28:23,289 --> 01:28:25,314
There is a storm coming.

548
01:28:25,358 --> 01:28:26,484
Not just for me.

549
01:28:26,525 --> 01:28:28,322
But for all of us.

550
01:28:28,361 --> 01:28:30,454
For everyone under the table.

551
01:28:30,463 --> 01:28:32,688
Yes. Killing someone who has
a sit at the high table...

552
01:28:32,731 --> 01:28:34,499
does create problem.

553
01:28:34,500 --> 01:28:36,365
But its your problem, baby.

554
01:28:36,402 --> 01:28:39,362
After all, none of my people sent...

555
01:28:40,341 --> 01:28:43,467
Gianna D'Antonio...
to the year after.

556
01:28:45,378 --> 01:28:46,504
That been said..

557
01:28:47,313 --> 01:28:49,508
Santino has her sit now.

558
01:28:50,282 --> 01:28:52,307
And he wants the city.

559
01:28:52,451 --> 01:28:56,285
When he is done uptown, do you
think he is gonna stop on the street 14?

560
01:28:56,489 --> 01:28:59,356
We ll just have to
take care of ourselves.

561
01:28:59,358 --> 01:29:00,450
Yeah?

562
01:29:00,559 --> 01:29:02,424
For how long?

563
01:29:03,429 --> 01:29:05,397
And how much blood?

564
01:29:05,431 --> 01:29:07,399
You kill Santino...

565
01:29:07,400 --> 01:29:10,392
The Camorra and the high
table will come for you.

566
01:29:11,370 --> 01:29:13,361
I kill Santino...

567
01:29:13,439 --> 01:29:15,373
They will come for me.

568
01:29:16,275 --> 01:29:19,267
He offered seven million
dollars for your life.

569
01:29:19,412 --> 01:29:24,406
Seven million dollars.
Its a lot of money, Mr. Wick.

570
01:29:30,322 --> 01:29:32,290
So I guess you have a choice.

571
01:29:33,259 --> 01:29:34,453
You want a war?

572
01:29:34,560 --> 01:29:37,529
Or you can just give me a gun?

573
01:29:46,539 --> 01:29:53,274
Somebody!
Please get this man a gun.

574
01:29:59,485 --> 01:30:04,252
Kimber 1911
.45 ACP.

575
01:30:04,490 --> 01:30:07,516
Seven round capacity.

576
01:30:16,268 --> 01:30:18,259
Seven rounds?

577
01:30:18,304 --> 01:30:22,297
Seven million dollars
gets you seven rounds.

578
01:30:23,309 --> 01:30:25,470
Thats a million dollars a round, baby.

579
01:30:37,323 --> 01:30:38,323
Lets go.

580
01:30:39,325 --> 01:30:42,351
The road to hell begins here, Mr. Wick.

581
01:30:42,361 --> 01:30:44,261
He is at the museum.

582
01:30:44,296 --> 01:30:47,390
Earl will guide you,
to be careful on your way down.

583
01:30:49,301 --> 01:30:50,359
And remember...

584
01:30:51,270 --> 01:30:53,238
You owe me.

585
01:30:54,406 --> 01:30:56,499
You dont want me owing you.

586
01:31:26,338 --> 01:31:27,430
Welcome, everyone.

587
01:31:27,439 --> 01:31:34,470
Let us toast to the future of the high
table and the memory of my dear sister...

588
01:32:02,508 --> 01:32:05,409
Mr. Akon, how are you?

589
01:33:01,300 --> 01:33:02,460
Wick is here!

590
01:33:02,534 --> 01:33:04,434
Yeah.

591
01:33:55,454 --> 01:33:58,355
You and you with me.
You go.

592
01:35:13,265 --> 01:35:18,430
<i>Welcome reflections of the soul
of the new modern New York.</i>

593
01:35:20,272 --> 01:35:24,368
<i>In this performance, the play of light
and the nature of self-image...</i>

594
01:35:24,409 --> 01:35:28,470
<i>Unite provide an experience
that highlights...</i>

595
01:35:28,480 --> 01:35:33,315
<i>The fragility of our perception
of space and our place in it.</i>

596
01:35:33,352 --> 01:35:36,515
<i>We hope that this show can
provide new insights...</i>

597
01:35:36,555 --> 01:35:40,389
<i>For your understanding of
the world, and maybe...</i>

598
01:35:40,425 --> 01:35:45,260
<i>Will lead to a deeper reflection
on the nature of sound.</i>

599
01:35:50,369 --> 01:35:52,337
My God, John.

600
01:35:53,372 --> 01:35:55,272
Oh my God.

601
01:35:55,307 --> 01:35:57,298
You just dont get it.

602
01:35:58,510 --> 01:36:01,308
The mark is completed John.

603
01:36:02,247 --> 01:36:04,238
You ve should just run away.

604
01:36:14,359 --> 01:36:16,418
You know what the
Camorra will do to you.

605
01:36:18,330 --> 01:36:20,298
You think you're the Old Testament?

606
01:36:20,465 --> 01:36:22,330
No, John.

607
01:36:24,536 --> 01:36:26,231
No.

608
01:36:28,340 --> 01:36:30,467
Killing me will not stop the contract.

609
01:36:31,443 --> 01:36:36,312
Killing me will make
it so much worse.

610
01:36:38,250 --> 01:36:39,478
John.

611
01:36:40,485 --> 01:36:42,419
You know what I think?

612
01:36:44,523 --> 01:36:46,354
I think you're addicted.

613
01:36:47,392 --> 01:36:49,360
To revenges.

614
01:37:06,378 --> 01:37:12,339
<i>Welcome reflections of the soul
of the new modern New York.</i>

615
01:37:14,486 --> 01:37:16,454
No wife...

616
01:37:17,489 --> 01:37:19,423
No Life...

617
01:37:21,360 --> 01:37:22,418
No home...

618
01:37:23,428 --> 01:37:25,362
Vengeance...

619
01:37:25,530 --> 01:37:28,260
That's all you have.

620
01:37:28,533 --> 01:37:31,229
You wanted me back.

621
01:37:31,503 --> 01:37:33,494
I'm back.

622
01:40:31,416 --> 01:40:34,351
Go. I will finish this.

623
01:42:01,406 --> 01:42:04,273
Be seeing you.

624
01:42:04,276 --> 01:42:08,235
Sure.

625
01:42:26,431 --> 01:42:28,228
Good evening.

626
01:42:30,268 --> 01:42:31,268
Is the Manager in?

627
01:42:31,436 --> 01:42:33,336
The manager...

628
01:42:33,405 --> 01:42:35,270
He is always in.

629
01:42:40,412 --> 01:42:41,412
Winston!

630
01:42:42,447 --> 01:42:44,472
Mr. D'Antonio?

631
01:42:45,317 --> 01:42:47,444
Lovely evening, I see.

632
01:42:48,253 --> 01:42:50,448
Seeking safe harbor I presume?

633
01:42:51,389 --> 01:42:53,516
I want a membership provoked.
Now.

634
01:42:53,558 --> 01:42:58,325
In the eyes of this institution,
Mr.Wick is ok.

635
01:42:58,330 --> 01:43:00,457
Then you know that I have
the right to demand...

636
01:43:00,498 --> 01:43:04,525
Nothing!
You demand nothing, Mr. D'Antonio.

637
01:43:04,536 --> 01:43:08,267
This kingdom is mine and mine alone.

638
01:43:10,408 --> 01:43:11,408
Right.

639
01:43:12,277 --> 01:43:15,440
Then enjoy your kingdom,
Winston, while you still can...

640
01:43:15,447 --> 01:43:19,406
And you, its privileges, sir.

641
01:43:31,529 --> 01:43:35,295
I am here to see Santino D'Antonio.

642
01:43:38,336 --> 01:43:41,396
He is waiting for you in a lounge,
Sir.

643
01:44:32,257 --> 01:44:33,485
Duck fat.

644
01:44:33,525 --> 01:44:35,356
Makes all the difference.

645
01:44:35,527 --> 01:44:39,258
Jonathan,
have you seen the menu here?

646
01:44:39,531 --> 01:44:41,328
Where are the options?

647
01:44:41,366 --> 01:44:42,492
Jonathan, listen to me...

648
01:44:43,268 --> 01:44:46,260
Guests can stay here...
a long time...

649
01:44:46,371 --> 01:44:48,464
And never eat the
same menu twice.

650
01:44:48,473 --> 01:44:52,432
Jonathan just walk away.

651
01:44:54,245 --> 01:44:56,304
Yeah, Jonathan.
Walk away...

652
01:45:04,522 --> 01:45:06,513
What have you done?

653
01:45:10,528 --> 01:45:12,462
Finished it.

654
01:45:30,382 --> 01:45:32,247
How was he?

655
01:45:32,317 --> 01:45:35,445
He was a good dog.
I have enjoyed his company.

656
01:45:40,458 --> 01:45:42,358
Lets go home.

657
01:47:18,389 --> 01:47:20,289
Mr. Wick?

658
01:47:26,264 --> 01:47:28,323
If you would be so...

659
01:48:02,534 --> 01:48:04,365
Come on, boy.

660
01:48:12,377 --> 01:48:15,312
It has been a pleasure Mr.Wick.

661
01:48:21,519 --> 01:48:23,350
Good-Bye.

662
01:49:00,358 --> 01:49:01,382
John.

663
01:49:01,526 --> 01:49:03,255
Winston.

664
01:49:04,462 --> 01:49:06,430
What am I looking at?

665
01:49:08,266 --> 01:49:12,430
The Camorra doubles Santinos open
contract is going international.

666
01:49:13,271 --> 01:49:14,499
High table?

667
01:49:17,275 --> 01:49:18,537
And the Continental?

668
01:49:20,345 --> 01:49:22,438
You've killed the man on
continental ground, Jonathan.

669
01:49:22,447 --> 01:49:26,383
You leave me no choice but to
declay you ex-comunicado...

670
01:49:28,319 --> 01:49:30,514
Any services we provided...

671
01:49:30,555 --> 01:49:34,423
and connection of The Continental
are now closed to you...

672
01:49:37,495 --> 01:49:40,225
I'm so sorry.

673
01:49:42,300 --> 01:49:44,359
Your life is now fulfilled.

674
01:49:46,437 --> 01:49:48,496
Then why am I not dead?

675
01:49:49,540 --> 01:49:52,441
Cause I didnt want you to be.

676
01:49:55,279 --> 01:49:56,405
Now.

677
01:50:24,275 --> 01:50:27,472
You have one hour.
I cannot delay it any longer.

678
01:50:28,546 --> 01:50:31,310
You might need this.

679
01:50:32,483 --> 01:50:34,246
Down the road.

680
01:50:38,356 --> 01:50:39,414
Winston.

681
01:50:40,491 --> 01:50:41,515
Tell them.

682
01:50:43,261 --> 01:50:44,489
Tell them All.

683
01:50:45,329 --> 01:50:49,265
Who ever comes...

684
01:50:49,434 --> 01:50:51,368
I will kill them.

685
01:50:52,270 --> 01:50:54,329
I will kill them all.

686
01:50:57,475 --> 01:50:59,306
Of course you will.

687
01:51:03,381 --> 01:51:05,246
Jonathan.

688
01:51:06,517 --> 01:51:08,314
Winston.

689
01:51:31,342 --> 01:51:32,502
