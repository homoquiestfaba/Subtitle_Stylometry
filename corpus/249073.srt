1
00:02:11,664 --> 00:02:13,154
Let's talk business.

2
00:02:14,467 --> 00:02:17,800
This fat bastard is moving in
on Morizio's business.

3
00:02:17,871 --> 00:02:20,066
You know Morizio
is a reasonable guy.

4
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:24,440
He just wants
a little conversation.

5
00:02:24,511 --> 00:02:27,275
But this guy,
he don't wanna hear about it.

6
00:02:27,347 --> 00:02:29,247
Maybe he'll listen to you.

7
00:02:29,315 --> 00:02:33,308
He comes to town every Tuesday.
Are you free Tuesday?

8
00:02:35,355 --> 00:02:37,346
Yeah, I'm free Tuesday.

9
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:56,174
Nice to see you again,
Mr. Jones.

10
00:03:10,256 --> 00:03:12,281
Remember, neatness counts.

11
00:03:12,358 --> 00:03:14,792
You got one half hour.

12
00:03:22,202 --> 00:03:24,693
One hour.

13
00:03:35,682 --> 00:03:37,115
What?

14
00:03:37,183 --> 00:03:42,348
It's Tonto, downstairs.
There's a guy wants to talk to you.

15
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:45,723
What's he look like?

16
00:03:48,194 --> 00:03:50,355
Serious.

17
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:53,456
-Tell him I'm coming up.
-He's coming up.

18
00:03:55,735 --> 00:03:59,637
Somebody's coming up.
Somebody serious.

19
00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:07,375
Mickey, open your eyes.
We got company.

20
00:04:09,882 --> 00:04:11,713
We got company.

21
00:04:24,163 --> 00:04:25,596
Come on.

22
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:35,773
Stop, man!

23
00:04:46,352 --> 00:04:49,287
Tell the driver to wait for us
out back, and hurry up.

24
00:05:36,402 --> 00:05:39,496
-Sweetie, what's going on?
-Don't worry, baby.

25
00:05:39,572 --> 00:05:41,665
It's cool. Take a nap.

26
00:05:59,926 --> 00:06:02,326
Oh, my God.

27
00:06:02,395 --> 00:06:04,556
Those fuckers blocked
both the exits.

28
00:06:08,768 --> 00:06:10,201
Check the terrace!

29
00:07:23,743 --> 00:07:26,439
-911 emergency. 
-I need help.

30
00:07:26,512 --> 00:07:28,912
-Somebody's trying to kill me.
-Just stay on the line. 

31
00:07:28,981 --> 00:07:31,609
I'll just be off a moment. 

32
00:07:31,684 --> 00:07:34,118
I'm gonna connect you
with an officer. 

33
00:07:52,271 --> 00:07:55,604
DetectiveJefferson. 
May I help you?

34
00:07:55,675 --> 00:07:57,643
I'll call you back.

35
00:08:01,314 --> 00:08:05,978
Relax, man. I got half of Bolivia
sitting in them suitcases.

36
00:08:06,052 --> 00:08:09,818
Hasn't even been cut yet.
Go ahead, take it. It's yours.

37
00:08:14,193 --> 00:08:16,627
Dial this number.

38
00:08:29,408 --> 00:08:32,468
I'll talk to you later,
sweetie, okay?

39
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:35,544
Bye.

40
00:08:39,385 --> 00:08:42,354
-Hello?
-It's Morizio. Remember me?

41
00:08:42,421 --> 00:08:47,017
-I see you're back in town. 
-Yeah. I mean, no.

42
00:08:47,093 --> 00:08:49,027
Just for today.

43
00:08:49,095 --> 00:08:51,859
So it's safe to say
today's your last day in town... 

44
00:08:51,931 --> 00:08:54,695
and we'll never see
your fat fucking face again. 

45
00:08:54,767 --> 00:08:57,361
Yeah. Right.

46
00:08:57,436 --> 00:09:00,200
Let me speak
to our mutual friend. 

47
00:09:02,108 --> 00:09:04,269
He wants to talk to you.

48
00:09:09,615 --> 00:09:13,711
Make sure he understands,
and let him go. 

49
00:09:22,128 --> 00:09:26,064
Do you understand?

50
00:09:26,132 --> 00:09:28,760
-So say it.
-I understand.

51
00:09:30,803 --> 00:09:32,236
Good.

52
00:09:58,331 --> 00:09:59,764
Jesus.

53
00:10:10,676 --> 00:10:12,268
Two milk as usual?

54
00:11:22,248 --> 00:11:23,909
Why did you hide the cigarette?

55
00:11:25,618 --> 00:11:27,779
This building's full of rats.

56
00:11:27,853 --> 00:11:32,153
I didn't want my old man to find out.
Got enough problems.

57
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:42,567
What happened?

58
00:11:44,136 --> 00:11:47,196
I fell off my bike.

59
00:11:59,285 --> 00:12:02,686
Don't tell my dad
about the cigarette, okay?

60
00:12:13,799 --> 00:12:17,633
-Why are you doing this to us?
-I don't know-

61
00:12:17,703 --> 00:12:20,968
People got memory problems these days.
It must be the sun.

62
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:23,406
-Know when to come out of the sun.
-I don't know how it happened.

63
00:12:23,476 --> 00:12:25,501
What's my job? I'm just a holder.

64
00:12:25,578 --> 00:12:28,411
I hold the stuff you give to me.
I don't look at it or touch it.

65
00:12:28,481 --> 00:12:30,574
-I don't know how to cut it.
-Try to follow me.

66
00:12:30,649 --> 00:12:33,243
In June, we gave you the dope.
It tests 100 percent pure.

67
00:12:33,319 --> 00:12:36,914
Now it's July, we pick up the dope,
and it tests 90 percent pure.

68
00:12:36,989 --> 00:12:40,516
Somewhere between June and July,
ten percent turned to cut!

69
00:12:40,593 --> 00:12:43,858
I don't know. It's none of my business.
You give me the stuff, I hold it.

70
00:12:43,929 --> 00:12:47,421
-That's all I know.
-I'm trying to help you out here...

71
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:50,162
but if you're gonna be
a hard-ass about it...

72
00:12:50,236 --> 00:12:52,602
I gotta disturb him.

73
00:12:52,671 --> 00:12:57,938
When he's into his music,
he hates being disturbed.

74
00:12:58,010 --> 00:13:00,274
I'm telling you the truth.

75
00:13:00,346 --> 00:13:04,612
I hope so, because he's got a talent
for sniffin' out a lie.

76
00:13:04,683 --> 00:13:06,514
It's scary.

77
00:13:06,585 --> 00:13:09,679
It's almost like a sixth sense.

78
00:13:09,755 --> 00:13:13,623
Are you gonna change your tune
or I gotta bust into his?

79
00:13:15,928 --> 00:13:18,294
I'm telling you the truth.

80
00:13:25,871 --> 00:13:27,304
All right.

81
00:13:30,009 --> 00:13:31,636
Stan.

82
00:13:35,047 --> 00:13:38,676
I'm sorry.
He said he didn't cut the dope.

83
00:14:19,925 --> 00:14:22,052
Of course he didn't.

84
00:14:31,437 --> 00:14:33,200
Just do me a favor.

85
00:14:33,272 --> 00:14:35,968
Find out who did by tomorrow.

86
00:14:36,041 --> 00:14:37,872
Noon.

87
00:14:49,455 --> 00:14:52,049
Malky, wait.

88
00:14:52,124 --> 00:14:55,150
I didn't cut your shit.

89
00:14:55,227 --> 00:14:57,661
Find out yourself!.

90
00:15:01,133 --> 00:15:04,068
What are you doin' out here?
Get inside and do your homework.

91
00:15:04,136 --> 00:15:06,798
-I did it already.
-Get inside and help your sister...

92
00:15:06,872 --> 00:15:08,396
clean up the goddamn house!

93
00:15:08,474 --> 00:15:10,567
And stop smoking cigarettes!

94
00:17:00,252 --> 00:17:01,480
One!

95
00:17:02,921 --> 00:17:04,980
Two. Take a deep breath in. 

96
00:17:05,057 --> 00:17:07,116
Take a deep breath out. 

97
00:17:07,192 --> 00:17:11,288
-Take a deep breath. Inhale. 
-Time's up. My turn.

98
00:17:11,363 --> 00:17:14,093
Change the channel,
and I'll smash your face.

99
00:17:14,166 --> 00:17:16,566
Ready for the legs. 
And down. 

100
00:17:28,247 --> 00:17:30,306
Sorry, sweetheart.

101
00:17:30,382 --> 00:17:32,213
Squeeze. Release. 

102
00:17:32,284 --> 00:17:34,548
Good morning.

103
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:36,679
Hi, honey.

104
00:17:38,424 --> 00:17:42,190
Sweetheart, turn that down.
Mama's got a headache.

105
00:17:42,261 --> 00:17:45,492
-She took my turn.
-She wants to watch goddamn cartoons!

106
00:17:45,564 --> 00:17:47,498
It wouldn't hurt her
to move her ass.

107
00:17:47,566 --> 00:17:49,557
I'm not the one
with a fat ass around here.

108
00:17:49,635 --> 00:17:51,899
Two and up. 

109
00:17:51,970 --> 00:17:54,404
Can someone who's doing nothing
all day but watching cartoons...

110
00:17:54,473 --> 00:17:57,067
move a little ass
and go get some food?

111
00:17:57,142 --> 00:18:01,636
-Legs. Beautiful. 
-I dare you to say that again.

112
00:18:06,385 --> 00:18:10,082
-Margie, I think I screwed up.
-It wouldn't be the first time.

113
00:18:10,155 --> 00:18:13,591
You always come up
with somethin', right?

114
00:18:13,659 --> 00:18:15,923
I think I went too far this time.

115
00:18:15,994 --> 00:18:19,430
You're goin' too far right now.
I'm gonna be late for work.

116
00:18:19,498 --> 00:18:21,932
How about workin'
at home today?

117
00:18:23,735 --> 00:18:27,762
Really feel it. 
That's it, stomach in. 

118
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:31,435
-One-
-Now it's my turn!

119
00:18:31,510 --> 00:18:34,070
Shit!
She's gonna hit me!

120
00:18:34,146 --> 00:18:36,580
-Daddy, she's-
-Shit! Shut the goddamn door!

121
00:18:38,117 --> 00:18:39,914
Please don't shoot!

122
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:44,254
Fuckin' bitch.

123
00:18:44,323 --> 00:18:49,124
-Megatron!
-Firm up the whole body. 

124
00:18:49,194 --> 00:18:53,255
When you use the Quadra-Step,
your thigh muscles-

125
00:18:53,332 --> 00:18:56,324
-Can somebody answer the phone?
-I'm busy!

126
00:19:02,875 --> 00:19:05,309
-Hello?
-This is Marguerite McCallister... 

127
00:19:05,377 --> 00:19:09,871
headmistress at the Spencer School
in Wildwood, NewJersey. 

128
00:19:09,948 --> 00:19:12,644
Is Mr. or Mrs. Lando home?

129
00:19:15,554 --> 00:19:17,613
This is she.

130
00:19:17,689 --> 00:19:20,988
Mrs. Lando, when your husband
enrolled Mathilda at Spencer... 

131
00:19:21,059 --> 00:19:23,323
he told us she had problems. 

132
00:19:23,395 --> 00:19:25,989
As you know, we pride ourselves
on turning troubled girls... 

133
00:19:26,064 --> 00:19:28,157
into healthy,
productive young women. 

134
00:19:28,233 --> 00:19:31,168
But if they are not here,
there is very little we can do. 

135
00:19:31,236 --> 00:19:34,501
Mathilda left school
without permission nearly two weeks ago. 

136
00:19:34,573 --> 00:19:37,508
I know your husband paid tuition
in advance for a year... 

137
00:19:37,576 --> 00:19:41,672
but if you will refer to the rules
and regulations manual we sent you... 

138
00:19:41,747 --> 00:19:45,683
you will see that unless there is
a valid excuse for prolonged absence... 

139
00:19:45,751 --> 00:19:48,686
your tuition will be forfeit. 

140
00:19:48,754 --> 00:19:51,279
She's dead.

141
00:20:11,276 --> 00:20:15,212
Tell that fuckin' kid to do
a little work around here!

142
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:19,546
Clean up!
I'm tired of this fuckin' mess.

143
00:20:19,618 --> 00:20:21,051
Hurry up!

144
00:20:34,466 --> 00:20:36,661
Why am I feeling

145
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:38,669
When things could look black

146
00:20:38,737 --> 00:20:43,037
That nothing
could possibly go wrong

147
00:20:44,109 --> 00:20:49,069
This has been
a most unusual day

148
00:20:50,249 --> 00:20:53,343
Love has made me see things

149
00:20:53,418 --> 00:20:59,254
In a different way

150
00:21:26,852 --> 00:21:31,084
Is life always this hard,
or is it just when you're a kid?

151
00:21:34,526 --> 00:21:36,460
Always like this.

152
00:21:43,201 --> 00:21:44,634
Keep it.

153
00:21:52,711 --> 00:21:56,545
I'm going grocery shopping.
You want some milk?

154
00:21:56,615 --> 00:21:59,550
One quart or two?
It's two, right?

155
00:23:42,721 --> 00:23:47,021
I like these calm little moments
before the storm.

156
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:50,624
It reminds me of Beethoven.

157
00:23:56,034 --> 00:23:59,197
Can you hear it?

158
00:23:59,271 --> 00:24:03,139
It's like when you put your head
to the grass...

159
00:24:03,208 --> 00:24:05,403
you can hear it growin'.

160
00:24:05,477 --> 00:24:08,241
You can hear the insects.

161
00:24:13,885 --> 00:24:16,877
-Do you like Beethoven?
-Couldn't really say.

162
00:24:16,955 --> 00:24:18,923
I'm gonna play you some.

163
00:24:22,894 --> 00:24:24,327
Daddy!

164
00:24:35,807 --> 00:24:37,741
You better stay here.

165
00:25:19,518 --> 00:25:21,452
We said noon.

166
00:25:24,990 --> 00:25:26,924
I've got one minute past.

167
00:25:30,862 --> 00:25:32,989
You don't like Beethoven.

168
00:25:34,566 --> 00:25:36,431
You don't know
what you're missing.

169
00:25:36,501 --> 00:25:40,995
Overtures like that
get my juices flowing.

170
00:25:41,072 --> 00:25:43,666
So powerful.

171
00:25:43,742 --> 00:25:47,906
But after his openings,
to be honest...

172
00:25:47,979 --> 00:25:52,075
he does tend to get
a little fucking boring.

173
00:25:54,252 --> 00:25:56,379
That's why I stopped!

174
00:26:00,692 --> 00:26:03,024
Toss the apartment.

175
00:26:23,715 --> 00:26:27,481
You're a Mozart fan.
I love him too.

176
00:26:27,552 --> 00:26:30,544
I love Mozart!

177
00:26:35,694 --> 00:26:38,128
He was Austrian, you know.

178
00:26:38,196 --> 00:26:41,962
But for this kind of work,
he's a little bit light.

179
00:26:42,033 --> 00:26:45,059
So I tend to go
for the heavier guys.

180
00:26:45,136 --> 00:26:48,731
-Cool.
-Dude, what the fuck are you doing?

181
00:26:48,807 --> 00:26:51,571
Man,
keep your bombacut mouth shut.

182
00:26:51,643 --> 00:26:55,511
Check out Brahms.
He's good too.

183
00:26:55,580 --> 00:26:58,140
-What the fuck do you know about music?
-Man, knock it off!.

184
00:27:12,998 --> 00:27:15,831
-You check the mattress?
-Nope.

185
00:27:57,809 --> 00:27:59,242
Wow.

186
00:28:19,030 --> 00:28:21,760
Oh! Fuck!

187
00:28:21,833 --> 00:28:24,165
He's dead.

188
00:28:24,235 --> 00:28:28,501
Jesus. Look what you did.

189
00:28:28,573 --> 00:28:30,507
Stan, you all right?

190
00:28:50,929 --> 00:28:52,863
What are you doin'?

191
00:28:52,931 --> 00:28:57,027
-He's dead!
-But he ruined my suit.

192
00:28:57,102 --> 00:28:59,593
Yeah, I know,
but he's dead.

193
00:28:59,671 --> 00:29:03,038
He's a piece of meat.
Forget about it. Calm down.

194
00:29:03,108 --> 00:29:04,632
I'm calm.

195
00:29:04,709 --> 00:29:06,939
Stay there, all right?

196
00:29:10,281 --> 00:29:12,749
Benny!

197
00:29:15,587 --> 00:29:20,581
Jesus fuckin' Christ, Benny!
It's Malky and Stan!

198
00:29:22,127 --> 00:29:24,254
Take it easy, all right?

199
00:29:24,329 --> 00:29:26,126
Come on.

200
00:29:29,934 --> 00:29:31,902
Come on,
let's get a cigarette.

201
00:29:31,970 --> 00:29:34,461
Benny, we're comin' out!

202
00:29:34,539 --> 00:29:37,337
Benny, don't fire!

203
00:29:37,408 --> 00:29:40,206
Get in there!

204
00:29:40,278 --> 00:29:42,678
Jesus fuckin' Christ, Benny!

205
00:29:42,747 --> 00:29:46,376
You wear somethin' new and-
Got a light?

206
00:29:46,451 --> 00:29:48,419
Take it easy.

207
00:29:49,654 --> 00:29:51,588
What's happening out there?

208
00:29:51,656 --> 00:29:53,521
It's all right, ma'am.
D.E.A. Police.

209
00:29:53,591 --> 00:29:56,788
Leave that poor family alone.

210
00:29:56,861 --> 00:30:00,490
-Everything's all right. Just calm down.
-I am calm. I'm calm.

211
00:30:00,565 --> 00:30:02,795
Why don't you
leave them alone?

212
00:30:04,202 --> 00:30:07,296
He said go back inside.

213
00:30:12,076 --> 00:30:14,840
Stan, I think it's better
if we go inside.

214
00:30:32,463 --> 00:30:37,833
Benny, turn that kitchen upside down!
Find that shit!

215
00:30:37,902 --> 00:30:41,565
Willy Blood, look what you did!
You killed a 4-year-old kid!

216
00:30:41,639 --> 00:30:43,573
Did you really
have to do that?

217
00:30:59,390 --> 00:31:02,086
Please open the door.

218
00:31:58,182 --> 00:32:01,709
Benny,
there are three kids here.

219
00:32:01,786 --> 00:32:04,118
I think Stan killed this girl.

220
00:32:04,188 --> 00:32:06,748
Willy, that asshole,
shot the little boy.

221
00:32:06,824 --> 00:32:09,349
The third one's missing.
Find her.

222
00:32:18,569 --> 00:32:21,265
Shit. We missed
the little girl, man.

223
00:32:21,339 --> 00:32:24,934
I'm gonna find the fuckin' super
in this goddamn building.

224
00:32:50,501 --> 00:32:55,768
-Don't you recognize me?
-Me, Grimlock. Know you!

225
00:33:05,883 --> 00:33:07,316
Shit.

226
00:33:08,653 --> 00:33:12,646
-Yo! I found it!
-Bingo!

227
00:33:12,724 --> 00:33:15,818
-They found it.
-I know.

228
00:33:15,893 --> 00:33:17,827
There it is.

229
00:33:18,896 --> 00:33:20,830
There's cops outside.
We better go.

230
00:33:20,898 --> 00:33:24,334
It's the cops outside.
We better go. You stay here.

231
00:33:26,404 --> 00:33:27,871
What do I say?

232
00:33:40,084 --> 00:33:41,847
Tell them...

233
00:33:41,919 --> 00:33:46,185
we were doing our job.

234
00:33:55,867 --> 00:33:59,826
-What's your name?
-Mathilda.

235
00:34:05,443 --> 00:34:07,968
-Sorry about your father.
-If somebody didn't do it...

236
00:34:08,046 --> 00:34:11,072
one day or another,
I would have probably done it myself.

237
00:34:13,117 --> 00:34:14,550
Your mother, she-

238
00:34:14,619 --> 00:34:16,382
She's not my mother.

239
00:34:16,454 --> 00:34:21,983
My sister wanted to lose some weight.
Bet she never looked better.

240
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:24,961
She's not even my real sister.
Just a half sister.

241
00:34:25,029 --> 00:34:27,395
Not a good half at that.

242
00:34:37,775 --> 00:34:39,709
If you couldn't stand them,
why are you crying?

243
00:34:39,777 --> 00:34:42,746
They killed my brother.

244
00:34:42,814 --> 00:34:47,046
What the hell did he do?
He was four years old.

245
00:34:47,118 --> 00:34:49,052
He never used to cry.

246
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:53,147
He just used to sit
next to me and cuddle.

247
00:34:53,224 --> 00:34:58,127
I was more of a mother to him
than that goddamned pig ever was.

248
00:34:58,196 --> 00:35:02,599
Don't talk like that about pigs.
They're usually nicer than people.

249
00:35:02,667 --> 00:35:04,897
But they smell like shit.

250
00:35:06,838 --> 00:35:08,271
Not true.

251
00:35:08,339 --> 00:35:12,935
As a matter of fact,
right now I have one in my kitchen...

252
00:35:13,010 --> 00:35:14,910
that's very clean...

253
00:35:14,979 --> 00:35:19,109
-and smells very nice.
-You don't have a pig in your kitchen.

254
00:35:21,185 --> 00:35:22,618
Yes, I do.

255
00:35:22,687 --> 00:35:25,850
I was just in there,
and I didn't see any goddamned pig.

256
00:35:25,923 --> 00:35:29,359
Don't move.
I'll get him.

257
00:35:31,329 --> 00:35:33,263
Piggy, where are you?

258
00:35:34,866 --> 00:35:36,800
There you are.

259
00:35:43,875 --> 00:35:46,810
Hi, Mathilda.

260
00:35:46,878 --> 00:35:49,540
Hi, piggy.

261
00:35:57,021 --> 00:36:00,252
How are you today?

262
00:36:00,324 --> 00:36:02,884
I've seen better days.

263
00:36:10,001 --> 00:36:14,836
-What's your name?
-Leon.

264
00:36:17,208 --> 00:36:19,301
Cute name.

265
00:36:26,284 --> 00:36:30,380
You have anyone to go to,
any family anyplace else?

266
00:36:41,532 --> 00:36:43,966
I'm gonna get some more milk.

267
00:37:02,620 --> 00:37:04,087
Holy shit.

268
00:37:10,127 --> 00:37:14,063
Don't touch that, please.

269
00:37:14,131 --> 00:37:16,531
What do you do for a living?

270
00:37:17,602 --> 00:37:19,069
Cleaner.

271
00:37:20,471 --> 00:37:22,405
You're a hit man?

272
00:37:26,077 --> 00:37:27,544
Cool.

273
00:37:40,124 --> 00:37:44,584
-Do you clean anyone?
-No women, no kids. That's the rules.

274
00:37:44,662 --> 00:37:47,722
How much would it cost to hire someone
to get those dirtbags...

275
00:37:47,798 --> 00:37:50,596
who killed my brother?

276
00:37:50,668 --> 00:37:54,434
-Five grand a head.
-Wow.

277
00:37:54,505 --> 00:37:58,601
How about I work for you...

278
00:37:58,676 --> 00:38:02,168
and in exchange,
you teach me how to clean?

279
00:38:02,246 --> 00:38:05,340
What do you think?

280
00:38:05,416 --> 00:38:07,441
I'll clean your place.
I'll do the shopping.

281
00:38:07,518 --> 00:38:09,748
I'll even wash your clothes.

282
00:38:11,022 --> 00:38:15,356
-Is it a deal?
-No, it's not a deal.

283
00:38:22,867 --> 00:38:27,702
What do you want me to do?
I've got no place to go.

284
00:38:27,772 --> 00:38:31,606
You've had a rough day today.

285
00:38:34,545 --> 00:38:37,036
Go to sleep,
and we'll see tomorrow.

286
00:38:51,495 --> 00:38:54,623
You've been really great
with me, Leon...

287
00:38:54,699 --> 00:38:57,725
and it's not always like that.

288
00:38:57,802 --> 00:38:59,667
You know?

289
00:39:07,378 --> 00:39:08,811
Good night.

290
00:40:25,189 --> 00:40:27,453
You sleep well?

291
00:40:27,525 --> 00:40:29,857
Good.

292
00:40:29,927 --> 00:40:32,361
-After breakfast you gotta take off.
-Where to?

293
00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:35,092
Not my problem.

294
00:40:49,447 --> 00:40:50,914
Read it.

295
00:40:57,788 --> 00:40:59,813
You don't know how to read.

296
00:40:59,890 --> 00:41:02,882
I'm learning, but I've had
a lot of work lately...

297
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:06,020
so I'm a little behind.

298
00:41:06,096 --> 00:41:07,563
What's it say?

299
00:41:07,631 --> 00:41:11,692
I've decided what to do with my life.
I wanna be a cleaner.

300
00:41:11,769 --> 00:41:16,229
You wanna be a cleaner.
Here.

301
00:41:16,307 --> 00:41:21,074
Take it. It's a good-bye gift.
Go clean, but not with me.

302
00:41:21,145 --> 00:41:24,740
-I work alone. Understand?
-Bonnie and Clyde didn't work alone.

303
00:41:24,815 --> 00:41:27,807
Thelma and Louise didn't work alone.
They were the best.

304
00:41:29,987 --> 00:41:34,083
Mathilda, why are you
doing this to me?

305
00:41:34,158 --> 00:41:36,820
I've been nothing
but nice to you.

306
00:41:36,894 --> 00:41:39,761
I saved your life yesterday,
right outside the door.

307
00:41:39,830 --> 00:41:43,095
Right.
Now you're responsible for it.

308
00:41:43,167 --> 00:41:46,603
If you saved my life,
you must've saved it for a good reason.

309
00:41:46,670 --> 00:41:49,434
If you throw me out now,
it's like you never opened your door...

310
00:41:49,507 --> 00:41:52,340
like you let me die
right there in front of it.

311
00:41:52,409 --> 00:41:57,813
But you did open it. So-

312
00:42:01,085 --> 00:42:05,454
If you don't help me,
I'll die tonight. I can feel it.

313
00:42:05,523 --> 00:42:07,787
I don't wanna die tonight.

314
00:42:10,327 --> 00:42:12,795
You're just a little girl.

315
00:42:12,863 --> 00:42:15,798
Don't take it badly,
but I don't think you could do it.

316
00:42:15,866 --> 00:42:17,299
I'm sorry.

317
00:42:36,053 --> 00:42:37,987
How's that?

318
00:43:11,922 --> 00:43:15,016
Don't you ever do that again
or I'll break your head.

319
00:43:15,092 --> 00:43:16,525
You got that?

320
00:43:17,761 --> 00:43:21,197
I don't work like that.
It's not professional.

321
00:43:21,265 --> 00:43:23,199
There is rules.

322
00:43:24,268 --> 00:43:27,032
And stop saying okay
all the time!

323
00:43:30,107 --> 00:43:31,699
Good.

324
00:43:46,957 --> 00:43:49,187
You expect to use that
in this hotel?

325
00:43:51,161 --> 00:43:54,221
Mister, I have to use it...

326
00:43:54,298 --> 00:43:58,394
because I have an audition
atJuilliard next month...

327
00:43:58,469 --> 00:44:00,699
and I have to practice.

328
00:44:00,771 --> 00:44:04,639
Okay, but not after 10:00.

329
00:44:04,708 --> 00:44:06,767
-I promise.
-All right.

330
00:44:08,779 --> 00:44:11,748
I'll put you
at the end of the hall...

331
00:44:11,815 --> 00:44:15,911
so that you
don't disturb anyone.

332
00:44:15,986 --> 00:44:17,476
Fill those out, please.

333
00:44:21,659 --> 00:44:26,653
Daddy, can I please fill them out?
I like to check in to hotels.

334
00:44:30,200 --> 00:44:32,395
Thanks, Pop.
I'll bring these back in a minute.

335
00:44:32,469 --> 00:44:34,733
Fourth floor!

336
00:44:34,805 --> 00:44:36,397
Thanks, mister!

337
00:44:36,473 --> 00:44:39,567
You're lucky to have a little girl
that's interested in things.

338
00:44:41,945 --> 00:44:45,403
I have a kid, 17,
does nothing all day long.

339
00:44:51,021 --> 00:44:54,081
Can I leave my plant here
while I take my stuff upstairs?

340
00:44:54,158 --> 00:44:55,955
Of course.

341
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:20,145
I'm putting in a name of a girl
in my class who makes me sick.

342
00:45:22,686 --> 00:45:26,213
If things get hot,
she'll take the heat.

343
00:45:43,207 --> 00:45:45,835
There. Finished.

344
00:45:46,376 --> 00:45:49,368
-How old are you?
-Eighteen.

345
00:45:50,214 --> 00:45:53,206
-Eighteen?
-Want to see my license?

346
00:45:54,251 --> 00:45:58,517
No. You just look a little young.

347
00:45:59,289 --> 00:46:00,950
Thanks.

348
00:46:08,165 --> 00:46:11,726
Leon, I want you to teach me
how to be like you.

349
00:46:11,802 --> 00:46:14,066
I want to be strong and smart
like you.

350
00:46:15,839 --> 00:46:18,672
I know I'm not
strong enough yet...

351
00:46:18,742 --> 00:46:22,803
but I could learn the basics,
the theory.

352
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:27,010
What do you think?
Just the theory.

353
00:46:27,084 --> 00:46:29,348
I need this, Leon.

354
00:46:31,088 --> 00:46:33,181
I need time
to get my head together.

355
00:46:33,257 --> 00:46:36,021
Yeah, and I need...

356
00:46:41,765 --> 00:46:43,289
a drink.

357
00:46:43,367 --> 00:46:46,359
Don't move.
I'll go get one.

358
00:47:11,461 --> 00:47:14,897
When you told me
to get this baby out for you...

359
00:47:14,965 --> 00:47:17,229
I thought my hearin' was goin'.

360
00:47:17,301 --> 00:47:22,204
I says to myself,  Leon's a pro.
Nobody uses that except beginners. 

361
00:47:22,272 --> 00:47:24,035
I like to stay in shape.

362
00:47:24,107 --> 00:47:28,567
Sure.
Always stay on top of it.

363
00:47:28,645 --> 00:47:32,342
It's like me. I gotta know
where everything is all the time.

364
00:47:32,416 --> 00:47:34,976
I never leave this place,
except to go from here to there.

365
00:47:38,388 --> 00:47:41,380
Change ain't good, Leon.
You know?

366
00:47:52,336 --> 00:47:53,769
Check it.

367
00:47:55,339 --> 00:47:58,001
-Make sure it's the right thing.
-I trust you.

368
00:47:58,075 --> 00:48:01,101
One thing's got nothin' to do
with the other. Remember that.

369
00:48:02,512 --> 00:48:04,446
I will.

370
00:48:19,496 --> 00:48:22,465
The rifle is the first weapon
you learn how to use...

371
00:48:22,532 --> 00:48:26,366
because it lets you
keep your distance from the client.

372
00:48:26,436 --> 00:48:28,666
The closer you get
to being a pro...

373
00:48:28,739 --> 00:48:31,936
the closer you can get
to the client.

374
00:48:32,009 --> 00:48:35,536
The knife, for example,
is the last thing you learn.

375
00:48:41,218 --> 00:48:42,651
Position.

376
00:49:06,810 --> 00:49:10,644
Never take it off until the last minute.
It reflects light.

377
00:49:10,714 --> 00:49:13,512
They can see you coming
from a mile away.

378
00:49:13,583 --> 00:49:17,314
And always dress down.

379
00:49:17,387 --> 00:49:20,515
Never brighter
than the floor, okay?

380
00:49:23,393 --> 00:49:28,023
Let's practice now.
It's the best way to learn.

381
00:49:28,098 --> 00:49:30,191
Who should I hit?

382
00:49:30,267 --> 00:49:31,859
Whoever.

383
00:49:38,775 --> 00:49:41,039
I'll be with you in a second.
Give me a few minutes. Thank you.

384
00:49:41,111 --> 00:49:43,875
You guys get lost.
I don't want to see you.

385
00:49:43,947 --> 00:49:47,405
-Is everyone in position?
-This has to look natural.

386
00:49:56,960 --> 00:50:00,396
-No women, no kids. Right?
-Right.

387
00:50:07,671 --> 00:50:10,071
Jogger in the yellow and orange?

388
00:50:14,644 --> 00:50:17,044
Keep calm.

389
00:50:20,317 --> 00:50:23,878
Don't take your eyes off him.

390
00:50:23,954 --> 00:50:25,751
Breathe easy.

391
00:50:27,491 --> 00:50:29,118
Watch his movement.

392
00:50:31,661 --> 00:50:34,095
Pretend you're running with him.

393
00:50:37,134 --> 00:50:40,262
Try to feel his next movement.

394
00:50:41,838 --> 00:50:45,171
Take a deep breath.
Hold it.

395
00:50:53,750 --> 00:50:55,217
Now.

396
00:50:55,285 --> 00:50:57,116
Oh, my God!

397
00:50:57,187 --> 00:51:00,884
-I'm all right. I'm fine.
-Get down! Where'd that come from?

398
00:51:00,957 --> 00:51:04,723
One shot. Not bad, huh?

399
00:51:04,795 --> 00:51:07,229
-Who the hell fired?
-I just can't breathe! Get off me.

400
00:51:07,297 --> 00:51:10,960
Can we try
with real bullets now?

401
00:51:11,034 --> 00:51:13,002
Not today.
Let's pack up.

402
00:51:22,379 --> 00:51:23,812
Like that.

403
00:52:06,189 --> 00:52:09,522
-No, thanks.
-No discussion.

404
00:52:51,268 --> 00:52:53,236
It seemed...

405
00:52:54,638 --> 00:52:56,572
to Socrates-

406
00:53:04,381 --> 00:53:06,315
I'll do it.

407
00:53:20,330 --> 00:53:22,821
Leon, all we do is work.

408
00:53:22,899 --> 00:53:26,027
We need a break.
Let's play a game.

409
00:53:26,102 --> 00:53:29,765
-What kind of game?
-I have this great game.

410
00:53:29,839 --> 00:53:33,639
It makes you think and helps your
memory. It's exactly what you need.

411
00:53:47,023 --> 00:53:48,615
Like a virgin

412
00:53:50,493 --> 00:53:53,792
Touched for the very first time

413
00:53:58,268 --> 00:54:01,328
-Who is it?
-I don't know.

414
00:54:11,514 --> 00:54:17,282
Happy birthday to you

415
00:54:17,354 --> 00:54:21,654
Happy birthday, Mr. President

416
00:54:21,725 --> 00:54:24,159
I don't know.

417
00:54:32,969 --> 00:54:34,800
Moustache.

418
00:54:38,808 --> 00:54:42,335
I'm singing in the rain

419
00:54:42,412 --> 00:54:45,006
Just singing in the rain

420
00:54:45,081 --> 00:54:47,641
-What a beaut-
-Gene Kelly?

421
00:54:49,252 --> 00:54:50,685
Good.

422
00:54:50,754 --> 00:54:53,587
Your turn now.

423
00:54:59,095 --> 00:55:00,858
Okay, pilgrim.

424
00:55:04,267 --> 00:55:05,734
Clint Eastwood?

425
00:55:12,609 --> 00:55:17,706
-I don't know. I give up.
-John Wayne.

426
00:55:17,781 --> 00:55:21,774
I was just about to say that.
I swear. It's amazing.

427
00:55:21,851 --> 00:55:24,217
Leon, really brilliant.

428
00:55:26,623 --> 00:55:28,557
Amazing.

429
00:55:43,473 --> 00:55:47,739
-You love your plant, don't you?
-It's my best friend.

430
00:55:47,811 --> 00:55:51,406
Always happy.
No questions.

431
00:55:52,982 --> 00:55:56,076
It's like me, you see.

432
00:55:56,152 --> 00:55:58,313
No roots.

433
00:55:58,388 --> 00:56:02,154
If you really love it, you should
plant it in a park so it can have roots.

434
00:56:06,229 --> 00:56:08,891
You should be watering me
if you want me to grow.

435
00:56:11,134 --> 00:56:12,567
You're right.

436
00:56:24,013 --> 00:56:25,446
Wait!

437
00:56:40,263 --> 00:56:44,859
They gotta be jumping out of the plate.
They gotta be alive.

438
00:56:52,942 --> 00:56:55,308
It's been a long time, Leon.

439
00:57:01,217 --> 00:57:03,185
I missed you.

440
00:57:03,253 --> 00:57:08,088
-And you missed some nice jobs too.
-Been training.

441
00:57:08,158 --> 00:57:12,151
Training's good,
but don't overdo it.

442
00:57:12,228 --> 00:57:14,628
Training don't pay
as good as working, Leon.

443
00:57:14,697 --> 00:57:16,164
Tony...

444
00:57:19,068 --> 00:57:23,698
all the money I make,
that you keep for me-

445
00:57:23,773 --> 00:57:25,764
You need some money?

446
00:57:25,842 --> 00:57:27,400
Just curious.

447
00:57:27,477 --> 00:57:29,411
I've been working
a long time...

448
00:57:29,479 --> 00:57:33,176
and I haven't done anything
with my money.

449
00:57:35,285 --> 00:57:41,087
I thought maybe
someday I could use it.

450
00:57:41,157 --> 00:57:43,523
You met a woman.

451
00:57:53,102 --> 00:57:55,195
You gotta be careful
with women.

452
00:57:55,271 --> 00:57:58,240
Remember when you arrived
in this country?

453
00:57:58,308 --> 00:58:02,711
When I took you in, you were still wet
behind the fuckin' ears...

454
00:58:02,779 --> 00:58:05,714
and, already, you were in deep shit
because of a woman.

455
00:58:05,782 --> 00:58:10,685
-Don't forget that, Leon.
-I wish I could sometimes.

456
00:58:13,289 --> 00:58:15,587
You know, about my money-

457
00:58:15,658 --> 00:58:20,061
Maybe I could give...

458
00:58:20,129 --> 00:58:22,222
a little...

459
00:58:23,766 --> 00:58:26,064
to someone.

460
00:58:26,135 --> 00:58:29,229
You know, to help out.

461
00:58:31,774 --> 00:58:35,801
It's your money. I'm just
holding it for you, like a bank.

462
00:58:35,879 --> 00:58:40,248
Except better than a bank
because banks always get knocked off.

463
00:58:40,316 --> 00:58:42,648
No one knocks off old Tony.

464
00:58:42,719 --> 00:58:45,244
Besides, with a bank...

465
00:58:45,321 --> 00:58:48,586
there's always tons of forms
and all that shit.

466
00:58:48,658 --> 00:58:53,755
But old Tony, nothin' to read,
nothin' to write. It's all in his head.

467
00:58:55,064 --> 00:58:58,397
I know how to read now.

468
00:58:58,468 --> 00:59:01,596
That's good, Leon.

469
00:59:04,507 --> 00:59:06,099
Your money's here.

470
00:59:06,175 --> 00:59:08,871
Whenever you want it,
you just ask me.

471
00:59:08,945 --> 00:59:13,006
-Here's a grand. Come on.
-It's okay. I don't need it.

472
00:59:13,082 --> 00:59:17,542
-Take it. Have some fun. Go ahead.
-Thank you.

473
00:59:17,620 --> 00:59:21,522
All right.
Now let's talk business.

474
00:59:21,591 --> 00:59:25,118
Don't move.
I'll go get the file.

475
00:59:25,194 --> 00:59:29,290
Manolo, a glass of milk
for my friend Leon here.

476
00:59:52,555 --> 00:59:54,989
Listen, Mathilda,
you better be careful.

477
00:59:55,058 --> 00:59:57,652
You can't just speak
to any guy off the street.

478
00:59:58,895 --> 01:00:01,659
Leon, get a grip.
What's the big fucking deal?

479
01:00:01,731 --> 01:00:04,495
I was just smoking a butt
while I was waiting.

480
01:00:06,235 --> 01:00:08,499
I want you to stop cursing.

481
01:00:08,571 --> 01:00:10,835
You can't talk to people
like that all the time.

482
01:00:10,907 --> 01:00:14,001
I want you to make an effort
to talk nice.

483
01:00:18,748 --> 01:00:21,979
And I want you to stop smoking.
It will kill you.

484
01:00:28,591 --> 01:00:31,355
Stay away from him.
He looks like a weirdo.

485
01:00:36,432 --> 01:00:40,198
I'll be out in five minutes.
Stand where I can see you.

486
01:00:53,616 --> 01:00:57,814
Leon, I think I'm kinda
falling in love with you.

487
01:01:00,390 --> 01:01:03,689
It's the first time for me,
you know.

488
01:01:03,760 --> 01:01:07,127
How do you know it's love
if you've never been in love before?

489
01:01:07,196 --> 01:01:10,063
'Cause I feel it.

490
01:01:10,133 --> 01:01:11,725
Where?

491
01:01:15,338 --> 01:01:17,272
In my stomach.

492
01:01:20,176 --> 01:01:23,634
It's all warm.

493
01:01:23,713 --> 01:01:28,946
I always had a knot there,
and now it's gone.

494
01:01:31,854 --> 01:01:37,121
Mathilda, I'm glad you
don't have a stomachache anymore.

495
01:01:37,193 --> 01:01:39,661
I don't think
it means anything.

496
01:01:39,729 --> 01:01:43,597
I'm late for work.
I hate being late for work.

497
01:02:27,977 --> 01:02:30,002
How's the practicing going?

498
01:02:59,942 --> 01:03:05,073
-How are we today, miss?
-A little sick of practicing.

499
01:03:05,148 --> 01:03:07,082
I understand.

500
01:03:07,150 --> 01:03:09,084
But you're doing all right.

501
01:03:09,152 --> 01:03:11,143
I haven't received
any complaints.

502
01:03:11,220 --> 01:03:15,486
I put a cloth over the strings
to lessen the noise.

503
01:03:16,626 --> 01:03:18,150
That's very smart.

504
01:03:18,227 --> 01:03:22,857
-Not everyone loves music.
-I know.

505
01:03:22,932 --> 01:03:25,059
What does your father do?

506
01:03:26,469 --> 01:03:30,929
-He's a composer.
-That's wonderful.

507
01:03:31,007 --> 01:03:33,567
Except he's not really my father.

508
01:03:39,148 --> 01:03:40,877
He's my lover.

509
01:03:44,954 --> 01:03:48,287
Think I'll go for a walk.

510
01:04:03,005 --> 01:04:06,600
-What are you doing Saturday night?
-What about dinner?

511
01:04:06,676 --> 01:04:09,770
-Where you goin'?
-Visiting friends at 6J.

512
01:04:09,846 --> 01:04:11,711
Go ahead.
What about Saturday?

513
01:04:11,781 --> 01:04:15,740
-About 8:00?
-I don't know.

514
01:04:15,818 --> 01:04:19,914
You got plans?

515
01:04:25,328 --> 01:04:27,193
Meet you here?

516
01:05:42,204 --> 01:05:44,764
We know you're a busy man.
We'll make this short.

517
01:05:44,840 --> 01:05:48,776
If you'll just take us step-by-step
through exactly what happened.

518
01:05:49,845 --> 01:05:52,678
The guy was here.
He went for his gun.

519
01:05:52,748 --> 01:05:54,943
Bang, we shot him.

520
01:05:58,254 --> 01:06:01,189
-Where exactly were the kids?
-I don't know!

521
01:06:01,257 --> 01:06:03,748
They should have been at school,
don't you think?

522
01:06:03,826 --> 01:06:05,760
Your statement said
you were the first man in.

523
01:06:05,828 --> 01:06:07,853
-Didn't you see any kids?
-The door was broken.

524
01:06:07,930 --> 01:06:09,989
What happened?
Did you follow the procedure?

525
01:06:12,101 --> 01:06:15,662
I lost a good man here.
What the fuck do you want with me?

526
01:06:15,738 --> 01:06:18,172
Cooperation.

527
01:06:21,610 --> 01:06:25,512
I haven't got time
for this Mickey Mouse bullshit!

528
01:06:25,581 --> 01:06:30,211
You want cooperation?
Come up in my office, room 4602.

529
01:06:41,297 --> 01:06:43,390
Kids should be at school.

530
01:06:44,633 --> 01:06:47,227
Come on, that's my ball!

531
01:06:47,303 --> 01:06:51,797
Give that back.
Where you goin'?

532
01:06:51,874 --> 01:06:55,310
Damn! Where you goin', man?
That's my ball!

533
01:07:02,051 --> 01:07:03,985
Follow the blue car.

534
01:07:04,053 --> 01:07:07,216
You want me to blast the music
and go through the lights?

535
01:07:07,289 --> 01:07:08,847
No, drive slowly.

536
01:07:08,924 --> 01:07:11,722
Take the hundred bucks,
and shut the fuck up.
