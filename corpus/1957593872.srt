1
00:00:01,478 --> 00:00:04,061
(upbeat music)

2
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:22,103
(suspenseful music)

3
00:00:42,737 --> 00:00:43,570
- Come on.

4
00:00:46,490 --> 00:00:47,810
- Relax, he'll be here.

5
00:01:15,079 --> 00:01:15,912
Let's go.

6
00:01:26,967 --> 00:01:27,967
Take a left.

7
00:01:36,572 --> 00:01:37,905
Okay, stop here.

8
00:02:23,557 --> 00:02:24,603
All right, let's go.

9
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:35,577
(tires screeching)

10
00:02:52,002 --> 00:02:55,050
So how long you been working with Danny?

11
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:56,350
- Eight or nine months.

12
00:02:56,350 --> 00:02:57,183
- And they put you on this job?

13
00:02:57,183 --> 00:02:59,770
You've come a long way,
eight or nine months.

14
00:02:59,770 --> 00:03:00,743
Must be connected.

15
00:03:06,170 --> 00:03:09,241
- What you looking for?
- He's nervous.

16
00:03:09,241 --> 00:03:10,658
First hit, right?

17
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:13,759
- So?

18
00:03:13,759 --> 00:03:16,013
- What a way to make your bones.

19
00:03:16,013 --> 00:03:18,013
Whacking off Joey Gallo.

20
00:03:26,383 --> 00:03:29,590
(horn honking)

21
00:03:29,590 --> 00:03:32,190
(camera clicking)

22
00:03:32,190 --> 00:03:35,357
(upbeat asian music)

23
00:03:39,478 --> 00:03:42,311
(camera clicking)

24
00:03:50,955 --> 00:03:52,158
(people chattering)

25
00:03:52,158 --> 00:03:54,908
(women laughing)

26
00:04:08,208 --> 00:04:11,041
(camera clicking)

27
00:04:15,576 --> 00:04:17,130
- Take a right, then you go straight,

28
00:04:17,130 --> 00:04:19,213
and then you hang a left.

29
00:04:33,392 --> 00:04:34,371
- Looking for me?

30
00:04:34,371 --> 00:04:35,625
- What are you talking about?

31
00:04:35,625 --> 00:04:36,458
- You know what I'm talking about.

32
00:04:36,458 --> 00:04:37,910
You're in half the film I shot today.

33
00:04:37,910 --> 00:04:39,467
You want your picture taken?

34
00:04:39,467 --> 00:04:42,070
Make an appointment with
me, I do this for a living.

35
00:04:42,070 --> 00:04:44,080
- Stevie Collura, how you doing?

36
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:44,980
- Do I know you?

37
00:04:44,980 --> 00:04:46,702
- I'm a friend of Vinnie's.

38
00:04:46,702 --> 00:04:47,841
- My brother?

39
00:04:47,841 --> 00:04:49,780
- Yeah.
- Who are you?

40
00:04:52,513 --> 00:04:54,170
Oh.

41
00:04:54,170 --> 00:04:56,260
Dominic Cellini, you're
from the neighborhood here.

42
00:04:56,260 --> 00:04:57,170
What's the deal?

43
00:04:57,170 --> 00:04:58,644
- Look, I want to talk
to you about something.

44
00:04:58,644 --> 00:04:59,490
I'll buy you a beer.

45
00:04:59,490 --> 00:05:00,530
- Nah, I got prints drying.

46
00:05:00,530 --> 00:05:02,040
I got to get home.
- What if I walk with you?

47
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:02,893
It's important.

48
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:05,640
- Vinnie, he sent you to
check up on me, right?

49
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:06,483
- Hey, he's a little worried,

50
00:05:06,483 --> 00:05:08,340
you living in Greenwich village.

51
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:10,603
The hippies, just back from 'Nam.

52
00:05:10,603 --> 00:05:12,593
He thought maybe you brought
back some bad habits.

53
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:16,493
- Wrong.

54
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:18,583
If Vinnie thought though that,

55
00:05:18,583 --> 00:05:20,483
he'd come down here
himself and kick my butt.

56
00:05:21,410 --> 00:05:22,420
What do you want?

57
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:23,317
- I want you.

58
00:05:23,317 --> 00:05:25,290
I know about 'Nam.

59
00:05:25,290 --> 00:05:26,390
We've got guys in narcotics

60
00:05:26,390 --> 00:05:28,670
haven't made as many busts
in their whole careers

61
00:05:28,670 --> 00:05:31,023
as you made in one year in 'Nam.

62
00:05:31,023 --> 00:05:32,990
- You want me to be a narc? Forget it.

63
00:05:32,990 --> 00:05:34,470
- No.

64
00:05:34,470 --> 00:05:36,750
My beat's to find New York mob families.

65
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:40,013
Gambino, Colombo, Sciacca,
Lucchese and Genovese.

66
00:05:40,013 --> 00:05:41,650
- It's a lot of families.

67
00:05:41,650 --> 00:05:43,590
Must cost you a fortune in birthday cards.

68
00:05:43,590 --> 00:05:46,100
- We don't communicate that much.

69
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:47,593
That's why I'm talking to you.

70
00:05:49,810 --> 00:05:51,190
- You want me to do it for you?

71
00:05:51,190 --> 00:05:53,310
- Yeah. We need somebody inside.

72
00:05:53,310 --> 00:05:55,750
Someone Italian who
grew up in the streets,

73
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:57,150
knows how to handle himself.

74
00:05:58,460 --> 00:05:59,924
What do you say?

75
00:05:59,924 --> 00:06:01,653
- You think you got me figured, huh?

76
00:06:03,188 --> 00:06:04,600
- You were me 20 years ago.

77
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:05,433
- Oh, yeah?

78
00:06:05,433 --> 00:06:07,919
I guess I don't have much
to look forward to, huh?

79
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:10,250
- Not if you stick with this gig.

80
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:12,522
Come on, Collura, I know you.

81
00:06:12,522 --> 00:06:14,420
You like to see how close
to the edge you can get

82
00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:16,400
without falling off.

83
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:18,100
Ain't any edges steeper than this.

84
00:06:19,150 --> 00:06:19,983
We got a deal?

85
00:06:23,110 --> 00:06:23,943
- No.

86
00:06:24,923 --> 00:06:25,863
- Whatever.

87
00:06:27,150 --> 00:06:29,400
When you get tired of
asking babies to smile,

88
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:31,453
give me a call.

89
00:06:36,175 --> 00:06:38,594
(door opens)

90
00:06:38,594 --> 00:06:41,094
(door closes)

91
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:44,010
- You call Ma lately?

92
00:06:44,010 --> 00:06:45,710
- Couple a days ago, she seems okay.

93
00:06:45,710 --> 00:06:47,100
- You should visit.

94
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:48,150
Hey, she misses you.

95
00:06:48,150 --> 00:06:50,140
- I'll see her on Sunday.

96
00:06:50,140 --> 00:06:50,973
Busy, huh?

97
00:06:50,973 --> 00:06:51,806
- Oh yeah.

98
00:06:51,806 --> 00:06:52,770
Lunchtime's been great.

99
00:06:52,770 --> 00:06:55,030
Benny, don't forget, breadsticks.

100
00:06:55,030 --> 00:06:57,440
- Hey, I ran into a friend
of yours a couple days ago,

101
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:58,290
Dom Cellini.

102
00:06:58,290 --> 00:06:59,293
- Dom? Oh yeah.

103
00:07:00,367 --> 00:07:02,543
- He's a cop, right?
- Oh, big time.

104
00:07:03,917 --> 00:07:04,750
- Kind of big time.

105
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:08,513
He straight arrows,
he's lining his pockets.

106
00:07:08,513 --> 00:07:09,542
- Hey, hey, what's up?

107
00:07:09,542 --> 00:07:10,543
You in some kind of trouble?

108
00:07:10,543 --> 00:07:12,780
- No, I just couldn't get fix on him,

109
00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:13,613
that's all.

110
00:07:13,613 --> 00:07:14,880
- Huh, that's Cellini.

111
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:16,940
You never know what that pizon's thinking.

112
00:07:16,940 --> 00:07:18,910
I mean, he has more fun than the bad guys.

113
00:07:18,910 --> 00:07:21,340
You should hear the stories he
tells, the things he's done.

114
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:22,173
Guy's like a celebrity.

115
00:07:22,173 --> 00:07:23,310
I mean, wherever he goes,

116
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:24,840
restaurants, clubs, the garden,

117
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:26,040
they treat them like a VIP

118
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:27,522
and you don't have to shmear nobody.

119
00:07:27,522 --> 00:07:29,176
- Come on.

120
00:07:29,176 --> 00:07:31,220
A cop with that kind of juice?

121
00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:32,670
He's honest. What's the deal?

122
00:07:33,557 --> 00:07:34,880
- People want to be his friend, you know?

123
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:35,930
They want to hear his stories,

124
00:07:35,930 --> 00:07:37,831
makes 'em feel like
they're part of things.

125
00:07:37,831 --> 00:07:40,564
I wouldn't want it, but I
guess it's an exciting life

126
00:07:40,564 --> 00:07:42,560
if you don't mind taking chances.

127
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:44,813
First thing, I think you
got to be a little crazy.

128
00:07:45,690 --> 00:07:47,429
- Yeah. Sounded like it.

129
00:07:47,429 --> 00:07:50,200
(suspenseful music)

130
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:51,640
- [Inspector] And faithfully
discharge the duties

131
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:52,680
of a police officer

132
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:54,360
in the New York City Police Department.

133
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:56,660
- And faithfully discharge
the duties of a police officer

134
00:07:56,660 --> 00:07:57,870
of the New York City Police Department.

135
00:07:57,870 --> 00:08:00,693
- To the best of my ability.
- To the best of my ability.

136
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:09,010
- Collura, welcome to the force.

137
00:08:09,010 --> 00:08:09,893
- Thank you, sir.

138
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:13,293
- Detective Cellini.
- Inspector.

139
00:08:33,763 --> 00:08:35,620
Take a good look, kid.

140
00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:38,170
That's the last you're
gonna see of it for a while.

141
00:08:38,170 --> 00:08:39,600
- So that's it, I'm a cop?

142
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:41,680
- New York's finest, but nobody knows

143
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:43,403
except Akers, me and you.

144
00:08:44,550 --> 00:08:47,270
Second thoughts? Cold feet?

145
00:08:47,270 --> 00:08:48,103
- No, I'm fine.

146
00:08:49,361 --> 00:08:51,353
What about the rest of
the guys in your unit?

147
00:08:52,690 --> 00:08:53,570
- Even your paycheck comes out

148
00:08:53,570 --> 00:08:55,740
of a photo supply company in Jersey,

149
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:57,860
deposit it straight into your bank.

150
00:08:57,860 --> 00:08:58,853
Any more questions?

151
00:09:00,370 --> 00:09:02,900
- Yeah. What made you so sure about me?

152
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:03,750
- Just a feeling.

153
00:09:05,380 --> 00:09:06,820
- Yeah.

154
00:09:06,820 --> 00:09:08,033
I'm you 20 years ago.

155
00:09:10,868 --> 00:09:15,868
(people chattering)
(sirens wailing)

156
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,870
- Beautiful girl lying in the car.

157
00:09:23,870 --> 00:09:26,274
The guy says to the
undertaker, "What she die of?"

158
00:09:26,274 --> 00:09:28,947
"The clap," the undertaker says.

159
00:09:30,430 --> 00:09:33,547
"Get out of here, nobody
dies from the clap."

160
00:09:33,547 --> 00:09:35,528
"Oh yeah," says the undertaker.

161
00:09:35,528 --> 00:09:37,505
"You do when you give it to Fat Tony."

162
00:09:37,505 --> 00:09:39,920
(guys laughing)

163
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:41,807
Yo, Stevie.
- Hey.

164
00:09:41,807 --> 00:09:43,779
- Hey.
- Long time, how you doing?

165
00:09:43,779 --> 00:09:44,612
- All right.

166
00:09:44,612 --> 00:09:45,700
Old pal from the
neighborhood, Stevie Collura.

167
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:47,360
We grew up together.

168
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:48,216
So what's with the camera?

169
00:09:48,216 --> 00:09:49,232
You look like a tourist.

170
00:09:49,232 --> 00:09:50,460
You still live in Brooklyn?

171
00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:51,760
- No, no, I moved out.

172
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:53,720
My old man died when I was overseas.

173
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:55,630
- Yeah, I heard. Sorry.

174
00:09:55,630 --> 00:09:57,280
- Thanks. Hey, I got a
place in West Village.

175
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:58,220
I'm a photographer now.

176
00:09:58,220 --> 00:09:59,900
- Get out of here!

177
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:01,150
Come, I'll buy you a cup.

178
00:10:02,990 --> 00:10:05,337
So you was in Vietnam, huh?

179
00:10:05,337 --> 00:10:08,267
I would have got in the
army, but I got flat feet.

180
00:10:08,267 --> 00:10:09,173
How was it?

181
00:10:10,153 --> 00:10:12,840
- I made it home, you know? Surprised me.

182
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:15,120
- You know, I gotta get me one of these.

183
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:16,550
It's great.

184
00:10:16,550 --> 00:10:17,430
So you making a dollar?

185
00:10:17,430 --> 00:10:19,147
- I am, just made a lot of money

186
00:10:19,147 --> 00:10:20,541
shooting weddings and baby pictures.

187
00:10:20,541 --> 00:10:21,690
- Baby pictures?

188
00:10:21,690 --> 00:10:23,552
You do christenings?

189
00:10:23,552 --> 00:10:25,183
- Yeah, sure.

190
00:10:25,183 --> 00:10:27,497
- I got this idea, it
might do us both some good.

191
00:10:27,497 --> 00:10:29,206
You free Sunday?
- Yeah.

192
00:10:29,206 --> 00:10:30,936
- Okay, man, you're working.

193
00:10:30,936 --> 00:10:33,201
(people chattering)

194
00:10:33,201 --> 00:10:35,030
Remember what I said, careful
where you point that thing.

195
00:10:35,030 --> 00:10:36,550
A lot of people in here
can get real touchy.

196
00:10:36,550 --> 00:10:38,800
- I know, I only take pictures
of the women and the new kid.

197
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:40,620
- Right, then I want you to
make up a nice picture book

198
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:42,430
for Scimone and his wife, okay?

199
00:10:42,430 --> 00:10:44,010
And send me the bill.

200
00:10:44,010 --> 00:10:45,300
It's Scimone's first grandchild.

201
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:47,540
We're gonna make some points here.

202
00:10:47,540 --> 00:10:48,857
It's cool. He's with me.

203
00:10:48,857 --> 00:10:50,961
Mr. Scimone knows all about it.

204
00:10:50,961 --> 00:10:53,413
- Yeah. Okay.
- He's the photographer, okay?

205
00:10:54,311 --> 00:10:56,080
- Hold him up, hold him up.

206
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:56,913
Hold him up, yeah.

207
00:10:56,913 --> 00:10:57,746
That's good.

208
00:10:57,746 --> 00:10:59,647
Gonna sneak around over here.

209
00:10:59,647 --> 00:11:01,125
(whistles)

210
00:11:01,125 --> 00:11:04,113
(camera clicking)

211
00:11:04,113 --> 00:11:05,222
Okay.

212
00:11:05,222 --> 00:11:07,945
(people chattering)

213
00:11:07,945 --> 00:11:09,313
(camera clicking)

214
00:11:09,313 --> 00:11:11,636
I think we should try
and uh, switch sides.

215
00:11:11,636 --> 00:11:13,986
- He's a good kid, he
just got out of the army.

216
00:11:15,460 --> 00:11:17,194
I like the way he handles himself.

217
00:11:17,194 --> 00:11:18,590
- Yeah? You trust him.

218
00:11:18,590 --> 00:11:19,880
- He's from the neighborhood.

219
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:22,110
I grew up with him.

220
00:11:22,110 --> 00:11:23,743
I think he could use a few bucks.

221
00:11:25,632 --> 00:11:28,233
He's war hero, Paulie,
he's having a hard time.

222
00:11:31,949 --> 00:11:33,364
- All right. Give him a try.

223
00:11:33,364 --> 00:11:34,610
Go 'head.

224
00:11:34,610 --> 00:11:36,367
- Okay. That's real nice.

225
00:11:36,367 --> 00:11:38,092
Yeah. Thank you.

226
00:11:38,092 --> 00:11:40,509
(soft music)

227
00:12:13,511 --> 00:12:16,344
(camera clicking)

228
00:12:17,478 --> 00:12:19,145
That's a nice smile.

229
00:12:23,527 --> 00:12:24,730
- Steve.
- Huh?

230
00:12:24,730 --> 00:12:25,563
Oh yeah, um.

231
00:12:27,810 --> 00:12:31,000
Excuse me, all right? I'll be right back.

232
00:12:33,342 --> 00:12:34,175
Yeah?

233
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:37,300
- Stevie, this is my boss, Paul Raggio.

234
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:39,423
- Stevie, I heard some good things.

235
00:12:41,130 --> 00:12:41,963
See you around?

236
00:12:43,746 --> 00:12:44,666
- He likes you.

237
00:12:44,666 --> 00:12:45,499
- He likes me?

238
00:12:45,499 --> 00:12:46,332
He looks like he wants to whack me.

239
00:12:46,332 --> 00:12:47,165
- When he wants to whack you,

240
00:12:47,165 --> 00:12:48,500
he'll look like he loves you.

241
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:49,600
So you getting some good pictures?

242
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:51,370
- Yeah, I think so.

243
00:12:51,370 --> 00:12:52,323
- What's you do?

244
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:54,233
- I'm just taking out the strobe,

245
00:12:54,233 --> 00:12:55,710
you know, it's gotta recharge.

246
00:12:57,350 --> 00:12:58,183
- Danny.

247
00:12:59,648 --> 00:13:00,925
- Business, okay, get yourself a drink.

248
00:13:00,925 --> 00:13:02,508
I'll be right back.

249
00:13:14,744 --> 00:13:17,577
(camera clicking)

250
00:13:20,172 --> 00:13:23,005
(camera clicking)

251
00:13:26,187 --> 00:13:29,020
(camera clicking)

252
00:13:31,208 --> 00:13:34,642
(camera clicking)

253
00:13:34,642 --> 00:13:37,475
(camera clicking)

254
00:13:39,740 --> 00:13:42,573
(camera clicking)

255
00:13:46,567 --> 00:13:49,628
(camera clicking)

256
00:13:49,628 --> 00:13:52,461
(camera clicking)

257
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:08,253
(camera clicking)

258
00:14:12,856 --> 00:14:14,177
- You know what you got here?

259
00:14:14,177 --> 00:14:16,000
You know who this guy is?

260
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,340
- Yeah. It's Carmine
Persico, Colombo family.

261
00:14:18,340 --> 00:14:19,600
Danny introduced me to him.

262
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:21,801
- I mean the other guy, huh?

263
00:14:21,801 --> 00:14:22,690
- No.

264
00:14:22,690 --> 00:14:23,820
- Judge Francis X Herbert,

265
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:26,060
New York Supreme Court, that's who.

266
00:14:26,060 --> 00:14:28,380
This here, Judge Maslow,
Appellates Division.

267
00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:29,451
You know about him.

268
00:14:29,451 --> 00:14:30,597
- Yeah, Danny said there's a
lot of political heavies there,

269
00:14:30,597 --> 00:14:32,600
you know, guys on the tape
paying their respects.

270
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:34,980
- Oh no, what's his name?

271
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:36,370
Dunbar.

272
00:14:36,370 --> 00:14:38,140
Guy's a precinct captain in the Bronx.

273
00:14:38,140 --> 00:14:39,050
Damn.

274
00:14:39,050 --> 00:14:41,460
The inspector's gonna blow
his stack when he sees this.

275
00:14:41,460 --> 00:14:42,944
- Oh, sorry about that.

276
00:14:42,944 --> 00:14:44,217
- Hey, it's not your fault.

277
00:14:44,217 --> 00:14:45,090
You did good.

278
00:14:45,090 --> 00:14:46,690
This stuff is gold.

279
00:14:46,690 --> 00:14:47,800
- Piece of cake.

280
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:49,560
- Stevie, this isn't a piece of cake.

281
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:51,420
You took a major risk doing this.

282
00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:52,820
Don't do it again.

283
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:53,890
You get cocky in this business,

284
00:14:53,890 --> 00:14:55,390
you don't get old, understand?

285
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:59,230
- Oh, oh.

286
00:14:59,230 --> 00:15:00,500
Pretty girl.

287
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:01,333
Who is she?

288
00:15:01,333 --> 00:15:03,090
- I didn't get a chance to find out.

289
00:15:03,090 --> 00:15:05,024
- Good. You ain't there to socialize.

290
00:15:05,024 --> 00:15:06,660
An undercover cop can't afford to.

291
00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:08,410
- Look, would you relax Cellini?

292
00:15:08,410 --> 00:15:09,530
Come on, I'm in.

293
00:15:09,530 --> 00:15:10,710
In like Flynn, Danny says,

294
00:15:10,710 --> 00:15:13,170
I'm making the rounds with him tomorrow.

295
00:15:13,170 --> 00:15:16,020
- Just take it slow. Okay?

296
00:15:16,020 --> 00:15:16,853
- Careful.

297
00:15:17,690 --> 00:15:18,683
- Take it slow.

298
00:15:29,090 --> 00:15:30,394
- Who is she?
- Her?

299
00:15:30,394 --> 00:15:32,140
It's Maria, forget about her.

300
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:33,390
She's out of your league.

301
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:36,990
Nice, you done good, kid.

302
00:15:36,990 --> 00:15:38,505
Lou is gonna like these.

303
00:15:38,505 --> 00:15:40,950
Come on, Ben. Where the hell are you?

304
00:15:40,950 --> 00:15:41,783
- What's his problem?

305
00:15:41,783 --> 00:15:43,250
- He owe us two months.

306
00:15:43,250 --> 00:15:44,740
That mamaluke thinks he's dealing

307
00:15:44,740 --> 00:15:46,330
with First National Bank here.

308
00:15:46,330 --> 00:15:48,630
- So what, we break his legs?

309
00:15:48,630 --> 00:15:49,500
- It's not like the movies, Stevie,

310
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:51,040
you don't break a guy's leg
because he owes you money.

311
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:52,960
If he's in the hospital,
how's he gonna work?

312
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:53,793
How's he gonna pay you?

313
00:15:53,793 --> 00:15:54,830
No, you just lean on him.

314
00:15:54,830 --> 00:15:56,441
Make him think next time
he don't pay his bills,

315
00:15:56,441 --> 00:15:58,751
you break his stupid neck.

316
00:15:58,751 --> 00:16:00,001
Ah, here we go.

317
00:16:07,841 --> 00:16:11,161
You stay here, keep an eye out.

318
00:16:11,161 --> 00:16:14,463
Hey Benny, where the hell's my money?

319
00:16:14,463 --> 00:16:17,213
(Benny grunting)

320
00:16:21,403 --> 00:16:24,153
(Benny grunting)

321
00:16:28,091 --> 00:16:29,657
"You do when you give it to Fat Tony."

322
00:16:29,657 --> 00:16:30,490
- Oh-ho.

323
00:16:39,137 --> 00:16:44,137
- What's going on?
(man speaking faintly)

324
00:16:45,019 --> 00:16:47,572
Don's here.
- Gambino?

325
00:16:47,572 --> 00:16:50,239
- Yeah, just do what I do, okay?

326
00:16:51,638 --> 00:16:54,638
(suspenseful music)

327
00:17:11,133 --> 00:17:13,966
- I feel like I'm in church.
- Shh.

328
00:17:17,770 --> 00:17:19,350
- Hey Paulie, remember Stevie?

329
00:17:19,350 --> 00:17:21,270
- Yeah.
- He went out with me today.

330
00:17:21,270 --> 00:17:23,550
- Yeah, how'd it go?

331
00:17:23,550 --> 00:17:25,913
- Great. He's a natural.

332
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:30,553
- That's good.

333
00:17:38,596 --> 00:17:40,156
(guys laughing)

334
00:17:40,156 --> 00:17:42,059
- Not bad for the first day, huh?

335
00:17:42,059 --> 00:17:43,367
- It was a piece of cake.

336
00:17:43,367 --> 00:17:45,460
- Yeah, piece of cake, huh?

337
00:17:45,460 --> 00:17:46,928
Come on.
- Come on where?

338
00:17:46,928 --> 00:17:48,743
- Calzone, you're buying.

339
00:17:49,930 --> 00:17:51,565
- Code yellow. Identify.

340
00:17:51,565 --> 00:17:54,283
- Zero two zero, I got
a message for Amber.

341
00:17:55,210 --> 00:17:57,940
Message is code one, need a face-to-face.

342
00:17:57,940 --> 00:18:00,593
Location five, 2300 hours, back please.

343
00:18:01,627 --> 00:18:03,134
- [Operator] Code one, face-to-face,

344
00:18:03,134 --> 00:18:05,620
2300 hours, location five.

345
00:18:05,620 --> 00:18:08,093
Clear?
- Huh? Yeah. Yeah. Clear.

346
00:18:12,810 --> 00:18:14,583
Yeah. Yeah. Her name is Maria.

347
00:18:15,420 --> 00:18:16,470
Yeah. Her name's Maria.

348
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:18,400
Maria. You know, Maria
like the song, you know?

349
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:20,113
Yeah. I met her at this christening.

350
00:18:21,054 --> 00:18:23,020
She's incredible.

351
00:18:23,020 --> 00:18:25,290
Maria. Yeah. Yeah.

352
00:18:25,290 --> 00:18:26,130
Well, I didn't meet her.

353
00:18:26,130 --> 00:18:27,170
You see, she was holding the baby

354
00:18:27,170 --> 00:18:28,080
and I was taking the pictures.

355
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:28,913
I didn't want to come on to her

356
00:18:28,913 --> 00:18:29,871
like the rest of them mooks, you know?

357
00:18:29,871 --> 00:18:30,704
But uh...

358
00:18:31,710 --> 00:18:32,543
Hey, hey!

359
00:18:33,410 --> 00:18:34,710
She's here, she's standing right here.

360
00:18:34,710 --> 00:18:36,020
Right in front of me.

361
00:18:36,020 --> 00:18:37,660
Maria, right?

362
00:18:37,660 --> 00:18:38,810
Say hello to my mother.

363
00:18:40,270 --> 00:18:41,103
Say hello!

364
00:18:42,255 --> 00:18:44,480
(Maria laughing)

365
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:46,140
- It's a dial tone.

366
00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:48,567
- Yeah, she must have passed out.

367
00:18:48,567 --> 00:18:50,770
You see, I never called home

368
00:18:50,770 --> 00:18:52,750
about a girl I met before, you know?

369
00:18:52,750 --> 00:18:53,907
- Very funny.
- Yeah. Yeah.

370
00:18:53,907 --> 00:18:54,880
It's a good way to break the ice,

371
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:56,550
that and a blow torch.

372
00:18:56,550 --> 00:18:58,820
I'm Steve. Steve Collura, and you are?

373
00:18:58,820 --> 00:19:00,025
- In a hurry.

374
00:19:00,025 --> 00:19:01,580
- Maria in a hurry.

375
00:19:01,580 --> 00:19:03,290
Hey, don't worry, my mom
will love you anyway.

376
00:19:03,290 --> 00:19:04,548
- What is it you want?

377
00:19:04,548 --> 00:19:07,483
- A house in New Rochelle,
three sons, a daughter,

378
00:19:11,268 --> 00:19:12,268
and a cup of coffee.

379
00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:14,740
What do you say?

380
00:19:14,740 --> 00:19:16,650
- Why should I have coffee with you?

381
00:19:16,650 --> 00:19:18,625
Just because you took my picture.

382
00:19:18,625 --> 00:19:19,713
- No, um.

383
00:19:23,893 --> 00:19:25,617
Because I gave it to you.

384
00:19:26,499 --> 00:19:28,916
(soft music)

385
00:19:33,805 --> 00:19:35,649
So how 'bout it?

386
00:19:35,649 --> 00:19:37,934
- I'm paying for myself.
- Fine.

387
00:19:37,934 --> 00:19:40,563
If it makes you feel better
you can pay for me too.

388
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:50,570
Look, it's easy for people
at home to talk about the war

389
00:19:50,570 --> 00:19:52,023
like it was history or something.

390
00:19:52,023 --> 00:19:52,856
You know what I mean?

391
00:19:52,856 --> 00:19:54,750
Like politically right and morally wrong.

392
00:19:54,750 --> 00:19:56,210
But I was there.

393
00:19:56,210 --> 00:19:57,043
I was in the middle of it.

394
00:19:57,043 --> 00:19:58,640
Guys were dying all around me.

395
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:00,690
My friends were losing their lives and...

396
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:04,270
This is a really good conversation

397
00:20:04,270 --> 00:20:05,580
for us to be having on our first meeting.

398
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:07,050
It's really classy.

399
00:20:07,050 --> 00:20:08,610
- No, it's okay.

400
00:20:08,610 --> 00:20:10,180
I mean, it's certainly more interesting

401
00:20:10,180 --> 00:20:12,130
than the usual things I hear from guys.

402
00:20:12,990 --> 00:20:14,810
- Well anyway, I want to know about you.

403
00:20:14,810 --> 00:20:16,060
- Why?

404
00:20:16,060 --> 00:20:17,580
I mean, I haven't done nearly

405
00:20:17,580 --> 00:20:19,490
the fascinating things you have.

406
00:20:19,490 --> 00:20:20,323
- Maybe.

407
00:20:21,337 --> 00:20:22,540
But I want to know about
the fascinating things

408
00:20:22,540 --> 00:20:24,140
that are going on inside of you.

409
00:20:25,276 --> 00:20:26,226
- What do you mean?

410
00:20:27,290 --> 00:20:28,754
- Eyes.

411
00:20:28,754 --> 00:20:31,280
People say people see a lot
of things with their mouths,

412
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:32,680
but the eyes tell the truth.

413
00:20:33,914 --> 00:20:36,264
I like what I'm hearing,
I'd like to hear more.

414
00:20:41,020 --> 00:20:42,640
What are you doing?

415
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:43,960
- I think I've said enough for one day.

416
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:44,793
- Oh-ho-ho.

417
00:20:46,392 --> 00:20:48,170
You're weird, you know that?

418
00:20:48,170 --> 00:20:50,240
Maria, whatever your last name is.

419
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:51,433
- Maria Caprefoli.

420
00:20:53,170 --> 00:20:55,310
- Now my mother is gonna be thrilled.

421
00:20:55,310 --> 00:20:56,143
- Oh, come on.

422
00:20:56,143 --> 00:20:57,923
I'm sure you know a lot
of other Italian girls.

423
00:20:58,970 --> 00:20:59,803
- Not like you.

424
00:21:04,849 --> 00:21:07,340
- I have to go.
- That's it?

425
00:21:07,340 --> 00:21:08,840
We don't see each other again?

426
00:21:10,690 --> 00:21:11,940
- Wednesday afternoons I work

427
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:14,073
at Saint Genesius Church in Brooklyn.

428
00:21:17,060 --> 00:21:18,974
- Wait, hey, wait a second.

429
00:21:18,974 --> 00:21:20,650
Are you gonna be a nun?

430
00:21:20,650 --> 00:21:22,673
- No. I work with the children there.

431
00:21:24,490 --> 00:21:25,743
- Thank you, Lord.

432
00:21:49,886 --> 00:21:51,310
- All right, listen. I want
you to handle this one.

433
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:52,840
Remember what I told you.

434
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:54,490
- Guys name is Larner?

435
00:21:54,490 --> 00:21:56,020
- Lerner
- Lerner.

436
00:21:56,020 --> 00:21:57,450
- Right. Watch him.

437
00:21:57,450 --> 00:21:58,283
Thinks he's a tough guy.

438
00:21:58,283 --> 00:21:59,623
- Yeah, it's a piece of cake.

439
00:22:00,770 --> 00:22:02,050
- Didn't figure on this, did ya you punks?

440
00:22:02,050 --> 00:22:03,200
I was waiting for you.

441
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:05,530
- Look, Lerner.
- Shut your face!

442
00:22:05,530 --> 00:22:07,080
You'll tell that Gambino scum bucket

443
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:08,830
that Barney Lerner
don't pay no protection.

444
00:22:08,830 --> 00:22:09,683
You understand?

445
00:22:11,060 --> 00:22:12,670
- I don't think that's such
a good idea, Mr. Lerner.

446
00:22:12,670 --> 00:22:15,000
I also don't think you should
be insulting Mr. Gambino.

447
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,230
- What? Heh.

448
00:22:16,230 --> 00:22:17,160
I'm the one holding the gun

449
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:17,993
and you're telling me what to do?

450
00:22:17,993 --> 00:22:19,680
- You're not gonna shoot me, buddy.

451
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:21,370
If you do, you're gonna go to jail

452
00:22:21,370 --> 00:22:23,330
or you're gonna end up in a Jersey swamp.

453
00:22:23,330 --> 00:22:24,343
Now what's the percentage in that?

454
00:22:24,343 --> 00:22:25,950
Why don't you just put the gun down?

455
00:22:25,950 --> 00:22:26,890
- I'll put it down.

456
00:22:26,890 --> 00:22:29,273
I'll put it down your throat
and blow your ass off!

457
00:22:30,350 --> 00:22:31,400
- With the safety on?

458
00:22:39,388 --> 00:22:40,230
Now, I've got the cylinder.

459
00:22:40,230 --> 00:22:41,063
It's not gonna fire.

460
00:22:41,063 --> 00:22:42,587
Use your head. Let it go.

461
00:22:42,587 --> 00:22:44,210
And nobody gets hurt.

462
00:22:44,210 --> 00:22:46,070
- No, I let it go, you'll kill me.

463
00:22:46,070 --> 00:22:46,950
- Nobody's gonna kill you.

464
00:22:46,950 --> 00:22:47,783
What's the point of that?

465
00:22:47,783 --> 00:22:48,790
You're a valuable customer.

466
00:22:48,790 --> 00:22:51,400
Let the gun go and I promise you, hey!

467
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:53,013
I promise you I won't hurt ya.

468
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:56,551
Okay. Have it your way.

469
00:22:56,551 --> 00:22:58,206
- Ah!

470
00:22:58,206 --> 00:23:00,633
- Danny, hey, I'm handling this, okay?

471
00:23:01,850 --> 00:23:02,683
All right.

472
00:23:02,683 --> 00:23:04,060
I'm gonna take your first
month's installment.

473
00:23:04,060 --> 00:23:06,520
No more, no less.

474
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:07,353
All right.

475
00:23:07,353 --> 00:23:09,660
- Let me pop him one, Stevie, just once.

476
00:23:09,660 --> 00:23:11,070
- Danny, I promised Mr. Lerner

477
00:23:11,070 --> 00:23:12,050
that nobody was gonna hurt him

478
00:23:12,050 --> 00:23:13,590
and I keep my promise.

479
00:23:13,590 --> 00:23:14,580
- Hurt me?

480
00:23:14,580 --> 00:23:16,350
You broke my finger.

481
00:23:16,350 --> 00:23:18,180
Come on. It's not broken.

482
00:23:18,180 --> 00:23:19,013
It's just dislocated.

483
00:23:19,013 --> 00:23:20,160
Let me see it.

484
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:20,993
Let me see it!

485
00:23:22,988 --> 00:23:24,326
- Ah!

486
00:23:24,326 --> 00:23:25,970
- Yeah, see?

487
00:23:25,970 --> 00:23:26,803
Try to bend it.

488
00:23:28,330 --> 00:23:29,163
Go ahead.

489
00:23:30,290 --> 00:23:31,873
It's good as new.

490
00:23:31,873 --> 00:23:33,410
Now you have a nice day

491
00:23:33,410 --> 00:23:36,142
and we'll see you in a month, all right?

492
00:23:36,142 --> 00:23:38,975
(engine rumbling)

493
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:54,300
- So what's the problem?

494
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:57,090
- I had to hurt somebody today.

495
00:23:57,090 --> 00:23:57,924
- Yeah?

496
00:23:57,924 --> 00:23:59,293
Pain builds character.

497
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:01,353
- Yeah, well, I still don't like it.

498
00:24:01,353 --> 00:24:02,893
What if they ask me to whack somebody?

499
00:24:03,950 --> 00:24:04,783
- Call me.

500
00:24:05,788 --> 00:24:07,730
- What you gonna do, give me a note?

501
00:24:07,730 --> 00:24:09,290
- If we have to, we'll pull you out.

502
00:24:09,290 --> 00:24:10,470
Don't worry.

503
00:24:10,470 --> 00:24:12,170
We don't leave our people hanging.

504
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:15,710
- Pain builds character.

505
00:24:15,710 --> 00:24:18,060
It's a good thing you're
not a doctor, Cellini.

506
00:24:32,826 --> 00:24:35,170
- What's that?
- It's $300.

507
00:24:35,170 --> 00:24:36,860
Ma, would you buy yourself a dishwasher?

508
00:24:36,860 --> 00:24:38,500
- I got a dishwasher.

509
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:40,490
I also got a telephone.

510
00:24:40,490 --> 00:24:43,113
Some people don't know how to use it.

511
00:24:43,113 --> 00:24:46,030
Where'd you get $300?
- Taking pictures.

512
00:24:46,030 --> 00:24:48,600
- Of who? That bum Danny?

513
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:50,693
- Ma, what is that supposed to mean?

514
00:24:50,693 --> 00:24:53,710
- Oh, I hear what's going, you know?

515
00:24:53,710 --> 00:24:54,563
People talk.

516
00:24:55,538 --> 00:24:58,050
Is that why you risked
your life in Vietnam?

517
00:24:58,050 --> 00:24:59,400
So you could come home and be a punk.

518
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:01,270
- Ma, I made this money legit.

519
00:25:01,270 --> 00:25:02,770
I'm a successful photographer.

520
00:25:04,345 --> 00:25:05,323
Look, Ma,

521
00:25:06,890 --> 00:25:07,723
I met a girl.

522
00:25:10,860 --> 00:25:11,983
She's Italian.

523
00:25:13,410 --> 00:25:14,477
- So I know the family?

524
00:25:14,477 --> 00:25:16,650
- I don't even know her family yet.

525
00:25:16,650 --> 00:25:17,807
- When do I meet her?

526
00:25:20,169 --> 00:25:21,169
- I'm working on it.

527
00:25:23,375 --> 00:25:27,375
- [Priest] Come on, come
on, come, on all right.

528
00:25:28,751 --> 00:25:31,290
- Excuse me, Father.
(church bells ringing)

529
00:25:31,290 --> 00:25:32,123
- Yes son, can I help you?

530
00:25:32,123 --> 00:25:33,190
- Good day, Father.

531
00:25:33,190 --> 00:25:34,814
Maria Caprefoli, is this where she works?

532
00:25:34,814 --> 00:25:36,220
- Yes, but she's not here.

533
00:25:36,220 --> 00:25:37,230
- Well, she said Wednesday.

534
00:25:37,230 --> 00:25:39,160
- Maria had to leave early, Are you Steve?

535
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:40,230
- Yeah.

536
00:25:40,230 --> 00:25:41,870
- She left this for you.

537
00:25:41,870 --> 00:25:43,490
She thought you might come.

538
00:25:43,490 --> 00:25:44,340
Her phone number.

539
00:25:45,750 --> 00:25:46,943
Why don't we walk, hmm?

540
00:25:49,590 --> 00:25:52,770
You see, I have known Maria
since she came to this country.

541
00:25:52,770 --> 00:25:54,278
Did you know she was born in Italy?

542
00:25:54,278 --> 00:25:56,250
- No, she didn't mention it.

543
00:25:56,250 --> 00:25:58,050
- Well, there are many
things that is awkward

544
00:25:58,050 --> 00:25:59,190
for her to talk about.

545
00:25:59,190 --> 00:26:01,850
And please don't think that
I'm trying to interfere

546
00:26:01,850 --> 00:26:03,850
but sometimes it helps to know things

547
00:26:03,850 --> 00:26:05,440
for us to make intelligent decisions.

548
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:08,070
- Yeah, sure. Is there a problem?

549
00:26:08,070 --> 00:26:10,710
- Well that you will have to decide.

550
00:26:10,710 --> 00:26:13,670
Maria came to America after
her own parents were killed.

551
00:26:13,670 --> 00:26:16,110
Since then she has lived
here with her godparents.

552
00:26:16,110 --> 00:26:16,943
- See, I didn't know that either.

553
00:26:16,943 --> 00:26:18,143
I guess there's a lot I
got to learn about her.

554
00:26:18,143 --> 00:26:20,700
- Yeah son, I think perhaps the
most important thing to know

555
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:23,380
before you call her,
is that her godfather,

556
00:26:23,380 --> 00:26:25,930
who was like a real father to her,

557
00:26:25,930 --> 00:26:27,693
his name is not Caprefoli.

558
00:26:28,890 --> 00:26:30,533
His name is Carlo Gambino.

559
00:26:31,940 --> 00:26:34,330
We cannot choose our families.

560
00:26:34,330 --> 00:26:36,733
I hope in time Maria
will choose her own life.

561
00:26:37,810 --> 00:26:38,940
Yes.

562
00:26:38,940 --> 00:26:41,675
So if you should decide not to call,

563
00:26:41,675 --> 00:26:45,223
she will understand.
(soft music)

564
00:26:52,666 --> 00:26:53,530
- Hey, hey, what are you doing?

565
00:26:53,530 --> 00:26:54,363
- Just checking they ain't wired.

566
00:26:54,363 --> 00:26:55,806
- Hey, those cost me 10 bucks.

567
00:26:55,806 --> 00:26:57,980
- You ain't worried, are you?

568
00:27:03,270 --> 00:27:04,270
Have a nice evening.

569
00:27:05,330 --> 00:27:06,540
- Lovely flowers.

570
00:27:06,540 --> 00:27:07,373
- You should have seen 'em

571
00:27:07,373 --> 00:27:10,131
before they were stripped searched.

572
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:13,050
- Can you put these in some water for me?

573
00:27:13,050 --> 00:27:14,620
- Yeah, sure.

574
00:27:14,620 --> 00:27:15,687
See yas later.

575
00:27:15,687 --> 00:27:17,312
But not too much later.

576
00:27:17,312 --> 00:27:20,395
(soft Italian music)

577
00:27:23,484 --> 00:27:25,260
- Thank you, gentleman.

578
00:27:25,260 --> 00:27:26,310
- Hey, I'm over here.

579
00:27:31,212 --> 00:27:33,650
- I'm just not used to
double dating with three guys

580
00:27:33,650 --> 00:27:35,240
and one girl.

581
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:36,710
- Really?

582
00:27:36,710 --> 00:27:38,760
Didn't realize you were so old fashioned.

583
00:27:41,391 --> 00:27:43,440
I know, it's a bit of a drag.

584
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:44,740
But that's just my family.

585
00:27:45,610 --> 00:27:46,520
- Hey, at least we don't have to worry

586
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:47,920
about getting mugged, right?

587
00:27:49,580 --> 00:27:53,400
- So you haven't mentioned,
how's the photography going?

588
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:54,650
- Fine.

589
00:27:54,650 --> 00:27:57,310
I got nothing a couple
of weddings won't fix.

590
00:27:57,310 --> 00:27:58,750
- But you're sticking with it?

591
00:27:58,750 --> 00:28:00,689
- Yeah. Hey, what else
is there for me to do?

592
00:28:00,689 --> 00:28:03,613
- Well, you could always go to
work for the Gambino family.

593
00:28:05,790 --> 00:28:08,130
You didn't think that I would find out?

594
00:28:08,130 --> 00:28:09,717
- I didn't know you were a part of this.

595
00:28:09,717 --> 00:28:10,550
- I'm not.

596
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:12,500
I'm just the goddaughter,

597
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:15,010
but when Poppy hears I'm going on a date

598
00:28:15,010 --> 00:28:17,510
he wants to know who with
and people check around.

599
00:28:20,309 --> 00:28:21,142
- Does it bother you?

600
00:28:21,142 --> 00:28:23,870
- What you do for a
living is your business.

601
00:28:23,870 --> 00:28:25,590
That you didn't tell me, yes.

602
00:28:25,590 --> 00:28:26,423
- I didn't know who you were at first,

603
00:28:26,423 --> 00:28:27,767
not until I talked to Father Anselmo.

604
00:28:29,750 --> 00:28:30,583
I didn't want you to thinking

605
00:28:30,583 --> 00:28:32,443
that I was trying to
get ahead through you.

606
00:28:35,020 --> 00:28:35,970
Can you believe me?

607
00:28:38,208 --> 00:28:40,291
- Those two still up front?

608
00:28:40,291 --> 00:28:41,124
- Yeah.

609
00:28:42,163 --> 00:28:44,094
Why?

610
00:28:44,094 --> 00:28:45,880
- I think we should ditch 'em.

611
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:46,713
- What?

612
00:28:46,713 --> 00:28:48,797
- Give me your car keys.

613
00:28:48,797 --> 00:28:50,080
- You think these guys get a thrill

614
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:51,880
out of watching us eat spaghetti?

615
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:53,640
If you want to be tailed,
talk to Don Carlo about that.

616
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:55,540
Don't take it out on these two chumps.

617
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:03,040
Okay, I guess you want
me to take you home now.

618
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:03,873
- No.

619
00:29:05,526 --> 00:29:07,035
I believe you.

620
00:29:07,035 --> 00:29:08,671
- You believe what?

621
00:29:08,671 --> 00:29:11,973
- That you didn't ask me out
just to help your career.

622
00:29:11,973 --> 00:29:14,390
(soft music)

623
00:29:15,978 --> 00:29:16,978
- Thank you.

624
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:19,120
- Thank you.

625
00:29:25,062 --> 00:29:25,895
- Salute.

626
00:29:27,505 --> 00:29:28,939
- Yeah, salute.

627
00:29:28,939 --> 00:29:31,689
(Maria laughing)

628
00:29:49,523 --> 00:29:52,142
- Thanks, for not letting me be a brat.

629
00:29:52,142 --> 00:29:53,161
(both laughing)

630
00:29:53,161 --> 00:29:54,350
I had a really good time.

631
00:29:54,350 --> 00:29:55,183
- Me too.

632
00:29:56,286 --> 00:29:58,550
Maybe we can do it again sometime.

633
00:29:58,550 --> 00:30:00,534
Just the four of us.
(Maria laughing)

634
00:30:00,534 --> 00:30:01,701
- I'd love to.

635
00:30:09,353 --> 00:30:10,186
Goodnight.

636
00:30:25,118 --> 00:30:28,285
(car engine starting)

637
00:30:40,437 --> 00:30:43,412
(man coughing)

638
00:30:43,412 --> 00:30:44,495
- Don Carlo.

639
00:30:48,540 --> 00:30:50,830
Colombo's going ahead with
the Italian American rally

640
00:30:50,830 --> 00:30:52,260
in spite of your wishes.

641
00:30:52,260 --> 00:30:53,110
What shall we do?

642
00:30:55,330 --> 00:30:56,283
- Nothing for now.

643
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:58,800
- About the Collura kid.

644
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:01,940
I had a man break into
his apartment yesterday.

645
00:31:01,940 --> 00:31:02,940
- So?

646
00:31:02,940 --> 00:31:06,480
- Nothing, but he's got this book, this

647
00:31:07,820 --> 00:31:10,803
album full of pictures of Maria.

648
00:31:14,127 --> 00:31:15,680
- What else?

649
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:17,340
- I checked with friends downtown,

650
00:31:17,340 --> 00:31:19,700
he's not on any police payroll.

651
00:31:19,700 --> 00:31:22,123
I think he's legit Don Carlo.

652
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:25,793
I also think he's in love.

653
00:31:26,759 --> 00:31:29,176
(soft music)

654
00:31:47,553 --> 00:31:49,533
- Are you upset?
- No.

655
00:31:53,481 --> 00:31:57,490
- I'm feeling these feelings
and I don't want to mess up.

656
00:31:57,490 --> 00:31:58,323
- You won't.

657
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:12,953
- I've never been with
a woman like you before.

658
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:16,273
- It's never been like this for me either.

659
00:32:21,289 --> 00:32:25,901
- What you saying, that
we're meant for each other?

660
00:32:25,901 --> 00:32:28,831
- I think it's time you
should meet my family.

661
00:32:28,831 --> 00:32:31,560
(soft music)

662
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:33,410
Poppy wants you to come to dinner Sunday.

663
00:32:33,410 --> 00:32:35,290
- With me? Dinner with Carlo Gambino?

664
00:32:35,290 --> 00:32:37,180
- Well, just think of him as my father.

665
00:32:37,180 --> 00:32:38,519
- Oh, that's supposed
to make me feel relaxed?

666
00:32:38,519 --> 00:32:40,629
What if he doesn't like me?

667
00:32:40,629 --> 00:32:43,380
- Well, I did go out with this one guy

668
00:32:43,380 --> 00:32:44,350
Poppy didn't care for,

669
00:32:44,350 --> 00:32:47,093
but nobody's seen him around
for a long, long time.

670
00:32:48,116 --> 00:32:50,949
(Stevie laughing)

671
00:32:52,493 --> 00:32:54,910
(soft music)

672
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:04,743
Poppy, Mammy.

673
00:33:04,743 --> 00:33:07,090
This is Steve Collura.

674
00:33:07,090 --> 00:33:10,600
Steve, this is my family,
Carlo and Kathryn Gambino.

675
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:12,342
- A pleasure to meet you, Steve.

676
00:33:12,342 --> 00:33:14,142
- Pleased to meet you, Mrs. Gambino.

677
00:33:20,569 --> 00:33:23,720
- Collura. That's Italiano, no?

678
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:25,703
- My dad was from Sicily, Palermo.

679
00:33:27,420 --> 00:33:29,721
- Then you are from Palermo.

680
00:33:29,721 --> 00:33:31,304
- [Paul] Don Carlo.

681
00:33:33,066 --> 00:33:35,770
- Uncle Paul, this is my
friend, Steve Collura.

682
00:33:35,770 --> 00:33:37,739
This is my uncle Paul Castellano.

683
00:33:37,739 --> 00:33:39,860
- I think you're gonna want to see this.

684
00:33:39,860 --> 00:33:42,080
- Today, the Italian
American Civil Rights League

685
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:43,917
picketed the New York offices of the FBI

686
00:33:43,917 --> 00:33:45,490
and to understand why,

687
00:33:45,490 --> 00:33:47,730
we have with us the founder
of the Civil Rights League,

688
00:33:47,730 --> 00:33:49,180
Joseph Colombo.

689
00:33:49,180 --> 00:33:51,470
Mr. Colombo, how could a
man reputed to be the head

690
00:33:51,470 --> 00:33:54,272
of a mafia family complain
of unfair media treatment-

691
00:33:54,272 --> 00:33:55,297
- Will you look at this guy?

692
00:33:55,297 --> 00:33:57,840
- You know, that's exactly
what I'm talking about.

693
00:33:57,840 --> 00:33:59,166
I mean, mafia, mafia.

694
00:33:59,166 --> 00:34:00,890
Well, where the hell is this mafia?

695
00:34:00,890 --> 00:34:03,354
I mean, books, movies, TV.

696
00:34:03,354 --> 00:34:07,130
There ain't no mafia and I
ain't no head of no family

697
00:34:07,130 --> 00:34:08,830
except my wife and kids.

698
00:34:08,830 --> 00:34:09,940
- What's wrong with him?
- I'm a real estate

699
00:34:09,940 --> 00:34:11,160
salesman is what I am.

700
00:34:11,160 --> 00:34:13,211
- Don Carlo, this is
too much attention here.

701
00:34:13,211 --> 00:34:14,973
This guy is gonna
destroy us with all this.

702
00:34:14,973 --> 00:34:18,216
This is suicide here, Don
Carlo, we gotta do something.

703
00:34:18,216 --> 00:34:22,570
(Carlo speaking in Italian)

704
00:34:22,570 --> 00:34:25,210
- [Joseph] I'm a real estate
salesman is what I am.

705
00:34:25,210 --> 00:34:26,490
And I ain't just concerned about myself-

706
00:34:26,490 --> 00:34:28,516
- This guy is no problem.

707
00:34:28,516 --> 00:34:30,840
Who's gonna watch this cafone anyway?

708
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:31,850
Put something else on.

709
00:34:31,850 --> 00:34:33,832
- [Joseph] You know, my parents
were great, proud Americans.

710
00:34:33,832 --> 00:34:35,990
(channels changing)

711
00:34:35,990 --> 00:34:37,573
- I'm sorry, Maria.

712
00:34:43,420 --> 00:34:47,080
Steve, come with me, I want
to show you my flowers.

713
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:47,913
Come on.

714
00:34:52,900 --> 00:34:55,891
Back in Sicily, Maria's mother and father

715
00:34:55,891 --> 00:34:57,483
were my good friends.

716
00:34:59,470 --> 00:35:02,120
I held her in her baptism
when she was a little baby.

717
00:35:03,300 --> 00:35:04,200
She was beautiful.

718
00:35:06,630 --> 00:35:07,463
And then,

719
00:35:10,331 --> 00:35:12,797
her mother and her father
were killed in Veneto.

720
00:35:15,967 --> 00:35:17,653
Maria was left all alone.

721
00:35:18,860 --> 00:35:21,010
So I brought it to this country.

722
00:35:21,010 --> 00:35:23,053
I wanted her to grow up in peace.

723
00:35:24,070 --> 00:35:25,270
I have many godchildren.

724
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:27,963
They live here.

725
00:35:29,115 --> 00:35:29,948
But Maria,

726
00:35:32,890 --> 00:35:33,723
she lives here.

727
00:35:36,150 --> 00:35:36,983
Hmm.

728
00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:39,903
A lot of young men are after Maria.

729
00:35:41,650 --> 00:35:42,483
And why not?

730
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:45,040
She's beautiful.

731
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:45,980
She's intelligent.

732
00:35:45,980 --> 00:35:47,053
She's well-connected.

733
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:51,340
She's a good catch for
somebody like you, huh?

734
00:35:51,340 --> 00:35:52,710
- If that's what you think
I'll quit working for you

735
00:35:52,710 --> 00:35:54,270
right now and go back to taking pictures.

736
00:35:54,270 --> 00:35:56,183
- No, that's not what I mean.

737
00:35:59,330 --> 00:36:01,743
Maria is gonna have to share you with me

738
00:36:01,743 --> 00:36:03,570
because I got two families

739
00:36:04,690 --> 00:36:06,890
and you've got a place
and a future in both.

740
00:36:07,780 --> 00:36:09,493
- And I pledge my loyalty to both.

741
00:36:10,963 --> 00:36:11,796
- Loyalty.

742
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:14,100
- My father used to say without loyalty,

743
00:36:14,100 --> 00:36:15,780
we are like the animals.

744
00:36:15,780 --> 00:36:16,870
- You're father was right.

745
00:36:16,870 --> 00:36:19,673
And now you got a family
that's loyal to you.

746
00:36:21,260 --> 00:36:25,122
And that loyalty is more
important than your own life.

747
00:36:25,122 --> 00:36:28,205
(suspenseful music)

748
00:36:30,510 --> 00:36:32,180
- It doesn't make sense.

749
00:36:32,180 --> 00:36:34,460
Two months ago, you're
a part-time soldier.

750
00:36:34,460 --> 00:36:36,310
Now you're chauffeuring the Capo's?

751
00:36:36,310 --> 00:36:38,250
Having heart to hearts with Gambino?

752
00:36:38,250 --> 00:36:39,083
Something's wrong.

753
00:36:39,083 --> 00:36:40,890
- I don't understand you.

754
00:36:40,890 --> 00:36:42,880
You bring me in because
you think I can do a job.

755
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:43,713
I do the job.

756
00:36:43,713 --> 00:36:45,240
Then you give me a hard time.

757
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:47,430
- I'm responsible for your safety.

758
00:36:47,430 --> 00:36:48,263
Maybe I should pull you out.

759
00:36:48,263 --> 00:36:50,190
- Out of the family? You can't do that.

760
00:36:50,190 --> 00:36:51,633
- Oh, why not?

761
00:36:52,670 --> 00:36:54,450
There's something you're not telling me?

762
00:36:54,450 --> 00:36:55,610
- Like what?

763
00:36:55,610 --> 00:36:57,040
- I don't know.

764
00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:59,080
It's getting too risky.

765
00:36:59,080 --> 00:37:00,190
- But that's why you brought me in.

766
00:37:00,190 --> 00:37:02,340
I'm the guy that likes
to live on the edge.

767
00:37:03,330 --> 00:37:05,830
Look, you need me and I need this.

768
00:37:05,830 --> 00:37:07,010
- Mm-hmm.

769
00:37:07,010 --> 00:37:10,270
So, I got myself an adrenaline junkie.

770
00:37:10,270 --> 00:37:12,750
- Yeah, you gonna leave me there?

771
00:37:12,750 --> 00:37:15,000
- Joey Gallo gets out
of the joint tomorrow

772
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,450
and some people are gonna get dead.

773
00:37:17,450 --> 00:37:18,930
We need all the help we can get.

774
00:37:18,930 --> 00:37:21,660
That's the only reason
I'm leaving you in there.

775
00:37:21,660 --> 00:37:24,290
- So I run into Joey
Gallo, I should thank him?

776
00:37:24,290 --> 00:37:26,760
- You run into crazy Joey, keep running.

777
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:29,770
You don't want to know
how he earned that name.

778
00:37:29,770 --> 00:37:31,170
Trust me, Stevie,

779
00:37:31,170 --> 00:37:33,200
there's gonna be blood on the streets.

780
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:35,200
I just don't want any of it to be yours.

781
00:37:38,788 --> 00:37:41,205
(door opens)

782
00:37:50,307 --> 00:37:52,724
(door opens)

783
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:00,903
- Don Carlo, Joey Gallo has
come to pay his respects.

784
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:03,010
- Don Carlo.

785
00:38:03,010 --> 00:38:04,210
Thank you for seeing me.

786
00:38:05,120 --> 00:38:06,503
- Joey Gallo, Joey.

787
00:38:08,473 --> 00:38:10,480
(speaking in Italian)

788
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:11,453
It's been too long.

789
00:38:12,430 --> 00:38:14,065
- Eight years hard time.

790
00:38:14,065 --> 00:38:17,044
(speaking in Italian)

791
00:38:17,044 --> 00:38:18,020
Deaf and dumb.

792
00:38:18,020 --> 00:38:19,980
I didn't rat nobody out.

793
00:38:19,980 --> 00:38:22,256
- As you have sworn, so you did.

794
00:38:22,256 --> 00:38:24,520
- A lot of people swore a lot of things.

795
00:38:24,520 --> 00:38:26,026
Like Joey Colombo, he swore
that he was gonna protect

796
00:38:26,026 --> 00:38:29,070
my operation until I got
out and what does he do?

797
00:38:29,070 --> 00:38:30,359
Steals from me.

798
00:38:30,359 --> 00:38:31,310
Rapes me.

799
00:38:31,310 --> 00:38:33,260
(Carlo laughing)

800
00:38:33,260 --> 00:38:34,510
- So what do we do, Joey?

801
00:38:37,060 --> 00:38:38,930
Do you want to appeal to him?

802
00:38:38,930 --> 00:38:40,653
- Appeal to him?

803
00:38:40,653 --> 00:38:42,380
Beg him for what's already mine?

804
00:38:42,380 --> 00:38:43,213
The guy's a bug!

805
00:38:43,213 --> 00:38:45,330
He's belong son all fours
in front of me, begging me.

806
00:38:45,330 --> 00:38:46,253
Me beg him?

807
00:38:48,337 --> 00:38:51,370
"I hate victims who respect
their executioners."

808
00:38:51,370 --> 00:38:52,303
Sartre wrote that.

809
00:38:53,380 --> 00:38:55,177
Eight years, Don Carlo.

810
00:38:55,177 --> 00:38:56,483
A lot of time to read.

811
00:38:57,870 --> 00:38:59,993
A lot of time to figure
out who's screwed you.

812
00:39:02,470 --> 00:39:05,603
- So Joey, you're not the only one.

813
00:39:06,529 --> 00:39:09,113
All of us are threatened
by Colombo's speeches.

814
00:39:11,830 --> 00:39:12,663
- Don Carlo,

815
00:39:14,820 --> 00:39:17,543
maybe it's time that Colombo
stops making these speeches.

816
00:39:19,020 --> 00:39:21,419
(projector whirring)

817
00:39:21,419 --> 00:39:23,650
- Now, this is Dino
D'Tosti in from Boston.

818
00:39:23,650 --> 00:39:25,440
He's currently under a federal indictment

819
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:26,633
for labor racketeering.

820
00:39:28,450 --> 00:39:29,916
Hey Dom, how are you doing?

821
00:39:29,916 --> 00:39:31,327
- These the photos from last night?

822
00:39:31,327 --> 00:39:32,387
- Yeah.

823
00:39:32,387 --> 00:39:35,520
It's supposed to be a
wedding party over in Bayonne

824
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:38,300
but we got Capo's here from all over.

825
00:39:38,300 --> 00:39:39,133
Okay, Jack.

826
00:39:40,728 --> 00:39:42,010
Chickee Bavonne.

827
00:39:42,010 --> 00:39:43,903
Two weeks out out of Leavenworth.

828
00:39:43,903 --> 00:39:46,460
- [Dom] What happened to his hair?

829
00:39:46,460 --> 00:39:48,720
- Well, word is he lost
his toupee in the joint

830
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:49,553
in a crap game.

831
00:39:50,599 --> 00:39:52,350
(Dom laughing)

832
00:39:52,350 --> 00:39:53,183
Okay.

833
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:58,040
Now this is Gambino's
goddaughter, Maria Caprefoli.

834
00:39:58,040 --> 00:40:00,140
Does anybody recognize the guy she's with?

835
00:40:05,064 --> 00:40:06,564
No, new one on me.

836
00:40:07,771 --> 00:40:08,604
- It just slipped your mind

837
00:40:08,604 --> 00:40:10,250
you've been dating the boss's
daughter for three months?

838
00:40:10,250 --> 00:40:12,220
- It's got nothing to do with us.

839
00:40:12,220 --> 00:40:13,360
Strictly personal.

840
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:14,870
- Personal? You're a cop!

841
00:40:14,870 --> 00:40:15,860
- Yeah and a damn good one too.

842
00:40:15,860 --> 00:40:17,510
I'm getting stuff
nobody's ever got before,

843
00:40:17,510 --> 00:40:18,660
not even you.

844
00:40:18,660 --> 00:40:19,810
- Stevie, what are you thinking?

845
00:40:19,810 --> 00:40:21,970
Gambino's gonna let you
walk away with his princess?

846
00:40:21,970 --> 00:40:22,843
One day, you're gonna be
strolling down the aisle,

847
00:40:22,843 --> 00:40:24,290
wearing a tuxedo?

848
00:40:24,290 --> 00:40:26,280
The only tuxedo you're gonna
be wearing is in a pine box!

849
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:27,170
- Don't worry about it, all right?

850
00:40:27,170 --> 00:40:28,360
We'll find a way out.

851
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:29,490
- I remember that song.

852
00:40:29,490 --> 00:40:30,730
That's from West Side Story.

853
00:40:30,730 --> 00:40:32,280
This ain't a musical, Stevie!

854
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:33,300
When you get a knife in the gut,

855
00:40:33,300 --> 00:40:34,780
you don't come out for curtain call.

856
00:40:34,780 --> 00:40:35,840
- That would make you happy, wouldn't it?

857
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:36,990
Prove you were right, huh?

858
00:40:36,990 --> 00:40:38,500
- I don't need to prove nothing.

859
00:40:38,500 --> 00:40:39,821
I've been there and I know

860
00:40:39,821 --> 00:40:41,470
you can't keep this stuff separate.

861
00:40:41,470 --> 00:40:42,840
- Maybe you can't, but I can.

862
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:44,520
I promised you I do you
a job and I'm doing it.

863
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:45,973
I can promise you my life.

864
00:40:57,098 --> 00:40:59,848
(birds chirping)

865
00:41:00,812 --> 00:41:01,645
- Mm.

866
00:41:04,052 --> 00:41:06,140
Where are we?

867
00:41:06,140 --> 00:41:06,990
Iowa?

868
00:41:06,990 --> 00:41:08,903
- Hmm. Connecticut.

869
00:41:10,710 --> 00:41:11,920
- It's beautiful.

870
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:13,472
- Yeah, the scenery's not bad either.

871
00:41:13,472 --> 00:41:16,409
(soft music)

872
00:41:16,409 --> 00:41:17,242
- Mm.

873
00:41:22,063 --> 00:41:24,134
(Maria laughing)

874
00:41:24,134 --> 00:41:26,551
(soft music)

875
00:41:28,828 --> 00:41:32,745
(Maria screaming and laughing)

876
00:41:38,707 --> 00:41:40,540
- Come on!
- Let me up!

877
00:41:44,287 --> 00:41:45,840
This is a long way to go for a walk.

878
00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:47,263
Haven't you ever heard of Central Park?

879
00:41:47,263 --> 00:41:48,360
- Well, I wanted you to know there's more

880
00:41:48,360 --> 00:41:50,193
to life than the city.

881
00:41:52,539 --> 00:41:53,950
We could live out here someday.

882
00:41:53,950 --> 00:41:56,318
- In the country?
- Yeah.

883
00:41:56,318 --> 00:41:57,243
Out west.

884
00:41:58,898 --> 00:42:00,071
We can have a ranch.

885
00:42:00,071 --> 00:42:01,060
- A ranch?

886
00:42:01,060 --> 00:42:03,603
What would you do on a ranch?

887
00:42:04,690 --> 00:42:06,126
What would I do on a ranch?

888
00:42:06,126 --> 00:42:07,059
- Hey, what's the matter?

889
00:42:07,059 --> 00:42:08,331
I would find something.

890
00:42:08,331 --> 00:42:09,771
Right?

891
00:42:09,771 --> 00:42:12,521
As long as we're together, right?

892
00:42:14,120 --> 00:42:15,563
- What is it?

893
00:42:15,563 --> 00:42:16,793
It's the job, right?

894
00:42:18,370 --> 00:42:19,913
So be a photographer.

895
00:42:20,824 --> 00:42:22,670
Are you afraid Poppy wouldn't approve?

896
00:42:22,670 --> 00:42:26,085
Don't you know that whatever
makes me happy makes him happy?

897
00:42:26,085 --> 00:42:27,790
- He'll still be there.

898
00:42:27,790 --> 00:42:28,983
We can never get away.

899
00:42:30,234 --> 00:42:31,683
- Why would we want to?

900
00:42:33,150 --> 00:42:35,093
Poppy saved my life, I can't leave.

901
00:42:37,284 --> 00:42:39,670
And there is loyalty and I
know you feel the same way

902
00:42:39,670 --> 00:42:41,320
because he told me what you said.

903
00:42:44,850 --> 00:42:45,848
Maybe you're just getting cold feet

904
00:42:45,848 --> 00:42:46,804
and you want to go west without me.

905
00:42:46,804 --> 00:42:48,223
- Don't even joke.

906
00:42:49,386 --> 00:42:51,276
I don't want any life without you.

907
00:42:51,276 --> 00:42:53,693
(soft music)

908
00:43:14,743 --> 00:43:16,280
- Park the car, then come inside.

909
00:43:16,280 --> 00:43:18,190
Don Carlo wants you in the meeting.

910
00:43:18,190 --> 00:43:19,660
- Me?

911
00:43:19,660 --> 00:43:21,630
Wait, something the
matter, Mr. Castellano?

912
00:43:21,630 --> 00:43:23,473
- Relax kid, it's a big honor.

913
00:43:23,473 --> 00:43:25,123
- Yeah. What am I supposed to do?

914
00:43:26,080 --> 00:43:28,180
- Keep your ears open and your mouth shut.

915
00:43:31,010 --> 00:43:32,550
- So gentlemen, like I was saying,

916
00:43:32,550 --> 00:43:35,020
we told the cops we ain't
having nothing to do

917
00:43:35,020 --> 00:43:38,900
with Joey Colombo's Italian
American civil rights stuff.

918
00:43:38,900 --> 00:43:41,120
And Don Carlo, I put the word out.

919
00:43:41,120 --> 00:43:43,613
No businesses are closed
for Colombo's rally.

920
00:43:44,665 --> 00:43:47,867
(Carlo speaking Italian)

921
00:43:47,867 --> 00:43:51,117
(all speaking Italian)

922
00:44:01,530 --> 00:44:02,363
- Stevie.

923
00:44:04,040 --> 00:44:04,873
Come here.

924
00:44:05,710 --> 00:44:06,543
Sit down.

925
00:44:09,077 --> 00:44:10,023
So, you listen?

926
00:44:12,080 --> 00:44:12,913
Good.

927
00:44:14,130 --> 00:44:17,490
And what do the young
men on the street say?

928
00:44:17,490 --> 00:44:18,503
- Don't Carlo, it's not my place.

929
00:44:18,503 --> 00:44:21,773
- I'm asking you so it is your place.

930
00:44:24,730 --> 00:44:25,567
- Mostly the Joe Colombo thing

931
00:44:25,567 --> 00:44:27,180
and all the noise he's making.

932
00:44:27,180 --> 00:44:29,830
Plus with Joey Gallo back
in town, everybody's tense.

933
00:44:32,651 --> 00:44:36,137
- You know, this Joe Columbo,
Italian American Day.

934
00:44:37,550 --> 00:44:38,550
It's awkward for me.

935
00:44:40,060 --> 00:44:41,480
I disapprove so I can't be there.

936
00:44:41,480 --> 00:44:44,223
So I wanna ask you,

937
00:44:45,810 --> 00:44:46,863
could you go there?

938
00:44:48,187 --> 00:44:50,300
And you'll be my eyes and my ears,

939
00:44:50,300 --> 00:44:52,890
would you do me that favor?

940
00:44:52,890 --> 00:44:55,423
- Don Carlo, absolutely.
- Good.

941
00:44:56,582 --> 00:44:59,160
And then you come back and we talk.

942
00:44:59,160 --> 00:44:59,993
All right?

943
00:45:03,003 --> 00:45:04,680
And how are things with you?

944
00:45:04,680 --> 00:45:05,513
- Great.

945
00:45:06,830 --> 00:45:07,793
I'm learning a lot.

946
00:45:08,761 --> 00:45:10,143
- And with you and Maria?

947
00:45:11,890 --> 00:45:13,023
- It's terrific.

948
00:45:15,780 --> 00:45:16,613
I'd, uh,

949
00:45:17,460 --> 00:45:19,943
with your permission, Don Carlo,

950
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:23,470
I'd like you to meet my family.

951
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:27,233
- Sure.

952
00:45:28,970 --> 00:45:31,244
- Thank you, Don Carlo.

953
00:45:31,244 --> 00:45:32,077
- Thanks.

954
00:45:40,590 --> 00:45:41,757
- My wife and I would like to know

955
00:45:41,757 --> 00:45:43,230
what's a beautiful girl like you

956
00:45:43,230 --> 00:45:44,920
doing with a bum like him, huh?

957
00:45:44,920 --> 00:45:46,240
Oh, I know, he promised
to to take your picture,

958
00:45:46,240 --> 00:45:48,100
make you a big movie star, huh?

959
00:45:48,100 --> 00:45:49,550
- I'm not an actress.

960
00:45:49,550 --> 00:45:51,370
I'm starting to be a teacher.

961
00:45:51,370 --> 00:45:52,690
- Yeah, smart guy.

962
00:45:52,690 --> 00:45:53,523
Special education at NYU.

963
00:45:53,523 --> 00:45:56,130
She works with the kids at Saint Genesius.

964
00:45:56,130 --> 00:45:57,233
- That's nice.

965
00:45:59,198 --> 00:46:01,290
And you grew up in Brooklyn?

966
00:46:01,290 --> 00:46:03,473
- Yes, but I was born in Italy.

967
00:46:04,370 --> 00:46:06,300
- You're first generation.

968
00:46:06,300 --> 00:46:08,570
I'm first generation also.

969
00:46:08,570 --> 00:46:11,110
Steven here is second generation.

970
00:46:11,110 --> 00:46:12,793
Aren't you, Steven?
- Steven?

971
00:46:14,990 --> 00:46:17,121
- Your folks still live in Brooklyn?

972
00:46:17,121 --> 00:46:19,970
- Well, actually my parents
died when I was very young

973
00:46:19,970 --> 00:46:22,728
and I was raised by my godparents.

974
00:46:22,728 --> 00:46:23,561
- Oh.

975
00:46:25,230 --> 00:46:28,843
I knew some Caprefolis over in Queens.

976
00:46:29,690 --> 00:46:30,723
Very nice people.

977
00:46:35,130 --> 00:46:37,430
- My godparents are
Kathryn and Carlo Gambino.

978
00:46:43,427 --> 00:46:44,975
(Maria sighing)

979
00:46:44,975 --> 00:46:46,210
- All right, before you say anything-

980
00:46:46,210 --> 00:46:47,463
- Look, Steve, I can make
this real easy for you.

981
00:46:47,463 --> 00:46:49,360
- I don't want easy.

982
00:46:49,360 --> 00:46:50,483
- No, good?

983
00:46:51,613 --> 00:46:53,763
Then the hell with what
your family thinks.

984
00:46:54,890 --> 00:46:56,130
All that matters is us.

985
00:46:56,130 --> 00:46:57,180
- Yeah, that's right.

986
00:46:58,180 --> 00:46:59,080
I'll tell 'em that

987
00:47:01,463 --> 00:47:02,790
- But be sure to tell them

988
00:47:02,790 --> 00:47:05,023
that we'd love to have
them at our wedding.

989
00:47:05,023 --> 00:47:07,440
(soft music)

990
00:47:08,680 --> 00:47:10,580
You do want to marry me, don't you?

991
00:47:11,478 --> 00:47:15,690
(car honking)
(tires screech)

992
00:47:15,690 --> 00:47:17,730
- Yeah. Yeah. The Columbus Circle thing.

993
00:47:17,730 --> 00:47:19,523
He wants me to be his eyes and his ears.

994
00:47:28,070 --> 00:47:29,620
Damn, it's Paul Raggio, he see's me.

995
00:47:29,620 --> 00:47:30,620
I'll call you later.

996
00:47:40,690 --> 00:47:42,090
- Hey Petey, is Maria there?

997
00:47:43,274 --> 00:47:45,107
Ah, just tell her I called.

998
00:47:52,060 --> 00:47:53,050
Hey, Raggio, how you doing?

999
00:47:53,050 --> 00:47:55,470
- Collura, you live
around here, don't you?

1000
00:47:55,470 --> 00:47:57,109
- Yeah. Right there.

1001
00:47:57,109 --> 00:47:59,383
- Your phone out of order?
- No. Why?

1002
00:48:02,270 --> 00:48:03,103
- Oh yeah. I see what you mean.

1003
00:48:03,103 --> 00:48:06,282
No, I just didn't want to
take a chance it was bugged.

1004
00:48:06,282 --> 00:48:07,832
- Who the hell's gonna bug you?

1005
00:48:08,877 --> 00:48:09,910
- I'm just trying to learn from you guys.

1006
00:48:09,910 --> 00:48:11,360
You know? Doing the smart thing.

1007
00:48:11,360 --> 00:48:12,193
- Yeah?

1008
00:48:13,350 --> 00:48:16,200
- So who you calling that you
don't want the FBI to hear?

1009
00:48:18,670 --> 00:48:19,663
- Maria Caprefoli.

1010
00:48:21,540 --> 00:48:22,690
- You didn't talk long.

1011
00:48:24,423 --> 00:48:25,670
- She wasn't home.

1012
00:48:25,670 --> 00:48:26,670
I'll call her later.

1013
00:48:29,864 --> 00:48:31,460
- Yeah, you do that.

1014
00:48:38,200 --> 00:48:39,033
Petey?
- Yo.

1015
00:48:39,033 --> 00:48:41,093
- You on the phones tonight?
- Yep.

1016
00:48:41,093 --> 00:48:43,156
- Anybody call the last hour?

1017
00:48:43,156 --> 00:48:44,147
- [Petey] Steve Collura called for Maria

1018
00:48:44,147 --> 00:48:46,210
about half hour ago.

1019
00:48:46,210 --> 00:48:47,043
She wasn't here.

1020
00:48:47,990 --> 00:48:49,520
Any problem?

1021
00:48:49,520 --> 00:48:51,183
- No, no problem.

1022
00:48:55,910 --> 00:48:57,920
- [Reporter] Again, this
late breaking story.

1023
00:48:57,920 --> 00:49:01,090
Joseph Colombo, reputed head
of the Colombo crime family,

1024
00:49:01,090 --> 00:49:03,680
and leader of the Italian
American Civil Rights League

1025
00:49:03,680 --> 00:49:05,870
was shot this afternoon
at the Unity Day rally

1026
00:49:05,870 --> 00:49:07,340
in Columbus Circle.

1027
00:49:07,340 --> 00:49:09,022
First reports indicate that
his assassin was killed-

1028
00:49:09,022 --> 00:49:10,570
- It's okay, he's one of ours.
- At the scene

1029
00:49:10,570 --> 00:49:12,370
by unknown parties.

1030
00:49:12,370 --> 00:49:14,933
Colombo's condition is listed as critical.

1031
00:49:18,800 --> 00:49:19,633
- You heard?

1032
00:49:21,540 --> 00:49:22,490
- What did you see?

1033
00:49:24,140 --> 00:49:24,973
- Everything.

1034
00:49:26,090 --> 00:49:29,890
They're just getting ready
to start, Colombo's, uh,

1035
00:49:29,890 --> 00:49:32,680
he's talking to people,
he's shaking hands.

1036
00:49:32,680 --> 00:49:33,750
This black guy's following him around

1037
00:49:33,750 --> 00:49:35,160
taking pictures for about 10 minutes.

1038
00:49:35,160 --> 00:49:36,290
All of a sudden he drops his camera

1039
00:49:36,290 --> 00:49:38,870
and he pulls out his piece, pop, pop, pop.

1040
00:49:38,870 --> 00:49:40,780
Puts three into Colombo's head.

1041
00:49:40,780 --> 00:49:42,530
- And the one with the gun?

1042
00:49:42,530 --> 00:49:43,730
- Oh, he's dead.

1043
00:49:43,730 --> 00:49:45,690
Somebody whacked him out right away.

1044
00:49:45,690 --> 00:49:46,640
I couldn't see who.

1045
00:49:47,610 --> 00:49:48,443
- It was crazy.

1046
00:49:48,443 --> 00:49:49,883
There was people running around screaming.

1047
00:49:52,120 --> 00:49:54,270
Why some black guy want
to hit Joe Colombo?

1048
00:49:55,330 --> 00:49:57,680
- We heard he was in the
joint with Joey Gallo.

1049
00:50:01,020 --> 00:50:04,180
- Well, Colombo ain't dead,
he's gonna be a vegetable.

1050
00:50:04,180 --> 00:50:07,140
- And maybe somebody should
plant him in a garden.

1051
00:50:07,140 --> 00:50:07,973
- Steve,

1052
00:50:09,280 --> 00:50:10,321
you've done very well.

1053
00:50:10,321 --> 00:50:13,230
(speaking Italian)

1054
00:50:13,230 --> 00:50:14,713
- Thank you, Don Carlo.

1055
00:50:18,193 --> 00:50:20,693
(soft music)

1056
00:50:38,131 --> 00:50:40,900
- And now we have a special dedication

1057
00:50:40,900 --> 00:50:43,533
for Mr and Mrs. Steve Collura.

1058
00:50:44,601 --> 00:50:47,018
(soft music)

1059
00:50:51,433 --> 00:50:54,766
- You did that?
- It's how we registered.

1060
00:50:56,850 --> 00:50:58,330
You should have seen how
badly your hand shook

1061
00:50:58,330 --> 00:51:00,113
when you signed us in.

1062
00:51:00,113 --> 00:51:03,630
- Oh, like you're not nervous
about spending the night?

1063
00:51:03,630 --> 00:51:06,530
- We're engaged and anyway
it's time I knew if you snored.

1064
00:51:08,737 --> 00:51:10,987
(laughing)

1065
00:51:15,870 --> 00:51:18,410
- Does Don Carlo know where you are?

1066
00:51:18,410 --> 00:51:19,243
- Yes.

1067
00:51:20,236 --> 00:51:21,657
- He must trust you a lot.

1068
00:51:22,730 --> 00:51:25,823
- Me, a little. You, completely.

1069
00:51:28,721 --> 00:51:29,554
- He said that?

1070
00:51:31,211 --> 00:51:33,361
- Don't you know how
much he cares for you?

1071
00:51:34,349 --> 00:51:36,057
Does that bother you?

1072
00:51:36,057 --> 00:51:39,807
- No. I just don't ever
want to let him down.

1073
00:51:40,690 --> 00:51:41,557
- Why would you?

1074
00:51:42,826 --> 00:51:43,659
Hmm?

1075
00:51:45,549 --> 00:51:48,299
Mrs. Collura would like to dance.

1076
00:51:59,967 --> 00:52:02,467
(door creaks)

1077
00:52:08,436 --> 00:52:11,269
(sexy sax music)

1078
00:53:37,395 --> 00:53:38,395
- I'm sorry.

1079
00:53:44,196 --> 00:53:46,779
I can't.
- It's okay, it's okay.

1080
00:53:48,466 --> 00:53:51,434
You want to wait till we're
married? I understand.

1081
00:53:51,434 --> 00:53:52,267
- No.

1082
00:53:54,434 --> 00:53:56,101
It's not the reason.

1083
00:54:00,718 --> 00:54:01,635
- Is it me?

1084
00:54:03,031 --> 00:54:05,960
- Do you remember our first date?

1085
00:54:05,960 --> 00:54:09,430
And I told you that I knew
you working for the family

1086
00:54:09,430 --> 00:54:10,430
but that it was okay

1087
00:54:11,340 --> 00:54:12,717
and that I didn't care what you did

1088
00:54:12,717 --> 00:54:15,157
as long as you were being honest with me?

1089
00:54:15,157 --> 00:54:15,990
- Yeah.

1090
00:54:17,387 --> 00:54:19,287
- Well I wasn't being honest with you.

1091
00:54:21,180 --> 00:54:22,830
Because now I'm looking
at the rest of my life

1092
00:54:22,830 --> 00:54:23,663
and what you do.

1093
00:54:26,396 --> 00:54:27,313
It does matter.

1094
00:54:30,374 --> 00:54:31,207
It does.

1095
00:54:35,875 --> 00:54:37,943
- Look, I have a
confession to make to you.

1096
00:54:39,993 --> 00:54:42,243
I haven't been completely honest with you.

1097
00:54:43,546 --> 00:54:44,629
- What is it?

1098
00:54:51,115 --> 00:54:52,363
- It's a business, a family business.

1099
00:54:54,720 --> 00:54:56,763
It's not something I intend to do forever.

1100
00:54:59,170 --> 00:55:00,220
- Do you mean that?

1101
00:55:00,220 --> 00:55:01,230
- Yeah, I've been
thinking about for awhile.

1102
00:55:01,230 --> 00:55:04,033
It's just, I wasn't sure
how you feel about it.

1103
00:55:09,412 --> 00:55:11,829
(soft music)

1104
00:55:14,280 --> 00:55:17,505
And maybe we should
wait till we're married.

1105
00:55:17,505 --> 00:55:20,073
I kind of like the idea
of marrying a virgin.

1106
00:55:20,073 --> 00:55:22,823
(Maria laughing)

1107
00:55:31,020 --> 00:55:32,500
- Absolutely not, Cellini.

1108
00:55:32,500 --> 00:55:34,820
You are not pulling him
out and that is an order.

1109
00:55:34,820 --> 00:55:37,300
- Inspector, he's engaged
to Gambino's goddaughter.

1110
00:55:37,300 --> 00:55:38,133
He's my undercover

1111
00:55:38,133 --> 00:55:39,530
and I got to read about in the damn paper.

1112
00:55:39,530 --> 00:55:41,490
- So what? You didn't
get invited to the party?

1113
00:55:41,490 --> 00:55:44,100
We have never had anybody
this close to the top.

1114
00:55:44,100 --> 00:55:46,640
He has given us gold, Cellini, gold.

1115
00:55:46,640 --> 00:55:48,240
- The dumb bastard's
gonna get himself killed.

1116
00:55:48,240 --> 00:55:49,610
- He's a cop isn't he?

1117
00:55:49,610 --> 00:55:50,750
He knows the risks.

1118
00:55:50,750 --> 00:55:51,750
Besides, you told me yourself.

1119
00:55:51,750 --> 00:55:53,910
He likes to play it right to the edge.

1120
00:55:53,910 --> 00:55:55,280
- Yeah, but this time he's gone over

1121
00:55:55,280 --> 00:55:56,570
and I'm the one who's gotta get him out.

1122
00:55:56,570 --> 00:55:58,283
- Fine, but not yet.

1123
00:56:00,830 --> 00:56:03,440
- They say Gallo's got
a lion in a basement

1124
00:56:03,440 --> 00:56:04,947
over on President Street.

1125
00:56:09,670 --> 00:56:11,723
- A lion? You're joking.

1126
00:56:12,640 --> 00:56:14,290
A lion, lion?

1127
00:56:14,290 --> 00:56:15,630
- I'm serious.

1128
00:56:15,630 --> 00:56:16,820
Two of Colombo's guys,

1129
00:56:16,820 --> 00:56:19,440
Danny Otto and Phil Toria went missing.

1130
00:56:19,440 --> 00:56:21,373
The rumor is that they
got a one way ticket

1131
00:56:21,373 --> 00:56:22,733
to the Gallo zoo.

1132
00:56:25,290 --> 00:56:27,369
- So Joey's not being a nice boy?

1133
00:56:27,369 --> 00:56:30,200
(laughing)

1134
00:56:30,200 --> 00:56:31,083
Anything else?

1135
00:56:32,470 --> 00:56:33,573
- Yeah, not good.

1136
00:56:34,550 --> 00:56:36,713
The Lucchese family got
a tip from city hall,

1137
00:56:36,713 --> 00:56:39,793
NYPD has slipped a cop
into one of the families.

1138
00:56:40,710 --> 00:56:41,603
- Which family?

1139
00:56:43,200 --> 00:56:44,033
- We don't know.

1140
00:56:45,580 --> 00:56:47,175
Yet.

1141
00:56:47,175 --> 00:56:50,003
(dramatic music)

1142
00:56:50,003 --> 00:56:50,923
- All right.

1143
00:56:52,200 --> 00:56:53,203
New business.

1144
00:56:59,475 --> 00:57:02,475
(people chattering)

1145
00:57:05,970 --> 00:57:07,300
- Your tight little
ship has sprung a leak,

1146
00:57:07,300 --> 00:57:08,567
they know about me.

1147
00:57:08,567 --> 00:57:11,030
- Relax. They don't want to squat.

1148
00:57:11,030 --> 00:57:12,083
How they gonna?

1149
00:57:12,083 --> 00:57:15,250
(door chimes ringing)

1150
00:57:19,643 --> 00:57:21,476
What?
- It's Cosentino.

1151
00:57:25,260 --> 00:57:26,093
- You know he made a mess.

1152
00:57:26,093 --> 00:57:28,598
Did you ever see him eat with chopsticks?

1153
00:57:28,598 --> 00:57:29,763
- They never eat here.

1154
00:57:30,910 --> 00:57:32,206
- Well, they're eating here now.

1155
00:57:32,206 --> 00:57:33,303
Got any ideas?

1156
00:57:36,515 --> 00:57:38,290
If they see us, you just tell
them that you're my brother.

1157
00:57:38,290 --> 00:57:40,577
- Mm-hmm. Problem.

1158
00:57:40,577 --> 00:57:42,877
I'm about to cast my lines.

1159
00:57:42,877 --> 00:57:45,460
- I mean, what are we gonna do?

1160
00:57:47,554 --> 00:57:48,721
- Here you go.

1161
00:57:54,334 --> 00:57:56,376
(Stevie clears throat)

1162
00:57:56,376 --> 00:57:57,209
- Okay.

1163
00:58:04,864 --> 00:58:08,286
(men chattering)

1164
00:58:08,286 --> 00:58:09,623
- Where'd you go?

1165
00:58:09,623 --> 00:58:10,804
- Made a phone call.

1166
00:58:10,804 --> 00:58:12,756
We've got about 60 seconds.

1167
00:58:12,756 --> 00:58:14,056
You gonna eat that shrimp?

1168
00:58:15,060 --> 00:58:17,610
Hey, did you hear Joey
Gallo got married yesterday?

1169
00:58:18,800 --> 00:58:21,737
I would pay money to hear him
say "Till death do us part."

1170
00:58:21,737 --> 00:58:23,930
- Did you check out that lion story?

1171
00:58:23,930 --> 00:58:25,340
- Mm-hmm.

1172
00:58:25,340 --> 00:58:27,030
The basement on President Street.

1173
00:58:27,030 --> 00:58:29,408
- And what are you doing about it?

1174
00:58:29,408 --> 00:58:32,050
- What? Call the ASPCA?

1175
00:58:32,050 --> 00:58:33,579
From when I hear, it ain't starving.

1176
00:58:33,579 --> 00:58:35,280
(door chimes ringing)

1177
00:58:35,280 --> 00:58:36,868
- All right, people.

1178
00:58:36,868 --> 00:58:39,100
I want you to grab your belongings.

1179
00:58:39,100 --> 00:58:41,340
- I called the bomb squad.

1180
00:58:41,340 --> 00:58:42,990
First chance you get, out the back.

1181
00:58:42,990 --> 00:58:45,390
Keep your head down and
hit the streets running.

1182
00:58:47,169 --> 00:58:49,919
(sirens wailing)

1183
00:58:53,567 --> 00:58:57,067
- [Officer] Come on, let's go sir, please.

1184
00:59:00,280 --> 00:59:01,530
- Hey, Collura!

1185
00:59:02,570 --> 00:59:04,803
Wasn't that Steve Collura?

1186
00:59:04,803 --> 00:59:07,430
- I don't know. It kind
of looked like him.

1187
00:59:07,430 --> 00:59:08,330
Come on, let's go.

1188
00:59:13,345 --> 00:59:14,178
Cellini?

1189
00:59:15,928 --> 00:59:16,761
What are you doing here?

1190
00:59:16,761 --> 00:59:18,318
You working the bomb squad now?

1191
00:59:18,318 --> 00:59:20,563
- Nah, I clean up after
the mounted police.

1192
00:59:23,750 --> 00:59:25,410
So don't stay too long, eh?

1193
00:59:25,410 --> 00:59:27,010
I don't want to sweep yous away.

1194
00:59:29,040 --> 00:59:30,260
- What's he doing here?

1195
00:59:31,160 --> 00:59:32,410
- That's a good question.

1196
00:59:34,753 --> 00:59:37,253
(soft music)

1197
00:59:52,200 --> 00:59:54,254
- Maria, hey, it's me.

1198
00:59:54,254 --> 00:59:55,902
- Hi.

1199
00:59:55,902 --> 00:59:56,740
- What are you doing here?

1200
00:59:56,740 --> 00:59:57,740
It's after midnight.

1201
00:59:58,785 --> 01:00:02,060
- Um, I came by after class to wait.

1202
01:00:02,060 --> 01:00:03,323
I guess I fell asleep.

1203
01:00:04,249 --> 01:00:06,180
I thought you'd be home earlier.

1204
01:00:06,180 --> 01:00:08,659
- Yeah, me too.

1205
01:00:08,659 --> 01:00:10,298
Work.

1206
01:00:10,298 --> 01:00:11,131
- Oh.

1207
01:00:12,557 --> 01:00:14,523
- What's the matter?

1208
01:00:14,523 --> 01:00:16,288
- I just remembered a dream I had.

1209
01:00:16,288 --> 01:00:17,371
- Yeah, what?

1210
01:00:22,658 --> 01:00:24,158
Maria, what is it?

1211
01:00:27,462 --> 01:00:29,737
- You haven't change your mind, have you?

1212
01:00:29,737 --> 01:00:33,390
About the family business and
all the things we discussed.

1213
01:00:33,390 --> 01:00:34,223
- No.

1214
01:00:37,185 --> 01:00:38,753
I'll speak to Don Carlo this Sunday

1215
01:00:38,753 --> 01:00:40,882
when we go to the house for dinner.

1216
01:00:40,882 --> 01:00:41,715
- Good.

1217
01:00:45,417 --> 01:00:46,267
- Was your dream?

1218
01:00:49,933 --> 01:00:54,933
- It's gone.

1219
01:01:05,360 --> 01:01:06,610
- No, not you Marty, him.

1220
01:01:25,756 --> 01:01:27,863
- Where to, Mr. Castellano?

1221
01:01:27,863 --> 01:01:29,067
- Just move.

1222
01:01:29,067 --> 01:01:31,456
(engine starts)

1223
01:01:31,456 --> 01:01:35,128
(suspenseful music)

1224
01:01:35,128 --> 01:01:38,130
Let's you and me just
take a little ride, okay?

1225
01:01:38,130 --> 01:01:40,417
Hester Street.
- Yeah, you got it.

1226
01:01:43,760 --> 01:01:46,077
- You live in the village, don't you?

1227
01:01:46,077 --> 01:01:47,840
What, you hang out with these hippies,

1228
01:01:47,840 --> 01:01:49,100
these flower children?

1229
01:01:49,100 --> 01:01:50,550
- I don't hang out with them.

1230
01:01:51,680 --> 01:01:53,054
- Who do you hang out with?

1231
01:01:53,054 --> 01:01:55,804
(dramatic music)

1232
01:01:59,960 --> 01:02:00,793
Take a left.

1233
01:02:02,360 --> 01:02:03,313
Pull over and stop.

1234
01:02:08,209 --> 01:02:10,866
(dramatic music)

1235
01:02:10,866 --> 01:02:13,190
You hang out with Joey Gallo?

1236
01:02:13,190 --> 01:02:14,490
He lives in a village too.

1237
01:02:16,190 --> 01:02:17,797
- No, I never even met him.

1238
01:02:18,800 --> 01:02:19,870
- He's a crazy bastard.

1239
01:02:19,870 --> 01:02:23,120
Threatening war with the Colombo's,

1240
01:02:23,120 --> 01:02:24,970
whacking out guys without permission.

1241
01:02:26,880 --> 01:02:29,120
We don't do that sort of thing anymore.

1242
01:02:30,867 --> 01:02:34,213
And after tomorrow,
neither will Joey Gallo.

1243
01:02:49,513 --> 01:02:50,430
- Hi.
- Hey.

1244
01:02:53,936 --> 01:02:55,662
- Still going to the movies?

1245
01:02:55,662 --> 01:02:57,653
- Nope. I got to work tonight.

1246
01:02:59,920 --> 01:03:00,970
- Is everything okay?

1247
01:03:01,950 --> 01:03:03,611
- Yeah.

1248
01:03:03,611 --> 01:03:06,753
I want to take a picture of the two of us.

1249
01:03:08,220 --> 01:03:10,030
- Right now?
- Yeah.

1250
01:03:10,030 --> 01:03:12,150
- I'm a mess. I've been in school all day.

1251
01:03:12,150 --> 01:03:13,600
Can we do it this weekend?

1252
01:03:13,600 --> 01:03:14,880
- No.

1253
01:03:14,880 --> 01:03:15,713
- Why not?

1254
01:03:16,780 --> 01:03:17,613
- 'Cause, uh,

1255
01:03:20,040 --> 01:03:21,860
I need instant gratification.

1256
01:03:21,860 --> 01:03:23,060
- Oh yeah?

1257
01:03:23,060 --> 01:03:24,883
Good thing all you want is a picture.

1258
01:03:27,627 --> 01:03:28,796
- Come here.

1259
01:03:28,796 --> 01:03:30,080
- You know, you're
usually not this strange.

1260
01:03:30,080 --> 01:03:31,130
Strange? What's strange?

1261
01:03:31,130 --> 01:03:31,963
I was looking through all the
pictures that I've got of you

1262
01:03:31,963 --> 01:03:34,220
and there wasn't one of us together.

1263
01:03:34,220 --> 01:03:35,773
- You were looking
through all my pictures?

1264
01:03:35,773 --> 01:03:37,563
- Yeah.
- That's very sweet.

1265
01:03:37,563 --> 01:03:38,761
Or did forget what I look like?

1266
01:03:38,761 --> 01:03:40,708
- No, I didn't forget what you look like.

1267
01:03:40,708 --> 01:03:45,708
Now you won't either.

1268
01:03:52,290 --> 01:03:53,753
- Joey Gallo. You sure?

1269
01:03:55,830 --> 01:03:57,303
- Yeah. I'm sure.

1270
01:03:58,450 --> 01:03:59,450
It's tomorrow night.

1271
01:04:00,610 --> 01:04:01,443
- Where?

1272
01:04:01,443 --> 01:04:02,420
- Umbertos Clam House.

1273
01:04:02,420 --> 01:04:04,662
There's two cars, I'm driving back up.

1274
01:04:04,662 --> 01:04:05,495
- Congratulations.

1275
01:04:05,495 --> 01:04:07,523
- Hey, my ass is on the line here.

1276
01:04:07,523 --> 01:04:09,693
What do I do?

1277
01:04:09,693 --> 01:04:10,843
- I'll get back to you.

1278
01:04:12,030 --> 01:04:13,980
- It's tomorrow night.

1279
01:04:13,980 --> 01:04:14,920
- I said I'll get back to you.

1280
01:04:14,920 --> 01:04:17,240
I'll get back. Would you calm down?

1281
01:04:17,240 --> 01:04:19,290
All right, five minutes then you leave.

1282
01:04:19,290 --> 01:04:21,153
Yo, Stevie, want some fries?

1283
01:04:25,797 --> 01:04:27,242
Okay.

1284
01:04:27,242 --> 01:04:30,242
(suspenseful music)

1285
01:04:38,396 --> 01:04:41,082
(dramatic music)

1286
01:04:41,082 --> 01:04:41,915
- Come on.

1287
01:04:45,250 --> 01:04:46,400
- Relax, he'll be here.

1288
01:04:48,248 --> 01:04:50,998
(sirens wailing)

1289
01:05:01,990 --> 01:05:02,823
- Heads up.

1290
01:05:26,323 --> 01:05:27,740
- [Man] Let's go.

1291
01:05:31,847 --> 01:05:33,000
- Yeah, I'm sorry.

1292
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:34,823
I hope you guys haven't been waiting long.

1293
01:05:36,885 --> 01:05:38,052
- Take a left.

1294
01:05:40,090 --> 01:05:43,007
(tires screeching)

1295
01:05:45,900 --> 01:05:47,350
Next light make another left.

1296
01:05:55,430 --> 01:05:56,913
Pull into this alley up here.

1297
01:06:04,340 --> 01:06:05,173
Slow down.

1298
01:06:06,920 --> 01:06:07,893
Okay. Stop here.

1299
01:06:16,760 --> 01:06:19,260
Keep the engine running,
but turn your lights off.

1300
01:06:24,599 --> 01:06:27,682
(suspenseful music)

1301
01:07:06,487 --> 01:07:08,154
All right, let's go.

1302
01:07:12,676 --> 01:07:15,593
(tires screeching)

1303
01:07:19,140 --> 01:07:21,223
You're good with garbage.

1304
01:07:36,132 --> 01:07:37,932
So how long been working with Danny?

1305
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:40,660
- Eight or nine months.

1306
01:07:40,660 --> 01:07:41,493
- And they put you on this job?

1307
01:07:41,493 --> 01:07:43,747
You've come a long way,
eight or nine months.

1308
01:07:43,747 --> 01:07:45,063
You must be connected.

1309
01:07:50,058 --> 01:07:51,723
- What you looking for?

1310
01:07:51,723 --> 01:07:53,560
- He's nervous.

1311
01:07:53,560 --> 01:07:54,410
First hit, right?

1312
01:07:56,330 --> 01:07:57,163
- So?

1313
01:07:58,260 --> 01:07:59,677
- What a way to make your bones,

1314
01:07:59,677 --> 01:08:01,733
whacking off Joey Gallo.

1315
01:08:10,550 --> 01:08:12,690
- When's he suppose to get here?

1316
01:08:12,690 --> 01:08:14,820
- Right after the Copa closes.

1317
01:08:14,820 --> 01:08:17,323
It's his birthday, he's having a party.

1318
01:08:18,547 --> 01:08:20,283
- Happy birthday, Joey.

1319
01:08:21,571 --> 01:08:24,321
(dramatic music)

1320
01:08:31,184 --> 01:08:33,017
It's the birthday boy.

1321
01:08:35,533 --> 01:08:37,993
One bodyguard, you're
getting careless, Joey.

1322
01:08:44,643 --> 01:08:45,660
- Hey, relax kid.

1323
01:08:45,660 --> 01:08:46,713
We're just back up.

1324
01:08:51,597 --> 01:08:53,350
If we have to go in I'll
take Joey and the kid,

1325
01:08:53,350 --> 01:08:55,340
you take the bodyguard and the birds.

1326
01:08:57,609 --> 01:08:58,798
- What?

1327
01:08:58,798 --> 01:09:00,190
- You're gonna hit the kid?

1328
01:09:00,190 --> 01:09:01,023
- What's the matter?

1329
01:09:01,023 --> 01:09:02,210
She remind you of your sister?

1330
01:09:03,483 --> 01:09:05,200
- It's just business, kid.

1331
01:09:05,200 --> 01:09:06,323
Nothing personal.

1332
01:09:08,366 --> 01:09:11,209
(suspenseful music)

1333
01:09:11,209 --> 01:09:13,235
- I gotta take a leak.
- What?

1334
01:09:13,235 --> 01:09:15,103
- I got a weak bladder.

1335
01:09:16,990 --> 01:09:17,823
- Make it fast.

1336
01:09:37,156 --> 01:09:39,573
(coin falls)

1337
01:09:45,530 --> 01:09:46,830
- I don't like it.
- Hmm.

1338
01:09:48,570 --> 01:09:49,970
- Code yellow, identity.

1339
01:09:49,970 --> 01:09:51,310
- Zero two zero, I need Amber.

1340
01:09:51,310 --> 01:09:52,333
- [Operator] Not here,
you want the message desk?

1341
01:09:52,333 --> 01:09:54,130
- No, no, no, I need Amber.

1342
01:09:54,130 --> 01:09:55,540
Where is he? He's supposed to be here.

1343
01:09:55,540 --> 01:09:56,373
Where's my backup?

1344
01:09:56,373 --> 01:09:57,206
I'm here all by myself.

1345
01:09:57,206 --> 01:09:58,163
- Hold on. I'll try and find him.

1346
01:09:58,163 --> 01:10:00,515
- I can't hold on, you're
supposed to be here.

1347
01:10:00,515 --> 01:10:01,730
Where is everybody?

1348
01:10:01,730 --> 01:10:04,310
This thing's going down any minute now.

1349
01:10:04,310 --> 01:10:05,783
- Hold on.

1350
01:10:07,235 --> 01:10:08,857
- I don't like it, go get him.

1351
01:10:17,640 --> 01:10:19,330
- Zero two zero.
- Yeah, yeah.

1352
01:10:19,330 --> 01:10:21,066
- I can't locate Amber.

1353
01:10:21,066 --> 01:10:22,563
I'll give him your message.

1354
01:10:30,811 --> 01:10:31,753
- Come on.

1355
01:10:33,001 --> 01:10:35,584
Come on, come on, let's go, eh?

1356
01:10:51,961 --> 01:10:54,378
- Next time, piss your pants.

1357
01:10:55,450 --> 01:10:58,450
(suspenseful music)

1358
01:11:07,420 --> 01:11:08,628
Start the car, kid.

1359
01:11:08,628 --> 01:11:11,188
(suspenseful music)

1360
01:11:11,188 --> 01:11:13,855
(engine starts)

1361
01:11:33,008 --> 01:11:34,491
What you looking for?

1362
01:11:34,491 --> 01:11:36,052
You know something we don't?
- Huh?

1363
01:11:36,052 --> 01:11:38,469
(gun firing)

1364
01:11:45,071 --> 01:11:48,166
(gun firing)

1365
01:11:48,166 --> 01:11:49,916
Move it kid, move it!

1366
01:11:53,354 --> 01:11:55,687
(gun fires)

1367
01:11:58,696 --> 01:11:59,943
Come on, kid!

1368
01:11:59,943 --> 01:12:01,443
Get going, come on!

1369
01:12:02,685 --> 01:12:05,520
(girl screaming)

1370
01:12:05,520 --> 01:12:07,231
- Move it, hit it!

1371
01:12:07,231 --> 01:12:10,726
(tires screeching)

1372
01:12:10,726 --> 01:12:13,143
(gun firing)

1373
01:12:20,437 --> 01:12:23,187
(sirens wailing)

1374
01:12:37,624 --> 01:12:38,470
It's Joey Gallo.

1375
01:12:38,470 --> 01:12:40,953
Bodyguard was also hit and he's
on the way to the hospital.

1376
01:12:40,953 --> 01:12:42,644
- Anybody else?
- No, nobody else.

1377
01:12:42,644 --> 01:12:43,644
- All right.

1378
01:12:47,664 --> 01:12:48,790
Anything?

1379
01:12:48,790 --> 01:12:50,143
- Not since the panic call.

1380
01:12:51,530 --> 01:12:53,127
You want me to make some fresh?

1381
01:12:53,127 --> 01:12:54,850
- Please.

1382
01:12:54,850 --> 01:12:56,200
It's gonna be a long night.

1383
01:13:03,538 --> 01:13:05,205
- Morning.
- Morning.

1384
01:13:06,120 --> 01:13:08,320
- Uncle Paul, is Poppy up yet?

1385
01:13:08,320 --> 01:13:09,410
- No, Don's still asleep.

1386
01:13:09,410 --> 01:13:10,510
We're waiting for him.

1387
01:13:12,110 --> 01:13:13,350
- Uncle Paul, do you know where Steve is?

1388
01:13:13,350 --> 01:13:15,314
He was supposed to call me this morning.

1389
01:13:15,314 --> 01:13:17,057
- No, no, I don't, I
don't know where he is.

1390
01:13:17,057 --> 01:13:19,620
- You know how it is, a guy
gets tied up in the job.

1391
01:13:19,620 --> 01:13:20,970
Don't worry, he'll show up.

1392
01:13:25,597 --> 01:13:29,098
(dramatic music)

1393
01:13:29,098 --> 01:13:31,115
- It's terrible, terrible.

1394
01:13:31,115 --> 01:13:32,533
I, for one, am shocked.

1395
01:13:34,417 --> 01:13:37,183
- He's dead.
- We don't know that.

1396
01:13:39,650 --> 01:13:41,410
- It's been over four hours.

1397
01:13:41,410 --> 01:13:43,883
- He'll call, I'm sure he will.

1398
01:13:49,350 --> 01:13:50,183
- He's dead.

1399
01:14:09,512 --> 01:14:13,003
(dramatic music)

1400
01:14:13,003 --> 01:14:15,586
- How 'bout the East River?

1401
01:14:15,586 --> 01:14:18,169
(somber music)

1402
01:14:19,189 --> 01:14:20,022
- How did this happen?

1403
01:14:20,022 --> 01:14:21,493
And how am I gonna tell Maria?

1404
01:14:25,870 --> 01:14:28,207
- We're not sure, Don
Carlo, but it looks bad.

1405
01:14:28,207 --> 01:14:29,520
- You can't find him.

1406
01:14:29,520 --> 01:14:31,110
- He dropped the button
men off in Brooklyn

1407
01:14:31,110 --> 01:14:33,523
and took off.
- All right, you find him.

1408
01:14:34,490 --> 01:14:36,670
No harm is to come to him until I'm sure.

1409
01:14:36,670 --> 01:14:40,757
You understand?
- Si, Don Carlo, I understand.

1410
01:14:43,203 --> 01:14:45,450
- Dom, we've been at this for 48 hours.

1411
01:14:45,450 --> 01:14:47,023
Nothing, nadda, zilch.

1412
01:14:48,750 --> 01:14:50,530
Look, if he's been whacked,

1413
01:14:50,530 --> 01:14:51,749
maybe it ain't Gambino.

1414
01:14:51,749 --> 01:14:54,250
What if some of Gallo's
boys saw him at the hit?

1415
01:14:54,250 --> 01:14:55,083
- Right.

1416
01:14:55,083 --> 01:14:56,500
Larry, get your butt over to Gallo's place

1417
01:14:56,500 --> 01:14:58,160
on President Street, code three.

1418
01:14:58,160 --> 01:14:59,809
Find out if that lions been fed lately.

1419
01:14:59,809 --> 01:15:02,040
All right, the rest of
you, gloves are off.

1420
01:15:02,040 --> 01:15:03,320
Stop Foley and the wise guys.

1421
01:15:03,320 --> 01:15:04,970
Somebody's got to know something.

1422
01:15:05,831 --> 01:15:08,420
(suspenseful music)

1423
01:15:08,420 --> 01:15:10,247
- Where's Maria, is she coming?

1424
01:15:10,247 --> 01:15:11,080
- No.

1425
01:15:18,137 --> 01:15:19,880
- I sent Raggio over to Charles Street,

1426
01:15:19,880 --> 01:15:21,110
to the kid's apartment.

1427
01:15:21,110 --> 01:15:22,720
The place is swarming with cops.

1428
01:15:22,720 --> 01:15:24,650
- That's proves nothing.

1429
01:15:24,650 --> 01:15:27,660
- Don Carlo, the cops are
turning the town inside out.

1430
01:15:27,660 --> 01:15:29,150
They're dragging our guys off the street.

1431
01:15:29,150 --> 01:15:30,220
You know, as well as me,

1432
01:15:30,220 --> 01:15:32,390
they only look this hard
for one of their own.

1433
01:15:32,390 --> 01:15:34,786
- I ain't saying nothing
until I see my lawyer.

1434
01:15:34,786 --> 01:15:36,950
(suspenseful music)

1435
01:15:36,950 --> 01:15:38,540
- Jack, Larry, will you excuse us?

1436
01:15:38,540 --> 01:15:40,840
Mr Raggio and me are
gonna have a little chat.

1437
01:15:41,999 --> 01:15:44,151
Paulie. (speaking Italian)

1438
01:15:44,151 --> 01:15:44,984
How you doing?

1439
01:15:44,984 --> 01:15:46,510
- I ain't doing nothing

1440
01:15:46,510 --> 01:15:50,135
and I ain't saying nothing
until I see my lawyer.

1441
01:15:50,135 --> 01:15:52,700
- Good idea.

1442
01:15:52,700 --> 01:15:54,273
You can have him draw up your will.

1443
01:15:55,700 --> 01:15:58,177
He' alive.
- Just a sec.

1444
01:15:59,080 --> 01:15:59,913
How do you know?

1445
01:15:59,913 --> 01:16:02,310
- Gambino's looking for
him just as hard as we are.

1446
01:16:02,310 --> 01:16:03,490
- Well then why doesn't he come in

1447
01:16:03,490 --> 01:16:05,406
and let us protect him?

1448
01:16:05,406 --> 01:16:07,840
- Is that a serious question, Inspector?

1449
01:16:07,840 --> 01:16:09,250
I got a man out there somewhere

1450
01:16:09,250 --> 01:16:10,510
who's alone and terrified.

1451
01:16:10,510 --> 01:16:13,030
He doesn't know what side he's on anymore.

1452
01:16:13,030 --> 01:16:14,270
Why?

1453
01:16:14,270 --> 01:16:16,120
Because he's thinking we screwed him.

1454
01:16:16,120 --> 01:16:16,953
That's why.

1455
01:16:18,090 --> 01:16:19,340
I told them I'd be there.

1456
01:16:22,160 --> 01:16:24,307
- [Inspector] Couldn't
be avoided, Cellini.

1457
01:16:24,307 --> 01:16:25,720
(Dom sighs)

1458
01:16:25,720 --> 01:16:28,118
- Where the hell are you?

1459
01:16:28,118 --> 01:16:30,785
(phone ringing)

1460
01:16:31,718 --> 01:16:32,551
- Hello?

1461
01:16:34,350 --> 01:16:35,183
Hello?

1462
01:16:37,130 --> 01:16:37,963
Steve.

1463
01:16:39,100 --> 01:16:40,250
I know who you are now.

1464
01:16:41,267 --> 01:16:42,217
Who you really are.

1465
01:16:44,340 --> 01:16:46,150
Except I don't really know who you are.

1466
01:16:46,150 --> 01:16:48,443
Why you did this to me.

1467
01:16:50,085 --> 01:16:53,085
You loved me, so I don't understand.

1468
01:16:55,161 --> 01:16:56,227
Damn you!

1469
01:16:57,767 --> 01:17:01,934
I was ready to spend the
rest of my life with you.

1470
01:17:05,841 --> 01:17:07,424
I'm hanging up now.

1471
01:17:08,391 --> 01:17:10,974
(somber music)

1472
01:17:37,401 --> 01:17:40,151
(engine humming)

1473
01:18:02,277 --> 01:18:05,110
(dramatic music)

1474
01:18:06,560 --> 01:18:07,393
- We got him.

1475
01:18:07,393 --> 01:18:09,443
Location six, 1700 hours, come alone.

1476
01:18:10,646 --> 01:18:12,296
- Wouldn't have it any other way.

1477
01:18:13,660 --> 01:18:15,063
- Yeah, I'm still alive.

1478
01:18:16,210 --> 01:18:17,900
Also accessory to murder one.

1479
01:18:17,900 --> 01:18:19,930
- No way, you're on the job.

1480
01:18:19,930 --> 01:18:20,978
Nobody's gonna file charges.

1481
01:18:20,978 --> 01:18:22,700
- Says who?
- Me.

1482
01:18:22,700 --> 01:18:24,830
- You, huh?

1483
01:18:24,830 --> 01:18:26,820
Guy who says everything was under control.

1484
01:18:26,820 --> 01:18:27,720
We don't leave our people hanging.

1485
01:18:27,720 --> 01:18:30,290
No, you just throw their
lives out with the trash.

1486
01:18:30,290 --> 01:18:32,060
- Life, Stevie, that's not your life.

1487
01:18:32,060 --> 01:18:33,870
They're the bad guys, remember?

1488
01:18:33,870 --> 01:18:35,510
You're a cop.

1489
01:18:35,510 --> 01:18:37,650
Nobody even figured they'd
use you in the Gallo hit.

1490
01:18:37,650 --> 01:18:39,430
Sometimes even we get lucky.

1491
01:18:39,430 --> 01:18:41,290
They're calling a grand
jury on Don Gambino.

1492
01:18:41,290 --> 01:18:43,073
- So I'm you're start witness?

1493
01:18:44,307 --> 01:18:45,974
- What do you think?

1494
01:18:48,930 --> 01:18:49,763
- That's it?

1495
01:18:51,200 --> 01:18:52,942
That's why you didn't show up?

1496
01:18:52,942 --> 01:18:55,393
You wanted Gallo wasted, then
I testify against Gambino

1497
01:18:55,393 --> 01:18:57,620
and you get 'em both?

1498
01:18:57,620 --> 01:18:58,487
- Don't even think that.

1499
01:18:58,487 --> 01:19:00,820
And for God sakes don't ever say it.

1500
01:19:00,820 --> 01:19:04,000
They'll chew you up and spit
you out in a million pieces.

1501
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:05,920
Stevie, you go near her
now, you're a dead man.

1502
01:19:05,920 --> 01:19:07,600
- Yeah, well maybe I deserve
that, the things I've done.

1503
01:19:07,600 --> 01:19:10,180
- After you testify, I'm putting
you in witness protection.

1504
01:19:10,180 --> 01:19:11,275
- No, you're not.

1505
01:19:11,275 --> 01:19:12,320
I aint gonna spend the rest of my life

1506
01:19:12,320 --> 01:19:13,970
in Doorknob, Wisconsin.

1507
01:19:13,970 --> 01:19:14,803
- What life?

1508
01:19:14,803 --> 01:19:17,130
You go it alone, you think
Gambino won't track you down?

1509
01:19:17,130 --> 01:19:19,006
- At least he never lied me.

1510
01:19:19,006 --> 01:19:21,135
And he never sold me out.

1511
01:19:21,135 --> 01:19:24,150
- You think that's what I did? Huh?

1512
01:19:25,400 --> 01:19:26,840
- See you around.

1513
01:19:26,840 --> 01:19:29,363
- Hey, you're still a cop.

1514
01:19:29,363 --> 01:19:31,120
There's gonna be a grand jury

1515
01:19:31,120 --> 01:19:32,340
and you have to appear.

1516
01:19:32,340 --> 01:19:33,250
- Fine.

1517
01:19:33,250 --> 01:19:35,264
Till then, don't try to find me.

1518
01:19:35,264 --> 01:19:38,014
(dramatic music)

1519
01:19:43,801 --> 01:19:46,718
(tires screeching)

1520
01:20:10,080 --> 01:20:11,041
- That's a good idea.

1521
01:20:11,041 --> 01:20:13,458
(indistinct)

1522
01:20:14,806 --> 01:20:16,280
There were two cars carrying the hitmen,

1523
01:20:16,280 --> 01:20:17,780
I drove the second car.

1524
01:20:17,780 --> 01:20:20,230
- But you took no active
part in the shooting?

1525
01:20:20,230 --> 01:20:21,460
- No, sir.

1526
01:20:21,460 --> 01:20:23,760
- What exactly did you
see, Detective Collura?

1527
01:20:24,648 --> 01:20:26,360
- The first shots were
fired inside the restaurant

1528
01:20:26,360 --> 01:20:27,543
so I only heard those.

1529
01:20:28,880 --> 01:20:30,940
I saw Joey Gallo stumble
out into the street,

1530
01:20:30,940 --> 01:20:34,660
the hitman followed him out,
shot him again, killed him.

1531
01:20:34,660 --> 01:20:36,250
- And this murder was carried out

1532
01:20:36,250 --> 01:20:38,793
by the Gambino crime family, correct?

1533
01:20:43,560 --> 01:20:44,393
- I don't know.

1534
01:20:45,270 --> 01:20:46,373
- You don't know?

1535
01:20:47,530 --> 01:20:49,070
- I'd never seen any of the hitmen before

1536
01:20:49,070 --> 01:20:51,570
so I don't know if they
were a member of a family.

1537
01:20:52,800 --> 01:20:53,850
- Ah.

1538
01:20:53,850 --> 01:20:56,090
But the orders came from Carlo Gambino,

1539
01:20:56,090 --> 01:20:57,520
isn't that correct?

1540
01:20:57,520 --> 01:20:58,870
- I don't know that either.

1541
01:21:03,260 --> 01:21:06,510
- Carlo Gambino didn't ask you
to drive the car that night?

1542
01:21:06,510 --> 01:21:07,810
- No, sir.

1543
01:21:07,810 --> 01:21:10,630
- He never told you that Joey
Gallo was to be murdered?

1544
01:21:10,630 --> 01:21:11,463
- No, sir.

1545
01:21:15,690 --> 01:21:18,900
- Detective Collura, how
long did you work undercover

1546
01:21:18,900 --> 01:21:20,300
in the Gambino crime family?

1547
01:21:22,900 --> 01:21:23,950
- Since last October.

1548
01:21:25,270 --> 01:21:27,690
- And during that time
you formed a friendship

1549
01:21:27,690 --> 01:21:29,950
with Carlo Gambino, a close friendship?

1550
01:21:29,950 --> 01:21:31,250
- That was part of my job.

1551
01:21:31,250 --> 01:21:33,400
- So close, in fact, you were engaged

1552
01:21:33,400 --> 01:21:35,000
to marry his goddaughter, right?

1553
01:21:36,550 --> 01:21:37,890
- Yeah.

1554
01:21:37,890 --> 01:21:38,723
She had nothing to do with-

1555
01:21:38,723 --> 01:21:41,580
- So close, in fact, that
you might be persuaded

1556
01:21:41,580 --> 01:21:43,140
to forget certain things he said or did,

1557
01:21:43,140 --> 01:21:44,403
isn't that true?

1558
01:21:45,310 --> 01:21:46,483
- Carlo Gambino never told me

1559
01:21:46,483 --> 01:21:48,363
that Joey Gallo had to be killed.

1560
01:21:49,350 --> 01:21:51,260
He never asked me to kill him.

1561
01:21:51,260 --> 01:21:52,308
He never asked me to drive any car

1562
01:21:52,308 --> 01:21:54,358
that had anything to do with killing him.

1563
01:21:55,401 --> 01:21:56,383
That's the truth.

1564
01:21:59,190 --> 01:22:00,240
It's also true

1565
01:22:02,280 --> 01:22:04,290
that when I knew the hit had been planned,

1566
01:22:04,290 --> 01:22:06,530
I informed my superiors at OCCB

1567
01:22:06,530 --> 01:22:07,880
and they told me not to worry.

1568
01:22:07,880 --> 01:22:09,460
They told me that everything
was under control.

1569
01:22:09,460 --> 01:22:10,293
They told me that-

1570
01:22:10,293 --> 01:22:12,717
- Thank you, detective.
- That'll be all.

1571
01:22:18,318 --> 01:22:20,347
(elevator dings)

1572
01:22:20,347 --> 01:22:22,650
- How did it go?
- Oh, beautiful.

1573
01:22:22,650 --> 01:22:24,140
Your star witness gave me nothing.

1574
01:22:24,140 --> 01:22:26,040
Gambino's gonna walk.

1575
01:22:26,040 --> 01:22:27,510
Thanks, Cellini.

1576
01:22:27,510 --> 01:22:28,960
Nice doing business with you.

1577
01:22:29,986 --> 01:22:32,736
(elevator dings)

1578
01:22:45,588 --> 01:22:48,740
(solemn music)

1579
01:22:48,740 --> 01:22:50,823
- Can I help you officer?

1580
01:23:12,424 --> 01:23:15,007
(solemn music)

1581
01:23:31,082 --> 01:23:33,499
(soft music)

1582
01:24:22,949 --> 01:24:23,782
- Maria!

1583
01:24:36,128 --> 01:24:38,211
- [Child] Come on, Maria.

1584
01:24:43,775 --> 01:24:46,358
(solemn music)

1585
01:25:39,824 --> 01:25:42,241
(soft music)

1586
01:26:30,767 --> 01:26:33,434
(upbeat music)
