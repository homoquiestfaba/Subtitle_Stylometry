I'm not a pure filmmaker.

MILIUS (V.O.):
I don't sit there and say...

3
00:00:39,973 --> 00:00:43,144
"Oh, the juxtaposition of
images and color and graphics."

4
00:00:43,544 --> 00:00:45,113
MILIUS (V.O.):
I don't give a damn
about that stuff.

5
00:00:45,146 --> 00:00:49,250
So, my whole concept
of what I do...

6
00:00:49,283 --> 00:00:51,319
goes back to the old theme
of telling the story...

7
00:00:51,352 --> 00:00:57,125
of the Homeric thing
of being able to tell the tale
of the Trojan Wars...

8

again and again and passed down
until finally, you know,
it's written down by somebody.

00:01:31,825 --> 00:01:36,664
I'm John Milius,
I'm a filmmaker, an historian
and a storyteller.

17
00:01:36,864 --> 00:01:39,600
AL RUDDY (V.O.): John Milius
had more movies made...

18
00:01:39,633 --> 00:01:42,336
than any writer
in the history of Hollywood.

19
00:01:42,370 --> 00:01:46,574
He was really one of the first
guys who said, "Hey, this is
how people talk."

20
00:01:46,607 --> 00:01:48,676
Do I feel lucky?

21
00:01:48,709 --> 00:01:50,811
Well, do ya', punk?

22
00:01:50,844 --> 00:01:54,148
He doesn't write for pussies
and he doesn't write for women.

23
00:01:54,348 --> 00:01:56,650
He writes for men,
because he's a man.

24
00:01:56,684 --> 00:02:03,391
He's not one of those directors
that just goes from one movie to
the next and he's a hired gun.

25
00:02:03,424 --> 00:02:04,825
It has to be in him.

26
00:02:07,595 --> 00:02:10,664
He made the most defining
films of those decades.

27
00:02:12,933 --> 00:02:17,438
This man participated
in or directly wrote
and directed...

28
00:02:17,471 --> 00:02:20,508
these great films with these
great parts in it.

29
00:02:20,541 --> 00:02:26,414
It's pretty staggering
to... to realize the journey
he took to get there.

30
00:02:28,916 --> 00:02:34,522
What's interesting about John
is he has a personality
that is bigger than the movies.

31
00:02:34,555 --> 00:02:40,694
John is such an interesting
person, and such a great
storyteller, just in life.

32
00:02:40,728 --> 00:02:42,796
Francis couldn't tell
a story like John.

33
00:02:42,830 --> 00:02:47,167
George is a great storyteller.
He couldn't tell a story
like John. None of us.

34
00:02:48,902 --> 00:02:53,574
I mean, he's a poet from the top
of his head to the bottom
of his toes.

35
00:02:53,607 --> 00:02:55,743
He likes to blow it up,
bigger than life.

36
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:04,618
And then he's created this...
persona.

37
00:03:04,652 --> 00:03:07,388
I've heard that he referred
to himself as a Zen anarchist.

of Wild Bill character...

I hear Milius pulled
a gun on some executive.

40
00:03:18,432 --> 00:03:20,601
I like John, because
he says what he thinks...

41
00:03:20,634 --> 00:03:24,572
although I sometimes worry
that he doesn't think.

RANDAL KLEISER (V.O.):
He's the Teddy bear
with an AK-47.

into a legend.

MILIUS (V.O.): I grew up
in St. Louis, Missouri.

47
00:04:07,715 --> 00:04:11,952
It was a nice, Midwestern
kind of life, you know?

48
00:04:12,353 --> 00:04:16,457
Everything was normal, you know,
it snowed in the winter.

49
00:04:16,490 --> 00:04:20,828
MILIUS (V.O.):
My family was okay,
they were pretty dysfunctional.

50
00:04:20,861 --> 00:04:24,865
MILIUS (V.O.):
All three children usually were
trying to kill each other.

51
00:04:25,799 --> 00:04:27,668
My dad's father,
my grandfather.

52
00:04:27,701 --> 00:04:30,638
had a shoe company
called Milius Shoe Company.

53
00:04:30,671 --> 00:04:34,875
And he had basically retired
when my dad was young.

54
00:04:34,908 --> 00:04:40,381
MILIUS (V.O.):
My father was quite a bit old,
he was 58 when he sired me.

55
00:04:40,414 --> 00:04:44,918
So I really came from more
of a different generation.

56
00:04:44,952 --> 00:04:47,555
My heroes,
when I was a little kid...

57
00:04:47,588 --> 00:04:51,759
were the incomparable
Gene Autry, Roy Rogers.

58
00:04:51,792 --> 00:04:54,395
John Wayne was an equal
influence.

59
00:04:54,428 --> 00:04:57,565
Oddly enough, Chuck Yeager...

60
00:04:57,598 --> 00:05:02,002
because he broke the sound
barrier and he was the greatest
test pilot.

61
00:05:02,436 --> 00:05:06,507
We'd stayed in St. Louis,
you know, until I was seven.

62
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:08,709
We'd moved to California.

64
00:05:14,448 --> 00:05:17,385
AMANDA MILIUS (V.O.):
It was right around the
Bel-Air Country Club.

65
00:05:17,418 --> 00:05:18,586
My dad was becoming,
you know...

66
00:05:18,619 --> 00:05:20,821
a teenager
and he really rebelled.

67
00:05:20,854 --> 00:05:23,857
I think he didn't like that
kind of country club sort
of society.

68
00:05:25,726 --> 00:05:27,795
And I don't think it likes him.

69
00:05:44,144 --> 00:05:49,383
There's something about his
personality that is sort
of oppositional.

70
00:05:49,417 --> 00:05:52,720
If the counter-culture was going
left, he was gonna go right...

71
00:05:52,753 --> 00:05:54,955
to be the opposite of the
counter-culture.

72
00:05:54,988 --> 00:05:58,492
He was trying to be as
controversial in a way as
possible.

73
00:05:58,526 --> 00:06:02,563
So for everything he did, he was
going to push off in a different
direction.

74
00:06:02,596 --> 00:06:07,835
You know, the day would come
when I'd been in school long
enough and I'd be, you know...

75
00:06:07,868 --> 00:06:12,172
drafted or enlist and go to
Vietnam and probably never
come back.

76
00:06:12,205 --> 00:06:15,643
Matter of fact, I didn't
plan on coming back.

77
00:06:15,876 --> 00:06:18,479
MILIUS (V.O.):
I was gonna be a Naval
aviator...

78
00:06:18,512 --> 00:06:26,920
and I planned that I probably
wouldn't live past 26, because
I didn't see any point in it.

79
00:06:55,483 --> 00:06:59,953
You know, he came from a
generation that had an
education...

80
00:06:59,987 --> 00:07:02,823
that espoused learning
about the Classics.

81
00:07:02,856 --> 00:07:05,526
It was his way of living through
those characters...

82
00:07:05,559 --> 00:07:11,865
that he was exercising that sort
of deep-seeded issue within
himself...

83
00:07:11,899 --> 00:07:17,471
to be that guy who goes into the
military and sacrifices his
life...

84
00:07:17,505 --> 00:07:19,006
or is willing to sacrifice
his life.

85
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:21,008
He couldn't do those things.

86
00:07:21,041 --> 00:07:23,677
Then he had this moment...

87
00:07:23,711 --> 00:07:30,250
where he was kind of aware
of his lack of importance
in the world...

88
00:07:30,283 --> 00:07:33,120
and that he hadn't done
anything of meaning.

89
00:07:33,153 --> 00:07:39,092
And I wandered into a theater,
and they were playing a week
of Kurosawa films.

90
00:07:39,126 --> 00:07:42,129
MILIUS (V.O.):
I saw just about everything
he made.

91
00:07:42,162 --> 00:07:45,999
It never occurred to me
what a director was.

92
00:07:46,033 --> 00:07:48,068
And after seeing those
Kurosawa films...

93
00:07:48,101 --> 00:07:53,874
I realized that the idea
of making films or writing
films or something like that...

94
00:07:53,907 --> 00:07:56,744
and though I wanted
a military career...

95
00:07:56,777 --> 00:08:01,014
I never was able to have
a military career,
because I had asthma.

96
00:08:01,048 --> 00:08:06,219
Um, you know, being a director
is about the next best thing.

97
00:08:06,253 --> 00:08:14,762
MILIUS (V.O.):
And I ended up at USC. SC is
the West Point of Hollywood.

98
00:08:15,228 --> 00:08:20,000
I think at that time there were
only three film schools in the
United States.

99

WALTER MURCH (V.O.):
It's hard to imagine
that today...

100
00:08:22,302 --> 00:08:27,708
but it was NYU in New York,
USC and UCLA.

101
00:08:27,741 --> 00:08:30,711
BRYAN SINGER (V.O.): What USC
is now is very different than
what it was then.

102
00:08:30,744 --> 00:08:32,479
They were working out
of these small shacks...

103
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:37,284
MILIUS (V.O.): Which had been
converted into classrooms
and a production stage.

104
00:08:37,317 --> 00:08:40,621
Now it's harder to get into the
film school than med school.

105
00:08:40,654 --> 00:08:44,792
There's thousands and thousands
of students trying to be
directors today.

106
00:08:44,825 --> 00:08:47,728
Back then, there was just
a handful of us.

107
00:08:47,761 --> 00:08:51,264
Sort of the pack at USC,
there was a group of us.

108
00:08:51,298 --> 00:08:56,036
I don't know, probably a dozen
or so who really loved movies.

109
00:08:56,069 --> 00:09:01,074
Really were aggressive and were
very consumed by making
movies...

110
00:09:01,108 --> 00:09:03,076
and we were part of that group.

111
00:09:03,110 --> 00:09:05,545
( MUSIC PLAYING )

112
00:09:13,053 --> 00:09:18,158
Now, John, on the other hand,
was this big, burly guy that was
a complete Californian...

113
00:09:18,191 --> 00:09:21,161
who was a big surfer...

114
00:09:21,194 --> 00:09:26,834
and just had this huge, sort
of dominant physical presence.

115
00:09:26,867 --> 00:09:28,636
I met John in the dark.

116
00:09:28,669 --> 00:09:33,641
It was at a screening of some
student films from the previous
year.

117
00:09:33,674 --> 00:09:40,047
After one film, this voice
from the back, which I came
to recognize as John's voice...

118
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:42,082
said, "This film doesn't
have enough moxie!"

119
00:09:43,984 --> 00:09:46,887
I remember John came in once,
I'll never forget.

120
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:48,555
He's probably forgotten this.

121
00:09:48,588 --> 00:09:53,761
He came in, he had a huge
sombrero on, and he came in
looking like a Mexican bandito.

122
00:09:53,794 --> 00:09:56,964
And he was a very intimidating
figure like that.

123
00:09:56,997 --> 00:10:01,001
You gotta remember this was
college in the 60's...

124
00:10:01,034 --> 00:10:03,671
and John's point of view was
considerably different...

125
00:10:03,704 --> 00:10:05,973
than most people's point of view
at the school there.

126
00:10:06,006 --> 00:10:08,742
ANNOUNCER (V.O.):
Draft card burnings became
common...

127
00:10:08,776 --> 00:10:14,014
and the chant of "Hell no, we
won't go!" was the theme of the
protest generation.

128
00:10:14,047 --> 00:10:19,386
Hippies used to wear buttons
that said "Nirvana Now"...

129
00:10:19,419 --> 00:10:21,421
and they had a piece sign
on them.

130
00:10:21,454 --> 00:10:24,391
And it was like Nirvana Now,
you know?

131
00:10:24,424 --> 00:10:27,761
And so I took one of those
buttons and modified it...

132
00:10:27,795 --> 00:10:34,134
so that the peace sign looked
like a B-52... and put
Apocalypse Now.

133
00:10:34,167 --> 00:10:39,773
And then I put one with just a
mushroom cloud, you know, let's
get it over with!

134
00:10:42,409 --> 00:10:47,781
Talking once and he said,
"You know, I'm really a hippie.

135
00:10:47,815 --> 00:10:50,417
People think that I'm
right-wing, but I'm really
a hippie.

136
00:10:50,450 --> 00:10:55,155
It's just that the hippies
wouldn't elect me king
and I want to be king."

137
00:10:55,188 --> 00:11:00,460
There's a story that I believe
to be true...

138
00:11:00,493 --> 00:11:04,064
because I was there, that I've
heard has been denied.

139
00:11:04,097 --> 00:11:08,301
When I did my five-week
project...

140
00:11:08,335 --> 00:11:13,273
we did a wide-screen color movie
with lots of extras and things.

141
00:11:13,306 --> 00:11:18,445
Come to the Five-Week screening,
they wouldn't show it.

142
00:11:18,478 --> 00:11:19,947
It was all finished
and everything.

143
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:22,449
And the instructor said...

144
00:11:22,482 --> 00:11:25,318
"Well, we don't want to show it,
because none of the other
students are finished...

145
00:11:25,352 --> 00:11:28,388
and this would be an
embarrassment to them."

146
00:11:28,421 --> 00:11:31,792
So, John got really mad at the
teacher and punched him.

147
00:11:33,326 --> 00:11:35,763
GEORGE LUCAS (V.O.):
John was on one
of the opposing crews.

148
00:11:35,796 --> 00:11:41,434
Even though we were on opposing
teams, he would still stand up
for you.

149
00:11:41,468 --> 00:11:44,838
Esprit de corps was very
important to him.

150
00:11:44,872 --> 00:11:46,673
HARRISON FORD (V.O.):
He looks up to John as a big
brother figure.

151
00:11:46,706 --> 00:11:51,845
Obviously there's real loyalty
and friendship between the two
of them and a lot of history.

152
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:56,416
I'm not sure it's a big brother
or a crazy uncle.

153
00:12:01,221 --> 00:12:05,826
It was George and John, it was
just a group that all the names
were kind of bunched up.

154
00:12:05,859 --> 00:12:11,164
And always orbiting around the
student film festivals that
they would have every year.

155
00:12:11,198 --> 00:12:14,401
So, I saw his short film
before I ever saw John.

156
00:12:14,434 --> 00:12:16,770
"Marcello I'm So Bored".

157
00:12:16,804 --> 00:12:20,373
That was a fabled film, as John
was working on it...

158
00:12:20,407 --> 00:12:24,044
because he was saying,
"This will be the greatest
film ever seen."

159
00:12:24,077 --> 00:12:27,514
One of the characters, I think
it's the Marcello character,
says...

160
00:12:27,547 --> 00:12:32,820
"I'm gonna be big, really big!
I want to be really,
really big"...

161
00:12:32,853 --> 00:12:38,458
and it was obvious that this was
a guy with an enormous talent
for dialogue.

162
00:12:38,491 --> 00:12:43,797
And that was my first exposure
to what a John Milius was.

163
00:12:43,831 --> 00:12:47,434
MILIUS (V.O.):
That and THX basically
papered the walls.

164
00:12:47,467 --> 00:12:49,469
We won a lot of stuff
with those films.

165
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:54,441
If you went to film school...

166
00:12:54,474 --> 00:12:58,378
the chances of going in the film
industry were still pretty slim.

167
00:12:58,411 --> 00:13:00,147
Forget it,
you're never gonna work.

168
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:05,385
Don't try to make films that you
think will appeal to Hollywood,
because it's not gonna work.

169
00:13:05,418 --> 00:13:07,921
Any of us had as much
of a chance of getting in...

170
00:13:07,955 --> 00:13:10,257
as the proverbial snowball
in hell.

171
00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:14,027
Even though there was no future,
this was a great moment...

172
00:13:14,061 --> 00:13:18,065
where you could actually make
as many movies as you could
possibly get away with.

173
00:13:18,098 --> 00:13:21,201
STEVEN SPIELBERG (V.O.):
When he was coming up,
of all of them...

174
00:13:21,234 --> 00:13:23,871
John was considered
the shining star.

175
00:13:23,904 --> 00:13:29,509
John was considered the most
talented and the one that was
gonna be the great director.

176
00:13:30,543 --> 00:13:36,049
Willard Huyck got me a job
immediately the summer
I got out...

177
00:13:36,083 --> 00:13:39,853
working at American
International Pictures, AIP.

178
00:13:39,887 --> 00:13:42,422
( MUSIC PLAYING )

179
00:13:42,455 --> 00:13:46,059
BUZZ FEITSHANS (V.O.):
We were known
as King of the B Movie.

180
00:13:46,093 --> 00:13:48,061
MILIUS (V.O.):
We make exploitation
films here.

181
00:13:48,095 --> 00:13:53,266
We make things like
"Rape Squad" or "White Mama,
Black Mama".

182
00:13:54,234 --> 00:14:00,440
I hired two young men, hot-shot
graduates from SC Film School...

183
00:14:00,473 --> 00:14:03,443
a surly rascal named
Willard Huyck...

184
00:14:03,476 --> 00:14:09,216
and the other a bombastic big
guy and darty little eyes...

185
00:14:09,249 --> 00:14:13,086
lot of fire and bullshit,
his name was John Milius.

186
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:17,457
I was fired
for insubordination...

187
00:14:17,490 --> 00:14:21,294
and Willard was fired
for surliness.

188
00:14:21,328 --> 00:14:25,098
And then we were re-hired the
next Monday to write a script.

189
00:14:25,132 --> 00:14:27,500
I had an idea for a movie...

190
00:14:27,534 --> 00:14:31,471
it was kind of something stolen
from The Dirty Dozen.

191
00:14:31,504 --> 00:14:34,041
But they didn't have enough
money for a full dozen...

192
00:14:34,074 --> 00:14:35,976
so it's called "The Devil's 8".

193
00:14:38,311 --> 00:14:40,347
All right, they're coming
your way. Let me take it.

194
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:42,449
Wait a second! This thing's
going to explode!

195
00:14:42,482 --> 00:14:47,988
One thing about you, Burl,
you bluff easy, but you make
damn, good whiskey.

196
00:14:48,021 --> 00:14:50,357
It was so bad.

197
00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:53,360
RANDAL KLEISER (V.O.):
There's a kind of a changing
of the guard that happened...

198
00:14:53,393 --> 00:14:56,429
and John was at the forefront
of getting into Hollywood...

199
00:14:56,463 --> 00:14:59,967
because his name was in the
Hollywood Reporter.

200
00:15:01,501 --> 00:15:05,939
And we all went, "Wow, look!
John's name is in the Hollywood
Reporter!"

201
00:15:05,973 --> 00:15:10,343
Because nobody from any film
school had ever gotten into the
business.

202
00:15:10,377 --> 00:15:13,280
And this was like cracking
into it.

203
00:15:13,313 --> 00:15:15,115
PETER BART (V.O.):
Nothing was working about
Hollywood...

204
00:15:15,148 --> 00:15:17,417
and the audience had basically
abandoned the movie business.

205
00:15:19,052 --> 00:15:21,621
The star system had broken
down...

206
00:15:21,654 --> 00:15:24,357
and all the studios were
basically going under.

207
00:15:26,293 --> 00:15:30,230
GEORGE LUCAS (V.O.):
This was in the mid-60's, and
all the people, the Warners...

208
00:15:30,263 --> 00:15:31,965
the Zuckers, the Zanucks...

209
00:15:31,999 --> 00:15:35,468
all the people that created the
industry were retiring...

210
00:15:35,502 --> 00:15:37,204
and selling the studios
to corporations...

211
00:15:37,237 --> 00:15:39,606
that really didn't know that
much about making movies.

212
00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:43,743
So the way people get out
of slumps is by making some
radical choices.

213
00:15:43,776 --> 00:15:47,380
It's a radical choice that
becomes a hit that pulls
everything out of the slump.

214
00:15:47,414 --> 00:15:48,881
It's not by being conventional.

215
00:15:48,915 --> 00:15:54,687
What was clear is that a new
generation had to, you know,
insert itself.

216
00:15:54,721 --> 00:15:57,490
MARTIN SCORSESE (V.O.):
People like Milius
and George Lucas and Coppola...

217
00:15:57,524 --> 00:16:00,493
they all were lucky to come
along at that time.

218
00:16:00,527 --> 00:16:04,097
They fought their way out of the
trenches and into public sight.

219
00:16:04,131 --> 00:16:09,069
They basically went out there
to change the world.

220
00:16:09,102 --> 00:16:11,638
Instead of doors being slammed
in their faces...

221
00:16:11,671 --> 00:16:16,009
the studios were really
welcoming all the new voices.

222
00:16:16,043 --> 00:16:20,447
Man, we were there at the second
California Gold Rush.

223
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:23,650
We were there at the biggest
moment in movie history.

224
00:16:23,683 --> 00:16:26,386
What can you do?
How can you help us?

225
00:16:26,419 --> 00:16:30,323
And John was a...
you know, he can write.

226
00:16:30,357 --> 00:16:32,792
AL RUDDY (V.O.):
When I was a young,
aspiring producer...

227
00:16:32,825 --> 00:16:36,363
I called up an agent,
a friend of mine, Mike Medavoy.

228
00:16:36,396 --> 00:16:41,568
I walk into Al's office, and
I said, "Look, I represent this
really young, talented guy."

229
00:16:41,601 --> 00:16:45,105
If you hire this guy,
I'll owe you one big.

230
00:16:45,138 --> 00:16:49,176
I'll always be indebted.
Oh, I said okay.

231
00:16:49,209 --> 00:16:52,645
So he gives me the name of this
writer, John Milius.

232
00:16:52,679 --> 00:16:55,215
I drive to the apartment.

233
00:16:55,248 --> 00:16:58,585
Door opens up,
this huge bear of a guy.

234
00:16:58,618 --> 00:17:01,788
The apartment was a little
crowded, just the two
of us being there.

235
00:17:01,821 --> 00:17:03,790
But to complicate matters...

236
00:17:03,823 --> 00:17:07,627
John had a Rhodesian Ridgeback,
which is a large dog.

237
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:10,163
It's the size of almost
a small Great Dane.

238
00:17:10,197 --> 00:17:13,400
He pushes the dog aside,
now I'm sitting on the couch...

239
00:17:13,433 --> 00:17:16,336
and the dog, he tried to jump
on the couch...

240
00:17:16,369 --> 00:17:21,241
and I'm trying to tell John my
story, what I'm looking for.

241
00:17:21,274 --> 00:17:23,410
And in typical
John Milius-style, he said...

242
00:17:23,443 --> 00:17:30,150
"I'll tell you what, I like your
story, but I'll take the job on
one other condition."

243
00:17:30,183 --> 00:17:33,820
I said, "What's that?" "You just
have to take this dog with you."

244
00:17:36,256 --> 00:17:39,459
( MUSIC PLAYING )

245
00:17:52,705 --> 00:17:58,145
Ladies and gentlemen, you have
no idea how good it makes me
feel to be here today.

246
00:17:58,178 --> 00:18:02,549
I had asked for a bunch
of really interesting Hollywood
writers...

247
00:18:02,582 --> 00:18:03,483
to come and meet with me...

248
00:18:03,516 --> 00:18:09,689
and in comes Malick
and Huycks and John.

249
00:18:09,722 --> 00:18:12,592
I didn't know John,
I just knew of him.

250
00:18:12,625 --> 00:18:16,163
I- I just want to tell you
about this guy, Evel Knievel...

251
00:18:16,196 --> 00:18:18,698
and Milius said, "That's just
great!"

252
00:18:18,731 --> 00:18:21,568
He just saw that that was
Americana...

253
00:18:21,601 --> 00:18:25,772
and a crazy character that
represented America and he
got it.

254
00:18:25,805 --> 00:18:28,908
So, then I tried to negotiate
with him, and I said...

255
00:18:28,941 --> 00:18:32,445
"You know what, John, I'm
already making lots of movies."

256
00:18:32,479 --> 00:18:35,248
I said, "I know, I know you're
an important writer." I said,
"What do you want?"

257
00:18:35,282 --> 00:18:40,487
He said, "I want girls,
gold and guns."

258
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:44,391
So I called one of my guys and
said go get me some of those old
piston-sprung hookers...

259
00:18:44,424 --> 00:18:45,858
that you know running around
Hollywood.

260
00:18:45,892 --> 00:18:47,327
So they said, "Where is this
gonna be?"

261
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:51,531
I said, "I have a house in Palm
Springs. Anything he needs you
attend to."

262
00:18:51,564 --> 00:18:54,367
Let me ask you something,
I said, "You want the gold,
we're gonna get that for you...

263
00:18:54,401 --> 00:18:56,536
but would you like some
motorcycles?"

264
00:18:56,569 --> 00:18:58,104
"Motorcycles," he said.

265
00:18:58,137 --> 00:19:02,709
So I got him motorcycles and
he was riding on the motorcycles
and he was in love.

266
00:19:02,742 --> 00:19:06,879
He couldn't wait to get down
to Palm Springs.

267
00:19:06,913 --> 00:19:10,883
A week's gone by and I call my
guys up, I have two guys
attending.

268
00:19:10,917 --> 00:19:14,821
I said, "How's it going?"
They said, "Not good."

269
00:19:14,854 --> 00:19:19,659
I said, "What do you mean, not
good?" He said, "He hasn't
written anything." Uh-huh.

270
00:19:19,692 --> 00:19:24,531
He took the script that this
English guy wrote, Alan Caillou
wrote out by the pool.

271
00:19:24,564 --> 00:19:28,167
He beat it with an oar
until it sunk.

272
00:19:29,502 --> 00:19:33,506
So, I said, "You tell him, and
tell him it comes from me.

273
00:19:33,540 --> 00:19:37,444
He can't take the gun,
there'd be no more riding
the motorcycles...

274
00:19:37,477 --> 00:19:42,849
and the girls won't mount up
if he doesn't come through."

275
00:19:42,882 --> 00:19:45,585
I was in the Plaza Hotel
in New York.

276
00:19:45,618 --> 00:19:47,920
15 telegrams arrive for me.

277
00:19:47,954 --> 00:19:51,791
I realize I've this
incredible film...

278
00:19:51,824 --> 00:19:55,262
on telegrams, starting
to come in...

279
00:19:55,295 --> 00:19:59,799
and it goes like 140 telegrams
or 50 telegrams.

280
00:19:59,832 --> 00:20:01,368
I love what I'm reading.

281
00:20:01,401 --> 00:20:04,671
I think he wrote it
in three days, four days.

282
00:20:04,704 --> 00:20:06,639
And he was now a terror.

283
00:20:06,673 --> 00:20:08,975
( MUSIC PLAYING )

284
00:20:11,711 --> 00:20:16,549
You know, John was definitely,
as a writer, valuable to the
studios.

285
00:20:16,583 --> 00:20:19,486
They loved me because I had
written "Dirty Harry".

286
00:20:21,588 --> 00:20:23,590
PETER BART (V.O.):
You know, John's name's
not even on the script...

287
00:20:23,623 --> 00:20:25,625
but he saved that movie.

288
00:20:26,926 --> 00:20:28,928
Character definition that came
from that great dialogue.

289
00:20:28,961 --> 00:20:33,433
I mean, after two lines from
Dirty Harry, you knew exactly
who he was.

290
00:20:33,466 --> 00:20:34,934
( BELLS RINGS )

291
00:20:34,967 --> 00:20:37,337
Being this is a .44 magnum,
the most powerful handgun
in the world...

292
00:20:37,370 --> 00:20:39,506
and would blow your head
clean off...

293
00:20:39,539 --> 00:20:41,874
you've got to ask yourself
one question.

294
00:20:41,908 --> 00:20:46,413
Do I feel lucky?
Well, do ya, punk?

295
00:20:46,446 --> 00:20:48,047
I think he liked the grandiose.

296
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:53,620
He liked something that was...
something that would appeal to...

297
00:20:53,653 --> 00:20:55,655
you know, bordering
on the line...

298
00:20:55,688 --> 00:21:01,528
pushing people to the edge
of where you go from reality
to ridiculous.

299
00:21:01,561 --> 00:21:03,963
But sometimes ridiculous
is more fun.

300
00:21:03,996 --> 00:21:08,668
Those kind of lines
always hang with you.

301
00:21:08,701 --> 00:21:12,805
"Dirty Harry" was a big hit.
I did "Magnum Force" after that.

302
00:21:12,839 --> 00:21:15,975
John, you know, was a really
good writer.

303
00:21:16,008 --> 00:21:18,010
I mean, you know, that's how
you become a favorite.

304
00:21:19,579 --> 00:21:22,749
MILIUS (V.O.):
I remember that Frank Wells,
who was the head of the studio.

305
00:21:22,782 --> 00:21:24,684
He summoned me.

306
00:21:24,717 --> 00:21:27,654
There was a note on my desk
when I came in in the morning...

307
00:21:27,687 --> 00:21:30,690
that Mr. Wells would like
to see you.

308
00:21:30,723 --> 00:21:34,661
Oh, my god, the boss!
The head of the whole studio...

309
00:21:34,694 --> 00:21:37,797
wants to see me for lunch today.
What did I do, you know?

310
00:21:37,830 --> 00:21:40,066
I went over there and he said,
"Sit down, John."

311
00:21:40,099 --> 00:21:44,471
He said, "We're very proud
of you, you know, you've done
all these movies here.

312
00:21:44,504 --> 00:21:45,838
You're our best writer."

313
00:21:45,872 --> 00:21:48,040
We really are very proud
of you and we'd like to show...

314
00:21:48,074 --> 00:21:49,509
but, you know, uh...

315
00:21:49,542 --> 00:21:52,979
you have this coat that you
always wear."

316
00:21:53,012 --> 00:21:55,948
John came to my house
for dinner one night...

317
00:21:55,982 --> 00:22:01,421
and we had a nice dinner and
everybody left and that was
that.

318
00:22:01,454 --> 00:22:04,891
And about three days later,
I said to my wife...

319
00:22:04,924 --> 00:22:09,896
"Is something wrong with your
nose, because there's a dead rat
in the house."

320
00:22:09,929 --> 00:22:12,899
I said, "Yeah, yeah, that's my
Spanish suede coat."

321
00:22:12,932 --> 00:22:16,703
And he said, "Do you have it
with you?" And I said, "Why?"

322
00:22:16,736 --> 00:22:18,871
He said,
"We're going to burn it."

323
00:22:18,905 --> 00:22:21,674
And I open the closet door
and almost fainted...

324
00:22:21,708 --> 00:22:27,980
because John had left his coat
in there by mistake. And that
was the dead rat.

325
00:22:28,014 --> 00:22:31,984
Burn my suede coat, but I've had
that... He says, "I want you to
look out...

326
00:22:32,018 --> 00:22:35,588
in the Horseshoe Driveway
there at Warner Brothers."

327
00:22:35,622 --> 00:22:37,123
He says, "See that?
That's a limousine.

328
00:22:37,156 --> 00:22:42,562
You're gonna get in that
limousine and they're gonna take
you to Beverly Hills.

329
00:22:42,595 --> 00:22:47,967
And there's a salesman there,
he's gonna fit you out
with two sport coats...

330
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,903
two tweed sport coats,
the best they have.

331
00:22:50,937 --> 00:22:56,776
Because we're very proud of you
and we want you to look good and
we just want to burn that one."

332
00:22:59,045 --> 00:23:04,617
I'm gonna feel like I'm losing
something, but I guess I'm
gaining something, too.

333
00:23:04,651 --> 00:23:06,786
He says, "That's a good way
to look at it."

334
00:23:06,819 --> 00:23:12,859
I mean, every script of John's
was great, you know.

335
00:23:12,892 --> 00:23:15,528
It didn't necessarily happen
in the first round...

336
00:23:15,562 --> 00:23:20,500
but John was not the greatest
at rewriting himself...

337
00:23:20,533 --> 00:23:25,037
because I think he thought that
everything he wrote was exactly
the way he wanted it.

338
00:23:25,071 --> 00:23:31,043
"Jeremiah Johnson", they really
only shot about 60 percent
of the script.

339
00:23:32,779 --> 00:23:37,049
John Milius' screenplay was
mythical, as all of Milius'
material is mythical.

340
00:23:37,083 --> 00:23:41,521
But John Milius' screenplay was
primarily a piece of violence...

341
00:23:41,554 --> 00:23:44,123
as almost all of Milius'
stuff is.

342
00:23:44,156 --> 00:23:49,496
The original Milius script was
about a guy who ran out and ate
trees and ate livers.

343
00:23:49,529 --> 00:23:53,165
Ripped Indians' bodies apart and
ate the livers and blood and
screamed.

344
00:23:57,670 --> 00:24:01,941
The work that John did dealt
with something very primal...

345
00:24:01,974 --> 00:24:05,144
and very truthful to the human
condition is...

346
00:24:05,177 --> 00:24:09,248
and was not shy in any way
expressing political opinions...

347
00:24:09,281 --> 00:24:14,587
or behavior that was not
fashionable.

348
00:24:14,621 --> 00:24:19,792
In those days, Milius was
terribly proud...

349
00:24:19,826 --> 00:24:24,497
of his sort of macho image
and played it to the hilt.

350
00:24:24,531 --> 00:24:26,866
Half kidding, half not.

351
00:24:26,899 --> 00:24:31,037
You know, he drove around with
a bunch of shotguns in his car
and hunting dogs.

352
00:24:31,070 --> 00:24:35,575
John, you know, was very
charismatic in that way...

353
00:24:35,608 --> 00:24:38,244
because he aspired to be
bigger than life.

354
00:24:39,879 --> 00:24:45,618
Well, I think John, in many
ways, has a kind of jealousy for
the characters he's written...

355
00:24:45,652 --> 00:24:48,120
and would like to slip into
their costumes and play them.

356
00:24:48,154 --> 00:24:50,122
AMANDA MILIUS (V.O.):
Those are the kind
of characters he likes...

357
00:24:50,156 --> 00:24:51,724
so he wants to be like that.

358
00:24:51,758 --> 00:24:57,997
That's his favorite thing,
is the kind of extreme man
that has no fear.

359
00:24:58,030 --> 00:25:02,802
I didn't really believe it that
much, but I thought it was a
gas.

360
00:25:04,604 --> 00:25:10,176
MARTIN SCORSESE (V.O.):
John Milius is, you know, a
symbol of what the 70's was.

361
00:25:12,812 --> 00:25:16,048
Probably at heart, we're not
terribly far apart.

362
00:25:16,082 --> 00:25:19,819
John is a romantic, I think
at heart, like I am, probably.

363
00:25:19,852 --> 00:25:23,556
And he loved the picture
"Jeremiah Johnson" when it
was finished.

364
00:25:23,590 --> 00:25:26,826
(V.O.)
I think that John's sense
of storytelling...

365
00:25:26,859 --> 00:25:30,129
a sense is dramatic,
a sense of the extreme.

366
00:25:30,162 --> 00:25:33,933
He understands that movies need
to be big to be interesting.

367
00:25:33,966 --> 00:25:38,638
He got a job to write
"Judge Roy Bean".

368
00:25:38,671 --> 00:25:42,008
"Judge Roy Bean" was one of the
most brilliant screenplays
I've ever read.

369
00:25:42,041 --> 00:25:44,176
It was just... it was just
magnificent.

370
00:25:44,210 --> 00:25:47,714
You know, polished and good,
you know, just blew everybody
away.

371
00:25:47,747 --> 00:25:54,754
The work reflected a stand that
was impenetratable, you couldn't
change it...

372
00:25:54,787 --> 00:25:56,889
this guy really believed
in what he was saying.

373
00:25:56,923 --> 00:25:59,926
It was sent to Lee Marvin and
Lee Marvin got the script.

374
00:25:59,959 --> 00:26:05,364
His agent had sent it and he was
reading it and he really liked
it and he got drunk.

375
00:26:05,397 --> 00:26:11,638
And he, you know, left it on his
chair, and went off and passed
out somewhere.

376
00:26:11,671 --> 00:26:16,208
And Newman picked it up
and started reading it,
and took it away.

377
00:26:16,242 --> 00:26:21,981
He called his people in
Los Angeles and said, "Buy this
script! I want to do this."

378
00:26:22,014 --> 00:26:27,019
And so they came to me and they
said now we want to buy
the script.

379
00:26:27,053 --> 00:26:31,023
I said, "Fine, I want
to direct it."

380
00:26:31,057 --> 00:26:32,491
They said, "No, no,
that's not possible."

381
00:26:32,524 --> 00:26:35,728
So there were two prices,
one that was very cheap with me
directing it...

382
00:26:35,762 --> 00:26:40,800
and one that kept going up and
up if they wanted it without me.

383
00:26:40,833 --> 00:26:42,368
And they finally paid
the price without me.

384
00:26:52,178 --> 00:26:56,949
MILIUS (V.O.):
In 1972, 1973, that was a hell
of a lot of money.

385
00:26:56,983 --> 00:27:01,187
LAWRENCE GORDON (V.O.):
You know, there is no good
movie without a good script.

386
00:27:01,220 --> 00:27:03,956
The law says that the guilty
shall be punished.

387
00:27:03,990 --> 00:27:08,160
And I say it should be done
in broad daylight in the open,
not sneaking around.

388
00:27:08,194 --> 00:27:10,162
It wasn't at all the same movie.

389
00:27:10,196 --> 00:27:13,032
I mean, Huston wasn't the right
person to direct it...

390
00:27:13,065 --> 00:27:17,704
and Newman certainly wasn't the
right person to act in it.

391
00:27:17,737 --> 00:27:19,171
And they're all terrific people.

392
00:27:19,205 --> 00:27:22,408
Paul Newman is one of the nicest
and most intelligent people
in the world.

393
00:27:22,441 --> 00:27:26,345
I can't say anything against
him, he just wasn't right
for that movie.

394
00:27:28,147 --> 00:27:31,818
As I got to be more
and more expensive...

395
00:27:31,851 --> 00:27:35,888
I knew that there was a certain
amount of power and that
I could parlay...

396
00:27:35,922 --> 00:27:39,391
that into having somebody
let me direct eventually.

397
00:27:39,425 --> 00:27:43,763
I wanted to be a director,
largely out of self defense.

398
00:27:45,865 --> 00:27:52,438
This process of submitting the
script to somebody who was not
a creative person.

399
00:27:52,471 --> 00:27:57,176
Somebody who went to Stanford
or Harvard who had not
a creative, in his words...

400
00:27:57,209 --> 00:28:01,981
not a creative bone in their
body and have them edit
his script.

401
00:28:02,014 --> 00:28:05,251
It utterly frustrated him,
he hated it.

402
00:28:05,284 --> 00:28:08,220
He hated the people who would
review his scripts...

403
00:28:08,254 --> 00:28:11,490
and he thought that it was
a corruption of what he did.

404
00:28:11,523 --> 00:28:17,429
We had this woman who was our
contact with the studio...

405
00:28:17,463 --> 00:28:22,769
and she came in one day
and John started telling
this story to her.

406
00:28:22,802 --> 00:28:25,371
It was a rather detailed story.

407
00:28:25,404 --> 00:28:32,011
When he got through, she just
stood up and said, "That's not
something that we want to do."

408
00:28:32,044 --> 00:28:35,081
I think you better re-think
that...

409
00:28:35,114 --> 00:28:40,953
that's not a really good
story," and she walked out.

410
00:28:40,987 --> 00:28:45,457
John said, "Well, some people
don't like Macbeth."

411
00:28:45,491 --> 00:28:52,231
He had told her the story
of Macbeth and she didn't know!

412
00:28:54,333 --> 00:28:57,436
MARTIN SCORSESE (V.O.):
John Milius, he was a major
figure at that time...

413
00:28:57,469 --> 00:29:00,907
in my eyes and many people,
as a power player in Hollywood.

414
00:29:03,242 --> 00:29:09,882
I gotta 16 millimeter print
of "Hell's Angels",
the Howard Hughes film.

415
00:29:09,916 --> 00:29:14,954
I remember Spielberg, Schrader,
I think, was there, John and a
few others.

416
00:29:14,987 --> 00:29:19,191
And I said you have to see this
thing, because the aerial
sequences are amazing.

417
00:29:19,225 --> 00:29:22,294
And George was about
to make Star Wars.

418
00:29:22,328 --> 00:29:26,298
Anyway, we showed the film,
and of course it was 16
millimeter black and white.

419
00:29:26,332 --> 00:29:30,536
No tinted scenes, no two-color
process, it's kind of a mess.

420
00:29:30,569 --> 00:29:36,809
Yet, the power of the picture
was so strong, the moment the
last reel finished...

421
00:29:36,843 --> 00:29:40,947
John got up and the projector
bulb was still flashing on the
screen.

422
00:29:40,980 --> 00:29:43,549
He said, "I want to say that
this is the kind of film that
should be made!

423
00:29:43,582 --> 00:29:46,552
And it's the kind of thing we
should have our minds into!"

424
00:29:46,585 --> 00:29:49,221
It was a rally to make pictures
that matter...

425
00:29:49,255 --> 00:29:52,391
to feel so strongly about,
to get up and make a speech.

426
00:29:52,424 --> 00:29:57,329
Immediately as the 16 millimeter
film is winding out
of the projector...

427
00:29:57,363 --> 00:30:00,099
this is passion of film making.

428
00:30:00,132 --> 00:30:06,472
What he wanted to do is be able
to control the vision he saw,
he'd be able to carry out.

429
00:30:06,505 --> 00:30:11,110
And I think that that was why
he wanted to direct.

430
00:30:11,143 --> 00:30:13,412
So I called him, told him
I wanted to come by and see him.

431
00:30:13,445 --> 00:30:17,283
He said, "Come over to my house
tonight. I'm having people over
for dinner."

432
00:30:17,316 --> 00:30:19,618
He was holding court at the
table.

433
00:30:19,651 --> 00:30:23,923
He was "big dealing" me, as they
say, and very rude to me.

434
00:30:23,956 --> 00:30:28,895
And I finally got pissed off
and said, "Well, look, thanks,
I gotta go."

435
00:30:28,928 --> 00:30:30,329
"We're you going, big boy?"

436
00:30:30,362 --> 00:30:34,066
And I said, "I'm leaving,
I've had enough of your
bullshit, I'm going."

437
00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:37,236
"I don't write for that
cheap-ass AIP money any more."

438
00:30:37,269 --> 00:30:39,471
"That's okay, I was gonna let
you direct the movie."

439
00:30:39,505 --> 00:30:42,141
He says, "You're gonna let me
direct it?" I says, "Yeah, I'm
gonna let you direct it."

440
00:30:42,174 --> 00:30:45,377
And, of course,
I would have paid him.

441
00:30:45,411 --> 00:30:48,614
John, John Dillinger.

442
00:30:48,647 --> 00:30:51,283
All right, everybody,
hold it right where you are.
This is a robbery.

443
00:30:51,317 --> 00:30:55,087
He wanted to make movies about
adults finally. They were
enormous morality plays.

444
00:30:55,121 --> 00:30:57,423
He didn't romanticize
Dillinger...

445
00:30:57,456 --> 00:31:01,894
in a way that Coppola
romanticized the
Corleone family.

446
00:31:01,928 --> 00:31:08,500
He basically still said that as
interesting a guy John Dillinger
is, he's a criminal.

447
00:31:08,534 --> 00:31:10,002
Who'd you kill, Reed?

448
00:31:10,036 --> 00:31:14,640
Caught my wife and a Bible
salesman, I got them in a
flagrant delecto.

449
00:31:17,043 --> 00:31:18,810
Let him out.

450
00:31:18,844 --> 00:31:23,682
My expectations were very high,
because that was the most money
AIP had ever spent on a movie.

451
00:31:23,715 --> 00:31:26,518
I think they were hoping to just
get their money back.

452
00:31:29,989 --> 00:31:35,627
LAWRENCE GORDON (V.O.): Got
well-reviewed, well-received.
It met every expectation.

453
00:31:35,661 --> 00:31:38,397
I'd put "Dillinger" right up
there with "Bonnie and Clyde".

454
00:31:38,430 --> 00:31:41,300
It was a great folk crime drama.

455
00:31:41,333 --> 00:31:45,537
He took the genre and explored
it to its fullest.

456
00:31:45,571 --> 00:31:47,673
With "Dillinger",
we had to move on.

457
00:31:47,706 --> 00:31:52,211
A lot of John's ethics come
from a time past.

458
00:31:52,244 --> 00:31:56,682
And so a lot of people, when
they see John or talk to John...

459
00:31:56,715 --> 00:32:02,054
they sort of confuse him
in a contemporary sense.

460
00:32:02,088 --> 00:32:06,358
You think of him more as a man
out of his time.

461
00:32:06,392 --> 00:32:11,130
The movie that really is John,
and sort of has a lot of his
personality in it...

462
00:32:11,163 --> 00:32:15,201
and really has a lot of his
sense of his character...

463
00:32:15,234 --> 00:32:18,437
and his beliefs
is "The Wind and the Lion".

464
00:32:23,375 --> 00:32:29,415
Herb Jaffe over at UA liked
"Dillinger", liked me, thought
I was a very talented writer.

465
00:32:29,448 --> 00:32:34,086
And I told him the story
of "The Wind and the Lion",
and he said, "Go to it".

466
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:41,093
"The Wind and the Lion" is a
crazy movie. I mean great,
entertaining, but crazy.

467
00:32:41,127 --> 00:32:45,131
Let's cast Sean Connery
as a desert prince.

468
00:32:47,699 --> 00:32:52,704
It was fun, you know, and Candy
Bergen who is smitten by him.

469
00:32:53,305 --> 00:32:57,343
This President Roosevelt, he
would try and take it himself?

470
00:32:57,376 --> 00:33:01,480
He certainly would. He is a man
of grit and strong moral fiber.

471
00:33:01,513 --> 00:33:04,116
He does not kidnap women
and children.

472
00:33:04,350 --> 00:33:09,255
And I think Teddy Roosevelt in
that movie is really saying a
lot of John's philosophy.

473
00:33:09,288 --> 00:33:10,622
I mean John loved Teddy
Roosevelt, obviously...

474
00:33:10,656 --> 00:33:16,195
but when Teddy Roosevelt
is describing the American
character...

475
00:33:16,228 --> 00:33:20,699
in terms of the grizzly bear
that he's killed...

476
00:33:20,732 --> 00:33:24,670
that is quintessential
John Milius.

477
00:33:25,471 --> 00:33:30,376
American grizzly bear was
a symbol of the American
character.

478
00:33:30,409 --> 00:33:35,647
Strength, intelligence
and ferocity.

479
00:33:35,681 --> 00:33:42,154
A little blind and reckless
at times, but courageous beyond
all doubt.

480
00:33:42,188 --> 00:33:43,889
It's fabulous.

481
00:33:43,922 --> 00:33:49,461
And I was thinking that he was
making this at the same time
that we were making "Star Wars".

482
00:33:49,495 --> 00:33:55,301
For all the mildness
of George and the wildness
of John...

483
00:33:55,334 --> 00:34:01,607
it's the same story, it's coming
of age, it's history and
adventure.

484
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:06,112
GEORGE LUCAS (V.O.):
Those people live by the code
that John lives by...

485
00:34:06,145 --> 00:34:09,081
and if you understand that,
you understand John.

486
00:34:09,115 --> 00:34:14,420
We always worked on each other's
projects, just like at school
in the beginning.

487
00:34:14,453 --> 00:34:19,125
I mean, when I did "The Wind
and the Lion", George and his
wife Marsha came...

488
00:34:19,158 --> 00:34:22,761
and she was a great editor
and he was a great editor...

489
00:34:22,794 --> 00:34:25,097
so they told me how to move
scenes around.

490
00:34:25,297 --> 00:34:30,802
And Steven was always around.
Steven and I hung around all the
time, you know.

491
00:34:30,836 --> 00:34:34,373
And so Steven was always over
at my house or something.

492
00:34:34,406 --> 00:34:37,643
We were always thinking
of ideas and stuff.

493
00:34:37,676 --> 00:34:42,448
Spielberg would call him up
every once in a while and say,
"Hey, I need a new idea for
this."

494
00:34:42,481 --> 00:34:46,318
And so John was the idea man.

495
00:34:46,352 --> 00:34:49,788
( THEME TO "JAWS" PLAYING )

496
00:34:50,389 --> 00:34:53,759
Well, John had come down to the
Shark Shack with me several
times.

497
00:34:53,792 --> 00:34:55,494
The Shark Shack was out
in the San Fernando Valley.

498
00:34:55,527 --> 00:34:58,730
And it was where we were
building the mechanical shark
and John really enjoyed it...

499
00:34:58,764 --> 00:35:02,734
because he liked to kind of like
stick his whole body into the
maw of the shark.

500
00:35:02,768 --> 00:35:08,707
You have to imagine John,
who always had some girth,
thrust into the shark.

501
00:35:08,740 --> 00:35:11,843
And all you saw was
his rear end and his legs.

502
00:35:11,877 --> 00:35:15,514
And you would suddenly hear John
yelling "Jaws!"...

503
00:35:15,547 --> 00:35:21,387
and it would echo throughout
the belly of the polyurethane,
mechanical steel shark.

504
00:35:21,420 --> 00:35:23,789
But because of that, you know,
John was interested.

505
00:35:23,822 --> 00:35:26,858
I gave John the script to read,
and John read the script and
thought it was a good script.

506
00:35:26,892 --> 00:35:33,165
I gave him some books, that were
really terrifying books about
tiger hunting...

507
00:35:33,199 --> 00:35:35,734
and he employed a lot of those
ideas in "Jaws".

508
00:35:35,767 --> 00:35:41,139
Steven had a great respect
and admiration for John's
ability with dialogue.

509
00:35:41,340 --> 00:35:44,843
And I said, "John, I got this
scene about the U.S.S.
Indianapolis...

510
00:35:44,876 --> 00:35:46,778
it's only two paragraphs long.

511
00:35:46,812 --> 00:35:51,817
But I think this could be an
epiphany for all the other guys
on the boat.

512
00:35:51,850 --> 00:35:55,721
The Richard Dreyfuss character,
the Roy Scheider character, and
the Robert Shaw character.

513
00:35:55,754 --> 00:36:00,659
To be able to share this kind
of catharsis about what happened
in 1945.

514
00:36:00,692 --> 00:36:03,529
But it's too short, and
Howard's not doing any more
writing on the movie...

515
00:36:03,562 --> 00:36:05,531
and will you take a crack
at this?"

516
00:36:05,564 --> 00:36:07,733
And he said, "Sure!"

517
00:36:07,766 --> 00:36:11,670
MILIUS (V.O.):
I wrote it over the phone.

518
00:36:11,703 --> 00:36:14,473
STEVEN SPIELBERG (V.O.):
I got a ten-page monologue back
from John...

519
00:36:14,506 --> 00:36:19,578
a ten-page monologue which
basically was very close to
what's in the movie.

520
00:36:20,379 --> 00:36:23,949
It was the perfect way
of letting the world know...

521
00:36:23,982 --> 00:36:31,189
and the perfect way for us
to know about his personality,
about Quint.

522
00:36:31,657 --> 00:36:37,363
Japanese submarine slammed two
torpedoes into our side, Chief.

523
00:36:37,396 --> 00:36:40,732
It was coming back from the
island of Tinian.

524
00:36:40,766 --> 00:36:45,371
The Lady had just delivered the
bomb, the Hiroshima bomb.

525
00:36:45,404 --> 00:36:49,741
Robert Shaw read all ten pages
and he loved every word...

526
00:36:49,775 --> 00:36:52,478
but Robert said, "I can't say
all this, it's too much to
memorize."

527
00:36:52,511 --> 00:36:57,583
It was a very compelling speech,
but it was a movie by itself. It
was a movie within a movie.

528
00:36:57,616 --> 00:36:59,918
So Robert Shaw sat down and
Robert cut the speech in half.

529
00:36:59,951 --> 00:37:03,455
He did all the editing himself.
He brought it down to five
pages.

530
00:37:03,489 --> 00:37:08,360
Another thing about a shark,
he's got lifeless eyes...

531
00:37:08,394 --> 00:37:12,531
black eyes like a doll's eyes.

532
00:37:12,564 --> 00:37:16,535
My favorite shot in the story
of that scene...

533
00:37:16,568 --> 00:37:23,275
is when he's in the middle of it
and there's this shot on me and
I'm going...

534
00:37:25,344 --> 00:37:29,681
What can you say when you
hear a story like that?

535
00:37:29,715 --> 00:37:34,753
But it's Milius' words and
Shaw's editing that wound up
in the final film.

536
00:37:34,786 --> 00:37:38,557
He has, of course, the gift
of the writer.

537
00:37:38,590 --> 00:37:41,660
He knows how to write lines that
deliver, sum up everything...

538
00:37:41,693 --> 00:37:45,831
and it's not that the scenes
of the lines really stand out...

539
00:37:45,864 --> 00:37:48,767
it's that they sum up the story
and the picture they're
a part of.

540
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:51,503
He knows how to put
the words together.

541
00:37:52,571 --> 00:37:55,941
I had the opportunity at that
point, there was a crossroads...

542
00:37:55,974 --> 00:37:58,677
where I was gonna rewrite
something else
at Warner Brothers...

543
00:37:58,710 --> 00:38:01,913
but I didn't like the way the
movies were done...

544
00:38:01,947 --> 00:38:07,085
and they had tried again
and again in Hollywood to do
Heart of Darkness.

545
00:38:07,118 --> 00:38:11,823
Orson Welles had tried it and
all these other people had tried
it and nobody could do it.

546
00:38:11,857 --> 00:38:14,460
Nobody could lick
"Heart of Darkness".

547
00:38:14,493 --> 00:38:19,431
That was like waving a red flag
in front of a bull.

548
00:38:19,465 --> 00:38:25,837
And I was always talking about
how I want do a Vietnam movie.

549
00:38:25,871 --> 00:38:30,776
Nobody in Hollywood wanted to
touch the hot button of Vietnam
at that time.

550
00:38:30,809 --> 00:38:34,546
It had "The Deer Hunter" but
Apocalypse Now" is different.

551
00:38:34,580 --> 00:38:39,451
WALTER MURCH (V.O.): And nobody
wanted to make a kind of
renegade film about the war...

552
00:38:39,485 --> 00:38:43,422
which is what "Apocalypse Now"
in its DNA is.

553
00:38:43,455 --> 00:38:49,127
And it was a great moment,
because I took that fork in the
road that...

554
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:51,730
you know, was dangerous.

555
00:38:51,763 --> 00:38:55,401
But I said I really should
do my own work.

556
00:38:55,434 --> 00:38:58,537
One of my favorite movies was
"Dr. Strangelove"...

557
00:38:58,570 --> 00:39:01,407
and I wanted to do a kind
of "Dr. Strangelove"
about the Vietnam War...

558
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:04,610
and shoot it in 16 millimeter
and have it be very realistic...

559
00:39:04,643 --> 00:39:08,146
and John had this completely
series of crazy incidents...

560
00:39:08,179 --> 00:39:11,116
that he had gleaned from
veterans that had come back.

561
00:39:11,149 --> 00:39:12,484
and friends of his
that had been over there.

562
00:39:12,518 --> 00:39:18,557
It was his way of exorcising
that inability to be that
hero...

563
00:39:18,590 --> 00:39:23,962
to be that guy who goes into the
military and sacrifices his
life...

564
00:39:23,995 --> 00:39:25,631
or is willing
to sacrifice his life.

565
00:39:25,664 --> 00:39:30,836
He couldn't do those things,
so instead he wrote about it.

566
00:39:30,869 --> 00:39:35,574
And very few people have that,
it's a God-given talent.
That's a talent that he had.

567
00:39:35,607 --> 00:39:37,576
He might have gone to school
and been taught it...

568
00:39:37,609 --> 00:39:40,646
but ultimately that's something
he had within himself.

569
00:39:40,679 --> 00:39:45,984
MILIUS (V.O.): When I took
something that was an absolute
masterpiece of literature...

570
00:39:46,017 --> 00:39:50,989
and had to do it, had to
make it into something,
I couldn't make it...

571
00:39:51,022 --> 00:39:56,895
I couldn't take that and say
I'm just gonna do an adaptation
of "Heart of Darkness".

572
00:39:56,928 --> 00:40:03,669
I had to change "Heart of
Darkness" severely and increase
its horsepower tremendously...

573
00:40:03,702 --> 00:40:07,038
to make something
that would equal the book.

574
00:40:07,072 --> 00:40:12,944
And I think I roundly
succeeded, but only by upping
the ante tremendously.

575
00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:16,448
So I was around George
a lot and Francis.

576
00:40:16,482 --> 00:40:19,718
They were always talking about
Milius and "Apocalypse Now".

577
00:40:19,751 --> 00:40:22,921
I heard it talked about
so often.

578
00:40:22,954 --> 00:40:26,124
GEORGE LUCAS (V.O.): I told
Francis, I said, "Look, if I
don't get THX off the ground...

579
00:40:26,157 --> 00:40:29,961
I'm gonna go with John and
we're gonna try to do this
thing 'Apocalypse Now'".

580
00:40:29,995 --> 00:40:34,766
MILIUS (V.O.):
It was a Zoetrope project when
Francis Coppola had his big
deal at Warner Brothers.

581
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:38,136
BRYAN SINGER (V.O.): Zoetrope
felt very much at the time like
a group of filmmakers...

582
00:40:38,169 --> 00:40:42,841
who were trying to do what
Chaplin and Pickford...

583
00:40:42,874 --> 00:40:47,679
and all those folks were doing
back at United Artists.

584
00:40:47,713 --> 00:40:51,850
Form a company of filmmakers
for filmmakers, by filmmakers.

585
00:40:51,883 --> 00:40:54,653
The word got around that after,
I think, "Godfather II"...

586
00:40:54,686 --> 00:40:57,889
for the conversation, maybe,
it was said that Francis
was gonna direct it.

587
00:40:57,923 --> 00:41:01,693
You know, he was very happy
when Francis took over
"Apocalypse Now".

588
00:41:01,727 --> 00:41:08,033
Francis' vision of "Apocalypse
Now" was about 180 degrees off
from what George's vision was.

589
00:41:08,066 --> 00:41:10,602
Francis was gonna do this giant,
grand thing...

590
00:41:10,636 --> 00:41:15,507
and I was gonna do this crazy
documentary-ish anti-war film,
which was not what John wanted.

591
00:41:15,541 --> 00:41:19,110
At one point Francis turned
to him and told him, he said...

592
00:41:19,144 --> 00:41:24,482
"Just write every scene you've
ever thought of and ever wanted
to put in a movie."

593
00:41:36,294 --> 00:41:39,665
You smell that?
Do you smell that?

594
00:41:39,698 --> 00:41:40,866
What?

595
00:41:40,899 --> 00:41:46,204
Napalm, son. Nothing else
in the world smells like that.

596
00:41:50,208 --> 00:41:53,645
I love the smell of napalm
in the morning.

597
00:41:53,679 --> 00:41:57,649
The line everybody remembers
is him kind of inhaling
and saying...

598
00:41:57,683 --> 00:42:00,251
"I love the smell of napalm
in the morning."

599
00:42:00,285 --> 00:42:03,622
Yeah, people come up to me on
the street today like, "I love
the smell of napalm".

600
00:42:03,655 --> 00:42:05,323
I'm more like,
"I never knew it."

601
00:42:05,356 --> 00:42:11,196
The fact that that line got
picked out by history as an
emblematic line is something...

602
00:42:11,229 --> 00:42:14,566
it's very hard to track.

603
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:20,639
Having said that, "Charlie don't
surf." is a button line.

604
00:42:20,672 --> 00:42:23,875
Well, I mean, it's pretty
hairy in there, isn't it?
It's Charlie's Point.

605
00:42:23,909 --> 00:42:25,577
Charlie don't surf.

606
00:42:25,611 --> 00:42:30,649
What he does is he writes very
dynamic and interesting
and compelling characters...

607
00:42:30,682 --> 00:42:35,220
and then the dialogue comes
from the character.
"Charlie don't surf."

608
00:42:35,854 --> 00:42:40,058
That doesn't sound good coming
from me, but coming from,
you know...

609
00:42:40,091 --> 00:42:43,862
the character that Robert Duvall
played, it's magnificent.

610
00:42:45,030 --> 00:42:49,000
During some of the ADR,
I guess it would have been
John and Francis...

611
00:42:49,034 --> 00:42:52,938
weren't pleased with the tone
of the VOICEOVER work.

612
00:42:52,971 --> 00:42:57,909
What if he were here... the man
they call insane?

613
00:42:57,943 --> 00:43:04,015
I'm sorry, Martin, I liked the
tone you had before starting.
This is a little too light now.

614
00:43:04,049 --> 00:43:07,619
He had a pistol in his
satchel...

615
00:43:07,653 --> 00:43:16,061
and he walked up and he put down
his Colt 45, 1911 government
model.

616
00:43:16,094 --> 00:43:18,897
My dad's a total pacifist,
like hates weapons.

617
00:43:18,930 --> 00:43:22,701
Martin Sheen looked and went,
"What's this for?"
"Put your hand on it.

618
00:43:22,734 --> 00:43:29,107
This is loaded, take a little
CS, one out the spout,
cocked and locked. Now read it."

619
00:43:31,176 --> 00:43:32,944
Dad said it made him nervous.

620
00:43:32,978 --> 00:43:39,785
He was distracted enough by it
not to obsess or focus too much
on how he was delivering stuff.

621
00:43:39,818 --> 00:43:42,187
WILLARD (V.O.):
Charging a man with murder
in this place...

622
00:43:42,220 --> 00:43:47,025
is like handing out speeding
tickets at the Indy 500.

623
00:43:47,058 --> 00:43:52,898
I took the mission. What the
hell else was I gonna do?

624
00:43:52,931 --> 00:43:55,667
Not a lot of writers can do
what John has done.

625
00:43:55,701 --> 00:44:02,173
It feels like a guy who takes
the world of words seriously...

626
00:44:02,207 --> 00:44:07,278
and somebody who knows how
to frame a large concept
or construct.

627
00:44:07,312 --> 00:44:12,684
And let a great actor say a
great line, but the line also
feels like it's winking at you.

628
00:44:12,718 --> 00:44:15,186
The line feels like it's
serious...

629
00:44:15,220 --> 00:44:18,824
but there's also entertainment
value within the line.

630
00:44:18,857 --> 00:44:23,394
Everything memorable
of "Apocalypse Now" was
invented by John Milius.

631
00:44:24,863 --> 00:44:27,265
The horror.

632
00:44:30,235 --> 00:44:31,903
The horror.

633
00:44:31,937 --> 00:44:34,205
He really was taken and swept
away by Conrad...

634
00:44:34,239 --> 00:44:38,977
and the journey or the voyage
of the individual to some form
of self-realization.

635
00:44:39,978 --> 00:44:44,015
Despite what his politics are
outside of the film's...

636
00:44:44,049 --> 00:44:48,419
the agenda in the film is
always, even though it becomes
about courage and honor...

637
00:44:48,453 --> 00:44:50,789
it's really about fear.

638
00:44:50,822 --> 00:44:52,724
It's about how people deal
with fear...

639
00:44:52,758 --> 00:44:56,895
and that is the writer part
of him that I identify with...

640
00:44:56,928 --> 00:45:01,800
where there is a dark place that
has to do with "Do I have the
guts to do this?"

641
00:45:03,068 --> 00:45:05,403
You know, it is about
"The Heart of Darkness".

642
00:45:05,436 --> 00:45:08,006
He understands the heart.

643
00:45:09,407 --> 00:45:12,343
I was flying back to LA
with Francis and he says..

644
00:45:12,377 --> 00:45:14,813
"I'm willing to die
making this movie.

645
00:45:14,846 --> 00:45:18,049
And if I die making this movie,
George will take over.

646
00:45:18,083 --> 00:45:23,955
And if George dies, you'll take
over. And somehow this movie
will get made."

647
00:45:26,491 --> 00:45:30,061
OLIVER STONE (V.O.):
John invested his soul
in that movie and it shows.

648
00:45:30,095 --> 00:45:32,497
It's a beautiful epic.

649
00:45:32,530 --> 00:45:37,903
Coppola and John did amazing
things, they took it out of
this world, which is wonderful.

650
00:45:37,936 --> 00:45:39,938
It's a larger than life movie.

651
00:45:39,971 --> 00:45:44,042
It's Sturm and Drang,
it's Wagner, it's opera.

652
00:45:55,586 --> 00:45:58,289
It was a fitting tribute...

653
00:45:58,323 --> 00:46:02,460
to go someplace dressed
in clothes that John
wouldn't be caught dead in...

654
00:46:02,493 --> 00:46:06,364
but out of respect for the
Academy, he wore, because
he was nominated.

655
00:46:08,099 --> 00:46:12,904
ANNOUNCER (V.O.):
And the award goes to... Kramer
vs. Kramer.

656
00:46:12,938 --> 00:46:16,842
But "Apocalypse", you know,
was beat out in every regard...

657
00:46:16,875 --> 00:46:19,277
from a picture most people
don't remember today.

658
00:46:19,310 --> 00:46:24,449
The Academy, in their wisdom,
just said well, "Kramer", a
little film.

659
00:46:24,482 --> 00:46:28,954
You know, a personal film,
not a big historical epic.

660
00:46:28,987 --> 00:46:30,956
That's the irony
of popular success.

661
00:46:31,990 --> 00:46:36,261
And it made perfect sense,
it made perfect sense that
after the Oscars...

662
00:46:36,294 --> 00:46:39,831
John would want to go to a place
that he feels comfortable in.

663
00:46:39,865 --> 00:46:43,334
Not at so much the Governor's
Ball, but to Tommy's Burger...

664
00:46:43,368 --> 00:46:46,004
and just sit there in full
tuxedo, all of us.

665
00:46:46,037 --> 00:46:49,574
One of the greatest Oscar
after parties I ever went to.

666
00:46:52,443 --> 00:46:55,881
Glory, and all those things
are quite empty words.

667
00:46:55,914 --> 00:46:59,450
Awards and money and everything
else, are always hollow.

668
00:46:59,484 --> 00:47:03,321
The only reward you ever get is
when somebody really likes it
and it moved them, you know?

669
00:47:03,354 --> 00:47:07,492
A guy came up who'd gotten the
Medal of Honor and thanked me
for making the movie.

670
00:47:07,525 --> 00:47:14,065
He said, "At least somebody
understands what we have to do
and why we are soldiers."

671
00:47:14,265 --> 00:47:17,068
That's the only reward
you ever get.

672
00:47:18,236 --> 00:47:20,872
People who try to go
their own way...

673
00:47:20,906 --> 00:47:26,277
and find what is the relevant
art for themselves...

674
00:47:26,311 --> 00:47:30,015
very often are out of synch
by being a little ahead
of the time.

675
00:47:30,048 --> 00:47:32,417
We'd all started making pictures
late 60's, early 70's.

676
00:47:32,450 --> 00:47:35,420
Milius, Coppola, Steven
Spielberg, George Lucas.

677
00:47:35,453 --> 00:47:36,955
Schrader, Terry Malick was
there.

678
00:47:36,988 --> 00:47:41,492
We shared that perspective
of having a film say what we
wanted it to say.

679
00:47:41,526 --> 00:47:46,932
Your good writing is somewhat
autobiographical, because that's
really what you feel.

680
00:47:46,965 --> 00:47:48,633
That's the passion
that comes out.

681
00:47:48,666 --> 00:47:56,341
And John kind of saw surfing as
this wonderful art-Zen-Buddhist,
Kurosawa kind of thing.

682
00:47:56,374 --> 00:48:00,378
MILIUS (V.O.):
Even though I regularly went
surfing and I was still good...

683
00:48:00,411 --> 00:48:04,515
I realized that I wasn't
as good anymore.

684
00:48:04,549 --> 00:48:08,619
And that I was drifting away
from the beach and from the
people.

685
00:48:08,653 --> 00:48:17,062
And that in time, I probably
would drift so far away that I
really didn't know it anymore.

686
00:48:17,095 --> 00:48:21,332
So I parlayed all that into
saying, "Well, I want to do
my personal film.

687
00:48:21,366 --> 00:48:23,634
I want to do a film
about surfing."

688
00:48:29,607 --> 00:48:35,113
GERRY LOPEZ (V.O.) I mean,
Hollywood, you know, hadn't
done surfing that much justice.

689
00:48:35,146 --> 00:48:41,552
You know, the Hollywood version
of surfing was pretty far off
from what the reality of it was.

690
00:48:43,354 --> 00:48:46,124

That's the name of the game

693
00:48:50,661 --> 00:48:53,431
They never really got it.

694
00:48:53,464 --> 00:48:56,201
John got in touch with me...

695
00:48:56,234 --> 00:49:00,605
and, you know, it's John's style
to just have conversations
with people...

696
00:49:00,638 --> 00:49:03,074
in a way of gathering material.

697
00:49:03,108 --> 00:49:04,976
DENNY AABERG (V.O.):
You know, we'd get lunch
and sit down...

698
00:49:05,010 --> 00:49:08,513
and turn on a tape recorder
and start talking stories.

699
00:49:08,546 --> 00:49:11,582
When we started in the late
50's, early 60's...

700
00:49:11,616 --> 00:49:15,486
surfing really wasn't
a nationwide word, you know?

701
00:49:15,520 --> 00:49:17,522
A lot of people didn't
understand surfing.

702
00:49:17,555 --> 00:49:21,326
It took some guts to go out
there in big waves
and challenge yourself.

703
00:49:21,359 --> 00:49:25,096
( THEME TO "BIG WEDNESDAY"
PLAYING )

704
00:49:27,798 --> 00:49:33,238
Everybody expected that to be
the small movie that does
really well...

705
00:49:33,271 --> 00:49:37,342
it was going to be the picture
that year at Warner Brothers.

706
00:49:37,375 --> 00:49:41,446
But sometimes, I think the
producers would get a little
impatient..

707
00:49:41,479 --> 00:49:43,748
because John liked to take
his time, you know?

708
00:50:16,681 --> 00:50:23,054
I got a note one time
from Warner Brothers,
and they said...

709
00:50:23,088 --> 00:50:28,326
"We would like you to make some
changes to the script and we're
sending over some ideas.

710
00:50:28,359 --> 00:50:33,331
And would you please blue-page
this script for us...

711
00:50:33,364 --> 00:50:35,800
so that we can see
our changes?"

712
00:50:36,401 --> 00:50:43,308
John took the thing and he said,
"Okay, here are the pages that
we gave them.

713
00:50:43,341 --> 00:50:49,647
Go out and put them on blue
paper and then send them
back to them."

714
00:50:49,680 --> 00:50:51,782
And that's what we did.

715
00:50:51,816 --> 00:50:55,286
We gave them the original script
on blue pages...

716
00:50:55,320 --> 00:51:00,225
and we got a call and they said,
"Oh, it's fantastic!"

717
00:51:00,258 --> 00:51:03,094
So obviously nobody had ever
read them.

718
00:51:03,128 --> 00:51:05,496
STEVEN SPIELBERG (V.O.):
You know he is the 300-pound
gorilla.

719
00:51:05,530 --> 00:51:08,433
I mean, people loved him,
people hated him.

720
00:51:08,466 --> 00:51:14,205
John was always, and I think
is today, regarded as kind
of a maverick.

721
00:51:14,239 --> 00:51:20,511
You know, this wild anarchist,
is that fair to say?

722
00:51:20,545 --> 00:51:22,347
( SURF ROCK FADES UP )

723
00:51:35,460 --> 00:51:39,497
DENNY AABERG (V.O.)
"Big Wednesday", as John says,
was a very personal movie.

724
00:51:39,530 --> 00:51:43,201
Both of us drew from people we
knew from the beach.

725
00:51:43,234 --> 00:51:45,603
We tried to make it as real
as possible, and authentic...

726
00:51:45,636 --> 00:51:50,775
so all those characters,
one way or another, were based
on somebody we actually knew.

727
00:51:50,808 --> 00:51:55,913
The name The Bear, really wasn't
so much his nickname...

728
00:51:55,946 --> 00:52:00,918
although The Bear character
in "Big Wednesday" was really
based on him...

729
00:52:00,951 --> 00:52:05,490
somebody that had a commanding
presence and then it was the
storyteller...

730
00:52:05,523 --> 00:52:10,895
and the leader of the group,
you know, and all those things
that John is.

731
00:52:10,928 --> 00:52:15,433
WILLIAM KATT (V.O.):
He was very much the commander
of that set...

732
00:52:15,466 --> 00:52:20,738
and John really commanded that
setting like a general.

733
00:52:20,771 --> 00:52:23,674
Many, many, many lunches,
we'd find John in the water.

734
00:52:23,708 --> 00:52:26,444
He'd have the water cleared and
he'd be out there surfing.

735
00:52:38,923 --> 00:52:42,427
( MUSIC CONTINUES )

736
00:52:46,631 --> 00:52:49,567
If Gary Busey or myself
or Jan or Michael...

737
00:52:49,600 --> 00:52:56,807
if we didn't know our lines or
we were uncertain about it, we
could get John to tell a story.

738
00:52:56,841 --> 00:52:59,944
And that would buy us
at least an hour.

739
00:52:59,977 --> 00:53:03,581
But all of that is part of that
package of John Milius.

740
00:53:03,614 --> 00:53:06,484
He's still very much
in control of the set...

741
00:53:06,517 --> 00:53:11,222
and the one thing you can't say
about John Milius is that he
wastes time.

742
00:53:11,422 --> 00:53:14,659
GERRY LOPEZ (V.O.):
I think "Big Wednesday" is a
romantic movie.

743
00:53:14,692 --> 00:53:21,932
The romance is surfing,
you know, and John's tremendous
love for that time of his life.

744
00:53:22,500 --> 00:53:25,202
I'm doing a lot of surfing, man.

745
00:53:25,436 --> 00:53:30,541
No, just when it's necessary.

746
00:53:30,575 --> 00:53:31,976
Let's go ride some waves.

747
00:53:33,644 --> 00:53:37,014
NAT SEGALOFF (V.O.):
Well, I think that was a big
part of John's childhood.

748
00:53:37,047 --> 00:53:41,386
Growing up and becoming a man
and learning how to tell
stories.

749
00:53:41,419 --> 00:53:44,455
There's never been a surfing
movie in history like
"Big Wednesday".

750
00:53:44,489 --> 00:53:46,257
It wasn't a documentary.

751
00:53:46,291 --> 00:53:48,759
JACK (V.O.)
My friends and I would sleep
in our cars...

752
00:53:48,793 --> 00:53:51,596
and the smell of the offshore
wind would often wake us.

753
00:53:51,629 --> 00:53:55,866
And each morning, we knew this
would be a special day.

754
00:53:59,837 --> 00:54:01,939
STEVEN SPIELBERG (V.O.):
I'd wanted to see
"Big Wednesday"...

755
00:54:01,972 --> 00:54:04,675
long before it was ever
released, because it didn't
release...

756
00:54:04,709 --> 00:54:05,943
it was allowed to escape.

757
00:54:05,976 --> 00:54:11,549
They had these partnerships and
they basically sold the movie...

758
00:54:11,582 --> 00:54:14,285
and once they had sold the
movie, there wasn't any
incentive...

759
00:54:14,319 --> 00:54:18,456
for them to put more money
into the advertising and
publicity department.

760
00:54:19,624 --> 00:54:21,826
It was killed by the executives
at Warner Brothers.

761
00:54:21,859 --> 00:54:26,797
Sort of a "Yes, we like it, but
we don't really believe in it."

762
00:54:26,831 --> 00:54:31,469
It wasn't received as well as
had been anticipated, only in
the coastal cities.

763
00:54:31,502 --> 00:54:34,339
But there were some people who
simply didn't like John...

764
00:54:34,372 --> 00:54:37,074
didn't like the Kurosawa-ness
he was trying to give
the film...

765
00:54:37,107 --> 00:54:39,410
and thought it was too mythical
and metaphoric.

766
00:54:42,012 --> 00:54:43,814
GERRY LOPEZ (V.O.):
Boy, the reviews were bad...

767
00:54:43,848 --> 00:54:45,416
you know, they called it the
"Endless Bummer".

768
00:54:45,450 --> 00:54:47,518
They had to pull it
from distribution.

769
00:54:47,552 --> 00:54:50,855
I don't think the criticism
hurt John.

770
00:54:50,888 --> 00:54:55,660
He felt that it affected how
many people saw his movies...

771
00:54:55,693 --> 00:55:02,467
and I think for any of those
guys, it was about getting
people to see their movies.

772
00:55:30,995 --> 00:55:35,733
There was a whole new generation
of films that were kind
of coming into the fold.

773
00:55:36,100 --> 00:55:39,870
He wanted to be John Ford,
and he wanted to have those
movies that got out there.

774
00:55:40,471 --> 00:55:43,774
Francis, George Lucas, Steven
Spielberg and John Milius...

775
00:55:43,808 --> 00:55:47,912
were sort of the Four Horsemen
of the Apocalypse, or whatever
you want to call it.

776
00:55:47,945 --> 00:55:52,383
The enfant terrible of a new
generation in Hollywood.

777
00:55:52,417 --> 00:55:57,688
Well, of course, George went and
did "Star Wars" and Steven was
coming off "Close Encounters"...

778
00:55:57,722 --> 00:56:02,727
and movies were starting to move
into that blockbuster arena.

779
00:56:09,500 --> 00:56:13,070
I first met John as a young
screenwriter in Hollywood
in the mid-70's, late 70'S...

780
00:56:13,103 --> 00:56:17,975
he was quite successful
and well-known as the author
of "Apocalypse Now".

781
00:56:18,008 --> 00:56:21,579
I met him and he was a
blustering...

782
00:56:21,612 --> 00:56:25,750
fascinated by guns and my own
experience in Vietnam...

783
00:56:25,783 --> 00:56:30,154
and asked me a lot of questions
and, John had a love of war
which I didn't.

784
00:56:30,187 --> 00:56:32,723
So we were coming at it
from completely different points
of view...

785
00:56:32,757 --> 00:56:38,496
and I guess he saw me as a lefty
and I saw him as a crazed
right-wing nut case.

786
00:56:38,529 --> 00:56:43,033
But we enjoyed each other,
we laughed and I had written
"Conan the Barbarian".

787
00:56:43,468 --> 00:56:46,571
What I liked about "Conan"
and I think what John liked
about it...

788
00:56:46,604 --> 00:56:49,607
was that there was a primal
presence behind it.

789
00:56:49,640 --> 00:56:53,911
And that was Howard's
celebration of the
barbarian...

790
00:56:53,944 --> 00:56:59,450
and the barbarian's ethos in
drinking and eating, sex, life.

791
00:56:59,484 --> 00:57:03,988
It seemed like that was
something he worked on more than
anything I can remember.

792
00:57:04,021 --> 00:57:07,124
And he religiously worked on it,
all the time...

793
00:57:07,157 --> 00:57:11,596
and constantly was reworking it,
and really was passionate
about it.

794
00:57:11,629 --> 00:57:16,667
And that was really the sort of,
you know, if anything,
a comeback.

795
00:57:16,701 --> 00:57:19,970
I knew that that was a very,
very important project to John.

796
00:57:20,004 --> 00:57:24,074
We ended up selling the damn
thing to Dino De Laurentiis.

797
00:57:24,108 --> 00:57:27,177
He had the intention of scoring
as much cash as he could
and getting out.

798
00:57:27,211 --> 00:57:29,847
And as John wrapped up
the conversation,
he said...

799
00:57:29,880 --> 00:57:34,485
"Well, Conan had to spend time
on the wheel of pain and I had
to spend time with Dino."

800
00:57:34,519 --> 00:57:37,988
( "MAMBO ITALIANO" PLAYING )

801
00:57:38,022 --> 00:57:43,861
OLIVER STONE (V.O.): When he
was working with Dino on Conan,
John loves to have an enemy.

802
00:57:43,894 --> 00:57:48,766
Dino had, at the time, a huge
desk, it was enormous...

803
00:57:48,799 --> 00:57:54,905
and John and I were sitting
in two chairs on the other side
of this huge desk.

804
00:57:54,939 --> 00:58:00,110
And the chairs were very low, so
when you were sitting there just
normally, the desk was here.

805
00:58:00,144 --> 00:58:05,149
Dino said, "Well, who do you
want to be in this movie?"

806
00:58:05,182 --> 00:58:08,619
And we said, "Arnold
Schwarzenegger."

807
00:58:08,653 --> 00:58:13,824
And he jumped up on top of his
desk and walked across the desk,
and said...

808
00:58:13,858 --> 00:58:19,263
"I'm not doing this movie
with Arnold Schwarzenegger!"

809
00:58:19,296 --> 00:58:26,036
And John said, "Oh, okay, okay."
He sits down, he says, "Now, who
you want?"

810
00:58:26,070 --> 00:58:32,943
John sat there, he said,
"Dustin Hoffman."

811
00:58:35,112 --> 00:58:38,282
"Ah, get out!
Go make the movie."

812
00:58:42,286 --> 00:58:45,255
Well, I loved what he did
with Conan...

813
00:58:45,289 --> 00:58:49,927
and he was sort of responsible
for getting Arnold going
with that picture.

814
00:58:49,960 --> 00:58:53,931
REPORTER (V.O.): I was thinking
very clearly about it, you
created Arnold Schwarzenegger.

815
00:58:53,964 --> 00:58:58,235
MILIUS (V.O.):
You know when I was trying to
talk Dino into using Arnold...

816
00:58:58,268 --> 00:59:00,871
I said if we could have Arnold,
we'd have to build him.

817
00:59:00,905 --> 00:59:06,343
I was always told that my body
and my accent...

818
00:59:06,376 --> 00:59:10,581
would be all obstacles
to being a leading man...

819
00:59:10,615 --> 00:59:15,152
and so John kind of has
confirmed the opposite.

820
00:59:15,185 --> 00:59:20,057
He totally understood
you know, my style of acting.

821
00:59:20,090 --> 00:59:23,260
Conan, what is best in life?

822
00:59:23,293 --> 00:59:26,764
To crash your enemies,
see them driven before you.

823
00:59:26,797 --> 00:59:30,267
And hear the lamentation
of their women.

824
00:59:30,300 --> 00:59:34,171
When Arnold got on the set,
I heard him say...

825
00:59:34,204 --> 00:59:37,775
"John, I'm not an actor like
these guys...

826
00:59:37,808 --> 00:59:41,812
so you tell me what to do,
when to do it and how to do it."

827
00:59:41,846 --> 00:59:47,752
John's eyes lit up. I think
there's nothing more he wanted
to hear than that.

828
00:59:47,785 --> 00:59:52,289
When that was achieved, all
Arnold had to do was stand
there...

829
00:59:52,322 --> 00:59:56,761
be in front of the camera
and listen... and execute.

830
00:59:56,794 --> 01:00:00,831
He didn't have to think, didn't
have to rationalize, didn't have
to think about character...

831
01:00:00,865 --> 01:00:06,637
and I says, "John, would you
direct me that way, too?"

832
01:00:06,671 --> 01:00:08,873
Because it was a wonderful way
to work.

833
01:00:08,906 --> 01:00:11,742
If you trust your director...

834
01:00:11,776 --> 01:00:16,814
just count on him to tell you
when to twitch, when to blink,
when to breathe.

835
01:00:16,847 --> 01:00:18,983
Now that's real trust.

836
01:00:19,016 --> 01:00:21,351
He really made it a joy
to get into acting...

837
01:00:21,385 --> 01:00:25,890
and it made it a joy to be part
of a big project like that.

838
01:00:25,923 --> 01:00:27,792
I think my favorite movie that
John directed was "Conan".

839
01:00:27,825 --> 01:00:29,960
It just had a very strong
effect on me as a kid.

840
01:00:30,995 --> 01:00:32,329
CLINT EASTWOOD (V.O.):
That picture did well.

841
01:00:35,933 --> 01:00:37,167
The first one,
which was R-rated...

842
01:00:37,201 --> 01:00:40,170
got a lot of protest
from parents whose kids
went to see it...

843
01:00:40,204 --> 01:00:43,040
and who found it to be extremely
gruesome and extremely bloody.

844
01:00:43,073 --> 01:00:45,275
And it basically is just
a movie comic book.

845
01:00:45,309 --> 01:00:46,911
If anybody thought it was
violent...

846
01:00:46,944 --> 01:00:49,213
I believe it was because the
violence was effective.

847
01:00:49,246 --> 01:00:52,149
Now John doesn't kill people
in his films unless there's
a reason.

848
01:00:52,182 --> 01:00:53,217
He doesn't have violence
or death...

849
01:00:53,250 --> 01:00:55,720
unless there's an important
dramatic reason for it.

850
01:01:16,306 --> 01:01:19,176
I think he took a genre...

851
01:01:19,209 --> 01:01:24,348
that up until that time had
been very tongue-in-cheek...

852
01:01:24,381 --> 01:01:26,383
very swashbuckling...

853
01:01:26,416 --> 01:01:32,857
and made it savage and sexual
and violent and magical.

854
01:01:33,924 --> 01:01:37,895
And it pre-dated,
and yet...

855
01:01:37,928 --> 01:01:41,265
inspired a slew,
an endless slew...

856
01:01:41,298 --> 01:01:48,205
of fantasy realm pieces that we
see now like "Game of Thrones".

857
01:01:48,238 --> 01:01:53,477
I think it encapsulated all
the things that John was always
taken with...

858
01:01:53,510 --> 01:01:58,048
outside of the movie business,
that he thought he could bring
into the movie business.

859
01:01:58,082 --> 01:02:02,186
Ironically, I think met much
of that sensibility...

860
01:02:02,219 --> 01:02:08,258
is what exists in a lot of the
really successful comic
book-type movies...

861
01:02:08,292 --> 01:02:13,030
that are being made today, and I
think John was probably a bit
ahead of his time.

862
01:02:13,063 --> 01:02:14,431
REPORTER (O.C.): Would you have
wanted to continue doing it?

863
01:02:14,464 --> 01:02:17,167
Yeah, I would have loved to have
made a trilogy.

864
01:02:17,201 --> 01:02:19,837
If I had done the other two
of the trilogy...

865
01:02:19,870 --> 01:02:22,272
he would have been a marvelous
hero like Achilles.

866
01:02:22,306 --> 01:02:27,912
He would have been a hero who
sulked and ran away and was
forced into things...

867
01:02:27,945 --> 01:02:31,816
and had great rages,
great melancholies...

868
01:02:31,849 --> 01:02:35,485
and unfortunately
I never got to do that.

869
01:02:35,519 --> 01:02:38,823
He made the most defining films
of those decades.

870
01:02:39,056 --> 01:02:42,860
I mean, he... I think he
ultimately was very political...

871
01:02:42,893 --> 01:02:46,063
so even though his films
were really heightened,
like "Conan"...

872
01:02:46,096 --> 01:02:49,834
they captured part of the
political zeitgeist
at that time.

873
01:02:50,067 --> 01:02:54,939
"Ten Soldiers" was a very
interesting screenplay...

874
01:02:54,972 --> 01:02:57,808
by a young filmmaker
named Kevin Reynolds.

875
01:02:58,042 --> 01:03:00,310
When I read it, I said to
myself...

876
01:03:00,344 --> 01:03:07,084
this could be a fascinating
low budget movie with an
anti-war statement.

877
01:03:08,218 --> 01:03:12,422
Either smartly or foolishly,
I approached John about it.

Milius who was not the NRA...

possible to use this setting...

881
01:03:25,870 --> 01:03:28,338
to make an interesting
anti-war picture, if you will.

The conventional war,

was something we had been
hearing about a lot in the

It's a very alarming prospect,
a limited nuclear exchange...

888
01:04:00,504 --> 01:04:04,841
because that's... it will lead
to the type of war described
in the movie.

Instead of making
"Lord of the Flies"...

894

he was going to make a picture
who's sensibility was a little
more NRA-ish.

895

Well, "Red Dawn" came out at a
time where there was a lot of
sensitivity...

and desire for some kind
of harmony between the
United States and Russia.

So to say, "Well, what if we
went the other way?"

898

I mean, that was not a very
popular thing...

were all asking at that time.

01:06:05,229 --> 01:06:09,233
so that this nation shall not
perish from the earth.

921
01:06:09,599 --> 01:06:15,105
He's not afraid to take
responsibility for his beliefs.

922
01:06:15,139 --> 01:06:16,773
And even more than his
beliefs...

923
01:06:16,806 --> 01:06:21,245
he's not afraid to kind of like
look the dragon in the face.

924
01:06:21,278 --> 01:06:26,416
He is the guy who we ride into
battle with "Ride of the
Valkyries" blasting.

925
01:06:26,450 --> 01:06:29,086
I mean, he is that guy.

926
01:06:29,119 --> 01:06:32,322
That's a tough thing to do,
take responsibility for that...

927
01:06:32,356 --> 01:06:33,723
for really saying things.

928
01:06:33,757 --> 01:06:38,128
Perfect example, and you know,
I mean, I almost hate to say
it...

929
01:06:38,162 --> 01:06:39,363
but it's something that John,
you know...

930
01:06:39,396 --> 01:06:44,368
I remember at one point, John,
in a somewhat joking mood...

931
01:06:44,401 --> 01:06:49,073
He said, "My fantasy...",
it's insane...

932
01:06:49,106 --> 01:06:57,681
"was to fly across tree tops
and drop fire on children."

933
01:06:59,449 --> 01:07:02,452
And then that big smile.

934
01:07:02,486 --> 01:07:06,556
DARREN DALTON (V.O.):
There's not a lot of people
in Hollywood gonna say that.

935
01:07:06,590 --> 01:07:10,627
Well, is he setting me up?
Is he telling the truth?
What's going on and...

936
01:07:10,660 --> 01:07:13,397
yeah, okay, that maybe could
happen. Oh, no, that's bullshit.

937
01:07:13,430 --> 01:07:15,832
No, that wouldn't happen.
Well, it might happen.

938
01:07:15,865 --> 01:07:18,568
And I thought,
I fucking love this guy.

939
01:07:18,602 --> 01:07:20,204
( THEME MUSIC PLAYING )

940
01:07:20,237 --> 01:07:23,240
COMMENTATOR (V.O.):
We look at the film that has
taken America by storm.

941
01:07:23,273 --> 01:07:26,410
A new American film has just
been released in London...

942
01:07:26,443 --> 01:07:29,113
that's already breaking box
office records in America.

943
01:07:29,146 --> 01:07:31,248
Soviet officials have gone
on the offensive...

944
01:07:31,281 --> 01:07:34,651
against what they see as an
American 35 millimeter weapon.

945
01:07:34,684 --> 01:07:37,454
So, then what is this picture
that had landslide Reagan...

946
01:07:37,487 --> 01:07:41,158
and his erstwhile saber-rattler,
Alexander Haig cheering lustily
in their seats?

947
01:07:41,191 --> 01:07:45,495
Well, I'll tell you, it's called
"Red Dawn" and it's a piece
of right-wing jingoism.

948
01:07:45,529 --> 01:07:48,265
In America, it caused
a political storm.

949
01:07:48,298 --> 01:07:50,567
They are promoting
international hatred.

950
01:07:50,600 --> 01:07:52,736
"Red Dawn",
directed energetically...

951
01:07:52,769 --> 01:07:55,572
but crudely by John Milius,
is frankly ludicrous.

952
01:07:55,605 --> 01:07:58,108
But I think it's more than that,
I think it's highly
irresponsible.

953
01:07:58,142 --> 01:08:01,845
I think this is really a program
designed for high school
students...

954
01:08:01,878 --> 01:08:03,747
not very bright high school
students.

955
01:08:03,780 --> 01:08:06,283
And by way of a footnote,
let me add that the...

956
01:08:06,316 --> 01:08:08,785
U.S. National Coalition
On TV and Movie Violence...

957
01:08:08,818 --> 01:08:11,521
the trans-Atlantic chapter
of the Mary Whitehouse
brigade...

958
01:08:11,555 --> 01:08:14,391
has declared "Red Dawn" to be
the most violent film ever.

959
01:08:14,424 --> 01:08:17,261
It definitely had
a cultural impact.

960
01:08:17,294 --> 01:08:19,496
And although it was
a huge hit...

961
01:08:19,529 --> 01:08:23,167
it was not a hit among the
people who supposedly are the
opinion makers.

962
01:08:23,200 --> 01:08:25,402
DARREN DALTON (V.O.):
Well, I took a lot of heat
after doing the movie.

963
01:08:25,435 --> 01:08:28,538
I remember one director
in particular, I don't
remember his name.

964
01:08:28,572 --> 01:08:33,543
You know, I just came in for
a reading for a movie, maybe
a year or two afterwards.

965
01:08:33,577 --> 01:08:39,249
And he said, "Oh, I see you were
in "Red Dawn", "Red Dawn".

966
01:08:39,283 --> 01:08:42,452
Why would you do a movie
like "Red Dawn"?

967
01:09:30,434 --> 01:09:36,273
That movie, more than anything,
made him a pariah for a long
time.

968
01:09:36,306 --> 01:09:38,708
You just didn't want to be
around this guy...

969
01:09:38,742 --> 01:09:43,747
because his politics
were just too out there.

970
01:09:43,980 --> 01:09:47,917
We never set out to make
a pro-war movie.

971
01:09:47,951 --> 01:09:50,387
Whether it's intentional
or unintentional...

972
01:09:50,420 --> 01:09:53,557
John's work is filled
with humanity...

973
01:09:53,590 --> 01:09:58,995
and filled with ambiguity far
more than his politics are.

974
01:09:59,028 --> 01:10:02,799
And I love John, I love his
character, and there's a
wonderful side to him...

975
01:10:02,832 --> 01:10:06,303
but I would never for one second
would think that he has any
sense of reality.

976
01:10:06,336 --> 01:10:08,938
And it's funny probably for me
to say that to you...

977
01:10:08,972 --> 01:10:11,941
but I just don't think...
he's a cartoon when
it comes to politics.

978
01:10:11,975 --> 01:10:15,679
There's no progress in his
thinking, it's just the
right-wing...

979
01:10:15,712 --> 01:10:19,283
I won't even say right-wing,
because he thinks they're nut
cases now.

980
01:10:19,316 --> 01:10:24,020
But back in those days,
everything he said about
libertarianism...

981
01:10:24,053 --> 01:10:29,259
he still believes in, he hasn't
grown as a man that way.

982
01:10:29,293 --> 01:10:34,498
"Red Dawn" brings us into a
discussion of the R-word in
Hollywood, which is Republican.

983
01:10:34,531 --> 01:10:38,402
There is definitely a...

984
01:10:38,435 --> 01:10:42,906
a preference, a political
preference in Hollywood.

985
01:10:42,939 --> 01:10:46,510
And there's a contention
among the Republicans
and right-wingers...

986
01:10:46,543 --> 01:10:49,746
that they don't have as many
opportunities as liberals or
left-wingers do...

987
01:10:49,779 --> 01:10:52,416
because Hollywood is basically
a left-wing town.

988
01:10:52,449 --> 01:10:58,288
And I think if you are a little
outspoken like John, it can... it
can backfire on you.

989
01:10:58,322 --> 01:11:00,290
Especially when other people
are very adamant...

990
01:11:00,324 --> 01:11:04,961
and extremely political,
no question about it.

991
01:11:04,994 --> 01:11:09,433
He made himself into this
showman of the right
in the period where...

992
01:11:09,466 --> 01:11:14,571
not that it's changed that much,
but Hollywood was defiantly
liberal.

993
01:11:14,604 --> 01:11:18,408
I think John actually enjoyed
making people uncomfortable.

994
01:11:18,442 --> 01:11:22,679
Um, he would say and do things
for the shock value.

995
01:11:22,712 --> 01:11:27,417
Yeah, it's hard to understand
John in terms of... I mean,
I know John the person...

996
01:11:27,451 --> 01:11:32,389
and he's sweet, lovable,
wonderful, honest...

997
01:11:32,422 --> 01:11:35,959
very loyal, you know,
great guy.

998
01:11:35,992 --> 01:11:39,829
And then he's created
this... persona.

999
01:11:41,998 --> 01:11:43,400
He once told me something
really interesting.

1000
01:11:43,433 --> 01:11:47,671
He said, "I may not be the
strongest guy or the most
well-armed...

1001
01:11:47,704 --> 01:11:53,343
but you can put me in a room
with a pencil and a piece of
paper and I can kill anybody."

1002
01:11:53,377 --> 01:11:57,046
Discussing the persona
of John Milius and how
he would use this...

1003
01:11:57,080 --> 01:12:00,850
and of course we've got him
wanting a gun every time
he makes a deal.

1004
01:12:00,884 --> 01:12:04,120
Well, I remember we went into
a meeting with Dan Melnick...

1005
01:12:04,153 --> 01:12:07,557
who was running MGM at the time.

1006
01:12:07,591 --> 01:12:10,694
Melnick was gonna give us his
script notes. He's the president
of the studio.

1007
01:12:10,727 --> 01:12:15,799
John comes in and he pulls out
a pistol and he says...

1008
01:12:15,832 --> 01:12:19,436
"I just want you to know where
we all stand on this, Dan."

1009
01:12:19,469 --> 01:12:23,840
What kind of notes is the head
of the studio gonna give you...

1010
01:12:23,873 --> 01:12:27,777
when there's a .45 automatic
sitting there on the table?

1011
01:12:28,011 --> 01:12:33,450
John just did it for effect,
but it was a great effect and
made everybody tell stories.

1012
01:12:33,483 --> 01:12:37,053
Well, once these stories
started getting around...

1013
01:12:37,086 --> 01:12:40,690
you know, we're all paid
professional liars
in Hollywood...

1014
01:12:40,724 --> 01:12:44,561
we embellish these stories,
they get embellished in the
telling and, you know...

1015
01:12:44,594 --> 01:12:47,431
not too many people in Hollywood
knew anybody that was running
around with a gun.

1016
01:12:48,097 --> 01:12:52,836
Any of those stories, like
a portion of those stories...

1017
01:12:52,869 --> 01:12:56,773
one of them maybe, you know,
but a few of them.

1018
01:12:56,806 --> 01:12:59,643
If in fact they're true...

1019
01:13:01,545 --> 01:13:04,013
you know, that doesn't push up
one's stock...

1020
01:13:04,047 --> 01:13:10,086
in terms of being in demand
to come in and be embraced
by a studio.

1021
01:13:10,119 --> 01:13:16,092
Back in school, it was a little
more obvious that it was a
created persona.

1022
01:13:16,125 --> 01:13:19,596
And it was built out
of his passion...

1023
01:13:19,629 --> 01:13:24,834
and it was built out of his
passion for samurai, for Teddy
Roosevelt...

1024
01:13:24,868 --> 01:13:28,171
for, you know, people he admired
and things he admired...

1025
01:13:28,204 --> 01:13:31,608
he constructed a character...

1026
01:13:31,641 --> 01:13:35,745
that embodied all the things
he admired and loved.

1027
01:13:35,779 --> 01:13:39,616
And that character is very
outrageous.

1028
01:13:39,649 --> 01:13:43,987
There are filmmakers, you know,
John Milius is one of them...

1029
01:13:44,020 --> 01:13:49,726
who have a kind of tough guy
front or bravado.

1030
01:13:49,759 --> 01:13:54,964
But it's partly show business
and they use this front,
who knows...

1031
01:13:54,998 --> 01:13:59,068
maybe to mask insecurities or
what have you, but it's an act.

1032
01:13:59,102 --> 01:14:05,609
And in this town, they don't
think like John thinks.

1033
01:14:05,642 --> 01:14:08,077
Less today than ever.

1034
01:14:22,592 --> 01:14:27,664
There's a danger in that whole
business of misunderstanding
of the situation.

1035
01:14:27,697 --> 01:14:36,072
Yes, it's a collaborative art,
yet usually one person winds up
with the credit and the blame.

1036
01:14:36,105 --> 01:14:38,775
The breaking point for me...

1037
01:14:38,808 --> 01:14:44,147
came when the Saturday Review
put out a cover.

1038
01:14:44,180 --> 01:14:49,218
Title of the cover was
The Brutalists.

1039
01:14:49,252 --> 01:14:53,990
And it was about the generation
of young men in Hollywood...

1040
01:14:54,023 --> 01:14:58,928
who were addicted to violence...

1041
01:14:58,962 --> 01:15:02,966
and I really wanted to get out
of that pigeon hole...

1042
01:15:02,999 --> 01:15:07,837
because I knew that once they
have you in that hole...

1043
01:15:07,871 --> 01:15:09,939
you don't ever get out...

1044
01:15:09,973 --> 01:15:12,776
and I don't think John ever got
out, and I think it did hurt
his career.

1045
01:15:14,243 --> 01:15:18,882
I think probably John
is his own worst enemy...

1046
01:15:18,915 --> 01:15:20,483
and I think
it's a different time.

1047
01:15:20,516 --> 01:15:24,921
You know, the people who could
make that transition from 70's
and you know...

1048
01:15:24,954 --> 01:15:28,792
even the early 80's where
it was a different kind
of filmmaking then.

1049
01:15:28,825 --> 01:15:31,060
It was the auteur.

1050
01:15:31,094 --> 01:15:33,930
And that kind of doesn't
suit well now...

1051
01:15:33,963 --> 01:15:38,167
in the kind of way that the
studio system's been taken over
by large corporations.

1052
01:15:38,201 --> 01:15:42,338
There is a pressure that goes
on being inside a corporation...

1053
01:15:42,371 --> 01:15:47,210
that is often about conformity
or, I'll say...

1054
01:15:47,243 --> 01:15:50,213
not wanting to risk one's job.

1055
01:15:50,246 --> 01:15:53,950
Um, which I think then sort
of forces the creative
process...

1056
01:15:53,983 --> 01:15:57,020
into a,
I think narrower window.

1057
01:15:57,053 --> 01:15:59,155
Because there's a lot more
marketing people...

1058
01:15:59,188 --> 01:16:02,592
that are running it today
than there were in those days.

1059
01:16:02,626 --> 01:16:06,029
He has a really unique voice
and for whatever reason...

1060
01:16:06,062 --> 01:16:09,165
it didn't get altered
by the process over time.

1061
01:16:09,198 --> 01:16:12,168
But you get this public persona
and it becomes a part of you.

1062
01:16:12,201 --> 01:16:17,206
I mean, whether you like it or
not, the way the world perceives
you creates a persona...

1063
01:16:17,240 --> 01:16:20,744
and that persona becomes real
in the media, in the outside
world...

1064
01:16:20,777 --> 01:16:25,815
and, you know, movies
and everything that's done
about you, books...

1065
01:16:25,849 --> 01:16:28,985
they use that persona rather
than the real deal.

1066
01:16:29,018 --> 01:16:32,288
I think that's the one place
where John shot himself
in the foot.

1067
01:16:32,321 --> 01:16:36,025
That should have been the time
when John grabbed everything.

1068
01:16:36,059 --> 01:16:38,628
We had just come off
of "Red Dawn"...

1069
01:16:38,662 --> 01:16:42,832
you know, the movie before
"Red Dawn" was "Conan".

1070
01:16:42,866 --> 01:16:45,034
It was very hard
to get him the work.

1071
01:16:45,068 --> 01:16:48,938
I've been blacklisted probably
since then, you know?

1072
01:16:48,972 --> 01:16:52,742
I've been blacklisted as surely
as anybody in the 50's.

1073
01:16:52,776 --> 01:16:57,013
I don't believe that much
in a blacklisting idea...

1074
01:16:57,046 --> 01:17:00,416
because I have been always out
there as a Republican.

1075
01:17:00,449 --> 01:17:04,187
They don't care if you're a
Libertarian, if you're an
independent...

1076
01:17:04,220 --> 01:17:08,291
if you decline to state if
you're Republican or Democrat,
that means nothing to Hollywood.

1077
01:17:08,324 --> 01:17:13,863
They don't care if you're...
if you're Lenin himself.

1078
01:17:13,897 --> 01:17:17,133
In Hollywood, the only thing
that means is money.

1079
01:17:17,166 --> 01:17:21,705
And whenever there's money
involved, you know, you're...

1080
01:17:21,738 --> 01:17:23,439
hand in hand with that is fear.

1081
01:17:23,472 --> 01:17:24,974
You know, so people are afraid
all the time...

1082
01:17:25,008 --> 01:17:30,346
and a guy like John that's a big
personality, you know, I'm sure
scares people.

1083
01:17:30,379 --> 01:17:33,883
It's funny that he would say
he'd been blacklisted...

1084
01:17:33,917 --> 01:17:38,254
because he came up in that
generation that finally changed
the way movies were made...

1085
01:17:38,287 --> 01:17:40,824
and movies were graded
by your success.

1086
01:17:42,125 --> 01:17:47,296
But if you say enough shit,
or do enough shit, as in the
case of Milius...

1087
01:17:47,330 --> 01:17:50,900
something...
you're bound to...

1088
01:17:50,934 --> 01:17:54,704
you're bound to pay at some
point on some level.

1089
01:17:54,738 --> 01:17:58,742
You know, if you go four years,
and it was...

1090
01:17:58,775 --> 01:18:01,778
"Farewell To the King",
I think, was 1990.

1091
01:18:01,811 --> 01:18:05,448
And so by the time a movie
like that comes out, that's...

1092
01:18:05,481 --> 01:18:09,018
gosh, that's six years
after "Red Dawn".

1093
01:18:09,052 --> 01:18:13,222
He showed a certain naivety...

1094
01:18:13,256 --> 01:18:16,926
which is also fundamental
to John Milius.

1095
01:18:16,960 --> 01:18:19,462
He doesn't realize that
in Hollywood...

1096
01:18:19,495 --> 01:18:22,732
executives with little talent
have long memories.

1097
01:18:23,967 --> 01:18:26,736
MILIUS (V.O.):
I've been very, very powerful
with my influence...

1098
01:18:26,770 --> 01:18:28,337
on the Revolutionary
Committee...

1099
01:18:28,371 --> 01:18:32,475
being that I'm the head
of the IWA, the International
Writers Army...

1100
01:18:32,508 --> 01:18:35,979
that are the terror arm of the
Writer's Guild, you know?

1101
01:18:36,012 --> 01:18:39,515
You know, and they have stopped
me in many of my projects...

1102
01:18:39,548 --> 01:18:44,087
one of which was to blow up
Jeff Katzenberg's car.
This is a symbol.

1103
01:18:45,254 --> 01:18:48,324
For a long time,
people would put up with John...

1104
01:18:48,357 --> 01:18:50,293
to get the screenplays
they wanted.

1105
01:18:51,961 --> 01:18:55,264
But when it came to "We had to
put up with all of this to get
the screenplay?"...

1106
01:18:55,298 --> 01:19:00,169
and we still haven't made the
movie, let's get rid of him as
the director.

1107
01:19:00,203 --> 01:19:05,374
And all those guys he came up
with, Lucas and Spielberg
and Randal Kleiser...

1108
01:19:05,408 --> 01:19:10,179
those guys, when they got to be
successful, they could kind of
write their own ticket.

1109
01:19:10,213 --> 01:19:12,515
And he chose not to be
those guys.

1110
01:19:12,548 --> 01:19:17,220
He chose to not make projects
that didn't interest him
as a filmmaker.

1111
01:19:17,253 --> 01:19:19,889
I think that's maybe where his
real purity lies.

1112
01:19:19,923 --> 01:19:22,091
As a writer,
he could do anything.

1113
01:19:22,125 --> 01:19:24,460
You have to be interested
in your work.

1114
01:19:24,493 --> 01:19:27,964
At a certain point, cashing a
paycheck is not what it's about.

1115
01:19:27,997 --> 01:19:31,968
ED O'NEILL (V.O.): I've read
scripts that John has written
that have never been done...

1116
01:19:32,001 --> 01:19:34,470
and I read one in particular
I'll never forget he wrote.

1117
01:19:34,503 --> 01:19:39,943
One about Texas Rangers, that
I think he kind of had an
earmark for Clint Eastwood...

1118
01:19:39,976 --> 01:19:42,411
when Eastwood would have been
perfect, you know?

1119
01:19:42,445 --> 01:19:47,216
You wonder how they wouldn't do
it, you know, when they do so
much shit.

1120
01:19:47,250 --> 01:19:48,918
Well, you know, like
Sean Connery, for example...

1121
01:19:48,952 --> 01:19:50,954
never did anything John didn't
rewrite his part.

1122
01:19:51,620 --> 01:19:55,291
I got a call and, "Mr. Neufeld?"

1123
01:19:55,324 --> 01:20:01,364
I said, "Yeah."
He said, "Sean Connery."

1124
01:20:01,397 --> 01:20:03,299
I said, "Why not?"

1125
01:20:03,332 --> 01:20:06,369
"There aren't enough big
speeches in this movie for me."

1126
01:20:06,402 --> 01:20:10,306
John was working in the office
right next to me and the door
was open...

1127
01:20:10,339 --> 01:20:16,379
and I quickly remembered that
John had done "The Wind and the
Lion" with Sean.

1128
01:20:17,947 --> 01:20:21,217
So, I said,
"Well, what about John Milius?"

1129
01:20:21,250 --> 01:20:24,187
He said, "Oh, he's great.
I love John, do you think
you can get him?"

1130
01:20:24,220 --> 01:20:27,590
I said, "Just a moment..."
and I put the phone on hold...

1131
01:20:27,623 --> 01:20:30,159
and I ran into the next office.

1132
01:20:30,193 --> 01:20:32,495
I said to John, "I've got Sean
Connery on the phone.

1133
01:20:32,528 --> 01:20:36,365
He's about ready to do
'The Hunt For Red October'...

1134
01:20:36,399 --> 01:20:38,334
but he says he needs
some big speeches."

1135
01:20:38,367 --> 01:20:40,236
John said,
"Well, I'm great at that."

1136
01:20:40,269 --> 01:20:45,341
Once more, we play
our dangerous game...

1137
01:20:45,374 --> 01:20:51,180
a game of chess, against our old
adversary, the American Navy.

1138
01:20:51,214 --> 01:20:57,887
Basically John saved me on
"The Hunt For Red October".

1139
01:20:57,921 --> 01:21:02,291
It became easy to not call him,
except finally to do those
rewrites, you know...

1140
01:21:02,325 --> 01:21:05,228
and you could make a very good
living doing that...

1141
01:21:05,261 --> 01:21:07,063
but he couldn't be that
person as a director.

1142
01:21:07,096 --> 01:21:11,467
It had to mean something to him,
because he knew about the
toil...

1143
01:21:11,500 --> 01:21:15,271
and the sum total of blood,
sweat and effort...

1144
01:21:15,304 --> 01:21:16,973
it demanded to get a movie made.

1145
01:21:17,006 --> 01:21:19,375
He just couldn't divorce
himself from that.

1146
01:21:19,408 --> 01:21:21,577
He had to be the guy
who committed.

1147
01:21:21,610 --> 01:21:25,481
He wasn't satisfied with just
writing. He wanted to direct.

1148
01:21:25,514 --> 01:21:32,221
And in between "Red Dawn", um,
until the current...

1149
01:21:32,255 --> 01:21:35,959
until now is really
"Flight of the Intruder"
and "Rough Riders"...

1150
01:21:35,992 --> 01:21:41,430
I think are two over a 20...
that's something like a 20-year
period.

1151
01:21:41,464 --> 01:21:45,301
And I always find myself
wondering, too, if,
during those rewrites...

1152
01:21:45,334 --> 01:21:48,671
it took up so much of his time
that by the time he got ready to
make another movie...

1153
01:21:48,704 --> 01:21:50,506
his moment had passed.

1154
01:22:00,349 --> 01:22:03,219
ETHAN MILIUS (V.O.):
Chuck Reedy was a close
friend of my father's.

1155
01:22:03,252 --> 01:22:06,589
He was also, at the same time,
my dad's accountant.

1156
01:22:06,622 --> 01:22:09,225
If you were to characterize
somebody as a best friend...

1157
01:22:09,258 --> 01:22:11,494
Chuck Reedy would have been
my dad's best friend.

1158
01:22:11,527 --> 01:22:15,298
There was something seedy
about him and you could see
it from a mile away.

1159
01:22:15,331 --> 01:22:17,366
Unfortunately my dad
couldn't.

1160
01:22:17,400 --> 01:22:22,305
My dad discovered that Chuck
was essentially...

1161
01:22:22,338 --> 01:22:24,673
stealing money from my dad.

1162
01:22:24,707 --> 01:22:28,244
He was about the worst
I've ever seen him.

1163
01:22:28,277 --> 01:22:30,479
He had lost a substantial
amount of money.

1164
01:22:30,513 --> 01:22:35,151
I don't think that he thought
that he'd ever be able to earn
back the money again.

1165
01:22:35,184 --> 01:22:38,487
That absolutely crushed my dad.

1166
01:22:40,789 --> 01:22:44,593
I was at dinner with John,
all was not well...

1167
01:22:44,627 --> 01:22:47,396
and the subject of the
conversation...

1168
01:22:47,430 --> 01:22:54,370
was about John wanting
to write on "Deadwood".

1169
01:22:55,671 --> 01:23:02,678
John was trying to get on as
a staff writer with David Milch,
and David Milch said...

1170
01:23:02,711 --> 01:23:08,484
"I'm not doing it. I can't...
you're not a staff writer.

1171
01:23:08,517 --> 01:23:10,753
You wrote 'Apocalypse Now'.

1172
01:23:10,786 --> 01:23:15,324
I couldn't walk in the office
and see you in there with the
fucking staff writers".

1173
01:23:15,358 --> 01:23:20,329
And John said,
"My son's going to law school."

1174
01:23:20,363 --> 01:23:25,101
And he had basically committed
to paying for law school...

1175
01:23:25,134 --> 01:23:30,106
and then decommitted
and said, "I can't afford it,
I can't do it."

1176
01:23:30,139 --> 01:23:35,078
"And I can't afford to send him
there. I can't get arrested."

1177
01:23:35,111 --> 01:23:37,746
You know, he laid it out,
"I'm broke."

1178
01:23:37,780 --> 01:23:42,185
And Milch said,
"I'll pay for his law school."

1179
01:23:42,218 --> 01:23:46,055
And John says, "It's three
years, are you fucking crazy?"
He said, "No, I'll do it."

1180
01:23:46,089 --> 01:23:50,393
And then he said something along
the lines of, I have a friend
who has scholarships.

1181
01:23:51,760 --> 01:23:56,132
Here's the kicker. I was having
lunch with David Milch.

1182
01:23:56,165 --> 01:24:01,637
And he came in and said, "Would
you believe this? This fucking
crazy Milius paid me back?"

1183
01:24:01,670 --> 01:24:06,375
He said, "He's the first
motherfucker that ever paid me
back in my life."

1184
01:24:06,409 --> 01:24:09,712
When John did "Rome",
John paid him back.

1185
01:24:13,716 --> 01:24:15,351
OLIVER STONE (V.O.):
But he hadn't directed
anything...

1186
01:24:15,384 --> 01:24:18,854
since "Flight of the Intruder"
and "Rough Riders".

1187
01:24:18,887 --> 01:24:21,324
So I think he's now working
on "Genghis Khan"...

1188
01:24:21,357 --> 01:24:27,363
which he's been working on,
this opus he's wanted to tell
for, my god, 20 years.

1189
01:24:27,396 --> 01:24:30,466
John and I actually hadn't
spoken for a number of years...

1190
01:24:30,499 --> 01:24:33,702
because we had had a
disagreement at the end
of "Farewell To the King".

1191
01:24:33,736 --> 01:24:37,072
It wasn't until "Genghis Khan"
came along that we got back
in business.

1192
01:24:40,609 --> 01:24:43,246
And when we sat down
to talk about
"Genghis Khan"...

1193
01:24:43,279 --> 01:24:46,515
we shared the same idea that
this could be both a great
film...

1194
01:24:46,549 --> 01:24:51,120
and a fitting re-entry
for John Milius...

1195
01:24:51,154 --> 01:24:55,158
both as the director of the film
and the screenwriter.

1196
01:24:56,292 --> 01:25:01,597
And the more that John got into
what it must have been like
for Genghis Khan...

1197
01:25:01,630 --> 01:25:05,768
to have conquered the known
world, the more we became taken
with the whole idea...

1198
01:25:05,801 --> 01:25:10,306
that this is one of those great
untold stories of history.

1199
01:25:10,339 --> 01:25:15,844
It's kind of the culmination of
a lot of the themes that I think
that he's written about.

1200
01:25:15,878 --> 01:25:19,148
There's something when a
creative person has an idea...

1201
01:25:19,182 --> 01:25:22,385
and it is, you know...

1202
01:25:22,418 --> 01:25:25,454
they've become in love with it
and it lives within them.

1203
01:25:25,488 --> 01:25:29,525
And that's what he had,
he was just amazingly involved
in it.

1204
01:25:29,558 --> 01:25:33,262
It was his passion.
He wanted to make this movie.

1205
01:25:33,296 --> 01:25:36,532
The only director that could
have been better than
John Milius...

1206
01:25:36,565 --> 01:25:39,635
to direct "Genghis Khan" would
have been Attila the Hun.

1207
01:25:39,668 --> 01:25:42,505
And since he's dead,
it goes to Milius.

1208
01:25:42,538 --> 01:25:47,376
But if it's going to be Milius
directing John Milius'
"Genghis Khan"...

1209
01:25:47,410 --> 01:25:51,214
audiences are expecting
a little bit of rape...

1210
01:25:51,247 --> 01:25:53,416
a little bit of pillage.

1211
01:25:55,851 --> 01:26:00,589
Great characters facing
great moral dilemmas.

1212
01:26:01,824 --> 01:26:06,329
John said, "You're right,
then you have to let me write
the second draft."

1213
01:26:14,237 --> 01:26:17,240
JOHN PLASTER (V.O.):
I'd been with John
in New York for three days.

1214
01:26:17,273 --> 01:26:22,945
Doing research was always fun
with John, because it was
interesting research for me.

1215
01:26:22,978 --> 01:26:26,815
We were going out to dinner
and it's just a continuing
conversation.

1216
01:26:26,849 --> 01:26:30,253
We're walking down stairs
to his car...

1217
01:26:30,286 --> 01:26:34,357
and in mid-step John stops
talking...

1218
01:26:34,390 --> 01:26:36,292
and I'd just asked him
a question.

1219
01:26:36,492 --> 01:26:40,929
And I asked him again,
"John, what do you think
about this scene?"

1220
01:26:40,963 --> 01:26:43,232
He didn't say anything.

1221
01:26:43,266 --> 01:26:45,801
I knew something was wrong,
I immediately got in front
of him...

1222
01:26:45,834 --> 01:26:48,504
and I looked into his face...

1223
01:26:48,537 --> 01:26:52,608
and he was disoriented
and he was twitching
on one side of his face.

1224
01:26:52,641 --> 01:26:55,978
Well, I knew right away
that it was a stroke.

1225
01:26:57,980 --> 01:27:01,317
So I was calling 911
as I was shaking him
and keeping him awake.

1226
01:27:01,350 --> 01:27:03,952
And again,
by the grace of God...

1227
01:27:03,986 --> 01:27:09,292
there just happened to be an
ambulance only... not even
ten minutes away.

1228
01:27:11,694 --> 01:27:13,962
ETHAN MILIUS (V.O.):
And then I remember getting
the phone call...

1229
01:27:13,996 --> 01:27:16,432
hearing that my dad
had a stroke.

1230
01:27:17,833 --> 01:27:22,771
I went into the hospital room
and he was in the ICU.

1231
01:27:22,805 --> 01:27:26,942
He was sitting in that room and
it was absolutely horrendous.

1232
01:27:26,975 --> 01:27:33,749
To see your dad, who is never
at a loss for words, and there
was no communication at all.

1233
01:27:33,782 --> 01:27:38,053
And we weren't sure, like,
if you know, if he was going
to have any brain functioning.

1234
01:27:38,086 --> 01:27:43,792
And he wasn't communicating,
so we had no idea what was
going to happen.

1235
01:27:43,826 --> 01:27:48,331
Everything I've ever talked to
you about is about his
communicating, his storytelling.

1236
01:27:48,564 --> 01:27:52,735
That's how people know him.
He's a guy who likes talking
and now he can't.

1237
01:27:56,639 --> 01:28:01,844
I can't think of a...

1238
01:28:01,877 --> 01:28:04,947
I can't think
of a worse thing...

1239
01:28:04,980 --> 01:28:08,584
ever happening to a person
who I knew.

1240
01:28:10,819 --> 01:28:14,857
And I'm talking about beyond
people who have died
before their time.

1241
01:28:15,958 --> 01:28:22,331
But I'm talking about a
raconteur, one of the greatest
raconteurs of my generation...

1242
01:28:22,565 --> 01:28:25,568
losing the ability to speak.

1243
01:28:28,904 --> 01:28:31,540
It's the worst thing that's ever
happened to any of my friends.

1244
01:28:33,876 --> 01:28:38,547
I think I had my iPhone with me,
and I would play music
for him...

1245
01:28:38,581 --> 01:28:45,053
and around that time,
I had gotten some of the music
from "Conan".

1246
01:28:45,087 --> 01:28:48,323
( THEME FROM "CONAN" PLAYING )

1247
01:28:49,725 --> 01:28:54,397
I had played that, you know,
because I thought something
he could recognize...

1248
01:28:54,430 --> 01:28:58,333
and I started seeing a reaction.

1249
01:28:59,835 --> 01:29:03,606
And that was the first time he'd
really communicated with anyone.

1250
01:29:03,639 --> 01:29:07,943
It was awesome. It was like he's
going to... you know, this...

1251
01:29:07,976 --> 01:29:09,812
it's not as bad as it could be.

1252
01:29:09,845 --> 01:29:13,749
And slowly he made, you know...

1253
01:29:13,782 --> 01:29:16,819
slight, incremental increases
in his ability.

1254
01:29:16,852 --> 01:29:19,688
After the stroke,
we stopped everything.

1255
01:29:19,722 --> 01:29:25,494
In November of... what are we
now? 2011?

1256
01:29:25,528 --> 01:29:29,432
November of 2010, John moved
back to the West Coast...

1257
01:29:29,465 --> 01:29:32,735
to start his physiotherapy
and his speech therapy.

to go back to... there.

all the...

1263
01:29:46,582 --> 01:29:52,154
He's had physical therapy, um,
he's had speech therapy and
occupational therapy.

01:29:52,555 --> 01:29:53,856

want to type?

Where's your thing?

And you can see, just by sitting
there and you talk to him...

1272
01:30:20,015 --> 01:30:22,818
and you can see the frustration
is there, he's...

01:30:22,851 --> 01:30:26,855
the words are all in there,
they just can't come out.

must had to be.

Incrementally, it's quite easy
for me to see the progress...

1276
01:30:32,928 --> 01:30:37,065
he's making, but I'm not living
it on the day-by-day basis.

1277
01:30:37,099 --> 01:30:42,137
And I know, from when
I'm here, part of his
frustration is...

1278
01:30:42,170 --> 01:30:45,974
he has the thought,
he can't articulate it.

1280

I think he absolutely
is progressing and he's able
to communicate his ideas...

1281
01:30:57,886 --> 01:31:01,924
and he's got a tablet
that he writes on.

You know, by filling
in certain points...

1283

you can actually have
a conversation.

Okay, yeah. See?

01:31:16,539 --> 01:31:19,141
You need to spend more time
with me, man. I speak John.

1288
01:31:19,174 --> 01:31:24,780
You know, so I'm very confident
that he will get there...

1289
01:31:24,813 --> 01:31:27,149
but it's a journey
of 1,000 miles.

1290

And it's every day,
heavy lifting.

He's coming back.
He's working really hard.

Okay, yes! Yeah, oh, no.
Oh, no!

1293

But when you get in a room
with John, he's still John...

1294
01:31:45,300 --> 01:31:47,603
his laugh hasn't changed.

1295
01:31:47,636 --> 01:31:51,740
His ability to express a joke...

1296
01:31:51,774 --> 01:31:55,010
not even in words anymore,
but his ability to get you
to laugh hasn't changed...

1297
01:31:55,043 --> 01:31:57,946
and he still fills the room
with his presence.

1298

He clearly is not where
he was before...

strides in terms of his ability
to communicate...

and clearly understands
everything that's going around
him.

1301
01:32:30,846 --> 01:32:35,283
John was very distraught,
because as you probably know...

1302
01:32:35,317 --> 01:32:42,591
shooting has been an integral
part of his life for many years.

of concentration,
eye-hand coordination.

John couldn't grasp the gun
properly...

1306
01:33:02,210 --> 01:33:07,049
I put it in his hand,
wrapped his hand around it,
put the gun up.

very disappointed.

on his face...

He remembered all of the things
we had talked about.

As of five weeks ago,
when I saw him last...

1326
01:34:37,105 --> 01:34:40,242
he had finished going
through "Genghis Khan"...

excess dialogue.

partner as a producer
on the film?

He clearly continues to want
to see that, maybe not
directing it himself.

enough to where he's telling

01:40:35,397 --> 01:40:41,236
and develop the concept for how
should we create the arena...

1381
01:40:41,269 --> 01:40:45,507
where the guys could go and
fight without giving the
competitor...

1382
01:40:45,540 --> 01:40:47,575
the opportunity to run away.

1383
01:40:47,609 --> 01:40:50,578
So John would say,
"What about a moat with
alligators or sharks...

1384
01:40:50,612 --> 01:40:52,580
or an electric fence
or something like that, you
know?"

1385
01:40:56,551 --> 01:40:59,287
I says John, come on
and write an episode,
it was a phone call.

1386
01:40:59,321 --> 01:41:00,722
Come up and write an episode.

1387
01:41:00,755 --> 01:41:03,658
"Great, I got something I want
to do." Called "Viking Bikers
From Hell".

1388
01:41:03,691 --> 01:41:06,294
So I bought it
on the title alone.

1389
01:41:17,405 --> 01:41:20,475
A lot of the seminal directors
of my childhood...

1390
01:41:20,508 --> 01:41:24,512
at least the commercially
successful ones, site it
as their inspiration.

1391
01:41:24,546 --> 01:41:29,484
You know John made a lot of
careers through his screenplays.

1392
01:41:29,517 --> 01:41:33,721
The amazing body of work the guy
has created, and at the end
of the day...

1393
01:41:33,755 --> 01:41:38,160
if somebody asked me to describe
who the dude was, I'd say he was
a storyteller.

1394
01:41:52,274 --> 01:41:56,544
I had lunch with Steven and
George once, we were just
talking about the past...

1395
01:41:56,578 --> 01:42:01,716
and they told me that they all
swapped points on three
movies...

1396
01:42:01,749 --> 01:42:04,819
"Star Wars", "Big Wednesday" and
"Close Encounters".

1397
01:42:04,852 --> 01:42:08,323
And Steven says, "I'm still
seeing money from "Star Wars".

1398
01:42:08,356 --> 01:42:11,393
And Lucas is like, "Yeah,
whatever happened to our
'Big Wednesday' money?"

1399
01:42:11,426 --> 01:42:14,662
Think about it. Three guys
swapping their gross points.

1400
01:42:14,696 --> 01:42:18,933
Who does that now? I mean,
it's hard enough to get any
gross points.

1401
01:42:18,966 --> 01:42:22,870
You can imagine what
it was like back then.

1402
01:42:32,814 --> 01:42:38,720
And when he hired us to do
"1941", he says, "You need guns,
boys! You need guns!"

1403
01:42:38,753 --> 01:42:41,923
John gave us each Colt .45
automatics.

1404
01:42:41,956 --> 01:42:43,891
John says, "I know, we need
to go over to Francis' house.

1405
01:42:43,925 --> 01:42:47,595
And I remember Francis
was making pizza.

1406
01:42:47,629 --> 01:42:54,402
And Coppola is just outraged,
"John , what are you doing?
This is terrible."

1407
01:42:54,436 --> 01:42:58,340
He says, "Look, I'm making
pizza, this gives life."

1408
01:42:59,574 --> 01:43:02,377
He said,
"Guns symbolize death."

1409
01:43:02,410 --> 01:43:04,312
I don't recall that moment,
no doubt John wrote it.

1410
01:43:28,470 --> 01:43:31,239
Pretty good
at making shit up, huh?

1411
01:43:31,273 --> 01:43:32,874
MAN (O.C.):
That's awesome.
