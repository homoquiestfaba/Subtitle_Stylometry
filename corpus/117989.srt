<i>¤¤And starry skies ¤¤¤¤</i>

20
00:02:09,796 --> 00:02:13,732
- Look after your carriage, mister.
- Oh, please, sir! Please!

21
00:02:15,368 --> 00:02:19,270
Is this your daughter, madame?

22
00:02:19,339 --> 00:02:23,833
I will take her, half cash down
and half in consuls.

23
00:02:25,912 --> 00:02:29,404
Surely, Mama, you cannot sell me
to the highest bidder, though he is a lord.

24
00:02:29,482 --> 00:02:31,416
Why ever not, child?

25
00:02:31,484 --> 00:02:34,419
We cannot flout the rules
of good society.

26
00:02:52,572 --> 00:02:56,702
Mind your backs. Excuse us.

27
00:02:56,776 --> 00:02:58,710
<i>You can catch a lord
with 30,000...</i>

28
00:03:02,081 --> 00:03:04,276
Is this an inconvenient moment?

29
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:07,751
I've returned for another look, Mr. Sharp,
but I can always come back another time.

30
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:11,620
<i>No need, my lord.
There it is.</i>

31
00:03:11,691 --> 00:03:14,387
<i>Virtue Betrayed.</i>

32
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:18,055
Look.
Look as long as you want.

33
00:03:28,274 --> 00:03:31,209
- And the price?
- Four guineas, my lord. Just as I said.

34
00:03:31,277 --> 00:03:33,336
They're all four guineas.

35
00:03:33,413 --> 00:03:36,712
Not that one!
That one is 10!

36
00:03:36,783 --> 00:03:38,717
<i>Virtue Betrayed is 10 guineas.</i>

37
00:03:38,785 --> 00:03:42,744
- Oh, but that is too much, little miss.
- Good.

38
00:03:42,822 --> 00:03:46,986
The model was my late wife.
The child doesn't want to part with it.

39
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:49,119
And if I give you 10 guineas
for this picture of your mother,

40
00:03:49,195 --> 00:03:51,663
will you be happy then
to see it go?

41
00:03:51,731 --> 00:03:56,430
No.
But it will be too much to refuse.

42
00:03:56,502 --> 00:04:00,029
Hmph. Very well then.

43
00:04:00,106 --> 00:04:03,132
Ten guineas it shall be.

44
00:04:03,209 --> 00:04:06,838
Mark!

45
00:04:15,755 --> 00:04:18,246
<i>I'm very much obliged, sir.</i>

46
00:04:18,324 --> 00:04:21,350
<i>- Good day to you, Mr. Sharp.
- Good day, my lord.</i>

47
00:04:31,671 --> 00:04:36,472
The orphanage can take her,
but I thought you might find her useful.

48
00:04:36,542 --> 00:04:40,444
With both parents dead,
there's no one to fuss.

49
00:04:40,513 --> 00:04:44,347
You can...
do what you like with the child.

50
00:04:44,417 --> 00:04:47,352
Hmm.
How fluent is her French?

51
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:50,753
Oh, very.
Her mother was Parisian.

52
00:04:50,823 --> 00:04:52,757
An opera girl.

53
00:04:52,825 --> 00:04:55,521
I see.

54
00:04:55,595 --> 00:04:58,496
Well, the less said
about that the better.

55
00:05:18,651 --> 00:05:22,485
Good-bye, Miss Sedley.
You are a credit to us.

56
00:05:22,555 --> 00:05:26,548
Take this copy of the great
Dr. Johnson's dictionary
as a token of our good wishes.

57
00:05:26,626 --> 00:05:30,585
Thank you,
Miss Pinkerton.

58
00:05:30,663 --> 00:05:32,995
You've tidied the library?
Yes, Miss Green.

59
00:05:33,066 --> 00:05:35,000
And the sheet music?
It's all put away?

60
00:05:35,068 --> 00:05:37,036
Yes, it is,
Miss Green.
Well, what about the study hall?

61
00:05:37,103 --> 00:05:40,300
Have you swept it
thoroughly?
I have and for the last time.

62
00:05:40,373 --> 00:05:42,341
Don't be too sure, Miss Sharp.

63
00:05:42,408 --> 00:05:44,501
Life can be very unpredictable.

64
00:05:44,577 --> 00:05:47,205
Oh, I do hope so,
Miss Green.

65
00:05:59,959 --> 00:06:02,359
<i>Miss Sharp,
I can't pretend to understand...</i>

66
00:06:02,428 --> 00:06:05,522
why you prefer the post
of a country governess
to your position here.

67
00:06:05,598 --> 00:06:09,591
- Can you not, Miss Pinkerton?
- And you feel quite ready to leave us?

68
00:06:13,773 --> 00:06:17,038
I'm glad to hear it.
Then good day to you,
Miss Sharp.

69
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:19,305
Good day.

70
00:06:29,322 --> 00:06:32,086
Oh, Miss Pinkerton?

71
00:06:32,158 --> 00:06:35,286
Am I not to have
myJohnson's dictionary?

72
00:06:35,361 --> 00:06:37,386
Very well.
Here you are.

73
00:06:37,463 --> 00:06:40,057
Treat it as a symbol of the education
we have given you.

74
00:06:40,133 --> 00:06:42,294
I certainly will,
Miss Pinkerton.

75
00:06:43,336 --> 00:06:45,167
<i>Bye.!</i>

76
00:06:54,947 --> 00:06:58,974
<i>Silly old trout.
She doesn't know a word of French,
though she's too proud to admit it.</i>

77
00:06:59,051 --> 00:07:01,576
<i>Vive la France.!</i>

78
00:07:01,654 --> 00:07:03,679
Vive Napoleon!

79
00:07:03,756 --> 00:07:05,781
Becky, how can you be
so wicked and vengeful?

80
00:07:05,858 --> 00:07:08,349
<i>And why not?
In all the years I spent there,</i>

81
00:07:08,428 --> 00:07:10,362
I only ever knew
kind words from you.

82
00:07:11,531 --> 00:07:14,329
<i>Revenge may be wicked,
but it's perfectly natural.</i>

83
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:17,836
<i>Perhaps it is.
But you're wrong to make me say so.</i>

84
00:07:17,904 --> 00:07:22,307
<i>Never mind that.
Let's talk ofhow I'm to spend
my precious week of freedom.</i>

85
00:07:22,375 --> 00:07:25,435
My first priority
is to form an opinion
of Captain Osborne.

86
00:07:25,511 --> 00:07:27,945
<i>I take that duty
very seriously, you know.</i>

87
00:07:28,014 --> 00:07:31,074
It will not tax you.
George is quite perfect.

88
00:07:31,150 --> 00:07:34,677
<i>- And so he should be. And your parents?
- Get on there.!</i>

89
00:07:34,754 --> 00:07:36,722
I must confess
I'm a little nervous of them.

90
00:07:36,789 --> 00:07:39,553
Just be yourself
and everyone will love you.
I do.

91
00:07:39,625 --> 00:07:42,458
- Tell me more about your brother.
- Jos?

92
00:07:42,528 --> 00:07:46,362
There's nothing to add
to what you already know.

93
00:07:46,432 --> 00:07:50,198
He's home on leave from India.
The position is a fine one.

94
00:07:50,269 --> 00:07:53,136
<i>It has made him rich.</i>

95
00:07:53,206 --> 00:07:56,767
But I'm afraid his life is a lonely one.

96
00:07:56,843 --> 00:07:59,676
If only he were married.

97
00:08:05,251 --> 00:08:08,049
Come on! Get up!

98
00:08:12,091 --> 00:08:14,582
And what children exactly...

99
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:17,254
are to have the benefit of
your instruction, Miss Sharp?

100
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:20,094
The daughters of Sir Pitt Crawley
of Queen's Crawley, ma'am.

101
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:23,067
<i>He's among the first
gentlemen of Hampshire.</i>

102
00:08:23,135 --> 00:08:25,365
<i>Or so I was told
when I applied for the position.</i>

103
00:08:25,438 --> 00:08:30,239
Mmm.
He is not so prominent that
we have ever heard of him.

104
00:08:31,611 --> 00:08:33,670
Do you know the county at all?
No.

105
00:08:33,746 --> 00:08:37,375
But that does not frighten me.
I love to visit new places.

106
00:08:37,450 --> 00:08:40,886
- Really?
- Oh, indeed!

107
00:08:40,953 --> 00:08:44,218
How I envy men who can explore for
themselves all the wonders of the world.

108
00:08:46,459 --> 00:08:50,122
<i>And, uh, should you like
to visit India, do you think?</i>

109
00:08:50,196 --> 00:08:54,758
<i>India?
I cannot think of anywhere
I'd rather see.</i>

110
00:08:54,834 --> 00:08:59,737
The palaces of Delhi,
the Taj Mahal,
the Burning Ghats...

111
00:08:59,805 --> 00:09:01,932
Have you made a study
of India, Miss Sharp?

112
00:09:02,008 --> 00:09:04,704
<i>Not so much
as I would like.</i>

113
00:09:04,777 --> 00:09:08,770
I'm enraptured with every scent
and flavor of the East.

114
00:09:08,848 --> 00:09:10,907
Oh, gad, if you think so.

115
00:09:10,983 --> 00:09:14,043
Biju, fetch a plate.

116
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:30,464
<i>Becky, be careful.!
Those curries can burn.!</i>

117
00:09:50,723 --> 00:09:55,422
So, Miss Sharp, how do you
find your first taste of India?

118
00:09:55,494 --> 00:09:57,962
Delicious.

119
00:10:08,107 --> 00:10:10,769
¤ Over the mountains ¤

120
00:10:10,843 --> 00:10:14,108
¤ And over the waves ¤

121
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:17,513
<i>¤¤ Under the fountains ¤¤</i>

122
00:10:17,583 --> 00:10:20,143
<i>¤¤And under the graves ¤¤</i>

123
00:10:20,219 --> 00:10:23,677
¤ Under floods
that are deepest ¤

124
00:10:23,756 --> 00:10:26,919
¤ Which Neptune obey ¤

125
00:10:26,993 --> 00:10:30,793
¤ Over rocks that are steepest ¤

126
00:10:30,863 --> 00:10:33,297
<i>¤¤Love will find out ¤¤</i>

127
00:10:33,366 --> 00:10:37,302
<i>¤¤ The way ¤¤¤¤</i>

128
00:10:41,273 --> 00:10:43,207
My word, Miss Sharp.

129
00:10:43,275 --> 00:10:45,505
You've the voice of an angel
in heaven.

130
00:10:45,578 --> 00:10:47,705
<i>Oh.
Yes.</i>

131
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:50,806
You must have some lessons,
my dear.

132
00:10:50,883 --> 00:10:53,113
Captain Dobbin!

133
00:10:54,654 --> 00:10:57,452
Is George not here?
Yes.
Where is my dear godson?

134
00:10:57,523 --> 00:11:00,822
Pray don't concern yourselves.
George sends his regrets.

135
00:11:00,893 --> 00:11:04,795
<i>- Work holds him prisoner.
- But he is coming to the picnic
at Vauxhall tomorrow?</i>

136
00:11:04,864 --> 00:11:09,028
- Do please say that he is.
- Oh, he wouldn't miss it for worlds.

137
00:11:17,276 --> 00:11:19,710
Come to bed, now.

138
00:11:19,779 --> 00:11:23,340
You must be finished
with all those boring
old numbers.

139
00:11:23,416 --> 00:11:25,543
If only I could be.

140
00:11:27,053 --> 00:11:31,786
I wish Jos wasn't
taking her to this silly
Vauxhall picnic.

141
00:11:31,857 --> 00:11:36,794
He'll drink too much,
and who knows what he'll say
if the little minx works on him.

142
00:11:36,862 --> 00:11:41,424
LetJos marry whom he likes.
She has no fortune,
but nor had you.

143
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:45,960
<i>Better her than a black
Mrs. Sedley from Boggley Wollah...</i>

144
00:11:46,038 --> 00:11:49,974
and her dozen
mahogany grandchildren.
Now, now, now.

145
00:12:04,790 --> 00:12:09,193
George,
your Amelia awaits.

146
00:12:11,097 --> 00:12:14,089
Ho-hum, Dobbs.

147
00:12:14,166 --> 00:12:18,398
Unflagging devotion is all very well,
but it does rather take out the challenge.

148
00:12:19,505 --> 00:12:23,339
So tell me, what is
the hanger-on governess like?

149
00:12:27,346 --> 00:12:30,440
Amelia.
Miss Sharp.
Thank you.

150
00:12:30,516 --> 00:12:32,643
Step carefully now.

151
00:12:35,755 --> 00:12:40,158
<i>And here he is. It's George.</i>

152
00:12:40,226 --> 00:12:44,526
My dear Amelia.
I can't tell you how much Becky
has been longing to meet you.

153
00:12:44,597 --> 00:12:47,361
<i>I want to be quite sure you're
good enough for dear Amelia.</i>

154
00:12:48,434 --> 00:12:51,597
And who's to decide? You?

155
00:12:53,939 --> 00:12:56,464
Oh, but, Becky only meant...

156
00:12:56,542 --> 00:12:59,033
Come, Miss Becky.

157
00:12:59,111 --> 00:13:03,480
May I show you the pavilion
and all the delights I've prepared for us?

158
00:13:03,549 --> 00:13:06,109
You may show me anything
you choose, Mr. Sedley.

159
00:13:12,091 --> 00:13:16,551
She was only joking.
I don't care for governesses
to joke at my expense.

160
00:13:31,076 --> 00:13:34,239
Miss Sharp! Miss Sharp!

161
00:13:34,313 --> 00:13:37,908
I thought I was to help unravel your silks,
not to be sold into slavery.

162
00:13:37,983 --> 00:13:39,917
Nonsense, Mr. Sedley.

163
00:13:39,985 --> 00:13:43,148
Stay still, I beg you,
or I shall never have
them untangled.

164
00:13:43,222 --> 00:13:45,713
I surrender.

165
00:13:45,791 --> 00:13:48,419
I am your prisoner.

166
00:13:50,229 --> 00:13:54,825
You have only to ask
and I shall release you.

167
00:13:55,868 --> 00:13:59,167
But...
why would I ever want that?

168
00:13:59,238 --> 00:14:01,570
Hmm.

169
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:04,507
I hopeJos isn't
getting in too deep.

170
00:14:04,577 --> 00:14:07,171
Becky is my friend,
dearest George.

171
00:14:09,148 --> 00:14:12,311
And I would welcome her
as a sister, as I hope you would.

172
00:14:13,719 --> 00:14:16,620
<i>Biju, we're ready.
Hmm.</i>

173
00:14:29,068 --> 00:14:33,232
Dearest Miss Sharp,
I give him to you.

174
00:14:34,573 --> 00:14:36,803
What?
Your beautiful bird?

175
00:14:36,876 --> 00:14:38,810
No, I couldn't!

176
00:14:38,878 --> 00:14:41,472
You say you love everything
that comes from India.

177
00:14:42,548 --> 00:14:44,743
Take him.

178
00:14:44,817 --> 00:14:48,548
He is my ambassador.

179
00:14:51,290 --> 00:14:54,054
Hello.

180
00:15:09,441 --> 00:15:12,035
Amelia!

181
00:15:12,111 --> 00:15:14,170
Well?

182
00:15:14,246 --> 00:15:17,511
He called me "dearest" twice,
and he squeezed my hand.

183
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:20,416
And look.
He gave me his precious bird.

184
00:15:20,486 --> 00:15:23,944
- Well, surely that is a good sign.
- I know! I know!

185
00:15:25,324 --> 00:15:27,952
Feel my heart,
how it beats.

186
00:15:28,027 --> 00:15:32,088
What are you playing at
with the little governess?

187
00:15:32,164 --> 00:15:35,964
- Well, I told her I was...
- Jos. Jos.

188
00:15:36,035 --> 00:15:39,163
You've forgotten
how these things work.

189
00:15:39,238 --> 00:15:41,331
Do you think the fellas
down at the club...

190
00:15:41,407 --> 00:15:44,308
would let their wives
dine with a governess?

191
00:15:45,678 --> 00:15:51,548
Seriously, Jos,
if I'm to marry your sister...

192
00:15:52,618 --> 00:15:54,483
lf?

193
00:15:54,553 --> 00:15:57,886
<i>What are they talking about?
Can you guess?</i>

194
00:15:59,692 --> 00:16:03,685
Yes.
I think I probably can.

195
00:16:20,746 --> 00:16:23,806
Oh, Becky, who knows?

196
00:16:23,882 --> 00:16:26,578
It might turn out to be
a blessing in disguise.

197
00:16:26,652 --> 00:16:28,984
The disguise
is very convincing.

198
00:16:31,623 --> 00:16:33,921
Good luck.

199
00:16:34,994 --> 00:16:38,862
Here. This is for you.

200
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:43,527
Oh.
It's one of my father's.

201
00:16:43,602 --> 00:16:46,366
I've nothing else to give.

202
00:16:46,438 --> 00:16:50,272
Oh, I couldn't.
Take it.

203
00:16:50,342 --> 00:16:52,640
I want you to have it.

204
00:16:52,711 --> 00:16:55,077
At least I know
it will be safe with you.

205
00:16:58,751 --> 00:17:01,049
Oh, Becky!

206
00:17:03,822 --> 00:17:06,814
<i>Good stuff! Inside!</i>

207
00:17:06,892 --> 00:17:09,520
Off I go then.

208
00:17:09,595 --> 00:17:12,758
Couldn't I pay for a seat inside?

209
00:17:12,831 --> 00:17:16,733
They're all taken.
But don't worry.
I prefer the open air.

210
00:17:16,802 --> 00:17:20,431
<i>Hello, madame.
Hurry along now.!</i>

211
00:17:23,208 --> 00:17:25,142
Bye!

212
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:28,873
<i>Get it on there.!</i>

213
00:17:56,442 --> 00:17:58,637
<i>Queen's Crawley.!</i>

214
00:18:56,869 --> 00:18:58,860
Yes?

215
00:19:00,506 --> 00:19:03,100
Can you tell Sir Pitt Crawley
that Miss Sharp has arrived.

216
00:19:03,175 --> 00:19:05,200
And bring in my trunk
if you please.

217
00:19:05,277 --> 00:19:08,940
- Miss Sharp?
- Yes, Miss Rebecca Sharp.

218
00:19:09,014 --> 00:19:12,643
Governess to your master's children.
Now, will you kindly let me pass?

219
00:19:12,718 --> 00:19:14,709
Certainly.

220
00:19:14,786 --> 00:19:18,153
As for telling Sir Pitt,
there's no need.

221
00:19:19,158 --> 00:19:22,389
Why not?
You've just told him yourself.

222
00:19:46,952 --> 00:19:49,386
<i>¤¤For these and all Thy other gifts ¤¤</i>

223
00:19:49,454 --> 00:19:52,048
¤ May the Lord make us truly thankful ¤

224
00:19:52,124 --> 00:19:56,527
<i>¤¤Amen ¤¤¤¤
Ah.!</i>

225
00:19:56,595 --> 00:19:59,086
<i>You haven't met Lady Crawley,
my dear.</i>

226
00:19:59,164 --> 00:20:01,894
She's the girls' mother.
She's not the mother of my sons.

227
00:20:01,967 --> 00:20:04,697
<i>Is she, Pitt? No.</i>

228
00:20:04,770 --> 00:20:09,764
Pitt's mother, my first wife,
she was the daughter of a lord,

229
00:20:09,841 --> 00:20:14,301
<i>which makes him grander
than all of us put together,
doesn't it, Pitt?</i>

230
00:20:14,379 --> 00:20:17,280
Whatever you say, sir.

231
00:20:17,349 --> 00:20:20,011
Oh, yes. Very grand.

232
00:20:20,085 --> 00:20:22,383
Too grand for me.
But this one ain't.

233
00:20:23,655 --> 00:20:27,318
<i>Her father was an ironmonger,
wasn't he, my lady?</i>

234
00:20:28,794 --> 00:20:31,160
<i>He was, sir.
Yeah.</i>

235
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:33,391
When shall we discuss
the girls' lessons?

236
00:20:33,465 --> 00:20:35,956
My strengths are music,
drawing and French,

237
00:20:36,034 --> 00:20:38,059
but I can teach them
whatever you wish.

238
00:20:38,136 --> 00:20:41,970
You'll be kind to my girls,
Miss Sharp?

239
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:44,838
Oh!

240
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:48,778
Don't worry. I'll treat them
just as sensitively as they deserve.

241
00:20:48,847 --> 00:20:50,940
Hmph.
Hmph.

242
00:20:51,016 --> 00:20:53,985
What is this?
It's, uh,

243
00:20:54,052 --> 00:20:56,111
<i>"Potage de mouton à I'Ecossaise. '"</i>

244
00:20:56,188 --> 00:20:59,089
<i>Oh, mutton broth.</i>

245
00:20:59,157 --> 00:21:02,524
What sheep was it, Horrocks?
When did you kill?

246
00:21:02,594 --> 00:21:06,587
One of the black-faced Scots, Sir Pitt.
We killed on Thursday.

247
00:21:06,665 --> 00:21:08,963
Did she squeal?
Didn't she just.

248
00:21:09,034 --> 00:21:13,198
Oh, good.
Always improves the flavor, that.

249
00:21:14,773 --> 00:21:17,333
<i>Oh.
"To be honest, dearest Amelia,</i>

250
00:21:17,409 --> 00:21:20,867
"Sir Pitt is not what you and I
would think a baronet should be.

251
00:21:20,946 --> 00:21:24,541
More ancient stable than ancient fable."

252
00:21:26,718 --> 00:21:30,518
<i>No lights after 11:;00,
you little hussy.</i>

253
00:21:30,589 --> 00:21:33,524
Go to bed in the dark,

254
00:21:33,592 --> 00:21:38,928
unless you'd like me to come in
for your candle every night, hmm?

255
00:21:50,575 --> 00:21:54,204
<i>"All in all, my hopes for the family lie
with Sir Pitt's younger son,</i>

256
00:21:54,279 --> 00:21:58,045
<i>Captain Rawdon Crawley,
who will soon be back from
his regiment. '"</i>

257
00:21:58,116 --> 00:22:00,448
I would like...

258
00:22:00,519 --> 00:22:03,579
to go to Spain.

259
00:22:03,655 --> 00:22:07,853
<i>Je voudrais allez en Spain.</i>

260
00:22:07,926 --> 00:22:09,860
And that's an "E."

261
00:22:10,929 --> 00:22:14,888
<i>"His brother, Mr. Pitt Crawley, meanwhile,
has the charm of an undertaker...</i>

<i>and the humor of a corpse. '"</i>

263
00:22:19,304 --> 00:22:21,602
Uh, Miss Sharp,

264
00:22:21,673 --> 00:22:25,609
I thought you might like to see
my pamphlet on the Chickasaw tribes.

265
00:22:28,647 --> 00:22:33,482
<i>I swear, Mr. Crawley,
you must be a mind reader.</i>

266
00:22:33,552 --> 00:22:36,214
For there is no subject
of more interest to me.

267
00:22:38,623 --> 00:22:44,061
"You'll be happy to hear I've found a way
to make myself indispensable to Sir Pitt.

268

<i>There is to be a visitor
at Humdrum Hall. '"</i>

269
00:22:47,833 --> 00:22:49,858

Be careful with that.

No! No, no!</i>

272
00:22:58,043 --> 00:23:01,740
<i>No, no, no, no!

They'll be after you to marry next.

00:24:25,096 --> 00:24:28,497
Oh, Aunt Tilly, how could I,
when my heart belongs to you?

291
00:24:30,035 --> 00:24:32,799
- Matilda!
- Wicked boy!

292
00:24:32,871 --> 00:24:35,396
Welcome.

293
00:24:35,474 --> 00:24:39,069
Brother.
You know
Lady Southdown, I think,

294
00:24:39,144 --> 00:24:41,408
and her daughter, LadyJane.

295
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:44,677
Aunt Matilda,
on behalf of the entire Crawley...

296
00:24:44,749 --> 00:24:46,717
Keep your toadying
till I get to a fire.

297
00:24:46,785 --> 00:24:50,050
You can suck up all you wish
once I'm warm.

298
00:24:52,057 --> 00:24:54,321
Well, that's put us in our place.

299
00:24:54,392 --> 00:24:57,327
We may have the titles, Mama,
but Miss Crawley has the money.

300
00:24:57,395 --> 00:24:59,420
Mm, and don't we know it.

301
00:25:00,499 --> 00:25:02,524
<i>Put the trunk inside.!</i>

302
00:25:04,469 --> 00:25:07,996
<i>Now, Miss Becky,</i>

303
00:25:08,073 --> 00:25:10,234
this is my younger son,
Rawdon.

304
00:25:10,308 --> 00:25:14,608
<i>And mind you stay clear
ofhis fluttering lashes.</i>

305
00:25:14,679 --> 00:25:16,670
He breaks hearts
for a hobby, but...

306
00:25:16,748 --> 00:25:18,875
he's a soldier
through and through.

307
00:25:18,950 --> 00:25:22,511
- I'm warned.
- Mm-hmm.

308
00:25:34,432 --> 00:25:37,924
<i>With a little liquor, I can do it.</i>

309
00:25:38,003 --> 00:25:41,097
You must be bored
as a brick down here.

310
00:25:41,172 --> 00:25:43,367
I have your father
and brother for company.

311
00:25:43,441 --> 00:25:45,966
Precisely.

312
00:25:46,044 --> 00:25:48,410
Not a great many laughs
in Miss Crawley, I can tell you.

313
00:25:50,649 --> 00:25:54,551
I seem to remember
anchovy paste is a favorite delicacy
of yours, Aunt Tilly.

314
00:25:54,619 --> 00:25:57,144
But not for do... doggies.

315
00:25:57,222 --> 00:26:00,282
I don't agree.
I suspect she's the quickest wit
in the room.

316
00:26:00,358 --> 00:26:03,555
No, no, no.
I mean my brother, not my aunt.

317
00:26:03,628 --> 00:26:06,256
They used to call him
"Miss Crawley" at Eton.

318
00:26:06,331 --> 00:26:09,630
Go on. Admit it.

319
00:26:09,701 --> 00:26:13,831
<i>He looks a little underweight.
He's the dullest dog
in shoe leather.</i>

320
00:26:15,373 --> 00:26:17,398
Really, Captain Crawley.

321
00:26:17,475 --> 00:26:20,069
Are you trying to steer me
towards an indiscretion?

322
00:26:20,145 --> 00:26:22,136
Why?

323
00:26:22,213 --> 00:26:24,443
Would you like me to?

324
00:26:24,516 --> 00:26:27,679
No man has managed it yet.

325
00:26:32,057 --> 00:26:36,016
- What was that?
- Nothing. A false note.

326
00:26:40,932 --> 00:26:44,868
<i>Allez, Rose, Celia. Dépêchez.</i>

327
00:26:44,936 --> 00:26:48,463
Faites vosà obeissances a votre tante.

328
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:50,303
<i>Don't waste your time,
Miss Sharp.</i>

329
00:26:50,375 --> 00:26:53,344
All foreign languages
are ancient Greek to my sisters.

330
00:26:53,411 --> 00:26:56,141
And they always will be
if they're not spoken before them.

331
00:26:56,214 --> 00:27:01,174
I quite agree, Miss Sharp.
What a treat to find someone
cultured in this house.

332
00:27:01,252 --> 00:27:04,779
<i>Vous parlez bien.
Merci.
My mother was French.</i>

333
00:27:04,856 --> 00:27:06,790
A French mother?

334
00:27:06,858 --> 00:27:09,884
Now, that's altogether
too romantic for a governess.

335
00:27:09,961 --> 00:27:14,660
Who was she?
Have you heard
of the Montmorencys?

336
00:27:14,733 --> 00:27:17,031
<i>Who has not?</i>

337
00:27:17,102 --> 00:27:20,560
<i>So, you're an impoverished aristocrat.</i>

338
00:27:20,639 --> 00:27:24,234
Pity.
I had you down for an adventuress.

339
00:27:24,309 --> 00:27:26,402
And are they mutually exclusive?

340
00:27:26,478 --> 00:27:30,539
<i>Oh, please tell me there's something
disreputable in your past.</i>

341
00:27:30,615 --> 00:27:33,743
Well, my father was an artist.

342
00:27:33,818 --> 00:27:36,844
Ah, that's better.
A starving one, I hope.

343
00:27:36,921 --> 00:27:39,412
Absolutely ravenous.

344
00:27:39,491 --> 00:27:41,857
Who's ravenous... besides me?

345
00:27:41,926 --> 00:27:45,384
Horrocks? When's dinner?
Any minute now,
Sir Pitt.

346
00:27:45,463 --> 00:27:47,488
Good.
I'd best excuse myself.

347
00:27:47,565 --> 00:27:49,533
Come along, girls.

348
00:27:49,601 --> 00:27:54,095
- Is Miss Sharp not to dine with us?
- Well, don't ask me. Ask Pitt.

349
00:27:54,172 --> 00:27:56,106
<i>Mm.
Nephew?</i>

350
00:27:56,174 --> 00:27:58,267
I hope she's not banished
in my honor.

351
00:27:58,343 --> 00:28:01,244
You know I am nothing
if not democratic.

352
00:28:01,312 --> 00:28:05,305
It's no great sacrifice
in the cause of peace.

353
00:28:05,383 --> 00:28:08,716
Of course,
Miss Sharp must dine with us
if you wish it, Aunt.

354
00:28:08,787 --> 00:28:11,688
Dinner is served!

355
00:28:11,756 --> 00:28:15,817
Good!
Come along, my dear.
You'll sit by me.

356
00:28:15,894 --> 00:28:19,091
And after dinner,
we shall abuse the company.

357
00:28:19,164 --> 00:28:22,656
Really,
the hoops she makes
us jump through.

358
00:28:22,734 --> 00:28:26,101
I don't mind, Mama.
I like Miss Sharp.
Mm.

359
00:28:26,171 --> 00:28:29,698
Caesar liked Brutus
and look where it got him.

360
00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:35,612
<i>- ¤¤All these and all Thy other gifts may...¤¤
- Pitt!</i>

361
00:28:36,681 --> 00:28:39,047
Amen.

362
00:28:40,885 --> 00:28:44,582
<i>Aunt Matilda,
you are the guest ofhonor.</i>

363
00:28:44,656 --> 00:28:46,886
Um, what shall we drink to?

364
00:28:46,958 --> 00:28:49,620
<i>Better food and a warmer room.</i>

365
00:28:49,694 --> 00:28:53,994
Should we not drink to peace at
last... with Napoleon safe on Elba?

366
00:28:54,065 --> 00:28:57,933
To the men who put him there...
to Wellington and Nelson.

367
00:28:58,002 --> 00:29:00,300
<i>Wellington and Nelson.</i>

368
00:29:00,371 --> 00:29:03,465
Wellington I grant you, hmm,

369
00:29:03,541 --> 00:29:07,409
but, um, it is hard
to match Nelson's heroism...

370
00:29:07,479 --> 00:29:09,413
<i>with his private life.</i>

371
00:29:09,481 --> 00:29:12,848
<i>The life of Alexander
did not bear much scrutiny.</i>

372
00:29:12,917 --> 00:29:16,683
Is he not a hero, either?
Quite right, Miss Sharp.

373
00:29:16,755 --> 00:29:20,748
And to my mind, that was
the best part of Nelson's character!

374
00:29:20,825 --> 00:29:22,986
He went to the deuce for a woman.

375
00:29:23,061 --> 00:29:25,757
<i>There must be some good
in a man who'll do that.
Hmm.</i>

376
00:29:25,830 --> 00:29:29,163
I adore imprudent matches.

377
00:29:29,234 --> 00:29:32,169
- Wellington and Nelson.
- Wellington...

378
00:29:32,237 --> 00:29:35,604
Mm. You set no store
by birth, then?

379
00:29:35,673 --> 00:29:40,133
<i>Birth?
Look at this family.!</i>

380
00:29:40,211 --> 00:29:43,305
We've been
at Queen's Crawley
since Henry II,

381
00:29:43,381 --> 00:29:46,680
but not one of us here
is as clever as Miss Sharp.

382
00:29:48,453 --> 00:29:52,321
- To all the King's officers!
- All the King's officers!

383
00:29:52,390 --> 00:29:55,325
The King's officers.

384
00:29:58,363 --> 00:30:01,298
Mmm, lobster.

385
00:30:04,569 --> 00:30:07,902
Delicious.

386
00:30:15,246 --> 00:30:19,046
<i>Come in, my dear.
I've left my toadies in London.</i>

387
00:30:19,117 --> 00:30:21,483
And what bores they are
downstairs.

388
00:30:21,553 --> 00:30:23,521
It falls to you
to make me laugh.

389
00:30:23,588 --> 00:30:25,647
She's clever enough,
isn't she, Firkin?

390
00:30:25,723 --> 00:30:28,157
I think Miss seems
very clever.
Oh, yes.

391
00:30:28,226 --> 00:30:31,195
If merit had its just reward,
you ought to be a duchess.

392
00:30:31,262 --> 00:30:34,425
Mm.
You set no store by birth, then?

393
00:30:34,499 --> 00:30:36,433
Mm.

394
00:30:36,501 --> 00:30:39,959
Silly old fool,
grabbing at my money
for her daughter's intended,

395
00:30:40,038 --> 00:30:41,972
that hypocrite Pitt.

396
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:44,838
He should put down his Bible
and do the dirty work himself.

397
00:30:44,909 --> 00:30:49,573
<i>With a decent position,
you could put the world on a leash.</i>

398
00:30:49,647 --> 00:30:52,207
Perhaps I'll surprise you
and run away with a great man.

399
00:30:52,283 --> 00:30:54,911
Oh, that'd be perfect.
I love elopements.

400
00:30:54,986 --> 00:30:57,716
I've set my heart on Rawdon
running away with someone.

401
00:30:57,789 --> 00:31:00,553
A rich someone
or a poor someone?

402
00:31:00,625 --> 00:31:03,355
Well, above all,
a clever someone.

403
00:31:03,428 --> 00:31:07,660
He's the dearest of creatures,
but not the wisest.

404
00:31:09,767 --> 00:31:11,826
What's the matter?

405
00:31:11,903 --> 00:31:14,428
Oh, it's the lobster.

406
00:31:14,505 --> 00:31:18,066
They've poisoned me
with the lobster.

407
00:31:27,652 --> 00:31:29,586
Off you go.

408
00:31:31,222 --> 00:31:35,124
<i>Sir Pitt? Mm.</i>

409
00:31:35,193 --> 00:31:37,286
<i>Can I not be of any assistance?</i>

410
00:31:37,362 --> 00:31:41,992
<i>L- I don't think so, madam.
The doctor is with her now.</i>

411
00:31:42,066 --> 00:31:45,524
The best we can do
is pray, pray for her soul.
Mm.

412
00:31:45,603 --> 00:31:48,003
And for her
hundred thousand.
Ohh.

413
00:31:51,175 --> 00:31:53,268
<i>Will she live, Doctor?</i>

414
00:31:53,344 --> 00:31:56,802
<i>Well, I've pumped her.
I've purged her.</i>

415
00:31:56,881 --> 00:31:59,406
There's nothing more I can do.

416
00:31:59,484 --> 00:32:02,214
Now, it rests with the Lord.

417
00:32:02,287 --> 00:32:05,586
Uh, would you like to settle
with me now, Sir Pitt?

418
00:32:05,657 --> 00:32:07,716
Tomorrow,
if you don't mind, Doctor.

419
00:32:07,792 --> 00:32:10,989
I only pays on results.

420
00:32:15,767 --> 00:32:17,894
<i>How do I look?</i>

421
00:32:17,969 --> 00:32:20,938
A good deal stronger.
They will be disappointed.

422
00:32:21,005 --> 00:32:24,463
Lady Southdown hovers
at the door night and noon.

423
00:32:24,542 --> 00:32:28,535
"Mm-mm, I always travel
with my medicine chest.

424
00:32:28,613 --> 00:32:30,706
"Can I not be of any assistance...

425
00:32:30,782 --> 00:32:33,512
with my special tonics?"

426
00:32:37,889 --> 00:32:39,823
<i>That's a dose I doubt I'd live through.</i>

427
00:32:39,891 --> 00:32:43,452
Nonsense!
It's Captain Rawdon
that needs you dead.

428
00:32:43,528 --> 00:32:46,861
Lady Southdown and Mr. Pitt Crawley
want you well enough to change your will.

429
00:32:50,635 --> 00:32:54,537
Rebecca Sharp,
I've made up my mind.

430
00:32:54,605 --> 00:32:58,063
You must come with me
to London.

431
00:32:58,142 --> 00:33:00,508
I insist upon it,
and so does Byron.

432
00:33:00,578 --> 00:33:03,479
And we won't be gainsaid,
will we?

433
00:33:03,548 --> 00:33:07,314
But what could I say
to dear Sir Pitt,
after all his kindness?

434
00:33:07,385 --> 00:33:09,751
Oh, leave him to me.

435
00:33:09,821 --> 00:33:12,483
When a man has two sons
and a rich spinster sister,

436
00:33:12,557 --> 00:33:15,025
he seldom gainsays her,
my dear.

437
00:33:26,237 --> 00:33:29,400
Must you go, Rawdon?
Uh, l-I thought you might stay
for some shooting.

438
00:33:29,474 --> 00:33:32,409
Oh, no. I... I thought it best
to see them safely back home...

439
00:33:32,477 --> 00:33:34,570
to, uh, Mayfair.

440
00:33:42,954 --> 00:33:44,888
Clear the way, there!

441
00:33:44,956 --> 00:33:48,585
There she goes,
the best little governess
the girls ever had.

442
00:33:48,659 --> 00:33:53,153
Mm, mm.
Suppose I better write to
Miss Pinkerton for a replacement.

443
00:33:53,231 --> 00:33:55,290
Let me, Sir Pitt.

444
00:33:55,366 --> 00:34:00,099
Mm, Miss Pinkerton is an old friend,
and I should so like to be useful.

445
00:34:00,171 --> 00:34:03,470
Mm.

446
00:34:03,541 --> 00:34:06,135
Meddlesome old cat.

447
00:34:07,478 --> 00:34:10,174
<i>"My dear, Miss Pinkerton, mm.</i>

448
00:34:10,248 --> 00:34:13,809
<i>"Apupil of yours has recently
come to my notice, mm.</i>

449
00:34:13,885 --> 00:34:18,151
<i>"I should so like to know
more ofher history.</i>

450
00:34:18,222 --> 00:34:21,282
<i>Her name is Rebecca Sharp. '"</i>

451
00:35:02,033 --> 00:35:05,264
The governor will miss you.

452
00:35:05,336 --> 00:35:07,861
Sir Pitt has been good to me.

453
00:35:08,906 --> 00:35:10,840
Who wouldn't be?

454
00:35:43,074 --> 00:35:46,407
Apples! Juicy apples!
Come on, people!
Juicy apples!

455
00:36:09,467 --> 00:36:12,527
Welcome to London.

456
00:36:24,582 --> 00:36:27,107
<i>Oh, goodness.! Look busy.
The mistress is home.!</i>

457
00:36:59,817 --> 00:37:02,285
Here we are, my dear.

458
00:37:02,353 --> 00:37:04,878
Who was that?

459
00:37:04,956 --> 00:37:08,585
It's my neighbor,
the Marquess of Steyne.
Why?

460
00:37:08,659 --> 00:37:11,287
No reason.

461
00:37:26,777 --> 00:37:30,611
Are you going out?
I'm meeting Tarquin and Villiers.

462
00:37:30,681 --> 00:37:33,115
<i>And the rest of the chaps.</i>

463
00:37:33,184 --> 00:37:36,153
We might play some billiards.
Ah, yeah.

464
00:37:36,220 --> 00:37:41,021
Lord Tarquin
and the HonorableJohn Villiers.

465
00:37:41,092 --> 00:37:43,458
It is not done to pronounce
"the Honorable" aloud.

466
00:37:43,527 --> 00:37:47,759
Well, well.
You know these things
better than I.

467
00:37:47,832 --> 00:37:52,599
What I wonder is: Do they ask
you to their homes, these chaps?

468
00:37:52,670 --> 00:37:56,504
Do you meet their mothers
and their sisters?

469
00:37:56,574 --> 00:37:58,838
Sometimes.

470
00:37:58,909 --> 00:38:01,605
Because you shall not want,
you know?

471
00:38:03,214 --> 00:38:06,445
The British merchant's son
shan't want.

472
00:38:06,517 --> 00:38:10,954
<i>You may marry whom you please
and keep her well.
Father.</i>

473
00:38:11,022 --> 00:38:13,490
George is engaged.
It's understood...

474
00:38:13,557 --> 00:38:15,957
Then it can be un-understood.

475
00:38:16,027 --> 00:38:18,791
Don't you see, boy?

476
00:38:18,863 --> 00:38:22,196
There's nothing you can't have
if you will reach for it.

477
00:38:22,266 --> 00:38:25,861
Why not a viscount's daughter?
Better yet, an earl's.

478
00:38:25,936 --> 00:38:28,871
Or marry an heiress
and buy a peerage for yourself!

479
00:38:32,276 --> 00:38:36,679
You shouldn't read in a carriage.
It will make you sick.

480
00:38:36,747 --> 00:38:38,681
Reading always makes me sick.

481
00:38:38,749 --> 00:38:41,309
Who's it from?

482
00:38:41,385 --> 00:38:43,546
My friend, Amelia Sedley.

483
00:38:43,621 --> 00:38:46,749
I thought she might have set a date
for her marriage, but it seems not.

484
00:38:46,824 --> 00:38:50,385
And who is her intended?
Captain George Osborne.

485
00:38:50,461 --> 00:38:52,861
Osborne?

486
00:38:52,930 --> 00:38:55,262
Any relation to the Duke of Leeds?

487
00:38:55,333 --> 00:38:57,597
Oh, no, ma'am.
He's a tradesman's son.

488
00:38:57,668 --> 00:38:59,727
Oh!
I know Osborne.

489
00:38:59,804 --> 00:39:03,706
He's in one of the line regiments.
He's as green as this grass...

490
00:39:03,774 --> 00:39:07,676
<i>and will go to the deuce
to be seen with a lord.</i>

491
00:39:07,745 --> 00:39:10,771
Captain Osborne's vanity
must make him a tempting victim.

492
00:39:10,848 --> 00:39:15,217
I say, Aunt. Why don't we do
Miss Sharp a favor...

493
00:39:15,286 --> 00:39:19,552
and invite them over?
If you think it would be amusing.

494
00:39:34,038 --> 00:39:37,064
I am glad to see
Miss Crawley knows your worth.

495
00:39:37,141 --> 00:39:40,975
As long as George knows yours.
Of course he does.

496
00:39:42,079 --> 00:39:45,139
<i>- Shall I play for you?
- Oh, thank you, my dear.</i>

497
00:39:45,216 --> 00:39:49,277
Rawdon, will you explain
the rules of piquet to Miss Sedley?

498
00:39:49,353 --> 00:39:51,878
- I've quite forgotten.
- Be careful, Amelia.

499
00:39:51,956 --> 00:39:54,584
Captain Crawley
knows his cards.
I'm warned.

500
00:39:54,658 --> 00:39:56,649
Oh, there are
no fortunes in piquet.

501
00:39:56,727 --> 00:40:00,686
All the same, be kind to her.
She is my only friend.

502
00:40:00,765 --> 00:40:02,892
Not your only friend,
Miss Sharp.

503
00:40:06,637 --> 00:40:08,571
<i>Rawdon, you explain.</i>

504
00:40:08,639 --> 00:40:11,472
<i>Now, come along.</i>

505
00:40:11,542 --> 00:40:15,478
<i>- You may discard up to five.
- Oh, do go away.</i>

506
00:40:20,651 --> 00:40:24,143
So, Miss Sharp.

507
00:40:26,657 --> 00:40:29,751
- How do you like your new place?
- My place?

508
00:40:29,827 --> 00:40:31,818
How kind of you to remind me.

509
00:40:31,896 --> 00:40:35,491
It's quite tolerable, thank you.

510
00:40:35,566 --> 00:40:38,126
And they treat me very well.

511
00:40:38,202 --> 00:40:40,295
But then,
this is a gentleman's family...

512
00:40:40,371 --> 00:40:43,067
and quite a change
from tradespeople.

513
00:40:43,140 --> 00:40:46,268
You seemed to like tradespeople
well enough last year.

514
00:40:46,343 --> 00:40:49,369
Joseph Sedley, you mean?
It's true.

515
00:40:49,447 --> 00:40:51,711
If he'd asked me,
I would not have said no.

516
00:40:51,782 --> 00:40:55,946
How very obliging of you.

517
00:40:57,221 --> 00:40:59,553
I know what you're thinking.

518
00:40:59,623 --> 00:41:02,387
What an honor to have had you
for a brother-in-law.

519
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:06,191
Captain George Osborne,
son ofJohn Osborne, Esquire,

520
00:41:06,263 --> 00:41:08,731
son of...
what was your grandfather?

521
00:41:10,034 --> 00:41:13,800
Never mind.
You cannot help your pedigree.

522
00:41:16,707 --> 00:41:20,700
<i>Miss Sharp.
Come and take over from Rawdon.</i>

523
00:41:20,778 --> 00:41:23,576
He's worse than useless.

524
00:41:23,647 --> 00:41:28,641
Ah, 'tis true.
This is not my game.

525
00:41:28,719 --> 00:41:33,349
Osborne, would you care to come
and play something a little more grown up?

526
00:41:46,270 --> 00:41:48,602
Bye!

527
00:41:48,672 --> 00:41:51,368
Do thank
Miss Crawley for us!
Crawley. Miss Sharp.

528
00:41:51,442 --> 00:41:55,139
Are you cross with me?

529
00:41:55,212 --> 00:41:58,181
Cross? I could kiss you.

530
00:41:58,249 --> 00:42:01,980
To see George Osborne fleeced
makes the perfect end to the perfect day.

531
00:42:02,052 --> 00:42:04,077
Oh, dear!

532
00:42:04,154 --> 00:42:06,645
I was rather hoping
the evening wasn't over yet.

533
00:42:08,359 --> 00:42:10,293
Oh?

534
00:42:12,263 --> 00:42:14,197
I was wondering...

535
00:42:15,566 --> 00:42:18,831
if you might like to
show me your room.

536
00:42:19,937 --> 00:42:22,030
Of course.

537
00:42:22,106 --> 00:42:25,872
I'll run and ask
Miss Crawley's permission.

538
00:42:25,943 --> 00:42:28,605
Don't joke.

539
00:42:45,362 --> 00:42:47,296
Really, Captain.

540
00:42:47,364 --> 00:42:51,095
You cannot imagine I would do anything
to incur your aunt's displeasure.

541
00:42:53,370 --> 00:42:57,704
I thought you and I
had an understanding.

542
00:42:57,775 --> 00:43:01,336
Well, I understand this.

543
00:43:01,412 --> 00:43:04,745
Two men and two men only
will enter my bed chamber...

544
00:43:04,815 --> 00:43:08,751
my husband and the doctor.

545
00:43:13,924 --> 00:43:16,222
You know my heart, Becky.

546
00:43:18,329 --> 00:43:20,490
You know
I'd do anything for you.

547
00:43:21,765 --> 00:43:24,097
I'm flattered.

548
00:43:24,168 --> 00:43:28,867
But Aunt Tilly's
views on these things
came out of the Ark.

549
00:43:28,939 --> 00:43:33,433
That's not how she sounds.
Oh, don't be deceived.

550
00:43:33,510 --> 00:43:36,604
She talks like Oliver Cromwell
but thinks like Charles I,

551
00:43:36,680 --> 00:43:40,707
and, believe me,
it's an outside wager
she'll ever change her mind.

552
00:43:45,589 --> 00:43:48,717
It's lucky, then, Captain,

553
00:43:48,792 --> 00:43:51,920
that you're a gambling man...

554
00:43:53,030 --> 00:43:55,863
and no stranger
to taking a chance.

555
00:44:28,432 --> 00:44:32,664
"Dearest Becky, a letter from Jos
arrived from India this morning...

556
00:44:32,736 --> 00:44:36,365
filled with regrets
about a certain person."

557
00:44:36,440 --> 00:44:39,807
Has Miss Sharp
taken to Mayfair?

558
00:44:42,513 --> 00:44:45,209
She seems quite at home
in her new life.

559
00:44:45,282 --> 00:44:47,409
I do not doubt it.

560
00:44:47,484 --> 00:44:50,112
I had thought her
a mere social climber.

561
00:44:50,187 --> 00:44:52,747
I see now
she's a mountaineer.

562
00:44:57,428 --> 00:44:59,589
"I should tell him, dear Becky,

563
00:44:59,663 --> 00:45:03,759
"he has missed his chance
for his goddess has acquired
other suitors.

564
00:45:03,834 --> 00:45:07,099
<i>Your loving friend,
Amelia Sedley. '"</i>

565
00:45:16,780 --> 00:45:18,714
Aahhh.

566
00:45:19,883 --> 00:45:23,979
This one's for you.
It's from Mr. Pitt.
Read it.

567
00:45:27,524 --> 00:45:31,016
"Dear Aunt,
I have both happy
and sad news to relay.

568
00:45:31,095 --> 00:45:33,529
"The good news
is that I'm married.

569
00:45:33,597 --> 00:45:37,055
LadyJane Sheepshanks has done me
the honor of becoming my wife."

570
00:45:37,134 --> 00:45:39,329
Well, no great surprise there.

571
00:45:39,403 --> 00:45:41,337
Well, she's a nice enough girl.

572
00:45:41,405 --> 00:45:43,873
Although, I don't envy him
his mother-in-law.

573
00:45:43,941 --> 00:45:46,273
What's the bad news?

574
00:45:46,343 --> 00:45:51,007
"I am sorry to tell you
that my stepmother, Lady Crawley,
has gone to a better place."

575
00:45:51,081 --> 00:45:53,777
After Queen's Crawley,
almost anywhere's a better place.

576
00:45:53,851 --> 00:45:58,254
Come on!
The best thing for you, my girl,
would be...

577
00:45:58,322 --> 00:46:00,449
No, no. Too strict.

578
00:46:00,524 --> 00:46:02,458
Hmm. Thank you.

579
00:46:05,295 --> 00:46:07,422
Madam,

580
00:46:07,498 --> 00:46:11,264
would you consider, um...

581
00:46:11,335 --> 00:46:15,567
Good gracious!
Here's Sir Pitt!
Oh, my dear, l-l-I can't see him.

582
00:46:15,639 --> 00:46:17,800
My mood,
my nerves won't stand it.

583
00:46:17,875 --> 00:46:20,605
<i>- Go away.!
- Yes, Sir Pitt.</i>

584
00:46:22,012 --> 00:46:23,946
<i>Ah, good.!</i>

585
00:46:24,014 --> 00:46:26,676
It's-It's not Miss Crawley
I want to see, it's you.

586
00:46:28,452 --> 00:46:30,818
You have to come back
to Queen's Crawley.

587
00:46:30,888 --> 00:46:33,379
You've heard my news?
Only just now.

588
00:46:33,457 --> 00:46:36,017
I'm very sorry.
If there's anything I can do...

589
00:46:36,093 --> 00:46:39,119
There is. There's plenty for you to do.
Everything's wrong since you left.

590
00:46:39,196 --> 00:46:41,824
You must come back!
Well...

591
00:46:46,770 --> 00:46:49,864
Marry me!

592
00:46:49,940 --> 00:46:53,239
<i>Come back as Lady Crawley,
if you like.</i>

593
00:46:53,310 --> 00:46:56,973
But do come back!

594
00:47:02,152 --> 00:47:04,882
What? Oh!

595
00:47:08,992 --> 00:47:11,756
- Don't leave me down here forever.
- Oh, Sir Pitt.

596
00:47:13,297 --> 00:47:17,290
I can't.
Can't or won't?

597
00:47:17,367 --> 00:47:19,358
Wouldn't you like to be
an old man's darling?

598
00:47:19,436 --> 00:47:23,031
No, Sir Pitt, I really can't.

599
00:47:24,908 --> 00:47:28,366
The truth is, I'm married already.

600
00:47:28,445 --> 00:47:32,040
Married?

601
00:47:32,115 --> 00:47:34,675
Oh well, it was worth a try.

602
00:47:34,751 --> 00:47:38,915
Well, what a chance is lost!

603
00:47:38,989 --> 00:47:42,356
Never mind, my dear,
we'll set him up,
won't we, brother?

604
00:47:42,426 --> 00:47:45,293
I'll buy him a shop
or commission a portrait.

605
00:47:45,362 --> 00:47:49,765
Whoever he is, he and his family
are very lucky to have you.

606
00:47:49,833 --> 00:47:53,200
- I hope you think so.
- Indeed I do.

607
00:47:57,741 --> 00:48:01,541
Then if you cannot take me
for a wife and sister,

608
00:48:01,612 --> 00:48:04,775
will you not love me
as daughter and niece?

609
00:48:04,848 --> 00:48:06,975
What?

610
00:48:09,553 --> 00:48:14,547
Dear Sir Pitt,
dearest Miss Crawley, it's true.

611
00:48:15,893 --> 00:48:18,088
I've married Rawdon.

612
00:48:18,161 --> 00:48:21,028
Rawdon!

613
00:48:21,098 --> 00:48:24,067
My... Rawdon?

614
00:48:37,147 --> 00:48:41,208
Coal!
Pick 'em up, boy.

615
00:48:41,285 --> 00:48:43,344
<i>Look after her, Firkin.</i>

616
00:48:43,420 --> 00:48:46,389
Poor, dear Miss Crawley.
I do worry so.

617
00:48:46,456 --> 00:48:49,016
Don't waste your syrup
on me, Miss Sharp.

618
00:48:49,092 --> 00:48:51,720
Just get back in the knife box
where you belong.

619
00:49:05,676 --> 00:49:09,976
<i>Are you all right, Miss?
I will be if you're going past Baker Street.</i>

620
00:49:10,047 --> 00:49:11,981
<i>Would that be proper, Miss?</i>

621
00:49:12,049 --> 00:49:14,074
More proper than
standing here in the street.

622
00:49:14,151 --> 00:49:16,142
Now give us a hand
with the trunk.

623
00:49:46,817 --> 00:49:50,548
<i>You...</i>

624
00:49:51,955 --> 00:49:54,185
We'll be in Queer Street
if she don't come round.

625
00:49:54,257 --> 00:49:57,658
I'd rather be in Queer Street with you
than Park Lane with any other.

626
00:50:01,798 --> 00:50:06,326
But, Rawdon, she will come round.
She said herself, she'd love you to elope.

627
00:50:08,405 --> 00:50:11,306
It's all talk, you know.

628
00:50:11,375 --> 00:50:15,869
She loves romance in her novels,
but not in her family.

629
00:50:15,946 --> 00:50:20,280
Where they're concerned,
she's as snobbish as Queen Charlotte.

630
00:50:22,252 --> 00:50:24,846
Well, then...

631
00:50:24,921 --> 00:50:28,015
We'll have to send
an ambassador to plead our case.

632
00:50:28,091 --> 00:50:30,457
Oh, yes?
Mm.

633
00:50:31,695 --> 00:50:35,290
What kind of ambassador
would that be?

634
00:50:35,365 --> 00:50:41,031
I'd say a very little one,

635
00:50:41,104 --> 00:50:46,440
with rosy cheeks and blue eyes,

636
00:50:46,510 --> 00:50:50,378
and probably not too much hair.

637
00:50:52,849 --> 00:50:54,942
What?

638
00:50:58,789 --> 00:51:00,780
You mean...

639
00:51:03,060 --> 00:51:08,396
Oh, you brilliant, darling girl.

640
00:51:09,466 --> 00:51:13,664
Well, that will mend fences
if nothing else will.

641
00:51:14,671 --> 00:51:17,299
Oh, Becky!

642
00:51:20,877 --> 00:51:25,041
When one thinks of how she tended you.

643
00:51:25,115 --> 00:51:29,279
And all the time...
Oh, I should have guessed that
nobody does anything for nothing.

644
00:51:29,352 --> 00:51:32,515
But for a pauper's daughter,
a penniless governess,

645
00:51:32,589 --> 00:51:34,853
<i>to make off with my Rawdon.
Ohh.</i>

646
00:51:34,925 --> 00:51:37,018
Oh, dear.

647
00:51:37,094 --> 00:51:41,588
Oh, at least her mother was a Montmorency.
I suppose we must cling to that.

648
00:51:41,665 --> 00:51:43,929
Not a bit of it. I have it
on the best authority.

649
00:51:45,235 --> 00:51:50,036
Her mother was an opera girl
in the chorus at Montmartre!

650
00:51:50,107 --> 00:51:52,041
- What?
- I have it on the best authority.

651
00:51:52,109 --> 00:51:54,942
Yes, yes, yes! All right!

652
00:51:56,246 --> 00:52:00,012
Oh, very well. I know what I must do.

653
00:52:00,083 --> 00:52:02,813
Would you be so kind
as to bring my little desk here?

654
00:52:02,886 --> 00:52:06,481
Certainly. Where is it?
Where's her little desk? I can't see it.

655
00:52:06,556 --> 00:52:09,787
It's over here.

656
00:52:09,860 --> 00:52:13,990
<i>- I almost feel sorry for poor Rawdon.
- Mm...</i>

657
00:52:14,064 --> 00:52:17,465
But I cannot let that girl
profit from her scheming.

658
00:52:17,534 --> 00:52:21,402
Nor should you.

659
00:52:21,471 --> 00:52:25,532
I'm glad to see that
you've changed your opinions.
Firkin.

660
00:52:25,609 --> 00:52:28,669
Do you remember when
you told us all at Queen's Crawley...

661
00:52:32,616 --> 00:52:36,985
That you adored imprudent marriages?

662
00:52:37,053 --> 00:52:42,320
Not in real life.

663
00:52:59,242 --> 00:53:02,541
What do you want?
Time, Osborne, that's what I want.

664
00:53:02,612 --> 00:53:05,080
<i>I owe you nothing.!
I will give you nothing.!</i>

665
00:53:05,148 --> 00:53:08,345
<i>You owe me friendship.!
You have no friendship
coming from me, sir.!</i>

666
00:53:08,418 --> 00:53:10,613
Oh!

667
00:53:24,601 --> 00:53:26,899
<i>Do we have enough of this china?</i>

668
00:53:26,970 --> 00:53:31,168
It's to be a buffet and I don't
want to risk the Crown Derby.

669
00:53:31,241 --> 00:53:33,232
Oh, listen to this.

670
00:53:33,310 --> 00:53:36,711
"Emperor Napoleon Escapes
from Elba and Marches on Paris.

671
00:53:36,780 --> 00:53:39,214
<i>Allies Prepare for War. '"</i>

672
00:53:41,918 --> 00:53:45,945
- Amelia, what's the matter, dear?
- Will it affect George?

673
00:53:46,022 --> 00:53:47,990
Well, he's a soldier, isn't he,
for all his swagger,

674
00:53:48,058 --> 00:53:51,892
and there's more to soldiering
than gold braid and regimental dinners.

675
00:53:53,697 --> 00:53:55,892
Amelia?

676
00:53:55,966 --> 00:53:59,493
Amelia!
Oh!

677
00:53:59,569 --> 00:54:03,630
If she means to be a soldier's wife,
she must learn to bear such things.

678
00:54:03,707 --> 00:54:07,507
<i>Now, I've been thinking about...
I must tell you.
I can put it off no longer.</i>

679
00:54:07,577 --> 00:54:11,013
We're ruined, Mary. Lost.

680
00:54:12,115 --> 00:54:15,346
<i>Everything is gone.
But we're giving a soiree.</i>

681
00:54:16,586 --> 00:54:20,682
There'll be no more soirees
or balls or dinners either.

682
00:54:20,757 --> 00:54:23,783
That life, finished for us.

683
00:54:23,860 --> 00:54:26,124
<i>Oh, my God!</i>

684
00:54:26,196 --> 00:54:30,565
<i>The debt that finished me, the man
who tipped me into the abyss,</i>

685
00:54:30,634 --> 00:54:35,128
is none other than
George's father, John Osborne.

686
00:54:35,205 --> 00:54:40,370
<i>By order of the trustees of the Sedley
Estate, this auction will now commence.</i>

687
00:54:40,443 --> 00:54:45,779
<i>Lot 368, an inlaid ebony writing desk.</i>

688
00:54:45,849 --> 00:54:50,149
<i>Shall we say... four guineas? Five?</i>

689
00:54:50,220 --> 00:54:55,453
<i>Any more? Come on.
Going, going...</i>

690
00:54:55,525 --> 00:54:58,016
Sold.

691
00:54:58,094 --> 00:55:00,654
Lot 369.

692
00:55:01,898 --> 00:55:04,833
<i>A Clemency
Drawing Room Piano.</i>

693
00:55:04,901 --> 00:55:08,064
I sang to that.
Would you like it?

694
00:55:09,072 --> 00:55:12,735
We will start at three guineas.
Four?

695
00:55:12,809 --> 00:55:15,039
- Five.
- Five at the back.

696
00:55:16,780 --> 00:55:18,975
- Six.
- It's Captain Dobbin.

697
00:55:19,049 --> 00:55:21,847
<i>Seven? Eight?
I know him.
He's in the Ninth.</i>

698
00:55:21,918 --> 00:55:24,648
<i>Nine? Ten.</i>

699
00:55:26,122 --> 00:55:29,421
<i>Any more?
Sold to the captain.</i>

700
00:55:30,894 --> 00:55:33,727
Lot 370.

701
00:55:33,797 --> 00:55:38,666
<i>A landscape painting signed,
"Francis Sharp, 1801. '"</i>

702
00:55:39,736 --> 00:55:42,933
What? What's the matter?
My father painted it.

703
00:55:43,006 --> 00:55:45,201
<i>I gave it to Amelia.</i>

704
00:55:45,275 --> 00:55:49,006
<i>- I'll get it for you.
- Shall we say, five guineas?</i>

705
00:55:50,313 --> 00:55:53,009
<i>Six, at the back. Seven.</i>

706
00:55:53,083 --> 00:55:55,711
Eight. Nine.

707
00:55:55,785 --> 00:55:59,186
Ten. Eleven. Twelve.

708
00:55:59,255 --> 00:56:03,021
<i>Thirteen. Fourteen.</i>

709
00:56:04,994 --> 00:56:07,019
<i>Fifteen, at the back.</i>

710
00:56:08,198 --> 00:56:10,723
<i>Going once. Going twice...
Leave it.
It doesn't matter.</i>

711
00:56:10,800 --> 00:56:14,133
Sold for 15 guineas
to the Marquess of Steyne.

712
00:56:16,740 --> 00:56:19,766
<i>Why would Lord Steyne
bother with a little auction like this?</i>

713
00:56:19,843 --> 00:56:21,777
He collects my father's works.

714
00:56:21,845 --> 00:56:25,042
A true collector will go anywhere
to get what he wants.

715
00:56:25,115 --> 00:56:27,845
An amboyna and rosewood
quartetto table.

716
00:56:27,917 --> 00:56:29,885
- Captain Dobbin.
- Miss Sharp.

717
00:56:29,953 --> 00:56:31,944
I beg your pardon,
Mrs. Crawley. Crawley.

718
00:56:32,956 --> 00:56:34,924
Are you taking up
the piano, Captain?

719
00:56:34,991 --> 00:56:39,052
<i>I have a... friend who will
get some use of it, I think.
Any more?</i>

720
00:56:40,130 --> 00:56:43,258
- Indeed she will.
- Good day.

721
00:56:43,333 --> 00:56:45,324
Going... Sold.

722
00:56:47,504 --> 00:56:50,337
<i>I saw Miss Sharp
at the auction this morning.</i>

723
00:56:50,407 --> 00:56:52,841
How is George?

724
00:56:52,909 --> 00:56:56,276
George is well, I think. But busy.

725
00:56:56,346 --> 00:56:58,405
Too busy to come here.

726
00:57:00,183 --> 00:57:02,117
I'll fetch some tea.

727
00:57:13,496 --> 00:57:16,761
When you next see him,
will you give him this?

728
00:57:19,536 --> 00:57:22,505
I painted it.

729
00:57:22,572 --> 00:57:27,703
It's not wrong, is it, to remind him
of the one who loves him most?

730
00:57:27,777 --> 00:57:29,540
Of course not.

731
00:57:47,730 --> 00:57:53,066
Oh, look what he's done!
Oh, isn't he wonderful?

732
00:57:54,137 --> 00:57:56,162
I can't believe it!

733
00:57:56,239 --> 00:57:58,935
Oh, thank God!
Thank God!

734
00:57:59,008 --> 00:58:00,999
Mama! It's all right!

735
00:58:02,378 --> 00:58:05,142
George has bought me the piano,
and he'll be here directly.

736
00:58:09,586 --> 00:58:11,577
Oh, thank God!

737
00:58:21,731 --> 00:58:23,665
I tell you, George, you must go to her.

738
00:58:23,733 --> 00:58:26,065
She's dying.

739
00:58:31,474 --> 00:58:35,934
Miss Sedley asked me to give you
this when I saw you next.

740
00:58:42,652 --> 00:58:45,246
For God's sake, George.
You haven't even opened it.

741
00:58:45,321 --> 00:58:47,380
No need.

742
00:58:49,526 --> 00:58:51,460
They're all the same.

743
00:58:52,595 --> 00:58:57,259
<i>Georgy.! What are you playing at?
We're waiting for you.</i>

744
00:59:04,107 --> 00:59:06,302
<i>Good day to you, Captain Dobbin.
I'm just leaving, sir.</i>

745
00:59:06,376 --> 00:59:09,345
Good.
There's a friend of Maria's
they want me to meet.

746
00:59:21,724 --> 00:59:26,718
Ah, uh, may I present
my son, George?

747
00:59:26,796 --> 00:59:28,821
This is Miss Rhoda Swartz.

748
00:59:31,401 --> 00:59:36,498
Miss Rhoda was talking aboutJamaica
and her sugar plantations there.

749
00:59:36,573 --> 00:59:39,804
Although I don't remember it.

750
00:59:39,876 --> 00:59:41,867
I left when I was three.

751
00:59:47,083 --> 00:59:49,984
Maria, may I borrow you
for a moment, please?

752
00:59:52,522 --> 00:59:55,150
Can you forgive us?

753
01:00:11,908 --> 01:00:15,435
Your father does not much
trouble to conceal his plans.

754
01:00:15,511 --> 01:00:19,140
Which are?
For us to marry, of course.

755
01:00:19,215 --> 01:00:21,706
Indeed.

756
01:00:22,885 --> 01:00:26,048
Come. Sit by me.

757
01:00:36,466 --> 01:00:39,799
Let us speak frankly.

758
01:00:39,869 --> 01:00:43,066
My fortune is great, my birth is not.

759
01:00:43,139 --> 01:00:46,131
So, I must choose
between a poor nobleman...

760
01:00:46,209 --> 01:00:50,771
or a rich bourgeois like you.

761
01:00:53,750 --> 01:00:57,277
Upon my word, you've
a very precise grasp of the matter.

762
01:00:57,353 --> 01:01:01,983
<i>I would have liked a title.</i>

763
01:01:02,058 --> 01:01:06,722
But my guardian says,
if you and I combine our fortunes,

764
01:01:06,796 --> 01:01:09,890
we may buy one
whenever we wish.

765
01:01:15,772 --> 01:01:18,536
I cannot believe you are
seriously suggesting Miss Swartz...

766
01:01:18,608 --> 01:01:20,542
as the companion of
my heart and hearth!

767
01:01:20,610 --> 01:01:22,601
Why not?

768
01:01:23,613 --> 01:01:25,547
Well, to begin with,
she's not English.

769
01:01:27,350 --> 01:01:31,252
Hoity-toity!
Less fastidious, if you please!

770
01:01:32,455 --> 01:01:36,391
What's a shade or two of tawny when
there's half a million on the table?

771
01:01:37,960 --> 01:01:41,623
<i>Why, with that money, we'll have you
in the House of Lords in no time.</i>

772
01:01:41,698 --> 01:01:45,896
<i>Just think. Dining at Kew,
dancing at Carlton House.</i>

773
01:01:45,968 --> 01:01:49,460
- And what of honor?
- Honor?

774
01:01:49,539 --> 01:01:51,473
<i>Yes. Honor.</i>

775
01:01:51,541 --> 01:01:54,635
You may buy a string of ancestors
to hang upon your walls,

776
01:01:54,711 --> 01:01:57,441
but I see you have not bought
the breeding that goes with them.

777
01:01:58,915 --> 01:02:03,215
- You made me give my word to Amelia.
- Be silent, sir!

778
01:02:03,286 --> 01:02:05,516
You dare speak
that object's name to me?

779
01:02:07,090 --> 01:02:11,618
"Dare," sir, is not a word to be
used to a captain in the British army.

780
01:02:11,694 --> 01:02:13,753
For I am a gentleman,
though I am your son.

781
01:02:13,830 --> 01:02:16,628
I'll say what I like to my own child.
And I say this:

782
01:02:16,699 --> 01:02:20,931
I have not slaved for 40 years
to see you marry a beggar maid!

783
01:02:21,003 --> 01:02:23,938
You made the match!
And I can unmake it!

784
01:02:24,006 --> 01:02:27,100
You will marry whom I say, sir.
And I say you will marry Miss Swartz.

785
01:02:27,176 --> 01:02:31,636
<i>Either that or take your pack and walk
out of this house without a shilling.!</i>

786
01:02:31,714 --> 01:02:34,182
Do I make myself clear, sir?

787
01:02:35,785 --> 01:02:37,946
As a bell, sir.

788
01:02:42,492 --> 01:02:46,952
<i>Georgy. Georgy.</i>

789
01:02:47,396 --> 01:02:51,196
<i>Come on, you lads.!
War is come to Europe.!</i>

790
01:02:52,301 --> 01:02:54,292
<i>My brother wants tojoin.!</i>

791
01:03:12,388 --> 01:03:14,652
If you're here to plead his case,
you've made a wasted journey.

792
01:03:14,724 --> 01:03:18,888
Mr. Osborne, we're on the brink of war.

793
01:03:18,961 --> 01:03:23,660
Should anything happen to George,
you'd never forgive yourself
if you hadn't parted in charity.

794
01:03:25,201 --> 01:03:27,829
May I not take him
a message from you? Please.

795
01:03:32,909 --> 01:03:34,774
Very well.

796
01:03:34,844 --> 01:03:39,008
Let him only come home to his old room
and things will be as they were before.

797
01:03:40,149 --> 01:03:42,413
They cannot be.

798
01:03:42,485 --> 01:03:44,453
Why not, if I say they can?
Because...

799
01:03:44,520 --> 01:03:48,957
George married
Miss Sedley this morning.

800
01:03:50,493 --> 01:03:53,291
I go from here to
their wedding breakfast.

801
01:03:55,264 --> 01:03:57,425
Will you not come with me?

802
01:04:21,324 --> 01:04:24,316
Welcome, Mr. Sedley.
Sedley. Welcome home.

803
01:04:24,393 --> 01:04:26,861
- Crawley.
- Righto.

804
01:04:26,929 --> 01:04:30,421
Mrs. Crawley.
So,

805
01:04:30,499 --> 01:04:33,400
have you found many changes
since your last visit from India?

806
01:04:33,469 --> 01:04:37,098
Some.

807
01:04:37,173 --> 01:04:40,301
And one in particular
that I regret very much.

808
01:04:44,413 --> 01:04:46,643
<i>Dobbin.! Osborne.!</i>

809
01:04:46,716 --> 01:04:50,743
There's news here for all of us.
It's the order for Belgium.

810
01:04:50,820 --> 01:04:53,152
<i>We embark next week.</i>

811
01:04:53,222 --> 01:04:57,921
Men need war like the soil
needs turning. I'll enjoy it!

812
01:04:57,994 --> 01:04:59,962
You're surely not going
over there in your condition?

813
01:05:00,029 --> 01:05:03,021
Of course I'm going!
Why should the men have all the fun?

814
01:05:03,099 --> 01:05:06,466
And didn't Eleanor of Aquitaine ride
into battle pregnant and bare-breasted?

815
01:05:06,535 --> 01:05:09,971
<i>By Gad, if there's a woman alive
who could do the same, it's you.!</i>

816
01:05:10,039 --> 01:05:12,564
<i>Be careful of the model, Mrs. Crawley.</i>

817
01:05:12,642 --> 01:05:15,133
Queen Eleanor was
locked up by her husband.

818
01:05:15,211 --> 01:05:17,645
And emerged from her prison
to govern England.

819
01:05:17,713 --> 01:05:20,273
Bravo.

820
01:05:20,349 --> 01:05:24,342
What about you, Sedders? Will you
be joining us on our little excursion?

821
01:05:24,420 --> 01:05:27,548
<i>If it weren't for my duties in India,
I'd be over there like a shot. Oh yes.!</i>

822
01:05:31,527 --> 01:05:34,018
- I'll go.
- You cannot.

823
01:05:34,096 --> 01:05:38,533
<i>Well, why shouldn't she?
She can keep Becky company.</i>

824
01:05:38,601 --> 01:05:41,900
- To victory!
- Victory!

825
01:05:41,971 --> 01:05:44,804
- Victory!
- To victory.

826
01:05:54,984 --> 01:05:58,010
We won't know anyone.
Whose fault is that?

827
01:05:58,087 --> 01:06:01,147
If you would only put yourself out
to be civil once in a while.

828
01:06:01,223 --> 01:06:04,488
The Crawleys have been here
no longer than us, and Mrs. Crawley's
the talk of the town.

829
01:06:04,560 --> 01:06:08,326
Is that what you would have me be,
the "talk of the town"?

830
01:06:45,968 --> 01:06:49,233
<i>Here comes the famous Mrs. Crawley.</i>

831
01:06:49,305 --> 01:06:51,364
<i>Why she is famous
is a mystery to me.</i>

832
01:06:51,440 --> 01:06:55,206
Why does everyone receive her,
as for General Tufto?

833
01:06:55,277 --> 01:06:58,303
<i>He must find her
command of French useful.</i>

834
01:06:58,381 --> 01:07:02,340
<i>- I know I should.
- A real lady wouldn't speak it half as well.</i>

835
01:07:02,418 --> 01:07:06,684
- Hush, my dear.
- Lady Darlington. Lady Bareacres.

836
01:07:06,756 --> 01:07:09,384
Good evening, Mrs. Crawley.
Good evening.

837
01:07:09,458 --> 01:07:13,417
You're making an exhibition of yourself.

838
01:07:26,409 --> 01:07:30,072
Good evening.
Good evening.

839
01:07:34,016 --> 01:07:38,476
Can I leave you in charge?
I see some sheep that need shearing.

840
01:07:38,554 --> 01:07:41,352
Go. You manage our income,
and I'll see to your career.

841
01:07:41,424 --> 01:07:43,415
Wait here a minute.

842
01:07:44,427 --> 01:07:46,588
George, I feel... I feel sick.

843
01:07:46,662 --> 01:07:48,926
General Tufto.
Mrs. Crawley.

844
01:07:48,998 --> 01:07:52,434
Can I tempt you
with some refreshment?
That would be delightful.

845
01:08:02,745 --> 01:08:04,679
Mrs. Crawley.
Yes, good evening.

846
01:08:04,747 --> 01:08:06,840
I hope your dance card
isn't quite filled yet.

847
01:08:06,916 --> 01:08:09,714
- Hardly. I've just arrived.
- I am the early bird, then.

848
01:08:09,785 --> 01:08:12,219
<i>And I, presumably, the worm?</i>

849
01:08:12,288 --> 01:08:17,055
General Tufto, this is
Captain Osborne of the Ninth.

850
01:08:17,126 --> 01:08:19,686
That is Osborne with an "E."
Make sure you spell it right...

851
01:08:19,762 --> 01:08:21,753
when you mention him
in dispatches.

852
01:08:21,831 --> 01:08:24,994
If only spelling
was my forte.

853
01:08:28,571 --> 01:08:31,802
My dear, please.
Thank you.

854
01:09:09,145 --> 01:09:13,479
Would you like me to fetch you
some water? Or a chair?

855
01:09:13,549 --> 01:09:15,540
Or a doctor?

856
01:09:15,618 --> 01:09:18,382
Is Amelia all right?

857
01:09:18,454 --> 01:09:21,116
<i>I expect so. Dobbin's with her.</i>

858
01:09:21,190 --> 01:09:24,250
Shouldn't you have more care of her now?

859
01:09:24,326 --> 01:09:27,454
You mean, now that yet another
rope has come to bind me?

860
01:09:33,769 --> 01:09:35,760
You're not like Amelia, Mrs. Crawley.

861
01:09:37,540 --> 01:09:40,134
Nothing will quench your fire.

862
01:09:48,684 --> 01:09:51,278
Captain Osborne.

863
01:09:51,353 --> 01:09:53,583
Will you fetch me
my shawl and my nosegay?

864
01:09:54,723 --> 01:09:56,953
Of course.

865
01:10:05,701 --> 01:10:10,001
I wish you'd let me come with you.
No. I mean it. Go back at once.

866
01:10:10,072 --> 01:10:12,563
I'll tell George you're safe.
Don't.

867
01:10:12,641 --> 01:10:15,838
It will only annoy him
that I've left the ball early.

868
01:10:15,911 --> 01:10:18,345
But why did he bring you at all?

869
01:10:20,149 --> 01:10:22,515
Just tell me you're happy.

870
01:10:24,787 --> 01:10:27,312
We're happy enough.

871
01:10:39,902 --> 01:10:42,666
How prettily the Duchess
has arranged things.

872
01:10:42,738 --> 01:10:47,437
She always does. Or don't you go
to her parties back in England?

873
01:10:48,577 --> 01:10:50,909
No matter. We won't
know her back in London.

874
01:11:06,262 --> 01:11:09,663
- I see you've been busy.
- Very.

875
01:11:12,434 --> 01:11:14,561
Osborne.
Crawley.

876
01:11:14,637 --> 01:11:16,571
Ready for a hand
or two of cards?

877
01:11:16,639 --> 01:11:20,268
- If Mrs. Crawley...
- Of course.

878
01:11:30,919 --> 01:11:33,581
I'll leave you to it, gentlemen.

879
01:11:40,596 --> 01:11:44,999
<i>- George, don't drink anymore.
- Nonsense, Dobbs.</i>

880
01:11:45,067 --> 01:11:48,503
Come and have a drink yourself,
and light up your lantern jaw.

881
01:11:54,310 --> 01:11:58,110
<i>What's happening?</i>
