1
00:01:08,768 --> 00:01:10,135
Hi. Did you miss me?

2
00:01:10,137 --> 00:01:12,104
No. Not at all.

3
00:01:12,106 --> 00:01:13,705
I'll take that as a compliment.

4
00:01:13,707 --> 00:01:15,707
It's okay. You won't lose any
            data.

5
00:01:15,709 --> 00:01:17,509
It's on somebody's cloud.

6
00:01:17,511 --> 00:01:18,777
Oh my god.

7
00:01:18,779 --> 00:01:20,579
Ah, control click the package.

8
00:01:20,581 --> 00:01:22,514
The collections were tragic.

9
00:01:22,516 --> 00:01:23,549
 We can only hope our customers

10
00:01:23,551 --> 00:01:26,018
    are as color-blind as
        our designers.

11
00:01:26,020 --> 00:01:27,386
It's hidden in the installer.

12
00:01:27,388 --> 00:01:28,454
Hold on. That's my sitter, Jill.

13
00:01:28,456 --> 00:01:29,154
Ya.

14
00:01:29,156 --> 00:01:31,190
Hi Jill! How's Laila?

15
00:01:31,192 --> 00:01:33,058
She didn't bite anyone did she?

16
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:34,359
    Uh-uh-hold on, this is
      my-my-assistant.

17
00:01:34,361 --> 00:01:35,260
        Oh my God yeah.

18
00:01:35,262 --> 00:01:36,662
The models were fat.

19
00:01:36,664 --> 00:01:38,697
They said they were healthy, but
        they were fat.

20
00:01:38,699 --> 00:01:40,499
Uh...you control click it.

21
00:01:40,501 --> 00:01:42,201
 It's the key that says CTRL.
         It's on the-

22
00:01:42,203 --> 00:01:45,504
Oh my God! That is
         disgusting!

23
00:01:45,506 --> 00:01:47,172
A package is actually a folder.

24
00:01:47,174 --> 00:01:49,641
Yeah, they do that to
      make it simple...

25
00:01:49,643 --> 00:01:51,376
but it's always hard to explain
             it.

26
00:01:51,378 --> 00:01:55,214
Oh my God. That is so cute. I
       can't stand it.

27
00:01:55,216 --> 00:01:59,618
- Wait a minute. Oh no.
- Are you brushing your teeth!?

28
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:01,153
Do not say that
            again!

29
00:02:01,155 --> 00:02:07,893
Hold on Luis, that's my sitter
 again. Hey, Jill what's up?

30
00:02:08,495 --> 00:02:10,329
Well, the
  installer image is inside.

31
00:02:10,331 --> 00:02:14,666
About 8 giga-

32
00:02:14,668 --> 00:02:15,834
- Okay. I can hear you.
- Sorry.

33
00:02:15,836 --> 00:02:17,136
Hi.

34
00:02:17,138 --> 00:02:18,604
Wait, wait, wait. It's not on
          the cloud?

35
00:02:18,606 --> 00:02:23,642
Oh boy. Okay, you need
     to back it up first.
You know I told
             you-

36
00:02:23,644 --> 00:02:27,446
and I don't really want to
   talk about it...again.
Probably take three or
        four hours...

37
00:02:27,448 --> 00:02:32,084
    you know...and...yeah,
        uh, do that--

38
00:02:32,086 --> 00:02:34,086
I know she does. I know...

39
00:02:34,088 --> 00:02:37,322
    but I'm a mom and moms
           worry...

40
00:02:37,324 --> 00:02:42,895
...ugh, nothing. I'll see you in
            a bit.

41
00:02:59,112 --> 00:03:01,880
How was fashion week?

42
00:03:01,882 --> 00:03:03,682
Good.

43
00:03:05,351 --> 00:03:07,819
Good.

44
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:27,839
- Hiiii! Hi, Laila! Ohhhhhh.
- You're so excited to see Mommy!

45
00:03:27,841 --> 00:03:31,210
Oh, ho, ho! You missed
         Mommy, huh?

46
00:03:31,212 --> 00:03:34,846
Oh, Caramel kisses,
    gimme caramel kisses!

47
00:03:37,418 --> 00:03:40,219
Oh, poor girl. I missed you too.

48
00:03:40,221 --> 00:03:43,589
Ah. We went to the park and the
  post office, the movies--

49
00:03:43,591 --> 00:03:44,756
The movies?

50
00:03:44,758 --> 00:03:47,893
It's freezing in there. Did you
     put her sweater on?

51
00:03:47,895 --> 00:03:50,696
Yes, but she didn't like
          it so I--

52
00:03:50,698 --> 00:03:52,898
Jill. She needs her
           sweater.

53
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:54,666
Isn't that what her fur is for?

54
00:03:54,668 --> 00:03:56,268
Uhhh, Here ya go.

55
00:03:56,270 --> 00:03:58,270
You know, it feels weird taking
         money for...

56
00:03:58,272 --> 00:03:59,738
   hanging out with my BFF,
          maybe...

57
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:02,975
    I could just stay for
        dinner... or?

58
00:04:03,676 --> 00:04:04,610
Uh...

59
00:04:04,612 --> 00:04:06,912
Uh, Abby has a client dinner.

60
00:04:06,914 --> 00:04:11,183
Oh. 'Kay.

61
00:04:11,185 --> 00:04:14,586
I will see you tomorrow night.
         Bye Littles.

62
00:04:14,588 --> 00:04:15,887
Her name is Laila.

63
00:04:15,889 --> 00:04:18,423
She looks more like a Littles.

64
00:04:20,727 --> 00:04:22,628
How long you been driving on
         that spare?

65
00:04:22,630 --> 00:04:25,530
About a month. Bye!

66
00:04:26,566 --> 00:04:28,467
House number two is a fixer
 upper just outside the city.

67
00:04:28,469 --> 00:04:29,901
Oh, that place is disgusting.

68
00:04:29,903 --> 00:04:31,236
Is that mold?

69
00:04:31,238 --> 00:04:32,971
It's gotta be.

70
00:04:32,973 --> 00:04:35,540
They're never gonna pick house
             two.

71
00:04:35,542 --> 00:04:36,842
Mmm.

72
00:04:38,312 --> 00:04:39,911
Terrible location.

73
00:04:41,414 --> 00:04:43,382
Hey, Kat. What's up?

74
00:04:43,384 --> 00:04:45,417
You guys want to grab
     a bite at Julio's?

75
00:04:45,419 --> 00:04:47,452
    Two for one margaritas!

76
00:04:47,454 --> 00:04:49,454
They don't allow dogs.

77
00:04:49,456 --> 00:04:51,323
Okay. How about
       Chutney Palace?

78
00:04:52,326 --> 00:04:54,259
Laila doesn't like Indian.

79
00:04:54,261 --> 00:04:55,661
I think we're just  gonna stay
             in.

80
00:04:55,663 --> 00:04:56,561
Bye, bitch!

81
00:04:56,563 --> 00:04:58,764
Bye, bitch!

82
00:05:01,734 --> 00:05:03,602
     Oh, I want that house.

83
00:05:15,481 --> 00:05:18,850
You're squishing Laila.

84
00:05:18,852 --> 00:05:20,919
Sorry.

85
00:05:22,855 --> 00:05:27,392
Don't! She's tired.

86
00:05:27,394 --> 00:05:29,795
Sorry.

87
00:05:38,605 --> 00:05:40,639
Make some noise for fuck's sake!

88
00:05:51,017 --> 00:05:53,952
Kent.

89
00:06:01,627 --> 00:06:05,030
I love you so much.

90
00:06:09,736 --> 00:06:12,671
So you're cool with
        being friends?

91
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:15,440
Wh--?

92
00:06:15,442 --> 00:06:16,808
Wait. You're still breaking up
           with me?

93
00:06:16,810 --> 00:06:22,981
Whoa. Whoa, whoa. We were
never officially together, so.

94
00:06:22,983 --> 00:06:24,716
   And I mean if you think
          about it..

95
00:06:24,718 --> 00:06:27,085
It's a good thing we didn't get
    too involved you know?

96
00:06:27,087 --> 00:06:28,553
    Woulda been much harder.

97
00:06:28,555 --> 00:06:32,557
But, you're on the lease.

98
00:06:32,559 --> 00:06:34,893
I got a new lease.

99
00:06:34,895 --> 00:06:41,032
Awww. You love these NON-GMO
  biscuits. Yeah. Good Girl.

100
00:06:41,034 --> 00:06:45,971
Give mama your face
and wipe your mouffy. Good girl.

101
00:06:45,973 --> 00:06:47,672
What are my girls up to today?

102
00:06:47,674 --> 00:06:49,541
We're hittin' the
         doggy park.

103
00:06:49,543 --> 00:06:53,879
    We're gonna see Bernie
the pug, and Oliver the Westie,

104
00:06:53,881 --> 00:06:56,715
and Sage the Beagle, and their
           mommies.

105
00:06:56,717 --> 00:06:59,618
You two. Need to make a baby.

106
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:02,487
We're not ready
          for that.

107
00:07:02,489 --> 00:07:04,589
Bye.

108
00:07:18,805 --> 00:07:22,140
Bob wants to see you in his
           office.

109
00:07:40,427 --> 00:07:44,095
Mhmm

110
00:08:00,813 --> 00:08:03,915
Mhmm.

111
00:08:06,053 --> 00:08:06,952
             I uh--

112
00:08:06,954 --> 00:08:10,622
I got you something.

113
00:08:13,092 --> 00:08:14,793
 It's a USB coffee mug warmer.

114
00:08:14,795 --> 00:08:17,462
You plug it into your USB port
           and it--

115
00:08:17,464 --> 00:08:18,797
keeps it warm

116
00:08:18,799 --> 00:08:20,632
Oh.

117
00:08:20,634 --> 00:08:26,471
Mmmm, mmm, mmm.

118
00:08:27,874 --> 00:08:32,544
Listen, Jill. Ahhh, it's been
           great...

119
00:08:32,546 --> 00:08:34,579
  having you with us for the
       last few months.

120
00:08:34,581 --> 00:08:35,881
Thank you so much,

121
00:08:35,883 --> 00:08:39,217
I-I really enjoy working here
     everyone's just so,

122
00:08:39,219 --> 00:08:40,819
so nice.

123
00:08:40,821 --> 00:08:43,154
We're cutting back on our temps.

124
00:08:43,156 --> 00:08:48,560
D-down-sizing, economy and all,
            uh...

125
00:08:48,562 --> 00:08:54,766
 we're gonna have to let you
go. I'm sor-I'm so-I'm sorry.

126
00:08:56,836 --> 00:08:59,604
But, this is where I work.

127
00:08:59,606 --> 00:09:01,606
Well, not anymore.

128
00:09:24,231 --> 00:09:26,131
They really love their dog.

129
00:09:26,133 --> 00:09:28,166
- They love that dog too much.
- Jesus Christ.

130
00:09:28,168 --> 00:09:30,235
Is that thing wearing
           a tutu?

131
00:09:30,237 --> 00:09:31,970
Cute Christmas Card.

132
00:09:31,972 --> 00:09:36,708
Kaaaaaat!!! What's up
           bitch!
What's up
            bitch!

133
00:09:36,710 --> 00:09:39,010
I'm so glad you're here it's a
    snooze fest in there.

134
00:09:39,012 --> 00:09:40,178
Good thing you didn't
       come to Julio's.

135
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:41,813
     I'm still shit faced.

136
00:09:41,815 --> 00:09:43,982
Do you have any coconut water?

137
00:09:43,984 --> 00:09:45,884
    Who-ooo. love the dress!

138
00:09:45,886 --> 00:09:48,620
Thank you. I made it
out of a pair of Eliott's pants.

139
00:09:48,622 --> 00:09:50,288
What?! If you don't create your
     own clothing line...

140
00:09:50,290 --> 00:09:52,557
  you should be convicted of
   crimes against humanity.

141
00:09:52,559 --> 00:09:57,729
You guys can put your
     shoes in the basket.

142
00:09:57,731 --> 00:10:00,065
I know the rule, Eliott.

143
00:10:00,067 --> 00:10:03,535
Wow. Rambo! What have you been
            doin'?

144
00:10:03,537 --> 00:10:04,736
A little yoga.

145
00:10:04,738 --> 00:10:08,540
Devon, this is Abby and her
       husband Eliott.

146
00:10:08,542 --> 00:10:10,609
Hi. How ya doin'?

147
00:10:10,611 --> 00:10:12,877
How's it goin' uh...? Where's
           the bar?

148
00:10:12,879 --> 00:10:17,282
Uhhhhh, yeah it's over, yeah
       it's, follow me.

149
00:10:18,584 --> 00:10:19,751
Oh my god, bitch.

150
00:10:19,753 --> 00:10:21,052
That's what I'm talkin' about.

151
00:10:21,054 --> 00:10:22,954
Wh -what happened to
       what's his name?

152
00:10:22,956 --> 00:10:25,090
He found my driver's licence.

153
00:10:25,092 --> 00:10:26,324
 I got this for you at Julio's.

154
00:10:26,326 --> 00:10:28,660
Ew! I hate Sangria.

155
00:10:28,662 --> 00:10:31,262
Oh, my gosh. I'm so sorry I'm
            late.

156
00:10:31,264 --> 00:10:34,165
     They had this worker
 appreciation thing for me.

157
00:10:34,167 --> 00:10:37,202
You know, they gave me a plaque
     with my name on it!

158
00:10:37,204 --> 00:10:38,603
Of course Kent wanted to take me
     out to celebrate...

159
00:10:38,605 --> 00:10:40,238
  so I had to go. He loves me.

160
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:43,308
Laila's in the office and she
   almost got stepped on.

161
00:10:43,310 --> 00:10:45,777
Oh, my God. Laila. Laila!

162
00:10:45,779 --> 00:10:47,679
1993's calling.

163
00:10:47,681 --> 00:10:49,781
It wants it's pink dress back!

164
00:10:50,784 --> 00:10:52,017
Do you wanna hold her?

165
00:10:52,019 --> 00:10:53,852
No.

166
00:10:54,788 --> 00:10:59,024
I-I mean, I better not.

167
00:10:59,026 --> 00:11:00,725
 Do you have to say no babies?

168
00:11:00,727 --> 00:11:01,826
What was that?!

169
00:11:03,163 --> 00:11:05,930
Oh, God. Hurry!

170
00:11:05,932 --> 00:11:08,900
This is so great. You
    guys gotta watch this.

00:11:08,902 --> 00:11:10,869

172
00:11:10,871 --> 00:11:11,836

00:11:11,838 --> 00:11:15,373
Good girl! Good girl! Good girl!

174
00:11:17,109 --> 00:11:19,277
Everyone.

175
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:21,813
We have an announcement to make.

176
00:11:21,815 --> 00:11:25,083
Some of you know already, but we
  were waiting until it was

177
00:11:25,085 --> 00:11:27,018
confirmed to share the news with
       the rest of you.

178
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:28,186
You're pregnant!

179
00:11:29,056 --> 00:11:31,289
Congrats!, That's so
          exciting!

180
00:11:31,291 --> 00:11:33,625
Noooo.

181
00:11:33,627 --> 00:11:37,262
  Eliott has been promoted to
      Vice-President...

182
00:11:37,264 --> 00:11:40,398
of Nerd-dom at Marina Tech in-

183
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:41,933
We're moving to San
          Francisco.

184
00:11:41,935 --> 00:11:44,369
San Franciso!!! WhooHoooo!

185
00:11:44,371 --> 00:11:47,839
Get the fuck out of here
that's great! Congratulations!

186
00:11:47,841 --> 00:11:50,809
San Franciso!!! WhooHoooo!

187
00:12:06,192 --> 00:12:08,893
I got fired today.

188
00:12:15,735 --> 00:12:20,839
  I got fired today. I can't
    believe I got fired.

189
00:12:20,841 --> 00:12:24,743
   They kept Ephraim and he
    misfiles everything.

190
00:12:24,745 --> 00:12:27,312
  He filed Watermaker before
         Wasserstein.

191
00:12:27,314 --> 00:12:29,814
He's always late to work and he
takes two hour lunch breaks and

192
00:12:29,816 --> 00:12:31,182
   the only reason he works
         so quickly

193
00:12:31,184 --> 00:12:34,385
 is because he's hopped up on
            meth.

194
00:12:34,387 --> 00:12:38,289
They fired the girl who never
     forgets a birthday.

195
00:12:38,291 --> 00:12:44,729
Who works overtime for free! Who
   hand painted one hundred

196
00:12:44,731 --> 00:12:48,967
 "I heart my co-worker" coffee
  mugs for Valentines day.

197
00:12:48,969 --> 00:12:51,903
 And now my BFF is moving away!

198
00:12:51,905 --> 00:12:58,009
   It's not fair. It's not
          faaaaair!

199
00:12:58,011 --> 00:12:59,077
Bye, bitch.

200
00:12:59,079 --> 00:13:02,814
Bye, bitch. I'm drunk.

201
00:13:02,816 --> 00:13:03,948
Bye, Eliott.

202
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:05,150
Bye.

203
00:13:05,152 --> 00:13:07,452
Byee. Bye pretty boy.

204
00:13:10,490 --> 00:13:13,725
I can't find my other shoe.

205
00:13:13,727 --> 00:13:14,893
Here, I'll help you.

206
00:13:16,997 --> 00:13:20,131
 It just vanished. Just Whoosh!

207
00:13:23,403 --> 00:13:26,004
    It's been such a hard
         couple days.

208
00:13:26,006 --> 00:13:32,811
I...I lost my job and I lost my
boyfriend and I got my period.

209
00:13:32,813 --> 00:13:34,479
Okay. I'll make up the couch.

210
00:13:34,481 --> 00:13:36,181
Come on. Oh!

211
00:13:36,183 --> 00:13:41,786
Ohhh. You guys are so sweet. I'm
    sorry I lost my shoe.

212
00:13:41,788 --> 00:13:48,393
Thank you. I'm just gonna miss
         her so much.

213
00:13:48,395 --> 00:13:51,462
I know.

214
00:13:51,464 --> 00:13:53,832
Would you like to keep her at
 your house until Wednesday?

215
00:13:53,834 --> 00:13:55,033
Yeah, it would really
          help us.

216
00:13:55,035 --> 00:13:57,035
  Uh, we're gonna be moving
and she'll be under our feet--

217
00:13:57,037 --> 00:14:00,438
Are you serious?! I'd love to.

218
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:02,273
    Well, did you hear that?

219
00:14:02,275 --> 00:14:05,009
    You're comin' to camp
        Jill, Littles.

220
00:14:05,011 --> 00:14:06,511
It's Laila

221
00:14:06,513 --> 00:14:08,079
Mhmm.

222
00:14:10,916 --> 00:14:15,086
Here's her snack bag and her wee
          wee pads.

223
00:14:15,088 --> 00:14:17,789
    Make sure you have her
          blankie.

224
00:14:17,791 --> 00:14:19,557
You have the 24 hour emergency
      vet number, right?

225
00:14:19,559 --> 00:14:20,992
Don't worry.

226
00:14:20,994 --> 00:14:24,329
Everything will be fine, she'll
       be safe with me.

227
00:14:24,331 --> 00:14:26,197
Byeee.

228
00:14:29,935 --> 00:14:32,036
 Call me if you need anything!

229
00:14:32,038 --> 00:14:34,172
I will!

230
00:14:34,174 --> 00:14:36,274
Bye!

231
00:14:36,276 --> 00:14:37,075
Bye.

232
00:14:37,077 --> 00:14:42,080
Let's get this ugly sweater off
         of you, huh?

233
00:14:42,082 --> 00:14:44,883
ohhhhh!

234
00:14:49,121 --> 00:14:52,957
  Oh my gosh, you know who's
     engaged this week?

235
00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:56,594
Should I get engaged?

236
00:15:02,502 --> 00:15:05,570
This is called Juicy Glow.

237
00:15:25,157 --> 00:15:26,958
Do you want to stay and watch TV
   with me tonight, Shelby?

238
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:29,260
No.

239
00:15:29,262 --> 00:15:30,061
Please Shelby?

240
00:15:30,063 --> 00:15:32,263
No!

241
00:15:32,265 --> 00:15:34,032
'Kay.

242
00:15:35,868 --> 00:15:39,037
How much longer do you think?
Because, well, last time you...

243
00:15:39,039 --> 00:15:41,372
didn't leave them in long enough
an-and it didn't really look any

244
00:15:41,374 --> 00:15:45,476
different, and, oh, Kent really
      loves highlights.

245
00:15:45,478 --> 00:15:48,046
Five minutes for you.

246
00:15:48,048 --> 00:15:50,515
       Three for the dog.

247
00:15:53,218 --> 00:15:58,957
Ya know, if you really want 'im
           back...

248
00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:02,727
 you outta let me bleach your
           asshole.

249
00:16:30,389 --> 00:16:32,523
How'd you find me?

250
00:16:32,525 --> 00:16:34,258
Your mom told me.

251
00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:37,662
 You know, she's really upset
 we're not together anymore.

252
00:16:37,664 --> 00:16:40,264
Well, I'm kind of working,
   so... What do you want?

253
00:16:40,266 --> 00:16:42,467
Um, well, you left this in
         my fridge...

254
00:16:42,469 --> 00:16:44,235
   and I thought you might
      miss it 'cause...

255
00:16:44,237 --> 00:16:46,371
 I know you love it an-and I
     don't really eat it,

256
00:16:46,373 --> 00:16:49,974
so...

257
00:16:49,976 --> 00:16:56,481
Well, where's my hot sauce? Been
        missin' that.

258
00:16:56,483 --> 00:17:01,953
Why did you leave me? You never
          said why.

259
00:17:01,955 --> 00:17:04,155
Because you wanted me to stay.

260
00:17:19,505 --> 00:17:22,373
It's 1:30. Where is she?

261
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:58,076
What's she doing out there?

262
00:18:04,651 --> 00:18:06,017
Jill?

263
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:08,619
Jill, what's wrong?

264
00:18:08,621 --> 00:18:12,590
Jill, please roll down
         the window.

265
00:18:12,592 --> 00:18:17,195
Jill, roll it down.

266
00:18:17,197 --> 00:18:20,565
Where's Laila? Jill?

267
00:18:20,567 --> 00:18:21,666
Jill, roll your window down!

268
00:18:21,668 --> 00:18:22,567
Jill!

269
00:18:22,569 --> 00:18:26,771
Open the door! Open this door
    and talk to me! Jill!

270
00:18:26,773 --> 00:18:29,373
Where's Laila? Where is Laila?!

271
00:18:29,375 --> 00:18:30,174
Answer her! Jill!

272
00:18:30,176 --> 00:18:31,676
Where-is-Laila?! Jill!

273
00:18:31,678 --> 00:18:35,213
Where's Laila?! Where's Laila?!
Where is Laila?! Where's Laila?!

274
00:18:35,215 --> 00:18:37,482
Where is Laila?! Where is she?!

275
00:18:37,484 --> 00:18:40,118
You let me in this car now!

276
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:44,455
Where-is-she?! Open
that door! Where's Lai-Laaaa?!

277
00:18:44,457 --> 00:18:47,692
Goooooooone!!!

278
00:18:48,628 --> 00:18:50,428
Abby!

279
00:18:50,430 --> 00:18:52,663
What we have here is a canine
          emergency.

280
00:18:52,665 --> 00:18:55,099
     Get your flyers and
      plaster the area.

281
00:18:55,101 --> 00:18:56,667
Who's got West Valley bike path?

282
00:18:56,669 --> 00:19:00,505
Sir. Yes, Sir!

283
00:19:00,507 --> 00:19:02,240
I need your eyes and ears on me
           people.

284
00:19:04,177 --> 00:19:06,410
Sandwich?

285
00:19:06,412 --> 00:19:07,445
What kind?

286
00:19:07,447 --> 00:19:09,213
It's meat Senorita.

287
00:19:11,317 --> 00:19:12,683
This is a code red.

288
00:19:12,685 --> 00:19:13,784
Ooh, sandwiches.

289
00:19:13,786 --> 00:19:17,788
What time were you at
        the dog park?

290
00:19:17,790 --> 00:19:23,094
Uh, the afternoon, between 12
          and 12:42?

291
00:19:23,096 --> 00:19:25,329
Can you be more specific?!

292
00:19:25,331 --> 00:19:27,832
I told you already. They
  took her at the dog park.

293
00:19:27,834 --> 00:19:29,667
How many more times do I have
         to tell you?

294
00:19:29,669 --> 00:19:31,335
As many times as it takes!

295
00:19:31,337 --> 00:19:33,704
She was kidnapped at Laurel
       Park, Officer.

296
00:19:33,706 --> 00:19:36,340
Has there been a ransom
           demand?

297
00:19:36,342 --> 00:19:42,313
No! He wants to know what the
    kidnapper looked like.

298
00:19:42,315 --> 00:19:43,481
What were you doing when she was
            taken?

299
00:19:43,483 --> 00:19:45,449
I'm speaking. What did he look
            like?

300
00:19:45,451 --> 00:19:46,584
Were you drinking?!

301
00:19:46,586 --> 00:19:50,621
Um-uh-He was-over 6 feet tall,
            uh...

302
00:19:50,623 --> 00:19:55,159
medium toned skin, 30's and uh,
  he had an anchor tattoo...

303
00:19:55,161 --> 00:19:58,829
on his bicep and just beady eyes
       and wild hair...

304
00:19:58,831 --> 00:20:01,399
an-and he was missing his left
            thumb.

305
00:20:01,401 --> 00:20:05,336
I was picking up her doody and I
 looked away for one second.

306
00:20:05,338 --> 00:20:06,470
          One second!

307
00:20:06,472 --> 00:20:09,874
He wants to know what she was
           wearing.

308
00:20:09,876 --> 00:20:13,277
Nothing. Well, it was hot so I
    took off her sweater.

309
00:20:13,279 --> 00:20:15,880
Why do you keep doing that? She
      loves her sweater.

310
00:20:15,882 --> 00:20:19,650
I am so sorry,
     I will do anything.

311
00:20:19,652 --> 00:20:21,485
She wasn't wearing anything,
          Officer.

312
00:20:21,487 --> 00:20:24,855
   The babysitter said she
 was more comfortable naked.

313
00:20:24,857 --> 00:20:27,225
  Please tell me she had her
          collar on.

314
00:20:27,227 --> 00:20:29,393
Well of course she had her
          collar on.

315
00:20:29,395 --> 00:20:30,461
Collar?!

316
00:20:30,463 --> 00:20:34,865
Ma'am are we talking
  about a dog, or a person?

317
00:20:34,867 --> 00:20:37,668
A person! She won't even eat dog
            food.

318
00:20:37,670 --> 00:20:39,737
   Tell me what kind of dog
           that is?

319
00:20:39,739 --> 00:20:41,205
Spoiled.

320
00:20:42,375 --> 00:20:43,541
I think I'm going to be sick.

321
00:20:43,543 --> 00:20:44,909
Oh.

322
00:20:49,548 --> 00:20:53,551
If he wants money...
 why hasn't he contacted us?

323
00:20:53,553 --> 00:20:55,186
He will.

324
00:20:55,188 --> 00:20:59,957
That's him! That's him.

325
00:21:08,333 --> 00:21:11,802
Oh, no. Someone lost Perro
           Perdido.

326
00:21:11,804 --> 00:21:13,638
Ay, Dios mio.

327
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:16,741
Our dog is missing. Have you
 seen her? Her name's Laila.

328
00:21:17,909 --> 00:21:19,210
Laila?

329
00:21:19,212 --> 00:21:23,781
Honey, Honey, no, no,
 that's not Laila. No. Sorry.

330
00:21:23,783 --> 00:21:26,617
Laila!!! Laila!!!

331
00:21:26,619 --> 00:21:31,422
      Laila! Laila! Laila!

332
00:21:31,424 --> 00:21:36,294
  Laila! Laila! We love you,
        Laila! Laila!

333
00:21:39,765 --> 00:21:41,465
Oh, my God.

334
00:21:41,467 --> 00:21:43,634
Her D'Ugg

335
00:21:49,741 --> 00:21:51,375
      We're losing light.

336
00:22:00,886 --> 00:22:03,020
Awwwww

337
00:22:31,417 --> 00:22:33,784
Get it!

338
00:22:34,953 --> 00:22:40,691
Hello. Yes, it is.

339
00:22:40,693 --> 00:22:44,862
No... I don't want my phone line
       over broadband.

340
00:22:44,864 --> 00:22:45,796
Hang up!

341
00:22:45,798 --> 00:22:47,465
Six months? No commitment?

342
00:22:47,467 --> 00:22:51,902
I don't care! The kidnapper
 might be trying to call us!

343
00:23:02,013 --> 00:23:03,481
I have your dog.

344
00:23:03,483 --> 00:23:04,815
Oh, Jesus.

345
00:23:04,817 --> 00:23:06,617
If you want to get your dog back

346
00:23:06,619 --> 00:23:09,754
do not contact the police, or
        she will die.

347
00:23:09,756 --> 00:23:12,723
Do not contact the FBI...

348
00:23:12,725 --> 00:23:17,828
or she will die. Do not contact
Cesar Milan, or she will die.

349
00:23:17,830 --> 00:23:21,799
Do not think you can outsmart
     me. I have a degree.

350
00:23:21,801 --> 00:23:24,001
Place thirty thousand dollars...

351
00:23:24,003 --> 00:23:26,570
in unmarked bills in a duffle
            bag.

352
00:23:26,572 --> 00:23:30,775
The drop off will be tomorrow
  night,10 pm at the quarry.

353
00:23:30,777 --> 00:23:32,343
Laila.

354
00:23:32,345 --> 00:23:37,348
Do not be late, or she will die.

355
00:23:37,350 --> 00:23:39,583
There's a quarry in LA?

356
00:23:39,585 --> 00:23:40,484
I'm calling the police.

357
00:23:40,486 --> 00:23:45,823
Are you crazy? He'll kill her.

358
00:23:45,825 --> 00:23:48,459
         What do we do?

359
00:23:55,368 --> 00:23:57,401
If you hadn't found Jill on
        Greg's list...

360
00:23:57,403 --> 00:23:59,870
    this never would have
          happened.

361
00:23:59,872 --> 00:24:04,375
She babysat her for a year. It
 coulda happened to anybody!

362
00:24:04,377 --> 00:24:10,448
But it didn't. It happened with
    her and you hired her!

363
00:24:10,450 --> 00:24:15,453
You don't know how that makes me
            feel.

364
00:24:15,455 --> 00:24:18,556
You don't know how I feel.

365
00:24:18,558 --> 00:24:23,160
What?! I'm the one in pain here.

366
00:24:24,030 --> 00:24:26,030
This sucks.

367
00:24:26,032 --> 00:24:29,900
I'm the one in real pain.

368
00:24:38,077 --> 00:24:41,679
It places the lotion in the
           basket.

369
00:24:44,416 --> 00:24:48,018
     No! The lotion goes
        in the basket!

370
00:24:49,654 --> 00:24:52,156
  You spoiled, fucking Bitch.

371
00:25:07,506 --> 00:25:08,472
I can't believe you
       made me drive...

372
00:25:08,474 --> 00:25:11,675
 all the way to Silverlake to
        return a shoe.

373
00:25:11,677 --> 00:25:15,079
What's Jill going to do with one
            shoe?

374
00:25:17,782 --> 00:25:20,150
Hey there she is.

375
00:25:20,152 --> 00:25:23,087
With Laila.

376
00:25:23,089 --> 00:25:24,522
       Abby and Eliott
        What the Fu--

377
00:25:30,795 --> 00:25:31,762
Hey, guys!

378
00:25:31,764 --> 00:25:32,863
Where is she?

379
00:25:32,865 --> 00:25:34,131
Oh, my shoe!

380
00:25:34,133 --> 00:25:37,201
We know you kidnapped Laila!

381
00:25:38,704 --> 00:25:45,009
Owwww!! Ohhh Goddd,
           owwwww!!

382
00:25:45,011 --> 00:25:46,010
       Where did she go?!

383
00:25:46,012 --> 00:25:46,977
She locked the door!

384
00:25:51,917 --> 00:25:53,884
    Ohhh, no, no, no wait.

385
00:25:53,886 --> 00:25:56,053
 Wait, we have your money. We
       have your money!

386
00:26:02,895 --> 00:26:06,830
I'm gonna to kill you! Jill!!!

387
00:26:08,233 --> 00:26:10,734
Oh! Watch out! Watch out! Outta
          the way!

388
00:26:10,736 --> 00:26:13,938
    Outta the way! Laila!
       Lailaaaaaaa!!!!

389
00:26:17,243 --> 00:26:20,644
Here's your fucking shoe!

390
00:26:22,147 --> 00:26:30,821
Oh, my God. You think you know
          somebody.

391
00:26:31,222 --> 00:26:33,524
You don't think she made her go
           in this?

392
00:26:33,526 --> 00:26:34,959
How much money?

393
00:26:34,961 --> 00:26:35,960
Thirty grand.

394
00:26:35,962 --> 00:26:39,930
Thirty G's? Hell no!

395
00:26:39,932 --> 00:26:42,766
   No money, no way, no how.

396
00:26:42,768 --> 00:26:46,570
You don't negotiate with
         terrorists.

397
00:26:46,572 --> 00:26:48,205
Just look for clues
        or something.

398
00:26:48,207 --> 00:26:51,075
This is all just junk!

399
00:26:52,712 --> 00:26:57,881
Ugh. Check on this. Check that
   out. Put that somewhere.

400
00:26:57,883 --> 00:26:59,216
I can't do anything with
            that!

401
00:26:59,218 --> 00:27:03,120
 Just fucking taxes from two
        thousand an--

402
00:27:06,958 --> 00:27:09,893
You guys better come
        look at this.

403
00:27:17,202 --> 00:27:20,204
Oh, my God.

404
00:27:20,206 --> 00:27:24,041
We gotta catch that bitch and
        take her down.

405
00:27:24,043 --> 00:27:25,976
  Where do you think she went?

406
00:27:25,978 --> 00:27:28,345
No idea.

407
00:27:28,347 --> 00:27:31,682
- Wait a minute. Gimme your phone.
- Gimme your phone.

408
00:27:31,684 --> 00:27:32,683
    I think I can track her.

409
00:27:32,685 --> 00:27:33,784
How?

410
00:27:33,786 --> 00:27:36,320
I'm gonna drop a pin in her ass.

411
00:27:37,289 --> 00:27:41,125
We're doing the right thing,
        right Littles?

412
00:27:41,127 --> 00:27:44,795
I mean, you were suffocating in
     those clothes and...

413
00:27:44,797 --> 00:27:49,299
  oh that stroller! God. You
 must've felt like an idiot.

414
00:27:54,940 --> 00:27:59,109
If you wanna go back, bark three
    times in a row, okay?

415
00:27:59,111 --> 00:28:01,345
         I'm listening.

416
00:28:01,347 --> 00:28:06,116
Good.
   I agree with you. Whew.

417
00:28:06,118 --> 00:28:09,620
Two independent girls, out on
         the road...

418
00:28:09,622 --> 00:28:11,722
 kickin' ass and takin' names.

419
00:28:11,724 --> 00:28:16,794
        Whoooooohoooooo!

420
00:28:17,263 --> 00:28:20,931
Get on the highway. She got to
         the highway.

421
00:28:20,933 --> 00:28:21,765
      Tur-turn right here.

422
00:28:21,767 --> 00:28:24,034
Wait, right there?

423
00:28:24,036 --> 00:28:25,069
Ri--ya missed it!

424
00:28:25,071 --> 00:28:25,636
I'm sorry!

425
00:28:25,638 --> 00:28:27,004
Okay!

426
00:28:27,006 --> 00:28:30,174
This is exciting!

427
00:28:30,176 --> 00:28:33,277
I feel like we're on and episode
       of Hart to Hart.

428
00:28:33,912 --> 00:28:35,846
Jill, please, please,
   please please, please...

429
00:28:35,848 --> 00:28:38,749
she'll just turn her phone off
   and we'll lose the blip.

430
00:28:38,751 --> 00:28:41,018
Please just pull over somewhere
       so we can- Kat!

431
00:28:41,020 --> 00:28:43,020
Listen, you skinny circus freak

432
00:28:43,022 --> 00:28:44,088
Don't!

433
00:28:44,090 --> 00:28:45,089
Forget about the ransom.

434
00:28:45,091 --> 00:28:46,824
You're not going to see one red
            cent.

435
00:28:46,826 --> 00:28:49,927
Turn the fuck around and give
them back their dog, or I'll-

436
00:28:49,929 --> 00:28:51,695
Don't!

437
00:28:51,697 --> 00:28:52,930
Just look at the map.

438
00:28:52,932 --> 00:28:54,732
I can't tell which dot is ours.

439
00:28:54,734 --> 00:28:55,999
Ours is the one with the arrow.

440
00:28:56,001 --> 00:28:57,000
It's upside down!

441
00:28:57,002 --> 00:28:58,068
Well, flip it back over.

442
00:28:58,070 --> 00:28:59,336
Which dot!

443
00:28:59,338 --> 00:29:02,106
It's not a dot! Why are you such
        a computard?!

444
00:29:07,212 --> 00:29:09,413
Littles, I love you so much...

445
00:29:09,415 --> 00:29:14,051
so F-ing much, that if I ever
lost you, I would shoot myself--

446
00:29:14,053 --> 00:29:20,424
 in the head like this. Ruff!
        Ruff! Blooood!

447
00:29:20,426 --> 00:29:24,094
   Blood and guts and brain
 everywhere. Oh, there's that

448
00:29:24,096 --> 00:29:27,231
   memory. There's, there's
that time I went with Kent...

449
00:29:27,233 --> 00:29:31,068
to the-to the diner and I had to
        buy his food.

450
00:29:31,070 --> 00:29:34,805
And there's that time that I got
made fun of in second grade.

451
00:29:34,807 --> 00:29:38,909
And there's that time that my
mom said I looked like a boy.

452
00:29:38,911 --> 00:29:42,980
everywhere,
  all across the windshield.

453
00:29:42,982 --> 00:29:44,915
    Arf! Arf! Arf! Arf! Arf!

454
00:29:52,757 --> 00:29:57,261
Oh, my god! That's an invitation
        to pedophiles.

455
00:29:57,263 --> 00:30:01,265
Hey pervert, here's all the info
 you need to kidnap my kids.

456
00:30:01,267 --> 00:30:03,200
Now you can address them by name
   when you invite them...

457
00:30:03,202 --> 00:30:06,737
     into your creepy van.

458
00:30:06,739 --> 00:30:09,139
You can even
    invite Doug the cat.

459
00:30:09,141 --> 00:30:11,775
      So the cat can get
fucked. In da back of da van.

460
00:30:11,777 --> 00:30:12,776
Kat! Kat.

461
00:30:12,778 --> 00:30:16,980
Yeah, you shouldn't say
       stuff like that.
What?

462
00:30:29,428 --> 00:30:32,429
    I know Kat said that I
 wouldn't pay you anything,

463
00:30:32,431 --> 00:30:38,035
but I'm willing to go halves.
That's fifteen thousand dollars!

464
00:30:41,173 --> 00:30:46,376
I know you need it, so I am
    willing to compromise.

465
00:30:46,378 --> 00:30:48,212
What are you doing?

466
00:30:48,214 --> 00:30:51,481
I told you not to call her.

467
00:30:51,483 --> 00:30:54,051
             Phone.

468
00:31:27,085 --> 00:31:28,085
It's funny how people
          always d-

469
00:31:28,087 --> 00:31:30,053
It's not funny.

470
00:31:33,558 --> 00:31:36,894
Stop the car. Mama needs more
            vino.

471
00:31:41,833 --> 00:31:48,538
Jill. Jill, listen. You can have
        all the money.

472
00:31:48,540 --> 00:31:50,440
Jus-just tell us where to meet
            you...

473
00:31:50,442 --> 00:31:53,377
 and you can have all of it,
      okay? I gotta go,

474
00:31:53,379 --> 00:31:57,214
  but please, please, please
        call me back.

475
00:32:08,993 --> 00:32:12,629
Signal's gone. Wonder why, Abby.

476
00:32:12,631 --> 00:32:16,566
She turned her phone off! I told
     you not to call her!

477
00:32:16,568 --> 00:32:19,903
It's like I'm not even here
          sometimes!

478
00:32:19,905 --> 00:32:23,974
    Jesus Christ, you know
   I do know some things!

479
00:32:23,976 --> 00:32:25,943
        Fuck! Goddamnit!

480
00:32:25,945 --> 00:32:30,247
I'm sorry! I am sorry!

481
00:32:32,518 --> 00:32:35,085
What if we never find her?

482
00:32:35,087 --> 00:32:37,921
I'll buy you another Yorkie!

483
00:32:39,658 --> 00:32:40,891
Vino!

484
00:32:40,893 --> 00:32:43,260
Here!

485
00:32:43,262 --> 00:32:45,028
Put your seat belt on!

486
00:32:45,030 --> 00:32:48,131
I was going to!

487
00:32:50,436 --> 00:32:53,303
Oh, stop it!

488
00:33:00,945 --> 00:33:02,312
What's the game plan here?

489
00:33:02,314 --> 00:33:03,413
We'll keep checking the phone...

490
00:33:03,415 --> 00:33:05,215
 and hopefully she'll show up
            again.

491
00:33:05,217 --> 00:33:07,617
I'm exhausted. Nap and then
           dinner?

492
00:33:07,619 --> 00:33:11,321
Nap!

493
00:33:11,323 --> 00:33:14,091
         Okay. Us too.

494
00:33:23,001 --> 00:33:25,235
Oh, my god.

495
00:33:25,237 --> 00:33:27,237
It's not that bad.

496
00:33:28,607 --> 00:33:32,442
Ah. Oh, my God get it off. Get
     it off. Get it off!

497
00:33:32,444 --> 00:33:35,512
Help! Help me!

498
00:33:35,514 --> 00:33:37,114
Don't be a helpless victim.

499
00:33:37,116 --> 00:33:39,416
 With the Medical alert belt
clip, help is only a beep away.

500
00:33:39,418 --> 00:33:42,252
Did Jill turn her phone
             on?

501
00:33:42,254 --> 00:33:43,020
No.

502
00:33:52,431 --> 00:33:54,664
I'm going to get us some water.

503
00:34:04,976 --> 00:34:07,611
Grab a hard piece of
        wood. Cherry-

504
00:34:07,613 --> 00:34:09,479
Getting to first base in
          baseball-

505
00:34:57,261 --> 00:34:59,696
I got us fried chicken!

506
00:34:59,698 --> 00:35:01,031
 My favorite part of road trips

507
00:35:01,033 --> 00:35:02,666
    is being forced to eat
        fat-ass food.

508
00:35:02,668 --> 00:35:04,201
 Too bad I couldn't find the
         Creamy Cone.

509
00:35:04,203 --> 00:35:07,604
Ah! Have I told you how much I
         missed you?

510
00:35:07,606 --> 00:35:08,538
That's so sweet.

511
00:35:10,509 --> 00:35:12,042
What is that?

512
00:35:12,044 --> 00:35:15,145
You smell so good.
 What is that? Biscuit flour?

513
00:35:15,147 --> 00:35:16,680
Okay. We already tried that at
         Lilith Fair.

514
00:35:16,682 --> 00:35:19,516
I'm not being sexual, it's just
   that you smell really...

515
00:35:19,518 --> 00:35:21,785
that my Grandma used to make for
  me and I really miss her-

516
00:35:21,787 --> 00:35:23,420
Okay, you're a freak.

517
00:35:23,422 --> 00:35:24,521
No! No!

518
00:35:24,523 --> 00:35:28,792
Who wants some
     Chick-Chick-Chicken?

519
00:35:31,062 --> 00:35:33,163
Is that your Mom?

520
00:35:35,567 --> 00:35:37,701
I'll be in the bar.

521
00:35:37,703 --> 00:35:40,670
   How can this place not
         have a bar?

522
00:35:50,715 --> 00:35:53,083
Hey if you want to talk...
           okay...

523
00:35:53,085 --> 00:35:54,451
Stan and Dan Janson...

524
00:35:54,453 --> 00:35:57,420
Private Investigators at your
           service.

525
00:35:57,422 --> 00:35:59,356
  Is your spouse cheating on
             you?

526
00:35:59,358 --> 00:36:01,291
You need Real Professionals.

527
00:36:01,293 --> 00:36:03,426
Is your employee embezzling
            funds?

528
00:36:03,428 --> 00:36:05,295
You need Real Professionals.

529
00:36:05,297 --> 00:36:06,296
Are you searching...

530
00:36:06,298 --> 00:36:07,497
    for a long lost parent?

531
00:36:07,499 --> 00:36:08,832
You need Real Professionals.

532
00:36:08,834 --> 00:36:10,400
If you answered yes-

533
00:36:10,402 --> 00:36:11,501
Yes!

534
00:36:11,503 --> 00:36:13,837
to any of those questions.

535
00:36:13,839 --> 00:36:15,205
     Then you need to call-

536
00:36:15,207 --> 00:36:18,375
Us! Real Professionals!

537
00:36:18,377 --> 00:36:23,113
Reeeaal Professionals.

538
00:36:23,115 --> 00:36:25,148
How much longer are we
   going to hang out here?

539
00:36:25,150 --> 00:36:28,852
What do you mean? As long as it
            takes.

540
00:36:28,854 --> 00:36:30,387
The movers are coming tomorrow.

541
00:36:30,389 --> 00:36:32,322
We need to figure this out, make
        some calls...

542
00:36:32,324 --> 00:36:34,691
   start cancelling stuff,
something. She may never turn

543
00:36:34,693 --> 00:36:37,294
her phone back on again. That's
 totally possible, you know.

544
00:36:37,296 --> 00:36:40,297
We have no leads, nothing to go
     on. The ransom's...

545
00:36:40,299 --> 00:36:42,465
 not even an option anymore.
She's too scared to claim it.

546
00:36:42,467 --> 00:36:43,633
How do you know?

547
00:36:43,635 --> 00:36:45,669
You can't get inside her head
     any more than I can.

548
00:36:45,671 --> 00:36:48,138
What- the- what the hell am I
supposed to tell my new boss,

549
00:36:48,140 --> 00:36:50,774
huh? Sorry, I can't move to San
        Francisco...

550
00:36:50,776 --> 00:36:51,841
  cause my dog was kidnapped?

551
00:36:51,843 --> 00:36:53,410
Tell him someone died.

552
00:36:53,412 --> 00:36:55,679
Tell him your Mom died. I don't
            care.

553
00:36:55,681 --> 00:37:01,518
   Laila and I would never
      move without you.

554
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:04,654
         I need candy.

555
00:37:04,656 --> 00:37:06,289
Go get your candy.

556
00:37:27,945 --> 00:37:30,280
Come on, Littles. Come on.

557
00:37:55,740 --> 00:37:56,806
What's the plan?

558
00:37:56,808 --> 00:37:57,507
Shhhhh!

559
00:37:57,509 --> 00:37:59,342
You go that way.

560
00:37:59,344 --> 00:38:01,911
- You go that way.
- I'll go this way.

561
00:38:01,913 --> 00:38:03,947
Just do what I say!

562
00:38:12,690 --> 00:38:14,858
I don't know what I'm supposed
            to do.

563
00:38:16,962 --> 00:38:17,527
Gimme that!

564
00:38:21,733 --> 00:38:22,899
Oh god!

565
00:38:22,901 --> 00:38:24,534
My eyes!

566
00:38:27,539 --> 00:38:28,972
Oh, crap! Oh crap!

567
00:38:36,281 --> 00:38:37,480
Oh, my god it burns!

568
00:38:37,482 --> 00:38:41,718
Oh, my god it burns. Oh, my god!

569
00:38:42,453 --> 00:38:44,688
Oh, please let them be okay.

570
00:38:44,690 --> 00:38:47,257
Don't look at me like that. It
          was dark.

571
00:38:47,259 --> 00:38:49,893
  I thought they were rapists.

572
00:38:49,895 --> 00:38:51,795
       Where is my purse?

573
00:38:52,530 --> 00:38:54,364
Oh, I need water.

574
00:38:54,366 --> 00:38:57,500
You two need Real Professionals.

575
00:39:02,606 --> 00:39:06,309
Yeah, she's adorable. I'm sorry
     for your loss guys.

576
00:39:06,311 --> 00:39:07,510
Thank you.

577
00:39:07,512 --> 00:39:09,679
Anyways, uh...

578
00:39:09,681 --> 00:39:11,715
let's get the necessities out of
          the way.

579
00:39:11,717 --> 00:39:15,051
     The fee is gonna be
    $10,000 upon recovery.

580
00:39:15,053 --> 00:39:16,953
No problem.

581
00:39:20,291 --> 00:39:23,893
Oh, my god. Ahhh, yeah, okay.

582
00:39:23,895 --> 00:39:27,063
Laila, she have any, ah, friends
  that are a little more...

583
00:39:27,065 --> 00:39:28,798
unsavoury, maybe someone with a
         criminal...

584
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:31,301
record, a background, somethin'
          like that?

585
00:39:31,303 --> 00:39:34,304
Oh, we know who did it. It was
    our dog sitter, Jill.

586
00:39:34,306 --> 00:39:36,573
She did this.

587
00:39:36,575 --> 00:39:37,374
She did?

588
00:39:37,376 --> 00:39:38,975
She attacked us.

589
00:39:38,977 --> 00:39:41,711
We don't feel comfortable...

590
00:39:41,713 --> 00:39:43,046
  approaching her ourselves
         anymore...

591
00:39:43,048 --> 00:39:44,347
    I mean, you can see why.

592
00:39:44,349 --> 00:39:45,315
She sounds terrible.

593
00:39:45,317 --> 00:39:48,651
Thank you.

594
00:39:50,855 --> 00:39:53,523
  She told us that Laila was
    kidnapped and then...

595
00:39:53,525 --> 00:39:56,359
  we caught her walking her
    outside her apartment.

596
00:39:56,361 --> 00:39:57,794
Whaaat? That's crazy.

597
00:39:57,796 --> 00:39:58,528
She's-Yes!

598
00:39:58,530 --> 00:39:59,929
   She's a pathological liar.

599
00:39:59,931 --> 00:40:03,032
And she was wasted at our going
         away party.

600
00:40:03,034 --> 00:40:08,705
Here's a photo of her. Don't be
fooled by that Holiday smile.

601
00:40:08,707 --> 00:40:12,742
- She's pretty.
- She's really pretty.

602
00:40:12,744 --> 00:40:14,444
Are you sure this is the girl?

603
00:40:14,446 --> 00:40:16,646
   I-I don't see how a girl
 this pretty could steal a d-

604
00:40:16,648 --> 00:40:18,581
           Ah. Uh...

605
00:40:18,583 --> 00:40:20,083
She did this.

606
00:40:20,085 --> 00:40:20,917
She did this.

607
00:40:20,919 --> 00:40:22,752
Yeah. I'll find her.

608
00:40:22,754 --> 00:40:25,522
   I promise you guys. Okay?

609
00:40:45,644 --> 00:40:51,448
Why is he eating now? Shouldn't
  he be catching up to her?

610
00:40:53,584 --> 00:40:56,085
Ugh.

611
00:41:08,732 --> 00:41:13,703
Thirty seven cents and two
       ketchup packets.

612
00:41:13,705 --> 00:41:19,142
 That's all we have, Littles.
     Wanna meet my Mom?

613
00:41:33,757 --> 00:41:35,959
I guess she's busy, Littles.

614
00:41:37,596 --> 00:41:39,095
Hey! Hey! The blip came back on!

615
00:41:39,097 --> 00:41:42,932
Hold on. Hold on. Let me handle
            this.

616
00:41:42,934 --> 00:41:45,668
Okay.

617
00:41:58,850 --> 00:42:03,019
Hey, Dan. Jill's GPS says she's
    just west of the 95...

618
00:42:03,021 --> 00:42:04,854
and it looks like there aren't
    any towns around there

619
00:42:04,856 --> 00:42:08,858
 or anything, so I'm thinkin'
she must be at a... rest stop?

620
00:42:08,860 --> 00:42:10,226
Yeah-oh great!

621
00:42:10,228 --> 00:42:13,496
 Perfect! Yeah, I'm just, I'm
 drivin' just east of there.

622
00:42:13,498 --> 00:42:15,164
Oh, you are huh?

623
00:42:15,166 --> 00:42:17,534
You-you said the 95, right?

624
00:42:17,536 --> 00:42:18,835
Yeah.

625
00:42:18,837 --> 00:42:21,137
Okay.  Not a problem.

626
00:42:21,139 --> 00:42:23,540
   I am on the case. Got it.

627
00:42:39,691 --> 00:42:43,593
   Have you forgotten what
     she did to our eyes?

628
00:43:03,814 --> 00:43:05,248
Why is he taking photos?

629
00:43:05,250 --> 00:43:08,585
We already showed him a picture
           of her.

630
00:43:08,587 --> 00:43:10,353
She's going to the B room.

631
00:44:21,358 --> 00:44:23,359
What is he doing in there?!

632
00:44:23,361 --> 00:44:25,795
Why do you think I know what's
         he's doing?!

633
00:44:32,736 --> 00:44:34,604
If Laila's only hope is him...

634
00:44:34,606 --> 00:44:36,773
   then that pooch is Gone
         Doggy Gone.

635
00:44:36,775 --> 00:44:38,608
The Hell she is!

636
00:44:48,252 --> 00:44:50,353
What are you guys doin' here,
huh?! You guys followin' me?!

637
00:44:50,355 --> 00:44:51,788
Someone has to be a detective!

638
00:44:51,790 --> 00:44:52,755
Ah-ha-ha!

639
00:44:52,757 --> 00:44:54,257
    I am being a detective!

640
00:44:54,259 --> 00:44:57,026
    I-I-took incriminating
 photos and I bugged her car!

641
00:44:57,028 --> 00:44:58,361
Why didn't you just grab her
     while she was here?

642
00:44:58,363 --> 00:45:00,897
There's proper protocol you have
         to follow!

643
00:45:00,899 --> 00:45:02,799
   These things take time,
            guys!

644
00:45:02,801 --> 00:45:06,135
Come on! If I just grabbed her
    that's battery, okay?!

645
00:45:06,137 --> 00:45:09,005
Stop following me, go back to
        your motel...

646
00:45:09,007 --> 00:45:12,341
and I'll call ya when I get the
    dog. How 'bout that?

647
00:45:31,763 --> 00:45:33,329
We'll stay at my Mom's in New
           Mexico-

648
00:45:33,331 --> 00:45:35,965
Yes! New Mexico! Let's do this!

649
00:45:35,967 --> 00:45:39,102
And then we'll get back on our
feet  and hit the road, Thelma!

650
00:45:39,104 --> 00:45:41,738
         Arf! Arf! Arf!

651
00:45:57,922 --> 00:46:02,759
Just had a very interesting
conversation with the Harmons.

652
00:46:02,761 --> 00:46:04,193
      They are not happy.

653
00:46:04,195 --> 00:46:08,931
Said you took all kinds of
     photos of that girl,

654
00:46:08,933 --> 00:46:10,933
     and then let her get
     away. Is that right?

655
00:46:10,935 --> 00:46:14,837
  -it is right, but I-I was
  establishing a pattern of

656
00:46:14,839 --> 00:46:17,840
behavior to determine my rescue
          approach.

657
00:46:17,842 --> 00:46:26,282
- Danny! What did I say? KISS.
K-I-S-S. Keep it simple, stupid!

658
00:46:26,284 --> 00:46:27,750
  You know where she is right?

659
00:46:27,752 --> 00:46:30,920
Yes. Yes. I'm tailin' her right
 now. I got her in my sights.

660
00:46:30,922 --> 00:46:38,261
Ah. Yeah, well, uh, then I don't
   see what the problem is.

661
00:46:38,263 --> 00:46:42,031
   Mmmm. Get the Goddamn dog!

662
00:46:42,033 --> 00:46:45,468
Hello?

663
00:46:47,971 --> 00:46:49,438
Stan and Dan Janson.

664
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:51,474
    Private Investigators
         at your ser-

665
00:46:51,476 --> 00:46:53,910
Barracks were utterly destroyed.

666
00:46:53,912 --> 00:46:57,280
Most of the Military Personnel
of approximately 20 thousand...

667
00:46:57,282 --> 00:47:00,383
were wiped out. The distorted
steel framework is all that...

668
00:47:00,385 --> 00:47:02,084
 remains of a building which
        stood four...

669
00:47:02,086 --> 00:47:05,188
Did Dan respond to your
  text or call or anything?

670
00:47:05,190 --> 00:47:10,293
Let's see, thirty seconds ago
     he didn't respond...

671
00:47:10,295 --> 00:47:14,397
a minute ago he didn't respond,
       two minutes ago-

672
00:47:14,399 --> 00:47:20,036
Okay! I get it. Don't
     be a dick about it.

673
00:47:20,038 --> 00:47:26,375
  Sorry. I'm annoying myself.

674
00:47:47,798 --> 00:47:52,034
What's this? You're a smoker
    tryin' to quit, huh?

675
00:47:52,036 --> 00:47:59,008
Nope. Just spearmint.

676
00:47:59,010 --> 00:48:03,112
Ah. Cutesy little doll. Maybe a
   little drug trafficking?

677
00:48:03,114 --> 00:48:07,884
No. Just a doll. Whoa. That's
            uh...

678
00:48:07,886 --> 00:48:13,356
   That doll's had a rough
            time.

679
00:48:13,358 --> 00:48:20,129
Whoa. Look at you, Jill. What's
   this for, huh? Stabbin'?

680
00:48:20,131 --> 00:48:22,398
Doin' one of these?! Doin' one
   of these to somebody?!

681
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:25,034
           Heh heh.
  You're goin' down, babe.

682
00:48:25,036 --> 00:48:34,176
  You are being tracked by a
   professional. Uhh. Kay.

683
00:48:37,981 --> 00:48:45,922
   Puppy rescue. Children's
          Hospital.

684
00:48:45,924 --> 00:48:52,428
 She saves whales. She saves
          everyone.

685
00:48:56,600 --> 00:48:58,634
             Hmph.

686
00:49:09,212 --> 00:49:12,615
           Oh, Jill.

687
00:49:47,150 --> 00:49:49,418
- Arf! Arf! Arf!
- Arf! Arf! Arf! Arf!

688
00:49:52,322 --> 00:49:56,425
- Kat, go for a walk or something.
- You're driving us crazy.

689
00:49:58,695 --> 00:50:00,596
Stop it.

690
00:50:00,598 --> 00:50:03,132
I can't. Devon took my medicine.

691
00:50:03,134 --> 00:50:04,700
- It's not medicine.
- It's a crutch.

692
00:50:04,702 --> 00:50:08,671
If it makes me feel better, it's
          medicine.

693
00:50:22,452 --> 00:50:28,090
- What's up? It's okay. I'm cool.
- See I have a license.

694
00:50:28,092 --> 00:50:31,293
 It's my get out of jail free
 card. Like if a cop came by,

695
00:50:31,295 --> 00:50:37,600
     you could hand it to
     me and we'd be cool.

696
00:50:37,602 --> 00:50:40,336
Phew....

697
00:50:45,509 --> 00:50:54,350
- Oh, yes... You saved my life.
- Can I buy a little off you,

698
00:50:54,352 --> 00:50:58,487
or a lot? I mean, however much
you can spare. I'm desperate,

699
00:50:58,489 --> 00:51:02,725
well not desperate, okay, I'm
 desperate.  I-I'm travelling

700
00:51:02,727 --> 00:51:06,395
with The Borings. Looking for
their kidnapped dog. The amount

701
00:51:06,397 --> 00:51:08,764
of ransom they're spending on
that dog could feed a village

702
00:51:08,766 --> 00:51:11,634
   in Somalia. I mean, I do
love Africa though. I've been to

703
00:51:11,636 --> 00:51:16,605
Okay, just, shut
         up...please.

704
00:51:16,607 --> 00:51:18,140
It's a hundred.

705
00:51:18,142 --> 00:51:20,276
What?! That's not even an
 eighth. I've got like twenty

706
00:51:20,278 --> 00:51:23,646
bucks! Wait! I'll grab some cash
off The Borings. They're just a

707
00:51:23,648 --> 00:51:27,450
few doors down.  It'll
only take me a sec. Did I tell

708
00:51:27,452 --> 00:51:31,420
you that I love your tattoo? I
almost got a tribal tattoo once

709
00:51:31,422 --> 00:51:34,190
in Fiji, but Ichickened out when
I saw the  size of the needle. I

710
00:51:34,192 --> 00:51:36,158
    mean it was this giant
   porcupine quill covered

711
00:51:36,160 --> 00:51:38,494
in blood. Now, this was the 80's
  and AIDS was no laughing

712
00:51:38,496 --> 00:51:42,198
matter. I was like, okay, stick
     that in my ass HIV.

713
00:51:42,200 --> 00:51:47,403
Ah! Thank you! Thank
   you! Thank you!

714
00:51:47,405 --> 00:51:48,737

Okay. I'm just gonna stay

Oh, pfft, it's no big deal
       really.

No, it is, I don't know how
  much longer we would have

lasted out here, so...
       thanks.

775
00:55:33,764 --> 00:55:35,531
You don't have to keep

Well, if you'd accept my thanks,
I'd stop thanking you.

I have the same affirmation

Oh, my gosh.

787

- Unbelievable! And to think if

788

  my car hadn't broken down
  and you hadn't stopped to

789
00:56:11,869 --> 00:56:14,737
save us, well we'd never know
 that there was someone else

790
00:56:14,739 --> 00:56:19,608
 out there on the same lonely
highway with the same motto.
         Wow, right?

791
00:56:19,610 --> 00:56:21,844
Yeah. Yeah, wow.

792
00:56:21,846 --> 00:56:25,547
There are no
        coincidences.

793
00:56:33,356 --> 00:56:35,657
Well, that went well.

794
00:56:35,659 --> 00:56:37,626
I feel like they thought we
     were in some smarmy

795
00:56:37,628 --> 00:56:39,628
        Greek threesome.

796
00:56:39,630 --> 00:56:43,031
How are we gonna pay
        for the rooms?

797
00:56:44,033 --> 00:56:46,568
Why did they target us? What
      did we do to them?

798
00:56:46,570 --> 00:56:49,738
Sometimes bad things happen
       to good people.

799
00:56:49,740 --> 00:56:50,839
Run.

800
00:56:50,841 --> 00:56:52,374

Go! Go! Go!

00:56:56,846 --> 00:56:59,014
So, why are you going to
      your Mom's house?

Oh! Umm... it's...Christmas,
  heh. Summertime Christmas!

 just been so busy, you know,

806
00:57:15,666 --> 00:57:22,137
  and...and we never miss a
 holiday. We're very close.

807
00:57:22,139 --> 00:57:25,374
She taught me everything I know
      about sandwiches.

808
00:57:25,376 --> 00:57:30,012
Yeah, Dean, I know. I know I'm
late. I know, okay, uh, what did

809
00:57:30,014 --> 00:57:32,948

  were again? Hold on, just,

    you later. Bye.

812
00:57:42,959 --> 00:57:46,028
- What are you doing here?
- You could have called.

813
00:57:46,030 --> 00:57:48,597
I tried, but you didn't pick up.

814
00:57:48,599 --> 00:57:52,434
Tell your boyfriend to
 move the car. I'm late for a
           showing.

815
00:57:53,838 --> 00:57:55,037
What?!

816
00:57:55,039 --> 00:57:57,773
Mom...I'm in big trouble.

817
00:57:57,775 --> 00:58:02,678
Oh, Drama. Here we go. I'm
not giving you any more money.

818
00:58:02,680 --> 00:58:04,713
           I can't.

819
00:58:09,486 --> 00:58:12,120
Please hold her for me.

820
00:58:15,459 --> 00:58:17,426
Make it quick.

821
00:58:17,428 --> 00:58:19,127
I need-to talk to you.

822
00:58:19,129 --> 00:58:23,499
I can't hear you when
you're whining, Bunny. Spit it
             out!

823
00:58:23,501 --> 00:58:25,467
Could you please turn off your
            phone!

824
00:58:25,469 --> 00:58:31,673
Ugh, believe me I'd love to, but
I'm obligated to my clients. Oh

825
00:58:31,675 --> 00:58:39,615
hi, Sally. Ah, yes, I'm on the
way. Ah... the code is 8-5-6-7-9

826
00:58:39,617 --> 00:58:44,219
     hmm...uh...sorry can
 you hold for just a moment?

827
00:58:44,221 --> 00:58:48,090
Could I stay with you? Just
      for a little bit?

828
00:58:48,092 --> 00:58:54,530
- You always push.
- Fine. The key's in the

829
00:58:54,532 --> 00:59:00,669
armadillo. I'll be back by one
    and we'll sort it out.

830
00:59:02,972 --> 00:59:08,911
And don't slam the door. You
 have to press in the tongue

831
00:59:08,913 --> 00:59:11,747
   and release. No slamming!

832
00:59:23,526 --> 00:59:34,269
Hey! Please stop! Stop.

833
00:59:43,980 --> 00:59:50,152
- I'm sorry. It was just awkward.
- And ah...I wanted to give you

834
00:59:50,154 --> 01:00:02,698
privacy. Oh! Here's your dog
back. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

835
01:00:06,202 --> 01:00:10,238
Umm... we're running low
           on fuel.

836
01:00:10,240 --> 01:00:11,840
Oh, great!

837

838
01:00:14,278 --> 01:00:20,382

 lives nearby. Saved the day!

839
01:00:21,084 --> 01:00:26,254

- I'll find a way to get the

They were talking about

So, how did you two come
          together?

I asked her out after yoga
  class and she told me she
        was a lesbian.

897
01:05:51,415 --> 01:05:54,149
I had to. It's like,
all the other guys I went out

898
01:05:54,151 --> 01:05:58,987
None of them were
right! Especially Robert. Pfft.

899
01:06:00,222 --> 01:06:02,324
What did you tell her about
           Robert?

900
01:06:02,326 --> 01:06:06,328
Nothing. She's in tune.

You have a really nice place.

904
01:06:24,480 --> 01:06:31,519
I have to get real here. I'm
vibing in some very dangerous

905
01:06:31,521 --> 01:06:41,129
fear between you two and it's
poison. It's toxic! I'm sorry

906
01:06:41,131 --> 01:06:46,034
    but that's it. No more
bullshit stories. Yoga didn't

907
01:06:46,036 --> 01:06:48,103
      bring you together.

908
01:06:48,105 --> 01:06:49,304
That's how we met.

909
01:06:49,306 --> 01:06:52,107
No! What brought you
      together really?!

910
01:06:52,441 --> 01:06:54,342
I don't know what?

911
01:06:54,344 --> 01:06:57,679
Oh ho ho! Have you thought about
why you're crossing your arms?
             Hmm?

912
01:06:57,681 --> 01:06:58,680
Because it's comfortable?

913
01:06:58,682 --> 01:07:01,483
Because it's freezing in here?

914
01:07:02,018 --> 01:07:06,621
Because you're closing yourself
 off. Because you're afraid!

915
01:07:06,623 --> 01:07:07,655
Afraid of what?

916
01:07:07,657 --> 01:07:08,556
You tell me.

917
01:07:08,558 --> 01:07:10,058
No, you tell me.

918
01:07:10,060 --> 01:07:11,526
Is "no" your favorite word?

919
01:07:11,528 --> 01:07:13,762
No.

920
01:07:15,364 --> 01:07:16,698
Don't.

921
01:07:16,700 --> 01:07:18,633
Let these-

922
01:07:18,635 --> 01:07:19,267
Stop it.

923
01:07:19,269 --> 01:07:20,001

fucking yes! Are you all happy?

01:07:40,524 --> 01:07:42,223
       Is this happiness?

01:10:58,955 --> 01:11:01,189
You're so weird. Ya know that?

981
01:11:14,203 --> 01:11:16,437
I gotta be honest with you.

982
01:11:16,439 --> 01:11:17,605
Mhmm.

983
01:11:17,607 --> 01:11:19,307
I've been following you.

984
01:11:19,309 --> 01:11:23,378
Mmm. You're so bad,
        you dirty P.I.

985
01:11:23,380 --> 01:11:27,815
No, no. I really am a Private
        Investigator.

986
01:11:27,817 --> 01:11:32,253
I've been following you since
  the rest stop near the 95.

987
01:11:32,255 --> 01:11:36,224
The Harmons hired me to recover
   Laila and then have you
          arrested.

988
01:11:36,226 --> 01:11:37,792
Wait, you're here to arrest me!?

989
01:11:37,794 --> 01:11:43,831
Yeah. No, I mean I was, but
 J-Jill look I'm on your side

990
01:11:43,833 --> 01:11:46,701
right now. I-I can make this
           go easy!

992
01:11:48,905 --> 01:11:53,308
Come on! Don't leave! Jill,
      don't go!

994
01:11:56,745 --> 01:12:01,449
Jill, I have no way of getting
         out of here!

995
01:12:01,451 --> 01:12:03,918
This is where I will die!

997
01:12:07,690 --> 01:12:09,757

999
01:12:12,528 --> 01:12:14,395

Ahhhhh.

1003
01:12:50,432 --> 01:12:53,935
Oh, man. I-I gotta go to
             bed.

1004
01:12:53,937 --> 01:12:57,338
- Finish your glass with me.
- Come on.

1005
01:12:57,340 --> 01:13:00,775
No-no. I'm wasted. I
  really need to go to bed!

1006
01:13:00,777 --> 01:13:02,844
      Like an hour ago...

1007
01:13:02,846 --> 01:13:09,751
- Come on. I just wanna talk.
- You're so fun to talk to.

1009
01:13:13,857 --> 01:13:14,956
Oh, God.

01:13:14,958 --> 01:13:16,657
Abby!

1011
01:13:16,659 --> 01:13:17,725
I'm so sorry.

1012
01:13:17,727 --> 01:13:19,026
- I-I didn't kiss her.
              I-

1013
01:13:19,028 --> 01:13:20,995
I'm sorry. Oh, God.

1014
01:13:20,997 --> 01:13:23,364
I kissed him. He didn't
         do anything.

1015
01:13:23,366 --> 01:13:26,801
Abby ; How long has this been going    on?
 Wait a minute when-

1016
01:13:26,803 --> 01:13:28,803
when I-when the robbers came in
  and you two were in your

1017
01:13:28,805 --> 01:13:30,805
   underwear were you-were
         y-were you?

1018
01:13:30,807 --> 01:13:33,408
- No! No! No way! No. No.
   I did- I didn't do shit!

1019
01:13:33,410 --> 01:13:35,943
They were just some hoodlums
     I bought weed from.

1020
01:13:35,945 --> 01:13:36,778
What?!

1021
01:13:36,780 --> 01:13:38,446
I knew you did that!

1022
01:13:38,448 --> 01:13:40,882
I'm sorry, I fucked up I didn't
       know they were-

1023
01:13:40,884 --> 01:13:42,483
- Wait a minute.
- Wait, wait. You're sorry that

1024
01:13:42,485 --> 01:13:43,985
    you got us robbed, or
    you're sorry that you

1025
01:13:43,987 --> 01:13:47,355
 kissed my husband. It's not
  enough that your life has

1026
01:13:47,357 --> 01:13:50,057
        gone to shit,
   you have to ruin mine?

1027
01:13:51,059 --> 01:13:54,462
You don't need me to fuck
        up your life!

1028
01:13:54,464 --> 01:13:59,600
Who goes on a cross country
  crusade to find a dog?!!!

1029
01:13:59,602 --> 01:14:04,806
 Yeah, I said it. A dog! You
 could have a real baby, but

1030
01:14:04,808 --> 01:14:09,911
      noooo, it's easier
to treat your dog like a baby!

1031
01:14:09,913 --> 01:14:12,513
hmm-mm, hmm-mm.
- Laila is our baby.

1032
01:14:12,848 --> 01:14:17,652
- A human baby! It's embarrassing!
- People make fun of

1033
01:14:17,654 --> 01:14:20,121
you when you push her around in
        that stroller!

1034
01:14:20,123 --> 01:14:20,955
No they don't!

1035
01:14:20,957 --> 01:14:22,023
You put little bonnets on her!

1036
01:14:22,025 --> 01:14:23,391
I don't put bonnets on her.

1037
01:14:23,393 --> 01:14:25,793
- If you want a baby.
- Have a baby.

1038
01:14:25,795 --> 01:14:27,762
I don't want a baby.

1039
01:14:27,764 --> 01:14:29,430
Wait. You don't want a baby?

1040
01:14:29,432 --> 01:14:31,566
Why the Hell not?

1041
01:14:31,568 --> 01:14:33,935
None of your business!

1042
01:14:33,937 --> 01:14:37,505
I thought we were
waiting until we're financially
        ready to like-

1043
01:14:37,507 --> 01:14:39,540
It's not about the
 money. I work seventy hours

1044
01:14:39,542 --> 01:14:42,610
 a week. I don't have time. I
   travel. I'm bi-coastal.

1045
01:14:42,612 --> 01:14:44,145
      I'm in Europe half
          the year.

1046
01:14:44,147 --> 01:14:46,447
Then quit your job
and start your clothing line!

1047
01:14:46,449 --> 01:14:47,648
      What's the problem?

1048
01:14:47,650 --> 01:14:51,752
Yeah, I mean you
   could work from home and

1049
01:14:51,754 --> 01:14:54,422
we can like pool our resources
          together-

1050
01:14:54,424 --> 01:14:55,723
You're folding your
         arms again!

1051
01:14:55,725 --> 01:14:58,025
So, you are closed off!

1052
01:14:58,027 --> 01:14:59,694
Abby, open up!

1053
01:14:59,696 --> 01:15:03,498
Wh- why, tell us why, you don't
 want a baby? I want to know!

1054
01:15:03,500 --> 01:15:04,899
Why don't you
       want a baby?!!!

1055
01:15:04,901 --> 01:15:09,070
Okay! Okay! Okay! I am...
      afraid of babies.

1056
01:15:09,072 --> 01:15:10,805
Really?

1057
01:15:10,807 --> 01:15:13,441
Yes.

1058
01:15:13,443 --> 01:15:15,476
What?

1059
01:15:15,478 --> 01:15:21,983
I...have never actually held
one. I've had the opportunity,

1060
01:15:21,985 --> 01:15:27,021
but I'm afraid that I will drop
  them because they are soft

1061
01:15:27,023 --> 01:15:30,725
and delicate and they are like
little birds with no feathers.

1062
01:15:30,727 --> 01:15:32,560
Are you serious right now?

1063
01:15:32,562 --> 01:15:35,730
I'm totally serious. It is not
 hard to accidentally kill a

1064
01:15:35,732 --> 01:15:38,065
baby. People do it all the time.
It's always on the news. They

1065
01:15:38,067 --> 01:15:42,837
have tiny breathing holes and
 their heads are mushy. What

1066
01:15:42,839 --> 01:15:45,239
if you think that they're crying
and they're actually bleeding

1067
01:15:45,241 --> 01:15:48,175
internally? I don't want that
kind of pressure. I don't want

1068
01:15:48,177 --> 01:15:50,011
      to be a bad parent.

1069
01:15:50,013 --> 01:15:58,853
- That's so fucking stupid.
- That came out wrong.

1070
01:15:58,855 --> 01:16:04,058
it's just...I want someone to
     make a family with.

1071
01:16:04,060 --> 01:16:06,928
Well, then stop dating boy
 scouts and date someone with

1072
01:16:06,930 --> 01:16:11,866
some faults like the rest of us.
You deserve Taylor Lautner and,

1073
01:16:11,868 --> 01:16:14,101
         and the rest
  of us get Jason Alexander?

1074
01:16:14,103 --> 01:16:16,771
Thanks.

1075
01:16:17,039 --> 01:16:21,008
Grow up, Kat. You're 42.

1076
01:16:27,149 --> 01:16:30,117
I am?

1077
01:16:39,161 --> 01:16:41,362
Abby?

1079
01:17:11,627 --> 01:17:14,829
It's gonna be really hard for
 me to trust you for a while.

1080
01:17:14,831 --> 01:17:17,164
I know.

1081
01:17:17,166 --> 01:17:24,105
But you're my best friend
    and I love you. I do!

1082
01:17:24,640 --> 01:17:27,141
I love you too.

1083
01:17:27,143 --> 01:17:29,710
And I want to believe. I do, I
    believe that you were

1084
01:17:29,712 --> 01:17:35,716
   fucked up and lonely and
 desperate and really creepy!

1085
01:17:35,718 --> 01:17:36,717
Thank you!

1086
01:17:36,719 --> 01:17:37,785
Don't! Don't push it.

1087
01:17:37,787 --> 01:17:39,387
'kay.

1088
01:17:44,893 --> 01:17:50,798
But mostly you've been a really
good friend to me. And I want

1089
01:17:50,800 --> 01:17:57,171
 you to know that I did hear
  you, and...I will consider

1090
01:17:57,173 --> 01:18:01,776
  giving up the stroller and
   possibly the baby Bjorn.

1091
01:18:03,712 --> 01:18:10,985
And I'll cut back on the wine
  except on the weekend, and

1092
01:18:10,987 --> 01:18:18,192
Holidays and special occasions,
but otherwise it's like, none!

1093
01:18:18,194 --> 01:18:19,126
           You know?

1094
01:18:19,128 --> 01:18:22,196
Okay.

1095
01:18:22,864 --> 01:18:24,398
I..I-I'm still gonna wipe
 Laila's ass with baby wipes

1096
01:18:24,400 --> 01:18:26,867
  because to me that's just
 hygienic and she sleeps in
           the bed.

1097
01:18:26,869 --> 01:18:29,270
Agreed.

1098
01:18:37,879 --> 01:18:39,780
And we're not boring.

1099
01:18:39,782 --> 01:18:41,749
I know you're not.

1100
01:18:44,353 --> 01:18:46,787

it's... I'll support you in any
 decision you plan on making,

1109
01:19:45,348 --> 01:19:50,117
  okay? Cause I know you'll
     make the right one.

1110

  Cause you're a good person.

1111
01:19:55,223 --> 01:19:57,458
The right decision is to give
        the dog back.

1112
01:19:57,460 --> 01:20:01,929
I know. I really want to...

- Jill is willing to give Laila

1119

    back, but no jail time.

1120
01:20:18,848 --> 01:20:21,916
A-And the ransom, the
   ransom was just a ruse.

1121

And, she's super sorry.

Ah, I-I'm on the side of
     everybody wins here.

Really?

1146
01:21:35,057 --> 01:21:40,594
Yeah, I can work from home. You
could start your line, and we

1147
01:21:40,596 --> 01:21:43,264
would have more time together
    and we could work on-

1148
01:21:43,266 --> 01:21:44,598
Yes.

1149
01:21:44,600 --> 01:21:45,566

You worked too much. I was
  a little kid and you left

 I-I know I was mature for my

  only 10! I felt abandoned.

I never abandoned you! I had to
     work! Oh! You are so

1169
01:23:13,155 --> 01:23:17,358
ungrateful! What was I supposed
  to do, huh? I was a single

Hey, Danny.

Hey, I told you son,
Morty doesn't operate well on

1197
01:24:41,210 --> 01:24:44,478
extended deadlines. He started
   to doubt that I got the

      money coming to me.

1199

Oh, come on, Uncle Morty.

Don't mess with Morty! I know
he's like an Uncle to you, but

make no mistake he'll cut your

over here with the rest of them.

It's-it's okay he's with me,
    just do what he says.

Give me back my dog!

1205

That's your dog? I don't blame
you for being upset. Somebody

1206
01:25:08,737 --> 01:25:12,139
took my dog, I'd put a fucking
     hole in their head.

1207
01:25:12,141 --> 01:25:16,076
You give the dog back. You hand
   over the money, and you
