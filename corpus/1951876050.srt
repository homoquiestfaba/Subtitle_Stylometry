1
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:49,946
What are you so scared of?

2
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:52,917
If you move, you'll
get stabbed in the face.

3
00:00:59,059 --> 00:01:02,825
P-Please stop this!

4
00:01:03,163 --> 00:01:06,030
Dumb-ass. Stop crying.

5
00:01:07,534 --> 00:01:11,163
As punishment, we'll all
throw our knives at once.

6
00:01:13,373 --> 00:01:14,931
Ready, set...

7
00:01:15,041 --> 00:01:16,565
Cut that out!

8
00:01:22,182 --> 00:01:26,778
What if that kid gets
stabbed by your knives?

9
00:01:30,890 --> 00:01:32,187
Who are you?

10
00:01:33,026 --> 00:01:35,324
This is none of your business.

11
00:01:36,129 --> 00:01:39,326
Unfortunately, it is my business.

12
00:01:42,035 --> 00:01:43,832
You remember, don't you?

13
00:01:43,937 --> 00:01:47,202
Yu Hyuga. My little brother.

14
00:01:48,374 --> 00:01:50,842
You bullied him to death.

15
00:01:51,711 --> 00:01:53,941
I have no idea who that is.

16
00:01:54,781 --> 00:01:56,339
Oh, really?

17
00:01:57,917 --> 00:02:02,047
Even if you don't remember him,
he's waiting for you in hell!

18
00:02:03,189 --> 00:02:06,283
I'm gonna kill you!

19
00:02:32,952 --> 00:02:36,945
Stop screaming so pathetically.
You're a man, aren't you?

20
00:02:37,991 --> 00:02:40,585
You won't die from
getting your hand cut off.

21
00:02:41,094 --> 00:02:42,425
After all...

22
00:02:43,062 --> 00:02:45,428
I only have one arm too!

23
00:03:13,993 --> 00:03:17,156
I'll blast you to pieces!

24
00:03:25,405 --> 00:03:28,033
That thing is real! No fair!

25
00:03:28,241 --> 00:03:29,606
So what?

26
00:04:18,558 --> 00:04:19,525
Hey!

27
00:05:26,292 --> 00:05:28,522
Are you okay?

28
00:05:29,996 --> 00:05:31,861
You're safe now.

29
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:34,926
Murderer... Murderer...

30
00:05:35,068 --> 00:05:37,002
Murderer!

31
00:05:39,872 --> 00:05:43,205
That's right. I am a murderer.

32
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:49,072
But until a half year ago, I was
a normal high schooler who was able

33
00:05:49,182 --> 00:05:52,310
to hold her little
brother with her left arm.

34
00:05:55,455 --> 00:05:56,979
Here we go, Yoshie.

35
00:05:57,323 --> 00:05:58,558
<i>Six Months Ago</i>
All right!

36
00:05:58,558 --> 00:05:59,258
<i>Six Months Ago</i>

37
00:05:59,258 --> 00:06:01,283
<i>Six Months Ago</i>
Wait up!

38
00:06:03,363 --> 00:06:05,092
Wait, Ami!

39
00:06:06,966 --> 00:06:08,433
Wait! Wait!

40
00:06:10,169 --> 00:06:13,696
Nice shot! You're amazing, Ami!

41
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:17,173
You're really something. So cool.

42
00:06:17,443 --> 00:06:20,742
If you were a boy,
I might have fallen for you.

43
00:06:20,847 --> 00:06:22,144
Stop it.

44
00:06:22,248 --> 00:06:25,479
I don't want a girl
to have a crush on me.

45
00:06:26,886 --> 00:06:30,083
But it looks like
it's not that way after all.

46
00:06:30,156 --> 00:06:31,123
How so?

47
00:06:31,190 --> 00:06:34,853
Because it looks
like you have a young fan.

48
00:06:34,994 --> 00:06:36,757
You're so popular!

49
00:06:36,863 --> 00:06:39,331
And he's so cute. I'm jealous.

50
00:06:40,066 --> 00:06:42,864
Dummy. That's my little brother, Yu.

51
00:06:53,279 --> 00:06:57,613
I'm impressed, Sis. I had no idea
you were so good at basketball.

52
00:06:57,717 --> 00:07:00,083
You're always lying around the house.

53
00:07:00,186 --> 00:07:01,380
Quiet, you.

54
00:07:02,588 --> 00:07:05,284
So why'd you stop by today?

55
00:07:06,092 --> 00:07:10,893
There's always something going on
when you come visit me like that.

56
00:07:11,030 --> 00:07:15,126
I'll pay you back, so please lend
me money to buy a new game!

57
00:07:15,768 --> 00:07:17,201
I knew it.

58
00:07:17,537 --> 00:07:18,595
No way.

59
00:07:19,071 --> 00:07:22,040
We don't have that
kind of money to spend.

60
00:07:22,141 --> 00:07:24,701
Sis, please. I really want it.

61
00:07:24,811 --> 00:07:28,042
I'll clean up every day,
even wash the dishes.

62
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:30,643
Sis. Come on, Sis.

63
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:35,517
Really?

64
00:07:46,399 --> 00:07:47,525
Yu.

65
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:50,830
Takeshi, how much did you bring?

66
00:07:51,904 --> 00:07:54,566
I took 10,000 yen from my mom.

67
00:07:54,674 --> 00:07:56,938
I see. Me too.

68
00:07:58,311 --> 00:08:00,575
They're not gonna be happy.

69
00:08:19,332 --> 00:08:21,527
Hello, it's Yu.

70
00:08:21,667 --> 00:08:22,998
It's Takeshi.

71
00:08:23,102 --> 00:08:24,933
Excuse us.

72
00:08:26,606 --> 00:08:28,005
You're late.

73
00:08:28,107 --> 00:08:29,540
I'm sorry.

74
00:08:38,918 --> 00:08:40,385
Where's the money?

75
00:08:41,387 --> 00:08:44,015
Hurry up and hand it over.

76
00:08:45,791 --> 00:08:49,352
This isn't even half
of what we agreed on.

77
00:08:50,663 --> 00:08:51,960
Hey!

78
00:08:54,166 --> 00:08:55,428
Hey, Yu...

79
00:08:56,903 --> 00:08:59,133
How'd you get that money?

80
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:03,138
I borrowed it from my sister.

81
00:09:08,781 --> 00:09:13,514
Then I expect you to get
more by tomorrow. 200,000 yen.

82
00:09:15,254 --> 00:09:20,351
If you can't, then I'll make your sister
work at my dad's whorehouse.

83
00:09:20,493 --> 00:09:22,927
She has nothing to do with this!

84
00:09:23,629 --> 00:09:26,359
Who do you think you are?

85
00:09:31,437 --> 00:09:33,268
Don't get me wrong.

86
00:09:33,372 --> 00:09:35,840
I don't really want your money.

87
00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:41,076
I just wanna have fun
by seeing you guys suffer.

88
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:05,166
Teppei...
He's a peon, but he's cunning.

89
00:10:06,973 --> 00:10:10,101
Ryota Fujii... He's just a coward.

90
00:10:14,614 --> 00:10:18,072
But the one I hate most
is the leader, Sho Kimura.

91
00:10:19,585 --> 00:10:22,019
It's morning! Wake...

92
00:10:23,089 --> 00:10:24,886
Oh, you got up early.

93
00:10:26,225 --> 00:10:30,753
We're having fried chicken for
breakfast. They're still hot and tasty.

94
00:10:30,863 --> 00:10:31,852
Hot!

95
00:10:33,666 --> 00:10:36,430
Hey, what happened to your face?

96
00:10:36,769 --> 00:10:37,793
I fell.

97
00:10:37,903 --> 00:10:39,734
That can't be.

98
00:10:41,607 --> 00:10:42,835
Come back here.

99
00:10:43,376 --> 00:10:46,072
Yu, tell me the truth.

100
00:10:46,278 --> 00:10:49,076
Okay, I got into
a fight and got pummeled.

101
00:10:49,181 --> 00:10:50,978
You weren't bullied?

102
00:10:51,083 --> 00:10:56,248
No, I'm not that hopeless. I hit
a classmate who pissed me off.

103
00:10:56,455 --> 00:10:57,615
Watch it.

104
00:10:57,723 --> 00:11:01,022
You've done it now.
I won't go easy on you.

105
00:11:01,894 --> 00:11:06,593
You shouldn't use violence like that.
Remember what Dad used to say?

106
00:11:07,266 --> 00:11:08,324
Jeez.

107
00:11:10,269 --> 00:11:14,103
Violence doesn't solve anything.
It only hurts people.

108
00:11:15,041 --> 00:11:19,273
You and I fully understand that.

109
00:11:26,719 --> 00:11:30,985
When Mom and Dad killed
themselves over murder allegations,

110
00:11:31,090 --> 00:11:32,887
we promised then.

111
00:11:33,893 --> 00:11:36,225
Not to lose loved ones.

112
00:11:37,096 --> 00:11:39,826
To always be there for each other.

113
00:11:41,267 --> 00:11:44,930
No matter what happens,
I'm going to protect you.

114
00:11:46,172 --> 00:11:47,400
Sis...

115
00:12:22,441 --> 00:12:24,705
Listen, Sho.

116
00:12:26,679 --> 00:12:32,618
Whatever you do, do not ever bring
shame to our Hanzo Hattori clan.

117
00:12:36,555 --> 00:12:38,284
I know, Dad.

118
00:12:38,824 --> 00:12:47,027
We may be yakuza now,
but never lose your ninja pride.

119
00:12:49,101 --> 00:12:51,296
Never let your guard down.

120
00:12:51,403 --> 00:12:52,427
Never!

121
00:12:59,378 --> 00:13:01,846
Everyone except
yourself is an enemy!

122
00:13:02,581 --> 00:13:04,640
Think of them as slaves, right?

123
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:05,842
That's right!

124
00:13:06,819 --> 00:13:08,616
Do not fear blades.

125
00:13:08,754 --> 00:13:11,120
Use them to destroy your enemy!

126
00:13:11,223 --> 00:13:13,418
Destroy! Destroy!

127
00:13:16,262 --> 00:13:17,695
Very good.

128
00:13:18,631 --> 00:13:21,293
You are my flesh and blood.

129
00:13:24,737 --> 00:13:27,467
I will make our bond even greater.

130
00:13:32,244 --> 00:13:34,439
A cup of my own blood.

131
00:13:34,947 --> 00:13:38,246
Drink it to strengthen our bond.

132
00:13:40,319 --> 00:13:41,786
Drink it...

133
00:13:41,887 --> 00:13:44,447
Drink more...

134
00:13:45,524 --> 00:13:48,084
Drink it...

135
00:13:50,796 --> 00:13:52,195
Sho...

136
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:58,000
As long as you're around,
our clan will never die.

137
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:03,670
You are my treasure!

138
00:14:06,745 --> 00:14:09,213
Master, your breakfast is ready.

139
00:14:12,384 --> 00:14:13,373
Hey.

140
00:14:14,653 --> 00:14:16,848
You must be new.

141
00:14:18,224 --> 00:14:23,423
How dare you interrupt our sacred
ritual between father and son?

142
00:14:24,063 --> 00:14:25,360
You!

143
00:14:28,934 --> 00:14:31,368
Young master, have a good day.

144
00:14:36,742 --> 00:14:39,302
Good morning, Mom.
What are you doing?

145
00:14:39,411 --> 00:14:41,276
Oh, good morning.

146
00:14:41,814 --> 00:14:46,217
This maid's been messing
up a lot, so I'm punishing her.

147
00:14:46,552 --> 00:14:48,179
Have a nice day.

148
00:14:52,725 --> 00:14:54,625
Have a nice day!

149
00:14:58,831 --> 00:15:01,561
She was a terrible maid.

150
00:15:03,869 --> 00:15:05,131
Bye-bye.

151
00:15:10,709 --> 00:15:12,404
Have a nice day.

152
00:15:23,756 --> 00:15:27,089
Where are you going?
School's the other way.

153
00:15:27,559 --> 00:15:29,220
Where's the money?

154
00:15:31,664 --> 00:15:34,098
Wait! Come back!

155
00:15:36,235 --> 00:15:37,998
What the hell?

156
00:15:38,103 --> 00:15:40,298
Watch where you're going!

157
00:15:40,773 --> 00:15:44,436
Come here, you! Come on!

158
00:15:45,344 --> 00:15:46,504
You open?

159
00:15:46,612 --> 00:15:47,874
Hello.

160
00:15:49,915 --> 00:15:52,475
Excuse me! Is Takeshi here?

161
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:56,888
Hey! Wait! Who are you?

162
00:15:58,490 --> 00:16:02,449
What's wrong with kids these days?
They don't even say hello.

163
00:16:02,861 --> 00:16:05,352
Miki, do you know that kid?

164
00:16:06,265 --> 00:16:07,391
Miki?

165
00:16:11,437 --> 00:16:13,302
What was that?

166
00:16:15,941 --> 00:16:19,104
I'm scared... I'm scared...

167
00:16:20,546 --> 00:16:23,709
Those guys are... It's me.
We're in trouble. Run for it.

168
00:16:23,816 --> 00:16:24,783
What should we do?

169
00:16:24,783 --> 00:16:27,411
What should we do?
What do you want with Takeshi?

170
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:28,387
Sorry...

171
00:16:28,387 --> 00:16:29,388
Sorry...
Ma, this is my friend, Yu Hyuga.

172
00:16:29,388 --> 00:16:31,288
Ma, this is my friend, Yu Hyuga.

173
00:16:33,926 --> 00:16:38,454
You're the son of
those alleged murderers.

174
00:16:38,897 --> 00:16:42,458
That's not true! My dad
was framed and killed himself.

175
00:16:42,601 --> 00:16:44,398
I don't care.

176
00:16:45,537 --> 00:16:48,028
Just stay away from my son.

177
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:49,573
Go home!

178
00:16:51,110 --> 00:16:52,668
Takeshi? Takeshi!

179
00:16:53,512 --> 00:16:55,912
Takeshi, where are you going?

180
00:16:56,015 --> 00:16:57,277
Takeshi!

181
00:16:59,518 --> 00:17:00,085
Ready?

182
00:17:00,085 --> 00:17:01,052
Ready?
Okay.

183
00:17:01,153 --> 00:17:02,415
Go for it!

184
00:17:04,356 --> 00:17:07,621
You're amazing!
Nice shot! Just as I expected!

185
00:17:08,193 --> 00:17:11,993
I'm jealous of you. Seeing you
and Yu get along like that.

186
00:17:12,097 --> 00:17:15,658
He seems like a nice kid.
He must be easy to deal with.

187
00:17:15,768 --> 00:17:17,633
That's not true.

188
00:17:17,736 --> 00:17:21,536
He's very selfish.
I don't know what to do with him.

189
00:17:24,376 --> 00:17:25,570
This is bad!

190
00:17:27,379 --> 00:17:29,074
Y-Yoshie, excuse me.

191
00:17:29,181 --> 00:17:31,115
W-Wait, Ami!

192
00:17:31,216 --> 00:17:33,810
Where are you going? Jeez...

193
00:17:42,928 --> 00:17:44,020
Hold it!

194
00:17:44,863 --> 00:17:46,728
Where do you think you're going?

195
00:17:46,832 --> 00:17:48,959
Stop running away, man!

196
00:17:59,745 --> 00:18:00,679
Sorry...

197
00:18:00,679 --> 00:18:01,805
Sorry...
Hey.

198
00:18:02,014 --> 00:18:03,481
Where to, girl?

199
00:18:03,582 --> 00:18:04,844
I'm in a rush.

200
00:18:04,950 --> 00:18:07,942
What's the rush?
Where are you going?

201
00:18:08,053 --> 00:18:09,418
Stop!

202
00:18:12,458 --> 00:18:14,483
Who do you think you are?

203
00:18:15,127 --> 00:18:17,527
No! No! Stop!

204
00:18:17,629 --> 00:18:18,596
No!

205
00:18:20,766 --> 00:18:22,063
Stop...

206
00:18:22,167 --> 00:18:24,465
No! Stop!

207
00:18:29,374 --> 00:18:31,308
What are you thinking?

208
00:18:31,443 --> 00:18:33,377
You broke your promise.

209
00:18:34,046 --> 00:18:38,244
Do you know how embarrassing
this is for a yakuza's son?

210
00:18:48,894 --> 00:18:50,293
Stop!

211
00:18:50,662 --> 00:18:52,254
Stop!

212
00:19:00,105 --> 00:19:03,074
Beating on you two isn't much fun.

213
00:19:03,642 --> 00:19:06,611
I think I want Yu's sister to be my toy.

214
00:19:07,079 --> 00:19:10,845
I hear she's got big tits,
and she's cute. Go find her.

215
00:19:14,486 --> 00:19:18,013
Don't you dare lay
a finger on my sister!

216
00:19:30,602 --> 00:19:33,935
You sissies. You pissed me off.

217
00:19:35,407 --> 00:19:37,875
I won't take it easy on you!

218
00:19:37,976 --> 00:19:39,967
What the hell?

219
00:19:53,859 --> 00:19:55,224
Yu!

220
00:20:15,981 --> 00:20:19,473
You're pretty strong.
Is your sister strong too?

221
00:20:19,651 --> 00:20:21,414
She's much stronger!

222
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:24,082
Then she should've trained you better.

223
00:20:33,632 --> 00:20:34,894
Takeshi...

224
00:20:37,502 --> 00:20:38,628
Are you okay?

225
00:20:38,737 --> 00:20:40,432
Yu, I'm scared...

226
00:20:42,107 --> 00:20:43,438
Shut up!

227
00:20:47,179 --> 00:20:48,840
Takeshi!

228
00:20:49,615 --> 00:20:50,877
Takeshi!

229
00:20:59,625 --> 00:21:00,717
See ya.

230
00:21:14,706 --> 00:21:15,832
Sis...

231
00:21:21,413 --> 00:21:22,380
Yu?

232
00:21:31,823 --> 00:21:33,120
Yu...

233
00:21:34,626 --> 00:21:35,923
Yu!

234
00:22:03,655 --> 00:22:04,679
Yu...

235
00:22:05,724 --> 00:22:07,055
Yu...

236
00:22:07,993 --> 00:22:10,393
This is some kind of joke, right?

237
00:22:40,058 --> 00:22:40,692
<i>Sugihara Motors</i>

238
00:22:40,692 --> 00:22:43,024
<i>Sugihara Motors</i>

239
00:22:53,171 --> 00:22:54,468
Takeshi...

240
00:22:56,541 --> 00:22:58,907
Why did you have to go?

241
00:23:00,979 --> 00:23:02,139
Takeshi...

242
00:23:03,415 --> 00:23:04,382
Takeshi...

243
00:23:04,449 --> 00:23:05,250
Excuse me.

244
00:23:05,250 --> 00:23:06,808
Excuse me.
Takeshi...

245
00:23:19,831 --> 00:23:21,162
Who are you?

246
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,991
I'm Yu's older sister.

247
00:23:25,370 --> 00:23:28,464
I'm so sorry about Takeshi...

248
00:23:29,508 --> 00:23:31,135
What do you want?

249
00:23:31,643 --> 00:23:34,840
The police are trying
to call it a suicide.

250
00:23:36,181 --> 00:23:40,311
But I know someone was
responsible for their deaths.

251
00:23:42,354 --> 00:23:44,083
If only I had a lead...

252
00:23:44,256 --> 00:23:45,416
Stop it.

253
00:23:46,391 --> 00:23:49,690
I don't want you playing the victim.

254
00:23:50,095 --> 00:23:51,153
Look.

255
00:23:51,963 --> 00:23:57,128
If it weren't for your brother,
Takeshi would still be alive!

256
00:23:58,403 --> 00:23:59,495
But...

257
00:24:00,138 --> 00:24:02,572
You people are murderers.

258
00:24:02,741 --> 00:24:05,733
Your family brings misfortune
to everyone around you!

259
00:24:05,811 --> 00:24:06,971
Stop it!

260
00:24:07,379 --> 00:24:08,812
Get out of here!

261
00:24:08,914 --> 00:24:10,108
Miki.

262
00:24:19,291 --> 00:24:27,062
Neither Yu, Dad, nor I
would ever kill anyone...

263
00:24:36,174 --> 00:24:38,904
There's no way Yu would kill himself.

264
00:24:40,946 --> 00:24:42,379
No way.

265
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:47,880
Someone forced him into it.

266
00:24:49,287 --> 00:24:51,551
Someone must've killed him!

267
00:25:12,210 --> 00:25:14,804
"People I want to kill."

268
00:25:15,780 --> 00:25:17,213
What is this?

269
00:25:19,584 --> 00:25:22,075
Why didn't I find out sooner?

270
00:25:25,156 --> 00:25:26,282
Yu...

271
00:25:26,925 --> 00:25:28,290
I'm sorry!

272
00:25:54,619 --> 00:25:55,813
I'm sorry.

273
00:25:56,254 --> 00:26:00,190
I'm not sure about tempura
in the morning. Is it okay?

274
00:26:16,775 --> 00:26:20,802
The incident with your
brother breaks my heart.

275
00:26:20,912 --> 00:26:23,779
I'm sad since I was his friend.

276
00:26:26,084 --> 00:26:30,043
Ryota, who's the leader of the group?

277
00:26:32,123 --> 00:26:35,320
Ryota needs to get to school, so...

278
00:26:37,429 --> 00:26:38,453
Wait.

279
00:26:38,763 --> 00:26:41,789
Well, I'm going.
Make yourself at home.

280
00:26:43,168 --> 00:26:44,328
So...

281
00:26:46,071 --> 00:26:51,031
Are you saying that our
Ryota bullied your brother?

282
00:26:54,212 --> 00:26:56,180
This diary is proof.

283
00:26:57,115 --> 00:27:00,482
I'd like you to come to
the police precinct with me.

284
00:27:00,585 --> 00:27:02,280
You're an idiot!

285
00:27:03,722 --> 00:27:08,716
We've been in the police business
ever since my grandfather's time.

286
00:27:10,729 --> 00:27:12,697
You're Hyuga, right?

287
00:27:13,665 --> 00:27:17,032
I know that your father is a murderer.

288
00:27:18,803 --> 00:27:21,670
Trying to falsely accuse my son...

289
00:27:24,476 --> 00:27:26,444
What do you want?

290
00:27:27,278 --> 00:27:29,303
Murderer!

291
00:27:31,750 --> 00:27:32,808
What?

292
00:27:35,253 --> 00:27:38,689
If he was being bullied,

293
00:27:39,658 --> 00:27:43,458
maybe it was because something
was wrong with your brother.

294
00:27:43,561 --> 00:27:47,497
I don't want you blaming us
for your brother's problems.

295
00:27:51,670 --> 00:27:53,103
Please stop.

296
00:27:54,673 --> 00:27:56,698
I want to talk calmly.

297
00:27:56,808 --> 00:27:58,537
I can't talk to you.

298
00:27:58,943 --> 00:28:05,007
A minx like you should be arrested!

299
00:28:12,357 --> 00:28:15,793
Stop!
There's no need for this violence!

300
00:28:15,894 --> 00:28:19,489
I'm doing this to protect my son!

301
00:28:27,205 --> 00:28:28,365
Please stop!

302
00:28:59,270 --> 00:29:01,363
It's hot!

303
00:29:10,014 --> 00:29:13,211
Oh, it fried up very nicely.

304
00:29:13,485 --> 00:29:15,248
Such tasty tempura.

305
00:29:20,959 --> 00:29:23,826
Hot! Hot! Hot!

306
00:29:30,401 --> 00:29:32,096
Damn it!

307
00:29:32,470 --> 00:29:33,767
H-Honey!

308
00:29:36,407 --> 00:29:38,466
Honey, are you okay?

309
00:29:40,445 --> 00:29:42,572
Don't call the cops.

310
00:29:43,047 --> 00:29:47,108
I'll find her and finish her off!

311
00:29:56,094 --> 00:29:57,288
It stings...

312
00:29:57,395 --> 00:29:58,657
Oh, it stings...

313
00:29:58,763 --> 00:30:00,025
It stings.

314
00:30:00,498 --> 00:30:01,931
l-It stings...

315
00:30:02,033 --> 00:30:03,694
Ow...

316
00:30:04,002 --> 00:30:05,560
Ow...

317
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:30,418
Stop.

318
00:30:30,995 --> 00:30:34,021
If you make a noise, I'll slit your throat.

319
00:30:34,132 --> 00:30:38,330
Now apologize to Yu
and tell me who your leader is.

320
00:30:38,436 --> 00:30:39,664
I don't know.

321
00:30:42,207 --> 00:30:47,144
I'll tell you. The leader is
a yakuza's son, Sho Kimura!

322
00:30:47,545 --> 00:30:49,513
Sho Kimura?

323
00:30:52,050 --> 00:30:55,076
I can't breathe... Murderer...

324
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:59,549
I always believed that it was
wrong to kill no matter what.

325
00:31:00,391 --> 00:31:03,918
But I learned from your parents

326
00:31:05,296 --> 00:31:07,890
that there's a time and place for it!

327
00:31:19,677 --> 00:31:21,042
A blackout?

328
00:32:26,311 --> 00:32:28,438
Ryota!

329
00:32:58,076 --> 00:33:02,206
I hope you rot in hell together!

330
00:33:10,421 --> 00:33:14,084
Mother, there's
no conditioner. Can you get some?

331
00:33:15,460 --> 00:33:19,191
Sir, how about
an unusual conditioner?

332
00:33:21,099 --> 00:33:23,966
It can't be... you!

333
00:33:29,774 --> 00:33:33,540
Ryota!

334
00:33:33,644 --> 00:33:36,442
Wash your hair with your son's blood!

335
00:33:40,118 --> 00:33:42,643
Ryota!

336
00:33:47,458 --> 00:33:48,789
Ryota?

337
00:33:49,460 --> 00:33:51,928
Please, God!

338
00:33:56,367 --> 00:33:58,130
Serves you right.

339
00:34:09,614 --> 00:34:13,345
I'm a demon! I turned into a demon!

340
00:34:19,857 --> 00:34:24,385
I'll remain a demon until I kill
every last one of Yu's enemies!

341
00:34:34,338 --> 00:34:35,896
Delicious.

342
00:34:46,084 --> 00:34:48,109
Here are your noodles and soup...

343
00:34:48,219 --> 00:34:50,380
Hot!

344
00:34:50,655 --> 00:34:53,590
Hey! What do you think you're doing?

345
00:34:54,659 --> 00:34:57,253
What'll you do
about the master's leg?

346
00:34:57,361 --> 00:35:00,228
I don't like that look on your face!

347
00:35:02,967 --> 00:35:04,025
Hey!

348
00:35:07,171 --> 00:35:10,004
Keep it down.

349
00:35:21,652 --> 00:35:23,586
Sorry about that.

350
00:35:25,857 --> 00:35:28,951
You must be the new chef, right?

351
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:30,286
Yes...

352
00:35:30,495 --> 00:35:32,190
Got kids?

353
00:35:32,296 --> 00:35:33,263
No.

354
00:35:36,734 --> 00:35:38,895
Kids are great.

355
00:35:40,071 --> 00:35:46,909
I did a lot of bad things in
my life, but my kids need me.

356
00:35:50,982 --> 00:35:53,644
Sho means everything to me.

357
00:35:54,685 --> 00:35:56,846
I live because of him.

358
00:35:58,923 --> 00:36:02,290
And you caused him great pain...

359
00:36:04,562 --> 00:36:07,622
Cut off a finger as an apology!

360
00:36:08,933 --> 00:36:10,525
Please forgive me!

361
00:36:14,906 --> 00:36:18,239
Honey, that's not right.

362
00:36:18,743 --> 00:36:21,268
You always do this.

363
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:24,580
I'm really sorry about all this.

364
00:36:27,752 --> 00:36:29,344
You're too soft!

365
00:36:31,656 --> 00:36:37,060
Even all five fingers wouldn't
be enough to make it up to Sho!

366
00:36:38,629 --> 00:36:42,565
I am formerly of the Kanto Beasts!
Don't fuck with me!

367
00:36:43,935 --> 00:36:45,300
No!

368
00:36:45,736 --> 00:36:48,432
If you don't want to die,

369
00:36:50,007 --> 00:36:54,467
then at least apologize like
the true chef you are, huh?

370
00:37:01,919 --> 00:37:05,616
Excuse me. I want
to ask you for directions.

371
00:37:06,157 --> 00:37:08,125
Where do you need to go?

372
00:37:08,993 --> 00:37:10,654
Where's Sho Kimura?

373
00:37:11,395 --> 00:37:13,260
Take me to him!

374
00:37:16,234 --> 00:37:16,367
Now, eat some sushi...

375
00:37:16,367 --> 00:37:19,928
Now, eat some sushi...

376
00:37:21,505 --> 00:37:24,736
Eat as much as you want...

377
00:37:29,614 --> 00:37:31,775
Go ahead and eat.

378
00:37:34,285 --> 00:37:36,219
If you say so...

379
00:37:42,727 --> 00:37:45,855
How do your fingers taste?

380
00:37:49,367 --> 00:37:52,234
We need a new
chef starting tomorrow.

381
00:37:52,803 --> 00:37:54,862
I'm going to the bathroom.

382
00:38:20,898 --> 00:38:22,525
You're Sho Kimura?

383
00:38:23,167 --> 00:38:25,135
Who the hell are you?

384
00:38:25,236 --> 00:38:27,261
What was that sound?

385
00:38:27,438 --> 00:38:28,496
Sho!

386
00:38:29,607 --> 00:38:31,768
Who the hell are you?

387
00:38:32,076 --> 00:38:34,442
Stay back or I'll slit his throat.

388
00:38:34,545 --> 00:38:38,174
I'm not afraid to die.
I just want to kill him.

389
00:38:41,285 --> 00:38:44,049
No way. You can't kill me.

390
00:38:44,822 --> 00:38:46,016
What's that?

391
00:38:49,827 --> 00:38:51,886
You won't get away! Someone!

392
00:38:51,996 --> 00:38:53,156
Right!

393
00:39:08,379 --> 00:39:10,404
She's good.

394
00:39:48,419 --> 00:39:49,784
You...

395
00:39:50,988 --> 00:39:53,047
You killed my Yu!

396
00:39:59,764 --> 00:40:00,890
Go through!

397
00:40:13,944 --> 00:40:19,644
You did pretty good for a girl.

398
00:40:21,519 --> 00:40:23,646
But it's over now.

399
00:40:24,488 --> 00:40:27,946
I'm sure you know what's
going to happen to you, right?

400
00:40:49,580 --> 00:40:52,947
Yu's sister, I feel sorry for you.

401
00:40:53,217 --> 00:40:55,048
You were so close.

402
00:40:55,853 --> 00:41:00,381
Wounds from burns and a katana.
Your arm is a mess, girl.

403
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:07,725
We, the Hattori clan, won't kill
our enemy after they're captured.

404
00:41:09,767 --> 00:41:14,932
We give them a taste
of hell before killing them.

405
00:41:16,407 --> 00:41:22,073
I thought your stupid
son was the crazy one,

406
00:41:24,415 --> 00:41:28,749
but you're all insane!

407
00:41:31,889 --> 00:41:35,256
You have pretty fingers...

408
00:41:37,628 --> 00:41:42,292
I can't believe these belong
to such a strong girl like you...

409
00:41:43,534 --> 00:41:48,801
Slice, slice, slice these fingers off...

410
00:41:50,207 --> 00:41:52,675
O great Hanzo Hattori.

411
00:41:52,776 --> 00:41:57,236
Provide this girl with
great pain and suffering.

412
00:42:05,089 --> 00:42:06,920
It hurts!

413
00:42:11,795 --> 00:42:16,255
That was for all three of us.

414
00:42:18,168 --> 00:42:20,500
But we're not done yet.

415
00:42:22,139 --> 00:42:25,836
Now this is from the great Hanzo!

416
00:42:36,153 --> 00:42:39,645
It looks pretty nice without any fingers.

417
00:42:42,893 --> 00:42:45,862
I think that's enough for today.

418
00:42:46,030 --> 00:42:47,622
One minute.

419
00:42:48,566 --> 00:42:49,760
Wait.

420
00:42:51,035 --> 00:42:53,595
You should keep going, honey!

421
00:42:53,704 --> 00:42:58,505
Torture isn't fun unless
you do it a little bit at a time.

422
00:42:59,209 --> 00:43:03,669
That's why you're too soft.
You should finish her off at once!

423
00:43:03,781 --> 00:43:06,272
You shut up and let me do my job!

424
00:43:46,724 --> 00:43:49,192
I'm gonna give you a painkiller.

425
00:43:49,727 --> 00:43:51,718
The boss is being kind.

426
00:43:52,830 --> 00:43:57,392
It's a shame you're
gonna be hacked up tomorrow.

427
00:43:59,870 --> 00:44:02,771
Such a nice body.

428
00:44:06,076 --> 00:44:09,807
Give me the key
to unlock this chain! Now!

429
00:44:17,521 --> 00:44:19,614
What is this?

430
00:44:20,257 --> 00:44:22,691
Shit. She escaped.

431
00:44:23,861 --> 00:44:26,125
Hey! Someone!

432
00:44:28,032 --> 00:44:29,431
What's wrong?

433
00:44:29,533 --> 00:44:30,864
That girl...

434
00:44:34,905 --> 00:44:38,397
That bitch... Where did she go?

435
00:44:42,579 --> 00:44:45,377
Like I said,
you were too easy on her!

436
00:44:46,884 --> 00:44:51,218
Find her and kill her.

437
00:45:29,359 --> 00:45:30,417
Yu...

438
00:45:31,595 --> 00:45:34,063
Where are you taking me?

439
00:46:03,627 --> 00:46:05,151
Don't overdo it.

440
00:46:05,262 --> 00:46:09,198
You won't be able to work
efficiently even if you work overtime.

441
00:46:09,299 --> 00:46:10,234
I'll take over.

442
00:46:10,234 --> 00:46:11,724
I'll take over.
Don't.

443
00:46:13,370 --> 00:46:15,565
I want to keep working.

444
00:46:17,241 --> 00:46:22,304
If I stop working for even a bit,
I start to think about Takeshi.

445
00:46:23,313 --> 00:46:24,541
I see...

446
00:46:35,125 --> 00:46:36,490
Hey, Miki!

447
00:46:36,593 --> 00:46:38,618
Someone's collapsed outside!

448
00:46:38,729 --> 00:46:40,697
Hey! Are you okay?

449
00:46:40,798 --> 00:46:43,232
Hey! Hey! Hey!

450
00:46:44,968 --> 00:46:46,333
Hey, Miki...

451
00:46:46,837 --> 00:46:48,771
Are you okay? Hey!

452
00:46:50,040 --> 00:46:50,274
Hey!

453
00:46:50,274 --> 00:46:52,174
Hey!
This girl...

454
00:47:05,522 --> 00:47:08,719
Are you sure you
know what you're doing?

455
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:12,194
Yeah. Don't worry.

456
00:47:13,297 --> 00:47:15,629
I'm the son of a doctor.

457
00:47:17,201 --> 00:47:22,571
When I was in the biker gang, I fixed
up buddies who got hurt in fights.

458
00:47:24,141 --> 00:47:25,540
Including you.

459
00:47:27,144 --> 00:47:31,706
Hey, you're going to throw her
out when she wakes up, right?

460
00:47:32,216 --> 00:47:35,208
I don't want to get
dragged into anything.

461
00:47:36,987 --> 00:47:39,888
Even if it has something
to do with Takeshi's death?

462
00:47:41,091 --> 00:47:44,754
I'm sure she's like this
because she discovered the truth.

463
00:47:45,629 --> 00:47:47,893
It's not safe for her out there.

464
00:47:47,998 --> 00:47:50,865
So you want to keep her here?

465
00:47:51,935 --> 00:47:53,197
No way.

466
00:47:55,739 --> 00:47:58,207
You have nothing against her, right?

467
00:48:02,312 --> 00:48:04,143
Hey, are you okay?

468
00:48:13,056 --> 00:48:14,353
You...

469
00:48:25,168 --> 00:48:26,533
I'm home.

470
00:48:37,714 --> 00:48:40,774
No! Who are you people?

471
00:48:40,884 --> 00:48:42,749
No! Get off of me!

472
00:48:50,661 --> 00:48:52,891
Sorry to barge in.

473
00:48:54,831 --> 00:48:59,859
We hear that you're
best friends with Ami Hyuga.

474
00:49:02,039 --> 00:49:06,135
Is she here?

475
00:49:07,144 --> 00:49:11,604
I don't know what you're
talking about. She's not here!

476
00:49:12,983 --> 00:49:15,543
I'm not involved with anything!

477
00:49:18,155 --> 00:49:20,419
I don't know any Ami.

478
00:49:21,291 --> 00:49:23,054
I don't know her!

479
00:49:23,160 --> 00:49:24,923
I see.

480
00:49:26,163 --> 00:49:28,324
I apologize then.

481
00:49:29,700 --> 00:49:32,464
She wasn't here after all, huh?

482
00:49:32,703 --> 00:49:37,140
Then we have to keep
you quiet about all this.

483
00:49:55,559 --> 00:50:01,054
Hey, why don't you do it with her?

484
00:50:01,631 --> 00:50:02,598
Right.

485
00:50:02,699 --> 00:50:07,102
It's not often that
you get to do a college girl.

486
00:50:13,010 --> 00:50:15,740
Where the hell did she go?

487
00:50:35,532 --> 00:50:38,831
You can eat a rice ball
with one hand, right? Here.

488
00:50:42,773 --> 00:50:45,537
So what you told us is true?

489
00:50:46,443 --> 00:50:49,105
Takeshi was killed by a yakuza's son?

490
00:50:49,212 --> 00:50:51,840
I wouldn't have lost
my arm if it weren't true.

491
00:50:51,948 --> 00:50:54,883
Who and where is he? Tell me!

492
00:50:54,985 --> 00:50:59,820
Shut up. I thought you didn't want
to have anything to do with me.

493
00:51:00,023 --> 00:51:03,550
Is that how you talk
to people who saved your life?

494
00:51:04,895 --> 00:51:08,831
You told me once
not to play the victim.

495
00:51:09,466 --> 00:51:11,991
Well, right back at you!

496
00:51:23,547 --> 00:51:25,242
Now you did it.

497
00:51:25,816 --> 00:51:30,549
I don't give a damn
if you only have one arm!

498
00:51:38,395 --> 00:51:41,091
Hey... What are you doing, Miki?

499
00:51:41,198 --> 00:51:43,428
She hasn't recovered yet.

500
00:51:43,533 --> 00:51:45,330
Please don't stop us.

501
00:51:45,969 --> 00:51:50,201
No matter what shape I'm in,
I just want to settle this.

502
00:51:51,675 --> 00:51:54,940
It's a battle between those
who've lost loved ones.

503
00:52:16,500 --> 00:52:18,695
The loser will be covered in blood.

504
00:52:22,873 --> 00:52:24,500
I can't lose.

505
00:52:25,408 --> 00:52:32,439
No matter what happens to my body,
I have to seek revenge for Yu's sake!

506
00:52:32,782 --> 00:52:34,147
Me too.

507
00:52:35,352 --> 00:52:39,846
I'm furious with myself for not
being able to protect Takeshi!

508
00:52:53,370 --> 00:52:54,337
Ow!

509
00:52:57,707 --> 00:52:59,140
Are you okay?

510
00:53:00,577 --> 00:53:05,640
Ami, you're pretty good
even if you only have one arm.

511
00:53:07,984 --> 00:53:10,919
You came at me
with everything you had.

512
00:53:11,388 --> 00:53:12,821
I like that.

513
00:53:14,024 --> 00:53:18,518
Mind if I join you
in getting your revenge?

514
00:53:19,296 --> 00:53:21,594
You'll be with a murderer.

515
00:53:21,865 --> 00:53:23,196
Are you sure?

516
00:53:23,767 --> 00:53:25,758
They're my enemies too.

517
00:53:26,269 --> 00:53:30,228
Besides, if there's a way to get
revenge by not killing people,

518
00:53:30,340 --> 00:53:32,638
then I'd like to know it.

519
00:53:33,710 --> 00:53:36,372
It's kill, kill, kill.

520
00:53:50,393 --> 00:53:54,022
Ami, it must be hard
to fight with that kind of body.

521
00:53:54,898 --> 00:53:57,093
I'll make you a new arm.

522
00:53:57,467 --> 00:53:59,492
One made of steel.

523
00:54:37,173 --> 00:54:40,165
You think you can
avenge your brother like that?

524
00:54:40,277 --> 00:54:43,474
He won't be able
to rest in peace, you idiot!

525
00:54:50,453 --> 00:54:51,087
It's tough!

526
00:54:51,087 --> 00:54:53,647
It's tough!
This training is for moving forward!

527
00:54:53,757 --> 00:54:56,317
You didn't even move a millimeter.

528
00:54:56,993 --> 00:54:58,756
Come on! Keep going!

529
00:55:20,550 --> 00:55:22,040
Cute face.

530
00:55:22,619 --> 00:55:24,814
Those are the eyes. Remember that!

531
00:55:38,034 --> 00:55:39,831
Can I help you?

532
00:55:41,738 --> 00:55:44,434
The Kimuras moved away recently.

533
00:55:45,408 --> 00:55:46,242
Where?

534
00:55:46,242 --> 00:55:48,574
Where?
How should I know?

535
00:55:48,712 --> 00:55:51,510
But I'm glad the yakuza are gone.

536
00:55:52,282 --> 00:55:53,374
Thank you.

537
00:56:16,139 --> 00:56:17,265
Suguru?

538
00:56:18,174 --> 00:56:19,539
Oh, Ami.

539
00:56:21,010 --> 00:56:22,534
I'm almost done.

540
00:56:23,613 --> 00:56:26,275
Thank you... for everything.

541
00:56:28,251 --> 00:56:31,311
I hope you'll stay friends with my wife.

542
00:56:33,690 --> 00:56:36,887
She can't have any more kids.

543
00:56:38,828 --> 00:56:43,094
I wasn't able to understand her pain.

544
00:56:44,734 --> 00:56:45,894
But, Ami...

545
00:56:46,636 --> 00:56:50,072
She was saved by meeting you.

546
00:56:51,841 --> 00:56:54,833
So please take good care of her.

547
00:56:57,013 --> 00:56:58,139
I will.

548
00:57:00,049 --> 00:57:02,347
Ami! We have a problem!

549
00:57:02,752 --> 00:57:04,481
The Kimura family's gone.

550
00:57:04,554 --> 00:57:05,521
What?

551
00:57:05,622 --> 00:57:07,556
They're up to something.

552
00:57:07,657 --> 00:57:10,455
Hey, do you hear a strange noise?

553
00:57:24,741 --> 00:57:26,075
The machine gun...

554
00:57:26,075 --> 00:57:27,372
The machine gun...
Okay!
