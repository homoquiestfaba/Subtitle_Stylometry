1
00:00:48,281 --> 00:00:52,183
Listen, you're in a privileged position
to learn a thing or two.

2
00:00:52,285 --> 00:00:54,776
Keep your mouth shut
and your eyes open.

3
00:00:54,888 --> 00:00:56,378
Runteldat.

4
00:01:33,193 --> 00:01:36,219
I been through so much,
you know, in my life, so...

5
00:01:36,329 --> 00:01:39,093
I kind of wanted to get back out
and tell my own story.

6
00:01:41,634 --> 00:01:45,832
Maryland, DC, is my hometown,
so I grew up here.

7
00:01:48,741 --> 00:01:52,871
I'm a little man, so you kind of get
the 'little man"complex sometimes.

8
00:01:52,979 --> 00:01:55,106
You feel like you gotta
fight for everything.

9
00:01:55,215 --> 00:01:59,049
You even gotta fight for when the
french fries have been taken from you.

10
00:02:28,081 --> 00:02:30,447
First of all. We would like
to thank God...

11
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:34,850
who just helping us to see another day
to get up to bring you comedy.

12
00:02:34,954 --> 00:02:38,219
Can you hear
what the fuck I'm saying?

13
00:02:44,864 --> 00:02:47,389
I'm not saying that all people
in the media are bad.

14
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:51,129
Some of them do theirjob.
Some of them do the research...

15
00:02:51,237 --> 00:02:53,228
and they report the truth.

16
00:02:53,339 --> 00:02:55,239
Actor and comedian
Martin Lawrence...

17
00:02:55,341 --> 00:02:58,208
was apprehended by Los Angeles
police offiicers yesterday...

18
00:02:58,311 --> 00:03:02,008
after he was discovered in the middle
of one of LA 's most congested streets...

19
00:03:02,115 --> 00:03:04,845
hurling obscenities at passing cars.

20
00:03:04,951 --> 00:03:07,511
The popular television personality
was admitted to a nearby hospital...

21
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:11,112
by LAPD offiicers
after they subdued him by force.

22
00:03:13,393 --> 00:03:17,056
No one is immune to the trials
and tribulations of life.

23
00:03:17,163 --> 00:03:20,098
No one. We all have ups,
and we all have downs.

24
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:22,168
I mean, that's just life.

25
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:25,865
Martin Lawrence's current scrape
with the law...

26
00:03:25,972 --> 00:03:28,031
could be evidence
of Martin's mania.

27
00:03:28,141 --> 00:03:30,541
Something's obviously
gone wrong in this man's head.

28
00:03:30,643 --> 00:03:33,134
I mean, hejust settled
a case out of court...

29
00:03:33,246 --> 00:03:36,238
because he attacked somebody
with a bottle who was making a toast.

30
00:03:36,349 --> 00:03:39,716
Why? Well, apparently,
he didn't like the phrasing.

31
00:03:39,819 --> 00:03:43,983
Martin's acting like a madman,
and people don't think it's funny.

32
00:03:44,090 --> 00:03:47,082
But other people in the media,
some reporters...

33
00:03:47,193 --> 00:03:50,185
and some tabloids,
they ain't interested in the truth.

34
00:03:50,296 --> 00:03:52,764
All right? They like
to sensationalize bullshit.

35
00:03:52,865 --> 00:03:54,833
You do the math.

36
00:03:54,934 --> 00:03:56,561
From bad boy on the big screen...

37
00:03:56,669 --> 00:03:58,261
to a menace in real life...

38
00:03:58,371 --> 00:04:02,307
how far will Martin's fans go
to stand behind their tarnished hero?

39
00:04:04,043 --> 00:04:07,342
It's easy to fade into obscurity
in Hollywood. Martin better watch out.

40
00:04:08,881 --> 00:04:12,442
If Martin doesn't clean up his act,
he's not gonna be acting anywhere.

41
00:04:14,187 --> 00:04:17,452
- I'm not perfect. I'm only human.
- Important words to live by.

42
00:04:18,825 --> 00:04:22,090
Fuck 'em.
Fuck 'em. Girl. Fuck 'em.

43
00:04:25,431 --> 00:04:28,628
We're all one 'cause we're
all human, you know.

44
00:04:28,735 --> 00:04:32,227
We experience a lot of the same things.
Just as we wake, we sleep.

45
00:04:32,338 --> 00:04:34,306
Just as we live, we die.

46
00:04:34,407 --> 00:04:36,932
That's just life, human nature.

47
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:49,614
He had a body temperature
registering...

48
00:04:49,722 --> 00:04:53,158
at slightly over
107 degrees Fahrenheit.

49
00:04:53,259 --> 00:04:55,784
He was, at that time,
in a coma and unresponsive.

50
00:04:55,895 --> 00:04:59,023
Fuck dying.
Fuck dying.

51
00:05:00,199 --> 00:05:03,430
Mama said. "The world is yours.
Don't sleep."

52
00:05:04,671 --> 00:05:06,070
Fuck dying.

53
00:05:06,172 --> 00:05:08,163
After spending
three days in a coma...

54
00:05:08,274 --> 00:05:10,174
Martin Lawrence's condition
is improving.

55
00:05:10,276 --> 00:05:12,744
His eyes will focus on a person.

56
00:05:12,845 --> 00:05:17,214
He can't talk just yet because
we do have a tube down his throat.

57
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:19,547
But he is alert,
and he is improving.

58
00:05:19,652 --> 00:05:22,280
One of the achievements
I'm most proud of is...

59
00:05:22,388 --> 00:05:24,515
to be where I'm at
in this business today...

60
00:05:24,624 --> 00:05:26,353
after everything
that I've been through.

61
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:29,995
You know, I can honestly say
I'm blessed.

62
00:05:32,365 --> 00:05:34,799
There's all kind of folks
that was just negative...

63
00:05:34,901 --> 00:05:36,869
when it came to Marty.

64
00:05:36,969 --> 00:05:37,867
- I remember that shit.
- Right.

65
00:05:37,970 --> 00:05:40,700
Well. We still here.
and they can run tell that.

66
00:05:40,807 --> 00:05:42,274
Runteldat. Nigger.

67
00:06:20,513 --> 00:06:22,572
We've been mashing city to city
for six months...

68
00:06:22,682 --> 00:06:25,242
putting this tour together.

69
00:06:25,351 --> 00:06:27,478
I think doing stand-up comedy...

70
00:06:27,587 --> 00:06:30,249
is one of the hardest things
that somebody could do, you know?

71
00:06:33,659 --> 00:06:37,493
You know, when you get on stage
and you got the microphone...

72
00:06:37,597 --> 00:06:40,225
and thousands of people,
you know...

73
00:06:40,333 --> 00:06:43,734
waiting for you to make 'em laugh,
you got to bring it.

74
00:06:55,848 --> 00:06:58,681
That's why I love it.
You know, it's a challenge.

75
00:07:00,019 --> 00:07:02,385
It's who I am.

76
00:07:02,488 --> 00:07:04,683
Yeah, it's game time.

77
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:22,307
Ladies and gentlemen,
Martin Lawrence!

78
00:07:28,981 --> 00:07:29,879
Come on!

79
00:08:27,173 --> 00:08:28,508
DC. I love you.

80
00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:29,440
DC. I love you.

81
00:08:30,543 --> 00:08:32,636
I'm home.
I'm home.

82
00:08:32,745 --> 00:08:34,940
I love you so much.
Thank you.

83
00:08:35,047 --> 00:08:37,538
That was...
Hey. What can I say?

84
00:08:38,684 --> 00:08:40,652
You make it all worth it.

85
00:08:40,753 --> 00:08:43,984
What can I say. You know?
This is what it's about.

86
00:08:46,058 --> 00:08:47,525
Thank you.

87
00:08:47,627 --> 00:08:51,688
Oh. Man. And y'all look good.
Everybody's dressed tonight.

88
00:08:51,797 --> 00:08:54,732
Came out. "Fuck it. We going
to see that nigger. Fuck it.

89
00:08:54,834 --> 00:08:58,133
Show him some love."
Well. I had to come out tonight.

90
00:08:58,237 --> 00:09:01,673
I don't know if you just saw the film...
the tape and everything.

91
00:09:01,774 --> 00:09:04,436
I said. "Fuck it. I got to come out
and tell my own story."

92
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:09,038
I ain't waitin' for the
E! True Hollywood Story to tell my shit.

93
00:09:09,148 --> 00:09:10,308
You know what I mean?

94
00:09:10,416 --> 00:09:13,078
Fuck that.
I got to tell my own shit.

95
00:09:13,185 --> 00:09:16,120
I see you. Baby.
Hey. How you doin'?

96
00:09:16,222 --> 00:09:19,487
Yeah. Hello. The ladies just screamin'
like a motherfucker.

97
00:09:20,626 --> 00:09:22,059
Yeah. Thank you.
I know.

98
00:09:22,161 --> 00:09:25,619
But if you want to scream.
please send your panties up here. Okay?

99
00:09:25,731 --> 00:09:27,699
Just put your number
on your panties...

100
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:30,132
and I'll get back
according to the smell.

101
00:09:33,205 --> 00:09:37,835
Before I left the hotel. I was watching
something on TV... this lady.

102
00:09:37,944 --> 00:09:40,208
I'm gonna say. If you smoke.
please be careful...

103
00:09:40,313 --> 00:09:42,804
'cause I saw this lady on TV
had a hole in her neck.

104
00:09:42,915 --> 00:09:45,042
It was real bad.
Anybody see that shit?

105
00:09:45,151 --> 00:09:47,346
She was smoking the cigarette
with her neck. And she's. Like...

106
00:09:48,654 --> 00:09:51,214
And blowing the O's and shit
with her neck.

107
00:09:51,324 --> 00:09:54,521
Did anybody see that?
Please be careful if you smoke.

108
00:09:54,627 --> 00:09:58,996
'Cause that lady had a hole in her neck.
You could see food falling.

109
00:09:59,098 --> 00:10:02,431
When she eat. You could see string beans
and pudding and all that shit.

110
00:10:03,202 --> 00:10:06,467
You know?
I bet her breath don't stink.

111
00:10:06,572 --> 00:10:09,040
Her neck probably fuckin' stink.
huh. Man?

112
00:10:09,141 --> 00:10:12,770
You just put a fuckin' Altoid
in her neck and shit.

113
00:10:12,878 --> 00:10:15,540
If she choke on something. You ain't
gotta worry about the Heimlich.

114
00:10:15,648 --> 00:10:17,843
You just go right in the neck.
Got that.

115
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:20,919
Yeah. A piece of gristle. Baby.
That's all that was. A piece of gristle.

116
00:10:22,288 --> 00:10:25,257
You got to love a woman
with a hole in her neck. Fellas. You do.

117
00:10:25,358 --> 00:10:28,589
Take her out to eat and shit.
Got a hole in her fuckin' neck.

118
00:10:28,694 --> 00:10:31,288
But you get mad. "Look. Goddamn it.
Look at your neck.

119
00:10:31,397 --> 00:10:35,163
What have you got to fuckin' come to
the restaurant with your neck all out?

120
00:10:35,267 --> 00:10:38,168
Got the fuckin' maître d'
looking at ya. Shit. Goddamn.

121
00:10:38,270 --> 00:10:40,966
Oh. You couldn't put on
a turtleneck or nothin' tonight?

122
00:10:41,073 --> 00:10:44,509
Couldn't put no mock neck on?
None of that shit?"

123
00:10:46,112 --> 00:10:49,673
They say this lady got a man.
I know they be doing some freaky shit.

124
00:10:49,782 --> 00:10:51,716
I know he come home.
"Baby...

125
00:10:51,817 --> 00:10:54,479
I want to do something
a little different tonight.

126
00:10:55,521 --> 00:10:57,955
Let me put my dick
in your neck.

127
00:10:58,057 --> 00:11:01,584
Oh. That's some good neck there.
That's some good neck there.

128
00:11:01,694 --> 00:11:05,186
Fuck head. I said neck.
I like neck."

129
00:11:05,297 --> 00:11:07,492
Her ass straight to here
and shit.

130
00:11:16,876 --> 00:11:18,844
And I'd like to say...

131
00:11:18,944 --> 00:11:20,969
if there's any critics
here tonight...

132
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:23,480
fuck you and kiss my ass.

133
00:11:24,583 --> 00:11:27,780
I don't give a shit about you.

134
00:11:27,887 --> 00:11:30,378
They're like the scum of the earth
to me. Fuck them.

135
00:11:30,489 --> 00:11:32,514
I can't stand a critic.

136
00:11:32,625 --> 00:11:35,116
My mother don't like me to say
that I hate. But I can't stand 'em.

137
00:11:35,227 --> 00:11:38,856
What the fuck is a critic anyway? That's
somebody that can't do what you can do...

138
00:11:38,964 --> 00:11:41,797
so they want to criticize your shit.

139
00:11:41,901 --> 00:11:44,699
You know what I mean?
Think they authority on some shit.

140
00:11:44,804 --> 00:11:48,672
You want to criticize somethin'.
criticize these nuts.

141
00:11:49,742 --> 00:11:51,209
Fuck you.

142
00:11:51,310 --> 00:11:54,541
I don't see you
talkin' about my balls on the news.

143
00:11:54,647 --> 00:11:58,105
"One of Martin's balls
is bigger than the other.

144
00:11:58,217 --> 00:12:02,017
I give that a two star."
Get the fuck out of here. Man.

145
00:12:03,089 --> 00:12:06,422
But you know what? When I think about
everything that's going on...

146
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:11,321
Critics are so unimportant to what's
going on with the USA attacks...

147
00:12:11,430 --> 00:12:14,991
everything that happened here. The
Pentagon and New York. All that stuff.

148
00:12:15,101 --> 00:12:19,765
My heart goes out to families that have
went through all this and lost people.

149
00:12:19,872 --> 00:12:22,238
I feel for 'em.

150
00:12:22,341 --> 00:12:26,209
And it's a sad thing.
It really is a sad thing because...

151
00:12:26,312 --> 00:12:29,372
I'm glad to be an American.
This is the best country in the world.

152
00:12:29,482 --> 00:12:31,541
I can say that. You know.

153
00:12:31,650 --> 00:12:36,280
I wouldn't want to be nowhere else.
but when I seen this shit happen...

154
00:12:36,388 --> 00:12:39,482
I think any of us could've been on them
planes and anything that happened...

155
00:12:39,592 --> 00:12:41,560
been in one of them buildings
that they crashed into.

156
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:43,924
Any-fuckin'-body in here.
Know what I mean?

157
00:12:44,029 --> 00:12:47,055
If it affects one person.
it affects us all.

158
00:12:47,166 --> 00:12:50,966
And now my nerves are bad.
y'all. After this shit.

159
00:12:51,070 --> 00:12:54,039
I got to drink
Milk of Magnesia and shit.

160
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:57,837
Every time before I board a plane.
I don't know what the fuck's going on.

161
00:12:57,943 --> 00:13:01,344
But out of all this. This is one
of the first times in a long time...

162
00:13:01,447 --> 00:13:04,439
since I don't know when...
This is one of the first times...

163
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:08,179
I seen black and white people together
on something. Standing for a cause.

164
00:13:08,287 --> 00:13:10,721
It wasn't about race.
It's just about life.

165
00:13:10,823 --> 00:13:13,291
You know what I mean?
Nothin' else but life.

166
00:13:13,392 --> 00:13:15,360
Together on somethin'.

167
00:13:15,461 --> 00:13:17,759
We will get together
and fuck you up today...

168
00:13:17,863 --> 00:13:20,331
on this USA attacks.
you know what I mean?

169
00:13:20,432 --> 00:13:22,559
I ain't seen black and white people
together since...

170
00:13:22,668 --> 00:13:25,728
Stevie Wonder and Paul McCartney
did "Ebony and Ivory."

171
00:13:29,475 --> 00:13:31,670
So now. If I go to board a plane.
if you like me...

172
00:13:31,777 --> 00:13:34,769
you get nervous as a motherfucker.
you see somebody boardin'.

173
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:36,677
You sit there talking
to your white friend.

174
00:13:36,782 --> 00:13:38,750
"What's up. White boy.
I don't know you...

175
00:13:38,851 --> 00:13:42,446
but we getting on this plane together
and shit. Might as well be together.

176
00:13:43,956 --> 00:13:46,720
Who's that motherfucker getting
on the plane right there?

177
00:13:46,826 --> 00:13:50,489
You don't know that motherfucker?
Oh. Shit.

178
00:13:50,596 --> 00:13:52,063
Hakbim.

179
00:13:53,532 --> 00:13:56,126
You about to get on
this motherfuckin' plane. Man?

180
00:13:56,235 --> 00:13:59,636
Don't start no motherfuckin' shit
when we get on this plane. All right?

181
00:13:59,738 --> 00:14:01,831
I'll punch you
in your motherfuckin' mouth. Nigger.

182
00:14:01,941 --> 00:14:05,399
Nigger. Don't go for your hands.
Don't move your hands. Hold on.

183
00:14:05,511 --> 00:14:08,537
What you got in your shoes. Nigger?
What the fuck you got in your shoes?

184
00:14:08,647 --> 00:14:11,582
I'm-a tell you. Don't start no shit
when we get on this plane. Nigger.

185
00:14:11,684 --> 00:14:15,176
I will knock your motherfuckin'
ass the fuck out. I ain't playin'.

186
00:14:15,287 --> 00:14:18,779
We ain't done shit.
Don't start nothin'.

187
00:14:18,891 --> 00:14:22,122
'Cause the white boy can wrestle.
and I can box. Motherfucker.

188
00:14:24,096 --> 00:14:26,758
He'll tackle your ass.
and I'll punch the fuck out you.

189
00:14:29,101 --> 00:14:31,069
Don't start no shit."

190
00:14:31,971 --> 00:14:34,872
But your nerves is bad
with these USA attacks and shit.

191
00:14:34,974 --> 00:14:38,501
You don't know what's going on.
They lookin' for bin Laden.

192
00:14:38,611 --> 00:14:40,704
They ain't found his ass yet.

193
00:14:40,813 --> 00:14:46,410
How you not find... You blew up all that
shit. And you ain't found bin Laden yet?

194
00:14:46,518 --> 00:14:48,645
That motherfucker
at a club right now.

195
00:14:55,728 --> 00:14:57,855
What the fuck is that shit about?

196
00:14:57,963 --> 00:15:01,296
Ain't found no bin Laden.
You know why?

197
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:04,528
'Cause a lot of motherfuckers
look like bin Laden.

198
00:15:04,637 --> 00:15:08,038
There's a nigger in McDonald's right now
look just like bin Laden.

199
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:10,472
Got a high-top fade
and every-fuckin'-thing.

200
00:15:10,576 --> 00:15:12,771
You walk in that motherfucker
to get a cheeseburger...

201
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:16,405
"Bin Laden! That's bin Laden!

202
00:15:16,515 --> 00:15:18,483
Call the government.
That's motherfuckin' bin Laden.

203
00:15:18,584 --> 00:15:20,916
I know a motherfuckin' bin Laden
when I see...

204
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:23,454
Call the Taliban. Nigger.
That's him."

205
00:15:25,691 --> 00:15:28,285
'Cause they looked. Man.
You can't even find his ass.

206
00:15:28,394 --> 00:15:31,090
I almost fucked an Indian up
on the way in here.

207
00:15:31,196 --> 00:15:34,859
He said. "No. I Indian. I Indian."
I said. "Pull your turban up. Nigger.

208
00:15:36,702 --> 00:15:39,933
Let me see a dot or somethin'.
motherfucker.

209
00:15:40,039 --> 00:15:43,805
I'll fuck your ass up.
Don't start no shit.

210
00:15:43,909 --> 00:15:46,241
I'll crack that fuckin' dot.
Don't start it."

211
00:15:48,614 --> 00:15:52,744
It's just all crazy. What's this shit
about you can't open up mail?

212
00:15:52,851 --> 00:15:57,311
What the fuck is that shit?
You can't open up fuckin' mail?

213
00:15:57,423 --> 00:15:59,653
You open up mail.
you all fucked up.

214
00:16:08,467 --> 00:16:10,435
What the fuck is that shit?

215
00:16:11,904 --> 00:16:13,872
Can't open mail.

216
00:16:15,007 --> 00:16:18,807
That's probably a good thing
for the bill collectors though.

217
00:16:18,911 --> 00:16:23,211
You know. They call your house.
"Hi. Mr. Lawrence. Yeah.

218
00:16:23,315 --> 00:16:26,250
I sent out a bill
about three weeks ago...

219
00:16:26,352 --> 00:16:28,252
and I haven't received
payment on that.

220
00:16:28,354 --> 00:16:31,949
I was wondering if...
Was there a problem?

221
00:16:32,057 --> 00:16:35,549
Well. Is there a reason
that that's not paid?"

222
00:16:36,495 --> 00:16:38,486
"Ain't you been
watching the news. Nigga?

223
00:16:39,698 --> 00:16:41,928
I can't open it. Motherfucker.

224
00:16:43,302 --> 00:16:45,532
They got powder
and shit in there...

225
00:16:45,637 --> 00:16:49,698
that makes you lose your eyebrows
in 4.2 seconds. Motherfucker.

226
00:16:49,808 --> 00:16:53,642
You're welcome to bring your ass
over here and open it yourself...

227
00:16:53,746 --> 00:16:55,714
Mr. Bill Man."

228
00:16:57,349 --> 00:17:01,149
It's fucking crazy. Man. Anthrax.
This shit just don't make no sense.

229
00:17:01,253 --> 00:17:04,381
Now. I'll tell you.
life is so short. Y'all.

230
00:17:04,490 --> 00:17:06,458
You know. Please.
just realize that.

231
00:17:06,558 --> 00:17:09,220
You're not promised tomorrow.
you know.

232
00:17:09,328 --> 00:17:11,296
You really ain't.
You're not.

233
00:17:11,397 --> 00:17:14,889
Every day you get a chance to wake up.
you gotta really be grateful.

234
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,968
Most importantly. Be grateful...

235
00:17:17,069 --> 00:17:19,799
and ride this motherfucker
till the wheels fall off.

236
00:17:19,905 --> 00:17:21,873
Live your life.

237
00:17:21,974 --> 00:17:26,035
Ride this motherfucker
till the wheels fall off.

238
00:17:26,145 --> 00:17:29,342
When it's time to go. You're gone.
Fuck it. You don't owe nobody. Fuck it.

239
00:17:29,448 --> 00:17:31,575
If you do owe 'em. You're gone.
They can't get it.

240
00:17:34,887 --> 00:17:38,186
So now with all that... You know.
that gets you down every now and then.

241
00:17:38,290 --> 00:17:42,283
'Cause you see it every time
you turn on the news and all that.

242
00:17:42,394 --> 00:17:44,862
It's something that's gonna
be with us a long time.

243
00:17:44,963 --> 00:17:47,659
You know. That's just...
for the rest of our lives.

244
00:17:47,766 --> 00:17:50,633
I'm trying to do things
that make me feel good.

245
00:17:50,736 --> 00:17:53,068
Like. I'm watching Cops.

246
00:17:54,406 --> 00:17:57,705
Black people. Come on. Y'all know
we on Cops every fuckin' week.

247
00:17:57,810 --> 00:18:02,110
Every motherfuckin' week. Cops.
Black people. Starring black people.

248
00:18:02,214 --> 00:18:05,911
We runnin' through the motherfucker
with helicopters chasing us and shit.

249
00:18:06,018 --> 00:18:09,510
Go to commercial. Come back.
We still runnin' and shit.

250
00:18:09,621 --> 00:18:11,521
Runnin' like a motherfucker.

251
00:18:11,623 --> 00:18:13,887
You know. Just runnin'
in the fuckin' street. Man.

252
00:18:13,992 --> 00:18:16,790
But one thing I noticed
on Cops... Is it me?

253
00:18:16,895 --> 00:18:20,922
But white people get away
with a lot of shit with the cops.

254
00:18:21,033 --> 00:18:23,763
They talk to the cop.
They talk back like a motherfucker.

255
00:18:23,869 --> 00:18:27,805
They cuss their ass out. "What the fuck
did you pull me over for?

256
00:18:27,906 --> 00:18:32,275
I don't give a shit. I want to know
what did you pull me over for.

257
00:18:32,377 --> 00:18:37,314
I didn't fuckin' do nothin'. Asshole.
You fuckin' asshole. You're an asshole.

258
00:18:37,416 --> 00:18:39,976
You're an asshole.
and you're a dick. Yes.

259
00:18:40,085 --> 00:18:42,645
Fuck that. Man.
You don't pull me over for nothin'.

260
00:18:42,754 --> 00:18:46,815
Yeah. I know I was speeding.
ya fuck. I'm in a rush.

261
00:18:46,925 --> 00:18:50,019
What the fuck is wrong with you?
You're an asshole.

262
00:18:50,129 --> 00:18:52,029
And fuck you.
You're an asshole.

263
00:18:52,131 --> 00:18:56,295
And you're a dick. You know what.
why don't you put your dick in your ass?

264
00:18:56,401 --> 00:19:01,998
Fuck you. Fuck you.
My dad's gonna have your ass.

265
00:19:02,107 --> 00:19:06,305
There goes your $5 million
donation. You fuck.

266
00:19:07,346 --> 00:19:10,042
See your ass in court. Buddy."

267
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:13,912
They cuss the cops out
like a motherfucker.

268
00:19:14,019 --> 00:19:16,214
Black people. We don't
do that shit no more.

269
00:19:16,321 --> 00:19:19,757
Ever since that Rodney King
ass-whupping. We shut the fuck up.

270
00:19:19,858 --> 00:19:23,658
'Cause you never know if that shit's
gonna be us on TV tomorrow on tape.

271
00:19:23,762 --> 00:19:26,925
They pull us over. We...
"What's the problem. Officer?

272
00:19:27,032 --> 00:19:30,229
Yes. Was I what?
I was speedin'? Damn.

273
00:19:30,335 --> 00:19:34,169
Where's the light? I didn't even
see me go through the light. Damn it.

274
00:19:34,273 --> 00:19:36,798
Look here. Would you
give me a ticket?

275
00:19:36,909 --> 00:19:39,309
Yeah. Yeah.
'Cause I got to learn.

276
00:19:39,411 --> 00:19:42,175
I got to fuckin' learn. You know.

277
00:19:42,281 --> 00:19:44,249
Let me give you my full name.
my middle name.

278
00:19:44,349 --> 00:19:46,317
Let me spell that for you and stuff."

279
00:19:48,554 --> 00:19:51,648
We only that nice 'cause we know
we got some shit under the seat.

280
00:19:52,724 --> 00:19:55,716
Who knows what that is?
But...

281
00:19:55,827 --> 00:19:58,591
Latinos. They act like
they ain't from this country.

282
00:19:58,697 --> 00:20:00,858
They don't speak their English
when they get pulled over...

283
00:20:00,966 --> 00:20:03,526
till they see that ticket price.

284
00:20:03,635 --> 00:20:07,503
They get pulled over.
"No. No. What I do? I don't know.

285
00:20:07,606 --> 00:20:09,574
I don't know what I do.

286
00:20:09,675 --> 00:20:13,304
Speedy Gonzalez?
Was I caught speeding?

287
00:20:14,546 --> 00:20:16,104
Don't know."

288
00:20:17,416 --> 00:20:20,544
They see that ticket.
"Motherfucker. This is bullshit!"

289
00:20:25,891 --> 00:20:29,725
But I talk about watching
positive programs. You know.

290
00:20:29,828 --> 00:20:33,264
I joke about the cop shit. 'cause
ain't nothin' positive about that...

291
00:20:33,365 --> 00:20:35,595
gettin' arrested.
I'll tell you that.

292
00:20:35,701 --> 00:20:37,760
But a program that is positive.
if you ever get a chance to see it...

293
00:20:37,869 --> 00:20:40,565
it's called Eye on the Prize.

294
00:20:40,672 --> 00:20:44,403
This program will make you cry.
you know. I'm serious.

295
00:20:44,509 --> 00:20:47,034
If you ever seen it. You've seen that.
It's a beautiful thing.

296
00:20:47,145 --> 00:20:49,204
I'll tell you.
I love America.

297
00:20:49,314 --> 00:20:52,408
This is the best country in the world.
I wouldn't want to be anywhere else.

298
00:20:52,517 --> 00:20:54,781
But I'm a black man.
and I ain't forgot...

299
00:20:54,886 --> 00:20:58,913
what the fuck we. As black people.
have been through in America.

300
00:20:59,024 --> 00:21:01,458
You know what I mean?

301
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:03,528
We ain't gonna just
act like shit is all right...

302
00:21:03,629 --> 00:21:06,154
but we gonna work towards change.
to make it better.

303
00:21:06,265 --> 00:21:10,565
That's what people... in this
Eye on the Prize... have done for us.

304
00:21:10,669 --> 00:21:15,038
They put their lives out there
so that we can be in the forefront...

305
00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:17,108
so that we can better ourselves.

306
00:21:17,209 --> 00:21:19,700
Isn't that beautiful. When you
look at Eye on the Prize...

307
00:21:19,811 --> 00:21:24,475
when you think of segregation
and civil rights and all those things?

308
00:21:24,583 --> 00:21:27,916
When I was watching Eye on the Prize,
you had Martin Luther King...

309
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:30,079
you know.
great man in history...

310
00:21:30,188 --> 00:21:34,318
Malcolm X... great man in history...
standing up for us...

311
00:21:34,426 --> 00:21:36,656
so that we could sit together.
blacks and whites.

312
00:21:36,762 --> 00:21:40,198
Work together. Freedom!
Grow together. That's beautiful.

313
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:43,427
Martin said...

314
00:21:43,535 --> 00:21:45,503
"Nonviolent. Nonviolent.

315
00:21:45,604 --> 00:21:48,095
We shall overcome.
I've been to the mountaintop.

316
00:21:48,206 --> 00:21:50,367
Nonviolent. Nonviolent."

317
00:21:50,475 --> 00:21:54,036
Malcolm said. "Yeah.
but by any means necessary."

318
00:21:56,114 --> 00:21:58,947
Martin said.
"Nonviolent. Nonviolent."

319
00:21:59,985 --> 00:22:02,476
"By any means necessary."

320
00:22:02,587 --> 00:22:04,555
Martin and Malcolm
were saying the same thing.

321
00:22:04,656 --> 00:22:07,454
They just had different opinions
and different approaches to it.

322
00:22:07,559 --> 00:22:10,357
I thought that was beautiful.
I said. "That's all right."

323
00:22:10,462 --> 00:22:14,558
But then one day I was watchin'.
and Martin Luther King...

324
00:22:14,666 --> 00:22:19,330
And I'm named after Martin.
I was proud. Martin!

325
00:22:19,438 --> 00:22:22,202
I watched him
go through Birmingham. Alabama.

326
00:22:22,307 --> 00:22:26,835
And this racist white boy
picked up a rock...

327
00:22:26,945 --> 00:22:30,813
you know. Like a half a boulder
or some shit.

328
00:22:30,916 --> 00:22:34,682
He pitched that motherfucker like he
was pitchin' for the Orioles...

329
00:22:34,786 --> 00:22:37,687
and hit Martin in his head.

330
00:22:37,789 --> 00:22:41,088
And all Martin did was say.
"Nonviolent. Nonviolent.

331
00:22:41,193 --> 00:22:43,787
Don't nobody do nothin'.
Nonviolent. Nonviolent.

332
00:22:43,895 --> 00:22:45,863
My head's bleeding right now.

333
00:22:45,964 --> 00:22:48,455
Don't nobody do nothin'.
We shall overcome.

334
00:22:48,567 --> 00:22:52,264
I've been to the mountaintop. I'm
having a dream right now. Nonviolent.

335
00:22:52,371 --> 00:22:55,272
Nonviolent. Nonviolent."

336
00:22:56,308 --> 00:22:58,708
I was proud. I said. "Damn.

337
00:22:58,810 --> 00:23:01,370
That takes a strong man
to get hit in the head...

338
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:05,416
with a half a boulder
and still say 'nonviolent. ' Damn!"

339
00:23:08,887 --> 00:23:11,378
But if you're like me...

340
00:23:11,490 --> 00:23:14,152
then one time you would have
loved to hear Martin say...

341
00:23:14,259 --> 00:23:17,422
"Another one of you motherfuckers
hit me with a rock...

342
00:23:18,563 --> 00:23:21,498
I'll beat your bitch ass.
you motherfucker.

343
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:24,296
Fuck that. Coretta.
These niggers think I'm soft.

344
00:23:24,403 --> 00:23:28,032
Let me show you how Martin
get down. Motherfucker.

345
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:30,108
This is how Martin get down."

346
00:23:32,110 --> 00:23:36,137
I know he got on his boys.
I know he was here and said. "Jesse.

347
00:23:36,248 --> 00:23:39,342
Damn it. Jesse. You seen
who threw that fuckin' rock. Jesse.

348
00:23:40,385 --> 00:23:42,853
Get off your ass
and go handle that.

349
00:23:44,222 --> 00:23:47,055
Stop chasing them ho's. Jesse."

350
00:23:55,233 --> 00:23:57,201
Can I get a little water?

351
00:24:00,839 --> 00:24:02,807
I gotta ask y'all.

352
00:24:02,941 --> 00:24:04,966
There's predominantly
black people in here.

353
00:24:05,076 --> 00:24:07,044
They don't want you to pause
in no show.

354
00:24:12,150 --> 00:24:14,084
"Come on. Hurry up."

355
00:24:14,186 --> 00:24:16,746
Somebody put something in his mouth.
My zipper's stuck. Y'all.

356
00:24:25,464 --> 00:24:27,159
I warned you.
Watch your mouth now.

357
00:24:28,266 --> 00:24:32,327
Don't forget who the original
DefJam host was. Motherfucker.

358
00:24:39,478 --> 00:24:41,446
I know I'm gettin' old.
Thirty-six. Man.

359
00:24:41,546 --> 00:24:43,707
You know. Gettin' older. Yeah.

360
00:24:43,815 --> 00:24:46,750
You don't do the same things
you do when you get older.

361
00:24:46,852 --> 00:24:49,650
I want to grow old gracefully.
Gettin' old ain't no joke.

362
00:24:49,754 --> 00:24:52,245
It's. Like. You know. When you
see older people... old people...

363
00:24:52,357 --> 00:24:55,053
you gotta really show 'em
some respect and love...

364
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:57,788
'cause there's
a lot of wisdom there.

365
00:24:57,896 --> 00:25:01,093
They're livin' their life.
They got seniority here in this life.

366
00:25:01,199 --> 00:25:03,190
You gotta show 'em
some love. Man.

367
00:25:05,403 --> 00:25:07,837
I know when I get old...
That's why I said until that point...

368
00:25:07,939 --> 00:25:10,669
I'm gonna ride this motherfucker
till the wheels fall off.

369
00:25:10,775 --> 00:25:14,506
Live your life. I'm sure that's what
an old person will tell you.

370
00:25:14,613 --> 00:25:19,448
You think about it. You look around.
This is just a body of life right here.

371
00:25:19,551 --> 00:25:22,111
You got some young.
You got some old and everything.

372
00:25:22,220 --> 00:25:25,018
Just look around. That's what it is.
It goes in a cycle.

373
00:25:25,123 --> 00:25:28,820
You go young. Old. Old. Young.
Young. Old. And that's it.

374
00:25:28,927 --> 00:25:31,122
That's about fuckin' it.
Think about it.

375
00:25:31,229 --> 00:25:33,959
The shit just recycles itself.
Like. The same things happen.

376
00:25:34,065 --> 00:25:37,228
When you're a baby.
you got one tooth.

377
00:25:39,738 --> 00:25:41,706
When you get old...

378
00:25:41,806 --> 00:25:44,434
you got one motherfuckin' tooth
just hanging on. Just...

379
00:25:46,378 --> 00:25:49,313
And that motherfucker
fragiler than a motherfucker.

380
00:25:49,414 --> 00:25:52,941
You gotta cut the apple
to eat the shit. You know.

381
00:25:54,486 --> 00:25:56,454
When you're a baby...

382
00:25:56,555 --> 00:25:59,183
you know what I mean.
you wear diapers.

383
00:25:59,291 --> 00:26:02,351
When you get old. You got
motherfuckin' adult Pampers on.

384
00:26:03,795 --> 00:26:05,956
When you're a baby.
you're in that little walker...

385
00:26:06,064 --> 00:26:08,430
trying to strengthen your legs.
tryin' to walk.

386
00:26:09,768 --> 00:26:12,464
When you get old. You're in
that metal motherfuckin' walker.

387
00:26:13,772 --> 00:26:15,740
You got one patch of hair
when you're a baby.

388
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:18,866
You got a patch of fuckin' hair
when you're old.

389
00:26:18,977 --> 00:26:21,411
You try to cornrow
that motherfucker.

390
00:26:22,647 --> 00:26:25,343
Tryin' to hang on to
what little hip-hop you got left.

391
00:26:26,585 --> 00:26:30,487
It's just a cycle that goes like that.
That's all it is. A cycle.

392
00:26:30,589 --> 00:26:33,752
When I get old... I don't give a fuck...
don't do me no favors.

393
00:26:33,858 --> 00:26:36,418
Leave me at home.
Let me watch the birds. Like I said.

394
00:26:36,528 --> 00:26:38,758
Don't be taking me
to no motherfucking game.

395
00:26:38,863 --> 00:26:41,525
"Martin would want to go
to the basketball game."

396
00:26:41,633 --> 00:26:44,363
They'd take me to the game
and then announce me.

397
00:26:44,469 --> 00:26:47,529
"Ladies and gentlemen. We got
Martin Lawrence in the house."

398
00:26:47,639 --> 00:26:49,607
I'm older than a motherfucker.

399
00:26:51,743 --> 00:26:55,338
All they do is sit you up front
and exploit the fuck out you.

400
00:26:55,447 --> 00:26:57,745
Got the camera
all in your face and shit.

401
00:26:59,284 --> 00:27:02,515
You sittin' there. Can't even
follow the basketball game and shit.

402
00:27:02,621 --> 00:27:04,851
You down here. They playin'
down this motherfucker.

403
00:27:12,497 --> 00:27:15,295
Catch you falling asleep and shit.

404
00:27:23,475 --> 00:27:26,239
Don't put me at no motherfuckin'
game and sit me up front...

405
00:27:26,344 --> 00:27:28,972
puttin' an old-ass
Washington Wizard hat on me.

406
00:27:30,181 --> 00:27:32,911
With Jordan's signature
on the motherfucker.

407
00:27:38,189 --> 00:27:40,157
Talk about...
"How's he like the game?"

408
00:27:40,258 --> 00:27:43,785
"He says it's wonderful."
I ain't said shit.

409
00:27:43,895 --> 00:27:47,888
I said. "Get my ass home.
I don't want to do shit. I'm chillin'."

410
00:27:47,999 --> 00:27:51,400
I'll tell you. The beauty of getting old
is that you do things differently.

411
00:27:51,503 --> 00:27:54,734
Know what I mean? Even your dancin'
changes when you get older.

412
00:27:54,839 --> 00:27:57,774
Young people. They go
do all the wild stuff.

413
00:27:57,876 --> 00:28:01,175
Old people don't do that. They keep it
in one place. "All right. Now.

414
00:28:04,382 --> 00:28:06,441
That's what
I'm talking about right there.

415
00:28:06,551 --> 00:28:10,681
Yeah. Ain't gonna do
too much more than this here tonight.

416
00:28:11,723 --> 00:28:14,886
That's right. Ain't gonna have me
winded out this motherfucker all night.

417
00:28:14,993 --> 00:28:17,359
I got about
two more dips in me now.

418
00:28:18,463 --> 00:28:20,829
One dip. All right.

419
00:28:20,932 --> 00:28:24,663
That's it. That's it.
One more dip. I'm done.

420
00:28:24,769 --> 00:28:28,205
Shit. I'm tired. I ain't gonna be
doin' that shit all night.

421
00:28:28,306 --> 00:28:30,274
You tryin' to kill
a motherfucker."

422
00:28:31,643 --> 00:28:35,238
There's a dance out right now.
A lot of people like this dance.

423
00:28:35,346 --> 00:28:38,179
It's like the... What is it?

424
00:28:38,283 --> 00:28:40,274
It's like the Electric Slide...

425
00:28:40,385 --> 00:28:42,979
but it's not quite
the Electric Slide.

426
00:28:43,088 --> 00:28:45,056
The cha-cha?

427
00:28:45,156 --> 00:28:48,182
Yeah. I can't stand
that fuckin' dance.

428
00:28:48,293 --> 00:28:52,662
That's a easy fuckin' dance. Y'all.
You know that dance is easy as shit.

429
00:28:52,764 --> 00:28:56,598
Come on. "Two to the right.
One to the left.

430
00:28:56,701 --> 00:28:59,135
Stop. Think about it."

431
00:29:00,739 --> 00:29:03,367
Get the fuck out of here
with that shit.

432
00:29:05,677 --> 00:29:07,838
"Take your leg like this here.

433
00:29:09,514 --> 00:29:11,880
Do your arm like this.

434
00:29:13,017 --> 00:29:16,350
Stop. Think about it."

435
00:29:16,454 --> 00:29:18,649
That bullshit.

436
00:29:18,757 --> 00:29:22,193
I know the fuckin' ghetto Hokey Pokey
when I hear that shit.

437
00:29:27,599 --> 00:29:31,296
You know what I mean?
"Do your hip like this one time.

438
00:29:32,637 --> 00:29:35,299
Now keep doing
your hip like this."

439
00:29:36,374 --> 00:29:38,604
Get the fuck outta here.

440
00:29:39,844 --> 00:29:42,438
I respect a brother's hustle.
but that's bullshit. Man.

441
00:29:42,547 --> 00:29:44,708
That shit easy.

442
00:29:45,917 --> 00:29:49,512
You know. The thing about gettin' old.
I'll tell you. Gettin' older is like...

443
00:29:49,621 --> 00:29:53,318
If you have good kids
and you raise good kids...

444
00:29:53,424 --> 00:29:56,018
your children will take care of you
when you're older.

445
00:29:58,396 --> 00:30:00,364
Yeah. That's true.

446
00:30:02,233 --> 00:30:04,463
That's a beautiful thing.
That's what you want.

447
00:30:04,569 --> 00:30:06,867
You want to raise good kids.
I have two beautiful daughters.

448
00:30:06,971 --> 00:30:10,407
And I'm proud of them.
I love them. Thank you.

449
00:30:10,508 --> 00:30:14,706
But you get... Kids will take...
Good kids will take care of you.

450
00:30:14,813 --> 00:30:18,874
But you know them badass kids like
the motherfuckin' Menendez brothers...

451
00:30:18,983 --> 00:30:21,884
you gotta whup their ass. Man.
them little badass kids.

452
00:30:21,986 --> 00:30:24,580
If you don't get them bad kids when
they're young. They will fuck you up.

453
00:30:24,689 --> 00:30:27,180
That's how them brothers did that shit
to their mother and father.

454
00:30:27,292 --> 00:30:29,192
They ought to have
their ass kicked.

455
00:30:29,294 --> 00:30:31,194
I don't like them
badass kids. I tell you.

456
00:30:31,296 --> 00:30:33,730
You gotta get 'em early.
'cause if you don't...

457
00:30:33,832 --> 00:30:35,925
them motherfuckers will
put you in time-out.

458
00:30:38,303 --> 00:30:40,533
They will say. "Get your ass
in time-out. Dad.

459
00:30:40,638 --> 00:30:43,163
Get your fucking time-out. Dad!"

460
00:30:43,274 --> 00:30:45,174
"Goddamn. What did
I do there. Dave?

461
00:30:45,276 --> 00:30:48,370
I don't know what the fuck I did wrong.
What did I do?"

462
00:30:48,479 --> 00:30:50,845
"Just shut the fuck up
and get a time-out!"

463
00:30:52,650 --> 00:30:54,618
You know what I mean?
Telling you shit like...

464
00:30:54,719 --> 00:30:56,880
"Don't touch my Twinkies
in the fridge. Motherfucker.

465
00:30:56,988 --> 00:30:59,548
I'll be home about 9:00."

466
00:30:59,657 --> 00:31:02,455
'Cause they get all tall and lanky.
and they bigger than you and shit.

467
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:04,460
Then they think they run you.

468
00:31:04,562 --> 00:31:07,122
They try to run the phone
that you pay the bill on.

469
00:31:07,232 --> 00:31:09,291
"Hang the motherfuckin'
phone up. Dad!

470
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:12,164
Hang the motherfuckin'
phone up. Dad!

471
00:31:12,270 --> 00:31:14,534
I'm on the phone talkin'
to my homies. Nigger!"

472
00:31:16,307 --> 00:31:19,105
Shit! You gotta get
their little ass. Man.

473
00:31:19,210 --> 00:31:21,576
You gotta let them know.
You gotta put fear in their heart.

474
00:31:21,679 --> 00:31:24,944
"I'm the parent. You ever raise up
on me... I don't play that shit."

475
00:31:25,049 --> 00:31:27,108
They gotta fear you
for the rest of their life...

476
00:31:27,218 --> 00:31:29,243
if they don't fear
no-fucking-body else.

477
00:31:30,388 --> 00:31:32,356
That is yours.

478
00:31:32,457 --> 00:31:35,085
You gotta make 'em know.
You gotta make 'em understand.

479
00:31:35,193 --> 00:31:37,923
Don't play with Daddy.
Don't play with Mama.

480
00:31:38,029 --> 00:31:40,691
But you know what started
some of that shit is that time-out.

481
00:31:41,933 --> 00:31:44,766
White people. Y'all started that.
I ain't pickin' on you.

482
00:31:44,869 --> 00:31:48,396
But that time-out shit?
Uh-uh! Ain't gonna work.

483
00:31:48,506 --> 00:31:51,134
You know. I seen this
white kid tell his mother...

484
00:31:51,242 --> 00:31:54,405
"Fuck you. Mommy. You ho. You bitch.
You ho. You bitch."

485
00:31:54,512 --> 00:31:58,004
All she said was.
"Bobby. Go to time-out.

486
00:31:58,116 --> 00:32:00,084
Go to time-out. Bobby.

487
00:32:00,184 --> 00:32:02,209
You have some emotional issues
that you need to deal with.

488
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:04,288
Go to time-out."

489
00:32:04,389 --> 00:32:06,414
And all the way to time-out.
he sang this shit.

490
00:32:06,524 --> 00:32:09,015
You ho, you bitch
You bitch, you ho

491
00:32:10,094 --> 00:32:11,288
Putting mixes on it.

492
00:32:11,396 --> 00:32:13,990
Bitch, bitch ho

493
00:32:15,433 --> 00:32:17,958
All my bitches
Say ho

494
00:32:19,304 --> 00:32:23,434
Shit! You don't tell
no black parent that shit.

495
00:32:25,109 --> 00:32:27,077
Fuck you, you ho
You bi...

496
00:32:28,346 --> 00:32:29,938
Take time-out.
Pick up your teeth.

497
00:32:32,784 --> 00:32:34,809
Take time-out.
Pick up your wisdoms.

498
00:32:36,287 --> 00:32:38,755
Take time and get my foot
up out your ass.

499
00:32:40,291 --> 00:32:43,783
Fuck the time-out.
That shit don't work.

500
00:32:43,895 --> 00:32:46,921
I know what happens is you're scared
to discipline your child...

501
00:32:47,031 --> 00:32:49,022
'cause now there's a law
that says you can get arrested...

502
00:32:49,133 --> 00:32:51,328
if you whup your child's ass.

503
00:32:51,436 --> 00:32:54,496
Hey. Whup your child's ass...

504
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:57,831
if they act up.

505
00:32:57,942 --> 00:32:59,910
If they're showing off...

506
00:33:00,011 --> 00:33:02,377
If they're showing off.
that's when you whup their ass.

507
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:05,506
Hey. Iook. I got a lot of ass-whuppings.
and look at me now.

508
00:33:09,020 --> 00:33:11,887
But you gotta... If they're showing off.
you gotta tear their ass up.

509
00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:13,958
You can't even be
trippin' on that.

510
00:33:14,058 --> 00:33:16,026
You gotta do
what you gotta do.

511
00:33:16,127 --> 00:33:18,095
I understand
what the law's saying.

512
00:33:18,196 --> 00:33:21,825
You can't be in the street fighting them
like you're in a real fight.

513
00:33:21,933 --> 00:33:23,901
Talkin' about.
"Come on. Fuck that.

514
00:33:24,936 --> 00:33:26,904
You're gonna eat
your Rice Krispies.

515
00:33:27,005 --> 00:33:29,337
You're gonna eat
your Rice Krispies."

516
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:32,967
I understand that shit.
But you know what you gotta do?

517
00:33:33,077 --> 00:33:36,843
You gotta learn how to hit 'em quick
and then walk 'em to the car.

518
00:33:36,948 --> 00:33:38,415
You gotta...

519
00:33:39,550 --> 00:33:41,518
Then walk 'em to the car.

520
00:33:43,855 --> 00:33:46,085
"Hi. Officer. Yeah.

521
00:33:46,190 --> 00:33:48,158
Oh. No. Just out taking
a stroll. That's all.

522
00:33:48,259 --> 00:33:50,227
Yeah. Okeydokey.

You're driving and shit.

525
00:33:56,134 --> 00:33:59,865
"Shut up!

00:33:59,971 --> 00:34:02,872
You like to got my ass arrested.

527
00:34:05,376 --> 00:34:07,970
Shit. That's why
you gotta get 'em.

528
00:34:08,079 --> 00:34:10,047
You gotta scare them.

529
00:34:10,148 --> 00:34:12,116
They could be babies.

530
00:34:12,216 --> 00:34:15,049
Little infants. Little newborns.

531
00:34:15,153 --> 00:34:17,917
You gotta let 'em know.
Instill that fear that you the parent.

532
00:34:18,022 --> 00:34:20,013
You gotta instill
that shit in them!

533
00:34:20,124 --> 00:34:23,252
You go to their motherfucking crib
and wake their ass up.

534
00:34:23,361 --> 00:34:26,091
"What's up. You little motherfucker?

Don't play with me!
This Daddy. Nigger!"

539
00:34:42,013 --> 00:34:44,140
You gotta catch 'em when
they're coming out the pussy.

540
00:34:44,248 --> 00:34:46,375
"What up.

541
00:34:49,654 --> 00:34:52,248

Don't come here.

548
00:35:10,108 --> 00:35:12,838
Best believe. That's the gift
that keeps on giving.

549
00:35:12,944 --> 00:35:15,674
When they 18. 19.
go to them clubs and shit...

550
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:18,180
partying with their friends.
forgetting everything.

551
00:35:18,282 --> 00:35:21,649
They don't know nothing.
Send a prerecorded tape to the DJ.

552
00:35:21,752 --> 00:35:25,188
"Get your little motherfucking
ass home! Nigger. Get home now!"

553
00:35:25,289 --> 00:35:27,314
"Oh. Shit! I gotta go!

554
00:35:27,425 --> 00:35:30,622

00:35:30,728 --> 00:35:34,391
Who mixed him with Tupac?
Who mixed him with Tupac?

556
00:35:34,499 --> 00:35:36,467
Oh. Shit!"

557
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:43,607
Get 'em!

558
00:35:43,708 --> 00:35:47,200
Like I said. That's the gift
that just keeps on giving.

559
00:35:48,179 --> 00:35:50,477
But that's what it's about. Man.

560
00:35:50,581 --> 00:35:53,414
And those are the bad kids.

561
00:35:53,518 --> 00:35:55,486
But you got good kids.

562
00:35:55,586 --> 00:36:00,114
It starts even in the...
in the delivery room...

563
00:36:00,224 --> 00:36:03,352
like when. You know.
the ladies are giving birth.

564
00:36:03,461 --> 00:36:07,693
And I commend you. Ladies. That's
a wonderful thing. Woman. That you do.

565
00:36:07,798 --> 00:36:09,766
I commend you.

566
00:36:09,867 --> 00:36:13,200
To be able to do that is...
It's beautiful.

567
00:36:13,304 --> 00:36:15,795
'Cause I know. Men.
we couldn't do it.

568
00:36:15,907 --> 00:36:18,842
If we had to have babies.
there'd be one motherfucker in here.

569
00:36:20,478 --> 00:36:24,414
But ladies go through that.
and the strength of a woman. Man. Wow!

570
00:36:24,515 --> 00:36:27,712
It's a wonderful thing.
It's beautiful when you see that.

571
00:36:27,818 --> 00:36:31,720
You're getting ready to have the baby.
and the baby's in there.

572
00:36:31,822 --> 00:36:34,723
You gotta be strong. Secure and know
everything's gonna be all right.

573
00:36:34,825 --> 00:36:37,350
'Cause if it's not.
it'll fuck you up.

574
00:36:37,461 --> 00:36:39,827
You stand there
with the nurse and shit looking.

575
00:36:39,931 --> 00:36:41,899
She in the hospital
about to deliver that thing.

576
00:36:41,999 --> 00:36:44,661
You're with the nurse.
"Is she gonna be all right?

577
00:36:44,769 --> 00:36:47,260
'Cause she seems like
she in a lot of pain."

578
00:36:47,371 --> 00:36:50,204
The nurse calming you down.
You got the doctor over there.

579
00:36:50,308 --> 00:36:53,573
Then all of a sudden. The baby
start coming out. And you go...

580
00:36:53,678 --> 00:36:57,580
"Oh. Shit!
Oh. God! Oh!

581
00:36:57,682 --> 00:37:02,619
Look at the head on that
little motherfucker! Oh. Man!

582
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:04,654
Look at the fuckin'
circumference on his head!

583
00:37:04,755 --> 00:37:08,156
Oh. Shit!

584
00:37:08,259 --> 00:37:10,989
He's tearing up the pussy!

585
00:37:12,997 --> 00:37:15,932
That was my fit!
That was my fit!

586
00:37:16,033 --> 00:37:19,025
Oh. Fuck!
Now look at that shit!

587
00:37:19,136 --> 00:37:21,104
All these years
I look for that woman...

588
00:37:21,205 --> 00:37:24,231
I found her. And now
the fit is all fucked up!

589
00:37:25,476 --> 00:37:27,876
I don't know!
Talk to the doctor.

590
00:37:27,979 --> 00:37:30,470
Nothing. Baby. You're doing good.
You're doing real good.

591
00:37:30,581 --> 00:37:33,311
We're just talking about how.
just how well you're doing.

592
00:37:33,417 --> 00:37:35,647
Damn it. Iook how big
that fucking hole is.

593
00:37:37,622 --> 00:37:40,557
Well. You tell me. Nurse.
what am I supposed... Look at that hole!

594
00:37:40,658 --> 00:37:43,456
I can't follow that.

595
00:37:43,561 --> 00:37:46,496
What the fuck am I supposed to do.
fuck her with my knee?

596
00:37:47,765 --> 00:37:50,097
Huh? Do some shit
like this here?

597
00:37:50,201 --> 00:37:52,101
What is that shit?

598
00:37:55,439 --> 00:37:56,906
Oh. Shit.

599
00:38:01,112 --> 00:38:05,173
What the fuck is that big-ass. Twisty.
tied-up baby hanging on?

600
00:38:05,283 --> 00:38:07,183
Oh. God. It looks like a...

601
00:38:07,285 --> 00:38:09,310
Oh. That's the umbilical...
Okay.

602
00:38:09,420 --> 00:38:12,253
Oh. God. Oh. Shit!

603
00:38:12,356 --> 00:38:14,950
I'm nauseous.

604
00:38:15,059 --> 00:38:17,027
Oh. God.
Oh. My God.

605
00:38:17,128 --> 00:38:20,427
What is that fuckin' chitlin bag
hanging out the pussy?

606
00:38:20,531 --> 00:38:22,795
That's a big-ass chitlin bag.

607
00:38:33,010 --> 00:38:35,205
Looks like
a fuckin' gizzard bag.

608
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:38,505
Hold up. Now I'm confused.

609
00:38:38,616 --> 00:38:40,584
Is she a woman.
or is she a fucking turkey?

610
00:38:41,786 --> 00:38:43,754
What the hell is that?"

611
00:38:49,593 --> 00:38:51,060
And then...

612
00:38:55,433 --> 00:38:57,401
And the baby's born.

613
00:38:58,469 --> 00:39:01,905
And then you ain't
as nauseous no more...

614
00:39:02,006 --> 00:39:06,568
'cause you just saw the strength
of a woman. And it turned you on.

615
00:39:06,677 --> 00:39:09,669
You walk up to her.
and the doctor clears out and stuff.

616
00:39:09,780 --> 00:39:12,977
Takes off all his surgical stuff.
You pass him. Damn near passing out.

617
00:39:13,084 --> 00:39:15,484
Talking about.
"I don't know how you do it."

618
00:39:15,586 --> 00:39:18,054
And you come up to her
and say. "Damn. Girl.

619
00:39:19,156 --> 00:39:21,920
You did it. Baby.
Yeah. You did it. You know.

620
00:39:22,026 --> 00:39:24,392
You somethin'.
Yeah. I'll get you some ice chips.

621
00:39:24,495 --> 00:39:27,362
Hold on. Here's some ice chips.
Okay. Yeah. You did it.

622
00:39:27,465 --> 00:39:29,956
I appreciate you. Girl. Yeah."

623
00:39:31,836 --> 00:39:33,571
And you're lookin' at her and stuff.
and you look at the baby.

624
00:39:33,571 --> 00:39:34,970
And you're lookin' at her and stuff.
and you look at the baby.

625
00:39:35,072 --> 00:39:38,098
You say. "Yeah. That's us.
We did that.

626
00:39:38,209 --> 00:39:42,509
It's hard to believe that the night
I had your legs on the chandelier...

627
00:39:42,613 --> 00:39:45,104
that's what we got.

628
00:39:45,216 --> 00:39:48,276
Yeah. Wow. Wow. Baby.

629
00:39:48,386 --> 00:39:50,354
I'm gonna let you get some rest.
all right? I love you.

630
00:39:50,454 --> 00:39:52,422
I'm gonna let you get some rest.
I'll be back.

631
00:39:52,523 --> 00:39:54,423
Okay. All right."

632
00:39:54,525 --> 00:39:57,153
So you start walking out.
and it hits you.

633
00:39:57,261 --> 00:40:01,527
The strength of woman.
that's a sexy fuckin' thing.

634
00:40:01,632 --> 00:40:03,600
You look back at her.

635
00:40:03,701 --> 00:40:07,762
She's so sexy to you now. You're
ready to make another one again.

636
00:40:08,906 --> 00:40:11,932
Your dick start gettin' hard.
and you're looking at her.

637
00:40:12,042 --> 00:40:15,239
You say. "That shit turned me on
like a motherfucker."

638
00:40:16,447 --> 00:40:18,677
But you can't get no pussy
for six weeks.

639
00:40:21,218 --> 00:40:23,948
So now you walking around.
walking around.

640
00:40:24,054 --> 00:40:27,581
You're in the house by yourself. You gotta
go back to the hospital to check on her...

641
00:40:27,691 --> 00:40:30,125
or you stay in the hospital
in another room.

642
00:40:30,227 --> 00:40:33,628
Keep holding your meat in your hand.
You don't wanna beat your meat.

643
00:40:33,731 --> 00:40:36,825
Then you go back down there. And you
check on her a little bit and stuff.

644
00:40:36,934 --> 00:40:40,165
You say.
"Hey. You all right?

645
00:40:41,405 --> 00:40:44,101
Yeah. So it's been a couple
of weeks now. Girl.

646
00:40:46,444 --> 00:40:49,379
Yeah. The doctor say he put
the dissolve stitches in.

647
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:53,780
He said that there is a chance they
could dissolve before six weeks is up.

648
00:40:54,819 --> 00:40:56,912
Okay. Well. Let me take a look there.
Let me take a look.

649
00:40:57,021 --> 00:40:59,615
Open up. Open your legs.

650
00:41:00,991 --> 00:41:04,290
Does it hurt
when I do like that there?

651
00:41:10,835 --> 00:41:14,327
So you don't feel this at all
right here. Like that there?

652
00:41:14,438 --> 00:41:16,099
You don't feel that?
You don't feel that at all?

653
00:41:18,309 --> 00:41:20,607
I'll wait. Shit!"

654
00:41:24,682 --> 00:41:28,345
Then you can't get titty
for. Like. A year.

655
00:41:30,621 --> 00:41:32,589
Ayear you can't get titty?

656
00:41:32,690 --> 00:41:35,250
How long. Ladies. Is it exactly
that you can breast-feed?

657
00:41:35,359 --> 00:41:38,624
- Five years!
- Somebody say five years?

658
00:41:38,729 --> 00:41:41,857
Five years? Oh. Shit.

659
00:41:42,900 --> 00:41:45,232
That ain't breast-feeding.
That's incest.

660
00:41:47,605 --> 00:41:50,733
You're walking around
with a grown person on your titty.

661
00:41:51,842 --> 00:41:55,005
"He's just a little big
for his age."

662
00:41:57,114 --> 00:41:59,241
That motherfucker draggin' his feet.
sucking titty.

663
00:42:05,489 --> 00:42:06,956
Fuck that.

664
00:42:07,057 --> 00:42:10,083
Man. You can't get no titty
for that long. A year. Whatever. Man?

665
00:42:10,194 --> 00:42:12,185
That's hard.
'cause I'm a titty man.

666
00:42:12,296 --> 00:42:14,560
Ooh. I love the titty.

667
00:42:14,665 --> 00:42:18,066
Mm-hmm. It's all right to applaud
the titties. It's all right.

668
00:42:18,168 --> 00:42:20,500
I don't give a fuck
what size the titties are.

669
00:42:20,604 --> 00:42:24,005
They could be big titties.
Just give me a day to work on them.

670
00:42:24,108 --> 00:42:26,474
'Cause I like to
detail a titty real nice.

671
00:42:26,577 --> 00:42:28,477
You know what I mean?
Oh. I like titties.

672
00:42:28,579 --> 00:42:30,479
Big titties. Small titties...

673
00:42:30,581 --> 00:42:34,415
big nipple titties
or small nipple titties.

674
00:42:34,518 --> 00:42:37,112
You know.
it can't just be a nipple.

675
00:42:39,924 --> 00:42:44,418
Okay? Cause I don't want to feel like
I'm kissing on Earl or shit like that.

676
00:42:44,528 --> 00:42:46,962
But there gotta be a little cushion
up under that nip.

677
00:42:47,064 --> 00:42:51,194
Just a little cushion up under the nip.
then we be all right.

678
00:42:51,302 --> 00:42:53,429
I don't give a damn.
They could be saggy titties...

679
00:42:53,537 --> 00:42:55,937
titties that hang to this side...

680
00:42:56,040 --> 00:42:58,304
titties that hang to that side...

681
00:42:58,409 --> 00:43:00,639
titties that hang over
the fucking back.

682
00:43:00,744 --> 00:43:03,440
The ones that get smushy
when you put your finger in 'em...

683
00:43:03,547 --> 00:43:07,005
and you take your hand off. They still
got fingerprints in the motherfucker.

684
00:43:09,019 --> 00:43:11,817
Stretch mark titties.
I don't give a damn.

685
00:43:11,922 --> 00:43:14,288
I lick between the lines.

686
00:43:17,227 --> 00:43:19,457
Like a stamp.

687
00:43:19,563 --> 00:43:21,531
I likes a titty.

688
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:24,991
And when you can't get that titty.
you miss it...

689
00:43:25,102 --> 00:43:27,468
'cause the baby
got the titty on lockdown.

690
00:43:27,571 --> 00:43:29,539
Baby at home...

691
00:43:29,640 --> 00:43:33,337
And you see your wife
or your lady laying in the bed.

692
00:43:33,444 --> 00:43:37,505
You see the baby on one titty and you...
"Damn. Why can't I get some of the tit?"

693
00:43:37,615 --> 00:43:39,515
You know there's an extra titty.

694
00:43:39,617 --> 00:43:42,484
You're like.
"I want some. I want some."

695
00:43:42,586 --> 00:43:45,783
You try to ease over there. Get
a little lick of the titty that's open.

696
00:43:45,889 --> 00:43:48,483
"No. Don't do that!"
"Shit. It's a free titty."

697
00:43:48,592 --> 00:43:50,560
"Don't do that!
It's for the baby.

698
00:43:50,661 --> 00:43:53,027
I gotta switch the baby over."

699
00:43:54,231 --> 00:43:56,199
You're looking. Like. "Damn!"
You try to make up excuses.

700
00:43:56,300 --> 00:44:00,236
"Shit. I got stronger jaws. I'm trying
to help suck the milk up for the baby."

701
00:44:00,337 --> 00:44:02,669
"You've been drinking.
haven't you?

702
00:44:02,773 --> 00:44:06,402
Don't do that.
You'll get alcohol on the titty.

703
00:44:06,510 --> 00:44:08,637
You're gonna get the baby drunk.
Don't do that."

704
00:44:11,148 --> 00:44:14,481
And the baby make the titty
look good. Don't they?

705
00:44:14,585 --> 00:44:17,554
Babies show you
what titty's all about.

706
00:44:18,589 --> 00:44:20,056
Babies...

707
00:44:25,195 --> 00:44:27,959
And they look at you
and roll their eyes.

708
00:44:40,511 --> 00:44:44,345
They will fuckin' show you
what a titty is all about. Man.

709
00:44:44,515 --> 00:44:49,179
Those are some of the things you
go through. Man. In this here life.

710
00:44:49,286 --> 00:44:52,744
Round of applause.
all the couples that are married.

711
00:44:54,858 --> 00:44:57,326
Well. Congratulations
to all four of you.

712
00:44:59,530 --> 00:45:03,466
Now. I used to...
I used to be married.

713
00:45:03,567 --> 00:45:06,297
I'm not married no more. We got
a divorce. It just didn't work out.

714
00:45:06,403 --> 00:45:09,395
But it's hard...
You know. When you...

715
00:45:09,506 --> 00:45:12,134
When you say. "I will marry you"
or "Will you marry me?"

716
00:45:12,242 --> 00:45:15,177
that's like saying.
"Oh. Shit!"

717
00:45:16,580 --> 00:45:19,048
That's why they line you up
like fighters and shit.

718
00:45:19,149 --> 00:45:21,049
And guys be looking
at each other. Going...

719
00:45:21,151 --> 00:45:25,588
"You know. When I finish
announcing these vows...

720
00:45:25,689 --> 00:45:28,658
come out swingin'
like a motherfucker...

721
00:45:28,759 --> 00:45:30,784
'cause it's gonna be
a barn burner."

722
00:45:32,096 --> 00:45:35,554
But all this shit happens at first.
getting ready for the ceremony.

723
00:45:35,666 --> 00:45:38,134
And then you gotta
fill out paperwork...

724
00:45:38,235 --> 00:45:39,600
like if you feel as though
you have something...

725
00:45:39,703 --> 00:45:43,969
that you want to be exclusively yours.
you gotta fill out IOU's.

726
00:45:44,074 --> 00:45:46,065
I'm sorry.
I meant "prenuptials."

727
00:45:48,078 --> 00:45:50,774
That's some hard shit. To tell
somebody that you love 'em...

728
00:45:50,881 --> 00:45:54,715
and then the prenuptial comes into play.
but I guess it is what it is.

729
00:45:54,818 --> 00:45:56,911
But a person will do that.
"You know. I love you.

730
00:45:57,020 --> 00:45:58,988
"We about to do
this thing. Girl.

731
00:45:59,089 --> 00:46:01,421
Yeah. Yeah.
We about to get married.

732
00:46:01,525 --> 00:46:04,016
I'm so proud of you.
So glad we can make this happen.

733
00:46:04,128 --> 00:46:06,858
Yeah. You know. What
excites me about this...

734
00:46:06,964 --> 00:46:09,956
is that. For the rest of our lives.
we're gonna be together.

735
00:46:10,067 --> 00:46:13,662
And. You know. That can't
be changed. You know.

736
00:46:13,771 --> 00:46:18,538
And your world. You know.
is gonna be joined with my world.

737
00:46:18,642 --> 00:46:20,701
My world joined
with your world.

738
00:46:20,811 --> 00:46:23,302
And that's a beautiful thing.
We're gonna have one big world.

739
00:46:23,413 --> 00:46:25,313
That's right.
That's right.

740
00:46:25,415 --> 00:46:27,645
That's right.
I love you too. Yeah.

741
00:46:32,055 --> 00:46:35,582
I need you to fill out
this paper that say...

742
00:46:35,692 --> 00:46:38,525
Yeah. I just need you
to sign this here.

743
00:46:38,629 --> 00:46:41,996
It say if your world
fuck up my world. Okay...

744
00:46:42,099 --> 00:46:45,068
you don't get shit
out of my world. Okay?

745
00:46:45,169 --> 00:46:47,899
You just go the fuck on back
to your world."

746
00:46:48,005 --> 00:46:51,634
That's a hard thing to do
with them prenups and stuff.

747
00:46:51,742 --> 00:46:54,643
Let me ask you a question.
Do you believe in the prenuptials?

748
00:46:59,716 --> 00:47:02,184
Okay. Wow!
Y'all believe in that.

749
00:47:02,286 --> 00:47:04,516
Wow. Who don't believe in it?

750
00:47:06,623 --> 00:47:09,990
Overruled. Overruled!

751
00:47:10,093 --> 00:47:12,357
I see you say. "Uh-uh."
You don't believe in that.

752
00:47:12,462 --> 00:47:15,090
That's cool. That's cool 'cause
you believe that if it's love...

753
00:47:15,199 --> 00:47:17,497
let it be pure
and just roll with that...

754
00:47:17,601 --> 00:47:20,365
and let the heart take over
and see what happens.

755
00:47:20,470 --> 00:47:22,370
That's a beautiful thing.
That's a beautiful thing.

756
00:47:22,472 --> 00:47:25,032
So let me ask you...
This is hypothetically speaking here.

757
00:47:26,443 --> 00:47:29,412
Let's say we was getting married
or some shit. Right?

758
00:47:29,513 --> 00:47:31,481
This is hypothetical. Okay?

759
00:47:31,582 --> 00:47:34,483
And coming into the marriage.
going in...

760
00:47:34,585 --> 00:47:38,077
I got 400 million.
let's say.

761
00:47:39,189 --> 00:47:41,680
And that's what
I'm coming in with...

762
00:47:41,792 --> 00:47:45,193
and... you comin' in with a bag.

763
00:47:49,867 --> 00:47:52,233
You still think you should
get some of that 400 mil?

764
00:47:52,336 --> 00:47:54,964
- Half and half.
- Yeah. You be leaving.

765
00:47:55,072 --> 00:47:57,040
"Damn. That's fucked up.

766
00:47:57,140 --> 00:47:59,233
You could put something
in this bag."

767
00:48:01,378 --> 00:48:04,575
I guess I can't answer that.
I guess to each his own.

768
00:48:04,681 --> 00:48:06,581
Fellas. I don't know.
I ain't no doctor.

769
00:48:06,683 --> 00:48:09,379
I ain't no psychologist.
But I'm gonna tell you like this.

770
00:48:09,486 --> 00:48:11,613
If a woman tell you she a virgin
and you gettin' ready to marry her...

771
00:48:11,722 --> 00:48:13,849
test that pussy out
before you marry her.

772
00:48:13,957 --> 00:48:15,857
That's just the way it goes.
Don't do it.

773
00:48:15,959 --> 00:48:18,689
Don't get into it.
and then it ain't what you want.

774
00:48:18,795 --> 00:48:21,195
You never know.
You gotta test that pussy out.

775
00:48:21,298 --> 00:48:23,596
'Cause if you marry 'em
and then get it...

776
00:48:23,700 --> 00:48:26,965
and wind up falling in the pussy.
you'd be. "Oh. Shit!"

777
00:48:27,070 --> 00:48:30,767
You'd be in the land of Oz
out that motherfucker.

778
00:48:30,874 --> 00:48:33,638
"Where the fuck am I?
Is this fallopian? Is this fallopian?"

779
00:48:35,712 --> 00:48:37,680
So you gotta test it out.

780
00:48:37,781 --> 00:48:40,773
It's just like you test-drive
a car or something.

781
00:48:40,884 --> 00:48:43,216
You take a car around the corner.
bring it back to the dealer...

782
00:48:43,320 --> 00:48:45,880
"Naw. I ain't gonna be able
to get this. Cuz.

783
00:48:45,989 --> 00:48:48,014
Yeah. Naw. Naw. Naw. Naw.
Fuck that. Dude.

784
00:48:48,125 --> 00:48:51,219
The wheels. They don't rotate right
on this motherfucker."

785
00:48:51,328 --> 00:48:56,425
Test it out. If you don't check
before you get married. Fuck around...

786
00:48:56,533 --> 00:48:59,434
wind up marrying
a hermaphrodite.

787
00:49:01,571 --> 00:49:04,233
That's right. You thought
that was a big-ass clit.

788
00:49:04,341 --> 00:49:06,866
Turned out to be a dick.

789
00:49:08,278 --> 00:49:11,111
Now you fucked up.
You're..."Oh. Shit."

790
00:49:11,214 --> 00:49:14,206
Can't talk to your boys and shit.
"What's up. Dog?"

791
00:49:16,286 --> 00:49:20,484
"I married somebody with a fuckin' dick
I thought was a clit."

792
00:49:20,590 --> 00:49:22,558
You don't want to do that.

793
00:49:23,860 --> 00:49:25,953
Clit so big.
it looked like a thumb.

794
00:49:28,765 --> 00:49:30,858
So check it out.
Ain't nothin' wrong with that.

795
00:49:30,968 --> 00:49:32,936
Ladies. The same with you.

796
00:49:33,036 --> 00:49:35,436
Don't marry no man that you
don't know what you gettin'.

797
00:49:37,274 --> 00:49:39,674
Yeah. You gotta marry that man.
you gonna know what you gettin'.

798
00:49:39,776 --> 00:49:42,040
'Cause if not.
you marry him and don't know...

799
00:49:42,145 --> 00:49:45,046
you gonna be a bitter housewife on the
phone with your girlfriend. Crying...

800
00:49:45,148 --> 00:49:47,048
"You ain't gonna believe

801
00:49:47,150 --> 00:49:50,551
Damn it. You ain't gonna

00:49:50,654 --> 00:49:53,452
This motherfucker

803
00:49:53,557 --> 00:49:56,924
The best thing about it

804
00:49:58,028 --> 00:50:01,156
Ah. Shit!

805
00:50:01,264 --> 00:50:03,232
You don't want
to go through that.

806
00:50:03,333 --> 00:50:05,927
That's why what you do...

807
00:50:06,036 --> 00:50:08,061

You grab him. Iook at it.

808

00:50:17,180 --> 00:50:20,172
And look at it.
Look on the head.

811
00:50:20,283 --> 00:50:24,515
Look on the sides.
Look up under the balls.

812
00:50:24,621 --> 00:50:28,113
Look at it and ask questions.

813
00:50:28,225 --> 00:50:31,319
"What's those two bumps
right there?

814
00:50:37,134 --> 00:50:40,467
What's those two bumps
on your helmet?

815
00:50:42,439 --> 00:50:45,408
Well. Have you tried putting
Mercurochrome on that?

816
00:50:45,509 --> 00:50:48,376
No. You haven't. Huh?
Okay.

817
00:50:50,380 --> 00:50:52,644
Why you got a boil
up under your balls?

818
00:50:54,918 --> 00:50:56,886
That is a boil. Okay?

819
00:50:56,987 --> 00:51:00,320
That is not a hair bump.
That is a boil.

820
00:51:02,225 --> 00:51:04,159
Uh-huh.
Okay. Hold up. Wait.

821
00:51:04,261 --> 00:51:06,855
Fuck this.
Hold on. Wait.

822
00:51:06,963 --> 00:51:10,262
Okay. Now you got a boil...

823
00:51:11,301 --> 00:51:14,793
two balls and two bumps?

824
00:51:16,006 --> 00:51:19,305
Uh-uh. I ain't gonna be
able to do it.

825
00:51:20,343 --> 00:51:22,743
No. I ain't gonna
be able to do it.

826
00:51:25,549 --> 00:51:27,676
I am not marrying
no Nutty Buddy.

827
00:51:30,187 --> 00:51:32,883
I'm not gonna be able to do it.

828
00:51:32,989 --> 00:51:36,584
That is too many bumps

829
00:51:36,693 --> 00:51:39,526
Dick look like a Crunch Bar.
I'm sorry. I just...

830
00:51:39,629 --> 00:51:43,121
I can't do it. I won't do it.
I just won't."

831
00:51:49,673 --> 00:51:54,269
Talk and communicate...
so you know these things.

832
00:51:54,377 --> 00:51:58,711
And so you check... You know what
you're getting and you can be happy.

833
00:51:58,815 --> 00:52:02,080
Make him get butt naked.
Tell your man. "Butt naked."

834
00:52:02,185 --> 00:52:04,085
Tell him to line up right.
Look at him.

835
00:52:04,187 --> 00:52:06,212
Make sure the dick
is in line right.

836
00:52:06,323 --> 00:52:09,724
Make sure it's straight.
Make sure. Okay?

837
00:52:09,826 --> 00:52:11,794
If you don't do that. You'll wind
up marrying a motherfucker...

838
00:52:11,895 --> 00:52:14,125
with a hook in his dick.

839
00:52:14,231 --> 00:52:16,256
Gotta fuck you like this.

840
00:52:30,113 --> 00:52:32,274
You don't want that.
You don't need that pressure.

841
00:52:34,985 --> 00:52:38,079
You should not have to go around
the corner every time he wants to fuck.

842
00:52:40,390 --> 00:52:43,359
"It's just better for my balance.
I got you. You feel me now?

843
00:52:43,460 --> 00:52:46,258
You feel me now. Don't you?
You feel me?"

844
00:52:46,363 --> 00:52:49,161
Chasing you
around the room and shit.

845
00:52:51,801 --> 00:52:55,032
So please. Check all those things.

846
00:52:55,138 --> 00:52:57,663
And then when you're ready
to get married. You get married.

847
00:52:57,774 --> 00:53:00,106
And you're ready
for the ceremony.

848
00:53:11,087 --> 00:53:13,612
Ladies love them ceremonies.
Don't you. Ladies?

849
00:53:13,723 --> 00:53:16,988
You love to invite people you love
and people you hate.

850
00:53:17,093 --> 00:53:21,587
And look at them women that's looking
at you going. "Look at me. Bitch.

851
00:53:21,698 --> 00:53:23,928
Look how I float. Bitch."

852
00:53:33,009 --> 00:53:36,172
And ladies love
to wear that white.

853
00:53:36,279 --> 00:53:38,372
With the veil

854
00:53:39,849 --> 00:53:41,817
'Cause white
stands for pure.

855
00:53:45,655 --> 00:53:48,556
White. Pure. White.
Come on!

856
00:53:49,693 --> 00:53:53,652
Some of y'all need to be

857
00:53:55,565 --> 00:53:57,658
Tease 'em taupe.

858
00:53:59,703 --> 00:54:02,695
Sneaky salmon.

859
00:54:02,806 --> 00:54:05,673
Money green.
All that shit.

860
00:54:05,775 --> 00:54:08,243
Talkin' about wearing white...

861
00:54:08,345 --> 00:54:11,337
knowing they done
fucked the usher last week.

862
00:54:11,448 --> 00:54:13,416
Come on. Now. Wear your color.

863
00:54:13,516 --> 00:54:15,916
That's all I ask.
Wear your color.

864
00:54:17,754 --> 00:54:20,746
Marriage. Man.
It's hard. It ain't easy.

865
00:54:20,857 --> 00:54:22,757
I'll tell you.
One thing I did come to learn.

866
00:54:22,859 --> 00:54:25,760
A lot of people that are married.
you know. Either...

867
00:54:25,862 --> 00:54:30,128
Someone in the marriage
either smokes herb or drinks.

868
00:54:33,536 --> 00:54:36,937
"Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah."
That's some true shit. Ain't it?

869
00:54:37,040 --> 00:54:39,941
I got some partners. "Yeah. Yeah.
I got to go home to the wife. Yo.

870
00:54:40,043 --> 00:54:42,705
She get on my nerves every time
I go in that motherfuckin' door.

871
00:54:42,812 --> 00:54:45,940
Yeah. Yeah.
Roll me one of them blunts. Joe.

872
00:54:46,049 --> 00:54:48,779
Roll me one of them motherfuckers.
Yeah. Make that a fat one. Man.

873
00:54:48,885 --> 00:54:51,854
When I smoke that shit. Man. That
bitch look like Janet Jackson. Nigger."

874
00:54:55,158 --> 00:54:58,958
Or they drink. If you check all
the bars. They're mostly married men.

875
00:54:59,062 --> 00:55:02,589
Just look at it. They're mostly married.
and they in there dreading going home.

876
00:55:02,699 --> 00:55:05,759
They in the bar.
"Oh. Shit.

877
00:55:05,869 --> 00:55:09,999
Make me another drink. Earl.
Oh. God. I got to go home to the wife.

878
00:55:10,106 --> 00:55:13,701
Yeah. I don't know. Earl.
You know what? Make it a double.

879
00:55:13,810 --> 00:55:18,509
She wants to fuck tonight. Oh. God.
Well. Here's to her. Oh. God."

880
00:55:20,717 --> 00:55:25,051
They go in the house. "Honey. I'm home."
They start drinking some more.

881
00:55:25,155 --> 00:55:27,055
The in-house drunk
is a motherfuck...

882
00:55:27,157 --> 00:55:29,057
'cause he says things
when he gets drinkin'...

883
00:55:29,159 --> 00:55:31,753
and once that alcohol hits his system...

884
00:55:31,861 --> 00:55:34,796
that he probably
is just out of order for sayin'.

885
00:55:34,898 --> 00:55:38,834
But he don't realize it
'cause he's so drunk. And now...

886
00:55:38,935 --> 00:55:42,871
that liquor taps into his emotions.
and he starts tellin' this woman...

887
00:55:42,972 --> 00:55:45,532
everything he's been wantin'
to say when he was sober.

888
00:55:45,642 --> 00:55:47,610
But he don't have the courage
to say it when he's sober...

889
00:55:47,711 --> 00:55:50,043
and he says it when he's drunk.

890
00:55:51,848 --> 00:55:55,079
"Darlin'. Do me a favor.
will you? Mm-hmm.

891
00:55:55,185 --> 00:55:58,484
Yes. Baby. It's so good.
I'm glad I'm home. Mm-hmm.

892
00:55:58,588 --> 00:56:02,046
Yeah. I think about you all day.
Mm-hmm. I'm glad.

893
00:56:02,158 --> 00:56:06,219
Do me a favor. Never mind all that.
Would you make me a drink. Darlin'?

894
00:56:06,329 --> 00:56:08,627
Yeah. Uh-huh.
Just a little Courvoisier.

895
00:56:10,567 --> 00:56:13,195
Put a little something in that glass
for me right there. Darlin'.

896
00:56:13,303 --> 00:56:15,271
Thank you so much. Baby.

897
00:56:17,574 --> 00:56:19,565
Yeah. That's good Courvoisier.

898
00:56:20,610 --> 00:56:23,170
Make you say yea.

899
00:56:25,882 --> 00:56:29,784
Darlin'. Put a couple of cubes of ice
in there. Cut that warmth off for me.

900
00:56:29,886 --> 00:56:33,481
Thank you. Baby.
Mm-hmm.

901
00:56:37,127 --> 00:56:39,095
That is a good drink there!

902
00:56:39,195 --> 00:56:42,460
That is a good drink there!

903
00:56:47,270 --> 00:56:49,238
That's my drink there.

904
00:56:51,040 --> 00:56:53,008
That is my drink.

905
00:57:06,956 --> 00:57:08,924
Can I ask you something?

906
00:57:12,362 --> 00:57:15,422
When the fuck
you gonna grow your hair back?

907
00:57:15,532 --> 00:57:19,298
I'm tired. Yes. I said.
Yes. Tired.

908
00:57:19,402 --> 00:57:22,428
Uh-huh. You're a bald-headed
little motherfucker.

909
00:57:22,539 --> 00:57:25,770
You told me
you was gettin' the...

910
00:57:25,875 --> 00:57:28,275
the Halle Berry look.

911
00:57:30,814 --> 00:57:32,782
Halle Berry don't look
like that.

912
00:57:34,451 --> 00:57:36,476
I feel like you set me up.

913
00:57:37,854 --> 00:57:39,321
Motherfucker.

914
00:57:40,390 --> 00:57:43,154
I don't give a shit.

915
00:57:45,829 --> 00:57:49,458
Darlin'. Put one more cube
of ice in there for me.

916
00:57:49,566 --> 00:57:51,659
Cut that warmth.
Thank you. Doll.

917
00:57:54,704 --> 00:57:57,172
That was good.

918
00:57:57,273 --> 00:57:59,173
Can I ask you something?

919
00:58:00,710 --> 00:58:05,147
How is it you got more motherfuckin'
shavin' bumps than me?

920
00:58:13,957 --> 00:58:16,551
How you got more?

921
00:58:16,659 --> 00:58:18,650
How is it you got more?

922
00:58:18,761 --> 00:58:22,128
I don't give a fuck.
I don't give a fuck.

923
00:58:23,366 --> 00:58:26,267
Every week. You tellin' me...

924
00:58:26,369 --> 00:58:29,338
you gonna
get your lip waxed.

925
00:58:30,540 --> 00:58:33,441
You might as well just let 'em
take the whole lip.

926
00:58:35,245 --> 00:58:38,009
'Cause that shit
sitting out there like Sasquatch.

927
00:58:39,949 --> 00:58:42,645
Fuck that. Fuck that.

928
00:58:42,752 --> 00:58:45,812
If I wanted to marry Scottie
from the Whisper Bitch...

929
00:58:45,922 --> 00:58:47,890
I would've married him.

930
00:58:49,692 --> 00:58:52,991
Motherfucker. Fuck that.
Fuck that. I said it. Huh?

931
00:58:57,233 --> 00:59:00,760
That's because I feel bad
about it. Girl. Okay?

932
00:59:00,870 --> 00:59:02,838
I said. 'Okay? '

933
00:59:05,241 --> 00:59:09,405
Okay? You didn't
talk to me about it.

934
00:59:09,512 --> 00:59:12,709
When you first gained
five pounds...

935
00:59:12,815 --> 00:59:14,077
that was cute.

936
00:59:14,183 --> 00:59:18,313
I'm-a admit. I'm-a admit that. Okay?
That was cute.

937
00:59:18,421 --> 00:59:21,857
But 75 pounds? Goddamn!

938
00:59:21,958 --> 00:59:24,620
What kind of fuckin' fool
you take me for?

939
00:59:26,829 --> 00:59:29,525
My motherfuckin' ankles
is still swollen...

940
00:59:29,632 --> 00:59:31,998
from the last time
we toyed around.

941
00:59:34,337 --> 00:59:36,965
Look at you.
Oh. God. Look at you.

942
00:59:39,042 --> 00:59:41,442
That is a good drink there.

943
00:59:42,779 --> 00:59:44,747
I remember when I met you.

944
00:59:46,416 --> 00:59:50,648
You was a 115 tender bone.

945
00:59:52,021 --> 00:59:53,989
Yes. You was.

946
00:59:54,090 --> 00:59:58,390
You was the finest thing
my eyes ever seen.

947
00:59:59,429 --> 01:00:03,456
You was a round-the-way girl.

948
01:00:05,101 --> 01:00:07,695
Now you just a big bitch
from up the street.

949
01:00:08,805 --> 01:00:10,773
Goddamn! Huh?

950
01:00:14,143 --> 01:00:15,667
Motherfucker!

951
01:00:15,778 --> 01:00:17,507
I don't give a damn.

952
01:00:17,614 --> 01:00:19,548
Don't give a damn.

953
01:00:19,649 --> 01:00:21,549
And I don't like your mother
and your family.

954
01:00:21,651 --> 01:00:24,245
I don't like
none of you motherfuckers.

955
01:00:24,354 --> 01:00:28,688
Every year... Every year
we gotta do the family thing.

956
01:00:28,791 --> 01:00:30,691
Everybody brings potluck.

957
01:00:30,793 --> 01:00:33,353
Fuck that! None of you
motherfuckers can cook.

958
01:00:34,163 --> 01:00:37,189
And your mother... Tell her to
stay the fuck out of my face.

959
01:00:37,300 --> 01:00:39,029
Always in my face.

960
01:00:40,136 --> 01:00:43,537
'How was my macaroni and cheese? '

961
01:00:43,640 --> 01:00:45,130
It's fucked up. Bitch!

962
01:00:47,210 --> 01:00:51,544
Don't nobody put pasteurized cheese
in macaroni and cheese.

963
01:00:51,648 --> 01:00:53,047
You got to use cheddar.

964
01:00:53,883 --> 01:00:55,942
Cheddar's what you use.

965
01:00:56,052 --> 01:00:57,952
My mama taught me that.

966
01:01:09,666 --> 01:01:11,133
I don't care!

967
01:01:13,503 --> 01:01:16,404
I'm looking at you.
and I can't imagine it.

968
01:01:18,041 --> 01:01:20,942
There should be a clause
in my contract that says...

969
01:01:21,044 --> 01:01:25,208
if your ass gets bigger than
what you weighed in when we married...

970
01:01:25,314 --> 01:01:27,714
I don't have to fuck with you.

971
01:01:35,558 --> 01:01:37,458
Fuck it. Be a man.

972
01:01:45,168 --> 01:01:49,002
You was... When I first met you...
Darlin'. I'm gonna say this.

973
01:01:49,105 --> 01:01:51,505
You were looking good from afar.

974
01:01:52,642 --> 01:01:55,304
Now you're just far
from looking good.

975
01:02:00,216 --> 01:02:01,979
I don't like you...

976
01:02:02,085 --> 01:02:04,451
and you don't like me. Okay?

977
01:02:05,254 --> 01:02:07,722
I'm taking karate every day!

978
01:02:09,158 --> 01:02:11,092
I'm taking kung fu.

979
01:02:11,194 --> 01:02:12,991
I'm taking jujitsu.

980
01:02:13,096 --> 01:02:15,223
I'm taking all the martial arts.

981
01:02:15,331 --> 01:02:17,765
I'm trying to master that shit...

982
01:02:17,867 --> 01:02:22,327
so I can figure out how to
choke the fucking life out your ass...

983
01:02:22,438 --> 01:02:25,339
without them tracing it
back to forensics...

984
01:02:25,441 --> 01:02:27,341
you big bitch. You.

985
01:02:32,882 --> 01:02:34,281
You know what?

986
01:02:36,185 --> 01:02:39,643
Let me put this drink down
before I say some shit I shouldn't say."

987
01:02:50,597 --> 01:02:54,328
Wow. But you know the ladies ain't
gonna let you get away with that shit.

988
01:02:54,434 --> 01:02:58,131
You gonna pay the price for that.
You know what I mean?

989
01:02:58,238 --> 01:03:02,072
'Cause she will wake your ass up.
cuss you out..."Fuck you! Get your ass up!"

990
01:03:02,175 --> 01:03:05,804
You wake up and you don't even know
why you're up or what happened.

991
01:03:05,912 --> 01:03:10,178
"What's the problem?" "You know what
the problem is. You dirty bastard!

992
01:03:10,283 --> 01:03:13,184
I got big 'cause I don't
want your ass. Motherfucker.

993
01:03:13,286 --> 01:03:15,948
You're so ugly.
you look like we got a dog.

994
01:03:16,055 --> 01:03:19,388
That's what the neighbors think.
you bastard."

995
01:03:19,492 --> 01:03:20,720
They get angry.

996
01:03:20,827 --> 01:03:25,389
They will take it in. And they will be quiet
and let you talk shit and all that...

997
01:03:25,498 --> 01:03:26,897
but they getting you back.

998
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:30,561
If you ever wake up sore...
I mean. Really fucked up. Hurtin'...

999
01:03:30,670 --> 01:03:34,629
nine times out of ten you got
your ass whupped in your sleep.

1000
01:03:35,842 --> 01:03:39,107
And the only reason why you didn't
wake up is 'cause you was out.

1001
01:03:39,212 --> 01:03:41,476
That liquor had your ass out.

1002
01:03:41,581 --> 01:03:43,640
They running through
the motherfuckin' house...

1003
01:04:22,522 --> 01:04:24,422
You wake up the next day...

1004
01:04:24,524 --> 01:04:25,582
"My neck!

1005
01:04:25,692 --> 01:04:27,592
My motherfucking neck!

1006
01:04:35,602 --> 01:04:38,070
I don't know what's wrong with me!

1007
01:04:38,171 --> 01:04:40,571
I don't know what's wrong...
This morning...

1008
01:04:40,673 --> 01:04:42,231
What's wrong with me?"

1009
01:04:43,343 --> 01:04:45,140
She just gonna look at you...

1010
01:04:45,245 --> 01:04:48,737
"Maybe you should stop
drinking Courvoisier."

1011
01:04:50,483 --> 01:04:53,611
Be careful. Man.
That shit can happen.

1012
01:04:54,420 --> 01:04:56,888
I don't know if you guys
saw the film.

1013
01:04:56,990 --> 01:04:59,390
It kind of highlighted my life.

1014
01:05:00,860 --> 01:05:03,693
You know. Through it all...

1015
01:05:03,796 --> 01:05:06,321
I come to learn
what I got to do in my life...

1016
01:05:06,432 --> 01:05:11,301
What we all gotta do in our life is ride
this motherfucker till the wheels fall off.

1017
01:05:11,404 --> 01:05:13,668
We gotta live.
Ride it till the wheels fall off.

1018
01:05:15,608 --> 01:05:18,771
You might have looked at the tape.
It said one day I was...

1019
01:05:19,879 --> 01:05:21,779
I was out in the street.

1020
01:05:23,082 --> 01:05:26,745
This is some shit they said about...
They had it highlighted.

1021
01:05:26,853 --> 01:05:29,185
They said I was
out in the street...

1022
01:05:29,289 --> 01:05:33,282
and I was yelling stuff
out in the street and doing stuff.

1023
01:05:33,393 --> 01:05:36,294
Listen. Y'all.
I was married at the time.

1024
01:05:36,396 --> 01:05:39,126
Now. I'm not blaming that
for that. Okay?

1025
01:05:39,232 --> 01:05:42,565
But. Okay. At the time...
I'm gonna tell you what happened.

1026
01:05:42,669 --> 01:05:46,571
'Cause that's how they
put their story down. Okay?

1027
01:05:46,673 --> 01:05:48,937
I'm gonna tell it.
But that's how they do theirs.

1028
01:05:49,042 --> 01:05:50,600
But. See. L...

1029
01:05:50,710 --> 01:05:53,611
The day that all that went down...

1030
01:05:55,348 --> 01:05:56,940
I'm gonna tell it.

1031
01:05:57,050 --> 01:05:59,678
The day that all that went down...

1032
01:05:59,786 --> 01:06:03,984
I was married. And the wife asked me to
go to the store to get something to eat.

1033
01:06:04,090 --> 01:06:08,117
And being the good husband that I am.
I said. "Sure. I'll go."

1034
01:06:08,227 --> 01:06:11,355
Now that I think about it.
I don't know why I was out there...

1035
01:06:11,464 --> 01:06:13,557
getting something to eat
at McDonald's...

1036
01:06:13,666 --> 01:06:17,124
when. As hard as I work. I should've
had a home-cooked fuckin' meal.

1037
01:06:18,237 --> 01:06:19,363
You know?

1038
01:06:19,472 --> 01:06:21,269
But then again...

1039
01:06:21,374 --> 01:06:24,070
I should've asked that question
that day.

1040
01:06:25,178 --> 01:06:27,078
So I go out in the street...

1041
01:06:27,180 --> 01:06:30,081
and I go to run across the street...
I was trying to catch the light.

1042
01:06:30,183 --> 01:06:32,549
I go to run
across the street and...

1043
01:06:32,652 --> 01:06:35,086
because how the light changed. I got
caught in the middle of the street.

1044
01:06:35,188 --> 01:06:39,124
Next thing I know.
they got firemen. They got ambulance...

1045
01:06:39,225 --> 01:06:43,161
they got the police. Everybody out
there with guns... all of'em had guns...

1046
01:06:43,262 --> 01:06:46,595
just because I tried to
run across the street.

1047
01:06:47,834 --> 01:06:51,235
No. I'm fucking with you.
I was higher than a motherfucker. Y'all.

1048
01:06:54,140 --> 01:06:56,267
I was high as shit!

1049
01:06:57,377 --> 01:06:59,277
Oh. My fuckin' goodness!

1050
01:07:00,380 --> 01:07:01,745
Oh!

1051
01:07:01,848 --> 01:07:04,749
I was smokin' that ooh-wee!

1052
01:07:06,352 --> 01:07:09,753
That shit done had me
all lunch-box.

1053
01:07:11,724 --> 01:07:14,192
I should have known
something was wrong.

1054
01:07:14,293 --> 01:07:18,525
I start blazin' that shit.
and I knew I started seeing blue smoke...

1055
01:07:18,631 --> 01:07:21,361
but the shit didn't hit me
till I'm walking in the street.

1056
01:07:21,467 --> 01:07:24,527
Some shit said.
"Run real fast right now."

1057
01:07:33,279 --> 01:07:35,440
Fuckin' runnin' in the street!

1058
01:07:35,548 --> 01:07:37,448
Fuckin' with the ooh-wee!

1059
01:07:40,253 --> 01:07:41,880
I'm running like crazy.

1060
01:07:41,988 --> 01:07:44,889
What kind of shit
has the dope man sold me?

1061
01:07:46,125 --> 01:07:50,084
I'm in that motherfucker just
ducking cars. Fucking with the cars...

1062
01:07:50,196 --> 01:07:53,222
jumping out the way.

1063
01:07:59,872 --> 01:08:02,397
Next thing you know.

1064
01:08:02,508 --> 01:08:04,942
police and firemen
and the ambulance...

1065
01:08:05,044 --> 01:08:07,911
"Mr. Lawrence. Son. What's wrong?
Calm down!"

1066
01:08:08,014 --> 01:08:11,472
And I'm up there looking at them.

1068
01:08:18,291 --> 01:08:20,486
I start singing...
How come I feel like

1069
01:08:20,593 --> 01:08:22,686
Somebody's watching me

1070
01:08:23,863 --> 01:08:27,264
I start singing Rockwell
up in that motherfucker.

1071
01:08:27,366 --> 01:08:31,268
I said. "That dope man
done sold me the ooh-wee."

1072
01:08:31,370 --> 01:08:32,997
Oh. Shit.

1073
01:08:33,106 --> 01:08:35,768
I seen all of them. And I thought
my audience had changed...

1074
01:08:35,875 --> 01:08:38,776
so I start performing for 'em.

1075
01:08:54,093 --> 01:08:55,617

01:09:04,070 --> 01:09:06,766
My arm hit my jacket...

1080
01:09:06,873 --> 01:09:09,000
and my jacket flew open.

1081
01:09:09,108 --> 01:09:11,201
And they gonna say I had a gun
'cause my jacket...

1082
01:09:11,310 --> 01:09:13,574
I did have a gun.

1083
01:09:13,679 --> 01:09:15,169
That's true. I did.

1084
01:09:15,281 --> 01:09:17,340
But I ain't have it
to hurt nobody.

1085
01:09:17,450 --> 01:09:21,147
I just have it 'cause I'm by myself.
I didn't know if somebody would jump me.

1086
01:09:21,254 --> 01:09:23,552
Bang-bang-bang-bang.
Trigger tai chi.

1087
01:09:23,656 --> 01:09:25,851
I didn't know. You know.

1088
01:09:25,958 --> 01:09:28,017
But I wasn't trying
to hurt nobody.

1089
01:09:28,127 --> 01:09:29,685
Next thing you know...

1090
01:09:29,795 --> 01:09:32,923
when they saw that gun.
these motherfuckers loaded up.

1091
01:09:33,032 --> 01:09:36,593
Every one of them... the firemen.
ambulance. Everybody pulled out guns.

1092
01:09:36,702 --> 01:09:40,229
Yes. Sir. And I heard somebody yell.
"Nigger with gun! Nigger with gun!"

1093
01:09:41,507 --> 01:09:42,838
They got ready to fire.

1094
01:09:42,942 --> 01:09:44,773
I passed out like a motherfucker.

1095
01:09:47,413 --> 01:09:51,315
Somebody done fucked around
and sold me the ooh-wee.

1096
01:09:54,787 --> 01:09:56,687
I passed the fuck out. Y'all.

1097
01:09:57,790 --> 01:09:59,485
And I'm on the motherfuckin'...

1098
01:10:00,626 --> 01:10:03,094
I wake up. I don't know.
ten minutes. Fifteen...

1099
01:10:03,196 --> 01:10:05,596
I wasn't countin' time.

1100
01:10:07,066 --> 01:10:09,933
And they had me on a gurney...

1101
01:10:10,036 --> 01:10:12,527
with cameramen and everybody
in my fuckin' face...

1102
01:10:12,638 --> 01:10:15,539
flashing pictures
for y'all to see on the news.

1103
01:10:16,742 --> 01:10:20,109
Then they put me in a...
in a paddy wagon...

1104
01:10:21,647 --> 01:10:23,638
slash-ambulance.

1105
01:10:25,818 --> 01:10:28,150
They want to show
that they cared...

1106
01:10:28,254 --> 01:10:31,280
but I'm lunchin'. So they're gonna
take me to jail or some shit.

1107
01:10:31,390 --> 01:10:35,292
So they're ready to take me to jail.
but I'm in there talking shit...

1108
01:10:35,394 --> 01:10:38,830
singing on the bed. Or the gurney.
laying there singing shit.

1109
01:10:38,931 --> 01:10:42,867
That just didn't sound right..."We're
gonna have to take you to the precinct."

1110
01:10:42,969 --> 01:10:44,937
And I'm lunchin' and shit.
and I say...

1111
01:10:45,037 --> 01:10:47,437
"Monkeys like to play volleyball."

1112
01:10:50,176 --> 01:10:51,768
I'm laying there...

1113
01:10:51,877 --> 01:10:53,936
"Pit bulls like to wear Jordans."

1114
01:10:55,047 --> 01:10:57,948
That's when they realized
I was sicker than they thought.

1115
01:10:58,050 --> 01:11:02,350
They said. "He's got something
in his system that got him sick-witted.

1116
01:11:02,455 --> 01:11:05,356
Fuck taking him to jail.
Let's take him to the hospital."

1117
01:11:05,458 --> 01:11:07,585
Them motherfuckers
rushed me to the hospital...

1118
01:11:07,693 --> 01:11:10,890
put me in a padded room
with just a big-ass mirror...

1119
01:11:10,997 --> 01:11:13,989
where you could kind of see through...
You knew they was on the other side.

1120
01:11:14,100 --> 01:11:17,536
And I didn't help. 'cause I'm
still in there lunchin' and shit.

1121
01:11:18,638 --> 01:11:21,004
Working on moves and shit.

1122
01:11:21,107 --> 01:11:22,836
Two to the right.

1123
01:11:22,942 --> 01:11:24,341
One to the left.

1124
01:11:24,443 --> 01:11:25,842
Think about it.

1125
01:11:27,146 --> 01:11:28,477
Lunchin'.

1126
01:11:28,581 --> 01:11:30,105
Fuckin' lunchin'.

1127
01:11:32,952 --> 01:11:35,352
Then a doctor came in. Y'all.

1128
01:11:35,454 --> 01:11:39,185
He was a fan of the show. And he really
wanted to see me get out of there.

1129
01:11:39,292 --> 01:11:43,661
He said. "Listen. Son. I'm a doctor.
I'm not here to hurt you."

1130
01:11:43,763 --> 01:11:46,823
I'm moving. Can't stay still.
and he's a little nervous.

1131
01:11:46,932 --> 01:11:51,198
He said. "I don't know what happened.
but you almost got yourself killed.

1132
01:11:51,304 --> 01:11:54,296
You were carrying a firearm.
and I don't know what you were thinking.

1133
01:11:54,407 --> 01:11:58,138
But listen. We ran tests.
We checked your blood. Son.

1134
01:11:58,244 --> 01:12:01,645
And we can't find
anything in your blood."

1135
01:12:01,747 --> 01:12:06,150
For a second I was sober...
"What the dope man done sold me?"

1136
01:12:08,020 --> 01:12:10,921
You know. When they can't
find it in your blood?

1137
01:12:12,158 --> 01:12:14,888
So he said. "I wanna help you
get the fuck home.

1138
01:12:14,994 --> 01:12:18,430
I wanna get you out of here
and back to your family.

1139
01:12:18,531 --> 01:12:22,729
But you're gonna have to help me
to help you. That's what you can do.

1140
01:12:22,835 --> 01:12:25,702
I need to know
what you were smoking...

1141
01:12:25,805 --> 01:12:27,773
and who sold it to you."

1142
01:12:29,075 --> 01:12:31,908
I sobered up
for about 30 seconds.

1143
01:12:32,011 --> 01:12:34,878
"I can't tell you that. Doc.

1144
01:12:34,980 --> 01:12:38,279
That's a street code. We never tell.
What the fuck you talking about?"

1145
01:12:40,319 --> 01:12:41,980
That's what I told him.

1146
01:12:42,088 --> 01:12:44,352
"You trying to get me fucked up
by the dope man?"

1147
01:12:45,991 --> 01:12:48,926
Then it was time for me to go.
'cause I was together.

1148
01:12:49,028 --> 01:12:50,928
The ooh-wee had got
out of my system.

1149
01:12:51,030 --> 01:12:54,227
I couldn't believe I was
out on the street lunchin'.

1150
01:12:54,333 --> 01:12:57,996
I had the hottest show on. I couldn't
believe these things was happening.

1151
01:12:58,104 --> 01:13:00,698
Marriage was on the brink.
All kind of shit after that.

1152
01:13:00,806 --> 01:13:03,832
But before I left the hospital...

1153
01:13:03,943 --> 01:13:07,879
I got your love. And I felt
your love and support for me.

1154
01:13:07,980 --> 01:13:09,379
You know?

1155
01:13:12,418 --> 01:13:15,512
And it was a beautiful thing.
and I thank each and every one of you.

1156
01:13:15,621 --> 01:13:17,589
That meant a lot to me.

1157
01:13:17,690 --> 01:13:20,853
It truly meant a lot to me.
so I'm forever grateful.

1158
01:13:20,960 --> 01:13:23,394
And I tell you...

1159
01:13:23,496 --> 01:13:26,397
celebrities came up to see me
when I was in the hospital.

1160
01:13:26,499 --> 01:13:28,660
It was kinda wild.
They came to see me.

1161
01:13:28,768 --> 01:13:32,431
Magic Johnson came to see me
when I was in the hospital.

1162
01:13:32,538 --> 01:13:35,701
When I was going through one of
my hardest times. He came and said...

1163
01:13:35,808 --> 01:13:37,901
"Martin. What are you doin'. Boy?

1164
01:13:39,178 --> 01:13:44,411
What are you doing out on the street.
doing that crazy stuff like that. Man?

1165
01:13:44,517 --> 01:13:48,283
You gotta take care of yourself.
You got a hot show. Don't blow it. Man.

1166
01:13:48,387 --> 01:13:51,550
You got to be like 'Show time!"'

1167
01:13:52,658 --> 01:13:56,025
That was a beautiful thing
for Magic to give me that advice.

1168
01:13:56,128 --> 01:13:59,620
So since I had him there.
I took the opportunity to ask him...

1169
01:13:59,732 --> 01:14:01,632
to get me on the Lakers.

1170
01:14:03,135 --> 01:14:06,832
And he said. "Sure. Mar.
I'll see what I can do. Mar."

1171
01:14:06,939 --> 01:14:10,841
I know he went home and told Cookie.
"Yeah. That motherfucker in bad shape.

1172
01:14:12,077 --> 01:14:15,308
He wanted to take Derek Fisher's job.
I don't know what the fuck he's thinking."

1173
01:14:16,982 --> 01:14:20,008
So finally I got out
of the hospital.

1174
01:14:20,119 --> 01:14:23,282
That was one thing I went through.
I couldn't believe it. Fucked up.

1175
01:14:23,389 --> 01:14:26,256
I said. "Now I got the embarrassment
hanging over me."

1176
01:14:26,358 --> 01:14:29,225
I never really wanted
to go down that way.

1177
01:14:30,029 --> 01:14:32,623
But I had to move on. So...

1178
01:14:32,731 --> 01:14:34,631
I'm trying to get it together.

1179
01:14:34,733 --> 01:14:38,669
Couldn't really go home. 'cause it
wasn't really going so well at home.

1180
01:14:38,771 --> 01:14:41,672
So I did what we all do when we're
trying to get our life together...

1181
01:14:41,774 --> 01:14:43,674
I went to a club.

1182
01:14:45,978 --> 01:14:48,845
I'm out that motherfucker. Man...

1183
01:14:48,948 --> 01:14:51,917
I'm at the club dancing. Minding my
business. Doing the ladies dance.

1184
01:14:52,017 --> 01:14:55,748
I'm a little off. Though.
I ain't on the right dances yet.

1185
01:14:55,855 --> 01:14:57,755
I'm still on some old shit.

1186
01:14:57,857 --> 01:15:00,519
And some. You know... I don't know
what this motherfucker was.

1187
01:15:00,626 --> 01:15:04,187
He bumped into me. And I said.
"Watch yourself. Partner."

1188
01:15:04,296 --> 01:15:06,196
Then he go and push me.

1189
01:15:06,298 --> 01:15:08,357
I punched that boy in his mouth.

1190
01:15:08,467 --> 01:15:10,799
We rumblin' in there.

1191
01:15:10,903 --> 01:15:12,495
Then everybody clears out.

1192
01:15:12,605 --> 01:15:15,540
I'm rumblin'. Everybody clears out.
Even he cleared out.

1193
01:15:15,641 --> 01:15:18,542
I said. "Damn. I know I can rumble.
but hot damn!

1194
01:15:18,644 --> 01:15:21,204
Shouldn't have started it
if you wasn't gonna finish."

1195
01:15:21,313 --> 01:15:24,214
So he runs out. And then
all these damn cops come in...

1196
01:15:24,316 --> 01:15:27,217
about 30 fucking cops
with shotguns and shit...

1197
01:15:27,319 --> 01:15:29,219
all for little-ass Martin.

1198
01:15:30,756 --> 01:15:33,657
Thirty cops.
You'd have thought I was bin Laden.

1199
01:15:35,361 --> 01:15:39,525
They came in that motherfucker...
"Mr. Lawrence!"

1200
01:15:39,632 --> 01:15:40,894
I fainted again.

1201
01:15:42,668 --> 01:15:45,296
How come I feel like
somebody's watching me?

1202
01:15:45,404 --> 01:15:49,135
Next thing you know. They put me in
jail. This time I didn't get off easy.

1203
01:15:49,241 --> 01:15:50,708
They said. "Fuck it.

1204
01:15:50,809 --> 01:15:54,074
On Ventura we didn't take you to jail.
but now we're taking your ass to jail."

1205
01:15:54,179 --> 01:15:56,704
When I woke up.
they had me ready to go.

1206
01:15:56,815 --> 01:16:00,842
I knew I was getting ready to go fuck
around with them hardheads up in there.

1207
01:16:00,953 --> 01:16:03,251
I wasn't trying to get them
to come at me right here...

1208
01:16:03,355 --> 01:16:05,255
so I jumped down
and did some pushups.

1209
01:16:05,357 --> 01:16:08,258
I said. "Wait. Officer.
let me do a few of these."

1210
01:16:08,360 --> 01:16:10,920
And I got real "deezed" on 'em.

1211
01:16:11,030 --> 01:16:13,260
My arms was hawked up
a little bit...

1212
01:16:13,365 --> 01:16:15,765
so I could go up in that motherfucker
and bang with these niggers.

1213
01:16:15,868 --> 01:16:18,336
"What? What. Nigger. What?"

1214
01:16:18,437 --> 01:16:22,840
So they take me to the precinct
and throw me in the cell by myself.

1215
01:16:24,209 --> 01:16:27,110
So I'm sittin' in that motherfucker
with the arms all swolled...

1216
01:16:27,212 --> 01:16:29,112
chest all "deezed."

1217
01:16:30,215 --> 01:16:32,615
Nobody to rumble
out that motherfucker.

1218
01:16:34,153 --> 01:16:38,556
They said. "The best way to get back
at Martin... let him stay by hisself."

1219
01:16:38,657 --> 01:16:42,616
The next thing you know. An hour go by.
my "deez" drops a little bit.

1220
01:16:44,363 --> 01:16:47,264
Another hour go by.
and they drop a little more.

1221
01:16:47,366 --> 01:16:51,200
About four hours go by.
I'm holding my arms. Going. "Oh. Bitch.

1222
01:16:51,971 --> 01:16:53,871
I'm sorry!

1223
01:16:55,140 --> 01:16:58,200
He hit me first!

1224
01:16:58,310 --> 01:17:00,210
I'm not an animal!

1225
01:17:00,312 --> 01:17:02,872
I'm not an animal."

1226
01:17:02,982 --> 01:17:05,883
Finally they let me
up out the motherfucker.

1227
01:17:05,985 --> 01:17:10,285
I'm getting ready to get outta there.
thinking I'm going home and shit...

1228
01:17:10,389 --> 01:17:12,289
and they hand me a paper
to go to court.

1229
01:17:12,391 --> 01:17:14,120
I go to court.

1230
01:17:14,226 --> 01:17:17,389
The judge I had was this. You know...
he was a cool. Young white dude.

1231
01:17:17,496 --> 01:17:21,694
Didn't take no shit. But straight
to the point. Tell you how it is.

1232
01:17:21,800 --> 01:17:24,928
He said. "Martin. What the fuck
are you doing in my courtroom?

1233
01:17:25,037 --> 01:17:27,938
I wanna know why the fuck
are you in my courtroom.

1234
01:17:28,040 --> 01:17:29,632
I don't understand that.

1235
01:17:29,742 --> 01:17:34,736
Whoa. Whoa. You mean I go to have
my bagel and coffee this morning...

1236
01:17:34,847 --> 01:17:38,112
I look at the paperwork. And your
fucking name is on my fucking desk?

1237
01:17:38,217 --> 01:17:40,981
What are you thinking?
You know what you're doing?

1238
01:17:41,086 --> 01:17:44,351
You're making an ass out of yourself
and you're blowing it. Kid.

1239
01:17:44,456 --> 01:17:45,855
You're blowing it.

1240
01:17:45,958 --> 01:17:48,859
You're in a position to do
what a lot of people would love to do...

1241
01:17:48,961 --> 01:17:50,360
and you're throwing it away.

1242
01:17:50,462 --> 01:17:53,397
You're becoming a menace to society.
and it doesn't even make sense.

1243
01:17:53,499 --> 01:17:58,698
Why don't you use all this exposure and
shit to do something positive. Martin?

1244
01:17:58,804 --> 01:18:01,637
'Cause you're in my courtroom.
I will lock your fucking ass up.

1245
01:18:01,740 --> 01:18:04,140
I don't give a shit.
I will lock you up.

1246
01:18:04,243 --> 01:18:08,339
Yes. I'm down with the brothers and
the homies. I will lock your ass up.

1247
01:18:08,447 --> 01:18:09,846
Okay?

1248
01:18:09,948 --> 01:18:12,849
I put someone away about a year ago.
His name was Tank.

1249
01:18:12,951 --> 01:18:16,216
He thought he was bad.
Now his name is Tina.

1250
01:18:16,321 --> 01:18:18,881
And Tina's wearing
little tankies. Martin.

1251
01:18:18,991 --> 01:18:22,950
You need to get your shit together
or leave it alone. I'll lock your ass up.

1252
01:18:23,062 --> 01:18:24,962
Okay? Ask Gary Coleman."

1253
01:18:28,834 --> 01:18:30,893
I said. "Oh. Shit!

1254
01:18:31,003 --> 01:18:33,995
You're right.
I'll get it together. You're right.

1255
01:18:34,106 --> 01:18:35,869
I'll get it together."

1256
01:18:35,974 --> 01:18:38,204
And he said.
"Not without probation."

1257
01:18:41,113 --> 01:18:43,013
And I said.
"Never again. Never again."

1258
01:18:43,115 --> 01:18:46,676
I said. "Martin..."
I asked myself. I said...

1259
01:18:46,785 --> 01:18:50,881
"How did you go through all that?
How... That's stupid.

1260
01:18:50,989 --> 01:18:54,288
What you have gotten to do
in your lifetime...

1261
01:18:54,393 --> 01:18:56,827
a lot of people would love to do.

1262
01:18:56,929 --> 01:19:00,763
Fortunately. God has blessed you
with a gift to make people laugh...

1263
01:19:06,538 --> 01:19:08,938
and to do some very
special things in life.

1264
01:19:09,808 --> 01:19:12,072
And you come that far
to throw it away?"

1265
01:19:12,177 --> 01:19:14,077
Then it hit me.
I said. "Nah."

1266
01:19:14,179 --> 01:19:18,548
I didn't want to keep jumping on myself
and keep feeling down about myself.

1267
01:19:18,650 --> 01:19:21,244
I said. "Nah."
But then it hit me. You know what?

1268
01:19:21,353 --> 01:19:23,583
I said. "I'm only human."

1269
01:19:23,689 --> 01:19:27,250
If I'm crucified for being a human.
then so be it.

1270
01:19:27,359 --> 01:19:31,455
Because no one is immune
to the trials and tribulations of life.

1271
01:19:31,563 --> 01:19:33,463
No one.

1272
01:19:33,565 --> 01:19:37,661
No matter what you do.
you are not immune...

1273
01:19:37,770 --> 01:19:39,670
to the trials
and tribulations of life.

1274
01:19:41,373 --> 01:19:43,273
As I got out...

1275
01:19:43,375 --> 01:19:45,434
and tried to get myself together...

1276
01:19:45,544 --> 01:19:48,843
I stopped fuckin' with the ooh-wee
'cause it wasn't for me.

1277
01:19:50,048 --> 01:19:51,447
That's a start.

1278
01:19:51,550 --> 01:19:54,451
So I got it together.
I kept movin'.

1279
01:19:54,553 --> 01:19:57,613
I said. "Let me get my life together."
and as I'm getting my life together...

1280
01:19:57,723 --> 01:20:00,123
I'm dealing with the motherfuckers
writing bullshit about me...

1281
01:20:00,225 --> 01:20:02,125
saying negative things about me.

1282
01:20:02,227 --> 01:20:07,324
All these devils that
just wanna take God's child out.

1283
01:20:07,432 --> 01:20:09,332
Here goes all these rumors.

1284
01:20:09,434 --> 01:20:11,629
Here goes all these rumors
writin' about me.

1285
01:20:11,737 --> 01:20:14,900
I see on the paper.
one of'em says...

1286
01:20:15,007 --> 01:20:19,444
"Martin tries to jump
out of a plane...

1287
01:20:19,545 --> 01:20:22,036
using his jacket
as a parachute."

1288
01:20:25,651 --> 01:20:28,984
As I'm trying to get my life together.
they're gonna write that bullshit.

1289
01:20:29,087 --> 01:20:31,988
I know damn well
you can't jump out no plane...

1290
01:20:32,090 --> 01:20:34,490
using your jacket
as a parachute.

1291
01:20:34,593 --> 01:20:37,585
Shit. I know
you got to use your pants.

1292
01:20:37,696 --> 01:20:39,823
They don't think
I know this shit.

1293
01:20:39,932 --> 01:20:41,832
So I said. "Fuck that."

1294
01:20:41,934 --> 01:20:43,335
Then I was trying to get my dating
scene on. Find a lady in my life.

1295
01:20:43,335 --> 01:20:46,304
Then I was trying to get my dating
scene on. Find a lady in my life.

1296
01:20:46,405 --> 01:20:49,033
'Cause I wasn't married no more.
so I'm running around. You know...

1297
01:20:49,141 --> 01:20:53,043
"What's up. Miss lady? How you doin'?"
And they was believing that shit.

1298
01:20:53,145 --> 01:20:56,342
I'd say. "Hello."
They'd say. "Ah. You crazy. Ain't you?"

1299
01:20:56,448 --> 01:20:58,575
Girl. Don't fuck with him.
He crazy.

1300
01:20:58,684 --> 01:21:01,710
That motherfucker probably got a Glock
on him. Don't fuck with him."

1301
01:21:02,487 --> 01:21:06,150
I couldn't believe it.
So then I said. "Fuck the rumors.

1302
01:21:06,258 --> 01:21:09,386
Fuck what they say. Fuck what they
write. 'cause I'm gonna be all right."

1303
01:21:09,494 --> 01:21:11,894
And that's what I did.
I went running.

1304
01:21:13,298 --> 01:21:15,198
I went jogging.

1305
01:21:15,300 --> 01:21:16,699
I went running.

1306
01:21:16,802 --> 01:21:19,100
I was trying to
get my mind together.

1307
01:21:19,204 --> 01:21:22,435
I'm out there. I'm running.
and I'm jogging...

1308
01:21:22,541 --> 01:21:25,635
and I'm thinking. "Somewhere
there's got to be a love for me."

1309
01:21:26,745 --> 01:21:29,646
I'm doing my jogging.
listening to the headphones...

1310
01:21:29,748 --> 01:21:31,648
but I happen to go jogging...

1311
01:21:31,750 --> 01:21:33,650
on the fuckin' hottest day...

1312
01:21:33,752 --> 01:21:35,913
of the fuckin' summer!

1313
01:21:37,823 --> 01:21:39,586
And a nigger pass out!

1314
01:21:40,692 --> 01:21:42,091
Damn!

1315
01:21:42,194 --> 01:21:44,924
I passed the fuck out.

1316
01:21:45,030 --> 01:21:47,328
Lyin' in shit on the lawn.

1317
01:21:48,433 --> 01:21:52,529
Can't believe that. As if I didn't have
enough shit going on in my life.

1318
01:21:52,638 --> 01:21:57,541
Now I'm back on the motherfucking scene
passed out by shit on a lawn.

1319
01:22:00,545 --> 01:22:03,537
Neighbors walking by.
seeing me laying there.

1320
01:22:03,649 --> 01:22:05,810
My white neighbors
didn't wanna bother me.

1321
01:22:05,918 --> 01:22:08,785
"Isn't that Martin
laying on his lawn?

1322
01:22:08,887 --> 01:22:11,082
Why doesn't he
go in the house?"

1323
01:22:11,189 --> 01:22:14,522
"I don't know. But that's that
nigger's house. Let him lay there."

1324
01:22:15,928 --> 01:22:19,364
But my lady found me.
She called the ambulance.

1325
01:22:19,464 --> 01:22:23,059
And I'm forever grateful
to her. My family. All of them.

1326
01:22:23,168 --> 01:22:27,195
They was instrumental
in being a part of saving my life.

1327
01:22:27,306 --> 01:22:29,604
But they didn't think
I was here. Y'all...

1328
01:22:29,708 --> 01:22:33,508
'cause I was laying on the ground.
and that sun was frying my head...

1329
01:22:33,612 --> 01:22:36,775
in a skull cap.
in a fuckin' wool-ass hat.

1330
01:22:38,450 --> 01:22:40,350
It was fryin' my shit.

1331
01:22:41,553 --> 01:22:45,250
So they think. "Oh. Man!" They checked
my pulse. They couldn't find no pulse.

1332
01:22:45,357 --> 01:22:47,621
My temperature was 10 7.

1333
01:22:47,726 --> 01:22:51,127
So the ambulance drivers leaned over.
couldn't feel the pulse.

1334
01:22:51,229 --> 01:22:53,697
They said. "Fuck it.
This nigger gone.

1335
01:22:53,799 --> 01:22:56,290
You wanna stop
at the liquor store?"

1336
01:22:56,401 --> 01:22:59,165
"Yeah. Pick up some Courvoisier.
Fuck that."

1337
01:22:59,271 --> 01:23:01,739
But they get me
to the hospital on time.

1338
01:23:01,840 --> 01:23:05,970
I'm thankful to all of them...
the doctors and nurses. The ambulance.

1339
01:23:06,078 --> 01:23:08,979
But one thing they gonna do... I'm 10 7.
They needed to put me on ice.

1340
01:23:09,081 --> 01:23:13,518
They put me on nothing but ice.
They put ice all over my body.

1341
01:23:13,618 --> 01:23:15,176
Butt naked.

1342
01:23:15,287 --> 01:23:17,118
Damn it!

1343
01:23:17,222 --> 01:23:19,213
Now. I don't mind that.

1344
01:23:19,324 --> 01:23:21,224
I'm hot? Cool me off.

1345
01:23:21,326 --> 01:23:25,228
But I was butt-naked. And I didn't have
the weight in my meat I usually have.

1346
01:23:26,465 --> 01:23:28,660
So I'm out there like this on ice.

1347
01:23:29,768 --> 01:23:32,896
And they around me
taking pictures and shit...

1348
01:23:33,005 --> 01:23:34,836
laughing at me!

1349
01:23:34,940 --> 01:23:38,239
I'm gonna fight that in court.
I'm gonna deal with that.

1350
01:23:38,343 --> 01:23:40,743
'Cause somebody could've put
an ice cube under my balls...

1351
01:23:40,846 --> 01:23:42,905
and swolled it up a little
or something.

1352
01:23:43,015 --> 01:23:45,916
Come on. Now.
I'm a black man. Y'all.

1353
01:23:46,018 --> 01:23:47,918
But they didn't do that.

1354
01:23:49,921 --> 01:23:51,684
My family was there.

1355
01:23:51,790 --> 01:23:55,487
The doctors tried to tell them
to go home. They said. You know...

1356
01:23:55,594 --> 01:23:58,722
And I love them and thank them so much
for never giving up on me...

1357
01:23:58,830 --> 01:24:02,823
because. Had they gone home. I probably
wouldn't even be here. You know.

1358
01:24:02,934 --> 01:24:04,231
My brother...

1359
01:24:04,336 --> 01:24:07,737
Yeah. Thank you.
I applaud 'em. All of'em.

1360
01:24:07,839 --> 01:24:09,739
My whole family.
I love 'em.

1361
01:24:13,178 --> 01:24:15,305
Yeah. It was rough.

1362
01:24:15,414 --> 01:24:19,544
My brother scared the doctor. 'cause he
didn't wanna hear that. He's military.

1363
01:24:19,651 --> 01:24:22,347
"What the fuck
you talking about? What?

1364
01:24:22,454 --> 01:24:24,979
Nigger. I'm gonna
walk down the street.

1365
01:24:25,090 --> 01:24:28,548
When I get back. Keep talking
that shit you talking. Doc.

1366
01:24:29,461 --> 01:24:32,487
Better pull out a stethoscope.
motherfucker. Or something."

1367
01:24:32,597 --> 01:24:36,897
That's when they started working on me.
Them doctors did all they could.

1368
01:24:37,002 --> 01:24:38,401
And I thank them for that.

1369
01:24:38,503 --> 01:24:42,064
But as much as I thanked them.
I gave God the glory...

1370
01:24:42,174 --> 01:24:43,971
for bringing me back.

1371
01:24:45,710 --> 01:24:48,474
I give him the glory.
No question.

1372
01:24:48,580 --> 01:24:50,571
I thank him. You know...

1373
01:24:50,682 --> 01:24:54,277
for putting his children
out there around me to help me.

1374
01:24:54,386 --> 01:24:57,014
So I woke up three days later.

1375
01:24:57,122 --> 01:25:00,523
Being out for three days
was some of the best sleep I ever got.

1376
01:25:00,625 --> 01:25:04,288
I woke up. Everybody was happy
to see me..."We love you! We love you!"

1377
01:25:04,396 --> 01:25:07,331
"Ain't nothin' wrong
with my hearing."

1378
01:25:07,432 --> 01:25:10,663
I had a tube in my mouth.
I had a catheter in my dick.

1379
01:25:11,770 --> 01:25:13,670
I thought my dick had grew.

1380
01:25:15,107 --> 01:25:17,507
Shit.
It was a damn catheter.

1381
01:25:17,609 --> 01:25:19,600
I didn't know how they
got that catheter in there.

1382
01:25:19,711 --> 01:25:22,612
They couldn't have got that shit in there
if I was woke. I'll tell you that.

1383
01:25:23,715 --> 01:25:26,275
So I had to learn
to talk again.

1384
01:25:26,384 --> 01:25:28,511
I had to learn to walk again.

1385
01:25:28,620 --> 01:25:32,351
I had to learn to do all these things
we generally take for granted.

1386
01:25:32,457 --> 01:25:35,358
It come not so easy.
I had to learn to do that shit again.

1387
01:25:35,460 --> 01:25:37,951
My show was running on the air.
I got movies out...

1388
01:25:38,063 --> 01:25:41,089
but I can't go to premieres and shit
because I can't walk.

1389
01:25:41,199 --> 01:25:43,292
Can't do all this shit.

1390
01:25:43,401 --> 01:25:47,861
So I said. "Fuck it.
I gotta work hard to get better."

1391
01:25:47,973 --> 01:25:50,100
So they put me in a room
and gave me a bell.

1392
01:25:50,208 --> 01:25:54,872
They said. "If you need help. Hit this
bell and we'll come in and help you.

1393
01:25:54,980 --> 01:25:57,210
The nurse will come help you."

1394
01:25:57,315 --> 01:26:00,148
This catheter was attached
to a tank that had...

1395
01:26:00,252 --> 01:26:02,152
It's where your piss goes.

1396
01:26:03,255 --> 01:26:06,156
One day I tried to get up
and forgot I couldn't walk...

1397
01:26:06,258 --> 01:26:08,385
and the whole piss tank fell.

1398
01:26:08,493 --> 01:26:09,551
I ring the bell.

1399
01:26:12,797 --> 01:26:14,856
"I dropped my piss!"

1400
01:26:18,637 --> 01:26:21,800
So the nurse came in.
and the nurse was fine.

1401
01:26:21,907 --> 01:26:24,740
She was so fine.
you'd go. "Goddamn!"

1402
01:26:25,844 --> 01:26:27,311
She cleaned up the piss.

1403
01:26:27,412 --> 01:26:30,313
This fine. Professional woman
started cleaning up the piss.

1404
01:26:30,415 --> 01:26:34,215
She talked to me and said. "Don't be
embarrassed. This is gonna happen.

1405
01:26:34,319 --> 01:26:39,018
But if you think you have to go to
the bathroom or want to try to get up...

1406
01:26:39,124 --> 01:26:41,024
ring your bell and I'll help you.

1407
01:26:41,126 --> 01:26:43,492
But don't try to get up.
all right?"

1408
01:26:43,595 --> 01:26:45,222
I said. "Thank you."

1409
01:26:45,330 --> 01:26:47,230
But I forgot.

1410
01:26:47,332 --> 01:26:48,890
Tried it. Piss everywhere.

1411
01:26:49,701 --> 01:26:51,692
"I dropped my piss."

1412
01:26:53,138 --> 01:26:56,266
"Mr. Lawrence. Don't try to get up.
Just ring your bell.

1413
01:26:56,374 --> 01:26:58,365
That's what I'm here for."

1414
01:26:58,476 --> 01:27:02,674
Then one day I was looking at
something on TV. And I laughed.

1415
01:27:03,782 --> 01:27:06,751
And I shitted on myself.

1416
01:27:07,719 --> 01:27:09,516
It was that borderline...

1417
01:27:09,621 --> 01:27:12,181
It was just really
all soft shit...

1418
01:27:12,290 --> 01:27:15,259
because I only had
liquids in me.

1419
01:27:15,360 --> 01:27:18,329
It just smeared
all around my fuckin' thigh...

1420
01:27:18,430 --> 01:27:21,524
and it was stinkin'
like a motherfucker.

1421
01:27:23,735 --> 01:27:28,172
I was gonna ring the bell. And I said.
"I can't call that fine motherfucker.

1422
01:27:28,273 --> 01:27:32,107
I can't tell that fine motherfucker
that I done shitted on myself.

1423
01:27:33,278 --> 01:27:36,304
I can't tell her.
I know she got a fine friend...

1424
01:27:36,414 --> 01:27:37,813
that know a fine friend.

1425
01:27:37,916 --> 01:27:40,817
All the fine ones
gonna know I shitted."

1426
01:27:42,954 --> 01:27:45,855
I couldn't do it. I'm holding my nose.
I couldn't take it no more.

1427
01:27:45,957 --> 01:27:48,357
It was cuttin' through
my passages.

1428
01:27:55,700 --> 01:27:58,260
"I shitted on myself."

1429
01:27:59,604 --> 01:28:01,834
And this fine woman...

1430
01:28:01,940 --> 01:28:03,430
came in...

1431
01:28:04,542 --> 01:28:07,170
and cleaned up the shit.

1432
01:28:07,279 --> 01:28:09,179
She was so patient with me.

1433
01:28:09,281 --> 01:28:13,718
"Mr. Lawrence. I know you're a little
embarrassed. But these things happen.

1434
01:28:13,818 --> 01:28:18,050
Now. I told you. Your bowels...
your muscles are not strong.

1435
01:28:18,156 --> 01:28:20,056
So don't worry about it.

1436
01:28:20,158 --> 01:28:23,321
There's no need to be embarrassed.
These things happen.

1437
01:28:23,428 --> 01:28:25,828
This is the hospital.
Don't worry about it."

1438
01:28:25,930 --> 01:28:28,455
And then she started
cleaning me.

1439
01:28:30,068 --> 01:28:32,502
And she cleaned. And she wiped.

1440
01:28:33,605 --> 01:28:36,005
I looked at her.

1441
01:28:36,107 --> 01:28:39,008
This woman was cleaning doo-doo...

1442
01:28:40,645 --> 01:28:42,203
off me.

1443
01:28:43,882 --> 01:28:45,281
And I said...

1444
01:28:47,719 --> 01:28:50,119
I started falling in love.

1445
01:29:06,271 --> 01:29:07,966
Now. Man...

1446
01:29:08,073 --> 01:29:12,100
that was a beautiful thing
for them to do... for her to do.

1447
01:29:12,210 --> 01:29:16,510
After that. I shitted maybe
seven more times. I would say.

1448
01:29:16,614 --> 01:29:19,845
Went from hard shit to doodle balls.
all kinds of shit.

1449
01:29:19,951 --> 01:29:21,942
Shit with corn in it.

1450
01:29:22,053 --> 01:29:23,543
And she cleaned it up.

1451
01:29:23,655 --> 01:29:26,783
About the tenth doo-doo.
she was madder than a motherfucker.

1452
01:29:26,891 --> 01:29:29,359
All that professional
went out the window.

1453
01:29:29,461 --> 01:29:31,361
"All right. Mr. Lawrence!

1454
01:29:31,463 --> 01:29:33,954
Now. This shit
don't make no sense!

1455
01:29:34,065 --> 01:29:36,329
You too grown for this shit!

1456
01:29:36,434 --> 01:29:40,336
You been in this hospital all this time. And
you ain't worked your fuckin' muscles yet?

1457
01:29:40,438 --> 01:29:43,271
Shittin' all over the place.
That's just not cute.

1458
01:29:43,375 --> 01:29:47,277
And you gonna act like you wanna get
with me. I don't want no shitty man.

1459
01:29:48,847 --> 01:29:52,374
Talkin' about 'Martin! Martin! '
Should be Shitty Martin."

1460
01:29:55,086 --> 01:29:58,317
Scared me so bad.
I just stopped shittin' for a while.

1461
01:29:59,524 --> 01:30:00,752
Didn't do nothin'.

1462
01:30:00,859 --> 01:30:04,386
I think she quit after that. They said
she was gone. Couldn't find her nowhere.

1463
01:30:04,496 --> 01:30:07,897
Said she couldn't take the shit
off Martin no more. She was tired of it.

1464
01:30:09,000 --> 01:30:11,992
I think I shitted one more time.
and I just sat in that.

1465
01:30:12,103 --> 01:30:14,003
"I will not tell nobody."

1466
01:30:14,105 --> 01:30:16,505
And the whole room was funky.

1467
01:30:16,608 --> 01:30:20,908
It was so stinky. "Fuck it.
My pride won't let me tell nobody.

1468
01:30:21,012 --> 01:30:23,344
'Cause I don't want them
to get angry with me no more."

1469
01:30:23,448 --> 01:30:27,145
I tied a pillowcase around my head
and around my nose...

1470
01:30:27,252 --> 01:30:28,742
and cut out the eyes.

1471
01:30:28,853 --> 01:30:32,254
I was in there looking like
a shitty superhero.

1472
01:30:41,466 --> 01:30:45,266
And then they motherfuckin'
came in the room and shit.

1473
01:30:45,370 --> 01:30:48,271
You know. They could smell.
'cause it was messing up the hospital.

1474
01:30:48,373 --> 01:30:50,466
They thought they was gonna
have to quarantine the hospital.

1475
01:30:50,575 --> 01:30:53,908
They found it was me sittin' in shit.
and I started blaming people.

1476
01:30:54,012 --> 01:30:55,411
I was in denial.

1477
01:30:56,848 --> 01:30:59,715
"There's a serial shitter
going around.

1478
01:30:59,818 --> 01:31:02,446
He broke in
and put the drawers on me.

1479
01:31:02,554 --> 01:31:04,647
He went that-a-way."

1480
01:31:07,492 --> 01:31:09,483
But one thing I can say...

1481
01:31:09,594 --> 01:31:12,495
honestly. Truly from the heart
that I learned...

1482
01:31:12,597 --> 01:31:15,862
from. You know. Ventura...

1483
01:31:15,967 --> 01:31:20,063
the gun. Assault. Whatever...
fights and coma and all that.

1484
01:31:20,171 --> 01:31:22,366
One thing I truly learned...

1485
01:31:22,474 --> 01:31:25,068
is that we fall down...

1486
01:31:25,176 --> 01:31:26,803
but we get up.

1487
01:31:27,979 --> 01:31:29,241
Thank you.

1488
01:31:33,985 --> 01:31:36,385
Will all the people
who like sex...

1489
01:31:38,957 --> 01:31:41,357
All the people
who like safe sex.

1490
01:31:43,294 --> 01:31:46,058
Sex is good.
I love sex.

1491
01:31:46,164 --> 01:31:48,689
That's a good thing. Isn't it?
I love sex.

1492
01:31:49,834 --> 01:31:51,734
I love everything about it.

1493
01:31:51,836 --> 01:31:53,736
Just not all the crazy stuff.

1494
01:31:53,838 --> 01:31:56,238
Ladies. I love that oral sex.

1495
01:31:57,342 --> 01:32:00,243
I love when you do me.
I really do. I really do.

1496
01:32:01,913 --> 01:32:03,972
You gotta soak. You know.

1497
01:32:04,082 --> 01:32:06,983
If I'm gonna do that.
you gotta clean it well.

1498
01:32:07,085 --> 01:32:10,418
Because. Guys. If you ever caught
a bad one. That shit will scar you...

1499
01:32:10,522 --> 01:32:13,013
for the rest
of your fucking life.

1500
01:32:13,124 --> 01:32:15,524
You ever go down
and it smell like...

1501
01:32:17,595 --> 01:32:19,529
you will be fucked up.

1502
01:32:21,466 --> 01:32:24,026
Shit smell like. "Oh. No."

1503
01:32:24,135 --> 01:32:27,366
So if you clean it right.
we don't have to go through that.

1504
01:32:27,472 --> 01:32:31,067
'Cause. Ladies. You don't like a man
with a stinky dick. Am I correct?

1505
01:32:31,175 --> 01:32:33,837
You would let a man know
in a minute.

1506
01:32:33,945 --> 01:32:36,243
"Your balls stink.

1507
01:32:36,347 --> 01:32:38,907
Your balls stink!"

1508
01:32:39,017 --> 01:32:42,316
I got a woman right now
suing me.

1509
01:32:42,420 --> 01:32:44,388
No. Not 'cause of stinky dick.

1510
01:32:45,490 --> 01:32:48,755
She gonna say I gave her
high blood pressure...

1511
01:32:48,860 --> 01:32:51,260
'cause I had salt on my balls.

1512
01:33:01,539 --> 01:33:04,940
I said. "I thought you liked your meat
seasoned. Baby. What's the problem?"

1513
01:33:06,210 --> 01:33:08,770
But sex is good.
Sex is good.

1514
01:33:08,880 --> 01:33:11,007
Do it when you get the chance
to do it. Have fun.

1515
01:33:11,115 --> 01:33:13,276
Make love. Let it blossom.
but do it right.

1516
01:33:13,384 --> 01:33:17,252
That weird sex shit? Who is out here
doing that weird sex shit?

1517
01:33:17,355 --> 01:33:18,982
Who's doing that?

1518
01:33:19,090 --> 01:33:21,183
Stop that shit.
You know who you are.

1519
01:33:21,292 --> 01:33:22,691
Pissing on people?

1520
01:33:23,995 --> 01:33:26,395
That is not lovemaking.
Stop getting that...

1521
01:33:27,999 --> 01:33:29,432
"You like that?

1522
01:33:29,534 --> 01:33:32,992
Let me drink two more cups of water.
and I got a little more for you."

1523
01:33:34,772 --> 01:33:36,467
Cut it out!

1524
01:33:36,574 --> 01:33:38,769
Cut out doing
that weird sex shit.

1525
01:33:38,876 --> 01:33:42,073
And whoever is doing
that S&M. Stop it.

1526
01:33:42,180 --> 01:33:45,775
Listen. If you wanna do a little
something. You just gotta be gentle.

1527
01:33:45,883 --> 01:33:48,317
Is it called S&M... S&M?

1528
01:33:48,419 --> 01:33:50,512
I don't do it.
so I don't know.

1529
01:33:50,622 --> 01:33:53,614
Listen. Ain't nothin' wrong
with a little pop on the ass.

1530
01:33:53,725 --> 01:33:56,785
I'm a pop-on-the-ass man.
I know how to do it though.

1531
01:33:56,894 --> 01:33:59,124
I been trained for that
and everything.

1532
01:34:00,365 --> 01:34:02,356
They show you how
you're supposed to do that.

1533
01:34:02,467 --> 01:34:05,265
One leg here.
the other leg here.

1534
01:34:05,370 --> 01:34:08,737
When you pop.
you come up off it like that.

1535
01:34:09,507 --> 01:34:12,067
See? That means you're not
actually trying to hurt 'em.

1536
01:34:12,176 --> 01:34:15,509
You're just trying to make them
feel that sting.

1537
01:34:15,613 --> 01:34:18,514
But when you pop
and plow 'em into the fucking wall...

1538
01:34:19,884 --> 01:34:21,784
then it's starting to get brutal.

1539
01:34:21,886 --> 01:34:23,820
You don't want that.
That's brutal sex.

1540
01:34:23,921 --> 01:34:26,412
You don't wanna
pull your dick out...

1541
01:34:26,524 --> 01:34:30,085
and then drop your foot
on the back of their neck.

1542
01:34:30,194 --> 01:34:33,925
You don't wanna take hot curlers
and burn their stomach.

1543
01:34:34,032 --> 01:34:36,262
Talkin' about.
"You love me? You love me?"

1544
01:34:36,367 --> 01:34:39,268
That's just not
what you wanna do.

1545
01:34:41,439 --> 01:34:45,637
I seen some white boy tell his lady.
"Kick me in my balls real hard.

1546
01:34:45,743 --> 01:34:47,540
Right now."

1547
01:34:49,113 --> 01:34:51,513
"Fuck. Yeah! Yeah!"

1548
01:34:53,618 --> 01:34:57,816
I seen a lady have her nipples
clamped to the door...

1549
01:34:57,922 --> 01:35:00,117
and have somebody slam the door.

1550
01:35:00,224 --> 01:35:02,852
"Oh. Yeah! Yeah!

1551
01:35:07,799 --> 01:35:10,131
Now take 'em off the hinges
and throw the doors.

1552
01:35:10,234 --> 01:35:12,395
Yeah! Yeah!"

1553
01:35:13,504 --> 01:35:15,096
So please...

1554
01:35:15,206 --> 01:35:16,571
be gentle with that.

1555
01:35:17,709 --> 01:35:21,236
And who is puttin' gerbils
in their ass?

1556
01:35:21,345 --> 01:35:23,176
Stop it!

1557
01:35:23,281 --> 01:35:25,772
Them gerbils ain't done
nothin' to nobody.

1558
01:35:25,883 --> 01:35:28,909
Them little rodents ride that wheel.
you snatch 'em. Put 'em in your ass.

1559
01:35:29,020 --> 01:35:31,921
Stop that.
I hope they scratch your ass out.

1560
01:35:33,091 --> 01:35:36,117
Hope you wind up in a hospital
sounding like a Chinese movie.

1561
01:35:36,227 --> 01:35:38,127
"Doctor! Doctor!

1562
01:35:38,229 --> 01:35:40,288
The rodent's up in my ass!"

1563
01:35:40,398 --> 01:35:43,299
Scratch his ass out. Little rodent.
Scratch his ass out.

1564
01:35:44,669 --> 01:35:48,400
You know the doctor gonna tell you.
"I can get him out.

1565
01:35:48,506 --> 01:35:51,339
But first you're gonna have to
fill out some paperwork."

1566
01:35:51,442 --> 01:35:54,434
"Hurry up. Doctor!
Hurry up. Doctor!"

1567
01:35:56,681 --> 01:35:58,649
So please...

1568
01:35:58,750 --> 01:36:01,480
be cautious with your sex.
be gentle with your sex.

1569
01:36:01,586 --> 01:36:04,248
Be gentle with your lovemaking.
Love one another.

1570
01:36:04,355 --> 01:36:05,413
Another thing. Fellas.

1571
01:36:05,523 --> 01:36:07,548
Have you ever...

1572
01:36:07,658 --> 01:36:09,922
been doing it so good...

1573
01:36:10,027 --> 01:36:12,188
so wonderful...

1574
01:36:12,296 --> 01:36:14,093
The mood is right.

1575
01:36:14,198 --> 01:36:15,597
The lights are dim.

1576
01:36:16,701 --> 01:36:19,067
It's probably dark...

1577
01:36:19,170 --> 01:36:23,334
but not quite dark.
'cause your bodies. They silhouette.

1578
01:36:23,441 --> 01:36:25,636
You can see each other.

1579
01:36:25,743 --> 01:36:30,146
The music is going. It seems to be
going with your emotion and your flow.

1580
01:36:30,248 --> 01:36:32,546
Everything's working that night.

1581
01:36:32,650 --> 01:36:34,049
"Ooh. Girl.

1582
01:36:35,720 --> 01:36:38,120
Why you do this to me. Girl?

1583
01:36:39,223 --> 01:36:41,123
Oh. That is so nice.

1584
01:36:41,225 --> 01:36:44,217
It's so moist. So wet.

1585
01:36:45,096 --> 01:36:47,963
Wow. It's so hot."

1586
01:36:48,065 --> 01:36:50,727
And you're going.
"My goodness. Girl.

1587
01:36:50,835 --> 01:36:52,962
You just so wet.

1588
01:36:53,070 --> 01:36:55,470
What. You gettin'
extra wet for me tonight?

1589
01:36:55,573 --> 01:36:58,235
Extra. Extra. Extra?"

1590
01:36:58,342 --> 01:37:02,369
All over you. You can feel it
all over your thighs. Everywhere.

1591
01:37:05,817 --> 01:37:07,717
Then you get up
and you cut on the lights.

1592
01:37:07,819 --> 01:37:09,787
Blood every-fucking-where.

1593
01:37:16,427 --> 01:37:18,486
It looks like a fucking massacre.

1594
01:37:24,936 --> 01:37:29,532
You look at your dick like
it's a knife. "Why? Why?"

1595
01:37:31,342 --> 01:37:34,971
You look at the bed.
It looks like a crime scene.

1596
01:37:37,315 --> 01:37:39,909
"Why? Why. Why. Why?"

1597
01:37:41,686 --> 01:37:44,052
You look at her.

1598
01:37:44,155 --> 01:37:46,885
"Why didn't you tell me?"

1599
01:37:46,991 --> 01:37:48,390
Ladies got the perfect answer.

1600
01:37:48,492 --> 01:37:50,790
"You must have brought it down!"

1601
01:37:51,729 --> 01:37:52,957
God bless.

1602
01:37:53,064 --> 01:37:55,589
Ride this motherfucker
till the wheels fall off.
