I don't want to see you,
you want to see me?

175
00:11:58,867 --> 00:12:00,984
Yeah. Would a breakfast work?

JULIE: I believed her.
What kind of idiot am I?

177
00:12:06,875 --> 00:12:10,377
She said, "It's about
our generation turning 30."

178
00:12:10,444 --> 00:12:13,079

Annabelle was always a liar.

187
00:12:36,887 --> 00:12:38,672
Anyway, the picture was good.

188
00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:39,940

189
00:12:40,008 --> 00:12:41,207
Just your face.

190
00:12:46,147 --> 00:12:49,649
JULIE: I forgot to tell you.
Do you know what
Annabelle's doing now?

191
00:12:49,717 --> 00:12:51,568
Sarah told me. A blog.

192
00:12:51,635 --> 00:12:52,636
Of what?

193
00:12:52,704 --> 00:12:55,706
What do you mean "of what"?
A blog of Annabelle.

194
00:12:55,774 --> 00:12:58,509
Of every thought that
passes through her brain.

195
00:12:58,576 --> 00:13:01,761
Her stupid,
vapid, insipid...

196
00:13:03,931 --> 00:13:06,249
I could write a blog.

197
00:13:06,317 --> 00:13:08,102
I have thoughts.

198
00:13:08,169 --> 00:13:10,470
And you're a writer,
which is more than
I can say for Annabelle.

199
00:13:10,537 --> 00:13:11,838
If only that were true.

200
00:13:11,906 --> 00:13:13,490
You wrote a novel.

201
00:13:13,274 --> 00:13:17,161
Half a novel. And no one
wanted to publish it.

202
00:13:17,028 --> 00:13:20,047
You're not a writer
unless someone
publishes you.

203
00:13:20,114 --> 00:13:22,131
See, that's what's
so great about blogs.

204
00:13:22,199 --> 00:13:23,834
You don't have
to be published.

205
00:13:23,902 --> 00:13:29,473
You can just go online,
press enter and
there it is, out there.

206
00:13:29,540 --> 00:13:31,508
What would I write
a blog about?

207
00:13:31,576 --> 00:13:33,260
You're an editor, tell me.

208
00:13:33,378 --> 00:13:36,997
Why don't you write about
how much you love Queens?

209
00:13:39,033 --> 00:13:40,550
A short blog.

210
00:13:42,403 --> 00:13:46,239
You could write
about your job.

211
00:13:47,926 --> 00:13:49,292
If I wrote a blog
about my job

212
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:50,661
and anyone at work
ever read it...

213
00:13:50,728 --> 00:13:52,029
I mean, hello.

214
00:13:52,013 --> 00:13:53,931
This is good.
- Mmm-hmm.

215
00:13:53,998 --> 00:13:55,566
This is really good.

216
00:13:55,633 --> 00:13:57,901
On top of which,
the whole idea
of writing a blog

217
00:13:57,968 --> 00:14:00,120
is to get away
from what I do all day.

218
00:14:00,188 --> 00:14:03,257
The way that cooking
is a way that I get away
from what I do all day.

219
00:14:03,324 --> 00:14:05,558
So write a blog
about cooking.

220
00:14:07,896 --> 00:14:11,631
I'm not a real cook,
like Julia Child
or Mario Batali.

221
00:14:11,699 --> 00:14:14,467
Julia Child wasn't
always Julia Child.

222
00:14:19,791 --> 00:14:22,626
If I really wanted
to learn to cook,

223
00:14:22,694 --> 00:14:26,162
I could just
cook my way through
Julia Child's cookbook.

224
00:14:26,230 --> 00:14:28,431
I could blog about that.

225
00:14:28,499 --> 00:14:32,585
I have a copy.
I stole it from my mother
last time I was in Texas.

226
00:14:34,522 --> 00:14:36,656
When I was eight,

227
00:14:36,724 --> 00:14:39,276
my father's boss
came to dinner and
it was a really big deal,

228
00:14:39,343 --> 00:14:42,145
and my mother made
<i>boeuf bourguignon.</i>

229
00:14:42,213 --> 00:14:43,881
But it wasn't just
<i>boeuf bourguignon.</i>

230
00:14:43,948 --> 00:14:47,183
It was Julia's
<i>boeuf bourguignon.</i>

231
00:14:47,251 --> 00:14:48,552
And it was like
she was there,

232
00:14:48,620 --> 00:14:52,322
like Julia was
there in the room,

233
00:14:52,390 --> 00:14:58,629
on our side like some
great big good fairy.

234
00:14:58,696 --> 00:15:01,581
And everything was
going to be all right.

235
00:15:05,086 --> 00:15:09,205
<i>I'm gonna try to flip</i>
<i>this thing over now,</i>

236
00:15:09,273 --> 00:15:12,792
<i>which is a rather</i>
<i>daring thing to do.</i>

237
00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:14,211
She changed everything.

238
00:15:14,279 --> 00:15:16,379
Before her,
it was frozen food

239
00:15:16,447 --> 00:15:18,481
and can openers
and marshmallows.

240
00:15:18,549 --> 00:15:21,501
Don't knock marshmallows.

241
00:15:21,569 --> 00:15:23,503
<i>When you flip anything,</i>

242
00:15:23,571 --> 00:15:28,075
<i>you've just got</i>
<i>to have the courage</i>
<i>of your convictions.</i>

243
00:15:28,142 --> 00:15:31,445
<i>Especially if it's</i>
<i>a loose sort of mass like...</i>

244
00:15:31,512 --> 00:15:35,182
<i>Oh, that didn't go very well.</i>

245
00:15:35,249 --> 00:15:37,050
<i>But, you see,</i>
<i>when I flipped it,</i>

246
00:15:37,118 --> 00:15:40,654
<i>I didn't have</i>
<i>the courage I needed...</i>
<i>- She's so adorable.</i>

247
00:15:40,722 --> 00:15:43,640
<i>...the way I should've.</i>

248
00:15:43,708 --> 00:15:46,776
<i>But you can always</i>
<i>put it together.</i>

249
00:15:46,845 --> 00:15:52,682
<i>And you're alone</i>
<i>in the kitchen.</i>
<i>Who's to see?</i>

250
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:54,851
Pearls. The woman
is wearing pearls
in the kitchen.

251

<i>practice, like the piano.</i>

261
00:16:33,941 --> 00:16:36,393
Okay, here's a problem.
I've never eaten an egg.

262
00:16:36,461 --> 00:16:39,396
And I have a hyperacidic
stomach. We'll deal.

263
00:16:40,865 --> 00:16:45,101
So I'll cook my way through
the Julia Child cookbook

264
00:16:45,169 --> 00:16:46,870
and write a blog about it.

265
00:16:46,937 --> 00:16:48,572

need a deadline.

266

267
00:16:50,158 --> 00:16:52,559

<i>of my whole life,</i>
<i>ever, ever, ever.</i>

505
00:29:16,904 --> 00:29:21,240
I thought eggs
were going to be greasy
and slimy, but it tastes like

506
00:29:22,475 --> 00:29:24,810
cheese sauce. Yum.

507
00:29:25,962 --> 00:29:27,746
Julia Child,
you are so good.

508
00:29:27,814 --> 00:29:29,282
Cheers.
- Cheers.

509
00:29:29,349 --> 00:29:31,951
And, may I say, excellent wine?
- Mmm-hmm.

510
00:29:32,019 --> 00:29:33,719
Do you think
Julia knows about you?

511
00:29:33,787 --> 00:29:35,504
I wish.

512
00:29:35,572 --> 00:29:37,223

that she comes for dinner

513
00:29:37,290 --> 00:29:39,358

my new lemon zester.

514
00:29:39,425 --> 00:29:41,227
We become very close.

515
00:29:42,929 --> 00:29:45,998
The truth is,
no one knows about me.

516
00:29:46,066 --> 00:29:49,985
I feel like
I'm just sending things
into this giant void.

Annabelle's blog.
Have you read it lately?

518
00:29:53,740 --> 00:29:55,307
Yes.

519
00:29:55,375 --> 00:29:57,093

00:29:57,160 --> 00:29:58,628

521
00:29:58,695 --> 00:30:00,713
She's dating
this rich guy

523
00:30:02,549 --> 00:30:06,085

It's completely normal.

Today we will begin
by learning to boil eggs.

537
00:30:57,620 --> 00:31:03,225
First, you must make sure
that the egg is fresh.

538
00:31:03,293 --> 00:31:06,846

a little more advanced,

But you are
not an advanced cook.

541
00:31:14,871 --> 00:31:18,040
But I do know
how to boil an egg.

542
00:31:18,826 --> 00:31:21,644
Do you know how
to bone a duck?

543
00:31:21,712 --> 00:31:25,147
No, but that's exactly
the sort of thing

544
00:31:25,215 --> 00:31:28,818

in learning how to do.
- Mmm.

545
00:31:32,506 --> 00:31:35,841

Well, you should've
seen the way

- Who is Avis?

840
00:48:01,009 --> 00:48:05,280
My friend, Avis De Voto,

Massachusetts.

841

She's very wise.

I want a diploma.

846
00:48:26,869 --> 00:48:28,203

847
00:48:28,271 --> 00:48:29,871
Threaten her?
With what?

848
00:48:29,939 --> 00:48:32,207
The United States of America.

849

Yes!

It's a veal chop

That's the surprise.

I can?

872
00:49:53,055 --> 00:49:54,372
Of course.

873
00:49:54,440 --> 00:49:57,442

Yes, we're going

Madame Child,
I must tell you,

879
00:50:11,624 --> 00:50:16,127
you have no real

880

1006
00:57:05,421 --> 00:57:08,589
People were dropping
like flies all around me!

1007
00:57:11,059 --> 00:57:13,844
Look.
Oh, my goodness.

1008
00:57:13,912 --> 00:57:15,663
Look at that.

1009
00:57:17,499 --> 00:57:20,801
All I think about
all day is food

1010
00:57:20,869 --> 00:57:23,771
and then I dream
about it all night.

1011
00:57:24,906 --> 00:57:26,591
It is true, she's obsessed.

1012
00:57:26,658 --> 00:57:29,343
If I didn't sit
in the kitchen,
I'd never see her.

1013
00:57:29,411 --> 00:57:34,849
Last week, I dreamed that
I made  <i>cassoulet</i> for Dad,

1014
00:57:34,917 --> 00:57:37,351
and he hated it, of course.

1015
00:57:37,419 --> 00:57:39,887
He doesn't
understand any of this.

1016
00:57:39,955 --> 00:57:41,789
I almost feel sorry for him.

1017
00:57:41,857 --> 00:57:44,959
He wanted so much
for us to stay in Pasadena,

1018
00:57:45,027 --> 00:57:48,229
marry Republicans,
and breed like rabbits.

1019
00:57:48,296 --> 00:57:49,731
Why didn't we?

1020
00:57:49,798 --> 00:57:50,848
Too tall.

1021
00:57:50,915 --> 00:57:52,950
Let's face it, it's true.

1022
00:57:53,018 --> 00:57:55,586
From the beginning,
you just don't fit in.
Literally.

1023
00:57:55,654 --> 00:57:57,054
So then you don't.

1024
00:57:57,122 --> 00:57:58,456
I know, it's true.

1025
00:57:58,524 --> 00:58:01,559
Do not bait Father
about politics when he comes.

1026
00:58:01,627 --> 00:58:04,094
No.
- Or he won't pick up the check.

1027
00:58:04,162 --> 00:58:07,181
He won't, will he?
- I can't make any promises.

1028
00:58:07,249 --> 00:58:08,916
He loves Senator McCarthy.

1029
00:58:08,983 --> 00:58:10,251
Oh, I know.

1030
00:58:10,318 --> 00:58:11,485
Pasadena.
- Pasadena.

1031
00:58:11,553 --> 00:58:12,619
Jinx.

1032
00:58:12,687 --> 00:58:15,623
(BOTH EXCLAIMING)

1033
00:58:16,074 --> 00:58:17,742
(BOTH LAUGHING)

1034
00:58:20,428 --> 00:58:22,413
Dort, do you have...
You have the Brie.

1035
00:58:22,481 --> 00:58:24,198
Is this the Brie?
- Yes. Yes, that's the Brie.

1036
00:58:24,266 --> 00:58:27,518
Is that not
the most wonderful cheese
you ever had in your life?

1037
00:58:27,585 --> 00:58:29,219
Yes!
- Yes.

1038
00:58:29,287 --> 00:58:30,955
The answer's yes.

1039
00:58:31,623 --> 00:58:32,707
Mmm.

1040
00:58:35,143 --> 00:58:37,862
I got the chef
at Chez la Mere Michel

1041
00:58:37,929 --> 00:58:40,498
to give me the recipe
for  <i>beurre blanc.</i>

1042
00:58:40,565 --> 00:58:42,900
<i>Beurre blanc.</i>
What's  <i>beurre blanc?</i>

1043
00:58:42,968 --> 00:58:46,570
Butter in a white wine vinegar reduction.
- Oh, I love butter.

1044
00:58:47,472 --> 00:58:49,673
You whisk them together,

1045
00:58:49,741 --> 00:58:54,411
and the acid in the vinegar
works on the milk solids
in the butter

1046
00:58:54,479 --> 00:58:57,648
so that the butter,
instead of melting,
becomes this

1047
00:58:57,716 --> 00:59:00,784
creamy, light, frothy,

1048
00:59:00,852 --> 00:59:05,288
with kind of a fantastic
subtle kind of...

1049
00:59:05,356 --> 00:59:06,724
PAUL: Tangy.

1050
00:59:07,309 --> 00:59:09,292
It has a tanginess.

1051
00:59:09,678 --> 00:59:11,329
Tanginess?

1052
00:59:11,396 --> 00:59:12,529
Yes.

1053
00:59:13,531 --> 00:59:15,066
Well, that's...

1054
00:59:17,002 --> 00:59:18,719
That's who I married.

1055
00:59:19,671 --> 00:59:21,522
Anyway,

1056
00:59:21,590 --> 00:59:26,227
you serve it on fish
and it's splendid.
I'm going to make it for you.

1057
00:59:26,294 --> 00:59:28,028
That'll be divine.
- Yeah.

1058
00:59:28,096 --> 00:59:30,764
And, Dort, we're going
to throw you a party.
