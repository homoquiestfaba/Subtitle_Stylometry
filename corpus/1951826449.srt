1
00:01:55,085 --> 00:01:57,417
Oh shit,thanks.
İ didn't see that

2
00:01:57,621 --> 00:01:58,747
Me neither.

3
00:02:00,324 --> 00:02:05,317
People say, "seeing is believing"
But for me that's not entirely true.

4
00:02:05,963 --> 00:02:09,956
I lost my sight when I was 5 years old.
those memories of what I have seen...

5
00:02:11,201 --> 00:02:14,932
had.... so much that i doubted even recognise
myself anymore.

6
00:02:14,972 --> 00:02:18,965
Now I see using my other senses.
I can smell the rain before it drops.

7
00:02:20,044 --> 00:02:23,946
But I can not watch it fall
I can feel the sun on my face.

8
00:02:23,981 --> 00:02:27,974
But I can not see a rise or set
I want to see the world like everyone else.

9
00:02:28,752 --> 00:02:32,153
to see the sun, rain and music.

10
00:02:32,189 --> 00:02:34,749
I bet that the music looks beautiful.

11
00:03:31,048 --> 00:03:33,539
Thank you.

12
00:03:39,456 --> 00:03:41,151
Happy Birthday.

13
00:03:45,763 --> 00:03:48,755
-Good evening, Miss. Wells

-Lilies.
-They're from this morning.

16
00:03:54,671 --> 00:03:58,607
I saw it was paper roses but,
you're the first one who has noticed.

17
00:04:02,246 --> 00:04:04,111
Nerveous about tomorrow?

18
00:04:04,448 --> 00:04:05,244
No.

19
00:04:08,752 --> 00:04:12,552
Actually, I had never
Been so scared in my entire life.

20
00:04:13,457 --> 00:04:16,756
Listen, the night before
The my mother's surgery,

21
00:04:16,827 --> 00:04:19,261
she drank two glasses of sherry.

22
00:04:20,664 --> 00:04:24,225
-She was like rock the next day.
-Thanks.

23
00:04:26,036 --> 00:04:27,731
- Good night.
- Good night

24
00:04:43,087 --> 00:04:46,523

00:07:05,996 --> 00:07:07,088

00:07:07,497 --> 00:07:12,490
I know, Sydney Wells, i've kinda read your chart.
You had a cornea transfer.

37
00:07:13,036 --> 00:07:15,834
-How old are you?
-9.5 .

38
00:07:16,406 --> 00:07:20,103
There is, this like a golf ball things in my head,

39
00:07:20,510 --> 00:07:23,308
Beacuse of this disease i couldn't
ever ride my bike

40
00:07:23,347 --> 00:07:25,747
So the doctors are trying to get it out.

41
00:07:25,816 --> 00:07:29,047
-When will you get to see?
-Pretty soon, i think.

42
00:07:29,119 --> 00:07:32,452
Good,i'll come back,
and you can take a look at me.

43
00:07:35,125 --> 00:07:37,252
Bye, nice to meet you.

44
00:07:37,327 --> 00:07:38,658
Bye.

45
00:07:47,070 --> 00:07:50,005
I'm starting to lose the
feeling of my fingers.

46
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:51,166
Me, too.

47
00:07:56,179 --> 00:07:57,669
Would you excuse me, please?

48
00:08:02,819 --> 00:08:06,152
All right, Sydney.
We'll take the bandages off.

49
00:08:06,189 --> 00:08:07,918
-Ready?
-Yeah.

50
00:08:20,737 --> 00:08:21,726
That's one.

51
00:08:26,043 --> 00:08:27,408
That's two.

52
00:08:31,148 --> 00:08:35,141
Now,i'm gonna help you,
to open your eyes,very slowly.

53
00:08:36,053 --> 00:08:37,611
Okey.

54
00:08:41,725 --> 00:08:43,249
Slowly, slowly, slowly.

55
00:08:49,533 --> 00:08:52,297
Great. Tell me what you're seeing.

56
00:09:01,378 --> 00:09:02,970
I can't...

57
00:09:04,614 --> 00:09:06,479
i'm gonna hold up my hand

58
00:09:07,417 --> 00:09:10,978
...and i want you to tell me,
how many fingers i have at, okey.

59
00:09:12,389 --> 00:09:13,788
Those are your fingers.

60
00:09:14,124 --> 00:09:15,785
Yes, they are.

61
00:09:16,927 --> 00:09:18,485
Here we go.

62
00:09:19,796 --> 00:09:21,593
All of them?

63
00:09:21,631 --> 00:09:24,794
Yes, very good.

64
00:09:27,704 --> 00:09:32,697
Sydney,i want you to try and reach out
and grab my hand.

65
00:09:42,519 --> 00:09:46,512
It's okay.Not everybody can do
this right away,it's okay.

66
00:09:57,634 --> 00:10:00,626
-It burns a little.
-Is that normal?

67
00:10:00,670 --> 00:10:04,037
Yeah, it's perfectly normal.

68
00:10:04,474 --> 00:10:05,634
Thank you.

69
00:10:08,845 --> 00:10:11,245
Am i how you pictured?

70
00:10:14,251 --> 00:10:15,684
I don't know.

71
00:10:16,453 --> 00:10:18,785
You are really blurry.

72
00:10:21,758 --> 00:10:24,420
I wish my mom and dad would
be here to see this.

73
00:10:24,461 --> 00:10:25,553
Yeah...

74
00:10:26,496 --> 00:10:29,863
I think I wanted this more than you,Sydney.

75
00:10:32,769 --> 00:10:35,101
....you were twelve

76
00:10:35,872 --> 00:10:40,865
I have waited for this i thought i...
i feel sensetive now

77
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:45,575
It's not your fault.

78
00:10:51,121 --> 00:10:53,021
It's not your fault.

79
00:10:56,660 --> 00:10:58,423
I'm sorry.

80
00:10:58,929 --> 00:11:00,760
I just need time.

81
00:11:01,331 --> 00:11:02,559
You'll see.

82
00:11:09,039 --> 00:11:10,666
-Good night.
-Good night.

83
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:12,640
-I love you.
-I love you, too.

84
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:33,860
Sydney, can you see me?

85
00:11:35,198 --> 00:11:37,098
Don't feel bad if you can't.

86
00:11:38,101 --> 00:11:40,501
What's that on your head?

87
00:11:40,570 --> 00:11:43,403
That's a bandana,
my grandpa gave it to me.

88
00:11:43,874 --> 00:11:47,674
You know,maybe tomorrow we can take a walk
and i can try to park outside.

89
00:11:47,711 --> 00:11:50,475
-Palm trees....
-Alicia.

90
00:11:50,514 --> 00:11:51,378
Oh, coming.

91
00:11:51,414 --> 00:11:55,214
-....., i gotta go.
-Bye.

92
00:12:21,778 --> 00:12:23,939
Please. I don't want to go.

93
00:12:32,856 --> 00:12:34,346
Mrs. Hillman?

94
00:12:46,202 --> 00:12:47,191
Mrs. Hillman?

95
00:12:57,814 --> 00:12:59,543
Where are you taking her?

96
00:13:32,349 --> 00:13:33,680
Mrs. Hillman?

97
00:13:56,506 --> 00:13:58,633
Where are you taking her?

98
00:14:32,142 --> 00:14:34,337
Freezing.

99
00:14:35,979 --> 00:14:37,173
Freezing.

100
00:14:41,551 --> 00:14:43,246
Freezing.

101
00:15:13,516 --> 00:15:15,450
Where is Mrs Hillman?

102
00:15:16,619 --> 00:15:19,611
I'm sorry, she passed away last night.

103
00:15:29,532 --> 00:15:31,932
Everything is just perfect.

104
00:15:31,968 --> 00:15:35,961
You're recovering quite nicely.
And the tearing is stopped.

105
00:15:36,740 --> 00:15:39,732
-I think so, yeah.
-Good.

106
00:15:44,647 --> 00:15:48,014
-So, whose eyes were this?
-Excuse me?

107
00:15:48,051 --> 00:15:49,780
My donor?

108
00:15:49,853 --> 00:15:53,289
I'm afraid i can't help you
with that Sydney.These are your eyes now
and they're working.

109
00:15:53,356 --> 00:15:56,291
I shouldn't matter where it came from.
It hurts?

110
00:15:56,693 --> 00:15:58,593
Yes , a little.

111
00:16:03,133 --> 00:16:05,693
When will i be able to see clearly?

112
00:16:06,436 --> 00:16:10,167
Varies with each patient,
A couple of days or weeks.

113
00:16:10,206 --> 00:16:14,899
But your vision itself isn't the issue,
Because you were blind so long

114
00:16:14,944 --> 00:16:18,937
so i'm going to refer you a specialist.
Paul Faulkner, he'll help you.

115
00:16:21,751 --> 00:16:23,343
-You all right?
-Yeah.

116
00:16:25,655 --> 00:16:28,317
-Have a nice day tomorrow.
-Thanks, Sydney.

117
00:17:51,474 --> 00:17:54,136
-Hi.
-Hey.

118
00:17:56,312 --> 00:17:58,177
Are you ready to be my tour guide?

119
00:17:59,182 --> 00:18:00,206
Are you leaving?

120
00:18:00,516 --> 00:18:04,509
Yeah,i'm afraid they have had enough for me here.
This is my sister Hellen.Hellen, this is Alicia.

121
00:18:05,488 --> 00:18:06,477
Hi.

122
00:18:06,890 --> 00:18:09,586
-Can we get a picture together?
-Of course.

123
00:18:09,626 --> 00:18:11,594

00:18:45,628 --> 00:18:49,325
No,we can talk everyday, you can come over

I don't know what he was thinking.

137
00:19:31,207 --> 00:19:32,504

-Nice to see you.
-Nice to see you, too.

141
00:19:41,818 --> 00:19:44,514
Sydney, it's Brett.

142
00:19:45,321 --> 00:19:48,813
Hey, Syd.
It's me, Alex from the upstairs.

143
00:19:49,025 --> 00:19:50,822
Alex, nice to see you.

144
00:19:51,527 --> 00:19:53,358
It's your cousin, Sarah.

145
00:19:55,665 --> 00:19:58,828
-It has been so long.
-I am so happy.

146
00:19:58,868 --> 00:20:00,426

147
00:20:01,471 --> 00:20:03,132
Hi, Cynthia.

148
00:20:03,940 --> 00:20:05,737
How could i not, Cynthia.

149
00:20:07,844 --> 00:20:11,177
-Richard, hi.
-How are you doing?

150
00:20:13,650 --> 00:20:16,646
So, this is how bold looks like.

151
00:20:17,086 --> 00:20:21,079
-Hey, Sydney. How are you?
-Miguel, how are you?

152
00:20:21,591 --> 00:20:22,649
You look good.

153
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:26,487
Hello honey.

154
00:20:27,797 --> 00:20:29,788
-How are you feeling?
-Take a breath.

155
00:20:30,166 --> 00:20:31,690
Hi, how are you?

156
00:20:40,610 --> 00:20:43,374
Are you okay?
Do you need some water or anything?

157
00:20:43,413 --> 00:20:46,780
Yeah,i'm gonna got to the kitchen.
Why don't you stay with the guests?

158
00:20:48,184 --> 00:20:50,175
Thank you for coming.

159
00:22:49,272 --> 00:22:51,502

160
00:23:07,123 --> 00:23:08,249
-Hi.
-Hi.

161
00:23:08,558 --> 00:23:09,923
Sorry, i'm late.

162
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:12,752
That's Henry.

163
00:23:15,631 --> 00:23:17,724
-I'm Paul.
-Sydney.

164
00:23:21,771 --> 00:23:22,931
Have a seat?

165
00:23:37,053 --> 00:23:39,521
You've damaged your cornea,
when you were five.

166
00:23:39,555 --> 00:23:42,854
Yeah, my sister and i were
playing with firecrackers.

167
00:23:42,892 --> 00:23:46,293
I tried a transplant,when i was 12.
But i rejected them

168
00:23:47,063 --> 00:23:51,056
-Ayrıntılı araştırma.
Have you tried again?

169
00:23:51,701 --> 00:23:55,694
No, my sister was really the one
who kept up with all that stuff.

170
00:24:02,812 --> 00:24:06,213
These are Dr. Haskin's test results.

171
00:24:06,549 --> 00:24:10,076
There's nothing physically wrong with you.
Opeartion went flawlessly.

172
00:24:10,119 --> 00:24:12,519
-but you were probably... for a shock
-Why?

173
00:24:12,555 --> 00:24:15,820
You've already felt the information
from sound, smell and touch.

174
00:24:15,858 --> 00:24:21,851
But now,you're gonna be assaulted by a
million things you never even knew existed.

175
00:24:23,132 --> 00:24:25,623
That is an all
new level of confusion.

176
00:24:25,968 --> 00:24:31,961
Do i look here, here,is that bright thing important,
is dark one moving toward me or away from me...

177
00:24:32,575 --> 00:24:34,702
...dangerous or not?

178
00:24:34,744 --> 00:24:38,737
As long as your eyes are open,
there are just too many distractions,

179
00:24:39,081 --> 00:24:42,073
I mean, how do you consantrate?
I'm talking to you...

180
00:24:42,852 --> 00:24:46,845
...and you're looking at that one and
you're thinking if you're gonna eat that.

181
00:24:47,490 --> 00:24:50,084
They are pineapple,by the way.
You cut it open.

182
00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:52,354
I like pineapple.

183
00:24:53,696 --> 00:24:55,163
Sorry.

184
00:24:55,197 --> 00:24:59,133
Anyway,because you can see, people are gonna
expect you to deal things that you can't do

185
00:24:59,435 --> 00:25:03,394
...read signs,recognise body language, people's
gestures and facial expressions...

186
00:25:03,439 --> 00:25:07,432
and they just get out of their way.
Your wyws will wanna dominate...

187
00:25:07,610 --> 00:25:11,046
...how you perceive the world,
but you can't fully trust them, not yet.

188
00:25:11,347 --> 00:25:14,805
And the next few weeks, i gonna help
you to see the world like it really is, okay.

189
00:25:15,117 --> 00:25:18,609
Some of is gonna be wonderful, a lot of is gonna be...

190
00:25:18,654 --> 00:25:20,451
...difficul but the main thing
is to be prepared.

191
00:25:20,523 --> 00:25:22,218
And that's where i come in.

192
00:25:22,658 --> 00:25:24,717
We're in this together.

193
00:26:59,221 --> 00:27:00,984
You scared me.

194
00:27:15,104 --> 00:27:18,198
Have you seen my report card?

195
00:27:18,908 --> 00:27:20,637
Your report card?

196
00:27:23,612 --> 00:27:27,446
-Do you live here,sweetie?
-My father will be so mad at me.

197
00:27:28,651 --> 00:27:31,051
Have you seen my report card?

198
00:28:14,296 --> 00:28:15,593
Sorry.

199
00:28:16,298 --> 00:28:17,526
Let's take five.

200
00:28:18,601 --> 00:28:21,502
I'm sorry, I don't know what's
wrong with me?

201
00:28:22,705 --> 00:28:23,899
Relax.

202
00:28:24,607 --> 00:28:26,336
You're pushing too hard.

203
00:28:39,822 --> 00:28:43,349
You know, when i first went to London
to work with the Filarmonica...

204
00:28:43,425 --> 00:28:49,418
...i was so nervous.
In Prag, i was a big fish, in London
one of the hundreds.

205
00:28:51,133 --> 00:28:53,158
But you did very well in London.

206
00:28:54,069 --> 00:29:00,005
I never thought i would be ready,
but when it was time to go on...

207
00:29:00,075 --> 00:29:04,011
...everything faded away,
it was just me.

208
00:29:07,716 --> 00:29:10,207
When there was nothing
to worry about.

209
00:29:18,894 --> 00:29:22,227
Will you be ready?
We're all counting on you.

210
00:29:24,300 --> 00:29:27,201
-I'll be ready.
-I'm sure you will be.

211
00:29:27,937 --> 00:29:31,703
-22.
-22? That's us.

212
00:29:32,508 --> 00:29:34,100
-You seat, i'll take it.
-Thank you.

213
00:29:46,322 --> 00:29:49,155
Did you think i'm just
gonna let you to go?

214
00:29:50,526 --> 00:29:53,518
You think i'm not gonna do something?
That's right?

215
00:29:58,133 --> 00:30:01,330
-I'm gonna do it.
-I'm sorry.

216
00:30:01,370 --> 00:30:03,634
I told you i was gonna do it.

217
00:30:08,544 --> 00:30:10,136
I'm gonna do it.

218
00:30:27,563 --> 00:30:29,360
What happened?

219
00:30:30,566 --> 00:30:33,763
There was a woman,
she came in me.

220
00:30:34,903 --> 00:30:36,097
What woman?

221
00:30:37,272 --> 00:30:38,705
What woman?

222
00:30:40,576 --> 00:30:43,477
Christ,Sydney you gotta hold off
yourself, please.

223
00:30:45,180 --> 00:30:46,511
Sorry.

224
00:30:47,182 --> 00:30:48,479
Sorry.

225
00:30:50,886 --> 00:30:52,376
I apologize.

226
00:30:52,421 --> 00:30:53,683
It's allright.

227
00:33:02,317 --> 00:33:03,807
Well.

228
00:33:05,254 --> 00:33:09,247
For the latest results,there is
nothing wrong with your eyes.

229
00:33:12,628 --> 00:33:15,119
Maybe there is something
wrong with the tests.

230
00:33:15,531 --> 00:33:18,523
Test only gaves us the fact that you gave...
normal responses

231
00:33:18,934 --> 00:33:22,870
Creative ones yeah, like a kinda artist andmusicians give

232
00:33:22,938 --> 00:33:24,838
But last i've checked
you're a musician.

233
00:33:25,774 --> 00:33:29,369
I'm sure other musicians don't
see what i'm gonna see.

234
00:33:30,145 --> 00:33:31,271
Come with me.

235
00:33:32,581 --> 00:33:33,980
I'm not an idiot.

236
00:33:34,049 --> 00:33:37,382
I understand what you're telling me.
My brain's having a real learn...

237
00:33:37,452 --> 00:33:40,546
...how to decode the world around it.
But that's very different for me seeing ...

238
00:33:40,589 --> 00:33:42,489
...things that don't
seem to be real.

239
00:33:43,091 --> 00:33:46,083
Look, you're real.

240
00:33:48,163 --> 00:33:49,858
You're here.

241
00:33:50,966 --> 00:33:54,834
My perspective and focus is off,but...

242
00:33:54,870 --> 00:33:58,499
...you're real
I can see you.

243
00:34:04,513 --> 00:34:07,914
We'll see what we look at.
But the way that...

244
00:34:08,150 --> 00:34:09,515
...we see things is
affected by what we know.

245
00:34:09,818 --> 00:34:11,683
...and there is a lot around that it
can't make sense of you.

246
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:13,319
What are you saying to me?

247
00:34:14,690 --> 00:34:20,683
You think i'm making this up?
You think i want this to be happening to me?

248
00:34:21,029 --> 00:34:25,022
You think you're not gonna be able
to push through this.You think you were better before.

249
00:34:25,067 --> 00:34:26,534
More special.

250
00:34:26,935 --> 00:34:30,928
You have just discovered that
you are like the rest of us.

251
00:34:34,476 --> 00:34:38,469
You know when we've first met,
i didn't think you're such an ass.

252
00:34:41,450 --> 00:34:44,044
That's cause you didn't
know how to spot one.

253
00:34:44,486 --> 00:34:46,852
See?
Progress.

254
00:34:55,464 --> 00:34:57,625
Have a good evening Mrs. Chaline.

255
00:35:01,637 --> 00:35:04,868

Hi, you've reached the cellphone of Dr Paul Faulkner.
Leave a message after the beep.

265
00:40:29,764 --> 00:40:32,597
Hi Paul.
It's Sydney.

266
00:40:35,103 --> 00:40:37,663
I'm at a chinese restaurant on...

267
00:40:37,973 --> 00:40:40,464
....the corner of the
fourth in Figueroa.

268
00:40:43,178 --> 00:40:44,975
Something's happening to me.

269
00:40:49,784 --> 00:40:52,685
I need you to come, please.

270
00:41:12,140 --> 00:41:13,971
Excuse me.

271
00:43:10,258 --> 00:43:12,317
Sydney, it's me.

272
00:43:12,761 --> 00:43:13,819
It's me.

273
00:43:20,335 --> 00:43:21,927
This place.

274
00:43:26,374 --> 00:43:27,966
It was just here.

275
00:43:28,977 --> 00:43:30,638
What are you talking about?

276
00:43:30,678 --> 00:43:32,270
This place...

277
00:43:32,347 --> 00:43:35,976
There was a fire in here...weeks ago,
5 people were killed.

278
00:43:36,050 --> 00:43:38,917
-It was in the newspaper,it was all over the press.
-I was here.

279
00:43:38,953 --> 00:43:42,853
I was just here.
Where is this place.

280
00:43:44,092 --> 00:43:47,118
-What's wrong?
-Everything is wrong.

281
00:43:47,162 --> 00:43:50,791
Everything is wrong.
My apertment keeps changing.

282
00:43:51,466 --> 00:43:55,459
-It was smoke and i was attacked by this man.
-What do you mean "attacked"?

283
00:43:55,460 --> 00:43:56,460
He was on fire and then
he was gone.

284
00:43:55,770 --> 00:43:59,035
Everything was gone so
i had to get out there.

285
00:43:59,107 --> 00:44:03,100
And i was walking down the street and
this woman walks through me.

286
00:44:03,711 --> 00:44:07,442
She walked right through me.
and I saw the shadow.

287
00:44:08,216 --> 00:44:12,209
I saw it before, at the hospital,
it's some kind of escort...

288
00:44:12,821 --> 00:44:16,655
...takes people away when
they are dead.

289
00:44:17,125 --> 00:44:20,253
There is something so angry about them.

290
00:44:21,329 --> 00:44:23,422
They don't wanna be seen.

291
00:44:25,667 --> 00:44:29,535
And then this, i see people,
like nothing is wrong.

292
00:44:30,638 --> 00:44:33,471
but they don't seem to see me.

293
00:44:33,875 --> 00:44:35,342
Sydney, listen to me?

294
00:44:35,643 --> 00:44:39,443
I'm seeing thing that are real.
I'm seeing things that i shouldn't see.

295
00:44:40,048 --> 00:44:43,040
I'm deraming things that
I've never seen.

296
00:44:44,352 --> 00:44:47,651
This surgery was supposed to
make me normal.

297
00:44:47,956 --> 00:44:51,949
Sydney, your eyes are not
the problem.

298
00:44:52,594 --> 00:44:55,188
This eyes are not my eyes.

299
00:44:56,130 --> 00:44:57,324
-Yes they are.
-No they aren't.

300
00:44:57,699 --> 00:44:58,597
Yes they are.

301
00:44:59,133 --> 00:45:00,828
-No they aren't.
-Yes they are.

302
00:45:01,202 --> 00:45:02,226
Listen to me.

you have got a disorder

304
00:45:05,006 --> 00:45:08,999
We have gotta teach your brain how to
seperate out this ghost images from the real thing.

305
00:45:10,411 --> 00:45:11,605
You're not listening to me.

306
00:45:12,747 --> 00:45:15,011
I'm not seeing ghost images.

307
00:45:16,618 --> 00:45:18,245
I see...

308
00:45:18,520 --> 00:45:19,418
what, dead people?

309
00:45:20,154 --> 00:45:26,547
Rooms that change,phantom....
Whatever it is that you believe you're
seeing is not real.

310
00:45:30,331 --> 00:45:31,355
It's not.

311
00:45:33,535 --> 00:45:34,467
It's not real.

312
00:45:35,637 --> 00:45:36,865
You don't believe me.

313
00:45:39,941 --> 00:45:41,431
I wanna help you.

314
00:45:41,676 --> 00:45:42,734

How can you if you don't beileve me?

316
00:46:23,117 --> 00:46:24,311
You get on or what?

317
00:47:19,407 --> 00:47:21,739
It's not real.
No no, It's not real.

318
00:47:28,516 --> 00:47:30,006
It's not real.

319
00:47:31,152 --> 00:47:32,813
It's not real.

320
00:47:33,721 --> 00:47:35,120
It's not real.

321
00:47:38,826 --> 00:47:40,919
It's not real.

322
00:48:16,831 --> 00:48:19,823
Have you seen my report card?

323
00:48:20,201 --> 00:48:20,997
No.

324
00:48:21,502 --> 00:48:22,491
I've already told you.

325
00:48:23,705 --> 00:48:25,195
Have you seen my report card?

326
00:48:25,506 --> 00:48:26,495
Stop asking me.

327
00:48:33,314 --> 00:48:34,713
Hayır.

328
00:49:03,211 --> 00:49:05,372

329
00:50:06,240 --> 00:50:09,232

334
00:50:35,770 --> 00:50:36,794

00:50:57,025 --> 00:50:58,551
Mrs Wells.

338
00:51:07,735 --> 00:51:09,566
Can you give us a minute?

339
00:51:10,037 --> 00:51:10,833
Sure.

340
00:51:22,149 --> 00:51:24,242
Your sister called, she said you
haven't answered the phone...

341
00:51:42,370 --> 00:51:43,769
What is this?

342
00:51:44,372 --> 00:51:45,669
You wanna be blind again?

343
00:51:47,575 --> 00:51:52,568
At least you  were right when you were blind, you had a life,
you were engaged with the world ,you had a job.
Now, what is this?

344
00:51:53,314 --> 00:51:56,715
You get scared, you just drop out to run
back to your ..... life.****

345
00:52:28,849 --> 00:52:30,146
So what now?

346
00:52:30,651 --> 00:52:32,983
I'm gonna take you to the hospital
and get these cuts ....

347
00:52:33,587 --> 00:52:35,054
Is that really neccesary?

348
00:52:35,790 --> 00:52:36,688
Yeah.

349
00:52:38,459 --> 00:52:39,983
We'll figure this out.

350
00:52:59,347 --> 00:53:02,646
I think you should
keep her monitoring all night.
Here is my phone number.

351
00:53:17,765 --> 00:53:19,232
Sydney Wells?

352
00:53:20,968 --> 00:53:22,629
You're back.

353
00:53:23,730 --> 00:53:25,630
Alicia.

354
00:53:27,174 --> 00:53:28,766
What are you doing?

355
00:53:29,643 --> 00:53:31,440
My golfball is gone,Sydney Wells.

356
00:53:31,979 --> 00:53:33,469
-What?
-I have to go now.

357
00:53:33,881 --> 00:53:34,745
Hang on...

358
00:53:36,584 --> 00:53:37,642
Alicia.

359
00:53:44,592 --> 00:53:45,752
Alicia?

360
00:53:49,764 --> 00:53:52,358
I know you're scared, don't be.

361
00:53:52,867 --> 00:53:54,698
Because the world really
is beautiful.

362
00:54:01,909 --> 00:54:02,933
No.

363
00:54:03,511 --> 00:54:04,341
Alicia.

364
00:54:06,247 --> 00:54:07,805
Don't go with him!

365
00:54:09,050 --> 00:54:10,244
Alicia.

366
00:54:11,552 --> 00:54:12,519
Alicia.

367
00:55:01,102 --> 00:55:02,933
How are you?

368
00:55:09,310 --> 00:55:12,438
Whatever is happening,
there is nothing that can't be fixed.

369
00:55:18,519 --> 00:55:19,417
Good Morning.

370
00:55:19,753 --> 00:55:20,845
Good Morning.

371
00:55:21,455 --> 00:55:22,945
-How is your hand?
-It's fine.

372
00:55:26,727 --> 00:55:28,627
Alicia's mother wanted you to have this.

373
00:55:29,130 --> 00:55:32,930
She said, she talked about you all the time,
she was smiling up to the very end.

374
00:55:40,841 --> 00:55:42,240
Who is she?

375
00:55:43,944 --> 00:55:45,434
That's you Sydney.

376
00:55:45,779 --> 00:55:46,746
That's not me.

377
00:55:47,748 --> 00:55:49,477
Of course it is.
Who else would it be?

378
00:56:11,005 --> 00:56:12,131
What are you doing?

379
00:56:17,111 --> 00:56:18,237
Sydney.

380
00:56:20,614 --> 00:56:21,808
You're scaring me.

381
00:56:32,826 --> 00:56:34,020
What do you see?

382
00:56:42,136 --> 00:56:45,663
Cellular memory :based on the theory that
all living tissues have the capacity to remember...

383
00:56:46,173 --> 00:56:51,066
...cellular memory explains how energy
and information from...

384
00:56:51,145 --> 00:56:55,438
...a donor's tissue can transfer,consciously or
unconsciously, to the recipient

385
00:56:55,439 --> 00:57:01,139
Recently, recipients of organ transplants have begun
to report episodes of new found memories

386
00:57:01,140 --> 00:57:07,140
...thoughts, emotions and characteristics
that are often associated to the original donor.

387
00:57:10,297 --> 00:57:12,595
Sydney, i can't talk right know,i gotta go...
-Listen.

388
00:57:12,900 --> 00:57:14,561
There is no history of
schizophrenia in my family,...

389
00:57:14,602 --> 00:57:16,729
...I have never suffered
any mental condition.

390
00:57:17,004 --> 00:57:18,494
No depression no migraine, nothing.

391
00:57:18,806 --> 00:57:21,138
So for argument's sake,
let's just pretend i'm not crazy.

392
00:57:22,710 --> 00:57:24,302
All right, walk with me.

393
00:57:24,612 --> 00:57:28,605
There have been cases of transplants ....
who've actually shown character of the donor.

394
00:57:29,216 --> 00:57:30,308
Evet, cellular memory.

395
00:57:30,551 --> 00:57:33,213
There was a transplantation
in Kentucky last year.

396
00:57:33,520 --> 00:57:37,513
Almost immediately felt the urgency of pick up
smoking and health her entire life.

397
00:57:38,058 --> 00:57:39,218
Donor was a chain smoker?

398
00:57:39,526 --> 00:57:40,515
Down to the same brand

399
00:57:40,961 --> 00:57:44,727
And a few years ago, this little
girl help the police all the murder of the person

400
00:57:45,065 --> 00:57:46,930
who she got a heart from.
She kept having visions of the crime.

401
00:57:47,167 --> 00:57:49,158
There is some kinda chemical...

402
00:57:49,737 --> 00:57:52,228
Peptide,so the
mind and body communicate.

403
00:57:52,473 --> 00:57:54,100
So it's not too to suggest that...

404
00:57:54,141 --> 00:57:56,075
memories can also be access
from these organs too.

405
00:57:56,377 --> 00:57:59,107
No, because corneas are not major organs
it's like changing.........

406
00:57:59,580 --> 00:58:01,172
But there is still a chance, isn't there?

407
00:58:04,885 --> 00:58:06,876
I need that chance.

408
00:58:08,122 --> 00:58:10,590
I need to find out who
the donor was.

409
00:58:11,191 --> 00:58:13,318
I see her in the mirror everyday.

410
00:58:13,727 --> 00:58:15,627
I have to find out who she was.

411
00:58:19,533 --> 00:58:21,831
That is confidential information.

412
00:58:22,703 --> 00:58:24,500
You can't ask me to do that.

413
00:58:25,706 --> 00:58:27,697
I could lose my license.

414
00:58:30,144 --> 00:58:31,202
Your license?

415
00:58:33,814 --> 00:58:36,510
By all means,
hold on to that license.

416
00:59:03,177 --> 00:59:04,610
Sydney, come on.

417
00:59:06,914 --> 00:59:07,972
Sydney, come on.

418
00:59:16,523 --> 00:59:17,990
Thank you

419
00:59:18,692 --> 00:59:20,592
-What floor?
-14.

420
00:59:41,515 --> 00:59:42,345
Excuse me.

421
00:59:43,350 --> 00:59:44,408
Sorry.

422
00:59:46,420 --> 00:59:47,444
Thank you.

423
00:59:58,665 --> 01:00:00,132
He is here, isn't he.

424
01:00:01,835 --> 01:00:02,927
My Tommy.

425
01:00:09,643 --> 01:00:10,632
What is that about?

426
01:00:14,681 --> 01:00:16,148
Who is Tommy?

427
01:00:19,253 --> 01:00:20,151
Her son.

428
01:00:20,954 --> 01:00:22,148
Where was he?

429
01:00:23,857 --> 01:00:25,154
He is dead.

430
01:01:51,879 --> 01:01:53,278
Who are you?

431
01:01:56,517 --> 01:01:57,609
What do you want?

432
01:02:01,255 --> 01:02:02,745
I wanna help you.

433
01:02:04,224 --> 01:02:06,522
But how can i if you won't
even tell me.

434
01:02:56,810 --> 01:02:58,107
Sydney.

435
01:02:59,746 --> 01:03:00,735
Are you okay?

436
01:03:01,448 --> 01:03:02,312
Sydney,open it up.

437
01:03:02,816 --> 01:03:03,612
Open up.

438
01:03:04,918 --> 01:03:06,943
Sydney, open up.

439
01:03:07,921 --> 01:03:09,149
What the hell is going on?

440
01:03:09,423 --> 01:03:10,754
-I need to find out who she is.
-Who?

441
01:03:11,158 --> 01:03:13,558
My donor,her eyes....my eyes.

442
01:03:14,027 --> 01:03:16,860
I'm seeing what she saw.
I'm seeing what killed her.

443
01:03:17,064 --> 01:03:18,031
Sydney, please.

444
01:03:18,231 --> 01:03:19,027
Helen, don't.

445
01:03:19,633 --> 01:03:22,363
I love you, but there is no way
you can help me.

446
01:03:22,636 --> 01:03:23,830
You're not making sense.

447
01:03:24,137 --> 01:03:25,832
It's all happening to me.

448
01:03:26,640 --> 01:03:28,870
Everything that happened to
her is happening to me.

449
01:03:29,943 --> 01:03:31,934
Until i find out who she is...

450
01:03:32,379 --> 01:03:36,372
...and what she wants,
it's gonna keep happening.

451
01:03:52,165 --> 01:03:53,359
To the center please

452
01:03:55,402 --> 01:03:56,596
Hey.

453
01:04:08,949 --> 01:04:12,942
The only cornea transplanting
match in the day your surgery came from

454
01:04:14,855 --> 01:04:17,722
...Clínica De Santa Haviera
Mosianos.****

455
01:04:18,125 --> 01:04:19,649
Your donor was from Mexico.

456
01:04:22,329 --> 01:04:24,320
Do you get car sick?

457
01:04:24,731 --> 01:04:25,561
Why?

458
01:04:26,266 --> 01:04:27,824
To 15-hour drive.

459
01:04:39,079 --> 01:04:39,943
Thank you.

460
01:04:53,393 --> 01:04:56,089
Files says that your donor was
Ana Christina Martinez

461
01:04:56,496 --> 01:04:59,397
One living relative,mother worked in a
ceramics factory

462
01:05:00,033 --> 01:05:01,591
Hopefully we can track it down.

463
01:05:06,707 --> 01:05:08,436
What made you change your mind?

464
01:05:08,909 --> 01:05:10,137
About what?

465
01:05:11,344 --> 01:05:14,006
About coming down here with me?

466
01:05:14,448 --> 01:05:17,542
What did you just let me sabotage
my career in peace?

467
01:05:18,218 --> 01:05:20,914
I'm just wondering why you've changed
your mind that's it.

468
01:05:23,623 --> 01:05:25,420
Was it because you believe me?

469
01:05:49,182 --> 01:05:50,342
Paul,stop the car.

470
01:05:56,990 --> 01:05:58,685
What did you see?

471
01:05:59,726 --> 01:06:02,490
There was a fire here.
I keep seeing fire

472
01:06:17,344 --> 01:06:18,709
Maybe they know something.

473
01:06:36,463 --> 01:06:39,432
He says, all the doors were locked and nobody...

474
01:06:39,866 --> 01:06:41,959
...could get out.

475
01:06:44,538 --> 01:06:46,130
He lost a brother.

476
01:06:47,140 --> 01:06:48,334
How did it happen?

477
01:06:55,849 --> 01:06:57,476
He says something about the witch

478
01:07:54,140 --> 01:07:55,573
You see that?
"Bruta"

479
01:07:56,009 --> 01:07:57,567
I have seen it before.

480
01:07:58,211 --> 01:07:59,371
What does it mean?

481
01:08:01,381 --> 01:08:02,575
It means Witch.

482
01:08:23,103 --> 01:08:24,695
I don't think anyone is here.

483
01:08:36,850 --> 01:08:38,442
No,i work here.

484
01:08:38,718 --> 01:08:40,447
Is someone from the Martinez family here
that we can speak to?

485
01:08:42,622 --> 01:08:45,420
Mrs. Martinez is here but she is resting.

486
01:08:47,861 --> 01:08:50,022
We can wait.
It's important.

487
01:08:53,833 --> 01:08:55,232
Come in.

488
01:08:56,803 --> 01:08:57,667
Come in.

489
01:09:07,180 --> 01:09:09,273
Please don't be long.
She is not well.

490
01:09:18,858 --> 01:09:22,851
Mrs. Martinez, my name is Sydney Wells and
this is my friend Dr. Paul Faulkner.

491
01:09:23,097 --> 01:09:25,129
What do you want?

492
01:09:28,601 --> 01:09:31,195
We would like to talk about your daughter.

493
01:09:33,006 --> 01:09:35,839
I was wondering about how she died.

494
01:09:37,010 --> 01:09:39,706
What business is this of yours?

495
01:09:40,213 --> 01:09:42,044
It's hard to explain.

496
01:09:43,016 --> 01:09:44,415
I have a connection...

497
01:09:45,352 --> 01:09:46,614
...with your daughter.

498
01:10:11,845 --> 01:10:13,972
You have her eyes.

499
01:10:23,356 --> 01:10:27,349
I'm sorry for how i look. There was a fire
in the factory where i worked.

500
01:10:29,362 --> 01:10:31,159
Did your daughter died in the fire?

501
01:10:31,498 --> 01:10:35,059
No, but many other did.

502
01:10:35,935 --> 01:10:39,427
If they had listened to Ana,
they would have been saved.

503
01:10:40,073 --> 01:10:41,301
What do you mean by that?

504
01:10:41,975 --> 01:10:43,567
It doesn't matter now.

505
01:10:46,079 --> 01:10:47,774
Did Ana ever...

506
01:10:49,682 --> 01:10:52,446
...see things she couldn't explain?

507
01:10:53,787 --> 01:10:55,584
Do you see things?

508
01:10:58,825 --> 01:11:01,020
Things that are not real?

509
01:11:01,428 --> 01:11:02,224
Yeah.

510
01:11:03,730 --> 01:11:07,029
Is that terrible thing,
to see the spiritual world isn't it?

511
01:11:07,634 --> 01:11:11,627
To see souls destined to repeat death
everyday and unable to find peace?

512
01:11:13,239 --> 01:11:14,137
Yeah.

513
01:11:15,341 --> 01:11:17,468
Ana was always alone.

514
01:11:18,044 --> 01:11:20,171
People around here suffered of her
**********

515
01:11:20,780 --> 01:11:23,248
-They would blame her.
-Why would they blame her?

516
01:11:29,656 --> 01:11:31,681
Sometimes when she was a little girl...

517
01:11:32,258 --> 01:11:34,692
...she sat
in front of the person's house.

518
01:11:35,195 --> 01:11:36,685
and she'd just cry.

519
01:11:38,364 --> 01:11:40,855
and soon after somebody
in that house would die.

520
01:11:41,935 --> 01:11:45,928
I know that she wasn't doing these things,
she wasn't bringing death to anyone, but...

521
01:11:46,873 --> 01:11:49,774
...she just could see death.

522
01:11:51,611 --> 01:11:54,171

01:18:28,841 --> 01:18:29,933
I don't know what to do here.

559

560
01:18:38,618 --> 01:18:40,813

I believe you.

I see what you saw.
I know what you've been through.
I believe you.

565
01:19:07,914 --> 01:19:09,575
It was never your fault.

566
01:19:52,725 --> 01:19:54,625
How is Mrs. Martinez?

567
01:19:55,628 --> 01:19:56,822
She didn't make it.

568
01:20:28,495 --> 01:20:30,253
Thank you.

569
01:21:02,862 --> 01:21:05,126
Hey, buddy.
What is going on?

570
01:21:06,365 --> 01:21:10,165
Some high speed chase down
the American side has all border shut down.

571
01:21:10,870 --> 01:21:12,064
Nearly an hour now.

572
01:21:12,471 --> 01:21:14,132
****and make yourself comfortable.

573
01:21:14,740 --> 01:21:15,866
Great.

574
01:21:16,642 --> 01:21:17,540
Thanks.

575
01:21:25,051 --> 01:21:28,748
-How long was i out?
-Not very long.

576
01:21:30,089 --> 01:21:31,750
It's freezing.

577
01:21:35,594 --> 01:21:36,788
What's going on?

578
01:21:37,663 --> 01:21:41,360
Another some kind of chase
on the border....

579
01:21:42,368 --> 01:21:43,266
Really?

580
01:21:45,071 --> 01:21:46,561
Do you wanna play game?

581
01:22:07,626 --> 01:22:09,025
Mommy?

582
01:22:20,639 --> 01:22:22,072
Let's get back in the car.

583
01:22:23,776 --> 01:22:25,641
You're scaring little girl.
Let's go.

584
01:22:25,878 --> 01:22:26,674
Wait.

585
01:22:28,347 --> 01:22:30,645
What...
You're scaring the hell out of her.
Let's get back in the car.

586
01:22:34,053 --> 01:22:34,849
What?

587
01:22:39,658 --> 01:22:41,057
Oh, God!

588
01:22:44,864 --> 01:22:46,058
Sydney!

589
01:22:57,843 --> 01:22:59,811
Sorry about that.
You all right? Sorry.

590
01:23:03,015 --> 01:23:05,506
I see the Shadows.
They are everywhere.

591
01:23:06,051 --> 01:23:09,020
Excuse me, please.
Open up.

592
01:23:10,723 --> 01:23:13,123
Listen, there is gonna be an accident.
We don't have a lot of time.

593
01:23:13,459 --> 01:23:14,926
Please, just let me to talk to the driver.
Okay?

594
01:23:15,161 --> 01:23:15,957
Please!

595
01:23:19,832 --> 01:23:21,424
Miss, what are you doing?

596
01:23:31,844 --> 01:23:33,539
Oh my God.

597
01:23:43,556 --> 01:23:46,150
Don't you understand?
This is what she wanted me to see.

598
01:23:46,792 --> 01:23:48,760
Everything i dreamt wasn't from
Ana Christina's life. It was from this.

599
01:23:48,994 --> 01:23:50,586
Right now.

600
01:23:51,363 --> 01:23:53,957
She let me see that this was going to
happen so i wouldn't end up like her.

601
01:23:54,266 --> 01:23:55,995
She wants me to save these people.

602
01:23:58,204 --> 01:23:59,603
That's what she wants me to do.

603
01:23:59,905 --> 01:24:01,532
-Sydney.
-You have to believe me.

604
01:24:01,941 --> 01:24:03,340
You have to believe me.

605
01:24:19,225 --> 01:24:20,715
You need to get off this bus.

606
01:24:21,360 --> 01:24:22,827
Evereyone needs to get off this bus.

607
01:24:24,864 --> 01:24:26,764
All of you...
You can't stay here.

608
01:24:29,568 --> 01:24:33,129
Everyone listen to me.
You have to get off this bus.

609
01:24:33,839 --> 01:24:34,931
-Is it like a terorist thing?
-Yes.

610
01:24:36,141 --> 01:24:38,132
That's exactly what it's.
There is a bomb in the bus.

611
01:24:38,777 --> 01:24:40,472
-There is a bomb.
-Quickly.

612
01:24:41,680 --> 01:24:42,840
Get out.

613
01:24:43,849 --> 01:24:45,783
Come on.
Get out of the car.

614
01:24:46,452 --> 01:24:47,544
Everyone.

615
01:24:48,053 --> 01:24:49,645
Come on.
Go from here.

616
01:24:51,357 --> 01:24:54,451
There is a bomb in the bus.

617
01:24:54,960 --> 01:24:56,393
Come on.
Get out.

618
01:24:56,729 --> 01:24:57,991
Go, go, go.

619
01:24:58,597 --> 01:25:00,690
Come on.
Out of your car.

620
01:25:02,101 --> 01:25:03,193
Wait here, sweetie.

621
01:25:03,602 --> 01:25:06,796
What's going on?
Out of your car.

622
01:25:11,010 --> 01:25:12,841
Mom.

623
01:25:18,517 --> 01:25:20,747
Come on.
Get those people out of here.

624
01:25:21,620 --> 01:25:23,850
Get out of your car.

625
01:25:40,639 --> 01:25:41,537
Mommy!

626
01:25:42,741 --> 01:25:44,333
You all right?

627
01:25:44,677 --> 01:25:46,235
My God, she is inside.

628
01:25:50,849 --> 01:25:51,941
Open the door.

629
01:25:52,551 --> 01:25:54,041
How?
Please.

630
01:25:54,386 --> 01:25:55,876
Please, help me..

631
01:25:58,090 --> 01:25:59,580
Help.

632
01:26:03,295 --> 01:26:04,887
Stay back.
I'm gonna break the window.

633
01:26:04,897 --> 01:26:06,596
Close your eyes.

634
01:26:14,597 --> 01:26:17,597
Come here honey

635
01:26:18,944 --> 01:26:20,707
Paul, let's go.

636
01:26:22,214 --> 01:26:23,238
Hurry up!

637
01:26:23,916 --> 01:26:25,315
Come on, come on.

638
01:26:25,617 --> 01:26:26,413
Mom!

639
01:27:08,327 --> 01:27:15,885
You saved them, Sydney.
You saved them.

640
01:27:25,011 --> 01:27:27,138
Some say, seeing is bleveing.

641
01:27:27,447 --> 01:27:28,937
Now i know what they mean.

642
01:27:29,349 --> 01:27:31,510
Ana Christina tried to prevent
death.

643
01:27:32,118 --> 01:27:34,916
But she was ultimately powerless
to stop it.

644
01:27:35,521 --> 01:27:38,922
Ana and I sure both have
a blessing and a curse.

645
01:27:52,939 --> 01:27:56,875
I know, now, I don't need eyes to
see what truly matters

646
01:27:58,311 --> 01:28:01,769
The gift of Ana's sight lead me
see what i was afraid to.

647
01:28:02,315 --> 01:28:05,478
To use that vision,
to not only save myself and others...

648
01:28:05,885 --> 01:28:09,878
...but to give Ana the peace she
never found in life.
