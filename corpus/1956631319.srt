1
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:44,600
Yeah?

2
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:47,140
Can you turn down the music.

3
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:48,100
What?

4
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:50,620
Can you turn down the music!

5
00:01:50,620 --> 00:01:53,140
I'm trying to get some sleep here!

6
00:01:53,140 --> 00:01:54,800
Turn down the music?

7
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:58,100
How's that!

8
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:02,100
How's that.  Is that much better?

9
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:06,399
Turn down your damn music, or I'll come over there and turn it down myself!

10
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:10,299
All right, sucker.  You come down here, we can dance.

11
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:12,800
Hello?

12
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:14,340
Hello?

13
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:16,399
Bitch!

14
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:50,800
When I don't get enough sleep, I get
irritable.  And you don't want to make me -

15
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:32,500
'Calling VAGAN'

16
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:41,800
Wait! Who are you?

17
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,760
Just a bean trying to
get some sleep.

18
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:47,500
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!

19
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:50,240
You came here just to make us turn off
the music?

20
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:52,900
If you were listening on the phone,

21
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:55,380
I said I would come here to turn
it off myself.

22
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:56,800
What!

23
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:00,660
Are you insane?!  Do you know what you
just got yourself into?

24
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:03,900
Do you know who I am!

25
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:05,700
Do you know who my uncle is?!

26
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:07,460
Yes.

27
00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:08,599
I do.

28
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:29,380
Detective Cromwell.  Good morning.

29
00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:31,440
Yeah.

30
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:35,000
Something tells me there's nothing good about this morning.

31
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,320
What do we got here?

32
00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:39,700
Multiple gunshots were reported coming from this warehouse.

33
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:41,860
I was the first one to answer the call.

34
00:06:42,380 --> 00:06:44,700
Multiple gunshots, huh.

35
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:47,980
You do know whose warehouse this is.

36
00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:49,739
Yes, sir.

37
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:52,539
Have you gone inside yet?

38
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:56,659
No, sir.  I wanted to wait for backup.

39
00:06:57,260 --> 00:06:58,560
Well.

40
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:00,260
It's here.

41
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:08,180
My God.

42
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:10,940
What a massacre.

43
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:19,800
There's got to be a
dozen, at least a dozen dead beans here.

44
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:23,840
I guess I don't need this anymore.

45
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:44,620
These were all Cappuccino's beans.

46
00:07:44,620 --> 00:07:45,720
Mm-hmm.

47
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:48,820
It must have been some kind of gang war.

48
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:52,200
No.  This is no gang war.

49
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:56,640
Cappuccino's beans might be dumb, but they know how to use a gun.

50
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:59,919
There would have been other dead beans
here, not just them.

51
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:02,440
This something else.

52
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:04,960
Well.

53
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:06,599
One thing's for sure.

54
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:10,300
We won't need that search warrant we were trying to get, huh.

55
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:11,360
Heh.

56
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:13,099
Yeah.

57
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:15,480
I could live with this.

58
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:20,220
Detective Cromwell.  I found something here.

59
00:08:35,059 --> 00:08:40,079
'This bullet casing is the property of Killer Bean'

60
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:43,300
Killer Bean

61
00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:48,600
'The bullet is meant for someone else'

62
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:50,140
Hmm.

63
00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:52,460
What do you make of this?

64
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:56,280
This guy's got balls.  That's for sure.

65
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:03,459
We got company!

66
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:05,100
Let's go!

67
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:07,860
Stop!

68
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:09,160
Stop right there!

69
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:14,699
This is the police!  Hold it right there!

70
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:21,440
Bad idea.

71
00:09:31,580 --> 00:09:34,560
Get out of the car!  Get your hands where I
can see them!

72
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:39,720
Easy...  Easy...

73
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:45,780
Oh please, officer. Don't hurt me.

74
00:09:45,780 --> 00:09:46,959
Watch it.

75
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:49,720
Vagan.

76
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:58,660
I should have known I'd find you
here, Detective Cromwell.

77
00:09:58,660 --> 00:10:00,459
What are you doing here, Vagan?

78
00:10:00,460 --> 00:10:03,760
Well, obviously something happened in my warehouse.

79
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:06,980
I mean, can't a bean protect his own property anymore?

80
00:10:06,980 --> 00:10:10,040
Don't you mean, Cappuccino's property?

81
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:14,079
You know, your obsession with Cappuccino has become quite amusing.

82
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:17,600
Always trying to link everything back to Cappuccino.

83
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:20,320
Why don't you tell it to the court.  You're
under arrest.

84
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:21,970
Arrest?  For what?

85
00:10:21,970 --> 00:10:24,020
A traffic violation?

86
00:10:24,020 --> 00:10:27,160
What about this?
Looking for some action here?

87
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:30,480
If I were looking for some action,

88
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:34,340
you wouldn't be standing before me as you do right now.

89
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:35,460
Yeah?

90
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:38,900
That's cause I'd be shooting you with this!

91
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:53,400
Are you kids done yet?

92
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:58,380
I say we take him in and book him right now.

93
00:10:58,380 --> 00:11:02,820
You know my lawyers will have me out even before you get me to the police station.

94
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:06,700
The time is not worth your effort, now is it Cromwell.

95
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:10,340
Let him go.

96
00:11:10,340 --> 00:11:11,220
What?!

97
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:13,400
I said let him go.

98
00:11:14,780 --> 00:11:16,699
Uh, my gun please.

99
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:19,819
Nice...

100
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:22,580
You know, Vagan, you're right.

101
00:11:22,580 --> 00:11:24,380
You're not worth my time.

102
00:11:24,380 --> 00:11:28,900
However, investigating the multiple
homicides in your warehouse is.

103
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:35,100
And whatever else we find in your warehouse,
is just icing on the cake.

104
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:36,780
You're free to go.

105
00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:39,880
And by the way, your car's parked illegally.

106
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:43,200
You better get it out of here before we tow it.

107
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:46,099
Oh, and Vagan.

108
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:47,820
Here.

109
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:58,300
It looks like I'm not the only one after your boss.

110
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:28,819
...possible suspects. Rumors have surfaced saying that there is a vigilante bean in town...

111
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:55,740
What the hell is going on out there?!

112
00:12:58,780 --> 00:13:02,800
Ah.  Looks like I got someone's attention.

113
00:13:44,140 --> 00:13:46,680
Who's this?

114
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:09,219
Great.

115
00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:11,760
Playtime's over.

116
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:16,040
'Encrypted Call'

117
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:22,520
'Decoding'

118
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:23,880
'Secure Connection'

119
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:27,460
This is Killer Bean.

120
00:14:27,460 --> 00:14:32,060
Killer Bean.  What the hell are you doing? You think this is a game?

121
00:14:32,060 --> 00:14:34,140
What were you thinking last night?

122
00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:36,439
I had a rough night last night.

123
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:41,020
We know what kind of night you had.  Might I remind you what your mission is.

124
00:14:41,020 --> 00:14:46,640
You were given specific orders to hunt down and eliminate the target.  No one else!

125
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:52,420
Drawing this kind of attention to yourself is dangerous for us, and especially for you.

126
00:14:52,420 --> 00:14:55,979
What's the big deal?  I killed a bunch of
gangsters.

127
00:14:55,980 --> 00:14:59,200
I'm sure the Beantown police are a lot
happier without them.

128
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:02,880
You didn't do anyone a favor with that mess you created last night.

129
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:05,560
And you are not working for the Beantown police.

130
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:07,760
You are working for us!

131
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:10,060
I'll still get the job done.

132
00:15:10,060 --> 00:15:11,560
I'll get him.

133
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:14,880
We're running out of time.  He has to know you're coming by now.

134
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:16,939
Remember who he is.

135
00:15:16,940 --> 00:15:19,580
Yeah.  I know what the mission is.

136
00:15:19,580 --> 00:15:23,680
Then stick to it!  Don't be so reckless, Killer Bean.

137
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:26,079
I'll call you when I got him!

138
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:27,760
Reckless!  Pff!

139
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:30,660
Reckless my brown bean ass!

140
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:07,440
'Decoding'

141
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:08,800
'Secure Connection'

142
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:11,920
Yes?

143
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:16,060
Jet Bean, you have been activated for an urgent mission in Beantown.

144
00:16:16,060 --> 00:16:20,520
Beantown? I'm a long way from Beantown.

145
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:23,780
It would be best to assign someone else.

146
00:16:23,780 --> 00:16:25,959
This mission is highly sensitive.

147
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:28,800
You are the most capable for the job.

148
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:33,000
It figures.

149
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:35,100
Fine.

150
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:36,480
I'll do it.

151
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:41,280
Good.  We'll contact you with the details
as soon as you reach the shore.

152
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:43,660
See you in Beantown.

153
00:16:44,980 --> 00:16:49,380
They better have some good food in Beantown.

154
00:16:50,340 --> 00:16:51,640
Wait.

155
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:53,580
Are you leaving?

156
00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:56,100
Yes.

157
00:16:56,780 --> 00:17:00,040
How long will you go for?

158
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:02,680
A long time.

159
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:04,319
Oh...

160
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:09,120
I have something I want to give to you.

161
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:11,760
Oh... You shouldn't have.

162
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:15,260
Here!  It's the bill!

163
00:17:15,260 --> 00:17:18,200
You haven't paid in three months!

164
00:17:19,319 --> 00:17:21,339
I'm leaving now.

165
00:17:21,339 --> 00:17:24,839
I will pay when I get back.

166
00:17:25,319 --> 00:17:28,560
Hey! You get back here pay now!

167
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:29,639
Tsingtao!

168
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:30,840
Get out here!

169
00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:35,120
He say your food tastes like ass crack.

170
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:35,959
What?!

171
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:38,360
Make bean curd out of him!

172
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:53,160
I said I'll pay when I get back!

173
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:55,300
Oh.  It's okay.

174
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:59,320
It's on the house.  You don't have to come
back!  Please!

175
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:11,940
Looking at the figures from our previous fiscal year.

176
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:16,800
Narcotic sales have dropped 57 percent.

177
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:19,940
57 percent!

178
00:18:19,940 --> 00:18:21,840
That's more than half!

179
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:25,980
Now, compare this to the 300 percent growth

180
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:28,140
from our weapons department.

181
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:30,380
But you guys...

182
00:18:30,380 --> 00:18:35,040
You guys are not from my weapons department, are you.

183
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:36,440
No...

184
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:41,460
You guys are from my narcotics department, okay?!

185
00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:43,380
So what do I have to do, huh?

186
00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:46,800
How can I get through to you guys?!

187
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:50,780
Dude.  I have such a hangover.

188
00:18:50,780 --> 00:18:55,379
Yeah bean, that was a kick-ass party last night, right?

189
00:18:55,380 --> 00:18:58,940
Yeah.  Too bad we didn't stay
for the whole thing.

190
00:18:58,940 --> 00:19:01,940
I bet they had some fun.

191
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:03,640
Woot!  Woot!

192
00:19:05,260 --> 00:19:07,820
You see, it's easy when you think about it.

193
00:19:07,820 --> 00:19:11,320
Crime is on the rise, okay.  So more guns sell,

194
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:14,220
because criminals use guns.

195
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:15,880
Hello!!

196
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:18,000
They also use drugs!

197
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,640
So more drugs should sell, right?

198
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:23,140
What's the problem here?

199
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:25,240
Now, you guys.

200
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:29,640
Someone give me a reasonable explanation, okay?

201
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:35,580
Why are narcotic sales performing so poorly?

202
00:19:37,540 --> 00:19:40,780
It's all those anti-drug commercials on TV.

203
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:43,480
You never see any anti-gun commercials.

204
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:45,300
It's not fair.

205
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:49,680
It has become quite apparent to me,

206
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:53,880
that some of you do not value your job.

207
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:55,060
Now...

208
00:19:55,060 --> 00:19:57,679
That is quite odd, if you ask me.

209
00:19:57,680 --> 00:20:01,260
Especially in today's economy.

210
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:04,560
But I am forced to say...

211
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:06,020
It is time...

212
00:20:06,020 --> 00:20:07,340
To lay off!

213
00:20:07,340 --> 00:20:09,679
A few beans!!

214
00:20:11,140 --> 00:20:13,140
Ooohhh!!!

215
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:19,240
Uh, wait.

216
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:20,580
I have a question.

217
00:20:20,580 --> 00:20:21,740
Yes.

218
00:20:21,740 --> 00:20:25,300
Will I be eligible for unemployment?

219
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:26,500
Hmm.

220
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:30,520
Let me check with the finance department on that, okay?

221
00:20:31,380 --> 00:20:34,780
My social security number is...

222
00:20:34,780 --> 00:20:36,720
3, 4, 6...

223
00:20:37,940 --> 00:20:39,280
Oh boy.

224
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:42,820
Is my batting average going to go up after this.

225
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:45,159
Ahem-

226
00:20:45,620 --> 00:20:48,679
Hang on, let me just finish this level.

227
00:20:51,060 --> 00:20:52,580
Cappuccino!

228
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:56,240
Ah.  Vagan.

229
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:57,960
I'm glad you're here.

230
00:20:57,960 --> 00:21:01,340
Maybe you can teach these beans something about business,

231
00:21:01,340 --> 00:21:05,100
since you've handled my weapons department so well.

232
00:21:08,420 --> 00:21:11,420
That bean is nothing but a kiss-ass
brown-noser.

233
00:21:11,420 --> 00:21:13,760
What does he know that we don't know?

234
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:17,060
But he's making millions of dollars selling weapons.

235
00:21:17,060 --> 00:21:18,560
If you ask me,

236
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:20,980
He's doing something illegal.

237
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:24,080
Oh, it's great to see you, Vagan.

238
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:26,080
But you'll have to excuse me.

239
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:29,060
I'm in an important meeting right now.

240
00:21:29,060 --> 00:21:33,379
This is more important.  It's about the warehouse on Baker Street.

241
00:21:33,380 --> 00:21:36,280
Oh that.  It's okay.  I know.

242
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:37,620
You know?

243
00:21:37,620 --> 00:21:41,439
Yeah.  My nephew was having a
party of there last night, okay?

244
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:44,120
No, it's not about the party.

245
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:45,300
Well.

246
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:47,220
It is.

247
00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:50,100
There was a hit on the warehouse.

248
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:52,480
Everyone is dead.

249
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:56,459
Who did this.

250
00:21:56,920 --> 00:22:02,740
I have reason to believe that it was done by a bean named, Killer Bean.

251
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:05,480
Killer Bean...

252
00:22:05,980 --> 00:22:08,120
One bean?

253
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:10,459
This is no ordinary bean.

254
00:22:10,460 --> 00:22:14,540
I've heard of him before. I know what he can do.

255
00:22:14,540 --> 00:22:16,820
Who the hell is he?

256
00:22:16,820 --> 00:22:18,460
Who sent him?

257
00:22:18,460 --> 00:22:20,260
Is it the Colombians?

258
00:22:20,260 --> 00:22:23,120
Is it the French trying to roast me?

259
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:25,820
It has to be one of your competitors.

260
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:27,820
Who ever it is,

261
00:22:27,820 --> 00:22:30,240
I want you to find him.

262
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:33,780
I want you to find him, and destroy him!

263
00:22:33,780 --> 00:22:36,340
Oh, believe me I will try.

264
00:22:36,340 --> 00:22:38,520
But first, we have Killer Bean to deal with.

265
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:42,160
He's somewhere out there, and he's coming
after you.

266
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:44,360
All right.

267
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:47,959
We need to consolidate all of our warehouses.

268
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:50,740
There's too many targets for him to attack.

269
00:22:50,740 --> 00:22:54,880
Move all our inventory to the central
warehouse on Main Street.

270
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:58,720
I want you to protect that place.

271
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:02,340
What about Killer Bean?  What do you want me to do?

272
00:23:02,340 --> 00:23:04,040
Oh nothing.

273
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:09,220
Just send him a box of chocolates, and tell him thanks for the memories.

274
00:23:09,220 --> 00:23:10,900
You idiot!

275
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:13,180
What do you think you should do?

276
00:23:13,180 --> 00:23:14,540
Kill him.

277
00:23:14,540 --> 00:23:17,760
Any way you can, by any means.

278
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:20,860
Put him in the ground!

279
00:23:20,860 --> 00:23:25,040
I'll need more beans.  Professional beans.

280
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:27,760
Put it on my credit card, okay.

281
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:29,480
Just do it!

282
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:31,040
Yes, sir.

283
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:34,980
Vagan.

284
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:40,180
Make sure you find out who sent him.

285
00:23:40,180 --> 00:23:43,640
There will be hell to pay.

286
00:24:04,580 --> 00:24:05,280
Hello.

287
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:07,540
Hey, Harry.  It's Detective Cromwell.

288
00:24:07,540 --> 00:24:08,659
Hey, Cromwell.

289
00:24:08,660 --> 00:24:10,320
Hey did you get the package I sent you?

290
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:12,980
Yeah, it's pretty wild stuff.

291
00:24:12,980 --> 00:24:15,640
Our crime lab is getting nowhere with this.

292
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:16,920
What do you make of it?

293
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:19,700
Well, the easy ones the tire tread sample.

294
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:24,800
I tested the residue you sent, and the tires are made from silicon steel fiber alloy.

295
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:30,680
It's only used on high-performance cars. It's
not unique, but it's hard to come by.

296
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:33,660
Hmm... What about the gold bullets?

297
00:24:33,660 --> 00:24:34,960
Now that.

298
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:39,740
In my 15 years with Special Forces, I've never seen gold used in any weapon.

299
00:24:39,740 --> 00:24:43,320
But for practical purposes gold is a very soft metal.

300
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:46,840
So the bullets expand and deform on high impact.

301
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:51,060
They make little holes on the way in and big holes on the way out.

302
00:24:51,060 --> 00:24:54,240
And they are much harder to match the ballistic signatures.

303
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:57,200
That makes them relatively untraceable.

304
00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:03,360
Yeah, that doesn't make sense if the bullet casings have his name on it.  And he left those everywhere.

305
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:07,240
Yeah.  Killer Bean.  Yeah, I
don't get that.

306
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:11,920
He must be one sick bean, like he wanted
to be found out.

307
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:15,520
Yeah, or he's bragging.  Or just plain careless.

308
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:22,200
This Killer Bean has to be working for someone to get that kind of financial backing.  You think he's a gun for hire?

309
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:26,480
Or he could be a vigilante.  That's the word on the street.

310
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:31,780
Either way, one thing's for sure.  He has his eyes set on Cappuccino.

311
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:35,120
Heh, well then you both have something in common.

312
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:39,400
Yeah.  If that's true,

313
00:25:39,940 --> 00:25:44,640
I have a hunch where this Killer Bean will show up next.

314
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:46,820
Hey, I gotta go.  See you, Harry.

315
00:25:46,820 --> 00:25:47,860
Later.

316
00:25:53,060 --> 00:25:57,480
'Suspected Cappuccino's Warehouses'

317
00:26:40,300 --> 00:26:45,000
Dramatic entrance...  Dramatic entrance...

318
00:27:06,420 --> 00:27:10,000
Well, that pretty much frees up my day.

319
00:28:59,420 --> 00:29:02,740
Time for some breakfast.

320
00:29:07,020 --> 00:29:11,200
'Shadow Bean, you are too late.'

321
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:22,520
Howdy.  What will it be?

322
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:24,540
Tequila and tonic.

323
00:29:24,540 --> 00:29:27,480
And, uh.  Turn up the TV.

324
00:29:29,540 --> 00:29:32,600
Detective Cromwell, concerning possible suspects,

325
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:38,959
rumors have surfaced that there is a vigilante bean in town, who is hunting down Cappuccino.

326
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:42,580
There is no evidence for your vigilante theory.  As far as I'm concerned,

327
00:29:42,580 --> 00:29:48,020
the suspect or suspects involved in these
homicides are no friends of the police.

328
00:29:48,020 --> 00:29:52,120
We will do what is necessary to bring them to justice.  Thank you.

329
00:29:53,140 --> 00:29:54,980
I don't think so.

330
00:29:54,980 --> 00:29:59,020
I'll have another.  And you can turn that crap off now.

331
00:31:30,940 --> 00:31:32,460
What can I get you?

332
00:31:32,460 --> 00:31:34,920
I'll have what he's having.

333
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:54,140
This is a rough part of town.  Do you always sit with your back to the entrance?

334
00:32:00,980 --> 00:32:03,860
Doesn't matter who comes in.

335
00:32:03,860 --> 00:32:08,240
Isn't it against police regulation to be drinking during the day?

336
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:12,340
I'm a detective.  Our regulations are a little different.

337
00:32:12,340 --> 00:32:14,860
How'd you know I was with the police?

338
00:32:14,860 --> 00:32:18,520
You know, you're much uglier in person.

339
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:19,680
Heh.

340
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:23,240
My name is Detective Cromwell.  And you are?

341
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:26,120
Jack.

342
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:28,340
Well, Jack...

343
00:32:28,340 --> 00:32:33,060
I guess you heard what happened this morning over at the warehouse on Baker Street.

344
00:32:33,060 --> 00:32:35,320
Yeah, I know about that.

345
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:38,740
Really.  Tell me what you know.

346
00:32:40,300 --> 00:32:42,360
Why don't we cut to the chase.

347
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:45,060
Why don't you tell me what you know.

348
00:32:45,060 --> 00:32:47,280
Oh, I know a lot.

349
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:50,420
I know the Baker Street warehouse is owned by Cappuccino.

350
00:32:50,420 --> 00:32:53,580
I know someone killed 12 beans in that warehouse last night.

351
00:32:53,580 --> 00:32:57,679
I know the killer drove a fancy car, and has fancy guns.

352
00:32:57,680 --> 00:33:03,280
I know that the warehouse across the street with the big hole in the window also belongs to Cappuccino.

353
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:08,520
I see this fancy car parked in front, and well, you don't look like you walked here.

354
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:10,340
So my guess is...

355
00:33:10,340 --> 00:33:12,959
This, belongs to you.

356
00:33:13,660 --> 00:33:16,840
Well it looks like you figured it all out.

357
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:18,320
Good job.

358
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:20,300
Another!

359
00:33:21,340 --> 00:33:25,740
It was easy.  You were just reckless.

360
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:34,920
The way I see it, you're the one who's being reckless.

361
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:42,840
You come out here looking for me by yourself.  You didn't bring anyone to back you up.  That's reckless.

362
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:50,460
Here's my backup.

363
00:34:04,700 --> 00:34:06,660
That's a nice gun.

364
00:34:06,660 --> 00:34:09,100
Wanna see mine!

365
00:34:17,300 --> 00:34:23,360
How can I see it, if you have it against the side of my head?

366
00:34:31,719 --> 00:34:33,239
Not bad.

367
00:34:33,239 --> 00:34:35,520
But mine's bigger.

368
00:34:39,139 --> 00:34:41,920
You do the math.

369
00:34:44,239 --> 00:34:46,739
Why are you after Cappuccino?

370
00:34:46,739 --> 00:34:50,639
That's for me to know, and you not to know.

371
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:55,560
Well, I know I can't have a crazy vigilante running around shooting up beans.

372
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:58,120
But you're no vigilante, are you.

373
00:34:58,120 --> 00:35:00,779
Seems like there are beans who've invested in you,

374
00:35:00,780 --> 00:35:04,180
And I'm sure they're not happy with the press you're getting.

375
00:35:04,180 --> 00:35:06,000
This is where I can help you.

376
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,820
I don't need help.

377
00:35:15,620 --> 00:35:18,980
Well, you see.  I'm bound by the law.

378
00:35:18,980 --> 00:35:23,220
I've been working this Cappuccino case for over three years.

379
00:35:23,220 --> 00:35:30,839
Every time we think we have something on him, his lawyers get in the way and get him out.

380
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:33,020
I wish I was like you.

381
00:35:33,020 --> 00:35:36,840
I wish I could just walk up to him and shoot him.

382
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:38,900
But I can't.

383
00:35:38,900 --> 00:35:40,180
It's too bad.

384
00:35:40,180 --> 00:35:43,020
Because I know where is central warehouse is.

385
00:35:43,020 --> 00:35:46,840
Not these abandoned warehouses, like that
one out there.

386
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:49,600
Why don't you pay him a visit?

387
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:53,880
You got the wrong bean.  I'm not just some hired gun.

388
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:56,040
Who says I'm hiring you?

389
00:35:56,040 --> 00:35:58,440
You already have a boss, don't you?

390
00:35:58,440 --> 00:36:02,600
I bet he doesn't really like all that attention that you're getting from the media.

391
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:04,640
I can make that go away.

392
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:06,319
I control the evidence,

393
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:11,840
and the evidence says it could've been some rival gang that killed all of Cappuccino's beans last night, or...

394
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:13,980
It could be you.

395
00:36:13,980 --> 00:36:17,460
And I have a lot of evidence that says that.

396
00:36:18,780 --> 00:36:21,380
Are you going to take me in?

397
00:36:21,380 --> 00:36:24,180
I can take you down.

398
00:36:24,180 --> 00:36:27,620
Oh... I would enjoy that.

399
00:36:37,100 --> 00:36:38,600
Freeze!

400
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:43,300
Get out of my bar you punks!  I know how to use this!

401
00:36:43,300 --> 00:36:45,920
Whoa!  Whoa!  Whoa!  Hold on! I'm a cop!

402
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:47,340
Put down your gun!

403
00:36:47,340 --> 00:36:48,800
I don't trust any of you.

404
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:50,820
You drop your guns, both of you!

405
00:36:50,820 --> 00:36:54,080
Sorry, grandpa.  It doesn't work like that.

406
00:37:15,700 --> 00:37:17,520
Okay, okay.

407
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:20,799
I'm going to slowly lower my gun,

408
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:23,840
and I'm gonna go, alright?  Alright?

409
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:26,460
This will be real easy.

410
00:37:38,540 --> 00:37:40,080
See?

411
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:42,420
This is easy.

412
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:47,520
Killer Bean.

413
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:49,660
Remember what I said.

414
00:37:49,660 --> 00:37:51,600
We can help each other.

415
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:54,600
Just help yourself out the door.

416
00:38:10,140 --> 00:38:13,700
This is for the drinks.  Mine and his.

417
00:38:13,700 --> 00:38:17,259
Now, you mind if I go to the bathroom before I go?

418
00:38:17,260 --> 00:38:19,980
Be quick.  Your life depends on it.

419
00:38:19,980 --> 00:38:22,500
So dramatic.

420
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:49,160
Sorry.  It was a double flusher.

421
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:56,980
But you only flushed once.

422
00:39:06,260 --> 00:39:09,840
Hey... Don't I know you from somewhere?

423
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:12,740
Who is Shadow Bean?

424
00:39:13,640 --> 00:39:16,400
You're in way over your head.

425
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:18,680
Who is Shadow Bean?!

426
00:39:18,680 --> 00:39:21,879
You don't have to yell.  I'm right next to you.

427
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:24,900
Answer me!  Are there two of you?!

428
00:39:25,900 --> 00:39:29,500
You're not going to shoot me if you need the answers.

429
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:36,420
Besides, I can't answer you anyway.  So...

430
00:39:36,420 --> 00:39:38,860
I'll have to do this instead!

431
00:39:52,100 --> 00:39:55,540
It's a good idea for you to stay down.

432
00:39:58,340 --> 00:40:00,900
We'll settle this later.

433
00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:04,780
You're not as dumb as you look.

434
00:40:20,380 --> 00:40:21,280
Hello.

435
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:23,560
Harry.  It's Cromwell.

436
00:40:23,560 --> 00:40:25,160
My hunch was right.

437
00:40:25,160 --> 00:40:28,420
Killer Bean hit Cappuccino's warehouse on
the east side.

438
00:40:28,420 --> 00:40:30,660
In fact, he was still here when I got here.

439
00:40:30,660 --> 00:40:32,640
Whoa, how did that go?

440
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:35,120
Not as well as I would have liked.

441
00:40:35,120 --> 00:40:40,700
Hey listen.  I got some new info. I found a note in front of Cappuccino's warehouse.

442
00:40:40,700 --> 00:40:44,140
It said, Shadow Bean, you are too late.

443
00:40:44,140 --> 00:40:46,700
Does that mean anything to you?

444
00:40:48,300 --> 00:40:50,700
Harry?  You still there?

445
00:40:50,700 --> 00:40:54,080
I didn't know they were still in operation.

446
00:40:54,080 --> 00:40:55,140
Who?

447
00:40:55,140 --> 00:40:57,660
The Shadow Beans.

448
00:40:57,660 --> 00:41:00,080
Harry, what's going on?

449
00:41:00,080 --> 00:41:06,220
They're highly trained operatives of an
organization called the Shadow Agency.

450
00:41:06,220 --> 00:41:12,180
Shadow Agency?  What are they, a government agency?  Why haven't I heard of them?

451
00:41:12,180 --> 00:41:14,859
I think they were a private organization.

452
00:41:14,860 --> 00:41:19,100
There are some things the government does that are not meant to be known.

453
00:41:19,100 --> 00:41:22,720
Their collaboration with the Shadow Agency was one of them.

454
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:25,459
When diplomatic and military tactics failed,

455
00:41:25,460 --> 00:41:30,940
our government hired the Shadow Agency to eliminate national security threats.

456
00:41:30,940 --> 00:41:36,140
It was more cost effective than training and maintaining our own elite assassins.

457
00:41:36,140 --> 00:41:40,259
And the Shadow Beans were better than anything we had.

458
00:41:40,260 --> 00:41:41,500
Great.

459
00:41:41,500 --> 00:41:43,120
But why here?

460
00:41:43,120 --> 00:41:45,620
What are the Shadow Beans doing in Beantown?

461
00:41:45,620 --> 00:41:48,700
And what could they possibly want with Cappuccino?

462
00:41:48,700 --> 00:41:53,540
I don't know.  I thought the Shadow Agency was disbanded.

463
00:41:53,540 --> 00:41:57,160
I know our government stopped using them nearly a decade ago.

464
00:41:57,160 --> 00:42:00,220
I haven't heard of them since.

465
00:42:00,220 --> 00:42:03,319
So do you think this Killer Bean is a Shadow Bean operative?

466
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:06,340
It sounds like he's certainly good enough to be.

467
00:42:06,340 --> 00:42:08,860
What do you think I should do is stop him?

468
00:42:08,860 --> 00:42:11,760
I don't even know if you can't stop him.

469
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:16,140
But you can start by putting all your cops on double duty.

470
00:42:16,140 --> 00:42:17,920
Right...

471
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:29,900
This is the place.

472
00:42:33,360 --> 00:42:36,220
Dramatic entrance.

473
00:42:37,540 --> 00:42:40,400
Bean, I hate this job.

474
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:43,060
It's so freaking boring.

475
00:42:43,060 --> 00:42:45,920
All we do we sit around and drink beer.

476
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:49,260
Are you kidding?  This is my dream job!

477
00:42:49,260 --> 00:42:52,300
Hey!  We're not supposed to be just
sitting around drinking beer.

478
00:42:52,300 --> 00:42:56,460
Remember what Vagan said?  He said we got to move all those crates by morning.

479
00:42:56,460 --> 00:42:59,140
If the cops find this stuff, we are screwed.

480
00:42:59,140 --> 00:43:01,299
Where are we supposed to move them?

481
00:43:01,300 --> 00:43:04,740
I don't know.  I didn't really listen to
that part.

482
00:43:04,740 --> 00:43:06,560
Hey, give me another beer.

483
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:10,480
Oh here, have mine.  I shouldn't drink anymore.

484
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:12,040
*sniff*

485
00:43:12,360 --> 00:43:13,760
*cough*

486
00:43:14,020 --> 00:43:16,160
I have a really bad cold.

487
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:18,120
All right!

488
00:43:18,120 --> 00:43:21,460
Wait... is this a low carb beer?

489
00:43:21,460 --> 00:43:23,400
Hey, speaking of beer...

490
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:26,340
Did you beans hear what happened at the party last night?

491
00:43:26,340 --> 00:43:28,940
Some dude went in there, and killed everyone.

492
00:43:28,940 --> 00:43:31,300
He even killed Cappuccino's nephew.

493
00:43:31,300 --> 00:43:32,560
Geez...

494
00:43:32,560 --> 00:43:35,000
Who was this bean that killed everyone?

495
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,060
Is he someone I should be worried about?

496
00:43:37,060 --> 00:43:41,500
Nah.  He's probably just some crazed lunatic, running around with lots of guns.

497
00:43:41,500 --> 00:43:43,680
You know, that's the problem with this country.

498
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:46,259
Too many crazed lunatics with guns.

499
00:43:46,260 --> 00:43:48,640
Isn't that right, baby?

500
00:43:49,980 --> 00:43:51,740
The lunatics aren't the problem.

501
00:43:51,740 --> 00:43:53,540
The real problem is the guns.

502
00:43:53,540 --> 00:43:56,779
What this country needs is some serious gun control.

503
00:43:56,780 --> 00:44:01,760
I mean, we need to take away all
the guns.  All of them!  And just get rid of them!

504
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:05,820
But not my gun.

505
00:44:23,620 --> 00:44:24,779
Ohhh!

506
00:44:24,780 --> 00:44:26,340
Ow!

507
00:44:33,120 --> 00:44:36,299
Bean, you dropped into the wrong place.

508
00:44:56,920 --> 00:45:00,700
Looks like what we got here is a standoff.

509
00:45:02,420 --> 00:45:04,040
Not really.

510
00:45:04,040 --> 00:45:05,700
Over there!

511
00:45:17,320 --> 00:45:19,040
Take cover!

512
00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:24,819
Call the boss!  Get some help!

513
00:45:30,740 --> 00:45:31,959
Hello.

514
00:45:31,960 --> 00:45:35,960
Vagan!  We're being attacked.  I think it's Killer Bean!

515
00:45:35,960 --> 00:45:37,820
How do you know?

516
00:45:37,820 --> 00:45:38,960
Well...

517
00:45:41,560 --> 00:45:43,720
He's killing everyone!

518
00:45:44,440 --> 00:45:48,160
We're sending the mercenaries.  Just hold tight.

519
00:46:04,640 --> 00:46:07,000
Keep firing!  Don't let up!

520
00:46:12,140 --> 00:46:13,319
Grenade!!

521
00:47:55,780 --> 00:47:59,240
I can see we came to the right place.

522
00:47:59,240 --> 00:48:02,560
You made short work of these beans.

523
00:48:03,840 --> 00:48:07,100
Don't expect the same fight from us.

524
00:48:07,100 --> 00:48:10,740
My squad has been with me through hell.

525
00:48:10,740 --> 00:48:15,160
I hand selected them myself from the Academy ten years ago.

526
00:48:15,160 --> 00:48:18,180
All of them graduated with top honors.

527
00:48:18,180 --> 00:48:21,379
I led these beans through three tours of duty,

528
00:48:21,380 --> 00:48:26,640
accumulating a total of 15 Medals of Honor, 11 Purple Hearts.

529
00:48:26,640 --> 00:48:30,379
Sure, we lost a few good beans...

530
00:48:30,380 --> 00:48:34,580
But you should see what we did to the other bloke.

531
00:48:45,420 --> 00:48:48,160
Well, then we went into business for ourselves.

532
00:48:48,160 --> 00:48:50,879
Escort detail for high-level dignitaries,

533
00:48:50,880 --> 00:48:55,960
Hostage extraction, corporate assassinations, preemptive surgical strikes,

534
00:48:55,960 --> 00:48:59,860
Or just plain search and destroy.

535
00:48:59,860 --> 00:49:05,040
Heck, we even robbed a few federal banks with business with slow.

536
00:49:05,040 --> 00:49:06,500
So...

537
00:49:06,500 --> 00:49:09,680
So this little shindig we got here...

538
00:49:09,680 --> 00:49:12,000
Oh, it's nothing.

539
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:15,620
It's just a walk in the park.

540
00:49:20,060 --> 00:49:22,520
Are you going to say something or what?

541
00:49:22,520 --> 00:49:23,520
Huh?

542
00:49:23,520 --> 00:49:27,540
Oh, I'm sorry.  I must have totally zoned out on you.

543
00:49:27,540 --> 00:49:31,740
Whoa, my eyes are starting to water.  Whoo!

544
00:49:31,740 --> 00:49:32,839
Sorry.

545
00:49:37,720 --> 00:49:42,580
Let's make one thing clear.  Last night
was a party.

546
00:49:42,580 --> 00:49:45,460
Tonight, I get to work!

547
00:51:26,280 --> 00:51:28,800
Decaffeinated.

548
00:52:31,160 --> 00:52:32,720
Oh well.

549
00:52:32,720 --> 00:52:35,339
It was worth a try.

550
00:52:36,420 --> 00:52:40,220
This is not a good idea.  We should kill him now.

551
00:52:40,220 --> 00:52:42,160
Patience, Vagan.

552
00:52:42,160 --> 00:52:43,960
I need answers.

553
00:52:43,960 --> 00:52:47,260
I need answers from him.

554
00:52:54,720 --> 00:52:56,520
He's awake.

555
00:53:04,800 --> 00:53:05,880
So.

556
00:53:05,880 --> 00:53:09,600
This is the great Killer Bean.

557
00:53:09,600 --> 00:53:11,440
Yeah.

558
00:53:13,420 --> 00:53:15,680
You attack my warehouses.

559
00:53:15,680 --> 00:53:18,859
You kill my beans.

560
00:53:18,860 --> 00:53:21,660
What do you want from me?!

561
00:53:21,660 --> 00:53:24,339
My guns would be nice.

562
00:53:28,660 --> 00:53:32,540
Better enjoy a while it lasts, tough guy.

563
00:53:32,540 --> 00:53:36,140
Tough words from a bean who is helpless.

564
00:53:36,740 --> 00:53:38,040
Ohhh...

565
00:53:38,040 --> 00:53:40,300
No, you did not!

566
00:53:45,900 --> 00:53:48,900
Okay.  Maybe you did.

567
00:53:48,900 --> 00:53:53,780
What do you want, Killer Bean?  Who are you working for?

568
00:53:53,780 --> 00:53:57,640
What.  You expect me to just blurt it all out?

569
00:53:57,640 --> 00:54:01,660
My nephew was at the Baker Street warehouse when you attacked it, okay.

570
00:54:01,660 --> 00:54:05,040
I think you owe me an explanation.

571
00:54:05,040 --> 00:54:06,720
Your nephew?

572
00:54:06,720 --> 00:54:09,839
Hmm... Your nephew...

573
00:54:09,840 --> 00:54:12,140
He was such a good boy.

574
00:54:12,140 --> 00:54:15,140
He wanted to be a DJ as some big nightclub.

575
00:54:15,140 --> 00:54:19,779
I told him, someday I'll buy you your own my club.

576
00:54:19,780 --> 00:54:22,540
As long as you sell my drugs there.

577
00:54:22,540 --> 00:54:26,080
Eh, the profit sharing we never agreed on.

578
00:54:26,080 --> 00:54:30,779
But you know, he was such a sweet kid.

579
00:54:30,780 --> 00:54:33,960
Oh yeah.  Yeah remember him.

580
00:54:33,960 --> 00:54:36,900
He was the one playing the music.

581
00:54:36,900 --> 00:54:40,320
He always loved his music.

582
00:54:40,320 --> 00:54:42,840
Well, he's dead now.

583
00:54:47,020 --> 00:54:50,560
Kill this bean.  He's wasting my time.

584
00:54:50,560 --> 00:54:52,740
It's about time.

585
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:56,560
How does it feel to be killed,

586
00:54:56,560 --> 00:54:58,540
by your own gun?

587
00:54:59,220 --> 00:55:01,020
Funny...

588
00:55:01,520 --> 00:55:04,940
I was about to ask you the same thing.

589
00:55:16,300 --> 00:55:20,240
Are we done playing games for today?

590
00:55:25,880 --> 00:55:27,620
Finally...

591
00:55:31,340 --> 00:55:32,420
Dispatch.

592
00:55:32,420 --> 00:55:33,980
This is Cromwell.

593
00:55:33,980 --> 00:55:35,720
Roger, Detective Cromwell.

594
00:55:35,720 --> 00:55:38,939
I need backup.  I'm at 43rd and Main Street.

595
00:55:38,940 --> 00:55:40,380
Right away, sir.

596
00:55:40,380 --> 00:55:42,000
There's no rush.

597
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:44,020
I got time.

598
00:55:44,020 --> 00:55:46,259
Cromwell out.

599
00:55:53,620 --> 00:55:55,020
How dare you!

600
00:55:55,020 --> 00:55:59,460
How dare you come onto my property, looking to kill me!

601
00:55:59,460 --> 00:56:02,040
Who do you think you are?

602
00:56:02,040 --> 00:56:04,540
Hate to burst your bubble, Cappuccino...

603
00:56:04,540 --> 00:56:06,980
but I'm not here to kill you.

604
00:56:06,980 --> 00:56:08,400
What?

605
00:56:08,400 --> 00:56:11,700
I'm here to kill him.

606
00:56:12,900 --> 00:56:15,440
You just got in my way.

607
00:56:15,440 --> 00:56:17,520
I don't understand.

608
00:56:17,520 --> 00:56:19,220
You want to kill him?

609
00:56:19,220 --> 00:56:20,779
Not me?

610
00:56:20,780 --> 00:56:22,960
What the hell is going on?

611
00:56:22,960 --> 00:56:25,120
Just shoot him already.

612
00:56:25,120 --> 00:56:27,160
It's complicated.

613
00:56:27,160 --> 00:56:29,359
Why don't you just beat it.

614
00:56:29,360 --> 00:56:33,780
No.  I'm quite interested to knowing why.

615
00:56:33,780 --> 00:56:36,380
Fine.  You wanna die to?

616
00:56:36,380 --> 00:56:39,800
Believe me, it's no trouble at all.

617
00:56:40,720 --> 00:56:42,640
Actually, uh...

618
00:56:42,640 --> 00:56:46,720
I think that my estimated taxes are due soon.

619
00:56:46,720 --> 00:56:49,560
I like to stay on top of that stuff.

620
00:56:49,560 --> 00:56:51,580
Good idea.

621
00:56:52,460 --> 00:56:53,440
Oh.

622
00:56:53,440 --> 00:56:54,520
By the way.

623
00:56:54,520 --> 00:56:56,060
Vagan?

624
00:56:56,060 --> 00:56:57,779
You're fired!!

625
00:57:12,400 --> 00:57:16,800
It's about time they sent someone with
some talent after me.

626
00:57:16,800 --> 00:57:20,460
Nothing but the best for you, Dark Bean.

627
00:57:20,460 --> 00:57:25,320
Yeah.  I guess they finally learned it's gonna take the best.

628
00:57:25,320 --> 00:57:28,200
What the hell is going on?

629
00:57:30,800 --> 00:57:33,920
You were one of the Shadow Agency's top beans.

630
00:57:33,920 --> 00:57:35,720
I used to look up to you.

631
00:57:35,720 --> 00:57:37,779
Now I have to kill you.

632
00:57:37,780 --> 00:57:40,120
Why did you betray us, Dark Bean?

633
00:57:40,120 --> 00:57:42,440
I didn't betray anyone.

634
00:57:42,440 --> 00:57:45,100
The Shadow Agency betrayed me.

635
00:57:45,100 --> 00:57:46,360
What?

636
00:57:46,360 --> 00:57:52,120
You're the one who destroyed our database, and stole years of intelligence work.  How could you do that?

637
00:57:52,120 --> 00:57:58,500
And how could you go from policing the world to running guns for this two-bit gangster?

638
00:57:58,500 --> 00:58:02,320
Why did you join the Shadow Agency, Killer Bean?

639
00:58:02,320 --> 00:58:07,840
To get rid of the trash in this world, one bullet at a time.

640
00:58:08,800 --> 00:58:12,260
Yeah, we all joined for the same reason.

641
00:58:12,260 --> 00:58:15,800
But when I joined the Shadow Agency 12 years ago,

642
00:58:15,800 --> 00:58:17,960
It was more clear cut.

643
00:58:17,960 --> 00:58:23,560
Our job was to neutralize threats, while the politicians were paralyzed in diplomatic bullshit.

644
00:58:23,560 --> 00:58:26,220
That's just the way I like it.

645
00:58:26,220 --> 00:58:28,200
Times have changed.

646
00:58:28,200 --> 00:58:30,819
The agency was always privately controlled,

647
00:58:30,820 --> 00:58:34,980
But originally we always worked with the government to protect our citizens.

648
00:58:34,980 --> 00:58:37,140
Then it all changed.

649
00:58:37,140 --> 00:58:40,279
I'm not sure what caused the shift but now,

650
00:58:40,280 --> 00:58:44,800
we're just guns for hire, providing services to the highest bidder.

651
00:58:44,800 --> 00:58:49,240
Anyone with the right amount of money can buy the talents of the Shadow Beans.

652
00:58:49,240 --> 00:58:52,560
On one mission, I was asked to protect some rich dictator.

653
00:58:52,560 --> 00:58:56,180
On another, I assassinated an opposing leader.

654
00:58:56,180 --> 00:58:58,040
It didn't matter what we did.

655
00:58:58,040 --> 00:59:03,060
The Shadow Agency always convinced us that what we did was for the right reasons.

656
00:59:03,060 --> 00:59:10,700
But before I left, they had me deliver weapons to the very group of beans I had spent several years trying to take down.

657
00:59:10,700 --> 00:59:13,100
That was it for me.

658
00:59:14,300 --> 00:59:16,740
Do you expect me to believe any of this?

659
00:59:16,740 --> 00:59:22,299
All I know is that you breached the agency's security, and stole years of intelligence work.

660
00:59:22,300 --> 00:59:24,340
I didn't steal anything.

661
00:59:24,340 --> 00:59:26,900
All the information I took was mine.

662
00:59:26,900 --> 00:59:33,180
I wasn't about to give up 12 years of sweat and blood.  I needed it to continue my work.

663
00:59:33,180 --> 00:59:38,080
And exactly how does serving Cappuccino continue your work?

664
00:59:38,080 --> 00:59:41,620
Cappuccino is a major player in the weapons market.

665
00:59:41,620 --> 00:59:44,680
Posing as his lackey puts me on the inside.

666
00:59:44,680 --> 00:59:50,560
I can find out who wants what, who sells
what, and where the big threats are.

667
00:59:50,560 --> 00:59:58,920
But unlike at the Shadow Agency, I can finally kill the beans who deserve to be killed.

668
01:00:01,180 --> 01:00:05,299
You got yourself a few more minutes of
life with that story, Dark Bean.

669
01:00:05,300 --> 01:00:08,620
But you can't out talk my trigger finger.

670
01:00:08,620 --> 01:00:11,160
It doesn't matter if you believe me or not.

671
01:00:11,160 --> 01:00:13,160
This is probably your last mission.

672
01:00:13,160 --> 01:00:17,000
If I don't kill you, the Shadow Agency will.

673
01:00:18,020 --> 01:00:22,620
What the hell are you talking about?  I'm
one of their best Shadow Beans.

674
01:00:22,620 --> 01:00:24,759
Why would they want me dead?

675
01:00:24,760 --> 01:00:27,500
The Shadow Agency knows I could expose them.

676
01:00:27,500 --> 01:00:31,160
Any agent that comes in contact with me is compromised.

677
01:00:31,160 --> 01:00:32,879
And from what I've been hearing,

678
01:00:32,880 --> 01:00:36,980
You've been a liability to the agency since the day you started.

679
01:00:36,980 --> 01:00:42,680
Seeing the mess you made last night confirms that the Shadow Agency has a hard time controlling you.

680
01:00:42,680 --> 01:00:46,040
They must know you joined for the same
reasons I did.

681
01:00:46,040 --> 01:00:50,340
They know it's only a matter of time
before you find out the truth about them.

682
01:00:50,340 --> 01:00:55,440
And if they can't control you now, how
will they control you when you do find out?

683
01:00:55,440 --> 01:01:01,520
It's smarter for them to diffuse you
now, before you become a bigger problem.

684
01:01:02,280 --> 01:01:06,440
If they wanted me dead, then why even
send me on this mission?

685
01:01:06,440 --> 01:01:10,380
You said it yourself.  You're one of their best.

686
01:01:10,380 --> 01:01:14,900
They tried to kill me before.  They sent Shadow Beans after me twice.

687
01:01:14,900 --> 01:01:17,420
They both failed.

688
01:01:17,420 --> 01:01:20,040
Think about it, Killer Bean.

689
01:01:20,040 --> 01:01:24,660
They want us both dead, and we're hard to kill.

690
01:01:24,660 --> 01:01:29,799
Regardless of the outcome of this mission, the agency gets what they want.

691
01:01:29,800 --> 01:01:33,540
Because one of us will be eliminated.

692
01:01:35,460 --> 01:01:37,520
No, no.  You're lying.

693
01:01:37,520 --> 01:01:41,580
I'm not gonna believe you.  I won't believe a word you say.

694
01:02:27,820 --> 01:02:30,940
I had to take the shot.

695
01:02:30,940 --> 01:02:35,420
I would have done more with my life than you ever will.

696
01:02:35,420 --> 01:02:37,940
Doesn't matter now.

697
01:02:38,660 --> 01:02:42,060
We're both dead beans.

698
01:03:06,020 --> 01:03:07,080
Dispatch.

699
01:03:07,080 --> 01:03:09,500
This is Cromwell.  Where's my backup?

700
01:03:09,500 --> 01:03:13,660
6 squad cars eta 3 minutes, 2 special assault units in 5.

701
01:03:13,660 --> 01:03:15,100
Get me more.

702
01:03:15,100 --> 01:03:17,279
How many, sir?

703
01:03:17,280 --> 01:03:19,200
Everyone.

704
01:03:38,620 --> 01:03:40,180
Yes?

705
01:03:47,540 --> 01:03:50,259
Yes, I am here.

706
01:03:58,940 --> 01:04:01,800
'Deactivated'

707
01:04:06,760 --> 01:04:09,960
And who is the target?

708
01:04:13,640 --> 01:04:16,759
'Deactivated'

709
01:04:27,680 --> 01:04:30,279
No.  No problem at all.

710
01:04:30,280 --> 01:04:33,200
I've always wanted to meet him.

711
01:04:33,200 --> 01:04:37,140
I'll call you when the job is done.

712
01:04:37,140 --> 01:04:38,359
'Secure Connection'

713
01:06:09,520 --> 01:06:11,060
Drop your guns!

714
01:06:11,060 --> 01:06:12,820
Put em down, now!

715
01:06:13,360 --> 01:06:15,680
It's not gonna end like this.

716
01:06:16,400 --> 01:06:18,720
Drop your guns!

717
01:06:26,720 --> 01:06:30,520
Whoa, whoa ,whoa!  Easy, hold your fire!

718
01:06:33,380 --> 01:06:36,060
Finally brought some backup, huh.

719
01:06:36,060 --> 01:06:39,560
Yeah.  Does this satisfy your ego?

720
01:06:39,560 --> 01:06:43,660
What do you want, Cromwell?  Coming to see if I did your dirty work?

721
01:06:43,660 --> 01:06:46,240
He's right over there.

722
01:06:46,240 --> 01:06:48,080
Yeah, he's dead all right.

723
01:06:48,080 --> 01:06:49,860
But you didn't kill him.

724
01:06:49,860 --> 01:06:51,580
He did.

725
01:06:52,740 --> 01:06:54,180
What does it matter?

726
01:06:54,180 --> 01:06:58,759
You got the results you wanted.  Now just step aside and let me by.

727
01:06:58,760 --> 01:07:00,540
Let you by?

728
01:07:00,540 --> 01:07:02,660
You're the key to this whole mess.

729
01:07:02,660 --> 01:07:08,540
If I let you go, I'll never find out about the Shadow Agency, or the Shadow Beans.

730
01:07:08,540 --> 01:07:10,540
I can't help you.

731
01:07:10,540 --> 01:07:11,779
Why not?

732
01:07:11,780 --> 01:07:14,900
You are Shadow Bean, aren't you?

733
01:07:16,060 --> 01:07:18,600
Not anymore.

734
01:07:23,080 --> 01:07:25,900
They're coming after you, aren't they.

735
01:07:26,920 --> 01:07:29,740
Don't shoot!  Hold your fire!

736
01:07:35,560 --> 01:07:40,220
If you tell me what I need to know, I can protect you.

737
01:07:40,220 --> 01:07:43,120
I highly doubt that.

738
01:07:43,120 --> 01:07:45,880
I can at least give you a place to stay tonight.

739
01:07:45,880 --> 01:07:49,280
Let me help you, Killer Bean.

740
01:08:06,920 --> 01:08:11,000
There is nothing you can do that will help me.

741
01:08:50,319 --> 01:08:54,240
But I do need a quiet place to think.

742
01:09:20,359 --> 01:09:25,059
Not exactly what I had in mind, but this will do.

743
01:09:25,060 --> 01:09:28,940
Make yourself at home.  This will keep you safe for the night.

744
01:09:28,939 --> 01:09:32,259
Hell, it'll probably keep us safe too.

745
01:09:32,260 --> 01:09:35,140
I don't plan on staying long.

746
01:09:36,439 --> 01:09:41,019
I'll be back in the morning.  We have a
lot to talk about.

747
01:09:58,940 --> 01:10:03,559
Who were these guys?  I'd like to know where they get guns like this.

748
01:10:03,560 --> 01:10:08,300
Hey, don't touch that stuff.  You know better than that.  You're contaminating the evidence.

749
01:10:08,300 --> 01:10:12,260
I don't think we're going to have a shortage of evidence here.

750
01:10:30,100 --> 01:10:34,580
Whoa, hold it!  This is a crime scene.  No
one is allowed on the premises.

751
01:10:34,580 --> 01:10:38,559
Yeah.  Nobody ordered no egg foo yung here.

752
01:10:39,400 --> 01:10:42,580
Where is Killer Bean?

753
01:10:42,580 --> 01:10:45,680
Killer Bean?  We put his ass in the slammer.

754
01:10:45,680 --> 01:10:47,380
Wait.

755
01:10:47,380 --> 01:10:49,960
Who are you?

756
01:10:56,940 --> 01:10:59,799
Let me put it in a language you can understand.

757
01:10:59,800 --> 01:11:04,660
So sorry.  No chow mein here.  You deliver wrong place.

758
01:11:09,400 --> 01:11:12,940
Get your hands in the air!  Put them up, now!

759
01:11:22,700 --> 01:11:27,260
Now put your hands on your head, drop to
your knees.

760
01:12:18,380 --> 01:12:21,120
Commander.  Thanks for your help.

761
01:12:21,120 --> 01:12:24,160
I'm turning in for the night.  I'll be back in the morning.

762
01:12:24,160 --> 01:12:27,059
Right, sir.  We'll be here when you get back.

763
01:12:27,060 --> 01:12:28,640
Excellent.

764
01:12:41,680 --> 01:12:43,180
What do we got here?

765
01:12:43,180 --> 01:12:47,340
Just some punk bean
we caught assaulting an officer.

766
01:12:47,340 --> 01:12:50,460
Well he sure picked the wrong night to do that.

767
01:12:50,460 --> 01:12:52,300
Take him in.

768
01:13:29,020 --> 01:13:33,020
Hold it!  Another move, and we drop you!

769
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:46,920
Take him out!

770
01:15:20,060 --> 01:15:24,060
These are very nice guns.

771
01:15:43,200 --> 01:15:46,420
Are you sure you want to do that?

772
01:15:46,420 --> 01:15:50,240
You need them more than I do.

773
01:15:55,520 --> 01:15:58,900
So you're the bean they sent to kill me.

774
01:15:58,900 --> 01:16:00,820
Mmm hmm.

775
01:16:02,640 --> 01:16:04,500
Who are you?

776
01:16:04,500 --> 01:16:09,540
I am Jet Bean.
Assassin from the East.

777
01:16:10,780 --> 01:16:14,820
I completed my mission.  Why do they want me dead?

778
01:16:14,820 --> 01:16:17,799
They don't tell me why.

779
01:16:17,800 --> 01:16:20,500
And I don't ask.

780
01:16:21,240 --> 01:16:25,219
They decided to kill me the moment they sent
me on this mission, didn't they.

781
01:16:25,220 --> 01:16:27,520
That's what Dark Bean told me.

782
01:16:27,520 --> 01:16:32,280
The agency knew that once I found out the truth about them, they couldn't trust me.

783
01:16:32,280 --> 01:16:34,500
They were right.

784
01:16:35,460 --> 01:16:38,240
Save your breath, Killer Bean.

785
01:16:38,240 --> 01:16:40,660
You're going to need it.

786
01:16:40,660 --> 01:16:46,559
Don't you know what the Shadow Agency is?  Don't you realize how they're using us?

787
01:16:46,560 --> 01:16:50,460
I can see you've been brainwashed by Dark Bean.

788
01:16:50,460 --> 01:16:52,720
He was a fool.

789
01:16:52,720 --> 01:16:57,700
No one Shadow Bean can threaten the agency.

790
01:16:59,260 --> 01:17:02,140
But I'm no Shadow Bean.

791
01:17:15,340 --> 01:17:20,080
I certainly hope you trained harder than that.

792
01:17:58,040 --> 01:17:59,240
Well...

793
01:17:59,240 --> 01:18:02,420
At least you're in the fighting mood now.

794
01:21:11,280 --> 01:21:15,759
You have been a formidable opponent.

795
01:21:15,760 --> 01:21:20,340
I am sorry I have to end this game.

796
01:21:27,960 --> 01:21:31,620
You already tried that.

797
01:22:08,420 --> 01:22:10,200
It's over.

798
01:22:14,740 --> 01:22:18,480
Not for you.

799
01:23:05,780 --> 01:23:07,820
'Secure Connection'

800
01:23:13,400 --> 01:23:16,599
Jet Bean, is your mission complete?

801
01:23:16,600 --> 01:23:19,300
Jet Bean is dead.

802
01:23:20,280 --> 01:23:22,099
Killer Bean...

803
01:23:23,420 --> 01:23:26,520
I learned a lot about the Shadow Agency today.

804
01:23:26,520 --> 01:23:28,760
And it's not for me.

805
01:23:28,760 --> 01:23:30,460
I quit.

806
01:23:31,180 --> 01:23:35,580
Don't be rash.  Think about what
you are doing.

807
01:23:35,580 --> 01:23:39,200
Why don't you come in?  We can talk
things over.

808
01:23:39,200 --> 01:23:44,200
Oh, I'm coming in.  But it won't be for talking.

809
01:24:05,640 --> 01:24:07,560
This will do.
