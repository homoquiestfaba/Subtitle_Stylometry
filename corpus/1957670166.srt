1
00:00:04,037 --> 00:00:07,704
(dramatic electronic music)

2
00:00:19,538 --> 00:00:22,788
(light ethereal music)

3
00:00:32,367 --> 00:00:35,367
(light eerie music)

4
00:00:39,378 --> 00:00:40,277
(sliding door rattling)

5
00:00:40,278 --> 00:00:43,611
(sliding door slamming)

6
00:00:50,077 --> 00:00:53,256
(footsteps thudding)

7
00:00:53,257 --> 00:00:54,340
Here we go.

8
00:00:55,550 --> 00:00:56,779
What are you doing?

9
00:00:56,780 --> 00:00:57,919
We're gonna be late.

10
00:00:57,920 --> 00:00:58,899
Seven P's, honey:

11
00:00:58,900 --> 00:01:01,289
Proper prior planning prevents
piss poor performance.

12
00:01:01,290 --> 00:01:02,529
This isn't cool, Mom.

13
00:01:02,530 --> 00:01:03,816
No, it is not cool.

14
00:01:03,817 --> 00:01:05,469
But you know what is cool?

15
00:01:05,470 --> 00:01:06,699
Your game was delayed until 7:00.

16
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:08,100
You got three hours to kill.

17
00:01:09,190 --> 00:01:10,729
Why didn't you tell me?

18
00:01:10,730 --> 00:01:12,130
I literally just told you.

19
00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:14,793
Does dad know?

20
00:01:14,794 --> 00:01:16,163
No.

21
00:01:16,164 --> 00:01:18,493
I think he'll figure it out
when he gets to the field.

22
00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:20,759
That's messed up.

23
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:21,893
Totally messed up.

24
00:01:26,710 --> 00:01:30,119
Great, now I have more time to worry.

25
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:32,129
It's just a scrimmage, sweetheart.

26
00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:33,369
Yeah, but I'm supposed to be on my way

27
00:01:33,370 --> 00:01:37,179
to MVP stardom in college
like you were, so.

28
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:40,099
Yeah, well, I don't care
so much about the MVP stardom

29
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:42,159
as I do that free ride
so I don't have to pay

30
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:43,869
for that college tuition.
(Samantha chuckling)

31
00:01:43,870 --> 00:01:45,569
Speaking of, maybe you could help me

32
00:01:45,570 --> 00:01:47,195
with that financial aid application.

33
00:01:47,196 --> 00:01:48,699
(ominous music)

34
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:51,779
(water bottle thudding)

35
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:53,699
Sweetie, I was just joking
about the scholarship.

36
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:55,200
It's okay if you don't get it.

37
00:01:58,830 --> 00:02:02,099
Samantha, what is it?

38
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:03,100
Nothing.

39
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:05,380
Not nothing.

40
00:02:06,466 --> 00:02:08,459
I want you to talk about this.

41
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:09,549
I know.

42
00:02:09,550 --> 00:02:10,889
Whenever it is, you can say it.

43
00:02:10,890 --> 00:02:11,890
I know!

44
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:16,690
Is someone out there?

45
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:22,503
I don't see anything.

46
00:02:26,209 --> 00:02:27,904
Sweetheart-
- Don't touch me!

47
00:02:27,905 --> 00:02:31,216
(ominous music)

48
00:02:31,217 --> 00:02:34,743
You don't know how I
feel when I see its face.

49
00:02:37,308 --> 00:02:38,308
Whose face?

50
00:02:41,110 --> 00:02:42,110
Honey.

51
00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:45,330
Baby, I need you to keep talking to me.

52
00:02:46,570 --> 00:02:47,570
It's nothing.

53
00:02:48,331 --> 00:02:49,429
(Samantha stuttering)

54
00:02:49,430 --> 00:02:51,379
Nothing, it's...

55
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:52,633
I can't play tonight.

56
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:55,760
[Ally] Hey.

57
00:03:05,838 --> 00:03:06,838
Fuck off!

58
00:03:08,288 --> 00:03:09,635
(door slamming)

59
00:03:09,636 --> 00:03:12,136
(eerie music)

60
00:03:18,608 --> 00:03:21,691
(fountain trickling)

61
00:03:24,568 --> 00:03:25,400
(fist knocking)

62
00:03:25,401 --> 00:03:26,423
You got a game to play.

63
00:03:27,470 --> 00:03:29,609
(fist knocking)

64
00:03:29,610 --> 00:03:31,279
Sweetie, I'm trying to
respect your privacy,

65
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:32,380
but you're scaring me.

66
00:03:33,490 --> 00:03:34,589
I'm gonna assume you can't hear me

67
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:36,190
'cause you've got headphones on.

68
00:03:37,830 --> 00:03:40,497
(fist pounding)

69
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:43,661
Okay, I'm coming in.

70
00:03:43,662 --> 00:03:46,162
(eerie music)

71
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:53,580
(Ally crying)

72
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:56,720
Oh, my God.

73
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:58,988
(dramatic music)

74
00:03:58,989 --> 00:04:02,340
(Ally screaming)

75
00:04:02,341 --> 00:04:05,758
(intense dramatic music)

76
00:04:17,021 --> 00:04:19,771
(glass thudding)

77
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:23,663
(ice clinking)

78
00:04:27,219 --> 00:04:30,136
(liquor splashing)

79
00:04:39,899 --> 00:04:43,149
(light dramatic music)

80
00:05:03,668 --> 00:05:06,335
(door slamming)

81
00:05:07,928 --> 00:05:11,376
(keys jingling)

82
00:05:11,377 --> 00:05:13,960
(bag rustling)

83
00:05:41,496 --> 00:05:44,079
(somber music)

84
00:06:39,336 --> 00:06:41,836
(Ally crying)

85
00:06:51,076 --> 00:06:54,493
(somber music continues)

86
00:07:10,877 --> 00:07:13,956
(cabinet thudding)

87
00:07:13,957 --> 00:07:16,540
(ice clinking)

88
00:07:26,770 --> 00:07:29,119
[Ally's Boss] Ally, we're out of time.

89
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:31,969
I'm really sorry, but we have to move on.

90
00:07:31,970 --> 00:07:33,279
We're turning over your patients

91
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:34,943
to someone else in the practice.

92
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:37,820
We really did try to work with you here.

93
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:43,909
[Terry] Hey, Ally, it's Terry.

94
00:07:43,910 --> 00:07:45,509
I know a therapist.

95
00:07:45,510 --> 00:07:47,439
I know, I know, you're
probably rolling your eyes.

96
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:49,409
Why talk to another therapist?

97
00:07:49,410 --> 00:07:52,629
Trust me, it was a lifesaver
for my sister when dad died.

98
00:07:52,630 --> 00:07:54,209
And listen, I hope you don't mind,

99
00:07:54,210 --> 00:07:56,180
but I relayed your contact info, so-

100
00:07:56,181 --> 00:07:59,014
(machine beeping)

101
00:08:10,799 --> 00:08:13,799
(light eerie music)

102
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:18,457
(Ally sighs)

103
00:08:24,021 --> 00:08:25,938
It's not my time yet.

104
00:08:28,501 --> 00:08:30,047
(drawer thudding)

105
00:08:30,048 --> 00:08:32,965
(doorbell ringing)

106
00:08:49,369 --> 00:08:51,036
For the love of God.

107
00:09:01,370 --> 00:09:03,013
- (Ally gasps)
- Hi, Ally?

108
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:05,140
I'm Jan.

109
00:09:06,690 --> 00:09:08,399
I heard that you weren't doing very well,

110
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:11,269
so I felt that I should come by in person.

111
00:09:11,270 --> 00:09:12,539
Who are you?

112
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:13,890
[Jan] I'm a psychologist.

113
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:17,173
Oh, okay, yeah.

114
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:19,629
Yeah, Terry mentioned you.

115
00:09:19,630 --> 00:09:21,739
He said you were a lifesaver.

116
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:24,519
He didn't tell me you'd be so attentive.

117
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:26,539
[Jan] Since I'm here, I
would just like to make sure

118
00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:29,579
that you're not a danger to yourself.

119
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:30,980
And then, I'll be on my way.

120
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:33,723
Five minutes, that's all I need.

121
00:09:34,770 --> 00:09:35,770
[Ally] Sure, yeah.

122
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:41,690
[Jan] No parent should
ever have to bury her child.

123
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:51,229
I appreciate you coming,
it's a really lovely gesture.

124
00:09:51,230 --> 00:09:52,119
I don't need your help.

125
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:53,439
I'll be fine.

126
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:55,559
Humor me for a moment.

127
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:58,323
And then I'll walk out that
door and never bother you again.

128
00:09:59,650 --> 00:10:00,650
Sure.

129
00:10:03,460 --> 00:10:05,553
Would you like to see
your daughter again?

130
00:10:07,130 --> 00:10:10,253
Samantha, would you like to see her?

131
00:10:11,420 --> 00:10:13,320
Because I'm sure she wants to see you.

132
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:16,037
Why would you say that to me?

133
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:20,669
You want to know why, why she did it?

134
00:10:20,670 --> 00:10:21,913
It's perfectly natural.

135
00:10:23,670 --> 00:10:25,123
She can tell you herself.

136
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:29,129
I think it's time that you left.

137
00:10:29,130 --> 00:10:31,299
I am not going to beat around the bush.

138
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:33,929
As a therapist yourself, you
know there is a lot of bullshit

139
00:10:33,930 --> 00:10:34,930
in this business.

140
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:39,657
Just hear me out.

141
00:10:43,087 --> 00:10:45,504
(Ally sighs)

142
00:10:51,308 --> 00:10:54,141
(bottle thudding)

143
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:56,143
This works.

144
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:59,459
I know because I've done it.

145
00:10:59,460 --> 00:11:01,099
What is it?

146
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:02,100
It's tea.

147
00:11:03,610 --> 00:11:05,559
It's been brewed with a
hallucinogenetic flower

148
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:07,609
called Datura stramonium.

149
00:11:07,610 --> 00:11:09,939
[Ally] And you want me to drink that?

150
00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:10,940
Just a little bit.

151
00:11:14,607 --> 00:11:16,689
I wouldn't see Sam,
I'd see a hallucination.

152
00:11:16,690 --> 00:11:19,489
The psychedelic effects
are inconsequential.

153
00:11:19,490 --> 00:11:20,940
It's what happens afterwards.

154
00:11:22,050 --> 00:11:23,050
And what's that?

155
00:11:24,570 --> 00:11:25,993
I was in your shoes once.

156
00:11:27,510 --> 00:11:31,890
I drank the tea and
then I saw him, my boy.

157
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:38,103
My son who had been
murdered 20 years prior.

158
00:11:40,130 --> 00:11:42,763
You have no idea how good
it felt to hug him again.

159
00:11:46,180 --> 00:11:48,653
This is a way to know.

160
00:11:49,770 --> 00:11:52,913
To see what Samantha saw,
to feel what she felt.

161
00:11:55,900 --> 00:11:57,950
Are you ready to take that leap of faith?

162
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,900
Why would I believe any of this?

163
00:12:03,490 --> 00:12:05,140
Because you're still listening.

164
00:12:06,898 --> 00:12:09,898
(light eerie music)

165
00:12:12,830 --> 00:12:14,480
There's a door to the other side.

166
00:12:16,270 --> 00:12:17,343
This opens that door.

167
00:12:22,850 --> 00:12:25,350
Give me call when you're
ready to walk through it.

168
00:12:32,437 --> 00:12:34,925
(door slamming)

169
00:12:34,926 --> 00:12:38,759
(light eerie music continues)

170
00:13:21,912 --> 00:13:24,579
(Ally sniffing)

171
00:13:39,885 --> 00:13:42,468
(creepy music)

172
00:14:04,912 --> 00:14:07,829
(cabinet slamming)

173
00:14:08,849 --> 00:14:11,849
(light eerie music)

174
00:14:26,745 --> 00:14:29,578
(papers rustling)

175
00:14:34,313 --> 00:14:36,980
(book thudding)

176
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,833
(light eerie music continues)

177
00:14:54,846 --> 00:14:57,513
(ominous music)

178
00:15:43,229 --> 00:15:46,407
(suspenseful music)

179
00:15:46,408 --> 00:15:49,786
(Ally gasps)
(paint bottle thudding)

180
00:15:49,787 --> 00:15:52,287
(Ally scoffs)

181
00:16:03,687 --> 00:16:05,423
Do you believe in ghosts?

182
00:16:10,190 --> 00:16:11,363
That's an odd question.

183
00:16:13,679 --> 00:16:15,733
I think it's odd that
I don't know the answer.

184
00:16:17,780 --> 00:16:20,149
It's 95 degrees outside.

185
00:16:20,150 --> 00:16:22,609
This afternoon I saw a kid in a scarf,

186
00:16:22,610 --> 00:16:24,110
bundled up in winter clothing.

187
00:16:25,590 --> 00:16:27,067
I thought that was odd.

188
00:16:28,790 --> 00:16:30,290
No, I don't believe in ghosts.

189
00:16:36,947 --> 00:16:37,949
I saw a therapist today.

190
00:16:37,950 --> 00:16:39,750
She says she thinks she can help me.

191
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:41,920
Yeah?

192
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:44,400
You went outside?

193
00:16:45,184 --> 00:16:46,734
[Ally] Oh, no, she came here.

194
00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:48,834
Why?

195
00:16:48,835 --> 00:16:49,779
I don't know.

196
00:16:49,780 --> 00:16:52,003
She's unconventional I guess.

197
00:16:52,004 --> 00:16:53,087
I guess so.

198
00:16:55,170 --> 00:16:57,452
If she's not in our network
we can't afford her.

199
00:16:57,453 --> 00:16:59,573
Can you just humor me on this?

200
00:17:00,860 --> 00:17:02,999
It's just me working now.

201
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,500
I can't keep doing this alone.

202
00:17:06,940 --> 00:17:08,619
Well, we don't have a kid to
put through college anymore,

203
00:17:08,620 --> 00:17:09,911
so there's that.

204
00:17:09,912 --> 00:17:11,462
Is that supposed to be funny?

205
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:13,680
No.

206
00:17:15,690 --> 00:17:16,589
I don't know why I said that.

207
00:17:16,590 --> 00:17:17,590
I'm sorry.

208
00:17:18,820 --> 00:17:21,333
How many handles of vodka
are in that kitchen right now?

209
00:17:22,940 --> 00:17:24,190
Or pills in the bathroom?

210
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,199
Okay, you made your point.

211
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:30,200
Have I?

212
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:32,550
You want therapy?

213
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:35,146
Go outside.

214
00:17:35,147 --> 00:17:36,639
That's not fair.

215
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:39,029
You can't keep living in this house,

216
00:17:39,030 --> 00:17:40,809
hiding with her memory forever.

217
00:17:40,810 --> 00:17:42,670
How is this so easy for you?

218
00:17:42,671 --> 00:17:44,283
- (fist slamming)
- She's gone!

219
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:46,660
Okay?

220
00:17:47,890 --> 00:17:48,890
That's it.

221
00:17:54,890 --> 00:17:55,890
I'm sorry.

222
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:03,670
It's not easy for me.

223
00:18:18,060 --> 00:18:19,810
[Samantha] Okay, hey, future Sam.

224
00:18:20,690 --> 00:18:23,589
This is a recording on my song.

225
00:18:23,590 --> 00:18:25,090
Let's hope I don't mess it up.

226
00:18:26,373 --> 00:18:30,270
(light ukulele music)

227
00:18:30,271 --> 00:18:31,335
♪ You're in space ♪

228
00:18:31,336 --> 00:18:35,777
♪ But I don't know where ♪
(eerie music)

229
00:18:35,778 --> 00:18:38,778
(light eerie music)

230
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:55,213
(stairs creaking)

231
00:18:59,538 --> 00:19:01,454
[Ally] Samantha?

232
00:19:01,455 --> 00:19:05,288
(light eerie music continues)

233
00:19:17,964 --> 00:19:20,964
(suspenseful music)

234
00:19:24,444 --> 00:19:27,194
(dramatic music)

235
00:19:31,137 --> 00:19:32,709
- Now?
- There's someone outside

236
00:19:32,710 --> 00:19:33,710
in the backyard.

237
00:19:37,411 --> 00:19:38,243
I'm calling the police.

238
00:19:38,244 --> 00:19:39,919
Well, now, hang on a second.

239
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:41,099
Who's outside?

240
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:43,098
[Ally] Someone wearing a mask.

241
00:19:43,099 --> 00:19:46,099
(suspenseful music)

242
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:01,160
I see it.

243
00:20:01,990 --> 00:20:03,790
That's what's gonna take us to hell.

244
00:20:04,879 --> 00:20:06,442
What?

245
00:20:06,443 --> 00:20:08,102
Why would you say that?

246
00:20:08,103 --> 00:20:09,263
I don't see anything.

247
00:20:10,523 --> 00:20:11,963
Why would I say what?

248
00:20:11,964 --> 00:20:14,999
- About us going to hell?
- What?

249
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,000
I never said that.

250
00:20:17,610 --> 00:20:20,210
Jesus, Ally, it's like
you're on drugs or something.

251
00:20:22,239 --> 00:20:23,989
No, I'm just spooked, that's all.

252
00:20:26,431 --> 00:20:27,868
What are you doing?

253
00:20:27,869 --> 00:20:29,838
- I'm gonna call 911.
- No!

254
00:20:29,839 --> 00:20:31,039
If you call the cops
they'll be poking around

255
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:32,839
till 5:00 a.m. taking statements.

256
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:34,109
We both need our sleep.

257
00:20:34,110 --> 00:20:35,079
So, what, I'm supposed to just let

258
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:37,149
a crazy person roam around my backyard?

259
00:20:37,150 --> 00:20:38,249
No, it was nothing.

260
00:20:38,250 --> 00:20:40,279
I just thought I saw Sam go downstairs.

261
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:42,209
And then I thought I saw
her go in the backyard.

262
00:20:42,210 --> 00:20:43,613
You thought you saw Sam?

263
00:20:45,490 --> 00:20:47,469
Clearly my imagination
is playing tricks on me.

264
00:20:47,470 --> 00:20:48,470
I'm sorry.

265
00:20:50,392 --> 00:20:52,383
Did you see anyone
in the backyard or not?

266
00:20:53,370 --> 00:20:54,370
No.

267
00:20:58,250 --> 00:20:59,250
Where are you going?

268
00:21:00,450 --> 00:21:01,509
To take a look.

269
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:02,829
Why, why would you do that?

270
00:21:02,830 --> 00:21:06,113
To make sure everything's okay, for you.

271
00:21:12,711 --> 00:21:15,961
(light dramatic music)

272
00:21:28,595 --> 00:21:29,595
Well?

273
00:21:31,870 --> 00:21:33,883
Just your imagination like you thought.

274
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:36,899
Look, if it makes you feel any better,

275
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:38,309
I once thought I saw
something creeping around

276
00:21:38,310 --> 00:21:39,423
in the backyard too.

277
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:42,267
What was it?

278
00:21:42,268 --> 00:21:45,314
[Michael] I don't
know, the neighbor's cat.

279
00:21:45,315 --> 00:21:48,315
(light eerie music)

280
00:22:12,809 --> 00:22:17,809
(creepy music)
(ominous crackling)

281
00:22:26,549 --> 00:22:28,809
(phone ringing)

282
00:22:28,810 --> 00:22:29,919
[Jan] Hello?

283
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:31,289
You said that for me to know why

284
00:22:31,290 --> 00:22:32,990
I'd need to see what Samantha saw?

285
00:22:33,890 --> 00:22:36,103
[Jan] It's good to hear
from you again, Ally.

286
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:39,140
[Ally] It is possible...

287
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:42,109
Did she tell you that?

288
00:22:42,110 --> 00:22:44,129
That I needed to see these things?

289
00:22:44,130 --> 00:22:45,619
[Jan] Communicating with the other side

290
00:22:45,620 --> 00:22:48,269
isn't as simple as picking up a phone.

291
00:22:48,270 --> 00:22:51,113
We need to figure out what
Samantha is trying to say.

292
00:22:52,922 --> 00:22:55,243
[Ally] Is it possible I'm
already seeing what she saw?

293
00:22:56,570 --> 00:22:58,104
[Jan] Are you?

294
00:22:58,105 --> 00:22:59,105
What did you see?

295
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:02,160
I saw...

296
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:05,960
[Jan] Ally, did you drink the tea?

297
00:23:08,050 --> 00:23:09,050
I took a sip.

298
00:23:09,770 --> 00:23:11,273
[Jan] What did you see?

299
00:23:14,420 --> 00:23:16,893
[Ally] I saw someone in
the backyard watching me.

300
00:23:17,850 --> 00:23:19,879
And I know it's the same
thing that Samantha saw

301
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:22,239
because she drew a picture of it.

302
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:23,889
[Jan] You took the leap.

303
00:23:23,890 --> 00:23:26,293
Samantha is already trying to communicate.

304
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:31,313
[Ally] So, what do I do now?

305
00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:33,799
[Jan] Talk to me.

306
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:35,429
We have a few chats.

307
00:23:35,430 --> 00:23:36,593
I'll help you find her.

308
00:23:41,601 --> 00:23:43,416
(Ally sighs)

309
00:23:43,417 --> 00:23:44,899
I don't know if we can afford that.

310
00:23:44,900 --> 00:23:47,559
[Jan] You don't need
to worry about that.

311
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:50,509
We'll try a couple of
sessions, no pressure.

312
00:23:50,510 --> 00:23:52,199
I'll come to you.

313
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:53,700
I know your current situation.

314
00:23:55,210 --> 00:23:59,483
It's best that you stay
inside, close to where she is;

315
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:01,320
Her energy.

316
00:24:04,550 --> 00:24:05,943
Why would you do that?

317
00:24:06,910 --> 00:24:09,010
[Jan] I saw your story in the newspaper.

318
00:24:10,090 --> 00:24:12,263
I sense so much sadness in you.

319
00:24:13,470 --> 00:24:14,829
This is what I do.

320
00:24:14,830 --> 00:24:15,830
This is who I am.

321
00:24:19,881 --> 00:24:21,397
[Ally] I don't know what to say.

322
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:24,010
[Jan] Say when to be there.

323
00:24:28,557 --> 00:24:30,019
[Ally] Hey, that
therapist I told you about,

324
00:24:30,020 --> 00:24:32,909
she's willing to come out
and do few sessions for free.

325
00:24:32,910 --> 00:24:34,349
Really?

326
00:24:34,350 --> 00:24:35,350
Why?

327
00:24:36,390 --> 00:24:37,809
[Ally] She wants to help.

328
00:24:37,810 --> 00:24:39,737
You know anything about her?

329
00:24:39,738 --> 00:24:42,079
[Ally] Terry recommended her.

330
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:43,366
Terry from work?

331
00:24:43,367 --> 00:24:45,009
Hm.

332
00:24:45,010 --> 00:24:45,842
You don't think it's weird,

333
00:24:45,843 --> 00:24:47,703
her coming out here and doing it for free?

334
00:24:49,727 --> 00:24:51,562
[Ally] I got a good feeling about her.

335
00:24:51,563 --> 00:24:53,829
(Michael chuckling)

336
00:24:53,830 --> 00:24:55,330
Why are you so high on this?

337
00:25:02,067 --> 00:25:05,003
(light dramatic music)

338
00:25:05,004 --> 00:25:05,836
(Ally sighs)

339
00:25:05,837 --> 00:25:10,837
Lately, I am having trouble
seeing a purpose in anything.

340
00:25:11,251 --> 00:25:13,362
Oh, babe, come on.

341
00:25:13,363 --> 00:25:16,829
(Ally sniffling)

342
00:25:16,830 --> 00:25:19,747
What about coaching softball again?

343
00:25:20,667 --> 00:25:22,529
What does that have to do with anything?

344
00:25:22,530 --> 00:25:24,979
I'm just saying, I
mean it might help you

345
00:25:24,980 --> 00:25:27,019
find your purpose again.

346
00:25:27,020 --> 00:25:29,283
No, no, like a valid purpose for me.

347
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:31,120
Nothing has purpose.

348
00:25:33,688 --> 00:25:36,273
What about all those cards
in there from your patients?

349
00:25:37,140 --> 00:25:38,440
Is there no purpose there?

350
00:25:40,230 --> 00:25:42,194
I can't help them anymore.

351
00:25:42,195 --> 00:25:44,445
- I'm a mess.
- Oh, come here.

352
00:25:46,804 --> 00:25:50,137
[Ally] I have no reason to be anymore.

353
00:25:54,548 --> 00:25:56,381
What are you saying?

354
00:25:58,904 --> 00:25:59,736
[Ally] Hm?

355
00:25:59,737 --> 00:26:01,257
Are you saying you'd rather be dead?

356
00:26:02,910 --> 00:26:03,910
No.

357
00:26:06,217 --> 00:26:07,217
Relax.

358
00:26:08,904 --> 00:26:11,306
I'm not (sniffling).

359
00:26:11,307 --> 00:26:13,193
I'm just being dramatic.

360
00:26:14,712 --> 00:26:15,862
I'm sorry to upset you.

361
00:26:18,050 --> 00:26:19,050
Ally.

362
00:26:22,430 --> 00:26:23,730
[Ally] So, what do I do?

363
00:26:25,330 --> 00:26:26,730
Strengthen the connection.

364
00:26:29,540 --> 00:26:30,890
Why do you want to see her?

365
00:26:33,780 --> 00:26:36,730
It's perfectly natural to want
to see our loved ones again.

366
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:40,339
You've shown me you'd do anything to share

367
00:26:40,340 --> 00:26:41,540
another moment with her.

368
00:26:44,670 --> 00:26:48,063
The way you live, torturing yourself.

369
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:51,453
Is that motivation driven by guilt?

370
00:26:52,410 --> 00:26:54,393
Do you feel somehow responsible?

371
00:26:58,563 --> 00:27:01,479
(Ally sighs)

372
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:02,580
She had mood swings.

373
00:27:03,810 --> 00:27:06,360
And at first I thought it
was normal teenage angst.

374
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:09,003
You talked to her about it?

375
00:27:10,487 --> 00:27:11,487
I tried.

376
00:27:13,170 --> 00:27:15,033
But it got bad really fast.

377
00:27:17,460 --> 00:27:21,373
In the last two weeks, she was really off.

378
00:27:23,010 --> 00:27:24,010
Up and down.

379
00:27:25,860 --> 00:27:30,503
And sometimes she was really scared.

380
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:34,350
I just wish I had done something
the first time I saw it.

381
00:27:37,780 --> 00:27:39,583
So, yeah, I do feel responsible.

382
00:27:40,839 --> 00:27:44,089
(light dramatic music)

383
00:27:47,571 --> 00:27:50,321
(shoes clicking)

384
00:27:54,579 --> 00:27:57,912
(sliding door rattling)

385
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:00,880
Why don't you leave the house?

386
00:28:02,554 --> 00:28:03,554
I can't.

387
00:28:05,430 --> 00:28:06,430
[Jan] Why?

388
00:28:11,070 --> 00:28:12,120
Because I'm scared.

389
00:28:17,140 --> 00:28:18,940
When I walk outside I can't breathe.

390
00:28:22,780 --> 00:28:26,519
The idea of doing normal
things like driving in a car

391
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:30,263
or going to a friend's barbecue,

392
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:37,560
working at a job, it's terrifying.

393
00:28:45,710 --> 00:28:48,460
(shoes clicking)

394
00:28:51,740 --> 00:28:53,240
Now we're getting somewhere.

395
00:28:55,020 --> 00:28:59,153
Everything you just said
is completely normal.

396
00:29:01,550 --> 00:29:03,353
(Ally sniffling)

397
00:29:03,354 --> 00:29:04,440
No, it's nuts.

398
00:29:06,490 --> 00:29:07,683
We are therapists.

399
00:29:08,870 --> 00:29:10,593
Nuts are our specialty.

400
00:29:14,490 --> 00:29:17,677
Samantha was an artist
and she kept a sketchbook.

401
00:29:17,678 --> 00:29:18,929
I think I mentioned it on the phone.

402
00:29:18,930 --> 00:29:22,462
I think she was drawing
pictures of the scary things

403
00:29:22,463 --> 00:29:24,160
that she was seeing.

404
00:29:25,207 --> 00:29:27,687
And I am seeing the same things.

405
00:29:29,898 --> 00:29:30,898
May I see?

406
00:29:32,242 --> 00:29:35,552
(creepy music)

407
00:29:35,553 --> 00:29:36,981
[Ally] This one.

408
00:29:36,982 --> 00:29:38,232
You saw this?

409
00:29:39,161 --> 00:29:43,174
Right out there just like it's drawn.

410
00:29:43,175 --> 00:29:45,925
(pages rustling)

411
00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:51,587
Freaky stuff, right?

412
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:54,529
You saw all of these?

413
00:29:54,530 --> 00:29:58,676
No, but the day Samantha
died she talked about a face,

414
00:29:58,677 --> 00:30:00,877
and it really scared the hell out of her.

415
00:30:02,870 --> 00:30:04,193
It's all very strange.

416
00:30:06,550 --> 00:30:10,413
Reminds me a story I heard, long ago.

417
00:30:12,019 --> 00:30:15,219
(timer dinging)

418
00:30:15,220 --> 00:30:16,270
That's all for today.

419
00:30:17,377 --> 00:30:20,377
(light eerie music)

420
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:24,063
Strengthen the connection.

421
00:30:28,057 --> 00:30:30,474
(Ally sighs)

422
00:30:31,610 --> 00:30:32,610
Talk to me, Sam.

423
00:30:35,390 --> 00:30:37,973
(Ally gulping)

424
00:30:40,989 --> 00:30:43,739
(pages rustling)

425
00:30:55,451 --> 00:30:56,785
(VCR whirring)

426
00:30:56,786 --> 00:30:59,536
(static buzzing)

427
00:31:00,810 --> 00:31:03,849
Someone made a mistake
and put this in my hand.

428
00:31:03,850 --> 00:31:05,130
[Michael] Get that outta here.

429
00:31:06,140 --> 00:31:09,369
[Ally] Show me your uh,
your beautiful artwork here.

430
00:31:09,370 --> 00:31:11,270
[Michael] Oh, you're a comedian, huh?

431
00:31:11,271 --> 00:31:12,659
- Dad!
- Hi, baby.

432
00:31:12,660 --> 00:31:14,612
- Hey.
- Be careful.

433
00:31:14,613 --> 00:31:16,129
- Look at how soft it is.
- (Ally giggling)

434
00:31:16,130 --> 00:31:18,620
She's so cute, I don't
know where she gets it from.

435
00:31:18,621 --> 00:31:20,179
[Ally] Aw.

436
00:31:20,180 --> 00:31:22,619
Ladies and gentlemen, what we have here

437
00:31:22,620 --> 00:31:25,659
is a grill full of hamburgers.

438
00:31:25,660 --> 00:31:27,333
There we go, that's
that famous Larkin wit.

439
00:31:27,334 --> 00:31:30,765
- Soon to be cheeseburgers.
- Mm.

440
00:31:30,766 --> 00:31:32,029
Be careful, you don't
want me to bust out my lines

441
00:31:32,030 --> 00:31:33,339
from the wedding now, do you?

442
00:31:33,340 --> 00:31:34,659
Oh, please.

443
00:31:34,660 --> 00:31:38,949
You know I love your "love
is baseball" metaphors.

444
00:31:38,950 --> 00:31:41,700
Blah (giggling)!

445
00:31:42,723 --> 00:31:43,555
Don't.

446
00:31:43,556 --> 00:31:44,879
Get the camera outta my face.

447
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:47,549
[Ally] Samantha, can you come over here?

448
00:31:47,550 --> 00:31:49,599
Can I take a video of you?

449
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:50,432
- Yeah.
- Come here.

450
00:31:50,433 --> 00:31:51,779
All right, pause right there.

451
00:31:51,780 --> 00:31:53,849
Can you say, "I'm four years old."

452
00:31:53,850 --> 00:31:55,464
I'm four years old.

453
00:31:55,465 --> 00:31:56,637
[Ally] And I'm almost a grownup.

454
00:31:56,638 --> 00:31:58,728
I'm almost a grownup.

455
00:31:58,729 --> 00:32:00,419
[Ally] And I can take care of myself.

456
00:32:00,420 --> 00:32:02,869
- I can take care of myself.
- (Ally giggling)

457
00:32:02,870 --> 00:32:04,424
That's good.

458
00:32:04,425 --> 00:32:09,425
(static buzzing)
(somber music)

459
00:32:33,598 --> 00:32:36,265
(ominous music)

460
00:32:37,932 --> 00:32:40,349
(Ally gasps)

461
00:32:41,386 --> 00:32:42,880
Hi.

462
00:32:42,881 --> 00:32:44,714
How'd you get in here?

463
00:32:47,887 --> 00:32:48,887
Are you lost?

464
00:32:52,162 --> 00:32:53,041
You're not in trouble.

465
00:32:53,042 --> 00:32:53,874
It's okay.

466
00:32:53,875 --> 00:32:55,893
I just need you to talk to me.

467
00:32:56,738 --> 00:32:59,004
(suspenseful music)
(Ally gasps)

468
00:32:59,005 --> 00:33:01,588
(Ally panting)

469
00:33:12,798 --> 00:33:15,298
(eerie music)

470
00:33:19,442 --> 00:33:22,192
(pages rustling)

471
00:33:38,297 --> 00:33:41,964
Were you watching home
movies in Sam's room?

472
00:33:42,850 --> 00:33:43,850
No.

473
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:45,760
Why?

474
00:33:46,540 --> 00:33:48,040
There was a tape in the VCR.

475
00:33:51,380 --> 00:33:52,930
So maybe she was watching it?

476
00:34:00,780 --> 00:34:04,559
There's nothing we could a done, right?

477
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:05,560
Right.

478
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:12,262
Must've been a warning sign.

479
00:34:12,263 --> 00:34:13,579
I just wish I had seen it.

480
00:34:13,580 --> 00:34:14,830
So maybe you missed it.

481
00:34:17,050 --> 00:34:18,600
Nothing we can do about it now.

482
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:23,063
So that means I'm terrible at my job.

483
00:34:24,309 --> 00:34:27,429
(Michael sighs)

484
00:34:27,430 --> 00:34:28,719
A little reassurance would be nice.

485
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:30,043
What do you want me to say?

486
00:34:31,430 --> 00:34:33,909
She saw things that weren't real.

487
00:34:33,910 --> 00:34:34,910
That's your fault?

488
00:34:36,298 --> 00:34:37,648
I should a done something.

489
00:34:38,621 --> 00:34:39,859
(cabinet thudding)
(light dramatic music)

490
00:34:39,860 --> 00:34:41,443
What about you the other night?

491
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:44,349
There's no purpose in anything.

492
00:34:44,350 --> 00:34:46,159
Is that a warning sign?

493
00:34:46,160 --> 00:34:47,679
Should I be doing something?

494
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:48,939
You think I'm ridiculous?

495
00:34:48,940 --> 00:34:51,019
No, no, I never said that.

496
00:34:51,020 --> 00:34:52,809
I told you years ago I
would never use that word

497
00:34:52,810 --> 00:34:54,359
to describe someone.

498
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:55,680
We're human beings.

499
00:34:55,681 --> 00:34:56,681
We do what we do.

500
00:34:58,979 --> 00:35:00,497
(Michael sighs)

501
00:35:00,498 --> 00:35:02,248
I don't know what to say sometimes.

502
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:05,320
You had a few words worth moments.

503
00:35:08,897 --> 00:35:11,597
Nah, I just think you like
my old cheese ball lines.

504
00:35:12,550 --> 00:35:15,209
Remember what you said
to me on our wedding day?

505
00:35:15,210 --> 00:35:16,210
Oh, yeah.

506
00:35:17,180 --> 00:35:20,949
Was it uh, "I've always
swung for the fences,

507
00:35:20,950 --> 00:35:23,357
but with you I actually connected."

508
00:35:24,224 --> 00:35:25,056
(both laughing)

509
00:35:25,057 --> 00:35:26,533
Wow, no stumping you.

510
00:35:28,557 --> 00:35:29,557
Yeah.

511
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:31,963
Never got that cabin.

512
00:35:33,510 --> 00:35:34,573
You have to remind me?

513
00:35:38,010 --> 00:35:39,223
Cool mountain air.

514
00:35:41,260 --> 00:35:43,610
We once said that was
the epitome of happiness.

515
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:50,103
(somber music)

516
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:53,350
Think it's too late for us?

517
00:35:55,551 --> 00:35:56,634
I hope not.

518
00:36:00,547 --> 00:36:03,214
(Michael sighs)

519
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:05,989
Remember that dance at our wedding?

520
00:36:05,990 --> 00:36:08,411
And I did this and this.

521
00:36:08,412 --> 00:36:10,819
(both laughing)

522
00:36:10,820 --> 00:36:13,487
[Ally] Good moves, Mr. Larkin.

523
00:36:14,660 --> 00:36:15,729
How much longer do you think

524
00:36:15,730 --> 00:36:17,243
he'll humor your reclusiveness?

525
00:36:19,213 --> 00:36:20,563
As long as it takes.

526
00:36:22,110 --> 00:36:23,610
[Jan] How long will that be?

527
00:36:24,451 --> 00:36:25,451
I don't know.

528
00:36:26,470 --> 00:36:29,423
But he's been very supportive
and he still cares.

529
00:36:31,140 --> 00:36:33,113
He goes to work everyday,

530
00:36:34,210 --> 00:36:36,810
takes on all the financial
burden without complaint.

531
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:39,680
[Ally] What are you trying to say?

532
00:36:40,896 --> 00:36:42,973
Are you sure he's at
work the whole time?

533
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:45,800
You think he's cheating on me?

534
00:36:47,264 --> 00:36:48,809
[Jan] It's just a thought.

535
00:36:48,810 --> 00:36:50,749
Here's a thought, Jan.

536
00:36:50,750 --> 00:36:52,500
Why don't you blow it out your ass?

537
00:36:55,096 --> 00:36:57,763
(both laughing)

538
00:36:59,220 --> 00:37:00,220
Touche.

539
00:37:02,970 --> 00:37:05,363
There's something I've been
wanting to talk to you about.

540
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:08,020
Samantha's sketchbook.

541
00:37:09,540 --> 00:37:10,540
Yeah.

542
00:37:11,496 --> 00:37:12,849
I was gonna actually bring that up.

543
00:37:12,850 --> 00:37:14,723
It seemed like it kind of upset you.

544
00:37:16,116 --> 00:37:17,816
I was hesitant to talk about it.

545
00:37:19,370 --> 00:37:20,883
I heard a ghost story once.

546
00:37:22,380 --> 00:37:25,639
About a scarred face with no eyes.

547
00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:26,866
You've heard the saying,

548
00:37:26,867 --> 00:37:29,702
"The eyes are the window to the soul?"

549
00:37:29,703 --> 00:37:30,953
[Ally] Mm hm.

550
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:35,203
Many years ago I was a
missionary in Botswana.

551
00:37:37,010 --> 00:37:40,219
The locals told us about the Ubuso.

552
00:37:40,220 --> 00:37:44,309
A malevolent shape shifting
spirit from an ancient world.

553
00:37:44,310 --> 00:37:48,189
On its own it was simply
the air you breathe,

554
00:37:48,190 --> 00:37:51,913
but to its victims it was
the embodiment of insanity.

555
00:37:53,220 --> 00:37:55,983
The Ubuso had no eyes in its true form.

556
00:37:56,890 --> 00:37:59,199
It would steal eyes from humans

557
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:02,159
and use their eyes to see into their soul.

558
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:04,843
To find their will to live and destroy it.

559
00:38:06,754 --> 00:38:08,879
The Ubuso fed on misery.

560
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:10,743
So, if it would see into your soul,

561
00:38:11,584 --> 00:38:15,633
it could see your fears,
your sadness, your pain.

562
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:18,637
How did they stop it?

563
00:38:20,636 --> 00:38:21,803
They didn't.

564
00:38:23,700 --> 00:38:27,309
In the Zulu language,
Ubuso means many faces.

565
00:38:27,310 --> 00:38:29,419
The spirit had the ability
to take on any form.

566
00:38:29,420 --> 00:38:31,209
That's how it got its name.

567
00:38:31,210 --> 00:38:34,393
Once it burrowed deep
into a person's psyche,

568
00:38:35,290 --> 00:38:36,963
it could manipulate reality.

569
00:38:38,490 --> 00:38:41,293
Once that happened, madness set in.

570
00:38:42,687 --> 00:38:43,687
And led to suicide.

571
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:46,629
The spirit was a parasite,

572
00:38:46,630 --> 00:38:49,783
so afterward it moved on to another.

573
00:38:51,567 --> 00:38:53,167
And this is what happened to Samantha?

574
00:38:54,315 --> 00:38:55,315
And me?

575
00:38:56,911 --> 00:39:00,593
No, it's just a story.

576
00:39:02,210 --> 00:39:04,413
The drawings are just a wild coincidence.

577
00:39:06,940 --> 00:39:08,703
So, why are you telling me this?

578
00:39:10,270 --> 00:39:13,443
Stories are created to
explain the unexplainable.

579
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:19,393
You want to know why.

580
00:39:21,250 --> 00:39:23,903
I believe Samantha is trying to show you.

581
00:39:27,193 --> 00:39:29,259
So I can understand
what she went through.

582
00:39:29,260 --> 00:39:30,260
[Jan] Yes.

583
00:39:31,860 --> 00:39:34,889
We need to continue to
build the connection.

584
00:39:34,890 --> 00:39:36,090
Keep drinking the tea.

585
00:39:37,530 --> 00:39:40,180
The door's already open,
you don't need to do that.

586
00:39:41,260 --> 00:39:43,253
You're not still drinking it are you?

587
00:39:51,910 --> 00:39:53,929
What I've seen, it's not just vision.

588
00:39:53,930 --> 00:39:55,680
It's trying to communicate with me.

589
00:39:57,020 --> 00:39:58,220
[Jan] How do you mean?

590
00:39:59,230 --> 00:40:02,919
I saw a boy in Samantha's room.

591
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:03,963
He had no mouth.

592
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:06,903
And I saw him in Samantha's sketchbook.

593
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:09,460
Samantha's breaking through.

594
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:16,407
He wrote on the wall,
"Give me your voice."

595
00:40:18,010 --> 00:40:19,453
So it's gotta be connected.

596
00:40:21,080 --> 00:40:22,273
Don't think so much.

597
00:40:24,010 --> 00:40:27,723
When you see Samantha,
it will all make sense.

598
00:40:29,080 --> 00:40:30,769
Seems like I'm gonna
have to see the face

599
00:40:30,770 --> 00:40:32,453
with no eyes before that happens.

600
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:35,070
Let's hope you don't.

601
00:40:39,120 --> 00:40:40,120
Hey.

602
00:40:42,210 --> 00:40:43,909
Can I talk to you about something?

603
00:40:43,910 --> 00:40:45,809
[Ally] Sure.

604
00:40:45,810 --> 00:40:46,810
Sit down.

605
00:40:56,860 --> 00:40:58,660
We were just kids when Sam was born.

606
00:40:59,630 --> 00:41:02,416
We talked about having another
baby when things settled down

607
00:41:02,417 --> 00:41:03,593
and we finished school.

608
00:41:05,110 --> 00:41:06,947
We never had that conversation.

609
00:41:08,100 --> 00:41:09,100
Yeah.

610
00:41:10,970 --> 00:41:11,970
Life happened.

611
00:41:14,350 --> 00:41:15,350
[Michael] Yeah.

612
00:41:16,390 --> 00:41:18,340
You wanna have that conversation now?

613
00:41:22,762 --> 00:41:24,209
Why?

614
00:41:24,210 --> 00:41:25,210
Why not?

615
00:41:26,303 --> 00:41:30,219
Why now?

616
00:41:30,220 --> 00:41:31,969
- You wanna replace Sam?
- No.

617
00:41:31,970 --> 00:41:35,439
No, no, baby, no, no, I did not say that.

618
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:37,883
Please don't put words in my mouth.

619
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:41,509
[Ally] So, why then?

620
00:41:41,510 --> 00:41:42,839
I'm just merely bringing up the fact

621
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:44,590
that we never had the conversation.

622
00:41:49,130 --> 00:41:51,829
- We're not ready for that.
- We're not ready?

623
00:41:51,830 --> 00:41:54,009
[Ally] Okay, I'm not ready.

624
00:41:54,010 --> 00:41:55,939
Don't do that, don't
blow me off every time

625
00:41:55,940 --> 00:41:58,399
I try to have a real
conversation about something.

626
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:00,449
You always storm off.

627
00:42:00,450 --> 00:42:02,219
It's ridiculous.

628
00:42:02,220 --> 00:42:03,159
I'm ridiculous?

629
00:42:03,160 --> 00:42:06,119
No, I said this is
ridiculous, this situation.

630
00:42:06,120 --> 00:42:08,770
I already told you I would
never call you ridiculous.

631
00:42:15,970 --> 00:42:19,220
(light dramatic music)

632
00:42:29,190 --> 00:42:30,607
[Samantha] Mom?

633
00:42:38,252 --> 00:42:41,169
(shower splashing)

634
00:42:50,113 --> 00:42:53,589
(door creaking)

635
00:42:53,590 --> 00:42:54,590
Hello?

636
00:42:58,930 --> 00:42:59,930
Samantha?

637
00:43:05,826 --> 00:43:08,493
(ominous music)

638
00:43:12,414 --> 00:43:15,414
Are you trying to tell me something?

639
00:43:18,190 --> 00:43:20,773
If you are, I don't understand.

640
00:43:25,494 --> 00:43:28,749
(dramatic music)

641
00:43:28,750 --> 00:43:32,635
(door slamming)
(Ally panting)

642
00:43:32,636 --> 00:43:34,137
[Samantha] Mom?

643
00:43:34,138 --> 00:43:36,713
(Ally panting)

644
00:43:36,714 --> 00:43:38,969
Why didn't you stop me?

645
00:43:38,970 --> 00:43:41,885
(suspenseful music)

646
00:43:41,886 --> 00:43:43,219
Look what I did.

647
00:43:44,250 --> 00:43:46,917
(ominous music)

648
00:43:48,067 --> 00:43:50,150
[Ally] This isn't real.

649
00:43:54,303 --> 00:43:56,803
(eerie music)

650
00:44:02,441 --> 00:44:04,985
(door creaking)

651
00:44:04,986 --> 00:44:07,569
(Ally panting)

652
00:44:09,495 --> 00:44:11,026
(suspenseful music)

653
00:44:11,027 --> 00:44:12,410
Come outside, Mom.

654
00:44:12,411 --> 00:44:14,411
The weather's fantastic.

655
00:44:16,755 --> 00:44:18,618
(Ally panting)

656
00:44:18,619 --> 00:44:23,619
(door slamming)
(fist pounding)

657
00:44:25,625 --> 00:44:28,602
(Ally panting)

658
00:44:28,603 --> 00:44:30,473
Healing is not without pain.

659
00:44:33,750 --> 00:44:35,319
We have to look at ourselves in the mirror

660
00:44:35,320 --> 00:44:36,423
and see the truth.

661
00:44:37,380 --> 00:44:38,369
I've seen plenty of things.

662
00:44:38,370 --> 00:44:40,199
There's no truth to any of it.

663
00:44:40,200 --> 00:44:41,850
[Jan] It's part of the process.

664
00:44:44,107 --> 00:44:45,878
I can barely will myself
out of bed every morning,

665
00:44:45,879 --> 00:44:48,669
and then you came along and
everything's the same except

666
00:44:48,670 --> 00:44:51,618
for now I don't know what's real.

667
00:44:51,619 --> 00:44:52,451
[Samantha] Mom?

668
00:44:52,452 --> 00:44:57,360
(creepy laughing)
(Ally gasps)

669
00:44:57,361 --> 00:44:58,839
(muffled whispers)

670
00:44:58,840 --> 00:44:59,840
Do you hear that?

671
00:45:02,260 --> 00:45:04,513
[Jan] You're still
drinking the tea aren't you?

672
00:45:05,401 --> 00:45:07,529
[Ally] I don't see anything without it.

673
00:45:07,530 --> 00:45:09,659
That's not how it works.

674
00:45:09,660 --> 00:45:10,839
Dump it down the drain.

675
00:45:10,840 --> 00:45:13,899
It's done, you can already
see the other side.

676
00:45:13,900 --> 00:45:14,900
Is that so?

677
00:45:15,890 --> 00:45:17,679
How many awful things
did you have to endure

678
00:45:17,680 --> 00:45:19,230
before you got to see your son?

679
00:45:20,170 --> 00:45:21,170
Patience.

680
00:45:22,040 --> 00:45:23,940
You told me to take a leap of faith.

681
00:45:25,217 --> 00:45:26,217
I did.

682
00:45:28,573 --> 00:45:30,433
When do I get to see my daughter?

683
00:45:31,350 --> 00:45:33,005
[Jan] You're not there yet.

684
00:45:33,006 --> 00:45:34,006
When then?

685
00:45:35,294 --> 00:45:36,944
When I've gone completely insane?

686
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:40,889
Insane people don't have the wherewithal

687
00:45:40,890 --> 00:45:42,783
to acknowledge their own insanity.

688
00:45:46,660 --> 00:45:50,713
I saw my daughter's dead body
come alive in the bath tub.

689
00:45:54,620 --> 00:45:58,339
What does that do to help me
understand her or her illness?

690
00:45:58,340 --> 00:46:00,249
Ally, it's not that simple.

691
00:46:00,250 --> 00:46:02,419
Perhaps she's waiting for
you to sort something out

692
00:46:02,420 --> 00:46:03,485
with her father.

693
00:46:03,486 --> 00:46:05,286
Like what?

694
00:46:05,287 --> 00:46:07,949
[Jan] Do you know where
Michael stands with you?

695
00:46:07,950 --> 00:46:08,950
With your family?

696
00:46:10,560 --> 00:46:11,893
He wants to have a baby.

697
00:46:13,600 --> 00:46:14,600
Really?

698
00:46:16,220 --> 00:46:18,269
A replacement for Samantha?

699
00:46:18,270 --> 00:46:19,923
No, not like that.

700
00:46:23,550 --> 00:46:25,913
- How old are you?
- 36.

701
00:46:27,620 --> 00:46:28,620
Why?

702
00:46:30,170 --> 00:46:31,799
You don't have much time left.

703
00:46:31,800 --> 00:46:32,800
[Ally] For what?

704
00:46:34,506 --> 00:46:35,756
To have a family again.

705
00:46:37,410 --> 00:46:39,349
Time is limited for Michael as well.

706
00:46:39,350 --> 00:46:42,499
If this is what he wants,
he might consider starting

707
00:46:42,500 --> 00:46:43,863
a family with someone else.

708
00:46:44,826 --> 00:46:47,649
On what planet would
that be considered helpful?

709
00:46:47,650 --> 00:46:49,569
It's part of the process.

710
00:46:49,570 --> 00:46:50,709
Get out.

711
00:46:50,710 --> 00:46:51,710
[Jan] Ally.

712
00:46:53,846 --> 00:46:55,899
I don't like the way I
feel when I'm with you.

713
00:46:55,900 --> 00:46:58,750
[Jan] You knew that I would
push you to talk, remember?

714
00:47:00,450 --> 00:47:05,450
I've decided that
drugs and ghost stories

715
00:47:05,800 --> 00:47:06,943
are not good therapy.

716
00:47:08,860 --> 00:47:10,377
I don't mean to offend.

717
00:47:10,378 --> 00:47:11,878
I'm not gonna ask you again.

718
00:47:16,493 --> 00:47:19,493
(light eerie music)

719
00:47:24,338 --> 00:47:26,546
(door creaking)
(Ally crying)

720
00:47:26,547 --> 00:47:29,214
(door slamming)

721
00:47:35,569 --> 00:47:38,486
(shower pattering)

722
00:47:47,669 --> 00:47:50,169
(eerie music)

723
00:47:53,202 --> 00:47:55,446
(flesh squishing)

724
00:47:55,447 --> 00:47:58,114
(door thudding)

725
00:47:59,580 --> 00:48:00,853
Michael, are you home?

726
00:48:05,444 --> 00:48:08,277
(water splashing)

727
00:48:12,991 --> 00:48:14,339
(Ally gasps)
(tense music)

728
00:48:14,340 --> 00:48:16,367
Jesus, kid, enough with the jump scares.

729
00:48:25,488 --> 00:48:26,905
What do you want?

730
00:48:30,625 --> 00:48:33,625
(light eerie music)

731
00:48:51,766 --> 00:48:54,472
Why do you torture me with memories?

732
00:48:54,473 --> 00:48:58,306
(light eerie music continues)

733
00:49:13,833 --> 00:49:16,416
(bat clanking)

734
00:49:21,635 --> 00:49:24,052
(Ally sighs)

735
00:49:30,152 --> 00:49:33,152
(soft creepy music)

736
00:49:38,483 --> 00:49:41,483
(footsteps tapping)

737
00:49:56,435 --> 00:49:57,435
Samantha?

738
00:50:01,496 --> 00:50:02,496
Mornin'.

739
00:50:07,899 --> 00:50:10,029
Am I dreaming?

740
00:50:10,030 --> 00:50:11,030
No.

741
00:50:12,320 --> 00:50:13,320
It's really me.

742
00:50:15,917 --> 00:50:18,099
(Ally crying)

743
00:50:18,100 --> 00:50:19,909
[Ally] I miss you so much.

744
00:50:19,910 --> 00:50:23,273
Mom, you need to listen to me.

745
00:50:25,191 --> 00:50:26,274
What is it?

746
00:50:27,237 --> 00:50:29,163
You're going down the same path.

747
00:50:32,770 --> 00:50:34,093
You're seeing what I saw.

748
00:50:36,498 --> 00:50:38,098
But you've yet to see the worst.

749
00:50:43,312 --> 00:50:44,562
It never stops.

750
00:50:47,084 --> 00:50:48,290
(Ally crying)

751
00:50:48,291 --> 00:50:50,764
I'm so sorry, I didn't know.

752
00:50:50,765 --> 00:50:51,765
But you did know.

753
00:50:53,170 --> 00:50:54,170
I was sick.

754
00:50:58,887 --> 00:51:00,199
(Ally sniffling)

755
00:51:00,200 --> 00:51:02,222
I've wished so many
times I could stop you

756
00:51:02,223 --> 00:51:04,969
from going in that garage.

757
00:51:04,970 --> 00:51:06,620
[Samantha] Stop making excuses.

758
00:51:08,236 --> 00:51:09,679
(Ally sighs)

759
00:51:09,680 --> 00:51:11,287
So you do blame me?

760
00:51:12,450 --> 00:51:14,250
Don't you wanna make things right?

761
00:51:17,552 --> 00:51:18,602
I don't understand.

762
00:51:19,664 --> 00:51:20,964
You've become a shut-in.

763
00:51:21,880 --> 00:51:26,880
Your career, your marriage,
your life is a joke.

764
00:51:29,100 --> 00:51:30,100
What?

765
00:51:31,468 --> 00:51:32,620
Why would you say that?

766
00:51:33,650 --> 00:51:36,103
You've nailed yourself to a cross.

767
00:51:36,947 --> 00:51:38,529
Why?

768
00:51:38,530 --> 00:51:40,423
To prove you were a good mother?

769
00:51:41,874 --> 00:51:43,463
You don't think I was a good mother?

770
00:51:51,442 --> 00:51:54,109
But you can make things right.

771
00:51:56,192 --> 00:51:57,192
End it.

772
00:51:58,863 --> 00:52:01,573
Give me your eyes.

773
00:52:03,590 --> 00:52:04,590
Your eyes.

774
00:52:05,360 --> 00:52:06,360
Give 'em to me.

775
00:52:07,198 --> 00:52:10,784
(knife clinking)
(suspenseful music)

776
00:52:10,785 --> 00:52:13,710
(Samantha cackling)

777
00:52:13,711 --> 00:52:14,899
You're not real.

778
00:52:14,900 --> 00:52:17,000
- Oh, am I real now?
- (dramatic music)

779
00:52:17,001 --> 00:52:19,584
(Ally gagging)

780
00:52:21,329 --> 00:52:22,328
(Ally gasping)

781
00:52:22,329 --> 00:52:23,776
Some of 'em slit their wrists.

782
00:52:23,777 --> 00:52:25,903
Some of 'em put a gun in their mouth.

783
00:52:27,563 --> 00:52:28,813
You'll cut out your eyes.

784
00:52:30,917 --> 00:52:32,417
Just like she did.

785
00:52:33,778 --> 00:52:35,028
Just like this.

786
00:52:36,308 --> 00:52:37,852
(flesh squishing)
(Ally screaming)

787
00:52:37,853 --> 00:52:39,052
Ally, what's wrong?

788
00:52:39,053 --> 00:52:43,584
What happened?
(Ally gasping)

789
00:52:43,585 --> 00:52:45,880
What happened, babe?

790
00:52:45,881 --> 00:52:48,324
You just walked into the
kitchen and started screaming.

791
00:52:48,325 --> 00:52:49,157
What the hell's going on?

792
00:52:49,158 --> 00:52:51,403
- I thought I saw Sam.
- You, whoa, whoa, whoa.

793
00:52:51,404 --> 00:52:52,359
But it wasn't her.

794
00:52:52,360 --> 00:52:53,960
You thought you saw Sam again?

795
00:52:55,188 --> 00:52:56,780
That's it, I'm taking you to a doctor.

796
00:52:56,781 --> 00:52:58,299
[Ally] No.

797
00:52:58,300 --> 00:52:59,479
I'm not gonna sit back and watch you

798
00:52:59,480 --> 00:53:01,186
keep doing this to yourself.

799
00:53:01,187 --> 00:53:03,682
(Ally crying)

800
00:53:03,683 --> 00:53:04,515
If you won't leave the house,

801
00:53:04,516 --> 00:53:06,270
I'm gonna call one and bring one here.

802
00:53:07,110 --> 00:53:08,960
I'm sorry, but this is nonnegotiable.

803
00:53:12,999 --> 00:53:16,249
(light dramatic music)

804
00:53:18,330 --> 00:53:20,179
Physically you're fine.

805
00:53:20,180 --> 00:53:22,093
- It's just stress.
- That's it?

806
00:53:22,930 --> 00:53:25,889
With a traumatic event like
you've both been through,

807
00:53:25,890 --> 00:53:27,040
it's perfectly natural.

808
00:53:28,839 --> 00:53:31,247
Are you taking any medications currently?

809
00:53:31,248 --> 00:53:32,186
I take a Valium sometimes.

810
00:53:32,187 --> 00:53:34,319
- You take that with alcohol?
- She hasn't had anything

811
00:53:34,320 --> 00:53:35,539
to drink today.

812
00:53:35,540 --> 00:53:37,990
Michael, this is
embarrassing enough as it is.

813
00:53:37,991 --> 00:53:39,341
He doesn't need to be here.

814
00:53:40,460 --> 00:53:42,699
Well, I brought some
samples 'cause I thought

815
00:53:42,700 --> 00:53:43,823
they'd come in handy.

816
00:53:44,920 --> 00:53:46,720
And I will write you a prescription.

817
00:53:51,730 --> 00:53:53,039
Take one of those once a day.

818
00:53:53,040 --> 00:53:55,193
Only those, no other pills, no booze.

819
00:53:56,060 --> 00:53:56,951
What is it?

820
00:53:56,952 --> 00:53:57,784
It's a strong sedative.

821
00:53:57,785 --> 00:54:00,033
- It'll keep you calm.
- And then what?

822
00:54:02,334 --> 00:54:05,056
The elephant in the room, the visions.

823
00:54:05,057 --> 00:54:06,339
I need to run some tests.

824
00:54:06,340 --> 00:54:08,089
An MRI is a good start.

825
00:54:08,090 --> 00:54:09,619
- I don't need an MRI.
- Ally.

826
00:54:09,620 --> 00:54:10,859
I'm not stressed.

827
00:54:10,860 --> 00:54:11,692
I'm not crazy.

828
00:54:11,693 --> 00:54:13,259
I'm not having a nervous breakdown.

829
00:54:13,260 --> 00:54:14,959
It was all a hallucination.

830
00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:17,009
I've been drinking a
tea that had this stuff

831
00:54:17,010 --> 00:54:18,010
called Datura in it.

832
00:54:18,930 --> 00:54:19,959
Datura?

833
00:54:19,960 --> 00:54:21,330
Well, that's Jimsonweed.

834
00:54:22,364 --> 00:54:24,559
[Ally] I don't know, sure.

835
00:54:24,560 --> 00:54:27,199
[Michael] Okay, can somebody fill me in?

836
00:54:27,200 --> 00:54:28,799
It's a drug that makes you see things.

837
00:54:28,800 --> 00:54:29,853
It's poison.

838
00:54:30,760 --> 00:54:33,070
We may need to get her to the ER.

839
00:54:33,071 --> 00:54:35,404
No, I'm not on it anymore.

840
00:54:36,270 --> 00:54:37,529
I swear.

841
00:54:37,530 --> 00:54:38,549
It will kill you.

842
00:54:38,550 --> 00:54:39,600
You know that, right?

843
00:54:40,660 --> 00:54:41,759
How much?

844
00:54:41,760 --> 00:54:42,592
How much what?

845
00:54:42,593 --> 00:54:43,425
Would kill you?

846
00:54:43,426 --> 00:54:44,639
Any amount, the smallest amount.

847
00:54:44,640 --> 00:54:47,219
Please do not take this lightly.

848
00:54:47,220 --> 00:54:49,239
This is not magic mushrooms
where you get a case

849
00:54:49,240 --> 00:54:51,649
of the giggles while
watching the carpet breathe.

850
00:54:51,650 --> 00:54:53,429
Datura is something else entirely.

851
00:54:53,430 --> 00:54:56,699
It's having conversations
with people that don't exist.

852
00:54:56,700 --> 00:54:59,479
Assuming you don't die,
it's self-induced insanity.

853
00:54:59,480 --> 00:55:00,579
Ally.

854
00:55:00,580 --> 00:55:02,139
The therapist, she gave it to me.

855
00:55:02,140 --> 00:55:04,023
The lady making the house calls?

856
00:55:04,980 --> 00:55:07,357
I knew something was up with that quack.

857
00:55:07,358 --> 00:55:08,818
Do you still have this drug?

858
00:55:08,819 --> 00:55:12,389
- (Michael scoffs)
- Yeah.

859
00:55:12,390 --> 00:55:13,559
It is all a stupid mistake.

860
00:55:13,560 --> 00:55:15,069
I'm getting it right now.

861
00:55:15,070 --> 00:55:16,679
Please take it out of my hands.

862
00:55:16,680 --> 00:55:18,629
This is all a disaster, really.

863
00:55:18,630 --> 00:55:19,909
The therapist that gave it to you,

864
00:55:19,910 --> 00:55:22,109
do you have their contact information?

865
00:55:22,110 --> 00:55:24,673
Yes, I'll get you her card.

866
00:55:26,760 --> 00:55:27,689
[Michael] No wonder
she'd feel the effects

867
00:55:27,690 --> 00:55:28,690
if it was a drug.

868
00:55:30,030 --> 00:55:31,294
Under the influence it's impossible

869
00:55:31,295 --> 00:55:32,845
to decern fantasy from reality.

870
00:55:34,140 --> 00:55:36,773
Your daughter, she saw things too?

871
00:55:38,320 --> 00:55:40,859
Yeah, but it wasn't drugs.

872
00:55:40,860 --> 00:55:42,529
We had an autopsy done.

873
00:55:42,530 --> 00:55:44,169
Does mental illness run in the family?

874
00:55:44,170 --> 00:55:45,399
- No.
- Schizophrenia?

875
00:55:45,400 --> 00:55:47,689
No, no, nothing like that.

876
00:55:47,690 --> 00:55:51,789
Um, but listen, this has been
going on for a while now.

877
00:55:51,790 --> 00:55:54,313
She won't leave the house, ever.

878
00:55:55,820 --> 00:55:57,020
I think she's losing it.

879
00:55:59,070 --> 00:56:01,224
I think she's causing me to lose it, too.

880
00:56:01,225 --> 00:56:03,225
I can't find her card.

881
00:56:05,230 --> 00:56:08,399
Her name is Janice Rollins,
I'll find her number later.

882
00:56:08,400 --> 00:56:10,329
It's fine, I can
probably dig up some info

883
00:56:10,330 --> 00:56:11,162
just based on the name.

884
00:56:11,163 --> 00:56:12,649
Why would you do something like this?

885
00:56:12,650 --> 00:56:15,539
You're in the medical field,
you should know better.

886
00:56:15,540 --> 00:56:18,329
She told me I could
see my daughter again.

887
00:56:18,330 --> 00:56:19,430
What does that mean?

888
00:56:20,270 --> 00:56:22,309
Sam's ghost, I could talk
to her on the other side.

889
00:56:22,310 --> 00:56:23,760
[Michael] Oh, Jesus Christ.

890
00:56:27,550 --> 00:56:29,119
What's in this stuff?

891
00:56:29,120 --> 00:56:31,159
It's strong, like I said.

892
00:56:31,160 --> 00:56:32,469
Just get some rest.

893
00:56:32,470 --> 00:56:34,720
You need to get this
stuff outta your system.

894
00:56:35,970 --> 00:56:37,980
Let me borrow you for a second.

895
00:56:40,120 --> 00:56:40,952
You gotta do something.

896
00:56:40,953 --> 00:56:43,082
Yeah, I'm gonna do some tests for me,

897
00:56:43,083 --> 00:56:45,275
we'll get this sorted out.

898
00:56:45,276 --> 00:56:47,199
What kinda stuff are you worried about?

899
00:56:47,200 --> 00:56:49,728
(indistinct whispers)

900
00:56:49,729 --> 00:56:53,141
(light dramatic music)

901
00:56:53,142 --> 00:56:55,642
(eerie music)

902
00:56:57,214 --> 00:57:00,464
(distorted whispering)

903
00:57:03,266 --> 00:57:06,016
(ominous music)

904
00:57:12,596 --> 00:57:15,596
(suspenseful music)

905
00:57:18,236 --> 00:57:21,069
(flesh squishing)

906
00:57:39,356 --> 00:57:41,773
(Ally sighs)

907
00:57:44,548 --> 00:57:45,548
Ally?

908
00:57:46,748 --> 00:57:49,831
[Ally] How long have I been asleep?

909
00:57:52,401 --> 00:57:53,401
18 hours.

910
00:57:55,020 --> 00:57:57,437
(Ally sighs)

911
00:58:03,093 --> 00:58:04,453
It's okay, you needed it.

912
00:58:06,361 --> 00:58:09,361
The doctor said that stuff can
stay in your system for days.

913
00:58:14,250 --> 00:58:16,079
Why aren't you at work?

914
00:58:16,080 --> 00:58:18,119
I'm taking a few days off.

915
00:58:18,120 --> 00:58:19,203
[Ally] Why?

916
00:58:22,350 --> 00:58:23,800
I wanna keep an eye on you.

917
00:58:25,570 --> 00:58:28,242
Sweetie, you don't need to do that.

918
00:58:28,243 --> 00:58:32,292
I know I've been a mess, but
I don't need a babysitter.

919
00:58:32,293 --> 00:58:33,293
It's okay.

920
00:58:34,800 --> 00:58:35,800
I wanna be here.

921
00:58:38,918 --> 00:58:40,768
That was pretty scary shit, you know?

922
00:58:42,769 --> 00:58:44,619
I'm gonna make it right, I promise.

923
00:58:45,717 --> 00:58:47,139
I should a known something
was up the other day

924
00:58:47,140 --> 00:58:49,590
when you thought you saw
someone in the backyard.

925
00:58:52,549 --> 00:58:55,499
I mean, why would you
do something like that?

926
00:58:55,500 --> 00:58:57,423
Take a drug from a complete stranger?

927
00:58:59,279 --> 00:59:01,819
I wanted to see Samantha so
bad, I had nothing to lose.

928
00:59:01,820 --> 00:59:03,419
I was ready to die.

929
00:59:03,420 --> 00:59:05,149
So the other night when you said

930
00:59:05,150 --> 00:59:08,423
you were just being
dramatic, that was a lie?

931
00:59:10,877 --> 00:59:11,877
Yeah.

932
00:59:13,977 --> 00:59:15,112
(Michael sighs)

933
00:59:15,113 --> 00:59:18,113
(light eerie music)

934
00:59:21,320 --> 00:59:22,600
I don't know what else to say.

935
00:59:29,753 --> 00:59:33,088
This is my wake-up call, sweetie.

936
00:59:33,089 --> 00:59:34,823
I'm so embarrassed.

937
00:59:34,824 --> 00:59:36,423
I drank poison from a stranger.

938
00:59:38,313 --> 00:59:39,419
I've been a walking disaster.

939
00:59:39,420 --> 00:59:40,587
It's not fair to you.

940
00:59:42,039 --> 00:59:44,492
And a string of bad decisions.

941
00:59:44,493 --> 00:59:45,993
I wanna do better.

942
00:59:47,804 --> 00:59:51,732
(Michael sighs)
I'll make it right.

943
00:59:51,733 --> 00:59:52,733
How?

944
00:59:54,857 --> 00:59:56,107
I don't know.

945
00:59:59,453 --> 01:00:03,126
I feel like everything's gonna be okay.

946
01:00:03,127 --> 01:00:05,680
(Michael sighs)

947
01:00:05,681 --> 01:00:10,098
Once you hit rock bottom,
there's only one way to go.

948
01:00:11,785 --> 01:00:14,452
(lips smacking)

949
01:00:19,157 --> 01:00:21,740
(gentle music)

950
01:00:33,037 --> 01:00:34,537
I've missed you.

951
01:00:35,776 --> 01:00:40,776
(lips smacking)
(gentle music)

952
01:01:06,181 --> 01:01:07,013
[Jan] This is Jan Rollins.

953
01:01:07,014 --> 01:01:08,373
Leave me a message.

954
01:01:09,970 --> 01:01:12,020
Hey, Jan, what you did, I need answers.

955
01:01:27,762 --> 01:01:29,262
Feeling all right?

956
01:01:30,630 --> 01:01:32,180
[Michael] What are you doing?

957
01:01:33,140 --> 01:01:34,140
Strategy.

958
01:01:35,097 --> 01:01:36,947
I'm gonna hit up all my old patients.

959
01:01:38,720 --> 01:01:39,720
Why?

960
01:01:41,480 --> 01:01:42,933
I'm gonna start my own practice.

961
01:01:46,630 --> 01:01:49,359
Are you sure you're ready
for something like that?

962
01:01:49,360 --> 01:01:50,360
Probably not.

963
01:01:51,370 --> 01:01:53,809
But I'll tell myself I am
as many times as I need to

964
01:01:53,810 --> 01:01:55,190
until I believe it.

965
01:01:57,353 --> 01:01:59,139
I'm too good to work for
a healthcare network.

966
01:01:59,140 --> 01:02:01,349
I should've broken off
on my own years ago,

967
01:02:01,350 --> 01:02:02,650
but I was just too scared.

968
01:02:04,339 --> 01:02:06,729
[Michael] That's great.

969
01:02:06,730 --> 01:02:08,705
I got in this business to help people,

970
01:02:08,706 --> 01:02:10,006
and I wanna get that back.

971
01:02:11,890 --> 01:02:12,722
I don't wanna get ahead of myself,

972
01:02:12,723 --> 01:02:16,259
but I might take your suggestion

973
01:02:16,260 --> 01:02:18,603
and start coaching softball again.

974
01:02:21,330 --> 01:02:22,330
Wow.

975
01:02:28,650 --> 01:02:30,969
No booze?
(ominous music)

976
01:02:30,970 --> 01:02:31,970
Baby steps.

977
01:02:34,410 --> 01:02:36,660
Baby steps would be
going outside for once.

978
01:02:40,600 --> 01:02:41,900
What's with you tonight?

979
01:02:45,430 --> 01:02:48,379
- Hello?
- Hi, Kate.

980
01:02:48,380 --> 01:02:49,380
[Kate] Oh, my God.

981
01:02:50,490 --> 01:02:52,552
[Ally] I'm sorry it's been a while.

982
01:02:52,553 --> 01:02:54,959
[Kate] It is so good to hear from you.

983
01:02:54,960 --> 01:02:56,129
Are you okay?

984
01:02:56,130 --> 01:02:58,175
[Ally] Yeah, no, I'm good.

985
01:02:58,176 --> 01:02:59,949
I remembered that postcard you gave me

986
01:02:59,950 --> 01:03:01,150
with the mountain scape.

987
01:03:02,377 --> 01:03:04,532
It really meant a lot to me, so thank you.

988
01:03:04,533 --> 01:03:05,559
[Kate] Are you kidding?

989
01:03:05,560 --> 01:03:07,869
- Anytime.
- Thank you.

990
01:03:07,870 --> 01:03:11,069
Well, I'm gonna be starting
my own practice soon,

991
01:03:11,070 --> 01:03:14,779
and if you wanted to continue
our sessions we could do that.

992
01:03:14,780 --> 01:03:18,331
Maybe in a few weeks or
months even, when I'm settled.

993
01:03:18,332 --> 01:03:19,569
[Kate] Really?

994
01:03:19,570 --> 01:03:22,129
Congrats, that's so exciting.

995
01:03:22,130 --> 01:03:23,359
Of course.

996
01:03:23,360 --> 01:03:24,727
I speak the world of you.

997
01:03:25,612 --> 01:03:27,056
Thank you.

998
01:03:27,057 --> 01:03:28,253
I'm to the moon, Kate.

999
01:03:29,740 --> 01:03:31,040
I guess we'll be in touch.

1000
01:03:31,985 --> 01:03:32,985
Okay, bye.

1001
01:03:38,464 --> 01:03:40,964
(light music)

1002
01:03:52,340 --> 01:03:53,340
- Hello?
- Terry.

1003
01:03:54,080 --> 01:03:55,028
[Terry] Ally?

1004
01:03:55,029 --> 01:03:55,861
I've been meaning to call you.

1005
01:03:55,862 --> 01:03:58,679
That therapist you recommended,
she's a real piece of work.

1006
01:03:58,680 --> 01:04:02,209
Did she give hallucinogenetic
drugs to your sister too?

1007
01:04:02,210 --> 01:04:03,869
- I'm sorry, what?
- How could you recommend

1008
01:04:03,870 --> 01:04:04,870
someone like that?

1009
01:04:05,953 --> 01:04:08,879
[Terry] I'm a bit lost right now.

1010
01:04:08,880 --> 01:04:09,712
What, what do you mean?

1011
01:04:09,713 --> 01:04:11,739
You called, you left me
a message about a therapist

1012
01:04:11,740 --> 01:04:12,909
you called a miracle worker.

1013
01:04:12,910 --> 01:04:14,519
You don't remember that.

1014
01:04:14,520 --> 01:04:16,199
Yeah, yeah, he's great.

1015
01:04:16,200 --> 01:04:17,333
- Dave Myer.
- He?

1016
01:04:18,350 --> 01:04:20,669
[Terry] Yes, is that a problem?

1017
01:04:20,670 --> 01:04:22,719
Who is Jan Rollins?

1018
01:04:22,720 --> 01:04:25,543
[Terry] I'm sorry, I don't
know anybody by that name.

1019
01:04:26,660 --> 01:04:28,069
Ally, what the hell's going on?

1020
01:04:28,070 --> 01:04:29,070
Is everything okay?

1021
01:04:34,533 --> 01:04:36,709
I just got off the phone with Terry.

1022
01:04:36,710 --> 01:04:37,919
Can this wait?

1023
01:04:37,920 --> 01:04:39,739
No, actually, it can't!

1024
01:04:39,740 --> 01:04:43,957
Ally, I just wanna be left alone.

1025
01:04:43,958 --> 01:04:45,358
What the hell is with you?

1026
01:04:46,742 --> 01:04:49,409
(ominous music)

1027
01:05:00,722 --> 01:05:01,722
Hey.

1028
01:05:02,740 --> 01:05:03,740
You're awake.

1029
01:05:11,437 --> 01:05:13,854
Come on, what's the matter?

1030
01:05:17,320 --> 01:05:18,883
I had a terrible dream.

1031
01:05:21,006 --> 01:05:22,339
What happened?

1032
01:05:24,702 --> 01:05:26,035
I feel stupid.

1033
01:05:27,850 --> 01:05:30,203
Well, after everything I
think you get a few passes.

1034
01:05:34,010 --> 01:05:36,310
This thing was chasing
me through the woods.

1035
01:05:38,330 --> 01:05:39,623
At lightning speeds.

1036
01:05:42,020 --> 01:05:44,853
It was like I was in slow motion.

1037
01:05:47,310 --> 01:05:51,080
Finally get to a house,
to safety, to the door...

1038
01:05:54,070 --> 01:05:55,820
And my foot hits a rock and I fall.

1039
01:05:57,578 --> 01:05:59,414
I'm sure it's just a dream.

1040
01:05:59,415 --> 01:06:00,498
No, no, no.

1041
01:06:01,540 --> 01:06:03,760
This was so real, it was different.

1042
01:06:07,789 --> 01:06:12,559
This face, it's the
most burned and scarred,

1043
01:06:12,560 --> 01:06:14,463
and there were no eyes.

1044
01:06:16,470 --> 01:06:19,543
Just burns all over.

1045
01:06:22,485 --> 01:06:25,144
[Ally] I wanna show you something.

1046
01:06:25,145 --> 01:06:26,978
Where are you going?

1047
01:06:33,057 --> 01:06:34,974
Is that what you saw?

1048
01:06:41,963 --> 01:06:43,843
I got spooked from a bad dream.

1049
01:06:46,040 --> 01:06:48,330
You don't have to make fun of me.

1050
01:06:48,331 --> 01:06:50,009
I'm not making fun of you.

1051
01:06:50,010 --> 01:06:51,469
Sam saw that.

1052
01:06:51,470 --> 01:06:52,470
Sam drew that.

1053
01:06:53,673 --> 01:06:55,373
Are you on that drug again?

1054
01:06:57,350 --> 01:06:59,363
No, of course not.

1055
01:07:04,070 --> 01:07:05,769
[Michael] Then why'd you bring me this?

1056
01:07:05,770 --> 01:07:07,520
Because you saw it in your dream!

1057
01:07:10,795 --> 01:07:12,949
Does what I described
sound like a penguin?

1058
01:07:12,950 --> 01:07:14,603
No, the face with no eyes.

1059
01:07:20,330 --> 01:07:21,983
Or a Pegasus with rainbow hair?

1060
01:07:24,190 --> 01:07:25,190
Or puppies?

1061
01:07:28,210 --> 01:07:30,709
[Ally] There are pictures
of the face with no eyes

1062
01:07:30,710 --> 01:07:32,280
and scars and-

1063
01:07:32,281 --> 01:07:34,809
That's what you thought you saw!

1064
01:07:34,810 --> 01:07:36,510
[Ally] You saw it in your dream.

1065
01:07:37,960 --> 01:07:39,660
I must've heard you describe it.

1066
01:07:42,773 --> 01:07:44,632
It was just a bad dream.

1067
01:07:44,633 --> 01:07:46,172
(phone ringing)

1068
01:07:46,173 --> 01:07:48,840
(ominous music)

1069
01:07:52,150 --> 01:07:53,289
[Ally] Hello?

1070
01:07:53,290 --> 01:07:54,122
[Dr. Harris] Mrs. Larkin.

1071
01:07:54,123 --> 01:07:55,419
Hello, it's Dr. Harris.

1072
01:07:55,420 --> 01:07:56,783
Is your husband in?

1073
01:07:58,920 --> 01:07:59,956
No, he's out.

1074
01:07:59,957 --> 01:08:00,963
Can I help you?

1075
01:08:02,220 --> 01:08:03,783
[Dr. Harris] How are you feeling?

1076
01:08:04,760 --> 01:08:06,169
Fine.

1077
01:08:06,170 --> 01:08:09,269
[Dr. Harris] Are you taking
that sedative I prescribed?

1078
01:08:09,270 --> 01:08:11,378
Um, not since the first day.

1079
01:08:11,379 --> 01:08:12,971
I haven't needed it.

1080
01:08:12,972 --> 01:08:14,359
[Dr. Harris] Oh, great.

1081
01:08:14,360 --> 01:08:16,210
Have you had any more hallucinations?

1082
01:08:18,270 --> 01:08:19,673
No, it was just the tea.

1083
01:08:20,760 --> 01:08:23,269
[Dr. Harris] That's
what I'm calling about.

1084
01:08:23,270 --> 01:08:26,399
We did extensive tests on
the liquid in that bottle,

1085
01:08:26,400 --> 01:08:28,609
and there was no Datura present.

1086
01:08:28,610 --> 01:08:31,410
In fact, there was nothing
out of the ordinary about it.

1087
01:08:35,053 --> 01:08:37,023
I'm sorry, I don't understand.

1088
01:08:37,024 --> 01:08:38,129
[Dr. Harris] It was iced tea.

1089
01:08:38,130 --> 01:08:39,737
Just iced tea.

1090
01:08:43,835 --> 01:08:45,509
That's impossible.

1091
01:08:45,510 --> 01:08:46,999
- [Dr. Harris] Mrs.
- Larkin, when I said before

1092
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:50,563
that we should run-
(distorted whispers)

1093
01:08:55,998 --> 01:08:58,581
[Samantha] Give me your eyes.

1094
01:09:01,883 --> 01:09:04,271
[Michael] I think she's
causing me to lose it too.

1095
01:09:04,272 --> 01:09:09,272
(eerie music)
(distorted whispers)

1096
01:09:23,389 --> 01:09:26,639
(light dramatic music)

1097
01:09:31,075 --> 01:09:32,575
So you are real!

1098
01:09:36,260 --> 01:09:38,093
This is what you want?

1099
01:09:40,572 --> 01:09:42,572
No, it's this, isn't it?

1100
01:09:46,433 --> 01:09:49,433
(light eerie music)

1101
01:09:53,244 --> 01:09:54,661
You want my eyes?

1102
01:09:56,685 --> 01:09:59,185
Come and cut 'em out yourself!

1103
01:10:00,689 --> 01:10:03,606
(doorbell ringing)

1104
01:10:09,526 --> 01:10:14,526
(fist knocking)
(doorbell ringing)

1105
01:10:14,830 --> 01:10:16,539
[Jan] Ally, listen to me.

1106
01:10:16,540 --> 01:10:19,689
The Ubuso, it's real and
it's gone after Michael.

1107
01:10:19,690 --> 01:10:21,529
I thought we could beat
it before it got to you,

1108
01:10:21,530 --> 01:10:22,679
but it's moved on.

1109
01:10:22,680 --> 01:10:24,053
Time is of the essence.

1110
01:10:25,110 --> 01:10:26,029
You lied to me.

1111
01:10:26,030 --> 01:10:27,759
You let me think that
you were Terry's guy.

1112
01:10:27,760 --> 01:10:28,959
I trusted you.

1113
01:10:28,960 --> 01:10:30,519
[Jan] I had to.

1114
01:10:30,520 --> 01:10:33,120
You would've brushed off
the whole idea if I hadn't.

1115
01:10:34,240 --> 01:10:37,099
Leap of faith, remember?

1116
01:10:37,100 --> 01:10:39,449
I needed you to believe.

1117
01:10:39,450 --> 01:10:42,793
- Is your name even Jan?
- No.

1118
01:10:43,840 --> 01:10:46,543
What I do, I have to take precautions.

1119
01:10:47,690 --> 01:10:50,163
Listen, you and your
husband are in danger.

1120
01:10:50,164 --> 01:10:51,369
Everything you say is bullshit.

1121
01:10:51,370 --> 01:10:52,570
Why would I believe you?

1122
01:10:53,630 --> 01:10:55,973
[Jan] Because you need my help.

1123
01:10:56,830 --> 01:11:00,079
What was the last thing
that Samantha said to you?

1124
01:11:00,080 --> 01:11:02,133
Nothing good, was it?

1125
01:11:07,210 --> 01:11:08,210
Fuck off.

1126
01:11:12,998 --> 01:11:16,081
That's the last thing she said to me.

1127
01:11:24,781 --> 01:11:26,364
Start making sense.

1128
01:11:30,976 --> 01:11:32,329
(door slamming)

1129
01:11:32,330 --> 01:11:35,589
In every case of the
Ubuso, the last victim tries

1130
01:11:35,590 --> 01:11:37,593
to commune with the living to warn them.

1131
01:11:38,710 --> 01:11:40,393
To tell them how to stop it.

1132
01:11:41,840 --> 01:11:44,959
That's why it is so
important to get to Samantha

1133
01:11:44,960 --> 01:11:46,496
before it's too late.

1134
01:11:46,497 --> 01:11:48,143
I've already seen her.

1135
01:11:48,144 --> 01:11:50,139
Her corpse crawling out of a body bag.

1136
01:11:50,140 --> 01:11:51,896
A girl taunting me to cut my eyes out.

1137
01:11:51,897 --> 01:11:53,749
That's not my daughter.

1138
01:11:53,750 --> 01:11:54,800
Of course it isn't.

1139
01:11:55,960 --> 01:11:59,709
It's using her likeness
to drive you insane.

1140
01:11:59,710 --> 01:12:01,063
Until you kill yourself.

1141
01:12:02,610 --> 01:12:04,527
That's what it wants.

1142
01:12:04,528 --> 01:12:05,878
How do you know all this?

1143
01:12:07,110 --> 01:12:10,419
I've been following it
since my missionary days.

1144
01:12:10,420 --> 01:12:12,479
I've followed it all over the world.

1145
01:12:12,480 --> 01:12:14,159
Why am I seeing a boy with no mouth?

1146
01:12:14,160 --> 01:12:15,319
And why was there a man wearing

1147
01:12:15,320 --> 01:12:16,963
a doll's mask in my backyard?

1148
01:12:17,848 --> 01:12:21,949
Ubuso, faces, a shape shifter.

1149
01:12:21,950 --> 01:12:23,733
All illusions to scare you.

1150
01:12:25,892 --> 01:12:27,792
Why haven't I seen the eyeless face?

1151
01:12:31,780 --> 01:12:33,379
We need to talk to Samantha.

1152
01:12:33,380 --> 01:12:34,380
Where's Michael?

1153
01:12:35,310 --> 01:12:36,899
Running errands, why?

1154
01:12:36,900 --> 01:12:39,303
- We need him.
- We do?

1155
01:12:40,680 --> 01:12:42,463
Clearly it's gotten to him.

1156
01:12:43,330 --> 01:12:45,973
He's already seen it, hasn't he?

1157
01:12:47,660 --> 01:12:49,577
What do I have to do?

1158
01:12:51,860 --> 01:12:53,560
I need you to gather some items.

1159
01:12:58,572 --> 01:13:01,822
(light dramatic music)

1160
01:13:03,890 --> 01:13:04,890
What now?

1161
01:13:08,610 --> 01:13:09,910
Just wait.

1162
01:13:14,336 --> 01:13:19,336
(light eerie music)
(door latch clicking)

1163
01:13:19,768 --> 01:13:21,359
(door slamming)

1164
01:13:21,360 --> 01:13:22,949
Michael, before you get angry.

1165
01:13:22,950 --> 01:13:24,709
Just let me explain.

1166
01:13:24,710 --> 01:13:27,229
The thing you saw in
your dream with no eyes,

1167
01:13:27,230 --> 01:13:28,959
it's what killed Samantha.

1168
01:13:28,960 --> 01:13:30,760
And this is how we're gonna stop it.

1169
01:13:33,080 --> 01:13:35,589
That's Jan, she's the
therapist I've been talking to,

1170
01:13:35,590 --> 01:13:36,469
but she can help us.

1171
01:13:36,470 --> 01:13:38,809
And I know you're thinking,
"What the hell, Ally?

1172
01:13:38,810 --> 01:13:39,669
This is crazy."

1173
01:13:39,670 --> 01:13:41,343
And I know, believe me.

1174
01:13:44,760 --> 01:13:45,760
Michael?

1175
01:13:46,520 --> 01:13:47,520
Wake me up.

1176
01:13:49,700 --> 01:13:50,700
What?

1177
01:13:51,520 --> 01:13:52,970
Wake me up from this dream.

1178
01:13:56,118 --> 01:13:58,490
This can't be real.

1179
01:13:58,491 --> 01:14:01,054
Tell me it's not real.

1180
01:14:01,055 --> 01:14:02,624
What's the matter with you?

1181
01:14:02,625 --> 01:14:05,458
That is the thing from my dream.

1182
01:14:13,472 --> 01:14:14,972
What do you see?

1183
01:14:16,209 --> 01:14:17,464
Michael?

1184
01:14:17,465 --> 01:14:20,699
(Michael panting)

1185
01:14:20,700 --> 01:14:23,280
It has no eyes, yet it stares at me.

1186
01:14:26,989 --> 01:14:27,989
Why!

1187
01:14:30,784 --> 01:14:33,451
(ominous music)

1188
01:14:43,292 --> 01:14:44,292
You.

1189
01:14:47,383 --> 01:14:48,893
Why do you have eyes?

1190
01:14:51,180 --> 01:14:52,863
Why don't I see what he sees?

1191
01:14:54,440 --> 01:14:56,209
Leave him alone!

1192
01:14:56,210 --> 01:14:57,876
You want me?

1193
01:14:57,877 --> 01:14:59,074
Come and get me!

1194
01:14:59,075 --> 01:15:02,728
Show me what you really look like!

1195
01:15:02,729 --> 01:15:06,379
(light eerie music)

1196
01:15:06,380 --> 01:15:09,373
You'll see soon enough.

1197
01:15:18,730 --> 01:15:20,273
Come on outside, Ally.

1198
01:15:22,595 --> 01:15:24,678
The weather is fantastic.

1199
01:15:26,269 --> 01:15:28,852
(creepy music)

1200
01:15:31,792 --> 01:15:33,494
Hey, take this.

1201
01:15:33,495 --> 01:15:35,751
It's from Dr. Harris.

1202
01:15:35,752 --> 01:15:36,728
Let's just calm down.

1203
01:15:36,729 --> 01:15:38,896
We'll figure all this out.

1204
01:15:45,028 --> 01:15:46,107
It's okay.

1205
01:15:46,108 --> 01:15:47,533
It's okay.

1206
01:15:47,534 --> 01:15:50,784
(light dramatic music)

1207
01:16:09,388 --> 01:16:14,388
♪ I dream of earthquakes and you ♪

1208
01:16:15,086 --> 01:16:18,253
♪ I dream of a world- ♪

1209
01:16:19,204 --> 01:16:22,019
(static buzzing)

1210
01:16:22,020 --> 01:16:23,759
[Samantha] I wanted to ask you more

1211
01:16:23,760 --> 01:16:25,263
about the things I see.

1212
01:16:26,627 --> 01:16:28,649
[Jan] I want to ask you something too.

1213
01:16:28,650 --> 01:16:31,299
Last time we talked about whether or not

1214
01:16:31,300 --> 01:16:32,750
your mother really loved you.

1215
01:16:33,640 --> 01:16:35,659
Perhaps she was faking it.

1216
01:16:35,660 --> 01:16:37,199
Do you still feel that way?

1217
01:16:37,200 --> 01:16:38,169
[Samantha] But I need to understand

1218
01:16:38,170 --> 01:16:39,019
what's happening to me.

1219
01:16:39,020 --> 01:16:41,620
[Jan] And I want to talk
to you about your mother.

1220
01:16:42,780 --> 01:16:44,513
She's not a good mother, is she?

1221
01:16:45,610 --> 01:16:48,029
[Samantha] I don't like the
way I feel when I'm with you.

1222
01:16:48,030 --> 01:16:49,069
We're done.

1223
01:16:49,070 --> 01:16:54,070
[Jan] But you need my help
or else the Ubuso will get you.

1224
01:16:54,390 --> 01:16:55,969
[Samantha] It's real?

1225
01:16:55,970 --> 01:16:57,770
I thought it was just a ghost story.

1226
01:16:58,648 --> 01:17:00,109
[Jan] Where did you
get that bottle of water

1227
01:17:00,110 --> 01:17:02,059
you're drinking right now?

1228
01:17:02,060 --> 01:17:03,479
[Samantha] You gave it to me.

1229
01:17:03,480 --> 01:17:05,480
[Jan] You seem pretty sure about that.

1230
01:17:06,445 --> 01:17:09,453
But actually you got it
out of the fridge yourself.

1231
01:17:10,836 --> 01:17:13,783
The Ubuso can manipulate
reality anyway it sees fit.

1232
01:17:14,880 --> 01:17:18,129
It can answer phones and ring doorbells.

1233
01:17:18,130 --> 01:17:21,279
It can take the form of
your friends and loved ones.

1234
01:17:21,280 --> 01:17:23,989
It can have the walls close in on you.

1235
01:17:23,990 --> 01:17:26,169
Make you afraid to walk outside.

1236
01:17:26,170 --> 01:17:27,569
Drive you insane.

1237
01:17:27,570 --> 01:17:29,783
It is your God now.

1238
01:17:31,540 --> 01:17:36,311
It can even make this tape
you're listening to, Ally.

1239
01:17:36,312 --> 01:17:39,312
(suspenseful music)

1240
01:17:44,728 --> 01:17:48,811
We don't know, it could
chase us in our dreams.

1241
01:17:51,770 --> 01:17:54,899
(Ally panting)

1242
01:17:54,900 --> 01:17:57,297
Can't kill ourselves if we're asleep.

1243
01:18:13,370 --> 01:18:16,453
(headboard rattling)

1244
01:18:19,200 --> 01:18:20,203
[Michael] I'm sorry.

1245
01:18:22,546 --> 01:18:24,046
Did you do this?

1246
01:18:25,883 --> 01:18:27,433
It's so you wouldn't stop me.

1247
01:18:28,846 --> 01:18:30,679
Michael, cut it out.

1248
01:18:33,238 --> 01:18:34,488
I see it now.

1249
01:18:36,218 --> 01:18:37,218
Both of us.

1250
01:18:40,639 --> 01:18:42,806
We're crazy just like Sam.

1251
01:18:44,258 --> 01:18:47,258
(light eerie music)

1252
01:18:57,602 --> 01:18:59,352
What are you doing?

1253
01:19:01,178 --> 01:19:03,095
Why do you have this?

1254
01:19:05,719 --> 01:19:09,537
(Michael sniffling)

1255
01:19:09,538 --> 01:19:11,955
Where'd you even get it from?

1256
01:19:15,103 --> 01:19:17,563
Nothing good comes from having this.

1257
01:19:19,809 --> 01:19:22,809
(light eerie music)

1258
01:19:24,762 --> 01:19:27,069
Michael, it's nothing.

1259
01:19:27,070 --> 01:19:28,369
Don't listen to it.

1260
01:19:28,370 --> 01:19:29,710
It wants us to die.

1261
01:19:29,711 --> 01:19:34,711
Don't you understand?
(Michael hushes)

1262
01:19:38,074 --> 01:19:40,657
I tried so hard to be strong.

1263
01:19:48,194 --> 01:19:50,277
It was never easy for me.

1264
01:19:52,343 --> 01:19:54,260
Why can't you see that?

1265
01:19:55,290 --> 01:19:58,499
(suspenseful music)

1266
01:19:58,500 --> 01:20:01,625
Michael, we're doing fine.

1267
01:20:01,626 --> 01:20:02,626
Just fine.

1268
01:20:03,463 --> 01:20:04,630
Don't do this.

1269
01:20:05,487 --> 01:20:06,426
- We can get through this.
- No.

1270
01:20:06,427 --> 01:20:07,427
You hear me?

1271
01:20:09,930 --> 01:20:11,403
All we can do is end it.

1272
01:20:13,520 --> 01:20:14,520
Don't say that.

1273
01:20:15,381 --> 01:20:20,381
(Ally panting)
(ominous music)

1274
01:20:24,809 --> 01:20:26,809
Michael, snap out of it.

1275
01:20:30,242 --> 01:20:32,742
(Ally crying)

1276
01:20:33,641 --> 01:20:36,224
(Ally panting)

1277
01:20:38,978 --> 01:20:43,395
All I ever wanted was for
you to give me your love.

1278
01:20:48,761 --> 01:20:53,761
(Ally gasps)
(suspenseful music)

1279
01:20:58,450 --> 01:20:59,450
Michael.

1280
01:21:01,331 --> 01:21:04,236
(flesh squishing)

1281
01:21:04,237 --> 01:21:06,654
(crying) No!

1282
01:21:09,309 --> 01:21:10,309
Michael!

1283
01:21:14,130 --> 01:21:16,027
Michael, say something.

1284
01:21:18,711 --> 01:21:20,628
Michael, say something!

1285
01:21:25,158 --> 01:21:26,158
Oh, Michael.

1286
01:21:30,021 --> 01:21:31,021
Take me.

1287
01:21:33,043 --> 01:21:35,816
Take me, take me, take me.

1288
01:21:35,817 --> 01:21:36,984
Give him back.

1289
01:21:39,317 --> 01:21:42,900
Take me, take me (crying).

1290
01:21:47,545 --> 01:21:48,545
Michael.

1291
01:21:49,507 --> 01:21:52,007
(Ally crying)

1292
01:22:08,087 --> 01:22:09,670
You took my family.

1293
01:22:12,753 --> 01:22:14,336
You took my family!

1294
01:22:18,959 --> 01:22:19,959
Fuck you.

1295
01:22:20,651 --> 01:22:22,211
Fuck you!

1296
01:22:22,212 --> 01:22:23,212
Fuck you!

1297
01:22:24,333 --> 01:22:25,916
You took my family!

1298
01:22:27,437 --> 01:22:29,902
(Ally crying)

1299
01:22:29,903 --> 01:22:32,486
(Ally panting)

1300
01:22:55,793 --> 01:22:59,126
(sliding door rattling)

1301
01:23:00,224 --> 01:23:05,224
(Ally crying)
(sliding door slamming)

1302
01:23:05,922 --> 01:23:06,922
Pathetic.

1303
01:23:08,400 --> 01:23:12,520
After everything, you'd still
rather stay in here with me

1304
01:23:13,600 --> 01:23:14,693
than go out there.

1305
01:23:18,600 --> 01:23:19,633
I told you before.

1306
01:23:21,390 --> 01:23:22,493
You want my eyes?

1307
01:23:24,030 --> 01:23:25,693
Come and cut 'em out yourself.

1308
01:23:27,829 --> 01:23:31,329
(dramatic music)

1309
01:23:31,330 --> 01:23:32,370
Don't you know?

1310
01:23:33,450 --> 01:23:35,647
I am your God now.

1311
01:23:38,278 --> 01:23:40,547
(gentle ethereal music)

1312
01:23:40,548 --> 01:23:43,131
(Ally panting)

1313
01:23:46,643 --> 01:23:47,643
You.

1314
01:23:49,844 --> 01:23:52,761
I thought you were one of the same.

1315
01:23:53,670 --> 01:23:54,670
Fuck off!

1316
01:23:57,973 --> 01:24:00,390
You mock me with her words?

1317
01:24:03,992 --> 01:24:05,723
Did you hear me?

1318
01:24:08,570 --> 01:24:09,519
That's right.

1319
01:24:09,520 --> 01:24:12,220
Look at me when I'm talking
to you, you fuckin' bitch.

1320
01:24:13,130 --> 01:24:16,493
I already told you, come
cut them out yourself.

1321
01:24:19,128 --> 01:24:20,878
You're against her?

1322
01:24:22,427 --> 01:24:23,594
You're scared.

1323
01:24:25,626 --> 01:24:26,626
Who are you?

1324
01:24:28,317 --> 01:24:30,864
(muffled whispers)

1325
01:24:30,865 --> 01:24:34,614
- Enough!
- (dramatic music)

1326
01:24:34,615 --> 01:24:36,448
He can't help you now.

1327
01:24:42,775 --> 01:24:46,692
This is where you die,
just like your daughter.

1328
01:24:48,213 --> 01:24:51,213
(suspenseful music)

1329
01:24:57,145 --> 01:25:00,228
(distorted whispers)

1330
01:25:23,753 --> 01:25:26,529
[Ubuso] None of this is real.

1331
01:25:26,530 --> 01:25:28,579
Don't you recognize yourself?

1332
01:25:28,580 --> 01:25:30,009
This is a trick.

1333
01:25:30,010 --> 01:25:32,423
[Ubuso] Yes, because
you're imagining it.

1334
01:25:34,350 --> 01:25:37,359
You're the voice inside
my head that won't let go.

1335
01:25:37,360 --> 01:25:40,513
I see the most terrible things
because you believe in them.

1336
01:25:41,690 --> 01:25:43,163
There is no evil spirit.

1337
01:25:44,420 --> 01:25:47,379
You've trapped us in a nightmare.

1338
01:25:47,380 --> 01:25:49,163
You need to finally let go.

1339
01:25:50,140 --> 01:25:51,140
Free us.

1340
01:25:52,150 --> 01:25:53,999
It's time to wake up!

1341
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:55,000
How?

1342
01:25:56,270 --> 01:26:00,358
Give me your fucking eyes!

1343
01:26:00,359 --> 01:26:03,684
(Ubuso screaming)
(intense dramatic music)

1344
01:26:03,685 --> 01:26:08,685
(Ubuso growling)
(door creaking)

1345
01:26:10,921 --> 01:26:14,232
(tool thudding)
(Ubuso groaning)

1346
01:26:14,233 --> 01:26:16,092
(Ubuso growling)

1347
01:26:16,093 --> 01:26:18,760
(door slamming)

1348
01:26:21,030 --> 01:26:24,030
(light eerie music)

1349
01:26:25,893 --> 01:26:28,500
[Samantha] Mom, help me.

1350
01:26:28,501 --> 01:26:29,501
Help me!

1351
01:26:32,373 --> 01:26:35,012
Why didn't you help me?

1352
01:26:35,013 --> 01:26:37,482
You're not my daughter.

1353
01:26:37,483 --> 01:26:39,343
- You're not real.
- Real?

1354
01:26:40,790 --> 01:26:42,390
You'll never know what's real.

1355
01:26:43,261 --> 01:26:44,261
Never again.

1356
01:26:45,858 --> 01:26:47,913
Don't you want it to stop?

1357
01:26:47,914 --> 01:26:50,069
No!

1358
01:26:50,070 --> 01:26:53,237
(door latch clicking)

1359
01:26:56,265 --> 01:26:57,282
(door slamming)

1360
01:26:57,283 --> 01:26:59,233
Easy, Ally.

1361
01:26:59,234 --> 01:27:00,409
What are you doing?

1362
01:27:00,410 --> 01:27:01,410
Stop it.

1363
01:27:02,689 --> 01:27:04,182
I know it's you.

1364
01:27:04,183 --> 01:27:07,285
Yeah, it's me, your husband.

1365
01:27:07,286 --> 01:27:08,286
I saw you die.

1366
01:27:09,370 --> 01:27:10,819
What are you talking about?

1367
01:27:10,820 --> 01:27:12,020
I'm standing right here.

1368
01:27:13,530 --> 01:27:14,530
Put the bat down.

1369
01:27:16,200 --> 01:27:19,249
Look, this whole thing's been
rough on both of us, okay?

1370
01:27:19,250 --> 01:27:20,250
Sweetheart.

1371
01:27:21,320 --> 01:27:23,949
Do you remember what you
said to me at our wedding?

1372
01:27:23,950 --> 01:27:25,512
Of course.

1373
01:27:25,513 --> 01:27:27,049
That you're batting
1,000 when you're with me.

1374
01:27:27,050 --> 01:27:29,023
I'm batting 1,000 when I'm with you.

1375
01:27:30,474 --> 01:27:32,960
I remember it like it was yesterday.

1376
01:27:32,961 --> 01:27:33,961
It is you.

1377
01:27:35,381 --> 01:27:36,213
Come here.

1378
01:27:36,214 --> 01:27:38,049
I'm ridiculous, I'm sorry.

1379
01:27:38,050 --> 01:27:39,449
It's okay, baby.

1380
01:27:39,450 --> 01:27:41,529
It's okay, you can
tell me I'm ridiculous.

1381
01:27:41,530 --> 01:27:43,429
(both laughing)

1382
01:27:43,430 --> 01:27:44,430
You're ridiculous.

1383
01:27:46,042 --> 01:27:48,625
(gentle music)

1384
01:27:56,305 --> 01:27:59,041
I can't fight anymore.

1385
01:27:59,042 --> 01:28:01,459
You don't have to.

1386
01:28:01,460 --> 01:28:05,613
Everything you're feeling
right now, just accept it.

1387
01:28:09,438 --> 01:28:10,638
Let it flow through you.

1388
01:28:22,010 --> 01:28:23,373
This is what you want?

1389
01:28:24,454 --> 01:28:25,537
I love you.

1390
01:28:30,400 --> 01:28:32,460
I told her how you steal eyes.

1391
01:28:37,039 --> 01:28:37,909
What?

1392
01:28:37,910 --> 01:28:40,209
Memories are powerful things.

1393
01:28:40,210 --> 01:28:43,359
Find a good one, a symbol, and
suddenly an ordinary object

1394
01:28:43,360 --> 01:28:46,286
can be used as a weapon to
destroy the Ubuso forever.

1395
01:28:46,287 --> 01:28:49,287
(light eerie music)

1396
01:28:55,627 --> 01:28:58,286
Did you forget that I
could change faces too?

1397
01:28:58,287 --> 01:28:59,819
But that doesn't happen.

1398
01:28:59,820 --> 01:29:01,529
But it does.

1399
01:29:01,530 --> 01:29:04,643
Sometimes I get their voice,
but sometimes they listen.

1400
01:29:06,590 --> 01:29:07,890
And I get their ears, too.

1401
01:29:11,003 --> 01:29:14,086
(dramatic crackling)

1402
01:29:17,395 --> 01:29:19,562
She knows your secret now.

1403
01:29:20,584 --> 01:29:23,179
(suspenseful music)

1404
01:29:23,180 --> 01:29:28,180
(Ally grunting)
(bat thudding)

1405
01:29:30,520 --> 01:29:31,907
You took my family.

1406
01:29:33,828 --> 01:29:36,578
I won't let you take anyone else.

1407
01:29:37,679 --> 01:29:39,162
I have purpose.

1408
01:29:39,163 --> 01:29:41,550
(dramatic music)

1409
01:29:41,551 --> 01:29:43,090
(bat thudding)
(Jan screaming)

1410
01:29:43,091 --> 01:29:48,091

1411
01:29:54,091 --> 01:29:56,841

1412

(Ally panting)

1414
01:30:05,373 --> 01:30:07,049
Seven P's, honey:

1415
01:30:07,050 --> 01:30:10,063
Proper prior planning prevents
piss poor performance.

1416
01:30:11,700 --> 01:30:12,700
Samantha?

1417
01:30:13,540 --> 01:30:16,949
No, I met her though.

1418
01:30:16,950 --> 01:30:17,950
She's okay.

1419
01:30:18,920 --> 01:30:20,370
And she wants you to be okay.

1420
01:30:22,551 --> 01:30:24,051
You'll meet her again one day.

1421
01:30:25,565 --> 01:30:26,715
It's not your time yet.

1422
01:30:28,320 --> 01:30:30,737

1423
01:30:41,235 --> 01:30:46,235

01:30:47,575 --> 01:30:52,575

Here we go.
