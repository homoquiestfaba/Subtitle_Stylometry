1
00:01:25,631 --> 00:01:28,425
Yesterday, my son was playing...

2
00:01:28,801 --> 00:01:31,053
Going through the crates
for a piece of fruit...

3
00:01:31,762 --> 00:01:33,764
One of the packages was open,
a small tear...

4
00:01:34,515 --> 00:01:37,268
He nearly died in his mother's arms...

5
00:01:37,393 --> 00:01:40,813
from this poison you've asked me to hide.

6
00:01:41,898 --> 00:01:46,152
We will forget what we have seen.

7
00:01:46,194 --> 00:01:48,989
This act of mercy will bring
no threat to your honor.

8
00:02:03,587 --> 00:02:07,424
Next time, don't make an
agreement you cannot fulfill.

9
00:02:07,424 --> 00:02:09,969
Man, you are so tight. You're wound up.

10
00:02:24,818 --> 00:02:29,739
Sorry, I said, "Next time."
What I meant was next life.

11
00:02:47,258 --> 00:02:49,093
My apologies, Mrs. Kim.

12
00:02:49,677 --> 00:02:54,056
Maybe, in your next life,
choose your husbands more wisely.

13
00:03:22,878 --> 00:03:24,296
Go on. Go on. Go on!

14
00:03:33,639 --> 00:03:34,932
Your time is up!

15
00:03:52,868 --> 00:03:55,495
Jazz man... so it is you...

16
00:03:56,079 --> 00:03:57,497
Long time no see.

17
00:04:06,924 --> 00:04:09,885
It is you whose time is up...

18
00:04:18,561 --> 00:04:20,897
We agreed. No women! No children!

19
00:04:43,045 --> 00:04:45,214
Let the Lord have you, sister.

20
00:04:46,882 --> 00:04:49,593
Look, your family is waiting for you, kid.

21
00:04:51,804 --> 00:04:55,349
I'm gonna be out of here in one minute,
and then you'll be with them again.

22
00:04:56,392 --> 00:04:59,645
I know you don't understand
what I'm talking about.

23
00:05:13,034 --> 00:05:15,495
God forgive me for saving your life.

24
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:33,973
You're on your own in this world,

25
00:05:34,390 --> 00:05:36,559
and you gotta learn
to handle it on your own.

26
00:05:37,351 --> 00:05:39,479
I ain't no fit parent, no way.

27
00:05:42,607 --> 00:05:46,945
- How did my real mom and dad die?
- In a gang fight.

28
00:05:48,947 --> 00:05:51,366
Caught in the crossfire. Innocent.

29
00:05:53,076 --> 00:05:56,413
It was your old man's dying wish
that I look after you.

30
00:05:58,749 --> 00:06:03,087
That's the way the cards are dealt, Chance.
Ain't nothing you can do about it.

31
00:06:09,135 --> 00:06:14,849
See, him, his mom up and died.
I didn't have no choice.

32
00:06:18,770 --> 00:06:22,023
Max "Coolbreeze" Templeton
ain't no charity case.

33
00:06:23,399 --> 00:06:24,609
No, sir.

34
00:06:44,672 --> 00:06:45,965
Do as I do.

35
00:07:15,954 --> 00:07:18,916
Didn't I tell you
to stay the hell out of my goddamn den?

36
00:07:20,292 --> 00:07:21,251
Murder.

37
00:07:22,294 --> 00:07:23,754
Get out of here.

38
00:07:26,674 --> 00:07:28,676
Nigga, what you got to say?

39
00:07:31,011 --> 00:07:32,138
Cool.

40
00:07:35,266 --> 00:07:36,559
Get out of here.

41
00:07:37,643 --> 00:07:38,644
Move it.

42
00:07:52,117 --> 00:07:57,164
Now, you walk through this door,
and you're in hell with nowhere to turn back.

43
00:08:12,388 --> 00:08:14,098
Welcome to purgatory.

44
00:08:23,191 --> 00:08:25,860
- You think you can fight?
- You're damn right.

45
00:08:27,278 --> 00:08:30,031
All right. Kick my ass.

46
00:08:50,261 --> 00:08:52,972
See, the reason you can't hit me,
'cause you ain't feeling my rhythm.

47
00:08:53,097 --> 00:08:56,225
I could bust you up all day,
'cause you ain't kicking no rhythm.

48
00:08:58,519 --> 00:09:00,688
In life, it's all about the flow.

49
00:09:03,358 --> 00:09:06,611
Find your rhythm and you'll be unstoppable.

50
00:10:00,709 --> 00:10:03,545
2 more things you're gonna have to learn,

51
00:10:03,629 --> 00:10:05,839
the hardest 2 things
about our profession.

52
00:10:07,091 --> 00:10:08,425
What's that?

53
00:10:09,510 --> 00:10:11,303
Shooting a man for the first time

54
00:10:14,348 --> 00:10:16,058
and being shot the first time.

55
00:10:17,101 --> 00:10:19,020
What if I don't get shot?

56
00:10:24,692 --> 00:10:26,069
There you go.

57
00:10:32,117 --> 00:10:34,369
Come on, let's clean that up.

58
00:12:29,864 --> 00:12:31,032
Call, sir.

59
00:12:54,473 --> 00:12:56,684
I'll take it all, the first shot.

60
00:12:57,894 --> 00:12:59,103
You ready?

61
00:13:01,981 --> 00:13:03,149
Cheers.

62
00:13:14,619 --> 00:13:17,456
I like the tattoos. This, this...

63
00:14:20,396 --> 00:14:21,773
God damn you.

64
00:14:22,315 --> 00:14:24,484
God doesn't care about people like us.

65
00:15:16,496 --> 00:15:18,081
Yo, Chance. What's up, man?

66
00:15:18,123 --> 00:15:21,668
Yo, I'm calling to find out how you like
that new track I blessed you with, man.

67
00:15:21,710 --> 00:15:24,505
Yo, call me when you get a minute, man.

68
00:15:24,588 --> 00:15:27,883
And make sure
you get all my gear back this time, all right?

69
00:15:27,925 --> 00:15:31,971
No scratches, please. Yo, call me, man.
All right.

70
00:16:19,604 --> 00:16:24,859
Him, his mom up and died.
I didn't have no choice.

71
00:16:26,277 --> 00:16:30,073
That's the way the cards are dealt, Chance.
Ain't nothing you can do about it.

72
00:16:40,751 --> 00:16:42,336
- Yo.
- This track is scratched.

73
00:16:42,461 --> 00:16:44,421
- What?
- The groove is off.

74
00:16:44,505 --> 00:16:46,382
You freestyled
to way harder grooves than this, man.

75
00:16:46,465 --> 00:16:47,591
You can do this one in your sleep.

76
00:16:47,758 --> 00:16:48,884
You got to lay down a new beat.

77
00:16:48,926 --> 00:16:51,846
Dude, you know how much
we're getting paid for this beat? It's done.

78
00:16:51,887 --> 00:16:54,348
- I'm off it. It's personal.
- Oh, jeez.

79
00:17:00,271 --> 00:17:02,941
- This is it. This is Angel's Merc.
- Right.

80
00:17:02,982 --> 00:17:05,318
Now, when I'm ready,
you put the window through.

81
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:07,570
I want a good shot of her
looking really angry.

82
00:17:07,654 --> 00:17:09,489
- All right.
- Relax.

83
00:17:10,073 --> 00:17:12,450
For Christ sakes,
you're getting 500 big ones for this.

84
00:17:12,492 --> 00:17:14,953
All right, fellows. Time to go.
You're trespassing.

85
00:17:15,078 --> 00:17:17,247
Piss off. Speak to Lenny.

86
00:17:27,299 --> 00:17:29,718
God damn it.

87
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:32,930
- Is everything cool?
- He just needs to walk it off.

88
00:17:34,181 --> 00:17:36,559
- It's good to see you, Miles.
- Anytime, every time.

89
00:17:36,601 --> 00:17:38,186
Matt, this is Ty.

90
00:17:38,269 --> 00:17:42,398
Ty. I'm sure Miles has told you about
some of the concerns we've been having,

91
00:17:42,482 --> 00:17:44,234
and I've got a lot of them.

92
00:17:44,317 --> 00:17:47,404
Let me just say that
Ty is the perfect liaison for this job.

93
00:17:47,487 --> 00:17:49,155
He knows the people,
understands the culture,

94
00:17:49,239 --> 00:17:51,283
speaks the language and knows protocol.

95
00:17:51,366 --> 00:17:53,451
As far as Angel being safe is concerned,

96
00:17:53,493 --> 00:17:56,496
I give you my word,
and my word goes a long way.

97
00:17:57,372 --> 00:17:58,624
That's why we got you here, Miles.

98
00:17:58,707 --> 00:18:01,376
- Knock it out the block.
- I intend to.

99
00:18:01,460 --> 00:18:05,089
I've never had a package fall, never.
Angel won't be the first.

100
00:18:05,172 --> 00:18:09,593
It's like I always say, I'd put myself down
before I let a client come to harm.

101
00:18:26,236 --> 00:18:29,614
Stop. No. No. Come here.

102
00:18:31,116 --> 00:18:33,535
You serious? You serious?

103
00:18:35,495 --> 00:18:39,625
We've been working for 11 hours straight
and still making the same mistakes, Tamara.

104
00:18:39,625 --> 00:18:43,629
This is not my first album.
The vocals need to be here.

105
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:47,800
Tamara, I know
you have more in you than this.

106
00:18:50,219 --> 00:18:51,887
Take 5 and come back and show me.

107
00:18:52,012 --> 00:18:54,974
Angel, I really need you
to make a final decision on an outfit.

108
00:18:56,142 --> 00:18:58,144
Everyone hates the album.

109
00:18:58,895 --> 00:19:01,314
- What, your album?
- No, The Beatles.

110
00:19:02,190 --> 00:19:05,193
- Yeah, my album.
- No one hates it.

111
00:19:05,276 --> 00:19:07,362
Then why hasn't anyone bought it yet?

112
00:19:07,487 --> 00:19:11,283
I don't know that, you know,
but I know it takes time.

113
00:19:11,324 --> 00:19:14,661
You put out something
that people weren't expecting.

114
00:19:14,745 --> 00:19:16,496
Yeah, I did.

115
00:19:17,706 --> 00:19:23,045
I put myself out there, Matt.
This album is me.

116
00:19:23,128 --> 00:19:27,550
It's all of my heart, and it's echoes of things
that I've given up to get to where I am.

117
00:19:28,968 --> 00:19:31,929
Parts of me
that I'm just never gonna get back.

118
00:19:34,056 --> 00:19:36,684
Hey, Angel.

119
00:19:39,270 --> 00:19:40,146
Yeah.

120
00:19:40,688 --> 00:19:42,732
Trust your instincts.

121
00:19:50,115 --> 00:19:52,534
You're the only family I have, Matt.

122
00:19:55,662 --> 00:19:59,249
Get some sleep, kiddo. Tomorrow, Bangkok.

123
00:20:02,211 --> 00:20:04,213
- That's Japanese, Matt.
- Whatever.

124
00:20:04,254 --> 00:20:06,548
- Good night.
- Good night.

125
00:22:02,044 --> 00:22:05,255
Is that a pistol in your hand,
or are you just happy to see me?

126
00:22:07,841 --> 00:22:09,218
Remember him?

127
00:22:13,681 --> 00:22:16,517
Pretty good- looking boy, Miles is, ain't he?

128
00:22:18,978 --> 00:22:22,315
- Move again...
- Watch yourself, boy.

129
00:22:22,398 --> 00:22:24,400
Why did you lie to me?

130
00:22:24,526 --> 00:22:26,528
I need to use the bathroom.

131
00:22:38,290 --> 00:22:40,626
For 11 years, you said he was dead.

132
00:22:41,752 --> 00:22:44,254
You were better off
not knowing where he was.

133
00:22:44,338 --> 00:22:46,715
Who are you to decide?

134
00:22:46,757 --> 00:22:49,301
I've been making decisions for you
since you were a buck.

135
00:22:49,385 --> 00:22:52,221
You gave me a brother,
then you took him away.

136
00:22:54,015 --> 00:22:55,057
Why?

137
00:22:55,474 --> 00:22:56,517
Easy, Chance.

138
00:22:57,226 --> 00:22:58,561
Because you let me.

139
00:23:02,023 --> 00:23:05,235
You want to know
why I told you your brother was dead?

140
00:23:05,318 --> 00:23:07,737
Because I think he ain't like you and me.

141
00:23:07,779 --> 00:23:11,700
Miles is better off moving on with his life,
forgetting about us.

142
00:23:11,741 --> 00:23:15,829
You see, I think he's too stupid.
He got too much heart.

143
00:23:17,414 --> 00:23:19,166
He wrote you letters!

144
00:23:21,168 --> 00:23:23,420
I almost killed the fucking mailman

145
00:23:23,504 --> 00:23:26,632
because every day he had another letter
from Miles, trying to get in touch with you.

146
00:23:27,841 --> 00:23:29,260
Letting you think he was dead

147
00:23:29,301 --> 00:23:32,138
was the only way
I could get you to let him go.

148
00:23:34,307 --> 00:23:38,561
I didn't keep you from finding your brother.
I kept him from finding you.

149
00:23:47,654 --> 00:23:50,323
You're a stone- cold killer, just like me.

150
00:23:57,039 --> 00:24:01,418
Everything I am, you taught me.
Everything I did was to make you proud.

151
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:06,882
But now I know that I am nothing like you.

152
00:24:07,925 --> 00:24:12,430
I'm the man that made you.
I'm the cloth you're cut from!

153
00:24:16,726 --> 00:24:21,272
Now, you walk through this door,
and you're in hell with nowhere to turn back.

154
00:24:22,649 --> 00:24:24,484
Welcome to purgatory.

155
00:24:44,254 --> 00:24:46,215
Time for your last lesson.

156
00:24:47,174 --> 00:24:50,302
I ain't your old man no more. I can't be.

157
00:24:52,304 --> 00:24:54,307
You're in the life now.

158
00:24:54,390 --> 00:24:58,019
Time may come when you and
I may have to go heads- up. Dig it?

159
00:25:01,356 --> 00:25:02,774
Are you listening to me?

160
00:25:04,484 --> 00:25:07,278
This ain't no stage joke. This is the deal.

161
00:25:08,571 --> 00:25:10,156
Vietnam burned me out.

162
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:13,743
I ain't no good for nothing else but this,
but you're different.

163
00:25:13,827 --> 00:25:17,289
You've got a talent for it. You'll do all right.

164
00:25:21,543 --> 00:25:23,879
Ain't nothing else I can teach you.

165
00:25:25,673 --> 00:25:29,385
Just remember, don't get close to nobody.

166
00:25:31,429 --> 00:25:34,473
They'll just as easy replace you
as the other guy.

167
00:25:35,474 --> 00:25:37,435
I ain't got nothing else.

168
00:25:42,523 --> 00:25:44,025
See this locket?

169
00:25:46,611 --> 00:25:48,571
That's your real family.

170
00:25:50,282 --> 00:25:52,409
Wear it close to your heart.

171
00:25:52,492 --> 00:25:55,120
That's the only family you're gonna have
from here on.

172
00:25:59,041 --> 00:26:01,168
- Fat Rick's Rib Shack.
- Cise.

173
00:26:01,251 --> 00:26:02,586
Take your order.

174
00:26:02,669 --> 00:26:05,631
Now, your mother didn't teach you
to answer the phone like that, did she?

175
00:26:05,756 --> 00:26:07,550
I'm joking, dawg. Relax.

176
00:26:07,633 --> 00:26:10,344
Bangkok. Who's the new MC?

177
00:26:11,470 --> 00:26:15,057
Well, after you passed the mike,
they went to the next names on the A- list.

178
00:26:16,976 --> 00:26:22,649
But they must really want this girl butchered
because the new MC is a monster.

179
00:26:25,443 --> 00:26:27,278
And it ain't just one.

180
00:26:29,489 --> 00:26:31,575
It's a husband- and- wife team.

181
00:26:32,826 --> 00:26:35,871
They love killing
as much as they love each other.

182
00:26:36,913 --> 00:26:40,375
Paris, 2005, 60 dead, one target.

183
00:26:40,459 --> 00:26:44,922
London, 2001, whole city block,
gone, 2 targets.

184
00:26:47,633 --> 00:26:51,512
Know their code names?
Collateral and Damage.

185
00:26:52,847 --> 00:26:55,349
Bangkok better re- up on body bags.

186
00:27:27,174 --> 00:27:28,259
Good boy.

187
00:27:43,524 --> 00:27:45,735
Don't you love these moments?

188
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:13,723
Damn.

189
00:28:37,289 --> 00:28:39,541
- Did you sweep the windows?
- All around.

190
00:28:40,626 --> 00:28:43,003
- And the dressing rooms?
- Twice.

191
00:28:44,588 --> 00:28:48,217
- What about the restrooms?
- Miles, everything's been checked.

192
00:28:49,176 --> 00:28:50,845
What about the roof?

193
00:28:50,886 --> 00:28:54,223
I checked it earlier.
We'll have a guard up there tonight.

194
00:28:55,766 --> 00:29:00,355
I'll double- check it myself, and after that,
I want a man up there at all times.

195
00:29:00,438 --> 00:29:01,439
Okay.

196
00:29:59,207 --> 00:30:00,459
Chance!

197
00:30:02,961 --> 00:30:04,672
I can't believe this.

198
00:30:13,014 --> 00:30:14,932
What are you doing here, man?

199
00:30:16,017 --> 00:30:17,643
Did you get any of my letters?

200
00:30:19,771 --> 00:30:20,813
No.

201
00:30:24,025 --> 00:30:26,569
I didn't think he'd give them to you.

202
00:30:31,032 --> 00:30:32,325
How is Dad?

203
00:30:35,287 --> 00:30:36,455
Not good.

204
00:30:40,876 --> 00:30:44,004
Walk with me. You're getting faster, man.

205
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:50,010
Roof is secure. I'm coming down.

206
00:30:58,144 --> 00:31:00,980
When you're young,
ain't got no place to go,

207
00:31:00,980 --> 00:31:04,359
there's a lot you can get into,
none of it good.

208
00:31:05,610 --> 00:31:08,279
But, you know, you come up,
make a name for yourself.

209
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:11,700
To tell you to truth, I was jacked up.

210
00:31:14,953 --> 00:31:18,332
So as soon as I could
is when I joined the Marine Corps.

211
00:31:19,333 --> 00:31:22,085
Unlearned all that hustling crap real quick.

212
00:31:23,337 --> 00:31:27,925
When I got out, I joined the force, DC,
and SWAT.

213
00:31:28,008 --> 00:31:31,220
Then a friend of mine
turned me on to this whole security thing.

214
00:31:32,012 --> 00:31:34,181
And now here I am in Bangkok.

215
00:31:36,684 --> 00:31:40,646
Who would've thought it actually
feels better saving lives than taking them.

216
00:31:41,814 --> 00:31:44,317
We go where life takes us, Miles.

217
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:47,112
Maybe, but not always.

218
00:31:51,616 --> 00:31:55,078
- Look, man, I'm here for a reason.
- Yeah, I figured that.

219
00:31:55,829 --> 00:32:00,000
- Your client has a contract out on her.
- Really?

220
00:32:03,003 --> 00:32:09,635
We ain't kids no more, Chance. We're grown.
I ain't playing games. I'm a professional.

221
00:32:11,721 --> 00:32:13,514
You got any intel?

222
00:32:13,597 --> 00:32:15,558
Miles, you know what I do.

223
00:32:17,643 --> 00:32:19,145
This is serious.

224
00:32:19,187 --> 00:32:21,230
People are coming to Bangkok,
probably here right now,

225
00:32:21,230 --> 00:32:22,690
and they're coming to kill your singer.

226
00:32:22,815 --> 00:32:25,985
And they'll kill you or anybody else
who gets in the way to finish the job.

227
00:32:26,986 --> 00:32:32,075
Miles, I'm one of the best,
and I'm telling you, she's an easy mark.

228
00:32:32,784 --> 00:32:36,371
Any amateur can pull this off.
You get in the way, you're getting done, too.

229
00:32:37,122 --> 00:32:41,543
I know, because I'm the one
who got the contract first.

230
00:32:45,547 --> 00:32:49,009
So, what? Am I supposed to be scared,

231
00:32:49,093 --> 00:32:51,846
because you show up after all these years
talking about this junk?

232
00:32:52,805 --> 00:32:56,183
Don't get it twisted.
Scared got nothing to do with it.

233
00:32:56,225 --> 00:32:59,479
Just like I got you on the roof,
she can be got, too.

234
00:33:02,857 --> 00:33:05,693
You better check yourself, little brother.

235
00:33:06,611 --> 00:33:09,739
On the roof, you'd have got got.

236
00:33:10,907 --> 00:33:14,870
And know this, I'm one of the best.

237
00:33:15,912 --> 00:33:19,082
So if people are coming,
they'd better come strong,

238
00:33:19,958 --> 00:33:22,336
because I've got something for them.

239
00:33:23,128 --> 00:33:25,464
That would have included you, too.

240
00:33:26,298 --> 00:33:30,553
Miles, if I took this contract,
you would not have been able to stop me.

241
00:33:31,762 --> 00:33:35,182
If you took the contract,
I'd have to put you in a body bag!

242
00:33:38,686 --> 00:33:40,313
You know what, man?

243
00:33:42,273 --> 00:33:45,235
Why don't you get out of here.
Why don't you get?

244
00:33:46,402 --> 00:33:48,738
You're not helping the situation.

245
00:33:51,032 --> 00:33:54,578
You do you, I'm gonna do me.

246
00:34:27,070 --> 00:34:28,113
Get off...

247
00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:22,002
Do you have ID?

248
00:36:15,141 --> 00:36:17,852
- Okay, we ready?
- Let's do it.

249
00:36:17,935 --> 00:36:19,687
Let's do it! Come on.

250
00:38:12,054 --> 00:38:13,347
No, no, no.

251
00:39:04,651 --> 00:39:07,821
Is someone gonna tell me
what the hell just happened?

252
00:39:15,537 --> 00:39:18,165
Hey! Don't you two talk?

253
00:39:18,248 --> 00:39:20,500
Miles, tell your client to shut up.

254
00:39:21,502 --> 00:39:25,631
Excuse me? You don't talk to me like that.

255
00:39:25,673 --> 00:39:26,882
A, I wasn't talking to you.

256
00:39:26,966 --> 00:39:30,594
B, I'm not on the job,
and, C, you better stay in your place.

257
00:39:40,813 --> 00:39:42,774
- Where are we going?
- A safe spot.

258
00:39:47,779 --> 00:39:48,988
Watch out!

259
00:39:57,706 --> 00:39:59,082
Step on it!

260
00:40:12,763 --> 00:40:13,848
Down!

261
00:40:13,889 --> 00:40:15,558
- Faster, Chance!
- I got it.

262
00:40:48,759 --> 00:40:52,221
- Why was a cop shooting at us?
- That was no cop.

263
00:40:52,304 --> 00:40:55,349
- Who was it?
- There's a contract out for your life.

264
00:40:57,435 --> 00:40:58,519
Hey, can I have...

265
00:41:26,382 --> 00:41:28,717
Okay. Reality check, guys.

266
00:41:28,717 --> 00:41:31,762
I don't work for the government.
No one wants me dead.

267
00:41:31,804 --> 00:41:34,265
Take me back to my manager right now!

268
00:41:34,307 --> 00:41:35,850
You'll be dead by sunrise.

269
00:41:35,892 --> 00:41:37,894
Fine, then take me to the police.

270
00:41:37,935 --> 00:41:41,064
Can't take the risk
that the police are bought and paid for.

271
00:41:41,189 --> 00:41:44,067
- Why me?
- You're a nice paycheck.

272
00:41:44,067 --> 00:41:45,485
Stop here.

273
00:41:46,069 --> 00:41:47,445
Why are we stopping here?

274
00:41:47,612 --> 00:41:50,115
We are going to collect our minds.

275
00:41:50,198 --> 00:41:53,201
And then we're going to proceed
to the safe spot.

276
00:41:53,243 --> 00:41:55,036
Okay. Safe spot.

277
00:41:55,120 --> 00:41:57,122
Right. Great.

278
00:42:14,015 --> 00:42:17,226
Matt cared enough about you to hire me.

279
00:42:18,311 --> 00:42:21,856
I have a lot of experience
handling these situations.

280
00:42:23,483 --> 00:42:25,944
You're going to be okay. Trust me.

281
00:42:26,945 --> 00:42:28,947
I have a choice?

282
00:42:28,988 --> 00:42:32,826
It's my duty to get you home safe.
That's what I'm going to do.

283
00:42:36,663 --> 00:42:39,791
Here, Angel, why don't you sit down
and relax for a little while?

284
00:42:51,804 --> 00:42:53,639
Man, what are you doing?

285
00:43:01,773 --> 00:43:05,568
Praying, man.
We need all the help we can get.

286
00:43:06,653 --> 00:43:08,071
Whatever, man.

287
00:43:09,698 --> 00:43:12,784
You, more than most,
have a lot to be thankful for.

288
00:43:14,119 --> 00:43:16,037
Well, there you go, huh?

289
00:43:19,625 --> 00:43:21,877
You remember us playing as kids?

290
00:43:23,212 --> 00:43:25,214
I remember you used to play.

291
00:43:26,215 --> 00:43:28,259
I used to get my ass kicked.

292
00:43:29,218 --> 00:43:31,721
- I had your back.
- True.

293
00:43:32,763 --> 00:43:36,183
No matter who, you would serve them.

294
00:43:38,853 --> 00:43:40,730
I still have your back.

295
00:43:41,898 --> 00:43:44,025
I'm gonna always have your back.

296
00:43:45,276 --> 00:43:46,903
I hope you have my back, too.

297
00:43:46,986 --> 00:43:49,614
Then why'd you walk out on me and Pops?

298
00:43:52,826 --> 00:43:56,663
That was a different time, a different me.

299
00:43:58,165 --> 00:43:59,625
I'm a man now.

300
00:44:03,796 --> 00:44:05,339
I know you, man.

301
00:44:07,049 --> 00:44:08,717
I know what's in your heart.

302
00:44:09,051 --> 00:44:11,095
Since we were kids,

303
00:44:11,137 --> 00:44:15,182
you didn't have any choice
but to fall into the lifestyle you fell into.

304
00:44:15,266 --> 00:44:20,855
You trying to burn some incense for me,
take away all my sins?

305
00:44:21,898 --> 00:44:23,441
I can't do that.

306
00:44:24,692 --> 00:44:26,486
Only the big man can.

307
00:44:26,945 --> 00:44:28,571
I chose this life.

308
00:44:29,364 --> 00:44:33,201
Pops had a little something to do with it,
but he made me better for it.

309
00:44:33,326 --> 00:44:37,205
Taught me to be the best,
be a professional.

310
00:44:38,915 --> 00:44:42,169
I got no regrets,
and there's no turning back.

311
00:44:42,836 --> 00:44:46,173
I've done things, Miles,
things that can't be changed.

312
00:44:46,715 --> 00:44:50,302
My first job,
I was just this wingman to a merc.

313
00:44:50,928 --> 00:44:55,182
We had a target in the kitchen,
wife and kids lined up against the wall.

314
00:44:55,266 --> 00:44:58,311
All of a sudden,
this merc pops the whole family.

315
00:45:00,396 --> 00:45:02,482
The target had it coming.

316
00:45:04,526 --> 00:45:06,152
The wife and kids,

317
00:45:08,988 --> 00:45:11,241
it's like I killed them myself.

318
00:45:14,411 --> 00:45:17,664
Do you think I could
just burn some incense for that?

319
00:45:20,834 --> 00:45:23,587
You've broken the
5th commandment, Chance.

320
00:45:24,713 --> 00:45:26,048
You're not the first,

321
00:45:28,717 --> 00:45:30,052
you won't be the last.

322
00:45:33,222 --> 00:45:35,308
Will God forgive you for that?

323
00:45:37,018 --> 00:45:38,478
I don't know.

324
00:45:40,563 --> 00:45:41,856
But I do.

325
00:45:53,660 --> 00:45:54,911
Do as I do.

326
00:46:00,042 --> 00:46:01,460
Do as I do.

327
00:46:04,296 --> 00:46:05,547
Done.

328
00:46:05,589 --> 00:46:08,008
- Let's go, Angel.
- I'm coming.

329
00:46:10,344 --> 00:46:13,639
I need a pedicure and a manicure
as soon as I get back.

330
00:46:29,864 --> 00:46:33,660
I can't believe you got me here
in my dress and my heels.

331
00:46:37,331 --> 00:46:40,459
- What are we doing here, again?
- Window- shopping.

332
00:46:40,500 --> 00:46:42,085
Window- shopping.

333
00:46:47,174 --> 00:46:49,677
Hey, I've got to go to the bathroom.

334
00:46:50,261 --> 00:46:53,264
I really have to go. Please.

335
00:46:54,390 --> 00:46:55,808
You heard the lady.

336
00:46:55,808 --> 00:46:58,227
What, you don't want her
to get messy, do you?

337
00:46:58,269 --> 00:47:00,229
- Go.
- Easy.

338
00:47:02,899 --> 00:47:05,485
You know, he's a lot nicer than you are.

339
00:47:43,691 --> 00:47:46,986
You're so mean.
Would you stop pushing me?

340
00:47:52,492 --> 00:47:53,952
Go over there.

341
00:47:55,078 --> 00:47:57,289
May I have some privacy, please?

342
00:47:58,040 --> 00:47:59,416
Privacy.

343
00:47:59,458 --> 00:48:01,418
Please. Please.

344
00:48:10,469 --> 00:48:12,012
Now, you move.

345
00:48:47,549 --> 00:48:49,426
What are you looking at?

346
00:48:49,468 --> 00:48:50,678
The safety is on.

347
00:48:50,719 --> 00:48:56,183
That's bull. This is a Walther P22.
They have no safeties.

348
00:48:57,143 --> 00:48:58,603
Now that's impressive.

349
00:48:58,686 --> 00:49:02,899
Now wipe that smirk off your face.
I swear to God!

350
00:49:03,191 --> 00:49:05,777
Just take me back to my manager's hotel.

351
00:49:39,312 --> 00:49:41,939
Hey, look at me.

352
00:49:45,193 --> 00:49:46,820
Playtime is over.

353
00:49:49,823 --> 00:49:51,741
Don't move and stay down!

354
00:50:22,732 --> 00:50:23,733
No!

355
00:50:45,422 --> 00:50:47,675
Come on, man!

356
00:50:50,553 --> 00:50:51,762
Get up!

357
00:50:56,893 --> 00:50:59,896
No. No. No.

358
00:51:00,813 --> 00:51:04,984
No, God!

359
00:51:46,444 --> 00:51:47,529
Don't move.

360
00:51:47,529 --> 00:51:49,656
I wasn't going to say anything.

361
00:51:51,366 --> 00:51:54,077
- Where are we going now?
- I'm calling a friend.

362
00:51:54,828 --> 00:51:56,621
You actually have one?

363
00:52:01,001 --> 00:52:02,419
Cise.

364
00:52:02,461 --> 00:52:04,755
Yo. My God, what are you doing, man?

365
00:52:04,880 --> 00:52:05,881
I need a local.

366
00:52:06,006 --> 00:52:07,800
You haven't checked in,
in, like, 3 days, man.

367
00:52:07,841 --> 00:52:10,136
- What's your location?
- Bangkok.

368
00:52:10,136 --> 00:52:11,220
- Bangkok.
- This is bullshit.

369
00:52:11,262 --> 00:52:12,596
You know you're not
supposed to get involved...

370
00:52:12,722 --> 00:52:15,641
- A name, Cise, now!
- Okay. All right, all right, let me find it.

371
00:52:15,683 --> 00:52:18,060
- Give me a contact.
- I'm working on it, man.

372
00:52:18,144 --> 00:52:19,687
I need to gear up.

373
00:52:19,771 --> 00:52:23,274
DJ Renegade. He's got a gig spinning
at a place called Bangcocked.

374
00:52:23,316 --> 00:52:25,109
Yo, can you be safe out there, please?

375
00:52:25,151 --> 00:52:26,778
Thank you, brother.

376
00:52:29,155 --> 00:52:30,782
Let's move.

377
00:52:30,865 --> 00:52:32,200
Let's move.

378
00:52:58,686 --> 00:53:00,688
Hey, man. Let's go.

379
00:53:07,320 --> 00:53:10,198
You're making a lot of noise, brother.

380
00:53:10,198 --> 00:53:11,658
Sometimes it can't be helped.

381
00:53:11,658 --> 00:53:16,371
You're bringing a lot of heat to everybody.
I mean everybody.

382
00:53:17,748 --> 00:53:19,458
Come to the back room

383
00:53:33,222 --> 00:53:35,349
Take what you want and leave.

384
00:53:39,061 --> 00:53:40,938
I need a first- aid kit.

385
00:53:45,610 --> 00:53:48,113
We've identified the suspect
from last night's abduction...

386
00:53:48,154 --> 00:53:50,532
Consider this priority one.

387
00:53:50,573 --> 00:53:52,742
He's a cop killer.

388
00:54:07,049 --> 00:54:09,677
- What the hell's all this for?
- Don't worry about it.

389
00:54:09,718 --> 00:54:12,263
Don't worry about it. Who the hell are you?

390
00:54:12,388 --> 00:54:13,764
You're a damn whackjob is what you are.

391
00:54:13,806 --> 00:54:16,309
And where the hell's the other guy,
whatever the hell his name is.

392
00:54:16,350 --> 00:54:18,811
Miles Templeton, that's who he was.

393
00:54:18,853 --> 00:54:22,357
He died for you tonight,
and you didn't even know his name.

394
00:54:22,482 --> 00:54:25,568
- What are you talking about?
- I'm talking about my brother Miles.

395
00:54:25,610 --> 00:54:28,321
He took the hit
that had you written all over it.

396
00:54:28,405 --> 00:54:30,532
I didn't know.
I thought he was just a big screw- up.

397
00:54:30,657 --> 00:54:35,454
That's right, a big screw- up that took
my brother's life for a spoiled brat like you.

398
00:54:38,915 --> 00:54:41,793
Look, I don't know what's happening, okay?
I just... I came...

399
00:54:41,835 --> 00:54:44,046
That's right, you don't know.

400
00:54:44,505 --> 00:54:46,590
But you probably never thought
of anybody but yourself.

401
00:54:46,715 --> 00:54:48,926
Miles was always there for me.

402
00:54:48,968 --> 00:54:51,262
He's the only reason
why you're alive tonight,

403
00:54:51,345 --> 00:54:54,265
so keep your mouth shut
and do as you're told.

404
00:55:00,730 --> 00:55:01,773
God!

405
00:55:04,108 --> 00:55:05,109
Let me.

406
00:55:06,069 --> 00:55:07,904
Just relax.

407
00:55:08,697 --> 00:55:10,115
Let me get it.

408
00:55:18,957 --> 00:55:21,752
This is going to sting a little bit, okay?

409
00:55:46,027 --> 00:55:47,654
What do we do now?

410
00:55:51,575 --> 00:55:55,328
Miles had a plan, a safe spot.

411
00:55:57,372 --> 00:55:59,082
Gotta get you to it.

412
00:56:01,960 --> 00:56:03,003
Okay.

413
00:56:04,755 --> 00:56:05,839
Okay.

414
00:56:24,025 --> 00:56:26,528
Elders, I come to you with great respect...

415
00:56:26,569 --> 00:56:28,738
...and to seek your advice.

416
00:56:34,995 --> 00:56:40,250
Many of you have enlisted our services,
and you know we have never failed you.

417
00:56:42,503 --> 00:56:44,004
My love is dead.

418
00:56:46,048 --> 00:56:49,468
The man responsible for killing her
is the student of an enemy

419
00:56:49,593 --> 00:56:52,304
that I crossed blades with a long time ago.

420
00:56:54,015 --> 00:56:58,853
So this is now a matter of revenge
and of honor for me.

421
00:57:02,815 --> 00:57:06,653
I offer my fees for killing the girl
as compensation if you help.

422
00:57:25,506 --> 00:57:27,716
- Who the hell is it?
- Hey, old man.

423
00:57:29,218 --> 00:57:30,636
What the hell do you want?

424
00:57:30,678 --> 00:57:36,225
Your boy's all over the news.
It's Chance, he's fucked up big time.

425
00:57:36,851 --> 00:57:37,894
So what?

426
00:57:37,977 --> 00:57:41,731
Max, he's your boy. It's you or him.

427
00:57:42,607 --> 00:57:44,817
- Where is he?
- Bangkok.

428
00:58:18,603 --> 00:58:20,772
I just want to go home.

429
00:58:20,897 --> 00:58:22,398
Please, could you just...

430
00:58:22,482 --> 00:58:24,651
Could you just take me
back to my manager's now?

431
00:58:24,776 --> 00:58:25,944
Not yet.

432
00:58:35,412 --> 00:58:38,749
This is not about saving me.
You're not here to protect me.

433
00:58:38,832 --> 00:58:42,544
You're just... You're just using me.
You're just using me for bait.

434
00:58:42,669 --> 00:58:45,047
You want to hang with me
so that these guys can keep coming

435
00:58:45,047 --> 00:58:47,549
so that you can get
the guy responsible for killing Miles.

436
00:58:47,633 --> 00:58:49,051
That's exactly what you want.

437
00:58:49,134 --> 00:58:51,178
If I'd have taken you back,
you'd be dead, and so would they.

438
00:58:51,220 --> 00:58:53,723
I don't know if that would happen.

439
00:58:53,723 --> 00:58:54,974
I want to go home.

440
00:58:57,894 --> 00:59:01,189
I'm leaving.
You can just handle this your damn self.

441
00:59:01,898 --> 00:59:03,566
Don't go out there!

442
00:59:16,121 --> 00:59:17,330
Come on.

443
00:59:51,950 --> 00:59:53,159
Come on.

444
01:00:23,483 --> 01:00:27,362
Shut off your engine. Show your hands!

445
01:00:40,876 --> 01:00:43,295
We know you killed the officer
at the concert last night.

446
01:00:45,047 --> 01:00:47,049
I don't understand you, man.

447
01:00:49,885 --> 01:00:53,222
And you kidnapped the singer.

448
01:00:54,181 --> 01:00:57,476
You think you can do
whatever you want in Thailand?

449
01:00:59,187 --> 01:01:00,438
Enough!

450
01:01:03,983 --> 01:01:05,777
Let me handle this.

451
01:01:09,322 --> 01:01:11,283
He says you killed a cop.

452
01:01:14,286 --> 01:01:17,831
There's nothing in the world I hate more
than cop killers.

453
01:01:21,835 --> 01:01:24,880
Do you know what we do
to cop killers in Russia?

454
01:02:41,502 --> 01:02:44,213
Listen! You've got to get me out of here.

455
01:02:54,557 --> 01:02:56,309
Put him in the cell.

456
01:03:09,614 --> 01:03:11,157
I'm in. He's mine.

457
01:04:26,277 --> 01:04:27,654
We're out of here.

458
01:05:07,862 --> 01:05:10,073
Oh, my God. He's here. He's here!

459
01:05:51,032 --> 01:05:53,118
You're going to be safe now.

460
01:05:53,201 --> 01:05:54,494
I know.

461
01:05:55,620 --> 01:05:57,497
Why are you still crying?

462
01:06:06,507 --> 01:06:07,758
I was 14.

463
01:06:10,135 --> 01:06:13,013
I was 14, about to sign my first deal.

464
01:06:13,806 --> 01:06:17,185
And there was this guy, Sean.

465
01:06:18,853 --> 01:06:24,442
God, I was 14, you know?
He'd play his guitar and sing.

466
01:06:26,694 --> 01:06:29,364
One thing led to another, I got pregnant.

467
01:06:30,407 --> 01:06:35,704
And I found out pretty quick
that labels are afraid to sign

468
01:06:35,746 --> 01:06:40,542
a 14- year- old pregnant, unwed singer.

469
01:06:45,798 --> 01:06:47,633
I had to give up my baby.

470
01:06:49,510 --> 01:06:51,387
I had to give up my baby.

471
01:06:53,222 --> 01:06:55,474
I had to give up my baby.

472
01:07:07,112 --> 01:07:12,200
I just feel like everything I've done
has been for nothing.

473
01:07:19,458 --> 01:07:25,214
I've given up so many things
for this business, for my career.

474
01:07:26,548 --> 01:07:28,008
And for what?

475
01:07:30,803 --> 01:07:34,724
I lost the most important thing in my life
a long time ago.

476
01:08:01,877 --> 01:08:03,587
Time to get you home.

477
01:08:15,474 --> 01:08:19,312
Angel. Oh, my God. Thank God you're safe.

478
01:08:19,395 --> 01:08:23,358
I've been trying to get back to you all night.
It's been crazy out there.

479
01:08:23,399 --> 01:08:24,442
I know.

480
01:08:24,567 --> 01:08:27,570
Chance, this is Matt.

481
01:08:27,695 --> 01:08:29,948
Hey, we've got to get you checked out,
all right?

482
01:08:30,031 --> 01:08:31,449
I want to make sure you're... Come on.

483
01:08:31,491 --> 01:08:32,784
Come on!

484
01:08:34,452 --> 01:08:36,204
I'll be right there to check on you.

485
01:08:36,204 --> 01:08:38,457
Hey, no, no, no.
That was good work out there.

486
01:08:38,498 --> 01:08:41,335
I appreciate that, okay? Thank you.

487
01:08:41,376 --> 01:08:43,337
I want to pay you something.

488
01:08:43,378 --> 01:08:46,006
You speak English? I really appreciate it.

489
01:08:46,006 --> 01:08:47,341
Take this.

490
01:08:47,424 --> 01:08:50,135
It's good. Way to get her to the safe spots.

491
01:08:50,261 --> 01:08:54,056
If you ever need a bodyguard job,
security job, I'm going to call you, okay?

492
01:08:54,140 --> 01:08:57,727
I gotta go. I gotta check on her.
I gotta check on her.

493
01:09:03,232 --> 01:09:05,360
- Enjoy your stay.
- Thank you.

494
01:09:09,197 --> 01:09:10,782
Purpose of visit?

495
01:09:11,241 --> 01:09:14,161
- Cleaning.
- Excuse me, sir?

496
01:09:14,244 --> 01:09:16,705
Business, ma'am. Just business.

497
01:09:17,664 --> 01:09:19,666
- Welcome to Thailand.
- Thank you.

498
01:09:23,670 --> 01:09:25,964
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

499
01:09:27,967 --> 01:09:29,260
Where's Chance?

500
01:09:29,260 --> 01:09:31,887
Chance had to run a couple errands.

501
01:09:31,971 --> 01:09:35,016
I would like to introduce you
to your new bodyguard, however.

502
01:09:35,057 --> 01:09:36,142
What?

503
01:09:39,854 --> 01:09:41,105
Oh, my God.

504
01:09:43,191 --> 01:09:44,776
What's going on?

505
01:09:48,154 --> 01:09:49,531
You did this?

506
01:09:50,532 --> 01:09:54,995
Angel, so quick. Quick. Quick. Quick.

507
01:09:55,120 --> 01:09:56,621
- Why?
- Why?

508
01:09:56,705 --> 01:09:59,207
First of all, you put out
a garbage- ass album, Angel.

509
01:09:59,291 --> 01:10:00,709
- How can...
- Yes.

510
01:10:00,834 --> 01:10:04,922
"It echoed of things that are from my soul,
things that I can't get back..."

511
01:10:04,963 --> 01:10:07,591
Garbage, Angel. Garbage, all right?

512
01:10:07,675 --> 01:10:10,594
And it just needed the right PR push.

513
01:10:10,636 --> 01:10:11,679
What?

514
01:10:12,847 --> 01:10:15,266
I made a deal with Ominous Records.

515
01:10:15,433 --> 01:10:18,311
And, well, since I own the rights
to all your songs...

516
01:10:18,311 --> 01:10:19,604
- How could...
- ...and you have enough

517
01:10:19,687 --> 01:10:21,356
for about 6 albums, well...

518
01:10:21,356 --> 01:10:23,399
How could you do this to me?

519
01:10:25,360 --> 01:10:27,362
Angel, bottom line,

520
01:10:28,029 --> 01:10:30,991
you're worth more to me dead
than you are alive.

521
01:10:32,534 --> 01:10:34,452
It's all about the money for you?

522
01:10:34,578 --> 01:10:36,163
What else is there?

523
01:10:36,747 --> 01:10:38,290
Do your job!

524
01:10:38,332 --> 01:10:39,416
Okay.

525
01:10:51,971 --> 01:10:55,182
It's good. Way to get her to the safe spots.

526
01:11:04,734 --> 01:11:05,860
Angel.

527
01:11:07,070 --> 01:11:08,738
No. She's tied up.

528
01:11:08,822 --> 01:11:11,574
You killed my woman, now I got yours.

529
01:11:11,616 --> 01:11:13,618
- Come get her.
- Where? When?

530
01:11:15,245 --> 01:11:17,414
Your last so- called safe spot.

531
01:11:38,936 --> 01:11:40,897
Hello, Agent Luai.

532
01:11:40,980 --> 01:11:44,525
Where?

533
01:11:44,609 --> 01:11:45,985
Where?!

534
01:12:11,971 --> 01:12:14,390
What are you doing?

535
01:12:15,308 --> 01:12:18,144
We have some unfinished business,
you and me.

536
01:12:19,395 --> 01:12:20,563
Chance!

537
01:12:21,314 --> 01:12:24,108
Was that your brother
at the market, Chance?

538
01:12:24,400 --> 01:12:27,487
I know a lot more about you,
where you come from.

539
01:12:28,655 --> 01:12:31,950
Did the jazz man ever tell you
what happened to your parents?

540
01:12:32,033 --> 01:12:33,994
How you came to be his boy?

541
01:12:40,834 --> 01:12:42,920
Well, I blew your daddy away.

542
01:12:43,754 --> 01:12:45,714
Your mother,
I was debating what to do with her,

543
01:12:45,881 --> 01:12:49,301
until the jazz man shows up,
bullets start flying.

544
01:12:49,927 --> 01:12:52,138
Next thing you know, she's dead.

545
01:12:55,766 --> 01:12:58,936
You know what? It was all because of me.

546
01:13:06,736 --> 01:13:09,781
You shoot that gun, and we all die.

547
01:13:15,495 --> 01:13:16,913
That's cool.

548
01:13:18,498 --> 01:13:20,751
I plan on taking my time with you.

549
01:14:22,440 --> 01:14:25,443
In life, it's all about the flow.

550
01:14:25,985 --> 01:14:27,445
Find your rhythm.

551
01:15:50,782 --> 01:15:53,034
Get the hell away from him!

552
01:15:54,494 --> 01:15:55,662
No.

553
01:15:57,164 --> 01:15:58,248
Shit.

554
01:16:21,481 --> 01:16:22,815
Are you all right?

555
01:16:22,940 --> 01:16:24,609
We're out of here.

556
01:16:40,667 --> 01:16:43,670
- You got to leave.
- No, no. I don't want to go.

557
01:16:43,796 --> 01:16:45,923
- You've got to leave now.
- No, I'm not leaving without you.

558
01:16:45,964 --> 01:16:48,676
- Listen to me!
- I'm not going to go without you, no!

559
01:16:48,759 --> 01:16:51,470
- Angel!
- No! No!

560
01:16:52,763 --> 01:16:55,725
You saved me in more ways
than you'll ever know.

561
01:17:07,445 --> 01:17:08,780
Thank you.

562
01:17:58,248 --> 01:18:01,752
There's nobody in here
but a squirrel trying to get a nut!

563
01:18:03,462 --> 01:18:04,880
Who are you?

564
01:18:07,174 --> 01:18:08,467
A musician.

565
01:18:10,094 --> 01:18:12,138
I'm here to play my last tune.

566
01:18:14,056 --> 01:18:15,850
Put the gun down.

567
01:18:15,933 --> 01:18:19,270
Put my weapon down? Nigga, please.

568
01:18:34,953 --> 01:18:38,415
For the love of God, man,
put the gun down!

569
01:18:38,999 --> 01:18:39,917
Man,

570
01:18:41,460 --> 01:18:43,128
what does God got to do with it?

571
01:19:07,237 --> 01:19:10,198
No! No!

572
01:19:11,533 --> 01:19:12,576
No!

573
01:19:27,049 --> 01:19:31,637
Angel! Angel! Angel!

574
01:19:31,720 --> 01:19:33,097
Angel! Angel!

575
01:19:33,139 --> 01:19:36,142
Angel, this is for you.
You have 2 minutes.

576
01:19:38,394 --> 01:19:40,146
I'll be right there.

577
01:19:57,914 --> 01:20:03,003
Angel! Angel! Angel!

578
01:20:08,676 --> 01:20:09,760
Okay.

579
01:20:49,218 --> 01:20:51,345
I'm glad it's going to be you.

580
01:20:52,513 --> 01:20:53,806
Sorry, son.

581
01:21:12,367 --> 01:21:14,077
Chance Templeton is dead.

582
01:21:14,119 --> 01:21:16,163
What are you talking about?

583
01:21:17,581 --> 01:21:19,124
When I found you,

584
01:21:20,584 --> 01:21:24,421
I thought you'd been given a second chance.
Now I've got mine.

585
01:21:25,923 --> 01:21:28,342
I have always handled our business.

586
01:21:31,720 --> 01:21:33,597
I'll take care of this.

587
01:21:35,891 --> 01:21:37,768
Now get your ass out of here.

588
01:21:38,352 --> 01:21:41,356

589
01:21:41,856 --> 01:21:43,566
I'm right behind you.

590
01:21:46,444 --> 01:21:48,822
I've always been right behind you.

591
01:21:57,330 --> 01:21:59,458
We have you surrounded.
