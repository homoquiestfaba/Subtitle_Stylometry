1
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:17,744
No watch, no wallet, no shoes.
This guy was picked clean.

2
00:01:18,912 --> 00:01:21,415
In this neighborhood, he's lucky
to have the fillings in his teeth.

3
00:01:24,918 --> 00:01:25,961
Still there.

4
00:01:30,215 --> 00:01:31,675
This guy was well-groomed.

5
00:01:32,301 --> 00:01:34,469
I don't care if he was
lemon-scented and martinized,

6
00:01:34,511 --> 00:01:36,930
if he was on Washington
and D, he was copping.

7
00:01:37,973 --> 00:01:39,766
He should have just said no.

8
00:01:44,396 --> 00:01:46,732
Maybe somebody wouldn't
take no for an answer.

9
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:50,611
CSI 4x16 Getting off by Kornifex

10
00:02:21,558 --> 00:02:24,603
So, Detective Cavaliere how
long have you been in Vegas?

11
00:02:24,645 --> 00:02:25,521
Couple of weeks.

12
00:02:26,021 --> 00:02:29,024
Welcome to Tranny-town. This
is where the hustlers come.

13
00:02:29,441 --> 00:02:31,360
Yeah, I can see why. It's very romantic.

14
00:02:38,909 --> 00:02:39,743
This is new.

15
00:02:42,788 --> 00:02:46,333
Don't get territorial. It's
for my own personal collection.

16
00:02:46,792 --> 00:02:50,087
Whatever blows your
skirt up. Burn me a copy.

17
00:02:50,963 --> 00:02:52,673
There's a small cut on the forehead.

18
00:02:53,757 --> 00:02:56,969
Yeah, it looks like he's wearing
makeup. Blush on the cheeks...

19
00:02:57,344 --> 00:02:58,428
lipstick.

20
00:02:58,887 --> 00:03:01,765
Transvestite. Fits the profile.

21
00:03:05,102 --> 00:03:09,439
Honeymoon suite's across the way.
Anonyms sex becomes anonymous sex crime.

22
00:03:10,399 --> 00:03:12,067
Murder usually personal.

23
00:03:12,568 --> 00:03:15,195
Maybe whoever had the last
dance left behind a corsage.

24
00:03:15,529 --> 00:03:17,698
I'd settle for his clothes.

25
00:03:17,906 --> 00:03:19,324
Hey, I'll give you a hand.

26
00:03:29,126 --> 00:03:30,919
You think a hacksaw's
going to do the trick?

27
00:03:31,253 --> 00:03:36,758
No. But that's why
god invented sawzalls.

28
00:04:32,814 --> 00:04:34,816
All we got is a decapitated doll.

29
00:04:35,359 --> 00:04:37,027
That's still legal in Nevada.

30
00:04:40,113 --> 00:04:42,115
Dave, what's up? You find something?

31
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:46,745
I was just thinking I wouldn't
be caught dead in those shorts.

32
00:04:51,208 --> 00:04:55,671
Yo, baby, look, why're you rushing
the day? We got plenty of night left.

33
00:04:55,712 --> 00:04:56,713
I'm working, lady.

34
00:04:56,755 --> 00:04:59,883
See, that's something we already got
in common, 'cause I'm working, too.

35
00:05:00,425 --> 00:05:01,051
Oh, yeah?

36
00:05:01,176 --> 00:05:01,927
mm-Hmm.

37
00:05:04,513 --> 00:05:05,472
Were you working him?

38
00:05:08,976 --> 00:05:13,981
Him? No. No, sir. But I tell you
one thing. Good-looking white boy

39
00:05:14,022 --> 00:05:17,693
like that? I know plenty of women
who'd be tripping over their platform to

40
00:05:17,734 --> 00:05:21,572
get a little somethin' somethin'. But
no, sir, he wasn't nobody's customer.

41
00:05:23,031 --> 00:05:23,782
Really?

42
00:05:33,208 --> 00:05:36,253
This guy get here on
foot? I don't see a car.

43
00:05:37,296 --> 00:05:38,338
They haven't found one yet.

44
00:05:38,797 --> 00:05:40,549
I suppose nobody saw it drive away.

45
00:05:40,591 --> 00:05:42,301
They were all in the bathroom.

46
00:05:50,309 --> 00:05:53,937
Multiple stab wounds. The deepest
of which transected the thoracic

47
00:05:53,979 --> 00:05:56,773
aorta and the right mainstream bronchus.

48
00:05:57,983 --> 00:05:58,775
Anything else?

49
00:05:59,359 --> 00:06:03,280
His name is Ed Burnell. Matched
his prints, prior for possession.

50
00:06:03,989 --> 00:06:08,076
And it's not the first time he stared
death in the face. Our man had a double

51
00:06:08,118 --> 00:06:13,499
dose of cirrhosis. That takes work.
Years of hard-core alcohol abuse, plus

52
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:17,294
hepatitis, probably
acquired by dirty needles.

53
00:06:17,711 --> 00:06:21,340
In Chinese medicine, the
liver is the organ of anger.

54
00:06:21,381 --> 00:06:24,927
Addicts and alcoholics medicate their
anger, consequently, destroy their liver.

55
00:06:25,177 --> 00:06:29,306
Actually, half the
liver is pretty healthy.

56
00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:31,016
The new half.

57
00:06:33,644 --> 00:06:37,606
Oh... a graft from a less angry donor.

58
00:06:38,649 --> 00:06:42,402
Organ recipient procedure is pretty
clear. They only do transplants

59
00:06:42,444 --> 00:06:44,196
on people who test clean for a year.

60
00:06:44,404 --> 00:06:48,158
Well, he probably got his new liver,
figured he could, uh, start all over again.

61
00:06:48,367 --> 00:06:51,370
Is that what you think? That
once an addict, always an addict?

62
00:06:54,581 --> 00:06:57,459
Don't let the scope touch
the garment. You don't want to

63
00:06:57,501 --> 00:07:00,629
contaminate the evidence.
And work systematically.

64
00:07:02,256 --> 00:07:03,841
Up-down,
left-right, what?

65
00:07:04,132 --> 00:07:07,970
Oh, whatever works for you.
Just don't miss any spots.

66
00:07:08,428 --> 00:07:12,182
All right, hang on. What
do those look like to you?

67
00:07:12,724 --> 00:07:13,934
Semen stains.

68
00:07:13,976 --> 00:07:14,726
Yes.

69
00:07:15,227 --> 00:07:17,688
Which, on a man's underwear,
aren't exactly probative.

70
00:07:17,729 --> 00:07:18,146
No.

71
00:07:18,814 --> 00:07:21,608
Can't tell you how long they've been
there, or how often the guy changes

72
00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:26,405
his shorts. You know, I knew guys that
could go up to four days on one single

73
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:27,322
pair of tighty-whities.

74
00:07:27,364 --> 00:07:29,616
Thanks for putting that
picture in my brain.

75
00:07:30,534 --> 00:07:31,326
All right, so...

76
00:07:32,411 --> 00:07:36,623
I want you to outline each
individual stain with dots. But keep

77
00:07:36,665 --> 00:07:40,460
them at least an eighth of an inch
from the edge to avoid contamination.

78
00:07:40,502 --> 00:07:43,547
And then, cut out the swatches
and send them to myself in DNA.

79
00:07:44,298 --> 00:07:45,215
You got it.

80
00:07:49,303 --> 00:07:51,471
A fiber in his nose.

81
00:07:51,722 --> 00:07:53,473
Yeah, I'll get it to trace.

82
00:08:00,355 --> 00:08:01,690
Petechial hemorrhaging.

83
00:08:03,692 --> 00:08:06,445
I would've thought he was strangled
during some kind of rough sex-

84
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:08,989
play, but there's no marks.

85
00:08:09,031 --> 00:08:10,949
Suffocation maybe?

86
00:08:10,991 --> 00:08:13,243
That's why undertakers
love smother-victims.

87
00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:16,955
He's got something under his nails.

88
00:08:25,839 --> 00:08:27,132
Looks like silver paint.

89
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:33,555
Vegas brow. A showgirl

90
00:08:33,597 --> 00:08:38,644
thing. Eyebrows thin out from all the
plucking and waxing and filling in.

91
00:08:38,685 --> 00:08:42,189
Well, we can kind of rule
him out as a showgirl.

92
00:08:42,231 --> 00:08:42,606
Yeah.

93
00:08:42,773 --> 00:08:46,860
And, you know, he's hairy
for a drag queen. Hey, David?

94
00:08:47,444 --> 00:08:48,070
Yeah?

95
00:08:48,237 --> 00:08:49,655
Could you hit the lights?

96
00:09:02,042 --> 00:09:04,419
Wow that's noit beauty
make-up his face looks painted.

97
00:09:05,379 --> 00:09:07,214
Kinda looks like a clown.

98
00:09:12,761 --> 00:09:16,265
Yo, man, get these spiders off
my face, man! I gotta beam up

99
00:09:16,306 --> 00:09:19,309
outta here. I need my medication.

100
00:09:19,309 --> 00:09:21,812
I'm a CEO of a five-bag-a-day
corporation, you know that?

101
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:25,691
- Uh, come on. Let's go.
- Thank you.

102
00:09:31,238 --> 00:09:35,576
Y'all look like cartoons,
man. Okay, thank you.

103
00:09:36,285 --> 00:09:39,872
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Take it easy,
pal. You're not running the four-

104
00:09:39,913 --> 00:09:41,165
minute mile on those pins.

105
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:42,374
Nice shoes.

106
00:09:42,416 --> 00:09:43,500
It's all good, it's all good.

107
00:09:46,128 --> 00:09:49,381
Whoa! Who gonna pay for
that hole in my ride, man?

108
00:09:49,756 --> 00:09:52,259
Your ride? This was never your
ride. This car belongs to Ed Burnell.

109
00:09:52,301 --> 00:09:55,304
Finders keepers, baby.
I gotta bag me some ho's.

110
00:09:55,637 --> 00:09:57,139
What drug is he on?

111
00:09:57,598 --> 00:10:00,559
I don't know. Whatever it is, he
either took too much or not enough.

112
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:06,440
Just 'cause the guy looks like a
clown doesn't mean he is a clown.

113
00:10:06,732 --> 00:10:09,318
Description didn't match anyone
in missing persons. If you've got a

114
00:10:09,359 --> 00:10:10,694
better idea, now's the time.

115
00:10:18,911 --> 00:10:20,454
I'd say we're in the right place.

116
00:10:20,495 --> 00:10:23,040
Yeah. Either that or they're
casting a John Wayne Gacey revue.

117
00:10:24,166 --> 00:10:26,752
And you can tell that putz
that Buddy Ween doesn't send

118
00:10:26,793 --> 00:10:29,296
cruise ship talent for bar
mitzvah wages. You got that?

119
00:10:30,464 --> 00:10:33,425
Uh, strippers are down the
hall, girls. This is clowns.

120
00:10:33,467 --> 00:10:34,009
No kidding.

121
00:10:34,635 --> 00:10:38,138
I'm Catherine Willows. This is Sara
Sidle. We're with the crime lab.

122
00:10:38,514 --> 00:10:40,682
Well, why didn't you say so?
We do lots of police parties.

123
00:10:41,183 --> 00:10:43,477
The party has already happened.

124
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:47,940
What am I supposed to do with this?

125
00:10:48,398 --> 00:10:51,068
Identify the body. Did
that man ever work for you?

126
00:10:51,485 --> 00:10:54,279
Well, let me put it
this way: I rep clowns.

127
00:10:55,030 --> 00:10:57,699
That's Flappy, that's
Flappy Junior, that's Allen

128
00:10:57,741 --> 00:11:01,036
...he doesn't work that much... Popo...

129
00:11:01,078 --> 00:11:03,872
get it? All I do is book the face.

130
00:11:03,914 --> 00:11:04,998
I don't care what's underneath.

131
00:11:05,415 --> 00:11:09,127
If our victim was a professional
clown, would he be in this book?

132
00:11:09,169 --> 00:11:09,837
Uh-huh.

133
00:11:10,838 --> 00:11:12,339
What are these numbers for?

134
00:11:12,381 --> 00:11:15,300
That's the national clown
and character registry.

135
00:11:16,176 --> 00:11:17,678
How do you register a clown?

136
00:11:17,845 --> 00:11:22,349
Well, not the clown. The look,
the face. Each one is unique.

137
00:11:22,391 --> 00:11:23,725
It's like snowflakes.

138
00:11:23,976 --> 00:11:25,519
We're going to need
to take this with us.

139
00:11:25,853 --> 00:11:31,316
You got a warrant? I'm kidding.
Okay, it's just a loaner, though.

140
00:11:33,610 --> 00:11:37,906
I know you stealin' my medication.
I am in pain, damn it! Bring me

141
00:11:37,948 --> 00:11:38,782
some stuff!

142
00:11:42,911 --> 00:11:44,580
What are you two ladies lookin' at?

143
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:47,916
Uh... Jamal...

144
00:11:48,458 --> 00:11:52,129
we're with the Las Vegas crime lab. It

145
00:11:52,171 --> 00:11:56,758
seems you were driving a dead man's
car when you got in your accident.

146
00:11:57,217 --> 00:12:02,139
Half the peoples I know be dead. It
don't mean they can't own a vehicle.

147
00:12:02,472 --> 00:12:06,393
Hey, Vanilla Ice... at this point
you're lookin' at a murder rap,

148
00:12:06,435 --> 00:12:11,732
which may end you up on death row, and
I'm not talking about the record label.

149
00:12:11,773 --> 00:12:14,109
Nurse, this be cruel and unusual!

150
00:12:14,151 --> 00:12:18,655
Look, pal, right now the evidence
tells us that you killed the man

151
00:12:18,697 --> 00:12:21,283
whose car you were driving.
You want to explain that?

152
00:12:21,867 --> 00:12:23,327
Explain what, B?

153
00:12:24,077 --> 00:12:28,290
I was laid up shootin'
speedballs all day. Look, man,

154
00:12:28,957 --> 00:12:32,252
when I get off, I'm gone. Feel me? I

155
00:12:32,294 --> 00:12:35,547
can't see nothin', I can't hear nothin'.

156
00:12:36,131 --> 00:12:38,675
Wherever high is, that's
where I take the elevator up.

157
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:43,013
Oh, you damn cow! Took you long enough.

158
00:12:43,514 --> 00:12:45,849
When I call you, you
come, you understand me?

159
00:12:45,891 --> 00:12:48,268
Why you got to do me like this?

160
00:12:48,852 --> 00:12:53,023
That's right. Man's dead.

161
00:12:53,524 --> 00:12:58,445
What difference it make how he got
there? Now, if you'll excuse me,

162
00:12:58,487 --> 00:13:03,617
I got a date with Mrs. Jones.

163
00:13:04,159 --> 00:13:08,914
Man's already dead. Why he
be needing shoes, anyway?

164
00:13:09,665 --> 00:13:11,416
Was that a confession?

165
00:13:11,458 --> 00:13:13,001
I think a plea of insanity.

166
00:13:36,149 --> 00:13:39,486
DNA results on the blood from
Jamal's clothes. It's his own.

167
00:13:40,237 --> 00:13:42,781
Well, the blood spatter's consistent
with a front end collision.

168
00:13:43,448 --> 00:13:45,158
So he didn't kill him in the car.

169
00:13:45,325 --> 00:13:48,328
Doesn't mean he didn't kill him.
What I want to know is how's a

170
00:13:48,370 --> 00:13:52,124
strung-out junkie like Jamal get a
guy out of the car with just his knife?

171
00:13:52,499 --> 00:13:54,626
Yeah, and why stab him six times?

172
00:13:55,002 --> 00:13:57,629
Well, let's just say for argument's
sake that Jamal is telling the

173
00:13:57,671 --> 00:14:02,342
truth and that Burnell was already dead when
he took his wallet, his shoes and his car.

174
00:14:02,759 --> 00:14:05,429
Well, if the motive wasn't
robbery... what was it?

175
00:14:13,896 --> 00:14:15,272
Maybe this'll tell us.

176
00:14:39,630 --> 00:14:40,297
Heroin?

177
00:14:40,339 --> 00:14:42,466
Negative on
marquis-mecke-froede.

178
00:14:42,925 --> 00:14:44,426
So, if it's not an opiate, what is it?

179
00:14:44,927 --> 00:14:48,263
I don't know. I've never seen it
before. I ran a color and crystal

180
00:14:48,347 --> 00:14:49,223
test. Take a look.

181
00:14:52,851 --> 00:14:55,354
All I can tell you is
it's an indole alkaloid.

182
00:14:55,812 --> 00:14:57,439
Did you run it through the GCMS?

183
00:14:57,481 --> 00:15:00,234
Yeah, but it's not in the library.

184
00:16:08,886 --> 00:16:11,763
That's Doodles. A.K.A. Donny Zanko.

185
00:16:12,181 --> 00:16:12,890
So you know him.

186
00:16:14,266 --> 00:16:18,145
There are two kinds of clowns:
There's your ex-circus pros,

187
00:16:18,187 --> 00:16:20,564
washed out of Ringling
Brothers, Barnum and Bailey,

188
00:16:20,564 --> 00:16:22,482
and then there's your
basic chuckleheads.

189
00:16:23,108 --> 00:16:24,359
Which kind was Doodles?

190
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:29,239
Basic chucklehead. You know, buy
a getup, learn some tricks, and

191
00:16:29,281 --> 00:16:34,411
grab some scratch boring the crap out
of nine-year-olds. He was a good birthday

192
00:16:34,453 --> 00:16:36,371
man, except when he, uh...

193
00:16:36,788 --> 00:16:39,333
So, he made money boring kids?

194
00:16:39,374 --> 00:16:43,462
Parents throw parties. They like
clowns because they think their

195
00:16:43,504 --> 00:16:44,463
kids like clowns.

196
00:16:44,505 --> 00:16:48,383
Mm-hmm. Lindsey's fourth... bad scene.

197
00:16:48,425 --> 00:16:49,176
Oh.

198
00:16:50,052 --> 00:16:53,514
So, what was the last
gig you booked for him?

199
00:16:53,555 --> 00:16:56,975
Uh... car wash, couple
of weeks back. Why?

200
00:16:57,017 --> 00:17:00,854
Mr. Ween, he's been dead less than
48 hours and he was wearing his makeup

201
00:17:00,896 --> 00:17:01,730
when he was killed.

202
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:06,276
That son of a bitch. He was
working off the books. I never

203
00:17:06,318 --> 00:17:07,861
thought Doodles would try to stiff me.

204
00:17:07,903 --> 00:17:10,364
He, actually, was the
one who got stiffed.

205
00:17:17,287 --> 00:17:20,999
So, it turns out Burnell's tox
report was clean. Not only that, he

206
00:17:21,041 --> 00:17:22,960
works at some sort of recovery center.

207
00:17:23,836 --> 00:17:24,837
Well, that makes sense.

208
00:17:25,337 --> 00:17:26,004
It does?

209
00:17:26,129 --> 00:17:29,633
Well, the substance we found
in his car was ibogaine.

210
00:17:29,967 --> 00:17:31,468
What's that, the stuff that grows hair?

211
00:17:33,136 --> 00:17:38,225
A choline-esterase inhibitor that
acts as a stimulant in the central

212
00:17:38,267 --> 00:17:39,017
nervous system.

213
00:17:39,601 --> 00:17:43,730
In the liver, it converts to an
active metabolite... noribogaine.

214
00:17:43,772 --> 00:17:46,859
Noribogaine locks onto
addiction receptors...

215
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:49,069
blocking the feedback loops that

216
00:17:49,111 --> 00:17:50,279
reinforce dependency.

217
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:52,406
In human speak?

218
00:17:52,781 --> 00:17:55,951
Well, apparently, in some cases,
one dose of ibogaine can cure

219
00:17:55,993 --> 00:17:56,910
physical addiction.

220
00:17:56,952 --> 00:17:58,829
Does it come with a
free set of steak knives?

221
00:17:58,871 --> 00:18:02,624
It comes with a free trip. Curing
physical addiction is a side

222
00:18:02,666 --> 00:18:07,796
effect. Its intended use is to
facilitate visual, tactile, and auditory

223
00:18:07,838 --> 00:18:09,923
experiences of alternate realities.

224
00:18:10,632 --> 00:18:12,217
So it's an hallucinogen.

225
00:18:12,259 --> 00:18:18,056
Mm-hmm. Used by the Bwiti tribe of
Central Africa. It comes from the

226
00:18:18,098 --> 00:18:20,309
powdered bark of a tree
growing in Cameroon.

227
00:18:22,352 --> 00:18:23,228
No kidding.

228
00:18:23,729 --> 00:18:27,232
Many ethno-botanists believe that
the iboga is what the bible is

229
00:18:27,274 --> 00:18:29,610
talking about when it refers
to the tree of knowledge.

230
00:18:30,194 --> 00:18:34,072
The Bwiti consume the powdered bark
as part of an initiation ceremony.

231
00:18:34,114 --> 00:18:39,495
After the ritual, a man is called
baanzi, one who has seen the other world.

232
00:18:40,162 --> 00:18:40,954
No way it's legal.

233
00:18:40,996 --> 00:18:42,122
Not in the U.S.

234
00:18:42,164 --> 00:18:44,208
So, Ed Burnell was a drug dealer.

235
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:45,292
Well...

236
00:18:45,334 --> 00:18:48,128
He's either dealing in the addiction
or the cure, and a dealer's a

237
00:18:48,170 --> 00:18:51,798
dealer. And this guy's
dealing out of a halfway house.

238
00:19:18,283 --> 00:19:20,953
Well... I can see why Doodles drank.

239
00:19:21,245 --> 00:19:25,874
So, if he's hooking up in
Tranny-town, you'd expect to find some

240
00:19:25,916 --> 00:19:27,251
man-on-man
porn.

241
00:19:27,751 --> 00:19:29,753
All we've got is
varying flavors of juggs.

242
00:19:30,504 --> 00:19:31,046
Hmm.

243
00:19:42,558 --> 00:19:44,935
Looks like Doodles was
working out some animosity.

244
00:19:46,812 --> 00:19:49,022
Oh, an answering machine with messages.

245
00:19:50,107 --> 00:19:52,776
Friday, 11:02. AM

246
00:19:53,402 --> 00:19:57,823
Hey, Doodle-pie. I can't stop
thinking about your enormous feet.

247
00:19:57,865 --> 00:19:59,825
You know what they say about big feet.

248
00:19:59,867 --> 00:20:00,909
... 02 P.M.

249
00:20:00,951 --> 00:20:05,247
Okay, paddle boy, you want a war, you
got one. And just so you know, I do

250
00:20:05,289 --> 00:20:08,417
appreciate the irony of
me leaving you a message.

251
00:20:10,127 --> 00:20:11,003
Interesting.

252
00:20:11,712 --> 00:20:14,047
Hey, Mr. Doodles, your taxi's here.

253
00:20:14,089 --> 00:20:16,758
Yeah, yeah, cool your
jets. I'll be right down.

254
00:20:17,134 --> 00:20:22,764
He took a cab ride two days
ago... and his costume's not here.

255
00:20:22,806 --> 00:20:26,852
Makes sense if he's out of town
on a job. I'll call Detective

256
00:20:26,894 --> 00:20:28,729
Cavaliere and have him
pull the phone records.

257
00:20:31,148 --> 00:20:34,651
Burnell worked here for about
a year. This is a halfway house.

258
00:20:34,693 --> 00:20:38,530
We provide a safe place to live. I mean,
if they're going to do ibogaine, I'd

259
00:20:38,572 --> 00:20:40,407
rather have them do it in
here than out in the street.

260
00:20:41,575 --> 00:20:44,661
And despite the fact that San Quentin
is your alma mater and you have a

261
00:20:44,703 --> 00:20:47,289
record as long as my leg, you
wouldn't do anything illegal, right?

262
00:20:47,748 --> 00:20:50,375
I wouldn't do anything to
jeopardize this place, and we don't

263
00:20:50,417 --> 00:20:54,129
give out illegal drugs. We
do a lot of good work here.

264
00:20:55,255 --> 00:20:59,551
You know, if ibogaine is such a miracle
cure, wouldn't it make your life easier?

265
00:20:59,593 --> 00:21:03,597
The drug doesn't promise
anything. You got to earn it. If a

266
00:21:03,639 --> 00:21:08,519
user doesn't realize why he used in
the first place, I mean, no power in the

267
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:13,899
world is going to make him stop.
Right here is a good case in point.

268
00:21:19,112 --> 00:21:20,572
So, you're going?

269
00:21:21,281 --> 00:21:22,115
Yeah.

270
00:21:24,243 --> 00:21:25,536
You sure that's what you want to do?

271
00:21:26,954 --> 00:21:31,083
Yeah. This place just
reminds me too much of Ed.

272
00:21:34,795 --> 00:21:37,089
Look, I really wish you'd
stay here a little longer.

273
00:21:38,298 --> 00:21:39,424
I can't.

274
00:21:41,844 --> 00:21:43,262
You did a good job here, Mindy.

275
00:21:45,097 --> 00:21:46,265
I'm still doing it.

276
00:21:50,644 --> 00:21:51,603
What's her story?

277
00:21:51,895 --> 00:21:56,066
Ed got her clean. Let me show you
what she looked like two months ago.

278
00:21:58,443 --> 00:21:59,945
What are you doing here, Mindy?

279
00:22:00,737 --> 00:22:01,738
Wanna get off.

280
00:22:04,324 --> 00:22:09,371
I... I don't got another
run in me, but I can't stop.

281
00:22:10,956 --> 00:22:14,418
My name is Ed Burnell. I'm
here to help you, Mindy.

282
00:22:21,216 --> 00:22:25,637
This place is nice. Can I stay here, Ed?

283
00:22:25,971 --> 00:22:26,930
Yes.

284
00:22:28,098 --> 00:22:30,517
'Cause you're gonna
take care of me, right?

285
00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:32,436
Yes, I'm going to take care of you.

286
00:22:38,901 --> 00:22:42,446
So, was it the ibogaine or
the months she spent here?

287
00:22:42,863 --> 00:22:44,364
You don't believe in ibogaine?

288
00:22:44,406 --> 00:22:46,241
I don't believe in miracles.

289
00:22:46,742 --> 00:22:47,534
But Ed did?

290
00:22:47,576 --> 00:22:52,122
Look, when Ed first came here,
he was an asset to the place. And

291
00:22:52,164 --> 00:22:57,419
then he got... religious about it.
You know, there's a reason why Mohammed

292
00:22:57,461 --> 00:22:59,213
kept his ass on the mountain.

293
00:22:59,713 --> 00:23:03,926
It was safe there. The
thing about recovery is

294
00:23:03,967 --> 00:23:06,345
it only works for those who want
it, not for those who need it.

295
00:23:06,929 --> 00:23:09,973
But Ed came down from the mountain,
and he brought the ibogaine with him.

296
00:23:10,349 --> 00:23:13,602
Yeah, and he started pushing it
on everyone. Sometimes he won,

297
00:23:13,644 --> 00:23:14,686
sometimes he lost.

298
00:23:15,729 --> 00:23:17,314
From one addiction to another.

299
00:23:21,193 --> 00:23:24,488
I can't believe Doodles is
dead. When did it happen?

300
00:23:24,738 --> 00:23:26,573
We're hoping you can help us find out.

301
00:23:27,157 --> 00:23:30,327
Yeah, according to Sunburst Taxi
one of the drivers dropped off

302
00:23:30,369 --> 00:23:32,079
the clown here two days ago.

303
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:34,790
Yeah, that's right. My
son was having a birthday.

304
00:23:35,791 --> 00:23:38,418
It's my own little tradition.
Birthdays, special occasions, I

305
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:40,295
always hire a clown. The kids love them.

306
00:23:40,337 --> 00:23:44,341
Except this time, I think maybe
we should've gone to Circus Circus.

307
00:23:46,134 --> 00:23:47,427
What do you mean by that?

308
00:23:47,469 --> 00:23:51,974
Well, we hired a clown
- squirting flower, big floppy shoes and

309
00:23:52,015 --> 00:23:54,643
all that
- what we got was a smackdown.

310
00:23:56,478 --> 00:24:01,650
Doodles was going through
his clown bit, and, uh, then

311
00:24:01,692 --> 00:24:06,071
this mime comes through our kitchen, which
at first we thought it was part of the act.

312
00:24:09,783 --> 00:24:11,410
What the hell are you doing here?

313
00:24:24,214 --> 00:24:28,844
So, uh, I jumped in and broke it
up and dragged the Mime into the

314
00:24:28,886 --> 00:24:31,597
kitchen. I was going to call you guys...

315
00:24:31,638 --> 00:24:32,389
Mmm.

316
00:24:32,723 --> 00:24:36,727
...But he apologized and said
that, uh, there was bad blood

317
00:24:36,768 --> 00:24:41,440
between him and Doodles. And he gave me
a hundred bucks for the damages, which

318
00:24:41,481 --> 00:24:45,027
I thought was a pretty stand
up thing to do, so I let him go.

319
00:24:45,277 --> 00:24:46,570
Did you get his name?

320
00:24:47,946 --> 00:24:49,239
I did better than that.

321
00:24:50,282 --> 00:24:54,953
He, uh, told me he'd give me great rate
if I ever wanted to upgrade from clowns.

322
00:24:57,372 --> 00:25:00,209
And what time did Doodles leave?

323
00:25:00,792 --> 00:25:04,713
The kids were really upset after
the fight, so I took them out for

324
00:25:04,755 --> 00:25:05,547
ice cream.

325
00:25:05,589 --> 00:25:09,259
Doodles stuck around to help me
clean up, and then he asked me

326
00:25:09,301 --> 00:25:10,177
to call him a cab.

327
00:25:10,594 --> 00:25:13,889
Do you remember the name of the
taxi company or the time of the call?

328
00:25:13,931 --> 00:25:17,059
Well, he'd been such a good
sport that I offered to give him a

329
00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:20,521
ride home. I dropped him off
at his place at around 8:30.

330
00:25:45,921 --> 00:25:46,713
Hey, excuse me.

331
00:25:50,884 --> 00:25:51,718
Take a look.

332
00:26:01,728 --> 00:26:04,398
Look, you do have the right to
remain silent, but unless you

333
00:26:04,439 --> 00:26:06,275
want a trip to the station,
I really wouldn't keep it up.

334
00:26:06,775 --> 00:26:08,986
You want to talk about Doodles, fine.

335
00:26:09,570 --> 00:26:11,321
Take a look at what
that skeek did to me.

336
00:26:13,198 --> 00:26:14,449
You got that at Maguires'?

337
00:26:16,827 --> 00:26:20,122
Stick a mime and a clown in the
same place, it's like a cobra

338
00:26:20,164 --> 00:26:20,914
and a mongoose.

339
00:26:20,956 --> 00:26:24,877
You crashed Doodles' party, he kicked
your ass, and now Doodles is dead.

340
00:26:25,544 --> 00:26:26,420
I didn't kill him.

341
00:26:26,461 --> 00:26:29,923
You left a threatening message on his
answering machine. You declared war.

342
00:26:29,965 --> 00:26:33,051
Look, the creep was a parasite.
When he wasn't bad-mouthing me,

343
00:26:33,093 --> 00:26:37,347
he was horning in on my gigs. Every time
I line up a job, "ring-ring," Doodles

344
00:26:37,389 --> 00:26:41,602
calls the mom, gets her to hire him,
too. That's money out of my pocket. So,

345
00:26:41,643 --> 00:26:43,687
yeah, I figured a little
payback was in order.

346
00:26:43,896 --> 00:26:45,731
Yeah, what did you do
after you left the Maguires?

347
00:26:45,772 --> 00:26:47,941
I had a strip mall opening out of town.

348
00:26:48,358 --> 00:26:50,819
You didn't stop by his house? You
know, wait for him to come back?

349
00:26:50,861 --> 00:26:54,239
No. I got two hookers in
Pahrump who can verify.

350
00:26:59,077 --> 00:27:02,080
We found prints belonging to three
separate people in Ed Burnell's

351
00:27:02,122 --> 00:27:05,459
car: His, Jamal the thief, and Mindy.

352
00:27:05,792 --> 00:27:06,877
He could have given her a lift.

353
00:27:06,919 --> 00:27:08,921
Except we found her print on a condom.

354
00:27:08,962 --> 00:27:10,297
Well, she said she loved Ed.

355
00:27:10,339 --> 00:27:12,633
Yeah? How much, I wonder.

356
00:27:20,182 --> 00:27:24,436
We're looking for information on Mindy
Dupont. This was her last known address.

357
00:27:25,896 --> 00:27:26,855
Yeah, she's here.

358
00:27:28,273 --> 00:27:29,608
Mind if we talk with her?

359
00:27:30,108 --> 00:27:31,276
You got a search warrant?

360
00:27:31,902 --> 00:27:36,824
You don't need a warrant just to talk. But
if you want, we'll go get one and come back.

361
00:27:36,865 --> 00:27:39,660
Hey, it's a free country.

362
00:27:39,701 --> 00:27:40,828
Yes, it is.

363
00:27:50,420 --> 00:27:55,175
Mindy Dupont. We heard
you cleaned yourself up.

364
00:27:56,927 --> 00:27:58,846
I tried so hard.

365
00:28:03,475 --> 00:28:05,352
He said I would feel again.

366
00:28:08,230 --> 00:28:09,898
I never wanted to feel.

367
00:28:14,528 --> 00:28:16,488
Ed saved my life.

368
00:28:17,948 --> 00:28:19,908
How do you repay a favor like that?

369
00:28:20,951 --> 00:28:22,244
I tried.

370
00:28:24,705 --> 00:28:25,706
We're going to clean you up.

371
00:28:26,623 --> 00:28:28,333
What if I don't want to be clean?

372
00:28:28,375 --> 00:28:32,004
No. I'm going to help you.

373
00:28:33,714 --> 00:28:35,382
He was an angel.

374
00:28:38,594 --> 00:28:41,471
He gave me that stuff.

375
00:28:41,889 --> 00:28:43,682
And you didn't want to get high anymore.

376
00:28:54,902 --> 00:28:58,363
Did you come here to
remember or to forget?

377
00:29:01,950 --> 00:29:06,330
Well, the mime's alibi checks out. He
took polaroids, with the hookers. Strip

378
00:29:06,371 --> 00:29:09,291
mall opened at 7:30. He didn't
leave Pahrump till the next morning.

379
00:29:09,333 --> 00:29:12,252
Uh-huh. So that leaves us with what?

380
00:29:13,045 --> 00:29:14,004
Nothing.

381
00:29:14,296 --> 00:29:14,755
Hmm.

382
00:29:17,674 --> 00:29:21,720
What about timeline? Mrs. Maguire gives

383
00:29:21,762 --> 00:29:26,475
Doodles a lift, getting
him home around 8:30.

384
00:29:26,517 --> 00:29:29,269
As far as we know, he didn't
have another job that night.

385
00:29:29,728 --> 00:29:34,733
Doodles goes home, having performing
all day for kids, wrestling with

386
00:29:34,775 --> 00:29:39,613
mimes. His costume would've been a little
skanky, yet he doesn't change out of it?

387
00:29:39,655 --> 00:29:41,114
Maybe he never got inside.

388
00:29:42,324 --> 00:29:45,410
And he walks around town in his
clown suit until he gets killed?

389
00:29:45,953 --> 00:29:49,122
Okay, what are the
knowns? Um... Doodles was

390
00:29:49,164 --> 00:29:52,251
suffocated. We found
yellow fibers up his nose.

391
00:29:52,417 --> 00:29:55,671
Greg analyzed the semen
stains on his boxer shorts

392
00:29:55,712 --> 00:29:58,924
and found an unknown vaginal
contribution in the sample.

393
00:30:00,008 --> 00:30:03,345
Mrs. Maguire was the last
person to see him alive.

394
00:30:07,266 --> 00:30:10,018
The night Ed Burnell was killed you
never checked into the halfway house.

395
00:30:12,437 --> 00:30:18,068
Mindy, we found a knife in your basket
of clothes with Ed Burnell's blood on it.

396
00:30:18,819 --> 00:30:20,362
Help us connect the dots.

397
00:30:23,198 --> 00:30:28,328
We all have this secret,
terrible cave in our hearts,

398
00:30:29,746 --> 00:30:32,166
and the more we try to escape it,

399
00:30:32,958 --> 00:30:35,961
the deeper we drive
ourselves inside of it.

400
00:30:36,003 --> 00:30:38,922
This isn't the halfway
house, Mindy. You're looking

401
00:30:38,964 --> 00:30:42,176
at a murder rap, so
let's talk specifics.

402
00:30:42,676 --> 00:30:44,761
There were fifty-seven
micrograms per milliliter

403
00:30:44,803 --> 00:30:47,306
of monoacetylmorphine in your urine

404
00:30:47,347 --> 00:30:51,226
sample. That means you
were using for a while.

405
00:30:52,811 --> 00:30:54,730
Ed gave me ibogaine.

406
00:30:54,771 --> 00:30:57,816
That was months ago. Where were
you the night Ed was killed?

407
00:30:57,858 --> 00:31:04,406
It was like Adam and Eve
taking you to the movies except

408
00:31:04,823 --> 00:31:10,662
the movie was your life and you were
watching it and in it at the same time.

409
00:31:10,704 --> 00:31:13,457
Why would you have a
knife with his blood on it?

410
00:31:17,294 --> 00:31:19,171
I think Ed Burnell knew you were

411
00:31:19,213 --> 00:31:21,256
using again and he was out
there that night looking for you.

412
00:31:22,132 --> 00:31:27,095
The spirits... they protect you.

413
00:31:28,222 --> 00:31:32,100
Well, you better hope so, because you're
under arrest for the murder of Ed Burnell.

414
00:31:37,272 --> 00:31:40,234
Sara. Excuse me. Could
you, uh, help me out?

415
00:31:40,359 --> 00:31:41,485
Yeah, with what?

416
00:31:41,527 --> 00:31:46,240
A woman. I need you to process
a female suspect for me.

417
00:31:46,657 --> 00:31:47,199
Sure.

418
00:31:48,700 --> 00:31:49,701
Palms down.

419
00:32:36,748 --> 00:32:38,458
Thanks. You can get dressed now.

420
00:32:39,877 --> 00:32:43,213
Samples from your suspect. There's

421
00:32:43,255 --> 00:32:46,633
nothing but a few track marks.
No defensive wounds, no bruising.

422
00:32:46,675 --> 00:32:49,720
Junkies usually bruise if
you breathe on them too hard.

423
00:32:49,761 --> 00:32:52,681
She is a pile of twigs, very frail.

424
00:32:54,224 --> 00:32:55,184
What?

425
00:32:56,894 --> 00:32:58,187
I haven't seen you for a while, have I?

426
00:32:59,021 --> 00:33:00,063
You see me every day.

427
00:33:13,744 --> 00:33:14,411
It's all yours.

428
00:33:14,828 --> 00:33:15,579
Thanks.

429
00:33:16,205 --> 00:33:18,999
So, we're looking for clown sex...

430
00:33:19,958 --> 00:33:21,043
...and clown murder.

431
00:33:50,697 --> 00:33:53,826
This fabric is consistent with the
fibers we found in Doodles' nose.

432
00:33:58,580 --> 00:34:01,166
You notice how everything matches
except this one pillow sham?

433
00:34:03,335 --> 00:34:04,002
Yeah.

434
00:34:08,632 --> 00:34:10,968
The white-faced clown
with a pillow covering

435
00:34:10,968 --> 00:34:13,136
his face. There must've
been some transfer.

436
00:34:13,428 --> 00:34:17,099
If a pillowcase like that had grease
paint on it, would you throw it out?

437
00:34:17,808 --> 00:34:19,101
I'd clean it first.

438
00:35:21,997 --> 00:35:26,043
You lied about driving the clown
home. He was in your bedroom.

439
00:35:28,670 --> 00:35:31,965
DNA on his boxer shorts indicates
that you had sex with him.

440
00:35:33,091 --> 00:35:36,595
We checked with the Buddy Ween Agency,

441
00:35:36,929 --> 00:35:40,432
and, uh, you hire clowns on a fairly

442
00:35:40,432 --> 00:35:44,728
regular basis: Four,
five, six times a year.

443
00:35:45,145 --> 00:35:46,855
That's a lot of clowns.

444
00:35:48,065 --> 00:35:51,401
I already told you. I like clowns.

445
00:35:52,110 --> 00:35:53,779
I think you like them
more than most people.

446
00:36:03,038 --> 00:36:05,791
Mr. Maguire, I hate to tell
you this, but while you were

447
00:36:05,833 --> 00:36:08,627
off driving the other kiddies
home, your wife was doing the clown.

448
00:36:09,294 --> 00:36:12,756
We figured you must've walked
in on them... in flagrante.

449
00:36:16,426 --> 00:36:17,719
My wife!

450
00:36:28,146 --> 00:36:31,817
You stripped the body and
dumped it in an area frequented

451
00:36:31,859 --> 00:36:35,487
by transvestites, hoping
that it would just... go away.

452
00:36:36,029 --> 00:36:41,743
Another forgotten sex crime.
You covered your tracks. You

453
00:36:41,785 --> 00:36:44,746
cleaned the house. You washed

454
00:36:44,788 --> 00:36:48,959
that pillowcase. What I
don't understand, though...

455
00:36:53,755 --> 00:36:55,215
why did you keep the clown suit?

456
00:37:01,597 --> 00:37:06,059
You don't understand. Merrill and
I have been married nine years.

457
00:37:06,101 --> 00:37:07,436
We have two kids.

458
00:37:07,477 --> 00:37:09,021
Not much left to get excited about?

459
00:37:11,857 --> 00:37:13,609
I love my wife.

460
00:37:14,860 --> 00:37:16,862
When Al wore the suit...

461
00:37:17,029 --> 00:37:22,659
it worked... and it was good.

462
00:37:24,578 --> 00:37:26,914
If you found something
that got you off...

463
00:37:28,415 --> 00:37:29,708
wouldn't you keep it?

464
00:37:33,921 --> 00:37:37,799
Man, there is something so heartbreaking
about a woman with raggedy drawers.

465
00:37:37,841 --> 00:37:38,967
Mm-hmm.

466
00:37:43,263 --> 00:37:46,558
Grissom. We've gone through
all Mindy's stuff twice.

467
00:37:46,892 --> 00:37:48,143
There's no trace of blood.

468
00:37:48,477 --> 00:37:50,479
It doesn't make any sense
if she disposed of the

469
00:37:50,521 --> 00:37:52,689
clothes, she's not just
gonna forget about the knife.

470
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:57,945
Hey, guys, got a male DNA skin
sample collected from Mindy's hair.

471
00:37:58,153 --> 00:37:58,946
Burnell?

472
00:37:59,238 --> 00:38:02,574
Yes and no. The blood is Burnell's,
but the skin belongs to another guy.

473
00:38:03,367 --> 00:38:04,368
Do we know who?

474
00:38:04,409 --> 00:38:09,248
The gods of CODIS have blessed
us with a hit: Riley "Boom-Boom"

475
00:38:09,289 --> 00:38:11,792
Renaldo, proud owner of
two assault and battery

476
00:38:11,834 --> 00:38:14,294
charges and a possession
with intent to distribute.

477
00:38:14,336 --> 00:38:16,880
Current occupation: Apartment manager.

478
00:38:17,297 --> 00:38:21,093
What do you bet Boom Boom's estate is
on the corner of Washington and D Street?

479
00:38:22,052 --> 00:38:23,846
Renaldo was Mindy's landlord?

480
00:38:23,887 --> 00:38:28,600
That'd make her a bag-bride...
a strawberry. Paid her rent

481
00:38:28,642 --> 00:38:30,894
horizontally. As long
as a dealer keeps a

482
00:38:30,936 --> 00:38:33,397
strawberry high, the strawberry
does whatever the dealer wants.

483
00:38:42,614 --> 00:38:44,199
Las Vegas Police. Open up.

484
00:38:50,497 --> 00:38:55,460
Riley... you said I could have
a taste when we were done. Riley!

485
00:38:55,836 --> 00:38:57,796
Shut up, sunshine.

486
00:38:58,255 --> 00:39:01,758
Nice. We keep Mindy for a couple of
hours, and you've already moved on.

487
00:39:02,217 --> 00:39:05,721
What's the matter? Lose faith in
Mindy? She always comes back to you.

488
00:39:07,264 --> 00:39:09,141
Guess Burnell was bad for business, huh?

489
00:39:17,441 --> 00:39:21,111
Yeah, old Ed gets enough people in
the 'hood clean, you get no love.

490
00:39:21,737 --> 00:39:24,072
Riley... I need it.

491
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:27,743
I said shut up.

492
00:39:32,164 --> 00:39:36,126
Mindy didn't need it anymore, right?
That's why you helped her remember.

493
00:39:39,671 --> 00:39:41,590
I don't need that anymore.

494
00:39:44,676 --> 00:39:46,345
What do you mean, you don't need it?

495
00:39:46,386 --> 00:39:48,347
Just one more, and that's it.

496
00:39:50,974 --> 00:39:52,684
Burnell wasn't hard to find, was he?

497
00:39:54,478 --> 00:39:58,023
Yo, man... that jackass who be
messin' with Mindy is back...

498
00:40:09,284 --> 00:40:11,119
You've got nothing on me.

499
00:40:11,161 --> 00:40:14,998
Yeah, we do: Burnell's
blood on your skin.

500
00:40:15,749 --> 00:40:17,835
So, come on, let's go, let's
go. Come on, you have the

501
00:40:17,876 --> 00:40:20,003
right to remain silent.
Anything you say...

502
00:40:20,045 --> 00:40:21,421
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

503
00:40:25,717 --> 00:40:27,010
It's her choice, right?

504
00:40:28,554 --> 00:40:29,847
Unfortunately.

505
00:40:32,140 --> 00:40:34,017
What do you want to
do, take her to lock up?

506
00:40:35,102 --> 00:40:37,312
Lateral move. She's already there.

507
00:40:55,831 --> 00:40:59,209
One guy's dead. One guy's going to jail.

508
00:41:03,130 --> 00:41:04,339
Well, you're free to go.

509
00:41:06,675 --> 00:41:07,676
Go where?

510
00:41:35,621 --> 00:41:36,705
You got my message.

511
00:41:37,372 --> 00:41:42,544
Yeah. You sounded hungry. I was
thinking... dinner at the Bellagio.

512
00:41:44,213 --> 00:41:45,255
All right.

513
00:41:52,638 --> 00:41:53,972
What are you in the mood for?

514
00:41:55,474 --> 00:41:56,683
Room service.
