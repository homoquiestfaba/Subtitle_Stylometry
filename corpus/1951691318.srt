1
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:15,716
My wife has been kidnapped.

2
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:19,475
There's no ransom that I can pay.

3
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:22,476
There is only the hope of rescue.

4
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:26,236
Yet, in spite of every attempt I've made,
in spite of heroic attempts...

5
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:29,636
that others have made,
she remains a prisoner.

6
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:31,914
A hostage.

7
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:36,398
And I don't know
how this story is going to end.

8
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:41,438
<i>I first met Milly way back in the '60s...</i>

9
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:45,189
<i>when I was starting out as a cub</i>
<i>reporter for the</i> Chicago Sun-Times.

10
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:48,394
The issue is this:

11
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:52,479
<i>The government wants this university...</i>

12
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:54,875
<i>to turn over all the academic rankings...</i>

13
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,912
<i>of its male students</i>
<i>who are eligible for the draft.</i>

14
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:00,236
<i>They want to take</i>
<i>the lower-ranking students...</i>

15
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:03,397
<i>and make soldiers out of them,</i>
<i>while the students with better grades...</i>

16
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:06,353
<i>get to stay on here for a while</i>
<i>until the other ones get killed.</i>

17
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:10,753
- <i>It is pretty bad, right?</i>
- Yeah!

18
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:12,313
<i>Now, I've got to ask the question...</i>

19
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:14,715
<i>wasn't this supposed to be</i>
<i>a democracy?</i>

20
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:22,828
<i>Everybody, stay calm, all right?</i>
<i>Everyone, stay calm.</i>

21
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:25,758
- All right, let's settle down here!
- <i>You have a right to protest here.</i>

22
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:27,916
- <i>It's your right to free assembly.</i>
- Get off the stairs.

23
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:35,232
<i>He's got a right to free assembly here.</i>
<i>This is a peaceful demonstration.</i>

24
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:37,555
- Get that out of here.
- We're not doing anything illegal.

25
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:38,999
Ma'am, you're gonna
have to come with me.

26
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:40,109
We have a right to assemble.

27
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:41,992
Okay, we can do this the easy way
or the hard way.

28
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:43,235
I'm not going anywhere.

29
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:45,396
- Put your hands behind your...
- We have the right to...

30
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:47,909
You have no business
doing this right now. You're a fascist.

31
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:51,999
Hands behind your back. All right.
Let's go.

32
00:01:56,400 --> 00:02:00,154
- So, if your name is Millicent Martinez...
- Martinez.

33
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:04,075
Martinez. Why did I bail out
Rita Torres?

34
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:06,317
Because I didn't want to give them
my own name.

35
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:11,033
I'd like to work for the Cook County
Juvenile Court once I get my master's.

36
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:14,238
You didn't have to bail me out,
you know.

37
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:16,112
- You should never have done that.
- Your master's?

38
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:17,878
- In what?
- Social work.

39
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:19,912
So let Rita Torres get the record.

40
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:22,554
- It was almost Rita Ginsberg.
- Ginsberg?

41
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:24,477
In honour of my mother.

42
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:30,390
I'm paying you back, you know.
Every penny.

43
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:36,634
- So your mother's name was Ginsberg.
- No. But she was Jewish.

44
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:41,514
So what are you?

45
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:42,629
- What am I?
- Yeah.

46
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:45,274
I'm part Mexican, part Catholic,
part Jewish...

47
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:48,278
and I just got arrested
for exercising my right to free speech.

48
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,355
I'm Millicent Martinez.

49
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:56,319
This is an interview, right? Not a date.

50
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:59,159
Because you didn't ask me for a date,
you asked me for an interview.

51
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:02,317
No, yeah, no... yeah.
Sure, it's an interview.

52
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:03,998
Then why aren't you
writing anything down?

53
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:16,636
I just have to wonder about the college
kids who flock to these radical groups...

54
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:19,638
just because, you know,
suddenly it's hip to do that.

55
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:22,713
And I have to wonder about people
who call themselves journalists...

56
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:25,991
and make snap judgements based upon
appearances without careful...

57
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:28,156
and impartial investigation.

58
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:33,713
Boy, you really like the last word,
don't you?

59
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:36,629
Big family. What can I say?

60
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:40,869
Yeah. Thank you for tonight.

61
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:47,036
Free speech. Not free love. Call me.

62
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,956
- How many?
- Six.

63
00:03:57,080 --> 00:04:00,675
I've never known anybody
to see the same movie six times.

64
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:02,119
It's a damn good movie.

65
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:06,233
- I would have gladly bought you some.
- No, yours is good. I'm hungry.

66
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:11,236
Who on earth would give you
advice like that?

67
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:12,952
James Weston.

68
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:15,913
He's the Washington Bureau Chief
for the <i>New York Times.</i>

69
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:19,350
He is the gold standard.
Every young journalist in America...

70
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:21,436
I got to meet him.
When he came to Dartmouth...

71
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:24,759
"See who you marry"?
He actually said that?

72
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:28,111
Yeah, among other things. Like "Start
on small papers," and "Work hard."

73
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:29,958
And find a Washington wife.

74
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:32,753
You know, blue blood, Vassar girl,
finishing school. I get it.

75
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:34,757
Actually, I think the finishing schools
came first.

76
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:38,998
But yeah, he did describe a certain type,
and I wasn't about to disagree with him.

77
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,235
He sounds like a snob...

78
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:41,588
- and they all sound like snobs.
- A snob?

79
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:44,598
And you shouldn't want to be like them,
you should want to be like you.

80
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:46,153
And anybody who wants to be
somebody else...

81
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:49,636
let them be Mort Kondracke,
and not someone who's a snob. Okay?

82
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:53,352
- Tony, cook some sense into this guy.
- Hi, babe.

83
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:56,992
- Hi, I'm Mort.
- Morton. It's Morton. I'm sorry.

84
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,269
- Hi. It's Mort.
- Tony.

85
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:00,436
- He's got the best hot dogs in Chicago.
- Nice.

86
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:02,915
Two with the works
and a couple Yoo-hoos.

87
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:04,314
Right.

88
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:08,236
This is my sister, Alex.
She lives in London with her husband.

89
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:15,269
What?

90
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:16,875
Nothing.

91
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:21,312
This is my mother. Ida.
She was so beautiful.

92
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:24,273
Everyone used to say she looked like
Ava Gardner. I think so, too.

93
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:25,992
She was so beautiful.

94
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:29,754
But she had a breakdown
and she ran away.

95
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:36,989
This is my father. This is Refugio.

96
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:40,550
He was an organiser
for the United Packing House Workers.

97
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:44,309
The union was communist,
so they said he was communist, too.

98
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:46,198
So they deported him.

99
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:50,313
The last time I saw him was through
a gate at the train station. I was ten.

100
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:52,950
About three days later
he died of a heart attack.

101
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:56,711
He was so strong. He was brave...

102
00:05:57,080 --> 00:06:00,197
and he always smelt of cigarettes,
I remember that.

103
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:05,234
And I could always feel him with me,
every day.

104
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,636
And I'd talk to him at night in my room.

105
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:11,398
And I miss him so.

106
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:36,189
<i>With a war on overseas</i>
<i>and a civil rights movement at home...</i>

107
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:38,117
<i>there was no shortage</i>
<i>of stories out there...</i>

108
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:40,356
<i>and I was determined to get on them.</i>

109
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:42,835
<i>But I kept getting kicked back to Metro.</i>

110
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:46,352
<i>I was on the sidelines of life,</i>
<i>while Milly, as always...</i>

111
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:48,152
<i>was right in the middle.</i>

112
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:17,599
- Hi.
- Hi.

113
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:20,314
We just organised
the probation officers into a union.

114
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:22,749
The chief judge fired everybody
at the Audy Home.

115
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:24,313
The place where they put
the problem kids?

116
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:25,429
- Yeah.
- What?

117
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:28,597
So I had to call the state representative
and get them all reinstated.

118
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,551
- And?
- And he did it.

119
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:34,595
How about you, how was your day, huh?

120
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:16,758
- Hi. I'm Norma.
- Hi.

121
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:19,315
I've known Milly since third grade.
Mind if I sit?

122
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:22,318
- Hi. No, sure. I'm Mort.
- I knew that.

123
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:25,633
Are you all right?

124
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:28,032
You're looking a little uneasy.

125
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:31,278
No, I'm, you know,
just, maybe a little out of place.

126
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:33,709
Nonsense. You're welcome here.

127
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:38,837
So, Milly did all this?

128
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:41,271
The Dons were already around...

129
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:45,029
they wanted to call the girls
the Donettes. Milly said, "No way."

130
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:46,878
The Roulettes.

131
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,911
So the girls made her president.

132
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:51,998
She made all the rules.
She gave us a purpose.

133
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:05,311
That's Carlos. He and Milly had a thing,
but not anymore. Not to worry.

134
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:10,318
- Marry her, Mort.
- What?

135
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:12,114
Marry Milly.

136
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:17,118
Boy, do you always go around giving
people advice you've never met?

137
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:19,549
I do when it's the right advice.

138
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,753
Okay, so she didn't go to Vassar,
so what?

139
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:31,432
- Who said anything about Vassar?
- You did. Milly told me.

140
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:35,359
- No, all I meant was...
- Mort.

141
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:38,715
Marry her.

142
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:45,030
Police brutality! Stop police brutality.

143
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:48,755
- I got promoted, kind of, today.
- What do you mean, promoted?

144
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:51,835
Covering politics now.
There's no more Metro.

145
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:54,793
That's great, that's great!
Because this mayor of ours...

146
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:56,478
somebody's got to hold
his feet to the fire.

147
00:09:56,600 --> 00:10:00,070
It's in Washington. Politics.
It's not local.

148
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:03,718
How are you going to cover
Washington politics from Chicago?

149
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:11,992
It's what I'm interested in, Milly.
It's what I've always been interested in.

150
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:15,433
- I don't buy it.
- What do you mean, you don't buy it?

151
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:17,437
Mort, you know all kinds of things.

152
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:20,757
Dartmouth things, really important
things, I'm sure. But I know people.

153
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:23,599
I know when they're lying,
I know when they're telling the truth...

154
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:25,597
I know when they're phoney
and when they're for real.

155
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:28,314
And that's your weakness, Mort.
You don't know these things.

156
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:30,556
You'll get to Washington
and you're going to find out...

157
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:32,910
and it will all be too late,
because I won't be there.

158
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:34,678
You will die there without me.

159
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:39,473
This is something
I have to do alone, Milly.

160
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:42,194
If I were to bring you along,
if I were to bring anyone along...

161
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:45,517
Who said anything about coming along?
Who would want to do that?

162
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:47,629
Milly...

163
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:50,479
You've made it pretty plain.
I'd be a liability back there.

164
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:54,354
Who wants to be dead weight? Okay,
Mort, go to Washington, be happy...

165
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:56,955
be fruitful and multiply or
whatever it is you're gonna do.

166
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:58,399
Milly, just wait.

167
00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:00,556
If you haven't noticed,
we're doing something here.

168
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:05,872
And in case you're wondering,
we just broke up.

169
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:09,512
Stop corrupt police!
Power to the people!

170
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:19,558
Kondracke, the <i>Chicago Sun-Times.</i>
I've been waiting for over an hour.

171
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:22,990
I know that, Mr Kondracke. I've already
told you, the senator has had a big...

172
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:25,076
- He cares about gun control.
- Of course he does.

173
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:28,351
And since I'm writing a story on
gun control, or at least I'm trying to...

174
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:29,674
So is he. Excuse me.

175
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:31,472
- Thank you.
- Yes.

176
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:34,834
Fred Barnes.

177
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:37,592
- <i>Baltimore Sun.</i>
- Right.

178
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:40,395
Mort Kondracke.
I've read some of your work.

179
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:43,080
- Can't say I agree with it, but...
- Same here.

180
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:46,469
So how did you do that?

181
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:48,869
- How did I do what?
- How did...

182
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:52,316
- Well, how did you...
- See you around.

183
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:12,194
Can I have one with everything,
and a Yoo-hoo?

184
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:14,390
- Hey, Tony, how are you doing?
- Mr <i>Sun-Times.</i>

185
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:15,839
- Yeah.
- Where you been?

186
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:17,996
- Washington.
- You back now?

187
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:21,158
Just for a couple days. I'm here to
help them set up the election coverage.

188
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:39,117
- Close, huh?
- Yeah, no cigar.

189
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:44,994
They don't have hot dogs
in Washington?

190
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:48,588
Hey, now.

191
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:51,478
Not like they do here.

192
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:30,679
It just doesn't make sense.
I'm not supposed to love you. I'm not...

193
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:33,675
I don't want to love you, and then I...

194
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:38,078
I see you in that stupid raincoat with
your legs sticking out, and then all...

195
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:40,119
None of the other stuff makes sense.

196
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:41,434
What do you mean? What raincoat?

197
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:44,438
Well, how many do you have?
The yellow one. That yellow thing.

198
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:48,519
When I went to pick you up in the rain,
and I saw you standing...

199
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:53,755
And everything that I was convinced
that I wanted just went out the window.

200
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:56,348
And I wanted to tell you right
then and there that I loved you.

201
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:02,194
- So you love me, but you'd rather not.
- I'd rather marry you. You know?

202
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:05,829
I'm brushing my teeth the other night,
I had this image.

203
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:09,509
I'm walking down the Capitol steps,
you're coming up and you're...

204
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:13,748
on the arm of this... Someone else,
a senator, and I'm an idiot.

205
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:17,550
And I just don't want to spend my life
being an idiot.

206
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:19,472
So do you want to marry me
because you love me...

207
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:21,716
or because you don't want to see me
marry some senator...

208
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:23,068
who might have a better life than you?

209
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:25,234
Because I love you.

210
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:28,039
Say that again.

211
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:30,474
I love you.

212
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:39,359
And nothing else matters but that.

213
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:46,193
<i>Milly always talked about</i>
<i>how she thought it was fate...</i>

214
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:48,276
<i>that brought us back together.</i>

215
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:52,268
<i>That it wasn't just the day she came</i>
<i>home early when I was back in town.</i>

216
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:55,198
<i>And even though it was no accident</i>
<i>that I was in her neighbourhood...</i>

217
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:57,709
<i>she said it was fate all the same.</i>

218
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:03,315
<i>I just knew for the first time ever,</i>
<i>that I was happy and completely in love.</i>

219
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:07,996
For peace in this world
and justice in this country.

220
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:10,077
For now and forever.

221
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:14,390
- For the rest of our lives.
- For the rest of our lives.

222
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:17,240
I now pronounce you husband and wife.

223
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:19,518
You may kiss your bride.

224
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:42,308
<i>What I remembered most about</i>
<i>that day is finally feeling confident...</i>

225
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:47,069
<i>utterly satisfied that I'd just made</i>
<i>the best decision of my life.</i>

226
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:48,839
<i>And I never regretted it.</i>

227
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:51,717
<i>In sickness or in health.</i>

228
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:06,913
- Carol Bates? Senator Bates.
- That's right.

229
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:09,549
Hi. I was in your office this afternoon.

230
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:11,989
I was hoping we'd get a chance
to talk a little bit about...

231
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:14,953
- the Watergate investigations.
- I'm sorry, and you are...

232
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:16,991
Morton Kondracke. <i>Chicago Sun-Times.</i>

233
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:20,351
- Kondracke? Milly's husband?
- Excuse me?

234
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:22,550
Milly Kondracke.
I was just up in your apartment.

235
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:26,555
What an organiser she is,
a real dynamo. You're a very lucky man.

236
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:29,439
I'm sorry, I have to run,
but I think we will be able to help you.

237
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:44,394
We have to let them know that they
can't keep raising our rents like this.

238
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:49,036
So if we act right now and stick together
and refuse to pay these increases...

239
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:50,912
nobody's going to get thrown out
on the streets...

240
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:53,270
just like they did to the Coopers
and the Ligitas.

241
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:56,551
That's right.
So we need each of you to sign this.

242
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,353
Hey, baby.

243
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:01,718
- So once we go... You all right?
- Yeah.

244
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:05,196
Okay. So once the strike starts,
we have to stay with it, okay?

245
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:07,197
They're going to throw
everything they can at you...

246
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:10,039
and it's going to get messy
and really ugly...

247
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:11,912
and their whole intent
is to get you to drop it.

248
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:21,032
So, Mr Democratic
National Committee...

249
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:23,116
is now reduced to working
in my kitchen.

250
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:25,310
When Mr Committee's wife
is crusading against...

251
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:27,431
rapacious land-owning swine.

252
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:33,470
- It's you and me.
- Mort and Mark.

253
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:36,154
And a bottle.

254
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:44,312
You know, sometimes when I want
to talk to Jill, I call her on the phone.

255
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:58,275
You know, the next time
you talk to her...

256
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:01,233
you should tell her to tell Milly
to tell her friends in Congress...

257
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:04,352
to return my calls.
I can't even get them on the phone.

258
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:06,393
You know, she's got one
in the living room.

259
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:10,151
You know they're going in
on office space together?

260
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:12,871
Two therapists, no waiting.

261
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:19,396
I should be a client. I'd see her more.

262
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:27,069
There's a common area, you know?
There's a whole social hall downstairs.

263
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:28,155
Nobody uses it.

264
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:29,838
People don't wanna meet
in a cold, empty room.

265
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:30,915
They wanna meet in a house...

266
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:33,349
where they can smell cooking
and where there's togetherness.

267
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:35,038
Your idea of togetherness
is a rent strike?

268
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:37,037
Seven families have already had
to move out.

269
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:38,559
Do you want to wait till
there's seven more?

270
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:40,875
No, I'm saying, the home is the home.
It's our home.

271
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,718
The outside world should stay that way.

272
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:45,149
Nobody's breaking their backs
to make us any happier.

273
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:47,191
You keep up that attitude
and nobody ever will!

274
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:55,119
Come here.

275
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:26,879
The next few years were so filled
with activity, it's hard to imagine.

276
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:29,634
Our two beautiful daughters
were born a year apart...

277
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:31,751
and Milly's practice
grew like a brushfire.

278
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:33,871
She was an amazing therapist...

279
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:37,310
and helped people through some
of the hardest periods of their lives...

280
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:38,873
whether they could afford it or not.

281
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,468
Kennedy anticipated
that Orrin Hatch would co-sponsor...

282
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:44,558
<i>And my career was taking off</i>
<i>as I'd always hoped it would.</i>

283
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:47,956
<i>When I arrived in Washington and was</i>
<i>fortunate enough to meet Fred Barnes...</i>

284
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:50,230
<i>we became very close friends.</i>

285
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:52,551
<i>So in addition to the regular</i>
<i>TV exposure...</i>

286
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:54,830
<i>we were both getting</i>
<i>on</i> The McLaughlin Group...

287
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:58,077
<i>we even started our own</i>
<i>television show,</i> The Beltway Boys.

288
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:01,631
<i>But life with Milly was still</i>
<i>life with Milly.</i>

289
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:09,156
Listen, I think the less emotional of us
should start things off.

290
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:12,511
- Fine, as long as it's not you.
- What's that supposed to mean?

291
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:14,870
It means that whenever somebody's
an expert at something...

292
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,309
- you roll right over for them.
- You're changing the subject.

293
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:18,873
When are you gonna learn that
it's almost...

294
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,194
always the experts who mess up?

295
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:21,719
Always. Right.

296
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:24,908
Okay, not always,
and it's not even the experts.

297
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:27,793
It's the people who swallow
whatever they have to dish out.

298
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:30,070
We have to go in here united.

299
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:33,272
We are united. We just disagree.

300
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:36,555
Okay.

301
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:45,150
- No, absolutely not.
- We tested her twice, Mrs Kondracke.

302
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:46,713
- Listen to me...
- And both times...

303
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:47,795
Listen to me, you're not...

304
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:50,036
...she came away
with exactly the same...

305
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:53,072
Look, you're not putting her
in a special class, okay?

306
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:56,314
She needs to stay with the kids
she's with right now.

307
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:57,919
She is every bit as smart as they are.

308
00:20:58,040 --> 00:21:00,952
But without the ability to read,
Mrs Kondracke.

309
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:03,150
She has the ability and she can read.

310
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:05,874
Milly, let's just first listen
to what they have to say.

311
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,514
- Then we can...
- No, no. There's something wrong here.

312
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:11,154
Listen, you segregate these kids
into two groups...

313
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:13,919
the smart ones and the dumb ones,
and then you mark them for life.

314
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:16,873
And Andrea is not dumb,
and I'll bet the other ones aren't, either.

315
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:21,069
We test them, Mrs Kondracke.
We test them extensively.

316
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:25,159
I do not randomly group people
by my own personal whimsy.

317
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:28,078
So test her again, or use better tests...

318
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:32,591
because this girl last year was doing
math two grade levels above her own.

319
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:35,479
She learnt to tell time
before her older sister could.

320
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:37,989
- There's nothing slow in that.
- Mrs Kondracke...

321
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:40,236
She needs to be taught.

322
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:43,193
- And you people are either too lazy or...
- Milly.

323
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:46,638
Or you're too ill equipped
to give that girl what she needs.

324
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:49,035
Did you ever consider,
Mrs Kondracke...

325
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:52,436
that it might not be Andrea
who needs to be reached?

326
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,956
<i>But of course, Milly was right.</i>

327
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:04,232
<i>Andrea was dyslexic, and Milly stayed</i>
<i>with her until someone caught it.</i>

328
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:07,120
<i>And I learnt what Milly already knew...</i>

329
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:10,949
<i>that loving somebody isn't enough</i>
<i>if you don't also believe in them.</i>

330
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:14,231
<i>And if you believe in someone,</i>
<i>then you don't give up.</i>

331
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:19,716
<i>And for anyone keeping score, I should</i>
<i>mention that Andrea continued on...</i>

332
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:22,798
<i>to graduate</i>
<i>from Johns Hopkins Medical School.</i>

333
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:31,509
You don't have to be so nervous,
you know. It's just dinner.

334
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:35,315
I'm not nervous. And it's not just dinner.

335
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:37,755
No, it's dinner at the British Embassy...

336
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:39,996
with a group of people
that you're uncomfortable with...

337
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:41,314
because you can't figure out...

338
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:43,590
if you're higher or lower
on the scale than they are.

339
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:46,109
- No, that's ridiculous.
- Because if they're higher than you...

340
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:47,559
then you feel inferior to them...

341
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:49,511
and if they're lower,
you're too good for them...

342
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:52,200
so you end up spending the rest
of the evening talking to me...

343
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:53,958
which is not
what these events are about.

344
00:22:57,400 --> 00:23:00,676
- I like talking to you.
- You won't if you try tonight.

345
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:05,349
Hello.

346
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:07,914
<i>Mort, it's Alex.</i>
<i>I need to talk to Milly right away.</i>

347
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:10,315
Yeah, hang on a second. It's Alex.

348
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:12,476
- My sister?
- Yeah, something's up.

349
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:15,949
Okay. Alex? What's the matter?

350
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:17,035
<i>I've only got a second.</i>

351
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:20,277
<i>A friend staying with us here in London</i>
<i>really needs Mort's help.</i>

352
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:21,674
Who is it?

353
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:37,473
What am I supposed to tell them, Mort?
She's my sister.

354
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:39,909
She didn't ask to stumble
onto an international incident.

355
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:43,953
I know she didn't ask to. I'm just telling
you what my source at State said.

356
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:47,152
If Alex's Bulgarian poet friend
wants to defect...

357
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:49,840
he has to get himself
to the embassy in London.

358
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:51,313
They can't go pick him up.

359
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:54,398
Did you tell them he might get killed
if they find him on the streets?

360
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:56,476
Milly, I did everything I could.

361
00:23:56,600 --> 00:24:00,275
No, you did what you're comfortable
doing. You made one phone call.

362
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:02,636
You need to act
like you're not afraid to act.

363
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:05,479
- I'm not afraid to act.
- So prove it.

364
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:08,595
Your breath smells like whiskey.

365
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:27,554
Peter.

366
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:32,308
What're they doing down at spy central,
you're hanging out here?

367
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:37,071
I can't help your friend, Mort.
Excuse me. I'll have a merlot, please.

368
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:42,076
- Sorry, sir. Tonight we have cabernet.
- Excellent. I will have a merlot.

369
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:49,955
There's the ambassador.
Why not try her?

370
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:56,195
Thanks.

371
00:24:57,920 --> 00:25:00,115
- I'll be sure to tell her.
- Thanks, I will.

372
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:01,958
- Nice to see you.
- You, too.

373
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:05,637
Thank you so much
for having us this evening. Thank you.

374
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:08,320
- Madame Ambassador.
- Mr Kondracke.

375
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:11,273
I've been told to avoid you this evening.
Nice to see you.

376
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:14,119
Thank you. You got...
We have a bit of a situation here...

377
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:18,518
and I think if I have to write it up, it's not
going to look good as an obituary.

378
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:20,674
I see.

379
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:24,152
- I gave it...
- No, I don't have them.

380
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:26,748
- You've got them, you've got the tickets.
- I don't have them.

381
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:28,871
- There. I have them.
- Yeah. Thank you.

382
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,672
- Ticket, please.
- Hi.

383
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:35,471
The package will be on the plane.

384
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:42,517
Does that mean...

385
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,912
- That was like a spy movie.
- He is a spy.

386
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:52,719
Look at you, you're just all
satisfied with yourself.

387
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:53,795
Are you?

388
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:55,919
Thank you.

389
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:57,952
I couldn't have done it without you.

390
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:02,834
That was like a spy movie. God.

391
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:04,234
Thank you.

392
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:07,515
Hi, Craig.

393
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:13,757
<i>By the fall of 1984,</i>
<i>we could finally afford to move...</i>

394
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:16,553
<i>and Milly and I found a great old place</i>
<i>in Chevy Chase.</i>

395
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:19,478
<i>A dream house,</i>
<i>the kind we'd always wanted.</i>

396
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,480
<i>And Milly planned to redo the garage</i>
<i>and put her office out there...</i>

397
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:22,799
<i>And Milly planned to redo the garage</i>
<i>and put her office out there...</i>

398
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:26,196
<i>so she could keep a closer eye</i>
<i>on our two teenage daughters.</i>

399
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:27,879
- You got to check it out.
- Good.

400
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,639
- Chimney's okay?
- Chimney is better than we expected.

401
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:32,876
- Let's take a look.
- That's just dangerous.

402
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:44,869
I saw this when we got married.
I saw this before we got married.

403
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,833
I just... I guess I thought that...

404
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:50,476
I just didn't want to believe it.

405
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:52,074
But still...

406
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:55,475
I...

407
00:26:57,080 --> 00:27:00,117
Okay, so now that I can see him
for what he is...

408
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:02,109
I don't know what to do.

409
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:16,039
- Yeah.
- Did you hear about the spy network?

410
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:17,355
No.

411
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:19,072
Mum's got
the whole neighbourhood organised...

412
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:20,997
to figure out how to keep us
from having any fun.

413
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:24,112
You know your mother. She goes even
a week without organising something...

414
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:26,629
- she starts to rearrange the furniture.
- It's not funny, Dad.

415
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:28,193
Can you please talk to her?

416
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:31,995
We're not little kids anymore, Dad. We
just want to hang out with our friends.

417
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:33,394
Why can't we just go out somewhere?

418
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:34,509
Why can't she just trust us...

419
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:36,358
and not have networks
of neighbours reporting in?

420
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:38,232
Because that's the way
your mum looks out for you.

421
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:40,920
- You want her not to look out for you?
- Please, Dad?

422
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:44,794
We promise not to take drugs,
or join gangs, or get pregnant, okay?

423
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:46,717
Just please talk to her.

424
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:49,399
Is she inside?

425
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:52,592
- Yeah. And Rosa wants to talk to you.
- Oh, good.

426
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:03,433
- Can I help you?
- Thanks, I'm cool.

427
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:06,115
Okay.

428
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:08,271
You know, you should really get
the organic ones.

429
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:10,555
Organic?

430
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:12,549
The eggs.

431
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:16,875
There's a co-op in College Park.

432
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:20,398
It's like they know the chickens
by name over there.

433
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:22,669
Okay.

434
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:25,518
- Mr Mort.
- Yeah.

435
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:29,189
The <i>señora</i> says I should remind you
about the green card.

436
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:32,637
- But Rosie, you have a green card.
- For my brother.

437
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:37,279
Oh, yeah. Okay. Right, right.

438
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:39,115
Yeah.

439
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:47,032
Do you have someplace to go?

440
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:50,470
Yeah, my sister-in-law.
Yeah, I'm close to her.

441
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:54,757
- But that's his sister.
- You can stay here.

442
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:01,999
Excuse me. I'm sorry.

443
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:07,949
We need to talk.

444
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:09,354
I'm with somebody, Mort. Can this wait?

445
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:11,914
No. I walk into the kitchen,
there's a total stranger in there.

446
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:14,395
He's criticising our eggs
while he's cleaning us out of them.

447
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:15,555
That would be Caroline's boyfriend.

448
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:17,318
She had to go to Philadelphia
to see her family.

449
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:18,395
Why didn't he go with her?

450
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:20,715
- Because they don't know about him.
- What's he doing here?

451
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:23,274
He's waiting for her, Mort,
to come back.

452
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:26,630
Now I'm working here, okay?

453
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:30,474
Who's Caroline?

454
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:51,675
Really? That's an interesting strategy
for Central America.

455
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:54,915
Okay. So, Peter, how much time
do I have?

456
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:56,792
I can give you a one day head start
on the story.

457
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:58,956
I mean, I'm doing it
because I like your column...

458
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:02,311
- and because you've always been fair.
- Thanks, Peter. I appreciate it.

459
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:04,590
But if it doesn't run tomorrow,
there's nothing I can do.

460
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:08,269
- The exclusive will be gone.
- It'll run. You have my word.

461
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:22,959
So she moved her practise
out of the garage.

462
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:25,753
- Now she's back in her old office.
- To victory.

463
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,719
- Not a victory?
- That's just it. What have I won?

464
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:32,555
She replaces one project with ten more.

465
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:35,911
They all cost money,
which she keeps insisting that we have.

466
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:39,510
You know, it's like those movies
where you cut off the thing's head...

467
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:42,279
and three more grow back in its place.

468
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:47,751
You don't like Sheldon Adler?

469
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:51,034
Sure I do.
I'm drinking his 20-year-old scotch.

470
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:55,833
No, what I don't like is when
contemporaries write books before I do.

471
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:02,032
You all right, Mort?

472
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:04,749
Sure, Fred.

473
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:07,835
Fine.

474
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:10,275
Okay.

475
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:15,113
Look who's taking on
the guest of honour.

476
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,036
We'll talk about this in the car, okay?

477
00:31:56,720 --> 00:32:00,349
How necessary is it, Milly,
you have to pipe up every time?

478
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:03,634
Can no one say anything
and just have it go by you?

479
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:06,069
You want me to just nod politely?
Would that make you happy?

480
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:08,236
I would pay you to nod politely.

481
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:10,716
Half of Washington
is constantly nodding politely.

482
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:12,478
You can't just learn that just once?

483
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:15,034
He completely discounted her, Mort.

484
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:17,879
Sheldon Adler, the big fancy author,
treats her like she's nothing.

485
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,912
And why? Because she says she stays
home and takes care of the kids.

486
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:23,713
Like that's not the contribution.
Motherhood is not a contribution.

487
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:25,398
I'm not going to sit there
and listen to that.

488
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:27,511
- You don't get it, do you?
- I get it.

489
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:29,358
- Go have another drink.
- You don't get it.

490
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:30,435
Have another drink!

491
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:36,029
I get it. You wanted a Vassar girl
and you blew it, buddy.

492
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:38,112
Give me the ticket,
because you are not driving.

493
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:40,151
- You don't tell me what to do.
- Give me the ticket.

494
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:42,510
- You don't tell me...
- Give me the...

495
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:10,395
Mum? Where's Dad?

496
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:14,671
- He's on his way home.
- Why didn't you come home together?

497
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:18,558
There's some behind the couch
in the den.

498
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:19,908
In the den?

499
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:22,117
- And in the basement.
- Where else?

500
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:25,994
- And in the backyard, by the swings.
- He's been busy. Thank you.

501
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:01,074
- Hello.
- <i>Mort, it's Fred.</i>

502
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:04,033
<i>Did you see it?</i>
<i>It was absolutely extraordinary.</i>

503
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:05,789
What?

504
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:08,957
<i>Sheldon Adler went on all three</i>
<i>morning shows and talked about Milly.</i>

505
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:12,959
<i>That whole scene at the party last night,</i>
<i>it was completely unbelievable.</i>

506
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:16,119
Sorry. Say that again.

507
00:34:17,640 --> 00:34:19,995
Yeah, I heard all about
the morning shows.

508
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:23,317
Of course I'm proud of her,
why wouldn't I be proud of her?

509
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:28,672
Yeah, I heard what he did. The great
Sheldon Adler changed his mind.

510
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:30,711
He talks to Milly at a party
and just like that...

511
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:33,308
he sees the world in a whole new way.
It's a wonderful thing.

512
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:35,954
<i>Mort. It's Peter Evans.</i>

513
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:39,874
- Peter.
- <i>I thought we had a deal.</i>

514
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:45,755
- Deal?
- <i>I gave you an exclusive.</i>

515
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:49,196
<i>You said you were going to print it</i>
<i>and you didn't print it.</i>

516
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:51,510
Peter, I forgot.

517
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:53,872
- I'm sorry.
- <i>You forgot.</i>

518
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,070
Yeah, I can, you know, I can take...

519
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:03,316
- That was...
- I know who it was.

520
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:05,074
Did you sleep last night?

521
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:11,519
Anyway, I've been thinking...

522
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:14,029
and what I've been thinking
is that you're an alcoholic.

523
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:18,637
- Excuse me?
- Come on, Mort.

524
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:20,432
Your dad was an alcoholic,
he died from it.

525
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:21,993
Your grandfather
had the same problem.

526
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:26,556
- Why don't you admit it?
- Okay. So the problem isn't...

527
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:29,555
that you just can't go
to a simple book party...

528
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:33,355
without lashing into the guest of honour
and ending up on national TV.

529
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:34,879
The problem is I drink sometimes.

530
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,036
The problem is that you drink
more than sometimes.

531
00:35:37,160 --> 00:35:39,116
You even drive drunk.
You're going to kill somebody...

532
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:40,958
It goes with the territory.
Journalists drink.

533
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:43,469
That is weakness talking,
and I didn't marry a weak man.

534
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:45,352
- I didn't marry a drill sergeant.
- So divorce me.

535
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:47,550
- Don't tempt me!
- Find someone who'll stand by...

536
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:49,557
and be cheerful
while you ruin your life because l...

537
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:50,715
You can marry a sheepdog.

538
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:52,193
It'll wag its tail and do what you want.

539
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:54,834
Maybe it'll stay sober
and have a better memory!

540
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:57,394
All right. You were...

541
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:02,036
I guess we could take the bus.

542
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:06,834
I'll take you.

543
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:34,396
With me. <i>Contigo.</i>

544
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:36,670
No, that's "with you". With me.

545
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:40,117
- <i>Conmigo?</i>
- <i>Excelente.</i>

546
00:36:42,120 --> 00:36:43,075
<i>Boracho.</i>

547
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:44,835
Drunk.

548
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:47,436
<i>Boracho.</i> Just like Dad.

549
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:51,674
What'd you say?

550
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:55,471
Is that what you think?
Are you calling me a drunk?

551
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:56,555
Mort.

552
00:36:56,680 --> 00:36:59,831
No. No "Mort". I want to know.
My daughter just called me a drunk.

553
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:03,395
They think that's funny.
Is that it, is that what you think?

554
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:05,351
- Stop it. You're scaring them.
- Somebody has to.

555
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:08,313
You're just sitting there letting them
talk to their father like that.

556
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:11,591
Everybody else, you'd jump to the front
of the line to defend them, why not me?

557
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:16,111
I don't defend people who are drunk.
I counsel them to get help.

558
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:19,074
You think they would let a drunk...

559
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:21,191
ask questions
of the President of the United States?

560
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:23,390
You think they'd fly a drunk
halfway around the world...

561
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:25,351
to interview the leaders
of 22 different countries?

562
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:28,074
- I don't think so.
- Yeah, I think they do it all the time.

563
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:29,713
And I think you need to calm down.

564
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:33,790
You know, I think you don't want
a drunk staying here.

565
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:38,752
Drunk for a husband, drunk for a father.
What was the word you used?

566
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:40,233
<i>Boracho.</i>

567
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:46,430
You know, I think <i>borachos</i>
should probably stay in hotels.

568
00:37:49,080 --> 00:37:51,389
Till their families learn some respect.

569
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:54,349
<i>Information.</i>

570
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:56,436
May I have the number
of the Mayflower Hotel, please?

571
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:57,993
You're not going anywhere.

572
00:37:58,120 --> 00:38:00,475
You're not the only one who can
spend money we don't have.

573
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:05,156
I didn't go to a hotel that night...

574
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:07,836
but I didn't sleep, either.

575
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:11,758
In the morning,
I called Alcoholics Anonymous...

576
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:15,718
and I haven't had a drink since the day
I walked into my first meeting.

577
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:21,554
So Milly, by being Milly,
had saved my life.

578
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:25,630
Just in time for me to try and save hers.

579
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:38,551
<i>Every year we spent Christmas</i>
<i>in Vermont...</i>

580
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:41,433
<i>with Fred and Mark, their wives,</i>
<i>and the kids.</i>

581
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:43,710
<i>We all looked forward</i>
<i>to closing ourselves off...</i>

582
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:45,398
<i>from the world for a few days.</i>

583
00:38:47,080 --> 00:38:48,991
<i>But the world didn't always stay out.</i>

584
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:54,873
<i>And this was going to be one Christmas</i>
<i>in Vermont I would never forget.</i>

585
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,230
Government setting up different...
All these operations.

586
00:38:57,360 --> 00:38:58,839
- Mort?
- I missed this.

587
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:00,469
You missed what?

588
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:03,433
Everything, all of it, every year.
Everything we do here.

589
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:08,149
Even this same argument that Fred
and Mark are having right now.

590
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:09,872
And both of you are wrong...

591
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,753
but I would have been
right in the middle of it, and I'd...

592
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:16,109
In the morning I wouldn't have
remembered anything about it.

593
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:18,994
Because I was just
floating through this week...

594
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:21,554
like I floated through
everything else and...

595
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:25,116
But you know, I wasn't floating, I was
sinking. I was drunk and I was sinking.

596
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:30,511
And you pulled me out.

597
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:35,796
Because of you, this is orange juice.

598
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:39,956
It's because of you, everything.

599
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:46,194
- To Milly.
- To Milly.

600
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:53,511
But NYU has what I want.

601
00:39:53,840 --> 00:39:56,274
There's what you want
and what you can use.

602
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:58,436
Does NYU have what you can use?

603
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:01,919
It's the number one film school
in the East, Mum.

604
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:03,712
Do you want me to go West?

605
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,992
Alex, I want you to be able to go
wherever you want.

606
00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:10,795
- As long as it's not Vassar.
- What's wrong with Vassar?

607
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:13,229
Mum?

608
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:19,755
Mum?

609
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:21,869
Get Dad.

610
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:26,674
Get your father right now.

611
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,069
What is it?

612
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:35,231
Look at the "K" in Kondracke.

613
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:41,076
- Milly...
- Look at the "R".

614
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:45,076
Okay, you got to help me out here.

615
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:48,630
They're crooked, Mort.
They're crooked, the letters.

616
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:51,755
- They're fine. There's nothing wrong...
- No, you don't get it.

617
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:54,440
Look, they felt crooked. And look at this.

618
00:40:56,280 --> 00:40:57,713
Don't you see it?

619
00:40:59,160 --> 00:41:02,391
- What am I looking at?
- It's the small finger, it's shaking.

620
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:05,389
Something's wrong.

621
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:12,873
Very strange.

622
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,798
<i>And Milly kept insisting that</i>
<i>her handwriting was changing.</i>

623
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:24,435
<i>Then a few months later,</i>
<i>there was a tingling in both hands...</i>

624
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:27,518
<i>and she'd developed a tremor</i>
<i>in her right foot.</i>

625
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:40,152
- So it's just this ulnar neuropathy.
- Believe me, it only sounds bad.

626
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:42,431
Pinched nerve in the elbow.

627
00:41:43,480 --> 00:41:44,595
This should take care of it.

628
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:47,309
Symmetrel?

629
00:41:48,280 --> 00:41:49,508
I've never heard of this.

630
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:51,835
It should remedy the tremors
and tingling.

631
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:53,593
I doubt you'll need to come back.

632
00:41:54,600 --> 00:41:56,033
If you do, I'm here.

633
00:41:57,200 --> 00:41:58,235
Thank you.

634
00:42:00,520 --> 00:42:02,954
We're just gonna have to agree
to disagree on that again, Mort.

635
00:42:03,080 --> 00:42:04,035
For a change.

636
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:05,832
And we'd like to thank
our guests this week.

637
00:42:05,960 --> 00:42:09,396
Join Mort and me next week
when the boys are back in town.

638
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:11,393
- And you're out.
- That wasn't bad.

639
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:13,317
We could've done better
on that second interview.

640
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:14,555
Good guests, though.

641
00:42:14,680 --> 00:42:17,194
Mort, Milly called you,
needs you home right away.

642
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:27,552
I'm not going back to that doctor.
He lied to me.

643
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:30,035
No, we don't know that.
Symmetrel could be for lots of things.

644
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:31,718
No, it's for Parkinson's disease, Mort.

645
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:33,751
What kind of a doctor tricks a person
like that?

646
00:42:33,880 --> 00:42:36,633
I don't think he was tricking you.
There's more than one explanation.

647
00:42:36,760 --> 00:42:38,830
- There has to be.
- I have seen people with Parkinson's.

648
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:41,554
I've counselled them.
Their whole bodies shake...

649
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:45,116
they can't walk, they choke on their
food. I cannot have this disease, Mort!

650
00:42:45,240 --> 00:42:47,834
I'm not taking this medicine
and I'm never going back to that...

651
00:42:47,960 --> 00:42:49,996
- lying bastard doctor again!
- Okay, okay.

652
00:42:50,120 --> 00:42:51,917
- Look, just...
- No!

653
00:42:52,280 --> 00:42:54,032
- Hey, look...
- No, no, no!

654
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:57,311
- No, no "okay", no "look".
- We'll find somebody else.

655
00:42:57,840 --> 00:43:00,513
Okay? We'll find someone else,
I promise.

656
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:02,313
We won't go back there.

657
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,230
- I'll find someone else.
- Yeah.

658
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:12,913
So I'm going to prescribe Sinemet.

659
00:43:13,880 --> 00:43:16,838
Now, the way this works
is a little backwards.

660
00:43:18,520 --> 00:43:21,080
So, it won't stop the tremors?

661
00:43:21,880 --> 00:43:24,030
It might stop the tremors.

662
00:43:25,080 --> 00:43:28,356
If it does, however, then what
that means is...

663
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:29,469
Parkinson's.

664
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,309
I've read about this, and...

665
00:43:34,680 --> 00:43:37,240
the kind of tremors...

666
00:43:37,640 --> 00:43:39,198
that respond to Sinemet
are associated...

667
00:43:39,320 --> 00:43:43,438
with Parkinson's disease,
so if I take this and...

668
00:43:44,200 --> 00:43:46,839
the tremors stop, that's what it means.

669
00:43:47,160 --> 00:43:49,151
That's what I have, right?

670
00:43:51,560 --> 00:43:53,073
That's right, yes.

671
00:43:59,960 --> 00:44:01,075
Okay.

672
00:44:03,960 --> 00:44:05,757
Guess who's going to China?

673
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:09,799
Air Force One. Me and Ron.

674
00:44:17,400 --> 00:44:19,868
Every letter is perfect and smooth.

675
00:44:23,600 --> 00:44:26,034
That doesn't have to mean it.

676
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:28,392
It doesn't have to mean what they say.

677
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:33,755
Right?

678
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:36,235
Hey, hey.

679
00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:49,192
- People die from this, don't they?
- Yeah. Some do, but not everybody.

680
00:44:50,600 --> 00:44:53,751
Lots of people live with Parkinson's
for 30 or 40 years.

681
00:44:54,120 --> 00:44:55,712
Yeah, but how?

682
00:44:55,840 --> 00:44:57,990
Well, that's the point.
I mean, we just don't know yet...

683
00:44:58,120 --> 00:45:00,998
how it's going to affect each person
individually, so...

684
00:45:01,120 --> 00:45:03,315
your mum might have
the lightest case of it in the world.

685
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:04,589
She might not have it at all.

686
00:45:06,080 --> 00:45:07,274
So I...

687
00:45:07,560 --> 00:45:09,710
I think we should just try
and stay optimistic.

688
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:12,633
I'm going to medical school.

689
00:45:16,200 --> 00:45:17,519
Well, I am.

690
00:45:28,320 --> 00:45:29,833
Milly, it's the middle of the night.

691
00:45:29,960 --> 00:45:32,269
- Go back to bed.
- Well, I'll rub the cramps out for you.

692
00:45:33,520 --> 00:45:35,238
I work all day.
I have a full day of clients.

693
00:45:35,360 --> 00:45:37,032
When am I supposed
to clean this house?

694
00:45:37,160 --> 00:45:39,355
You're not supposed to clean the house.
Rosa does that.

695
00:45:39,480 --> 00:45:40,674
You're supposed to get some rest.

696
00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:43,993
I hate this vacuum.

697
00:45:45,600 --> 00:45:47,830
The doctors say rest
and conserve your energy...

698
00:45:47,960 --> 00:45:50,520
and then you start these
night workshops at Anacostia.

699
00:45:50,640 --> 00:45:53,279
- That's 'cause there's a need.
- No, what you need...

700
00:45:53,400 --> 00:45:55,755
is to conserve your energy,
and what you need is to cut back.

701
00:45:55,880 --> 00:45:57,279
If I do that, my clients will quit.

702
00:45:57,400 --> 00:45:58,674
No, your clients aren't going to quit.

703
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:00,199
They love you.
They're not going anywhere...

704
00:46:00,320 --> 00:46:02,470
but you should start thinking
about seeing fewer of them.

705
00:46:03,120 --> 00:46:06,590
Honey, you almost fainted yesterday.
Your blood pressure's out of control.

706
00:46:07,600 --> 00:46:10,592
I mean, you're losing weight
you can't afford to lose.

707
00:46:10,720 --> 00:46:12,551
Then you start with these
new projects...

708
00:46:12,680 --> 00:46:14,238
that you don't have
the strength to finish.

709
00:46:14,360 --> 00:46:17,033
- What are you trying to say?
- I'm trying to say, slow down.

710
00:46:17,160 --> 00:46:19,310
And I want you to go to NIH.

711
00:46:19,880 --> 00:46:22,474
They are the pros,
and they'll figure it out.

712
00:46:22,600 --> 00:46:24,318
We're not going to find
a cure for Parkinson's...

713
00:46:24,440 --> 00:46:25,759
in the Whole Earth Catalogue.

714
00:46:25,880 --> 00:46:27,836
And we will at the
National Institute of Health?

715
00:46:27,960 --> 00:46:29,154
No, you know what I mean.

716
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:32,397
Just agree with me for once,
just agree with me.

717
00:46:33,120 --> 00:46:34,553
Say I'm right.

718
00:46:35,240 --> 00:46:37,515
Then I'll do your other leg,
and we can go to sleep.

719
00:46:39,440 --> 00:46:40,634
What I'm more concerned with...

720
00:46:40,760 --> 00:46:42,876
is the effect that
all these medications are having.

721
00:46:43,960 --> 00:46:46,952
Principally, I'm seeing dehydration...

722
00:46:47,080 --> 00:46:50,436
which alone is enough to interfere
with the Sinemet's ability to do its job.

723
00:46:50,560 --> 00:46:52,039
So what do we do?

724
00:46:52,200 --> 00:46:54,589
I think we should go back to zero.

725
00:46:54,720 --> 00:46:56,756
Take you off everything, gradually.

726
00:46:56,880 --> 00:47:00,077
Then start again with the Sinemet,
in precise, measured doses...

727
00:47:00,200 --> 00:47:01,758
until we can determine what's ideal.

728
00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:04,632
We'll have to check you in here, though.

729
00:47:04,760 --> 00:47:06,432
Let's figure on two weeks.

730
00:47:07,520 --> 00:47:09,875
- Not possible.
- Milly, if that's what he says...

731
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:13,072
- that's what we should do.
- No, I'm sorry, okay?

732
00:47:13,960 --> 00:47:16,349
- I have clients.
- Too many people count on me.

733
00:47:16,480 --> 00:47:17,959
You want clients 10 years from now?

734
00:47:26,520 --> 00:47:28,750
Good afternoon, Mrs Kondracke.

735
00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:34,159
Blood pressure time. Oh, my God!

736
00:47:36,320 --> 00:47:38,993
Room 707, now!

737
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,833
No, this can't happen.
This can't happen ever again.

738
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:44,109
She was like a living corpse.

739
00:47:44,240 --> 00:47:46,196
- Part of the strategy...
- I want her back on the Sinemet...

740
00:47:46,320 --> 00:47:47,833
yesterday and don't you give me...

741
00:47:47,960 --> 00:47:51,032
- a reason why that can't be done.
- Right. We can do that.

742
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:53,999
But Mort, there's something else.

743
00:47:55,480 --> 00:47:58,313
Milly's situation is more complicated
than most.

744
00:47:58,440 --> 00:48:00,112
A tenth of the people we test
for Parkinson's...

745
00:48:00,240 --> 00:48:02,993
come under a category we've been
calling Parkinson's Plus.

746
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:07,117
We know very little about it.
Or how to treat it.

747
00:48:11,640 --> 00:48:15,076
After about a week,
Milly came home again, but...

748
00:48:16,040 --> 00:48:18,759
she was never the same after that.

749
00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:23,637
She had less control over her body,
and her speech was getting worse.

750
00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:27,189
And sometimes she'd get
so depressed that...

751
00:48:27,320 --> 00:48:30,551
she'd talk about killing herself,
and then in the next breath she'd...

752
00:48:30,680 --> 00:48:34,673
bring in a new client or add
some other project to take on, and...

753
00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:38,395
nothing I said, nothing anybody said,
could slow her down.

754
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:41,355
All I'm saying is that if Rosa
hadn't called the ambulance...

755
00:48:41,480 --> 00:48:43,436
you'd be sitting on the bottom
of the porch right now.

756
00:48:43,560 --> 00:48:44,515
You're totally overreacting...

757
00:48:44,640 --> 00:48:46,949
...drive yourself to the hospital.
- I slipped on the stairs.

758
00:48:47,080 --> 00:48:49,036
<i>And that's when we learnt that</i>
<i>one of the features...</i>

759
00:48:49,160 --> 00:48:51,958
<i>of Parkinson's Plus</i>
<i>is the loss of balance...</i>

760
00:48:52,080 --> 00:48:54,435
<i>and from that point on,</i>
<i>Milly would trip over kerbs...</i>

761
00:48:54,560 --> 00:48:57,870
<i>over carpets, over anything</i>
<i>or nothing at all.</i>

762
00:48:58,960 --> 00:49:02,839
On days when it's wet,
you should take the car...

763
00:49:02,960 --> 00:49:04,029
to the back...

764
00:49:04,160 --> 00:49:05,434
I know, I'm sorry.

765
00:49:05,560 --> 00:49:09,030
- Mr Kondracke?
- One bag at a time. Yeah.

766
00:49:09,840 --> 00:49:13,469
- I need to ask you some questions.
- I'll be back in a second.

767
00:49:19,040 --> 00:49:20,598
What kind of questions?

768
00:49:20,840 --> 00:49:24,037
Your wife's injuries, Mr Kondracke,
they raise a red flag.

769
00:49:25,080 --> 00:49:26,354
What are you trying to say?

770
00:49:26,480 --> 00:49:28,869
From our records, this isn't her first fall.

771
00:49:29,080 --> 00:49:31,071
The staff here, they're trained to be
on the lookout.

772
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:33,236
- You think I hit her?
- No, I'm not saying that.

773
00:49:33,360 --> 00:49:35,749
You think that's why she
keeps falling? 'Cause I push her?

774
00:49:35,880 --> 00:49:38,235
Mr Kondracke, domestic violence,
even the possibility of it...

775
00:49:38,360 --> 00:49:40,271
is something that we have to look into.

776
00:49:40,480 --> 00:49:42,152
- Excuse me.
- Mr Kondracke.

777
00:49:42,360 --> 00:49:44,999
Yeah, you're right.
This is not her first fall.

778
00:49:45,840 --> 00:49:48,070
You check with the staff.
Ask virtually any one of them.

779
00:49:55,080 --> 00:49:56,798
What's the matter with you, lady?
You can't see?

780
00:49:56,920 --> 00:49:58,273
I saw you, but my foot moved.

781
00:49:58,400 --> 00:49:59,913
Your foot moved? What the hell is that?

782
00:50:00,040 --> 00:50:01,359
- It...
- What's the matter with you, lady?

783
00:50:01,480 --> 00:50:03,038
It slipped. I don't know what happened.

784
00:50:03,160 --> 00:50:05,071
- Please, I'm sorry.
- What are you, drunk?

785
00:50:05,240 --> 00:50:06,992
It's 10:00 in the morning.
Are you drunk?

786
00:50:07,120 --> 00:50:09,680
No, I have a disease.
I have Parkinson's disease.

787
00:50:10,040 --> 00:50:11,996
I'm sorry.

788
00:50:15,880 --> 00:50:17,791
<i>I'll take cabs and get rides.</i>

789
00:50:19,120 --> 00:50:21,111
I'll move the office back to the garage.

790
00:50:21,240 --> 00:50:24,312
Everything else we can work on.
The medicine, especially.

791
00:50:25,600 --> 00:50:29,479
'Cause every time your situation
changes, so do the treatments.

792
00:50:29,680 --> 00:50:30,999
Yeah, okay.

793
00:50:32,960 --> 00:50:34,188
You're always elusive.

794
00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:38,998
I've lived a good life.

795
00:50:40,440 --> 00:50:41,634
I've been good.

796
00:50:42,840 --> 00:50:44,193
What have I done?

797
00:50:45,760 --> 00:50:48,274
You haven't done anything, Mill.
It's just not the way it works.

798
00:50:48,400 --> 00:50:50,994
I've always believed in God,
so why is he punishing me?

799
00:50:53,640 --> 00:50:55,278
What have I done?

800
00:50:58,280 --> 00:50:59,235
Nothing.

801
00:51:03,160 --> 00:51:05,754
I'm not going to be able to do things
on my own anymore.

802
00:51:08,080 --> 00:51:10,674
And our friends are going
to disappear...

803
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:15,232
and I'll be weighing you down while
you'll be wiping dribble from my chin...

804
00:51:15,360 --> 00:51:17,920
- and dreaming of your Vassar girl.
- No.

805
00:51:18,360 --> 00:51:20,590
Your Washington wife could have
gotten you places.

806
00:51:20,720 --> 00:51:22,756
No, not where I am right now.

807
00:51:24,400 --> 00:51:27,551
You're gonna put me in a nursing home
and you're gonna forget about me.

808
00:51:27,720 --> 00:51:29,756
- No, no, I'm not.
- I can't die...

809
00:51:30,480 --> 00:51:32,755
I'll die like that if you do.

810
00:51:33,160 --> 00:51:35,469
I'll die like that.

811
00:51:37,120 --> 00:51:38,269
Never.

812
00:51:42,280 --> 00:51:43,269
Never.

813
00:51:56,320 --> 00:52:00,871
- I didn't know you were still driving.
- No, she's not, she's not anymore.

814
00:52:01,080 --> 00:52:02,672
But she's still losing her balance.

815
00:52:03,360 --> 00:52:05,316
And then she's having trouble
turning over in bed...

816
00:52:05,440 --> 00:52:07,635
and then she'll turn over too far,
so we ended up...

817
00:52:07,760 --> 00:52:09,910
putting a rail along the side.

818
00:52:10,480 --> 00:52:14,678
But her lips have been pursing.
They're kind of pulling in all tight.

819
00:52:14,840 --> 00:52:15,795
Dystonia.

820
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:19,075
It's not medication,
it's just part of the package.

821
00:52:20,080 --> 00:52:22,548
It's uncomfortable
and it's unpredictable.

822
00:52:22,760 --> 00:52:24,432
And I hate the tremors.

823
00:52:27,920 --> 00:52:29,990
We've been hearing about
cell transplants.

824
00:52:30,120 --> 00:52:33,396
Yes, very exciting.
But, I think, medically premature.

825
00:52:33,760 --> 00:52:35,990
Well, are there any other options?

826
00:52:36,520 --> 00:52:38,397
There is a surgical procedure.

827
00:52:38,880 --> 00:52:40,472
It's called a pallidotomy.

828
00:52:40,600 --> 00:52:42,955
They're doing it at Emory
down in Atlanta.

829
00:52:43,480 --> 00:52:45,948
They use an electrode on a needle...

830
00:52:46,080 --> 00:52:47,718
to probe certain areas of the brain.

831
00:52:48,400 --> 00:52:51,437
The patient is actually awake
during the surgery, helping them out.

832
00:52:52,120 --> 00:52:53,758
I think we should try this.

833
00:52:54,560 --> 00:52:57,199
Milly, there are pros and cons
with this treatment.

834
00:52:57,400 --> 00:53:00,119
On the pro side, there can be
dramatic improvement.

835
00:53:00,680 --> 00:53:02,477
But some patients aren't that lucky.

836
00:53:03,080 --> 00:53:04,069
The brain can haemorrhage.

837
00:53:05,160 --> 00:53:06,639
Some get permanent blindness.

838
00:53:06,760 --> 00:53:08,239
I like the pro side.

839
00:53:12,320 --> 00:53:14,629
There you go. It's okay.

840
00:53:15,840 --> 00:53:18,274
I'm doing it, Mort. I'm going to Atlanta.

841
00:53:18,400 --> 00:53:22,029
Milly, we have to look into it
a little more. It's a serious operation.

842
00:53:22,160 --> 00:53:23,559
You heard what he said.

843
00:53:24,320 --> 00:53:27,551
- There are dramatic results.
- Yeah. No, I heard the other stuff, too.

844
00:53:28,320 --> 00:53:30,515
For some people it's a lot worse.

845
00:53:31,640 --> 00:53:34,234
- I'm not going to be one of those people.
- No, you...

846
00:53:34,440 --> 00:53:36,590
I'm going, Mort. With or without you.

847
00:53:36,720 --> 00:53:40,030
I can't live like this anymore.
I won't, okay?

848
00:53:51,520 --> 00:53:53,238
Mr Kondracke,
she's coming out of Prep.

849
00:53:57,800 --> 00:54:00,678
- Hey.
- Who's got a kiss?

850
00:54:00,800 --> 00:54:02,119
Everybody's thinking about you.

851
00:54:02,240 --> 00:54:03,798
The phone at home's
just ringing off the hook.

852
00:54:03,920 --> 00:54:07,435
Forget about that. How do I look?

853
00:54:07,560 --> 00:54:09,835
- You look great, Mum.
- Sure do.

854
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:11,399
You look beautiful.

855
00:54:12,520 --> 00:54:13,919
Never better.

856
00:54:16,360 --> 00:54:18,237
Buy me some hats.

857
00:54:19,880 --> 00:54:22,235
How many places can I wear this one?

858
00:54:25,800 --> 00:54:27,313
Quit that, now.

859
00:54:30,160 --> 00:54:31,388
Love you.

860
00:54:49,720 --> 00:54:50,709
Fred.

861
00:54:51,400 --> 00:54:52,515
I was in Miami.

862
00:54:52,640 --> 00:54:55,393
Apparently, Atlanta's on the way
to Washington.

863
00:54:56,400 --> 00:54:57,913
- You all right?
- Yes.

864
00:54:58,120 --> 00:54:59,599
I don't know if I can get up.

865
00:55:00,280 --> 00:55:01,793
I'll help you up.

866
00:55:03,480 --> 00:55:04,708
Oh, boy.

867
00:55:12,280 --> 00:55:13,235
So?

868
00:55:13,640 --> 00:55:15,995
You should have seen her. It was...

869
00:55:16,720 --> 00:55:19,598
I mean, I've seen so many things
I never wanted to see.

870
00:55:19,840 --> 00:55:22,400
You know, what I want
is Milly the way she was...

871
00:55:23,760 --> 00:55:27,673
and it just makes me crazy that
she can't ever be that way.

872
00:55:29,160 --> 00:55:32,072
You know, something that
you said to me...

873
00:55:33,080 --> 00:55:36,993
that the best prayer you could
ever make is "Thank you".

874
00:55:37,120 --> 00:55:40,999
And I've been here for an hour and
a half just saying thank you for...

875
00:55:43,080 --> 00:55:44,798
"Thank you for Milly."

876
00:55:44,960 --> 00:55:46,871
"Thank you for the girls."

877
00:55:47,120 --> 00:55:48,678
"Thank you for giving me the
things I need...

878
00:55:48,800 --> 00:55:50,597
"instead of the things that
I think I need."

879
00:55:52,520 --> 00:55:54,750
Then I asked,
"What am I supposed to do?"

880
00:55:56,120 --> 00:55:57,758
And I was so in it. I was just...

881
00:56:01,520 --> 00:56:03,750
I said, "What's your plan?"

882
00:56:05,640 --> 00:56:06,959
"What's my purpose?"

883
00:56:08,960 --> 00:56:09,915
Anything?

884
00:56:10,600 --> 00:56:13,398
You're gonna think I'm crazy, but I...

885
00:56:14,200 --> 00:56:15,758
I heard a voice.

886
00:56:17,680 --> 00:56:18,715
What'd it say?

887
00:56:19,520 --> 00:56:22,910
It's, you know, it's not really a voice.
It's a message.

888
00:56:24,040 --> 00:56:25,712
"Take care of Milly."

889
00:56:28,960 --> 00:56:31,269
That is some purpose, Mort.

890
00:56:33,360 --> 00:56:35,032
I'm going to get this right.

891
00:56:38,080 --> 00:56:39,479
Whatever it takes.

892
00:56:39,600 --> 00:56:43,275
Whatever I have to do. This is one thing
in my life I'm going to get right.

893
00:56:51,440 --> 00:56:52,998
Nurses station.

894
00:56:53,880 --> 00:56:57,395
I'm sorry. You want me to put...

895
00:56:58,320 --> 00:57:00,197
- Dad?
- Hi.

896
00:57:00,320 --> 00:57:02,390
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

897
00:57:02,920 --> 00:57:05,992
I just wonder how many nights
you're gonna be in hospitals like this...

898
00:57:06,120 --> 00:57:09,317
the one people are waiting for,
you know, to come out and...

899
00:57:09,440 --> 00:57:10,759
give them the news.

900
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:14,798
I don't know. I might veer towards
research, stay away from this end.

901
00:57:14,920 --> 00:57:15,875
No.

902
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:18,672
No, you're too good with people.

903
00:57:20,960 --> 00:57:22,712
That's your strength.
It's just like your mum.

904
00:57:27,200 --> 00:57:29,668
Dad, we've got to talk about
the rough stuff.

905
00:57:33,600 --> 00:57:36,751
What's rougher than your mum's brain
being opened up like a can of tuna?

906
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:39,991
Like what happens when they close it.

907
00:57:40,480 --> 00:57:41,754
And if Mum doesn't make it.

908
00:57:44,520 --> 00:57:47,080
What I'm afraid of is we won't just
lose her if that happens...

909
00:57:47,200 --> 00:57:48,269
we'll lose each other.

910
00:57:50,760 --> 00:57:51,795
What do you mean?

911
00:57:53,440 --> 00:57:55,590
Mum's the glue, Dad.

912
00:57:55,720 --> 00:57:57,153
She's what holds us all together.

913
00:57:58,120 --> 00:58:01,669
All I see is everyone going
separate ways, checking in, maybe.

914
00:58:02,760 --> 00:58:05,877
Mum's the gravity. She always was.

915
00:58:06,960 --> 00:58:09,190
I don't want to see us all three sail off.

916
00:58:11,200 --> 00:58:14,033
- Am I that bad a father?
- No!

917
00:58:15,160 --> 00:58:16,957
No, Dad, no. It's just...

918
00:58:18,520 --> 00:58:19,953
Mum's the glue.

919
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:24,195
It's because it comes to her
so naturally.

920
00:58:27,080 --> 00:58:28,399
But I can be that, too.

921
00:58:29,640 --> 00:58:30,789
Sweetheart, I can.

922
00:58:32,040 --> 00:58:34,235
I can learn to be the glue.

923
00:59:04,360 --> 00:59:05,349
Hi.

924
00:59:10,200 --> 00:59:11,155
Little squeeze.

925
00:59:15,040 --> 00:59:16,792
See, that's a grip.

926
00:59:19,880 --> 00:59:21,279
Where are the girls?

927
00:59:21,840 --> 00:59:24,354
They're out. They're buying hats for you.

928
00:59:25,480 --> 00:59:28,631
Not just hats. I want a wig.

929
00:59:29,840 --> 00:59:32,229
Cover my head while my hair grows.

930
00:59:33,640 --> 00:59:35,198
Why don't you just let it stay short?

931
00:59:35,880 --> 00:59:37,950
You let your own hair stay short.

932
00:59:38,200 --> 00:59:40,589
I want long, dark hair.

933
00:59:41,560 --> 00:59:44,199
What's the matter with white?
White will look great.

934
00:59:44,920 --> 00:59:46,273
Go do something.

935
00:59:46,840 --> 00:59:49,308
I don't want to do anything.
I just want to hear you talk.

936
00:59:50,800 --> 00:59:51,949
Listen.

937
00:59:54,040 --> 00:59:56,315
The doctor says you should get up
on your feet.

938
00:59:56,720 --> 00:59:59,917
He must've said that before he put
the Roto-Rooter through my brain.

939
01:00:01,640 --> 01:00:04,473
No, let's show him
what you've got. Let's...

940
01:00:05,280 --> 01:00:07,111
We'll set some records.

941
01:00:46,400 --> 01:00:48,789
<i>After the surgery, they put her</i>
<i>back on the Sinemet...</i>

942
01:00:48,920 --> 01:00:51,229
<i>and there were improvements</i>
<i>right away.</i>

943
01:00:51,360 --> 01:00:55,114
<i>She even allowed me to win the</i>
<i>argument and let her hair grow white.</i>

944
01:00:56,520 --> 01:00:57,873
- Hey.
- Hi.

945
01:00:58,320 --> 01:01:00,675
I spoke to both the girls today.
They can make it to Vermont.

946
01:01:00,800 --> 01:01:02,074
Oh, good.

947
01:01:02,280 --> 01:01:05,477
And I made some calls
about some new clients.

948
01:01:06,240 --> 01:01:08,071
What do you mean, new clients?

949
01:01:08,200 --> 01:01:10,509
Well, not new clients...

950
01:01:10,960 --> 01:01:13,633
old ones. Old ones that need me.

951
01:01:17,080 --> 01:01:19,036
The foundation's fine.

952
01:01:19,160 --> 01:01:21,196
All we have to do is extend it out...

953
01:01:21,320 --> 01:01:22,992
30 feet for the new addition.

954
01:01:23,120 --> 01:01:25,236
We may have to do redo
some of the stonework...

955
01:01:25,360 --> 01:01:27,999
- a couple of fences.
- The new addition?

956
01:01:28,480 --> 01:01:30,152
We need a family room, Mort.

957
01:01:30,520 --> 01:01:32,670
It'll work out perfectly, Mr Kondracke.

958
01:01:32,840 --> 01:01:35,035
There's plenty of room out the back.

959
01:01:35,840 --> 01:01:38,559
<i>But any improvements were</i>
<i>only temporary.</i>

960
01:01:39,200 --> 01:01:43,432
<i>Before long, Milly's symptoms returned</i>
<i>and got worse. She kept falling.</i>

961
01:01:43,560 --> 01:01:45,869
<i>And soon it became apparent</i>
<i>we were going to have to move...</i>

962
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:48,070
<i>to a place all on one floor.</i>

963
01:01:48,440 --> 01:01:51,796
<i>By that time her balance was so far</i>
<i>gone that she needed a wheelchair...</i>

964
01:01:53,160 --> 01:01:57,790
<i>and it broke her heart to have to leave</i>
<i>the house that we both loved so much.</i>

965
01:02:17,320 --> 01:02:18,673
- Hi.
- Hello.

966
01:02:22,080 --> 01:02:23,718
I will call you, okay?

967
01:02:24,680 --> 01:02:26,796
Okay, don't be a stranger.

968
01:02:27,560 --> 01:02:31,109
<i>Rosa, who'd been with us all these</i>
<i>years, was so affected by Milly's...</i>

969
01:02:31,240 --> 01:02:33,674
<i>deterioration that</i>
<i>her own health went bad...</i>

970
01:02:33,800 --> 01:02:35,597
<i>and she couldn't stay with us anymore.</i>

971
01:02:37,520 --> 01:02:39,988
Everything's turning out
very nicely, Milly.

972
01:02:40,520 --> 01:02:41,635
I don't care.

973
01:02:43,200 --> 01:02:44,428
No one will visit.

974
01:02:44,720 --> 01:02:45,914
Sure they will.

975
01:02:47,960 --> 01:02:49,598
Why should they?

976
01:02:49,800 --> 01:02:52,519
- Because they love you.
- Oh, yeah?

977
01:02:52,920 --> 01:02:54,148
And where have they been?

978
01:02:55,560 --> 01:02:57,471
We're almost finished in the kitchen.

979
01:02:57,680 --> 01:03:00,592
Maybe you could show us how you want
the food in the cupboards?

980
01:03:01,200 --> 01:03:04,192
The cupboards.
Yes, I'll show you the cupboards.

981
01:03:05,880 --> 01:03:07,950
I hate this house...

982
01:03:08,080 --> 01:03:11,516
and I hate needing two people
to take care of me.

983
01:03:11,640 --> 01:03:13,596
I took care of everyone.

984
01:03:14,440 --> 01:03:17,591
I hate this life and
I hate this wheelchair...

985
01:03:17,720 --> 01:03:20,029
- and I'll do the kitchen myself.
- No, don't, Milly.

986
01:03:20,160 --> 01:03:22,276
Damn it, Milly,
what's the matter with you?

987
01:03:22,400 --> 01:03:24,277
You're in a wheelchair for a reason.

988
01:03:24,720 --> 01:03:26,358
Oh, sweetheart, I'm sorry.

989
01:03:27,040 --> 01:03:27,995
I'm sorry.

990
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:32,389
Oh, God. I'm sorry.

991
01:03:35,040 --> 01:03:37,031
We're running out of time, Mort.

992
01:03:37,720 --> 01:03:39,358
I can feel it.

993
01:03:43,600 --> 01:03:46,512
No, I'm just saying there's a fine line
between debate and argument.

994
01:03:46,640 --> 01:03:48,790
I'm sure they didn't mind.
You invite them on the show...

995
01:03:48,920 --> 01:03:50,751
and talk all the way across
what they were trying...

996
01:03:50,880 --> 01:03:52,598
- lf they'd had something worth...
- Mort Kondracke?

997
01:03:52,720 --> 01:03:54,073
- Yeah.
- I'm Joan Samuelson...

998
01:03:54,200 --> 01:03:55,269
Parkinson's Action Network.

999
01:03:55,400 --> 01:03:57,311
Hi. Pleasure. This is Fred Barnes.

1000
01:03:57,440 --> 01:03:58,998
- Sorry. Hi, Fred, nice to meet you.
- Pleasure.

1001
01:03:59,120 --> 01:04:01,634
- I'll see you later. Nice meeting you.
- You, too.

1002
01:04:01,760 --> 01:04:04,354
- How can I help you?
- We need each other.

1003
01:04:05,720 --> 01:04:09,759
Annual NIH funding for AIDS currently
comes in at $1,100 per patient.

1004
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:13,754
Next comes cancer at $400,
MS at $150...

1005
01:04:13,880 --> 01:04:17,156
heart disease at $100,
and here we have Parkinson's.

1006
01:04:19,720 --> 01:04:20,869
$34.

1007
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:23,389
And it's the one
researchers know the most about.

1008
01:04:23,520 --> 01:04:25,670
More than Alzheimer's, more than MS.

1009
01:04:25,800 --> 01:04:28,598
Parkinson's is the gateway
to the entire brain.

1010
01:04:28,720 --> 01:04:31,553
Yet when it comes to money, well,
you can see for yourself.

1011
01:04:31,720 --> 01:04:35,235
Why does AIDS get so much?
Because AIDS activists learnt how.

1012
01:04:35,360 --> 01:04:36,429
They're relentless.

1013
01:04:36,640 --> 01:04:38,119
Look at all the high visibility people...

1014
01:04:38,240 --> 01:04:40,435
they've gotten to sign on
to plead their cause.

1015
01:04:40,640 --> 01:04:43,438
You're joking.
You mean, we need celebrities?

1016
01:04:43,560 --> 01:04:45,915
Nike uses them. Why not us?

1017
01:04:47,480 --> 01:04:50,597
So we're waiting for someone famous
and popular to get the disease...

1018
01:04:50,720 --> 01:04:52,233
before we can get
any meaningful attention...

1019
01:04:52,360 --> 01:04:53,839
from the celebrity chasers in Congress?

1020
01:04:53,960 --> 01:04:55,029
It's sad...

1021
01:04:55,600 --> 01:04:56,589
but true.

1022
01:04:57,360 --> 01:04:58,998
I have a question.

1023
01:05:00,840 --> 01:05:03,195
What's in it for you?

1024
01:05:04,800 --> 01:05:07,268
Who do you know who has Parkinson's?

1025
01:05:08,880 --> 01:05:09,995
I know me.

1026
01:05:12,360 --> 01:05:14,715
I know, you can't really see it...

1027
01:05:15,240 --> 01:05:17,276
but everybody gets a different package.

1028
01:05:18,400 --> 01:05:20,709
And I'm just one of the lucky ones,
so far.

1029
01:05:22,960 --> 01:05:25,155
- Joan, l...
- This is where you come in.

1030
01:05:26,160 --> 01:05:28,469
We need you to use
every connexion you have...

1031
01:05:28,600 --> 01:05:29,919
to get every appointment you can.

1032
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:34,117
And then the three of us will go
in there and we'll make our case.

1033
01:05:34,240 --> 01:05:37,277
Me? What do I have to offer?

1034
01:05:37,800 --> 01:05:39,153
Just be yourself.

1035
01:05:39,880 --> 01:05:41,074
That's all you have to do.

1036
01:05:42,200 --> 01:05:43,872
There's no better case we could make.

1037
01:05:53,240 --> 01:05:55,356
Take a look at her chart.
Look at the difference.

1038
01:05:55,480 --> 01:05:57,391
Right now you're looking at
next year's budgets.

1039
01:05:57,520 --> 01:06:00,478
You can fit it in, make it more even,
to save people like Milly.

1040
01:06:01,480 --> 01:06:04,995
And he has to take me
into the bathroom at night.

1041
01:06:05,120 --> 01:06:06,917
He has to feed me...

1042
01:06:07,640 --> 01:06:09,596
because I can't feed myself.

1043
01:06:10,880 --> 01:06:13,030
And I feel like I'm a burden...

1044
01:06:16,560 --> 01:06:18,516
and I don't want to be a burden.

1045
01:06:18,640 --> 01:06:20,676
<i>Joan was right. Milly was a star.</i>

1046
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:24,595
<i>There wasn't a dry eye in</i>
<i>one of those offices after we left.</i>

1047
01:06:24,920 --> 01:06:27,275
<i>But unfortunately,</i>
<i>this being Washington...</i>

1048
01:06:27,400 --> 01:06:28,913
<i>it didn't do very much good.</i>

1049
01:06:29,680 --> 01:06:33,434
<i>There were handshakes and promises,</i>
<i>and that's all they were.</i>

1050
01:06:33,800 --> 01:06:36,473
Where is everybody? Girls?

1051
01:06:37,640 --> 01:06:39,073
- Hi, Grelanda.
- Hello.

1052
01:06:39,200 --> 01:06:40,155
Hello.

1053
01:06:40,760 --> 01:06:42,318
I can take over from here.

1054
01:06:42,440 --> 01:06:45,432
- How'd you guys do today?
- Oh, she did fine.

1055
01:06:45,560 --> 01:06:48,120
- She ate almost everything.
- Oh, good.

1056
01:06:48,240 --> 01:06:50,356
- And she watched your show.
- Oh, no!

1057
01:06:51,680 --> 01:06:52,829
Thanks for staying so late.

1058
01:06:53,600 --> 01:06:54,794
See you in the morning, Milly.

1059
01:06:54,920 --> 01:06:57,639
- Tomorrow.
- I'll see you tomorrow.

1060
01:06:59,760 --> 01:07:01,671
Tell me I didn't read your mind.

1061
01:07:02,200 --> 01:07:04,395
Tell me I didn't read your mind.

1062
01:07:06,080 --> 01:07:08,514
Oh, my favourite.

1063
01:07:13,240 --> 01:07:15,595
You look tonight...

1064
01:07:18,200 --> 01:07:21,829
It's okay, just take a deep breath,
just say the first word.

1065
01:07:23,120 --> 01:07:24,348
Handsome.

1066
01:07:24,960 --> 01:07:27,520
Handsome. Thank you.
Have a chocolate.

1067
01:07:30,640 --> 01:07:31,789
There you go.

1068
01:07:36,560 --> 01:07:38,198
What'd you do today?

1069
01:07:38,880 --> 01:07:41,997
Yoga, and had tea with Jill.

1070
01:07:43,440 --> 01:07:45,237
New classes here.

1071
01:07:48,200 --> 01:07:52,398
Going to redo the office.

1072
01:07:54,040 --> 01:07:55,393
Okay.

1073
01:07:55,640 --> 01:07:57,631
It's a good project.

1074
01:08:02,040 --> 01:08:03,678
You ready for bed?

1075
01:08:06,080 --> 01:08:07,149
Okay.

1076
01:08:12,200 --> 01:08:16,113
One, two, three. There. Here we go.

1077
01:08:22,240 --> 01:08:23,719
I'm sorry I was so late this...

1078
01:08:23,840 --> 01:08:26,308
A generator broke down at the office,
and Fred and I...

1079
01:08:26,440 --> 01:08:29,034
had to completely redo
the whole first half of the show.

1080
01:08:29,560 --> 01:08:30,754
Poor Fred.

1081
01:08:33,440 --> 01:08:35,351
Thanks for the sympathy.

1082
01:08:38,320 --> 01:08:41,915
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

1083
01:08:46,960 --> 01:08:49,269
- Mort.
- Yeah?

1084
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:53,151
I talk to God, too.

1085
01:08:57,720 --> 01:09:01,633
Because I don't have to deal with
any words.

1086
01:09:02,320 --> 01:09:03,753
He listens...

1087
01:09:05,400 --> 01:09:06,799
and He knows.

1088
01:09:26,440 --> 01:09:28,874
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

1089
01:09:30,600 --> 01:09:31,555
It's okay.

1090
01:09:31,920 --> 01:09:33,399
No, it's okay.

1091
01:09:43,360 --> 01:09:45,749
I told you that it...

1092
01:09:46,240 --> 01:09:48,151
would come to this.

1093
01:09:48,760 --> 01:09:51,149
And I told you I'd be here for it.

1094
01:09:51,280 --> 01:09:55,990
I want you to marry
someone nice someday.

1095
01:09:56,600 --> 01:09:58,397
I did that already. Thirty years ago.

1096
01:09:58,520 --> 01:10:00,431
- Listen to me.
- No, you listen.

1097
01:10:00,560 --> 01:10:02,755
You listen, okay?
You always have the last word.

1098
01:10:02,880 --> 01:10:05,269
I'm just going to have the last word
for a change.

1099
01:10:06,640 --> 01:10:08,995
This is the last word: I love you.

1100
01:10:09,480 --> 01:10:12,552
I've always loved you.
I'm always going to love you.

1101
01:10:13,240 --> 01:10:14,514
And even where we are right now...

1102
01:10:14,640 --> 01:10:16,437
I still feel lucky that
I'm the one you married...

1103
01:10:16,560 --> 01:10:18,915
I'm the one you had kids together with.

1104
01:10:20,960 --> 01:10:23,918
I'm glad it's me
and not someone else that's here...

1105
01:10:24,040 --> 01:10:25,632
with you right now.

1106
01:10:29,080 --> 01:10:30,718
You tell me you wouldn't do
the same for me.

1107
01:10:41,800 --> 01:10:45,918
It was Milly who insisted
on another surgery, and this time...

1108
01:10:46,600 --> 01:10:49,433
it was a double deep brain stimulation.

1109
01:10:49,560 --> 01:10:53,439
It was the first one they'd ever done
at Emory.

1110
01:10:54,160 --> 01:10:58,278
But any progress was quickly reversed.
Her ability to speak...

1111
01:10:59,520 --> 01:11:02,239
declined dramatically,
and we tried using...

1112
01:11:02,680 --> 01:11:05,399
microphones with amplifiers
and speakers...

1113
01:11:06,320 --> 01:11:08,959
but her voice didn't even have
enough volume to make...

1114
01:11:09,280 --> 01:11:11,316
them work, so finally...

1115
01:11:11,880 --> 01:11:14,075
because she still had
the use of her hands...

1116
01:11:14,960 --> 01:11:16,996
I rigged up two laptops.

1117
01:11:29,800 --> 01:11:32,155
Don't stop caring just yet.

1118
01:11:33,840 --> 01:11:35,910
I got cruise tickets for Christmas.

1119
01:11:36,080 --> 01:11:37,308
We're going to the Mediterranean...

1120
01:11:37,440 --> 01:11:39,954
and see, I can do projects, too.
You finally got me on board...

1121
01:11:47,840 --> 01:11:49,398
You can't do that.

1122
01:11:49,520 --> 01:11:50,953
The tickets are non-refundable.

1123
01:12:10,320 --> 01:12:12,231
Don't say that.

1124
01:12:18,640 --> 01:12:21,154
Hello. Joan, hi, yeah.

1125
01:12:24,120 --> 01:12:26,759
Yeah, what channel? Thank you. Milly!

1126
01:12:28,280 --> 01:12:31,590

<i>I can still perform my job...</i>

1154
01:14:11,920 --> 01:14:13,717
<i>in my case, in a very public arena.</i>

1155
01:14:15,720 --> 01:14:19,508
<i>I can still help out with the daily tasks</i>
<i>and rituals involved in home life...</i>

1156
01:14:19,880 --> 01:14:22,678
<i>but I don't kid myself. That will change.</i>

1157
01:14:23,400 --> 01:14:26,756
<i>I can expect in my forties to face</i>
<i>challenges most won't expect until...</i>

1158
01:14:26,880 --> 01:14:29,075
<i>their seventies or eighties, if ever.</i>

1159
01:14:29,640 --> 01:14:31,153
<i>But with your help...</i>

1160
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:35,151
<i>if we all do everything we can</i>
<i>to eradicate this disease...</i>

1161
01:14:35,280 --> 01:14:38,750
<i>in my fifties, I'll be dancing</i>
<i>at my children's weddings.</i>

1162
01:14:38,960 --> 01:14:41,713
<i>And mine will be one of</i>
<i>millions of happy stories.</i>

1163
01:14:44,160 --> 01:14:45,832
<i>Thank you for your time and attention.</i>

1164
01:14:46,920 --> 01:14:48,876
How can they say no?

1165
01:14:49,320 --> 01:14:52,278
<i>Maybe it's just the magic of hope...</i>

1166
01:14:52,440 --> 01:14:55,352
<i>or maybe it's the strength</i>
<i>of her new friendship with Michael...</i>

1167
01:14:55,480 --> 01:14:56,674
<i>or both.</i>

1168
01:14:57,400 --> 01:15:00,949
<i>But Milly seems to be gaining strength</i>
<i>in ways that we can't explain.</i>

1169
01:15:01,080 --> 01:15:04,356
<i>Things come back that we thought</i>
<i>were gone for good.</i>

1170
01:15:04,960 --> 01:15:06,552
And so much so that she...

1171
01:15:06,680 --> 01:15:10,070
now feels strong enough to insist
that we fly back to Chicago...

1172
01:15:10,240 --> 01:15:12,470
for the fortieth reunion of her old club.

1173
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:15,560
She's now more determined than ever
to stick around...

1174
01:15:15,920 --> 01:15:19,230
long enough, in her words,
"to see you guys fix this".

1175
01:15:20,440 --> 01:15:23,830
So if Milly Martinez Kondracke,
through all the pain...

1176
01:15:23,960 --> 01:15:27,032
and all the horror, can still have
the will to fight on...

1177
01:15:27,760 --> 01:15:30,433
then you'd better have the will to do
what has to be done.

1178
01:15:31,760 --> 01:15:34,433
To fix it. Find the money.

1179
01:15:36,080 --> 01:15:37,479
Get it done.

1180
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:41,274
Thank you.

1181
01:15:54,520 --> 01:15:56,556
Did you reach Norma, finally?

1182
01:15:56,680 --> 01:15:58,830
- I left her a message.
- Okay.

1183
01:15:59,320 --> 01:16:01,470
But you didn't hear from her.

1184
01:16:01,600 --> 01:16:04,160
Well, no, but she'll probably be here.

1185
01:16:19,080 --> 01:16:20,354
You okay?

1186
01:16:28,160 --> 01:16:30,116
- Norma.
- Oh, Milly. I missed you so, Milly.

1187
01:16:32,440 --> 01:16:34,749
This is the last time I give you
my blessing to run off...

1188
01:16:34,880 --> 01:16:38,111
with a brilliant journalist to Washington,
do you hear me?

1189
01:16:38,240 --> 01:16:40,151
I want you back every spring.

1190
01:16:45,840 --> 01:16:48,354
The Chicago reunion was
the high point.

1191
01:16:50,120 --> 01:16:51,712
It's nature, right?

1192
01:16:53,160 --> 01:16:54,559
What goes up.

1193
01:16:56,960 --> 01:16:59,110
And lately she's just been...

1194
01:16:59,800 --> 01:17:03,236
just dropping like an iron weight.
We did a PAT scan and...

1195
01:17:04,920 --> 01:17:07,354
Iooked like acid was
eating away at her brain.

1196
01:17:08,120 --> 01:17:09,439
Just awful.

1197
01:17:11,480 --> 01:17:15,393
She can barely swallow, so she's going
to need a feeding tube soon.

1198
01:17:16,720 --> 01:17:18,711
Can't move her hands on the keyboard.

1199
01:17:20,840 --> 01:17:23,035
So we're down to hand signals.

1200
01:17:23,160 --> 01:17:25,310
It's one finger for yes, two for no.

1201
01:17:29,360 --> 01:17:31,749
All she wants is for me to help her die.

1202
01:17:36,080 --> 01:17:38,275
And God says, "Take care of Milly".

1203
01:17:40,400 --> 01:17:42,630
If taking care of her means
helping her die...

1204
01:17:46,320 --> 01:17:47,958
how do I do that?

1205
01:17:50,400 --> 01:17:52,436
Mort, I...

1206
01:17:57,640 --> 01:17:59,392
Let's just pray, huh?

1207
01:18:10,520 --> 01:18:12,033
Oh, wow.

1208
01:18:13,160 --> 01:18:14,639
Remember this?

1209
01:18:16,520 --> 01:18:17,873
You know, it took me forever...

1210
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:21,356
to realise that it wasn't just the speech
you gave, it was those tights.

1211
01:18:21,480 --> 01:18:24,756
You were wearing those tights.
I just didn't get it.

1212
01:18:25,360 --> 01:18:30,275
I was such a serious little journalist,
interviewing you.

1213
01:18:32,240 --> 01:18:33,514
But you knew...

1214
01:18:34,280 --> 01:18:36,919
you just knew all along, I was a goner.

1215
01:18:47,160 --> 01:18:50,835
There was nothing ever, anywhere...

1216
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:54,230
more beautiful than you were
on that day.

1217
01:18:57,640 --> 01:18:58,834
Ever.

1218
01:19:11,280 --> 01:19:12,474
Milly...

1219
01:19:18,640 --> 01:19:20,471
I did what you wanted.

1220
01:19:22,040 --> 01:19:23,792
And found it all out.

1221
01:19:27,720 --> 01:19:30,871
And when it comes time for the feeding
tube, you're going to have a choice.

1222
01:19:33,560 --> 01:19:36,028
So if you refuse the tube...

1223
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:41,675
we'll go to a hospice,
and I'll be there every minute...

1224
01:19:46,520 --> 01:19:48,988
and they say they promise
you won't feel any pain.

1225
01:19:52,440 --> 01:19:54,476
But I have to tell you, I hate it.

1226
01:19:54,600 --> 01:19:57,717
I hate it, with everything.

1227
01:19:59,960 --> 01:20:03,157
And I'm praying you don't ask me
to follow through.

1228
01:20:06,120 --> 01:20:07,792
But if that's what you want...

1229
01:20:12,120 --> 01:20:14,759
when the tube comes and that's what
you want, that's what I'll do.

1230
01:20:20,520 --> 01:20:21,873
Is that what you want?

1231
01:20:34,160 --> 01:20:35,115
Okay.

1232
01:20:36,640 --> 01:20:38,551
Okay, my love.

1233
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:44,955
Mort...

1234
01:20:53,680 --> 01:20:56,478
You were...

1235
01:20:57,840 --> 01:20:58,955
my...

1236
01:21:00,080 --> 01:21:01,274
best...

1237
01:21:02,360 --> 01:21:03,509
project.

1238
01:22:02,320 --> 01:22:05,551
Before watching tonight's film
you probably knew a little bit about me...

1239
01:22:05,680 --> 01:22:07,477
probably something about Mort.

1240
01:22:07,600 --> 01:22:11,559
Now you've met Milly,
and I'm sure you'll never forget her.

1241
01:22:12,280 --> 01:22:14,032
I wish I could thank Milly for...

1242
01:22:14,160 --> 01:22:17,118
all the strength and determination
she's inspired in me and...

1243
01:22:17,240 --> 01:22:20,277
so many others whose lives have been
touched by Parkinson's.

1244
01:22:20,640 --> 01:22:23,234
I mean, Milly's whole life
was proof that...

1245
01:22:23,360 --> 01:22:25,590
one's dignity can be attacked...

1246
01:22:25,960 --> 01:22:29,111
cruelly mocked,
but it cannot be taken away...

1247
01:22:30,040 --> 01:22:33,112
only surrendered, and Milly...

1248
01:22:33,360 --> 01:22:34,793
never surrendered.

1249
01:22:35,320 --> 01:22:37,788
Just like thousands of others
who aren't surrendering.

1250
01:22:37,920 --> 01:22:39,831
Nor should they have to.

1251
01:22:40,760 --> 01:22:44,878
In the '80s, doctors said that with
the right attention and resolve...

1252
01:22:45,680 --> 01:22:47,432
and with the funding...

1253
01:22:47,560 --> 01:22:49,391
Parkinson's could be cured
in a matter of...

1254
01:22:49,520 --> 01:22:51,158
five to ten years.

1255
01:22:51,800 --> 01:22:53,836
Now, two decades later...

1256
01:22:54,480 --> 01:22:56,948
they're still saying the same thing.

1257
01:22:57,440 --> 01:22:59,556
Thank you and goodnight.
