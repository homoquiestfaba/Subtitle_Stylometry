1
00:00:42,509 --> 00:00:45,115
(indistinct chattering)

2
00:00:47,881 --> 00:00:50,293
Man: I'm not very interested
in my school days

3
00:00:50,350 --> 00:00:54,355
and feel no special
nostalgia for them.

4
00:00:54,421 --> 00:00:56,594
But I remember Sixth Form.

5
00:01:01,027 --> 00:01:03,166
Good morning.

6
00:01:03,229 --> 00:01:05,140
And welcome to you all

7
00:01:05,198 --> 00:01:07,542
as we begin the new term.

8
00:01:08,768 --> 00:01:10,679
Man: In those days,
we imagined ourselves

9
00:01:10,737 --> 00:01:12,546
as being in a holding pen,

10
00:01:12,605 --> 00:01:14,881
waiting to be released
into our lives.

11
00:01:14,941 --> 00:01:16,978
Headmaster:
From summer to autumn.

12
00:01:17,043 --> 00:01:18,784
So, too, do we think ahead...

13
00:01:18,845 --> 00:01:21,086
(chuckles)
Rather him than us.

14
00:01:22,515 --> 00:01:24,188
Man:
And when that moment would come,

15
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:26,059
we would be at university.

16
00:01:26,119 --> 00:01:28,258
(upbeat music playing)

17
00:01:28,321 --> 00:01:30,426
(indistinct chattering)

18
00:01:32,125 --> 00:01:36,335
How were we to know that
our lives had already begun,

19
00:01:36,396 --> 00:01:40,435
and our release would only be
into a larger holding pen?

20
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:43,674
And in time,
a larger holding pen.

21
00:01:47,841 --> 00:01:50,117
When you are young,
you want your emotions

22
00:01:50,176 --> 00:01:53,123
to be like the ones
you read about in books.

23
00:01:54,781 --> 00:01:57,159
You want them
to overturn your life

24
00:01:57,217 --> 00:01:59,254
and create a new reality.

25
00:01:59,319 --> 00:02:00,963
- (alarm clock ringing)
- But as that second hand

26
00:02:00,987 --> 00:02:04,457
insists on speeding up
and time delivers us all too quickly

27
00:02:04,524 --> 00:02:07,437
into middle age,
and then old age,

28
00:02:07,494 --> 00:02:11,067
that's when you want something
a little milder, don't you?

29
00:02:13,666 --> 00:02:16,010
You want your emotions
to support your life

30
00:02:16,069 --> 00:02:17,605
as it has become.

31
00:02:19,472 --> 00:02:23,215
You want them to tell you
that everything is going to be okay.

32
00:02:24,911 --> 00:02:26,948
And is there anything
wrong with that?

33
00:02:30,350 --> 00:02:32,352
(classical music playing)

34
00:02:44,797 --> 00:02:47,539
"Sir, according to
your recent survey,

35
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:49,773
95% of British motorists

36
00:02:49,836 --> 00:02:52,908
describe themselves
as 'above average' drivers.

37
00:02:52,972 --> 00:02:55,248
But by the law of averages,

38
00:02:55,308 --> 00:02:57,413
we are, most of us,
bound to be average.

39
00:02:57,477 --> 00:02:58,649
Are we not?

40
00:02:58,711 --> 00:03:01,248
Anthony Webster, London.“

41
00:03:14,127 --> 00:03:16,073
(exhales deeply)
Good timing.

42
00:03:16,129 --> 00:03:18,541
Sorry?
(sighs)

43
00:03:19,299 --> 00:03:20,642
(device beeping)

44
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:24,739
Oh, uh, sign there, thanks.

45
00:03:24,804 --> 00:03:28,342
- Lovely morning, isn't it?
- Hmm.

46
00:03:28,408 --> 00:03:29,785
- (device beeps)
- Thank you.

47
00:03:37,984 --> 00:03:39,986
(music playing)

48
00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:52,399
(knocks on door)

49
00:05:02,201 --> 00:05:04,772
- Can I help you?
- Just looking.

50
00:05:04,837 --> 00:05:08,080
- By all means.
- Oh! Wow.

51
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:11,050
These are beautiful.

52
00:05:12,612 --> 00:05:14,148
How much is this one?

53
00:05:15,782 --> 00:05:17,989
£2,399.

54
00:05:18,051 --> 00:05:19,428
£2,000?

55
00:05:19,485 --> 00:05:20,793
Extremely rare model.

56
00:05:20,853 --> 00:05:23,891
- Still works, huh?
- Of course.

57
00:05:23,956 --> 00:05:25,663
How do you source them
on the Internet?

58
00:05:25,725 --> 00:05:27,727
I've been in the Leica business
for some time,

59
00:05:27,794 --> 00:05:29,899
so we have our own
exclusive sources.

60
00:05:29,962 --> 00:05:32,966
"We"?
It's just you, isn't it?

61
00:05:33,032 --> 00:05:34,743
If there's anything
you're particularly interested in,

62
00:05:34,767 --> 00:05:37,111
I may be able to help you.

63
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:38,979
Do you have anything cheaper?

64
00:05:40,406 --> 00:05:42,443
Some Leica Ills, 500.

65
00:05:42,508 --> 00:05:43,851
500?

66
00:05:44,410 --> 00:05:45,980
Wow.

67
00:05:46,045 --> 00:05:48,150
These are the finest
cameras ever made.

68
00:05:48,214 --> 00:05:50,660
People buy them
because they love them.

69
00:05:51,317 --> 00:05:53,024
Well, as they say,

70
00:05:53,086 --> 00:05:55,032
I'd be rich
if I didn't have kids.

71
00:05:56,556 --> 00:05:58,194
You got kids?

72
00:05:58,257 --> 00:06:01,170
- Excuse me?
- I've got two baby girls.

73
00:06:04,097 --> 00:06:07,044
- I have a daughter.
- Oh.

74
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:10,343
Fathers and daughters, eh?
Very special.

75
00:06:18,311 --> 00:06:19,483
Okay.

76
00:06:19,545 --> 00:06:20,546
(inhales sharply)

77
00:06:20,613 --> 00:06:24,584
Well, I'll look you up
when the kids have left home.

78
00:06:24,650 --> 00:06:26,129
Tony Webster.

79
00:06:26,185 --> 00:06:29,098
- Have a lovely day, Tony Webster.
- Okay.

80
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:34,905
(cell phone chiming)

81
00:06:43,469 --> 00:06:44,573
(cell phone beeps)

82
00:06:44,637 --> 00:06:47,174
- Hello, Margaret.
- I'm calling to remind you that

83
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:49,811
this evening you're duty bound
to attend the NCT

84
00:06:49,876 --> 00:06:51,719
with your beloved daughter.

85
00:06:51,778 --> 00:06:53,052
Tonight?

86
00:06:53,112 --> 00:06:55,524
Uh, oh, no, no, no, sorry.
No can do.

87
00:06:55,581 --> 00:06:58,585
Oh, for God's sake.
This should be in your diary.

88
00:06:58,651 --> 00:06:59,686
Susie's relying on you.

89
00:06:59,752 --> 00:07:03,290
You know I can'! Do it
with this thing on my leg.

90
00:07:03,356 --> 00:07:05,097
I'm winding you up.
(laughs)

91
00:07:05,158 --> 00:07:07,502
Somebody's in a playful mood.

92
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:08,800
Always.

93
00:07:08,861 --> 00:07:11,967
Well, don't forget to dig out
something loose-fitting.

94
00:07:12,031 --> 00:07:14,238
Lycra. All-in-one.

95
00:07:15,635 --> 00:07:17,546
Very attractive.

96
00:07:17,603 --> 00:07:19,241
What are you doing this evening?

97
00:07:20,273 --> 00:07:22,253
Working. What else?

98
00:07:22,308 --> 00:07:24,083
Really?

99
00:07:24,143 --> 00:07:26,714
So I'm expecting a full report
in the morning.

100
00:07:26,779 --> 00:07:29,555
- How's the foot, by the way?
- Bye, Tony.

101
00:07:29,615 --> 00:07:32,926
- (call disconnects)
- Hmm, charming.

102
00:07:33,419 --> 00:07:35,092
(cell phone beeps)

103
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:11,526
- (car lock beeps)
- (intercom buzzes)

104
00:08:13,259 --> 00:08:15,569
- Woman: Hi.
- It's me.

105
00:08:15,628 --> 00:08:16,732
You're not Mum.

106
00:08:16,796 --> 00:08:19,276
Indeed, I'm not.
Your mother sent me.

107
00:08:19,332 --> 00:08:22,506
I'm your geriatric knight
in shining armor.

108
00:08:22,568 --> 00:08:25,174
- Can you give me a minute?
- Can I come in?

109
00:08:26,772 --> 00:08:29,514
- (door buzzes)
- Thank you.

110
00:08:32,278 --> 00:08:34,857
Man on radio: The Prime Minister
has insisted Britain will be safer

111
00:08:34,881 --> 00:08:38,522
and economically stronger
if it remains in the European Union.

112
00:08:38,584 --> 00:08:41,064
He said a vote to leave
would cause such instability

113
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,599
on the financial markets

114
00:08:42,655 --> 00:08:45,829
that the UK could be
tipped back into recession.

115
00:08:45,892 --> 00:08:47,769
(turns off radio)

116
00:08:47,827 --> 00:08:51,639
- All right, Dad, let's do this.
- Have you seen this?

117
00:08:51,697 --> 00:08:53,301
I know, I know.

118
00:08:53,366 --> 00:08:54,902
It's the bollocking upstairs neighbor.

119
00:08:54,967 --> 00:08:57,072
- What happened?
- I don't know.

120
00:08:57,136 --> 00:08:58,444
Overflowing bath or something.

121
00:08:58,504 --> 00:09:01,451
- That's ridiculous.
- I know.

122
00:09:01,507 --> 00:09:03,145
Come on.

123
00:09:03,209 --> 00:09:04,916
I'll write to them.

124
00:09:05,745 --> 00:09:08,351
Dad, no one writes letters anymore.

125
00:09:15,187 --> 00:09:18,999
So, I should probably warn you,
tonight will likely feature lesbians.

126
00:09:19,058 --> 00:09:20,162
(Tony laughs)

127
00:09:20,226 --> 00:09:22,763
I've known quite a number
of lesbians in my time,

128
00:09:22,828 --> 00:09:24,171
thank you very much.

129
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:26,039
Artificially inseminated lesbians.

130
00:09:26,098 --> 00:09:30,274
(laughs) I once knew
a pasteurized lesbian.

131
00:09:30,336 --> 00:09:34,716
Just try not to say anything
too mental, will you?

132
00:09:34,774 --> 00:09:36,913
The woman who runs the group
takes the whole thing

133
00:09:36,976 --> 00:09:39,252
- pretty seriously.
- (sarcastic laugh)

134
00:09:39,312 --> 00:09:41,553
I'm sure she does.

135
00:09:43,683 --> 00:09:44,718
(Susie sighs)

136
00:09:44,784 --> 00:09:48,095
Hi, I'm Tony.
I'm this evening's stand-in mother.

137
00:09:48,154 --> 00:09:49,398
Standing in for
the mother of the mother.

138
00:09:49,422 --> 00:09:52,767
You just rock with it.
And you will get a rhythm.

139
00:09:52,825 --> 00:09:55,738
But, uh, not to worry.
I have been effectively sterilized.

140
00:09:55,795 --> 00:09:57,672
But the voice
of experience tonight.

141
00:09:57,730 --> 00:09:59,835
Now the contraction comes.

142
00:09:59,899 --> 00:10:01,936
So... sit up.

143
00:10:02,001 --> 00:10:03,571
Your contraction's coming.

144
00:10:03,636 --> 00:10:07,106
Hi, I'm Susie.
Uh, this is my first.

145
00:10:07,173 --> 00:10:11,087
Um, I'm expecting a boy in October.

146
00:10:11,143 --> 00:10:14,681
Instructor:
You're in the arms of your protector

147
00:10:14,747 --> 00:10:16,988
and your baby,
it is going to be fine.

148
00:10:17,049 --> 00:10:19,290
And I think I'm gonna
name him Joshua.

149
00:10:19,352 --> 00:10:21,389
- Instructor: Oh!
- Really?

150
00:10:21,454 --> 00:10:22,455
Yeah.

151
00:10:22,521 --> 00:10:25,900
Instructor:
We've got another surge that has started.

152
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:27,767
- (bone cracks)
- So...

153
00:10:27,827 --> 00:10:30,330
You okay there, Dad?

154
00:10:30,396 --> 00:10:33,570
So maybe if you come further down.

155
00:10:35,401 --> 00:10:37,142
That's it.

156
00:10:37,203 --> 00:10:38,409
See, this is the other thing.

157
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:40,781
Depends if your partner's agile
or not agile,

158
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:43,286
you know,
or to get into positions.

159
00:10:43,342 --> 00:10:45,982
It's taking them
into consideration as well

160
00:10:46,045 --> 00:10:48,085
and make whatever's comfortable
for the both of you.

161
00:10:48,147 --> 00:10:50,559
(indistinct conversations)

162
00:10:55,988 --> 00:10:57,695
- Me, as well.
- Yes.

163
00:10:57,757 --> 00:11:00,704
It was amazing.
And so much fun.

164
00:11:13,606 --> 00:11:16,883
Wait here a sec.
I wanna give you something.

165
00:11:16,942 --> 00:11:18,580
Oh, all right.

166
00:11:20,279 --> 00:11:21,724
Susie:
Oh. (Chuckles)

167
00:11:24,116 --> 00:11:25,288
(sighs)

168
00:11:27,753 --> 00:11:29,926
Man on radio: There has,
and continues to be criticism

169
00:11:29,989 --> 00:11:33,266
of the government's approach
to rebuilding Britain's economy.

170
00:11:33,325 --> 00:11:35,134
And we're better placed
to withstand

171
00:11:35,194 --> 00:11:37,765
an ideological drive
to shrink the state,

172
00:11:37,830 --> 00:11:41,141
with some of the most vulnerable people
in society paying the price.

173
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,278
Woman on radio: A charge that
the ministers would of course, reject?

174
00:11:43,302 --> 00:11:46,010
Man on radio: Yeah, sure,
they'd insist the tough measures

175
00:11:46,072 --> 00:11:49,144
they're taking will ensure Britain's
finances get back onto an even keel.

176
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:52,087
And we're better placed to
withstand any economic shocks

177
00:11:52,144 --> 00:11:53,488
that may come our way
in the future.

178
00:11:53,512 --> 00:11:56,755
Woman on radio:
Economic shocks such as, for instance...

179
00:11:56,816 --> 00:11:59,490
(frying pan sizzling)

180
00:11:59,552 --> 00:12:01,031
(hissing)

181
00:12:02,121 --> 00:12:03,828
Whoops.
(laughs)

182
00:12:09,161 --> 00:12:10,936
- Susie: Here.
- What's this?

183
00:12:10,996 --> 00:12:13,408
Time to join the 21 st century.

184
00:12:13,466 --> 00:12:16,470
Not least because I'm about to burst
and Mum's an invalid.

185
00:12:16,535 --> 00:12:19,311
- You're my only hope.
- (laughs)

186
00:12:19,371 --> 00:12:21,282
- Bye, Dad.
- Bye.

187
00:12:26,112 --> 00:12:27,489
(engine starts)

188
00:12:31,517 --> 00:12:34,396
(indistinct chatter on radio)

189
00:12:44,263 --> 00:12:46,265
(music playing)

190
00:12:53,739 --> 00:12:56,515
(knuckles cracking)

191
00:12:56,575 --> 00:12:58,646
(printer whirring)

192
00:13:03,349 --> 00:13:04,657
(computer chimes)

193
00:13:07,386 --> 00:13:09,696
(printer scanning)

194
00:13:27,473 --> 00:13:29,475
(clock dings, ticking)

195
00:13:45,524 --> 00:13:49,233
(man whistling)

196
00:13:49,295 --> 00:13:51,832
(rattling)

197
00:13:56,802 --> 00:13:58,145
Oh, good morning.

198
00:13:58,204 --> 00:14:00,047
Just about.

199
00:14:00,105 --> 00:14:03,746
Um... right.
Let me get that...

200
00:14:03,809 --> 00:14:06,551
- 82...
- (device beeping)

201
00:14:07,179 --> 00:14:09,181
Uh, and then you need to...

202
00:14:09,248 --> 00:14:12,354
No. Oh, sorry. There.

203
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:16,522
- Right.
- Thanks.

204
00:14:17,489 --> 00:14:19,628
All right.
Have a nice...

205
00:14:37,276 --> 00:14:41,418
Woman: "Dear, Tony, I think it right
that you should have the attached.

206
00:14:42,514 --> 00:14:46,189
Adrian always
spoke warmly of you,

207
00:14:46,252 --> 00:14:49,825
and perhaps you'll find it
an interesting, if painful,

208
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:52,836
memento of long ago.

209
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:56,933
I am also leaving you
some money.

210
00:14:56,996 --> 00:14:58,703
You may find this a bit strange,

211
00:14:58,764 --> 00:15:01,404
and, to tell you the truth,
I'm not entirely sure

212
00:15:01,467 --> 00:15:03,071
what my own motives are,

213
00:15:03,135 --> 00:15:07,083
but I wish you well,
even from beyond the grave.

214
00:15:07,139 --> 00:15:09,380
Yours, Sarah Ford.

215
00:15:09,441 --> 00:15:11,512
P.S., it may sound a little odd,

216
00:15:11,577 --> 00:15:14,524
but I think the last months
of his life were happy.“

217
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:16,059
Woman:
Mr. Webster?

218
00:15:16,115 --> 00:15:20,586
"Dear, Tony, I think it right
you should have the attached.

219
00:15:20,653 --> 00:15:22,462
Adrian always
spoke warmly of you,

220
00:15:22,521 --> 00:15:24,721
and perhaps you will find it
an interesting, if painful,

221
00:15:24,757 --> 00:15:27,533
- memento of long ago."
- We do not currently...

222
00:15:27,593 --> 00:15:31,439
So it is this attached item referred to,
which is the missing item.

223
00:15:31,497 --> 00:15:34,876
We do not currently have
the second item in our possession.

224
00:15:35,634 --> 00:15:37,272
Excuse me?

225
00:15:37,336 --> 00:15:39,976
I said, we do not currently have
the second item in our possession.

226
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:42,641
Well, where on earth is it?

227
00:15:42,708 --> 00:15:45,018
The item is currently
with Mrs. Ford's executor.

228
00:15:45,077 --> 00:15:46,181
Mrs. Ford's daughter.

229
00:15:46,245 --> 00:15:49,055
- Veronica?
- Mm.

230
00:15:49,114 --> 00:15:51,685
- You've asked for it, I assume?
- That's correct.

231
00:15:52,985 --> 00:15:55,192
Has she given any reason
for withholding it?

232
00:15:55,254 --> 00:15:56,699
I'm afraid I don't know.

233
00:15:56,755 --> 00:15:59,395
Forgive me,
but what do you know?

234
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:01,438
What is it?
Have you actually seen it?

235
00:16:01,493 --> 00:16:04,633
No, I haven't. Um...

236
00:16:04,697 --> 00:16:06,734
I can look it up for you,
if you wish.

237
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:08,710
Please do.

238
00:16:10,135 --> 00:16:12,137
(keyboard clacking)

239
00:16:13,205 --> 00:16:17,085
So, Mrs. Ford's will
describes the second item...

240
00:16:19,345 --> 00:16:21,518
- as a diary.
- A diary?

241
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:23,389
Belonging to Mrs. Ford?

242
00:16:23,449 --> 00:16:24,860
I'm afraid that's not clear.

243
00:16:26,852 --> 00:16:29,924
Can you let me have
Veronica's address, please?

244
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:33,698
I'm sorry, we can't give out clients'
addresses without their permission.

245
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:35,238
Veronica and I know one another.

246
00:16:35,294 --> 00:16:38,070
Well, did know one another,
albeit rather a long time ago.

247
00:16:38,130 --> 00:16:41,339
I'm afraid I would need
her authority to do that.

248
00:16:42,301 --> 00:16:45,908
Well, will you kindly request
that authority, please?

249
00:16:45,971 --> 00:16:47,075
Very well.

250
00:16:47,139 --> 00:16:50,211
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

251
00:16:50,275 --> 00:16:52,881
It was a pleasure meeting you,
Mr. Webster.

252
00:16:52,945 --> 00:16:54,856
Good-bye.

253
00:16:54,913 --> 00:16:57,723
And you should know
that my ex-wife is a QC.

254
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:03,022
- (indistinct chattering)
- (music playing)

255
00:17:05,357 --> 00:17:07,064
Yeah, this all seems fine.

256
00:17:07,126 --> 00:17:10,403
So, she has it, the diary.
That much at least we do know.

257
00:17:10,462 --> 00:17:12,567
Sorry, who has it?

258
00:17:12,631 --> 00:17:14,872
You know, those things
are really bad for you.

259
00:17:14,933 --> 00:17:17,379
They just build up excess mucus.

260
00:17:17,436 --> 00:17:19,746
I'm sorry, Dr. Webster,

261
00:17:19,805 --> 00:17:22,083
didn't think we were here
to discuss my bread-stick intake.

262
00:17:22,107 --> 00:17:23,814
All right, sorry, sorry, sorry.

263
00:17:25,177 --> 00:17:26,850
Feel better once we've eaten.

264
00:17:28,113 --> 00:17:29,615
Once we've ordered. Ah.

265
00:17:29,681 --> 00:17:31,991
Thank God.

266
00:17:33,352 --> 00:17:36,959
- Sir, Madam?
- I'd like the Carbonara, please.

267
00:17:37,022 --> 00:17:40,265
Mm, <i>Penne Con Salsa

268
00:17:43,529 --> 00:17:44,530

269
00:17:54,239 --> 00:17:56,116
- What?
- Tell me, tell me.

Not enjoying the party?

278
00:18:51,663 --> 00:18:53,734
It's not really my cup of tea.

279
00:18:56,835 --> 00:18:58,610
I'm a manic depressive, you see.

292
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:16,521
I wonder how far it is.

293
00:20:19,785 --> 00:20:22,925
It's 245 feet.

294
00:20:24,089 --> 00:20:26,194
So not very far, then.

295
00:20:29,127 --> 00:20:31,835
Why is your watch
on the inside of your wrist?

296
00:20:32,831 --> 00:20:35,004
Is it? I don't know.

298
00:20:47,546 --> 00:20:49,184

Tony: You still haven't

313

I tend to find it inadvisable
to give out my name

314
00:22:02,487 --> 00:22:04,933
to strange men
I've only just met.

315
00:22:06,858 --> 00:22:08,838
Margaret: Sounds like
a fruitcake, this Sarah.

316
00:22:08,894 --> 00:22:10,703
Veronica.
Her name's Veronica.

317
00:22:12,197 --> 00:22:15,406
What? I thought you said
the diary belonged to Sarah?

318
00:22:15,467 --> 00:22:17,310
Apparently, yes, the diary, yes,

319
00:22:17,369 --> 00:22:19,178
left to me by Sarah Ford.

320
00:22:19,237 --> 00:22:21,808
- Who is?
- Veronica's mother.

321
00:22:22,908 --> 00:22:25,946
So, you... you slept with Veronica
or you slept with Sarah?

322
00:22:26,712 --> 00:22:29,818
Strictly speaking, neither.
Sadly.

323
00:22:31,183 --> 00:22:33,356
Veronica and I were together.

324
00:22:34,686 --> 00:22:36,097
Boyfriend and girlfriend.

325
00:22:36,154 --> 00:22:38,430
Exactly, yes.
Kind-kind of an item, yes.

326
00:22:39,658 --> 00:22:41,729
- But that...
- And that's how you know Sarah.

327
00:22:43,995 --> 00:22:46,134
- Yes.
- Right.

328
00:22:47,699 --> 00:22:48,973
So we're getting somewhere.

329
00:22:49,668 --> 00:22:51,705
(horn honking)

330
00:23:03,048 --> 00:23:04,891
Looks like he's planning to move in.

331
00:23:06,385 --> 00:23:07,625
You look nervous.

332
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:10,197
Tony, this is my father.

333
00:23:11,156 --> 00:23:12,863
- Tony.
- David.

334
00:23:14,126 --> 00:23:16,572
We've heard all about you, Tony.
Come on.

335
00:23:16,628 --> 00:23:18,471
Let's get you two lovebirds home.

336
00:23:28,807 --> 00:23:30,184
(horn honks)

337
00:23:41,987 --> 00:23:43,330
Ta-da!

338
00:23:43,388 --> 00:23:45,129
Oh, um...

339
00:23:45,190 --> 00:23:48,137
you can pee into the basin at night,
if you wish.

340
00:23:48,193 --> 00:23:50,070
(chuckles)

341
00:24:03,742 --> 00:24:05,744
(woman singing indistinctly)

342
00:24:15,787 --> 00:24:16,857
(man clears throat)

343
00:24:23,728 --> 00:24:25,036
Not bad, eh?

344
00:24:26,665 --> 00:24:28,008
Jack.

345
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:30,670
I'm the big brother.

346
00:24:30,735 --> 00:24:32,180
Tony.

347
00:24:32,237 --> 00:24:35,775
- We've heard all about you, Tony.
- Oh? (Laughs)

348
00:24:35,841 --> 00:24:38,515
How do you like your lamb, Tony?

349
00:24:38,577 --> 00:24:40,079
Sorry?

350
00:24:40,712 --> 00:24:43,283
- We're having lamb this evening.
- (both chuckle)

351
00:24:43,348 --> 00:24:45,794
Oh. I see.

352
00:24:46,384 --> 00:24:48,125
Excellent.

353
00:24:49,888 --> 00:24:54,394
I'm, uh, I'm partial to a bit
of rare meat myself.

354
00:25:01,466 --> 00:25:02,877
I'll let you get settled.

355
00:25:07,072 --> 00:25:08,244
(door closes)

356
00:25:16,548 --> 00:25:18,027
(chuckles)

357
00:25:28,627 --> 00:25:30,834
Here, Tony,
have some roast potatoes.

358
00:25:30,896 --> 00:25:32,136
Thank you.

359
00:25:33,865 --> 00:25:35,811
Thank you, Mrs. Ford,
it all looks lovely.

360
00:25:35,867 --> 00:25:38,108
Hear, hear.
Motion seconded.

361
00:25:38,169 --> 00:25:39,614
Jack:
And me, please, Mother.

362
00:25:41,106 --> 00:25:42,380
Thank you.

363
00:25:43,074 --> 00:25:45,520
- How many?
- One more, please.

364
00:25:46,978 --> 00:25:48,184
Sarah:
Pass it down.

365
00:25:49,781 --> 00:25:51,158
Do start.

366
00:25:59,858 --> 00:26:03,635
Uh, a friend of mine's
at Cambridge, as it happens.

367
00:26:03,695 --> 00:26:05,538
Uh, Adrian Finn?

368
00:26:06,831 --> 00:26:10,335
- Should I know him?
- Uh, he's studying philosophy.

369
00:26:11,536 --> 00:26:13,482
My deepest sympathies.

370
00:26:13,538 --> 00:26:14,846
(laughter)

371
00:26:14,906 --> 00:26:16,749
(kicks under table)

372
00:26:16,808 --> 00:26:20,381
Sarah: And what about you, Tony?
You haven't told us what your subject is.

373
00:26:21,179 --> 00:26:23,216
English literature.

374
00:26:23,281 --> 00:26:25,426
Sarah: And what do you hope to do
with an undergraduate degree

375
00:26:25,450 --> 00:26:26,861
in English literature?

376
00:26:28,453 --> 00:26:30,694
Well, um...

377
00:26:30,755 --> 00:26:32,325
I-I hope to write.

378
00:26:32,390 --> 00:26:34,233
- Write?
- Yes.

379
00:26:35,327 --> 00:26:37,864
Um, poems. Poetry.

380
00:26:39,097 --> 00:26:41,236
A Poet?

381
00:26:49,474 --> 00:26:52,284
And who's your favorite poet?

382
00:26:52,344 --> 00:26:53,982
Mum.

383
00:26:54,045 --> 00:26:56,821
- Dylan Thomas.
- David: Ah, yes, yes.

384
00:26:56,881 --> 00:26:59,054
The gloomy Welshman.

385
00:26:59,117 --> 00:27:01,620
Jack:
“And the winds did bloom,

386
00:27:01,686 --> 00:27:04,064
and the brides in the wooed field

387
00:27:04,122 --> 00:27:07,103
did sew the coming
summer frost."

388
00:27:07,158 --> 00:27:09,900
David:
Ah, bravo, Jack.

389
00:27:11,162 --> 00:27:13,199
See what I have to
put up with, Tony?

390
00:27:16,334 --> 00:27:18,814
I'm partial to
a little Larkin myself.

391
00:27:18,870 --> 00:27:20,611
Oh, yes.

392
00:27:20,672 --> 00:27:22,674
He's wonderful, also.

393
00:27:25,276 --> 00:27:29,122
"I work all day,
and get half drunk at night.

394
00:27:32,183 --> 00:27:36,154
Waking at four to soundless dark...

395
00:27:37,288 --> 00:27:39,063
I stare.

396
00:27:40,558 --> 00:27:44,597
In time,
the curtain-edges will go bright."

397
00:27:47,332 --> 00:27:48,606
(chuckles awkwardly)

398
00:28:02,947 --> 00:28:04,722
Jack: Hear, hear.

399
00:28:04,783 --> 00:28:06,626
(chuckles bashfully)

400
00:28:25,437 --> 00:28:27,576
So...
(sighs)

401
00:28:28,673 --> 00:28:30,550
Good night, then.

402
00:28:32,544 --> 00:28:34,717
(whispers) Wait, I didn't
say anything embarrassing

403
00:28:34,779 --> 00:28:36,087
at dinner, did I?

404
00:28:37,549 --> 00:28:39,290
(Whispers)
Why are you whispering?

405
00:28:39,350 --> 00:28:40,761
(whispers)
I don't know.

406
00:28:40,819 --> 00:28:42,196
(normal voice)
Sorry.

407
00:28:53,865 --> 00:28:57,312
(whispers) I hope you sleep
the sleep of the wicked.

408
00:29:08,246 --> 00:29:11,523
(groaning)

409
00:29:16,321 --> 00:29:18,096
It's important you
understand the scale

410
00:29:18,156 --> 00:29:20,500
of sexual frustration
of my younger self.

411
00:29:21,326 --> 00:29:24,307
For God's sake.
You poor thing.

412
00:29:31,870 --> 00:29:34,146
You sure there isn't
some un-doused fire

413
00:29:34,205 --> 00:29:35,912
in your breast, Mr. Webster?

414
00:29:35,974 --> 00:29:37,419
Quite sure.

415
00:29:38,576 --> 00:29:42,786
So if... let's presume,
still unmarried fruitcake

416
00:29:42,847 --> 00:29:45,259
walked into this restaurant now

417
00:29:45,316 --> 00:29:48,092
and sat in that table...

418
00:29:49,087 --> 00:29:51,693
how would the long-divorced
Mr. Anthony Webster react?

419
00:29:51,756 --> 00:29:54,999
I don't think I'd be
especially pleased to see her.

420
00:29:56,261 --> 00:29:59,731
So you wouldn't start rolling up
your sleeves and turning over your watch?

421
00:29:59,798 --> 00:30:02,369
God.
I wish I'd never told you that.

422
00:30:03,434 --> 00:30:05,812
Can we have another...
More coffee?

423
00:30:12,143 --> 00:30:14,714
Come on,
let's hear the rest of it.

424
00:30:16,247 --> 00:30:17,920
- Sarah: Morning.
- (metal clatters)

425
00:30:18,883 --> 00:30:22,956
- You looking for something?
- (chuckles) No, I was just looking.

426
00:30:25,523 --> 00:30:27,799
The others have gone for a walk.

427
00:30:27,859 --> 00:30:29,896
Veronica said
you'd prefer a lie-in,

428
00:30:29,961 --> 00:30:32,339
so we opted not to disturb you.

429
00:30:34,966 --> 00:30:36,343
You hungry?

430
00:30:37,769 --> 00:30:38,770
Uh, yes.

431
00:30:42,273 --> 00:30:43,775
Have a seat.
(chuckles)

432
00:30:49,647 --> 00:30:51,923
(Sarah humming)

433
00:31:11,069 --> 00:31:14,482
You won't let Veronica get away
with too much, will you?

434
00:31:16,674 --> 00:31:17,675
Sorry?

435
00:31:19,677 --> 00:31:21,418
Don't let her get away
with too much.

436
00:31:25,717 --> 00:31:28,425
Sorry, I'm not quite sure
I follow your meaning.

437
00:31:29,187 --> 00:31:31,064
Oh! Damn it!

438
00:31:32,423 --> 00:31:34,425
(hissing)

439
00:31:35,260 --> 00:31:37,001
Whoops.
(laughs)

440
00:31:38,563 --> 00:31:39,974
Sorry.

441
00:31:41,366 --> 00:31:44,779
I'm normally very good at eggs.
(chuckles)

442
00:31:45,770 --> 00:31:48,114
- Tony, let me give you a hand.
- Thank you.

443
00:31:48,172 --> 00:31:50,174
(David humming)

444
00:31:52,810 --> 00:31:54,983
Well, Jack.

445
00:31:57,048 --> 00:31:58,652
He'll do, I suppose.

446
00:31:58,716 --> 00:32:00,457
(all laughing)

447
00:32:01,786 --> 00:32:04,494
Thanks for staying
the weekend, Tony.

448
00:32:04,555 --> 00:32:06,865
Thank you, Mrs. Ford.

449
00:32:10,929 --> 00:32:11,930
(engine starts)

450
00:32:19,437 --> 00:32:22,884
(David humming)

451
00:32:29,514 --> 00:32:31,425
I like your mum.

452
00:32:31,482 --> 00:32:34,861
(David laughs)
Sounds like you've got a rival, Vron.

453
00:32:35,753 --> 00:32:37,993
Come to think of it,
sounds like you're not the only one.

454
00:32:39,557 --> 00:32:41,537
Excuse me, I'm still speaking.

455
00:32:41,592 --> 00:32:43,538
You don't say.

456
00:32:43,594 --> 00:32:45,369
Something is clearly going on.

457
00:32:45,430 --> 00:32:47,205
Someone you knew long ago

458
00:32:47,265 --> 00:32:50,144
has left you something or other.

459
00:32:50,201 --> 00:32:53,774
Exactly. Which has been
unduly withheld from me

460
00:32:53,838 --> 00:32:55,579
and to which
I am legally entitled.

461
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:59,452
Well, you could fight it,
or you can just let it go.

462
00:33:00,578 --> 00:33:03,184
Cash the check,
take me on a budget holiday.

463
00:33:03,982 --> 00:33:06,826
250 each,
get us to the Channel Islands.

464
00:33:06,884 --> 00:33:09,660
- Listen, the point I...
- Something is certainly going on.

465
00:33:11,356 --> 00:33:14,337
So just call me when you
really want to talk about it.

466
00:33:22,900 --> 00:33:25,938
Oh, and the foot's much better,
thanks for asking.

467
00:33:26,004 --> 00:33:28,610
How is it, the foot?

468
00:33:28,673 --> 00:33:31,586
(door opens, closes)

469
00:33:33,644 --> 00:33:35,646
(music playing)

470
00:33:46,357 --> 00:33:49,463
(alarm clock ringing)

471
00:34:01,139 --> 00:34:03,141
(car horn honks)

472
00:34:29,567 --> 00:34:31,979
Woman:
So, I passed on your letters,

473
00:34:32,036 --> 00:34:34,277
all 13 of them, to Miss Ford.

474
00:34:34,338 --> 00:34:37,342
- And?
- While Miss Ford is still not ready

475
00:34:37,408 --> 00:34:39,012
to part with the diary.

476
00:34:39,077 --> 00:34:41,387
I can tell you that the diary,
it seems,

477
00:34:41,446 --> 00:34:43,187
belonged to a Mr. Adrian Finn.

478
00:34:45,083 --> 00:34:46,391
I see.

479
00:34:46,451 --> 00:34:49,830
Now, I've raised your concern
in terms of if or when

480
00:34:49,887 --> 00:34:52,390
you might be able to receive
Mr. Finn's diary.

481
00:34:52,457 --> 00:34:53,834
Let me get this straight.

482
00:34:53,891 --> 00:34:57,134
She should have handed
the diary over to you.

483
00:34:57,195 --> 00:34:58,538
She hasn't.

484
00:34:58,596 --> 00:35:00,371
You've asked for it,

485
00:35:00,431 --> 00:35:02,536
but she's refusing to give it up.

486
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:05,012
Yes, that's-that's certainly
how things stand at present.

487
00:35:10,908 --> 00:35:14,219
In my experience,
Mr. Webster,

488
00:35:14,278 --> 00:35:17,725
people often like to take some time out
following a bereavement.

489
00:35:17,782 --> 00:35:19,762
Don't you think?

490
00:35:19,817 --> 00:35:22,297
That's as may be.

491
00:35:22,353 --> 00:35:24,856
But I want to be quite sure

492
00:35:24,922 --> 00:35:29,393
that you are clear that
that diary belongs to me.

493
00:35:32,430 --> 00:35:33,670
- (brakes squeal)
- (horn honks)

494
00:35:39,837 --> 00:35:41,077
(car lock beeps)

495
00:35:44,642 --> 00:35:46,417
Hello.

496
00:35:46,477 --> 00:35:49,321
Andrew, this is Tony,
my ex-husband.

497
00:35:49,380 --> 00:35:50,415
Ah.

498
00:35:50,481 --> 00:35:52,483
How are you doing, Tony?
All right?

499
00:35:52,550 --> 00:35:55,258
- Hi.
- We work together.

500
00:35:55,319 --> 00:35:57,731
Can we talk?
It's important.

501
00:35:59,357 --> 00:36:02,167
Well, I'll leave you to it, then.

502
00:36:02,226 --> 00:36:03,899
Good to meet you, Tony.

503
00:36:03,961 --> 00:36:05,065
I'll see you Monday.

504
00:36:09,667 --> 00:36:12,978
This is not on, Tony, coming around
without being asked, sorry.

505
00:36:13,037 --> 00:36:16,211
You told me to call when I was ready
to tell you what was going on.

506
00:36:18,910 --> 00:36:20,514
(muffled)
You gonna let me in?

507
00:36:20,578 --> 00:36:22,580
Headmaster:
From summer to autumn.

508
00:36:22,647 --> 00:36:24,957
So, too, do we think ahead...

509
00:36:25,016 --> 00:36:26,723
(chuckles)
Rather him than us.

510
00:36:26,784 --> 00:36:29,458
To what we may achieve together.

511
00:36:30,955 --> 00:36:33,162
(boys laughing)

512
00:36:40,665 --> 00:36:41,837
(door opens)

513
00:36:43,668 --> 00:36:45,147
Good morning, gentlemen.

514
00:36:46,938 --> 00:36:48,338
I trust that you had good holidays,

515
00:36:48,372 --> 00:36:51,649
but time and tide tarry
for no man, so...

516
00:36:55,613 --> 00:36:57,786
Henry VIII.

517
00:36:59,016 --> 00:37:03,487
Which of you bright young
things can give me

518
00:37:03,554 --> 00:37:06,057
a characterization
of the age, hmm?

519
00:37:08,159 --> 00:37:09,160
Hmm?

520
00:37:11,696 --> 00:37:12,936
Simpson.

521
00:37:13,564 --> 00:37:15,202
Any thoughts?

522
00:37:15,266 --> 00:37:17,212
- There was unrest, sir.
- (students laugh)

523
00:37:17,268 --> 00:37:20,306
No, no, insightful, as always.

524
00:37:20,371 --> 00:37:23,875
But might you perhaps
care to elaborate?

525
00:37:25,476 --> 00:37:27,854
- There was great unrest, sir.
- (students laugh)

526
00:37:31,082 --> 00:37:32,561
Oh, dear.

527
00:37:32,617 --> 00:37:34,187
Anyone?

528
00:37:40,057 --> 00:37:41,058
Finn?

529
00:37:41,125 --> 00:37:44,129
Now, I'm conscious
it's your first day with us,

530
00:37:44,195 --> 00:37:48,234
but, um, any thoughts?

531
00:37:51,335 --> 00:37:53,713
- I don't know.
- What don't you know?

532
00:37:53,771 --> 00:37:55,682
Adrian: Well, I cannot know
what I don't know, sir,

533
00:37:55,706 --> 00:37:58,846
that's philosophically self-evident.

534
00:37:59,710 --> 00:38:03,783
What we do know is that
something happened, sir.

535
00:38:03,848 --> 00:38:05,020
Professor:
Come again?

536
00:38:05,082 --> 00:38:08,086
Well, something happened.

537
00:38:08,152 --> 00:38:12,692
All one can ever truly say of
any particular period of history, sir,

538
00:38:12,757 --> 00:38:14,395
is that something happened.

539
00:38:17,094 --> 00:38:19,233
Tony:
Hey, um, great line to Hunt, earlier.

540
00:38:19,297 --> 00:38:20,674
About something happened?

541
00:38:20,731 --> 00:38:22,369
Adrian: Oh, yes.

542
00:38:22,433 --> 00:38:24,106
I was disappointed
he didn't take that up.

543
00:38:24,168 --> 00:38:26,876
Well, I thought you made
an extremely valid point.

544
00:38:26,937 --> 00:38:28,848
I'm, uh, Tony Webster.

545
00:38:28,906 --> 00:38:30,214
I'm Adrian Finn.

546
00:38:37,982 --> 00:38:39,461
It's cheery.

547
00:38:39,517 --> 00:38:41,428
Are you familiar
with Dylan Thomas?

548
00:38:41,485 --> 00:38:43,089
Hmm, yes.

549
00:38:43,888 --> 00:38:47,131
I find him to be one of the most
humane poets of the 20th century.

550
00:38:47,191 --> 00:38:49,002
Boy: But then he did say it,
it was ridiculous.

551
00:38:49,026 --> 00:38:52,838
(groans)
Parents, what a load of effing bastards.

552
00:38:52,897 --> 00:38:56,367
Adrian Finn, Colin Simpson.
Colin Simpson, Adrian Finn.

553
00:38:56,434 --> 00:38:59,381
- Hello, Adrian Finn.
- And, uh, this is Alex Stuart.

554
00:38:59,437 --> 00:39:02,714
Oh, really great line to Hunt,
really great.

555
00:39:02,773 --> 00:39:04,051
Is there an issue
with your parents?

556
00:39:04,075 --> 00:39:06,112
Ugh, "issue" is putting it mildly.

557
00:39:06,177 --> 00:39:07,454
Just when you think
you can trust them...

558
00:39:07,478 --> 00:39:10,391
- Effing bastards.
- Just when you think you can trust them,

559
00:39:10,448 --> 00:39:12,257
- they go and behave like...
- Henry VIII?

560
00:39:12,316 --> 00:39:15,593
Like Henry the fucking VIII, exactly.

561
00:39:15,653 --> 00:39:17,599
Why are all your watches
turned inside?

562
00:39:17,655 --> 00:39:19,896
- Ah, because...
- That is a very good question.

563
00:39:19,957 --> 00:39:22,403
- We're taking a stand against...
- Hierarchically imposed...

564
00:39:22,460 --> 00:39:24,838
- intrinsically flawed...
- notions of time.

565
00:39:24,895 --> 00:39:26,636
It also looks quite cool.

566
00:39:28,299 --> 00:39:31,143
Colin:
So, Dylan Thomas, interesting.

567
00:39:31,202 --> 00:39:32,272
Yes.

568
00:39:33,471 --> 00:39:35,542
- Any good?
- Do you know him?

569
00:39:35,606 --> 00:39:37,950
- Not really.
- Alex". Not personally.

570
00:39:38,008 --> 00:39:40,079
(all laughing)

571
00:39:45,149 --> 00:39:47,755
(whispers)
Really sick of staring at wood paneling.

572
00:39:48,486 --> 00:39:49,794
(both chuckle)

573
00:40:03,334 --> 00:40:04,870
(whispering)

574
00:40:09,006 --> 00:40:10,815
I'm sorry to report...

575
00:40:12,510 --> 00:40:14,581
that I have some rather sad news

576
00:40:14,645 --> 00:40:17,023
which I wish to share
with you all this morning.

577
00:40:18,282 --> 00:40:21,229
Joseph Dobson,
of the Science Sixth...

578
00:40:22,319 --> 00:40:24,299
has been found dead.

579
00:40:26,524 --> 00:40:29,869
He was a gifted pupil
with a natural aptitude

580
00:40:29,927 --> 00:40:33,875
for both science
and modern languages.

581
00:40:33,931 --> 00:40:37,936
He was sadly cut down
in the flower of his youth...

582
00:40:38,002 --> 00:40:40,881
"Flower"?
Dobson is more vegetable material.

583
00:40:40,938 --> 00:40:43,544
- (stifled laugh)
- Alex: Was.

584
00:40:43,607 --> 00:40:44,950
Must have killed himself.

585
00:40:45,009 --> 00:40:47,285
Headmaster:
His brother, sister...

586
00:40:47,344 --> 00:40:48,414
- What?
- Colin: Shit.

587
00:40:48,479 --> 00:40:53,360
Finn, you're unusually quiet
this afternoon.

588
00:40:53,417 --> 00:40:56,796
I'm not sure I can add
anything to the debate, sir.

589
00:40:58,556 --> 00:41:01,230
Will wonders never cease?

590
00:41:01,292 --> 00:41:03,101
I don't find
the historian's need

591
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:04,833
to ascribe responsibility

592
00:41:04,895 --> 00:41:07,068
a particularly fruitful arena, sir.

593
00:41:08,365 --> 00:41:10,072
Care to elaborate?

594
00:41:11,635 --> 00:41:13,581
Historians yearn for an answer
to the question

595
00:41:13,637 --> 00:41:15,583
of who's to blame for this event

596
00:41:15,639 --> 00:41:19,416
or for that atrocity, but...
I don't know, sir.

597
00:41:19,477 --> 00:41:23,482
Sometimes it seems to me
it is impossible to know.

598
00:41:23,547 --> 00:41:24,924
Go on.

599
00:41:24,982 --> 00:41:27,485
Well, Patrick Lagrange,
sir, said that,

600
00:41:27,551 --> 00:41:29,895
"History is the certainty
produced at the point

601
00:41:29,954 --> 00:41:31,865
when the imperfections of memory

602
00:41:31,922 --> 00:41:33,924
meet the inadequacies
of documentation."

603
00:41:33,991 --> 00:41:35,971
It's the lies of victors, sir.

604
00:41:37,394 --> 00:41:39,635
As long as you understand
that it is also

605
00:41:39,697 --> 00:41:41,574
the delusions of the defeated.

606
00:41:41,632 --> 00:41:44,112
Adrian:
Take Dobson's suicide, sir.

607
00:41:47,471 --> 00:41:48,882
Professor Hunt:
Okay.

608
00:41:48,939 --> 00:41:51,579
We are told Dobson
came to take his own life,

609
00:41:51,642 --> 00:41:54,088
perhaps when he understood
his girlfriend was pregnant.

610
00:41:54,144 --> 00:41:56,021
Finn...

611
00:41:56,080 --> 00:41:57,787
Dobson's death
is a private matter.

612
00:41:57,848 --> 00:42:01,853
No... it's also a historical matter.

613
00:42:03,754 --> 00:42:06,894
The point I'm trying to make, sir,
is that nothing can now be known

614
00:42:06,957 --> 00:42:09,335
in the absence
of Dobson's own testimony.

615
00:42:09,393 --> 00:42:11,236
We...

616
00:42:11,295 --> 00:42:13,332
we may never know the truth.

617
00:42:13,397 --> 00:42:14,899
And...

618
00:42:14,965 --> 00:42:18,606
no amount of intellectual posturing
can alter that.

619
00:42:19,837 --> 00:42:22,977
Do you see the problem, sir?

620
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:26,283
Finn, I see the problem,
thank you.

621
00:42:26,343 --> 00:42:30,758
Camus says that suicide is
the only true philosophical question.

622
00:42:32,249 --> 00:42:35,526
Apart from ethics,
politics, aesthetics,

623
00:42:35,586 --> 00:42:37,190
and all that other stuff.

624
00:42:37,254 --> 00:42:39,294
All that other stuff
we're learning about in school.

625
00:42:39,323 --> 00:42:41,034
- About the beauty and wisdom...
- The only true one.

626
00:42:41,058 --> 00:42:43,629
The essential one on which
all the others depend.

627
00:42:45,296 --> 00:42:48,140
When we left school
and went our separate ways,

628
00:42:48,198 --> 00:42:50,041
out of everyone,
Adrian was the only one

629
00:42:50,100 --> 00:42:52,341
I desperately wanted
to stay in touch with.

630
00:42:58,309 --> 00:43:00,220
Lovely. Thank you.

631
00:43:11,922 --> 00:43:13,924
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

632
00:43:17,828 --> 00:43:19,205
Both:
Mm!

633
00:43:19,263 --> 00:43:21,038
That is good.

634
00:43:21,098 --> 00:43:23,374
I dare say it's almost
as good as sex.

635
00:43:23,434 --> 00:43:25,641
(scoffs)
Couldn't possibly comment.

636
00:43:25,703 --> 00:43:29,082
Maybe I need to improve
my taste in wine.

637
00:43:29,139 --> 00:43:31,176
Or your taste in sex.

638
00:43:35,145 --> 00:43:37,523
Speaking of which,
are we going to address the fact

639
00:43:37,581 --> 00:43:41,859
that almost everything
you've told me in the last few days,

640
00:43:41,919 --> 00:43:44,991
you've told me
for the very first time?

641
00:43:45,055 --> 00:43:47,934
I've never told you about all this stuff
because it wasn't important.

642
00:43:47,992 --> 00:43:50,905
In all the years that
we were together, Mr. Webster,

643
00:43:50,961 --> 00:43:53,771
it has never occurred to you
that it might be important to tell me

644
00:43:53,831 --> 00:43:55,936
about your former love?

645
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,879
Your first love, no doubt.

646
00:43:58,936 --> 00:44:00,745
I'm not talking
about Adrian Finn.

647
00:44:00,804 --> 00:44:02,579
I see.

648
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:04,677
Well, Mrs. Webster,

649
00:44:04,742 --> 00:44:07,416
I think you're very much
barking up the wrong tree.

650
00:44:07,478 --> 00:44:11,085
Indeed, on the wrong
patch of land altogether.

651
00:44:11,148 --> 00:44:13,924
Veronica and I were never in love,
I can assure you.

652
00:44:15,486 --> 00:44:18,626
She gave you your first camera,
didn't she?

653
00:44:28,232 --> 00:44:30,234
(music playing)

654
00:45:20,718 --> 00:45:23,358
Mm, Tony, it doesn't feel right.

655
00:45:23,420 --> 00:45:25,195
(Tony exhales)

656
00:46:23,981 --> 00:46:25,255
(knuckles cracking)

657
00:47:27,044 --> 00:47:29,581
Do you ever think about where
our relationship is heading?

658
00:47:34,885 --> 00:47:38,628
Is this a thinly-veiled attempt
to bring up our sex life?

659
00:47:40,557 --> 00:47:41,797
No.

660
00:47:43,460 --> 00:47:45,167
I'm positively laid-back

661
00:47:45,229 --> 00:47:47,641
about the fact that
we haven't had sex yet.

662
00:47:56,473 --> 00:47:58,384
Does it have to?

663
00:48:00,344 --> 00:48:02,483
Does it have to what?

664
00:48:04,248 --> 00:48:06,626
Head somewhere?
Our relationship.

665
00:48:16,927 --> 00:48:18,668
At the time I thought,
at least nobody died.

666
00:48:18,729 --> 00:48:20,106
Nobody got pregnant.

667
00:48:21,164 --> 00:48:23,610
You sound positively crestfallen.

668
00:48:23,667 --> 00:48:25,408
Mm.

669
00:48:26,603 --> 00:48:30,141
Oh, please, no.
I'll be all over the place.

670
00:48:30,207 --> 00:48:32,244
- Stop.
- (chuckles)

671
00:48:34,211 --> 00:48:36,191
But how did your friend's diary

672
00:48:36,246 --> 00:48:38,658
end up with fruitcake's mother?

673
00:48:39,616 --> 00:48:42,825
I think Adrian's stuff
ended up with Veronica.

674
00:48:42,886 --> 00:48:45,833
And that's how the diary
found its way to Sarah Ford.

675
00:48:45,889 --> 00:48:49,200
Yeah, but how did Adrian's stuff
end up with fruitcake?

676
00:48:49,259 --> 00:48:51,705
Veronica.
I was just coming to that.

677
00:48:51,762 --> 00:48:53,799
(indistinct chatter on TV)

678
00:48:55,899 --> 00:48:57,071
(knocks on door)

679
00:49:09,913 --> 00:49:13,690
Adrian: Dear, Tony, I wanted to
write to you as in recent months,

680
00:49:13,750 --> 00:49:16,788
Veronica and I have
grown very close.

681
00:49:16,853 --> 00:49:20,767
Indeed, we have now embarked
upon a relationship together.

682
00:49:20,824 --> 00:49:22,504
This would no doubt
come to your attention,

683
00:49:22,559 --> 00:49:25,904
and we thought it best
you heard it from us.

684
00:49:25,963 --> 00:49:28,739
Your friendship is deeply
important to us, Tony.

685
00:49:39,042 --> 00:49:40,453
(laughing)

686
00:50:23,253 --> 00:50:24,755
(chuckling)

687
00:51:23,880 --> 00:51:26,554
(music playing)

688
00:51:36,259 --> 00:51:38,102
When did you last see him, then?

689
00:51:41,298 --> 00:51:43,869
About three months ago.

690
00:51:43,934 --> 00:51:46,710
Right where you're sitting.
That's why I suggested it.

691
00:51:48,605 --> 00:51:50,846
He was going down
to Chislehurst.

692
00:51:53,210 --> 00:51:56,020
- How did he seem?
- Cheerful.

693
00:51:57,180 --> 00:51:59,126
Happy, like himself.

694
00:51:59,683 --> 00:52:01,185
Only more so.

695
00:52:04,955 --> 00:52:07,868
As we said good-bye,
he told me he was in love.

696
00:52:12,929 --> 00:52:14,966
(breathes deeply)

697
00:52:20,904 --> 00:52:24,147
- How did he do it?
- Wrists in the bath.

698
00:52:24,207 --> 00:52:25,515
Jesus Christ.

699
00:52:25,575 --> 00:52:27,680
Alex:
He knew how to do it.

700
00:52:27,744 --> 00:52:29,314
Diagonally.

701
00:52:29,379 --> 00:52:32,258
If you, uh, cut straight across,

702
00:52:32,315 --> 00:52:35,524
you lose consciousness
and the wound heals up.

703
00:52:35,585 --> 00:52:36,825
You botched it.

704
00:52:36,887 --> 00:52:39,128
Well, perhaps
you drown yourself.

705
00:52:39,189 --> 00:52:41,032
No, still second place.

706
00:52:41,925 --> 00:52:43,563
Adrian would have wanted first.

707
00:52:46,997 --> 00:52:48,840
Sort of Greek, isn't it?

708
00:52:49,866 --> 00:52:52,039
Both:
No, it's, um, hemlock.

709
00:52:52,102 --> 00:52:53,103
(laughs)

710
00:52:53,170 --> 00:52:55,480
More the exemplary Roman, I'd say.

711
00:52:55,539 --> 00:52:57,576
Opening the vein.

712
00:53:00,944 --> 00:53:03,515
- It's effing impressive.
- Yeah.

713
00:53:04,247 --> 00:53:06,090
Or a miserable waste.

714
00:53:07,918 --> 00:53:10,118
Margaret: So what do you think
you'll find in the diary?

715
00:53:11,054 --> 00:53:13,762
I've no idea. It's just mine.

716
00:53:13,823 --> 00:53:16,099
(chuckles)

717
00:53:16,159 --> 00:53:18,696
I think it's quite touching
that you're so stubborn.

718
00:53:20,096 --> 00:53:23,009
Probably a way of
not losing the plot at your age.

719
00:53:23,066 --> 00:53:25,273
I don't think I'd reacted
any differently

720
00:53:25,335 --> 00:53:26,746
when we were younger.

721
00:53:30,674 --> 00:53:33,814
Do you remember
that AU pair we had?

722
00:53:33,877 --> 00:53:35,652
The...

723
00:53:35,712 --> 00:53:37,817
- Swedish one?
- Mm.

724
00:53:38,848 --> 00:53:40,953
I found her diary once.

725
00:53:41,718 --> 00:53:43,026
And I...

726
00:53:43,086 --> 00:53:45,032
I was tidying up, and I read it.

727
00:53:45,956 --> 00:53:48,163
Do you know what I found?

728
00:53:48,225 --> 00:53:50,933
She'd written,
"I'm working for a real cow."

729
00:53:50,994 --> 00:53:52,996
(chuckling)

730
00:53:53,063 --> 00:53:56,203
"Husband's all right,
just keeps looking at my arse."

731
00:53:59,469 --> 00:54:02,211
Uh, you should have said,
we'd have got rid of her.

732
00:54:04,474 --> 00:54:05,782
(sighs)

733
00:54:07,744 --> 00:54:10,247
That's not the point of my story.

734
00:54:13,183 --> 00:54:14,253
(sighs)

735
00:54:14,317 --> 00:54:15,990
- It's getting late.
- Is it?

736
00:54:16,052 --> 00:54:19,226
Surely you're not insisting
your inebriated ex

737
00:54:19,289 --> 00:54:21,166
risks his life on the open road?

738
00:54:21,224 --> 00:54:22,760
Collateral damage.

739
00:54:22,826 --> 00:54:24,772
Think about my fellow drivers, then.

740
00:54:24,828 --> 00:54:28,298
- You're not staying.
- (sighs)

741
00:54:44,981 --> 00:54:46,221
(sighs)

742
00:54:47,584 --> 00:54:48,585
Good night, then.

743
00:54:48,652 --> 00:54:50,222
Wait, wait, wait.
I've got a question.

744
00:54:50,287 --> 00:54:51,823
Got a question.

745
00:54:55,592 --> 00:54:58,038
- Why did you leave me?
- (sighs)

746
00:54:59,796 --> 00:55:01,036
Be honest.

747
00:55:01,965 --> 00:55:03,603
Tony...

748
00:55:03,667 --> 00:55:06,045
No, be honest.
No, tell me.

749
00:55:08,271 --> 00:55:10,080
Did you leave because of me?

750
00:55:14,010 --> 00:55:16,183
Are you angry about Veronica?

751
00:55:17,314 --> 00:55:20,784
I'm not anything about Veronica.

752
00:55:26,489 --> 00:55:28,969
- Wasn't that bad, was it?
- (both laughing)

753
00:55:31,027 --> 00:55:33,633
- Good night, Tony.
- Good night.

754
00:55:45,942 --> 00:55:47,944
(beeps, clicks)

755
00:56:04,994 --> 00:56:06,405
(computer chimes)

756
00:56:06,463 --> 00:56:09,171
(music playing)

757
00:56:26,483 --> 00:56:28,622
- Tony Webster.
- Colin Simpson.

758
00:56:28,685 --> 00:56:30,565
- How the devil are you?
- Wonderful to see you.

759
00:56:30,620 --> 00:56:32,099
- Alex...
- Good to see you.

760
00:56:32,155 --> 00:56:33,327
Great to see you.

761
00:56:33,390 --> 00:56:35,165
You go and get in, sit in there.

762
00:56:35,225 --> 00:56:36,402
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

763
00:56:36,426 --> 00:56:37,871
Go on, go, go, go, go-

764
00:56:38,461 --> 00:56:40,168
(Tony chuckling)

765
00:56:41,698 --> 00:56:43,177
Colin:
Do you want a tea?

766
00:56:43,233 --> 00:56:45,975
Boys, you haven't changed.
I will have a tea.

767
00:56:46,035 --> 00:56:47,995
Colin: Excuse me, love,
could we have another tea?

768
00:56:51,674 --> 00:56:53,449
Blimey.

769
00:56:53,510 --> 00:56:55,046
What a nut job.

770
00:56:55,111 --> 00:56:56,886
What ever did you see in her?

771
00:56:56,946 --> 00:56:58,948
You and Adrian both.

772
00:56:59,015 --> 00:57:02,622
Well, you know,
she was very mysterious.

773
00:57:02,685 --> 00:57:03,755
(chuckles)

774
00:57:03,820 --> 00:57:05,800
You know, the great irony,
of course,

775
00:57:05,855 --> 00:57:08,199
was that it was you
that introduced them.

776
00:57:08,258 --> 00:57:09,464
Introduced who?

777
00:57:09,526 --> 00:57:11,301
Adrian and Veronica.

778
00:57:11,361 --> 00:57:14,865
No, Adrian met Veronica
through her brother Jack.

779
00:57:14,931 --> 00:57:17,912
Oh, wishful thinking,
my old friend.

780
00:57:17,967 --> 00:57:18,968
No.

781
00:57:19,035 --> 00:57:21,140
Yeah, Adrian and Jack
were at Cambridge together.

782
00:57:21,204 --> 00:57:22,342
But that's not how they met.

783
00:57:22,405 --> 00:57:25,045
No, it was your fault
that they got together.

784
00:57:25,108 --> 00:57:27,019
- Hole-in-one.
- No, no, no.

785
00:57:27,076 --> 00:57:28,453
You came up to town from Bristol

786
00:57:28,511 --> 00:57:30,616
with your ladylove
and you met all of us.

787
00:57:30,680 --> 00:57:34,184
Yeah, chomping at the bit
to introduce the love of your life.

788
00:57:35,652 --> 00:57:38,565
Oh, I could've sworn
they met through Jack.

789
00:57:38,621 --> 00:57:40,362
Afraid not.
(chuckles)

790
00:57:40,423 --> 00:57:43,370
I'm surprised you haven't had a good
rummage through the Webster albums.

791
00:57:43,426 --> 00:57:45,599
If memory serves,
you were always snapping away.

792
00:57:46,229 --> 00:57:50,803
Hmm. They must have been
deemed surplus to requirements.

793
00:58:09,219 --> 00:58:11,426
Colin:
Mm, that's a pity, old bean.

794
00:58:11,488 --> 00:58:14,526
Alex:
So have you... have you tried

795
00:58:14,591 --> 00:58:18,300
- contacting her directly?
- How?

796
00:58:19,395 --> 00:58:21,500
- She's not there. Try Jack.
- Okay.

797
00:58:21,564 --> 00:58:23,305
(keyboard clacking)

798
00:58:23,366 --> 00:58:24,504
Mm-hmm.

799
00:58:25,235 --> 00:58:26,270
Oh...

800
00:58:27,203 --> 00:58:28,580
Oh, right.

801
00:58:28,638 --> 00:58:29,946
Loads of them.

802
00:58:30,006 --> 00:58:31,007
(exhales)

803
00:58:31,074 --> 00:58:32,075
What about...

804
00:58:32,141 --> 00:58:34,052
- What that...
- This one?

805
00:58:34,110 --> 00:58:35,111
Oh, it's him.

806
00:58:35,178 --> 00:58:36,179
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

807
00:58:36,246 --> 00:58:37,247
Yeah, yeah.

808
00:58:37,313 --> 00:58:38,314
Wow.

809
00:58:38,381 --> 00:58:39,425
- God.
- Where on earth is he?

810
00:58:39,449 --> 00:58:40,860
Cricket.

811
00:58:40,917 --> 00:58:42,021
- Tennis, no?
- Tennis.

812
00:58:42,085 --> 00:58:43,496
- Oh, look.
- (laughs)

813
00:58:43,553 --> 00:58:44,554
All: Mm.

814
00:58:44,621 --> 00:58:46,123
- Who's that?
- I don't know.

815
00:58:46,189 --> 00:58:47,190
This is very nice.

816
00:58:47,257 --> 00:58:49,066
He looks as self-satisfied
as he ever did.

817
00:58:49,125 --> 00:58:50,433
(laughs)

818
00:58:51,661 --> 00:58:53,140
All: Oh...

819
00:58:53,196 --> 00:58:54,607
- Oh!
- (laughing)

820
00:58:56,266 --> 00:58:58,041
Do you want to
send him a message?

821
00:58:58,101 --> 00:59:01,571
- Isn't that a bit much?
- No, it'd be rude not to.

822
00:59:03,406 --> 00:59:05,852
Do people really
communicate this way?

823
00:59:05,909 --> 00:59:07,946
Yours truly
communicates this way.

824
00:59:08,011 --> 00:59:09,012
- Really?
- Yeah.

825
00:59:09,078 --> 00:59:11,649
L-I got in touch with a woman
I'd been at university with.

826
00:59:11,714 --> 00:59:13,591
Hadn't seen her for
the best part of 40 years.

827
00:59:13,650 --> 00:59:16,460
We met up,
got on like a house on fire.

828
00:59:16,519 --> 00:59:19,830
- Oh, great.
- You see, it's a boon for us widowers.

829
00:59:19,889 --> 00:59:21,334
- Mm.
- Hmm.

830
00:59:21,391 --> 00:59:22,392
There you go.

831
00:59:22,458 --> 00:59:23,869
- Sent.
- (computer chimes)

832
00:59:23,927 --> 00:59:25,873
Oh, done.

833
00:59:25,929 --> 00:59:27,909
- What?
- You're in now.

834
00:59:27,964 --> 00:59:31,309
Welcome to the 21 st century,
Mr. Webster.

835
00:59:31,367 --> 00:59:32,505
Oh, blimey.

836
00:59:32,569 --> 00:59:34,378
- Ta-Ra.
- (rain pattering)

837
00:59:37,206 --> 00:59:40,312
- Tell us how it all turns out.
- Certainly will.

838
00:59:40,376 --> 00:59:41,878
Don't let it get to you, old bean.

839
00:59:41,945 --> 00:59:43,549
Insightful as always.

840
00:59:47,417 --> 00:59:49,658
Alex:
Henry VIII.

841
00:59:49,719 --> 00:59:52,529
"Now, which one of you
young bright things can offer

842
00:59:52,589 --> 00:59:54,330
a characterization of the age?

843
00:59:54,390 --> 00:59:55,391
Simpson?"

844
00:59:55,458 --> 00:59:57,199
Colin:
I'd say there was unrest, sir.

845
00:59:57,260 --> 00:59:59,900
(stammers) I'd even say
there was great unrest, sir.

846
00:59:59,963 --> 01:00:02,000
(Colin and Alex laughing)

847
01:00:07,437 --> 01:00:09,508

(answering machine beeps)

861
01:01:23,212 --> 01:01:24,423
Tony on answering machine:
Hello, you have reached

862
01:01:24,447 --> 01:01:25,924
- telephone of Anthony Webster.
- Bollocks!

863
01:01:25,948 --> 01:01:27,518
I'm unable to take your call now.

864
01:01:27,583 --> 01:01:29,494
Please leave me a message
after the beep,

865
01:01:29,552 --> 01:01:32,089
and I will return your call
at my earliest convenience.

866
01:01:32,155 --> 01:01:33,361
- Thank you.
- (grunts)

867
01:01:33,423 --> 01:01:35,801
(answering machine beeps)

868
01:01:35,858 --> 01:01:37,132
Woman: Hello.

869
01:01:37,193 --> 01:01:40,697
This is Veronica Ford.

870
01:01:40,763 --> 01:01:44,336
I am in receipt of
all your correspondence,

871
01:01:44,400 --> 01:01:46,812
and I also understand
from my brother

872
01:01:46,869 --> 01:01:49,406
that you wish to meet
to discuss my mother's estate.

873
01:01:51,040 --> 01:01:52,951
I will be in town this morning.

874
01:01:54,644 --> 01:01:57,181
I will see you at
the wobbly bridge at 9:00 a.m.

- Shit.

are you sure?

01:03:22,098 --> 01:03:23,805
Really, Anthony.

894
01:03:26,135 --> 01:03:28,581
You said it didn't feel right
when we were going out.

895
01:03:28,638 --> 01:03:30,709
No, it didn't... then.

896
01:03:32,074 --> 01:03:33,849
But it does now?

897
01:03:38,347 --> 01:03:40,190
I don't know.

898
01:03:43,286 --> 01:03:45,323

Veronica?

903
01:04:13,916 --> 01:04:16,795
- Hello, Anthony.
- You look well.

904
01:04:16,853 --> 01:04:18,890
You're bald.

905
01:04:20,790 --> 01:04:22,770
Well, at least it proves
I'm not an alcoholic.

906
01:04:25,027 --> 01:04:26,904
Do people think
you're an alcoholic?

907
01:04:26,963 --> 01:04:29,034
No. No, they don't.

908
01:04:30,132 --> 01:04:32,237
I read somewhere that
if you're a very heavy drinker,

909
01:04:32,301 --> 01:04:35,578
there's something in the booze
that stops your hair from falling out.

910
01:04:39,775 --> 01:04:41,652
Shall we find
somewhere to sit down?

911
01:04:42,845 --> 01:04:43,949
Where?

912
01:04:44,013 --> 01:04:46,687
Anywhere?
I'm easy, as you may recall.

913
01:04:53,623 --> 01:04:54,897
Ready to order?

914
01:04:54,957 --> 01:04:57,267
- Um...
- I'll have a fresh mint tea, please.

915
01:04:57,326 --> 01:05:00,034
Um, what sort of coffee
do you serve?

916
01:05:00,096 --> 01:05:01,598
We serve our own blend.

917
01:05:01,664 --> 01:05:03,302
Roasted in our Roastery
in Heme Hill.

918
01:05:03,366 --> 01:05:04,572
Oh, blimey. Uh...

919
01:05:04,634 --> 01:05:06,409
- We don't mess around.
- (chuckles)

920
01:05:06,469 --> 01:05:08,380
Uh, in that case,
I'll have a <i>Macchiato</i>, please.

921
01:05:08,437 --> 01:05:11,008
- Single or double?
- Single, thank you.

922
01:05:11,073 --> 01:05:12,450
Thank you.

923
01:05:15,378 --> 01:05:17,119
Their own blend.

924
01:05:17,179 --> 01:05:19,125
Impressive stuff.
(chuckles)

925
01:05:20,383 --> 01:05:22,385
- (boy exclaiming)
- Woman: Oh!

926
01:05:23,452 --> 01:05:24,863
(wood clacking)

927
01:05:24,921 --> 01:05:27,458
I was sorry to hear about
your mother, Veronica.

928
01:05:28,758 --> 01:05:30,294
Yes.

929
01:05:30,960 --> 01:05:33,964
As, uh, as you're no doubt aware,

930
01:05:34,030 --> 01:05:37,876
it appears that your mother
left something to me in her will.

931
01:05:39,001 --> 01:05:41,174
And when I spoke

932
01:05:41,237 --> 01:05:42,978
with your mother's solicitor...

933
01:05:44,507 --> 01:05:48,353
I was told that the item
that has been left to me was...

934
01:05:48,411 --> 01:05:50,948
um, a diary written by Adrian.

935
01:05:54,951 --> 01:05:58,023
- I don't have the diary.
- Excuse me?

936
01:05:58,087 --> 01:05:59,828
I burnt it.

937
01:06:00,723 --> 01:06:02,600
But it belongs to me.

938
01:06:02,658 --> 01:06:04,236
- It doesn't belong to anyone.
- Boy: Vroom, vroom, vroom!

939
01:06:04,260 --> 01:06:06,103
Look!

940
01:06:06,162 --> 01:06:09,371
I think you'll find that the zoo
is north of the river.

941
01:06:11,334 --> 01:06:13,746
(sighs)
Unbelievable.

942
01:06:16,973 --> 01:06:20,284
Uh... I at least have,

943
01:06:20,343 --> 01:06:23,347
uh, the right to know
what is in it.

944
01:06:24,146 --> 01:06:26,285
Yes'.

945
01:06:27,416 --> 01:06:29,259
Morally, no.

946
01:06:29,318 --> 01:06:33,061
Have you any idea
how unsettling it was for me after,

947
01:06:33,122 --> 01:06:35,659
however many years it's been,

948
01:06:35,725 --> 01:06:38,399
to receive a letter from your mother?

949
01:06:39,328 --> 01:06:42,571
I can't be held accountable
for my mother's actions.

950
01:06:42,631 --> 01:06:44,804
Actually, as executor of her will,

951
01:06:44,867 --> 01:06:47,108
I rather suggest that you can.

952
01:07:12,461 --> 01:07:14,805
What's this?

953
01:07:14,864 --> 01:07:17,105
Because you seem to need
something to read.

954
01:07:19,135 --> 01:07:21,911
- Bye, Anthony.
- I'm-I'm sorry I raised my voice.

955
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:52,877
(indistinct chattering)

956
01:09:30,533 --> 01:09:32,035
(car lock beeps)

957
01:09:36,772 --> 01:09:38,183
(car door closes)

958
01:09:38,874 --> 01:09:40,581
(car engine starts)

959
01:09:45,948 --> 01:09:48,690
(cell phone chiming)

960
01:09:51,420 --> 01:09:52,899
Hi.

961
01:09:52,955 --> 01:09:54,798
(horn honking)

962
01:09:58,360 --> 01:09:59,634
(tires screech)

963
01:10:01,363 --> 01:10:03,775
- Sorry.
- That wasn't five minutes.

964
01:10:03,832 --> 01:10:05,209
No, I know, it's...

965
01:10:05,267 --> 01:10:06,712
Oh, quick. Right.

966
01:10:06,769 --> 01:10:09,750
Traffic was dreadful.
I'm really sorry.

967
01:10:10,372 --> 01:10:11,646
So this is it, is it?

968
01:10:11,707 --> 01:10:14,187
No, it's a spectacularly
elaborate wind-up, Dad.

969
01:10:14,243 --> 01:10:16,245
Yeah, sorry.
Sorry, point taken.

970
01:10:16,312 --> 01:10:17,655
Have you heard from Mum?

971
01:10:17,713 --> 01:10:19,317
Uh, no, no, but I phoned her

972
01:10:19,381 --> 01:10:21,141
and she's in a meeting,
but I left a message.

973
01:10:21,183 --> 01:10:22,685
- (grunts)
- Oh.

974
01:10:24,320 --> 01:10:25,560
Oh!

975
01:10:26,222 --> 01:10:27,792
Right. Okay.

976
01:10:27,856 --> 01:10:29,233
Off we go.

977
01:10:33,229 --> 01:10:34,230
(engine starts)

978
01:10:34,296 --> 01:10:37,300
- Dad, I think I'm gonna be sick.
- You're gonna be sick?

979
01:10:38,234 --> 01:10:39,269
(Susie groans)

980
01:10:39,335 --> 01:10:41,372
(crying)

981
01:10:41,437 --> 01:10:44,680
Oh, this whole thing's
such a load of shit.

982
01:10:44,740 --> 01:10:48,051
I mean, our gene pool alone
is bad enough.

983
01:10:48,110 --> 01:10:50,215
Workaholic meets curmudgeon

984
01:10:50,279 --> 01:10:52,023
- meets deranged 30-something.
- You're not a curmudgeon.

985
01:10:52,047 --> 01:10:54,584
- I was talking about you.
- I know, darling.

986
01:10:54,650 --> 01:10:56,493
The best thing you can do
is just relax,

987
01:10:56,552 --> 01:10:57,896
- calm down.
- Look, don't tell me to relax.

988
01:10:57,920 --> 01:11:00,799
Jesus. Just call Mum.

989
01:11:02,691 --> 01:11:03,965
Afternoon, I'm Emma.

990
01:11:04,026 --> 01:11:06,097
Hi, Emma. I'm Tony.
This is Susie.

991
01:11:06,161 --> 01:11:09,074
- How we doing?
- We're having a bit of a wobble.

992
01:11:09,131 --> 01:11:10,906
Oh, for Christ's sake, Dad.

993
01:11:10,966 --> 01:11:13,776
All right, I'll leave
you two to it, okay?

994
01:11:13,836 --> 01:11:16,612
- Where are you going?
- Isn't that what you want?

995
01:11:17,606 --> 01:11:20,052
Do you want me to stay?
Do you want me to go? Call Mum?

996
01:11:20,109 --> 01:11:21,281
Yes.

997
01:11:22,278 --> 01:11:24,258
Right, right.

998
01:11:25,481 --> 01:11:26,824
(door closes)

999
01:11:46,602 --> 01:11:48,377
(men laughing on TV)

1000
01:11:48,437 --> 01:11:50,212
Man on TV:
Good night, Harry.

1001
01:11:59,181 --> 01:12:01,593
(laughing on TV)

1002
01:12:01,650 --> 01:12:03,630
Man on TV: Flying Doctor
calling Wollumboola base.

1003
01:12:14,596 --> 01:12:16,439
Tony:
“Dear, Adrian and Veronica.

1004
01:12:18,901 --> 01:12:21,347
Hello, bitch,
and welcome to this letter.

1005
01:12:21,403 --> 01:12:22,711
(door opens)

1006
01:12:30,646 --> 01:12:33,058
A letter to you both
to wish you much joy.

1007
01:12:33,115 --> 01:12:35,435
- You certainly deserve one another.
- (typewriter dinging)

1008
01:12:37,886 --> 01:12:40,059
(sighs)

1009
01:12:42,124 --> 01:12:44,070
Indeed, I hope you get so involved

1010
01:12:44,126 --> 01:12:46,766
that the mutual damage
will be permanent.

1011
01:12:50,265 --> 01:12:52,245
Part of me hopes
you'll have a child

1012
01:12:52,301 --> 01:12:54,577
because I'm a great believer
in time's revenge.

1013
01:12:54,636 --> 01:12:57,276
Yay unto the next generation,
and all that.

1014
01:12:58,374 --> 01:12:59,614
But in fairness,

1015
01:12:59,675 --> 01:13:01,211
it would perhaps be
somewhat unjust

1016
01:13:01,276 --> 01:13:02,880
to inflict such ill will

1017
01:13:02,945 --> 01:13:05,118
on the fruit
of your poisonous Joins.

1018
01:13:11,820 --> 01:13:14,562
Adrian, if she hasn't
let you go all the way yet,

1019
01:13:14,623 --> 01:13:16,159
I suggest you break up with her.

1020
01:13:16,225 --> 01:13:18,436
And no doubt she'll be round
your place as quick as a flash

1021
01:13:18,460 --> 01:13:20,269
with sodden knickers
and a three-pack,

1022
01:13:20,329 --> 01:13:21,535
eager to give it away.

1023
01:13:21,597 --> 01:13:23,008
(Veronica moaning)

1024
01:13:28,370 --> 01:13:31,249
Certainly,
it worked for yours truly.

1025
01:13:32,541 --> 01:13:35,385
Veronica is undoubtedly
someone who will manipulate you.

1026
01:13:35,444 --> 01:13:38,186
Even her own mother
warned me against her.

1027
01:13:40,382 --> 01:13:43,295
In fact, if I were you,
I'd check things out with Mum.“

1028
01:13:46,855 --> 01:13:47,856
Margaret: Tony?

1029
01:13:49,792 --> 01:13:50,935
- Where is she?
- It's all right.

1030
01:13:50,959 --> 01:13:52,961
She's all right. She's fine.

1031
01:13:53,028 --> 01:13:54,837
She's through here.

1032
01:14:02,704 --> 01:14:04,706
(squeaking)

1033
01:14:15,751 --> 01:14:17,731
So what was the problem?

1034
01:14:19,955 --> 01:14:22,401
It's fine.
It's a false alarm.

1035
01:14:23,125 --> 01:14:24,763
I don't understand.

1036
01:14:26,295 --> 01:14:29,435
- No one's expecting you to.
- Give me some credit.

1037
01:14:34,536 --> 01:14:37,745
(Susie coughs)
Stop the car.

1038
01:14:38,474 --> 01:14:41,250
- Stop the car.
- All right.

1039
01:14:41,310 --> 01:14:42,482
- She's feeling sick.
- Okay.

1040
01:14:42,544 --> 01:14:43,852
Stop the car.

1041
01:14:44,713 --> 01:14:46,693
(tires screech)

1042
01:14:52,754 --> 01:14:54,791
(Susie vomiting)

1043
01:14:54,857 --> 01:14:56,928
Margaret:
Good girl. Good girl.

1044
01:14:58,293 --> 01:15:01,069
- Get it all out.
- (Susie coughing)

1045
01:15:03,232 --> 01:15:05,234
(Susie groaning)

1046
01:15:14,076 --> 01:15:16,579
- How is she?
- She's fine.

1047
01:15:22,618 --> 01:15:24,427
Do you need a lift home?

1048
01:15:24,486 --> 01:15:27,023
(sighs)
I think I'm gonna stay.

1049
01:15:28,557 --> 01:15:32,471
- Do you think I should stay, too?
- That's completely up to you.

1050
01:15:39,401 --> 01:15:41,472
I met Veronica.

1051
01:15:42,838 --> 01:15:44,875
Well, congratulations.

1052
01:15:47,109 --> 01:15:49,316
Would you believe it,
she's hardly changed.

1053
01:15:49,378 --> 01:15:52,552
Still has the same
extraordinary coldness.

1054
01:15:55,083 --> 01:15:56,653
- Here.
- What?

1055
01:15:56,718 --> 01:15:58,197
To mop up the drool.

1056
01:15:58,253 --> 01:15:59,527
Ah.

1057
01:16:02,591 --> 01:16:05,970
- I want to show you something.
- What?

1058
01:16:07,062 --> 01:16:08,632
- What's that?
- Open it.

1059
01:16:24,713 --> 01:16:26,590
This is horrible.

1060
01:16:32,654 --> 01:16:34,133
(sighs)

1061
01:16:34,923 --> 01:16:36,493
Did you write this?

1062
01:16:36,558 --> 01:16:38,094
She gave it to me,
and then she left.

1063
01:16:38,160 --> 01:16:40,834
- But I followed her.
- You did what?

1064
01:16:40,896 --> 01:16:42,898
I don't mean followed followed,

1065
01:16:42,965 --> 01:16:45,309
- but she set off before...
- This her car license number?

1066
01:16:46,768 --> 01:16:47,769
Yes, but, wait, listen.

1067
01:16:47,836 --> 01:16:49,113
All I wanted to do
was establish...

1068
01:16:49,137 --> 01:16:52,584
Following someone home and casually
jotting down their car license number

1069
01:16:52,641 --> 01:16:54,018
is tantamount to stalking.

1070
01:16:54,076 --> 01:16:56,920
- Oh, Margaret, come on.
- No, I'm perfectly serious.

1071
01:16:56,979 --> 01:16:58,822
Seems to me
you're a hair's breadth away

1072
01:16:58,880 --> 01:17:00,382
from a restraining order.

1073
01:17:00,449 --> 01:17:02,986
- I wanted to apologize.
- No, you didn't.

1074
01:17:03,051 --> 01:17:06,965
You wanted to hear her say how wonderful
you are and how you haven't changed.

1075
01:17:07,022 --> 01:17:08,831
And how she's thought of you
all these years,

1076
01:17:08,890 --> 01:17:11,734
and looked up at the stars
and wondered...

1077
01:17:13,395 --> 01:17:15,875
I'm sorry,
it's all a bit pathetic.

1078
01:17:15,931 --> 01:17:17,569
Don't hold back, will you?

1079
01:17:17,633 --> 01:17:19,977
Do you know what
really strikes me is...

1080
01:17:20,669 --> 01:17:24,173
your total inability to see
what's right under your nose.

1081
01:17:24,239 --> 01:17:25,240
Such as?

1082
01:17:26,708 --> 01:17:28,244
Such as your daughter,

1083
01:17:28,310 --> 01:17:30,916
who happens to be lying next door
going out of her mind.

1084
01:17:30,979 --> 01:17:33,721
(scoffs)
You said she was fine.

1085
01:17:36,351 --> 01:17:38,262
You're on your own now.

1086
01:17:39,821 --> 01:17:41,232

Man: Might rain later.

1108
01:19:25,260 --> 01:19:27,501
Veronica:
Mm, there's always a later.

1109
01:19:32,934 --> 01:19:35,346
(car engine starts)

1110
01:19:37,439 --> 01:19:39,180
(indistinct conversation)

1111
01:19:47,949 --> 01:19:49,360
(indistinct)

1112
01:20:01,830 --> 01:20:03,867
(men shouting)

1113
01:20:08,837 --> 01:20:10,714
Hey, hey, that's enough.

1114
01:20:11,640 --> 01:20:14,883
I said that's enough.
Friday's pub night.

1115
01:20:15,877 --> 01:20:18,915
- Man: Take me to the pub!
- Hey, Graham, I'm watching you.

1116
01:20:18,980 --> 01:20:20,050
All right.

1117
01:20:25,320 --> 01:20:27,391
Come on,
let's all make it across.

1118
01:20:27,455 --> 01:20:29,298
We'll make the pub in one piece.

1119
01:20:31,226 --> 01:20:34,298
Here we are, guys.
Do a little headcount.

1120
01:20:34,362 --> 01:20:36,706
(continues indistinctly)

1121
01:20:44,172 --> 01:20:46,345
Veronica: Are you all looking
forward to your beers?

1122
01:20:48,810 --> 01:20:51,051
Okay.
Well, I'm gonna be leaving you.

1123
01:20:51,112 --> 01:20:53,820
- Man: Are you going?
- And I'll see you next week.

1124
01:20:53,882 --> 01:20:54,952
- All right?
- Man: Bye.

1125
01:20:56,718 --> 01:20:58,026
- See you next week.
- See ya.

1126
01:20:58,086 --> 01:20:59,690
Bye-bye, Veronica.

1127
01:20:59,754 --> 01:21:00,755
Lovely to see you.

1128
01:21:00,822 --> 01:21:02,529
All: Bye-bye.

1129
01:21:03,558 --> 01:21:05,333
(continues indistinctly)

1130
01:21:10,799 --> 01:21:12,801
(siren wailing in distance)

1131
01:21:24,512 --> 01:21:27,618
- What are you doing?
- Oh, hi.

1132
01:21:27,682 --> 01:21:29,593
I saw you and, uh...
(chuckles)

1133
01:21:29,651 --> 01:21:32,894
- Saw me and what?
- I was... I was passing through,

1134
01:21:32,954 --> 01:21:35,166
and I saw you, and I thought,
well, now's the chance to...

1135
01:21:35,190 --> 01:21:39,366
- I don't want you following me.
- I wasn't following you.

1136
01:21:39,427 --> 01:21:41,930
You were running after me.

1137
01:21:41,997 --> 01:21:44,375
Jogging, maybe.
(chuckles)

1138
01:21:46,401 --> 01:21:49,939
- What'd you want?
- When I read that letter...

1139
01:21:50,005 --> 01:21:52,815
It wasn't intended
as a start to a conversation.

1140
01:21:52,874 --> 01:21:55,354
Nonetheless,
let me at least buy you a drink.

1141
01:21:55,410 --> 01:21:58,448
Let me buy you a drink, and you'll
never have to see me again, ever.

1142
01:22:02,217 --> 01:22:03,491
What is this?

1143
01:22:03,551 --> 01:22:05,930
- Those are my details, uh, email...
- No, I have your details.

1144
01:22:05,954 --> 01:22:09,959
- What is it that you do?
- I have a shop,

1145
01:22:10,025 --> 01:22:13,063
albeit a very, very,
very small shop, selling cameras.

1146
01:22:13,128 --> 01:22:15,540
Rare, second-hand cameras.
Leicas.

1147
01:22:17,766 --> 01:22:19,245
Make a living?

1148
01:22:19,301 --> 01:22:21,110
Yes, well, depends
what you call a living.

1149
01:22:21,169 --> 01:22:23,012
I'm retired, so...

1150
01:22:23,071 --> 01:22:25,745
So, coffee or drink?

1151
01:22:25,807 --> 01:22:28,413
Is this about "closing the circle"?

1152
01:22:29,277 --> 01:22:32,281
Don't know about that.
But it can't hurt, can it?

1153
01:22:35,750 --> 01:22:38,287
I'm not available at the moment to go
and have a drink with you.

1154
01:22:38,353 --> 01:22:39,423
Okay.

1155
01:22:41,723 --> 01:22:43,327
But perhaps at some point.

1156
01:22:44,225 --> 01:22:45,966
Great.

1157
01:22:46,027 --> 01:22:48,268
Fantastic.
Eh, whenever suits.

1158
01:22:48,330 --> 01:22:49,707
(keys jingling)

1159
01:23:03,745 --> 01:23:04,985
(sighs)

1160
01:23:41,182 --> 01:23:43,788
(indistinct chattering)

1161
01:23:43,852 --> 01:23:46,230
Woman:
Okay, who loves “The Simpsons“?

1162
01:23:46,287 --> 01:23:48,927
Me, me.

1163
01:23:48,990 --> 01:23:51,163
- "Downton's Abbey"?
- (woman speaking indistinctly)

1164
01:23:51,226 --> 01:23:53,934
I've never...
I don't watch "Downton's Abbey."

1165
01:23:53,995 --> 01:23:56,100
(chatter continues indistinct)

1166
01:23:59,467 --> 01:24:01,640
- I'm going to go to the toilet.
- Okay.

1167
01:24:15,917 --> 01:24:20,127
- She works on... she works...
- I don't know.

1168
01:24:32,967 --> 01:24:34,446
(men chattering)

1169
01:24:34,502 --> 01:24:35,810
No, she's not.

1170
01:24:35,870 --> 01:24:37,975
- What was her name again?
- I don't know.

1171
01:24:38,039 --> 01:24:39,541
- Yes, you do.
- No, I don't.

1172
01:24:39,607 --> 01:24:40,984
You do know her name.

1173
01:24:41,042 --> 01:24:42,680
(chuckles)
Like your badges.

1174
01:24:43,311 --> 01:24:44,312
Yeah.

1175
01:24:44,379 --> 01:24:46,518
Amazing array.
Can I have a look?

1176
01:24:49,484 --> 01:24:50,986
Ah, they're brilliant.

1177
01:24:51,853 --> 01:24:53,730
I'm a Stones fan myself.
(chuckles)

1178
01:24:53,788 --> 01:24:55,299
Do you wanna tell him
where you get them from?

1179
01:24:55,323 --> 01:24:56,927
Yeah, where do you get them?

1180
01:24:58,293 --> 01:25:00,170
Do you have a favorite
in particular?

1181
01:25:04,265 --> 01:25:05,642
- This one?
- Yeah?

1182
01:25:05,700 --> 01:25:06,804
- It is...
- I think.

1183
01:25:06,868 --> 01:25:08,879
- Yeah, it was very expensive, wasn't it?
- Brilliant.

1184
01:25:08,903 --> 01:25:11,315
You bought that one
the other day, didn't you, Adrian?

1185
01:25:18,012 --> 01:25:20,891
Nice meeting you, Adrian.

1186
01:25:20,949 --> 01:25:23,520
They're brilliant.
Really brilliant.

1187
01:25:24,986 --> 01:25:26,727
- Have a good day.
- And you.

1188
01:25:26,788 --> 01:25:27,892
Come on.

1189
01:25:30,425 --> 01:25:33,167
Take Dobson's suicide, sir.

1190
01:25:37,232 --> 01:25:39,769
We are told Dobson
came to take his own life,

1191
01:25:39,834 --> 01:25:42,246
perhaps when he understood
his girlfriend was pregnant.

1192
01:25:48,510 --> 01:25:50,490
Tony:
"Indeed, I hope you get so involved

1193
01:25:50,545 --> 01:25:53,583
that the mutual damage
will be permanent.

1194
01:25:53,648 --> 01:25:55,719
Part of me hopes
you'll have a child

1195
01:25:55,783 --> 01:25:58,696
because I'm a great believer
in time's revenge."

1196
01:26:04,826 --> 01:26:06,032
(typewriter dings)

1197
01:26:45,066 --> 01:26:47,068
(music playing)

1198
01:26:51,673 --> 01:26:54,119
What are you reading?

1199
01:26:54,175 --> 01:26:55,916
Zweig.

1200
01:26:56,511 --> 01:26:58,822
So you've worked your way
right through the alphabet, have you?

1201
01:26:58,846 --> 01:27:01,452
Can't be anyone left after him.

1202
01:27:01,516 --> 01:27:02,859
(chuckles)

1203
01:27:05,186 --> 01:27:08,190
Are you, uh, married, I take it?

1204
01:27:08,256 --> 01:27:10,793
- Not married.
- Never?

1205
01:27:13,261 --> 01:27:15,798
Mysterious to a fault.

1206
01:27:15,863 --> 01:27:18,434
I'm divorced, by the way.
In case you were wondering.

1207
01:27:18,499 --> 01:27:20,877
I wasn't, but...

1208
01:27:20,935 --> 01:27:23,211
- I'm sorry to hear that.
- On the contrary.

1209
01:27:23,271 --> 01:27:25,478
Very happily so.

1210
01:27:25,540 --> 01:27:27,144
Best decision we ever undertook.

1211
01:27:27,208 --> 01:27:28,915
In fact, she...

1212
01:27:28,977 --> 01:27:31,617
Margaret recently accused me

1213
01:27:31,679 --> 01:27:34,592
of having built
a shrine to you no less.

1214
01:27:36,584 --> 01:27:37,961
The shop.

1215
01:27:38,019 --> 01:27:41,296
When I told her that it was you
who gave me my first Leica.

1216
01:27:44,158 --> 01:27:46,001
And what did you say?

1217
01:27:51,499 --> 01:27:52,807
Ah!

1218
01:27:55,169 --> 01:27:56,443
Woman: Hi, Tony.

1219
01:27:58,072 --> 01:28:00,018
Those two are...

1220
01:28:00,074 --> 01:28:02,987
in my daughter's NCT group.

1221
01:28:04,078 --> 01:28:05,887
Lesbians, pregnant lesbians.

1222
01:28:05,947 --> 01:28:07,756
Good God.
(chuckles)

1223
01:28:07,815 --> 01:28:09,886
Whatever will they all
think of next?

1224
01:28:09,951 --> 01:28:11,294
(chuckles)

1225
01:28:13,121 --> 01:28:15,624
My daughter's 36, by the way.

1226
01:28:16,824 --> 01:28:18,384
Apart from coming off
the rails somewhat

1227
01:28:18,426 --> 01:28:22,101
and deciding to have a child
all on her very own,

1228
01:28:22,163 --> 01:28:24,575
she works in PR.

1229
01:28:24,632 --> 01:28:27,374
Whatever that may mean.
(laughs)

1230
01:28:31,105 --> 01:28:32,277
Thanks for the tea, Tony.

1231
01:28:32,340 --> 01:28:34,718
I... I have to leave,
I have an appointment.

1232
01:28:34,776 --> 01:28:38,223
- Are you... Did I say...
- No, finish your cake.

1233
01:28:38,279 --> 01:28:39,990
Is this because I've been
banging on about myself?

1234
01:28:40,014 --> 01:28:42,016
- 'Cause I don't mean to.
- No.

1235
01:28:43,418 --> 01:28:45,091
Uh, the other day...

1236
01:28:45,153 --> 01:28:46,996
after we met,
I went to that pub.

1237
01:28:47,555 --> 01:28:49,592
I met Adrian.

1238
01:28:51,693 --> 01:28:54,401
Both Adrian and you
are very important to me.

1239
01:28:54,462 --> 01:28:58,706
And all I can say is that
abhorrent letter of mine

1240
01:28:58,766 --> 01:29:01,645
was the expression of a moment.

1241
01:29:01,703 --> 01:29:04,980
And it was deeply shocking
for me to read after all these years.

1242
01:29:05,039 --> 01:29:07,519
- Do we really need to do this?
- If I may, though.

1243
01:29:07,575 --> 01:29:11,250
I'm not expecting you to hand over
Adrian's diary anymore.

1244
01:29:11,312 --> 01:29:13,383
If you've burnt it,
that's the end of it.

1245
01:29:13,448 --> 01:29:16,622
And if not, as it was written
by the father of your son,

1246
01:29:16,684 --> 01:29:18,163
it belongs to you.

1247
01:29:22,290 --> 01:29:24,463
- Enough.
- I-l can only imagine

1248
01:29:24,525 --> 01:29:26,004
how difficult it's been for you.

1249
01:29:26,060 --> 01:29:29,098
No, you cannot imagine.

1250
01:29:30,865 --> 01:29:33,368
No. Right. Yes.

1251
01:29:57,625 --> 01:29:59,298
Whoops.

1252
01:30:07,001 --> 01:30:09,038
(both laughing)

1253
01:30:15,410 --> 01:30:16,889
(sighs)

1254
01:30:28,122 --> 01:30:30,159
(indistinct chattering)

1255
01:30:33,294 --> 01:30:35,501
(music playing)

1256
01:30:39,000 --> 01:30:40,536
Man:
Is that everyone?

1257
01:30:40,601 --> 01:30:41,909
(door closes)

1258
01:30:44,272 --> 01:30:45,979
Adrian, are you okay?

1259
01:30:46,040 --> 01:30:47,917
Adrian, Jr.:
It's that man.

1260
01:30:51,579 --> 01:30:53,183
(indistinct conversation)

1261
01:30:59,020 --> 01:31:01,057
Yeah, that one I saw, yeah.

1262
01:31:01,122 --> 01:31:02,760
- Over there?
- Yes.

1263
01:31:03,357 --> 01:31:05,428
The one with the bad beard?

1264
01:31:07,762 --> 01:31:09,435
(whispering)

1265
01:31:14,769 --> 01:31:16,373
I'll be right back.

1266
01:31:27,415 --> 01:31:28,416
Hello.

1267
01:31:30,952 --> 01:31:32,932
Is there something
I can help you with?

1268
01:31:32,987 --> 01:31:36,127
- Do you want a chip?
- No, no, I'm fine.

1269
01:31:36,190 --> 01:31:38,932
On the menu it says
they're fat cut, hand cut.

1270
01:31:38,993 --> 01:31:40,637
But what it really means
is they're fat cut.

1271
01:31:40,661 --> 01:31:42,868
They've not actually
been cut by hand at all.

1272
01:31:44,465 --> 01:31:46,706
Uh, look, don't take this
the wrong way, but...

1273
01:31:46,767 --> 01:31:48,940
I'll do my best.
(chuckles)

1274
01:31:49,003 --> 01:31:50,880
I think, for whatever reason,

1275
01:31:50,938 --> 01:31:53,817
one of the people I look after
is a little uncomfortable

1276
01:31:53,875 --> 01:31:55,650
with you being here.

1277
01:31:55,710 --> 01:31:59,283
- Again.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

1278
01:31:59,347 --> 01:32:01,088
I didn't mean to upset anyone.
I'll leave.

1279
01:32:01,148 --> 01:32:03,719
If you don't mind,
can I ask who you are?

1280
01:32:03,784 --> 01:32:05,855
- Tony Webster.
- Uh, Ben.

1281
01:32:05,920 --> 01:32:07,464
- Do you mind if I sit down, Tony?
- Of course.

1282
01:32:07,488 --> 01:32:08,831
Cheers.

1283
01:32:10,625 --> 01:32:14,163
I was an old friend
of Adrian's father,

1284
01:32:14,228 --> 01:32:16,902
and I've recently become
reacquainted with his mother.

1285
01:32:16,964 --> 01:32:19,171
Oh, you'll understand, then.

1286
01:32:19,233 --> 01:32:21,509
She and I were
at university together.

1287
01:32:21,569 --> 01:32:24,106
Really? You don't look
old enough to have been at uni

1288
01:32:24,171 --> 01:32:27,175
- with Adrian's mum.
- You're too kind.

1289
01:32:27,241 --> 01:32:29,414
I was rather hoping to
bump into her here, but, uh...

1290
01:32:29,477 --> 01:32:31,889
Wait, wait, sorry.
Uh, bump into who?

1291
01:32:31,946 --> 01:32:34,153
Veronica.
Adrian's mother.

1292
01:32:35,816 --> 01:32:37,318
Um...

1293
01:32:37,385 --> 01:32:39,991
you understand I can't discuss
our clients' histories,

1294
01:32:40,054 --> 01:32:41,331
it's a matter of confidentiality.

1295
01:32:41,355 --> 01:32:43,164
- Yeah, of course.
- Um...

1296
01:32:43,224 --> 01:32:45,369
Now, if you are a friend of the family,
what you're saying, Tony,

1297
01:32:45,393 --> 01:32:47,339
doesn't make any sense.

1298
01:32:47,495 --> 01:32:49,372
Veronica is Adrian's sister.

1299
01:32:52,233 --> 01:32:55,544
Um, their mother, Sarah,
passed away six months ago.

1300
01:33:06,080 --> 01:33:08,390
- How did he seem?
- Cheerful.

1301
01:33:08,449 --> 01:33:10,986
Happy. Like himself.

1302
01:33:11,519 --> 01:33:13,055
Only more so.

1303
01:33:14,622 --> 01:33:17,330
As we said good-bye,
he told me he was in love.

1304
01:33:28,035 --> 01:33:31,346
You won't let Veronica get away
with too much, will you?

1305
01:33:32,306 --> 01:33:33,683
Sorry?

1306
01:33:35,042 --> 01:33:37,352
Don't let her get away
with too much.

1307
01:33:38,045 --> 01:33:39,353
Are we okay?

1308
01:33:41,449 --> 01:33:44,259
They seem very happy,
the five of them.

1309
01:33:45,453 --> 01:33:48,491
- You obviously do a good job.
- We try our best.

1310
01:33:50,157 --> 01:33:51,500
Good luck to you all.

1311
01:33:53,060 --> 01:33:54,368
I'm gonna head back
to the group.

1312
01:34:24,959 --> 01:34:27,030
(cell phone chiming)

1313
01:34:34,535 --> 01:34:36,113
Margaret: Please leave me
a message after the beep.

1314
01:34:36,137 --> 01:34:38,174
- (beeps)
- Margaret, it's me again.

1315
01:34:38,239 --> 01:34:39,445
Yeah, uh, this is it.

1316
01:34:39,507 --> 01:34:41,578
I think this is definitely it.
Where are you?

1317
01:34:42,710 --> 01:34:44,348
(cell phone beeps)

1318
01:35:04,699 --> 01:35:06,144
(sighs)

1319
01:35:07,368 --> 01:35:08,813
Tell me about your day.

1320
01:35:08,869 --> 01:35:10,314
My day?

1321
01:35:10,371 --> 01:35:12,749
Yeah. What you did.

1322
01:35:12,807 --> 01:35:15,617
Oh. Okay.
I went to High-gate.

1323
01:35:15,676 --> 01:35:17,952
To see a woman who I'd had
a relationship with

1324
01:35:18,012 --> 01:35:19,719
when I was an undergraduate.

1325
01:35:19,780 --> 01:35:21,953
We've recently become reacquainted,

1326
01:35:22,016 --> 01:35:23,859
but she wasn't there.

1327
01:35:24,919 --> 01:35:27,297
- Wasn't where?
- At home.

1328
01:35:27,354 --> 01:35:28,992
So what were you doing there?

1329
01:35:29,056 --> 01:35:31,161
I went to see her.

1330
01:35:31,225 --> 01:35:34,229
- But she wasn't there.
- No.

1331
01:35:34,295 --> 01:35:37,367
I waited around a bit, outside...

1332
01:35:37,431 --> 01:35:38,535
at the station.

1333
01:35:38,599 --> 01:35:41,273
So you're stalking her?
You're her stalker.

1334
01:35:41,335 --> 01:35:43,337
- No.
- Yes, you are.

1335
01:35:43,404 --> 01:35:44,747
No. Not at all, no.

1336
01:35:44,805 --> 01:35:46,580
No, moving on.

1337
01:35:46,640 --> 01:35:48,642
We broke up is the point.

1338
01:35:48,709 --> 01:35:51,383
While we were
still at university.

1339
01:35:51,445 --> 01:35:54,722
And not long after, she formed
a relationship with my best friend.

1340
01:35:56,550 --> 01:35:58,689
And I wrote them both

1341
01:35:58,753 --> 01:36:00,562
a very nasty letter.

1342
01:36:02,256 --> 01:36:04,702
And recently, I've been working
under the assumption

1343
01:36:04,759 --> 01:36:06,170
that they'd had a child together

1344
01:36:06,227 --> 01:36:09,401
shortly before my best friend
committed suicide.

1345
01:36:09,463 --> 01:36:11,534
But now it appears
that the mother of that child

1346
01:36:11,599 --> 01:36:14,637
wasn't my ex-girlfriend,
but it was her mother.

1347
01:36:14,702 --> 01:36:17,842
And I can only assume
that it was my...

1348
01:36:17,905 --> 01:36:20,351
horrible letter that
in some way pushed the...

1349
01:36:20,407 --> 01:36:22,387
- (knocks on door)
- friend...

1350
01:36:22,443 --> 01:36:24,548
(door opens)

1351
01:36:25,379 --> 01:36:26,380
(Susie clears throat)

1352
01:36:26,447 --> 01:36:28,051
Emma:
Hello again, Tony.

1353
01:36:28,115 --> 01:36:30,186
- Emma.
- Oh, hi, Emma.

1354
01:36:30,251 --> 01:36:31,821
- How we doing?
- (sighs)

1355
01:36:31,886 --> 01:36:34,730
I'd say holding up, just about.
(chuckles)

1356
01:36:34,789 --> 01:36:36,564
Emma: (softly)
I'll just check baby's head.

1357
01:36:38,025 --> 01:36:40,164
No, no, no.
Dad, stay.

1358
01:36:40,761 --> 01:36:42,138
Just for a bit.

1359
01:36:44,331 --> 01:36:45,833
You can hold my hand.

1360
01:36:49,637 --> 01:36:51,639
(heart monitor beeping)

1361
01:36:57,211 --> 01:36:59,350
What's going on?

1362
01:36:59,413 --> 01:37:02,326
- I don't know what's going on.
- Tony: Everything's fine.

1363
01:37:06,754 --> 01:37:08,927
Dad, why isn't anyone
saying anything?

1364
01:37:08,989 --> 01:37:10,730
Everything's absolutely fine.

1365
01:37:10,791 --> 01:37:12,828
We're nearly there,
I promise you.

1366
01:37:15,129 --> 01:37:16,574
(breathing heavily)

1367
01:37:19,066 --> 01:37:21,205
Emma:
Susie, you have a baby.

1368
01:37:21,268 --> 01:37:22,679
Congratulations.

1369
01:37:32,880 --> 01:37:34,723
Why isn't he crying?

1370
01:37:35,783 --> 01:37:37,285
He's not crying.

1371
01:37:38,953 --> 01:37:40,497
- Can you see anything?
- He's fine. He's fine.

1372
01:37:40,521 --> 01:37:41,625
Why isn't he crying?

1373
01:37:41,689 --> 01:37:43,100
Excuse me, my daughter's asking,

1374
01:37:43,157 --> 01:37:44,830
why isn't her son crying?

1375
01:37:49,430 --> 01:37:51,467
(baby crying)

1376
01:37:54,001 --> 01:37:55,480
(laughing)

1377
01:37:59,707 --> 01:38:01,744
- So proud of you.
- (Susie chuckles)

1378
01:38:08,349 --> 01:38:10,522
- I wanna see him.
- Tony: Yeah.

1379
01:38:14,555 --> 01:38:17,195
- Baby.
- Ah, look.

1380
01:38:17,258 --> 01:38:18,999
Say hello to your mummy.

1381
01:38:19,059 --> 01:38:21,198
- (Susie laughing)
- There he is.

1382
01:38:31,872 --> 01:38:33,909
- It's very hot.
- Margaret: Thank you.

1383
01:38:45,719 --> 01:38:48,393
You don't have to stay here,
you know.

1384
01:38:48,455 --> 01:38:49,798
I want to.

1385
01:38:55,729 --> 01:38:58,869
Susie said you dealt
with everything very impressively.

1386
01:38:59,800 --> 01:39:03,270
I'm not an entirely redundant
member of this family, yet.

1387
01:39:04,338 --> 01:39:07,376
- I've never said you were.
- Haven't you?

1388
01:39:12,880 --> 01:39:14,689
Where are you going?

1389
01:39:14,748 --> 01:39:16,489
I'm gonna give you some space.

1390
01:39:16,550 --> 01:39:18,359
Fine. But, uh...

1391
01:39:19,386 --> 01:39:21,764
you may be interested to know,
you probably won't,

1392
01:39:21,822 --> 01:39:24,894
but I was planning on
making an apology to you.

1393
01:39:26,393 --> 01:39:28,669
For being insensitive,
being a bore,

1394
01:39:28,729 --> 01:39:31,107
for being a monumental
pain in the arse.

1395
01:39:32,933 --> 01:39:35,709
Maybe it's too little too late,
but I hope not.

1396
01:39:37,037 --> 01:39:38,983
I know, technically,

1397
01:39:39,039 --> 01:39:40,848
we're not supposed
to make pronouncements

1398
01:39:40,908 --> 01:39:43,047
of this nature anymore, but...

1399
01:39:44,011 --> 01:39:47,788
you and Susie are the two
most important people in my life.

1400
01:39:50,250 --> 01:39:53,322
Divorced, married,
makes no difference.

1401
01:39:58,659 --> 01:40:00,605
Well, there you are.

1402
01:40:03,964 --> 01:40:05,875
Despite what you might think...

1403
01:40:07,835 --> 01:40:10,748
I assure you, I'm trying.

1404
01:40:11,638 --> 01:40:13,549
(sighs)
(tapping on watch)

1405
01:40:17,411 --> 01:40:19,448
What's wrong with your watch?

1406
01:40:20,948 --> 01:40:22,621
It's stopped.

1407
01:40:38,132 --> 01:40:39,475
(chuckling)

1408
01:40:53,747 --> 01:40:56,921
- Come on, baby.
- (both chuckling)

1409
01:40:59,486 --> 01:41:00,726
Get you home.

1410
01:41:00,788 --> 01:41:03,200
- Leaving.
- (baby crying)

1411
01:41:03,257 --> 01:41:05,294
Leaving hospital.

1412
01:41:09,563 --> 01:41:13,067
Tony: How often do we
tell our own life story?

1413
01:41:13,133 --> 01:41:17,878
How often do we adjust,
embellish, make sly cuts?

1414
01:41:17,938 --> 01:41:20,111
And the longer life goes on,

1415
01:41:20,174 --> 01:41:24,316
the fewer are those around
to tell us our life is not our life.

1416
01:41:24,378 --> 01:41:27,325
It is just a story
we've told about our lives.

1417
01:41:28,615 --> 01:41:31,221
A story about our lives
told to others,

1418
01:41:31,285 --> 01:41:33,959
but mainly to ourselves.

1419
01:41:35,823 --> 01:41:37,461
Oh, hello.
How are you?

1420
01:41:38,225 --> 01:41:40,034
- Uh, what?
- Are you well?

1421
01:41:40,094 --> 01:41:42,404
- I'm fine.
- Want a coffee?

1422
01:41:42,996 --> 01:41:43,997
Y-Yeah.

1423
01:41:49,703 --> 01:41:51,478
- (sighs)
- Mm.

1424
01:41:53,273 --> 01:41:54,650
Thank you.

1425
01:41:54,708 --> 01:41:55,709
Could you, um...

1426
01:41:55,776 --> 01:41:57,619
could you sign here, please?
I just got...

1427
01:41:57,678 --> 01:41:58,952
(device beeping)

1428
01:42:02,382 --> 01:42:03,952
Thank you.

1429
01:42:05,419 --> 01:42:07,524
Great, thank you.

1430
01:42:07,588 --> 01:42:09,124
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1431
01:42:18,899 --> 01:42:21,505
(laughing)

1432
01:42:21,568 --> 01:42:25,641
Tony: "I've been turning over
in my mind the question of nostalgia,

1433
01:42:25,706 --> 01:42:27,947
and whether! Suffer from it.

1434
01:42:29,576 --> 01:42:31,715
I suppose I am nostalgic.

1435
01:42:32,813 --> 01:42:34,918
I think of my time with Margaret

1436
01:42:34,982 --> 01:42:37,519
and Susie's birth and her first years.

1437
01:42:38,719 --> 01:42:40,426
A bunch of kids in school.

1438
01:42:40,487 --> 01:42:41,898
(all laughing)

1439
01:42:44,458 --> 01:42:46,870
A girl dancing
for once in her life.

1440
01:42:46,927 --> 01:42:48,065
(squeals)

1441
01:42:50,130 --> 01:42:54,510
A secret horizontal gesture
beneath a sunlit Wisteria.

1442
01:42:58,539 --> 01:43:01,543
I think of Adrian's
definition of history.

1443
01:43:08,182 --> 01:43:11,163
I think of everything
that has happened in my life...

1444
01:43:12,152 --> 01:43:14,723
and how little
I have allowed to happen.

1445
01:43:15,322 --> 01:43:18,030
I, who neither won nor lost.

1446
01:43:18,892 --> 01:43:21,065
Who avoided being hurt

1447
01:43:21,128 --> 01:43:23,938
and called it
a capacity for survival.

1448
01:43:29,736 --> 01:43:32,979
I think of how our lives
got entwined

1449
01:43:33,040 --> 01:43:35,850
and went along together
for a time.

1450
01:43:35,909 --> 01:43:38,253
And when I look back,

1451
01:43:38,312 --> 01:43:41,088
now, on that time,
however brief...

1452
01:43:42,783 --> 01:43:45,992
I am moved
more than I thought possible.

1453
01:43:47,754 --> 01:43:49,495
Indeed, I'm sorry
that I have known nothing

1454
01:43:49,556 --> 01:43:51,661
of your life in the years since.

1455
01:43:52,693 --> 01:43:55,970
No doubt you could have taught
this old fool a thing or two.

1456
01:44:01,568 --> 01:44:03,570
Perhaps, in a way, you have.“

1457
01:44:08,542 --> 01:44:09,885
(knocks on door)

1458
01:44:16,250 --> 01:44:18,093
- Hello.
- Surprise!

1459
01:44:18,151 --> 01:44:19,391
- Lovely surprise.
- (chuckles)

1460
01:44:20,721 --> 01:44:22,132
Hello, Joshua.

1461
01:44:22,189 --> 01:44:24,533
- Say hello to "The Mudge."
- Hello, Mudge.

1462
01:44:24,591 --> 01:44:27,162
No, you are The Mudge.
Mum and I decided.

1463
01:44:27,227 --> 01:44:28,763
On account of
your being a curmudgeon.

1464
01:44:28,829 --> 01:44:31,241
(laughs)
How are you?

1465
01:44:31,298 --> 01:44:32,299
Good.

1466
01:44:32,366 --> 01:44:34,744
The NCT group
send their love to you.

1467
01:44:34,801 --> 01:44:36,212
Oh, that's nice.

1468
01:44:36,270 --> 01:44:40,309
We had a lovely lunch comparing
the damage done to our bodies.

1469
01:44:40,374 --> 01:44:43,082
- Vaginas and all.
- Oh, Joshua, cover your ears.

1470
01:44:43,143 --> 01:44:44,663
- Cover your ears.
- (Joshua squealing)

1471
01:44:46,146 --> 01:44:47,648
(Tony chuckling)

1472
01:44:47,714 --> 01:44:49,318
Susie:
Very good.

1473
01:44:51,852 --> 01:44:53,661
Tony:
You're a special young man.

1474
01:45:00,761 --> 01:45:02,763
(music playing)
