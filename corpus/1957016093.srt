00:00:23,980 --> 00:00:25,329
[Ethan] I'm trapped.

6
00:00:25,416 --> 00:00:26,635
- Ethan.
- You've made me unemployable.

7
00:00:26,722 --> 00:00:28,724
[Paul] Ethan, stop.

8
00:00:28,811 --> 00:00:30,813
If you're determined to go, go.

9
00:00:31,814 --> 00:00:33,511
Good luck.

10
00:00:33,598 --> 00:00:36,775
But you'll get no credit
here, and no support from me.

11
00:00:36,862 --> 00:00:39,082
You'll be doing this
on your own.

12
00:00:39,169 --> 00:00:41,302
[Ethan] Oh, so this is
about my consciousness work.

13
00:00:41,389 --> 00:00:42,216
[Paul] Not yours.

14
00:00:43,956 --> 00:00:46,307
Everything generated here
belongs to the university.

15
00:00:46,394 --> 00:00:47,525
[Ethan] You mean you?

16
00:00:47,612 --> 00:00:49,092
[Paul] That's how this works.

Every thought, every half-baked
idea inside your head

18
00:00:56,404 --> 00:00:57,753

Okay, I swear, I can't with
him.

24
00:01:56,028 --> 00:01:57,726
He would starve if I
didn't tell him to eat.

25
00:01:57,813 --> 00:02:00,294
- So.
- Wait, you opened my mail?

26
00:02:00,381 --> 00:02:02,165
- I did.
- You can't do that.

27
00:02:02,252 --> 00:02:05,734
Dr. Ethan Kochar, we are
grateful for the opportunity

28
00:02:05,821 --> 00:02:07,518
to consider your article.
[giggling]

29
00:02:07,605 --> 00:02:08,998
We are pleased to inform you...

30
00:02:09,085 --> 00:02:10,695
- Read the punchline.
- I know, I know,

31
00:02:10,782 --> 00:02:12,610
that your article on
protein folding and memory

32
00:02:12,697 --> 00:02:16,310
will be the focus of the March
5th publication of Nature.

33
00:02:16,397 --> 00:02:18,399
What?
[applauding]

34
00:02:18,486 --> 00:02:19,226
You serious?

35
00:02:19,313 --> 00:02:20,792
Pretty good.

36
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:22,838
See, I should open
your mail more often.

37
00:02:25,319 --> 00:02:27,059
[mumbling]

38
00:02:28,235 --> 00:02:32,848
Believe it or not, that
is not a telenovela clip.

39
00:02:33,588 --> 00:02:36,112
It is a memory of yours truly

40
00:02:36,199 --> 00:02:40,160
from when I made
the cover of Nature.

41
00:02:41,291 --> 00:02:45,861
So how did we capture it?

42
00:02:47,689 --> 00:02:49,169
You'll recall that
memories exist

43
00:02:49,256 --> 00:02:52,259
as physical imprints
on the brain.

44
00:02:53,173 --> 00:02:57,089
The R-9X identifies
these engrams

45
00:02:57,177 --> 00:02:58,917
based on their
protein expressions

46
00:02:59,004 --> 00:03:01,746
and transfers that data from
our internal hard drives

47
00:03:01,833 --> 00:03:03,748
to external ones.

48
00:03:03,835 --> 00:03:06,664
But making those memories
legible is a challenge

49
00:03:06,751 --> 00:03:07,796
in and of itself.

50
00:03:07,883 --> 00:03:10,059
You remember Berkeley, 2011.

51
00:03:10,146 --> 00:03:13,628
Before I took over, the
R-9X could not render images

52
00:03:13,715 --> 00:03:15,282
more clear than that.

53
00:03:16,718 --> 00:03:19,851
So what do you think was
missing?

54
00:03:23,377 --> 00:03:24,204
[Rachel] Emotions?

55
00:03:25,074 --> 00:03:26,945
Thank you, Rachel, yes.

56
00:03:27,032 --> 00:03:30,906
Euphoria, fear, lust.

57
00:03:32,168 --> 00:03:36,477
Every memory is tied to an
emotional section of our brain,

58
00:03:36,564 --> 00:03:40,829
even the ones that we bury
deep in our subconscious.

A sound, a smell, a shape

63
00:04:07,899 --> 00:04:09,945
is all it takes for recall.

[whimsical music]

70
00:05:02,911 --> 00:05:07,176
So to get to legible memories,

71
00:05:07,263 --> 00:05:10,135
I knew that mapping emotions was
key.

72
00:05:10,832 --> 00:05:13,313
May 16th, 2019.

73
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:19,667
Previous findings show that
the R-9X can download memories.

74
00:05:21,146 --> 00:05:24,149
Current experimentation is
a progression of that work.

75
00:05:25,194 --> 00:05:28,719
Our major premise, the
link between our emotions

76
00:05:28,806 --> 00:05:32,157
and our accumulated memories
regulates human consciousness.

77
00:05:33,202 --> 00:05:37,032
Minor premise, the R-10
can isolate the sections

78
00:05:37,119 --> 00:05:41,166
of the brain which impact
emotions and behavior.

79
00:05:41,253 --> 00:05:44,344
Conclusion, the R-10 is capable

80
00:05:44,431 --> 00:05:46,346
of controlling human
consciousness.

81
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:55,616
[whirring]

82
00:05:56,443 --> 00:06:00,882
So why does this matter anyway?

83
00:06:02,579 --> 00:06:05,277
I mean, it's nice to be
able to watch our memories

84
00:06:05,365 --> 00:06:08,585
like home videos, but to what
end?

85
00:06:10,544 --> 00:06:12,546
What about affecting
consciousness?

86
00:06:14,069 --> 00:06:16,332
The emotions tied to memories

87
00:06:16,419 --> 00:06:18,682
exist along synaptic pathways,
right?

88
00:06:18,769 --> 00:06:23,208
So what if our ideal
self's just a question

89
00:06:23,295 --> 00:06:26,211
of turning the right ones on and
off?

90
00:06:32,087 --> 00:06:33,784
Isn't that, like, unethical?

91
00:06:33,871 --> 00:06:35,395
Ah, there he is.

92
00:06:36,265 --> 00:06:37,701
All right, how so, Mitchell?

93
00:06:38,572 --> 00:06:40,051
[Mitchell] We're talking about
altering

94
00:06:40,138 --> 00:06:41,618
what makes you you.

95
00:06:41,705 --> 00:06:44,012
Does anybody else find
Mitchell's stubbornness,

96
00:06:44,099 --> 00:06:44,404
endearing or
is it just me?

97
00:06:46,362 --> 00:06:49,321
I'm talking about a machine
calibrated to the individual.

98
00:06:50,322 --> 00:06:54,414
A machine that can erase a
veteran's PTSD,

99
00:06:55,632 --> 00:06:58,940
that suppresses the reward
center for an opioid junkie,

100
00:07:00,289 --> 00:07:02,509
and that could boost your
intellect.

101
00:07:02,596 --> 00:07:05,468
I'm sure some of you
could benefit from that.

102
00:07:05,555 --> 00:07:09,777
Imagine, consciousness
constructed to your own liking.

103
00:07:11,082 --> 00:07:14,085
Memories curated to a desired
state.

104
00:07:14,172 --> 00:07:17,480
And yes, perhaps,

105
00:07:17,567 --> 00:07:20,570
changing yourself for the
better.

106
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:25,575
All right, well, that's
enough for this week.

107
00:07:25,662 --> 00:07:29,579
Be sure to read my essay on
the self and temporal sequence

108
00:07:29,666 --> 00:07:31,755
by next class.

109
00:07:32,974 --> 00:07:33,844
Have a great week.

Still struggling with the
initiation.

111
00:07:49,512 --> 00:07:51,601
But I've ruled out the
distributors,

112
00:07:51,688 --> 00:07:54,865
so it must be the equation.

113
00:07:56,476 --> 00:07:58,739
[keys clicking]

114
00:07:58,826 --> 00:08:02,612
Side note, I had another
blackout this morning.

115
00:08:04,005 --> 00:08:08,357
Indeterminate time, but they
are becoming more frequent.

116
00:08:09,445 --> 00:08:11,752
I'm still hoping that
the R-10 can pinpoint.

117
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:56,013
[] A man whose journey into
the mind

118
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:59,060
is the basis for all those who
come after.

119
00:09:00,322 --> 00:09:03,804
His work, fully realized in the
R-9X,

120
00:09:03,891 --> 00:09:07,155
is perhaps the most
groundbreaking discovery

121
00:09:07,242 --> 00:09:09,026
of this century.

122
00:09:09,113 --> 00:09:13,770
With applications from
education to national security.

123
00:09:14,858 --> 00:09:17,861
So before I present the
plaque for our new lab,

124
00:09:17,948 --> 00:09:21,648
I've asked Dr. Kochar's
partner to say a few words.

125
00:09:21,735 --> 00:09:26,130
The co-creator of the
R-9X, Dr. Malcolm Bloom.

127
00:09:31,919 --> 00:09:35,836
Thank you, Dean Myers, and
thank you all for coming.

128
00:09:36,924 --> 00:09:40,667
We were all fortunate
enough to know Dr. Kochar.

129
00:09:41,624 --> 00:09:43,713
But for a cocksure doctoral
student,

130
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:47,195
a position in his lab was dumb
luck.

131
00:09:48,762 --> 00:09:51,895
I never questioned his
judgment, never had to.

132
00:09:53,636 --> 00:09:56,857
Until he asked me to be his
partner.

133
00:09:56,944 --> 00:09:59,163
[chuckling]

134
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:02,297
You can say that I knew
Paul better than most.

135
00:10:02,384 --> 00:10:03,777
No one could match his
brilliance.

136
00:10:05,561 --> 00:10:09,957
Kendall, Kahneman, Einstein,
these are his equals.

137
00:10:11,393 --> 00:10:14,091
We'll be hard-pressed to see
Dr. Paul Kochar's influence

138
00:10:14,178 --> 00:10:16,180
matched in our lifetime.

139
00:10:21,142 --> 00:10:22,839
[smooth rock music]

140
00:10:22,926 --> 00:10:24,145
There's the wunderkind.

141
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:28,453
You're a hard man to track down.

142
00:10:30,499 --> 00:10:31,369
How's it coming?

143
00:10:32,806 --> 00:10:34,111
- Good.
- Good.

144
00:10:34,851 --> 00:10:36,157
That's good to hear.

145
00:10:36,244 --> 00:10:37,375
Good enough for tomorrow.

146
00:10:38,507 --> 00:10:39,813
I thought you rescheduled.

147
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:41,858
I did, for tomorrow.

148
00:10:41,945 --> 00:10:42,729
No.

149
00:10:42,816 --> 00:10:43,947
No, no, no, no.

150
00:10:44,034 --> 00:10:45,557
Come on, Ethan, work with me,

151
00:10:45,645 --> 00:10:47,081
so I can keep the committee off
your back.

152
00:10:47,168 --> 00:10:49,561
[Ethan] Yeah, well, you do it
best.

153
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:51,085
Well I've got practice.

154
00:10:51,172 --> 00:10:53,435
Ethan, look, you're going
through a lot.

155
00:10:53,522 --> 00:10:54,523
I get it, we all miss your dad.

156
00:10:56,394 --> 00:10:58,919
They'll replace you with someone
else if you don't deliver.

157
00:10:59,006 --> 00:11:00,529
I thought I already did.

158
00:11:03,010 --> 00:11:05,229
I fought hard for your credit,

159
00:11:05,316 --> 00:11:08,015
but the R-9 was started
with your father and me.

160
00:11:11,714 --> 00:11:13,281
You want one?

161
00:11:13,368 --> 00:11:14,586
No, I quit.

162
00:11:14,674 --> 00:11:15,544
Really?

163
00:11:18,242 --> 00:11:21,506
Everyone who matters knows
you finished the R-9.

164
00:11:21,593 --> 00:11:23,465
Forget the patent plaque.

Please, Ethan.

It's, it's not ready.

168
00:11:30,472 --> 00:11:31,952
Then bullshit your way through.

00:11:32,039 --> 00:11:34,345
Whatever you're working on,
present it.

00:11:34,432 --> 00:11:36,608
Ethan, we need this renewal.

I'm gonna need you at 9:30.

00:11:37,827 --> 00:11:39,046
I need you to be there tomorrow.

Sir.

177
00:11:55,584 --> 00:11:57,586
Are you sure you want another?

00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:00,328
Yeah.

00:26:52,045 --> 00:26:53,350
I got a little tied up here.

361
00:26:58,007 --> 00:26:58,921
All right.

362
00:26:59,618 --> 00:27:01,054
Open the door.

363
00:27:01,141 --> 00:27:02,011
I can't do that.

364
00:27:03,665 --> 00:27:05,711
I'll talk to you tomorrow, I
promise.

365
00:27:05,798 --> 00:27:09,671
Hey, you're not the only
person on this project.

366
00:27:10,672 --> 00:27:12,805
You fuck up, it comes back on
me.

367
00:27:15,329 --> 00:27:17,636
Malcolm, the only reason
why they listen to you

368
00:27:17,723 --> 00:27:19,681
is because you got me to come
back.

369
00:27:22,858 --> 00:27:26,383
My work on this project
was just as crucial as yours.

370
00:27:27,384 --> 00:27:28,908
You wanna escalate this?

371
00:27:28,995 --> 00:27:30,997
I'm more than happy to involve
the police.

372
00:27:31,084 --> 00:27:33,173
[tense music]

373
00:27:33,260 --> 00:27:36,263
Either way, you're gonna open up
the door.

374
00:27:42,051 --> 00:27:42,965
Okay.

375
00:27:44,010 --> 00:27:46,055
Just give me a minute.

376
00:27:56,196 --> 00:27:59,155
[thunder rumbling]

377
00:28:10,427 --> 00:28:12,778
[rumbling]

378
00:28:14,997 --> 00:28:18,218
[distorted singing]

379
00:28:28,881 --> 00:28:30,709
Oh, baby.

380
00:28:30,796 --> 00:28:33,189
Like an angel!
[laughing]

381
00:28:33,276 --> 00:28:34,147
Shut up.

382
00:28:34,234 --> 00:28:35,801
See, time is curved.

383
00:28:36,889 --> 00:28:38,804
This is how it's supposed to be.

384
00:28:38,891 --> 00:28:42,198
[distorted chatting]

385
00:28:50,511 --> 00:28:52,861
[laughing]

386
00:29:07,789 --> 00:29:10,923
[foreboding music]

387
00:29:27,940 --> 00:29:29,855
[clicking]

388
00:29:29,942 --> 00:29:31,595
Okay.

389
00:29:31,682 --> 00:29:33,859
It's 1:32 p.m.

390
00:29:33,946 --> 00:29:35,382
I've installed four
wireless security cameras

391
00:29:35,469 --> 00:29:37,950
around the house so we
can track my behaviors.

392
00:29:38,037 --> 00:29:39,734
Instead of suppressing
my competing emotions,

393
00:29:39,821 --> 00:29:41,431
it seems we've isolated them.

394
00:29:41,518 --> 00:29:45,000
Looks like 10 sections,
including the default.

395
00:29:45,087 --> 00:29:47,655
Be sure to take precautions
against any outliers.

396
00:29:49,875 --> 00:29:50,745
Time to work.

397
00:30:03,627 --> 00:30:06,587
[unsettling music]

398
00:30:24,910 --> 00:30:26,259
Can anybody hear me?

399
00:30:27,651 --> 00:30:28,957
Hello!

400
00:30:29,044 --> 00:30:29,958
- Alli?
- Ethan, what the fuck?

401
00:30:30,045 --> 00:30:31,351
What, what happened?

402
00:30:31,438 --> 00:30:32,395
- You tell me!
- No, I don't know

403
00:30:32,482 --> 00:30:33,701
what you're doing here.

404
00:30:33,788 --> 00:30:35,224
[Alli] Malcolm sent me, I told
you that.

405
00:30:35,311 --> 00:30:36,660
Why are you in this room?

406
00:30:36,747 --> 00:30:38,271
You locked me in.

407
00:30:38,358 --> 00:30:41,665
You took my phone, you
were all over the place.

408
00:30:44,668 --> 00:30:45,713
Hello?

409
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:47,280
You were trying to fuck me.

410
00:30:47,367 --> 00:30:49,543
And then you passed out, and
I...

411
00:30:49,630 --> 00:30:52,546
[rumbling]

412
00:30:52,633 --> 00:30:53,503
Ethan?

413
00:30:55,810 --> 00:30:56,637
Ethan.

414
00:31:02,208 --> 00:31:05,298
[whimsical music]

415
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:10,390
What are you doing here?

416
00:31:15,177 --> 00:31:17,701
I screwed everything up.

417
00:31:17,788 --> 00:31:19,051
No, wait, wait.

418
00:31:19,138 --> 00:31:20,791
Please, please, please,
don't go.

419
00:31:20,879 --> 00:31:22,358
- Please don't.
- Okay.

420
00:31:22,445 --> 00:31:24,708
- Please don't leave me.
- Ethan, calm down.

421
00:31:26,232 --> 00:31:27,624
I'll be right back, okay?

422
00:32:00,831 --> 00:32:03,225
[Ethan] What are you doing in
there?

423
00:32:03,312 --> 00:32:05,445
Ethan, just tell me what's
going on.

424
00:32:07,273 --> 00:32:09,188
Tell me what the fuck
you were doing in there.

425
00:32:09,275 --> 00:32:11,973
[ominous music]

426
00:32:13,757 --> 00:32:14,715
Don't, no, no, no!

427
00:32:14,802 --> 00:32:16,021
- No!
- Get out!

428
00:32:16,108 --> 00:32:20,025
[banging]
Open the door, Alli!

429
00:32:20,112 --> 00:32:22,157
Open the door, open the door!

430
00:32:22,244 --> 00:32:24,899
[Alli] Malcolm, it's me, I'm
at Ethan's.

431
00:32:25,682 --> 00:32:27,162
- Something's happened.
- Baby?

432
00:32:27,249 --> 00:32:28,685
Just call me when you get
this,

433
00:32:28,772 --> 00:32:30,035
or I'll explain when I
get back to the office.

434
00:32:30,122 --> 00:32:31,297
[Ethan] Can I come in?

435
00:32:33,081 --> 00:32:35,736
Hey, I'm sorry, I don't
know what happened before.

436
00:32:37,651 --> 00:32:41,002
Hey, remember when we
went down to the stacks,

437
00:32:41,089 --> 00:32:45,876
and oh god, you were so wild.

438
00:32:46,312 --> 00:32:48,053
[chuckling]

439
00:32:48,140 --> 00:32:51,708
I can't stop thinking about it.

440
00:32:54,581 --> 00:32:56,104
I want you so bad right now.

441
00:32:56,191 --> 00:32:58,672
[thudding]

442
00:33:02,197 --> 00:33:03,807
Ethan?

443
00:33:03,894 --> 00:33:04,765
Ethan.

444
00:33:05,505 --> 00:33:06,810
Ethan, wake up.

445
00:33:18,039 --> 00:33:19,084
[door closes]

446
00:33:19,171 --> 00:33:19,998
Alli?

447
00:33:22,870 --> 00:33:24,002
Alli, please wait.

448
00:33:26,221 --> 00:33:27,527
Look, Ethan, back off.

449
00:33:27,614 --> 00:33:29,094
Alli, please wait.

450
00:33:30,182 --> 00:33:31,966
This is monumental for both of
us.

451
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:36,275
Last night I had a breakthrough,

452
00:33:36,362 --> 00:33:38,016
but it left my consciousness
fractured,

453
00:33:38,103 --> 00:33:40,453
so now there are 10 of us.

454
00:33:40,540 --> 00:33:42,107
But we each only have
six minutes every hour,

455
00:33:42,194 --> 00:33:44,109
which is why I need your help.

456
00:33:44,196 --> 00:33:45,849
I only have a few minutes left.

457
00:33:45,936 --> 00:33:48,722
I need you to wait here
'til the top of the hour.

458
00:33:48,809 --> 00:33:51,116
That's when the default
is back in control.

459
00:33:53,205 --> 00:33:54,032
Look.

460
00:33:57,470 --> 00:33:59,820
I think you're gonna
wanna see where this goes.

461
00:34:02,649 --> 00:34:05,565
[clock ticking]

462
00:34:36,987 --> 00:34:38,424
That's the R-10.

463
00:34:38,511 --> 00:34:39,990
It's a build out of the R-9,

464
00:34:40,078 --> 00:34:42,341
but it can direct energy
at emotion and behavior.

465
00:34:42,428 --> 00:34:45,518
I finally got it to map, so I
figured, okay, what the hell.

466
00:34:45,605 --> 00:34:48,129
Let's isolate my
intellect, see the effect.

467
00:34:49,261 --> 00:34:51,872
But this morning, I wake up,

468
00:34:51,959 --> 00:34:56,050
and suddenly I'm skipping
through time.

469
00:34:56,137 --> 00:34:57,791
I'd been having these blackouts,
so I figured it was that,

470
00:34:57,878 --> 00:35:02,187
but it keeps happening, like
clockwork.

471
00:35:02,274 --> 00:35:04,885
Six minutes every hour.

472
00:35:06,887 --> 00:35:08,976
So what were the blackouts
before?

473
00:35:10,586 --> 00:35:12,806
Another experiment after my
dad died.

474
00:35:15,461 --> 00:35:16,026
Okay.

475
00:35:17,767 --> 00:35:19,508
So you were trying to cycle
through these fragments?

476
00:35:19,595 --> 00:35:21,902
No, I wanted to attenuate
the others for an hour,

477
00:35:21,989 --> 00:35:25,384
but the sequencing's off,
so every six minutes,

478
00:35:25,471 --> 00:35:27,255
another section gets a turn.

479
00:35:27,342 --> 00:35:28,865
Like DID.

480
00:35:28,952 --> 00:35:31,216
Kind of, but these aren't
personalities.

481
00:35:31,303 --> 00:35:32,217
It's all still me.

482
00:35:34,175 --> 00:35:36,873
So what were you trying to
isolate?

483
00:35:37,613 --> 00:35:38,658
Hard to say.

484
00:35:40,225 --> 00:35:41,617
The patterns for intellect
are easy to spot,

485
00:35:41,704 --> 00:35:43,358
but the others are less
pronounced.

486
00:35:47,493 --> 00:35:48,929
You know, there are some
things

487
00:35:49,016 --> 00:35:50,713
you shouldn't try to control.

488
00:35:55,370 --> 00:35:57,807
[rumbling]

489
00:36:02,290 --> 00:36:04,162
What's it feel like when you
shift?

490
00:36:10,516 --> 00:36:11,386
Headache.

491
00:36:12,735 --> 00:36:14,650
Everything gets fuzzy.

492
00:36:14,737 --> 00:36:16,609
I feel like I'm underwater.

493
00:36:16,696 --> 00:36:18,393
Why?

494
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:20,743
I was thinking, sometimes
dissociative patients

495
00:36:20,830 --> 00:36:23,398
can fight off a shift if
they know the triggers.

496
00:36:23,485 --> 00:36:27,141
So if this is similar, maybe
you can push through, too.

497
00:36:27,228 --> 00:36:28,055
Yeah, maybe.

498
00:36:29,926 --> 00:36:32,320
The next time you feel it
coming, just try to focus.

499
00:36:32,407 --> 00:36:33,408
It could buy us time.

500
00:36:34,540 --> 00:36:36,542
[beeping]

501
00:36:36,629 --> 00:36:38,326
Don't touch that, Ethan.

502
00:36:38,413 --> 00:36:39,066
Did you do that?

503
00:36:40,981 --> 00:36:42,330
I'm presetting this video
to play during your section.

504
00:36:42,417 --> 00:36:45,290
That's section five, my
intellect.

505
00:36:45,377 --> 00:36:46,900
He's the one I talked to.

506
00:36:48,249 --> 00:36:51,470
So, the cycling is not
sustainable.

507
00:36:51,557 --> 00:36:53,733
We're losing too much oxygen,
which means we're getting

508
00:36:53,820 --> 00:36:55,822
some cortical-spreading
depression.

509
00:36:55,909 --> 00:36:58,303
And these headaches, they're
gonna get worse and worse

510
00:36:58,390 --> 00:36:59,739
'til there's cell death.

511
00:36:59,826 --> 00:37:00,957
We need to get
to the reintegration

512
00:37:01,044 --> 00:37:02,307
as fast as possible.

513
00:37:02,394 --> 00:37:04,178
You're the one section that's in
balance,

514
00:37:04,265 --> 00:37:06,920
so we need to map you across the
whole.

515
00:37:07,007 --> 00:37:08,487
That's the reintegration,

516
00:37:08,574 --> 00:37:12,142
it's like a reboot using
your consciousness.

517
00:37:13,143 --> 00:37:15,058
Okay, you have 20
seconds before you shift.

518
00:37:15,145 --> 00:37:17,278
When that happens, Alli, I'm
gonna need you to go to my room

519
00:37:17,365 --> 00:37:18,497
and lock the door.

520
00:37:18,584 --> 00:37:20,325
I'll need you back here at 6:30.

521
00:37:20,412 --> 00:37:22,544
Interact with only me and the
default.

522
00:37:24,938 --> 00:37:26,244
You have five seconds.

523
00:37:27,767 --> 00:37:28,594
[rumbling]

524
00:37:28,681 --> 00:37:29,725
[ringing]

525
00:37:29,812 --> 00:37:31,161
[groans]

526
00:37:31,249 --> 00:37:32,119
Ethan.

527
00:37:35,775 --> 00:37:37,690
Ethan, just look at me.

528
00:37:39,561 --> 00:37:42,172
You gotta try, Ethan, come on.

529
00:37:50,529 --> 00:37:53,271
[solemn music]

530
00:37:59,625 --> 00:38:02,367
[keys clicking]

531
00:38:04,717 --> 00:38:07,459
[Ethan] Okay, section one now.

532
00:38:10,505 --> 00:38:12,899
[Alli] It's up.

533
00:38:12,986 --> 00:38:14,292
There's no system confirmation,

534
00:38:14,379 --> 00:38:15,510
but it's showing a power drop.

535
00:38:17,295 --> 00:38:19,297
[Ethan] Still not isolating
the coils correctly.

536
00:38:21,473 --> 00:38:24,389
What about the old sequential
startup?

537
00:38:24,476 --> 00:38:25,738
[Ethan] Good idea.

538
00:38:25,825 --> 00:38:27,087
Which coil's reading?

539
00:38:28,697 --> 00:38:29,611
C14.

540
00:38:31,004 --> 00:38:32,440
[Ethan] I've got that one,
too.

541
00:38:33,833 --> 00:38:36,314
[groaning]

542
00:38:37,532 --> 00:38:38,403
You okay?

543
00:38:40,143 --> 00:38:41,580
[Ethan] Yeah, I'm fine.

544
00:38:44,539 --> 00:38:46,324
Try C14 and D5.

545
00:38:48,456 --> 00:38:49,327
Okay.

546
00:38:50,023 --> 00:38:51,111
Anything?

547
00:38:52,025 --> 00:38:53,113
[Ethan] No.

548
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:54,680
Distributor must be fried.

549
00:38:56,203 --> 00:38:57,944
It'll have to be hand-wired.

550
00:38:58,031 --> 00:39:01,382
Then spike my dopamine
levels or risk a coma.

551
00:39:01,469 --> 00:39:03,558
So we'll need a dopamine
agonist.

552
00:39:03,645 --> 00:39:05,081
[Ethan] You are correct.

553
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:10,696
We'll be in good hands when you
take over.

554
00:39:14,221 --> 00:39:15,657
What are you talking about?

555
00:39:15,744 --> 00:39:17,746
Look, if you want what you're
after,

556
00:39:17,833 --> 00:39:19,705
just focus on getting
default in one piece.

557
00:39:21,054 --> 00:39:23,622
He'll need you to be the
face of the project anyway.

558
00:39:29,018 --> 00:39:31,369
[beeping]

559
00:39:36,025 --> 00:39:38,637
[raspy breathing]

560
00:39:38,724 --> 00:39:41,596
[nurse murmuring]

561
00:39:44,817 --> 00:39:47,428
[solemn music]

562
00:40:11,147 --> 00:40:12,410
- Hey.
- Hey.

563
00:40:13,889 --> 00:40:15,238
[Ethan] Where were you?

564
00:40:15,325 --> 00:40:16,414
The animal lab.

565
00:40:18,459 --> 00:40:20,548
Ethan, come here.

566
00:40:23,290 --> 00:40:24,422
Look at me.

567
00:40:25,901 --> 00:40:26,772
How do you feel?

568
00:40:27,816 --> 00:40:28,687
I'm fine.

569
00:40:31,167 --> 00:40:32,691
Why were you at the animal lab?

570
00:40:33,779 --> 00:40:36,477
We needed MDMA for the
reboot, intellect sent me.

571
00:40:36,564 --> 00:40:37,913
[Ethan] Intellect sent you?

572
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:38,871
[Alli] Yeah.

573
00:40:40,046 --> 00:40:41,482
Okay, we need to figure out

574
00:40:41,569 --> 00:40:44,311
who the hell these other
sections are.

575
00:40:44,398 --> 00:40:47,053
[keys clicking]

576
00:40:47,140 --> 00:40:49,534
[laughing]

577
00:40:49,621 --> 00:40:51,274
I was dancing with your
grandmother

578
00:40:51,361 --> 00:40:52,493
- at one point.
- Uh-huh, you did.

579
00:40:52,580 --> 00:40:55,409
[fireworks popping]
[oohing]

580
00:40:55,496 --> 00:40:57,411
There's some fireworks over
there, Ethan.

581
00:40:57,498 --> 00:40:58,978
Ethan, I promise that's not
gonna help.

582
00:40:59,065 --> 00:41:00,588
Just put it down, put it down.

583
00:41:00,675 --> 00:41:02,460
We're just gonna work through
this, okay?

584
00:41:02,547 --> 00:41:05,158
These herring bodies are
releasing doses of oxytocin,

585
00:41:05,245 --> 00:41:06,812
dopamine from the basal ganglia,
too,

586
00:41:06,899 --> 00:41:10,250
coming in at minute 54,
that's section nine.

587
00:41:10,337 --> 00:41:11,207
[Alli] Euphoria.

588
00:41:11,294 --> 00:41:12,948
Oh my god!

589
00:41:13,035 --> 00:41:14,080
What?
[laughing]

590
00:41:14,167 --> 00:41:15,908
Appreciate you, ma'am.

591
00:41:16,909 --> 00:41:18,563
What do you want me to do?

592
00:41:18,650 --> 00:41:20,478
[Alli] I mean, need some
self-restraint, maybe.

593
00:41:20,565 --> 00:41:23,089
See this concentration
of serotonin transporters?

594
00:41:23,176 --> 00:41:25,395
Yeah, kicking in at minute
six.

595
00:41:25,483 --> 00:41:27,441
[murmuring]

596
00:41:27,528 --> 00:41:28,921
Generalized anxiety.

597
00:41:30,009 --> 00:41:30,836
Section one.

598
00:41:32,533 --> 00:41:34,404
Certain cultures, it's
considered very masculine.

599
00:41:34,492 --> 00:41:36,494
[Alli] [laughing] Which
cultures?

600
00:41:37,495 --> 00:41:38,844
Several of them.

601
00:41:38,931 --> 00:41:40,715
[chatting]

602
00:41:40,802 --> 00:41:43,501
[gentle music]

603
00:41:43,588 --> 00:41:46,678
[thunder rumbling]

604
00:41:53,119 --> 00:41:53,989
[Alli] It's okay.

605
00:41:54,076 --> 00:41:56,992
[breathing deeply]

606
00:42:01,127 --> 00:42:02,128
I'm sorry.

607
00:42:05,566 --> 00:42:06,567
I'm sorry.

608
00:42:12,747 --> 00:42:16,621
Okay, so we have the nine
sections after default.

609
00:42:16,708 --> 00:42:18,623
Section one, anxiety.

610
00:42:18,710 --> 00:42:22,322
Then 12 minutes in, section two,
anger.

611
00:42:22,409 --> 00:42:23,497
[whimsical music]

612
00:42:23,584 --> 00:42:25,238
Section three is libido.

613
00:42:30,286 --> 00:42:32,071
Section four is unconscious.

614
00:42:32,158 --> 00:42:33,725
Right, all sections asleep.

615
00:42:33,812 --> 00:42:35,378
Which is the opposite of you,
default,

616
00:42:35,465 --> 00:42:37,772
all sections awake and in
balance.

617
00:42:37,859 --> 00:42:40,688
We know that section five is
intellect.

618
00:42:40,775 --> 00:42:42,603
And then section six...

619
00:42:45,693 --> 00:42:46,999
Calling him primitive.

620
00:42:48,130 --> 00:42:50,176
Section seven, creative.

621
00:42:51,438 --> 00:42:54,572
And section nine, euphoria.

622
00:42:55,355 --> 00:42:57,009
So we just need section eight.

623
00:43:00,882 --> 00:43:02,318
Let's take a look at the tape.

624
00:43:08,237 --> 00:43:10,065
Okay, now section eight.

625
00:43:19,640 --> 00:43:20,772
[keys clicking]

626
00:43:20,859 --> 00:43:22,121
[Ethan] Wait, stop.

627
00:43:29,476 --> 00:43:30,782
[Alli] Look.

628
00:43:31,870 --> 00:43:33,872
Aw, for fuck's sake.

629
00:43:33,959 --> 00:43:34,742
[Alli] What?

630
00:43:34,829 --> 00:43:35,874
The notebook.

631
00:43:37,789 --> 00:43:41,053
I got a notebook in the
mail, it was one of my dad's.

632
00:43:41,140 --> 00:43:42,315
Check, check the drawer.

633
00:43:47,799 --> 00:43:50,323
Had this equation.

634
00:43:50,410 --> 00:43:52,412
Yes, this is all his
handwriting.

635
00:43:53,413 --> 00:43:54,327
Jesus.

636
00:43:55,633 --> 00:43:56,634
Yeah.

637
00:43:59,201 --> 00:44:00,420
This is mine.

638
00:44:00,507 --> 00:44:02,422
[foreboding music]

639
00:44:02,509 --> 00:44:04,990
I don't remember any of this.

640
00:44:07,949 --> 00:44:09,995
[banging]

641
00:44:13,607 --> 00:44:15,609
[ringing]
[rumbling]

642
00:44:15,696 --> 00:44:16,741
Ethan.

643
00:44:17,698 --> 00:44:18,786
Ethan.

644
00:44:18,873 --> 00:44:20,962
Come on, try to focus.

645
00:44:29,492 --> 00:44:30,972
[grunting]

646
00:44:31,059 --> 00:44:33,235
[banging]

647
00:44:33,322 --> 00:44:34,454
[Ethan] Can't breathe.

648
00:44:34,541 --> 00:44:36,543
I can't fucking breathe!

649
00:44:43,811 --> 00:44:46,161
[shouting]

650
00:45:49,572 --> 00:45:52,445
[phone vibrating]

651
00:45:57,929 --> 00:45:59,844
[phone ringing]

652
00:45:59,931 --> 00:46:02,934
[phone vibrating]

653
00:46:16,295 --> 00:46:18,514
[rumbling]

654
00:46:25,957 --> 00:46:27,610
Did you do this?

655
00:46:27,697 --> 00:46:29,656
[Ethan] No, my guess is
that it was section eight.

656
00:46:29,743 --> 00:46:31,397
If so, we need to move him.

657
00:46:31,484 --> 00:46:33,399
- What are you doing?
- Calling the police.

658
00:46:33,486 --> 00:46:35,227
[Ethan] Alli, if you do that,
they'll take away the work.

659
00:46:35,314 --> 00:46:38,317
We'll never get it back, and
I'll probably go to prison.

660
00:46:40,058 --> 00:46:41,581
The R-10's almost ready.

661
00:46:41,668 --> 00:46:42,887
We wipe his memories and
we get him out of here

662
00:46:42,974 --> 00:46:44,627
like nothing happened.

663
00:46:44,714 --> 00:46:46,891
This is insane, this whole
fucking thing is insane.

664
00:46:46,978 --> 00:46:48,544
[Ethan] We have to protect the
work.

665
00:46:48,631 --> 00:46:49,763
It's that important.

666
00:46:49,850 --> 00:46:51,069
[coughing]

667
00:46:51,156 --> 00:46:53,767
[tense music]

668
00:46:55,987 --> 00:46:59,294
If I do this, it's
not to protect the work.

669
00:47:00,905 --> 00:47:02,036
[Ethan] Let me get his head.

670
00:47:02,123 --> 00:47:03,429
- I got his head.
- Okay.

671
00:47:03,516 --> 00:47:04,909
How long before the R-10's
ready?

672
00:47:04,996 --> 00:47:07,041
[Ethan] A few more cycles.

673
00:47:07,128 --> 00:47:08,564
Can you manage this?

674
00:47:11,785 --> 00:47:14,832
You can't tell any of the
others, not even the default.

675
00:47:16,007 --> 00:47:18,183
I need him to focus on the
reintegration.

676
00:47:19,880 --> 00:47:23,231
Malcolm will be fine, trust me.

677
00:47:33,024 --> 00:47:35,374
[beeping]

678
00:47:37,332 --> 00:47:41,206
[heart monitor flatlining]

679
00:47:46,167 --> 00:47:49,388
[nurse murmuring]

680
00:47:49,475 --> 00:47:51,607
[ringing]

681
00:47:55,220 --> 00:47:58,397
[muffled chatting]

682
00:48:00,225 --> 00:48:01,661
[Paul] Ethan.

683
00:48:02,923 --> 00:48:05,273
You should never have left.

684
00:48:06,971 --> 00:48:09,756
[singing softly]

685
00:48:16,458 --> 00:48:18,156
[Paul] But you'll get no
credit here,

686
00:48:18,243 --> 00:48:19,984
and no support from me.

687
00:48:20,071 --> 00:48:22,290
You'll be doing this on your
own.

688
00:48:22,377 --> 00:48:24,814
[Ethan] Oh, so this is
about my consciousness work.

689
00:48:24,902 --> 00:48:25,424
Not yours.

690
00:48:27,165 --> 00:48:29,341
Everything generated here
belongs to the university.

691
00:48:29,428 --> 00:48:30,385
[Ethan] You mean you?

692
00:48:30,472 --> 00:48:31,952
That's how this works.

693
00:48:35,434 --> 00:48:39,177
Every thought, every half-baked
idea inside your head

694
00:48:39,264 --> 00:48:40,830
starts with me.

695
00:48:45,661 --> 00:48:48,360
[keys clicking]

696
00:49:05,638 --> 00:49:08,206
[whimpering]

697
00:49:08,293 --> 00:49:11,774
They asked about your work
habits, I told the truth.

698
00:49:11,861 --> 00:49:13,428
Stop with the melodrama.

699
00:49:13,515 --> 00:49:15,648
I don't have time for
it, I don't have time.

700
00:49:16,997 --> 00:49:20,740
- [distorted singing]
- Blow out your candles.

701
00:49:20,827 --> 00:49:22,089
Paul!

702
00:49:22,176 --> 00:49:24,048
Can one of you just find Paul?

703
00:49:29,140 --> 00:49:31,490
[rumbling]

704
00:49:35,973 --> 00:49:38,018
[grunts]

705
00:49:42,675 --> 00:49:43,502
Alli?

706
00:49:48,028 --> 00:49:48,942
Alli!

707
00:49:49,029 --> 00:49:51,379
[coughing]

708
00:49:54,687 --> 00:49:57,385
Ethan, how are the headaches?

709
00:49:58,343 --> 00:50:00,345
They're worse for me, too.

710
00:50:00,432 --> 00:50:02,434
The highest functioning ones
are...

711
00:50:11,138 --> 00:50:12,705
[door closes]

712
00:50:12,792 --> 00:50:14,663
[Alli] Can I talk to you for a
sec?

713
00:50:14,750 --> 00:50:17,275
- You should get going.
- I know, but

714
00:50:17,362 --> 00:50:19,842
I need to confirm something.

715
00:50:25,544 --> 00:50:28,068
[whispering]

716
00:50:38,513 --> 00:50:41,081
[door closes]

717
00:50:45,216 --> 00:50:47,522
Ethan, how are the headaches?

718
00:50:48,784 --> 00:50:50,047
They're worse for me, too.

719
00:50:51,874 --> 00:50:54,529
The highest functioning
ones are burning out first.

720
00:50:54,616 --> 00:50:57,097
I have maybe two hours left.

721
00:50:58,316 --> 00:50:58,925
Creative, three.

722
00:51:00,883 --> 00:51:04,148
Then probably another six hours
for you and section eight.

723
00:51:04,235 --> 00:51:04,583
And so on.

724
00:51:06,541 --> 00:51:09,631
I'd say we have less than 24
hours until full brain death.

725
00:51:10,545 --> 00:51:11,938
So I need you to listen,

726
00:51:13,592 --> 00:51:15,768
because I don't have much
more time to help you.

727
00:51:17,900 --> 00:51:19,772
Alli said you remember the
notebook.

728
00:51:20,947 --> 00:51:23,732
This equation is not the
solution we thought it was.

729
00:51:23,819 --> 00:51:26,822
The equation we need
to do the reintegration

730
00:51:26,909 --> 00:51:29,912
is from the same proof,
and I'm working on it.

731
00:51:29,999 --> 00:51:31,610
But in case I run out of time,

732
00:51:31,697 --> 00:51:33,307
you and Alli will have to figure
it out.

733
00:51:34,569 --> 00:51:36,745
By the way, I figured
out what was going on

734
00:51:36,832 --> 00:51:37,920
with those blackouts.

735
00:51:39,748 --> 00:51:42,795
Seems we were trying to
communicate with ourselves,

736
00:51:42,882 --> 00:51:45,537

send ourself this notebook.

[whimsical music]

738
00:51:47,756 --> 00:51:49,062
It's not my place to opine on
why,

739
00:51:50,890 --> 00:51:54,763
but I think we saw what a
sad sack of shit we'd become,

740
00:51:55,895 --> 00:51:59,899
and decided with total
conviction that the solution

741
00:51:59,986 --> 00:52:02,119
was to fracture and reset our
mind.

742
00:52:05,383 --> 00:52:08,125
These were clearly moments
of heightened brain activity.

743
00:52:09,300 --> 00:52:10,649
It's like psychedelics.

If I had the answers
during these blackouts,

747
00:52:18,222 --> 00:52:20,311
you think I'd wanna do this to
myself?

748
00:52:21,268 --> 00:52:22,661

doing.

home,

Any, any troubles?

1104
01:21:26,446 --> 01:21:28,318
No, I figured it out.

1105
01:21:28,405 --> 01:21:30,886
Good, so we're almost all set,
then.

1106
01:21:32,409 --> 01:21:35,978
Yeah, I just gotta rig the
coolant, and then the equation.

We'll do the reintegration next
hour.

Just give me the equation.

Nice work.

1155
01:25:58,588 --> 01:26:00,981
Ethan, don't do this.

1156
01:26:01,068 --> 01:26:02,679
I know you're still in there.

1157

Have you considered the
possibility this is me?

Alli, I'm the real Ethan.

1159

It's confirmation bias.

If you knock on my door
a few minutes earlier,

1161
01:26:10,339 --> 01:26:11,992
you'd be helping me.

Ethan, if you do this,

[applauding]

1189
01:29:15,088 --> 01:29:16,916
[Alli] Thank you, Dean Myers.

1190
01:29:17,003 --> 01:29:19,702
You're all familiar with Dr.
Ethan Kochar and his father,

1191
01:29:19,789 --> 01:29:21,486
and the work they pioneered.

1192
01:29:21,573 --> 01:29:24,141
It provided the basis for
our design of the R-11,

1193
01:29:24,228 --> 01:29:26,099
which the university has
graciously allowed me

1194
01:29:26,186 --> 01:29:28,145
to take the lead on.

1195
01:29:28,232 --> 01:29:32,671
Dr. Kochar's R9-X allowed
us to map the neuropathways

1196
01:29:32,758 --> 01:29:34,934
of memories and extract them.

1197
01:29:35,021 --> 01:29:37,067
Similarly, the R-10 allowed us

1198
01:29:37,154 --> 01:29:39,722
to map the neuropathways of
consciousness,

1199
01:29:39,809 --> 01:29:42,899
giving insight into the
architecture of behavior.

1200
01:29:44,248 --> 01:29:49,296
What we saw was both
surprising, and yet logical.

1201
01:29:50,559 --> 01:29:53,170
Our personalities share
considerable real estate

1202
01:29:53,257 --> 01:29:54,519
with our memories.

1203
01:29:56,391 --> 01:29:58,697
But we still have a choice to
make.

1204
01:29:59,872 --> 01:30:02,353
We get to decide how we
interpret our experiences

1205
01:30:02,440 --> 01:30:05,008
and how they effect who we are.

1206
01:30:05,095 --> 01:30:05,965
[Malcolm] Ethan!

1207
01:30:08,228 --> 01:30:09,273

I know, I'm on my way now.

1210

You've even got her doing
your lectures for you.

1211
01:30:22,112 --> 01:30:23,983
Well, it's her project now.

1212
01:30:34,124 --> 01:30:36,213
Don't wanna miss too much.

1213
01:30:36,300 --> 01:30:38,389
All right, Malcolm, nice to
see you.

1214
01:30:39,521 --> 01:30:41,610
[Alli] We're not merely
computers,

1215

our senses take in.

1216
01:30:43,873 --> 01:30:46,441
Nor are we adding machines
marking ones and zeroes

1217
01:30:46,528 --> 01:30:47,964
on a cerebral ledger.

1218
01:30:50,401 --> 01:30:51,924
There's something else.

1219
01:30:55,580 --> 01:31:00,063
Traits that mark us,
intelligence, anger, love,

1220
01:31:00,150 --> 01:31:03,762
do not define us.

But when they coexist in

something emerges.

immaterial.
