1
00:00:19,630 --> 00:00:20,463
Dani?

2
00:02:52,518 --> 00:02:53,351
Claire.

3
00:08:54,279 --> 00:08:55,112
Help!

4
00:08:57,001 --> 00:08:57,834
Anybody!

5
00:09:33,056 --> 00:09:36,146
Tonight's top story,
the notorious serial killer,...

6
00:09:36,147 --> 00:09:39,215
...Edward Wojowski's gruesome
reign of terror over the city...

7
00:09:39,216 --> 00:09:42,323
...of Pittsburgh came to an end
today with the escape...

8
00:09:42,324 --> 00:09:45,682
...of one of his would-be victims
from an abandoned steel mill.

9
00:09:45,683 --> 00:09:48,426
Unconfirmed police reports
indicate that the killer,...

10
00:09:48,427 --> 00:09:51,365
...popularly referred to
as The Survivalist,...

11
00:09:51,366 --> 00:09:54,602
...was killed by an unidentified
female when she escaped,...

12
00:09:54,603 --> 00:09:58,603
...despite severe injuries,
to South Side Hospital.

13
00:10:15,518 --> 00:10:17,693
How are you feeling?

14
00:10:17,694 --> 00:10:18,527
Okay.

15
00:10:19,406 --> 00:10:22,885
Well, I've looked at your
x-rays and the CT scan.

16
00:10:22,886 --> 00:10:25,085
There is some ligament
damage to your knee.

17
00:10:25,086 --> 00:10:27,976
It's gonna require therapy
and a bit of time...

18
00:10:27,977 --> 00:10:29,560
...to completely mend.

19
00:10:30,897 --> 00:10:35,397
Your eye on the other hand,
well, there's been some damage.

20
00:10:35,398 --> 00:10:37,496
Best thing we can do is
leave this bandage on...

21
00:10:37,497 --> 00:10:40,733
...for the next week,
let nature run its course.

22
00:10:40,734 --> 00:10:43,397
I'm afraid you're not gonna
get all of your vision back,...

23
00:10:43,398 --> 00:10:46,315
...but there will be some improvement.

24
00:10:48,344 --> 00:10:49,177
Thanks.

25
00:10:52,988 --> 00:10:55,003
My most pressing concern right now,...

26
00:10:55,004 --> 00:10:56,794
...is for your state
of mental well-being.

27
00:10:56,795 --> 00:10:58,885
A traumatic event like this,...

28
00:10:58,886 --> 00:11:02,553
...it's gonna be difficult
for you to get over.

29
00:11:04,297 --> 00:11:06,227
This is the number of a friend of mine.

30
00:11:06,228 --> 00:11:09,595
He can help you get through this.

31
00:11:09,596 --> 00:11:10,835
Give him a call.

32
00:11:10,836 --> 00:11:12,336
He's a good guy.

33
00:11:12,337 --> 00:11:16,087
But like your eye, it's
gonna take some time.

34
00:11:26,387 --> 00:11:27,804
No, no, no, no.

35
00:11:29,755 --> 00:11:30,588
No!

36
00:11:31,645 --> 00:11:33,066
No, no, no.

37
00:11:33,067 --> 00:11:34,317
No, no, no, no.

38
00:11:35,645 --> 00:11:39,193
No, no no no no, no, no no no no.

39
00:11:39,194 --> 00:11:40,453
No.

40
00:12:12,152 --> 00:12:13,485
This is, uh--

41
00:12:15,103 --> 00:12:16,436
Monday, May 5th.

42
00:12:17,431 --> 00:12:20,433
This is the interview
with Penelope Warren,...

43
00:12:20,434 --> 00:12:23,334
...by detective Jake Mosser,...

44
00:12:23,335 --> 00:12:27,335
...relating to the events
of April 29th to May 2nd.

45
00:12:30,274 --> 00:12:33,190
Can I get you a water, coffee,...

46
00:12:33,191 --> 00:12:35,684
...something like that, Miss Warren?

47
00:12:35,685 --> 00:12:38,102
No, no I'm fine, thank you.

48
00:12:39,887 --> 00:12:44,100
I'll try to make this as
brief as possible, Penelope.

49
00:12:44,101 --> 00:12:45,601
Um, well, Penny.

50
00:12:47,101 --> 00:12:49,684
You can just call me Penny,
I mean, everyone does.

51
00:12:49,685 --> 00:12:50,518
Well--

52
00:12:52,478 --> 00:12:53,561
Everyone did.

53
00:12:55,143 --> 00:12:56,900
Okay then.

54
00:12:56,901 --> 00:12:57,901
Penny, uh--

55
00:12:59,062 --> 00:13:03,229
I'd like you to take a look
at this photo, if you will.

56
00:13:08,794 --> 00:13:11,544
Can you tell me, uh, who that is?

57
00:13:17,533 --> 00:13:18,366
Um--

58
00:13:21,314 --> 00:13:23,897
Yeah, that's him, that's the--

59
00:13:25,445 --> 00:13:27,862
That's the man that murdered,...

60
00:13:28,930 --> 00:13:31,097
...and killed all my friends,...

61
00:13:32,943 --> 00:13:35,110
...and that killed my fiance.

62
00:13:37,333 --> 00:13:39,666
The man I killed with an ax.

63
00:13:45,794 --> 00:13:50,209
Let the record show that
Miss Warren has identified...

64
00:13:50,210 --> 00:13:54,652
...Edward Wojowski, also
known as The Survivalist,...

65
00:13:54,653 --> 00:13:56,070
...as her assailant.

66
00:14:02,522 --> 00:14:03,439
Well, uh--

67
00:14:05,103 --> 00:14:09,582
I think that's all we're gonna
need from you, uh, today.

68
00:14:09,583 --> 00:14:13,750
There'll be a hearing regarding
the murder of Wojowski.

69
00:14:15,653 --> 00:14:19,852
I don't expect that
you'll be needed for that.

70
00:14:19,853 --> 00:14:20,686
Uh--

71
00:14:21,754 --> 00:14:23,801
Given the circumstances,...

72
00:14:23,802 --> 00:14:27,650
...I don't believe that
anyone would think that you...

73
00:14:27,651 --> 00:14:31,818
...acted, uh, in any way other
than your own self-defense.

74
00:14:34,090 --> 00:14:36,507
So I hope that now you can...

75
00:14:39,932 --> 00:14:44,099
...start to get past this and,
uh, move on with your life.

76
00:14:46,371 --> 00:14:47,204
How?

77
00:14:49,023 --> 00:14:50,690
I beg your pardon?

78
00:14:53,722 --> 00:14:57,889
How exactly am I supposed
to move on with my life?

79
00:14:59,092 --> 00:15:01,073
All my friends are dead.

80
00:15:01,074 --> 00:15:02,574
My fiance is dead.

81
00:15:03,594 --> 00:15:06,094
They were butchered by that--

82
00:15:09,010 --> 00:15:10,010
That maniac.

83
00:15:14,611 --> 00:15:17,194
Penny, uh, I look at you and,...

84
00:15:18,482 --> 00:15:19,565
...I can see it.

85
00:15:20,522 --> 00:15:22,022
You're a survivor.

86
00:15:28,530 --> 00:15:29,863
Apparently so.

87
00:16:30,992 --> 00:16:31,825
No, no.

88
00:16:33,522 --> 00:16:34,355
No!

89
00:16:35,402 --> 00:16:36,903
No, no, no.

90
00:16:36,904 --> 00:16:38,487
No, no, no, no, no.

91
00:16:44,621 --> 00:16:46,204
No no, no no no no.

92
00:16:47,373 --> 00:16:48,591
No.

93
00:17:15,001 --> 00:17:17,501
Tell me what you see, Penny.

94
00:17:20,082 --> 00:17:20,915
He's--

95
00:17:21,891 --> 00:17:22,724
He's tall.

96
00:17:25,642 --> 00:17:26,892
And he's angry.

97
00:17:28,213 --> 00:17:29,963
It's hard, I can't--

98
00:17:32,933 --> 00:17:33,766
I--

99
00:17:34,693 --> 00:17:38,526
There's so much blood
in my eyes, I can't see.

100
00:17:42,250 --> 00:17:43,500
He has a knife.

101
00:17:47,973 --> 00:17:48,806
I--

102
00:17:49,973 --> 00:17:52,306
I think he knows where I am.

103
00:17:54,573 --> 00:17:56,823
What, what are you doing?

104
00:18:01,253 --> 00:18:02,086
Nothing.

105
00:18:03,733 --> 00:18:05,900
I, I'm too scared to move.

106
00:18:12,059 --> 00:18:13,642
It's, it's so cold.

107
00:18:17,090 --> 00:18:19,173
I'm so hungry and my eye,...

108
00:18:21,191 --> 00:18:22,858
...my eye hurts so bad.

109
00:18:25,453 --> 00:18:27,953
You're vulnerable right now.

110
00:18:31,093 --> 00:18:32,510
Okay, let's talk.

111
00:18:34,671 --> 00:18:37,132
The effects of an experience
like this continues to...

112
00:18:37,133 --> 00:18:40,561
...undermine your own confidence, Penny.

113
00:18:40,562 --> 00:18:43,540
The violation you sustained
at the hands of Mr. Wojowski,...

114
00:18:43,541 --> 00:18:46,748
...well, this is something that
we'll surely be dealing with...

115
00:18:46,749 --> 00:18:48,961
...for quite some time.

116
00:18:48,962 --> 00:18:52,180
But in the end, we'll be
able to overcome it together.

117
00:18:52,181 --> 00:18:53,070
All right?

118
00:18:54,391 --> 00:18:56,688
Whatever you say.

119
00:18:56,689 --> 00:18:58,058
Okay, good.

120
00:18:58,059 --> 00:19:01,201
Now will I be able to
see you again, Friday?

121
00:19:01,202 --> 00:19:02,489
Okay.

122
00:19:02,490 --> 00:19:03,849
Thanks, doctor.

123
00:19:03,850 --> 00:19:04,683
Okay.

124
00:20:18,787 --> 00:20:19,620
No!

125
00:20:23,254 --> 00:20:24,087
No!

126
00:22:41,338 --> 00:22:43,718
Are we having more nightmares?

127
00:22:43,719 --> 00:22:44,636
Oh, yeah.

128
00:22:47,538 --> 00:22:48,455
You know--

129
00:22:49,447 --> 00:22:52,497
I thought they'd be
getting better by now.

130
00:22:52,498 --> 00:22:55,454
Well, these things take time.

131
00:22:55,455 --> 00:22:59,246
I'll give you a prescription,
something to help you sleep.

132
00:22:59,247 --> 00:23:00,497
Yeah, thanks.

133
00:23:01,578 --> 00:23:03,518
I mean, I think the hardest
thing that you're facing...

134
00:23:03,519 --> 00:23:05,926
...right now is how to
reinsert yourself...

135
00:23:05,927 --> 00:23:08,094
...into your old life, Penny.

136
00:23:11,839 --> 00:23:14,589
My old life is gone, Dr. Lentz.

137
00:23:16,029 --> 00:23:18,468
I mean, there must be something, surely.

138
00:23:18,469 --> 00:23:21,348
Have you tried
going back to work, uh,...

139
00:23:21,349 --> 00:23:24,399
...what is it exactly
that you do again?

140
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:25,232

An entertainer.

148
00:23:41,304 --> 00:23:44,874
Well maybe that's
the medicine that we need.

149
00:23:44,875 --> 00:23:47,530
We're told today, the remains
of Edward Wojowski...

150
00:23:47,531 --> 00:23:50,343
...were laid to rest in
an unmarked grave.

151
00:23:50,344 --> 00:23:52,663
Potters Field will be
the final resting place...

152
00:23:52,664 --> 00:23:55,693
...of the man who terrorized
the one and a half million...

153
00:23:55,694 --> 00:23:58,994
...residents of the
greater Pittsburgh area.

154
00:23:58,995 --> 00:24:01,411
But the question on the minds
of the relieved people...

155
00:24:01,412 --> 00:24:04,362
...of this city is, who is
this woman who stopped...

156
00:24:04,363 --> 00:24:07,201
...the bloody trail of death
and suffering...

157
00:24:07,202 --> 00:24:09,663
...that The Survivalist blazed?

158
00:24:09,664 --> 00:24:12,651
Sources say the woman
is in her mid-20s,...

159
00:24:12,652 --> 00:24:14,623
...a local model and dancer.

160
00:24:14,624 --> 00:24:17,082
Little more is known about this
woman some Pittsburghers...

161
00:24:17,083 --> 00:24:20,282
...are calling a hero, but
rest assured, WPXX...

162
00:24:20,283 --> 00:24:22,562

So tell me what you see.

192
00:27:26,547 --> 00:27:27,380
I--

193
00:27:28,312 --> 00:27:29,979
I can see the light.

194
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,833
I can see it a little.

195
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:34,863
But--

196
00:27:34,864 --> 00:27:35,697
Okay.

197
00:27:36,792 --> 00:27:37,879
I'm sorry, Penny,...

198
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:42,252
...there was just too much damage
to the cornea and your iris.

199
00:27:42,253 --> 00:27:44,003
So then, that's it?

200
00:27:44,991 --> 00:27:46,321
Well, look at this way,...

201
00:27:46,322 --> 00:27:48,332
...you still have excellent
vision in your other eye.

202
00:27:48,333 --> 00:27:52,240
It's important to look at positive
things at a time like this.

203
00:27:52,241 --> 00:27:53,074
Yeah.

204
00:27:53,922 --> 00:27:54,755
Positive.

205
00:27:56,312 --> 00:28:00,383
Like, we can get rid of that crutch
and give you a knee brace.

206
00:28:00,384 --> 00:28:01,217
Great!

207
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:03,033
Thank you.

208
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:07,932
So how's it going with Dr. Lentz?

209
00:28:07,933 --> 00:28:11,702
Well, you know.

210
00:28:11,703 --> 00:28:12,620
It's going.

211
00:29:36,479 --> 00:29:37,518
Penny Warren?

212
00:29:37,519 --> 00:29:38,351
Yeah?

213
00:29:38,352 --> 00:29:41,097
Hi, I'm Alicia Hayes, WPXX News?

214
00:29:41,098 --> 00:29:43,617
I'm not interested
in giving any interviews.

215
00:29:43,618 --> 00:29:45,096
Look, I was just wondering if we could--

216
00:29:45,097 --> 00:29:47,256
No, no, no, I'm not.

217
00:29:47,257 --> 00:29:50,590
No, no interviews, just watch your hand.

218
00:29:53,778 --> 00:29:56,467
I'm just gonna leave my card
here for you, Penny!

219
00:29:56,468 --> 00:29:58,609
Just in case you want
someone to talk to!

220
00:29:58,610 --> 00:30:01,187
Lady, I have enough people...

221
00:30:01,188 --> 00:30:03,855
...that I have to talk to as it is.

222
00:30:15,179 --> 00:30:17,168
I can't drive.

223
00:30:17,169 --> 00:30:18,252
I can't work.

224
00:30:19,179 --> 00:30:22,069
I can't, I can't even make a sandwich.

225
00:30:22,070 --> 00:30:22,903
Fuck.

226
00:30:23,877 --> 00:30:25,789
I don't have enough money
to pay for physical therapy...

227
00:30:25,790 --> 00:30:26,707
...for my leg.

228
00:30:28,198 --> 00:30:32,365
I don't even have enough
money to pay you, doctor.

229
00:30:33,917 --> 00:30:37,725
Edward Wojowski squatted
in the steel mill,...

230
00:30:37,726 --> 00:30:40,269
...and you know, he had no family.

231
00:30:40,270 --> 00:30:44,437
It's not like I can sue his
estate or anything, can I?

232
00:30:46,929 --> 00:30:51,096
There's just, everything
is just now, it's just me.

233
00:30:52,179 --> 00:30:53,512
I'm just, alone.

234
00:30:54,539 --> 00:30:55,789
You're angry.

235
00:31:00,809 --> 00:31:03,048
Well I'm glad all that money
towards your college degree...

236
00:31:03,049 --> 00:31:07,648
...didn't go wasted, doc, 'cause
you're fuckin' right I'm angry.

237
00:31:07,649 --> 00:31:10,469
That bastard took everything from me!

238
00:31:10,470 --> 00:31:12,053
He took everything!

239
00:31:13,299 --> 00:31:16,408
He took my vision, he took my leg.

240
00:31:16,409 --> 00:31:17,576
He took the--

241
00:31:18,470 --> 00:31:22,018
He took the only man that I ever loved!

242
00:31:26,566 --> 00:31:28,086
God.

243
00:31:28,087 --> 00:31:30,858
And you know what,
doctor, you know what?

244
00:31:30,859 --> 00:31:33,586
Why, why did he leave me?

245
00:31:33,587 --> 00:31:35,586
Why didn't he kill me?

246
00:31:35,587 --> 00:31:38,935
'Cause this life wasn't meant for me.

247
00:31:38,936 --> 00:31:41,797
I wasn't supposed to deal with
all this shit 'cause my life...

248
00:31:41,798 --> 00:31:43,215
...wasn't this shit.

249
00:31:46,259 --> 00:31:47,092
Fuck.

250
00:31:49,419 --> 00:31:52,742
You should feel free to let it out.

251
00:31:52,743 --> 00:31:54,493
This is a safe place.

252
00:31:56,336 --> 00:31:57,753
Safe? Yeah, hm.

253
00:31:59,008 --> 00:32:01,727
I thought my house was
a safe place, doctor.

254
00:32:01,728 --> 00:32:03,887
I thought the woods was a safe place.

255
00:32:03,888 --> 00:32:04,720
You know what?

256
00:32:04,721 --> 00:32:07,356
Safety, there is no such thing
as a safe place, I mean,...

257
00:32:07,357 --> 00:32:10,524
...safety is just,
it's just an illusion.

258
00:32:12,005 --> 00:32:14,764
What I'm gonna do is prescribe
you something a little bit...

259
00:32:14,765 --> 00:32:18,582
...more powerful,
a more powerful dosage.

260
00:32:18,583 --> 00:32:21,832
You need time, you need
time to heal yourself,...

261
00:32:21,833 --> 00:32:23,862
...to heal your psyche.

262
00:32:23,863 --> 00:32:24,696
Yeah.

263
00:32:31,256 --> 00:32:32,089
Thanks.

264
00:32:44,939 --> 00:32:45,772
Shit!

265
00:33:30,983 --> 00:33:32,759
Hello, Penny.

266
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:36,230
Oh god, lady, do you not get the hint?

267
00:33:36,231 --> 00:33:39,005
Well if I did, then I wouldn't be very
good at my job now, would I?

268
00:33:39,999 --> 00:33:40,920
Hey, I just wanted--

269
00:33:40,921 --> 00:33:42,349
Jesus.

270
00:33:42,350 --> 00:33:44,559
Don't fuckin' touch me.

271
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:47,600
Now you listen to me and you listen
to me real fuckin' good,...

272
00:33:47,601 --> 00:33:52,422
...news lady, now is the time
for you to start backing off.

273
00:33:52,423 --> 00:33:53,256
Okay?

274
00:33:55,350 --> 00:33:57,350
But people wanna know!

275
00:33:58,239 --> 00:33:59,222
What?

276
00:33:59,223 --> 00:34:01,480
What do they exactly wanna know?

277
00:34:01,481 --> 00:34:03,771
Do they wanna know how it feels
to have everybody that you...

278
00:34:03,772 --> 00:34:05,800
...care about butchered?

279
00:34:05,801 --> 00:34:08,931
Or maybe they wanna know how
it feels to have to go through...

280
00:34:08,932 --> 00:34:13,099
...the rest of your life
looking like a fuckin' freak.

281
00:34:15,001 --> 00:34:18,334
I planted an ax in a guy's skull, bitch.

282
00:34:20,063 --> 00:34:23,062
So maybe that should be
a hint to you,...

283
00:34:23,063 --> 00:34:25,313
...to leave me the fuck alone.

284
00:34:36,343 --> 00:34:39,676
I planted an ax in a guy's skull, bitch.

285
00:35:09,707 --> 00:35:11,124
No, no no, no no.

286
00:36:18,530 --> 00:36:20,197
So what do we got?

287
00:36:21,034 --> 00:36:23,663
Look familiar?

288
00:36:23,664 --> 00:36:25,252
Did you check her back?

289
00:36:25,253 --> 00:36:28,601
Um, not yet, I wanted you
to see her before I moved her.

290
00:36:28,602 --> 00:36:31,292
No scrapes on the back
of her ankles or her legs...

291
00:36:31,293 --> 00:36:32,960
...that I can see here.

292
00:36:35,450 --> 00:36:37,063
What do you think?

293
00:36:37,064 --> 00:36:39,343
Did you check to see if there's
any defensive wounds...

294
00:36:39,344 --> 00:36:41,521
...on the arms or hands?

295
00:36:41,522 --> 00:36:42,913
Nothin' even under her nails.

296
00:36:42,914 --> 00:36:44,383
I know, I can't figure it out.

297
00:36:44,384 --> 00:36:46,012
She let somebody do this?

298
00:36:46,013 --> 00:36:48,481
It's happened the same way.

299
00:36:48,482 --> 00:36:50,193
I mean, look at the body positioning.

300
00:36:50,194 --> 00:36:53,490
Everything is the same as the last time.

301
00:36:53,491 --> 00:36:57,129
And my question is, if
that's not Wojowski,...

302
00:36:57,130 --> 00:37:00,713
...then who the hell are
we dealing with here?

303
00:37:06,680 --> 00:37:07,513
Coming.

304
00:37:16,670 --> 00:37:18,706
Oh, Detective--

305
00:37:18,707 --> 00:37:19,850
Mosser.

306
00:37:19,851 --> 00:37:21,184
Mosser, sorry.

307
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:24,297
Um.

308
00:37:24,298 --> 00:37:26,199
Come in, come in.

309
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:27,033
Thanks.

310
00:37:28,258 --> 00:37:29,091
Um.

311
00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:31,537
I was just, um--

312
00:37:33,415 --> 00:37:35,683
Oh, do you want some
coffee or something?

313
00:37:35,684 --> 00:37:38,995
Sure, that'd be great, thanks.

314
00:37:38,996 --> 00:37:41,663
Just give me a second.

315
00:37:48,481 --> 00:37:50,491
This is a nice place.

316
00:37:50,492 --> 00:37:53,159
So uh, how are you doing, Penny?

317
00:37:55,783 --> 00:37:56,862
The truth?

318
00:37:56,863 --> 00:37:58,283
Of course.

319
00:38:00,580 --> 00:38:02,997
Pretty fuckin' bad.

320
00:38:04,261 --> 00:38:06,259
Well I'm sorry.

321
00:38:06,260 --> 00:38:08,592
It's a hell of a thing.

322
00:38:08,593 --> 00:38:12,760
You took a man's life, right
or wrong, it changes you.

323
00:38:15,251 --> 00:38:16,668
It changes you.

324
00:38:18,503 --> 00:38:21,811
My first year as a detective.

325
00:38:21,812 --> 00:38:23,562
Domestic disturbance.

326
00:38:24,553 --> 00:38:28,472
You know, more police officers
are injured on domestics...

327
00:38:28,473 --> 00:38:30,806
...than any other type of call?

328
00:38:32,073 --> 00:38:34,156
No, I didn't know that.

329
00:38:35,131 --> 00:38:36,291
What happened?

330
00:38:36,292 --> 00:38:37,125
Well--

331
00:38:38,331 --> 00:38:40,930
That's not important anymore.

332
00:38:40,931 --> 00:38:43,763
People were in danger,
I had a choice to make...

333
00:38:43,764 --> 00:38:47,043
...and I made it, simple as that.

334
00:38:47,044 --> 00:38:48,819
I'd do it again if I had to.

335
00:38:48,820 --> 00:38:51,320
Well, I think I'd do it again.

336
00:38:53,644 --> 00:38:54,561
So, um--

337
00:38:56,153 --> 00:38:58,653
Oh, I'm sorry, did you come--

338
00:38:59,532 --> 00:39:02,770
Did you need anything from me?

339
00:39:02,771 --> 00:39:06,662
I didn't know if I forgot
to call you or, did you--

340
00:39:06,663 --> 00:39:09,330
Penny, we found a girl's body,...

341
00:39:10,684 --> 00:39:14,101
...up in the woods
on the hill this morning.

342
00:39:15,313 --> 00:39:16,542
By the reservoir.

343
00:39:16,543 --> 00:39:19,543
We haven't, uh, IDed the girl yet,...

344
00:39:20,463 --> 00:39:24,630
...but she was stripped naked
and killed with a survival knife.

345
00:39:25,903 --> 00:39:29,382
Just, um--

346
00:39:29,383 --> 00:39:30,659
Just like--

347
00:39:30,660 --> 00:39:35,219
Yeah, the trouble is, what's
left of Edward Wojowski is...

348
00:39:35,220 --> 00:39:38,112
...in an urn in the Potters Field.

349
00:39:38,113 --> 00:39:40,363
I know, I saw him cremated.

350
00:39:42,644 --> 00:39:45,144
So what are you saying then?

351
00:39:46,063 --> 00:39:48,019
We're just not sure.

352
00:39:48,020 --> 00:39:51,862
There's been a lot of media
coverage of these events.

353
00:39:51,863 --> 00:39:54,030
Sometimes we get copycats.

354
00:39:55,661 --> 00:39:58,494
People looking to grab a headline.

355
00:39:59,820 --> 00:40:03,650
The other possibility
is that Edward Wojowski...

356
00:40:03,651 --> 00:40:05,484
...was not working alone.

357
00:40:07,124 --> 00:40:11,460
That he had some kind of
a partner on the outside.

358
00:40:11,461 --> 00:40:13,723
We just don't know.

359
00:40:18,143 --> 00:40:19,560
Well there's--

360
00:40:20,673 --> 00:40:21,840
There's, um--

361
00:40:24,251 --> 00:40:26,584
I'm sorry, detective, I'm--

362
00:40:28,953 --> 00:40:31,870
I'm not, I'm not feeling that well.

363
00:40:43,458 --> 00:40:44,475
Penny.

364
00:40:44,476 --> 00:40:46,559
Penny, are you all right?

365
00:40:48,676 --> 00:40:49,509
Yeah.

366
00:40:51,553 --> 00:40:54,795
I'm fine, detective, I'm
just not feeling that good.

367
00:40:54,796 --> 00:40:57,806
Can I call someone for you?

368
00:40:57,807 --> 00:40:59,046
There's no one left to call.

369
00:40:59,047 --> 00:41:00,047
I'm sorry?

370
00:41:00,953 --> 00:41:01,786
Um.

371
00:41:02,897 --> 00:41:06,176
Nothing, can you just
make sure that the door...

372
00:41:06,177 --> 00:41:08,344
...is locked on your way out?

373
00:41:10,617 --> 00:41:11,450
I'll--

374
00:41:12,796 --> 00:41:15,874
Can I call and check on your tomorrow?

375
00:41:15,875 --> 00:41:18,966
I feel bad leaving you like this.

376
00:41:18,967 --> 00:41:20,824
Okay, um, great, thanks.

377
00:41:20,825 --> 00:41:23,575
Yeah, I'll talk to your tomorrow.

378
00:41:26,154 --> 00:41:26,987
I'll--

379
00:41:28,167 --> 00:41:30,084
You, uh, you take care.

380
00:42:04,877 --> 00:42:05,710
Shit.

381
00:42:10,488 --> 00:42:12,606
The city of Pittsburgh is
breathing a sigh of relief...

382
00:42:12,607 --> 00:42:15,966
...this week knowing that one of
its most dangerous denizens,...

383
00:42:15,967 --> 00:42:19,348
...Edward "The Survivalist"
Wojowski, is dead.

384
00:42:19,349 --> 00:42:22,295
This is the steel mill where
Wojowski ate, slept...

385
00:42:22,296 --> 00:42:24,097
...and tortured his victims.

386
00:42:24,098 --> 00:42:26,975
Now police are not letting any
reporters into the building,...

387
00:42:26,976 --> 00:42:30,415
...but here at WPXX, we've
gained exclusive information...

388
00:42:30,416 --> 00:42:33,096
...regarding the woman who
some are referring to as...

389
00:42:33,097 --> 00:42:35,028
...the one who got away.

390
00:42:35,029 --> 00:42:36,697
This is the home of Penny Warren,...

391
00:42:36,698 --> 00:42:39,206
...who would have been
The Survivalist's ninth victim,...

392
00:42:39,207 --> 00:42:41,199
...before her daring escape
last Tuesday...

393
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:44,215
...during which she managed
to kill her captor with an ax.

394
00:42:44,216 --> 00:42:46,415
I attempted to interview
Miss Warren the other day,...

395
00:42:46,416 --> 00:42:49,737
...but found her unwilling to
talk about the recent events.

396
00:42:49,738 --> 00:42:52,535
Evidently, this is a woman
who is still dealing...

397
00:42:52,536 --> 00:42:54,817
...with the trauma from recent events.

398
00:42:54,818 --> 00:42:58,927
And now, we have unconfirmed
reports that another body...

399
00:42:58,928 --> 00:43:01,937
...has been found in
the woods in Mount Oliver.

400
00:43:01,938 --> 00:43:04,388
It's obvious that this is
a story whose conclusion...

401
00:43:04,389 --> 00:43:06,137
...has yet to be decided.

402
00:43:06,138 --> 00:43:08,999
Until then, we'll be working
to keep you informed.

403
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,000
Alicia Hayes, WPXX News.

404
00:43:54,539 --> 00:43:58,728
You know, I really hate to see you
withdrawn like this, Penny.

405
00:43:59,987 --> 00:44:02,898
I don't know, doctor, I've been--

406
00:44:02,899 --> 00:44:07,088
I think after all I've been
through and, you know,...

407
00:44:07,089 --> 00:44:10,298
...all the killings and stuff,
like, maybe,...

408
00:44:10,299 --> 00:44:12,808
...maybe it changed me, somehow.

409
00:44:12,809 --> 00:44:16,976
Well, you are who you are
and nothing can change that.

410
00:44:17,979 --> 00:44:21,946
I don't know, I've been
having these dreams,...

411
00:44:21,947 --> 00:44:24,030
...like, these awful dreams.

412
00:44:26,059 --> 00:44:28,874
And my temper, I'm just so angry.

413
00:44:28,875 --> 00:44:30,674
Well, well of course you're angry.

414
00:44:30,675 --> 00:44:32,994
I mean, your life has been
turned upside down,...

415
00:44:32,995 --> 00:44:35,837
...and as far as the rest,
your body's adjusting...

416
00:44:35,838 --> 00:44:39,346
...to the medication and you know,
these things take time...

417
00:44:39,347 --> 00:44:41,514
...and we will work them out.

418
00:44:42,619 --> 00:44:46,793
You know, the world has a lot
to offer, and I'm afraid that...

419
00:44:46,794 --> 00:44:49,825
...you're missing out on some
of these things, and uh,...

420
00:44:49,826 --> 00:44:53,217
...despite what you think, you're
a young and attractive woman...

421
00:44:53,218 --> 00:44:56,995
...and uh, I'm sure that there's
something out there for you.

422
00:45:04,567 --> 00:45:06,195
Penny?

423
00:45:10,026 --> 00:45:10,859
Penny?

424
00:52:17,698 --> 00:52:18,884
Hello?

425
00:52:18,885 --> 00:52:21,007
Penny, it's Dr. Lentz.

426
00:52:21,008 --> 00:52:23,447
Uh, you missed your appointment
this morning,...

427
00:52:23,448 --> 00:52:27,155
...and I was wondering if
uh, everything was okay.

428
00:52:27,156 --> 00:52:28,796
I'm a little concerned.

429
00:52:28,797 --> 00:52:31,108
No, doctor.

430
00:52:31,109 --> 00:52:33,609
Everything is most definitely,...

431
00:52:34,568 --> 00:52:35,735
...not all right.

432
00:52:37,088 --> 00:52:40,447
Well, if you feel better about coming
over here to see me,...

433
00:52:40,448 --> 00:52:42,555
...or I can come to see you--

434
00:52:42,556 --> 00:52:43,924
I...

435
00:52:43,925 --> 00:52:46,567
I think it's best if you just--

436
00:52:46,568 --> 00:52:49,127
If you just stay away from me.

437
00:52:49,128 --> 00:52:52,468
Well Penny, I could be there, like,
in around 10 minutes if you want--

438
00:52:52,469 --> 00:52:53,969
Goodbye, doctor.

439
00:55:04,526 --> 00:55:08,359
Penny, you didn't answer
my call last night.

440
00:55:10,214 --> 00:55:12,136
How'd you know I was here, detective?

441
00:55:12,137 --> 00:55:14,067
Please, call me Jake.

442
00:55:14,068 --> 00:55:14,901
Okay.

443
00:55:15,737 --> 00:55:17,685
How'd you know I was here, Jake?

444
00:55:17,686 --> 00:55:20,645
Now, I don't want you to take
this the wrong way.

445
00:55:20,646 --> 00:55:24,405
Oh god, please don't tell me
that you're following me.

446
00:55:24,406 --> 00:55:27,456
Penny, I just wanted to be sure
that you're okay.

447
00:55:27,457 --> 00:55:29,477
After what I've been through?

448
00:55:29,478 --> 00:55:32,067
You don't think I have enough
reasons to be paranoid?

449
00:55:32,068 --> 00:55:32,985
I just--

450
00:55:33,908 --> 00:55:36,735
I did it because I was
worried about you.

451
00:55:36,736 --> 00:55:38,895
Whoever killed these girls--

452
00:55:38,896 --> 00:55:40,547
I gotta go.

453
00:55:40,548 --> 00:55:41,565
Penny, wait.

454
00:55:43,505 --> 00:55:44,337
No, no.

455
00:55:44,338 --> 00:55:45,611
Fuckin' get away from me!

456
00:55:49,942 --> 00:55:51,025
Let go of me!

457
00:55:52,101 --> 00:55:53,844
Why me, Jake?

458
00:55:53,845 --> 00:55:55,460
- Let me give you a ride home.
- No, no!

459
00:55:55,461 --> 00:55:56,628
You answer me.

460
00:55:58,573 --> 00:56:01,764
There is a maniac out
there killing girls,...

461
00:56:01,765 --> 00:56:03,682
...and you're stalking me?

462
00:56:05,061 --> 00:56:08,180
Look at me, I'm
a mangled ex-stripper,...

463
00:56:08,181 --> 00:56:10,393
...with a gimp leg, I can't work.

464
00:56:10,394 --> 00:56:13,092
I gotta ride god-damn public
transportation on top of...

465
00:56:13,093 --> 00:56:15,510
...all of that, I got some major...

466
00:56:17,605 --> 00:56:18,688
...anger issues.

467
00:56:20,464 --> 00:56:23,791
As you, might be able to tell.

468
00:56:23,792 --> 00:56:24,709
So, uh--

469
00:56:26,085 --> 00:56:27,252
Is that a yes?

470
00:56:43,457 --> 00:56:46,600
I know that reporter lady's
been harassing you.

471
00:56:46,601 --> 00:56:49,160
I'll see what I can do
to get her to quit.

472
00:56:49,161 --> 00:56:50,161
Good luck.

473
00:56:52,441 --> 00:56:55,191
She's almost as tenacious as you.

474
00:56:59,212 --> 00:57:04,285
You know, it seems like everybody
is trying to help me, but--

475
00:57:07,292 --> 00:57:08,959
The more they try--

476
00:57:13,812 --> 00:57:14,895
I don't know.

477
00:57:15,889 --> 00:57:19,152
I don't want anything from you, Penny.

478
00:57:19,153 --> 00:57:21,653
I don't have an angle, really.

479
00:57:22,572 --> 00:57:23,405
I just--

480
00:57:25,073 --> 00:57:26,156
Just, just--

481
00:57:27,273 --> 00:57:28,940
Want you to be okay.

482
00:57:37,241 --> 00:57:40,408
There's something that you should see.

483
00:57:55,843 --> 00:57:56,740
What?

484
00:57:56,741 --> 00:57:57,824
This is it.

485
00:58:00,513 --> 00:58:01,722
What's it?

486
00:58:01,723 --> 00:58:04,223
Where they buried his ashes.

487
00:58:15,491 --> 00:58:17,241
It's over now, Penny.

488
00:58:21,062 --> 00:58:26,099
Now you can...
Move on with your life.

489
00:58:58,974 --> 00:59:01,032
I found out the victim's name.

490
00:59:01,033 --> 00:59:02,820
Megan Shamonski.

491
00:59:02,821 --> 00:59:04,820
Turns it she works at The Cricket.

492
00:59:04,821 --> 00:59:08,522
Danced under the name Sunny St. Claire.

493
00:59:08,523 --> 00:59:09,749
Stripper.

494
00:59:09,750 --> 00:59:12,960
Well, it fits The Survivalist's profile.

495
00:59:12,961 --> 00:59:14,824
Yeah, more than you know.

496
00:59:14,825 --> 00:59:17,071
Guess who else worked at The Cricket.

497
00:59:17,072 --> 00:59:18,822
Guess who knew Sunny.

498
00:59:20,523 --> 00:59:21,440
Oh, shit.

499
00:59:22,494 --> 00:59:23,327
Jake.

500
00:59:24,254 --> 00:59:26,162
This Warren girl.

501
00:59:26,163 --> 00:59:28,442
She's caught up in something
that's far from being over...

502
00:59:28,443 --> 00:59:30,360
...and the fact that you're seeing her--

503
00:59:30,361 --> 00:59:33,361
I'm just...
I'm looking out for her, Kim.

504
00:59:33,362 --> 00:59:34,584
She's been through hell.

505
00:59:34,585 --> 00:59:37,668
Everybody she knows is dead, she's--

506
00:59:38,563 --> 00:59:40,831
She's all alone out there.

507
00:59:40,832 --> 00:59:42,722
You understand that, right?

508
00:59:42,723 --> 00:59:43,821
No.

509
00:59:43,822 --> 00:59:44,655
I don't.

510
00:59:45,523 --> 00:59:47,336
And what if she's
more involved in this...

511
00:59:47,337 --> 00:59:49,272
...than either of us know?

512
00:59:49,273 --> 00:59:50,106
What then?

513
00:59:51,235 --> 00:59:55,192
I mean, god, she could be
so messed up in the head...

514
00:59:55,193 --> 00:59:58,983
...she doesn't even know
what she's doing anymore.

515
00:59:58,984 --> 01:00:02,152
And what if she's acting out,...

516
01:00:02,153 --> 01:00:05,194
...everything that happened to her?

517
01:00:05,195 --> 01:00:06,695
Well then, uh--

518
01:00:08,537 --> 01:00:09,704
I guess I'd--

519
01:00:11,795 --> 01:00:14,272
Be the first to know.

520
01:00:14,273 --> 01:00:15,106
Won't I?

521
01:00:22,795 --> 01:00:24,456
Oh hey, how are you doing?

522
01:00:45,432 --> 01:00:47,929
It was nice of your mom...

523
01:00:47,930 --> 01:00:50,500
...to let you borrow her car.

524
01:00:50,501 --> 01:00:54,031
Come on, I get 400 miles
to the gallon in this thing.

525
01:00:54,032 --> 01:00:57,115
I told you, I can't handle tequila.

526
01:01:23,069 --> 01:01:23,902
Fuck.

527
01:01:28,603 --> 01:01:29,682
I'm sorry.

528
01:01:29,683 --> 01:01:30,516
I can't.

529
01:01:34,912 --> 01:01:36,548
It's--

530
01:01:36,549 --> 01:01:38,348
It's all right.

531
01:01:38,349 --> 01:01:40,599
Fuck you, it's all right!

532
01:01:48,112 --> 01:01:49,112
I'm sorry.

533
01:01:51,461 --> 01:01:53,628
Stay away from me, Jake.

534
01:01:54,733 --> 01:01:58,150
Stay away from me
or we'll both be sorry.

535
01:01:59,709 --> 01:02:00,542
I mean it.

536
01:02:02,603 --> 01:02:03,436
Go!

537
01:05:48,293 --> 01:05:50,303
Obvious that Penny Warren
knows more about this...

538
01:05:50,304 --> 01:05:51,794
...than has been revealed.

539
01:05:51,795 --> 01:05:54,565
This reporter wonders why
the police are just allowing...

540
01:05:54,566 --> 01:05:57,901
...a material witness to withhold
such potentially valuable...

541
01:05:57,902 --> 01:05:59,613
...information.

542
01:05:59,614 --> 01:06:02,474
Lieutenant Jake Mosser, the
detective in charge of the...

543
01:06:02,475 --> 01:06:06,441
...ongoing investigation even
contacted me earlier this week...

544
01:06:06,442 --> 01:06:10,609
...and pressured me to abandon
WPXX's reporting on the subject.

545
01:06:12,372 --> 01:06:15,090
More young people are dying, detective.

546
01:06:15,091 --> 01:06:18,573
Instead of covering it up, you
need to bring in this woman...

547
01:06:18,574 --> 01:06:21,663
...and do whatever it takes
to find out what she knows...

548
01:06:21,664 --> 01:06:23,497
...about this new murder.

549
01:06:47,695 --> 01:06:48,646
Penny?

550
01:06:48,647 --> 01:06:50,985
Did you watch the news
tonight, Dr. Lentz?

551
01:06:50,986 --> 01:06:54,166
Yes, I saw it but uh, you really
shouldn't take much stock...

552
01:06:54,167 --> 01:06:57,174
...in what a TV reporter has to say.

553
01:06:57,175 --> 01:06:58,262
You know they're just after--

554
01:06:58,263 --> 01:07:00,180
No, um, I wanna know,...

555
01:07:02,334 --> 01:07:04,825
...do you think there's
a part of me that died...

556
01:07:04,826 --> 01:07:07,185
...along with my friends?

557
01:07:07,186 --> 01:07:08,544
The good part of me.

558
01:07:08,545 --> 01:07:10,933
Penny, you have to realize
that there's a lot of guilt...

559
01:07:10,934 --> 01:07:14,086
...that's associated with when
someone survives an incident...

560
01:07:14,087 --> 01:07:15,675
...where others die.

561
01:07:15,676 --> 01:07:16,926
You know that, don't you?

562
01:07:16,927 --> 01:07:17,844
Bullshit!

563
01:07:18,807 --> 01:07:20,022
Bullshit.

564
01:07:20,023 --> 01:07:23,804
I don't want any of your psychological
PhD opinion crap, okay?

565
01:07:24,836 --> 01:07:26,836
I wanna, I wanna know...

566
01:07:28,066 --> 01:07:31,013
...if someone kills another person,...

567
01:07:31,014 --> 01:07:33,931
...if something inside
of them breaks,...

568
01:07:35,036 --> 01:07:38,302
...that allows them to go and kill...

569
01:07:38,303 --> 01:07:41,094
...someone else again and again.

570
01:07:41,095 --> 01:07:45,102
Penny, are you taking your medication?

571
01:07:45,103 --> 01:07:45,936
Penny?

572
01:07:46,986 --> 01:07:47,933
Penny?

573
01:07:47,934 --> 01:07:49,102
Never mind.

574
01:07:49,103 --> 01:07:51,353
Sorry I called you so late.

575
01:07:54,527 --> 01:07:56,166
Penny?

576
01:07:56,167 --> 01:07:57,000
Penny!

577
01:08:04,253 --> 01:08:06,423
No, Steven, I think it's
a perfectly worthwhile...

578
01:08:06,424 --> 01:08:09,091
...allocation of my time, actually.

579
01:08:21,795 --> 01:08:23,852
Well I think it's a good idea because...

580
01:08:23,853 --> 01:08:25,684
...no one else is going after her,...

581
01:08:25,685 --> 01:08:29,852
...and if I can land this, I can
scoop Channel 4 and WPPG.

582
01:08:38,224 --> 01:08:40,244
Well tell Lou and the others
that they're fucking pussies...

583
01:08:40,245 --> 01:08:41,524
...and they need to strap it on...

584
01:08:41,525 --> 01:08:44,684
...if they wanna play
with the big kids, okay?

585
01:08:44,685 --> 01:08:47,020
Okay.

586
01:08:47,021 --> 01:08:49,463
Well I'm gonna go take a shower.

587
01:08:49,464 --> 01:08:52,463
Yes, Steven, I'll be naked.

588
01:08:52,464 --> 01:08:55,631
That's how people take showers, naked.

589
01:08:57,784 --> 01:08:58,617
Freak.

590
01:09:56,189 --> 01:09:59,856
You?

591
01:11:02,610 --> 01:11:03,966
Penny!

592
01:11:03,967 --> 01:11:06,078
Penny, I know you're there.

593
01:11:06,079 --> 01:11:08,168
Will you just answer on the phone?

594
01:11:08,169 --> 01:11:11,919
Penny, something's happened,
we need to talk.

595
01:11:14,391 --> 01:11:16,401
Penny, Alicia Hayes was
killed last night.

596
01:11:16,402 --> 01:11:17,681
They're gonna make me bring you in...

597
01:11:17,682 --> 01:11:21,099
...if you don't talk to
Detective Hatherton.

598
01:11:32,760 --> 01:11:34,783
Where's Detective Mosser?

599
01:11:34,784 --> 01:11:38,951
Oh, he's not doing this
interview, Miss Warren, I am.

600
01:11:41,082 --> 01:11:42,082
God, okay.

601
01:11:43,453 --> 01:11:46,994
You know what? I really
don't need to see that, I get it.

602
01:11:46,995 --> 01:11:49,852
Look, Penny, you've been
through a hell of an ordeal.

603
01:11:49,853 --> 01:11:51,103
I get it, I do.

604
01:11:52,293 --> 01:11:54,292
But there are people dying out
there and they're people...

605
01:11:54,293 --> 01:11:57,994
...that you have crossed paths
with and you have no alibi...

606
01:11:57,995 --> 01:11:59,434
...for either night.

607
01:11:59,435 --> 01:12:01,274
So what I need from you,...

608
01:12:01,275 --> 01:12:04,172
...is a reason why I shouldn't
think you're completely crazy,...

609
01:12:04,173 --> 01:12:08,173
...and that you're not
responsible for all of this.

610
01:12:24,210 --> 01:12:25,043
Jesus.

611
01:12:41,846 --> 01:12:43,179
All right, well.

612
01:12:44,217 --> 01:12:46,744
So, am I under arrest?

613
01:12:46,745 --> 01:12:50,195
Not technically, no, but you
are a person of interest...

614
01:12:50,196 --> 01:12:53,183
...in an ongoing investigation.

615
01:12:54,097 --> 01:12:56,336
Okay then, well.

616
01:12:56,337 --> 01:12:57,670
I'm out of here.

617
01:13:05,985 --> 01:13:06,985
Hatherton.

618
01:13:40,762 --> 01:13:42,532
You gotta suck it up, sister,...

619
01:13:42,533 --> 01:13:46,366
...or you'll never make it
through all this shit.

620
01:13:48,093 --> 01:13:49,260
Who's there?

621
01:13:50,362 --> 01:13:51,945
I think you know.

622
01:14:01,402 --> 01:14:02,235
Oh, god.

623
01:14:03,922 --> 01:14:05,005
Just get out.

624
01:14:05,869 --> 01:14:07,119
Leave me alone!

625
01:14:08,133 --> 01:14:11,268
I think you know that's impossible.

626
01:14:11,269 --> 01:14:14,686
I can't leave, because
I'm a part of you.

627
01:14:27,562 --> 01:14:28,395
No.

628
01:14:29,795 --> 01:14:31,878
No, no, no you're not me.

629
01:14:32,962 --> 01:14:33,795
You're--

630
01:14:34,864 --> 01:14:37,197
You're not me, you're a lie!

631
01:14:40,682 --> 01:14:41,682
No, Penny.

632
01:14:43,624 --> 01:14:45,624
I'm the only real truth.

633
01:14:47,560 --> 01:14:50,060
Open your eyes and you'll see,...

634
01:14:51,112 --> 01:14:54,445
...I'm the part of you
that you can't face.

635
01:14:57,973 --> 01:15:02,521
I'm the one that got you
through all this blood...

636
01:15:02,522 --> 01:15:05,522
...and all the shit,
and all the death.

637
01:15:09,112 --> 01:15:10,195
Take my hand.

638
01:15:12,093 --> 01:15:12,926
Why?

639
01:15:14,720 --> 01:15:16,839
Why are you here?

640
01:15:16,840 --> 01:15:17,923
I told you.

641
01:15:18,824 --> 01:15:20,359
I'm here to free you.

642
01:15:20,360 --> 01:15:22,110
Free me to do what?

643
01:15:23,442 --> 01:15:25,903
To fulfill your destiny.

644
01:15:25,904 --> 01:15:29,904
There's work to be done
and I can't do it alone.

645
01:15:45,537 --> 01:15:48,119
You've been suffering for weeks.

646
01:15:48,120 --> 01:15:49,953
You must be exhausted.

647
01:15:58,130 --> 01:15:59,130
Don't worry.

648
01:16:00,519 --> 01:16:03,519
I know how to make the pain go away.

649
01:16:10,150 --> 01:16:10,983
Yeah.

650
01:16:15,010 --> 01:16:15,843
So do I.

651
01:16:32,407 --> 01:16:33,526
Hello, Dr. Lentz.

652
01:16:33,527 --> 01:16:34,876
Jesus Christ!

653
01:16:34,877 --> 01:16:36,624
Penny, you scared me!

654
01:16:36,625 --> 01:16:38,024
What are you doing here?

655
01:16:41,338 --> 01:16:43,766
You left your door unlocked.

656
01:16:43,767 --> 01:16:45,713
That's a very dangerous
thing to do, I mean,...

657
01:16:45,714 --> 01:16:47,624
...anybody could have
came walkin' in here.

658
01:16:47,625 --> 01:16:49,344
Well, at least I'm glad it's you,...

659
01:16:49,345 --> 01:16:50,966
...but what are you doing here?

660
01:16:50,967 --> 01:16:53,145
I don't understand. Did we have
an appointment or something?

661
01:16:53,146 --> 01:16:55,033
I don't, I don't get this.

662
01:16:55,034 --> 01:16:58,117
You see, I have come to a point of,...

663
01:17:00,035 --> 01:17:01,452
...self-realization.

664
01:17:02,327 --> 01:17:04,537
Penny, you need help.

665
01:17:04,538 --> 01:17:05,788
That's right.

666
01:17:08,306 --> 01:17:10,966
Everybody wants to help me.

667
01:17:10,967 --> 01:17:14,217
Penny, this is not, this is not good.

668
01:17:15,607 --> 01:17:16,440
Here.

669
01:17:18,394 --> 01:17:20,036
Penny, you can't quit
these cold turkey,...

670
01:17:20,037 --> 01:17:21,464
...they're too strong!

671
01:17:21,465 --> 01:17:24,777
Without, you know, side-effects?

672
01:17:24,778 --> 01:17:26,086
Headaches and nausea,...

673
01:17:26,087 --> 01:17:29,046
...and irritability and anxiety,
oh I know.

674
01:17:29,047 --> 01:17:31,526
- Trust me, I know.
- Penny, Penny, please.

675
01:17:31,527 --> 01:17:32,360
Please.

676
01:17:33,447 --> 01:17:36,633
I decided I needed my own life back.

677
01:17:36,634 --> 01:17:41,537
I decided I needed to tell
what was real and what wasn't.

678
01:17:41,538 --> 01:17:43,505
Penny, I don't understand.

679
01:17:48,757 --> 01:17:54,441
I can't believe it took me
this long to figure.. out!

680
01:17:56,319 --> 01:17:58,689
You and your fuckin' drugs!

681
01:17:58,690 --> 01:18:00,773
You killed that reporter!

682
01:18:01,828 --> 01:18:04,019
She had a big mouth.

683
01:18:04,020 --> 01:18:06,358
She was putting everything
together anyways.

684
01:18:06,359 --> 01:18:09,067
She was gonna figure things out.

685
01:18:10,530 --> 01:18:11,809
Yeah.

686
01:18:11,810 --> 01:18:13,809
And what did Sunny do to you?

687
01:18:13,810 --> 01:18:15,679
Why did you kill her?

688
01:18:15,680 --> 01:18:18,657
- Why did you kill any of them?
- Stop it.

689
01:18:18,658 --> 01:18:22,337
I had to do it, I had to kill them.

690
01:18:22,338 --> 01:18:25,369
They were putting things together
like that bitch detective.

691
01:18:25,370 --> 01:18:27,977
She had to learn how to mind
her own fucking business.

692
01:18:29,289 --> 01:18:31,206
Please stop hitting me.

693
01:18:32,100 --> 01:18:33,881
Why me? Why me?

694
01:18:33,882 --> 01:18:34,851
Tell me, why me?

695
01:18:34,852 --> 01:18:37,753
After everything I've
been through, why me!

696
01:18:41,068 --> 01:18:42,624
Stop it.

697
01:18:42,625 --> 01:18:44,064
Please.

698
01:18:44,065 --> 01:18:47,515
Give me some god-damn answers...
And maybe I'll think about it!

699
01:18:47,516 --> 01:18:51,683
I will, will, just please, please
stop fucking hurting me.

700
01:19:04,945 --> 01:19:07,253
I was Wojowski's doctor.

701
01:19:07,254 --> 01:19:09,213
He came to me four years ago.

702
01:19:09,214 --> 01:19:11,955
I tried to keep him off the books.

703
01:19:11,956 --> 01:19:15,539
He was perfect for what
I was trying to do.

704
01:19:16,614 --> 01:19:19,031
He was like clay in my hands.

705
01:19:20,465 --> 01:19:24,942
He had been abused his
entire childhood, and--

706
01:19:24,943 --> 01:19:28,205
I had always wondered
what all that anger...

707
01:19:28,206 --> 01:19:32,325
...would be like in that powerful
huge individual like him.

708
01:19:32,326 --> 01:19:35,744
Would there be an outlet for it.

709
01:19:35,745 --> 01:19:37,828
And you gave it to him.

710
01:19:39,086 --> 01:19:41,086
You gave him my friends.

711
01:19:42,006 --> 01:19:42,839
And me.

712
01:19:45,716 --> 01:19:47,595
I needed to know.

713
01:19:47,596 --> 01:19:50,275
Medicine needed to know.

714
01:19:50,276 --> 01:19:52,373
What makes someone kill.

715
01:19:52,374 --> 01:19:55,773
Is it a switch that you pull off and on?

716
01:19:55,774 --> 01:19:56,607
Is it--

717
01:19:57,745 --> 01:20:01,912
Is it something that can be
controlled and I needed to know!

718
01:20:03,783 --> 01:20:05,950
What made you kill, Penny?

719
01:20:07,726 --> 01:20:11,075
What made someone like you
take another man's life?

720
01:20:21,143 --> 01:20:24,226
I killed Wojowski because I had to!

721
01:20:25,294 --> 01:20:26,127
But you?

722
01:20:27,334 --> 01:20:30,304
I'm gonna kill you because I want to.

723
01:20:32,302 --> 01:20:36,830
Killing me...
Only proves that I was right.

724
01:20:37,926 --> 01:20:39,184
Fine.

725
01:20:39,185 --> 01:20:40,435
You were right.

726
01:21:14,099 --> 01:21:16,287
They're gonna be coming
for me soon,...

727
01:21:16,288 --> 01:21:18,138
...because of what you did,...

728
01:21:18,139 --> 01:21:21,306
...you and that monster
that you created.

729
01:21:22,637 --> 01:21:25,470
Whatever.

730
01:21:26,750 --> 01:21:30,949
I guess we're gonna see
how this all ends, huh?

731
01:21:45,445 --> 01:21:46,445
Dr. Lentz!

732
01:21:48,357 --> 01:21:51,404
Dr. Lentz, we need to speak
with you, it's very important!

733
01:21:51,405 --> 01:21:53,676
It's about a call you made
to one of our detectives.

734
01:21:53,677 --> 01:21:55,344
Detective Hatherton.

735
01:21:58,485 --> 01:22:00,175
Dr. Lentz!

736
01:22:00,176 --> 01:22:01,009
Doctor--

737
01:22:16,550 --> 01:22:17,621
Is there anybody here?

738
01:22:17,622 --> 01:22:21,705
If there's anybody here,
show yourself right now!

739
01:22:51,699 --> 01:22:52,866
Damnit, Penny.

740
01:24:31,339 --> 01:24:32,172
Kim?

741
01:24:34,579 --> 01:24:35,545
Fuck.

742
01:24:35,546 --> 01:24:36,379
Jake.

743
01:24:38,397 --> 01:24:40,147
What have you done?

744
01:24:41,146 --> 01:24:41,979
Do it.

745
01:24:43,568 --> 01:24:44,918
Go on.

746
01:24:44,919 --> 01:24:46,068
Shoot me.

747
01:24:46,069 --> 01:24:47,489
Blow me straight to hell.

748
01:24:47,490 --> 01:24:50,907
You honestly think I give
a shit anymore?

749
01:24:52,050 --> 01:24:53,588
Why?

750
01:24:53,589 --> 01:24:54,422
Why her?

751
01:24:56,698 --> 01:24:58,365
I didn't kill her.

752
01:24:59,479 --> 01:25:01,948
I found her like that
whenever I got here.

753
01:25:01,949 --> 01:25:03,366
And the doctor?

754
01:25:04,319 --> 01:25:05,402
It was him.

755
01:25:06,389 --> 01:25:08,056
He was your copycat.

756
01:25:10,810 --> 01:25:12,976
It was him right from the beginning.

757
01:25:12,977 --> 01:25:16,809
Just the puppet-master
pulling all the strings.

758
01:25:16,810 --> 01:25:19,278
I checked his cell phone records.

759
01:25:19,279 --> 01:25:23,769
There were dozens of calls
made to a prepaid cell phone...

760
01:25:23,770 --> 01:25:26,937
...purchased by him
with his credit card.

761
01:25:27,906 --> 01:25:32,238
Most of them around the time
that you and your friends--

762
01:25:32,239 --> 01:25:36,406
Yeah, he was training Wojowski,
right from the beginning.

763
01:25:38,218 --> 01:25:42,975
Just pushing him over the edge,
just a little bit to unleash...

764
01:25:42,976 --> 01:25:45,893
...that killer that was inside of him.

765
01:25:47,530 --> 01:25:49,863
He did the same thing to me.

766
01:25:50,829 --> 01:25:54,409
I killed everybody I cared about.

767
01:25:54,410 --> 01:25:58,617
And anybody that got in the way.

768
01:25:58,618 --> 01:26:00,769
Like Sunny and that reporter.

769
01:26:00,770 --> 01:26:01,603
And Kim?

770
01:26:02,586 --> 01:26:04,657
He wanted to see just
how much I could take...

771
01:26:04,658 --> 01:26:07,825
...until I just went right
over the edge.

772
01:26:09,657 --> 01:26:11,990
Well I guess he found out.

773
01:26:15,039 --> 01:26:16,569
I guess he did.

774
01:26:16,570 --> 01:26:19,016
Then why not come to me for help?

775
01:26:19,017 --> 01:26:22,934
Penny, why did you bring
me back here, to this?

776
01:26:24,469 --> 01:26:27,469
This is where it all began for me.

777
01:26:29,747 --> 01:26:36,238
If Lentz was right...
Then whatever it was inside of me,...

778
01:26:36,239 --> 01:26:40,156
...that just woke up whenever
I killed Wojowski--

779
01:26:43,381 --> 01:26:46,798
It's not gonna end,
it's never gonna end.

780
01:26:49,370 --> 01:26:50,203
And--

781
01:26:53,861 --> 01:26:54,944
Those dreams.

782
01:26:56,271 --> 01:26:59,438
The dreams are just getting
more and more vivid,...

783
01:26:59,439 --> 01:27:01,390
...and more and more frequent.

784
01:27:01,391 --> 01:27:04,974
You didn't kill Sunny,
and that reporter.

785
01:27:06,127 --> 01:27:07,960
Penny, I believe that.

786
01:27:09,631 --> 01:27:11,548
Well, maybe I didn't.

787
01:27:15,541 --> 01:27:16,874
But I wanted to.

788
01:27:19,671 --> 01:27:22,754
I could actually see myself doing it.

789
01:27:26,250 --> 01:27:30,140
And if that's the way the rest
of my life is gonna be,...

790
01:27:30,141 --> 01:27:32,558
...then I don't even wanna live.

791
01:27:34,370 --> 01:27:35,203
No.

792
01:27:36,591 --> 01:27:38,174
What Lentz started,...

793
01:27:39,959 --> 01:27:43,597
...is gonna finish...
Right here, and now.

794
01:28:17,542 --> 01:28:22,040
You know, they made so many
of these in the 80s.

795
01:28:22,041 --> 01:28:26,208
I was a little too young to
remember but I checked.

796
01:28:27,841 --> 01:28:30,948
Turns out that you can
buy a bunch of 'em...

797
01:28:30,949 --> 01:28:33,616
...on the internet next to nothing.

798
01:28:35,771 --> 01:28:38,960
I don't know if it was Wojowski
or if it was Lentz...

799
01:28:38,961 --> 01:28:44,890
...that chose it, but,
whoever it was did a good job.

800
01:28:47,531 --> 01:28:51,698
Just all sorts of goodies that
you can just store in here.

801
01:28:57,891 --> 01:29:01,474
Whatever you're
planning on doing, don't.

802
01:29:04,194 --> 01:29:07,194
We can go to the prosecutor about--

803
01:29:08,281 --> 01:29:09,281
About Lentz.

804
01:29:11,837 --> 01:29:15,293
With all that you've been through,...

805
01:29:15,294 --> 01:29:18,627
...I'm sure that we can work
something out.

806
01:29:22,797 --> 01:29:25,066
I'm sorry, Jake.

807
01:29:25,067 --> 01:29:26,067
I really am.

808
01:29:33,957 --> 01:29:36,124
You know this game, right?

809
01:29:36,976 --> 01:29:38,643
You run and I chase.

810
01:29:40,445 --> 01:29:43,445
If Lentz was right, then I kill you.

811
01:29:45,733 --> 01:29:49,177
If not, you get away and
you bring back a posse...

812
01:29:49,178 --> 01:29:50,761
...to come and get me.

813
01:29:52,538 --> 01:29:57,098
Either way,...
This is gonna end today.

814
01:30:04,757 --> 01:30:05,590
Go.

815
01:33:55,638 --> 01:33:56,555
Stay there!

816
01:33:57,672 --> 01:33:58,589
Don't move.

817
01:34:00,638 --> 01:34:02,167
Penny.

818
01:34:02,168 --> 01:34:04,378
This isn't you.

819
01:34:06,699 --> 01:34:09,665
Stop acting like you know me, Jake!

820
01:34:09,666 --> 01:34:13,367
You don't know me, you
don't know the real me!

821
01:34:13,368 --> 01:34:17,535
There's something behind these
eyes that are just screaming!

822
01:34:18,427 --> 01:34:21,094
And it wants to kill everything!

823
01:34:23,835 --> 01:34:25,298
Penny.

824
01:34:25,299 --> 01:34:28,447
It's not--

825
01:34:28,448 --> 01:34:32,615
It's not you, it's, it's
everything that's happened to you.

826
01:34:34,196 --> 01:34:37,666
It's Lentz and all his
bullshit theories.

827
01:34:37,667 --> 01:34:41,145
The real you can choose
who you wanna be.

828
01:34:41,146 --> 01:34:43,479
I know that you know I've--

829
01:34:45,304 --> 01:34:48,668
I've come to care about
you a great deal.

830
01:34:48,669 --> 01:34:51,901
Shut up!

831
01:34:51,902 --> 01:34:53,917
There isn't enough going on
that I gotta worry about...

832
01:34:53,918 --> 01:34:57,330
...some detective having
a schoolboy crush on me.

833
01:34:57,331 --> 01:34:58,164
Come on!

834
01:34:59,470 --> 01:35:01,970
I'm just trying to help you
remember the girl you were...

835
01:35:01,971 --> 01:35:04,638
...before all this happened to you.

836
01:35:18,017 --> 01:35:18,850
No.

837
01:35:19,806 --> 01:35:21,336
No.

838
01:35:21,337 --> 01:35:24,205
No, there's no going back.

839
01:35:24,206 --> 01:35:25,123
Not for me.

840
01:35:30,107 --> 01:35:30,940
Well--

841
01:35:31,817 --> 01:35:35,753
Then I guess--

842
01:35:35,754 --> 01:35:38,587
You're gonna have to kill me then.

843
01:35:43,555 --> 01:35:44,638
I guess so.

844
01:35:46,536 --> 01:35:49,536
And, if you kill me, that means--

845
01:35:50,467 --> 01:35:53,300
Oh, this thing, that's inside you,...

846
01:35:54,605 --> 01:35:57,575
...that means that is
who you really are.

847
01:35:57,576 --> 01:35:59,153
No.

848
01:35:59,154 --> 01:36:02,154
No more mind games, no more nothing.

849
01:36:03,274 --> 01:36:04,441
This all ends.

850
01:36:13,413 --> 01:36:15,163
I'm, I'm sorry, Jake.

851
01:36:16,576 --> 01:36:17,895
Yeah.

852
01:36:20,244 --> 01:36:21,244
Me too.

853
01:36:49,811 --> 01:36:50,644
Damnit.

854
01:36:52,772 --> 01:36:54,258
Fine.

855
01:36:54,259 --> 01:36:55,092
Go ahead.

856
01:36:56,310 --> 01:36:57,893
Just make it quick.

857
01:37:02,270 --> 01:37:03,686
Come on, Penny.

858
01:37:03,687 --> 01:37:06,178
What the fuck are you doing?

859
01:37:06,179 --> 01:37:07,698
I told you.

860
01:37:07,699 --> 01:37:09,949
I just, wanted to help you.

861
01:37:11,648 --> 01:37:14,481
Well you can't, can you?

862
01:38:15,810 --> 01:38:16,697
Mosser!

863
01:38:16,698 --> 01:38:18,121
There is no way on earth
I'm gonna let you...

864
01:38:18,122 --> 01:38:19,447
...interrogate that woman.

865
01:38:19,448 --> 01:38:22,201
Yeah, you and the DA try and stop me.

866
01:38:22,202 --> 01:38:25,888
Chief will have your badge for this.
