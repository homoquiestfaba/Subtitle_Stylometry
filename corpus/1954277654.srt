to West Memphis with him,

243

00:32:10,304 --> 00:32:12,556
<i>I know, but this crime is unthinkable.</i>

332
00:32:13,098 --> 00:32:15,225
<i>What if they did it? Have you thought of that?</i>

333
00:32:15,351 --> 00:32:17,686
And what if they didn't? And even if they did,

334
00:32:18,228 --> 00:32:21,315
I think three dead kids is enough.
I'm on my way.

335
00:32:22,274 --> 00:32:25,027
Mr. Lax, I'm Dan Stidham.
I represent Jessie Misskelley.

336
00:32:25,444 --> 00:32:29,198
This is Paul Ford from Jonesboro.
He represents Jason Baldwin.

337
00:32:29,323 --> 00:32:31,951
And Val Price is the public defender
who's been appointed

338
00:32:32,034 --> 00:32:34,411
to represent Damien Echols.
Please have a seat.

339
00:32:38,666 --> 00:32:40,793
I understand Jessie has
recanted his confession.

340
00:32:40,876 --> 00:32:41,919
Does that surprise you?

341
00:32:42,002 --> 00:32:44,046
No. It's hard to believe anyone would confess

342
00:32:44,129 --> 00:32:45,673
to such a crime if he hadn't done it.

343
00:32:46,465 --> 00:32:47,841
Got any experts lined up?

344
00:32:48,050 --> 00:32:50,469
I've got a doctor who will testify that Jessie

345
00:32:50,552 --> 00:32:52,596
reasons on the level of a six to eight-year-old.

346
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:55,057
He was once diagnosed as mentally retarded.

347
00:32:55,975 --> 00:32:59,478
- Do you think he's guilty?
- In my experience, most of them are.

348
00:33:02,940 --> 00:33:05,776
PRICE: <i>So Mr. Lax,
if they're most likely guilty,</i>

349
00:33:05,943 --> 00:33:08,237
<i>why volunteer to help us build a case?</i>

350
00:33:08,404 --> 00:33:11,407
LAX: <i>Because if you don't have</i> a <i>strong case,</i>

351
00:33:11,448 --> 00:33:14,243
<i>the State is going to kill three young men.</i>

352
00:33:14,910 --> 00:33:17,454
<i>And I can't stand by and watch that happen.</i>

353
00:33:17,538 --> 00:33:19,498
<i>Now, tell me about Damien Echols.</i>

354
00:33:20,249 --> 00:33:24,044
<i>STIDHAM: He lives in a trailer park
with his family, on social assistance.</i>

355
00:33:24,086 --> 00:33:27,423
<i>Difficult kid.
He's had serious run-ins with the law.</i>

356
00:33:28,007 --> 00:33:30,426
<i>He spent time in juvenile detention.</i>

357
00:33:31,844 --> 00:33:37,433
Now being as I've been his probation officer
for as long as I've been,

358
00:33:37,516 --> 00:33:41,020
he always seems to me to be like one of these

359
00:33:42,771 --> 00:33:44,523
slasher movie-type guys.

360
00:33:45,774 --> 00:33:50,195
His boots and coat, heavy metal music,

361
00:33:52,197 --> 00:33:54,116
long, stringy black hair.

362
00:33:55,534 --> 00:33:58,120
Now, may I... Have you seen his case file?

363
00:33:58,871 --> 00:34:03,584
I mean, this boy is troubled.
He's been in and out of psychiatric wards.

364
00:34:04,001 --> 00:34:06,462
And he said he was involved in the occult.

365
00:34:06,503 --> 00:34:09,631
Oh, yeah. Some of his followers
included Jason Baldwin.

366
00:34:09,965 --> 00:34:12,968
And of course, his pregnant girlfriend.

367
00:34:13,010 --> 00:34:17,514
He's got her name carved on his arm.

368
00:34:18,307 --> 00:34:21,310
- And I worry about that baby.
- Why?

369
00:34:22,102 --> 00:34:24,313
Because of the rumor
that they're going to sacrifice it to Satan.

370
00:34:24,396 --> 00:34:25,439
You're saying you actually believe that?

371
00:34:25,481 --> 00:34:27,649
- You bet I do.
- Come on, Jerry.

372
00:34:30,194 --> 00:34:33,697
All that occult-crime,
Satanic-panic stuff's been studied by the FBI

373
00:34:33,781 --> 00:34:35,949
and they say it's all smoke and no fire.

374
00:34:35,991 --> 00:34:38,702
I know what I've seen with my own two eyes.

375
00:34:39,286 --> 00:34:42,456
And I'm telling you evidence of occult
activity was everywhere that summer.

376
00:34:44,958 --> 00:34:47,252
In this old abandoned schoolhouse...

377
00:34:48,212 --> 00:34:50,631
I mean, Steve Jones saw something.

378
00:34:54,426 --> 00:34:59,098
<i>It's like a picture I'd seen
in a book about the serial killer, Son of Sam.</i>

379
00:34:59,306 --> 00:35:02,518
<i>Like somebody had restaged the scene.</i>

380
00:35:04,019 --> 00:35:07,606
<i>Or re-enacted it. So ever since that summer</i>

381
00:35:07,689 --> 00:35:10,776
<i>I've been telling the local police to watch him.</i>

382
00:35:11,610 --> 00:35:13,278
'Cause I knew something bad
was gonna happen.

383
00:35:14,947 --> 00:35:17,282
I sent Steve Jones over to Damien's house.

384
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:21,328
<i>And he found all sorts of
crazy stuff in Damien's room.</i>

385
00:35:21,703 --> 00:35:24,039
<i>Evidence of his interest in the occult.</i>

386
00:35:28,043 --> 00:35:30,921
<i>About a year ago, Damien told me
that the local devil worshippers</i>

387
00:35:31,004 --> 00:35:33,465
<i>had reached the end of their
animal sacrifice stage.</i>

388
00:35:33,549 --> 00:35:36,135
<i>And I'm talking about things
they do to receive power.</i>

389
00:35:36,677 --> 00:35:42,141
So that summer, he said they
were gonna take the next logical step.

390
00:35:43,934 --> 00:35:47,187
Sacrifice a human. A human.

391
00:35:49,815 --> 00:35:53,986
- Stevie.
- Pam. Dreaming again.

392
00:35:55,404 --> 00:35:56,780
Dream.

393
00:35:58,282 --> 00:35:59,283
Come here.

394
00:36:19,261 --> 00:36:21,597
You have asthma and you smoke?

395
00:36:22,848 --> 00:36:24,933
I guess I'm just self-destructive.

396
00:36:28,604 --> 00:36:31,815
I spoke to your probation officer, Jerry Driver.

397
00:36:32,649 --> 00:36:35,402
- He had a lot to say about you.
- I bet.

398
00:36:37,571 --> 00:36:40,616
Said they found a lot of stuff in your room.

399
00:36:40,699 --> 00:36:44,077
- Evidence of your interest in the occult.
- My notebooks.

400
00:36:45,370 --> 00:36:47,206
They're just song lyrics I liked.

401
00:36:47,956 --> 00:36:50,709
Quotes from my favorite books and movies.

402
00:36:51,460 --> 00:36:53,921
What about the things you told him?

403
00:36:54,504 --> 00:36:57,549
About devil worshippers
planning on making human sacrifices.

404
00:37:00,302 --> 00:37:02,471
I was just messing with his mind.

405
00:37:04,514 --> 00:37:08,644
That you threatened to eat your father
and out your mother's throat.

406
00:37:09,186 --> 00:37:10,812
Driver's a liar.

407
00:37:11,438 --> 00:37:16,818
It's not just Driver. There's a lot of people
saying things, damaging things.

408
00:37:18,904 --> 00:37:20,155
Listen to this.

409
00:37:20,197 --> 00:37:21,990
Why should I listen to you?

410
00:37:22,824 --> 00:37:25,869
Why should I answer your questions?
Are you my lawyer?

411
00:37:26,453 --> 00:37:28,997
No. I'm working with them.

412
00:37:29,831 --> 00:37:34,962
You're working for them?
What are you, like a lawyer's assistant?

413
00:37:36,630 --> 00:37:38,048
I'm an investigator.

414
00:37:39,132 --> 00:37:41,551
But you won't be representing me in court.

415
00:37:42,177 --> 00:37:45,430
No. No, I'm not allowed to do that.

416
00:37:46,390 --> 00:37:49,268
So I'm just supposed to trust you?
Tell you everything?

417
00:37:50,060 --> 00:37:52,271
If you want me to help you, yes.

418
00:37:59,403 --> 00:38:01,196
Those cops are scary, okay?

419
00:38:03,156 --> 00:38:08,161
They will do anything to get people
to say what they want to hear.

420
00:38:11,415 --> 00:38:14,167
Why would so many people
say all these things about you?

421
00:38:14,835 --> 00:38:18,338
Why did those girls say
people were witches back in Salem?

422
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:21,133
Any time anything weird
happens around here,

423
00:38:21,216 --> 00:38:23,760
people blame it on devil worshippers.

424
00:38:25,095 --> 00:38:26,346
And on me.

425
00:38:31,310 --> 00:38:35,647
What about the incident when you were
locked up at the JDC in Jonesboro?

426
00:38:35,731 --> 00:38:37,357
They say you drank some kid's blood.

427
00:38:37,983 --> 00:38:41,486
I didn't attack him. He offered it.

428
00:38:43,405 --> 00:38:48,201
I did that with a knife.
That's my girlfriend's name.

429
00:38:48,744 --> 00:38:51,455
I've been cutting myself for a long time.

430
00:38:51,538 --> 00:38:52,831
Why?

431
00:38:54,583 --> 00:38:56,877
There's power in the blood.

432
00:38:58,045 --> 00:38:59,838
It's how we get power.

433
00:39:01,131 --> 00:39:04,176
Through drinking the blood of others.

434
00:39:06,094 --> 00:39:09,264

435

I was, like, 10 years old.

I'm not.

00:39:26,323 --> 00:39:29,117
They think I'm in a cult. I'm not.

439
00:39:29,409 --> 00:39:33,163
I just have an interest in witchcraft

440
00:39:33,246 --> 00:39:36,333
as a way to power, to control.

441
00:39:43,465 --> 00:39:47,552
Pam, do you feel the people
who did this were worshipping, um...

442
00:39:48,595 --> 00:39:52,099
- Satan? Yes, I do. I do.
- Why?

443
00:39:52,808 --> 00:39:58,146
Just look at 'em.
They look like punks. They look like freaks.

444
00:39:58,980 --> 00:40:01,900
You don't look like that
when you're, like, a normal person.

445
00:40:02,109 --> 00:40:05,362
And they listen to that music.

446
00:40:05,904 --> 00:40:10,283

I heard from a bunch of people

447
00:40:10,492 --> 00:40:14,913
that they been hearing that they been,
you know, worshipping Satan

Treating his scarf like some kind of prop.

465
00:41:46,421 --> 00:41:50,509

00:42:14,282 --> 00:42:16,117
you blamed him. You was jealous of him.

01:00:21,577 --> 01:00:23,037
TERRY: Hey.

665
01:00:28,208 --> 01:00:30,127
You stay away from us.

666
01:00:32,129 --> 01:00:35,841
You don't talk to her. Understand?

667
01:00:38,886 --> 01:00:43,891
You hear me?
You bother my wife, and by God, it's on.

668
01:00:43,932 --> 01:00:47,478
All right, Terry, let's go home.
Come on. Come on.

669
01:00:52,399 --> 01:00:57,821
JOHN: ...and I say bring it on.
For me this place is like hell on Earth.

670
01:00:58,739 --> 01:01:04,912
'Cause I know three babies were killed.
I know my son was castrated.

671
01:01:05,496 --> 01:01:07,998
And lay on that bank and bled to death.

672
01:01:08,207 --> 01:01:09,875
I know he was choked.

673
01:01:14,088 --> 01:01:16,090
How's the documentary coming along?

674
01:01:16,298 --> 01:01:17,841
Y'all been here every day, right?

675
01:01:17,925 --> 01:01:20,260
Interviewing families. Must be fascinating.

676
01:01:23,055 --> 01:01:26,558
Yeah. We're, uh, getting some
pretty good stuff.

677
01:01:27,893 --> 01:01:30,604
Especially John Mark Byers
seems to like the attention.

678
01:01:30,771 --> 01:01:32,439
Well, he's not shy, that's for sure.

679
01:01:32,648 --> 01:01:36,110
Did he ever do or say anything unusual?

680
01:01:36,819 --> 01:01:41,532
I don't just mean holding
forth for cameras and reporters.

681
01:01:43,075 --> 01:01:46,578
I mean, like something suspicious or strange?

682
01:01:47,287 --> 01:01:52,459
Yeah. He did do something strange.
Very strange.

683
01:01:54,044 --> 01:01:57,673
He gave this as a gift
to the documentary crew.

684
01:01:58,382 --> 01:02:01,093
So when were you planning
on telling us about it?

685
01:02:01,427 --> 01:02:04,930
Mr. Fogleman released the
records concerning this knife yesterday.

686
01:02:06,014 --> 01:02:09,518
But you've known about it for months.
How could you not tell us about it?

687
01:02:09,643 --> 01:02:13,147
Well, we had to send it to the lab first.
DNA testing.

688
01:02:13,480 --> 01:02:15,274
There was blood on the knife.

689
01:02:15,774 --> 01:02:17,484
Just a little bit.

690
01:02:17,609 --> 01:02:21,989
I'll show you right here.
Lock joint where the blade folds back.

691
01:02:22,448 --> 01:02:23,449
Just not much.

692
01:02:25,200 --> 01:02:28,704
Where you might miss it
if you're trying to wipe the blade clean.

693
01:02:31,165 --> 01:02:33,167
That did cross my mind.

694
01:02:33,834 --> 01:02:38,338
On January 26, 1994, Gitchell asked
you, "Have you used the knife?"

695
01:02:38,380 --> 01:02:41,300
And you said, "I never used it.
Hopefully I was going to use it

696
01:02:41,341 --> 01:02:45,012
"for deer hunting, but I never
had the opportunity to use it on a deer."

697
01:02:45,095 --> 01:02:49,892
That's right. But the reason that I said that
was 'cause I never hunted with it.

698
01:02:50,100 --> 01:02:53,604
I didn't mean that I didn't try to use it
to cut some venison.

699
01:02:54,313 --> 01:02:57,399
Did Inspector Gitchell
tell you, "We found blood on this knife"?

700
01:02:57,483 --> 01:02:58,567
I don't remember.

701
01:02:58,734 --> 01:03:01,236
Check your transcript. Page 7.

702
01:03:01,695 --> 01:03:05,032
Now, I'll ask you again. Did Gitchell tell you,

703
01:03:05,199 --> 01:03:08,702
"We found blood on this knife"?

704
01:03:09,077 --> 01:03:10,078
Yes, sir.

705
01:03:10,162 --> 01:03:13,665
Did Gitchell tell you
the blood on the knife was Chris' blood?

706
01:03:13,874 --> 01:03:15,542
I don't remember. It might be in here.

707
01:03:15,626 --> 01:03:18,086
Did you tell Gitchell, "I have no idea

708
01:03:18,170 --> 01:03:20,047
"how Chris' blood could be on that knife"?

709
01:03:20,172 --> 01:03:23,217
Yes, sir. I would not have any idea.

710
01:03:23,383 --> 01:03:26,887
Did you have any idea
how human blood was on the knife?

711
01:03:27,137 --> 01:03:30,432
Well, yes. As I was trying to use the knife

712
01:03:30,516 --> 01:03:33,560
to cut some venison
and make some beef jerky with it,

713
01:03:34,102 --> 01:03:35,646
I cut my thumb.

714
01:03:35,729 --> 01:03:37,731
Mr. Byers, do you recall saying,

715
01:03:37,815 --> 01:03:41,527
"I don't even remember nicking myself with it
cutting the deer meat or anything"?

716
01:03:41,568 --> 01:03:43,612
- Is that the answer you gave?
- Yes, sir.

717
01:03:43,695 --> 01:03:45,364
And is it the truth?

718
01:03:45,572 --> 01:03:48,700
At the time that he was
questioning me, I didn't...

719
01:03:48,909 --> 01:03:52,412
I mean, I might not have remembered.

720
01:03:52,704 --> 01:03:57,459
But then later on in the clay, I could have
remembered and talked to him about it then.

721
01:04:10,347 --> 01:04:11,890
You all right, buddy? You did great.

722

-(CHURCH BELLS TOLLING)
- JOHN: I wasn't expecting that.

723
01:04:17,437 --> 01:04:23,777
I ran and Jessie caught me. Uh, he tied me up.

724
01:04:25,571 --> 01:04:27,281
How did they tie you up?

725
01:04:27,573 --> 01:04:28,782
Rope.

726
01:04:29,157 --> 01:04:34,413
<i>Then he grabbed my hands
and made me cut Chris.</i>

727
01:04:35,789 --> 01:04:41,378
<i>Jessie and Damien picked him up
and put a bucket where he was bleeding.</i>

728
01:04:42,963 --> 01:04:47,926
<i>Then they poured it in a glass
and made me drink it.</i>

729
01:04:51,805 --> 01:04:55,309
<i>GITCHELL: They poured his blood in</i> a <i>glass
and made you drink it?</i>

730
01:04:55,392 --> 01:04:56,643
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

731
01:04:56,727 --> 01:05:00,105
<i>Aaron, you're not... You're
not making this up, are you?</i>

732
01:05:00,230 --> 01:05:01,273
<i>No.</i>

733
01:05:01,315 --> 01:05:03,483
<i>- I mean, you and I are buddies, right?
-Yeah.</i>

734
01:05:03,567 --> 01:05:06,486
<i>We're buddies. You wouldn't be
telling me a story, would you?</i>

735
01:05:06,570 --> 01:05:07,654
<i>No.</i>

736
01:05:07,738 --> 01:05:09,865
<i>How do I know that you're
telling me the truth?</i>

737
01:05:10,532 --> 01:05:13,035
I don't know.

738
01:05:13,327 --> 01:05:15,996
Good afternoon. My name's Ron Lax.

739
01:05:16,079 --> 01:05:18,123
I'm an investigator working with the attorneys

740
01:05:18,165 --> 01:05:21,668
who represent Damien Echols
and Jason Baldwin.

741
01:05:24,004 --> 01:05:29,009
Um, please, I can't talk to you. Okay?

742
01:05:29,760 --> 01:05:31,720
I don't want to get involved.

743
01:05:33,138 --> 01:05:35,098
Mrs. Hutcheson, you're already involved.

744
01:05:35,349 --> 01:05:37,935
You feature prominently
in the prosecution's case.

745
01:05:38,060 --> 01:05:39,603
And from what I can tell,
you're the only real link

746
01:05:39,686 --> 01:05:42,731
between Jessie Misskelley
and Damien Echols.

747
01:05:42,814 --> 01:05:46,777
No.
(CHUCKLES) No, I can't talk about it.

748
01:05:48,695 --> 01:05:50,614
You gotta ask Don.

749
01:05:50,864 --> 01:05:52,866
- Detective Donald Bray?
- Yes.

750
01:05:53,617 --> 01:05:59,748
Yes, he... You just ask Don.
I gotta go now, I'm sorry.

751
01:06:00,540 --> 01:06:03,877
So why did Vicki Hutcheson come see you?
Was she in trouble?

752
01:06:04,711 --> 01:06:09,216
She, uh, looked to be part of a credit card
scam at a truck stop where she worked.

753
01:06:09,341 --> 01:06:10,425
So I called her in.

754
01:06:11,093 --> 01:06:15,055
She brought her kid in
the day after those boys went missing.

755
01:06:16,682 --> 01:06:22,062
I just wanted to let you know
that my boy, Aaron,

756
01:06:22,104 --> 01:06:24,231
is a close friend of them missing boys.

757
01:06:24,523 --> 01:06:28,026
Michael Moore and Chris Byers
are his two best friends.

758
01:06:28,151 --> 01:06:31,655
You think you might know something
to help the police find them boys?

759
01:06:32,197 --> 01:06:37,077
I'd say it's very possible. Right, honey?
It is possible.

760
01:06:37,869 --> 01:06:41,373
We questioned Aaron.
He told us about the meetings in the woods.

761
01:06:41,540 --> 01:06:45,043
It made sense to me.
I already knew about the Satanic cult.

762
01:06:45,836 --> 01:06:47,462
You knew about the cult?

763
01:06:47,671 --> 01:06:51,925
We been expecting something like this
to happen around here for quite a while.

764
01:06:52,968 --> 01:06:54,803
How did you confirm Aaron's story?

765
01:06:54,928 --> 01:06:56,304
Questioned Vicki.

766
01:06:56,680 --> 01:07:01,101
Asked her if there was anything she knew
about an occult or devil worshippers.

767
01:07:01,143 --> 01:07:02,769
She said no.

768
01:07:02,936 --> 01:07:06,440
But then she said,
"How about I go play detective

769
01:07:07,024 --> 01:07:09,359
"to see what I can find out?"

772
01:07:21,038 --> 01:07:22,622
It's all right.

773
01:07:26,960 --> 01:07:30,464
Do you know that boy, Damien Echols?

774
01:07:31,214 --> 01:07:33,091
Yeah. He's kind of weird.

775
01:07:33,133 --> 01:07:34,134
Mmm.

776
01:07:36,595 --> 01:07:40,098
Well, I really want to meet him.

777
01:07:41,975 --> 01:07:44,311

Thanks, Jessie. I'll see you around.

784

I told Damien that I want
to learn more about Satanism.

785
01:08:14,883 --> 01:08:20,097
And, um, and he invited me to an esbat.

786
01:08:21,723 --> 01:08:23,183
What the hell is that?

787
01:08:23,683 --> 01:08:27,354
I had to look it up. It's a...
It's a gathering of witches.

01:08:28,480 --> 01:08:32,025
It was in an open field, under the full moon.

789
01:08:32,442 --> 01:08:36,279
Damien drove me there in his car,
it was a red Ford Escort.

I'm just telling you what she told me.

About people painted black,

So Vicki's plan failed, right?

810
01:10:00,447 --> 01:10:03,700
Damien gave her nothing.
He never said anything that implicated them.

811
01:10:03,783 --> 01:10:07,746
Yeah, but Vicki's plan got Jessie involved,
which led him right into the lion's den.

in the net just by picking the wrong friend.

to be nothing but pure fantasy.

Ain't nothing but lies.

820

No way they'll let the jury
see how absurd his confabulations are.

821
01:10:30,727 --> 01:10:32,729
So the jury's never gonna hear

822
01:10:32,812 --> 01:10:35,440
from this kid who's been the catalyst
for the entire case.

823
01:10:35,482 --> 01:10:36,942
Oh, but they did hear from him.

824
01:10:36,983 --> 01:10:40,195

manipulations with the tape recorder?

"Nobody knows what happened but me."

826
01:10:46,701 --> 01:10:50,038
They have to use stunts like that,
what else they got?

827
01:10:50,121 --> 01:10:53,583
The State sent 600 items
to the lab and out of all that they got nothing

that directly links Damien,
Jason and Jessie to that crime scene.

829
01:10:58,004 --> 01:10:59,339
Look at this.

830
01:10:59,422 --> 01:11:01,258
Remember how Gitchell told the press

831
01:11:01,341 --> 01:11:04,010
that the case number
ending in 666 was a coincidence?

832
01:11:04,678 --> 01:11:06,888
This police report was
signed by Detective Ridge

833
01:11:06,972 --> 01:11:10,976
three days after our case was assigned,
and the case number ends in 555.

834
01:11:11,601 --> 01:11:15,355
They actually changed our case number
to the number of the beast?

835
01:11:16,564 --> 01:11:18,358
This is a goddamn witch hunt.

836
01:11:18,525 --> 01:11:21,319
Our boys were never suspects in this case.
They were targets.

837
01:11:21,444 --> 01:11:23,780
And once they set their sights
on Jason and Damien,

838
01:11:23,863 --> 01:11:25,031
they stopped looking for anybody else.

839
01:11:25,073 --> 01:11:27,909
But we don't have to. We can keep looking.

840
01:11:27,993 --> 01:11:29,911
Ron, we tried to go through everything,

841
01:11:29,995 --> 01:11:31,705
but they keep sending us mountains of stuff.

842
01:11:31,830 --> 01:11:33,290
Whatever it takes.

843
01:11:34,958 --> 01:11:38,003
We may not be able
to prove our boys didn't do it.

844
01:11:38,044 --> 01:11:41,548
We might be able to prove the cops never
really tried to find out who did.

845
01:11:51,016 --> 01:11:53,393
<i>AARON'. I was there. Don't you see?</i>

846
01:11:53,893 --> 01:11:57,397
<i>And nobody knows what happened but me.</i>

847
01:11:58,648 --> 01:12:01,401
<i>DRIVER: About a year ago Damien told me
that the local devil worshippers</i>

848
01:12:01,443 --> 01:12:06,156
<i>had reached the end of their animal sacrifice
stage. So that summer he said</i>

849
01:12:06,239 --> 01:12:08,533
<i>they were gonna take the next logical step.</i>

850
01:12:08,575 --> 01:12:11,411
<i>Sacrifice a human. A human.</i>

851

<i>POLYGRAPH TECHNICIAN: At any time
Wednesday were you in Robin Hood Woods?</i>

852
01:12:13,997 --> 01:12:14,998
DAMIEN: No.

01:12:15,081 --> 01:12:17,250
<i>Were you present when
those boys were killed?</i>

854
01:12:17,292 --> 01:12:18,293
<i>No.</i>

<i>Do you suspect anyone of
having killed those three boys?</i>

<i>No.</i>

<i>Do you know who killed those three boys?</i>

858
01:12:23,298 --> 01:12:24,299
No.

859
01:12:24,382 --> 01:12:26,760
- Did you kill any of those three boys?
- No.

860
01:12:27,135 --> 01:12:30,096
<i>GLORY. I know, but this crime is unthinkable.</i>

861
01:12:30,263 --> 01:12:33,475
<i>What if they did it? Have you thought of that?</i>

862
01:12:49,032 --> 01:12:51,951
Do you want some dessert?
I have that chocolate pie you like.

863
01:12:52,285 --> 01:12:54,329
No thanks, Annie. I'm fine.

864
01:12:55,080 --> 01:12:57,540
You seemed upset when you
were in here the other day,

865
01:12:57,624 --> 01:13:01,127
having lunch with that lady.
She's really pretty.

866
01:13:03,004 --> 01:13:05,840
- She's my ex-wife.
- Oh.

867
01:13:06,758 --> 01:13:08,968
Not ex for too long, huh?

868
01:13:11,679 --> 01:13:15,183
So you okay lately?
I've been worried about you.

869
01:13:15,683 --> 01:13:17,477
Thanks, Annie, I'm fine.

870
01:13:19,312 --> 01:13:21,564
You know what I'm doing on this case?

871
01:13:24,401 --> 01:13:25,402
Sure, I do.

872
01:13:28,655 --> 01:13:31,324
You understand why I have to help them.

873
01:13:33,827 --> 01:13:37,330
If you don't help those poor boys, who will?

874
01:13:38,706 --> 01:13:43,503
Nobody will. Nobody but you.

875
01:14:26,504 --> 01:14:28,381
Arise and be baptized.

876
01:14:34,512 --> 01:14:39,058
Washing away your sins.
Calling on the name of the Lord.

877
01:14:41,895 --> 01:14:45,398
God will never put more
on you than you can bear.

878
01:15:09,714 --> 01:15:13,760
GRIFFIS: <i>Occult books talk
about the life force of the blood.</i>

879
01:15:14,177 --> 01:15:18,264
Usually the younger the victim,
the more power or force it has.

880
01:15:18,389 --> 01:15:23,686
And do the type of injuries give an
occult overtone to the murders?

881
01:15:23,811 --> 01:15:28,441
Yes. In some occult rituals,
people are over-killed.

882
01:15:29,275 --> 01:15:32,445
The body is repeatedly killed over and over,

883
01:15:32,570 --> 01:15:35,156
with many cuts and blows.

884
01:15:35,448 --> 01:15:40,537
So would you say that this
crime has the trappings of occultism?

885
01:15:41,246 --> 01:15:43,706
Of Satanic worship, in particular.

886
01:15:43,915 --> 01:15:47,669
Dr. Griffis, to get your PhD,
what classes were you required to take?

887
01:15:55,051 --> 01:15:56,719
Uh,none.

888
01:15:57,303 --> 01:16:01,641
And how were you accepted into enrollment
at Columbia Pacific University?

889
01:16:02,725 --> 01:16:07,063
I had to fill out, uh, several series of papers.

890
01:16:09,482 --> 01:16:12,986
Did you have to fill out a little flyer like this?

891
01:16:14,362 --> 01:16:17,699
"Call toll free
for information on how to become a doctor."

892
01:16:18,157 --> 01:16:19,993
This is a mail order college, isn't it?

893
01:16:20,076 --> 01:16:23,162
- University.
- They run a TV ad. Have you seen it?

894
01:16:23,246 --> 01:16:26,541
Yeah, you can send in a request
for what you want your degree in.

895
01:16:26,666 --> 01:16:29,294
Did you know this was a
correspondence school? I didn't.

896
01:16:29,335 --> 01:16:33,423
Judge, the witness has a mail order PhD
from a non-accredited school

897
01:16:33,506 --> 01:16:36,843
that required no classes.
We object to Dr. Griffis as an expert.

898
01:16:37,135 --> 01:16:40,263
Well, I'm not sure within Arkansas
you need a degree of any kind

899
01:16:40,346 --> 01:16:42,807
to be considered an expert
in a particular field.

900
01:16:43,391 --> 01:16:47,854
And I'm not persuaded at all
by your argument about a mail order PhD.

901
01:16:48,229 --> 01:16:54,193
So I'm ruling him as qualified
as an expert in the area of occult.

902
01:17:06,706 --> 01:17:09,459
I'm looking for the manager, Marty King.
Is he here?

903
01:17:09,542 --> 01:17:11,502
He's in the back. I'll fetch him.

904
01:17:17,634 --> 01:17:19,719
Looks like business is pretty good.

905
01:17:19,886 --> 01:17:22,388
A whole lot better than it was
now that they've caught them Satanists

906
01:17:22,430 --> 01:17:23,890
who murdered them little boys.

907
01:17:24,932 --> 01:17:27,060
I'm the manager. What can I do for you?

908
01:17:27,101 --> 01:17:29,062
My name is Ron Lax. I'm an investigator,

909
01:17:29,103 --> 01:17:31,314
and I was wondering if I could
ask you a few questions

910
01:17:31,397 --> 01:17:32,690
about the night of May the 5th?

911
01:17:32,732 --> 01:17:36,069
Well, certainly,
I'll be glad to help out however I can.

912
01:17:37,153 --> 01:17:40,531
Hey, boss.
Here's one I don't remember seeing before.

913
01:17:40,573 --> 01:17:42,825
Who's Christopher Morgan?

914
01:17:43,076 --> 01:17:46,537
Did you in any way participate in
causing the death of any of those three boys?

915
01:17:46,579 --> 01:17:47,914
No.

916
01:17:47,955 --> 01:17:51,084
Do you know for sure
who caused those boys to die?

917
01:17:51,167 --> 01:17:52,543
No.

918
01:17:52,585 --> 01:17:55,505
Are you holding back any information
about those three boys?

919
01:17:55,588 --> 01:17:56,714
No.

920
01:17:56,798 --> 01:17:58,800
The polygraph showed deception.

921
01:17:58,883 --> 01:18:01,928
He says you went off the chart.

922
01:18:02,762 --> 01:18:05,348
I don't know why I failed it.
Must have been nervous.

923
01:18:28,121 --> 01:18:30,123
This is so fucking screwed up!

924
01:18:30,164 --> 01:18:32,583
Chris, I have a legal obligation
to get to the truth...

925
01:18:32,625 --> 01:18:35,962
- I'm telling you the truth.
- Or to exonerate you if you weren't involved.

926
01:18:36,045 --> 01:18:37,588
But based on the polygraph results,

927
01:18:37,630 --> 01:18:39,132
I don't feel like you're being
completely honest.

928
01:18:39,215 --> 01:18:40,800
What do you want me to do?
Do you want me to lie to you?

929
01:18:40,842 --> 01:18:44,137
Okay, I'm gonna lie.
I killed them. And all the other bullshit.

930
01:18:44,512 --> 01:18:47,098
- Are you arresting me?
- No, I am not.

947

My understanding was that
this young man retracted his statement.

We want to question Mr. Morgan to suggest
that the police case was far from certain.

949
01:20:20,900 --> 01:20:22,735
Why would his testimony be relevant?

persons to some event in this case.

a confession suffices as a tie-in?

I'll lie to you and tell you that I did it"?

- Yes.
- Uh-huh.

did you again deny any knowledge

No.

992
01:22:53,678 --> 01:22:56,138
We are entitled to raise reasonable doubt.

993
01:22:56,222 --> 01:22:57,723
That's what we're trying to do
with this testimony.

994
01:22:57,807 --> 01:22:59,725
Raise it or create it?

01:23:00,142 --> 01:23:01,811
FORD: Both!

996
01:23:07,149 --> 01:23:08,234
FORD: Burnett wouldn't let him testify.

997
01:23:08,317 --> 01:23:09,860
GLORI: it was so important
to get that kid on the stand

998
01:23:09,902 --> 01:23:11,737
-to show how arbitrary it's been.
- I know.

999
01:23:11,779 --> 01:23:13,322
But the judge says that's not relevant

1000
01:23:13,406 --> 01:23:15,324
because Morgan told the cops
he was gonna lie.

1001
01:23:15,408 --> 01:23:18,202
Besides, Fogleman says there's
no tape for the part

1002
01:23:18,244 --> 01:23:21,747
-of the interview where Morgan confesses.
- What? No, that's bullshit.

1003
01:23:22,373 --> 01:23:25,418
You can't see part of the tape
because Morgan put a tissue across the lens.

1004
01:23:25,501 --> 01:23:27,878
I saw it. I watched the whole thing.

1005
01:23:28,129 --> 01:23:29,672
But you can see it when he confesses.

1006
01:23:29,755 --> 01:23:31,048
PRICE: Yeah, but Fogleman said...

1007
01:23:31,090 --> 01:23:35,928
The audio's there for all of it, even when the
lens is covered. You tell them that?

1008
01:23:37,388 --> 01:23:39,515
You guys even watch the
entire six hours of tape?

1009
01:23:43,602 --> 01:23:46,439
- We have a synopsis from the Oceanside PD.
- A synopsis?

1010
01:23:47,064 --> 01:23:48,607
Since when do we depend on police reports?

1011
01:23:48,691 --> 01:23:50,943
Ron, we did not have enough time or money.

1012
01:23:50,985 --> 01:23:52,361
But you should have told Burnett...

1013
01:23:52,445 --> 01:23:54,071
I should have told him what?

1014
01:23:56,323 --> 01:24:00,161
Now, you want to try these cases, Ron?
Maybe you should have gone to law school.

1015
01:24:00,870 --> 01:24:04,373
You let us do our job
and you focus on doing yours.

1016
01:24:09,670 --> 01:24:13,466
I'm... I'm sorry, Ron. But we...

1017
01:24:15,009 --> 01:24:16,761
We are overwhelmed.

1018
01:24:17,303 --> 01:24:19,805
Fogleman is burying us in materials.

1019
01:24:19,847 --> 01:24:23,809
13,000 documents from the
police investigation alone.

1020
01:24:23,893 --> 01:24:26,812
We don't have enough time.
We don't have enough manpower. Money.

1021
01:24:26,896 --> 01:24:31,484
And frankly? Burnett?
He's just not giving us a chance.

1029
01:27:03,844 --> 01:27:06,680
Jason, the prosecutor's
office wants to offer you a deal.

1030
01:27:07,431 --> 01:27:09,725
If you agree to testify against Damien,

1031
01:27:09,808 --> 01:27:13,771
they'll only seek a sentence of 20 years.
Not death.

1032
01:27:15,022 --> 01:27:17,650
Now, you could be out
in 10 years, maybe less.

1033
01:27:18,651 --> 01:27:20,653
That's still a long time, though.

1034
01:27:21,737 --> 01:27:24,949
In 10 years you'll be what? 26 years old?

1035
01:27:25,157 --> 01:27:27,785
You'll have your whole life ahead of you.

1036
01:27:30,120 --> 01:27:32,665
The case against you is weak.

1037
01:27:32,748 --> 01:27:36,168
But they're going to do everything they can
to tie you to Damien and his beliefs,

1038
01:27:36,252 --> 01:27:38,087
the things he said and done.

1039
01:27:38,212 --> 01:27:40,756
And despite the lack
of evidence, it is very possible

1040
01:27:40,923 --> 01:27:45,261
that Damien will go down for this.
And if he does,

1041
01:27:45,344 --> 01:27:48,847
there's a good chance he's
gonna drag you down with him.

1042
01:27:53,060 --> 01:27:56,981
I can't do it. I can't tell a lie about him.
It ain't right.

1043
01:28:00,693 --> 01:28:02,278
I can't.

1044
01:28:02,444 --> 01:28:04,822
When you were at the softball field,

1045
01:28:04,947 --> 01:28:08,242
did you hear somebody say
something about the murders?

1046
01:28:08,325 --> 01:28:14,039
Yes, sir. I heard, um, Damien Echols
say that he killed the three boys.

1047
01:28:15,499 --> 01:28:19,003
GIRL: I heard Damien Echols
say he killed all three of those little boys.

1048
01:28:19,461 --> 01:28:24,049
And before he turned himself in,
he was gonna kill two more.

1049
01:28:24,508 --> 01:28:28,012
And he already had one of them picked out.

1050
01:28:30,055 --> 01:28:33,183
Is the person who made that
statement present in this courtroom?

1051
01:28:33,225 --> 01:28:34,393
Yes, sir.

1052
01:28:34,435 --> 01:28:35,811
Would you point that person out for the jury?

1053
01:28:35,894 --> 01:28:37,604
Right there.

1054
01:28:37,813 --> 01:28:41,859
May the record reflect that the witness
has identified Damien Echols.

1055
01:28:42,401 --> 01:28:47,239
If anybody else is in this courtroom, who was
present when that statement was made,

1056
01:28:47,281 --> 01:28:50,534
would you point that person out for the jury?

1057
01:28:53,245 --> 01:28:55,247

1061
01:29:26,612 --> 01:29:28,989

the bodies were found, and, uh,

1064

over and took a report.

morning long in the water and mud."</i>

looked at him, what did you say?

1070
01:30:09,988 --> 01:30:13,492
Um, I said, "Yes, sir."

1071

were muddy and wet up to the knees.

PRICE: Detective Ridge, on May 6th, 1993,

1074
01:30:26,547 --> 01:30:28,340
you went to the Bojangles Restaurant.

1075
01:30:28,424 --> 01:30:32,052
Did you take blood scrapings
from inside the women's restroom?

1076
01:30:32,136 --> 01:30:36,515
Yes, sir. I found trace remains in the
ladies' bathroom of the Bojangles.

1077
01:30:37,975 --> 01:30:43,272
PRICE: Detective, what is the date you sent
the scrapings to the crime lab to be analyzed?

1078
01:30:45,023 --> 01:30:46,775
They were never sent.

1079
01:30:46,942 --> 01:30:51,155
All right. Where are the
samples at this time, Detective?

1080
01:30:51,530 --> 01:30:56,201
I don't know, sir. They were lost.

1081
01:30:56,535 --> 01:30:59,204
PAM: What?
PRICE: You mean blood evidence

1082
01:30:59,705 --> 01:31:05,085
that you took for the purpose
of sending to the crime lab is just lost?

1083
01:31:06,378 --> 01:31:08,172
Yes, sir.

1084
01:31:10,215 --> 01:31:12,885
That's my mistake. I lost a piece of evidence.

1085
01:31:26,023 --> 01:31:31,069
Now, Damien, this book on witchcraft,
where did you get that?

1086
01:31:31,111 --> 01:31:34,698
The library had these books they were
getting rid of for 10 cents each.

1087
01:31:34,990 --> 01:31:38,202
Damien, there's some pages
in there that are underlined in red,

1088
01:31:38,243 --> 01:31:39,786
references to the devil.

1089
01:31:39,870 --> 01:31:41,914
That was already done when I got it.

1090
01:31:41,955 --> 01:31:45,000
I think somebody had a report
to do 'cause all through the book

1091
01:31:45,083 --> 01:31:48,921
there's like little notes,
dates, and stuff like that in the margin.

1092
01:31:49,379 --> 01:31:51,423
Okay.

1093
01:31:55,260 --> 01:31:58,764
Damien, why do you like to wear black?

1094
01:31:59,598 --> 01:32:02,100
I was told I look good in it.

1095
01:32:02,768 --> 01:32:05,437
And it helped me deal with people.

1096
01:32:07,272 --> 01:32:11,693
It would make them think
"He's weird." And it kept them away.

1097
01:32:16,448 --> 01:32:20,494
You've looked into the
Satanic side of the occult, correct?

1098
01:32:21,119 --> 01:32:25,249
- I'm familiar with it.
- You familiar with Aleister Crowley?

1099
01:32:25,499 --> 01:32:30,462
Based on his writings,
he believes in human sacrifice, doesn't he?

1100
01:32:30,504 --> 01:32:33,298
He also believed he was God, so...

1101
01:32:33,382 --> 01:32:38,887
His writings indicated that children
were the best type of human sacrifice.

1102
01:32:39,972 --> 01:32:42,641
- Correct?
- Yes, sir.

1103
01:32:42,808 --> 01:32:46,395
But Crowley has no particular
significance to you?

1104
01:32:47,104 --> 01:32:51,775
I know who he is. I've read about him,
but I've never read anything by him.

01:33:02,452 --> 01:33:03,996
What is that?

1107
01:33:06,248 --> 01:33:09,459
It's a paper I had on different alphabets.

1108
01:33:10,085 --> 01:33:12,421
Where you could write
things nobody could read.

1109
01:33:12,504 --> 01:33:14,840

01:33:15,007 --> 01:33:17,676

Now, when he interviewed you
before your arrest, did you tell Officer Ridge

1117
01:33:44,745 --> 01:33:47,581
that you'd been a member
of a white witch group for five years?

1118
01:33:47,664 --> 01:33:50,167
I told him I was a Wiccan.
I've never been a member of a group.

1119
01:33:50,208 --> 01:33:52,377
- Oh, he made that up?
- Yes.

1120
01:33:52,461 --> 01:33:56,506
Officer Ridge also asked you
why would someone kill these kids

1121
01:33:56,548 --> 01:34:01,261
and your response was that the person
was sick or a Satanist. Is that correct?

1122
01:34:01,762 --> 01:34:07,100
He asked me was it possible if they could be
Satanists, and I said "Yeah, I guess."

1123
01:34:07,184 --> 01:34:12,564
When Officer Ridge asked you how do you
think the person feels who did this,

1124
01:34:13,398 --> 01:34:18,236
your answer was,
"Probably makes them feel good.

1125
01:34:18,904 --> 01:34:21,031
"Gives them power."

1126
01:34:22,115 --> 01:34:25,619
Is that correct?
Or, I guess, Officer Ridge made that up, too.

1127
01:34:25,702 --> 01:34:28,246
No. I used common sense on that.

1128
01:34:28,330 --> 01:34:31,083
If someone was doing it,
they must have wanted to.

1129
01:34:31,124 --> 01:34:35,379
And if they were doing something they
wanted to it must make them happy.

1130
01:34:35,420 --> 01:34:39,758
So in your mind it is common sense

1131
01:34:39,800 --> 01:34:43,470
that killing three eight-year-olds
would make you feel good?

1132
01:34:45,222 --> 01:34:47,265
Whoever did it must have.

it proves that these

01:36:09,055 --> 01:36:12,476
And when you look at it all together,

1153
01:36:12,517 --> 01:36:16,021
you begin to see inside Damien Echols.

1154
01:36:17,814 --> 01:36:22,694
You see inside that person. You look inside,

1155
01:36:25,572 --> 01:36:27,908
and there's not a soul in there.

1156
01:36:49,179 --> 01:36:51,473
The first verdict reads as follows.

1157
01:36:53,433 --> 01:36:55,769
"We, the jury, find Damien Echols

1158
01:36:55,894 --> 01:36:57,103

01:37:18,583 --> 01:37:21,211
No!No!No!

"We, the jury, find Jason Baldwin

"guilty of capital murder

1171
01:37:51,783 --> 01:37:55,287
Now, do either of you have any
legal reason to give the court

1172
01:37:55,328 --> 01:37:58,164
as to why a sentence should not be imposed?

1173
01:37:59,791 --> 01:38:01,418
No, sir.

1174
01:38:02,878 --> 01:38:04,629
'Cause I'm innocent.

1175
01:38:05,297 --> 01:38:07,340
Pardon, I'm sorry, I didn't hear that.

1176
01:38:07,632 --> 01:38:09,718
Because I'm innocent.

1177
01:38:11,720 --> 01:38:14,806
Well, the jury has heard the
evidence and concluded otherwise.

1178
01:38:15,640 --> 01:38:21,813
Mr. Baldwin, you are hereby adjudicated
guilty on three counts of capital murder.

1179

You are hereby sentenced
to the Arkansas Department of Corrections

to a term of life
without the possibility of parole.

1181
01:38:32,365 --> 01:38:36,453
Mr. Echols, you have been
adjudicated guilty on three counts

1182
01:38:36,494 --> 01:38:38,830
of capital murder as well,

You are remanded to the

and to immediately be transported to the

Mrs. Hobbs.

01:40:23,309 --> 01:40:24,811
I'm Ron Lax.

1195
01:40:25,478 --> 01:40:27,105
I know who you are.

1196
01:40:37,240 --> 01:40:42,203
And I don't hate you either.
Or them lawyers. Just don't forget about us.

1197
01:40:42,579 --> 01:40:46,666
- Don't... Don't let yourself forget about us.
- I won't.

1198
01:40:47,959 --> 01:40:49,294
I can't.

1199
01:40:51,588 --> 01:40:55,967
Ever since I saw your face on TV that first day,

1200
01:40:56,051 --> 01:40:58,344
I read the case files,

1201
01:41:02,390 --> 01:41:04,934
saw the photographs of your son.

1202
01:41:07,687 --> 01:41:09,981
I'll never be able to forget any of it.

1203
01:41:13,818 --> 01:41:18,364
And I know that you may not be
able to feel much compassion right now

1204
01:41:18,448 --> 01:41:22,327
for the boys accused of this crime.
I understand that, I really do.

1205
01:41:24,662 --> 01:41:28,875
But if these boys are innocent,

1206
01:41:28,958 --> 01:41:32,295
would you want three more families
to lose their children, too?

1207
01:41:34,798 --> 01:41:39,177
I found this in Terry's things.

1208
01:41:42,138 --> 01:41:44,349
It's Stevie's pocket knife.

1209
01:41:46,017 --> 01:41:47,936
His Grandpa Hicks gave him.

1210
01:41:48,228 --> 01:41:51,731
- Your father?
- Yeah, my father.

1211
01:41:52,190 --> 01:41:54,025
Stevie loved this knife.

1212
01:41:54,526 --> 01:41:58,196
Just like his new bike.
Everything his grandpa ever gave him.

1213
01:42:01,574 --> 01:42:05,078
He'd take it with him everywhere.
He always had it.

1214
01:42:06,830 --> 01:42:10,583
- I think he would have had it that day.
- The day he was killed?

1215
01:42:11,376 --> 01:42:13,920
I don't know why they didn't find it on him.

1216
01:42:15,171 --> 01:42:18,049
And I don't know why my
husband would have it now.

1217
01:42:18,633 --> 01:42:21,678
You suspect your husband
might have something do to with all of this?

1218
01:42:21,761 --> 01:42:25,807
I don't know. I don't know.

1219
01:42:28,560 --> 01:42:31,563
I don't know anything anymore.

1220
01:42:32,438 --> 01:42:36,734
After hearing Jessie's confession,

1221
01:42:36,776 --> 01:42:41,406
and all those things he didn't know

1222
01:42:41,447 --> 01:42:45,493
and the bloody man at Bojangles,

1223
01:42:45,577 --> 01:42:48,413
and Mark Byers and that bloody knife.

1224
01:42:49,247 --> 01:42:51,082
And those girls up on the stand,

1225
01:42:51,166 --> 01:42:54,294
acting like this is all just
some sort of game to them.

1226
01:42:55,920 --> 01:43:00,466
And what about Chris Morgan? They told me
that he confessed out in California,

1227
01:43:00,550 --> 01:43:04,053
and they wouldn't even let us hear
what he had to say on the stand.

1228
01:43:05,180 --> 01:43:10,685
It seems like everybody,
the police, the judge, everybody,

1229
01:43:10,768 --> 01:43:14,272
they all know who they want to think did this.

1230
01:43:16,774 --> 01:43:18,568
I don't know anymore.

1231
01:43:21,321 --> 01:43:22,739
Neither do I.

1232
01:43:27,452 --> 01:43:32,707
But I know in my heart that
Damien, Jason and Jessie did not do this.

1233
01:44:03,154 --> 01:44:08,618
<i>STEVIE: Well that's all right, Mama
That's all right for you</i>

1234

<i>That's all right, Mama
Just any way you do</i>

1235
01:44:13,665 --> 01:44:14,666
<i>That's all right</i>

1236
01:44:35,019 --> 01:44:39,732
Is that too tight? You'll be back soon.

1237
01:44:39,857 --> 01:44:43,361
Real soon, sweetheart. I promise.
