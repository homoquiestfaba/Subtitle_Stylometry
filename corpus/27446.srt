1
00:02:16,013 --> 00:02:17,913
[Man]
You just get out of here!

2
00:02:18,015 --> 00:02:20,916
Oh, please!
I beg of you!

3
00:02:22,153 --> 00:02:24,053
That won't hold up.

4
00:02:24,155 --> 00:02:27,556
That's no good. You can throw
that right away. Start again.

5
00:02:31,362 --> 00:02:33,421
Easy!

6
00:02:45,876 --> 00:02:48,276
You're bloody drinkin'
all our money again!

7
00:02:48,379 --> 00:02:51,280
- I'll kick your bleedin' ass!
- All our bloody savings!

8
00:02:51,382 --> 00:02:53,282
What do you say, darling?

9
00:02:53,384 --> 00:02:56,285
Gonna have a hell of a holiday
identifying that!

10
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:04,460
You needn't fear.

11
00:03:04,562 --> 00:03:07,463
That's it. You'll feel
better when you get to--

12
00:03:11,402 --> 00:03:13,302
We warned you!

13
00:03:13,404 --> 00:03:15,304
- What is this?

14
00:03:15,406 --> 00:03:18,307
This'll be
the last warning you get!

15
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:25,080
- Good night, Polly.
- Gonna be a long night, Mary.

16
00:03:25,182 --> 00:03:27,082
Too bloody long.

17
00:03:33,023 --> 00:03:35,423
- It's quiet, isn't it?
- Like the devil's laugh.

18
00:03:35,526 --> 00:03:38,427
- You had any luck?
- No, not very much.

19
00:03:46,036 --> 00:03:48,937
- A penny for a suck.
- Piss off.

20
00:03:50,875 --> 00:03:52,775
- Where's Kate?
- Across the street.

21
00:03:54,044 --> 00:03:55,944
Take it easy, now.

22
00:03:56,046 --> 00:03:57,946
Here we are.

23
00:03:58,048 --> 00:04:00,414
Slow down.

24
00:04:00,517 --> 00:04:03,748
- Miss? Mary, isn't it?
- Yeah? What do you want?

25
00:04:03,854 --> 00:04:05,378
Shut your hole, bitch.

26
00:04:05,489 --> 00:04:08,981
I know you.
You're Geordie from Nichol Street.

27
00:04:09,093 --> 00:04:11,857
Do you remember me, Mary Kelly?

28
00:04:11,962 --> 00:04:13,987
I'd never forget you, McQueen.

29
00:04:17,034 --> 00:04:19,366
You stop that now.
Buttons are hard to come by.

30
00:04:21,672 --> 00:04:23,697
What does a whore
need buttons for?

31
00:04:23,807 --> 00:04:28,608
I warned you and your friends
payment was expected Monday.

32
00:04:28,712 --> 00:04:31,704
I'm working, ain't l?
We all are.

33
00:04:32,917 --> 00:04:35,613
And l... am makin' sure...

34
00:04:35,719 --> 00:04:39,211
that no one troubles you.

35
00:04:39,323 --> 00:04:41,723
I'm providing a service, Mary Kelly...

36
00:04:41,825 --> 00:04:43,850
and I expect to be paid.

37
00:04:43,961 --> 00:04:47,397
Or else you will be
very troubled.

38
00:04:47,498 --> 00:04:49,523
Now, you tell...

39
00:04:50,401 --> 00:04:52,596
your five friends...

40
00:04:54,238 --> 00:04:56,900
to bring me my money
by tomorrow...

41
00:04:57,007 --> 00:05:00,773
or this friend ofmine here
will be your next customer.

42
00:05:34,111 --> 00:05:37,103
- It's gotten hard for me, and then--
- Oh, God.

43
00:05:37,214 --> 00:05:40,479
- You're bloody filthy this morning.
- I bleedin' stink.

44
00:05:40,584 --> 00:05:42,484
What'd you get up to
last night?

45
00:05:42,586 --> 00:05:45,487
You don't wanna know about it.

46
00:05:45,589 --> 00:05:47,614
Give us a look.

47
00:05:54,598 --> 00:05:56,691
Mary!

48
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:59,633
Oh, thank God I found you.

49
00:05:59,737 --> 00:06:02,035
He's comin'.
Albert's comin' today.

50
00:06:02,139 --> 00:06:04,630
And, well, I need you
to look after the baby.

51
00:06:05,976 --> 00:06:08,206
Let's have a hold.
Ohh!

52
00:06:08,312 --> 00:06:10,940
I'm so proud ofher.
I love her to bits.

53
00:06:11,048 --> 00:06:13,039
She's the most gorgeous
little girl.

54
00:06:13,150 --> 00:06:15,846
-lsn't she beautiful?
-She's so beautiful.

55
00:06:15,953 --> 00:06:17,853
She's lovely, isn't she?

56
00:06:17,955 --> 00:06:19,820
I'll be seein' you in a bit.

57
00:06:19,923 --> 00:06:21,823
Get us ajar of gin, will ya?

58
00:06:21,925 --> 00:06:24,485
- Looks like me as well.
- You look fine, Ann.

59
00:06:24,595 --> 00:06:27,860
Must be nice havin'
a rich man lookin' after ya.

60
00:06:27,965 --> 00:06:31,128
She has your eyes and her father's brow.
Don't you think?

61
00:06:31,235 --> 00:06:33,635
- Oh, yeah.
- Yeah.

62
00:06:33,737 --> 00:06:37,639
She is a perfect love. But, Ann,
we're all in a terrible way for money.

63
00:06:37,741 --> 00:06:40,141
- The Nichols gang--
- They want our blood.

64
00:06:40,244 --> 00:06:43,008
- Know what they said they're gonna do?
- Don't start that now.

65
00:06:43,113 --> 00:06:44,842
Or what?
What's she saying?

66
00:06:44,948 --> 00:06:47,348
They want a pound a week
from each of us.

67
00:06:47,451 --> 00:06:52,514
You count your self lucky that you got
a wealthy man to take care of ya.

68
00:06:52,623 --> 00:06:56,650
We're needing four pound to pay him,
so I can't spare the time.

69
00:06:56,760 --> 00:07:00,093
I'll get you the four pounds
from Albert.

70
00:07:00,197 --> 00:07:03,098
- He might say no.
- He won't.

71
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:05,100
I know he won't.

72
00:07:05,202 --> 00:07:07,602
He's been in France on business.

73
00:07:07,704 --> 00:07:10,104
He wrote he sold
a lot ofhis paintings.

74
00:07:10,207 --> 00:07:13,108
He's sure to have full pockets
and feel generous.

75
00:07:13,210 --> 00:07:15,269
- To you, perhaps, but--
- I'll ask for meself.

76
00:07:15,379 --> 00:07:19,042
I'll get you the four pounds.
I promise, Mary.

77
00:07:28,826 --> 00:07:31,727
I'm not gonna hurt you, Netley.

78
00:07:31,829 --> 00:07:33,729
Remember me?

79
00:07:33,831 --> 00:07:35,731
Remember who I am?

80
00:07:37,167 --> 00:07:40,068
Your charge will be coming down
sooner than expected.

81
00:07:40,170 --> 00:07:43,071
Much sooner than expected.

82
00:07:43,173 --> 00:07:46,074
Be a good man, Netley.
Get him home quickly.

83
00:07:46,176 --> 00:07:49,236
Quickly and quietly.
Understood?

84
00:07:52,116 --> 00:07:54,016
Well said, Netley.

85
00:07:54,118 --> 00:07:57,019
Very well said.

86
00:08:36,059 --> 00:08:38,857
- Take them out.
- What is the meaning of this?

87
00:08:38,962 --> 00:08:43,365
- Kidney, what are you doing?
- Ohh! Albert! Aaah!

88
00:08:43,467 --> 00:08:45,628
Albert!
My baby!

89
00:08:45,736 --> 00:08:48,637
- I want this room in pieces.

90
00:08:48,739 --> 00:08:52,971
Oh, no! No!

91
00:08:54,344 --> 00:08:56,676
Release me at once!

92
00:08:56,780 --> 00:08:58,509
- I demandan explanation!
- It's Albert.

93
00:09:00,918 --> 00:09:02,545
Go!

94
00:09:04,922 --> 00:09:08,119
- Albert! Aaah!

95
00:09:08,225 --> 00:09:10,318
- Get off me! Get off me!

96
00:09:10,427 --> 00:09:12,122
Shh, shh, shh.

97
00:09:12,229 --> 00:09:14,129
- Please, no!
- Go!

98
00:09:14,231 --> 00:09:17,792
Get off!.

99
00:09:19,770 --> 00:09:21,670
Who knows?

100
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:25,873
I didn't know.

101
00:09:25,976 --> 00:09:27,876
I swear I didn't.

102
00:09:27,978 --> 00:09:30,378
How could I tell anyone else?

103
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:32,380
Tsk, tsk, tsk.

104
00:09:32,482 --> 00:09:34,382
Who knows?

105
00:09:38,388 --> 00:09:40,288
Who knows?

106
00:09:45,229 --> 00:09:48,289
I don't know.
I don't know who they could be.

107
00:09:48,398 --> 00:09:50,923
Albert must have mixed in
with something terrible.

108
00:09:51,034 --> 00:09:53,969
- She's hungry and cold, poor thing.

109
00:09:56,073 --> 00:10:00,237
I've got to take her to 'em.
I've got to take her to Ann's parents.

110
00:10:00,344 --> 00:10:03,404
All right, you go.
Leave Baby Alice with them.

111
00:10:03,513 --> 00:10:06,448
I'll get to work, and I'll
meet you later at the Ten Bells.

112
00:11:43,613 --> 00:11:45,342
Mostly Jews live here.

113
00:12:05,469 --> 00:12:07,869
Notice something, lnspector?

114
00:12:22,986 --> 00:12:25,887
I paid.
I already paid.

115
00:12:25,989 --> 00:12:28,890
I'm not after you, Emperor.
Where is he?

116
00:12:30,961 --> 00:12:32,861
Move it!

117
00:12:32,963 --> 00:12:35,329
Hey!

118
00:12:40,303 --> 00:12:43,670
Get up.

119
00:12:45,809 --> 00:12:47,709
Get up!

120
00:12:50,514 --> 00:12:52,414
Hello, darling.

121
00:13:07,831 --> 00:13:09,731
Sergeant.

122
00:13:11,835 --> 00:13:13,735
It's night.

123
00:13:13,837 --> 00:13:17,238
Well spotted, lnspector Abberline.
Indeed, it is night.

124
00:13:17,340 --> 00:13:19,240
The genius has returned to us.

125
00:13:19,342 --> 00:13:21,242
Thank you, gentlemen, and remember...

126
00:13:21,344 --> 00:13:25,303
if you ever wish to escape the dreary
confines of your present duties...

127
00:13:25,415 --> 00:13:27,315
this never happened.

128
00:13:27,417 --> 00:13:29,317
Cut along, now.

129
00:13:31,521 --> 00:13:33,421
Have I lost a day?

130
00:13:33,523 --> 00:13:36,424
No, lnspector. Indeed, it's only
four hours since you left here.

131
00:13:36,526 --> 00:13:40,963
Oh, deepest apologies
for the, uh, rude awakening.

132
00:13:41,064 --> 00:13:43,498
I suspect you enjoyed that.

133
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:46,501
I must be cruel only to be kind,
as the poet said.

134
00:13:46,603 --> 00:13:50,266
Although I would happily wallop you
every time you chased the dragon.

135
00:13:50,373 --> 00:13:53,274
Well, I had a sneaking suspicion
you might interrupt.

136
00:13:53,376 --> 00:13:55,936
You've seen something.

137
00:13:56,046 --> 00:13:58,446
What did you see?

138
00:14:00,484 --> 00:14:02,975
Are her petticoats
saturated with blood?

139
00:14:04,554 --> 00:14:07,455
You know, they used to
burn men like you alive.

140
00:14:09,025 --> 00:14:12,017
Sometime this evening a bang-tail
was murdered in George Yard.

141
00:14:12,128 --> 00:14:15,120
That doesn't sound much
out of the ordinary.

142
00:14:15,232 --> 00:14:17,132
'Twas the way she was done,
lnspector.

143
00:14:17,234 --> 00:14:19,600
'Twas the way
the bang-tail was done...

144
00:14:19,703 --> 00:14:22,604
that cries out
for a man of your talents.

145
00:14:32,349 --> 00:14:36,080
Her name was Martha Tabram. I don't
know what sort of name Tabram is.

146
00:14:37,687 --> 00:14:40,212
It sounds foreign to me.

147
00:14:40,323 --> 00:14:42,723
This is not what I saw.

148
00:14:42,826 --> 00:14:45,590
Not the woman of your dreams?

149
00:14:45,695 --> 00:14:47,754
- You sure?
- Yeah.

150
00:14:49,332 --> 00:14:51,527
- Show him.
- You show him.

151
00:14:51,635 --> 00:14:55,901
Why do l have to be exposed to this
degradation over and over again?

152
00:14:57,741 --> 00:14:59,902
I've looked at the mess twice!

153
00:15:04,481 --> 00:15:07,882
Before he cut
her throat, he removed her livelihood...

154
00:15:07,984 --> 00:15:09,884
as a keepsake.

155
00:15:19,696 --> 00:15:23,097
Gentlemen, we are indeed
fortunate today...

156
00:15:23,199 --> 00:15:26,100
to be able to observe
an entirely new approach...

157
00:15:26,202 --> 00:15:28,932
to the treatment of insanity.

158
00:15:29,039 --> 00:15:31,030
It is-- Oh, Dr. Ferral.

159
00:15:31,141 --> 00:15:35,043
I was just saying, we're here
in the hope that you will permit us...

160
00:15:35,145 --> 00:15:37,045
to observe
this new treatment of yours.

161
00:15:37,147 --> 00:15:40,378
Well, I wasn't expecting such
distinguished visitors, Sir William.

162
00:15:40,483 --> 00:15:43,008
But you're all welcome, of course.

163
00:15:43,119 --> 00:15:44,848
I'm ready to begin right now.

164
00:15:44,955 --> 00:15:47,355
- Who is your patient?
- Ann Crook.

165
00:15:47,457 --> 00:15:49,857
An unfortunate, Sir William...

166
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:52,360
who's hysterical and violent...

167
00:15:52,462 --> 00:15:54,896
and has severe delusions
of persecution.

168
00:15:54,998 --> 00:15:58,263
Oh, poor girl.
Uh, do please proceed, Dr. Ferral.

169
00:15:59,469 --> 00:16:02,233
Gentlemen.

170
00:16:50,053 --> 00:16:52,487
We have one tap above...

171
00:16:56,593 --> 00:16:58,618
and one into the left lobe...

172
00:17:02,432 --> 00:17:04,127
and...

173
00:17:04,234 --> 00:17:06,134
one on the right...

174
00:17:07,370 --> 00:17:10,567
and this unlucky patient's dementia...

175
00:17:10,674 --> 00:17:12,699
will no longer takea violent form.

176
00:17:12,809 --> 00:17:16,210
Thanks to this simple procedure...

177
00:17:16,312 --> 00:17:20,043
we can now permanently alleviate
the poor girl's suffering.

178
00:17:25,755 --> 00:17:29,156
What could I do? I had to
leave the baby with Ann's parents.

179
00:17:29,259 --> 00:17:31,159
Rich man. Thought he was
gonna take care of Ann.

180
00:17:31,261 --> 00:17:34,162
Knew that was
too bloody good to be true.

181
00:17:34,264 --> 00:17:36,664
They're gonna kill
every one of us.

182
00:17:36,766 --> 00:17:39,166
Who is this Albert, anyway?
Who is he?

183
00:17:39,269 --> 00:17:42,705
Oh, for God's sake, who cares
about Albert and Ann's troubles?

184
00:17:42,806 --> 00:17:46,833
What are we gonna do? We can't
stay clear of the Nichols boys forever.

185
00:17:46,943 --> 00:17:49,844
You know, they say
they held poor Martha down...

186
00:17:49,946 --> 00:17:53,848
and watched her bleed until she
passed out, and then cut her throat.

187
00:17:53,950 --> 00:17:56,475
- Oh! Shocking.
- McQueen is mad.

188
00:17:56,586 --> 00:17:58,486
He enjoys hurting women.

189
00:17:58,588 --> 00:18:02,422
That's insane. They want four pounds.
How we gonna get four pounds?

190
00:18:02,525 --> 00:18:05,722
Not with my old cunny.
I'd be lucky to get four pence.

191
00:18:07,030 --> 00:18:09,931
Oi, oi, oi!
Behave yourselves or bugger off!.

192
00:18:10,033 --> 00:18:11,933
Yeah, you can bugger off..

193
00:18:12,035 --> 00:18:14,401
We work, girls.

194
00:18:14,504 --> 00:18:17,405
We work the streets
harder than ever.

195
00:18:17,507 --> 00:18:20,101
Right? Right?

196
00:18:22,212 --> 00:18:25,113
All right, we can do it here.
But hurry up.

197
00:18:25,215 --> 00:18:27,115
The bobbies are fussing us tonight.

198
00:18:27,217 --> 00:18:30,118
All right. Gotta get
the old man off first, right?

199
00:18:30,220 --> 00:18:33,121
- Give it here. I'll put it in meself.
- Oh, that's ni--

200
00:18:33,223 --> 00:18:35,123
Ooh!

201
00:18:35,225 --> 00:18:37,125
- Eh?
- Yeah, yeah.

202
00:18:37,227 --> 00:18:39,627
- Is it in?
- Of course it is. Come on.

203
00:18:39,729 --> 00:18:42,630
No, it's not. You got it
stuck between your bleedin' legs.

204
00:18:42,732 --> 00:18:46,133
- No, I haven't. Come on, get a move on.
- I knows it when I feels it.

205
00:18:57,981 --> 00:19:00,882
- Oh!
- That's mine, Polly.

206
00:19:00,984 --> 00:19:03,578
That's my money.

207
00:19:07,390 --> 00:19:09,881
I could pop your eye out.

208
00:19:09,993 --> 00:19:11,483
Customers wouldn't mind.

209
00:19:11,594 --> 00:19:15,394
They don't mind
if a whore can't see.

210
00:19:16,733 --> 00:19:18,633
- What's that?

211
00:19:18,735 --> 00:19:20,794
What have I got here?

212
00:19:20,904 --> 00:19:23,566
What have I got here, Constable?
Only a little thing.

213
00:19:23,673 --> 00:19:27,074
Only a little thing to you,
but a great thing to me.

214
00:19:27,177 --> 00:19:30,408
Move, or l'll bash
that smart mouth.

215
00:19:32,382 --> 00:19:34,282
You're a dead woman.

216
00:19:42,525 --> 00:19:45,926
- He won't bother you again tonight.
- Yeah, that's right.

217
00:19:46,029 --> 00:19:48,930
Look, one for the Nichols. Yeah?

218
00:19:49,032 --> 00:19:51,762
- And one for me. Right?

219
00:19:51,868 --> 00:19:53,927
Oh. Come here. Come here.

220
00:19:54,037 --> 00:19:56,232
Hey. Shh.

221
00:19:56,339 --> 00:19:58,569
Hey, we work the streets together.

222
00:19:58,675 --> 00:20:01,075
I'll keep my eye on you, love, eh?

223
00:20:06,182 --> 00:20:08,241
Oh, you pig !

224
00:20:08,351 --> 00:20:10,251
You disgusting pig !

225
00:20:13,423 --> 00:20:15,482
Yeah, I'm a pig.

226
00:20:15,592 --> 00:20:18,493
I'm what's wrong with the world.

227
00:20:18,595 --> 00:20:20,495
Be on your own, then.

228
00:20:20,597 --> 00:20:22,827
Oh, no!

229
00:20:22,932 --> 00:20:25,833
You don't want the company of a pig!

230
00:20:27,136 --> 00:20:29,536
What the fuck are you lookin' at?

231
00:20:29,639 --> 00:20:31,539
I slept with you!

232
00:20:46,389 --> 00:20:48,289
Thirsty?

233
00:20:48,391 --> 00:20:50,291
Mmm.

234
00:20:53,396 --> 00:20:56,297
That was the thing
that was in my dream.

235
00:20:56,399 --> 00:20:58,299
What's it called again?

236
00:20:58,401 --> 00:21:00,528
Cleopatra's Needle.

237
00:21:00,637 --> 00:21:02,537
Mmm. Cleopatra.

238
00:21:02,639 --> 00:21:04,539
She was a beauty, wasn't she?

239
00:21:04,641 --> 00:21:10,238
It was carved 1 ,500 years
before the Son of God was born.

240
00:21:10,346 --> 00:21:12,246
Mmm.

241
00:21:12,348 --> 00:21:15,249
Six men died to bring it here...

242
00:21:15,351 --> 00:21:17,251
from Egypt.

243
00:22:19,482 --> 00:22:22,383
May the Good Lord have mercy.

244
00:22:35,732 --> 00:22:38,633
She was like that when I found her--
all murdered.

245
00:22:38,735 --> 00:22:41,636
What kind of monster did this?

246
00:22:41,738 --> 00:22:44,639
- Woman, I told you.
- Who was the first to see her?

247
00:22:47,276 --> 00:22:51,406
You go in. Keep to the streets.
Settle back, now.

248
00:22:53,316 --> 00:22:56,012
The boys have made their rounds of the
taverns and the delightful domiciles...

249
00:22:56,119 --> 00:22:58,849
that make up
this charming little street.

250
00:22:58,955 --> 00:23:01,321
Would it surprise you to learn
that nobody heard a sound?

251
00:23:01,424 --> 00:23:04,655
Throat was cut, but there's
no arterial spray on the wall.

252
00:23:04,761 --> 00:23:07,559
She was killed somewhere else.

253
00:23:11,601 --> 00:23:14,399
- It rained last night, didn't it?
- Mm-hmm.

254
00:23:16,739 --> 00:23:18,639
She's dry.

255
00:23:19,942 --> 00:23:22,502
She was brought here
in a carriage or something.

256
00:23:22,612 --> 00:23:25,012
Throat must have been cut
in the carriage.

257
00:23:25,114 --> 00:23:27,309
I imagine they stopped it
just over there.

258
00:23:27,417 --> 00:23:28,618
"They" ?

259
00:23:28,618 --> 00:23:29,550
"They" ?

260
00:23:29,652 --> 00:23:33,349
- There's more than one, then.
- Most definitely.

261
00:23:34,557 --> 00:23:36,650
This was all in your vision?

262
00:23:36,759 --> 00:23:39,592
-Take your missus home.

263
00:23:39,695 --> 00:23:42,027
Where were the coppers last night?

264
00:23:42,131 --> 00:23:44,326
Oh, Jesus.

265
00:23:44,434 --> 00:23:46,834
So...

266
00:23:46,936 --> 00:23:48,836
definitely more than one person.

267
00:23:48,938 --> 00:23:51,839
Has to be a message from
the Nichols boys. Am l right?

268
00:23:54,310 --> 00:23:56,107
What the hell?

269
00:23:56,212 --> 00:23:58,180
That's grapes, isn't it?

270
00:23:58,281 --> 00:24:01,546
What the hell would a bang-tail
be doing with grapes?

271
00:24:45,828 --> 00:24:48,729
I'd like to give them an answer.

272
00:24:48,831 --> 00:24:51,231
- What are you talking about?
- The Nichols boys.

273
00:24:51,334 --> 00:24:53,234
I would welcome the opportunity...

274
00:24:53,336 --> 00:24:56,237
to give them an answer
to their bloody message.

275
00:24:56,339 --> 00:24:58,739
There is most definitely
a message here.

276
00:24:58,841 --> 00:25:01,674
- You're right about that.
- And what am I wrong about?

277
00:25:03,412 --> 00:25:07,781
Martha Tabram was raped,
tortured and killed.

278
00:25:07,884 --> 00:25:09,784
That's cruel.

279
00:25:09,886 --> 00:25:12,787
But I've seen that sort of cruelty
in the East End before.

280
00:25:14,557 --> 00:25:17,117
This is methodical.

281
00:25:17,226 --> 00:25:19,126
The butchery's irrational...

282
00:25:19,228 --> 00:25:21,628
yet meticulous and deliberate.

283
00:25:24,834 --> 00:25:27,234
Altogether a different
breed of killer.

284
00:25:29,705 --> 00:25:32,606
As soon as possible
I'd like to know what he took.

285
00:25:32,708 --> 00:25:35,973
What? What do you mean,
what he took?

286
00:25:36,078 --> 00:25:38,979
- Didn't you notice?
- What?

287
00:25:39,081 --> 00:25:41,481
He's taken at least one
ofher organs.

288
00:25:41,584 --> 00:25:43,484
Oh, no.

289
00:25:51,027 --> 00:25:54,588
I want every veterinarian,
butcher...

290
00:25:54,697 --> 00:25:57,598
and furrier in the district
interviewed.

291
00:25:57,700 --> 00:26:00,191
Furrier? What did he do, sir?
Skin her?

292
00:26:00,303 --> 00:26:03,033
- Pipe down, Withers.

293
00:26:03,139 --> 00:26:07,041
When the inspector is talking,
you are listening. Do you understand?

294
00:26:07,143 --> 00:26:09,134
Yes, Sergeant.

295
00:26:09,245 --> 00:26:12,146
He disemboweled her.

296
00:26:12,248 --> 00:26:15,649
After he cut her throat,
he stabbed her in the chest...

297
00:26:15,751 --> 00:26:17,651
cut open her stomach...

298
00:26:17,753 --> 00:26:20,085
and, uh, took out her intestines.

299
00:26:23,426 --> 00:26:26,486
At least one
ofher organs was removed.

300
00:26:26,596 --> 00:26:29,997
I'm waiting for the police surgeon's
report for more details.

301
00:26:33,102 --> 00:26:34,694
I see.

302
00:26:35,972 --> 00:26:37,872
Well, one thing's for certain:

303
00:26:37,974 --> 00:26:39,771
an Englishman didn't do it.

304
00:26:42,545 --> 00:26:46,709
Maybe one ofthese red lndians...

305
00:26:46,816 --> 00:26:50,616
wandered into Whitechapel
and indulged his natural inclinations.

306
00:26:53,422 --> 00:26:55,549
With all due respect, sir...

307
00:26:55,658 --> 00:26:57,558
I believe this was done by someone...

308
00:26:57,660 --> 00:26:59,958
with at least
a working knowledge of dissection.

309
00:27:00,062 --> 00:27:02,963
- An educated man, such as a doctor--
- An educated man?

310
00:27:03,065 --> 00:27:06,432
That's preposterous.
No well-bred man would do this.

311
00:27:07,770 --> 00:27:10,204
Probably a tradesman or a butcher.

312
00:27:10,306 --> 00:27:13,673
A tradesman is
a possibility, sir, yes.

313
00:27:14,877 --> 00:27:17,812
But there's a strong
indication against it.

314
00:27:17,913 --> 00:27:20,381
There was a sprig of grapes
found under her body.

315
00:27:20,483 --> 00:27:21,882
What are you driving at?

316
00:27:21,984 --> 00:27:26,114
No one in White chapel,
no matter what their trade...

317
00:27:26,222 --> 00:27:27,883
could afford grapes.

318
00:27:27,990 --> 00:27:30,254
Obviously they were
given to herby the killer.

319
00:27:30,359 --> 00:27:33,556
And it follows that
he must be someone with money.

320
00:27:33,663 --> 00:27:37,292
What about the Jews?
A Jew butcher.

321
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:40,062
Or a Jew tailor
might have money.

322
00:27:40,169 --> 00:27:42,069
There are plenty of them
in Whitechapel.

323
00:27:42,171 --> 00:27:45,470
Well, sir, for the sake
of public safety in general...

324
00:27:45,574 --> 00:27:49,476
I'd like to be careful about spreading
the rumors that it might be a Jew.

325
00:27:50,846 --> 00:27:52,746
Inspector, I know your reputation...

326
00:27:52,848 --> 00:27:55,749
for making brilliant guesses
that turn out to be right.

327
00:27:55,851 --> 00:27:59,446
Someone told me you claimed
to dream the answers.

328
00:27:59,555 --> 00:28:03,013
Frankly, it doesn't matter to me
what your methods are.

329
00:28:03,125 --> 00:28:06,253
But be certain you don't
proceed without proof.

330
00:28:06,362 --> 00:28:08,523
- Is that clear?
- Of course, sir.

331
00:28:08,631 --> 00:28:10,531
Personally, I don't care.

332
00:28:10,633 --> 00:28:13,466
The fewer pinch-pricks
on the streets, the better.

333
00:28:13,569 --> 00:28:17,938
But the sooner you find
this butcher or tailor, lnspector...

334
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:21,635
the sooner we can all
celebrate your promotion.

335
00:28:22,745 --> 00:28:24,975
Keep me informed.

336
00:28:40,062 --> 00:28:42,963
He didn't know nothin'!

337
00:28:43,065 --> 00:28:45,966
Bloody Jew did it!
It's gotta be!

338
00:28:46,068 --> 00:28:49,970
Murdering kikes!

339
00:28:50,072 --> 00:28:52,973
Every cellar!
Every stable!

340
00:28:53,075 --> 00:28:54,975
We'll find him out!

341
00:28:55,077 --> 00:28:56,977
Some bleedin' Jew! Come on!

342
00:28:57,079 --> 00:28:59,912
That's enough!
Let's burn 'em out!

343
00:30:59,702 --> 00:31:01,829
l have wonderful news.

344
00:31:01,937 --> 00:31:03,837
Tell me.

345
00:31:03,939 --> 00:31:06,601
Surely you, of all people,
can guess.

346
00:31:06,709 --> 00:31:09,610
I don't want to guess with you.

347
00:31:11,113 --> 00:31:13,013
Dr. Marbury says...

348
00:31:15,751 --> 00:31:17,651
Dr. Marbury says?

349
00:31:19,288 --> 00:31:22,689
Dr. Marbury says
I'm going to have your child.

350
00:31:53,522 --> 00:31:56,582
Aye, to die...

351
00:31:56,692 --> 00:31:58,717
and go we know not where...

352
00:31:58,827 --> 00:32:01,728
but to lie in cold obstruction
and to rot.

353
00:32:04,466 --> 00:32:07,367
A simple " rest in peace"
would suffice, Godley.

354
00:32:07,469 --> 00:32:09,369
Yes, sir.

355
00:32:09,471 --> 00:32:12,372
In the midst of life
we are in death.

356
00:32:12,474 --> 00:32:16,001
Of whom may we seek for succor
but of thee, O Lord...

357
00:32:16,111 --> 00:32:19,103
who, for our sins,
are justly displeased?

358
00:32:19,214 --> 00:32:23,583
Yet, O Lord, Godmost holy,
O Lord most mighty--

359
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,264
Good afternoon, ladies.

360
00:32:40,369 --> 00:32:43,270
I'm lnspector Abberline.
This is Sergeant Godley.

361
00:32:43,372 --> 00:32:47,206
We're investigating the murders
of Polly Nichols and Martha Tabram.

362
00:32:47,309 --> 00:32:50,107
Yes, we understand that they
were both friends of you ladies.

363
00:32:50,212 --> 00:32:53,613
Close friends. We're rather hoping
you'dbe able to help us out.

364
00:32:53,716 --> 00:32:55,616
Don't know nothing.

365
00:32:55,718 --> 00:32:57,618
Me neither.

366
00:32:57,720 --> 00:33:00,917
Why you botherin' us?
You ought to be botherin'  McQueen.

367
00:33:01,023 --> 00:33:03,958
- Is he the boss on Nichol Street?
- He's the heart and soul of the gang.

368
00:33:04,059 --> 00:33:06,960
Isn't it your job
to be knowin' that small detail?

369
00:33:09,498 --> 00:33:12,399
And what makes you think McQueen
did this to your friends?

370
00:33:12,501 --> 00:33:14,492
Can't prove nothing by me.

371
00:33:16,605 --> 00:33:19,130
- You're Mary Kelly. Is that right?
- That's right.

372
00:33:19,241 --> 00:33:22,938
Well, Mary Kelly, unless one of you
is willing to testify against McQueen...

373
00:33:23,045 --> 00:33:25,741
I can't do nothing.

374
00:33:25,848 --> 00:33:27,748
Surely, lnspector...

375
00:33:27,850 --> 00:33:29,977
a strong, handsome man like you...

376
00:33:30,085 --> 00:33:32,986
you could do anything
you putyour brilliant mind to.

377
00:33:34,857 --> 00:33:38,918
I'm a coward and a weakling and I can't
help meself. What's your excuse?

378
00:33:39,028 --> 00:33:41,428
Why are you so bloody useless?

379
00:33:45,034 --> 00:33:47,969
Come on, Mary.
That won't help us.

380
00:34:11,293 --> 00:34:13,158
Is that you?

381
00:34:15,230 --> 00:34:18,529
Before my mother died,
back in lreland.

382
00:34:18,634 --> 00:34:20,898
- Is that when you came here?
- Yeah.

383
00:34:21,003 --> 00:34:23,369
When I was eight.

384
00:34:23,472 --> 00:34:25,372
When things was good.

385
00:34:25,474 --> 00:34:29,376
We were starvin',
but we were starvin' in fresh air.

386
00:34:31,647 --> 00:34:34,047
I was thinking...

387
00:34:34,149 --> 00:34:37,346
we ain't ever gonna earn enough
to satisfy the Nichols boys...

388
00:34:37,453 --> 00:34:39,216
and feed our own mouths.

389
00:34:41,323 --> 00:34:44,087
You said, right--
You said those men, yeah?

390
00:34:44,193 --> 00:34:47,594
The ones who took her rich artist man
and who took her as well.

391
00:34:47,696 --> 00:34:51,928
You said they was clean shaven
and their clothes was neat.

392
00:34:52,034 --> 00:34:55,094
- Yeah, right.
- Well, they weren't no criminals then.

393
00:34:55,204 --> 00:34:58,105
I mean, they weren't the likes
ofthe Nichols boys.

394
00:34:58,207 --> 00:35:00,038
They was unusual.

395
00:35:00,142 --> 00:35:02,076
Perhaps even official.

396
00:35:02,177 --> 00:35:03,906
What are you gettin' at, Annie?

397
00:35:05,881 --> 00:35:08,179
Maybe we could go with the papers.

398
00:35:08,283 --> 00:35:10,183
Get paid for the story, you know.

399
00:35:10,285 --> 00:35:12,651
"Where is Ann Crook?"
That sort of thing.

400
00:35:12,755 --> 00:35:15,315
The papers are always desperate
for things bad about the government.

401
00:35:15,424 --> 00:35:17,051
And it's a mystery to boot.

402
00:35:17,159 --> 00:35:19,457
It's not a bad plan.
What do you think, Mary?

403
00:35:19,561 --> 00:35:22,962
I'm thinkin' we should talk to that
inspector, the one at Polly's funeral.

404
00:35:23,065 --> 00:35:24,965
Oh, fuck me, no!

405
00:35:25,067 --> 00:35:28,969
If we go to the papers they might
hurt Ann or do something to her baby.

406
00:35:29,071 --> 00:35:32,734
What, worse than what'll happen to her
in Whitechapel when she sprouts teats?

407
00:35:32,841 --> 00:35:37,301
I don't know for sure, but l think we're
better off talkin' to that inspector.

408
00:35:37,412 --> 00:35:40,904
Lord, you are young after all.

409
00:35:43,418 --> 00:35:46,785
Four bitches.
That's what I thought.

410
00:35:46,889 --> 00:35:49,153
You only paid
for one bloody person.

411
00:35:49,258 --> 00:35:51,158
- They're my guests.
- Guests?

412
00:35:51,260 --> 00:35:53,820
Well, let me welcome your guests.

413
00:35:53,929 --> 00:35:56,727
- Go on, get out!

414
00:35:56,832 --> 00:35:58,732
Go on, get out!

415
00:35:58,867 --> 00:36:02,132
Get out ofhere, you bloody whores!
Go on!

416
00:36:02,237 --> 00:36:04,137
When you have four pence...

417
00:36:04,239 --> 00:36:08,539
you can come back with your
ladies-in-waitin', Your Grace.

418
00:36:08,644 --> 00:36:10,544
Oh, shut up!

419
00:36:10,646 --> 00:36:12,546
Ow!

420
00:36:12,648 --> 00:36:14,548
Back to work, then.

421
00:36:14,650 --> 00:36:17,551
- Well, let's try and stay together.
- You know we can't.

422
00:36:17,653 --> 00:36:20,554
Then stay good and clear
of Nichol Street.

423
00:36:20,656 --> 00:36:22,556
Come on!

424
00:36:23,759 --> 00:36:25,659
- All right, Annie?
- Ehh.

425
00:36:25,761 --> 00:36:27,661
Bloody bastard.

426
00:36:27,763 --> 00:36:29,663
- How's your head?
- Oh, very funny!

427
00:37:45,874 --> 00:37:47,774
Hyah!

428
00:38:29,151 --> 00:38:31,551
Boo!

429
00:38:34,089 --> 00:38:35,989
I didn't frighten you, did l?

430
00:38:37,726 --> 00:38:39,626
I been lookin' for ya.

431
00:38:39,728 --> 00:38:41,662
I been lookin' all over for ya.

432
00:38:41,763 --> 00:38:43,993
You been looking for me?

433
00:38:44,099 --> 00:38:47,000
Not for me.
On behalf of my gentleman.

434
00:38:47,102 --> 00:38:50,003
A very fine gentleman.
He sent me to find ya.

435
00:38:50,105 --> 00:38:52,903
Your gentleman sent you to find me?

436
00:38:53,008 --> 00:38:56,910
Oh, get off. I might be unfortunate,
but I'm not a blitherin' idiot.

437
00:38:57,012 --> 00:38:59,503
It's the truth.
It's the God's truth.

438
00:39:00,682 --> 00:39:02,650
He seen ya.
He likes ya.

439
00:39:02,751 --> 00:39:05,845
And he said tonight only you'll do.

440
00:39:07,289 --> 00:39:10,190
So he said to find ya,
take ya to Hanover Street...

441
00:39:10,292 --> 00:39:12,624
where he's waitin' for ya.

442
00:39:12,728 --> 00:39:15,526
- You're very pretty.

443
00:39:17,733 --> 00:39:20,497
Go on, then, get in.
I'll take you there.

444
00:39:20,602 --> 00:39:22,900
Oh, I almost forgot.

445
00:39:23,005 --> 00:39:26,702
My gentleman got you a present.
You like grapes?

446
00:39:26,808 --> 00:39:28,708
Yeah.

447
00:39:31,213 --> 00:39:34,114
Whoa!

448
00:39:34,216 --> 00:39:38,277
Your gentleman,
he must be very refined.

449
00:39:38,387 --> 00:39:40,651
- Very refined indeed.
- Get in.

450
00:39:40,756 --> 00:39:43,987
- I'll take you there.
- All right.

451
00:39:54,069 --> 00:39:55,969
Here we are.

452
00:40:04,446 --> 00:40:07,347
- I'm like a lady.
- You are a lady.

453
00:40:07,449 --> 00:40:10,543
Your gaffer,
does he want anything special?

454
00:40:10,652 --> 00:40:13,553
Just the usual, I expect.

455
00:40:13,655 --> 00:40:16,886
Now, this alley
takes you to a yard.

456
00:40:16,992 --> 00:40:18,892
My gentleman, he's quiet.

457
00:40:18,994 --> 00:40:20,894
He doesn't like disturbances.

458
00:40:21,997 --> 00:40:24,056
What I wanna know, right...

459
00:40:24,166 --> 00:40:27,727
is a toff like him,
how much is he offerin'?

460
00:40:29,404 --> 00:40:31,304
Here. Two florin.

461
00:40:31,406 --> 00:40:33,306
That'll do me.

462
00:40:33,408 --> 00:40:35,774
Let me see ya. Go on.

463
00:40:35,877 --> 00:40:37,777
- Down here?
- Yeah.

464
00:40:37,879 --> 00:40:41,212
Straight down.
Straight down to the door at the end.

465
00:40:41,316 --> 00:40:43,443
Shh.

466
00:40:43,552 --> 00:40:45,019
Shh.

467
00:40:45,120 --> 00:40:47,020
Straight down there, yeah?

468
00:40:49,124 --> 00:40:51,024
Oops.

469
00:40:53,628 --> 00:40:55,528
No!

470
00:41:15,984 --> 00:41:18,384
-Bugger off!.

471
00:41:18,487 --> 00:41:20,387
You watch your mouth!

472
00:41:21,857 --> 00:41:23,757
Anymore information?

473
00:41:23,859 --> 00:41:26,760
- My readers wanna know this stuff..
- Oh, do they?

474
00:41:26,862 --> 00:41:29,262
Found a piece of leather apron
in her mouth?

475
00:41:29,364 --> 00:41:31,594
No, Mr. Best,
but if it's your fancy...

476
00:41:31,700 --> 00:41:35,101
I'd be delighted to stuff your mouth
with a piece of leather.

477
00:41:35,203 --> 00:41:38,138
Come on, give us a tip.
Put your picture on the front page.

478
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:40,071
Cover-up!

479
00:41:40,175 --> 00:41:43,338
You're supposed to do something
about it! This is ridiculous!

480
00:41:43,445 --> 00:41:46,107
There'sableeding
murderer on the loose!

481
00:41:46,214 --> 00:41:48,114
What about my wife?

482
00:42:19,981 --> 00:42:22,279
This is Annie.

483
00:42:22,384 --> 00:42:25,319
Yes. Another of
the circle of friends.

484
00:42:25,420 --> 00:42:28,446
Annie Chapman.
DarkAnnie, they called her.

485
00:42:28,557 --> 00:42:32,220
You still say this
isn't the Nichols boys?

486
00:42:34,129 --> 00:42:37,121
Did the constable show you the leather
they found down by the water spout?

487
00:42:37,232 --> 00:42:40,133
Could be part of a butcher's apron.

488
00:42:40,235 --> 00:42:43,136
Leatherapron. Dear God.

489
00:42:43,238 --> 00:42:46,002
We could be looking
for a butcher after all.

490
00:42:46,107 --> 00:42:48,735
I saw her.

491
00:42:48,843 --> 00:42:50,834
- This one?
- Yeah. Last night.

492
00:42:52,681 --> 00:42:54,342
I saw her face.

493
00:42:59,054 --> 00:43:01,386
Don't trample over this area.

494
00:43:01,489 --> 00:43:04,049
Let us see the body!

495
00:43:04,159 --> 00:43:06,855
- Come on, let us see!
- Oh, God.

496
00:43:06,962 --> 00:43:08,361
There's your typical Londoner...

497
00:43:08,463 --> 00:43:11,398
imbued with the Christian spirit
of sym pathy for his fellow man.

498
00:43:11,499 --> 00:43:13,660
Or fellow whore, in this case.

499
00:43:13,768 --> 00:43:16,532
He's really out done himself
this time, hasn't he?

500
00:43:16,638 --> 00:43:18,538
He not only severed the intestines...

501
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:21,404
he carefully arranged them
around the neck and shoulders.

502
00:43:21,509 --> 00:43:24,706
I think he's taken
more organs this time.

503
00:43:30,852 --> 00:43:33,548
Grapes again. Why grapes?

504
00:43:34,756 --> 00:43:37,657
Only Polly and Dark Annie
were given grapes.

505
00:43:37,759 --> 00:43:41,251
Only they were disemboweled
in such a meticulous fashion.

506
00:43:41,363 --> 00:43:43,763
This ain't killing for profit.

507
00:43:45,367 --> 00:43:47,301
This is ritual.

508
00:43:47,402 --> 00:43:49,029
Yeah, but why grapes?

509
00:43:58,313 --> 00:44:00,144
So they'll trust whatever he offers.

510
00:44:11,693 --> 00:44:13,923
I've never fully understood
that tradition.

511
00:44:14,029 --> 00:44:15,462
They're for the ferryman...

512
00:44:15,563 --> 00:44:19,465
who takes the body across the river
into the land of the dead.

513
00:44:19,567 --> 00:44:22,968
If she don't have
the money to pay him...

514
00:44:23,071 --> 00:44:27,007
she'd have to wander forever,
lost between the two worlds.

515
00:44:34,349 --> 00:44:36,909
I need to consult a doctor.

516
00:44:37,018 --> 00:44:38,645
Are you ill, lnspector?

517
00:44:38,753 --> 00:44:40,983
A surgeon, to be specific.

518
00:44:41,089 --> 00:44:44,889
The killer removed the victim's uterus
and its attachments.

519
00:44:44,993 --> 00:44:47,791
My God.
He's out of his mind.

520
00:44:47,896 --> 00:44:50,421
That's very astute of you, sir.

521
00:44:50,565 --> 00:44:53,432
I don't appreciate sarcasm, lnspector.

522
00:44:53,535 --> 00:44:55,935
I'm sorry, sir.
I meant nothing by it.

523
00:44:56,037 --> 00:44:58,835
You already have a surgeon
at your disposal.

524
00:44:58,940 --> 00:45:02,398
I need a man with a strong stomach
and a sober mind.

525
00:45:02,510 --> 00:45:04,535
The police surgeon has neither.

526
00:45:04,646 --> 00:45:07,547
- No. Request denied.
- Why?

527
00:45:07,649 --> 00:45:09,549
Are you questioning my decision?

528
00:45:09,651 --> 00:45:11,812
No, sir.
I simply want to know why.

529
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:14,889
There's already too much nonsense
and gossip in the press.

530
00:45:14,989 --> 00:45:16,889
You start consulting doctors...

531
00:45:16,991 --> 00:45:19,653
and all sorts of wild notions
will be printed.

532
00:45:19,761 --> 00:45:22,855
No one else is to see the bodies.

533
00:45:23,965 --> 00:45:25,865
It is my honor...

534
00:45:25,967 --> 00:45:31,337
to present this...
unique medical phenomenon.

535
00:45:31,439 --> 00:45:34,465
Until last week, Mr.Joseph Merrick--

536
00:45:34,576 --> 00:45:36,476
John Merrick.

537
00:45:36,578 --> 00:45:38,478
I beg your pardon.

538
00:45:38,580 --> 00:45:40,480
Mr. John Merrick...

539
00:45:40,582 --> 00:45:43,176
was an attraction at a sideshow.

540
00:45:43,284 --> 00:45:45,514
Now he's being cared for...

541
00:45:45,620 --> 00:45:48,885
at England's leading hospital...

542
00:45:48,990 --> 00:45:50,890
and with your generosity...

543
00:45:50,992 --> 00:45:54,155
we will be able
to continue to do so.

544
00:45:55,296 --> 00:45:58,197
Ladies and gentlemen...

545
00:45:58,299 --> 00:46:00,699
Mr.John Merrick.

546
00:46:04,139 --> 00:46:06,039
Turn around.

547
00:46:13,114 --> 00:46:15,014
Oh, please.

548
00:46:15,116 --> 00:46:17,016
I can't stand it.

549
00:46:17,118 --> 00:46:20,178
Oh! He should have
been killed at birth!

550
00:46:27,462 --> 00:46:29,191
- Good health!

551
00:46:37,505 --> 00:46:40,406
That'll be the last one,
Your Royal Highness.

552
00:46:53,388 --> 00:46:57,256
These hands are a gift from God.

553
00:46:57,358 --> 00:46:59,986
- The psychotic patient is--
- Pardon, sir.

554
00:47:00,094 --> 00:47:02,562
- You Dr. Ferral?
- I am, yes.

555
00:47:02,664 --> 00:47:05,792
I'm lnspector Abberline,
assigned to Whitechapel.

556
00:47:05,900 --> 00:47:08,334
- My lord, you're the Ripper case.

557
00:47:08,436 --> 00:47:10,563
- Am I right?
- Yeah.

558
00:47:10,672 --> 00:47:13,573
Jolly good.
You've come to the perfect place.

559
00:47:13,675 --> 00:47:15,973
We've got butchers aplenty here.

560
00:47:16,077 --> 00:47:17,977
- I see.

561
00:47:18,079 --> 00:47:21,776
I could use the expertise of someone
like yourself to help solve this case.

562
00:47:21,883 --> 00:47:24,784
They tell me you're
the best young surgeon in London.

563
00:47:24,886 --> 00:47:26,911
Really?

564
00:47:27,021 --> 00:47:30,923
I don't see how a reputable surgeon
could know anything about it.

565
00:47:31,025 --> 00:47:33,516
This country's over run with foreigners.

566
00:47:33,628 --> 00:47:35,596
Orientals and...

567
00:47:35,697 --> 00:47:37,790
Jews.

568
00:47:37,899 --> 00:47:42,495
Socialists trying to stir things up
against our monarchy.

569
00:47:42,604 --> 00:47:44,663
That's who you should be pursuing.

570
00:47:44,772 --> 00:47:46,672
Don't you think?

571
00:47:46,774 --> 00:47:48,833
Excuse me.

572
00:47:48,943 --> 00:47:51,002
You don't belong here, do you?

573
00:47:53,948 --> 00:47:56,849
I'm afraid Dr. Ferral suffers
from the surgeon's malady.

574
00:47:57,952 --> 00:47:59,783
And what's that, sir?

575
00:47:59,888 --> 00:48:02,015
Want of feeling.

576
00:48:02,123 --> 00:48:04,455
He knows everything
about anatomy...

577
00:48:04,559 --> 00:48:06,322
and nothing about the soul.

578
00:48:07,428 --> 00:48:09,896
How may l assist you, lnspector?

579
00:48:09,998 --> 00:48:12,899
Well, forgive my ignorance,
sir, but, um...

580
00:48:13,001 --> 00:48:14,901
are you a surgeon?

581
00:48:15,003 --> 00:48:16,903
I was.

582
00:48:17,005 --> 00:48:19,803
Unfortunately, I suffered
a brain seizure six months ago.

583
00:48:19,908 --> 00:48:25,471
- Sorry to hear that, sir.
- These days I limit myself to teaching.

584
00:48:25,580 --> 00:48:28,674
So you see, I'm accustomed
to answering questions, lnspector.

585
00:48:31,185 --> 00:48:33,312
Well, sir...

586
00:48:33,421 --> 00:48:37,824
could you tell me what sort
of a knife, uh, would this be?

587
00:48:46,167 --> 00:48:49,068
I think you mean to
draw a Liston knife.

588
00:48:49,170 --> 00:48:52,071
It's named for Liston,
who was a surgeon in the Crimean War.

589
00:48:52,173 --> 00:48:54,573
Because there was no anesthetic
on the battlefield...

590
00:48:54,676 --> 00:48:57,110
he had to carry out these amputations
very quickly.

591
00:48:57,211 --> 00:48:59,111
Uh...

592
00:48:59,213 --> 00:49:02,671
do you, by any chance, have
the police surgeon's report available?

593
00:49:02,784 --> 00:49:04,684
Yes, I do, sir.

594
00:49:04,786 --> 00:49:06,686
May l?

595
00:49:06,788 --> 00:49:09,689
- We must keep this confidential.
- Of course.

596
00:49:11,893 --> 00:49:13,793
- There it is.
- Thank you.

597
00:49:19,067 --> 00:49:20,967
Hmm.

598
00:49:23,171 --> 00:49:25,071
Yes.

599
00:49:28,710 --> 00:49:30,610
Wouldn't someone
have heard their screams?

600
00:49:30,712 --> 00:49:33,146
Not if you cut their throats first.

601
00:49:34,248 --> 00:49:36,148
Yes.

602
00:49:36,250 --> 00:49:40,414
And how can you be sure they wouldn't
react to seeing the Liston knife?

603
00:49:40,521 --> 00:49:42,113
Grapes.

604
00:49:43,391 --> 00:49:45,222
He offers them grapes first.

605
00:49:45,326 --> 00:49:48,784
- Ah.
- Grapes are very tempting.

606
00:49:48,896 --> 00:49:51,456
Yes, of course.
They'd gobble them up, wouldn't they?

607
00:49:51,566 --> 00:49:54,467
And he might offer them
a drink to ease them down.

608
00:49:54,569 --> 00:49:56,298
A drink laced with laudanum.

609
00:49:57,772 --> 00:49:59,672
How do you know that?

610
00:49:59,774 --> 00:50:02,675
I found a sprig of grapes
on both victims' bodies...

611
00:50:02,777 --> 00:50:05,109
and I smelled the laudanum
on their lips.

612
00:50:05,213 --> 00:50:08,944
Laudanum is a derivative of opium.

613
00:50:09,050 --> 00:50:12,679
Apart from doctors and addicts,
not many would recognize it.

614
00:50:16,524 --> 00:50:19,618
How long have you
chased the dragon, lnspector?

615
00:50:23,331 --> 00:50:25,799
Well, these should help
with the headaches.

616
00:50:26,901 --> 00:50:28,630
And, um...

617
00:50:29,771 --> 00:50:32,672
opium leeches minerals
out of the body...

618
00:50:32,774 --> 00:50:34,833
so I've also given you a tonic...

619
00:50:34,942 --> 00:50:36,842
that will help to
restore your appetite.

620
00:50:36,944 --> 00:50:39,139
Thank you very much, sir.

621
00:50:42,450 --> 00:50:44,350
I'm a fool.

622
00:50:44,452 --> 00:50:47,979
I don't think you're a fool.
Far from it.

623
00:50:48,089 --> 00:50:51,684
I ought to have known, sir, that you're
Physician Ordinary to the Royal Family.

624
00:50:51,793 --> 00:50:53,693
Well, yes, it's certainly an honor...

625
00:50:53,795 --> 00:50:56,525
but it's an honor
best owed on many doctors.

626
00:50:56,631 --> 00:50:59,725
Now, about our friend here,
I can tell you this much:

627
00:50:59,834 --> 00:51:03,793
He cut their throats from left to right,
therefore he's right-handed.

628
00:51:03,905 --> 00:51:05,805
Excuse me.

629
00:51:05,907 --> 00:51:09,604
He had to slice through
four layers of tissue...

630
00:51:09,711 --> 00:51:12,111
and up to an inch
of subcutaneous fat.

631
00:51:12,213 --> 00:51:14,113
After that...

632
00:51:14,215 --> 00:51:16,115
he entered the abdominal cavity...

633
00:51:16,217 --> 00:51:19,516
so he would have had to use more
than just merely the Liston knife.

634
00:51:19,620 --> 00:51:23,681
Perhaps he was carrying a portable
amputation kit similar to this.

635
00:51:25,493 --> 00:51:27,017
What do you think?

636
00:51:34,869 --> 00:51:37,770
Is it possible, sir, that the killer
is an educated man...

637
00:51:37,872 --> 00:51:39,772
perhaps someone who studied medicine...

638
00:51:39,874 --> 00:51:42,843
but who is, in fact,
not a surgeon himself?

639
00:51:43,945 --> 00:51:45,845
The intestines are simple enough.

640
00:51:45,947 --> 00:51:48,177
But, uh, the uterus?

641
00:51:48,282 --> 00:51:51,683
The liver, especially. Hard to locate,
unless you know what you're doing.

642
00:51:51,786 --> 00:51:54,118
And he was working quickly, in the dark.

643
00:51:54,222 --> 00:51:56,713
I had held out hope that this...

644
00:51:56,824 --> 00:51:58,724
monster was a veterinarian...

645
00:51:58,826 --> 00:52:01,590
or a furrier or an...

646
00:52:01,696 --> 00:52:04,290
especially well-educated butcher.

647
00:52:04,398 --> 00:52:07,993
No, I must admit, if l were you...

648
00:52:08,102 --> 00:52:11,128
I'd look for someone with
a thorough knowledge of human anatomy.

649
00:52:13,307 --> 00:52:15,207
Damn him.

650
00:52:43,871 --> 00:52:46,271
Do you want me to suck it?

651
00:52:46,374 --> 00:52:48,774
I can suck the Thames dry.

652
00:52:48,876 --> 00:52:51,276
Don't be frightened, dearie.

653
00:53:07,595 --> 00:53:11,258
How far advanced
is our grandson's malady?

654
00:53:13,801 --> 00:53:17,259
Uh, no lesions have appeared, ma'am.

655
00:53:17,371 --> 00:53:21,034
There is some neural damage--
a slight trembling ofthe right hand.

656
00:53:21,142 --> 00:53:23,201
But I'm hopeful--
more than hopeful--

657
00:53:23,311 --> 00:53:25,211
that treatment will arrest the disease.

658
00:53:25,313 --> 00:53:30,216
He seems to us to be suffering
greatly in his mind.

659
00:53:30,318 --> 00:53:32,809
Is the disease affecting his emotions?

660
00:53:32,920 --> 00:53:35,912
Yes, well, of course
his mood is depressed...

661
00:53:36,023 --> 00:53:39,959
because ofthe news of the diagnosis.

662
00:53:40,061 --> 00:53:44,122
But that should improve
as he regains his strength.

663
00:53:44,232 --> 00:53:47,258
You are a true physician, Sir William.

664
00:53:47,368 --> 00:53:51,134
In all ways, you attend
to the health of our empire.

665
00:53:51,239 --> 00:53:53,264
We are grateful.

666
00:53:53,374 --> 00:53:55,342
Thank you, ma'am.

667
00:54:09,624 --> 00:54:12,149
If this is the beginning...

668
00:54:12,260 --> 00:54:14,922
of a five-pointed star--

669
00:54:15,029 --> 00:54:18,260
- A bloody Jewish star.
- Withers!

670
00:54:18,366 --> 00:54:21,733
Inspectoris talking,
which means you are what?

671
00:54:21,836 --> 00:54:23,770
- I'm listening, sir.
- Yes.

672
00:54:25,940 --> 00:54:28,966
This area would form a likely point.

673
00:54:29,076 --> 00:54:32,170
I want double shifts within
these streets until further notice.

674
00:54:32,280 --> 00:54:35,272
And don't only worry
about Jews and butchers.

675
00:54:35,383 --> 00:54:37,578
You stop anyone suspicious...

676
00:54:37,685 --> 00:54:39,949
including well-dressed gentlemen.

677
00:54:40,054 --> 00:54:41,954
And by the way, Withers...

678
00:54:42,056 --> 00:54:45,753
the Star of David has six points.

679
00:54:47,728 --> 00:54:50,526
Right. Once more into the breach,
dear friends.

680
00:54:52,800 --> 00:54:54,700
Dismissed!

681
00:55:03,277 --> 00:55:06,769
Why have you called me here?

682
00:55:08,416 --> 00:55:11,249
It's just--

683
00:55:11,352 --> 00:55:14,549
It's just you say three more
have to be killed.

684
00:55:16,057 --> 00:55:18,184
I can't take it, sir.

685
00:55:18,292 --> 00:55:21,887
It's everywhere.
It's in all the papers.

686
00:55:24,999 --> 00:55:27,194
I'm just a simple chap, sir.

687
00:55:27,301 --> 00:55:29,360
I'm not a great man like you.

688
00:55:31,005 --> 00:55:34,202
I just don't know
where I am at... anymore.

689
00:55:36,043 --> 00:55:39,103
There, there, Netley.

690
00:55:39,213 --> 00:55:41,807
I shall tell you where we are.

691
00:55:44,618 --> 00:55:48,213
We are in the most extreme
and utter region...

692
00:55:48,322 --> 00:55:50,290
of the human mind.

693
00:55:51,492 --> 00:55:53,551
A radiant abyss...

694
00:55:53,661 --> 00:55:57,654
where men meet themselves.

695
00:55:57,765 --> 00:56:00,325
I don't understand that.

696
00:56:00,434 --> 00:56:02,425
I don't understand, sir.

697
00:56:04,839 --> 00:56:07,307
Hell, Netley.

698
00:56:09,510 --> 00:56:11,808
We are in hell.

699
00:56:22,690 --> 00:56:26,023
- Let me go! Get your hands off me!
- Pull yourself together.

700
00:56:26,127 --> 00:56:28,561
Go on!

701
00:56:28,662 --> 00:56:30,527
- In with you!

702
00:56:30,631 --> 00:56:32,531
Sorry about that, lnspector.

703
00:56:32,633 --> 00:56:34,794
She's madly in love with me...

704
00:56:34,902 --> 00:56:37,234
although she hides it well.

705
00:56:38,506 --> 00:56:41,031
You said McQueen
killed your two friends.

706
00:56:41,142 --> 00:56:43,235
- So what are you doing here?
- Oh, I see.

707
00:56:43,344 --> 00:56:47,542
Women are butchered right and left,
and you can't do piss about it.

708
00:56:47,648 --> 00:56:50,242
- And I'm the fool.
- We're watching them.

709
00:56:50,351 --> 00:56:52,842
Can't arrest them without evidence,
so we watch them.

710
00:56:52,953 --> 00:56:55,751
- What else can we do?
- I'll testify.

711
00:56:55,856 --> 00:56:59,849
If you keep meself
and me friends alive, I'll testify.

712
00:56:59,960 --> 00:57:01,359
To what, precisely?

713
00:57:01,462 --> 00:57:04,488
That McQueen said he'd cut me
unless I pay him a pound a week.

714
00:57:04,598 --> 00:57:06,691
- No.
- What you mean, no?

715
00:57:06,801 --> 00:57:10,862
You asked me to testify.
Are you worried I'll let you down?

716
00:57:10,971 --> 00:57:13,667
I won't.
I promise I won't.

717
00:57:13,774 --> 00:57:16,902
You testify against McQueen,
maybe he goes in for a year or two.

718
00:57:17,011 --> 00:57:21,505
But his boys, they'll take
their revenge on you and your friends.

719
00:57:21,615 --> 00:57:24,448
I can't let you do it.

720
00:57:29,857 --> 00:57:32,451
It's your round this time.

721
00:57:35,229 --> 00:57:37,857
I confess, I have an appetite.

722
00:57:37,965 --> 00:57:41,298
One day, I'll be
a great big round woman...

723
00:57:41,402 --> 00:57:44,269
with a skinny little man
for a husband.

724
00:57:44,371 --> 00:57:46,464
And a dozen plump children, I imagine.

725
00:57:48,175 --> 00:57:52,111
You think that's funny-- an unfortunate
like me being a decent mother?

726
00:57:52,213 --> 00:57:54,238
No, no, I didn't mean that.
I didn't mean that at all.

727
00:57:54,348 --> 00:57:56,646
You'll be a wonderful mother
someday, Mary.

728
00:57:56,750 --> 00:57:58,809
Honest. I can see it.

729
00:57:58,919 --> 00:58:01,979
I see you in a little cottage
by the sea...

730
00:58:02,089 --> 00:58:03,989
surrounded by children.

731
00:58:04,091 --> 00:58:07,322
I can see it, Mary, clear as day.

732
00:58:10,131 --> 00:58:13,430
- I really do have visions, you know.
- Are you serious?

733
00:58:13,534 --> 00:58:16,594
Sergeant Godley calls 'em my intuitions.

734
00:58:18,539 --> 00:58:20,439
As a matter of fact...

735
00:58:20,541 --> 00:58:22,600
I had one about you in this case.

736
00:58:22,710 --> 00:58:25,008
You have visions about me?

737
00:58:25,112 --> 00:58:27,012
What might those be?

738
00:58:31,218 --> 00:58:33,209
I want you to think carefully.

739
00:58:33,320 --> 00:58:36,289
Besides McQueen,
besides these awful murders...

740
00:58:36,390 --> 00:58:38,858
has anything else happened to you
or perhaps to one of your friends...

741
00:58:38,959 --> 00:58:40,859
that's a bit out ofthe ordinary?

742
00:58:42,463 --> 00:58:46,331
Ben Kidney? That's Special Branch
she's describing, you know.

743
00:58:46,433 --> 00:58:49,425
What the hell would Ben Kidney and
Special Branch be doing in Whitechapel?

744
00:58:49,537 --> 00:58:51,437
Wait a minute.

745
00:58:51,539 --> 00:58:53,666
She's lrish-born, isn't she?
There's your answer.

746
00:58:53,774 --> 00:58:58,211
A secret lrish rebel. That's why
they wouldbe after her, right?

747
00:58:58,312 --> 00:59:00,678
They were after Ann Crook...

748
00:59:00,781 --> 00:59:02,681
who was having an affair
with a wealthy gentleman.

749
00:59:02,783 --> 00:59:05,115
A man she borea child.

750
00:59:05,219 --> 00:59:08,518
A child that's now missing,
along with its grandparents.

751
00:59:09,890 --> 00:59:12,825
- Right. Drive on, please, driver.

752
00:59:15,930 --> 00:59:18,524
You do not fuck with Special Branch.

753
00:59:18,632 --> 00:59:21,157
They fuck with you.

754
00:59:28,542 --> 00:59:31,204
I don't know what you're thinking,
and I don't care to know.

755
00:59:38,904 --> 00:59:41,338
Inspector Adderly.
Mr. Kidney wants to see me.

756
00:59:41,440 --> 00:59:42,839
Mr. Kidney's gone, sir.

757
00:59:42,941 --> 00:59:45,136
Didn't say where.
Could be for the night.

758
00:59:45,243 --> 00:59:47,837
No. He said he'd be back before 11:00,
and I should wait.

759
00:59:47,946 --> 00:59:51,177
Where are you going, sir?

760
00:59:51,283 --> 00:59:53,183
He said I should wait in his office.

761
00:59:54,553 --> 00:59:57,215
And what floor
is Mr. Kidney's office on?

762
00:59:58,824 --> 01:00:00,724
I don't know what floor,
you bloody idiot...

763
01:00:00,826 --> 01:00:03,090
because I haven't been to
his fucking office yet, have l?

764
01:00:03,195 --> 01:00:05,254
He told me to have
the desk man let me up.

765
01:00:05,363 --> 01:00:07,923
But I'm more than happy
to stand here like a knob...

766
01:00:08,033 --> 01:00:11,298
because you disobeyed
Ben Kidney's order.

767
01:00:11,403 --> 01:00:13,303
It's the second floor on the right.

768
01:00:13,405 --> 01:00:15,305
Thanks.

769
01:01:57,142 --> 01:02:01,169
Free lreland!

770
01:02:01,279 --> 01:02:03,509
Free lreland!

771
01:02:07,185 --> 01:02:08,846
Get inside, sir!

772
01:02:20,131 --> 01:02:22,156
Just some gunpowder, sir.
That's all.

773
01:02:22,267 --> 01:02:24,167
Little more than a firework.

774
01:02:25,470 --> 01:02:27,461
Anyone go in or out?

775
01:02:27,572 --> 01:02:30,666
Yes, sir. I'm sorry, sir.
Yes, uh--

776
01:02:30,775 --> 01:02:32,675
There's an lnspector Adderly
in your office.

777
01:02:43,588 --> 01:02:45,556
No, there's nothing missing here.

778
01:02:51,262 --> 01:02:54,891
The bastards have been in here, sir.
I can smell 'em.

779
01:03:15,754 --> 01:03:17,654
- No.
- Yes.

780
01:03:17,756 --> 01:03:20,657
No, not together.
Too suspicious.

781
01:03:20,759 --> 01:03:24,490
You wait for me, and if she's in there
you can go and visit her on your own.

782
01:03:24,596 --> 01:03:26,496
I'm going with you right now...

783
01:03:26,598 --> 01:03:28,498
or I'm going to the newspapers.

784
01:03:30,335 --> 01:03:32,235
I mean it.

785
01:03:39,611 --> 01:03:42,808
There's a number of mental disorders
for which it is necessary...

786
01:03:42,914 --> 01:03:46,611
to remove the front part of the brain.

787
01:03:46,718 --> 01:03:49,687
Her records indicate
that she was violent...

788
01:03:49,788 --> 01:03:53,224
threatening to do harm
to herself... and others.

789
01:03:53,324 --> 01:03:55,224
Does she have any relations?

790
01:03:55,326 --> 01:03:57,487
No, she's a ward of the state.

791
01:03:57,595 --> 01:04:00,393
- That's a lie.
- Listen to me.

792
01:04:00,498 --> 01:04:02,625
You're under arrest.
You're here to assist my investigation.

793
01:04:02,734 --> 01:04:06,295
- Keep your mouth shut. Is that clear?
- Sorry, sir.

794
01:04:06,404 --> 01:04:08,599
Good.

795
01:04:08,707 --> 01:04:10,607
What else do you know about her?

796
01:04:10,709 --> 01:04:13,337
All we know is that
she was an unfortunate...

797
01:04:13,445 --> 01:04:16,937
who lived in
the Whitechapel district.

798
01:04:17,048 --> 01:04:19,448
I'd like to ask her
a few questions.

799
01:04:21,152 --> 01:04:23,120
You won't get any sense out of her.

800
01:04:24,589 --> 01:04:26,489
I'm used to that.

801
01:04:39,237 --> 01:04:43,196
Hello, Ann.
I brought Mary Kelly.

802
01:04:43,308 --> 01:04:48,143
- Do you remember Mary Kelly?
- Ann, you know me.

803
01:04:48,246 --> 01:04:51,443
I'm your best friend
in all the world.

804
01:04:51,549 --> 01:04:55,178
Go away. Go away. Go away.

805
01:04:56,621 --> 01:04:59,715
Ann, I'm gonna find Baby Alice.

806
01:04:59,824 --> 01:05:02,224
I'm gonna take care ofher.

807
01:05:02,327 --> 01:05:06,161
Alice is laughing to me.
Laughing to me.

808
01:05:06,264 --> 01:05:09,392
Laughing to me all day long.

809
01:05:09,501 --> 01:05:12,197
It's all right.
It's all right, darling.

810
01:05:12,303 --> 01:05:14,203
What about her father?

811
01:05:15,373 --> 01:05:17,273
Have you seen
Alice's father, Ann?

812
01:05:20,411 --> 01:05:24,814
He's a prince. A prince.

813
01:05:24,916 --> 01:05:28,443
A prince! A prince!
And I'm a queen.

814
01:05:28,553 --> 01:05:31,078
I'm a queen! l'm a queen!

815
01:05:33,525 --> 01:05:36,551
How do you know he was a painter?

816
01:05:36,661 --> 01:05:38,595
He hired us to pose as artist models.

817
01:05:38,696 --> 01:05:43,099
And what exactly does that entail?
"Artist models."

818
01:05:43,201 --> 01:05:46,295
We stood very still
so he could paint us.

819
01:05:46,404 --> 01:05:49,237
What's the matter?
You think I was born a whore?

820
01:05:49,340 --> 01:05:51,604
Oh, I'm sorry.
I'm an unfortunate, not a whore.

821
01:05:51,709 --> 01:05:53,609
England doesn't have whores.

822
01:05:53,711 --> 01:05:57,306
Just a great mass
of very unlucky women.

823
01:05:57,415 --> 01:06:00,009
So, Ann Crook...

824
01:06:00,118 --> 01:06:02,416
and the painter became lovers--
is that it?

825
01:06:02,520 --> 01:06:07,048
He married her... in a lovely
Catholic church-- Saint Savior's.

826
01:06:07,158 --> 01:06:09,285
I was a witness,
as a matter off act.

827
01:06:09,394 --> 01:06:11,362
He married her in a Catholic church.

828
01:06:12,864 --> 01:06:14,923
What doyou think
they've done to Baby Alice?

829
01:06:19,037 --> 01:06:21,631
Special Branch
dumped her in Bishops gate?

830
01:06:21,739 --> 01:06:24,435
Yeah, as an unknown.

831
01:06:24,542 --> 01:06:28,410
- But why?
- When I find out, I'll tell you.

832
01:06:28,513 --> 01:06:32,244
- Take me to her. You have to.
- No, not yet.

833
01:06:32,350 --> 01:06:34,284
I need to know more first.

834
01:06:36,487 --> 01:06:39,945
Look here, I promise...

835
01:06:40,058 --> 01:06:42,526
that I'll help you
with Baby Alice, but not yet.

836
01:06:42,627 --> 01:06:45,755
You gotta trust me on that,
at least a little bit.

837
01:06:47,866 --> 01:06:50,801
I do. I do trust you.

838
01:06:50,902 --> 01:06:53,302
Good.

839
01:06:53,404 --> 01:06:56,498
Do you have little ones, lnspector?

840
01:06:56,608 --> 01:06:59,873
No. No.

841
01:07:01,646 --> 01:07:05,480
A year ago--
No, two years--

842
01:07:05,583 --> 01:07:08,279
I'm sorry, more than two years--

843
01:07:08,386 --> 01:07:12,220
my wife, um, passed away...

844
01:07:12,323 --> 01:07:15,121
giving birth to
what I'm told was a son.

845
01:07:15,226 --> 01:07:17,786
I'm sorry.

846
01:07:17,896 --> 01:07:19,955
Thanks.

847
01:07:24,769 --> 01:07:27,670
I wanna show you some paintings
on the way out, yeah?

848
01:07:27,772 --> 01:07:30,832
-Are you gonna take me into the gallery?
-Why not?

849
01:07:32,243 --> 01:07:34,143
Come on.

850
01:07:56,968 --> 01:08:00,369
- Did you see the look on her face?
- I think she stopped breathing.

851
01:08:05,109 --> 01:08:07,009
She's a fright.

852
01:08:07,111 --> 01:08:09,705
She has cold eyes.

853
01:08:09,814 --> 01:08:13,250
I feel like someone's
walking over my grave.

854
01:08:13,351 --> 01:08:16,252
There's one more painting
I want you to see.

855
01:08:34,372 --> 01:08:36,840
You know him, don't you?

856
01:08:36,941 --> 01:08:40,877
Those whom Godhas
joined together, let no man put a sunder.

857
01:08:40,979 --> 01:08:43,209
I pronounce...

858
01:08:43,314 --> 01:08:45,714
that theybe man and wife.

859
01:08:45,817 --> 01:08:49,981
In nomine Patris, et Filii,
et Spiritus Sancti. Amen.

860
01:09:00,665 --> 01:09:03,600
- Sir William Gull, please.
- Sir William isn't receiving visitors.

861
01:09:05,837 --> 01:09:07,395
Uh--

862
01:09:07,505 --> 01:09:10,133
Sir William?
It's lnspector Abberline.

863
01:09:10,241 --> 01:09:12,209
I need to speak with you, sir.

864
01:09:12,310 --> 01:09:14,972
Sir William is ill.
Can't receive any visitors.

865
01:09:17,749 --> 01:09:19,580
I said...

866
01:09:19,684 --> 01:09:22,312
you can't go in.

867
01:09:22,420 --> 01:09:25,651
lt's allright, Dr. Ferral.
I don't mind company.

868
01:09:25,757 --> 01:09:28,624
Have Anna bring us some tea,
would you, please?

869
01:09:33,931 --> 01:09:37,423
Ah, well, I wish
l could tell you, lnspector...

870
01:09:37,535 --> 01:09:39,469
that your story was fantastical.

871
01:09:41,706 --> 01:09:44,698
Unhappily, I cannot.

872
01:09:44,809 --> 01:09:50,270
I know for a fact that the prince
has a taste in unfortunate women.

873
01:09:50,381 --> 01:09:52,781
And I suppose it's
more than possible that...

874
01:09:52,917 --> 01:09:55,750
he concocted this elaborate deception...

875
01:09:55,853 --> 01:09:59,619
to have some privacy while
he indulgedin his secret life.

876
01:09:59,724 --> 01:10:03,125
But I know one reason
I have for stating...

877
01:10:03,227 --> 01:10:07,994
that Prince Edward being Jack the Ripper
is just incomprehensible.

878
01:10:08,099 --> 01:10:10,294
What's that, sir?

879
01:10:13,504 --> 01:10:17,338
If you repeat what I'm about to tell
you, both our lives are in jeopardy.

880
01:10:17,442 --> 01:10:20,104
Indeed, lhope for your sake
that what l'm about to say...

881
01:10:20,211 --> 01:10:23,078
will steer you clear of
the very real danger you're in.

882
01:10:23,181 --> 01:10:26,082
I think I'm well past the point
of safe return, sir.

883
01:10:28,419 --> 01:10:30,319
Prince Edward has syphilis.

884
01:10:32,957 --> 01:10:36,415
Not a pleasant state secret,
but a vital one.

885
01:10:36,527 --> 01:10:38,427
Well, then that proves it.

886
01:10:38,529 --> 01:10:42,795
I couldn't understand why the prince
was killing Ann Crook's friends...

887
01:10:42,900 --> 01:10:45,494
especially so savagely, but...

888
01:10:45,603 --> 01:10:47,571
he's not merely killing them.

889
01:10:48,806 --> 01:10:50,706
He's punishing them.

890
01:10:50,808 --> 01:10:53,140
He wants revenge.
Don't you see, sir?

891
01:10:53,244 --> 01:10:56,645
No, lnspector, I don't see.

892
01:10:56,747 --> 01:11:00,274
I'm afraid your wild speculations
about the prince's mental state...

893
01:11:00,384 --> 01:11:02,909
clever though they maybe...

894
01:11:03,020 --> 01:11:04,920
cannot overcome
the physical impossibility...

895
01:11:05,022 --> 01:11:06,956
of his committing these crimes.

896
01:11:07,058 --> 01:11:09,652
The disease is
far enough along that...

897
01:11:09,760 --> 01:11:12,558
the prince's hands
tremble uncontrollably.

898
01:11:12,663 --> 01:11:15,257
He's very weak,
and the killings of Jack the Ripper...

899
01:11:15,366 --> 01:11:18,961
require sure hands
and considerable vigor.

900
01:11:20,404 --> 01:11:22,929
And have you forgotten
the most telling fact?

901
01:11:24,275 --> 01:11:26,175
Whatever else the prince may be...

902
01:11:26,277 --> 01:11:29,041
he knows little or nothing
of human anatomy.

903
01:12:06,284 --> 01:12:10,744
Conduct the candidate to the center
ofthe lodge and cause him to kneel...

904
01:12:10,855 --> 01:12:12,823
for the benefit of prayer.

905
01:12:18,696 --> 01:12:22,154
Vouch safe thine aid,
Almighty Father of the universe...

906
01:12:22,266 --> 01:12:24,359
to this, our present convention.

907
01:12:26,137 --> 01:12:28,970
Who is this?

908
01:12:29,073 --> 01:12:31,633
A poor candidate
in a state of darkness...

909
01:12:31,742 --> 01:12:34,643
who comes of his own free will...

910
01:12:34,745 --> 01:12:37,839
perfectly prepared,
humbly soliciting...

911
01:12:37,949 --> 01:12:42,477
to be admitted into
the my steries and privileges.

912
01:12:42,587 --> 01:12:45,818
In all cases of danger and distress...

913
01:12:45,923 --> 01:12:48,289
in whom do you put your trust?

914
01:12:48,392 --> 01:12:50,121
In God.

915
01:12:50,228 --> 01:12:54,028
How did he find out about
the unfortunate and her child?

916
01:12:54,131 --> 01:12:56,497
Well, he has
that kind of cleverness...

917
01:12:56,601 --> 01:12:59,434
you'll sometimes find
in the middle classes.

918
01:12:59,537 --> 01:13:02,700
A cheap sort of intelligence,
but effective nevertheless.

919
01:13:04,208 --> 01:13:07,905
Hmm. Thank God that's not
something you're burdened by.

920
01:13:08,012 --> 01:13:09,912
Yes, thank God.

921
01:13:10,014 --> 01:13:12,710
Recite the solemn oath.

922
01:13:12,817 --> 01:13:14,876
Never to reveal our secrets...

923
01:13:14,986 --> 01:13:17,477
under no less a penalty than...

924
01:13:17,588 --> 01:13:20,148
my throat be cut across...

925
01:13:20,258 --> 01:13:23,091
my tongue be torn out by its root...

926
01:13:23,194 --> 01:13:26,186
and that I be buried in sand...

927
01:13:26,297 --> 01:13:28,197
a cable's length from shore.

928
01:13:30,034 --> 01:13:32,628
You don't think Gull
is confiding in him, do you?

929
01:13:32,737 --> 01:13:35,331
The old fellow isn't as far gone
as all that, is he?

930
01:13:36,440 --> 01:13:39,568
No. He's not that foolish.

931
01:13:44,048 --> 01:13:46,778
Let the brother receive the light.

932
01:14:02,300 --> 01:14:07,033
'Another beautiful
murder will be committed by me. "

933
01:14:07,138 --> 01:14:09,538
"Fear me.Jack the Ripper. "

934
01:14:09,640 --> 01:14:12,939
- They're rubbish, you know that.
- Yes, I agree. They're rubbish.

935
01:14:13,044 --> 01:14:16,980
Though why you persist in believing that
red-haired jezebel, I'll never know.

936
01:14:17,081 --> 01:14:20,312
Have you considered that she's the sort
of woman who likes to make up stories...

937
01:14:20,418 --> 01:14:22,318
particularly about men?

938
01:14:22,420 --> 01:14:24,411
She is, after all, a whore.
She's a woman who--

939
01:14:27,858 --> 01:14:31,658
"A rose by any other name."
Is that it?

940
01:14:33,664 --> 01:14:36,929
Frederick, my dear chum, no one
is more delighted than l am...

941
01:14:37,034 --> 01:14:40,003
that you've decided to resume
your interest in the fairer sex...

942
01:14:40,104 --> 01:14:42,072
but please remember...

943
01:14:42,173 --> 01:14:45,006
a woman like that can make a man feel
whatever she wants him to feel.

944
01:14:45,109 --> 01:14:47,304
- Sergeant Godley.
- Yes, sir.

945
01:14:47,411 --> 01:14:49,003
Arrest the Nichol Street gang.

946
01:14:49,113 --> 01:14:51,445
- Right away, lnspector.
- I tried to stop them, lnspector.

947
01:14:51,549 --> 01:14:53,983
This arrived with this afternoon's post.

948
01:14:54,085 --> 01:14:56,019
Open it up!

949
01:14:56,120 --> 01:14:59,817
"I send you half the kidney I took
from one woman, preserved for you.

950
01:14:59,924 --> 01:15:03,883
T'other piece I fried and ate.
It was very nice."

951
01:15:03,994 --> 01:15:06,929
We demand something be done,
and done tonight.

952
01:15:07,031 --> 01:15:09,864
" From Hell."

953
01:15:09,967 --> 01:15:12,697
Well, at least
they got the address right.

954
01:15:12,803 --> 01:15:15,966
It can't be.
Are you sure he was the same?

955
01:15:16,073 --> 01:15:18,906
I know him.
I posed for him twice meself.

956
01:15:19,009 --> 01:15:22,103
I stood there naked as a babe
watching him paint me for hours.

957
01:15:22,213 --> 01:15:24,477
And he was with Ann for what--
over a year?

958
01:15:24,582 --> 01:15:27,551
- Nearly two.

959
01:15:29,453 --> 01:15:32,183
Ah, here you are.
Hello, girls.

960
01:15:32,289 --> 01:15:34,689
Where have you been?
I told you to wait for me.

961
01:15:34,792 --> 01:15:37,989
I can't stay in a pub
and not have a drink.

962
01:15:38,095 --> 01:15:40,962
That's cruel.
But look who I bumped into.

963
01:15:41,065 --> 01:15:43,124
Remember Ada?

964
01:15:44,468 --> 01:15:47,130
- She's from France.
- Bruxelles.

965
01:15:49,173 --> 01:15:51,403
- Bruxelles.
- Yes.

966
01:15:51,509 --> 01:15:53,500
Oh, she is pretty, isn't she?

967
01:15:55,146 --> 01:15:58,741
Not in public, love.
Not in public.

968
01:15:58,849 --> 01:16:02,216
Would you give us a minute alone?
We need to speak with Liz.

969
01:16:02,319 --> 01:16:05,777
No, Ada, you stay where you are.

970
01:16:05,890 --> 01:16:07,858
Come, Mary.
Get a drinksy.

971
01:16:07,958 --> 01:16:11,189
- Mary.

972
01:16:19,303 --> 01:16:22,170
You don't have to worry
about Nichol Street for at least a week.

973
01:16:22,273 --> 01:16:25,140
- I can keep 'em that long.
- Well, that's something, anyway.

974
01:16:25,242 --> 01:16:27,710
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

975
01:16:27,812 --> 01:16:31,339
- Baby Alice, she's all right?
- Yeah, she's all right.

976
01:16:31,449 --> 01:16:33,349
We'll get her out after this is over.

977
01:16:33,451 --> 01:16:35,419
"We'll get her."

978
01:16:35,519 --> 01:16:37,419
Listen.

979
01:16:37,521 --> 01:16:40,354
I want you and your friends off the
streets until I can sort this thing out.

980
01:16:40,458 --> 01:16:43,188
- Off the streets? For how long?
- A few days, at least.

981
01:16:43,294 --> 01:16:45,194
Well, you better
throw us injail then...

982
01:16:45,296 --> 01:16:47,958
'cause we have no money for food
and no money for a doss.

983
01:16:48,065 --> 01:16:50,863
All right. You take this.

984
01:16:50,968 --> 01:16:53,698
Buy some food,
get a room and stay there.

985
01:16:53,804 --> 01:16:57,570
Don't tell anyone where you're going.
I don't want to know.

986
01:16:57,675 --> 01:17:00,906
In three days, come to the Ten Bells.

987
01:17:01,011 --> 01:17:03,275
I'll leave a message
with the barkeep.

988
01:17:06,517 --> 01:17:09,748
What? It's not enough?

989
01:17:09,854 --> 01:17:14,291
I wish I could show you
the little village where I was born.

990
01:17:14,391 --> 01:17:16,655
It's so lovely there.

991
01:17:16,760 --> 01:17:20,423
It's by the sea,
the way you said you saw me.

992
01:17:20,531 --> 01:17:23,694
I used to think it too small
to spend a life in...

993
01:17:23,801 --> 01:17:26,292
but now I'm not so sure.

994
01:17:32,076 --> 01:17:34,306
Don't. Don't.

995
01:17:34,411 --> 01:17:37,972
What? Do you think
I'm paying you back?

996
01:17:38,082 --> 01:17:40,573
I didn't mean it as business.

997
01:17:40,718 --> 01:17:43,243
I'm still a woman.
They haven't taken that away from me.

998
01:17:43,354 --> 01:17:45,254
Not yet, anyways.

999
01:17:57,935 --> 01:17:59,835
- Enough of that.

1000
01:18:01,305 --> 01:18:03,796
Now, lad, at least take--

1001
01:18:05,943 --> 01:18:07,843
Sorry, sir.

1002
01:18:26,997 --> 01:18:31,331
There, milady.
One more time.

1003
01:18:33,837 --> 01:18:35,737
And curtsy.

1004
01:18:37,608 --> 01:18:39,576
And we're done.

1005
01:18:49,153 --> 01:18:52,714
Oh, don't be modest, girl.
They don't care what we do.

1006
01:19:00,965 --> 01:19:03,559
I paid for your supper, remember.

1007
01:19:03,667 --> 01:19:06,363
Stop shaking your head at me,
you slag!

1008
01:19:06,470 --> 01:19:08,370
Leave her alone.

1009
01:19:08,472 --> 01:19:10,497
She is my business.
She's not yours.

1010
01:19:10,608 --> 01:19:12,508
Liz,just be quiet for one bloody night.

1011
01:19:12,610 --> 01:19:14,635
No, l fucking won't keep my voice down!

1012
01:19:14,745 --> 01:19:16,645
Calm down!
They'll call the land lord on us.

1013
01:19:16,747 --> 01:19:18,715
Don't go out.
It's not safe.

1014
01:19:18,816 --> 01:19:21,683
I need something to sustain myself.

1015
01:19:21,785 --> 01:19:24,015
- I will be right back.
- Liz, don't be so fucking stupid!

1016
01:19:24,121 --> 01:19:26,521
- Do without for a night.
- No.

1017
01:19:26,624 --> 01:19:29,058
- I want a fucking drink.
- Liz!

1018
01:19:32,296 --> 01:19:34,992
Here we are.
Service records.

1019
01:19:35,099 --> 01:19:38,694
Grenadier Guards.
Lieutenant Benjamin Kidney.

1020
01:19:40,437 --> 01:19:43,702
There, just as you suspected.

1021
01:19:45,175 --> 01:19:47,109
Before he joined Special Branch...

1022
01:19:47,211 --> 01:19:49,543
Ben Kidney served
in the Grenadier Guards.

1023
01:19:49,647 --> 01:19:53,344
Part of his duties included
assisting the field surgeon.

1024
01:19:53,450 --> 01:19:56,146
Let me tell you something, lnspector,
of which I'm absolutely certain.

1025
01:19:56,253 --> 01:20:00,314
Assisting an expert is different--
very, very different--

1026
01:20:00,424 --> 01:20:02,324
from doing it oneself.

1027
01:20:02,426 --> 01:20:05,156
Think about it. Someone's
gotta clean up after the prince.

1028
01:20:05,262 --> 01:20:08,425
And whose job is it
to take care of the widow's messes?

1029
01:20:08,532 --> 01:20:10,796
You've turned into Othello.
Do you know that?

1030
01:20:10,901 --> 01:20:12,960
Everything is a suspicion.

1031
01:20:13,070 --> 01:20:14,469
And like that tragic Moor...

1032
01:20:14,571 --> 01:20:16,869
all your suspicions
will end up in your own demise.

1033
01:20:16,974 --> 01:20:20,137
For heaven's sake, man,
these women aren't just being silenced.

1034
01:20:20,244 --> 01:20:23,907
They're being murdered most brutally.
Why would Ben Kidney do that?

1035
01:20:24,014 --> 01:20:27,142
To scare people.
To keep their mind off the real point.

1036
01:20:27,251 --> 01:20:28,445
Which is?

1037
01:20:28,552 --> 01:20:30,782
Think what's at stake
for Special Branch.

1038
01:20:30,888 --> 01:20:34,346
Prince Edward married Ann Crook,
a commoner and a Catholic.

1039
01:20:34,458 --> 01:20:37,120
Married her in a Catholic church.
They had a baby.

1040
01:20:37,227 --> 01:20:41,630
A legitimate baby, who is, in fact,
heir to the throne of England.

1041
01:20:41,732 --> 01:20:43,996
All these women were there.

1042
01:20:44,101 --> 01:20:48,265
All these women
were eyewitnesses to an event...

1043
01:20:48,372 --> 01:20:50,863
that could rip the empire to pieces.

1044
01:20:58,115 --> 01:21:01,516
When she starts drinking,
she'll go all night. You know that.

1045
01:21:01,618 --> 01:21:03,677
But she knows how dangerous it is.

1046
01:21:03,787 --> 01:21:05,914
She don't believe you
about the prince.

1047
01:21:06,023 --> 01:21:10,687
She thinks you're feeding that copper
candies to keep him interested.

1048
01:21:16,934 --> 01:21:19,095
Hello, sir.

1049
01:21:19,203 --> 01:21:21,933
Is anything wrong, my dear?

1050
01:21:22,039 --> 01:21:26,305
No, sir. For a moment,
I thought you were someone else.

1051
01:21:26,410 --> 01:21:29,072
Oh.

1052
01:21:29,179 --> 01:21:31,079
Thirsty?

1053
01:21:38,188 --> 01:21:41,351
Always parched, sir.

1054
01:21:41,458 --> 01:21:44,586
Perhaps there is somewhere nearby
that we might go...

1055
01:21:44,695 --> 01:21:48,324
while my coach man keeps watch.

1056
01:21:48,432 --> 01:21:51,230
Oh, yeah.

1057
01:21:51,335 --> 01:21:54,327
Yeah. This way.

1058
01:21:54,438 --> 01:21:56,338
Follow me.

1059
01:22:24,601 --> 01:22:28,264
Yeah, it's this way.
Follow me.

1060
01:22:31,508 --> 01:22:34,443
I dropped my grapes.

1061
01:22:34,545 --> 01:22:36,638
Oh!

1062
01:22:47,591 --> 01:22:49,821
No!

1063
01:22:54,865 --> 01:22:56,958
What the fuck
are you looking at, Lipski ?

1064
01:23:01,271 --> 01:23:03,933
Shut up! Shut up!

1065
01:23:27,331 --> 01:23:29,765
- I hear someone coming, sir.

1066
01:23:29,867 --> 01:23:31,767
- Sir!

1067
01:23:54,391 --> 01:23:56,291
All right, George, that's enough.

1068
01:23:57,427 --> 01:24:00,055
It's one of them, isn't it?

1069
01:24:00,163 --> 01:24:02,393
Throat's cut the same way.

1070
01:24:02,499 --> 01:24:04,729
Yeah.

1071
01:24:04,835 --> 01:24:07,235
He didn't finish.

1072
01:24:07,337 --> 01:24:09,737
Well, she's no less dead for that.

1073
01:24:11,308 --> 01:24:13,469
He won't be satisfied by this.

1074
01:24:17,848 --> 01:24:19,748
Wilkins?

1075
01:24:21,318 --> 01:24:24,810
Fetch the ambulance.
Go on, run along.

1076
01:25:08,065 --> 01:25:10,090
Excuse me, miss.

1077
01:25:51,241 --> 01:25:55,143
You could be dead... right now.

1078
01:25:55,245 --> 01:25:58,681
But then there wouldbe
too many bloody questions.

1079
01:26:01,651 --> 01:26:05,314
Ignore the old man's blathering.
Find a scape goat.

1080
01:26:05,422 --> 01:26:08,482
Or next time we won't care who asks...

1081
01:26:08,592 --> 01:26:11,527
"Whatever happened
to lnspector Abberline?"

1082
01:26:38,121 --> 01:26:40,749
We should hurry up, sir.
It's clearin' up.

1083
01:26:42,726 --> 01:26:46,059
Do you have a piece of chalk, Netley?

1084
01:26:46,163 --> 01:26:48,063
Chalk, sir?

1085
01:26:48,165 --> 01:26:51,157
-They found another one in Mitre Square!

1086
01:27:02,979 --> 01:27:05,641
Bastards! They did another one!

1087
01:27:12,489 --> 01:27:14,389
l heard he cut off her nose this time.

1088
01:27:16,493 --> 01:27:19,985
Nice work, lnspector. You've
encouraged him to do two a night now.

1089
01:27:20,097 --> 01:27:22,031
Out ofthe fucking way, cunt.

1090
01:27:30,674 --> 01:27:33,336
Katherine Eddowes.

1091
01:27:33,443 --> 01:27:35,843
There's some writing on a wall
just down the road there.

1092
01:27:35,946 --> 01:27:37,846
You should have a look at it.

1093
01:27:39,516 --> 01:27:43,816
"The 'Juwes'are the men
that will not be blamed for nothing. "

1094
01:27:43,920 --> 01:27:46,184
It's hardly Shakespeare, but it'll do.

1095
01:27:49,359 --> 01:27:51,259
I was busy with the children--

1096
01:27:51,361 --> 01:27:54,194
Madame, slow down. Slow down.

1097
01:27:54,297 --> 01:27:57,198
Make sure you get
the apron as well, yeah?

1098
01:28:07,511 --> 01:28:09,877
It was written by the killer, sir.

1099
01:28:09,980 --> 01:28:12,278
And how do you know that?

1100
01:28:12,382 --> 01:28:14,816
I was here three-quarters
of an hour ago.

1101
01:28:16,553 --> 01:28:19,044
This building-- mostly Jews
live here, is that right?

1102
01:28:19,156 --> 01:28:21,920
- Yeah, that's right.
- Ready now, sir.

1103
01:28:22,025 --> 01:28:24,118
Put that away and get out of here
immediately.

1104
01:28:26,730 --> 01:28:28,630
- Abberline.
- Yeah?

1105
01:28:28,732 --> 01:28:30,097
Wash that off.

1106
01:28:30,200 --> 01:28:31,929
- What?
- You heard me.

1107
01:28:32,035 --> 01:28:34,731
- It's evidence, sir.
- Listen to me.

1108
01:28:34,838 --> 01:28:39,241
In another hour, there will be
a thousand people poking about in here.

1109
01:28:39,342 --> 01:28:42,937
If those words are seen,
not a Jew in London will be safe.

1110
01:28:43,046 --> 01:28:46,482
We'll have may hem on the streets.
So wash it off!.

1111
01:28:46,583 --> 01:28:51,145
That's an educated hand, sir.
An educated man wrote that.

1112
01:28:51,254 --> 01:28:53,688
- Look for yourself.
- I don't have to look. I've seen it.

1113
01:28:54,891 --> 01:28:58,486
An educated man
knows how to spell "Jews."

1114
01:28:58,595 --> 01:29:00,893
I don't know what this refers to,
but I'm sure it's got nothing to do...

1115
01:29:00,997 --> 01:29:02,897
with the people who live around here.

1116
01:29:06,703 --> 01:29:11,003
Sergeant, I want two constables
to wash that off.

1117
01:29:11,107 --> 01:29:15,771
What are you looking to him for?
Wash it off!.

1118
01:29:15,879 --> 01:29:17,642
Yes, sir.

1119
01:29:19,549 --> 01:29:22,313
Halfa dozen men have seen it already.
The sergeant has copied it down.

1120
01:29:22,419 --> 01:29:25,411
I'll remember these words
for as long as I live.

1121
01:29:25,522 --> 01:29:29,151
So all you're doing
is destroying its value as evidence.

1122
01:29:29,259 --> 01:29:32,057
No, all I'm doing is taking
charge of an investigation...

1123
01:29:32,162 --> 01:29:35,461
that you have bungled
to the point of gross inefficiency...

1124
01:29:35,565 --> 01:29:37,692
and I've had enough.

1125
01:29:37,801 --> 01:29:40,429
You are suspended from duty, Abberline.

1126
01:29:41,738 --> 01:29:44,605
Inspector Abberline is suspended.

1127
01:29:45,909 --> 01:29:49,401
- All his privileges are cancelled.
- Yes, sir.

1128
01:30:04,728 --> 01:30:07,595
You've not seen her, then?

1129
01:30:07,697 --> 01:30:10,291
Well, if she comes around,
give her this.

1130
01:30:12,669 --> 01:30:14,637
Long letter, eh?

1131
01:30:16,239 --> 01:30:18,139
This is for your trouble.

1132
01:30:19,342 --> 01:30:21,902
The letter's private.
You understand?

1133
01:30:22,012 --> 01:30:24,913
- I understand.
- Right.

1134
01:31:14,597 --> 01:31:17,498
Where's this?

1135
01:31:21,237 --> 01:31:23,467
Recite the solemn oath.

1136
01:31:23,573 --> 01:31:27,270
Never to reveal our secrets--

1137
01:31:45,495 --> 01:31:47,395
Grapes again.

1138
01:31:48,865 --> 01:31:50,924
Why grapes?

1139
01:31:51,034 --> 01:31:52,934
This ain't killing for profit.

1140
01:31:53,036 --> 01:31:55,197
-He's not that foolish.
-You oughta be botherin' McQueen.

1141
01:31:55,305 --> 01:31:57,933
-Are you questioning my decision?
-Find a scape goat.

1142
01:32:01,311 --> 01:32:03,404
This is ritual.

1143
01:33:12,248 --> 01:33:16,514
"Jubela,Jubelo,Jubelum."

1144
01:33:18,455 --> 01:33:20,355
"Juwes."

1145
01:33:50,854 --> 01:33:53,584
- It's me, Ada. Me. Only me.

1146
01:33:54,691 --> 01:33:57,091
I bring everything for supper.

1147
01:33:59,829 --> 01:34:02,730
You little thief.
I need this money.

1148
01:34:02,832 --> 01:34:05,892
I just take some money
and buy food for me and for you.

1149
01:34:06,002 --> 01:34:08,903
Is that bad, Marie?

1150
01:34:09,005 --> 01:34:11,997
It's fine, dear.
You're a good person, but listen.

1151
01:34:12,108 --> 01:34:15,976
Until I go away from London,
it's not safe for you to go out.

1152
01:34:16,079 --> 01:34:18,877
Understand?

1153
01:34:18,982 --> 01:34:22,679
I stay with Marie.
Beautiful Marie.

1154
01:34:22,785 --> 01:34:26,312
It's all right, darling.
You don't have to pay for your food.

1155
01:34:26,422 --> 01:34:28,322
Pardon?

1156
01:34:31,327 --> 01:34:33,295
Here's to our feast.

1157
01:35:07,997 --> 01:35:11,956
I'm so sorry to greet you
like this, lnspector, but--

1158
01:35:12,068 --> 01:35:13,968
but l'm rather late
for an appointment.

1159
01:35:14,070 --> 01:35:16,163
Will you excuse me
if l finish dressing while we talk?

1160
01:35:16,272 --> 01:35:18,172
No, no. Please, go on.

1161
01:35:18,274 --> 01:35:19,866
Thank you.

1162
01:35:21,578 --> 01:35:25,344
I'd like to speak to you about
the Freemasons if l might, sir.

1163
01:35:27,116 --> 01:35:31,780
The arrangement of the coins
at Dark Annie's feet...

1164
01:35:31,888 --> 01:35:35,483
and also the locations of the bodies...

1165
01:35:36,659 --> 01:35:38,559
form apentacle star.

1166
01:35:38,661 --> 01:35:41,755
A pentacle star is a symbol
of the Freemasons, is it not, sir?

1167
01:35:41,864 --> 01:35:43,764
Yes.

1168
01:35:45,735 --> 01:35:50,172
And the way that all these women were
killed-- throats cut left to right...

1169
01:35:51,641 --> 01:35:53,541
organs removed.

1170
01:35:55,511 --> 01:35:57,411
They're reenactments,
aren't they, sir?

1171
01:36:00,683 --> 01:36:02,583
Reenactments of what?

1172
01:36:02,685 --> 01:36:05,916
The Juwes.

1173
01:36:06,022 --> 01:36:08,547
The traitors who killed Hiram Abiff,
founder of the Masons--

1174
01:36:08,658 --> 01:36:11,320
that's how they were executed.

1175
01:36:11,427 --> 01:36:15,420
Ah, yes.
So the great book tells us.

1176
01:36:15,531 --> 01:36:19,797
So Jack the Ripper
isn't just merely killing whores.

1177
01:36:21,137 --> 01:36:23,037
He's executing traitors.

1178
01:36:23,139 --> 01:36:26,302
He's a Mason fulfilling a duty.

1179
01:36:26,409 --> 01:36:28,900
Yes, I'm afraid, lnspector...

1180
01:36:29,012 --> 01:36:31,037
that you won't be permitted
to arrest him.

1181
01:36:31,147 --> 01:36:33,911
I don't want to arrest him.

1182
01:36:36,953 --> 01:36:39,751
The Ripper has
one more traitor yet to kill...

1183
01:36:39,856 --> 01:36:42,654
and I will stop him.

1184
01:36:47,530 --> 01:36:49,998
Did they come to you, sir...

1185
01:36:50,099 --> 01:36:52,158
as a loyal Mason?

1186
01:36:53,936 --> 01:36:57,303
Did they ask you to help them cover up
the prince's secret marriage?

1187
01:37:01,144 --> 01:37:03,339
That's how it started, yes.

1188
01:37:03,446 --> 01:37:07,109
And then you discovered
the prince had syphilis.

1189
01:37:08,317 --> 01:37:10,615
He's going to die of it, lnspector.

1190
01:37:12,722 --> 01:37:15,520
Would you like a tour
of the syphilis wards?

1191
01:37:18,728 --> 01:37:21,720
You're a physician ordinary
to the queen...

1192
01:37:23,700 --> 01:37:27,466
entrusted with the well-being
of the heir to the throne.

1193
01:37:27,570 --> 01:37:30,232
Only you...

1194
01:37:30,339 --> 01:37:33,740
had reason to believe
that these unfortunates...

1195
01:37:33,843 --> 01:37:36,073
these whores...

1196
01:37:36,179 --> 01:37:38,647
these... traitors...

1197
01:37:40,283 --> 01:37:42,251
destroyed your life's work.

1198
01:37:51,227 --> 01:37:54,685
Below the skin of history...

1199
01:37:54,797 --> 01:37:56,731
are London's veins.

1200
01:37:56,833 --> 01:38:02,362
These symbols--
the mitre, the pentacle star--

1201
01:38:02,472 --> 01:38:04,963
even someone as ignorant...

1202
01:38:05,074 --> 01:38:08,669
and degenerate as you...

1203
01:38:08,778 --> 01:38:13,044
can sense that they course
with energy and meaning.

1204
01:38:16,719 --> 01:38:19,984
I am that meaning.

1205
01:38:20,089 --> 01:38:23,058
I am that energy.

1206
01:38:31,200 --> 01:38:33,691
One day, men will look back...

1207
01:38:35,705 --> 01:38:38,902
and say I gave birth
to the 20th century.

1208
01:38:45,982 --> 01:38:48,450
You're not going to see
the 20th century.

1209
01:39:29,759 --> 01:39:32,728
Roll up his sleeve.

1210
01:39:35,531 --> 01:39:38,329
- Don't struggle.

1211
01:39:40,102 --> 01:39:42,002
You'll only make this more painful.

1212
01:41:05,021 --> 01:41:07,546
You all right, mate?

1213
01:43:09,845 --> 01:43:12,678
-Dr. Gull.
-Yes!

1214
01:43:12,782 --> 01:43:15,216
You were describing
the human heart.

1215
01:43:16,952 --> 01:43:18,852
Yes.

1216
01:43:20,322 --> 01:43:23,052
Yes.

1217
01:43:23,159 --> 01:43:25,719
The human heart...

1218
01:43:25,828 --> 01:43:28,456
is a dense and powerful muscle...

1219
01:43:29,999 --> 01:43:33,127
much like the organic
equivalent of mahogany.

1220
01:43:34,236 --> 01:43:37,728
And notoriously difficult...

1221
01:43:37,840 --> 01:43:39,740
to burn.

1222
01:43:42,945 --> 01:43:44,845
About the size of a fist...

1223
01:43:46,515 --> 01:43:49,075
it provides the motor power
for the circulatory system.

1224
01:43:51,620 --> 01:43:55,420
The heart contains two atria,
two ventricles...

1225
01:43:55,524 --> 01:43:57,424
and fourvalves.

1226
01:43:58,627 --> 01:44:02,563
It is, in eff.ect, asingle pump...

1227
01:44:02,665 --> 01:44:04,860
powering a double circuit.

1228
01:44:07,470 --> 01:44:11,907
In the adult the heart rate
averages 70 to 80 beats a minute.

1229
01:44:15,077 --> 01:44:18,672
Such is the force
of the heartbeat...

1230
01:44:18,781 --> 01:44:23,377
that if the body's largest artery,
the aorta, is severed...

1231
01:44:25,454 --> 01:44:29,857
-a six-footjet of blood...

1232
01:44:29,959 --> 01:44:32,291
is released.

1233
01:45:06,195 --> 01:45:09,221
Let the brother receive the light.

1234
01:45:12,768 --> 01:45:17,671
For you fear no God, arise.

1235
01:45:18,874 --> 01:45:21,001
Your faith is well founded.

1236
01:46:00,983 --> 01:46:03,645
Don't. Don't go in there.
There's no need.

1237
01:46:03,752 --> 01:46:06,585
How bad is it?

1238
01:46:06,689 --> 01:46:09,749
She's-She's in pieces, sir.

1239
01:46:09,858 --> 01:46:11,758
Sergeant, he can go in.

1240
01:46:24,607 --> 01:46:27,542
- Give him to me!
- He'll be taken care of, I swear to it.

1241
01:46:27,643 --> 01:46:31,010
- I want him.
- He's done. I give you my word.

1242
01:46:31,113 --> 01:46:35,345
Fuck your word! I'll bring every
last one of you fucking cunts down.

1243
01:46:35,451 --> 01:46:37,351
You and your fucking brothers!

1244
01:46:37,453 --> 01:46:39,250
Now, listen to me, Abberline.

1245
01:46:39,355 --> 01:46:41,721
Your situation--
your difficult situation--

1246
01:46:41,824 --> 01:46:43,724
has been thoroughly discussed.

1247
01:46:43,826 --> 01:46:47,887
You are reinstated.
Indeed, you are promoted.

1248
01:46:49,832 --> 01:46:51,857
- No! No.

1249
01:46:51,967 --> 01:46:54,834
Come on. This is not helping anything.
Come on! Come on.

1250
01:46:54,937 --> 01:46:58,429
Don't be a fool, lnspector.

1251
01:46:58,540 --> 01:47:02,476
You will be very closely watched.

1252
01:47:02,578 --> 01:47:04,478
Yeah, you're all there now, ain'tya?

1253
01:47:04,580 --> 01:47:06,514
Where were you
when this was happening?

1254
01:47:06,615 --> 01:47:09,709
It's all right for you, standing
around there chatting. What about us?

1255
01:47:09,818 --> 01:47:12,946
Inspector Abberline is in charge.

1256
01:47:13,055 --> 01:47:16,115
Give him all the assistance
he requires.

1257
01:47:22,564 --> 01:47:24,464
No!

1258
01:47:24,566 --> 01:47:27,364
Remember, you're being watched.

1259
01:47:27,469 --> 01:47:30,097
All right, come on, you men.
Clear this passage.

1260
01:47:30,205 --> 01:47:33,072
- Come on. Move 'em away.
- Move back! Back!

1261
01:47:40,849 --> 01:47:42,783
Shall we proceed, lnspector?

1262
01:48:02,671 --> 01:48:05,401
Body lies in middle of bed.

1263
01:48:05,507 --> 01:48:10,638
Shoulders flat,
but axis of body inclined toward right.

1264
01:48:10,746 --> 01:48:12,805
The left arm is close to the body...

1265
01:48:12,915 --> 01:48:14,815
the forearm flexed at a right angle...

1266
01:48:14,917 --> 01:48:17,613
resting across the abdomen.

1267
01:48:17,720 --> 01:48:22,419
The right arm
is slightly abducted from the body.

1268
01:48:22,524 --> 01:48:25,152
It rests on the mattress
with the elbow bent...

1269
01:48:25,260 --> 01:48:27,160
and the forearm supine.

1270
01:48:29,264 --> 01:48:33,701
The fingers are clenched,
indicating as truggle as she died.

1271
01:48:33,802 --> 01:48:36,100
Notice something, lnspector?

1272
01:48:37,339 --> 01:48:40,069
No.

1273
01:48:40,175 --> 01:48:43,042
No, go on.

1274
01:48:47,116 --> 01:48:49,016
Came in not long before dawn.

1275
01:48:49,118 --> 01:48:51,678
A bit of a rush.
Left this for ya.

1276
01:48:59,828 --> 01:49:01,921
l know you asked me to wait.

1277
01:49:02,030 --> 01:49:06,865
If l'm to be murdered,
I'd like at least to die in my village.

1278
01:49:06,969 --> 01:49:09,836
I'm going to the orphanage
to collect Baby Alice.

1279
01:49:09,938 --> 01:49:12,532
Here's an address where you can find us.

1280
01:49:12,641 --> 01:49:14,541
We'll wait for you eagerly.

1281
01:49:14,643 --> 01:49:17,077
I know-- I knowi n my heart...

1282
01:49:17,179 --> 01:49:19,647
we can be happy living by the sea...

1283
01:49:19,748 --> 01:49:22,342
just as you saw.

1284
01:49:22,451 --> 01:49:25,147
I hope to be with you soon, dearest.

1285
01:49:25,254 --> 01:49:27,449
All my love, Mary.

1286
01:49:39,668 --> 01:49:39,802
We are deeply distressed, Lord Hallsham.

1287
01:49:39,802 --> 01:49:42,896
We are deeply distressed, LordHallsham.

1288
01:49:43,005 --> 01:49:48,102
We asked Sir William to remove a threat
to our family and to our throne...

1289
01:49:48,210 --> 01:49:51,702
not to engage
in these ghastly rituals.

1290
01:49:51,814 --> 01:49:56,080
Oh, no, of course not, Your Majesty.
That was unexpected.

1291
01:49:56,185 --> 01:49:59,052
On the other hand,
he has fulfilled his duties.

1292
01:49:59,154 --> 01:50:01,622
The threat is passed, Your Majesty.

1293
01:50:01,723 --> 01:50:05,591
In his way Sir William has been loyal...

1294
01:50:05,694 --> 01:50:08,254
and we are grateful for that.

1295
01:50:08,363 --> 01:50:10,957
The rest is in your hands,
Lord Hallsham.

1296
01:50:11,066 --> 01:50:14,627
We wish to hear nothing further of this.

1297
01:50:15,737 --> 01:50:18,035
Knight of the East...

1298
01:50:18,140 --> 01:50:20,574
we are gathered here
beneath the God of love...

1299
01:50:20,676 --> 01:50:24,703
and before the sight of
the Great Architect to judge this case.

1300
01:50:24,813 --> 01:50:29,876
You standa ccused of mayhems that have
placed our brotherhood in jeopardy.

1301
01:50:29,985 --> 01:50:33,648
You stand before your peers--
Masons and doctors both.

1302
01:50:33,755 --> 01:50:38,124
- I have no peers present here.
- What?

1303
01:50:38,227 --> 01:50:41,822
No man amongst you
is fit to judge...

1304
01:50:41,930 --> 01:50:44,956
the mighty art that I have wrought.

1305
01:50:45,067 --> 01:50:48,798
Your rituals are empty oaths
you neither understand...

1306
01:50:48,904 --> 01:50:50,804
nor live by.

1307
01:50:54,076 --> 01:50:57,239
The Great Architect speaks to me.

1308
01:50:57,346 --> 01:51:00,509
He is the balance where my deeds
are weighed and judged...

1309
01:51:03,018 --> 01:51:04,918
not you.

1310
01:51:05,020 --> 01:51:07,147
Knight of the East...

1311
01:51:07,256 --> 01:51:09,156
hear our judgement.

1312
01:52:00,242 --> 01:52:02,142
Well, they're not watching you anymore.

1313
01:52:07,349 --> 01:52:09,544
I'm telling you, it's safe to go to her.

1314
01:52:10,786 --> 01:52:12,686
They think she's dead.

1315
01:52:12,788 --> 01:52:15,985
If l disappear or
change my routine suddenly...

1316
01:52:16,091 --> 01:52:18,889
they might wonder why.

1317
01:52:18,994 --> 01:52:20,894
You know who you're gonna
turn into, don't you?

1318
01:52:20,996 --> 01:52:24,397
That boring old bugger in the pub
that nobody wants to sit beside.

1319
01:52:24,499 --> 01:52:26,524
'Cause as soon as he's had
a few drinks, he goes on and on...

1320
01:52:26,635 --> 01:52:28,728
about the girl that got away.

1321
01:52:28,837 --> 01:52:32,933
Do you want to live
the rest of your life like a ghost?

1322
01:52:34,042 --> 01:52:35,942
No.

1323
01:52:37,546 --> 01:52:40,947
What I want is to go to her.

1324
01:52:41,049 --> 01:52:44,109
But at the slightest hint that she's
a live, they will spare no expense--

1325
01:52:44,219 --> 01:52:47,211
no expense and no trouble.

1326
01:52:47,322 --> 01:52:51,281
So I stay... and watch them.

1327
01:53:28,363 --> 01:53:31,696
Alice! Alice!

1328
01:53:31,800 --> 01:53:33,791
Come in, darling.

1329
01:53:38,573 --> 01:53:40,632
Coming, Mother.

1330
01:54:24,286 --> 01:54:27,221
Get up.

1331
01:54:27,322 --> 01:54:29,688
Get up! Come on.

1332
01:55:19,441 --> 01:55:21,705
Good night, sweet prince.
