to the tolerance of anxiety.

is that a fugue state

00:12:31,663 --> 00:12:33,491
Well, that's Jane.

178
00:12:33,535 --> 00:12:35,755
That's my wife.

179
00:12:39,062 --> 00:12:41,325
Jane: 
When did you say 
we got married?

180
00:12:41,369 --> 00:12:43,719
Man: 
August 18th, 1982.

181
00:12:43,763 --> 00:12:46,330
 It's right there 
in the marriage 
certificate.

182
00:12:46,374 --> 00:12:48,506
Where is this?

183
00:12:48,550 --> 00:12:50,770
That's St. Thomas,
Christmas.

184
00:12:50,813 --> 00:12:52,510
Our first vacation.

185
00:12:52,554 --> 00:12:55,296
I had just finished
my surgical residency.

186
00:12:55,339 --> 00:12:57,864
Are you
at City General, too?

187
00:12:57,907 --> 00:12:59,779
No. I have
privileges there,

188
00:12:59,822 --> 00:13:02,433
but I'm Chief
of Pediatric Surgery

189
00:13:02,477 --> 00:13:04,218
at Jefferson Memorial.

190
00:13:07,743 --> 00:13:10,180
Where's
my wedding band?

191
00:13:12,879 --> 00:13:14,663
Your wedding band.

192
00:13:14,706 --> 00:13:17,405
You went into
a ladies' room
of a restaurant

193
00:13:17,448 --> 00:13:19,233
and went to put cream
in your hands or something.

194
00:13:19,276 --> 00:13:21,061
It slipped
down the drain.

195
00:13:21,104 --> 00:13:23,846
[ chuckles ]
You drove the manager crazy

196
00:13:23,890 --> 00:13:25,108
having him tear
all the plumbing apart.

197
00:13:25,152 --> 00:13:27,067
We never found it.

198
00:13:27,110 --> 00:13:31,114
I promised to replace it,
but I'm sorry. I forgot.

199
00:13:31,158 --> 00:13:33,334
Huh, you'd be amazed

200
00:13:33,377 --> 00:13:34,988
at the things
you can forget.

 [ engine turns off ]

202
00:13:53,310 --> 00:13:56,096
No, wait. Please.

00:13:59,882 --> 00:14:01,579
[ sighs ]
Okay.

204
00:14:02,885 --> 00:14:05,192
How did you find me
at the hospital?

205
00:14:07,324 --> 00:14:10,110
You were on your way
to San Diego to visit
your brother Tom.

206
00:14:10,153 --> 00:14:12,460
I called to make sure
you got there safely

207
00:14:12,503 --> 00:14:14,027
and he said
you never made it.

208
00:14:14,070 --> 00:14:16,943
I got worried,
I called the police,

209
00:14:16,986 --> 00:14:18,770
and they said that they'd
just brought a woman in

210
00:14:18,814 --> 00:14:20,685
to City General
that was amnesiac.

211
00:14:20,729 --> 00:14:23,427
She matched
your description.

212
00:14:23,471 --> 00:14:26,256
Jane's voice: 
Okay, it sounds possible.

213
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:30,347
Jane, you-- you--
don't push yourself
trying to remember.

214
00:14:30,391 --> 00:14:33,742
Dr. Melloff said
it's all gonna come back,

215
00:14:33,785 --> 00:14:36,919
- but you have to relax.
- Right.

216
00:14:36,963 --> 00:14:39,487
I know it must be
strange, you know,

217
00:14:39,530 --> 00:14:42,272
all of this
and particularly me,

218
00:14:42,316 --> 00:14:45,928
but...
I wanna say this

219
00:14:45,972 --> 00:14:49,062
and I'm not gonna say it again
until you're ready to hear it.

220
00:14:49,105 --> 00:14:51,107
 I love you.

221
00:14:51,151 --> 00:14:53,327
 We have 
a great life together.

222
00:14:53,370 --> 00:14:55,677
We're gonna get it back.

At least I have good taste.

225
00:15:08,951 --> 00:15:10,300
You okay?

226
00:15:11,432 --> 00:15:13,608
One brother,
no sisters?

227
00:15:13,651 --> 00:15:16,089
And your father died
when you were 11

228
00:15:16,132 --> 00:15:17,568
and you were very close
to your mother.

229
00:15:17,612 --> 00:15:19,309
- Were?
- Are.

230
00:15:19,353 --> 00:15:21,442
- You said "were."
- Let's wait on this.

231
00:15:21,485 --> 00:15:23,357
Is she dead?

232
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:26,012
[ sighs ]
She died in
an accident last year.

233
00:15:26,055 --> 00:15:28,057
She was driving your car.

234
00:15:28,101 --> 00:15:30,799
Some guy ran a light.

235
00:15:30,842 --> 00:15:32,366
She died instantly.

236
00:15:33,584 --> 00:15:34,803
I'm sorry.

237
00:15:36,109 --> 00:15:37,937
Well, come on.

240
00:15:46,510 --> 00:15:49,861
- Who's that?
- That's Carole Garson.
She's a good friend.

241
00:15:49,905 --> 00:15:51,863
 She's lived over there 
almost as long as we have.

242
00:15:55,215 --> 00:15:57,521
She's going through
a rough time right now.

243
00:15:57,565 --> 00:16:00,133
Her husband Daniel
moved out a few months ago.

244
00:16:00,176 --> 00:16:02,004
Left her alone
with two teenagers.

245
00:16:02,048 --> 00:16:03,223

is going senile.

 [ door closes ]

I gather I wasn't modest.

248
00:16:22,285 --> 00:16:24,026
Oh, I had that done.

249
00:16:24,070 --> 00:16:27,029
 You never liked it, 
but I love it.

250
00:16:36,734 --> 00:16:38,998
Well, here's
a tough one.

251
00:16:40,651 --> 00:16:42,610
Do we have
any children?

252

Yes.

Where is she?

Michael: 
She's staying 
with my parents.

257
00:16:53,229 --> 00:16:55,492
 I think we ought to 
let her stay there 
for a while

258
00:16:55,536 --> 00:16:58,887
until, you know--
until this is over.

259
00:17:06,112 --> 00:17:08,897
The doctor said
you shouldn't actively
try to remember things.

260

Why not?

261
00:17:10,551 --> 00:17:12,074
You know,
I keep thinking if I--

262

if I look at something,

263
00:17:13,989 --> 00:17:17,297
[ stammering ]
then I might think
of something

264
00:17:17,340 --> 00:17:18,907
 and it'll all come back.

00:17:24,391 --> 00:17:26,741

and undress myself.

a little more comfortable.

The only way this thing
is gonna get fixed

is if you take this

to get as much rest
as possible.

She's in love with Michael.

353
00:22:17,379 --> 00:22:19,381
Jane's voice: 
Oh, Amy, do you miss me?

354
00:22:22,253 --> 00:22:24,386
Come on.
Medication and nap.

355
00:22:24,430 --> 00:22:27,563
- But I just got up.
- That was hours ago.

356
00:22:39,053 --> 00:22:40,794
Here you go.

357
00:22:40,837 --> 00:22:42,404
Oh, I don't want
any more pills.

358
00:22:42,448 --> 00:22:44,058
They make me feel
like I'm underwater.

359
00:22:44,101 --> 00:22:45,407
Please take them.

360
00:22:45,451 --> 00:22:47,191
Dr. Ravenson
thinks it's important.

361
00:22:57,941 --> 00:22:59,943
Thank you.

362
00:23:09,562 --> 00:23:13,653
I take it every Wednesday.
It's a great class to do.

363
00:23:13,696 --> 00:23:15,350
Oh, I'll take
the class.

364
00:23:15,394 --> 00:23:17,657
Okay.
All right.

365
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:19,615
- [ horn honks ]
- Watch out.

366
00:23:19,659 --> 00:23:22,096
Turn on your lights, jerk!

367
00:23:22,139 --> 00:23:23,880
- Shh!
- [ brakes screech ]

368
00:23:25,882 --> 00:23:28,668
Hey! Mind your own
damn business!

369
00:23:28,711 --> 00:23:31,061
- You mind yours!
- All right, come on.
Let's get out of here.

370
00:23:31,105 --> 00:23:32,498
Come on. Come on!

371
00:23:32,541 --> 00:23:34,891
 [ echoes ] 
You wanna get us killed?

372
00:23:36,937 --> 00:23:39,069

373
00:23:40,593 --> 00:23:42,290
[ both screaming ]

374
00:23:42,333 --> 00:23:44,945
 [ phone ringing ]

375
00:23:51,255 --> 00:23:54,128
- Hello?
- [ ringing continues ]

376
00:23:57,740 --> 00:23:59,699
Paula: 
Mrs. Ravenson 
isn't in right now.

377
00:23:59,742 --> 00:24:02,179
She's visiting her brother
for a few weeks.

378
00:24:02,223 --> 00:24:04,834
All right.
Thank you.

379
00:24:06,532 --> 00:24:09,012
- Who was that?
- I don't know.

380
00:24:09,056 --> 00:24:10,971
Some-- someone
named Sarah.

381
00:24:11,014 --> 00:24:14,061
Well, why did you say
I was visiting my brother?

382
00:24:14,104 --> 00:24:17,499
Well, Dr. Ravenson said
you shouldn't be disturbed
by phone calls right now.

383
00:24:17,543 --> 00:24:19,632
Well, what if I wanna talk
to that person?

384
00:24:19,675 --> 00:24:22,243
Wait till you get
your strength back.

385
00:24:22,286 --> 00:24:25,376
There's nothing wrong
with my strength.
It's my memory.

386
00:24:25,420 --> 00:24:30,164
Then what's the point
of talking with someone
you can't remember?

387
00:24:33,123 --> 00:24:36,997
And then this maniac
starts backing up full speed

388
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:39,129
and tries to run us over.

389
00:24:39,173 --> 00:24:41,218
That's not a dream.

390
00:24:41,262 --> 00:24:42,742
It really happened.

391
00:24:44,221 --> 00:24:46,485
I've always had
this violent temper.

392
00:24:46,528 --> 00:24:48,530
I was always afraid
it was gonna get you
into trouble.

393
00:24:48,574 --> 00:24:51,272
 And this one night, 
it almost got you 
and Sarah killed.

394
00:24:51,315 --> 00:24:53,666
But I only told the guy
his lights were off.

395
00:24:53,709 --> 00:24:56,538
- He went berserk.
- Well, a lot of nuts
out there,

396
00:24:56,582 --> 00:24:58,932
but this is a good sign.

397
00:24:58,975 --> 00:25:02,196
It means that
pieces of your memory
are coming back.

398
00:25:03,502 --> 00:25:05,373
But, Michael,
these pills.

399
00:25:05,416 --> 00:25:07,636
I feel so rotten.
I feel like I'm underwater.

400
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:11,118
My mouth is dry,
I have bad dreams.

401
00:25:11,161 --> 00:25:13,076
Say no more.

402
00:25:19,039 --> 00:25:21,824

 [ line ringing ]

404
00:25:25,219 --> 00:25:27,438
- Hello?
- Yeah, hi, Dr. Melloff.

405
00:25:27,482 --> 00:25:29,832
I'm sorry to
bother you so late.
This is Michael Ravenson.

406
00:25:29,876 --> 00:25:32,269
- Yes, Michael. 
How can I help?
- Uh, listen,

407
00:25:32,313 --> 00:25:34,489
Jane's having a problem
with the medication.

408
00:25:34,533 --> 00:25:37,927
 She's not so comfortable. 
What do you think's 
going on?

409
00:25:37,971 --> 00:25:41,583
- Is she sleeping?
- Yeah, well, that's
all she's doing.

410
00:25:41,627 --> 00:25:44,847
Dr. Melloff: 
It's not the medication. 
I think it's her system.

411
00:25:44,891 --> 00:25:47,589
 Michael, she has to understand 
it's going to take time.

412
00:25:47,633 --> 00:25:50,244
 The important thing 
is not to let her get upset.

413
00:25:50,287 --> 00:25:51,898
Michael: 
And that's it?

414
00:25:51,941 --> 00:25:53,987
 I think so for now.

415
00:25:54,030 --> 00:25:55,858
All right, thank you.

416
00:25:55,902 --> 00:25:57,947
 Okay, just call 
if you have any 
further problems.

417
00:25:57,991 --> 00:26:00,559
Will do. Night.

418
00:26:01,690 --> 00:26:02,691

420
00:26:12,614 --> 00:26:14,137
- Hi.
- Hi.

421
00:26:14,181 --> 00:26:15,878
Um, this is
a little clumsy.

422
00:26:15,922 --> 00:26:18,707
Um, Michael told me
we were friends

423
00:26:18,751 --> 00:26:22,189
and I needed
to talk to someone.

424
00:26:22,232 --> 00:26:23,973
- I escaped.
- From what?

425
00:26:24,017 --> 00:26:26,062
- Paula,
- Oh.

426
00:26:26,106 --> 00:26:28,543
the woman Michael hired
to babysit me.

427
00:26:28,587 --> 00:26:30,110
Uh-huh.

428
00:26:30,153 --> 00:26:33,635
You take, uh, cream,
no sugar, right?

429
00:26:33,679 --> 00:26:35,811
Huh, I don't know.

430
00:26:35,855 --> 00:26:38,553
You really can't
remember anything?

431
00:26:38,597 --> 00:26:42,296
Well, neither can I,
but I can't blame mine
on trauma.

432
00:26:42,339 --> 00:26:44,646
I think you take cream.

433
00:26:47,867 --> 00:26:50,652
- Hey.
- Oh, hi, Mrs. Ravenson.

434
00:26:50,696 --> 00:26:52,393
- Hi.
- Hey, I'm out of here.

435
00:26:52,436 --> 00:26:54,482
Hold it, hold it.

436
00:26:54,525 --> 00:26:56,179
Aren't you supposed to
take your grandpa
for a walk first?

437
00:26:56,223 --> 00:26:58,747
- Mom, I'm late.
- You're late.

438
00:26:58,791 --> 00:27:00,923
- Yeah! Celine will do it.
- Carole: Oh, yeah, sure, 
Celine will do it.

439
00:27:00,967 --> 00:27:03,447
Do you see
Celine anywhere? Oh!

440
00:27:03,491 --> 00:27:05,972
This is my job.
My job is I'm supposed
to take care of everything

441
00:27:06,015 --> 00:27:07,277
because nobody else
can do anything.

442
00:27:07,321 --> 00:27:09,671
Do you see Celine?
I don't see Celine.

443
00:27:09,715 --> 00:27:11,673
- No, look, if this
isn't a good time, I can--
- Oh, please, Jane,

444
00:27:11,717 --> 00:27:13,719
- there's no good time.
- I'm sorry.

445
00:27:13,762 --> 00:27:15,938
- I'm-- I'm really sorry.
- Are you?

446
00:27:17,157 --> 00:27:18,985
Do you remember Daniel?

447
00:27:19,028 --> 00:27:21,378

ex-husband Daniel?

[ scoffs ]
Wow, that's amazing.

450
00:27:25,992 --> 00:27:28,821
You used to
go running with him
every morning.

451
00:27:28,864 --> 00:27:30,518
Oh, Michael told me.

452
00:27:30,561 --> 00:27:32,999
You're a very
lucky woman, Jane.

453
00:27:33,042 --> 00:27:35,436
You're married
to the perfect man.

454
00:27:35,479 --> 00:27:38,178
- That seems so...
- [ chuckles ]

455
00:27:38,221 --> 00:27:41,529

how perfect, do you?

Excuse me,
I have to get the door.

459
00:27:47,970 --> 00:27:50,146
Probably not as chaotic
over at your house.

- I think this must be
your keeper.
- Where have you been?

465
00:28:00,722 --> 00:28:02,376
You don't even tell me
you're leaving the house.

466
00:28:02,419 --> 00:28:04,378
I go to give you
your medication,
you're not there.

467
00:28:04,421 --> 00:28:05,814
I didn't think I needed
to ask permission--

468
00:28:05,858 --> 00:28:07,337
Dr. Ravenson trusts me
to take care of you.

469
00:28:07,381 --> 00:28:08,730
Didn't you think
I'd be frightened?

470
00:28:08,774 --> 00:28:10,819
 I've been up and down 
the street.

471
00:28:10,863 --> 00:28:12,168
- Been looking 
for you everywhere!
- Okay, okay, okay.

00:28:12,212 --> 00:28:13,692
Paula, I'm sorry.

473
00:28:16,956 --> 00:28:18,740
Thanks for the coffee.

Why are you calling
Dr. Melloff?

535
00:32:13,627 --> 00:32:16,935
I need to know
what he prescribed for me.

536
00:32:16,978 --> 00:32:18,588
Well, I told you Ativan.

537
00:32:18,632 --> 00:32:20,895
No, my heart is racing.
Something's wrong.

538
00:32:20,939 --> 00:32:23,550
Oh, darling,
it's your body

539
00:32:23,593 --> 00:32:24,899

that you need some rest.

540
00:32:24,943 --> 00:32:26,422
Now, come here.
Don't fight it.

No, Paula--
Paula hid it.

546
00:32:37,085 --> 00:32:38,695
Well, then we'll talk
to Paula.

547
00:32:38,739 --> 00:32:40,219
But, sweetheart,
why do you need
your address book?

548
00:32:42,003 --> 00:32:43,962
'Cause maybe I need
to call my friends.

being cooped up here all day

00:32:51,491 --> 00:32:52,927
She takes me
to the bathroom.

552
00:32:52,971 --> 00:32:54,407
She doesn't let me
answer the phone.

553
00:32:54,450 --> 00:32:56,191
She tells my friends
I'm not home.

554
00:32:56,235 --> 00:32:57,671
- She watches and watches.
- Darling, that's my fault.

555
00:32:57,714 --> 00:32:59,934
I told Paula
not to let you take calls.

556
00:32:59,978 --> 00:33:03,068
I didn't want you
to be embarrassed
in front of your friends.

557
00:33:04,983 --> 00:33:08,160
Now, that's my fault and I'm--
I'm very sorry.

Something's wrong,
Michael.

I'm not getting better.

560
00:33:16,037 --> 00:33:18,909
Maybe I need to see a doctor,
a psychiatrist.

561
00:33:18,953 --> 00:33:21,390
- I can't-- I can't remember.
- All right, sweetheart.

562
00:33:21,434 --> 00:33:23,044
I'll make an appointment.
Come on.

If you don't like Paula,
I'll get rid of her.

we'll invite them over.

this is happening to us.

to make this thing go away.

 There is nothing I can do 
about it right now.

 She'll be all right. 
Just give her a big hug

692
00:40:18,894 --> 00:40:22,289
I'm, uh,
taking Andrew to camp.

693
00:40:22,332 --> 00:40:25,074
Hey, bud.
It's not gonna fit
in the trunk.

694
00:40:25,118 --> 00:40:27,425
- Why don't you just lay it
in the backseat?
- Okay.

695
00:40:27,468 --> 00:40:29,165
Is that your
new philosophy, Daniel?

696
00:40:29,209 --> 00:40:31,429
Laying them
in the backseat?

697
00:40:31,472 --> 00:40:33,996
You know, we could do
without the sarcasm
for a few minutes.

698
00:40:34,040 --> 00:40:35,998
Look, I'm gonna
go inside now.

699
00:40:36,042 --> 00:40:39,611
Oh, don't let
a little spousal tension
scare you away, Jane.

700
00:40:39,654 --> 00:40:42,135
No, it's just that
I'm feeling a little weak.

701
00:40:42,178 --> 00:40:44,093
- I better go.
- Oh, yes. Yes, I know.

702
00:40:47,357 --> 00:40:49,621
Call me if you need
anything, okay?

703
00:40:49,664 --> 00:40:51,405
Oh, I'm sure she will.

704
00:40:51,449 --> 00:40:54,016
Jane's very needy these days,
aren't you, dear?

705
00:40:57,803 --> 00:40:59,892
 [ car door closes ]

706
00:40:59,935 --> 00:41:02,416
- Carole?
- [ car engine starts ]

707
00:41:05,593 --> 00:41:07,160
What was that about?

708
00:41:07,203 --> 00:41:09,510
[ scoffs ]
Go home, Jane,

709
00:41:09,554 --> 00:41:11,469
before I say something
I really regret.

710
00:41:11,512 --> 00:41:14,515
- Like what?
- Like telling you
what I think of you.

711
00:41:14,559 --> 00:41:17,518
[ sighs ]
You were my friend,
for God's sake,

712
00:41:17,562 --> 00:41:19,955
and you made
a complete fool
out of me.

713
00:41:19,999 --> 00:41:21,653
H-how? What did I do?

714
00:41:21,696 --> 00:41:24,133
Oh, just cut
the innocent crap, will you?

715
00:41:24,177 --> 00:41:26,527
I know all about
your affair with my husband

716
00:41:26,571 --> 00:41:28,311
and so does Michael.

717
00:41:34,796 --> 00:41:37,190
- Let's go inside.
- No.

718
00:41:40,323 --> 00:41:41,760
Jane.

719
00:41:44,589 --> 00:41:46,199
No, no!

720
00:41:46,242 --> 00:41:48,288
You know what?
I'm gonna make you
a nice bath.

721
00:41:48,331 --> 00:41:50,333
 I'm gonna make you 
a cup of tea.

722
00:41:50,377 --> 00:41:52,553
- You can sit up
in the sunroom.
- No, I'm leaving.

723
00:41:52,597 --> 00:41:54,294
- Hey, it's okay.
- No.

724
00:41:54,337 --> 00:41:56,296
- Sit in the sunroom.
- No, get away from me!

725
00:41:58,037 --> 00:41:59,473
Okay.

726
00:42:01,606 --> 00:42:03,869
Jane's voice: 
So that's what this is about.

727
00:42:03,912 --> 00:42:05,435
 This is who you are.

728
00:42:05,479 --> 00:42:07,307
 You cheat on your-- 
on your husband.

729
00:42:07,350 --> 00:42:10,179
 You cheat-- 
cheat on your best friend.

730
00:42:16,403 --> 00:42:17,839
 Pat Rutherford.

731
00:42:17,883 --> 00:42:19,580
 Oh, my God, 
Pat Rutherford.

732
00:42:19,624 --> 00:42:21,582
 Room 20.

733
00:42:21,626 --> 00:42:22,757
 A motel?

734
00:42:22,801 --> 00:42:24,237
 Was it a motel?

735
00:42:24,280 --> 00:42:27,109
 Oh, God, Michael.

736
00:42:27,153 --> 00:42:28,415
 I'm sorry.

737
00:42:39,818 --> 00:42:41,950
 What are these 
doing here?

738
00:42:45,475 --> 00:42:48,174
 Someone hid them 
from me.

739
00:42:49,567 --> 00:42:51,003
 Why?

740
00:42:52,439 --> 00:42:53,701
 Why?

741
00:42:57,705 --> 00:42:59,359
My purse.

742
00:43:08,847 --> 00:43:10,413
- Oh, no.
- Jane.

743
00:43:10,457 --> 00:43:11,850
- It's all right.
- No. No, I'm leaving.

744
00:43:11,893 --> 00:43:14,156
Oh, sweetheart,
you're hysterical.
Paula!

- Let me go!
- You're hysterical.

Nobody's telling me
the truth!

747
00:43:17,203 --> 00:43:18,421
It's all right.
Give me your arm.

748
00:43:18,465 --> 00:43:20,510
- Give me your arm.
- No.

749
00:43:20,554 --> 00:43:22,164
Hold still.

750
00:43:22,208 --> 00:43:23,513
 That's right.

751
00:43:23,557 --> 00:43:25,341
 You'll be fine.

752
00:43:25,385 --> 00:43:27,213
 You'll be fine.

753
00:43:29,955 --> 00:43:31,652
 
It's okay.

Michael: 
Well, uh, you didn't 
make her feel bad, did you?

755

Paula: 
Oh, no, no. 
[ laughs ]

756
00:43:48,103 --> 00:43:50,366
- Oh, stop.
- No, I just didn't know
that would happen.

757
00:43:50,410 --> 00:43:52,412
- That's not true.
- Oh, she said I--

758
00:43:52,455 --> 00:43:54,936
But, I mean, was she aware
that you were watching?

759
00:43:54,980 --> 00:43:57,243
Yes, she was aware.

760
00:43:57,286 --> 00:43:59,985
- She-- she knew you were...
- She knew I was absolutely
watching.

Perfect for you, 
Michael, isn't it?

763
00:44:05,599 --> 00:44:07,296
 Get rid of Jane.

764
00:44:08,515 --> 00:44:11,257
Jane:
Hello? Um, who is this?

765
00:44:11,300 --> 00:44:13,607
Woman: 
Who is this? 
You called me.

766

Uh, this is Jane.

00:44:15,783 --> 00:44:19,004
Um, is Tom there?

00:44:19,047 --> 00:44:21,789
Jane, it's Ellie.

00:44:21,833 --> 00:44:23,704
You sound so peculiar.

Well, I--
I just got over the flu.

771
00:44:27,316 --> 00:44:29,536
Um, I need to talk
to Tom.

772
00:44:29,579 --> 00:44:32,017
 You know Tom doesn't get home 
till after 10:00.

773
00:44:32,060 --> 00:44:33,888
Right.
Oh, right, right.

Um, Ellie,

775
00:44:35,585 --> 00:44:38,937
did Michael call

776
00:44:38,980 --> 00:44:41,461
and ask if I was there?

777
00:44:41,504 --> 00:44:44,899
Why would he ask
if you were here?

778
00:44:44,943 --> 00:44:47,206
Ellie, please,
you gotta listen.

779
00:44:47,249 --> 00:44:49,251
Something--
something's happened to me

00:44:49,295 --> 00:44:52,777
[ stammering ]
and I can't remember
who I am

781
00:44:52,820 --> 00:44:55,388
and it's very hard
for me to focus.

 [ dog barks ]

783
00:44:57,216 --> 00:44:59,871
Jane, is Michael there?

784
00:44:59,914 --> 00:45:02,482
- Can I speak to him?
- No, no, you just
have to listen.

785
00:45:02,525 --> 00:45:05,267
You have to listen.
Now-- now, Michael
told the police

00:45:05,311 --> 00:45:08,096
that, um-- that, um,

787
00:45:08,140 --> 00:45:11,621
I went to visit
my brother in San Diego.

788
00:45:11,665 --> 00:45:13,275
But then I found
my purse.

789
00:45:13,319 --> 00:45:16,583
 How could I have gone 
to San Diego

790
00:45:16,626 --> 00:45:19,238
 if I didn't have my purse 
with all my ID?

791

You've gotta tell Tom
to come and get me.

You've gotta tell him
to come and get me right now.

what's going on?

I'm sorry
to get you involved.

797

I didn't wanna worry
you and Tom.

798
00:45:35,645 --> 00:45:37,386
Jane's having
some kind of breakdown.

799
00:45:37,430 --> 00:45:39,258
I think it's related
to the accident.

800
00:45:39,301 --> 00:45:41,216
 She's under doctor's care

801
00:45:41,260 --> 00:45:42,478
 and we're doing 
the best we can.

 Don't wanna worry you

803
00:45:44,176 --> 00:45:45,917
 and they say 
she's gonna be fine,

804
00:45:45,960 --> 00:45:48,049
 so, okay, don't worry.

805
00:45:48,093 --> 00:45:49,964
 Give my best to Tom, 
please.

806
00:45:50,008 --> 00:45:52,358
 I'll talk to you later.

807

Excuse me.
Can I help you?

808
00:46:12,770 --> 00:46:15,903
Um, yes.
Can you tell me
what these are?

809
00:46:18,079 --> 00:46:19,689
Where'd you get these?

810
00:46:20,952 --> 00:46:22,823
They're Ativan, right?

811
00:46:22,867 --> 00:46:24,651
Who told you
they were Ativan?

812
00:46:26,131 --> 00:46:28,220
Well,
what are they, then?

813
00:46:28,263 --> 00:46:30,091
It's Haldol.

814
00:46:30,135 --> 00:46:32,006
Something you don't
wanna mess with.

815
00:46:32,050 --> 00:46:34,356
 Listen, you haven't 
been taking these, 
have you,

816
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:35,836
 without a prescription?

817
00:46:35,880 --> 00:46:37,664
Well, I had trouble
sleeping

818
00:46:37,707 --> 00:46:40,362
and a friend
gave them to me.

819
00:46:42,190 --> 00:46:44,018
First,
get rid of the pills,

820
00:46:44,062 --> 00:46:45,541
then you get rid
of the friend.

821
00:46:45,585 --> 00:46:47,152
 Otherwise, 
it can cause you

822
00:46:47,195 --> 00:46:49,197
 severe, 
irreversible symptoms--

823
00:46:49,241 --> 00:46:52,244
 uncontrollable movements 
like Parkinson's disease.

824
00:46:52,287 --> 00:46:55,813
Haldol is a drug
of last resort
for psychosis.

825

Jane?

826
00:47:12,786 --> 00:47:14,875
- What is it?
- Don't you touch me.

827
00:47:14,919 --> 00:47:17,617
 Just stay away.

828
00:47:17,660 --> 00:47:20,011
What are you trying
to do to me?

829
00:47:21,360 --> 00:47:23,579
Dr. Melloff
prescribed Ativan.

830
00:47:23,623 --> 00:47:25,843
You've been giving me
Haldol.

831
00:47:25,886 --> 00:47:27,409
Haldol?

832
00:47:27,453 --> 00:47:29,063
You tell me
this is Ativan?

833
00:47:35,069 --> 00:47:37,593
Jane, where did you
get this?

834
00:47:37,637 --> 00:47:39,378
Huh? Did you get these
from my bag?

835
00:47:39,421 --> 00:47:41,641
Oh, now you're saying
that you didn't
give that to me?

836
00:47:41,684 --> 00:47:43,512
Of course I didn't
give these to you.
What, you think I'm crazy?

837
00:47:43,556 --> 00:47:46,124
- No, I think you're lying!
- Jane, why would I lie to you?

838
00:47:46,167 --> 00:47:49,388
What happened between us,
Michael, that you don't
want me to remember?

839
00:47:49,431 --> 00:47:50,998
What happened?

840
00:47:53,435 --> 00:47:55,394
Jane, I don't think
you should push this

841
00:47:55,437 --> 00:47:57,091
- until you're 
feeling better.
- No, no, no.

842
00:47:57,135 --> 00:47:58,701
I'm not gonna wait
until my brain is fried

843
00:47:58,745 --> 00:48:00,442
and I can't think
anymore!

844
00:48:03,968 --> 00:48:06,144
Michael, when I was
wandering the streets
that day,

845
00:48:06,187 --> 00:48:09,060
I-- I found

846
00:48:09,103 --> 00:48:11,627
hundred-dollar bills
in my pockets

847
00:48:11,671 --> 00:48:14,065
and my dress was covered
with blood.

848
00:48:16,937 --> 00:48:18,678
Does that ring a bell?

849
00:48:20,158 --> 00:48:22,377
What about the blood,
Michael?

850
00:48:22,421 --> 00:48:24,989
Where did the blood
come from?

851
00:48:27,426 --> 00:48:29,471
All right, look.
A year ago...

852
00:48:31,212 --> 00:48:33,301
[ sighs ]
...when your mother
was killed,

853
00:48:33,345 --> 00:48:36,217
you went into
a severe depression

854
00:48:36,261 --> 00:48:39,525
 and the doctors called it 
survivor's guilt.

855
00:48:39,568 --> 00:48:42,354
They prescribed Haldol.

856
00:48:42,397 --> 00:48:45,009
 It worked.

857
00:48:45,052 --> 00:48:46,706
For a while,
everything seemed okay.

858
00:48:46,749 --> 00:48:48,534
You--
yeah, you even

859
00:48:48,577 --> 00:48:52,277
started running
with Daniel next door
a few days a week.

860
00:48:53,713 --> 00:48:56,237
 And then it was 
every day.

861
00:48:56,281 --> 00:48:58,196
 And then,

862
00:48:58,239 --> 00:49:01,242
well, running
wasn't enough.

It was from
our joint account.

866
00:49:13,472 --> 00:49:16,301
The bank called me and said
that you'd withdrawn $10,000,

867
00:49:16,344 --> 00:49:18,085
 closed the account.

868
00:49:18,129 --> 00:49:20,087
 I assumed that 
you were running off

869
00:49:20,131 --> 00:49:22,611
with one of your lovers.

870
00:49:22,655 --> 00:49:23,917
I came running home.

871
00:49:23,961 --> 00:49:25,484
You were hysterical.

872
00:49:25,527 --> 00:49:26,876
You were packing.

873

leaving me.

Said that I didn't deserve
to live with someone
like you.

875
00:49:31,359 --> 00:49:32,970
I argued, I said no.

876
00:49:33,013 --> 00:49:34,797
We fought, you hit me.

877
00:49:34,841 --> 00:49:38,062
And there was blood
everywhere.

878
00:49:42,066 --> 00:49:44,198
You said
survivor's guilt.

879
00:49:46,461 --> 00:49:49,160
Was I in the car
with my mother?

You were driving.

You were in a hurry.

882
00:50:00,432 --> 00:50:03,522
You, uh,
missed a turn.

883
00:50:03,565 --> 00:50:07,091
Witnesses said
that you didn't signal

884
00:50:07,134 --> 00:50:09,702
and some car

885

the passenger side.

- No.

- Nothing.

She's not in any pain.

I don't understand this.

I mean, I know
she suffered
a major trauma,

916
00:51:49,193 --> 00:51:50,933
but this is Jane,
for God's sake.

917
00:51:50,977 --> 00:51:52,631
- Shh.
- She's always
been in control.

918

She's always been--

Please.

She's not
getting better.

922
00:52:01,944 --> 00:52:03,859
She can barely
open her eyes.

923
00:52:03,903 --> 00:52:08,168
Michael, maybe you shouldn't
be caring for her at home.

924
00:52:08,212 --> 00:52:09,735
Why not?

925
00:52:09,778 --> 00:52:12,085
I just think she might
get better care

Peter, I'm not
putting Jane anywhere.

my friend who thought
she was pregnant?

935

Turns out it was
early menopause.

Is that disgusting?

937
00:52:34,368 --> 00:52:35,935
Men can start
a family at 80,

938
00:52:35,978 --> 00:52:38,764
but women are
washed up at 40.

1040
00:58:55,923 --> 00:58:57,534
- I want the bathroom.
- Okay.

1041
00:58:57,577 --> 00:58:59,492
- I'll be sick.
- All right.

are you doing?

00:59:13,288 --> 00:59:14,333
Oh!

- Get back here!

Please.

Coming!

- Hi.
- Hi.

- Come on in.

I know I should've
called first,

1057

but I just wanted
to apologize

1058
01:00:31,018 --> 01:00:32,977
for being so out of it
the other day.

1059
01:00:33,020 --> 01:00:35,414
- You were so nice.
- Oh, you don't have to
apologize.

1060
01:00:35,457 --> 01:00:36,850
Don't be silly.

1061

Been on any more
field trips?

1062
01:00:38,852 --> 01:00:41,333
Uh, we had a tour
of the fire department,

1063
01:00:41,376 --> 01:00:43,683
but everyone there
was disgustingly
well-behaved.

- [ chuckles ]
- We missed you.

1065
01:00:45,206 --> 01:00:48,427
- Oh.
- Jane, I am so sorry,

1066
01:00:48,470 --> 01:00:49,733
but I have
an appointment.

1067
01:00:49,776 --> 01:00:51,865
Oh, no, no, I--
I should've--

1068
01:00:51,909 --> 01:00:54,128
- I should've
called you first.
- Oh, no problem!

1069
01:00:59,743 --> 01:01:02,354
Don't you love
this new picture?

1070
01:01:02,397 --> 01:01:05,226
I wish they could have
Mrs. Rutherford every year.

Pat.

1072
01:01:07,359 --> 01:01:08,839
Rutherford?

1073
01:01:08,882 --> 01:01:11,406
- Yes, their teacher.
- This year.

to watch them change 
from year to year.

- Second grade 
just blew right by.

 Oh, Amy, 
you're alive.

I need you
to believe me.

I'm right about this.

I'm right
about this, Carole.

- Jane. Jane, I am not
gonna talk to him.

You don't have to.
I will.

Just get on that phone
and listen.

- No!
- Do it!

- Hello?
- Hello, Daniel.

- Yeah.
- This is Jane,
Jane Ravenson.

1090
01:01:58,671 --> 01:02:00,542
 Jane. I'm sorry.

1091
01:02:00,586 --> 01:02:02,631
 I didn't even 
recognize your voice.

1092
01:02:02,675 --> 01:02:04,242
- How you feeling?
- Better.

1093
01:02:04,285 --> 01:02:05,809
Thanks.

1094
01:02:05,852 --> 01:02:08,246
Daniel, I need
to ask you something

1095
01:02:08,289 --> 01:02:10,770
 and it's gonna sound 
peculiar.

1096
01:02:10,814 --> 01:02:12,511
But I need you
to answer me...

1097
01:02:12,554 --> 01:02:14,078
...honestly.

1098
01:02:15,906 --> 01:02:19,823
- Did we ever have an affair?
- [ chuckles ] What?

1099
01:02:19,866 --> 01:02:21,041
Jane: 
I'm serious.

1100
01:02:21,085 --> 01:02:23,609
Did we ever have
an affair?

1101

 Oh, God, not again.

1102
01:02:25,567 --> 01:02:27,744
- Has Carole been telling you--
- No, it's just me asking.

1103

Yes or no?

1104
01:02:32,879 --> 01:02:34,533
 No.

1105
01:02:34,576 --> 01:02:35,752
 Of course we didn't.

1106
01:02:42,367 --> 01:02:44,021
Thank you.

1107
01:02:44,064 --> 01:02:46,327
 Do you mind telling me 
what's going on?

I will, I will.
Later.

Later.
Thank you, Daniel.

Thank you.

1111
01:03:01,734 --> 01:03:03,910
He didn't know
you were on.

1112
01:03:07,871 --> 01:03:10,612
He'd have
no reason to lie.

1113
01:03:10,656 --> 01:03:14,268
Was it Michael that told you
about the affair?

1114
01:03:17,924 --> 01:03:19,752
Yeah.

1115
01:03:19,796 --> 01:03:22,668
Who was driving the car
when my mother was killed?

1116
01:03:22,711 --> 01:03:24,278
Your mother.

1117
01:03:24,322 --> 01:03:27,107
Michael told me
that I was driving.

1118
01:03:27,151 --> 01:03:29,631
That I killed
my mother and Amy.

1119
01:03:29,675 --> 01:03:32,852
- What?
- He told me
that Amy died in my arms.

Oh, Jane, come on.

1121
01:03:34,811 --> 01:03:37,161
Amy's alive,
isn't she?

1122
01:03:37,204 --> 01:03:40,294
Of course she is!
Listen to yourself.

1123
01:03:40,338 --> 01:03:41,861
Where is he keeping her?

1124
01:03:41,905 --> 01:03:44,733
Um, uh, she's
at his parents' house.

1125
01:03:44,777 --> 01:03:46,648
He's hiding her
from me, Carole.

1126
01:03:46,692 --> 01:03:49,390
 No, look, look, look, 
he's lied to everyone.

- [ exhales ]
- He told--

1128
01:03:51,088 --> 01:03:53,133
he told you that Daniel and I
were having an affair.

1129
01:03:53,177 --> 01:03:55,614
He told me that I killed
my own child.

1130
01:03:55,657 --> 01:03:57,398
 And then he kept me 
so drugged,

1131
01:03:57,442 --> 01:03:59,357
 I couldn't put 
two thoughts together.

1132
01:03:59,400 --> 01:04:01,098
Even my own friends
began to believe

1133
01:04:01,141 --> 01:04:02,534
that I should be
committed.

1134
01:04:05,667 --> 01:04:08,061
You believe me,
don't you?

1135
01:04:08,105 --> 01:04:11,412
[ stammering ]
I don't know what to believe.

1136
01:04:11,456 --> 01:04:13,980
Why would Michael
be doing these things? Why?

1137
01:04:14,024 --> 01:04:15,895
Because I know
something!

1138
01:04:15,939 --> 01:04:17,636
- What?
- I don't know.

1139
01:04:17,679 --> 01:04:20,639
But I must've
seen something

1140
01:04:20,682 --> 01:04:22,206
or something happened

1141
01:04:22,249 --> 01:04:25,600
that-- that he doesn't
want me to remember.

1142
01:04:27,864 --> 01:04:30,475
Please.
You've gotta help me
get to Amy.

01:04:30,518 --> 01:04:33,826
- Look, Jane--
- Jane.

1144
01:04:33,870 --> 01:04:35,219
Jane, you are
driving me crazy.

1145
01:04:35,262 --> 01:04:37,047
- Get up right now!
- Let go of me!

1146
01:04:37,090 --> 01:04:38,875
I don't wanna hear
what you have to say!

1147

[ thuds ]

1148
01:05:17,087 --> 01:05:19,959
Amy, you've hardly
touched your food.

1149
01:05:20,003 --> 01:05:22,875
- Here you go.
- But it's too much
cholesterol.

1150
01:05:22,919 --> 01:05:25,225
Besides,
I'm not hungry.

1151
01:05:25,269 --> 01:05:26,531
Honey, who taught you
that word?

1152
01:05:26,574 --> 01:05:29,186
Did Daddy
teach you that word?

1153
01:05:31,492 --> 01:05:33,320
So what's
your day like today?

1154
01:05:33,364 --> 01:05:37,803
Well, I have an appointment
with Amy's teacher at 12:30.

1155
01:05:37,846 --> 01:05:39,239
Michael: 
Mm, problems?

1156
01:05:39,283 --> 01:05:41,502
No, just an
end-of-the-year
conference.

1157
01:05:41,546 --> 01:05:43,983
Amy, you're gonna
miss the bus.

1158
01:05:48,118 --> 01:05:50,163
Okay, sweetheart.

1159
01:05:50,207 --> 01:05:53,253
Your teacher is gonna tell me
such wonderful things
about you today.

1160
01:05:53,297 --> 01:05:55,429
Let's celebrate
by baking a cake, okay?

1161
01:05:55,473 --> 01:05:57,127
- Okay.
- Okay, give me a kiss.

1162
01:05:57,170 --> 01:05:59,303
Have a good day.
Here's your lunch.

1163
01:05:59,346 --> 01:06:02,001
- Teacher: Two times one is?
- Kids: Two!

1164
01:06:02,045 --> 01:06:04,264
- Two times two is?
- Four!

1165
01:06:04,308 --> 01:06:07,006
- Two times three is?
- Six!

1166
01:06:07,050 --> 01:06:09,356
- Two times four is?
- Eight!

1167
01:06:09,400 --> 01:06:12,098
- Two times five is?
- 10!

1168
01:06:12,142 --> 01:06:13,752
 Two times six is?

1169
01:06:13,795 --> 01:06:15,710
Her classwork
is excellent.

1170
01:06:17,103 --> 01:06:19,976
- Is her homework okay?
- It's fine.

1171
01:06:20,019 --> 01:06:22,152
Well, something's not fine,
Mrs. Rutherford.

1172
01:06:22,195 --> 01:06:23,327
I can hear it.

1173
01:06:23,370 --> 01:06:26,025
This is very difficult.

1174
01:06:26,069 --> 01:06:29,594
 I think Amy's being 
sexually abused.

1175
01:06:31,204 --> 01:06:35,774
W-why-- why would you
think that?

1176
01:06:35,817 --> 01:06:38,298
Amy's recent behavior.

1177
01:06:38,342 --> 01:06:41,127
Has Amy said anything?

1178
01:06:41,171 --> 01:06:44,261
- No.
- Then where are you
getting this from?

1179
01:06:44,304 --> 01:06:46,176
Mrs. Rutherford,
this is a--

1180
01:06:46,219 --> 01:06:47,655
- this is a hell
of a leap to make.
- I know.

1181
01:06:47,699 --> 01:06:49,657
 And I know this is 
very upsetting.

1182
01:06:49,701 --> 01:06:52,356
But the biggest problem we have
in these situations

1183
01:06:52,399 --> 01:06:55,054
- is the parent's
unwillingness to hear it.
- Wait a minute, wait a minute,

1184
01:06:55,098 --> 01:06:57,274
I am willing
to listen to anything

1185
01:06:57,317 --> 01:06:59,102
that makes sense.

1186
01:06:59,145 --> 01:07:01,321
Amy's recent behavior

1187
01:07:01,365 --> 01:07:04,237
is consistent with a child
who's being abused.

1188
01:07:04,281 --> 01:07:06,065
What behavior?

1189
01:07:07,327 --> 01:07:09,721
Last week at recess,

1190
01:07:09,764 --> 01:07:11,592
she wandered into
the kindergarten room

1191
01:07:11,636 --> 01:07:13,638
and began playing
with some of the dolls.

1192
01:07:13,681 --> 01:07:15,161
Because I was concerned
about her,

1193
01:07:15,205 --> 01:07:16,945
I wanted to observe
the way she played.

1194
01:07:18,121 --> 01:07:20,471
She was
touching the dolls

1195
01:07:20,514 --> 01:07:22,647
on the chest
and between the legs

1196
01:07:22,690 --> 01:07:24,214
 and rubbing them together,

1197
01:07:24,257 --> 01:07:25,824
 whispering things 
I couldn't hear.

1198
01:07:25,867 --> 01:07:27,869
Oh, please.
[ scoffs ]

1199
01:07:29,436 --> 01:07:31,047
Believe me,
Mrs. Ravenson,

1200
01:07:31,090 --> 01:07:33,179
I'm not saying these things
lightly.

1201
01:07:33,223 --> 01:07:36,313
Another day last week,
I walked into class

1202
01:07:36,356 --> 01:07:39,011
and Amy was
in the back of the room
with another little girl.

1203
01:07:39,055 --> 01:07:40,969
She had one hand
on her shoulder

1204
01:07:41,013 --> 01:07:42,971
and she was whispering.

1205
01:07:43,015 --> 01:07:46,018
For goodness' sakes,
whispering? Kids...

1206
01:07:46,062 --> 01:07:48,760
 It's not what she was 
doing or saying.

1207
01:07:48,803 --> 01:07:50,936
It's the way
she was saying it.

1208
01:07:50,979 --> 01:07:53,721

an adult would speak--

 Unfortunately, I've had 
a lot of experience with this

1211
01:08:00,467 --> 01:08:03,079
 and Amy's behavior 
was dead-on.

1212
01:08:08,171 --> 01:08:09,607

That's not my desk.

You're at the wrong desk.

- Mm-hmm.

Sit up here.

01:08:43,902 --> 01:08:46,774

took that money out
of her mommy's purse

1227
01:08:49,212 --> 01:08:50,909
and you were afraid
to tell me?

1228
01:08:50,952 --> 01:08:53,085
And we talked
and I told you

1229
01:08:53,129 --> 01:08:54,869
that there was nothing
in the world

1230
01:08:54,913 --> 01:08:57,307
that you ever, ever

that Mommy always

does she ever have
any of her boyfriends over?

No, she's never had

are out of the house?

Honey, you need
to tell Mommy the truth.

If anything happened,
Mommy knows it's not
your fault.

I went to see
Amy's teacher today.

So?

1269
01:11:03,955 --> 01:11:07,306
So she thinks Amy's
been sexually abused.

That's impossible.

be so sure?

Because she loves you!

Because it broke
her heart to tell me

when my daughter's
telling the truth.

Michael's going to keep Amy
and his practice.

1378
01:17:46,400 --> 01:17:48,185
Never.

Jane: 
"Rikki-Tikki had a right

1380
01:17:50,927 --> 01:17:52,450
 to be proud of himself.

1381
01:17:52,493 --> 01:17:54,408
But he did not grow
too proud

1382
01:17:54,452 --> 01:17:57,629
and he kept that garden
as a mongoose should keep it

and spring and bite

Now will you tell me 
what's been going on?

1387
01:18:23,699 --> 01:18:25,875
Well, when we left
the cottage,

1388
01:18:25,918 --> 01:18:28,616
 I was afraid of Michael, 
so we drove straight to 
the D.A.'s office.

1389
01:18:28,660 --> 01:18:32,055
He listened politely,
but then said he needed
more evidence.

1390
01:18:32,098 --> 01:18:35,711
A seven-year-old child,
it's her word against his.

1391
01:18:35,754 --> 01:18:37,669
So I hired a lawyer

1392
01:18:37,713 --> 01:18:39,758
 and she's 
been tracking down 
Michael's patients.

1393
01:18:39,802 --> 01:18:43,109
And we hit pay dirt
with a Mrs. Klinger.

- She's on her way over.

Oh, I'm so glad
you're here.

- Please come in.
- I can't stay long.

- I can only stay a minute.

Oh, please don't say
what I think you're
gonna say.

I'm sorry,
Mrs. Ravenson.

I know you were counting on us
and I hate to disappoint you--

Then don't, please.

1404
01:19:07,046 --> 01:19:09,875
Mrs. Klinger: 
My husband and I argued 
all last night about it.

1405
01:19:09,919 --> 01:19:12,965
He's adamant.
He won't let Lisa testify.

1406
01:19:16,099 --> 01:19:19,363
My husband
molested your child.

1407

We have no proof.

1408

Do you believe her?

1409
01:19:25,630 --> 01:19:27,458
Yes, I do.

1410
01:19:27,501 --> 01:19:29,677
But who else is gonna believe
a five-year-old?

1411
01:19:29,721 --> 01:19:32,158
My daughter is also
going to testify

1412
01:19:32,202 --> 01:19:34,465
and my attorney is going through
Dr. Ravenson's files

- to see if there's
any other children--
- Lisa has been through so much.

1414

Since she was two,
she's been through
six major operations.

1415
01:19:43,343 --> 01:19:46,825
 We just can't subject her 
to any more.

- Me, too.

lose my daughter.
- Sarah: No.

We won't
let it happen, Jane.

Oh, right, how are you
gonna stop it?

What are you gonna say
under oath about my marriage?

1423
01:20:22,339 --> 01:20:25,559
That Michael was a--
a loving, considerate,
wonderful husband.

1424
01:20:25,603 --> 01:20:27,866
That-- that he was devoted
to me and my child.

1425
01:20:27,910 --> 01:20:30,608
That I must've
told you a million times
how lucky I was to have him.

1426
01:20:30,651 --> 01:20:33,089
Carole will testify
Michael lied to her.

1427
01:20:33,132 --> 01:20:35,047
Oh, did he? Did he?
Or was he just repeating

1428
01:20:35,091 --> 01:20:36,832
the things
his crazy wife told him?

1429
01:20:36,875 --> 01:20:39,530
Sarah, he's got
all the bases covered.

1430
01:20:39,573 --> 01:20:42,228
I was the one
who lost her memory.

1431
01:20:42,272 --> 01:20:44,187
 I was the one 
who tried to kill him.

1432
01:20:44,230 --> 01:20:46,015
I was the one
who locked Paula
in the bathroom

1433
01:20:46,058 --> 01:20:47,886
and broke into
his parents' house.

1434

I don't think they won't be
only too happy to testify.

Even my own doctors
will say

I was suffering from
hysterical amnesia.

1437
01:20:53,936 --> 01:20:55,894
He was
feeding you drugs.

No, no, no,
I stole them
out of his bag.

1439

He only injected me
when I was violent.

don't get Michael,
do you?

He'll do anything
to get what he wants.

1444
01:21:12,345 --> 01:21:14,695
And he could win this.

1445

It's time
for Amy and me
to disappear.

 Do you wanna lose 
all chances of custody?

Michael will find you.

1448

He won't find us.

- What kind of a life is it

if Michael gets custody?

I can't trust
the legal system.

Michael has
all the cards.

I'll go to that meeting

at his lawyer's
office tomorrow
to show good faith.

01:26:10,077 --> 01:26:12,645
We're open to any
reasonable suggestion.

1546
01:26:12,689 --> 01:26:16,214
Well, we're not looking
for any protracted
court battle either.

1547
01:26:16,258 --> 01:26:17,737
As a concerned parent,

1548
01:26:17,781 --> 01:26:19,522
Dr. Ravenson
has no desire

1549
01:26:19,565 --> 01:26:21,872
to see his daughter
separated from her mother

1550
01:26:21,915 --> 01:26:25,223
 at such a critical point 
in her development.

1551
01:26:25,267 --> 01:26:29,184
We're prepared
to give Mrs. Ravenson
full custody of Amy.

1552
01:26:32,187 --> 01:26:34,189
And in return?

1553
01:26:34,232 --> 01:26:37,453
Mrs. Ravenson will drop
all charges of sexual abuse.

1554
01:26:41,065 --> 01:26:43,023
What about visitation?

1555
01:26:43,067 --> 01:26:44,503
Well, naturally,

1556
01:26:44,547 --> 01:26:47,071
Dr. Ravenson
should see his daughter

1557
01:26:47,114 --> 01:26:48,464
on alternate weekends,

1558
01:26:48,507 --> 01:26:49,856
one month in the summer,

1559
01:26:49,900 --> 01:26:52,207
and alternate Easter
and Christmas vacations.

1560
01:26:52,250 --> 01:26:54,165
Unsupervised?

1561
01:26:54,209 --> 01:26:56,036
- Of course.
- We're out of here.

1562
01:26:56,080 --> 01:26:58,125
- Jane.
- Michael: You better 
accept it, Jane.

1563
01:26:58,169 --> 01:27:00,693
If you don't,
I'm gonna fight
for sole custody.

1564
01:27:00,737 --> 01:27:02,086
By the time
we're done with you,

1565
01:27:02,129 --> 01:27:03,479
 you'll never 
see her again.

1566
01:27:05,437 --> 01:27:08,223
What, you really think
the D.A. is gonna take
your word over mine?

1567
01:27:09,963 --> 01:27:12,444
You really think
that a judge is gonna
award custody

1568
01:27:12,488 --> 01:27:14,185
to a woman
with a history like yours?

1569
01:27:14,229 --> 01:27:16,100
 Amnesia, violence.

1570
01:27:17,667 --> 01:27:20,147
You're so blinded
by your hatred of me

1571
01:27:20,191 --> 01:27:22,933
that you can't see the harm
that you're doing to Amy,

1572
01:27:22,976 --> 01:27:25,762
forcing her to testify
against her own father!

1573
01:27:25,805 --> 01:27:27,894
The harm I'mdoing
to Amy?

1574
01:27:27,938 --> 01:27:29,592
- Don't lose your--
- No, wait a minute,
wait a minute.

1575
01:27:29,635 --> 01:27:30,984
Let me get this
straight.

1576
01:27:31,028 --> 01:27:32,464
You get to avoid
all the publicity

1577
01:27:32,508 --> 01:27:34,161
and fallout
of an incest trial,

1578
01:27:34,205 --> 01:27:35,902
you get to
keep your position
at the hospital

1579
01:27:35,946 --> 01:27:37,948
and your
dazzling reputation,

1580
01:27:37,991 --> 01:27:39,819
while on alternate weekends
you get to molest
our little girl?

1581
01:27:39,863 --> 01:27:42,344
[ huffs ]
I don't have to
listen to this.

1582
01:27:42,387 --> 01:27:44,084
Maybe we should
schedule this
for another time.

1583
01:27:44,128 --> 01:27:45,738
There is no time.

1584
01:27:45,782 --> 01:27:48,698
The D.A. is preparing
to bring criminal charges

1585
01:27:48,741 --> 01:27:50,090
against Dr. Ravenson.

1586
01:27:50,134 --> 01:27:53,093
[ both scoffing ]

1587
01:27:53,137 --> 01:27:54,399
What charges?

1588
01:27:54,443 --> 01:27:56,532
Renee, nothing
is gonna stick.

1589
01:27:56,575 --> 01:27:58,708
It's her word
against his.

1590
01:27:58,751 --> 01:28:01,058
Not anymore.

1591
01:28:03,278 --> 01:28:05,845
Do you swear
to tell the truth,
the whole truth,

1592
01:28:05,889 --> 01:28:08,500
and nothing but the truth,
so help you God?

1593
01:28:08,544 --> 01:28:10,067
Yes.

1594
01:28:14,376 --> 01:28:16,203
And the drugs
you were giving her?

1595
01:28:16,247 --> 01:28:18,510
They were prescribed.

1596
01:28:18,554 --> 01:28:20,077
By whom, Dr. Ravenson?

1597
01:28:20,120 --> 01:28:22,688
- Objection.
- Withdrawn.

1598
01:28:22,732 --> 01:28:26,431
Why did you
give Mrs. Ravenson
the medication?

1599
01:28:26,475 --> 01:28:28,564
Because I believed him.

1600
01:28:28,607 --> 01:28:31,044
I did everything
he asked me to do.

1601
01:28:31,088 --> 01:28:33,569
 I kept his wife drugged.

1602
01:28:33,612 --> 01:28:37,181
 I kept her cut off 
from family and friends.

1603
01:28:37,224 --> 01:28:40,358
I watched her suffer.
I just believed

1604
01:28:40,402 --> 01:28:42,882
that he was doing it
for her own good.

1605
01:28:42,926 --> 01:28:44,797
And you no longer
believe that?

1606
01:28:44,841 --> 01:28:47,931
No. He lied to me.

1607
01:28:47,974 --> 01:28:50,150
He molested
my little girl.

1608
01:28:57,680 --> 01:28:59,072
Okay.

1609
01:28:59,116 --> 01:29:01,901
You said Christina
was having nightmares.

1610
01:29:01,945 --> 01:29:03,599
Is that
when you suspected?

1611
01:29:03,642 --> 01:29:05,165
No.

1612
01:29:05,209 --> 01:29:08,212
All that time
I never put it together...

1613
01:29:09,431 --> 01:29:11,520
...till I called one day

1614
01:29:11,563 --> 01:29:14,479
to schedule a checkup
with Dr. Ravenson

1615
01:29:14,523 --> 01:29:17,439
 and she got hysterical.

1616
01:29:17,482 --> 01:29:20,920
 And that's when she told me 
what he did to her

1617
01:29:20,964 --> 01:29:24,663
on his rounds at night
in the hospital.

Renee: 
And did you take Christina 
to another doctor

1621
01:29:36,632 --> 01:29:38,416
 to verify 
what she told you?

1622
01:29:38,460 --> 01:29:41,245
[ sobs ]
Yes, I did.
