(Bell ringing) (Kids cheering)

38
00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:11,367
Have a great summer.

39
00:02:15,349 --> 00:02:16,454
- Can you believe it?

40
00:02:16,455 --> 00:02:18,904
We've got the whole summer
to do whatever we want.

41
00:02:18,905 --> 00:02:20,588
- We're going to
have such a blast.

42
00:02:20,589 --> 00:02:21,462
- I know.

43
00:02:21,463 --> 00:02:23,038
Shopping, staying up late,

44
00:02:23,039 --> 00:02:24,877
going to tons of parties.

45
00:02:24,878 --> 00:02:25,757
- Oh yeah.

46
00:02:25,758 --> 00:02:27,173
- Oh my dad said he
could get us tickets

47
00:02:27,174 --> 00:02:28,702
for lilics June 20th.

48
00:02:28,703 --> 00:02:29,703
- Yes!

49
00:02:30,716 --> 00:02:34,340
- This is going to be
the coolest summer ever.

50
00:02:34,341 --> 00:02:36,106
Jason, where aren't you psyched?

51
00:02:36,107 --> 00:02:37,967
- I'm on lockdown the summer.

52
00:02:37,968 --> 00:02:41,037
My dad's so pizzled 'cause
he got to dizzle this cortizzle.

53
00:02:41,038 --> 00:02:43,318
- Like dude, translate.

54
00:02:43,319 --> 00:02:45,390
I mean, what the heck is
that supposed to mean?

55
00:02:45,391 --> 00:02:47,368
- Yo, you ain't down
with the street lingo?

56
00:02:47,369 --> 00:02:49,919
- Yo, you're not
from the street.

57
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:51,760
I mean your dad's a dentist.

58
00:02:51,761 --> 00:02:53,220
- I totally know what
you mean though.

59
00:02:53,221 --> 00:02:55,966
My mom's still all bent up
over Doug's party last week.

60
00:02:55,967 --> 00:02:57,418
They're like always
on your case.

61
00:02:57,419 --> 00:02:58,688
- I know.

62
00:02:58,689 --> 00:03:00,675
I don't know why don't trust me.

63
00:03:00,676 --> 00:03:03,234
- Oh, are we still gonna
sneak that party at your house?

64
00:03:03,235 --> 00:03:05,925
- Yeah, just keep that quiet.

65
00:03:05,926 --> 00:03:07,121
- Totally.

66
00:03:07,122 --> 00:03:08,322
Can't wait.

67
00:03:08,323 --> 00:03:09,323
Bye Jason.

68
00:03:17,221 --> 00:03:18,473
Hey mom.

69
00:03:18,474 --> 00:03:19,802
Hey dad.

70
00:03:19,803 --> 00:03:21,005
What's up?

71
00:03:21,006 --> 00:03:23,162
- Your daddy bought me
an anniversary present,

72
00:03:23,163 --> 00:03:24,830
and it includes you!

73
00:03:25,995 --> 00:03:27,978
- South Carolina?

74
00:03:27,979 --> 00:03:29,154
- Shut up.

75
00:03:29,155 --> 00:03:31,846
- There goes your chance
to get Jason to like you.

76
00:03:31,847 --> 00:03:33,495
- I don't care.

77
00:03:33,496 --> 00:03:35,564
- The funnest part of
summer is the beginning.

78
00:03:35,565 --> 00:03:38,648
- I don't want to
hear it, all right?

79
00:03:39,673 --> 00:03:40,673
- Honey.

80
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:42,904
That's four suitcases.

81
00:03:42,905 --> 00:03:45,238
- Don't tell me how to pack.

82
00:03:47,921 --> 00:03:49,274
- [Holly] If your
parents wanna get away

83
00:03:49,275 --> 00:03:52,302
why not just go to the
Hamptons or something?

84
00:03:52,303 --> 00:03:54,029
- My grandpa lives down there.

85
00:03:54,030 --> 00:03:55,919
They want me to see
him before he gets so old

86
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:57,844
he doesn't remember me anymore.

87
00:03:57,845 --> 00:04:00,252
He lives in the middle
of freaking nowhere.

88
00:04:00,253 --> 00:04:01,738
- What are you going
to do the whole time?

89
00:04:01,739 --> 00:04:02,617
- I don't know.

90
00:04:02,618 --> 00:04:04,283
I don't know why
they would ever think

91
00:04:04,284 --> 00:04:06,124
that I actually want to go.

92
00:04:06,125 --> 00:04:07,548
- Just ditch, run away.

93
00:04:07,549 --> 00:04:08,694
- Yeah right.

94
00:04:08,695 --> 00:04:10,028
Not enough time.

95
00:04:13,187 --> 00:04:16,620
How much is it for a bus
ticket from Hilton head to here?

96
00:04:16,621 --> 00:04:17,829
- Beats me.

97
00:04:17,830 --> 00:04:19,279
- Holly, you've got
to get your parents

98
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:20,905
to let you come down there.

99
00:04:20,906 --> 00:04:22,945
At least for a
week or something.

100
00:04:22,946 --> 00:04:23,966
- No way.

101
00:04:23,967 --> 00:04:25,214
I'm staying here.

102
00:04:25,215 --> 00:04:26,615
- [Father] Annie.

103
00:04:26,616 --> 00:04:27,616
Get packed.

104
00:04:28,578 --> 00:04:29,846
- Better go.

105
00:04:29,847 --> 00:04:32,176
It's off to the
island of boring.

106
00:04:32,177 --> 00:04:33,177
- Bye.

107
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:40,027
(Slow music)

108
00:04:41,177 --> 00:04:42,969
- [Mother] Annie,
are you packing?

109
00:04:42,970 --> 00:04:44,672
- [Annie] I'm working on it.

110
00:04:44,673 --> 00:04:45,575
- [Mother] Honey,
our flight leaves

111
00:04:45,576 --> 00:04:47,825
first thing in the morning.

112
00:04:59,994 --> 00:05:01,053
- [Pilot] Ladies and gentlemen.

113
00:05:01,054 --> 00:05:02,413
Welcome to Hilton head island.

114
00:05:02,414 --> 00:05:03,552
Have a wonderful vacation,

115
00:05:03,553 --> 00:05:06,303
and thank you
for flying with us.

116
00:05:14,151 --> 00:05:16,282
- [Father] Carol, you've
called him five times.

117
00:05:16,283 --> 00:05:17,235
Will you relax?

118
00:05:17,236 --> 00:05:18,289
- [Mother] I am relaxed.

119
00:05:18,290 --> 00:05:19,632
He's not picking up.

120
00:05:19,633 --> 00:05:22,424
I just hope he remembers
we're coming today.

121
00:05:22,425 --> 00:05:24,337
- [Father] Hey Annie, your
grandpa's got a really nice house

122
00:05:24,338 --> 00:05:25,304
right by the beach,

123
00:05:25,305 --> 00:05:26,971
and he's got a pool.

124
00:05:28,462 --> 00:05:32,212
- [Annie] Beautiful
house right by the beach.

125
00:05:35,516 --> 00:05:36,683
- [Carol] Dad?

126
00:05:38,747 --> 00:05:40,882
- It smells in here.

127
00:05:40,883 --> 00:05:41,883
- Annie.

128
00:05:42,766 --> 00:05:43,933
Dad, you here?

129
00:05:45,304 --> 00:05:46,721
- Hey everybody.

130
00:05:47,591 --> 00:05:49,073
- Thank goodness you're here.

131
00:05:49,074 --> 00:05:50,652
You remembered we were coming?

132
00:05:50,653 --> 00:05:51,692
- Yeah, after the fifth call

133
00:05:51,693 --> 00:05:53,910
I was pretty sure
today was the day.

134
00:05:53,911 --> 00:05:55,260
(Sneezing)

135
00:05:55,261 --> 00:05:56,261
- Bless you.

136
00:05:57,513 --> 00:05:59,128
- [Father] Grandpa
Don, you look great.

137
00:05:59,129 --> 00:06:00,521
- [Grandpa] Well
you look the same.

138
00:06:00,522 --> 00:06:01,816
- Thanks.
- Still peddling insurance?

139
00:06:01,817 --> 00:06:02,962
- Advertising.

140
00:06:02,963 --> 00:06:04,509
- Just kidding.

141
00:06:04,510 --> 00:06:06,199
You know, the
last time I saw you

142
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:08,244
you were missing
two front teeth.

143
00:06:08,245 --> 00:06:10,145
But you've gotten so pretty now.

144
00:06:10,146 --> 00:06:11,729
Like a young woman.

145
00:06:15,162 --> 00:06:17,780
Well, got you all set up, kid.

146
00:06:17,781 --> 00:06:19,437
Your own room
right next to mine.

147
00:06:19,438 --> 00:06:22,719
Your own little kingdom,
or queendom I should say.

148
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,053
- Great.
- Great.

149
00:06:25,005 --> 00:06:25,880
- Offer still stands.

150
00:06:25,881 --> 00:06:27,849
I can fix up the other
room for you two.

151
00:06:27,850 --> 00:06:30,017
- We already got a condo.

152
00:06:31,490 --> 00:06:34,341
- I'm staying here by myself?

153
00:06:34,342 --> 00:06:37,085
- We thought it would give you
and grandpa a chance to bond.

154
00:06:37,086 --> 00:06:39,368
- We'll all be
together, sort of.

155
00:06:39,369 --> 00:06:40,790
- I can sleep on your couch.

156
00:06:40,791 --> 00:06:42,570
You won't even know I'm there.

157
00:06:42,571 --> 00:06:45,634
- Annie, your mom and I
need some time together.

158
00:06:45,635 --> 00:06:48,107
I'll make it up to
you, I promise.

159
00:06:48,108 --> 00:06:49,941
- You always say that.

160
00:06:51,422 --> 00:06:52,648
- Do you think they'll
be okay together alone?

161
00:06:52,649 --> 00:06:53,522
- Yeah, they're gonna be fine.

162
00:06:53,522 --> 00:06:54,478
Listen...
- I don't think

163
00:06:54,478 --> 00:06:55,357
this is such a good idea.

164
00:06:55,358 --> 00:06:57,007
- [Father] Everybody's
going to have a great time.

165
00:06:57,008 --> 00:06:59,881
- We'll check back with
you around dinner time.

166
00:06:59,882 --> 00:07:01,295
- No problemo.

167
00:07:01,296 --> 00:07:03,608
- Annie, you help
your grandpa, okay?

168
00:07:03,609 --> 00:07:05,437
And stay close to
the house please.

169
00:07:05,438 --> 00:07:06,833
You have my cell phone number.

170
00:07:06,834 --> 00:07:09,584
And the number
to the condo is...

171
00:07:10,822 --> 00:07:13,405
(Gentle music)

172
00:07:22,938 --> 00:07:23,938
- Nice pool.

173
00:07:41,491 --> 00:07:45,704
- Oh, did you notice we
have two turtles in the pool?

174
00:07:45,705 --> 00:07:48,288
I named them George and Gracie.

175
00:07:49,224 --> 00:07:51,927
So, you want the grand tour?

176
00:07:51,928 --> 00:07:52,928
- No thanks.

177
00:07:54,541 --> 00:07:56,028
- [Grandpa] Want a cold drink?

178
00:07:56,029 --> 00:07:57,457
- Do you have lemonade?

179
00:07:57,458 --> 00:07:58,958
- I have iced tea.

180
00:07:59,907 --> 00:08:01,927
- I don't like iced tea.

181
00:08:01,928 --> 00:08:04,783
- I'll have to remember that.

182
00:08:04,784 --> 00:08:06,429
Too bad I don't have lemonade.

183
00:08:06,430 --> 00:08:09,361
I could have made
you an Arnold Palmer.

184
00:08:09,362 --> 00:08:11,112
That's a famous golf,

185
00:08:12,024 --> 00:08:13,024
well anyway.

186
00:08:37,273 --> 00:08:39,709
So how was your flight?

187
00:08:39,710 --> 00:08:40,710
- Fine.

188
00:08:43,971 --> 00:08:47,864
- I don't mind flying,
but Dee, your grandma,

189
00:08:47,865 --> 00:08:50,204
she used to hate it.

190
00:08:50,205 --> 00:08:53,872
She had a whole crazy
ritual and everything.

191
00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:01,163
How's school?

192
00:09:01,164 --> 00:09:02,332
- It's summer.

193
00:09:02,333 --> 00:09:03,430
School's over.

194
00:09:03,431 --> 00:09:05,017
- Right.

195
00:09:05,018 --> 00:09:07,212
Well, did you have a good year?

196
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:08,713
How did it end up?

197
00:09:09,826 --> 00:09:10,826
- Fine.

198
00:09:12,498 --> 00:09:15,248
- What about the
musical theater?

199
00:09:16,781 --> 00:09:19,448
I mean did you do any new plays?

200
00:09:20,647 --> 00:09:22,422
- We did grease.

201
00:09:22,423 --> 00:09:23,423
- Grease.

202
00:09:25,117 --> 00:09:26,617
That sounds messy.

203
00:09:32,787 --> 00:09:34,595
This place is such a dump.

204
00:09:34,596 --> 00:09:37,207
There's crud everywhere.

205
00:09:37,208 --> 00:09:38,344
His pool is all dirty.

206
00:09:38,345 --> 00:09:40,270
And there are sea
creatures there's living in it.

207
00:09:40,271 --> 00:09:41,455
It's so humid.

208
00:09:41,456 --> 00:09:42,775
It's sticky.

209
00:09:42,776 --> 00:09:45,193
And everything smells so bad.

210
00:09:46,644 --> 00:09:49,970
This place needs
some fun and Lysol.

211
00:09:49,971 --> 00:09:52,583
- Ooh, what's it smell like?

212
00:09:52,584 --> 00:09:54,183
- Every room is different.

213
00:09:54,184 --> 00:09:57,143
I mean, the living room
smells like the back of a cab.

214
00:09:57,144 --> 00:10:00,199
This room smells
like an old tire.

215
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:01,266
- You're going to be down there

216
00:10:01,267 --> 00:10:03,517
for half of the summer?

217
00:10:03,518 --> 00:10:05,233
You're never going to make it.

218
00:10:05,234 --> 00:10:06,234
- I know.

219
00:10:07,077 --> 00:10:09,554
You know what, could
you do me a favor?

220
00:10:09,555 --> 00:10:12,746
Go online to find out
the bus schedules, okay?

221
00:10:12,747 --> 00:10:14,414
I'll call you later.

222
00:10:17,032 --> 00:10:19,865
(Whimsical music)

223
00:10:32,311 --> 00:10:34,650
(Metal creaking)

224
00:10:34,651 --> 00:10:35,915
- Howdy Dutch.

225
00:10:35,916 --> 00:10:38,036
- You ever going to get things
fixed proper around here?

226
00:10:38,037 --> 00:10:39,059
- Where have you been?

227
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:40,060
You missed lunch.

228
00:10:40,061 --> 00:10:43,113
Annie, say hello to
my buddy Barney.

229
00:10:43,114 --> 00:10:44,113
You're going to like her.

230
00:10:44,114 --> 00:10:45,157
She's a peach.

231
00:10:45,158 --> 00:10:47,491
- [Barney] Oh, I love fruit.

232
00:10:48,965 --> 00:10:49,965
- Hi.
- Hi.

233
00:10:52,169 --> 00:10:53,169
I...

234
00:10:55,742 --> 00:10:57,437
- She's a little shy.

235
00:10:57,438 --> 00:10:58,438
- Sassy too.

236
00:10:59,439 --> 00:11:00,713
- Well she's 12.

237
00:11:00,714 --> 00:11:02,371
It's an independent age.

238
00:11:02,372 --> 00:11:04,205
- The boy chasing age.

239
00:11:05,168 --> 00:11:06,900
Reminds me of when Sally Evans

240
00:11:06,901 --> 00:11:10,537
tried to smooch me in the
pumpkin patch at the state fair.

241
00:11:10,538 --> 00:11:13,552
- I've heard that
story five times.

242
00:11:13,553 --> 00:11:16,292
- So you got her stuck
over in that janitor's closet

243
00:11:16,293 --> 00:11:18,964
you call a guestroom, huh?

244
00:11:18,965 --> 00:11:21,076
- At least I've got
guests in my guest room.

245
00:11:21,077 --> 00:11:23,342
- What do you plan
on doing with her?

246
00:11:23,343 --> 00:11:26,243
I mean, sociality is not
exactly your strong point.

247
00:11:26,244 --> 00:11:28,715
- We're going to
have a lot of fun.

248
00:11:28,716 --> 00:11:30,883
There's cards and puzzles.

249
00:11:31,909 --> 00:11:33,904
Go for walks on the trails.

250
00:11:33,905 --> 00:11:35,535
- Take her fishing.

251
00:11:35,536 --> 00:11:37,573
When my granddaughter
Ashley comes

252
00:11:37,574 --> 00:11:40,100
she gets such a thrill out
of that whenever she's here.

253
00:11:40,101 --> 00:11:42,708
- Ah the old skiff is
not sea worthy now.

254
00:11:42,709 --> 00:11:44,489
Motor conks out.

255
00:11:44,490 --> 00:11:46,943
- Well then you get it fixed.

256
00:11:46,944 --> 00:11:49,103
- Why don't you just
stop talking to me?

257
00:11:49,104 --> 00:11:50,240
- [Barney] You
invited me over here.

258
00:11:50,241 --> 00:11:51,354
- [Grandpa] No I didn't.

259
00:11:51,355 --> 00:11:52,423
You just showed up.

260
00:11:52,424 --> 00:11:53,688
- [Barney] Well I
didn't just show.

261
00:11:53,689 --> 00:11:54,693
You know, you invited me.

262
00:11:54,694 --> 00:11:57,656
I have other
people that I can...

263
00:11:57,657 --> 00:11:58,657
- [Grandpa] I'll bet you do.

264
00:11:58,658 --> 00:12:00,684
- [Barney] You think you're
the only fish in the sea?

265
00:12:00,685 --> 00:12:02,076
There are plenty of
people that enjoy me.

266
00:12:02,077 --> 00:12:04,519
- [Grandpa] All right, all
right, did you bring the cards?

267
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:07,687
(Indistinct chatter)

268
00:12:14,818 --> 00:12:16,102
- Well, we better get going.

269
00:12:16,103 --> 00:12:17,654
Big day tomorrow.

270
00:12:17,655 --> 00:12:18,711
We're going to go
up to Charleston

271
00:12:18,712 --> 00:12:19,815
and check out some properties

272
00:12:19,816 --> 00:12:21,255
and visit fort Sumter.

273
00:12:21,256 --> 00:12:23,148
- Guess I'm not invited?

274
00:12:23,149 --> 00:12:26,166
- We'll do whatever you
want when we get back.

275
00:12:26,167 --> 00:12:28,967
- Like fly back to New York?

276
00:12:28,968 --> 00:12:30,960
- Annie and I have
some plans of our own.

277
00:12:30,961 --> 00:12:34,128
I thought I'd teach
her to play chess.

278
00:12:35,110 --> 00:12:37,360
- Better get my sleep then.

279
00:12:39,736 --> 00:12:41,069
I need some air.

280
00:12:43,736 --> 00:12:45,249
- All of a sudden there I am

281
00:12:45,250 --> 00:12:48,083
face to face with
this huge snake.

282
00:12:49,204 --> 00:12:51,436
I mean he was seven
feet if he was an inch.

283
00:12:51,437 --> 00:12:53,457
Now I didn't know
it was poisonous.

284
00:12:53,458 --> 00:12:55,061
I didn't care.

285
00:12:55,062 --> 00:12:57,303
I reached for my
trusty, Jim bowie knife

286
00:12:57,304 --> 00:12:59,239
and shoo shoo shoo,

287
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:01,505
instant snakeskin boots.

288
00:13:01,506 --> 00:13:02,504
- Mom never went back to

289
00:13:02,505 --> 00:13:04,455
dangerous fusky
with you after that.

290
00:13:04,456 --> 00:13:05,905
- That's a great story.

291
00:13:05,906 --> 00:13:07,351
Hey Annie, you're missing these.

292
00:13:07,352 --> 00:13:08,910
Your grandpa's full of them.

293
00:13:08,911 --> 00:13:10,612
- I'm sure he's
full of something.

294
00:13:10,613 --> 00:13:12,029
- What's that?

295
00:13:12,030 --> 00:13:13,956
- I said I haven't seen
any wild animals yet.

296
00:13:13,957 --> 00:13:16,393
We've been inside all day.

297
00:13:16,394 --> 00:13:17,961
- You two better stick together.

298
00:13:17,962 --> 00:13:19,620
Especially at night.

299
00:13:19,621 --> 00:13:21,028
- Afraid a snake will eat me?

300
00:13:21,029 --> 00:13:23,112
- Maybe, or captain Jack.

301
00:13:25,042 --> 00:13:26,548
- Who's that?

302
00:13:26,549 --> 00:13:27,980
- Captain Jack stoney,

303
00:13:27,981 --> 00:13:31,209
a patriot rebel from
the revolutionary war.

304
00:13:31,210 --> 00:13:32,868
That's his house
there that he built.

305
00:13:32,869 --> 00:13:34,110
After he died

306
00:13:34,111 --> 00:13:36,977
one of his grandkids saw Jack,

307
00:13:36,978 --> 00:13:39,905
lost it in an all
night poker game.

308
00:13:39,906 --> 00:13:42,170
Captain Jack was so furious
that he came back from the dead

309
00:13:42,171 --> 00:13:45,082
to haunt this house and
all the woods around it.

310
00:13:45,083 --> 00:13:47,666
So all these woods are haunted.

311
00:13:49,253 --> 00:13:51,738
- Guess I'll need my
trusty David bowie knife.

312
00:13:51,739 --> 00:13:52,736
- Annie.

313
00:13:52,737 --> 00:13:54,320
- It's fine.

314
00:13:54,321 --> 00:13:55,869
So the dock is over here,

315
00:13:55,870 --> 00:13:58,682
and I thought one day maybe
I'd take Annie out on the water

316
00:13:58,683 --> 00:14:00,128
for a little fishing.

317
00:14:00,129 --> 00:14:01,269
- You have a boat?

318
00:14:01,270 --> 00:14:02,267
- Yeah.

319
00:14:02,267 --> 00:14:03,267
- No boat.

320
00:14:05,204 --> 00:14:06,267
- It's a pull start, Annie,

321
00:14:06,268 --> 00:14:08,185
just like a lawn mower.

322
00:14:09,499 --> 00:14:12,319
Well that's old ironsides.

323
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:13,530
- You ever take him out?

324
00:14:13,531 --> 00:14:15,967
- Ah, not for a while.

325
00:14:15,968 --> 00:14:19,205
Mostly just sits there
collecting barnacles.

326
00:14:19,206 --> 00:14:20,586
You see this island,

327
00:14:20,587 --> 00:14:22,504
right around the bend over here,

328
00:14:22,505 --> 00:14:24,548
and across the
calliboggie sound,

329
00:14:24,549 --> 00:14:27,914
you can see the bridge
that took you in here.

330
00:14:27,915 --> 00:14:29,210
- Can we go for a ride?

331
00:14:29,211 --> 00:14:30,802
- No Annie.

332
00:14:30,803 --> 00:14:33,685
Daddy, you haven't
used that clunker in years.

333
00:14:33,686 --> 00:14:36,295
- Well, I thought we'd
just dip our Poles in,

334
00:14:36,296 --> 00:14:37,719
you know, nothing fancy.

335
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:39,012
- Well it's easy to lose
your balance on that thing.

336
00:14:39,013 --> 00:14:42,444
Trust me, I fell overboard
plenty when I was growing up.

337
00:14:42,445 --> 00:14:45,911
- That's right, you never
really learned to swim.

338
00:14:45,912 --> 00:14:48,495
- I never really had a teacher.

339
00:14:50,810 --> 00:14:54,076
And your granddaughter
is no Mark Spitz either.

340
00:14:54,077 --> 00:14:55,074
Annie, listen to me.

341
00:14:55,075 --> 00:14:57,409
I do not want you on that boat.

342
00:14:57,410 --> 00:15:00,635
Promise me you won't go on it.

343
00:15:00,636 --> 00:15:01,750
Promise me.

344
00:15:01,751 --> 00:15:03,391
- I heard you already.

345
00:15:03,392 --> 00:15:04,714
You think I'm stupid?

346
00:15:04,715 --> 00:15:06,629
Just leave me alone.

347
00:15:06,630 --> 00:15:07,630
- Honey...

348
00:15:13,611 --> 00:15:16,778
- You guys are gonna
have so much fun.

349
00:15:18,079 --> 00:15:20,662
(Gentle music)

350
00:15:24,966 --> 00:15:27,450
(Static buzzing)

351
00:15:27,451 --> 00:15:30,618
(Speaking in Spanish)

352
00:15:33,835 --> 00:15:36,585
(Static buzzing)

353
00:15:39,171 --> 00:15:42,570
(Soft snoring)

354
00:15:42,571 --> 00:15:45,904
(Gentle cheerful music)

355
00:16:51,122 --> 00:16:53,622
(Dog barking)

356
00:16:58,157 --> 00:17:00,202
- [Annie] Come here, doggie.

357
00:17:00,203 --> 00:17:01,453
Where'd you go?

358
00:17:13,043 --> 00:17:14,293
Come here, boy.

359
00:17:15,264 --> 00:17:16,431
Where are you?

360
00:17:17,727 --> 00:17:19,227
Come here, doggie.

361
00:17:21,476 --> 00:17:22,726
Where'd you go?

362
00:17:23,738 --> 00:17:26,321
(Spooky music)

363
00:17:47,292 --> 00:17:50,375
(Intensifying music)

364
00:18:22,195 --> 00:18:24,362
(Gasping)

365
00:18:26,513 --> 00:18:27,974
It's you!

366
00:18:27,975 --> 00:18:29,840
You're captain Jack!

367
00:18:29,841 --> 00:18:31,574
(Man mumbling)

368
00:18:31,575 --> 00:18:32,954
Get away from me!

369
00:18:32,955 --> 00:18:37,955
(Man mumbling) (Annie screaming)

370
00:18:38,305 --> 00:18:39,305
Help, help!

371
00:18:42,417 --> 00:18:43,667
Please help me!

372
00:18:46,097 --> 00:18:47,664
I just saw captain Jack!

373
00:18:47,665 --> 00:18:49,034
He tried to attack me!

374
00:18:49,035 --> 00:18:51,296
He's still out there!

375
00:18:51,297 --> 00:18:53,547
(Laughing)

376
00:19:00,201 --> 00:19:02,451
(Giggling)

377
00:19:06,577 --> 00:19:09,478
So your grandpa's Barney?

378
00:19:09,479 --> 00:19:11,330
I kinda met him.

379
00:19:11,331 --> 00:19:13,183
- Skinny guy, old,

380
00:19:13,184 --> 00:19:14,319
kind of banged up.

381
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:15,746
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

382
00:19:15,747 --> 00:19:17,302
- I pass through here
every now and then.

383
00:19:17,303 --> 00:19:19,263
I'm a musician on my way to L.A.

384
00:19:19,264 --> 00:19:20,759
I'm going to meet
with this producer

385
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:22,255
who did Ashanti's first disc.

386
00:19:22,256 --> 00:19:23,556
I'm getting ready
to lay down tracks

387
00:19:23,557 --> 00:19:24,964
for my debut album next week.

388
00:19:24,965 --> 00:19:26,264
- That's so cool.

389
00:19:26,265 --> 00:19:27,354
Gonna be famous.

390
00:19:27,355 --> 00:19:28,436
- Yeah.

391
00:19:28,437 --> 00:19:30,309
So what kind of
music you listen to?

392
00:19:30,310 --> 00:19:31,547
- Everything.

393
00:19:31,548 --> 00:19:34,048
Lilics, gbe, men and marbles.

394
00:19:35,737 --> 00:19:37,409
- Yeah, I'm a hip
hop girl myself.

395
00:19:37,410 --> 00:19:39,468
That's the kind of music
that's going on my album.

396
00:19:39,469 --> 00:19:40,881
- That's cool.

397
00:19:40,882 --> 00:19:43,739
People here probably haven't
even heard of it yet though.

398
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:45,132
- You got that right.

399
00:19:45,133 --> 00:19:46,671
Wilton head.

400
00:19:46,672 --> 00:19:48,075
You're a pretty cool chick.

401
00:19:48,076 --> 00:19:49,157
- Thanks.

402
00:19:49,158 --> 00:19:50,606
- Do you want one?

403
00:19:50,607 --> 00:19:51,940
- Um, no I quit.

404
00:19:54,928 --> 00:19:56,154
- Right.

405
00:19:56,155 --> 00:19:57,706
Well, here we are.

406
00:19:57,707 --> 00:19:58,820
If you see captain Jack again

407
00:19:58,821 --> 00:20:00,270
just turn and run the other way.

408
00:20:00,271 --> 00:20:02,078
- Right - I'll see you around.

409
00:20:02,079 --> 00:20:03,079
- Thanks.

410
00:20:06,216 --> 00:20:10,263
If you want to hang
out again sometime.

411
00:20:10,264 --> 00:20:12,681
(Slow music)

412
00:20:24,401 --> 00:20:26,272
(Bird squawking)

413
00:20:26,273 --> 00:20:27,755
What the heck was that?

414
00:20:27,756 --> 00:20:30,423
(Bird chirping)

415
00:20:36,994 --> 00:20:40,077
(Banging on window)

416
00:20:46,508 --> 00:20:47,508
Stupid bird.

417
00:20:48,540 --> 00:20:50,373
Go away, I'm sleeping.

418
00:20:51,662 --> 00:20:52,662
Go away.

419
00:20:55,259 --> 00:20:58,092
(Window slamming)

420
00:21:01,296 --> 00:21:02,255
(Annie screaming)

421
00:21:02,256 --> 00:21:03,265
- Oh!

422
00:21:03,266 --> 00:21:04,510
(Annie screaming)
- Oh!

423
00:21:04,511 --> 00:21:05,624
- Can't you see I'm in here?

424
00:21:05,625 --> 00:21:06,867
What are you doing, get out!

425
00:21:06,868 --> 00:21:10,201
- I didn't know you were...
- Get out, go!

426
00:21:14,106 --> 00:21:15,356
Close the door!

427
00:21:18,999 --> 00:21:20,142
(Annie screaming)
- Oh!

428
00:21:20,143 --> 00:21:21,920
(Annie screaming) Oh!

429
00:21:21,921 --> 00:21:22,879
I'm sorry.

430
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:24,408
I'm just going to
close the door.

431
00:21:24,409 --> 00:21:25,242
- Just go!

432
00:21:25,243 --> 00:21:26,419
- I'm going.

433
00:21:26,420 --> 00:21:29,087
(Door slamming)

434
00:21:34,376 --> 00:21:35,885
- What's that?

435
00:21:35,886 --> 00:21:38,136
- Grits, they're delicious.

436
00:21:44,314 --> 00:21:45,314
Good, huh?

437
00:21:48,173 --> 00:21:50,673
- It tastes like a wet napkin.

438
00:21:52,995 --> 00:21:55,578
- Try a little butter and salt.

439
00:21:56,580 --> 00:21:57,913
- I'm on a diet.

440
00:22:02,409 --> 00:22:04,826
- I'll have to remember that.

441
00:22:06,422 --> 00:22:08,027
Well, it's going
to be a hot day.

442
00:22:08,028 --> 00:22:11,116
Maybe we can head for the beach.

443
00:22:11,117 --> 00:22:12,823
- How far do we have to walk?

444
00:22:12,824 --> 00:22:13,824
- Walk?

445
00:22:14,493 --> 00:22:16,243
We'll take the eagle.

446
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:19,768
(Jazzy music)

447
00:22:19,769 --> 00:22:21,573
I haven't stretched
her legs in a while.

448
00:22:21,574 --> 00:22:25,027
I only take her out
on special occasions.

449
00:22:25,028 --> 00:22:27,414
And the tags are overdue
by a couple of years,

450
00:22:27,415 --> 00:22:28,415
but, hop in!

451
00:22:38,748 --> 00:22:40,072
(Engine humming) See that?

452
00:22:40,073 --> 00:22:42,211
Runs like a panther.

453
00:22:42,212 --> 00:22:45,212
(Engine sputtering)

454
00:22:50,723 --> 00:22:51,723
- Perfect.

455
00:22:53,191 --> 00:22:56,770
- How bad do you
want to go to the beach?

456
00:22:56,771 --> 00:22:59,591
And the cockamamie agent
wants to make me pay a co pay

457
00:22:59,592 --> 00:23:01,004
for generics.

458
00:23:01,005 --> 00:23:02,640
It's absurd.

459
00:23:02,641 --> 00:23:04,082
Gonna put me in the poor house.

460
00:23:04,083 --> 00:23:06,860
It's not like I'm taking, you
know, some Cosmopolitan

461
00:23:06,861 --> 00:23:08,562
she she designer drugs.

462
00:23:08,563 --> 00:23:11,175
I've been a diabetic
for 20 dang years.

463
00:23:11,176 --> 00:23:13,079
But these crooks,
they just come in and...

464
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:14,084
- Hey, hey.
- What?

465
00:23:14,085 --> 00:23:15,330
- Don't curse in front of Annie.

466
00:23:15,331 --> 00:23:17,138
- What'd I say?

467
00:23:17,139 --> 00:23:18,546
Crooks?

468
00:23:18,547 --> 00:23:20,438
- The d word.

469
00:23:20,439 --> 00:23:21,439
- Drugs?

470
00:23:22,770 --> 00:23:26,044
Any rate, the pharmacist
is an attractive gal.

471
00:23:26,045 --> 00:23:27,291
I will say that.

472
00:23:27,292 --> 00:23:30,375
But boy, what a...
- [Grandpa] Barney?

473
00:23:37,907 --> 00:23:39,157
- Unbelievable.

474
00:23:58,496 --> 00:24:03,082
- So what do you think a 12
year old even does nowadays?

475
00:24:03,083 --> 00:24:04,767
I mean, it's the 21st century.

476
00:24:04,768 --> 00:24:06,185
So 12 would be 17

477
00:24:07,403 --> 00:24:09,126
compared to when we were 12,

478
00:24:09,127 --> 00:24:10,949
and she's from the city.

479
00:24:10,950 --> 00:24:14,367
So 17 would be about
25 in country years.

480
00:24:16,557 --> 00:24:19,678
So it's like having a 25
year old stay with you.

481
00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:23,788
I have no idea of what a
25 year old does these days.

482
00:24:23,789 --> 00:24:26,232
And I know you
haven't the foggiest.

483
00:24:26,233 --> 00:24:29,383
- The Savannah theater might
have a production going on.

484
00:24:29,384 --> 00:24:31,694
That might be fun for her.

485
00:24:31,695 --> 00:24:32,692
- No, no, no.

486
00:24:32,693 --> 00:24:35,312
Small town theater
for a big city girl?

487
00:24:35,313 --> 00:24:37,055
No, no way.

488
00:24:37,056 --> 00:24:39,848
Although that does remind
me of this small town theater

489
00:24:39,849 --> 00:24:40,903
actress that I met.

490
00:24:40,904 --> 00:24:43,404
Did I...
- Shh, here she comes.

491
00:24:44,333 --> 00:24:47,406
- So Kennedy comes on board.

492
00:24:47,407 --> 00:24:49,686
And he turns to me and he says,

493
00:24:49,687 --> 00:24:51,404
"officer, I need a guide,"

494
00:24:51,405 --> 00:24:52,460
and there I was,

495
00:24:52,461 --> 00:24:54,225
showing the future
president around.

496
00:24:54,226 --> 00:24:55,223
- [Barney] Now wait a minute.

497
00:24:55,224 --> 00:24:57,240
Was this before or
after you single handedly

498
00:24:57,241 --> 00:24:58,241
foiled the bank robbery?

499
00:24:58,242 --> 00:24:59,836
- Oh, no way before.

500
00:24:59,837 --> 00:25:01,318
The bank robbery was in '78.

501
00:25:01,319 --> 00:25:02,639
- Right, right.

502
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:05,390
(Cheerful music)

503
00:25:10,443 --> 00:25:12,879
Alrighty, I'm off to see
those d word crooks.

504
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:14,741
Meet you back here.

505
00:25:14,742 --> 00:25:16,075
- Okay, bye bye.

506
00:25:16,926 --> 00:25:18,778
Care for a trip to
the gas station?

507
00:25:18,779 --> 00:25:21,728
I need some go go
juice for the eagle.

508
00:25:21,729 --> 00:25:22,817
- No thanks.

509
00:25:22,818 --> 00:25:24,342
I think I'll just window shop.

510
00:25:24,343 --> 00:25:25,426
- Okay, here.

511
00:25:26,711 --> 00:25:28,711
Get yourself a soda pop.

512
00:25:29,996 --> 00:25:31,975
(Audience applauding)

513
00:25:31,976 --> 00:25:33,419
- [Man] Hello harbour town.

514
00:25:33,420 --> 00:25:34,920
Wow, what a crowd.

515
00:25:36,445 --> 00:25:37,778
You're too kind.

516
00:25:40,094 --> 00:25:41,723
Thanks everyone
for coming out today.

517
00:25:41,724 --> 00:25:42,827
You'll recognize this.

518
00:25:42,828 --> 00:25:44,403
It's one of my greatest hits.

519
00:25:44,404 --> 00:25:47,404
This one goes
out to all the ladies.

520
00:25:51,612 --> 00:25:54,539
♪ Your name and mine ♪

521
00:25:54,540 --> 00:25:58,694

524
00:26:06,065 --> 00:26:07,065
- Hey honey.

525
00:26:08,754 --> 00:26:10,135
I see you've met Lance,

526
00:26:10,136 --> 00:26:12,423
one of our local talents.

527
00:26:12,424 --> 00:26:13,991
- Talents?

528
00:26:13,992 --> 00:26:16,462
He sounds like a dying whale.

529
00:26:16,463 --> 00:26:19,349
- [Grandpa] Well he's no
Perry Como, I'll give you that.

530
00:26:19,350 --> 00:26:21,967
He still needs to practice.

531
00:26:21,968 --> 00:26:23,316
- For what?

532
00:26:23,317 --> 00:26:25,407
- Well for the
midsummer festival.

533
00:26:25,408 --> 00:26:27,204
It's a community thing.

534
00:26:27,205 --> 00:26:28,639
Anybody with a voice
and a lot of nerve

535
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:30,271
can strut their stuff.

536
00:26:30,272 --> 00:26:31,269
A few years back

537
00:26:31,270 --> 00:26:32,793
we had a guy who
used to play a guitar

538
00:26:32,794 --> 00:26:35,737
and sing here to a packed crowd.

539
00:26:35,738 --> 00:26:37,951
Thousands of people every night.

540
00:26:37,952 --> 00:26:39,450
Spectacular.

541
00:26:39,451 --> 00:26:40,451
Now...

542
00:26:47,147 --> 00:26:48,897
- This is disgusting!

543
00:26:52,175 --> 00:26:53,310
- [Annie] So what happened?

544
00:26:53,311 --> 00:26:54,451
- I don't know.

545
00:26:54,452 --> 00:26:57,369
One day I guess
he just gave it up.

546
00:26:58,414 --> 00:27:00,831
- Maybe captain Jack ate him.

547
00:27:05,657 --> 00:27:07,709
- Hey guys, hey.

548
00:27:07,710 --> 00:27:08,941
Train's leaving.

549
00:27:08,942 --> 00:27:10,344
You may have to help me drive.

550
00:27:10,345 --> 00:27:12,262
I've been robbed blind.

551
00:27:13,848 --> 00:27:17,719
Oh that's a nice purse
you got there, captain.

552
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:19,021
- [Announcer]
Last of the seventh.

553
00:27:19,022 --> 00:27:21,772
Two outs, man
on first and third.

554
00:27:22,823 --> 00:27:25,852
Trying to get back in this game.

555
00:27:25,853 --> 00:27:29,510
There's a good chance
for them to get back in.

556
00:27:29,511 --> 00:27:32,213
- You can't talk to
ballplayers anymore.

557
00:27:32,214 --> 00:27:35,255
I remember this one time
I was at Yankee stadium.

558
00:27:35,256 --> 00:27:37,041
Mickey mantle came up to bat,

559
00:27:37,042 --> 00:27:39,297
and I shouted to
him from the stands.

560
00:27:39,298 --> 00:27:41,905
I said, "hey Mick,
tuck your elbow in."

561
00:27:41,906 --> 00:27:44,903
He turned and he nodded to me.

562
00:27:44,904 --> 00:27:47,982
And the first pitch out,
bam, right over the fence.

563
00:27:47,983 --> 00:27:52,733
And I swear he tipped his
cap to me as he rounded third.

564
00:27:54,045 --> 00:27:55,502
Remember another time

565
00:27:55,503 --> 00:27:57,861
I was doing a security
detail with Elvis,

566
00:27:57,862 --> 00:28:00,136
and we were backstage
at some big arena.

567
00:28:00,137 --> 00:28:01,470
- Ah, that's it!

568
00:28:02,345 --> 00:28:04,526
I can't take it anymore!

569
00:28:04,527 --> 00:28:05,718
- What?

570
00:28:05,719 --> 00:28:07,150
- All your lies.

571
00:28:07,151 --> 00:28:08,427
Killing snakes.

572
00:28:08,428 --> 00:28:09,887
Hanging out with presidents.

573
00:28:09,888 --> 00:28:11,854
Now you worked for Elvis?

574
00:28:11,855 --> 00:28:13,086
- It's true.

575
00:28:13,087 --> 00:28:16,134
- The truth is you're pathetic.

576
00:28:16,135 --> 00:28:18,363
Telling lies to impress others.

577
00:28:18,364 --> 00:28:19,666
May be able to fool Barney,

578
00:28:19,667 --> 00:28:20,667
but not me.

579
00:28:21,620 --> 00:28:23,228
(Slow music)

580
00:28:23,229 --> 00:28:24,786
- Annie?

581
00:28:24,787 --> 00:28:26,237
- [Annie] Leave me alone!

582
00:28:26,238 --> 00:28:29,821
(Indistinct radio chatter)

583
00:28:32,036 --> 00:28:34,189
- [Holly] 85 bucks
is the cheapest one.

584
00:28:34,190 --> 00:28:36,487
It gets you here but
with a bunch of stops.

585
00:28:36,488 --> 00:28:39,071
- I don't care about the stops.

586
00:28:41,481 --> 00:28:45,134
110, enough for a
decent meal and a ticket.

587
00:28:45,135 --> 00:28:46,419
When is it?

588
00:28:46,420 --> 00:28:49,296
- [Holly] Tomorrow, 6:30 am.

589
00:28:49,297 --> 00:28:51,747
- Is there another one?

590
00:28:51,748 --> 00:28:53,392
- [Holly] Thursday.

591
00:28:53,393 --> 00:28:55,021
- Forget that.

592
00:28:55,022 --> 00:28:58,025
Just don't forget to pick
me up at the station, okay?

593
00:28:58,026 --> 00:28:59,384
- [Holly] You owe me one.

594
00:28:59,385 --> 00:29:00,554
Good luck.

595
00:29:00,555 --> 00:29:01,555
- Yeah.

596
00:29:05,251 --> 00:29:07,668
(Slow music)

597
00:29:13,364 --> 00:29:16,031
(Alarm beeping)

598
00:29:22,242 --> 00:29:24,492
Take that, you stupid bird.

599
00:29:26,851 --> 00:29:29,434
(Gentle music)

600
00:30:41,901 --> 00:30:42,901
Great.

601
00:30:50,088 --> 00:30:52,338
(Grunting)

602
00:30:54,949 --> 00:30:56,619
(Screaming)

603
00:30:56,620 --> 00:30:59,370
(Dramatic music)

604
00:31:01,512 --> 00:31:03,179
Help, somebody help!

605
00:31:06,579 --> 00:31:08,746
(Gasping)

606
00:31:10,066 --> 00:31:11,316
Help, somebody!

607
00:31:12,247 --> 00:31:14,414
(Gasping)

608
00:31:20,909 --> 00:31:22,076
Somebody help!

609
00:31:23,125 --> 00:31:24,542
Help, help, help!

610
00:31:26,990 --> 00:31:27,990
Help!

611
00:31:44,861 --> 00:31:45,861
- Annie!

612
00:31:49,448 --> 00:31:50,448
Annie!

613
00:32:01,068 --> 00:32:03,255
- Notice all the lace
that's hand tatted

614
00:32:03,256 --> 00:32:06,327
and the intricate and
delicate eyelet work.

615
00:32:06,328 --> 00:32:08,417
Now if you'll follow
me into the next room,

616
00:32:08,418 --> 00:32:10,424
I'll be showing you...

617
00:32:10,425 --> 00:32:12,381
(Phone beeping)

618
00:32:12,382 --> 00:32:13,596
- Will you stop already?

619
00:32:13,597 --> 00:32:14,963
You've been calling
it every five minutes.

620
00:32:14,964 --> 00:32:15,963
- I just want to
hear their voices.

621
00:32:15,964 --> 00:32:16,999
Make sure they're okay.

622
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,677
- I'm sure they're
having a great time.

623
00:32:18,678 --> 00:32:21,289
Unlike some people I know.

624
00:32:21,290 --> 00:32:24,913
Come on, all the good
stuff's in this room.

625
00:32:24,914 --> 00:32:27,414
(Dog panting)

626
00:32:38,903 --> 00:32:39,900
(Annie screaming)

627
00:32:39,901 --> 00:32:41,142
- No, it's all right, it's okay!

628
00:32:41,143 --> 00:32:42,625
- No, you stay away from me!

629
00:32:42,626 --> 00:32:44,310
- Sonia!
- You just stay back!

630
00:32:44,311 --> 00:32:45,308
Stay back!

631
00:32:45,309 --> 00:32:46,316
- What, what what?

632
00:32:46,317 --> 00:32:47,803
(Annie screaming)

633
00:32:47,804 --> 00:32:49,697
Relax, relax!

634
00:32:49,698 --> 00:32:50,998
- Who are you people?
- Just relax.

635
00:32:50,999 --> 00:32:52,657
Relax, I'm Sonia.

636
00:32:52,658 --> 00:32:53,729
This is Greg.

637
00:32:53,730 --> 00:32:54,730
You're safe.

638
00:32:57,580 --> 00:33:01,343
If it wasn't for Greg,
you'd still be under.

639
00:33:01,344 --> 00:33:02,897
- Grandpa's boat.

640
00:33:02,898 --> 00:33:03,898
Oh no.

641
00:33:08,028 --> 00:33:10,765
- We didn't catch your name.

642
00:33:10,766 --> 00:33:12,230
- Annie.

643
00:33:12,231 --> 00:33:14,843
- Well, Annie, your
clothes are drying.

644
00:33:14,844 --> 00:33:16,529
So I dressed you in these.

645
00:33:16,530 --> 00:33:17,819
- Your daughter's.

646
00:33:17,820 --> 00:33:20,438
- Greg's, his daughter Lauren.

647
00:33:20,439 --> 00:33:21,867
This is his house.

648
00:33:21,868 --> 00:33:23,563
You had us worried.

649
00:33:23,564 --> 00:33:25,723
I didn't know
who to call for you.

650
00:33:25,724 --> 00:33:28,098
No ID, no anything.

651
00:33:28,099 --> 00:33:30,849
Just a plastic
bag full of money.

652
00:33:36,379 --> 00:33:37,379
Hungry?

653
00:33:47,004 --> 00:33:48,871
Easy, easy child.

654
00:33:48,872 --> 00:33:52,289
There's plenty more
where that come from.

655
00:33:55,420 --> 00:33:58,003
(Gentle music)

656
00:34:07,010 --> 00:34:10,070
- I just wanted
to say thank you.

657
00:34:10,071 --> 00:34:11,071
- It's okay.

658
00:34:14,695 --> 00:34:16,225
- You build boats?

659
00:34:16,226 --> 00:34:17,227
- Not really.

660
00:34:17,228 --> 00:34:18,571
I'm a handyman.

661
00:34:18,572 --> 00:34:19,576
I fix things.

662
00:34:19,577 --> 00:34:22,438
- Greg's been helping folks
out around here for years.

663
00:34:22,439 --> 00:34:25,022
- The other night in the woods,

664
00:34:25,997 --> 00:34:28,029
I thought you were captain Jack.

665
00:34:28,030 --> 00:34:30,625
(Chuckling)

666
00:34:30,626 --> 00:34:32,609
- Greg's got a lot
of spirit, honey,

667
00:34:32,610 --> 00:34:35,254
but he ain't no ghost.

668
00:34:35,255 --> 00:34:36,296
- Yeah, I'm really sorry.

669
00:34:36,297 --> 00:34:38,763
The other night I was
picking up my groceries.

670
00:34:38,764 --> 00:34:40,627
I really didn't
mean to scare you.

671
00:34:40,628 --> 00:34:41,910
- You didn't.

672
00:34:41,911 --> 00:34:45,628
I mean, it was night
and like thick woods.

673
00:34:45,629 --> 00:34:46,944
You know.

674
00:34:46,945 --> 00:34:48,721
- [Sonia and Greg] City kid.

675
00:34:48,722 --> 00:34:49,755
- How'd you know?

676
00:34:49,756 --> 00:34:51,181
- Seen it all before.

677
00:34:51,182 --> 00:34:53,805
Y'all have a hard time
to adjusting down here.

678
00:34:53,806 --> 00:34:55,363
It's where's the mall!

679
00:34:55,364 --> 00:34:57,361
Where's the arcade?

680
00:34:57,362 --> 00:34:59,029
Where's my cable TV?

681
00:35:00,782 --> 00:35:03,279
- This is supposed
to be a vacation.

682
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:04,870
No fun.

683
00:35:04,871 --> 00:35:06,367
No hangouts.

684
00:35:06,368 --> 00:35:07,761
No cool music.

685
00:35:07,762 --> 00:35:10,827
I mean, there's just
nothing to do around here.

686
00:35:10,828 --> 00:35:13,598
- Well, down here we have
different kinds of music.

687
00:35:13,599 --> 00:35:15,678
You know, we have
the leaves and the trees

688
00:35:15,679 --> 00:35:17,878
and the sound of the birds.

689
00:35:17,879 --> 00:35:18,882
- Trust me.

690
00:35:18,883 --> 00:35:20,312
That bird waking
me up every morning

691
00:35:20,313 --> 00:35:21,835
deserves to be shot.

692
00:35:21,836 --> 00:35:24,290
(Chuckling)

693
00:35:24,291 --> 00:35:27,478
- Well, I bet your grandpa
has a collection of cool stuff.

694
00:35:27,479 --> 00:35:28,562
- Yeah, dust.

695
00:35:29,799 --> 00:35:31,466
And ancient records.

696
00:35:32,458 --> 00:35:35,497
Stuff like jazz and Tommy dorky.

697
00:35:35,498 --> 00:35:36,507
No young music.

698
00:35:36,508 --> 00:35:38,841
(Chuckling)

699
00:35:40,018 --> 00:35:41,339
What about your daughter?

700
00:35:41,340 --> 00:35:42,923
What does she like?

701
00:35:45,138 --> 00:35:48,165
- Well, you know, she, Lauren,

702
00:35:48,166 --> 00:35:49,583
she's likes uh...

703
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:54,063
- Your parents must
be worried about you.

704
00:35:54,064 --> 00:35:57,071
- I'm staying with my grandpa.

705
00:35:57,072 --> 00:35:59,014
- Well, Greg doesn't
have a phone,

706
00:35:59,015 --> 00:36:00,869
and I live just
right up the road.

707
00:36:00,870 --> 00:36:02,981
You can call him from there.

708
00:36:02,982 --> 00:36:05,982
- Actually, I don't
know his number.

709
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:10,045
- Well, you know his
address, don't you?

710
00:36:10,046 --> 00:36:11,296
- 17 something.

711
00:36:13,686 --> 00:36:16,838
- Well, we'll figure
something out.

712
00:36:16,839 --> 00:36:18,095
Come on.

713
00:36:18,096 --> 00:36:21,096
Let's go see if
the clothes are dry.

714
00:36:32,107 --> 00:36:33,295
- It's good!

715
00:36:33,296 --> 00:36:34,963
Give it to me again.

716
00:36:39,165 --> 00:36:41,363
Hey there, Sonia.

717
00:36:41,364 --> 00:36:43,101
You getting ready to MC
the festival again this year?

718
00:36:43,102 --> 00:36:44,553
- I'm looking forward to it.

719
00:36:44,554 --> 00:36:46,457
- You know, I've been
practicing real hard.

720
00:36:46,458 --> 00:36:47,845
Me, me, me.

721
00:36:47,846 --> 00:36:50,162
(Chuckling)

722
00:36:50,163 --> 00:36:52,768
So what brings you back
to the old sweat shop?

723
00:36:52,769 --> 00:36:55,560
- Well, my friend is
looking for her grandpa,

724
00:36:55,561 --> 00:36:56,881
Donald Brooks.

725
00:36:56,882 --> 00:36:58,243
You know him?

726
00:36:58,244 --> 00:37:02,411
(Indistinct police
radio chatter)

727
00:37:04,565 --> 00:37:08,732
- Well, it looks like we
found our missing person.

728
00:37:10,234 --> 00:37:12,651
(Slow music)

729
00:37:40,155 --> 00:37:41,373
- Hey there.

730
00:37:41,374 --> 00:37:42,985
Anybody up for a game of rummy?

731
00:37:42,986 --> 00:37:45,735
- Where the heck
have you two been?

732
00:37:45,736 --> 00:37:48,102
- Or maybe solitaire.

733
00:37:48,103 --> 00:37:50,156
- We've been calling
and calling worried sick

734
00:37:50,157 --> 00:37:51,399
about you two.

735
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:52,404
- [Father] You were calling.

736
00:37:52,405 --> 00:37:53,570
I said they were fine.

737
00:37:53,571 --> 00:37:55,937
- All right, let's have it.

738
00:37:55,938 --> 00:37:56,938
- Mom...

739
00:37:57,763 --> 00:37:59,538
- It was all my fault.

740
00:37:59,539 --> 00:38:01,218
I dragged her into harbour town

741
00:38:01,219 --> 00:38:03,090
because I had to
run some errands.

742
00:38:03,091 --> 00:38:05,149
- All day long?

743
00:38:05,150 --> 00:38:07,116
- We had some car trouble.

744
00:38:07,117 --> 00:38:08,216
- What is wrong with you?

745
00:38:08,217 --> 00:38:10,052
Didn't it occur to you that
this godforsaken jalopy

746
00:38:10,053 --> 00:38:13,084
might break down or worse
yet, get in an accident?

747
00:38:13,085 --> 00:38:14,603
- I'm sorry.

748
00:38:14,604 --> 00:38:15,847
- You're the adult here.

749
00:38:15,848 --> 00:38:17,148
It seems like
Annie's got a lot more

750
00:38:17,149 --> 00:38:18,783
common sense than you do.

751
00:38:18,784 --> 00:38:20,018
- [Father] Carol.

752
00:38:20,019 --> 00:38:21,141
- Don't Carol me.

753
00:38:21,142 --> 00:38:23,917
I have every reason to be angry.

754
00:38:23,918 --> 00:38:26,821
Annie, you go inside now.

755
00:38:26,822 --> 00:38:27,822
Go.

756
00:38:29,435 --> 00:38:30,435
Go!

757
00:38:35,081 --> 00:38:37,031
We were calling and
calling and raced back here

758
00:38:37,032 --> 00:38:37,990
to sit on that porch

759
00:38:37,991 --> 00:38:39,708
and wait for you for an hour.

760
00:38:39,709 --> 00:38:41,680
Then it just turns out
that you're driving around

761
00:38:41,681 --> 00:38:44,777
in this clunker, doing errands.

762
00:38:44,778 --> 00:38:47,263
- [Grandpa] We just thought
it would take a few minutes.

763
00:38:47,264 --> 00:38:49,238
- [Carol] Why didn't you call?

764
00:38:49,239 --> 00:38:50,628
- I don't have one
of those cell phones.

765
00:38:50,629 --> 00:38:51,852
- Well there are payphones.

766
00:38:51,853 --> 00:38:52,857
Didn't you listen to me?

767
00:38:52,858 --> 00:38:53,884
I didn't want Annie to go.

768
00:38:53,885 --> 00:38:56,033
- I didn't know
you were telling me

769
00:38:56,034 --> 00:38:57,951
not to leave the house.

770
00:39:04,852 --> 00:39:05,852
- You okay?

771
00:39:07,410 --> 00:39:08,410
- Yeah.

772
00:39:09,541 --> 00:39:11,029
It's just,

773
00:39:11,030 --> 00:39:13,770
why does she have
to be so hard on him?

774
00:39:13,771 --> 00:39:16,986
- Well, you know your
mom and grandpa Don,

775
00:39:16,987 --> 00:39:19,713
they don't always get along.

776
00:39:19,714 --> 00:39:23,104
It's kind of been
like that for awhile.

777
00:39:23,105 --> 00:39:25,970
- So then why did we come here?

778
00:39:25,971 --> 00:39:29,259
- Well Annie,
family is important.

779
00:39:29,260 --> 00:39:30,758
And just because you
don't agree with everybody

780
00:39:30,759 --> 00:39:34,009
doesn't mean you
don't care about them.

781
00:39:36,828 --> 00:39:37,828
- Dad,

782
00:39:39,594 --> 00:39:40,594
this morning

783
00:39:41,522 --> 00:39:42,522
I,

784
00:39:45,260 --> 00:39:46,260
I,

785
00:39:47,964 --> 00:39:49,214
I got up early.

786
00:39:50,258 --> 00:39:53,339
I've been having
trouble sleeping.

787
00:39:53,340 --> 00:39:54,614
- Do you want to
pack up your stuff

788
00:39:54,615 --> 00:39:56,028
and stay with us tonight?

789
00:39:56,029 --> 00:39:57,279
- No, I'm fine.

790
00:39:58,636 --> 00:39:59,640
- You sure?

791
00:39:59,641 --> 00:40:00,641
- Really.

792
00:40:02,306 --> 00:40:05,973
Plus you and mom
deserves some quality time.

793
00:40:08,466 --> 00:40:09,670
(Gentle piano music)

794
00:40:09,671 --> 00:40:12,921
- It's a very
considerate thing to say.

795
00:40:13,899 --> 00:40:16,149
What's it going to cost me?

796
00:40:31,927 --> 00:40:34,510
(Soft snoring)

797
00:41:08,310 --> 00:41:11,227

798
00:42:40,514 --> 00:42:43,097

(Chuckling)

00:44:09,326 --> 00:44:10,794

00:44:10,795 --> 00:44:11,795
I just...

811
00:44:13,758 --> 00:44:16,508
- I'm just glad
you're all right.

812
00:44:20,784 --> 00:44:23,117
- What was grandma Dee like?

813
00:44:24,534 --> 00:44:26,138
- She was nice.

814
00:44:26,139 --> 00:44:28,139
She was very nice.

815
00:44:28,140 --> 00:44:31,723
- No, I mean I really
want to know, really.

816
00:44:36,307 --> 00:44:39,071
- When I first met her
I had goosebumps.

817
00:44:39,072 --> 00:44:41,735
She was a cheerleader
from the rival high school team

818
00:44:41,736 --> 00:44:42,970
across town.

819
00:44:42,971 --> 00:44:45,583
I was a wide receiver and
I was trying to impress her

820
00:44:45,584 --> 00:44:47,612
with my acrobatic catches.

821
00:44:47,613 --> 00:44:49,973
On this one play I
ran out of bounds,

822
00:44:49,974 --> 00:44:51,738
and I ran right up to her

823
00:44:51,739 --> 00:44:54,197
and she said, "who are you?"

824
00:44:54,198 --> 00:44:56,810
And I said, "I'm the man
you're going to marry someday."

825
00:44:56,811 --> 00:44:57,808
- No way.

826
00:44:57,808 --> 00:44:58,806
- Yeah.

827
00:44:58,807 --> 00:44:59,839
She didn't want
to date me at first.

828
00:44:59,840 --> 00:45:04,572
But I sent her a single yellow
Rose every day for two weeks.

829
00:45:04,573 --> 00:45:06,238
And she finally gave in,

830
00:45:06,239 --> 00:45:09,489
and after a few
years she said, "I do."

831
00:45:11,004 --> 00:45:13,302
- How long were you married?

832
00:45:13,303 --> 00:45:17,553
- This August would have
been our 48th anniversary.

833
00:45:21,504 --> 00:45:23,220
- I'm so sorry.

834
00:45:23,221 --> 00:45:24,416
I really didn't mean...

835
00:45:24,417 --> 00:45:25,999
- No, no it's all right.

836
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:27,269
She's still here.

837
00:45:27,270 --> 00:45:29,155
She's all over this house.

838
00:45:29,156 --> 00:45:31,938
That chess set there
is a good example.

839
00:45:31,939 --> 00:45:33,106
Bring it over.

840
00:45:38,006 --> 00:45:39,006
That's it.

841
00:45:41,612 --> 00:45:44,445
Your grandma
gave me this in 1957.

842
00:45:47,089 --> 00:45:48,756
She had it engraved.

843
00:45:55,440 --> 00:45:57,273
- To Donald, love Dee.

844
00:45:58,229 --> 00:45:59,229
August 1957.

845
00:46:02,107 --> 00:46:03,107
Wow.

846
00:46:04,492 --> 00:46:05,742
It's beautiful.

847
00:46:06,784 --> 00:46:09,201
Can you teach me how to play?

848
00:46:10,219 --> 00:46:12,286
- On one condition.

849
00:46:12,287 --> 00:46:14,040
- What's that?

850
00:46:14,041 --> 00:46:16,243
- That we'll go out and
buy you a new wardrobe.

851
00:46:16,244 --> 00:46:19,344
That one outfit is
not going to cut it.

852
00:46:19,345 --> 00:46:20,575
Okay.

853
00:46:20,576 --> 00:46:23,488

00:49:02,431 --> 00:49:03,431
- Bye.

909
00:49:05,999 --> 00:49:07,499
- Hi, bye, smooth.

910
00:49:08,811 --> 00:49:11,582
- Oh be quiet.
- Very smooth.

911
00:49:11,583 --> 00:49:13,941
I'm gonna have to meet
Barney at the drug store.

912
00:49:13,942 --> 00:49:14,942
Uh oh.

913
00:49:20,680 --> 00:49:21,992
Howdy, sheriff.

914
00:49:21,993 --> 00:49:22,993
- Donald.

915
00:49:24,126 --> 00:49:26,141
Well, there's Annie.

916
00:49:26,142 --> 00:49:29,266
Master and commander
of the Donald one.

917
00:49:29,267 --> 00:49:31,100
Ever find your vessel?

918
00:49:33,774 --> 00:49:34,806
This your car?

919
00:49:34,807 --> 00:49:36,167
- Yes sir.

920
00:49:36,168 --> 00:49:37,510
- Runs like panther.

921
00:49:37,511 --> 00:49:38,511
- Uh huh.

922
00:49:42,563 --> 00:49:43,937
What was it, 56?

923
00:49:43,938 --> 00:49:44,938
- 55.
- 55.

924
00:49:46,008 --> 00:49:47,613
It's a good idea taking
two spots like that.

925
00:49:47,614 --> 00:49:49,781
That way nobody bumps it.

926
00:49:54,444 --> 00:49:57,861
Yeah, I was just
admiring an old classic.

927
00:50:00,412 --> 00:50:04,332
Use a coat of wax,
though, don't you think?

928
00:50:04,333 --> 00:50:06,272
Good luck finding your boat.

929
00:50:06,273 --> 00:50:09,606
I'll let you know if
anything washes up.

930
00:50:14,196 --> 00:50:15,375
(Indistinct radio chatter)
- See if we can find

931
00:50:15,376 --> 00:50:17,126
some real music here.

932
00:50:18,406 --> 00:50:19,963
Hey, there we go.

933
00:50:19,964 --> 00:50:20,797
- Remember that?

934
00:50:20,798 --> 00:50:22,109
- Sure, remember it, I owned it.

935
00:50:22,110 --> 00:50:24,024
That's great.

936
00:50:24,025 --> 00:50:26,761
Oh yeah, takes you back, huh?

937
00:50:26,762 --> 00:50:28,359
- Grandpa, can I drive?

938
00:50:28,360 --> 00:50:30,374
- What, you wanna get us killed?

939
00:50:30,375 --> 00:50:31,521
- Oh come on.

940
00:50:31,522 --> 00:50:33,494
- No, what if a cop saw us

941
00:50:33,495 --> 00:50:35,083
or worse, your mother.

942
00:50:35,084 --> 00:50:36,907
- There are only three
cops on this island.

943
00:50:36,908 --> 00:50:39,301
And all I do is play
paper football all day.

944
00:50:39,302 --> 00:50:41,384
- Look, driving a
car is a little harder

945
00:50:41,385 --> 00:50:42,993
than driving a boat,

946
00:50:42,994 --> 00:50:45,101
and I think we all know
how that turned out, Missy.

947
00:50:45,102 --> 00:50:46,267
- I don't know, Annie.

948
00:50:46,268 --> 00:50:48,427
- Okay, I guess
when I'm your age

949
00:50:48,428 --> 00:50:49,804
I won't be able to
tell my grandkids

950
00:50:49,805 --> 00:50:51,953
my grandpa taught
me how to drive.

951
00:50:51,954 --> 00:50:55,553
Just have to tell them some
random boyfriend did it instead.

952
00:50:55,554 --> 00:50:57,561
(Tires screeching)

953
00:50:57,562 --> 00:50:59,396
- [Barney] Are
you crazy, captain?

954
00:50:59,397 --> 00:51:01,531
- [Grandpa] Oh, don't get
your panties in a bunch.

955
00:51:01,532 --> 00:51:02,530
Live a little.

956
00:51:02,531 --> 00:51:03,681
- [Barney] Yeah, well
I'd like to live a lot.

957
00:51:03,682 --> 00:51:08,099
That's the problem.
(Whimsical music)

958
00:51:09,398 --> 00:51:11,066
- You'll be okay, Barney.

959
00:51:11,067 --> 00:51:12,079
I'm a good driver.

960
00:51:12,080 --> 00:51:13,482
- Yeah, I just hope
they spell my name right

961
00:51:13,483 --> 00:51:14,983
in the obituaries.

962
00:51:16,815 --> 00:51:18,398
Take it easy, yeah.

963
00:51:21,931 --> 00:51:24,955
- Turn a little bit to
your right, to your right.

964
00:51:24,956 --> 00:51:27,127
- Just watch out,
watch out, there's a...

965
00:51:27,128 --> 00:51:28,128
- Oh oh!

966
00:51:29,537 --> 00:51:31,204
- Are you happy now?

967
00:51:32,287 --> 00:51:33,934
Why don't we practice stopping.

968
00:51:33,935 --> 00:51:36,419
Let's practice stopping.

969
00:51:36,420 --> 00:51:39,337
Practice pulling
over and stopping.

970
00:51:44,148 --> 00:51:45,161
- Thank you very much.

971
00:51:45,162 --> 00:51:46,162
- Ma'am.

972
00:51:46,868 --> 00:51:48,211
- I think Mr. Brooks
will fit in quite nicely

973
00:51:48,212 --> 00:51:49,582
to our little community here.

974
00:51:49,583 --> 00:51:50,420
- Thank you, Mr. Bailey.

975
00:51:50,420 --> 00:51:51,253
Thanks for showing us around.

976
00:51:51,254 --> 00:51:52,660
- [Bailey] You have my
card if you need anything.

977
00:51:52,661 --> 00:51:56,578
- [Father] Thanks. (Slow music)

978
00:51:57,490 --> 00:51:58,490
Carol?

979
00:52:08,246 --> 00:52:10,746
- Is this what it's all about?

980
00:52:11,918 --> 00:52:13,646
- This one seems
like a nice place.

981
00:52:13,647 --> 00:52:15,284
- I mean for us.

982
00:52:15,285 --> 00:52:17,678
- Don't you think you're
jumping the gun a little?

983
00:52:17,679 --> 00:52:21,065
Unless they offer an
early bird discount.

984
00:52:21,066 --> 00:52:24,377
- Would you remarry
if I were, you know...

985
00:52:24,378 --> 00:52:25,956
- What?

986
00:52:25,957 --> 00:52:27,582
- Because I'm
telling you I would.

987
00:52:27,583 --> 00:52:28,671
I don't like to be alone.

988
00:52:28,672 --> 00:52:29,672
It's scary.

989
00:52:32,620 --> 00:52:34,585
I know we're not always happy.

990
00:52:34,586 --> 00:52:38,586
- Honey, I don't know
anyone who's always happy.

991
00:52:39,460 --> 00:52:40,293
You know, it's hard.

992
00:52:40,294 --> 00:52:42,793
Long business hours and trips,

993
00:52:44,585 --> 00:52:46,813
and it's just the
way it is for now.

994
00:52:46,814 --> 00:52:48,114
- Yeah.

995
00:52:48,115 --> 00:52:49,747
I grew up that way.

996
00:52:49,748 --> 00:52:51,096
My daddy was always gone.

997
00:52:51,097 --> 00:52:53,522
He was never there for me,

998
00:52:53,523 --> 00:52:55,023
and I resented it,

999
00:52:56,143 --> 00:52:57,912
and now I'm putting him here.

1000
00:52:57,913 --> 00:52:59,944
I know it's the
responsible thing to do.

1001
00:52:59,945 --> 00:53:04,195
One day Annie's gonna
do the responsible thing too.

1002
00:53:06,141 --> 00:53:07,635
- Yeah, well maybe to you.

1003
00:53:07,636 --> 00:53:08,719
She likes me.

1004
00:53:10,167 --> 00:53:11,769
- That's it.

1005
00:53:11,770 --> 00:53:12,770
That's it!

1006
00:53:56,299 --> 00:53:58,896
- Annie, you're not
going to believe this.

1007
00:53:58,897 --> 00:53:59,897
- What?

1008
00:54:00,944 --> 00:54:02,389
- That's checkmate.

1009
00:54:02,390 --> 00:54:03,390
- It is?

1010
00:54:04,379 --> 00:54:05,679
- [Grandpa] You win.

1011
00:54:05,680 --> 00:54:07,109
- I win?

1012
00:54:07,110 --> 00:54:08,107
I beat you?

1013
00:54:08,108 --> 00:54:09,530
I beat you!

1014
00:54:09,531 --> 00:54:11,484
Yippee, I did it!

1015
00:54:11,485 --> 00:54:12,887
Finally I...
- What's all the racket?

1016
00:54:12,888 --> 00:54:14,923
- I just beat grandpa at chess!

1017
00:54:14,924 --> 00:54:18,091
Yes! (Whimsical music)

1018
00:54:49,768 --> 00:54:52,935
(Gentle guitar music)

1019
00:55:17,437 --> 00:55:18,604
- Oh wow, hey.

1020
00:55:21,618 --> 00:55:25,682
I was just putting
away some old stuff.

1021
00:55:25,683 --> 00:55:27,350
Just messing around.

1022
00:55:30,722 --> 00:55:33,829
- I made you some frogmore
stew and hoppin' John.

1023
00:55:33,830 --> 00:55:36,163
Thought you might be hungry.

1024
00:55:37,385 --> 00:55:38,385
- Thanks.

1025
00:55:40,666 --> 00:55:41,666
- Um hum.

1026
00:55:48,116 --> 00:55:49,283
Sounded good.

1027
00:55:55,067 --> 00:55:56,595
- [Grandpa] That's
fresh local shrimp, Annie.

1028
00:55:56,596 --> 00:55:58,049
Best you can get.

1029
00:55:58,050 --> 00:56:01,751
- Wow, grandma's famous
seafood gumbo is a lot of work.

1030
00:56:01,752 --> 00:56:04,624
- Yeah, I can't say I
always helped out either.

1031
00:56:04,625 --> 00:56:07,244
I usually found some
excuse or other to get out of it.

1032
00:56:07,245 --> 00:56:09,484
- Kind of like me with mom.

1033
00:56:09,485 --> 00:56:11,136
I guess we're a
lot of like, huh?

1034
00:56:11,137 --> 00:56:12,449
- Yeah.

1035
00:56:12,450 --> 00:56:13,863
Of course the thing
is, I regret it now.

1036
00:56:13,864 --> 00:56:15,361
All those,

1037
00:56:15,362 --> 00:56:18,175
all those times I could
have been with her,

1038
00:56:18,176 --> 00:56:19,259
and I wasn't.

1039
00:56:20,949 --> 00:56:23,641
- It was lung cancer, right?

1040
00:56:23,642 --> 00:56:24,642
- Yeah.

1041
00:56:27,749 --> 00:56:29,760
- Don't be like me, Annie girl.

1042
00:56:29,761 --> 00:56:31,713
Be better than me.

1043
00:56:31,714 --> 00:56:35,214
Find time for those
people you care about.

1044
00:56:36,690 --> 00:56:40,821
(Door slamming) (Woman shouting)

1045
00:56:40,822 --> 00:56:42,156
- Are you okay?

1046
00:56:42,157 --> 00:56:43,219
- Carol?

1047
00:56:43,220 --> 00:56:44,220
- She's fine.

1048
00:56:44,221 --> 00:56:45,219
- I'm not fine.

1049
00:56:45,220 --> 00:56:47,404
That dumb thing
almost killed me.

1050
00:56:47,405 --> 00:56:49,304
(Loud crashing)

1051
00:56:49,305 --> 00:56:52,542
- Can't believe you forgot
about my security system.

1052
00:56:52,543 --> 00:56:54,970
- Yeah, it usually prevents
people from spying.

1053
00:56:54,971 --> 00:56:56,471
- I wasn't spying.

1054
00:56:59,875 --> 00:57:00,988
- This is really good.

1055
00:57:00,989 --> 00:57:02,320
- Um hum.

1056
00:57:02,321 --> 00:57:04,631
- We copied it exactly
from grandma's old recipe.

1057
00:57:04,632 --> 00:57:08,892
- I'm pretty sure daddy
didn't do it from memory.

1058
00:57:08,893 --> 00:57:10,818
- Annie, you should ask your
mother how I used to find her

1059
00:57:10,819 --> 00:57:13,095
when she ran away from home.

1060
00:57:13,096 --> 00:57:14,763
- You used to ditch?

1061
00:57:15,939 --> 00:57:17,542
- Wasn't on for
that leaky container

1062
00:57:17,543 --> 00:57:19,218
I might've made it
all the way to Alaska.

1063
00:57:19,219 --> 00:57:21,175
(Chuckling)

1064
00:57:21,176 --> 00:57:22,856
- Container?

1065
00:57:22,857 --> 00:57:24,506
This little rebel
one day decided

1066
00:57:24,507 --> 00:57:26,166
to pack up and leave, right?

1067
00:57:26,167 --> 00:57:28,791
I look outside and there's
a trail of seafood gumbo

1068
00:57:28,792 --> 00:57:30,231
all the way to the main road.

1069
00:57:30,232 --> 00:57:31,591
- No way.

1070
00:57:31,592 --> 00:57:33,287
- I followed it to
the drain depot.

1071
00:57:33,288 --> 00:57:37,428
And there she was
with a wet pillowcase.

1072
00:57:37,429 --> 00:57:39,096
- I love that story.

1073
00:57:40,205 --> 00:57:41,623
You did some crazy
things when you were a kid.

1074
00:57:41,624 --> 00:57:42,621
You were a rebel.

1075
00:57:42,622 --> 00:57:45,204
- I had a lot to rebel against.

1076
00:57:50,794 --> 00:57:53,525
- So what have you
guys been up to?

1077
00:57:53,526 --> 00:57:55,221
- Nothing much.

1078
00:57:55,222 --> 00:57:56,506
Just buying junk food,

1079
00:57:56,507 --> 00:57:57,952
trying on bikinis.

1080
00:57:57,953 --> 00:57:59,129
Grandpa let me drive his car,

1081
00:57:59,130 --> 00:58:02,130
and oh yeah, we
always got arrested.

1082
00:58:03,894 --> 00:58:04,977
- Ha, ha, ha.

1083
00:58:06,364 --> 00:58:09,755
- The detail in this
furniture was incredible.

1084
00:58:09,756 --> 00:58:11,621
And to think that you
were sitting in a chair

1085
00:58:11,622 --> 00:58:13,258
that was 150 years old.

1086
00:58:13,259 --> 00:58:16,088
- Wow, that's
almost as old as I am.

1087
00:58:16,089 --> 00:58:17,395
- You take any pictures?

1088
00:58:17,396 --> 00:58:18,395
- Yeah a bunch.

1089
00:58:18,395 --> 00:58:19,228
Go get mom's camera.

1090
00:58:19,228 --> 00:58:20,061
I'll show them to you.

1091
00:58:20,062 --> 00:58:21,119
- Cool.

1092
00:58:21,120 --> 00:58:22,552
- Honey, is that a new shirt?

1093
00:58:22,553 --> 00:58:24,221
I don't remember
seeing it before.

1094
00:58:24,222 --> 00:58:25,533
- This old thing?

1095
00:58:25,534 --> 00:58:29,034
You really hit your
head hard, didn't you?

1096
00:58:31,715 --> 00:58:34,798
(Indistinct chatter)

1097
00:58:38,387 --> 00:58:41,304
(Slow piano music)

1098
00:58:43,133 --> 00:58:44,466
Retirement home?

1099
00:58:58,402 --> 00:59:01,221
- [Father] Annie,
you finding it okay?

1100
00:59:01,222 --> 00:59:03,805
- Be right out.
- [Father] Okay.

1101
00:59:41,690 --> 00:59:45,298
(Knocking on door)

1102
00:59:45,299 --> 00:59:47,684
- Goodnight, Annie.

1103
00:59:47,685 --> 00:59:48,685
You okay?

1104
00:59:49,508 --> 00:59:50,341
- Yeah.

1105
00:59:50,341 --> 00:59:51,341
- You sure?

1106
00:59:54,657 --> 00:59:55,657
- Grandpa?

1107
00:59:56,602 --> 00:59:57,602
- Yeah?

1108
00:59:58,783 --> 00:59:59,783
- Nevermind.

1109
01:00:06,421 --> 01:00:07,421
I love you.

1110
01:01:01,659 --> 01:01:03,471
- You are going
down today, captain.

1111
01:01:03,472 --> 01:01:05,410
I feel like king rummy.

1112
01:01:05,411 --> 01:01:07,091
- You mean king dummy?

1113
01:01:07,092 --> 01:01:08,682
- Ha, ha, ha, you wish.

1114
01:01:08,683 --> 01:01:10,178
- Can I go visit Ashley?

1115
01:01:10,179 --> 01:01:12,399
- Are you tired of
us old croakers?

1116
01:01:12,400 --> 01:01:13,418
- See you.

1117
01:01:13,419 --> 01:01:16,175
- Now you tell her no
screaming, pop rock, hippity hop

1118
01:01:16,176 --> 01:01:17,903
jam sessions over there.

1119
01:01:17,904 --> 01:01:20,015
- You're really hip.

1120
01:01:20,016 --> 01:01:23,253
- It's hip, as in replacement.

1121
01:01:23,254 --> 01:01:24,921
- You too?
- Um hum.

1122
01:01:28,758 --> 01:01:29,780
- Hey ash.

1123
01:01:29,781 --> 01:01:31,193
- Cool chick.

1124
01:01:31,194 --> 01:01:33,514
- [Annie] I heard you
were back in town.

1125
01:01:33,515 --> 01:01:34,965
How was L.A.?

1126
01:01:34,966 --> 01:01:36,372
- I got bumped,

1127
01:01:36,373 --> 01:01:38,312
postponed by outcast.

1128
01:01:38,313 --> 01:01:39,606
- No way?

1129
01:01:39,607 --> 01:01:40,713
- I was in the
studio getting ready

1130
01:01:40,714 --> 01:01:42,117
to lay down my vocs, right?

1131
01:01:42,118 --> 01:01:43,561
Producer gets a phone call.

1132
01:01:43,562 --> 01:01:45,743
Andre 3000 needs the studio.

1133
01:01:45,744 --> 01:01:47,796
- He told you that?

1134
01:01:47,797 --> 01:01:49,945
- Well, no, but he
told my boyfriend.

1135
01:01:49,946 --> 01:01:50,944
I mean, I was there.

1136
01:01:50,945 --> 01:01:52,036
I know what went down.

1137
01:01:52,037 --> 01:01:54,111
All political, you know.

1138
01:01:54,112 --> 01:01:58,612
I heard you got thrown in
the clink for kifing a boat.

1139
01:01:59,544 --> 01:02:03,716
- I need your help with a
secret, girls only mission.

1140
01:02:03,717 --> 01:02:05,367
Interested?

1141
01:02:05,368 --> 01:02:07,409
- Will it effect
Barney if he finds out?

1142
01:02:07,410 --> 01:02:08,410
- Probably.

1143
01:02:09,433 --> 01:02:10,751
- What do you have in mind?

1144
01:02:10,752 --> 01:02:13,585
(Whimsical music)

1145
01:02:20,747 --> 01:02:24,052
- Gramps, I'm
taking Annie fishing.

1146
01:02:24,053 --> 01:02:25,839
Don't worry, I'll be safe.

1147
01:02:25,840 --> 01:02:29,968
- All right, but do
not let Annie drive.

1148
01:02:29,969 --> 01:02:30,969
- What?

1149
01:02:31,749 --> 01:02:33,681
This family cannot drive.

1150
01:02:33,682 --> 01:02:35,446
- Oh, well what do you call it

1151
01:02:35,447 --> 01:02:36,571
when you ran into
the old oak tree

1152
01:02:36,572 --> 01:02:38,000
down by the bridge last summer?

1153
01:02:38,001 --> 01:02:39,643
- Because there
was a cat in the road.

1154
01:02:39,644 --> 01:02:41,654
I had to swerve to miss the cat.

1155
01:02:41,655 --> 01:02:43,387
It's called defensive drive.

1156
01:02:43,388 --> 01:02:45,078
- Offensive driving
is more like it.

1157
01:02:45,079 --> 01:02:46,925
- I ever tell you the
story about that cat?

1158
01:02:46,926 --> 01:02:48,161
- Four times.

1159
01:02:48,162 --> 01:02:50,353
- Well you tell me yours 400.

1160
01:02:50,354 --> 01:02:52,297
- [Grandpa] Just mail
your stories to me, will you?

1161
01:02:52,298 --> 01:02:53,581
- [Barney] Well yours
would be about 800 pages

1162
01:02:53,582 --> 01:02:54,786
if you printed them out.

1163
01:02:54,787 --> 01:02:57,912
- [Grandpa] Are we going
to play cards or what?

1164
01:02:57,913 --> 01:02:59,910
(Engine humming)

1165
01:02:59,911 --> 01:03:02,092
- [Annie] This is great!

1166
01:03:02,093 --> 01:03:04,676
(Gentle music)

1167
01:03:13,793 --> 01:03:15,210
Go faster.
- Okay!

1168
01:03:19,927 --> 01:03:21,094
- Faster, ash!

1169
01:03:26,670 --> 01:03:29,503
(Hammer pounding)

1170
01:03:33,584 --> 01:03:35,115
Hi Greg!

1171
01:03:35,116 --> 01:03:37,912
(Horn honking)

1172
01:03:37,913 --> 01:03:41,830
- Oh man, I hope she
didn't steal another boat.

1173
01:03:47,949 --> 01:03:49,142
- Glad you're home.

1174
01:03:49,143 --> 01:03:50,604
- Thanks.

1175
01:03:50,605 --> 01:03:52,091
Does your grandpa
know you're here?

1176
01:03:52,092 --> 01:03:53,323
- No.

1177
01:03:53,324 --> 01:03:54,956
- Annie!

1178
01:03:54,957 --> 01:03:56,439
- It's okay, I've got
my friend with me.

1179
01:03:56,440 --> 01:03:57,857
Ashley, this is...

1180
01:03:59,069 --> 01:04:00,394
- Greg Russell.

1181
01:04:00,395 --> 01:04:01,750
- Yeah.

1182
01:04:01,751 --> 01:04:02,844
- You know him?

1183
01:04:02,845 --> 01:04:04,038
- Are you kidding?

1184
01:04:04,039 --> 01:04:06,091
You were a huge
inspiration to me growing up.

1185
01:04:06,092 --> 01:04:07,561
Watching you and harbour town.

1186
01:04:07,562 --> 01:04:08,991
Green-eyed monster.

1187
01:04:08,992 --> 01:04:10,286
I love this harbor.

1188
01:04:10,287 --> 01:04:11,353
The unicorn song.

1189
01:04:11,354 --> 01:04:12,873
I know them all by heart.

1190
01:04:12,874 --> 01:04:14,290
- Great, that's nice, thanks.

1191
01:04:14,291 --> 01:04:15,923
- Well what happened to you?

1192
01:04:15,924 --> 01:04:17,539
You look all beat up.

1193
01:04:17,540 --> 01:04:18,800
And why'd you stop singing?

1194
01:04:18,801 --> 01:04:20,579
I mean you just disappeared.

1195
01:04:20,580 --> 01:04:21,753
- I don't know.

1196
01:04:21,754 --> 01:04:23,133
- Sing us a tune.
- No.

1197
01:04:23,134 --> 01:04:24,137
- A duet.

1198
01:04:24,138 --> 01:04:26,350
We could do a rad
version of I love this harbor.

1199
01:04:26,351 --> 01:04:30,006
- Listen, I just don't
sing anymore, all right.

1200
01:04:30,007 --> 01:04:31,438
I'm really sorry.

1201
01:04:31,439 --> 01:04:33,106
I've got work to do.

1202
01:04:34,374 --> 01:04:35,457
- Greg, wait.

1203
01:04:37,092 --> 01:04:38,995
I came for help.

1204
01:04:38,996 --> 01:04:42,121
I need you to fix something.

1205
01:04:42,122 --> 01:04:43,122
My family.

1206
01:04:45,821 --> 01:04:48,760
- [Ashley] Now this is a
nice house right by the beach.

1207
01:04:48,761 --> 01:04:52,857
- [Annie] Yeah.
(Doorbell ringing)

1208
01:04:52,858 --> 01:04:56,664
- Well look what
the cat dragged here.

1209
01:04:56,665 --> 01:04:58,558
- [Annie] I found it
in my mom's purse.

1210
01:04:58,559 --> 01:05:02,062
I just know they're going to
put him in a retirement home.

1211
01:05:02,063 --> 01:05:05,219
- [Ashley] Annie,
his house is a dump.

1212
01:05:05,220 --> 01:05:08,720
- [Annie] I really need
your help, please.

1213
01:05:10,918 --> 01:05:15,501
- So your grandfather doesn't
know anything about this?

1214
01:05:17,349 --> 01:05:20,832
You're talking lots of home
improvements here, Annie.

1215
01:05:20,833 --> 01:05:23,079
- I know, but if we
can just show my mom

1216
01:05:23,080 --> 01:05:24,825
that grandpa's
turned his life around,

1217
01:05:24,826 --> 01:05:26,658
I know she'll let him stay.

1218
01:05:26,659 --> 01:05:30,409
Look, there's over a
hundred dollars in here.

1219
01:05:31,873 --> 01:05:33,823
I'm sure you charge more,

1220
01:05:33,824 --> 01:05:36,485
but maybe I can
work it off for you.

1221
01:05:36,486 --> 01:05:38,453
- Could buy some paint,

1222
01:05:38,454 --> 01:05:39,824
some brushes.

1223
01:05:39,825 --> 01:05:42,805
- You know, if we sold
some of this stuff off,

1224
01:05:42,806 --> 01:05:44,408
we could buy him a new house.

1225
01:05:44,409 --> 01:05:45,421
(Chuckling)

1226
01:05:45,422 --> 01:05:47,091
- Yeah, I didn't know
having a beauty salon

1227
01:05:47,092 --> 01:05:48,576
could make you a billionaire.

1228
01:05:48,577 --> 01:05:50,424
- Sugar, I may own
my own beauty salon,

1229
01:05:50,425 --> 01:05:53,748
but there is not that much
money in dye jobs and perms.

1230
01:05:53,749 --> 01:05:55,752
Generations of my family worked

1231
01:05:55,753 --> 01:05:57,251
for the owners of this house.

1232
01:05:57,252 --> 01:06:01,085
The last owner was like
a second father to me.

1233
01:06:02,303 --> 01:06:05,419
He passed and he left
me the house in his will.

1234
01:06:05,420 --> 01:06:09,753
- Good thing you never put
him in a retirement home.

1235
01:06:10,937 --> 01:06:11,937
- City kid.

1236
01:06:14,322 --> 01:06:16,991
- So how do you plan on
getting your grandfather

1237
01:06:16,992 --> 01:06:19,703
out of the house for the day?

1238
01:06:19,704 --> 01:06:22,621
- Haven't figured
that one out yet.

1239
01:06:27,738 --> 01:06:29,155
- I have an idea.

1240
01:06:30,164 --> 01:06:33,241
(Cheerful music)
- [Grandpa] Beauty salon?

1241
01:06:33,242 --> 01:06:34,343
- Congratulations.

1242
01:06:34,344 --> 01:06:35,988
You have been randomly
selected to receive

1243
01:06:35,989 --> 01:06:38,035
our special king
for a day makeover,

1244
01:06:38,036 --> 01:06:41,102
compliments of
Sonia's beauty palace.

1245
01:06:41,103 --> 01:06:42,569
- I don't need a make over.

1246
01:06:42,570 --> 01:06:43,573
- Come on grandpa.

1247
01:06:43,574 --> 01:06:45,966
When was the last time
you had a really nice haircut?

1248
01:06:45,967 --> 01:06:47,673
- What's wrong with my hair?

1249
01:06:47,674 --> 01:06:49,889
Besides, I don't
need anything fancy.

1250
01:06:49,890 --> 01:06:53,601
- What about a manicure
with a shave and a facial?

1251
01:06:53,602 --> 01:06:54,879
- A facial what?

1252
01:06:54,880 --> 01:06:56,444
- It feels good, trust me.

1253
01:06:56,445 --> 01:06:59,388
- Hey, you're never going
to guess what I just won?

1254
01:06:59,389 --> 01:07:01,228
- That salon must be desperate.

1255
01:07:01,229 --> 01:07:03,564
- Well, king for a day.

1256
01:07:03,565 --> 01:07:05,002
I like the way that sounds.

1257
01:07:05,003 --> 01:07:07,725
Not too sure about
this face thing though.

1258
01:07:07,726 --> 01:07:09,334
- You don't know about facials?

1259
01:07:09,335 --> 01:07:12,305
What, you've been
living under a rock?

1260
01:07:12,306 --> 01:07:14,337
- I'm willing to give it a try.

1261
01:07:14,338 --> 01:07:16,099
You'll try
anything if it's free.

1262
01:07:16,100 --> 01:07:17,670
- How about you two go together?

1263
01:07:17,671 --> 01:07:18,673
Tomorrow.

1264
01:07:18,674 --> 01:07:19,674
- Tomorrow?

1265
01:07:19,675 --> 01:07:20,845
- Oh what, no good?

1266
01:07:20,846 --> 01:07:23,508
You got a bank robbery
you have to foil or something?

1267
01:07:23,509 --> 01:07:25,265
- No, I was hoping
to spend it with Annie.

1268
01:07:25,266 --> 01:07:26,630
Not getting my legs waxed.

1269
01:07:26,631 --> 01:07:28,534
- It's only for a day,

1270
01:07:28,535 --> 01:07:30,035
and Ashley's here.

1271
01:07:31,979 --> 01:07:33,510
- Come on captain.

1272
01:07:33,511 --> 01:07:35,838
When's the last time
we got to be kings?

1273
01:07:35,839 --> 01:07:37,011
For free?

1274
01:07:37,012 --> 01:07:38,561
- You're right.

1275
01:07:38,562 --> 01:07:39,761
This could be good.

1276
01:07:39,762 --> 01:07:41,100
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1277
01:07:41,101 --> 01:07:42,156
- Look at this facial.

1278
01:07:42,157 --> 01:07:43,838
Pedicure, whatever that is.

1279
01:07:43,839 --> 01:07:45,596
Oh, that's feet I think.
- [Grandpa] Feet,

1280
01:07:45,597 --> 01:07:46,594
okay manicure.

1281
01:07:46,594 --> 01:07:47,591
It's gotta be for a man.

1282
01:07:47,592 --> 01:07:49,173
That's for a man.
- [Barney] We're men.

1283
01:07:49,174 --> 01:07:50,341
- [Grandpa] Yeah, okay, why not?

1284
01:07:50,342 --> 01:07:51,344
Massage.

1285
01:07:51,345 --> 01:07:54,448

1286
01:07:54,449 --> 01:07:57,032

1287
01:08:14,289 --> 01:08:17,039
(Engine humming)

1288
01:08:19,030 --> 01:08:20,202
- How'd it go?

1289
01:08:20,203 --> 01:08:21,205
- It's on.

1290
01:08:21,206 --> 01:08:22,370
- All right.

1291
01:08:22,371 --> 01:08:25,121
(Cheerful music)

1292
01:08:37,162 --> 01:08:38,329
Good gracious.

1293
01:08:41,738 --> 01:08:43,321
I mean, no problem.

1294
01:08:44,164 --> 01:08:46,212
- Ashley and I will
start in the back.

1295
01:08:46,213 --> 01:08:47,213
- Let's go.

1296
01:08:53,658 --> 01:08:56,386
(Loud thudding)

1297
01:08:56,387 --> 01:08:58,887
I guess I'll start right here.

1298
01:09:13,284 --> 01:09:17,284
- This doesn't make us,
you know, less than men?

1299
01:09:18,231 --> 01:09:19,649
- You know, why
doesn't our barbershop

1300
01:09:19,650 --> 01:09:21,733
ever have king for a day?

1301
01:09:23,057 --> 01:09:24,432
- Anybody looking?

1302
01:09:24,433 --> 01:09:26,400
- No, nobody I know anyway.

1303
01:09:26,401 --> 01:09:27,484
- One, two...

1304
01:09:29,273 --> 01:09:32,106
(Whimsical music)

1305
01:09:37,867 --> 01:09:39,376
- You must be Donald and Barney.

1306
01:09:39,377 --> 01:09:40,385
I'm Sonia.

1307
01:09:40,386 --> 01:09:41,473
This is my salon.

1308
01:09:41,474 --> 01:09:42,906
Welcome, you're right on time.

1309
01:09:42,907 --> 01:09:44,490

(Horn honking)

1316
01:10:29,323 --> 01:10:31,092
- Calvary's arrived!

1317
01:10:31,093 --> 01:10:34,555
Should have brought
in new recruits.

1318
01:10:34,556 --> 01:10:35,870
- Hey Lance.

1319
01:10:35,871 --> 01:10:38,396
Sonia drag you away
from your big concert tour?

1320
01:10:38,397 --> 01:10:39,580
- Oh, we made a deal.

1321
01:10:39,581 --> 01:10:42,252
I'm headlining the
midsummer festival.

1322
01:10:42,253 --> 01:10:43,841
Take this right.

1323
01:10:43,842 --> 01:10:45,717
- Thanks bud.

1324
01:10:45,718 --> 01:10:47,644
- He's a singer?

1325
01:10:47,645 --> 01:10:48,728

1326
01:10:54,525 --> 01:10:55,408

1328
01:11:00,998 --> 01:11:03,700
- Why don't you show Lance
where we keep the paintbrushes?

1329
01:11:03,701 --> 01:11:04,700
- Follow me.

1330
01:11:04,700 --> 01:11:05,700

1331

1358
01:12:59,546 --> 01:13:01,034

like a trip to Paris

1359
01:13:01,035 --> 01:13:02,952
without all the French.

1360
01:13:06,224 --> 01:13:07,891
Didn't we park here?

1361
01:13:11,739 --> 01:13:14,007

1362
01:13:14,008 --> 01:13:15,508
Have a nice life.

1363
01:13:17,846 --> 01:13:20,046
They're not going anywhere.

1364
01:13:20,047 --> 01:13:23,503
- You do know that
turtles aren't fast creatures.

1365
01:13:23,504 --> 01:13:24,504
- I know,

1366
01:13:25,827 --> 01:13:27,797
I just don't want
them to get hurt.

1367
01:13:27,798 --> 01:13:29,496
- Before George
and Gracie were living

1368
01:13:29,497 --> 01:13:30,810
in your grandpa's pool,

1369
01:13:30,811 --> 01:13:32,805
they were out here
surviving in the woods.

1370
01:13:32,806 --> 01:13:33,968

01:13:33,969 --> 01:13:36,158

1374
01:13:39,830 --> 01:13:41,693
- I've been most everywhere

1375
01:13:41,694 --> 01:13:44,502
but there's nowhere
I'd rather be.

1376
01:13:44,503 --> 01:13:45,766
- Awesome.

1377
01:13:45,767 --> 01:13:46,871
- Yeah, but that's
how he does it.

was going to do it,

1379
01:13:48,419 --> 01:13:49,252

roll hip hop kind, you know?

1384
01:13:55,307 --> 01:13:57,105
- That was a violation of music.

1385
01:13:57,106 --> 01:13:58,106
My music.

1386
01:14:00,636 --> 01:14:02,145
- That was one of your songs?

1387
01:14:02,146 --> 01:14:03,143
- Yeah.

1388
01:14:03,144 --> 01:14:08,143
But I like to think I sang it
a little bit better than that.

1389
01:14:08,807 --> 01:14:10,884
- Did you enjoy singing?

1390
01:14:10,885 --> 01:14:14,566
I mean years ago in
front of all those people?

1391
01:14:14,567 --> 01:14:16,166
- Yeah.

1392
01:14:16,167 --> 01:14:18,934
It was fun watching
the magic happen.

1393
01:14:18,935 --> 01:14:19,935
- Magic?

1394
01:14:20,684 --> 01:14:23,363
- You know, songs touch
us all in different ways,

1395
01:14:23,364 --> 01:14:24,871
young and old.

1396
01:14:24,872 --> 01:14:27,521
But when you can sing a
song that touches everybody

1397
01:14:27,522 --> 01:14:31,156
in the same way, it's a
wonderful thing to see.

1398
01:14:31,157 --> 01:14:33,407
- So then why did you stop?

1399
01:14:37,658 --> 01:14:38,658
- Well,

1400
01:14:39,473 --> 01:14:41,231
let's just say I
lost the desire.

1401
01:14:41,232 --> 01:14:44,649
Singing comes from
a very personal place.

1402
01:14:47,162 --> 01:14:48,730
Oh, we should be getting back.

1403
01:14:48,731 --> 01:14:51,231
We've got a lot of work to do.

1404
01:14:54,704 --> 01:14:55,841
- Mistake.

1405
01:14:55,842 --> 01:14:57,027
Is that your car?

1406
01:14:57,028 --> 01:14:59,801
- Yeah, but it was it parked
in front of Sonia's salon?

1407
01:14:59,802 --> 01:15:00,953
- Yeah but...

1408
01:15:00,954 --> 01:15:02,729
- Did you see the
no parking sign?

1409
01:15:02,730 --> 01:15:04,020
- Yeah, but...

1410
01:15:04,021 --> 01:15:05,595
- No mistake.

1411
01:15:05,596 --> 01:15:09,289
- Look fellow, do we
look like lawbreakers?

1412
01:15:09,290 --> 01:15:11,693
- Not with them fancy haircuts

1413
01:15:11,694 --> 01:15:13,527
and manicured fingers.

1414
01:15:14,627 --> 01:15:15,794
Sweet perfume.

1415
01:15:16,628 --> 01:15:18,926
Are y'all together?

1416
01:15:18,927 --> 01:15:20,494
- [Men] No!

1417
01:15:20,495 --> 01:15:22,358
- Y'all from California?

1418
01:15:22,359 --> 01:15:23,357
- No!

1419
01:15:23,358 --> 01:15:24,473
We're locals!

1420
01:15:24,474 --> 01:15:27,379
Look at the license plate.

1421
01:15:27,380 --> 01:15:28,662
- Those tags overdue?

1422
01:15:28,663 --> 01:15:31,326
- So what's it going to cost
me to get my car out of here?

1423
01:15:31,327 --> 01:15:34,158
- Well, you got
your service call.

1424
01:15:34,159 --> 01:15:35,433
Got your hook up.

1425
01:15:35,434 --> 01:15:36,674
Got the towing, of course.

1426
01:15:36,675 --> 01:15:39,508
There's storage
at an hourly rate.

1427
01:15:46,279 --> 01:15:47,673
Tell you what, on second thought

1428
01:15:47,674 --> 01:15:49,565
I think we're just
going to call it even.

1429
01:15:49,566 --> 01:15:51,309
I believe you people.

1430
01:15:51,310 --> 01:15:52,810
Be back in a jiff.

1431
01:15:55,619 --> 01:15:57,182
- You people?

1432
01:15:57,183 --> 01:16:01,016
I told you we shouldn't
have got the manicure.

1433
01:16:04,119 --> 01:16:05,590
- No, no, no you
can't go out that way.

1434
01:16:05,591 --> 01:16:07,424
The paint's still wet.

1435
01:16:13,849 --> 01:16:16,967
(Phone ringing)

1436
01:16:16,968 --> 01:16:18,311
- Hello?

1437
01:16:18,312 --> 01:16:19,563
- They're on their way.

1438
01:16:19,564 --> 01:16:20,712
- [Sonia] No, you
gotta stall them.

1439
01:16:20,713 --> 01:16:21,711
We're not finished yet.

1440
01:16:21,712 --> 01:16:23,271
- I'd be more than happy to.

1441
01:16:23,272 --> 01:16:26,667
As long as Reed gets
top billing on your show.

1442
01:16:26,668 --> 01:16:28,168
- Okay deal, deal!

1443
01:16:29,877 --> 01:16:31,592
Lance you just got bumped.

1444
01:16:31,593 --> 01:16:32,593
Everybody!

1445
01:16:33,720 --> 01:16:36,236
Okay look, your
grandpa's on the way back.

1446
01:16:36,237 --> 01:16:38,071
We've got to get
this place finished up.

1447
01:16:38,072 --> 01:16:39,143
Come on, hop to it!

1448
01:16:39,144 --> 01:16:40,207
Let's get this mopped.

1449
01:16:40,208 --> 01:16:41,521
Ashley, get the broom,

1450
01:16:41,522 --> 01:16:43,086
come on!

1451
01:16:43,087 --> 01:16:44,087
- Bravo two.

1452
01:16:45,152 --> 01:16:46,155
- [Reed] Reed here.

1453
01:16:46,156 --> 01:16:49,077
- Reed, got good news for you,

1454
01:16:49,078 --> 01:16:50,283
but I'm going to ask you to do

1455
01:16:50,284 --> 01:16:53,127
a little something for me first.

1456
01:16:53,128 --> 01:16:54,227
- [Grandpa] Have
I been drinking?

1457
01:16:54,228 --> 01:16:56,159
- I noticed you swerving
the last quarter mile.

1458
01:16:56,160 --> 01:16:58,320
- That's this car, officer.

1459
01:16:58,321 --> 01:17:00,027
It's overdue for inspection.

1460
01:17:00,028 --> 01:17:02,225
- Sir, I'm gonna have
to ask you to step

1461
01:17:02,226 --> 01:17:04,103
outside the vehicle.

1462
01:17:04,104 --> 01:17:06,937
- Oh no, he has
not been drinking.

1463
01:17:08,267 --> 01:17:09,813
- [Grandpa] Oh shut up!

1464
01:17:09,814 --> 01:17:11,887
- [Barney] Really,
he hasn't been.

1465
01:17:11,888 --> 01:17:13,672
- [Grandpa] Don't make it worse.

1466
01:17:13,673 --> 01:17:14,873
- Feet together, please.

1467
01:17:14,874 --> 01:17:15,874
Arms out.

1468
01:17:16,713 --> 01:17:19,963
(Cheerful piano music)

1469
01:17:43,271 --> 01:17:44,890
- [Father] Carol,
just settle down.

1470
01:17:44,891 --> 01:17:48,384
I'm sure there's a
perfectly logical explana...

1471
01:17:48,385 --> 01:17:49,385
Wow.

1472
01:17:56,985 --> 01:17:59,568
- [Carol] What's going on here?

1473
01:18:02,949 --> 01:18:05,144
(Gasping)

1474
01:18:05,145 --> 01:18:06,312
- Who are you?

1475
01:18:07,860 --> 01:18:08,860
- [Carol] Who are you people?

1476
01:18:08,861 --> 01:18:10,583
Where's my dad?

1477
01:18:10,584 --> 01:18:11,649
- Now just wait right there.

1478
01:18:11,650 --> 01:18:12,733
Honey, call the police.

1479
01:18:12,734 --> 01:18:13,732
- Wait, wait, wait!

1480
01:18:13,733 --> 01:18:14,737
It's okay!

1481
01:18:14,738 --> 01:18:16,268
- Hang on here,
hang on, hang on.

1482
01:18:16,269 --> 01:18:17,925
- No need for that.

1483
01:18:17,926 --> 01:18:19,768
- [Greg] There is no
reason to call the police.

1484
01:18:19,769 --> 01:18:21,119
- Boy what a day.

1485
01:18:21,120 --> 01:18:22,119
- Yep.

1486
01:18:22,120 --> 01:18:23,580
- I can't wait to get
home and relax.

1487
01:18:23,581 --> 01:18:25,053
Get some peace and quiet.

1488
01:18:25,054 --> 01:18:28,151
- Yeah, you can say
that again, captain.

1489
01:18:28,152 --> 01:18:29,152
Uh oh.

1490
01:18:35,339 --> 01:18:36,489
(Doors slamming)

1491
01:18:36,490 --> 01:18:37,977
- Where have you been?

1492
01:18:37,978 --> 01:18:40,343
- We were getting facials.

1493
01:18:40,344 --> 01:18:41,806
- Excuse me?

1494
01:18:41,807 --> 01:18:42,807
- Uh oh.

1495
01:18:44,143 --> 01:18:45,326
- What's going on here.

1496
01:18:45,327 --> 01:18:46,772
What have you done to my house?

1497
01:18:46,773 --> 01:18:48,940
- We're friends of Lauren.

1498
01:18:51,572 --> 01:18:53,415
(Slow music)

1499
01:18:53,416 --> 01:18:54,583
I mean, Annie.

1500
01:18:59,579 --> 01:19:00,579
Excuse me.

1501
01:19:04,907 --> 01:19:05,907
- Greg?

1502
01:19:18,168 --> 01:19:19,168
Surprise.

1503
01:19:22,566 --> 01:19:24,747
- Honey, you know if
you wanted to help out,

1504
01:19:24,748 --> 01:19:26,300
if you wanted to
arrange of cleanup day,

1505
01:19:26,301 --> 01:19:27,302
you should have told us.

1506
01:19:27,303 --> 01:19:28,136
We're your family, you know,

1507
01:19:28,137 --> 01:19:30,810
we don't keep secrets
from each other.

1508
01:19:30,811 --> 01:19:32,009
- Sure as heck don't lie.

1509
01:19:32,010 --> 01:19:35,010
That's not the
daughter I am raising

1510
01:19:39,625 --> 01:19:40,875
- no more lies.

1511
01:19:41,903 --> 01:19:43,236
No more secrets.

1512
01:19:44,165 --> 01:19:46,582
(Slow music)

1513
01:20:09,496 --> 01:20:12,329
(Pebbles popping)

1514
01:20:23,937 --> 01:20:26,282
- Wow, they sure
fixed a lot of things.

1515
01:20:26,283 --> 01:20:28,010
- Oh, everything's fixed.

1516
01:20:28,011 --> 01:20:30,400
Except me, according to you.

1517
01:20:30,401 --> 01:20:32,816
- Dad, can we
just talk about this?

1518
01:20:32,817 --> 01:20:34,223
- Will it matter?

1519
01:20:34,224 --> 01:20:36,208
You've already
made up your mind.

1520
01:20:36,209 --> 01:20:37,738
You could've told me anytime.

1521
01:20:37,739 --> 01:20:38,737
I've been around.

1522
01:20:38,738 --> 01:20:40,382
- No you haven't been around.

1523
01:20:40,383 --> 01:20:42,610
Never been around for me.

1524
01:20:42,611 --> 01:20:44,357
- Oh, so that's it.

1525
01:20:44,358 --> 01:20:47,057
So this is about getting
even with me, revenge?

1526
01:20:47,058 --> 01:20:48,439
- Will you stop it?

1527
01:20:48,440 --> 01:20:49,441
I worry.

1528
01:20:49,442 --> 01:20:51,070
I always worried.

1529
01:20:51,071 --> 01:20:52,074
When mom was sick

1530
01:20:52,075 --> 01:20:54,406
I'm the one who had to
take care of everything.

1531
01:20:54,407 --> 01:20:55,441
You were always gone.

1532
01:20:55,442 --> 01:20:56,899
You were always away.

1533
01:20:56,900 --> 01:20:57,898
- I was working.

1534
01:20:57,899 --> 01:20:59,003
I was traveling.

1535
01:20:59,004 --> 01:21:01,240
I was supporting
you and your mom.

1536
01:21:01,241 --> 01:21:02,866
What did you want me to do?

1537
01:21:02,867 --> 01:21:04,300
- I wanted you to tuck me in!

1538
01:21:04,301 --> 01:21:05,572
I wanted you to help
me with my homework!

1539
01:21:05,573 --> 01:21:08,499
I wanted you to tell me
I was pretty at the prom.

1540
01:21:08,500 --> 01:21:10,098
I just,

1541
01:21:10,099 --> 01:21:13,266
I just wanted you
to tell me you felt.

1542
01:21:17,752 --> 01:21:18,796
- I had those feelings.

1543
01:21:18,797 --> 01:21:19,797
I just,

1544
01:21:20,859 --> 01:21:22,743
it's different now.

1545
01:21:22,744 --> 01:21:24,753
Annie is just like you.

1546
01:21:24,754 --> 01:21:27,587
Maybe parents
get better with age.

1547
01:21:33,853 --> 01:21:35,617
- Not for me.

1548
01:21:35,618 --> 01:21:37,785
Just keeps getting harder.

1549
01:21:39,256 --> 01:21:42,423
- That's because you're
holding on too tight.

1550
01:21:42,424 --> 01:21:44,007
Annie's a good kid.

1551
01:21:45,048 --> 01:21:48,924
Just need to loosen
the reins a little.

1552
01:21:48,925 --> 01:21:50,087
- I'm afraid if I let go,

1553
01:21:50,088 --> 01:21:52,421
she won't want to come back.

1554
01:21:53,657 --> 01:21:54,922
- The person who did all this

1555
01:21:54,923 --> 01:21:57,006
isn't trying to run away.

1556
01:21:59,382 --> 01:22:01,715
- Yeah, pretty amazing, huh?

1557
01:22:05,148 --> 01:22:08,648
- It's a lot nicer than
a retirement home.

1558
01:22:12,305 --> 01:22:14,555
I'm not ready for that.

1559
01:22:14,556 --> 01:22:18,389
There's still some
life in this old skiff yet.

1560
01:22:19,884 --> 01:22:20,884
- I know.

1561
01:22:23,750 --> 01:22:25,931
Maybe we could
stay in touch more?

1562
01:22:25,932 --> 01:22:28,515
Talk once a week on the phone?

1563
01:22:31,297 --> 01:22:34,297
- What's New York
like at Christmas?

1564
01:22:44,168 --> 01:22:46,093
- Can you wait up a minute?

1565
01:22:46,094 --> 01:22:48,511
- I'll be chilling over here.

1566
01:23:05,727 --> 01:23:07,351
- Annie, I just don't
think it's a good idea

1567
01:23:07,352 --> 01:23:10,176
for you to come
around here anymore.

1568
01:23:10,177 --> 01:23:13,808
- Look, I just want to
apologize for today,

1569
01:23:13,809 --> 01:23:14,892
to Sonia too.

1570
01:23:16,312 --> 01:23:18,924
- You don't have
anything to be sorry for.

1571
01:23:18,925 --> 01:23:21,107
- Except for the way
my parents treated you.

1572
01:23:21,108 --> 01:23:24,352
- Well, someday you'll
understand what that's all about.

1573
01:23:24,353 --> 01:23:26,128
- You should know
how much I appreciate

1574
01:23:26,129 --> 01:23:27,796
what you did for me.

1575
01:23:28,967 --> 01:23:31,664
- You mean what I
did for your grandpa?

1576
01:23:31,665 --> 01:23:32,665
- No, me.

1577
01:23:44,975 --> 01:23:48,558
Your daughter's not
around anymore, is she?

1578
01:23:58,702 --> 01:23:59,656
- No.

1579
01:23:59,657 --> 01:24:02,073
(Slow music)

1580
01:24:03,245 --> 01:24:04,245
She died.

1581
01:24:06,261 --> 01:24:09,280
My wife and beautiful
little daughter, Lauren,

1582
01:24:09,281 --> 01:24:14,156
were killed by a drunk
driver almost five years ago.

1583
01:24:14,157 --> 01:24:17,143
- That's why you
stopped singing.

1584
01:24:17,144 --> 01:24:20,227
- So much of what
I used to do and be

1585
01:24:21,597 --> 01:24:23,264
was because of them.

1586
01:24:24,216 --> 01:24:27,079
It'll just never be the same.

1587
01:24:27,080 --> 01:24:28,747
- Does it has to be?

1588
01:24:30,232 --> 01:24:33,244
Grandpa never thinks
about the bad times

1589
01:24:33,245 --> 01:24:34,912
he had with grandma.

1590
01:24:36,077 --> 01:24:37,074
But he keeps her spirit alive

1591
01:24:37,075 --> 01:24:39,657
by remembering the good things.

1592
01:24:42,845 --> 01:24:46,927
- All those good things
were a part of my music.

1593
01:24:46,928 --> 01:24:50,951
- Maybe that's the best
way to remember then.

1594
01:24:50,952 --> 01:24:53,780
Share your music with others.

1595
01:24:53,781 --> 01:24:56,781
That's where the
magic is, remember?

1596
01:25:04,478 --> 01:25:07,478
This guy knew how
to make magic too.

1597
01:25:13,938 --> 01:25:16,395
Good luck, Greg Russell.

1598
01:25:16,396 --> 01:25:18,229
I'll never forget you.

1599
01:25:40,214 --> 01:25:43,635
I had something
that I had to do.

1600
01:25:43,636 --> 01:25:44,636
- Okay.

1601
01:25:45,738 --> 01:25:49,391
- You'll just have to
add it to my jail term.

1602
01:25:49,392 --> 01:25:53,049
With good behavior
I'll be out in three years.

1603
01:25:53,050 --> 01:25:56,791
- Maybe I'm the one
that should be grounded.

1604
01:25:56,792 --> 01:25:57,959
Nice wardrobe.

1605
01:25:59,124 --> 01:26:03,895
I would have liked to have
gone shopping with you.

1606
01:26:03,896 --> 01:26:06,531
Look, if you want
to tell me something

1607
01:26:06,532 --> 01:26:09,527
or share your life with me,

1608
01:26:09,528 --> 01:26:10,528
I'm here.

1609
01:26:11,545 --> 01:26:14,295
- Then I'll always
be in trouble.

1610
01:26:15,172 --> 01:26:17,255
- I'll try to lighten up.

1611
01:26:18,442 --> 01:26:22,692
But it doesn't mean it's
okay for you to sneak out.

1612
01:26:23,759 --> 01:26:27,289
We have to find
