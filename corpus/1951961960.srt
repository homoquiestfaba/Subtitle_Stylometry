00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:27,309
Oh, I was... er...
I was invited... here by a friend.

173
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:30,557
- Through the service door?
- Right... er...

174
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:33,148
- Can I see your ID?
- Yeah, of course...

175
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:38,712
- I'm really sorry about this.
- That's OK.

176
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:42,150
Lauryn Kirk from Glenwood, Indiana.

177
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:44,589
"Corn and cars", that's our motto.

178
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:46,119
I like corn.

179
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:48,674
Actually if you just give me
your phone number,

180
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:52,156
we can settle this,
and it's kind of a house rule...

181
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:54,032
- Hey, you made it.
- Hey.

182
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:56,355
- Is this guy giving you a hard time?
- No!

183
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:59,111
But I thought he was the manager.

184
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:01,800
The manager?
No, Russ is the music director.

185
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:03,512
Guilty.

186
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:07,877
- Nice try.
- Well, it almost worked.

187
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,197
Sort that out later.
I wanna introduce you to Brenda.

188
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:12,958
Bye, Lauryn Kirk!

189
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:22,479
Brenda, this is Lauryn and vice versa.

190
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:26,070
You've been looking for her,
for the bookkeeping job.

191
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:28,634
Thanks, but I'm not adopting
any more strays.

192
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:31,877
I need you upstairs getting ready.

193
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,070
Wait, wait.

194
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:38,714
I know you don't want a stranger
looking into your books,

195
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:41,877
but I know QuickBooks,
I can do payroll in my sleep,

196
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,197
and your quarterly 1087
is due in seven days.

197
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:49,074
If you pay your crew in cash, you'll need
a perfect Schedule E to avoid enquiries.

198
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:53,034
I've cranked those out like clockwork for
my family's business since I was 17.

199
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:56,914
But if you just need me to file stuff,
I can do that, too.

200
00:16:57,040 --> 00:17:00,032
- You done?
- Yeah.

201
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:03,277
Fine. Trial basis, $12 an hour,
and no benefits.

202
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:04,799
OK.

203
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:13,233
(Brenda) This is where the girls change.
This is your home away from home.

204
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:16,352
You get paid every other week.

205
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:19,199
You'll start at 3:00
and stay till we close.

206
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:23,359
If you can't find something, look harder.
It's all in here somewhere.

207
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:26,191
You can start...

208
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:30,437
...by organising the January receipts.

209
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:32,152
No problem.

210
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:36,034

lasted about a week.

- Every night we're open.

00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:26,235
Brenda's got a real vision for the place.

241
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:30,035
It's rooted in burlesque, but our dance
goes way beyond the traditional stuff.

242
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:33,277
- Well, you were terrific up there.
- Thanks.

Aw, well, welcome to Chicago.
Congratulations on the new job.

259
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:35,676
Cool about earlier?
Cos I was just playing.

260
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:39,872
- So how long you worked at Ruby's?
- About a year.

261
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:43,996
- You like it?
- There's worse ways to make a living.

262
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:46,315
I'll bet there are.

263
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:05,791
- Why aren't you out there?
- Not my kind of dancing.

264
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:10,311
Sitting back, hiding in your hoodie...
That's your kind of dancing?

265
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:15,555
So... er... you and Carmen?

266
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:17,511
No. No.

267
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:20,279
That was like a 24-hour flu.

268
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:24,552
You get it, you get really sick,
and then you get over it.

269
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:36,872
So arrogant. "Are you just hide
out there in your hoodie?"

270
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:41,949
Russ likes giving people a hard time,
especially if he thinks they're cute.

Please.

272
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:47,078
Russ was right.
You should've been on the floor with us.

273
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:49,953

Seriously, you're missing another side
you could bring to your dancing.

I'm not dancing right now, remember?

278
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:25,394
Hey, you're looking good.

279
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:30,319
Why do my feet hate me?

280
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:34,035
I don't know. Maybe it's cos
you're going from the twist into a step.

281
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:36,071
Like you're missing something.

282
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:39,112
- Right. I'll just eighty-six the combo.
- No, it's...

283
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:44,519
No, I think the combination's fine.
It's just I think you're missing a piece.

284
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:47,029
Like, if it was my thing

285
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:51,836
and I wanted to do that
I would just go... here to there.

286

Could you show me that again?

287
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:56,353

340
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:34,669
unless you know you're the only one
with a set of keys.

341
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:39,959
Thanks, I'll try to remember that.

342
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:42,759
You know, er...

343
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:46,872
Think I could pry you away?
Maybe grab a drink?

344
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:50,675
Not real thirsty.

345
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:54,159
Cool.

346
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:58,237
Cool. Er... next time.

347
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:01,759
I could eat.

348
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:07,151
Well, I got the perfect place.

349
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:15,671
Growing up, my mom used
to tell me stories about Chicago,

350
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:19,156
the lights, energy, the people.

351
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:22,033
She dreamed of coming here
and being a dancer.

352
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:25,869
- That's where you got the moves from.
- Yep. She studied to be one.

353
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:30,357
Chose to be a mom instead.
So she passed the dream down to me.

354
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:33,552
- Is she still in Glenwood?
- No, no. She passed away.

355
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:37,995
I'm sorry.

356
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:41,635
She got pretty sick when I was about 10,

357
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:45,070
and it took a lot out of us,
especially my dad.

358
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:49,352
After Mom, he just...
spent all his time in the garage.

359
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:52,793
He said it kept his mind off missing her.

360
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:57,228
And then one night, three years ago,

361
00:33:57,360 --> 00:34:00,272
I was coming back to the garage
after a recital.

362
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:04,552
Joel was in Indy picking up equipment
and he'd asked me to stay with Dad.

363
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:08,673
But some dancer friends
wanted to go out to dinner.

364
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:11,360
Later when I did get to the garage...

365
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:15,354
...I found him on the floor.

366
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:17,914
He'd had a heart attack.

367
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,639
I always wonder if I'd just got there
10 minutes earlier...

368
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:25,558
You can't do that to yourself.

369
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:31,914
After that, I put school on hold
to stay and help Joel out with the shop.

370
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:35,555
Since losing Dad,
it's just been the two of us.

371
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:39,554
That had to be hard.

372
00:34:39,680 --> 00:34:41,750
You know, all of it.

373
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:43,279
Yeah.

374
00:34:45,080 --> 00:34:46,593
(Sighs)

375
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:48,676
So what's in there?

376
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:52,270
This? This is the best
sweet and sour shrimp in Chicago.

377
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:53,879
- Really?
- Want some?

378
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,433
Sure.

379
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:02,910
Yeah, that's Lincoln Park,

380
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:06,828
where all the kids hang out
with the students and what not.

381
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:09,428
Then you got downtown,
where the bankers are.

382
00:35:09,560 --> 00:35:11,915
That's pretty much Chicago.

383
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:14,879
Well...

384
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:18,996
Thank you for a wonderful dinner.

385
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:20,519
Anytime.

386
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:27,918
I don't remember seeing that
on the menu.

387
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:31,237
Yeah, well, that's the Chef's Special.

388
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:35,958
Good night.

389
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:37,672
Good night.

390
00:35:53,720 --> 00:35:56,632
- Hey.
- Hi.

391
00:35:56,760 --> 00:35:58,830
- How's it going?
- Good.

392
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:03,194
So I had a good time last night.

393
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:04,719
Me, too.

394
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:08,435
You have got to be kidding me.
Carmen's running late.

395
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:10,949
Doesn't Dana go on first anyway?

396
00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:14,197
Do you see Dana?
No, because she called in sick.

397
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:17,278
- And I have a line...
- I can spin till Carmen gets here.

398
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:20,233
I have three birthday parties
and a room full of VIPs.

399
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:23,830
No offence, Russ,
but they didn't come to hear you spin.

400
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:26,918
- You could let Lauryn dance.
- What?

401
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:29,838
Brenda, I've seen her dance,
OK, she's good.

402
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:33,236
Why don't you just give her a shot?

403
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:38,229
Look, Lauryn, you're a sweet kid,
but you're obviously no dancer.

404
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:42,752
Why did you tell her that?

405
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:45,110
What, you're gonna hide out
back here?

406
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:47,390
What you saw me doing
was fooling around.

407
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:50,796
- I don't dance like Ruby's girls.
- So do your thing.

408
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:54,117
Trust me, when you get on stage,
nobody's gonna care.

409
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:55,798
Well, I care.

410
00:36:57,480 --> 00:36:59,630
You moved to Chicago to be a dancer.

411
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:02,638
I moved here to go to school.

412
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:05,598
OK.

413
00:37:05,720 --> 00:37:07,312
I'm sorry.

414
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:13,075
(Brenda) Look, price doesn't matter
as long as you get her here.

415
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:14,758
Yes, a cab.

416
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:20,075
How long? All right.
Thanks, I'll give them a try.

417
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:28,315
Joe, it's Brenda,
I need a girl right away.

418
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:30,032

00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,718

I'd say you rehearsed for tonight.

(Russ) Really?
You grew up around a garage?

439
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:38,710
(Lauryn) Yeah, I know
my way around a car.

440

- I'd like to see you as a grease monkey.
- Oh, yeah.

keeping me in that shop.

- Well, he's just a protective brother.
- A little too protective.

443
00:40:51,360 --> 00:40:56,275
He doesn't want me to get my hopes up,
so he means well, I guess.

444
00:40:57,720 --> 00:41:01,872
- This is really impressive.
- It's my entire life, right here.

- Mm-hm.

00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:09,555
Yeah, I gotta admit something
that's been bothering me for a while.

447
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:11,750
What's that?

448
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:13,472
I lied.

449
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:17,679
When I said I liked corn,
that was a blatant lie.

450
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:20,234
I actually hate corn.

00:41:20,360 --> 00:41:24,478
Wow. I feel betrayed, like I don't
even know you any more...

00:46:52,240 --> 00:46:55,516
to the newest addition
to the family... Lauryn!

510
00:46:55,640 --> 00:46:57,437
(Cheering)

511
00:46:57,560 --> 00:46:59,994
(# Unkle Jam: "Love Ya")

512
00:48:14,720 --> 00:48:17,029
Like you said, girl's got moves.

513
00:48:59,640 --> 00:49:03,474
So... er... this school
you auditioned for,

514
00:49:03,600 --> 00:49:06,672
did they say anything, you know,
like why you didn't get in?

515
00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:09,075
Sort of, I guess.

516
00:49:09,200 --> 00:49:11,270
Can I be honest with you?

517
00:49:11,400 --> 00:49:14,233
I think whoever made that decision
is nuts.

518
00:49:16,720 --> 00:49:20,679
OK, the director of the dance
department didn't like my routine.

519
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:22,836
He said he thought it wasn't...

520
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:25,952
sensual or feminine enough
or something like that.

521
00:49:26,080 --> 00:49:29,311
Let's wrestle him into Ruby's one night
and prove him wrong.

522
00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:32,477
I don't think he's looking
for Ruby's kind of dancers.

523
00:49:32,600 --> 00:49:35,068
This guy can't have final say
in your life.

524
00:49:35,200 --> 00:49:39,716
Well, no offence, but he is
a world-renowned choreographer,

525
00:49:39,840 --> 00:49:44,311
so I think he knows a little bit more
about dance than me and you.

526
00:49:44,440 --> 00:49:46,908
Well, I know what I see and...

527
00:49:47,040 --> 00:49:50,919
...I see that you could be as sexy
as Carmen if you wanted to be.

528
00:49:51,040 --> 00:49:53,270
Oh, really?

529
00:49:53,400 --> 00:49:55,231
You know what, Russ?

530
00:49:55,360 --> 00:49:58,909
My life's goal isn't
to be as sexy as Carmen.

531
00:49:59,040 --> 00:50:02,635
- Hey... I'm sorry, that came out wrong.
- Oh, you think?

532
00:50:02,760 --> 00:50:06,309
Yeah. This isn't about Carmen,
this is about you.

533
00:50:07,480 --> 00:50:10,392
You can mix it up better
than any of those girls at Ruby's,

534
00:50:10,520 --> 00:50:12,511
and trust me, I've seen 'em all.

535
00:50:12,640 --> 00:50:15,791
And you have the potential
to go so much further.

536
00:50:15,920 --> 00:50:17,911
That's all I was trying to say.

537
00:50:22,040 --> 00:50:23,951
What?

538
00:50:26,640 --> 00:50:28,392
Come on.

539
00:50:29,680 --> 00:50:32,877
Ow! You know, you're kind of cute
when you're mad.

540
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:35,514
- I'm not talking to you.
- I'm just saying.

541
00:50:35,640 --> 00:50:36,868
Shut up!

542
00:51:26,640 --> 00:51:28,312
Mom...

543
00:51:36,880 --> 00:51:38,598
Hey.

544
00:51:38,720 --> 00:51:40,233
Hey.

545
00:51:40,360 --> 00:51:44,399
Your routine felt a little off tonight.
Something on your mind?

546
00:51:45,320 --> 00:51:48,949
Just... some stuff from back home,
I guess.

547
00:51:53,360 --> 00:51:57,831
My favourite teacher once told me...
dance is a window to the soul.

548
00:51:59,040 --> 00:52:01,235
It doesn't let you hide.

549
00:52:03,320 --> 00:52:05,880
But if you always fight what you feel,

550
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:10,596
you'll never tap into what could
make you not just a good dancer

551
00:52:10,720 --> 00:52:12,233
but a great one.

552
00:52:14,920 --> 00:52:16,319
Yeah.

553
00:52:21,840 --> 00:52:23,717
Lock up when you leave, OK?

554
00:52:23,840 --> 00:52:25,239
OK.

555
00:54:05,280 --> 00:54:07,316
(# KEKE PALMER: "Bottoms Up")

00:55:19,320 --> 00:55:20,753
Coming.

568
00:55:30,920 --> 00:55:32,751
Is something wrong?

569
00:55:32,880 --> 00:55:34,711
No, not at all.

570
00:55:34,840 --> 00:55:37,229
You just look amazing. Come on in.

571
00:55:45,360 --> 00:55:47,351
You are a closet romantic.

572
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:51,753
Well, I've been called worse.

573
00:55:55,280 --> 00:55:56,599
Shall we?

574
00:56:01,800 --> 00:56:03,438
Wait. Let me.

575
00:56:05,880 --> 00:56:08,235
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

576
00:56:11,360 --> 00:56:14,989
- May I offer you some wine?
- Yes, please.

577
00:56:17,800 --> 00:56:19,233
Thank you.

578
00:56:19,360 --> 00:56:20,759
(Sizzling)

579
00:56:20,880 --> 00:56:25,635
Oh, no. I gotta check the oven.
I'll be right back.

580
00:56:34,760 --> 00:56:37,035
How about a take-out?

581
00:56:38,240 --> 00:56:39,832
I don't know, it's like...

582
00:56:39,960 --> 00:56:42,952
...as long as the shop is alive,
a little piece of my parents is, too.

583
00:56:43,080 --> 00:56:46,356
So, it would kill me
if Joel ever closed it.

584
00:56:46,480 --> 00:56:50,553
- You two sound close.
- We've had our moments.

585
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:54,309
So I wanted to thank you
for the other night.

586
00:56:54,440 --> 00:56:55,839
For what?

587
00:56:56,520 --> 00:56:58,238
You were right.

588
00:56:58,360 --> 00:57:01,511
I can't let somebody I've met once
decide what I want.

589
00:57:01,640 --> 00:57:06,395
So I did some research... and...

590
00:57:06,520 --> 00:57:10,957
...the School of Music and Dance usually
accepts 20 applicants in a school year.

591
00:57:12,200 --> 00:57:14,350
But this year only 18 qualified.

592
00:57:14,480 --> 00:57:17,472
So they're holding
a second round of auditions

593
00:57:17,600 --> 00:57:20,797
for the next semester
to find their remaining two dancers.

594
00:57:20,920 --> 00:57:22,672
You're gonna re-audition?

595
00:57:22,800 --> 00:57:26,554
I think so. In three weeks.

596
00:57:26,680 --> 00:57:29,478
...the problem was the record company
got in my business,

597
00:57:29,600 --> 00:57:31,875
trying to tell me how to do it,
you know.

598
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:34,195
I thought I knew better, so...

599
00:57:35,840 --> 00:57:38,195
...so I walked away.

600
00:57:38,320 --> 00:57:41,915
- Just like that?
- Just like that.

601
00:57:42,040 --> 00:57:44,508
I backed out of the deal and...

602
00:57:45,240 --> 00:57:48,835
...fell in with the wrong crowd,
and... er...

603
00:57:48,960 --> 00:57:51,349
...and... er... you know?

604
00:57:51,480 --> 00:57:54,756
Eventually, I ended up at Ruby's,

605
00:57:54,880 --> 00:57:57,155
and I straightened myself out.

606
00:57:58,640 --> 00:58:00,710
See, here's the thing.

607
00:58:03,320 --> 00:58:07,916
See, everybody who walks away
from a dream has a reason.

608
00:58:10,280 --> 00:58:12,271
I think it's brave...

609
00:58:13,520 --> 00:58:16,193
...to take another shot.

610
00:58:19,680 --> 00:58:24,435
Sometimes I just feel like
I'm doing it all wrong.

611
00:58:24,560 --> 00:58:26,551
Well, you're not.

612
00:58:58,400 --> 00:59:00,436
# Listen to me...

613
00:59:00,560 --> 00:59:03,074
(# JAMELIA: "Beware Of The Dog")

614
00:59:25,800 --> 00:59:28,109

620
01:01:20,520 --> 01:01:22,431
Joel, stop!

621
01:01:22,560 --> 01:01:23,959
Wait!

622
01:01:24,560 --> 01:01:27,552
- Could you put some clothes on?
- What are you doing here?

623
01:01:27,680 --> 01:01:29,955
I came to congratulate you
on getting into the school,

624
01:01:30,080 --> 01:01:32,389
only they've never heard
of a Lauryn Kirk.

625
01:01:32,520 --> 01:01:34,351
You call this chasing your dreams?

626
01:01:34,480 --> 01:01:36,914
Is this all the hard work
you've been doing?

627
01:01:38,080 --> 01:01:42,119
I didn't get in.
I didn't know how to tell you.

628
01:01:42,240 --> 01:01:45,789
But if you'd stuck around,
you'd see how difficult the routines are.

629
01:01:45,920 --> 01:01:48,718
- I saw enough.
- Why don't you listen for a change?

630
01:01:48,840 --> 01:01:51,638
I'm on the verge of losing the shop,
and I drove six hours for this.

631
01:01:51,760 --> 01:01:54,877
- What do you mean?
- I have to sell or the bank'll foreclose.

632
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:56,797
- I can't make the payments.
- What?

633
01:01:56,920 --> 01:01:59,354
- Equipment, leases, everything.
- Why didn't you tell me?

634
01:01:59,480 --> 01:02:01,391
Why would you care?

635
01:02:01,520 --> 01:02:05,149
You're a big city girl now,
you're a dancer.

636
01:02:05,280 --> 01:02:07,669
Why have you always had
a problem with me dancing?

637
01:02:07,800 --> 01:02:10,394
You think the world revolves around you,
you always have!

638
01:02:10,520 --> 01:02:14,798
How dare you? I put my life on hold
for three years, Joel!

639
01:02:14,920 --> 01:02:19,550
And you put Dad on hold that night!
You should've been there, Lauryn!

640
01:02:27,520 --> 01:02:29,511
Hey, you OK?

641
01:02:37,320 --> 01:02:39,914
Maybe he was upset
because you were so bad.

642
01:02:40,040 --> 01:02:42,952
Ease off, Carmen. She was killing it.

643
01:02:43,080 --> 01:02:46,550
He drives hours to get here, then
has her embarrass the family name.

644
01:02:46,680 --> 01:02:49,831
- Hey, hey, stop, stop.
- (Lauryn) I'm sick of your shit.

645
01:02:49,960 --> 01:02:52,315
Enough!

646
01:02:52,440 --> 01:02:54,749
You happy, Carmen?

647
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:57,399
God, girl.

648
01:03:03,520 --> 01:03:08,036
Lauryn! Lauryn, wait!
She's just trying to get in your head.

649
01:03:08,160 --> 01:03:10,833
She can get in line cos there's
enough going on in there already.

650
01:03:10,960 --> 01:03:12,951
Hey, come on.

651
01:03:13,080 --> 01:03:16,868
I know that this was a lot,
but he knows now.

652
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:20,436
- You don't have to lie any more.
- What if he's right?

653
01:03:20,560 --> 01:03:23,358
All my life my family gave up
so much for me.

654
01:03:24,480 --> 01:03:26,277
What if I'm selfish?

655
01:03:26,400 --> 01:03:30,109
What are you going to do,
you just going to quit dancing?

656
01:03:30,240 --> 01:03:34,597
- Gonna quit living your life?
- Joel's the only family I have.

657
01:03:34,720 --> 01:03:36,711
I shouldn't be here
chasing some stupid dream.

658
01:03:36,840 --> 01:03:39,559
I should be home helping him.

659
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:45,437
- I'm sorry, I have to go.
- Who do you think you're fooling?

660
01:03:45,560 --> 01:03:49,473
I know you're going home
because you're scared of that audition.

661
01:03:49,600 --> 01:03:50,874
What?

662
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:54,629
If this was about your brother,
you'd have told him before tonight.

663
01:03:54,760 --> 01:03:56,079
What are you talking about?

664
01:03:56,200 --> 01:03:59,670
I know that you're running
because you're scared and that's it.

665
01:03:59,800 --> 01:04:03,634
I'm sorry if it shocks you that I'd help
my family out in a time of crisis,

666
01:04:03,760 --> 01:04:06,672
but that's how we do things
where I come from.

667
01:04:06,800 --> 01:04:11,191
Lauryn, come on.
Lauryn, you're making a big mistake.

668
01:04:16,480 --> 01:04:17,879
Lauryn!

669
01:04:41,080 --> 01:04:43,719
What are you doing here?

670
01:04:45,160 --> 01:04:47,720
I found two new wholesalers
we can use.

671
01:04:47,840 --> 01:04:52,868
- That should catch us up half-way.
- Wait, just slow down for a second.

672
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:56,356
- Are you back here to work?
- I'm not gonna let you sell.

673
01:04:56,480 --> 01:04:59,153
We can catch up.

674
01:04:59,280 --> 01:05:02,716
Look, I...
said some things I didn't mean.

675
01:05:03,760 --> 01:05:05,398
I know.

676
01:05:05,520 --> 01:05:07,636
I'm sorry. OK?

677
01:05:09,440 --> 01:05:13,752

done with last month's reviews.

678
01:05:13,880 --> 01:05:15,438
Yeah.

Look, are you sure about this, Lauryn?
Being back?

680
01:05:20,920 --> 01:05:23,388
It was Dad's shop.

681
01:05:23,520 --> 01:05:25,715
You know what it meant to him.

that you got the bicycle
on your eighth birthday?

685
01:05:36,200 --> 01:05:40,830
Yeah, I drove it in the shop, crashed
into the Buick and chipped my tooth.

686
01:05:40,960 --> 01:05:42,791
Yeah!

687
01:05:47,160 --> 01:05:49,958

you'll lose Dad's shop.
