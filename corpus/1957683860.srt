01:11:57,826 --> 01:12:00,195
with my daddy's belt
when he was drunk.

1314
01:12:00,327 --> 01:12:03,497
But I figured, I could
never screw up as bad as Jesus.

to deserve that.

1316

we've all been wronged,

01:12:25,120 --> 01:12:27,790
But with them words
I said up top,

1324
01:12:27,923 --> 01:12:30,826
Jesus asked his father, God,

1325
01:12:30,960 --> 01:12:33,295
to forgive the folks
tacking him up.

1326
01:12:33,428 --> 01:12:35,998

to condemn the world,

1330
01:12:43,305 --> 01:12:44,940
Think about it.

1331
01:12:45,074 --> 01:12:48,677
We ask Jesus to forgive us
our trespasses

1332
01:12:48,811 --> 01:12:51,947
as we forgive those
who trespass against us.

1333
01:12:54,149 --> 01:12:58,453
God's forgiveness is contingent
upon us forgiving others.

1334

That's the deal.

1335
01:13:01,056 --> 01:13:02,958
It ain't easy to do.

1336
01:13:03,092 --> 01:13:04,560
Truth is,

1337
01:13:04,693 --> 01:13:06,929
we ain't got no power
to do it ourselves.

It'll make you feel better too.

Oh. Yes, yes.

1358

As a matter of fact, I did.
Uh...

1359
01:14:09,459 --> 01:14:12,964
It's come to my attention that
there was a woman in your life,

1360
01:14:13,097 --> 01:14:15,666
prior to you entering
the seminary.

1361
01:14:15,800 --> 01:14:18,736
I was wondering, are you still
in contact with her?

1362
01:14:18,869 --> 01:14:21,272
No, not really.

1363
01:14:21,405 --> 01:14:22,573
I mean, she don't want much

1364
01:14:22,707 --> 01:14:24,275
to do with a man
she can't marry.

1365
01:14:24,408 --> 01:14:27,111
You know how Catholic girls are.
Or maybe you don't.

1366
01:14:27,244 --> 01:14:29,013
You strike me
as the kind of man

1367
01:14:29,146 --> 01:14:32,516
for whom rejection
only strengthens resolve.

1368
01:14:32,650 --> 01:14:34,986
Oh, don't ask me
where I got that notion.

1369
01:14:37,054 --> 01:14:38,923
Do you still think about her?

1370
01:14:40,057 --> 01:14:41,592
Of course I do.

1371
01:14:41,726 --> 01:14:43,527
Sexuality's a gift from God.

1372
01:14:43,661 --> 01:14:46,464
And denying it is denying
something he wanted us to have.

1373
01:14:46,597 --> 01:14:49,133
It's what you do with it
that matters.

1374
01:14:49,266 --> 01:14:51,669
Well,
I appreciate your candor.

1375
01:14:51,802 --> 01:14:54,071
Anyway,
I just want you to know,

01:14:54,205 --> 01:14:56,875
I'm always here,
if you need to talk,

1377
01:14:57,009 --> 01:14:58,176
