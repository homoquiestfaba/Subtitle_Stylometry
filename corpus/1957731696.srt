1
00:00:04,325 --> 00:00:07,115
(ambient music)

2
00:00:47,237 --> 00:00:49,007
(elevator bell chimes)

3
00:01:16,628 --> 00:01:18,038
(door knock)

4
00:01:22,969 --> 00:01:24,918
- [Man in shirt] Hey, Elijah. Come on in.

5
00:01:29,728 --> 00:01:31,748
- Elijah Young, star power bottom.

6
00:01:31,748 --> 00:01:33,108
- [Elijah] What's up, Demetrius?

7
00:01:33,108 --> 00:01:34,548
- Last time I saw you was in L.A.

8
00:01:34,548 --> 00:01:35,768
What was that, three years ago?

9
00:01:35,768 --> 00:01:37,388
- I think about four now.

10
00:01:37,388 --> 00:01:40,383
- Back then I was the star
and you is the star now.

11
00:01:40,383 --> 00:01:41,563
- You're still a star.

12
00:01:41,563 --> 00:01:44,723
- Nah, I'm not saying I'm
retiring, the diapers cost a lot.

13
00:01:44,723 --> 00:01:46,778
- Guys, paper work.

14
00:01:46,778 --> 00:01:48,739
- Wait a second. You're a dad now?

15
00:01:48,739 --> 00:01:51,019
- Yeah, Ricky and I adopted a little girl.

16
00:01:51,019 --> 00:01:52,379
- Congratulations.

17
00:01:52,379 --> 00:01:53,398
- Thanks, man.

18
00:01:53,398 --> 00:01:54,359
- ID and test results.

19
00:01:54,359 --> 00:01:55,828
- Thanks.

20
00:01:57,258 --> 00:01:58,458
- Do you have a copy of his?

21
00:01:58,458 --> 00:02:00,108
- Sure, right here.

22
00:02:01,998 --> 00:02:04,118
- Yeah so I'm a regular Mr. Mom now.

23
00:02:04,118 --> 00:02:05,219
- Do you have a picture?

24
00:02:05,219 --> 00:02:06,018
- A what?

25
00:02:06,018 --> 00:02:07,158
- Of your little girl.

26
00:02:07,158 --> 00:02:08,868
- Oh, of course.

27
00:02:12,178 --> 00:02:13,958
- Oh wow, she's adorable.

28
00:02:13,958 --> 00:02:14,998
- Thanks, man.

29
00:02:14,998 --> 00:02:16,619
- No problem.

30
00:02:16,619 --> 00:02:17,549
Thanks.

31
00:02:18,738 --> 00:02:20,678
I'm having a little
get-together on Saturday.

32
00:02:20,678 --> 00:02:22,478
I mean, you and Ricky are
more than welcome to come

33
00:02:22,478 --> 00:02:23,699
if you guys can get a sitter.

34
00:02:23,699 --> 00:02:26,058
- I mean, I'd be down
but Ricky has baby fever

35
00:02:26,058 --> 00:02:27,759
and we don't do the whole sitter thing.

36
00:02:27,759 --> 00:02:30,208
- I can definitely understand that.

37
00:02:58,018 --> 00:03:01,828
(Elijah and Demetrius moaning)

38
00:03:14,095 --> 00:03:18,185
(rolling train)

39
00:06:02,181 --> 00:06:03,496
(sighs)

40
00:06:03,496 --> 00:06:05,706
You're fucking kidding me.

41
00:06:09,016 --> 00:06:10,177
Seriously?

42
00:06:10,177 --> 00:06:12,716
Seriously, Geo? Are
you fucking kidding me?

43
00:06:12,716 --> 00:06:17,357
It's the first of the month and
you pull a disappearing act.

44
00:06:17,357 --> 00:06:19,791
Look, I know you were probably
waiting until the last minute

45
00:06:19,791 --> 00:06:21,751
to pull it off but I wish
you would have just come

46
00:06:21,751 --> 00:06:24,611
and talked to me, we could
have worked something out.

47
00:06:24,611 --> 00:06:27,091
Look, just call me back when you get this.

48
00:06:28,271 --> 00:06:30,061
Fuck.

49
00:06:35,631 --> 00:06:37,352
- [Rigo] So he's just gone?

50
00:06:37,352 --> 00:06:39,931
- [Elijah] Totally. It's like
he was never even here at all.

51
00:06:39,931 --> 00:06:41,392
Even scrubbed the bathroom clean.

52
00:06:41,392 --> 00:06:43,452
- Well that's something.

53
00:06:43,452 --> 00:06:44,472
What are you typing?

54
00:06:44,472 --> 00:06:46,871
- Nothing much, just
placing an ad on Craigslist.

55
00:06:46,871 --> 00:06:48,891
- That's inviting trouble.

56
00:06:48,891 --> 00:06:50,811
- Yeah, you're probably right.

57
00:06:50,811 --> 00:06:53,231
- [Rigo] But you should
be used to that by now.

58
00:06:53,231 --> 00:06:55,329
- Yeah yeah, whatever.

59
00:06:55,329 --> 00:06:57,449
Rigo, I just don't know what I'm gonna do.

60
00:06:57,449 --> 00:06:59,729
I can't afford this place
by myself and start classes

61
00:06:59,729 --> 00:07:02,369
in the fall, do you know
anyone who's looking?

62
00:07:02,369 --> 00:07:04,989
- Yeah Rashaad, like I know
anyone who would wanna dwell

63
00:07:04,989 --> 00:07:07,029
in the fucking republican boondocks.

64
00:07:07,029 --> 00:07:08,869
Seriously man, how do you do it?

65
00:07:08,869 --> 00:07:11,269
- I dwell anonymously,
thank you very much.

66
00:07:11,269 --> 00:07:14,909
And for your information
my congressman is democrat.

67
00:07:14,909 --> 00:07:16,749
- [Rigo] He's a conservicrat.

68
00:07:16,749 --> 00:07:18,709
- Okay, whatever.

69
00:07:18,709 --> 00:07:21,289
Look, I gotta go. I'm probably
gonna grab some takeout.

70
00:07:21,289 --> 00:07:22,609
See you Saturday?

71
00:07:22,609 --> 00:07:24,089
- I wouldn't miss it.

72
00:07:24,089 --> 00:07:25,499
- Sounds great.

73
00:07:46,015 --> 00:07:46,875
- Hi, Elijah.

74
00:07:46,875 --> 00:07:48,195
- Hey Tak, how's it goin'?

75
00:07:48,195 --> 00:07:49,795
- [Tak] Good.
- [Elijah] My order ready?

76
00:07:50,973 --> 00:07:52,621
- [Tak] Just a few minutes.
- [Elijah] No problem.

77
00:07:52,621 --> 00:07:53,679
- How was your day?

78
00:07:53,679 --> 00:07:55,459
- It was okay, I've had better.

79
00:07:55,459 --> 00:07:57,819
My roommate unexpectedly moved out.

80
00:07:57,819 --> 00:07:59,419
- Oh, I'm sorry.

81
00:07:59,419 --> 00:08:01,239
- [Elijah] No problem.
What can you do, right?

82
00:08:01,239 --> 00:08:03,519
- Did you find someone new?

83
00:08:03,519 --> 00:08:05,559
- Nah, I'll probably
start looking tomorrow.

84
00:08:05,559 --> 00:08:08,589
Why? Are you looking for a place?

85
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:18,007
- Okay, $9.75 please.

86
00:08:18,007 --> 00:08:19,505
- Oh yeah, right.

87
00:08:22,555 --> 00:08:24,235
Here you go, here's a 10.

88
00:08:24,235 --> 00:08:25,515
You can keep the change.

89
00:08:25,515 --> 00:08:27,475
- [Tak] Thank you.
- [Elijah] Yeah no problem.

90
00:08:27,475 --> 00:08:29,415
- [Tak] Thank you my
friend, have a good night.

91
00:08:29,415 --> 00:08:31,253
- Yeah, you too.

92
00:08:31,253 --> 00:08:36,033
- Oh wait, I forgot to
give you your receipt.

93
00:08:36,033 --> 00:08:37,793
- Oh okay, cool.

94
00:08:37,793 --> 00:08:39,593
Thanks, Tak. Good night.

95
00:08:39,593 --> 00:08:41,623
- [Tak] Goodnight, Elijah.

96
00:09:21,355 --> 00:09:23,345
(door knock)

97
00:09:57,217 --> 00:09:58,177
- Hi, Elijah.

98
00:09:58,177 --> 00:10:01,537
- Hey, you're early. Please, come in.

99
00:10:01,537 --> 00:10:04,757
- Sorry, I gave myself
extra time to get lost.

100
00:10:04,757 --> 00:10:06,837
- Don't worry about it, it's fine.

101
00:10:06,837 --> 00:10:07,757
- Shoes off?

102
00:10:07,757 --> 00:10:09,367
- Typically.

103
00:10:11,497 --> 00:10:12,937
A glass of wine?

104
00:10:12,937 --> 00:10:15,057
- Oh, no thank you.

105
00:10:15,057 --> 00:10:18,657
- Takeshi, just say yes
so I'm not drinking alone.

106
00:10:18,657 --> 00:10:20,337
- Okay, yes.

107
00:10:20,337 --> 00:10:21,477
- Excellent.

108
00:10:23,257 --> 00:10:26,105
I've recently developed a
taste for Chilean cabernet.

109
00:10:26,105 --> 00:10:28,055
They're kind of peppery.

110
00:10:33,045 --> 00:10:34,955
Here you go.

111
00:10:39,105 --> 00:10:41,305
- It's very nice.

112
00:10:41,305 --> 00:10:43,505
The only time I ever
had wine was in church

113
00:10:43,505 --> 00:10:44,725
when I was young.

114
00:10:44,725 --> 00:10:46,725
- Church, not temple?

115
00:10:46,725 --> 00:10:48,745
- I was raised Roman Catholic.

116
00:10:48,745 --> 00:10:51,385
- That's kind of unusual, isn't it?

117
00:10:51,385 --> 00:10:53,785
- A little. I grew up in Kirishima.

118
00:10:53,785 --> 00:10:56,445
There's actually a lot of Catholics there.

119
00:10:56,445 --> 00:10:57,605
- Interesting.

120
00:10:57,605 --> 00:10:59,445
Well I'm sure whatever they
were serving you in church

121
00:10:59,445 --> 00:11:01,025
wasn't half as good as this.

122
00:11:01,025 --> 00:11:02,805
- No, this is quite good.

123
00:11:02,805 --> 00:11:03,885
- Ready to see the room?

124
00:11:03,885 --> 00:11:04,845
- Yep.

125
00:11:04,845 --> 00:11:06,155
- This way.

126
00:11:15,045 --> 00:11:17,005
Well there's not much closet space but,

127
00:11:17,005 --> 00:11:18,305
there's more in the hall.

128
00:11:18,305 --> 00:11:20,905
- Oh no, this is more than sufficient.

129
00:11:20,905 --> 00:11:22,025
- Great.

130
00:11:22,025 --> 00:11:24,185
Well before we talk about
rent, we should probably

131
00:11:24,185 --> 00:11:25,945
discuss lifestyles.

132
00:11:25,945 --> 00:11:27,325
- Lifestyles?

133
00:11:27,325 --> 00:11:30,605
- [Elijah] As in, I'm
gay and I don't hide it.

134
00:11:30,605 --> 00:11:31,845
- I know.

135
00:11:31,845 --> 00:11:35,505
My co-workers all think
you're very flamboyant.

136
00:11:35,505 --> 00:11:37,125
- Oh, really?

137
00:11:37,125 --> 00:11:39,963
- [Takeshi] You dress very sexy.

138
00:11:39,963 --> 00:11:42,683
- Well I didn't think I
was being that obvious but,

139
00:11:42,683 --> 00:11:43,883
good to know.

140
00:11:43,883 --> 00:11:46,643
- Is it a problem for
you if I'm not like that?

141
00:11:46,643 --> 00:11:49,103
- Are you asking if it's a
problem that you're not gay?

142
00:11:49,103 --> 00:11:50,103
- [Takeshi] Yes.

143
00:11:50,103 --> 00:11:51,243
- Of course not.

144
00:11:51,243 --> 00:11:54,373
Come on, let me show you
the rest of the apartment.

145
00:11:55,423 --> 00:11:57,103
I go out of town a lot for work,

146
00:11:57,103 --> 00:11:59,232
so I'm looking for somebody
I can really trust.

147
00:11:59,232 --> 00:12:00,332
- What do you do?

148
00:12:00,332 --> 00:12:02,492
- I'm in the adult entertainment industry.

149
00:12:02,492 --> 00:12:04,752
I'm sorry. I meant to put these away.

150
00:12:04,752 --> 00:12:06,332
It's just a few proofs
the photographer sent me

151
00:12:06,332 --> 00:12:07,492
for my website.

152
00:12:07,492 --> 00:12:10,172
- [Takeshi] Those are
very erotic photographs.

153
00:12:10,172 --> 00:12:11,172
- You think so?

154
00:12:11,172 --> 00:12:12,392
- You're a model?

155
00:12:12,392 --> 00:12:13,212
- Something like.

156
00:12:13,212 --> 00:12:17,012
- Oh, adult entertainment.

157
00:12:17,012 --> 00:12:19,552
- Yeah, but I'm not about the party life.

158
00:12:19,552 --> 00:12:21,652
I prefer home to be a quiet place.

159
00:12:21,652 --> 00:12:23,032
- I understand.

160
00:12:23,032 --> 00:12:25,352
- I'm actually having a small
get-together on Saturday.

161
00:12:25,352 --> 00:12:27,192
Just a few friends, nothing major.

162
00:12:27,192 --> 00:12:28,672
So trust me, you're more
than welcome to have

163
00:12:28,672 --> 00:12:30,512
your girlfriend come over.

164
00:12:30,512 --> 00:12:32,812
- I don't have a girlfriend.

165
00:12:32,812 --> 00:12:34,752
- I'm sure that will change.

166
00:12:34,752 --> 00:12:37,672
So, when's the lease
at your other place up?

167
00:12:37,672 --> 00:12:38,972
- There's no lease.

168
00:12:38,972 --> 00:12:41,712
When I quit my job, they
won't let me live with the

169
00:12:41,712 --> 00:12:43,412
other employees.

170
00:12:43,412 --> 00:12:44,992
- You're quitting your job?

171
00:12:44,992 --> 00:12:47,352
- Now that I have my graduate degree,

172
00:12:47,352 --> 00:12:49,572
I want to start working in my field,

173
00:12:49,572 --> 00:12:51,992
information technology.

174
00:12:51,992 --> 00:12:53,792
- Cool. Interesting.

175
00:12:53,792 --> 00:12:56,232
So wait, you and your co-workers,

176
00:12:56,232 --> 00:12:57,992
you all live in the same house?

177
00:12:57,992 --> 00:12:59,292
- [Takeshi] Yes.

178
00:12:59,292 --> 00:13:01,592
- Like servant's quarters?

179
00:13:01,592 --> 00:13:04,792
- Kind of. It's very dirty and nasty.

180
00:13:04,792 --> 00:13:06,392
I can't wait to leave.

181
00:13:06,392 --> 00:13:08,652
- [Elijah] That's terrible.

182
00:13:08,652 --> 00:13:11,030
- You have such a beautiful home.

183
00:13:11,030 --> 00:13:13,530
I would really love to live here.

184
00:13:13,530 --> 00:13:14,390
- Thanks.

185
00:13:14,390 --> 00:13:17,150
Well the rent's about 1,600 a month.

186
00:13:17,150 --> 00:13:20,970
Since I have the larger
room, I say about 650,

187
00:13:20,970 --> 00:13:22,890
half utilities.

188
00:13:22,890 --> 00:13:26,670
- I can only afford 350 per month.

189
00:13:26,670 --> 00:13:28,390
- You're serious?

190
00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:29,890
- You look upset.

191
00:13:31,238 --> 00:13:35,158
- Takeshi, that's low like, really low.

192
00:13:35,158 --> 00:13:38,798
You can't even rent a closet
on Long Island for 350.

193
00:13:38,798 --> 00:13:41,838
- It's gonna take time
for me to find a job.

194
00:13:41,838 --> 00:13:46,038
I have saved enough money
to pay 350 for five months.

195
00:13:46,038 --> 00:13:49,078
As soon as I get a job I can
start paying the full rent

196
00:13:49,078 --> 00:13:51,558
and half the utilities.

197
00:13:51,558 --> 00:13:55,336
- I understand but I'm sorry,
that just doesn't work for me.

198
00:13:55,336 --> 00:13:56,096
(phone bleeps)

199
00:13:56,096 --> 00:13:57,596
Excuse me, I have to take this.

200
00:13:57,596 --> 00:13:59,226
It's for business.

201
00:14:10,536 --> 00:14:13,676
- [Takeshi] I will be a
very good roommate, Elijah.

202
00:14:13,676 --> 00:14:18,236
I will share in the
cooking, I am very clean.

203
00:14:18,236 --> 00:14:22,056
I see you in the restaurant
and I think you're a good man.

204
00:14:22,056 --> 00:14:24,016
- That's sweet of you to say, Takeshi

205
00:14:24,016 --> 00:14:25,776
but this is about money.

206
00:14:25,776 --> 00:14:26,876
Business.

207
00:14:26,876 --> 00:14:30,386
I'd love to help but,
I'm sorry, I just can't.

208
00:14:31,456 --> 00:14:33,334
- [Takeshi] I understand.

209
00:14:33,334 --> 00:14:34,834
- I'm sorry for wasting your time.

210
00:14:34,834 --> 00:14:36,804
Let me show you to the door.

211
00:14:38,434 --> 00:14:40,714
Wait, you haven't even finished your wine.

212
00:14:40,714 --> 00:14:41,974
- That's all right.

213
00:14:41,974 --> 00:14:44,134
I appreciate your hospitality.

214
00:14:44,134 --> 00:14:46,174
- Wait, you're an I.T. guy, right?

215
00:14:46,174 --> 00:14:46,914
- [Takeshi] Yes.

216
00:14:46,914 --> 00:14:48,654
- That means you know
about building websites.

217
00:14:48,654 --> 00:14:50,134
Designing them, I mean.

218
00:14:50,134 --> 00:14:53,454
- In Japan I studied graphic
and multimedia design.

219
00:14:53,454 --> 00:14:54,674
- [Elijah] Are you any good?

220
00:14:54,674 --> 00:14:55,914
- Very.

221
00:14:55,914 --> 00:14:59,934
- Well it just so happens I'm
looking for a website built.

222
00:14:59,934 --> 00:15:01,614
What do you think about a trade?

223
00:15:01,614 --> 00:15:04,034
I'll charge partial in
rent, in exchange you get my

224
00:15:04,034 --> 00:15:05,234
website up and running.

225
00:15:05,234 --> 00:15:06,514
- I would love that.

226
00:15:06,514 --> 00:15:08,914
- I mean, it has to be
first class, flawless.

227
00:15:08,914 --> 00:15:11,114
- It will be the very best.

228
00:15:11,114 --> 00:15:14,314
- Well I think you have
yourself a deal, Mr. Takeshi.

229
00:15:14,314 --> 00:15:15,974
How do you say cheers in Japanese?

230
00:15:15,974 --> 00:15:16,974
- Kanpai.

231
00:15:16,974 --> 00:15:18,504
- Kanpai.

232
00:15:21,554 --> 00:15:24,012
- So does this mean I
will be working in the

233
00:15:24,012 --> 00:15:25,820
adult entertainment industry?

234
00:15:25,820 --> 00:15:27,680
- (chuckles) Yeah, I guess it does.

235
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:28,720
- Oh.

236
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:30,540
How exciting.

237
00:15:30,540 --> 00:15:32,640
- Come on, man. Seriously,
you're killing me.

238
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:36,080
When would you like to move in?

239
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:37,060
- Tomorrow?

240
00:15:37,060 --> 00:15:38,770
- Tomorrow it is.

241
00:15:55,970 --> 00:16:00,160
(opera music)

242
00:19:35,344 --> 00:19:39,464
- [Rigo] Wait, so he has no job
and can't pay the full rent?

243
00:19:39,464 --> 00:19:41,044
Yeah, he's perfect.

244
00:19:41,044 --> 00:19:43,664
- He's sweet, and he knows how to cook.

245
00:19:43,664 --> 00:19:46,144
Besides, he's agreed to do my website.

246
00:19:46,144 --> 00:19:48,560
- Rashaad, you know how
Japanese people love curry?

247
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:51,254
That shit can really stink up the place.

248
00:19:52,603 --> 00:19:55,024
- You're right, I didn't think about that.

249
00:19:55,024 --> 00:19:57,464
- [Rigo] The smell permeates everything.

250
00:19:57,464 --> 00:19:58,944
- I guess we'll just
have to see how it goes

251
00:19:58,944 --> 00:20:01,723
and take it from there.

252
00:20:01,723 --> 00:20:04,324
- [Voiceover] Turn right
at the next street.

253
00:20:04,324 --> 00:20:06,283
- New client?

254
00:20:06,283 --> 00:20:07,423
- New location.

255
00:20:07,423 --> 00:20:09,663
The guy's never invited
me to his home before.

256
00:20:09,663 --> 00:20:11,244
It's usually a hotel.

257
00:20:11,244 --> 00:20:13,204
- (chuckles) His wife must be away.

258
00:20:13,204 --> 00:20:15,423
(phone bleeps)

259
00:20:15,423 --> 00:20:16,903
- Are you on Grinder?

260
00:20:16,903 --> 00:20:19,044
- [Rigo] Maybe. Don't judge me.

261
00:20:19,044 --> 00:20:20,823
- Okay whatever, Rigo.

262
00:20:20,823 --> 00:20:22,084
Look, I'm just about there.

263
00:20:22,084 --> 00:20:24,044
I'm gonna have to call you later, okay?

264
00:20:24,044 --> 00:20:24,984
- [Rigo] Bye.

265
00:20:24,984 --> 00:20:26,414
- Later.

266
00:21:03,058 --> 00:21:06,547
(jazz music)

267
00:21:20,519 --> 00:21:22,899
- [Elijah] Your collection of
classical music is impressive.

268
00:21:22,899 --> 00:21:24,138
- Thanks.

269
00:21:24,138 --> 00:21:25,978
- [Elijah] But there's no opera.

270
00:21:25,978 --> 00:21:28,319
- My father was a power orchestra fanatic.

271
00:21:28,319 --> 00:21:31,478
I guess I inherited his
distaste for lyrics.

272
00:21:31,478 --> 00:21:33,359
- I've always thought the
human voice was more expressive

273
00:21:33,359 --> 00:21:35,158
than any musical instrument.

274
00:21:35,158 --> 00:21:37,138
- I have no problem with the human voice.

275
00:21:37,138 --> 00:21:40,158
I just don't like words set to music.

276
00:21:40,158 --> 00:21:42,498
- Interesting distinction.

277
00:21:42,498 --> 00:21:44,438
So you don't think words are musical?

278
00:21:44,438 --> 00:21:45,678
- Not at all.

279
00:21:45,678 --> 00:21:47,218
Words have a musicality.

280
00:21:47,218 --> 00:21:49,159
Even a character of their own.

281
00:21:49,159 --> 00:21:51,979
I just think that words
and music spoil each other.

282
00:21:51,979 --> 00:21:54,628
They cancel each other out.

283
00:21:58,179 --> 00:22:00,699
- I see you have the
State of Queer anthology.

284
00:22:00,699 --> 00:22:03,018
My friend, well my ex,

285
00:22:03,018 --> 00:22:04,539
he has a few stories in here.

286
00:22:04,539 --> 00:22:06,858
- [Man] So do I actually.

287
00:22:06,858 --> 00:22:08,574
- [Elijah] You write?

288
00:22:08,574 --> 00:22:11,239
Oh, you do.

289
00:22:11,239 --> 00:22:12,918
So why are you in construction?

290
00:22:12,918 --> 00:22:14,298
- Drywall pays the bills.

291
00:22:14,298 --> 00:22:16,298
Writing is more of a hobby.

292
00:22:16,298 --> 00:22:17,718
- Thanks.

293
00:22:19,099 --> 00:22:20,988
- Cheers.

294
00:22:23,685 --> 00:22:25,105
- You must be pretty good.

295
00:22:25,105 --> 00:22:27,325
Hobbyists don't usually get published.

296
00:22:27,325 --> 00:22:28,465
- What's your ex's name?

297
00:22:28,465 --> 00:22:30,285
- Rigo. Rigoberto Gomez.

298
00:22:30,285 --> 00:22:31,145
- Really?

299
00:22:31,145 --> 00:22:33,525
His stories are among
the best. Very militant.

300
00:22:33,525 --> 00:22:35,265
- He sees himself as a bitter pill.

301
00:22:35,265 --> 00:22:36,745
The critics call him strident.

302
00:22:36,745 --> 00:22:38,105
- Is he that angry?

303
00:22:38,105 --> 00:22:39,645
- No, not really.

304
00:22:39,645 --> 00:22:42,406
He's elevated the act of
ranting into an art form.

305
00:22:42,406 --> 00:22:44,105
He's actually pretty funny though.

306
00:22:44,105 --> 00:22:46,065
A constant stream of commentary.

307
00:22:46,065 --> 00:22:47,886
- [Man] Oh, I can see that.

308
00:22:47,886 --> 00:22:49,586
- So you into jazz too?

309
00:22:49,586 --> 00:22:52,586
- A little bit. Feel
improvisational tonight.

310
00:22:52,586 --> 00:22:55,406
- Improvisations aren't scripted.

311
00:22:57,045 --> 00:22:59,006
"I'm a married man from Puerto Rico

312
00:22:59,006 --> 00:23:01,305
"who frequently comes to
Long Island on business."

313
00:23:01,305 --> 00:23:03,804
- Help yourself to some cheese.
The Gorgonzola is amazing.

314
00:23:03,804 --> 00:23:06,644
- "I'm a hung, verbal top
who enjoys drilling the fight

315
00:23:06,644 --> 00:23:08,544
"out of twink power bottoms.

316
00:23:08,544 --> 00:23:10,864
"And I love a submissive
boy in a jockstrap."

317
00:23:10,864 --> 00:23:13,384
- I know what my Daddy
Search profile says.

318
00:23:13,384 --> 00:23:15,464
- What's up with this, Bryson?

319
00:23:15,464 --> 00:23:17,284
- It's just a scenario.

320
00:23:17,284 --> 00:23:20,684
So is this, but our
dialogue is improvised.

321
00:23:20,684 --> 00:23:23,044
- What's this scenario?

322
00:23:23,044 --> 00:23:27,324
- A man invites another man
into his home for dinner.

323
00:23:27,324 --> 00:23:28,962
- That's omitting a lot.

324
00:23:28,962 --> 00:23:30,662
- What details need to be filled in?

325
00:23:30,662 --> 00:23:34,242
- A lot, I mean, you're fit, attractive.

326
00:23:34,242 --> 00:23:36,282
You're not my typical clientele.

327
00:23:36,282 --> 00:23:38,582
You have a photo of yourself
hugged up with another guy

328
00:23:38,582 --> 00:23:40,723
so you're obviously not in the closet.

329
00:23:40,723 --> 00:23:42,042
- Definitely not.

330
00:23:42,042 --> 00:23:44,102
- Yet, you pretend to
be a married businessman

331
00:23:44,102 --> 00:23:45,642
from out of town.

332
00:23:45,642 --> 00:23:49,182
- I play the role that works best for me.

333
00:23:49,182 --> 00:23:52,582
- I guess we both have that in common.

334
00:23:52,582 --> 00:23:55,782
- Do you find reality less interesting?

335
00:23:55,782 --> 00:23:57,722
- Perplexing.

336
00:23:57,722 --> 00:24:00,422
So what made you decide
to draw back the curtains?

337
00:24:00,422 --> 00:24:01,822
- I hadn't had a date in years.

338
00:24:01,822 --> 00:24:04,142
Aside from my family,
you're the first person

339
00:24:04,142 --> 00:24:06,582
I invited to my home in a long time.

340
00:24:06,582 --> 00:24:07,802
- [Elijah] Why me?

341
00:24:07,802 --> 00:24:10,882
- You're intelligent, a
good conversationalist.

342
00:24:10,882 --> 00:24:13,542
- And paid, so no judgements here.

343
00:24:13,542 --> 00:24:16,862
- [Bryson] I'm sure you see
more than your share of freaks.

344
00:24:16,862 --> 00:24:18,722
- Are you a freak?

345
00:24:18,722 --> 00:24:20,882
- I was in an abusive
relationship so you might say

346
00:24:20,882 --> 00:24:24,222
I was damaged by the experience.

347
00:24:24,222 --> 00:24:26,302
- That's not hard to understand.

348
00:24:26,302 --> 00:24:28,082
At least not from me.

349
00:24:28,082 --> 00:24:30,322
Certainly doesn't make you a freak.

350
00:24:30,322 --> 00:24:33,872
- I wasn't the victim,
Elijah. I was the abuser.

351
00:24:38,182 --> 00:24:39,362
- So what are you making?

352
00:24:39,362 --> 00:24:42,102
- A mofongo, it's a Puerto Rican dish.

353
00:24:42,102 --> 00:24:43,822
My mother's recipe.

354
00:24:43,822 --> 00:24:45,772
- I'm sure it'll be great.

355
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:59,370
(Elijah moaning)

356
00:25:12,970 --> 00:25:16,720
(ambient music)

357
00:25:47,530 --> 00:25:51,360
(birds chirping)

358
00:26:18,805 --> 00:26:20,035
Wow.

359
00:26:23,105 --> 00:26:24,385
Very fancy.

360
00:26:24,385 --> 00:26:26,145
- All I had was some toast, maybe eggs

361
00:26:26,145 --> 00:26:28,885
but I have to leave for work soon.

362
00:26:28,885 --> 00:26:31,345
- This is sweet. Thank you.

363
00:26:31,345 --> 00:26:35,325
- I like performing the role
of the affectionate mate.

364
00:26:35,325 --> 00:26:37,665
- I don't think it's
performing a role, Bryson.

365
00:26:37,665 --> 00:26:39,185
It's who you are.

366
00:26:39,185 --> 00:26:42,785
It was the perfect date and
you're ending it perfectly.

367
00:26:42,785 --> 00:26:44,725
- Had it been a real
date, I would have learned

368
00:26:44,725 --> 00:26:47,745
as much about you as you did about me.

369
00:26:47,745 --> 00:26:49,745
- I kinda got the
impression I was a stand-in

370
00:26:49,745 --> 00:26:50,925
for someone else.

371
00:26:50,925 --> 00:26:52,325
- Maybe, I was hoping you would

372
00:26:52,325 --> 00:26:54,165
shine through my projections.

373
00:26:54,165 --> 00:26:56,505
- I told you a lot about myself.

374
00:26:56,505 --> 00:26:58,285
- You dropped enough
hints to make me believe

375
00:26:58,285 --> 00:26:59,945
we were having a real conversation.

376
00:26:59,945 --> 00:27:03,485
For the most part, you were
playing at being Elijah Young.

377
00:27:03,485 --> 00:27:04,885
- Playing at being?

378
00:27:04,885 --> 00:27:06,605
Sounds like words from a book.

379
00:27:06,605 --> 00:27:07,645
- Sorry.

380
00:27:07,645 --> 00:27:11,105
- Stolen words from a man who
doesn't need to pay for it.

381
00:27:11,105 --> 00:27:13,225
But does anyway.

382
00:27:13,225 --> 00:27:15,445
- The Long Island gay community is small,

383
00:27:15,445 --> 00:27:18,385
and my past is public record.

384
00:27:18,385 --> 00:27:21,625
- An exile, that I understand.

385
00:27:21,625 --> 00:27:23,345
- [Bryson] Really?

386
00:27:23,345 --> 00:27:25,825
- Let's just say my life is...

387
00:27:25,825 --> 00:27:27,105
complicated.

388
00:27:27,105 --> 00:27:28,855
- Do tell.

389
00:27:31,473 --> 00:27:33,873
No peaking behind the curtain?

390
00:27:33,873 --> 00:27:35,683
Not even a little?

391
00:27:38,953 --> 00:27:41,063
- That's not up for sale.

392
00:28:55,015 --> 00:28:56,425
(door knock)

393
00:28:57,595 --> 00:28:59,825
Oh, go away.

394
00:29:05,915 --> 00:29:07,805
(door knock)

395
00:29:08,735 --> 00:29:10,325
(groans)

396
00:29:14,115 --> 00:29:15,645
(door knock)

397
00:29:24,053 --> 00:29:25,443
- Hi, Elijah.

398
00:29:26,933 --> 00:29:28,473
- Do you have a lot to move in?

399
00:29:28,473 --> 00:29:30,991
- No no, just some clothes and a futon.

400
00:29:30,991 --> 00:29:32,531
- Think you can handle it yourself?

401
00:29:32,531 --> 00:29:34,011
I didn't get much sleep last night.

402
00:29:34,011 --> 00:29:35,491
- That's fine, my friend.

403
00:29:35,491 --> 00:29:36,811
I'll be very quiet.

404
00:29:36,811 --> 00:29:38,949
- Great well, make yourself at home.

405
00:29:38,949 --> 00:29:41,199
I should be up in a few hours.

406
00:31:45,447 --> 00:31:46,717
- Hey, Kayla.

407
00:31:47,847 --> 00:31:49,217
Of course you don't.

408
00:31:52,287 --> 00:31:53,297
Really?

409
00:31:54,687 --> 00:31:57,363
Oh well I've got something to tell you.

410
00:31:58,373 --> 00:32:01,533
I've got something to tell you, listen!

411
00:32:01,533 --> 00:32:03,833
Me and Stefan, we broke up.

412
00:32:05,113 --> 00:32:07,053
Yes, again. I know I know I know.

413
00:32:07,053 --> 00:32:08,383
Well, he cheated.

414
00:32:11,173 --> 00:32:13,273
Yes with Christina.

415
00:32:13,273 --> 00:32:15,191
That's who he cheated with.

416
00:32:15,191 --> 00:32:16,631
It's like I want to take
him back but then again

417
00:32:16,631 --> 00:32:18,551
I don't want to.

418
00:32:19,831 --> 00:32:21,931
Really? You think so?

419
00:32:21,931 --> 00:32:25,541
I was thinking about us going
to counselling or something.

420
00:32:28,431 --> 00:32:30,831
Yeah really, but you know.

421
00:32:30,831 --> 00:32:32,931
I don't know, I think it could work.

422
00:32:32,931 --> 00:32:33,991
What do you think?

423
00:32:33,991 --> 00:32:36,861
'Cause I need some type
of friendly advice.

424
00:32:39,611 --> 00:32:43,109
Last time? We've been through
this like five times already.

425
00:32:43,109 --> 00:32:47,139
(dark ambient music)

426
00:33:56,211 --> 00:33:58,101
What are you lookin' at?

427
00:34:12,747 --> 00:34:15,597
(Elijah groaning)

428
00:34:58,325 --> 00:35:00,595
- Welcome to the dorm.

429
00:35:16,159 --> 00:35:18,479
Somethin' smells good.

430
00:35:18,479 --> 00:35:21,059
- I was hoping you like curry.

431
00:35:21,059 --> 00:35:22,939
- I've only had it a few times.

432
00:35:22,939 --> 00:35:24,139
Chicken or beef?

433
00:35:24,139 --> 00:35:25,199
- Chicken.

434
00:35:25,199 --> 00:35:26,639
(Elijah chuckles)

435
00:35:26,639 --> 00:35:27,679
What's so funny?

436
00:35:27,679 --> 00:35:29,519
- Nothing, don't worry about it.

437
00:35:29,519 --> 00:35:32,209
Um, I'll grab a bottle of chardonnay.

438
00:36:23,727 --> 00:36:24,837
(phone bleeps)

439
00:37:38,149 --> 00:37:39,359
(phone bleeps)

440
00:37:45,453 --> 00:37:46,723
(Bryson chuckles)

441
00:37:50,451 --> 00:37:53,231
I really like how Macho
Fuckers done their website.

442
00:37:53,231 --> 00:37:55,591
There's like an easy simplicity to it.

443
00:37:55,591 --> 00:37:58,261
But you see here...

444
00:38:01,431 --> 00:38:03,589
I like how Breed It Raw
displays their models.

445
00:38:03,589 --> 00:38:05,049
Think we could do something like this?

446
00:38:05,049 --> 00:38:08,689
- Sure, you just have
to choose the criteria.

447
00:38:08,689 --> 00:38:10,569
- By names, alphabetically by first

448
00:38:10,569 --> 00:38:12,569
since most models only use one.

449
00:38:12,569 --> 00:38:14,649
Then by whether they're tops or bottoms

450
00:38:14,649 --> 00:38:16,869
and then by ethnicity.

451
00:38:16,869 --> 00:38:18,869
- Tops or...

452
00:38:18,869 --> 00:38:20,329
- Bottoms.

453
00:38:20,329 --> 00:38:21,829
Sorry, gay stuff.

454
00:38:21,829 --> 00:38:24,809
Uh, tops fuck, bottoms get fucked.

455
00:38:24,809 --> 00:38:27,589
- Oh. Which are you?

456
00:38:27,589 --> 00:38:28,569
- Total bottom.

457
00:38:28,569 --> 00:38:30,769
The chicken curry is incredible, Takeshi.

458
00:38:30,769 --> 00:38:33,529
- I'm glad you like it.
Are you on these sites?

459
00:38:33,529 --> 00:38:35,069
- Of course.

460
00:38:35,069 --> 00:38:37,169
- Oh.

461
00:38:37,169 --> 00:38:41,749
Elijah Young, a hot
twink from New York City.

462
00:38:41,749 --> 00:38:43,769
He's hot to death.

463
00:38:43,769 --> 00:38:48,659
Just look at that tight meaty
ass any tops wanna beat.

464
00:38:48,659 --> 00:38:51,549
Elijah loves the hole dug out

465
00:38:51,549 --> 00:38:54,989
and he effortlessly gives

466
00:38:54,989 --> 00:38:58,799
ultra-hung tops a run for their money.

467
00:39:00,109 --> 00:39:02,649
Is Rashaad Jackson your real name?

468
00:39:02,649 --> 00:39:04,329
- You saw the mail?

469
00:39:04,329 --> 00:39:06,669
- Yes.

470
00:39:06,669 --> 00:39:09,189
Wow, you've done a lot of videos!

471
00:39:09,189 --> 00:39:10,129
Are you famous?

472
00:39:10,129 --> 00:39:11,509
- Too famous.

473
00:39:11,509 --> 00:39:14,589
Sometimes I feel like my
life isn't my own anymore.

474
00:39:14,589 --> 00:39:16,049
- What do you mean?

475
00:39:16,049 --> 00:39:17,629
- [Elijah] Just people, I mean.

476
00:39:17,629 --> 00:39:19,669
Complete strangers think they know me.

477
00:39:19,669 --> 00:39:22,229
Some even think they own a piece of me.

478
00:39:22,229 --> 00:39:24,569
- How?

479
00:39:24,569 --> 00:39:26,889
- Sometimes I would go to
clubs and guys would corner me

480
00:39:26,889 --> 00:39:29,049
in the bathrooms as if I owed them sex

481
00:39:29,049 --> 00:39:31,329
just because they bought
a DVD or had a membership

482
00:39:31,329 --> 00:39:32,549
to one of the sites.

483
00:39:32,549 --> 00:39:33,409
- [Takeshi] Really?

484
00:39:33,409 --> 00:39:34,469
- Oh yeah.

485
00:39:34,469 --> 00:39:36,789
There was this one time,
and this is really weird.

486
00:39:36,789 --> 00:39:39,529
I was at a Taco Bell in
Manhattan, so this guys comes up

487
00:39:39,529 --> 00:39:42,069
to my table and he's like,
"You keep eating like that and

488
00:39:42,069 --> 00:39:45,297
"you're gonna get fat and I'm
not gonna buy your videos."

489
00:39:45,297 --> 00:39:47,097
- That's very rude.

490
00:39:47,097 --> 00:39:48,697
- The rudeness I can tolerate.

491
00:39:48,697 --> 00:39:50,797
It's when they become
physical that's the problem.

492
00:39:50,797 --> 00:39:52,697
I've been jumped one too many times.

493
00:39:52,697 --> 00:39:53,977
- Gay bashers?

494
00:39:53,977 --> 00:39:55,317
Out here?

495
00:39:55,317 --> 00:39:57,637
- No, drunk gay guys outside the clubs.

496
00:39:57,637 --> 00:39:59,877
Trying to force me to drop my pants.

497
00:39:59,877 --> 00:40:01,477
- Oh my god.

498
00:40:01,477 --> 00:40:03,317
That's crazy.

499
00:40:03,317 --> 00:40:07,147
- Yeah, I just realized I
had to move out of the city.

500
00:40:08,197 --> 00:40:10,637
- If you don't mind me asking,

501
00:40:10,637 --> 00:40:12,437
why do you still do it?

502
00:40:12,437 --> 00:40:13,337
- Porn?

503
00:40:13,337 --> 00:40:17,057
- [Takeshi] Yeah, if it's
causing you so many problems.

504
00:40:17,057 --> 00:40:19,617
- Honestly, it's like this, Tak.

505
00:40:19,617 --> 00:40:22,197
I enjoy exploring my sexuality.

506
00:40:22,197 --> 00:40:23,815
Plus the internet is forever.

507
00:40:23,815 --> 00:40:26,895
Even if I stop tomorrow,
my videos are everywhere.

508
00:40:26,895 --> 00:40:29,315
I'm one of the highest paid
bottoms in urban bareback porn

509
00:40:29,315 --> 00:40:33,405
right now, I'm making the most of it.

510
00:40:36,035 --> 00:40:39,303
- It must be very tough
to have a relationship.

511
00:40:40,433 --> 00:40:41,733
- Yeah.

512
00:40:41,733 --> 00:40:44,193
It is, very tough.

513
00:40:44,193 --> 00:40:47,873
But you have to understand,
most guys just wanna fuck me.

514
00:40:47,873 --> 00:40:50,913
I'm a fantasy to me, not a person.

515
00:40:50,913 --> 00:40:54,703
So with that, I've put
dating on the back-burner.

516
00:40:57,591 --> 00:41:00,091
- Do you think there's a
difference between Elijah

517
00:41:00,091 --> 00:41:01,861
and Rashaad?

518
00:41:02,871 --> 00:41:05,291
- No one's ever asked me a
question like that before.

519
00:41:05,291 --> 00:41:06,891
- Well?

520
00:41:06,891 --> 00:41:10,011
- Rashaad is soft, sensitive even.

521
00:41:10,011 --> 00:41:12,451
A naive kid who moved to
New York from North Carolina

522
00:41:12,451 --> 00:41:14,611
with hopes of becoming an actor.

523
00:41:14,611 --> 00:41:17,271
- And Elijah Young?

524
00:41:17,271 --> 00:41:19,571
- Driven. Determined.

525
00:41:19,571 --> 00:41:22,091
A bit cold, maybe. Detached.

526
00:41:22,091 --> 00:41:24,681
But with swag. (chuckles)

527
00:41:25,771 --> 00:41:29,921
- Do you still want to
pursue an acting career?

528
00:41:29,921 --> 00:41:31,911
- Given what I do now,
I think that particular

529
00:41:31,911 --> 00:41:34,991
career path is closed off.

530
00:41:34,991 --> 00:41:36,971
But I'm standing to be chef though.

531
00:41:36,971 --> 00:41:40,131
Probably leave New York and
Elijah Young in the past.

532
00:41:40,131 --> 00:41:41,311
So you have to teach me how to make

533
00:41:41,311 --> 00:41:43,351
authentic Japanese dishes.

534
00:41:43,351 --> 00:41:45,481
- Yes I will.

535
00:43:19,231 --> 00:43:22,401
- I wasn't the victim,
Elijah, I was the abuser.

536
00:43:28,229 --> 00:43:31,459
I was hoping you would shine
through my projections.

537
00:43:36,065 --> 00:43:40,015
No peaking behind the
curtain? Not even a little?

538
00:45:55,763 --> 00:45:59,243
(Elijah moaning)

539
00:45:59,243 --> 00:46:00,513
- Shit.

540
00:46:03,263 --> 00:46:04,023
Fuck.

541
00:46:04,991 --> 00:46:06,241
Oh, yeah.

542
00:46:07,431 --> 00:46:11,361
(moaning)

543
00:46:14,231 --> 00:46:15,381
Shit.

544
00:46:16,611 --> 00:46:20,061
(moaning)

545
00:46:37,523 --> 00:46:39,913
(muffled laughter from outside)

546
00:47:33,991 --> 00:47:35,531
(door knock)

547
00:47:35,531 --> 00:47:37,091
Takeshi?

548
00:47:37,091 --> 00:47:37,951
- Hey.

549
00:47:37,951 --> 00:47:39,471
- What are you doin'?

550
00:47:39,471 --> 00:47:42,181
- Uh, I...

551
00:47:43,291 --> 00:47:45,551
- I wouldn't have pegged
you as the voyeur type.

552
00:47:45,551 --> 00:47:47,631
- I'm not really.

553
00:47:47,631 --> 00:47:49,111
- It's cool, man.

554
00:47:49,111 --> 00:47:52,111
I've actually watched Mr.
Casanova myself a few times.

555
00:47:52,111 --> 00:47:53,571
- [Takeshi] Casanova?

556
00:47:53,571 --> 00:47:56,891
- My nickname for our neighbor.

557
00:47:56,891 --> 00:48:00,099
Damn. Look at them go at it.

558
00:48:00,099 --> 00:48:02,459
Now I see why you're springing a chub.

559
00:48:02,459 --> 00:48:03,499
- What?

560
00:48:03,499 --> 00:48:05,099
- Pitching the tent?

561
00:48:05,099 --> 00:48:08,199
Hold on. Think I got something.

562
00:48:08,199 --> 00:48:10,029
- What are you doing?

563
00:48:12,719 --> 00:48:15,079
- Here, take this.

564
00:48:15,079 --> 00:48:16,699
Got them when I went
to see Tosca at the Met

565
00:48:16,699 --> 00:48:18,699
with my friend Rigo.

566
00:48:18,699 --> 00:48:22,419
Total nosebleed seats but
it was totally worth it.

567
00:48:22,419 --> 00:48:24,199
Do you like opera?

568
00:48:24,199 --> 00:48:26,639
- [Takeshi] I really haven't
listened to enough of it

569
00:48:26,639 --> 00:48:28,459
to have an opinion.

570
00:48:28,459 --> 00:48:31,119
- [Elijah] Shit. Look at that guy.

571
00:48:31,119 --> 00:48:32,719
Man, he's got game.

572
00:48:32,719 --> 00:48:34,819
Different chick every night.

573
00:48:34,819 --> 00:48:36,459
- [Takeshi] Do you admire that?

574
00:48:36,459 --> 00:48:38,019
- [Elijah] Sure, who wouldn't?

575
00:48:38,019 --> 00:48:40,899
- But you have sex all the time.

576
00:48:40,899 --> 00:48:42,919
- It's not about getting laid, Takeshi.

577
00:48:42,919 --> 00:48:44,119
It's about power.

578
00:48:44,119 --> 00:48:46,439
Take him for instance.

579
00:48:46,439 --> 00:48:49,799
He's hot, not the best
looking guy in the world.

580
00:48:49,799 --> 00:48:53,937
Pretty decent apartment, nice
car but he's not wealthy.

581
00:48:53,937 --> 00:48:56,337
What he's got is attitude.

582
00:48:56,337 --> 00:48:58,737
- Do you act like that when you're Elijah?

583
00:48:58,737 --> 00:49:00,757
- [Elijah] Nah. Not really.

584
00:49:00,757 --> 00:49:02,517
But I'm a trained actor.

585
00:49:02,517 --> 00:49:05,267
I can be him anytime I want.

586
00:49:07,117 --> 00:49:09,577
- Why do you think he's arrogant?

587
00:49:09,577 --> 00:49:10,837
- [Elijah] Damn.

588
00:49:10,837 --> 00:49:12,397
- What?

589
00:49:12,397 --> 00:49:14,857
- Look like the show's over, my friend.

590
00:49:14,857 --> 00:49:16,797
I'll leave you to rub one out.

591
00:49:16,797 --> 00:49:19,217
- Elijah, why do you think he's arrogant?

592
00:49:19,217 --> 00:49:21,467
- Shit man, I'm sorry.

593
00:49:27,937 --> 00:49:29,717
I guess you have to have
the strength of arrogance

594
00:49:29,717 --> 00:49:32,277
to be able to pull a hottie
like that back to your place.

595
00:49:32,277 --> 00:49:35,195
Without paying for it, that is.

596
00:49:35,195 --> 00:49:39,315
- You're mixing up the coupons
from Shishis with these.

597
00:49:39,315 --> 00:49:41,103
- I'm sorry, man.

598
00:49:41,103 --> 00:49:42,743
Look, I'm not gonna pretend to know a guy

599
00:49:42,743 --> 00:49:45,163
just by looking through his
window for a few minutes.

600
00:49:45,163 --> 00:49:47,263
Now that would be arrogant.

601
00:49:47,263 --> 00:49:50,043
None of us are made of
just one thing, Takeshi.

602
00:49:50,043 --> 00:49:53,763
We're all made of many ingredients
in different proportions.

603
00:49:53,763 --> 00:49:56,983
Orson Welles once said,
"Acting is like sculpture.

604
00:49:56,983 --> 00:49:59,663
"It's not what you add to
yourself that makes character,

605
00:49:59,663 --> 00:50:03,563
"it's what you flick away."

606
00:50:03,563 --> 00:50:07,123
- So if you're playing
someone who's shy and afraid?

607
00:50:07,123 --> 00:50:10,143
- Strip away the
confidence, the certainty.

608
00:50:10,143 --> 00:50:11,783
What's left?

609
00:50:11,783 --> 00:50:14,463
The doubt. The fear.

610
00:50:14,463 --> 00:50:16,593
Just fills in the void.

611
00:50:18,123 --> 00:50:20,303
- I am shy and afraid.

612
00:50:20,303 --> 00:50:21,483
- Are you kidding me?

613
00:50:21,483 --> 00:50:23,163
I only had to come here
from North Carolina

614
00:50:23,163 --> 00:50:24,463
to start a new life.

615
00:50:24,463 --> 00:50:27,503
You had to board a plane
and fly across the planet.

616
00:50:27,503 --> 00:50:29,543
That took major balls.

617
00:50:29,543 --> 00:50:32,353
You don't give yourself
nearly enough credit.

618
00:50:34,363 --> 00:50:36,323
- Rashaad.

619
00:50:36,323 --> 00:50:37,603
- Yeah?

620
00:50:37,603 --> 00:50:39,843
- Thank you for being my friend.

621
00:50:39,843 --> 00:50:41,583
(Elijah chuckles)

622
00:50:41,583 --> 00:50:42,963
- Don't mention it.

623
00:50:42,963 --> 00:50:44,503
Night, Tak.

624
00:50:44,503 --> 00:50:46,253
- Goodnight.

625
00:51:01,715 --> 00:51:03,135
- Real talk.

626
00:51:03,135 --> 00:51:05,355
How's everything going
with the new roommate?

627
00:51:05,355 --> 00:51:06,935
- So far so good.

628
00:51:06,935 --> 00:51:09,455
He made chicken curry the other night.

629
00:51:09,455 --> 00:51:11,393
- [Rigo] Told you so!

630
00:51:11,393 --> 00:51:13,693
- It was delicious so don't be an asshole.

631
00:51:13,693 --> 00:51:16,773
- You think this is actually
going to work out, don't you?

632
00:51:16,773 --> 00:51:18,813
- Well you know, I hope so.

633
00:51:18,813 --> 00:51:20,073
I think so.

634
00:51:20,073 --> 00:51:21,853
He's sweet.

635
00:51:21,853 --> 00:51:23,993
- [Rigo] And?

636
00:51:23,993 --> 00:51:26,811
- I don't know, he's been
here for years now but,

637
00:51:26,811 --> 00:51:28,391
he's a little isolated.

638
00:51:28,391 --> 00:51:29,511
- What do you mean?

639
00:51:29,511 --> 00:51:30,711
- I found his Facebook.

640
00:51:30,711 --> 00:51:33,611
- Great, you've turned
into a cyber-stalker.

641
00:51:33,611 --> 00:51:36,971
- I am not stalking, I was just...

642
00:51:36,971 --> 00:51:38,331
curious.

643
00:51:38,331 --> 00:51:40,151
- [Rigo] Okay, so what did you find?

644
00:51:40,151 --> 00:51:41,431
- Fiction, mostly.

645
00:51:41,431 --> 00:51:43,411
He has these wall posts
that dates back like,

646
00:51:43,411 --> 00:51:44,951
two years or so.

647
00:51:44,951 --> 00:51:47,511
They're all about his
daily commute in Manhattan.

648
00:51:47,511 --> 00:51:49,531
Bitching about people in the subway.

649
00:51:49,531 --> 00:51:51,591
I.T. related problems at work.

650
00:51:51,591 --> 00:51:53,591
He even has this one
photo of some blonde chick

651
00:51:53,591 --> 00:51:55,491
he says is his girlfriend.

652
00:51:55,491 --> 00:51:57,751
But it's all fiction though. Lies.

653
00:51:57,751 --> 00:51:58,971
Everything.

654
00:51:58,971 --> 00:52:00,331
- It's just his idealized self.

655
00:52:00,331 --> 00:52:02,491
The life he imagined
when he first came here.

656
00:52:02,491 --> 00:52:04,471
Kinda reminds me of someone.

657
00:52:04,471 --> 00:52:05,311
- Who?

658
00:52:05,311 --> 00:52:06,611
- You.

659
00:52:06,611 --> 00:52:09,271
- Oh, yeah. Right.

660
00:52:09,271 --> 00:52:11,251
- Don't you remember what
your Facebook wall was like

661
00:52:11,251 --> 00:52:12,571
when we first met?

662
00:52:12,571 --> 00:52:14,311
All the auditions you were going on.

663
00:52:14,311 --> 00:52:16,751
How close your were to getting an agent.

664
00:52:16,751 --> 00:52:18,071
Your selfies were a trip.

665
00:52:18,071 --> 00:52:20,371
- Well technically I
was going on auditions.

666
00:52:20,371 --> 00:52:22,171
- It was mostly bullshit!

667
00:52:22,171 --> 00:52:24,791
- You say bullshit, I say embellishment.

668
00:52:24,791 --> 00:52:26,431
We'll leave it at that.

669
00:52:26,431 --> 00:52:29,251
- And like you, he does it
for the people back home.

670
00:52:29,251 --> 00:52:32,611
Now, Rashaad Jackson virtually
ceases to exist online,

671
00:52:32,611 --> 00:52:35,711
whereas Elijah Young has
over 40,000 followers.

672
00:52:35,711 --> 00:52:38,211
- 60,000 now, FYI.

673
00:52:38,211 --> 00:52:40,411
- Well, not one of them are
interested in getting to know

674
00:52:40,411 --> 00:52:42,471
the real you and you're not
even remotely interested

675
00:52:42,471 --> 00:52:45,551
in letting them so...

676
00:52:45,551 --> 00:52:47,611
are you ready yet?

677
00:52:47,611 --> 00:52:49,751
- I believe it's show time.

678
00:52:49,751 --> 00:52:51,321
- [Rigo] Finally.

679
00:52:55,091 --> 00:52:57,271
- [Elijah] So we're having
this whole production weekend,

680
00:52:57,271 --> 00:53:00,251
I think it was for Raw Stallions
or some shit like that.

681
00:53:00,251 --> 00:53:02,349
So like a few of us models,
you know, we're all vibing

682
00:53:02,349 --> 00:53:04,409
chilling at the hotel or whatever

683
00:53:04,409 --> 00:53:06,709
and you know, me and this
one model, we're really like,

684
00:53:06,709 --> 00:53:08,449
kicking it and like
vibing with each other.

685
00:53:08,449 --> 00:53:09,729
But you know, he's a little too feminine,

686
00:53:09,729 --> 00:53:13,649
a little too cunty for him
to fuck me so, you know,

687
00:53:13,649 --> 00:53:15,877
we go to a back room
or whatever, you know,

688
00:53:15,877 --> 00:53:17,757
we start feeling each other
so you know, I don't care,

689
00:53:17,757 --> 00:53:19,805
I'm top and he's sexy as fuck.

690
00:53:19,805 --> 00:53:21,385
So you know, we're starting
to do it or whatever,

691
00:53:21,385 --> 00:53:23,405
you know, we switch
positions, he's now riding me,

692
00:53:23,405 --> 00:53:25,125
just bouncing up and
down on my dick, you know

693
00:53:25,125 --> 00:53:27,265
and I'm loving it at first,
I'm thinking he's starting to

694
00:53:27,265 --> 00:53:28,605
climax and the next thing I know

695
00:53:28,605 --> 00:53:31,025
this spring just shoots out on my chest.

696
00:53:31,025 --> 00:53:32,645
I didn't think nothing of
it at first, so you know,

697
00:53:32,645 --> 00:53:34,985
we're just getting it in, he's
just bouncing and bouncing

698
00:53:34,985 --> 00:53:37,265
and bouncing but the
next thing I know, like,

699
00:53:37,265 --> 00:53:39,925
his dick just shoots
up and the spring just

700
00:53:39,925 --> 00:53:41,985
shoots me in the face and gets in my mouth

701
00:53:41,985 --> 00:53:45,065
and the next thing I know,
it's like piss and I'm like,

702
00:53:45,065 --> 00:53:48,585
"Yo, this man is having a whole
orgasmic piss all over me."

703
00:53:48,585 --> 00:53:51,765
He's moaning to the guys
and thinking nothing of it

704
00:53:51,765 --> 00:53:53,905
and then we finish and he's just like,

705
00:53:53,905 --> 00:53:55,605
"Are you ready to go again?"

706
00:53:55,605 --> 00:53:57,745
- Holy shit!

707
00:53:57,745 --> 00:54:00,045
- [Man with glasses] So I was like, 19,

708
00:54:00,045 --> 00:54:03,385
almost 20-years-old and I was just,

709
00:54:03,385 --> 00:54:06,165
being out, being at the bars, doing stuff.

710
00:54:06,165 --> 00:54:09,845
It was all very new to me and I was like,

711
00:54:09,845 --> 00:54:11,525
going out all the time and you know,

712
00:54:11,525 --> 00:54:16,225
this is before the days of
Grinder and stuff and...

713
00:54:16,225 --> 00:54:19,865
I was like, sleeping with
another guy every weekend night.

714
00:54:19,865 --> 00:54:22,605
Friday, Saturday, Sunday, it
would just be another one.

715
00:54:22,605 --> 00:54:25,825
I was like, you know,
being a total young slut!

716
00:54:25,825 --> 00:54:29,225
And you know, at the time
it was like tops were like,

717
00:54:29,225 --> 00:54:32,819
the rare thing, everyone
seemed to be a bottom.

718
00:54:32,819 --> 00:54:36,465
And so it's like, you could
still be a skinny, nerdy top

719
00:54:36,465 --> 00:54:39,485
and you know, hey you got the equipment,

720
00:54:39,485 --> 00:54:41,565
I'll get the job done.

721
00:54:43,575 --> 00:54:46,135
But I didn't realize how
much I was sleeping around.

722
00:54:46,135 --> 00:54:49,875
I had only been out total at
the bars for like six months.

723
00:54:49,875 --> 00:54:51,995
And...

724
00:54:51,995 --> 00:54:54,155
one night we had the home bar,

725
00:54:54,155 --> 00:54:56,535
it was on the near north side of Chicago,

726
00:54:56,535 --> 00:54:58,255
we were getting together.

727
00:54:58,255 --> 00:55:00,095
It was our home bar, we would
start, have a few drinks

728
00:55:00,095 --> 00:55:03,175
then go off and see a play,
see a movie, see whatever

729
00:55:03,175 --> 00:55:06,295
and I walk in and I'm the first one,

730
00:55:06,295 --> 00:55:08,295
and I'm with four or five of my friends

731
00:55:08,295 --> 00:55:10,295
and I'm the first one, I
open the door and I walk in

732
00:55:10,295 --> 00:55:12,595
and pretty much everyone I had slept with

733
00:55:12,595 --> 00:55:15,135
in the last four, five six months

734
00:55:15,135 --> 00:55:16,775
was around the bar.

735
00:55:16,775 --> 00:55:19,395
(group laughing)
And I'm looking and I'm like,

736
00:55:19,395 --> 00:55:20,195
"Fuck!"

737
00:55:20,195 --> 00:55:24,275
And I stop and it was
like the three stooges.

738
00:55:24,275 --> 00:55:26,975
It's like my friends just piled into me.

739
00:55:26,975 --> 00:55:29,295
Then I turn around they're
still like bumping into me,

740
00:55:29,295 --> 00:55:31,355
I'm talking like, "No, we
can't go here, we gotta go."

741
00:55:31,355 --> 00:55:32,955
"What's wrong? What's wrong?"

742
00:55:32,955 --> 00:55:34,335
Everything is wrong.

743
00:55:34,335 --> 00:55:36,055
I mean, it was like my
whole sexual history

744
00:55:36,055 --> 00:55:37,415
is having a drink!

745
00:55:37,415 --> 00:55:40,933
(group laughing)

746
00:55:40,933 --> 00:55:43,973
Oh my god, it was just way too much.

747
00:55:43,973 --> 00:55:45,653
So we had to go elsewhere.

748
00:55:45,653 --> 00:55:47,733
I didn't go back to that bar for a while.

749
00:55:47,733 --> 00:55:50,213
- [Man in black shirt] So I
had this roommate in college.

750
00:55:50,213 --> 00:55:53,173
Tall, blonde hair, blue eyes.

751
00:55:53,173 --> 00:55:54,573
Gorgeous.

752
00:55:54,573 --> 00:55:57,233
Total homophobe.

753
00:55:57,233 --> 00:55:58,833
Come to find out

754
00:55:58,833 --> 00:56:01,113
that this dude dresses up as
a woman in his spare time.

755
00:56:01,113 --> 00:56:03,653
(group murmurs)

756
00:56:03,653 --> 00:56:07,261
He pulls out a container
full of women's lingerie.

757
00:56:07,261 --> 00:56:11,151
(group laughing)

758
00:56:13,908 --> 00:56:16,325
- Well, how did he explain it?

759
00:56:16,325 --> 00:56:17,723
I mean, what did he say?

760
00:56:17,723 --> 00:56:20,423
- [Man in black shirt] He
just showed me the lingerie.

761
00:56:20,423 --> 00:56:22,463
- And when you found him
was he still homophobic?

762
00:56:22,463 --> 00:56:24,423
(group laughing)

763
00:56:24,423 --> 00:56:26,763
- Did he try modelling it
for you? Did he put it on?

764
00:56:29,061 --> 00:56:30,981
- [Man in black shirt] He
told me he was still straight.

765
00:56:30,981 --> 00:56:33,041
- Okay, did he ever do drag show?

766
00:56:33,041 --> 00:56:34,731
- [Man in black shirt]
With his girlfriend.

767
00:56:35,954 --> 00:56:37,007
- Well that's bonding.

768
00:56:37,007 --> 00:56:39,207
- [Man in black shirt] Yeah, really.

769
00:56:39,207 --> 00:56:41,207
- "Look sweetie, we can
wear the same outfits!"

770
00:56:41,207 --> 00:56:42,527
(group laughing)

771
00:56:42,527 --> 00:56:44,327
- [Takeshi] Um, this is
not something I remember

772
00:56:44,327 --> 00:56:47,087
but something my mother
and my sister told me.

773
00:56:47,087 --> 00:56:51,347
But when I was five or six
there was this neighbor lady,

774
00:56:51,347 --> 00:56:54,987
probably my parents'
friend or whatever but,

775
00:56:54,987 --> 00:56:59,567
whenever my mother have
to leave me alone at home,

776
00:56:59,567 --> 00:57:04,127
she asked this lady to
take of me but then,

777
00:57:04,127 --> 00:57:07,795
later she said, when she came back home,

778
00:57:07,795 --> 00:57:09,635
she found me dressed as a girl.

779
00:57:09,635 --> 00:57:13,215
(group laughing)

780
00:57:13,215 --> 00:57:16,155
This lady enjoyed dressing me as a girl.

781
00:57:16,155 --> 00:57:19,495
Then my mother tell me this story like was

782
00:57:19,495 --> 00:57:22,295
a memory from my childhood.

783
00:57:22,295 --> 00:57:26,245
But with mom, just that's
not very good for the child.

784
00:57:27,415 --> 00:57:30,295
- Did your mom ever like,

785
00:57:30,295 --> 00:57:33,615
ask why was this neighbor lady
dressing you up as a girl?

786
00:57:33,615 --> 00:57:34,775
Did this ever come up?

787
00:57:34,775 --> 00:57:37,595
- [Takeshi] No, she made it a fun story.

788
00:57:37,595 --> 00:57:38,975
(group laughing)

789
00:57:38,975 --> 00:57:40,635
- [Man in blue shirt] So
in colleges, when I decided

790
00:57:40,635 --> 00:57:43,035
I wanted to give older men a try

791
00:57:43,035 --> 00:57:47,215
and I met up with this
guy from Adam for Adam.

792
00:57:47,215 --> 00:57:49,875
I didn't really look at his
pictures before going there

793
00:57:49,875 --> 00:57:52,275
and when I got there he answered the door

794
00:57:52,275 --> 00:57:54,655
and he was this big, huge guy

795
00:57:54,655 --> 00:57:56,935
and if you've ever seen
that show Dinosaurs,

796
00:57:56,935 --> 00:58:01,515
he looked like that only
a giant Ninja Turtle.

797
00:58:01,515 --> 00:58:03,955
And when I get in, he didn't ask for sex

798
00:58:03,955 --> 00:58:07,755
he asked me to give him a
massage and I felt so weird!

799
00:58:07,755 --> 00:58:09,255
It gets to the point
where I'm rubbing his back

800
00:58:09,255 --> 00:58:11,835
and it's really really
gross and it's spotted

801
00:58:11,835 --> 00:58:14,615
and at the end he offered to pay me

802
00:58:14,615 --> 00:58:17,975
and offer to give my number to his friends

803
00:58:17,975 --> 00:58:21,235
to give them massages and
I absolutely made sure

804
00:58:21,235 --> 00:58:25,275
to avoid that guy...
(group laughing)

805
00:58:25,275 --> 00:58:26,765
forever.

806
00:58:28,375 --> 00:58:32,075
(classical music)

807
00:58:32,075 --> 00:58:34,915
- You know, when I was
their age, if I wanted

808
00:58:34,915 --> 00:58:38,155
to get laid I would have
to put on a clean shirt,

809
00:58:38,155 --> 00:58:41,135
go to a bar and socialize.

810
00:58:41,135 --> 00:58:44,505
Now, everyone has their
face buried in a cellphone.

811
00:58:49,075 --> 00:58:51,235
- [Rigo] Is this your first gay party?

812
00:58:51,235 --> 00:58:55,055
- Yes. Everyone has been very nice.

813
00:58:55,055 --> 00:58:56,915
- The crowd is very sedate,

814
00:58:56,915 --> 00:59:00,155
but they all plan on
going out to a club later.

815
00:59:00,155 --> 00:59:01,343
- You too?

816
00:59:01,343 --> 00:59:03,563
- (chuckles) No.

817
00:59:03,563 --> 00:59:06,363
I'm kind of over the club scene.

818
00:59:06,363 --> 00:59:08,483
- I've never been a nightclub.

819
00:59:08,483 --> 00:59:10,963
It seems exciting.

820
00:59:10,963 --> 00:59:14,343
- (chuckles) Do you want to go?

821
00:59:14,343 --> 00:59:17,773
- Probably not tonight.

822
00:59:19,583 --> 00:59:22,543
Elijah say you're his ex.

823
00:59:22,543 --> 00:59:25,963
- Yep, and I'm not the
only one in the room.

824
00:59:27,463 --> 00:59:30,623
(chuckles) No, not him.

825
00:59:30,623 --> 00:59:32,703
That's a client he's deluded
himself into thinking

826
00:59:32,703 --> 00:59:34,243
is boyfriend material.

827
00:59:35,763 --> 00:59:37,683
- You don't think he is?

828
00:59:37,683 --> 00:59:40,543
- I've read his short stories.

829
00:59:40,543 --> 00:59:43,823
There's a lot of dark and sticky
stuff beneath the surface.

830
00:59:43,823 --> 00:59:45,003
Trust me.

831
00:59:45,003 --> 00:59:47,871
That dude's got more issues than Newsweek.

832
00:59:47,871 --> 00:59:49,571
No.

833
00:59:49,571 --> 00:59:50,751
Him.

834
00:59:52,051 --> 00:59:53,197
- [Takeshi] The older man?

835
00:59:53,197 --> 00:59:54,237
Phillip?

836
00:59:54,237 --> 00:59:56,737
- A client-turned-lover-now-friend.

837
00:59:56,737 --> 00:59:59,117
Very familiar pattern.

838
00:59:59,117 --> 01:00:01,177
- Why did they break up?

839
01:00:01,177 --> 01:00:03,337
- Mm, same as me.

840
01:00:03,337 --> 01:00:07,057
Being the boyfriend of a pornstar is...

841
01:00:07,057 --> 01:00:08,717
complicated.

842
01:00:08,717 --> 01:00:12,837
- Did you know Elijah
before he started doing it?

843
01:00:12,837 --> 01:00:15,157
- We were living together at the time.

844
01:00:15,157 --> 01:00:18,137
The first video he ever did was with me.

845
01:00:18,137 --> 01:00:19,317
- Really?

846
01:00:19,317 --> 01:00:21,497
- Yeah, we were living in Brooklyn.

847
01:00:21,497 --> 01:00:23,257
Totally broke.

848
01:00:23,257 --> 01:00:24,897
He was temping during the day.

849
01:00:24,897 --> 01:00:27,497
Got a job dancing at a club at night.

850
01:00:27,497 --> 01:00:30,757
Then he got noticed by the
head of this porn outfit.

851
01:00:30,757 --> 01:00:34,037
- And you did it together?

852
01:00:34,037 --> 01:00:35,517
- Yep.

853
01:00:35,517 --> 01:00:37,777
But they didn't want me though.

854
01:00:37,777 --> 01:00:40,677
They wanted a twink to pair
up with their muscle tops.

855
01:00:40,677 --> 01:00:43,197
But he wouldn't do it
with anybody else, well,

856
01:00:43,197 --> 01:00:45,897
not at first anyway.

857
01:00:45,897 --> 01:00:49,837
So, I became his agent
and sometimes his pimp.

858
01:00:49,837 --> 01:00:52,077
- What do you mean, pimp?

859
01:00:52,077 --> 01:00:53,877
- He had a few pro ads on Adam for Adam

860
01:00:53,877 --> 01:00:55,537
and a few other sites.

861
01:00:55,537 --> 01:00:58,737
I would screen the tricks, set up meets.

862
01:00:58,737 --> 01:01:01,197
He was still auditioning for
parts in off Broadway plays

863
01:01:01,197 --> 01:01:04,277
and little indie films.

864
01:01:04,277 --> 01:01:07,417
And I was desperately
trying to get published.

865
01:01:07,417 --> 01:01:11,185
- If you were so encouraging,
why did you end it?

866
01:01:12,397 --> 01:01:16,657
- Ego. Fragile masculinity.

867
01:01:16,657 --> 01:01:19,415
I felt reduced.

868
01:01:19,415 --> 01:01:22,575
I know they say that sex
isn't the same as lovemaking,

869
01:01:22,575 --> 01:01:25,503
especially on camera but...

870
01:01:25,503 --> 01:01:29,163
- I think I understand.

871
01:01:29,163 --> 01:01:32,883
- He had given up so much, too much.

872
01:01:32,883 --> 01:01:35,243
Just so the electricity bill would be paid

873
01:01:35,243 --> 01:01:37,843
and we wouldn't end up on the streets.

874
01:01:37,843 --> 01:01:41,283
He's so smart, Takeshi, so talented.

875
01:01:41,283 --> 01:01:42,743
The crime of it all though is,

876
01:01:42,743 --> 01:01:45,183
he hasn't even begun to realize his gifts.

877
01:01:46,843 --> 01:01:49,721
- I think Takeshi will be
in need of rescuing soon.

878
01:01:49,721 --> 01:01:50,481
- [Bryson] Why?

879
01:01:50,481 --> 01:01:52,941
- Rigo is brooding like Max von Sydow.

880
01:01:52,941 --> 01:01:55,901
He's more fun when he's
in Denis Leary mode.

881
01:01:55,901 --> 01:01:59,201
- How do you even know
who Max von Sydow is?

882
01:01:59,201 --> 01:02:01,401
- You don't seem to think that much of me.

883
01:02:01,401 --> 01:02:03,281
I have to tell you, it's
a little disappointing.

884
01:02:03,281 --> 01:02:05,481
- Sorry, I didn't mean it like that.

885
01:02:05,481 --> 01:02:07,881
- Sure you didn't.

886
01:02:07,881 --> 01:02:11,601
You were kinda quiet at dinner tonight.

887
01:02:11,601 --> 01:02:14,741
- How many of your friends are exes?

888
01:02:14,741 --> 01:02:17,401
- And I see you've also
forgotten how to talk to people.

889
01:02:17,401 --> 01:02:21,471
Or do you no longer see the
need to be polite with me?

890
01:02:25,421 --> 01:02:27,831
Looks like I'm being summoned.

891
01:02:33,241 --> 01:02:34,611
(phone bleeping)

892
01:02:46,791 --> 01:02:47,831
- All right, everybody.

893
01:02:47,831 --> 01:02:49,891
This is a poem I was thinking
of reading next Thursday

894
01:02:49,891 --> 01:02:53,101
at the open mic, I hope you guys enjoy it.

895
01:02:54,451 --> 01:02:56,811
Bobby was born an American boy.

896
01:02:56,811 --> 01:02:58,571
Baby blues and all.

897
01:02:58,571 --> 01:03:01,351
Even before birth his sex was set.

898
01:03:01,351 --> 01:03:03,211
He was normal as a child, climbed trees

899
01:03:03,211 --> 01:03:05,571
and bled as most boys do the color red.

900
01:03:05,571 --> 01:03:07,711
But inside his closet lay a secret.

901
01:03:07,711 --> 01:03:11,551
A box the color pink, emanating
a perfume of sweet lilies.

902
01:03:11,551 --> 01:03:15,011
Inside this sissy box were
Barbies, lipstick and jewels.

903
01:03:15,011 --> 01:03:18,491
Things a boy should never have,
that is what his dad said.

904
01:03:18,491 --> 01:03:20,071
In middle school he was a monster.

905
01:03:20,071 --> 01:03:22,231
He pulled and poked at all
the girls and ran faster

906
01:03:22,231 --> 01:03:23,871
than all the boys after picking fights

907
01:03:23,871 --> 01:03:25,771
and darkening the other's eye.

908
01:03:25,771 --> 01:03:28,871
Bobby was an all-American
boy but behind closed doors,

909
01:03:28,871 --> 01:03:32,251
Bobby became Brenda and
she was an American girl.

910
01:03:32,251 --> 01:03:34,271
By high school his box became a trunk

911
01:03:34,271 --> 01:03:36,771
and now the color black for
it was easier to conceal

912
01:03:36,771 --> 01:03:39,171
and slide away from Mom's cleaning eye.

913
01:03:39,171 --> 01:03:40,691
Bobby fit in well.

914
01:03:40,691 --> 01:03:42,971
He was still faster than all
the boys but he didn't bother

915
01:03:42,971 --> 01:03:44,771
to grow, not at all.

916
01:03:44,771 --> 01:03:46,951
But one day Dad met
Brenda and Bobby's speed

917
01:03:46,951 --> 01:03:49,131
could do no good to save
him from the black and blues

918
01:03:49,131 --> 01:03:50,571
or the color red.

919
01:03:50,571 --> 01:03:52,691
Brenda had been busted
and all that remained

920
01:03:52,691 --> 01:03:55,111
was a boy, an American and all.

921
01:03:55,111 --> 01:03:57,551
Mom came in shortly,
she didn't look his way.

922
01:03:57,551 --> 01:03:59,291
She went into his closet, took his trunk

923
01:03:59,291 --> 01:04:01,131
and his pink box too, held her hands out

924
01:04:01,131 --> 01:04:03,031
and asked for her rings back.

925
01:04:03,031 --> 01:04:05,211
He trembled as he removed
them, struggling to get past

926
01:04:05,211 --> 01:04:08,531
the swelling then off
she went without a word.

927
01:04:08,531 --> 01:04:10,891
Bobby ran into the bathroom, he used tears

928
01:04:10,891 --> 01:04:13,511
and sit in water to strip his
face of his stolen secret.

929
01:04:13,511 --> 01:04:15,951
He pulled from his body her
tattered remains, placed himself

930
01:04:15,951 --> 01:04:18,711
into a tub and let the
water run past his nose.

931
01:04:18,711 --> 01:04:22,191
Under he lay, hating who
he was and who he wasn't.

932
01:04:22,191 --> 01:04:24,071
Watching everything fade.

933
01:04:24,071 --> 01:04:26,171
And just before he got too deep,

934
01:04:26,171 --> 01:04:28,911
he emerged, alone.

935
01:04:28,911 --> 01:04:30,731
Brenda had been drowned.

936
01:04:30,731 --> 01:04:34,431
And now there was Bobby,
baby blues and all.

937
01:04:34,431 --> 01:04:37,291
At last, an American.

938
01:04:37,291 --> 01:04:37,991
Thank you.

939
01:04:37,991 --> 01:04:39,431
- Wow.

940
01:04:39,431 --> 01:04:43,221
(group applauds)

941
01:05:02,137 --> 01:05:03,417
(door knock)

942
01:05:03,417 --> 01:05:04,887
- Come in.

943
01:05:06,157 --> 01:05:07,737
- Hey, Takeshi.

944
01:05:07,737 --> 01:05:10,257
Just wanted to let you know
we're about to head out.

945
01:05:10,257 --> 01:05:12,917
- Okay, have a good time my friend.

946
01:05:12,917 --> 01:05:14,837
- [Elijah] Are you sure
you don't wanna come?

947
01:05:14,837 --> 01:05:18,097
- Thank you but I'm rather tired.

948
01:05:18,097 --> 01:05:20,557
- Okay well, I guess I'll
probably be staying out

949
01:05:20,557 --> 01:05:23,797
in Manhattan tonight so,
see you in the morning.

950
01:05:23,797 --> 01:05:25,037
- Okay.

951
01:05:25,037 --> 01:05:26,527
- [Elijah] Goodnight.

952
01:05:27,617 --> 01:05:28,767
(door closing)

953
01:05:35,875 --> 01:05:37,725
(Takeshi sighs)

954
01:06:58,013 --> 01:07:00,053
Hey guys, how's it going tonight?

955
01:07:00,053 --> 01:07:02,553
It's your favorite power
bottom here, Elijah Young.

956
01:07:02,553 --> 01:07:04,793
You guys miss me?

957
01:07:06,373 --> 01:07:08,021
Aw, that's sweet.

958
01:07:08,021 --> 01:07:10,531
Thanks beetlebot, thanks papabear.

959
01:07:12,721 --> 01:07:15,231
It's nice to be back with your guys too.

960
01:07:17,061 --> 01:07:19,331
Oh yeah, very busy.

961
01:07:22,121 --> 01:07:26,499
So I went shopping earlier,
bought some very sexy underwear.

962
01:07:26,499 --> 01:07:28,769
You guys want me to model it for you?

963
01:07:30,039 --> 01:07:31,237
Okay.

964
01:08:07,825 --> 01:08:11,925
Oh yeah, my feet are a little dirty.

965
01:08:11,925 --> 01:08:15,085
A group of us was playing
frisbee in the park.

966
01:08:15,085 --> 01:08:17,475
I just hate wearing shoes.

967
01:08:21,561 --> 01:08:23,971
So what do you guys think?

968
01:08:26,661 --> 01:08:28,441
Short enough?

969
01:08:28,441 --> 01:08:30,571
Sexy enough?

970
01:08:32,941 --> 01:08:35,061
How about a strip show?

971
01:08:35,061 --> 01:08:37,661
I'm sure you guys wanna
see the rest, right?

972
01:08:37,661 --> 01:08:39,861
Wanna see me naked?

973
01:08:39,861 --> 01:08:41,311
Hot.

974
01:08:44,053 --> 01:08:47,743
But first, I may need a little help.

975
01:08:49,513 --> 01:08:52,333
I need a hot scenario.

976
01:08:52,333 --> 01:08:55,003
A kinky scenario.

977
01:08:55,003 --> 01:08:57,933
One that's gonna get me extra...

978
01:08:57,933 --> 01:08:59,723
rock hard.

979
01:10:15,049 --> 01:10:16,839
(Takeshi sniffing)

980
01:12:45,711 --> 01:12:48,491
And I thought I was
supposed to be the actor.

981
01:12:48,491 --> 01:12:50,711
- [Takeshi] Shit.

982
01:12:50,711 --> 01:12:53,131
I...

983
01:12:53,131 --> 01:12:53,831
I'm so sorry.

984
01:12:53,831 --> 01:12:55,331
- No, it's fine.

985
01:12:55,331 --> 01:12:58,101
It's fine.

986
01:12:58,101 --> 01:12:59,911
You look nice.

987
01:12:59,911 --> 01:13:01,821
Really nice.

988
01:13:05,151 --> 01:13:08,951
- I never worn trendy clothes.

989
01:13:08,951 --> 01:13:11,291
Even in the stores.

990
01:13:11,291 --> 01:13:15,001
I'd feel too ridiculous
to even try them on.

991
01:13:15,991 --> 01:13:19,031
- And how do you feel wearing them now?

992
01:13:19,031 --> 01:13:20,939
Attractive?

993
01:13:20,939 --> 01:13:24,869
- I look at myself in your mirror and...

994
01:13:26,559 --> 01:13:27,899
- And what?

995
01:13:30,539 --> 01:13:32,039
- I like myself.

996
01:13:34,359 --> 01:13:37,599
But, I also know they're not me.

997
01:13:37,599 --> 01:13:39,739
- Why not?

998
01:13:39,739 --> 01:13:42,959
- It's all surface.

999
01:13:42,959 --> 01:13:44,939
- They're just clothes, Tak.

1000
01:13:44,939 --> 01:13:47,839
They're supposed to make you feel good.

1001
01:13:50,059 --> 01:13:54,499
- I never thought my
life would be like this.

1002
01:13:54,499 --> 01:13:58,159
- You imagined your life
differently in the U.S.?

1003
01:13:59,459 --> 01:14:02,969
- I sometimes think about
going back to Japan.

1004
01:14:02,969 --> 01:14:03,969
(chuckles)

1005
01:14:03,969 --> 01:14:08,189
But on Facebook I told so many falsehoods.

1006
01:14:09,229 --> 01:14:12,844
Posted things to make everyone
think that I'm so happy

1007
01:14:12,844 --> 01:14:15,264
and successful.

1008
01:14:15,264 --> 01:14:18,954
If I went back, they'll
know it was all lies.

1009
01:14:20,824 --> 01:14:23,004
- I think I can relate.

1010
01:14:23,004 --> 01:14:24,604
If you had any idea what my life was like

1011
01:14:24,604 --> 01:14:28,964
back in North Carolina,
the class I'm from.

1012
01:14:28,964 --> 01:14:31,224
Tak, my mom's a pediatrician.

1013
01:14:31,224 --> 01:14:33,444
My dad's an attorney.

1014
01:14:33,444 --> 01:14:37,564
- They didn't approve of you
becoming an actor, did they?

1015
01:14:37,564 --> 01:14:38,904
- No.

1016
01:14:38,904 --> 01:14:40,644
They didn't.

1017
01:14:40,644 --> 01:14:43,664
Even after all these years,
they think eventually I'll just

1018
01:14:43,664 --> 01:14:47,044
give it all up and come back home.

1019
01:14:47,044 --> 01:14:48,264
- Will you?

1020
01:14:50,964 --> 01:14:52,864
- I can't.

1021
01:14:52,864 --> 01:14:56,689
You know, the other night
when you had asked me

1022
01:14:56,689 --> 01:14:59,629
the difference between Elijah and Rashaad,

1023
01:14:59,629 --> 01:15:02,169
I realized something.

1024
01:15:02,169 --> 01:15:05,629
Rashaad no longer exists.

1025
01:15:05,629 --> 01:15:09,419
You know, New York has its way of...

1026
01:15:10,629 --> 01:15:11,979
I don't know.

1027
01:15:13,609 --> 01:15:15,039
- Crushing you.

1028
01:15:16,849 --> 01:15:18,049
- Exactly.

1029
01:15:20,339 --> 01:15:23,389
- In Japan I had a life.

1030
01:15:23,389 --> 01:15:25,939
Not what I wanted but...

1031
01:15:27,249 --> 01:15:31,149
here, I got nothing.

1032
01:15:31,149 --> 01:15:33,069
I'm nobody.

1033
01:15:33,069 --> 01:15:34,479
Invisible.

1034
01:15:35,789 --> 01:15:38,529
- And do you think...

1035
01:15:38,529 --> 01:15:41,359
wearing my clothes makes you visible?

1036
01:15:46,949 --> 01:15:49,389
- Look at me.

1037
01:15:49,389 --> 01:15:51,339
This is so pathetic.

1038
01:15:53,957 --> 01:15:56,397
Look at me, I'm in another man's bedroom

1039
01:15:56,397 --> 01:16:00,537
wearing his clothes, I'm insane!

1040
01:16:00,537 --> 01:16:01,397
- [Elijah] Come on, just --

1041
01:16:01,397 --> 01:16:06,097
- You should be furious with
me for invading your privacy!

1042
01:16:06,097 --> 01:16:07,033
- [Elijah] Come on, Tak, just stop.

1043
01:16:07,033 --> 01:16:08,853
- I am disgusting.

1044
01:16:08,853 --> 01:16:10,453
Pathetic and disgusting!

1045
01:16:10,453 --> 01:16:12,843
- Just relax.

1046
01:16:25,533 --> 01:16:28,633
- I've, I've never --

1047
01:16:28,633 --> 01:16:30,163
- It's fine.

1048
01:16:35,233 --> 01:16:38,363
You're not disgusting. You're beautiful.

1049
01:16:48,953 --> 01:16:50,383
Beautiful.

1050
01:16:53,253 --> 01:16:57,503
(ambient music)
(Takeshi and Elijah moaning)

1051
01:18:57,913 --> 01:19:00,843
(opera music)
