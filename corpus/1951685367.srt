1
00:00:06,006 --> 00:00:07,974
I was with a guy that...

2
00:00:08,008 --> 00:00:10,169
I knew was
shooting drugs.

3
00:00:10,210 --> 00:00:12,735
He had $100,000
in this arm,

4
00:00:12,779 --> 00:00:15,509
and he had $50,000
in this arm.

5
00:00:15,548 --> 00:00:18,346
And I said,
"Okay, go to the doctor.

6
00:00:18,385 --> 00:00:20,012
Get a test

7
00:00:20,053 --> 00:00:22,112
before we even
do anything."

8
00:00:22,155 --> 00:00:25,522
And then I just threw
all that out the closet

9
00:00:25,558 --> 00:00:26,991
and said "Later" for it.

10
00:00:28,094 --> 00:00:30,153
Me and Slick used
to get high together.

11
00:00:30,196 --> 00:00:32,289
Then he got locked up.
He called me.

12
00:00:32,332 --> 00:00:34,391
He created
this story about...

13
00:00:34,434 --> 00:00:38,564
his friends in jail had gotten tested,
you know, some of them,

14
00:00:38,605 --> 00:00:40,368
and they came up positive.

15
00:00:40,407 --> 00:00:44,070
And he thought that
I should get tested.

16
00:00:44,110 --> 00:00:46,544
As soon as he said that, I knew it.

17
00:00:46,579 --> 00:00:49,013
I knew it.
I knew it. I knew it.

18
00:00:49,049 --> 00:00:50,676
I was ready to kill his ass.

19
00:00:50,717 --> 00:00:52,844
I was ready to kill myself.
I was ready to kill somebody,

20
00:00:52,886 --> 00:00:55,150
you know? Shit.

21
00:00:55,188 --> 00:00:56,587
We have felt it.

22
00:00:56,623 --> 00:00:59,183
"Oh, he loves me.
You know, he would tell me.

23
00:00:59,225 --> 00:01:01,159
He wouldn't..." you know.

24
00:01:01,194 --> 00:01:04,459
And I just told myself
a whole bunch of bullshit.

25
00:01:04,497 --> 00:01:06,465
You know?
Just a bunch of bullshit.

26
00:01:06,499 --> 00:01:08,364
- Yeah.
- I knew that he slept with other women.

27
00:01:08,401 --> 00:01:10,835
I also knew that,
you know, he shot drugs.

28
00:01:10,870 --> 00:01:13,430
But I was like,
"No, whatever."

29
00:01:13,473 --> 00:01:15,441
I guess in the back of my mind
I had this crazy thing

30
00:01:15,475 --> 00:01:17,705
about how I was just
gonna, you know,

31
00:01:17,744 --> 00:01:19,905
prove how much I loved him
and how much better

32
00:01:19,946 --> 00:01:22,244
I was than all
the women that he had.

33
00:01:22,282 --> 00:01:25,183
And I was going...
just I was going to show my love.

34
00:01:25,218 --> 00:01:28,187
I was so stupid. And sometimes
I wake up in the middle of the night

35
00:01:28,221 --> 00:01:31,190
mad at myself. I'd be like,
"Girl, you're so dumb."

36
00:01:31,224 --> 00:01:34,682
I was young.
He was older.

37
00:01:34,727 --> 00:01:36,558
He looked nice.

38
00:01:36,596 --> 00:01:37,858
I asked him.

39
00:01:37,897 --> 00:01:40,058
He said no.
And that was it.

40
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:43,831
The condoms were sitting
right there in a basket.

41
00:01:43,870 --> 00:01:46,634
They were sitting right there.
All I had to do was pick it up

42
00:01:46,673 --> 00:01:49,005
and open it. But because
he didn't have that look...

43
00:01:49,042 --> 00:01:52,102
and come on, I didn't even
know what the look was.

44
00:01:52,145 --> 00:01:54,705
- But I just figured...
- There is no look.

45
00:01:54,747 --> 00:01:56,874
Exactly. Exactly.

46
00:01:56,916 --> 00:01:58,941
A lot of women
and a lot of men

47
00:01:58,985 --> 00:02:01,317
they figure, "Well,
the people I've been with,

48
00:02:01,354 --> 00:02:03,345
- all of them is clean."
- They look clean.

49
00:02:03,389 --> 00:02:05,550
Yeah, that "Everybody
I messed with, they was clean."

50
00:02:05,592 --> 00:02:07,389
- That's what I used to say.
- And I'm saying, so...

51
00:02:07,427 --> 00:02:08,792
- Really?
...what that mean?

52
00:02:08,828 --> 00:02:11,922
I know, right?
Right? I tried.

53
00:03:03,716 --> 00:03:05,547
Ma, I can't find my sneakers.

54
00:03:05,585 --> 00:03:07,815
They're probably under
the bed where you left them.

55
00:03:07,854 --> 00:03:09,845
Don't make me come show you.

56
00:03:17,797 --> 00:03:19,128
Under the bed, baby.

57
00:03:19,165 --> 00:03:21,292
Good morning, this is WVKS,

58
00:03:21,334 --> 00:03:23,700
the voice
of Brooklyn speaking...

59
00:03:23,736 --> 00:03:25,499
Is that you making
all that noise, Slick?

60
00:03:25,538 --> 00:03:27,597
Yeah. I love you too, baby.

61
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:29,437
Aw.

62
00:03:29,475 --> 00:03:31,602
- Thank you for my foot rub.
- Mmm.

63
00:03:31,644 --> 00:03:33,043
I couldn't sleep for shit.

64
00:03:33,079 --> 00:03:35,013
Are you gonna stay off it today?

65
00:03:35,048 --> 00:03:37,642
I will try.
I'll take the bus for sure.

66
00:03:37,684 --> 00:03:40,244
- I'm gonna know if you're lying.
- You don't forget

67
00:03:40,286 --> 00:03:41,753
your belt today.
And make two of them sandwiches.

68
00:03:41,788 --> 00:03:43,346
- She needs two.
- Oh yeah?

69
00:03:43,389 --> 00:03:46,187
Anything else I can
do for you this morning?

70
00:03:46,226 --> 00:03:48,319
Give me the winning lotto number.

71
00:03:48,361 --> 00:03:50,226
Ah. I'll get right on that.

72
00:04:04,711 --> 00:04:06,975
Kim, you better be
almost ready.

73
00:04:07,013 --> 00:04:08,947
And I want
those teeth brushed,

74
00:04:08,982 --> 00:04:10,176
and no food
on that face, either.

75
00:04:10,216 --> 00:04:11,410
Okay.

76
00:04:14,254 --> 00:04:16,279
You want a sandwich?

77
00:04:16,322 --> 00:04:17,949
No, I'm good.

78
00:04:32,572 --> 00:04:34,597
You are stubborn.

79
00:04:34,641 --> 00:04:37,075
You know you're supposed
to eat before you take that.

80
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:39,135
- Fine. Make me a sandwich.
- Good.

81
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:44,011
I found them.

82
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:46,382
Princess Kim.

83
00:04:46,419 --> 00:04:48,683
Don't you look nice.

84
00:04:48,721 --> 00:04:50,689
- Are you taking me to school today?
- No, your mama's feet hurt,

85
00:04:50,723 --> 00:04:52,190
so I'm gonna drop you off
on my way to work.

86
00:04:52,225 --> 00:04:53,715
No, Slick. I want to.

87
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:56,388
And I'm ready, so give
your daddy a kiss goodbye.

88
00:04:56,429 --> 00:04:58,897
- Come on. Let's get a move on.
- Bye.

89
00:04:58,931 --> 00:05:00,592
Bye, baby.

90
00:05:00,633 --> 00:05:02,567
All right,
put these away for me.

91
00:05:02,602 --> 00:05:04,661
- After you take yours?
- Yeah.

92
00:05:04,704 --> 00:05:05,830
All right. I love you.

93
00:05:05,872 --> 00:05:06,998
- Have a good day.
- I love you too. Be good.

94
00:05:11,377 --> 00:05:13,277
Take care of yourself.

95
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:19,477
There goes your little
boyfriend showing off for you.

96
00:05:19,519 --> 00:05:21,146
He's not my boyfriend.

97
00:05:21,187 --> 00:05:24,054
- If you say you like him...
- He's too young for me anyway.

98
00:05:24,090 --> 00:05:25,523
He is definitely
too young for you.

99
00:05:25,558 --> 00:05:27,389
All right. Now listen.

100
00:05:27,427 --> 00:05:29,190
I don't care what the rules are.

101
00:05:29,228 --> 00:05:31,196
If you get hungry in the afternoon,
I want you to take out

102
00:05:31,230 --> 00:05:32,925
that extra sandwich
your father made you and eat it.

103
00:05:32,965 --> 00:05:35,092
And if they say something,
you tell them to call me.

104
00:05:35,134 --> 00:05:37,068
- Okay okay.
- Ah. Hey.

105
00:05:37,103 --> 00:05:38,968
- Love you.
- Love you too.

106
00:05:39,005 --> 00:05:40,302
- Have a good day.
- You too.

107
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:41,671
- Bye. Be good.
- Bye.

108
00:05:44,477 --> 00:05:47,105
Kelly. Kelly.

109
00:05:48,181 --> 00:05:49,910
Kelly!

110
00:05:49,949 --> 00:05:51,814
Come on, girl. Get yourself up
and go to school. I gotta go.

111
00:05:51,851 --> 00:05:53,443
Okay.

112
00:05:55,088 --> 00:05:58,285
- Bye. Be good.
- I love you, Grandma.

113
00:05:58,324 --> 00:06:00,189
Love you too.

114
00:06:58,418 --> 00:07:01,012
Oh shit.
Amare, what the fuck?

115
00:07:01,053 --> 00:07:02,611
I believe... come on.

116
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:04,885
- Did my grandma see you?
- Nah.

117
00:07:04,924 --> 00:07:07,484
I waited till she left
so it wouldn't be no drama.

118
00:07:12,398 --> 00:07:14,229
I've been up all night.

119
00:07:14,267 --> 00:07:16,167
Yeah, no shit.
You smell like an ashtray.

120
00:07:20,273 --> 00:07:22,605
Look at you with them cornrows.
When did you get them done?

121
00:07:22,642 --> 00:07:24,132
I don't know.
Like a couple of days ago.

122
00:07:24,177 --> 00:07:25,576
What's his name?

123
00:07:25,611 --> 00:07:27,806
Why it always gotta
be about some guy?

124
00:07:30,883 --> 00:07:33,477
Marcus.

125
00:07:35,354 --> 00:07:38,687
What happened?
Your sister kicked you out?

126
00:07:38,724 --> 00:07:40,817
Yeah, Tanya is
not feeling me right now.

127
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:43,294
Fuck her and that bitch-ass
garbage man nigger

128
00:07:43,329 --> 00:07:45,229
she married, you know?

129
00:08:02,248 --> 00:08:04,944
You all right?

130
00:08:04,984 --> 00:08:07,612
Yeah.

131
00:08:09,822 --> 00:08:11,346
Hey...

132
00:08:11,390 --> 00:08:13,358
I could stay with you?

133
00:08:16,028 --> 00:08:17,962
Yeah yeah.

134
00:08:17,997 --> 00:08:20,124
You can be here as long
as my grandma don't catch you.

135
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:23,329
Baby, your grandma needs
to learn how to forgive and forget.

136
00:08:26,339 --> 00:08:28,068
Take off your shoes, fool.

137
00:08:28,107 --> 00:08:29,768
And plea... ugh.

138
00:08:29,809 --> 00:08:31,834
Please take a shower
before you leave here.

139
00:08:31,878 --> 00:08:34,608
That is so nasty. Ugh.

140
00:08:34,647 --> 00:08:38,048
Your bed feels like
the Four Seasons or some shit.

141
00:08:38,084 --> 00:08:40,450
You need anything before I go?

142
00:08:40,486 --> 00:08:43,216
No. I'm just gonna
stay a couple of days,

143
00:08:43,256 --> 00:08:45,816
you know, until I can
get back up with Michael.

144
00:08:45,858 --> 00:08:47,325
Michael?
What happened to Louis?

145
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:48,952
Man, that was last month.

146
00:08:48,995 --> 00:08:50,792
You gotta keep up, girl. Come on.

147
00:08:50,830 --> 00:08:53,025
Okay. Whatever.

148
00:09:26,165 --> 00:09:28,998
What's up?
You know who it is. Holler.

149
00:09:29,035 --> 00:09:31,629
Hey, Kelly.
It's your mother.

150
00:09:31,671 --> 00:09:33,969
I picked up some new DVDs.

151
00:09:34,006 --> 00:09:35,906
I got that Chris Tucker movie

152
00:09:35,942 --> 00:09:38,604
and... I don't know, something else
that ain't even come out yet.

153
00:09:38,644 --> 00:09:41,875
Anyway, I'll see you
at dinner tonight, all right? Bye.

154
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:51,017
We have to talk
about some funding, ladies.

155
00:09:51,057 --> 00:09:53,025
We really need to make
sure that every time

156
00:09:53,059 --> 00:09:54,617
we are at a site
or at a meeting

157
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:56,321
or at a forum
or what have you,

158
00:09:56,362 --> 00:09:59,525
that anybody that you're talking to,
that you are referring to anyplace

159
00:09:59,565 --> 00:10:02,898
for testing, counseling,
what have you, support group...

160
00:10:02,935 --> 00:10:04,698
make sure you get those
stat sheets filled out

161
00:10:04,737 --> 00:10:06,796
so we can hand them in
and we can get paid.

162
00:10:06,839 --> 00:10:08,204
And we keep on doing
what we're doing.

163
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:10,140
Okay. The female condom, girls.

164
00:10:10,176 --> 00:10:12,974
If we're teaching women
how to take care of themselves,

165
00:10:13,012 --> 00:10:14,343
then they gotta
take care of themselves.

166
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:16,371
I have such a hard time

167
00:10:16,415 --> 00:10:19,213
getting our young sisters
to just even try it.

168
00:10:19,251 --> 00:10:21,276
They like, "What's that?
I don't like it.

169
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:23,185
- I don't think it's gonna feel good."
- Yeah.

170
00:10:23,222 --> 00:10:24,985
I say, "Well, listen.
This will put you in control

171
00:10:25,024 --> 00:10:27,959
of protecting yourself
and your own sexuality..."

172
00:10:27,994 --> 00:10:29,962
But a lot of the older
women don't know about

173
00:10:29,996 --> 00:10:32,021
Reality and female condoms.

174
00:10:32,064 --> 00:10:33,759
- Right.
- They never heard of 'em.

175
00:10:33,799 --> 00:10:36,199
The Muslim women, they'll
take the Reality before they take...

176
00:10:36,235 --> 00:10:38,260
and I don't know, maybe it has
something to do with their husband...

177
00:10:38,304 --> 00:10:41,239
they get questioned
less with the female condom

178
00:10:41,273 --> 00:10:43,298
- than they would with a male condom.
- Sure.

179
00:10:43,342 --> 00:10:45,606
You could always tell them
that they can put that on eight hours

180
00:10:45,645 --> 00:10:49,274
- before their partner get there.
- I think that's a good

181
00:10:49,315 --> 00:10:50,942
little key right there.
We gotta definitely

182
00:10:50,983 --> 00:10:53,383
let them know that they
can wear it for a while.

183
00:10:53,419 --> 00:10:55,546
You know what I mean? Because...

184
00:10:55,588 --> 00:10:57,351
before you go to the club...

185
00:10:57,390 --> 00:11:00,655
- Oh my god.
- I mean, that's what it is. If...

186
00:11:00,693 --> 00:11:02,058
- That's right.
- If you're planning

187
00:11:02,094 --> 00:11:03,425
on getting down like that...

188
00:11:03,462 --> 00:11:05,692
I can order
the vagina demonstrator.

189
00:11:05,731 --> 00:11:08,700
And we can use that to take
it out into the field with us.

190
00:11:08,734 --> 00:11:11,532
- I think you should order that.
- It's okay to invoice.

191
00:11:11,570 --> 00:11:14,004
- It's done.
- I think the quicker we can use it,

192
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:16,372
- show 'em how easy it is to do...
- Right. Yeah.

193
00:11:16,409 --> 00:11:18,877
...it will make it as simple
as putting on a condom

194
00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:20,071
in their minds,
you know what I mean?

195
00:11:20,112 --> 00:11:22,512
That was great today.

196
00:11:22,548 --> 00:11:25,278
- Good turn out.
- Good morning, this is Life Support.

197
00:11:25,317 --> 00:11:27,785
Deyah just walked in.
Got a couple of minutes?

198
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:29,219
She was asking for you.

199
00:11:29,255 --> 00:11:30,916
Yeah, sure I do.

200
00:11:32,458 --> 00:11:33,891
Deyah...

201
00:11:33,926 --> 00:11:36,087
you want a chance
at having an healthy child,

202
00:11:36,128 --> 00:11:38,756
you gotta keep taking the AZT.

203
00:11:38,798 --> 00:11:40,766
And going back
to the hills of Jamaica

204
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:43,064
to see the Obeah man,
that ain't the answer.

205
00:11:43,102 --> 00:11:46,162
Listen now. There is there a herb
that might make the virus go away.

206
00:11:46,205 --> 00:11:48,730
Don't you think we'd all be
in Jamaica if that was the truth?

207
00:11:48,774 --> 00:11:51,607
Can't nothing make
this virus go away.

208
00:11:51,644 --> 00:11:53,874
Now look,
you saw my daughter.

209
00:11:53,913 --> 00:11:56,848
I was HIV positive
when I had her.

210
00:11:56,882 --> 00:11:59,908
She's nine
and she's HIV negative.

211
00:11:59,952 --> 00:12:02,147
And there's almost
no way in hell

212
00:12:02,188 --> 00:12:04,816
she would even be here
if I wasn't clean and sober

213
00:12:04,857 --> 00:12:06,791
and taking AZT

214
00:12:06,826 --> 00:12:08,657
when I was pregnant.

215
00:12:08,694 --> 00:12:10,924
You go ahead and take
all the herbs you want.

216
00:12:10,963 --> 00:12:14,592
But that baby...
that baby needs medicine.

217
00:12:16,535 --> 00:12:20,437
What about your husband?
Is he going to Jamaica with you?

218
00:12:20,473 --> 00:12:24,273
- Good morning, Life Support.
- You haven't told him yet.

219
00:12:24,310 --> 00:12:25,777
No.

220
00:12:25,811 --> 00:12:28,712
He's not gonna want
to hear about no HIV.

221
00:12:28,748 --> 00:12:32,081
I can't tell him, Ana.

222
00:12:34,286 --> 00:12:36,379
You don't understand.

223
00:12:38,491 --> 00:12:41,085
Why haven't you told him?
Are you... I mean...

224
00:12:41,127 --> 00:12:43,891
you're worried, you think he's going
to get violent with you or something?

225
00:12:46,799 --> 00:12:47,891
No.

226
00:12:47,933 --> 00:12:49,798
Then you need to tell him.

227
00:12:49,835 --> 00:12:52,360
Look, I ain't going to lie.

228
00:12:52,404 --> 00:12:55,805
When Slick told me
he had the virus,

229
00:12:55,841 --> 00:12:57,502
I wanted to kill him.

230
00:12:57,543 --> 00:12:59,511
I mean,
we were struggling.

231
00:12:59,545 --> 00:13:00,807
He was in jail.

232
00:13:00,846 --> 00:13:02,473
I was still getting high.

233
00:13:04,049 --> 00:13:07,280
Had already lost custody
of one daughter 'cause of the drugs.

234
00:13:09,855 --> 00:13:11,948
I mean, it was a hell
of a wake-up call,

235
00:13:11,991 --> 00:13:13,959
but him telling me

236
00:13:13,993 --> 00:13:16,154
actually saved my life

237
00:13:16,195 --> 00:13:18,186
and my family.

238
00:13:19,765 --> 00:13:21,528
Just think about it.

239
00:13:21,567 --> 00:13:24,195
You're stronger
than you think, girl.

240
00:13:24,236 --> 00:13:26,670
No...

241
00:13:40,586 --> 00:13:42,213
Amare!

242
00:13:43,322 --> 00:13:47,418
Amare.
Amare.

243
00:13:47,459 --> 00:13:50,121
Amare. Amare!

244
00:13:50,162 --> 00:13:52,130
Amare, wake up!

245
00:13:52,164 --> 00:13:54,826
Amare! Wake up.

246
00:13:56,602 --> 00:13:57,830
Are you all right?

247
00:13:59,405 --> 00:14:00,997
You need me to take
you to the hospital?

248
00:14:04,877 --> 00:14:08,369
- I just fell asleep. Or something.
- Right.

249
00:14:08,414 --> 00:14:09,779
You fell asleep?

250
00:14:09,815 --> 00:14:11,282
Amare, you can't
smoke in here.

251
00:14:11,317 --> 00:14:13,342
Oh yeah, right. Sorry.

252
00:14:16,956 --> 00:14:18,617
Amare, look at me.

253
00:14:18,657 --> 00:14:21,057
Are you sick
or are you high?

254
00:14:23,028 --> 00:14:25,326
Forget it.
It doesn't even matter.

255
00:14:25,364 --> 00:14:26,592
If you don't take care of yourself,

256
00:14:26,632 --> 00:14:28,827
you're gonna end up
in the hospital again.

257
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:30,631
I'm taking my meds, I'm just...

258
00:14:30,669 --> 00:14:32,762
they just...
they make me sleepy is all.

259
00:14:32,805 --> 00:14:36,536
Amare, don't play me.
You think I don't know about meds?

260
00:14:36,575 --> 00:14:37,940
Well, I know you know.

261
00:14:37,977 --> 00:14:40,605
You're a smart schoolgirl.
You know lots of stuff.

262
00:14:40,646 --> 00:14:42,705
Yeah, well, fuck you.

263
00:14:50,222 --> 00:14:51,780
What do you want from me?

264
00:14:53,025 --> 00:14:55,186
Am I supposed
to be like you,

265
00:14:55,227 --> 00:14:57,957
with your big house

266
00:14:57,997 --> 00:15:00,591
and your big old grandma
keeping you safe from harm and shit?

267
00:15:00,633 --> 00:15:02,965
You're gonna throw
that in my face?

268
00:15:05,704 --> 00:15:07,797
Nah, well I wouldn't do that.

269
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:11,037
Come on.
You know it's been me and you

270
00:15:11,076 --> 00:15:12,941
since my parents died.

271
00:15:12,978 --> 00:15:15,879
Come on, now.

272
00:15:17,983 --> 00:15:21,111
- Come on. Leave me alone.
- You can't smoke in the house,

273
00:15:21,153 --> 00:15:23,144
Amare. Damn it.

274
00:15:55,354 --> 00:15:57,549
Did you talk to Michael?

275
00:15:57,589 --> 00:16:00,149
Yeah. We're gonna get up soon,
so it's all good.

276
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:03,726
Well, what are you
gonna do now?

277
00:16:03,762 --> 00:16:06,322
'Cause I got
a lot of homework to do.

278
00:16:09,201 --> 00:16:10,634
Okay.

279
00:16:12,104 --> 00:16:15,540
Hey... your... your grandma
is coming home soon?

280
00:16:15,574 --> 00:16:17,838
Yeah.

281
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:24,513
There's a lot of stuff
I gotta get done anyway, so...

282
00:16:36,028 --> 00:16:37,188
Amare.

283
00:16:42,534 --> 00:16:44,195
Why don't you
give me a call later

284
00:16:44,236 --> 00:16:47,330
and we'll figure out
about tonight, all right?

285
00:16:50,342 --> 00:16:52,173
Yeah.

286
00:16:52,211 --> 00:16:54,839
Tonight. Later.

287
00:17:10,429 --> 00:17:12,556
All the little girls
like Chris Brown.

288
00:17:12,598 --> 00:17:14,828
And I think he's cute too.

289
00:17:14,867 --> 00:17:16,562
I have him
on my notebook.

290
00:17:18,504 --> 00:17:20,472
Look at her.

291
00:17:20,506 --> 00:17:22,303
Doesn't she kind of look
like your sister?

292
00:17:22,341 --> 00:17:23,638
Except she's 6'-3".

293
00:17:23,675 --> 00:17:25,199
Mm-hmm.

294
00:17:25,244 --> 00:17:27,303
You know I'm gonna be 6'-3".

295
00:17:28,614 --> 00:17:30,912
You just might be.

296
00:17:30,949 --> 00:17:32,917
Do you wanna go
to a basketball game sometime?

297
00:17:32,951 --> 00:17:35,181
Yeah, I'd love
to go to a game.

298
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:37,586
You know what?
You should ask your sister

299
00:17:37,623 --> 00:17:39,215
if she wanna
come with us.

300
00:17:39,258 --> 00:17:41,283
I bet you she'd
wanna come if you invited her.

301
00:17:41,326 --> 00:17:44,261
- Okay. I think she'd really like that.
- Right.

302
00:17:45,597 --> 00:17:47,497
On top of that,
the school is so overcrowded

303
00:17:47,533 --> 00:17:49,501
they got them eating lunch
at 10:00 in the morning.

304
00:17:49,535 --> 00:17:51,435
She ain't hungry
at no 10:00.

305
00:17:51,470 --> 00:17:53,165
And how she's supposed
to learn anything

306
00:17:53,205 --> 00:17:55,765
if she's sitting in class half the day
on an empty stomach?

307
00:17:55,808 --> 00:17:57,639
Well, sounds like you're on it.

308
00:17:57,676 --> 00:17:59,507
What's that supposed to mean?

309
00:18:01,213 --> 00:18:03,340
Just what I said.
You're good with Kim.

310
00:18:03,382 --> 00:18:04,849
It's good you're so involved.

311
00:18:06,485 --> 00:18:08,953
Anyway, I brought her
some snacks for later.

312
00:18:08,987 --> 00:18:10,784
And I got a kitchen full of food.

313
00:18:10,823 --> 00:18:13,587
We do this every Friday.
Every Friday I tell you the same thing.

314
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:16,457
No, it's no bother.

315
00:18:20,032 --> 00:18:22,227
- Hey, Miss Kelly.
- Hi, Mom.

316
00:18:26,004 --> 00:18:28,131
Hey. These are for you.

317
00:18:28,173 --> 00:18:31,404
- Did you get my message?
- Yeah, thanks.

318
00:18:34,446 --> 00:18:37,438
- What?
- You wanna keep your hair like that?

319
00:18:37,483 --> 00:18:39,815
I mean, I like it.
I'm just saying, you know,

320
00:18:39,852 --> 00:18:42,150
you play basketball
and girls might get a little...

321
00:18:42,187 --> 00:18:43,984
Mom, I'm gonna keep
my hair like this, all right?

322
00:18:44,022 --> 00:18:45,819
All right.

323
00:18:45,858 --> 00:18:48,326
Girls might try
and test you, though.

324
00:18:50,062 --> 00:18:51,120
It's all I'm saying, you know...

325
00:18:52,331 --> 00:18:53,798
Okay.
Okay.

326
00:18:56,702 --> 00:18:59,796
- I like it. It's tight.
- Thank you, Kim.

327
00:19:02,007 --> 00:19:05,568
So, you all gonna watch
the Liberty game tonight?

328
00:19:05,611 --> 00:19:08,273
- Oh yeah.
- Kim wants to ask you something.

329
00:19:08,313 --> 00:19:10,838
What's up?

330
00:19:10,883 --> 00:19:12,646
About the game.

331
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:17,452
I really want you
to take me to the Liberty game.

332
00:19:17,489 --> 00:19:19,389
- Can we go?
- Of course we can go.

333
00:19:19,424 --> 00:19:21,392
That would be fun me...
and you at the Liberty game,

334
00:19:21,426 --> 00:19:23,394
all the way in Manhattan
on Friday night?

335
00:19:23,428 --> 00:19:24,895
They play the Sparks
on the 10th.

336
00:19:24,930 --> 00:19:27,160
Life Support got
a whole block of tickets.

337
00:19:27,199 --> 00:19:28,723
But if we wanna go,
we gotta sign up soon,

338
00:19:28,767 --> 00:19:30,029
because, you know, the tickets
are gonna go soon...

339
00:19:30,068 --> 00:19:31,626
Wait, so now
we're all gonna go?

340
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:33,831
Well, I thought
it'd be fun.

341
00:19:33,872 --> 00:19:35,305
You know?
A little girls' night out.

342
00:19:36,542 --> 00:19:40,103
You better check out
where those seats are.

343
00:19:40,145 --> 00:19:42,739
Yeah, last time I got
a nosebleed sitting in them seats.

344
00:19:44,516 --> 00:19:46,381
We got binoculars.

345
00:19:46,418 --> 00:19:48,613
It's a good thing,
'cause you're gonna need them

346
00:19:48,654 --> 00:19:50,315
up there in those bleachers.

347
00:19:52,758 --> 00:19:54,316
You should have heard
her talking about

348
00:19:54,359 --> 00:19:56,793
"Oh, so now we're all gonna go?"

349
00:19:56,828 --> 00:19:59,422
With that old snotty-ass voice
she uses now.

350
00:19:59,464 --> 00:20:00,931
What snotty-ass voice?

351
00:20:00,966 --> 00:20:03,833
The one that says
"You don't know shit."

352
00:20:03,869 --> 00:20:06,360
I seem to remember
somebody else being the same way,

353
00:20:06,405 --> 00:20:08,635
walking around
in those dungarees

354
00:20:08,674 --> 00:20:10,733
talking about,
"What you need my number for?

355
00:20:10,776 --> 00:20:13,006
- What you're gonna do with it?"
- Whatever. We're not talkin' about me.

356
00:20:13,045 --> 00:20:15,070
Yeah, but you were
just like them sometimes.

357
00:20:15,113 --> 00:20:17,946
- Them who?
- Kelly and your moms.

358
00:20:17,983 --> 00:20:20,474
You're always making
excuses for them, Slick.

359
00:20:20,519 --> 00:20:22,646
- No, I don't.
- Yes, you do.

360
00:20:22,688 --> 00:20:24,679
You don't even
know Kelly like that.

361
00:20:24,723 --> 00:20:26,384
I mean...

362
00:20:26,425 --> 00:20:28,290
barely.

363
00:20:28,327 --> 00:20:30,591
I don't know what
you want me to say, Ana.

364
00:20:30,629 --> 00:20:32,824
I know it's rough with y'all,

365
00:20:32,864 --> 00:20:34,456
Kelly acting the way she does,

366
00:20:34,499 --> 00:20:36,990
- but you're in it too.
- What is that supposed to mean?

367
00:20:37,035 --> 00:20:38,798
That means you need to chill out.

368
00:20:38,837 --> 00:20:41,601
She's a teenage girl. It doesn't
matter whose roof she's living under.

369
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:44,268
She doesn't wanna be seen
out in public with her mother.

370
00:20:44,309 --> 00:20:45,606
It's a fact of life.

371
00:20:45,644 --> 00:20:47,475
Well, maybe that's
your fact of life.

372
00:20:47,512 --> 00:20:51,209
You hid your moms
till we were damn near married.

373
00:20:53,885 --> 00:20:55,910
That's 'cause I ain't wanted
my moms to hurt you.

374
00:21:00,392 --> 00:21:02,360
Oh, man.

375
00:21:02,394 --> 00:21:04,589
But baby,
you know the rap.

376
00:21:04,630 --> 00:21:06,495
People are not going to change
until they're ready.

377
00:21:09,668 --> 00:21:11,795
So what you want me
to do, stop trying?

378
00:21:13,538 --> 00:21:15,472
Uh-uh.

379
00:21:17,442 --> 00:21:19,205
What I wanna do...

380
00:21:24,516 --> 00:21:26,006
is go to bed.

381
00:21:27,185 --> 00:21:29,176
Come on.

382
00:21:57,249 --> 00:21:59,217
I gotta chill out.

383
00:22:05,924 --> 00:22:07,915
Yeah.

384
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:12,456
Well, I met someone.

385
00:22:12,497 --> 00:22:14,260
Okay. Okay.

386
00:22:14,299 --> 00:22:16,927
But I can't... I haven't
told him yet and I can't tell him.

387
00:22:16,968 --> 00:22:20,768
Yet.

388
00:22:20,806 --> 00:22:23,274
But l... I've decided that...

389
00:22:25,143 --> 00:22:26,610
I'm going to this weekend.

390
00:22:26,645 --> 00:22:29,045
But it's that thing
of, you know...

391
00:22:29,081 --> 00:22:31,140
- When to tell, how to tell?
- Yeah. How to tell?

392
00:22:31,183 --> 00:22:33,208
- Do you kiss first and tell?
- I know, I know.

393
00:22:33,251 --> 00:22:34,912
- I know, I know, sometimes...
- Do you shake hands and tell?

394
00:22:34,953 --> 00:22:37,513
Do you hug? I mean, you know,
it's that... that scary part

395
00:22:37,556 --> 00:22:38,989
of when to tell.

396
00:22:39,024 --> 00:22:41,549
Sometimes, they, you know...

397
00:22:41,593 --> 00:22:44,255
- I mean, rejection is hard.
- Yes it is.

398
00:22:44,296 --> 00:22:47,026
They walk out the door.
You know you'll never hear from him.

399
00:22:47,065 --> 00:22:48,862
They're never gonna call you.

400
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:51,994
And then some ask you for
the condoms and a dental dam.

401
00:22:52,037 --> 00:22:54,437
"Go get it. Let's use it."

402
00:22:54,473 --> 00:22:56,168
It could go either way.

403
00:22:56,208 --> 00:22:58,472
My thing was just
to come straight out and tell him.

404
00:22:58,510 --> 00:23:00,478
- Yeah.
- You know? From the very beginning.

405
00:23:00,512 --> 00:23:02,139
"I'm HIV positive."

406
00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:04,114
You know?
"What you wanna do?"

407
00:23:04,149 --> 00:23:08,017
- I love that.
- I got some really crazy responses.

408
00:23:08,053 --> 00:23:10,647
- Yeah.
- "I don't care. I use two condoms."

409
00:23:10,689 --> 00:23:13,453
"I don't think I can have
sex with you," he said,

410
00:23:13,492 --> 00:23:15,187
"but I can eat
your pussy, right?"

411
00:23:15,227 --> 00:23:16,819
- Oh my god!
- I was like...

412
00:23:16,862 --> 00:23:17,954
"Hell yeah!"

413
00:23:19,498 --> 00:23:21,329
Me and my partner...

414
00:23:21,366 --> 00:23:24,733
he's really not into using condoms.

415
00:23:24,770 --> 00:23:27,898
But if we have unprotected sex,

416
00:23:27,939 --> 00:23:29,998
I mean, let alone

417
00:23:30,041 --> 00:23:32,134
a pregnancy at my age...

418
00:23:32,177 --> 00:23:34,805
but I don't want
another strain of the virus.

419
00:23:34,846 --> 00:23:38,043
But he says that he can't
feel anything, I mean...

420
00:23:38,083 --> 00:23:39,983
and actually, ladies,

421
00:23:40,018 --> 00:23:42,350
- he kind of shrivels up when I say...
- Right.

422
00:23:42,387 --> 00:23:43,615
..."Let's use the condom."
- Have you ever tried putting

423
00:23:43,655 --> 00:23:45,646
the condom on with your mouth?

424
00:23:45,690 --> 00:23:48,022
- Girl, how you do that?
- Easy.

425
00:23:48,059 --> 00:23:50,687
And it'll get him excited.
I don't think he'd shrivel up so much.

426
00:23:50,729 --> 00:23:52,594
But no, seriously...

427
00:24:30,368 --> 00:24:33,895
The number you've dialed
is temporarily not in service.

428
00:25:08,206 --> 00:25:10,401
Simon, right?

429
00:25:10,442 --> 00:25:13,605
- Yeah?
- I'm Kelly. Amare's friend.

430
00:25:13,645 --> 00:25:15,442
Okay. How are you doing?

431
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:18,813
I'm good. I'm looking for Amare.
Have you seen him?

432
00:25:18,850 --> 00:25:20,112
Yeah, I've seen him.

433
00:25:20,151 --> 00:25:21,914
He was acting
all stuck-up as usual.

434
00:25:21,953 --> 00:25:25,047
- When was this?
- A couple of days ago.

435
00:25:25,090 --> 00:25:28,548
Said him and his daddy been
drinking Cristal at some fancy hotel.

436
00:25:28,593 --> 00:25:30,959
Wait, you're not talking
about Michael, are you?

437
00:25:30,996 --> 00:25:32,327
I don't know his name.

438
00:25:32,364 --> 00:25:34,127
Owns some recording studio...
"Hatlantic" something.

439
00:25:34,165 --> 00:25:36,531
All right. Thanks.

440
00:26:30,221 --> 00:26:32,348
Bring that back.

441
00:26:32,390 --> 00:26:35,359
It's hot right there
but it's missing something.

442
00:26:35,393 --> 00:26:38,521
Take it back to the break.
You could still use more punch.

443
00:26:39,664 --> 00:26:41,063
What's up?
Can I help you?

444
00:26:41,099 --> 00:26:42,964
Yeah, I'm looking
for Michael Johnson.

445
00:26:44,336 --> 00:26:46,531
That might be me. It depends.
Who am I talking to?

446
00:26:46,571 --> 00:26:48,334
I'm friends with Amare.

447
00:26:48,373 --> 00:26:49,738
My name is Kelly.

448
00:26:49,774 --> 00:26:52,868
- Amare?
- Yeah. He told me about you.

449
00:26:52,911 --> 00:26:54,708
I'm just...
I'm just looking for him.

450
00:26:54,746 --> 00:26:58,011
Yeah yeah yeah.
I know who you're talking about.

451
00:26:58,049 --> 00:26:59,641
- Fix that. Fix that.
- Word up, man.

452
00:26:59,684 --> 00:27:01,743
Come on, let's talk out here.

453
00:27:05,490 --> 00:27:07,481
It's all good.
So, I'm saying, where...

454
00:27:09,527 --> 00:27:11,119
- Oh.
- Now, what did you come over here for?

455
00:27:11,162 --> 00:27:13,221
L... I just came over
here looking for Amare.

456
00:27:13,264 --> 00:27:14,822
I just wanna make
sure he's all right.

457
00:27:14,866 --> 00:27:16,390
Well, he was passing out
flyers for me

458
00:27:16,434 --> 00:27:18,095
a couple of days ago.
He seemed fine to me.

459
00:27:18,136 --> 00:27:21,003
Well, has he been
staying with you?

460
00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:22,563
- Staying with me?
- Yeah.

461
00:27:22,607 --> 00:27:24,905
What are you talking about?
I barely know him.

462
00:27:24,943 --> 00:27:26,274
No, wait a minute.
What are you talking about?

463
00:27:26,311 --> 00:27:29,747
- I thought you were his boyfriend.
- Now are you deaf, dumb or blind?

464
00:27:29,781 --> 00:27:31,578
I got a wife
and three kids.

465
00:27:31,616 --> 00:27:34,312
Now I think you got me
confused with somebody else.

466
00:27:34,352 --> 00:27:37,549
Now he works for me
off and on, but that's it.

467
00:27:39,124 --> 00:27:40,751
Yo, man.
Are we gonna do this?

468
00:27:42,093 --> 00:27:44,186
What did you say your
name was again, baby?

469
00:27:44,229 --> 00:27:47,062
Now, fellas, you think baby's bad
enough to be in our music video?

470
00:27:47,098 --> 00:27:48,998
- Oh, no doubt.
- She looks like

471
00:27:49,034 --> 00:27:50,558
- she can drop it like it's hot.
- Yeah.

472
00:28:03,982 --> 00:28:06,314
HIV is the leading
cause of death

473
00:28:06,351 --> 00:28:09,752
for black women
ages 25 to 34...

474
00:28:09,788 --> 00:28:13,087
the leading cause.
And if your man just came out of prison,

475
00:28:13,124 --> 00:28:16,287
get him tested. You don't know
what he's doing in there.

476
00:28:16,327 --> 00:28:17,988
All you know is what he tells you.

477
00:28:18,029 --> 00:28:19,428
Carlos isn't gonna
take no test.

478
00:28:19,464 --> 00:28:21,762
Well, then you need
to kick Carlos to the curb.

479
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:24,291
In the meantime,
get him to wear one of these.

480
00:28:24,335 --> 00:28:25,825
I hate jimmy hats.

481
00:28:25,870 --> 00:28:27,804
Well, then I hope
you like taking pills.

482
00:28:27,839 --> 00:28:29,807
Because once you get this virus

483
00:28:29,841 --> 00:28:32,833
you're gonna be taking
about 12 of them bad boys a day.

484
00:28:32,877 --> 00:28:35,004
See? I know my man
ain't got AIDS.

485
00:28:35,046 --> 00:28:37,810
- How do you know?
- 'Cause he ain't getting nasty

486
00:28:37,849 --> 00:28:40,181
with no faggots
behind my back.

487
00:28:40,218 --> 00:28:41,446
He loves my pussy.

488
00:28:42,787 --> 00:28:44,880
Yeah, well, that might be true,

489
00:28:44,923 --> 00:28:47,221
but that don't mean
he ain't creeping around.

490
00:28:47,258 --> 00:28:48,782
Just ask Terry McMillan.

491
00:28:48,827 --> 00:28:52,661
Now I've been living
with this virus for 10 years.

492
00:28:52,697 --> 00:28:55,393
And no, my husband wasn't
creeping around with some other men...

493
00:28:55,433 --> 00:28:58,095
or women.
He was shooting cocaine.

494
00:28:58,136 --> 00:29:00,570
And so was I.

495
00:29:00,605 --> 00:29:04,041
Now maybe I don't have
no excuse, but after this moment

496
00:29:04,075 --> 00:29:05,565
y'all ain't got one either.

497
00:29:05,610 --> 00:29:07,339
'Cause I'm standing here
telling you

498
00:29:07,378 --> 00:29:09,039
this disease ain't no joke.

499
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:10,638
And I'm not going to
shut up about it.

500
00:29:10,682 --> 00:29:12,707
I don't care
if y'all don't care.

501
00:29:12,751 --> 00:29:15,481
If y'all stop dying,
I'll stop talking about it.

502
00:29:16,821 --> 00:29:18,914
In the meantime...

503
00:29:20,959 --> 00:29:23,086
got to use
your head, sisters.

504
00:29:34,172 --> 00:29:36,868
Excuse me.
Can I ask you a question?

505
00:29:36,908 --> 00:29:38,205
Yeah.

506
00:29:38,243 --> 00:29:40,837
How do you suggest
I ask my man to take a test?

507
00:29:40,879 --> 00:29:43,006
I mean, I don't know
how to go about that.

508
00:29:43,047 --> 00:29:44,878
Well, tell me
a little bit about your man.

509
00:29:44,916 --> 00:29:47,111
Does he go to the doctor?
His he that kind of guy? Or does he...

510
00:29:58,930 --> 00:30:00,625
Uh, you, um...

511
00:30:06,070 --> 00:30:08,265
Hey, baby.

512
00:30:08,306 --> 00:30:10,365
We're in here.

513
00:30:14,279 --> 00:30:16,213
- Hey.
- Hey.

514
00:30:19,417 --> 00:30:21,851
So what, you decided
about the Liberty game?

515
00:30:21,886 --> 00:30:24,218
Ma, I got practice every
day and homework every night.

516
00:30:24,255 --> 00:30:26,746
Game's on Saturday.
You study on Saturdays too?

517
00:30:26,791 --> 00:30:29,351
Look, I just came over
to drop these off.

518
00:30:29,394 --> 00:30:31,123
Kim left them
at Grandma's.

519
00:30:31,162 --> 00:30:33,289
Speaking of which,
you picking her up?

520
00:30:33,331 --> 00:30:35,265
Oh shit. I gotta go.

521
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:37,131
Nice talking
to you, Kelly.

522
00:30:38,403 --> 00:30:41,201
- All right.
- Yeah, right.

523
00:30:41,239 --> 00:30:43,537
Watch the stove.
I got that sauce on low.

524
00:30:44,776 --> 00:30:47,677
- Where is Kim at?
- Gymnastics.

525
00:30:47,712 --> 00:30:49,543
New class over at BAM.

526
00:30:49,581 --> 00:30:52,880
- Mm-hmm.
- What? I took you to gymnastics.

527
00:30:52,917 --> 00:30:55,647
One class, Ma.
You forgot to pick me up.

528
00:30:57,088 --> 00:30:58,578
So how's basketball?

529
00:30:58,623 --> 00:31:00,921
First game's next week.

530
00:31:00,959 --> 00:31:02,483
All right, then.
I'll be there.

531
00:31:06,798 --> 00:31:09,289
Ma...

532
00:31:09,334 --> 00:31:12,565
Amare's sister Tanya
kicked him out.

533
00:31:12,604 --> 00:31:14,231
Are you hanging out
with Amare again?

534
00:31:14,272 --> 00:31:16,206
Ma, I'm real worried about him.

535
00:31:16,241 --> 00:31:18,573
- Because?
- Because...

536
00:31:18,610 --> 00:31:21,670
he left his meds
at the house.

537
00:31:23,114 --> 00:31:24,672
- This is not good.
- No, I know.

538
00:31:24,716 --> 00:31:26,911
So today I went by
his boyfriend's job.

539
00:31:26,951 --> 00:31:30,284
- Boyfriend?
- Yeah, some older guy named Michael.

540
00:31:30,321 --> 00:31:32,289
He's supposed to be some
record producer or something.

541
00:31:32,323 --> 00:31:34,450
He was a real asshole.

542
00:31:34,492 --> 00:31:36,187
I've been trying
to call his cell

543
00:31:36,227 --> 00:31:38,092
but his sister
must have cut it off.

544
00:31:38,129 --> 00:31:40,324
Is he getting high again?

545
00:31:40,365 --> 00:31:42,663
I don't know. Maybe.

546
00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:45,635
Well, he might
just be ignoring you.

547
00:31:45,670 --> 00:31:48,798
I mean, he might
just be getting his high on.

548
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:51,070
Oh, is that something
drug addicts do, Ma?

549
00:31:54,812 --> 00:31:57,007
I sounds like you're
asking me for help, Kelly.

550
00:31:57,048 --> 00:31:58,948
Look, Ma, maybe you could just talk
to his sister or something.

551
00:31:58,983 --> 00:32:01,645
Just help him get off the street.
He got a serious cough.

552
00:32:01,686 --> 00:32:03,950
I've never seen him this bad.

553
00:32:05,023 --> 00:32:06,490
Okay, babe.

554
00:32:06,524 --> 00:32:09,118
I'll try and help you.

555
00:32:10,895 --> 00:32:13,693
Where's Tanya working at?
Is she still over at that nursing home?

556
00:32:13,731 --> 00:32:17,167
No, she works over
at the dry cleaner on Pitkin Ave.

557
00:32:21,706 --> 00:32:23,901
All right. I gotta go.

558
00:32:28,813 --> 00:32:30,747
And... thanks.

559
00:32:40,124 --> 00:32:42,251
Call me when
you get home.

560
00:33:02,313 --> 00:33:04,577
- Tanya?
- Yes.

561
00:33:04,615 --> 00:33:06,207
It's Ana Wallace.

562
00:33:06,250 --> 00:33:08,047
I used to be friends
with your parents.

563
00:33:08,086 --> 00:33:09,348
Kelly and Amare
used to play together...

564
00:33:09,387 --> 00:33:11,378
Yeah, I know.
I know. I know who you are.

565
00:33:11,422 --> 00:33:13,515
You haven't
changed that much.

566
00:33:13,558 --> 00:33:16,186
Listen, Kelly said Amare
is in bad shape and whatever.

567
00:33:16,227 --> 00:33:18,354
So, you know,
I work for this outreach program

568
00:33:18,396 --> 00:33:22,025
and I was hoping that maybe
I could find him someplace to stay.

569
00:33:22,066 --> 00:33:23,863
Yeah, well,
if I hear from him I'll let you know.

570
00:33:23,901 --> 00:33:26,597
How is he gonna reach you
if you turned off his cell phone?

571
00:33:26,637 --> 00:33:28,298
I didn't turn off
that boy's cell phone.

572
00:33:28,339 --> 00:33:30,705
He probably lost it or sold it
or something for all I know.

573
00:33:30,742 --> 00:33:32,141
- My bad. I'm sorry.
- Who you been talking to?

574
00:33:32,176 --> 00:33:33,609
- I shouldn't have assumed.
- Uh-huh.

575
00:33:33,644 --> 00:33:35,043
We're just worried about him.

576
00:33:35,079 --> 00:33:37,570
Everybody's worried
about Amare but Amare.

577
00:33:37,615 --> 00:33:40,550
And if he is not gonna
take responsibility for himself,

578
00:33:40,585 --> 00:33:43,053
I'm not gonna be responsible
for him anymore.

579
00:33:43,087 --> 00:33:45,817
Well, do you at least
know where he might be?

580
00:33:49,327 --> 00:33:52,455
He works for a club promoter sometimes,
handing out flyers and stuff.

581
00:33:52,497 --> 00:33:53,964
What about his friends?

582
00:33:53,998 --> 00:33:55,556
He doesn't have that many.

583
00:33:58,936 --> 00:34:01,097
There is one kid
that he hangs out with,

584
00:34:01,139 --> 00:34:03,801
from the support group.
I think his name is...

585
00:34:03,841 --> 00:34:06,309
- Ness.
- Light-skinned Ness

586
00:34:06,344 --> 00:34:08,175
or Skinny Ness?

587
00:34:08,212 --> 00:34:10,180
I guess he's kind of skinny.
I don't know.

588
00:34:10,214 --> 00:34:11,647
He's always
eating up my food.

589
00:34:11,682 --> 00:34:14,014
Skinny Ness.

590
00:34:14,052 --> 00:34:16,282
What about his treatment?
Where does he go?

591
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:18,515
I don't know. Sorry.

592
00:34:18,556 --> 00:34:20,581
Do you want me to call
you if I find him?

593
00:34:20,625 --> 00:34:22,252
If you want, yeah.

594
00:34:26,664 --> 00:34:28,461
I don't hate him,
you know?

595
00:34:28,499 --> 00:34:30,990
He's my brother.
But I got my limits.

596
00:34:31,035 --> 00:34:32,935
And I'm trying
to do something here.

597
00:34:32,970 --> 00:34:35,666
I'm trying to get out
of the projects and finish my degree

598
00:34:35,706 --> 00:34:37,640
and... start a family.

599
00:34:37,675 --> 00:34:41,338
Hey, I understand.
We all gotta make our choices, right?

600
00:34:41,379 --> 00:34:43,438
- What are you trying to say?
- I'm trying to say

601
00:34:43,481 --> 00:34:46,143
if you wanna give up
one of 'em, you gotta live with it.

602
00:34:46,184 --> 00:34:48,209
Oh, so now you're
all righteous?

603
00:34:48,252 --> 00:34:49,742
Huh?

604
00:34:50,888 --> 00:34:53,083
I remember you, Ana.

605
00:34:53,124 --> 00:34:55,524
I remember you and all
y'all crackheads, uh-huh,

606
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:57,653
up in my house
with my parents.

607
00:34:57,695 --> 00:35:00,163
And y'all didn't give
a shit about us.

608
00:35:00,198 --> 00:35:03,167
I raised Amare.

609
00:35:03,201 --> 00:35:05,499
Me... all by myself.

610
00:35:05,536 --> 00:35:08,403
And I was a 13-year-old out there
in the streets stealing shit...

611
00:35:08,439 --> 00:35:11,203
diapers and wipes
and Similac and all that.

612
00:35:11,242 --> 00:35:13,767
So don't you talk to me
about making choices.

613
00:35:13,811 --> 00:35:15,972
Okay?

614
00:35:24,422 --> 00:35:28,222
"I go, Andronicus.

615
00:35:28,259 --> 00:35:31,626
O, how this villainy doth

616
00:35:31,662 --> 00:35:34,324
fat me with very

617
00:35:34,365 --> 00:35:36,196
thoughts of it.

618
00:35:36,234 --> 00:35:38,600
Let fools do good

619
00:35:38,636 --> 00:35:41,833
and fair men call
for grace.

620
00:35:41,873 --> 00:35:44,535
Aaron will have
his soul

621
00:35:44,575 --> 00:35:47,840
black like his face."

622
00:35:47,879 --> 00:35:49,744
Very good. Very good,
Jean Claude.

623
00:35:49,780 --> 00:35:52,078
You're really making
good progress.

624
00:35:52,116 --> 00:35:55,984
So, see y'all next week.
Thank you. Very good.

625
00:35:58,322 --> 00:36:00,017
Hey, Ma.

626
00:36:01,726 --> 00:36:03,489
- Give me a minute.
- Okay.

627
00:36:08,232 --> 00:36:09,529
You know,
I was thinking.

628
00:36:09,567 --> 00:36:11,865
You should come to
that Liberty game with us.

629
00:36:11,903 --> 00:36:15,339
All right, okay. I know
the seats aren't that good, all right?

630
00:36:15,373 --> 00:36:18,501
But it's really more
about the experience.

631
00:36:18,543 --> 00:36:21,376
You know, a family
outing, right?

632
00:36:21,412 --> 00:36:23,004
You sure you're
gonna want me to come

633
00:36:23,047 --> 00:36:24,912
even if Kelly
don't wanna go?

634
00:36:26,384 --> 00:36:28,818
Of course, Ma.

635
00:36:31,322 --> 00:36:33,722
What's the doctor say
about your feet?

636
00:36:33,758 --> 00:36:35,783
Stay off of 'em,
which I can't.

637
00:36:35,826 --> 00:36:37,760
What about the new painkillers?

638
00:36:37,795 --> 00:36:39,763
I threw them away.

639
00:36:39,797 --> 00:36:41,458
They gave me diarrhea

640
00:36:41,499 --> 00:36:44,491
and started giving me these
weird sores in my mouth.

641
00:36:44,535 --> 00:36:46,594
You better do what
the doctor says, Ana.

642
00:36:48,239 --> 00:36:50,264
I'm just gonna buy some new
shoes. I think that'll help.

643
00:36:52,910 --> 00:36:55,242
Something we need
to talk about.

644
00:36:55,279 --> 00:36:56,803
What?

645
00:36:59,650 --> 00:37:01,242
I'm putting the house up for sale.

646
00:37:02,820 --> 00:37:05,050
What?

647
00:37:05,089 --> 00:37:06,681
Why? Where you going?

648
00:37:06,724 --> 00:37:08,282
Back down to Virginia.

649
00:37:09,927 --> 00:37:11,326
Well, what about Kelly, though?

650
00:37:11,362 --> 00:37:13,455
She could finish
high school down there

651
00:37:13,497 --> 00:37:15,465
or she could stay with
you for another year.

652
00:37:15,499 --> 00:37:18,525
At this point, I'm tired.

653
00:37:18,569 --> 00:37:21,402
I need to go someplace
and sit myself down.

654
00:37:22,807 --> 00:37:24,434
Well, I think she should
stay here with me then.

655
00:37:24,475 --> 00:37:26,409
It's up to her, Ana.

656
00:37:36,887 --> 00:37:38,047
I can't believe you
doing this to me.

657
00:37:38,089 --> 00:37:40,284
I'm not doing
anything to you, Ana.

658
00:37:40,324 --> 00:37:42,019
Ma, you took her
from me 11 years ago.

659
00:37:42,059 --> 00:37:44,118
I kept your child
out of the system.

660
00:37:44,161 --> 00:37:46,425
I know, but I'm still her mother.

661
00:37:46,464 --> 00:37:49,194
I mean, how long are you gonna
keep punishing me for how I was?

662
00:37:49,233 --> 00:37:51,861
Did you hear anything
I just said? I'm tired.

663
00:37:51,902 --> 00:37:55,633
I'm gonna get myself a condo in Newport
News and I'm gonna relax for a minute.

664
00:37:55,673 --> 00:37:58,141
I've been taking care
of everybody else for 40 years

665
00:37:58,175 --> 00:38:00,735
and now I'm gonna do
something for myself for a change.

666
00:38:00,778 --> 00:38:03,872
You ain't never gonna let me
get out from underneath this, are you?

667
00:38:11,956 --> 00:38:15,016
You are a selfish woman, Ana.
You know that?

668
00:38:18,129 --> 00:38:21,929
Why don't you try thinking
about somebody else for a change?

669
00:38:27,972 --> 00:38:29,735
Kelly!

670
00:38:29,774 --> 00:38:31,765
What are you
doing here?

671
00:38:31,809 --> 00:38:34,243
I need to talk to you.

672
00:38:46,724 --> 00:38:48,954
I'm Mrs. Wallace.
I'm Kelly's mother.

673
00:38:48,993 --> 00:38:52,224
Oh, Mrs. Wallace, my name's Marcus.
It's a pleasure to meet you.

674
00:38:52,263 --> 00:38:53,855
Yeah, well, I'm gonna
be late for practice.

675
00:38:53,898 --> 00:38:55,365
This won't take long.

676
00:38:55,399 --> 00:38:58,095
- Hey, well, let me go then.
- Hold up. Before you go,

677
00:38:58,135 --> 00:39:00,569
- let me give you something.
- Ma, don't.

678
00:39:01,839 --> 00:39:04,239
Here, these should fit you.

679
00:39:06,644 --> 00:39:08,874
I want you to read all this
literature from cover to cover.

680
00:39:08,913 --> 00:39:10,710
Thanks, Mrs. Wallace.

681
00:39:10,748 --> 00:39:12,238
You can thank me
by being safe.

682
00:39:13,651 --> 00:39:16,711
I'Il... I'll call you later.

683
00:39:18,956 --> 00:39:20,583
Ma, you know you just
embarrassed me?

684
00:39:20,624 --> 00:39:22,489
What? I embarrass
you by doing my job?

685
00:39:22,526 --> 00:39:24,118
Why are you here?
Did you find Amare?

686
00:39:24,161 --> 00:39:26,652
Well, I got some leads.
Come on.

687
00:39:26,697 --> 00:39:29,188
Come over here with me.
I need to sit down while I tell you.

688
00:39:31,035 --> 00:39:32,969
So, you got a boyfriend?

689
00:39:33,003 --> 00:39:35,233
Ma, just tell me about Amare.

690
00:39:37,441 --> 00:39:39,875
All right, but first
let me show you these.

691
00:39:51,355 --> 00:39:54,586
- They nice, right?
- Yeah, they nice. What'd you hear?

692
00:39:56,460 --> 00:39:59,452
Your grandma told me she thinking
about moving back down to Virginia,

693
00:39:59,497 --> 00:40:03,456
and I was thinking it might be a good
time for you to move in with me and Kim.

694
00:40:03,501 --> 00:40:05,492
I really don't want to talk
about this right now.

695
00:40:05,536 --> 00:40:06,798
Well, what about Markus?

696
00:40:06,837 --> 00:40:08,668
What's gonna happen
to Markus if you go?

697
00:40:08,706 --> 00:40:11,300
Look, are you gonna tell me what
you found out about Amare or what?

698
00:40:11,342 --> 00:40:13,105
All right. Okay.

699
00:40:14,979 --> 00:40:16,879
I talked to his sister.

700
00:40:16,914 --> 00:40:19,314
She gave me the name of
this guy he hangs out with.

701
00:40:19,350 --> 00:40:21,113
I think I know where
I can find him.

702
00:40:23,554 --> 00:40:25,954
That's it?

703
00:40:25,990 --> 00:40:27,924
You came all the way
over here to tell me

704
00:40:27,958 --> 00:40:30,426
you might be able to find
some guy Amare knows?

705
00:40:30,461 --> 00:40:33,396
Look, I got a job
and your sister to raise.

706
00:40:33,431 --> 00:40:36,298
You asked me to help you,
Kelly, and that's what I'm trying to do.

707
00:40:36,333 --> 00:40:37,960
Well, I got to go.

708
00:40:38,002 --> 00:40:40,436
Call me if you find
out anything else.

709
00:40:40,471 --> 00:40:43,907
- Well, answer your cell phone.
- Yeah, I'll see you.

710
00:40:50,147 --> 00:40:51,273
Here you go, baby.

711
00:40:53,684 --> 00:40:55,345
Did you put the protein powder in it?

712
00:40:55,386 --> 00:40:57,411
- It's in there.
- Can I have some?

713
00:40:57,455 --> 00:40:59,218
- What do you say?
- Please.

714
00:40:59,256 --> 00:41:02,350
I need to look at
that homework, okay?

715
00:41:02,393 --> 00:41:04,224
Go get it and bring it in here.

716
00:41:13,103 --> 00:41:15,936
My mother not gonna do nothing
but talk against me on this.

717
00:41:15,973 --> 00:41:18,840
I mean she sees how
I am with Kim.

718
00:41:18,876 --> 00:41:21,811
She even pointed it out
the other day how involved I am

719
00:41:21,846 --> 00:41:24,872
with her school and everything.
But when it comes to Kelly,

720
00:41:24,915 --> 00:41:27,145
she acts like she's hers
or something now.

721
00:41:27,184 --> 00:41:29,618
I think you're looking
for someone to blame.

722
00:41:31,055 --> 00:41:32,283
Kelly's got a mind of her own.

723
00:41:32,323 --> 00:41:34,985
Yeah, a manipulative one.

724
00:41:35,025 --> 00:41:36,856
It's okay when she comes
to ask me for help,

725
00:41:36,894 --> 00:41:39,055
- but when I ask her to do something...
- Wanting to move her in here

726
00:41:39,096 --> 00:41:41,564
is a little more than
something, don't you think?

727
00:41:41,599 --> 00:41:44,090
Besides, where's she gonna sleep?
You gonna put her in there with Kim?

728
00:41:44,134 --> 00:41:46,762
She could sleep wherever
the hell she wants.

729
00:41:46,804 --> 00:41:48,897
If she decides to stay,
we're gonna figure it out.

730
00:41:48,939 --> 00:41:50,566
No, you're gonna figure it out.

731
00:41:50,608 --> 00:41:53,202
It doesn't seem like there's a
whole lot of "we" going on here.

732
00:41:53,244 --> 00:41:54,836
Well, no, you damn right it ain't.

733
00:41:54,879 --> 00:41:56,847
This is my problem.
Kelly is my family.

734
00:41:56,881 --> 00:41:58,439
Oh yeah, well, you wouldn't
know it by the way she acts.

735
00:41:58,482 --> 00:42:00,416
Aside from this Amare business,
when was the last time

736
00:42:00,451 --> 00:42:01,782
- she even came over here?
- Fuck you, Slick!

737
00:42:01,819 --> 00:42:03,252
Ma!

738
00:42:08,025 --> 00:42:10,152
She's sorry.

739
00:42:12,530 --> 00:42:14,498
Yes, I am.

740
00:42:14,532 --> 00:42:17,057
Sorry, baby.
I shouldn't have said that.

741
00:42:21,405 --> 00:42:22,895
Come on.
Come sit down.

742
00:42:22,940 --> 00:42:24,840
Come watch the game
with your mom.

743
00:42:27,811 --> 00:42:30,302
- Here you go.
- Thank you, Daddy.

744
00:42:31,916 --> 00:42:35,181
Come on, Slick. You love me
or you gonna stay mad at me?

745
00:42:35,219 --> 00:42:37,016
I'm gonna do both.

746
00:42:43,527 --> 00:42:45,722
Move over.

747
00:43:49,426 --> 00:43:52,224
Viv, I mean that was my girl,
you know what I'm saying?

748
00:43:52,262 --> 00:43:54,355
And we got pregnant
around the same time.

749
00:43:54,398 --> 00:43:57,265
I got pregnant with Kelly
and then Viv got pregnant with Amare.

750
00:43:57,301 --> 00:44:00,065
So, the kids grew up real tight.

751
00:44:00,104 --> 00:44:03,596
He just doing crack and the rest
of that stuff right now, right?

752
00:44:03,641 --> 00:44:06,303
- And he's positive.
- He has nobody to talk to.

753
00:44:06,343 --> 00:44:08,277
- His parents are gone.
- And my mother

754
00:44:08,312 --> 00:44:10,473
already threw him
out of her house

755
00:44:10,514 --> 00:44:12,482
for stealing or something...

756
00:44:12,516 --> 00:44:14,507
I don't know, some ignorance.

757
00:44:14,551 --> 00:44:16,212
But, you know he's too young

758
00:44:16,253 --> 00:44:18,881
to be out there, HIV positive,

759
00:44:18,922 --> 00:44:20,685
you know, with all this stuff going on

760
00:44:20,724 --> 00:44:23,488
and not have any family
other than my daughter.

761
00:44:37,708 --> 00:44:40,575
Welcome to the United
Community Church of God.

762
00:44:40,611 --> 00:44:44,377
My name is Sister Bernice.
It's so good to see you all here today.

763
00:44:44,415 --> 00:44:45,848
Who would like to share?

764
00:44:47,418 --> 00:44:50,876
Lunch will be served
promptly afterwards.

765
00:44:57,027 --> 00:44:59,291
Hey, what's up?
People call me Ness.

766
00:44:59,329 --> 00:45:01,320
I've been positive for two years.

767
00:45:01,365 --> 00:45:03,458
I got the bug shooting H.

768
00:45:03,500 --> 00:45:06,936
A few days ago, I go in the
drugstore to get my new meds.

769
00:45:06,970 --> 00:45:08,767
The guy behind
the counter's cool

770
00:45:08,806 --> 00:45:11,741
until he sees the prescription.
I know you know what I'm talking about.

771
00:45:11,775 --> 00:45:14,107
The guy got all nervous,
put the paper up on the counter

772
00:45:14,144 --> 00:45:16,271
like he was afraid
I was gonna touch him.

773
00:45:16,313 --> 00:45:18,281
But I stay upbeat about it, you know?
Maybe I got the same type

774
00:45:18,315 --> 00:45:19,509
of HIV Magic Johnson got.

775
00:45:19,550 --> 00:45:21,177
He got it, put on 50 Ibs.

776
00:45:21,218 --> 00:45:23,618
Got movie theaters
all across the country, you know,

777
00:45:23,654 --> 00:45:27,181
put frappuccinos in the 'hood.
Did a commercial for Lincoln Navigator.

778
00:45:27,224 --> 00:45:29,818
Maybe I got that same
entrepreneur strain of HIV

779
00:45:29,860 --> 00:45:31,555
like Magic got, you know?

780
00:45:31,595 --> 00:45:34,587
This HIV could be the kick in the ass I
need to get my life on the right track.

781
00:45:34,631 --> 00:45:37,225
Well, you'd think with all the money
Mr. Bush is giving these churches

782
00:45:37,267 --> 00:45:39,428
they'd at least be able to
afford some fresh vegetables.

783
00:45:39,470 --> 00:45:40,903
Ana, how you doing, girl?

784
00:45:40,938 --> 00:45:44,339
What's up, Ness?
I figured I'd find you here.

785
00:45:44,374 --> 00:45:46,035
I liked your share.

786
00:45:46,076 --> 00:45:48,840
Yeah, this nigger will
say anything for a hot meal.

787
00:45:48,879 --> 00:45:51,006
Yeah, I noticed.

788
00:45:51,048 --> 00:45:53,346
Hey, look, you know Amare, right?

789
00:45:53,383 --> 00:45:54,975
He owes you money too?

790
00:45:55,018 --> 00:45:57,418
No no no, it ain't
nothing like that.

791
00:45:57,454 --> 00:45:59,046
I ain't seen him
in a while.

792
00:45:59,089 --> 00:46:01,250
Heard he was doing some
street business, though.

793
00:46:01,291 --> 00:46:02,451
Hustling?

794
00:46:02,493 --> 00:46:04,825
Nah, that's not his game.
Not that I know of.

795
00:46:04,862 --> 00:46:07,330
Heard he was selling his
anti-wasting injections.

796
00:46:07,364 --> 00:46:09,992
You know the bodybuilders
love that steroid shit.

797
00:46:10,033 --> 00:46:12,900
Wait a minute. He left his pills
at my mother's house,

798
00:46:12,936 --> 00:46:14,836
he's selling his 'roids.

799
00:46:17,107 --> 00:46:19,507
Sounds like your boy's not planning
on sticking around much longer.

800
00:46:19,543 --> 00:46:21,875
Why is he wasting his time
selling steroids?

801
00:46:21,912 --> 00:46:23,903
Hey, if you're gonna die anyway,
you might as well do it

802
00:46:23,947 --> 00:46:25,847
with a little bit
of money in your pocket.

803
00:46:25,883 --> 00:46:27,851
That's a fucked-up thing to say.

804
00:46:29,419 --> 00:46:32,286
Hey, you might want to ask around
about Amare under the El on New Lots.

805
00:46:32,322 --> 00:46:35,553
Them boys is trade,
but they into selling meds too.

806
00:46:35,592 --> 00:46:37,082
All right, thanks.

807
00:46:37,127 --> 00:46:39,994
Yeah. Wait, Ana.
Hook me up.

808
00:46:40,030 --> 00:46:41,657
If I find out any more about
Amare, I'll get at you.

809
00:46:41,698 --> 00:46:43,188
All right, I'm gonna
hold you to that.

810
00:46:43,233 --> 00:46:44,530
Gotcha.

811
00:46:44,568 --> 00:46:47,537
Don't let Sister Bernice
catch you with those.

812
00:46:56,046 --> 00:46:59,607
Hey, how you doing?
My name is Ana Wallace.

813
00:46:59,650 --> 00:47:01,743
I'm from an outreach group
called Life Support.

814
00:47:01,785 --> 00:47:03,013
What's wrong with your feet?

815
00:47:03,053 --> 00:47:04,850
Must be walking on them
too much, you know?

816
00:47:04,888 --> 00:47:07,880
Anyway, I'm looking for this kid
right here. His name is Amare.

817
00:47:07,925 --> 00:47:09,290
I thought you might know him.

818
00:47:11,929 --> 00:47:13,590
- He's cute.
- Mm-hmm.

819
00:47:13,630 --> 00:47:15,359
- Sorry.
- No?

820
00:47:15,399 --> 00:47:16,764
I wish I did.

821
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:18,859
All right.
Well, thank you.

822
00:47:18,902 --> 00:47:20,631
You think you could
help me out?

823
00:47:22,306 --> 00:47:24,968
I need some money so me and my
boyfriend could get off these streets.

824
00:47:26,410 --> 00:47:28,901
Well, I don't have
no money for you,

825
00:47:28,946 --> 00:47:31,471
but I do work for
this HIV prevention

826
00:47:31,515 --> 00:47:33,278
and support program.

827
00:47:33,317 --> 00:47:36,775
Now, if you fit this profile,
we could definitely help you.

828
00:47:36,820 --> 00:47:39,755
We got free testing,
free counseling services,

829
00:47:39,790 --> 00:47:41,758
some condoms in the bottom
of that bag too.

830
00:47:41,792 --> 00:47:42,986
Okay.

831
00:47:43,026 --> 00:47:46,792
- What's your name?
- Andre.

832
00:47:46,830 --> 00:47:48,764
All right, I'm gonna
be looking for you.

833
00:47:48,799 --> 00:47:50,960
- Okay.
- Okay.

834
00:47:51,001 --> 00:47:52,298
Miss?

835
00:47:53,704 --> 00:47:55,672
You sure you can't
spare anything?

836
00:48:07,284 --> 00:48:09,684
Here. $5.
Now you got more than me.

837
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:11,620
Don't spend it on no drugs, either.

838
00:48:11,655 --> 00:48:13,282
I don't do drugs.

839
00:48:14,625 --> 00:48:17,116
Okay, well...

840
00:48:17,160 --> 00:48:19,128
call that number, all right?

841
00:48:24,935 --> 00:48:27,028
- Tender?
- Mm-hmm.

842
00:48:27,070 --> 00:48:29,504
Describe for me how the
sensations have changed.

843
00:48:30,707 --> 00:48:33,733
They tingle like I got
frostbite or something.

844
00:48:33,777 --> 00:48:36,712
- Has the Neurotin helped with the pain?
- I stopped taking it.

845
00:48:36,747 --> 00:48:39,238
- Ana.
- How am I supposed to make it to work

846
00:48:39,283 --> 00:48:41,717
and take Kim to school?
I can't even get past the bathroom.

847
00:48:42,920 --> 00:48:45,388
All right.

848
00:48:47,591 --> 00:48:50,355
I'm gonna replace it with Vicodin.

849
00:48:50,394 --> 00:48:51,691
Try it. Let me know
if it works better.

850
00:48:51,728 --> 00:48:53,252
Great. Another drug.

851
00:48:55,198 --> 00:48:56,927
Look, we got to wrap this up.

852
00:48:56,967 --> 00:48:59,162
I got to get to my daughter's
basketball game.

853
00:48:59,202 --> 00:49:00,635
If you don't slow down,

854
00:49:00,671 --> 00:49:04,232
you're gonna lose
the use of your feet,

855
00:49:04,274 --> 00:49:06,606
- period.
- Well, what you want me to do,

856
00:49:06,643 --> 00:49:09,339
lie in bed all day
thinking about dying?

857
00:49:09,379 --> 00:49:11,210
We've been through this, Ana.

858
00:49:11,248 --> 00:49:13,341
You got to take better
care of yourself.

859
00:49:13,383 --> 00:49:16,546
This virus will make you
a cripple if you let it.

860
00:49:21,224 --> 00:49:23,624
Thank you.

861
00:49:30,233 --> 00:49:31,860
Hey, Ma, you should've seen it.

862
00:49:31,902 --> 00:49:33,267
Kelly had 12 points
and a lot of assists.

863
00:49:33,303 --> 00:49:34,702
Yeah, you missed it.

864
00:49:34,738 --> 00:49:38,230
I got held up at the doctor.
I'm sorry, baby.

865
00:49:38,275 --> 00:49:40,971
You should've seen
her hustling all over that court.

866
00:49:41,011 --> 00:49:42,945
She made me so proud.
She's fierce.

867
00:49:42,980 --> 00:49:44,948
She's really
getting good at this.

868
00:49:46,650 --> 00:49:48,242
- Can I stay over with Kelly?
- Not tonight, Kim.

869
00:49:48,285 --> 00:49:50,845
You'll see her this weekend.

870
00:49:50,887 --> 00:49:53,515
- I need to talk to you about Amare.
- What about that boy?

871
00:49:53,557 --> 00:49:55,957
Nothing, Ma.
It's between me and Kelly.

872
00:49:57,928 --> 00:49:59,395
Fine. Don't tell me, then.

873
00:49:59,429 --> 00:50:01,363
He's just in a little trouble.

874
00:50:01,398 --> 00:50:03,366
I'm just trying to get him
into a shelter, that's all.

875
00:50:05,235 --> 00:50:08,204
I'll wait for you in the car.
Come on. Let's go.

876
00:50:13,043 --> 00:50:15,068
How could you throw
a sick boy out on the streets?

877
00:50:15,112 --> 00:50:17,307
- That's just plain cruel.
- Grandma didn't throw him

878
00:50:17,347 --> 00:50:19,611
- out on the street, Ma.
- She did, last summer.

879
00:50:19,649 --> 00:50:22,277
He stole her pearl earrings, Ma.
You forget about that?

880
00:50:22,319 --> 00:50:23,877
So, what?
You giving up on him now too?

881
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:25,547
- No.
- Am I out here wasting my time?

882
00:50:25,589 --> 00:50:27,989
'Cause my feet hurt.
I don't need to go through this.

883
00:50:33,196 --> 00:50:36,029
Look, that boy ain't thinking straight.

884
00:50:36,066 --> 00:50:39,058
He's not taking his pills.
He's selling his steroids.

885
00:50:39,102 --> 00:50:41,297
And being out there on the street,

886
00:50:41,338 --> 00:50:43,772
- I mean, that's like a death sentence.
- I know that, Ma.

887
00:50:43,807 --> 00:50:45,536
Did you know he was
selling his meds?

888
00:50:45,575 --> 00:50:48,510
Nah. I mean I knew he was in trouble.
That's why I came to you for help.

889
00:50:48,545 --> 00:50:51,275
All right.

890
00:50:51,314 --> 00:50:54,750
But what about this
boyfriend of his? Michael?

891
00:50:54,785 --> 00:50:56,616
I went by his studio,
remember?

892
00:50:56,653 --> 00:50:59,520
He acted like he
barely even knew Amare.

893
00:50:59,556 --> 00:51:01,922
Yo, Kelly!
Grandma's outside waiting for you!

894
00:51:05,462 --> 00:51:08,192
Kelly, I really am sorry
I missed your game, babe.

895
00:51:08,231 --> 00:51:09,960
Whatever, Ma.

896
00:52:02,152 --> 00:52:04,586
- Hey, come here.
- Stop it.

897
00:52:07,090 --> 00:52:09,354
Oh, someone told me the other day
I was supposed to use this.

898
00:52:09,392 --> 00:52:11,451
Put that away.

899
00:52:13,130 --> 00:52:15,121
- Speak of the devil.
- Ah.

900
00:52:16,666 --> 00:52:19,226
Yo, so how come your Mom
be passing out rubbers and shit?

901
00:52:19,269 --> 00:52:21,829
'Cause she works for
an AIDS outreach group.

902
00:52:21,872 --> 00:52:24,739
- For real?
- Yeah.

903
00:52:24,774 --> 00:52:27,868
Oh, that's some heavy
shit right there.

904
00:52:27,911 --> 00:52:31,074
I couldn't do it... you know,
being around them people all the time.

905
00:52:31,114 --> 00:52:33,412
- I'd be, like, paranoid.
- Yeah.

906
00:52:36,586 --> 00:52:38,577
Amare?

907
00:52:38,622 --> 00:52:40,055
Amare, hold up!

908
00:52:40,090 --> 00:52:41,648
Hey wait, Kelly!
What's going on?

909
00:52:41,691 --> 00:52:44,216
Who is that?

910
00:52:46,763 --> 00:52:48,560
You okay?

911
00:52:59,176 --> 00:53:01,007
What do you think
you're doing?

912
00:53:01,044 --> 00:53:04,241
Do you know the fright you gave me when
I looked in your room and you were gone?

913
00:53:04,281 --> 00:53:06,476
Where have you been?

914
00:53:06,516 --> 00:53:08,746
And don't even think
about lying to me.

915
00:53:11,188 --> 00:53:12,416
I was out with Markus.

916
00:53:12,455 --> 00:53:13,888
Till 1:00 in the morning?

917
00:53:13,924 --> 00:53:15,391
Have you lost your mind?

918
00:53:15,425 --> 00:53:17,916
- I'm sorry, Grandma, but...
- But nothing!

919
00:53:19,563 --> 00:53:22,054
I do not want you having
the same kind of life as your mother!

920
00:53:22,098 --> 00:53:24,396
I can't stand it!
I can't stand it!

921
00:53:25,869 --> 00:53:27,530
Now, you need
to be very careful

922
00:53:27,571 --> 00:53:29,471
about the people that
you pick for your friends

923
00:53:29,506 --> 00:53:31,667
and the influence that
they have on your life.

924
00:53:31,708 --> 00:53:34,939
You have to be very careful,
and I'm not putting up with it.

925
00:53:34,978 --> 00:53:37,811
And I don't want to see it again.

926
00:53:37,847 --> 00:53:39,474
I don't want you coming
in here this time of night.

927
00:53:39,516 --> 00:53:42,076
I want you coming in here
at a reasonable time.

928
00:53:42,118 --> 00:53:44,109
And if you can't come
in here at a reasonable time,

929
00:53:44,154 --> 00:53:46,122
then you don't need to go out.

930
00:53:46,156 --> 00:53:47,589
Or you need to go someplace else

931
00:53:47,624 --> 00:53:49,251
where they don't have
any rules and regulations.

932
00:53:51,194 --> 00:53:52,855
Grandma, it's not what you think.

933
00:53:52,896 --> 00:53:55,330
I saw Amare and he left before
I even had a chance to talk to him.

934
00:53:55,365 --> 00:53:58,129
That boy has brought
nothing but trouble

935
00:53:58,168 --> 00:53:59,328
into this house.

936
00:53:59,369 --> 00:54:01,564
Grandma, he's sick

937
00:54:01,605 --> 00:54:03,573
and he's gonna die
if somebody doesn't help him.

938
00:54:03,607 --> 00:54:05,131
You might not care
about that, but I do!

939
00:54:05,175 --> 00:54:07,166
Don't talk to me about
I don't care. Nuh-uh.

940
00:54:08,912 --> 00:54:10,846
Amare's welcome in this house

941
00:54:10,880 --> 00:54:12,347
as long he's willing to abide

942
00:54:12,382 --> 00:54:14,316
by the rules and regulations.

943
00:54:14,351 --> 00:54:16,819
And last summer, when
he started all of that,

944
00:54:16,853 --> 00:54:19,686
"Oh, the house got robbed" stuff,

945
00:54:19,723 --> 00:54:22,453
I'm sorry, baby, but
that was unacceptable to me.

946
00:54:22,492 --> 00:54:25,222
I'm willing to help Amare

947
00:54:25,262 --> 00:54:27,492
when he's ready.

948
00:54:33,136 --> 00:54:35,001
Well, Grandma,
it's kind of crazy

949
00:54:35,038 --> 00:54:37,199
'cause I feel like half the time
he doesn't even want my help.

950
00:54:37,240 --> 00:54:39,071
He be lying and playing me,

951
00:54:39,109 --> 00:54:41,077
and I don't understand why
he would do something like that.

952
00:54:41,111 --> 00:54:43,841
Well, that's just like your mother.
She tried every trick in the book.

953
00:54:43,880 --> 00:54:46,849
But Ma is not like Amare.

954
00:54:52,522 --> 00:54:55,252
Ana hurt me.

955
00:54:58,762 --> 00:55:01,697
It's taken me a long
time to forgive her.

956
00:55:01,731 --> 00:55:04,029
And sometimes I still can't.

957
00:55:06,369 --> 00:55:09,463
I try my best to remember
everything she's done with herself

958
00:55:09,506 --> 00:55:11,838
ever since she stopped
messing with those drugs...

959
00:55:14,678 --> 00:55:16,145
because she does try.

960
00:55:23,987 --> 00:55:25,784
Hey, Sandra.

961
00:55:25,822 --> 00:55:27,687
- Hey.
- How's it going?

962
00:55:28,692 --> 00:55:30,557
Bad day, Ana.

963
00:55:40,003 --> 00:55:43,234
She was just in here last week.
She was healthy as could be.

964
00:55:43,273 --> 00:55:45,434
It wasn't the virus that killed her.

965
00:55:47,477 --> 00:55:49,707
Her husband shot her.

966
00:55:54,050 --> 00:55:56,143
Did you do a
domestic-violence screening?

967
00:55:56,186 --> 00:55:57,881
I asked her.

968
00:56:03,927 --> 00:56:05,292
Hey.

969
00:56:05,328 --> 00:56:07,922
There wasn't anything
else you could have done.

970
00:56:07,964 --> 00:56:09,955
I'm sorry, girl.

971
00:56:18,575 --> 00:56:20,338
Damn, Deyah.

972
00:56:21,878 --> 00:56:24,176
Why didn't you say something?

973
00:57:05,054 --> 00:57:06,351
Already?

974
00:57:06,389 --> 00:57:09,085
Mm-hmm.
Some college girl took it.

975
00:57:09,125 --> 00:57:11,753
The realtor said her
father's putting up cash.

976
00:57:12,829 --> 00:57:14,956
I know. Surprised me too.

977
00:57:18,935 --> 00:57:20,300
Did Kelly say what
she wanted to do yet?

978
00:57:20,336 --> 00:57:22,702
Ask her. Kelly!

979
00:57:22,739 --> 00:57:24,434
Ma, don't put me in that position.

980
00:57:29,379 --> 00:57:30,812
Ana wants to ask you a question.

981
00:57:40,089 --> 00:57:42,922
So, you watch that
Chris Tucker movie I got you?

982
00:57:42,959 --> 00:57:45,325
Yeah, he crazy.

983
00:57:45,361 --> 00:57:47,852
I thought you would like it.

984
00:57:52,635 --> 00:57:54,603
Why don't you come live with me

985
00:57:54,637 --> 00:57:57,504
when your grandma moves?

986
00:57:57,540 --> 00:57:58,837
But, Ma...

987
00:57:58,875 --> 00:58:00,900
you know I always wanted
to leave New York.

988
00:58:00,944 --> 00:58:04,277
And I'm going to college
down south anyway.

989
00:58:04,314 --> 00:58:06,009
It'll be a good transition.

990
00:58:09,853 --> 00:58:11,844
So, that's it. You decided?

991
00:58:11,888 --> 00:58:13,981
Mm-hmm.

992
00:58:16,493 --> 00:58:18,393
Look, Ma, don't take it personally.

993
00:58:18,428 --> 00:58:20,020
I just think it would be a good idea.

994
00:58:20,063 --> 00:58:22,725
It's not me I'm worried about.
It's... it's Kim.

995
00:58:25,101 --> 00:58:27,399
Maybe we should cut back
on the sleepovers,

996
00:58:27,437 --> 00:58:29,769
'cause she really
looks up to you

997
00:58:29,806 --> 00:58:33,640
and we got to make it so she don't feel
so much when y'all leave her.

998
00:58:35,044 --> 00:58:38,207
Or maybe Kim could just
move down south with us.

999
00:58:40,149 --> 00:58:43,550
She could have a backyard,
ride a bike in the streets.

1000
00:58:43,586 --> 00:58:45,747
It would be a real childhood.

1001
00:58:45,788 --> 00:58:48,052
What the hell are
you talking about?

1002
00:58:48,091 --> 00:58:50,685
- It was just an idea.
- You ain't taking my child nowhere,

1003
00:58:50,727 --> 00:58:52,627
- you stuck-up little bitch!
- Excuse me?

1004
00:58:52,662 --> 00:58:54,755
You heard me!
I'm tired of trying with you!

1005
00:58:54,797 --> 00:58:56,890
- Good, stop then!
- Live with your grandmother!

1006
00:58:56,933 --> 00:58:59,094
Maybe next time you see me
I'll be dead in my grave!

1007
00:58:59,135 --> 00:59:00,329
That's some straight bullshit!

1008
00:59:00,370 --> 00:59:02,736
I ain't the one that
gave you the virus, ma!

1009
00:59:02,772 --> 00:59:04,330
Go get with Slick on that!

1010
00:59:04,374 --> 00:59:06,433
- You leave Slick out of this!
- You ain't gonna make me

1011
00:59:06,476 --> 00:59:09,411
feel guilty because you're sick,

1012
00:59:09,445 --> 00:59:11,845
because you was a fucking fiend.

1013
00:59:21,357 --> 00:59:23,382
It's too hot for you
to be working out here.

1014
00:59:24,427 --> 00:59:26,827
I'm just doing
what I got to do.

1015
00:59:26,863 --> 00:59:29,093
Dropped Kim off at my mom's.

1016
00:59:29,132 --> 00:59:30,622
And?

1017
00:59:31,801 --> 00:59:34,201
She sold the house.

1018
00:59:34,237 --> 00:59:36,034
She's taking Kelly
to Virginia with her.

1019
00:59:36,072 --> 00:59:37,596
Oh yeah?

1020
00:59:37,640 --> 00:59:38,971
That's all you got to say?

1021
00:59:39,008 --> 00:59:40,168
Moving down south.

1022
00:59:40,209 --> 00:59:42,370
Shit, that's the Black American dream.
Let 'em live it.

1023
00:59:42,412 --> 00:59:44,607
They want Kim to go, too.

1024
00:59:44,647 --> 00:59:47,616
Oh, hell no.
She ain't going down there.

1025
00:59:47,650 --> 00:59:50,118
Yeah, exactly. Now you know
how I feel about Kelly.

1026
00:59:50,153 --> 00:59:51,552
You gotta want what's best for Kelly,
not what's best for you.

1027
00:59:51,588 --> 00:59:53,021
I'm telling her she can't go.

1028
00:59:53,056 --> 00:59:54,819
Oh, that might work.

1029
00:59:54,857 --> 00:59:57,485
Shut up, Slick. You know,
I could use a little support right now.

1030
00:59:57,527 --> 00:59:59,358
Ana, I'm about tired
of this shit.

1031
00:59:59,395 --> 01:00:01,158
You ain't the only
one that's sick.

1032
01:00:01,197 --> 01:00:02,892
You ain't the only
one hurtin'.

1033
01:00:02,932 --> 01:00:06,333
Yeah, well, this ain't about you
and how you feel. It's about Kelly.

1034
01:00:06,369 --> 01:00:08,633
You tripping, Ana.
You acting like a fiend.

1035
01:00:08,671 --> 01:00:11,469
And I feel for Kelly.
Got you clocking her every move.

1036
01:00:11,507 --> 01:00:13,202
Lucille ain't taking
her away from me again.

1037
01:00:13,242 --> 01:00:15,574
Well, we're gonna talk
about Kelly when I get home.

1038
01:00:15,612 --> 01:00:17,375
You know, you never did
care about her anyway.

1039
01:00:17,413 --> 01:00:19,711
Even when she was a little girl
you refused to be her daddy.

1040
01:00:19,749 --> 01:00:22,274
Oh, hold on now.

1041
01:00:22,318 --> 01:00:24,013
Hold on now, that's not true.

1042
01:00:24,053 --> 01:00:26,886
Because we both know
she never liked me.

1043
01:00:26,923 --> 01:00:29,858
First, I'm the guy that
her mama met running in the street,

1044
01:00:29,892 --> 01:00:32,053
and then I'm the guy
gave her mama HIV.

1045
01:00:32,095 --> 01:00:33,255
And you never did
a damn thing to change that.

1046
01:00:33,296 --> 01:00:34,695
She wasn't wrong.

1047
01:00:34,731 --> 01:00:36,426
You know, you can be
a straight up bitch, Ana.

1048
01:00:36,466 --> 01:00:38,991
I was careful. You was the one
that got buck-ass wild,

1049
01:00:39,035 --> 01:00:41,230
shooting up with strangers
on the fucking corner and shit!

1050
01:00:41,270 --> 01:00:43,704
Are you ever gonna let that go?
Because we both know the game, baby.

1051
01:00:43,740 --> 01:00:45,799
It could've just as easily been
you that gave it to me.

1052
01:00:45,842 --> 01:00:47,275
Yeah, but I didn't, Slick.

1053
01:00:47,310 --> 01:00:50,837
Because I handled my business!
You the one that let it slip,

1054
01:00:50,880 --> 01:00:52,609
and you brought me down
right with your ass!

1055
01:00:52,649 --> 01:00:57,279
- Fuck you, Ana!
- Slick...

1056
01:00:57,320 --> 01:00:58,947
You just better
get the fuck out of my face.

1057
01:01:22,979 --> 01:01:26,471
I lost custody of
my daughter when I was 25...

1058
01:01:28,951 --> 01:01:31,181
'cause of the drugs.

1059
01:01:31,220 --> 01:01:33,916
I signed her over to my mother.

1060
01:01:35,992 --> 01:01:39,120
And now my mother's about
to move back to Virginia...

1061
01:01:40,663 --> 01:01:43,188
and she's probably gonna take
my daughter with her.

1062
01:01:49,439 --> 01:01:52,340
And I just...
I miss her, you know?

1063
01:01:53,776 --> 01:01:56,643
I just miss her.
I just miss her all the time.

1064
01:01:59,015 --> 01:02:02,007
I miss what I missed of her...

1065
01:02:02,051 --> 01:02:03,746
growing up, you know?

1066
01:02:05,621 --> 01:02:08,590
And I got a younger
daughter and we so tight,

1067
01:02:08,624 --> 01:02:10,819
and now I'm clean, I'm sober.

1068
01:02:10,860 --> 01:02:13,260
I'm like, I try my best
to be a great mother...

1069
01:02:14,931 --> 01:02:16,831
but every day I spend
with my younger daughter

1070
01:02:16,866 --> 01:02:20,029
just makes me really realize

1071
01:02:20,069 --> 01:02:21,696
how much I missed
with my older daughter.

1072
01:02:21,738 --> 01:02:25,265
And she could be so fucking
sarcastic sometimes,

1073
01:02:25,308 --> 01:02:27,276
and angry with me,

1074
01:02:27,310 --> 01:02:29,301
and my mother
is the same way.

1075
01:02:29,345 --> 01:02:32,007
Sometimes when my daughter talks,
I hear my mother's voice coming out

1076
01:02:32,048 --> 01:02:35,506
of her mouth and I know that's
because she been with her that long,

1077
01:02:35,551 --> 01:02:38,884
it's not my own. My own is
not there like it should be,

1078
01:02:38,921 --> 01:02:41,822
and I want my own voice
to come out sometimes a little more.

1079
01:02:41,858 --> 01:02:44,053
Now that may be
completely selfish.

1080
01:02:44,093 --> 01:02:47,585
You know, you may say, "Ana, what
the fuck? You the one was getting high,

1081
01:02:47,630 --> 01:02:50,292
and you the one that caught this,"
you know, all this kind of shit.

1082
01:02:50,333 --> 01:02:52,801
But you know what?
I'm just like, you know,

1083
01:02:52,835 --> 01:02:56,464
I'm trying to be a different
person. And you know,

1084
01:02:56,506 --> 01:02:59,407
I mean, how's she just
gonna up and move?

1085
01:02:59,442 --> 01:03:02,002
Like... my daughter's
almost grown.

1086
01:03:02,044 --> 01:03:04,239
Like, it's gone.
It's gone.

1087
01:03:08,885 --> 01:03:10,716
I just feel like
I'm running out of time.

1088
01:03:10,753 --> 01:03:13,153
I feel like she's about
to leave me, you know.

1089
01:03:13,189 --> 01:03:16,681
And I'm here now, you know,
and I wanna be there.

1090
01:03:19,495 --> 01:03:22,487
Like I said, this is just one
of them days, you know?

1091
01:03:36,746 --> 01:03:38,270
Okay, so this
promoter named MJ-2

1092
01:03:38,314 --> 01:03:40,214
runs these parties
over at The Pit.

1093
01:03:40,249 --> 01:03:41,739
He's all up in that
homo-thug world.

1094
01:03:41,784 --> 01:03:44,548
Got guys hustling
for him, the whole shit.

1095
01:03:44,587 --> 01:03:46,748
If anybody could find
Amare, it's him.

1096
01:03:46,789 --> 01:03:48,916
- He gay?
- How the hell do I know?

1097
01:03:48,958 --> 01:03:50,755
What, I got gaydar
or some shit?

1098
01:03:50,793 --> 01:03:52,761
I don't know, you just seem to know
a lot of different kinds of people,

1099
01:03:52,795 --> 01:03:54,592
- that's all.
- Just 'cause he's running the parties,

1100
01:03:54,630 --> 01:03:57,360
don't mean he can't be straight. He got
a family living out in Staten Island...

1101
01:03:57,400 --> 01:03:59,129
white picket fence,
the whole shit.

1102
01:03:59,168 --> 01:04:02,228
Yeah, family.
Definitely can't be gay.

1103
01:04:02,271 --> 01:04:04,034
So, what's up?
You gonna introduce me or what?

1104
01:04:04,073 --> 01:04:05,472
You gonna hook me up?

1105
01:04:10,613 --> 01:04:12,171
I can't believe you get
this much ass.

1106
01:04:14,483 --> 01:04:16,474
He got a party happening tonight.

1107
01:04:17,753 --> 01:04:19,084
What'd you say
his name was again?

1108
01:04:19,121 --> 01:04:21,715
MJ-2. You heard of him?

1109
01:04:23,125 --> 01:04:25,992
Owns a recording studio
called Hatlantic.

1110
01:04:26,028 --> 01:04:27,325
Thinks he's a producer,

1111
01:04:27,363 --> 01:04:29,854
but his joints are corny.

1112
01:04:33,836 --> 01:04:36,270
- You ready?
- Can I finish my fried rice, please?

1113
01:04:36,305 --> 01:04:37,363
Well, hurry up then.

1114
01:04:56,759 --> 01:04:58,624
You looking for MJ-2, right?

1115
01:04:58,661 --> 01:05:00,128
That's him deejaying.

1116
01:05:00,162 --> 01:05:01,424
Thanks for dinner.

1117
01:05:01,464 --> 01:05:03,295
I'm out.

1118
01:05:33,729 --> 01:05:35,560
Yeah, I know Amare.

1119
01:05:35,598 --> 01:05:37,463
He gives out flyers
for me sometimes.

1120
01:05:37,500 --> 01:05:40,128
Not a lot of jobs out there for
young brothers, so I try to do my part.

1121
01:05:40,169 --> 01:05:42,535
Well, he works for you,
so I thought, you know,

1122
01:05:42,571 --> 01:05:44,801
you might know some way
to find him that I don't.

1123
01:05:44,840 --> 01:05:48,207
Damn, that boy's popular. Got all
kind of women looking out for him.

1124
01:05:48,244 --> 01:05:49,734
Excuse me,

1125
01:05:49,779 --> 01:05:52,475
this is not a funny
situation to me.

1126
01:05:52,515 --> 01:05:55,245
And turn that fucking thing off
so you could talk to me for a minute.

1127
01:05:55,284 --> 01:05:58,276
I'm gonna tell you what I told shorty
that came looking for him last week.

1128
01:05:58,321 --> 01:06:00,414
I haven't seen him in a while.

1129
01:06:00,456 --> 01:06:03,323
Shorty... that wouldn't have happened
to be at Hatlantic, would it?

1130
01:06:05,027 --> 01:06:06,756
This is starting
to get tiring, okay?

1131
01:06:06,796 --> 01:06:09,026
I provide a service here,
a place where these boys

1132
01:06:09,065 --> 01:06:11,056
could be themselves.

1133
01:06:11,100 --> 01:06:14,536
Other than that, I try not to get up
in anybody's business.

1134
01:06:14,570 --> 01:06:16,663
Maybe you should think
about doing the same.

1135
01:06:16,706 --> 01:06:18,264
Well, ain't you a saint?

1136
01:06:18,307 --> 01:06:21,037
Let me tell you something,
MJ-2... or is it Michael?

1137
01:06:21,077 --> 01:06:22,567
I wonder what would happen

1138
01:06:22,611 --> 01:06:24,545
if I go to Staten Island
and ask your wife

1139
01:06:24,580 --> 01:06:26,013
what she think about your
little two-timing ways.

1140
01:06:26,048 --> 01:06:28,539
Bitch, don't you ever try
to threaten me or my family.

1141
01:06:28,584 --> 01:06:30,279
I will have your ass killed.

1142
01:06:30,319 --> 01:06:32,787
Go ahead! Please!

1143
01:06:32,822 --> 01:06:34,722
I got the virus.

1144
01:06:34,757 --> 01:06:37,851
I'm already dead,
motherfucker! What?

1145
01:06:37,893 --> 01:06:40,020
And let me tell you something:
I don't give a fuck

1146
01:06:40,062 --> 01:06:42,860
about you or your little
lying booty-bandit ass,

1147
01:06:42,898 --> 01:06:44,832
but you gonna help me
find that boy

1148
01:06:44,867 --> 01:06:47,097
before he dies on
these fucking streets.

1149
01:06:47,136 --> 01:06:48,728
Do you hear me?

1150
01:06:51,474 --> 01:06:53,601
Yeah, okay. Okay.

1151
01:06:55,077 --> 01:06:56,442
Put your number in my phone.

1152
01:07:01,650 --> 01:07:04,050
You just gotta make
a nigger go there. Here. Store it.

1153
01:07:30,146 --> 01:07:32,273
I was scared
you weren't coming home.

1154
01:07:32,314 --> 01:07:33,906
I thought about it.

1155
01:07:34,917 --> 01:07:36,407
I even went past the old spot.

1156
01:07:38,788 --> 01:07:40,813
Saw a lot of folks out there.

1157
01:07:40,856 --> 01:07:42,551
Getting high?

1158
01:07:58,874 --> 01:08:02,173
Ana, you keep pushing
and pushing

1159
01:08:02,211 --> 01:08:03,769
and I don't know why.

1160
01:08:03,813 --> 01:08:06,145
I know our life
ain't perfect, okay?

1161
01:08:06,182 --> 01:08:07,843
But it's good...

1162
01:08:09,452 --> 01:08:11,249
a lot of the time.

1163
01:08:14,123 --> 01:08:16,614
Better than it was before,
when we were using.

1164
01:08:20,763 --> 01:08:22,731
But you saying I could be
a bitch sometimes?

1165
01:08:22,765 --> 01:08:24,164
Yeah.

1166
01:08:25,301 --> 01:08:26,962
Well, damn, you could've
hesitated or something.

1167
01:08:27,002 --> 01:08:30,301
I guess I could have,
but what's true is true.

1168
01:08:31,407 --> 01:08:32,874
You being honest
or you being funny?

1169
01:08:32,908 --> 01:08:35,342
Both.

1170
01:08:50,526 --> 01:08:52,687
I love you,
but sometimes...

1171
01:08:52,728 --> 01:08:54,320
you play all of us...

1172
01:08:54,363 --> 01:08:56,763
me and Kelly,
and your moms.

1173
01:08:56,799 --> 01:09:00,257
You do what you want
no matter how it affects us.

1174
01:09:00,302 --> 01:09:01,360
That is not true.

1175
01:09:01,403 --> 01:09:03,200
See? There you go right there.

1176
01:09:03,239 --> 01:09:06,675
You gonna ask the question
but you don't wanna hear the answer.

1177
01:09:06,709 --> 01:09:09,269
You're stubborn,
and you don't listen.

1178
01:09:09,311 --> 01:09:11,279
Okay, Slick.

1179
01:09:11,313 --> 01:09:13,213
I'm sorry.

1180
01:09:18,320 --> 01:09:20,481
I'm gonna work on it.

1181
01:09:29,632 --> 01:09:31,259
So what, you been sitting
here all night?

1182
01:09:32,835 --> 01:09:34,860
Hardly.

1183
01:09:34,904 --> 01:09:36,633
I've been all over.

1184
01:09:39,508 --> 01:09:41,703
I said some wild shit
tonight about dying.

1185
01:09:41,744 --> 01:09:43,609
- Like what?
- Don't even matter.

1186
01:09:43,646 --> 01:09:44,874
I didn't mean it.

1187
01:09:44,914 --> 01:09:46,211
The bottom line is

1188
01:09:46,248 --> 01:09:48,580
I want to be around
for a long time.

1189
01:09:48,617 --> 01:09:50,608
Me and you,

1190
01:09:52,188 --> 01:09:54,679
that's how it needs to be.
You and me, not just you.

1191
01:09:59,428 --> 01:10:00,895
And you need
to chill out some.

1192
01:10:04,166 --> 01:10:06,066
And, you know, maybe

1193
01:10:06,101 --> 01:10:09,537
you can give me a
foot rub sometime. Huh?

1194
01:10:13,042 --> 01:10:15,909
Aw, yeah.

1195
01:10:15,945 --> 01:10:18,277
Now you go in there
and make me a sandwich too.

1196
01:10:18,314 --> 01:10:20,646
- At the same time?
- Uh-huh, rub my feet

1197
01:10:20,683 --> 01:10:23,379
- and make the sandwich.
- Okay, baby.

1198
01:10:34,330 --> 01:10:36,855
Hello? Where?

1199
01:10:38,634 --> 01:10:40,363
Right now?

1200
01:10:40,402 --> 01:10:42,302
Okay. Okay.

1201
01:10:42,338 --> 01:10:44,238
Who's that?

1202
01:10:44,273 --> 01:10:46,503
That was the guy
from the club.

1203
01:10:46,542 --> 01:10:47,975
He said he knows
where to find Amare.

1204
01:10:48,010 --> 01:10:49,671
I'm gonna see if I can
bring him home.

1205
01:10:49,712 --> 01:10:51,907
Okay. Let's roll.

1206
01:11:01,824 --> 01:11:03,951
Oh, he don't look right, baby.

1207
01:11:06,595 --> 01:11:08,563
Listen, you go.

1208
01:11:08,597 --> 01:11:10,895
I'm gonna be right here.

1209
01:11:10,933 --> 01:11:12,730
Okay. Okay, baby.

1210
01:11:18,774 --> 01:11:20,969
Amare?

1211
01:11:21,010 --> 01:11:23,444
Hey, how you doing?

1212
01:11:23,479 --> 01:11:25,538
Miss Wallace?

1213
01:11:27,683 --> 01:11:30,277
Is Kelly with you?
What are you doing here?

1214
01:11:30,319 --> 01:11:32,082
I've been looking
for you all over Brooklyn.

1215
01:11:32,121 --> 01:11:34,419
Let's go inside the building
and talk for a minute, okay?

1216
01:11:38,360 --> 01:11:40,089
I wanna stay here,
Miss Wallace.

1217
01:11:40,129 --> 01:11:42,893
It's kinda
hot out here.

1218
01:11:42,931 --> 01:11:44,796
I'm fine.

1219
01:11:56,211 --> 01:11:58,338
Remember when...

1220
01:11:59,682 --> 01:12:02,014
it would get too hot
in the apartment,

1221
01:12:04,153 --> 01:12:06,053
my parents would come
down here with us?

1222
01:12:07,623 --> 01:12:09,113
Mm-hmm.

1223
01:12:09,158 --> 01:12:11,023
Remember when y'all
was having that barbecue,

1224
01:12:11,060 --> 01:12:12,789
right over there?

1225
01:12:14,396 --> 01:12:15,954
We knew y'all was
just getting high.

1226
01:12:19,935 --> 01:12:22,460
There was
a big-ass rottweiler.

1227
01:12:22,504 --> 01:12:24,233
He was coming at us

1228
01:12:24,273 --> 01:12:27,071
and we was yelling for y'all.
Y'all were right over there,

1229
01:12:27,109 --> 01:12:29,634
but nobody came.

1230
01:12:32,114 --> 01:12:35,515
So Kelly grabbed a rib off
her plate and she threw it at him.

1231
01:12:37,319 --> 01:12:39,150
He was our best friend
after that, you know?

1232
01:12:49,965 --> 01:12:51,933
You know how I was
always happy for Kelly

1233
01:12:51,967 --> 01:12:53,832
that she got to be
with Lucille.

1234
01:12:53,869 --> 01:12:56,838
I mean...

1235
01:12:56,872 --> 01:12:58,499
I think she could be
a bitch sometimes...

1236
01:13:00,342 --> 01:13:02,310
but she kept her straight.

1237
01:13:02,344 --> 01:13:03,834
You know what I'm saying?

1238
01:13:07,316 --> 01:13:08,783
Yeah.

1239
01:13:10,686 --> 01:13:13,484
Yeah, I know. I really do.

1240
01:13:15,124 --> 01:13:17,592
Listen, Amare, I want you
to come home with me, okay?

1241
01:13:17,626 --> 01:13:19,924
Come on.
Let's get out of here.

1242
01:13:19,962 --> 01:13:22,021
I got a room set up
for you and everything.

1243
01:13:22,064 --> 01:13:25,727
I appreciate the thought,
but I'm cool here.

1244
01:13:28,003 --> 01:13:30,471
It ain't cool.
You can't stay out here, baby.

1245
01:13:30,506 --> 01:13:33,373
You know your sister's the one

1246
01:13:33,409 --> 01:13:34,637
who told me you was
out here, right?

1247
01:13:34,676 --> 01:13:36,871
She wants you to come
home with me too.

1248
01:13:38,280 --> 01:13:40,009
That's a lie.

1249
01:13:40,048 --> 01:13:42,380
If she cared about me,

1250
01:13:42,418 --> 01:13:44,716
she'd come down
here herself.

1251
01:13:49,224 --> 01:13:52,250
I'll be right back, okay?

1252
01:13:52,294 --> 01:13:54,762
Just stay right here.
I'm coming right back.

1253
01:13:57,099 --> 01:13:58,498
Watch him.

1254
01:14:01,937 --> 01:14:05,100
Damn elevator.

1255
01:14:17,419 --> 01:14:20,013
Tanya! Tanya, open up the door!

1256
01:14:21,824 --> 01:14:24,691
Open the door!
Your brother's outside dying!

1257
01:14:24,726 --> 01:14:27,559
Tanya, open up this door,
I know you hear me!

1258
01:14:27,596 --> 01:14:30,224
I know you fucking hear me!

1259
01:14:30,265 --> 01:14:32,392
Open up this fucking door!

1260
01:14:32,434 --> 01:14:34,265
Fuck this bullshit.

1261
01:14:38,140 --> 01:14:39,903
Hello? Yes.

1262
01:14:39,942 --> 01:14:43,070
I want to report attempted suicide
at the Tilden Projects.

1263
01:14:43,111 --> 01:14:45,841
He's sitting on a bench
in front of number 315.

1264
01:14:45,881 --> 01:14:48,941
Please send somebody quick.

1265
01:14:48,984 --> 01:14:50,781
Fuck. Some fucking choice!

1266
01:15:30,259 --> 01:15:33,717
Amare?

1267
01:16:14,503 --> 01:16:16,471
He looks bad, Ma.

1268
01:16:18,440 --> 01:16:20,408
They said
he has pneumonia.

1269
01:16:24,313 --> 01:16:27,339
He might not make it, Kelly.

1270
01:16:32,854 --> 01:16:34,617
Ma?

1271
01:16:36,091 --> 01:16:39,185
Ma, I'm sorry about
everything I said.

1272
01:16:39,227 --> 01:16:41,092
It's all right.
Come here.

1273
01:16:41,129 --> 01:16:43,791
Let me talk to you. I need
to talk to you about something.

1274
01:16:55,611 --> 01:16:58,671
Tonight,
when I found Amare,

1275
01:16:58,714 --> 01:17:01,945
he reminded me
of a couple of things.

1276
01:17:04,920 --> 01:17:06,888
I know you been trying
to do the same thing,

1277
01:17:06,922 --> 01:17:09,186
but I just wasn't
really trying to hear it.

1278
01:17:12,094 --> 01:17:15,154
I know I walk around here
thinking I'm different.

1279
01:17:16,431 --> 01:17:18,058
You know, I'm better now.

1280
01:17:21,770 --> 01:17:23,829
But deep down inside

1281
01:17:23,872 --> 01:17:25,931
I'm still that same old drug fiend.

1282
01:17:28,276 --> 01:17:30,836
I'm still scheming.

1283
01:17:34,883 --> 01:17:37,181
But only this time

1284
01:17:37,219 --> 01:17:39,210
it ain't for drugs. It's for you.

1285
01:17:52,267 --> 01:17:54,098
What I'm trying to say is...

1286
01:17:56,238 --> 01:17:58,729
I've been putting myself first,

1287
01:17:58,774 --> 01:18:01,937
trying so hard
to make you love me.

1288
01:18:05,047 --> 01:18:07,914
I ain't even really heard what you
been trying to say to me, you know?

1289
01:18:13,155 --> 01:18:16,488
Baby, just please
be patient with me,

1290
01:18:18,160 --> 01:18:20,025
'cause I'm really trying.

1291
01:18:27,536 --> 01:18:30,562
And you've grown.

1292
01:18:30,605 --> 01:18:33,802
You've grown up to be
quite a strong young woman...

1293
01:18:35,210 --> 01:18:38,008
you know?
I'm really proud of you

1294
01:18:38,046 --> 01:18:40,241
and I want to respect
what you need.

1295
01:18:41,416 --> 01:18:43,281
So, even if that means

1296
01:18:43,318 --> 01:18:45,047
that you need to move down
with your grandmother...

1297
01:18:45,087 --> 01:18:48,352
- I'm sorry.
...then that's what it's got to be.

1298
01:18:48,390 --> 01:18:50,881
Okay?

1299
01:18:50,926 --> 01:18:54,157
And don't be sorry.
Just be yourself.

1300
01:18:55,330 --> 01:18:57,423
You're beautiful.

1301
01:19:04,072 --> 01:19:07,269
- It's gonna be all right.
- Okay.

1302
01:19:57,526 --> 01:19:59,790
Each month we come up here
and we celebrate people

1303
01:19:59,828 --> 01:20:01,853
that have passed.

1304
01:20:01,897 --> 01:20:03,387
But today, I just
wanted to talk

1305
01:20:03,431 --> 01:20:06,025
a little bit about those
who are still with us.

1306
01:20:06,067 --> 01:20:09,127
You know, day by day we struggle,

1307
01:20:09,171 --> 01:20:11,036
and not only with the virus.

1308
01:20:11,072 --> 01:20:12,972
We struggle
with the government,

1309
01:20:13,008 --> 01:20:15,568
we struggle with
those who judge us,

1310
01:20:15,610 --> 01:20:19,068
we struggle with those
who ignore us, who fear us.

1311
01:20:19,114 --> 01:20:22,208
We even struggle with
those we love...

1312
01:20:24,619 --> 01:20:26,450
and those who love us.

1313
01:20:27,956 --> 01:20:29,355
So, today we give thanks

1314
01:20:29,391 --> 01:20:31,552
for all those who
stand alongside us...

1315
01:20:38,200 --> 01:20:39,827
our families
and friends...

1316
01:20:41,636 --> 01:20:43,570
doctors, nurses,

1317
01:20:43,605 --> 01:20:47,063
just everyone that...

1318
01:20:47,108 --> 01:20:49,542
helps give us the strength
and courage to carry on.

1319
01:20:54,149 --> 01:20:56,549
Each month we come up here
and we release these balloons

1320
01:20:56,585 --> 01:20:59,952
in honor of those we lost.
And we do it with love,

1321
01:20:59,988 --> 01:21:02,149
with sorrow,

1322
01:21:02,190 --> 01:21:04,158
and with the hope

1323
01:21:04,192 --> 01:21:06,183
that one day they'll find
a cure for this virus.

1324
01:21:07,796 --> 01:21:10,765
This is for Deyah Kingston.

1325
01:21:17,038 --> 01:21:18,733
Christopher.

1326
01:21:24,846 --> 01:21:27,474
- For Amare's parents.
- Viv and Trey.

1327
01:21:32,787 --> 01:21:35,722
Amare.

1328
01:21:44,799 --> 01:21:46,790
Colleen.

1329
01:21:48,003 --> 01:21:49,937
Edna.

1330
01:21:56,711 --> 01:21:59,407
Amy.

1331
01:22:01,716 --> 01:22:03,206
Lawrence.

1332
01:22:05,520 --> 01:22:07,420
Maria.
