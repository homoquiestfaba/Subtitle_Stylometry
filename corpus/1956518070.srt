00:48:43,659 --> 00:48:45,444
When my grandmother
had cancer,

369
00:48:45,444 --> 00:48:47,098
my family didn"t tell her.

370
00:48:49,404 --> 00:48:51,711
Isn"t it wrong to lie?

371
00:48:51,711 --> 00:48:54,148
[Doctor Song] I mean, if it"s for
good, it"s not really a lie.

372
00:48:54,148 --> 00:48:56,324
[Billi] I mean,
it"s still a lie.

373
00:48:56,324 --> 00:48:58,152
It"s a good lie.

374
00:48:59,501 --> 00:49:01,416
How"s your grandmother?

375
00:49:01,416 --> 00:49:04,202
She passed away, a few months

[in English] Nai Nai should
not be organizing this wedding.

00:53:42,610 --> 00:53:45,526
Well, if she enjoys it,
then just let her do it.

409
00:53:45,526 --> 00:53:47,093
She"s sick.

410
00:53:47,093 --> 00:53:49,095
She should be resting
or in a hospital.

411
00:53:49,095 --> 00:53:50,575
Not stressing
about a fake wedding.

412
00:53:50,575 --> 00:53:52,403
You really don"t know
your Nai Nai.

413
00:53:52,403 --> 00:53:55,580
You know she enjoys
bossing everyone around.

414

Makes her feel important.

- Mom.
- It"s true!

417
00:54:01,586 --> 00:54:04,806
That"s why she hated to stay
in America in our house.

418
00:54:04,806 --> 00:54:08,027
You know? Because she could
not tell anyone what to do.

419
00:54:08,027 --> 00:54:10,682
Whatever I do,
never good enough for her.

420
00:54:10,682 --> 00:54:14,163
But she can"t say anything,
because it was my house.

421
00:54:14,163 --> 00:54:15,426
Mom, stop!

422
00:54:15,426 --> 00:54:16,775

I don"t have a problem with her.
She"s the one that have a problem with me!

426
00:54:23,347 --> 00:54:26,219
She "s dying. Can" t you be
a little more sensitive?

427
00:54:26,219 --> 00:54:28,352
What you want from me?
To scream and cry like you?

428
00:54:35,010 --> 00:54:37,752
You know, when my father died,
I also very sad.

429
00:54:37,752 --> 00:54:39,798
But I don"t act like you.

430
00:54:41,930 --> 00:54:44,106
When I went back to China
for the funeral,

431
00:54:44,106 --> 00:54:45,934
everybody was watching me.

432
00:54:45,934 --> 00:54:48,459
They all were expecting me
to fall apart.

433
00:54:48,459 --> 00:54:50,548
And they think if I don"t
cry, I don"t love my father.

434
00:54:50,548 --> 00:54:52,637
No one"s asking you to cry!

00:55:04,344 --> 00:55:06,477
put all my emotion on display.

438
00:55:06,477 --> 00:55:08,305
Like I"m in the zoo.

439
00:55:10,219 --> 00:55:13,571
But in here, if you don"t cry,
you don"t put a show,

440
00:55:13,571 --> 00:55:15,616
they think that
you don"t love your family.

441
00:55:15,616 --> 00:55:18,619
You know, in here,
they even hire some professional criers.

442
00:55:18,619 --> 00:55:20,012
Just to show how sad they are.

443
00:55:20,012 --> 00:55:21,796
It"s just so ridiculous.

444
00:55:21,796 --> 00:55:22,841

[Jian] So you just stay here.
And what?

503
01:04:18,985 --> 01:04:20,378
Wait for her to die?

504
01:04:21,770 --> 01:04:23,381
What about the fellowship?

01:04:23,381 --> 01:04:25,513
Just forget about it, huh?

506
01:04:25,513 --> 01:04:27,254
You"re 30 years old,

507
01:04:27,254 --> 01:04:30,736
but you can stop your life
and stay here?

508
01:04:30,736 --> 01:04:33,217
And every day
she has to look at you,

509
01:04:33,217 --> 01:04:34,871
with that sad-looking face?

510
01:04:34,871 --> 01:04:37,264
That"s not nice
for anybody, right?

511
01:04:40,137 --> 01:04:43,967
You know, one of the few good
memories of my childhood

512
01:04:43,967 --> 01:04:46,317
were those summers
at Nai Nai"s.

513
01:04:46,317 --> 01:04:47,709
They had that garden.

514
01:04:47,709 --> 01:04:50,625
Ye Ye and I would
catch dragonflies.

01:04:50,625 --> 01:04:52,149
[sniffles]

516
01:04:52,149 --> 01:04:54,325
And then we just moved
to the States.

517
01:04:54,325 --> 01:04:57,154
Everything was different.
Everyone was gone.

518
01:04:57,154 --> 01:05:00,287
And it was just
the three of us.

519
01:05:00,287 --> 01:05:01,332
[sniffles]

520
01:05:05,858 --> 01:05:08,121
I know it was hard.

521
01:05:08,121 --> 01:05:09,644
It was hard for us too.

522
01:05:11,472 --> 01:05:15,520
[sniffles] I wanted to believe
that it was a good thing,

523
01:05:17,739 --> 01:05:21,700
but all I saw
was fear in your eyes.

524
01:05:21,700 --> 01:05:25,486
And I was confused
and scared constantly

525
01:05:25,486 --> 01:05:28,315
because you never told me
what was going on.

526
01:05:33,886 --> 01:05:36,193
And then Ye Ye died.

527
01:05:36,193 --> 01:05:37,934
You didn"t even tell me
he was sick.

528
01:05:39,326 --> 01:05:41,502
So it felt like he just

529
01:05:41,502 --> 01:05:42,721
vanished suddenly.

530
01:05:44,505 --> 01:05:46,420
And you wouldn"t even let me
go to his funeral.

531
01:05:46,420 --> 01:05:47,813
You were at school.

532
01:05:47,813 --> 01:05:49,597
We didn"t want you
to miss school.

533
01:05:49,597 --> 01:05:51,382
We did what we thought
was best for you.

534
01:05:51,382 --> 01:05:52,774
But I never saw him again.

535
01:05:54,820 --> 01:05:56,648
And every time
I came back to China,

536
01:05:56,648 --> 01:05:58,693
he just...
he just wasn"t there anymore.

537
01:06:00,478 --> 01:06:03,524
[sniffles] And I come back
and he"s just gone.

538
01:06:05,439 --> 01:06:09,443
The house is gone,
A Die"s gone,

539
01:06:09,443 --> 01:06:12,620
our Beijing home is gone,
and soon she"ll be gone, too.
