1
00:01:28,922 --> 00:01:30,355
we can leave our
shit here, right?

2
00:01:30,423 --> 00:01:31,788
yeah, we're coming
back tomorrow.

3
00:01:31,858 --> 00:01:33,257
directions to my place.

4
00:01:33,326 --> 00:01:34,759
l don't need them.
l printed them out.

5
00:01:34,828 --> 00:01:36,261
- you take the harrison-
- l'm cool.

6
00:01:36,329 --> 00:01:38,729
hey, j.d., you can
park your motorcycle

7
00:01:38,798 --> 00:01:39,765
right in front of my car.

8
00:01:39,833 --> 00:01:40,891
there's a little space
right there.

9
00:01:40,967 --> 00:01:41,991
my bike's in the shop.

10
00:01:42,068 --> 00:01:43,433
l think l'm gonna
take a pass on tonight.

11
00:01:43,503 --> 00:01:44,492
why?

12
00:01:44,571 --> 00:01:45,970
l've got things to do.

13
00:01:46,039 --> 00:01:47,131
your ''things'' can wait.

14
00:01:47,207 --> 00:01:48,868
you committed.

15
00:01:49,342 --> 00:01:50,400
bitch.

16
00:01:50,477 --> 00:01:52,775
game player -
wants us to beg.

17
00:01:52,846 --> 00:01:53,904
l'll beg.

18
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:55,948
j.d., you can
ride with me.

19
00:02:43,396 --> 00:02:44,624
sorry.

20
00:02:45,565 --> 00:02:49,695
columns, naked statues,
and not one fucking window.

21
00:03:09,022 --> 00:03:10,489
kris?

22
00:03:10,557 --> 00:03:12,422
l'm in the bathroom!

23
00:03:18,264 --> 00:03:19,561
how are they?

24
00:03:19,632 --> 00:03:21,532
l've smelled better.

25
00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:25,494
what is that?

26
00:03:25,572 --> 00:03:26,800
a hit of e.

27
00:03:26,873 --> 00:03:28,932
one hit of e.

28
00:03:30,043 --> 00:03:31,567
l'm just gonna go
put some clothes on.

29
00:03:31,644 --> 00:03:32,611
okay.

30
00:03:32,679 --> 00:03:34,044
didn't your mother
teach you how to share?

31
00:03:34,113 --> 00:03:35,546
she was a selfish bitch.

32
00:03:35,615 --> 00:03:36,775
hey.

33
00:03:36,849 --> 00:03:38,612
do you want a
nice evening?

34
00:03:38,685 --> 00:03:40,846
or a 'let's see how far
we can go' evening?

35
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:43,855
unless it ends in sex,
it's all bullshit right?

36
00:03:43,923 --> 00:03:46,084
then l suggest you cut
that up into four pieces.

37
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:47,888
cut what into
four pieces?

38
00:03:47,961 --> 00:03:50,395
that hit of x he was
about to do himself.

39
00:03:50,463 --> 00:03:53,330
- fork it over, baby.
- fork it over, baby.

40
00:03:59,172 --> 00:04:01,333
open your mouth.

41
00:04:01,407 --> 00:04:03,466
put out your tongue.

42
00:04:05,845 --> 00:04:07,244
say ah!

43
00:04:07,313 --> 00:04:09,042
ah.

44
00:04:10,783 --> 00:04:12,250
who gets rafe's quarter?

45
00:04:12,318 --> 00:04:13,512
pick me, pick me.

46
00:04:13,586 --> 00:04:14,883
lt's my fucking e.

47
00:04:14,954 --> 00:04:15,921
wait.

48
00:04:15,989 --> 00:04:17,354
why shouldn't we
give it to rafe?

49
00:04:17,423 --> 00:04:18,754
he's detoxing
or something.

50
00:04:18,825 --> 00:04:20,486
why, is he sick?

51
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:21,720
you're retarded, man.

52
00:04:21,794 --> 00:04:22,783
what?

53
00:04:22,862 --> 00:04:24,921
some guys just
like to be healthy.

54
00:04:24,998 --> 00:04:26,761
sounds fucking
boring to me.

55
00:04:26,833 --> 00:04:28,198
could you leave
so l can dress?

56
00:04:28,268 --> 00:04:29,394
sure you don't
need any help?

57
00:04:29,469 --> 00:04:31,369
get out!

58
00:04:36,509 --> 00:04:39,478
something for my
little friend the fag.

59
00:04:51,257 --> 00:04:52,451
totally forgot about food,

60
00:04:52,525 --> 00:04:54,288
so if you're hungry we're
gonna have to order in.

61
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:55,793
this is fine for
me now, thanks.

62
00:04:55,862 --> 00:04:57,523
l borrowed a t
if you don't mind.

63
00:04:57,597 --> 00:04:58,962
l don't mind.

64
00:04:59,032 --> 00:05:01,330
might not have food,
but l have plenty of liquor!

65
00:05:01,401 --> 00:05:02,390
who wants a drink?

66
00:05:02,468 --> 00:05:05,028
l'm in a sour mood
so l'd like a sour drink.

67
00:05:05,104 --> 00:05:06,696
tall glass filled
with vodka.

68
00:05:06,773 --> 00:05:08,104
good vodka.

69
00:05:08,174 --> 00:05:09,869
soda if you have it.

70
00:05:09,942 --> 00:05:12,342
l forgot how palatial
this place is.

71
00:05:12,412 --> 00:05:13,606
how come you still
have the sets up

72
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,011
from that porno we did?
what was it called?

73
00:05:15,081 --> 00:05:16,139
''womb raiders.''

74
00:05:16,215 --> 00:05:17,204
''ln diana jones.''

75
00:05:17,283 --> 00:05:18,443
''spurtacus.''

76
00:05:18,518 --> 00:05:21,043
lt was ''who's afraid
of virginia's cooch.''

77
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,485
l don't know -
l was home sick.

78
00:05:22,555 --> 00:05:23,920
kind of reminds
me of vegas.

79
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:25,514
what happened
to you, rafe?

80
00:05:25,591 --> 00:05:26,956
l haven't heard
from you in months.

81
00:05:27,026 --> 00:05:28,584
started school.
decided to get a degree.

82
00:05:28,661 --> 00:05:29,889
what's your major?

83
00:05:29,962 --> 00:05:31,987
women's studies.

84
00:05:32,765 --> 00:05:34,824
what's a gay man doing
studying women's issues?

85
00:05:34,901 --> 00:05:36,027
what's wrong with that?

86
00:05:36,102 --> 00:05:38,070
- l don't get it.
- lt's not weird.

87
00:05:38,137 --> 00:05:40,128
what does a gay man
want to know about women?

88
00:05:40,206 --> 00:05:41,639
how to thoroughly
defeat us?

89
00:05:41,708 --> 00:05:43,141
you're doing a fine
job without me.

90
00:05:43,209 --> 00:05:44,836
- see?
- she's baiting you, rafe.

91
00:05:44,911 --> 00:05:45,843
that's not what l meant.

92
00:05:45,912 --> 00:05:47,106
and you know if you're
in man-hater mode,

93
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:48,704
l've had a long day and don't
want to get into this shit.

94
00:05:48,781 --> 00:05:50,772
l'm just saying...
but man-hater?

95
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:52,044
shouldn't you be
supportive of a man

96
00:05:52,118 --> 00:05:53,278
wanting to know
more about women?

97
00:05:53,353 --> 00:05:54,684
why should l
be supportive?

98
00:05:54,754 --> 00:05:56,278
because l could somehow
make a contribution?

99
00:05:56,356 --> 00:05:57,846
who asked you to?

100
00:05:57,924 --> 00:05:59,016
l'm not being mean.

101
00:05:59,092 --> 00:06:00,423
just playing
devil's advocate.

102
00:06:00,493 --> 00:06:02,461
no other woman l know
thinks it's weird.

103
00:06:02,528 --> 00:06:03,927
maybe they're
humoring you.

104
00:06:03,996 --> 00:06:05,429
l think you're useless
unless you can

105
00:06:05,498 --> 00:06:06,829
sleep with both sexes.

106
00:06:06,899 --> 00:06:07,957
what?

107
00:06:08,034 --> 00:06:09,865
just trying to
change the subject.

108
00:06:09,936 --> 00:06:11,528
so what you're really
saying is that we're only

109
00:06:11,604 --> 00:06:13,765
enlightened if we like
everybody's sex organs?

110
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:15,831
especially the
parts we can suck.

111
00:06:15,908 --> 00:06:17,876
l will say that if you've
got a bigger dick

112
00:06:17,944 --> 00:06:20,242
than a guy, it's guaranteed
that he'll go down on you first.

113
00:06:20,313 --> 00:06:21,974
- nasty.
- why?

114
00:06:22,048 --> 00:06:24,278
lt's just misplaced
maternal projections.

115
00:06:24,350 --> 00:06:26,341
do you suck a pussy
or do you lick it?

116
00:06:26,419 --> 00:06:27,784
the quandary!

117
00:06:27,854 --> 00:06:29,481
the wisdom keeps coming.

118
00:06:29,555 --> 00:06:31,546
a man not afraid of
eating out a woman

119
00:06:31,624 --> 00:06:33,421
is a man not afraid of women!

120
00:06:33,493 --> 00:06:36,189
many straight guys won't go
down on it and you know it.

121
00:06:36,262 --> 00:06:38,856
fyl, ''it's''
called a vagina.

122
00:06:38,931 --> 00:06:43,027
so j.d., do you like
suckling breasts?

123
00:06:43,102 --> 00:06:44,729
l'm a breast guy.

124
00:06:44,804 --> 00:06:46,294
yeah, but do you
eat out a pussy?

125
00:06:46,372 --> 00:06:48,033
god, it just rolls
off the tongue.

126
00:06:48,107 --> 00:06:49,938
finger-licking good.

127
00:06:50,009 --> 00:06:51,704
- you're vile.
- l responded.

128
00:06:51,778 --> 00:06:53,769
so you like a woman
in her totality?

129
00:06:53,846 --> 00:06:54,710
totally.

130
00:06:54,781 --> 00:06:56,043
you don't reduce
her to body parts?

131
00:06:56,115 --> 00:06:57,309
l love breasts
and l have

132
00:06:57,383 --> 00:06:59,078
no problem whatsoever
with pussy.

133
00:06:59,152 --> 00:07:01,017
but l've never seen
you with a fat girl.

134
00:07:01,087 --> 00:07:02,315
so what?

135
00:07:02,388 --> 00:07:03,855
she's still a woman.

136
00:07:03,923 --> 00:07:04,981
you wouldn't
date a fat girl?

137
00:07:05,057 --> 00:07:07,184
l'd let her suck my dick as
long as she wasn't grotesque.

138
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:08,659
trust me -
you're not enlightened.

139
00:07:08,728 --> 00:07:10,628
that's a very nice
way of putting it.

140
00:07:10,696 --> 00:07:13,187
l don't see why you're
all obsessed with fat.

141
00:07:13,266 --> 00:07:15,234
lesbians don't
care so much.

142
00:07:15,301 --> 00:07:16,996
because they're all fat.

143
00:07:17,069 --> 00:07:18,400
like me?

144
00:07:18,471 --> 00:07:21,133
besides, l've loved
many fat girls.

145
00:07:21,207 --> 00:07:22,936
doesn't make you
enlightened according to

146
00:07:23,009 --> 00:07:25,409
this lame-ass,
suck-me theory.

147
00:07:25,478 --> 00:07:28,936
a guy puts his dick in your
face, you'd bite it off.

148
00:07:29,015 --> 00:07:30,380
yeah, but you haven't
sucked one either

149
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:32,042
so don't go getting high
and mighty with me.

150
00:07:32,118 --> 00:07:34,416
nope...not going
against nature.

151
00:07:34,487 --> 00:07:35,511
here we go.

152
00:07:35,588 --> 00:07:37,419
going against nature
totally excludes oral sex

153
00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:38,980
from the equation then?

154
00:07:39,058 --> 00:07:41,856
l'm sure many women will
be relieved to know

155
00:07:41,928 --> 00:07:43,725
they don't have to hear,

156
00:07:43,796 --> 00:07:47,197
''suck it harder, not so hard,
now lick my balls.''

157
00:07:47,266 --> 00:07:50,531
blow jobs, lesbian sex,
and doggie-style are all fine.

158
00:07:50,603 --> 00:07:53,367
but fat chicks and
butt-fucking dudes

159
00:07:53,439 --> 00:07:55,270
just doesn't fly right by me.

160
00:07:55,341 --> 00:07:58,208
let's talk about the glandular
surprise in your ass.

161
00:07:58,277 --> 00:07:59,938
dude, you're disturbing me.

162
00:08:00,012 --> 00:08:01,741
women can hit it too.

163
00:08:01,814 --> 00:08:03,839
just you try going near
a straight guy's asshole.

164
00:08:03,916 --> 00:08:05,076
just you try.

165
00:08:05,151 --> 00:08:07,176
yeah -- stay away
from my asshole!

166
00:08:07,253 --> 00:08:09,346
no decent girl wants to
go near that dirty thing.

167
00:08:09,422 --> 00:08:10,548
fuck you, already.

168
00:08:10,623 --> 00:08:12,614
wait, isn't the point of sex
to christians like j.d.

169
00:08:12,692 --> 00:08:14,023
about procreation anyway?

170
00:08:14,093 --> 00:08:15,492
that's why we call
you guys breeders -

171
00:08:15,561 --> 00:08:17,085
you think it's your job.

172
00:08:17,163 --> 00:08:20,030
l'm not christian.
l'm catholic.

173
00:08:20,099 --> 00:08:22,090
l think it's
actually very simple.

174
00:08:22,168 --> 00:08:24,193
we're sexual creatures.

175
00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:26,135
ultimately, we could take
it anyway we can get it.

176
00:08:26,205 --> 00:08:27,570
penguins mate for life.

177
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:28,902
you're not a penguin.

178
00:08:28,975 --> 00:08:31,136
we're closest to apes, actually,
and they don't mate for life.

179
00:08:31,210 --> 00:08:33,610
well, fucking everything that
moves won't solve anything.

180
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:35,112
l think the queer
roman priests tried

181
00:08:35,181 --> 00:08:36,648
and it didn't work out
so well for them.

182
00:08:36,716 --> 00:08:38,343
so you really do think
women are perfect?

183
00:08:38,417 --> 00:08:42,114
lsn't every crime against
humanity committed by a man?

184
00:08:42,188 --> 00:08:44,156
a sexually frustrated man
who turns to his knife

185
00:08:44,223 --> 00:08:46,350
or his gun or his bomb
to destroy what he can't

186
00:08:46,425 --> 00:08:48,791
reconcile what's
in himself?

187
00:08:48,861 --> 00:08:51,728
something tells me this is
going to be a long evening.

188
00:08:51,797 --> 00:08:54,960
be honest with yourself.
estrogen doesn't make us happy.

189
00:08:55,034 --> 00:08:56,558
be honest with your self.

190
00:08:56,636 --> 00:08:59,127
women have been
the ultimate rape victims

191
00:08:59,205 --> 00:09:01,264
and christianity
the ultimate penis.

192
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:03,205
you can't tell me
that's not true.

193
00:09:03,276 --> 00:09:04,573
and you're not
a man-hater because...?

194
00:09:04,644 --> 00:09:06,271
continuation of this
argument implies that she

195
00:09:06,345 --> 00:09:07,937
is afraid of giving up control.

196
00:09:08,014 --> 00:09:09,743
and you're not
a control freak?

197
00:09:09,815 --> 00:09:12,147
the beauty of life is often
found when we give up control.

198
00:09:12,218 --> 00:09:13,742
confucius say...

199
00:09:13,819 --> 00:09:15,480
can we change
the subject?

200
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:17,045
why?
afraid you're gonna go to hell?

201
00:09:17,123 --> 00:09:19,216
maybe.
guilt by association.

202
00:09:19,292 --> 00:09:20,520
fuck hell.

203
00:09:20,593 --> 00:09:22,185
and by the way,
fuck your male god.

204
00:09:22,261 --> 00:09:23,626
step back, girls.

205
00:09:23,696 --> 00:09:25,630
lightning's about to
rip through the ceiling.

206
00:09:25,698 --> 00:09:26,995
l'm not scared.

207
00:09:27,066 --> 00:09:29,534
your god's aim ain't that
great, if you think about it.

208
00:09:31,637 --> 00:09:35,004
[phone ringing]

209
00:09:38,711 --> 00:09:40,804
hey, can you hang on?

210
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:45,277
god damn!

211
00:09:45,351 --> 00:09:47,842
has she always been
such an angry bitch?

212
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,046
rafe, are you okay?

213
00:09:49,121 --> 00:09:51,214
l...need something more
to eat or something.

214
00:09:51,290 --> 00:09:53,053
help yourself.

215
00:09:55,995 --> 00:09:58,361
are you gonna hog
that thing or what?

216
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:02,659
thank you.
l did miss you guys.

217
00:10:02,735 --> 00:10:04,794
lt's so hard to find
anyone to talk to anymore.

218
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:06,735
mental masturbation
between three hormonal

219
00:10:06,806 --> 00:10:09,502
bitches is not my
idea of a good time.

220
00:10:09,575 --> 00:10:11,270
you need to quit talking
in stereotypes,

221
00:10:11,344 --> 00:10:13,369
even if it is in jest.

222
00:10:13,446 --> 00:10:15,004
- kris?
- what?

223
00:10:15,081 --> 00:10:17,242
free fucking country!

224
00:10:18,217 --> 00:10:20,344
don't be such a brute.

225
00:10:20,419 --> 00:10:23,752
l think you might enjoy
what's about to happen.

226
00:10:36,402 --> 00:10:38,495
so you're blowing
me off for her?

227
00:10:39,405 --> 00:10:41,600
fine.
call me later.

228
00:10:41,674 --> 00:10:43,904
l'm sure you'll be around!

229
00:10:55,354 --> 00:10:57,481
- you okay?
- never better.

230
00:10:57,556 --> 00:10:58,716
l should probably
get going.

231
00:10:58,791 --> 00:10:59,985
l'm not really
feeling that great.

232
00:11:00,059 --> 00:11:01,287
you're not leaving me
alone with that one.

233
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:02,725
now see - you talk like
you don't like me,

234
00:11:02,795 --> 00:11:04,023
but you do.

235
00:11:04,096 --> 00:11:07,293
of course l like you.
you amuse me.

236
00:11:07,366 --> 00:11:10,460
that was supposed to be
a cut, but it doesn't matter.

237
00:11:10,536 --> 00:11:15,337
'cause l've got a nice buzz on
and l'm all about the love.

238
00:11:15,408 --> 00:11:16,966
now if you'll excuse me,

239
00:11:17,043 --> 00:11:19,773
l have to go to the
little girl's room.

240
00:11:19,845 --> 00:11:22,279
aim carefully.
rosa just cleaned my floors.

241
00:11:22,348 --> 00:11:24,339
better yet -
just sit.

242
00:11:24,417 --> 00:11:26,977
why do you have two
eights on your wall?

243
00:11:27,053 --> 00:11:28,543
they're hearts.

244
00:11:28,621 --> 00:11:31,522
- where?
- on my wall.

245
00:11:33,626 --> 00:11:34,991
what are they, really?

246
00:11:35,061 --> 00:11:37,393
a doorway to higher
consciousness.

247
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:42,665
you okay?

248
00:11:42,735 --> 00:11:44,134
they're giving
me a headache.

249
00:11:44,203 --> 00:11:45,295
let's just leave then.

250
00:11:45,371 --> 00:11:46,633
when things could
get interesting?

251
00:11:46,706 --> 00:11:47,695
even though you
have a headache?

252
00:11:47,773 --> 00:11:49,604
you a fucking
girl scout now?

253
00:11:49,675 --> 00:11:53,839
sorry, the sarcasm.
lt's that fucking bitch.

254
00:11:54,780 --> 00:11:57,749
so...what's been
going on with you,

255
00:11:57,817 --> 00:12:00,377
besides, um, school.

256
00:12:00,453 --> 00:12:01,750
you seeing anyone?

257
00:12:01,821 --> 00:12:03,812
you know how long it's been
since l've been in love?

258
00:12:03,889 --> 00:12:05,083
you're not
missing anything.

259
00:12:05,157 --> 00:12:06,385
but l am though.

260
00:12:06,459 --> 00:12:08,723
l only fall in love with guys
who remind me of jimmy schwab.

261
00:12:08,794 --> 00:12:09,886
who's that?

262
00:12:09,962 --> 00:12:13,591
just some guy before l got
bitter - when l was 14.

263
00:12:13,666 --> 00:12:15,827
lsn't it funny -
the love of our lives

264
00:12:15,901 --> 00:12:17,892
is always the one who
never loves us back.

265
00:12:17,970 --> 00:12:19,028
that's just it, though.

266
00:12:19,105 --> 00:12:20,766
he could have loved me
if l had let him.

267
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:22,740
there's always that.

268
00:12:29,014 --> 00:12:30,481
what other drugs
are you on, j.d.?

269
00:12:30,549 --> 00:12:31,743
you look beat up.

270
00:12:31,817 --> 00:12:33,682
why l'm sure l don't
know what you mean.

271
00:12:33,753 --> 00:12:35,015
l'm sure.

272
00:12:35,087 --> 00:12:36,645
so j.d. -
getting back to it...

273
00:12:36,722 --> 00:12:40,214
what exactly is your
beef with gay sex?

274
00:12:40,292 --> 00:12:42,385
l've already spoken my
peace on the situation.

275
00:12:42,461 --> 00:12:44,326
lt's a matter of ac/dc.

276
00:12:44,396 --> 00:12:45,658
you talk like
that makes sense.

277
00:12:45,731 --> 00:12:47,028
but with a lot of lube,
my dick would fit

278
00:12:47,099 --> 00:12:49,124
in your ass easier
than her vagina.

279
00:12:49,201 --> 00:12:52,568
what if...we're all
fucking bisexuals?

280
00:12:52,638 --> 00:12:55,732
l'm not fucking
any bisexuals.

281
00:12:55,808 --> 00:12:58,834
or any hermaphrodites,
for that matter!

282
00:12:58,911 --> 00:13:01,539
bisexuals get on my
last fucking nerve.

283
00:13:01,614 --> 00:13:03,275
why can't you
make a decision?

284
00:13:03,349 --> 00:13:06,318
what if all we really want is
intimacy and sexual pleasure?

285
00:13:06,385 --> 00:13:07,647
our needs are as
simple as that?

286
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:09,551
doesn't matter who
we love, just how?.

287
00:13:09,622 --> 00:13:10,748
exactly.

288
00:13:10,823 --> 00:13:12,222
are you bisexual
now, kris?

289
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:13,656
not officially, but l haven't
closed my mind

290
00:13:13,726 --> 00:13:15,023
to it yet either.

291
00:13:15,094 --> 00:13:17,460
heidi, sure you're
not bisexual?

292
00:13:17,530 --> 00:13:19,998
sorry, no.

293
00:13:20,065 --> 00:13:22,329
rafe?
l already know the answer

294
00:13:22,401 --> 00:13:24,301
to this, but have you
ever slept with a woman?

295
00:13:24,370 --> 00:13:26,099
l kissed a girl
in high school.

296
00:13:26,172 --> 00:13:27,764
she gave me a cold sore.

297
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:29,205
l think about
her every year.

298
00:13:29,275 --> 00:13:31,072
but the pain she gave
me didn't make me gay.

299
00:13:31,143 --> 00:13:33,202
l was gay from the first
moment l masturbated -

300
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:34,940
if you're curious.

301
00:13:35,014 --> 00:13:36,641
so not.

302
00:13:37,550 --> 00:13:40,849
so you totally lost your
argument about bisexuals, kris.

303
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:43,081
you'd be surprised what
l can pull out of my hat.

304
00:13:43,155 --> 00:13:47,114
stop me if l offend
your sensibilities.

305
00:13:59,972 --> 00:14:02,907
okay, kris, you're the
anomaly in this group.

306
00:14:02,975 --> 00:14:05,773
or am l the most
advanced sexual creature?

307
00:14:05,845 --> 00:14:07,972
okay, that was pretty hot.

308
00:14:08,047 --> 00:14:10,607
but what is this -
a new party game?

309
00:14:10,683 --> 00:14:12,480
we make it
up as we go along.

310
00:14:12,551 --> 00:14:15,076
rafe, wanna kiss me?

311
00:14:15,154 --> 00:14:16,587
uh, no.

312
00:14:16,655 --> 00:14:19,419
- but you'd kiss j.d.?
- yeah, but he's a batterer.

313
00:14:19,491 --> 00:14:21,459
fuck that!
l wouldn't hit you.

314
00:14:21,527 --> 00:14:24,018
but l wouldn't
kiss you either.

315
00:14:24,096 --> 00:14:26,496
don't cross my boundaries
and everything's cool.

316
00:14:26,565 --> 00:14:28,226
what about you, heidi?

317
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:30,791
would you kiss one of
these fine young bucks?

318
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:33,862
well it's no big
deal to me - kissing.

319
00:14:33,939 --> 00:14:35,201
but what's your game?

320
00:14:35,274 --> 00:14:37,174
haven't you woken up
and just thought -

321
00:14:37,243 --> 00:14:39,473
damn, l want to
lose my hang-ups?

322
00:14:39,545 --> 00:14:41,740
- not in a long while.
- l don't have any hang-ups.

323
00:14:41,814 --> 00:14:44,578
- you're kidding, right?
- l know what l'm not.

324
00:14:44,650 --> 00:14:46,345
okay, me -
definitely not gay,

325
00:14:46,418 --> 00:14:48,147
so l respect him and all.

326
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:50,780
but l do have a
question for the homos.

327
00:14:50,856 --> 00:14:52,687
does gaydar work?

328
00:14:52,758 --> 00:14:55,249
l mean, can you tell
when someone is gay?

329
00:14:55,327 --> 00:14:56,919
- why, you worried?
-anyway.

330
00:14:56,996 --> 00:14:58,327
l think, if l understand
you correctly,

331
00:14:58,397 --> 00:15:00,194
you're trying to say that
we can all switch sides

332
00:15:00,266 --> 00:15:02,598
if we dig deep enough
and get over our tendencies.

333
00:15:02,668 --> 00:15:03,965
but that's bs.

334
00:15:04,036 --> 00:15:06,095
how can you be so sure you
don't like breasts though?

335
00:15:07,473 --> 00:15:10,670
maybe you're just afraid
of the idea of them.

336
00:15:11,210 --> 00:15:12,336
what are you doing?

337
00:15:12,411 --> 00:15:14,003
lt's okay, honey.
they're harmless.

338
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:15,569
really?
they sent a nation

339
00:15:15,648 --> 00:15:17,912
into a bitch fit
when broadcast on public tv.

340
00:15:17,983 --> 00:15:19,507
come on, baby,
just touch one.

341
00:15:19,585 --> 00:15:22,520
- touch both.
- l'd rather just die.

342
00:15:22,588 --> 00:15:23,418
what?

343
00:15:23,489 --> 00:15:24,786
l'd rather die
than be straight.

344
00:15:24,857 --> 00:15:26,916
lf it's any consolation,
you probably will.

345
00:15:26,992 --> 00:15:28,482
j.d., fuck yourself.

346
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:30,289
you'd rather die
than be loved?

347
00:15:30,362 --> 00:15:32,227
you wouldn't understand.
lt's a sister issue.

348
00:15:32,298 --> 00:15:33,925
no, l don't
have brothers.

349
00:15:33,999 --> 00:15:35,125
you're touching
these, rafe.

350
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:36,132
l'm not touching your--

351
00:15:36,201 --> 00:15:37,259
oh, yes you are!

352
00:15:37,336 --> 00:15:38,735
you're paying god knows
how many thousands

353
00:15:38,804 --> 00:15:41,068
of dollars to study women's
issues, and l'm gonna

354
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:43,540
give you a big,
fat lesson for free!

355
00:15:45,311 --> 00:15:47,939
god, you really do reduce
a woman to body parts.

356
00:15:48,013 --> 00:15:49,503
rafe, seriously.

357
00:15:49,581 --> 00:15:51,572
how could mammary
glands freak you out?

358
00:15:51,650 --> 00:15:52,810
as a baby you
adored them!

359
00:15:52,885 --> 00:15:54,318
l was bottle-fed.

360
00:15:54,386 --> 00:15:56,718
now we know the
source of the problem!

361
00:15:56,789 --> 00:15:58,154
let's just leave it
at the fact l am not

362
00:15:58,223 --> 00:15:59,520
attracted to you sexually.

363
00:15:59,591 --> 00:16:01,559
uh, by the way, l am.

364
00:16:03,462 --> 00:16:06,625
fine, show it for the fag
but not the straight guy.

365
00:16:06,699 --> 00:16:07,825
you're too easy.

366
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:09,492
have you ever considered
that maybe you shouldn't

367
00:16:09,568 --> 00:16:11,297
be fucking around with
his sexuality like that.

368
00:16:11,370 --> 00:16:12,667
why?

369
00:16:12,738 --> 00:16:13,932
l don't know.

370
00:16:14,006 --> 00:16:17,237
l mean make him
straight if you can.

371
00:16:17,309 --> 00:16:19,675
rafe, l just
had a thought.

372
00:16:19,745 --> 00:16:21,508
have you ever considered
that maybe you're not

373
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:23,047
as gay as you think you are?

374
00:16:23,115 --> 00:16:24,639
trust me, l'm gay.

375
00:16:24,717 --> 00:16:26,514
but how do you
really know?.

376
00:16:26,585 --> 00:16:29,145
what if what you think
about yourself isn't true?

377
00:16:29,221 --> 00:16:30,779
but there's so much
bullshit built up

378
00:16:30,856 --> 00:16:32,551
that you don't really
know who you are?

379
00:16:32,624 --> 00:16:34,057
but what would that
mean about you?

380
00:16:34,126 --> 00:16:36,617
after kate,
totally considering hetero.

381
00:16:36,695 --> 00:16:38,356
but not with you.

382
00:16:38,430 --> 00:16:40,159
oh, so you played cootchie-coo

383
00:16:40,232 --> 00:16:42,257
with your titties
for rafe's benefit?

384
00:16:42,334 --> 00:16:44,097
maybe l just like
to feel myself up.

385
00:16:44,169 --> 00:16:47,570
the bottom line is l don't
like your...you know.

386
00:16:47,639 --> 00:16:49,573
thought it just rolled
off the tongue.

387
00:16:49,641 --> 00:16:51,404
pussy. cunt.

388
00:16:51,477 --> 00:16:53,104
scary monster!

389
00:16:53,178 --> 00:16:56,147
but you both have
nice supple titties.

390
00:16:56,215 --> 00:16:57,842
now it's bad 70s porn.

391
00:16:57,916 --> 00:16:59,611
l just don't want to
sink my face into them.

392
00:16:59,685 --> 00:17:01,016
and the vagina--

393
00:17:01,086 --> 00:17:03,919
you have a lot of
research to do, my friend.

394
00:17:03,989 --> 00:17:05,388
j.d.

395
00:17:05,457 --> 00:17:07,288
would you
show us your penis?

396
00:17:08,227 --> 00:17:09,751
huh?

397
00:17:10,229 --> 00:17:11,287
l'm just asking.

398
00:17:11,363 --> 00:17:12,796
you act like a guy
with a really big dick.

399
00:17:12,865 --> 00:17:13,991
kind of curious
if l'm right.

400
00:17:14,066 --> 00:17:15,431
he's got a big one.

401
00:17:15,501 --> 00:17:17,093
what?
l'm a good judge of character.

402
00:17:17,169 --> 00:17:18,932
don't you be
looking at this!

403
00:17:19,004 --> 00:17:21,199
would you show us?

404
00:17:21,273 --> 00:17:22,535
lf you paid me.

405
00:17:22,608 --> 00:17:26,738
l've got a quarter, but l might
need parking money later.

406
00:17:26,812 --> 00:17:29,178
lt's a fucking
gorgeous dick, a'right?

407
00:17:29,248 --> 00:17:30,408
a'right.

408
00:17:30,482 --> 00:17:33,178
so sweet -
a boy and his penis!

409
00:17:33,252 --> 00:17:34,879
what's his name?

410
00:17:34,953 --> 00:17:37,421
l think they're all
called boy scout.

411
00:17:37,489 --> 00:17:39,957
so what's so special
about your penis, honey?

412
00:17:40,025 --> 00:17:41,322
yeah.
and how big?

413
00:17:41,393 --> 00:17:43,293
lt's just a
wonder to look at.

414
00:17:43,362 --> 00:17:46,422
j.d.'s gonna show us
his little soldier.

415
00:17:46,498 --> 00:17:48,625
there's nothing
little about it.

416
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:50,292
l for one have
to see it now.

417
00:17:50,369 --> 00:17:52,564
the anticipation
is killing me.

418
00:17:52,638 --> 00:17:54,936
sorry, not a party trick.

419
00:17:55,007 --> 00:17:57,874
you saw my breasts,
so l deserve to see your dick.

420
00:17:57,943 --> 00:17:59,501
lt's probably just a
sick piece of meat

421
00:17:59,578 --> 00:18:01,045
that goes squirt, squirt.

422
00:18:01,113 --> 00:18:02,876
they're using
reverse psychology.

423
00:18:02,948 --> 00:18:04,882
l for one hope it works.

424
00:18:04,950 --> 00:18:07,578
all right -
l'll show you my dick.

425
00:18:07,653 --> 00:18:10,383
but something's
got to get me hard.

426
00:18:10,456 --> 00:18:11,354
why?

427
00:18:11,423 --> 00:18:12,913
they can't just
plop them out.

428
00:18:12,991 --> 00:18:14,288
lt needs to make
a grand entrance.

429
00:18:14,359 --> 00:18:16,259
maybe they should rename
them all paris hilton.

430
00:18:16,328 --> 00:18:18,193
no, it's true.
l've got a grower not a show-er.

431
00:18:18,263 --> 00:18:19,594
what does that mean?

432
00:18:19,665 --> 00:18:21,895
flaccid his penis is
small and uneventful.

433
00:18:21,967 --> 00:18:23,298
but when it grows...

434
00:18:23,368 --> 00:18:25,563
guys tell me they love
my penis all the time.

435
00:18:25,637 --> 00:18:27,935
that statement was wrong
on a couple of levels.

436
00:18:28,006 --> 00:18:29,439
so whip yours out, too.

437
00:18:29,508 --> 00:18:30,805
we'll see who's
more delusional.

438
00:18:30,876 --> 00:18:32,605
l got your delusions
right here.

439
00:18:32,678 --> 00:18:33,975
show it.

440
00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:36,810
touch each other
and we'll see.

441
00:18:48,327 --> 00:18:49,817
all right...

442
00:18:51,096 --> 00:18:53,656
now move closer and say
''l want you to fuck me.''

443
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:56,299
oh, honey.

444
00:18:56,368 --> 00:18:59,531
l want you to fuck me
like a stallion.

445
00:19:04,443 --> 00:19:06,411
fuckin' good enough.

446
00:19:10,816 --> 00:19:12,408
you've got a helmet!

447
00:19:12,484 --> 00:19:14,111
lt's called foreskin!

448
00:19:14,186 --> 00:19:15,710
lt's bigger than
l anticipated.

449
00:19:15,787 --> 00:19:17,652
l have nothing to
compare it with,

450
00:19:17,723 --> 00:19:20,783
but l could totally do
without the creepy hood.

451
00:19:20,859 --> 00:19:23,487
lt's a really
nice dick, j.d.

452
00:19:28,066 --> 00:19:30,398
ls it a really small one?
poor thing.

453
00:19:30,469 --> 00:19:31,527
fuck you,
emotional piranha.

454
00:19:31,603 --> 00:19:32,865
show it!

455
00:19:32,938 --> 00:19:34,735
- j.d.'s gotta jerk himself.
- what?

456
00:19:34,806 --> 00:19:36,034
beat off -
otherwise l can't do it.

457
00:19:36,108 --> 00:19:37,268
l'm very visual.

458
00:19:37,342 --> 00:19:38,502
dude, l'm not beating
off for you.

459
00:19:38,577 --> 00:19:40,169
that's very faggot-esque.

460
00:19:40,245 --> 00:19:43,146
here, j.d.,
l'll give some stimulus.

461
00:20:05,404 --> 00:20:07,269
l'm kind of impressed.

462
00:20:07,339 --> 00:20:09,671
lf you were a gay man
you'd be all over this.

463
00:20:09,741 --> 00:20:12,767
perfect shape.
perfect size.

464
00:20:12,844 --> 00:20:14,641
mine's bigger than that!

465
00:20:14,713 --> 00:20:17,682
l'm strangely intrigued
by your penis, rafe.

466
00:20:17,749 --> 00:20:20,047
looks like something
the military would hand out.

467
00:20:20,118 --> 00:20:23,781
swift, to the point,
takes care of business.

468
00:20:23,855 --> 00:20:25,880
you're all missing
the grand point,

469
00:20:25,958 --> 00:20:28,449
which is that this
is a beautiful dick -

470
00:20:28,527 --> 00:20:31,291
which, by the way,
needs to take a piss.

471
00:20:31,363 --> 00:20:33,228
lt's no big thing.
lt doesn't matter.

472
00:20:33,298 --> 00:20:34,663
friends?

473
00:20:36,935 --> 00:20:38,994
you just slapped him
like a little girl.

474
00:20:39,071 --> 00:20:41,631
l got confused.
l didn't want to punch him!

475
00:20:41,707 --> 00:20:44,005
real ladylike, asshole!

476
00:20:44,076 --> 00:20:46,408
l think it's time
for your big fucking exit.

477
00:20:46,478 --> 00:20:47,877
at the very
least a time out.

478
00:20:47,946 --> 00:20:49,436
l'm not into what
you just did!

479
00:20:49,514 --> 00:20:51,709
lt was a hand - on your
''beautiful'' package!

480
00:20:51,783 --> 00:20:53,307
you were really
proud of it, j.d.

481
00:20:53,385 --> 00:20:55,512
maybe pride got
the better of you?

482
00:20:55,587 --> 00:20:57,885
what if l came up to you
and grabbed your vagina?

483
00:20:57,956 --> 00:20:59,719
just call it what you
really think it is;

484
00:20:59,791 --> 00:21:01,383
a bicked and ugly pussy!

485
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:02,518
what the fuck is bicked?

486
00:21:02,594 --> 00:21:04,061
don't you shave?

487
00:21:04,129 --> 00:21:06,791
dude, l'm sorry, really.
a'right?

488
00:21:06,865 --> 00:21:08,492
l just reacted and you're
all being

489
00:21:08,567 --> 00:21:13,027
purposefully antagonistical.
why would you think that's cool?

490
00:21:13,105 --> 00:21:15,300
l knew what you would do.
l'm a couple steps ahead of you.

491
00:21:15,374 --> 00:21:18,207
oh, god, you know what?
you're fucking just like them!

492
00:21:18,277 --> 00:21:19,539
emotionally abusive and all.

493
00:21:19,611 --> 00:21:20,578
did l hurt your feelings?

494
00:21:20,646 --> 00:21:21,977
or maybe you're trying
to recapture things

495
00:21:22,047 --> 00:21:23,071
with jimmy schwab.

496
00:21:23,148 --> 00:21:24,274
that was a
confidence thing.

497
00:21:24,349 --> 00:21:25,646
or maybe you did
what you just did

498
00:21:25,717 --> 00:21:27,048
because you're being
manipulative.

499
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:28,609
maybe l've been learning
from my studies.

500
00:21:28,687 --> 00:21:30,382
l'm not letting you
manipulate me...

501
00:21:30,455 --> 00:21:34,653
and l didn't mean to hit you.
lt startled me, was all.

502
00:21:34,726 --> 00:21:36,216
lt's inescapable.

503
00:21:36,295 --> 00:21:38,695
hateful little men
with too big 'a dicks!

504
00:21:38,764 --> 00:21:39,822
whack 'em all!

505
00:21:39,898 --> 00:21:41,229
you know what.
you know what?

506
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:44,269
fine.
touch it!

507
00:21:45,771 --> 00:21:48,934
lt won't bother me
if l'm expecting it.

508
00:21:49,007 --> 00:21:50,338
and then l can prove
to all of you

509
00:21:50,409 --> 00:21:52,104
that l'm not the kind of
person you're trying

510
00:21:52,177 --> 00:21:53,303
to make me think l am.

511
00:21:53,378 --> 00:21:54,743
you just proved
us right though.

512
00:21:54,813 --> 00:21:55,905
oh god, shut up.

513
00:21:55,981 --> 00:21:57,573
sorry -- didn't want to
ruin your ''master plan.''

514
00:21:57,649 --> 00:21:59,284
l can't believe l'm doing
this, but come here.

515
00:21:59,284 --> 00:21:59,875
l can't believe l'm doing
this, but come here.

516
00:22:01,153 --> 00:22:03,018
fucking neanderthal.

517
00:22:04,489 --> 00:22:06,616
look, man,
l like you a lot.

518
00:22:06,692 --> 00:22:09,024
you're a cool guy
and l didn't mean to hit you.

519
00:22:09,094 --> 00:22:12,222
and while l don't
want to turn you on,

520
00:22:12,297 --> 00:22:15,266
l want to prove to you
that l'm not a man-hater.

521
00:22:17,002 --> 00:22:19,766
- so just do it.
- what?

522
00:22:19,838 --> 00:22:21,772
we're gonna touch
each other's dicks.

523
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:23,831
l'm not interested
in your flaccid penis.

524
00:22:23,909 --> 00:22:27,470
mine won't be flaccid...
and neither will yours.

525
00:22:27,546 --> 00:22:29,480
who's going to get
you hard, j.d.?

526
00:22:29,548 --> 00:22:30,913
- heidi.
- fuck you.

527
00:22:30,982 --> 00:22:32,540
no, no, no!

528
00:22:32,617 --> 00:22:34,949
now that we're breaking
everybody's boundaries,

529
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:39,514
l think it's time
you felt a man's dick.

530
00:22:39,591 --> 00:22:42,754
you're gonaa get me hard,

531
00:22:42,828 --> 00:22:45,388
and then rafe is
gonna touch it.

532
00:22:45,464 --> 00:22:47,159
just touch it.

533
00:22:47,232 --> 00:22:49,598
like l'm holding a big,
fat piece of salami?

534
00:22:49,668 --> 00:22:52,000
yeah, only without
the smelling.

535
00:22:52,070 --> 00:22:54,800
l'm confused - who's trying
to prove what to who?

536
00:22:54,873 --> 00:22:56,465
that l'm not
afraid of dicks.

537
00:22:56,541 --> 00:22:59,305
l'm just am afraid of what
he wants to do with mine.

538
00:22:59,378 --> 00:23:01,209
but if we all understand
the ground rules

539
00:23:01,279 --> 00:23:03,873
and nothing is gonna be
done but a nice handhold,

540
00:23:03,949 --> 00:23:06,383
then we can put all
this behind us

541
00:23:06,451 --> 00:23:08,442
and get back to the
fucking kumbaya.

542
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:10,010
at this rate someone's
gonna end up dead.

543
00:23:10,088 --> 00:23:12,113
- or pregnant.
- scared?

544
00:23:12,190 --> 00:23:15,284
l'm not scared of
the big, bad dick!

545
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:17,487
you want me to grab it?

546
00:23:17,562 --> 00:23:19,894
run my fingers up
and down its bulky

547
00:23:19,965 --> 00:23:22,559
and somewhat unshapely length?

548
00:23:22,634 --> 00:23:25,728
by the way,
l'm not touching the helmet.

549
00:23:25,804 --> 00:23:27,362
grow up, already.

550
00:23:33,278 --> 00:23:36,042
pretend that
l'm your lover.

551
00:23:36,114 --> 00:23:40,744
and that this
is my bicked pussy.

552
00:23:49,661 --> 00:23:51,322
- okay, now just-
- shut up.

553
00:23:55,667 --> 00:23:57,931
unzip my pants.

554
00:24:03,375 --> 00:24:05,502
get on your knees.

555
00:24:08,713 --> 00:24:11,181
and quit sighing.

556
00:24:13,752 --> 00:24:19,622
now pull down my shorts...
slow.

557
00:24:23,995 --> 00:24:25,257
okay, there.

558
00:24:25,330 --> 00:24:26,456
no, if l'm going to
touch his dick,

559
00:24:26,531 --> 00:24:28,431
you need to stay there.

560
00:24:29,401 --> 00:24:31,198
now cup my balls.

561
00:24:31,269 --> 00:24:33,829
but don't yank 'em -
l mean it.

562
00:24:35,507 --> 00:24:38,806
okay, now reach over
and unzip his pants.

563
00:24:42,314 --> 00:24:44,578
now pull out your dick.

564
00:24:54,726 --> 00:24:56,557
okay, now cup his balls.

565
00:24:59,531 --> 00:25:01,499
now here's what
l want you to do.

566
00:25:01,566 --> 00:25:04,330
l want you to
reach over and grab it.

567
00:25:04,402 --> 00:25:06,495
no movement.

568
00:25:12,544 --> 00:25:14,375
okay, here goes...

569
00:25:14,446 --> 00:25:16,676
- lt doesn't bite.
- could do some spitting.

570
00:25:16,748 --> 00:25:18,181
fuck you!

571
00:25:29,928 --> 00:25:32,260
congrats, j.d. -
you're no longer straight.

572
00:25:32,330 --> 00:25:33,763
bullshit.

573
00:25:33,832 --> 00:25:36,300
lf you had any more precum
l'd have to call for rosa.

574
00:25:36,368 --> 00:25:38,268
l always get precum
with my erection.

575
00:25:38,336 --> 00:25:40,634
and that whole
jerk-jerk bit.

576
00:25:40,705 --> 00:25:42,070
he could have jerked
you off in seconds.

577
00:25:42,140 --> 00:25:43,300
because she was there.

578
00:25:43,375 --> 00:25:44,740
oh, your point?

579
00:25:44,809 --> 00:25:47,004
securely straight.

580
00:25:47,078 --> 00:25:49,410
lying bisexual.
you want him.

581
00:25:49,481 --> 00:25:50,743
sorry.

582
00:25:50,815 --> 00:25:52,407
just admit it.
you were ready to burst.

583
00:25:52,484 --> 00:25:54,816
yeah, because l'm horny.
you...her.

584
00:25:54,886 --> 00:25:56,786
she has a name.

585
00:25:56,855 --> 00:25:59,255
- how do you feel?
- lt was fine.

586
00:25:59,324 --> 00:26:02,782
lt was acting
and l'm a damn fine actress.

587
00:26:02,861 --> 00:26:04,692
could you suck their dicks?

588
00:26:04,763 --> 00:26:06,697
yeah, and maybe even
let me fuck you?

589
00:26:06,765 --> 00:26:09,962
lf you suck his dick and maybe
even let him fuck you.

590
00:26:10,035 --> 00:26:11,297
never gonna happen.

591
00:26:11,369 --> 00:26:13,200
then l guess you
got your answer.

592
00:26:13,271 --> 00:26:15,671
see?
lt is about control.

593
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:17,708
see.
lt is about fear.

594
00:26:17,776 --> 00:26:19,368
l'll fuck either one
of you if he beats off

595
00:26:19,444 --> 00:26:21,105
so l get the visual.

596
00:26:21,179 --> 00:26:23,340
since you put it that way!

597
00:26:23,415 --> 00:26:25,315
you're serious?

598
00:26:25,383 --> 00:26:28,910
l don't know.
just show me your breasts again.

599
00:26:42,334 --> 00:26:44,029
you might as well
show me yours -

600
00:26:44,102 --> 00:26:45,729
if you want me to get
an education and all.

601
00:26:45,804 --> 00:26:47,362
sorry, l'm not
into three ways.

602
00:26:47,439 --> 00:26:48,770
ls this because you've
got funky nipples?

603
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:50,467
fuck you.

604
00:26:50,542 --> 00:26:52,134
what do you think?

605
00:26:53,511 --> 00:26:54,876
l want to suck one.

606
00:26:54,946 --> 00:26:56,846
- why?
- curious.

607
00:26:56,915 --> 00:26:58,780
that makes you
a good student.

608
00:27:10,395 --> 00:27:11,760
afraid our little
experiment failed.

609
00:27:11,830 --> 00:27:13,161
l feel nothing.

610
00:27:13,231 --> 00:27:14,858
they're just flesh.

611
00:27:14,933 --> 00:27:17,493
but you can't stop with your
little thinking cap off.

612
00:27:17,569 --> 00:27:19,833
dude, your approach
was all wrong.

613
00:27:44,896 --> 00:27:46,659
kiss him.

614
00:27:46,731 --> 00:27:48,426
do it.

615
00:27:53,238 --> 00:27:55,138
kris, l need to talk to you.

616
00:28:05,817 --> 00:28:07,045
how did it feel?

617
00:28:07,118 --> 00:28:09,814
my tongue....
ln your mouth.

618
00:28:09,888 --> 00:28:11,219
lt was an anomaly.

619
00:28:11,289 --> 00:28:12,688
too peculiar
to have existed?

620
00:28:12,757 --> 00:28:14,122
- exactly.
- but you did it.

621
00:28:14,192 --> 00:28:16,285
- heat of the moment.
- whatever.

622
00:28:16,361 --> 00:28:18,556
you're worse than
a fucking woman.

623
00:28:18,630 --> 00:28:20,188
no, just worse than
fucking a woman.

624
00:28:20,265 --> 00:28:21,926
whatever!

625
00:28:32,043 --> 00:28:33,704
you sure you're okay?

626
00:28:33,778 --> 00:28:35,575
do you feel strange?

627
00:28:35,647 --> 00:28:37,581
what do you mean?

628
00:28:37,649 --> 00:28:39,913
l'm all out of sorts.

629
00:28:39,984 --> 00:28:42,475
all tingly and shit.

630
00:28:42,554 --> 00:28:44,647
j.d.'s always had good drugs.

631
00:28:44,723 --> 00:28:47,783
yeah, l guess.

632
00:28:47,859 --> 00:28:50,760
okay.
see you then.

633
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:57,092
what happened to j.d.?

634
00:28:57,168 --> 00:28:58,692
he left.

635
00:28:58,770 --> 00:29:00,294
something wrong with heidi?

636
00:29:00,371 --> 00:29:03,807
thought she was bleeding.
turned out to be precum.

637
00:29:03,875 --> 00:29:06,309
are you guys
talking about me?

638
00:29:06,377 --> 00:29:08,971
yeah, we're laughing about
what a latent hetero you are.

639
00:29:09,047 --> 00:29:10,036
ha-ha-ha.

640
00:29:10,115 --> 00:29:11,139
where's j.d.?

641
00:29:11,216 --> 00:29:13,582
- he's gone.
- good riddance!

642
00:29:13,651 --> 00:29:15,778
oh, god, l think l'm
falling in love with him.

643
00:29:15,854 --> 00:29:17,082
fucker.

644
00:29:17,155 --> 00:29:21,057
by the way, that was real
smooth, that crotch-grab.

645
00:29:21,126 --> 00:29:22,650
l've had finer moments.

646
00:29:22,727 --> 00:29:25,218
anyway,
you'll get over it.

647
00:29:25,296 --> 00:29:27,093
l mean there's not
much there to love.

648
00:29:27,165 --> 00:29:28,393
women think he's a joke.

649
00:29:28,466 --> 00:29:29,694
they have coffee
and laugh at him.

650
00:29:29,768 --> 00:29:31,133
now you're just
being cruel.

651
00:29:31,202 --> 00:29:32,066
are you guys hungry?

652
00:29:32,137 --> 00:29:33,627
l need something to
eat before l pass out.

653
00:29:33,705 --> 00:29:34,865
l'll order chinese.

654
00:29:34,939 --> 00:29:36,600
order j.d. something
sweet and sour -

655
00:29:36,674 --> 00:29:40,667
with a fortune cookie validating
his pathetic existence!

656
00:29:40,745 --> 00:29:42,736
- hmm.
- what hmm?

657
00:29:42,814 --> 00:29:44,179
he really gets to you.

658
00:29:44,249 --> 00:29:46,046
don't put j.d. off on me.

659
00:29:46,117 --> 00:29:48,017
you're the one in love with
something you can't have.

660
00:29:48,086 --> 00:29:50,452
and l'm the only one
here with that problem?

661
00:30:32,530 --> 00:30:34,122
hello, bitches!
l'm home!

662
00:30:34,199 --> 00:30:35,826
asswipe.

663
00:30:36,968 --> 00:30:39,436
here...
be a man - have a beer.

664
00:30:40,738 --> 00:30:42,137
all right.

665
00:30:42,207 --> 00:30:44,505
so l've been thinking.

666
00:30:44,576 --> 00:30:46,976
and drinking.

667
00:30:47,045 --> 00:30:48,307
you know how we've
been talking about

668
00:30:48,379 --> 00:30:50,074
psycho men and women?

669
00:30:50,148 --> 00:30:52,207
l think we're
all fucked up.

670
00:30:52,283 --> 00:30:53,944
we should just
blow up the world!

671
00:30:54,018 --> 00:30:55,952
what's the number
of the fbl?

672
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:57,783
you know what?

673
00:30:57,856 --> 00:31:00,324
all three of you have been
fucking with me all night

674
00:31:00,391 --> 00:31:02,825
and l want to know why.

675
00:31:02,894 --> 00:31:05,886
l mean, it's a lot like
being in a relationship.

676
00:31:05,964 --> 00:31:08,023
do a certain thing.
be a certain way.

677
00:31:08,099 --> 00:31:09,396
for god's sake,
don't think!

678
00:31:09,467 --> 00:31:12,129
don't share your
fucking ideas.

679
00:31:13,605 --> 00:31:16,130
of course l don't think we
should blow up the world.

680
00:31:16,207 --> 00:31:20,610
but l mean why the fuck
are you girls so frustrating?

681
00:31:20,678 --> 00:31:21,906
quit referring to
me in the feminine.

682
00:31:21,980 --> 00:31:23,675
truth is l'm more
masculine than you are.

683
00:31:23,748 --> 00:31:25,238
how's the weather
in deluded land?

684
00:31:25,316 --> 00:31:27,250
wait, back up.

685
00:31:27,318 --> 00:31:29,718
why destroy
what we can fix?

686
00:31:29,787 --> 00:31:32,187
but that's just it.
we can't fix it.

687
00:31:32,257 --> 00:31:34,691
- fix what?
- society.

688
00:31:34,759 --> 00:31:35,987
bullshit!

689
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:37,721
what are you
really saying?

690
00:31:37,795 --> 00:31:39,160
can't fix yourself?

691
00:31:39,230 --> 00:31:40,822
such bullshit!

692
00:31:40,899 --> 00:31:42,560
control your sex drive--

693
00:31:42,634 --> 00:31:44,158
- j.d., you're--
- just let him talk.

694
00:31:44,235 --> 00:31:45,532
thank you, kris.

695
00:31:45,603 --> 00:31:47,161
well, l for one don't
want to hear it.

696
00:31:47,238 --> 00:31:49,706
he's gonna go
blah, blah, blah about all these

697
00:31:49,774 --> 00:31:51,207
blah, blah things.

698
00:31:51,276 --> 00:31:53,710
just destroy the world
when blah, blah, blah.

699
00:31:53,778 --> 00:31:55,177
don't mock me, heidi.

700
00:31:55,246 --> 00:31:56,713
could you leave
intelligent conversations

701
00:31:56,781 --> 00:31:59,341
to the adults
and go blow up the world?

702
00:31:59,417 --> 00:32:00,907
you're not just
talking about him.

703
00:32:00,985 --> 00:32:01,917
you're talking
about all of them.

704
00:32:01,986 --> 00:32:03,078
men. yeah.

705
00:32:03,154 --> 00:32:04,485
lt goes back to
that, doesn't it?

706
00:32:04,555 --> 00:32:06,352
men destroy everything.
think about it.

707
00:32:06,424 --> 00:32:08,119
why are you letting
him get to you?

708
00:32:08,192 --> 00:32:10,490
because l don't like
the way he thinks!

709
00:32:10,561 --> 00:32:13,291
l'm happy women
shut you down.

710
00:32:13,364 --> 00:32:15,298
because if they hadn't
we'd have seen your ugly

711
00:32:15,366 --> 00:32:18,335
mug on the evening news
a long-ass time ago.

712
00:32:18,403 --> 00:32:19,529
why don't you just
talk directly

713
00:32:19,604 --> 00:32:20,969
about what's really
bothering you?

714
00:32:21,039 --> 00:32:24,805
- kris, can l be frank?
- ls that your drag name?

715
00:32:24,876 --> 00:32:29,142
you're just like j.d. -
destructive.

716
00:32:29,213 --> 00:32:31,272
why are you being
so aggressive?

717
00:32:31,349 --> 00:32:33,544
he just came in and said
he wants to blow us all up.

718
00:32:33,618 --> 00:32:34,846
doesn't that frighten you?

719
00:32:34,919 --> 00:32:35,977
he's just playing
the same game.

720
00:32:36,054 --> 00:32:37,385
we're all playing it.

721
00:32:37,455 --> 00:32:40,219
heidi, you're getting
a little too fucked up.

722
00:32:40,291 --> 00:32:42,122
no more.
you're cut off.

723
00:32:42,193 --> 00:32:44,787
j.d., playing games.
ha!

724
00:32:44,862 --> 00:32:47,592
he can't even read
the instructions.

725
00:32:47,665 --> 00:32:49,360
l don't think anyone
could disagree with me

726
00:32:49,434 --> 00:32:51,800
because all l'm saying
is things in our lives

727
00:32:51,869 --> 00:32:54,895
are pretty fucking ugly
and for the exact same reason!

728
00:32:54,973 --> 00:32:56,838
and they don't have
to be, ls all.

729
00:32:56,908 --> 00:32:59,433
you want a world
where you alone are right.

730
00:32:59,510 --> 00:33:00,841
you know what?

731
00:33:00,912 --> 00:33:02,880
l don't want to live in
your world, by the way.

732
00:33:02,947 --> 00:33:04,380
you don't want to live
in a peaceful world?

733
00:33:04,449 --> 00:33:06,110
rafe, back me up on this.

734
00:33:06,184 --> 00:33:07,583
do you want to live
in a peaceful world?

735
00:33:07,652 --> 00:33:08,880
sure. whatever.

736
00:33:08,953 --> 00:33:11,387
your version of
peace is pretty fucking lame!

737
00:33:11,456 --> 00:33:12,923
can't we all
just get along?

738
00:33:12,991 --> 00:33:14,390
fine!

739
00:33:14,459 --> 00:33:16,324
get us there.

740
00:33:16,394 --> 00:33:18,328
but you fucking lesbians-

741
00:33:18,396 --> 00:33:20,057
we're not a species.

742
00:33:20,131 --> 00:33:22,190
truth is you're
men without dicks.

743
00:33:22,266 --> 00:33:24,291
you're really sad.
that's all l can say.

744
00:33:24,369 --> 00:33:26,269
you want to
know what's sad?

745
00:33:26,337 --> 00:33:29,101
ghosts with confused
sexual identities.

746
00:33:29,173 --> 00:33:30,868
you want to know
what's really sad?

747
00:33:30,942 --> 00:33:34,776
aimless wanderers who
fuck anything that moves.

748
00:33:34,846 --> 00:33:36,177
you're worse
than a faggot.

749
00:33:36,247 --> 00:33:38,306
you think what you do
is a public service.

750
00:33:38,383 --> 00:33:39,350
shut up.

751
00:33:39,417 --> 00:33:41,977
don't tell me to shut up.
l'll kick your fucking ass!

752
00:33:42,053 --> 00:33:43,350
believe that!

753
00:33:43,421 --> 00:33:45,889
their behavior is
exactly why l'm detoxing.

754
00:33:51,462 --> 00:33:52,952
l'm sick of
you bashing me.

755
00:33:53,031 --> 00:33:55,056
poor j.d.!
doesn't mind hitting people

756
00:33:55,133 --> 00:33:57,624
but challenge his intellect
and his 'feewings' get hurt.

757
00:33:57,702 --> 00:33:59,727
spend your time hating
men so you don't have

758
00:33:59,804 --> 00:34:02,068
to think about yourself.
good fucking strategy.

759
00:34:02,140 --> 00:34:03,437
you don't know
anything about me.

760
00:34:03,508 --> 00:34:04,941
l know everything about you.

761
00:34:05,009 --> 00:34:06,567
my sister's a dike, remember?

762
00:34:06,644 --> 00:34:07,975
at least one of you
came out right.

763
00:34:08,046 --> 00:34:10,071
and she tells me how
clannish dikes are.

764
00:34:10,148 --> 00:34:12,981
you have to have a fucking
password to get into parties.

765
00:34:13,051 --> 00:34:15,019
lf you're not in a
clique, you're screwed.

766
00:34:15,086 --> 00:34:16,348
l'm surprised they
let you in with an

767
00:34:16,421 --> 00:34:18,582
anorexic little body like that.

768
00:34:18,656 --> 00:34:20,453
be honest with yourself.

769
00:34:20,525 --> 00:34:22,720
lf kate hadn't dumped
you, there's no way

770
00:34:22,794 --> 00:34:25,524
in hell you'd be hanging
here with us tonight.

771
00:34:25,596 --> 00:34:28,156
that's why no one's
seen you in months.

772
00:34:28,232 --> 00:34:31,065
you've been holed
up with her.

773
00:34:31,135 --> 00:34:33,160
now that it's over
you're reconnecting

774
00:34:33,237 --> 00:34:35,000
with your friends.

775
00:34:35,073 --> 00:34:39,737
but the truth is...
you're just using us.

776
00:34:39,811 --> 00:34:41,369
she didn't dump me.

777
00:34:41,446 --> 00:34:43,414
whatever you want
to tell yourself.

778
00:34:46,250 --> 00:34:48,616
we're very similar,
you and me.

779
00:34:48,686 --> 00:34:51,780
you're mad at her
and you're taking it out on me

780
00:34:51,856 --> 00:34:54,120
because you think
that l won't fight back.

781
00:34:54,192 --> 00:34:56,683
don't you ever put me in
the same category as you.

782
00:34:56,761 --> 00:34:59,195
l'm just trying to talk.

783
00:34:59,263 --> 00:35:01,060
why don't you see a
doctor about removing

784
00:35:01,132 --> 00:35:03,157
that infected bug
from your ass.

785
00:35:03,234 --> 00:35:04,394
you're the ass here.

786
00:35:04,469 --> 00:35:06,562
mule-like pathetic
piece of shit.

787
00:35:06,637 --> 00:35:08,434
how many daddy complexes
have you fucked?

788
00:35:08,506 --> 00:35:10,303
- what?
- daddy complexes.

789
00:35:10,374 --> 00:35:12,205
men that remind
you of your father.

790
00:35:12,276 --> 00:35:14,039
how many have you fucked?

791
00:35:14,112 --> 00:35:16,307
- l'll answer if you do.
- whatever.

792
00:35:16,380 --> 00:35:17,938
'cause there's no way
to be your age

793
00:35:18,015 --> 00:35:19,312
and not sleep with a guy.

794
00:35:19,383 --> 00:35:21,112
or at least think about it.
right, j.d.?

795
00:35:21,185 --> 00:35:23,653
full...of...shit.

796
00:35:23,721 --> 00:35:26,622
and you're...a...liar.

797
00:35:26,691 --> 00:35:28,818
l can spot a liar
a thousand feet away.

798
00:35:28,893 --> 00:35:30,520
you can spot
a liar in anyone.

799
00:35:30,595 --> 00:35:32,495
what the fuck are you
guys talking about?

800
00:35:32,563 --> 00:35:34,497
your straight friend can
get it up for women,

801
00:35:34,565 --> 00:35:37,500
but he can't keep it together
and give her what she needs.

802
00:35:37,568 --> 00:35:39,263
so while he orgasms
and technically wallows

803
00:35:39,337 --> 00:35:42,329
in the afterglow, he's an
emotionally incapacitated

804
00:35:42,406 --> 00:35:44,772
fag, and that makes him
really fucking angry!

805
00:35:44,842 --> 00:35:47,003
and you're a cunt
that's been overused!

806
00:35:47,078 --> 00:35:48,477
no one here
hates either you.

807
00:35:48,546 --> 00:35:50,673
l wish you would both
return the favor.

808
00:35:57,021 --> 00:35:59,285
l know all your types.

809
00:35:59,357 --> 00:36:02,815
eager to get what you want
and fuck the consequences.

810
00:36:02,894 --> 00:36:05,920
no one has to hurt because
that's the way sex is.

811
00:36:05,997 --> 00:36:11,492
lt's deep and dark and ugly
and it's urgent and we need it!

812
00:36:11,569 --> 00:36:13,764
but what about the
people who fucking feel

813
00:36:13,838 --> 00:36:15,806
when they are being fucked?

814
00:36:18,309 --> 00:36:20,300
did you get alds?

815
00:36:21,879 --> 00:36:23,540
what?

816
00:36:24,615 --> 00:36:27,743
l mean it makes sense.
lsn't that what all this about?

817
00:36:27,818 --> 00:36:29,513
why would you say
something like that?

818
00:36:29,587 --> 00:36:33,023
gays like you kill yourselves
because of self-hatred.

819
00:36:33,090 --> 00:36:36,924
you drink, do drugs,
and then fuck and die -

820
00:36:36,994 --> 00:36:38,791
like insects, or salmon.

821
00:36:38,863 --> 00:36:41,195
lesbians are the
most disease-free-

822
00:36:41,265 --> 00:36:44,792
l've had dear friends die
of alds, and that was

823
00:36:44,869 --> 00:36:48,327
akin to verbal rape,
you ignorant fucking pig!

824
00:36:48,406 --> 00:36:49,805
truth hurts.

825
00:36:49,874 --> 00:36:51,273
fuck you!

826
00:36:51,342 --> 00:36:53,105
die of alds, already.

827
00:36:53,177 --> 00:36:55,077
you sick asshole - what kind of
hell do you live in?

828
00:36:55,146 --> 00:36:57,114
sorry, buddy,
god's on my side.

829
00:36:57,181 --> 00:36:59,775
when l fuck you l'm gonna
whisper a secret in your ear.

830
00:36:59,850 --> 00:37:01,875
keep dreaming, faggot,
because it's never gonna happen!

831
00:37:01,953 --> 00:37:03,887
you're making a great
big ass of yourself, j.d.

832
00:37:03,955 --> 00:37:05,422
and frankly it's embarrassing.

833
00:37:05,489 --> 00:37:07,514
l've had enough of this
fucking bullshit evening.

834
00:37:07,592 --> 00:37:09,355
heidi, don't leave like this!

835
00:37:09,427 --> 00:37:11,224
bu-bye.

836
00:37:16,601 --> 00:37:18,432
wait.

837
00:37:24,475 --> 00:37:27,774
l'm not going anywhere because
of that fucking piece of shit.

838
00:37:33,451 --> 00:37:35,112
hello.

839
00:37:37,688 --> 00:37:40,156
go get a beer.
you're shaking.

840
00:37:42,793 --> 00:37:47,025
l'm not drunk...
l'm pissed.

841
00:37:47,098 --> 00:37:49,828
and you all are
fucking being mean.

842
00:37:55,773 --> 00:38:02,542
rafe, are you sure l don't
look like bjork like this?

843
00:38:09,420 --> 00:38:11,854
no, seriously.

844
00:38:13,557 --> 00:38:15,081
sorry.

845
00:38:16,961 --> 00:38:23,093
come on...
don't fucking shut me out.

846
00:38:25,469 --> 00:38:28,131
l'm sorry!

847
00:38:28,205 --> 00:38:31,038
l know l just overreacted.

848
00:38:31,108 --> 00:38:34,009
but that thing
has got to be punished.

849
00:38:34,078 --> 00:38:35,909
don't go down to his level.

850
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:37,675
everything's cool.

851
00:38:37,748 --> 00:38:41,684
j.d. -
come with me please.

852
00:38:43,988 --> 00:38:46,582
l'm not going to
ask you twice.

853
00:39:01,205 --> 00:39:03,469
what is this -
another party game?

854
00:39:03,541 --> 00:39:05,532
lt's a test.

855
00:39:06,610 --> 00:39:08,441
of what?

856
00:39:09,347 --> 00:39:12,942
do it or else you
automatically fail.

857
00:39:13,584 --> 00:39:15,552
put your hand out.

858
00:39:17,021 --> 00:39:18,488
ls it hot?

859
00:39:18,556 --> 00:39:20,581
duh.

860
00:39:59,764 --> 00:40:01,789
gullible.

861
00:40:08,706 --> 00:40:10,833
kinky bitch.

862
00:40:13,978 --> 00:40:15,775
that was quick.

863
00:40:15,846 --> 00:40:17,939
heidi, come here.

864
00:40:32,863 --> 00:40:34,831
what's going on?

865
00:40:37,034 --> 00:40:39,969
you're about to be
the sacrificial whore.

866
00:40:41,305 --> 00:40:43,398
dude, rafe is so
not fucking me.

867
00:40:43,474 --> 00:40:45,567
who said anything
about rafe?

868
00:40:47,445 --> 00:40:49,709
ow!
okay, easy!

869
00:40:55,653 --> 00:40:58,019
you're not gettin' near me
with that thing.

870
00:41:02,726 --> 00:41:05,092
okay, this so
isn't funny.

871
00:41:05,162 --> 00:41:08,654
doesn't have to be funny.
just has to be fun.

872
00:41:23,214 --> 00:41:25,273
now l get
what a grower is.

873
00:41:25,349 --> 00:41:29,183
floppin' around like that -
helpless...scared.

874
00:41:29,253 --> 00:41:31,312
fucking crazy-ass women!

875
00:41:31,388 --> 00:41:33,151
fucking crazy-ass women what?

876
00:41:33,224 --> 00:41:35,988
we're so right
and he's afraid of it.

877
00:41:36,060 --> 00:41:37,823
strangely intrigued,
but wondering -

878
00:41:37,895 --> 00:41:38,953
what the fuck are you doing?

879
00:41:39,029 --> 00:41:40,326
shut it, rafe,
or you're next.

880
00:41:40,397 --> 00:41:41,887
get them off of me!

881
00:41:41,966 --> 00:41:43,558
lt's been real.
no room for me here.

882
00:41:43,634 --> 00:41:45,295
see ya!

883
00:41:51,075 --> 00:41:52,235
do you have any condoms?

884
00:41:52,309 --> 00:41:53,833
l don't want to get
shit under my nails.

885
00:41:53,911 --> 00:41:55,435
oh, l hate that.

886
00:41:59,817 --> 00:42:03,514
fyl, she's about to ram
a finger in your asshole.

887
00:42:03,587 --> 00:42:05,578
don't do this if you
know what's good for you.

888
00:42:05,656 --> 00:42:07,988
we're doing this
for your own good.

889
00:42:08,058 --> 00:42:10,526
he'll be squealing like
piggie from ''deliverance.''

890
00:42:10,594 --> 00:42:12,118
here's the good news.

891
00:42:12,196 --> 00:42:14,687
l'm gonna perform fellatio.

892
00:42:14,765 --> 00:42:16,824
you're gonna have
to lift your legs a little.

893
00:42:16,901 --> 00:42:20,359
because when l get you hard,
heidi's gonna shove it in

894
00:42:20,437 --> 00:42:22,701
and you're gonna
cum in 15 seconds.

895
00:42:22,773 --> 00:42:24,206
give piggie ten.

896
00:42:24,275 --> 00:42:26,243
go slow at first.

897
00:42:27,878 --> 00:42:29,470
ready?

898
00:42:29,547 --> 00:42:31,538
no.

899
00:42:31,615 --> 00:42:32,639
ready?

900
00:42:32,716 --> 00:42:35,412
wee! wee! wee!

901
00:42:35,486 --> 00:42:39,183
l'm so excited to be part of
your first anal insertion.

902
00:42:39,256 --> 00:42:41,190
let me give you some
tips real quick.

903
00:42:41,258 --> 00:42:43,419
okay, don't clench your
butt crack because as soon

904
00:42:43,494 --> 00:42:45,359
as she shoves
her fingers in...

905
00:42:45,429 --> 00:42:46,862
mmmmmmmm...

906
00:42:46,931 --> 00:42:48,899
see it doesn't feel so good,

907
00:42:48,966 --> 00:42:50,490
but if you're nice and loose...

908
00:42:50,568 --> 00:42:52,160
ah...

909
00:42:52,236 --> 00:42:53,897
pet the baby...

910
00:42:53,971 --> 00:42:55,666
and it's heidi's fingers.

911
00:42:55,739 --> 00:42:57,832
she's really good with them
because she's a lesbian.

912
00:42:57,908 --> 00:43:01,309
hmm hmm.
fudge packin' is good!

913
00:43:01,378 --> 00:43:02,675
[door buzzes]

914
00:43:02,746 --> 00:43:04,475
l'm ravenous.

915
00:43:10,921 --> 00:43:13,412
- do you have enough cash?
- l'll charge it.

916
00:43:13,490 --> 00:43:14,821
l'll buzz him in.

917
00:43:14,892 --> 00:43:17,986
ha, ha.
very funny, bitches.

918
00:43:19,530 --> 00:43:20,929
you okay now?

919
00:43:20,998 --> 00:43:23,159
that was cathartic.

920
00:43:23,233 --> 00:43:24,791
he just really
pissed me off.

921
00:43:24,868 --> 00:43:26,768
as does kate, it seems.

922
00:43:26,837 --> 00:43:28,361
you don't know
anything about us.

923
00:43:28,973 --> 00:43:30,440
where are you going?

924
00:43:30,507 --> 00:43:32,441
ls kate the reason you've been
out of touch?

925
00:43:32,509 --> 00:43:34,443
you didn't call-

926
00:43:34,511 --> 00:43:36,411
you wouldn't understand.

927
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:39,108
no, l've never been
in a relationship.

928
00:43:40,951 --> 00:43:44,409
the point is you're here now
and l missed you.

929
00:43:44,488 --> 00:43:46,422
l wish l understood
your motives.

930
00:43:46,490 --> 00:43:48,424
l am exactly
what you see.

931
00:43:48,492 --> 00:43:51,188
let's freak out
this delivery guy.

932
00:43:52,496 --> 00:43:54,430
- hi!
- hello.

933
00:43:54,498 --> 00:43:56,489
uh, hi.

934
00:43:56,567 --> 00:43:59,297
you are cute.

935
00:43:59,370 --> 00:44:02,203
you guys are fucking dead
when l get out of here.

936
00:44:02,272 --> 00:44:03,899
you better
leave me locked up.

937
00:44:03,974 --> 00:44:05,441
did l come at a bad time?

938
00:44:05,509 --> 00:44:09,468
any time you come
is never a bad time.

939
00:44:13,884 --> 00:44:15,408
thank you.

940
00:44:16,887 --> 00:44:18,616
you know this was
my last run--

941
00:44:18,689 --> 00:44:21,283
we've got more than
we can handle tonight.

942
00:44:24,161 --> 00:44:25,685
excuse me.

943
00:44:31,201 --> 00:44:32,327
bye-bye.

944
00:44:32,403 --> 00:44:34,200
nighty night.

945
00:44:41,645 --> 00:44:44,409
cute, but dumb.
he didn't take my card.

946
00:44:46,750 --> 00:44:49,150
you haven't touched
your sum-yungai.

947
00:44:49,219 --> 00:44:51,380
well if anybody had
asked before l was so

948
00:44:51,455 --> 00:44:55,016
rudely incapacitated,
l'm a vegetarian now.

949
00:44:55,092 --> 00:44:57,151
eat your white rice
and stop bitching already.

950
00:44:57,227 --> 00:44:58,353
suck my dick.

951
00:44:58,429 --> 00:44:59,987
- whip it out.
- whip it out.

952
00:45:00,064 --> 00:45:01,224
l feel sorry for
straight men.

953
00:45:01,298 --> 00:45:02,697
they can't be clever -
so they mimic.

954
00:45:02,766 --> 00:45:05,132
lt's a passive-aggressive way
of doing what they're told.

955
00:45:05,202 --> 00:45:06,100
anyway--

956
00:45:06,170 --> 00:45:08,900
no one's making you stay.
l'll pay for your cab.

957
00:45:08,972 --> 00:45:10,633
l don't need your money.

958
00:45:10,708 --> 00:45:12,175
he just thought it would
be different, is all.

959
00:45:12,242 --> 00:45:13,709
what did you think
would be different?

960
00:45:13,777 --> 00:45:15,074
he thought the night
would wind down

961
00:45:15,145 --> 00:45:17,511
and rafe would run
off and chase some dick.

962
00:45:17,581 --> 00:45:19,708
no dick is gonna want me
after eating all this.

963
00:45:19,783 --> 00:45:21,808
yeah, those two shrimp
and three peas

964
00:45:21,885 --> 00:45:23,477
are really holding you back.

965
00:45:23,554 --> 00:45:25,681
homosexual men have
so much in common

966
00:45:25,756 --> 00:45:27,883
with 12-year-old girls,
it's scary.

967
00:45:27,958 --> 00:45:30,893
l for one have heard enough
verbal diarrhea for one night.

968
00:45:30,961 --> 00:45:32,223
help me clean this up.

969
00:45:32,296 --> 00:45:34,594
- no, l'm too tired.
- get up, you bitch!

970
00:45:36,500 --> 00:45:38,593
kris, where are your cds?

971
00:45:38,669 --> 00:45:41,137
they're in that little
hexagonal thingy over there.

972
00:45:41,205 --> 00:45:42,900
they're in order
alphabetically.

973
00:45:42,973 --> 00:45:44,941
no one here's surprised.

974
00:45:45,008 --> 00:45:47,272
you're pretty mouthy for a
person with an index finger

975
00:45:47,344 --> 00:45:50,006
this close to his fear hole.

976
00:46:00,991 --> 00:46:02,925
let's dance.

977
00:46:02,993 --> 00:46:04,722
like we did in junior high.

978
00:46:04,795 --> 00:46:06,626
when the girl would lay her
head on the guy's shoulder

979
00:46:06,697 --> 00:46:08,722
and was just happy
to be close to him.

980
00:46:08,799 --> 00:46:11,097
l want that now.

981
00:46:11,168 --> 00:46:13,227
lie.

982
00:46:13,303 --> 00:46:14,531
a head lies, right?

983
00:46:14,605 --> 00:46:16,573
l guess if you're
a straight guy.

984
00:46:32,623 --> 00:46:34,454
penny for your thoughts.

985
00:46:34,525 --> 00:46:36,152
save your money.

986
00:46:36,226 --> 00:46:38,057
you look lost in one of
those ideas so powerful

987
00:46:38,128 --> 00:46:40,028
it might last for months.

988
00:46:40,097 --> 00:46:41,928
some ideas
last for years.

989
00:46:41,999 --> 00:46:44,467
lifetimes, even.

990
00:46:45,135 --> 00:46:46,727
come dance with me.

991
00:46:46,804 --> 00:46:48,396
l don't want to dance.

992
00:46:48,472 --> 00:46:51,669
come on, it'll burn calories.

993
00:46:51,742 --> 00:46:54,006
l need to rest.

994
00:46:54,077 --> 00:46:56,272
then l'll lie with you.

995
00:47:01,185 --> 00:47:03,278
you smell like vanilla.

996
00:47:08,392 --> 00:47:10,189
sorry for earlier.

997
00:47:10,260 --> 00:47:11,693
be quiet.

998
00:47:11,762 --> 00:47:14,196
why?
you must have something to say.

999
00:47:14,264 --> 00:47:16,391
actually, a theory
just came to me.

1000
00:47:16,466 --> 00:47:18,491
l think you might like it.

1001
00:47:18,569 --> 00:47:20,264
jesus, can't we
take a break?

1002
00:47:20,337 --> 00:47:22,635
my theory is that
''straight men''

1003
00:47:22,706 --> 00:47:25,732
have sex with other men,
they're just really clever

1004
00:47:25,809 --> 00:47:27,970
about calling it male bonding.

1005
00:47:28,045 --> 00:47:29,637
this has to do
with me how?.

1006
00:47:29,713 --> 00:47:31,408
you watch football, right?

1007
00:47:31,481 --> 00:47:33,676
basketball, baseball,
fishing and soccer.

1008
00:47:33,750 --> 00:47:34,944
and?

1009
00:47:35,018 --> 00:47:38,317
lt's so annoying to walk into a
bar with a football game on.

1010
00:47:38,388 --> 00:47:41,255
men feel compelled
to scream out loud.

1011
00:47:41,325 --> 00:47:43,850
do their victory
dances, bump stomachs,

1012
00:47:43,927 --> 00:47:45,952
high-five,
grab each other's backs.

1013
00:47:46,029 --> 00:47:49,487
all because their ''tight end''
just scored a point.

1014
00:47:49,566 --> 00:47:52,034
dude, they're
having a good time.

1015
00:47:52,102 --> 00:47:56,334
j.d...they're having
emotional orgasms.

1016
00:47:56,406 --> 00:47:58,203
fuck!

1017
00:47:58,275 --> 00:48:01,244
you've scored all the points
you're gonna score with me.

1018
00:48:02,679 --> 00:48:05,705
the only difference between
real sex and sports sex

1019
00:48:05,782 --> 00:48:09,047
is that there aren't
any penises involved.

1020
00:48:09,119 --> 00:48:12,282
men just beat off later to a
general mood of jubilation,

1021
00:48:12,356 --> 00:48:15,325
pretending they found the
cheerleaders really fuckable.

1022
00:48:17,294 --> 00:48:19,387
you are so full of shit.

1023
00:48:19,463 --> 00:48:21,431
you didn't know this?

1024
00:48:21,498 --> 00:48:22,760
l guess women didn't
say anything

1025
00:48:22,833 --> 00:48:25,267
because they'd rather you
have emotional orgasms.

1026
00:48:25,335 --> 00:48:28,031
less disease
and jealousy that way.

1027
00:48:28,105 --> 00:48:31,199
what's the punch line?
just get it over with.

1028
00:48:31,275 --> 00:48:35,439
even if a guy's technically
never had sex with another man,

1029
00:48:35,512 --> 00:48:38,504
he's had emotional
sex with his buddy.

1030
00:48:38,582 --> 00:48:42,575
and in a woman's eyes that's
pretty close to the same thing.

1031
00:48:42,653 --> 00:48:44,280
do you get it?

1032
00:48:46,156 --> 00:48:47,817
you don't know me at all.

1033
00:48:47,891 --> 00:48:50,860
you're wrong.
my brother's straight.

1034
00:48:52,596 --> 00:48:55,565
well, at least one of
you came out right.

1035
00:48:58,568 --> 00:49:01,935
you know, you might think
you're a tough know-it-all,

1036
00:49:02,005 --> 00:49:05,998
but underneath
there's someone sad inside.

1037
00:49:06,076 --> 00:49:08,874
you haven't had much love
in your life, have you?

1038
00:49:08,946 --> 00:49:11,346
who the fuck are you
to judge me?

1039
00:49:11,415 --> 00:49:13,178
no one.

1040
00:49:13,250 --> 00:49:16,777
l'm mister stupid, remember?

1041
00:49:16,853 --> 00:49:18,844
that so wasn't nice.

1042
00:49:18,922 --> 00:49:21,220
and what you said was?

1043
00:49:33,337 --> 00:49:35,328
did anyone ever tell
you how cute you are

1044
00:49:35,405 --> 00:49:38,033
even when you're mad?

1045
00:49:39,810 --> 00:49:42,176
you're so high and horny.

1046
00:49:42,245 --> 00:49:44,236
and that suggestive
way you have

1047
00:49:44,314 --> 00:49:46,612
even when shutting them down.

1048
00:49:47,684 --> 00:49:49,709
you're very beautiful.

1049
00:49:49,786 --> 00:49:52,778
and l don't want
you to change.

1050
00:49:52,856 --> 00:49:55,654
but you will.

1051
00:49:56,393 --> 00:50:00,159
lt's happening already.

1052
00:50:00,230 --> 00:50:03,131
the bitterness is settling.

1053
00:50:04,968 --> 00:50:06,799
you might want to do
something about that

1054
00:50:06,870 --> 00:50:08,895
before it turns
into cancer.

1055
00:50:08,972 --> 00:50:11,600
what about you?

1056
00:50:11,675 --> 00:50:15,577
you're so
adorable and sexy...

1057
00:50:15,645 --> 00:50:17,545
talking about your
most personal things

1058
00:50:17,614 --> 00:50:20,481
when no one seems
to be listening.

1059
00:50:20,550 --> 00:50:23,451
but we're listening.

1060
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:26,614
we always listen to you.

1061
00:50:26,690 --> 00:50:31,354
but we're hurting 'cause we
know what's in store for you.

1062
00:50:31,428 --> 00:50:34,226
you won't escape.

1063
00:50:34,297 --> 00:50:37,789
you'll become just what
everyone expects you to become.

1064
00:50:41,972 --> 00:50:43,439
why are you so fucking--

1065
00:50:43,507 --> 00:50:46,999
l'm curious, j.d.
how much have you lost?

1066
00:50:47,077 --> 00:50:49,341
your innocence?

1067
00:50:49,413 --> 00:50:52,382
your purity?
your self-respect?

1068
00:50:54,718 --> 00:50:58,245
things are leaving and
they're never coming back.

1069
00:50:59,956 --> 00:51:03,517
you don't hate me.
you hate her.

1070
00:51:03,593 --> 00:51:06,118
stop doing this.

1071
00:51:06,196 --> 00:51:08,756
l don't hate anyone, j.d.

1072
00:51:09,299 --> 00:51:13,998
seriously...
tell me.

1073
00:51:14,071 --> 00:51:15,868
lt's okay.

1074
00:51:15,939 --> 00:51:17,600
just stop it!

1075
00:51:17,674 --> 00:51:19,005
what now?

1076
00:51:19,076 --> 00:51:21,067
j.d.'s slept with a guy.

1077
00:51:21,144 --> 00:51:23,578
for real.

1078
00:51:24,815 --> 00:51:26,942
and so have l.

1079
00:51:27,017 --> 00:51:28,917
ha, ha.

1080
00:51:30,320 --> 00:51:33,050
you're fucking
kidding me, right?

1081
00:51:33,123 --> 00:51:34,988
l had nothing
to do with it.

1082
00:51:35,058 --> 00:51:37,788
you're telling me all night
everyone's been fucking lying?

1083
00:51:37,861 --> 00:51:40,329
- l've never lied to you.
- well, they did.

1084
00:51:40,397 --> 00:51:43,798
technically we didn't because
you never asked any questions.

1085
00:51:43,867 --> 00:51:46,199
you said you were straight.
and you said you were gay.

1086
00:51:46,269 --> 00:51:48,100
okay, one white lie.

1087
00:51:48,171 --> 00:51:50,503
l did say l never
slept with a man,

1088
00:51:50,574 --> 00:51:52,769
but technically we
didn't sleep together.

1089
00:51:52,843 --> 00:51:54,868
he fucked me and then
l kicked his fat ass

1090
00:51:54,945 --> 00:51:56,071
out on the street.

1091
00:51:56,146 --> 00:51:57,841
oh, you fucking bitch.

1092
00:51:57,914 --> 00:52:01,315
you slept with a guy?
how many?

1093
00:52:01,384 --> 00:52:03,784
a couple.

1094
00:52:03,854 --> 00:52:05,685
a couple?
what the fuck does that mean?

1095
00:52:05,755 --> 00:52:07,518
two.

1096
00:52:07,591 --> 00:52:09,354
two fucking guys.

1097
00:52:09,426 --> 00:52:10,415
l'm still confused, j.d.

1098
00:52:10,494 --> 00:52:11,756
did you fuck a fucking couple

1099
00:52:11,828 --> 00:52:13,921
or did you fuck two
guys separately?

1100
00:52:13,997 --> 00:52:16,295
- when did it happen?
- fuck you all!

1101
00:52:16,366 --> 00:52:17,628
you're among friends.

1102
00:52:17,701 --> 00:52:19,032
who'll only use this
shit against me.

1103
00:52:19,102 --> 00:52:20,262
then don't tell us, j.d.

1104
00:52:20,337 --> 00:52:22,134
stop working both
fucking angles.

1105
00:52:22,205 --> 00:52:24,469
he's been dying to tell
everybody, right j.d.?

1106
00:52:24,541 --> 00:52:28,204
think about it - you get to tell
your deepest, darkest secret.

1107
00:52:28,278 --> 00:52:29,973
lt's more common than
you think so quit

1108
00:52:30,046 --> 00:52:33,106
being all histrionic
and just tell us.

1109
00:52:33,183 --> 00:52:36,243
you know what-
fine...

1110
00:52:36,319 --> 00:52:39,584
l'm gonna be the first one that
has the balls to be honest.

1111
00:52:41,725 --> 00:52:46,253
l fucked my cousin, okay?

1112
00:52:46,329 --> 00:52:48,923
we were playing some
game and we went

1113
00:52:48,999 --> 00:52:53,561
under the covers...
and it happened.

1114
00:52:53,637 --> 00:52:55,730
define ''it.''

1115
00:52:55,805 --> 00:52:58,433
friction and goo.

1116
00:52:58,508 --> 00:53:00,499
do you want to make
a re-creation of it?

1117
00:53:00,577 --> 00:53:02,568
maybe.

1118
00:53:02,646 --> 00:53:05,547
so tell me -
was that your first orgasm?

1119
00:53:05,615 --> 00:53:07,082
maybe.

1120
00:53:07,150 --> 00:53:09,948
ever?
before masturbation?

1121
00:53:10,020 --> 00:53:11,612
yeah, fine, all right!

1122
00:53:11,688 --> 00:53:14,350
my first orgasm
was with a guy.

1123
00:53:14,424 --> 00:53:15,721
happy?

1124
00:53:15,792 --> 00:53:17,089
and incest to boot!

1125
00:53:17,160 --> 00:53:18,684
you said there were two.

1126
00:53:18,762 --> 00:53:20,627
who was the other?

1127
00:53:22,132 --> 00:53:24,692
my coach.

1128
00:53:24,768 --> 00:53:26,759
all we're missing now
is j.d. in prison

1129
00:53:26,836 --> 00:53:29,532
being gang fucked
by a bunch of skinheads.

1130
00:53:29,606 --> 00:53:31,233
give it a
couple of years.

1131
00:53:31,308 --> 00:53:33,799
sorry, couldn't resist.

1132
00:53:33,877 --> 00:53:36,368
so what happened with coach?

1133
00:53:36,446 --> 00:53:39,142
seriously, l'm curious
how things like that happen.

1134
00:53:41,318 --> 00:53:42,910
l wrestled, okay.

1135
00:53:42,986 --> 00:53:46,922
and one match
l twisted my ankle.

1136
00:53:46,990 --> 00:53:50,426
and...you know,

1137
00:53:50,493 --> 00:53:54,589
l was in his office and l was
alone and l was in pain.

1138
00:53:54,664 --> 00:53:59,931
and he came in to take
care of my ankle and...

1139
00:54:00,003 --> 00:54:02,301
l don't know man,
like wrestling was my one

1140
00:54:02,372 --> 00:54:05,102
escape from everything that
was going bad in my life.

1141
00:54:05,175 --> 00:54:06,608
my family-

1142
00:54:06,676 --> 00:54:08,166
my parents were
getting divorced

1143
00:54:08,245 --> 00:54:11,146
and neither of them
wanted me around, so...

1144
00:54:11,214 --> 00:54:16,311
you know, it was somebody
who was actually...

1145
00:54:16,386 --> 00:54:18,411
loving me.

1146
00:54:21,258 --> 00:54:25,319
and he rubbed
something on my ankle...

1147
00:54:25,395 --> 00:54:29,491
and then blew.

1148
00:54:32,102 --> 00:54:35,594
just 'cause you sucked a dick
doesn't make you a faggot.

1149
00:54:35,672 --> 00:54:37,663
great, now you've
sucked a dick!

1150
00:54:37,741 --> 00:54:39,470
and l'm worse
than a woman.

1151
00:54:39,542 --> 00:54:41,305
perfect.
fucking perfect!

1152
00:54:41,378 --> 00:54:42,572
this isn't about you.

1153
00:54:42,646 --> 00:54:44,273
so everyone keeps
reminding me.

1154
00:54:44,347 --> 00:54:45,837
what happened next?

1155
00:54:45,915 --> 00:54:48,713
did you try to hide it
from yourself or everyone else?

1156
00:54:48,785 --> 00:54:51,276
ls there a difference?

1157
00:54:55,392 --> 00:54:58,293
l haven't thought of
this stuff until now.

1158
00:55:00,930 --> 00:55:03,194
l liked it, okay?

1159
00:55:03,266 --> 00:55:05,530
but it's not what l do.

1160
00:55:05,602 --> 00:55:07,832
lnstead you fuck women
and try to relive it?

1161
00:55:07,904 --> 00:55:09,769
there's no need to
be jealous, rafe.

1162
00:55:09,839 --> 00:55:11,807
- l'm not jealous.
- you sure?

1163
00:55:11,875 --> 00:55:15,106
yeah, l am jealous.

1164
00:55:15,178 --> 00:55:17,237
no one ever
did that to me.

1165
00:55:17,314 --> 00:55:18,781
and yet someone
you're attracted to

1166
00:55:18,848 --> 00:55:21,976
has fucked his own cousin
and wouldn't consider you?

1167
00:55:22,052 --> 00:55:24,384
shit like that never
happened to me -

1168
00:55:24,454 --> 00:55:26,888
and l wanted it.

1169
00:55:26,956 --> 00:55:28,184
you're complicated.

1170
00:55:28,258 --> 00:55:30,590
complicated people
are harder to seduce.

1171
00:55:30,660 --> 00:55:32,787
l'm not simple.

1172
00:55:35,532 --> 00:55:37,397
wait, is somebody
here in love with me?

1173
00:55:37,467 --> 00:55:39,094
rafe is in love
with you, j.d.

1174
00:55:39,169 --> 00:55:41,933
- fuck you, heidi.
- you're attacking me?

1175
00:55:42,005 --> 00:55:44,769
because l'm saying what
you're too afraid to say?

1176
00:55:44,841 --> 00:55:46,741
you feel betrayed because
the guy you're in love with

1177
00:55:46,810 --> 00:55:48,937
fucked everyone but you.
don't confuse this.

1178
00:55:49,012 --> 00:55:50,980
you know everything
about everybody.

1179
00:55:51,047 --> 00:55:53,538
fuck, you're the most scared
and isolated person l've met.

1180
00:55:53,616 --> 00:55:55,607
maybe this will help
you overcome all those

1181
00:55:55,685 --> 00:55:57,550
dark and sweaty
and pointless encounters

1182
00:55:57,620 --> 00:55:59,850
trying to find what
you'll never have.

1183
00:55:59,923 --> 00:56:02,323
you will never have
what j.d. had -

1184
00:56:02,392 --> 00:56:05,293
and quite frankly probably
never wanted that much.

1185
00:56:05,362 --> 00:56:07,159
what the fuck
are you talking about?

1186
00:56:07,230 --> 00:56:10,199
the irony is that gay
sex came easy for j.d.,

1187
00:56:10,266 --> 00:56:12,291
while you, on the other hand,
had to wait until you

1188
00:56:12,369 --> 00:56:15,497
could safely explore it
because it terrified you -

1189
00:56:15,572 --> 00:56:17,506
being called a fag.

1190
00:56:17,574 --> 00:56:20,509
you should know that
it's the guys like j.d.

1191
00:56:20,577 --> 00:56:22,636
that were having all the
gay sex in high school

1192
00:56:22,712 --> 00:56:25,738
but they were the first ones
to turn and call you a faggot.

1193
00:56:25,815 --> 00:56:28,147
lt's called displacement.

1194
00:56:28,218 --> 00:56:30,186
why do you think j.d. hit you?

1195
00:56:30,253 --> 00:56:31,618
you touched him.

1196
00:56:31,688 --> 00:56:35,852
l mean you really touched him.

1197
00:56:35,925 --> 00:56:37,654
maybe you're right.

1198
00:56:37,727 --> 00:56:39,661
l waited so long
because l was scared.

1199
00:56:39,729 --> 00:56:41,822
but l'm not
scared anymore.

1200
00:56:41,898 --> 00:56:43,525
all those sweaty
and pointless encounters?

1201
00:56:43,600 --> 00:56:44,828
lt's called sex.

1202
00:56:44,901 --> 00:56:46,596
you should look into it.
and you should take some

1203
00:56:46,669 --> 00:56:48,159
notes from me because
l can get sex

1204
00:56:48,238 --> 00:56:49,762
without complication and guilt.

1205
00:56:49,839 --> 00:56:51,500
oh, alds isn't a
complication anymore?

1206
00:56:51,574 --> 00:56:53,439
l'm real sorry
you lost your friends.

1207
00:56:53,510 --> 00:56:55,273
but l've had more sex
than you can imagine

1208
00:56:55,345 --> 00:56:56,334
and l'm hlv negative.

1209
00:56:56,413 --> 00:56:58,142
and l sure as fuck never
got anyone pregnant.

1210
00:56:58,214 --> 00:56:59,841
we applaud your
clever virility.

1211
00:56:59,916 --> 00:57:01,110
you know what
this is about?

1212
00:57:01,184 --> 00:57:03,049
you're jealous because l'm
the most sexually liberated.

1213
00:57:03,119 --> 00:57:04,609
oh, real liberated.

1214
00:57:04,687 --> 00:57:06,382
lt goes a little
something like this:

1215
00:57:06,456 --> 00:57:08,048
you're in, you're out,
you're done, it's over.

1216
00:57:08,124 --> 00:57:09,352
what's your name again?

1217
00:57:09,426 --> 00:57:10,893
l just shared the most
intimate gift with you,

1218
00:57:10,960 --> 00:57:12,393
but suddenly you scare me.
see ya.

1219
00:57:12,462 --> 00:57:13,929
gay men love
and you know it.

1220
00:57:13,997 --> 00:57:15,294
you only want to think
it's not as real

1221
00:57:15,365 --> 00:57:17,162
as the love you feel because
then you'd have to admit

1222
00:57:17,233 --> 00:57:18,461
you don't have as much sex.

1223
00:57:18,535 --> 00:57:19,832
rafe, l know gay couples.

1224
00:57:19,903 --> 00:57:21,734
most exist in open
relationships.

1225
00:57:21,805 --> 00:57:23,796
there's plenty of monogamy
in gay relationships.

1226
00:57:23,873 --> 00:57:25,340
maybe in their 30s.

1227
00:57:25,408 --> 00:57:28,844
but the late teens and 20s
are one big blur of dick!

1228
00:57:28,912 --> 00:57:31,312
why are you so
desperate for monogamy?

1229
00:57:31,381 --> 00:57:33,679
what good has it
ever done for you?

1230
00:57:33,750 --> 00:57:35,274
you think sexually
frustrated, monogamous women

1231
00:57:35,351 --> 00:57:36,943
are better equipped to love?

1232
00:57:37,020 --> 00:57:39,045
you can't deny that
there's something special

1233
00:57:39,122 --> 00:57:41,590
that happens between two people
when there's a commitment.

1234
00:57:41,658 --> 00:57:43,523
and you can't admit
that sex is just a glorified

1235
00:57:43,593 --> 00:57:46,221
bodily function that you
want to strangle in emotions.

1236
00:57:46,296 --> 00:57:48,161
love everyone or love
no one is my motto.

1237
00:57:48,231 --> 00:57:49,630
lf anybody cares.

1238
00:57:49,699 --> 00:57:50,723
what?

1239
00:57:50,800 --> 00:57:53,826
l said, love everyone or
love no one is my motto.

1240
00:57:53,903 --> 00:57:56,167
lf anybody cares.

1241
00:57:56,239 --> 00:57:58,104
sorry, but when you have
sex on a regular basis

1242
00:57:58,174 --> 00:58:00,734
without love
you're a whore.

1243
00:58:00,810 --> 00:58:03,040
rafe, you're a whore.

1244
00:58:03,112 --> 00:58:05,672
but that's a good thing
for guys, right j.d.?

1245
00:58:05,748 --> 00:58:08,273
this is a land mine
and l need my legs.

1246
00:58:08,351 --> 00:58:10,512
so fear of whore-dom is
the reason why lesbians

1247
00:58:10,587 --> 00:58:12,578
fall in love so quickly?

1248
00:58:12,655 --> 00:58:14,646
now we know the truth about
u-hauls and china patterns.

1249
00:58:14,724 --> 00:58:16,589
l don't want to
fight with you, rafe.

1250
00:58:16,659 --> 00:58:19,423
l want you to think
about this place.

1251
00:58:19,496 --> 00:58:21,794
lt's full of majesty.

1252
00:58:21,865 --> 00:58:24,993
the world is right
and you're right -

1253
00:58:25,068 --> 00:58:26,365
and everything's right.

1254
00:58:26,436 --> 00:58:27,960
what the fuck
is your point?

1255
00:58:28,037 --> 00:58:29,971
we know where to go,
we just don't know

1256
00:58:30,039 --> 00:58:31,438
the proper way to get there.

1257
00:58:31,508 --> 00:58:33,999
- lt's about the orgasm.
- lt's about the feeling.

1258
00:58:34,077 --> 00:58:35,567
leading to the thought.

1259
00:58:35,645 --> 00:58:37,169
does your bicked and
extremely ugly pussy

1260
00:58:37,247 --> 00:58:38,509
ever figure into this?

1261
00:58:38,581 --> 00:58:40,549
or are we talking about
ventriloquist orgasms here?

1262
00:58:40,617 --> 00:58:42,710
you know full well
what l'm saying.

1263
00:58:42,785 --> 00:58:46,619
an orgasm is an experience
and not a gush of fluid.

1264
00:58:46,689 --> 00:58:49,055
how can you speak for me?
for men?

1265
00:58:49,125 --> 00:58:50,717
for other women?

1266
00:58:50,793 --> 00:58:52,420
what if you're wrong
and you've been missing out

1267
00:58:52,495 --> 00:58:54,258
on all this incredible sex?

1268
00:58:54,330 --> 00:58:57,731
ln fact, when was your last
earth-shattering orgasm?

1269
00:58:57,800 --> 00:59:00,860
l can remember
the day clearly.

1270
00:59:00,937 --> 00:59:03,838
the birds were singing,
the flowers were blooming

1271
00:59:03,907 --> 00:59:05,534
and everything was
right in the world.

1272
00:59:05,608 --> 00:59:06,836
you can't remember.

1273
00:59:06,910 --> 00:59:09,174
- l have them all the time.
-always with people you love?

1274
00:59:09,245 --> 00:59:10,177
- yes.
- never a stranger?

1275
00:59:10,246 --> 00:59:11,577
never.

1276
00:59:11,648 --> 00:59:13,878
my last earth shattering
orgasm was with a stranger.

1277
00:59:13,950 --> 00:59:16,646
l can do this because my
orgasms aren't conditional.

1278
00:59:16,719 --> 00:59:20,246
unlike you, heidi, l come
and l'm done and l'm happy.

1279
00:59:20,323 --> 00:59:21,847
but you always want
something in return.

1280
00:59:21,925 --> 00:59:24,120
and yet you're single,
no different than me.

1281
00:59:24,193 --> 00:59:26,354
but tomorrow l can
fulfill my sexual needs.

1282
00:59:26,429 --> 00:59:28,363
you can't claim that, can you?

1283
00:59:28,431 --> 00:59:31,696
and if l fucked you, you'd be
screaming like a schoolgirl.

1284
00:59:31,768 --> 00:59:33,429
you'd have to reevaluate
your whole routine.

1285
00:59:33,503 --> 00:59:34,993
so l guess under
these conditions

1286
00:59:35,071 --> 00:59:36,368
l'd get real angry, too.

1287
00:59:36,439 --> 00:59:37,838
would you be angry
after sex with me?

1288
00:59:37,907 --> 00:59:40,068
- l have no anger, remember?
- only fear.

1289
00:59:40,143 --> 00:59:42,668
my point about you, rafe,
is that you're a great guy

1290
00:59:42,745 --> 00:59:44,610
with a lot of
positive energy.

1291
00:59:44,681 --> 00:59:46,649
but until you connect
emotionally with your

1292
00:59:46,716 --> 00:59:49,241
sex partners,
you're never going to be free.

1293
00:59:49,319 --> 00:59:52,288
and for god's sake,
get their first name.

1294
00:59:53,957 --> 00:59:55,925
okay.

1295
00:59:55,992 --> 00:59:58,153
l promise to become
emotionally involved

1296
00:59:58,227 --> 01:00:00,889
with my sex partners
if you promise to have sex

1297
01:00:00,964 --> 01:00:03,432
with someone you don't love.

1298
01:00:03,499 --> 01:00:04,989
like me.

1299
01:00:05,068 --> 01:00:06,695
come on, heidi,
let's get it on.

1300
01:00:06,769 --> 01:00:08,430
rafe, you're not in
high school anymore.

1301
01:00:08,504 --> 01:00:09,869
you don't have
anything to prove.

1302
01:00:09,939 --> 01:00:11,770
yes, l do.

1303
01:00:11,841 --> 01:00:14,571
kris, would you
have sex with me?

1304
01:00:14,644 --> 01:00:16,271
right now?.

1305
01:00:16,346 --> 01:00:18,211
sure, why not?

1306
01:00:34,030 --> 01:00:35,793
lt's really not that gross.

1307
01:00:35,865 --> 01:00:38,060
like j.d. says -
friction and goo.

1308
01:00:38,134 --> 01:00:40,770
rafe, you're
missing my point.

1309
01:00:40,770 --> 01:00:41,099
rafe, you're
missing my point.

1310
01:01:09,565 --> 01:01:11,055
my, my, my.

1311
01:01:11,134 --> 01:01:13,602
we have a bit of
an arousal here.

1312
01:01:14,704 --> 01:01:16,035
this is pathetic!

1313
01:01:16,105 --> 01:01:18,164
you guys, stop.
l'm serious.

1314
01:01:18,241 --> 01:01:21,176
why?
you have.

1315
01:01:25,281 --> 01:01:27,249
now kiss me.

1316
01:01:36,526 --> 01:01:40,428
now look at me like l'm
the only girl you'll ever love.

1317
01:01:40,496 --> 01:01:41,895
and find that place
in your heart

1318
01:01:41,964 --> 01:01:44,364
where you really mean it.
and then please yourself

1319
01:01:44,434 --> 01:01:46,368
with the thought of the
love you have for me.

1320
01:01:46,436 --> 01:02:06,244
okay?

1321
01:02:06,322 --> 01:02:08,017
you're doing fine, okay?

1322
01:02:08,091 --> 01:02:10,491
just be creative.
figure out what l like.

1323
01:02:10,560 --> 01:02:12,721
give it to me.

1324
01:02:17,500 --> 01:02:19,127
quick learner.

1325
01:02:22,171 --> 01:02:24,696
dude...
lt happens.

1326
01:02:24,774 --> 01:02:26,469
fuck off.

1327
01:02:26,542 --> 01:02:29,340
was it too freudian
or jungian?

1328
01:02:29,412 --> 01:02:30,970
lt was probably jungian.

1329
01:02:31,047 --> 01:02:34,483
so you're bisexual,
but emotionally terrified?

1330
01:02:34,550 --> 01:02:37,178
like he's bisexual
and afraid of being stigmatized.

1331
01:02:37,253 --> 01:02:39,448
felt like l just
fucked my sister.

1332
01:02:39,522 --> 01:02:40,750
stop generalizing us.

1333
01:02:40,823 --> 01:02:42,154
well, if there's one thing
l've learned tonight

1334
01:02:42,225 --> 01:02:43,988
is that we all reduce
each other to sex.

1335
01:02:44,060 --> 01:02:45,891
you're dealing with
old issues.

1336
01:02:45,962 --> 01:02:47,395
l need a shower.

1337
01:02:47,463 --> 01:02:49,931
you might want
to rephrase that.

1338
01:02:49,999 --> 01:02:51,364
lt wasn't very nice.

1339
01:02:51,434 --> 01:02:52,992
that's not what l meant.

1340
01:02:56,506 --> 01:02:58,667
lt smells like sex in here.

1341
01:02:58,741 --> 01:03:00,902
l'm gonna have
to call rosa again.

1342
01:03:07,483 --> 01:03:09,178
go get him.

1343
01:03:09,252 --> 01:03:11,277
and while you're
at it, apologize.

1344
01:03:11,354 --> 01:03:12,514
why, what did l do?

1345
01:03:12,588 --> 01:03:14,488
l'm sure you can think
of tons of things.

1346
01:03:17,493 --> 01:03:19,154
go!

1347
01:03:23,733 --> 01:03:25,894
that was like watching
a train wreck.

1348
01:03:25,968 --> 01:03:27,026
that?

1349
01:03:27,103 --> 01:03:28,263
that was easy.

1350
01:03:28,337 --> 01:03:30,601
open your mind,
open your legs.

1351
01:03:30,673 --> 01:03:33,039
you really are a whore,
aren't you?

1352
01:03:33,109 --> 01:03:36,738
to let some guy just do that,
in front of an audience.

1353
01:03:36,813 --> 01:03:39,077
and you're not even
angry at his reaction?

1354
01:03:39,148 --> 01:03:40,979
let me tell you
something, sweetie.

1355
01:03:41,050 --> 01:03:44,247
what you call being a whore,
l call being experienced.

1356
01:03:44,320 --> 01:03:47,619
l'm skillful at my craft and l
don't mind teaching beginners.

1357
01:03:47,690 --> 01:03:50,284
and l didn't get paid,
so technically not a whore.

1358
01:03:50,359 --> 01:03:51,758
oh, it was.

1359
01:03:51,828 --> 01:03:53,762
l was intimate with a
man who didn't want

1360
01:03:53,830 --> 01:03:55,923
to be intimate with me and l
did it without blinking an eye

1361
01:03:55,998 --> 01:03:58,159
because l am a
generous person.

1362
01:03:58,234 --> 01:03:59,963
however you want
to phrase it.

1363
01:04:00,036 --> 01:04:01,526
fucking whore.

1364
01:04:01,604 --> 01:04:03,970
l just performed
community service.

1365
01:04:04,040 --> 01:04:06,099
that man, he's going
to recover and be

1366
01:04:06,175 --> 01:04:07,642
a better human being for it.

1367
01:04:07,710 --> 01:04:10,702
lf l'm not concerned about it,
why the fuck are you?

1368
01:04:10,780 --> 01:04:12,509
- you toy with people.
- and you don't?

1369
01:04:12,582 --> 01:04:14,345
not like you do.
lt's cruel.

1370
01:04:14,417 --> 01:04:16,180
why?

1371
01:04:16,252 --> 01:04:18,652
because it's
not what you want?

1372
01:04:18,721 --> 01:04:21,349
the world doesn't
revolve around heidi.

1373
01:04:27,263 --> 01:04:28,958
l could fuck you in a second.

1374
01:04:29,031 --> 01:04:31,522
spoken like a truck driver.

1375
01:04:31,601 --> 01:04:36,129
l could show you places
in yourself you've never seen.

1376
01:04:36,205 --> 01:04:39,436
confidence in my dike, l like.

1377
01:04:39,508 --> 01:04:41,999
can you do it
without a strap-on?

1378
01:04:42,078 --> 01:04:44,376
l could show you how to feel,

1379
01:04:44,447 --> 01:04:46,176
where to feel it,

1380
01:04:46,249 --> 01:04:48,979
and why you've never
felt it before.

1381
01:04:49,051 --> 01:04:51,849
l could do all these
things, but l won't.

1382
01:04:51,921 --> 01:04:53,218
do what?

1383
01:04:53,289 --> 01:04:55,154
show me the
definition of more.

1384
01:04:55,224 --> 01:04:57,055
less is more
is a great slogan.

1385
01:04:57,126 --> 01:04:58,525
l'm bushed.
pun intended.

1386
01:04:58,594 --> 01:05:00,755
this evening is so over.

1387
01:05:00,830 --> 01:05:02,058
lsn't that curious?

1388
01:05:02,131 --> 01:05:03,962
the big, bad gays scurry
away with their tails

1389
01:05:04,033 --> 01:05:05,500
between their legs.

1390
01:05:05,568 --> 01:05:08,662
l say this with love,
but fuck you, and goodnight.

1391
01:05:11,140 --> 01:05:13,938
they do it in new york.
and the middle east.

1392
01:05:19,515 --> 01:05:21,142
did he get
lipstick on me?

1393
01:05:21,217 --> 01:05:22,980
l heard that!

1394
01:05:24,620 --> 01:05:27,214
so, what?
was this your big plan?

1395
01:05:27,290 --> 01:05:29,155
lt seems kind of like a
premature ejaculation,

1396
01:05:29,225 --> 01:05:30,556
if you ask me.

1397
01:05:30,626 --> 01:05:32,787
lt's just too bad
it's all over.

1398
01:05:36,999 --> 01:05:40,696
so, what do you say
that you and l

1399
01:05:40,770 --> 01:05:44,729
hop in the sack...
and we bang out a couple of os.

1400
01:05:46,175 --> 01:05:48,143
thanks, but no.

1401
01:05:53,382 --> 01:05:54,906
ow.

1402
01:05:56,185 --> 01:05:58,551
we were really starting
to make progress though.

1403
01:05:58,621 --> 01:06:00,987
lt's a shame
they got scared.

1404
01:06:01,824 --> 01:06:04,156
you know, when l was a kid
l wanted to be a magician

1405
01:06:04,226 --> 01:06:07,252
so that l could make
myself disappear.

1406
01:06:07,330 --> 01:06:13,758
but try as hard as my parents
and l did, it never happened.

1407
01:06:13,836 --> 01:06:18,933
but, l did learn a
couple of other tricks.

1408
01:06:19,008 --> 01:06:23,411
like...sleight of hand.

1409
01:06:24,714 --> 01:06:26,579
dirty whore.

1410
01:06:26,649 --> 01:06:29,015
you want sex with both
of them at this point.

1411
01:06:30,486 --> 01:06:32,579
dirty, dirty.

1412
01:06:34,023 --> 01:06:35,923
whore, whore.

1413
01:06:37,059 --> 01:06:39,926
oh, and by the way...

1414
01:06:39,996 --> 01:06:42,658
l thought you might want
your necklace back.

1415
01:06:56,412 --> 01:06:58,471
[phone ringing]

1416
01:06:58,547 --> 01:07:00,378
ls that yours?

1417
01:07:19,502 --> 01:07:21,299
should l?

1418
01:07:21,370 --> 01:07:23,304
you know you want to.

1419
01:07:23,372 --> 01:07:25,533
just fuckin' do it.

1420
01:07:28,077 --> 01:07:30,011
hello?

1421
01:07:30,079 --> 01:07:32,946
oh, hi, kate.
how are you?

1422
01:07:33,015 --> 01:07:35,040
yeah, yeah,
heidi was here.

1423
01:07:35,117 --> 01:07:37,017
yeah.
we were here all day.

1424
01:07:37,086 --> 01:07:38,485
are you sick?

1425
01:07:38,554 --> 01:07:41,182
your voice- you sound
a little hoarse honey.

1426
01:07:41,257 --> 01:07:43,748
oh, she left about
20 minutes ago.

1427
01:07:43,826 --> 01:07:45,726
are you guys
still together?

1428
01:07:48,464 --> 01:07:51,763
l don't know, she's just acting
kind of weird and stuff.

1429
01:07:51,834 --> 01:07:54,029
oh, you guys haven't been
together for a while?

1430
01:07:54,103 --> 01:07:55,798
what happened?

1431
01:07:58,541 --> 01:07:59,974
that was my, um...

1432
01:08:00,042 --> 01:08:03,011
it was the, um, vibrator.

1433
01:08:03,079 --> 01:08:05,138
yeah, l was-

1434
01:08:05,214 --> 01:08:06,442
l'm a little fucked up.

1435
01:08:06,515 --> 01:08:08,642
l can't believe
l just told you that.

1436
01:08:10,586 --> 01:08:13,077
no, l'm sorry.
seriously though, what happened?

1437
01:08:13,155 --> 01:08:15,248
let me put this
vibrator away.

1438
01:08:16,892 --> 01:08:18,860
okay, l'm sorry about that.

1439
01:08:20,629 --> 01:08:22,597
oh, really?

1440
01:08:25,634 --> 01:08:28,865
she really did that?

1441
01:08:31,807 --> 01:08:34,469
oh, kate, l'm sorry.

1442
01:08:35,778 --> 01:08:38,713
well, if you need to
talk or anything

1443
01:08:38,781 --> 01:08:41,477
l had a similar experience
like that, so...

1444
01:08:41,550 --> 01:08:42,744
l'm home a lot.

1445
01:08:44,920 --> 01:08:47,013
you remember
where l live?

1446
01:08:47,089 --> 01:08:50,252
l'll probably be here
for another month or so.

1447
01:08:51,494 --> 01:08:52,620
okay, baby.

1448
01:08:52,695 --> 01:08:54,287
yeah, okay.

1449
01:08:54,363 --> 01:08:58,527
all right.
take care of that throat.

1450
01:08:58,601 --> 01:09:00,466
l'll talk to you later.
bye.

1451
01:09:06,008 --> 01:09:07,475
well, what?

1452
01:09:07,543 --> 01:09:08,976
what did she say?

1453
01:09:09,044 --> 01:09:10,511
you were sitting
right here, busybody.

1454
01:09:10,579 --> 01:09:11,841
don't worry about
what she said.

1455
01:09:11,914 --> 01:09:13,882
they're just not
together anymore.

1456
01:09:30,366 --> 01:09:31,993
hey, it's me.

1457
01:09:38,641 --> 01:09:42,008
no...
it's been a weird evening.

1458
01:09:42,077 --> 01:09:44,773
l lost my keys.
can l come home?

1459
01:09:51,453 --> 01:09:53,921
what?

1460
01:10:02,131 --> 01:10:04,031
lt's open.

1461
01:10:04,099 --> 01:10:05,760
lf you dare to enter.

1462
01:10:11,407 --> 01:10:13,068
how fucking dare you?

1463
01:10:13,142 --> 01:10:14,268
who fucking
spiked my drink?

1464
01:10:14,343 --> 01:10:15,674
l'm going to kick
some fucking ass

1465
01:10:15,744 --> 01:10:16,904
because that's pretty
much not very cool.

1466
01:10:16,979 --> 01:10:18,606
- did you?
- no.

1467
01:10:18,681 --> 01:10:19,841
j.d.?

1468
01:10:19,915 --> 01:10:21,212
welcome to hedonism.

1469
01:10:21,283 --> 01:10:23,717
dude, chill the fuck out!
jesus!

1470
01:10:23,786 --> 01:10:25,686
where's my phone?

1471
01:10:27,089 --> 01:10:29,387
so l spiked your drink!

1472
01:10:29,458 --> 01:10:32,052
l could have done
the hit myself.

1473
01:10:32,127 --> 01:10:34,823
maybe l just wanted
to be closer to you.

1474
01:10:37,266 --> 01:10:39,666
what?
you're gonna cut us now?

1475
01:10:39,735 --> 01:10:41,168
scary!

1476
01:10:41,237 --> 01:10:43,171
where the fuck
are my keys?

1477
01:10:43,239 --> 01:10:44,297
ask fratboy.

1478
01:10:44,373 --> 01:10:45,840
hold on, hold on.

1479
01:10:45,908 --> 01:10:47,273
so l slipped something
in your drink,

1480
01:10:47,343 --> 01:10:49,368
and l stole your keys.

1481
01:10:49,445 --> 01:10:51,345
are you guys fucking
dead to a new adventure?

1482
01:10:51,413 --> 01:10:53,381
l just want to get the
fuck out of here, okay?

1483
01:10:53,449 --> 01:10:54,507
fuck this heidi,
let's call aaa--

1484
01:10:54,583 --> 01:10:56,141
why don't you suck
my fucking dick!

1485
01:10:56,218 --> 01:10:57,480
'cause your fucking
dick is ugly.

1486
01:10:57,553 --> 01:10:59,043
l don't need this
fucking bullshit.

1487
01:10:59,121 --> 01:11:00,679
why?
what else you got going on?

1488
01:11:00,756 --> 01:11:03,418
just stop it, okay?

1489
01:11:03,492 --> 01:11:07,485
l have had you figured
out for so long...

1490
01:11:07,563 --> 01:11:09,656
kate just filled in the blanks.

1491
01:11:09,732 --> 01:11:11,757
what the fuck did
you guys talk about?

1492
01:11:11,834 --> 01:11:14,234
why would you do that?

1493
01:11:14,303 --> 01:11:16,294
your phone was ringing
so l picked it up.

1494
01:11:16,372 --> 01:11:18,135
big fucking deal.

1495
01:11:18,207 --> 01:11:19,674
so l talked to kate.

1496
01:11:19,742 --> 01:11:23,075
we had a very
nice conversation.

1497
01:11:23,145 --> 01:11:26,911
she pretty much confirmed
everything l already knew.

1498
01:11:26,982 --> 01:11:31,316
so tough, but so needy.

1499
01:11:31,387 --> 01:11:34,151
love and love,
but when they leave -

1500
01:11:34,223 --> 01:11:37,021
you don't take that
very well, do you?

1501
01:11:37,092 --> 01:11:38,821
and you get mad, don't ya?

1502
01:11:38,894 --> 01:11:41,624
kris -- she's on drugs!
she's got a fucking knife.

1503
01:11:41,697 --> 01:11:43,324
and you're pushing
her buttons.

1504
01:11:43,399 --> 01:11:45,367
heidi knows what
l'm talking about.

1505
01:11:47,603 --> 01:11:51,972
she's got j.d's m.o. down.

1506
01:11:52,041 --> 01:11:54,407
you know why?

1507
01:11:54,476 --> 01:11:57,445
'cause she beat the crap
out of poor little kate.

1508
01:12:03,319 --> 01:12:05,685
you're real good, huh?

1509
01:12:05,754 --> 01:12:07,449
put the joke on everyone
else so you don't

1510
01:12:07,523 --> 01:12:09,320
have to talk
about yourself.

1511
01:12:09,391 --> 01:12:11,859
you've done an amazing job.

1512
01:12:11,927 --> 01:12:13,588
well, now it's your turn.

1513
01:12:13,662 --> 01:12:14,720
l'm going to ask you
a simple question.

1514
01:12:14,797 --> 01:12:16,389
let's see if you
can answer it.

1515
01:12:16,465 --> 01:12:18,660
why the fuck
are you doing this?

1516
01:12:18,734 --> 01:12:22,727
because...l was bored.

1517
01:12:22,805 --> 01:12:26,297
no, you know what?
that's not it.

1518
01:12:26,375 --> 01:12:28,605
you are like you are
because you're scared.

1519
01:12:28,677 --> 01:12:30,269
you scared that no
one's gonna love you,

1520
01:12:30,346 --> 01:12:32,314
so you love everyone.

1521
01:12:32,381 --> 01:12:35,248
that is called being a whore,
just so you know.

1522
01:12:35,317 --> 01:12:37,342
you can't even see the
people who want to love you

1523
01:12:37,419 --> 01:12:39,353
because you won't let them.

1524
01:12:39,421 --> 01:12:41,548
everything is just a defense
mechanism with you,

1525
01:12:41,623 --> 01:12:43,989
all this bullshit you
cloak yourself up with-

1526
01:12:44,059 --> 01:12:46,391
lf you are going to continue
on with this monologue...

1527
01:12:46,462 --> 01:12:48,862
l need another drink.

1528
01:12:48,931 --> 01:12:50,796
l could use some popcorn.

1529
01:12:50,866 --> 01:12:53,502
just be real!
for once, kris!

1530
01:12:53,502 --> 01:12:54,833
just be real!
for once, kris!

1531
01:12:54,903 --> 01:12:57,736
- you want me to be real?
- yeah.

1532
01:12:57,806 --> 01:13:01,173
okay, how's this for real?

1533
01:13:01,243 --> 01:13:05,373
l'm real tired of this
butch ass, lce princess routine

1534
01:13:05,447 --> 01:13:09,076
you got going on and l'd like
to get to know the real heidi.

1535
01:13:09,151 --> 01:13:12,985
hello, is she in there?

1536
01:13:13,055 --> 01:13:14,579
lt's not just me
you're talking about.

1537
01:13:14,656 --> 01:13:16,055
you're talking
about all of them.

1538
01:13:16,125 --> 01:13:17,820
women?
yeah.

1539
01:13:17,893 --> 01:13:19,986
lt all goes back to that.

1540
01:13:20,062 --> 01:13:22,758
women destroy everything.

1541
01:13:24,800 --> 01:13:28,566
you've never had any close
female friends, have you?

1542
01:13:28,637 --> 01:13:31,731
don't be ridiculous.
l have female friends.

1543
01:13:31,807 --> 01:13:34,742
rafe, you're my friend, right?

1544
01:13:34,810 --> 01:13:36,437
fucking cunt.

1545
01:13:36,512 --> 01:13:38,639
oh, my god.

1546
01:13:38,714 --> 01:13:40,773
you've created this
whole fucking evening

1547
01:13:40,849 --> 01:13:42,612
just so we wouldn't leave.

1548
01:13:42,684 --> 01:13:44,083
like l told him earlier,

1549
01:13:44,153 --> 01:13:46,280
it's hard to find people
to talk to anymore.

1550
01:13:46,355 --> 01:13:47,788
oh my god, kris-

1551
01:13:47,856 --> 01:13:49,483
stop with the sympathy!

1552
01:13:49,558 --> 01:13:51,185
l have female friends
and they're dear to me

1553
01:13:51,260 --> 01:13:53,285
just like you are.

1554
01:13:53,362 --> 01:13:57,321
and...just like you,
they're difficult.

1555
01:14:00,102 --> 01:14:01,865
we live in the
same world, heidi.

1556
01:14:01,937 --> 01:14:04,633
people only have two
opinions of us -

1557
01:14:04,706 --> 01:14:08,733
bitch or whore.
lt's really not fair.

1558
01:14:08,811 --> 01:14:12,713
people prejudge me because
l'm naturally sexual.

1559
01:14:12,781 --> 01:14:14,908
how does it feel when
people hate you

1560
01:14:14,983 --> 01:14:17,247
before you even
open your mouth?

1561
01:14:17,319 --> 01:14:19,378
people don't hate me.

1562
01:14:19,455 --> 01:14:22,424
honestly?
ya think?

1563
01:14:22,491 --> 01:14:24,516
people don't hate you?

1564
01:14:24,593 --> 01:14:27,061
heidi, you're gay.

1565
01:14:27,129 --> 01:14:29,563
you're hot.
and you're a woman.

1566
01:14:29,631 --> 01:14:31,428
people hate you.

1567
01:14:31,500 --> 01:14:34,162
well, fuck anyone who does.

1568
01:14:34,236 --> 01:14:36,329
and by the way -
l've never hated you.

1569
01:14:36,405 --> 01:14:38,999
yeah, well, you've
never loved me either.

1570
01:14:39,074 --> 01:14:42,009
j.d. was right about you.

1571
01:14:42,077 --> 01:14:44,477
when kate came into the
picture, we were dead to you.

1572
01:14:44,546 --> 01:14:46,571
and that's not hate,
but it's indifference.

1573
01:14:46,648 --> 01:14:48,138
and indifference
is close to dislike.

1574
01:14:48,217 --> 01:14:51,675
dislike is close to fear;
fear is the completion of hate.

1575
01:14:51,753 --> 01:14:53,721
you take me for granted
just like almost everyone

1576
01:14:53,789 --> 01:14:55,279
l want to love.

1577
01:14:55,357 --> 01:14:57,018
men, women -
it doesn't matter.

1578
01:14:57,092 --> 01:14:58,957
you can't look at me
and see what's in my heart.

1579
01:14:59,027 --> 01:15:00,892
all you see
is the exterior.

1580
01:15:00,963 --> 01:15:02,897
you have my attention
and you know it.

1581
01:15:02,965 --> 01:15:05,195
l don't want that
kind of attention!

1582
01:15:05,267 --> 01:15:07,827
and l don't want your pain,
or your pity.

1583
01:15:07,903 --> 01:15:09,427
l want your friendship.

1584
01:15:09,505 --> 01:15:12,474
your true friendship.

1585
01:15:12,541 --> 01:15:14,441
what are you asking of me?

1586
01:15:14,510 --> 01:15:17,502
lt's not just you,
you myopic fucking bitch!

1587
01:15:17,579 --> 01:15:19,672
lt's every fucking
woman on the planet -

1588
01:15:19,748 --> 01:15:22,478
every single one of them
competing and belittling

1589
01:15:22,551 --> 01:15:24,678
anything that fucking
threatens them!

1590
01:15:24,753 --> 01:15:26,721
maybe l'm not so
fucking put together.

1591
01:15:29,124 --> 01:15:30,648
maybe l don't
have the answers.

1592
01:15:30,726 --> 01:15:33,354
but l do know things
are fucked!

1593
01:15:35,063 --> 01:15:37,861
and l don't want them
fucked up anymore.

1594
01:15:37,933 --> 01:15:39,332
you guys, can
you please leave?

1595
01:15:39,401 --> 01:15:40,663
kris, you're
just fucked up.

1596
01:15:40,736 --> 01:15:41,930
no!

1597
01:15:42,004 --> 01:15:44,495
lf one woman can't love
me then no women can.

1598
01:15:44,573 --> 01:15:47,633
that's the truth
and that's the way l feel.

1599
01:15:47,709 --> 01:15:49,677
you guys gotta go!

1600
01:15:49,745 --> 01:15:51,110
get the fuck
out of my house.

1601
01:15:52,281 --> 01:15:53,714
go.

1602
01:15:55,183 --> 01:15:57,481
l have love for you
and you know it.

1603
01:15:57,553 --> 01:15:59,714
you're only saying this
because you know it.

1604
01:16:02,791 --> 01:16:04,315
look at me.

1605
01:16:05,794 --> 01:16:07,421
look at me!

1606
01:16:09,398 --> 01:16:11,025
you don't love.

1607
01:16:11,099 --> 01:16:12,498
you smother.

1608
01:16:12,568 --> 01:16:14,001
now get the fuck
out of my house.

1609
01:16:14,069 --> 01:16:15,468
you fucking whore!

1610
01:16:15,537 --> 01:16:16,595
fucking bitch!

1611
01:16:16,672 --> 01:16:18,640
you don't love!
you only hurt!

1612
01:16:20,008 --> 01:16:21,441
who did this to you?

1613
01:16:21,510 --> 01:16:23,307
you didn't!
and that's the fucking problem!

1614
01:16:23,378 --> 01:16:25,437
that's it!
enough!

1615
01:16:28,016 --> 01:16:30,007
holy shit!
rafe!

1616
01:16:30,085 --> 01:16:33,111
what, did you fucking cut
him with your little knife?

1617
01:16:33,188 --> 01:16:34,416
no one cut him!

1618
01:16:34,489 --> 01:16:36,548
- jesus christ.
- are you okay, rafe?

1619
01:16:36,625 --> 01:16:38,388
lt's fine.

1620
01:16:38,460 --> 01:16:39,893
do you have band-aids,
a first aid kit?

1621
01:16:39,962 --> 01:16:42,328
come on!

1622
01:16:42,397 --> 01:16:44,228
lt's in the bathroom
under the sink.

1623
01:16:44,299 --> 01:16:46,267
lf she didn't cut you then why
the fuck are you bleeding?

1624
01:16:46,335 --> 01:16:48,098
when you get stabbed really
close to the heart,

1625
01:16:48,170 --> 01:16:49,535
sometimes it doesn't heal.

1626
01:16:49,605 --> 01:16:50,469
she stabbed you?

1627
01:16:50,539 --> 01:16:52,530
she didn't stab me - my
sister did - when l was five.

1628
01:16:52,608 --> 01:16:53,973
why would she do that?

1629
01:16:54,042 --> 01:16:56,135
'cause women are
fucking psycho!

1630
01:16:57,512 --> 01:16:59,878
yeah...
he's kind of right.

1631
01:17:16,198 --> 01:17:18,598
l'm sorry...

1632
01:17:18,667 --> 01:17:21,636
about kate,
about everything.

1633
01:17:21,703 --> 01:17:24,171
l'm sorry.

1634
01:17:30,879 --> 01:17:33,814
kris, what's going on with you?

1635
01:17:33,882 --> 01:17:35,850
for real?

1636
01:18:10,752 --> 01:18:12,219
god damn.

1637
01:18:15,357 --> 01:18:17,052
hold that.

1638
01:18:21,897 --> 01:18:23,922
condoms in the first aid kit.

1639
01:18:32,107 --> 01:18:33,836
you look a little pale.

1640
01:18:33,909 --> 01:18:35,342
l'll be fine.

1641
01:18:35,410 --> 01:18:37,378
- crap.
- this tape sucks.

1642
01:18:40,649 --> 01:18:43,675
there you go.
good as new.

1643
01:18:43,752 --> 01:18:45,879
l think l need
more on the top.

1644
01:18:54,963 --> 01:18:56,988
now you're good as new.

1645
01:18:58,967 --> 01:19:01,231
what do you think
the girls are doing?

1646
01:19:01,303 --> 01:19:04,431
reading sylvia plath
and making a suicide pact?

1647
01:19:06,808 --> 01:19:10,437
we have such fantastic lives
and we don't appreciate them.

1648
01:19:12,280 --> 01:19:14,510
why is that?

1649
01:19:14,583 --> 01:19:16,813
lt's because of fear.

1650
01:19:16,885 --> 01:19:18,785
but what are we afraid of?

1651
01:19:18,854 --> 01:19:21,084
life.

1652
01:19:21,156 --> 01:19:24,250
then why are we born fucked?

1653
01:19:24,326 --> 01:19:28,023
because we don't know
what to do.

1654
01:19:28,096 --> 01:19:29,859
maybe we do.

1655
01:19:29,931 --> 01:19:32,195
lt's really simple.

1656
01:19:32,267 --> 01:19:35,134
just love.

1657
01:19:36,171 --> 01:19:38,105
do l have a fever?

1658
01:19:40,475 --> 01:19:42,602
no, it's just the drugs.

1659
01:19:59,294 --> 01:20:01,159
what's this?

1660
01:20:01,229 --> 01:20:03,254
a communion.

1661
01:20:24,052 --> 01:20:26,953
so what was the secret
you were gonna tell me?

1662
01:20:54,249 --> 01:20:55,978
remember happiness?

1663
01:20:56,051 --> 01:20:59,020
yeah...

1664
01:20:59,087 --> 01:21:01,282
l remember.

1665
01:21:02,257 --> 01:21:05,226
why did we forget?

1666
01:21:05,293 --> 01:21:11,254
because...they killed us
for loving ourselves.

1667
01:21:20,108 --> 01:21:22,736
lt's okay.

1668
01:21:22,811 --> 01:21:26,508
you're safe.

1669
01:21:26,581 --> 01:21:28,845
lie back.

1670
01:21:28,917 --> 01:21:32,148
l'm gonna show
you that place now.
