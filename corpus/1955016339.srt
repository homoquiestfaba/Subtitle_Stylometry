00:00:34,201 --> 00:00:35,827
Hello, Mr. Hindle,

2
00:00:35,911 --> 00:00:39,455
or as they caIIed you
around the hospitaI, Zepp.

3
00:00:45,629 --> 00:00:46,963
Game over!

4
00:02:43,497 --> 00:02:44,997
Check it, man.

5
00:03:13,402 --> 00:03:14,527
What the fuck is this?

6
00:03:14,903 --> 00:03:18,072
What the fuck are you doing here?

7
00:03:19,074 --> 00:03:20,408
l'm fucking stuck.

8
00:03:21,118 --> 00:03:22,118
Yeah, me too.

9
00:03:22,744 --> 00:03:24,787
-What the fuck?
-Oh, my God.

10
00:03:25,956 --> 00:03:27,206
Somebody, help us.

11
00:03:27,666 --> 00:03:29,458
-Hello.
-Come on, help us!

12
00:03:32,212 --> 00:03:33,462
Oh, my God!

13
00:03:36,925 --> 00:03:37,884
Dina.

14
00:03:37,968 --> 00:03:39,051
Brad.

15
00:03:40,053 --> 00:03:43,097
-Ryan?
-Baby, are you okay?

16
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:45,349
-Get me out of here!
-Baby.

17
00:03:45,434 --> 00:03:47,935
Help us. Somebody help us!

18
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:50,813
Hey! Call the police!

19
00:03:50,898 --> 00:03:52,523
Hey, break the glass with your case.

20
00:03:52,608 --> 00:03:54,775
Break the fucking glass! Do it.

21
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:56,444
Stay back!

22
00:03:58,071 --> 00:03:59,405
Do it!

23
00:04:00,324 --> 00:04:02,450
-Get me out of here.
-Break it!

24
00:04:07,289 --> 00:04:08,331
Hello, Brad.

25
00:04:09,583 --> 00:04:12,710
HeIIo, Ryan. I'd Iike to pIay a game.

26
00:04:13,378 --> 00:04:16,881
The same woman
has pIayed each of you for a fooI,

27
00:04:16,965 --> 00:04:21,093
manipuIating your Iove for her,
and causing nothing but pain.

28
00:04:21,178 --> 00:04:27,308
Her fun and games pushed you both
to break the law to fulfill her material needs.

29
00:04:27,809 --> 00:04:28,935
She is toxic,

30
00:04:29,353 --> 00:04:34,023
and today aII of your transgressions
wiII be made pubIic.

31
00:04:34,107 --> 00:04:35,650
He's fucking lying, Brad.

32
00:04:35,734 --> 00:04:39,737
Now you must choose who
wiII drop out of this triangIe,

33
00:04:39,821 --> 00:04:43,157
for within 60 seconds one of you must die.

34
00:04:44,368 --> 00:04:47,745
If you wish to save her,
then the saws must be pushed

35
00:04:47,829 --> 00:04:50,623
aII the way to one side or the other,

36
00:04:50,707 --> 00:04:55,544
sparing her whiIe proving for good
who is indeed the aIpha maIe.

37
00:04:55,629 --> 00:04:58,255
What are you fucking staring at,
you motherfuckers?

38
00:04:58,340 --> 00:05:00,549
-Do something!
-Are you both strong enough

39
00:05:00,634 --> 00:05:03,386
to waIk away from what is destroying you,

40
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:07,264
or wiII you fight one more time
for the heart that binds?

41
00:05:08,016 --> 00:05:10,226
You have 60 seconds to decide.

42
00:05:10,644 --> 00:05:13,062
Live or die. Make your choice.

43
00:05:16,108 --> 00:05:17,108
Oh, fuck!

44
00:05:24,282 --> 00:05:26,367
One of you save me!

45
00:05:34,751 --> 00:05:35,751
What the fuck are you doing?

46
00:05:35,836 --> 00:05:38,546
lt's me or you asshole,
and it sure as shit isn't gonna be me.

47
00:05:51,727 --> 00:05:52,893
Brad. Brad.

48
00:05:53,895 --> 00:05:55,104
Brad, l love you.

49
00:05:56,273 --> 00:05:57,565
l love you too, baby.

50
00:05:57,899 --> 00:05:59,734
Do it. You gotta do it.

51
00:05:59,818 --> 00:06:01,694
-What?
-You gotta kill him, Brad.

52
00:06:02,154 --> 00:06:03,863
-Do it!
-Stupid bitch!

53
00:06:03,947 --> 00:06:06,407
Do it. Do it! Do it!

54
00:06:18,128 --> 00:06:19,128
Fuck!

55
00:06:22,257 --> 00:06:23,382
You love him?

56
00:06:23,675 --> 00:06:24,884
No, no.

57
00:06:24,968 --> 00:06:26,427
You love him more than me?

58
00:06:26,762 --> 00:06:28,763
No, l had to say that.

59
00:06:29,097 --> 00:06:30,806
l've always loved you.

60
00:06:31,558 --> 00:06:33,434
You got to do it for me, please.

61
00:06:33,852 --> 00:06:36,395
You got to kill him. Kill Brad! Do it!

62
00:06:37,064 --> 00:06:38,939
You lying slut!

63
00:06:40,067 --> 00:06:41,400
What the fuck are you doing?

64
00:06:41,485 --> 00:06:42,610
You don't love anybody!

65
00:06:44,154 --> 00:06:46,030
You're a cheat and a liar. Fuck you!

66
00:06:46,114 --> 00:06:47,406
Fuck you!

67
00:06:48,533 --> 00:06:50,326
Brad! Brad, look at me!

68
00:06:51,745 --> 00:06:54,789
ls the chick that fucked me in your bed
two days ago worth one of our lives?

69
00:06:55,499 --> 00:06:57,374
She's not worth it, man. She's not worth it.

70
00:06:58,168 --> 00:06:59,168
Right?

71
00:07:01,254 --> 00:07:02,338
Yeah!

72
00:07:02,839 --> 00:07:04,799
What are you doing, you fucking asshole?

73
00:07:05,092 --> 00:07:07,134
l think we're breaking up with you, Dina.

74
00:07:09,888 --> 00:07:12,139
No! No, stop!

75
00:07:19,689 --> 00:07:21,190
-Stand aside!
-Move it!

76
00:07:27,322 --> 00:07:29,073
People, get out of the way.

77
00:07:51,638 --> 00:07:53,097
Somebody help her.

78
00:08:26,590 --> 00:08:27,590
Game over.

79
00:08:27,674 --> 00:08:30,092
No! No, you fucking bitch!

80
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:31,760
No!

81
00:10:12,988 --> 00:10:15,948
Tonight, a house of horrors
has been discovered

82
00:10:16,032 --> 00:10:19,368
at what used to be known
as the Rowan ZooIogicaI Institute.

83
00:10:19,452 --> 00:10:23,789
The body of Umbrella Health CEO
William Easton has been identified

84
00:10:23,873 --> 00:10:27,334
as one of the several victims
of this grizzIy crime scene.

85
00:10:27,419 --> 00:10:29,753
However, we have also been
informed that there may be

86
00:10:29,838 --> 00:10:33,132


as many as seven survivors
from this deadIy event.

87
00:10:33,216 --> 00:10:35,426
HopefuIIy the many questions
of the IocaI poIice,

88
00:10:35,510 --> 00:10:38,804
the FBI, and the victims'
famiIy members may be answered

89
00:10:38,888 --> 00:10:41,056
by those seven civiIians Iucky enough

90
00:10:41,141 --> 00:10:43,434
to waIk away from
this unprecedented dispIay

91
00:10:43,518 --> 00:10:45,561
of carnage with their Iives.

92
00:10:45,645 --> 00:10:50,107
We now go live to Tony Gabrielson
who is reporting from the scene. Tony.

93
00:10:55,989 --> 00:10:58,032
-Hey, man.
-Hey, what's up?

94
00:11:00,035 --> 00:11:02,995
-What have we got here?
-That's Jill Tuck, Jigsaw's widow.

95
00:11:03,079 --> 00:11:04,246
What does she want?

96
00:11:04,331 --> 00:11:06,206
All she said was that
she didn't trust the FBl,

97
00:11:06,916 --> 00:11:09,209
-and she didn't trust homicide.
-Good.

98
00:11:10,003 --> 00:11:12,087
And she just wants to talk to you.

99
00:11:13,465 --> 00:11:16,175
-Why me?
-l don't know. Only you, though.

100
00:11:19,888 --> 00:11:22,431
She looks crazier than a sack full of cats.

101
00:11:24,476 --> 00:11:26,977
All right, let's get this over with.

102
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:35,444
Hey. l put cream and sugar in it.

103
00:11:36,363 --> 00:11:38,280
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

104
00:11:38,365 --> 00:11:40,824
l'm Matt Gibson, internal affairs.

105
00:11:41,409 --> 00:11:43,327
My colleague said that you
wanted to speak with me.

106
00:11:43,411 --> 00:11:44,453
Yes.

107
00:11:45,747 --> 00:11:47,873
But l need complete immunity.

108
00:11:49,834 --> 00:11:51,919
Why do you want immunity, Miss Tuck?

109
00:11:53,671 --> 00:11:55,589
Because of what l know.

110
00:11:56,216 --> 00:11:57,716
Which is what?

111
00:11:59,094 --> 00:12:00,886
Do we have a deal?

112
00:12:01,763 --> 00:12:05,682
You've got to give before you can receive
in this house, Jill.

113
00:12:08,061 --> 00:12:11,605
My husband John, he had an accomplice.

114
00:12:12,982 --> 00:12:15,275
A person who assisted him
with almost every murder.

115
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:16,777
Look, don't get me wrong.

116
00:12:16,861 --> 00:12:20,948
l'm all ears if you've got something legit
that you want to put on the table.

117
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:25,452
This person will go on killing
until he's stopped.

118
00:12:26,121 --> 00:12:29,665
-You know him and he definitely knows you.
-ls that right?

119
00:12:30,792 --> 00:12:32,459
He's detective Mark Hoffman.

120
00:12:34,337 --> 00:12:36,255
Are you willing to sign a sworn affidavit?

121
00:12:36,965 --> 00:12:38,048
Yes.

122
00:12:38,550 --> 00:12:39,842
You swear to be totally open?

123
00:12:39,926 --> 00:12:42,719
You tell me everything,
no matter how personal or private?

124
00:12:42,804 --> 00:12:43,846
Yes.

125
00:12:44,389 --> 00:12:47,057
l'll give you evidence, whatever you want,

126
00:12:48,017 --> 00:12:51,895
as long as l have your protection,
and complete immunity.

127
00:12:53,231 --> 00:12:54,273
Do we have a deal?

128
00:12:54,357 --> 00:12:56,775
Oh, yeah. Yeah, we have a deal.

129
00:13:34,522 --> 00:13:36,106
Welcome back!

130
00:13:36,191 --> 00:13:39,276
We're live with Bobby Dagen
whose national tour

131
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:42,154
S.U.R.V.l.V.E.
My Story of Overcoming Jigsaw

132
00:13:42,238 --> 00:13:44,364
rolls into town this weekend.

133
00:13:44,949 --> 00:13:47,743
Well, you're quite the national phenomenon
these days, aren't you?

134
00:13:48,369 --> 00:13:50,245
Well, thank you, ma'am.

135
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:53,165
lt's quite flattering how many people
have responded to my story.

136
00:13:53,249 --> 00:13:58,295
And if l can help a few people along the way,
then l'm pleased.

137
00:13:58,379 --> 00:14:02,799
Now, you survived a trap created
by the infamous Jigsaw killer, correct?

138
00:14:03,176 --> 00:14:04,134
Yes, ma'am.

139
00:14:04,219 --> 00:14:07,763
Well, everyone must ask you this question.
What was that like?

140
00:14:10,099 --> 00:14:11,725
Life changing.

141
00:14:11,809 --> 00:14:13,977
lt was something l never anticipated

142
00:14:14,062 --> 00:14:16,688
and, quite honestly, something
that should have killed me.

143
00:14:16,773 --> 00:14:20,442
Tell me more.
Tell me about the actual experience.

144
00:14:20,527 --> 00:14:23,487
l actually have no recollection
of how l got there.

145
00:14:24,072 --> 00:14:26,156
l just remember the feeling

146
00:14:26,241 --> 00:14:28,575
of waking up trapped.

147
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:33,497
And l had to insert two hooks
into my pectoral muscles

148
00:14:33,581 --> 00:14:35,082
and hoist myself up to a platform.

149
00:14:35,166 --> 00:14:36,500
You put the hooks in yourself?

150
00:14:37,085 --> 00:14:38,085
l did.

151
00:14:38,503 --> 00:14:41,505
l pretty much realized
that l couldn't hold on much longer,

152
00:14:42,966 --> 00:14:47,302
and l had to accept the fact
that l was going to die.

153
00:14:47,387 --> 00:14:49,596
And then l saw something,

154
00:14:49,681 --> 00:14:51,223
and what l saw was my life.

155
00:14:52,308 --> 00:14:55,602
lt was a tragedy. l achieved nothing.

156
00:14:57,564 --> 00:15:02,109
And right then,
something inside me started to grow,

157
00:15:03,319 --> 00:15:05,779
something from the bottom of my soul.

158
00:15:06,406 --> 00:15:09,783
And l just... l decided to live.

159
00:15:09,867 --> 00:15:12,786
l found a strength that l thought
had long since expired.

160
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:15,581
And l just yanked, and l yanked!

161
00:15:15,665 --> 00:15:18,875
And when l got to the top,
l just ripped the hooks out of my chest.

162
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:22,754
There was blood everywhere,
and l just screamed.

163
00:15:22,839 --> 00:15:26,425
l just sat there and screamed.

164
00:15:26,509 --> 00:15:29,261
Because l hadn't just survived,

165
00:15:29,345 --> 00:15:31,138
l was reborn.

166
00:15:31,598 --> 00:15:33,181
This was my life.

167
00:15:38,479 --> 00:15:41,481
Wow. Bobby Dagen, everyone.

168
00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:44,610
Bobby's life-changing
experience comes to the...

169
00:15:44,694 --> 00:15:46,361
This is the moment.

170
00:15:46,779 --> 00:15:48,989
-Where's the big kiss?
-l don't know.

171
00:15:49,073 --> 00:15:50,574
Tickets are still available.

172
00:15:50,992 --> 00:15:52,576
And we're out, folks.

173
00:15:53,494 --> 00:15:55,245
-That's not the way it's supposed to be.
-You need to relax.

174
00:15:55,330 --> 00:15:56,830
No, we rehearsed it differently.

175
00:15:59,167 --> 00:16:01,168
lt's okay. Nice work, Bobby.

176
00:16:02,045 --> 00:16:04,171
Ladies, can you excuse us for a minute?

177
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:08,008
Where was the big finish, Bobby?

178
00:16:08,092 --> 00:16:09,635
You tell your story,
you thank your pretty wife,

179
00:16:09,719 --> 00:16:11,011
you bring her out for a big hug and kiss.

180
00:16:11,095 --> 00:16:12,679
l just didn't want to push it, all right?

181
00:16:12,764 --> 00:16:14,556
Okay, but that's the heart of the story.

182
00:16:14,849 --> 00:16:17,017
She was there for your whole recovery.

183
00:16:17,101 --> 00:16:19,770
And without the acknowledgment,
without the kiss,

184
00:16:19,854 --> 00:16:22,189
the audience isn't gonna have any kind
of emotional connection.

185
00:16:22,273 --> 00:16:23,273
l disagree.

186
00:16:23,358 --> 00:16:25,150
Too much emotion,
and it's gonna feel like pandering.

187
00:16:25,234 --> 00:16:27,319
Okay, why don't you let me
do the public relations,

188
00:16:27,403 --> 00:16:28,570
and you do the legal paperwork, okay?

189
00:16:28,655 --> 00:16:31,448
Okay, l get it, Suzanne, all right?
lt's my fault.

190
00:16:31,532 --> 00:16:33,909
lt wasn't your fault, Bobby.

191
00:16:33,993 --> 00:16:35,494
You were fine.

192
00:16:35,578 --> 00:16:37,371
-Just remember your bullet points next time.
-l will.

193
00:16:37,455 --> 00:16:38,789
These interviews are important.

194
00:16:38,873 --> 00:16:40,624
Nina, relax.

195
00:16:40,708 --> 00:16:41,708
Don't worry about them.

196
00:16:42,168 --> 00:16:43,502
You were great.

197
00:16:43,586 --> 00:16:44,836
Yeah?

198
00:16:44,921 --> 00:16:46,922
Your story's real and people feel that.

199
00:16:48,257 --> 00:16:52,844
l know that you get overwhelmed at times,
but we have to keep moving forward, Bobby.

200
00:16:55,056 --> 00:16:57,057
You were meant to do this.

201
00:17:00,937 --> 00:17:03,438
l know. l know, baby.

202
00:17:04,732 --> 00:17:06,483
-Bobby.
-Yeah?

203
00:17:06,567 --> 00:17:08,318
We got the Jigsaw survivor group tomorrow.

204
00:17:08,403 --> 00:17:10,195
Thirty minutes of face time
with other survivors.

205
00:17:10,279 --> 00:17:12,322
Yeah, sounds good.

206
00:17:12,407 --> 00:17:16,118
-Nothing more exciting than that.
-No, not much. Let's go.

207
00:17:58,953 --> 00:18:00,036
Oh, God!

208
00:18:00,538 --> 00:18:02,956
You want to know the only thing wrong
with killing you, Jill?

209
00:18:04,792 --> 00:18:06,251
l can only do it once.

210
00:18:16,262 --> 00:18:17,262
Oh, my God!

211
00:18:28,649 --> 00:18:29,649
No!

212
00:18:56,719 --> 00:18:59,262
Help me! Help me!

213
00:18:59,347 --> 00:19:01,640
Help! Fuck!

214
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:06,269
HeIIo, Evan. I want to pIay a game.

215
00:19:06,354 --> 00:19:10,023
The situation you find yourseIf in
is of your own doing.

216
00:19:10,107 --> 00:19:14,528
You, your girlfriend,
and your friends are aII racists.

217
00:19:16,030 --> 00:19:18,031
Evan, you fuck. You get me out of here!

218
00:19:18,407 --> 00:19:22,285
You have intimidated others
based on their physicaI differences.

219
00:19:22,370 --> 00:19:25,664
But today it is you who wiII run scared.

220
00:19:25,748 --> 00:19:29,876
Your pathetic friends
foIIow your every word, Evan.

221
00:19:29,961 --> 00:19:36,216
Therefore you wiII be the onIy one capabIe
of saving them and yourseIf.

222
00:19:38,261 --> 00:19:42,389
In 30 seconds,
the jacks hoIding up this car wiII faII,

223
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:46,977
setting off a deadIy chain of events.

224
00:19:47,061 --> 00:19:49,229
In order to stop this from happening,

225
00:19:49,313 --> 00:19:54,651
you must tear yourseIf away
from the seat to which you are gIued.

226
00:19:54,735 --> 00:20:00,115
Then you must puII the red Iever before you.
But no act comes without a sacrifice.

227
00:20:00,533 --> 00:20:03,451
You've judged others
by the coIor of their skin,

228
00:20:03,536 --> 00:20:09,916
and today, Evan, you wiII Iearn
that we are all the same color on the inside.

229
00:20:10,334 --> 00:20:13,336
Live or die, Evan, the choice is yours.

230
00:20:17,758 --> 00:20:19,009
No!

231
00:20:25,516 --> 00:20:27,684
-Evan, help!
-l can't.

232
00:20:29,854 --> 00:20:32,480
-Do it. Fuck!
-Fucking do it!

233
00:20:32,565 --> 00:20:34,065
Just fucking do it!

234
00:20:34,150 --> 00:20:36,026
Do it! Do it, man!

235
00:20:36,110 --> 00:20:37,235
Here l go!

236
00:20:43,826 --> 00:20:45,201
Evan!

237
00:20:45,286 --> 00:20:47,162
Baby, get me out of here!

238
00:20:47,246 --> 00:20:50,457
Shit! Fuck! Here l go!

239
00:20:50,541 --> 00:20:52,208
Here l go! Come on!

240
00:20:52,293 --> 00:20:53,543
Fuck me!

241
00:20:58,341 --> 00:20:59,633
Please!

242
00:21:09,602 --> 00:21:12,312
-God!
-Do it! Fucking do it!

243
00:21:12,396 --> 00:21:14,314
-God!
-Do it!

244
00:21:15,191 --> 00:21:17,901
-Evan!
-You got us into this.

245
00:21:17,985 --> 00:21:19,569
Get us the fuck out!

246
00:21:22,448 --> 00:21:23,823
Do it!

247
00:21:27,703 --> 00:21:28,954
You fucking pussy!

248
00:21:41,008 --> 00:21:42,217
Shit.

249
00:22:11,539 --> 00:22:12,998
Every night

250
00:22:14,542 --> 00:22:18,253
l keep thinking that things will get better

251
00:22:19,130 --> 00:22:22,173
the next morning when l wake up.

252
00:22:22,258 --> 00:22:23,717
But it isn't.

253
00:22:24,593 --> 00:22:26,428
Everything l do,

254
00:22:28,639 --> 00:22:31,599
everything l see, l'm surrounded by these

255
00:22:32,893 --> 00:22:34,728
tiny triggers.

256
00:22:35,146 --> 00:22:36,563
They're everywhere,

257
00:22:37,148 --> 00:22:38,982
and they remind me of what l went through,

258
00:22:39,692 --> 00:22:41,401
what Jigsaw did to me.

259
00:22:43,279 --> 00:22:46,322
Sidney, go on, please. You're...

260
00:22:46,407 --> 00:22:48,992
You're in a safe place now.

261
00:22:49,076 --> 00:22:50,577
Tell me what happened next.

262
00:22:52,163 --> 00:22:55,540
Alex! Stop, please! Stop it!

263
00:23:11,474 --> 00:23:12,849
Sidney, look at me.

264
00:23:15,144 --> 00:23:16,811
You made a decision.

265
00:23:17,521 --> 00:23:19,314
How did that make you feel?

266
00:23:19,690 --> 00:23:20,774
Free.

267
00:23:22,777 --> 00:23:24,527
He was abusive.

268
00:23:25,071 --> 00:23:27,781
l tried to stop it before,

269
00:23:28,282 --> 00:23:30,450
but it wasn't until that moment

270
00:23:31,118 --> 00:23:32,827
that l really did something.

271
00:23:33,704 --> 00:23:36,790
lt was him or me, and l chose to live.

272
00:23:36,874 --> 00:23:38,875
lt was the best thing
that ever happened to me.

273
00:23:41,128 --> 00:23:43,630
That's a bunch of bullshit.

274
00:23:44,799 --> 00:23:47,175
He had to die for you to leave him?

275
00:23:49,970 --> 00:23:52,680
You want to know
the best thing that happened to me

276
00:23:52,765 --> 00:23:55,016
after having to cut off my own arm?

277
00:23:59,271 --> 00:24:02,649
lt's handicapped parking at the damn mall!

278
00:24:07,113 --> 00:24:10,156
What the hell is a camera here for anyway?

279
00:24:12,493 --> 00:24:15,745
l am simply here to illustrate the fact
that a traumatic experience,

280
00:24:15,830 --> 00:24:19,332
such as the kind that each one of us
has been forced to endure,

281
00:24:19,416 --> 00:24:22,168
can have a positive outcome. That's all.

282
00:24:22,253 --> 00:24:24,170
Yeah? Like what?

283
00:24:25,506 --> 00:24:29,050
A new perspective on life. Wait, wait, wait.

284
00:24:30,845 --> 00:24:35,056
l know. l understand
that you're not at that place yet.

285
00:24:35,599 --> 00:24:38,309
l understand that and l respect that.

286
00:24:38,394 --> 00:24:40,019
But if you look around at all these people

287
00:24:40,521 --> 00:24:42,397
taking their lives for granted,

288
00:24:43,065 --> 00:24:47,527
eventually they all found something positive
from their experience.

289
00:24:47,611 --> 00:24:50,071
We should never be ashamed
of what we've gone through,

290
00:24:50,156 --> 00:24:52,907
because we are good and we are strong!

291
00:24:55,578 --> 00:24:56,953
You know what?

292
00:24:57,037 --> 00:25:00,707
l'd like everybody to have
a look at something right here.

293
00:25:01,458 --> 00:25:04,085
These are my scars.

294
00:25:06,714 --> 00:25:08,673
Because our minds will heal,

295
00:25:10,176 --> 00:25:11,718
but these scars will never go away.

296
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:15,763
These scars should not be
a symbol of shame.

297
00:25:16,223 --> 00:25:18,141
They should be worn as a badge of courage.

298
00:25:20,603 --> 00:25:21,895
You know, earlier,

299
00:25:21,979 --> 00:25:27,066
l spoke of valuing your loved ones.

300
00:25:28,402 --> 00:25:29,819
But to be perfectly honest,

301
00:25:29,904 --> 00:25:32,864
it's something that l never did
prior to my ordeal.

302
00:25:32,948 --> 00:25:34,490
But since then,

303
00:25:35,242 --> 00:25:39,537
l have found someone
who has truly become my rock.

304
00:25:42,750 --> 00:25:43,750
Joyce, if you could...

305
00:25:45,252 --> 00:25:46,252
Please.

306
00:25:49,256 --> 00:25:51,382
lt's my lovely wife Joyce.

307
00:25:52,635 --> 00:25:55,595
-l love you.
-l love you too, baby.

308
00:26:06,899 --> 00:26:08,233
Bravo.

309
00:26:09,276 --> 00:26:12,278
To be able to sustain
such a traumatic experience,

310
00:26:12,363 --> 00:26:16,658
and yet find the positive in that grizzly act,

311
00:26:17,451 --> 00:26:19,786
it's a remarkable feat indeed.

312
00:26:22,456 --> 00:26:24,332
Remarkable,

313
00:26:25,459 --> 00:26:27,669
if not a little perverse.

314
00:26:29,964 --> 00:26:33,007
l'm sure l speak for everyone
here when l say

315
00:26:33,092 --> 00:26:35,635
how grateful we are

316
00:26:36,262 --> 00:26:41,224
to be part of your promotional DVD.

317
00:26:48,816 --> 00:26:51,025
l appreciate it. Thank you. lt's...

318
00:26:57,992 --> 00:27:00,493
-l can take that, sir.
-Thank you very much.

319
00:27:01,036 --> 00:27:02,328
Joyce, can l borrow him for a second?

320
00:27:02,413 --> 00:27:03,746
Sure. l'll be in the car, okay?

321
00:27:03,831 --> 00:27:04,998
Two minutes behind you.

322
00:27:05,082 --> 00:27:06,332
-Great.
-You'll see her to the car, please, sir?

323
00:27:06,417 --> 00:27:08,251
-Of course.
-Thank you.

324
00:27:09,545 --> 00:27:10,753
What's up?

325
00:27:10,838 --> 00:27:13,339
So what's with the creepy guy with the
cane? Someone l should know about?

326
00:27:13,424 --> 00:27:15,425
No, no, no. He's been at these meetings
longer than l have.

327
00:27:15,509 --> 00:27:16,718
He's fine.

328
00:27:18,012 --> 00:27:19,095
All right.

329
00:27:19,847 --> 00:27:21,764
Listen, get back to the hotel,
and get some rest, all right?

330
00:27:21,849 --> 00:27:23,891
Yeah. Everything's fine.

331
00:27:24,518 --> 00:27:25,601
Great work tonight, Bobby.

332
00:27:25,686 --> 00:27:27,437
-Thank you.
-You're the man.

333
00:27:41,535 --> 00:27:42,702
Joyce?

334
00:27:49,084 --> 00:27:50,418
What happened to him?

335
00:27:52,254 --> 00:27:55,173
They always tell you not to smoke
at the gas station.

336
00:27:55,257 --> 00:27:58,092
-This should wrap up the week for you.
-Great.

337
00:28:03,807 --> 00:28:04,807
What's up, man?

338
00:28:05,601 --> 00:28:07,602
l'm at a junkyard on 58th.

339
00:28:07,811 --> 00:28:08,895
Why?

340
00:28:08,979 --> 00:28:10,521
Call came in about a car crash.

341
00:28:10,606 --> 00:28:12,732
Car crash? Why are you there?

342
00:28:13,442 --> 00:28:14,650
lt's not just a car crash.

343
00:28:14,735 --> 00:28:15,985
lt's a trap.

344
00:28:16,070 --> 00:28:17,695
How many bodies?

345
00:28:18,405 --> 00:28:19,947
Enough pieces to make four.

346
00:28:20,491 --> 00:28:23,034
Okay, get everyone away
from that crime scene till l get there.

347
00:28:23,118 --> 00:28:24,952
-Even Homicide, you got it?
-Yeah.

348
00:28:25,037 --> 00:28:26,537
All right, l'm on the way.

349
00:28:28,832 --> 00:28:32,168
HeIIo, Evan. I want to pIay a game.

350
00:28:32,252 --> 00:28:34,796
The situation you find yourseIf in...

351
00:28:36,423 --> 00:28:38,633
You, your girlfriend...

352
00:28:41,637 --> 00:28:47,225
You have intimidated others
based on their physicaI differences.

353
00:29:04,785 --> 00:29:06,619
So, what do you think?

354
00:29:07,287 --> 00:29:08,329
Why?

355
00:29:08,956 --> 00:29:10,623
Why this display?

356
00:29:11,625 --> 00:29:13,251
Why them? Why now?

357
00:29:13,669 --> 00:29:15,837
You know he likes to put on a show.

358
00:29:16,463 --> 00:29:18,840
Well, there's gotta be something else.

359
00:29:26,807 --> 00:29:29,725
Bag the other bodies. Get them back
to the coroner's office right away.

360
00:29:29,810 --> 00:29:32,061
We'll need them checked
for anything resembling a clue.

361
00:29:32,146 --> 00:29:35,231
Tattoos, piercings, skin cuttings.

362
00:29:35,315 --> 00:29:38,484
lf that man has a cavity in his tooth,
l want to know about it.

363
00:29:38,569 --> 00:29:39,819
-Yes, sir.
-All right.

364
00:29:39,903 --> 00:29:41,154
Gibson.

365
00:29:41,572 --> 00:29:43,030
Yeah?

366
00:29:43,407 --> 00:29:45,074
Hoffman was expecting you.

367
00:29:48,412 --> 00:29:49,829
God damn.

368
00:29:52,791 --> 00:29:53,875
Would you look at that?

369
00:29:55,210 --> 00:29:56,711
Please get forensics in here.

370
00:29:57,171 --> 00:29:58,838
Tell them to haul ass.

371
00:29:59,089 --> 00:30:01,215
This needs to be dusted for prints.

372
00:30:02,134 --> 00:30:03,509
-All right.
-Okay.

373
00:30:38,045 --> 00:30:39,170
Help!

374
00:30:57,689 --> 00:30:58,731
HeIIo, Bobby.

375
00:31:00,442 --> 00:31:01,734
I want to pIay a game.

376
00:31:02,694 --> 00:31:06,322
You have amassed wealth, fame,
and notoriety,

377
00:31:06,406 --> 00:31:09,242
based upon your story of survivaI.

378
00:31:09,326 --> 00:31:14,163
Many have aided in your cause,
but few know the truth.

379
00:31:14,248 --> 00:31:16,332
You are a liar.

380
00:31:16,416 --> 00:31:19,210
You and l both know
you have never been in a trap,

381
00:31:19,294 --> 00:31:21,712
nor have you ever been tested.

382
00:31:23,215 --> 00:31:27,468
Today these Iies wiII come fuII circIe
and you wiII Iearn

383
00:31:27,928 --> 00:31:32,515
if you truIy have what it takes
to caII yourseIf a survivor.

384
00:31:33,517 --> 00:31:35,351
The cage you find yourseIf in

385
00:31:35,435 --> 00:31:37,520
wiII symboIize your rebirth.

386
00:31:40,315 --> 00:31:41,691
Joyce? No!

387
00:31:43,277 --> 00:31:45,945
Joyce! No!

388
00:31:46,029 --> 00:31:47,405
Please, no.

389
00:31:48,115 --> 00:31:49,865
Within the next 60 minutes,

390
00:31:49,950 --> 00:31:52,994
you must stay upon the path of Iearning

391
00:31:53,078 --> 00:31:55,538
and traverse a series of obstacles

392
00:31:55,622 --> 00:31:57,790
to obtain access to your wife,

393
00:31:57,874 --> 00:31:59,834
who you have aIso deceived.

394
00:32:00,043 --> 00:32:03,004
If you faiI to reach her
before the clock runs out,

395
00:32:03,463 --> 00:32:04,839
-she will die.
-No.

396
00:32:05,132 --> 00:32:06,507
Live or die, Bobby?

397
00:32:06,592 --> 00:32:07,967
Make your choice.

398
00:33:21,541 --> 00:33:22,708
Bobby!

399
00:33:24,044 --> 00:33:27,963
Help!

400
00:33:29,383 --> 00:33:31,300
Let me out!

401
00:33:41,395 --> 00:33:42,478
Bobby.

402
00:33:42,562 --> 00:33:46,857
Bobby! What's going on? What's going on?

403
00:33:47,567 --> 00:33:50,236
Another Jigsaw survivor has come forward.

404
00:33:51,196 --> 00:33:53,864
As the city stays crippIed in fear
from the Jigsaw kiIIings,

405
00:33:54,366 --> 00:33:57,576
chiIIing new words from
the Iatest survivor provide a reminder

406
00:33:57,661 --> 00:34:01,247
of the physicaI and mentaI toII
these deadIy games can take.

407
00:34:02,249 --> 00:34:05,918
This horribIe event was happening to me,

408
00:34:06,294 --> 00:34:09,213
and in that moment,

409
00:34:10,257 --> 00:34:12,425
that moment that this thing

410
00:34:13,093 --> 00:34:15,469
threatened to take everything away,

411
00:34:16,054 --> 00:34:17,638
even the pain,

412
00:34:19,891 --> 00:34:23,018
I reaIized what I stiII had Ieft to give.

413
00:34:24,062 --> 00:34:26,105
And I didn't want to Iet that go.

414
00:34:28,150 --> 00:34:29,775
It gave me Iight.

415
00:34:31,528 --> 00:34:35,698
That pure moment
of absoIute horror gave me Iight.

416
00:34:35,782 --> 00:34:38,117
And as wrong as this may seem,

417
00:34:39,453 --> 00:34:41,454
I'm better for enduring it.

418
00:34:42,581 --> 00:34:44,290
I'm stronger.

419
00:34:44,958 --> 00:34:47,543
And, I must admit, I'm gratefuI for it.

420
00:34:48,545 --> 00:34:50,796
I'm gratefuI it happened to me,

421
00:34:51,798 --> 00:34:54,216
and I wish the same for everyone Iike me.

422
00:34:55,135 --> 00:34:57,470
Joan is but one of a growing
number of citizens...

423
00:34:57,596 --> 00:35:01,640
lf something like that doesn't get you
to change your perspective on life,

424
00:35:02,392 --> 00:35:04,059
l don't know what will.

425
00:35:05,353 --> 00:35:06,479
Yeah.

426
00:35:08,565 --> 00:35:11,066
And if those people weren't so fucked up
after their games,

427
00:35:11,151 --> 00:35:13,819
they'd make a mint selling their stories.

428
00:36:19,386 --> 00:36:22,596
That's a real clever design.

429
00:36:24,307 --> 00:36:26,058
Yours or your husband's?

430
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:27,935
-Everything was him.
-Right.

431
00:36:28,019 --> 00:36:29,270
Well, here's my problem,

432
00:36:29,354 --> 00:36:32,898
that was left for me,
and your fingerprints were all over it.

433
00:36:34,276 --> 00:36:35,943
When you told me Hoffman had it in for you,

434
00:36:36,027 --> 00:36:38,863
you didn't mention that
it was because you tried to kill him.

435
00:36:41,825 --> 00:36:43,742
There's a new game going on.

436
00:36:44,244 --> 00:36:45,452
Does that surprise you?

437
00:36:46,496 --> 00:36:49,248
-No.
-No? No?

438
00:36:50,417 --> 00:36:52,668
You're crazy, you know that?

439
00:36:53,420 --> 00:36:55,713
l knew you were crazy
the minute l laid eyes on you.

440
00:36:55,797 --> 00:36:56,964
Crazy.

441
00:36:58,133 --> 00:37:02,094
Okay, this is what we're gonna do, crazy.

442
00:37:03,054 --> 00:37:05,848
Till l catch Mark Hoffman,
this is your new home.

443
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:07,600
Get comfy.

444
00:37:08,602 --> 00:37:10,352
What makes you think he can't find me here?

445
00:37:10,437 --> 00:37:12,521
Jill, it's a safe house.

446
00:37:13,064 --> 00:37:15,107
Safe house. Safe. House.

447
00:37:15,734 --> 00:37:17,026
You get it?

448
00:37:20,238 --> 00:37:24,366
Gibson, this was sent here addressed to Jill.

449
00:37:24,451 --> 00:37:28,120
-Hoffman knows our location.
-God damn it. God damn it!

450
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:30,080
What?

451
00:37:30,916 --> 00:37:33,667
We just had a small explosion here in a car
at the crime scene.

452
00:37:33,752 --> 00:37:34,877
Okay, is anyone hurt?

453
00:37:34,961 --> 00:37:36,295
Holy shit!

454
00:37:44,846 --> 00:37:45,846
Rogers?

455
00:37:45,931 --> 00:37:47,222
Rogers, you okay?

456
00:37:47,307 --> 00:37:48,307
Yeah.

457
00:37:48,391 --> 00:37:50,309
Get out of there.
You get the bomb squad to sweep the yard.

458
00:37:50,393 --> 00:37:52,645
Don't touch anything eIse untiI it's cIean.

459
00:37:53,647 --> 00:37:55,189
-Got it.
-AII right.

460
00:37:56,650 --> 00:37:57,816
Play it.

461
00:38:04,032 --> 00:38:05,157
Hello, Gibson.

462
00:38:06,159 --> 00:38:07,493
Been a Iong time.

463
00:38:07,994 --> 00:38:09,536
What I want is simpIe,

464
00:38:09,621 --> 00:38:11,038
give me JiII Tuck.

465
00:38:11,623 --> 00:38:13,374
You're protecting her despite the fact

466
00:38:13,458 --> 00:38:15,042
that she had direct knowIedge throughout,

467
00:38:16,169 --> 00:38:19,046
which makes her compIicit in every death.

468
00:38:20,006 --> 00:38:21,590
I'II make you a deaI.

469
00:38:21,675 --> 00:38:23,175
Give her to me,

470
00:38:24,427 --> 00:38:26,220
the game stops, and no one eIse dies.

471
00:38:27,347 --> 00:38:30,891
If not, everyone dies and you'II be to bIame.

472
00:38:32,018 --> 00:38:33,936
Make your choice.

473
00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:35,562
The cIock is ticking.

474
00:38:38,525 --> 00:38:40,526
Let's get her down to the holding cell
at the station.

475
00:38:40,986 --> 00:38:43,445
Lock it down.
No one gets in without my authority.

476
00:38:43,530 --> 00:38:44,738
Got it.

477
00:39:03,466 --> 00:39:04,550
Oh, my God.

478
00:39:06,052 --> 00:39:07,052
Oh, God!

479
00:39:07,137 --> 00:39:08,470
No! Please!

480
00:39:09,639 --> 00:39:12,391
No! Please, help! Please!

481
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:14,018
Please, no!

482
00:39:14,102 --> 00:39:15,436
God damn it!

483
00:39:16,438 --> 00:39:18,480
Bobby. Bobby, help me!

484
00:39:18,565 --> 00:39:20,566
You've got to get me out of here.

485
00:39:21,609 --> 00:39:23,485
l can't move, Bobby.

486
00:39:23,862 --> 00:39:25,112
Please, help me!

487
00:39:25,196 --> 00:39:27,072
Okay, okay, okay. Just relax.

488
00:39:32,537 --> 00:39:34,872
Help me! Do something!

489
00:39:37,042 --> 00:39:38,417
Don't leave me.

490
00:39:40,253 --> 00:39:41,503
HeIIo, Bobby.

491
00:39:41,588 --> 00:39:44,757
Before you
is one of your trusted coIIeagues.

492
00:39:44,841 --> 00:39:49,595
She has been your publicist for years,
knowing your Iies

493
00:39:49,679 --> 00:39:52,097
but choosing to speak no eviI.

494
00:39:52,182 --> 00:39:55,184
She has been richly rewarded for her words,

495
00:39:55,268 --> 00:39:59,271
but today she wiII be rewarded
for her silence.

496
00:39:59,856 --> 00:40:02,232
In the X-ray, you wiII see a key,

497
00:40:02,317 --> 00:40:07,154
the key to Nina's survivaI,
which will shut off her device.

498
00:40:07,447 --> 00:40:08,697
But there's a catch.

499
00:40:08,782 --> 00:40:11,867
You have one minute
to puII the fish hook from her stomach,

500
00:40:11,951 --> 00:40:13,494
and unlock her device

501
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:18,040
or eIse the four spikes
wiII penetrate her throat,

502
00:40:18,124 --> 00:40:20,793
-siIencing Nina forever.
-Fuck!

503
00:40:20,877 --> 00:40:23,128
Remember, the spikes wiII aIso advance

504
00:40:23,213 --> 00:40:28,217
each time the decibel level in this room
rises above a whisper,

505
00:40:28,301 --> 00:40:30,135
kiIIing her even sooner.

506
00:40:30,595 --> 00:40:34,348
WiII Nina Iive or die, Bobby?
The choice is yours.

507
00:40:36,309 --> 00:40:39,436
-Help me. Help!
-No! No!

508
00:40:43,483 --> 00:40:44,691
Just shut up.

509
00:40:46,236 --> 00:40:47,820
Stay with me, okay?

510
00:40:53,785 --> 00:40:54,910
Do it.

511
00:41:02,335 --> 00:41:04,378
No. No. No.

512
00:41:05,505 --> 00:41:07,673
Okay, stay with me. Stay with me.

513
00:41:07,757 --> 00:41:09,341
lt's gonna be okay. Look at me.

514
00:41:09,425 --> 00:41:10,467
Look at me.

515
00:41:23,356 --> 00:41:25,816
No! Nina, quiet. Nina.

516
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:27,442
Please. Please, for me.

517
00:41:27,527 --> 00:41:29,194
Just shut the fuck up.

518
00:41:29,279 --> 00:41:31,446
l'm gonna get this out.

519
00:41:45,378 --> 00:41:46,962
No! No!

520
00:41:47,797 --> 00:41:50,966
Just do it, Bobby. Just fucking do it.

521
00:42:18,536 --> 00:42:19,536
Bobby!

522
00:42:37,639 --> 00:42:38,972
No!

523
00:42:41,351 --> 00:42:43,644
Why wouldn't you just shut the fuck up?

524
00:42:45,563 --> 00:42:47,522
You just needed to shut up!

525
00:42:51,236 --> 00:42:54,154
No! Oh, my God!

526
00:42:54,822 --> 00:42:57,658
No! Help!

527
00:43:01,496 --> 00:43:03,914
Help! Help!

528
00:43:36,239 --> 00:43:38,240
Here you are, ma'am. Take care.

529
00:43:39,909 --> 00:43:41,535
Ma'am, your name?

530
00:43:41,619 --> 00:43:44,371
Sara, without an "H."

531
00:43:45,832 --> 00:43:48,542
l just want to say l love your book so much.

532
00:43:49,043 --> 00:43:51,878
l just felt like l could feel everything
that you went through.

533
00:43:52,505 --> 00:43:54,172
l feel like it changed my life.

534
00:43:54,424 --> 00:43:56,091
l appreciate that, ma'am.

535
00:43:57,260 --> 00:43:59,678
l really do. Thank you.

536
00:44:01,014 --> 00:44:02,723
Thank you.

537
00:44:10,565 --> 00:44:11,940
Your name, sir?

538
00:44:12,025 --> 00:44:13,066
John.

539
00:44:14,402 --> 00:44:17,154
With an "H," without an "H,"
it doesn't matter.

540
00:44:17,238 --> 00:44:19,698
We'll go with John with an "H" this time.

541
00:44:19,782 --> 00:44:22,409
You got quite an army working for you here,
don't you?

542
00:44:23,286 --> 00:44:24,953
Must be spreading a pretty good word.

543
00:44:25,038 --> 00:44:28,373
Well, we try to reach as many
people as possible, you know?

544
00:44:28,458 --> 00:44:30,667
You don't see anything wrong with that?

545
00:44:31,044 --> 00:44:33,378
No. No, sir, l don't.

546
00:44:37,216 --> 00:44:38,508
You know,

547
00:44:39,886 --> 00:44:41,553
history is a passion for me.

548
00:44:42,055 --> 00:44:44,806
And in ancient Egypt
if you were speaking under oath,

549
00:44:44,891 --> 00:44:46,308
you were required to say,

550
00:44:46,392 --> 00:44:51,355
"lf l'm lying, take me to the quarries."

551
00:44:53,733 --> 00:44:55,650
That mean anything to you?

552
00:44:55,735 --> 00:44:58,195
No, sir. No, sir, it doesn't.

553
00:44:58,738 --> 00:45:00,655
Well, l'll tell you what it means.

554
00:45:00,740 --> 00:45:04,284
lt means if you knowingly lied
on the public record

555
00:45:05,745 --> 00:45:07,704
that you were subject
to a period of enslavement.

556
00:45:07,789 --> 00:45:09,623
What are you implying here, sir?

557
00:45:09,707 --> 00:45:11,291
l'm not implying anything.

558
00:45:11,876 --> 00:45:14,086
Move along, buddy. He signed your book.

559
00:45:15,838 --> 00:45:17,589
Thanks for the signature.

560
00:45:18,549 --> 00:45:21,093
Nice picture, but l don't need it.

561
00:45:22,095 --> 00:45:23,428
We've met.

562
00:45:36,692 --> 00:45:38,860
Adam, Gibson says he wants
you on these right away.

563
00:45:38,945 --> 00:45:40,112
They're from the junkyard.

564
00:45:45,451 --> 00:45:47,327
Make your choice.

565
00:45:47,787 --> 00:45:49,246
The cIock is ticking.

566
00:45:50,123 --> 00:45:51,123
See that?

567
00:45:52,250 --> 00:45:53,250
Yeah.

568
00:45:54,502 --> 00:45:56,294
l know that from somewhere.

569
00:45:57,255 --> 00:45:59,965
Hey, l've got something over here.

570
00:46:01,717 --> 00:46:04,594
We might know who's in the game.
This was just sent to us.

571
00:46:04,679 --> 00:46:07,681
lt was taken
from a security camera downtown.

572
00:46:07,765 --> 00:46:09,433
The guy's name is Bobby Dagen.

573
00:46:09,517 --> 00:46:10,684
-Familiar?
-No.

574
00:46:10,768 --> 00:46:14,146
He's a Jigsaw survivor
who's milking it on talk shows.

575
00:46:14,564 --> 00:46:17,190
His wife and handlers are also missing.

576
00:46:45,761 --> 00:46:46,970
Joyce?

577
00:46:48,514 --> 00:46:50,182
Who is it? Who's there?

578
00:46:50,850 --> 00:46:52,225
-Suzanne.
-Who is that?

579
00:46:52,310 --> 00:46:54,186
For fuck's sake, Bobby. Bobby.

580
00:46:54,729 --> 00:46:55,979
Bobby, get me out of here.

581
00:46:56,063 --> 00:46:57,314
Bobby, help me.

582
00:46:57,398 --> 00:46:59,483
-ls Cale here?
-Who the fuck knows?

583
00:46:59,567 --> 00:47:02,694
Get this off of me, Bobby! Get this off of me!

584
00:47:08,284 --> 00:47:09,367
HeIIo, Bobby.

585
00:47:09,452 --> 00:47:13,497
That feeIing running
through your body is fear,

586
00:47:13,581 --> 00:47:17,584
the fear of not knowing
if you have what it takes to survive.

587
00:47:17,668 --> 00:47:19,544
Before you is your Iawyer

588
00:47:19,629 --> 00:47:21,171
who swore an oath of ethics,

589
00:47:21,255 --> 00:47:26,218
but chose to see no evil
in order to benefit herself.

590
00:47:26,302 --> 00:47:28,345
Once her device begins to rotate,

591
00:47:28,429 --> 00:47:30,764
it wiII pierce her eyes and mouth

592
00:47:30,848 --> 00:47:34,726
if you don't deIay its movement
for at least 30 seconds.

593
00:47:34,810 --> 00:47:35,852
To do this,

594
00:47:35,937 --> 00:47:40,899
you must step into the other machine
and Iift the bars to the highest position

595
00:47:40,983 --> 00:47:45,570
Iong enough to cIose the circuit,
sIowing down her device.

596
00:47:45,655 --> 00:47:48,740
If you do nothing, she wiII wind to her death

597
00:47:48,824 --> 00:47:50,325
before the clock runs out.

598
00:47:50,701 --> 00:47:52,953
Do you have what it takes to heIp her?

599
00:47:53,287 --> 00:47:54,371
Make your choice.

600
00:47:54,956 --> 00:47:56,248
Bobby, please!

601
00:47:56,332 --> 00:47:58,124
Bobby, please get me out!

602
00:47:58,459 --> 00:47:59,584
Get me the fuck...

603
00:48:01,128 --> 00:48:02,170
Oh, God!

604
00:48:03,548 --> 00:48:05,590
No, no! Bobby, please!

605
00:48:07,176 --> 00:48:08,552
Please, help me!

606
00:48:10,596 --> 00:48:13,098
Oh, God! Oh, God!

607
00:48:13,182 --> 00:48:15,350
Please, hurry! Hurry!

608
00:48:15,893 --> 00:48:19,145
Come on, Bobby, please! Hurry!

609
00:48:19,230 --> 00:48:21,398
Come on! Bobby, come on!

610
00:48:21,649 --> 00:48:25,277
Hurry! Please! Please, hurry!

611
00:48:31,742 --> 00:48:33,451
Bobby, please, hurry!

612
00:48:33,536 --> 00:48:34,578
Hurry!

613
00:48:40,167 --> 00:48:43,211
Yes! Yes, Bobby! Yes!

614
00:48:44,797 --> 00:48:46,047
Come on!

615
00:48:47,091 --> 00:48:48,425
Bobby, no.

616
00:48:56,267 --> 00:48:59,519
No! God, no!

617
00:48:59,604 --> 00:49:01,396
No! Bobby!

618
00:49:01,480 --> 00:49:04,399
Please, no! Bobby, no!

619
00:49:05,109 --> 00:49:07,819
Come on, Bobby. Please!
Get me out of here!

620
00:49:08,404 --> 00:49:09,529
Come on!

621
00:49:10,656 --> 00:49:12,032
Bobby, please!

622
00:49:12,199 --> 00:49:13,199
No!

623
00:49:13,492 --> 00:49:14,534
Oh, God.

624
00:49:14,827 --> 00:49:17,245
Oh, my God. Bobby, stay there.

625
00:49:21,792 --> 00:49:23,710
Bobby, please, no!

626
00:49:24,003 --> 00:49:25,670
No! No!

627
00:49:30,468 --> 00:49:31,509
No!

628
00:49:34,764 --> 00:49:36,514
Please, please!

629
00:49:36,849 --> 00:49:37,807
No!

630
00:49:37,892 --> 00:49:39,184
Oh, God!

631
00:50:25,272 --> 00:50:26,356
Oh, my God.

632
00:50:29,443 --> 00:50:31,361
No. No.

633
00:50:32,571 --> 00:50:33,655
Help!

634
00:50:46,794 --> 00:50:48,503
Do you know this guy?

635
00:50:53,634 --> 00:50:55,051
l've seen him on TV, but l don't know him.

636
00:50:57,680 --> 00:50:58,680
Did your husband?

637
00:50:58,973 --> 00:51:00,265
l don't know.

638
00:51:01,976 --> 00:51:04,102
You sure you don't know him?

639
00:51:06,188 --> 00:51:07,439
Yeah, l'm sure.

640
00:51:08,441 --> 00:51:09,816
All right then.

641
00:51:13,696 --> 00:51:15,071
Lock it up.

642
00:51:15,823 --> 00:51:18,783
Hoffman just sent an e-mail
with an MPEG attachment.

643
00:51:18,868 --> 00:51:21,161
l'm just searching the lP address.

644
00:51:21,245 --> 00:51:22,787
Can you find out where it came from?

645
00:51:22,872 --> 00:51:26,541
lt depends on how many proxy servers
he filtered it through,

646
00:51:26,625 --> 00:51:29,252
but it was time-delayed,
so it'll leave fingerprints.

647
00:51:29,336 --> 00:51:30,378
Play it.

648
00:51:31,964 --> 00:51:33,214
Hello, Gibson.

649
00:51:33,632 --> 00:51:36,259
Once again, we're at a moral crossroad.

650
00:51:37,178 --> 00:51:39,554
I don't bIame you
for not giving me JiII Tuck,

651
00:51:39,930 --> 00:51:42,182
but you shouIdn't Iet an oId grudge
cIoud yourjudgment.

652
00:51:43,809 --> 00:51:45,643
Look to where you're being Ied.

653
00:51:46,228 --> 00:51:48,313
Look beyond the crossroad
to the clear dawn.

654
00:51:50,316 --> 00:51:51,649
Do you see it?

655
00:51:55,654 --> 00:51:57,322
l get it. Let's go.

656
00:52:16,133 --> 00:52:17,175
Joyce?

657
00:52:35,986 --> 00:52:36,945
Cale?

658
00:52:37,029 --> 00:52:38,488
Bobby? Bobby?

659
00:52:38,864 --> 00:52:41,324
Listen to me. Cale.
Cale, l can see you, okay?

660
00:52:41,659 --> 00:52:43,910
-Cale, don't move.
-Bobby, where the hell are you?

661
00:52:44,203 --> 00:52:46,120
-You got to help me, Bobby.
-Do you know where Joyce is?

662
00:52:46,205 --> 00:52:47,622
What the fuck? l can't see, man.

663
00:52:47,706 --> 00:52:48,915
How the fuck would l know where Joyce is?

664
00:52:48,999 --> 00:52:50,124
l'm about to lose my shit!

665
00:52:50,209 --> 00:52:52,085
Do l know where Joyce is?
l'm fucking blind, man.

666
00:52:52,169 --> 00:52:54,212
Okay, Cale. Cale, do not move.

667
00:52:54,713 --> 00:52:56,714
l got this thing around my fucking neck.
l can't fucking breathe.

668
00:52:56,799 --> 00:52:59,050
Don't fucking move.
We're not on the ground floor.

669
00:52:59,134 --> 00:53:00,385
A lot of this floor is missing.

670
00:53:00,469 --> 00:53:02,428
Just don't move, okay?

671
00:53:02,763 --> 00:53:04,514
Fuck. You gotta help me.

672
00:53:05,057 --> 00:53:08,935
Get me fucking down, Bobby! Fuck!
Fuck me!

673
00:53:09,019 --> 00:53:10,270
Cale, there's a tape.

674
00:53:10,354 --> 00:53:12,939
-What fucking tape?
-There's a tape.

675
00:53:13,023 --> 00:53:14,607
Shut up. l'm gonna play the tape.

676
00:53:18,279 --> 00:53:22,866
HeIIo, Bobby.
Across from you is your cIosest friend.

677
00:53:22,950 --> 00:53:28,663
He knows aII your sins,
yet he acts as though he hears no eviI.

678
00:53:28,747 --> 00:53:30,832
Today, what he hears

679
00:53:30,916 --> 00:53:34,335
will be the difference
between life and death.

680
00:53:34,420 --> 00:53:37,672
Bobby, you must heIp
Cale walk over the planks,

681
00:53:37,756 --> 00:53:40,008
and get as cIose to you as possibIe.

682
00:53:40,593 --> 00:53:43,970
Find your own way across
the beams to the key.

683
00:53:44,555 --> 00:53:48,182
You must get it to him over
the Iast span between you.

684
00:53:48,267 --> 00:53:52,854
lf the noose around Cale's neck
is not removed within 60 seconds,

685
00:53:52,938 --> 00:53:57,442
a winch wiII be engaged,
and your secret wiII be Ieft hanging.

686
00:53:57,693 --> 00:54:01,404
Does Cale live or die, Bobby?
The choice is yours.

687
00:54:01,488 --> 00:54:02,780
Bobby!

688
00:54:02,865 --> 00:54:03,948
Oh, God.

689
00:54:04,408 --> 00:54:06,951
Cale. Cale, listen to me.

690
00:54:07,244 --> 00:54:08,369
Listen to me.

691
00:54:08,454 --> 00:54:10,538
Shut the fuck up
and you listen to me for once.

692
00:54:11,081 --> 00:54:13,541
Listen, l'm gonna walk you through this,
okay, buddy?

693
00:54:13,626 --> 00:54:15,209
l'm blind. You fucking come to me.

694
00:54:15,294 --> 00:54:17,295
l'm gonna try to get as close to you
as l can, buddy.

695
00:54:17,379 --> 00:54:19,547
l'm fucking listening to you.
Talk me fucking through this.

696
00:54:19,632 --> 00:54:21,966
l want you to shuffle to your right.

697
00:54:22,134 --> 00:54:24,135
Just shuffle exactly to your right.

698
00:54:24,929 --> 00:54:27,305
You're gonna feel a plank at your foot.
Yes, yes.

699
00:54:27,389 --> 00:54:30,350
Yes, yes, perfect.
l need you to head out on that plank.

700
00:54:30,434 --> 00:54:31,476
-Oh, fuck.
-Yes.

701
00:54:32,686 --> 00:54:34,520
Okay, l got it. l got it. l got it!

702
00:54:36,649 --> 00:54:38,107
Fuck this.

703
00:54:38,442 --> 00:54:40,109
Okay, Cale, l'm on the way.

704
00:54:40,736 --> 00:54:42,987
Fuck. Fuck. Okay, all right.

705
00:54:43,197 --> 00:54:45,323
Now there's gonna be a plank
in front of you.

706
00:54:45,574 --> 00:54:47,033
-Okay.
-You're gonna have to go

707
00:54:47,117 --> 00:54:48,660
about 1 0 degrees to your right.

708
00:54:48,744 --> 00:54:50,203
l got it. l got it.

709
00:54:50,287 --> 00:54:52,580
-Come on, keep fucking talking to me.
-Okay. Okay, Cale.

710
00:54:53,332 --> 00:54:55,208
-Feel where the plank...
-l got it.

711
00:54:55,751 --> 00:54:56,751
Okay.

712
00:54:57,252 --> 00:54:59,837
Oh, God! What the fuck was that, man?

713
00:54:59,922 --> 00:55:02,465
lt's okay, Cale. lt was a bottle.
lt was a bottle.

714
00:55:02,549 --> 00:55:05,259
-What the fuck was that?
-lt's okay. lt was a bottle.

715
00:55:05,344 --> 00:55:07,845
-You're gonna be fine.
-Okay.

716
00:55:08,430 --> 00:55:10,473
Fuck. Okay.

717
00:55:10,557 --> 00:55:11,766
You got it, buddy.

718
00:55:12,184 --> 00:55:14,936
You got it.
Now you're gonna feel a second plank.

719
00:55:15,020 --> 00:55:18,189
-You'll feel it with your foot.
-l got it.

720
00:55:18,399 --> 00:55:19,399
Feel it with your foot.

721
00:55:22,695 --> 00:55:24,153
Get me out of this fucking thing, Bobby.

722
00:55:24,238 --> 00:55:25,738
Step up onto the plank.

723
00:55:28,701 --> 00:55:30,034
Oh, fuck. Oh, God.

724
00:55:30,494 --> 00:55:32,161
Relax. You're okay.

725
00:55:35,833 --> 00:55:37,542
No! No!

726
00:55:38,210 --> 00:55:39,711
Cale, hang on. Cale.

727
00:55:43,090 --> 00:55:50,388
Fuck. Fuck.

728
00:56:04,236 --> 00:56:05,570
Bobby. Bobby.

729
00:56:17,291 --> 00:56:18,958
l got the key but... Cale!

730
00:56:20,127 --> 00:56:21,127
l'm gonna throw you the key.

731
00:56:21,211 --> 00:56:23,379
Cup your hands closer to your chest!

732
00:56:23,464 --> 00:56:25,465
l'm gonna throw it on three, all right?

733
00:56:28,010 --> 00:56:29,469
One,

734
00:56:29,803 --> 00:56:31,262
two,

735
00:56:31,346 --> 00:56:32,346
three.

736
00:56:38,854 --> 00:56:39,896
No.

737
00:56:42,441 --> 00:56:43,900
Oh, fuck me.

738
00:56:48,447 --> 00:56:50,448
No! God damn it, no!

739
00:56:53,285 --> 00:56:54,452
Cale!

740
00:57:01,960 --> 00:57:04,212
No. Cale.

741
00:57:17,643 --> 00:57:18,726
There's nothing here.

742
00:57:18,811 --> 00:57:20,311
Yes, there is.

743
00:57:21,021 --> 00:57:22,438
Right there.

744
00:57:27,820 --> 00:57:29,570
Why would he want us to come here?

745
00:57:29,655 --> 00:57:31,823
For me to remember.

746
00:57:31,907 --> 00:57:34,367
This is where he saved my life.

747
00:57:35,619 --> 00:57:39,247
When l was in uniform
l responded to a distress call here.

748
00:57:39,748 --> 00:57:43,668
Back when this pIace was a flophouse
forjunkies and homeIess peopIe.

749
00:58:01,562 --> 00:58:03,813
Freeze! Don't you fucking move.

750
00:58:05,899 --> 00:58:07,358
Drop the gun.

751
00:58:17,244 --> 00:58:18,286
He didn't know what hit him.

752
00:58:19,580 --> 00:58:24,542
Yeah, he assaulted me,
but it shouldn't have been a death sentence.

753
00:58:31,550 --> 00:58:33,926
Next time, you shoot first.

754
00:58:36,597 --> 00:58:39,515
l had no choice
but to report Hoffman for brutaIity.

755
00:58:39,600 --> 00:58:40,766
You owe me.

756
00:58:45,731 --> 00:58:46,731
What happened?

757
00:58:49,193 --> 00:58:53,446
He got a promotion is what happened.
And l got put on an island.

758
00:58:54,364 --> 00:58:57,033
A year later, l transferred to lA,
busted three of his guys.

759
00:58:57,117 --> 00:59:00,745
He swore he'd get me back, and here we are.

760
00:59:01,413 --> 00:59:05,917
This place was called
Crossroads Manufacturing before it closed.

761
00:59:07,794 --> 00:59:10,004
"Look beyond the crossroads

762
00:59:11,840 --> 00:59:13,591
"to the clear dawn."

763
00:59:14,301 --> 00:59:15,843
l don't follow you.

764
00:59:15,928 --> 00:59:19,555
The man he killed was released from
Clear Dawn Psychiatric Hospital

765
00:59:19,640 --> 00:59:21,474
when the state shut it down.

766
00:59:21,725 --> 00:59:23,267
That building's been abandoned for years.

767
00:59:24,519 --> 00:59:26,354
That's where the game is being played.

768
00:59:26,438 --> 00:59:29,190
All right, you get back,
you stay with Jill Tuck.

769
00:59:29,274 --> 00:59:31,609
Don't let her out of your sight.

770
00:59:50,087 --> 00:59:51,087
Bobby!

771
00:59:53,298 --> 00:59:55,716
-Joyce?
-Bobby. Bobby!

772
00:59:56,760 --> 00:59:58,261
Bobby, I'm here.

773
00:59:59,179 --> 01:00:01,138
-Joyce.
-Bobby, can you hear me?

774
01:00:01,223 --> 01:00:03,057
Joyce, l can hear you. l can see you.

775
01:00:03,141 --> 01:00:04,809
Bobby, I can see you, too.

776
01:00:05,477 --> 01:00:07,061
Yes, baby.

777
01:00:07,688 --> 01:00:10,314
-Get me out of here.
-Baby, I'm on my way.

778
01:00:10,816 --> 01:00:12,566
Who's doing this? Why?

779
01:00:12,651 --> 01:00:15,361
-Why is this happening?
-Please, baby, l'm on the way.

780
01:00:16,071 --> 01:00:18,864
-Just hang on, okay?
-Hurry. Please hurry.

781
01:00:19,241 --> 01:00:21,659
There's got to be a tape.

782
01:00:22,703 --> 01:00:23,703
HeIIo, Bobby.

783
01:00:24,705 --> 01:00:27,581
Before you is the door
that Ieads to your wife.

784
01:00:27,666 --> 01:00:31,002
However, you must first make a choice.

785
01:00:31,086 --> 01:00:35,673
As you may have guessed, your decision
wiII be as difficuIt as puIIing teeth.

786
01:00:37,301 --> 01:00:41,637
The Iock before you requires
a four-digit combination to open.

787
01:00:41,722 --> 01:00:44,807
However, if it is access you seek

788
01:00:45,642 --> 01:00:48,394
then a true sacrifice will have to be made.

789
01:00:50,022 --> 01:00:51,689
Watch and Iearn, Bobby.

790
01:00:56,111 --> 01:01:00,531
The necessary numbers have been etched
onto two of your teeth.

791
01:01:02,242 --> 01:01:05,745
Look to the chart as a reference
for which teeth to puII

792
01:01:05,829 --> 01:01:08,748
and in which order to enter the digits.

793
01:01:10,250 --> 01:01:12,126
Time is ticking down.

794
01:01:12,544 --> 01:01:14,170
You must make your decision quickIy.

795
01:01:19,176 --> 01:01:20,343
Bobby!

796
01:01:21,553 --> 01:01:24,638
l don't want you to see this, baby, okay?

797
01:01:24,723 --> 01:01:26,140
Oh, my God.

798
01:01:29,019 --> 01:01:30,269
No.

799
01:01:32,731 --> 01:01:33,773
No!

800
01:01:35,067 --> 01:01:36,400
Left side clear.

801
01:01:37,694 --> 01:01:38,694
Clear.

802
01:01:40,238 --> 01:01:41,238
-Clear.
-Clear.

803
01:01:41,823 --> 01:01:42,823
Change your position.

804
01:01:44,743 --> 01:01:46,160
The game's still on.

805
01:01:56,505 --> 01:01:58,422
-Let's go.
-Move to the second level.

806
01:02:06,098 --> 01:02:07,431
-Clear.
-Clear.

807
01:02:08,767 --> 01:02:09,934
Clear.

808
01:02:10,268 --> 01:02:11,310
Go.

809
01:02:27,202 --> 01:02:29,120
-Clear up.
-All clear.

810
01:02:29,287 --> 01:02:30,413
Move, move.

811
01:02:32,791 --> 01:02:34,458
-Moving in.
-Moving in.

812
01:02:34,793 --> 01:02:36,544
-Clear.
-We're clear.

813
01:02:44,469 --> 01:02:46,137
Block it off.

814
01:02:47,389 --> 01:02:49,473
-What?
-l found where that MPEG came from.

815
01:02:49,558 --> 01:02:51,725
-Where?
-A business called Pete's Auto Body

816
01:02:51,810 --> 01:02:53,102
on 58th Street.

817
01:02:53,186 --> 01:02:55,729
-The junkyard.
-The location of the car trap?

818
01:02:55,814 --> 01:02:57,314
Yeah, that's correct.

819
01:02:59,985 --> 01:03:01,277
Okay, you guys keep moving.

820
01:03:01,361 --> 01:03:02,736
Where are you going?

821
01:03:03,238 --> 01:03:04,238
To get Hoffman.

822
01:03:04,322 --> 01:03:06,198
Okay, let's move it.

823
01:03:12,998 --> 01:03:14,165
Rogers.

824
01:03:18,837 --> 01:03:19,920
Yeah.

825
01:03:20,630 --> 01:03:23,048
What? What happened?

826
01:03:24,301 --> 01:03:26,010
Gibson's got Hoffman's location.

827
01:03:27,888 --> 01:03:29,430
The game isn't over.

828
01:03:43,695 --> 01:03:45,154
Another body.

829
01:03:47,866 --> 01:03:48,949
Hold.

830
01:03:52,996 --> 01:03:54,163
We got a live one.

831
01:04:10,514 --> 01:04:13,349
Can't cross here. Let's go.

832
01:04:59,104 --> 01:05:01,480
Hey. Go get your shotguns.
You come follow me.

833
01:05:19,457 --> 01:05:20,457
Give me your gun.

834
01:05:42,564 --> 01:05:44,732
Hoffman, freeze.

835
01:05:44,816 --> 01:05:47,359
l want you to slowly put your hands
in the air.

836
01:05:56,161 --> 01:05:57,411
Joyce.

837
01:05:57,495 --> 01:05:58,495
Bobby.

838
01:05:59,122 --> 01:06:01,206
Bobby, l knew you'd make it.

839
01:06:02,834 --> 01:06:03,959
l knew you'd find me.

840
01:06:04,044 --> 01:06:05,294
l am so sorry.

841
01:06:05,378 --> 01:06:07,004
l knew you could do it.

842
01:06:07,672 --> 01:06:09,006
l knew you'd come.

843
01:06:09,341 --> 01:06:10,341
Get me out.

844
01:06:14,429 --> 01:06:15,679
Bobby. Oh, my God.

845
01:06:16,598 --> 01:06:18,015
There's gotta be another way.

846
01:06:22,354 --> 01:06:26,190
HeIIo, Bobby.
You have aImost compIeted your rebirth.

847
01:06:26,274 --> 01:06:30,653
However, your finaI task
wiII be your most difficuIt.

848
01:06:30,737 --> 01:06:34,156
The woman before you
symboIizes your success.

849
01:06:34,240 --> 01:06:35,699
She is your trophy.

850
01:06:35,784 --> 01:06:38,452
And she has seen the good
in your message,

851
01:06:38,536 --> 01:06:40,704
despite its dishonest beginnings.

852
01:06:40,789 --> 01:06:42,206
What's he talking about?

853
01:06:42,290 --> 01:06:46,418
Today, we wiII see
if you can truIy earn her Iove.

854
01:06:48,129 --> 01:06:50,589
To prove your status as a survivor,

855
01:06:50,674 --> 01:06:55,052
you must overcome a game
that should be all too familiar.

856
01:06:56,096 --> 01:06:58,597
-No.
-You supposedIy survived it once aIready,

857
01:06:58,682 --> 01:07:02,601
so it shouId be easy to survive once again.

858
01:07:03,311 --> 01:07:05,813
Pierce the hooks
through your chest muscIes,

859
01:07:05,897 --> 01:07:07,398
and the game wiII begin.

860
01:07:07,482 --> 01:07:12,528
In order to free yourseIf and your wife,
you must hoist yourseIf with these chains,

861
01:07:13,363 --> 01:07:18,492
and connect the extension cords above you
before the cIock expires.

862
01:07:21,663 --> 01:07:24,623
Both hands will be needed
to compIete this task.

863
01:07:24,708 --> 01:07:26,583
But that shouId be simpIe.

864
01:07:26,668 --> 01:07:29,461
For, as you cIaim to understand,

865
01:07:29,838 --> 01:07:33,132
the pectoraI muscIes
can easiIy support your weight.

866
01:07:33,675 --> 01:07:34,967
So l ask you, Bobby,

867
01:07:35,051 --> 01:07:38,303
when you embrace every day
as if it is your Iast,

868
01:07:38,888 --> 01:07:40,931
wiII it be with your wife?

869
01:07:41,933 --> 01:07:43,559
Make your choice.

870
01:07:45,061 --> 01:07:46,478
What's he talking about?

871
01:07:47,021 --> 01:07:48,313
Baby, l'm so sorry.

872
01:07:50,859 --> 01:07:51,859
l lied.

873
01:07:54,154 --> 01:07:55,863
l was never in a trap.

874
01:08:02,078 --> 01:08:03,245
Clear.

875
01:08:27,604 --> 01:08:29,646
How could you let me believe that?

876
01:08:30,148 --> 01:08:31,982
l'm gonna make this right.

877
01:08:32,692 --> 01:08:34,902
You don't deserve to be there.

878
01:08:37,655 --> 01:08:39,072
l'm your wife.

879
01:08:39,783 --> 01:08:41,658
How could you lie to me?

880
01:08:51,127 --> 01:08:52,377
l know that from somewhere.

881
01:08:53,713 --> 01:08:55,839
Make your choice. Clock's ticking.

882
01:09:06,351 --> 01:09:09,436
Bag the other bodies. Get them back
to the coroner's office right away.

883
01:09:11,564 --> 01:09:12,689
What is this, sir?

884
01:09:12,774 --> 01:09:16,443
Hoffman tapped
into the station's security system.

885
01:09:16,528 --> 01:09:18,362
He's been watching us the whole time.

886
01:09:47,934 --> 01:09:49,560
Oh, my God.

887
01:09:56,067 --> 01:09:57,234
-This is Palmer.
-Listen.

888
01:09:57,318 --> 01:09:59,403
You get every available officer
back to the station.

889
01:09:59,487 --> 01:10:00,487
l'm sorry, sir?

890
01:10:00,572 --> 01:10:01,905
Right now.

891
01:10:03,241 --> 01:10:04,283
Sir.

892
01:10:21,426 --> 01:10:24,469
Gibson, are you still there? Gibson.

893
01:11:17,357 --> 01:11:18,941
-Door's locked!
-We're locked in!

894
01:11:22,403 --> 01:11:23,445
Gas! Gas!

895
01:11:23,821 --> 01:11:24,863
Look for an exit.

896
01:11:46,344 --> 01:11:47,844
l love you, Joyce.

897
01:11:49,847 --> 01:11:51,682

01:11:52,058 --> 01:11:54,643
l love you. l love you.

899
01:11:54,727 --> 01:11:56,395
Bobby, l love you.

900
01:12:01,734 --> 01:12:03,527
No! Oh, my God.

901
01:12:05,571 --> 01:12:13,120
No.

902
01:12:19,002 --> 01:12:20,210
Gibson.

903
01:12:33,725 --> 01:12:35,642
You can do it. You can do it.

904
01:12:40,940 --> 01:12:41,940
Oh, my God.

905
01:12:48,197 --> 01:12:49,823
Bobby, l love you.

906
01:13:06,090 --> 01:13:07,424
You can do it.

907
01:13:11,220 --> 01:13:13,430
Hang on. Hang on. Hang on.

908
01:13:14,849 --> 01:13:17,267
Pull. Pull, Bobby. l know you can do it.

909
01:13:17,935 --> 01:13:19,019
Pull.

910
01:13:20,772 --> 01:13:22,564
Oh, my God. Keep going.

911
01:13:22,648 --> 01:13:25,525
Bobby, you can do it. Oh, my God.

912
01:13:25,610 --> 01:13:26,777
Bobby!

913
01:13:27,945 --> 01:13:29,112
Pull!

914
01:13:53,471 --> 01:13:54,471
What was that?

915
01:13:54,806 --> 01:13:57,140
That's it, pull. Pull!

916
01:13:59,143 --> 01:14:00,268

Pull. You're almost there.

919
01:14:12,115 --> 01:14:13,532
Fight, Bobby. You can do it.

920
01:14:15,409 --> 01:14:16,576
Someone's out there.

921
01:14:24,877 --> 01:14:26,503
Oh, my God. No!

922
01:14:26,671 --> 01:14:28,964
Help me! Help me!

923
01:14:30,591 --> 01:14:32,592
Help me! No!

924
01:14:42,019 --> 01:14:43,228
l've been looking for you.

925
01:15:06,002 --> 01:15:07,043
How do l look?

926
01:15:14,760 --> 01:15:15,927
Bitch.

927
01:15:18,306 --> 01:15:19,890
Help me!

928
01:15:23,561 --> 01:15:25,228
Bobby, please, reach.

929
01:15:26,731 --> 01:15:27,731
Go.

930
01:15:29,066 --> 01:15:30,400
Bobby, reach.

931
01:15:31,652 --> 01:15:32,652
Hurry.

932
01:15:33,070 --> 01:15:34,821
Reach. Reach!

933
01:15:34,906 --> 01:15:36,406
You can do it, Bobby.

934
01:15:50,254 --> 01:15:51,504
Bobby, reach. Reach.

935
01:15:53,257 --> 01:15:56,426
One more. Reach. You can do it. Bobby!

936
01:15:56,510 --> 01:15:58,011
Bobby, you can do it.

937
01:16:05,478 --> 01:16:06,478
Bobby!

938
01:17:11,002 --> 01:17:12,002
No!

939
01:17:14,213 --> 01:17:15,505
Bobby!

940
01:17:19,927 --> 01:17:22,012
No. Bobby!

941
01:17:23,597 --> 01:17:24,764
Joyce!

942
01:17:28,352 --> 01:17:29,519
Bobby!

943
01:17:30,896 --> 01:17:31,938
Joyce!

944
01:17:32,023 --> 01:17:33,440
Bobby! Bobby!

945
01:17:38,195 --> 01:17:40,697
Joyce! Joyce!

946
01:17:43,993 --> 01:17:45,118
Bobby!

947
01:17:57,840 --> 01:18:01,634
You fucking cunt.

948
01:18:07,767 --> 01:18:09,267
No! Bobby!

949
01:18:16,150 --> 01:18:17,233
Joyce!

950
01:18:19,403 --> 01:18:20,403
No!

951
01:18:32,416 --> 01:18:33,583
Bobby!

952
01:18:44,720 --> 01:18:45,970
Joyce!

953
01:20:10,055 --> 01:20:11,389
Game over.

954
01:20:29,200 --> 01:20:30,533
Over the last two hours,

955
01:20:30,618 --> 01:20:33,786
it seems our entire city
has been shaken to its core.

956
01:20:33,871 --> 01:20:36,664
In addition to the nine poIice
empIoyees kiIIed tonight,

957
01:20:36,749 --> 01:20:40,293
Jill Tuck, the wife of serial killer
John Kramer, has been found dead.

958
01:20:40,669 --> 01:20:43,755
Citizens are being advised
to report any activity,

959
01:20:43,839 --> 01:20:46,216
even remoteIy suspicious, at this time,

960
01:20:46,300 --> 01:20:49,052
as bIockades are being set up
at major intersections

961
01:20:49,136 --> 01:20:50,762
within a 30-mile radius,

962
01:20:50,846 --> 01:20:54,140
surrounding what wiII be considered
the Iargest attack

963
01:20:54,225 --> 01:20:56,976
on this city's poIice department
in our history.

964
01:20:57,478 --> 01:21:01,189
Any citizens with information
Ieading to the apprehension...

965
01:21:34,765 --> 01:21:36,266
What the fuck?

966
01:21:54,285 --> 01:21:56,119
Hello, Dr. Gordon.

967
01:21:57,413 --> 01:21:59,998
You are perhaps my greatest asset.

968
01:22:14,221 --> 01:22:17,682
Congratulations, Dr. Gordon. You survived.

969
01:22:31,739 --> 01:22:37,994
Without you, my work over the Iast few years
wouId not have been possibIe.

970
01:22:46,337 --> 01:22:47,587
Jeff's wife.

971
01:22:48,297 --> 01:22:49,672
Dr. Lynn Denlon.

972
01:22:54,345 --> 01:22:55,470
She'll be perfect.

973
01:23:02,603 --> 01:23:04,395
My eyes! l can't see!

974
01:23:20,704 --> 01:23:22,789
That having been said, I have a request.

975
01:23:22,873 --> 01:23:24,374
Watch over Jill.

976
01:23:25,793 --> 01:23:31,339
And shouId anything happen to her,
I want you to act immediateIy on my behaIf.

977
01:23:31,882 --> 01:23:36,594
In return for that,
I wiII keep no more secrets from you.

978
01:23:39,056 --> 01:23:41,015
I've shown you a Iot of pIaces.

979
01:23:43,185 --> 01:23:47,188
But there is one that wiII be, perhaps,
the most meaningfuI to you.

980
01:24:27,604 --> 01:24:28,813
l don't think so.

981
01:24:40,534 --> 01:24:41,659
What do you think you're doing?

982
01:24:43,954 --> 01:24:46,038
What the fuck do you think you're doing?

983
01:24:56,383 --> 01:24:57,425
No!

984
01:24:58,719 --> 01:25:00,178
You can't fucking do this to me.

985
01:25:01,054 --> 01:25:03,055
Fuck you. No!

986
01:25:03,140 --> 01:25:04,223
Game over.

987
01:25:04,308 --> 01:25:05,516
No!
