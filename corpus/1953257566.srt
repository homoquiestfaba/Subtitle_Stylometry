1
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:01,100
<i>Mom?</i>

2
00:01:02,228 --> 00:01:03,901
Dinner!

3
00:01:09,235 --> 00:01:10,578
Do you--?

4
00:01:13,706 --> 00:01:15,777
Dinnertime!

5
00:01:21,314 --> 00:01:22,691
Do you--?

6
00:01:36,796 --> 00:01:38,673
<i>Mom?)</i>

7
00:01:39,766 --> 00:01:41,302
Ma?

8
00:01:53,346 --> 00:01:54,825
She's dead!

9
00:01:55,014 --> 00:01:56,618
She's dead!

10
00:01:56,816 --> 00:02:00,195
She's dead!

11
00:02:00,386 --> 00:02:02,093
Somebody help me!

12
00:02:02,589 --> 00:02:05,661
Somebody help me!

13
00:02:05,859 --> 00:02:08,430
Mom!

14
00:02:08,628 --> 00:02:10,335
Somebody help me!

15
00:02:21,808 --> 00:02:22,809
Late. I'm sorry.

16
00:02:23,009 --> 00:02:25,683
- Davis forgot his homework?
- Oh, that'll be the day.

17
00:02:25,879 --> 00:02:27,984
- Mollie?
- Yes, we're halfway to school...

18
00:02:28,181 --> 00:02:31,719
...and she says, "Mom, I'm supposed
to take food for the homeless."

19
00:02:31,918 --> 00:02:34,797
I have to tum around, go to the shore,
then find her.

20
00:02:34,988 --> 00:02:38,231
- Is this the rack we're working on?
- Yep.

21
00:02:42,095 --> 00:02:44,666
This is gorgeous.

22
00:02:44,864 --> 00:02:47,470
Oh, this would be beautiful
with my dress.

23
00:02:47,667 --> 00:02:51,581
- Oh, for the anniversary party?
- I looked it up. Number 20 is china.

24
00:02:51,771 --> 00:02:53,751
How about 21?
Is it beautiful scan/es?

25
00:02:55,408 --> 00:02:56,910
Why wait a year?

26
00:02:59,412 --> 00:03:01,153
Happy anniversary.

27
00:03:01,347 --> 00:03:02,382
Madeleine.

28
00:03:06,986 --> 00:03:08,624
Hello.

29
00:03:09,022 --> 00:03:11,002
This is Billie Clark.

30
00:03:12,659 --> 00:03:14,104
Pardon?

31
00:03:26,673 --> 00:03:28,209
- Hi, Dad.
- Hey, Moll.

32
00:03:28,408 --> 00:03:29,443
- Rick?
- Honey?

33
00:03:29,642 --> 00:03:33,283
Oh, thank God. It's gonna take me
at least five hours to drive there.

34
00:03:33,479 --> 00:03:35,015
I didn't have time to cook--

35
00:03:35,215 --> 00:03:37,593
It's okay.
You sure you don't want us to come?

36
00:03:37,784 --> 00:03:39,559
- Mollie's got--
- Ballet on Tuesday.

37
00:03:39,752 --> 00:03:41,629
Soccer on Thursday,
game on Saturday.

38
00:03:41,821 --> 00:03:43,858
- She's just gonna--
- I cannot miss them.

39
00:03:44,057 --> 00:03:46,264
Mollie, we'll figure it out.

40
00:03:47,227 --> 00:03:49,468
When was the last time
I even saw my mother?

41
00:03:49,662 --> 00:03:51,369
- Doesn't matter.
- Three years ago.

42
00:03:51,564 --> 00:03:53,407
It doesn't matter.

43
00:03:55,768 --> 00:03:56,769
It's okay.

44
00:03:56,970 --> 00:03:58,711
- I love you.
- Love you.

45
00:03:58,905 --> 00:04:00,782
I'm gonna miss you.

46
00:04:01,874 --> 00:04:03,717
Be good, all right?

47
00:04:04,444 --> 00:04:05,923
Bye.

48
00:04:49,389 --> 00:04:50,663
- Aunt Will.
- My girl.

49
00:04:50,857 --> 00:04:53,201
My dear girl.

50
00:04:53,893 --> 00:04:55,236
How is she?

51
00:04:55,428 --> 00:04:58,875
Well, she's just sleeping now.

52
00:04:59,065 --> 00:05:01,272
She sleeps most of the time.

53
00:05:01,968 --> 00:05:03,641
It was a massive coronary.

54
00:05:03,836 --> 00:05:06,476
That's the word the doctor used:
massive.

55
00:05:09,776 --> 00:05:11,619
Are you going to stay at the house?

56
00:05:11,811 --> 00:05:13,791
Is Baby there?

57
00:05:14,247 --> 00:05:15,624
Yeah.

58
00:05:15,815 --> 00:05:17,795
She found your mother.

59
00:05:17,984 --> 00:05:20,430
She thought she had passed
already.

60
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:23,157
So now she's in her room
and she won't come out.

61
00:05:46,045 --> 00:05:47,786
Billie?

62
00:05:49,115 --> 00:05:50,617
Mom.

63
00:05:52,251 --> 00:05:53,559
How you feeling?

64
00:05:57,090 --> 00:05:59,036
Did the children come?

65
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:02,606
No. They...

66
00:06:03,329 --> 00:06:04,899
Oh, that's too bad.

67
00:06:05,098 --> 00:06:08,443
I haven't seen them for so long.

68
00:06:09,001 --> 00:06:10,878
I'm sorry.

69
00:06:14,273 --> 00:06:16,776
Have you seen Baby?

70
00:06:16,976 --> 00:06:19,650
No. Mom, just-- You should rest.

71
00:06:19,846 --> 00:06:21,621
You should rest now, okay?

72
00:06:21,814 --> 00:06:23,350
I can't.

73
00:06:24,350 --> 00:06:26,125
I can't.

74
00:06:26,486 --> 00:06:31,128
Not until I know
that you're gonna take care of Baby.

75
00:06:31,324 --> 00:06:32,530
Mom...

76
00:06:33,126 --> 00:06:34,969
...we never even got along.

77
00:06:35,161 --> 00:06:37,163
Yes, you did.

78
00:06:38,097 --> 00:06:40,338
Before she got sick.

79
00:06:40,533 --> 00:06:42,638
You just don't remember.

80
00:06:42,835 --> 00:06:45,441
I remember everything.

81
00:06:47,407 --> 00:06:49,978
She's your little sister.

82
00:06:51,778 --> 00:06:53,724
Please.

83
00:07:08,161 --> 00:07:10,698
Honey, it is so late.

84
00:07:11,597 --> 00:07:14,271
- You go home now.
- But what about the--?

85
00:07:14,467 --> 00:07:17,778
I'll take care
of all the funeral arrangements.

86
00:07:18,838 --> 00:07:21,751
- You go home to Rick and the kids.
- Thank you.

87
00:07:23,609 --> 00:07:25,179
Thank you.

88
00:07:39,225 --> 00:07:42,502
It's not like I had that much
to do with her, you know?

89
00:07:43,663 --> 00:07:47,201
I mean, how many times
did I even see her since I left?

90
00:07:48,367 --> 00:07:50,347
I used to think...

91
00:07:50,536 --> 00:07:55,144
...when she dies, you know
I won't feel anything.

92
00:07:57,677 --> 00:07:59,554
But I feel...

93
00:08:02,014 --> 00:08:04,858
She was my mother, you know?

94
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:13,368
And you know what she did...

95
00:08:13,559 --> 00:08:15,800
...right before she died?

96
00:08:16,362 --> 00:08:18,171
She asked.

97
00:08:20,766 --> 00:08:23,804
I mean, for a minute, I thought...

98
00:08:24,003 --> 00:08:26,506
...maybe this time will be different.

99
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:29,342
She's happy to see me...

100
00:08:29,542 --> 00:08:32,216
...and she's holding my hand and...

101
00:08:32,845 --> 00:08:34,791
Maybe she'll just...

102
00:08:35,815 --> 00:08:38,318
...tell me that she loves me.

103
00:08:41,487 --> 00:08:44,195
And then that moment was passed.

104
00:08:46,792 --> 00:08:50,296
I mean, it's not like I'm surprised.

105
00:08:50,496 --> 00:08:53,909
She's been asking me the same thing
since I was 18, so...

106
00:08:54,734 --> 00:08:56,645
And what did you say?

107
00:08:59,805 --> 00:09:02,376
What was I supposed to say?

108
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:05,188
Yeah.

109
00:09:07,313 --> 00:09:09,725
Baby is family.

110
00:09:10,516 --> 00:09:12,427
And there's no one else.

111
00:09:12,618 --> 00:09:14,188
Is there?

112
00:09:34,941 --> 00:09:36,443
Hey, Moll.

113
00:09:36,842 --> 00:09:39,186
Slow and quiet, okay?

114
00:10:06,205 --> 00:10:07,809
How is she?

115
00:10:09,175 --> 00:10:12,213
Sorry that she couldn't go
to the funeral.

116
00:10:12,411 --> 00:10:13,981
Should I go up?

117
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:17,286
I think it's better
if we leave her for now.

118
00:10:20,219 --> 00:10:22,392
Did you tell the kids?

119
00:10:22,588 --> 00:10:24,727
They don't like it.

120
00:10:25,925 --> 00:10:26,995
I don't like it.

121
00:10:41,774 --> 00:10:42,809
Baby.

122
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:49,690
You remember Rick?

123
00:10:49,882 --> 00:10:51,259
Hello, Baby.

124
00:10:51,450 --> 00:10:53,862
We're all so sorry
about your mother.

125
00:10:56,122 --> 00:10:58,159
And Davis.

126
00:10:58,357 --> 00:11:00,894
And Mollie, all grown up.

127
00:11:04,997 --> 00:11:06,567
Well...

128
00:11:06,766 --> 00:11:09,804
...I'll see you all up at the ranch
as usual.

129
00:11:10,403 --> 00:11:11,677
With Baby.

130
00:11:11,871 --> 00:11:14,351
- You'll come too.
- You remember the ranch, Baby?

131
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:16,918
You used to love it
when you were little.

132
00:11:17,843 --> 00:11:19,413
<i>Yeah.</i>

133
00:11:20,012 --> 00:11:22,686
Look, Baby,
let me give you a hand with your-

134
00:11:26,986 --> 00:11:28,522
<i>It's okay.</i>

135
00:11:28,721 --> 00:11:30,928
Give me a hug, Baby.

136
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:03,833
Davis, give me a hand
with the luggage.

137
00:12:07,393 --> 00:12:09,100
- Mollie, you want the ken?
- Yeah.

138
00:12:09,295 --> 00:12:10,968
Here you go, honey.

139
00:12:11,330 --> 00:12:13,901
All right. Come on, Baby.

140
00:12:21,073 --> 00:12:23,178
What I really wanna show you
is the view.

141
00:12:23,375 --> 00:12:25,252
Wait till you see it.

142
00:12:25,778 --> 00:12:28,384
Isn't it amazing?

143
00:12:28,714 --> 00:12:31,558
We have swans and ducks.

144
00:12:37,890 --> 00:12:41,269
You're tired.
I'll show you your room.

145
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:44,930
So this room used to be Rick's office.
He totally redid it for you.

146
00:12:45,131 --> 00:12:46,735
Here it is.

147
00:12:48,901 --> 00:12:52,178
I tried to make it look like your room
at Mom's.

148
00:12:54,907 --> 00:12:56,477
- I could help you unpack.
- No.

149
00:12:57,343 --> 00:12:58,788
Okay.

150
00:13:01,714 --> 00:13:03,318
Oh, your pills.

151
00:13:04,784 --> 00:13:07,264
Three? And you know
when to take them and--?

152
00:13:10,289 --> 00:13:12,428
Sony. Of course you do.

153
00:13:20,499 --> 00:13:24,504
We don't smoke in the house,
but on the porch is fine.

154
00:13:30,609 --> 00:13:32,953
Well, I'll call you for dinner.

155
00:13:42,221 --> 00:13:44,030
That's fine.

156
00:13:44,223 --> 00:13:45,361
Thank you. Thanks.

157
00:14:01,173 --> 00:14:03,084
Okay.

158
00:14:04,677 --> 00:14:06,588
Here we go. Just help yourself.

159
00:14:06,779 --> 00:14:08,019
That's wonderful, honey.

160
00:14:08,214 --> 00:14:10,285
Baby, would you like to have a--?

161
00:14:14,553 --> 00:14:20,196
<i>Two roads diverged in a wood, and I--
I took the one less traveled</i>

162
00:14:22,261 --> 00:14:26,073
Well, maybe we should all say grace.
My family did. Look at me.

163
00:14:26,265 --> 00:14:28,609
It's not a prayer. It's a poem.

164
00:14:32,071 --> 00:14:36,417
<i>Two roads diverged in a wood, and I--
I took the one less traveled by</i>

165
00:14:36,609 --> 00:14:38,555
<i>And that has made
All the difference</i>

166
00:14:42,114 --> 00:14:45,789
It's about Mom. I know you don't
wanna talk about Mom, but I do.

167
00:14:45,985 --> 00:14:47,487
No.

168
00:14:49,054 --> 00:14:53,503
Ever wonder what her life would have
been like if she took the other road?

169
00:14:53,926 --> 00:14:57,533
They had money. She could've put me
in an asylum, but she didn't.

170
00:14:57,730 --> 00:14:59,903
And I think that was a mistake.

171
00:15:00,099 --> 00:15:03,046
Because she could have made
something of her life.

172
00:15:03,235 --> 00:15:04,908
She was very talented.

173
00:15:05,104 --> 00:15:09,348
Did you know that she fixed everything
in the house after Dad left us?

174
00:15:09,541 --> 00:15:11,578
- No.
- She did. She fixed the toilet.

175
00:15:11,777 --> 00:15:15,156
She fixed the doorbell
and the door in the kitchen.

176
00:15:15,347 --> 00:15:18,226
She couldn't fix the TV though.

177
00:15:18,417 --> 00:15:22,263
She had to have someone else
come in and fix the TV.

178
00:15:24,123 --> 00:15:25,466
<i>-Okay.-
-Okay.-</i>

179
00:15:25,658 --> 00:15:26,659
I found her.

180
00:15:29,261 --> 00:15:31,366
I think she had a stroke.

181
00:15:32,564 --> 00:15:35,044
Her eyes were wide open.
She was looking up.

182
00:15:35,234 --> 00:15:38,374
I thought maybe she was looking
at the slats...

183
00:15:38,570 --> 00:15:41,483
...but there were no slats out
that night.

184
00:15:42,908 --> 00:15:46,651
There were no stars...

185
00:15:47,313 --> 00:15:49,020
...that night.

186
00:16:05,331 --> 00:16:06,810
Honey...

187
00:16:07,099 --> 00:16:08,544
...you want some salad?

188
00:16:22,848 --> 00:16:24,452
<i>Mom?</i>

189
00:16:26,151 --> 00:16:27,721
Honey?

190
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:29,524
What happened?

191
00:16:29,722 --> 00:16:31,668
Did you have a bad dream?

192
00:16:32,324 --> 00:16:33,928
Come here.

193
00:16:36,028 --> 00:16:37,939
Yeah.

194
00:16:41,433 --> 00:16:43,140
Safe and sound.

195
00:16:43,335 --> 00:16:45,872
Safe and sound.

196
00:16:46,705 --> 00:16:48,275
<i>Mom?</i>

197
00:16:49,308 --> 00:16:52,187
Does Aunt Baby have to stay here?

198
00:17:04,156 --> 00:17:07,365
- Hurry up and eat your breakfast.
- I don't want wheat squares.

199
00:17:07,559 --> 00:17:10,005
They're ugly. I want rice squares.

200
00:17:10,195 --> 00:17:13,108
Wheat squares are the same
as rice squares.

201
00:17:13,298 --> 00:17:15,710
- One's wheat, one's rice.
- I need lunch money.

202
00:17:15,901 --> 00:17:17,744
- I can make you lunch.
- Olive loaf.

203
00:17:17,936 --> 00:17:22,009
What's wrong with my olive loaf?
You love my olive loaf. He's joking.

204
00:17:23,108 --> 00:17:24,553
Good morning. Look who's up.

205
00:17:25,711 --> 00:17:27,520
- Hey.

206
00:17:29,081 --> 00:17:31,459
- You didn't have to get up early.
- We're late.

207
00:17:31,650 --> 00:17:34,187
- You want some breakfast?
- Mom, lunch money.

208
00:17:34,653 --> 00:17:36,792
I'll get you some orange juice.

209
00:17:45,164 --> 00:17:47,735
- What's wrong?
- Is everyone leaving?

210
00:17:50,302 --> 00:17:53,010
You don't wanna be alone?
It's okay. Don't worry.

211
00:17:53,205 --> 00:17:56,743
I-- I'll be here with you.
I'm gonna take a few days off work.

212
00:17:56,942 --> 00:17:59,320
- Mom, I need lunch money.
- Just wait a second.

213
00:17:59,511 --> 00:18:01,684
All right, Mollie. Come on. Let's go.

214
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:03,882
Davis, here.

215
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:07,230
- Five bucks? It's a school lunch.
- Deal with it.

216
00:18:07,419 --> 00:18:09,057
- Bye. sweetie
- Okay.

217
00:18:09,254 --> 00:18:11,234
Just give me a second, okay?

218
00:18:12,291 --> 00:18:14,396
Davis.

219
00:18:14,593 --> 00:18:17,335
I have to pick Mollie up,
so come home after school.

220
00:18:17,529 --> 00:18:19,975
- No, honey, he's got debate team.
- I quit.

221
00:18:21,767 --> 00:18:23,804
- What did you say?
- I said, I quit.

222
00:18:24,703 --> 00:18:27,843
- You did what? Davis-
- Listen. Listen, it's gonna be okay.

223
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:31,021
Because today,
Davis has to take care of his aunt.

224
00:18:31,677 --> 00:18:32,781
We're late.

225
00:18:33,278 --> 00:18:35,383
We will talk about it later.

226
00:18:41,353 --> 00:18:42,627
They're gone.

227
00:18:42,821 --> 00:18:45,267
It's always really chaotic.

228
00:18:45,457 --> 00:18:47,767
All right, breakfast.

229
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:49,940
I n make you anything you want
Eggs?

230
00:18:50,129 --> 00:18:52,541
- Do you want some cereal?
- I'm not hungry.

231
00:18:53,632 --> 00:18:55,339
Okay.

232
00:18:55,968 --> 00:18:58,005
- Should I tum on the TV for you?
- No.

233
00:18:59,471 --> 00:19:01,883
- Music--
- I think--

234
00:19:03,075 --> 00:19:06,648
I think I'll just go smoke a cigarette
on the porch.

235
00:19:06,845 --> 00:19:08,290
Okay.

236
00:19:08,614 --> 00:19:10,059
Do you want some company?

237
00:19:12,284 --> 00:19:13,854
No.

238
00:19:38,310 --> 00:19:39,516
Madeleine.

239
00:19:39,711 --> 00:19:41,782
Hey, it's Billie.

240
00:19:43,448 --> 00:19:46,361
I'm gonna need a few more days.

241
00:19:46,618 --> 00:19:48,291
Yeah.

242
00:19:48,487 --> 00:19:51,900
Yeah, it's hit me harder
than I thought.

243
00:19:57,262 --> 00:19:58,707
<i>I am not incompetent.</i>

244
00:19:58,897 --> 00:20:01,036
<i>I know what I'm doing
every minute</i> and--

245
00:20:01,233 --> 00:20:03,509
Hey, you sure
you don't wanna watch TV?

246
00:20:03,702 --> 00:20:06,148
Would you turn it off, please?

247
00:20:07,873 --> 00:20:10,046
It makes me hear voices...

248
00:20:10,576 --> 00:20:12,419
...in my head.

249
00:20:13,612 --> 00:20:15,285
Sony.

250
00:20:42,774 --> 00:20:44,947
Mom, I'm home.

251
00:20:45,210 --> 00:20:46,883
Honey, where have you been?

252
00:20:47,079 --> 00:20:49,457
- I told you not to be late.
- I had a test.

253
00:20:49,648 --> 00:20:53,994
Oh, 100. That's good, my good boy.
You keep an eye on her.

254
00:21:15,907 --> 00:21:17,887
I have homework, so...

255
00:22:39,624 --> 00:22:41,069
Baby.

256
00:22:45,464 --> 00:22:47,569
Can you come in here?

257
00:22:47,766 --> 00:22:51,270
Would you mind helping me out?
I know you're such a good cook.

258
00:22:53,338 --> 00:22:55,284
- I can cook.
- Good.

259
00:22:57,642 --> 00:22:59,417
Yeah.

260
00:22:59,945 --> 00:23:01,356
Come on.

261
00:23:02,547 --> 00:23:06,154
You know what you should do? Make
a list for me. That's what Mom did.

262
00:23:06,351 --> 00:23:08,729
Oh, we don't need a list.

263
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:09,921
Hey, you know what?

264
00:23:10,122 --> 00:23:12,602
How about a pie?
Mollie loves peach pie.

265
00:23:13,959 --> 00:23:15,233
I can make an apple pie.

266
00:23:15,427 --> 00:23:20,399
That's right. You used to make it when
we were little. That was my favorite.

267
00:23:20,599 --> 00:23:22,272
Great.

268
00:23:22,467 --> 00:23:24,310
Apples are in the fridge.

269
00:23:30,876 --> 00:23:32,412
Here you go.

270
00:23:39,651 --> 00:23:44,566
Mollie's actually a lot like I am.
Well, like I was.

271
00:23:44,756 --> 00:23:49,535
She can't sit still
and she does lots of activities.

272
00:23:49,728 --> 00:23:52,641
Oh, yeah, and she's really athletic,
which Rick loves...

273
00:23:52,831 --> 00:23:56,643
...because, you know,
he was this big high-school jock.

274
00:23:57,235 --> 00:24:00,182
But she doesn't do very well
in school...

275
00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:03,849
...which is also like me, right?

276
00:24:05,777 --> 00:24:08,485
Actually,
completely different from Davis.

277
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:10,250
He's the brain, like you.

278
00:24:12,017 --> 00:24:14,827
But he spends lots of time
in his room...

279
00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:17,227
...and he doesn't
have many friends and-

280
00:24:17,422 --> 00:24:18,730
Like me?

281
00:24:18,924 --> 00:24:20,494
Well...

282
00:24:23,094 --> 00:24:25,335
...with his computer.

283
00:24:26,565 --> 00:24:29,239
You know,
and the video games and...

284
00:24:32,370 --> 00:24:33,610
Kids.

285
00:24:44,816 --> 00:24:46,124
- Good morning.
- Hey.

286
00:24:46,318 --> 00:24:47,558
Hey, Billie.

287
00:24:47,752 --> 00:24:49,163
How you feeling?

288
00:24:49,354 --> 00:24:51,334
Good. I'm good.

289
00:24:51,523 --> 00:24:53,764
It's no problem
if you wanna take more time.

290
00:24:53,959 --> 00:24:57,702
I'm fine. These are supposed
to be in the back, right?

291
00:24:57,963 --> 00:25:00,569
Okay. Billie, what's up?

292
00:25:05,537 --> 00:25:09,508
It wasn't just about my mother.

293
00:25:11,042 --> 00:25:13,181
My sister moved in.

294
00:25:13,545 --> 00:25:15,718
- I didn't know you had a sister.
- Yeah.

295
00:25:15,914 --> 00:25:19,123
Because I don't tell anyone,
because she's...

296
00:25:20,185 --> 00:25:22,665
- She has--
- Issues?

297
00:25:22,854 --> 00:25:24,390
Schizophrenia.

298
00:25:26,958 --> 00:25:28,062
That shut them up.

299
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:31,207
Billie, honey, I'm so sorry.

300
00:25:31,396 --> 00:25:33,171
Thanks.

301
00:25:33,765 --> 00:25:35,904
So does she like--?

302
00:25:36,101 --> 00:25:40,208
- Pull her hair out? Talk in tongues?
- I see them on the street. I didn't--

303
00:25:40,405 --> 00:25:43,181
No. No, she doesn't do any of that.

304
00:25:43,375 --> 00:25:45,582
In fact,
she doesn't do much of anything.

305
00:25:45,777 --> 00:25:47,120
She just...

306
00:25:47,512 --> 00:25:49,116
...sits...

307
00:25:49,915 --> 00:25:51,258
...and sits.

308
00:25:51,449 --> 00:25:55,022
- Did you suggest a walk or--?
- Yes, she's afraid of dogs.

309
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:56,824
A drive? She gets carsick.

310
00:25:57,022 --> 00:25:59,059
Movies? She hears voices.

311
00:25:59,791 --> 00:26:01,327
Clothes.

312
00:26:01,526 --> 00:26:02,527
Bring her here?

313
00:26:02,727 --> 00:26:03,728
- Yes.
- Yeah.

314
00:26:03,929 --> 00:26:06,136
She's not Cinderella, April.

315
00:26:06,331 --> 00:26:07,867
She's mentally ill.

316
00:26:08,066 --> 00:26:10,137
Does she wear clothes?

317
00:26:20,412 --> 00:26:22,187
Honey?

318
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:25,691
- It's midnight.
- Okay. Just wait.

319
00:26:26,351 --> 00:26:29,662
This inheritance, it's good. it's--

320
00:26:30,422 --> 00:26:33,028
- It's good. It's not great, but it's good.
- Okay.

321
00:26:33,224 --> 00:26:36,797
Your mother's house, it was rough.
She was mortgaged to her eyeballs.

322
00:26:36,995 --> 00:26:37,996
The market's soft.

323
00:26:38,196 --> 00:26:42,406
Even if we get half of what it's worth,
we can do a hell of a lot. Here, look.

324
00:26:43,068 --> 00:26:45,173
We pay the loan first.
That's number one.

325
00:26:45,370 --> 00:26:48,214
You have no idea
what a load off my back that'll be.

326
00:26:48,406 --> 00:26:51,876
We can start looking at the mortgage,
credit cards, the rest of it.

327
00:26:52,077 --> 00:26:54,853
I don't want you to think
we can catch up all the way.

328
00:26:55,046 --> 00:26:57,151
But at least we can get some...

329
00:26:57,716 --> 00:26:59,662
Some breathing room.

330
00:26:59,851 --> 00:27:01,797
And that's like-- That's...

331
00:27:01,987 --> 00:27:03,625
Honey, that's...

332
00:27:04,656 --> 00:27:06,033
That's good.

333
00:27:06,224 --> 00:27:08,135
That's really good.

334
00:27:09,127 --> 00:27:10,697
I know.

335
00:27:17,235 --> 00:27:18,771
Yeah.

336
00:27:19,004 --> 00:27:20,540
Yeah.

337
00:27:24,242 --> 00:27:26,848
What are you doing?

338
00:27:27,512 --> 00:27:29,492
We have a bedroom.

339
00:27:29,681 --> 00:27:32,662
- No, that's too far.
- No way.

340
00:27:45,530 --> 00:27:49,034
- I told you I don't wanna go.
- Come on. It'll be fine.

341
00:27:57,909 --> 00:28:00,082
You took your pills, right?

342
00:28:04,049 --> 00:28:05,528
Okay, then.

343
00:28:05,717 --> 00:28:07,594
We're all set.

344
00:28:32,310 --> 00:28:34,654
Don't worry, all right?

345
00:28:34,846 --> 00:28:37,156
We have beautiful things.

346
00:28:37,348 --> 00:28:41,296
- And it's all on me, anything you like
- I don't want anything.

347
00:28:43,988 --> 00:28:45,399
Come on.

348
00:28:56,835 --> 00:28:58,576
Are we in a rush?

349
00:29:04,609 --> 00:29:06,646
Sony.

350
00:29:10,415 --> 00:29:16,525
Hey. Madeleine, April,
this is my sister, Baby. Elizabeth.

351
00:29:17,288 --> 00:29:18,392
Hello, Elizabeth.

352
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:20,365
- Hi.
- Hi, nice to meet you.

353
00:29:20,558 --> 00:29:22,231
- Welcome.
- Hi.

354
00:29:23,795 --> 00:29:26,605
Did Billie tell you?
We have some stunning new pieces.

355
00:29:26,798 --> 00:29:31,269
If you'd like, I could show you around
maybe by a few things on.

356
00:29:32,203 --> 00:29:33,341
Okay.

357
00:29:33,538 --> 00:29:36,576
- Great. Here. Come with me.
- Yeah. This way.

358
00:29:36,775 --> 00:29:39,722
We'll find some things for you to ﬂy.
Anything you see-

359
00:29:39,911 --> 00:29:41,788
- What about this one?
- I like blue.

360
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:45,325
Okay. Well, we can try it, you know,
and if it works, it works.

361
00:29:45,517 --> 00:29:48,726
- Anything you don't like, let us know.
- We have tops in blue.

362
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:52,026
You said you like blue,
so maybe we can try those on too.

363
00:29:55,693 --> 00:29:57,001
Oh, you look great.

364
00:29:57,195 --> 00:30:00,301
- Let's take a look in the mirror.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

365
00:30:01,966 --> 00:30:03,206
Oh, you look so good.

366
00:30:03,401 --> 00:30:05,403
- Right, Billie?
- Yeah.

367
00:30:08,273 --> 00:30:10,947
We should go with jeans,
something a little simpler.

368
00:30:11,142 --> 00:30:13,418
- I think it's 
- Oh, yeah. The cream-

369
00:30:13,611 --> 00:30:16,615
- We were saying it's a little dressy
- A little too much.

370
00:30:16,815 --> 00:30:19,455
Maybe we should try that cream top
with the jeans.

371
00:30:19,651 --> 00:30:21,096
It's hanging right there.

372
00:30:21,286 --> 00:30:25,200
It's a very simple, easy look.
I think you'll like it.

373
00:30:26,057 --> 00:30:28,537
She didn't really--
I really didn't expect that.

374
00:30:28,726 --> 00:30:31,297
- Yeah, she carries it off.
- She likes clothes.

375
00:30:31,496 --> 00:30:32,702
<i>Listen. Listen to them.</i>

376
00:30:32,897 --> 00:30:35,844
<i>You know what they want.
Shouldn't be here.</i>

377
00:30:37,035 --> 00:30:38,742
- What did she say?
- I was just-

378
00:30:38,937 --> 00:30:40,507
- Miss?
- April, please help her.

379
00:30:40,705 --> 00:30:42,013
- Just go back in.
- Got it.

380
00:30:42,207 --> 00:30:45,017
Go back. Baby, Baby, it's okay.
It's okay.

381
00:30:45,210 --> 00:30:46,587
<i>Now she can't come in.</i>

382
00:30:46,778 --> 00:30:48,189
<i>You know what they want.</i>

383
00:30:48,379 --> 00:30:50,882
You have to be very quiet.
You have to be quiet.

384
00:30:51,082 --> 00:30:55,394
Just don't- Don't- They can hear me.
They can hear me. Just-

385
00:30:56,855 --> 00:30:59,165
Just be quiet.
If they could just be quiet.

386
00:30:59,357 --> 00:31:01,667
We pushed- We pushed her.
I'm so sorry.

387
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:02,998
Baby?

388
00:31:03,194 --> 00:31:05,902
Oh, my-- Just please--

389
00:31:06,764 --> 00:31:10,268
That's it. Because I'm just crazy.
Just tiptoe- Just-

390
00:31:10,468 --> 00:31:11,913
Baby?

391
00:31:12,103 --> 00:31:14,447
- Turn the knob, okay?
- Tiptoe. Tiptoe.

392
00:31:14,639 --> 00:31:16,619
- I know you can hear me.
- They think you-

393
00:31:16,808 --> 00:31:19,721
You crept away. You climbed out.
You just snuck out!

394
00:31:21,312 --> 00:31:23,519
- What's happening?
- Problem with the door.

395
00:31:23,715 --> 00:31:26,252
No, I'm not in here.

396
00:31:26,451 --> 00:31:29,796
--Something. I'll just need to--
We have rooms up front.

397
00:31:29,988 --> 00:31:32,468
Why don't we go there?
We can take care of that.

398
00:31:32,657 --> 00:31:33,965
Listen to me, okay?

399
00:31:34,659 --> 00:31:37,731
I have to run.
I have to run as fast as I can.

400
00:31:37,929 --> 00:31:41,706
They can't catch you, can't yell at you.
They can't tell you what to do.

401
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:43,243
Okay? Come out here.

402
00:31:43,434 --> 00:31:47,211
I'm almost there. I'm almost there.
I'm almost there. I'm gone.

403
00:31:47,405 --> 00:31:48,748
- Baby.
- I'm gone.

404
00:31:48,940 --> 00:31:50,578
I'm home. I'm home!

405
00:31:50,775 --> 00:31:52,618
Baby. Don't do this to me.

406
00:31:52,810 --> 00:31:55,450
- Don't do this to me.
- I'm home.

407
00:32:04,255 --> 00:32:05,928
Baby.

408
00:32:07,058 --> 00:32:08,867
Baby, we can get in the car.

409
00:32:09,060 --> 00:32:11,301
We could be home in 10 minutes,
okay?

410
00:32:11,496 --> 00:32:15,774
And you can just-
You can get right in bed, all right?

411
00:32:15,967 --> 00:32:18,038
Or you can...

412
00:32:18,236 --> 00:32:20,682
You can take your pills or...

413
00:32:21,439 --> 00:32:23,817
I mean, is that what you do
when this happens?

414
00:32:24,008 --> 00:32:27,046
When you start hearing voices?
I don't know what you--

415
00:32:32,050 --> 00:32:33,688
Do you want me to apologize?

416
00:32:33,885 --> 00:32:35,296
I'm sorry.

417
00:32:35,486 --> 00:32:37,864
It's not your fault.

418
00:32:38,056 --> 00:32:39,660
It's my fault, okay?

419
00:32:39,857 --> 00:32:43,202
I should never have brought you here.
I know that.

420
00:32:44,262 --> 00:32:47,004
So let's just get in the car, okay?

421
00:32:47,899 --> 00:32:50,345
Please, Baby.

422
00:32:52,337 --> 00:32:56,012
Okay. All right, everyone.
I have something to say.

423
00:32:56,207 --> 00:33:00,553
I dedicate this meal,
this wonderful meal--

424
00:33:00,745 --> 00:33:02,418
- Pizza?
- To Grandma Kathleen.

425
00:33:02,613 --> 00:33:05,287
- By her act of generosity, she--
- I'm not moving.

426
00:33:05,783 --> 00:33:09,526
Oh, no, no. No, honey, of course not.
We're not moving into the house.

427
00:33:09,721 --> 00:33:13,567
- She gave it to us to sell.
- It's for everyone, so we don't worry.

428
00:33:13,758 --> 00:33:15,328
- Are we worried?
- Yes.

429
00:33:15,526 --> 00:33:16,630
- No.
- No.

430
00:33:16,828 --> 00:33:18,398
No, Davis.

431
00:33:18,930 --> 00:33:23,242
Look, we just needed a little help
and that's what Grandma did for us.

432
00:33:24,102 --> 00:33:26,946
And there's an account
for you too, Baby. Of course.

433
00:33:27,672 --> 00:33:28,946
- You can have it.
- No.

434
00:33:29,140 --> 00:33:33,418
No, Baby, look, it's yours to do
with whatever, as you please.

435
00:33:33,611 --> 00:33:35,147
Do you understand?

436
00:33:36,981 --> 00:33:38,585
You always wanted a motorcycle.

437
00:33:38,783 --> 00:33:42,196
Now, wouldn't she look great
with a Harley, Mollie?

438
00:33:43,254 --> 00:33:44,562
I'd like a computer.

439
00:33:45,390 --> 00:33:46,698
Great. That's great.

440
00:33:46,891 --> 00:33:48,097
Okay. A computer. Look.

441
00:33:48,292 --> 00:33:50,704
Here, talk to the expert. Davis.

442
00:33:58,536 --> 00:33:59,913
It's gotta be fast.

443
00:34:00,104 --> 00:34:02,846
You think,
'I don't mind waiting a few seconds'...

444
00:34:03,041 --> 00:34:04,987
...but when you have to sit there...

445
00:34:05,176 --> 00:34:07,679
- Hey.
- Hi, Mom.

446
00:34:07,879 --> 00:34:10,382
- What you doing?
- Trying to find a computer.

447
00:34:10,581 --> 00:34:12,322
Any luck?

448
00:34:14,352 --> 00:34:17,356
You want HD, of course,
and as much memory as you can get.

449
00:34:17,555 --> 00:34:18,625
Cool.

450
00:34:19,557 --> 00:34:21,901
Oh, but if you only get
a 13-inch screen...

451
00:34:22,093 --> 00:34:23,697
...is that gonna be big enough?

452
00:34:23,895 --> 00:34:25,135
Thanks, Mom.

453
00:34:25,329 --> 00:34:27,639
But I think we're doing okay here.

454
00:34:30,935 --> 00:34:32,505
Okay.

455
00:34:39,210 --> 00:34:40,348
Hey, girls.

456
00:34:40,545 --> 00:34:42,218
- Hi.
- Hey.

457
00:34:43,147 --> 00:34:44,649
All right.

458
00:34:45,283 --> 00:34:48,264
You just click "enter"
and the computer's yours.

459
00:34:48,686 --> 00:34:53,328
Yeah. It is expensive, but it's like
my dad says when he bids a job.

460
00:34:53,524 --> 00:34:57,097
- Want it good or you want it cheap?
- You can use mine if you want to.

461
00:34:57,295 --> 00:34:59,468
What do I--? How--?

462
00:34:59,664 --> 00:35:01,337
Right there.

463
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:04,141
There it is.

464
00:35:04,368 --> 00:35:07,440
<i>Davis and crazy girl sitting in a tree</i>

465
00:35:07,638 --> 00:35:08,742
K-I-S-S--

466
00:35:10,575 --> 00:35:13,613
Say that again, I'm gonna hurl: you
Do you understand me?

467
00:35:13,811 --> 00:35:15,119
- What's going on?
- Do you?

468
00:35:15,313 --> 00:35:17,691
- Do you under--?
- Hey. Hey. What is happening?

469
00:35:17,882 --> 00:35:20,863
- What is going on?
- Why don't you ask her?

470
00:35:21,152 --> 00:35:22,927
Honey.

471
00:35:24,055 --> 00:35:25,466
What was that about?

472
00:35:30,828 --> 00:35:33,570
- Yeah, nice.
- Twenty years. I cannot believe it.

473
00:35:33,764 --> 00:35:34,834
It's like yesterday.

474
00:35:35,032 --> 00:35:36,375
- I know.
- I know. Amazing.

475
00:35:36,567 --> 00:35:39,377
I know the name of a great caterer,
if you'd like.

476
00:35:39,570 --> 00:35:42,517
- We're gonna do potluck.
- Yeah. It's probably a lot--

477
00:35:42,707 --> 00:35:44,311
Cheaper.

478
00:35:44,942 --> 00:35:47,047
- No, Douglas, not quite.
- It's great.

479
00:35:47,245 --> 00:35:49,851
- That's a great idea. Plus, it's not so--
- Formal.

480
00:35:50,047 --> 00:35:52,357
- Exactly.
- Yeah. Yeah, and cheaper.

481
00:35:52,550 --> 00:35:54,257
- Funny. More wine?
- Please.

482
00:35:54,452 --> 00:35:56,295
- Oh, honey.
- Another bottle of wine.

483
00:35:56,487 --> 00:35:58,023
Honey, it's late.

484
00:35:58,222 --> 00:36:00,395
No, come on.
The kids are gonna be fine.

485
00:36:00,591 --> 00:36:01,865
Yeah.

486
00:36:02,193 --> 00:36:05,640
No, we really-
We have to get home.

487
00:36:05,830 --> 00:36:07,400
We have an early start. Sony.

488
00:36:07,598 --> 00:36:09,202
- Oh, no. I understand
- Okay.

489
00:36:09,767 --> 00:36:11,474
Thanks.

490
00:36:13,404 --> 00:36:15,748
Outside. We could fit
a hundred people there.

491
00:36:15,940 --> 00:36:20,616
I'm not saying I'm gonna invite 100
of my closest friends, but I think it's--

492
00:36:21,679 --> 00:36:23,488
Honey, is something wrong?

493
00:36:25,750 --> 00:36:28,788
I told Mollie that she shouldn't
invite her friends over...

494
00:36:28,986 --> 00:36:30,556
...and we should do the same.

495
00:36:30,755 --> 00:36:32,200
- Honey-
- You weren't here.

496
00:36:32,390 --> 00:36:36,133
- I had to break up a fight.
- A fight? What fight?

497
00:36:37,094 --> 00:36:41,873
Mollie used the word "crazy"
about Baby and then Davis just--

498
00:36:42,066 --> 00:36:45,138
I mean, they're fine. They're fine.

499
00:36:45,336 --> 00:36:49,079
That is what people will think when
they meet her and I don't want that.

500
00:36:49,273 --> 00:36:51,879
Do you really believe
you can keep her a secret?

501
00:36:52,076 --> 00:36:54,989
- Honey, this is an opportunity-
- Not the sales pitch.

502
00:36:55,179 --> 00:36:58,160
--To have this great party
and, "Hey, here's my sister."

503
00:36:58,349 --> 00:37:00,124
Who might start talking to voices.

504
00:37:00,318 --> 00:37:03,527
- Don't let that spoil the good time.
- She can go upstairs.

505
00:37:03,721 --> 00:37:07,396
- And sit at the computer with Davis?
- He's been good for her.

506
00:37:07,592 --> 00:37:08,627
Great.

507
00:37:08,826 --> 00:37:10,863
My crazy sister with my--

508
00:37:11,062 --> 00:37:12,905
-With your what?
- Nothing.

509
00:37:13,097 --> 00:37:15,805
- What were you gonna say?
- This isn't about Davis.

510
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,980
- They're two peas in a pod, right?
- No.

511
00:37:18,169 --> 00:37:21,707
- Yeah, smart, alone. No friends.
- He's sensitive. He's not a joiner.

512
00:37:21,906 --> 00:37:24,682
- He's in his room all the time.
- He's not into sports.

513
00:37:24,875 --> 00:37:27,116
- Don't even start.
- That's what kills you.

514
00:37:27,311 --> 00:37:29,416
You don't worry about him, huh?

515
00:37:30,147 --> 00:37:32,024
You don't worry?

516
00:37:34,952 --> 00:37:37,990
You want a party, fine.
We'll have a party.

517
00:37:38,189 --> 00:37:42,797
And we'll trot my little sister out
for everyone to see, okay?

518
00:37:43,127 --> 00:37:45,573
And you're damn right I worry.

519
00:37:58,376 --> 00:38:00,151
They had a fight. Did you hear it?

520
00:38:01,679 --> 00:38:03,590
Hard to miss.

521
00:38:04,849 --> 00:38:06,795
Did you hear what they said?

522
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:11,622
They think I'm like you.

523
00:38:14,492 --> 00:38:16,665
Your mom said something.

524
00:38:18,562 --> 00:38:21,338
- What?
- You know, I studied like you.

525
00:38:21,532 --> 00:38:24,342
And I stayed in my room too. it's--

526
00:38:24,535 --> 00:38:26,913
They say I'm the smartest one
in the family...

527
00:38:27,104 --> 00:38:30,278
...but you'd never know
because of what happened to me.

528
00:38:33,044 --> 00:38:35,081
What did happen to you?

529
00:38:41,252 --> 00:38:46,429
Your mom and I had a fight,
like we always did after I got sick.

530
00:38:46,624 --> 00:38:51,972
But I spoiled her last year in school,
which I didn't mean to, but I--

531
00:38:52,596 --> 00:38:55,805
- I started hearing voices.
- Yeah.

532
00:38:56,334 --> 00:38:57,836
I read about...

533
00:38:58,736 --> 00:39:00,647
Schizophrenia.

534
00:39:02,406 --> 00:39:03,817
It's okay. You can say it.

535
00:39:05,142 --> 00:39:07,122
Schizophrenia.

536
00:39:12,350 --> 00:39:16,025
Anyway, it was
your mom's prom night.

537
00:39:16,220 --> 00:39:19,599
And she was there with her date
and she was taking her pictures.

538
00:39:19,790 --> 00:39:22,293
And she looked beautiful and...

539
00:39:23,928 --> 00:39:28,673
I thought that she needed something
in her hair because I'm very visual.

540
00:39:28,866 --> 00:39:32,905
I-- You know, I see something
and once I think it, I have to do it.

541
00:39:33,104 --> 00:39:36,677
So I went
and I gal: this really special pin...

542
00:39:36,874 --> 00:39:40,014
...and I tried to,
but she didn't want it.

543
00:39:40,211 --> 00:39:41,884
She...

544
00:39:42,713 --> 00:39:47,025
And she started yelling
and screaming...

545
00:39:47,218 --> 00:39:49,596
...and calling me names,
and the voices were--

546
00:39:49,787 --> 00:39:51,232
- Yeah, right.
- It was all--

547
00:39:51,422 --> 00:39:54,130
So I jumped out the window.

548
00:40:01,098 --> 00:40:02,600
They took me to the hospital.

549
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:05,713
And the doctors diagnosed me
with schizophrenia.

550
00:40:05,903 --> 00:40:08,440
And that was- We knew now.
At least we knew.

551
00:40:08,639 --> 00:40:11,620
And Mom started crying.
She said she started crying.

552
00:40:11,809 --> 00:40:14,722
I don't remember. That's the thing.
You don't remember.

553
00:40:14,912 --> 00:40:17,518
You remember things,
but you don't.

554
00:40:18,649 --> 00:40:23,462
So my mom took me home
and she took care of me...

555
00:40:24,188 --> 00:40:25,292
...all these years.

556
00:40:25,489 --> 00:40:27,491
She really did.

557
00:40:34,298 --> 00:40:37,040
But they're wrong about you,
you know?

558
00:40:37,234 --> 00:40:40,238
You don't-- You're not like me.

559
00:40:40,871 --> 00:40:42,612
- No?
- No.

560
00:40:42,807 --> 00:40:46,277
I'm an expert on these things.
I could tell. I could see the signs.

561
00:40:46,477 --> 00:40:52,359
No, I think you just haven't found
the right group of people...

562
00:40:53,150 --> 00:40:57,929
...or the right person
to connect with.

563
00:40:58,122 --> 00:40:59,533
You know?

564
00:40:59,990 --> 00:41:02,994
Someone to listen.
That's all you need.

565
00:41:07,398 --> 00:41:10,572
Are Mom and Dad gonna dance?
I don't wanna see them dance.

566
00:41:10,768 --> 00:41:12,372
Have you ever seen them dance?

567
00:41:12,570 --> 00:41:14,572
Or any of those people?

568
00:41:14,772 --> 00:41:16,479
Are they all gonna dance?

569
00:41:16,674 --> 00:41:19,348
Is it gonna be like a dance party?

570
00:41:19,677 --> 00:41:23,181
- I'm sorry. Did you say something?
- Davis.

571
00:41:39,129 --> 00:41:40,301
-Hey.

572
00:41:40,498 --> 00:41:41,704
What did you do?

573
00:41:43,367 --> 00:41:47,577
What did I do? What did I do? I made
the house better, that's what I did.

574
00:41:47,771 --> 00:41:50,183
Davis, you wanna help me with this?
This chair?

575
00:41:50,374 --> 00:41:51,478
Sure.

576
00:41:51,675 --> 00:41:53,279
It's feng shui.

577
00:41:53,477 --> 00:41:57,015
- I'm gonna put this chair over here.
- Okay.

578
00:41:57,214 --> 00:41:58,716
Right-- Right there.

579
00:41:58,916 --> 00:41:59,917
Yeah. See that?

580
00:42:00,117 --> 00:42:02,757
See the way the light hits the arms
of the chair?

581
00:42:03,387 --> 00:42:04,764
I'm like an artist here.

582
00:42:04,955 --> 00:42:08,903
My teacher in ninth grade
Mr.- Mr...

583
00:42:09,527 --> 00:42:12,474
It's okay. I already forgot my teachers
from last year.

584
00:42:12,863 --> 00:42:15,571
He always said I should
go to art school.

585
00:42:15,933 --> 00:42:17,378
But...

586
00:42:18,002 --> 00:42:21,711
Mom always said I made the
house beautiful, so that's what I do.

587
00:42:21,906 --> 00:42:24,182
That's what I did here, right? Right?

588
00:42:24,375 --> 00:42:27,720
Your mom's gonna love it.
She's gonna love it, right?

589
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:31,783
- I bought it.
- Do you think it's enough?

590
00:42:31,982 --> 00:42:34,929
- It's plenty. And I can always go back-
- You sure? Okay.

591
00:42:37,254 --> 00:42:39,530
What do you think? It's feng shui.

592
00:42:40,057 --> 00:42:42,059
I made the house better.

593
00:42:42,293 --> 00:42:44,830
Your house is now
in perfect harmony.

594
00:42:45,029 --> 00:42:46,235
Really?

595
00:42:46,430 --> 00:42:49,775
No kidding.
Well, that would be a change.

596
00:42:52,002 --> 00:42:53,675
You have to put it back.

597
00:42:53,871 --> 00:42:55,111
We have a party tonight.

598
00:42:55,306 --> 00:42:58,446
- Which is coming up, so get ready.
- It's for the party.

599
00:42:58,943 --> 00:43:02,186
- I think it looks good.
- Oh, do you, Mr. Interior Decorator?

600
00:43:02,379 --> 00:43:05,758
- It's not his fault.
- Look, it's nobody's fault.

601
00:43:05,950 --> 00:43:08,123
I want my house back...

602
00:43:08,319 --> 00:43:09,559
...the way it was.

603
00:43:11,522 --> 00:43:13,661
- Mom, you-
- No.

604
00:43:15,693 --> 00:43:17,001
You want your house back?

605
00:43:19,830 --> 00:43:22,003
I'll put it back,
if that's what you want.

606
00:43:22,199 --> 00:43:23,837
Thank you.

607
00:43:24,935 --> 00:43:26,573
It's always what you want.

608
00:43:26,770 --> 00:43:28,113
What?

609
00:43:29,473 --> 00:43:32,352
- What did you say?
- I said, it's always what you want.

610
00:43:32,543 --> 00:43:34,250
You wanna go to the stupid store.

611
00:43:34,445 --> 00:43:37,449
It was a bad idea, but we go
because that's what you want.

612
00:43:37,648 --> 00:43:39,924
Excuse me for thinking
you might enjoy it.

613
00:43:40,117 --> 00:43:42,859
You've never liked anything
that I ever did for you.

614
00:43:43,053 --> 00:43:46,398
- You never did anything for me
- I took you in.

615
00:43:46,590 --> 00:43:48,866
- I cook your meals.
- Let's not do this now.

616
00:43:49,059 --> 00:43:51,369
I don't go to work
so you won't be alone.

617
00:43:51,562 --> 00:43:54,702
- You're afraid of what I'll do.
- And look what happened.

618
00:43:54,898 --> 00:43:56,844
- You want me to leave?
- Of course not.

619
00:43:57,034 --> 00:44:01,141
It was always easier if I wasn't there.
You used to chase me away.

620
00:44:01,338 --> 00:44:03,375
I never chased you away.

621
00:44:03,574 --> 00:44:08,546
I've forgotten almost everything. I can't
forget you standing with your friends...

622
00:44:08,746 --> 00:44:12,558
...stomping your foot, telling me
to get out like I was some kind of dog.

623
00:44:12,750 --> 00:44:15,731
Making a fool out of me.
Isn't that what you want now?

624
00:44:15,919 --> 00:44:19,628
- Come on. Isn't that what you want?
- No, that's enough. Stop it!

625
00:44:19,890 --> 00:44:21,369
That's enough.

626
00:44:21,558 --> 00:44:23,003
Both of you.

627
00:44:23,193 --> 00:44:26,970
Look, we just want everyone
to get ready for the party, okay?

628
00:44:27,164 --> 00:44:30,270
We can talk about this later, calmly.

629
00:44:34,405 --> 00:44:36,316
Come on, honey.

630
00:44:36,507 --> 00:44:38,043
You wanna know what I want?

631
00:44:41,512 --> 00:44:43,890
I want my life back.

632
00:45:01,398 --> 00:45:02,399
Hi.

633
00:45:02,599 --> 00:45:03,805
How are you?

634
00:45:04,001 --> 00:45:05,605
Hello.

635
00:45:06,837 --> 00:45:08,009
- Hi, Baby.
- Hey.

636
00:45:08,205 --> 00:45:09,878
It's so good to see you again.

637
00:45:10,074 --> 00:45:13,647
The place looks great, doesn't it?
The lights and the water?

638
00:45:14,411 --> 00:45:16,891
I know. It's beautiful, right?

639
00:45:32,296 --> 00:45:34,469
- Yes.
- I don't want the cheesy one.

640
00:45:34,665 --> 00:45:35,666
No, I know.

641
00:45:40,070 --> 00:45:41,413
- Hey.

642
00:45:45,142 --> 00:45:47,088
My mom was wrong.

643
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:51,853
I think what you did was...

644
00:45:52,382 --> 00:45:54,020
...beautiful.

645
00:45:59,356 --> 00:46:01,893
She just likes things
the way she does them.

646
00:46:03,560 --> 00:46:06,473
And forget what she said.

647
00:46:07,631 --> 00:46:09,941
She's all bent about the party.

648
00:46:11,301 --> 00:46:12,939
Plus...

649
00:46:14,304 --> 00:46:18,184
-...I don't want you to leave.
- Someone tum the music off, please.

650
00:46:18,776 --> 00:46:22,656
Please, everyone. I'd like to--
I would like to say a few words.

651
00:46:22,846 --> 00:46:25,053
Someone is supposed
to make the toast...

652
00:46:25,249 --> 00:46:28,492
...but, hey, it's my party,
so I thought I'd start.

653
00:46:29,186 --> 00:46:33,191
- It was 20 years ago today--
- Everybody get comfortable.

654
00:46:33,857 --> 00:46:35,495
Hey, I'm gonna keep this short.

655
00:46:35,692 --> 00:46:38,332
As I was saying
before I was rudely interrupted...

656
00:46:38,529 --> 00:46:41,135
...that it was 20 years ago today...

657
00:46:41,331 --> 00:46:43,834
I became the luckiest man
in the world...

658
00:46:44,034 --> 00:46:47,015
...when Billie Davis fumed to me
and said yes.

659
00:46:48,205 --> 00:46:50,481
She doesn't understand you
like I do.

660
00:46:50,674 --> 00:46:52,847
I think it's because she's jealous.

661
00:46:53,043 --> 00:46:56,547
I mean, you've got this artistic soul
and she's...

662
00:46:57,114 --> 00:46:58,593
Well, she sells dresses.

663
00:46:58,782 --> 00:47:00,193
And then I turn around...

664
00:47:00,384 --> 00:47:03,297
...and that little baby
is telling me how uncool I am...

665
00:47:03,487 --> 00:47:06,866
...and my son's in high school.
How did the hell did that happen?

666
00:47:07,758 --> 00:47:10,705
To the girl I married
20 years ago today...

667
00:47:10,894 --> 00:47:13,636
...and to the wonderful children
she created. Mollie.

668
00:47:13,831 --> 00:47:16,710
Mollie, come here, honey.
Look at my little princess.

669
00:47:17,301 --> 00:47:19,406
And Davis. Where's Davis?

670
00:47:19,603 --> 00:47:21,776
- Where's my genius?
- Genius.

671
00:47:21,972 --> 00:47:23,576
Davis?

672
00:47:24,141 --> 00:47:26,087
- Where's your brother?
- I don't know.

673
00:47:26,276 --> 00:47:30,383
Well, anyway, hopefully he's not
in the kitchen with the champagne.

674
00:47:31,648 --> 00:47:33,594
No, in all seriousness...

675
00:47:34,751 --> 00:47:35,889
I like being alone.

676
00:47:37,487 --> 00:47:39,592
I can't tell anyone that...

677
00:47:41,058 --> 00:47:42,799
...except you.

678
00:47:48,999 --> 00:47:50,410
Cheers.

679
00:47:50,601 --> 00:47:52,308
What are you doing?

680
00:47:53,337 --> 00:47:57,046
What are you doing to my son?
What are you doing?

681
00:47:57,241 --> 00:47:59,778
Look at me. Look at me!

682
00:47:59,977 --> 00:48:02,423
What were you doing to my son?

683
00:48:02,613 --> 00:48:04,615
What did you do?

684
00:48:05,182 --> 00:48:06,820
What have you done?

685
00:48:07,017 --> 00:48:08,121
What?

686
00:48:13,056 --> 00:48:15,400
- Did you see what's happening?
- I don't know.

687
00:48:17,461 --> 00:48:19,600
- Billie.
- No.

688
00:48:20,430 --> 00:48:22,068
Wait, Billie.

689
00:48:25,736 --> 00:48:27,238
I don't care if she's sick.

690
00:48:27,437 --> 00:48:29,644
- Those are my kids.
- Be quiet. Be quiet.

691
00:48:29,840 --> 00:48:32,446
Those are my kids
and she can't slay here anymore.

692
00:48:32,643 --> 00:48:35,419
- What do you want me to do?
- Get her out.

693
00:48:35,612 --> 00:48:37,853
You're the one
who wanted to have the party.

694
00:48:38,048 --> 00:48:40,460
You're the one
who said it would all be fine.

695
00:48:40,651 --> 00:48:43,723
- You're blaming me?
-'She's family. You're all she's got.'

696
00:48:43,921 --> 00:48:45,867
- That's what you said.
- No. I didn't--

697
00:48:46,056 --> 00:48:47,626
You did. That's what you said.

698
00:48:47,824 --> 00:48:50,703
I sure as hell didn't think
this would happen.

699
00:48:55,565 --> 00:48:57,169
I gotta go check on Davis.

700
00:49:07,945 --> 00:49:09,686
Davis?

701
00:49:13,750 --> 00:49:14,785
Davis?

702
00:49:18,188 --> 00:49:20,691
Why doesn't my door have a lock?

703
00:49:23,994 --> 00:49:25,667
Oh, honey.

704
00:49:26,830 --> 00:49:27,900
Is it my fault, Mom?

705
00:49:28,432 --> 00:49:29,706
No.

706
00:49:29,900 --> 00:49:31,106
It wasn't your fault.

707
00:49:31,301 --> 00:49:33,781
She thought I wanted to kiss her.

708
00:49:36,006 --> 00:49:39,351
You've been such a good friend to her
and she's very pretty.

709
00:49:39,543 --> 00:49:40,817
What?

710
00:49:41,011 --> 00:49:42,354
It's confusing.

711
00:49:42,546 --> 00:49:45,186
For God's sake.
She's my aunt, Mom.

712
00:49:45,382 --> 00:49:47,623
She's mentally ill.

713
00:49:47,985 --> 00:49:49,658
How desperate do you think I am?

714
00:49:49,853 --> 00:49:51,526
No, that's not what I meant.

715
00:49:53,390 --> 00:49:57,361
I just wanted to be her friend. Nobody
would have anything to do with her.

716
00:49:57,561 --> 00:49:59,905
- That's not true.
- It is.

717
00:50:00,931 --> 00:50:02,933
And it's not her fault. It's mine.

718
00:50:03,133 --> 00:50:06,774
- It wasn't your fault.
- And it was yours.

719
00:50:06,970 --> 00:50:10,611
Does it matter if she moves
furniture around? It's just furniture.

720
00:50:10,807 --> 00:50:13,754
She can't help what she does, Mom,
but you can.

721
00:50:18,982 --> 00:50:20,723
Okay.

722
00:50:25,922 --> 00:50:28,129
We'll talk about this in the morning.

723
00:50:28,325 --> 00:50:29,804
Wait.

724
00:50:30,293 --> 00:50:32,637
You have to tell me
what you did with her.

725
00:50:32,829 --> 00:50:35,241
- What do you mean?
- I went to see how she was.

726
00:50:36,199 --> 00:50:37,576
She's not there, Mom.

727
00:50:45,142 --> 00:50:46,746
Baby?

728
00:50:47,310 --> 00:50:49,051
Baby?

729
00:50:50,013 --> 00:50:51,219
Baby.

730
00:50:51,415 --> 00:50:53,019
See?

731
00:51:12,903 --> 00:51:15,474
I know how it is
to see someone in that condition.

732
00:51:15,672 --> 00:51:17,083
But Elizabeth is not dying.

733
00:51:17,274 --> 00:51:20,414
She's suffering from catatonia,
which means that her mind...

734
00:51:20,610 --> 00:51:23,250
...has, in effect,
shut down temporarily.

735
00:51:23,447 --> 00:51:26,826
So we're gonna go ahead
and transfer her to the state hospital...

736
00:51:27,017 --> 00:51:28,997
...just until she recovers...

737
00:51:29,186 --> 00:51:31,427
...and we can get
to the bottom of this.

738
00:51:31,621 --> 00:51:33,692
But from what you've told me...

739
00:51:33,890 --> 00:51:36,734
...I would say
that all these changes in her life...

740
00:51:36,927 --> 00:51:39,203
...were simply too much for her.

741
00:51:40,363 --> 00:51:42,809
Have there been difficulties
at home?

742
00:51:44,434 --> 00:51:48,507
She stays in her room, doesn't
socialize and says strange things.

743
00:51:49,739 --> 00:51:51,412
You fight?

744
00:51:53,877 --> 00:51:56,483
Have you ever thought
of residential care?

745
00:52:12,596 --> 00:52:14,542
I'm sorry. I wish we could afford it.

746
00:52:14,731 --> 00:52:16,108
It's just so beautiful.

747
00:52:16,299 --> 00:52:18,142
Yeah, but there's just--

748
00:52:18,335 --> 00:52:20,337
There's just no way.

749
00:52:24,307 --> 00:52:26,446
There's a couple more places
on the list.

750
00:52:26,643 --> 00:52:27,951
Okay.

751
00:52:33,717 --> 00:52:36,926
Well, it's not cheap,
but I think that it--

752
00:52:37,120 --> 00:52:38,497
Well, it's competitive.

753
00:52:39,923 --> 00:52:41,561
What do you think?

754
00:52:41,858 --> 00:52:45,635
If you decide to go with us,
we'd put your sister on the waiting list.

755
00:52:45,829 --> 00:52:48,070
- There's a waiting list?
- Three years.

756
00:52:49,866 --> 00:52:52,506
Well, you haven't been looking
very long, have you?

757
00:52:52,702 --> 00:52:54,181
No, this week.

758
00:52:54,371 --> 00:52:57,318
The psychiatric facilities in this area,
in the state...

759
00:52:57,507 --> 00:53:01,216
...in this whole country, for that matter
are oversubscribed.

760
00:53:01,545 --> 00:53:03,422
There is a last resort.

761
00:53:03,947 --> 00:53:06,860
Board and care.
It's not gonna be on your list.

762
00:53:07,050 --> 00:53:09,394
It's basically a room,
two meals a day...

763
00:53:09,586 --> 00:53:12,192
and some supervision. Some.

764
00:55:08,905 --> 00:55:10,384
Baby?

765
00:55:15,045 --> 00:55:17,025
I'm sorry. I...

766
00:55:19,049 --> 00:55:22,826
It's hard for me to talk
with the drugs.

767
00:55:29,526 --> 00:55:32,097
Oh, I hope Davis doesn't hate me.

768
00:55:32,295 --> 00:55:35,742
I have to say I'm sorry. That's okay.

769
00:55:35,932 --> 00:55:38,344
I'll just-- I'll apologize. I'll--

770
00:55:38,535 --> 00:55:40,845
I'll see him, right?

771
00:55:41,037 --> 00:55:42,744
I'll tell him...

772
00:55:47,844 --> 00:55:49,323
Well...

773
00:55:51,581 --> 00:55:52,889
...that's too bad.

774
00:55:53,083 --> 00:55:56,223
That's too bad.

775
00:55:59,956 --> 00:56:04,234
Will you tell him something for me?

776
00:56:04,427 --> 00:56:10,275
Will you tell him
that all those years...

777
00:56:11,234 --> 00:56:12,372
...I lived with Mom...

778
00:56:12,569 --> 00:56:17,279
...I didn't know
that I was missing anything.

779
00:56:17,474 --> 00:56:22,184
I didn't know. I didn't know anything
until you took me in.

780
00:56:22,379 --> 00:56:26,191
And then I saw everything
that you had.

781
00:56:26,383 --> 00:56:30,354
A house, a job, children.

782
00:56:32,288 --> 00:56:34,165
A man.

783
00:56:37,394 --> 00:56:41,137
And I started to think:

784
00:56:41,331 --> 00:56:44,278
"Why can't I have that?

785
00:56:44,467 --> 00:56:46,310
Why do I have to be alone?

786
00:56:46,503 --> 00:56:50,349
Why do I have to have nobody
and nothing...

787
00:56:51,141 --> 00:56:54,145
...when you have everything?"

788
00:56:59,649 --> 00:57:02,061
Then there he was, Davis.

789
00:57:02,252 --> 00:57:05,756
He was so sweet, he was so kind.

790
00:57:05,955 --> 00:57:08,162
And I just thought,
"Why can't I have him?

791
00:57:08,358 --> 00:57:11,896
Just for one moment.
Just for one kiss. Just one."

792
00:57:12,095 --> 00:57:16,510
It was so, so sweet.

793
00:57:23,173 --> 00:57:25,016
That's not--

794
00:57:25,208 --> 00:57:28,212
That's not fair. I shou--

795
00:57:29,712 --> 00:57:32,488
I shouldn't ask you,
but you're my sister.

796
00:57:32,682 --> 00:57:35,959
You're all I got,
so I want you to tell me.

797
00:57:36,453 --> 00:57:38,524
What, Baby? Tell you what?

798
00:57:39,022 --> 00:57:41,434
Am I so different?

799
00:57:41,624 --> 00:57:43,729
Am I so frightening?

800
00:57:43,927 --> 00:57:49,240
Am I so ugly
that no one's ever gonna want me?

801
00:57:50,967 --> 00:57:55,006
I want you to tell me. Is this all I get?

802
00:57:56,606 --> 00:57:59,348
Is this it for me?

803
00:58:25,068 --> 00:58:27,605
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

804
00:58:27,804 --> 00:58:29,249
I'm sorry for crying.

805
00:58:29,439 --> 00:58:31,749
I know. It's okay.

806
00:58:32,976 --> 00:58:36,480
- I don't usually cry, you know?
- I know.

807
00:58:49,092 --> 00:58:51,572
They're releasing Baby
at the end of the week...

808
00:58:51,761 --> 00:58:53,934
...and I'm gonna bring her home.

809
00:58:57,133 --> 00:59:00,671
She knows what she did was wrong
and she's so sorry.

810
00:59:00,870 --> 00:59:05,046
And I don't want her to come here
and mess up our lives again...

811
00:59:05,575 --> 00:59:08,021
...but I just can't send her away.

812
00:59:09,012 --> 00:59:11,390
- We had an agreement, didn't we?
- Yes, but--

813
00:59:11,581 --> 00:59:14,187
- You should stick to it.
- She's taking her meds.

814
00:59:14,384 --> 00:59:15,954
- You forget what she did?
- No.

815
00:59:16,152 --> 00:59:18,029
- I can't.
- What do you want me to do?

816
00:59:18,221 --> 00:59:20,462
Drive downtown,
drop her on a street comer?

817
00:59:20,657 --> 00:59:24,537
- I'm sorry, but she cannot come back.
- It's my house too.

818
00:59:29,165 --> 00:59:32,044
If you bring her back here, Billie...

819
00:59:33,002 --> 00:59:34,072
...I'll leave.

820
00:59:35,004 --> 00:59:37,109
And I'll take the kids with me.

821
01:00:10,940 --> 01:00:11,941
<i>Mom?</i>

822
01:00:14,110 --> 01:00:15,487
Why aren't you at work?

823
01:00:15,678 --> 01:00:17,954
Is school out?

824
01:00:26,322 --> 01:00:28,393
You and Dad had a fight?

825
01:00:30,026 --> 01:00:32,370
He doesn't want Baby to come back.

826
01:00:35,231 --> 01:00:36,232
It's my fault.

827
01:00:37,867 --> 01:00:39,744
I thought it was my fault.

828
01:00:40,303 --> 01:00:42,283
I don't want her to come back either.

829
01:00:42,472 --> 01:00:45,749
I don't want Mollie to call her a freak,
you and Dad to fight.

830
01:00:45,942 --> 01:00:48,684
Sol have this idea.
You wanna hear it?

831
01:00:48,911 --> 01:00:50,322
Yeah.

832
01:00:50,513 --> 01:00:52,356
You take Baby to the ranch.

833
01:00:52,548 --> 01:00:55,154
Aunt Will said
she could come with us, right?

834
01:00:55,985 --> 01:00:57,555
I looked it up.

835
01:00:58,121 --> 01:01:00,658
Maybe she'd shirt remembering
the good times...

836
01:01:00,857 --> 01:01:02,495
...with you and everybody.

837
01:01:02,692 --> 01:01:04,899
It might help her somehow.

838
01:01:06,396 --> 01:01:09,002
I don't exactly know how.
I don't know anything.

839
01:01:09,198 --> 01:01:11,804
Isn't that better
than watching her come back...

840
01:01:12,001 --> 01:01:14,948
...and drop into that chair
and just smoke all day?

841
01:01:27,850 --> 01:01:29,295
- Hey.

842
01:01:29,852 --> 01:01:31,297
- Hey.

843
01:01:33,856 --> 01:01:35,301
I'm--

844
01:01:35,491 --> 01:01:37,937
I'm not gonna bring Baby home.

845
01:01:38,661 --> 01:01:41,574
I thought that would get
your attention.

846
01:01:42,632 --> 01:01:44,077
I'm taking her to the ranch.

847
01:01:45,635 --> 01:01:48,241
Davis can look after Mollie...

848
01:01:49,005 --> 01:01:52,953
...and I'm gonna cook some dinners
and put them in the fridge for you.

849
01:01:57,547 --> 01:01:59,049
Billie.

850
01:02:00,383 --> 01:02:01,919
Call me.

851
01:02:03,486 --> 01:02:05,329
Tell me how it's going, okay?

852
01:02:06,989 --> 01:02:08,525
Okay.

853
01:02:35,551 --> 01:02:37,087
Baby...

854
01:02:37,587 --> 01:02:39,328
...I have something to tell you.

855
01:02:40,590 --> 01:02:42,263
We're not going home.

856
01:02:42,458 --> 01:02:44,631
I'm taking you to Aunt Will's.

857
01:02:44,827 --> 01:02:47,239
- Where?
- The ranch.

858
01:02:47,430 --> 01:02:49,671
You remember the ranch?

859
01:02:50,199 --> 01:02:52,008
I don't wanna--

860
01:02:54,003 --> 01:02:55,573
Look, I won't go near Davis.

861
01:02:55,772 --> 01:02:57,911
I won't bother Mollie.

862
01:02:58,107 --> 01:03:00,644
I could stay up in my room.

863
01:03:02,178 --> 01:03:03,816
Billie?

864
01:03:35,111 --> 01:03:37,648
Welcome to the ranch.

865
01:03:39,182 --> 01:03:41,162
It's been so long.

866
01:03:41,350 --> 01:03:42,954
Baby.

867
01:03:45,855 --> 01:03:49,735
This is Billie and this is you.

868
01:03:50,960 --> 01:03:53,668
And your mom and your dad.

869
01:03:54,397 --> 01:03:55,933
Look how young Kathleen is.

870
01:03:57,266 --> 01:03:59,610
Honey, that's just frogs.

871
01:03:59,802 --> 01:04:01,509
They make such a racket.

872
01:04:01,971 --> 01:04:04,542
They make so much noise.

873
01:04:10,713 --> 01:04:12,522
Hey, look.

874
01:04:18,521 --> 01:04:20,694
Remember this?

875
01:04:21,457 --> 01:04:23,767
You must have been, what...?

876
01:04:23,960 --> 01:04:25,371
About 3.

877
01:04:25,561 --> 01:04:28,872
And look, you could already write
your own name.

878
01:04:29,732 --> 01:04:31,302
Always so smart.

879
01:04:35,204 --> 01:04:36,706
I'm getting kind of tired.

880
01:04:39,742 --> 01:04:41,779
Baby, are you all right?

881
01:04:43,813 --> 01:04:45,793
Yeah, I'll be all right.

882
01:05:08,905 --> 01:05:11,852
And this is what I wanted
to show you.

883
01:05:17,313 --> 01:05:18,917
Remember?

884
01:05:21,083 --> 01:05:23,359
You used to love it here.

885
01:05:24,587 --> 01:05:28,160
All these horses are boarders.
That's how Aunt Will makes her living.

886
01:05:30,092 --> 01:05:32,038
- Hey.

887
01:05:32,228 --> 01:05:33,798
Good boy.

888
01:05:33,996 --> 01:05:35,498
Yeah.

889
01:05:35,698 --> 01:05:37,678
You want to pet him?

890
01:05:41,804 --> 01:05:43,442
Good.

891
01:05:43,940 --> 01:05:46,181
You were such a great rider.

892
01:05:46,375 --> 01:05:49,117
When we were young,
you could ride circles around me.

893
01:05:49,312 --> 01:05:51,155
I was so jealous.

894
01:05:51,347 --> 01:05:52,951
Me?

895
01:05:53,816 --> 01:05:56,160
You wanna go for a ride?

896
01:05:59,155 --> 01:06:02,227
We'll ride together. I'll sheer.
You just hold on.

897
01:06:15,071 --> 01:06:18,280
All right. You can do it.
Put your left foot in the stirrup.

898
01:06:18,474 --> 01:06:20,545
Here, grab the horn.

899
01:06:21,010 --> 01:06:22,819
I won't let you fall. I promise.

900
01:06:24,880 --> 01:06:26,120
Great.

901
01:06:26,315 --> 01:06:28,852
And you put your foot back
in the stirrup.

902
01:06:29,352 --> 01:06:30,922
All right.

903
01:06:32,221 --> 01:06:33,825
Are you ready?

904
01:06:34,423 --> 01:06:35,527
Okay, here we go.

905
01:06:41,764 --> 01:06:44,040
You remember how it feels?

906
01:06:44,233 --> 01:06:45,803
Well...

907
01:06:46,002 --> 01:06:48,448
I don't know. Maybe.

908
01:06:48,637 --> 01:06:50,344
Do you like it?

909
01:06:51,674 --> 01:06:52,982
Yeah.

910
01:06:53,175 --> 01:06:55,553
- Good.
- Yeah, I do.

911
01:07:05,187 --> 01:07:07,929
So I found this at a garage sale...

912
01:07:08,124 --> 01:07:12,038
...and the lady wanted $10 for it
with this broken tail.

913
01:07:23,439 --> 01:07:24,941
There. See?

914
01:07:25,141 --> 01:07:27,121
All better.

915
01:07:30,212 --> 01:07:32,055
- Hello.
- It's me.

916
01:07:32,715 --> 01:07:34,251
Why haven't you called me?

917
01:07:34,450 --> 01:07:36,157
I haven't because I've been--

918
01:07:36,352 --> 01:07:39,424
I don't know. I've been waiting
for something to happen.

919
01:07:39,622 --> 01:07:41,363
Well, what happened?

920
01:07:41,624 --> 01:07:43,570
<i>Baby's better.</i>

921
01:07:43,993 --> 01:07:45,973
You won't recognize her.

922
01:07:47,430 --> 01:07:50,968
Well, that's great, honey.

923
01:07:54,670 --> 01:07:56,274
I think you should come up.

924
01:07:56,472 --> 01:07:58,748
<i>It's really beautiful here.</i>

925
01:07:58,941 --> 01:08:02,548
Aunt Will would love to see the kids
and so would I.

926
01:08:03,179 --> 01:08:05,352
<i>And Baby's getting better.</i>

927
01:08:05,714 --> 01:08:07,091
Yeah, you said that.

928
01:08:07,283 --> 01:08:12,130
<i>Look,</i> I <i>think it's better
if we just wait it out where we are.</i>

929
01:08:13,722 --> 01:08:15,258
I miss you.

930
01:08:16,192 --> 01:08:19,730
Yeah. Look, hey, I gotta run.

931
01:08:20,563 --> 01:08:22,338
- Okay
- Bye.

932
01:08:52,795 --> 01:08:55,537
Nice. Good job.

933
01:09:51,353 --> 01:09:54,857
Oh, my God. I can't believe it.

934
01:09:55,991 --> 01:09:58,335
I missed you so much.

935
01:09:58,527 --> 01:10:00,734
Oh, I'm so happy you're here.

936
01:10:00,930 --> 01:10:02,341
Oh, it's gonna be great.

937
01:10:02,531 --> 01:10:04,169
Wait till you see the horses.

938
01:10:04,366 --> 01:10:05,777
You're gonna love it.

939
01:10:05,968 --> 01:10:06,969
- Hi.
- Hi.

940
01:10:07,169 --> 01:10:09,149
You're amazing.

941
01:10:19,081 --> 01:10:20,958
Hello, Baby.

942
01:10:22,218 --> 01:10:24,061
How you doing?

943
01:10:25,087 --> 01:10:26,464
I'm doing well.

944
01:10:29,992 --> 01:10:32,404
I'm doing really well.
I think it's this place.

945
01:10:32,595 --> 01:10:35,804
I feel like it saved my life.
It's given me my life back.

946
01:10:39,702 --> 01:10:41,875
I'm starting to remember things too.

947
01:10:42,071 --> 01:10:44,642
Did you know your mom
was named after Aunt Will...

948
01:10:44,840 --> 01:10:47,150
...and their real name
is Wilhelmina?

949
01:10:48,110 --> 01:10:52,286
When I was 8 and Billie was 11
we stole two horses and rode off...

950
01:10:52,481 --> 01:10:54,984
...because we didn't wanna
come back home.

951
01:10:56,085 --> 01:10:57,792
It's good.

952
01:10:57,987 --> 01:11:00,968
It's really good.
I think it's this place, you know?

953
01:11:01,156 --> 01:11:04,296
I didn't come here alter I gal: sick
so it's not infected.

954
01:11:08,597 --> 01:11:09,735
Does that sound scaly?

955
01:11:09,932 --> 01:11:12,572
I'm sorry.
I don't wanna scare anyone.

956
01:11:15,371 --> 01:11:16,714
- Anyway...
- Anyway--

957
01:11:16,905 --> 01:11:20,478
Anyway, who wants to go for a ride?

958
01:11:21,310 --> 01:11:23,813
Mollie, you wanna go for a ride?

959
01:11:24,013 --> 01:11:25,424
Can I?

960
01:11:27,016 --> 01:11:29,326
Oh, good. Then I can take you.

961
01:11:29,518 --> 01:11:33,398
I'm gelling really, really so good
at this stuff.

962
01:11:33,589 --> 01:11:35,626
And this one is my favorite.

963
01:11:35,824 --> 01:11:38,236
His name is Chester.

964
01:11:39,561 --> 01:11:41,234
Go to sleep.

965
01:11:44,967 --> 01:11:47,106
- Good night, honey.
- Good night.

966
01:11:47,303 --> 01:11:48,907
- Good night, Davis.
- Good night.

967
01:11:49,104 --> 01:11:50,947
Can I kiss you too?

968
01:11:53,842 --> 01:11:56,448
You're a genius, you know that?

969
01:11:57,880 --> 01:12:00,326
Does it make you uncomfortable
to see her?

970
01:12:01,116 --> 01:12:03,528
- She's so different.
- I know.

971
01:12:04,186 --> 01:12:06,530
- Better.
- Much.

972
01:12:06,722 --> 01:12:08,201
I'm glad.

973
01:12:09,591 --> 01:12:11,229
Me too.

974
01:12:16,365 --> 01:12:18,811
And there is nothing wrong
with you.

975
01:12:42,691 --> 01:12:44,295
- Hey.

976
01:12:46,228 --> 01:12:47,229
Even/body's in bed.

977
01:12:47,429 --> 01:12:50,638
I'll be up in a minute.
I wanna sit here and think for a bit.

978
01:12:50,833 --> 01:12:52,972
This is the best place to think.

979
01:12:53,168 --> 01:12:56,809
And I can think now. I don't have
all those voices in my head.

980
01:12:57,005 --> 01:13:00,145
I have ideas. Ideas.

981
01:13:00,442 --> 01:13:04,891
- Okay, just-
- No, don't. I'm good, Billie.

982
01:13:05,080 --> 01:13:08,527
- I'm so good and you know why?
- The ranch.

983
01:13:08,717 --> 01:13:11,220
Yeah, you know what I'm thinking?
I should slay.

984
01:13:11,420 --> 01:13:14,367
- I should stay here. I wanna stay here.
- Stay here?

985
01:13:14,556 --> 01:13:16,866
It's not a bad idea.
Aunt Will's getting old.

986
01:13:17,059 --> 01:13:19,733
I could help her like I helped Mom.

987
01:13:19,928 --> 01:13:22,272
And no one would have to worry
about me.

988
01:13:22,464 --> 01:13:25,638
I could help with those horses.
Something about those horses.

989
01:13:25,834 --> 01:13:28,678
I'm telling you, this place is magic.

990
01:13:30,639 --> 01:13:33,449
I know. I'm hiking too much,
but I'm excited.

991
01:13:33,642 --> 01:13:34,882
I can remember things...

992
01:13:35,077 --> 01:13:38,149
...but I don't remember
the last time I felt this good.

993
01:13:39,548 --> 01:13:42,051
It's okay for me to feel good, right?

994
01:13:42,251 --> 01:13:43,889
Yeah. Yeah. Of course.

995
01:13:45,654 --> 01:13:49,101
- Just come up to bed soon, all right?
- Okay, Mom.

996
01:13:49,425 --> 01:13:50,597
No, I Will. I Will.

997
01:13:50,793 --> 01:13:53,569
I'm just gonna sit here for a little bit.

998
01:13:53,796 --> 01:13:55,503
I just feel...

999
01:13:58,534 --> 01:14:00,172
...normal.

1000
01:14:04,039 --> 01:14:05,712
Okay.

1001
01:14:06,241 --> 01:14:07,845
Good night.

1002
01:14:32,201 --> 01:14:33,976
Stay there.

1003
01:14:39,641 --> 01:14:42,315
Billie, look.

1004
01:14:42,511 --> 01:14:45,287
Billie, look at what I'm doing
Isn't it nice?

1005
01:14:45,881 --> 01:14:49,590
I know. I know. You don't like it
because you don't like anything I do.

1006
01:14:49,785 --> 01:14:53,198
But it doesn't matter anymore
because this is my house.

1007
01:14:55,491 --> 01:14:59,371
Oh, Billie. I have something very
very awful to tell you.

1008
01:15:00,195 --> 01:15:01,697
Aunt Will...

1009
01:15:01,897 --> 01:15:03,399
Aunt Will is dead.

1010
01:15:04,032 --> 01:15:08,174
She died in my arms. You weren't
there, like you weren't there for Mom.

1011
01:15:08,370 --> 01:15:11,317
Because you were too busy,
in bed with him.

1012
01:15:11,507 --> 01:15:12,884
How was he?

1013
01:15:13,075 --> 01:15:14,520
She died in my arms, Billie.

1014
01:15:14,710 --> 01:15:17,623
In my arms. With her last breath,
she gave me the house.

1015
01:15:17,813 --> 01:15:21,022
- Did you stop taking your pills?
- No. No. I didn't forget.

1016
01:15:21,216 --> 01:15:24,527
I didn't forget the pills
because they're for your house.

1017
01:15:24,720 --> 01:15:27,223
- Not my house.
- Hey, put down the scissors.

1018
01:15:27,422 --> 01:15:31,097
You're jealous because my house
is better than your house.

1019
01:15:31,293 --> 01:15:33,295
Look. Look at what I can do.

1020
01:15:33,495 --> 01:15:35,873
- I can do something I could never do.
- No. No.

1021
01:15:36,064 --> 01:15:37,566
Call 911!

1022
01:15:37,766 --> 01:15:40,542
Because I have talent and you don't.

1023
01:15:40,736 --> 01:15:42,579
- Baby!
- You have no talent.

1024
01:15:42,771 --> 01:15:44,148
- Baby!
- Stop!

1025
01:15:46,341 --> 01:15:47,786
The faces.

1026
01:15:47,976 --> 01:15:50,217
Oh, the faces.

1027
01:15:50,412 --> 01:15:51,755
I'm an artist.

1028
01:15:51,947 --> 01:15:53,858
- I'm an artist.
- Okay.

1029
01:15:54,049 --> 01:15:57,792
Don't you understand? You can't
understand. You couldn't understand.

1030
01:15:57,986 --> 01:16:02,093
None of you could understand
except for Davis.

1031
01:16:03,025 --> 01:16:04,527
- Davis, you--
- Baby. No.

1032
01:16:04,726 --> 01:16:06,706
You-- You get it.

1033
01:16:06,895 --> 01:16:10,274
You're sweet, beautiful, smart.
Don't let them take that away.

1034
01:16:10,465 --> 01:16:14,914
- Stay right where you are, Davis.
- You wanna help me, Davis?

1035
01:16:15,103 --> 01:16:17,310
You can help me with the house
if you want.

1036
01:16:17,506 --> 01:16:20,851
I have plenty of it left
and I have so many plans!

1037
01:16:21,043 --> 01:16:22,886
- Get to your rooms!
- No. No.

1038
01:16:26,582 --> 01:16:29,392
Baby, stop it right now! Stop it!

1039
01:16:29,952 --> 01:16:32,398
- You did this to me.
- No.

1040
01:16:32,588 --> 01:16:35,432
- You did. You did this to me.
- Stop it. Just shop it.

1041
01:16:35,624 --> 01:16:37,399
You did this to me, Billie.

1042
01:16:37,593 --> 01:16:40,005
- You did this. You weren't there.
- No.

1043
01:16:40,195 --> 01:16:42,801
- Why? Why did you hurt me like that?
- No.

1044
01:16:42,998 --> 01:16:44,409
- Did I hurt you?
- It's okay.

1045
01:16:44,600 --> 01:16:47,945
- Did I chase you away like a dog?
- It's okay. No. Look at me.

1046
01:16:48,136 --> 01:16:50,514
- Like a stinking dog?
- No, no.

1047
01:16:50,706 --> 01:16:51,980
Get away, mutt.

1048
01:16:52,174 --> 01:16:53,847
- You stinking mutt
- Stop.

1049
01:16:54,042 --> 01:16:55,350
- Stop.
- Thank God.

1050
01:16:55,544 --> 01:16:57,217
Yeah. Run, Billie. Run.

1051
01:16:57,412 --> 01:16:59,619
- Stop it! Calm down.
- There's no ambulance.

1052
01:16:59,815 --> 01:17:00,987
What did you tell them?

1053
01:17:01,183 --> 01:17:03,356
I told them
she was destroying my house.

1054
01:17:03,552 --> 01:17:06,692
- No, they're not gonna understand
- Stop it!

1055
01:17:06,888 --> 01:17:08,697
- Shut up.
- What's going on?

1056
01:17:08,890 --> 01:17:10,426
I hear them.

1057
01:17:10,626 --> 01:17:12,037
Oh, I hear them.

1058
01:17:12,227 --> 01:17:14,332
They're killing my horses.

1059
01:17:14,529 --> 01:17:17,373
Oh, God. They're killing my horses.

1060
01:17:17,966 --> 01:17:20,003
- Baby!
- No.

1061
01:17:20,202 --> 01:17:21,579
- No.
- Stay where you are.

1062
01:17:21,770 --> 01:17:24,114
- Don't you dare touch my horses.
- Baby, slop.

1063
01:17:24,306 --> 01:17:26,308
Don't hurt her! She's ill!

1064
01:17:26,508 --> 01:17:28,954
- Don't you touch them, please.
- On the ground.

1065
01:17:29,144 --> 01:17:30,555
- She's crazy.
- No, wait.

1066
01:17:30,746 --> 01:17:32,555
- Please don't hurt her.
- Stay back.

1067
01:17:32,748 --> 01:17:34,853
- Stay back.
- Baby. Don't hurt her. Stop.

1068
01:17:35,050 --> 01:17:36,620
- Look at me. Stay back.
- Wait.

1069
01:17:36,818 --> 01:17:37,956
- Billie.
- Calm down.

1070
01:17:38,153 --> 01:17:42,898
- You're hurting her. Baby!
- Oh, Billie.

1071
01:17:50,465 --> 01:17:51,910
They're asleep.

1072
01:17:54,703 --> 01:17:56,478
Aunt Will, honey, it's late.

1073
01:17:56,672 --> 01:17:58,674
Go to bed, all right?

1074
01:18:00,375 --> 01:18:01,752
Look.

1075
01:18:03,278 --> 01:18:04,552
Imagine that.

1076
01:18:09,017 --> 01:18:11,520
I'm so sorry.

1077
01:18:12,421 --> 01:18:15,402
I didn't know what to say to them.

1078
01:18:15,590 --> 01:18:18,002
I know. It's okay.

1079
01:18:18,193 --> 01:18:19,638
Here.

1080
01:18:19,828 --> 01:18:21,774
- All right.
- I got you.

1081
01:18:21,963 --> 01:18:23,943
- Thank you.
- There you go.

1082
01:18:24,132 --> 01:18:25,611
Well...

1083
01:18:33,208 --> 01:18:35,279
How did your mother do it?

1084
01:18:35,777 --> 01:18:37,950
All those years?

1085
01:18:42,284 --> 01:18:43,820
Good night.

1086
01:18:46,988 --> 01:18:48,797
Well, that worked out, didn't it?

1087
01:18:52,561 --> 01:18:54,268
You tried.

1088
01:18:57,432 --> 01:19:00,970
I tried and I failed.

1089
01:19:01,436 --> 01:19:03,211
- Over and over again.
- No, Billie--

1090
01:19:03,405 --> 01:19:05,908
I did. I hurt her.

1091
01:19:07,375 --> 01:19:10,652
The truth is,
I don't know how to help her.

1092
01:19:10,846 --> 01:19:12,348
And I want to.

1093
01:19:12,547 --> 01:19:16,393
I want her to be happy
and on that horse...

1094
01:19:16,585 --> 01:19:18,758
Oh, she was...

1095
01:19:20,489 --> 01:19:23,163
She was my sister again.

1096
01:19:24,226 --> 01:19:26,035
Now she's--

1097
01:19:26,228 --> 01:19:29,175
She's just that crazy woman.

1098
01:19:29,364 --> 01:19:31,310
And I miss her.

1099
01:20:16,878 --> 01:20:19,791
Today at ballet,
someone sprained their ankle.

1100
01:20:19,981 --> 01:20:23,485
We thought she sprained her ankle.
But she actually broke it.

1101
01:20:23,685 --> 01:20:26,723
She has to get surgery now.
She went to the hospital.

1102
01:20:26,922 --> 01:20:29,129
She was the best dancer
in the class.

1103
01:20:29,324 --> 01:20:31,031
And she was the lead in the show.

1104
01:20:35,997 --> 01:20:37,772
Honey, you sleeping?

1105
01:20:37,966 --> 01:20:39,343
No.

1106
01:20:40,202 --> 01:20:41,681
Are you?

1107
01:20:41,937 --> 01:20:44,543
No, I'm just thinking.

1108
01:20:51,513 --> 01:20:54,357
I know she can't stay here.

1109
01:20:55,250 --> 01:20:56,456
She needs--

1110
01:20:56,651 --> 01:20:58,494
Professional help.

1111
01:20:58,687 --> 01:21:00,257
Yeah.

1112
01:21:06,394 --> 01:21:08,874
I think that's what we should do.

1113
01:21:13,268 --> 01:21:14,611
But...

1114
01:21:16,171 --> 01:21:18,173
...can we afford it?

1115
01:21:21,109 --> 01:21:23,214
We'll work it out.

1116
01:21:24,312 --> 01:21:26,952
You would do that for her?

1117
01:21:27,148 --> 01:21:28,525
Yeah, for her.

1118
01:21:28,717 --> 01:21:30,754
And for us.

1119
01:22:02,984 --> 01:22:06,056
Baby, I have something to tell you.

1120
01:22:06,254 --> 01:22:07,858
And I want you to listen.

1121
01:22:08,056 --> 01:22:09,831
Are you listening?

1122
01:22:11,259 --> 01:22:12,795
Baby?

1123
01:22:17,098 --> 01:22:18,805
Elizabeth.

1124
01:22:23,471 --> 01:22:25,678
You can't stay here.

1125
01:22:25,941 --> 01:22:27,750
That's the decision.

1126
01:22:29,044 --> 01:22:31,354
But it isn't a punishment.

1127
01:22:31,546 --> 01:22:33,253
It's a reward.

1128
01:22:33,448 --> 01:22:34,984
I don't want any reward.

1129
01:22:36,651 --> 01:22:39,154
Remember at the ranch...

1130
01:22:39,721 --> 01:22:43,692
...you said if you could just stay there,
that you would feel normal again?

1131
01:22:43,892 --> 01:22:46,236
- I don't remember.
- Yes, you do.

1132
01:22:46,428 --> 01:22:48,806
You were so excited.

1133
01:22:49,097 --> 01:22:52,101
You wanted it more than anything,
didn't you?

1134
01:22:53,134 --> 01:22:57,480
Well, we'd like to take you to a place
that could give you that.

1135
01:22:58,940 --> 01:23:01,352
- What kind of a place?
- It's a beautiful place.

1136
01:23:01,543 --> 01:23:03,386
It's like a college campus.

1137
01:23:04,412 --> 01:23:07,450
- A nuthouse
- No.

1138
01:23:07,649 --> 01:23:10,789
It's a place that can give you a life.

1139
01:23:11,252 --> 01:23:13,698
That's what you want, isn't it?

1140
01:23:14,289 --> 01:23:16,360
But I wanna stay here.

1141
01:23:16,558 --> 01:23:18,902
But what would you do
if you stayed here?

1142
01:23:19,094 --> 01:23:21,040
You would sit in that chair.

1143
01:23:21,229 --> 01:23:22,765
So what? What does it matter?

1144
01:23:22,964 --> 01:23:25,911
- It doesn't matter.
- It matters to me.

1145
01:23:32,640 --> 01:23:34,779
It's my job...

1146
01:23:37,178 --> 01:23:39,886
...to help you get what you need.

1147
01:23:41,249 --> 01:23:44,753
It was Mom's job for all those years.

1148
01:23:47,188 --> 01:23:50,135
And it's my job now.

1149
01:23:51,092 --> 01:23:53,299
And I'm telling you...

1150
01:23:53,561 --> 01:23:55,734
...that you can't stay here.

1151
01:23:58,433 --> 01:24:01,414
You have to go to a place...

1152
01:24:01,603 --> 01:24:04,311
...that will make you have a life.

1153
01:24:05,573 --> 01:24:07,280
Okay?

1154
01:24:10,812 --> 01:24:12,883
I'm afraid.

1155
01:24:17,285 --> 01:24:18,389
Me too.

1156
01:24:48,750 --> 01:24:49,990
May I?

1157
01:24:57,425 --> 01:24:59,132
Goodbye, Baby.

1158
01:24:59,561 --> 01:25:00,596
I'll come visit you.

1159
01:25:19,080 --> 01:25:20,923
I'll call you, okay?

1160
01:25:45,773 --> 01:25:48,151
I have something
I wanna show you.

1161
01:25:48,776 --> 01:25:51,154
- I'll stay here.
- Okay.
