1
00:00:32,465 --> 00:00:34,068
Growing up on staten island,

2
00:00:34,068 --> 00:00:35,536
Barbara and I had often heard

3
00:00:35,536 --> 00:00:39,472
The legend of cropsey.

4
00:00:39,472 --> 00:00:40,507
For the kids in our

5
00:00:40,507 --> 00:00:42,008
Neighborhood, cropsey was the

6
00:00:42,008 --> 00:00:43,611
Escaped mental patient who lived

7
00:00:43,611 --> 00:00:45,179
In the tunnels beneath the old,

8
00:00:45,179 --> 00:00:46,614
Abandoned willowbrook mental

9
00:00:46,614 --> 00:00:49,750
Institution...

10
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:52,519
Who would come out late at night

11
00:00:52,519 --> 00:00:53,786
And snatch children off the

12
00:00:53,786 --> 00:00:55,723
Streets.

13
00:00:59,059 --> 00:01:00,060
Although we didn't know each

14
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:01,929
Other as children, Barbara and I

15
00:01:01,929 --> 00:01:03,431
Had both shared versions of the

16
00:01:03,431 --> 00:01:04,797
Cropsey legend as it filtered

17
00:01:04,797 --> 00:01:05,833
Through our separate

18
00:01:05,833 --> 00:01:07,234
Neighborhoods and seeped into

19
00:01:07,234 --> 00:01:08,768
Our collective fears.

20
00:01:08,768 --> 00:01:10,938
Sometimes cropsey had a hook for

21
00:01:10,938 --> 00:01:11,639
A hand.

22
00:01:11,639 --> 00:01:13,740
Other times he wielded a bloody

23
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:14,207
Ax.

24
00:01:14,207 --> 00:01:15,742
But it didn't matter.

25
00:01:15,742 --> 00:01:17,777
Cropsey was out there, lurking

26
00:01:17,777 --> 00:01:19,846
In the shadows, waiting to get

27
00:01:19,846 --> 00:01:21,615
Us.

28
00:01:21,615 --> 00:01:23,751
We're... we're gonna get her

29
00:01:23,751 --> 00:01:25,285
Back.

30
00:01:25,285 --> 00:01:26,154
[ Sobbing ]

31
00:01:26,154 --> 00:01:29,422
Okay.

32
00:01:29,422 --> 00:01:30,891
Later, as teenagers, we

33
00:01:30,891 --> 00:01:32,425
Assumed cropsey was just an

34
00:01:32,425 --> 00:01:34,195
Urban legend, a cautionary tale

35
00:01:34,195 --> 00:01:35,796
Used to keep us out of those

36
00:01:35,796 --> 00:01:37,430
Buildings... to stop us from

37
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:38,998
Doing all those things that

38
00:01:38,998 --> 00:01:42,335
Teenagers like to do.

39
00:01:42,335 --> 00:01:43,771
But all that changed the summer

40
00:01:43,771 --> 00:01:46,674
Little Jennifer disappeared.

41
00:01:46,674 --> 00:01:48,341
That was the summer all the kids

42
00:01:48,341 --> 00:01:49,842
From staten island discovered

43
00:01:49,842 --> 00:01:53,012
That their urban legend...

44
00:01:53,012 --> 00:01:54,947
Was real.

45
00:03:33,414 --> 00:03:35,047
Staten island is one of the five

46
00:03:35,081 --> 00:03:36,484
Boroughs of New York City.

47
00:03:36,484 --> 00:03:38,150
For the past century, the island

48
00:03:38,150 --> 00:03:39,619
Was mostly just farmland and

49
00:03:39,619 --> 00:03:41,255
Woods...

50
00:03:41,255 --> 00:03:43,089
That was, until they built the

51
00:03:43,089 --> 00:03:44,624
Verrazano bridge in '64.

52
00:03:44,624 --> 00:03:46,459
Now it's home to nearly half a

53
00:03:46,459 --> 00:03:49,596
Million people.

54
00:03:49,596 --> 00:03:51,030
Before the verrazano bridge

55
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:52,400
Was built, that's all it was.

56
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:53,767
It was just this island, this

57
00:03:53,767 --> 00:03:54,667
Forgotten island.

58
00:03:54,667 --> 00:03:56,035
All the children of Brooklyn,

59
00:03:56,035 --> 00:03:57,570
You know, wanted their own home,

60
00:03:57,570 --> 00:03:58,772
And everybody wants land.

61
00:03:58,772 --> 00:04:00,240
You have a dog, you let him out

62
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,574
The backyard, just like, you

63
00:04:01,574 --> 00:04:02,943
Know, "father knows best."

64
00:04:02,943 --> 00:04:04,312
It can be pretty quiet.

65
00:04:04,312 --> 00:04:05,813
I mean, even though Manhattan

66
00:04:05,813 --> 00:04:07,179
Is, like, right across the

67
00:04:07,179 --> 00:04:08,448
Water, it's definitely a

68
00:04:08,448 --> 00:04:10,350
Different life out here.

69
00:04:10,350 --> 00:04:12,720
If you travel around sometimes,

70
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:13,953
People would say, "oh, right",

71
00:04:13,953 --> 00:04:15,288
That's where the largest garbage

72
00:04:15,288 --> 00:04:15,788
Dump was.

73
00:04:15,788 --> 00:04:17,089
And, you know, rumor has it you

74
00:04:17,089 --> 00:04:18,391
"Could see it from outer space."

75
00:04:18,391 --> 00:04:21,894
So one big garbage dump.

76
00:04:21,894 --> 00:04:23,864
It was the least-populated,

77
00:04:23,864 --> 00:04:25,732
Most heavily wooded borough.

78
00:04:25,732 --> 00:04:27,635
From what I understand, like,

79
00:04:27,635 --> 00:04:29,736
This is a big dumping ground for

80
00:04:29,736 --> 00:04:30,638
Mob bodies.

81
00:04:30,638 --> 00:04:32,705
Someone needs to be disposed of,

82
00:04:32,705 --> 00:04:34,741
It's like, "let's bring them to"

83
00:04:34,741 --> 00:04:36,977
Staten island."

84
00:04:36,977 --> 00:04:38,578
It's like there's almost too

85
00:04:38,578 --> 00:04:39,980
Many spaces to go to to be

86
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:41,349
Isolated and alone and do

87
00:04:41,349 --> 00:04:42,383
Whatever you want.

88
00:04:42,383 --> 00:04:43,851
So if you have a bad idea in

89
00:04:43,851 --> 00:04:48,220
Your head, you can do it there.

90
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:49,357
Across the middle of the

91
00:04:49,357 --> 00:04:50,657
Island lies a section of ancient

92
00:04:50,657 --> 00:04:53,861
Forest known as the greenbelt.

93
00:04:53,861 --> 00:04:55,563
Bordering this forest is a

94
00:04:55,563 --> 00:04:57,229
Boy scout camp and an old

95
00:04:57,229 --> 00:05:00,300
Tuberculosis ward.

96
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:02,670
As kids, we used to roam around

97
00:05:02,670 --> 00:05:04,070
These grounds, trying to scare

98
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:05,439
Each other with stories about

99
00:05:05,439 --> 00:05:07,941
Cropsey.

100
00:05:07,941 --> 00:05:09,209
Is that pouch camp over

101
00:05:09,209 --> 00:05:09,877
To the left?

102
00:05:09,877 --> 00:05:11,311
No, that's jcc camp over to

103
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:11,879
The left.

104
00:05:11,879 --> 00:05:13,480
And right here... this is

105
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:15,115
Sea view, the t.B. Wards.

106
00:05:15,115 --> 00:05:16,984
Our camp counselors would lead

107
00:05:16,984 --> 00:05:18,819
Us down this path, and they'd

108
00:05:18,819 --> 00:05:20,653
Come out of the buildings and

109
00:05:20,653 --> 00:05:24,124
Scare us.

110
00:05:24,124 --> 00:05:25,626
You know, this is where we

111
00:05:25,626 --> 00:05:27,460
Thought that cropsey lived... in

112
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:29,261
The basements down in here and

113
00:05:29,261 --> 00:05:30,730
In these other buildings.

114
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:32,433
And, you know, we used to walk

115
00:05:32,433 --> 00:05:34,701
Through here, and you'd find

116
00:05:34,701 --> 00:05:37,037
Beds and papers of people who

117
00:05:37,037 --> 00:05:38,304
Had died here.

118
00:05:38,304 --> 00:05:40,608
So, you know, it kind of made

119
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:43,411
Sense to us.

120
00:05:43,411 --> 00:05:46,046
"Cropsey," for some reason,

121
00:05:46,046 --> 00:05:48,616
Became the generic term for a

122
00:05:48,616 --> 00:05:51,385
Maniac in boy scout camps up and

123
00:05:51,385 --> 00:05:56,155
Down the Hudson river region of

124
00:05:56,188 --> 00:05:57,757
New York state.

125
00:05:57,757 --> 00:05:59,726
So it would've made perfect

126
00:05:59,726 --> 00:06:01,595
Sense for a story about a

127
00:06:01,595 --> 00:06:03,864
Maniac who was hiding out in the

128
00:06:03,864 --> 00:06:05,365
Woods and who abducted and

129
00:06:05,365 --> 00:06:06,934
Killed little children to be

130
00:06:06,934 --> 00:06:07,901
Called cropsey.

131
00:06:07,901 --> 00:06:09,603
First learned about cropsey

132
00:06:09,603 --> 00:06:10,570
In summer camp.

133
00:06:10,570 --> 00:06:11,705
He was a doctor.

134
00:06:11,705 --> 00:06:13,305
He was supposed to have a

135
00:06:13,305 --> 00:06:13,774
Hook.

136
00:06:13,774 --> 00:06:15,508
With a knife about this big.

137
00:06:15,508 --> 00:06:17,110
And he was an ax-wielding

138
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:17,777
Madman.

139
00:06:17,777 --> 00:06:19,379
The wife was killed.

140
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:21,080
He was being chased or

141
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:21,814
Taunted.

142
00:06:21,814 --> 00:06:23,116
He wanted kids.

143
00:06:23,116 --> 00:06:26,119
And he would find them and...

144
00:06:26,119 --> 00:06:28,121
He would hack you up.

145
00:06:28,121 --> 00:06:29,021
Chop 'em up.

146
00:06:29,021 --> 00:06:30,691
"Don't go behind the Sherwood"

147
00:06:30,691 --> 00:06:31,191
Bunks.

148
00:06:31,191 --> 00:06:32,392
"Cropsey's out there."

149
00:06:32,392 --> 00:06:34,061
"Make sure you get off at the"

150
00:06:34,061 --> 00:06:34,528
Mall.

151
00:06:34,528 --> 00:06:35,828
Don't continue to go any

152
00:06:35,828 --> 00:06:36,295
"Further."

153
00:06:36,295 --> 00:06:37,565
"Don't go down by the lake at"

154
00:06:37,565 --> 00:06:37,965
Night.

155
00:06:37,965 --> 00:06:38,899
"Cropsey's down there."

156
00:06:38,899 --> 00:06:39,766
"No, don't go near"

157
00:06:39,766 --> 00:06:40,534
Willowbrook park.

158
00:06:40,534 --> 00:06:42,835
"Willowbrook park is dangerous."

159
00:06:42,835 --> 00:06:45,204
There are many communities

160
00:06:45,204 --> 00:06:47,239
That have a subterranean

161
00:06:47,239 --> 00:06:49,109
History, a house where

162
00:06:49,109 --> 00:06:51,545
Unspeakable things are said to

163
00:06:51,545 --> 00:06:53,914
Have happened, an institution

164
00:06:53,914 --> 00:06:56,917
Where people were...

165
00:06:56,917 --> 00:06:58,986
Segregated from the rest of

166
00:06:58,986 --> 00:07:01,454
Society.

167
00:07:01,454 --> 00:07:03,757
We got pictures of sea view.

168
00:07:03,757 --> 00:07:05,192
These are like overall,

169
00:07:05,192 --> 00:07:06,960
Bird's-eye view of, you know,

170
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:07,860
The hospital.

171
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:09,696
This included the tuberculosis

172
00:07:09,696 --> 00:07:10,230
Wards.

173
00:07:10,230 --> 00:07:11,999
This included tuberculosis

174
00:07:11,999 --> 00:07:12,565
Wards?

175
00:07:12,565 --> 00:07:13,166
Yes.

176
00:07:13,166 --> 00:07:14,967
And also on this property here

177
00:07:14,967 --> 00:07:16,804
Were a hospital for contagious

178
00:07:16,804 --> 00:07:18,539
Diseases, and then it got the

179
00:07:18,539 --> 00:07:20,139
Morgue and the cemetery.

180
00:07:20,139 --> 00:07:22,208
Well, this was across the street

181
00:07:22,208 --> 00:07:24,111
In the farm colony, which was

182
00:07:24,111 --> 00:07:25,946
Like a different part of the

183
00:07:25,946 --> 00:07:26,680
Hospital.

184
00:07:26,713 --> 00:07:28,881
They called it the "poor farm."

185
00:07:28,881 --> 00:07:30,518
Okay, here we have theor farm."

186
00:07:30,518 --> 00:07:31,985
Halloran hospital in

187
00:07:32,019 --> 00:07:33,053
Willowbrook.

188
00:07:33,053 --> 00:07:34,320
Right. It was halloran, and

189
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:35,187
Then it became the

190
00:07:35,187 --> 00:07:36,288
Willowbrook state school.

191
00:07:36,288 --> 00:07:36,856
Exactly.

192
00:07:36,856 --> 00:07:38,190
Willowbrook was strictly for

193
00:07:38,190 --> 00:07:38,959
The mentally ill?

194
00:07:38,992 --> 00:07:45,698
Yes.

195
00:07:45,698 --> 00:07:47,067
Back in 1972, the

196
00:07:47,067 --> 00:07:49,401
Willowbrook state school was the

197
00:07:49,401 --> 00:07:51,672
Subject of a famous exposé by a

198
00:07:51,672 --> 00:07:53,840
Young reporter looking for his

199
00:07:53,873 --> 00:07:56,909
Big break.

200
00:07:56,909 --> 00:07:58,111
I first heard of this big

201
00:07:58,111 --> 00:07:59,378
Place with the pretty-sounding

202
00:07:59,378 --> 00:08:00,446
Name because of a call I

203
00:08:00,446 --> 00:08:01,681
Received from a member of the

204
00:08:01,681 --> 00:08:02,583
Willowbrook staff, a

205
00:08:02,583 --> 00:08:03,783
Dr. Michael Wilkins.

206
00:08:03,783 --> 00:08:05,385
The doctor invited me to see

207
00:08:05,385 --> 00:08:07,020
The conditions he was talking

208
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:08,488
About, so unannounced and

209
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:09,890
Unexpected by the school

210
00:08:09,890 --> 00:08:11,324
Administration, we toured

211
00:08:11,324 --> 00:08:12,692
Building number six.

212
00:08:12,692 --> 00:08:14,694
The doctor had warned me that it

213
00:08:14,694 --> 00:08:15,662
Would be bad.

214
00:08:15,662 --> 00:08:16,797
It was horrible.

215
00:08:16,797 --> 00:08:18,532
There was one attendant for

216
00:08:18,532 --> 00:08:20,067
Perhaps 50 severely and

217
00:08:20,067 --> 00:08:21,901
Profoundly retarded children.

218
00:08:21,901 --> 00:08:23,703
Lying on the floor naked and

219
00:08:23,703 --> 00:08:25,539
Smeared with their own feces,

220
00:08:25,539 --> 00:08:27,206
They were making a pitiful

221
00:08:27,206 --> 00:08:29,109
Sound, a kind of mournful wail

222
00:08:29,109 --> 00:08:31,011
That it's impossible for me to

223
00:08:31,011 --> 00:08:32,546
Forget.

224
00:08:32,546 --> 00:08:34,114
This is what it looked like.

225
00:08:34,114 --> 00:08:35,748
This is what it sounded like.

226
00:08:35,748 --> 00:08:37,551
But how can I tell you about the

227
00:08:37,551 --> 00:08:38,484
Way it smelled?

228
00:08:38,484 --> 00:08:40,220
It smelled of filth, it smelled

229
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:41,854
Of disease, and it smelled of

230
00:08:41,854 --> 00:08:43,791
Death.

231
00:08:56,136 --> 00:08:58,004
Despite Geraldo's report, it

232
00:08:58,004 --> 00:08:59,740
Still took more than 10 years

233
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:00,540
Before authorities began

234
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:02,809
Shutting down willowbrook.

235
00:09:02,809 --> 00:09:04,612
Many patients were transferred

236
00:09:04,612 --> 00:09:06,478
To group homes, but others were

237
00:09:06,478 --> 00:09:08,381
Left to fend for themselves.

238
00:09:08,381 --> 00:09:10,517
There are those who believe that

239
00:09:10,517 --> 00:09:12,585
Some patients, out of confusion

240
00:09:12,585 --> 00:09:15,487
And habit, returned to the 365

241
00:09:15,487 --> 00:09:17,323
Acres of willowbrook to roam the

242
00:09:17,323 --> 00:09:19,092
Abandoned buildings and live in

243
00:09:19,092 --> 00:09:20,628
The tunnel system that lay

244
00:09:20,628 --> 00:09:22,962
Underneath.

245
00:09:22,962 --> 00:09:24,932
Out of this, our own version of

246
00:09:24,932 --> 00:09:27,434
The cropsey legend was born.

247
00:09:27,434 --> 00:09:28,901
At what point, though, in

248
00:09:28,901 --> 00:09:30,269
Your life did you start to

249
00:09:30,269 --> 00:09:31,872
Realize, "hey, maybe cropsey is"

250
00:09:31,872 --> 00:09:32,372
Real?"

251
00:09:32,372 --> 00:09:33,472
When kids started

252
00:09:33,472 --> 00:09:35,541
Disappearing from staten island.

253
00:09:35,541 --> 00:09:38,010
You're watching channel 7,

254
00:09:38,010 --> 00:09:39,545
Eyewitness news.

255
00:09:39,545 --> 00:09:40,714
Hi, guys. Listen.

256
00:09:40,714 --> 00:09:42,349
We need all the help we can to

257
00:09:42,349 --> 00:09:43,449
Help find Jennifer.

258
00:09:43,449 --> 00:09:45,085
The relentless search for a

259
00:09:45,085 --> 00:09:46,552
12-year-old girl with down

260
00:09:46,552 --> 00:09:48,155
Syndrome continues today as it

261
00:09:48,155 --> 00:09:49,757
Has for the last three weeks,

262
00:09:49,757 --> 00:09:51,423
With the hope that this will be

263
00:09:51,423 --> 00:09:52,458
The day they find

264
00:09:52,458 --> 00:09:54,393
Jennifer schweiger.

265
00:10:00,432 --> 00:10:02,535
She's very friendly, very

266
00:10:02,535 --> 00:10:04,036
Happy.

267
00:10:04,036 --> 00:10:06,473
She's a doll.

268
00:10:06,473 --> 00:10:08,775
Very loving.

269
00:10:08,775 --> 00:10:11,143
You know, that's a down syndrome

270
00:10:11,143 --> 00:10:12,445
Child's nature.

271
00:10:12,445 --> 00:10:13,713
Instead of lying in the sun

272
00:10:13,713 --> 00:10:15,082
Today, I figured I'd come out

273
00:10:15,082 --> 00:10:15,849
And just help.

274
00:10:15,849 --> 00:10:17,083
Could be one of our own

275
00:10:17,083 --> 00:10:18,418
Children, you know, that was

276
00:10:18,418 --> 00:10:21,354
Kidnapped or, you know, molested

277
00:10:21,387 --> 00:10:21,954
Anyways.

278
00:10:21,954 --> 00:10:23,490
Maybe it's Jennifer's added

279
00:10:23,490 --> 00:10:24,957
Vulnerability of having down

280
00:10:24,957 --> 00:10:26,226
Syndrome or possibly the

281
00:10:26,226 --> 00:10:27,427
Close-knit feelings of

282
00:10:27,427 --> 00:10:28,961
Staten islanders at having one

283
00:10:28,961 --> 00:10:30,497
Of their children missing, but

284
00:10:30,497 --> 00:10:31,799
Every day, more and more

285
00:10:31,799 --> 00:10:33,333
Volunteers turn out, searching

286
00:10:33,333 --> 00:10:34,835
Through the woods and hitting

287
00:10:34,835 --> 00:10:36,336
The streets, hoping to put an

288
00:10:36,336 --> 00:10:37,738
End to the schweiger family

289
00:10:37,738 --> 00:10:38,504
Ordeal.

290
00:10:38,504 --> 00:10:40,708
So many people turned out for

291
00:10:40,708 --> 00:10:41,809
This search.

292
00:10:41,809 --> 00:10:45,511
Everybody felt that...

293
00:10:45,511 --> 00:10:46,847
This was one of their own that

294
00:10:46,879 --> 00:10:48,480
Had disappeared.

295
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:50,116
They would show up at the

296
00:10:50,116 --> 00:10:51,884
Firehouse with flashlights,

297
00:10:51,884 --> 00:10:53,754
Ready to go into willowbrook,

298
00:10:53,754 --> 00:10:55,655
Willing to go into the forest,

299
00:10:55,655 --> 00:10:57,925
Into the tunnels underneath.

300
00:10:57,925 --> 00:10:59,458
There was one family in

301
00:10:59,458 --> 00:11:00,660
Particular, Donna cutugno, and

302
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:02,929
Some of her friends and

303
00:11:02,929 --> 00:11:04,563
Neighbors who had stepped

304
00:11:04,563 --> 00:11:06,734
Forward to organize searches.

305
00:11:06,734 --> 00:11:08,201
Today, we're concentrating on

306
00:11:08,201 --> 00:11:09,069
Willowbrook park.

307
00:11:09,069 --> 00:11:10,237
The police went in there

308
00:11:10,237 --> 00:11:11,404
Yesterday, and we're just

309
00:11:11,404 --> 00:11:12,872
Continuing where the police left

310
00:11:12,872 --> 00:11:13,240
Off.

311
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:14,674
This is what willowbrook looked

312
00:11:14,674 --> 00:11:15,909
Like when we were in here.

313
00:11:15,909 --> 00:11:17,376
I'll never forget the first time

314
00:11:17,376 --> 00:11:18,478
I went into one of these

315
00:11:18,510 --> 00:11:19,913
Buildings.

316
00:11:19,913 --> 00:11:21,548
It was really blood-curdling,

317
00:11:21,548 --> 00:11:23,283
Because here was the first time

318
00:11:23,283 --> 00:11:24,650
I was actually in these

319
00:11:24,650 --> 00:11:26,385
Buildings I heard these horrible

320
00:11:26,419 --> 00:11:27,887
Stories about.

321
00:11:27,887 --> 00:11:29,521
And as you walk through,

322
00:11:29,521 --> 00:11:30,724
Completely empty.

323
00:11:30,724 --> 00:11:32,591
You still hear, you feel it.

324
00:11:32,591 --> 00:11:34,261
You could almost feel the

325
00:11:34,261 --> 00:11:36,095
Children's presence there or

326
00:11:36,095 --> 00:11:38,398
The adults' presence there.

327
00:11:38,398 --> 00:11:41,835
And it's something you never get

328
00:11:41,835 --> 00:11:42,469
Used to.

329
00:11:42,469 --> 00:11:44,204
When you're looking, make sure

330
00:11:44,204 --> 00:11:45,839
You look down on the ground.

331
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:47,106
Look up in the trees.

332
00:11:47,106 --> 00:11:48,809
Anything you find, the police

333
00:11:48,809 --> 00:11:50,410
Can get a lot of information

334
00:11:50,410 --> 00:11:51,077
From it.

335
00:11:51,077 --> 00:11:52,846
In our searching, what we found

336
00:11:52,846 --> 00:11:54,815
Was a number of people that

337
00:11:54,815 --> 00:11:56,582
Actually lived here when

338
00:11:56,582 --> 00:11:58,752
Willowbrook was up and running

339
00:11:58,752 --> 00:12:00,720
And in full swing tend to come

340
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:01,822
Back here.

341
00:12:01,822 --> 00:12:04,023
So there was a whole...

342
00:12:04,023 --> 00:12:05,691
Underground of people that still

343
00:12:05,691 --> 00:12:07,326
Lived here, even though all the

344
00:12:07,326 --> 00:12:08,728
Buildings were closed, and

345
00:12:08,728 --> 00:12:10,097
Andre rand was definitely

346
00:12:10,097 --> 00:12:11,931
One of them.

347
00:12:11,931 --> 00:12:13,265
Andre rand worked as an

348
00:12:13,265 --> 00:12:14,101
Orderly at the

349
00:12:14,101 --> 00:12:15,568
Willowbrook state school from

350
00:12:15,568 --> 00:12:18,605
1966 to 1968.

351
00:12:18,605 --> 00:12:20,273
For years he lived in numerous

352
00:12:20,273 --> 00:12:22,008
Makeshift campsites in the woods

353
00:12:22,042 --> 00:12:24,210
Surrounding willowbrook.

354
00:12:24,210 --> 00:12:26,178
He was also the lead suspect in

355
00:12:26,178 --> 00:12:28,014
The Jennifer schweiger case.

356
00:12:28,014 --> 00:12:29,983
There was two witnesses that

357
00:12:29,983 --> 00:12:32,018
Stated that they saw her walking

358
00:12:32,018 --> 00:12:35,221
Along the street with a

359
00:12:35,221 --> 00:12:36,722
Middle-aged gentleman, and he

360
00:12:36,722 --> 00:12:38,291
Had a female green bike with a

361
00:12:38,325 --> 00:12:40,159
Basket on the front of it.

362
00:12:40,159 --> 00:12:42,061
The week before, I was in

363
00:12:42,061 --> 00:12:43,996
Shoprite, and I saw rand.

364
00:12:43,996 --> 00:12:46,165
I recognized him from a prior

365
00:12:46,165 --> 00:12:46,800
Case.

366
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:49,903
He purchased baby food, and he

367
00:12:49,903 --> 00:12:51,703
Got on a green female bike with

368
00:12:51,703 --> 00:12:53,040
A basket on the front.

369
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:54,606
At that point, bam, I said,

370
00:12:54,606 --> 00:12:55,442
"It's Andre.

371
00:12:55,442 --> 00:12:57,709
I saw him last week."

372
00:12:57,709 --> 00:12:59,346
Rand was immediately brought

373
00:12:59,346 --> 00:13:00,780
In and questioned in the girl's

374
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:02,615
Disappearance but released for

375
00:13:02,615 --> 00:13:03,616
Lack of evidence.

376
00:13:03,616 --> 00:13:05,318
After four weeks of surveillance

377
00:13:05,318 --> 00:13:06,820
In hopes of finding Jennifer

378
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:09,989
Alive, he was arrested.

379
00:13:09,989 --> 00:13:11,691
Rand had been familiar to police

380
00:13:11,691 --> 00:13:13,360
After pleading guilty to sexual

381
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:14,862
Misconduct with a 9-year-old

382
00:13:14,862 --> 00:13:17,865
Girl back in 1969... a crime

383
00:13:17,865 --> 00:13:20,333
Which he denied.

384
00:13:20,333 --> 00:13:21,368
Good afternoon.

385
00:13:21,368 --> 00:13:22,669
Here's what's happening.

386
00:13:22,669 --> 00:13:24,070
A homeless man, 43-year-old

387
00:13:24,070 --> 00:13:25,571
Andre rand, is under arrest.

388
00:13:25,571 --> 00:13:26,772
He is charged with the

389
00:13:26,772 --> 00:13:28,074
Kidnapping of 12-year-old

390
00:13:28,108 --> 00:13:29,008
Jennifer schweiger.

391
00:13:29,008 --> 00:13:30,343
The suspect was picked up last

392
00:13:30,343 --> 00:13:31,210
Night here at the

393
00:13:31,210 --> 00:13:32,345
Church of the God within.

394
00:13:32,345 --> 00:13:33,612
Police had questioned him as

395
00:13:33,612 --> 00:13:35,015
Early as the second day into the

396
00:13:35,015 --> 00:13:36,316
Investigation, and after four

397
00:13:36,316 --> 00:13:37,716
Weeks of a making a case against

398
00:13:37,716 --> 00:13:39,019
The man, they finally decided

399
00:13:39,019 --> 00:13:40,087
They had enough to get a

400
00:13:40,119 --> 00:13:41,521
Conviction.

401
00:13:41,521 --> 00:13:43,255
I've never seen a perp walk like

402
00:13:43,255 --> 00:13:43,722
That.

403
00:13:43,722 --> 00:13:45,425
Watching him coming out looking

404
00:13:45,425 --> 00:13:47,961
Like he had lost his mind

405
00:13:47,961 --> 00:13:50,830
Further angered people in the

406
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:51,865
Community.

407
00:13:51,865 --> 00:13:53,967
That image forced a lot of

408
00:13:53,967 --> 00:13:56,135
People to say, "that is the"

409
00:13:56,135 --> 00:13:56,937
Killer.

410
00:13:56,937 --> 00:13:58,770
That man is not right.

411
00:13:58,770 --> 00:14:00,840
"Look at him there, drooling."

412
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:03,410
And it certainly caused me to

413
00:14:03,410 --> 00:14:05,011
Ask a lot of questions.

414
00:14:05,011 --> 00:14:06,312
Who is Andre rand?

415
00:14:06,312 --> 00:14:08,181
Did they get a crazy man and

416
00:14:08,181 --> 00:14:10,083
Just say he's the guy, or did

417
00:14:10,083 --> 00:14:12,085
They really have good evidence

418
00:14:12,085 --> 00:14:14,087
Against him that would stick in

419
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:15,355
A court?

420
00:14:15,355 --> 00:14:16,689
I used to teach the

421
00:14:16,689 --> 00:14:17,990
Andre rand story in my

422
00:14:17,990 --> 00:14:19,092
Journalism class.

423
00:14:19,092 --> 00:14:20,692
Coming down the steps of the

424
00:14:20,692 --> 00:14:22,229
Courthouse with a headline,

425
00:14:22,261 --> 00:14:24,031
"Drifter arrested."

426
00:14:24,031 --> 00:14:25,432
Well, what does that mean?

427
00:14:25,432 --> 00:14:26,698
It means guilty, right?

428
00:14:26,698 --> 00:14:28,200
Whether he is or not, I don't

429
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,701
Know the whole story either.

430
00:14:29,701 --> 00:14:31,270
But it's a lot easier to do it

431
00:14:31,270 --> 00:14:32,906
That way than to say, "you know"

432
00:14:32,906 --> 00:14:33,339
What?

433
00:14:33,339 --> 00:14:34,840
It might be somebody on your

434
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:35,375
"Block."

435
00:14:35,375 --> 00:14:36,143
[ Chuckles ]

436
00:14:36,143 --> 00:14:37,709
"It might be somebody you work

437
00:14:37,709 --> 00:14:39,311
With."

438
00:14:39,311 --> 00:14:40,679
Did you ever think that

439
00:14:40,679 --> 00:14:42,082
Anybody else was involved?

440
00:14:42,082 --> 00:14:43,650
Well, we always had to think

441
00:14:43,650 --> 00:14:45,317
There was somebody else until we

442
00:14:45,317 --> 00:14:46,553
Could just rule it out.

443
00:14:46,553 --> 00:14:47,753
You know, you always have to

444
00:14:47,753 --> 00:14:48,956
Keep that in the back of your

445
00:14:48,956 --> 00:14:49,321
Mind.

446
00:14:49,321 --> 00:14:51,091
And plus, by going by our

447
00:14:51,091 --> 00:14:52,993
Witnesses, if you consider our

448
00:14:52,993 --> 00:14:54,928
Witnesses credible, it was only

449
00:14:54,928 --> 00:14:56,228
Andre and Jennifer.

450
00:14:56,228 --> 00:14:59,198
There was no other person.

451
00:14:59,198 --> 00:15:00,900
Of course, when we had him

452
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:03,036
For the 26 hours, where was she?

453
00:15:03,036 --> 00:15:04,904
Did he leave her with somebody

454
00:15:04,904 --> 00:15:06,406
Else?

455
00:15:06,406 --> 00:15:07,975
With rand's arrest, the

456
00:15:07,975 --> 00:15:09,541
Search for Jennifer turned

457
00:15:09,541 --> 00:15:10,310
Desperate.

458
00:15:10,310 --> 00:15:11,878
Rumors were spreading that

459
00:15:11,878 --> 00:15:13,445
Someone, maybe even one of

460
00:15:13,445 --> 00:15:15,014
Rand's friends, was hiding

461
00:15:15,014 --> 00:15:16,816
Jennifer and moving her late at

462
00:15:16,816 --> 00:15:18,350
Night through the tunnels

463
00:15:18,350 --> 00:15:19,751
Underneath willowbrook.

464
00:15:19,751 --> 00:15:21,120
I want my daughter.

465
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:22,888
I want the man to talk.

466
00:15:23,790 --> 00:15:25,691
I want him just to tell us where

467
00:15:25,725 --> 00:15:27,727
Jennifer is.

468
00:15:27,727 --> 00:15:29,328
Despite constant threats by

469
00:15:29,328 --> 00:15:30,862
State officials to stay away

470
00:15:30,862 --> 00:15:32,532
From willowbrook, Donna and the

471
00:15:32,532 --> 00:15:34,134
Friends of Jennifer kept going

472
00:15:34,134 --> 00:15:35,801
Back.

473
00:15:35,801 --> 00:15:37,836
This area had been covered

474
00:15:37,836 --> 00:15:39,405
Thousands of times by

475
00:15:39,405 --> 00:15:41,574
Volunteers, by police, by dogs.

476
00:15:41,574 --> 00:15:43,775
But in that time, one gentleman

477
00:15:43,775 --> 00:15:45,677
Came across an area that he

478
00:15:45,677 --> 00:15:47,679
Noticed had Clay balls up on

479
00:15:47,679 --> 00:15:49,415
Top, like someone patted down.

480
00:15:49,415 --> 00:15:51,218
And then this was all, you know,

481
00:15:51,218 --> 00:15:53,053
Pushed back over with the trees.

482
00:15:53,053 --> 00:15:54,753
It was just a little spot that

483
00:15:54,753 --> 00:15:56,288
He noticed the Clay balls.

484
00:15:56,288 --> 00:15:58,091
And that's what made us go back,

485
00:15:58,091 --> 00:15:59,791
Or made him insist that we go

486
00:15:59,791 --> 00:16:00,259
Back.

487
00:16:00,259 --> 00:16:00,960
And George showed us the

488
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:06,166
Location that he thought...

489
00:16:06,166 --> 00:16:11,603
Needed to be looked at.

490
00:16:11,603 --> 00:16:13,005
The smell... as soon as you

491
00:16:13,005 --> 00:16:16,075
Start digging...

492
00:16:16,075 --> 00:16:20,179
We saw her toes.

493
00:16:20,179 --> 00:16:24,217
And everybody stopped.

494
00:16:24,217 --> 00:16:25,617
Father Henry gave her last

495
00:16:25,617 --> 00:16:27,554
Rites.

496
00:16:36,462 --> 00:16:37,796
And they took us out of the

497
00:16:37,796 --> 00:16:38,864
Woods.

498
00:16:38,864 --> 00:16:40,232
Ernie, a grisly discovery

499
00:16:40,232 --> 00:16:41,733
Back here tonight, back here in

500
00:16:41,733 --> 00:16:42,769
The 384 acres of the

501
00:16:42,769 --> 00:16:44,104
Staten island developmental

502
00:16:44,104 --> 00:16:45,371
Center... an arm and a leg

503
00:16:45,371 --> 00:16:46,706
Sticking out from a shallow

504
00:16:46,706 --> 00:16:47,174
Grave.

505
00:16:47,174 --> 00:16:48,608
They are eerie shadows, police

506
00:16:48,608 --> 00:16:50,009
And others at the scene where

507
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:51,178
The body of 12-year-old

508
00:16:51,178 --> 00:16:52,679
Jennifer Lynn schweiger tonight

509
00:16:52,679 --> 00:16:53,912
Was found.

510
00:16:53,912 --> 00:16:55,347
Police were preventing anyone

511
00:16:55,347 --> 00:16:56,848
From getting this close to the

512
00:16:56,848 --> 00:16:57,316
Scene.

513
00:16:57,316 --> 00:16:58,817
Even Jennifer's father is kept

514
00:16:58,817 --> 00:16:59,251
Away.

515
00:16:59,251 --> 00:17:00,653
Yeah, Jennifer's father's

516
00:17:00,653 --> 00:17:01,020
Here.

517
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:02,622
He says you gave him permission

518
00:17:02,622 --> 00:17:03,490
To come through?

519
00:17:03,490 --> 00:17:04,823
Unless they can walk on

520
00:17:04,823 --> 00:17:07,993
Water, they stay outside.

521
00:17:07,993 --> 00:17:09,262
There are two other girls

522
00:17:09,262 --> 00:17:10,497
Who, over the last couple of

523
00:17:10,497 --> 00:17:11,797
Years, have turned up missing

524
00:17:11,797 --> 00:17:12,832
Here on staten island.

525
00:17:12,832 --> 00:17:14,233
They will be searching this area

526
00:17:14,233 --> 00:17:15,634
In the next few days to see what

527
00:17:15,634 --> 00:17:16,369
They can find.

528
00:17:16,369 --> 00:17:17,637
As one police officer told us

529
00:17:17,637 --> 00:17:18,937
Tonight, God knows what they

530
00:17:18,937 --> 00:17:20,172
Can find here.

531
00:17:20,172 --> 00:17:22,342
The discovery of Jennifer's

532
00:17:22,342 --> 00:17:24,544
Body only 150 yards from rand's

533
00:17:24,544 --> 00:17:26,646
Campsite confirmed everyone's

534
00:17:26,646 --> 00:17:27,946
Worst nightmare.

535
00:17:27,946 --> 00:17:29,981
Residents were outraged, and

536
00:17:29,981 --> 00:17:31,517
They wanted justice.

537
00:17:31,517 --> 00:17:33,720
The district attorney, however,

538
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:35,887
Had no physical evidence tying

539
00:17:35,887 --> 00:17:37,423
Rand with Jennifer's

540
00:17:37,423 --> 00:17:38,591
Disappearance.

541
00:17:38,591 --> 00:17:40,560
The case was relying almost

542
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:42,229
Entirely on eyewitness

543
00:17:42,229 --> 00:17:44,331
Testimony, which most experts

544
00:17:44,331 --> 00:17:48,235
Agree is often unreliable.

545
00:17:48,235 --> 00:17:50,369
After the largest criminal trial

546
00:17:50,369 --> 00:17:52,371
In staten island history, rand

547
00:17:52,371 --> 00:17:57,409
Was convicted of kidnapping.

548
00:17:57,409 --> 00:17:58,611
But the murder charge was

549
00:17:58,611 --> 00:18:00,079
Dismissed after jurors couldn't

550
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:03,515
Reach a verdict.

551
00:18:03,515 --> 00:18:05,684
Rand was sentenced 25 years to

552
00:18:05,684 --> 00:18:07,854
Life and would be eligible for

553
00:18:07,854 --> 00:18:09,788
Parole in 2008.

554
00:18:17,764 --> 00:18:19,832
Staten islanders like to find

555
00:18:19,832 --> 00:18:21,701
Easy scapegoats, but not the

556
00:18:21,701 --> 00:18:22,534
Real ones.

557
00:18:22,534 --> 00:18:24,503
And we don't want to think too

558
00:18:24,503 --> 00:18:26,606
Deeply about what this means for

559
00:18:26,606 --> 00:18:27,539
Our society.

560
00:18:27,539 --> 00:18:29,476
When you look at a place like

561
00:18:29,476 --> 00:18:31,478
Staten island, it was viewed as

562
00:18:31,478 --> 00:18:33,445
A dumping ground for all kinds

563
00:18:33,445 --> 00:18:34,314
Of things.

564
00:18:34,314 --> 00:18:36,316
The fresh kills landfill, which

565
00:18:36,316 --> 00:18:38,185
Took all the city's garbage,

566
00:18:38,185 --> 00:18:39,985
8 million people's garbage,

567
00:18:39,985 --> 00:18:41,788
Dumped in staten island.

568
00:18:41,788 --> 00:18:43,790
The farm colony was a place

569
00:18:43,790 --> 00:18:45,658
Where people went who had

570
00:18:45,658 --> 00:18:46,759
Tuberculosis.

571
00:18:46,759 --> 00:18:49,094
Willowbrook warehoused thousands

572
00:18:49,094 --> 00:18:51,264
Of people and left them there.

573
00:18:51,264 --> 00:18:53,064
It was a dumping ground.

574
00:18:53,064 --> 00:18:54,065
Why would you dump them in

575
00:18:54,065 --> 00:18:54,701
Staten island?

576
00:18:54,701 --> 00:18:55,768

Dumping kids to staten island.

Right?

It's more about the undercurrent

00:19:29,202 --> 00:19:32,839
That cannot be tamed by building

589
00:19:32,871 --> 00:19:35,442
Or organization.

590
00:19:35,442 --> 00:19:37,142
You put a bunch of people that

Bunch of people that are

"Wonderful place?"

604

Undercurrents, those things that

606
00:19:58,465 --> 00:20:00,532
Had come before.

607
00:20:00,532 --> 00:20:01,200

By our parents' belief that

609

Four different cases spanning

768
00:25:02,701 --> 00:25:04,470

00:25:05,004 --> 00:25:06,873
It's like the whole community

771
00:25:06,873 --> 00:25:08,841
Was just thrown into chaos over

772
00:25:08,841 --> 00:25:09,375
This.

773
00:25:09,375 --> 00:25:11,077
You know, here's this guy,

774
00:25:11,077 --> 00:25:13,111
Allegedly, going around, picking

775
00:25:13,111 --> 00:25:14,847
Off these kids.

776
00:25:14,847 --> 00:25:16,482

About this guy, and the media,

779
00:25:20,186 --> 00:25:22,088
You know, have painted him as an

780
00:25:22,088 --> 00:25:25,156
Absolute fucking monster.

781
00:25:25,156 --> 00:25:27,627
And he may very well be.

782
00:25:27,627 --> 00:25:28,695
There's no physical or

783
00:25:28,695 --> 00:25:30,096
Scientific evidence that I know

784
00:25:30,096 --> 00:25:31,797
Of in this case.

785
00:25:31,797 --> 00:25:33,464
There's no body.

786
00:25:33,464 --> 00:25:35,735
They haven't found her.

787
00:25:35,735 --> 00:25:37,670
It's all circumstantial.

788
00:25:39,370 --> 00:25:40,607
They've gone.

789
00:25:40,607 --> 00:25:42,208
They've dug up graves.

790
00:25:42,208 --> 00:25:43,875
They've gone to his old

791
00:25:43,875 --> 00:25:45,476
Neighborhood.

792
00:25:45,476 --> 00:25:47,213
They searched his car.

793
00:25:47,213 --> 00:25:49,514
There's nothing that's come up.

794
00:25:49,514 --> 00:25:51,550
So I'm completely confident

795
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:53,653
That, you know, he didn't do

796
00:25:53,653 --> 00:25:54,186
This.

797
00:25:54,186 --> 00:25:56,055
So why do you think the d.A.

798
00:25:56,055 --> 00:25:57,488
Is pursuing this case?

804
00:26:05,197 --> 00:26:07,099
Wanted to put this baby to rest

805
00:26:07,099 --> 00:26:09,802
Before he left office.

806
00:26:16,909 --> 00:26:19,178
I remember the inadequacies

00:26:19,178 --> 00:26:21,479
Of the witness' statements back

808
00:26:21,479 --> 00:26:24,549
In 1981 and 1982.

809

Some of them were out-and-out

811
00:26:29,921 --> 00:26:32,692
Clear recollections of what was

812
00:26:32,692 --> 00:26:35,526
Going on from day to day, but in

813
00:26:35,526 --> 00:26:38,130
Recovery, their memories were

814
00:26:38,130 --> 00:26:39,231
Improved.

That the Andre rand story is

816
00:26:41,868 --> 00:26:44,704
Being told is simply an example

817
00:26:44,704 --> 00:26:47,538
Of what can be done if people

818
00:26:47,538 --> 00:26:49,007
Remain vigilant, remain

To find evidence of the other

I don't know where she would be.

840

00:31:18,309 --> 00:31:18,945
Her home.

958
00:31:18,945 --> 00:31:20,546
A clerk says she came in at 9:30

959
00:31:20,546 --> 00:31:22,048
Wednesday night with 27 cents

960
00:31:22,048 --> 00:31:23,781
And bought a bar of soap.

961
00:31:23,781 --> 00:31:24,984
She's a quiet girl, you know?

962
00:31:24,984 --> 00:31:25,952
She didn't say nothing to

963
00:31:25,952 --> 00:31:26,317
Nobody.

964
00:31:26,317 --> 00:31:27,453
And she just got her thing and

965
00:31:27,453 --> 00:31:27,785
Left.

966
00:31:27,785 --> 00:31:28,719
I really don't know what

967
00:31:28,719 --> 00:31:29,720
Happened after that.

968
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:31,022
I worked in the deli there.

969
00:31:31,022 --> 00:31:31,789
Girl comes in.

970
00:31:31,789 --> 00:31:32,992
Who? Holly Ann Hughes?

971
00:31:32,992 --> 00:31:33,960
Holly Ann. Yeah.

972
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:35,360
She came in. When was this?

973
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:36,261
This was in 1981.

974
00:31:36,261 --> 00:31:37,328
1981.

975
00:31:37,328 --> 00:31:39,130
She went to buy a bar of soap.

976
00:31:39,130 --> 00:31:40,865
The bar of soap was 31 cents.

977
00:31:40,865 --> 00:31:42,034
Why do I remember?

978
00:31:42,034 --> 00:31:43,634
Because she was short four

979
00:31:43,634 --> 00:31:44,036
Cents.

980
00:31:44,036 --> 00:31:45,336
And the old man working behind

981
00:31:45,336 --> 00:31:46,737
The counter, he wouldn't give it

982
00:31:46,737 --> 00:31:47,173
To her.

983
00:31:47,173 --> 00:31:50,375
That's why I remember.

984
00:31:50,375 --> 00:31:51,809
When I seen his picture, I said,

985
00:31:51,809 --> 00:31:52,945
"Yeah, I've seen that guy"

986
00:31:52,945 --> 00:31:53,412
Before.

987
00:31:53,412 --> 00:31:54,779
You know, he's like a quiet guy

988
00:31:54,779 --> 00:31:55,414
To himself.

989
00:31:55,414 --> 00:31:56,415
"He don't look right."

990
00:31:56,415 --> 00:31:57,715
Like I think he talked with a

991
00:31:57,715 --> 00:31:59,051
Speech impediment, but I'm not

992
00:31:59,051 --> 00:31:59,485
Sure.

993
00:31:59,485 --> 00:32:00,851
And did anybody else ever

994
00:32:00,851 --> 00:32:01,852
Disappear from that

995
00:32:01,852 --> 00:32:01,920
Neighborhood?

996
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:03,789
Yeah. Hank gafforio.

997
00:32:03,789 --> 00:32:05,190
Looked just like Mick Jagger.

998
00:32:05,190 --> 00:32:06,292
Disappeared from that

999
00:32:06,292 --> 00:32:07,025
Neighborhood.

1000
00:32:07,025 --> 00:32:08,194
How long afterwards?

1001
00:32:08,194 --> 00:32:09,128
The same time.

1002
00:32:09,128 --> 00:32:10,461
He was a little slow... Hank.

1003
00:32:10,461 --> 00:32:11,797
His brother swears that

1004
00:32:11,797 --> 00:32:13,732
Andre rand killed him.

1005
00:32:19,805 --> 00:32:21,240
They came to me all those

1006
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:21,839
Years ago.

1007
00:32:21,872 --> 00:32:23,976
But that was 18 years ago.

1008
00:32:23,976 --> 00:32:25,143
And they said, "we need some"

1009
00:32:25,143 --> 00:32:25,544
Help."

1010
00:32:25,544 --> 00:32:26,678
He was supposedly at the

1011
00:32:26,678 --> 00:32:27,946
Diner at like 3:00, 4:00 in the

1012
00:32:27,946 --> 00:32:29,048
Morning with rand.

1013
00:32:29,048 --> 00:32:30,381
A handful of people came

1014
00:32:30,381 --> 00:32:32,150
Forward... a handful... handful.

1015
00:32:32,150 --> 00:32:33,552
And, again, he was older.

1016
00:32:33,552 --> 00:32:35,221
You know, that had a lot to do

1017
00:32:35,221 --> 00:32:35,820
With it.

1018
00:32:35,820 --> 00:32:39,290
He was 21.

1019
00:32:39,290 --> 00:32:40,391
We were watching this

1020
00:32:40,391 --> 00:32:41,692
Reporter standing in front of

1021
00:32:41,692 --> 00:32:42,961
Holly Ann Hughes' house, and

1022
00:32:42,961 --> 00:32:44,096
Right off her shoulder is

1023
00:32:44,096 --> 00:32:45,796
Hank gafforio.

1024
00:32:45,796 --> 00:32:47,133
It'd be funny to see him pop

1025
00:32:47,133 --> 00:32:48,034
Up in one of these.

1026
00:32:48,034 --> 00:32:49,267
We just want you to bring

1027
00:32:49,267 --> 00:32:53,072
Holly home.

1028
00:32:53,072 --> 00:32:53,938
[ Sobbing ]

1029
00:32:53,938 --> 00:32:55,906
The two days since holly Ann

1030
00:32:55,906 --> 00:32:56,941
Disappeared...

1031
00:32:56,941 --> 00:33:00,211
There. That's Hank gafforio.

1032
00:33:00,211 --> 00:33:01,980
Right there?

1033
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:03,782
Yeah.

1034
00:33:03,782 --> 00:33:10,789
That number again, 987-7935.

1035
00:33:10,789 --> 00:33:12,391
Too many coincidences, you

1036
00:33:12,391 --> 00:33:12,858
Know?

1037
00:33:12,858 --> 00:33:14,493
And like I said, before I die,

1038
00:33:14,493 --> 00:33:16,094
I would love this guy to just

1039
00:33:16,094 --> 00:33:17,363
Talk to me, just once.

1040
00:33:17,363 --> 00:33:18,997
And all he's got to do is just

1041
00:33:18,997 --> 00:33:20,566
Give somebody a note and say,

1042
00:33:20,566 --> 00:33:22,267
"This is where they're buried."

1043
00:33:22,267 --> 00:33:27,005
That's all.

1044
00:33:27,005 --> 00:33:29,041
He sent us, I think, I guess

1045
00:33:29,041 --> 00:33:30,775
The view from his window.

1046
00:33:30,775 --> 00:33:32,744
This is the decision and order

1047
00:33:32,744 --> 00:33:34,012
From the judge...

1048
00:33:34,012 --> 00:33:35,281
In the case of

1049
00:33:35,281 --> 00:33:36,615
Jennifer schweiger?

1050
00:33:36,615 --> 00:33:37,716
No, no, no.

1051
00:33:37,716 --> 00:33:39,250
This is in the case of

1052
00:33:39,250 --> 00:33:40,086
Holly Ann.

1053
00:33:40,086 --> 00:33:42,121
So he's basically responding

1054
00:33:42,121 --> 00:33:44,190
To each of the witnesses in the

1055
00:33:44,190 --> 00:33:45,756
Last pretrial hearings.

1056
00:33:45,756 --> 00:33:47,059
Testimony, right.

1057
00:33:47,059 --> 00:33:48,859
It says, "detective lotito asked"

1058
00:33:48,859 --> 00:33:50,395
The defendant if he noticed

1059
00:33:50,395 --> 00:33:51,697
Anything unusual about

1060
00:33:51,697 --> 00:33:53,331
Holly Ann Hughes at the time.

1061
00:33:53,331 --> 00:33:54,932
The defendant said, 'she was

1062
00:33:54,932 --> 00:33:56,000
Very, very dirty.

1063
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,203
Her legs were dirty.

1064
00:33:57,203 --> 00:33:58,503
Her hands were dirty.'

1065
00:33:58,503 --> 00:34:00,206
He gave her money and sent her

1066
00:34:00,206 --> 00:34:01,839
To the grocery store to buy a

1067
00:34:01,839 --> 00:34:02,040
Bar of soap.

1068
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:04,776
The court here is continuously

1069
00:34:04,776 --> 00:34:06,511
Quoting the detectives' own

1070
00:34:06,511 --> 00:34:07,913
Invented statements.

1071
00:34:07,913 --> 00:34:09,881
The defendant never met or saw

1072
00:34:09,881 --> 00:34:11,917
Hughes at any time, nor did the

1073
00:34:11,917 --> 00:34:14,286
"Defendant admit these things."

1074
00:34:28,667 --> 00:34:30,501
The only witness today was

1075
00:34:30,501 --> 00:34:31,570
Elsie Castro.

1076
00:34:31,570 --> 00:34:33,771
She lived across the street from

1077
00:34:33,771 --> 00:34:35,373
Where holly Ann lived.

1078
00:34:35,373 --> 00:34:37,276
She says on her side of the

1079
00:34:37,276 --> 00:34:39,043
Street, but one house up,

1080
00:34:39,043 --> 00:34:40,311
There's a green volkswagen.

1081
00:34:40,311 --> 00:34:41,680
She doesn't see anybody in the

1082
00:34:41,680 --> 00:34:42,547
Green volkswagen.

1083
00:34:42,547 --> 00:34:43,715
She goes into the house.

1084
00:34:43,715 --> 00:34:45,049
She goes to take a shower and

1085
00:34:45,049 --> 00:34:47,153
Discovers that there's no soap.

1086
00:34:47,153 --> 00:34:48,620
Larry interviewed

1087
00:34:48,620 --> 00:34:49,655
Elsie Castro.

1088
00:34:49,655 --> 00:34:52,158
She saw nothing.

1089
00:34:52,158 --> 00:34:53,891
But she claims she bought a

1090
00:34:53,891 --> 00:34:55,893
Bar of soap at the store and was

1091
00:34:55,893 --> 00:34:57,095
Five cents short.

1092
00:34:57,095 --> 00:34:58,963
It's very coincidental that

1093
00:34:58,963 --> 00:35:00,699
She was a nickel short when

1094
00:35:00,699 --> 00:35:02,100
Holly Ann was reportedly a

1095
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:04,069
Nickel short, as well, all

1096
00:35:04,069 --> 00:35:06,071
Within the time span of about an

1097
00:35:06,071 --> 00:35:06,505
Hour.

1098
00:35:06,505 --> 00:35:08,006
So do you think the other

1099
00:35:08,006 --> 00:35:09,207
Witness misremembered?

1100
00:35:09,207 --> 00:35:10,141
I don't know.

1101
00:35:10,141 --> 00:35:11,742
And what that says, if I don't

1102
00:35:11,742 --> 00:35:13,345
Know and the jury doesn't know,

1103
00:35:13,345 --> 00:35:14,879
That's reasonable doubt.

1104
00:35:14,879 --> 00:35:16,348
This is Elsie's car.

1105
00:35:16,348 --> 00:35:17,483
Elsie Castro.

1106
00:35:17,483 --> 00:35:18,217
Right.

1107
00:35:18,217 --> 00:35:19,718
Here, the kids were all back and

1108
00:35:19,718 --> 00:35:20,652
Forth around here.

1109
00:35:20,652 --> 00:35:21,586
On that corner.

1110
00:35:21,586 --> 00:35:23,020
And where was the actual point

1111
00:35:23,020 --> 00:35:24,322
Where they believed she was

1112
00:35:24,322 --> 00:35:24,790
Taken?

1113
00:35:24,790 --> 00:35:26,056
Well, this is the other

1114
00:35:26,056 --> 00:35:26,492
Thing.

1115
00:35:26,492 --> 00:35:29,894
We're not sure. Look at that.

1116
00:35:29,894 --> 00:35:30,996
A volkswagen.

1117
00:35:30,996 --> 00:35:33,131
He came back to see what was

1118
00:35:33,165 --> 00:35:34,766
Going on.

1119
00:35:34,766 --> 00:35:37,602
All of the crimes that we seem

1120
00:35:37,602 --> 00:35:40,571
To link him to all took place in

1121
00:35:40,571 --> 00:35:43,141
July, with the exception of

1122
00:35:43,175 --> 00:35:44,575
Tiahease.

1123
00:35:44,575 --> 00:35:47,512
This was tiahease... tai.

1124
00:35:58,190 --> 00:36:00,124
She lived with her mother, and I

1125
00:36:00,124 --> 00:36:01,927
Believe there were four other

1126
00:36:01,927 --> 00:36:03,762
Siblings, and they were all in

1127
00:36:03,762 --> 00:36:05,497
One room in the conca d'oro.

1128
00:36:05,497 --> 00:36:07,265
It was a welfare hotel at the

1129
00:36:07,265 --> 00:36:08,800
Particular time.

1130
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:11,269
It was an August day, and the

1131
00:36:11,269 --> 00:36:13,604
Older brother left tiahease

1132
00:36:13,604 --> 00:36:15,206
Talking to a man.

1133
00:36:15,206 --> 00:36:17,409
That man was described as

1134
00:36:17,409 --> 00:36:20,144
Someone that looked like Andre.

1135
00:36:20,144 --> 00:36:22,580
She's never been seen again.

1136
00:36:22,580 --> 00:36:24,949
The evidence is the bodies.

1137
00:36:24,949 --> 00:36:27,618
I'm sure buried somewhere, he's

1138
00:36:27,618 --> 00:36:29,221
Got the evidence.

1139
00:36:29,221 --> 00:36:31,889
We just haven't found it in the

1140
00:36:31,889 --> 00:36:34,158
Woods yet.

1141
00:36:34,158 --> 00:36:36,262
Sniff it out.

1142
00:36:36,262 --> 00:36:37,229
Whatcha got, boy?

1143
00:36:37,229 --> 00:36:38,697
Donna is searching one of

1144
00:36:38,697 --> 00:36:40,164
Rand's former campsites with

1145
00:36:40,164 --> 00:36:41,666
Luis Rivera, a retired police

1146
00:36:41,666 --> 00:36:43,201
Officer who helped search for

1147
00:36:43,201 --> 00:36:44,303
Jennifer the day she

1148
00:36:44,303 --> 00:36:48,774
Disappeared.

1149
00:36:48,774 --> 00:36:50,976
Find the body, boy.

1150
00:36:50,976 --> 00:36:51,810
Find the body.

1151
00:36:51,810 --> 00:36:52,577
Sniff it out.

1152
00:36:52,577 --> 00:36:54,380
Sniff it out.

1153
00:36:54,380 --> 00:36:55,847
One body that I found with my

1154
00:36:55,847 --> 00:36:58,048
Dog was 22 years in the ground.

1155
00:36:58,048 --> 00:37:00,486
So the possibilities are really

1156
00:37:00,486 --> 00:37:01,219
There.

1157
00:37:01,219 --> 00:37:03,421
It's just a matter of coming

1158
00:37:03,421 --> 00:37:05,924
Back out, concentrating on small

1159
00:37:05,924 --> 00:37:08,860
Areas at a time.

1160
00:37:08,860 --> 00:37:09,827
Come on, boy.

1161
00:37:09,827 --> 00:37:10,796
Come on, boy.

1162
00:37:10,796 --> 00:37:11,762
Sniff it out.

1163
00:37:11,762 --> 00:37:12,798
Find the body, boy.

1164
00:37:12,798 --> 00:37:14,265
Where do you think most of

1165
00:37:14,265 --> 00:37:15,133
These kids are?

1166
00:37:15,133 --> 00:37:16,867
It's hard to say.

1167
00:37:16,867 --> 00:37:19,538
They're buried...

1168
00:37:19,538 --> 00:37:21,840
Somewhere in staten island.

1169
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:23,475
Detective Frank saez is one

1170
00:37:23,475 --> 00:37:25,075
Of the foremost experts on the

1171
00:37:25,075 --> 00:37:26,677
Cold cases of New York City's

1172
00:37:26,677 --> 00:37:27,678
Missing children.

1173
00:37:27,678 --> 00:37:29,213
I mean, he could come and

1174
00:37:29,213 --> 00:37:32,717
Say, "listen," someday, "I'll

1175
00:37:32,717 --> 00:37:34,485
"Give you the bodies," and take

1176
00:37:34,485 --> 00:37:36,355
You to a location, and you could

1177
00:37:36,355 --> 00:37:39,525
Be shocked where it's at.

1178
00:37:39,525 --> 00:37:40,959
If you look around, you can

1179
00:37:40,959 --> 00:37:42,328
Actually see the perimeter of

1180
00:37:42,328 --> 00:37:42,961
This area.

1181
00:37:42,961 --> 00:37:44,094
And this was one of his

1182
00:37:44,094 --> 00:37:45,030
Campsites.

1183
00:37:45,030 --> 00:37:47,197
This did not have a lean-to or

1184
00:37:47,197 --> 00:37:49,468
A latrine or anything set up the

1185
00:37:49,468 --> 00:37:51,702
Way the campsite at willowbrook

1186
00:37:51,702 --> 00:37:53,939
Did, but kids did say that they

1187
00:37:53,939 --> 00:37:56,106
Would see him sitting in here.

1188
00:37:56,106 --> 00:37:58,276
So, this was where he lived in

1189
00:37:58,276 --> 00:38:00,645
The warmer months.

1190
00:38:00,645 --> 00:38:02,280
Seek it out.

1191
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:04,783
Seek it out, boy.

1192
00:38:04,783 --> 00:38:07,017
They say the death of a child

1193
00:38:07,017 --> 00:38:08,920
Is the worst possible crime

1194
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:10,721
Anybody can ever imagine.

1195
00:38:10,721 --> 00:38:11,857
Absolutely.

1196
00:38:11,857 --> 00:38:13,891
But the missing of a child is

1197
00:38:13,891 --> 00:38:15,826
Even worse, because if your

1198
00:38:15,826 --> 00:38:17,928
Child dies and you bury him or

1199
00:38:17,928 --> 00:38:19,965
Her, then at least you have a

1200
00:38:19,965 --> 00:38:21,932
Place that you can go to.

1201
00:38:21,932 --> 00:38:24,234
When your child disappears and

1202
00:38:24,234 --> 00:38:26,605
You don't know where that child

1203
00:38:26,605 --> 00:38:28,706
Is, to a parent, a child is

1204
00:38:28,706 --> 00:38:31,075
Never dead until an officer can

1205
00:38:31,075 --> 00:38:33,311
Actually bring the remains to

1206
00:38:33,311 --> 00:38:35,514
Them.

1207
00:38:35,514 --> 00:38:37,147
Somebody's using this area

1208
00:38:37,147 --> 00:38:37,615
Here.

1209
00:38:37,615 --> 00:38:39,183
See, when you find things

1210
00:38:39,183 --> 00:38:42,821
Like articles of clothing, like

1211
00:38:42,821 --> 00:38:46,358
This is a kid's shoe, shampoo,

1212
00:38:46,358 --> 00:38:50,127
Tape...

1213
00:38:50,127 --> 00:38:51,796
Luis!

1214
00:38:51,796 --> 00:38:53,230
Come on back.

1215
00:38:53,230 --> 00:38:55,232
Okay, there's shoes, duct tape,

1216
00:38:55,232 --> 00:39:00,439
And look how soft the ground is.

1217
00:39:00,439 --> 00:39:01,973
It's real soft.

1218
00:39:01,973 --> 00:39:02,340
Yeah.

1219
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:05,043
Sniff it out.

1220
00:39:05,043 --> 00:39:07,713
Sniff it out, boy.

1221
00:39:07,713 --> 00:39:12,250
Dig it out, boy.

1222
00:39:12,250 --> 00:39:13,585
It's areas like this that we

1223
00:39:13,585 --> 00:39:14,952
Would dig, just to see, because

1224
00:39:14,952 --> 00:39:16,286
That looks a little suspicious.

1225
00:39:16,286 --> 00:39:18,223
You never know.

1226
00:39:25,630 --> 00:39:26,898
So, this corrections officer

1227
00:39:26,898 --> 00:39:28,065
Keeps saying on the bus every

1228
00:39:28,065 --> 00:39:29,199
Morning that rand says he's

1229
00:39:29,199 --> 00:39:31,369
Innocent and he didn't do it.

1230
00:39:31,369 --> 00:39:33,439
And the corrections officer

1231
00:39:33,439 --> 00:39:35,740
Says, "then consider yourself a"

1232
00:39:35,740 --> 00:39:37,576
Martyr for the safety of

1233
00:39:37,576 --> 00:39:38,477
Children.

1234
00:39:38,477 --> 00:39:42,147
"And that's what you are."

1235
00:39:42,147 --> 00:39:43,515
Holly Ann's brother,

1236
00:39:43,515 --> 00:39:45,150
Ed Armstrong, took the stand

1237
00:39:45,150 --> 00:39:45,683
Today.

1238
00:39:45,683 --> 00:39:47,519
He was 14 years old when he last

1239
00:39:47,519 --> 00:39:49,186
Saw his sister on the day she

1240
00:39:49,186 --> 00:39:50,021
Disappeared.

1241
00:39:50,021 --> 00:39:51,490
Since then, he's become a

1242
00:39:51,490 --> 00:39:52,558
Lieutenant in the

1243
00:39:52,558 --> 00:39:54,124
New York police department.

1244
00:39:54,124 --> 00:39:55,860
He's also been instrumental in

1245
00:39:55,860 --> 00:39:58,763
Bringing this case to trial.

1246
00:39:58,763 --> 00:40:00,330
If he has any humanity left

1247
00:40:00,330 --> 00:40:01,799
In his soul, you know, maybe

1248
00:40:01,799 --> 00:40:02,400
He'll see that there was an

1249
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:04,669
Error in his way, and, you

1250
00:40:04,669 --> 00:40:06,271
Know, I could forgive him if he

1251
00:40:06,271 --> 00:40:07,638
Returned the remains of my

1252
00:40:07,638 --> 00:40:08,173
Sister.

1253
00:40:08,173 --> 00:40:09,741
And that's all we ever wanted.

1254
00:40:09,741 --> 00:40:11,276
You know, I didn't care if we

1255
00:40:11,276 --> 00:40:12,778
Ever got a day extra added to

1256
00:40:12,778 --> 00:40:13,578
His sentence.

1257
00:40:13,578 --> 00:40:14,980
All I ever wanted were the

1258
00:40:14,980 --> 00:40:16,113
Remains of my sister.

1259
00:40:16,113 --> 00:40:17,783
If he's got anything left, he'll

1260
00:40:17,783 --> 00:40:24,254
Do that for us.

1261
00:40:24,254 --> 00:40:25,524
Here's holly Ann.

1262
00:40:25,524 --> 00:40:27,292
You were involved in all of

These searches?

1264
00:40:28,325 --> 00:40:32,230
Oh, yeah, yeah.

1265
00:40:32,230 --> 00:40:33,465
How long do you think you

1266
00:40:33,465 --> 00:40:36,366
Searched for her for?

And he changed it to rand.

1274
00:40:49,948 --> 00:40:51,583
This is one where Jennifer was

1275
00:40:51,583 --> 00:40:52,182
Missing.

1276
00:40:52,182 --> 00:40:53,684
Do you think there's any

1277
00:40:53,684 --> 00:40:55,385
Credence in the idea that maybe

1278
00:40:55,385 --> 00:40:56,921
Jennifer was reburied at the

1279

Campsite?

1280
00:40:57,556 --> 00:40:59,224
They found her with the head

1281
00:40:59,224 --> 00:41:00,825
Down, I think it was, and the

00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:03,494
Was repositioned.

1284
00:41:03,494 --> 00:41:05,664
So who do you think maybe...

1285
00:41:05,664 --> 00:41:06,897
That's why we thought there

1286
00:41:06,897 --> 00:41:08,033
Might have been other people

1287
00:41:08,033 --> 00:41:10,836
Involved.

1288
00:41:10,836 --> 00:41:12,437
The rumors surrounding the

1289
00:41:12,437 --> 00:41:13,638
Missing children were

1290
00:41:13,638 --> 00:41:14,505
Overwhelming.

1291
00:41:14,505 --> 00:41:16,140
Some believed that rand didn't

1292
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:17,876
Act alone, that he had help from

1293
00:41:17,876 --> 00:41:19,578
One of the homeless or a former

1294
00:41:19,578 --> 00:41:20,979
Patient from willowbrook.

1295
00:41:20,979 --> 00:41:22,714
Others thought he was framed and

1296
00:41:22,714 --> 00:41:24,349
That the real killer was still

1297
00:41:24,349 --> 00:41:27,285
Out there.

1298
00:41:27,285 --> 00:41:28,886
The only person who knew the

1299
00:41:28,886 --> 00:41:30,254
Truth was rand himself.

1300
00:41:30,254 --> 00:41:32,090
For weeks we had been exchanging

1301
00:41:32,090 --> 00:41:33,792

Information.

1305

He felt all the unwanted

00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:44,334

00:42:14,198 --> 00:42:15,433
All people who knew rand.

1331
00:42:15,433 --> 00:42:16,634
How did they know rand?

1332
00:42:16,634 --> 00:42:18,003
Through Donna's notes, they

1333
00:42:18,003 --> 00:42:19,369
Said, "oh, you know, friend of"

1334
00:42:19,369 --> 00:42:19,771
Rand.

1335
00:42:19,771 --> 00:42:21,872
"Knew rand."

1336
00:42:21,872 --> 00:42:23,074
You don't recognize any of

1337
00:42:23,074 --> 00:42:23,741
These names?

1338
00:42:23,741 --> 00:42:25,210
And Willy has passed away there.

1339
00:42:25,210 --> 00:42:25,876
Oh, okay.

1340
00:42:25,876 --> 00:42:26,344
Okay.

1341
00:42:26,376 --> 00:42:28,279
Does a guy Thomas live here?

1342
00:42:28,279 --> 00:42:30,981
I was around 6, 7 years old,

1343
00:42:30,981 --> 00:42:33,619
And we was all outside playing

1344
00:42:33,652 --> 00:42:35,452
At the ymca.

1345
00:42:35,452 --> 00:42:36,887
The guy was like, "y'all want to"

1346
00:42:36,887 --> 00:42:37,623
Go on a trip?"

1347
00:42:37,623 --> 00:42:38,923
This is the place right here,

1348
00:42:38,923 --> 00:42:39,324
Ymca.

1349
00:42:39,324 --> 00:42:40,457
He had a bus right here.

1350
00:42:40,457 --> 00:42:41,693
It was parked right here at

1351
00:42:41,693 --> 00:42:42,227
The time.

1352
00:42:42,227 --> 00:42:43,228
I'll never forget it.

1353
00:42:43,228 --> 00:42:44,394
We all hopped on the bus.

1354
00:42:44,394 --> 00:42:45,563
We didn't know no better.

1355
00:42:45,563 --> 00:42:46,931
We were little kids, you know?

1356
00:42:46,931 --> 00:42:47,431
Yeah.

1357
00:42:47,431 --> 00:42:48,700
He said he was just gonna

1358
00:42:48,700 --> 00:42:49,668
Take us to the park.

1359
00:42:49,668 --> 00:42:51,637
We wound up in Newark airport.

1360
00:42:51,637 --> 00:42:53,605
So then after that, he took us

1361
00:42:53,605 --> 00:42:55,573
Somewhere in some park, which

1362
00:42:55,573 --> 00:42:56,907
It was pitch-black.

1363
00:42:56,907 --> 00:42:58,508
I think it was willowbrook park

1364
00:42:58,508 --> 00:42:59,277
At the time.

1365
00:42:59,277 --> 00:43:00,044
Pitch-black.

1366
00:43:00,044 --> 00:43:01,478
We were all running around,

1367
00:43:01,478 --> 00:43:02,580
Playing hide and seek and

1368
00:43:02,580 --> 00:43:05,050
Come to find out we were being

1369
00:43:05,050 --> 00:43:06,584
Kidnapped, and we didn't even

1370
00:43:06,584 --> 00:43:08,185
Have a clue what was going on.

1371
00:43:08,185 --> 00:43:09,788
I think he attempted something

1372
00:43:09,788 --> 00:43:11,456
That he couldn't accomplish, and

1373
00:43:11,456 --> 00:43:13,158
I think it, like, dawned on him,

1374
00:43:13,158 --> 00:43:14,792
Like, "I can't do it like this."

1375
00:43:14,792 --> 00:43:16,360
Let me, like, take my steps."

1376
00:43:16,360 --> 00:43:17,996
And I think that's what he did.

1377
00:43:17,996 --> 00:43:19,597
He was like, you know, "let me"

1378
00:43:19,597 --> 00:43:20,598
Work on my prey."

1379
00:43:20,598 --> 00:43:23,067
And that's what he did.

1380
00:43:23,067 --> 00:43:24,501
While some residents were

1381
00:43:24,501 --> 00:43:25,870
Convinced of rand's guilt,

1382
00:43:25,870 --> 00:43:27,105
Others weren't so sure.

1383
00:43:27,105 --> 00:43:27,773
Excuse me.

1384
00:43:27,773 --> 00:43:29,407
Do you guys know a Thomas micol?

1385
00:43:29,407 --> 00:43:30,175
That's me.

1386
00:43:30,175 --> 00:43:30,909
Oh, hey.

1387
00:43:30,909 --> 00:43:32,343
I worked with Andre rand.

1388
00:43:32,343 --> 00:43:33,744
Can we talk to you for a

1389
00:43:33,744 --> 00:43:34,646
Couple minutes?

1390
00:43:34,646 --> 00:43:35,213
Sure.

1391
00:43:35,213 --> 00:43:36,648
They say that he was totally

1392
00:43:36,648 --> 00:43:38,015
Framed for that, that they

1393
00:43:38,015 --> 00:43:40,918
Combed that area...

1394
00:43:40,918 --> 00:43:42,920
Like with a fine-tooth comb.

1395
00:43:42,920 --> 00:43:44,955
After they arrested Andre rand,

1396
00:43:44,955 --> 00:43:46,892
They combed it again, and now

1397
00:43:46,892 --> 00:43:48,894
Her body is there, very easily

1398
00:43:48,894 --> 00:43:49,860
To be found.

1399
00:43:49,860 --> 00:43:51,095
So you know what?

1400
00:43:51,095 --> 00:43:52,930
I would think that maybe he

1401
00:43:52,930 --> 00:43:54,364
Didn't do it either.

1402
00:43:54,364 --> 00:43:56,234
Somebody who did do it moved

1403
00:43:56,234 --> 00:43:58,136
The body there to frame him.

1404
00:43:58,136 --> 00:43:59,905
I thought they were just

1405
00:43:59,905 --> 00:44:01,773
Trying to pin it on somebody,

1406
00:44:01,773 --> 00:44:03,708
And they were gonna blame him,

1407
00:44:03,708 --> 00:44:05,676
Because he was this loner, and,

1408
00:44:05,676 --> 00:44:07,713
You know, he kind of looked, you

1409
00:44:07,713 --> 00:44:09,981
Know, a little scary.

1410
00:44:09,981 --> 00:44:11,581
Searching through old files,

1411
00:44:11,581 --> 00:44:12,984
We came across the name of

1412
00:44:12,984 --> 00:44:13,684
Bob Graham.

1413
00:44:13,684 --> 00:44:15,153
The notes had indicated that

1414
00:44:15,153 --> 00:44:16,787
He knew rand and at one time had

1415
00:44:16,787 --> 00:44:18,088
Been an early suspect in

1416
00:44:18,088 --> 00:44:19,423
Jennifer's disappearance.

1417
00:44:19,423 --> 00:44:20,759
He briefly worked at a

1418
00:44:20,759 --> 00:44:22,426
Hamburger joint on forest Avenue

1419
00:44:22,426 --> 00:44:23,928
Called westley's, and when we

1420
00:44:23,928 --> 00:44:25,196
Used to street-race and

1421
00:44:25,196 --> 00:44:26,832
Drag-race back in the late '60s,

1422
00:44:26,832 --> 00:44:28,266
Early '70s, we used to hide

1423
00:44:28,266 --> 00:44:28,767
There.

1424
00:44:28,767 --> 00:44:30,335
He had the paper hat on, and he

1425
00:44:30,335 --> 00:44:31,970
Was sweeping up the parking lot,

1426
00:44:31,970 --> 00:44:33,471
Or he was behind the counter,

1427
00:44:33,471 --> 00:44:35,072
You know, putting cheese on the

1428
00:44:35,072 --> 00:44:35,941
Burgers.

1429
00:44:35,941 --> 00:44:38,408
And he had this volkswagen that

1430
00:44:38,408 --> 00:44:40,510
I noticed was in the weeds

1431
00:44:40,510 --> 00:44:42,146
Behind willowbrook.

1432
00:44:42,146 --> 00:44:43,314
He was living in the car;

1433
00:44:43,314 --> 00:44:44,750
There was a pathway down there.

1434
00:44:44,750 --> 00:44:46,050
And I heard things about the

1435
00:44:46,050 --> 00:44:48,485
Tunnel network under willowbrook

1436
00:44:48,485 --> 00:44:49,254
State school.

1437
00:44:49,254 --> 00:44:50,722
It was set up like a hub with

1438
00:44:50,722 --> 00:44:51,222
Spokes.

1439
00:44:51,222 --> 00:44:52,622
You could get, say, from the

1440
00:44:52,622 --> 00:44:54,024
Cafeteria out to every ward.

1441
00:44:54,024 --> 00:44:55,393
He could survive down there

1442
00:44:55,393 --> 00:44:56,895
Because he had worked there at

1443
00:44:56,895 --> 00:44:57,395
One time.

1444
00:44:57,395 --> 00:44:58,662
So, were there other people

1445
00:44:58,662 --> 00:44:59,563
Living in the woods?

1446
00:44:59,563 --> 00:45:00,766
There's a lot of them out

1447
00:45:00,766 --> 00:45:01,631
Here, not just him.

1448
00:45:01,631 --> 00:45:02,700
There are a lot of them out

1449
00:45:02,700 --> 00:45:07,272
There's something up there.

1450
00:45:07,272 --> 00:45:08,606
Look, maybe this is what

1451
00:45:08,606 --> 00:45:09,673
He's talking about.

1452
00:45:09,673 --> 00:45:11,141
There's a tunnel.

1453
00:45:11,141 --> 00:45:13,211
Goes all the way down here.

1454
00:45:13,243 --> 00:45:15,312
There's a city under a city.

1455
00:45:15,312 --> 00:45:16,881
Between the rats running around

1456
00:45:16,881 --> 00:45:18,315
And the sewer water that had

1457
00:45:18,315 --> 00:45:20,285
Seeped in and...

1458
00:45:20,285 --> 00:45:21,685
The dirty clothes and...

1459
00:45:21,719 --> 00:45:25,090
Racks of clothes, cots.

1460
00:45:25,090 --> 00:45:26,792
It's an old wheelchair.

1461
00:45:26,792 --> 00:45:28,625
Wow. That's pretty crazy.

1462
00:45:28,625 --> 00:45:30,728
Obviously, men, women, and

1463
00:45:30,728 --> 00:45:32,964
Children were living down there,

1464
00:45:32,964 --> 00:45:34,564
Including Andre rand.

1465
00:45:34,564 --> 00:45:36,700
Yeah, he had his own little

1466
00:45:36,700 --> 00:45:37,968
Circle of friends there.

1467
00:45:37,968 --> 00:45:39,437
Look. All these have these

1468
00:45:39,437 --> 00:45:40,872
Holes in it, and they're all

1469
00:45:40,872 --> 00:45:42,440
Really clean for people to live

1470
00:45:42,440 --> 00:45:42,774
In.

1471
00:45:42,774 --> 00:45:43,809
Look at that floor.

1472
00:45:43,809 --> 00:45:45,209
That floor has been totally

1473
00:45:45,209 --> 00:45:46,610
Wiped clean.

1474
00:45:46,610 --> 00:45:48,478
Andre rand had this sort of

1475
00:45:48,478 --> 00:45:52,350
Really low-class, white-trash

1476
00:45:52,350 --> 00:45:54,820
Version of Jim Jones going.

1477
00:45:54,820 --> 00:45:58,088
Somehow, he managed to get

1478
00:45:58,088 --> 00:45:59,056
People to follow him.

1479
00:45:59,056 --> 00:46:00,190
Who were they, though?

1480
00:46:00,190 --> 00:46:01,359
Well, he had some other

1481
00:46:01,359 --> 00:46:04,661
Homeless.

1482
00:46:04,661 --> 00:46:07,197
Somebody's been staying here.

1483
00:46:07,197 --> 00:46:09,499
Cream of mushroom soup, old

1484
00:46:09,499 --> 00:46:10,335
Dishes.

1485
00:46:10,335 --> 00:46:12,702
Flowers.

1486
00:46:12,702 --> 00:46:14,972
I remember one day, we found

1487
00:46:14,972 --> 00:46:17,275
A mattress with men's razors and

1488
00:46:17,275 --> 00:46:19,510
A toothbrush and men's clothing

1489
00:46:19,510 --> 00:46:21,711
With one pair of little girl's

1490
00:46:21,711 --> 00:46:22,980
Panties.

1491
00:46:22,980 --> 00:46:25,583
I think that he was passing

1492
00:46:25,583 --> 00:46:27,886
The children around to his

1493
00:46:27,886 --> 00:46:30,487
Friends, who were just as sick

1494
00:46:30,487 --> 00:46:31,890
As him.

1495
00:46:31,890 --> 00:46:33,557
So, do you think rand was the

1496
00:46:33,557 --> 00:46:34,724
Only one responsible?

1497
00:46:34,724 --> 00:46:37,161
In Jennifer's killing?

1498
00:46:37,161 --> 00:46:38,628
No, I don't think he could

1499
00:46:38,628 --> 00:46:40,065
Have done it all by himself.

1500
00:46:40,065 --> 00:46:41,631
They told us a lot of strange

1501
00:46:41,631 --> 00:46:42,199
Stories.

1502
00:46:42,199 --> 00:46:43,600
They told us strange things

1503
00:46:43,600 --> 00:46:45,169
About Andre we could never prove

1504
00:46:45,169 --> 00:46:45,904
Or disprove.

1505
00:46:45,904 --> 00:46:47,305
You're talking about having

1506
00:46:47,305 --> 00:46:48,406
Sex with dead people.

1507
00:46:48,406 --> 00:46:49,841
There's a story, whether you

1508
00:46:49,841 --> 00:46:51,241
Heard that one or not.

1509
00:46:51,241 --> 00:46:53,110
The thing that Andre used to

1510
00:46:53,110 --> 00:46:55,013
Do is used to dig up dead bodies

1511
00:46:55,013 --> 00:46:58,048
In the cemetery and had sex with

1512
00:46:58,048 --> 00:47:00,284
These bodies.

1513
00:47:00,284 --> 00:47:01,887
Did you find it strange that

1514
00:47:01,887 --> 00:47:02,820
There was kind of this

1515
00:47:02,820 --> 00:47:04,555
Underbelly to staten island?

1516
00:47:04,555 --> 00:47:06,123
I would've never guessed the

1517
00:47:06,123 --> 00:47:07,557
Amount of weirdos living on

1518
00:47:07,557 --> 00:47:09,094
Staten island that I ran into.

1519
00:47:09,094 --> 00:47:10,661
You know, why aren't people

1520
00:47:10,661 --> 00:47:14,932
Aware of what's going on here?

1521
00:47:14,932 --> 00:47:16,801
To those who even remotely

1522
00:47:16,801 --> 00:47:18,435
Knew Andre rand, he was a

1523
00:47:18,435 --> 00:47:19,637
Complete mystery.

1524
00:47:19,637 --> 00:47:21,671
The more we tried to learn about

1525
00:47:21,671 --> 00:47:23,307
Him, the more bizarre the

1526
00:47:23,307 --> 00:47:25,775
Stories became.

1527
00:47:25,775 --> 00:47:27,177
It was becoming harder for us

1528
00:47:27,177 --> 00:47:29,246
To tell the difference between

1529
00:47:29,246 --> 00:47:31,281
The facts...

1530
00:47:31,281 --> 00:47:33,218
And the folklore.

1531
00:47:49,935 --> 00:47:52,003
In an almost replay of rand's

1532
00:47:52,003 --> 00:47:54,005
First trial, the prosecution is

1533
00:47:54,005 --> 00:47:56,074
Once again relying on eyewitness

1534
00:47:56,074 --> 00:48:00,946
Testimony to prove its case.

1535
00:48:00,946 --> 00:48:02,880
Some of those who testified were

1536
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:04,781
Former alcoholics or drug

1537
00:48:04,781 --> 00:48:06,683
Addicts who now say they can

1538
00:48:06,683 --> 00:48:08,786
Recall the details of that night

1539
00:48:08,786 --> 00:48:15,626
Over 20 years ago.

1540
00:48:15,626 --> 00:48:17,362
Burns changed his story back

1541
00:48:17,362 --> 00:48:18,964
And forth, but basically he's

1542
00:48:18,964 --> 00:48:19,630
Drinking.

1543
00:48:19,630 --> 00:48:20,730
He sees holly Ann.

1544
00:48:20,730 --> 00:48:22,400
He sees rand talking to holly.

1545
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:24,034
He was the first witness that

1546
00:48:24,034 --> 00:48:26,736
Put rand next to holly Ann.

1547
00:48:26,736 --> 00:48:28,238
So in that 17 years, he never

1548
00:48:28,238 --> 00:48:28,940
Came forward?

1549
00:48:28,940 --> 00:48:30,040
Never came forward.

1550
00:48:30,040 --> 00:48:31,375
That was the key part of our

1551
00:48:31,375 --> 00:48:31,808
Cross.

1552
00:48:31,808 --> 00:48:32,542
That was key.

1553
00:48:32,542 --> 00:48:34,544
Never came forward.

1554
00:48:34,544 --> 00:48:35,981
Other witnesses could provide

1555
00:48:35,981 --> 00:48:37,347
Only the vaguest of details in

1556
00:48:37,347 --> 00:48:38,183
Their testimony.

1557
00:48:38,183 --> 00:48:39,917
What was he like?

1558
00:48:39,917 --> 00:48:41,818
Oh, you don't want to meet

1559
00:48:41,818 --> 00:48:42,319
Him.

1560
00:48:42,319 --> 00:48:43,454
He was a creep.

1561
00:48:43,454 --> 00:48:44,122
Why?

1562
00:48:44,122 --> 00:48:46,156
'Cause he looked like he was

1563
00:48:46,156 --> 00:48:48,960
A killer.

1564
00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:50,227
I just said what I had to say,

1565
00:48:50,227 --> 00:48:50,894
And that's it.

1566
00:48:50,894 --> 00:48:52,030
Did you see anything the

1567
00:48:52,030 --> 00:48:52,930
Night that holly Ann

1568
00:48:52,930 --> 00:48:53,531
Disappeared?

1569
00:48:53,531 --> 00:48:54,864
Yeah, I heard a scream, and I

1570
00:48:54,864 --> 00:48:57,002
Heard her say, "let me go."

1571
00:48:57,002 --> 00:48:59,336
We had people that that held

1572
00:48:59,336 --> 00:49:01,371
Back information that we're

1573
00:49:01,371 --> 00:49:02,940
Finding out today that were drug

1574
00:49:02,940 --> 00:49:05,709
Addicts, dope dealers.

1575
00:49:05,709 --> 00:49:07,044
What did you need that you

1576
00:49:07,044 --> 00:49:07,712
Didn't have?

1577
00:49:07,712 --> 00:49:09,080
We needed to put her in the

1578
00:49:09,080 --> 00:49:09,413
Car.

1579
00:49:09,413 --> 00:49:10,581
To put her in the car?

1580
00:49:10,581 --> 00:49:11,115
Right.

1581
00:49:11,115 --> 00:49:12,250
And you had no actual

1582
00:49:12,250 --> 00:49:13,717
Witnesses to put her in the car?

1583
00:49:13,717 --> 00:49:14,685
Not at that time.

1584
00:49:14,685 --> 00:49:16,053
He pulled up in his little,

1585
00:49:16,053 --> 00:49:17,487
Green car, asked us if we wanted

1586
00:49:17,487 --> 00:49:18,555
Candy.

1587
00:49:18,555 --> 00:49:19,557
She went to go get it.

1588
00:49:19,557 --> 00:49:20,890
She put her arm in the car as he

1589
00:49:20,890 --> 00:49:22,193
Opened up the door, and that's

1590
00:49:22,193 --> 00:49:24,262
The last I've ever seen of her.

1591
00:49:24,262 --> 00:49:25,763
In a surprising turn of

1592
00:49:25,763 --> 00:49:27,532
Events, Tanya goodson was called

1593
00:49:27,532 --> 00:49:28,398
To the stand.

1594
00:49:28,398 --> 00:49:30,035
A playmate of holly Ann's who

1595
00:49:30,035 --> 00:49:31,401
Was 6 at the time, Tanya

1596
00:49:31,401 --> 00:49:33,004
Testified that she saw rand,

1597
00:49:33,004 --> 00:49:34,505
Wearing a mask and holding

1598
00:49:34,505 --> 00:49:36,174
Candy, pull holly Ann into his

1599
00:49:36,174 --> 00:49:36,574
Car.

1600
00:49:36,574 --> 00:49:38,176
So, when you said when he took

1601
00:49:38,176 --> 00:49:39,843
Holly Ann he was wearing a mask.

1602
00:49:39,843 --> 00:49:40,944
Tell me about that.

1603
00:49:40,944 --> 00:49:42,480
The mask I don't remember.

1604
00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:43,913
All I know is his face was

1605
00:49:43,913 --> 00:49:44,482
Covered.

1606
00:49:44,482 --> 00:49:45,815
I couldn't see his face.

1607
00:49:45,815 --> 00:49:47,417
So it might not have been a

1608
00:49:47,417 --> 00:49:48,952
Mask, just like maybe his hat

1609
00:49:48,952 --> 00:49:49,953
Pulled down or...

1610
00:49:49,953 --> 00:49:51,321
No, his whole face was

1611
00:49:51,321 --> 00:49:51,888
Covered.

1612
00:49:51,888 --> 00:49:53,390
But when he said, "do you"

1613
00:49:53,390 --> 00:49:54,958
"Want candy?" Did he look that

1614
00:49:54,958 --> 00:49:56,360
Bizarre, with the mask and

1615
00:49:56,360 --> 00:49:56,860
Stuff?

1616
00:49:56,860 --> 00:49:58,129
He looked scary.

1617
00:49:58,129 --> 00:49:59,929
So, you knew Jennifer, and

1618
00:49:59,929 --> 00:50:01,199
You knew holly Ann?

1619
00:50:01,199 --> 00:50:03,000
Yeah. I knew a bunch of them

1620
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:04,534
That he had kidnapped.

1621
00:50:04,534 --> 00:50:06,371
Did you know Hank gafforio?

1622
00:50:06,371 --> 00:50:08,005
That one I didn't know.

1623
00:50:08,005 --> 00:50:09,840
I knew latisha.

1624
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:10,408
Tiahease?

1625
00:50:10,408 --> 00:50:11,242
Tiahease Jackson?

1626
00:50:11,242 --> 00:50:11,675
Yeah.

1627
00:50:11,675 --> 00:50:12,776
All these people you knew

1628
00:50:12,776 --> 00:50:14,011
Growing up on staten island, and

1629
00:50:14,011 --> 00:50:15,080
They all were disappearing.

1630
00:50:15,080 --> 00:50:17,482
What did you think?

1631
00:50:17,482 --> 00:50:19,117
I didn't think anything

1632
00:50:19,117 --> 00:50:20,650
Because I was too young.

1633
00:50:20,650 --> 00:50:22,553
And now that I am older, I came

1634
00:50:22,553 --> 00:50:24,522
Here to do what I got to do, and

1635
00:50:24,522 --> 00:50:27,157
I feel a whole lot better now.

1636
00:50:32,563 --> 00:50:33,663
Mr. rand, what do you have to

1637
00:50:33,663 --> 00:50:34,532
Say to the staten island

1638
00:50:34,532 --> 00:50:35,800
Community?

1639
00:50:41,338 --> 00:50:44,274
[ Camera shutters clicking ]

1640
00:51:05,495 --> 00:51:07,664
And that's 675 tysens Lane.

1641
00:51:07,664 --> 00:51:09,166
This is it, yeah.

1642
00:51:09,166 --> 00:51:11,101
30 years ago.

1643
00:51:20,311 --> 00:51:22,279
Alice lived here with...

1644
00:51:22,279 --> 00:51:24,682
Her mother, who had multiple

1645
00:51:24,682 --> 00:51:26,951
Sclerosis, was about 26 years

1646
00:51:26,983 --> 00:51:29,086
Old at the time.

1647
00:51:29,086 --> 00:51:30,354
And, of course, there's

1648
00:51:30,354 --> 00:51:31,921
Andre rand, would stand right

1649
00:51:31,921 --> 00:51:33,591
There all the time, right where

1650
00:51:33,591 --> 00:51:34,392
That door is.

1651
00:51:34,392 --> 00:51:35,925
And he was a maintenance man

1652
00:51:35,925 --> 00:51:36,361
Here.

1653
00:51:36,361 --> 00:51:37,961
And where was the father at

1654
00:51:37,961 --> 00:51:38,629
The time?

1655
00:51:38,629 --> 00:51:39,896
They were separated.

1656
00:51:39,896 --> 00:51:41,465
They were separated for about

1657
00:51:41,465 --> 00:51:43,100
Three years, and that's why the

1658
00:51:43,100 --> 00:51:44,568
Detectives thought that the

1659
00:51:44,568 --> 00:51:46,035
Father might have taken the

1660
00:51:46,035 --> 00:51:46,536
Child.

1661
00:51:46,536 --> 00:51:48,071
And so they did not focus on

1662
00:51:48,071 --> 00:51:49,573
The child being kidnapped by

1663
00:51:49,573 --> 00:51:51,508
Some deviate.

1664
00:52:00,584 --> 00:52:02,519
We just want closure, all of us.

1665
00:52:02,519 --> 00:52:03,120
That's all.

1666
00:52:03,120 --> 00:52:06,324
Of course.

1667
00:52:06,324 --> 00:52:08,993
It's been so many years.

1668
00:52:08,993 --> 00:52:16,900
It's like everybody forgot.

1669
00:52:16,900 --> 00:52:18,568
He sent a picture of his

Cannot answer many of your

Questions at this time.

1674
00:52:24,642 --> 00:52:26,511
The documentary film you put so

1675
00:52:26,511 --> 00:52:28,446
Much faith into will never stand

1676
00:52:28,446 --> 00:52:30,248
Up to the exculpatory evidence

1677
00:52:30,248 --> 00:52:31,080
In my book.

1678
00:52:31,080 --> 00:52:32,950
You might mean well, but later,

1679
00:52:32,950 --> 00:52:34,752
Other moviemakers will pick up

1680
00:52:34,752 --> 00:52:36,019
Where you left off.

1681
00:52:36,019 --> 00:52:37,922
As long as I'm in prison, I will

1682
00:52:37,922 --> 00:52:39,757
Give the moviemakers reason to

1683
00:52:39,757 --> 00:52:41,525
Portray me as an evil person.

1684
00:52:41,525 --> 00:52:43,026
You see, evilness sells.

1685
00:52:43,026 --> 00:52:44,929
"That's the name of their game."

1686
00:52:44,929 --> 00:52:46,163
Rand was right.

1687
00:52:46,163 --> 00:52:47,964
The evil, not hard facts, was

1688
00:52:47,964 --> 00:52:49,267
Pushing this trial.

1689
00:52:49,267 --> 00:52:50,835
But then the coincidences

1690
00:52:50,835 --> 00:52:52,169
Couldn't be ignored.

1691
00:52:52,169 --> 00:52:53,738
We knew we had to get an

1692
00:52:53,738 --> 00:52:55,706
Interview, but now, in exchange,

1693
00:52:55,706 --> 00:52:57,342
Rand was pushing for us to

1694
00:52:57,342 --> 00:52:59,609
Proclaim his innocence.

1695
00:52:59,609 --> 00:53:01,478
"Barbara, type me an exact list"

1696
00:53:01,478 --> 00:53:03,180
Of the questions or discussions

1697
00:53:03,180 --> 00:53:05,149
You're going to ask me during

1698
00:53:05,149 --> 00:53:09,486
"Your documentary."

1699
00:53:09,486 --> 00:53:10,920
This is, I think, the route

1700
00:53:10,920 --> 00:53:14,324
That he took holly Ann on.

1701
00:53:14,324 --> 00:53:16,460
All the clues led us right along

1702
00:53:16,460 --> 00:53:17,827
Here, right up into

1703
00:53:17,827 --> 00:53:19,230
Baron hirsch.

1704
00:53:19,230 --> 00:53:21,531
So he had a campsite in here?

1705
00:53:21,531 --> 00:53:24,901
We think it was his.

1706
00:53:24,901 --> 00:53:26,304
She could be in one of these

1707
00:53:26,304 --> 00:53:27,238
Graves over here.

1708
00:53:27,238 --> 00:53:28,672
If he had a bar or something,

1709
00:53:28,672 --> 00:53:30,207
He could've moved a lid over,

1710
00:53:30,207 --> 00:53:31,641
Put the body in there with an

1711
00:53:31,641 --> 00:53:32,943
Older body, and covered it

1712
00:53:32,943 --> 00:53:34,512
Back up again, and nobody'd ever

1713
00:53:34,512 --> 00:53:35,111
Find her.

1714
00:53:35,111 --> 00:53:36,680
'Cause a lot of these are loose.

1715
00:53:36,680 --> 00:53:37,180
Right.

1716
00:53:37,180 --> 00:53:38,416
There's a body down below

1717
00:53:38,416 --> 00:53:38,816
There.

1718
00:53:38,816 --> 00:53:40,116
I don't know how deep they bury

1719
00:53:40,116 --> 00:53:42,051
Them.

1720
00:53:42,051 --> 00:53:43,788
These are all children.

1721
00:53:43,788 --> 00:53:45,723
At first, we were thinking

1722
00:53:45,723 --> 00:53:47,691
Maybe he sold them to use for

1723
00:53:47,691 --> 00:53:49,760
Cult activities or whatever, you

1724
00:53:49,760 --> 00:53:50,328
Know?

1725
00:53:50,328 --> 00:53:51,160
Really?

1726
00:53:51,160 --> 00:53:52,863
You think it's definitely

1727
00:53:52,863 --> 00:53:53,764
Legitimate?

1728
00:53:53,764 --> 00:53:55,164
I wouldn't doubt it.

1729
00:53:55,164 --> 00:53:57,001
I mean, what made you believe

1730
00:53:57,001 --> 00:53:58,403
That that was going on?

1731
00:53:58,403 --> 00:54:00,169
Well, we had the son of Sam

1732
00:54:00,169 --> 00:54:01,406
Out there, you know?

1733
00:54:01,406 --> 00:54:03,106
That goes into cults in a big

1734
00:54:03,106 --> 00:54:03,240
Way.

1735
00:54:03,240 --> 00:54:04,909
I guess, only because that's

1736
00:54:04,909 --> 00:54:06,410
Something that people thought of

1737
00:54:06,410 --> 00:54:07,578
Back then, 20 years ago.

1738
00:54:07,578 --> 00:54:08,446
Maybe not today.

1739
00:54:08,446 --> 00:54:09,880
They're still thinking about

1740
00:54:09,880 --> 00:54:11,816
It.

1741
00:54:20,991 --> 00:54:23,361
Andre was into the devil's

1742
00:54:23,361 --> 00:54:25,363
Cult, and being a native

1743
00:54:25,363 --> 00:54:27,432
Staten islander, I really

1744
00:54:27,432 --> 00:54:32,002
Couldn't believe how much...

1745
00:54:32,035 --> 00:54:34,170
How big it is on staten island.

1746
00:54:34,170 --> 00:54:35,973
We went to one establishment

1747
00:54:35,973 --> 00:54:37,842
Where the basement was set up

1748
00:54:37,842 --> 00:54:39,609
Like... I guess what they'd

1749
00:54:39,609 --> 00:54:41,546
Call the church, and they used

1750
00:54:41,546 --> 00:54:43,314
To hold their ceremonies on

1751
00:54:43,314 --> 00:54:44,449
Actually the old

1752
00:54:44,449 --> 00:54:46,050
Willowbrook state school

1753
00:54:46,050 --> 00:54:46,750
Grounds.

1754
00:54:46,750 --> 00:54:48,518
So you don't think it was

1755
00:54:48,518 --> 00:54:49,053
Kids?

1756
00:54:49,053 --> 00:54:50,488
Oh, definitely not.

1757
00:54:50,488 --> 00:54:51,556
Definitely not.

1758
00:54:51,556 --> 00:54:53,558
I think it was adults that would

1759
00:54:53,558 --> 00:54:54,992
Hold these ceremonies.

1760
00:54:54,992 --> 00:54:56,861
And I think Andre rand and his

1761
00:54:56,861 --> 00:54:58,261
Crew were part of it.

1762
00:54:58,261 --> 00:55:00,129
Whether initiated or not, they

1763
00:55:00,129 --> 00:55:01,264
Were part of it.

1764
00:55:01,264 --> 00:55:03,166
It's hard for us to believe,

1765
00:55:03,166 --> 00:55:04,834
But if you had to convince

1766
00:55:04,834 --> 00:55:06,771
Somebody that it was real, what

1767
00:55:06,771 --> 00:55:09,006
Would you say?

1768
00:55:09,006 --> 00:55:11,809
I would say is get a couple

1769
00:55:11,809 --> 00:55:14,545
Of his friends, sit down, and

1770
00:55:14,545 --> 00:55:16,012
Talk to them.

1771
00:55:16,012 --> 00:55:18,982
And by them just talking, you'll

1772
00:55:18,982 --> 00:55:20,317
Realize how bad it was.

1773
00:55:20,317 --> 00:55:21,919
One time, I was invited to

1774
00:55:21,919 --> 00:55:23,621
The precinct to talk to them as

1775
00:55:23,621 --> 00:55:25,356
They recorded me, and they start

1776
00:55:25,356 --> 00:55:26,624
Telling me about devil

1777
00:55:26,624 --> 00:55:28,224
Worshipping on staten island,

1778
00:55:28,224 --> 00:55:29,994
That maybe he was a part of this

1779
00:55:29,994 --> 00:55:30,460
Cult.

1780
00:55:30,460 --> 00:55:31,761
And I didn't believe it.

1781
00:55:31,761 --> 00:55:33,398
What did they think was going

1782
00:55:33,398 --> 00:55:33,763
On?

1783
00:55:33,763 --> 00:55:35,199
That maybe some of these

1784
00:55:35,199 --> 00:55:36,800
Devil worshippers had something

1785
00:55:36,800 --> 00:55:38,369
To do with the kids vanishing.

1786
00:55:38,369 --> 00:55:39,736
You can paint parallels to

1787
00:55:39,736 --> 00:55:41,270
Anything and say, "oh, yeah."

1788
00:55:41,270 --> 00:55:44,240
You know, I can take a picture

1789
00:55:44,240 --> 00:55:45,910
Of anybody.

1790
00:55:45,910 --> 00:55:46,710
Okay?

1791
00:55:46,710 --> 00:55:49,447
And I can say, "this man is a"

1792
00:55:49,447 --> 00:55:52,682
Mass murderer."

1793
00:55:52,682 --> 00:55:54,751
And they say, "yeah, I can tell!"

1794
00:55:54,751 --> 00:55:55,685
I can tell."

1795
00:55:55,685 --> 00:55:58,055
I could say, "this man rescued"

1796
00:55:58,055 --> 00:56:00,089
Six people from a burning

1797
00:56:00,089 --> 00:56:01,125
"Building."

1798
00:56:01,125 --> 00:56:03,360
"I can tell he's a good man."

1799
00:56:20,777 --> 00:56:22,246
In addition to the police

1800
00:56:22,246 --> 00:56:24,080
Investigation, other evidence of

1801
00:56:24,080 --> 00:56:25,782
Cult activity had been mailed

1802
00:56:25,782 --> 00:56:27,051
To Jennifer's family.

1803
00:56:27,051 --> 00:56:28,886
A mysterious letter claimed that

1804
00:56:28,886 --> 00:56:30,720
Rand had been supplying children

1805
00:56:30,720 --> 00:56:32,389
To the church of the process,

1806
00:56:32,389 --> 00:56:33,558
The same cult that

1807
00:56:33,558 --> 00:56:35,291
David berkowitz alleged helped

1808
00:56:35,291 --> 00:56:36,760
Him commit the son of Sam

1809
00:56:36,760 --> 00:56:37,428
Murders.

1810
00:56:37,428 --> 00:56:39,295
This anonymous letter was traced

1811
00:56:39,295 --> 00:56:41,197
Back to Veronica lueken, a local

1812
00:56:41,197 --> 00:56:42,866
Woman with her own religious

1813
00:56:42,866 --> 00:56:45,201
Following.

1814
00:56:45,201 --> 00:56:46,803
So basically this group right

1815
00:56:46,803 --> 00:56:48,337
Down over here, you know, they

1816
00:56:48,337 --> 00:56:49,607
Wrote these letters from

1817
00:56:49,607 --> 00:56:50,941
10/4/87, which is a couple

1818
00:56:50,941 --> 00:56:52,076
Months after Jennifer

1819
00:56:52,076 --> 00:56:52,677
Disappeared.

1820
00:56:52,677 --> 00:56:53,877
"I thought I'd write you this"

1821
00:56:53,877 --> 00:56:55,112
Note to try and enlighten you,

1822
00:56:55,112 --> 00:56:56,279
At the same time reassure you

1823
00:56:56,279 --> 00:56:57,548
About the crimes that are being

1824
00:56:57,548 --> 00:56:58,583
Committed on the island.

1825
00:56:58,583 --> 00:56:59,749
Well, I did a little checking

1826
00:56:59,749 --> 00:57:01,018
On the recent disappearances and

1827
00:57:01,018 --> 00:57:02,218
Murders of these kids, and it

1828
00:57:02,218 --> 00:57:03,352
Looks like some of them were

1829
00:57:03,352 --> 00:57:04,488
Victims of what is called a

1830
00:57:04,488 --> 00:57:05,756
Satanic black mass.

1831
00:57:05,756 --> 00:57:07,257
Andre rand did not kill

1832
00:57:07,257 --> 00:57:08,024
Jennifer.

1833
00:57:08,024 --> 00:57:09,726
All he did was bring her to

1834
00:57:09,726 --> 00:57:10,527
The coven.

1835
00:57:10,527 --> 00:57:12,296
Too bad that they covered it

1836
00:57:12,296 --> 00:57:13,630
Up, but who wants to admit that

1837
00:57:13,630 --> 00:57:14,999
Staten island is literally going

1838
00:57:14,999 --> 00:57:15,500
To hell?

1839
00:57:15,500 --> 00:57:16,600
It is a picnic ground for

1840
00:57:16,600 --> 00:57:16,966
Them.

1841
00:57:16,966 --> 00:57:18,201
There are bodies buried that

1842
00:57:18,201 --> 00:57:20,004
"Will never be found."

1843
00:57:20,004 --> 00:57:21,438
Hail Mary, full of grace, the

1844
00:57:21,438 --> 00:57:22,338
Lord is with thee.

1845
00:57:22,338 --> 00:57:23,773
Blessed are thou amongst women,

1846
00:57:23,773 --> 00:57:25,175
And blessed is the fruit of thy

1847
00:57:25,175 --> 00:57:25,875
"Womb, Jesus."

1848
00:57:25,875 --> 00:57:27,244
So, can we speak to you for

1849
00:57:27,244 --> 00:57:27,877
One minute?

1850
00:57:27,877 --> 00:57:29,013
Can you give me, like, a

1851
00:57:29,013 --> 00:57:30,413
Summation of what she said back

1852
00:57:30,413 --> 00:57:31,516
Then?

1853
00:57:38,187 --> 00:57:39,322
Do you believe it actually goes

1854
00:57:39,322 --> 00:57:40,256
On?

1855
00:57:43,827 --> 00:57:45,162
So, I think it would be great if

1856
00:57:45,162 --> 00:57:46,230
You could speak for your

1857
00:57:46,230 --> 00:57:48,197
Organization.

1858
00:57:48,197 --> 00:57:48,566
Okay.

1859
00:57:48,566 --> 00:57:49,600
'Cause you're worried about

1860
00:57:49,600 --> 00:57:50,535
Them?

1861
00:57:58,374 --> 00:57:59,442
Do you think they're all

1862
00:57:59,442 --> 00:58:01,245
Around us?

1863
00:58:01,245 --> 00:58:02,812
The lord is with thee.

1864
00:58:02,812 --> 00:58:03,480
This is the transcription

1865
00:58:03,480 --> 00:58:05,683
From an interview that

1866
00:58:05,683 --> 00:58:07,184
Detectives in 1988 did with

1867
00:58:07,184 --> 00:58:08,819
Andre rand while he was up in

1868
00:58:08,819 --> 00:58:10,387
Sing sing.

1869
00:58:10,387 --> 00:58:12,557
For the first...

1870
00:58:12,557 --> 00:58:15,424
Half an hour, they discuss devil

1871
00:58:15,424 --> 00:58:16,192
Worshipping.

1872
00:58:16,192 --> 00:58:17,862
"So you were camping out when he"

1873
00:58:17,862 --> 00:58:19,329
Told you that there might be

1874
00:58:19,329 --> 00:58:20,630
Satanic goings-on in the

1875
00:58:20,630 --> 00:58:21,631
Willowbrook area?

1876
00:58:21,631 --> 00:58:23,367
Now it's 1987, and you hear

1877
00:58:23,367 --> 00:58:24,701
About this cult operating around

1878
00:58:24,701 --> 00:58:25,870
The same neighborhood, human

1879
00:58:25,870 --> 00:58:26,469
Sacrifices.

1880
00:58:26,469 --> 00:58:27,605
Didn't you say to yourself,

1881
00:58:27,605 --> 00:58:28,806
'Maybe they're the ones that

1882
00:58:28,806 --> 00:58:29,906
Snatched that little girl?'

1883
00:58:29,906 --> 00:58:31,809
"Did that occur to you?"

1884
00:58:31,809 --> 00:58:33,077
So, when you went up to

1885
00:58:33,077 --> 00:58:34,711
Sing sing in '98, you discussed

1886
00:58:34,711 --> 00:58:36,280

01:05:02,432 --> 01:05:03,900
Interview that we had with him,

2075
01:05:03,900 --> 01:05:06,435
We had written to him.

2076
01:05:06,435 --> 01:05:09,940
We went back up, and he said,

2077
01:05:09,940 --> 01:05:10,540
"Sure, no problem."

2078
01:05:10,540 --> 01:05:11,041

2080

But you'll come to my house.

2081
01:05:14,979 --> 01:05:16,045
You can't move me.

2082
01:05:16,045 --> 01:05:17,647
I won't talk to you unless you

2083
01:05:17,647 --> 01:05:20,584
"Speak to me in my home."

2084
01:05:20,584 --> 01:05:23,087
And we went up there, and

2085
01:05:23,087 --> 01:05:25,789
He told the correction people,

2086
01:05:25,789 --> 01:05:26,656
"I changed my mind.

2088
01:05:32,361 --> 01:05:37,101
He wouldn't talk to us, so...

2089

It's a game for him.

2091

To me, he's a very smart man.

2092
01:05:46,143 --> 01:05:48,578
He knew how to commit the crime

2093
01:05:48,578 --> 01:05:50,214
And not get caught.

2094
01:05:50,214 --> 01:05:53,349
And like he said to me, "why"

2095
01:05:53,349 --> 01:05:55,184
Is it that you guys don't find

2096
01:05:55,184 --> 01:05:58,622

Off on answering rand after his

01:06:14,538 --> 01:06:15,972
Most recent letters.

2107
01:06:15,972 --> 01:06:17,774
They were becoming more and

2108
01:06:17,774 --> 01:06:18,808
More bizarre.

2109
01:06:18,808 --> 01:06:20,676
His handwriting had changed,

2110
01:06:20,676 --> 01:06:22,212
And he was now quoting

2111
01:06:22,212 --> 01:06:22,979
Scripture.

2112
01:06:22,979 --> 01:06:24,648
"No one brings suit justly."

2113
01:06:24,648 --> 01:06:26,182
No one pleads truthfully.

2114
01:06:26,182 --> 01:06:27,851
They trust in emptiness and

2115
01:06:27,851 --> 01:06:28,617
Tell lies.

They conceive mischief and

Bring forth malice.

They hatch adders' eggs and

2119
01:06:33,122 --> 01:06:34,423
Weave spiders' webs.

2120
01:06:34,423 --> 01:06:36,126
Whoever eats their eggs will

Beliefs.

2126
01:06:42,766 --> 01:06:44,967
Children are emotionally wasted,

Why's he keep focusing on women?

2130
01:06:50,373 --> 01:06:52,542
Maybe he saw things as a child?

2131
01:06:52,542 --> 01:06:54,711
I mean, nobody really knows his

Told.

Rand writes in his letters

2151
01:07:25,874 --> 01:07:27,644
That his mother was committed to

Go there to visit.

With a population that once

Happened in his life that you

01:11:48,671 --> 01:11:49,339
You?

2261
01:11:49,339 --> 01:11:51,206
Some people had.

2262
01:11:51,206 --> 01:11:54,042
They didn't view me as a friend.

2263
01:11:54,042 --> 01:12:00,248
But I was a friend of Jennifer.

2264
01:12:00,248 --> 01:12:01,951
Why do you believe he took

2265
01:12:01,951 --> 01:12:02,651
Jennifer?

2266
01:12:02,651 --> 01:12:04,320
He told me.

2267
01:12:04,320 --> 01:12:08,324
He told me he took her.

2268
01:12:08,324 --> 01:12:12,228
He took her because he thought

2269
01:12:12,228 --> 01:12:14,230
That her family didn't want her

2270
01:12:14,230 --> 01:12:20,136
And that she was alone, and he

2271
01:12:20,136 --> 01:12:23,739
Felt that people that had mental

2272
01:12:23,739 --> 01:12:25,107
Handicaps and that shouldn't be

2273
01:12:25,107 --> 01:12:27,042
Alive...

2274
01:12:31,448 --> 01:12:34,182
Not thinking that people would

2275
01:12:34,182 --> 01:12:37,353
Appreciate or care for or like

2276
01:12:37,353 --> 01:12:38,522
Someone who has a mental

2277
01:12:38,522 --> 01:12:42,859
Handicap.

2278
01:12:42,859 --> 01:12:46,062
Andre believed that these

2279
01:12:46,062 --> 01:12:48,865
Young girls came from families

2280
01:12:48,865 --> 01:12:51,468
That they couldn't give them

2281
01:12:51,468 --> 01:12:53,537
Anything, so the best thing was

2282
01:12:53,537 --> 01:12:57,040
That they weren't around.

2283
01:12:57,040 --> 01:12:58,542
He seemed to think it was

2284
01:12:58,542 --> 01:13:01,511
Part of his mission to cleanse

2285
01:13:01,511 --> 01:13:04,380
The world of...

2286
01:13:04,380 --> 01:13:06,915
"Imperfect children" in his

2287
01:13:06,915 --> 01:13:09,618
Eyes.

2288
01:13:09,618 --> 01:13:11,154
Due to the fact that his

2289
01:13:11,154 --> 01:13:12,821
Mother had some sort of mental

2290
01:13:12,821 --> 01:13:15,358
Disability and the fact that he

2291
01:13:15,358 --> 01:13:17,861
Viewed these other people that

2292
01:13:17,861 --> 01:13:20,263
Were less than perfect, and I

2293
01:13:20,263 --> 01:13:22,865
Personally feel that rather than

2294
01:13:22,865 --> 01:13:26,234
See them maybe grow up and have

2295
01:13:26,234 --> 01:13:28,271
Children, he was sparing them

2296
01:13:28,271 --> 01:13:31,339
And taking them out.

2297
01:13:31,339 --> 01:13:33,443
One of my sons is mentally

2298
01:13:33,443 --> 01:13:35,712
Retarded, which hung around with

2299
01:13:35,712 --> 01:13:36,279
Him.

2300
01:13:36,279 --> 01:13:38,246
His name's chippy.

2301
01:13:38,246 --> 01:13:41,951
And that's probably what drawn

2302
01:13:41,951 --> 01:13:48,356
Him to...

2303
01:13:48,356 --> 01:13:51,461
Well, to us, because of chippy

2304
01:13:51,461 --> 01:13:54,797
Being the way he is.

2305
01:13:54,797 --> 01:13:56,933
I think he's possessed.

2306
01:13:56,933 --> 01:13:58,702
I really think that he is

2307
01:13:58,702 --> 01:14:03,006
Demonized and possessed.

2308
01:14:03,006 --> 01:14:04,440
We had the same questions

2309
01:14:04,440 --> 01:14:06,341
That you're asking me... why did

2310
01:14:06,341 --> 01:14:07,109
He do this?

2311
01:14:07,109 --> 01:14:08,144
What set him off?

2312
01:14:08,144 --> 01:14:09,745
Believe me, we were wide-open

2313
01:14:09,745 --> 01:14:11,080
For any type of motive.

2314
01:14:11,080 --> 01:14:12,516
When we did interview him

2315
01:14:12,516 --> 01:14:14,149
Finally, there was gonna be a

2316
01:14:14,149 --> 01:14:15,651
Final interview, and we were

2317
01:14:15,651 --> 01:14:17,385
Gonna take him back through his

2318
01:14:17,385 --> 01:14:19,087
Alibi, and that's why we rented

2319
01:14:19,087 --> 01:14:20,923
A hotel room.

2320
01:14:20,923 --> 01:14:22,058
We said, "Andre, look, we got"

2321
01:14:22,058 --> 01:14:23,091
This tape of willowbrook.

2322
01:14:23,091 --> 01:14:24,193
Remember you used to work at

2323
01:14:24,193 --> 01:14:24,793
"Willowbrook?"

2324
01:14:24,793 --> 01:14:25,894
"Oh yeah, it was terrible."

2325
01:14:25,894 --> 01:14:26,763
I said, "remember how"

2326
01:14:26,763 --> 01:14:27,964
Geraldo Rivera did the exposé?"

2327
01:14:27,964 --> 01:14:29,032
He said, "yeah, but I never"

2328
01:14:29,032 --> 01:14:29,499
Saw it."

2329
01:14:29,499 --> 01:14:30,266
"Well, we have it."

2330
01:14:30,266 --> 01:14:31,399
Would you like to come up and

2331
01:14:31,399 --> 01:14:31,800
See it?

2332
01:14:31,800 --> 01:14:33,002
"Cause we have a vcr up there."

2333
01:14:33,002 --> 01:14:34,070
And he said, "you know, I'd"

2334
01:14:34,070 --> 01:14:35,071
Really like that."

2335
01:14:35,071 --> 01:14:36,640
And we're saying, "well, he did"

2336
01:14:36,640 --> 01:14:38,041
Work at willowbrook for two

2337
01:14:38,041 --> 01:14:38,542
Years.

2338
01:14:38,542 --> 01:14:39,976
He was a physical therapist.

2339
01:14:39,976 --> 01:14:41,511
Maybe there's something on that

2340
01:14:41,545 --> 01:14:46,849
"Tape that's gonna shake him."

2341
01:14:46,849 --> 01:14:48,251
Perhaps the governor can

2342
01:14:48,251 --> 01:14:49,653
Defend and explain away the

2343
01:14:49,653 --> 01:14:51,219
Budget cuts for the department

2344
01:14:51,219 --> 01:14:52,756
Of mental hygiene, and perhaps

2345
01:14:52,756 --> 01:14:54,123
Dr. Miller can explain and

2346
01:14:54,123 --> 01:14:55,692
Defend the filthy, dehumanizing

2347
01:14:55,692 --> 01:14:57,292
Conditions we found in this and

2348
01:14:57,292 --> 01:14:58,827
Other buildings, but they won't

2349
01:14:58,861 --> 01:15:00,597
Do it on this program.

2350
01:15:00,597 --> 01:15:02,031
What we found and documented

2351
01:15:02,031 --> 01:15:03,667
Here is a disgrace to all of us.

2352
01:15:03,667 --> 01:15:04,500
This place isn't a school.

2353
01:15:04,500 --> 01:15:06,435
It's a dark corner where we

2354
01:15:06,435 --> 01:15:08,071
Throw children who aren't pretty

2355
01:15:08,071 --> 01:15:08,772
To look at.

2356
01:15:08,772 --> 01:15:10,073
It's the big town's leper

2357
01:15:10,073 --> 01:15:12,008
Colony.

2358
01:15:22,018 --> 01:15:23,519
We were sitting on both sides

2359
01:15:23,519 --> 01:15:24,120
Of him...

2360
01:15:24,120 --> 01:15:25,321
And he started to cry.

2361
01:15:25,321 --> 01:15:26,389
He started to cry.

2362
01:15:26,389 --> 01:15:27,856
And he said, "do you see how"

2363
01:15:27,856 --> 01:15:28,356
It was?

2364
01:15:28,356 --> 01:15:29,357
You see how it was?

2365
01:15:29,357 --> 01:15:30,793
"We were victims, too," meaning

2366
01:15:30,793 --> 01:15:32,128
The attendants or the people

2367
01:15:32,128 --> 01:15:38,101
That worked there.

2368
01:15:38,101 --> 01:15:39,501
He just sat there, and his eyes,

2369
01:15:39,501 --> 01:15:40,670
Like, rolled, and he just

2370
01:15:40,670 --> 01:15:41,970
Started drooling in the hotel

2371
01:15:41,970 --> 01:15:44,240
Room.

2372
01:15:44,240 --> 01:15:45,273
We could see what was

2373
01:15:45,273 --> 01:15:46,576
Happening to him, and it's like

2374
01:15:46,576 --> 01:15:47,843
You would kneel right in front

2375
01:15:47,843 --> 01:15:49,813
Of him.

2376
01:15:49,813 --> 01:15:50,345
"Say it.

2377
01:15:50,345 --> 01:15:51,479
Tell us the truth now."

2378
01:15:51,479 --> 01:15:52,781
You know, "God will forgive"

2379
01:15:52,781 --> 01:15:55,450
You."

2380
01:15:55,450 --> 01:15:56,319
We were so close.

2381
01:15:56,319 --> 01:15:57,320
We thought we had it.

2382
01:15:57,320 --> 01:16:02,390
Then he just started to rock.

2383
01:16:02,390 --> 01:16:03,859
He was that way that whole

2384
01:16:03,859 --> 01:16:04,560
Night, the whole next day, and

2385
01:16:04,560 --> 01:16:06,729
He didn't start talking to

2386
01:16:06,729 --> 01:16:08,264
People until two or three days

2387
01:16:08,264 --> 01:16:10,199
Later.

2388
01:16:22,245 --> 01:16:24,012
As much as it had started, in

2389
01:16:24,012 --> 01:16:25,615
The end, it all came back to

2390
01:16:25,615 --> 01:16:28,483
Willowbrook.

2391
01:16:28,483 --> 01:16:29,918
Were the answers to these

2392
01:16:29,918 --> 01:16:31,353
Missing children found on

2393
01:16:31,353 --> 01:16:33,989
Geraldo's tape?

2394
01:16:33,989 --> 01:16:35,523
And if so, had the sins of

2395
01:16:35,523 --> 01:16:37,392
Willowbrook finally come back to

2396
01:16:37,392 --> 01:16:39,863
Haunt the residents of

2397
01:16:39,863 --> 01:16:43,331
Staten island?

2398
01:16:43,331 --> 01:16:46,102
All news, all the time.

2399
01:16:46,102 --> 01:16:48,137
This is 1010 wins.

2400
01:16:48,137 --> 01:16:50,373
You give us 22 minutes, we'll

2401
01:16:50,373 --> 01:16:51,974
Give you the world.

2402
01:16:51,974 --> 01:16:54,143
A guilty verdict 23 years

2403
01:16:54,143 --> 01:16:55,010
After 7-year-old

2404
01:16:55,010 --> 01:16:56,478
Holly Ann Hughes vanished from

2405
01:16:56,478 --> 01:16:57,814
Outside of her staten island

2406
01:16:57,814 --> 01:16:58,247
Home.

2407
01:16:58,247 --> 01:16:59,581
This is the heroes right

2408
01:16:59,581 --> 01:16:59,982
Here.

2409
01:16:59,982 --> 01:17:01,284
Heroes, heroes, heroes,

2410
01:17:01,284 --> 01:17:01,751
Heroes.

2411
01:17:01,751 --> 01:17:02,550
He's a killer.

2412
01:17:02,550 --> 01:17:04,620
He's a killer and a kidnapper.

2413
01:17:04,620 --> 01:17:06,655
Tell us where she is.

2414
01:17:06,655 --> 01:17:08,124
Tell us where the other kids

2415
01:17:08,124 --> 01:17:08,523
Are.

2416
01:17:08,523 --> 01:17:09,693
I'll go look for them.

2417
01:17:09,693 --> 01:17:10,592
I'll find them.

2418
01:17:10,592 --> 01:17:12,161
The other ones, of course, yes.

2419
01:17:12,161 --> 01:17:13,261
There's speculation.

2420
01:17:13,261 --> 01:17:14,897
But we will make sure that those

2421
01:17:14,897 --> 01:17:16,499
Cases someday come to trial and

2422
01:17:16,499 --> 01:17:18,066
That the rest of those families

2423
01:17:18,066 --> 01:17:19,567
Have the same type of justice

2424
01:17:19,567 --> 01:17:21,036
That the schweiger's and the

2425
01:17:21,036 --> 01:17:23,605
Hughes have.

2426
01:17:23,605 --> 01:17:25,008
A lot of weight is lifted off

2427
01:17:25,008 --> 01:17:25,709
Me right now.

2428
01:17:25,709 --> 01:17:26,541
I feel better.

2429
01:17:26,541 --> 01:17:27,944
Do you feel any closure about

2430
01:17:27,944 --> 01:17:30,412
The verdict?

2431
01:17:30,412 --> 01:17:33,782
Well, you know, it...

2432
01:17:33,782 --> 01:17:34,850
It's not gonna bring back

2433
01:17:34,850 --> 01:17:35,384
Holly Ann.

2434
01:17:35,384 --> 01:17:36,051
You know that.

2435
01:17:36,051 --> 01:17:38,354
But...

2436
01:17:38,354 --> 01:17:39,521
[ Voice breaking ] She's

2437
01:17:39,521 --> 01:17:40,088
Watching.

2438
01:17:40,088 --> 01:17:40,857
That's enough.

2439
01:17:40,857 --> 01:17:42,358
Well, the killer had a lot of

2440
01:17:42,358 --> 01:17:43,693
Nicknames... the pied Piper,

2441
01:17:43,693 --> 01:17:45,093
Hannibal lechter, the bogeyman

2442
01:17:45,093 --> 01:17:45,994
Of staten island.

2443
01:17:45,994 --> 01:17:47,230
His victims were among the

2444
01:17:47,230 --> 01:17:48,096
Most vulnerable.

2445
01:17:48,096 --> 01:17:49,064
They were children.

2446
01:17:49,064 --> 01:17:50,366
And tonight, prosecutors are

2447
01:17:50,366 --> 01:17:51,835
Making sure that predator stays

2448
01:17:51,835 --> 01:17:52,936
Behind bars.

2449
01:17:52,936 --> 01:17:55,304
23 years ago, the entire city

2450
01:17:55,304 --> 01:17:57,673
Was transfixed with the image of

2451
01:17:57,673 --> 01:18:00,008
An innocent 7-year-old girl who

2452
01:18:00,008 --> 01:18:02,245
Disappeared in the blink of an

2453
01:18:02,245 --> 01:18:02,812
Eye.

2454
01:18:02,812 --> 01:18:04,680
Sadly, holly Ann Hughes has

2455
01:18:04,680 --> 01:18:08,384
Never made it home.

2456
01:18:08,384 --> 01:18:12,588
Mr. rand...

2457
01:18:12,588 --> 01:18:14,456
What the conviction today

2458
01:18:14,456 --> 01:18:15,958
Does is assure us that

2459
01:18:15,958 --> 01:18:17,927
Andre rand will die in prison.

2460
01:18:17,927 --> 01:18:19,895
Andre rand was sentenced 25

2461
01:18:19,895 --> 01:18:21,998
Years to life for the kidnapping

2462
01:18:21,998 --> 01:18:23,398
Of holly Ann Hughes.

2463
01:18:23,398 --> 01:18:25,368
He will be eligible for parole

2464
01:18:25,368 --> 01:18:27,737
In 2037.

2465
01:18:27,737 --> 01:18:31,106
He will be 93 years old.

2466
01:18:31,106 --> 01:18:32,008
Ooh.

2467
01:18:32,008 --> 01:18:32,776
Yeah.

2468
01:18:32,776 --> 01:18:35,110
No matter how horrible the

2469
01:18:35,110 --> 01:18:37,713
Allegation was, this case was

2470
01:18:37,713 --> 01:18:40,048
Hardly a case where it was

2471
01:18:40,048 --> 01:18:44,052
Proved conclusively that this

2472
01:18:44,052 --> 01:18:45,822
Guy committed this crime.

2473
01:18:45,822 --> 01:18:47,924
That just goes to show, when

2474
01:18:47,924 --> 01:18:50,058
It comes to a child is hurt, an

2475
01:18:50,058 --> 01:18:53,061
Innocent child is lost...

2476
01:18:53,061 --> 01:18:54,397
You know, people want to

2477
01:18:54,397 --> 01:18:55,563
Basically lynch you.

2478
01:18:55,563 --> 01:18:57,165
And if they had an opportunity

2479
01:18:57,165 --> 01:18:58,700
To lynch anybody, they would

2480
01:18:58,700 --> 01:18:59,435
Lynch rand.

2481
01:18:59,435 --> 01:19:01,103
Did you ever think you would

2482
01:19:01,103 --> 01:19:03,807
Get to this day?

2483
01:19:03,807 --> 01:19:06,109
No.

2484
01:19:06,109 --> 01:19:08,043
No, never thought I'd get

2485
01:19:08,043 --> 01:19:08,643
Here.

2486
01:19:08,643 --> 01:19:10,746
I don't feel like I got closure

2487
01:19:10,746 --> 01:19:11,447
At all.

2488
01:19:11,447 --> 01:19:13,549
You know, I mean, you never get

2489
01:19:13,549 --> 01:19:15,383
Closure, and that's just a

2490
01:19:15,383 --> 01:19:16,785
Bullshit word, too.

2491
01:19:16,785 --> 01:19:18,887
I mean, it happened, and that's

2492
01:19:18,887 --> 01:19:20,656
It.

2493
01:19:20,656 --> 01:19:21,791
You got to live with it.

2494
01:19:21,791 --> 01:19:22,758
You have no choice.

2495
01:19:22,758 --> 01:19:23,927
I'd just like to find her

2496
01:19:23,927 --> 01:19:26,728
Remains and...

2497
01:19:26,728 --> 01:19:31,466
Put it to rest.

2498
01:19:31,466 --> 01:19:32,734
Actually, part of the

2499
01:19:32,734 --> 01:19:34,102
Testimony in this case, he

2500
01:19:34,102 --> 01:19:35,703
Claimed that we were looking in

2501
01:19:35,703 --> 01:19:36,604
The wrong spot.

2502
01:19:36,604 --> 01:19:37,705
Well, you know what?

2503
01:19:37,705 --> 01:19:39,207
I'll make sure we look in the

2504
01:19:39,207 --> 01:19:39,909
Right spot.

2505
01:19:39,909 --> 01:19:41,143
Where would that be?

2506
01:19:41,143 --> 01:19:42,644
That's willowbrook.

2507
01:19:42,644 --> 01:19:44,547
Now's the time to use what we

2508
01:19:44,547 --> 01:19:46,581
Learned from this one to reopen

2509
01:19:46,581 --> 01:19:48,250
Another one of the cases.

2510
01:19:48,250 --> 01:19:50,152
I think he likes playing this

2511
01:19:50,152 --> 01:19:51,387
Little head game.

2512
01:19:51,387 --> 01:19:53,356
I think we're gonna get little

2513
01:19:53,356 --> 01:19:58,061
Hints over the next few years.

2514
01:19:58,061 --> 01:19:59,727
You know, he likes to be the

2515
01:19:59,727 --> 01:20:01,430
Center of attention, the one

2516
01:20:01,430 --> 01:20:03,131
That holds... the keeper of the

2517
01:20:03,131 --> 01:20:04,766
Secrets, and I think that's

2518
01:20:04,766 --> 01:20:06,402
Gonna play a real important

2519
01:20:06,402 --> 01:20:06,802
Part.

2520
01:20:06,802 --> 01:20:08,103
Donna, just say your full

2521
01:20:08,103 --> 01:20:09,471
Name for me, and tell me again

2522
01:20:09,471 --> 01:20:10,906
The title of your organization.

2523
01:20:10,906 --> 01:20:11,406
Okay.

2524
01:20:11,406 --> 01:20:14,843
It's Donna cutugno. C-u-t-u-g...

2525
01:20:24,519 --> 01:20:26,389
Was Andre rand convicted on

2526
01:20:26,389 --> 01:20:27,490
Fact or fiction?

2527
01:20:27,490 --> 01:20:29,125
We'll probably never know.

2528
01:20:29,125 --> 01:20:30,658
But for the residents of

2529
01:20:30,658 --> 01:20:32,361
Staten island, there was no

2530
01:20:32,361 --> 01:20:33,562
Distinction.

2531
01:20:33,562 --> 01:20:35,932
He was their child murderer,

2532
01:20:35,932 --> 01:20:38,166
Their scapegoat, and their

2533
01:20:38,166 --> 01:20:40,735
Bogeyman all tightly woven into

2534
01:20:40,735 --> 01:20:45,341
One.

2535
01:20:45,341 --> 01:20:46,674
To some, Andre rand was the

2536
01:20:46,674 --> 01:20:48,011
Ringleader to an underground

2537
01:20:48,011 --> 01:20:49,545
Community of outcasts who roamed

2538
01:20:49,545 --> 01:20:51,547
The woods.

2539
01:20:51,547 --> 01:20:53,416
To others, he was an unwitting

2540
01:20:53,416 --> 01:20:55,384
Puppet, manipulated by a deviant

2541
01:20:55,384 --> 01:20:56,886
Cult that trafficked in

2542
01:20:56,886 --> 01:20:59,055
Children...

2543
01:20:59,055 --> 01:21:00,924
Or a delusion murderer, fueled

2544
01:21:00,924 --> 01:21:02,558
By our own urban failures,

2545
01:21:02,558 --> 01:21:04,527
Killing those he thought weren't

2546
01:21:04,527 --> 01:21:08,263
Worthy of living.

2547
01:21:08,263 --> 01:21:09,797
We will never know the real

2548
01:21:09,797 --> 01:21:11,500
Story behind Andre rand, so all

2549
01:21:11,500 --> 01:21:12,800
We're left with is our

2550
01:21:12,800 --> 01:21:16,538
Version, that of cropsey.

2551
01:21:16,538 --> 01:21:18,640
But now we've added another

2552
01:21:18,640 --> 01:21:21,009
Chapter for the next generation

2553
01:21:21,009 --> 01:21:22,979
Of kids on staten island.

2554
01:21:22,979 --> 01:21:25,213
The power of the urban legend

2555
01:21:25,213 --> 01:21:27,515
Is that it doesn't claim to be

2556
01:21:27,515 --> 01:21:29,752
The truth, but rather it says

2557
01:21:29,752 --> 01:21:31,586
The truth is a range of

2558
01:21:31,586 --> 01:21:33,689
Possibilities, and it's the

2559
01:21:33,689 --> 01:21:35,657
Audience who must decide.

2560
01:21:35,657 --> 01:21:37,593
So pick one.
