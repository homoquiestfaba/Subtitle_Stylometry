356
00:13:29,540 --> 00:13:31,500
Our first shelter
that we built was

357
00:13:31,510 --> 00:13:33,339
an a-frame debris shelter

358
00:13:33,340 --> 00:13:36,039
and the debris helped us
trapped in our body heat.

359
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:38,009
It worked as an
insulating layer,

360
00:13:38,010 --> 00:13:40,110

to be small enough.

had less body mass than me.

378

So you want your
fire pit like that.

379
00:14:23,530 --> 00:14:25,629
Phaedra thought that
fire was really important

380

and I thought the shelter
was really important.

381
00:14:27,494 --> 00:14:29,399
So we tried to combine the two.

382
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:31,299
I just decided, hey,
you know what?

383
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:33,499
It's time now we go black
macgyver on this, you know,

384
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:36,600
so we wanted to pretty
much make a log cabin.

385
00:14:36,610 --> 00:14:40,139
We took a lot of pine saplings
and that created our front wall

386
00:14:40,140 --> 00:14:41,209
and our sidewall.

387
00:14:41,210 --> 00:14:43,109
The gaps in between the logs,

388
00:14:43,110 --> 00:14:45,449
we filled those
with moss and mud.

389
00:14:45,450 --> 00:14:48,279
We need double this amount
if we want to be waterproof.

390
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:49,449
Okay.

391
00:14:49,450 --> 00:14:51,210
And that allowed us
to keep a lot of the heat

392
00:14:51,234 --> 00:14:52,149
enclosed in there,

393
00:14:52,150 --> 00:14:54,350
but also to keep the
elements from outside

394
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:56,659
from flowing
through really easily.

395
00:14:56,660 --> 00:14:58,689
The roof was made
of a few saplings

396
00:14:58,690 --> 00:15:01,929
and then on top of that,
we took bark off of trees

397
00:15:01,930 --> 00:15:04,629
and we used that as shingles
to help shed the water.

398
00:15:04,630 --> 00:15:06,769
The fireplace had to
be completely enclosed

399
00:15:06,770 --> 00:15:10,200
and we did that using
mud, moss, and rocks.

400

see what happens.

402

433
00:16:26,180 --> 00:16:28,679
with was sort of a
modified lean-to situation

00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:32,349
where we were stacking
sticks onto an existing tree.

435

point to help with a secure build

knew we could rely on.

strong anchor point,

Narrator: In south africa,
an experienced hunter

537
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:25,690
had to adapt his backwoods
skills to a strange land.

538
00:20:27,690 --> 00:20:30,520
I decided early on in a
challenge to go ahead

539
00:20:30,530 --> 00:20:31,690
and make a hunting implement.

540
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,899
I've been making bows
since I was like 4 years old.

541
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:39,369
I'm no stranger to
that hunting weapon,

542
00:20:39,370 --> 00:20:41,869
but I don't know the
materials out there in africa.

543
00:20:41,870 --> 00:20:45,609
So I have to trust my skills
and work with what I have

544
00:20:45,610 --> 00:20:47,070
and then hope
for the best on it.

545
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:51,140
You want pretty dense
timber to start with.

546
00:20:51,150 --> 00:20:53,279
That may work. It
very well may work.

547
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:56,149
My normal rule of thumb
with making a long bow

548
00:20:56,150 --> 00:20:58,619
is I make the bow as
tall as the shooter is,

549
00:20:58,620 --> 00:21:00,660
because if we have a little
short bow with the limbs

550
00:21:00,684 --> 00:21:02,319
you've got to bend
back so much further

551
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:04,559
it's more likely to bust.

552
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:07,659
As far as bow wood, you
want a hard, dense wood

553
00:21:07,660 --> 00:21:09,899
because if you have
something that's real sluggish

554
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:12,299
and weak, well, it's either
gonna break or when you pull it,

555
00:21:12,300 --> 00:21:13,799
it's gonna be bent.

556
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:15,599
What are you
using for the arrow?

557
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:17,369
That square stuff I
do for a hand drill.

558
00:21:17,370 --> 00:21:19,809
It works great. I'm
gonna see what happens.

559
00:21:19,810 --> 00:21:21,539
The biggest thing is
having a good arrow

560
00:21:21,540 --> 00:21:23,479
because if you don't, if
you don't take your time

561
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:25,240
and flesh it right,
you'll have a strand.

562
00:21:25,250 --> 00:21:27,279
And a strand and six
inches don't seem like much

563
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:29,649
until you -- until you're
shooting at a rabbit,

564
00:21:29,650 --> 00:21:30,719
you know?

565
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:32,519
You need it
straight, very straight,

566
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:34,819
and there's not a lot of
straight sticks in nature.

567
00:21:34,820 --> 00:21:37,420
So you improvise,
use fire, heat it up,

568
00:21:37,430 --> 00:21:38,830
bend it into place
where you need it

569
00:21:38,854 --> 00:21:40,089
and straighten it.

570
00:21:40,090 --> 00:21:41,159
I heat it up right here,

571
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:43,599
I hold it place once it's hot,

572
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:48,030
and once I let go, it'll
stay. It's pretty neat.

573
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:49,439
One trick to measure an arrow,

574
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:54,909
you take the end of the
arrow, put it on your throat,

575
00:21:54,910 --> 00:21:58,009
my middle fingers where
they end right there,

576
00:21:58,010 --> 00:22:00,379
that's how long
your arrow should be.

577
00:22:00,380 --> 00:22:02,079
There it is.

578
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:05,319
This arrow right here is
tipped with a piece of bone.

579
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:07,389
You know, the
penetration's not very deep.

580
00:22:07,390 --> 00:22:08,950
With the arrowhead,
you can sharpen

581
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:11,289
the end of the stick
and it would work,

582
00:22:11,290 --> 00:22:12,789
but I want a bigger
cutting blade.

583
00:22:12,790 --> 00:22:15,390
So what I do is I take a
piece of bone, I sharpen it up,

584
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:17,729
tie it up with some
cordage, works great.

585
00:22:17,730 --> 00:22:19,370
What the feathers do,
they guide the arrow

586
00:22:19,394 --> 00:22:21,369
in a straight path
as they do a bird.

587
00:22:21,370 --> 00:22:23,239
Baobab, tree of life.

588
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:26,339
For the cordage, I go
back to the baobab tree.

589
00:22:26,340 --> 00:22:27,639
It made really good cordage

590
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:29,709
because the
elephants would strip it,

591
00:22:29,710 --> 00:22:30,809
then they would chew on it.

592
00:22:30,810 --> 00:22:32,240
So it was pliable.

593
00:22:32,250 --> 00:22:35,649
Twist clockwise,
wrap counterclockwise.

594
00:22:35,650 --> 00:22:37,890

holds the whole thing together

how I can create one of
those with natural materials.

658

is a pretty basic concept,

if you've ever seen a
dog catcher using one.

The next piece of
material I needed

was a durable vine.

663

And that's gonna be the noose.

664
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:03,459
So it'll be a noose at one end

665
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:05,060
and I'm gonna pull
it from the other end

666
00:25:05,070 --> 00:25:06,729
once we get it around
the gator's neck.

And in order to
fasten that noose,

668
00:25:09,100 --> 00:25:13,339

make a bunch of fixed circles.

At the very end of

673
00:25:20,354 --> 00:25:22,149
And by fixing these circles,

674
00:25:22,150 --> 00:25:24,049

the top of the pole,

through all the fixed circles.

So once you pull it through,
that noose on the end

cinches tighter together.

00:39:58,290 --> 00:40:01,029
Well...

1046
00:40:01,030 --> 00:40:04,029
There, what do you think?
- It's [bleep] tight.

1047
00:40:04,030 --> 00:40:07,129
- So I'm gonna be sitting here.
- Yep.

1048
00:40:07,130 --> 00:40:08,930
And I'll be sitting
right back there.

1049
00:40:08,940 --> 00:40:13,300
♪

1050
00:40:13,310 --> 00:40:14,739
Are you ready
to grab onto the...

1051
00:40:14,740 --> 00:40:18,209
Yeah.

1052
00:40:18,210 --> 00:40:20,109
This is sailing.
We're sailing for real.

1053
00:40:20,110 --> 00:40:22,249
Good work. Nailed it.

1054
00:40:22,250 --> 00:40:24,249
I was so proud to
have pulled it together

1055
00:40:24,250 --> 00:40:26,649
and made something that
actually worked out there.

1056
00:40:26,650 --> 00:40:28,350
Do you want to go in
between the islands?

1057
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:29,689
Yeah.

1058
00:40:29,690 --> 00:40:31,730
Sarah: We were cruising
out of there like champions.

1059
00:40:31,754 --> 00:40:32,559
Ha ha.

1060
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:34,240
And I don't think that
I could have done it

1061
00:40:34,264 --> 00:40:36,529
without my ingenuity.

1062
00:40:36,530 --> 00:40:37,929
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

1063
00:40:37,930 --> 00:40:40,429
We did it. We did it.

1064
00:40:40,430 --> 00:40:44,469
Adios, exuma!

1065
00:40:44,470 --> 00:40:46,969
Every stroke burns.

1066
00:40:46,970 --> 00:40:49,870
Dig in deep, ej, I
know you're on empty.

1067
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:51,479
It was this great
sense of pride,

1068
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:54,779
this great sense
of accomplishment.

1069
00:40:54,780 --> 00:40:56,610
- There is a boil.
- [ exhales ]

1070
00:40:56,620 --> 00:41:00,249
that we use this ingenuity
to adapt and overcome,

1071
00:41:00,250 --> 00:41:02,319
to really win out at the end.

1072
00:41:02,320 --> 00:41:03,819
Every environment's different.

1073
00:41:03,820 --> 00:41:05,820
You never know what
you're gonna run into.

1074
00:41:05,830 --> 00:41:07,029
Cordage is breaking.

1075
00:41:07,030 --> 00:41:08,829
So creativity is essential.

1076
00:41:08,830 --> 00:41:11,029
That's it. We're able
to start hunting now.

1077
00:41:11,030 --> 00:41:12,660
In a survival situation,

1078
00:41:12,670 --> 00:41:15,530
I've always felt that
brains versus brawn

1079
00:41:15,540 --> 00:41:17,769
will win nine out of 10 times.

1080
00:41:17,770 --> 00:41:21,269
We did it. I'm so proud of you.

1081
00:41:21,270 --> 00:41:23,270
Improvise, adapt, and overcome.

1082
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:26,679
- Ah! Yeah!
- Whoo!

1083
00:41:26,680 --> 00:41:27,949
We [bleep] did it!

1084
00:41:27,950 --> 00:41:28,950
That's survival.

1085
00:41:28,951 --> 00:41:31,649
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

1086
00:41:31,650 --> 00:41:34,220
Bye, amazon, thank you!
