- [man] I got her onboard,

85
00:06:00,577 --> 00:06:02,212
so where's that ship
you promised me?

86
00:06:02,346 --> 00:06:04,214
You're lucky you're
standing on this one.

You're late.

91
00:06:15,925 --> 00:06:18,028
Hi, sir. I'm, uh, Noah.

92
00:06:18,162 --> 00:06:20,830
Let me guess.
You are the dead man walking

93
00:06:20,964 --> 00:06:22,832
that knocked up
my unmarried daughter

94
00:06:22,966 --> 00:06:24,301
and made her drop out
of West Point.

95
00:06:24,435 --> 00:06:26,303
No, this is not.
This man helped us.

96
00:06:26,437 --> 00:06:28,871
He helped us get on the ship,
saved my life,

97
00:06:29,006 --> 00:06:30,907
saved our lives.

98
00:06:32,409 --> 00:06:33,610
Is that right?

99
00:06:36,213 --> 00:06:38,182
I guess I owe you.

100
00:06:38,315 --> 00:06:39,849
No, sir.

101
00:06:42,152 --> 00:06:43,420

I don't get
why you don't tell him.

Your dad's
gonna find out eventually.

106
00:07:17,087 --> 00:07:19,590
I know. I can't wait
for him to know you.

107
00:07:19,723 --> 00:07:22,025
[chuckles] I just want that
to be in an environment

108
00:07:22,159 --> 00:07:23,761

open a window and...

109

Mm-hmm.

113
00:07:35,005 --> 00:07:36,173

114
00:07:36,306 --> 00:07:39,009
Yeah. Man in overalls...

359
00:23:58,789 --> 00:24:00,557
Moxacell.

360
00:24:00,691 --> 00:24:02,393
"Extreme cleaning power."

361
00:24:07,765 --> 00:24:08,966
[hissing]

362
00:24:09,099 --> 00:24:10,734
Fuck.

363
00:24:10,868 --> 00:24:12,169
Oh, shit.

364
00:24:13,103 --> 00:24:14,338
Shit.

365
00:24:18,776 --> 00:24:20,043
[sighs]

366
00:24:23,113 --> 00:24:25,582
"One drop per gallon of water."

367
00:24:27,117 --> 00:24:28,619
Come on.

368
00:24:35,492 --> 00:24:36,527
[stomach gurgles]

369
00:24:38,729 --> 00:24:40,364
[gurgling]

370
00:24:41,665 --> 00:24:43,200
- Blue!
- Huh?

371
00:24:43,333 --> 00:24:45,002
Hurry it up, will you?

372
00:24:45,135 --> 00:24:47,337
What the fuck is the rush?

373
00:24:50,073 --> 00:24:52,376
- [lighter flicks]
- Oh, God.

374
00:24:53,710 --> 00:24:56,613
[groans] Oh, yeah.

375
00:24:58,148 --> 00:25:00,950
[laughs] We ain't
getting anything done.

376
00:25:01,084 --> 00:25:03,454
[laughs]

377
00:25:05,422 --> 00:25:06,723
Anyway, I'm so fucking high,

378
00:25:06,857 --> 00:25:08,826
I couldn't even think
about working right now.

379
00:25:08,959 --> 00:25:10,627
- Fuck that.
- [stomach gurgling]

380

[groans]

381
00:25:12,296 --> 00:25:13,597
What's up, man?

382
00:25:13,730 --> 00:25:15,599
I drank something earlier.
[groans]

383
00:25:15,732 --> 00:25:17,100
You're starting
to freak me out, brother.

384
00:25:17,234 --> 00:25:18,402
- [screams]
- Whoa!

385
00:25:18,535 --> 00:25:19,803
Seriously,
you fucking with me?

386
00:25:19,937 --> 00:25:21,905
- [screaming]
- Whoa! What, what, what?

387
00:25:22,039 --> 00:25:23,207
Oh, God! Ohh! Call Chambers!

388
00:25:23,340 --> 00:25:24,274
What do you mean,
"Call Chambers?"

389
00:25:24,408 --> 00:25:25,442
Call her now! [screams]

390
00:25:25,576 --> 00:25:27,344
What? Whoa, whoa!
Just get it out!

391
00:25:27,478 --> 00:25:28,912
- What the fuck are you doing?
- Get it out!

392
00:25:29,046 --> 00:25:31,315
Get what out?
You're fucking freaking me out!

393
00:25:32,816 --> 00:25:36,253
I'm burning! Agh!
Agh! It's burning!

394
00:25:36,386 --> 00:25:37,554
- Drink this!
- It's burns!

395
00:25:37,688 --> 00:25:39,223
Drink this!

396
00:25:44,595 --> 00:25:46,163
Good. Drink it.

397
00:25:47,865 --> 00:25:48,799
[thermos clangs]

398
00:25:48,932 --> 00:25:50,067
Oh, my God.

399
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:52,669
Are you all right? You okay?

400
00:25:52,803 --> 00:25:54,304
Say something, bro.

401
00:25:54,438 --> 00:25:56,273
Say something. Shady.

402
00:25:56,406 --> 00:25:57,841
- [belches]
- Shady!

403
00:25:57,976 --> 00:25:59,843

404
00:25:59,978 --> 00:26:01,478
What do you know?

405
00:26:03,213 --> 00:26:05,048
Heartburn.

406
00:26:05,182 --> 00:26:06,116
Heartburn?

407
00:26:06,250 --> 00:26:07,551
[chuckles]

408
00:26:07,684 --> 00:26:09,119
You fucking idiot.

409
00:26:09,253 --> 00:26:11,655
- [grunts]
- What...

410
00:26:12,856 --> 00:26:14,358

00:26:49,893 --> 00:26:52,596
- [intercom chirps]
- Clay, I finished the floors.

416
00:26:57,067 --> 00:26:59,236
Clay, can I go?

417
00:27:10,147 --> 00:27:11,448
Clay!

418
00:27:31,401 --> 00:27:33,337
Clay, you in there?

419
00:27:39,109 --> 00:27:40,777
[fluttering]

420
00:27:41,778 --> 00:27:44,514

[Moxacell pouring]

422
00:28:24,956 --> 00:28:26,057
[hinge creaks]

423
00:28:26,189 --> 00:28:28,158
- What are you doing?
- [gasps]

424
00:28:30,694 --> 00:28:33,196
- Uh...
- You following me?

425
00:28:33,330 --> 00:28:35,899
- I...
- Let me ask you a question.

426
00:28:39,770 --> 00:28:41,905
- Sit down.
- What is all this?

427
00:28:42,439 --> 00:28:44,174
I said sit down!

428
00:28:58,388 --> 00:28:59,656
No, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no!

429
00:28:59,790 --> 00:29:01,425
- I just finished my shift. I...
- I saw Clay

430
00:29:01,558 --> 00:29:02,960
stealing jet fuel,
and he had Moxacell.

431
00:29:03,094 --> 00:29:05,228
- What? Spit it out.
- Clay's making a fucking bomb!

432
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,467
Is that true, Clay?

433
00:29:15,039 --> 00:29:16,373
You got him?

434
00:29:21,344 --> 00:29:22,412
Right. Let's go.

435
00:29:22,546 --> 00:29:24,548
Come on! Stand up!

436
00:29:33,623 --> 00:29:35,358
I didn't see anything.

437
00:29:36,526 --> 00:29:37,694
Did you bring it?

438
00:29:37,828 --> 00:29:40,263
Do you want to start,
or should I?

439
00:29:40,397 --> 00:29:41,498
You know, he knows about you.

440
00:29:41,631 --> 00:29:43,567
What exactly
does the commander know?

441
00:29:43,700 --> 00:29:45,569
That you're
with the rebellion.

442
00:29:45,702 --> 00:29:47,671
That you're trying
to blow up the ship,

443
00:29:47,804 --> 00:29:49,974
trying to get revenge for all
those people you left behind.

444
00:29:50,108 --> 00:29:51,075
He said all that, huh?

445
00:29:51,209 --> 00:29:52,409
And if anything happens to me,

446
00:29:52,542 --> 00:29:53,844
he's gonna go looking.

447
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:59,382
You guys should move back.
This could get messy.

448
00:30:03,386 --> 00:30:05,589
[grunts]

449
00:30:06,958 --> 00:30:08,325
Make it easy, kid.

450
00:30:08,458 --> 00:30:10,427
Open your mouth.

451
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:12,230
No, please.
I'm not gonna say anything.

452
00:30:12,362 --> 00:30:14,331
Open your mouth.

453
00:30:14,464 --> 00:30:16,100
Please, I have a family.
I have a family.

454
00:30:16,234 --> 00:30:18,568
[gurgles]

455
00:30:23,306 --> 00:30:25,742
[coughing]

456
00:30:27,344 --> 00:30:28,980
- [chuckles]
- [Noah] What the fuck?

457
00:30:30,313 --> 00:30:32,183
Wait. So you're not making
a bomb. You're making...

458
00:30:32,315 --> 00:30:33,784
Moonshine.

459
00:30:33,917 --> 00:30:35,987
[laughs] Well,
it's mostly acid cleaner.

460
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:38,455
So... So you're not trying
to blow up the ship?

461
00:30:38,588 --> 00:30:39,723
What the hell
are you talking about?

462
00:30:39,856 --> 00:30:41,192
I saw you stealing fuel cells.

463
00:30:41,324 --> 00:30:43,326
Jet fuel,
gives it a good kick.

464
00:30:43,460 --> 00:30:45,029
Torpedo Clay's special recipe.

465
00:30:46,663 --> 00:30:50,234
So now that we know
and we know that you know,

466
00:30:50,367 --> 00:30:55,206
we, uh, think it's best
that we keep this between us.

467
00:30:55,338 --> 00:30:56,606
If Commander Stanley finds out,

468
00:30:56,740 --> 00:31:00,677
we are all looking
at a court-martial,

469
00:31:00,811 --> 00:31:02,579
all of us.

470
00:31:02,712 --> 00:31:03,914
And if I don't?

471
00:31:04,048 --> 00:31:06,150
[laughs]

472
00:31:06,284 --> 00:31:07,551
Blackmailing me?

473
00:31:12,522 --> 00:31:13,456
[sighs]

474
00:31:13,590 --> 00:31:15,592
Got 84 days.

475
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:18,328
[Clay] What do you say?

476
00:31:23,433 --> 00:31:24,868
[coughs]

477
00:31:26,304 --> 00:31:27,504
All right!

478
00:31:27,637 --> 00:31:28,805
Let's have some fun.

479
00:31:28,939 --> 00:31:31,275
What do you think? [laughs]

480
00:31:31,408 --> 00:31:33,443
[music playing]

481
00:31:33,577 --> 00:31:35,712
[crew chattering]

482
00:31:38,983 --> 00:31:40,684
- Oh, what was that?
- Hear, hear.

483
00:31:44,155 --> 00:31:47,191
- [laughs]
- [laughs]

484
00:31:47,325 --> 00:31:50,061
[music playing over video]

485
00:31:54,631 --> 00:31:56,133
We can confiscate their booze.

486
00:32:01,571 --> 00:32:02,974
So they paid an ad agency

487
00:32:03,107 --> 00:32:05,076
to come up with
the phrase "New Earth."

488
00:32:05,209 --> 00:32:07,011
I mean, shit,
I could come up with that.

489
00:32:07,144 --> 00:32:09,446
New Earth.
We fucked up the old,

490
00:32:09,579 --> 00:32:11,581
so here's a new one.

491
00:32:11,715 --> 00:32:13,383
My brother made it
on the first ship.

492
00:32:13,516 --> 00:32:15,452
Who do you have
waiting for you?

493
00:32:16,853 --> 00:32:17,587
Nobody.

494
00:32:17,721 --> 00:32:18,688
Just your family?

495
00:32:18,822 --> 00:32:20,091
I don't have a family.

496
00:32:20,224 --> 00:32:22,492
I thought you told us
you had a family.

497
00:32:23,526 --> 00:32:26,030
Um, back on Earth.

498
00:32:26,163 --> 00:32:28,798
Just my mom,
and she had to stay behind.

499
00:32:29,766 --> 00:32:31,601
So it's just me now.

500
00:32:35,705 --> 00:32:37,008
There was a girl.

501
00:32:37,141 --> 00:32:38,942
Ah, here we go.

502
00:32:39,076 --> 00:32:40,744
Alex.

503
00:32:42,113 --> 00:32:43,413
A real lady.

504
00:32:43,546 --> 00:32:45,149
[Ortega] Hmm.

505
00:32:45,283 --> 00:32:47,450
She married my brother.

506
00:32:47,584 --> 00:32:48,718
[laughs]

507
00:32:48,852 --> 00:32:51,055
She married your brother?

508
00:32:51,188 --> 00:32:52,189
Is he still breathing?

509
00:32:52,323 --> 00:32:54,457
Clay's a lover, not a fighter.

510
00:32:54,591 --> 00:32:55,859
Ain't that right?

511
00:32:55,993 --> 00:32:58,528
One day, you're young, and...

512
00:32:58,662 --> 00:32:59,863
you got the world at your feet.

513
00:32:59,997 --> 00:33:04,068
And the next, you're, well...

514
00:33:04,935 --> 00:33:06,903
whatever the fuck we are.

515
00:33:07,904 --> 00:33:10,540
I'm gonna go find me some Blue.

516
00:33:10,674 --> 00:33:12,575
Where are those jackasses?

517
00:33:14,278 --> 00:33:16,646
If it's gonna fail, why go?

518
00:33:18,082 --> 00:33:20,217
Because I'm good
at failing up.

519
00:33:21,751 --> 00:33:23,687
Where are you
getting reassigned?

520
00:33:23,820 --> 00:33:25,522
- Reassigned?
- You know, the new job

521
00:33:25,655 --> 00:33:27,124
we get when we land.

522
00:33:27,258 --> 00:33:29,459
Oh. Um, butcher.

523
00:33:31,494 --> 00:33:33,630
Just not too fucking sharp.

524
00:33:39,337 --> 00:33:41,439
[footsteps echoing]

525
00:33:43,207 --> 00:33:45,608
Blucher.

526
00:33:55,618 --> 00:33:56,753
Blucher!

[sparks crackling]

530
00:34:02,492 --> 00:34:05,196
Hey, where you been hiding?

531
00:34:07,098 --> 00:34:07,931
Blue.

532
00:34:08,065 --> 00:34:10,934
You only get one chance at this.

533
00:34:13,503 --> 00:34:15,538
- [moans]
- Oh, jeez.

That's more like it.

- Clay.
- Should have known.

541
00:34:46,103 --> 00:34:48,472
First jump.
You don't know your assignment.

542
00:34:48,638 --> 00:34:49,706
Can't clean for shit.

543
00:34:49,839 --> 00:34:51,541
Please. I-I can explain.

544
00:34:51,674 --> 00:34:53,511
Good.
I'm giving you 10 seconds

545
00:34:53,643 --> 00:34:54,811
before I call Stanley.

546
00:34:54,944 --> 00:34:56,347
No, look,
you don't understand.

547
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:59,883
Five, four, three,
two, one.

548
00:35:00,017 --> 00:35:02,153
Okay, I wasn't picked
for New Earth.

549
00:35:03,054 --> 00:35:06,923
I'm...
I'm technically a stowaway.

550
00:35:07,058 --> 00:35:08,792
Do you know
what they do to stowaways?

551
00:35:08,925 --> 00:35:11,095
Okay, I lied before, okay?

552
00:35:11,228 --> 00:35:13,663
I do have a family,
and she's on the ship.

553
00:35:13,797 --> 00:35:15,099
Her name is...

554
00:35:16,833 --> 00:35:18,135
Hayley Adams.

555
00:35:18,269 --> 00:35:20,171
[laughing]

556
00:35:23,307 --> 00:35:24,542
You idiot.

557
00:35:24,674 --> 00:35:28,279
You knocked up
the admiral's daughter.

558
00:35:28,412 --> 00:35:30,014
Are you suicidal?

559
00:35:30,147 --> 00:35:32,450
- I didn't know who her dad was.
- His face is everywhere!

560
00:35:32,582 --> 00:35:34,318
I'm just trying to do
the right thing here, okay?

561
00:35:34,452 --> 00:35:36,619
- [Stanley] <i>Clay, report.</i>
- [intercom chirps]

562
00:35:36,753 --> 00:35:39,957
- Please, Clay.
- You know the shit you just put me in?

563
00:35:40,091 --> 00:35:41,925
Look, I'm just trying
to do right by them.

564
00:35:42,059 --> 00:35:44,794
<i>Clay, Goddamn it!
Where are you?</i>

565
00:35:44,928 --> 00:35:47,131
If you're gonna
tell him, just...

566
00:35:48,165 --> 00:35:51,168
I don't know, give me
a head start, at least, okay?

567
00:35:52,336 --> 00:35:53,703
Please?

568
00:35:54,871 --> 00:35:56,906
Clay? Clay.

569
00:36:05,282 --> 00:36:07,318
Jesus.

570
00:36:09,253 --> 00:36:10,387
Oh, what is this?

571
00:36:12,456 --> 00:36:13,424
Where's Blue?

572
00:36:13,557 --> 00:36:16,127
It's, um... it's Shady.

573
00:36:16,260 --> 00:36:18,028
What the hell
did you do to him?

574
00:36:18,162 --> 00:36:19,463
Teek found him like this.

575
00:36:19,597 --> 00:36:22,199
Shady is everywhere.

576
00:36:22,333 --> 00:36:24,934
So where the fuck
is Ensign Blucher?

577
00:36:25,069 --> 00:36:26,703
Blue couldn't have done this.

578
00:36:26,836 --> 00:36:28,606
I don't know
what could have done this.

579
00:36:28,771 --> 00:36:30,407
Uh, decompression, maybe,

580
00:36:30,541 --> 00:36:33,210
but, uh, if there
was a leak in the <i>Herc,</i>

581
00:36:33,344 --> 00:36:35,645
- we'd all be dead.
- Ortega's also missing.

582
00:36:35,778 --> 00:36:37,647
No, she's not.

583
00:36:37,780 --> 00:36:39,883
She just went
looking for Blue.

584
00:36:44,255 --> 00:36:46,056
Clay, we're calling up
the footage now,

585
00:36:46,190 --> 00:36:48,325
trying to figure out what happened,
but it might take a minute.

586
00:36:48,459 --> 00:36:50,760
We need to get
all the crew in on the search.

587
00:36:55,665 --> 00:36:57,601
I worked with Blue
for 10 years.

588
00:36:57,734 --> 00:36:59,270
He didn't do this.

589
00:37:01,572 --> 00:37:03,307
[sighs]

590
00:37:04,108 --> 00:37:07,978
Kid, just in case I'm wrong,

591
00:37:08,112 --> 00:37:09,746
Blue's a big boy.

592
00:37:09,879 --> 00:37:11,248
Give him some room.

593
00:37:17,787 --> 00:37:19,056
Mmm.

594
00:37:19,923 --> 00:37:21,824

No.

[Clay on radio] <i>Is the feed

<i>All right.
Well, I found Ortega.</i>

605
00:38:24,854 --> 00:38:26,957
- What'd she say?
- Nothing.

606
00:38:31,996 --> 00:38:34,098
Blue bashed her head in.

What do you think
he wants with the admiral?

611
00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:05,055
Blue, what the fuck
are you doing?

612
00:40:06,190 --> 00:40:07,491
We found Shady and Ortega.

613
00:40:08,325 --> 00:40:09,493
[Clay] Come on, buddy.

614
00:40:09,626 --> 00:40:10,961
You want Stanley
to use his cannon?

615
00:40:11,095 --> 00:40:12,563
Drop the cutter.

616
00:40:14,965 --> 00:40:16,233
Turn around!

00:40:21,372 --> 00:40:24,575
Oh, fuck.
What happened to him?

619
00:40:24,708 --> 00:40:26,876
I'm ordering you
to lay down your weapon.

620
00:40:30,114 --> 00:40:32,182
Put your weapon down,
and surrender.

621
00:40:32,316 --> 00:40:34,651
- [growling]
- It's your final warning.

622
00:40:34,785 --> 00:40:36,086
Lay down your fucking weapon!

623
00:40:36,220 --> 00:40:37,821
I don't think
he's gonna listen.

624
00:40:37,955 --> 00:40:41,525
Goddamn it, Blue.
He's gonna kill you.

Jesus Christ,
how did he do that?

628
00:40:59,109 --> 00:41:00,477
We need to stop the bleeding.

629
00:41:03,447 --> 00:41:05,149
Can't find an artery.

630
00:41:07,950 --> 00:41:09,520
Is he dead?

631
00:41:14,224 --> 00:41:15,959
Is he dead?

632
00:41:16,593 --> 00:41:18,295
Yeah, he's gone.

633
00:41:20,898 --> 00:41:22,132
So is Xu.

00:41:33,143 --> 00:41:34,645
That's not just cabin fever.

636
00:41:34,778 --> 00:41:36,413
He ate Xu's neck.

637
00:41:37,614 --> 00:41:38,582
He ate it.

638
00:41:38,715 --> 00:41:40,484
We need to find out
what happened.

639
00:41:43,287 --> 00:41:46,056
What's taking so long

I'm going as fast as I can.

It's one room, Teek.

642
00:41:51,261 --> 00:41:53,197
Why does he look like that?

643
00:41:53,330 --> 00:41:54,598
Something seems to be

644
00:41:54,731 --> 00:41:56,500
dissolving him
from the inside out.

645
00:42:01,338 --> 00:42:03,740
We have to do an autopsy.
You guys go.

646
00:42:03,874 --> 00:42:05,342
I need to be alone.

647
00:42:29,766 --> 00:42:31,101

So you misplaced some organs?

No. I was alone
with Blue all night.

693
00:46:35,879 --> 00:46:37,581
When I cut him open,
his spleen, his heart,

his nervous system, his blood

695
00:46:39,583 --> 00:46:41,485

been eaten down to nothing.

Eaten? Like "eaten"?

697
00:46:43,820 --> 00:46:45,722
Wait. So if Blue didn't
have anything inside him...

698
00:46:45,856 --> 00:46:47,691
Then how could he still move?

699
00:46:47,824 --> 00:46:50,128
It's 'cause he was being
controlled from the inside.

700
00:46:50,260 --> 00:46:52,262
Let me show you something.

701
00:46:56,433 --> 00:46:58,635
The strand on the left
belongs to Blue,

00:46:58,769 --> 00:47:01,371

not even carbon-based.

It's not human.

00:47:14,185 --> 00:47:16,353
If I'm guessing...

708
00:47:16,486 --> 00:47:18,956
Blue picked up some sort
of virus or a parasite.

709
00:47:19,090 --> 00:47:22,526
Invades the body of the host and
then wears it like a cheap suit.

710
00:47:22,659 --> 00:47:23,760
So how did it get onboard?

711
00:47:23,894 --> 00:47:25,395
I had the ship
do a head count

712
00:47:25,529 --> 00:47:26,797
after you found Ortega,
just to make sure

713
00:47:26,930 --> 00:47:28,799
that nobody else
had gone missing,

714
00:47:28,932 --> 00:47:30,567

00:47:40,644 --> 00:47:41,845
Wait, wait, wait.
I can explain...

720
00:47:41,979 --> 00:47:43,513
- I can explain.
- Hey, hey! Oh, whoa, whoa.

721
00:47:43,647 --> 00:47:45,682
- What was the fucking plan?
- No! I don't know!

722
00:47:45,816 --> 00:47:47,884
Infect the crew?
Then eat our guts

723
00:47:48,019 --> 00:47:49,053
while you sink the ship?

724
00:47:49,187 --> 00:47:50,188
No! Fucking no!

725
00:47:50,320 --> 00:47:51,255
He's not trying to kill us.

726
00:47:51,388 --> 00:47:52,489
He's just a scared kid

727
00:47:52,622 --> 00:47:54,424
trying to survive,
like the rest of us.

728
00:47:56,893 --> 00:47:58,328
Any more secrets?

729
00:48:01,698 --> 00:48:02,967
- [yells]
- [grunts]

730
00:48:04,969 --> 00:48:06,603
[coughs]

731
00:48:06,736 --> 00:48:09,140
So if this asshole
didn't let it in,

732
00:48:09,273 --> 00:48:13,110
we need to find out who did
and what we're dealing with.

733
00:48:13,944 --> 00:48:15,512
Show them.

734
00:48:16,147 --> 00:48:17,881
They deserve to know.

735
00:48:30,360 --> 00:48:32,362
Holy shit.

736
00:48:39,736 --> 00:48:41,705
[sighs] And look.

737
00:48:43,740 --> 00:48:44,976
They're not alone.

738
00:48:46,077 --> 00:48:48,478
So when you said parasite,
you meant...

739
00:48:48,612 --> 00:48:51,048
Alien. And it might
still be out there.

740
00:48:51,948 --> 00:48:55,019
If it's out there,
we kill it.

741
00:48:55,152 --> 00:48:56,220
[Teek] What is it?

742
00:48:57,154 --> 00:48:59,123
- I don't know.
- Where did it come from?

743
00:48:59,257 --> 00:49:00,857
Again, I don't know.

744
00:49:00,992 --> 00:49:03,727
So how does a thing like that
sneak onboard without us knowing?

745
00:49:03,860 --> 00:49:06,130
Because somebody
had to bring it onboard.

746
00:49:08,732 --> 00:49:10,834
Do we know who did it?

747
00:49:12,569 --> 00:49:14,205
What are you doing?

748
00:49:14,338 --> 00:49:16,573
We have to wake up
the admiral.

749
00:49:16,706 --> 00:49:18,608
- No, we don't.
- Something is on this ship

750
00:49:18,742 --> 00:49:21,778
killing his men.
This is his responsibility.

751
00:49:21,912 --> 00:49:23,580
Well, the paranoid bastard

752
00:49:23,713 --> 00:49:26,217
made sure we couldn't
break into his quarters,

753
00:49:26,350 --> 00:49:28,052
let alone wake him from Cryo.

754
00:49:28,185 --> 00:49:29,486
And I don't trust
the stowaway,

755
00:49:29,619 --> 00:49:32,589
so he goes out the air lock.

756
00:49:33,357 --> 00:49:34,758
Stanley, let him go!

757
00:49:35,960 --> 00:49:37,028
Guys.

758
00:49:39,297 --> 00:49:40,530
Guys!

759
00:49:46,103 --> 00:49:48,005

777
00:50:50,867 --> 00:50:51,901
Get to the arsenal.

778
00:50:52,036 --> 00:50:53,670
Hey, the crew
are still locked in.

779
00:50:53,803 --> 00:50:55,572
[computer] <i>Cabin doors opening.</i>

780
00:50:55,705 --> 00:50:57,308
What's happening?

781
00:50:57,441 --> 00:50:58,742
Someone's letting them out.

782
00:50:58,875 --> 00:51:00,643
That's impossible.
Only Stanley can do that,

783
00:51:00,777 --> 00:51:01,945
and he's dead.

784
00:51:02,079 --> 00:51:03,014
[door clunks]

785
00:51:03,147 --> 00:51:04,848
Not anymore.

787
00:51:22,832 --> 00:51:24,235
Move! Move!

788
00:51:26,037 --> 00:51:28,671
- Did you find Blue yet?
- Run, you fucking idiots!

789
00:51:28,805 --> 00:51:30,041
Get inside! Lock the doors!

790

[snarling]

791
00:51:40,617 --> 00:51:42,086
What the fuck?

792
00:51:48,292 --> 00:51:49,326
- Go.
- What is it?

793
00:51:49,460 --> 00:51:50,593
I already told you I don't know.

794
00:51:50,727 --> 00:51:52,229
Blue, Ortega, and Xu
were all dead,

795
00:51:52,363 --> 00:51:54,697
so how the fuck is it
still able to control them?

796
00:51:54,831 --> 00:51:56,434
- I didn't bring it on the ship.
- Think! Try anything!

797
00:51:56,566 --> 00:51:58,768
- I said I don't know!
- Everybody knock it off!

798
00:51:58,902 --> 00:52:00,371
He doesn't know anything!

799
00:52:00,504 --> 00:52:02,239
Look, I didn't
fight my way onto the ship

800
00:52:02,373 --> 00:52:04,275
so I could kill anyone.

801
00:52:04,408 --> 00:52:06,177
I'm here so I could
protect my family.

802
00:52:06,310 --> 00:52:08,546
We won't have long
before they find us.

803
00:52:08,678 --> 00:52:10,713
Okay. Then what are we
supposed to do?

804
00:52:10,847 --> 00:52:12,749
- We need to get to security.
- What, and send a message?

805
00:52:12,882 --> 00:52:13,984
There's no signal
with JAG command

806
00:52:14,118 --> 00:52:15,519
until we're closer to New Earth.

807
00:52:15,652 --> 00:52:17,188
All right, Doc,
how do we kill it?

808
00:52:17,321 --> 00:52:19,223
I don't know.
Bullets only slowed them down.

809
00:52:19,356 --> 00:52:20,690
Brute force didn't work.

810
00:52:20,824 --> 00:52:22,293
What about fire?

811
00:52:23,360 --> 00:52:25,862
- Might work.
- Good enough for me.

812
00:52:25,996 --> 00:52:27,630
You remember how to use
one of those things?

813
00:52:27,764 --> 00:52:29,133
What do you think?

814
00:52:29,266 --> 00:52:30,434
Where are you going?

815
00:52:30,568 --> 00:52:32,103
- To get Hayley!
- Noah, stop!

816
00:52:32,236 --> 00:52:34,105
- Listen.

819
00:52:39,876 --> 00:52:41,245
Get away from the door.

- They're all dead.
- [snarling]

Don't let 'em
trap us below-deck.

825
00:52:59,597 --> 00:53:01,298
We need to get
to the security bay.

832
00:53:16,547 --> 00:53:17,847
Stand back.

[Teek] Okay, it looks
like they're gone.

837
00:53:43,374 --> 00:53:44,874
We're sitting ducks in here.
We gotta move.

838
00:53:45,009 --> 00:53:46,243
Let's get to the security bay.

Hey, guys,
can somebody tell me

852
00:54:58,215 --> 00:54:59,882
what the fuck is going on?

I can't see him.

856
00:55:06,957 --> 00:55:08,259
Cover me.

857
00:55:09,693 --> 00:55:11,428
[Noah] Wait!

858
00:55:11,562 --> 00:55:13,464
- Should we go after him?
- No. No, they're gone.

859
00:55:13,597 --> 00:55:14,531

- Just wait! Clay!
- Clay?

863

If you can hear us...

864
00:55:22,306 --> 00:55:23,440

[Teek groans]

868
00:55:34,851 --> 00:55:37,054
- We gotta get off the ship.
- Escape pods are over there.

869
00:55:37,187 --> 00:55:39,156
Where are we gonna go?
We're nowhere near New Earth.

870
00:55:39,290 --> 00:55:40,890
All right, let's go
to the, uh, security bay.

871
00:55:41,025 --> 00:55:42,426
- Okay. Okay, this way.
- Come on. Let's go.

872
00:55:42,559 --> 00:55:43,761
Follow me. Follow me.

873
00:55:43,893 --> 00:55:46,130
I'm outta here.
You coming, kid?

Got it.

We gotta patch him up.

00:57:27,131 --> 00:57:28,931
We're all gonna die.

900
00:57:33,404 --> 00:57:34,838
Bullets won't work...

901
00:57:34,972 --> 00:57:36,206
fire...

902
00:57:37,608 --> 00:57:39,109
Can't be killed.

903
00:57:40,711 --> 00:57:41,979
It's death.

904
00:57:43,213 --> 00:57:45,816
- [pounding continues]
- [howling]

905
00:57:45,948 --> 00:57:47,251
Hey, guys...

906
00:57:49,019 --> 00:57:50,220
come up with a plan?

907
00:57:50,354 --> 00:57:52,289
I-I can't tell you
how to kill it

908
00:57:52,423 --> 00:57:54,291
if I don't know what it is.

909
00:57:55,459 --> 00:57:57,594
[snarling]

910
00:57:57,728 --> 00:58:01,999
If someone brought it,
they had to have a reason.

911
00:58:03,434 --> 00:58:06,036
[sighs]

912
00:58:06,170 --> 00:58:07,438
Well, we had a good run.

913
00:58:08,272 --> 00:58:09,973
Not bad for
a bunch of drunks.

914
00:58:10,107 --> 00:58:12,643
So we're supposed to sit here and
wait for them to tear us apart?

915
00:58:12,776 --> 00:58:13,844
No. We're gonna get drunk

916
00:58:13,977 --> 00:58:15,612
and wait for them
to tear us apart.

917
00:58:15,746 --> 00:58:17,681
- You think this is funny?
- You hear anyone laughing?

918
00:58:17,815 --> 00:58:19,650
We are outmatched, outgunned,

919
00:58:19,783 --> 00:58:22,319
and we need reinforcements.

920
00:58:22,453 --> 00:58:24,655
Aren't you supposed to be
some sort of fucking badass?

921
00:58:26,457 --> 00:58:27,825
You just looking out
for yourself?

922
00:58:27,958 --> 00:58:30,461
Yeah, so were you
when you snuck on the ship.

923
00:58:31,428 --> 00:58:33,664
No, I'm looking out
for my family.

924
00:58:33,797 --> 00:58:35,566
[snarling]

925
00:58:35,699 --> 00:58:37,301
Who are you looking out for?

926
00:58:38,569 --> 00:58:40,737
[pounding]

927
00:58:46,076 --> 00:58:47,578
Wait. Where does that go?

928
00:58:49,112 --> 00:58:50,614
The vent, where does it go?

929
00:58:50,747 --> 00:58:52,216
Vents go a lot of places.

930
00:58:52,349 --> 00:58:54,117
- Does it reach the admiral?
- Oh, shit.

931
00:58:54,251 --> 00:58:56,153
All right, damn you.

932
00:58:57,054 --> 00:58:58,957
Have it your way.
For the record,

933
00:58:59,089 --> 00:59:00,357
this is a terrible idea.

934
00:59:00,491 --> 00:59:01,859
But I'll give you a shot.

935
00:59:01,992 --> 00:59:04,695
You wake the admiral.
He blows 'em all up.

936
00:59:04,828 --> 00:59:05,996
You get your girl.

937
00:59:06,129 --> 00:59:07,931
Yeah. Easy.

938
00:59:08,065 --> 00:59:09,566
It's gonna be tight.

939
00:59:09,700 --> 00:59:13,303
Just keep moving,
and do exactly what I say.

940
00:59:13,437 --> 00:59:15,506
Aw, what are you
waiting for?

941
00:59:17,875 --> 00:59:19,576
Up and at 'em, hero.

942
00:59:21,111 --> 00:59:23,313
[grate clatters]

943
00:59:30,120 --> 00:59:33,223
- [snarling]
- [roars]

944
00:59:42,399 --> 00:59:44,101
[Noah] Which way do I go?

945
00:59:44,234 --> 00:59:45,536
Clay, can you hear me?

946
00:59:46,904 --> 00:59:48,438
Please stop doing that.

947
00:59:48,572 --> 00:59:50,140
First turn's coming up.

948
00:59:50,274 --> 00:59:53,110
After that, go 200 feet.

949
00:59:55,078 --> 00:59:57,080
Take your next two lefts.

950
00:59:57,214 --> 00:59:58,849
You wanna hurry it up, son?

951
00:59:58,983 --> 01:00:00,384
[hissing]

952
01:00:01,118 --> 01:00:02,085
Taking first left.

953
01:00:02,219 --> 01:00:03,453
- Now where?
- Stop.

954
01:00:04,221 --> 01:00:05,489
- They're coming.
- What?

955
01:00:05,622 --> 01:00:08,191
They're all
around you. Move.

956
01:00:11,929 --> 01:00:13,397
Taking second left. Now what?

957
01:00:13,530 --> 01:00:15,699
Clay, what's happening?

958
01:00:15,832 --> 01:00:18,335
[Clay laughing]

959
01:00:18,468 --> 01:00:20,370
Hope they eat you first.

960
01:00:23,340 --> 01:00:25,242
[snarling]

961
01:00:25,375 --> 01:00:27,477
[thumping in vent]

962
01:00:40,190 --> 01:00:41,491
I'm sorry.

963
01:00:42,359 --> 01:00:44,728
[shrieking]

964
01:00:49,499 --> 01:00:51,401
God, please forgive me.

965
01:00:51,535 --> 01:00:54,271
Don't start praying yet, Teek.

966
01:00:55,138 --> 01:00:56,807
Kid might be onto something.

967
01:01:07,451 --> 01:01:09,486
[whispering] Clay.

968
01:01:09,620 --> 01:01:11,688
- Clay?
- I'll tell you when to stop.

969
01:01:11,822 --> 01:01:13,091
Listen to me.

970
01:01:13,223 --> 01:01:15,692
Xu and Ortega, they're here.

971
01:01:15,826 --> 01:01:18,428
[growling]

972
01:01:19,796 --> 01:01:22,132
They didn't see you.
Keep moving.

973
01:01:30,340 --> 01:01:32,209
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

974
01:01:32,342 --> 01:01:33,710
[snarling]

975
01:01:34,979 --> 01:01:37,015
Almost there, kid.

976
01:01:37,147 --> 01:01:38,682
Keep going.

977
01:01:38,815 --> 01:01:41,184
I have to tell you
something. I...

978
01:01:46,323 --> 01:01:48,158
I did it. It was me.

979
01:01:51,828 --> 01:01:52,796
Teek.

980
01:01:52,929 --> 01:01:54,098
What did you do?

981
01:01:54,231 --> 01:01:55,198
Tell us.

982
01:01:55,332 --> 01:01:57,969
I-I thought it would be quick.

983
01:01:58,102 --> 01:01:59,803
I-I thought it would...

984
01:01:59,936 --> 01:02:01,505
I thought it would
kill us fast.

985
01:02:01,638 --> 01:02:02,739
Teek...

986
01:02:03,540 --> 01:02:04,608
tell me what you did.

987
01:02:04,741 --> 01:02:06,309
- Teek.
- [Clay] You're lying.

988
01:02:06,443 --> 01:02:08,512
- You didn't do it.
- It was me!

989
01:02:10,247 --> 01:02:12,215
- [snarls]
- They found me.

990
01:02:12,349 --> 01:02:15,252
- Run!
- [snarling]

991
01:02:16,154 --> 01:02:18,889
[grunting]

992
01:02:22,259 --> 01:02:24,294
Left or right?
Left or right?

993
01:02:24,428 --> 01:02:25,762
Take a right.

994
01:02:27,330 --> 01:02:28,799
[yells]

995
01:02:29,933 --> 01:02:33,670
We're gonna die
because of you.

996
01:02:33,804 --> 01:02:34,938
[grunts]

997
01:02:41,344 --> 01:02:42,679
Get up!

998
01:02:43,580 --> 01:02:44,915
[Noah] <i>Clay, what's going on?</i>

999
01:02:45,049 --> 01:02:46,650
I'll deal with you later.

1000
01:02:47,718 --> 01:02:49,087
<i>Think I'm lost.</i>

1001
01:02:49,619 --> 01:02:52,023
Where's Xu and Ortega?

1002
01:02:52,156 --> 01:02:54,925
[growling]

1003
01:02:55,960 --> 01:02:57,260
[roars]

1004
01:02:58,029 --> 01:02:59,362
[roars]

1005
01:02:59,496 --> 01:03:01,331
Which way do I go?

1006
01:03:01,465 --> 01:03:03,333
There should be a vent
to your right.

1007
01:03:28,391 --> 01:03:29,793
What's the holdup?

1008
01:03:46,710 --> 01:03:47,444
[grunts]

1009
01:03:47,577 --> 01:03:49,713
[alarm blaring]

1010
01:03:57,221 --> 01:03:59,890
[scoffs] You again.

1011
01:04:08,532 --> 01:04:10,500
[Chambers] <i>Why would you
want to hurt us?</i>

1012
01:04:12,369 --> 01:04:15,372
Everything's not about "us."

1013
01:04:15,505 --> 01:04:18,341
There are 300,000 souls
on this ship,

1014
01:04:18,475 --> 01:04:20,911
<i>good people just trying
to make a fresh start</i>

1015
01:04:21,045 --> 01:04:22,445
<i>on a better planet.</i>

1016
01:04:22,579 --> 01:04:24,048
Isn't that what you maniacs
preach about?

1017
01:04:24,182 --> 01:04:25,283
What about them?

1018
01:04:25,415 --> 01:04:27,018
Maybe mankind
had its chance.

1019
01:04:27,151 --> 01:04:30,654
See, we can't keep destroying
everything that we touch.

1020
01:04:31,521 --> 01:04:33,356
There's a lot of us who get it.

1021
01:04:33,490 --> 01:04:36,793
We see humanity
for the parasite that it is.

1022
01:04:38,229 --> 01:04:39,329
Shame on you.

1023
01:04:39,462 --> 01:04:40,998
We get what we deserve.

1024
01:04:41,132 --> 01:04:42,699
What is it?

1025
01:04:43,533 --> 01:04:44,935
You brought it here.

1026
01:04:45,069 --> 01:04:46,703
You don't know?

1027
01:04:47,704 --> 01:04:48,973
Where'd it come from?

1028
01:04:49,106 --> 01:04:52,375
<i>Did you find it?
You cook it up in a lab?</i>

1029
01:04:52,509 --> 01:04:55,912
Did it fall from the sky?
Where is it from?

1030
01:04:56,047 --> 01:04:57,380
The experiments.

1031
01:04:57,514 --> 01:04:59,016
So they made it.

1032
01:04:59,150 --> 01:05:01,319
No, we didn't make it.

1033
01:05:01,451 --> 01:05:02,485
We brought it back.

1034
01:05:02,619 --> 01:05:04,487
You brought it back
from where?

1035
01:05:04,621 --> 01:05:08,658
Another planet?
Another universe?

1036
01:05:09,793 --> 01:05:12,596
Maybe it was here
from before the universe.

1037
01:05:12,729 --> 01:05:15,432
And it's gonna kill us all,
even you,

1038
01:05:15,565 --> 01:05:17,969
because you told it to.

1039
01:05:18,102 --> 01:05:19,170
No.

1040
01:05:19,303 --> 01:05:21,005
Because it wants to.

1041
01:05:21,938 --> 01:05:24,075
Because that's all it knows.

1042
01:05:24,208 --> 01:05:26,344
[squealing]

1043
01:05:26,476 --> 01:05:29,046
[Adams] <i>All right, all right,
I heard enough of this monster.</i>

1044
01:05:29,180 --> 01:05:32,016
Are you sober enough to return
to active service, Captain?

1045
01:05:32,149 --> 01:05:33,583
Just like the old days.

1046
01:05:33,717 --> 01:05:34,784
Anything else I should know?

1047
01:05:34,918 --> 01:05:36,419
[Chambers] <i>It's getting smarter.</i>

1048
01:05:36,553 --> 01:05:38,388
We've already found it
targeting the reactor

1049
01:05:38,521 --> 01:05:39,756
and your bunker, sir.

1050
01:05:39,890 --> 01:05:41,993
And where is this horde now?

1051
01:05:43,693 --> 01:05:46,063
[shrieking]

1052
01:05:46,197 --> 01:05:47,231
All right.

1053
01:05:47,365 --> 01:05:48,665
[clears throat]

1054
01:05:48,798 --> 01:05:50,634
There's no need
to complicate things.

1055
01:05:51,668 --> 01:05:53,170
Let's kill 'em all,

1056
01:05:53,304 --> 01:05:55,206
flush 'em out the air-vac.
How's that sound?

1057
01:05:55,339 --> 01:05:57,108
Works for me, sir.

1058
01:05:58,109 --> 01:06:00,044
Ah, look here.

1059
01:06:01,845 --> 01:06:05,415
Wake 'em up. Strap up. Move out.

1060
01:06:14,925 --> 01:06:19,263
We, uh, graduated
from the same academy.

1061
01:06:19,397 --> 01:06:22,632
Majored in orbital warfare.

1062
01:06:22,766 --> 01:06:24,969
- Clay?
- Once upon a time...

1063
01:06:26,170 --> 01:06:27,837
he was a warrior.

1064
01:06:27,972 --> 01:06:31,175
He disobeyed orders
during the Eos uprising.

1065
01:06:31,309 --> 01:06:34,979
He refused to fire on
protestors during the riots.

1066
01:06:35,112 --> 01:06:38,115
He got blue falconed
back to rear detachment.

1067
01:06:38,249 --> 01:06:40,117
Wait a second.

1068
01:06:40,251 --> 01:06:42,919
Hey, what's the status
on Cryo?

1069
01:06:43,054 --> 01:06:45,189
Don't worry. She's fine.

1070
01:06:45,323 --> 01:06:47,124
Who's fine?

1071
01:06:47,258 --> 01:06:49,060
Hayley.

1072
01:06:50,261 --> 01:06:51,628
You...

1073
01:06:52,929 --> 01:06:54,597
you're the father.

1074
01:06:54,731 --> 01:06:56,233
[Clay] Whoa, sir.

1075
01:06:56,367 --> 01:06:58,868
He's an idiot,
but he's our idiot.

1076
01:07:01,105 --> 01:07:02,772
We might need him.

1077
01:07:03,840 --> 01:07:05,809
I'll deal with you later.

1078
01:07:06,676 --> 01:07:07,944
Commander!

1079
01:07:09,013 --> 01:07:11,415
Orbital 1701,
ready to maim, murder,

1080
01:07:11,548 --> 01:07:13,017
and kill on your command, sir.

1081
01:07:13,850 --> 01:07:15,252
We are here to hunt.

1082
01:07:15,386 --> 01:07:16,753
We are here to kill.

1083
01:07:16,886 --> 01:07:18,755
We are here to survive.

1084
01:07:18,888 --> 01:07:20,690
Lead the way, son.

1087
01:07:31,668 --> 01:07:33,337
How much time do we have?

1088
01:07:33,471 --> 01:07:36,706
About two seconds longer
than him.

1090
01:08:09,173 --> 01:08:10,241
Here goes nothing.

1091
01:08:17,281 --> 01:08:18,548
Watch your six.

1092
01:08:19,417 --> 01:08:20,817

1098
01:09:15,239 --> 01:09:16,673

Little closer. Come on.

1128
01:12:00,304 --> 01:12:03,940

I think she'll be all right.

That crazy motherfucker.

1138
01:12:50,621 --> 01:12:52,855
So I guess it's over now.

01:12:54,857 --> 01:12:56,293
Hey! Where you going?

1140
01:12:56,427 --> 01:12:58,962
- Get Hayley!
- Who's gonna mop this up?

fucking kidding me.

What is this thing?

1144
01:13:20,117 --> 01:13:21,918
We have to get out of here.

1145
01:13:23,153 --> 01:13:25,589
Come on! Let's go!

1146
01:13:31,995 --> 01:13:33,197
[Chambers] Where are we going?

1147
01:13:33,330 --> 01:13:34,798
To get Hayley
and get off the ship.

1148
01:13:34,931 --> 01:13:38,935
Go where? We're a billion
miles from everywhere.

1149
01:13:39,069 --> 01:13:41,338
- [deep growling]
- What was that?

1150
01:13:43,140 --> 01:13:44,441
Something new.

1151
01:13:46,610 --> 01:13:47,877
Moxacell.

1152
01:13:48,011 --> 01:13:49,213
Moxacell?

1153
01:13:49,346 --> 01:13:50,848
I used it on Blue,
and it worked.

1154
01:13:50,981 --> 01:13:52,483
And you're
just now telling us?

1155
01:13:52,616 --> 01:13:53,883
You sure he was dead?

1156
01:13:54,017 --> 01:13:55,252
This thing
has tricked us before.

1157
01:13:55,386 --> 01:13:57,154
I watched him
melt away to nothing.

That way.

01:14:03,727 --> 01:14:05,295
Where's the moonshine?

Yeah, but this, this'll
melt them to jelly. Trust me.

1193
01:15:58,675 --> 01:16:00,210
It tried for the reactor
with Blue.

1194
01:16:00,344 --> 01:16:01,912
When that failed,
it went for the admiral,

1195
01:16:02,045 --> 01:16:03,680
the only person on this ship
with access to the reactor,

1196
01:16:03,814 --> 01:16:05,516
and when we stopped it,
it came for us,

1197
01:16:05,649 --> 01:16:08,352
because it knew we would find
some way to wake him up.

1198

- What?
- No.

1204
01:16:24,568 --> 01:16:26,069
And there's no aliens
trying to eat us?

1205
01:16:26,203 --> 01:16:28,272
- They've left us alone?
- What the fuck?

1206
01:16:28,405 --> 01:16:30,207

can kill an entire planet?

You're talking
about 50 million people.

We won't be able to get through.

to the escape pod.

- Come on. Just trust me.
- What?

We have to go.
