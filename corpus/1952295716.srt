1
00:01:08,068 --> 00:01:09,695
Hey, Ringo, it's time.

2
00:01:12,205 --> 00:01:14,196
Two min-- he's coming.

3
00:01:14,241 --> 00:01:17,210
Freddy's ready, man.
Come on.

4
00:01:17,244 --> 00:01:19,337
Give me a minute.

5
00:01:48,508 --> 00:01:50,476
All right.

6
00:01:50,510 --> 00:01:53,070
- Gonna win some of that tonight, man.
- Sounds good to me.

7
00:01:53,113 --> 00:01:55,513
I know it ain't The Garden,
but we've got a packed house.

8
00:01:55,548 --> 00:01:57,516
- He's ready, right?
- I'm ready.

9
00:01:57,550 --> 00:01:59,381
Who's up, The Brother?

10
00:01:59,419 --> 00:02:01,546
No, it's The Brother's
brother-- The Brute, Luca.

11
00:02:01,588 --> 00:02:05,524
- Just give us a good show, man.
- Hey, I only know one way to fight.

12
00:02:05,558 --> 00:02:08,152
Yeah, that's why you're still
in this piece-of-shit rathole.

13
00:02:08,194 --> 00:02:11,163
- Let's go.
- Come on.

14
00:02:19,606 --> 00:02:21,471
All right, this is your fight,
Ringo, okay?

15
00:02:21,508 --> 00:02:22,668
This is all you, big guy.

16
00:02:22,709 --> 00:02:25,371
You win this, we get 500, all right?

17
00:02:36,656 --> 00:02:39,318
- How's the left arm? It's good?
- Good good.

18
00:02:45,065 --> 00:02:47,295
- You got this--
- Fuck off.

19
00:02:49,836 --> 00:02:52,202
Yeah, let's go, baby!

20
00:02:52,238 --> 00:02:54,763
You the man, Luca.
You the man. Do it!

21
00:02:58,478 --> 00:03:01,072
Don't worry about this guy, all right?

22
00:03:05,251 --> 00:03:06,775
Second fighters out.

23
00:03:08,955 --> 00:03:11,822
Bring it in.
I want a good clean fight.

24
00:03:11,858 --> 00:03:13,621
All right, let's fight!

25
00:03:17,464 --> 00:03:18,488
Come on, Ringo.

26
00:03:31,611 --> 00:03:34,512
That's art you're watching, all right?
That's art.

27
00:03:34,547 --> 00:03:36,640
Look at this guy.
He's dancing, okay?

28
00:03:36,683 --> 00:03:39,743
That's like-- that's like dancing.

29
00:03:39,786 --> 00:03:41,754
- Boo!
- Come on, you gonna fight or what?

30
00:03:41,788 --> 00:03:43,813
- That's what I'm doing.
- That's not fighting!

31
00:03:43,857 --> 00:03:46,792
Come on, beat the shit out of each other
before this crowd kills us.

32
00:03:58,071 --> 00:04:00,835
- Yeah!
- Come on, get him!

33
00:04:00,874 --> 00:04:02,466
Yeah!

34
00:04:05,979 --> 00:04:07,446
Yeah!

35
00:04:26,299 --> 00:04:28,927
- What's wrong?
- He got a--

36
00:04:28,968 --> 00:04:32,301
Come on!

37
00:04:32,338 --> 00:04:35,364
Yeah!

38
00:04:35,408 --> 00:04:37,376
Come on!

39
00:04:41,047 --> 00:04:43,072
Fuck.

40
00:04:43,116 --> 00:04:45,050
Come on!

41
00:04:45,085 --> 00:04:48,145
Now when you step into that cage,

42
00:04:48,188 --> 00:04:52,818
the first rule of fighting
is don't get hit.

43
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:03,628
If you break that rule,
then there's another one

44
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:06,195
which is you're gonna hurt
no matter what.

45
00:05:06,239 --> 00:05:09,402
Gonna hurt like hell.

46
00:05:09,442 --> 00:05:11,740
Gonna hurt like hell.

47
00:05:11,778 --> 00:05:13,905
Gonna hurt like hell.

48
00:05:17,083 --> 00:05:19,551
Now when you step into that cage,

49
00:05:19,586 --> 00:05:21,816
the first rule of fighting

50
00:05:21,855 --> 00:05:24,722
is don't get hit.

51
00:05:24,757 --> 00:05:26,816
Now I told you,

52
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:29,761
don't-- don't-- don't get hit.

53
00:05:29,796 --> 00:05:33,027
You're gonna get hurt.

54
00:05:33,066 --> 00:05:35,500
The king in his cage.

55
00:05:35,535 --> 00:05:37,628
Get out of there alive.

56
00:06:10,236 --> 00:06:12,966
Now when you step into that cage,

57
00:06:13,006 --> 00:06:16,032
it's gonna hurt like hell.

58
00:06:16,075 --> 00:06:18,873
Don't get hit.
It's gonna hurt like hell.

59
00:06:21,047 --> 00:06:23,641
If you break that rule,

60
00:06:23,683 --> 00:06:26,208
it's gonna hurt like hell.

61
00:06:26,252 --> 00:06:30,279
Live to win.
It's gonna hurt like hell.

62
00:07:14,434 --> 00:07:15,901
Ringo?

63
00:07:19,038 --> 00:07:21,063
Yeah.

64
00:07:21,107 --> 00:07:23,735
You okay?

65
00:07:23,776 --> 00:07:26,643
Yeah.

66
00:07:26,679 --> 00:07:29,079
I'm great.

67
00:07:29,115 --> 00:07:31,106
I'll be out in a sec.

68
00:09:10,483 --> 00:09:13,281
I didn't see it.
Big Freddy didn't see it.

69
00:09:13,319 --> 00:09:15,310
Luca's an asshole and a cheat.

70
00:09:15,355 --> 00:09:17,050
I don't know which one's worse.

71
00:09:17,090 --> 00:09:19,718
That's okay, Link.
You win some, you lose most.

72
00:09:19,759 --> 00:09:22,728
100 bucks is 100 bucks.
Here's your cut.

73
00:09:23,930 --> 00:09:27,195
Really? Thanks, Ringo.

74
00:09:49,722 --> 00:09:51,690
It's this one, right?

75
00:09:51,724 --> 00:09:53,624
- Yes.
- Ringo.

76
00:09:53,659 --> 00:09:57,459
- Hey, Pepper.
- Who's my favorite?

77
00:09:57,497 --> 00:09:59,089
How you doing?
You're looking great.

78
00:09:59,132 --> 00:10:01,862
- Hey, Link.
- Hi, Pepper.

79
00:10:01,901 --> 00:10:04,802
Hey, do you think you could
help me do this up?

80
00:10:04,837 --> 00:10:07,271
Is anybody gonna help
with the goddamn beer?

81
00:10:07,306 --> 00:10:09,297
Let me help you with that, Kara.

82
00:10:11,277 --> 00:10:13,245
What the hell happened to your face?

83
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:15,213
Nothing. Face is fine.

84
00:10:15,248 --> 00:10:17,239
That kid's not supposed
to be back here.

85
00:10:17,283 --> 00:10:19,012
Oh, he's a darling.

86
00:10:19,051 --> 00:10:21,042
And you're late.

87
00:10:22,622 --> 00:10:24,283
I gotta go.

88
00:10:24,323 --> 00:10:26,314
Ringo needs me and I help him so...

89
00:10:26,359 --> 00:10:28,384
Okay.

90
00:10:28,428 --> 00:10:31,090
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

91
00:10:35,535 --> 00:10:37,935
- I'm gonna go.
- Okay. Bye, Link.

92
00:10:40,773 --> 00:10:45,107
Oh my God, she's so cute
and naked all the time.

93
00:10:45,144 --> 00:10:47,669
- She's just so naked.
- You know you don't work here, right?

94
00:10:47,713 --> 00:10:49,908
I got it.
I'll just hang out with you.

95
00:10:49,949 --> 00:10:52,941
No. Go home.

96
00:10:52,985 --> 00:10:55,579
Yeah, I mean I should go.
Good fight tonight, Ringo.

97
00:10:55,621 --> 00:10:57,714
That was a good fight?

98
00:10:57,757 --> 00:11:00,988
- You're still walking.
- You're right.

99
00:11:46,906 --> 00:11:50,103
- Jesus Christ, you're a mess, Ringo.
- Yeah, ain't that the truth?

100
00:11:50,142 --> 00:11:53,009
All right, we're slammed.
Let's go.

101
00:12:34,754 --> 00:12:37,416
You better slow down or else
you're gonna get those guys drunk.

102
00:12:37,456 --> 00:12:39,720
Stop trying to be charming
and get me my ice, Duran.

103
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:41,727
Hey, I stopped being
charming for weeks now.

104
00:12:41,761 --> 00:12:43,422
It wasn't doing me any good.

105
00:12:45,998 --> 00:12:49,434
You know, soon enough
I'm gonna start thinking

106
00:12:49,468 --> 00:12:51,095
you're not interested.

107
00:12:51,137 --> 00:12:52,627
I'm not.

108
00:12:56,008 --> 00:12:58,238
So you never told me
what happened to your face.

109
00:12:58,277 --> 00:13:00,142
Well, the guy went left,
I went right.

110
00:13:00,179 --> 00:13:02,875
- You know how it goes.
- What happened when you went right?

111
00:13:02,915 --> 00:13:06,851
I blocked his punch with my face.

112
00:13:10,623 --> 00:13:14,150
What are you doing when you're
not fighting or getting me ice anyway?

113
00:13:14,193 --> 00:13:16,753
- Sleep.
- Yeah? Alone?

114
00:13:16,796 --> 00:13:19,959
Kara, you know, can I take five?

115
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:21,967
Yeah, sure.

116
00:13:22,001 --> 00:13:23,969
Just bring me back
a couple boxes of ice.

117
00:13:24,003 --> 00:13:26,130
Sure, no problem.

118
00:13:28,441 --> 00:13:31,933
- Yo, give me a beer.
- Not you again.

119
00:13:48,194 --> 00:13:51,095
- Hey, I made 20 bucks tonight.
- Link.

120
00:13:55,701 --> 00:13:58,864
Ringo, where you going?

121
00:13:58,904 --> 00:14:01,805
Hey, Mr. Ponzo,
I didn't see you come in.

122
00:14:03,142 --> 00:14:04,905
Well, I saw you.

123
00:14:04,944 --> 00:14:06,673
I saw you sneaking away
like a little dog.

124
00:14:06,712 --> 00:14:08,179
What, all you guys are alike?

125
00:14:08,214 --> 00:14:11,274
Look, Sergio, why don't
you go to the VIP?

126
00:14:11,317 --> 00:14:13,182
I'll send you a bottle
and we can talk things--

127
00:14:13,219 --> 00:14:14,811
I didn't come here to talk.

128
00:14:14,854 --> 00:14:17,379
I didn't come to look at the girls.
You know why I'm here.

129
00:14:17,423 --> 00:14:20,586
It's time for you
to give me back my money.

130
00:14:24,430 --> 00:14:26,728
Relax.

131
00:14:28,801 --> 00:14:30,792
All right.

132
00:14:37,109 --> 00:14:40,010
- What the fuck is this?
- It's all I got.

133
00:14:40,046 --> 00:14:42,276
Are you kidding me?
It's all you got?

134
00:14:42,314 --> 00:14:46,114
There's a huge disparity between
all you got and what you owe.

135
00:14:46,152 --> 00:14:48,882
- That's the story of my life.
- You don't get it, do you?

136
00:14:48,921 --> 00:14:52,084
This is an insult.
You owe me--

137
00:14:52,124 --> 00:14:54,149
Razer.

138
00:14:58,731 --> 00:15:01,666
Ringo, I got a business
to run, all right?

139
00:15:01,701 --> 00:15:03,498
I got a reputation to uphold

140
00:15:03,536 --> 00:15:05,902
and if I allow one person
to be one day late,

141
00:15:05,938 --> 00:15:08,304
my whole system could fail.

142
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:11,867
Now you owe me $20,000

143
00:15:11,911 --> 00:15:14,402
and I want it now.

144
00:15:20,453 --> 00:15:23,081
Six years of self-defense
and three bad boyfriends.

145
00:15:23,122 --> 00:15:25,022
Try me, asshole.

146
00:15:25,057 --> 00:15:27,787
Ringo, the girls here
fight better than you.

147
00:15:27,827 --> 00:15:30,091
Yeah, you don't need to tell me that.

148
00:15:30,129 --> 00:15:32,962
- Should I call the police?
- Heh, the police?

149
00:15:32,998 --> 00:15:35,398
Sugar-britches, we own the police.

150
00:15:37,536 --> 00:15:41,802
- We gonna have a problem?
- No, we don't have a problem.

151
00:15:41,841 --> 00:15:44,833
Ringo is the one with the problem--

152
00:15:47,012 --> 00:15:49,446
20,000 problems.

153
00:15:49,482 --> 00:15:52,178
Now I'm gonna give you
till the end of the month

154
00:15:52,218 --> 00:15:54,778
and that's only 'cause I like you.

155
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:56,811
I wanna see you still breathing.

156
00:16:04,930 --> 00:16:06,591
Jeez, did your cut open?

157
00:16:06,632 --> 00:16:08,259
I don't know.
I can't feel anything.

158
00:17:09,028 --> 00:17:10,996
Who's looking after the bar?

159
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:12,793
The boys in the front can handle it.

160
00:17:12,832 --> 00:17:17,292
- Just hold still.
- You've done this before?

161
00:17:17,336 --> 00:17:21,329
Two brothers
who always fought and...

162
00:17:23,209 --> 00:17:25,268
an unused degree in nursing.

163
00:17:25,311 --> 00:17:28,178
- You didn't want to become a nurse?
- I liked the hours.

164
00:17:28,214 --> 00:17:31,581
I-- I didn't like the suffering.

165
00:17:32,852 --> 00:17:37,016
So I work at a strip club instead.

166
00:17:37,056 --> 00:17:41,083
That tray to the throat--
that was pretty good.

167
00:17:41,126 --> 00:17:43,856
Yeah, I got game.

168
00:17:45,064 --> 00:17:47,032
So you gonna tell me
what that was all about?

169
00:17:47,066 --> 00:17:50,297
That was Sergio
and his bodyguard Razer.

170
00:17:50,336 --> 00:17:52,804
And what does he do?

171
00:17:52,838 --> 00:17:55,500
Sergio's a businessman.

172
00:17:55,541 --> 00:17:57,270
There was a time
when I used to gamble

173
00:17:57,309 --> 00:17:59,607
and it was his business
to collect after I lost.

174
00:17:59,645 --> 00:18:03,240
So why'd you keep losing?

175
00:18:03,282 --> 00:18:05,876
I kept on betting on myself to win.

176
00:18:07,987 --> 00:18:10,080
Well, that wasn't so smart, now was it?

177
00:18:19,531 --> 00:18:22,932
- Take the night off.
- You sure?

178
00:18:22,968 --> 00:18:25,596
Yeah, I got it here.
No worries.

179
00:18:29,842 --> 00:18:31,833
Thanks.

180
00:18:36,015 --> 00:18:37,983
I'll be here.

181
00:20:41,974 --> 00:20:44,204
- So?
- You'd be a lot more impressive

182
00:20:44,243 --> 00:20:46,211
if you could use that left
once in a while.

183
00:20:46,245 --> 00:20:48,338
- Just hold the bag, okay?
- All right.

184
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:50,007
What is this?

185
00:20:50,049 --> 00:20:52,517
The Spanish show pony

186
00:20:52,551 --> 00:20:54,781
or the donkey's ass?

187
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:56,788
- What the hell's he doing here?
- I don't know.

188
00:20:56,822 --> 00:20:59,290
- I hope he's not here to--
- I'm here to train, fellas.

189
00:20:59,324 --> 00:21:02,122
- Get ready for school.
- Now, Alonso, you know your--

190
00:21:02,161 --> 00:21:04,288
- Where was he staying?
- Upper West Side.

191
00:21:04,329 --> 00:21:06,422
Upper West Side money's
not good in this gym.

192
00:21:06,465 --> 00:21:08,933
Yeah? That's not
what your ex-wife said.

193
00:21:11,537 --> 00:21:13,562
Well, she got what she deserved,
which was you.

194
00:21:13,605 --> 00:21:15,072
Hold the bag.
Come on.

195
00:21:15,107 --> 00:21:19,168
So how's the left arm there, Ringo?

196
00:21:21,447 --> 00:21:24,416
- Left arm is fine.
- Oh, really?

197
00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:26,577
Hey, man,
this is a training gym, okay?

198
00:21:26,618 --> 00:21:28,279
This ain't a fucking schoolyard.

199
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:30,220
Who the fuck is this?
The new girlfriend?

200
00:21:30,255 --> 00:21:32,018
Who the hell are you calling girlfriend?

201
00:21:32,057 --> 00:21:33,217
Hey hey hey, relax, man.

202
00:21:33,258 --> 00:21:36,557
What the hell's going on?
Do not disrespect my gym.

203
00:21:36,595 --> 00:21:39,393
You two guys wanna fight,
there's the ring.

204
00:21:40,933 --> 00:21:42,594
Relax, man.
It's just training.

205
00:21:42,634 --> 00:21:44,795
See? That's the difference
between you and me.

206
00:21:44,837 --> 00:21:46,930
Every fight's a title fight.

207
00:21:50,609 --> 00:21:51,837
Watch it, Ringo.

208
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:57,141
Focus your punches, Alonso.

209
00:21:57,182 --> 00:21:59,412
Target's right in front of you.

210
00:21:59,451 --> 00:22:03,217
Focus your punches,
focus your punches.

211
00:22:07,526 --> 00:22:09,790
Come on, Ringo.
Attaboy. There you go.

212
00:22:09,828 --> 00:22:11,489
Get your range, get your range.

213
00:22:18,537 --> 00:22:20,004
- Oh, man.
- It's on his arm.

214
00:22:20,038 --> 00:22:21,130
I know.

215
00:22:25,744 --> 00:22:27,974
All right, everybody,
let's get back to work here.

216
00:22:28,013 --> 00:22:30,072
Training's over, old man.

217
00:22:31,817 --> 00:22:34,149
And there ain't nothing
wrong with my focus.

218
00:22:34,186 --> 00:22:36,177
All right, whatever.

219
00:22:41,393 --> 00:22:43,156
You just let anybody into the gym?

220
00:22:43,195 --> 00:22:44,958
The thing about Alonso's money

221
00:22:44,997 --> 00:22:46,658
is it's much better than anybody else's

222
00:22:46,698 --> 00:22:48,723
because he's actually got some.

223
00:22:48,767 --> 00:22:49,859
Well, he's an animal.

224
00:22:49,902 --> 00:22:51,563
Well, why don't you give him a run then?

225
00:22:51,603 --> 00:22:53,537
Show him his place.

226
00:22:53,572 --> 00:22:56,097
Tonight on "Torko" we cover
the Maximum Cage Warrior League

227
00:22:56,141 --> 00:22:57,130
direct from New York.

228
00:22:57,176 --> 00:22:59,667
Now joining us in studio
is the league's commissioner,

229
00:22:59,711 --> 00:23:04,671
Brian Waite, alongside the undisputed,
undefeated champion of the world,

230
00:23:04,716 --> 00:23:06,843
Christopher "The Pressure" Holland.

231
00:23:06,885 --> 00:23:10,719
- You make that sound so nice.
- Okay.

232
00:23:10,756 --> 00:23:14,419
Pressure Holland-- now there's
a real killer submission hold master.

233
00:23:14,459 --> 00:23:16,188
Try to listen to this.

234
00:23:16,228 --> 00:23:18,526
Brought Christopher along
to make the announcement.

235
00:23:18,564 --> 00:23:20,998
Now Pressure here put
this organization on the map

236
00:23:21,033 --> 00:23:24,127
and he is our brightest,
most brutally talented fighter.

237
00:23:24,169 --> 00:23:26,296
- Isn't that right, Pressure?
- Please don't stop.

238
00:23:26,338 --> 00:23:27,862
No, I'm just kidding.
But...

239
00:23:27,906 --> 00:23:30,773
- What a cool guy.
- Don't let him fool you.

240
00:23:30,809 --> 00:23:34,643
So you're looking
to discover the undiscovered.

241
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:36,841
That's right.
Today we're accepting applications

242
00:23:36,882 --> 00:23:39,146
for the most incredible
elite competition

243
00:23:39,184 --> 00:23:42,312
to find the greatest
undiscovered fighter in the world.

244
00:23:42,354 --> 00:23:46,290
Our finalist will go up against a pro
for the title and an MCW contract--

245
00:23:46,325 --> 00:23:48,953
that is if anyone thinks
they have what it takes.

246
00:23:48,994 --> 00:23:50,518
Now correct me if I'm wrong,

247
00:23:50,562 --> 00:23:53,053
but that pro would be yourself,
Christopher.

248
00:23:53,098 --> 00:23:55,589
- Well, yeah.
- He's the best of the best over here.

249
00:23:55,634 --> 00:23:57,602
- You kidding me?
- And I am the best, you know.

250
00:23:57,636 --> 00:24:01,163
- And I will remain that way.
- There you have it.

251
00:24:02,441 --> 00:24:04,466
That's why Alonso's back.

252
00:24:04,509 --> 00:24:06,909
Alonso's trying to go pro?

253
00:24:06,945 --> 00:24:10,073
Yeah. Know anybody else
who might be interested?

254
00:24:10,115 --> 00:24:12,481
No? Thought not.

255
00:24:14,119 --> 00:24:17,577
Okay, let's go.
No rest for the wicked.

256
00:24:17,623 --> 00:24:19,591
Don't waste time in here.

257
00:24:19,625 --> 00:24:23,686
Sometimes a fighter
brings his own fight.

258
00:24:23,729 --> 00:24:27,995
Other times you gotta bring
that fight to the fighters.

259
00:24:28,033 --> 00:24:30,001
When two wild animals

260
00:24:30,035 --> 00:24:33,027
are locked up in a cage together,

261
00:24:33,071 --> 00:24:37,565
sometimes that could make
a fighter more hungry.

262
00:25:13,011 --> 00:25:16,276
Don't tell Ringo I snuck in again, okay?

263
00:25:16,315 --> 00:25:18,283
My lips are sealed,

264
00:25:18,317 --> 00:25:20,683
but only for a little while, sugar.

265
00:25:20,719 --> 00:25:23,847
Do you believe in--

266
00:25:23,889 --> 00:25:25,857
dest-- do you believe in destiny?

267
00:25:25,891 --> 00:25:28,985
Yeah, I mean she's a great girl.

268
00:25:29,027 --> 00:25:30,995
Yeah, she is.

269
00:25:31,029 --> 00:25:33,964
No no, but I mean like fate.

270
00:25:33,999 --> 00:25:37,264
I know, pumpkin.
I was just making a funny.

271
00:25:43,308 --> 00:25:45,902
Look, listen, do you think

272
00:25:45,944 --> 00:25:47,707
unless sometimes people are pushed

273
00:25:47,746 --> 00:25:49,714
they'll never reach
their full potential?

274
00:25:49,748 --> 00:25:54,242
Well, I think that you're reaching

275
00:25:54,286 --> 00:25:58,313
your full potential right now

276
00:25:58,357 --> 00:26:00,723
without doing any pushing.

277
00:26:00,759 --> 00:26:02,750
No, seriously.

278
00:26:06,765 --> 00:26:09,233
Come to the edge.

279
00:26:09,267 --> 00:26:11,064
But we might fall.

280
00:26:11,103 --> 00:26:12,866
Come to the edge.

281
00:26:12,904 --> 00:26:15,702
But it's too high!

282
00:26:15,741 --> 00:26:17,732
COME TO THE EDGE!

283
00:26:19,745 --> 00:26:23,772
And they came, and he pushed,

284
00:26:23,815 --> 00:26:25,806
and they flew.

285
00:26:27,719 --> 00:26:31,155
Poet Christopher Logue.

286
00:26:33,058 --> 00:26:37,927
- Who are you?
- My real name's Gwendolyn.

287
00:26:37,963 --> 00:26:40,557
Gwendolyn.

288
00:26:40,599 --> 00:26:44,763
Does this club have a computer
hooked up to the Internet?

289
00:26:46,872 --> 00:26:50,467
- What are you doing?
- One second. Work work work.

290
00:26:50,509 --> 00:26:52,477
Come on.

291
00:26:54,980 --> 00:26:56,345
Done.

292
00:26:56,381 --> 00:26:57,814
Thank you.

293
00:26:57,849 --> 00:27:00,613
I just might have saved
my best friend's life.

294
00:27:00,652 --> 00:27:04,315
Aw, you are so sweet.

295
00:27:04,356 --> 00:27:07,120
And you might just be stealing
my heart right from my chest.

296
00:27:26,578 --> 00:27:29,103
You shouldn't be out so late, Ringo.

297
00:27:29,147 --> 00:27:31,274
Your boss said I had a month.

298
00:27:31,316 --> 00:27:35,275
I'm off the clock.

299
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:37,311
See...

300
00:27:38,890 --> 00:27:42,382
I didn't like how we ended
the night last night.

301
00:27:42,427 --> 00:27:44,395
What?

302
00:27:44,429 --> 00:27:46,397
With you being beat up by a girl?

303
00:28:31,109 --> 00:28:33,168
Drop it! Drop the knife!

304
00:28:44,823 --> 00:28:46,450
You see, Razer,

305
00:28:46,491 --> 00:28:49,722
you brought a knife to a bottle fight.

306
00:28:49,761 --> 00:28:54,562
Now your boss said I had a month.

307
00:28:54,599 --> 00:28:57,466
I suggest you let me have it, okay?

308
00:28:59,204 --> 00:29:02,367
Now go to a hospital.
You're gonna need stitches in that.

309
00:29:02,407 --> 00:29:04,375
What?

310
00:29:04,409 --> 00:29:07,003
I'm trying to teach you
to be a fighter, not a goon.

311
00:29:07,045 --> 00:29:09,104
Go!

312
00:29:16,421 --> 00:29:18,412
Hey!

313
00:29:27,165 --> 00:29:30,293
- What happened? Are you hurt?
- Always.

314
00:29:30,335 --> 00:29:32,428
You're bleeding.

315
00:29:32,470 --> 00:29:35,496
I don't think this is mine.

316
00:29:35,540 --> 00:29:37,599
Jesus, you leave my sight
for 10 minutes...

317
00:29:37,642 --> 00:29:41,271
- Let's get you to a hospital.
- Not a good idea.

318
00:29:41,313 --> 00:29:43,679
I just sent the other guy there.

319
00:29:43,715 --> 00:29:46,275
Well, you can't lay here bleeding
in a strip club parking lot.

320
00:29:46,318 --> 00:29:48,684
You'll give this establishment
a bad name.

321
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:51,348
Let's go.

322
00:30:02,367 --> 00:30:04,927
Whoa whoa.
Okay.

323
00:30:06,771 --> 00:30:09,831
There's a light here.

324
00:30:09,874 --> 00:30:11,842
Are you good?

325
00:30:11,876 --> 00:30:15,277
Yeah, I'm good.
There used to be a couch there.

326
00:30:24,089 --> 00:30:26,751
So what got you into fighting
in the first place?

327
00:30:26,791 --> 00:30:29,555
- It's been in the family.
- Yeah? Your dad?

328
00:30:29,594 --> 00:30:33,121
- No, my mom.
- Really?

329
00:30:36,735 --> 00:30:39,295
She was a fighter.

330
00:30:39,337 --> 00:30:41,669
She was a good fighter.

331
00:30:43,642 --> 00:30:45,576
You know, I'd think
a mother wouldn't want

332
00:30:45,610 --> 00:30:48,340
to see her son get beat up so much.

333
00:30:48,380 --> 00:30:50,348
She never did.

334
00:30:50,382 --> 00:30:53,647
She died shortly after
the picture was taken.

335
00:30:58,123 --> 00:31:00,114
Sorry.

336
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:04,155
That's okay, she didn't mean to.

337
00:31:11,302 --> 00:31:15,329
So why do you love it
so much-- fighting?

338
00:31:15,373 --> 00:31:17,898
Fighting?

339
00:31:17,942 --> 00:31:20,433
Simple.

340
00:31:20,478 --> 00:31:23,038
I don't have to worry about any of this.

341
00:31:24,716 --> 00:31:28,447
You know, for those
few minutes in the cage...

342
00:31:30,355 --> 00:31:33,950
I feel like I belong in this world.

343
00:31:35,894 --> 00:31:39,421
I may go down 100 times,

344
00:31:39,464 --> 00:31:42,058
but I am determined
to get up 101 times.

345
00:31:44,736 --> 00:31:47,864
And when I'm getting up,

346
00:31:47,906 --> 00:31:51,740
just in that second,

347
00:31:51,776 --> 00:31:55,837
I'm happy, fearless.

348
00:31:57,282 --> 00:32:00,274
Just in that second

349
00:32:00,318 --> 00:32:02,309
I feel like a winner, you know.

350
00:32:05,056 --> 00:32:08,184
What's with the arm?

351
00:32:08,226 --> 00:32:11,457
Nothing. Arm is fine.

352
00:32:11,496 --> 00:32:13,464
Bullshit.

353
00:32:13,498 --> 00:32:15,466
I've watched you for a month

354
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:17,468
lift almost everything with one hand.

355
00:32:17,502 --> 00:32:19,493
What gives?

356
00:32:23,808 --> 00:32:25,366
Does this hurt?

357
00:32:26,644 --> 00:32:29,306
High pain tolerance, huh?

358
00:32:30,582 --> 00:32:33,608
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.

359
00:32:35,553 --> 00:32:39,353
Son of a g--

360
00:32:43,795 --> 00:32:45,763
Dislocated?
How did-- how did you know--

361
00:32:45,797 --> 00:32:47,765
It's called a subluxation.

362
00:32:47,799 --> 00:32:50,290
It's a partial dislocation.

363
00:32:50,335 --> 00:32:52,326
It's hard to tell.

364
00:32:53,938 --> 00:32:56,771
Don't worry, it'll-- it'll heal.

365
00:32:59,043 --> 00:33:01,011
Wow.

366
00:33:01,045 --> 00:33:03,536
Is there anything you don't know?

367
00:33:23,034 --> 00:33:24,399
Watch out, the arm.

368
00:33:25,737 --> 00:33:27,602
Take the pain, Rocky.

369
00:33:29,874 --> 00:33:33,310
I think I'm gonna need
your help with the shirt.

370
00:33:35,580 --> 00:33:38,344
- You're trying to kill me.
- Sorry.

371
00:33:38,383 --> 00:33:40,283
Sorry about your other arm.

372
00:33:40,318 --> 00:33:41,876
That was the good one.

373
00:33:43,454 --> 00:33:45,445
That's the bad one.

374
00:33:46,658 --> 00:33:49,183
- Does that hurt?
- Yeah.

375
00:33:49,227 --> 00:33:50,819
- Okay, 'cause I can go.
- No!

376
00:33:50,862 --> 00:33:52,659
- No, I can stop.
- No no no no.

377
00:33:52,697 --> 00:33:56,224
- I kind of had plans anyway.
- I was just playing. I was playing.

378
00:34:54,259 --> 00:34:57,456
How the hell did he end up in there?

379
00:34:57,495 --> 00:35:00,123
- That's Ringo Duran.
- Yeah, I know who it is.

380
00:35:00,164 --> 00:35:02,462
How'd he pass our screening?

381
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:04,468
His mother's in the Hall of Fame,
Christopher.

382
00:35:04,502 --> 00:35:07,630
Look, the guy's a bum.

383
00:35:07,672 --> 00:35:09,640
He's a loser.

384
00:35:09,674 --> 00:35:11,608
And everybody knows he has a gimpy arm

385
00:35:11,643 --> 00:35:13,611
and nothing left in the tank.

386
00:35:13,645 --> 00:35:16,079
Yeah, but he's got heart.

387
00:35:16,114 --> 00:35:18,105
The crowd loves heart.

388
00:35:18,149 --> 00:35:22,609
The crowd will love
what we decide they love.

389
00:35:22,654 --> 00:35:24,212
Right?

390
00:35:24,255 --> 00:35:26,382
Well, the last time
I checked, Christopher,

391
00:35:26,424 --> 00:35:29,484
the letters CEO were after my name
outside that door.

392
00:35:31,162 --> 00:35:33,289
Well, let me tell you something,
Billy Bad-ass.

393
00:35:33,331 --> 00:35:36,323
I'm the one who put this organization
on the map, okay?

394
00:35:36,367 --> 00:35:40,804
Well, contractually I'm obligated
to say that on national television,

395
00:35:40,838 --> 00:35:43,602
but not here in this boardroom.

396
00:35:43,641 --> 00:35:47,907
Come on, Pressure, we could
do worse than Ringo Duran.

397
00:35:47,946 --> 00:35:51,347
Look, let's just-- let's see
what we've got there.

398
00:35:51,382 --> 00:35:52,440
How about this guy?

399
00:35:52,483 --> 00:35:55,213
I seen him in the Pro-Am in California.

400
00:35:55,253 --> 00:35:57,813
Alonso Scott?
He's good.

401
00:35:57,855 --> 00:36:00,221
Wild, but dangerous.

402
00:36:00,258 --> 00:36:04,194
- Yeah, he's got a bad attitude.
- He's got a bad attitude?

403
00:36:04,228 --> 00:36:06,389
This is Maximum Cage Warriors.

404
00:36:06,431 --> 00:36:08,661
Everybody has a bad attitude.

405
00:36:13,972 --> 00:36:16,065
Hey hey hey, what are you doing?

406
00:36:16,107 --> 00:36:19,008
I'm annihilating this heavy bag
with my fists of steel.

407
00:36:19,043 --> 00:36:21,011
Your fists of steel?

408
00:36:21,045 --> 00:36:23,036
Let me give you some advice, okay?

409
00:36:24,682 --> 00:36:27,651
For some fighters it's all about volume,

410
00:36:27,685 --> 00:36:29,482
especially if you're young like you.

411
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:32,819
So my advice for you
is you go on numbers.

412
00:36:32,857 --> 00:36:34,518
Something like this.

413
00:36:36,861 --> 00:36:39,659
- Right?
- Well, what about you?

414
00:36:39,697 --> 00:36:43,497
For me it's best to sit back,

415
00:36:43,534 --> 00:36:45,593
take in the flow of the fight,

416
00:36:45,636 --> 00:36:48,298
look for an opening
or create an opening.

417
00:36:48,339 --> 00:36:51,001
And when I got it...

418
00:36:51,042 --> 00:36:53,909
I take it.
One shot might be all I get.

419
00:36:53,945 --> 00:36:55,936
Wait, was that your left arm?

420
00:36:57,582 --> 00:36:59,550
What the hell happened
to you last night?

421
00:36:59,584 --> 00:37:03,247
Yeah, I was about to ask you
the same question.

422
00:37:03,287 --> 00:37:06,051
All right, we are here
to announce our selection

423
00:37:06,090 --> 00:37:08,524
for the MCW
100th MMA tournament

424
00:37:08,559 --> 00:37:10,026
and we've certainly gotta tell you

425
00:37:10,061 --> 00:37:12,427
we found some undiscovered gems.

426
00:37:12,463 --> 00:37:14,192
Absolutely, we have found four

427
00:37:14,232 --> 00:37:15,893
of the greatest amateur fighters...

428
00:37:15,933 --> 00:37:17,730
Come on, say my name already.

429
00:37:17,769 --> 00:37:21,227
Well, Pressure, since you put this
organization on the map,

430
00:37:21,272 --> 00:37:23,240
why don't you start us off?

431
00:37:23,274 --> 00:37:27,335
Our first selection is one of the most
lethal fighters out there--

432
00:37:27,378 --> 00:37:29,505
Landon "The Brother" Popoff.

433
00:37:29,547 --> 00:37:32,983
- They must have disqualified Luca.
- Asshole.

434
00:37:33,017 --> 00:37:34,609
Straight out of San Francisco,

435
00:37:34,652 --> 00:37:36,711
the original back alley brawler,

436
00:37:36,754 --> 00:37:38,779
Seville "Fingers" Duarte.

437
00:37:38,823 --> 00:37:41,291
Yeah, I told you.

438
00:37:41,325 --> 00:37:43,987
And I'm very proud to announce
our next selection--

439
00:37:44,028 --> 00:37:46,258
New Jersey's very own Alonso Scott.

440
00:37:46,297 --> 00:37:49,789
- Yeah!
- That's right. You heard him.

441
00:37:49,834 --> 00:37:51,665
And last but certainly not least--

442
00:37:51,702 --> 00:37:54,637
never have we seen a more true
underdog with real pedigree.

443
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:58,105
Ringo Duran.

444
00:37:58,142 --> 00:38:00,576
- Yes!
- What?

445
00:38:00,611 --> 00:38:02,340
Hey, you finally came to your senses.

446
00:38:02,380 --> 00:38:04,280
- It must be a mistake.
- I don't think--

447
00:38:04,315 --> 00:38:05,782
You're damn right it's a mistake.

448
00:38:05,817 --> 00:38:07,842
Nobody would let a sad
sack of shit like you in there.

449
00:38:07,885 --> 00:38:09,182
Okay, Alonso, let's go.

450
00:38:09,220 --> 00:38:11,051
This bum don't need to be
in the same ring as me.

451
00:38:11,089 --> 00:38:13,216
Let's get back to work, please.
Let's everybody.

452
00:38:13,257 --> 00:38:15,987
Someone get the TV.
Let's go, let's go.

453
00:38:16,027 --> 00:38:17,722
Beautiful.

454
00:38:17,762 --> 00:38:19,730
I never applied for the tournament.

455
00:38:19,764 --> 00:38:21,561
- You didn't?
- No.

456
00:38:21,599 --> 00:38:23,590
Then who did?

457
00:38:27,004 --> 00:38:29,063
What?
What were you thinking?

458
00:38:29,107 --> 00:38:31,234
I thought that maybe
this would be good for you.

459
00:38:31,275 --> 00:38:33,004
How could this possibly be good for me?

460
00:38:33,044 --> 00:38:34,807
You're the best fighter
they named today.

461
00:38:34,846 --> 00:38:36,905
Why, man? Why would
you enter without asking me?

462
00:38:36,948 --> 00:38:41,146
Because... you need to go to the edge.

463
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:44,347
- What?
- Yeah, you need to go to the edge.

464
00:38:44,388 --> 00:38:45,377
Look, Ringo...

465
00:38:45,423 --> 00:38:48,051
Okay, look, you need
to go to the edge, okay?

466
00:38:48,092 --> 00:38:50,390
I mean, look look, we might fall.

467
00:38:50,428 --> 00:38:51,895
Go to the edge.

468
00:38:51,929 --> 00:38:55,194
It's-- it's too high.
Go to the edge, okay?

469
00:38:55,233 --> 00:38:59,693
And you came, and I pushed,
and you flew.

470
00:38:59,737 --> 00:39:03,605
Poet Christopher Logue.

471
00:39:03,641 --> 00:39:05,871
- Are you high right now?
- What? No.

472
00:39:05,910 --> 00:39:07,741
Listen, Ringo, sometimes a man--

473
00:39:07,778 --> 00:39:11,145
he needs to be pushed over the edge
to find out his true destiny.

474
00:39:11,182 --> 00:39:13,150
Did you sleep with that girl
yesterday night?

475
00:39:13,184 --> 00:39:16,210
- No, l--
- Tell me you slept with the girl.

476
00:39:16,254 --> 00:39:18,381
Tell me you fell in love with her

477
00:39:18,422 --> 00:39:20,822
so I don't beat the shit
out of you right now, okay?

478
00:39:20,858 --> 00:39:24,191
No. Yes, l...

479
00:39:24,228 --> 00:39:26,662
Look, I might have seen Gwendolyn
for a bit last night.

480
00:39:26,697 --> 00:39:29,222
- Who?
- Gwendolyn-- Pepper.

481
00:39:29,267 --> 00:39:31,292
It's Pepper.

482
00:39:31,335 --> 00:39:32,393
- Pepper.
- Yeah.

483
00:39:32,436 --> 00:39:34,063
And she teach you this, right?

484
00:39:34,105 --> 00:39:35,766
I might have picked it up from her.

485
00:39:35,806 --> 00:39:38,832
Well, stop learning poetry
from strippers.

486
00:39:38,876 --> 00:39:40,867
Nothing good can come
out of that, okay?

487
00:39:40,912 --> 00:39:42,846
Break it up, guys.
Let's go.

488
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:44,677
We're waiting for you.

489
00:39:46,250 --> 00:39:48,218
- You want me to train with him?
- Yes, I do.

490
00:39:48,252 --> 00:39:51,551
I got two fighters on the biggest
amateur ticket of the decade.

491
00:39:51,589 --> 00:39:53,580
I want one of you to survive.
Come on, let's go.

492
00:39:55,459 --> 00:39:57,757
What's the matter?

493
00:39:57,795 --> 00:39:59,558
Ringo, one-time offer right now.

494
00:39:59,597 --> 00:40:02,225
Do you want me
as your corner guy or not?

495
00:40:02,266 --> 00:40:05,064
- Yes yes, he does, Raphael.
- Does he?

496
00:40:05,102 --> 00:40:06,330
He does.

497
00:40:06,370 --> 00:40:07,860
Tell him how much the top prize is.

498
00:40:07,905 --> 00:40:09,873
$100,000.

499
00:40:09,907 --> 00:40:13,741
$100,000?
That's a lot of money.

500
00:40:13,778 --> 00:40:14,938
So what's it gonna be?

501
00:40:14,979 --> 00:40:16,947
Are you here for the workout,
just to shed a few pounds,

502
00:40:16,981 --> 00:40:18,448
or do you want me to train you up

503
00:40:18,482 --> 00:40:20,541
for the biggest challenge
you're ever gonna face

504
00:40:20,585 --> 00:40:23,918
against the best opposition
on the world's biggest stage?

505
00:40:23,955 --> 00:40:26,890
- Well, if you put it that way...
- All right.

506
00:40:26,924 --> 00:40:30,189
Well, then you're gonna have to
trust me to do the best thing.

507
00:40:30,228 --> 00:40:32,219
Let's go.

508
00:40:34,665 --> 00:40:38,362
Hey, you're a daisy if you do.

509
00:40:38,402 --> 00:40:42,031
- What the hell does that mean?
- I'm not sure.

510
00:40:42,073 --> 00:40:44,405
Did he call you a daisy?

511
00:40:48,713 --> 00:40:52,615
Look, let's just put Ringo Duran
with Alonso Scott

512
00:40:52,650 --> 00:40:54,208
and let them at each other's throat.

513
00:40:54,252 --> 00:40:56,311
No no, we need a story to tell.

514
00:40:56,354 --> 00:40:58,549
Ringo and Alonso is the match-up.

515
00:40:58,589 --> 00:41:00,056
They're from the same gym,

516
00:41:00,091 --> 00:41:01,991
they both fought
in the same backroom cages.

517
00:41:02,026 --> 00:41:03,789
So that's what we'll go with.

518
00:41:03,828 --> 00:41:06,922
No, this is the ticket.

519
00:41:06,964 --> 00:41:10,661
We need to build towards it
like a perfect storm.

520
00:41:10,701 --> 00:41:13,169
We need to...

521
00:41:16,540 --> 00:41:18,735
Look at this.
Landon Popoff.

522
00:41:18,776 --> 00:41:21,939
Ringo and Landon's brother
fought at Breaks Shoe Shop.

523
00:41:21,979 --> 00:41:24,106
It was a goddamn mess.

524
00:41:24,148 --> 00:41:27,709
We put Landon in the cage to avenge
his brother being blacklisted.

525
00:41:27,752 --> 00:41:30,482
We call it-- I don't know--
Redemption.

526
00:41:31,489 --> 00:41:33,650
Ringo wins, Alonso advances.

527
00:41:33,691 --> 00:41:37,684
We have the perfect
clash of the titans.

528
00:41:39,096 --> 00:41:41,724
Look, there's a lot of ifs.

529
00:41:41,766 --> 00:41:44,496
Hell, if if was a fifth,
we'd all be drunk.

530
00:41:44,535 --> 00:41:47,629
If Alonso and Ringo don't fight,
we blow our blockbuster.

531
00:41:47,672 --> 00:41:49,139
And that's the bigger question.

532
00:41:49,173 --> 00:41:53,576
Can your guy advance
past The Brother?

533
00:41:53,611 --> 00:41:56,774
Are you worried about defending
your title against Ringo?

534
00:41:56,814 --> 00:41:58,782
I'm The Pressure.

535
00:41:58,816 --> 00:42:02,582
I don't worry about nobody;
people worry about me.

536
00:42:02,620 --> 00:42:04,918
You know what I'm saying?
Here's what we're gonna do.

537
00:42:06,490 --> 00:42:11,325
We're gonna do Landon versus Ringo.

538
00:42:11,362 --> 00:42:15,059
That is a great idea that you just had.

539
00:42:15,099 --> 00:42:17,499
You're damn right it's a great idea.

540
00:42:17,535 --> 00:42:19,526
Marcy, get that down, please.

541
00:42:19,570 --> 00:42:21,629
Yeah, Marcy, put that down.
And can you quote him?

542
00:42:21,672 --> 00:42:23,640
Just "The Pressure"?

543
00:42:23,674 --> 00:42:27,770
- You got jokes, huh?
- 'Cause "The Pressure" says it's true.

544
00:42:27,812 --> 00:42:29,905
Hey, you better pump your brakes, baby.

545
00:42:29,947 --> 00:42:30,936
Just saying.

546
00:42:30,981 --> 00:42:32,972
Just pump the brakes.
That's all I'm saying.

547
00:42:35,653 --> 00:42:38,520
You okay with that?
He's dirtier than his brother.

548
00:42:38,556 --> 00:42:41,616
Yeah, you just make sure he doesn't
have a crowbar down his pants.

549
00:42:41,659 --> 00:42:44,685
Ringo, let's go.

550
00:42:44,729 --> 00:42:46,697
Gotta hit the weights.

551
00:42:52,870 --> 00:42:54,531
Get up.

552
00:44:21,492 --> 00:44:26,259
- He said only boxing, man.
- This is fighting, not horseshoes.

553
00:44:27,531 --> 00:44:29,192
Okay, Alonso, Alonso.

554
00:44:29,233 --> 00:44:30,962
Okay okay okay okay,
that's enough.

555
00:44:31,001 --> 00:44:33,162
The hell it's enough.

556
00:44:33,204 --> 00:44:35,195
You're both weak.

557
00:44:35,239 --> 00:44:37,799
You think this guy's your ticket?
Then you are delusional.

558
00:44:37,842 --> 00:44:40,538
Two broken down old men
with no titles and no balls.

559
00:44:40,578 --> 00:44:42,603
Hey, you can disrespect me,

560
00:44:42,646 --> 00:44:44,614
but don't disrespect Raphael, okay?

561
00:44:44,648 --> 00:44:46,775
Why? Because he coached
some bitch to a championship

562
00:44:46,817 --> 00:44:47,806
back in the Stone Ages?

563
00:44:47,852 --> 00:44:49,410
Her name was Gracie Duran.

564
00:44:49,453 --> 00:44:51,683
And for your information,
it was actually

565
00:44:51,722 --> 00:44:54,714
five world championships
in three different disciplines,

566
00:44:54,758 --> 00:44:58,353
and she had more talent
in one painted little pinky finger

567
00:44:58,395 --> 00:45:00,363
than you have in your 205 lbs.

568
00:45:00,397 --> 00:45:03,366
Whatever, man.
Whatever.

569
00:45:03,400 --> 00:45:06,392
Take your gloves off and leave the gym.

570
00:45:08,772 --> 00:45:10,740
You're gonna choose him over me?

571
00:45:10,774 --> 00:45:13,868
There's no choice to be made here.
You already made it for me.

572
00:45:17,181 --> 00:45:20,617
- We'll settle this in the cage then.
- Looking forward to it!

573
00:45:25,422 --> 00:45:28,016
Sorry, Raphael.

574
00:45:28,058 --> 00:45:30,686
Nothing to be sorry for.

575
00:45:30,728 --> 00:45:32,855
You think I wanted to train
that piece of shit?

576
00:45:32,897 --> 00:45:35,627
Fucking lowlife.
He has no respect.

577
00:45:35,666 --> 00:45:38,601
He does not respect even
the canvas that we walk on.

578
00:45:38,636 --> 00:45:42,333
The only reason I kept him around
after the announcements were made

579
00:45:42,373 --> 00:45:44,341
was to make you better.

580
00:45:44,375 --> 00:45:46,366
My money's on you.

581
00:45:50,748 --> 00:45:52,215
Maybe we'll call it a day, eh?

582
00:45:52,249 --> 00:45:53,841
You took a lot of punishment.

583
00:45:55,319 --> 00:45:57,344
No, let's keep on training.

584
00:45:57,388 --> 00:45:59,356
Let's go.

585
00:45:59,390 --> 00:46:01,051
Hey, I need a new sparring partner.

586
00:46:01,091 --> 00:46:03,150
Get your shit together.
Let's go.

587
00:46:08,432 --> 00:46:09,899
It's me.

588
00:46:09,934 --> 00:46:11,595
I'm here.

589
00:46:11,635 --> 00:46:16,072
- Where are you?
- In the tub.

590
00:46:18,208 --> 00:46:21,507
- Having a little soak?
- Yeah.

591
00:46:21,545 --> 00:46:24,343
And how is your shoulder feeling?

592
00:46:25,349 --> 00:46:27,681
- It's feeling.
- Good.

593
00:46:30,487 --> 00:46:33,479
So your day was good?

594
00:46:33,524 --> 00:46:35,958
- Interesting.
- Really?

595
00:46:35,993 --> 00:46:38,188
Mm-hmm.

596
00:46:38,228 --> 00:46:42,392
Well, it's about to get
a little more interesting.

597
00:46:43,601 --> 00:46:45,796
May l?

598
00:46:49,673 --> 00:46:52,107
Well?

599
00:46:52,142 --> 00:46:54,804
- I'm thinking.
- Screw you.

600
00:47:02,286 --> 00:47:04,254
Raphael dropped Alonso today,

601
00:47:04,288 --> 00:47:06,153
kicked him out of the gym.

602
00:47:06,190 --> 00:47:08,954
I thought Alonso was supposed
to be the Second Coming.

603
00:47:08,993 --> 00:47:11,484
So did l.

604
00:47:11,528 --> 00:47:14,622
But it seems Raphael wants to back me.

605
00:47:14,665 --> 00:47:17,327
Well, he's a wise man.

606
00:47:20,170 --> 00:47:21,831
I have an idea.

607
00:47:21,872 --> 00:47:24,966
I'm thinking after
the tournament's over,

608
00:47:25,009 --> 00:47:26,977
we should get out of here.

609
00:47:27,011 --> 00:47:30,071
It would be nice.
A restart.

610
00:47:49,633 --> 00:47:51,624
Come here.

611
00:47:57,307 --> 00:47:59,366
Ringo Duran.

612
00:47:59,410 --> 00:48:01,378
You must be a very wealthy man

613
00:48:01,412 --> 00:48:03,380
if you can afford to eat
in this restaurant

614
00:48:03,414 --> 00:48:05,382
and pay me back
the money you owe me.

615
00:48:05,416 --> 00:48:08,943
- Well, I'm neither.
- Then you're in purgatory.

616
00:48:08,986 --> 00:48:10,977
Let me drink to your lost soul.

617
00:48:16,527 --> 00:48:19,018
- Where's the goon?
- Razer?

618
00:48:21,699 --> 00:48:23,860
I'm not so sure about Razer anymore.

619
00:48:23,901 --> 00:48:26,893
Very hard to get good help these days,

620
00:48:26,937 --> 00:48:29,497
even with the economy the way it is.

621
00:48:29,540 --> 00:48:31,531
I would like to propose something.

622
00:48:33,977 --> 00:48:36,571
- What's this?
- The next fight.

623
00:48:38,382 --> 00:48:41,681
You're fighting in the MCW?

624
00:48:41,719 --> 00:48:44,153
And what does this have to do with me

625
00:48:44,188 --> 00:48:46,554
and the $20,000 you owe me?

626
00:48:46,590 --> 00:48:50,424
Top prize is $100,000.

627
00:48:50,461 --> 00:48:51,758
Okay.

628
00:48:51,795 --> 00:48:55,788
If I win, 50% of that is yours.

629
00:48:55,833 --> 00:48:58,461
How about if you win I keep it all,

630
00:48:58,502 --> 00:49:00,766
and I decide then and there
how much you get?

631
00:49:00,804 --> 00:49:04,103
If you kill me now, you get nothing
but a dry-cleaning bill

632
00:49:04,141 --> 00:49:06,268
to get my blood
out of your nice white suit.

633
00:49:06,310 --> 00:49:09,370
- What are you, a 10:1, 15:1?
- 25:1.

634
00:49:09,413 --> 00:49:11,608
25:1?

635
00:49:11,648 --> 00:49:14,378
Ringo, those are some odds.
That's some spread.

636
00:49:14,418 --> 00:49:17,444
One can make a lot of money
on those odds.

637
00:49:17,488 --> 00:49:21,117
- You can say that again.
- I'll think about it.

638
00:49:21,158 --> 00:49:23,456
When will I know?

639
00:49:23,494 --> 00:49:27,089
You'll know when you don't
wake up with a bullet in your head.

640
00:49:35,172 --> 00:49:38,300
The guy doesn't have
a goddamn chance in hell.

641
00:49:48,852 --> 00:49:50,820
Hey, it's me.

642
00:49:50,854 --> 00:49:52,981
What do you mean "Me who?"
you mother-cocksucker?

643
00:49:53,023 --> 00:49:56,322
It's Sergio.
You know that favor you owe me?

644
00:50:06,303 --> 00:50:09,500
Looks like it's gonna be quite a show.

645
00:50:09,540 --> 00:50:12,168
Nice.

646
00:50:12,209 --> 00:50:14,302
It's not that nice.

647
00:50:15,412 --> 00:50:17,607
It's pretty nice.

648
00:50:25,355 --> 00:50:27,346
Okay, it's pretty nice.

649
00:50:27,391 --> 00:50:29,359
This beats The Breaks.

650
00:50:29,393 --> 00:50:32,385
- Hey, Coach.
- What time do you call this?

651
00:50:32,429 --> 00:50:34,522
- How's your arm?
- Raphael.

652
00:50:34,565 --> 00:50:37,398
- Yeah?
- I want to introduce you to...

653
00:50:37,434 --> 00:50:40,062
- my friend Kara.
- Girlfriend.

654
00:50:40,103 --> 00:50:42,867
Does this guy know this?

655
00:50:42,906 --> 00:50:45,374
He does now.
Yeah.

656
00:50:45,409 --> 00:50:47,877
- Ringo's told me a lot about you.
- Has he?

657
00:50:47,911 --> 00:50:50,311
Well, he's told me jackshit
about you, sweetheart.

658
00:50:50,347 --> 00:50:53,248
Probably because he's afraid
I just might steal you away.

659
00:50:53,283 --> 00:50:55,843
She's blushing.
I like that.

660
00:50:55,886 --> 00:50:58,150
Come here.

661
00:50:58,188 --> 00:51:02,488
Boy, a long time since I seen
the insides of a venue like this.

662
00:51:02,526 --> 00:51:04,960
- Hopefully it won't be the last time.
- Yeah, hopefully.

663
00:51:04,995 --> 00:51:07,896
But we gotta get by
Popoff first, don't we?

664
00:51:07,931 --> 00:51:09,228
Or nothing.

665
00:51:09,266 --> 00:51:12,702
Now Popoff, he's a--
he's a cheating bastard,

666
00:51:12,736 --> 00:51:14,499
but me and Link,
we got you covered.

667
00:51:14,538 --> 00:51:16,233
It's more than that.

668
00:51:16,273 --> 00:51:19,265
I need you to do something for me
in that ring tonight, Ringo.

669
00:51:21,044 --> 00:51:24,013
- I want you to change up your style.
- What?

670
00:51:24,047 --> 00:51:26,447
Look, you're a graceful fighter.
That's why I love you.

671
00:51:26,483 --> 00:51:28,644
I know that anything he throws at you

672
00:51:28,685 --> 00:51:31,153
you can probably slip
or you can block, sidestep,

673
00:51:31,188 --> 00:51:35,921
but the problem is everyone
knows your-- knows your game.

674
00:51:35,959 --> 00:51:38,257
Popoff knows your game,
I know your game,

675
00:51:38,295 --> 00:51:39,762
everybody knows your game.

676
00:51:39,796 --> 00:51:41,263
The crowd does not.

677
00:51:41,298 --> 00:51:44,267
Now if you're gonna try
and dance your way

678
00:51:44,301 --> 00:51:45,859
through the first couple of rounds

679
00:51:45,903 --> 00:51:48,371
and avoid punches
and not throw too much back,

680
00:51:48,405 --> 00:51:50,430
it's gonna piss everybody off out there.

681
00:51:50,474 --> 00:51:53,409
And in a building like this,
if you lose the crowd--

682
00:51:53,443 --> 00:51:55,206
- You lose the fight.
- Exactly.

683
00:51:55,245 --> 00:51:56,872
There's the guy now.

684
00:51:56,914 --> 00:51:58,381
So this is what I want you to do.

685
00:51:58,415 --> 00:52:00,645
When that bell rings,
I want you to come

686
00:52:00,684 --> 00:52:02,276
out of that corner relentless.

687
00:52:02,319 --> 00:52:04,412
Just think about it, okay?

688
00:52:04,454 --> 00:52:06,217
- Do that for me, will you?
- Okay.

689
00:52:06,256 --> 00:52:08,656
- Raphael.
- I saw him. Can you get the door?

690
00:52:10,193 --> 00:52:11,888
Just lock it up in here now.

691
00:52:11,929 --> 00:52:14,420
All right? Think about
what I'm telling you, okay?

692
00:52:14,464 --> 00:52:16,728
Okay, let's go.
Let's get ready.

693
00:52:29,746 --> 00:52:33,739
- Hey, Landon, I want you to win.
- You want me to do what?

694
00:52:34,985 --> 00:52:36,953
You'd like me to do what, Mr. Holland?

695
00:52:36,987 --> 00:52:38,284
I want you to win.

696
00:52:38,322 --> 00:52:40,847
Of course, man.
It's me, the Popoff.

697
00:52:40,891 --> 00:52:43,519
- It's Ringo. I'm gonna own him.
- You're gonna own him? Okay.

698
00:52:43,560 --> 00:52:46,529
I know your style and I like your style.

699
00:52:46,563 --> 00:52:50,124
Matter of fact, the MCW needs
more fighters like you.

700
00:52:50,167 --> 00:52:54,001
- A good bad guy's hard to find.
- Cool.

701
00:52:54,037 --> 00:52:55,595
And because I like your style,

702
00:52:55,639 --> 00:52:57,607
the referee might not
be able to see everything

703
00:52:57,641 --> 00:52:59,370
that happens in the ring today.

704
00:52:59,409 --> 00:53:01,934
- Is he blind?
- Sorry, Mr. Holland.

705
00:53:01,979 --> 00:53:03,446
No, it's all right.

706
00:53:03,480 --> 00:53:05,505
Nah, he ain't blind.
He's with us.

707
00:53:07,517 --> 00:53:09,417
- See what I'm saying?
- I see.

708
00:53:13,991 --> 00:53:17,290
I want a good show,
but I want you to win.

709
00:53:17,327 --> 00:53:20,319
All right?
Let's do it, baby.

710
00:53:27,504 --> 00:53:29,404
- You ready for this, champ?
- Yes, sir.

711
00:53:29,439 --> 00:53:31,873
Ladies and gentlemen,

712
00:53:31,908 --> 00:53:34,376
welcome to the MCW Arena...

713
00:53:34,411 --> 00:53:37,642
Thank you for being here with me.

714
00:53:37,681 --> 00:53:40,411
I wouldn't want it any other way.

715
00:53:40,450 --> 00:53:43,214
And now here comes

716
00:53:43,253 --> 00:53:46,120
Ringo Duran.

717
00:53:46,156 --> 00:53:47,214
Jesus, Ringo.

718
00:53:54,798 --> 00:53:57,528
Now I know we're in the big time.
Good to see you.

719
00:54:02,072 --> 00:54:04,870
Welcome back to the MCW 100:
The Undiscovered.

720
00:54:04,908 --> 00:54:07,968
Now we are on match two
today after Alonso Scott

721
00:54:08,011 --> 00:54:10,741
completely obliterated
Seville "Fingers" Duarte

722
00:54:10,781 --> 00:54:13,750
earlier this afternoon
in just 11 seconds.

723
00:54:13,784 --> 00:54:15,445
He certainly blew his load early.

724
00:54:15,485 --> 00:54:18,147
But all eyes are on this bout
between Landon "The Brother" Popoff

725
00:54:18,188 --> 00:54:19,348
and...

726
00:54:19,389 --> 00:54:20,981
Who's this?

727
00:54:21,024 --> 00:54:22,150
Ringo Duran.

728
00:54:22,192 --> 00:54:24,251
Who-- who is that?

729
00:54:24,294 --> 00:54:27,229
And just like the sweater
he's wearing, I'm sure Ringo...

730
00:54:33,470 --> 00:54:35,961
Okay, gloves.

731
00:54:36,006 --> 00:54:38,201
- You're good.
- Making his way to the referee...

732
00:54:38,241 --> 00:54:39,333
All right, have a good fight.

733
00:54:39,376 --> 00:54:42,402
...is the deadlier, dirtier half
of the Popoff brothers...

734
00:54:42,446 --> 00:54:45,904
- Hey, big man.
-...Landon "The Brother" Popoff.

735
00:54:45,949 --> 00:54:48,577
Get your fighter in here.

736
00:54:48,618 --> 00:54:50,609
Big man, how are you?

737
00:55:01,031 --> 00:55:02,658
Hey, Ringo.

738
00:55:02,699 --> 00:55:05,725
Don't pay any attention
to all this garbage, all this shit.

739
00:55:05,769 --> 00:55:08,237
- Remember what we talked about?
- Yeah.

740
00:55:08,271 --> 00:55:11,001
What did we talk about?
Win the crowd--

741
00:55:11,041 --> 00:55:13,339
- Win the fight.
- That's right, that's right.

742
00:55:15,078 --> 00:55:17,410
All right.

743
00:55:17,447 --> 00:55:19,745
Good, you're good.
Gloves.

744
00:55:23,186 --> 00:55:25,313
We good?

745
00:55:25,355 --> 00:55:28,882
Yeah yeah, you're good.

746
00:55:28,925 --> 00:55:31,393
Good luck.

747
00:55:38,034 --> 00:55:40,002
- How you feel, champ?
- Great.

748
00:55:40,036 --> 00:55:42,368
Okay.

749
00:55:42,405 --> 00:55:45,499
Fighters.

750
00:55:45,542 --> 00:55:48,875
Okay, gentlemen, I want it hard
but I want it clean.

751
00:55:48,912 --> 00:55:51,540
No gouging, no fouls, all right?

752
00:55:51,581 --> 00:55:54,049
Let's put on a good show.
Touch gloves.

753
00:56:01,424 --> 00:56:03,119
It's a packed house tonight.

754
00:56:03,160 --> 00:56:04,354
- Packed.
- Very nice.

755
00:56:04,394 --> 00:56:06,589
- Come on, Ringo.
- Right out of the gate, Ringo.

756
00:56:06,630 --> 00:56:09,428
Let's go, let's go.
Let's get a lid on him.

757
00:56:12,369 --> 00:56:14,894
Fight.

758
00:56:19,743 --> 00:56:20,835
Yes, yeah!

759
00:56:27,017 --> 00:56:28,917
I'm lovin' this!
I'm lovin' this!

760
00:56:28,952 --> 00:56:30,283
Just hit him back.

761
00:56:30,320 --> 00:56:32,049
Wow, we are seeing
something totally different

762
00:56:32,088 --> 00:56:34,750
right from the start from Ringo Duran.

763
00:56:34,791 --> 00:56:36,884
Thanks for stating the obvious, Emily.

764
00:56:36,927 --> 00:56:39,054
Float like a sledgehammer,
sting like a dump truck--

765
00:56:39,095 --> 00:56:42,087
no graceful dekes from Ringo
as he comes firing out from the gates.

766
00:56:46,136 --> 00:56:48,502
I don't see a gimpy arm, man.

767
00:56:48,538 --> 00:56:50,563
I do not see a gimpy arm.

768
00:56:54,277 --> 00:56:55,266
Yeah!

769
00:56:58,248 --> 00:56:59,943
Yes!

770
00:57:02,152 --> 00:57:03,779
I've never seen a crowd
love him so much.

771
00:57:03,820 --> 00:57:04,809
Neither has he.

772
00:57:04,854 --> 00:57:07,721
I hope it's something
he plans on getting used to.

773
00:57:12,462 --> 00:57:14,020
Way to go, Ringo!

774
00:57:25,242 --> 00:57:27,142
Beautiful!

775
00:57:28,144 --> 00:57:29,611
Yeah!

776
00:57:33,617 --> 00:57:35,710
- Something like that?
- Something like that.

777
00:57:35,752 --> 00:57:37,219
- Shit, I'll say.
- Just shut up.

778
00:57:37,254 --> 00:57:39,051
Don't get all cocky on me here now.

779
00:57:39,089 --> 00:57:41,284
All you've really done
is just piss this kid off,

780
00:57:41,324 --> 00:57:43,087
so keep your left up,
protect yourself.

781
00:57:43,126 --> 00:57:45,287
Are you listening to me?

782
00:57:45,328 --> 00:57:47,159
All right, how's the arm feel?

783
00:57:47,197 --> 00:57:49,256
Like $100,000.

784
00:57:49,299 --> 00:57:51,062
See, getting cocky.
Don't do that.

785
00:57:51,101 --> 00:57:52,625
The gloves-- use them.

786
00:57:52,669 --> 00:57:54,762
I didn't expect him
to come at me so hard.

787
00:57:54,804 --> 00:57:56,965
He's supposed to be an old man.

788
00:57:57,007 --> 00:57:59,976
He ain't nothing.
He ain't nothing.

789
00:58:06,983 --> 00:58:09,178
Go in there and finish this off.

790
00:58:13,089 --> 00:58:15,080
Fight!

791
00:58:23,566 --> 00:58:26,034
Get up, get up!
Come on, man!

792
00:58:38,214 --> 00:58:41,342
Yeah, your guy is going down.

793
00:58:41,384 --> 00:58:43,352
And with just one swing
of that mighty fist,

794
00:58:43,386 --> 00:58:45,581
The Brute has tipped over
the Tower of Ringo.

795
00:58:45,622 --> 00:58:47,954
Metaphor isn't your strong spot, Emily.

796
00:58:47,991 --> 00:58:49,856
- Come on, man.
- Ringo, get up.

797
00:58:49,893 --> 00:58:52,293
- No!
- We're gonna have to stop.

798
00:58:52,329 --> 00:58:54,854
He's got something in his gloves.

799
00:58:54,898 --> 00:58:57,560
- Gotta fight back, son.
- Hit him!

800
00:59:00,470 --> 00:59:03,200
- What the hell's he doing?
- Losing.

801
00:59:03,239 --> 00:59:05,002
Let's see you fight.

802
00:59:05,041 --> 00:59:07,635
If I don't see you fight,
I gotta deduct a point.

803
00:59:12,315 --> 00:59:14,715
Hey, stop.
Blue corner.

804
00:59:14,751 --> 00:59:17,652
- One point.
- What the fuck, ref? What the fuck?

805
00:59:17,687 --> 00:59:19,678
- Fight!
- God damn it.

806
00:59:33,136 --> 00:59:36,071
- Oh, shit!
- You got him, you got him!

807
00:59:36,106 --> 00:59:37,334
It's over!

808
00:59:37,374 --> 00:59:40,002
- Yes!
- Yeah!

809
00:59:41,544 --> 00:59:42,772
No no no.

810
00:59:46,883 --> 00:59:49,909
Three punches with the other guy's fist.

811
00:59:49,953 --> 00:59:52,979
- The other guy's fist!
- S-stop.

812
01:00:00,196 --> 01:00:03,131
Okay, winner by knockout:

813
01:00:03,166 --> 01:00:05,430
Ringo Duran.

814
01:00:08,938 --> 01:00:10,303
Ringo!

815
01:00:14,210 --> 01:00:18,476
Ringo Duran!

816
01:00:22,719 --> 01:00:24,744
I don't fuckin' believe it.

817
01:00:24,788 --> 01:00:27,256
I don't fuckin' believe it.

818
01:00:36,266 --> 01:00:40,066
Hello, this is Sergio Ponzo.

819
01:00:40,103 --> 01:00:42,799
Do you remember me?

820
01:00:42,839 --> 01:00:44,568
Good good.

821
01:00:44,607 --> 01:00:47,542
I'd like to meet with you.
I have a proposition for you.

822
01:00:54,117 --> 01:00:56,176
Hey, Mr. Holland.

823
01:00:56,219 --> 01:00:58,779
God damn it, Alonso.
You scared the shit out of me.

824
01:00:58,822 --> 01:01:00,790
Listen, I got a lot of shit going on.

825
01:01:00,824 --> 01:01:03,019
Why'd you want to meet anyways?

826
01:01:03,059 --> 01:01:06,256
I wanted to meet because
you don't answer my phone calls.

827
01:01:06,296 --> 01:01:08,662
We had an arrangement, Christopher.

828
01:01:08,698 --> 01:01:10,393
What the fuck happened?

829
01:01:10,433 --> 01:01:12,833
First of all, you got
a lot of goddamn nerve

830
01:01:12,869 --> 01:01:13,927
breaking into my office.

831
01:01:13,970 --> 01:01:16,598
- What are you, a fucking idiot?
- I didn't guarantee you shit.

832
01:01:16,639 --> 01:01:18,800
You didn't guarantee me shit?

833
01:01:18,842 --> 01:01:20,810
You told me Ringo was gonna fall.

834
01:01:20,844 --> 01:01:23,506
I bet $100,000 of my own money

835
01:01:23,546 --> 01:01:25,309
on a 25:1 shot.

836
01:01:25,348 --> 01:01:27,612
You understand that?

837
01:01:27,650 --> 01:01:29,618
Now luckily for you
I've figured out a way

838
01:01:29,652 --> 01:01:31,119
that you could be a little more

839
01:01:31,154 --> 01:01:33,019
personally invested in the next match.

840
01:01:33,056 --> 01:01:35,251
- I've done all I can do.
- Really? You did all you can do?

841
01:01:35,291 --> 01:01:36,280
That's all you can do?

842
01:01:36,326 --> 01:01:38,351
I don't like getting backed
into corners.

843
01:01:38,394 --> 01:01:40,919
When you're my fuckin' dog,
I'll back you in any corner I want to.

844
01:01:40,964 --> 01:01:43,159
- You know what? This is some bullshit!
- Bullshit?

845
01:02:12,061 --> 01:02:13,392
Enough enough!

846
01:02:13,429 --> 01:02:15,761
- I'll snap his neck right now.
- Yeah? I don't think so.

847
01:02:15,798 --> 01:02:18,198
Because when your brains
are splattered on the wall,

848
01:02:18,234 --> 01:02:20,498
you might lose a little coordination

849
01:02:20,537 --> 01:02:22,562
and that's a Jersey promise.

850
01:02:25,208 --> 01:02:27,267
Fuck.

851
01:02:27,310 --> 01:02:29,005
Now this is how it's gonna go down.

852
01:02:29,045 --> 01:02:32,606
They are going to fight
and you are going to make

853
01:02:32,649 --> 01:02:35,083
a bet with your own money for me.

854
01:02:35,118 --> 01:02:36,949
And our man Alonso here is gonna make it

855
01:02:36,986 --> 01:02:40,251
a sure thing because
he will take the fall.

856
01:02:40,290 --> 01:02:42,417
You got it?

857
01:02:42,458 --> 01:02:44,551
And you are my dog now too.

858
01:03:46,122 --> 01:03:48,249
So here's the deal.

859
01:03:48,291 --> 01:03:52,193
You take the fall, a full knockout
in the second round.

860
01:03:52,228 --> 01:03:54,321
Anything before that
will seem suspicious.

861
01:03:54,364 --> 01:03:58,664
But it absolutely can't be
after the second round.

862
01:03:58,701 --> 01:04:01,295
- You got it?
- This is messed up, man.

863
01:04:01,337 --> 01:04:04,829
No no, Alonso, this isn't messed up.

864
01:04:04,874 --> 01:04:08,139
This is business.

865
01:05:15,978 --> 01:05:17,969
Now this one right here...

866
01:05:18,014 --> 01:05:20,881
You're gonna bet
this horse is really hard.

867
01:05:20,917 --> 01:05:22,350
I think he might be a pink.

868
01:05:22,385 --> 01:05:23,682
Pink is the name of the jockey?

869
01:05:23,720 --> 01:05:25,688
No, pink bays.
Pink.

870
01:05:25,722 --> 01:05:27,519
- How you doing, champ?
- Doing great.

871
01:05:27,557 --> 01:05:29,923
- What about the arm?
- Arm's great.

872
01:05:29,959 --> 01:05:31,927
- Great?
- Kara done wonders.

873
01:05:31,961 --> 01:05:33,428
- You did?
- Yeah, I did.

874
01:05:33,463 --> 01:05:35,693
I'm getting a little worried
about the head right now,

875
01:05:35,732 --> 01:05:37,359
that it's gonna split open
on you again.

876
01:05:37,400 --> 01:05:38,560
It'll be fine.

877
01:05:38,601 --> 01:05:40,228
If it bleeds,
they're gonna stop the fight.

878
01:05:40,269 --> 01:05:42,328
- It's not going to bleed.
- If it does bleed--

879
01:05:42,371 --> 01:05:44,305
this is what they're looking for.

880
01:05:44,340 --> 01:05:46,433
Could you relax?
It's just another fight.

881
01:05:46,476 --> 01:05:49,934
Hey, the MCW marketing people
just sent this down.

882
01:05:49,979 --> 01:05:51,947
The hell it's just another fight.

883
01:05:51,981 --> 01:05:53,812
I'm fine with the one I got, okay?

884
01:05:53,850 --> 01:05:55,477
What about the t-shirts and mugs?

885
01:05:55,518 --> 01:05:57,076
- Mugs?
- Yeah.

886
01:05:57,120 --> 01:05:59,645
- Hi.
- Just give us a second here.

887
01:05:59,689 --> 01:06:02,123
Thank you very much, kids.
You gotta start focusing here.

888
01:06:02,158 --> 01:06:04,285
We're about to go
into a major fight with this guy.

889
01:06:04,327 --> 01:06:07,785
The guy's gonna try and end this one
really early, all right?

890
01:06:07,830 --> 01:06:11,061
He's very predictable, but he's gonna
come with that left kick, left kick--

891
01:06:11,100 --> 01:06:12,965
- Right hook.
- That's right, that's right.

892
01:06:13,002 --> 01:06:15,835
The left kick, the left kick,
the right cross.

893
01:06:15,872 --> 01:06:18,773
- You gotta be ready for that right.
- Got it.

894
01:06:18,808 --> 01:06:22,801
17 knockouts in 11 seconds or less.

895
01:06:22,845 --> 01:06:24,642
That's 11 seconds.

896
01:06:24,680 --> 01:06:26,705
He's never seen a fight
go longer than two minutes.

897
01:06:26,749 --> 01:06:30,241
This guy's got 25 amateur belts
for Christ's sakes.

898
01:06:30,286 --> 01:06:33,221
Relax, I've read
"Sports Illustrated" too.

899
01:06:33,256 --> 01:06:35,224
Well, okay, relax is not the point here.

900
01:06:35,258 --> 01:06:37,283
I'm just trying to say
he's the golden boy.

901
01:06:37,326 --> 01:06:39,351
He's a lottery ticket winner.

902
01:06:39,395 --> 01:06:41,522
The pressure's on him,
it's not on you.

903
01:06:41,564 --> 01:06:44,533
He couldn't grind it out out there
if you were to give him coffee beans.

904
01:06:44,567 --> 01:06:47,502
He can't outlast you.
That's how we're gonna win this.

905
01:06:47,537 --> 01:06:50,870
If he does connect with that right hand,
you're gonna have to suffer through it.

906
01:06:50,907 --> 01:06:53,171
- Are you with me on this?
- I'm ready.

907
01:06:53,209 --> 01:06:55,769
- Are you mad at me?
- Not now.

908
01:06:55,812 --> 01:06:59,111
All right.
I want you mad at Alonso.

909
01:06:59,148 --> 01:07:02,447
- I am. Now let's go.
- All right, you ready?

910
01:07:26,475 --> 01:07:28,340
Come on, fight!

911
01:07:28,377 --> 01:07:30,937
Come on, you're kidding.
What the fuck is Alonso doing?

912
01:07:35,818 --> 01:07:37,547
Yes!

913
01:07:37,587 --> 01:07:39,953
- Fight!
- Worry about yourself, old man.

914
01:07:43,759 --> 01:07:45,886
- This is bullshit.
- Come on.

915
01:07:59,141 --> 01:08:01,234
I'll give you two seconds
to break this off

916
01:08:01,277 --> 01:08:03,074
or I'm going to fuck you up.

917
01:08:03,112 --> 01:08:05,774
What's going on?
Let's finish this fight up.

918
01:08:15,124 --> 01:08:16,819
- What's going on?
- I don't know.

919
01:08:16,859 --> 01:08:19,123
- Did they work something out here?
- I don't know.

920
01:08:19,161 --> 01:08:22,221
Well, it seems Ringo has completely
given up on Alonso.

921
01:08:22,265 --> 01:08:24,961
Actually, Emily, I think it might be
the other way around.

922
01:08:35,411 --> 01:08:37,174
Take him, Ringo!
Take him out right now!

923
01:08:37,213 --> 01:08:39,181
Come on, this is bullshit.

924
01:08:39,215 --> 01:08:41,308
That's the round.
That's the round.

925
01:08:46,989 --> 01:08:48,957
What the hell are you guys
doing in here, huh?

926
01:08:48,991 --> 01:08:50,720
What, are you ballroom dancing?

927
01:08:50,760 --> 01:08:53,490
I wait and wait and wait
and he doesn't throw one punch.

928
01:08:53,529 --> 01:08:55,793
If he doesn't want the match
and he's throwing you the match,

929
01:08:55,831 --> 01:08:57,162
then take it.

930
01:08:57,199 --> 01:08:59,064
Knock this guy out
if that's what he wants.

931
01:08:59,101 --> 01:09:01,467
- Not without a fight.
- What is wrong with this man?

932
01:09:01,504 --> 01:09:04,564
He won't do it.
He only knows one way to fight.

933
01:09:04,607 --> 01:09:07,269
- All right, let's go.
- Take him out right now. End it.

934
01:09:09,545 --> 01:09:10,842
All right, let's go.
End it.

935
01:09:10,880 --> 01:09:13,178
Come on, right now.
Let's end this one.

936
01:09:21,657 --> 01:09:23,989
Fight!

937
01:09:24,026 --> 01:09:25,994
You're making a fool out of yourself.

938
01:09:26,028 --> 01:09:28,087
You do what you do, I do what I do.

939
01:09:28,130 --> 01:09:30,291
Don't disrespect the cage, man.

940
01:09:30,333 --> 01:09:31,857
Hit me, old man.

941
01:09:40,476 --> 01:09:42,034
Yeah!

942
01:09:46,015 --> 01:09:47,812
How much?
How much for selling out?

943
01:09:47,850 --> 01:09:49,647
- Fuck you, man!
- There you go.

944
01:09:49,685 --> 01:09:52,313
There you go.
Finish him!

945
01:09:52,355 --> 01:09:55,324
- Come on, you just gonna give up?
- This is not Alonso Scott.

946
01:09:55,358 --> 01:09:57,826
I don't know who this fucking guy is.
He's not Alonso Scott.

947
01:09:57,860 --> 01:10:00,420
It's Alonso Scott tonight.

948
01:10:00,463 --> 01:10:03,364
- Come on, fight!
- Fuck it.

949
01:10:17,046 --> 01:10:19,674
There you go.
Now we got a fight.

950
01:10:21,584 --> 01:10:24,280
Wait for it.

951
01:10:24,320 --> 01:10:26,447
Wait for it.

952
01:10:26,489 --> 01:10:28,480
And Alonso is back on the offensive.

953
01:10:28,524 --> 01:10:30,048
Now 20 seconds can be a long time.

954
01:10:30,092 --> 01:10:32,026
That's what I told your sister.

955
01:10:37,533 --> 01:10:39,763
You a Duran fan now, Christopher?

956
01:10:43,339 --> 01:10:45,170
Yes yes!

957
01:10:47,843 --> 01:10:49,435
Take him out right now!

958
01:10:55,985 --> 01:10:57,680
That's more like it.
Come on.

959
01:10:57,720 --> 01:10:59,517
What the hell are you fighting for?

960
01:10:59,555 --> 01:11:02,080
That's it.
That's the round.

961
01:11:04,427 --> 01:11:06,691
- Here you go. All right, champ.
- Have a little water.

962
01:11:06,729 --> 01:11:08,720
You're way ahead in this fight.

963
01:11:08,764 --> 01:11:11,756
So if he mounts you,
I want you to turn away.

964
01:11:11,801 --> 01:11:13,996
Full guard, all right.
That's a necessity.

965
01:11:14,036 --> 01:11:16,095
We don't want that cut opening up again.

966
01:11:16,138 --> 01:11:18,504
I don't wanna lose this fight
on a goddamn technicality.

967
01:11:18,541 --> 01:11:20,304
Remember, watch out
for the left kick, left kick,

968
01:11:20,342 --> 01:11:22,003
- and you watch for...
- Right hook.

969
01:11:22,044 --> 01:11:24,103
That's right.
Left kick, left kick...

970
01:11:24,146 --> 01:11:25,613
- Right hook!
- Okay, you're ready.

971
01:11:25,648 --> 01:11:29,084
Hey, fighters, let's go.
Corners out.

972
01:11:31,720 --> 01:11:33,688
Fight!

973
01:11:54,910 --> 01:11:56,377
Good hit!

974
01:12:11,127 --> 01:12:13,095
- You're bleeding.
- This ain't bleeding.

975
01:12:13,129 --> 01:12:15,689
He's not bleeding.
He's fine. Let him go.

976
01:12:34,783 --> 01:12:37,183
It's over, it's over.

977
01:12:41,857 --> 01:12:43,415
Oh, yes!

978
01:12:47,229 --> 01:12:49,823
That's it, that's it.

979
01:12:49,865 --> 01:12:50,889
That's it, that's it.

980
01:12:50,933 --> 01:12:53,333
I didn't throw it, man.
I didn't throw it.

981
01:12:53,369 --> 01:12:55,337
Good fight.

982
01:13:09,285 --> 01:13:10,718
Anything you wanna tell me, Pressure?

983
01:13:18,427 --> 01:13:22,158
Winner by judges' split decision:

984
01:13:22,198 --> 01:13:24,393
Ringo Duran.

985
01:13:33,943 --> 01:13:35,410
Way to go, Ringo!

986
01:13:56,098 --> 01:13:58,191
Look, he's not talking
to anyone right now, okay?

987
01:13:58,234 --> 01:14:00,099
No pictures.
No-- I'm not talking--

988
01:14:00,135 --> 01:14:01,796
Raphael, they really want interviews.

989
01:14:01,837 --> 01:14:03,805
Well, let me ask him.

990
01:14:03,839 --> 01:14:05,864
No, he's not really talking right now.

991
01:14:05,908 --> 01:14:08,433
No, he's not really talking right now.

992
01:14:08,477 --> 01:14:11,776
No picture-- my sign?
Well, I'm a Leo.

993
01:14:11,814 --> 01:14:14,009
Yeah, I don't know yet.

994
01:14:14,049 --> 01:14:16,040
Why? Why?

995
01:14:16,085 --> 01:14:17,712
Because the fucking fight just ended.

996
01:14:17,753 --> 01:14:20,779
The blood's not even dry yet.
It's "The Patriot" now.

997
01:14:20,823 --> 01:14:22,791
Everybody wants to know how you feel

998
01:14:22,825 --> 01:14:24,816
about fighting Duran
in a championship bout.

999
01:14:26,195 --> 01:14:28,254
You tell the press

1000
01:14:28,297 --> 01:14:33,166
I'm gonna rip fucking
Ringo Duran's head off!

1001
01:14:35,037 --> 01:14:37,267
Yeah, Christopher "The Pressure" Holland

1002
01:14:37,306 --> 01:14:39,672
is absolutely looking forward
to fighting Mr. Duran

1003
01:14:39,708 --> 01:14:41,676
for the championship title.

1004
01:14:41,710 --> 01:14:43,701
Mm-hmm.
Yeah, direct quote.

1005
01:14:47,883 --> 01:14:50,477
We got our blockbuster, my friend.

1006
01:14:50,519 --> 01:14:53,283
We got our blockbuster.

1007
01:15:01,730 --> 01:15:04,358
Want a nut?

1008
01:15:04,400 --> 01:15:06,800
No, thank you.
I don't want any nuts.

1009
01:15:06,835 --> 01:15:09,736
Suit yourself.

1010
01:15:39,768 --> 01:15:41,668
Fuck off.

1011
01:15:41,704 --> 01:15:43,399
Hey, Alonso, that was
a great match last night.

1012
01:15:43,439 --> 01:15:45,407
Saw it on Pay-Per-View.
It was really exciting.

1013
01:15:45,441 --> 01:15:47,602
- Well, the crowd seemed to like it.
- They liked it?

1014
01:15:47,643 --> 01:15:49,474
The crowd?

1015
01:15:51,113 --> 01:15:53,673
Yeah, you liked it, huh?
You son of a bitch!

1016
01:15:53,716 --> 01:15:55,547
You son of a bitch!

1017
01:15:58,487 --> 01:16:02,048
Do you know how much
fucking money you cost me,

1018
01:16:02,091 --> 01:16:04,389
you son of a--

1019
01:16:08,864 --> 01:16:11,924
Come on, man,
you don't gotta do this.

1020
01:16:11,967 --> 01:16:14,026
You don't-- you don't
gotta do this, man.

1021
01:16:14,069 --> 01:16:16,435
- Stop!
- Stop? Stop?

1022
01:16:16,472 --> 01:16:18,440
I thought you already made
your decision.

1023
01:16:18,474 --> 01:16:21,102
- You don't wanna live, right?
- Yeah, I wanna live.

1024
01:16:21,143 --> 01:16:23,168
- You wanna live?
- I just can't take a dive, man.

1025
01:16:23,212 --> 01:16:26,579
Can't take a fall?
Bang!

1026
01:16:26,615 --> 01:16:27,980
Son of a bitch.

1027
01:16:28,016 --> 01:16:30,211
You know how much money
you cost me?

1028
01:16:30,252 --> 01:16:34,348
You're lucky that you can
still be useful to me, yes?

1029
01:16:34,390 --> 01:16:36,824
- Yeah, I can be useful.
- Good.

1030
01:16:36,859 --> 01:16:38,793
Christopher here is gonna finish

1031
01:16:38,827 --> 01:16:41,762
what you started two weeks ago.

1032
01:16:41,797 --> 01:16:46,097
Now you-- you are going
to guarantee us

1033
01:16:46,135 --> 01:16:48,194
the outcome of that fight

1034
01:16:48,237 --> 01:16:50,535
or you're not gonna live
to see the first round.

1035
01:16:50,572 --> 01:16:52,369
I ain't gonna kill anybody, man.

1036
01:16:52,408 --> 01:16:56,310
Alonso, don't you know
you don't have to kill a man

1037
01:16:56,345 --> 01:16:58,336
to kill him?

1038
01:17:01,350 --> 01:17:04,581
- Hello, Razer.
- Aw, shit.

1039
01:17:04,620 --> 01:17:08,351
What's wrong with you fucking guys?

1040
01:17:12,561 --> 01:17:15,530
- How are things with Pepper?
- Amazing.

1041
01:17:15,564 --> 01:17:17,623
Can you believe a girl like her
with a guy like me?

1042
01:17:17,666 --> 01:17:18,860
Yes, I can.

1043
01:17:18,901 --> 01:17:21,961
Sometimes, Ringo, you throw shit
out to the universe

1044
01:17:22,004 --> 01:17:24,370
and it comes back as sirloin.

1045
01:17:24,406 --> 01:17:26,806
- She's still teaching you poetry?
- Yep.

1046
01:17:26,842 --> 01:17:29,276
But I don't get half of what
she's saying most of the time.

1047
01:17:29,311 --> 01:17:31,677
- Does it bother you?
- No, not at all.

1048
01:17:31,713 --> 01:17:33,908
Makes me want to become better.

1049
01:17:47,362 --> 01:17:49,694
Run!

1050
01:18:48,991 --> 01:18:50,982
Alonso!

1051
01:18:59,601 --> 01:19:01,592
Come on, run.

1052
01:19:05,173 --> 01:19:07,164
Run!

1053
01:19:19,955 --> 01:19:21,684
Link!

1054
01:19:29,164 --> 01:19:30,961
Link, you okay?

1055
01:19:35,671 --> 01:19:37,969
- Is that kid dead?
- It was a fucking accident, man.

1056
01:19:38,006 --> 01:19:40,941
Let's get the hell out of here.
Come on.

1057
01:19:50,085 --> 01:19:52,076
Are you okay?

1058
01:19:54,389 --> 01:19:57,620
Are you okay?

1059
01:20:25,721 --> 01:20:28,383
He should still be in for observation.

1060
01:20:28,423 --> 01:20:30,687
The kid has no insurance.

1061
01:20:30,726 --> 01:20:33,718
They said the best place
for him would be in bed.

1062
01:20:33,762 --> 01:20:35,730
He's gonna be okay.

1063
01:20:35,764 --> 01:20:38,756
I saw him get hit.
He's just a little guy.

1064
01:20:38,800 --> 01:20:40,893
Is he okay?

1065
01:20:40,936 --> 01:20:43,404
Where is he?
Where is he?

1066
01:20:43,438 --> 01:20:46,236
- Pepper, he's sleeping.
- Kara, where is he?

1067
01:20:46,274 --> 01:20:49,300
- What the hell happened to your arm?
- Arm is fine.

1068
01:20:49,344 --> 01:20:51,175
I just got him.

1069
01:20:51,213 --> 01:20:53,545
I just got him.

1070
01:20:53,582 --> 01:20:56,415
He just found me.

1071
01:21:08,397 --> 01:21:12,356
Got yourself a nice new couch.
It's nice.

1072
01:21:14,403 --> 01:21:16,371
- What?
- This never would have happened

1073
01:21:16,405 --> 01:21:18,896
if I didn't let him hang around
with me so much.

1074
01:21:18,940 --> 01:21:20,532
You think not?

1075
01:21:20,575 --> 01:21:22,566
Well, what about
what you've done for him?

1076
01:21:22,611 --> 01:21:25,205
I mean a kid like this
with no real physical ability,

1077
01:21:25,247 --> 01:21:26,874
no real kind of coordination--

1078
01:21:26,915 --> 01:21:29,440
to experience the things that he has...

1079
01:21:29,484 --> 01:21:32,544
- The kid idolizes you, man.
- Yeah, he picked the wrong idol.

1080
01:21:34,156 --> 01:21:35,350
I don't know.

1081
01:21:35,390 --> 01:21:37,620
No one ever forced this kid
to be in your corner.

1082
01:21:37,659 --> 01:21:39,388
He just showed up every day,

1083
01:21:39,428 --> 01:21:41,589
day after day, all on his own.

1084
01:21:41,630 --> 01:21:44,121
Yeah, look where that got him.

1085
01:21:45,967 --> 01:21:47,935
Have I ever told you the story

1086
01:21:47,969 --> 01:21:50,494
of what really happened
at your mom's last fight--

1087
01:21:50,539 --> 01:21:54,942
1977 at The Garden
versus Saffire Cassaday?

1088
01:21:54,976 --> 01:21:58,104
- Have l?
- I've read about it.

1089
01:21:58,146 --> 01:21:59,135
Fuck that, man.

1090
01:21:59,181 --> 01:22:01,411
I'm not talking about
a goddamn newspaper account.

1091
01:22:01,450 --> 01:22:03,179
I'm trying to tell you
what really happened.

1092
01:22:03,218 --> 01:22:04,412
I was there.

1093
01:22:04,453 --> 01:22:09,413
I was in the corner
for five merciless rounds.

1094
01:22:09,458 --> 01:22:13,656
Your mom got into that ring
versus Saffire Cassaday,

1095
01:22:13,695 --> 01:22:16,220
she's trading blows
with one of the meanest,

1096
01:22:16,264 --> 01:22:19,631
deadliest competitors
we'd ever come across.

1097
01:22:19,668 --> 01:22:23,399
That Cassaday-Duran fight was touted
as the female David and Goliath,

1098
01:22:23,438 --> 01:22:26,373
except this time your mom
was the one that was 12:1

1099
01:22:26,408 --> 01:22:28,774
and, man, did they ever put on a show.

1100
01:22:30,445 --> 01:22:33,937
But Gracie, she was determined, right?

1101
01:22:33,982 --> 01:22:36,348
I mean the look in her eyes--
wow, locked right in.

1102
01:22:36,384 --> 01:22:38,079
And she was doing all right--

1103
01:22:38,120 --> 01:22:40,145
keeping Saffire back,
keeping her off balance.

1104
01:22:40,188 --> 01:22:43,487
Gracie had that beautiful right kick,
would sweep up out of nowhere.

1105
01:22:43,525 --> 01:22:47,017
But then the third round--
Saffire connected.

1106
01:22:47,062 --> 01:22:49,053
She kicked her leg something fierce.

1107
01:22:51,900 --> 01:22:54,164
Well, I tell you, you could hear
the snap of bone

1108
01:22:54,202 --> 01:22:56,363
clear up into the upper bowl.

1109
01:22:56,404 --> 01:22:59,601
Gracie fell back.

1110
01:22:59,641 --> 01:23:02,405
And by the time the ref
got there to her,

1111
01:23:02,444 --> 01:23:04,344
she was already back up on her feet.

1112
01:23:04,379 --> 01:23:07,542
She was back up on her feet.

1113
01:23:07,582 --> 01:23:10,142
You understand?

1114
01:23:10,185 --> 01:23:13,552
Her leg was shattered, man,
and she's trying to keep

1115
01:23:13,588 --> 01:23:15,488
all of her weight on her right side.

1116
01:23:15,524 --> 01:23:18,982
I mean, imagine what it's like
trying to walk with a broke leg,

1117
01:23:19,027 --> 01:23:20,494
but she's gonna finish it.

1118
01:23:20,529 --> 01:23:22,793
A title fight, okay?
A kickboxing fight.

1119
01:23:22,831 --> 01:23:24,890
Had two more rounds to go.

1120
01:23:24,933 --> 01:23:28,266
And I knew that wasn't
your garden variety,

1121
01:23:28,303 --> 01:23:31,033
average bone-crushing pain
that she was going through.

1122
01:23:31,072 --> 01:23:33,040
With every punch, with every kick--

1123
01:23:33,074 --> 01:23:35,008
and there were a ton of them--

1124
01:23:35,043 --> 01:23:38,809
every strike, your mom was looking

1125
01:23:38,847 --> 01:23:40,838
at the face of God with that pain.

1126
01:23:43,785 --> 01:23:45,878
She was still going through it.

1127
01:23:45,921 --> 01:23:48,856
By the last round, it wasn't pretty.

1128
01:23:48,890 --> 01:23:51,154
She was white,

1129
01:23:51,193 --> 01:23:53,252
she was shaking and sweating,

1130
01:23:53,295 --> 01:23:56,230
and, oh God, my-- my soul
just kind of ripped apart for her.

1131
01:23:56,264 --> 01:23:58,630
So I did it.
I reached for the towel.

1132
01:23:58,667 --> 01:24:02,967
I was gonna like
just throw it into the ring

1133
01:24:03,004 --> 01:24:04,733
and then I caught your mom's eye.

1134
01:24:04,773 --> 01:24:07,708
She's shaking her head at me, no.
"No," she said.

1135
01:24:07,742 --> 01:24:09,710
She's not about to give this one up.

1136
01:24:09,744 --> 01:24:12,508
She's not about
to start quitting, not now.

1137
01:24:12,547 --> 01:24:15,448
I mean after all
she's been through with the leg

1138
01:24:15,483 --> 01:24:18,577
and the rivers of blood and the sweat,

1139
01:24:18,620 --> 01:24:21,020
all the sacrifices that she made.

1140
01:24:21,056 --> 01:24:24,492
She's a mother.
She had you.

1141
01:24:24,526 --> 01:24:29,088
She felt she'd be
throwing all that away.

1142
01:24:29,130 --> 01:24:31,462
So she-- she just took it.

1143
01:24:33,401 --> 01:24:35,426
For two more minutes

1144
01:24:35,470 --> 01:24:39,531
I saw a woman with no legs under her

1145
01:24:39,574 --> 01:24:42,304
stand and take that beating.

1146
01:24:42,344 --> 01:24:45,006
I saw a woman,

1147
01:24:45,046 --> 01:24:48,038
a mother with no strength
left in her arms whatsoever

1148
01:24:48,083 --> 01:24:51,610
and she's punching back.

1149
01:24:51,653 --> 01:24:54,144
I saw a fighter that night in that ring

1150
01:24:54,189 --> 01:24:58,285
and no one's gonna take that
away from her, not never.

1151
01:24:58,326 --> 01:25:01,921
Gracie-- she may not
be around no more,

1152
01:25:03,865 --> 01:25:06,595
but that night, that ain't dead.

1153
01:25:09,905 --> 01:25:12,499
I'm not her.

1154
01:25:12,540 --> 01:25:15,373
What, did you say something?

1155
01:25:15,410 --> 01:25:17,742
I said I'm not her.

1156
01:25:17,779 --> 01:25:20,043
Neither is Link.

1157
01:25:21,449 --> 01:25:23,474
I think you'll find
that there's more of her

1158
01:25:23,518 --> 01:25:26,612
in both of youse than what you think.

1159
01:25:27,956 --> 01:25:30,789
You know, when life
throws this shit to you

1160
01:25:30,825 --> 01:25:34,283
and throws you these kinds of curves,
what else can you do?

1161
01:25:34,329 --> 01:25:37,162
You fight.
You gotta fight.

1162
01:25:44,406 --> 01:25:48,467
- Did I win?
- No.

1163
01:25:48,510 --> 01:25:51,843
Welcome to the MCW 100:
The Undiscovered.

1164
01:25:51,880 --> 01:25:53,814
This is the main title championship

1165
01:25:53,848 --> 01:25:56,408
between the current
reigning champion of the world,

1166
01:25:56,451 --> 01:25:59,716
the undefeated, undisputed
Christopher "The Pressure" Holland,

1167
01:25:59,754 --> 01:26:03,315
and his new contender,
king of the amateurs, Ringo Duran.

1168
01:26:03,358 --> 01:26:05,485
That's what the graphics say, Emily.

1169
01:26:05,527 --> 01:26:07,518
You can read.

1170
01:26:09,364 --> 01:26:13,460
- Big crowd.
- It's a big match.

1171
01:26:13,501 --> 01:26:15,696
Better be Pressure all the way.

1172
01:26:15,737 --> 01:26:18,638
Okay, left arm is set,
but don't block with it.

1173
01:26:18,673 --> 01:26:21,870
It could pop out if Holland
so much as sneezes on it.

1174
01:26:21,910 --> 01:26:24,242
Got it-- crappy arm.

1175
01:26:27,949 --> 01:26:30,349
Well, kid, here we go.
This is it.

1176
01:26:30,385 --> 01:26:32,353
Christopher "The Pressure" Holland.

1177
01:26:32,387 --> 01:26:34,912
Athletic, he's strong,
a submission expert.

1178
01:26:34,956 --> 01:26:37,618
He's gonna come at you,
try to put you on the canvas

1179
01:26:37,659 --> 01:26:39,627
and then beat
the ever-lovin' shit out of you.

1180
01:26:39,661 --> 01:26:42,653
That's not good,
so just don't let him do it.

1181
01:26:42,697 --> 01:26:45,393
- And if I do?
- Well, you're gonna fuckin' lose.

1182
01:26:45,433 --> 01:26:49,096
- Got it. If he beats me, I'm out.
- But no.

1183
01:26:49,137 --> 01:26:50,866
Apparently I've been asking around

1184
01:26:50,905 --> 01:26:53,430
and a little bird tells me
that there's an issue

1185
01:26:53,475 --> 01:26:55,375
with Mr. Holland
in terms of concussions.

1186
01:26:55,410 --> 01:26:58,379
He's had way more--
especially on the left side--

1187
01:26:58,413 --> 01:26:59,880
more than humanly possible.

1188
01:26:59,914 --> 01:27:01,506
Maybe true, maybe not.

1189
01:27:01,549 --> 01:27:03,073
But it's something we can use.

1190
01:27:03,118 --> 01:27:04,585
So keep the fight on its feet,

1191
01:27:04,619 --> 01:27:06,416
see if you can open up
that left side of him.

1192
01:27:06,454 --> 01:27:08,581
Maybe you could land
that sweet right hook of yours

1193
01:27:08,623 --> 01:27:10,716
and then you got a shot for a knockout.

1194
01:27:10,759 --> 01:27:12,727
But otherwise, Ringo,

1195
01:27:12,761 --> 01:27:15,195
I don't give you a prayer
of lasting in there.

1196
01:27:15,230 --> 01:27:17,698
Your confidence is overwhelming.

1197
01:27:17,732 --> 01:27:20,428
Well, welcome to the NBA.

1198
01:27:22,137 --> 01:27:24,571
You'll be all right.

1199
01:27:25,640 --> 01:27:27,130
Tape it.

1200
01:27:28,843 --> 01:27:31,471
Tape what?

1201
01:27:34,516 --> 01:27:38,646
That's nice.
A little extra punch in there.

1202
01:27:38,686 --> 01:27:41,678
Okay, I like it.

1203
01:27:49,931 --> 01:27:53,492
Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to

1204
01:27:53,535 --> 01:27:55,799
the Maximum Cage Warrior main event

1205
01:27:55,837 --> 01:27:59,830
and title match between
Christopher "The Pressure" Holland

1206
01:27:59,874 --> 01:28:04,243
and-- here he is, the newly crowned
king of the amateurs--

1207
01:28:04,279 --> 01:28:08,272
- Ringo Duran!
- Good luck, Ringo.

1208
01:28:16,858 --> 01:28:19,850
Here we go.
Ringo Duran.

1209
01:28:21,362 --> 01:28:23,853
You made it all the way, Ringo.
Good for you.

1210
01:28:23,898 --> 01:28:26,958
No thanks to you.

1211
01:28:27,001 --> 01:28:29,299
- You used to be a fighter, right?
- Yeah.

1212
01:28:29,337 --> 01:28:32,704
- Act like one.
- Good luck.

1213
01:28:42,817 --> 01:28:46,014
And now, making his way
into the arena,

1214
01:28:46,054 --> 01:28:49,615
the reigning undefeated,
undisputed champion,

1215
01:28:49,657 --> 01:28:52,717
the man who put the MCW on the map--

1216
01:28:52,760 --> 01:28:56,924
Christopher "The Pressure" Holland.

1217
01:28:58,266 --> 01:29:00,166
- Come on, champ.
- Yeah.

1218
01:29:00,201 --> 01:29:02,192
Let's lose the robe, please.

1219
01:29:14,048 --> 01:29:18,178
Hey, don't you let 'em in.

1220
01:29:18,219 --> 01:29:20,744
I'm right here, okay?

1221
01:29:20,788 --> 01:29:23,018
I thought you didn't like
the sight of suffering.

1222
01:29:23,057 --> 01:29:24,684
Yeah, I don't, so don't suffer.

1223
01:29:24,726 --> 01:29:26,921
I'll do the best I can.

1224
01:29:32,133 --> 01:29:33,566
Thanks.

1225
01:29:35,937 --> 01:29:37,928
Okay, gentlemen,
this is a championship bout,

1226
01:29:37,972 --> 01:29:40,566
so I'm gonna let you battle some,
but keep it clean.

1227
01:29:40,608 --> 01:29:42,235
Protect yourselves at all times.

1228
01:29:42,277 --> 01:29:44,245
Give the people a show.
Touch gloves.

1229
01:29:52,020 --> 01:29:55,046
Okay, let's go, Ringo.
Let's put him down.

1230
01:29:55,089 --> 01:29:57,216
Fight!

1231
01:30:31,793 --> 01:30:34,193
Shit. Come on, Christopher.

1232
01:30:44,038 --> 01:30:46,006
Yeah!

1233
01:30:47,675 --> 01:30:49,472
Pull it in!

1234
01:31:01,856 --> 01:31:03,050
Corners.

1235
01:31:04,459 --> 01:31:05,892
God!

1236
01:31:26,714 --> 01:31:28,204
Fight!

1237
01:31:38,126 --> 01:31:40,390
Don't trade with him.
Don't trade punches with him.

1238
01:31:56,978 --> 01:31:59,310
How long is this round?
Take him out!

1239
01:32:26,574 --> 01:32:27,871
Fuck!

1240
01:32:35,450 --> 01:32:36,474
Yeah.

1241
01:32:42,457 --> 01:32:45,119
Get up up!
On your feet. On your feet.

1242
01:32:47,729 --> 01:32:49,822
Guard guard guard.
Get out of it.

1243
01:32:49,864 --> 01:32:52,196
- Heads up!
- Look out!

1244
01:32:52,233 --> 01:32:54,428
Turn away!

1245
01:32:56,070 --> 01:32:57,731
Get up up up!
Block!

1246
01:33:28,236 --> 01:33:31,171
Watch the takedown.
Gotta take him fast.

1247
01:33:33,307 --> 01:33:35,502
Okay, let's just finish
this off right now.

1248
01:33:39,113 --> 01:33:40,774
Oh, no, he's on his last legs.

1249
01:33:40,815 --> 01:33:42,680
Let's end this fight right now.

1250
01:33:42,717 --> 01:33:45,686
- Let's go!
- Yeah!

1251
01:33:45,720 --> 01:33:48,484
Man, come on!

1252
01:33:49,690 --> 01:33:52,056
Gentlemen, fight!

1253
01:34:00,835 --> 01:34:03,326
Keep it going, keep it going.

1254
01:34:12,180 --> 01:34:13,977
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

1255
01:34:19,153 --> 01:34:21,519
He's done, ref.
He's done.

1256
01:34:24,525 --> 01:34:27,016
Come on, come on.

1257
01:34:43,945 --> 01:34:45,970
Attaboy!
All right, this is over.

1258
01:34:46,013 --> 01:34:48,573
This is over.
Put him away right now.

1259
01:35:11,572 --> 01:35:14,063
Come on!

1260
01:35:52,747 --> 01:35:55,011
- How you feeling, huh?
- Good.

1261
01:35:55,049 --> 01:35:56,744
You're dropping back
on your right arm, man.

1262
01:35:56,784 --> 01:35:57,842
Why are you dropping back?

1263
01:35:57,885 --> 01:35:59,512
You're dropping back on your right.

1264
01:35:59,554 --> 01:36:01,215
Why are you dropping
back on your right?

1265
01:36:01,255 --> 01:36:02,244
Drink water.

1266
01:36:02,290 --> 01:36:03,917
She's right. Drink it.

1267
01:36:15,002 --> 01:36:16,970
I like the way this is looking,

1268
01:36:17,004 --> 01:36:18,665
but you gotta end it this round

1269
01:36:18,706 --> 01:36:20,640
'cause there ain't gonna
be no other round.

1270
01:36:20,675 --> 01:36:22,438
You hear me on that?

1271
01:36:32,987 --> 01:36:35,080
Fight!

1272
01:36:57,211 --> 01:36:59,202
Watch your range, watch your range.

1273
01:37:02,450 --> 01:37:04,213
Hold on!

1274
01:37:07,989 --> 01:37:10,253
Turn away, Ringo!

1275
01:37:11,692 --> 01:37:14,160
Good.
Come on, hit him!

1276
01:37:21,435 --> 01:37:23,403
Turn away, Ringo!

1277
01:37:25,172 --> 01:37:28,630
Don't tap out.
Don't tap out, man.

1278
01:37:32,079 --> 01:37:33,239
Turn away!

1279
01:37:38,052 --> 01:37:39,679
Break break break.

1280
01:37:53,034 --> 01:37:54,797
It's popped out.

1281
01:37:54,835 --> 01:37:58,999
- It's broken?
- Yes-- no-- I don't know.

1282
01:37:59,040 --> 01:38:00,337
Pop it back.

1283
01:38:00,374 --> 01:38:02,001
No, Ringo.
I'm calling the fight.

1284
01:38:02,043 --> 01:38:04,136
What? Pop it back!

1285
01:38:04,178 --> 01:38:06,942
- You don't have to do this.
- Do it, please.

1286
01:38:41,615 --> 01:38:43,048
Fighters.

1287
01:38:48,823 --> 01:38:50,154
Fight!

1288
01:39:06,741 --> 01:39:10,108
This is over.
Put him down right now!

1289
01:39:19,186 --> 01:39:21,313
Come on, finish him
off already.

1290
01:39:25,626 --> 01:39:27,457
Get out of there, get out of there.

1291
01:39:37,071 --> 01:39:40,302
Go, Ringo, go.

1292
01:40:21,682 --> 01:40:23,445
Yeah!

1293
01:40:33,828 --> 01:40:36,422
Oh, Jesus Christ!

1294
01:40:39,433 --> 01:40:41,458
What the fuck are you laughing at?

1295
01:40:41,502 --> 01:40:43,732
You know, the thing is, Mr. Ponzo,

1296
01:40:43,771 --> 01:40:46,365
you can't fix the game,
the game fixes you.

1297
01:40:47,541 --> 01:40:49,338
Where do you think you're going?

1298
01:40:49,376 --> 01:40:51,571
I'm over it, man.
It's done.

1299
01:40:52,880 --> 01:40:54,905
Fuck this guy.

1300
01:41:00,354 --> 01:41:03,414
Hey, you know, the funny thing
about destiny--

1301
01:41:03,457 --> 01:41:06,426
it has a way of sneaking up behind you
and kicking your ass.

1302
01:41:06,460 --> 01:41:09,452
You do what you do,
I'll do what I do.

1303
01:41:09,496 --> 01:41:11,521
Just get your ass back in that bar.

1304
01:41:11,565 --> 01:41:14,398
You cost me a lot of money.
I will shoot your ass!

1305
01:41:19,440 --> 01:41:21,601
When destiny sneaks up behind you,

1306
01:41:21,642 --> 01:41:23,633
you should hope he doesn't
have his own gun.

1307
01:41:25,446 --> 01:41:27,004
It's over. Go.

1308
01:41:50,671 --> 01:41:53,333
I wish I could be there.

1309
01:41:53,374 --> 01:41:55,365
You are.

1310
01:41:57,278 --> 01:41:59,007
Ladies and gentlemen,

1311
01:41:59,046 --> 01:42:00,775
I would like to introduce to you

1312
01:42:00,814 --> 01:42:03,647
the newest Maximum Cage Warriors

1313
01:42:03,684 --> 01:42:08,644
Professional World Champion...
Ringo Duran!

1314
01:42:39,787 --> 01:42:43,120
I saw a man with no legs

1315
01:42:43,157 --> 01:42:46,251
under him at all stand,

1316
01:42:46,293 --> 01:42:50,491
a guy with no arm punch back.

1317
01:42:51,565 --> 01:42:53,863
I saw a fighter that night--

1318
01:42:53,901 --> 01:42:55,892
the king in his cage.

1319
01:46:45,432 --> 01:46:48,367
Gonna hurt like hell.

1320
01:46:48,402 --> 01:46:50,927
Gonna hurt like hell.

1321
01:46:50,971 --> 01:46:53,098
Gonna hurt like hell.

1322
01:46:56,009 --> 01:46:59,410
Now when you step into that cage,

1323
01:46:59,446 --> 01:47:03,815
the first rule of fighting
is don't get hit.

1324
01:47:03,850 --> 01:47:05,818
Now I told you,

1325
01:47:05,852 --> 01:47:09,151
don't-- don't-- don't get hit.

1326
01:47:09,189 --> 01:47:12,090
You're gonna get hurt.

1327
01:47:12,125 --> 01:47:14,685
The king in his cage.

1328
01:47:14,728 --> 01:47:17,219
Get out of there alive.

1329
01:47:49,429 --> 01:47:52,159
Now when you step into that cage,

1330
01:47:52,199 --> 01:47:55,134
it's gonna hurt like hell.

1331
01:47:55,168 --> 01:47:58,194
Don't get hit.
It's gonna hurt like hell.

1332
01:48:00,240 --> 01:48:02,834
If you break that rule,

1333
01:48:02,876 --> 01:48:05,401
it's gonna hurt like hell.

1334
01:48:05,445 --> 01:48:09,472
Live to win.
It's gonna hurt like hell.

1335
01:48:13,387 --> 01:48:16,447
Oh my God, it looks like
Ringo's shoulder has popped out.

1336
01:48:16,490 --> 01:48:18,458
He must have had a previous injury.

1337
01:48:18,492 --> 01:48:20,551
He'll be fine.
What are you doing later?

1338
01:48:21,595 --> 01:48:22,960
Are you serious right now?

1339
01:48:22,996 --> 01:48:24,122
I've had injuries.

1340
01:48:24,164 --> 01:48:26,462
Are you hitting on me
on national television?

1341
01:48:26,500 --> 01:48:29,992
I wouldn't call it hitting.

1342
01:48:30,037 --> 01:48:32,597
- I can't do this.
- What are you, 5'8"?

1343
01:48:32,639 --> 01:48:34,630
I'm done.

1344
01:48:34,675 --> 01:48:36,643
Train.

1345
01:48:38,679 --> 01:48:39,668
Cut!
