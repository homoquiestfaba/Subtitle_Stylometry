1
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:21,099
Time to get up, man.

2
00:03:22,936 --> 00:03:25,234
-All right, Dad.
-Come on.

3
00:04:33,073 --> 00:04:34,938
Should be here soon.

4
00:05:22,422 --> 00:05:24,583
-I think I should make a list.
-What do mean?

5
00:05:24,791 --> 00:05:27,191
-For your birthday gifts?
-Yeah.

6
00:05:27,394 --> 00:05:29,919
You know you're only getting
a couple of things, right?

7
00:05:30,130 --> 00:05:34,191
Yeah, I know. Just to look at
and study so I can choose better.

8
00:05:34,401 --> 00:05:37,336
Okay, well, that's smart.
Yeah, make a list.

9
00:05:37,837 --> 00:05:39,737
Can you spell everything
you're thinking of?

10
00:05:39,939 --> 00:05:43,534
-I think so.
-All right. That's good.

11
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:50,381
-How you doing in here, man?
-Okay.

12
00:05:57,624 --> 00:06:00,593
Can we go to the park today, after?

13
00:06:01,394 --> 00:06:04,852
No, I gotta go to Oakland.
Well, maybe, we'll see.

14
00:06:05,065 --> 00:06:06,623
Give me a kiss.

15
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:09,400
I'll talk to you later.

16
00:06:12,806 --> 00:06:14,501
Excuse me.

17
00:06:15,275 --> 00:06:17,004
Oh, excuse me...

18
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:19,474
...when is somebody
gonna clean this off?

19
00:06:22,482 --> 00:06:25,042
And the Y?
The Y. We talked about this.

20
00:06:25,251 --> 00:06:28,652
It's an I in "happiness."
There's no Y in "happiness." It's an l.

21
00:06:30,957 --> 00:06:32,822
I'm Chris Gardner.

22
00:06:33,259 --> 00:06:36,353
I met my father for the first time
when I was 28 years old.

23
00:06:37,130 --> 00:06:38,791
And I made up my mind
as a young kid...

24
00:06:38,998 --> 00:06:40,522
...that when I had children...

25
00:06:40,734 --> 00:06:44,067
...my children were gonna know
who their father was.

26
00:06:45,939 --> 00:06:48,703
This is part of my life story.

27
00:06:49,476 --> 00:06:52,877
This part is called "Riding the Bus. "

28
00:06:59,352 --> 00:07:01,013
What's that?

29
00:07:01,621 --> 00:07:03,851
It's a time machine, isn't it?

30
00:07:04,657 --> 00:07:06,249
Seems like a time machine.

31
00:07:06,459 --> 00:07:09,553
That seems like a time machine.
It's a time machine. Take me with you.

32
00:07:09,763 --> 00:07:10,957
This machine...

33
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:12,659
...this machine on my lap--

34
00:07:12,866 --> 00:07:14,834
This guy, he has a time machine.

35
00:07:15,034 --> 00:07:18,094
He travels in the past
with this machine and....

36
00:07:18,304 --> 00:07:20,534
--it is not a time machine.

37
00:07:21,107 --> 00:07:23,701
It's a portable
bone-density scanner.

38
00:07:24,544 --> 00:07:27,172
A medical device I sell for a living.

39
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:29,871
Thank you for the opportunity
to discuss it with you.

40
00:07:30,083 --> 00:07:32,176
-I appreciate it.
-We just don't need it, Chris.

41
00:07:32,385 --> 00:07:34,148
It's unnecessary and expensive.

42
00:07:34,354 --> 00:07:36,481
-Well, maybe next--
-Thank you.

43
00:07:37,557 --> 00:07:42,654
It gave a slightly denser picture
than an x-ray for twice the money.

44
00:07:45,665 --> 00:07:47,257
-Hey.
-Hey, baby.

45
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:49,128
-What happened?
-No, nothing.

46
00:07:49,335 --> 00:07:50,893
Look, I can't get Christopher today.

47
00:07:51,438 --> 00:07:53,633
Oh, no, you don't, Chris.
I'm back on at 7.

48
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,569
I know. I have got to go to Oakland.

49
00:07:56,042 --> 00:07:58,943
So I gotta get Christopher home,
feed him, bathe him...

50
00:07:59,145 --> 00:08:01,739
...get him in bed,
and be back here by 7?

51
00:08:01,948 --> 00:08:04,075
-Yes.
-And we got the tax-bill notice today.

52
00:08:04,284 --> 00:08:07,811
-What are you gonna do about that?
-Look, this is what we gotta do.

53
00:08:12,125 --> 00:08:16,323
You see that car? The one
with the pretty yellow shoe on it?

54
00:08:16,529 --> 00:08:17,894
That's mine.

55
00:08:18,097 --> 00:08:20,065
There's no parking near hospitals.

56
00:08:20,266 --> 00:08:22,757
That's what happens
when you're always in a rush.

57
00:08:22,969 --> 00:08:24,869
Thanks anyway. Very much.

58
00:08:25,071 --> 00:08:28,006
-Maybe next quarter.
-It's possible.

59
00:08:28,875 --> 00:08:34,404
I needed to sell at least two scanners
a month for rent and daycare.

60
00:08:35,281 --> 00:08:36,646
I'd have to sell one more...

61
00:08:36,850 --> 00:08:40,616
...to pay off all of those tickets
under my windshield wiper.

62
00:08:47,427 --> 00:08:49,418
The problem is...

63
00:08:50,330 --> 00:08:52,821
...I haven't sold any for a while.

64
00:08:54,501 --> 00:08:57,197
Since when do you not like
macaroni and cheese?

65
00:08:57,403 --> 00:08:59,928
Since birth?

66
00:09:02,408 --> 00:09:04,433
-What's that?
-What?

67
00:09:04,644 --> 00:09:07,738
-What is this?
-It's a gift for Christopher.

68
00:09:07,947 --> 00:09:10,438
-From who?
-Cynthia from work.

69
00:09:10,650 --> 00:09:13,744
It's for adults. Chris can't use it.
She didn't know.

70
00:09:13,953 --> 00:09:15,944
What are you supposed
to do with it?

71
00:09:16,656 --> 00:09:19,750
Make every side the same color.

72
00:09:21,027 --> 00:09:23,325
Did you pay the taxes?

73
00:09:23,630 --> 00:09:26,758
No, I'm gonna
have to file an extension.

74
00:09:27,534 --> 00:09:31,698
-You already filed an extension.
-Yeah, well, I gotta file another one.

75
00:09:32,071 --> 00:09:35,768
That's-- It's $650.
I'll have it in the next month.

76
00:09:36,276 --> 00:09:38,107
That means interest, right?

77
00:09:38,311 --> 00:09:40,677
-And a penalty?
-Yeah, a little bit.

78
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:46,512
Look, why don't you let me do this?
All right, just relax. Okay?

79
00:09:46,719 --> 00:09:50,883
-Come here. Calm down.
-I have to go back to work.

80
00:09:58,898 --> 00:10:02,527
Let's get ready for bed.
Hey, put your plate in the sink.

81
00:10:03,236 --> 00:10:06,171
A few days ago I was presented
with a report I'd asked for...

82
00:10:06,372 --> 00:10:10,103
...a comprehensive audit, if you will,
of our economic condition.

83
00:10:10,777 --> 00:10:13,507
You won't like it. I didn't like it.

84
00:10:13,713 --> 00:10:15,374
But we have to face the truth...

85
00:10:15,582 --> 00:10:18,210
...and then go to work
to turn things around.

86
00:10:18,418 --> 00:10:22,184
And make no mistake about it,
we can turn them around.

87
00:10:22,388 --> 00:10:25,482
The federal budget is out of control.

88
00:10:25,692 --> 00:10:29,059
And we face runaway deficits
of almost $80 billion...

89
00:10:29,262 --> 00:10:32,698
...for this budget year
that ends September 30th.

90
00:10:32,899 --> 00:10:38,132
That deficit is larger than
the entire federal budget in 1 957.

91
00:10:38,338 --> 00:10:40,898
And so is the almost $80 billion...

92
00:10:41,107 --> 00:10:45,407
... we will pay in interest
this year on the national debt.

93
00:10:46,045 --> 00:10:48,570
Twenty years ago, in 1 960...

94
00:10:48,781 --> 00:10:52,945
...our federal government payroll
was less than $ 1 3 billion.

95
00:10:53,152 --> 00:10:55,848
Today it is 75 billion.

96
00:10:56,055 --> 00:11:01,618
During these 20 years, our population
has only increased by 23. 3 percent....

97
00:11:19,779 --> 00:11:22,543
Man, I got two questions for you:

98
00:11:22,749 --> 00:11:25,877
What do you do?
And how do you do it?

99
00:11:27,387 --> 00:11:30,481
-I'm a stockbroker.
-Stockbroker. Oh, goodness.

100
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:32,658
Had to go to college
to be a stockbroker, huh?

101
00:11:32,925 --> 00:11:36,622
You don't have to. Have to be good
with numbers and good with people.

102
00:11:36,829 --> 00:11:39,229
-That's it.
-Hey, you take care.

103
00:11:39,432 --> 00:11:41,491
I'll let you hang on to my car
for the weekend.

104
00:11:41,701 --> 00:11:44,169
-But I need it back for Monday.
-Feed the meter.

105
00:11:51,344 --> 00:11:53,744
I still remember that moment.

106
00:11:58,017 --> 00:12:02,681
They all looked
so damn happy to me.

107
00:12:09,862 --> 00:12:12,262
Why couldn't I look like that?

108
00:12:29,849 --> 00:12:31,214
I'm gonna try to get home by 6.

109
00:12:31,417 --> 00:12:34,545
I'm gonna stop by a brokerage firm
after work.

110
00:12:34,754 --> 00:12:38,019
-For what?
-I wanna see about a job there.

111
00:12:38,224 --> 00:12:40,852
Yeah? What job?

112
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:43,385
You know, when l--

113
00:12:43,596 --> 00:12:46,224
When I was a kid, I could go through
a math book in a week.

114
00:12:46,432 --> 00:12:49,765
So I'm gonna go see about
what job they got down there.

115
00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:52,804
What job?

116
00:12:55,775 --> 00:12:57,504
Stockbroker.

117
00:12:59,812 --> 00:13:03,009
-Stockbroker?
-Yeah.

118
00:13:03,416 --> 00:13:05,407
Not an astronaut?

119
00:13:22,401 --> 00:13:23,891
Don't talk to me like that, Linda.

120
00:13:25,037 --> 00:13:28,837
I'm gonna go down and see about this,
and I'm gonna do it during the day.

121
00:13:29,041 --> 00:13:30,736
You should probably
do your sales calls.

122
00:13:31,210 --> 00:13:33,644
I don't need you to tell me
about my sales calls, Linda.

123
00:13:33,846 --> 00:13:37,043
I got three of them
before the damn office is even open.

124
00:13:37,583 --> 00:13:40,017
Do you remember
that rent is due next week?

125
00:13:40,219 --> 00:13:42,084
Probably not.

126
00:13:42,722 --> 00:13:44,781
We're already two months behind.

127
00:13:44,991 --> 00:13:48,017
Next week we'll owe three months.

128
00:13:48,494 --> 00:13:52,624
I've been pulling double shifts
for four months now, Chris.

129
00:13:53,032 --> 00:13:57,332
Just sell what's in your contract.
Get us out of that business.

130
00:13:57,537 --> 00:14:01,234
Linda, that is what I am trying to do.

131
00:14:01,974 --> 00:14:04,670
This is what I'm trying to do
for my family...

132
00:14:04,877 --> 00:14:06,242
...for you and for Christopher.

133
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,773
What's the matter with you?

134
00:14:13,953 --> 00:14:15,648
Linda.

135
00:14:16,222 --> 00:14:17,746
Linda.

136
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:49,847
This part of my life
is called "Being Stupid. "

137
00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:53,188
Can I ask you a favor, miss?

138
00:14:53,392 --> 00:14:57,260
Do you mind if I leave this here
with you just for five minutes?

139
00:14:57,463 --> 00:14:59,954
I have a meeting in there
and I don't wanna carry that...

140
00:15:00,166 --> 00:15:02,191
...Iooking smalltime.

141
00:15:03,002 --> 00:15:07,462
Here is a dollar and I'll give you
more money when I come back out.

142
00:15:07,673 --> 00:15:10,938
Okay? It's not valuable.
You can't sell it anywhere.

143
00:15:11,878 --> 00:15:16,042
I can't even sell it, and it's my job.
All right?

144
00:15:23,723 --> 00:15:26,089
-Chris? Tim Brophy, Resources.
-Yes. How are you?

145
00:15:26,292 --> 00:15:27,623
-Come with me.
-Yes, sir.

146
00:15:27,827 --> 00:15:30,591
Let me see if I can find you
an application for our internship.

147
00:15:30,796 --> 00:15:34,027
I'm afraid that's all we can do for you.
See, this is a satellite office.

148
00:15:34,233 --> 00:15:36,895
Jay Twistle in the main office,
he oversees Witter Resources.

149
00:15:37,103 --> 00:15:39,196
I mean, I'm-- You know,
I'm just this office.

150
00:15:39,405 --> 00:15:42,340
As you can see, we got a hell of lot
of applications here, so....

151
00:15:42,541 --> 00:15:45,567
Normally I have a résumé sheet,
but I can't seem to find it anywhere.

152
00:15:45,778 --> 00:15:49,179
-We....
-Thank you very much.

153
00:15:49,382 --> 00:15:50,542
I need to go.

154
00:15:51,150 --> 00:15:52,845
I'll bring this back.

155
00:15:53,085 --> 00:15:56,213
-Thank you.
-Okay.

156
00:16:02,595 --> 00:16:07,089
Trusting a hippie girl with my scanner.
Why did I do that?

157
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:08,927
Excuse me. Excuse me.

158
00:16:09,135 --> 00:16:14,573
Like I said, this part of my life
is called "Being Stupid. "

159
00:16:17,743 --> 00:16:22,476
Hey! Hey! Hey! Don't move!
Don't move! Stay--!

160
00:16:30,423 --> 00:16:32,789
Stop! Stop!

161
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:36,189
Don't move!
Stop this--! Stop the train!

162
00:16:37,229 --> 00:16:39,527
Stop! Stop!

163
00:16:54,447 --> 00:16:58,178
The program took just 20 people
every six months.

164
00:16:58,384 --> 00:17:00,477
One got the job.

165
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:07,391
There were three blank lines after
"high school" to list more education.

166
00:17:08,928 --> 00:17:11,726
I didn't need that many lines.

167
00:17:16,802 --> 00:17:19,794
T ry and sleep. It's late.

168
00:17:29,782 --> 00:17:33,377
It's a puzzle measuring just 3 inches
by 3 inches on each side...

169
00:17:33,586 --> 00:17:36,020
...made up of multiple colors
that you twist and turn...

170
00:17:36,222 --> 00:17:38,816
...and try to get
to a solid color on each side.

171
00:17:39,025 --> 00:17:42,654
This little cube
is the gift sensation of 1 98 1.

172
00:17:42,862 --> 00:17:44,261
Don't expect to solve it easily.

173
00:17:44,463 --> 00:17:46,897
Although we did encounter
one math professor at USF...

174
00:17:47,099 --> 00:17:49,590
... who took just 30 minutes on his.

175
00:17:49,802 --> 00:17:52,032
This is as far as I've gotten
on mine.

176
00:17:52,238 --> 00:17:55,605
As you can see,
I still have a long way to go.

177
00:17:55,808 --> 00:17:58,436
This is Jim Finnerty reporting
for KJSF in Richmond.

178
00:17:58,644 --> 00:18:01,340
Hey, wake up.

179
00:18:01,547 --> 00:18:03,071
Eat.

180
00:18:04,183 --> 00:18:06,651
-Bye, Mom.
-Bye, baby.

181
00:18:06,852 --> 00:18:09,844
-Come back without that, please.
-Oh, yeah, I'm going to.

182
00:18:10,056 --> 00:18:12,991
So go ahead, say goodbye to it,
because I'm coming back without it.

183
00:18:13,192 --> 00:18:15,626
Goodbye and good riddance.

184
00:18:15,828 --> 00:18:17,796
You ain't had to add
the "good riddance" part.

185
00:18:17,997 --> 00:18:19,055
Bye, Mom.

186
00:18:20,566 --> 00:18:21,931
Bye.

187
00:18:22,134 --> 00:18:25,729
It's written as P-P-Y, but it's
supposed to be an I in "happiness."

188
00:18:25,938 --> 00:18:29,066
-ls it an adjective?
-No, actually it's a noun.

189
00:18:29,275 --> 00:18:31,004
But it's not spelled right.

190
00:18:31,210 --> 00:18:34,805
-ls "fuck" spelled right?
-Yeah, that's spelled right.

191
00:18:35,014 --> 00:18:38,142
But that's not part of the motto,
so you're not supposed to learn that.

192
00:18:38,350 --> 00:18:43,253
That's an adult word to show anger
and other things.

193
00:18:43,456 --> 00:18:46,323
-But just don't use that one, okay?
-Okay.

194
00:18:46,525 --> 00:18:48,686
What's that say
on the back of your bag?

195
00:18:49,028 --> 00:18:50,996
My nickname.

196
00:18:51,197 --> 00:18:52,789
We pick nicknames.

197
00:18:52,998 --> 00:18:56,365
-Oh, yeah? What's it say?
-"Hot Rod."

198
00:18:59,371 --> 00:19:01,396
-Did you have a nickname?
-Yep.

199
00:19:01,607 --> 00:19:04,337
-What?
-"Ten-Gallon Head."

200
00:19:04,543 --> 00:19:07,444
-What's that?
-I grew up in Louisiana, near Texas.

201
00:19:07,646 --> 00:19:12,276
Everybody wears cowboy hats.
And a ten-gallon's a big hat.

202
00:19:12,485 --> 00:19:16,046
I was smart back then,
so they called me Ten-Gallon Head.

203
00:19:16,655 --> 00:19:18,782
-Hoss wears that hat.
-Hoss?

204
00:19:19,058 --> 00:19:20,787
Hoss Cartwright on Bonanza.

205
00:19:21,227 --> 00:19:24,754
-How do you know Bonanza?
-We watch it at Mrs. Chu's.

206
00:19:25,431 --> 00:19:28,525
-You watch Bonanza at daycare?
-Yeah.

207
00:19:29,602 --> 00:19:31,661
When? When do you watch it?

208
00:19:31,871 --> 00:19:35,534
-After snack? After your nap?
-After Love Boat.

209
00:19:40,446 --> 00:19:42,607
I made my list for my birthday.

210
00:19:43,382 --> 00:19:47,910
-Yeah, what'd you put on there?
-A basketball or an ant farm.

211
00:19:51,524 --> 00:19:55,790
-He says he's been watching TV.
-Oh, little TV for history.

212
00:19:55,995 --> 00:19:59,089
-Love Boat?
-For history. Navy.

213
00:19:59,798 --> 00:20:01,561
That's not the Navy.

214
00:20:01,767 --> 00:20:03,894
I mean, he could
watch television at home.

215
00:20:04,103 --> 00:20:08,472
We're paying you $1 50 a month.
If he's gonna be sitting around...

216
00:20:08,674 --> 00:20:11,074
...watching TV all day,
we're taking him out of here.

217
00:20:11,277 --> 00:20:15,077
Go pay more at other daycare
if you don't like Navy TV.

218
00:20:16,949 --> 00:20:22,148
You late pay anyway.
You complain. I complain.

219
00:20:23,656 --> 00:20:27,456
Can you at least put the dog upstairs
in your room or something?

220
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:29,127
Bye.

221
00:21:13,505 --> 00:21:17,407
I was waiting for
Witter Resource head Jay Twistle...

222
00:21:17,643 --> 00:21:23,138
...whose name sounded so delightful,
like he'd give me a job and a hug.

223
00:21:23,349 --> 00:21:27,342
I just had to show him I was good
with numbers and good with people.

224
00:21:27,553 --> 00:21:29,111
-Morning, Mr. Twistle.
-Good morning.

225
00:21:29,321 --> 00:21:30,720
-Mr. Twistle, Chris Gardner.
-Hi.

226
00:21:30,923 --> 00:21:33,721
I wanted to drop this off personally
and make your acquaintance.

227
00:21:33,926 --> 00:21:37,327
I thought I'd catch you on the way in.
I'd love the opportunity to discuss...

228
00:21:37,529 --> 00:21:39,759
...what may seem like weaknesses
on my application.

229
00:21:39,965 --> 00:21:42,763
We'll start with this, and we'll call you
if we wanna sit down.

230
00:21:42,968 --> 00:21:45,937
-Yes, sir. You have a great day.
-You too.

231
00:21:52,978 --> 00:21:54,570
Hey, yeah, how you doing?

232
00:21:54,780 --> 00:21:56,975
This is Chris Gardner calling
for Dr. Delsey.

233
00:21:57,182 --> 00:21:59,343
Yeah, I'm running a little late
for a sales call.

234
00:21:59,551 --> 00:22:03,043
I was wondering if--
Yeah, Osteo National.

235
00:22:03,289 --> 00:22:05,814
Right. We can still--? Half an hour?

236
00:22:06,025 --> 00:22:09,688
Yes. Beautiful. Beautiful.
Thank you, thank you.

237
00:22:19,238 --> 00:22:22,366
Hey! Hey!

238
00:22:23,475 --> 00:22:24,840
Hey!

239
00:22:25,044 --> 00:22:26,409
This part of my life...

240
00:22:26,612 --> 00:22:29,308
-Wait!
-...this part here...

241
00:22:30,883 --> 00:22:32,510
...it's called "Running. "

242
00:22:32,718 --> 00:22:34,652
Hey! Hey!

243
00:22:34,853 --> 00:22:36,411
Wait!

244
00:22:37,323 --> 00:22:40,156
Hey! Wait!

245
00:22:40,359 --> 00:22:42,725
That was my stolen machine.

246
00:22:42,928 --> 00:22:44,987
Unless she was with
a guy who sold them too.

247
00:22:46,532 --> 00:22:47,760
Which was unlikely...

248
00:22:47,966 --> 00:22:50,628
...because I was the only one
selling them in the Bay Area.

249
00:22:50,836 --> 00:22:53,498
I spent our entire life savings
on these things.

250
00:22:55,908 --> 00:22:59,503
It was such
a revolutionary machine.

251
00:23:00,646 --> 00:23:02,079
-Can you feel it, baby?
-Oh, yeah.

252
00:23:02,281 --> 00:23:03,805
You got me doing all the work.

253
00:23:04,016 --> 00:23:06,541
What I didn't know
is that doctors and hospitals...

254
00:23:06,752 --> 00:23:10,620
...would consider them
unnecessary luxuries.

255
00:23:13,258 --> 00:23:16,694
I even asked the landlord
to take a picture.

256
00:23:17,963 --> 00:23:22,866
So if I lost one, it was like losing
a month's groceries.

257
00:23:25,771 --> 00:23:28,740
Hey, hey! Wait! Wait!

258
00:23:31,610 --> 00:23:34,306
Hey, get back here!

259
00:23:38,884 --> 00:23:41,375
Hey, man, l--

260
00:23:43,222 --> 00:23:45,554
-Who's he?
-He's that guy....

261
00:23:56,034 --> 00:23:59,936
-Did you forget?
-Forget what?

262
00:24:00,873 --> 00:24:03,364
You're not supposed
to have any of those.

263
00:24:03,575 --> 00:24:06,806
-Yeah, I know.
-You have two now.

264
00:24:17,189 --> 00:24:18,713
Hey.

265
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:23,287
Hey, Mom.

266
00:24:28,634 --> 00:24:32,502
One, two, three!

267
00:24:33,572 --> 00:24:36,700
-That's a basketball!
-Hey, hey. What do you mean?

268
00:24:36,909 --> 00:24:38,638
You don't know that
that's a basketball.

269
00:24:38,844 --> 00:24:42,746
This could be an ant farm. This could
be a microscope or anything.

270
00:24:42,948 --> 00:24:45,416
-No, it's not.
-There, there.

271
00:24:45,851 --> 00:24:48,911
All right, come on.
Open him up. Open him up.

272
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:59,197
-That paper's a little heavy, huh?
-Yeah, but I got it.

273
00:25:10,409 --> 00:25:12,969
You should've seen me
out there today.

274
00:25:13,178 --> 00:25:15,703
Somebody stole a scanner.
I had to run the old girl down--

275
00:25:15,914 --> 00:25:17,506
Whatever.

276
00:25:19,084 --> 00:25:22,178
-What?
-Whatever, Chris.

277
00:25:22,754 --> 00:25:24,585
What the hell
you got attitude about?

278
00:25:24,790 --> 00:25:27,588
-"Whatever" what?
-Every day's got some damn story.

279
00:25:27,793 --> 00:25:29,158
Hey, Roy. Roy!

280
00:25:29,361 --> 00:25:31,659
Can you beat your little rug
when nobody's out here?

281
00:25:31,864 --> 00:25:33,297
There's dust and shit all over.

282
00:25:33,499 --> 00:25:35,899
-I'm trying to keep a clean house.
-Hey, wait a second.

283
00:25:36,101 --> 00:25:38,865
Look, Linda, relax.

284
00:25:39,071 --> 00:25:42,404
We're gonna come out of this.
Everything is gonna be fine, all right?

285
00:25:43,509 --> 00:25:47,411
You said that before,
when I got pregnant. "lt'll be fine."

286
00:25:47,613 --> 00:25:52,607
-So you don't trust me now?
-Whatever. I don't care.

287
00:26:07,799 --> 00:26:10,029
-Taxi!
-Mr. Twistle.

288
00:26:10,235 --> 00:26:12,897
-Yeah, hi.
-Hi. Chris Gardner.

289
00:26:13,105 --> 00:26:14,936
Yeah, hi. Listen.
What can I do for you?

290
00:26:15,140 --> 00:26:18,200
I submitted an application for the
intern program about a month ago...

291
00:26:18,410 --> 00:26:20,640
...and I would just love
to sit with you briefly--

292
00:26:20,846 --> 00:26:22,814
Listen, I'm going
to Noe Valley, Chris.

293
00:26:23,015 --> 00:26:26,314
-Take care of yourself.
-Mr. Twistle.

294
00:26:26,518 --> 00:26:28,884
Actually, I'm on my way
to Noe Valley also.

295
00:26:29,087 --> 00:26:30,816
How about we share a ride?

296
00:26:32,324 --> 00:26:34,485
-All right, get in.
-All right.

297
00:26:40,599 --> 00:26:43,329
So when I was in the Navy,
I worked for a doctor...

298
00:26:43,535 --> 00:26:46,368
...who loved to play golf,
hours every day...

299
00:26:46,572 --> 00:26:51,202
...and I would actually
perform medical procedures...

300
00:26:51,410 --> 00:26:52,968
...when he'd leave me in the office.

301
00:26:53,178 --> 00:26:58,445
So I'm used to being in a position
where I have to make decisions and....

302
00:26:59,918 --> 00:27:02,751
Mr. Twistle, listen.
This is a very important--

303
00:27:02,955 --> 00:27:05,150
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
This thing's impossible.

304
00:27:07,225 --> 00:27:09,352
-I can do it.
-No, you can't. No one can.

305
00:27:09,561 --> 00:27:12,223
-That's bullshit.
-No, I'm pretty sure I can do it.

306
00:27:12,698 --> 00:27:15,861
-No, you can't.
-Let me see it.

307
00:27:16,435 --> 00:27:17,663
Give it here.

308
00:27:20,639 --> 00:27:24,939
Oh, yeah. Oh, wow,
you really messed it up.

309
00:27:25,143 --> 00:27:26,667
Sorry.

310
00:27:27,212 --> 00:27:33,173
It looks like it works around a swivel,
so the center pieces never move.

311
00:27:33,385 --> 00:27:36,479
So if it's yellow in the center,
that's the yellow side.

312
00:27:36,688 --> 00:27:39,179
If it's red in the center,
that's the red side.

313
00:27:39,391 --> 00:27:43,020
-Okay.
-So.... You can slow down.

314
00:27:43,228 --> 00:27:46,288
Listen, we can drive around all day.
I don't believe you can do this.

315
00:27:46,498 --> 00:27:48,193
-Yeah, I can.
-No, you can't.

316
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:49,560
-Yes, I can.
-No, you can't.

317
00:27:49,768 --> 00:27:51,702
I'm telling you, no one can.

318
00:27:53,605 --> 00:27:55,869
See? That's all I ever do.

319
00:28:08,754 --> 00:28:11,052
You almost have this side.

320
00:28:11,657 --> 00:28:13,124
Holy cow.

321
00:28:23,335 --> 00:28:27,135
-You almost had that one.
-I'm gonna get it.

322
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:36,443
Look at that.

323
00:28:59,705 --> 00:29:00,933
You're almost there.

324
00:29:24,663 --> 00:29:28,360
-1 7.1 0.
-This is me.

325
00:29:30,502 --> 00:29:31,901
Good job.

326
00:29:33,705 --> 00:29:36,833
-Goodbye.
-Yeah. I'll see you soon.

327
00:29:39,244 --> 00:29:40,973
Where are you going, sir?

328
00:29:41,179 --> 00:29:44,171
Excuse me, sir.
Where are you going, please?

329
00:29:47,486 --> 00:29:49,249
Two-- A couple of blocks.

330
00:29:49,454 --> 00:29:52,855
-Just flip around.
-Okay.

331
00:30:34,766 --> 00:30:37,530
Hey! Stop it! Hey!

332
00:30:37,903 --> 00:30:39,461
-Where are you going? Come here!
-No!

333
00:30:39,671 --> 00:30:42,504
-No, no, no!
-You asshole, give me my money!

334
00:30:42,707 --> 00:30:44,038
-Give me my money.
-Please stop.

335
00:30:44,242 --> 00:30:46,233
-Please, please, please!
-Son of a bitch.

336
00:30:46,444 --> 00:30:49,004
Please! He should've paid you!

337
00:30:49,214 --> 00:30:50,738
-Come here!
-I'm sorry.

338
00:30:50,949 --> 00:30:52,644
-I'm so sorry.
-I'll kick your ass!

339
00:30:53,118 --> 00:30:56,281
-I'm sorry!
-ldiot.

340
00:31:07,098 --> 00:31:08,429
I'll get you!

341
00:31:08,633 --> 00:31:12,125
I'm going to kill you!
I'm going to kill you!

342
00:31:27,519 --> 00:31:29,612
Hey!

343
00:31:29,821 --> 00:31:32,722
Stop it, you son of a bitch!

344
00:31:32,991 --> 00:31:35,084
Stop him!

345
00:31:38,496 --> 00:31:41,021
Stop him!

346
00:31:46,271 --> 00:31:47,966
The doors are closing.

347
00:31:48,173 --> 00:31:51,006
Please stand clear of the doors.

348
00:31:58,950 --> 00:32:02,078
No! No! No!

349
00:32:04,756 --> 00:32:06,553
No!

350
00:32:29,714 --> 00:32:32,080
-Hello?
-Hey, yeah.

351
00:32:32,284 --> 00:32:33,979
Sorry I couldn't
make it home on time.

352
00:32:34,185 --> 00:32:38,417
-Chris, I missed my shift.
-Yeah, I know. I'm sorry about that.

353
00:32:38,623 --> 00:32:41,922
Look, I'm on my way right now.
Are you all right with Christopher?

354
00:32:42,127 --> 00:32:44,493
I'm leaving. Chris, I'm leaving.

355
00:32:44,696 --> 00:32:46,687
-What?
-Did you hear what I said?

356
00:32:47,565 --> 00:32:51,501
I have my things together,
and I'm taking our son...

357
00:32:51,703 --> 00:32:53,227
...and we're gonna leave now.

358
00:32:53,605 --> 00:32:55,004
I'm gonna put the phone down.

359
00:32:55,206 --> 00:32:58,733
-Linda, wait a minute. Hold it, hold--
-I'm going to leave. We are leaving.

360
00:33:03,915 --> 00:33:07,874
It was right then that I started
thinking about Thomas Jefferson...

361
00:33:09,187 --> 00:33:11,655
...the Declaration of Independence...

362
00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:17,951
...and the part about our right to life,
liberty and the pursuit of happiness.

363
00:33:18,163 --> 00:33:19,994
And I remember thinking:

364
00:33:20,198 --> 00:33:24,567
How did he know
to put the "pursuit" part in there?

365
00:33:24,769 --> 00:33:29,468
That maybe happiness is something
that we can only pursue.

366
00:33:29,674 --> 00:33:32,700
And maybe we can actually
never have it...

367
00:33:33,044 --> 00:33:34,705
...no matter what.

368
00:33:34,913 --> 00:33:36,608
How did he know that?

369
00:33:41,853 --> 00:33:44,651
Linda. Linda.

370
00:34:17,589 --> 00:34:19,284
-Hello?
-Chris.

371
00:34:19,491 --> 00:34:22,119
-Who is this?
-Jay Twistle.

372
00:34:22,961 --> 00:34:24,792
-Hey.
-Dean Witter.

373
00:34:24,996 --> 00:34:27,692
Yeah, of course. How are you?

374
00:34:27,899 --> 00:34:30,367
I'm fine. Listen, do you still
wanna come in and talk?

375
00:34:30,568 --> 00:34:31,830
Yes, sir. Absolutely.

376
00:34:32,037 --> 00:34:34,938
I'll tell you what. Come on by
day after tomorrow, in the morning.

377
00:34:35,140 --> 00:34:38,906
We're interviewing for the internships.
You got a pen and paper?

378
00:34:39,144 --> 00:34:40,668
Yes. Yes, I do.

379
00:34:43,648 --> 00:34:46,412
-Hold on one second.
-All right.

380
00:34:50,288 --> 00:34:52,415
Hello?

381
00:34:52,624 --> 00:34:54,956
-Chris?
-Go ahead. I have one.

382
00:34:55,160 --> 00:34:57,788
Write this number down so you can
call my secretary, Janice.

383
00:34:57,996 --> 00:35:00,055
-She can give you all the specifics.
-Yep.

384
00:35:00,265 --> 00:35:02,130
-Okay, 41 5.
-41 5.

385
00:35:02,333 --> 00:35:04,028

386
00:35:04,235 --> 00:35:06,260

387
00:35:06,471 --> 00:35:09,463
-Yeah, extension 4796.

388
00:35:09,674 --> 00:35:13,940
-Right. Call her tomorrow.
-Yes, sir. 41 5-864-0256.

389
00:35:14,145 --> 00:35:15,442
-Okay, buddy.
-All right, yes.

390
00:35:15,647 --> 00:35:17,808
-Thank you very much.
-We'll see you soon.

391
00:35:18,583 --> 00:35:21,746
864-0256.

392
00:35:21,953 --> 00:35:25,150
4796. Janice.

393
00:35:28,193 --> 00:35:30,024
-Chris.
-Hey.

394
00:35:30,228 --> 00:35:32,492
Did you--? Have you seen
Linda and Christopher?

395
00:35:32,697 --> 00:35:34,597
-No. You catch the game last night?
-No, no.

396
00:35:34,799 --> 00:35:36,164
You didn't see that, 1 1 8, 1 --?

397
00:35:36,367 --> 00:35:38,562
Excuse me, did Linda
and Christopher come in here?

398
00:35:38,770 --> 00:35:42,433
-No, I haven't see them.
-1 1 9-1 20. Double overtime.

399
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:44,767
Moons hits a three-pointer
at 1 7 seconds left.

400
00:35:44,976 --> 00:35:46,568
Wayne, Wayne, Wayne.

401
00:35:46,778 --> 00:35:48,905
Can't talk to you
about numbers right now.

402
00:35:49,114 --> 00:35:51,742
-What's your problem with numbers?
-864-2....

403
00:35:51,950 --> 00:35:53,884
-And you owe me money.
-Yeah.

404
00:35:54,085 --> 00:35:55,848
You owe me $1 4.

405
00:35:56,054 --> 00:35:57,919
I'm gonna get that to you.

406
00:35:58,790 --> 00:36:01,258
I need my money.
I need my money.

407
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:04,453
Fourteen's a number.

408
00:36:30,889 --> 00:36:34,120
Hey, don't you ever take my son
away from me again.

409
00:36:34,325 --> 00:36:35,622
-You hear me?
-Leave me alone!

410
00:36:35,827 --> 00:36:37,658
Don't take my son away
from me again.

411
00:36:37,862 --> 00:36:39,625
Do you understand
what I'm saying to you?

412
00:36:39,831 --> 00:36:43,130
Don't you walk away from me when
I'm talking to you. Do you hear me?

413
00:36:43,334 --> 00:36:44,858
-Do you wanna leave?
-Yeah.

414
00:36:45,069 --> 00:36:47,902
-You wanna leave?
-Yes, I want to leave!

415
00:36:49,140 --> 00:36:51,005
Get the hell out of here,
then, Linda.

416
00:36:51,209 --> 00:36:53,734
Get the hell out of here.
Christopher's staying with me.

417
00:36:53,945 --> 00:36:56,243
You're the one that dragged
us down. You hear me?

418
00:36:56,447 --> 00:36:59,541
-You are so weak.
-No. I am not happy anymore.

419
00:36:59,751 --> 00:37:02,345
-I'm just not happy!
-Then go get happy, Linda!

420
00:37:02,554 --> 00:37:03,919
Just go get happy.

421
00:37:04,455 --> 00:37:06,320
But Christopher's living with me.

422
00:37:06,524 --> 00:37:08,321
-Stop!
-Did you hear what I said?

423
00:37:08,626 --> 00:37:11,026
Christopher's living with me!

424
00:37:37,188 --> 00:37:40,123
Hey. Come on, let's go.

425
00:37:40,325 --> 00:37:42,657
-How you doing, Mrs. Chu?
-Hi.

426
00:37:46,331 --> 00:37:48,891
-Where's Mom?
-Look, just get your stuff.

427
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:52,558
But she told me she was
coming to pick me up today.

428
00:37:52,770 --> 00:37:54,795
Yeah, I know.

429
00:37:55,940 --> 00:38:00,570
I talked to Mom earlier.
Everything's fine, okay?

430
00:38:06,017 --> 00:38:08,212
Where do I sleep tonight?

431
00:38:08,419 --> 00:38:10,546
Let me ask you something.
Are you happy?

432
00:38:10,755 --> 00:38:13,417
-Yeah.
-All right. Because I'm happy.

433
00:38:13,625 --> 00:38:17,083
And if you're happy and I'm happy,
then that's a good thing, right?

434
00:38:17,295 --> 00:38:18,819
-Yeah.
-All right.

435
00:38:19,030 --> 00:38:21,055
You're sleeping with me.

436
00:38:21,266 --> 00:38:25,930
You're staying at home,
where you belong, all right?

437
00:38:40,385 --> 00:38:42,046
Christopher.

438
00:38:59,604 --> 00:39:02,437
Hey, listen. I need the rent.

439
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:04,073
I can't wait anymore.

440
00:39:04,275 --> 00:39:06,675
Yeah, I'm good for that, Charlie.
I'm gonna get it.

441
00:39:06,878 --> 00:39:09,904
Why don't you go two blocks over
at the Mission lnn motel?

442
00:39:10,114 --> 00:39:11,672
It's half what you pay here.

443
00:39:11,883 --> 00:39:15,284
Listen, Chris. I need you out
of here in the morning.

444
00:39:16,654 --> 00:39:18,815
The hell am I supposed
to be out of here tomorrow?

445
00:39:19,023 --> 00:39:20,217
I got painters coming in.

446
00:39:20,425 --> 00:39:22,723
-All right, look. I need more time.
-No.

447
00:39:22,927 --> 00:39:25,054
All right, I'll paint it myself.

448
00:39:25,263 --> 00:39:30,633
All right, but I just-- I gotta have some
more time-- I got my son up in here.

449
00:39:35,473 --> 00:39:40,308
All right. One week.
And you paint it.

450
00:40:32,196 --> 00:40:33,823
Chris Gardner?

451
00:40:34,399 --> 00:40:37,129
Yeah. What happened?

452
00:40:37,335 --> 00:40:41,203
-Payable to the City of San Francisco.
-Does it have to be the full amount?

453
00:40:41,406 --> 00:40:44,898
You gotta pay each parking ticket,
otherwise, you're staying.

454
00:40:45,109 --> 00:40:46,576
This is all I got.

455
00:40:52,049 --> 00:40:54,745
You verify at 9:30
tomorrow morning.

456
00:40:55,286 --> 00:40:58,312
-What?
-You gotta stay until this thing clears.

457
00:41:00,491 --> 00:41:02,049
No.

458
00:41:02,260 --> 00:41:04,057
No, I can't spend the night here.

459
00:41:04,262 --> 00:41:06,856
-I have to pick up my son.
-You verify at 9:30 tomorrow.

460
00:41:07,064 --> 00:41:11,694
Sir, I have a job interview at Dean
Witter at 1 0:1 5 tomorrow morning.

461
00:41:11,903 --> 00:41:13,598
-I cannot stay--
-9:30 tomorrow morning.

462
00:41:13,805 --> 00:41:16,137
What am I supposed to do
with my son?

463
00:41:16,340 --> 00:41:18,808
-ls there anyone else who can--?
-I take care of him.

464
00:41:19,010 --> 00:41:22,036
Maybe we can go and have
Social Services pick him up.

465
00:41:26,083 --> 00:41:29,780
All right.
Can I have my phone call, please?

466
00:41:32,957 --> 00:41:35,221
-Hello.
-Hey.

467
00:41:35,426 --> 00:41:37,155
What do you want?

468
00:41:38,296 --> 00:41:42,926
You gotta get Christopher
from daycare. I can't.

469
00:41:44,101 --> 00:41:47,764
Just keep him for the night and I'm--
And-- Just one night.

470
00:41:47,972 --> 00:41:50,031
What happened?

471
00:41:50,241 --> 00:41:53,699
I'll pick him up
from daycare tomorrow.

472
00:41:53,911 --> 00:41:55,674
I'm gonna go right--
You can just--

473
00:41:55,880 --> 00:41:58,178
You can drop him off
and I'll pick him up.

474
00:41:58,516 --> 00:42:01,952
-No.
-Come on, Linda.

475
00:42:02,153 --> 00:42:06,419
-Why you doing that?
-No, I wanna take him to the park.

476
00:42:06,858 --> 00:42:10,954
To Golden Gate
after daycare tomorrow.

477
00:42:12,230 --> 00:42:14,357
-How is he?
-He's fine.

478
00:42:14,565 --> 00:42:17,625
All right, just-- All right,
take him to the park...

479
00:42:17,835 --> 00:42:21,635
...and bring him back, all right?

480
00:42:21,839 --> 00:42:24,808
All right, just bring me my son back.

481
00:42:25,776 --> 00:42:27,676
Okay?

482
00:42:27,879 --> 00:42:29,403
Linda?

483
00:42:29,614 --> 00:42:31,514
I'll bring him back around 6.

484
00:42:33,384 --> 00:42:35,545
All right, all right.

485
00:42:35,753 --> 00:42:37,618
Thank you.

486
00:42:40,057 --> 00:42:41,547
Bye.

487
00:43:06,350 --> 00:43:08,079
I'm okay?

488
00:43:43,020 --> 00:43:45,147
Excuse me. Excuse me.

489
00:43:45,690 --> 00:43:47,157
Yes, I did.

490
00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:57,597
Mr. Gardner.

491
00:44:04,675 --> 00:44:06,575
This way.

492
00:44:08,813 --> 00:44:10,838
It'll be right this way.

493
00:44:22,927 --> 00:44:24,360
What is the word on that one?

494
00:44:46,017 --> 00:44:47,882
Chris Gardner.

495
00:44:50,454 --> 00:44:52,115
Chris Gardner.

496
00:44:52,556 --> 00:44:54,547
How are you? Good morning.

497
00:44:55,126 --> 00:44:59,028
Chris Gardner. Chris Gardner.
Good to see you again.

498
00:44:59,230 --> 00:45:01,198
Chris Gardner. Pleasure.

499
00:45:02,833 --> 00:45:04,926
I've been sitting there
for the last half-hour...

500
00:45:05,136 --> 00:45:06,694
...trying to come up with a story...

501
00:45:06,904 --> 00:45:11,170
...that would explain my being here
dressed like this.

502
00:45:11,375 --> 00:45:15,402
And I wanted to come up with a story
that would demonstrate qualities...

503
00:45:15,613 --> 00:45:20,448
...that I'm sure you all admire here,
like earnestness or diligence.

504
00:45:20,651 --> 00:45:25,350
Team-playing, something.
And I couldn't think of anything.

505
00:45:26,524 --> 00:45:28,287
So the truth is...

506
00:45:28,492 --> 00:45:31,120
...I was arrested
for failure to pay parking tickets.

507
00:45:31,328 --> 00:45:33,193
Parking tickets?

508
00:45:33,698 --> 00:45:37,259
And I ran all the way here from
the Polk Station, the police station.

509
00:45:37,468 --> 00:45:39,459
What were you doing
before you were arrested?

510
00:45:39,670 --> 00:45:42,696
I was painting my apartment.

511
00:45:42,907 --> 00:45:45,068
Is it dry now?

512
00:45:45,810 --> 00:45:47,004
I hope so.

513
00:45:47,211 --> 00:45:48,940
Jay says you're pretty determined.

514
00:45:49,146 --> 00:45:51,512
He's been waiting outside
the front of the building...

515
00:45:51,716 --> 00:45:53,843
...with some 40-pound gizmo
for over a month.

516
00:45:54,051 --> 00:45:57,452
-He said you're smart.
-Well, I like to think so.

517
00:45:57,655 --> 00:46:00,647
-And you want to learn this business?
-Yes, sir, I wanna learn.

518
00:46:00,858 --> 00:46:02,883
Have you already started learning
on your own?

519
00:46:03,094 --> 00:46:04,755
Absolutely.

520
00:46:05,496 --> 00:46:07,293
-Jay?
-Yes, sir.

521
00:46:07,498 --> 00:46:09,591
How many times
have you seen Chris?

522
00:46:09,800 --> 00:46:12,462
I don't know.
One too many, apparently.

523
00:46:13,070 --> 00:46:15,436
-Was he ever dressed like this?
-No.

524
00:46:15,639 --> 00:46:17,834
No. Jacket and tie.

525
00:46:19,744 --> 00:46:22,645
First in your class in school?

526
00:46:22,847 --> 00:46:24,678
-High school?
-Yes, sir.

527
00:46:25,116 --> 00:46:28,108
-How many in the class?
-Twelve.

528
00:46:28,319 --> 00:46:30,048
It was a small town.

529
00:46:30,488 --> 00:46:33,855
-I'll say.
-But I was also first in my radar class...

530
00:46:34,058 --> 00:46:37,323
...in the Navy,
and that was a class of 20.

531
00:46:39,797 --> 00:46:41,628
Can I say something?

532
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:44,495
I'm the type of person...

533
00:46:44,702 --> 00:46:47,967
...if you ask me a question,
and I don't know the answer...

534
00:46:48,172 --> 00:46:50,436
...I'm gonna tell you
that I don't know.

535
00:46:50,641 --> 00:46:51,972
But I bet you what.

536
00:46:52,176 --> 00:46:57,170
I know how to find the answer,
and I will find the answer.

537
00:46:58,382 --> 00:47:00,111
Is that fair enough?

538
00:47:01,352 --> 00:47:02,546
Chris.

539
00:47:03,888 --> 00:47:07,619
What would you say
if a guy walked in for an interview...

540
00:47:07,825 --> 00:47:09,816
...without a shirt on...

541
00:47:10,027 --> 00:47:12,962
...and I hired him?
What would you say?

542
00:47:17,201 --> 00:47:20,295
He must've had on
some really nice pants.

543
00:47:34,985 --> 00:47:38,546
Chris, I don't know how you did it
dressed as a garbage man...

544
00:47:38,756 --> 00:47:41,020
-...but you pulled it off.
-Thank you, Mr. Twistle.

545
00:47:41,225 --> 00:47:43,625
Hey, now you can call me Jay.
We'll talk to you soon.

546
00:47:44,228 --> 00:47:46,753
All right, so I'll let you know, Jay.

547
00:47:47,565 --> 00:47:49,863
"You'll let me know, Jay"?
What do you mean?

548
00:47:50,067 --> 00:47:52,035
Yeah, I'll give you a call
tomorrow sometime--

549
00:47:52,236 --> 00:47:54,363
What are you talking--?
You hounded me for this.

550
00:47:54,572 --> 00:47:57,336
-You stood here--
-Listen, there's no salary.

551
00:47:57,541 --> 00:47:58,906
-No.
-I was not aware of that.

552
00:47:59,109 --> 00:48:00,701
My circumstances
have changed some...

553
00:48:01,245 --> 00:48:04,942
-...and I need to be certain that I'll be--
-All right. Okay.

554
00:48:08,085 --> 00:48:09,677
Tonight.

555
00:48:09,887 --> 00:48:13,379
I swear I will fill your spot. I promise.

556
00:48:13,591 --> 00:48:16,583
If you back out, you know what
I'll look like to the partners?

557
00:48:16,794 --> 00:48:19,763
Yes, an ass-- A-hole.

558
00:48:20,064 --> 00:48:23,465
Yeah, an ass A-hole, all the way.

559
00:48:26,337 --> 00:48:28,931
You are a piece of work.

560
00:48:29,974 --> 00:48:31,532
Tonight.

561
00:48:39,817 --> 00:48:41,785
There was no salary.

562
00:48:41,986 --> 00:48:45,149
Not even a reasonable promise
of a job.

563
00:48:51,829 --> 00:48:56,459
One intern was hired at the end
of the program from a pool of 20.

564
00:48:56,800 --> 00:48:58,097
And if you weren't that guy...

565
00:48:58,302 --> 00:49:00,668
...you couldn't even apply
the six months' training...

566
00:49:00,871 --> 00:49:02,702
... to another brokerage.

567
00:49:05,242 --> 00:49:07,369
The only resource I would have
for six months...

568
00:49:07,578 --> 00:49:11,514
... would be my six scanners,
which I could still try to sell.

569
00:49:12,716 --> 00:49:16,174
If I sold them all,
maybe we might get by.

570
00:50:03,067 --> 00:50:06,298
-I got him. I got him.
-He's asleep.

571
00:50:06,503 --> 00:50:08,027
All right.

572
00:50:14,411 --> 00:50:16,311
Okay, baby.

573
00:50:28,859 --> 00:50:30,622
I got it.

574
00:50:35,599 --> 00:50:37,658
I'm going to New York.

575
00:51:07,097 --> 00:51:09,429
My sister's boyfriend...

576
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:13,492
...opened a restaurant,
and they may have a job for me there.

577
00:51:14,271 --> 00:51:16,762
So I'm going to New York, Chris.

578
00:51:19,743 --> 00:51:21,643
Christopher's staying with me.

579
00:51:28,585 --> 00:51:31,418
I'm his mom, you know?

580
00:51:31,622 --> 00:51:33,715
He should be with his mom.

581
00:51:33,924 --> 00:51:35,789
I should have him, right?

582
00:51:36,660 --> 00:51:39,026
You know
you can't take care of him.

583
00:51:46,937 --> 00:51:48,461
What are you gonna do for money?

584
00:51:50,707 --> 00:51:56,202
I had an interview
at Dean Witter for an internship...

585
00:51:56,413 --> 00:51:57,880
...and I got it.

586
00:51:58,082 --> 00:52:00,642
So I'm gonna stand out
in my program.

587
00:52:02,352 --> 00:52:04,445
Salesman to intern's backwards.

588
00:52:04,655 --> 00:52:06,589
No, it's not.

589
00:52:08,725 --> 00:52:10,420
I gotta go.

590
00:52:43,994 --> 00:52:46,360
Tell him I love him, okay?

591
00:52:46,997 --> 00:52:48,589
And....

592
00:52:54,538 --> 00:52:56,870
I know you'll take care of him, Chris.

593
00:52:57,074 --> 00:52:58,769
I know that.

594
00:53:40,384 --> 00:53:43,114
-Dean Witter.
-Yes, hi.

595
00:53:43,420 --> 00:53:47,151
Yes, I'd like to leave a message
for Mr. Jay Twistle.

596
00:53:47,357 --> 00:53:50,918
-Your name?
-Yeah, my name is Chris Gardner.

597
00:53:51,128 --> 00:53:52,254
The message is:

598
00:53:52,462 --> 00:53:58,128
Thank you very much
for inviting me into the program.

599
00:53:58,335 --> 00:54:04,205
I really appreciate it and I'd be
very pleased to accept your invitation.

600
00:54:04,408 --> 00:54:06,273
Is that all?

601
00:54:06,543 --> 00:54:08,101
Yes, that's it.

602
00:54:08,312 --> 00:54:10,075
-Okay.
-Thank you.

603
00:54:10,280 --> 00:54:11,838
Bye.

604
00:54:38,442 --> 00:54:39,739
-Be careful with that.
-What?

605
00:54:39,943 --> 00:54:42,707
Be care-- Go ahead.

606
00:55:06,570 --> 00:55:09,505
-Are we there?
-Yep.

607
00:55:22,786 --> 00:55:25,346
-Hey, you know what today is?
-Yeah.

608
00:55:25,555 --> 00:55:27,216
-What?
-Saturday.

609
00:55:27,424 --> 00:55:29,722
-You know what Saturday is, right?
-Yeah.

610
00:55:29,926 --> 00:55:32,360
-What?
-Basketball.

611
00:55:32,562 --> 00:55:35,463
-You wanna go play some basketball?
-Okay.

612
00:55:35,666 --> 00:55:38,226
All right, then we're gonna go
sell a bone-density scanner.

613
00:55:38,435 --> 00:55:42,701
-How about that? Wanna do that?
-No.

614
00:55:43,907 --> 00:55:46,307
Hey, Dad. I'm going pro.

615
00:55:48,011 --> 00:55:49,979
I'm going pro.

616
00:55:51,248 --> 00:55:52,613
Okay.

617
00:55:52,816 --> 00:55:55,614
Yeah, I don't know, you know.

618
00:55:56,353 --> 00:55:58,583
You'll probably be about as good
as I was.

619
00:55:58,789 --> 00:56:01,883
That's kind of the way it works,
you know. I was below average.

620
00:56:02,259 --> 00:56:05,888
You know, so you'll probably
ultimately rank...

621
00:56:06,096 --> 00:56:08,724
...somewhere around there,
you know, so...

622
00:56:08,932 --> 00:56:11,799
...I really-- You'll excel at
a lot of things, just not this.

623
00:56:12,002 --> 00:56:14,436
I don't want you shooting
this ball all day and night.

624
00:56:14,638 --> 00:56:16,162
-All right?
-All right.

625
00:56:16,373 --> 00:56:18,204
Okay.

626
00:56:19,343 --> 00:56:20,970
All right, go ahead.

627
00:56:44,801 --> 00:56:46,428
Hey.

628
00:56:49,606 --> 00:56:51,938
Don't ever let somebody tell you...

629
00:56:52,142 --> 00:56:54,702
...you can't do something.

630
00:56:55,412 --> 00:56:57,505
Not even me.

631
00:56:58,849 --> 00:57:02,046
-All right?
-All right.

632
00:57:02,719 --> 00:57:04,914
You got a dream...

633
00:57:05,122 --> 00:57:07,352
...you gotta protect it.

634
00:57:08,458 --> 00:57:10,119
People can't do something
themselves...

635
00:57:10,327 --> 00:57:12,761
...they wanna tell you
you can't do it.

636
00:57:17,100 --> 00:57:20,900
If you want something,
go get it. Period.

637
00:57:28,945 --> 00:57:30,503
Let's go.

638
00:57:32,682 --> 00:57:33,517
Dad, why did we move to a motel?

639
00:57:33,517 --> 00:57:36,145
Dad, why did we move to a motel?

640
00:57:36,353 --> 00:57:38,821
I told you. Because I'm getting
a better job.

641
00:57:40,090 --> 00:57:43,116
-You gotta trust me, all right?
-I trust you.

642
00:57:43,326 --> 00:57:46,056
All right, here.
Come on, come on. Keep up.

643
00:57:47,297 --> 00:57:50,266
Dad, when's Mom coming back?

644
00:57:50,801 --> 00:57:52,996
Dad, when's Mom coming back?

645
00:57:53,203 --> 00:57:55,433
I don't know, Christopher.

646
00:57:55,772 --> 00:57:57,706
Dad, listen to this.

647
00:57:57,908 --> 00:58:01,366
One day, a man was drowning
in the water.

648
00:58:01,578 --> 00:58:04,046
And a boat came by and said,
"Do you need any help?"

649
00:58:04,247 --> 00:58:06,579
He said, "No, thank you.
God will save me."

650
00:58:06,783 --> 00:58:09,980
Then another boat came by.
Said, "Do you need any help?"

651
00:58:10,187 --> 00:58:12,553
And he said, "No, thank you.
God will save me."

652
00:58:12,756 --> 00:58:14,883
Then he drowned,
and he went to heaven.

653
00:58:15,091 --> 00:58:18,322
And he said, "God,
why didn't you save me?"

654
00:58:18,528 --> 00:58:22,020
And God said, "l sent you
two big boats, you dummy."

655
00:58:23,333 --> 00:58:24,766
Do you like it?

656
00:58:24,968 --> 00:58:27,698
Yeah, that's very funny, man.
Give me your hand.

657
00:58:33,710 --> 00:58:35,371
-Thank you very much, sir.
-Yes, sir.

658
00:58:35,579 --> 00:58:37,206
-You got the bill of sale here.
-Yes.

659
00:58:37,414 --> 00:58:38,813
All the information you'll need.

660
00:58:39,015 --> 00:58:40,642
Thank you very much
for your business.

661
00:58:40,851 --> 00:58:42,341
Thank you.

662
00:58:45,055 --> 00:58:47,785
One hundred, 200,
20, 40, 45, 46...

663
00:58:47,991 --> 00:58:49,618
...7, 8, 9, 1 0.

664
00:58:50,227 --> 00:58:51,319
Thank you.

665
00:58:53,663 --> 00:58:56,598
-Hey, you want one of those?
-No, it's okay.

666
00:58:56,800 --> 00:58:59,098
Come on, you can have one.
Which one?

667
00:59:00,003 --> 00:59:03,530
-You like that one? How much?
-Twenty-five cents.

668
00:59:17,754 --> 00:59:21,451
This part of my life
is called "Internship. "
