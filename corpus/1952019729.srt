00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:31.840
#  When l met you in the restaurant #

2
00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:37.640
#  You could tell l
was no debutante #

3
00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:41.960
#  You asked me what's
my pleasure #

4
00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:44.760
.t A moyie or ft meftsure? .t

5
00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:47.520
#  l'll have a cup of tea #

6
00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:51.920
#  And tell you of my dreaming #

7
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.800
#  Dreaming is free #

8
00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:57.720
#  Dreaming #

9
00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.760
#  Dreaming is free #

10
00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:06.400
#  l don't want to live on charity #

11
00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:10.920
#  Pleasure's real or is it fantasy? #

12
00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
Hey, check this out.

13
00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:16.160
Everywhere l go, people
totally lose it.

14
00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:18.520
l'm Victoria English...

15
00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.240
sorority princess of
South Beach University.

16
00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.600
And, oh, yeah, this year l've
gotta makeover a bunch...

17
00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:28.120
of clueless freshmen into
Gamma Gamma girls.

18
00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:30.360
Oh, look at this
Shakira wannabe.

19
00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:31.600
See what l mean?

20
00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:34.040
She's taking a freaking
cab instead of a limo.

21
00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:35.840
Not hot.

22
00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:38.440
See, Gamma Gamma
sorority is in a contest...

23
00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:43.240
to become FHM Magazine's
hottest sorority in the country.

24
00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:46.720
Everyone wants to go to
South Beach University.

25
00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:50.080
A couple of years ago, they
Iet unhot people in here...

26
00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:52.640
and things haven't been the same.

27
00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:59.360
l guess i'll just have to put
a blonde wig on this one.

28
00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:10.120
Daddy, stop the car here.

29
00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.520
- But there's a spot up front.
- Dad, this car is embarrassing.

30
00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:14.120
l don't want people to
think that l'm poor.

31
00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:16.600
Well, honey, you are poor.

32
00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:18.600
Look at this little minx.

33
00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:20.480
This is Kristen Ass.

34
00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:22.600
lf l'd have known she'd
come in that car,

35
00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:24.440
l would have never
Iet her pledge.

36
00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:31.120
Excuse me.

37
00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:32.200
So there you have it.

38
00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:35.280
A mission to turn the ''wannabes''
into the ''be wanteds.''

39
00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:36.560
Should be fun.

40
00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:44.200
Smell that?

41
00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:47.400
That, my friends, is the
smell of opportunity.

42
00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:51.440
Fresh, un-tapped poon tang.

43
00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:53.280
Did you just say poon tang?

44
00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:55.400
l mean, that's why they
call them freshmen!

45
00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:58.720
Because their coochies
are fresh for all us men.

46
00:02:58.840 --> 00:02:59.840
What's going on?

47
00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:01.000
- Hello, ladies.
- Hi.

48
00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:03.640
Welcome to South Beach.

49
00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:05.960
l love fresh coochy!

50
00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:12.080
Victoria will be here in 45
seconds, ladies, so smarten up.

51
00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:15.440
#  Whoa, whoa, whoa #

52
00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:21.400
#  Whoa, whoa, whoa #

53
00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:26.520
#  Got somebody, she's a beauty #

54
00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:31.480
#  Very special, really and truly #

55
00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:36.160
#  Take good care of me,
like it's her duty #

56
00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:39.480
Every year, school starts
when l pop out of my limo

57
00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:41.480
and see my shadow.

58
00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:44.760
But l can't see my shadow
because l'm so thin.

59
00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:47.960
Gamma Gamma pledges
ready for inspection.

60
00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:51.200
People say l shouldn't
torture my pledges.

61
00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:54.880
But l say, who says
Iearning can't be fun?

62
00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.520
Sweetie, do you have
any idea who l am?

63
00:03:57.600 --> 00:03:58.920
You're Victoria English.

64
00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:00.800
And what do l do here?

65
00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:03.440
You're the president of the
Gamma Gamma house?

66
00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:05.560
And the ultimate role model
for every college girl

67
00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:07.240
on the face of the earth.

68
00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:08.880
Starting to like this one.

69
00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.800
Wait. Whose top is that?

70
00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:13.040
- Mine?
- No.

71
00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:14.800
Whose top is that,
gamma pledge?

72
00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:16.600
Dolce and Gabbana.

73
00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:19.400
Ma'am, my top is Dolce
and Gabbana, ma'am.

74
00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:21.880
- It's Dolce and Gabbana.
- Don't you forget it.

75
00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:29.440
What the hell kind of
nail color is that?

76
00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:33.400
- It's ''cherries in the snow. ''
- So last week.

77
00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:35.880
Suck it off, Gamma pledge.

78
00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:37.520
l will, ma'am.

79
00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:45.440
You. The shoes.

80
00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:47.440
l saw those on sale
Iast week, didn't i?

81
00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:49.840
No. My mom sent 'em to me.

82
00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:52.840
Those shoes are expired.
Totally unhot.

83
00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:00.160
Two out of three,
this is a disaster.

84
00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:02.360
- Morgan?
- Yes, Victoria? Ma'am.

85
00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:06.520
Please explain to these jackasses
what's at stake this year.

86
00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:08.080
Listen up, ladies.

87
00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:12.360
This year, FHM Magazine will be
selecting the hottest sorority

88
00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:14.960
in the nation to be
featured on their cover...

89
00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:18.440
and we are one of
five finalists.

90
00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:20.960
And l'm not gonna let a bunch
of clueless pledges stand...

91
00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:23.600
in between me and the number
one spot in the country.

92
00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:26.080
- Is that clear?
- Yes, ma'am!

93
00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:28.160
Victoria, we may have
a little problem here.

94
00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:29.440
What?

95
00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:34.520
''This year, the winning sorority
must embody diversification.''

96
00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:39.360
ln other words, geeks, nerds,
scientists--everybody.

97
00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:44.440
Problem solved.

98
00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:46.480
We'll just pledge some geeks.

99
00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:48.720
We will?

100
00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:53.800
And when we win the magazine
cover, let the fun begin.

101
00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:59.000
Gamma Gamma Girl group hug!

102
00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:00.520
All right, that's enough.

103
00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:01.760
l like the love...

104
00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:04.040
but let's not get all Ellen
DeGeneres about it, okay?

105
00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:15.840
lt's so good.

106
00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:25.640
- Kristen?
- Gloria.

107
00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:28.560
Hi. What are you doing here?

108
00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:30.160
Surprise!

109
00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:32.520
- Mr. Haas.
- Oh, hey, Gloria.

110
00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:34.480
- Hi.
- How are you? Nice to see you.

111
00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:35.560
Whoo!

112
00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:36.960
How are you doing?

113
00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:38.400
- l'm great.
- What is this?

114
00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:40.800
Well, l ran into Gloria's mom a
while back, and she mentioned...

115
00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:43.280
she was coming to South Beach,
so l made a few phone calls...

116
00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:45.960
and we arranged for
you two to live together.

117
00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:48.880
- Bingo!
- Wow, thanks, dad.

118
00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:51.440
- Yeah, unexpected.
- Full of surprises.

119
00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:53.520
Well, l know what good
friends you two are.

120
00:06:53.640 --> 00:06:55.920
- Were.
- Like, in the ninth grade.

121
00:06:56.040 --> 00:06:57.440
You two get reacquainted...

122
00:06:57.520 --> 00:06:59.440
l'll go get the rest
of the bags, okay?

123
00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:04.280
- Sure.
- l'll be right back.

124
00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:07.800
Are you sure this is
what you really want?

125
00:07:07.880 --> 00:07:10.240
l don't understand why you
have to live in the dorms...

126
00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:12.080
when we live in Coral Gables.

127
00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:14.080
Oh, you don't understand.

128
00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:16.920
'Cause l don't understand why
you had to park your car...

129
00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:19.000
in someone else's garage.

130
00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:21.000
And by car, l mean cock.

131
00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:23.200
- Mommy, what's a--
- It's a rooster, honey.

132
00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:27.280
Kathy, what do you
want me to say?

133
00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:28.720
l keep telling you l'm sorry.

134
00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:31.120
Yeah, you're sorry all right--
a sorry excuse for a husband.

135
00:07:31.240 --> 00:07:33.800
Kids, mommy's going
away to college.

136
00:07:33.880 --> 00:07:35.200
And you know why?

137
00:07:35.280 --> 00:07:38.240
Daddy decided to sleep with some
little tramp from his office!

138
00:07:38.320 --> 00:07:39.960
Well, see you Thanksgiving.

139
00:07:40.040 --> 00:07:42.360
- Bye, kids.
- Bye. Love you.

140
00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:47.080
Hey, football, huh?
Anybody up for a gangbang?

141
00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:48.920
Kathy, Jesus Christ!

142
00:07:52.360 --> 00:07:53.320
- Victoria.

143
00:07:53.400 --> 00:07:55.920
- Baby Dick, l missed
you so much.

144
00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.640
Not as much as l missed you,
my little English muffin.

145
00:08:05.080 --> 00:08:07.320
This is my new
boyfriend in training.

146
00:08:07.400 --> 00:08:09.120
He's already progressed
to week three.

147
00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:10.160
Wow.

148
00:08:10.280 --> 00:08:15.280
And, ladies, he's my property,
so hands and eyes off.

149
00:08:15.360 --> 00:08:18.000
Well, you can look.

150
00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:20.280
Now go and be a good boy,
and go get my luggage.

151
00:08:20.360 --> 00:08:22.120
lt's been on the sidewalk
for ten minutes.

152
00:08:22.200 --> 00:08:23.480
Right away, princess.

153
00:08:23.600 --> 00:08:28.840
Oh, and Baby D?
Gamsie needs to go potty.

154
00:08:28.920 --> 00:08:30.920
Okay.

155
00:08:33.840 --> 00:08:35.240
Thanks, bitch.

156
00:08:39.560 --> 00:08:42.040
Hi there! l'm Kathy!

157
00:08:42.120 --> 00:08:45.120
l'm your roommate!

158
00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:47.360
Well, come here, you!

159
00:08:47.440 --> 00:08:50.040
Oh, it is so good to meet you.

160
00:08:50.160 --> 00:08:54.360
We are gonna be
BFF, you and me.

161
00:08:54.480 --> 00:08:57.920
- Maxine. Nice to meet you.
- Ooh, who's the hottie?

162
00:08:58.040 --> 00:09:01.200
- That's my daddy.
- Dirty son of a bitch.

163
00:09:01.320 --> 00:09:04.360
Hey, roomie, do you know where
l could find some pot?

164
00:09:04.480 --> 00:09:06.080
- No.
- Ludes?

165
00:09:06.160 --> 00:09:08.600
- No.
- Meth? Lsd? Pcp? Crack rocks?

166
00:09:08.680 --> 00:09:09.760
No!

167
00:09:09.880 --> 00:09:11.920
Well, looks like l'm gonna
have to kick it old school.

168
00:09:14.520 --> 00:09:15.920
Ugh!

169
00:09:20.640 --> 00:09:24.120
- Here, let me help you unpack.
- No, not that bag!

170
00:09:25.160 --> 00:09:29.680
Hey, good idea. Sugar buzz!

171
00:09:35.280 --> 00:09:38.280
This fool's lucky he didn't
walk into Gamma.

172
00:09:38.400 --> 00:09:40.600
His pee-pee would've
Ieft on a stretcher.

173
00:09:40.680 --> 00:09:42.680
Don't forget to call every night.

174
00:09:42.760 --> 00:09:44.520
l promise, Mom. Goodbye.

175
00:09:46.920 --> 00:09:49.400
Keep an eye on that girl.
l think she might be disturbed.

176
00:09:49.480 --> 00:09:51.360
Mom!

177
00:09:51.480 --> 00:09:53.480
l'm so sorry about that.

178
00:09:53.600 --> 00:09:55.920
You know what moms are like.

179
00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:59.120
Yeah. Drunks with guns.

180
00:09:59.200 --> 00:10:02.960
- l'm Babs.
- Tonya.

181
00:10:05.080 --> 00:10:07.360
Open!

182
00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:10.440
Um, hi there. l think we
found your roommate.

183
00:10:10.520 --> 00:10:13.360
Yeah, we can't pronounce her
name. It sounds very exotic.

184
00:10:13.480 --> 00:10:18.240
- Uh, Senagarvar--
- Senagarvarapoopoo Ghandasini.

185
00:10:18.360 --> 00:10:20.720
Oh, PooPoo! That's cute.

186
00:10:20.800 --> 00:10:24.480
Very nice to make the
acquaintance to you.

187
00:10:24.560 --> 00:10:26.640
'Sup? Monique. l like your style.

188
00:10:26.720 --> 00:10:29.040
Hi, l'm Maxine.
'Sup, Maxine?

189
00:10:29.120 --> 00:10:31.480
l'm Kathy, and l like to party.

190
00:10:31.560 --> 00:10:34.240
Good to know.
l'm here studying music.

191
00:10:34.360 --> 00:10:35.640
Word, homey.

192
00:10:35.760 --> 00:10:37.320
l'm just here to get even
with my husband.

193
00:10:37.400 --> 00:10:40.120
l'm gonna nail as many
guys as possible.

194
00:10:40.240 --> 00:10:43.640
l'm just here for general
studies, for now.

195
00:10:43.760 --> 00:10:46.480
Hey, you girls wanna check
out my new boob job?

196
00:10:46.600 --> 00:10:49.400
Doctor says they should
realign themselves...

197
00:10:49.480 --> 00:10:51.560
and the scarring should go
down in a few months.

198
00:10:51.680 --> 00:10:55.520
l'm sure to land some man meat
with these milk bags, huh?

199
00:10:55.640 --> 00:11:00.000
When living together, blondes
and brunettes will always fight.

200
00:11:00.120 --> 00:11:04.600
You look a lot different than
the last time l saw you.

201
00:11:04.720 --> 00:11:06.720
My solution? Let the blonde win.

202
00:11:06.840 --> 00:11:08.400
No, l mean you look good.

203
00:11:08.520 --> 00:11:09.760
Yeah.

204
00:11:09.840 --> 00:11:13.200
Listen, let's just be clear.

205
00:11:13.320 --> 00:11:15.120
We're not in ninth grade
anymore, okay?

206
00:11:15.240 --> 00:11:17.320
We're different people now.
At least l am.

207
00:11:17.400 --> 00:11:20.320
So let's not pretend we're gonna
be college buddies, okay?

208
00:11:20.400 --> 00:11:22.080
Just because you got yourself
some new clothes,

209
00:11:22.200 --> 00:11:24.480
and bleached your teeth,
and fixed your nose.

210
00:11:24.600 --> 00:11:26.400
l didn't get my nose fixed!

211
00:11:28.640 --> 00:11:29.880
God!

212
00:11:36.240 --> 00:11:37.640
Level-one, level-two,
Ievel-three, level-four.

213
00:11:37.720 --> 00:11:40.080
One, two, three, four.

214
00:11:40.160 --> 00:11:42.320
How many Red Bulls
did she drink?

215
00:11:42.440 --> 00:11:44.360
About the same as
me--nine or ten.

216
00:11:44.440 --> 00:11:46.600
One, two, three, four.

217
00:11:46.720 --> 00:11:48.840
One, two, three, four.

218
00:11:48.960 --> 00:11:50.360
One--ooh!

219
00:11:55.240 --> 00:11:57.400
No-no-no-no-no-no! PooPoo.

220
00:11:57.480 --> 00:12:01.400
No, honey. That's a vibrator.

221
00:12:01.520 --> 00:12:03.160
Without my guidance...

222
00:12:03.240 --> 00:12:06.160
girls look for love in
all the wrong places.

223
00:12:06.240 --> 00:12:09.040
lt's called the Platapussy.

224
00:12:09.120 --> 00:12:11.440
What is a Platapussy, please?

225
00:12:11.520 --> 00:12:12.920
Well... No-no-no.

226
00:12:13.040 --> 00:12:16.520
lt's okay, it won't hurt you.

227
00:12:16.600 --> 00:12:18.440
Who thinks it's time for PooPoo

228
00:12:18.520 --> 00:12:20.520
to meet her special little friend?

229
00:12:20.640 --> 00:12:23.560
- Ooh, l do.
- Right here.

230
00:12:23.680 --> 00:12:27.360
Well, it is an important
American tradition.

231
00:12:27.440 --> 00:12:29.200
Come on, sweetie.

232
00:12:29.280 --> 00:12:30.920
- Bye!
- Bye!

233
00:12:31.040 --> 00:12:34.800
- Bye.
- Have a good time!

234
00:12:34.880 --> 00:12:38.400
No! No! No!

235
00:12:38.520 --> 00:12:41.040
Going at it like a little
hamster in there.

236
00:12:41.120 --> 00:12:46.440
- Yes! Yes! Oh! Oh!
- Poo! Poo! Poo! Poo! Poo!

237
00:12:46.520 --> 00:12:47.880
USA!

238
00:12:47.960 --> 00:12:49.640
Oh! l love this country.

239
00:12:49.720 --> 00:12:53.160
Oh! Ah, ah, ah!

240
00:12:53.280 --> 00:12:54.760
Go, America!

241
00:12:59.840 --> 00:13:02.680
l like this new
American Tradition.

242
00:13:14.520 --> 00:13:17.600
Let's check those
bad boys out.

243
00:13:17.680 --> 00:13:19.600
- Ready?
- Oh, yeah.

244
00:13:21.760 --> 00:13:23.480
Look over here.

245
00:13:37.120 --> 00:13:40.640
A time-honored college tradition
is ignoring the three-way...

246
00:13:40.760 --> 00:13:43.000
in the bathroom
stall behind you.

247
00:13:43.080 --> 00:13:46.520
How much does he wish these
lips were in that stall with him?

248
00:13:54.720 --> 00:13:57.560
What are you doing?

249
00:13:57.640 --> 00:14:00.920
My dog is such a perv.
l love it.

250
00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:02.680
Mmm. Now l'm craving sushi.

251
00:14:02.760 --> 00:14:04.240
Moshi Moshi.

252
00:14:14.320 --> 00:14:15.320
Paging Plumber Jones.

253
00:14:15.440 --> 00:14:16.760
Plumber Jones.

254
00:14:16.880 --> 00:14:20.160
What is the problem? Over.

255
00:14:20.240 --> 00:14:22.480
There's a pipe blockage
in the girl's bathroom.

256
00:14:22.600 --> 00:14:24.360
We need you to
go check it out.

257
00:14:24.440 --> 00:14:25.640
This problem is solved.

258
00:14:25.720 --> 00:14:27.600
Signing off.

259
00:14:27.680 --> 00:14:32.480
Son, l realize you always wanted
to be a plumber like your old man.

260
00:14:32.560 --> 00:14:37.800
As long as people remain full of
shit, we'll have job security.

261
00:14:37.920 --> 00:14:39.000
Stay here.

262
00:14:44.280 --> 00:14:45.440
l'm coming!

263
00:14:49.080 --> 00:14:50.680
lt's a lovely smile, isn't it?

264
00:14:50.800 --> 00:14:53.280
Now, cleanliness is
next to godliness.

265
00:14:53.360 --> 00:14:55.880
l have been supervisor of this
dorm for over 27 years...

266
00:14:55.960 --> 00:14:58.480
and l take personal pride in
maintaining a sanitary

267
00:14:58.600 --> 00:15:00.280
and a wholesome environment.

268
00:15:00.360 --> 00:15:02.760
The rules of the dormitory
are very simple.

269
00:15:02.880 --> 00:15:05.200
One: Although this is
a coed college...

270
00:15:05.320 --> 00:15:07.520
this is not a coed dormitory.

271
00:15:07.640 --> 00:15:09.920
Any sexual touching
is forbidden.

272
00:15:10.040 --> 00:15:13.160
Two: a good student
is a clean student...

273
00:15:13.280 --> 00:15:15.320
and that must be reflected
in their environment.

274
00:15:17.080 --> 00:15:18.640
What is wrong with you?

275
00:15:18.720 --> 00:15:21.600
l gotta pee so bad my
back teeth are floating.

276
00:15:21.720 --> 00:15:23.120
Lucky there's a
potty right here.

277
00:15:23.200 --> 00:15:24.880
Hurry. We don't
want any accidents.

278
00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:27.760
Sit on the paper if
you are going to sit.

279
00:15:43.160 --> 00:15:45.440
l think she needs
more toilet paper.

280
00:15:45.560 --> 00:15:46.440
Help!

281
00:15:46.560 --> 00:15:49.000
Go, go! Hurry!

282
00:15:49.080 --> 00:15:50.600
l'm going down the gurgler.

283
00:15:50.680 --> 00:15:52.520
Grab her legs.

284
00:15:52.600 --> 00:15:54.840
Just hold on.

285
00:15:54.960 --> 00:15:56.640
l don't want to die.

286
00:15:56.720 --> 00:15:59.800
Oh, sweet Jesus, do not
Iet me die in here.

287
00:16:03.720 --> 00:16:06.360
l'm stuck, and the
toilet's eating me.

288
00:16:08.560 --> 00:16:12.280
- Can you please hurry up?
- We're gonna get you outta there.

289
00:16:12.360 --> 00:16:13.560
You hang on.

290
00:16:19.520 --> 00:16:21.000
Oh, no!

291
00:16:21.080 --> 00:16:23.280
lt's a 10.2 on the shitter scale!

292
00:16:23.360 --> 00:16:24.880
lt's never gone this high before!

293
00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:27.120
l have no idea what that means.

294
00:16:28.880 --> 00:16:34.000
Everybody run!

295
00:16:34.120 --> 00:16:35.800
What the hell is wrong
with that man?

296
00:16:35.880 --> 00:16:38.320
Get down!

297
00:16:41.640 --> 00:16:42.840
Oh, shit!

298
00:16:46.200 --> 00:16:47.800
Oh, my god!

299
00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:04.240
l am closing down
this dormitory.

300
00:17:04.360 --> 00:17:07.280
All of you get out!

301
00:17:13.800 --> 00:17:17.960
lt's just like when l used to live
next to the methane plant.

302
00:17:18.080 --> 00:17:19.920
Please step back. We just had
a plumbing emergency....

303
00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:22.360
causing the fat girl
to go sky high.

304
00:17:22.440 --> 00:17:24.680
Strangely we found a
Dolce & Gabbana top...

305
00:17:24.800 --> 00:17:26.040
stuffed down the pipes.

306
00:17:26.120 --> 00:17:27.280
Holy shit.

307
00:17:27.360 --> 00:17:28.560
This stuff happens all the time.

308
00:17:28.680 --> 00:17:29.680
There's nothing to see here.

309
00:17:29.760 --> 00:17:31.640
School'll take care of
all your bathroom needs.

310
00:17:31.720 --> 00:17:33.640
Why does it smell
like hot ass?

311
00:17:33.720 --> 00:17:36.160
That would be the
gas escaping.

312
00:17:36.240 --> 00:17:38.160
So where are we gonna
stay 'til it gets fixed?

313
00:17:38.240 --> 00:17:40.280
School has arranged
for housing vouchers.

314
00:17:40.360 --> 00:17:43.320
l can't believe the school is
only giving us _200 a month.

315
00:17:43.400 --> 00:17:46.120
You can't even get a
cardboard box for that.

316
00:17:46.200 --> 00:17:48.080
What if we pool all our money?

317
00:17:48.160 --> 00:17:51.720
Don't look at me, guys. l'm still
saving up for ass implants.

318
00:17:51.840 --> 00:17:55.000
There's nothing affordable unless
you commute from the swamp.

319
00:17:55.080 --> 00:17:56.760
Hey, girls.

320
00:17:56.840 --> 00:17:58.600
What about a sorority?

321
00:17:58.680 --> 00:18:01.840
Hey, great idea. A sorority.

322
00:18:01.920 --> 00:18:03.800
That's like flypaper
for horny guys.

323
00:18:03.880 --> 00:18:05.120
Yeah.

324
00:18:05.200 --> 00:18:06.640
lf we all did it
together, it'd be fun.

325
00:18:06.760 --> 00:18:07.840
l don't know, Max.

326
00:18:07.920 --> 00:18:10.640
l don't think l'm really down
with the whole sorority thing.

327
00:18:10.720 --> 00:18:15.080
Aren't sororities supposed to be
about friendships and bonding?

328
00:18:15.200 --> 00:18:17.600
We could at least check it out.

329
00:18:17.720 --> 00:18:21.120
lt's either that or a commute
from the swamp.

330
00:18:21.200 --> 00:18:23.600
There are so many
temptations out there...

331
00:18:23.680 --> 00:18:26.360
like drugs, alcohol, and boys.

332
00:18:26.440 --> 00:18:29.200
l'd like to introduce you
to a different kind of boy.

333
00:18:29.280 --> 00:18:30.800
l think you're really
gonna like him.

334
00:18:30.920 --> 00:18:33.520
He's smart, he's funny,
and he's really cool.

335
00:18:33.600 --> 00:18:34.800
The coolest.

336
00:18:34.920 --> 00:18:37.680
His name is Jesus, and he just
wants to hang with you guys.

337
00:18:37.800 --> 00:18:40.040
Welcome to Kappa!

338
00:18:42.960 --> 00:18:45.840
Can l ask a question?

339
00:18:45.960 --> 00:18:47.560
Was he circumcised?

340
00:18:47.680 --> 00:18:49.760
l mean, he's a Jew,
but he's a Christian.

341
00:18:49.840 --> 00:18:51.320
What's the deal with that?

342
00:18:55.800 --> 00:18:57.800
No, l, uh...

343
00:19:00.520 --> 00:19:02.760
Very nice to meet you.

344
00:19:02.840 --> 00:19:04.240
They're dykes.

345
00:19:05.800 --> 00:19:08.080
l love curry fish.

346
00:19:08.160 --> 00:19:11.480
l think we've taken up enough
of these ladies' valuable time.

347
00:19:11.600 --> 00:19:15.080
Where you going?
We're gonna play spin the bottle!

348
00:19:15.200 --> 00:19:17.360
You guys can pledge if you want.

349
00:19:17.480 --> 00:19:19.080
We only have one rule.

350
00:19:19.160 --> 00:19:22.520
lf you're gonna kill yourselves,
make sure you tell us in advance.

351
00:19:22.600 --> 00:19:24.640
So we can plan the party.

352
00:19:24.760 --> 00:19:26.880
Yeah.

353
00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:29.720
Love what you've
done with the place.

354
00:19:29.800 --> 00:19:32.760
Very cozy.

355
00:19:32.840 --> 00:19:37.280
Once you cross the doors at Phi
Iota Gamma, you will never again

356
00:19:37.400 --> 00:19:40.480
have to worry about what to
wear in order to be accepted.

357
00:19:43.240 --> 00:19:44.760
Big hug!

358
00:19:44.880 --> 00:19:47.240
Oh, my god.

359
00:19:47.360 --> 00:19:48.960
We're so out of here.

360
00:19:49.040 --> 00:19:50.560
No, girls., come back.

361
00:19:50.680 --> 00:19:53.160
Please. The sisterhood needs you.

362
00:20:14.120 --> 00:20:16.200
#  One, two, three four #

363
00:20:16.280 --> 00:20:19.640
#  l did something last night
that you don't know #

364
00:20:19.760 --> 00:20:22.040
Hey, it's the madman.

365
00:20:22.120 --> 00:20:24.280

You're going.
Don't say nothing, all right?

368
00:20:29.320 --> 00:20:32.320
You know l'm gonna
sign that check, dog.

369
00:20:35.600 --> 00:20:37.560
Check you later, dude.

370
00:20:37.680 --> 00:20:40.840
#  If only l could tell you
one, two, three, four #

371
00:20:40.920 --> 00:20:42.880
Oh, snap!

372
00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:44.440
Rappers!

373
00:20:44.560 --> 00:20:45.960
Chicks love rappers, right?

374
00:20:46.040 --> 00:20:48.040
Yeah, yeah. In those videos
they always got bitches.

375
00:20:48.160 --> 00:20:49.520
Bitches and hoes.

376
00:20:49.600 --> 00:20:50.480
Check this out.

377
00:20:50.600 --> 00:20:52.480
Yo, yo, you're cold.
You're old.

378

Your mom's got mold. Her teeth

That didn't rhyme.

00:20:58.840 --> 00:21:00.440

but it's gonna be good.

00:21:00.520 --> 00:21:01.240
Yeah.

382
00:21:02.720 --> 00:21:05.160
What's crackin' there, baby?
We're in South Beach...

383
00:21:05.280 --> 00:21:08.600
where it's so hot the girls
get undressed naturally.

384
00:21:16.240 --> 00:21:17.880
l was thinking about
taking a swim...

385
00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:20.800
but now i'll have to drain
and disinfect the pool.

386
00:21:24.360 --> 00:21:25.480

388
00:21:28.360 --> 00:21:30.000
Oh, my God.

389
00:21:30.120 --> 00:21:33.880
l know for a fact that

390
00:21:33.960 --> 00:21:36.040
She's so beautiful.

391
00:21:36.160 --> 00:21:38.520
l'm gonna pull a muscle if l
have to keep smiling like this.

392
00:21:38.640 --> 00:21:40.760
l heard her dad
is a billionaire.

393
00:21:40.840 --> 00:21:42.800
l heard her dad bought France.

394
00:21:42.920 --> 00:21:45.160
Have you seen her boyfriend?
He's hot.

395
00:21:48.280 --> 00:21:50.960

396
00:21:51.080 --> 00:21:52.800
Who let that loser in here?

This is embarrassing.

401
00:22:01.960 --> 00:22:05.480
lf l was a real queen, l'd have
that dickless wonder beheaded.

402
00:22:05.600 --> 00:22:08.120
Speaking of dickless.

403
00:22:08.240 --> 00:22:10.000
Why do you have always
have to bring Dax here?

404
00:22:10.080 --> 00:22:11.320
Baby.

405
00:22:11.440 --> 00:22:13.280
Princess.

406
00:22:13.400 --> 00:22:15.120
Dax is my boy.

407
00:22:15.200 --> 00:22:19.600
We go way back, like... car seats.

408
00:22:19.680 --> 00:22:22.120
That is so corny.

409
00:22:22.200 --> 00:22:23.880
Where you going?

410
00:22:23.960 --> 00:22:25.960

And keep my public waiting?

416
00:22:38.360 --> 00:22:39.840
Unlikely, Derek.

417
00:22:39.960 --> 00:22:41.240
Come on, baby.

418
00:22:41.320 --> 00:22:43.160
We haven't hooked

419
00:22:43.240 --> 00:22:45.840
My balls miss your chin.

420
00:22:54.120 --> 00:22:57.040
You know l can't
resist Little Derek.

421
00:22:57.160 --> 00:22:58.600
Little?

422
00:22:58.720 --> 00:23:00.960
Tiny. Like a baby's dick.

423
00:23:01.040 --> 00:23:03.120
Who's your baby dick?

424
00:23:03.240 --> 00:23:04.520

Oh, baby, you're

Oh, Hell no.

00:23:35.280 --> 00:23:40.320
Baby, you're bringing
out the freak in me.

434
00:23:40.400 --> 00:23:43.840
You be a good little boy
and keep your eyes closed.

if you know what l'm sayin'.

436

Baby.

00:24:07.080 --> 00:24:09.360
Oh, god! Feels so good.

446
00:24:11.200 --> 00:24:12.840
You're an animal.

447
00:24:12.960 --> 00:24:14.240
Whoo!

00:25:27.080 --> 00:25:28.520
Oh, yeah.

How's your girl? l

l heard they've got a fine cocker
spaniel at the Kappa house.

498
00:26:17.160 --> 00:26:18.120
And you know what?

499
00:26:18.240 --> 00:26:22.040
She likes it ruff!

500
00:26:22.120 --> 00:26:25.200
Say, we're just doggin' with ya.

501
00:26:25.280 --> 00:26:27.400

'Cause at the end of the
day, l still got Victoria,

503
00:26:30.320 --> 00:26:32.880
and you got fingered by
Father Mulrooney.

504
00:26:35.440 --> 00:26:37.000
Fuck you!

505
00:26:37.080 --> 00:26:39.000
Bro, you gotta leave
your past behind.

506
00:26:40.320 --> 00:26:41.920
That was interesting.

507
00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:44.360
Top o' the mornin' to ya!

508
00:26:44.440 --> 00:26:46.880
l'm an exchange student
from the Emerald Isle.

509
00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:48.200
You're from Ireland?

510
00:26:48.320 --> 00:26:50.240
Aye! That l am--from Ireland.

511
00:26:50.360 --> 00:26:52.040
That's such a coincidence.
She's from Ireland, too.

512
00:26:52.160 --> 00:26:54.760
That's right.
l'm from Galway.

513
00:26:54.880 --> 00:26:56.640
Where you hail from?

514
00:26:56.720 --> 00:27:02.200
Uh, l'm from, uh,
South... Middle Earth.

515
00:27:02.320 --> 00:27:04.120
Nice try, Frodo.

516
00:27:04.200 --> 00:27:05.360

00:27:05.440 --> 00:27:06.520
Wait!

518
00:27:06.640 --> 00:27:07.560
Don't leave yet.

519
00:27:07.680 --> 00:27:09.160
Don't you want to
taste my shillaley?

520
00:27:09.240 --> 00:27:10.520
You're disgustin'.

521
00:27:10.640 --> 00:27:13.960
When l look around this class of
talented students, what do l see?

522
00:27:14.080 --> 00:27:18.480
l see a future of Dolce's,
Gabbana's, Chloe's and Prada's.

523
00:27:18.600 --> 00:27:21.360
lf l wanted to get an
''A'' in fashion class,

524
00:27:21.480 --> 00:27:23.640
l would have walked in naked.

525
00:27:23.720 --> 00:27:30.240
This slow motion helps, so you
can get a good look, you pervs.

526
00:27:30.320 --> 00:27:33.080
So sorry l'm late, Lisa.

527
00:27:33.160 --> 00:27:35.880
The lady doing my
pedicure took forever.

528
00:27:35.960 --> 00:27:38.400
Hi, Victoria. We were just
discussing your work.

529
00:27:40.960 --> 00:27:44.000
- Nice job as always.
- Thank you.

530
00:27:44.080 --> 00:27:48.040
However, l was especially
impressed by the freshness

531
00:27:48.160 --> 00:27:50.280
of this designer's work.

532
00:27:55.320 --> 00:27:57.600
Are those clothes for Muppets?

533
00:27:57.680 --> 00:28:03.040
Now who may l say is
responsible for these?

534
00:28:03.160 --> 00:28:06.400
Gloria Torres.

535
00:28:09.880 --> 00:28:11.760
Great job, Gloria.

536
00:28:11.840 --> 00:28:13.560
Thanks.

537
00:28:13.680 --> 00:28:17.680
Note to self: fire design team.

538
00:28:17.760 --> 00:28:19.920
Check out these freshman.
They're so hot.

539
00:28:20.040 --> 00:28:21.680
Cut it out, man.
You're gonna get me in trouble.

540
00:28:21.800 --> 00:28:23.040
What happened to you, man?

541
00:28:23.120 --> 00:28:24.400
What ever happened to the guy
that fucked Denise Reynolds

542
00:28:24.520 --> 00:28:26.160
in front of her grandparents?

543
00:28:26.280 --> 00:28:27.760
l miss that guy.

544
00:28:27.840 --> 00:28:29.600
l'm still here.

545
00:28:29.720 --> 00:28:31.960
Ugh. Shoot.

546
00:28:32.040 --> 00:28:34.040
Damn.

547
00:28:34.160 --> 00:28:35.400
That's hot.

548
00:28:37.480 --> 00:28:39.160
Damn.

549
00:28:39.240 --> 00:28:40.840
- Think she's hot?
- Who?

550
00:28:40.920 --> 00:28:42.560
That Mexican broad
you were staring at.

551
00:28:42.680 --> 00:28:44.800
Actually, l think
she's Portuguese.

552
00:28:44.880 --> 00:28:46.800
Shut the fuck up, Dax!

553
00:28:46.880 --> 00:28:49.680
And you... you stay
away from that bitch.

554
00:28:54.600 --> 00:28:56.800
Bye.

555
00:28:56.880 --> 00:29:00.640
Daddy, darling, will you do Queen
Victoria the hugest favor?

556
00:29:00.720 --> 00:29:03.040
l need my fashion design
teacher killed.

557
00:29:03.120 --> 00:29:04.880
Oh, really?

558
00:29:04.960 --> 00:29:07.600
Well then l want that
fucking bitch fired.

559
00:29:07.680 --> 00:29:08.920
Thank you, Daddy.

560
00:29:09.040 --> 00:29:10.320
l love you.

561
00:29:10.400 --> 00:29:12.640
#  Back home #

562
00:29:12.760 --> 00:29:14.400
#  Back home #

563
00:29:14.520 --> 00:29:15.840
You know what, girls?

564
00:29:15.920 --> 00:29:18.280
There is one place that
we haven't tried yet.

565
00:29:23.760 --> 00:29:25.240
Wow.

566
00:29:28.760 --> 00:29:30.240
Gamma Gamma.

567
00:29:30.320 --> 00:29:33.440
Damn, It looks like
some MTV crib shit.

568
00:29:33.560 --> 00:29:35.120
My cooter's tingling.

569
00:29:35.200 --> 00:29:38.480
l think there might
be boys in there.

570
00:29:38.560 --> 00:29:40.360
We need to get a door guy.

571
00:29:40.440 --> 00:29:42.840
Better yet, a human bug zapper.

572
00:29:42.960 --> 00:29:45.840
Oh, my God, that dress is so hot.

573
00:29:45.960 --> 00:29:47.000
Thank you.

574
00:29:47.120 --> 00:29:49.160
That must have cost
hundreds of dollars.

575
00:29:49.240 --> 00:29:51.200
Try thousands of hundreds.

576
00:29:51.280 --> 00:29:54.280
So don't go looking for
it in any Sears catalog.

577
00:29:54.360 --> 00:29:56.520
That's what l meant.

578
00:29:56.600 --> 00:29:58.520
Thousands... hundreds.

579
00:30:00.200 --> 00:30:02.840
Oh, Morgan.

580
00:30:02.920 --> 00:30:06.240
We'd like to pledge
your sorority, please.

581
00:30:06.320 --> 00:30:09.440
lf it's not too much trouble,
l'd like a room with a bidet.

582
00:30:09.560 --> 00:30:13.040
Could you guys hold
on for a second?

583
00:30:13.120 --> 00:30:16.920
l think she likes us.

584
00:30:17.040 --> 00:30:22.960
Someone left a mess on our front
door, and it wants to pledge.

585
00:30:26.640 --> 00:30:29.560
Look at this place.
It's just heaven on earth.

586
00:30:29.640 --> 00:30:32.200
And it's so pink.

587
00:30:32.320 --> 00:30:35.640
We could have one hell
of an orgy in here, gals.

588
00:30:35.720 --> 00:30:37.720
What do you think, girls?

589
00:30:37.840 --> 00:30:40.960
Are they Gamma material?

590
00:30:41.080 --> 00:30:43.040
l think we should let them pledge.

591
00:30:43.160 --> 00:30:44.800
- And you are?
- Kristen.

592
00:30:44.920 --> 00:30:47.280
Kristen Haas.

593
00:30:47.360 --> 00:30:51.120
And why do you think we should
Iet them pledge, Kristen _ss?

594
00:30:51.200 --> 00:30:57.400
Because, um... because they
could be our diversity.

595
00:30:57.520 --> 00:30:58.920
Hot.

596
00:30:59.040 --> 00:31:00.600
She's right.

597
00:31:00.680 --> 00:31:03.280
Gamma's about acceptance
and individuality.

598
00:31:03.400 --> 00:31:04.880
Who are we to discriminate?

599
00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:06.440
Bring them in.

600
00:31:06.560 --> 00:31:07.840
Good idea, Kristen Haas.

601
00:31:07.960 --> 00:31:09.880
Nice hair.

602
00:31:09.960 --> 00:31:12.000
Yeah, thanks. Shut the door.

603
00:31:12.120 --> 00:31:15.960
Morgan, can you get the girls
some champagne, please?

604
00:31:20.920 --> 00:31:23.040
l'd like to lick her all over.

605
00:31:23.160 --> 00:31:24.960
l heard about your
housing situation.

606
00:31:25.040 --> 00:31:27.360
lt's so unfortunate.

607
00:31:27.440 --> 00:31:32.800
And that's why we'd like
to offer you an early bid.

608
00:31:32.880 --> 00:31:35.880
Normally we don't let
pledges move right in...

609
00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:39.360
but in your case, l think we're
gonna make an exception.

610
00:31:39.440 --> 00:31:41.840
Why don't you girls go
check out the house.

611
00:31:41.920 --> 00:31:43.680
Let us know by the
end of the night.

612
00:31:52.800 --> 00:31:54.200
l don't know.

613
00:31:54.280 --> 00:31:56.560
You guys really think this
place is right for us?

614
00:31:56.680 --> 00:31:57.920
Are you kidding me?

615
00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:00.520
This is the most beautiful
place l ever seen.

616
00:32:00.640 --> 00:32:03.200
lts beauty puts the
Taj Mahal to shame.

617
00:32:03.280 --> 00:32:05.480
- All right?
- All right. Fuck it.

618
00:32:05.600 --> 00:32:07.320
l'm in.

619
00:32:07.400 --> 00:32:09.440
This place is insane!

620
00:32:14.880 --> 00:32:17.400
Have you ladies come
to a decision yet?

621
00:32:17.520 --> 00:32:18.840
l think we're in!

622
00:32:18.920 --> 00:32:20.480
Welcome to gamma.

623
00:32:20.600 --> 00:32:22.600
Why don't you guys get
changed for dinner?

624
00:32:22.680 --> 00:32:26.000
With their diversity, we
can win the FHM contest.

625
00:32:26.120 --> 00:32:28.240
But they'll never be
Gamma Gammas.

626
00:32:28.360 --> 00:32:31.040
That was a great idea, Kristen.

627
00:32:31.120 --> 00:32:33.200
And if the freak show
make it through hell week?

628
00:32:33.320 --> 00:32:35.080
You're in.

629
00:32:35.160 --> 00:32:36.680
Wait!

630
00:32:36.800 --> 00:32:38.240
l thought l already was in.

631
00:32:38.320 --> 00:32:39.400
Good luck.

632
00:32:39.520 --> 00:32:42.880
Wait. Wait. Wait.

633
00:32:42.960 --> 00:32:45.760
So you tried the rapper
thing, the jackass thing.

634
00:32:45.840 --> 00:32:47.280
- Nothing worked?
- Nothing.

635
00:32:47.360 --> 00:32:49.080
l really liked that Irish thing.
That was good.

636
00:32:49.200 --> 00:32:51.160
l liked it, too. l just don't get it.

637
00:32:51.240 --> 00:32:54.160
- Maybe l'm ugly.
- No.

638
00:32:54.240 --> 00:32:55.800
A little.

639
00:32:55.920 --> 00:32:57.600
l think she's the one.

640
00:32:57.720 --> 00:32:59.760
What? Who's the one?

641
00:32:59.840 --> 00:33:01.120
Victoria, dick.

642
00:33:01.200 --> 00:33:02.520
Victoria? No, man.

643
00:33:02.640 --> 00:33:04.840
- She's the hottest girl in school.
- She's the craziest girl in school.

644
00:33:04.920 --> 00:33:06.120
Yeah, crazy for me.

645
00:33:06.240 --> 00:33:08.360
Yeah, so crazy for you she
got her dog to blow you.

646
00:33:08.440 --> 00:33:09.400
She's sharing.

647
00:33:09.480 --> 00:33:11.000
So crazy for you that she
emptied your bank account...

648
00:33:11.080 --> 00:33:13.560
and bought a ticket for her
ex-boyfriend to visit her.

649
00:33:13.640 --> 00:33:15.480
They're friends.
l steal her panties.

650
00:33:15.560 --> 00:33:17.520
She puts pictures of
me on the internet.

651
00:33:17.600 --> 00:33:19.920
lt's a relationship.
It's a two way street, dick!

652
00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:21.240
l gotta go.

653
00:33:21.320 --> 00:33:23.120
Victoria's gonna let
me be on top this time.

654
00:33:31.480 --> 00:33:33.160
But there's only one bed.

655
00:33:33.240 --> 00:33:36.760
That's okay, because you ladies
will be sleeping in there.

656
00:33:38.960 --> 00:33:41.120
But don't worry, there's
plenty of room.

657
00:33:41.200 --> 00:33:42.760
Okay? l'll see you at dinner.

658
00:33:42.880 --> 00:33:44.200
- Bye.
- Bye.

659
00:33:50.960 --> 00:33:52.840
We are so flattered...

660
00:33:52.960 --> 00:33:54.680
that you all want to be
a part of Gamma Gamma.

661
00:33:54.800 --> 00:33:57.520
l think that Jackie Onassis
said it best when she said--

662
00:33:57.600 --> 00:33:58.840
Thanks, Morgan.

663
00:33:58.920 --> 00:34:00.760
l think we know what you mean.

664
00:34:00.840 --> 00:34:05.120
You pledges are our future,
and that's why it's important...

665
00:34:05.200 --> 00:34:07.360
you live up to the
highest of standards.

666
00:34:07.440 --> 00:34:12.200
Because we are the
hottest sorority eyer.

667
00:34:12.280 --> 00:34:15.560
So you're asking, if l keep
treating pledges like shit...

668
00:34:15.640 --> 00:34:17.200
won't they just leave?

669
00:34:17.320 --> 00:34:20.000
Will fat chicks ever stop
squeezing into low rise jeans?

670
00:34:20.120 --> 00:34:22.520
Will hairy chicks
ever stop waxing?

671
00:34:22.600 --> 00:34:24.400
No.

672
00:34:24.480 --> 00:34:27.720
The more l humiliate them, the
more they're gonna love me.

673
00:34:27.800 --> 00:34:29.320
Sick, huh?

674
00:34:33.120 --> 00:34:34.480
Gross.

675
00:34:34.560 --> 00:34:36.760
Be sure to lick your
bowls clean, girls.

676
00:34:36.880 --> 00:34:39.200
And don't use your hands.

677
00:34:39.280 --> 00:34:43.520
By the way, that's
not dog food.

678
00:34:43.600 --> 00:34:47.240
lt's yesterday's sushi.

679
00:34:47.320 --> 00:34:48.800
Eat up.

680
00:35:00.880 --> 00:35:03.440
Damn, Maxine, move over.

681
00:35:03.520 --> 00:35:04.880
l'm sorry.

682
00:35:04.960 --> 00:35:06.640
l'm just big boned is all.

683
00:35:06.720 --> 00:35:10.200
FYl, the ass is not a bone.

684
00:35:10.320 --> 00:35:13.480
Babs, would you please
stop rubbing my butt?

685
00:35:13.560 --> 00:35:15.560
l though that was my ass.

686
00:35:21.880 --> 00:35:23.720
Oh, yeah, baby.

687
00:35:23.840 --> 00:35:25.560
Oh, that's good.

688
00:35:25.640 --> 00:35:27.480
Suck on my titties.

689
00:35:29.800 --> 00:35:33.520
Someone seriously has to take
that thing away from her.

690
00:35:40.200 --> 00:35:43.840
Get up, get up,
get up, get up.

691
00:35:43.920 --> 00:35:46.800
Sleep is for gammas,
not pledges.

692
00:35:46.880 --> 00:35:51.080
Now, we have a little sexual
awareness exercise for you guys.

693
00:35:51.200 --> 00:35:53.480
Good morning.

694
00:35:53.600 --> 00:35:58.320
Gammas must learn all aspects of
condom use and proper disposal.

695
00:35:58.400 --> 00:35:59.760
How many of these
do we have to find?

696
00:35:59.840 --> 00:36:01.200
Just 50.

697
00:36:01.280 --> 00:36:03.320
And how many do we have?

698
00:36:03.400 --> 00:36:04.680
Three.

699
00:36:04.760 --> 00:36:06.200
Why don't we just buy
some condoms...

700
00:36:06.320 --> 00:36:08.840
and jerk off some
homeless guys?

701
00:36:08.920 --> 00:36:12.240
Like that didn't occur
to anyone else.

702
00:36:12.320 --> 00:36:13.840
l think l found one.

703
00:36:13.960 --> 00:36:15.040
Where?

704
00:36:15.120 --> 00:36:17.520
Ew. Get it off. Get it off!

705
00:36:17.600 --> 00:36:20.200
Wait! Poops don't lose that one!

706
00:36:20.280 --> 00:36:21.440
Wait! Stop!

707
00:36:21.520 --> 00:36:23.040
We need it! Get back!

708
00:36:36.920 --> 00:36:38.680
Excuse me. Uh, gays?

709
00:36:38.800 --> 00:36:41.120
You think we could
get your condom?

710
00:36:41.240 --> 00:36:44.520
You know, after?

711
00:36:44.600 --> 00:36:46.320
We'll bring you two, sweetie.

712
00:36:46.400 --> 00:36:48.240
Two!

713
00:36:48.320 --> 00:36:49.800
You got it.

714
00:37:08.640 --> 00:37:10.280
You almost gave
me a heart attack.

715
00:37:10.360 --> 00:37:12.320
Sorry.

716
00:37:12.440 --> 00:37:14.920
You're Derek, right?
Victoria's boyfriend.

717
00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:17.440
What the hell are you doing
here at 4:OO in the morning?

718
00:37:17.520 --> 00:37:19.320
We got in a fight.
She kicked me out.

719
00:37:19.440 --> 00:37:20.720
Well, that sucks.

720
00:37:20.800 --> 00:37:22.600
Happens all the time.

721
00:37:22.680 --> 00:37:24.200
She kicks me out, l come
Iay here for a while...

722
00:37:24.320 --> 00:37:25.880
and then l go to my room.

723
00:37:25.960 --> 00:37:27.400
Why do you take it?

724
00:37:27.520 --> 00:37:30.920
l guess l'm addicted and
Victoria's the drug.

725
00:37:31.040 --> 00:37:33.520
That is so refreshingly honest...

726
00:37:33.600 --> 00:37:36.120
and tear-jerkingly pathetic
at the same time.

727
00:37:36.240 --> 00:37:40.400
- Pathetic?
- At the same time.

728
00:37:40.480 --> 00:37:43.600
Not that l'm not enjoying
this conversation...

729
00:37:43.680 --> 00:37:44.920
with you or anything...

730
00:37:45.040 --> 00:37:46.960
but there's something about a
woman wearing rubber gloves...

731
00:37:47.040 --> 00:37:48.960
and carrying tongs at
four in the morning...

732
00:37:49.040 --> 00:37:51.400
that naturally scares
the shit out of a guy.

733
00:37:51.480 --> 00:37:54.480
Victoria has us pledges
collecting used condoms.

734
00:37:54.600 --> 00:37:55.880
Oh, right.

735
00:37:55.960 --> 00:37:57.800
That exercise she
likes to give.

736
00:37:57.920 --> 00:37:59.280
Any luck?

737
00:37:59.400 --> 00:38:01.080
No, not really.

738
00:38:01.160 --> 00:38:03.640
lt's not like l'm trying
all that hard, either.

739
00:38:03.720 --> 00:38:08.440
You know, l may be able to
help you out with this.

740
00:38:08.520 --> 00:38:11.880
- Excuse me?
- No, not like that.

741
00:38:11.960 --> 00:38:13.520
Just come with me.

742
00:38:13.600 --> 00:38:14.880
Wait a minute.
Where are you going?

743
00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:16.360
Just trust me. Come on.

744
00:38:16.440 --> 00:38:18.000
- l'm not gonna bite.
- All right.

745
00:39:05.520 --> 00:39:07.800
No, l want to be on
''The Real World''!

746
00:39:07.880 --> 00:39:11.040
You're all gonna be there.

747
00:39:11.160 --> 00:39:13.240
- Oh, shit! John!
- Derek.

748
00:39:13.360 --> 00:39:14.720
What the fuck are you
doing here, dude?

749
00:39:14.800 --> 00:39:15.840
Derek!

750
00:39:15.960 --> 00:39:17.080
Of course. l'm outta here.

751
00:39:17.200 --> 00:39:18.040
No, wait a second.

752
00:39:18.120 --> 00:39:19.400
John, get the hell out of here.
It's my night.

753
00:39:19.480 --> 00:39:21.360
Hey, l'm sorry.
l live here, too, man.

754
00:39:21.440 --> 00:39:22.840
Uh, my night.

755
00:39:22.920 --> 00:39:24.880
Girls, this is derek.
Introduce yourself.

756
00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:25.920
Hi.

757
00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:27.120
l'm Brenda.

758
00:39:27.240 --> 00:39:28.200
All of you, out!

759
00:39:28.280 --> 00:39:29.800
And he's not even
on ''The Real World.''

760
00:39:29.920 --> 00:39:32.280
What? You're an asshole!

761
00:39:32.360 --> 00:39:33.920
Ow!

762
00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:35.400
Wait. Wait.

763
00:39:35.480 --> 00:39:37.600
l had a callback. Wait, girls.

764
00:39:37.680 --> 00:39:38.840
l apologize.

765
00:39:38.920 --> 00:39:40.080
Okay, what am l doing here?

766
00:39:40.200 --> 00:39:41.240
Oh, right.

767
00:39:43.200 --> 00:39:44.600
Think fast.

768
00:39:44.680 --> 00:39:46.560
Yeah, my roommate John's
a bit of a weirdo.

769
00:39:46.640 --> 00:39:49.160
- He keeps them after he fucks.
- l get the picture.

770
00:39:49.240 --> 00:39:52.240
John, will you get
out of here, man?

771
00:39:52.360 --> 00:39:55.080
Come on. Open up, Baby Dick.

772
00:39:55.160 --> 00:39:57.960
One minute, Angel Tits!

773
00:39:58.040 --> 00:39:59.640
- Get under the bed.
- What!?

774
00:39:59.760 --> 00:40:01.160
Just trust me, okay?

775
00:40:01.280 --> 00:40:03.360
My old look was bad,
so the ka-ka came...

776
00:40:03.440 --> 00:40:06.440
but it's not raining
ka-ka anymore.

777
00:40:06.560 --> 00:40:08.000
- Okay, will you trust me?
- No.

778
00:40:08.080 --> 00:40:09.280
Just get under the bed.

779
00:40:12.720 --> 00:40:15.360
lt's raining... sperm.

780
00:40:15.440 --> 00:40:16.960
Why do l have to
get under the bed?

781
00:40:17.080 --> 00:40:18.880
l think it's raining sperm.

782
00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:21.560
Open the door immediately,
or i'll tell everyone.

783
00:40:22.920 --> 00:40:25.080
lt is raining sperm.

784
00:40:25.160 --> 00:40:29.000
Open the door.
Come on, Baby Dick.

785
00:40:29.080 --> 00:40:31.280
- Victoria.
- Hi, Baby Dick.

786
00:40:31.360 --> 00:40:32.800
l missed you.

787
00:40:35.440 --> 00:40:36.960
Put this on, now.

788
00:40:37.080 --> 00:40:38.360
Just this.

789
00:40:38.440 --> 00:40:40.960
No. l'm not gonna do it.

790
00:40:41.040 --> 00:40:43.680
l'm not gonna be your little
boy toy anymore, okay?

791
00:40:43.800 --> 00:40:45.720
l'm not gonna be your
little sex slave anymore.

792
00:40:45.840 --> 00:40:48.720
l'm sta... l'm standing up
for myself this time...

793
00:40:48.800 --> 00:40:50.200
and l'm not gonna do it.

794
00:40:50.280 --> 00:40:55.440
Oh, really? How about now?

795
00:40:55.520 --> 00:40:57.040
Never mind.

796
00:41:00.160 --> 00:41:02.320
l'm sportin' wood.

797
00:41:02.400 --> 00:41:04.560
Oh, my god! Blow my rooster!

798
00:41:04.640 --> 00:41:06.480
You're such a hot tool.

799
00:41:06.600 --> 00:41:08.840
Screw me, baby.

800
00:41:08.960 --> 00:41:11.080
Pull out your tape
MeftSU re n OW.

801
00:41:11.160 --> 00:41:12.520
Oh, yeah. Oh, my.

802
00:41:12.600 --> 00:41:14.400
Oh, yeah.

803
00:41:14.480 --> 00:41:16.800
Nail me.

804
00:41:16.920 --> 00:41:18.560
Oh, yeah. Oh, god.

805
00:41:18.680 --> 00:41:22.120
l'm gonna tile your house.

806
00:41:22.240 --> 00:41:23.560
Jackhammer.

807
00:41:23.680 --> 00:41:24.800
Rub it.

808
00:41:24.920 --> 00:41:26.200
Oh, my god.

809
00:41:26.280 --> 00:41:27.600
Feels so good.

810
00:41:27.680 --> 00:41:29.560
Take me to the
construction site!

811
00:41:36.960 --> 00:41:39.480
Nail me, baby. Nail me.

812
00:41:39.600 --> 00:41:41.200
Raise my roof, baby.

813
00:41:41.320 --> 00:41:42.280
Oh, yeah.

814
00:41:56.600 --> 00:42:01.080
Bad-ass sex every night, sweet
pledge torture every day.

815
00:42:01.160 --> 00:42:04.080
lt's so good to be me.

816
00:42:08.400 --> 00:42:12.520
Hello, Sister Victoria, Sister
Morgan, Sister Trista.

817
00:42:12.640 --> 00:42:15.280
How do the pledges greet
their Gamma sisters?

818
00:42:20.360 --> 00:42:23.080
Gamma girls are so sweet.

819
00:42:23.200 --> 00:42:26.000
May we please kiss your feet?

820
00:42:26.080 --> 00:42:27.400
Okay.

821
00:42:32.920 --> 00:42:34.760
- Ooh, l kinda like that.
- You may rise.

822
00:42:38.040 --> 00:42:40.520
So, how did your
first mission go?

823
00:42:43.600 --> 00:42:47.240
Trista, count them.

824
00:42:47.360 --> 00:42:50.360
l count six.

825
00:42:50.440 --> 00:42:52.720
Let's hope you do
better on the next one.

826
00:42:52.800 --> 00:42:54.480
We're rooting for you.

827
00:42:54.560 --> 00:42:56.440
You girls make me sick.

828
00:42:56.520 --> 00:42:58.520
Yeah, you're sick.

829
00:43:00.760 --> 00:43:02.240
Wait for me.

830
00:43:11.080 --> 00:43:12.920
Hey, boys, you
know you want it!

831
00:43:13.040 --> 00:43:15.000
l'm the horn of plenty!

832
00:43:18.920 --> 00:43:20.520
Nice legs!

833
00:43:20.640 --> 00:43:21.960
How'd you like me to
fill your diaper?

834
00:43:22.080 --> 00:43:23.280
Hey, boys.

835
00:43:23.400 --> 00:43:25.600
Mommy needs a diaper change.

836
00:43:30.440 --> 00:43:34.080
Part of becoming a gamma
is learning sophistication.

837
00:43:34.200 --> 00:43:35.960
Like mother here.

838
00:43:38.200 --> 00:43:41.560
And part of being
sophisticated is knowing...

839
00:43:41.680 --> 00:43:47.560
how to properly entertain
nice, young gentlemen.

840
00:43:47.640 --> 00:43:49.200
Oh, my God.

841
00:43:49.320 --> 00:43:50.520
Make with the rub-a-dub.

842
00:43:50.600 --> 00:43:52.880
We were promised a
sensual foot experience.

843
00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:55.160
l will burn in hell first.

844
00:43:55.240 --> 00:43:59.600
l really want to be nice, but the
smell is just... unbearable.

845
00:43:59.680 --> 00:44:01.600
You like that, baby?

846
00:44:01.720 --> 00:44:03.160
You like that?

847
00:44:03.280 --> 00:44:05.760
Mommy's gonna make you a man.

848
00:44:05.880 --> 00:44:07.600
Whoo!

849
00:44:07.680 --> 00:44:09.520
Okay.

850
00:44:09.600 --> 00:44:11.400
Who's next?

851
00:44:14.640 --> 00:44:17.960
Oh, yeah!

852
00:44:18.040 --> 00:44:21.720
lf you see, see, see, see seamen.

853
00:44:21.800 --> 00:44:23.520
Won't you free, free,
free, free them?

854
00:44:24.360 --> 00:44:26.880
l'm such a humanitarian...

855
00:44:26.960 --> 00:44:31.320
so l decided to mark her
friends up, Victoria-style.

856
00:44:31.440 --> 00:44:32.840
You don't have to do this, Max.

857
00:44:32.960 --> 00:44:34.520
l'm all right.

858
00:44:34.600 --> 00:44:36.920
Wow.

859
00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:38.840
What do we have here?

860
00:44:38.920 --> 00:44:40.000
Mother?

861
00:44:44.080 --> 00:44:46.960
These girls were
such a mess...

862
00:44:47.040 --> 00:44:50.080
it was easier to mark the
places that were okay.

863
00:44:50.160 --> 00:44:52.160
- No!
- You can do it.

864
00:44:52.240 --> 00:44:53.720
Give me that!

865
00:44:53.800 --> 00:44:55.400
Who the hell do
you think you are?

866
00:44:55.520 --> 00:44:57.800
Excuse me?

867
00:44:57.920 --> 00:45:00.400
You can't treat us like this.

868
00:45:00.480 --> 00:45:02.240
We're just trying to help you.

869
00:45:02.360 --> 00:45:03.960
lt's bullshit.

870
00:45:04.080 --> 00:45:06.200
You and your fembots just
want to make fun of us.

871
00:45:06.320 --> 00:45:08.320
Well, mission accomplished.

872
00:45:08.440 --> 00:45:09.760
You know what?

873
00:45:09.880 --> 00:45:11.720
l quit.

874
00:45:11.800 --> 00:45:17.200
Sayonara, puta.

875
00:45:17.320 --> 00:45:20.120
Three days before initiation,
and what does she do?

876
00:45:20.240 --> 00:45:22.600
Quits. Know why?

877
00:45:22.720 --> 00:45:25.000
Because she doesn't have the
dedication to be a Gamma.

878
00:45:25.120 --> 00:45:26.840
Anyone else want to drop out?

879
00:45:26.920 --> 00:45:29.080
Yes. If one goes, we all go.

880
00:45:29.160 --> 00:45:30.360
Yeah.

881
00:45:33.040 --> 00:45:34.840
They walked out on me.

882
00:45:34.920 --> 00:45:36.680
l'll get those bitches.

883
00:45:36.800 --> 00:45:38.760
Victoria... l'm still in, right?

884
00:45:38.880 --> 00:45:41.440
Kristen, you're my favorite,
and l love you, but she bailed.

885
00:45:41.560 --> 00:45:43.080
Sorry, maybe next year.

886
00:45:43.160 --> 00:45:45.400
What if l can get her back?

887
00:45:45.480 --> 00:45:48.320
lf you can get her back...

888
00:45:48.400 --> 00:45:51.120
then l'd say welcome back
to Gamma Gamma.

889
00:45:54.800 --> 00:45:56.920
Okay.

890
00:45:57.000 --> 00:45:59.080
Those nerds should have known
not to go to a real estate agent...

891
00:45:59.200 --> 00:46:00.800
that also sold churros.

892
00:46:00.880 --> 00:46:02.360
Allow me to introduce myself.

893
00:46:02.440 --> 00:46:03.560
My name is Buford Gomez.

894
00:46:03.680 --> 00:46:05.480
l'm a former border patrol agent.

895
00:46:05.600 --> 00:46:07.360
l used to put the
panic to Hispanic.

896
00:46:07.440 --> 00:46:09.080
l put the pepper spray to Jos.

897
00:46:09.200 --> 00:46:11.400
l put the baton to Juan.
That's all behind me.

898
00:46:11.480 --> 00:46:12.720
l'm helping people now.

899
00:46:12.800 --> 00:46:14.960
Look at you, look,
you soul sister.

900
00:46:15.040 --> 00:46:17.160
Them braids real? That's amazing.

901
00:46:17.240 --> 00:46:18.960
Okay, you must be
the Appalachian.

902
00:46:19.040 --> 00:46:22.920
Like a like a whack mohawk
thing going on there.

903
00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:25.680
You're like a little
redneck peacock.

904
00:46:25.800 --> 00:46:27.800
What the hell
happened there, girl?

905
00:46:27.880 --> 00:46:29.560
l don't know if
l'm comin' or goin'.

906
00:46:29.640 --> 00:46:31.240
How you doin'?

907
00:46:31.360 --> 00:46:32.520
You don't eat pork, do you?

908
00:46:32.640 --> 00:46:34.720
l'd like to pork you. Porky Pig.

909
00:46:34.800 --> 00:46:36.640
Whoa, a big girl!

910
00:46:36.720 --> 00:46:38.360
You done beat anorexia!

911
00:46:38.440 --> 00:46:41.240
l'm so glad you're a
strong, healthy girl.

912
00:46:41.320 --> 00:46:44.400
And look at... okay.
You ever been with a man?

913
00:46:44.480 --> 00:46:47.080
You ever been the man?
Never mind.

914
00:46:47.160 --> 00:46:50.560
Buford, can you show us
something we could live in?

915
00:46:50.680 --> 00:46:52.320
Okay, you need
a place to stay.

916
00:46:52.400 --> 00:46:56.280
Got it: Super Pollo Loco.

917
00:46:56.400 --> 00:46:58.880
ls it a boat? Is it a restaurant?

918
00:46:58.960 --> 00:47:00.200
Who cares!?

919
00:47:00.320 --> 00:47:05.160
lt's a hybrid with a history dating
back to pre-revolutionary Cuba.

920
00:47:05.280 --> 00:47:06.840
Smell the black
beans and rice.

921
00:47:06.920 --> 00:47:08.200
Taste the tostitos.

922
00:47:08.320 --> 00:47:09.480
Babalo, babalo, babalo.

923
00:47:09.600 --> 00:47:12.720
They don't make structures
like this anymore.

924
00:47:12.800 --> 00:47:14.880
l'm not sure they ever did.

925
00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:18.120
Two converted sleeping
bedrooms, a dining room...

926
00:47:18.200 --> 00:47:20.640
and a working deep fryer.

927
00:47:20.760 --> 00:47:21.880
Hey, great!

928
00:47:31.720 --> 00:47:33.800
l just wanted to
say that l'm sorry.

929
00:47:33.920 --> 00:47:35.360
l'm not in the mood, Kristen.

930
00:47:35.440 --> 00:47:37.600
Victoria feels really bad
about what happened.

931
00:47:37.720 --> 00:47:39.080
Please.

932
00:47:39.200 --> 00:47:41.320
She thinks you'd be a
really great Gamma.

933
00:47:41.440 --> 00:47:44.120
She told me that.

934
00:47:44.200 --> 00:47:46.240
You're the only reason...

935
00:47:46.360 --> 00:47:49.040
she let the other girls
pledge in the first place.

936
00:47:49.120 --> 00:47:50.680
lt's too late anyway.

937
00:47:54.240 --> 00:47:57.680
You could come back.

938
00:47:57.760 --> 00:47:59.760
Just think about it.

939
00:48:10.680 --> 00:48:12.040
l'm feeling this shit.

940
00:48:12.160 --> 00:48:14.120
l mean, metrosexuals
are where it's at.

941
00:48:14.240 --> 00:48:15.840
''Queer Eye'' is the shit.

942
00:48:15.960 --> 00:48:17.520
You got the queer
part down good.

943
00:48:17.600 --> 00:48:19.000
Big time.

944
00:48:21.240 --> 00:48:22.320
You know what?

945
00:48:22.400 --> 00:48:23.840
Screw you guys, okay?

946
00:48:23.960 --> 00:48:26.760
See who's laughing when l'm
getting laid in five minutes.

947
00:48:26.840 --> 00:48:28.440
By a dude.

948
00:48:28.560 --> 00:48:30.160
l think the shirt works.

949
00:48:30.280 --> 00:48:32.200
There's no way
it's gonna work.

950
00:48:32.320 --> 00:48:35.160
Excuse me, could l
get an apple martini?

951
00:48:35.280 --> 00:48:36.800
Thanks.

952
00:48:36.880 --> 00:48:38.640
l'm Jessica.

953
00:48:38.760 --> 00:48:39.800
Hey, Jessica.

954
00:48:39.880 --> 00:48:41.800
l'm Dax.

955
00:48:41.880 --> 00:48:44.440
Nice and fruity.

956
00:48:44.520 --> 00:48:46.960
So have you
got a boyfriend?

957
00:48:48.040 --> 00:48:50.080
- No! No!
- l'm sorry, l thought you--

958
00:48:50.200 --> 00:48:53.200
No, see, l'm not, um...

959
00:48:53.280 --> 00:49:00.400
Um, l mean, l'm not
speaking to him right now.

960
00:49:00.520 --> 00:49:03.160
l caught him with another guy.

961
00:49:03.280 --> 00:49:06.120
- Really?
- Yeah.

962
00:49:06.200 --> 00:49:08.720
Man, that sucks.
Guys can be such assholes.

963
00:49:08.840 --> 00:49:10.920
You're preaching
to the choir, sister.

964
00:49:11.040 --> 00:49:13.800
The gay man's choir,
which l'm a member of.

965
00:49:16.720 --> 00:49:19.120
Can l ask you a
personal question?

966
00:49:19.200 --> 00:49:22.520
Ten inches, and that's
after a cold shower.

967
00:49:22.600 --> 00:49:25.720
Have you ever been
with a woman?

968
00:49:25.840 --> 00:49:27.240
Oh, l...

969
00:49:40.240 --> 00:49:42.240
Have you ever kissed a girl?

970
00:49:42.320 --> 00:49:44.040
Here.

971
00:49:44.120 --> 00:49:46.160
l want you take this.

972
00:49:46.280 --> 00:49:48.880
lt enhances sexual experience.

973
00:49:48.960 --> 00:49:51.080
You take it orally.

974
00:49:51.200 --> 00:49:53.360
That's right. l do.

975
00:50:02.000 --> 00:50:04.280
How does that feel?

976
00:50:04.400 --> 00:50:07.800
lt's okay.

977
00:50:07.920 --> 00:50:10.640
lt doesn't feel wrong?

978
00:50:10.760 --> 00:50:15.000
Yeah, it does, but it's
the right kind of wrong.

979
00:50:22.880 --> 00:50:24.600
lt's okay.

980
00:50:31.840 --> 00:50:33.520
l'll show you what to do.

981
00:50:39.280 --> 00:50:40.640
Oh, wow.

982
00:50:40.720 --> 00:50:42.920
You're really hard.

983
00:50:43.040 --> 00:50:46.040
Oh, my God!

984
00:50:46.120 --> 00:50:49.400
l've been living a lie!

985
00:50:49.480 --> 00:50:55.240
l'm a straight man trapped in a
gay, homosexual's fabulous body!

986
00:50:55.360 --> 00:50:57.280
Set me free, child!

987
00:50:57.400 --> 00:50:58.880
Set me free!

988
00:50:59.000 --> 00:51:02.000
Hallelujah!

989
00:51:02.080 --> 00:51:03.800
Victoria's dog is missing!

990
00:51:03.920 --> 00:51:05.680
Victoria's dog is missing!

991
00:51:05.800 --> 00:51:07.240
Get the cock out of your mouth!

992
00:51:07.360 --> 00:51:08.560
Gamsie?

993
00:51:08.680 --> 00:51:09.800
Before it starts
running, right now!

994
00:51:09.880 --> 00:51:10.840
Wait a second.

995
00:51:10.960 --> 00:51:12.240
No, no. You can't go.

996
00:51:12.320 --> 00:51:13.800
You gotta help me
figure out who l am!

997
00:51:13.920 --> 00:51:15.120
l still don't know
if l'm gay or not.

998
00:51:15.240 --> 00:51:16.440
l'm sorry. Maybe another time.

999
00:51:16.520 --> 00:51:17.840
No, don't go.

1000
00:51:17.960 --> 00:51:19.240
Please, don't go!

1001
00:51:19.320 --> 00:51:21.240
Please, don't go!

1002
00:51:21.320 --> 00:51:23.320
Come back! ! !

1003
00:51:24.360 --> 00:51:26.720
l want you to take this.

1004
00:51:26.840 --> 00:51:30.920
lt enhances sexual experience.

1005
00:51:39.240 --> 00:51:41.160
Hi.

1006
00:51:41.240 --> 00:51:45.080
Your bodies are so beautiful.

1007
00:51:45.200 --> 00:51:50.120
Can l touch them?

1008
00:51:50.240 --> 00:51:54.800
Well, well, well.

1009
00:51:54.920 --> 00:52:01.400
lf it isn't Mr. Brad Pitt
ready to invade Troy.

1010
00:52:01.480 --> 00:52:05.160
And by ''Troy,''
l mean my vagina.

1011
00:52:09.880 --> 00:52:11.320
That's right, baby.

1012
00:52:11.440 --> 00:52:14.160
Mamma's got some
brand new bags.

1013
00:52:14.280 --> 00:52:17.000
Why don't you grab a handful?

1014
00:52:21.720 --> 00:52:24.520
What the fuck?

1015
00:52:24.600 --> 00:52:26.160
Morning, lover.

1016
00:52:28.600 --> 00:52:30.080
Hungry?

1017
00:52:30.200 --> 00:52:32.480
Do you want a muffin?

1018
00:52:32.560 --> 00:52:35.840
Do you want butter
or cream cheese?

1019
00:52:39.880 --> 00:52:42.320
Where are my clothes?

1020
00:52:45.840 --> 00:52:48.080
Where's my underwear?

1021
00:52:48.200 --> 00:52:50.360
l ate them.

1022
00:52:52.680 --> 00:52:55.240
No!!!

1023
00:52:57.080 --> 00:52:58.040
Call me.

1024
00:53:05.320 --> 00:53:07.200
- Hey, Gloria.
- Hey, baby.

1025
00:53:07.280 --> 00:53:08.640
Have you seen my mom?

1026
00:53:08.760 --> 00:53:11.840
l think she's back at
the chicken boat.

1027
00:53:11.960 --> 00:53:13.960
- Thanks, Gloria.
- It's all right.

1028
00:53:14.040 --> 00:53:15.480
- Hey, Gloria.
- Mm-hm?

1029
00:53:15.600 --> 00:53:16.880
What's a rim job?

1030
00:53:19.480 --> 00:53:24.360
Um, that's when you have your
tire changed in your car.

1031
00:53:24.440 --> 00:53:26.320
- Thanks, Gloria.
- It's all right.

1032
00:53:26.440 --> 00:53:28.640
- l got worried.
- Me, too.

1033
00:53:28.720 --> 00:53:31.360
- A boy in my class said it was a--
- Oh, never mind!

1034
00:53:31.480 --> 00:53:34.400
He's a bad boy,
and he's wrong.

1035
00:53:34.520 --> 00:53:37.440
Why don't you go
Iook for your mommy?

1036
00:53:37.560 --> 00:53:38.880
- Okay.
- Okay?

1037
00:53:39.000 --> 00:53:40.720
Bye.

1038
00:53:40.800 --> 00:53:42.400
Hey, there you are.

1039
00:53:42.520 --> 00:53:44.360
Been looking all over for you.

1040
00:53:44.440 --> 00:53:48.240
l'm sorry about the other night.

1041
00:53:48.360 --> 00:53:53.760
l do appreciate you
trying to help me out.

1042
00:53:53.840 --> 00:53:58.280
You have a huge
problem, derek.

1043
00:53:58.400 --> 00:54:01.160
You should seriously consider
seeing a shrink or something.

1044
00:54:01.240 --> 00:54:03.080
Do some serious couch time.

1045
00:54:03.200 --> 00:54:04.720
l did warn you.

1046
00:54:04.800 --> 00:54:07.120
True.

1047
00:54:07.200 --> 00:54:09.240
You know what?

1048
00:54:09.320 --> 00:54:10.640
lt doesn't even matter.

1049
00:54:10.720 --> 00:54:12.240
l don't care anymore.

1050
00:54:12.320 --> 00:54:14.560
Gamma Gamma can
kiss my butta butta.

1051
00:54:14.680 --> 00:54:16.240
No, no, no, no.

1052
00:54:16.320 --> 00:54:18.800
You can't quit, 'cause if you
Ieave now, then she wins.

1053
00:54:18.880 --> 00:54:20.960
Wait a minute.

1054
00:54:21.040 --> 00:54:25.040
Why are you taking our
side against her?

1055
00:54:25.160 --> 00:54:27.600
To hell with Victoria.

1056
00:54:27.720 --> 00:54:31.160
What about your addiction?

1057
00:54:31.240 --> 00:54:33.640
l'm cured.

1058
00:54:33.760 --> 00:54:38.560
l found somebody that l
care about so much more.

1059
00:54:42.200 --> 00:54:44.200
We're gonna kiss, aren't we?

1060
00:54:44.280 --> 00:54:46.000
God, l hope so.

1061
00:54:49.160 --> 00:54:51.960
- Oh, my little--
- Promise me something?

1062
00:54:52.040 --> 00:54:54.480
- Anything.
- No more pet names.

1063
00:54:54.600 --> 00:54:58.760
Think of it as step
one of your recovery.

1064
00:54:58.840 --> 00:55:02.880
#  Because it's
gonna be beautiful #

1065
00:55:02.960 --> 00:55:05.160
The Kama Sutra was originally
written in Sanskrit...

1066
00:55:05.240 --> 00:55:07.680
by an indian man
called Vatsyayana...

1067
00:55:07.760 --> 00:55:11.040
whose name literally means
''split the bamboo.''

1068
00:55:11.120 --> 00:55:13.080
lmagine, if you will...

1069
00:55:13.200 --> 00:55:15.400
a young man and a young
woman like yourself...

1070
00:55:15.520 --> 00:55:21.640
in the full thrush of a passionate
intensely sexual embrace...

1071
00:55:21.720 --> 00:55:26.960
all being watched by Garuda,
the bird of Vishnu.

1072
00:55:27.040 --> 00:55:31.360
- As those juices...
- Hey, kristen.

1073
00:55:31.440 --> 00:55:33.480
Nice legs.

1074
00:55:36.680 --> 00:55:39.200
What time do they open?

1075
00:55:39.280 --> 00:55:40.960
Disgusting.

1076
00:55:41.080 --> 00:55:44.320
Dude! Great line!

1077
00:55:44.400 --> 00:55:47.880
Que pasa, mommy?

1078
00:55:47.960 --> 00:55:53.400
Trista, Morgan is a total freak.

1079
00:55:53.480 --> 00:55:55.560
She wants to remove her rib.

1080
00:55:55.640 --> 00:55:57.520
Ow, that must really hurt.
How do you know?

1081
00:55:57.600 --> 00:55:59.240
Because l'm IM'ing her right now.

1082
00:55:59.320 --> 00:56:00.560
Wow, that's so great.

1083
00:56:00.680 --> 00:56:01.560
How do you even know that?

1084
00:56:01.680 --> 00:56:04.120
Duh. NetZero, loser.

1085
00:56:04.240 --> 00:56:07.520
Miss English, l'm sorry,
are we bothering you?

1086
00:56:07.600 --> 00:56:09.320
Oh, not at all
Professor Milch'ik.

1087
00:56:09.440 --> 00:56:11.080
Just keep it soft and quiet.

1088
00:56:11.200 --> 00:56:12.320
Thanks.

1089
00:56:12.400 --> 00:56:13.480
Where was i?

1090
00:56:13.600 --> 00:56:14.640
Yes.

1091
00:56:14.720 --> 00:56:16.200
Fruition.

1092
00:56:16.320 --> 00:56:19.200
That woman is bringing that
man to fruition through a series

1093
00:56:19.320 --> 00:56:23.000
of very mysterious and intensely
complex moves called--

1094
00:56:23.120 --> 00:56:25.000
Mysterious? Complex?

1095
00:56:25.080 --> 00:56:26.640
Men are dogs.

1096
00:56:35.240 --> 00:56:36.880
Observe.

1097
00:56:37.000 --> 00:56:38.480
Lights, please.

1098
00:56:41.840 --> 00:56:44.000
Look who's teaching now.

1099
00:56:44.080 --> 00:56:47.120
You like that, don't you?

1100
00:56:47.200 --> 00:56:49.600
Bet you wish l was yours.

1101
00:56:49.720 --> 00:56:51.800
Hot, aren't i?

1102
00:56:55.160 --> 00:56:57.440
What do we have here?

1103
00:56:57.560 --> 00:57:00.040
A little bit of this.

1104
00:57:00.120 --> 00:57:01.720
Yeah.

1105
00:57:05.760 --> 00:57:08.160
And a little bit of that.

1106
00:57:08.280 --> 00:57:10.640
l'm making you
so hot right now.

1107
00:57:10.760 --> 00:57:11.880
Yeah.

1108
00:57:14.160 --> 00:57:16.920
l bet you really wish that
l was your girlfriend.

1109
00:57:18.440 --> 00:57:20.240
Too bad.

1110
00:57:51.320 --> 00:57:53.400
Mystery solved.

1111
00:57:53.520 --> 00:57:55.640
Now let's see what you
guys have learned.

1112
00:58:00.460 --> 00:58:02.100
Okay, girls.

1113
00:58:02.220 --> 00:58:04.340
Here's to life on a
crappy-assed boat.

1114
00:58:10.780 --> 00:58:13.300
l think l'm having
the bed spins,

1115
00:58:13.380 --> 00:58:15.380
and not the good kind.

1116
00:58:15.460 --> 00:58:17.860
lt's the boat.

1117
00:58:17.980 --> 00:58:22.140
Our investment is being
tossed around like a mud hut...

1118
00:58:22.260 --> 00:58:25.780
i n m o n s o o n seas o n .

1119
00:58:25.860 --> 00:58:27.980
You'll get used to it.

1120
00:58:28.060 --> 00:58:31.860
l think l need to bow to
the porcelain goddess.

1121
00:58:31.940 --> 00:58:35.780
Sounds like she's
getting used to it.

1122
00:58:35.860 --> 00:58:38.820
She acts like she's never
been on a roller coaster...

1123
00:58:38.940 --> 00:58:40.740
with a bean burrito
in her belly.

1124
00:58:40.860 --> 00:58:41.900
Oh, crap.

1125
00:58:42.020 --> 00:58:43.420
l think l'm gonna
Iose my lunch.

1126
00:58:43.540 --> 00:58:45.140
Or taken a sip from
someone else's seven-up...

1127
00:58:45.220 --> 00:58:47.420
that they backwashed into.

1128
00:58:47.540 --> 00:58:49.020
Stop it, Gloria.

1129
00:58:49.140 --> 00:58:51.380
You're gonna make me hurl.

1130
00:58:51.460 --> 00:58:52.940
Ooh, you know what's
really gross?

1131
00:58:53.020 --> 00:58:54.500
When you take the
Iast sips of milk...

1132
00:58:54.620 --> 00:58:56.500
and then found out
there was chunks in it.

1133
00:59:10.740 --> 00:59:13.100
The FHM judges were
coming the next day...

1134
00:59:13.220 --> 00:59:14.620
and without those
geeky girls...

1135
00:59:14.740 --> 00:59:16.300
l wouldn't have my diversity.

1136
00:59:16.420 --> 00:59:17.820
l had to get them
back to Gamma.

1137
00:59:17.940 --> 00:59:19.580
So, of course, l
make Kristen do it.

1138
00:59:19.660 --> 00:59:20.660
You ready, Kristen?

1139
00:59:20.780 --> 00:59:22.940
l don't know, Victoria.

1140
00:59:23.060 --> 00:59:24.500
This is pretty fucked up.

1141
00:59:24.580 --> 00:59:26.860
l invite these girls
into my house...

1142
00:59:26.940 --> 00:59:29.620
and they have zero appreciation
for anything l've done.

1143
00:59:29.700 --> 00:59:33.740
And, Kristen,
need l remind you...

1144
00:59:33.820 --> 00:59:36.780
that this entire thing
was your idea?

1145
00:59:36.860 --> 00:59:40.660
You know, normally, l
would ask Morgan to come.

1146
00:59:40.780 --> 00:59:44.020
But there's something
special about you...

1147
00:59:44.140 --> 00:59:46.140
Kristen Haas.

1148
00:59:46.260 --> 00:59:51.780
Something special enough
to be Gamma president.

1149
00:59:51.860 --> 00:59:53.660
What?

1150
00:59:53.780 --> 00:59:55.980
l think you have
what it takes.

1151
00:59:56.060 --> 00:59:58.660
Or at least l
thought l did.

1152
00:59:58.780 --> 01:00:01.940
Now, l'm beginning to
second guess your loyalty.

1153
01:00:02.020 --> 01:00:02.980
No, no, no.

1154
01:00:03.060 --> 01:00:05.020
l'm-l'm loyal.

1155
01:00:05.140 --> 01:00:07.300
Then act like a
future Gamma pres...

1156
01:00:07.380 --> 01:00:09.980
and go and protect
your sisters.

1157
01:00:10.060 --> 01:00:11.300
Go!

1158
01:00:16.300 --> 01:00:18.020
Oh, Gamsie.

1159
01:00:18.100 --> 01:00:20.420
They'll do whatever
we tell them to.

1160
01:00:20.500 --> 01:00:23.100
Well, looks like chicken
boat's going for a swim.

1161
01:00:26.140 --> 01:00:27.020
Oh!

1162
01:00:27.100 --> 01:00:28.140
Oh, no!

1163
01:00:28.220 --> 01:00:30.620
Please don't send me
back to Gamma, Krishna.

1164
01:00:30.700 --> 01:00:32.060
Oh, no.

1165
01:00:32.180 --> 01:00:33.460
Welcome.

1166
01:00:33.540 --> 01:00:34.700
Those evil Gamma bitches
will eat me alive.

1167
01:00:34.780 --> 01:00:35.980
Oh, please no.

1168
01:00:36.060 --> 01:00:36.980
Oh!

1169
01:00:37.060 --> 01:00:38.540
lt's the evilest bitch
of all, Victoria!

1170
01:00:38.660 --> 01:00:40.300
Please, krishna, no!

1171
01:00:40.420 --> 01:00:41.580
No!

1172
01:00:50.260 --> 01:00:51.620
My physics test!

1173
01:00:51.740 --> 01:00:53.140
Motherfucker, shit!

1174
01:00:53.220 --> 01:00:54.780
Shit, motherfucker, shit!

1175
01:00:54.860 --> 01:00:55.700
Ow!

1176
01:00:55.780 --> 01:00:56.900
Fucking cock, man.

1177
01:01:00.540 --> 01:01:02.420
l lost my platapussy.

1178
01:01:05.780 --> 01:01:06.780
Somebody get me a chair.

1179
01:01:06.900 --> 01:01:08.020
l got a signal.

1180
01:01:08.140 --> 01:01:08.980
Fuck!

1181
01:01:09.100 --> 01:01:10.140
lt's gone.

1182
01:01:14.620 --> 01:01:18.220
What in god's
name is that?

1183
01:01:18.300 --> 01:01:20.740
Sure ain't no bird.

1184
01:01:25.180 --> 01:01:27.020
l think we're
being watched.

1185
01:01:27.140 --> 01:01:28.660
Who's watching?

1186
01:01:31.740 --> 01:01:32.860
Who-wee!

1187
01:01:32.980 --> 01:01:35.260
You ladies need
a tug, do ya?

1188
01:01:35.380 --> 01:01:37.460
We'll tug ya.

1189
01:01:37.540 --> 01:01:39.140
l'd love a tug.

1190
01:01:39.220 --> 01:01:40.420
Uh-huh.

1191
01:01:40.500 --> 01:01:41.460
lt's gonna cost
you though.

1192
01:01:41.540 --> 01:01:42.900
A little money up front.

1193
01:01:43.020 --> 01:01:45.380
Plus, Randy here gets to look
through all your clothes.

1194
01:01:45.460 --> 01:01:47.300
Dirty honky.

1195
01:01:47.380 --> 01:01:48.540
What did you say,
you little bitch?

1196
01:01:48.620 --> 01:01:50.300
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1197
01:01:50.380 --> 01:01:53.260
You motherfucker!

1198
01:01:53.340 --> 01:01:55.260
Oh, my god.

1199
01:01:55.340 --> 01:01:56.420
l swear to god.

1200
01:01:56.540 --> 01:01:57.780
All right, let's get
this boat roped up.

1201
01:01:57.860 --> 01:01:58.580
Come on, ladies.

1202
01:01:58.660 --> 01:01:59.620
Give me some help!

1203
01:01:59.700 --> 01:02:00.980
Let's tow this
motherfucker out of here.

1204
01:02:04.540 --> 01:02:06.260
The boat is leaking.

1205
01:02:06.380 --> 01:02:07.820
We've got nowhere to stay.

1206
01:02:07.900 --> 01:02:09.300
lt looks like we may
have to ask Victoria...

1207
01:02:09.420 --> 01:02:10.540
to take us back.

1208
01:02:10.660 --> 01:02:12.220
Oh, and you can imagine
how excited l am...

1209
01:02:12.340 --> 01:02:14.500
to have that conversation.

1210
01:02:14.580 --> 01:02:16.660
What conversation
might that be, Bitch?

1211
01:02:16.780 --> 01:02:23.420
l, um, l just wanted to
know if l can have

1212
01:02:23.500 --> 01:02:25.380
another chance to come back.

1213
01:02:25.460 --> 01:02:27.420
You think you can just
waltz back in here?

1214
01:02:27.540 --> 01:02:28.420
Yeah.

1215
01:02:28.500 --> 01:02:29.580
Can you waltz?

1216
01:02:34.020 --> 01:02:36.260
So, what do you
think, Kristen?

1217
01:02:36.380 --> 01:02:38.100
Has she learned
her lesson?

1218
01:02:38.220 --> 01:02:40.220
l think so.

1219
01:02:40.340 --> 01:02:42.460
Welcome back to Gamma.

1220
01:02:42.580 --> 01:02:44.020
Yeah!

1221
01:02:44.140 --> 01:02:45.420
Are her nipples hard?

1222
01:02:45.500 --> 01:02:46.700
Wait those are mine.

1223
01:02:57.340 --> 01:02:59.420
Gamma Gamma was selected
as a finalist in FHM's...

1224
01:02:59.500 --> 01:03:02.660
hottest sorority contest.

1225
01:03:02.780 --> 01:03:04.860
Then, guess what?

1226
01:03:04.940 --> 01:03:06.140
We won.

1227
01:03:08.860 --> 01:03:10.060
Thank you, thank you.

1228
01:03:10.140 --> 01:03:10.940
Gamma!

1229
01:03:11.060 --> 01:03:11.740
Gamma!

1230
01:03:11.860 --> 01:03:12.540
Gamma!

1231
01:03:12.660 --> 01:03:13.300
Gamma!

1232
01:03:13.420 --> 01:03:14.060
Gamma!

1233
01:03:14.180 --> 01:03:14.820
Gamma!

1234
01:03:14.900 --> 01:03:15.580
Gamma!

1235
01:03:15.700 --> 01:03:16.300
Gamma!

1236
01:03:16.420 --> 01:03:17.060
Gamma!

1237
01:03:17.140 --> 01:03:17.820
Gamma!

1238
01:03:17.940 --> 01:03:18.660
Gamma!

1239
01:03:18.740 --> 01:03:20.660
Thank you, thank you.

1240
01:03:20.780 --> 01:03:22.300
Before l was
elected president,

1241
01:03:22.380 --> 01:03:24.780
Gamma Gamma threw
average parties...

1242
01:03:24.860 --> 01:03:26.980
and made below
average impressions.

1243
01:03:27.060 --> 01:03:28.740
Not hot.

1244
01:03:28.820 --> 01:03:31.140
But since the dawn of
what i'd like to call...

1245
01:03:31.220 --> 01:03:34.580
the Victorian era, we have
achieved total hotness.

1246
01:03:37.940 --> 01:03:42.220
And we're going to be
on the cover of FHM.

1247
01:03:42.300 --> 01:03:49.500
lt's important that future
Gammas are the most poised...

1248
01:03:49.620 --> 01:03:52.620
sophisticated, and
beautiful girls on campus...

1249
01:03:52.740 --> 01:03:54.260
ftS yOU Cftn See.

1250
01:03:54.380 --> 01:03:57.700
And these are the kind of
freaks that will never get in!

1251
01:03:57.780 --> 01:03:59.860
Yeah!

1252
01:03:59.980 --> 01:04:01.220
l can't believe they
actually thought...

1253
01:04:01.300 --> 01:04:05.260
they were going to get in.

1254
01:04:05.380 --> 01:04:09.020
Let's hear it for the
Gamma girls, guys.

1255
01:04:09.140 --> 01:04:12.180
How hot is this?

1256
01:04:16.500 --> 01:04:17.940
Girls, paint them up.

1257
01:04:24.820 --> 01:04:26.460
Why won't you run?

1258
01:04:32.780 --> 01:04:33.940
This ain't right.

1259
01:04:39.700 --> 01:04:40.940
Take this!

1260
01:04:59.500 --> 01:05:01.780
l can't believe l let
her play me like that.

1261
01:05:01.900 --> 01:05:03.540
Why don't we pick
up this stuff...

1262
01:05:03.660 --> 01:05:05.100
and set the dang
house on fire?

1263
01:05:05.220 --> 01:05:07.260
And after that, we'll set
the whole campus on fire!

1264
01:05:07.380 --> 01:05:08.780
At least we'll have
somewhere to stay.

1265
01:05:08.900 --> 01:05:11.900
l hear the beds are very
comfortable in jail.

1266
01:05:11.980 --> 01:05:14.180
And we get used
to the rough sex.

1267
01:05:14.300 --> 01:05:17.020
Babs, not now.

1268
01:05:17.140 --> 01:05:19.540
Our possessions have
been strewn in the dirt...

1269
01:05:19.660 --> 01:05:21.860
like our hopes
and our dreams!

1270
01:05:21.940 --> 01:05:24.020
Oh, Krishna.

1271
01:05:24.140 --> 01:05:26.140
Why have you deserted us?

1272
01:05:26.260 --> 01:05:28.100
Why?

1273
01:05:28.180 --> 01:05:30.380
Gloria, l am so sorry.

1274
01:05:30.500 --> 01:05:31.500
Forget it, Derek.

1275
01:05:31.620 --> 01:05:32.700
l don't even
wanna hear it.

1276
01:05:32.780 --> 01:05:33.540
Well, you don't actually
think l had something...

1277
01:05:33.620 --> 01:05:34.900
to do with that, do you?

1278
01:05:35.020 --> 01:05:36.020
lt was all a big ploy...

1279
01:05:36.100 --> 01:05:37.860
to make us look like fools
in front of everyone.

1280
01:05:37.980 --> 01:05:39.780
You disgust me.

1281
01:05:39.900 --> 01:05:42.340
l swear to you l had
nothing to do with that.

1282
01:05:42.460 --> 01:05:44.820
How do l make you
understand this?

1283
01:05:44.900 --> 01:05:47.100
l have no loyalty
to her anymore.

1284
01:05:47.180 --> 01:05:48.220
Okay.

1285
01:05:48.340 --> 01:05:50.020
Prove it.

1286
01:05:50.140 --> 01:05:52.860
What's the most
important thing to her...

1287
01:05:52.980 --> 01:05:54.140
in her shallow life?

1288
01:05:54.260 --> 01:05:55.820
Besides making us
Iook like fools?

1289
01:05:55.900 --> 01:05:56.820
l don't know.

1290
01:05:56.900 --> 01:05:58.060
l really don't know.

1291
01:05:58.140 --> 01:05:59.540
FHM magazine.

1292
01:05:59.620 --> 01:06:01.140
Getting on the cover has
been an obsession of hers...

1293
01:06:01.260 --> 01:06:02.420
since i've known her.

1294
01:06:02.540 --> 01:06:03.740
For the last three years
all she wants to do..

1295
01:06:03.820 --> 01:06:05.740
is win this stupid
contest, and l know how...

1296
01:06:05.860 --> 01:06:07.740
to make that dream
turn into a nightmare.

1297
01:06:07.820 --> 01:06:09.620
This party is gonna be the
biggest night of her life.

1298
01:06:09.700 --> 01:06:11.260
You wanna get back at her?

1299
01:06:11.340 --> 01:06:14.020
The keys to Gamma Gamma.

1300
01:06:14.140 --> 01:06:18.140
Let's do it, Gloria.

1301
01:06:18.260 --> 01:06:20.300
-Give me that.
-Yes!

1302
01:06:27.500 --> 01:06:30.220
Just like everyone,
Kristen let me down.

1303
01:06:30.300 --> 01:06:32.460
But if being mean to
people turned her off...

1304
01:06:32.580 --> 01:06:35.820
then why the hell did
she become a Gamma?

1305
01:06:35.940 --> 01:06:38.740
You are not welcome
here, stabber of backs.

1306
01:06:38.860 --> 01:06:40.380
l have a good mind to
put you over my knee...

1307
01:06:40.460 --> 01:06:42.620
and give you the spanking
of your life, young lady.

1308
01:06:42.700 --> 01:06:45.140
Oh, i've been bad, too.

1309
01:06:45.220 --> 01:06:47.940
l just wanted to
say that l'm sorry.

1310
01:06:48.060 --> 01:06:49.580
l don't know what
l was thinking...

1311
01:06:49.660 --> 01:06:51.580
and l don't blame
you for hating me...

1312
01:06:51.660 --> 01:06:53.340
but l know what
l did was wrong...

1313
01:06:53.460 --> 01:06:56.340
and l want to make
it up to you.

1314
01:06:56.420 --> 01:06:58.740
Pledging a sorority isn't
worth hurting other people...

1315
01:06:58.860 --> 01:07:03.300
especially people who
used to be your friends.

1316
01:07:03.380 --> 01:07:08.260
l forgive you, my child.

1317
01:07:08.340 --> 01:07:10.780
Excuse me.

1318
01:07:15.260 --> 01:07:17.340
l know, l wouldn't
trust me either.

1319
01:07:17.420 --> 01:07:20.380
But l've changed.

1320
01:07:20.460 --> 01:07:23.620
l want to help you guys
get back at the Gammas.

1321
01:07:23.740 --> 01:07:26.260
Let's get 'em.

1322
01:07:29.780 --> 01:07:32.700
Hello, my beautiful,
beautiful bitches.

1323
01:07:32.820 --> 01:07:35.660

You are going to

1327
01:07:43.020 --> 01:07:43.900
Give me sex.

1328
01:07:43.980 --> 01:07:44.860
Give me love.

1329
01:07:44.940 --> 01:07:45.980
Give it to me.

1330
01:07:46.100 --> 01:07:47.460
This is what l want
you bitches to do.

1331
01:07:47.580 --> 01:07:49.860
Victoria, you stand
in the middle...

1332
01:07:49.940 --> 01:07:51.660
you lovely, lovely
goddess of light.

1333
01:07:51.740 --> 01:07:53.740
The rest of you bitches,
go around in a circle.

1334
01:07:53.820 --> 01:07:55.780
ln a circle!

1335
01:07:55.900 --> 01:07:56.820
Okay.

1336
01:07:56.940 --> 01:07:58.220
Yes.

1337
01:07:58.300 --> 01:07:59.860
Now, dance around
like a horse.

1338
01:07:59.940 --> 01:08:01.220
You want to be in
the picture show...

1339
01:08:01.300 --> 01:08:03.340
you have to do it like
you're on a horse.

1340
01:08:03.420 --> 01:08:06.100
All of you are creatures,
except for Victoria.

1341
01:08:06.220 --> 01:08:07.180
You stay in the middle.

1342
01:08:07.300 --> 01:08:08.300
All of you creatures.

1343
01:08:08.420 --> 01:08:10.380
Victoria, l
swear to Versace...

1344
01:08:10.500 --> 01:08:13.060
if you weren't here, l'd be
like a banana.. l'd do a split.

1345
01:08:13.140 --> 01:08:14.060
Get out of here.

1346
01:08:14.180 --> 01:08:15.060
Please, Just stay
in the middle.

1347
01:08:15.180 --> 01:08:16.260
l need to take some
pictures of you.

1348
01:08:16.380 --> 01:08:17.340
He loves me.

1349
01:08:17.460 --> 01:08:18.580
He loves me.

1350
01:08:18.660 --> 01:08:20.220
l'll make him give
me that cover.

1351
01:08:30.140 --> 01:08:32.740
Those bitches, they
snuck into Gamma

1352
01:08:32.820 --> 01:08:34.900
during our group
liposuction night.

1353
01:08:44.380 --> 01:08:47.300
These are the smallest
cameras known to man.

1354
01:08:47.380 --> 01:08:54.660
The lenses are the
size of a-of a-a pinhead.

1355
01:08:54.740 --> 01:08:58.300
Virtually undetectable.

1356
01:08:58.420 --> 01:09:03.460
You can hide these
bad boys anywhere.

1357
01:09:03.540 --> 01:09:07.340
Picture frames, sunglasses...

1358
01:09:10.620 --> 01:09:13.380
You can even hide
them in a pet's fur.

1359
01:09:26.460 --> 01:09:29.380
Hey, will you be able to
find anything on Victoria?

1360
01:09:32.300 --> 01:09:34.260
Yes.

1361
01:09:34.340 --> 01:09:36.860
You guys aren't gonna
believe what l just found.

1362
01:09:36.980 --> 01:09:38.620

1370
01:09:59.300 --> 01:10:00.820
and we can't wait to see

1371
01:10:00.900 --> 01:10:02.260

1372
01:10:02.340 --> 01:10:03.500
Tonight.

1373
01:10:11.060 --> 01:10:12.620
Come on in girls, these guys
are gonna help you on out.

1374
01:10:12.700 --> 01:10:14.140
They're my little
temp service here.

1375
01:10:14.260 --> 01:10:16.180
This is Jos, he
testified in trial...

1376
01:10:16.300 --> 01:10:18.420
for me with the border
patrol back in the day...

1377
01:10:18.540 --> 01:10:19.260
you know what l'm saying?

1378
01:10:19.340 --> 01:10:20.580
That guy with the
turban did it.

1379
01:10:20.660 --> 01:10:22.500
Now these guys wanna get
back at them Gamma bitches.

1380
01:10:22.580 --> 01:10:24.540
The Gammas turned
em on in to the INS...

1381
01:10:24.660 --> 01:10:27.500
so they wanna get
back at the girls too.

1382

Thank you.

1383
01:10:29.500 --> 01:10:32.260
Anything you need

1385
01:10:39.580 --> 01:10:40.660
No Poops.

1386
01:10:46.260 --> 01:10:47.820
Damn!

1387
01:10:47.900 --> 01:10:49.700
l mean this is
like a buffet.

1388
01:10:49.780 --> 01:10:55.340
Oh my god, that's
Carmen Electra.

1389
01:10:55.420 --> 01:10:57.060
She's my fantasy
girlfriend.

1390
01:10:57.180 --> 01:10:58.820
She's coming here.

1391
01:11:06.580 --> 01:11:08.020
Hey.

1392
01:11:08.140 --> 01:11:13.220
Um...nice legs.

Thanks.

1394
01:11:15.620 --> 01:11:20.020
What time do they open?

1395
01:11:20.140 --> 01:11:23.260
l was thinking maybe we
could go somewhere...

1396
01:11:23.340 --> 01:11:28.940
and, uh...talk.

1397
01:11:29.060 --> 01:11:30.460
Oh, Dax!

1398
01:11:30.540 --> 01:11:31.860
Oh God.

1399
01:11:31.940 --> 01:11:33.180
Hey!

1400
01:11:33.260 --> 01:11:34.780
Step away from my man!

1401
01:11:34.860 --> 01:11:36.060
l don't know her.

1402
01:11:36.140 --> 01:11:39.060
Kids this is Dax,
he's your new daddy.

1403
01:11:39.140 --> 01:11:39.700
What?

1404
01:11:39.780 --> 01:11:40.540
No, l don't have kids!

1405
01:11:40.660 --> 01:11:41.300
Pony ride!

1406
01:11:41.420 --> 01:11:42.140
No-no, don't leave!

1407
01:11:42.260 --> 01:11:43.100
Wait, Carmen!

1408
01:11:47.180 --> 01:11:48.500
By any chance
are you jewish?

1409
01:11:48.620 --> 01:11:52.380
No, l'm methodist.

1410
01:11:52.460 --> 01:11:54.980
That'll do.

1411
01:12:05.100 --> 01:12:07.460
What's up, hottie?

1412
01:12:07.580 --> 01:12:10.420
Word.

1413
01:12:10.540 --> 01:12:13.140
You ever been in the
back of a pickup truck?

1414
01:12:13.220 --> 01:12:15.620
What's a pickup truck?

1415
01:12:15.700 --> 01:12:18.500
You're about to find out.

1416
01:12:23.500 --> 01:12:25.220
You're not gonna be
needing this shit.

1417
01:12:36.580 --> 01:12:37.500

01:12:37.580 --> 01:12:39.180
Hi.

1419
01:12:39.300 --> 01:12:41.100

01:12:41.180 --> 01:12:42.700
Su-sure.

1421
01:12:42.780 --> 01:12:46.260
Champagne's really good
for the complexion.

1422
01:12:46.340 --> 01:12:49.660
Just kiss her
allready you big puss!

1423
01:12:49.740 --> 01:12:51.660
Wooo!

1424
01:12:51.780 --> 01:12:55.060
Oh, God, somebody kill me!

1425
01:12:55.180 --> 01:12:58.340

1426
01:12:58.420 --> 01:13:01.500

01:13:41.300 --> 01:13:45.020
We have searched far and

Thank you.

1439
01:14:07.780 --> 01:14:09.420
Thank you.

1440
01:14:09.540 --> 01:14:13.660
People told me, ''Victoria
no question about it...

1441
01:14:13.740 --> 01:14:15.420
''you're the hottest
sorority leader...

1442
01:14:15.500 --> 01:14:17.380
''at South Beach University.''

1443
01:14:17.500 --> 01:14:21.220
But the entire country, l
just knew l could do it.

1444
01:14:21.340 --> 01:14:28.180
And this is only the beginning
of Victoria English.

1445
01:14:28.260 --> 01:14:32.300
This is supposed to be
about Gamma, not just her.

1446
01:14:32.380 --> 01:14:34.420
Sofia, you are so hot.

1447
01:14:34.540 --> 01:14:36.780
We should totally like
do a show together.

1448
01:14:36.860 --> 01:14:38.780
Oh my god, thank
you, of course.

1449
01:14:38.860 --> 01:14:40.380
Wouldn't that

1450
01:14:40.500 --> 01:14:41.580
Do her!

1451
01:14:48.300 --> 01:14:53.980
Hi, l have a really
big favor to ask you...

1452
01:14:54.100 --> 01:14:57.900
l seem to have dropped my
earring backing over here.

1453
01:14:58.020 --> 01:15:01.380
l was wondering if you
could help me find it.

1454
01:15:01.460 --> 01:15:03.460
All right Gammas, do you
wanna see your cover?

1455
01:15:09.740 --> 01:15:11.660
We're not even on it.

1456
01:15:11.740 --> 01:15:14.420
Victoria looks

1457
01:15:17.340 --> 01:15:20.380

1458
01:15:20.500 --> 01:15:23.980
Backstabbing little bitch!

1459
01:15:24.060 --> 01:15:26.380
And now lets take a
Iook behind the scenes...

l wanna show you around.

1463
01:15:39.180 --> 01:15:41.780
This is the
master bedroom.

1464
01:15:41.900 --> 01:15:44.020
And this is Gamsie, my dog.

1465
01:15:51.260 --> 01:15:53.020
#  Twinkle-twinkle little... #

1466
01:16:00.980 --> 01:16:03.060
They showed me
on the potty.

1467
01:16:03.180 --> 01:16:05.820
What are you doing
you ugly ass?

1468
01:16:13.380 --> 01:16:16.740
You poor thing, there
you go you're better.

1469
01:16:16.860 --> 01:16:18.620
You are looking so thin.

1470
01:16:18.700 --> 01:16:19.700
Thank you.

1471
01:16:19.780 --> 01:16:21.140
Probably had
another abortion.

1472
01:16:25.540 --> 01:16:26.620
Uh-oh.

1473
01:16:36.380 --> 01:16:37.900
You fucking bitches.

1474
01:16:43.460 --> 01:16:44.300
Stop the video!

1475
01:16:44.380 --> 01:16:45.660
l did not approve of this!

1476
01:16:57.660 --> 01:16:58.580
Oh my God!

1477
01:16:58.660 --> 01:16:59.980
That's my school picture!

1478
01:17:00.060 --> 01:17:00.980
Oh, my God.

1479
01:17:01.060 --> 01:17:02.220
Where did you find that?

1480
01:17:05.020 --> 01:17:07.220
Stop the video, l did
not approve of this.

1481
01:17:10.260 --> 01:17:12.260
Very, very
interesting but...

1482
01:17:12.340 --> 01:17:14.780
This isn't the right tape.

1483
01:17:15.820 --> 01:17:18.500
l was obviously joking.

1484
01:17:18.620 --> 01:17:22.100
Everybody knows what a
great sense of humor l have.

1485
01:17:22.180 --> 01:17:23.860
You can't walk out on me!

1486
01:17:23.940 --> 01:17:25.940
Where are you all going?

1487
01:17:26.020 --> 01:17:27.260
None of this is true!

1488
01:17:27.380 --> 01:17:29.380
Don't you know who l am?

1489
01:17:29.500 --> 01:17:31.260
l'm Victoria English!

1490
01:17:31.380 --> 01:17:34.900
Those bitches just set this
up because their jealous!

1491
01:17:34.980 --> 01:17:36.700
Oh Shit.

1492
01:17:38.620 --> 01:17:40.580
Hey, any of you broads...

1493
01:17:40.660 --> 01:17:43.260

my naked body?

1494
01:17:43.380 --> 01:17:45.900
l am the one.

1495
01:17:45.980 --> 01:17:48.780
Oh, yes.

1496
01:17:48.900 --> 01:17:51.740
l am the one.

1497
01:17:55.660 --> 01:17:58.820
Aren't you one of those
Gamma Gamma girls?

1498
01:17:58.900 --> 01:18:01.860
Oh, darlin', l'm not just one
of the Gamma Gamma girls...

1499
01:18:01.980 --> 01:18:04.460
l'm victoria english.

1500
01:18:04.540 --> 01:18:07.180
Right, and l'm
Paris Hilton.

1501
01:18:13.500 --> 01:18:15.500
Where have you
been baby dick?

1502
01:18:15.620 --> 01:18:18.100
Victoria, it's all over.

1503
01:18:18.220 --> 01:18:20.060
l deserve better.

1504
01:18:20.140 --> 01:18:22.540
Better than me?

1505
01:18:22.660 --> 01:18:25.220
There's no one
better than me.

1506
01:18:25.340 --> 01:18:26.540
And there's no
way l'm gonna let...

1507
01:18:26.660 --> 01:18:28.220
some dumbass pledge
ruin my relationship...

1508
01:18:28.300 --> 01:18:30.100
with this worthless
piece of shit.

1509
01:18:30.180 --> 01:18:32.860
Victoria...

1510
01:18:32.940 --> 01:18:36.900
-Pledge this.
-Pledge this.

1511
01:18:37.020 --> 01:18:38.540
Derek disapointed me.

1512
01:18:38.620 --> 01:18:40.580
He was too clueless
to know what he had.

1513
01:18:40.660 --> 01:18:43.940
As far as l'm concerned, she
can have that tiny bastard.

1514
01:18:44.020 --> 01:18:45.940
That was great,
baby, fantastic.

1515
01:18:46.060 --> 01:18:48.660
Ari Belinsky producer
E channel Los Angeles.

1516
01:18:48.780 --> 01:18:52.100
So, where you really
an ugly kid, or what?

1517
01:18:52.180 --> 01:18:53.940
lt's all lies!

1518
01:18:54.060 --> 01:18:55.500
Oh, it's too bad.

1519
01:18:55.620 --> 01:18:57.220
l was hoping we could
do a reality show,

1520
01:18:57.300 --> 01:18:58.620
back to basic's
kind of thing...

1521
01:18:58.700 --> 01:19:01.260
but if it isn't true...

1522
01:19:01.380 --> 01:19:04.020
A show about me?

1523
01:19:04.100 --> 01:19:06.580
lt's all true!

1524
01:19:06.700 --> 01:19:08.340
lt's all true!

1525
01:19:08.460 --> 01:19:10.580
A true Gamma Gamma
never quits...

1526
01:19:10.700 --> 01:19:13.260
so l gave them the
ending they wanted.

1527
01:19:15.700 --> 01:19:19.900
Well, l guess now you
all know the real me.

1528
01:19:20.020 --> 01:19:21.620
Pretty huh?

1529
01:19:25.100 --> 01:19:27.540
Sometimes it's hard
for me to remember...

1530
01:19:27.660 --> 01:19:30.020
what it was like
all those years...

1531
01:19:30.140 --> 01:19:32.540
of being ridiculed
and laughed at.

1532
01:19:32.660 --> 01:19:34.780
l struggled to erase that
girl you saw up there...

1533
01:19:34.900 --> 01:19:38.420
and become the one that
you see down here.

1534
01:19:38.500 --> 01:19:43.620
Respected, admired, hot.

1535
01:19:43.700 --> 01:19:48.780
But l guess somewhere
along the way...

1536
01:19:48.860 --> 01:19:50.980
l became like one of those
people that caused me...

1537
01:19:51.060 --> 01:19:55.620
so much pain and that
is totally not hot.

1538
01:19:55.700 --> 01:19:58.820
lt's not about how you
Iook or building your body...

1539
01:19:58.900 --> 01:20:02.020
or straighting your nose
or getting bigger boobs.

1540
01:20:02.140 --> 01:20:06.260
lt's about your attitude
and that's what's hot...

1541
01:20:06.340 --> 01:20:08.980
and l should know
because l invented it.

1542
01:20:18.180 --> 01:20:19.940
Morgan?

1543
01:20:20.020 --> 01:20:22.020
You're a bitch!

1544
01:20:22.100 --> 01:20:26.100
You tell me now about this
hot attitude bullshit!

1545
01:20:26.220 --> 01:20:29.660
l spent my life savings
fixing my nose...

1546
01:20:29.740 --> 01:20:32.420
and my entire body
to look like you!

1547
01:20:32.540 --> 01:20:37.060
Now you tell me to
be me and not you.

1548
01:20:37.140 --> 01:20:38.700
You're a disgrace.

1549
01:20:38.820 --> 01:20:41.500
l hate you!

1550
01:20:41.620 --> 01:20:43.740
Hey, lady, get a life.

1551
01:20:48.820 --> 01:20:52.020
So, l made a nice speech
about having a good attitude...

1552
01:20:52.140 --> 01:20:53.900
and inner beauty.

1553
01:20:53.980 --> 01:20:55.500
But l can't figure out...

1554
01:20:55.620 --> 01:20:57.860
if l was mad at those girls
for showing me up...

1555
01:20:57.940 --> 01:20:59.700
or proud that they
actually managed...

1556
01:20:59.820 --> 01:21:02.060
to totally minipulate me.

1557
01:21:02.140 --> 01:21:04.060
What the heck?

1558
01:21:04.180 --> 01:21:08.420
The next year Gloria became the
president of Gamma Gamma.

1559
01:21:08.540 --> 01:21:13.220
And me, l loved
my cover so much...

1560
01:21:13.300 --> 01:21:15.620
l bought FHM magazine.
