00:00:41,508 --> 00:00:45,511
<i>I want you</i>

2
00:03:14,494 --> 00:03:17,596
Here we are,
just like I promised.

3
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:29,141
Let's do this.

4
00:03:29,143 --> 00:03:31,677
Hi.

5
00:03:31,679 --> 00:03:34,746
I'm Marsden,
we talked on the phone.

6
00:03:34,748 --> 00:03:35,814
I know who you are.

7
00:03:35,816 --> 00:03:36,848
You're late.

8
00:03:36,850 --> 00:03:39,851
Sorry, we, uh,

9
00:03:39,853 --> 00:03:43,021
we made a wrong turn
about 100 miles back.

10
00:03:43,023 --> 00:03:44,456
Tried to call you.

11
00:03:44,458 --> 00:03:46,458
There's no reception out here.

12
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:47,826
That explains it then.

13
00:03:47,828 --> 00:03:49,628
No, it doesn't.

14
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:51,597
Look...

15
00:03:53,333 --> 00:03:55,167
I don't know what to tell you.

16
00:03:55,169 --> 00:03:58,036
I have been standing
in the blazing heat

17
00:03:58,038 --> 00:03:59,504
for more than an hour,

18
00:03:59,506 --> 00:04:03,809
a minor pain
in the grand scheme of things.

19
00:04:08,982 --> 00:04:13,252
The pain of your birth
hunts you down in the end.

20
00:04:19,692 --> 00:04:21,493
Okay, maybe it's time
to unpack now.

21
00:04:21,495 --> 00:04:23,462
Yeah.
Okay.

22
00:04:23,464 --> 00:04:24,863
The rules are simple.

23
00:04:24,865 --> 00:04:26,632
No smoking on the premises,

24
00:04:26,634 --> 00:04:28,100
no pets,

25
00:04:28,102 --> 00:04:30,969
and no moving of any furniture.

26
00:04:32,538 --> 00:04:34,373
See you later.

27
00:04:41,547 --> 00:04:42,614
Oh, no, baby, I got it.

28
00:04:42,616 --> 00:04:43,882
It's good.

29
00:04:43,884 --> 00:04:44,883
Are you sure?

30
00:04:44,885 --> 00:04:45,884
Yeah.

31
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:57,129
I'll be in there.

32
00:05:11,678 --> 00:05:13,412
Excuse me, excuse me.

33
00:05:14,514 --> 00:05:16,014
You know how you said

34
00:05:16,016 --> 00:05:17,683
you were waiting out
in the hot sun all day?

35
00:05:17,685 --> 00:05:19,051
Yes.

36
00:05:20,887 --> 00:05:22,754
Why didn't you go
inside the house?

37
00:05:22,756 --> 00:05:25,324
I don't go in there.

38
00:05:32,198 --> 00:05:34,533
Crazy, crazy bitch.

39
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:15,507
Oh, man.

40
00:06:20,947 --> 00:06:23,081
Pirino, seriously?

41
00:06:23,083 --> 00:06:24,449
I warned you.

42
00:06:24,451 --> 00:06:26,118
You know
this place is a disaster.

43
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:27,919
Look, me and Colline,

44
00:06:27,921 --> 00:06:29,721
we're gonna take
the master bedroom, all right?

45
00:06:29,723 --> 00:06:31,223
And why is that?

46
00:06:31,225 --> 00:06:32,457
Because I'm me.

47
00:06:32,459 --> 00:06:33,692
Ha-ha-ha-ha.

48
00:06:33,694 --> 00:06:35,460
Ha-ha-ha-ha.

49
00:06:35,462 --> 00:06:36,461
Dick.

50
00:06:46,939 --> 00:06:48,940
How?

51
00:06:48,942 --> 00:06:51,109
How did we let Pirino
get us into this mess?

52
00:06:51,111 --> 00:06:52,744
He means well.

53
00:06:54,881 --> 00:06:56,248
I guess.

54
00:06:59,752 --> 00:07:01,887
Are you okay?

55
00:07:01,889 --> 00:07:03,321
Yeah. I'm fine.

56
00:07:06,392 --> 00:07:07,592
You got this on your own?

57
00:07:07,594 --> 00:07:08,994
Yeah.

58
00:07:08,996 --> 00:07:10,095
Okay. I'll see you
out there, okay?

59
00:07:10,097 --> 00:07:11,096
Okay.

60
00:07:20,573 --> 00:07:22,808
When Pirino said we were
roughing it, he was
not joking, was he?

61
00:07:22,810 --> 00:07:24,643
Yeah.

62
00:07:24,645 --> 00:07:27,813
It's okay though,
Maybe it'll help
with the ritual.

63
00:07:27,815 --> 00:07:29,981
Listen to you, man.

64
00:07:32,885 --> 00:07:34,753
I made some changes, you know.

65
00:07:34,755 --> 00:07:36,321
Besides, we're camping, right?

66
00:07:36,323 --> 00:07:38,457
This is like the Taj Mahal
of camping tents.

67
00:07:38,459 --> 00:07:40,425
Yeah, right.

68
00:07:48,267 --> 00:07:51,636
This old lady's
got some strange taste.

69
00:07:52,839 --> 00:07:54,473
Yeah, seriously.

70
00:07:55,641 --> 00:07:57,776
It's kind of weird though,

71
00:07:57,778 --> 00:08:00,345
I feel like, I don't know,

72
00:08:00,347 --> 00:08:02,614
like I've seen this shit
somewhere before.

73
00:08:04,417 --> 00:08:06,284
Yeah.
You know what I mean?

74
00:08:06,286 --> 00:08:08,787
Yeah, yeah, remember
when we first came to L.A.,

75
00:08:08,789 --> 00:08:12,157
we stopped at that
bed and breakfast?

76
00:08:12,159 --> 00:08:15,293
Yeah, Joshua Tree.
Remember?

77
00:08:16,429 --> 00:08:17,529
Oh, yeah.

78
00:08:19,031 --> 00:08:20,866
Hey, look, it's an antique.

79
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:35,680
Oh, God.

80
00:08:35,682 --> 00:08:37,182
Oh, do you remember

81
00:08:37,184 --> 00:08:38,783
when your dad
taught us the waltz?

82
00:08:41,521 --> 00:08:42,821
There you go.

83
00:08:42,823 --> 00:08:44,189
Why do you want to waltz?
You know.

84
00:08:44,191 --> 00:08:45,657
I know, we hated it, huh?

85
00:08:45,659 --> 00:08:49,027
One, two, three.

86
00:08:51,631 --> 00:08:54,533
One, two...

87
00:08:56,269 --> 00:08:59,170
You still suck.
I'm a better waltzer than you.

88
00:08:59,172 --> 00:09:00,372
Yeah, well...

89
00:09:00,374 --> 00:09:02,774
I make up for it in style.

90
00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:13,952
You're not gonna leave me?

91
00:09:13,954 --> 00:09:15,687
I'm not making
that mistake again.

92
00:09:17,056 --> 00:09:18,390
I promise.

93
00:09:20,893 --> 00:09:22,193
I'm here for you.

94
00:09:24,063 --> 00:09:25,564
For me?

95
00:09:27,166 --> 00:09:29,801
You know, Lilly was a part
of both of us.

96
00:09:29,803 --> 00:09:31,970
You really got to be there
for her, too.

97
00:09:33,973 --> 00:09:35,473
Of course.

98
00:09:40,813 --> 00:09:43,682
Of course.

99
00:09:43,684 --> 00:09:47,052
And your son.
Maybe this isn't
just my deal.

100
00:09:47,054 --> 00:09:49,354
We have to do this together.

101
00:09:49,356 --> 00:09:52,991
100%, I promise.

102
00:09:52,993 --> 00:09:55,760
100%.

103
00:09:55,762 --> 00:10:00,498
Hey, I'm putting
my faith in Pirino.

104
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:03,702
Pirino of all people, come on.

105
00:10:03,704 --> 00:10:04,703
I trust Pirino.

106
00:10:04,705 --> 00:10:06,371
Well, you're crazy.

107
00:10:06,373 --> 00:10:07,505
Shut up.

108
00:10:08,874 --> 00:10:10,375
I trust you too.

109
00:10:10,377 --> 00:10:11,509
You do?

110
00:10:16,382 --> 00:10:17,349
Yeah.

111
00:10:17,351 --> 00:10:19,985
I'm gonna go unpack.

112
00:10:19,987 --> 00:10:20,986
Okay.

113
00:10:27,326 --> 00:10:29,995
Don't lose yourself in here
and keep me lonely.

114
00:10:36,869 --> 00:10:38,103
Fuck.

115
00:11:30,756 --> 00:11:32,824
Someone down there?

116
00:11:45,805 --> 00:11:47,672
Okay.

117
00:11:47,674 --> 00:11:49,641
Oh, shit.

118
00:12:19,939 --> 00:12:21,339
Is anyone in there?

119
00:13:47,459 --> 00:13:50,495
Hey, thinking about her, huh?

120
00:13:52,832 --> 00:13:53,865
Yeah.

121
00:13:53,867 --> 00:13:56,134
Come on.

122
00:13:56,136 --> 00:13:58,636
It's time for a huggy-hug.

123
00:13:58,638 --> 00:14:00,972
Huggy-hug. Jesus.

124
00:14:05,511 --> 00:14:07,378
I was a good mom, you know?

125
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:10,381
Yeah. You are.

126
00:14:12,017 --> 00:14:13,718
Hey, forget about that.

127
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:15,753
Come help me with this stuff,

128
00:14:15,755 --> 00:14:17,722
I can't do this
in my condition.

129
00:14:18,891 --> 00:14:21,259
Your condition?
Jesus.

130
00:14:21,261 --> 00:14:22,393
It's not even
pea-sized yet.

131
00:14:22,395 --> 00:14:24,596
Yeah.
Best to be cautious.

132
00:14:31,203 --> 00:14:33,171
Remember when we were younger,

133
00:14:33,173 --> 00:14:34,405
we talked about having our kids

134
00:14:34,407 --> 00:14:35,940
and watching them
grow up together?

135
00:14:38,544 --> 00:14:40,411
Yeah.

136
00:14:40,413 --> 00:14:41,779
We can still do it.

137
00:14:41,781 --> 00:14:43,681
Yeah.

138
00:14:53,659 --> 00:14:54,726
Hey, Colline.

139
00:14:54,728 --> 00:14:56,527
Yeah.

140
00:14:56,529 --> 00:14:58,763
When Marsden
stayed with you guys...

141
00:15:02,902 --> 00:15:05,103
did he ever
talk about me or Lilly?

142
00:15:09,241 --> 00:15:11,409
I'm sure he was thinking
about you, Sera.

143
00:16:00,292 --> 00:16:01,559
Wow.

144
00:16:03,095 --> 00:16:04,963
Mars,

145
00:16:04,965 --> 00:16:06,331
you did good, man.

146
00:16:06,333 --> 00:16:08,232
This is perfect.

147
00:16:08,234 --> 00:16:09,834
You said you wanted
death effigy, right?

148
00:16:09,836 --> 00:16:12,136
It's beautiful.

149
00:16:15,674 --> 00:16:17,608
Hey, you know,

150
00:16:17,610 --> 00:16:20,078
I've been meaning
to give this to you.

151
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:21,746
What's this?

152
00:16:23,983 --> 00:16:28,319
Remember that week you
and Serafina went to Paris,

153
00:16:28,321 --> 00:16:30,421
Lilly stayed with us?

154
00:16:30,423 --> 00:16:32,256
Yeah.

155
00:16:32,258 --> 00:16:34,325
Why didn't you
tell me about this?

156
00:16:34,327 --> 00:16:35,960
I just found it recently,

157
00:16:35,962 --> 00:16:38,329
it was under the rug
in the guest room.

158
00:16:43,469 --> 00:16:45,937
I miss her, man.

159
00:16:45,939 --> 00:16:48,573
You know, when she passed,

160
00:16:48,575 --> 00:16:49,774
it broke us all up.

161
00:16:49,776 --> 00:16:50,975
You know that, right?

162
00:16:50,977 --> 00:16:52,343
Yeah.

163
00:16:54,813 --> 00:16:57,248
She's gonna take time, right?

164
00:16:58,951 --> 00:17:00,618
Time is now, man.

165
00:17:01,754 --> 00:17:03,254
It's tonight.

166
00:17:03,256 --> 00:17:04,822
Huh?

167
00:17:04,824 --> 00:17:06,691
Throw that energy around.

168
00:17:06,693 --> 00:17:09,627
You wanna put this up?
Let's raise it.

169
00:17:11,597 --> 00:17:12,997
Yeah, let's see
what happens to it.

170
00:17:16,368 --> 00:17:17,368
Yeah, I got it.

171
00:17:17,370 --> 00:17:19,504
One, two, three.

172
00:17:28,147 --> 00:17:32,116
Breathe in and out,
deeply from the abdomen.

173
00:17:32,118 --> 00:17:34,285
You can do this,

174
00:17:34,287 --> 00:17:36,654
you can do this.

175
00:18:03,282 --> 00:18:06,684
We each brought an object
that holds Lilly's energy.

176
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:10,988
These are attachments
to a life that is no more.

177
00:18:13,225 --> 00:18:14,992
We have to die
to these attachments

178
00:18:14,994 --> 00:18:16,794
in order to set ourselves free.

179
00:19:04,710 --> 00:19:07,445
I can't do this.
You can do it.

180
00:19:07,447 --> 00:19:09,447
You have more toys at home,

181
00:19:09,449 --> 00:19:11,582
you have more pictures at home,

182
00:19:11,584 --> 00:19:12,583
you can do this.

183
00:19:26,765 --> 00:19:29,567
That's good.
That's good.

184
00:19:43,115 --> 00:19:45,716
I want you guys
to start breathing.

185
00:19:47,854 --> 00:19:49,053
Rapidly.

186
00:19:49,055 --> 00:19:50,288
Fast, tight breathing.

187
00:19:51,857 --> 00:19:54,358
Equal amounts of air

188
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:56,360
in and out
through your nostrils.

189
00:19:56,362 --> 00:19:59,564
Elevating your consciousness
out of your bodies.

190
00:20:02,467 --> 00:20:06,604
I want you to face death,
enter death,

191
00:20:06,606 --> 00:20:08,873
don't be afraid of death.

192
00:20:08,875 --> 00:20:10,608
Without the awareness of death,

193
00:20:10,610 --> 00:20:13,744
life is ordinary and trivial.

194
00:20:13,746 --> 00:20:17,248
It's only because
death stalks us

195
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:19,450
that life comes alive.

196
00:20:19,452 --> 00:20:22,253
I want you to face
the mysteries of death,

197
00:20:22,255 --> 00:20:25,122
face it in a way others
dare not tread.

198
00:20:25,124 --> 00:20:28,125
I want you to
forget your religion.

199
00:20:28,127 --> 00:20:32,230
I want you to leave behind
your spiritual beliefs.

200
00:20:32,232 --> 00:20:36,000
Any preconception you have
of what death is.

201
00:20:36,002 --> 00:20:38,402
There is no heaven,
there is no hell,

202
00:20:38,404 --> 00:20:42,506
there is no afterlife,
there is no reincarnation!

203
00:20:42,508 --> 00:20:46,911
Death is the infinite abyss
of pure nonexistence.

204
00:20:46,913 --> 00:20:48,279
Enter it and be done.

205
00:20:54,186 --> 00:20:58,155
I want you to call death
with me, call death.

206
00:20:58,157 --> 00:20:59,423
I call death.

207
00:20:59,425 --> 00:21:05,096
I call death.
I call death.

208
00:21:05,098 --> 00:21:06,998
I call death.

209
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,499
I can't say that.

210
00:21:08,501 --> 00:21:12,770
You can say it,
"I call death."

211
00:21:12,772 --> 00:21:15,973
I call death.

212
00:21:15,975 --> 00:21:17,475
Say it!

213
00:21:17,477 --> 00:21:19,510
Say it.

214
00:21:19,512 --> 00:21:21,412
I call death.

215
00:21:23,015 --> 00:21:25,116
I call death!

216
00:21:25,118 --> 00:21:29,287
I call death! I call death!

217
00:21:29,289 --> 00:21:30,421
I call death.

218
00:21:31,657 --> 00:21:33,157
I call death!

219
00:21:33,159 --> 00:21:35,259
I call death.

220
00:21:35,261 --> 00:21:38,029
I call death!

221
00:21:38,031 --> 00:21:42,266
I call death!
I call death!

222
00:21:42,268 --> 00:21:47,271
I call death! I call death!

223
00:21:47,273 --> 00:21:52,443
I call death!
I call death!

224
00:21:52,445 --> 00:21:57,782
I call death! I call death!

225
00:21:57,784 --> 00:22:03,187
I call death!
I call death!

226
00:22:03,189 --> 00:22:05,456
I call death!

227
00:22:05,458 --> 00:22:10,194
I call death! I call death!

228
00:22:11,196 --> 00:22:13,331
<i>You call death!</i>

229
00:22:20,539 --> 00:22:23,307
Okay, guys,
let's just breathe.

230
00:22:24,576 --> 00:22:28,546
Deep breaths from the abdomen.

231
00:22:44,830 --> 00:22:46,664
Wait a minute.

232
00:22:53,071 --> 00:22:55,906
What's wrong?

233
00:22:55,908 --> 00:22:58,042
Are you okay?

234
00:22:58,044 --> 00:22:59,577
I can't remember anything.

235
00:23:02,314 --> 00:23:05,216
Does anybody remember
planning this trip?

236
00:23:07,252 --> 00:23:08,552
Sure. We, uh...

237
00:23:09,755 --> 00:23:11,655
Honey.

238
00:23:19,431 --> 00:23:20,598
I don't remember either.

239
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:23,167
Huh.

240
00:23:29,007 --> 00:23:31,742
I can't remember a thing.

241
00:23:38,683 --> 00:23:40,551
What?
What?

242
00:23:40,553 --> 00:23:41,852
Oh, my God.

243
00:23:44,890 --> 00:23:47,124
What?
I just saw something
in the house.

244
00:23:47,126 --> 00:23:49,093
I just saw something
in the house.

245
00:23:49,095 --> 00:23:50,895
Something in the house,
we're all outside.

246
00:23:53,465 --> 00:23:54,965
Mars, babe.

247
00:24:14,719 --> 00:24:16,220
You really scared the crap
out of me.

248
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:24,094
Yeah,

249
00:24:24,096 --> 00:24:28,732
that was spiritual,
heavy breathing nonsense.

250
00:24:29,734 --> 00:24:31,469
It's pointless.

251
00:24:34,773 --> 00:24:38,642
Have you ever hallucinated
like that before?

252
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:43,914
No.

253
00:24:50,755 --> 00:24:52,156
You okay, sweetheart?

254
00:24:56,928 --> 00:24:58,662
It's not just your memory.

255
00:24:58,664 --> 00:25:03,000
I can't remember how
and why we came out here.

256
00:25:13,912 --> 00:25:16,914
How did our life
get to be such a nightmare?

257
00:25:25,323 --> 00:25:28,659
Baby, is everything okay
in there?

258
00:25:28,661 --> 00:25:29,693
Yeah.

259
00:25:32,831 --> 00:25:34,932
Come back to bed.

260
00:25:34,934 --> 00:25:36,934
Yeah, in a minute.

261
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:57,187
<i>Wake up.</i>

262
00:26:05,830 --> 00:26:07,331
Mars.

263
00:26:08,967 --> 00:26:10,434
Marsden.

264
00:26:11,970 --> 00:26:13,337
Mars.

265
00:26:15,707 --> 00:26:17,341
Mars.

266
00:28:46,057 --> 00:28:47,458
I want to know who did this.

267
00:28:50,261 --> 00:28:52,296
Somebody speak!

268
00:28:55,633 --> 00:28:57,568
I saw that burn in the fire.

269
00:28:57,570 --> 00:28:59,069
Yeah.

270
00:28:59,071 --> 00:29:01,138
Do you think this is funny?

271
00:29:01,140 --> 00:29:03,941
No, not at all.

272
00:29:03,943 --> 00:29:05,275
If this is your idea
of helping people,

273
00:29:05,277 --> 00:29:07,778
it's sick, it's fucking stupid.

274
00:29:07,780 --> 00:29:09,580
Look, Sera, I don't know
what's going on

275
00:29:09,582 --> 00:29:12,116
but there's no one here
who'd do this.

276
00:29:12,118 --> 00:29:14,384
Okay?

277
00:29:14,386 --> 00:29:16,086
This is my daughter's doll.

278
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:21,158
I can still
smell her scent in it,

279
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:23,594
I can smell her,
I can feel her.

280
00:29:23,596 --> 00:29:25,729
How dare you!

281
00:29:25,731 --> 00:29:27,931
No, why don't you
stand up for her?

282
00:29:27,933 --> 00:29:32,469
Look, guys, there's got to be
a rational explanation, okay?

283
00:29:33,938 --> 00:29:35,105
Did you do this, man?

284
00:29:37,976 --> 00:29:42,980
Where's the needle
and the thread?
Maybe you did it.

285
00:29:42,982 --> 00:29:45,082
I'll find out.

286
00:29:45,084 --> 00:29:46,617
Show you who your friends
really are.

287
00:29:46,619 --> 00:29:48,152
Sera.

288
00:29:48,154 --> 00:29:49,453
Oh, my God.

289
00:30:07,605 --> 00:30:10,641
That trick was revolting.

290
00:30:10,643 --> 00:30:12,976
I get it, shock therapy.

291
00:30:14,746 --> 00:30:15,946
Why didn't you just tell me?

292
00:30:15,948 --> 00:30:17,314
Did you think
I was gonna stop you?

293
00:30:17,316 --> 00:30:18,949
I probably would have.

294
00:30:18,951 --> 00:30:20,384
Look, if you want me to be

295
00:30:20,386 --> 00:30:21,785
part of this whole
spiritual guru thing,

296
00:30:21,787 --> 00:30:23,420
we got to start
trusting each other.

297
00:30:23,422 --> 00:30:26,790
Why do you think
I would do that?
I didn't do that.

298
00:30:26,792 --> 00:30:29,326
The whole point was
to release the inner demons,

299
00:30:29,328 --> 00:30:30,561
so why would I recycle them?

300
00:30:30,563 --> 00:30:31,762
It doesn't make any sense.

301
00:30:31,764 --> 00:30:33,330
Look, if this is gonna work,

302
00:30:33,332 --> 00:30:35,065
we have to be a unified front.

303
00:30:37,837 --> 00:30:40,003
Great. She's tearing
our room apart.

304
00:30:41,239 --> 00:30:42,472
Damn it.

305
00:30:43,975 --> 00:30:44,975
Fuck.

306
00:31:37,028 --> 00:31:38,662
Colline?

307
00:31:38,664 --> 00:31:40,230
Colline!

308
00:31:43,968 --> 00:31:45,636
She okay?

309
00:31:49,607 --> 00:31:50,974
Oh, my God.

310
00:31:53,645 --> 00:31:56,313
What?
Who cut you?

311
00:31:56,315 --> 00:31:59,149
No, no, no, no,
it's just stitched up.

312
00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:03,620
What happened to you?

313
00:32:03,622 --> 00:32:05,155
Listen, you guys stay right
here, I'll be right back.

314
00:32:06,658 --> 00:32:07,691
Something hit me.

315
00:32:10,295 --> 00:32:11,361
It burns!

316
00:32:11,363 --> 00:32:12,396
Baby, it hurts.

317
00:32:14,299 --> 00:32:16,533
Here, all together.
It's okay, just relax.

318
00:32:20,171 --> 00:32:21,972
All right.
Guys, get upstairs.

319
00:32:21,974 --> 00:32:24,741
Get in a room, lock the door
and call the police, okay?

320
00:32:24,743 --> 00:32:25,809
Let's take her outside.

321
00:32:25,811 --> 00:32:27,711
Fuck it.
Just go upstairs.

322
00:32:27,713 --> 00:32:28,912
Hurry up.

323
00:32:28,914 --> 00:32:30,580
Go with her, go with her.

324
00:32:30,582 --> 00:32:32,382
I'm right behind you.
I'm right behind you.

325
00:32:32,384 --> 00:32:33,917
We got to find him!
Just go upstairs!

326
00:32:33,919 --> 00:32:35,018
Get him!
Get him!

327
00:32:35,020 --> 00:32:36,653
Go upstairs!
Lock the door!

328
00:32:36,655 --> 00:32:37,988
We're gonna get him, all right?

329
00:32:37,990 --> 00:32:39,423
We're gonna get him.
Lock the door!

330
00:32:39,425 --> 00:32:42,225
Hey, come on!
Snap out of it, man.

331
00:32:42,227 --> 00:32:43,527
Go check
the front of the house,

332
00:32:43,529 --> 00:32:44,561
I'll check
the back of the house.

333
00:32:44,563 --> 00:32:45,562
Okay.

334
00:32:45,564 --> 00:32:46,663
All right?
Okay.

335
00:32:46,665 --> 00:32:49,866
Hurry up, come on.
Let's go.

336
00:34:29,267 --> 00:34:30,734
Marsden, get down here!

337
00:34:33,271 --> 00:34:34,271
Shit.

338
00:34:38,409 --> 00:34:39,609
Marsden, get out here!

339
00:34:42,146 --> 00:34:43,280
Pirino!

340
00:34:52,290 --> 00:34:53,523
Pirino?

341
00:34:57,495 --> 00:34:58,895
Pirino?

342
00:35:16,747 --> 00:35:18,648
Jeez.

343
00:35:18,650 --> 00:35:20,183
Oh, my God.

344
00:35:22,153 --> 00:35:23,520
There's nobody out there.

345
00:35:23,522 --> 00:35:24,821
What do you mean?

346
00:35:24,823 --> 00:35:27,357
He's gone.
He's completely gone.

347
00:35:27,359 --> 00:35:28,592
How can that be?

348
00:35:28,594 --> 00:35:30,794
He took the car.

349
00:35:30,796 --> 00:35:32,262
Come on.

350
00:35:32,264 --> 00:35:33,263
What?

351
00:35:42,540 --> 00:35:43,540
Why?

352
00:35:47,945 --> 00:35:49,679
I just don't get it.

353
00:35:49,681 --> 00:35:52,682
I mean, how the hell
can someone stitch you up

354
00:35:52,684 --> 00:35:53,950
that quickly?

355
00:35:56,554 --> 00:35:57,787
I just don't get it.

356
00:35:57,789 --> 00:35:59,656
Doesn't make any sense.

357
00:35:59,658 --> 00:36:01,324
You were only alone
for a couple of minutes.

358
00:36:01,326 --> 00:36:03,660
At least we know you weren't
hallucinating earlier on.

359
00:36:03,662 --> 00:36:05,061
Yeah.

360
00:36:06,464 --> 00:36:08,732
I still can't
remember anything.

361
00:36:10,334 --> 00:36:12,302
Look, let's just
get out of here.

362
00:36:12,304 --> 00:36:14,704
He took the car.

363
00:36:14,706 --> 00:36:16,306
Well, this is
just fucking great.

364
00:36:16,308 --> 00:36:17,674
We have no car...

365
00:36:18,676 --> 00:36:19,843
no food.

366
00:36:21,345 --> 00:36:23,313
And somehow
we got to get to a hospital.

367
00:36:23,315 --> 00:36:25,215
And how do you
propose we do that?

368
00:36:25,217 --> 00:36:26,850
Fuck.

369
00:36:27,985 --> 00:36:29,319
We're gonna have to walk.

370
00:36:32,523 --> 00:36:33,523
He's right.

371
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:36,993
There's no other way.

372
00:36:36,995 --> 00:36:39,296
That's 50 miles.

373
00:36:41,332 --> 00:36:43,200
50 miles to the nearest town.

374
00:36:43,202 --> 00:36:45,068
Look, we're gonna have
to figure out some protection.

375
00:36:48,673 --> 00:36:51,474
You don't plan this right,
we could die out there.

376
00:36:53,477 --> 00:36:54,644
What if he comes back?

377
00:36:54,646 --> 00:36:56,980
Fuck him, I hope he comes back.

378
00:38:01,445 --> 00:38:03,947
Oh, screw it, screw it.

379
00:38:03,949 --> 00:38:05,582
I'm taking a break.

380
00:38:22,433 --> 00:38:23,867
Oh, God.

381
00:38:23,869 --> 00:38:25,702
If we can't walk
a quarter of a mile

382
00:38:25,704 --> 00:38:27,404
I don't think we can make 50.

383
00:38:30,374 --> 00:38:32,609
I mean, there's
bound to be some cars

384
00:38:32,611 --> 00:38:34,244
once we hit the highway.

385
00:38:34,246 --> 00:38:37,781
We didn't see any
driving up past Barstow.

386
00:38:39,483 --> 00:38:41,418
Guys, we got to stay
positive, all right?

387
00:38:47,625 --> 00:38:49,159
I don't know.

388
00:38:49,161 --> 00:38:51,227
Maybe if we
get into that valley,

389
00:38:51,229 --> 00:38:53,129
we might be
able to pick up a signal.

390
00:38:53,131 --> 00:38:54,764
What do you think?

391
00:38:54,766 --> 00:38:56,166
Looks like about 20 miles.

392
00:38:56,168 --> 00:38:58,168
That's less than 50.

393
00:39:01,907 --> 00:39:03,306
Oh, God.
We're gonna die.

394
00:39:06,510 --> 00:39:07,577
Yeah.

395
00:39:35,072 --> 00:39:37,173
This ain't right.

396
00:39:39,276 --> 00:39:40,777
How can this be possible?

397
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:43,680
I don't know.

398
00:39:48,919 --> 00:39:51,187
There's not supposed to be
an eclipse right now, is there?

399
00:39:51,189 --> 00:39:54,591
The moon is working
on its own almanac.

400
00:39:57,194 --> 00:39:58,461
What does this mean?

401
00:40:06,270 --> 00:40:09,806
Guys, we should go back.

402
00:40:11,475 --> 00:40:13,476
No, dude, we should
just keep going.

403
00:40:13,478 --> 00:40:14,711
I don't want to go back
to that house.

404
00:40:33,063 --> 00:40:34,864
What do you think now?
Maybe we should go?

405
00:40:38,502 --> 00:40:39,636
Oh, shit!

406
00:41:19,643 --> 00:41:20,710
Go, go!

407
00:41:43,667 --> 00:41:45,368
Oh, my God.

408
00:41:46,604 --> 00:41:47,237
Yeah.

409
00:41:50,774 --> 00:41:52,742
It's the end of the world.

410
00:42:31,382 --> 00:42:32,382
Hey!

411
00:42:37,922 --> 00:42:39,622
Maybe it was just the wind.

412
00:42:39,624 --> 00:42:41,891
Maybe there's a window open
on the other side.

413
00:42:41,893 --> 00:42:43,893
No, no.

414
00:42:43,895 --> 00:42:47,931
Pirino, it's just a wall
on that side, man.

415
00:42:47,933 --> 00:42:49,399
Go and check it out.

416
00:42:49,401 --> 00:42:51,067
Are you fucking kidding me?

417
00:43:03,314 --> 00:43:04,314
Oh, God.

418
00:43:10,487 --> 00:43:11,821
Get out of there!

419
00:43:14,726 --> 00:43:15,725
Shit.

420
00:43:18,429 --> 00:43:20,597
Look, man, you come out
or we're coming in!

421
00:43:27,938 --> 00:43:29,105
Marsden.

422
00:43:32,676 --> 00:43:37,413
Dude you just signed your
own fucking death warrant!

423
00:43:42,653 --> 00:43:43,853
Go!

424
00:43:45,356 --> 00:43:48,257
Remember, there's, like,
an axe or a crowbar.

425
00:43:48,259 --> 00:43:49,292
Yeah, I saw that.

426
00:43:49,294 --> 00:43:50,326
Go get it, Pirino, go!

427
00:43:54,765 --> 00:43:57,367
Okay, listen, take care.

428
00:43:57,369 --> 00:43:59,502
Hey, take this, okay?

429
00:44:11,682 --> 00:44:13,082
Come on, man!
Come on!

430
00:44:45,115 --> 00:44:46,115
I'll try.

431
00:45:00,798 --> 00:45:01,964
Ah!

432
00:45:01,966 --> 00:45:02,965
God.

433
00:45:04,034 --> 00:45:05,334
That armor's thick.

434
00:45:08,172 --> 00:45:10,106
So's the wall, man.

435
00:45:10,108 --> 00:45:11,741
What the hell is this thing
doing down here?

436
00:45:40,671 --> 00:45:42,138
Don't let it psych you out.

437
00:45:42,140 --> 00:45:46,075
Any two-bit magician
can do that!

438
00:45:46,077 --> 00:45:48,377
Look, motherfucker,
I ain't scared, man!

439
00:45:48,379 --> 00:45:49,912
You ain't scaring nobody!

440
00:45:49,914 --> 00:45:52,014
I got a big axe out here!

441
00:45:52,016 --> 00:45:53,816
It's going to up your ass,
through your mouth,

442
00:45:53,818 --> 00:45:56,052
smashing your teeth out,
you motherfucker!

443
00:45:56,054 --> 00:46:00,389
You dirty motherfucker!
You dirty motherfucker!

444
00:46:00,391 --> 00:46:03,893
Hey, Mr. Spiritual Leader.

445
00:46:03,895 --> 00:46:06,929
Come on, calm down.

446
00:46:09,399 --> 00:46:11,567
Look, I got an idea.

447
00:46:19,076 --> 00:46:21,911
Got it?
Yeah.

448
00:46:21,913 --> 00:46:24,413
Definitely don't think he's
gonna get out of there, man.

449
00:46:24,415 --> 00:46:25,782
Are we?

450
00:46:40,798 --> 00:46:43,366
I was thinking of us
last night.

451
00:46:43,368 --> 00:46:45,368
Yeah. Me and you.

452
00:46:55,412 --> 00:46:57,380
I got something.

453
00:46:57,382 --> 00:46:58,781
<i>People are</i>
<i>being warned to stay indoors.</i>

454
00:46:58,783 --> 00:47:00,616
<i>The electrical storm</i>

455
00:47:00,618 --> 00:47:02,885
<i>has already claimed hundreds</i>
<i>of thousands of lives.</i>

456
00:47:02,887 --> 00:47:04,420
<i>Reports are still coming in</i>

457
00:47:04,422 --> 00:47:06,322
<i>from every</i>
<i>corner of the globe.</i>

458
00:47:06,324 --> 00:47:08,958
<i>Scientists remain perplexed</i>
<i>as to the cause of the eclipse</i>

459
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:11,661
<i>and how it could be visible</i>
<i>on every continent.</i>

460
00:47:11,663 --> 00:47:13,429
<i>Religious leaders</i>
<i>in Europe, India,</i>

461
00:47:13,431 --> 00:47:15,097
<i>the Middle East and America</i>

462
00:47:15,099 --> 00:47:18,401
<i>have called all peoples</i>
<i>of all faiths to pray.</i>

463
00:47:21,572 --> 00:47:22,572
How can this be possible?

464
00:47:25,242 --> 00:47:27,243
I mean, how can the eclipse be

465
00:47:27,245 --> 00:47:28,978
seen all over the world
or even, like...

466
00:47:31,715 --> 00:47:33,115
It's the wrath of God.

467
00:47:33,117 --> 00:47:38,287
Look, I wasn't
religious before but
I guess it took the
end of the world.

468
00:47:38,289 --> 00:47:39,889
Seriously, am I the only one

469
00:47:39,891 --> 00:47:41,958
that's gonna keep
their fucking head on?

470
00:47:41,960 --> 00:47:45,995
No.
Maybe Colline's right.

471
00:47:47,631 --> 00:47:48,130
Great.

472
00:47:51,635 --> 00:47:53,069
We have to save our baby.

473
00:47:56,106 --> 00:47:58,241
Are you serious?
What?

474
00:48:01,411 --> 00:48:03,279
How could you do this to me?

475
00:48:03,281 --> 00:48:05,648
Did you think
that I would never find out?

476
00:48:07,484 --> 00:48:08,918
I'm not stupid.

477
00:48:08,920 --> 00:48:10,419
Did you think that I'm stupid?

478
00:48:10,421 --> 00:48:12,188
I'm sorry!
God, I'm sorry!

479
00:48:12,190 --> 00:48:15,157
It was like the worst
year of my life.

480
00:48:15,159 --> 00:48:16,492
Yeah, it was the worst year
of my life too,

481
00:48:16,494 --> 00:48:17,760
and I didn't go running

482
00:48:17,762 --> 00:48:18,861
into the arms of somebody else.

483
00:48:20,964 --> 00:48:22,531
I'm so sorry, just forgive me.

484
00:48:22,533 --> 00:48:23,933
Ten years, man.

485
00:48:23,935 --> 00:48:25,635
Ten years of spiritual work.

486
00:48:25,637 --> 00:48:27,136
I still want to kick your ass.

487
00:48:27,138 --> 00:48:28,504
Fuck.
Fuck.

488
00:48:28,506 --> 00:48:30,339
Spiritual work, my ass.

489
00:48:30,341 --> 00:48:32,541
You're a fraud, our whole
relationship's a joke.

490
00:48:32,543 --> 00:48:34,677
We came here
because we trusted you.

491
00:48:34,679 --> 00:48:35,778
Now we're all gonna die.

492
00:48:35,780 --> 00:48:37,179
You trusted me?

493
00:48:37,181 --> 00:48:38,614
None of you trusted me!

494
00:48:38,616 --> 00:48:41,651
None of you believed in me!
Especially you.

495
00:48:41,653 --> 00:48:43,552
You know what a joke is?
You know what the fraud is?

496
00:48:43,554 --> 00:48:45,655
Right there.

497
00:48:45,657 --> 00:48:46,989
Fuck you.

498
00:48:49,793 --> 00:48:52,161
Sera, I'm sorry,

499
00:48:52,163 --> 00:48:53,796
but Marsden and I go way back.

500
00:48:53,798 --> 00:48:55,097
No. No, we don't.

501
00:48:55,099 --> 00:48:57,133
I was always
meant to have his baby.

502
00:48:57,135 --> 00:48:59,769
No. I'm not going to hear
any of that high school
abortion shit.

503
00:48:59,771 --> 00:49:01,437
We put that in the past.

504
00:49:01,439 --> 00:49:02,438
This is destiny.

505
00:49:02,440 --> 00:49:04,473
Sweetheart.

506
00:49:04,475 --> 00:49:05,875
Aaahhh!
Give it back!

507
00:49:05,877 --> 00:49:07,944
Get the fuck away from me!

508
00:49:09,446 --> 00:49:12,181
Is this a high school
promise ring?

509
00:49:12,183 --> 00:49:14,183
Have you lost your mind?

510
00:49:14,185 --> 00:49:15,685
Come on, the end of the world
is happening

511
00:49:15,687 --> 00:49:17,153
and what the fuck are we doing?

512
00:49:17,155 --> 00:49:19,155
Talking about this!

513
00:49:25,329 --> 00:49:27,296
Sera.
No, you get away from me.

514
00:49:28,732 --> 00:49:30,199
I don't know you people.

515
00:49:30,201 --> 00:49:33,002
Sera.
I don't know you.

516
00:49:33,004 --> 00:49:35,037
I love you, Sera, I'm sorry.

517
00:49:40,077 --> 00:49:41,177
Fuck!

518
00:49:43,080 --> 00:49:44,580
Why?

519
00:49:45,582 --> 00:49:47,717
Our baby.

520
00:50:03,400 --> 00:50:05,034
Sera!

521
00:50:05,036 --> 00:50:06,402
God, shit.

522
00:50:06,404 --> 00:50:07,837
Come on.

523
00:50:10,540 --> 00:50:13,009
Please, please, open the door.

524
00:50:13,011 --> 00:50:15,378
Come on.
Just leave me alone!

525
00:50:15,380 --> 00:50:19,315
I do not want you
coming in this bedroom.

526
00:50:19,317 --> 00:50:22,084
Why don't you go sleep
with Colline or Pirino

527
00:50:22,086 --> 00:50:23,853
for all I care.

528
00:50:23,855 --> 00:50:27,690
The three of you can go
doing this, whatever you do.

529
00:50:27,692 --> 00:50:28,858
Sera, I'm sorry, okay.

530
00:50:28,860 --> 00:50:31,394
Look, when Lilly died...

531
00:50:33,697 --> 00:50:36,565
I know I left.

532
00:50:36,567 --> 00:50:40,836
That was a weak move,
but I was scared, okay.

533
00:50:42,873 --> 00:50:46,509
I've been an arrogant prick

534
00:50:46,511 --> 00:50:49,712
our whole relationship,

535
00:50:49,714 --> 00:50:52,848
and it took electrical
hellfire for me to see that.

536
00:50:55,118 --> 00:50:56,886
I don't know
how you can forgive me,

537
00:50:56,888 --> 00:50:58,854
but I'm begging you, please.

538
00:51:02,626 --> 00:51:04,360
I miss you, sweetheart.

539
00:51:14,638 --> 00:51:16,272
I'm sorry, Sera.

540
00:51:30,287 --> 00:51:32,788
I am so mad at you right now.

541
00:51:41,231 --> 00:51:42,832
I mean, if this is the end...

542
00:51:42,834 --> 00:51:46,001
you know, like,
if this is really
the end of it all,

543
00:51:46,003 --> 00:51:48,671
I want you to know something.

544
00:51:53,110 --> 00:51:55,277
I'm nothing without you.

545
00:51:57,914 --> 00:52:00,783
I mean, whether
we get out of here or not,

546
00:52:00,785 --> 00:52:02,451
whether we stay
together or not,

547
00:52:02,453 --> 00:52:04,887
I'm always gonna love you.

548
00:52:06,790 --> 00:52:09,258
Nothing's ever gonna
change that.

549
00:52:09,260 --> 00:52:10,593
Not even you.

550
00:52:18,802 --> 00:52:20,402
You shouldn't have done that.

551
00:52:22,172 --> 00:52:23,739
Look who's talking.

552
00:52:23,741 --> 00:52:26,075
It's bad timing.

553
00:52:28,078 --> 00:52:29,678
We're out of time.

554
00:52:31,648 --> 00:52:32,648
You know what?

555
00:52:32,650 --> 00:52:35,084
When we get out of here,

556
00:52:35,086 --> 00:52:36,819
if we get out of here,

557
00:52:36,821 --> 00:52:39,421
me and you are gonna settle up.

558
00:52:39,423 --> 00:52:41,657
I'm so sorry, man.

559
00:52:43,793 --> 00:52:45,194
Right now we got
bigger problems.

560
00:52:45,196 --> 00:52:46,462
Come on.

561
00:52:50,967 --> 00:52:52,268
This is it.

562
00:52:52,270 --> 00:52:53,469
I found some kerosene,

563
00:52:53,471 --> 00:52:55,471
candles and a couple
of lanterns.

564
00:52:55,473 --> 00:52:56,539
It's not much.

565
00:52:58,542 --> 00:53:00,342
All our food's out there.

566
00:53:00,344 --> 00:53:03,445
Oh, great.
We still got water.

567
00:53:03,447 --> 00:53:06,849
I'm assuming
cannibalism isn't an option.

568
00:53:12,222 --> 00:53:14,356
I really screwed up, man.
I'm sorry.
Save it.

569
00:53:35,312 --> 00:53:37,613
It's just the two of us.

570
00:53:51,661 --> 00:53:53,495
We'll keep each other safe.

571
00:54:15,719 --> 00:54:18,554
What do you make
of this shit, man?

572
00:54:18,556 --> 00:54:21,123
I've been studying Tarot cards

573
00:54:21,125 --> 00:54:23,726
and symbols for years and this,

574
00:54:23,728 --> 00:54:26,161
this right here,
this freaks me out.

575
00:54:26,163 --> 00:54:28,797
How would she know about
this months in advance?

576
00:54:28,799 --> 00:54:30,466
Clear premonition.

577
00:54:30,468 --> 00:54:32,635
Oh, come on, man.
I don't believe
in that shit.

578
00:54:32,637 --> 00:54:34,203
Well, you know what?

579
00:54:34,205 --> 00:54:35,804
Your belief system needs
to get a little more flexible.

580
00:54:40,076 --> 00:54:41,210
It's that landlady.

581
00:54:42,746 --> 00:54:44,380
She owns this place.

582
00:54:44,382 --> 00:54:47,850
We figure her out,
we figure everything out.

583
00:54:47,852 --> 00:54:50,252
So now she is in charge
of the weather, huh?

584
00:54:50,254 --> 00:54:52,554
Hey, she knew about
the guy in the basement.

585
00:54:52,556 --> 00:54:54,890
What?

586
00:54:54,892 --> 00:54:58,861
What did she say
when we first pulled up?
What did she say to you?

587
00:54:58,863 --> 00:55:01,397
I don't know,
she spoke in riddles.

588
00:55:01,399 --> 00:55:02,731
You know what she said?

589
00:55:02,733 --> 00:55:07,002
She threatened me
for causing her pain.

590
00:55:11,908 --> 00:55:14,243
I'm gonna go to bed.
Well, you know what?

591
00:55:14,245 --> 00:55:18,814
It's been 36 hours,
I'm gonna get some rest.

592
00:55:18,816 --> 00:55:20,482
Maybe things will be
better in the morning.

593
00:55:27,657 --> 00:55:29,358
Sweet dreams.

594
00:57:43,760 --> 00:57:45,260
Oh.

595
00:57:45,262 --> 00:57:48,263
Oh, where's your heart?

596
00:57:48,265 --> 00:57:50,199
Where is your heart?

597
00:57:51,634 --> 00:57:53,669
I'm scared.

598
00:58:10,320 --> 00:58:11,253
Lilly?

599
00:58:33,710 --> 00:58:34,710
Lilly?

600
00:59:36,806 --> 00:59:38,173
Lilly?

601
00:59:44,881 --> 00:59:46,081
Lilly?

602
00:59:54,257 --> 00:59:56,825
Wake the fuck up!

603
01:00:08,838 --> 01:00:09,938
Sera?

604
01:00:29,726 --> 01:00:32,260
Sera.

605
01:00:59,122 --> 01:01:00,155
Sera.

606
01:01:00,157 --> 01:01:01,990
Sera.

607
01:01:01,992 --> 01:01:03,392
Oh, my God.

608
01:01:03,394 --> 01:01:04,426
You're okay.

609
01:01:04,428 --> 01:01:05,594
Oh, my God.

610
01:01:05,596 --> 01:01:07,362
Yeah. Yeah.

611
01:01:09,065 --> 01:01:10,298
Hurry up.

612
01:01:10,300 --> 01:01:11,800
Sit up, come on.

613
01:01:11,802 --> 01:01:12,968
Get your back up.
Okay.

614
01:01:14,771 --> 01:01:16,872
What the fuck was that?

615
01:01:21,644 --> 01:01:22,978
Oh, my God.

616
01:01:22,980 --> 01:01:24,479
How is he doing this?

617
01:01:24,481 --> 01:01:26,615
My baby.
Oh, my God.

618
01:01:31,087 --> 01:01:32,220
My baby's gone.

619
01:01:32,222 --> 01:01:33,388
Why is he doing this?

620
01:01:33,390 --> 01:01:36,258
My baby is gone!

621
01:01:38,395 --> 01:01:41,496
Fuck this, man!
Fuck death!

622
01:01:55,578 --> 01:01:57,079
Why did you cut the rope?

623
01:01:57,081 --> 01:01:58,580
You, it sees through you,
it will shut you up.

624
01:01:58,582 --> 01:02:00,315
Oh, you know all this bullshit?

625
01:02:00,317 --> 01:02:02,084
Yeah.
You're a liar!

626
01:02:02,086 --> 01:02:03,351
Why did you cut the rope?
Just answer that.

627
01:02:03,353 --> 01:02:04,586
He can see into your soul!

628
01:02:04,588 --> 01:02:06,455
Why did you cut the rope?
Stop!

629
01:02:06,457 --> 01:02:08,790
I'm leaving.
I'm out of here!

630
01:02:08,792 --> 01:02:09,925
Colline!

631
01:02:09,927 --> 01:02:12,094
Colline!

632
01:02:12,096 --> 01:02:14,429
No, baby, no!

633
01:02:14,431 --> 01:02:16,631
I'm glad Lilly died.

634
01:02:18,134 --> 01:02:19,801
She was a mistake.

635
01:02:19,803 --> 01:02:20,836
Fuck her!

636
01:02:20,838 --> 01:02:21,937
No!
No, hey!

637
01:02:23,273 --> 01:02:24,506
Baby, no!

638
01:02:26,542 --> 01:02:27,642
No!

639
01:02:27,644 --> 01:02:28,877
Colline, no!

640
01:02:28,879 --> 01:02:30,479
No! No!

641
01:02:38,621 --> 01:02:39,621
I know.

642
01:02:44,127 --> 01:02:45,293
I'm sorry.

643
01:02:54,036 --> 01:02:56,037
Marsden!

644
01:02:58,274 --> 01:02:59,674
Whoa, man.

645
01:02:59,676 --> 01:03:01,376
Are you out of your
fucking mind?

646
01:03:01,378 --> 01:03:02,878
Colline was right.

647
01:03:02,880 --> 01:03:04,379
Why did she cut the rope?

648
01:03:04,381 --> 01:03:05,947
Why did you cut the rope?

649
01:03:09,385 --> 01:03:12,888
Don't you take another step,
Mars, don't make me do it.

650
01:03:14,157 --> 01:03:17,392
Look, she's innocent.

651
01:03:17,394 --> 01:03:18,827
There's something
else down here, man.

652
01:03:21,197 --> 01:03:22,831
You know that.

653
01:03:25,034 --> 01:03:26,568
Pi.

654
01:03:28,738 --> 01:03:31,273
Please, this won't
bring her back.

655
01:03:31,275 --> 01:03:33,308
Please.

656
01:03:58,935 --> 01:04:00,535
Baby.

657
01:04:26,462 --> 01:04:29,464
I'm sorry.

658
01:04:29,466 --> 01:04:32,100
You know what?
I think we can cut these.

659
01:04:32,102 --> 01:04:33,869
You know, I really think
they're made out of our own

660
01:04:33,871 --> 01:04:35,136
nerve endings or something.

661
01:04:35,138 --> 01:04:36,271
How is that possible?

662
01:04:36,273 --> 01:04:38,607
How can any of this be?

663
01:04:48,251 --> 01:04:50,118
Shit.

664
01:04:50,120 --> 01:04:53,088
We have unfinished business.

665
01:04:55,992 --> 01:04:57,125
Colline?

666
01:04:57,127 --> 01:04:58,326
Shut up.

667
01:05:04,734 --> 01:05:06,067
Mars.

668
01:05:11,173 --> 01:05:12,307
What did you just do?

669
01:05:13,676 --> 01:05:16,011
I put them into time out,

670
01:05:16,013 --> 01:05:19,014
just the way
you like it, right?

671
01:05:19,016 --> 01:05:20,448
No more distractions

672
01:05:20,450 --> 01:05:23,451
from your work, right, daddy?

673
01:05:23,453 --> 01:05:26,688
You thought you could get away

674
01:05:26,690 --> 01:05:30,091
with dismissing me
the way you dismissed Lilly?

675
01:05:39,836 --> 01:05:42,904
Trying to ignore me? Really?

676
01:05:42,906 --> 01:05:46,074
You have a stitch
on the back of your neck
that leads into your brain.

677
01:05:49,445 --> 01:05:51,913
You like it, huh?
You like it.

678
01:05:51,915 --> 01:05:53,281
You like it.

679
01:05:53,283 --> 01:05:55,183
I'm sorry.

680
01:05:55,185 --> 01:05:56,351
Damn it.

681
01:05:57,687 --> 01:06:00,188
All men are puppets!

682
01:06:00,190 --> 01:06:03,925
<i>That is the infinite abyss</i>
<i>of pure nonexistence!</i>

683
01:06:06,429 --> 01:06:08,797
How does it feel to be
fucked and thrown aside

684
01:06:08,799 --> 01:06:10,298
like a piece of shit, huh?

685
01:06:12,468 --> 01:06:14,703
How does it feel to be
fucked and thrown aside

686
01:06:14,705 --> 01:06:16,204
like a piece of shit?

687
01:06:18,207 --> 01:06:21,977
Look, Colline, I'm so sorry.

688
01:06:21,979 --> 01:06:23,345
<i>Death is...</i>

689
01:06:23,347 --> 01:06:24,980
<i>No heaven, no hell.</i>

690
01:06:24,982 --> 01:06:27,482
<i>No afterlife, no reincarnation.</i>

691
01:06:27,484 --> 01:06:28,817
<i>No other side.</i>

692
01:06:34,724 --> 01:06:35,724
<i>Say it!</i>

693
01:06:37,727 --> 01:06:39,461
<i>Drop your spiritual beliefs.</i>

694
01:06:39,463 --> 01:06:42,364
Our hearts have
descended together to dance

695
01:06:42,366 --> 01:06:47,035
in the fires of hell
for all eternity.

696
01:06:57,413 --> 01:06:59,347
I'm sorry.

697
01:06:59,349 --> 01:07:01,349
You took a piece of me.

698
01:07:01,351 --> 01:07:04,552
Now it's time
to return the favor.

699
01:07:10,660 --> 01:07:11,860
You like that.

700
01:07:56,505 --> 01:07:59,274
God, please, just tell me how
the fuck to get out of this!

701
01:07:59,276 --> 01:08:00,909
Please!

702
01:08:10,419 --> 01:08:11,686
Fuck!

703
01:09:07,910 --> 01:09:10,678
This is your fault.

704
01:09:10,680 --> 01:09:13,114
My fault?

705
01:09:13,116 --> 01:09:16,017
You're the one that wanted us
to come on death trip,

706
01:09:16,019 --> 01:09:21,089
bring us all the way out here,
meditate on death.

707
01:09:21,091 --> 01:09:23,158
This is your fault, man.

708
01:09:23,160 --> 01:09:24,659
It's not my fault.

709
01:09:27,296 --> 01:09:28,496
Death found us.

710
01:09:31,066 --> 01:09:32,934
Death found us.

711
01:09:32,936 --> 01:09:34,102
Shit!

712
01:09:47,950 --> 01:09:48,950
Lilly...

713
01:09:51,020 --> 01:09:53,021
Baby, if you can
hear me right now...

714
01:09:58,160 --> 01:10:00,195
You have to cross over, baby.

715
01:10:04,800 --> 01:10:07,368
I love you so much.

716
01:10:07,370 --> 01:10:09,137
You have to let go of us.

717
01:10:25,087 --> 01:10:26,421
I saw something out there.

718
01:10:31,594 --> 01:10:33,595
There's just no one out there.

719
01:10:33,597 --> 01:10:34,963
No.

720
01:10:34,965 --> 01:10:35,964
There's something out there.

721
01:10:39,835 --> 01:10:41,669
We have to help her cross over.

722
01:10:45,975 --> 01:10:47,208
Okay.

723
01:10:53,349 --> 01:10:54,816
I don't want to die here.

724
01:10:57,620 --> 01:11:00,054
We'll make it out of here,
I promise.

725
01:11:16,238 --> 01:11:17,872
It's good to see you
two together again.

726
01:11:20,643 --> 01:11:21,843
Maybe you're right.

727
01:11:24,380 --> 01:11:26,014
Maybe I started all this.

728
01:11:28,484 --> 01:11:30,385
I'm gonna end it.

729
01:11:30,387 --> 01:11:32,487
Where are you going, man?

730
01:11:32,489 --> 01:11:33,655
To hell.

731
01:11:43,866 --> 01:11:45,099
What is it?

732
01:12:00,249 --> 01:12:01,482
It's ball lightning.

733
01:12:06,255 --> 01:12:08,523
It's beautiful.

734
01:12:08,525 --> 01:12:10,591
Not as beautiful as you.

735
01:13:35,944 --> 01:13:37,645
Ah!

736
01:13:39,649 --> 01:13:41,315
No!

737
01:13:41,317 --> 01:13:43,050
I'm gonna fucking kill you!

738
01:13:44,219 --> 01:13:45,653
Aah!

739
01:13:53,729 --> 01:13:54,796
Oh, no.

740
01:13:54,798 --> 01:13:58,065
No, no, no, no, P.

741
01:13:58,067 --> 01:13:59,066
You okay?

742
01:14:02,005 --> 01:14:03,938
Hey, hey, hey.

743
01:14:03,940 --> 01:14:05,506
No, no, no.
Look at me.

744
01:14:05,508 --> 01:14:06,674
Look at me.

745
01:14:06,676 --> 01:14:08,142
Look at me.
Look at me.

746
01:14:08,144 --> 01:14:09,510
Look at me.

747
01:14:10,646 --> 01:14:12,013
It's okay. It's okay.

748
01:14:13,082 --> 01:14:15,683
Fuck.
Oh, my God.

749
01:14:59,194 --> 01:15:00,828
No!

750
01:15:00,830 --> 01:15:02,096
Don't!

751
01:15:02,098 --> 01:15:03,498
Wait!

752
01:15:03,500 --> 01:15:05,032
Shit!

753
01:15:12,474 --> 01:15:14,208
Wait, wait.
Please.

754
01:16:07,896 --> 01:16:09,497
What have we done?

755
01:16:19,041 --> 01:16:20,107
Fuck.

756
01:16:39,027 --> 01:16:41,662
♪ Row, row, row your boat ♪

757
01:16:41,664 --> 01:16:44,031
♪ Gently down the stream ♪

758
01:16:44,033 --> 01:16:50,037
♪ Merrily, merrily, merrily,
merrily, life is but a dream ♪

759
01:16:59,014 --> 01:17:02,016
♪ Row, row, row your boat ♪

760
01:17:02,018 --> 01:17:04,018
♪ Gently down the stream ♪

761
01:17:04,020 --> 01:17:09,857
♪ Merrily, merrily, merrily,
merrily, life is but a dream ♪

762
01:17:21,570 --> 01:17:23,437
Oh, fuck you.

763
01:17:24,539 --> 01:17:26,407
Fuck you.

764
01:17:26,409 --> 01:17:28,909
Whoever is doing this,
fuck you!

765
01:17:32,714 --> 01:17:33,981
But remember...

766
01:17:36,051 --> 01:17:38,319
...the pain you birth

767
01:17:38,321 --> 01:17:40,621
hunts you down in the end.

768
01:17:40,623 --> 01:17:45,326
The pain you birth is the pain
that hunts us down in the end.

769
01:17:45,328 --> 01:17:46,327
What?

770
01:17:48,330 --> 01:17:50,297
It's not Lilly
who needs to be saved.

771
01:17:52,300 --> 01:17:54,568
Baby, it's us.

772
01:17:54,570 --> 01:17:56,170
What did we do?

773
01:18:00,108 --> 01:18:02,543
Let me go, I'm scared.

774
01:18:02,545 --> 01:18:03,878
Mommy.

775
01:18:13,155 --> 01:18:14,588
Lilly?

776
01:18:30,806 --> 01:18:32,239
My God, Sera.

777
01:18:32,241 --> 01:18:34,108
Sera.

778
01:18:34,110 --> 01:18:36,110
Quantum physics.

779
01:18:36,112 --> 01:18:38,112
That's what it's got to be.

780
01:18:39,748 --> 01:18:41,682
We've been, like, sucked into

781
01:18:41,684 --> 01:18:44,085
a parallel universe
or something.

782
01:18:44,087 --> 01:18:46,821
No, no.

783
01:18:46,823 --> 01:18:48,255
I won't let you.

784
01:18:48,257 --> 01:18:49,623
No, come on,
I can hear, please.

785
01:18:49,625 --> 01:18:53,160
No, the thing up there
is not her.

786
01:18:53,162 --> 01:18:55,629
No, it's not Lilly.
It's not.

787
01:19:08,610 --> 01:19:10,978
Sera, listen,
I know what this is.

788
01:19:10,980 --> 01:19:12,613
What?

789
01:19:12,615 --> 01:19:15,316
We have to ask
for Lilly's forgiveness.
Why?

790
01:19:15,318 --> 01:19:16,884
We were terrible parents.

791
01:19:16,886 --> 01:19:17,885
Oh, no.

792
01:19:17,887 --> 01:19:19,153
Yes, we were.

793
01:19:19,155 --> 01:19:20,821
We always put ourselves first.

794
01:19:20,823 --> 01:19:23,691
No, we gave her everything.
No, no!

795
01:19:23,693 --> 01:19:26,994
We treated her like a doll,
a disposable doll, Sera.

796
01:19:26,996 --> 01:19:29,663
No. Pirino, he drugged us.
He drugged us.

797
01:19:29,665 --> 01:19:31,899
What?
Yeah.

798
01:19:31,901 --> 01:19:33,634
Yeah, can't you get it?
We're walking around
our own house

799
01:19:33,636 --> 01:19:35,636
and we can't even recognize it.

800
01:19:37,873 --> 01:19:40,141
Lilly's still alive.

801
01:19:40,143 --> 01:19:42,376
She's still alive.

802
01:19:42,378 --> 01:19:44,545
What's wrong?
Can't you feel it? Come on.

803
01:19:59,895 --> 01:20:02,296
Baby.

804
01:20:02,298 --> 01:20:04,665
It's okay.

805
01:20:04,667 --> 01:20:07,501
Me and Daddy are here.

806
01:20:07,503 --> 01:20:09,470
You're safe now.

807
01:20:35,597 --> 01:20:36,997
Sera!

808
01:20:39,568 --> 01:20:42,570
Sera!

809
01:20:42,572 --> 01:20:44,572
Sera!

810
01:20:44,574 --> 01:20:50,211
Let her out!
Let her out of there!

811
01:21:01,189 --> 01:21:02,223
Lilly...

812
01:21:06,061 --> 01:21:07,328
Is that you?

813
01:21:34,556 --> 01:21:36,357
My poor baby.

814
01:21:40,562 --> 01:21:41,962
It's my fault.

815
01:21:48,970 --> 01:21:50,804
It's your daddy's fault.

816
01:21:55,944 --> 01:21:57,811
How can you forgive me?

817
01:22:06,621 --> 01:22:09,256
Just take me.

818
01:22:32,480 --> 01:22:34,081
We have missed you.

819
01:22:34,083 --> 01:22:36,350
You missed me?

820
01:22:36,352 --> 01:22:38,819
You must all return,
no matter what.

821
01:22:38,821 --> 01:22:40,454
Return where?

822
01:22:40,456 --> 01:22:42,723
You know where.

823
01:22:42,725 --> 01:22:44,124
No, I don't.

824
01:22:47,262 --> 01:22:49,830
This is real.

825
01:22:49,832 --> 01:22:51,231
How would it be?

826
01:22:53,268 --> 01:22:54,501
I'm a human.

827
01:22:56,137 --> 01:22:59,340
Are you?

828
01:22:59,342 --> 01:23:00,507
Of course I am.

829
01:23:02,143 --> 01:23:03,911
What the fuck
are you talking about?

830
01:23:03,913 --> 01:23:07,481
Self deception is a cruel mess.

831
01:23:07,483 --> 01:23:10,150
Tell me what the fuck
is going on!

832
01:23:34,943 --> 01:23:36,610
You know what's there.

833
01:24:09,878 --> 01:24:13,180
You're back.
This is today.

834
01:24:16,017 --> 01:24:17,551
Am I dead?

835
01:24:17,553 --> 01:24:18,552
No.

836
01:24:22,257 --> 01:24:23,824
Then where am I?

837
01:24:23,826 --> 01:24:25,826
Hell.

838
01:24:25,828 --> 01:24:27,761
You don't have to die
to get there.

839
01:24:33,835 --> 01:24:37,838
How the fuck can I be there

840
01:24:37,840 --> 01:24:40,040
and here at the same time?

841
01:24:40,042 --> 01:24:45,412
How can anyone
be anywhere at any time?

842
01:24:45,414 --> 01:24:48,348
This is the mystery
of consciousness.

843
01:24:50,018 --> 01:24:53,020
You can occupy
many bodies at once.

844
01:24:53,022 --> 01:24:54,855
Some physical, some ethereal...

845
01:24:56,591 --> 01:24:59,460
but ultimately an illusion.

846
01:25:01,463 --> 01:25:05,365
<i>A part of you is in</i>
<i>Lilly's subconscious now</i>

847
01:25:05,367 --> 01:25:06,967
<i>in her dying</i>
<i>mental images.</i>

848
01:25:09,437 --> 01:25:12,940
<i>Your lives</i>
<i>that feel so real</i>

849
01:25:12,942 --> 01:25:16,944
<i>are merely dreams</i>
<i>within dreams,</i>

850
01:25:16,946 --> 01:25:21,081
<i>rising and collapsing</i>
<i>like waves</i>

851
01:25:21,083 --> 01:25:23,117
<i>in the ocean of</i>
<i>consciousness.</i>

852
01:25:25,887 --> 01:25:29,990
<i>You and Lilly</i>
<i>are right here...</i>

853
01:25:29,992 --> 01:25:32,392
<i>right now.</i>

854
01:25:32,394 --> 01:25:35,496
Crystallized into form

855
01:25:35,498 --> 01:25:38,732
by the power of
your mutual pain.

856
01:25:54,215 --> 01:25:55,249
Tell me...

857
01:25:58,620 --> 01:26:00,888
What kind of god

858
01:26:00,890 --> 01:26:03,390
would make
a fucking place like this?

859
01:26:03,392 --> 01:26:05,926
You tell me that.
Tell me!

860
01:26:05,928 --> 01:26:09,129
The god you dreamed up!

861
01:26:09,131 --> 01:26:13,967
Suffer or surrender.

862
01:26:13,969 --> 01:26:15,802
It is always your choice.

863
01:26:37,625 --> 01:26:39,293
It was never locked.

864
01:27:08,723 --> 01:27:12,059
<i>Why don't you turn</i>
<i>the light of your attention</i>

865
01:27:12,061 --> 01:27:14,394
<i>back onto</i>
<i>your own shadow?</i>

866
01:27:43,125 --> 01:27:44,458
What happened?

867
01:27:44,460 --> 01:27:47,561
Oh, man.
What? What?

868
01:27:47,563 --> 01:27:49,563
Put a little less pedal
on that metal.

869
01:27:52,066 --> 01:27:54,668
You guys were the ones
that wanted to leave Vegas.

870
01:27:54,670 --> 01:27:56,169
I wanted to stay.

871
01:27:56,171 --> 01:27:57,838
Yeah, well, we just want
to get home in one piece.

872
01:27:57,840 --> 01:28:00,474
Oh, my God.
Get off his back, he's fine.

873
01:28:00,476 --> 01:28:03,510
Hey, Lilly Willy,
you want to drive?

874
01:28:03,512 --> 01:28:04,711
Hey, no, no, no,
put your seat...

875
01:28:20,061 --> 01:28:22,029
She's awake.
Oh, my God.

876
01:28:31,739 --> 01:28:33,507
Look, we're doing
everything that we can.

877
01:28:35,443 --> 01:28:37,511
And we're gonna keep trying.

878
01:28:49,490 --> 01:28:50,724
There was, um...

879
01:29:01,569 --> 01:29:04,504
There was another car,
and, um...

880
01:29:06,074 --> 01:29:09,209
There was no other driver.
It was me.

881
01:29:09,211 --> 01:29:10,844
Yes, there was.

882
01:29:10,846 --> 01:29:12,446
It jumped the median
and it wasn't our fault.

883
01:29:12,448 --> 01:29:13,680
It wasn't our fault.

884
01:29:16,017 --> 01:29:17,684
I can't lose
you right now, please,

885
01:29:17,686 --> 01:29:18,785
I can't lose you right now.

886
01:30:15,076 --> 01:30:16,510
I'm sorry.

887
01:30:19,614 --> 01:30:21,748
I don't know
how I got to this realization.

888
01:30:24,585 --> 01:30:29,389
This. This,
we can't do this anymore.

889
01:30:30,625 --> 01:30:31,925
God, no, listen.

890
01:30:36,931 --> 01:30:38,932
We did it.

891
01:30:38,934 --> 01:30:40,634
What?

892
01:30:40,636 --> 01:30:42,669
There was no other car.

893
01:30:42,671 --> 01:30:43,804
You know there wasn't.

894
01:30:43,806 --> 01:30:45,071
No.

895
01:30:45,073 --> 01:30:46,072
Yes.

896
01:30:46,074 --> 01:30:47,140
Yes.
Come on.

897
01:30:47,142 --> 01:30:49,242
No, no.

898
01:30:49,244 --> 01:30:51,278
Yes, there was and I do not
want to talk about this.

899
01:30:51,280 --> 01:30:53,413
You wanted me to lie.

900
01:30:53,415 --> 01:30:54,781
There's no way to know it.

901
01:30:54,783 --> 01:30:56,316
Listen.

902
01:30:56,318 --> 01:30:58,952
We're just killing ourselves.

903
01:30:58,954 --> 01:31:01,087
Look at this shit.

904
01:31:01,089 --> 01:31:02,189
Look at it.

905
01:31:06,093 --> 01:31:08,595
There was no other car.

906
01:31:11,098 --> 01:31:14,534
Sera, listen to me.

907
01:31:14,536 --> 01:31:19,172
I'm so sick and tired
of killing ourselves...

908
01:31:21,642 --> 01:31:23,610
with guilt.

909
01:31:23,612 --> 01:31:25,846
I can't do it anymore.

910
01:31:25,848 --> 01:31:28,715
I can't watch
this happen to you.

911
01:31:35,957 --> 01:31:37,224
Or to me.

912
01:31:44,665 --> 01:31:47,567
It's gonna get better.

913
01:31:47,569 --> 01:31:49,069
It's gonna get better.

914
