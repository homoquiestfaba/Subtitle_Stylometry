1
00:00:28,728 --> 00:00:31,897
IT ALL STARTED WITH A SECRET.

2
00:00:31,899 --> 00:00:33,365
WE ALL HAVE THEM.

3
00:00:33,367 --> 00:00:36,268
EVERYONE'S IS DIFFERENT.

4
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:39,238
MOST SECRETS DON'T CARRY MUCH
WEIGHT.

5
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:39,705
BUT SOME...

6
00:00:39,707 --> 00:00:43,709
SOME SECRETS CAN DESTROY
EVERYTHING YOU LOVE.

7
00:02:48,035 --> 00:02:50,035
WHY?

8
00:02:50,037 --> 00:02:53,539
WHY, DAVID?

9
00:02:53,541 --> 00:02:55,007
WHY?!

10
00:03:56,069 --> 00:03:59,304
ARE YOU WATCHING
THE SUNRISE ALONE?

11
00:03:59,306 --> 00:04:00,706
THAT'S NO FUN.

12
00:04:00,708 --> 00:04:02,407
>> NO, I WAS JUST THINKING.

13
00:04:02,409 --> 00:04:05,143
>> ARE YOU GETTING COLD FEET?

14
00:04:05,145 --> 00:04:05,844
>> NO.

15
00:04:05,846 --> 00:04:07,779
NO, I WAS JUST THINKING HOW

16
00:04:07,781 --> 00:04:09,748
LUCKY I AM TO HAVE YOU.

17
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:10,482
AWW.

18
00:04:10,484 --> 00:04:13,252
FLATTERY WILL GET YOU
EVERYWHERE.

19
00:04:20,194 --> 00:04:22,194
DO YOU WANT TO GO EXPLORE THE

20
00:04:22,196 --> 00:04:23,695
CITY WHILE I FIND JILL?

21
00:04:23,697 --> 00:04:26,031
NO, I'D RATHER EXPLORE YOU.

22
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:28,066
WE HAVE A TRADITION, REMEMBER?

23
00:04:28,068 --> 00:04:29,234
FOR EVERY NEW STAMP ON THE

24
00:04:29,236 --> 00:04:30,836
PASSPORT, WE NEED TO LEAVE OUR

25
00:04:30,838 --> 00:04:31,570
MARK ON THE COUNTRY.

26
00:04:31,572 --> 00:04:33,372
HOW MANY STAMPS DO YOU HAVE
NOW?

27
00:04:34,174 --> 00:04:36,074
NOT NEARLY ENOUGH.

28
00:05:35,234 --> 00:05:36,768
THAT WAS SO CHEESY.

29
00:05:36,770 --> 00:05:37,602
WHAT? WHAT WAS CHEESY?

30
00:05:37,604 --> 00:05:39,304
"INTERNATIONAL EFFORT"?

31
00:05:39,306 --> 00:05:40,372
WELL, WHAT IS IT?

32
00:06:28,721 --> 00:06:31,656
DAD!

33
00:06:31,658 --> 00:06:33,325
UH..

34
00:06:33,327 --> 00:06:34,593
HOW DID YOU FIND ME?

35
00:06:34,595 --> 00:06:35,827
I PAY YOUR CREDIT-CARD BILLS,
REMEMBER?

36
00:06:35,829 --> 00:06:36,561
I ALWAYS KNOW WHERE YOU ARE.

37
00:06:36,563 --> 00:06:38,230
DAVID, WHAT A SURPRISE.

38
00:06:38,232 --> 00:06:39,464
GINA, YOU DIDN'T GET ANY OF

39
00:06:39,466 --> 00:06:40,799
MY VOICEMAIL MESSAGES,

40
00:06:40,801 --> 00:06:41,400
APPARENTLY.

41
00:06:41,402 --> 00:06:42,067
MESSAGES? NO.

42
00:06:42,069 --> 00:06:43,101
LAUREN, THIS IS GINA.

43
00:06:43,103 --> 00:06:44,169
SHE WAS MARCELA'S SISTER.

44
00:06:44,171 --> 00:06:45,303
WELL, I'M STILL HER SISTER.

45
00:06:45,305 --> 00:06:46,872
HOW ARE YOU? NICE TO MEET YOU.

46
00:06:46,874 --> 00:06:48,039
DAVID'S TOLD ME SO MUCH

47
00:06:48,041 --> 00:06:48,640
ABOUT MARCELA.

48
00:06:48,642 --> 00:06:50,275
IT SOUNDS LIKE SHE WAS AN
AMAZING WOMAN.

49
00:06:50,277 --> 00:06:51,143
SHE WAS.

50
00:06:51,145 --> 00:06:52,344
UH, YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE COME,

51
00:06:52,346 --> 00:06:52,844
DAD.

52
00:06:52,846 --> 00:06:53,545
YOU THINK WE WANT TO BE HERE?

53
00:06:53,547 --> 00:06:54,646
WE HAVE A WEDDING IN EIGHT DAYS.

54
00:06:54,648 --> 00:06:55,614
YOU'RE NOT MISSING THAT, AND

55
00:06:55,616 --> 00:06:56,815
YOU'RE DEFINITELY NOT GONNA MISS

56
00:06:56,817 --> 00:06:57,649
YOUR FRESHMAN YEAR AT --

57
00:06:57,651 --> 00:06:58,383
WELL, I'M NOT GOING HOME.

58
00:06:58,385 --> 00:06:59,785
JILL, I'M NOT MARRYING DAVID

59
00:06:59,787 --> 00:07:00,552
WITHOUT YOU THERE.

60
00:07:00,554 --> 00:07:01,386
SURE YOU'RE NOT.

61
00:07:01,388 --> 00:07:04,022
JILL.

62
00:07:04,024 --> 00:07:06,191
OKAY, WHY DON'T WE RELAX A
LITTLE BIT?

63
00:07:06,193 --> 00:07:07,426
DON'T TELL ME TO RELAX, GINA.

64
00:07:07,428 --> 00:07:09,127
YOU'RE HER AUNT.
YOU KNEW SHE WAS SUPPOSED TO BE

65
00:07:09,129 --> 00:07:09,594
HOME A WEEK AGO.

66
00:07:09,596 --> 00:07:10,796
YOU COULD HAVE PUT HER ON A

67
00:07:10,798 --> 00:07:11,296
PLANE.

68
00:07:11,298 --> 00:07:12,063
OKAY, DON'T BLAME HER.

69
00:07:12,065 --> 00:07:12,764
JUST GRAB YOUR STUFF.

70
00:07:12,766 --> 00:07:14,332
WE'RE FLYING OUT OF BOGOTá
TONIGHT.

71
00:07:14,334 --> 00:07:15,000
NO, WE'RE NOT.

72
00:07:15,002 --> 00:07:17,436
MY PASSPORT'S BACK AT GINA'S IN
MEDICI.

73
00:07:17,438 --> 00:07:18,203
IT'S TRUE.

74
00:07:18,205 --> 00:07:19,104
OF COURSE IT IS.

75
00:07:19,106 --> 00:07:20,806
HOW FAR IS THAT?
UM --

76
00:07:20,808 --> 00:07:22,941
HEY.

77
00:07:25,579 --> 00:07:27,779
THAT DOESN'T SOUND VERY GOOD.
WHO IS THIS?

78
00:07:27,781 --> 00:07:28,513
RAMON.

79
00:07:28,515 --> 00:07:29,214
RAYMOND.

80
00:07:30,384 --> 00:07:31,349
MY CAMERAMAN.

81
00:07:31,351 --> 00:07:33,585
AND, UH, MY BOYFRIEND.

82
00:07:34,087 --> 00:07:36,087
THAT DOESN'T SOUND VERY GOOD,
EITHER.

83
00:07:39,426 --> 00:07:40,859
I UNDERSTAND YOU'RE ANGRY,

84
00:07:40,861 --> 00:07:42,327
BUT WHETHER YOU LIKE IT OR NOT,

85
00:07:42,329 --> 00:07:43,061
SHE'S 18 NOW.

86
00:07:43,063 --> 00:07:45,030
SHE'S TESTING A LITTLE BIT OF
INDEPENDENCE.

87
00:07:45,032 --> 00:07:46,898
JUST GIVE HER SOME SPACE.
THAT'S IT.

88
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:48,934
I'LL GIVE HER SPACE AFTER
COLLEGE.

89
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:51,269
SHE'S SUCH A GREAT KID.

90
00:07:52,406 --> 00:07:53,872
CAN KEEP HER CLOSE SO I CAN KEEP

91
00:07:53,874 --> 00:07:55,707
AN EYE ON HER, MAKE SURE SHE'S
SAFE.

92
00:07:55,709 --> 00:07:56,308
THAT'S ALL.

93
00:07:56,310 --> 00:07:57,742
CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG.

94
00:07:57,744 --> 00:07:58,844
YOU WENT BACKPACKING THROUGH

95
00:07:58,846 --> 00:08:00,545
EUROPE WHEN YOU WERE IN COLLEGE,
RIGHT?

96
00:08:00,547 --> 00:08:02,113
THAT'S WHEN YOU MET MARCELA,

97
00:08:02,115 --> 00:08:02,681
HMM?

98
00:08:02,683 --> 00:08:03,381
WAS THAT SAFE?

99
00:08:03,383 --> 00:08:04,983
>> WHY WOULD SHE SUDDENLY WANT

100
00:08:04,985 --> 00:08:05,851
TO SKIP THE WEDDING?

101
00:08:05,853 --> 00:08:07,652
HAS SHE SAID ANYTHING TO YOU?

102
00:08:07,654 --> 00:08:09,621
YEAH.

103
00:08:09,623 --> 00:08:11,623
AND?
AND WHAT?

104
00:08:11,625 --> 00:08:13,892
WHAT DID SHE SAY?

105
00:08:13,894 --> 00:08:15,494
LET'S HEAR IT.

106
00:08:15,496 --> 00:08:17,229
OKAY.
YOU'RE ON HER FACEBOOK AS "A

107
00:08:17,231 --> 00:08:19,331
GOLD-DIGGING BITCH MARRYING MY
DAD."

108
00:08:19,333 --> 00:08:22,067
WHY THE HELL WOULD SHE SAY
THAT?
I MEAN --

109
00:08:22,069 --> 00:08:23,368
NO, NO, NO, NO. SHUSH.

110
00:08:23,370 --> 00:08:24,936
I COMPLETELY GET IT.

111
00:08:24,938 --> 00:08:26,705
I'M NOT TRYING TO REPLACE

112
00:08:26,707 --> 00:08:28,273
MARCELA, AND I NEVER WILL.

113
00:08:33,814 --> 00:08:34,746
WHY IS HE STILL WITH US?

114
00:08:34,748 --> 00:08:37,449
RELAX A LITTLE BIT, PLEASE.
I TOLD YOU.

115
00:08:37,451 --> 00:08:38,583
HE'S MY CAMERAMAN.

116
00:08:38,585 --> 00:08:39,251
HE'S A GOOD GUY.

117
00:08:39,253 --> 00:08:40,986
HE'S JUST HER SUMMER BOYFRIEND.

118
00:08:40,988 --> 00:08:41,887
WHAT'S ALL THE FUZZ ABOUT?

119
00:08:41,889 --> 00:08:44,289
OF COURSE, THAT'S WHAT MY SISTER
SAID ABOUT YOU AT FIRST.

120
00:08:44,291 --> 00:08:46,691
THAT'S WHAT I'M WORRIED
ABOUT.

121
00:08:46,693 --> 00:08:48,126
I DON'T WANT HER HAVING BABIES

122
00:08:48,128 --> 00:08:49,060
AT 18 LIKE US.

123
00:08:49,062 --> 00:08:49,628
COME ON.

124
00:08:49,630 --> 00:08:52,697
SHE WON'T, BELIEVE ME.

125
00:08:52,699 --> 00:08:54,299
OKAY, REMEMBER THAT TRIP TO

126
00:08:54,301 --> 00:08:54,733
VEGAS?

127
00:08:54,735 --> 00:08:56,768
YOU AND MARCELA WERE TAKING
SHROOMS.

128
00:08:56,770 --> 00:08:58,436
YOU USED TO DO THAT, RIGHT?

129
00:08:58,438 --> 00:08:59,838
NO.
YEAH, RIGHT.

130
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:00,572
SHH.

131
00:09:00,574 --> 00:09:01,373
NO, I WASN'T.

132
00:09:01,375 --> 00:09:02,841
I BET YOU DO. 

133
00:09:02,843 --> 00:09:04,576
AND MY SISTER WENT ALL CRAZY

134
00:09:04,578 --> 00:09:05,844
ABOUT THE PARK BUSES.

135
00:09:05,846 --> 00:09:06,344
YOU KNOW WHAT?

136
00:09:06,346 --> 00:09:08,246
THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT JILL NEEDS

137
00:09:08,248 --> 00:09:10,515
TO KEEP HER SPIRIT ALIVE.

138
00:09:10,517 --> 00:09:11,783
SHE WANTS TO TALK ABOUT HER.

139
00:09:11,785 --> 00:09:12,751
SHE SAYS YOU DON'T TALK ABOUT

140
00:09:12,753 --> 00:09:13,218
HER ANYMORE.

141
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:13,919
IT'S IMPORTANT FOR HER.

142
00:09:13,921 --> 00:09:15,854
GINA, ARE YOU SURE THIS ROAD
IS SAFE?

143
00:09:15,856 --> 00:09:17,155
ISN'T FARC AROUND HERE?

144
00:09:17,157 --> 00:09:17,789
FARC? NO, NO.

145
00:09:17,791 --> 00:09:19,524
NO, WE'VE GOTTEN RID OF MOST OF
THEM?

146
00:09:19,526 --> 00:09:20,225
"MOST"?

147
00:09:22,763 --> 00:09:23,995
SORRY, SORRY.

148
00:09:23,997 --> 00:09:26,064
WELCOME TO COLOMBIA.

149
00:09:26,533 --> 00:09:28,333
GINA, WHY DON'T YOU LET, UM,

150
00:09:28,335 --> 00:09:30,335
DAVID DRIVE FOR A BIT SO YOU CAN

151
00:09:30,337 --> 00:09:31,036
HAVE A REST?

152
00:09:31,038 --> 00:09:32,304
DO YOU WANT ME TO?

153
00:09:32,306 --> 00:09:33,405
I DON'T MIND.

154
00:09:33,407 --> 00:09:35,407
OKAY.

155
00:09:36,475 --> 00:09:37,175
FANCY WEDDING, HUH?

156
00:09:37,177 --> 00:09:39,377
SOUNDS LIKE BUSINESS IS GOING
WELL.

157
00:09:39,379 --> 00:09:39,778
I'M GLAD.

158
00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:41,012
>> BETTER TO BE THE AGENCY OWNER

159
00:09:41,014 --> 00:09:42,314
THAN ANOTHER PHOTO JOURNALIST

160
00:09:42,316 --> 00:09:43,548
SLUGGING IT THROUGH WAR ZONES.

161
00:09:43,550 --> 00:09:45,450
HAVE YOU SEEN HIS PICTURES?

162
00:09:45,452 --> 00:09:45,850
YEAH.

163
00:09:45,852 --> 00:09:46,918
YOUR BOOK WAS FANTASTIC.

164
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:48,119
I MEAN, IT'S ONE OF THE BEST

165
00:09:48,121 --> 00:09:50,088
I'VE EVER SEEN IN MY LIFE, I
SWEAR.

166
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:51,756
YOUR SISTER USED TO TELL ME I

167
00:09:51,758 --> 00:09:52,524
SPENT TOO MUCH TIME DOCUMENTING

168
00:09:52,526 --> 00:09:56,328
LIFE AND NOT ENOUGH TIME LIVING
IT, SO I'M WORKING ON THAT.

169
00:09:56,330 --> 00:09:57,295
GOOD.

170
00:09:57,297 --> 00:09:58,530
I LIKE YOUR BRACELET.

171
00:09:58,532 --> 00:09:59,364
REALLY? HMM.

172
00:09:59,366 --> 00:10:00,565
HERE. YOU CAN HAVE IT.

173
00:10:00,567 --> 00:10:01,466
DON'T BE SILLY.

174
00:10:01,468 --> 00:10:01,900
IT'S A GIFT.

175
00:10:01,902 --> 00:10:03,234
AT LEAST YOU'LL HAVE SOMETHING

176
00:10:03,236 --> 00:10:04,736
TO REMEMBER FROM MY COUNTRY.

177
00:10:04,738 --> 00:10:06,771
THANK YOU.

178
00:10:06,773 --> 00:10:08,907
THERE YOU GO.

179
00:10:08,909 --> 00:10:10,075
IS IT OKAY IF I SMOKE?

180
00:10:10,077 --> 00:10:11,743
OH! 

181
00:10:11,745 --> 00:10:12,811
NO, NO, NO, NO.

182
00:10:12,813 --> 00:10:15,680
NO ONE'S SMOKING, OKAY? SORRY.

183
00:10:15,682 --> 00:10:16,748
AND, JILL, PLEASE SPEAK ENGLISH

184
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:19,184
SO LAUREN AND I CAN JOIN IN THE
CONVERSATION.

185
00:10:19,987 --> 00:10:23,321
OH, SHIT.

186
00:10:27,727 --> 00:10:30,328

00:10:53,086 --> 00:10:54,552
HE ASKED WHERE WE'RE GOING,

194
00:10:54,554 --> 00:10:55,553
NOT WHERE WE'RE FROM.

195
00:11:00,193 --> 00:11:01,292

196
00:11:01,294 --> 00:11:02,227

I KNOW THIS ROAD PERFECTLY.

204
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:28,053

211
00:11:41,301 --> 00:11:42,967
NOW WE MIGHT NOT MAKE OUR
FLIGHT.

212
00:11:42,969 --> 00:11:43,935
WHERE'S THE MAIN ROAD?

213
00:11:43,937 --> 00:11:44,836

372
00:25:52,485 --> 00:25:54,218
I DON'T LIKE THIS, JILL.

373
00:26:02,794 --> 00:26:05,129
OH, MY GOD.

375
00:26:50,275 --> 00:26:53,243
FELIPE?

376
00:26:53,245 --> 00:26:55,479
>> Sí.

377
00:27:12,465 --> 00:27:13,664
>> AAH!

378
00:27:23,308 --> 00:27:24,642
WHAT ARE YOU TALK--

379
00:27:24,644 --> 00:27:27,344
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?!

380
00:27:28,413 --> 00:27:29,446
YOU CRAZY FUCK!

381
00:27:29,448 --> 00:27:31,348
SHE'S JUST A LITTLE GIRL!

382
00:27:31,350 --> 00:27:32,149
AAH!

383
00:27:32,151 --> 00:27:34,752
WHAT THE HELL YOU DOING DOWN
HERE? WHY'D HE HAVE A
GUN ON YOU?

384
00:27:34,754 --> 00:27:37,521
DAD, HE'S GOT A LITTLE GIRL
IN THERE.

385
00:27:37,523 --> 00:27:38,822
WE HAVE TO GET HER OUT.

386
00:27:38,824 --> 00:27:42,626
WHAT?

387
00:27:42,628 --> 00:27:44,862
LOOK.

388
00:27:59,544 --> 00:28:00,844
POINT THIS AT THE LOCK.

389
00:28:00,846 --> 00:28:02,846
OKAY.

390
00:28:28,139 --> 00:28:31,809
JESUS.

391
00:28:31,811 --> 00:28:33,577
OH, MY GOD.

392
00:28:33,579 --> 00:28:36,113
PUT HER DOWN.

393
00:28:36,115 --> 00:28:37,581
WHO IS SHE?
HER NAME'S ANA MARIA.

394
00:28:37,583 --> 00:28:39,583
FELIPE HAD HER LOCKED IN THE
BASEMENT.

395
00:28:39,585 --> 00:28:42,086
WHAT?!
WHAT?!

396
00:28:42,088 --> 00:28:43,754
OH, MY GOD.

397
00:28:43,756 --> 00:28:44,388
WHAT HAPPENED?

398
00:28:44,390 --> 00:28:46,056
HE HAD A GUN POINTED AT JILL.

399
00:28:46,759 --> 00:28:49,259
WE SHOULD TIE HIM UP IN THE
OTHER ROOM.

400
00:28:49,261 --> 00:28:51,829
GIVE ME A HAND.

401
00:28:55,333 --> 00:28:57,067
THIS IS UNBELIEVABLE.

402
00:29:03,675 --> 00:29:04,341
GINA.

403
00:29:04,343 --> 00:29:05,275
I'M GONNA CHECK THE BOX,
OKAY?

404
00:29:05,277 --> 00:29:07,010
LOOK, GINA, WE DON'T KNOW
WHAT ELSE IS DOWN THERE.

405
00:29:07,012 --> 00:29:08,045
WE SHOULD STICK TOGETHER.

406
00:29:08,047 --> 00:29:09,480
I'LL BE FINE.

407
00:29:14,086 --> 00:29:15,919
CHECK TO SEE IF HE HAS A CAR.

408
00:29:15,921 --> 00:29:17,521
AUTOMOBILE. ENTIENDES?

409
00:29:17,523 --> 00:29:21,859
A CAR.

410
00:29:21,861 --> 00:29:23,260
JILL, DON'T GO FAR.

411
00:29:23,262 --> 00:29:24,128
I MAY NEED YOU.

412
00:29:24,130 --> 00:29:26,430
I WANT TO ASK HIM SOME QUESTIONS

413
00:29:26,432 --> 00:29:30,033
WHEN HE WAKES UP.

414
00:29:30,035 --> 00:29:31,735
I'M SO SORRY THAT THIS HAS

415
00:29:31,737 --> 00:29:32,436
HAPPENED TO YOU.

416
00:29:32,438 --> 00:29:34,338
BUT WE WILL TAKE CARE OF YOU AND

417
00:29:34,340 --> 00:29:38,075
GET YOU HELP.

418
00:29:38,077 --> 00:29:39,276
IT'S OKAY.

419
00:29:39,278 --> 00:29:42,079
IT'S OKAY.

420
00:29:42,081 --> 00:29:45,182
WHERE IS YOUR MAMA?

421
00:29:45,184 --> 00:29:46,049
FELIPE.

422
00:29:46,051 --> 00:29:47,084
DON'T WORRY.

423
00:29:47,086 --> 00:29:48,819
I WON'T LET HIM NEAR YOU.

424
00:29:48,821 --> 00:29:50,988
WE CAN'T LEAVE YET, BUT WE'LL

425
00:29:50,990 --> 00:29:53,457
FIND A WAY OUT OF HERE.

426
00:29:53,459 --> 00:29:55,225
YOU HUNGRY?

427
00:29:55,227 --> 00:29:57,194
OKAY. GINA!

428
00:29:57,196 --> 00:29:59,863
JILL?

429
00:29:59,865 --> 00:30:01,765
STAY THERE.

430
00:30:01,767 --> 00:30:03,634
GINA?

431
00:30:03,636 --> 00:30:08,105
JILL!

432
00:31:47,939 --> 00:31:50,240
ANA MARIA.

433
00:31:54,213 --> 00:31:57,648
I TOLD YOU I DON'T SPEAK
SPANISH. JILL!

434
00:32:00,019 --> 00:32:01,418
I DON'T SPEAK SPANISH!

435
00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:03,253
WHAT'D YOU DO TO THE LITTLE
GIRL?

436
00:32:13,097 --> 00:32:15,565
JILL!

437
00:32:22,341 --> 00:32:24,408
JILL, I NEED YOU NOW!

438
00:32:26,445 --> 00:32:27,978
WHAT'S HE SAYING?

439
00:32:27,980 --> 00:32:31,148
HE SAID WE'RE ALL GONNA DIE.

440
00:32:38,057 --> 00:32:40,524
ANA MARIA?

441
00:33:45,924 --> 00:33:48,225
ANA MARIA?

442
00:34:38,643 --> 00:34:40,944
ANA MARIA!

443
00:35:30,896 --> 00:35:31,761
OPEN THE DOOR.

444
00:35:32,898 --> 00:35:34,898
ANA MARIA, I NEED YOU TO OPEN

445
00:35:34,900 --> 00:35:35,365
THE DOOR.

446
00:35:38,437 --> 00:35:39,436
ANA MARIA!

447
00:36:52,511 --> 00:36:55,345
ADIOS, PAPA.

448
00:37:18,102 --> 00:37:19,970
VAMOS.

449
00:37:19,972 --> 00:37:22,205
VAMOS!

450
00:38:03,214 --> 00:38:05,882
ANA MARIA!

451
00:38:15,026 --> 00:38:16,393
HAS ANYONE SEEN ANA MARIA?

452
00:38:16,395 --> 00:38:18,261
>> I THOUGHT SHE WAS WITH YOU.

453
00:38:18,263 --> 00:38:21,031
YOU OKAY?

454
00:38:21,033 --> 00:38:22,065
RAMON IS GETTING FELIPE'S CAR.

455
00:38:22,067 --> 00:38:23,800
WE'RE GETTING THE HELL OUT OF

456
00:38:23,802 --> 00:38:27,370
HERE.

457
00:38:27,372 --> 00:38:29,005
WHY'D YOU TAKE HER OUTSIDE?

458
00:38:29,007 --> 00:38:30,507
SHE WAS THERE ALONE.

459
00:38:30,509 --> 00:38:33,176
I DON'T KNOW WHY.

460
00:38:40,551 --> 00:38:41,718
GINA, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

461
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:43,053
TRYING TO FIND OUT WHAT THE

462
00:38:43,055 --> 00:38:44,120
HELL HAPPENED DOWN THERE.

463
00:38:44,122 --> 00:38:45,088
WHAT MATTERS IS THAT WE GET

464
00:38:45,090 --> 00:38:47,324
LAUREN AND ANA MARIA TO THE
DOCTOR, OKAY?

465
00:38:47,326 --> 00:38:48,091
PUT THAT AWAY.

466
00:38:50,595 --> 00:38:53,163
THE OLD MAN'S CAR IS DESTROYED.

467
00:38:53,165 --> 00:38:53,663
CAN IT BE FIXED?

468
00:38:53,665 --> 00:38:55,098
>> FELIPE HAS TO HAVE SOME KIND

469
00:38:55,100 --> 00:38:55,632
OF TRANSPORTATION.

470
00:38:55,634 --> 00:38:56,900
I MEAN, HE CAN'T SURVIVE IN THE

471
00:38:56,902 --> 00:38:58,201
MIDDLE OF NOWHERE WITHOUT ONE.

472
00:38:58,203 --> 00:38:59,436
I'LL GET HIM TALKING.

473
00:39:02,541 --> 00:39:05,208
DID YOU HEAR THAT?

474
00:39:05,210 --> 00:39:06,576
YEAH.

475
00:39:16,754 --> 00:39:19,456
WHAT WAS THAT?

476
00:39:34,538 --> 00:39:35,405
I-I-I...

477
00:39:35,407 --> 00:39:36,473
IT'S OKAY.

478
00:39:36,475 --> 00:39:37,774
IT'S OKAY.

479
00:39:40,412 --> 00:39:42,979
DAVID, LOOK AT THIS WRIST.

480
00:39:52,623 --> 00:39:54,324
HE SLASHED HIS WRIST BEFORE

481
00:39:54,326 --> 00:39:56,559
HE ATTACKED US.

482
00:39:56,561 --> 00:39:57,861
DAD?

483
00:39:57,863 --> 00:40:00,363
DAD, WHAT'S GOING ON?

484
00:41:21,446 --> 00:41:22,846
HEY.

485
00:41:22,848 --> 00:41:26,282
EVERYTHING'S GONNA BE OKAY.

486
00:41:26,284 --> 00:41:27,650
LOOK, WE NEED TO GET

487
00:41:27,652 --> 00:41:28,918
ANA MARIA TO A DOCTOR.

488
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:30,720
I HAVE NO IDEA HOW BAD THOSE

489
00:41:30,722 --> 00:41:32,222
INJURIES MIGHT BE, AND...

490
00:41:32,224 --> 00:41:33,957
SO WHEN -- WHEN THE STORM LETS

491
00:41:33,959 --> 00:41:36,059
UP, LEAVE US HERE AND YOU AND

492
00:41:36,061 --> 00:41:38,394
RAMON NEED TO HIKE INTO TOWN.

493
00:41:38,396 --> 00:41:39,863
WHAT ABOUT YOU?

494
00:41:39,865 --> 00:41:41,931
I'LL BE FINE.

495
00:41:41,933 --> 00:41:43,900
LOOK, IF MY DAD HAS TO PUSH ME

496
00:41:43,902 --> 00:41:46,002
IN A WHEELCHAIR DOWN THE AISLE,

497
00:41:46,004 --> 00:41:48,271
WE ARE STILL GETTING MARRIED.

498
00:42:02,620 --> 00:42:06,689
UH...

499
00:42:18,636 --> 00:42:20,603
OKAY.

500
00:42:20,605 --> 00:42:24,707
ALL RIGHT.

501
00:42:24,709 --> 00:42:25,475
DAD.

502
00:42:25,477 --> 00:42:26,276
YEAH?

503
00:42:26,278 --> 00:42:28,611
I NEED YOU.

504
00:42:38,556 --> 00:42:40,189
DAD, THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG

505
00:42:40,191 --> 00:42:40,823
WITH THIS PLACE.

506
00:42:40,825 --> 00:42:42,592
WHY ARE ALL THE PHONE LINES CUT?

507
00:42:42,594 --> 00:42:43,793
WHAT WAS HE TRYING TO HIDE?

508
00:42:43,795 --> 00:42:45,094
WHAT'S HE TRYING TO HIDE?

509
00:42:45,096 --> 00:42:46,696
THAT HE'S A PEDOPHILE, JILL.

510
00:42:46,698 --> 00:42:47,697
I DON'T THINK THAT'S IT.

511
00:42:47,699 --> 00:42:49,098
LOOK, THAT BOX LOOKED LIKE IT

512
00:42:49,100 --> 00:42:52,101
HADN'T BEEN OPENED IN A LONG,
LONG TIME.

513
00:42:52,103 --> 00:42:54,137
HOW'D SHE STAY ALIVE IN THERE?

514
00:42:54,139 --> 00:42:56,606
WELL, I GUESS HE SHOVED FOOD

515
00:42:56,608 --> 00:42:57,440
UNDER IT.

516
00:42:57,442 --> 00:42:58,041
WHERE?

517
00:42:58,043 --> 00:43:00,510
IT WAS SEALED SHUT.

518
00:43:03,647 --> 00:43:04,013
OKAY.

519
00:43:04,015 --> 00:43:05,982
LET'S TAKE ANOTHER LOOK AT THAT

520
00:43:05,984 --> 00:43:08,051
BOX.

521
00:43:20,364 --> 00:43:20,797
GINA.

522
00:43:20,799 --> 00:43:21,831
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

523
00:43:21,833 --> 00:43:23,733
I NEED HER SIDE OF THE STORY.

524
00:43:23,735 --> 00:43:25,301
OKAY, THIS IS AMAZING, LAUREN.

525
00:43:25,303 --> 00:43:25,735
THIS IS CRAZY.

526
00:43:25,737 --> 00:43:27,303
THIS MIGHT BE ALSO HEALING FOR

527
00:43:27,305 --> 00:43:27,904
HER, YOU KNOW?

528
00:43:30,308 --> 00:43:32,308
SHE DOESN'T WANT TO TALK, SO
STOP FILMING HER.

529
00:43:32,310 --> 00:43:33,810
AND DON'T BULLSHIT ME THAT THIS

530
00:43:33,812 --> 00:43:36,312
MIGHT BE THERAPEUTIC.

531
00:43:42,586 --> 00:43:44,253
I'M GONNA BRING YOU SOME MORE

532
00:43:44,255 --> 00:43:47,657
ICE, OKAY?

533
00:43:47,659 --> 00:43:49,092
THANK YOU.

534
00:43:49,094 --> 00:43:51,327
SURE.

535
00:45:40,705 --> 00:45:42,238
AAH!

536
00:45:51,882 --> 00:45:54,283
AAAH!

537
00:46:24,114 --> 00:46:25,581
SEEN THIS SYMBOL.

538
00:46:25,583 --> 00:46:28,151
IT'S IN FELIPE'S JOURNAL.

539
00:46:28,153 --> 00:46:30,353
WHAT DOES IT MEAN?

540
00:46:30,355 --> 00:46:32,588
I DON'T KNOW.

541
00:46:32,590 --> 00:46:34,423
IT LOOKS LIKE SOME KIND OF

542
00:46:34,425 --> 00:46:36,859
LANGUAGE.

543
00:46:36,861 --> 00:46:38,361
ANA MARIA COULDN'T HAVE

544
00:46:38,363 --> 00:46:39,162
WRITTEN THAT.

545
00:46:39,164 --> 00:46:40,596
IT'S TOO HIGH.

546
00:46:47,037 --> 00:46:52,041
THAT POOR GIRL.

547
00:46:54,612 --> 00:46:57,113
LET'S GET OUT OF HERE.

548
00:47:02,820 --> 00:47:03,886
WHO IS THAT?

549
00:47:03,888 --> 00:47:05,955
WHOEVER IT IS, THEY'VE BEEN

550
00:47:05,957 --> 00:47:08,457
DEAD FOR A LONG TIME.

551
00:47:42,026 --> 00:47:45,361
SOME WRITING ON IT.

552
00:47:45,363 --> 00:47:47,396
IT'S IN SPANISH.

553
00:47:47,398 --> 00:47:51,300
HERE.

554
00:47:57,808 --> 00:47:59,208
THAT WAS HIS WIFE.

555
00:47:59,210 --> 00:48:01,944
IT SAYS SHE WAS THE LOVE OF HIS

556
00:48:01,946 --> 00:48:03,212
LIFE.

557
00:48:03,214 --> 00:48:06,782
THEN WHY DID HE KILL HER?

558
00:48:32,276 --> 00:48:35,444
WE THINK HE'S LIVING DOWN HERE.

559
00:48:56,733 --> 00:48:59,101
LOOK AT THIS.

560
00:49:02,739 --> 00:49:04,907
IS THAT ANA MARIA?

561
00:49:04,909 --> 00:49:08,644
LOOKS LIKE HER.

562
00:49:08,646 --> 00:49:10,746
1978.

563
00:49:10,748 --> 00:49:12,181
DAD, THAT'S NOT POSSIBLE.

564
00:49:12,183 --> 00:49:14,717
SHE'D BE ALMOST 40 YEARS OLD
NOW.

565
00:49:14,719 --> 00:49:17,119
WE NEED TO TALK TO ANA MARIA.

566
00:49:17,121 --> 00:49:18,087
DAVID!

567
00:49:18,089 --> 00:49:20,222
JESUS.

568
00:49:20,224 --> 00:49:22,291
WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED?
GINA.

569
00:49:22,293 --> 00:49:23,893
HUH?! IS SHE OKAY?!

570
00:49:23,895 --> 00:49:25,027
I JUST FOUND THEM LIKE THIS.

571
00:49:25,029 --> 00:49:26,529
GINA WAS ON THE FLOOR, AND

572
00:49:26,531 --> 00:49:28,331
ANA MARIA WAS DEAD.

573
00:49:28,333 --> 00:49:30,433
ANA MARIA, LISTEN TO ME.
ANA MARIA.

574
00:49:30,435 --> 00:49:32,134
>> SOMEBODY SLASHED HER THROAT.

575
00:49:32,136 --> 00:49:33,636
WHAT -- WHAT HAPPENED?

576
00:49:33,638 --> 00:49:34,203
GINA.

577
00:49:35,173 --> 00:49:36,472
>> COME ON. WAKE UP.

578
00:49:36,474 --> 00:49:38,174
HUH? WHAT HAPPENED?!

579
00:49:38,176 --> 00:49:40,142
WHO DID THIS?!

580
00:49:50,754 --> 00:49:52,989
SOMEONE'S HERE IN THE HOUSE.

581
00:49:52,991 --> 00:49:54,457
YOU SAW SOMEONE?

582
00:49:54,459 --> 00:49:55,591
NO, BUT I FELT, LIKE, AN

583
00:49:55,593 --> 00:49:57,126
ELECTRIC SHOCK, LIKE A TASER,

584
00:49:57,128 --> 00:49:59,762
AND -- AND I CAN'T REMEMBER
ANYTHING ELSE.

585
00:49:59,764 --> 00:50:01,063
THEN YOU GUYS FOUND ME.
THAT'S ALL.

586
00:50:01,065 --> 00:50:03,366
ALL RIGHT.
FROM NOW ON, WE STAY TOGETHER.

587
00:50:03,368 --> 00:50:05,201
STORM WILL LET UP IN THE
MORNING.

588
00:50:05,203 --> 00:50:05,735
WE'LL LEAVE THEN.

589
00:50:05,737 --> 00:50:07,403
NO. WE NEED TO GET OUT
OF HERE RIGHT NOW.

590
00:50:07,405 --> 00:50:08,971
WE STAY HERE, AND WE STAY
TOGETHER.

591
00:50:08,973 --> 00:50:11,240
I NEED TO GET OUT OF HERE
RIGHT NOW.

592
00:50:11,242 --> 00:50:12,208
FOR ALL WE KNOW, FELIPE COULD BE

593
00:50:12,210 --> 00:50:13,075
HIDING AN ACCOMPLICE SOMEWHERE.

594
00:50:13,077 --> 00:50:15,011
GINA'S RIGHT, DAVID.
LOOK, IF THERE'S SOMEONE ELSE
HERE --

595
00:50:15,013 --> 00:50:17,279
NO, IT'S BETTER TO STAY IN
THE HOUSE THAN WANDER AROUND IN

596
00:50:17,281 --> 00:50:18,080
THE STORM OUTSIDE.

597
00:50:18,082 --> 00:50:18,948
IT'S GONNA GET DARK SOON.

598
00:50:18,950 --> 00:50:20,549
GUYS, I DON'T KNOW.

599
00:50:20,551 --> 00:50:21,517
ALL I KNOW IS THAT LITTLE GIRL

600
00:50:21,519 --> 00:50:22,885
SCARED THE SHIT OUT OF ME, OKAY?

601
00:50:22,887 --> 00:50:24,286
I'M GLAD SHE'S DEAD.

602
00:50:24,521 --> 00:50:27,890
HOW CAN YOU SAY THAT?
SHE WAS JUST AN ABUSED LITTLE
GIRL.

603
00:50:27,892 --> 00:50:29,191
YOU THINK SO?

604
00:50:29,193 --> 00:50:30,960
FELIPE DIDN'T SEEM ANGRY WHEN WE

605
00:50:30,962 --> 00:50:32,261
LET HER OUT OF THE BOX.

606
00:50:32,263 --> 00:50:33,295
HE SEEMED TERRIFIED.

607
00:50:33,297 --> 00:50:34,296
AND THEN HE TOLD ME THAT MY

608
00:50:34,298 --> 00:50:35,531
ROSARY WOULDN'T PROTECT ME?

609
00:50:35,533 --> 00:50:36,966
PROTECT ME FROM WHAT?

610
00:50:36,968 --> 00:50:37,867
AND WHAT ABOUT THOSE ANCIENT

611
00:50:37,869 --> 00:50:39,068
MARKINGS INSIDE THE BOX, HUH?

612
00:50:39,070 --> 00:50:40,302
WHAT DID THEY MEAN?

613
00:50:40,304 --> 00:50:41,470
THIS IS RIDICULOUS.

614
00:50:41,472 --> 00:50:43,639
DAD.

615
00:50:43,641 --> 00:50:44,874
DAD, COME ON.

616
00:50:44,876 --> 00:50:46,108
YOU SAW THAT PHOTO.

617
00:50:46,110 --> 00:50:48,477
DOESN'T TAKE A BOX LIKE THAT TO

618
00:50:48,479 --> 00:50:51,147
LOCK UP AN ORDINARY LITTLE GIRL.

619
00:50:51,149 --> 00:50:52,782
ISN'T THAT RIGHT?

620
00:50:52,784 --> 00:50:54,517
WHAT PHOTO?

621
00:51:04,027 --> 00:51:05,094
WHAT IS THIS?

622
00:51:05,096 --> 00:51:09,865
LOOK AT THE DATE.

623
00:51:09,867 --> 00:51:12,034
THAT CAN'T BE HER.
LOOKS JUST LIKE HER.

624
00:51:12,036 --> 00:51:14,870
THIS IS IMPOSSIBLE.

625
00:51:14,872 --> 00:51:17,907
YOU'VE ALL LOST YOUR MINDS.

626
00:51:17,909 --> 00:51:20,176
I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON
HERE, BUT ALL THIS SHIT STARTED

627
00:51:20,178 --> 00:51:21,544
HAPPENING WHEN WE LET ANA MARIA

628
00:51:21,546 --> 00:51:23,446
OUT OF THE BOX.

629
00:51:23,448 --> 00:51:24,513
ALL I CARE ABOUT NOW IS GETTING

630
00:51:24,515 --> 00:51:25,648
THE FIVE OF US OUT OF HERE

631
00:51:25,650 --> 00:51:27,083
SAFELY, SO WE LEAVE IN THE

632
00:51:27,085 --> 00:51:28,451
MORNING.

633
00:51:28,453 --> 00:51:29,585
HERE.

634
00:51:29,587 --> 00:51:31,120
KEEP AN EYE ON THEM.

635
00:51:31,122 --> 00:51:32,888
MAKE SURE NOTHING ELSE HAPPENS.

636
00:51:32,890 --> 00:51:34,356
I'M GONNA GO TAKE CARE OF

637
00:51:34,358 --> 00:51:36,759
ANA MARIA'S BODY.

638
00:52:00,617 --> 00:52:03,119
WHO DID THIS TO YOU?

639
00:53:02,612 --> 00:53:04,813
YOU OKAY?

640
00:53:04,815 --> 00:53:05,648
YEAH.

641
00:53:05,650 --> 00:53:07,983
YEAH, I'M OKAY.

642
00:53:07,985 --> 00:53:09,218
OKAY, NO, YOU KNOW WHAT?

643
00:53:09,220 --> 00:53:10,920
I WON'T STAY HERE DOING NOTHING.

644
00:53:10,922 --> 00:53:14,490
GIVE ME YOUR CELLPHONE.

645
00:53:14,492 --> 00:53:17,459
THERE'S NO SIGNAL.
I'LL FIND IT.

646
00:53:17,461 --> 00:53:18,060
HEY. WHERE YOU GOING?

647
00:53:18,062 --> 00:53:21,197
I'M GETTING US OUT OF HERE.
NO, WAIT. GINA. GINA!

648
00:53:21,199 --> 00:53:24,033
YOU GO WITH HER.

649
00:53:24,035 --> 00:53:24,833
HEY.

650
00:53:24,835 --> 00:53:26,101
YOU STAY WITH ME IN CASE THERE'S

651
00:53:26,103 --> 00:53:28,237
SOMEONE IN THE HOUSE, OKAY?

652
00:53:30,942 --> 00:53:32,541
WHAT? WHAT'S WRONG?

653
00:53:32,543 --> 00:53:35,177
DAD.
DAD, I SAW SOMEONE OUTSIDE.

654
00:53:35,179 --> 00:53:37,479
STAY HERE.

655
00:53:54,599 --> 00:53:57,499
THANK GOD IT'S YOU.
YOU PULLED US OVER ON THE ROAD,

656
00:53:57,501 --> 00:53:59,301
REMEMBER?


657
00:53:59,303 --> 00:54:00,336
WHAT?


658
00:54:00,338 --> 00:54:01,937
OKAY, LISTEN, WE GOT INTO AN

659
00:54:01,939 --> 00:54:03,038
ACCIDENT IN OUR CAR.

660
00:54:03,040 --> 00:54:04,073
OUR CAR.

661
00:54:04,075 --> 00:54:05,407
WE HAD TO WALK HERE. WHAT?

662
00:54:07,144 --> 00:54:08,077
FELIPE IS, UH...

663
00:54:08,079 --> 00:54:08,677
VAMOS!

664
00:54:08,679 --> 00:54:09,345
MY DAUGHTER!

665
00:54:09,347 --> 00:54:10,079
SHE SPEAKS SPANISH!

666
00:54:10,081 --> 00:54:11,880
VAMOS!
>> SHE CAN EXPLAIN, OKAY?

667
00:54:11,882 --> 00:54:14,950
>> GO!
>> OKAY, WAIT, WAIT.

668
00:54:17,554 --> 00:54:19,154
FELIPE!

669
00:54:21,592 --> 00:54:24,927
JILL!

670
00:54:24,929 --> 00:54:26,428
OH, MY GOD.

671
00:54:28,699 --> 00:54:30,065
COME HERE, COME HERE.

672
00:54:30,067 --> 00:54:31,567
JUST EXPLAIN TO HIM WHAT

673
00:54:31,569 --> 00:54:33,535
HAPPENED, OKAY?

674
00:54:38,742 --> 00:54:41,043
HE WANTS TO KNOW WHERE FELIPE
IS.

675
00:54:42,546 --> 00:54:43,245
OKAY! WAIT!

676
00:54:43,247 --> 00:54:44,280
I'LL SHOW YOU.

677
00:54:44,282 --> 00:54:45,781
VAMOS. VAMOS!

678
00:54:45,783 --> 00:54:49,051
GO!

679
00:54:51,355 --> 00:54:53,789
RáPIDO!

680
00:54:57,794 --> 00:54:59,461
HE HAD A LITTLE GIRL IN A
BOX.

681
00:54:59,463 --> 00:55:02,064
HE TRIED TO ATTACK US.

682
00:55:02,066 --> 00:55:04,400
JUST TELL HIM WHAT HAPPENED!

683
00:55:11,175 --> 00:55:12,441
WHY YOU LET HER OUT?!

684
00:55:12,443 --> 00:55:14,043
AAH!
THAT WASN'T US!

685
00:55:15,313 --> 00:55:16,845
TO THE BASEMENT RIGHT NOW!

686
00:55:16,847 --> 00:55:18,714
RIGHT NOW! GO! I SHOOT!

687
00:55:18,716 --> 00:55:21,216
GO!

688
00:55:21,218 --> 00:55:22,117
VAMOS!

689
00:55:22,119 --> 00:55:24,386
RáPIDO!

690
00:55:28,993 --> 00:55:33,562
OPEN THE DOOR!

691
00:55:33,564 --> 00:55:35,531
OKAY, GET IN. GET IN.

692
00:55:35,533 --> 00:55:36,598
GET IN, I SAY!

693
00:55:36,600 --> 00:55:37,533
DON'T TOUCH HER!

694
00:55:37,535 --> 00:55:38,634
STOP RIGHT THERE.

695
00:55:41,639 --> 00:55:42,237
LET'S GO.

696
00:55:42,239 --> 00:55:43,839
DO WHAT HE SAYS.

697
00:55:43,841 --> 00:55:44,673
VAMOS.

698
00:55:44,675 --> 00:55:45,708
JESUS.

699
00:55:45,710 --> 00:55:46,675
QUICKLY.

700
00:55:46,677 --> 00:55:48,677
OKAY.

701
00:55:48,679 --> 00:55:50,913
GO!

702
00:56:03,361 --> 00:56:05,894
WHERE IS THE OTHER WOMAN?
GINA?

703
00:56:07,164 --> 00:56:07,963
SHE LOOKED FOR HELP!

704
00:56:07,965 --> 00:56:09,498
GO IN.
NO.
GO IN.

705
00:56:09,500 --> 00:56:10,332
NO. DON'T GO ANYWHERE.

706
00:56:10,334 --> 00:56:10,966
LISTEN TO ME.

707
00:56:10,968 --> 00:56:13,102
YOU HAVE TO LISTEN TO US.

708
00:56:13,104 --> 00:56:14,636
WHY ARE YOU SO SCARED?

709
00:56:14,638 --> 00:56:15,270
IT'S JUST US.

710
00:56:15,272 --> 00:56:16,438
GO. GO IN! GO IN!

711
00:56:16,440 --> 00:56:18,273
GO IN!
DAVID!
DAD!

712
00:56:35,959 --> 00:56:38,160
AAH!

713
00:56:40,897 --> 00:56:43,599
LET HIM GO.

714
00:56:55,245 --> 00:56:56,812
IS THERE ANYONE ELSE WITH

715
00:56:56,814 --> 00:56:58,180
YOU?

716
00:57:01,252 --> 00:57:01,850
ANSWER HER.

717
00:57:01,852 --> 00:57:03,252
AFTER YOU GO IN THE BOX, I

718
00:57:03,254 --> 00:57:05,554
WILL ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU
HAVE.

719
00:57:05,556 --> 00:57:09,691
LIKE HELL WE'RE GOING IN
THERE.

720
00:57:09,693 --> 00:57:11,527
JILL, TAKE LAUREN UPSTAIRS.

721
00:57:11,529 --> 00:57:12,327
FIND GINA AND RAMON.

722
00:57:12,329 --> 00:57:13,529
WE'RE TAKING HIS TRUCK AND

723
00:57:13,531 --> 00:57:14,096
GETTING OUT OF HERE.

724
00:57:14,098 --> 00:57:15,697
COME ON. LET'S GO.
GET IN THE BOX.

725
00:57:15,699 --> 00:57:18,801
COME ON. NOW. IN THE BOX.

726
00:57:45,295 --> 00:57:48,464
GET IN.

727
00:57:48,466 --> 00:57:50,966
LISTEN, YOU WENT IN THE BOX.

728
00:57:50,968 --> 00:57:52,000
I TRUST YOU.

729
00:57:52,002 --> 00:57:54,036
YOUR FAMILY IS IN DANGER.

730
00:57:54,038 --> 00:57:54,670
WHY?

731
00:57:54,672 --> 00:57:55,904
SHE'S OUT.

732
00:57:55,906 --> 00:57:56,405
WHO?

733
00:57:56,407 --> 00:57:58,941
FELIPE'S DAUGHTER?

734
00:57:58,943 --> 00:57:59,708
SHE'S DEAD.

735
00:57:59,710 --> 00:58:00,642
SHE IS NOT DEAD.

736
00:58:00,644 --> 00:58:02,377
SHE'S NOT EVEN A LITTLE GIRL.

737
00:58:02,379 --> 00:58:04,146
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

738
00:58:04,148 --> 00:58:06,248
WHO WAS WITH ANA MARIA WHEN

739
00:58:06,250 --> 00:58:06,849
SHE DIED?

740
00:58:06,851 --> 00:58:08,116
GINA AND LAUREN.

741
00:58:08,118 --> 00:58:09,251
WHERE ARE THEY NOW?

742
00:58:09,253 --> 00:58:10,686
WHAT DOES THAT MATTER?

743
00:58:10,688 --> 00:58:12,488
BECAUSE ONE OF THEM IS NOT

744
00:58:12,490 --> 00:58:13,722
YOUR FAMILY ANYMORE.

745
00:58:27,537 --> 00:58:30,506
HOW IS THAT SIMPLE?

746
00:58:44,487 --> 00:58:46,788
WE DON'T HAVE MUCH TIME.

747
00:58:46,790 --> 00:58:47,456
PLEASE.

748
00:58:47,458 --> 00:58:48,891
LET ME SHOW YOU.

749
00:59:27,697 --> 00:59:30,866
DAD, I CAN'T FIND THEM
ANYWHERE.

750
00:59:30,868 --> 00:59:34,403
WHAT IS HE DOING HERE?

751
00:59:34,405 --> 00:59:35,971
THE HAND.

752
00:59:35,973 --> 00:59:37,873
IT'S OKAY.

753
00:59:40,711 --> 00:59:44,379
IT'S THE OTHER WOMAN.

754
01:00:13,143 --> 01:00:15,844
MMM.

755
01:00:42,539 --> 01:00:44,339
DAVID, YOU HAVE TO TRUST ME

756
01:00:44,341 --> 01:00:48,810
IF YOU WANT YOUR FAMILY TO
SURVIVE.

757
01:01:03,661 --> 01:01:06,561
GINA.

758
01:01:06,563 --> 01:01:08,664
GINA.

759
01:01:36,592 --> 01:01:38,460
HER NAME WAS ELENA.

760
01:01:38,462 --> 01:01:39,928
SHE WAS A BRUJA.

761
01:01:39,930 --> 01:01:40,962
A WHAT?

762
01:01:40,964 --> 01:01:42,097
A WITCH.

763
01:01:42,099 --> 01:01:43,665
THE SPANISH PRIESTS, THEY HUNG

764
01:01:43,667 --> 01:01:45,767
HER HERE IN GALLOWS HILL IN THE

765
01:01:45,769 --> 01:01:46,401
17th CENTURY.

766
01:01:46,403 --> 01:01:48,103
30 YEARS AGO, FELIPE FOUND AN

767
01:01:48,105 --> 01:01:50,005
OLD MAN SEALED AWAY WITH THOSE

768
01:01:50,007 --> 01:01:50,972
ANCIENT SYMBOLS.

769
01:01:50,974 --> 01:01:51,673
HE LET HIM OUT.

770
01:01:51,675 --> 01:01:53,575
YOU SAID ELENA WAS THE WITCH.

771
01:01:53,577 --> 01:01:54,843
SHE CANNOT BE KILLED.

772
01:01:54,845 --> 01:01:56,611
IF YOU KILL HER, SHE WILL GO

773
01:01:56,613 --> 01:01:57,245
INSIDE OF YOU.

774
01:01:57,247 --> 01:01:58,980
WHEN SHE WENT INTO HIS DAUGHTER,

775
01:01:58,982 --> 01:02:01,283
FELIPE BUILT THAT BOX TO HOLD
HER.

776
01:02:04,087 --> 01:02:06,054
FELIPE WROTE DOWN EVERYTHING HE

777
01:02:06,056 --> 01:02:07,689
FOUND OUT IN THAT DIARY.

778
01:02:07,691 --> 01:02:09,958
WHATEVER YOU DO, DO NOT LISTEN

779
01:02:09,960 --> 01:02:10,292
TO HER.

780
01:02:10,294 --> 01:02:12,160
SHE KNOWS ALL YOUR SECRETS.

781
01:02:12,162 --> 01:02:14,830
SHE WILL USE THEM AGAINST YOU.

782
01:02:29,713 --> 01:02:31,546
WE ARE TOO LATE.

783
01:02:31,548 --> 01:02:33,348
THE BOY MUST HAVE SHOT HER.

784
01:02:33,350 --> 01:02:34,316
SHE'S INSIDE HIM NOW.

785
01:02:34,318 --> 01:02:35,851
YOU SAYING RAMON KILLED GINA?

786
01:02:35,853 --> 01:02:38,453
KEEP HIM AWAY FROM YOUR
FAMILY.

787
01:02:38,455 --> 01:02:41,056
SHE'LL DO ANYTHING TO LEAVE.

788
01:02:57,206 --> 01:02:58,140
OH, MY GOD.

789
01:02:58,142 --> 01:03:01,009
THESE ALL HAPPENED RIGHT
BEFORE THE INN CLOSED DOWN IN
'78.

790
01:03:01,011 --> 01:03:02,444
WHAT DOES -- WHAT DOES THIS

791
01:03:02,446 --> 01:03:03,211
MEAN?

792
01:03:03,213 --> 01:03:04,746
AUTO-DA-Fé.

793
01:03:04,748 --> 01:03:06,414
IT SAYS HERE IT'S THE BURNING

794
01:03:06,416 --> 01:03:06,982
OF THE HERETIC.

795
01:03:06,984 --> 01:03:08,350
THE SPANISH INQUISITION KILLED

796
01:03:08,352 --> 01:03:09,785
THOUSANDS OF INNOCENTS THAT WAY.

797
01:03:09,787 --> 01:03:11,586
APPARENTLY THIS ONE WASN'T SO

798
01:03:11,588 --> 01:03:13,722
INNOCENT.

799
01:03:13,724 --> 01:03:14,589
>> AAH!

800
01:03:20,697 --> 01:03:22,430
AAAAH!

801
01:03:48,792 --> 01:03:50,058
A WITCH? REALLY, DAVID?

802
01:03:50,060 --> 01:03:51,560
LOOK AT ALL THIS RESEARCH

803
01:03:51,562 --> 01:03:52,093
FELIPE HAS DONE.

804
01:03:52,095 --> 01:03:53,528
WHAT ARE ALL THOSE NAMES?

805
01:03:53,530 --> 01:03:55,163
THESE ARE THE SAME NAMES THAT

806
01:03:55,165 --> 01:03:56,698
ARE ON THE NEWSPAPERS.

807
01:03:56,700 --> 01:03:57,165
LOOK.

808
01:03:57,167 --> 01:04:00,402
HERNANDEZ, PEREZ...

809
01:04:00,404 --> 01:04:02,003
MORALES.

810
01:04:02,005 --> 01:04:02,871
MORALES?

811
01:04:02,873 --> 01:04:06,007
LIKE CAPTAIN MORALES.

812
01:04:06,009 --> 01:04:07,475
THESE ARE THE DESCENDANTS OF

813
01:04:07,477 --> 01:04:08,510
THOSE WHO WERE RESPONSIBLE FOR

814
01:04:08,512 --> 01:04:10,345
THE HANGING OF ELENA.

815
01:04:10,347 --> 01:04:11,813
THE WITCH.

816
01:04:13,250 --> 01:04:14,716
OPEN THE DOOR!

817
01:04:14,718 --> 01:04:17,219
RAMON IS COMING! HE'S WOUNDED!

818
01:04:17,221 --> 01:04:18,353
WHO ARE YOU?

819
01:04:18,355 --> 01:04:19,988
WHY IS YOUR NAME IN FELIPE'S

820
01:04:19,990 --> 01:04:21,356
JOURNAL?!

821
01:04:21,358 --> 01:04:22,791
MY ANCESTOR!

822
01:04:22,793 --> 01:04:26,027
HE WAS PRIEST THE HANGING OF THE
BRUJA!

823
01:04:26,029 --> 01:04:29,598
PLEASE OPEN THE DOOR!

824
01:04:29,600 --> 01:04:34,769
SHE KILLED MY FATHER, DAVID!

825
01:04:34,771 --> 01:04:38,406
COME ON! PLEASE!

826
01:04:38,408 --> 01:04:41,376
JILL, GO TO THE KITCHEN AND
GET ME SOME WET RAGS.

827
01:04:41,378 --> 01:04:42,777
YEAH.

828
01:04:42,779 --> 01:04:43,278
>> WHERE'S RAMON?

829
01:04:43,280 --> 01:04:45,747
I SHOT HIM IN THE LEG TO SLOW
HIM DOWN.

830
01:04:45,749 --> 01:04:47,515
HOW DO WE MAKE THIS STOP?

831
01:04:47,517 --> 01:04:50,986
SHE WILL NOT STOP UNTIL SHE
KILLS EVERY DESCENDANT.

832
01:04:50,988 --> 01:04:53,688
SHE DOES NOT CARE ABOUT YOU.

833
01:04:53,690 --> 01:04:55,957
YOU'RE JUST IN THE WAY.

834
01:04:55,959 --> 01:04:58,360
YOU STILL HAVE MY CAR KEYS?

835
01:04:58,362 --> 01:05:00,996
YOU TAKE YOUR FAMILY AWAY FROM
HERE.

836
01:05:00,998 --> 01:05:04,199
SHE DOES NOT WANT YOU. ONLY ME.
I AM SORRY.

837
01:05:04,201 --> 01:05:05,634
THIS IS ALL MY FAULT.

838
01:05:05,636 --> 01:05:07,202
I LET HER OUT OF THE BOX.

839
01:05:07,204 --> 01:05:07,602
NO, NO.

840
01:05:07,604 --> 01:05:09,871
I AM RESPONSIBLE FOR THE WITCH.

841
01:05:09,873 --> 01:05:12,240
YOU SAVE YOUR FAMILY.

842
01:05:28,891 --> 01:05:30,525
JILL!

843
01:05:30,527 --> 01:05:32,394
JILL, IT'S ME! OPEN UP!

844
01:05:32,396 --> 01:05:34,229
GINA?

845
01:05:34,231 --> 01:05:35,563
OH, MY GOD.

846
01:05:35,565 --> 01:05:36,631
GINA, YOU'RE ALIVE?

847
01:05:36,633 --> 01:05:37,999
WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?

848
01:05:38,001 --> 01:05:38,967
WHAT HAPPENED?

849
01:05:38,969 --> 01:05:40,101
>> OPEN THE DOOR.

850
01:05:40,103 --> 01:05:40,869
I WAS HIDING.

851
01:05:40,871 --> 01:05:43,071
RAMON TRIED TO KILL ME!

852
01:05:43,073 --> 01:05:45,640
 OPEN UP!

853
01:05:51,781 --> 01:05:54,015
GINA?

854
01:06:03,426 --> 01:06:04,192
AAH!

855
01:06:08,098 --> 01:06:08,596
AAH!

856
01:06:14,338 --> 01:06:17,839
NO!

857
01:06:17,841 --> 01:06:19,174
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
I HAD HIM.

858
01:06:19,176 --> 01:06:20,175
SAVING YOUR LIFE.

859
01:06:20,177 --> 01:06:22,310
YOU CAN'T KILL HIM.

860
01:06:22,312 --> 01:06:23,778
COME ON!

861
01:06:26,984 --> 01:06:30,218
REMEMBER, YOU SEE RAMON, IT'S

862
01:06:30,220 --> 01:06:31,386
NOT RAMON.

863
01:06:31,388 --> 01:06:33,221
IT'S THE BRUJA.

864
01:06:33,223 --> 01:06:35,423
YOU DO NOT KILL HER.

865
01:06:35,425 --> 01:06:36,691
YOU WOUND HER.

866
01:06:36,693 --> 01:06:38,393
YOU SLOW HER DOWN.

867
01:06:38,395 --> 01:06:40,228
YOU MUSTN'T KILL HER, FOR YOUR

868
01:06:40,230 --> 01:06:41,262
SAKE.

869
01:06:41,264 --> 01:06:46,201
IF YOU KILL HIM, YOU DIE.

870
01:06:46,203 --> 01:06:48,436
COME ON.

871
01:07:06,889 --> 01:07:09,224
GINA'S DEAD.

872
01:07:27,309 --> 01:07:29,544
FUCK!

873
01:07:36,953 --> 01:07:38,520
BITCH!

874
01:07:38,522 --> 01:07:41,056
FUCK YOU!

875
01:07:41,058 --> 01:07:43,491
JILL, COME ON.

876
01:07:43,493 --> 01:07:44,259
DAVID, NO!

877
01:07:44,261 --> 01:07:45,960
 DAVID!

878
01:07:45,962 --> 01:07:47,062
IT'S ME, RAMON!

879
01:07:47,064 --> 01:07:47,796
DAVID, IT'S ME!

880
01:07:47,798 --> 01:07:48,830
YOU GO GET MORALES.

881
01:07:48,832 --> 01:07:50,031
I'LL KEEP RAMON HERE.

882
01:07:50,600 --> 01:07:51,466
HE'S NOT GOING ANYWHERE.

883
01:07:51,468 --> 01:07:53,334
I JUST HANDCUFFED HIM TO THE
TRUCK.

884
01:07:53,336 --> 01:07:56,337
YOU GOT HIM. OH, MY --

885
01:08:00,911 --> 01:08:01,309
NO.

886
01:08:01,311 --> 01:08:03,578
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO!

887
01:08:03,580 --> 01:08:04,446
NO!

888
01:08:04,448 --> 01:08:06,514
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

889
01:08:06,516 --> 01:08:09,084
COME ON,
DAVID!

890
01:08:09,953 --> 01:08:11,853
COME ON!

891
01:08:13,223 --> 01:08:15,824
DAVID, SEE YOU SOON.

892
01:08:15,826 --> 01:08:17,492
WE'LL TALK ABOUT WHAT YOU DID TO

893
01:08:17,494 --> 01:08:19,227
MARCELA.

894
01:08:27,904 --> 01:08:29,838
GIVE ME THE KEYS.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

895
01:08:29,840 --> 01:08:30,872
GIVE ME THE HANDCUFF KEYS.

896
01:08:30,874 --> 01:08:32,006
GIVE ME THE KEYS!

897
01:08:32,008 --> 01:08:33,141
PLEASE!

898
01:08:33,375 --> 01:08:34,742
DAVID!

899
01:08:34,744 --> 01:08:37,278
WAIT.

900
01:09:00,569 --> 01:09:01,870
>> DAVID, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

901
01:09:01,872 --> 01:09:03,238
HE'LL TRY TO KILL US AGAIN.

902
01:09:03,240 --> 01:09:04,672
COME ON. COME ON.
BREATHE!

903
01:09:04,674 --> 01:09:06,341
WHY ARE YOU TRYING TO SAVE
HIM?

904
01:09:06,343 --> 01:09:06,808
THE WITCH!

905
01:09:06,810 --> 01:09:08,776
IF WE KILL HER, SHE SOMEHOW

906
01:09:08,778 --> 01:09:10,378
TAKES OVER YOUR BODY!

907
01:09:10,380 --> 01:09:12,614
WHAT?

908
01:09:19,356 --> 01:09:20,255
DAD!

909
01:09:20,257 --> 01:09:22,157
LAUREN!

910
01:09:22,159 --> 01:09:23,758
STAY WITH ME, BABY!

911
01:09:23,760 --> 01:09:24,826
STAY WITH ME! LOOK!

912
01:09:24,828 --> 01:09:26,594
YOU HAVE TO FIGHT IT! COME ON!

913
01:09:26,596 --> 01:09:28,196
YOU'RE STILL IN THERE.
YOU CAN FIGHT IT.

914
01:09:28,198 --> 01:09:29,264
STAY WITH ME.

915
01:09:29,266 --> 01:09:30,532
LOOK AT ME!

916
01:09:30,534 --> 01:09:32,167
LAUREN!

917
01:09:32,169 --> 01:09:33,968
COME ON! DON'T LEAVE ME!

918
01:09:35,939 --> 01:09:37,005

01:09:37,007 --> 01:09:38,206
GO GET SOME ROPE! QUICK!

920
01:09:40,443 --> 01:09:44,212
AAH!

921
01:09:44,214 --> 01:09:48,550
HURRY!

922
01:09:48,552 --> 01:09:50,118
PLEASE. PLEASE.

923
01:09:50,120 --> 01:09:50,885
HERE.

924
01:09:50,887 --> 01:09:51,920
GET HER FEET.

925
01:09:53,056 --> 01:09:54,656
 IT'S ALL YOUR
FAULT, DAVID.

926
01:09:54,658 --> 01:09:58,393
GOD IS PUNISHING YOU AND YOUR
FAMILY FOR WHAT YOU DID.

927
01:09:58,395 --> 01:09:59,394
OH, MY GOD.

928
01:09:59,396 --> 01:10:00,828
YOU KILLED HER, DAVID.

929
01:10:00,830 --> 01:10:02,764
DAD.

930
01:10:02,766 --> 01:10:03,431
SHUT UP!

931
01:10:03,433 --> 01:10:04,499
OH, HE TURNED OFF MOMMY'S

932
01:10:04,501 --> 01:10:06,201
MACHINE BECAUSE SHE WOULDN'T DIE

933
01:10:06,203 --> 01:10:07,702
FAST ENOUGH.

934
01:10:07,704 --> 01:10:09,103
DAD, WHAT IS SHE TALKING
ABOUT?

935
01:10:09,105 --> 01:10:10,638
SHUT UP!

936
01:10:10,640 --> 01:10:11,673
DAD, DID YOU DO THAT?

937
01:10:11,675 --> 01:10:13,041
HELP ME, JILL. PLEASE.

938
01:10:13,043 --> 01:10:15,310
IS THAT TRUE?

939
01:10:15,678 --> 01:10:17,445
I HATE YOU!

940
01:10:17,447 --> 01:10:18,446
JILL!

941
01:10:18,448 --> 01:10:18,913
WHAT?!

942
01:10:18,915 --> 01:10:20,815
WE NEED TO GET HER BACK TO
THE HOUSE.

943
01:10:20,817 --> 01:10:22,350
IT MIGHT BE THE ONLY WAY TO SAVE
HER.

944
01:10:22,352 --> 01:10:25,353
PLEASE. PLEASE.

945
01:10:26,556 --> 01:10:28,056
JILL!

946
01:10:41,605 --> 01:10:43,705
I NEED YOUR HELP.

947
01:10:43,707 --> 01:10:44,973
>> EL CAPITAN.

948
01:10:44,975 --> 01:10:46,107
DID YOU MISS ME?

949
01:10:46,109 --> 01:10:47,875
ELENA IS INSIDE OF HER NOW.

950
01:10:47,877 --> 01:10:49,410
WE MUST TAKE HER BACK DOWN TO

951
01:10:49,412 --> 01:10:49,978
THE BOX.

952
01:10:49,980 --> 01:10:51,646
FOR HOW LONG?
FOREVER.
NO.

953
01:10:51,648 --> 01:10:52,747
NO, THERE HAS TO BE ANOTHER WAY.

954
01:10:52,749 --> 01:10:54,616
DAVID, SHE'S NO LONGER LAUREN
ANYMORE.

955
01:10:54,618 --> 01:10:55,450
YOU CAN'T SAVE HER.

956
01:10:55,452 --> 01:10:56,818
 HE'S LYING.

957
01:10:56,820 --> 01:10:57,652
I CAN GET HER BACK.

958
01:10:57,654 --> 01:10:58,586
YOU GIVE ME ANOTHER BODY, AND

959
01:10:58,588 --> 01:10:59,721
I'LL GIVE YOU LAUREN.

960
01:10:59,723 --> 01:11:00,488
FELIPE WOULD HAVE SACRIFICED

961
01:11:00,490 --> 01:11:01,256
HIMSELF FOR ANA MARIA.

962
01:11:01,258 --> 01:11:02,423
ONCE THE WITCH HAS YOUR BODY,

963
01:11:02,425 --> 01:11:03,057
YOU ARE DEAD.

964
01:11:03,059 --> 01:11:04,525
THINK OF YOUR DAUGHTER.

965
01:11:07,497 --> 01:11:09,130
>> PLEASE, DAVID.

966
01:11:09,132 --> 01:11:12,800
WE MUST STOP HER NOW.

967
01:11:12,802 --> 01:11:14,068
COME ON.

968
01:11:16,206 --> 01:11:16,838
POOR LAUREN.

969
01:11:16,840 --> 01:11:18,306
UGLY AND ABUSED, LOCKED AWAY.

970
01:11:18,308 --> 01:11:22,076
YOU GONNA GIVE UP ON HER JUST
LIKE YOU DID MARCELA?

971
01:11:22,078 --> 01:11:24,345
>> AAH!

972
01:11:33,656 --> 01:11:36,024
D-D-DON'T SHOOT!

973
01:11:56,211 --> 01:11:58,012
I SHOULD HAVE SHOT HER.

974
01:11:58,014 --> 01:12:01,082
NO. YOU CAN'T KILL HER.

975
01:12:01,084 --> 01:12:02,684
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.

976
01:12:02,686 --> 01:12:05,553
I SHOOT HER, I DIE, SHE TAKE MY

977
01:12:05,555 --> 01:12:07,288
BODY.

978
01:12:07,290 --> 01:12:08,890
WITH NO BODY...

979
01:12:08,892 --> 01:12:10,558
WITHOUT -- WITHOUT A HOST,

980
01:12:10,560 --> 01:12:11,125
SHE'LL DIE?

981
01:12:11,127 --> 01:12:12,794
GO. BRING HER OUT.

982
01:12:12,796 --> 01:12:13,761
I KILL HER.

983
01:12:13,763 --> 01:12:16,164
YOU -- YOU AND YOUR DAUGHTER,

984
01:12:16,166 --> 01:12:18,733
YOU -- YOU'LL BE SAFE.

985
01:12:18,735 --> 01:12:21,669
GO QUICK.

986
01:12:21,671 --> 01:12:22,904
OKAY.

987
01:12:22,906 --> 01:12:23,838
HOLD.

988
01:12:23,840 --> 01:12:27,008
COME ON.

989
01:12:44,526 --> 01:12:46,661
YOU WANT ME?!

990
01:12:46,663 --> 01:12:49,097
I'M RIGHT HERE!

991
01:14:13,415 --> 01:14:14,382
GIVE

992
01:14:14,384 --> 01:14:17,118
YOURSELF TO ME AND I'LL LET JILL
LIVE.

993
01:14:17,120 --> 01:14:18,619
IF I KILL YOU, I GIVE

994
01:14:18,621 --> 01:14:20,888
YOU MY BODY, YOU PROMISE TO LET

995
01:14:20,890 --> 01:14:23,057
JILL LIVE?

996
01:14:23,059 --> 01:14:25,993
YES.

997
01:14:25,995 --> 01:14:29,730
I KNOW ALL YOUR SECRETS, DAVID.

998
01:14:29,732 --> 01:14:31,799
AAH!

999
01:14:43,045 --> 01:14:48,049
I'M NOT GONNA KILL YOU.

1000
01:14:48,051 --> 01:14:50,785
WE'LL SEE ABOUT THAT.

1001
01:14:50,787 --> 01:14:54,255
JILL! RUN!

1002
01:14:54,257 --> 01:14:55,556
>> AAH!

1003
01:15:01,763 --> 01:15:03,631
AAH!

1004
01:15:03,633 --> 01:15:05,433
COME ON. COME ON.

1005
01:15:05,435 --> 01:15:06,367
DAVID!

1006
01:15:06,369 --> 01:15:07,835
TO THE BASEMENT. LET'S GO!

1007
01:15:11,374 --> 01:15:13,608
COME ON.

1008
01:15:21,284 --> 01:15:23,317
SHE'LL COME DOWN HERE.

1009
01:15:23,319 --> 01:15:24,185
SHE HAS TO.

1010
01:15:24,187 --> 01:15:27,321
LAUREN'S BODY IS TOO WEAK.

1011
01:15:27,323 --> 01:15:29,423
SHE'LL NEED ONE OF US.

1012
01:15:29,425 --> 01:15:30,024
IT'S NOT GONNA BE YOU.

1013
01:15:30,026 --> 01:15:31,692
IF WE BOTH GRAB HER, THEN WE
CAN PUT HER BACK.

1014
01:15:31,694 --> 01:15:33,594
NO, IT'S TOO DANGEROUS.

1015
01:15:33,596 --> 01:15:34,595
YOU STAY AWAY FROM HER.

1016
01:15:34,597 --> 01:15:35,863
I'LL GET HER BACK IN THE BOX.

1017
01:15:35,865 --> 01:15:38,599
IT'S THE ONLY WAY TO
DESTROY HER.

1018
01:15:38,601 --> 01:15:41,903
IT'LL BE OKAY.

1019
01:15:52,247 --> 01:15:56,350
MY LITTLE PUSS-PUSS.

1020
01:15:56,352 --> 01:15:59,387
GATITA.

1021
01:15:59,389 --> 01:16:01,722
WHAT?

1022
01:16:01,724 --> 01:16:03,291
YOUR MOTHER USED TO CALL YOU

1023
01:16:03,293 --> 01:16:07,395
THAT WHEN YOU WERE LITTLE.

1024
01:16:07,397 --> 01:16:11,232
YOU NEVER TOLD ME THAT.

1025
01:16:11,234 --> 01:16:14,435
ONE DAY, YOU STOOD UP ON THIS

1026
01:16:14,437 --> 01:16:18,139
CHAIR AND YOU SAID, "I AM NOT A

1027
01:16:18,141 --> 01:16:20,908
LITTLE KITTY, AND MY NAME IS

1028
01:16:20,910 --> 01:16:21,842
JILL."

1029
01:16:21,844 --> 01:16:23,578
REALLY?

1030
01:16:25,014 --> 01:16:28,082
DAVID.

1031
01:16:28,084 --> 01:16:32,653
YOU CAN'T HIDE FROM ME.

1032
01:16:32,655 --> 01:16:37,024
SHE WAS SO...

1033
01:16:37,026 --> 01:16:37,992
PASSIONATE.

1034
01:16:37,994 --> 01:16:41,162
SO STRONG. REMEMBER?

1035
01:16:41,164 --> 01:16:43,564
I REALIZED TOO LATE THAT'S WHY I

1036
01:16:43,566 --> 01:16:44,732
FELL IN LOVE WITH HER.

1037
01:16:44,734 --> 01:16:48,336
SHE WASN'T GONNA GET ANY BETTER.

1038
01:16:48,338 --> 01:16:51,072
SHE KNEW IT, TOO.

1039
01:16:51,074 --> 01:16:52,106
I'M SORRY.

1040
01:16:53,643 --> 01:16:56,043
I'M SO SORRY.

1041
01:17:02,451 --> 01:17:05,820
YOU'RE A LOT LIKE HER, YOU KNOW?

1042
01:17:07,557 --> 01:17:11,225
YEAH?

1043
01:17:11,227 --> 01:17:12,526
DAVID!

1044
01:17:15,098 --> 01:17:16,497
LISTEN, YOU HAVE TO HIDE,
OKAY?

1045
01:17:16,499 --> 01:17:20,368
PROMISE ME YOU WON'T COME OUT
UNTIL AFTER SHE'S GONE, OKAY?

1046
01:17:20,370 --> 01:17:20,968
I LOVE YOU, DAD.

1047
01:17:20,970 --> 01:17:22,837
I LOVE YOU, GATITA.

1048
01:17:22,839 --> 01:17:26,140
FROM THE MOMENT YOU WERE BORN.

1049
01:17:26,142 --> 01:17:28,376
OKAY.

1050
01:17:38,720 --> 01:17:40,955
DAVID.

1051
01:17:54,936 --> 01:17:58,005
I'M FINISHED WITH THIS BODY,
DAVID.

1052
01:17:58,007 --> 01:18:01,676
AND NOW I WANT YOURS.

1053
01:18:07,917 --> 01:18:11,519
MARCELA?

1054
01:18:11,521 --> 01:18:13,921
NO. NO.

1055
01:18:13,923 --> 01:18:15,489
SHALL I

1056
01:18:15,491 --> 01:18:16,724
CONTINUE?

1057
01:18:16,726 --> 01:18:17,558
DON'T.

1058
01:18:17,560 --> 01:18:18,926
IT'S NOT YOU.

1059
01:18:18,928 --> 01:18:19,660
MORE?

1060
01:18:19,662 --> 01:18:22,496
IT'S NOT YOU. NO.

1061
01:18:22,498 --> 01:18:24,999
IT'S NOT YOU!

1062
01:18:34,042 --> 01:18:37,178
GIVE YOURSELF TO ME!

1063
01:18:40,716 --> 01:18:42,950
YOU ARE TOO WEAK TO PUT ME BACK

1064
01:18:42,952 --> 01:18:45,286
IN THE BOX!

1065
01:19:01,303 --> 01:19:05,072
I CAN'T.

1066
01:19:05,074 --> 01:19:08,709
IT'S MARCELA, BABY.

1067
01:19:15,283 --> 01:19:17,885
MARCELA.

1068
01:19:17,887 --> 01:19:19,553
MARCELA.

1069
01:19:19,555 --> 01:19:21,789
MARCELA.

1070
01:19:30,232 --> 01:19:30,831
PLEASE.

1071
01:19:30,833 --> 01:19:32,533
 MARCELA.

1072
01:19:32,535 --> 01:19:33,567
LET ME GO.

1073
01:19:33,569 --> 01:19:36,237
MARCELA.

1074
01:19:36,239 --> 01:19:38,038
KILL ME AGAIN.

1075
01:19:38,040 --> 01:19:41,308
I CAN'T. I CAN'T.

1076
01:19:41,310 --> 01:19:42,810
I CAN'T.

1077
01:19:42,812 --> 01:19:45,379
I CAN'T.

1078
01:19:45,381 --> 01:19:48,048
>> YOU ARE USELESS TO ME.

1079
01:19:55,257 --> 01:19:57,424
YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHAT I'M GONNA

1080
01:19:57,426 --> 01:19:59,193
DO WITH YOUR BODY.

1081
01:19:59,195 --> 01:20:01,529
YOU DON'T KNOW ALL MY
SECRETS.

1082
01:20:01,531 --> 01:20:02,329
NO!

1083
01:20:11,240 --> 01:20:14,241
>> NO!

1084
01:20:14,243 --> 01:20:18,579
>> DAD, DAD, SHUT THE DOOR.

1085
01:20:18,581 --> 01:20:20,247
SHUT THE DOOR.

1086
01:20:20,249 --> 01:20:22,683
WHAT DID YOU DO?

1087
01:20:22,685 --> 01:20:24,652
COME ON. PLEASE.

1088
01:20:24,654 --> 01:20:26,854
PLEASE!

1089
01:20:26,856 --> 01:20:29,156
JUST DO IT!

1090
01:20:29,158 --> 01:20:32,960
I LOVE YOU, DADDY.

1091
01:20:32,962 --> 01:20:34,929
NO, WAIT! WHAT ARE YOU DOING?!

1092
01:20:34,931 --> 01:20:36,063
NO, NO!
DAD!

1093
01:20:36,065 --> 01:20:37,097
LISTEN TO ME.

1094
01:20:37,099 --> 01:20:38,532
I WON'T LEAVE YOU.

1095
01:20:38,534 --> 01:20:39,500
YOU HAVE TO GO!

1096
01:20:39,502 --> 01:20:40,835
NO, YOU HAVE TO GO!

1097
01:20:40,837 --> 01:20:42,970
YOU HAVE TO GO!

1098
01:20:42,972 --> 01:20:44,905
I LOVE YOU.

1099
01:20:44,907 --> 01:20:46,106
I'M SO SCARED, DAD.

1100
01:20:46,108 --> 01:20:47,341
NO, DEAR GOD. TAKE ME.

1101
01:20:47,343 --> 01:20:49,043
NO, NO. JILL. JILL.
JILL.

1102
01:20:53,449 --> 01:20:55,816
NO!

1103
01:20:58,687 --> 01:21:00,688
TAKE ME.

1104
01:21:00,690 --> 01:21:04,158
TAKE ME.

1105
01:21:04,160 --> 01:21:07,661
IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE ME!

1106
01:21:33,522 --> 01:21:35,623
AAH!

1107
01:21:53,074 --> 01:21:54,909
 DON'T LEAVE ME

1108
01:21:54,911 --> 01:21:57,044
HERE TO DIE.

1109
01:21:57,046 --> 01:21:59,179
LIKE MOM.

1110
01:22:18,400 --> 01:22:23,871
IT ALL STARTED WITH A SECRET.

1111
01:22:23,873 --> 01:22:27,141
WE ALL HAVE THEM.

1112
01:22:27,143 --> 01:22:29,977
EVERYONE'S IS DIFFERENT.

1113
01:22:37,252 --> 01:22:42,456
MOST SECRETS DON'T CARRY MUCH
WEIGHT.

1114
01:22:42,458 --> 01:22:45,559
BUT SOME...

1115
01:22:45,561 --> 01:22:47,628
SOME SECRETS CAN DESTROY

1116
01:22:47,630 --> 01:22:50,097
EVERYTHING YOU LOVE.

1117
01:22:53,902 --> 01:22:56,437
I'LL BRING JILL HOME.

1118
01:22:59,174 --> 01:23:01,575
I WILL NOT QUIT.

1119
01:23:04,279 --> 01:23:06,714
I WILL FIND A WAY.

1120
01:23:12,187 --> 01:23:14,388
I WILL GET MY DAUGHTER BACK.

1121
01:23:17,560 --> 01:23:19,827
DADDY.
