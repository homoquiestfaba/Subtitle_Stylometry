Hey, Lexi.
It's me, Mikey.

28
00:02:33,518 --> 00:02:34,451
Mikey.

29
00:02:34,484 --> 00:02:36,818
No, no, no, no. Don't hang up.
Don't hang up.

30
00:02:36,852 --> 00:02:40,818
I got a big fucking
surprise for you.

31
00:02:43,785 --> 00:02:46,085
- WOMAN: Who is it?
- I was cleaning...

32
00:02:46,118 --> 00:02:47,985
Hey! Surprise!

33
00:02:48,018 --> 00:02:49,918
Hey. Hey, Lil.

34
00:02:49,952 --> 00:02:51,752
Oh, my shit.

35
00:02:51,785 --> 00:02:53,752
(CHUCKLES) Nice to see
you, too, uh...

36
00:02:53,785 --> 00:02:55,118
How you been?
How you been?

37
00:02:56,451 --> 00:02:58,118
Okay...

38
00:02:58,152 --> 00:03:00,985
- It's me, Mikey. Remember me?
- I know.

39
00:03:01,018 --> 00:03:03,052
I know.
What are you doing here for?

40
00:03:03,085 --> 00:03:05,118
Well, I just
came to see Lexi,

41
00:03:05,152 --> 00:03:06,585
and, well, I came
to see you of course.

42
00:03:06,618 --> 00:03:08,518
Both of you guys.
But is Lexi here right now?

43
00:03:08,918 --> 00:03:09,985
LIL: Lexi!

44
00:03:10,018 --> 00:03:11,052
- Thank you.
- LEXI: What?

45
00:03:11,085 --> 00:03:12,852
LIL: You won't believe
who's here.

46
00:03:13,518 --> 00:03:14,918
Oh, my gosh.

47
00:03:16,785 --> 00:03:18,052
Oh, my shit.

48
00:03:18,085 --> 00:03:19,518
Surprise!

00:03:19,551 --> 00:03:21,852
Oh, my God, what the...
What are you doing here?

50
00:03:21,885 --> 00:03:23,852
Aw! It's good
to see you, too.

51
00:03:23,885 --> 00:03:24,952
Why are you here?

52
00:03:24,985 --> 00:03:27,118
Fuck. Oh, God damn it.
Where do I begin. Uh, look...

53
00:03:27,152 --> 00:03:28,451
No, you're not coming
in this house.

54
00:03:28,484 --> 00:03:29,852
- All beat up.
- That's right.

55
00:03:29,885 --> 00:03:31,718
- What... What the fuck?
- All right...

56
00:03:31,751 --> 00:03:34,085
All right, well,
I'll tell you what's...

57
00:03:34,118 --> 00:03:36,085
Yeah,
why are you here?

58
00:03:36,118 --> 00:03:37,686
- LIL: Yeah.
- MIKEY: Uh, well...

59
00:03:37,718 --> 00:03:38,618
LIL: Why are you here?

60
00:03:38,652 --> 00:03:40,052
Mom, Mom,
can you give me a minute?

61
00:03:40,085 --> 00:03:41,118
Lil, I just wanted
to come in,

62
00:03:41,152 --> 00:03:42,518
and hang
for a couple of days.

63
00:03:42,551 --> 00:03:44,085
No, you're not
coming in here.

64
00:03:44,118 --> 00:03:45,152
LIL: You're not coming
in my house.

65
00:03:45,185 --> 00:03:47,518
Mom, can you
just go inside and...

66
00:03:48,585 --> 00:03:50,952
- The fuck, Mikey?
- I... I know.

67
00:03:50,985 --> 00:03:52,551
I know.
This is unexpected.

68
00:03:52,585 --> 00:03:54,652
Oh, nothing with you
is unexpected.

69
00:03:54,686 --> 00:03:57,551
(LAUGHS)
You still got that sass!

70
00:03:58,152 --> 00:03:59,718
(CHUCKLES SARCASTICALLY)

71
00:03:59,751 --> 00:04:01,785
Look, I don't know
what you want,

72
00:04:01,818 --> 00:04:03,619
but I can't help you.

73
00:04:03,652 --> 00:04:06,685
So it doesn't matter how
or why you're here.

74
00:04:06,718 --> 00:04:07,852
Go away.

75
00:04:08,718 --> 00:04:11,585
- MIKEY: Hey, Lil.
- LEXI: Ma!

76
00:04:11,619 --> 00:04:13,484
- God damn it.
- Look, I don't want

77
00:04:13,518 --> 00:04:14,451
to be here, all right?
This is embarrassing.

78
00:04:14,484 --> 00:04:15,418
LEXI: Well, I don't
want you here either.

79
00:04:15,451 --> 00:04:16,652
You think I want to
show up like this?

80
00:04:16,685 --> 00:04:18,918
I got my ass fuckin' kicked.
I just need a place to crash.

81
00:04:18,952 --> 00:04:20,585
- Why can't you be cool?
- What does it look like?

82
00:04:20,619 --> 00:04:22,085
- A hotel?
- Really? It's like that?

83
00:04:22,118 --> 00:04:24,418
Can you get off
the property, please?

84
00:04:24,451 --> 00:04:26,551
What, why... What are you
fucking going do? Really?

85
00:04:26,586 --> 00:04:27,952
Well, you...
Oh, you want me to call the cops?

86
00:04:27,985 --> 00:04:29,484
- I'll call the cops.
- Don't. Don't fucking...

87
00:04:29,518 --> 00:04:31,384
- No, I'm calling the cops.
- Fuck!

88
00:04:31,418 --> 00:04:32,985
- Nine, eight...
- God...

89

LEXI: Seven... Faster!

90
00:04:35,052 --> 00:04:36,518
I'm technically
off the property,

91
00:04:36,551 --> 00:04:37,619
so you can't
call the cops,

92
00:04:37,651 --> 00:04:40,551
because I'm on public land
respecting your boundaries!

93
00:04:40,586 --> 00:04:42,451
- Can you keep it down?
- Can you come over here

94
00:04:42,484 --> 00:04:44,484
so I don't have to project my
voice, please?

95
00:04:44,518 --> 00:04:46,118
Oh, fuck!

96
00:04:46,152 --> 00:04:47,351
(FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING)

97
00:04:47,384 --> 00:04:49,918
Seriously, I just need a place
to crash for a couple of days.

98
00:04:49,952 --> 00:04:53,085
- What's the big deal?
- Mikey, go fuck yourself.

99
00:04:53,118 --> 00:04:55,052
Oh, you don't even know
what I've been through.

100
00:04:55,085 --> 00:04:56,918
- Oh, right.
- Look at my fucking face!

101
00:04:56,952 --> 00:04:58,619
I just was
on a bus for two days.

102
00:04:58,651 --> 00:05:00,451
I had to walk here
from the bus station...

103
00:05:00,484 --> 00:05:01,852
Why don't you stay
with your mama!

104
00:05:01,885 --> 00:05:03,852
My mom's in a nursing home
in Le Marque.

105
00:05:03,885 --> 00:05:05,751
A care home.
I can't sleep there.

106
00:05:06,885 --> 00:05:08,451
Mikey,
what do you want?

107
00:05:08,484 --> 00:05:09,751
- My God, I just...
- What do you want?

108
00:05:09,785 --> 00:05:10,952
I just fucking told you.

109
00:05:10,985 --> 00:05:13,586
I just need to crash
for a couple days.

110
00:05:13,618 --> 00:05:14,751
What, you want money,
right? Here.

111
00:05:14,785 --> 00:05:18,718
- I don't want fucking money.
- I got 22 fucking dollars.

112
00:05:18,751 --> 00:05:20,518
Here, come get it.
I can't come on your property.

113
00:05:20,552 --> 00:05:22,418
- Come get your money.
- You should've called!

114
00:05:22,451 --> 00:05:25,018
If I would've called,
you would've said "no."

115
00:05:25,052 --> 00:05:26,818
I'm still saying "no,"

116
00:05:26,852 --> 00:05:28,152
so you fucked yourself
by coming.

117
00:05:28,185 --> 00:05:30,586
Oh, please, come on.
You know me.

118
00:05:30,618 --> 00:05:31,818
Damn straight, I do.

119
00:05:31,852 --> 00:05:32,885
You know me
and you know

120
00:05:32,918 --> 00:05:33,952
I wouldn't be
literally begging

121
00:05:33,985 --> 00:05:35,018
if I had
somewhere to go.

122
00:05:35,052 --> 00:05:36,085
And if you don't
let me in,

123
00:05:36,118 --> 00:05:38,052
I'm going to sleep in
Tarpey fucking Park tonight,

124
00:05:38,085 --> 00:05:39,384
is that what you want?

125
00:05:39,418 --> 00:05:40,451
You said
you were never going

126
00:05:40,484 --> 00:05:42,085
to step a foot
in Texas again.

127
00:05:42,118 --> 00:05:44,852
And then the world fucked
me, what can I say.

128
00:05:45,585 --> 00:05:47,618
- Peek-a-boo!
- Ma!

129
00:05:47,651 --> 00:05:49,152
See, your mom's saying,
"Let him in.

130
00:05:49,185 --> 00:05:50,552
"Let him in
and take a shower."

131
00:05:50,585 --> 00:05:51,651
And the dog's like,

132
00:05:51,685 --> 00:05:54,085
"Oh, he's a good man,
I can tell by his nice energy."

133
00:05:54,118 --> 00:05:56,484
Please let me take
a fucking shower.

00:05:56,519 --> 00:05:57,751

with my own eyes,</i>

138
00:06:21,551 --> 00:06:22,485
<i>I wouldn't believe it.</i>

139
00:06:22,519 --> 00:06:24,485
The place turned
into a fucking trap house

140
00:06:24,519 --> 00:06:25,751
right under my nose.

141
00:06:25,785 --> 00:06:28,018
Fucking Speigler sends me
some scraggly bitch from Ohio

142
00:06:28,052 --> 00:06:29,785
that he promised
would be chill.

143
00:06:29,818 --> 00:06:31,585
Her first night in the
house, she gets in a fight,

144
00:06:31,618 --> 00:06:33,152
knocks this
fucking bitch out.

145
00:06:33,185 --> 00:06:35,885
Crack. Right in front of me.
I was like, "Holy shit!"

146
00:06:35,918 --> 00:06:37,052
So, anyway, she bounced.

147
00:06:37,085 --> 00:06:39,551
Now, I got to fill the room
so I don't lose the month

148
00:06:39,585 --> 00:06:40,852
and her friend comes
and stays there

149
00:06:40,885 --> 00:06:42,418
and gets high
the whole fucking time.

150
00:06:42,452 --> 00:06:43,785
Why didn't you just
kick the bitch out?

151
00:06:43,818 --> 00:06:44,918
Well, I had seven hoes

152
00:06:44,952 --> 00:06:47,085
and they're letting MS-13
deal drugs the whole time.

153
00:06:47,118 --> 00:06:49,452
Lil, MS13 is a gang you
don't want to fuck with.

154
00:06:49,485 --> 00:06:51,518
You're good? You're good?
Okay. You need any coffee?

155
00:06:51,551 --> 00:06:53,118
All right. Sorry.
So, anyway.

156
00:06:53,152 --> 00:06:55,685
Long story short.
I ended up hiding out in my room,

157
00:06:55,718 --> 00:06:57,751
because these dudes were
straight fucking killers

158
00:06:57,785 --> 00:06:59,018
and I didn't wanna
fucking get killed

159
00:06:59,052 --> 00:07:00,818
so I played video games
the whole time.

160
00:07:00,852 --> 00:07:02,651
Remember the house
in Chatsworth?

161
00:07:02,685 --> 00:07:04,685
- LEXI: Mm-hmm.
- Well, this place was, like,

162
00:07:04,718 --> 00:07:06,685
maybe five times bigger.
Beautiful house.

163
00:07:06,718 --> 00:07:07,818
I had a two-year lease

164
00:07:07,852 --> 00:07:09,685
with an option to buy it at
the end of the lease, right?

165
00:07:09,718 --> 00:07:13,152
Well... (CHUCKLES) As usual,
shit got fucking crazy.

166
00:07:13,185 --> 00:07:15,618
I snapped, I got up in
one of those cholos' faces

167
00:07:15,651 --> 00:07:16,818
because I'm not
a little bitch.

168
00:07:16,852 --> 00:07:18,818
I came this fucking close
to getting shot.

169
00:07:18,852 --> 00:07:20,485
This fucking close.

170
00:07:20,518 --> 00:07:21,751
So then I had to crash

175

his back door open

176

got out and got killed.

he fucked the night before.

00:41:54,751 --> 00:41:58,518
Um, what do you call
a Jamaican donut?

1007
00:41:59,985 --> 00:42:02,718
Hmm, I like where this is going.
Give me a minute.

1008
00:42:02,751 --> 00:42:05,585
Uh, Jamaican donut, huh?
I'm stumped.

1009
00:42:06,418 --> 00:42:09,018
Cinnamaan. (LAUGHS)

1010
00:42:09,052 --> 00:42:10,451
- I got to go.
- (CHUCKLES) No.

1011
00:42:10,484 --> 00:42:11,785
No, no, seriously,
that was really...

1012
00:42:11,818 --> 00:42:13,484
That hurt my feelings,
that was terrible.

1013
00:42:13,518 --> 00:42:15,518
- (LAUGHS)
- That's okay, I forgive you.

1014
00:42:15,551 --> 00:42:18,484
- So Raylee, I'm thinking...
- Call me Strawberry.

1015
00:42:20,585 --> 00:42:22,384
- Call you what?
- Strawberry.

1016
00:42:22,418 --> 00:42:23,518
- Strawberry?
- Mm-hmm.

1017
00:42:23,551 --> 00:42:25,451
- Everybody calls me that.
- You're kidding.

1018
00:42:25,985 --> 00:42:28,085
Okay. How old are you?

1019
00:42:28,118 --> 00:42:29,952
- Who's asking?
- Me.

1020
00:42:29,985 --> 00:42:31,651
- Why?
- Come on.

1021
00:42:31,685 --> 00:42:33,918
- I'm old enough.
- For what?

1022
00:42:35,451 --> 00:42:39,551
Oh, God. I'll be 18
in three weeks, okay?

1023
00:42:39,585 --> 00:42:41,585
(SIGHS) I knew it,
you're too old for me.

1024
00:42:41,618 --> 00:42:43,484
(GIGGLES)

1025
00:42:43,518 --> 00:42:45,085
Anyway, Strawberry.

1026
00:42:45,118 --> 00:42:47,052
I can't believe that's
your name (CHUCKLES)

1027
00:42:47,085 --> 00:42:48,651
I don't know
what donut to get.

1028
00:42:48,685 --> 00:42:49,651
I need your help.

1029
00:42:49,685 --> 00:42:52,451
I really like the look
of those donut holes.

1030
00:42:52,484 --> 00:42:53,585
And those, you know...

1031
00:42:53,618 --> 00:42:55,818
Do you frost, do you do the
sprinkles, do you do those?

1032
00:42:55,852 --> 00:42:56,785
How... Who makes them?

1033
00:42:56,818 --> 00:42:58,918
I do the sprinkles,
and I fill the cream.

1034
00:42:58,952 --> 00:43:00,018
- You fill the cream.
- Yeah.

1035
00:43:00,052 --> 00:43:01,085
I just want the ones
that you make.

1036
00:43:01,118 --> 00:43:02,384
- Okay. (CHUCKLES)
- I want the ones

1037
00:43:02,418 --> 00:43:03,551
- that you cream-filled.
- (CHUCKLES)

1038
00:43:03,585 --> 00:43:05,152
Does that sound...
Oh, I don't want to get you in trouble.

1039
00:43:05,185 --> 00:43:06,651
(MIKEY CLEARS THROAT)

1040
00:43:06,685 --> 00:43:08,918
I'm thinking
maybe a chocolate round,

1041
00:43:08,952 --> 00:43:11,852
or maybe I'll get
a strawberry-filled.

1042
00:43:11,885 --> 00:43:14,618
- No pun intended.
- (GIGGLES) Oh, God.

1043
00:43:14,651 --> 00:43:16,484
MIKEY: (WHISPERS SOFTLY) I don't
think she likes me very much.

1044
00:43:16,518 --> 00:43:18,518
(WHISPERING) I don't think
she likes anyone very much.

1045
00:43:18,551 --> 00:43:20,551
(WHISPERING) Yeah,
she's a mean boss.

1046
00:43:20,585 --> 00:43:22,651
Anyway, okay.
So, yes, I've decided.

1047
00:43:22,685 --> 00:43:24,384
Chocolate round.

1048
00:43:24,418 --> 00:43:27,685
Okay, but you want
chocolate sprinkles?

1049
00:43:27,718 --> 00:43:29,384
Chocolate cake?

1050
00:43:29,418 --> 00:43:30,785
Chocolate Bavarian cream?

1051
00:43:30,818 --> 00:43:31,918
There's all those
different chocolates?

1052
00:43:31,952 --> 00:43:33,018
- (GIGGLING) Mm-hmm.
- Oh, no.

1053
00:43:33,052 --> 00:43:34,384
Now I got to stay here

1054
00:43:34,418 --> 00:43:35,551
for a few more hours
and decide.

1055
00:43:35,585 --> 00:43:36,985
- Son of a bitch.
- (GIGGLES)

1056
00:43:37,018 --> 00:43:38,085
Are you trying
to keep me here?

1057
00:43:38,118 --> 00:43:39,152
'Cause
I'll sit in the corner

1058
00:43:39,185 --> 00:43:41,152
and contemplate this for
a while until you get off.

1059
00:43:41,185 --> 00:43:42,118
What time do you get off?

1060
00:43:42,152 --> 00:43:44,785
MIKEY: <i>Oh, feels
so fucking good!</i>

1061
00:43:44,818 --> 00:43:46,918
- Oh, shit! Fuck, yeah, babe!
- (MOANING)

1062
00:43:46,952 --> 00:43:49,052
- Yeah, you like that shit?
- Oh, yeah.

1063
00:43:49,085 --> 00:43:50,751
You like that big dick
inside of you,

1064
00:43:50,785 --> 00:43:52,484
- you fucking little slut.
- God, I love this big dick.

1065
00:43:52,518 --> 00:43:54,685
(BOTH PANTING)

1066
00:43:54,718 --> 00:43:57,918
- Not bad, huh?
- No, not bad at all.

1067
00:43:57,952 --> 00:44:00,818
And I didn't even have to take
one of my magic pills. Hmm.

1068
00:44:03,418 --> 00:44:06,018
Uh, I didn't know
you were usin' 'em.

1069
00:44:06,052 --> 00:44:07,785
- MIKEY: Well, yeah.
- Oh.

1070
00:44:07,818 --> 00:44:10,785
You remember how hard it is
to keep wood on set all day.

1071
00:44:10,818 --> 00:44:12,785
Yeah. (SIGHS)

1072
00:44:12,818 --> 00:44:15,518
Remember when Kristina Rose
almost broke it off?

1073
00:44:15,551 --> 00:44:17,152
(CHUCKLING) I do. I do.

1074
00:44:17,185 --> 00:44:19,085
I'm surprised
it even works at all.

1075
00:44:19,118 --> 00:44:21,118
- Oh, it sure works.
- (PATTING)

1076
00:44:21,152 --> 00:44:23,751
Oh, yeah. (CHUCKLES)

1077
00:44:27,484 --> 00:44:29,685
Love the exterior
decorating, sir.

1078
00:44:29,718 --> 00:44:30,751
It's looking spiffy.

1079
00:44:38,651 --> 00:44:40,618
All right, Dad,
we'll be back around 5:00.

1080
00:44:44,885 --> 00:44:47,052
MIKEY: You think
he remembers me?

1081
00:44:47,085 --> 00:44:49,818
LONNIE: Man,
ever since my mom died,

1082
00:44:49,852 --> 00:44:52,651
all he cares about is keeping
this place immaculate.

1083
00:44:54,484 --> 00:44:56,418
MIKEY: Matter of fact,
I've been screwed out

1084
00:44:56,451 --> 00:44:58,585
of Male Performer of the year
literally five times.

1085
00:44:58,618 --> 00:44:59,952
But you know what?

1086
00:44:59,985 --> 00:45:01,384
I don't say shit,
it's all good.

1087
00:45:01,418 --> 00:45:02,618
I'm a team player.

1088
00:45:02,651 --> 00:45:03,918
Almost every single girl
I did a scene with

1089
00:45:03,952 --> 00:45:05,718
started fucking me
off-camera, right?

1090
00:45:05,751 --> 00:45:07,018
But the agents hate that shit.

1091
00:45:07,052 --> 00:45:08,852
But what do they expect?
You know?

1092
00:45:08,885 --> 00:45:10,885
It's like, girl comes by
my model house,

1093
00:45:10,918 --> 00:45:13,418
they see my Hall of Fame
trophy on the mantelpiece.

1094
00:45:13,451 --> 00:45:15,985
They're like, "Oh, my God.
He's famous for fucking."

1095
00:45:16,018 --> 00:45:17,785
LONNIE: Wait,
you used to have your own model house?

1096
00:45:17,818 --> 00:45:19,818
I had three
model houses, bro.

1097
00:45:19,852 --> 00:45:23,618
And the last one...
Ooh, that was a savage-ass house.

1098
00:45:23,651 --> 00:45:25,952
Till I started letting agents
book bottom bitches in there.

1099
00:45:25,985 --> 00:45:27,118
Bottom bitches?

1100
00:45:27,153 --> 00:45:28,418
Yeah, bottom bitches

1101
00:45:28,451 --> 00:45:29,585
are technically
the best of the hookers,

1102
00:45:29,618 --> 00:45:30,852
but they're
still the hookers,

1103
00:45:30,885 --> 00:45:31,952
and that's what
they started sending me,

1104
00:45:31,985 --> 00:45:33,153
was the fucking hookers.

1105
00:45:33,186 --> 00:45:34,285
And that's when
everything went to shit.

1106
00:45:34,319 --> 00:45:37,451
'Cause see, once a porn chick
gets a hooker mentality,

1107
00:45:37,484 --> 00:45:38,918
they become
a fucking nightmare.

1108
00:45:38,952 --> 00:45:40,885
A real pain in my ass.

1109
00:45:40,918 --> 00:45:42,384
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

1110
00:45:42,418 --> 00:45:44,618
Dude, I forgot how hot
Gulf Coast bitches are.

1111
00:45:44,651 --> 00:45:46,718
I saw this girl over by the
donut shop at the refinery.

1112
00:45:46,751 --> 00:45:48,119
She works there,
smokin' hot.

1113
00:45:48,153 --> 00:45:49,451
Gorgeous,
drop dead gorgeous.

1114
00:45:49,484 --> 00:45:52,018
And get this,
17 years old.

1115
00:45:52,052 --> 00:45:54,052
(SINGSONG)
Legal as an eagle.

1116

- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

1117
00:45:59,052 --> 00:46:01,651
Hey, man, see that strip
of land over there?

1118
00:46:01,685 --> 00:46:03,052
Yeah?

1119
00:46:03,085 --> 00:46:05,518
Them's the Texas
