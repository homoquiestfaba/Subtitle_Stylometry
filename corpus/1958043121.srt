1
00:00:55,456 --> 00:00:57,287
Salve.

2
00:00:58,091 --> 00:00:59,524
Salve!

3
00:01:00,994 --> 00:01:01,392
All's ready.

4
00:01:01,995 --> 00:01:02,757
Where's the prisoner?

5
00:01:13,006 --> 00:01:13,938
That's him?

6
00:01:15,909 --> 00:01:16,568
...this?

7
00:01:17,677 --> 00:01:20,703
Such a threat that he is
banished to this desolate isle?

8
00:01:28,788 --> 00:01:29,777
Aughhh...

9
00:01:30,790 --> 00:01:31,984
'ave they gone mad in Rome?

10
00:01:32,058 --> 00:01:33,650
Watch your words Titus.

11
00:01:38,998 --> 00:01:40,863
Really... why is he here?

12
00:01:41,868 --> 00:01:43,699
Dominus et Deus.

13
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:44,361
What?

14
00:01:46,005 --> 00:01:50,567
Dominus et Deus... Lord and God.

15
00:01:50,643 --> 00:01:55,546
That is what Emperor
Domitian demands to be called.

16
00:01:55,648 --> 00:01:56,706
And?

17
00:01:56,850 --> 00:02:00,047
There is only one Lord and God.

18
00:02:00,186 --> 00:02:02,552
The one I serve.

19
00:02:02,655 --> 00:02:04,885
So they sent him here for that?

20
00:02:04,958 --> 00:02:07,825
Refusing to acknowledge
the Emperor as God?

21
00:02:07,894 --> 00:02:09,953
Why didn't they just kill him?

22
00:02:10,029 --> 00:02:10,996
They tried...

23
00:02:12,465 --> 00:02:14,160
'cept 'e wouldn't die.

24
00:02:19,005 --> 00:02:20,597
What do you mean?

25
00:02:20,673 --> 00:02:24,734
Jus' that. The old man won't die.

26
00:02:24,811 --> 00:02:27,780
He's a Christian of some influence.

27
00:02:27,847 --> 00:02:31,681
He incites others to
follow his so-called savior.

28
00:02:31,784 --> 00:02:35,515
Jesus Christ... the Son of God.

29
00:02:35,588 --> 00:02:40,685
He was warned, imprisoned,
and finally... boiled.

30
00:02:41,828 --> 00:02:42,624
Boiled?

31
00:02:42,695 --> 00:02:43,491
Right.

32
00:02:43,596 --> 00:02:44,494
But...

33
00:02:44,564 --> 00:02:46,589
That's just it. He wouldn't...

34
00:02:46,666 --> 00:02:47,860
Nothing happened.

35
00:02:48,001 --> 00:02:48,831
Nonsense!

36
00:02:48,902 --> 00:02:49,766
ls it?

37
00:02:49,836 --> 00:02:51,497
Why do you think we're here then?

38
00:02:51,671 --> 00:02:54,469
He wouldn't recant his
allegiance to this...

39
00:02:54,541 --> 00:02:56,509
Jesus Christ

40
00:02:56,576 --> 00:02:58,601
or stop teaching about him.

41
00:02:58,678 --> 00:03:00,009
How can I?

42
00:03:00,079 --> 00:03:03,480
Jesus gave his life for me...

43
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:05,177
and for you as well.

44
00:03:05,251 --> 00:03:06,616
For everyone!

45
00:03:06,686 --> 00:03:12,784
He died on the cross to pay for
our sins and bring us close to God.

46
00:03:12,859 --> 00:03:19,162
He rose from the dead and lives
and has called us as His witnesses.

47
00:03:19,232 --> 00:03:22,668
His words bring life and joy.

48
00:03:22,735 --> 00:03:27,172
Can I withhold such
wonderful truth from others?

49
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:30,038
I tell you, I cannot!

50
00:03:31,177 --> 00:03:34,772
Well, it hardly did you any good
now did it ya stubborn ol'fool?

51
00:03:36,082 --> 00:03:37,640
Could've saved yourself
all this misery...

52
00:03:37,717 --> 00:03:40,652
and lived your old
age with some pleasure!

53
00:03:40,753 --> 00:03:41,742
Eh, Pulo?

54
00:03:41,821 --> 00:03:43,618
You are a soldier.

55
00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:45,487
That I am, old man!

56
00:03:45,558 --> 00:03:46,855
And a loyal one too...

57
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:48,621
and always will be.

58
00:03:49,662 --> 00:03:55,794
Then you will understand what it means
to defend something that you believe in.

59
00:03:55,902 --> 00:04:00,737
I am honored to be here for
Christ in these chains...

60
00:04:00,807 --> 00:04:03,105
on this barren island.

61
00:04:03,943 --> 00:04:05,001
And you?

62
00:04:05,078 --> 00:04:08,844
Are you honored to be
here for your empire?

63
00:04:09,983 --> 00:04:10,745
Ahhh!

64
00:04:10,817 --> 00:04:15,254
Yeah, he got you on that one, Titus!

65
00:04:16,856 --> 00:04:18,221
He's a crazy as they come!

66
00:04:18,291 --> 00:04:20,919
But how do you know, old man.

67
00:04:20,994 --> 00:04:24,054
How are you so certain
that this Jesus...

68
00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:25,028
that he is...

69
00:04:25,098 --> 00:04:26,690
what did he say?...

70
00:04:27,166 --> 00:04:28,895
The Son of God?

71
00:04:32,071 --> 00:04:34,596
Because I was there.

72
00:04:39,145 --> 00:04:40,305
There were signs...

73
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:41,911
from the very beginning...

74
00:04:43,616 --> 00:04:44,776
and a prophecy...

75
00:04:46,085 --> 00:04:49,282
The Lord himself shall give you a sign:

76
00:04:49,355 --> 00:04:52,722
Behold, the virgin
shall conceive and bear

77
00:04:52,825 --> 00:04:56,784
a Son and shall call His name, Immanuel:

78
00:04:59,132 --> 00:05:01,225
which means 'God with us. '

79
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:02,734
A virgin?

80
00:05:02,802 --> 00:05:04,030
A virgin?...

81
00:05:04,103 --> 00:05:06,765
...that's impossible!

82
00:05:06,906 --> 00:05:08,339
Not with God.

83
00:05:10,610 --> 00:05:16,207
He sent an angel to a city
in Galilee, to a virgin.

84
00:05:25,091 --> 00:05:27,150
Blessed are you among all women Mary!

85
00:05:28,194 --> 00:05:28,592
What?

86
00:05:28,661 --> 00:05:30,094
Who - who are you?

87
00:05:30,196 --> 00:05:32,255
Do not be afraid, Mary.

88
00:05:32,365 --> 00:05:34,663
You have been chosen of God.

89
00:05:34,734 --> 00:05:37,259
You will conceive and bring forth a son.

90
00:05:37,337 --> 00:05:40,704
And will name him, Jesus.

91
00:05:40,807 --> 00:05:43,970
He will be great and
will be called the son of

92
00:05:44,043 --> 00:05:47,206
the highest and of his
kingdom there will be no end.

93
00:05:49,382 --> 00:05:51,748
But... how can this be?

94
00:05:51,851 --> 00:05:54,012
I have never been with a man.

95
00:05:54,854 --> 00:05:58,950
The Holy Spirit will come upon you and
the Holy One born will be called...

96
00:06:00,193 --> 00:06:01,160
...the Son of God!

97
00:06:02,995 --> 00:06:05,930
True to the prophecy the child was born.

98
00:06:07,033 --> 00:06:10,935
And Joseph, a carpenter
by trade, and a good man,

99
00:06:11,003 --> 00:06:14,803
was chosen of God to be their protector.

100
00:06:15,975 --> 00:06:21,174
But there were those that hated
the child and sought him harm.

101
00:06:22,048 --> 00:06:23,811
Auuughhhh!

102
00:06:28,955 --> 00:06:29,944
Mary... quickly!

103
00:06:30,022 --> 00:06:30,989
We must go!

104
00:06:31,991 --> 00:06:32,958
Joseph?

105
00:06:35,294 --> 00:06:37,922
Shhhhh...

106
00:06:37,997 --> 00:06:39,828
What is it? What are you doing?

107
00:06:40,333 --> 00:06:41,163
The baby!

108
00:06:44,137 --> 00:06:45,399
He is in danger!

109
00:06:49,208 --> 00:06:50,402
But they are only children!

110
00:06:50,476 --> 00:06:52,137
And should that matter?

111
00:06:53,246 --> 00:06:54,338
I am the king of Israel!

112
00:06:54,447 --> 00:06:55,880
I am the king of the Jews!

113
00:06:55,982 --> 00:06:58,815
I will not share my
kingdom with anyone else.

114
00:06:58,885 --> 00:07:00,113
B- but... it is only a prophecy!

115
00:07:00,186 --> 00:07:02,120
Perhaps it is wrong.

116
00:07:06,926 --> 00:07:08,325
What does it say?

117
00:07:08,394 --> 00:07:09,952
But you, Bethlehem...

118
00:07:10,062 --> 00:07:13,361
Though you are little among
the thousands of Judah,

119
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:16,732
Yet out of you shall come forth to Me

120
00:07:16,836 --> 00:07:20,033
The One to be Ruler in Israel.

121
00:07:21,507 --> 00:07:22,269
Auughhh!

122
00:07:24,076 --> 00:07:24,838
LOOK!

123
00:07:24,911 --> 00:07:28,039
That star over Bethlehem
that those astronomers

124
00:07:28,114 --> 00:07:31,242
said is announcing the birth
of the king of the Jews!

125
00:07:31,317 --> 00:07:34,013
I will NOT take any chances!

126
00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:38,248
I AM THE KING OF THE JEWS!

127
00:07:38,324 --> 00:07:41,259
I WILL NOT SHARE MY THRONE WITH ANYONE!

128
00:07:41,327 --> 00:07:42,885
DO YOU HEAR ME...

129
00:07:42,995 --> 00:07:44,326
NOT WITH ANYONE!

130
00:07:57,543 --> 00:08:00,307
Shhhh...

131
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:02,805
My little one... my little Jesus.

132
00:08:04,116 --> 00:08:04,946
Quickly...

133
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:22,157
Kill every male child
under two years old!

134
00:08:22,235 --> 00:08:23,793
Do not spare one!

135
00:08:35,147 --> 00:08:37,843
That one"

136
00:08:45,892 --> 00:08:51,455
The family fled to Egypt and remained
there until the death of King Herod.

137
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:51,831
Afterwards, they returned to Israel,

138
00:08:51,831 --> 00:08:54,322
Afterwards, they returned to Israel,

139
00:08:54,400 --> 00:09:00,134
where Jesus remained in his parents'
household until he was 30 years old.

140
00:09:01,207 --> 00:09:05,075
But who does he claim to
be, this John the Baptist?

141
00:09:05,444 --> 00:09:09,073
Precisely what we need to find out
and report back to the high priest!

142
00:09:09,148 --> 00:09:12,515
All these ignorant fools,
flocking to this man!

143
00:09:12,618 --> 00:09:13,482
Look at them!

144
00:09:13,586 --> 00:09:15,053
They should be at the temple...

145
00:09:15,154 --> 00:09:17,520
not out here with the
likes of this lunatic!

146
00:09:19,058 --> 00:09:23,995
Repent for the kingdom
of heaven is near.

147
00:09:24,997 --> 00:09:27,363
Prepare the way of the Lord!

148
00:09:31,270 --> 00:09:33,033
Look! There they are again, Andrew.

149
00:09:33,139 --> 00:09:35,164
To ask the same questions no doubt!

150
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:37,205
Help us!

151
00:09:37,276 --> 00:09:39,369
What shall we do to be saved?

152
00:09:42,448 --> 00:09:43,278
Repent!

153
00:09:43,349 --> 00:09:47,877
If it is salvation you seek
then do as Scripture tells you:

154
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:51,353
Prepare the way of the Lord!

155
00:09:51,424 --> 00:09:53,619
Make his paths straight!

156
00:09:53,893 --> 00:09:55,383
What should you do to be saved?

157
00:09:55,461 --> 00:09:58,555
Follow the laws of Moses that is what.

158
00:09:58,631 --> 00:10:00,189
You vipers!

159
00:10:00,299 --> 00:10:01,231
Us?

160
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:02,232
Repent!

161
00:10:03,302 --> 00:10:04,963
You refer to US?

162
00:10:05,037 --> 00:10:06,402
Repentance?

163
00:10:06,472 --> 00:10:12,570
We who keep the law of Moses more
carefully than the likes of all of you!

164
00:10:12,678 --> 00:10:14,578
REPENTANCE FROM WHAT?

165
00:10:14,647 --> 00:10:17,616
You think you are acceptable to God

166
00:10:17,683 --> 00:10:20,880
just because you have
Abraham for your father...

167
00:10:20,953 --> 00:10:22,580
but I tell you...

168
00:10:22,688 --> 00:10:25,555
God is able from these...

169
00:10:26,025 --> 00:10:29,461
stones to raise up children to himself!

170
00:10:29,528 --> 00:10:31,291
Enough!

171
00:10:31,364 --> 00:10:32,388
Tell us plainly!

172
00:10:32,465 --> 00:10:34,126
Do you claim to be the Christ?

173
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:35,189
The Messiah?

174
00:10:35,267 --> 00:10:37,963
The one God will send to save us?

175
00:10:38,270 --> 00:10:41,262
I am the voice of one
crying in the wilderness...

176
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:44,241
"Prepare the way of the Lord!"

177
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:47,473
I baptize you with water...

178
00:10:47,546 --> 00:10:51,676
but he that comes after
me is mightier than I...

179
00:10:52,018 --> 00:10:57,388
whose shoes I am not
even worthy to untie!

180
00:10:58,557 --> 00:11:02,653
I baptize with water but
he will baptize with...

181
00:11:07,633 --> 00:11:09,066
the Holy Spirit...

182
00:11:09,135 --> 00:11:11,126
and with FIRE!

183
00:11:12,171 --> 00:11:12,967
We've heard enough!

184
00:11:13,606 --> 00:11:14,630
Plenty in fact!

185
00:11:17,443 --> 00:11:19,001
You come to me, Jesus?

186
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:25,307
No, lt is I that should
be baptized by you.

187
00:11:26,485 --> 00:11:29,511
Yet it is God's will that
we are here to fulfill...

188
00:11:29,588 --> 00:11:31,112
Not our own.

189
00:11:55,314 --> 00:11:58,283
This is my beloved son!

190
00:12:12,598 --> 00:12:19,128
After His baptism, Jesus went into
the desert by Himself to pray and fast.

191
00:12:19,205 --> 00:12:24,370
His body became weak after going
without food for forty days,

192
00:12:24,443 --> 00:12:27,708
but His spirit remained strong!

193
00:12:31,183 --> 00:12:32,081
Jesus...

194
00:12:34,453 --> 00:12:36,683
Oh Jesus...

195
00:12:39,525 --> 00:12:41,584
40 days of fasting...

196
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:43,150
Impressive!

197
00:12:44,764 --> 00:12:45,662
Look...

198
00:12:48,367 --> 00:12:49,527
Appetizing?

199
00:12:56,075 --> 00:13:02,241
If you are truly the son of God
turn these stones into bread.

200
00:13:03,482 --> 00:13:04,813
Satisfy yourself.

201
00:13:05,084 --> 00:13:08,679
It'll take away that
hunger in your stomach...

202
00:13:10,723 --> 00:13:12,156
Satisfy yourself...

203
00:13:17,496 --> 00:13:21,193
lt is written; Man will
not live by bread alone...

204
00:13:21,267 --> 00:13:24,532
but by every word
that proceeds from God.

205
00:13:26,205 --> 00:13:27,263
Foolish!

206
00:13:32,111 --> 00:13:33,703
Then, prove yourself!

207
00:13:34,780 --> 00:13:35,678
Throw yourself down!

208
00:13:37,583 --> 00:13:41,144
See if God will keep you.

209
00:13:42,188 --> 00:13:43,177
ls it not also written:

210
00:13:43,255 --> 00:13:45,858
He will give his angels
charge over you and

211
00:13:45,858 --> 00:13:48,588
in their hands they
will bear you up... lest

212
00:13:49,361 --> 00:13:50,453
lt is also written:

213
00:13:50,529 --> 00:13:54,465
You will NOT tempt the Lord your God!

214
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:02,568
All this is for you...

215
00:14:02,675 --> 00:14:05,405
and all that is within them.

216
00:14:08,347 --> 00:14:10,838
If you fall down and...

217
00:14:12,351 --> 00:14:13,283
WORSHIP ME.

218
00:14:15,588 --> 00:14:16,418
Think of it...

219
00:14:17,590 --> 00:14:18,818
I will give you armies.

220
00:14:20,392 --> 00:14:21,825
King Jesus!

221
00:14:21,894 --> 00:14:23,327
NO!

222
00:14:24,930 --> 00:14:25,828
AWAY WITH YOU SATAN!

223
00:14:37,943 --> 00:14:39,570
I will worship the Lord my God...

224
00:14:40,746 --> 00:14:42,509
and Him only will I serve.

225
00:15:04,403 --> 00:15:05,165
Hurry up!

226
00:15:05,237 --> 00:15:05,931
Get those nets out!

227
00:15:06,238 --> 00:15:08,229
Complete waste of time!

228
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:09,830
All night at sea!

229
00:15:10,676 --> 00:15:11,802
ALL NIGHT!

230
00:15:14,346 --> 00:15:15,370
And what do we have to show for it?

231
00:15:15,447 --> 00:15:17,847
Well, a temper it seems!

232
00:15:17,950 --> 00:15:19,178
Cheer up Simon.

233
00:15:19,251 --> 00:15:21,344
You'll be off to your bed soon!

234
00:15:21,453 --> 00:15:23,478
Only if the tax collectors
haven't taken it while I was away!

235
00:15:23,656 --> 00:15:24,588
Ha! Ha! Ha!

236
00:15:25,224 --> 00:15:26,919
Simon! James!

237
00:15:27,559 --> 00:15:30,858
And if that weren't enough those
brothers of ours, nowhere in sight.

238
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:32,454
James! Simon!

239
00:15:32,531 --> 00:15:33,589
You're not going to believe this!

240
00:15:33,666 --> 00:15:37,363
Well it's a fine time to show up.

241
00:15:37,469 --> 00:15:39,596
We've a business to run, little brother!

242
00:15:40,406 --> 00:15:40,895
I know James but...

243
00:15:41,006 --> 00:15:42,268
there's a good reason we're late!

244
00:15:43,242 --> 00:15:43,936
There'd better be!

245
00:15:44,009 --> 00:15:44,907
We found him..

246
00:15:45,711 --> 00:15:46,439
Found who?

247
00:15:46,578 --> 00:15:47,510
The messiah!

248
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:48,937
Ha, ha, ha...

249
00:15:49,014 --> 00:15:50,481
The messiah!? Ha!

250
00:15:55,788 --> 00:15:56,550
The Baptist...

251
00:15:56,622 --> 00:15:57,987
he... he told us to follow him.

252
00:15:58,257 --> 00:15:59,224
And so we did...

253
00:15:59,291 --> 00:16:00,223
we've been talking with him.

254
00:16:00,292 --> 00:16:01,224
Yes!

255
00:16:01,293 --> 00:16:02,225
All night.

256
00:16:02,294 --> 00:16:02,988
All night?

257
00:16:03,896 --> 00:16:04,760
Here it comes!

258
00:16:04,830 --> 00:16:05,990
All night?

259
00:16:08,334 --> 00:16:10,359
We've got a business
to run and you two have

260
00:16:10,436 --> 00:16:12,461
nothing better to do
than waste your time on...

261
00:16:14,506 --> 00:16:15,598
And who are you?

262
00:16:19,378 --> 00:16:20,811
Who - are - you?

263
00:16:20,879 --> 00:16:22,312
Jesus.

264
00:16:23,015 --> 00:16:23,777
This is he...

265
00:16:23,849 --> 00:16:24,747
this is the one Simon.

266
00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:28,446
The messiah! Jesus... of Nazareth!

267
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:30,511
Calm down, Simon.

268
00:16:32,558 --> 00:16:33,650
The Messiah?

269
00:16:36,328 --> 00:16:38,319
The Messiah we have been waiting for...

270
00:16:40,499 --> 00:16:42,660
a poor man from Nazareth?

271
00:16:45,838 --> 00:16:46,668
It's true Simon!

272
00:16:58,917 --> 00:17:00,009
Take the boat out again.

273
00:17:00,085 --> 00:17:00,915
What?

274
00:17:00,986 --> 00:17:01,816
Why?

275
00:17:01,887 --> 00:17:03,582
You want a catch, don't you?

276
00:17:03,655 --> 00:17:04,587
I'm not about to...

277
00:17:07,993 --> 00:17:08,960
We were fishing all night.

278
00:17:10,095 --> 00:17:11,528
We've caught nothing. I...

279
00:17:19,872 --> 00:17:21,464
Come on, Simon... James!

280
00:17:21,573 --> 00:17:23,040
What have you got to lose?

281
00:17:23,108 --> 00:17:24,575
You've been up all night already.

282
00:17:24,643 --> 00:17:25,610
Come on...

283
00:17:25,744 --> 00:17:27,336
Let's see what this is all about!

284
00:17:28,614 --> 00:17:29,376
Alright.

285
00:17:29,448 --> 00:17:31,882
Just to get this nonsense
out of your heads!

286
00:17:34,586 --> 00:17:36,383
But it'll be you two doing
all the work next week!

287
00:17:54,073 --> 00:17:55,097
Lower the nets here!

288
00:18:02,047 --> 00:18:03,537
This is a waste of time!

289
00:18:03,615 --> 00:18:05,515
A complete waste!

290
00:18:06,652 --> 00:18:07,516
Wake me up when...

291
00:18:15,494 --> 00:18:16,392
Simon...

292
00:18:20,966 --> 00:18:21,728
Simon!

293
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:24,769
Look... come and look.

294
00:18:30,008 --> 00:18:30,565
Ha ha!

295
00:18:30,642 --> 00:18:33,008
Well, come on! Help us!

296
00:18:33,078 --> 00:18:35,672
There are too many of them!

297
00:18:38,650 --> 00:18:39,548
The nets are breaking!

298
00:18:39,618 --> 00:18:40,482
Call the other boat.

299
00:18:41,186 --> 00:18:41,743
The boat!

300
00:18:41,854 --> 00:18:42,878
Bring the other boat!

301
00:18:45,424 --> 00:18:45,651
Lord!

302
00:18:46,558 --> 00:18:47,456
LORD!

303
00:19:03,675 --> 00:19:04,539
It's a miracle!

304
00:19:04,610 --> 00:19:05,770
A miracle!

305
00:19:05,844 --> 00:19:06,970
Ha! Ha!

306
00:19:11,083 --> 00:19:12,141
Incredible!

307
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:16,788
This is the largest
catch we've ever had!

308
00:19:16,855 --> 00:19:18,152
And the biggest sale!

309
00:19:18,223 --> 00:19:19,713
That's 2 shekels!

310
00:19:19,791 --> 00:19:21,782
And that's 3 shekels.

311
00:19:27,533 --> 00:19:27,897
Rabbi...

312
00:19:29,034 --> 00:19:29,728
Please...

313
00:19:30,836 --> 00:19:31,666
depart from me...

314
00:19:32,671 --> 00:19:34,571
I... I am a sinful man!

315
00:19:35,807 --> 00:19:37,468
Don't be afraid, Simon Peter.

316
00:19:39,912 --> 00:19:40,776
Follow me...

317
00:19:42,848 --> 00:19:43,542
What do you mean?

318
00:19:44,249 --> 00:19:45,079
Follow me, Peter...

319
00:19:47,219 --> 00:19:47,878
All of you.

320
00:19:47,953 --> 00:19:51,013
Follow me and I will
make you fishers of men!

321
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:56,157
You mean... now?

322
00:19:57,162 --> 00:19:57,924
Yes, Peter.

323
00:19:59,765 --> 00:20:02,461
But this is the biggest
catch we've ever had!

324
00:20:03,936 --> 00:20:04,698
From now on...

325
00:20:04,770 --> 00:20:06,032
you shall catch men!

326
00:20:36,201 --> 00:20:37,896
This is going to be
very bad for business...

327
00:20:39,037 --> 00:20:39,901
very bad.

328
00:20:43,208 --> 00:20:43,970
Wait!

329
00:20:45,077 --> 00:20:45,907
Wait for me!

330
00:21:01,693 --> 00:21:02,990
ls this Simon's house?

331
00:21:03,095 --> 00:21:05,757
ls this were Jesus of
Nazareth is staying?

332
00:21:05,831 --> 00:21:06,729
Yes yes!

333
00:21:06,798 --> 00:21:08,095
But there is hardly any room!

334
00:21:08,166 --> 00:21:11,624
I heard about a miracle;
a large catch of fish.

335
00:21:11,703 --> 00:21:13,068
Water turned to wine?

336
00:21:13,205 --> 00:21:14,263
Yes, yes!

337
00:21:14,339 --> 00:21:15,567
I heard that too!

338
00:21:15,641 --> 00:21:18,633
And that he healed a young
man possessed by demons?

339
00:21:19,678 --> 00:21:20,235
It's true!

340
00:21:20,312 --> 00:21:21,574
lt was a miracle!

341
00:21:21,647 --> 00:21:22,136
I was there!

342
00:21:22,214 --> 00:21:24,079
I saw it with my own eyes!

343
00:21:24,182 --> 00:21:27,151
And I hear he's healed
Simon's mother in law...

344
00:21:27,219 --> 00:21:28,277
Sick as can be...

345
00:21:28,353 --> 00:21:31,049
the poor woman was bedridden, and now...

346
00:21:32,057 --> 00:21:33,786
Well look for yourself if you can!

347
00:21:33,859 --> 00:21:35,656
She's in there attending to others!

348
00:21:39,898 --> 00:21:42,560
Ask and it will be given to you;

349
00:21:43,902 --> 00:21:46,268
seek and you will find;

350
00:21:47,706 --> 00:21:50,732
knock and the door
will be opened to you.

351
00:21:51,943 --> 00:21:54,036
For everyone who asks receives;

352
00:21:55,213 --> 00:21:56,805
he who seeks finds;

353
00:21:57,716 --> 00:21:58,683
and to him who knocks,

354
00:21:58,817 --> 00:22:00,944
the door will be opened.

355
00:22:02,154 --> 00:22:03,917
Just that... ask?

356
00:22:03,989 --> 00:22:05,013
Yes!

357
00:22:05,090 --> 00:22:07,752
Just ask and you will receive!

358
00:22:09,127 --> 00:22:09,718
Oh no!

359
00:22:11,163 --> 00:22:13,654
No! What are you doing?

360
00:22:13,732 --> 00:22:14,994
The roof!

361
00:22:15,067 --> 00:22:16,659
You've ruined my roof!

362
00:22:16,735 --> 00:22:17,827
Please, please help me!

363
00:22:17,936 --> 00:22:19,836
Please, help me.

364
00:22:23,008 --> 00:22:24,305
Please, help me!

365
00:22:34,286 --> 00:22:36,652
Please, I have been this way for years.

366
00:22:36,755 --> 00:22:38,313
Please help me!

367
00:22:38,390 --> 00:22:39,220
Rabbi!

368
00:22:39,358 --> 00:22:41,121
Rabbi... we've heard
you can do miracles!

369
00:22:42,327 --> 00:22:44,318
If there is anything
you can do for him...

370
00:22:44,396 --> 00:22:45,761
Anything!

371
00:22:47,265 --> 00:22:50,132
Now, now... what can the good rabbi do?

372
00:22:50,202 --> 00:22:51,692
Take the man home!

373
00:22:52,704 --> 00:22:53,329
Please, Rabbi.

374
00:22:53,672 --> 00:22:56,766
I know God hears you.

375
00:22:56,842 --> 00:22:58,275
Rabbi... please!

376
00:23:05,384 --> 00:23:07,318
It's alright.

377
00:23:07,386 --> 00:23:08,853
Your sins...

378
00:23:11,423 --> 00:23:12,390
are forgiven.

379
00:23:15,794 --> 00:23:16,828
What did he say?

380
00:23:16,828 --> 00:23:17,795
What did he mean?

381
00:23:19,831 --> 00:23:21,196
His sins are forgiven?

382
00:23:21,266 --> 00:23:21,789
But how?

383
00:23:22,434 --> 00:23:24,061
That is blasphemy!

384
00:23:24,136 --> 00:23:26,161
Only God can forgive sins!

385
00:23:26,238 --> 00:23:27,671
Blasphemy!

386
00:23:27,739 --> 00:23:28,933
BLASPHEMY!

387
00:23:33,278 --> 00:23:35,678
Tell me! Which is easier to say?

388
00:23:35,747 --> 00:23:37,908
"Your sins are forgiven" or...

389
00:23:41,019 --> 00:23:42,145
get up and walk?"

390
00:23:43,054 --> 00:23:47,150
To show you that I have also been
given power to forgive sins...

391
00:23:48,827 --> 00:23:49,691
Arise...

392
00:23:50,729 --> 00:23:51,320
take up your bed...

393
00:23:52,130 --> 00:23:52,824
and walk!

394
00:24:27,199 --> 00:24:27,927
Thank you, Lord!

395
00:24:28,533 --> 00:24:29,500
Thank you! Thank you!

396
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:37,404
It's a miracle! A miracle!

397
00:24:37,476 --> 00:24:39,944
I tell you He is a blasphemer!

398
00:24:40,512 --> 00:24:41,444
He is a blasphemer.

399
00:24:42,314 --> 00:24:43,372
But you saw it.

400
00:24:43,448 --> 00:24:44,472
You were there!

401
00:24:44,783 --> 00:24:46,250
He healed a paralytic!

402
00:24:46,318 --> 00:24:48,479
That has nothing to do with it!

403
00:24:49,321 --> 00:24:51,016
Healing a man is one thing!

404
00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:55,050
BUT NO ONE CAN FORGIVE SINS BUT GOD!

405
00:25:08,006 --> 00:25:08,938
The time has come!

406
00:25:09,007 --> 00:25:11,100
The kingdom of Heaven is here!

407
00:25:12,010 --> 00:25:16,106
Come and believe the good news
of the forgiveness of sins...

408
00:25:17,349 --> 00:25:19,283
available to every one of you!

409
00:25:20,318 --> 00:25:22,513
Available to all!

410
00:25:32,531 --> 00:25:34,055
Come, come!
I haven't got all day!

411
00:25:34,132 --> 00:25:36,498
But that is all we can afford!

412
00:25:36,568 --> 00:25:37,557
Surely you...

413
00:25:37,836 --> 00:25:38,803
No I cannot!

414
00:25:38,870 --> 00:25:39,962
Whatever it is you are suggesting...

415
00:25:40,038 --> 00:25:41,130
I CANNOT!

416
00:25:42,374 --> 00:25:43,068
Now get out of here.

417
00:25:43,141 --> 00:25:44,165
But it's true!

418
00:25:45,143 --> 00:25:45,939
NOW!

419
00:25:47,879 --> 00:25:48,311
Splendid!

420
00:25:54,853 --> 00:25:55,148
That is...

421
00:26:00,892 --> 00:26:01,517
uh...

422
00:26:01,593 --> 00:26:03,390
that is mine.

423
00:26:07,966 --> 00:26:10,230
That's Matthew the tax collector.

424
00:26:10,335 --> 00:26:12,030
Collecting for the Romans.

425
00:26:12,103 --> 00:26:15,436
...and no doubt a little for himself.

426
00:26:25,050 --> 00:26:26,950
People don't seem to like you.

427
00:26:28,153 --> 00:26:29,211
Hmph! Some don't.

428
00:26:29,287 --> 00:26:31,380
But others don't seem to mind.

429
00:26:31,456 --> 00:26:32,582
Certainly not!

430
00:26:32,891 --> 00:26:34,415
Hey Matthew...

431
00:26:34,492 --> 00:26:36,289
How about a little more wine?

432
00:26:36,361 --> 00:26:38,022
You've had plenty!

433
00:26:40,966 --> 00:26:41,432
Come, Lord!

434
00:26:41,499 --> 00:26:43,262
Do not associate with him.

435
00:26:43,335 --> 00:26:45,064
People will talk.
You must...

436
00:26:45,136 --> 00:26:46,330
Wait a minute!

437
00:26:46,404 --> 00:26:49,896
You're that new prophet every
one's talking about, aren't you?

438
00:26:51,343 --> 00:26:52,970
Jesus of Nazareth.

439
00:26:53,044 --> 00:26:54,238
Don't touch him.

440
00:26:54,312 --> 00:26:55,472
What's it to you?

441
00:26:56,514 --> 00:26:57,378
Maybe he wouldn't mind.

442
00:27:04,389 --> 00:27:05,515
I know who you are.

443
00:27:05,590 --> 00:27:07,114
I saw how you healed that man...

444
00:27:07,192 --> 00:27:11,424
What you said about forgiveness of sins.

445
00:27:15,266 --> 00:27:16,460
I... I believe you are sent of God.

446
00:27:16,534 --> 00:27:18,297
Then follow me.

447
00:27:25,110 --> 00:27:27,101
Matthew?
Follow a holy man?

448
00:27:29,547 --> 00:27:30,309
They're right, Rabbi...

449
00:27:31,549 --> 00:27:32,447
I haven't been...

450
00:27:35,053 --> 00:27:36,111
I am not a good man.

451
00:27:36,721 --> 00:27:38,245
I didn't ask if you were.

452
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:44,926
Come, Matthew.
Follow me!

453
00:28:05,583 --> 00:28:06,572
What do you make of this?

454
00:28:06,651 --> 00:28:08,642
Don't you remember, Simon?

455
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:13,384
Jesus cast that net over the boats
and our catch was overflowing.

456
00:28:14,225 --> 00:28:15,988
Then he said we would be fishers...

457
00:28:16,061 --> 00:28:17,119
of men.

458
00:28:18,363 --> 00:28:18,954
Yes...

459
00:28:19,030 --> 00:28:19,655
of men like you...

460
00:28:19,731 --> 00:28:20,527
and me...

461
00:28:20,665 --> 00:28:21,529
fishermen...

462
00:28:21,633 --> 00:28:22,964
and tax collectors.

463
00:28:23,034 --> 00:28:23,693
Everyone!

464
00:28:23,768 --> 00:28:26,396
Things will never be the same Simon.

465
00:28:27,238 --> 00:28:28,262
Things will never be the same.

466
00:28:37,182 --> 00:28:41,676
Jesus continued to surprise people
by healing the sick and the lame.

467
00:28:41,753 --> 00:28:45,689
This was a fulfillment
of the prophecy that said,

468
00:28:45,757 --> 00:28:50,160
the Spirit of the Lord
is upon Me because He has

469
00:28:50,228 --> 00:28:54,392
anointed Me to proclaim
the good news to the poor.

470
00:28:55,667 --> 00:28:58,397
He has sent me to
heal the brokenhearted,

471
00:28:58,470 --> 00:29:01,166
to proclaim liberty for the prisoners,

472
00:29:01,239 --> 00:29:04,037
and recovery of sight to the blind,

473
00:29:05,043 --> 00:29:06,635
to set the oppressed free

474
00:29:06,711 --> 00:29:10,772
and to proclaim the
acceptable year of the Lord!'

475
00:29:16,221 --> 00:29:17,711
Help me! I'm blind!

476
00:29:17,822 --> 00:29:20,484
Help me... please!

477
00:29:21,459 --> 00:29:22,153
What?

478
00:29:22,227 --> 00:29:25,025
What are you doing?

479
00:29:32,370 --> 00:29:33,302
Oh, I...

480
00:29:34,339 --> 00:29:35,135
I can see...

481
00:29:35,306 --> 00:29:37,672
I can see...

482
00:29:37,776 --> 00:29:38,765
What?

483
00:29:38,843 --> 00:29:41,038
I CAN SEE!

484
00:29:54,225 --> 00:29:55,556
I tell you he's a troublemaker!

485
00:29:55,660 --> 00:29:56,490
A nuisance!

486
00:29:57,295 --> 00:29:57,784
I agree!

487
00:29:57,862 --> 00:30:01,161
Publicans, tax collectors...

488
00:30:01,232 --> 00:30:02,494
prostitutes...

489
00:30:03,234 --> 00:30:05,361
Saying he can forgive sins!

490
00:30:05,436 --> 00:30:06,494
Blasphemy!

491
00:30:06,604 --> 00:30:08,094
That's what it is!

492
00:30:08,173 --> 00:30:10,698
Then what are we waiting for?

493
00:30:10,775 --> 00:30:14,142
We are the keepers of the laws of Moses!

494
00:30:14,212 --> 00:30:17,375
lt is our responsibility to stop this.

495
00:30:17,448 --> 00:30:19,279
We must take action!

496
00:30:24,355 --> 00:30:26,084
Yet... you have seen his works...

497
00:30:26,157 --> 00:30:27,681
the healing of the sick...

498
00:30:27,759 --> 00:30:29,693
even the raising of the dead!

499
00:30:29,761 --> 00:30:30,853
Oh please!

500
00:30:31,129 --> 00:30:33,427
A sick boy gets well and suddenly...

501
00:30:33,498 --> 00:30:35,796
you have the dead raised to life!

502
00:30:35,867 --> 00:30:37,459
People talk!

503
00:30:37,535 --> 00:30:38,331
Rumors grow!

504
00:30:38,870 --> 00:30:42,533
But just today a blind
man regained his sight!

505
00:30:42,607 --> 00:30:44,438
Here, in the very temple.

506
00:30:44,509 --> 00:30:45,669
Or so they say.

507
00:30:46,578 --> 00:30:50,639
How do we know that these
so-called "miracles" are real?

508
00:30:50,715 --> 00:30:51,841
Well...

509
00:30:55,854 --> 00:30:56,650
Master Nicodemus.

510
00:30:56,721 --> 00:30:58,279
This is the man.

511
00:30:58,356 --> 00:30:59,653
It's a miracle.

512
00:30:59,724 --> 00:31:02,215
It's a miracle I tell you a-

513
00:31:02,293 --> 00:31:05,558
What is the meaning of
bringing these people here?

514
00:31:05,630 --> 00:31:08,394
Indulge me a moment... please.

515
00:31:10,401 --> 00:31:12,426
Tell me. ls he your son?

516
00:31:13,605 --> 00:31:15,266
Yes... yes.

517
00:31:15,340 --> 00:31:18,366
And was he... born blind?

518
00:31:18,443 --> 00:31:19,842
Completely...

519
00:31:23,314 --> 00:31:25,179
How then is it that he sees now?

520
00:31:26,317 --> 00:31:28,308
We... we don't know.

521
00:31:29,487 --> 00:31:30,283
He is of age...

522
00:31:30,355 --> 00:31:33,290
perhaps you should ask him.

523
00:31:36,361 --> 00:31:37,885
What have you got to say for yourself?

524
00:31:38,863 --> 00:31:40,888
I... I can see! I can see...

525
00:31:41,199 --> 00:31:42,530
A man... a prophet...

526
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:44,227
he healed me! He...

527
00:31:44,302 --> 00:31:44,927
Back away!

528
00:31:45,203 --> 00:31:49,697
If you can see, it has
been a work of God...

529
00:31:49,774 --> 00:31:51,742
not this man you talk about...

530
00:31:51,809 --> 00:31:53,709
one we know to be a sinner.

531
00:31:53,778 --> 00:31:54,836
A sinner?

532
00:31:54,946 --> 00:31:59,645
Whether he is a sinner
or not I don't know...

533
00:31:59,717 --> 00:32:00,877
All I know is...

534
00:32:00,952 --> 00:32:03,853
I was blind and now...

535
00:32:03,922 --> 00:32:06,220
now I can see!

536
00:32:06,291 --> 00:32:07,690
But how?

537
00:32:07,759 --> 00:32:09,454
How did he do it?

538
00:32:09,527 --> 00:32:10,619
I don't know! I...

539
00:32:10,728 --> 00:32:14,255
but I am sure we can find him.

540
00:32:15,566 --> 00:32:16,965
Do you also want to be his disciples?

541
00:32:17,869 --> 00:32:18,460
Out!

542
00:32:22,907 --> 00:32:23,703
AuughhhhH!

543
00:32:23,808 --> 00:32:27,938
You may be his disciple but we are not!

544
00:32:28,012 --> 00:32:29,502
We follow Moses!

545
00:32:29,580 --> 00:32:30,842
As for this man...

546
00:32:30,915 --> 00:32:33,440
we don't even know where he comes from!

547
00:32:33,518 --> 00:32:35,713
Well... isn't that something?

548
00:32:36,487 --> 00:32:37,317
You don't know who he is!

549
00:32:38,389 --> 00:32:41,790
When was the last time you heard
of a blind man receiving his sight?

550
00:32:42,026 --> 00:32:45,257
I tell you, this man healed me!

551
00:32:45,330 --> 00:32:48,629
If he were not from
God, he could do nothing!

552
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:51,430
You were cursed with blindness...

553
00:32:51,502 --> 00:32:53,299
and you dare teach us?

554
00:32:53,404 --> 00:32:55,463
OUT! Get him out of the temple!

555
00:32:55,540 --> 00:32:56,234
OUT!

556
00:32:56,307 --> 00:32:57,638
I can see...

557
00:32:57,742 --> 00:32:59,835
It's a miracle!

558
00:32:59,944 --> 00:33:01,571
I can see the sky...

559
00:33:01,713 --> 00:33:02,975
and I can see the clouds...

560
00:33:03,047 --> 00:33:05,242
and look, are those birds...

561
00:33:05,316 --> 00:33:09,912
I can see! I can see!

562
00:33:11,022 --> 00:33:11,852
Auughhhhh!

563
00:33:23,501 --> 00:33:24,468
Has he been there all night?

564
00:33:29,674 --> 00:33:31,505
Yes... praying.

565
00:33:34,879 --> 00:33:36,005
Do you miss it?

566
00:33:36,347 --> 00:33:37,336
What.

567
00:33:37,448 --> 00:33:38,415
The boat...

568
00:33:39,584 --> 00:33:40,448
Galilee...

569
00:33:40,518 --> 00:33:41,348
Sometimes...

570
00:33:44,355 --> 00:33:44,844
my family.

571
00:33:48,559 --> 00:33:50,026
But not my wife's cooking.

572
00:33:50,094 --> 00:33:53,928
That I don't really miss!

573
00:33:57,568 --> 00:34:00,366
But the boat...
yes I miss that.

574
00:34:00,438 --> 00:34:03,532
The freedom, open sea...

575
00:34:03,608 --> 00:34:08,068
Then the more you'll
appreciate it when we get back.

576
00:34:14,886 --> 00:34:15,818
We're not going back.

577
00:34:18,990 --> 00:34:19,957
We all know...

578
00:34:20,058 --> 00:34:21,525
it will never be the same.

579
00:34:22,827 --> 00:34:23,919
We will not go back...

580
00:34:24,762 --> 00:34:26,559
this is God's doing.

581
00:34:32,103 --> 00:34:33,695
I am sending you on a journey.

582
00:34:34,605 --> 00:34:37,597
You twelve... two by two.

583
00:34:38,042 --> 00:34:40,977
To share the good news
of the kingdom of God.

584
00:34:42,513 --> 00:34:43,571
And as you go, tell everyone,

585
00:34:43,648 --> 00:34:46,845
"The Kingdom of heaven is at hand!"

586
00:34:48,653 --> 00:34:51,918
Lord... we have left
everything to follow you.

587
00:34:52,957 --> 00:34:54,049
Yes, Peter you have.

588
00:34:55,393 --> 00:34:56,018
You all have.

589
00:34:57,095 --> 00:35:00,826
And he who has left
houses or brothers or

590
00:35:00,898 --> 00:35:04,595
sisters or father or mother
or wife or children or

591
00:35:04,702 --> 00:35:09,469
lands for my sake and the Gospels'
will receive 100 times more...

592
00:35:09,607 --> 00:35:15,944
with persecution, and in
the end, everlasting life!

593
00:35:17,815 --> 00:35:24,015
Heal the sick, cleanse the lepers,
raise the dead, cast out demons.

594
00:35:24,088 --> 00:35:27,649
Freely you have received, freely give!

595
00:35:28,659 --> 00:35:30,820
I send you out as sheep among wolves.

596
00:35:31,929 --> 00:35:35,490
Therefore, be wise as
serpents and harmless

597
00:35:35,566 --> 00:35:39,024
as doves for not all will receive you.

598
00:35:39,904 --> 00:35:41,599
Whoever confesses me before men,

599
00:35:42,607 --> 00:35:45,599
him I will also confess
before my Father in heaven.

600
00:35:46,911 --> 00:35:48,469
But whoever denies me before men,

601
00:35:48,613 --> 00:35:52,845
him I will also deny before
my Father who is in heaven.

602
00:35:54,785 --> 00:35:57,151
He who finds his life will lose it,

603
00:35:58,122 --> 00:36:00,454
and he who loses his life for my sake,

604
00:36:01,125 --> 00:36:02,524
will find it.

605
00:36:03,694 --> 00:36:06,060
He who receives you, receives me.

606
00:36:07,131 --> 00:36:08,530
And he who receives me...

607
00:36:09,534 --> 00:36:11,525
receives the Father who sent me.

608
00:36:14,739 --> 00:36:18,903
So we went two by two
to preach His message,

609
00:36:18,976 --> 00:36:21,570
just like He told us to.

610
00:36:21,646 --> 00:36:24,046
And the people received it gladly...

611
00:36:24,949 --> 00:36:27,008
at least most of them did!

612
00:36:32,557 --> 00:36:37,494
Galilee, the Decapolis,
Jerusalem, even across the Jordan!

613
00:36:38,029 --> 00:36:42,989
It's as if the whole world is
following this Jesus of Nazareth!

614
00:36:43,067 --> 00:36:44,625
And you just noticed?

615
00:36:45,770 --> 00:36:48,204
Well...?
What are we going to do?

616
00:36:48,272 --> 00:36:49,466
I'm thinking!

617
00:36:50,208 --> 00:36:52,836
Well we can't very well
sit here doing nothing!

618
00:36:52,944 --> 00:36:53,740
Master Zerah.

619
00:36:53,811 --> 00:36:54,140
What!

620
00:36:54,212 --> 00:36:55,873
WHAT WHAT WHAT?

621
00:36:56,547 --> 00:36:58,913
Can you not see that we are in council?

622
00:37:00,117 --> 00:37:00,947
What is it?

623
00:37:01,085 --> 00:37:02,780
Forgive my interruption but...

624
00:37:03,221 --> 00:37:04,017
a group of people...

625
00:37:04,088 --> 00:37:04,918
they have a woman...

626
00:37:04,989 --> 00:37:05,785
caught in adultery!

627
00:37:05,856 --> 00:37:07,255
The very act they say...

628
00:37:07,525 --> 00:37:08,924
and they have brought her here!

629
00:37:10,027 --> 00:37:11,051
Well... what of it!

630
00:37:11,128 --> 00:37:12,152
You know the law!

631
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:13,629
Tell some of the others!

632
00:37:13,698 --> 00:37:14,630
Stone her!

633
00:37:14,699 --> 00:37:15,563
Very well.

634
00:37:15,633 --> 00:37:19,569
Well... what are we going
to do about this Jesus?

635
00:37:20,071 --> 00:37:22,164
He's taking the people
from under our influence...

636
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:23,571
away from us!

637
00:37:23,641 --> 00:37:25,108
Wait! Come back here!

638
00:37:25,610 --> 00:37:28,078
Where are you going?
This is important!

639
00:37:28,145 --> 00:37:29,169
The adulteress...

640
00:37:29,247 --> 00:37:30,771
bring her with you and come with us!

641
00:37:30,848 --> 00:37:31,940
But what about...

642
00:37:32,016 --> 00:37:33,074
Will you be quiet?

643
00:37:33,951 --> 00:37:35,646
I have an idea! Come!

644
00:37:39,957 --> 00:37:41,925
You will find rest for your souls.

645
00:37:41,993 --> 00:37:43,517
For my yoke is easy...

646
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:51,529
Really?
What is the meaning of this?

647
00:37:52,203 --> 00:37:54,603
Jesus opens the eyes of
the blind does he not?

648
00:37:55,306 --> 00:37:57,536
We too then shall open
the eyes of the blind...

649
00:37:58,209 --> 00:38:00,177
these blind followers of his!

650
00:38:02,213 --> 00:38:03,009
Move!

651
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:03,876
Out of my way!

652
00:38:03,948 --> 00:38:05,540
Out of my way, move!

653
00:38:18,329 --> 00:38:19,819
Rabbi... this woman

654
00:38:19,930 --> 00:38:21,261
was caught in...

655
00:38:22,633 --> 00:38:23,600
Adultery!

656
00:38:23,668 --> 00:38:25,602
ln the very act!

657
00:38:26,270 --> 00:38:29,865
You know that Moses in the law
commanded that such a woman...

658
00:38:29,940 --> 00:38:30,964
should be stoned!

659
00:38:34,345 --> 00:38:35,175
Now Rabbi...

660
00:38:36,814 --> 00:38:37,803
what do you say?

661
00:39:03,074 --> 00:39:09,070
Let him who is without
sin cast the first stone.

662
00:39:30,868 --> 00:39:33,837
Hmmm... come along!

663
00:39:35,773 --> 00:39:39,937
Woman... where are your accusers?

664
00:39:41,412 --> 00:39:43,403
Does no one condemn you?

665
00:39:45,983 --> 00:39:46,915
No one, Lord.

666
00:39:49,253 --> 00:39:51,721
Then I don't condemn you either.

667
00:39:52,890 --> 00:39:55,017
Go... and sin no more.

668
00:40:00,030 --> 00:40:02,362
Thank you.

669
00:40:13,244 --> 00:40:14,336
What do you make of this?

670
00:40:16,213 --> 00:40:17,202
What is there to make of it?

671
00:40:18,115 --> 00:40:18,706
Look at her...

672
00:40:18,849 --> 00:40:21,010
he forgave her of her sins.

673
00:40:21,085 --> 00:40:23,815
Her heart is filled with peace.

674
00:40:24,855 --> 00:40:26,686
She leaves a different woman.

675
00:40:29,393 --> 00:40:32,726
You and I have been
witness to a miracle...

676
00:40:33,864 --> 00:40:35,354
a broken life made whole.

677
00:40:37,101 --> 00:40:38,466
Extraordinary!

678
00:40:40,471 --> 00:40:42,803
I would like to speak
with this man myself.

679
00:41:06,430 --> 00:41:07,328
Master Nicodemus!

680
00:41:08,532 --> 00:41:09,829
I have come to see the Rabbi...

681
00:41:10,534 --> 00:41:11,364
to speak with him.

682
00:41:13,804 --> 00:41:14,293
Rabbi...

683
00:41:16,273 --> 00:41:17,205
Rabbi, I...

684
00:41:18,275 --> 00:41:20,766
I believe you are a teacher sent of God.

685
00:41:20,845 --> 00:41:24,941
For no one could possibly do
the miracles that you are doing,

686
00:41:25,015 --> 00:41:25,879
were it not for God.

687
00:41:27,518 --> 00:41:28,177
I see...

688
00:41:28,252 --> 00:41:31,483
I see the work of God in the
hearts of your followers...

689
00:41:32,356 --> 00:41:33,220
ln you.

690
00:41:34,358 --> 00:41:41,457
The truth is, no one can experience the
Kingdom of God unless he is born again.

691
00:41:41,532 --> 00:41:46,060
But how can one be born
again when he is old?

692
00:41:47,304 --> 00:41:55,439
Flesh gives birth to flesh but the
Spirit gives birth to the spirit.

693
00:41:56,547 --> 00:41:58,879
But how can this be?

694
00:41:59,884 --> 00:42:04,821
You are a teacher of Israel and
do not understand these things?

695
00:42:06,090 --> 00:42:08,285
You must be born again, Nicodemus...

696
00:42:09,560 --> 00:42:10,424
in your heart.

697
00:42:22,540 --> 00:42:24,007
So he was a teacher,

698
00:42:24,074 --> 00:42:25,098
a healer of the sick,

699
00:42:25,209 --> 00:42:27,200
and the sick at heart it seems to me.

700
00:42:28,045 --> 00:42:30,104
Even some of your religious
leaders sought his opinion;

701
00:42:30,180 --> 00:42:32,045
a man of the people.

702
00:42:32,917 --> 00:42:37,115
His fame spread and people came
from all around to hear him.

703
00:42:37,187 --> 00:42:39,052
To fill their hearts...

704
00:42:39,123 --> 00:42:40,556
as well as their stomachs!

705
00:42:42,626 --> 00:42:43,888
He fed them all...

706
00:42:43,961 --> 00:42:49,263
Knowing they were tired after
coming from long distances,

707
00:42:49,333 --> 00:42:56,364
he took two fish and five loaves
of bread and fed over 5,000 people.

708
00:42:56,440 --> 00:42:58,032
Five thousand?

709
00:42:58,142 --> 00:43:01,134
Yes... another time, 3,000.

710
00:43:03,614 --> 00:43:07,948
After that, the people wanted
to crown him King of Israel.

711
00:43:11,889 --> 00:43:14,551
Truly this is the
Prophet that is to come!

712
00:43:14,658 --> 00:43:16,853
Who else could do these miracles!

713
00:43:16,927 --> 00:43:18,895
And speak with such authority!

714
00:43:18,996 --> 00:43:20,156
He is the Messiah!

715
00:43:20,230 --> 00:43:21,322
The King of Israel!

716
00:43:21,398 --> 00:43:23,559
The one we have been waiting for!

717
00:43:23,634 --> 00:43:25,329
Jesus the Messiah!

718
00:43:26,303 --> 00:43:29,602
Some of his own disciples
took up the idea.

719
00:43:29,673 --> 00:43:31,607
The King of Israel!

720
00:43:32,276 --> 00:43:35,245
Lord we must go on to Jerusalem!

721
00:43:36,146 --> 00:43:37,044
Your favor is everywhere!

722
00:43:38,248 --> 00:43:40,648
Yes, we will go to Jerusalem.

723
00:43:42,686 --> 00:43:43,618
Wonderful!

724
00:43:43,687 --> 00:43:47,248
And there I must suffer many things...

725
00:43:55,032 --> 00:43:56,397
I will be rejected by the elders,

726
00:43:56,500 --> 00:43:59,401
the chief priests and
the teachers of the law...

727
00:44:01,238 --> 00:44:02,068
No!

728
00:44:02,139 --> 00:44:03,003
and there...

729
00:44:06,410 --> 00:44:08,071
I must be killed.

730
00:44:08,612 --> 00:44:10,102
No, Lord. NO!

731
00:44:12,282 --> 00:44:15,979
And on the third day I
will be raised to life.

732
00:44:17,721 --> 00:44:21,384
This was not what his
disciples had wanted to hear.

733
00:44:21,458 --> 00:44:24,985
Some thought Jesus
was going to set up an

734
00:44:25,062 --> 00:44:28,463
earthly kingdom but
Jesus had another mission:

735
00:44:29,299 --> 00:44:33,963
Whoever wants to become great
among you must be your servant,

736
00:44:34,672 --> 00:44:38,199
and whoever wants to be
first must be your slave.

737
00:44:38,275 --> 00:44:41,039
Just as I did not come to be served,

738
00:44:41,712 --> 00:44:42,940
but TO serve,

739
00:44:43,013 --> 00:44:46,278
and to give my life
as a ransom for many.

740
00:44:47,251 --> 00:44:48,377
Some were shocked;

741
00:44:48,452 --> 00:44:52,548
others saddened and
still others, offended.

742
00:44:53,323 --> 00:44:58,659
Many things that Jesus taught
became difficult for people to hear.

743
00:44:59,997 --> 00:45:01,328
Love your enemies.

744
00:45:02,199 --> 00:45:04,531
Do good to them that hate you.

745
00:45:05,169 --> 00:45:07,399
I know some of you follow me because you

746
00:45:07,471 --> 00:45:09,701
ate the loaves and
fishes and were filled.

747
00:45:10,708 --> 00:45:13,040
Do not work for the food that perishes,

748
00:45:13,711 --> 00:45:16,680
but for food that
endures to eternal life,

749
00:45:17,448 --> 00:45:18,676
which I will give you.

750
00:45:19,750 --> 00:45:23,015
I am the living bread,
which came down from heaven.

751
00:45:24,121 --> 00:45:28,421
If anyone eats of this
bread, he will live forever;

752
00:45:29,159 --> 00:45:32,720
and the bread that I
shall give is My flesh,

753
00:45:34,131 --> 00:45:36,497
which I shall give for
the life of the world.

754
00:45:37,301 --> 00:45:42,637
Some began to turn away from him
because they wanted an earthly king.

755
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:46,375
They began to reject Jesus' teaching.

756
00:45:46,443 --> 00:45:50,277
And even one of the
twelve, tempted by Satan,

757
00:45:51,081 --> 00:45:53,743
tried to take matters
into his own hands.

758
00:46:33,423 --> 00:46:34,355
lt is settled then...

759
00:46:35,192 --> 00:46:35,556
Settled.

760
00:46:35,626 --> 00:46:37,651
Thirty pieces of silver.

761
00:46:37,761 --> 00:46:40,594
And I shall hand Jesus over to you...

762
00:46:46,470 --> 00:46:47,562
We must be careful.

763
00:46:48,438 --> 00:46:51,305
Jesus is still very
popular among the people...

764
00:47:15,766 --> 00:47:20,294
We must use wisdom and find an
occasion to turn the people against him.

765
00:47:20,671 --> 00:47:22,263
Hosanna! Hosanna!

766
00:47:26,343 --> 00:47:27,241
Who... who is he?

767
00:47:27,845 --> 00:47:28,539
It's Jesus!

768
00:47:28,612 --> 00:47:30,273
Jesus of Nazareth!

769
00:47:30,347 --> 00:47:31,780
The miracle worker?

770
00:47:42,559 --> 00:47:44,720
A mob! He brings a mob!

771
00:47:44,795 --> 00:47:46,763
And encourages them at that!

772
00:47:47,531 --> 00:47:50,659
I tell you this is getting
seriously out of hand!

773
00:48:01,678 --> 00:48:03,168
That's not the cost of these things!

774
00:48:03,881 --> 00:48:05,143
You can take it or leave it!

775
00:48:08,485 --> 00:48:09,349
That's outrageous!

776
00:48:09,786 --> 00:48:10,844
lt isn't worth two coins!

777
00:48:11,555 --> 00:48:12,214
You heard me!

778
00:48:12,289 --> 00:48:14,154
No pay no doves...

779
00:48:14,224 --> 00:48:15,191
No atonement!

780
00:48:15,292 --> 00:48:16,316
Your choice!

781
00:48:16,393 --> 00:48:17,223
NEXT!

782
00:48:17,794 --> 00:48:18,920
We need to act!

783
00:48:19,196 --> 00:48:19,753
And soon!

784
00:48:20,631 --> 00:48:23,293
But I have brought my
own doves to sacrifice...

785
00:48:23,901 --> 00:48:25,459
I can't afford these...

786
00:48:26,203 --> 00:48:29,434
The only animals allowed for the
temple are the ones sold here...

787
00:48:29,506 --> 00:48:30,598
But why?

788
00:48:30,674 --> 00:48:32,904
Because the Pharisees
say so... that's why!

789
00:48:32,976 --> 00:48:34,307
Now pay up!

790
00:48:53,263 --> 00:48:55,424
Lord?

791
00:49:01,004 --> 00:49:03,939
Why... Why have you done this?

792
00:49:04,007 --> 00:49:11,436
Do not make my father's
house a house of merchandise.

793
00:49:12,349 --> 00:49:13,907
lt is a house of prayer.

794
00:49:16,320 --> 00:49:17,252
My money!
MY MONEY!

795
00:49:19,623 --> 00:49:21,716
Take it!
Take all of it out!

796
00:49:27,898 --> 00:49:30,526
How can you take advantage
of the people this way?

797
00:49:31,535 --> 00:49:32,729
Do you not fear God?

798
00:49:36,907 --> 00:49:37,874
Take all of it out!

799
00:49:39,576 --> 00:49:41,271
STOP! STOP!

800
00:49:45,549 --> 00:49:46,846
What is the meaning of this?

801
00:49:46,917 --> 00:49:47,713
What?

802
00:49:47,784 --> 00:49:49,547
IT IS WRITTEN!

803
00:49:49,619 --> 00:49:52,322
MY TEMPLE SHALL BE...

804
00:49:52,322 --> 00:49:54,756
a house of prayer!

805
00:49:57,461 --> 00:49:58,018
But you!...

806
00:49:58,295 --> 00:50:02,664
You have made it a den of thieves.

807
00:50:03,900 --> 00:50:05,026
No!

808
00:50:05,802 --> 00:50:06,928
JESUS OF NAZARETH!

809
00:50:10,374 --> 00:50:12,865
By what authority do
you do this! BY WHAT?

810
00:50:14,044 --> 00:50:18,538
DESTROY THIS TEMPLE AND I
WILL LIFT IT UP IN THREE DAYS!

811
00:50:19,516 --> 00:50:20,005
What...?

812
00:50:20,917 --> 00:50:23,977
Forty-six years it took to
build this temple and you...

813
00:50:24,087 --> 00:50:26,385
you will raise it up
again in three days!?

814
00:50:26,456 --> 00:50:27,616
YOU'RE A MADMAN!

815
00:50:29,026 --> 00:50:33,019
WOE UNTO YOU SCRIBES AND PHARISEES...

816
00:50:34,498 --> 00:50:35,328
HYPOCRITES!

817
00:50:35,399 --> 00:50:37,993
You whited tombs!

818
00:50:39,002 --> 00:50:40,560
You appear beautiful outside...

819
00:50:41,438 --> 00:50:42,336
but inside...

820
00:50:44,674 --> 00:50:45,402
inside...

821
00:50:45,509 --> 00:50:48,808
YOU ARE FULL OF DEAD MEN'S BONES!

822
00:50:49,913 --> 00:50:51,471
WOE TO YOU!

823
00:50:52,582 --> 00:50:55,745
You shut up the kingdom of
heaven to men by your own rules!

824
00:50:55,819 --> 00:50:59,755
Rules you cannot even
keep yourselves and you

825
00:50:59,823 --> 00:51:03,725
disregard the more
important matters of God:

826
00:51:04,494 --> 00:51:08,089
righteous judgment, mercy and faith!

827
00:51:10,100 --> 00:51:12,796
O Jerusalem, Jerusalem...

828
00:51:12,869 --> 00:51:19,741
you who kill the prophets and
stone the ones I send to help you...

829
00:51:21,745 --> 00:51:25,374
How often I would have gathered you as

830
00:51:25,449 --> 00:51:28,907
a hen gathers her
chicks under her wings...

831
00:51:28,985 --> 00:51:31,920
but you would not let me.

832
00:51:46,803 --> 00:51:48,532
I tell you it was outrageous!

833
00:51:49,039 --> 00:51:50,438
A threat to our authority!

834
00:51:50,774 --> 00:51:51,536
We must act!

835
00:51:51,608 --> 00:51:53,872
Our very inaction endorses Jesus!

836
00:51:54,644 --> 00:51:57,909
Are we to stand by while
he leads our people astray?

837
00:51:58,782 --> 00:52:04,618
Yet... I find nothing in his
doctrine that contradicts ours.

838
00:52:08,692 --> 00:52:11,024
I agree... his teaching is sound!

839
00:52:11,094 --> 00:52:14,825
Sound? You saw the commotion today!

840
00:52:16,032 --> 00:52:17,090
We must admit however...

841
00:52:17,167 --> 00:52:19,795
the selling of the animals
had gotten out of hand...

842
00:52:19,870 --> 00:52:23,601
discontent among the people in
that regard is nothing new...

843
00:52:23,673 --> 00:52:24,605
Perhaps...

844
00:52:24,674 --> 00:52:26,539
But the disruption in the temple...

845
00:52:27,210 --> 00:52:29,041
Where will it lead to next?

846
00:52:31,648 --> 00:52:37,985
And have I heard correctly that he
calls himself the King of the Jews?

847
00:52:38,822 --> 00:52:40,153
With your pardon, Caiaphas...

848
00:52:40,223 --> 00:52:42,453
His followers have given him that title.

849
00:52:43,860 --> 00:52:44,622
Nevertheless...

850
00:52:45,629 --> 00:52:49,121
He has not refuted it, which
makes him liable to treason!

851
00:52:51,768 --> 00:52:53,133
Consider then an alternative...

852
00:52:54,070 --> 00:52:56,163
That rather than lose
an entire nation...

853
00:52:57,174 --> 00:53:02,168
it would be better for
only one man to die!

854
00:53:07,250 --> 00:53:08,444
I agree with you Caiaphas!

855
00:53:08,518 --> 00:53:09,712
As do I!

856
00:53:09,786 --> 00:53:13,187
Jesus of Nazareth will bring
nothing but harm to our nation!

857
00:53:13,523 --> 00:53:15,013
He must be put out of the way...

858
00:53:19,262 --> 00:53:21,560
at the earliest opportunity.

859
00:53:24,501 --> 00:53:27,698
Since the situation at the
temple we do not know where he is.

860
00:53:38,248 --> 00:53:43,185
But... I believe I can
trace his whereabouts.

861
00:53:45,722 --> 00:53:46,916
Then see to it.

862
00:54:04,541 --> 00:54:05,235
No Lord!

863
00:54:06,276 --> 00:54:08,767
This is a job for servants...
not for you!

864
00:54:09,546 --> 00:54:10,513
Simon Peter...

865
00:54:11,214 --> 00:54:13,580
you call me Lord; and rightfully so,

866
00:54:13,683 --> 00:54:14,775
for that is what I am.

867
00:54:16,219 --> 00:54:19,916
Now that I, your Lord and
teacher, have washed your feet,

868
00:54:20,991 --> 00:54:23,221
you also should wash one another's feet.

869
00:54:24,327 --> 00:54:29,162
I have set you an example that you
should do as I have done for you.

870
00:54:30,567 --> 00:54:33,832
By this will all men know
what you are my disciples,

871
00:54:33,903 --> 00:54:36,303
if you love one another.

872
00:54:41,945 --> 00:54:45,005
I am glad that I can
share this time with you.

873
00:55:01,097 --> 00:55:03,998
Lord? What is it?

874
00:55:09,072 --> 00:55:11,233
One of you will betray me.

875
00:55:20,350 --> 00:55:22,181
Lord, who is it?

876
00:55:24,120 --> 00:55:24,916
ls it I?

877
00:55:26,823 --> 00:55:29,621
The one to whom I will give this bread,

878
00:55:31,895 --> 00:55:32,793
he will betray me.

879
00:55:53,383 --> 00:55:56,648
What you are about to do, do quickly!

880
00:56:18,942 --> 00:56:21,069
Take and eat.

881
00:56:22,011 --> 00:56:23,171
This is my body...

882
00:56:24,247 --> 00:56:25,839
which is broken for you.

883
00:56:33,089 --> 00:56:35,751
This is my blood.

884
00:56:36,426 --> 00:56:38,326
which will be poured for many...

885
00:56:39,796 --> 00:56:42,026
and for the forgiveness of sins.

886
00:56:51,074 --> 00:56:53,167
Now... where is he?

887
00:57:01,317 --> 00:57:05,720
This very night you will all
fall away on account of me.

888
00:57:07,457 --> 00:57:08,446
For it is written:

889
00:57:09,225 --> 00:57:13,457
I will strike the shepherd and
the sheep will be scattered.

890
00:57:15,298 --> 00:57:16,424
But after I have risen,

891
00:57:17,467 --> 00:57:19,196
I will go ahead of you into Galilee.

892
00:57:21,304 --> 00:57:24,933
Even if all fall away,
I never will, Lord!

893
00:57:25,909 --> 00:57:26,739
Never!

894
00:57:27,977 --> 00:57:31,936
Peter... Satan desires
to sift you as wheat...

895
00:57:33,116 --> 00:57:34,048
but I have prayed for you,

896
00:57:34,951 --> 00:57:36,942
that your faith may not fail.

897
00:57:38,855 --> 00:57:39,844
And when you are strengthened,

898
00:57:40,857 --> 00:57:42,017
encourage your brothers.

899
00:57:42,992 --> 00:57:45,290
I would even die for you!

900
00:57:46,062 --> 00:57:46,892
Peter...

901
00:57:47,363 --> 00:57:49,263
before the rooster crows this morning...

902
00:57:50,533 --> 00:57:53,366
you will have denied me three times.

903
00:57:54,938 --> 00:57:55,495
Never...

904
00:57:56,406 --> 00:57:57,100
Never!

905
00:59:13,550 --> 00:59:14,380
Father...

906
00:59:16,352 --> 00:59:17,284
if it is possible...

907
00:59:20,123 --> 00:59:21,954
may this cup be taken from me.

908
00:59:23,993 --> 00:59:24,584
Yet...

909
00:59:25,929 --> 00:59:26,861
not my will...

910
00:59:29,499 --> 00:59:31,967
but Your will be done!

911
00:59:44,647 --> 00:59:45,341
Lord.

912
00:59:55,191 --> 00:59:56,249
The hour has come.

913
00:59:57,594 --> 00:59:58,458
He that betrays me...

914
00:59:59,562 --> 01:00:00,358
is here.

915
01:00:11,541 --> 01:00:12,030
What's happening?

916
01:00:12,675 --> 01:00:13,232
Judas?

917
01:00:13,543 --> 01:00:14,202
What is going on here?

918
01:00:14,510 --> 01:00:15,135
Judas.

919
01:00:15,445 --> 01:00:16,912
Wait a minute?
What are these soldiers?

920
01:00:16,980 --> 01:00:18,572
...Rabbi!

921
01:00:18,648 --> 01:00:20,377
Judas?

922
01:00:20,450 --> 01:00:22,042
Do you betray me with a kiss?

923
01:00:25,488 --> 01:00:26,216
What's going on?

924
01:00:26,289 --> 01:00:27,551
Jesus, no...

925
01:00:27,657 --> 01:00:29,591
Who are you seeking?

926
01:00:31,260 --> 01:00:32,284
Jesus of Nazareth!

927
01:00:34,998 --> 01:00:35,657
I am he.

928
01:00:37,700 --> 01:00:39,998
Have you come out, as against a robber,

929
01:00:41,204 --> 01:00:43,001
with swords and clubs to take me?

930
01:00:44,340 --> 01:00:46,570
I was with you daily
in the temple teaching,

931
01:00:47,610 --> 01:00:49,077
and you did not seize me then.

932
01:00:51,314 --> 01:00:53,544
But the Scriptures must be fulfilled.

933
01:00:53,683 --> 01:00:55,548
Wait a minute.

934
01:00:55,618 --> 01:00:56,642
Take your hands off him!

935
01:00:56,719 --> 01:00:57,515
Leave him alone.

936
01:00:57,587 --> 01:00:58,576
Get away from him!

937
01:00:59,455 --> 01:01:01,423
Let him go! Let him go!

938
01:01:01,491 --> 01:01:02,082
That's enough!

939
01:01:02,558 --> 01:01:03,354
Auuuughhh!

940
01:01:03,426 --> 01:01:04,188
PETER!

941
01:01:04,327 --> 01:01:05,521
Get away from him...

942
01:01:05,595 --> 01:01:08,462
Auugghh!
Let me go!

943
01:01:08,531 --> 01:01:11,364
Put away the sword!

944
01:01:14,971 --> 01:01:16,700
Don't you think that I
can pray to My Father,

945
01:01:16,973 --> 01:01:20,465
and He will provide me with more
than twelve legions of angels?

946
01:01:22,412 --> 01:01:24,004
Be healed...

947
01:01:30,319 --> 01:01:32,651
Jesus... Jesus!

948
01:01:38,995 --> 01:01:41,657
Oh, Jesus!

949
01:01:41,731 --> 01:01:43,392
Jesus!

950
01:02:01,617 --> 01:02:03,983
Wait here.

951
01:02:04,053 --> 01:02:04,678
Where are you going?

952
01:02:06,189 --> 01:02:07,281
Perhaps I can find
out what is happening.

953
01:02:09,325 --> 01:02:10,986
John!

954
01:02:33,449 --> 01:02:34,438
Judas

955
01:02:49,398 --> 01:02:53,129
You have nothing to say
against these accusations?

956
01:03:02,845 --> 01:03:03,743
ANSWER THE HIGH PRIEST!

957
01:03:06,249 --> 01:03:11,585
I have spoken openly, in the
synagogues and in the temple.

958
01:03:13,189 --> 01:03:15,714
I have said nothing in secret.

959
01:03:17,560 --> 01:03:19,050
Why do you ask me?

960
01:03:19,796 --> 01:03:21,388
Ask those that heard me.

961
01:03:28,204 --> 01:03:29,637
Jesus...

962
01:03:34,844 --> 01:03:37,438
You dare to speak to
the High Priest that way?

963
01:03:45,321 --> 01:03:47,846
If I have spoken evil tell me...

964
01:03:49,192 --> 01:03:51,717
but if not... then why do you strike me?

965
01:03:54,697 --> 01:03:55,527
Caiaphas!

966
01:03:55,665 --> 01:03:56,359
ENOUGH!

967
01:03:57,466 --> 01:03:58,262
Enough...

968
01:04:03,606 --> 01:04:05,437
Let us get to the heart of the matter.

969
01:04:06,242 --> 01:04:07,266
There are people here...

970
01:04:07,343 --> 01:04:11,245
that have brought serious
accusation against you...

971
01:04:12,915 --> 01:04:14,314
They say that you....

972
01:04:16,586 --> 01:04:17,814
that you claim to be...

973
01:04:18,888 --> 01:04:20,879
the son of God?

974
01:04:32,668 --> 01:04:33,726
Tell us plainly.

975
01:04:34,871 --> 01:04:39,171
Are you the Christ, the
son of the living God?

976
01:04:42,879 --> 01:04:44,312
I am...

977
01:05:02,598 --> 01:05:05,829
And hereafter you shall
see me sitting at the

978
01:05:05,902 --> 01:05:10,271
right hand of God and coming
with the clouds of heaven.

979
01:05:17,346 --> 01:05:18,711
Silence! Silence!

980
01:05:37,600 --> 01:05:40,467
We need no further witnesses!

981
01:05:41,437 --> 01:05:43,735
You have heard his blasphemy!

982
01:05:44,740 --> 01:05:45,707
What say you?

983
01:05:46,642 --> 01:05:47,609
Death!

984
01:05:48,544 --> 01:05:49,340
Put him to death!

985
01:05:49,879 --> 01:05:50,846
Blasphemy!

986
01:05:51,514 --> 01:05:52,572
Kill him!

987
01:06:10,566 --> 01:06:10,964
Wait.

988
01:06:11,033 --> 01:06:13,365
You... You're one of his
followers, aren't you?

989
01:06:14,370 --> 01:06:16,736
No... No!

990
01:06:17,873 --> 01:06:18,601
Yes you are...

991
01:06:19,408 --> 01:06:21,000
I saw you with him...
I'm sure of it....

992
01:06:21,277 --> 01:06:22,904
You've got the wrong man.

993
01:06:26,615 --> 01:06:27,240
You are!

994
01:06:27,316 --> 01:06:29,750
You're a Galilean... a
follower of that Jesus.

995
01:06:30,820 --> 01:06:33,311
Yes... I saw you in the garden with him!

996
01:06:38,361 --> 01:06:39,259
I tell you!

997
01:06:41,697 --> 01:06:42,857
I DON'T KNOW THE MAN...

998
01:06:43,899 --> 01:06:44,763
I swear!

999
01:06:45,501 --> 01:06:47,332
I don't know him!

1000
01:07:31,380 --> 01:07:32,711
The law states it plainly...

1001
01:07:33,649 --> 01:07:34,411
Death!

1002
01:07:36,052 --> 01:07:37,041
Yet you are aware...

1003
01:07:37,119 --> 01:07:40,611
Roman rule prohibits us
from putting a man to death.

1004
01:07:42,625 --> 01:07:45,651
But not the Romans...
take him to Pilate.

1005
01:07:47,997 --> 01:07:51,057
Please, please, I must speak to you.

1006
01:07:51,767 --> 01:07:52,791
I MUST SPEAK TO YOU!

1007
01:07:54,070 --> 01:07:55,503
It's alright. Let him go.

1008
01:07:57,640 --> 01:07:59,733
I have betrayed innocent blood!

1009
01:08:03,546 --> 01:08:05,343
Take it back!
TAKE IT!

1010
01:08:09,652 --> 01:08:12,519
I HAVE SINNED BY
BETRAYING INNOCENT BLOOD!

1011
01:08:14,123 --> 01:08:15,454
And what is that to us?

1012
01:08:21,964 --> 01:08:23,363
I have sinned...

1013
01:08:53,662 --> 01:08:55,425
John!

1014
01:09:06,208 --> 01:09:08,472
It's Jesus, isn't it?

1015
01:09:09,044 --> 01:09:12,741
Oh, my son!

1016
01:09:12,815 --> 01:09:14,009
MY SON!

1017
01:09:16,185 --> 01:09:17,652
He was taken to Pontius Pilate...

1018
01:09:18,921 --> 01:09:19,910
There is to be an announcement...

1019
01:09:22,892 --> 01:09:23,586
Take me to him.

1020
01:09:24,226 --> 01:09:25,420
Take me!

1021
01:09:50,085 --> 01:09:53,612
You brought me a man that
you say has broken the law.

1022
01:09:55,157 --> 01:09:58,615
I questioned him and found
him guilty of no crime,

1023
01:10:00,763 --> 01:10:03,527
but you insisted on punishment...

1024
01:10:07,570 --> 01:10:09,731
and therefore he has been punished.

1025
01:10:10,806 --> 01:10:11,568
...thirty eight!

1026
01:10:11,640 --> 01:10:12,129
Auuughhhh!

1027
01:10:12,208 --> 01:10:13,038
...thirty nine!

1028
01:10:14,710 --> 01:10:15,608
...forty!

1029
01:10:16,745 --> 01:10:17,541
Let him down.

1030
01:10:21,083 --> 01:10:21,913
Bring him!

1031
01:10:21,984 --> 01:10:23,178
Pilate wants him now!

1032
01:10:25,754 --> 01:10:29,952
Wait!
Let's not forget his crown.

1033
01:10:42,171 --> 01:10:44,503
Behold, the man!

1034
01:10:59,555 --> 01:11:01,250
What have you done to
make them hate you so...?

1035
01:11:06,895 --> 01:11:07,793
We have a custom...

1036
01:11:08,797 --> 01:11:12,289
to free one prisoner
during your festive days.

1037
01:11:14,069 --> 01:11:15,001
What say you?

1038
01:11:15,871 --> 01:11:17,133
Shall I deliver to you...

1039
01:11:17,940 --> 01:11:19,908
Jesus who is called Christ...

1040
01:11:20,876 --> 01:11:21,740
Jesus...

1041
01:11:23,912 --> 01:11:24,776
or...

1042
01:11:25,681 --> 01:11:26,579
Barabbas?

1043
01:11:35,758 --> 01:11:36,122
Barabbas!

1044
01:11:36,625 --> 01:11:39,116
The Pharisees want you
to call out for Barabbas!

1045
01:11:40,329 --> 01:11:41,057
It's Barabbas.

1046
01:11:41,697 --> 01:11:43,062
Remember that's what the Pharisees want.

1047
01:11:44,266 --> 01:11:46,234
Which of the two do you
want me to release to you?

1048
01:11:47,903 --> 01:11:48,927
BARABBAS! FREE BARABBAS!

1049
01:11:50,072 --> 01:11:50,663
Barrabas!

1050
01:11:51,206 --> 01:11:52,195
Free Barrabas!

1051
01:12:00,783 --> 01:12:01,647
And what of this man?

1052
01:12:02,351 --> 01:12:06,310
What then shall I do with this
Jesus who is called Christ?

1053
01:12:07,956 --> 01:12:08,650
Crucify him!

1054
01:12:11,093 --> 01:12:11,889
NO!

1055
01:12:13,028 --> 01:12:15,690
But why... what evil has he done?

1056
01:12:17,866 --> 01:12:19,857
WHAT EVIL HAS HE DONE?

1057
01:12:19,968 --> 01:12:24,371
We have a law, and according
to that law he must die,

1058
01:12:25,007 --> 01:12:27,635
because he claimed to be the Son of God!

1059
01:12:35,417 --> 01:12:36,315
Where do you come from?...

1060
01:12:38,354 --> 01:12:40,322
Do you refuse to speak with me?

1061
01:12:41,423 --> 01:12:46,122
Don't you realize I have power to
either free you or to crucify you?

1062
01:12:47,696 --> 01:12:53,259
You would have no power over me if
it were not given to you from above.

1063
01:12:54,770 --> 01:13:01,073
Therefore the one who handed me over
to you is guilty of a greater sin.

1064
01:13:07,750 --> 01:13:11,345
I tell you I find no fault in this man!

1065
01:13:13,789 --> 01:13:15,222
He calls himself a King!

1066
01:13:15,891 --> 01:13:16,380
And?

1067
01:13:18,160 --> 01:13:20,094
WE HAVE NO KING BUT CAESAR!

1068
01:13:20,829 --> 01:13:22,296
And you know good and
well that acknowledging

1069
01:13:22,431 --> 01:13:26,731
Jesus as king is nothing
more than... Treason!

1070
01:13:35,711 --> 01:13:38,805
Then bear record, that I am innocent of

1071
01:13:38,881 --> 01:13:42,078
this man's death for
I find no fault in him.

1072
01:13:43,085 --> 01:13:47,454
I am innocent of the
blood of this just person.

1073
01:13:48,257 --> 01:13:49,246
See you to it!

1074
01:13:57,132 --> 01:13:58,861
No! My son!

1075
01:13:59,101 --> 01:14:00,728
His blood be upon us!

1076
01:14:01,236 --> 01:14:02,168
And on our children!

1077
01:14:48,484 --> 01:14:49,348
As it is written...

1078
01:14:50,486 --> 01:14:52,454
He was despised and rejected by men...

1079
01:14:54,890 --> 01:14:57,188
a man of sorrows, and
familiar with suffering.

1080
01:14:59,895 --> 01:15:02,386
Surely he took up our infirmities
and carried our sorrows...

1081
01:15:03,398 --> 01:15:06,856
yet we considered him stricken by God,

1082
01:15:06,969 --> 01:15:10,234
smitten by him, and afflicted.

1083
01:15:20,482 --> 01:15:22,814
He was pierced for our transgressions,

1084
01:15:25,287 --> 01:15:28,051
he was crushed for our iniquities the

1085
01:15:28,123 --> 01:15:30,990
punishment that brought
us peace was upon him,

1086
01:15:33,095 --> 01:15:38,123
and by his wounds we are healed.

1087
01:15:39,434 --> 01:15:40,492
AUUUUGHHHHH!

1088
01:15:46,041 --> 01:15:48,373
We all, like sheep, have gone astray...

1089
01:15:55,183 --> 01:15:59,244
each of us has turned to his own
way and the LORD has laid on him...

1090
01:15:59,321 --> 01:16:02,950
the iniquity of us all!

1091
01:16:16,138 --> 01:16:19,505
Ha ha! He saved others!
Yet, he cannot save himself.

1092
01:16:20,509 --> 01:16:22,101
Let him come down from the cross,

1093
01:16:22,177 --> 01:16:24,077
and we will believe in him.

1094
01:16:24,146 --> 01:16:27,513
Let God rescue him now if he wants him!

1095
01:16:27,583 --> 01:16:31,178
After all, didn't he say
he was the son of God?

1096
01:16:35,157 --> 01:16:37,921
Father, forgive them.

1097
01:16:39,227 --> 01:16:41,024
They don't know what they are doing.

1098
01:16:43,065 --> 01:16:44,396
Aren't you the Christ?

1099
01:16:45,133 --> 01:16:46,896
Then save yourself... and us!

1100
01:16:47,669 --> 01:16:48,499
Quiet!

1101
01:16:49,237 --> 01:16:50,499
Don't you have any fear of God...

1102
01:16:51,340 --> 01:16:52,170
even now?

1103
01:16:53,508 --> 01:16:54,099
We are criminals.

1104
01:16:54,276 --> 01:16:56,176
We deserve this...

1105
01:16:56,244 --> 01:16:58,075
but this man...

1106
01:16:58,146 --> 01:17:00,876
he has done nothing wrong...

1107
01:17:00,949 --> 01:17:02,246
nothing at all.

1108
01:17:05,420 --> 01:17:06,352
Jesus...

1109
01:17:08,523 --> 01:17:12,118
remember me when you enter your kingdom.

1110
01:17:14,029 --> 01:17:14,961
I tell you the truth.

1111
01:17:16,698 --> 01:17:17,392
Today...

1112
01:17:18,433 --> 01:17:19,365
You will be with me...

1113
01:17:20,402 --> 01:17:21,198
in paradise.

1114
01:17:29,077 --> 01:17:34,105
For three hours he agonized
on the cross and then at noon...

1115
01:17:34,449 --> 01:17:36,610
a strange thing happened...

1116
01:17:37,686 --> 01:17:40,655
Darkness came over all the land

1117
01:17:40,722 --> 01:17:43,919
and remained that way
for another three hours.

1118
01:18:00,575 --> 01:18:01,371
Mother...

1119
01:18:02,210 --> 01:18:04,144
this is your son...

1120
01:18:05,614 --> 01:18:07,081
this is your mother.

1121
01:18:08,717 --> 01:18:09,376
Father!

1122
01:18:10,552 --> 01:18:14,010
Father why have you forsaken me?

1123
01:18:21,730 --> 01:18:27,134
lt is finished...

1124
01:18:29,137 --> 01:18:30,001
Father...

1125
01:18:31,506 --> 01:18:38,674
into your hands I commit my spirit.

1126
01:18:43,051 --> 01:18:46,578
When He died the earth shook,

1127
01:18:46,655 --> 01:18:51,683
the rocks split and the curtain
of the temple was ripped in two!

1128
01:19:01,036 --> 01:19:06,099
Surely this man... was the son of God.

1129
01:19:12,748 --> 01:19:18,209
That deceiver, Jesus, while he
was still alive... he said...

1130
01:19:18,320 --> 01:19:22,347
After three days I will arise again.

1131
01:19:22,424 --> 01:19:26,793
ln order to avoid any further
deceit, command a guard at the tomb...

1132
01:19:28,497 --> 01:19:29,464
and seal it.

1133
01:19:30,132 --> 01:19:32,794
Let his disciples come
and steal away the body...

1134
01:19:33,068 --> 01:19:37,266
and then say unto the people
that he has risen from the dead.

1135
01:19:40,108 --> 01:19:41,200
Agreed.

1136
01:19:41,276 --> 01:19:43,540
Go and make it as sure as you can.

1137
01:19:57,192 --> 01:19:58,284
Three days!

1138
01:19:59,394 --> 01:20:00,622
So you keep reminding me!

1139
01:20:01,463 --> 01:20:03,761
Three days guarding this tomb!

1140
01:20:04,666 --> 01:20:06,827
We don't have to guard all
these other dead people,

1141
01:20:07,169 --> 01:20:07,794
but this one...

1142
01:20:07,869 --> 01:20:10,269
this one we have to guard!

1143
01:20:10,338 --> 01:20:16,675
All because of some idiotic superstition
that he's going to rise from the dead!?

1144
01:20:17,712 --> 01:20:19,270
No one rises from the dead?

1145
01:20:19,381 --> 01:20:21,349
Which is why we're here!

1146
01:20:21,416 --> 01:20:25,580
So none of his followers steal the
body and then claim that he did!

1147
01:20:26,188 --> 01:20:27,120
Now quit complaining.

1148
01:20:29,491 --> 01:20:31,459
Of course no one rises from the dead.

1149
01:21:15,704 --> 01:21:16,568
What was that...

1150
01:21:17,405 --> 01:21:18,531
A tremor...

1151
01:21:18,607 --> 01:21:19,835
An earthquake...

1152
01:21:21,209 --> 01:21:21,834
I don't know.

1153
01:21:23,311 --> 01:21:23,902
Didn't sleep again?

1154
01:21:26,481 --> 01:21:27,880
You need sleep!

1155
01:21:29,517 --> 01:21:31,144
I need peace...

1156
01:21:32,821 --> 01:21:34,186
I denied him, John...

1157
01:21:34,256 --> 01:21:36,156
I... failed him.

1158
01:21:37,459 --> 01:21:38,653
We were all afraid.

1159
01:21:40,729 --> 01:21:43,254
I wish I could tell
him how ashamed I am...

1160
01:21:44,266 --> 01:21:44,823
I wish I could...

1161
01:21:50,605 --> 01:21:52,163
Shhhhh.

1162
01:21:57,812 --> 01:21:59,370
I thought you said no
one knew we were here.

1163
01:21:59,481 --> 01:22:00,914
They don't .

1164
01:22:00,982 --> 01:22:02,574
I'll go see..

1165
01:22:02,684 --> 01:22:04,174
James. No!

1166
01:22:10,926 --> 01:22:11,688
Mary!

1167
01:22:11,760 --> 01:22:12,727
I saw him!

1168
01:22:12,794 --> 01:22:13,726
Who?

1169
01:22:13,795 --> 01:22:16,320
The Lord! I saw him! He's alive!

1170
01:22:16,398 --> 01:22:17,228
What?

1171
01:22:17,299 --> 01:22:18,357
He has risen.

1172
01:22:18,433 --> 01:22:19,661
He has risen from the dead!

1173
01:22:23,972 --> 01:22:29,308
And he had indeed risen... he
was no longer in the tomb.

1174
01:22:30,979 --> 01:22:31,843
But how?

1175
01:22:32,547 --> 01:22:33,980
The tomb was empty.

1176
01:22:34,749 --> 01:22:37,718
The shroud was there, but no body.

1177
01:22:38,753 --> 01:22:40,345
Jesus was gone.

1178
01:22:41,690 --> 01:22:45,217
That same day, he appeared
to some of his disciples.

1179
01:22:49,531 --> 01:22:50,623
Thomas, we saw him...

1180
01:22:50,699 --> 01:22:51,324
spoke with him!

1181
01:22:51,466 --> 01:22:52,524
I told you!

1182
01:22:52,600 --> 01:22:53,726
Impossible!

1183
01:22:55,637 --> 01:22:57,969
Unless I can place my
finger on the imprint

1184
01:22:58,039 --> 01:23:00,530
of the nails and thrust
my hand into his side,

1185
01:23:00,608 --> 01:23:02,337
I WILL NOT BELIEVE!

1186
01:23:02,444 --> 01:23:04,275
Peace be unto you.

1187
01:23:06,648 --> 01:23:07,444
I... I...

1188
01:23:09,050 --> 01:23:10,244
Reach with your finger...

1189
01:23:11,953 --> 01:23:12,977
and touch my hands.

1190
01:23:14,990 --> 01:23:18,585
And reach out your hand
and thrust it into my side.

1191
01:23:20,295 --> 01:23:22,786
And be not faithless... but believing.

1192
01:23:26,935 --> 01:23:29,665
MY LORD... AND MY GOD!

1193
01:23:31,740 --> 01:23:33,867
Thomas, because you have seen me,

1194
01:23:33,942 --> 01:23:35,000
you have believed.

1195
01:23:37,679 --> 01:23:41,342
Blessed are they that have
not seen and yet believe.

1196
01:23:52,494 --> 01:23:54,758
Simon Peter... do you love me?

1197
01:23:54,829 --> 01:23:58,856
Lord, these three times
you have asked me...

1198
01:23:59,868 --> 01:24:00,960
You know all things.

1199
01:24:02,370 --> 01:24:03,394
You know I love you.

1200
01:24:06,541 --> 01:24:07,473
Feed my sheep.

1201
01:24:09,444 --> 01:24:12,743
Simon Peter, when you were a
younger man you did as you pleased,

1202
01:24:13,648 --> 01:24:15,013
went wherever you wanted to.

1203
01:24:15,083 --> 01:24:16,983
But now in your age...

1204
01:24:17,052 --> 01:24:19,612
God will take you and lead you;

1205
01:24:20,555 --> 01:24:23,581
sometimes to places you
never wanted to go to.

1206
01:24:25,493 --> 01:24:26,425
Will you go Peter?

1207
01:24:27,595 --> 01:24:28,857
Will you go for me?

1208
01:24:31,499 --> 01:24:32,625
Yes Lord...

1209
01:24:32,734 --> 01:24:34,759
I will go wherever you ask me,

1210
01:24:34,836 --> 01:24:36,861
I will follow with all my heart.

1211
01:24:38,840 --> 01:24:40,398
What about John, Lord...

1212
01:24:40,475 --> 01:24:41,567
what about him?

1213
01:24:42,644 --> 01:24:44,009
Don't worry about John!

1214
01:24:45,080 --> 01:24:47,571
If it's my will that he
live until I get back...

1215
01:24:48,550 --> 01:24:49,778
what does that matter to you?

1216
01:24:49,851 --> 01:24:52,649
You just follow me.

1217
01:25:05,767 --> 01:25:10,397
And so it was commonly thought
that disciple would not die...

1218
01:25:11,106 --> 01:25:14,837
or rather that he would not die
at the hands of his enemies...

1219
01:25:17,512 --> 01:25:19,104
And so it was...

1220
01:25:22,417 --> 01:25:23,611
You?

1221
01:25:24,686 --> 01:25:29,623
Yes... the others, all
died a martyrs death.

1222
01:25:29,691 --> 01:25:33,491
Each one taking the
message of Jesus to the

1223
01:25:33,561 --> 01:25:37,122
surrounding countries that
they too may come to know God

1224
01:25:37,198 --> 01:25:40,531
even though it cost
them their very lives.

1225
01:25:41,936 --> 01:25:44,803
I alone of the twelve remain...

1226
01:25:44,873 --> 01:25:49,105
a witness to all Jesus did and said...

1227
01:25:49,177 --> 01:25:52,044
to the miracles, to the love...

1228
01:25:52,113 --> 01:25:54,138
and to his parting message:

1229
01:25:55,984 --> 01:26:00,944
Go into all the world and preach
the Good News to every creature.

1230
01:26:02,223 --> 01:26:06,421
Whoever receives me, will
be saved and I will love him

1231
01:26:07,061 --> 01:26:09,586
and will come and
make his heart my home.

1232
01:26:10,932 --> 01:26:14,629
And remember... I will
be with you always...

1233
01:26:15,236 --> 01:26:17,898
even to the end of the world.

1234
01:26:20,542 --> 01:26:21,440
So you see?

1235
01:26:21,509 --> 01:26:26,537
How can I deny what I
have seen with my own eyes?

1236
01:26:27,215 --> 01:26:30,150
And what I know to be true in my heart...

1237
01:26:31,119 --> 01:26:38,787
that Jesus Christ, is the Son of God who
died to take away the sins of the world.

1238
01:26:39,561 --> 01:26:42,462
My sins and yours as well.

1239
01:26:43,531 --> 01:26:45,499
And who rose again from the dead!

1240
01:26:48,870 --> 01:26:51,771
And now that you have heard the story...

1241
01:26:53,074 --> 01:26:59,638
what will you believe?
