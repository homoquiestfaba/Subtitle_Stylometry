Mm, like that.

Oh. Oh, wait, wait, wait.       
Wait, baby, hold on.            

17
00:02:50,770 --> 00:02:53,471
     - What's wrong, baby?      
     - Hold on a second.        

18
00:02:53,506 --> 00:02:56,675
Um, you know

A pack?                         
You only need one.              

26

   out for my best interests,

       not the network's.

  about this contract thing.    

62

       The truth is, the network

 <i> to finish with high ratings.</i>  

64
00:08:00,547 --> 00:08:02,814
       And quite frankly,       
 they offered me a lot of money 

65
00:08:02,849 --> 00:08:04,282
     to secure your return.     

66
00:08:04,317 --> 00:08:06,284
 Well, they can keep the money. 

67
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:08,653
  Well, it's a little too late  
           for that.

Okay, girl, remind me           
why I'm going camping again?    

128
00:11:56,516 --> 00:11:59,250
   Because you're my best friend
   and you want me to be happy. 

129
00:11:59,285 --> 00:12:01,919
Yeah, right. Okay,              
so hanging out in the woods     

130
00:12:01,954 --> 00:12:04,455
just pop in your head           
or something?                   

131
00:12:04,490 --> 00:12:07,492

   but it'll be fun, you'll see.

is very high on the list.       

135
00:12:16,569 --> 00:12:19,771
 No, Freida. Some black folks do
 enjoy hanging out in the woods.

  and at some point, sweetie,   

137
00:12:22,275 --> 00:12:23,842
       you have to decide       
       which one you are.       

138

 - How I do what?

                Ain't easy, bro.

       you know what I'm saying?

145
00:12:42,995 --> 00:12:45,496

that'll change this weekend.    

147

247
00:19:43,782 --> 00:19:47,418
 Freida:<i> Yeah, right. That's why</i>
<i> I didn't want to come up here.</i> 

248
00:19:47,453 --> 00:19:49,286
 Caprice:<i> This place is creepy.</i> 

249
00:19:49,321 --> 00:19:51,522
 Monica:<i> Relax, you guys. Dwayne</i>
 <i> and I have been here before.</i>  

250
00:19:51,557 --> 00:19:54,992
<i> It's safe. Just looks a little</i> 
 <i> creepy at night, that's all.</i>  

251
00:19:55,027 --> 00:19:56,494
        Freida:<i> Mm-hmm.</i>         

252
00:20:09,808 --> 00:20:12,310
      <i> ( thunder rumbles )</i>      

253
00:20:14,446 --> 00:20:16,780
  Come on, guys, head inside.   

254
00:20:16,815 --> 00:20:17,915
   <i> It looks like it's about</i>    
       <i> to start to rain.</i>       

255

         ( air hisses )         

257
00:20:51,884 --> 00:20:55,986
            Yo, this is nice, D.

258
00:20:56,021 --> 00:20:57,821
( indistinct chatter )          

259
00:20:57,856 --> 00:21:00,691
   Johnny:<i> This is nice, man.</i>   

260
00:21:00,726 --> 00:21:04,295
    That's what I'm saying.     
         This is nice.          

261
00:21:04,330 --> 00:21:07,298
This is how you live            
when your girl's got            
a number one hit show.          

262
00:21:07,333 --> 00:21:09,700
       Johnny: Hey, all,        
        check this out.         

263
00:21:11,503 --> 00:21:15,739
Oh, whoa. No, no, no, no.       
Yo, come on, man. Please, dawg. 

264
00:21:15,774 --> 00:21:18,642
Come on, man, the owner's       
a huge art freak, all right?    

265
00:21:18,677 --> 00:21:21,545
He's very sensitive             
about his shit.                 

266
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:23,681
          So let's not fuck with
          his shit, please.     

267
00:21:23,716 --> 00:21:25,816
       - All right, dawg.       
         - Sorry, man.          

268
00:21:25,851 --> 00:21:26,850
What'd y'all do with--          
Was there something in this?    

269
00:21:26,885 --> 00:21:27,951
                     Where what?

270
00:21:27,986 --> 00:21:30,854
         ( gibberish )          

271
00:21:30,889 --> 00:21:33,757
     Man, damn, Troy.           
     That shit ain't even funny.

272
00:21:33,792 --> 00:21:35,593
       Didn't I say             
       don't fuck with his shit?

273
00:21:39,732 --> 00:21:42,099
 Could you be any more stupid?  

274
00:21:42,134 --> 00:21:45,770
   Just a dumb mask. Wasn't like
   I was gonna kill somebody.   

275
00:21:46,939 --> 00:21:48,806
           Hey, babe.           

276
00:21:48,841 --> 00:21:50,641
     ( indistinct chatter )     

277
00:21:50,676 --> 00:21:52,476
     -<i> Okay. </i>                   
     - Keep an eye on him.      

278
00:21:59,685 --> 00:22:01,752
     ( indistinct chatter )     

279
00:22:01,787 --> 00:22:06,390
        Well, I'll be a monkey's
        second cousin. Dwayne.  

280
00:22:06,425 --> 00:22:08,692
You got to be kidding me, right?

281
00:22:08,727 --> 00:22:10,094
            <i> Monica.</i>            

282
00:22:10,129 --> 00:22:12,563
I don't believe this shit.      

283
00:22:16,735 --> 00:22:19,503
        So, we're driving along,
        minding your business,  

284
00:22:19,538 --> 00:22:21,605
     when all of a sudden, boom,

285
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:24,375
        my tire blows           
        like a hooker on Sunset.

286
00:22:24,410 --> 00:22:27,111
         Ha ha ha. I try to call
         the local tow company  

287
00:22:27,146 --> 00:22:29,847
        with my cell phone, but 
        I couldn't get a signal.

288
00:22:29,882 --> 00:22:33,417
Mm. You honestly expect me      
to believe that?                

289
00:22:33,452 --> 00:22:36,553
      It's the truth, Baby Gurl.
      Isn't that right, Daffy?  

290
00:22:36,588 --> 00:22:39,523
   Hmm? Actually, it's Dapny.   

291
00:22:41,827 --> 00:22:43,861
    What was my line again?     

292
00:22:43,896 --> 00:22:46,797
Greg, let me talk to you        
for a second.                   

293
00:22:50,469 --> 00:22:52,169
Okay, cut the crap.             

294
00:22:52,204 --> 00:22:55,839
   I'm dead serious, Monica.    
   This was totally unrehearsed.

295
00:22:55,874 --> 00:22:58,776
    I got a flat tire, and      
    the heavens were kind enough

296
00:22:58,811 --> 00:23:01,178
       to place me              
       in the reassuring company
       of friends.              

297
00:23:01,213 --> 00:23:05,482
And you didn't follow me up here
to get me to sign the contract? 

298
00:23:05,517 --> 00:23:07,918
        It's funny, I never even
        thought of that.        

299
00:23:07,953 --> 00:23:10,621
( sighs )                       

300
00:23:10,656 --> 00:23:13,991
All right, you can              
stay here tonight,              

301
00:23:14,026 --> 00:23:16,460
but you have to be gone         
by morning, okay?               

302
00:23:16,495 --> 00:23:17,528
                  Scout's honor.

303
00:23:25,204 --> 00:23:27,838
So it looks like you two        
worked everything out.          

304
00:23:27,873 --> 00:23:29,673
          Yeah. He's gonna leave
          in the morning.       

305
00:23:29,708 --> 00:23:32,142
Okay.                           

306
00:23:32,177 --> 00:23:35,179
All right, Gregory,             
so you and your friend,         

307
00:23:35,214 --> 00:23:37,181
you guys can sleep in the spare 
 bedroom down in the basement.  

308
00:23:37,216 --> 00:23:39,149
    Troy, you got the couch.    

309
00:23:39,184 --> 00:23:41,952
   Come on. I'm your cousin.    
How you gonna give me the couch?

310
00:23:41,987 --> 00:23:44,688
 <i> You can sleep outside, then.</i>  

311
00:23:44,723 --> 00:23:46,723
    Right. Oh, and don't get    
        too comfortable.        

312
00:23:46,758 --> 00:23:49,226
         You're leaving         
      in the morning, too.      

313
00:23:49,261 --> 00:23:51,929
         And for the rest of us,
         this weekend's gonna be
         off the chain.         

314
00:23:51,964 --> 00:23:53,163
             Yeah.              

315
00:23:53,198 --> 00:23:55,132
       And we got hiking,       

316
00:23:55,167 --> 00:23:58,168
                 we got camping,
                 rock climbing, 

317
00:23:58,203 --> 00:23:59,970
                    and fishing.

318
00:24:00,005 --> 00:24:02,473
       So if I were you, I'd get
       a good night's sleep,    

319
00:24:02,508 --> 00:24:04,775
 <i> 'cause after tonight, we're</i>   
 <i> gonna be sleeping out there.</i>  

320
00:24:04,810 --> 00:24:07,211
      ( thunder rumbles )       

321
00:24:07,246 --> 00:24:10,914
         But, Dwayne,           
         it's raining out there.

322
00:24:10,949 --> 00:24:14,017
     Don't worry about it.      
 Storm's gonna pass by morning. 

323
00:24:14,052 --> 00:24:17,588
  All right, let's wrap it up.  
   See y'all in the morning.    

324
00:24:17,623 --> 00:24:19,590
     - Turn in, baby?           
     - Yeah, sure. Why not?     

325
00:24:19,625 --> 00:24:22,960
               I think I'm gonna
               turn in as well. 

326
00:24:22,995 --> 00:24:24,895
   -<i> Freida, you coming up? </i>    
   -<i> Yeah.</i>                      

327
00:24:24,930 --> 00:24:27,130
            Hey, hey, thickness,

328
00:24:27,165 --> 00:24:30,000
       you need somebody        
       to keep you warm tonight?

329
00:24:30,035 --> 00:24:32,636
It's warm enough                
from your hot-ass breath.       

330
00:24:32,671 --> 00:24:35,706
      Look, if you don't scream,
      I won't holla.            

331
00:24:35,741 --> 00:24:37,908
Yes, you will once I kick you   
in the balls.                   

332
00:24:37,943 --> 00:24:39,743
Why don't you leave me alone?   

333
00:24:50,889 --> 00:24:51,855
       What do you think?       

334
00:24:51,890 --> 00:24:53,891
     Mm, I like. I like it.     

335
00:24:53,926 --> 00:24:55,893
                 Come here, you.

336
00:24:55,928 --> 00:24:58,695
Mm. Thank you for putting       
this whole thing together, baby.

337
00:24:58,730 --> 00:25:02,299
I know it's gonna be            
a great weekend.                

338
00:25:02,334 --> 00:25:04,067
I love you so much.             

339
00:25:04,102 --> 00:25:06,070
                I love you, too.

340
00:25:11,810 --> 00:25:13,544
      <i> Why did you make me</i>      
         <i>   come up here?</i>       

341
00:25:13,579 --> 00:25:16,880
    - What do you mean--        
    - You know I don't like     
      your friends, Malik.      

342
00:25:16,915 --> 00:25:18,849
   - Stacy--                    
   - And they don't like me.    

343
00:25:18,884 --> 00:25:21,885
Now you just overreacting,      
all right?                      

344
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:24,321
        Who's my bitch?         
        Who's my bitch?         

345
00:25:24,356 --> 00:25:25,822
                           I am.

346
00:25:25,857 --> 00:25:27,558
       ( woman screams )        

347
00:25:27,593 --> 00:25:29,126
What the hell was that?         

348
00:25:29,161 --> 00:25:31,795
 Monica?                        

349
00:25:31,830 --> 00:25:34,965
        Johnny, wake up.        
    I think Monica screamed.    

350
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,201
             <i> What?</i>             

351
00:25:41,707 --> 00:25:43,140
        ( both chuckle )        

352
00:25:43,175 --> 00:25:44,775
               Look.            

353
00:25:44,810 --> 00:25:46,677
         No, he didn't.         

354
00:25:46,712 --> 00:25:49,346
            Aah,                
            I'm getting married.

355
00:25:49,381 --> 00:25:51,248
Congrats, Baby Gurl.            

356
00:25:51,283 --> 00:25:53,350
          Oh, my God.           

357
00:25:53,385 --> 00:25:55,819
     ( indistinct chatter )     

358
00:25:55,854 --> 00:25:58,221
Oh, my God, Monica,             
it's beautiful.                 

359
00:25:58,256 --> 00:25:59,823
     ( indistinct chatter )     

360
00:25:59,858 --> 00:26:01,625
Way to go, playa.               

361
00:26:01,660 --> 00:26:03,293
   Aw, that's a nice rock, D.   

362
00:26:03,328 --> 00:26:05,128
  - You know how I do, buddy.   
  - You know what, man?         

363
00:26:05,163 --> 00:26:08,131
- I say this calls for a toast. 
  What y'all think?             
- Yeah.                         

364
00:26:08,166 --> 00:26:10,334
     T, there's a couple bottles
     of bubbly in the kitchen.  
     Go handle that.            

365
00:26:10,369 --> 00:26:11,302
I'm on it.                      

366
00:26:15,907 --> 00:26:18,675
  Yo, Johnny, man,              
  find some music on the tube.  

367
00:26:18,710 --> 00:26:21,678
 - Get some sounds up in here.  
 - That's a great idea.         

368
00:26:21,713 --> 00:26:25,315
- Let's get this party started. 
- Yeah, party!                  

369
00:26:25,350 --> 00:26:27,918

  <i> A brutal and bizarre murder</i>

371
00:26:30,656 --> 00:26:32,789
                  Wait a minute.
                  What's this?  

372
00:26:32,824 --> 00:26:34,358
      <i> ...reeling tonight.</i>

      Well, if ain't nobody else

391
00:27:23,442 --> 00:27:26,143
   What's up with your cousin?  
   Is that fool psycho, or what?

392
00:27:26,178 --> 00:27:28,145
  <i> 'Cause I ain't in the mood</i>   
           <i> for this.</i>           

393
00:27:28,180 --> 00:27:29,813
     Yo, Troy's a lot of things,
     but he ain't no killer.    

394
00:27:29,848 --> 00:27:33,216
            You saw the drawing.
            It was Troy.        

395
00:27:33,251 --> 00:27:35,118
          Maybe it was somebody 
          that looked like Troy.

396
00:27:35,153 --> 00:27:37,154
                 They don't even
                 give a name.   

397
00:27:37,189 --> 00:27:39,322
   Didn't he get out of jail    
         for something?         

398
00:27:39,357 --> 00:27:42,426
       I don't know, man.       

399
00:27:42,461 --> 00:27:45,162
         Look, if it's gonna    
         make y'all feel better,

400
00:27:45,197 --> 00:27:48,232
      I'll go talk to him       
      and clear this all up now.

401
00:28:02,214 --> 00:28:03,847
                        Yo, cuz.

402
00:28:03,882 --> 00:28:05,782
Damn, cuz. Don't be             
coming up on me like that.      

403
00:28:05,817 --> 00:28:07,484
Almost made me drop the bubbly. 

404
00:28:07,519 --> 00:28:09,453
          Relax, man.           
     I need to talk to you.     

405
00:28:09,488 --> 00:28:12,155
           What's up?           

406
00:28:12,190 --> 00:28:13,924
       Is there anything        
      you want to tell me?      

407
00:28:19,498 --> 00:28:22,933
     <i> It's all right, man.</i>      

408
00:28:22,968 --> 00:28:25,202
  I got my salad tossed once,   
 but I swear I didn't like it.  

409
00:28:25,237 --> 00:28:28,872
   Troy, I'm talking are you    
   in some type of trouble?     

410
00:28:28,907 --> 00:28:32,375
Oh, no, not me, cuz.            
I'm a law-abiding citizen now.  

411
00:28:32,410 --> 00:28:35,178
             So you don't know  
             anybody named K.D.?

412
00:28:35,213 --> 00:28:36,847
              Who?              

413
00:28:36,882 --> 00:28:38,849
              K.D.              

414
00:28:38,884 --> 00:28:42,786
  Nah, it doesn't ring a bell.  

415
00:28:42,821 --> 00:28:46,757
  Cool. They're just paranoid,  
        then. Coming up?        

416
00:28:46,792 --> 00:28:49,526
     Yeah. Just let me grab     
         some glasses.          

417
00:28:49,561 --> 00:28:51,929
            See you in a minute.

418
00:28:53,465 --> 00:28:55,365
             Fuck.              

419
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:57,167
                         Yo, yo.

420
00:28:57,202 --> 00:28:59,870
 Hey.                           

421
00:28:59,905 --> 00:29:02,339
So, what'd he say?              

422
00:29:02,374 --> 00:29:04,508
   - I got to pee.              
   -<i> Bathroom's right there.</i>    

423
00:29:04,543 --> 00:29:06,910
He didn't do it,                
just like I said.               

424
00:29:06,945 --> 00:29:09,446
- You don't believe him, do you?
-<i> Actually, I do.</i>               

425
00:29:09,481 --> 00:29:11,948
             Yeah, likely story,
             Dwayne.            

426
00:29:11,983 --> 00:29:15,118
  - So where's Mr. Clean now?   
  - He's right behind me.       

427
00:29:15,153 --> 00:29:17,087
Now can we please get back      
to the celebration?             

428
00:29:17,122 --> 00:29:18,989
 I hear that.                   

429
00:29:35,540 --> 00:29:38,542
        Damn! That fool         
        done cut the lights out.

430
00:29:38,577 --> 00:29:40,978
    ( overlapping chatter )     

431
00:29:45,884 --> 00:29:47,417
I'm getting me some out of here.

432
00:29:47,452 --> 00:29:49,052
        Malik: Oh, shit.        

433
00:29:53,291 --> 00:29:56,794
     Hey, what's going on?      

434
00:29:59,497 --> 00:30:01,365
       ( flushes toilet )       

435
00:30:04,436 --> 00:30:06,837
     Where'd everybody go?      

436
00:30:12,477 --> 00:30:14,044
         - ( bang )             
         - ( screams )          

437
00:30:17,148 --> 00:30:19,883
 Greg, if you're trying to get  
laid, this is not how to do it. 

438
00:30:22,988 --> 00:30:26,089
     Cut it out, you guys.      
       This isn't funny.        

439
00:30:27,559 --> 00:30:28,959
           You guys?            

440
00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:38,335
 Uhh. Why do I always do that?  

441
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:44,241
              Aah!              

442
00:30:44,276 --> 00:30:46,210
         ( screaming )          

443
00:30:51,082 --> 00:30:53,516
    - Did you hear that?        
    - I didn't hear nothing.    

444
00:30:53,551 --> 00:30:55,652
    - It sounded like Dapny.    
    - Dapny who?                

445
00:30:55,687 --> 00:30:58,021
      We can't just             
      leave her like that.      

446
00:30:58,056 --> 00:30:59,956
   That girl could be in        
   serious trouble up there.    

447
00:30:59,991 --> 00:31:01,992
- We have to help her.          
- Look, forget that "we" stuff. 

448
00:31:02,027 --> 00:31:04,261
Nobody told her                 
to stay behind.                 

449
00:31:04,296 --> 00:31:06,329
Besides, it's Greg's girlfriend,
so let him go get her.          

450
00:31:06,364 --> 00:31:08,365
           I never said that.   
           I never said that.   

451
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:10,367
           Wait a minute, y'all.
           Monica's right.      

452
00:31:10,402 --> 00:31:12,202
             We need to find out
             if she's okay.     

453
00:31:12,237 --> 00:31:15,071
Are you out of your mind?       

454
00:31:15,106 --> 00:31:18,541
   Fine. If y'all are willing   
       to have her death        
       on your conscious,       

455
00:31:18,576 --> 00:31:21,444
     then go ahead, leave,      

456
00:31:21,479 --> 00:31:25,182
  but I'm going back up there.  
   Who's gonna come with me?    

457
00:31:26,985 --> 00:31:28,285
          I don't see her, dawg.

458
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:30,353
 - Dapny?                       
 - What are you screaming for?  

459
00:31:30,388 --> 00:31:32,622
  Maybe she fell or something.  

460
00:31:32,657 --> 00:31:35,592
Why didn't you yell out, "Troy, 
over here. Come kill us, too"?  

461
00:31:35,627 --> 00:31:38,628
    Look, I say we leave now    
    while we're breathing.      

462
00:31:38,663 --> 00:31:40,597
      ( women screaming )       

463
00:31:43,001 --> 00:31:45,235
           Oh, damn.            

464
00:31:45,270 --> 00:31:46,403
           ( yells )            

465
00:31:46,438 --> 00:31:49,339
 Stacy:<i> Oh, my God. Oh, my God.</i> 

466
00:31:51,142 --> 00:31:53,176
       Get to the phone.        
       Get to the phone.        

467
00:31:53,211 --> 00:31:55,278
        Get to the car.         

468
00:31:55,313 --> 00:31:56,546
         Freida: Shit.          

469
00:31:56,581 --> 00:31:58,548
          To the car.           

470
00:31:58,583 --> 00:32:00,417
          Wait for me!          

471
00:32:14,065 --> 00:32:17,167
     Greg: Push over, guys.     

472
00:32:17,202 --> 00:32:19,102
            What does he mean by
            "who's next"?       

473
00:32:19,137 --> 00:32:21,738
Who cares?                      
Fire this up, Dwayne.           

474
00:32:21,773 --> 00:32:23,473
    - ( engine turns over )     
    - Dwayne:<i> Come on.</i>          

475
00:32:23,508 --> 00:32:25,241
    Freida:<i> Hold up, Dwayne.</i>    
     <i> Why aren't we moving?</i>     

476
00:32:25,276 --> 00:32:27,510
 I don't know.                  
 It won't turn over.            

477
00:32:27,545 --> 00:32:30,246
Maybe somebody should get out   
and look under the hood.        

478
00:32:30,281 --> 00:32:33,583
   Yeah, what about you, Johnny?
   Man, you know about cars.    

479
00:32:33,618 --> 00:32:36,553
Yeah, I sell cars. I don't know 
shit about fixing them.         

480
00:32:36,588 --> 00:32:38,154
It wouldn't matter anyways.     

481
00:32:38,189 --> 00:32:39,289
    You aren't even wearing     
    any fucking shoes.          

482
00:32:39,324 --> 00:32:41,658
        I know.                 
        My feet are killing me. 

483
00:32:41,693 --> 00:32:44,094
Oh, baby.                       

484
00:32:46,664 --> 00:32:50,667
       Oh, Jesus Christ.        
       Pop the hood. I'll do it.

485
00:33:00,578 --> 00:33:04,314
I can't see anything.           
I hope he's okay.               

486
00:33:04,349 --> 00:33:06,449
             Caprice,           
             I'm sure he's fine.

487
00:33:06,484 --> 00:33:09,252
       It's not like there's any
       wild animals out there.  

488
00:33:09,287 --> 00:33:12,255
  No, no, wild animals,         
  just Dwayne's psycho cousin.  

489
00:33:12,290 --> 00:33:14,458
What's he doing out there?      

490
00:33:18,596 --> 00:33:21,197
  What you trying to do, give us
  a heart attack or something?  

491
00:33:21,232 --> 00:33:23,233
    Sorry about that.           
    It's dark as hell out there.

492
00:33:23,268 --> 00:33:25,035
Look, are we ready              
to roll, or what?               

493
00:33:25,070 --> 00:33:26,469
               I don't think so.

494
00:33:26,504 --> 00:33:29,205
 The alternator cables have been
 cut on both the cars.          

495
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:30,540
            - What?             
            - Damn.             

496
00:33:30,575 --> 00:33:32,542
         Someone doesn't want us
         to leave.              

497
00:33:32,577 --> 00:33:33,743
        Caprice:<i> Oh, no,</i>        
     <i> what are we gonna do?</i>     

498
00:33:33,778 --> 00:33:36,179
Shit, Monica, I left my two-way 
in the house. You got yours?    

499
00:33:36,214 --> 00:33:37,814
                   No. I left it
                   in the room. 

500
00:33:37,849 --> 00:33:39,449
        Great. Now what?        

501
00:33:39,484 --> 00:33:42,285
 - Oh, wait, wait. I found it.  
 - Yes!                         

502
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:44,654
 - Okay, go and call the po-po. 
 - Shit.                        

503
00:33:44,689 --> 00:33:46,589
     <i> I can't get a signal.</i>     

504
00:33:46,624 --> 00:33:48,391
     Dwayne:<i> Yo, try email.</i>     
    <i> Maybe that still works.</i>    

505
00:33:48,426 --> 00:33:50,627
        Good idea. I'm gonna try
        to email my assistant.  

506
00:33:50,662 --> 00:33:52,195
       <i> All right, cool.</i>        

507
00:33:52,230 --> 00:33:54,764
All right, y'all, the way       
I see it, we got two options.   

508
00:33:54,799 --> 00:33:57,300
One, we try to make it back     
to the nearest cabin.           

509
00:33:57,335 --> 00:33:58,835
That's 10 miles away.           

510
00:33:58,870 --> 00:34:01,604
 Please.                        
 It's dark outside.             

511
00:34:01,639 --> 00:34:05,308
Or we take our chances,         
go back in the house,           

512
00:34:05,343 --> 00:34:06,676
 and wait for help.             

513
00:34:06,711 --> 00:34:09,612
No way. I'm not going back      
in there with that maniac.      

514
00:34:09,647 --> 00:34:10,847
    I ain't staying in here.    

515
00:34:10,882 --> 00:34:13,283
    Look, Dwayne, you guys      
    brought us all up here.     

516
00:34:13,318 --> 00:34:15,251
     This is your problem,      
     so fix it.                 

517
00:34:15,286 --> 00:34:16,786
Why you always trying to do--   

518
00:34:16,821 --> 00:34:19,289
   Look, why are we sitting here
   pointing fingers, huh?       

519
00:34:19,324 --> 00:34:22,392
      <i> Now, we can't help</i>       
        <i> what happened.</i>         

520
00:34:22,427 --> 00:34:25,528
       What we need to do is    
       focus on what to do next.

521
00:34:25,563 --> 00:34:27,864
          And that is?          

522
00:34:27,899 --> 00:34:31,801
<i> Survive. The storm is supposed</i> 
   <i> to break in the morning.</i>    

523
00:34:31,836 --> 00:34:35,505
      I say we head back inside 
      and wait it out till then.

524
00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:38,441
    - You call that a plan?     
 - You got a better one, Stacy? 

525
00:34:38,476 --> 00:34:41,144
             Actually, I think  
             that's a good idea.

526
00:34:41,179 --> 00:34:43,580
            If we stay in here, 
            we're sitting ducks.

527
00:34:43,615 --> 00:34:46,316
        Exactly. Come on, y'all.
        Troy's only one person. 

528
00:34:46,351 --> 00:34:48,384
          He can't kill us all. 

529
00:34:48,419 --> 00:34:50,887
       We're safe as long as    
       we stick together, y'all.

530
00:34:50,922 --> 00:34:54,624
Thank you. Finally somebody's   
using their brain.              

531
00:34:54,659 --> 00:34:57,260
Yeah, okay, whatever.           
Let's just do something, please.

532
00:34:57,295 --> 00:35:00,697
Then it's decided. We find      
a place to wait and hide.       

533
00:35:00,732 --> 00:35:02,299
Push comes to shove...          

534
00:35:04,335 --> 00:35:05,735
I got something for him.        

535
00:35:14,879 --> 00:35:15,845
         What was that?         

536
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:17,814
            - What?             
            - What?             

537
00:35:17,849 --> 00:35:19,449
Girl, don't start               
with this stuff.                

538
00:35:19,484 --> 00:35:21,251
       No, I really heard       
       something.               

539
00:35:21,286 --> 00:35:22,785
       It was coming from       
       over here I think.       

540
00:35:22,820 --> 00:35:26,656
 It was making a ticking sound, 
 you know, like tick-tock.      

541
00:35:26,691 --> 00:35:29,459
           Tick-tock.           

542
00:35:29,494 --> 00:35:32,529
   - Tick-tock like a clock.    
   -<i> Yes, exactly like a--</i>      

543
00:35:33,765 --> 00:35:35,865
             Sorry.             

544
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:38,668
Ooh, you're getting on          
my last nerves. You know what?  

545
00:35:38,703 --> 00:35:41,304
  - I'm sorry.                  
  - Everybody just stay calm.   

546
00:35:41,339 --> 00:35:43,273
   Stacy: Can we just get       
   to the game room, please?    

547
00:35:43,308 --> 00:35:44,908
Okay. Before we go              
any further,                    

548
00:35:44,943 --> 00:35:46,776
let's make sure                 
everybody's here.               

549
00:35:46,811 --> 00:35:50,380
So when I yell out your name,   
just yell "check," okay?        

550
00:35:50,415 --> 00:35:52,849
    - Freida?                   
    - ( indistinct chatter )    

551
00:35:52,884 --> 00:35:54,618
"Check" is fine, Freida.        

552
00:35:55,887 --> 00:35:57,787
           - Caprice?           
           - Check.             

553
00:35:57,822 --> 00:35:59,522
            - Malik.            
            - Here.             

554
00:35:59,557 --> 00:36:01,457
           - Johnny?            
           - Present.           

555
00:36:01,492 --> 00:36:03,259
 - Stacy?                       
 - Don't be ridiculous, Monica. 

556
00:36:03,294 --> 00:36:05,461
   What are we, preschoolers?   

557
00:36:05,496 --> 00:36:07,363
      Freida: can you just      
      say "check"? Damn.        

558
00:36:07,398 --> 00:36:10,233
All right, check.               
Happy now?                      

559
00:36:10,268 --> 00:36:11,901
           Thank you.           
           Dwayne?              

560
00:36:11,936 --> 00:36:13,803
          Yeah, baby.           

561
00:36:13,838 --> 00:36:16,472
   - Greg?                      
   - ( whispers ) Yeah, here.   

562
00:36:16,507 --> 00:36:19,242
    Okay, everybody's here.     

563
00:36:19,277 --> 00:36:21,811
     <i> Wait. What about me?</i>      

564
00:36:21,846 --> 00:36:24,447
            Why y'all act like  
            y'all just saw O.J.?

565
00:36:24,482 --> 00:36:27,184
        ( women scream )        

566
00:36:42,467 --> 00:36:44,834
            Johnny.             

567
00:36:44,869 --> 00:36:46,570
           Oh, shit.            

568
00:36:51,542 --> 00:36:54,377
We made it. We're alive.        
We're alive.                    

569
00:36:54,412 --> 00:36:56,346
     Freida: We gonna die.      

570
00:36:56,381 --> 00:36:59,015
No, not if we maintain          
our composure.                  

571
00:36:59,050 --> 00:37:01,684
              We can't panic.   
              Do you understand?

572
00:37:01,719 --> 00:37:04,254
       - We can't panic.        
       - Caprice:<i> Johnny?</i>       

573
00:37:04,289 --> 00:37:06,823
                 Oh, my God,    
                 where's Johnny?

574
00:37:06,858 --> 00:37:10,393
  No, no, Johnny!               

575
00:37:10,428 --> 00:37:13,396
Caprice, just calm down, okay?  
I'm sure Johnny's all right.    

576
00:37:13,431 --> 00:37:16,666
        No, he's not. He's dead.
        I know he's dead.       

577
00:37:16,701 --> 00:37:19,869
   - He's not dead, Caprice.    
   - ( mutters )                

578
00:37:19,904 --> 00:37:23,640
Oh, my God, Dwayne. You have to 
go out there and find Johnny.   

579
00:37:23,675 --> 00:37:25,808
   Caprice, I think             
   that's a good idea, okay?    

580
00:37:25,843 --> 00:37:29,512
  Look, Johnny's a smart guy.   
  He knows where we are.        

581
00:37:29,547 --> 00:37:33,916
   We'll find him. He's probably
   just hiding out right now.   

582
00:37:33,951 --> 00:37:37,287
Come on, in the meantime,       
I suggest that we all settle in 

583
00:37:37,322 --> 00:37:39,722
    and try to remain calm.     

584
00:37:39,757 --> 00:37:41,391
        Come on,                
        can you do that?        

585
00:37:41,426 --> 00:37:43,793
        I promise you...        

586
00:37:43,828 --> 00:37:46,829
     He's gonna show up,        
     all right? I promise.      

587
00:37:46,864 --> 00:37:50,634
( sobs ) Oh, Johnny.            

588
00:38:02,747 --> 00:38:04,981
        How much longer         
     are we gonna sit here?     

589
00:38:05,016 --> 00:38:07,717
         Until the storm breaks,
         Greg.                  

590
00:38:07,752 --> 00:38:10,353
It's been over half an hour     
since we heard anything,        

591
00:38:10,388 --> 00:38:11,854
     <i> and I'm going crazy.</i>      

592
00:38:11,889 --> 00:38:14,324
      Go get us some food, then,
      'cause I'm starving.      

593
00:38:14,359 --> 00:38:15,525
How could you possibly          

594
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:18,027
think of eating                 
at a time like this, Freida?    

595
00:38:18,062 --> 00:38:19,629
             Because I'm hungry.

596
00:38:19,664 --> 00:38:22,465
              And besides, I got
              a fast metabolism.

597
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:26,336
Oh, so that's the problem.      

598
00:38:26,371 --> 00:38:28,504
 <i> Look, y'all, Freida's right.</i>  

599
00:38:28,539 --> 00:38:31,007
By the looks of the storm,      
we're gonna be here for a while.

600
00:38:31,042 --> 00:38:32,909
          We need to find Johnny
          and get some supplies.

601
00:38:32,944 --> 00:38:34,744
      <i> ( thunder rumbling )</i>     

602
00:38:41,452 --> 00:38:43,920
     Who's coming with me?      

603
00:38:43,955 --> 00:38:45,088
          Honestly, I'd go, D...

604
00:38:45,123 --> 00:38:47,123
          ( indistinct chatter )

605
00:38:47,158 --> 00:38:49,392
          Greg. Greg.           

606
00:38:49,427 --> 00:38:50,927
   Me?                          

607
00:38:50,962 --> 00:38:54,897
Can I get back to you           
on that?                        

608
00:38:54,932 --> 00:38:56,933
   Damn, I'm not going          
   back out there by myself,    

609
00:38:56,968 --> 00:38:59,569
    and one of y'all need       
    to stay with the ladies,    
    so who's it gonna be?       

610
00:39:02,507 --> 00:39:04,073
                I'll go, Dwayne.

611
00:39:04,108 --> 00:39:07,543
 - This is pitiful, man.        
 - Hold on, Monica, I'm coming. 

612
00:39:07,578 --> 00:39:10,813
   Wait, Malik. You don't have  
   to prove anything to anybody.

613
00:39:10,848 --> 00:39:13,683
Stacy, look, I'm                
a grown-ass man, all right?     

614
00:39:13,718 --> 00:39:16,552
          Really? So why are you
          shaking, then?        

615
00:39:16,587 --> 00:39:19,088
     Let's go, D.               
     Let's go find Johnny.      

616
00:39:19,123 --> 00:39:20,957
Maybe if I run into Troy,       

617
00:39:20,992 --> 00:39:23,025
maybe I can get him to do me    
a special request.              

618
00:39:23,060 --> 00:39:24,460
                   Funny, Malik.

619
00:39:24,495 --> 00:39:27,397
You guys, be careful, okay?     

620
00:39:27,432 --> 00:39:29,031
      ( cell phone rings )      

621
00:39:29,066 --> 00:39:30,800
      - Wait, wait.             
        Maybe that's Hope.      
      - What?                   

622
00:39:33,738 --> 00:39:34,937
        - That's weird.         
        - Dwayne:<i> What?</i>         

623
00:39:34,972 --> 00:39:37,407
           All it says          
           is "picture loading."

624
00:39:37,442 --> 00:39:39,976
        ( women scream )        

625
00:39:40,011 --> 00:39:41,711
          Oh, my gosh!          

626

     <i> ( chainsaw revving  )</i>     

627
00:39:53,458 --> 00:39:54,791
       Shoot him, Dwayne.       

628
00:39:54,826 --> 00:39:57,627
   I can't! My gun's jammed!    
   Haul ass!                    

629
00:40:00,731 --> 00:40:03,132
        Get in the room.        

630
00:40:03,167 --> 00:40:04,133
     <i> ( chainsaw revving )</i>      

631
00:40:04,168 --> 00:40:06,669
       Run, Caprice. Run.       

632
00:40:06,704 --> 00:40:08,004
              Aah!              

633
00:40:15,213 --> 00:40:17,780
   -<i> What are you doing?! </i>      
   - He was outside the door.   

634
00:40:17,815 --> 00:40:19,582
           It's Caprice, though.
           Let her in.          

635
00:40:19,617 --> 00:40:21,617
Wait, we don't know that        
for sure.                       

636
00:40:21,652 --> 00:40:23,820
       Well, wait.              
       What should we do?       

637
00:40:23,855 --> 00:40:27,223
What do you mean? It's Caprice! 
Let her in. Move, Stacy.        

638
00:40:27,258 --> 00:40:29,725
   - What, you gonna move me?   
   - Get back.                  

639
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:33,196
Shh. Uh, quiet.                 

640
00:40:33,231 --> 00:40:36,566
 Caprice, are you still there?  

641
00:40:36,601 --> 00:40:38,635
      ( thunder crashes )       

642
00:40:54,952 --> 00:40:57,754
     - ( chainsaw starts )      
     - Aah!                     

643
00:40:59,757 --> 00:41:02,625
    - Caprice?                  
    -<i> That's it. Stand back.</i>    

644
00:41:02,660 --> 00:41:04,694
      Everybody get back.       

645
00:41:10,535 --> 00:41:12,902
      - Dwayne:<i> Damn it. </i>       
      - What's up?              

646
00:41:12,937 --> 00:41:14,871
          Oh, my God.           

647
00:41:14,906 --> 00:41:16,772
         It's Caprice.          
    Get away from the door.     

648
00:41:16,807 --> 00:41:18,941
Back away from the door, baby.  
Back away from the door.        

649
00:41:18,976 --> 00:41:21,043
        You killed her.         

650
00:41:21,078 --> 00:41:23,746
He was right outside the door.  
What was I supposed to do?      

651
00:41:23,781 --> 00:41:25,281
               Help your friend.

652
00:41:25,316 --> 00:41:28,551
Yeah. That's kind of hard to do 
when you're dead, Monica.       

653
00:41:28,586 --> 00:41:30,686
   Freida:<i> Look, she's right.</i>   
   <i> If we had let Troy in...</i>    

654
00:41:30,721 --> 00:41:33,089
    <i> he probably would have</i>     
        <i> killed us all.</i>         

655
00:41:33,124 --> 00:41:35,024
  - Does have a point, Monica.  
  - ( cell phone rings )        

656

          Aah. Oh, no.          

657
00:41:36,827 --> 00:41:38,761
               Baby, what is it?

658
00:41:38,796 --> 00:41:42,164
    It's Troy again.            
    He asking, "Who's next?"    

659
00:41:42,199 --> 00:41:44,033
         Dwayne:<i> Shit!</i>          

660
00:41:44,068 --> 00:41:46,536
 How did he get                 
 your phone number, anyway?     

661
00:41:46,571 --> 00:41:48,704
Dwayne probably gave it to him. 
Ain't that right, Dwayne?       

662
00:41:48,739 --> 00:41:51,641
   All right, that's enough,    
   Stacy. All right?            

663
00:41:51,676 --> 00:41:53,843
 So what's our next move, man?  

664
00:41:53,878 --> 00:41:55,912
         I don't know, man.     
         I don't know right now.

665
00:41:55,947 --> 00:41:58,681
Why is he doing this?           

666
00:41:58,716 --> 00:42:02,251
       Ain't it obvious? He's   
       getting rid of witnesses.

667
00:42:02,286 --> 00:42:05,254
   We're the only ones who could
   bring him to justice.        

668
00:42:05,289 --> 00:42:07,056
No, man. Something's wrong.     

669
00:42:07,091 --> 00:42:08,791
       I'm telling y'all,       
     Troy is not a killer.      

670
00:42:08,826 --> 00:42:10,626
  Okay, well, who else          
  could it be, then?            

671
00:42:10,661 --> 00:42:12,728
             Wait. Wait. I know.

672
00:42:12,763 --> 00:42:14,263
Who?                            

673
00:42:14,298 --> 00:42:16,866
       Maybe it's the Boogeyman.

674
00:42:16,901 --> 00:42:18,801
Stacy, baby.                    

675
00:42:18,836 --> 00:42:22,138
    Right, Dwayne? Because      
    it couldn't possibly be     

676
00:42:22,173 --> 00:42:24,707
the only person                 
unaccounted for in the house.   

677
00:42:24,742 --> 00:42:26,275
Oh, no, that would just         
make too much sense.            

678
00:42:26,310 --> 00:42:27,843
       Oh, Stacy, please.       

679
00:42:27,878 --> 00:42:30,046
           Look, I know what it 
           seems like right now,

680
00:42:30,081 --> 00:42:32,915
       but I cannot wrap my mind
       around the situation.    

681
00:42:32,950 --> 00:42:35,818
Really? Okay, why don't you     
tell that to Dapny?             

682
00:42:35,853 --> 00:42:37,086
No, better yet, Dwayne,         

683
00:42:37,121 --> 00:42:39,822
why don't you go                
and talk to Johnny or Caprice   
for that matter                 

684
00:42:39,857 --> 00:42:42,692
After all, you are              
somewhat responsible.           

685
00:42:42,727 --> 00:42:44,627
                  Stacy, I said 
                  that's enough.

686
00:42:44,662 --> 00:42:47,129
Stacy, it's my fault, okay.     
If you want to blame anybody,   
blame me.                       

687
00:42:47,164 --> 00:42:49,131
I was the one who told Troy     
he could come.                  

688
00:42:49,166 --> 00:42:51,133
    Monica, don't try to take   
    the blame for me, all right?

689
00:42:51,168 --> 00:42:52,902
               You don't have to
               stick up for me. 

690
00:42:52,937 --> 00:42:54,937
         It's half my decision  
         as much as it is yours.

691
00:42:54,972 --> 00:42:57,173
      As for Stacy, if you      
      don't like my suggestions,

692
00:42:57,208 --> 00:42:59,642
    you're more than welcome    
    to leave. The door is there.

693
00:42:59,677 --> 00:43:01,911
      ( thunder rumbles )       

694
00:43:01,946 --> 00:43:03,879
          That's what I thought.

695
00:43:03,914 --> 00:43:06,682
Now, if you can't come up with  
something to help us,           

696
00:43:06,717 --> 00:43:10,686
then I suggest                  
you chill the fuck out.         

697
00:43:10,721 --> 00:43:13,623
      Hey, y'all, I got an idea.

698
00:43:13,658 --> 00:43:15,324
    Why don't we flip the script

699
00:43:15,359 --> 00:43:17,393
            and become          
            the hunters instead?

700
00:43:17,428 --> 00:43:19,061
     No, seriously, Malik?      

701
00:43:19,096 --> 00:43:22,198
Stacy, just hear me out         
on this one, all right?         

702
00:43:22,233 --> 00:43:25,334
Now, the ball is in             
Troy's court now, right?        

703
00:43:25,369 --> 00:43:27,370
He's controlling the game.      

704
00:43:27,405 --> 00:43:30,640
He's got our backs to the wall, 
and he knows that we're afraid. 

705
00:43:30,675 --> 00:43:33,075
        No shit, Kojak.         
        Why don't you tell us   
        something we don't know?

706
00:43:33,110 --> 00:43:35,411
 So what do you want us to do,  
 go after Troy?                 

707
00:43:35,446 --> 00:43:37,246
        - Yeah, why not?        
        - ( mutters )           

708
00:43:37,281 --> 00:43:38,347
Aw, come on, y'all.             

709
00:43:38,382 --> 00:43:39,715
             Malik, hold on now.

710
00:43:39,750 --> 00:43:42,018
                Yo, Malik's     
                on to something.

711
00:43:42,053 --> 00:43:44,120
                I'm telling you,
                think about it. 

712
00:43:44,155 --> 00:43:46,989
      The last think Troy       
      would expect is an ambush.

713
00:43:47,024 --> 00:43:50,259
        He's probably sitting   
        relaxing thinking we're 
        all cornered and scared.

714
00:43:50,294 --> 00:43:53,796
Exactly, y'all. We can lure him 
into the open and jump him.     

715
00:43:53,831 --> 00:43:56,032
    Ha ha. Sounds               
    fucking brilliant, guys.    

716
00:43:56,067 --> 00:43:58,868
      Let me know how           
      it turns out, okay?       

717
00:43:58,903 --> 00:44:01,270
      Don't sweat it, man. Look,
      if we're gonna do this... 

718
00:44:01,305 --> 00:44:03,072
   we're gonna need something   
   that's gonna lure him out.   

719
00:44:03,107 --> 00:44:05,241
       We need some bait        
       that gets him out.       

720
00:44:05,276 --> 00:44:09,111
   -<i> What are we gonna</i>          
   <i>  use as bait? </i>              
   - Something he likes, man.   

721
00:44:09,146 --> 00:44:11,814
    Uch, you must be hitting    
    the pipe with both hands    

722
00:44:11,849 --> 00:44:13,916
   if you think I'm gonna go    
   for some mess like this.     

723
00:44:13,951 --> 00:44:15,718
       Come on, Freida,         
       it's virtually foolproof.

724
00:44:15,753 --> 00:44:17,319
     Yeah, and I ain't the fool.

725
00:44:17,354 --> 00:44:19,321
We'll be with you the whole     
step of the way, all right?     

726
00:44:19,356 --> 00:44:21,390
Every step of the way,          
we'll be right there with you.  

727
00:44:21,425 --> 00:44:24,360
Now, once he gets too close,    
bam, we will blast his ass.     

728
00:44:24,395 --> 00:44:25,861
             It'll work, Freida.

729
00:44:25,896 --> 00:44:27,697
             Who do I look like,
             Dwayne, Boo Boo?   

730
00:44:27,732 --> 00:44:29,365
      I ain't leaving this room,

731
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:32,334
    and there's nothing you can 
    say or do to change my mind.

732
00:44:32,369 --> 00:44:34,837
             Absolutely,        
             positively nothing.

733
00:44:37,842 --> 00:44:39,809
        Now, you sure this check
        ain't gonna bounce      

734
00:44:39,844 --> 00:44:41,877
          when I try to cash it,
          right?                

735
00:44:41,912 --> 00:44:44,246
  - Freida, you have my word.   
  - Mm-hmm.                     

736
00:44:44,281 --> 00:44:47,316
     Look, I found some burgers.
     We're in business now.     

737
00:44:47,351 --> 00:44:50,219
All right, run this by me again 
to make sure I'm clear.         

738
00:44:50,254 --> 00:44:52,021
        All right, look,        
    you're gonna stay here.     

739
00:44:52,056 --> 00:44:55,157
   <i> Malik and I, we're gonna</i>    
  <i> go over behind the counter.</i>  

740
00:44:55,192 --> 00:44:57,026
      When Troy comes in,       
   just try to distract him.    

741
00:44:57,061 --> 00:44:59,962
-<i> We'll take care of the rest. </i> 
- What if something go wrong?   

742
00:44:59,997 --> 00:45:01,330
 Come on, Freida, ain't nothing 
      gonna happen, baby.       

743
00:45:01,365 --> 00:45:03,466
          <i> We got you.</i>          

744
00:45:03,501 --> 00:45:06,969
  Now look, I'm trusting you    
  to use this if you have to.   

745
00:45:07,004 --> 00:45:08,838
            Mm-hmm.             

746
00:45:08,873 --> 00:45:11,040
                     Whoa, whoa.

747
00:45:11,075 --> 00:45:12,341
Good luck.                      

748
00:45:12,376 --> 00:45:13,776
                      All right.

749
00:45:37,134 --> 00:45:40,069
      Hey, Monica, could we talk
      for a second?             

750
00:45:40,104 --> 00:45:42,404
What is it, Greg?               

751
00:45:42,439 --> 00:45:45,107
        Monica, I know you think
        I came up here          

752
00:45:45,142 --> 00:45:47,810
      <i> to get you to sign</i>       
        <i> that contract.</i>         

753
00:45:47,845 --> 00:45:49,845
  Now it's as if looking death  
          in the face           

754
00:45:49,880 --> 00:45:52,381
   has given me an entire new   
     appreciation for life.     

755
00:45:52,416 --> 00:45:55,050
      I mean, this whole        
      fucked-up nightmare       

756
00:45:55,085 --> 00:45:58,954
      has made me realize       
       what's important.        

757
00:45:58,989 --> 00:46:02,491
  You. You're important to me.  

758
00:46:02,526 --> 00:46:06,061
   You really have no shame,    
            do you?             

759
00:46:06,096 --> 00:46:07,897
    No, Monica, I'm serious.    

760
00:46:07,932 --> 00:46:09,832
         I consider us          
  more than business partners.  

761
00:46:09,867 --> 00:46:12,001
  <i> I mean, we're like family.</i>   

762
00:46:12,036 --> 00:46:13,869
       <i> I'm your brother</i>        
     <i> from another mother.</i>      

763
00:46:13,904 --> 00:46:16,405
     Oh, stop there, Greg.      

764
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:19,375
    The answer is still no.     

765
00:46:19,410 --> 00:46:22,945
          Monica, please.       
          I'm begging, pleading.

766
00:46:22,980 --> 00:46:26,816
            Don't do this to me.
            We need each other. 

767
00:46:26,851 --> 00:46:29,385
No, Greg.                       
What is wrong with you?         

768
00:46:29,420 --> 00:46:32,855
  In case you haven't noticed,  
 there's a psycho in the house, 

769
00:46:32,890 --> 00:46:35,090
  and he's trying to kill us.   

770
00:46:35,125 --> 00:46:38,327
   The last thing on my mind    
      is that stupid show       

771
00:46:38,362 --> 00:46:40,062
     or your damn contract.     

772
00:46:40,097 --> 00:46:43,065
          Now, please,          
      just leave me alone.      

773
00:46:44,335 --> 00:46:48,370
    Okay. We'll talk later.     

774
00:46:48,405 --> 00:46:51,841
          ( sizzling )          

775
00:46:51,876 --> 00:46:53,209
        - Are we ready?         
        - Yeah.                 

776
00:46:53,244 --> 00:46:55,444
      - Freida, you cool?       
      - Mm.                     

777
00:46:55,479 --> 00:46:57,613
         Now look, you see Troy,

778
00:46:57,648 --> 00:47:00,015
        remember to say his name
        loud and clear.         

779
00:47:00,050 --> 00:47:01,851
      <i> That's the signal.</i>       

780
00:47:01,886 --> 00:47:03,285
     All right, I got you.      

781
00:47:03,320 --> 00:47:05,855
      ( thunder rumbles )       

782
00:47:09,460 --> 00:47:12,028
     Man, this better work.     

783
00:47:15,666 --> 00:47:18,033
    Happy birthday to you     

784
00:47:18,068 --> 00:47:19,301
              Me              

785
00:47:19,336 --> 00:47:22,304
     Happy birthday to me     

786
00:47:22,339 --> 00:47:24,640
       It's my birthday,       
       it's my birth--         

787
00:47:24,675 --> 00:47:26,309
       It's my birthday       

788
00:47:32,516 --> 00:47:35,384
     Hold up. Aw, hell, no.     

789
00:47:35,419 --> 00:47:38,855
    I know you ain't trying     
       to eat without me.       

790
00:47:41,558 --> 00:47:43,392
        ( hinges creak )        

791
00:47:48,132 --> 00:47:51,901
Yo, Freida,                     
you see anything?               

792
00:47:51,936 --> 00:47:55,004
       Mnh-mnh, not yet.        

793
00:47:55,039 --> 00:47:58,173
  So you still think            
  your cousin's innocent, huh?  

794
00:47:58,208 --> 00:48:00,242
I'm not so sure anymore.        

795
00:48:00,277 --> 00:48:03,178
       Them burgers smell gooder
       than a motherfucker.     

796
00:48:03,213 --> 00:48:05,915
  <i> You ain't never lie, dawg.</i>   

797
00:48:05,950 --> 00:48:08,050
           Yo, Freida, look out!

798
00:48:09,653 --> 00:48:11,320
          ( screams )           

799
00:48:14,658 --> 00:48:16,959
      That's what you get       
 for messing with Miss Freida.  

800
00:48:25,502 --> 00:48:27,904
      <i> ( thunder rumbles )</i>      

801
00:48:48,058 --> 00:48:49,658
You okay, baby?                 

802
00:48:49,693 --> 00:48:52,295
          ( grunts ) Not really.

803
00:48:54,365 --> 00:48:58,067
Look, I know this might not     
make you feel any better,       

804
00:48:58,102 --> 00:49:01,203
but at least we're still here,  

805
00:49:01,238 --> 00:49:03,572
and at least                    
we have each other.             

806
00:49:06,777 --> 00:49:09,011
           I just don't know why
           he did it, Monica.   

807
00:49:09,046 --> 00:49:11,280
     This ain't like Troy.      

808
00:49:14,018 --> 00:49:16,185
Why don't you just go ask him?  

809
00:49:27,064 --> 00:49:28,464
   ( door opens and closes )    

810
00:49:28,499 --> 00:49:31,033
     ( footsteps approach )     

811
00:49:42,746 --> 00:49:45,781
- Looking for this?             
- Ach. Thank God it's you, man. 

812
00:49:45,816 --> 00:49:48,150
Come on, help me                
untie these ropes.              

813
00:49:48,185 --> 00:49:50,552
        - Can't do that.        
        - How come, man?        

814
00:49:50,587 --> 00:49:52,554
Come on, we cousins.            
Why you being like this?        

815
00:49:52,589 --> 00:49:54,490
     Don't try to play me.      
You know what the fuck you did. 

816
00:49:54,525 --> 00:49:56,525
          I don't know          
    what you talking about.     

817
00:49:56,560 --> 00:49:58,694
    The killings. You killed    
 that girl and half my friends. 

818
00:49:58,729 --> 00:50:01,030
   - Why?                       
   - For the millionth time.    

819
00:50:01,065 --> 00:50:03,265
I didn't kill nobody, man.      
You got to believe me.          

820
00:50:03,300 --> 00:50:06,468
    How do you explain your face
    on the 11:00 news           
    as a wanted murderer?       

821
00:50:06,503 --> 00:50:09,204
That's all K.D., man.           

822
00:50:09,239 --> 00:50:11,240
        Thought you said        
   you didn't know him, Troy.   

823
00:50:11,275 --> 00:50:13,409
Okay, I lied,                   
but I ain't kill nobody.        

824
00:50:13,444 --> 00:50:17,813
We was all chillin'.            
It was all good.                

825
00:50:17,848 --> 00:50:20,816
K.D. got real hot.              
He started trippin' 'cause      
Shorty wouldn't let him hit it. 

826
00:50:20,851 --> 00:50:23,385
    <i> I told him to be cool.</i>     
    <i> He don't listen to me.</i>     

827
00:50:23,420 --> 00:50:25,654
Then I turned around,           
he was stabbing her, man.       

828
00:50:25,689 --> 00:50:28,590
And he kept stabbing her,       
and I got scared, so I bounced. 

829
00:50:28,625 --> 00:50:30,426
        You so innocent,        
 why don't we go to the police? 

830
00:50:30,461 --> 00:50:32,294
'Cause K.D. and his people      
ain't no joke.                  

831
00:50:32,329 --> 00:50:35,597
See, I'm not safely tucked away 
in the hill like you, bro.      

832
00:50:35,632 --> 00:50:37,366
I'm on the streets.             

833
00:50:37,401 --> 00:50:38,600
As soon as word got out         
that I snitched,                

834
00:50:38,635 --> 00:50:41,603
then lights out,                
I ain't going out like that.    

835
00:50:41,638 --> 00:50:44,373
So I figured I just hide out    
until they caught him.          

836
00:50:44,408 --> 00:50:46,742
I never thought they was        
gonna finger me, too.           

837
00:50:46,777 --> 00:50:50,345
  You talk a good game, Troy.   
   I ain't buying your shit.    

838
00:50:50,380 --> 00:50:52,214
         You going down for what
         you did here tonight.  

839
00:50:52,249 --> 00:50:54,616
I didn't do nothing.            
I swear, man.                   

840
00:50:54,651 --> 00:50:56,518
  How do you explain this gun   
        I found on you?         

841
00:50:56,553 --> 00:50:58,720
I stole that from K.D., man,    
for protection.                 

842
00:50:58,755 --> 00:51:00,789
   What about you trying to     
   attack Freida in the kitchen?

843
00:51:00,824 --> 00:51:03,725
I was after the burgers, man.   
I was hungry.                   

844
00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:06,728
 Oh, yeah? And what's this, huh?
      Huh? What's all this?     

845
00:51:06,763 --> 00:51:08,797
       Man, homeboy rich.       
 He ain't gonna miss that shit. 

846
00:51:08,832 --> 00:51:10,799
      Why is it every time      
    something bad goes down,    

847
00:51:10,834 --> 00:51:14,103
          your ass ain't nowhere
          to be found?          

848
00:51:14,138 --> 00:51:16,271
Okay, I'm gonna be honest.      

849
00:51:16,306 --> 00:51:19,241
I been kind of                  
robbing the place,              

850
00:51:19,276 --> 00:51:22,878
but I swear on my mama, I never 
killed nobody in my life.       

851
00:51:22,913 --> 00:51:26,415
On the real, though,            
you need to talk to your girl.  

852
00:51:26,450 --> 00:51:27,883
          Who? Monica?          

853
00:51:27,918 --> 00:51:31,386
Hell, yeah, I saw her dragging  
Caprice down the hallway.       

854
00:51:31,421 --> 00:51:34,289
 - What you trying to say, man? 
 - I caught her red-handed.     
   It was her!                  

855
00:51:34,324 --> 00:51:37,326
   - What you trying to say?    
   - She didn't see me.         

856
00:51:37,361 --> 00:51:40,596
You trippin', man.              
You trippin'.                   

857
00:51:40,631 --> 00:51:43,232
     Get out of here, man,      

858
00:51:43,267 --> 00:51:46,468
before I'm the one that's end up
       wanted for murder.       

859
00:51:46,503 --> 00:51:50,739
 Yo, Dwayne, I'm innocent, man. 
     You got to believe me.     

860
00:51:50,774 --> 00:51:52,408
     Tell it to the police.     

861
00:51:54,878 --> 00:51:58,347
    Dwayne, it was her, man.    

862
00:52:01,852 --> 00:52:03,419
          ( mutters )           

863
00:52:17,501 --> 00:52:23,272
 We shall overcome            

864
00:52:23,307 --> 00:52:28,710
  We shall overcome           

865
00:52:28,745 --> 00:52:31,847
   You know what? Keep it up,   
     and I will come over.      

866
00:52:31,882 --> 00:52:34,283
          ( chuckles )          

867
00:52:36,653 --> 00:52:38,520
 Kumbaya...                   

868
00:52:38,555 --> 00:52:40,255
         Greg, shut up.         

869
00:52:40,290 --> 00:52:44,726
   Yes, please. Shut up.        

870
00:52:44,761 --> 00:52:47,429
       Look, I'm getting worried
       about Dwayne.            

871
00:52:47,464 --> 00:52:49,731
   - Malik, could you just--    
         - Say no more.         

872
00:52:49,766 --> 00:52:51,366
        I'm on the case.        

873
00:52:51,401 --> 00:52:52,734
         - Yo, Freida.          
         -<i> Yeah.</i>                

874
00:52:52,769 --> 00:52:55,304
 - Can I have the gun, please?  
 - Unh-unh, my brother.         

875
00:52:55,339 --> 00:52:57,706
   You gots to get your own.    

876
00:52:57,741 --> 00:53:01,743
Guess it's official. Everybody's
     lost they damn minds.      

877
00:53:01,778 --> 00:53:05,414
       -<i> Malik. </i>                
       - What now, Stacy?       

878
00:53:05,449 --> 00:53:08,884
                Would you please
                be careful?     

879
00:53:10,587 --> 00:53:12,655
I'll be fine.                   

880
00:53:27,971 --> 00:53:29,905
          Yo, Dwayne.           

881
00:53:29,940 --> 00:53:32,208
       You in here, man?        

882
00:53:34,911 --> 00:53:36,979
               D.               

883
00:53:42,719 --> 00:53:43,919
            Dwayne.             

884
00:53:46,490 --> 00:53:48,324
               D.               

885
00:53:50,460 --> 00:53:52,795
        Oh, shit. Fuck.         

886
00:54:12,749 --> 00:54:16,285
  God, please give us a break.  

887
00:54:25,996 --> 00:54:27,463
          Looking out.          

888
00:54:40,377 --> 00:54:42,044
          Keys. Keys.           

889
00:54:43,780 --> 00:54:45,514
            Jackpot.            

890
00:54:45,549 --> 00:54:47,349
      Start, baby, start.       

891
00:54:47,384 --> 00:54:48,450
       ( engine starts )        

892
00:54:48,485 --> 00:54:50,319
        Yeah. Ha ha ha.         

893
00:54:51,755 --> 00:54:53,922
            Girl...             

894
00:54:58,862 --> 00:55:00,996
  Hey.                          

895
00:55:01,031 --> 00:55:04,733
You okay?                       

896
00:55:04,768 --> 00:55:06,501
                   I don't know.

897
00:55:06,536 --> 00:55:09,738
 It just seems like every time  
 something good happens to me,  

898
00:55:09,773 --> 00:55:11,740
         something bad          
   has to happen to me, too.    

899
00:55:13,577 --> 00:55:16,712
      I mean, one minute,       

900
00:55:16,747 --> 00:55:20,849
     it's the happiest day      
          of my life,           

901
00:55:20,884 --> 00:55:22,951
      then the next minute,     
     I'm running for my life?   

902
00:55:22,986 --> 00:55:25,454
   I don't know how much more   
      I can take of this.       

903
00:55:25,489 --> 00:55:27,823
What are you                    
talking about, Monica?          

904
00:55:27,858 --> 00:55:30,492
You are                         
a natural-born fighter.         

905
00:55:30,527 --> 00:55:33,128
   <i> I don't know many people</i>    
      <i> who've been through</i>      
     <i> as much as you have.</i>      

906
00:55:33,163 --> 00:55:35,864
  <i> I mean, with losing you mom</i>  
      <i> and all that drama</i>       
       <i> with your sister</i>        

907
00:55:35,899 --> 00:55:37,733
     all at the same time.      

908
00:55:37,768 --> 00:55:40,369
And even now,                   
in this crazy situation,        

909
00:55:40,404 --> 00:55:43,505
you handling it, and not        
too many people can do that.    

910
00:55:43,540 --> 00:55:45,474
        I really didn't         
        have a choice.          

911
00:55:45,509 --> 00:55:48,443
   <i> No, we all have choices,</i>    

912
00:55:48,478 --> 00:55:50,879
but it's what we choose         
to do with them that counts.    

913
00:55:50,914 --> 00:55:55,150
Look, we both made it out of    
the bottoms of New Orleans.     

914
00:55:55,185 --> 00:55:58,120
We gonna make it                
out of this, okay?              

915
00:55:58,155 --> 00:56:00,589
          - All right.          
            - Okay.             

916
00:56:00,624 --> 00:56:01,790
      ( thunder rumbles )       

917
00:56:01,825 --> 00:56:02,824
                      Thank you.

918
00:56:02,859 --> 00:56:03,992
No problem.                     

919
00:56:04,027 --> 00:56:04,927
                  I needed that.

920
00:56:08,432 --> 00:56:09,898
                            Aah!

921
00:56:09,933 --> 00:56:11,633
         Easy, cowboy.          

922
00:56:11,668 --> 00:56:13,935
Damn, Freida,                   
put that thing away.            

923
00:56:13,970 --> 00:56:16,872
  Y'all, I think I found a way  
  out of here. Where's Malik?   

924
00:56:16,907 --> 00:56:21,009
   - Where's Malik?             
   - He went looking for you.   

925
00:56:21,044 --> 00:56:24,446
   What? Stay in here,          
   lock the door, and don't move
   until I get back.            

926
00:56:24,481 --> 00:56:26,815
What is it, baby?               
What's wrong?                   

927
00:56:26,850 --> 00:56:29,718
          Just do what I say,   
          all right? Okay? Damn.

928
00:56:31,154 --> 00:56:32,755
        ( door closes )         

929
00:56:34,524 --> 00:56:36,091
                    Don't worry.

930
00:56:36,126 --> 00:56:38,627
Malik is dead, isn't he?        

931
00:56:40,630 --> 00:56:42,631
                   I don't know.

932
00:56:42,666 --> 00:56:45,601
  <i> I just don't know anymore.</i>   

933
00:56:55,045 --> 00:56:56,512
             Malik.             

934
00:56:59,883 --> 00:57:01,517
 Malik.                         

935
00:57:03,186 --> 00:57:05,487
Come on, 'lik.                  

936
00:57:14,130 --> 00:57:15,664
   Troy!                        

937
00:57:19,703 --> 00:57:22,137
   I'm gonna kill you, Troy!    

938
00:57:22,172 --> 00:57:23,772
      I'm gonna kill you!       

939
00:57:26,243 --> 00:57:29,978
     What is going on?          
     What's taking them so long?

940
00:57:30,013 --> 00:57:33,748
Relax, Monica. We tied          
that fool up pretty good.       

941
00:57:33,783 --> 00:57:36,251
Troy can't come in here         
and hurt any of us anymore.     

942
00:57:36,286 --> 00:57:39,154
      ( cell phone rings )      

943
00:57:39,189 --> 00:57:40,222
                     ( screams )

944
00:57:40,257 --> 00:57:41,923
  What?                         

945
00:57:41,958 --> 00:57:45,927
"Four down, five to go.         
Who's next?"                    

946
00:57:45,962 --> 00:57:48,096
     That's not right.          
     Only three people are dead.

947
00:57:48,131 --> 00:57:50,932
                Caprice, Johnny,
                and Dapny.      

948
00:57:50,967 --> 00:57:53,635
   - Who's the fourth person?   
   - Dwayne.                    

949
00:57:53,670 --> 00:57:55,904
      - Malik.                  
      - No, Stacy, Stacy.       

950
00:57:55,939 --> 00:57:58,073
Wait a minute. Let me go.       
I done had enough of this.      

951
00:57:58,108 --> 00:57:59,007
           Oh, shit.            

952
00:58:01,678 --> 00:58:02,911
                       Oh, baby.

953
00:58:02,946 --> 00:58:04,813
Monica, what are you            
doing out here?                 

954
00:58:04,848 --> 00:58:06,515
I thought I told you            
to stay in the room.            

955
00:58:06,550 --> 00:58:07,916
        - Are you okay?         
        - I'm fine.             

956
00:58:07,951 --> 00:58:09,651
             I thought something
             happened to you.   

957
00:58:09,686 --> 00:58:10,919
Malik's dead.                   

958
00:58:10,954 --> 00:58:12,787
                           What?

959
00:58:12,822 --> 00:58:14,789
I think he found Troy           
trying to escape.               

960
00:58:14,824 --> 00:58:16,925
         Oh, my God. What are we
         gonna do now?          

961
00:58:16,960 --> 00:58:19,060
I think I found                 
a car outside and it runs.      

962
00:58:19,095 --> 00:58:20,829
              Okay. I'll go tell
              the others.       

963
00:58:20,864 --> 00:58:22,931
Have everybody meet me          
out front, all right?           

964
00:58:22,966 --> 00:58:24,733
  - I'll bring the car around.  
  - Be careful.                 

965
00:58:24,768 --> 00:58:26,134
Hurry up. I'll be fine.         

966
00:59:33,403 --> 00:59:35,870
      So glad when this is over.

967
00:59:35,905 --> 00:59:38,774
        I do have other clients,
        you know.               

968
00:59:43,213 --> 00:59:46,648
Don't care if it ever           
rains again in my entire life.  

969
00:59:46,683 --> 00:59:48,116
      ( thunder rumbles )       

970
00:59:48,151 --> 00:59:51,886
Think they'll give Troy         
the chair?                      

971
00:59:51,921 --> 00:59:54,055
Maybe I could option his story  
for a movie of the week.        

972
00:59:54,090 --> 00:59:55,256
                   Greg, please.

973
00:59:55,291 --> 00:59:56,958
Aw, you're right.               

974
00:59:56,993 --> 01:00:00,128
Can only hope for               
an after-school special.        

975
01:00:00,163 --> 01:00:02,164
             They're leaving us.

976
01:00:08,405 --> 01:00:10,205
They're trying to leave us.     

977
01:00:14,444 --> 01:00:17,178
 Greg:<i> Monica wouldn't do that.</i> 
     <i> She's my best client.</i>     

978
01:00:17,213 --> 01:00:19,881
Well, guess what.               
Your best client just left you. 

979
01:00:24,688 --> 01:00:26,287
     I can't believe this.      

980
01:00:26,322 --> 01:00:28,089
  <i> Yeah, if they think they're</i>  
   <i> leaving us high and dry,</i>    

981
01:00:28,124 --> 01:00:30,291
<i> they got another think coming.</i> 
         <i> Now come on.</i>          

982
01:00:30,326 --> 01:00:33,028
     <i> We need to find Malik</i>     
 <i> and get the hell out of here.</i> 

983
01:00:33,063 --> 01:00:35,130
     <i> Move your ass, Greg!</i>      

984
01:00:35,165 --> 01:00:35,964
          Yes, ma'am.           

985
01:00:40,837 --> 01:00:41,937
      What are you doing?       

986
01:00:55,985 --> 01:00:58,253
             Do you even know   
             where we're headed?

987
01:00:58,288 --> 01:01:00,021
        Been walking in circles.

988
01:01:00,056 --> 01:01:02,891
Would you shut up               
so I can concentrate?           

989
01:01:07,797 --> 01:01:10,999
Oh, thank God.                  
There you are.                  

990
01:01:11,034 --> 01:01:14,102
Look, Dwayne found a way out,   
so come on. Follow me.          

991
01:01:14,137 --> 01:01:15,970
        Where's Freida?         

992
01:01:16,005 --> 01:01:19,874
              Where's Freida?   
              No, where's Malik?

993
01:01:19,909 --> 01:01:21,810
       I'm sorry, Stacy.        

994
01:01:21,845 --> 01:01:24,813
        <i> Malik is dead.</i>         

995
01:01:24,848 --> 01:01:27,182
It looks like Troy escaped      
and killed him.                 

996
01:01:27,217 --> 01:01:29,051
            <i> Sorry.</i>             

997
01:01:32,288 --> 01:01:37,726
      Okay. Look, it's all about
      my survival right now.    

998
01:01:37,761 --> 01:01:41,296
And right now what I want to    
know is where the fuck is Dwayne

999
01:01:41,331 --> 01:01:43,331
              and when the fuck 
              is he coming back?

1000
01:01:43,366 --> 01:01:45,433
      He found an old car       
        out by the shed,        

1001
01:01:45,468 --> 01:01:47,268
        and he should be        
 bringing it around any minute. 

1002
01:01:47,303 --> 01:01:49,804
- We have to meet him out there.
- That is bullshit, Monica.     

1003
01:01:49,839 --> 01:01:51,806
           I saw you get        
           in the Jeep with him,

1004
01:01:51,841 --> 01:01:54,142
      and the two of you        
      were planning to leave us.

1005
01:01:54,177 --> 01:01:55,810
      No. No, you didn't.       

1006
01:01:55,845 --> 01:01:58,413
  I was upstairs looking for you
  and Greg and Freida.          

1007
01:01:58,448 --> 01:02:01,049
 You really expect me to believe
 that load of garbage?          

1008
01:02:01,084 --> 01:02:03,451
        Look, Greg and I saw you
        sitting in that Jeep    

1009
01:02:03,486 --> 01:02:06,955
       as plain as day, so don't
       you dare try to deny it. 

1010
01:02:06,990 --> 01:02:08,757
   Greg:<i> Monica, we saw you.</i>    

1011
01:02:08,792 --> 01:02:12,927
What are you guys talking about?
       I was right here.        

1012
01:02:12,962 --> 01:02:14,929
    Cut the soap-opera bullshit,
    Miss Baby Gurl.             

1013
01:02:14,964 --> 01:02:17,532
                It is not flying
                with me, okay?  

1014
01:02:17,567 --> 01:02:19,367
Look, Stacy, listen to me.      

1015
01:02:19,402 --> 01:02:22,270
    <i> I promise you, I swear,</i>    
      <i> I was right here--</i>       

1016

         Uh, ladies...          

1017
01:02:24,207 --> 01:02:26,241

1022
01:02:33,049 --> 01:02:35,083
      - What, Greg?             
      - What is it, Greg?       

1023
01:02:35,118 --> 01:02:37,753
              I think you should
              see this.         

1024
01:02:41,491 --> 01:02:44,059
             Oh, my God, Dwayne.

1029
01:02:55,471 --> 01:02:59,007
He's dead. He's dead.           
We have to get back to the room.

1030
01:02:59,042 --> 01:03:00,408
             He's right, Monica.

1031
01:03:00,443 --> 01:03:02,310

Monica, I am so sorry.          

1034
01:03:11,187 --> 01:03:13,855
This just doesn't make          
any sense.                      

1035
01:03:13,890 --> 01:03:17,225
   If he was able to get Dwayne,
   we don't stand a chance.

01:03:20,496 --> 01:03:25,133
    Wait. Oh, my God.           
    Freida. Where's Freida?     

1037
01:03:25,168 --> 01:03:26,935
She went to look for you.

01:08:26,569 --> 01:08:28,403
              Aah!              

1105
01:08:30,273 --> 01:08:33,508
      I did. I shot Troy.       

1106
01:08:33,543 --> 01:08:36,744
      No. No, it can't be.      

1107
01:08:36,779 --> 01:08:41,783
  I don't understand. If Troy   
  isn't the killer, then who--  

1108
01:08:44,520 --> 01:08:47,188
       You're so stupid.        

1109
01:08:47,223 --> 01:08:52,293
            No. No.             

1110
01:08:52,328 --> 01:08:55,496
Guess I won't be needing        
those anymore.                  

1111
01:08:55,531 --> 01:08:59,500
  Hey, Monica, is that any way  
   to greet your big sister?    

1112

<i> this could do for Sweeps Week?</i> 

1113
01:09:03,973 --> 01:09:07,441
 - Please tell me you can act.  
 -<i> Shoot her, Greg.</i>             

1114
01:09:07,476 --> 01:09:10,244
     - She's crazy.             
     - Don't call me crazy!     

1115
01:09:10,279 --> 01:09:12,947
    Somebody could get shot.    

1116
01:09:12,982 --> 01:09:16,684
         Damn.                  
         This job is killing me.

              Monica.

              die like this.    

1120

        Don't die, Greg.        

1121

1123
01:09:34,470 --> 01:09:38,406
    Don't worry, little sis.    
I'll sign the contract for you. 

1124
01:09:38,441 --> 01:09:43,778
   Why did they let you out?    
  You're obviously still sick.  

1125
01:09:43,813 --> 01:09:45,380
       I let myself out.        

1126
01:09:48,618 --> 01:09:52,520
That place is for crazy people. 
Do I look crazy to you?         

1127
01:09:52,555 --> 01:09:54,455
         Why are you doing this?

1128
01:09:54,490 --> 01:09:56,958
                  When Mom died,
                  I took you in.

1129
01:09:56,993 --> 01:09:59,560
           I even gave you a job
           on my show,

              Aah!              

1132
01:10:10,673 --> 01:10:12,940
       And now you killed       
        all my friends.         

1133
01:10:12,975 --> 01:10:17,445
First of all, that wasn't a job.
       I was your flunky.       

1134
01:10:17,480 --> 01:10:21,315
Yeah, I tried to kill you, and I
killed all your stupid friends, 

1135
01:10:21,350 --> 01:10:24,652
  and I'm gonna kill you now,   
but that doesn't mean I'm crazy.

1136
01:10:24,687 --> 01:10:27,855
        That just means         
  I'm very fucking pissed off!  

1137
01:10:27,890 --> 01:10:30,291
    How'd you even find me?     

1138
01:10:30,326 --> 01:10:32,927
 I stopped by your fancy house  
          in the hills          

1139
01:10:32,962 --> 01:10:36,530
   and took a few souvenirs.

01:10:36,565 --> 01:10:39,033

          My car keys.          

1141
01:10:39,068 --> 01:10:43,704
Yeah. Remind me to thank        
your late, great boyfriend      

1142
01:10:43,739 --> 01:10:46,641
for leaving such detailed       
directions behind.              

1143
01:10:46,676 --> 01:10:49,543
Once I had those,               
it wasn't hard to find

    Why kill all my friends?    

1146

        to do with this.        

1147

   They're the only ones that   
   know how to tell us apart.   

1148

broke out of that insane asylum
