1
00:00:01,133 --> 00:00:04,500
(machinery clacking and whirring)

2
00:00:09,066 --> 00:00:13,233
(whooshing electronic effects over ominous ambient tones)

3
00:00:37,933 --> 00:00:42,100
(expressive, vaguely ominous piano and orchestral music)

4
00:02:20,366 --> 00:02:22,600
(birds chirping)

5
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:23,866
- Hey.

6
00:02:23,866 --> 00:02:25,533
- Finally, a chance to talk, just the girls.

7
00:02:25,533 --> 00:02:27,333
- (snickers) Where are they?

8
00:02:27,333 --> 00:02:29,366
- Where do you think, in the garage.

9
00:02:29,366 --> 00:02:32,066
(chuckles) Don never gets tired of showing off.

10
00:02:32,066 --> 00:02:35,166
This week, it's his new BMW.

11
00:02:35,166 --> 00:02:36,600
- I knew it, you know?

12
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:37,833
- What?

13
00:02:37,833 --> 00:02:39,366
- I just knew that you and Don would end up

14
00:02:39,366 --> 00:02:41,700
in some ridiculously beautiful place like this.

15
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:43,366
- Oh, it's not that great.

16
00:02:43,366 --> 00:02:44,866
- Yeah, you're breakin' my heart.

17
00:02:44,866 --> 00:02:46,600
I could really get used to this.

18
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:48,933
- Oh, so it's time for the grass is always greener thing.

19
00:02:48,933 --> 00:02:50,500
You're the one with the great marriage

20
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:52,266
and the two beautiful kids.

21
00:02:52,266 --> 00:02:55,033
- Yeah, and the mortgage, two car payments,

22
00:02:55,033 --> 00:02:58,233
and a stack of bills that never gets any smaller.

23
00:02:58,233 --> 00:03:00,400
But look at you, you're incredible!

24
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,700
- (scoffs) Oh, please!

25
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:05,033
- When's the last time you had a worry?

26
00:03:05,033 --> 00:03:06,500
- I worry.

27
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:08,066
- Oh, what about?

28
00:03:08,066 --> 00:03:10,166
What am I gonna do if the maid doesn't show up?

29
00:03:10,166 --> 00:03:11,900
- (laughs) No!

30
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:13,600
I, I have problems.

31
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:14,533
- Name one.

32
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:17,733
- Don.

33
00:03:19,566 --> 00:03:21,100
- Don?

34
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:24,166
- Yeah, I mean he's great and everything, most of the time,

35
00:03:24,166 --> 00:03:27,533
but, um, there's this little thing that,

36
00:03:27,533 --> 00:03:30,400
well, it's not so little actually.

37
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:32,500
When he was playing baseball,

38
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:34,700
women would come out of the woodwork.

39
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:37,466
I mean, it was unbelievable, at hotels, in bars,

40
00:03:37,466 --> 00:03:38,600
you wouldn't have believed it.

41
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:41,633
And then, all of the mail he got!

42
00:03:41,633 --> 00:03:44,133
Christ, it was unbelievable.

43
00:03:44,133 --> 00:03:46,866
These women would send him these sleazy Polaroids

44
00:03:46,866 --> 00:03:48,100
of themselves with, like,

45
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:50,666
their boobs hangin' out and crotch shots,

46
00:03:50,666 --> 00:03:52,566
and I would find this crap around the house,

47
00:03:52,566 --> 00:03:56,466
you know, and just throw it out, but, it was gross!

48
00:03:56,466 --> 00:03:59,166
Don's glory days, playing America's game.

49
00:03:59,166 --> 00:04:00,900
- He's retired now, what's the problem?

50
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:03,266
- The problem is he got used to it.

51
00:04:03,266 --> 00:04:05,000
Oh, hi, honey!

52
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,266
Hey, have you been in the garage this whole time?

53
00:04:07,266 --> 00:04:09,666
- Yeah, Donnie was just showing me his new toy.

54
00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:11,100
- Oh!

55
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:13,066
- Well, we should get going, huh, it's late, right?

56
00:04:13,066 --> 00:04:15,433
- Late, c'mon, it's still early!

57
00:04:15,433 --> 00:04:17,399
I know you still want a beer.

58
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:19,066
- Uh, sure, why not?

59
00:04:20,466 --> 00:04:23,066
- Well, I guess I'll call Joanie and tell her we'll be late.

60
00:04:23,066 --> 00:04:24,533
Again (scoffs).

61
00:04:24,533 --> 00:04:28,566
(woman chuckling over ominous electronic music)

62
00:04:33,033 --> 00:04:34,533
- [Don] There we go.

63
00:04:34,533 --> 00:04:35,700
- Ah, thank you.

64
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:37,033
- You know it.

65
00:04:37,033 --> 00:04:38,466
Man, I hate that shit.

66
00:04:38,466 --> 00:04:40,033
- Hate what?

67
00:04:40,033 --> 00:04:42,300
- The old lady, the way she barks at ya.

68
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:43,433
She treats you like you're a little kid or something,

69
00:04:43,433 --> 00:04:45,366
like she's your mother, I don't get it.

70
00:04:45,366 --> 00:04:47,200
- Eh, she wasn't really barking at me.

71
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:48,666
- She was barkin'.

72
00:04:48,666 --> 00:04:49,900
- Well, sometimes, you gotta listen to what they say,

73
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:52,700
you know, it just comes with the territory.

74
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:54,300
You get used to it.

75
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:59,100
- No way, pal, some things I definitely do not get used to.

76
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:02,100
Eh, fuck it, c'mon, cheers, go!

77
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:06,300
(quietly tense and ominous orchestral music and piano)

78
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:07,133
(Don gasps)

79
00:05:07,133 --> 00:05:08,566
(Tim coughing)

80
00:05:08,566 --> 00:05:11,433
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon! (Tim gagging and laughing)

81
00:05:11,433 --> 00:05:12,900
- [Tim] Hey, hey, hey, easy!

82
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:14,666
- (laughs) I can't take it!

83
00:05:14,666 --> 00:05:15,900
- A long time!

84
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:17,600
- Check the rates unless you don't got it.

85
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,400
- Oh, that feels so good!

86
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:21,633
- Hey, take a lesson! - Don't stop!

87
00:05:21,633 --> 00:05:23,900
- OK. (Wendy laughs)

88
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:25,966
- It's so hot out, let's go for a swim.

89
00:05:25,966 --> 00:05:27,100
- Sounds great, go get your suit on.

90
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:27,933
- Yeah!

91
00:05:27,933 --> 00:05:28,866
- You talkin' to me?

92
00:05:28,866 --> 00:05:29,766
- No, I don't think so (scoffs).

93
00:05:29,766 --> 00:05:30,600
- Why not?

94
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:31,866
- Well, it's late.

95
00:05:31,866 --> 00:05:32,933
- C'mon, I'll open a bottle of champagne,

96
00:05:32,933 --> 00:05:33,866
we'll all get loaded.

97
00:05:33,866 --> 00:05:35,100
- Oh, that sounds great--

98
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:36,266
- Well, we didn't bring our suits.

99
00:05:36,266 --> 00:05:37,666
- Look, we're practically family.

100
00:05:37,666 --> 00:05:38,666
I'll let you in on a little secret,

101
00:05:38,666 --> 00:05:39,900
I've seen her naked before.

102
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:41,800
- Great, thanks. (group chuckling)

103
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,033
- Well, I didn't tell you,

104
00:05:43,033 --> 00:05:44,566
but Joanie's gotta be home by five.

105
00:05:44,566 --> 00:05:46,066
She's got another gig, so I really should get going.

106
00:05:46,066 --> 00:05:47,500
- C'mon, you sure?

107
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:48,900
- Yeah, she's right, we should get goin',

108
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:50,866
but thanks for the drinks. - C'mon, c'mon!

109
00:05:50,866 --> 00:05:52,366
- [Wendy] We'll see you next time.

110
00:05:52,366 --> 00:05:53,433
- Next time, all right. - Dude, you're killin' me!

111
00:05:53,433 --> 00:05:55,966
- It's fine, let 'em go, honey.

112
00:05:55,966 --> 00:05:58,966
(Don sighs)

113
00:05:58,966 --> 00:06:02,033
(footsteps clacking)

114
00:06:04,866 --> 00:06:07,333
- (sighs) I forgot the keys.

115
00:06:07,333 --> 00:06:08,800
- Hurry up.

116
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:12,300
(distant traffic humming)

117
00:06:14,466 --> 00:06:18,633
(quietly tense and mysterious electronic music)

118
00:06:56,966 --> 00:07:01,133
(mysterious and tense electronic music with vocal choir)

119
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,266
(distant traffic whooshing)

120
00:07:22,266 --> 00:07:23,633
(car horn beeps)

121
00:07:23,633 --> 00:07:27,233
(mysterious and tense electronic music)

122
00:07:27,233 --> 00:07:30,900
(distant traffic whooshing)

123
00:07:33,566 --> 00:07:35,400
(car horn honking)

124
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:39,566
(tense and mysterious electronic music)

125
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:48,533
(distant traffic humming)

126
00:07:48,533 --> 00:07:50,966
(car horn honking)

127
00:07:50,966 --> 00:07:54,466
(distant traffic humming)

128
00:08:00,766 --> 00:08:01,966
- What's wrong with you?

129
00:08:01,966 --> 00:08:02,800
- Nothing.

130
00:08:03,966 --> 00:08:04,800
- Nothing?

131
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:07,666
Well, you got this look on your face, I mean, acting like--

132
00:08:07,666 --> 00:08:08,666
- Like what?

133
00:08:10,033 --> 00:08:11,500
- Forget it.

134
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:13,733
- Did you see how much they drank?

135
00:08:13,733 --> 00:08:15,366
- No, I didn't see how much they drank,

136
00:08:15,366 --> 00:08:17,233
but I'm sure you did.

137
00:08:17,233 --> 00:08:18,866
- She had five or six glasses of wine.

138
00:08:18,866 --> 00:08:21,966
He had 10 beers in a matter of, what, two hours?

139
00:08:21,966 --> 00:08:23,433
I think he has a problem.

140
00:08:23,433 --> 00:08:25,166
- Wendy, it's the weekend for Christ's sake.

141
00:08:25,166 --> 00:08:26,466
They're just havin' a little fun!

142
00:08:26,466 --> 00:08:30,333
- Fun, I think they were totally inappropriate.

143
00:08:30,333 --> 00:08:32,033
Can we go now?

144
00:08:32,033 --> 00:08:34,866
(engine rumbling)

145
00:08:43,633 --> 00:08:47,800
(rhythmic, mysterious electronic music with vocal choir)

146
00:09:17,433 --> 00:09:18,266
- Tired?

147
00:09:19,566 --> 00:09:20,966
- Yeah, a little.

148
00:09:22,133 --> 00:09:24,433
- You know, you are so beautiful.

149
00:09:24,433 --> 00:09:25,933
- Thanks, honey.

150
00:09:25,933 --> 00:09:27,166
It's late, huh?

151
00:09:29,166 --> 00:09:30,833
- Well, it's Friday.

152
00:09:33,033 --> 00:09:35,833
We can sleep in (scoffs).

153
00:09:35,833 --> 00:09:36,666
- Don't!

154
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:42,433
- (sighs) What's wrong with you?

155
00:09:42,433 --> 00:09:44,766
- What, what'd I do?

156
00:09:44,766 --> 00:09:46,333
- It's always something, isn't it?

157
00:09:46,333 --> 00:09:48,833
It's either too late or the kids'll hear.

158
00:09:48,833 --> 00:09:52,666
(expressive orchestral music)

159
00:10:02,066 --> 00:10:04,300
(paper crinkling)

160
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:08,133
(expressive orchestral music)

161
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:11,033
- Hey.

162
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:17,166
I'm sorry, Tim.

163
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:22,266
- It's nothing, just forget about it.

164
00:10:23,733 --> 00:10:27,866
- I know you must think I'm a bitch sometimes, Tim, but

165
00:10:27,866 --> 00:10:29,633
I worry about things.

166
00:10:30,833 --> 00:10:33,466
I mean, I worry about everything, actually.

167
00:10:33,466 --> 00:10:35,800
(Tim sighs)

168
00:10:36,966 --> 00:10:39,633
- No, I don't think you're a bitch.

169
00:10:40,633 --> 00:10:41,700
I worry, too.

170
00:10:45,133 --> 00:10:49,300
- Come back to bed before long (chuckles).

171
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:54,633
I love you.

172
00:10:56,833 --> 00:11:01,000
(lips smacking over expressive orchestral music)

173
00:11:02,866 --> 00:11:04,933
- I love you, too.

174
00:11:04,933 --> 00:11:06,700
- I'm sorry.

175
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:10,866
(expressive orchestral music and piano)

176
00:11:17,666 --> 00:11:21,833
(expressive saxophone over pleasant ambient music)

177
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:24,566
(tennis ball clacking)

178
00:12:27,466 --> 00:12:28,833
- Little out of shape there.

179
00:12:28,833 --> 00:12:30,933
Looks like you're gettin' flabby.

180
00:12:30,933 --> 00:12:32,700
- I got news for ya.

181
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:34,733
I've never been in shape.

182
00:12:34,733 --> 00:12:36,566
- It only gets harder.

183
00:12:37,433 --> 00:12:39,333
(Don grunts)

184
00:12:39,333 --> 00:12:40,566
(Tim sighs)

185
00:12:40,566 --> 00:12:43,333
Yes, that's what I'm talkin' about!

186
00:12:43,333 --> 00:12:44,866
- Phew!

187
00:12:44,866 --> 00:12:48,300
(Tim gasping over vaguely ominous electronic music)

188
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:49,466
All right, oh!

189
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:55,833
(Tim sighing heavily)

190
00:12:55,833 --> 00:12:58,566
All right, so tell me, what's the secret?

191
00:12:58,566 --> 00:13:00,800
- The secret, to what?

192
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:03,300
- A perfect life, man, the American Dream.

193
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:06,300
Seems like you've been living it.

194
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:08,533
- Yeah, I guess maybe I am.

195
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:10,733
- Well, it's obvious you've been

196
00:13:10,733 --> 00:13:13,733
the big man for a long time.

197
00:13:13,733 --> 00:13:17,566
- You know, sometimes I feel like that guy on late night TV.

198
00:13:17,566 --> 00:13:19,633
You know, a shmuck that started out with nothing.

199
00:13:19,633 --> 00:13:22,166
Now, he's got all the boats and women.

200
00:13:22,166 --> 00:13:23,900
What the hell's his name?

201
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:25,800
- I have no idea who you're talking about.

202
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:28,033
- Tommy Vu, that's it.

203
00:13:28,033 --> 00:13:30,066
Well, man, I got a couple of businesses,

204
00:13:30,066 --> 00:13:32,366
some women, a beautiful blonde wife.

205
00:13:32,366 --> 00:13:34,466
Maybe I should be on TV. (towel thwacking)

206
00:13:34,466 --> 00:13:36,433
- Why not, you got everything else.

207
00:13:36,433 --> 00:13:39,866
- Yep, come on, let's get outta here.

208
00:13:39,866 --> 00:13:43,000
(Tim sighs)

209
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:47,166
(birds cawing over muffled chatter)

210
00:13:48,633 --> 00:13:50,566
- Remember back in high school,

211
00:13:50,566 --> 00:13:53,233
when you were a jock, big man on campus.

212
00:13:53,233 --> 00:13:54,766
I remember all the girls used to pray

213
00:13:54,766 --> 00:13:57,300
that you'd come walking down the hallway and look at them.

214
00:13:57,300 --> 00:13:58,600
- You think so, huh?

215
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:00,433
- I know, I know so, I remember, Donnie.

216
00:14:00,433 --> 00:14:02,300
Then what happens after high school?

217
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:04,700
You get drafted by the Baltimore Orioles.

218
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:07,466
- What, you think that's cool, minor league baseball?

219
00:14:07,466 --> 00:14:09,866
I was fuckin' my ass over every bush league town there is,

220
00:14:09,866 --> 00:14:11,800
like Bakersfield and Fresno, for what?

221
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:13,933
Two years later, I blow out my knee.

222
00:14:13,933 --> 00:14:15,666
It ain't glamorous, Tim.

223
00:14:15,666 --> 00:14:18,666
- But that blown-out knee got you a couple of hundred grand.

224
00:14:18,666 --> 00:14:20,533
- Yes, and the end of a dream.

225
00:14:20,533 --> 00:14:22,566
What's your point, I mean, were you jealous?

226
00:14:22,566 --> 00:14:24,033
- No, I'm not jealous, I'm just saying

227
00:14:24,033 --> 00:14:25,833
that you've had it easy, that's all.

228
00:14:25,833 --> 00:14:28,033
- Right, but you have a kid.

229
00:14:28,033 --> 00:14:29,300
- Donnie, I am busting my ass

230
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:31,500
just to try to keep my head above water.

231
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:33,833
- Well, you know what your problem is?

232
00:14:33,833 --> 00:14:35,900
- No, I don't know what my problem is.

233
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:37,566
All right, tell me.

234
00:14:37,566 --> 00:14:38,500
- You really wanna know?

235
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:39,466
- Yeah, I really wanna know!

236
00:14:39,466 --> 00:14:40,733
- [Don] You play by the rules.

237
00:14:40,733 --> 00:14:43,833
- [Tim] And there's a problem with that?

238
00:14:43,833 --> 00:14:45,200
- When I traveled around the country, man,

239
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:47,933
I met a lotta guys like you, good guys.

240
00:14:47,933 --> 00:14:50,333
Good guys with big dreams,

241
00:14:50,333 --> 00:14:53,133
but you know what, they're like a buncha Boy Scouts.

242
00:14:53,133 --> 00:14:54,966
You play by the rules.

243
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:58,266
I felt sorry for those guys.

244
00:14:58,266 --> 00:15:00,100
You wanna know why?

245
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:03,166
Because at the end of the day, they had nothin'.

246
00:15:03,166 --> 00:15:05,500
- You try raisin' two kids in LA these days, Donnie.

247
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:06,933
It's tough out there, man.

248
00:15:06,933 --> 00:15:07,800
- [Don] Oh, come on, man, it's just an excuse.

249
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:09,033
It's tough everywhere!

250
00:15:09,033 --> 00:15:11,333
- [Tim] All right, so what are you drivin' at?

251
00:15:11,333 --> 00:15:12,900
- Come on.

252
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:17,066
You know, in everything, I can see the possibilities, right?

253
00:15:17,066 --> 00:15:19,400
I have the money, I have the fancy cars.

254
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:20,800
Let me tell you something, Tim.

255
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:23,366
That's power, my friend, that is absolute power,

256
00:15:23,366 --> 00:15:26,066
and it feels good, it feels real good.

257
00:15:26,066 --> 00:15:28,300
- But we all can't be so lucky, Donnie.

258
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:30,000
- Luck's got nothin' to do with it, buddy,

259
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,233
and if you think it does, you're in big trouble.

260
00:15:33,233 --> 00:15:35,966
Wanna know what success is?

261
00:15:35,966 --> 00:15:37,200
- What?

262
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:39,533
- Not havin' to worry about the bullshit.

263
00:15:39,533 --> 00:15:40,466
- Well, it sounds like a bunch

264
00:15:40,466 --> 00:15:42,500
of Tony Robbins bullshit to me.

265
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:44,266
- See, there's your problem.

266
00:15:44,266 --> 00:15:45,733
You're gonna end up like one of these bankers,

267
00:15:45,733 --> 00:15:47,000
shuffling papers all day.

268
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,933
You get home, you give your wife a kiss,

269
00:15:48,933 --> 00:15:50,533
she starts bitchin' at ya because your kid

270
00:15:50,533 --> 00:15:52,866
didn't take the dog for a walk and it shit on the floor.

271
00:15:52,866 --> 00:15:54,700
- Don't worry about me, Donnie.

272
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:57,266
- I care about ya, Tim.

273
00:15:57,266 --> 00:15:58,933
I'm not worried, I just don't wanna see you

274
00:15:58,933 --> 00:16:00,466
end up on some barstool,

275
00:16:00,466 --> 00:16:03,433
talkin' over old war stories some day, that's all.

276
00:16:03,433 --> 00:16:05,833
- Don't worry, Donnie, that's not me.

277
00:16:05,833 --> 00:16:08,000
- I hope not, I really do.

278
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:12,133
(Tim sighs)

279
00:16:14,433 --> 00:16:18,600
(engine revving over rhythmic electro rock music)

280
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:26,266
(engine rumbling over rhythmic electro rock music)

281
00:16:28,333 --> 00:16:32,166
(rhythmic electro rock music)

282
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:43,733
(muffled chatter)

283
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:48,633
(rhythmic electro rock music)

284
00:16:54,033 --> 00:16:56,100
- Oh, man, whoa!

285
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:57,600
- [Don] Nice, huh?

286
00:16:58,900 --> 00:17:01,233
- Nice ain't the word, good!

287
00:17:03,133 --> 00:17:05,900
- Hey, c'mere, check this out.

288
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:07,866
More with that came from.

289
00:17:07,866 --> 00:17:09,866
- Hey, you got padded walls?

290
00:17:09,866 --> 00:17:13,700
(rhythmic electro rock music)

291
00:17:17,033 --> 00:17:18,500
How, how do you do it?

292
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:20,333
- Gotta take a chance.

293
00:17:21,766 --> 00:17:24,099
(Tim sighs)

294
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:27,800
Come on.

295
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:30,466
(Tim sighs)

296
00:17:30,466 --> 00:17:31,300
Come on!

297
00:17:34,966 --> 00:17:36,566
- Tim, getcha anything?

298
00:17:36,566 --> 00:17:39,066
- Yes, definitely, water.

299
00:17:39,066 --> 00:17:40,500
- Come on, how 'bout a beer? (Tim sighs)

300
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:42,433
- A beer, are you kiddin' me, after that game?

301
00:17:42,433 --> 00:17:44,800
- Hey, suit yourself, suit yourself.

302
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:48,966
(ice rattling in glass)

303
00:17:48,966 --> 00:17:51,666
Did you think about what I said?

304
00:17:51,666 --> 00:17:55,200
- Yeah, Donnie, but, you know, that's a lot to digest.

305
00:17:55,200 --> 00:18:00,233
- (scoffs) You could do it, you could have all this.

306
00:18:00,233 --> 00:18:01,966
- (sighs) I don't know, man. (birds chirping)

307
00:18:01,966 --> 00:18:04,400
- See, that's your problem, Tim.

308
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:05,400
- What's the problem?

309
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:07,533
- You don't know.

310
00:18:07,533 --> 00:18:11,700
You have to have confidence, man, you have to have a vision.

311
00:18:13,233 --> 00:18:16,000
Just think about it (clears throat).

312
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,400
- Hey, you guys!

313
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:19,333
Hey, Tim, I didn't know you were comin' over.

314
00:18:19,333 --> 00:18:21,366
- Yeah, Donnie and I just played a couple of sets.

315
00:18:21,366 --> 00:18:23,000
- Oh, you did, who won?

316
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,100
- Well, I, no, he won.

317
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:28,666
- (laughs) Well, don't be such a stranger.

318
00:18:28,666 --> 00:18:31,733
(footsteps clacking)

319
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:37,333
(mysterious, vaguely ominous orchestral music and piano)

320
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:49,700
- You like?

321
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:50,533
- Huh?

322
00:18:51,666 --> 00:18:53,233
- Kim.

323
00:18:53,233 --> 00:18:57,533
- Yeah, she, she looks good, Donnie, yeah.

324
00:18:57,533 --> 00:18:59,833
- You know, um, (Tim clears his throat)

325
00:18:59,833 --> 00:19:01,333
she likes to play.

326
00:19:02,233 --> 00:19:03,700
- She what?

327
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:06,433
- (scoffs) She likes to play.

328
00:19:06,433 --> 00:19:08,166
- That's great, Donnie, you know, that's good,

329
00:19:08,166 --> 00:19:12,366
but I don't think that's any of my business.

330
00:19:12,366 --> 00:19:15,400
- Yeah, I guess you're right, it's none of your business.

331
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:19,566
(mysterious, vaguely ominous piano and orchestral music)

332
00:19:21,533 --> 00:19:25,166
C'mere for a second, I got somethin' I wanna show ya.

333
00:19:25,166 --> 00:19:29,333
(mysterious, vaguely ominous piano and orchestral music)

334
00:19:45,633 --> 00:19:47,033
Clean, huh?

335
00:19:47,033 --> 00:19:50,633
- Beautiful, fuckn' A, I'm in love (chuckles).

336
00:19:50,633 --> 00:19:52,166
- Picked it up about a month ago.

337
00:19:52,166 --> 00:19:54,333
(birds chirping)

338
00:19:54,333 --> 00:19:56,966
Practically stole it, guess who I bought it from?

339
00:19:56,966 --> 00:19:57,800
- Who?

340
00:19:57,800 --> 00:19:59,033
- Ed McMahon.

341
00:19:59,033 --> 00:20:00,033
- (scoffs) From The Tonight Show?

342
00:20:00,033 --> 00:20:01,533
- Yep, Johnny Boy.

343
00:20:03,233 --> 00:20:06,633
- [Tim] Come on, you're kiddin' me, right?

344
00:20:06,633 --> 00:20:07,466
- No.

345
00:20:08,866 --> 00:20:10,400
Why would I kid about somethin' like that, Tim?

346
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:12,100
I mean, if I was gonna lie to ya, Tim, don'tcha think

347
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:14,400
I'd come up with something better than Ed McMahon?

348
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:16,300
- I'm sorry, man, I didn't mean nothin' by it.

349
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:19,800
(distant traffic humming)

350
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:23,966
- Hey. (keys rattling)

351
00:20:23,966 --> 00:20:25,233
Take 'em.

352
00:20:25,233 --> 00:20:26,200
- What?

353
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:29,133
- Come on, take it for a ride!

354
00:20:29,133 --> 00:20:31,933
- Nah, I-I couldn't take it. (tense orchestral music)

355
00:20:31,933 --> 00:20:35,066
- Tim, I'm tellin' ya, it's yours for the weekend.

356
00:20:35,066 --> 00:20:36,366
Come on, take Wendy, I don't know,

357
00:20:36,366 --> 00:20:37,666
for a ride to the beach or--

358
00:20:37,666 --> 00:20:39,966
- I couldn't take this, I just, I--

359
00:20:39,966 --> 00:20:41,233
- Take the car!

360
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:44,466
- I don't know what to say, Donnie, it's--

361
00:20:44,466 --> 00:20:46,933
- Don't say anything, Jesus Christ!

362
00:20:46,933 --> 00:20:50,800
Will ya take the keys, have some fun for a change?

363
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:54,133
- All right, all right, all right, I'll take 'em,

364
00:20:54,133 --> 00:20:55,433
but I owe you one.

365
00:20:55,433 --> 00:20:59,133
(pleasant and expressive piano)

366
00:20:59,133 --> 00:21:00,733
- Don't hurt yourself.

367
00:21:00,733 --> 00:21:04,866
(birds chirping over dramatic, vaguely ominous piano)

368
00:21:10,633 --> 00:21:14,466
Hey, Tim, put the key in, turn it, drive away.

369
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:17,266
- Yeah, yeah, I know, I know.

370
00:21:17,266 --> 00:21:20,066
(birds chirping)

371
00:21:20,066 --> 00:21:24,233
(dramatic, vaguely ominous piano)

372
00:21:27,833 --> 00:21:29,766
(door rattling)

373
00:21:29,766 --> 00:21:33,933
(rhythmic and dramatic rock music with expressive guitar)

374
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:24,833
- [Don] So how'd it feel

375
00:22:24,833 --> 00:22:26,100
to open up that Beemer and just let it rip?

376
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:28,466
- It felt really cool, it was so great, man.

377
00:22:28,466 --> 00:22:29,733
- [Don] Yeah, I know it.

378
00:22:29,733 --> 00:22:31,266
- You know, and I felt like I was in control!

379
00:22:31,266 --> 00:22:32,500
- That's what I wanna hear.

380
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:34,100
- Yeah, thank you so much, it was so cool.

381
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:35,566
- Hey, don't mention it.

382
00:22:35,566 --> 00:22:37,966
I mean, we've been friends for, what, 20 years or something?

383
00:22:37,966 --> 00:22:41,000
- 23, actually, class of '74,

384
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,733
although if I remember correctly,

385
00:22:42,733 --> 00:22:45,300
we didn't really exactly hang out in the same circles.

386
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:46,766
- Eh, that's not what matters, I mean,

387
00:22:46,766 --> 00:22:48,533
what matters is that we've known each other for a long time,

388
00:22:48,533 --> 00:22:50,233
right, that's what makes good friends.

389
00:22:50,233 --> 00:22:51,500
- Yeah, I know, I mean,

390
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:53,000
who would've thought it after all these years,

391
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:56,366
Don White and Tim Marsh hangin' out together again?

392
00:22:56,366 --> 00:22:57,800
- You guys hidin' out here again?

393
00:22:57,800 --> 00:22:59,200
- Hey, we're just doin' boy talk.

394
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:00,800
Nothin' you ladies would be interested in.

395
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:02,000
- Oh, oh no?

396
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,066
- Well, we're interested in a lot of things.

397
00:23:04,066 --> 00:23:05,000
- You guys wouldn't have been talkin'

398
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,433
about women, now would ya?

399
00:23:06,433 --> 00:23:09,700
- Us, women, what makes you say that?

400
00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:12,033
- Because I know what men like.

401
00:23:12,033 --> 00:23:13,700
- And that would be?

402
00:23:14,733 --> 00:23:18,033
(birds chirping)

403
00:23:18,033 --> 00:23:19,600
- Hey, take a lesson!

404
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:20,600
(slap thwacking)

405
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:22,700
(Tim chuckles)

406
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:25,366
(lips smacking)

407
00:23:26,533 --> 00:23:28,800
- (chuckles) Sorry, I hope you don't mind.

408
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:31,666
It's just that sometimes, he is so irresistible.

409
00:23:31,666 --> 00:23:33,733
- [Tim] No, I don't mind.

410
00:23:35,266 --> 00:23:37,600
- So, did you bring your swimsuits?

411
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:38,800
- I brought mine.

412
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:41,000
- Oh, good, Tim, did you bring yours?

413
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,500
- (groans) I forgot.

414
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:43,900
- [Wendy And Kim] Tim!

415
00:23:43,900 --> 00:23:46,466
- I don't know what I was thinkin'.

416
00:23:46,466 --> 00:23:48,700
- Well, you don't need it anyway, let's just go in!

417
00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:51,333
- No, no, that's, that's OK, you know what?

418
00:23:51,333 --> 00:23:52,600
I'm just gonna take a little walk.

419
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:54,233
I'm feeling a little light-headed.

420
00:23:54,233 --> 00:23:55,466
- OK, whatever.

421
00:23:57,900 --> 00:23:59,033
- I'll go change.

422
00:23:59,033 --> 00:23:59,866
- OK.

423
00:24:01,366 --> 00:24:05,733
- [Don] Jesus, cleared them out pretty quick (scoffs).

424
00:24:05,733 --> 00:24:09,900
(footsteps clacking over ominous piano and orchestral music)

425
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:29,933
(Tim scoffs)

426
00:24:32,533 --> 00:24:36,700
(footsteps clacking over ominous piano and orchestral music)

427
00:24:40,933 --> 00:24:45,100
(lips smacking over chirping birds)

428
00:24:49,833 --> 00:24:52,166
(Wendy clears her throat)

429
00:24:52,166 --> 00:24:53,966
(both women chuckling)

430
00:24:53,966 --> 00:24:56,166
- Sorry, I didn't know you were, um--

431
00:24:56,166 --> 00:24:58,700
- No, don't worry, you're not the first person to see us.

432
00:24:58,700 --> 00:24:59,900
(women chuckle)

433
00:24:59,900 --> 00:25:01,233
- Yeah, half the people in Mulholland

434
00:25:01,233 --> 00:25:02,233
have seen us messin' around in this pool.

435
00:25:02,233 --> 00:25:03,600
- I didn't see anything, really.

436
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:05,466
- No, honey, don't worry about it.

437
00:25:05,466 --> 00:25:07,133
- Hey, I'm gonna go grab a bottle of Dom.

438
00:25:07,133 --> 00:25:08,100
- Good idea.

439
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:09,033
- How's the water?

440
00:25:09,033 --> 00:25:10,300
- It's good, you look great!

441
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:13,000
- Oh, please, I'd trade bodies with you anyday.

442
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:13,966
- What are you, kidding me?

443
00:25:13,966 --> 00:25:15,333
You have a fantastic figure.

444
00:25:15,333 --> 00:25:17,533
- Yeah, right, after two kids, you tell me then.

445
00:25:17,533 --> 00:25:19,366
(both women laughing)

446
00:25:19,366 --> 00:25:20,633
- Nice.

447
00:25:20,633 --> 00:25:22,866
- Yeah, water's a lil, little nippy.

448
00:25:22,866 --> 00:25:27,033
(vaguely ominous piano and guitar)

449
00:25:39,766 --> 00:25:42,333
(knocking on door)

450
00:25:42,333 --> 00:25:43,833
- What's happening?

451
00:25:43,833 --> 00:25:47,533
- Hey, uh, just takin' a little break, that's all.

452
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:52,133
(door rattling)

453
00:25:52,133 --> 00:25:55,833
Admiring the little shrine you built yourself down here.

454
00:25:55,833 --> 00:25:58,900
- Those were some good ol' days, man!

455
00:26:00,166 --> 00:26:03,566
- Yeah, seems like so long ago, though, huh.

456
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:09,333
- Yeah, it sure does. (Tim sighs)

457
00:26:09,333 --> 00:26:11,300
Hey, now, you could still have a good time tonight.

458
00:26:11,300 --> 00:26:12,166
- Yeah?

459
00:26:12,166 --> 00:26:13,933
- Yeah, picture this.

460
00:26:14,933 --> 00:26:16,233
The girls get drunk, right?

461
00:26:16,233 --> 00:26:18,933
Out of nowhere, Wendy rips off her bikini.

462
00:26:18,933 --> 00:26:19,766
- Are you shittin' me?

463
00:26:19,766 --> 00:26:20,600
- Swear to God.

464
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:22,566
- She, fucker.

465
00:26:22,566 --> 00:26:25,133
- Just jackin' your chain, bro.

466
00:26:27,866 --> 00:26:30,466
You liked cruising around in that Beemer today, didn't you?

467
00:26:30,466 --> 00:26:32,666
- Come on, who wouldn't?

468
00:26:32,666 --> 00:26:34,766
- Yeah, you know, I have a whole lot of other toys

469
00:26:34,766 --> 00:26:36,366
we could play with.

470
00:26:37,733 --> 00:26:40,000
- What d'ya have in mind?

471
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:43,600
- You know what I have in mind, the big one.

472
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:46,366
The only one that counts.

473
00:26:46,366 --> 00:26:47,766
- Which one is that?

474
00:26:47,766 --> 00:26:49,300
- You know which one that is.

475
00:26:49,300 --> 00:26:51,300
- No, I don't know which one.

476
00:26:51,300 --> 00:26:54,233
- So tell me, Tim, what toy of mine

477
00:26:56,066 --> 00:26:58,800
do you want more than anything in the world?

478
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:00,433
Be honest.

479
00:27:00,433 --> 00:27:02,133
- C'mon, I've, I've already driven your Beemer.

480
00:27:02,133 --> 00:27:05,300
What are you gonna do now, gimme the whole house (chuckles)?

481
00:27:05,300 --> 00:27:06,133
- Mm, no.

482
00:27:09,033 --> 00:27:12,866
- Now, look, you're confusing me here, just...

483
00:27:14,766 --> 00:27:16,766
- I'm talking about Kim.

484
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:23,633
- Kim?

485
00:27:25,700 --> 00:27:27,500
Come on, you're high, man!

486
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:29,166
- Well, well, maybe a little,

487
00:27:29,166 --> 00:27:30,933
but I'm serious, man.

488
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:35,233
- Look, don't go startin' that again.

489
00:27:35,233 --> 00:27:37,700
- You know, that's bullshit, man.

490
00:27:37,700 --> 00:27:39,033
I see you lookin' at her.

491
00:27:39,033 --> 00:27:40,566
- If I did, I didn't mean it.

492
00:27:40,566 --> 00:27:43,166
I didn't mean anything by it, OK?

493
00:27:43,166 --> 00:27:45,833
Look, if, if you're mad at me, I apologize.

494
00:27:45,833 --> 00:27:49,000
I mean, I was drinking and shit, and I (sighs), oh, man.

495
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,266
Did I, did I, look,

496
00:27:50,266 --> 00:27:52,666
did I make a fool out of myself up there or what?

497
00:27:52,666 --> 00:27:54,566
- Tim, uh, I'm not mad.

498
00:27:56,066 --> 00:27:57,366
She's yours.

499
00:27:57,366 --> 00:27:58,433
- She's mine?

500
00:28:00,666 --> 00:28:04,933
(scoffs) D-Donnie, this isn't makin' much sense.

501
00:28:04,933 --> 00:28:06,800
- It makes perfect sense to me.

502
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:08,000
- No, it doesn't!

503
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:11,966
- You know, that's what I was talkin' about.

504
00:28:11,966 --> 00:28:13,866
Being able to take a chance,

505
00:28:13,866 --> 00:28:15,666
break a couple of rules once in a while.

506
00:28:15,666 --> 00:28:17,266
You remember the talk we had the other day?

507
00:28:17,266 --> 00:28:18,666
- Yeah, I remember our little talk.

508
00:28:18,666 --> 00:28:20,000
What does it have to do with Kim?

509
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,066
- Everything!

510
00:28:23,033 --> 00:28:24,300
You don't get it, do you?

511
00:28:24,300 --> 00:28:25,500
- Look, look, Donnie, you're going too fast.

512
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:27,400
Just slow down a minute here, all right?

513
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:29,066
- You know, I like you, man, I like you a lot,

514
00:28:29,066 --> 00:28:31,466
but you scare the shit outta me.

515
00:28:31,466 --> 00:28:33,133
I mean, you're like a mouse!

516
00:28:33,133 --> 00:28:35,566
You live in this little hole or something, I-I don't know.

517
00:28:35,566 --> 00:28:36,966
You poke your head out, but you don't,

518
00:28:36,966 --> 00:28:38,833
but you won't come out.

519
00:28:38,833 --> 00:28:40,366
It's like you're afraid some cat's out there

520
00:28:40,366 --> 00:28:41,633
that's just gonna rip your ass off

521
00:28:41,633 --> 00:28:42,933
when you stick it out there.

522
00:28:42,933 --> 00:28:46,400
I don't get that, how can you live that way?

523
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:49,233
I mean, you're never gonna come out of your hole.

524
00:28:49,233 --> 00:28:50,600
- This is too much, Donnie.

525
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:53,633
- (scoffs) Too much, huh?

526
00:28:53,633 --> 00:28:56,066
- Yeah, I can't sleep with Kim.

527
00:28:56,066 --> 00:28:57,300
- Why not?

528
00:28:57,300 --> 00:28:59,733
- Why not, eh, you're shitting me, right?

529
00:28:59,733 --> 00:29:01,533
She's your wife, for Christ's sake!

530
00:29:01,533 --> 00:29:04,333
Doesn't that bother you?

531
00:29:04,333 --> 00:29:06,233
I mean, and not to mention the fact that I'm married.

532
00:29:06,233 --> 00:29:07,633
I got two kids, I'm just supposed to throw

533
00:29:07,633 --> 00:29:09,666
13 years of marriage out the window?

534
00:29:09,666 --> 00:29:12,233
- I'm sorry, Tim, I, I just don't see it that way.

535
00:29:12,233 --> 00:29:14,966
- No, well you should see it that way.

536
00:29:14,966 --> 00:29:16,333
I mean, people don't just go around

537
00:29:16,333 --> 00:29:19,166
offering their wives to other men.

538
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:21,866
(Don laughs)

539
00:29:21,866 --> 00:29:24,466
(chuckles) Oh, no (laughs)!

540
00:29:24,466 --> 00:29:26,466
Is this another one of your pranks?

541
00:29:26,466 --> 00:29:29,300
- (gasping) N-no.

542
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:38,133
Tim, Kim and I, you know, we, we sort of see things

543
00:29:38,133 --> 00:29:40,533
a little bit differently than other people.

544
00:29:40,533 --> 00:29:43,933
I mean, if there's something we like, feels good, we do it.

545
00:29:43,933 --> 00:29:46,666
We play by our rules, not theirs.

546
00:29:47,766 --> 00:29:49,000
I mean, it's not like we're, you know,

547
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,766
waiting for, uh, the neighbors to invite us

548
00:29:50,766 --> 00:29:53,000
to their Christmas dinners, if you know what I mean.

549
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,300
- (sighs) Donnie, she's your wife.

550
00:29:55,300 --> 00:29:58,066
- Man, you don't get it, do you?

551
00:29:58,066 --> 00:29:59,000
You remember those poor slobs

552
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,933
I told you about the other day?

553
00:30:00,933 --> 00:30:02,600
How they ended up with nothing,

554
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:04,000
well that's right where you're headed, pal.

555
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,500
- Fuck you.

556
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:08,966
- Look, Tim, don't get me wrong, I love you, man.

557
00:30:08,966 --> 00:30:10,233
It just scares the shit outta me

558
00:30:10,233 --> 00:30:14,033
to think of you becoming like one of those guys.

559
00:30:14,033 --> 00:30:16,566
You need to take a risk, Tim,

560
00:30:16,566 --> 00:30:19,200
and it's time to get off the pot.

561
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:21,866
- And just throw 13 years of marriage right out the window?

562
00:30:21,866 --> 00:30:23,333
- That doesn't have to happen.

563
00:30:23,333 --> 00:30:24,966
- Donnie, that is the first thing that happens!

564
00:30:24,966 --> 00:30:26,400
- It's not about gettin' caught,

565
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:30,000
it's about breakin' the rules, do you understand that?

566
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,500
It's about doin' something for yourself.

567
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:33,866
When was the last time you did something for yourself?

568
00:30:33,866 --> 00:30:36,633
- That is the problem with you, Donnie, OK?

569
00:30:36,633 --> 00:30:37,900
It's, it's always about you.

570
00:30:37,900 --> 00:30:39,700
You don't understand, you've never learned

571
00:30:39,700 --> 00:30:41,966
that there are consequences to your actions.

572
00:30:41,966 --> 00:30:45,300
- (scoffs) OK, you know what,

573
00:30:45,300 --> 00:30:47,200
obviously I've hit a raw nerve.

574
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:49,533
- You're damn right you did.

575
00:30:50,966 --> 00:30:54,833
I mean, look, I may not have as much as you and Kim,

576
00:30:54,833 --> 00:30:56,000
but I'm happy.

577
00:30:57,266 --> 00:31:01,166
- So (feet thudding on floor)

578
00:31:01,166 --> 00:31:02,333
still friends?

579
00:31:03,700 --> 00:31:05,766
- Yeah, oh yeah, we're still buddies.

580
00:31:05,766 --> 00:31:07,266
- Cool, head's up!

581
00:31:08,266 --> 00:31:10,100
(sighs) I guess I'll go outside

582
00:31:10,100 --> 00:31:13,033
and check on our little friends.

583
00:31:13,033 --> 00:31:16,700
(baseball thwacking on bat)

584
00:31:33,700 --> 00:31:36,966
(footsteps thunking)

585
00:31:36,966 --> 00:31:39,800
(drawer rattling)

586
00:31:43,266 --> 00:31:44,100
- What?

587
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:47,033
- [Don] Nothing.

588
00:31:47,033 --> 00:31:50,333
- You think you're real funny, don't you?

589
00:31:50,333 --> 00:31:52,433
- The hell's buggin' you?

590
00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:55,000
- You don't even know, do you?

591
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,666
That's really the sad part, Don.

592
00:31:57,666 --> 00:31:59,900
- No, all I know is I threw one damn good party tonight,

593
00:31:59,900 --> 00:32:02,333
and you're all over my ass, I mean, I, I don't get it.

594
00:32:02,333 --> 00:32:05,566
- [Kim] (laughs) One damn good party?

595
00:32:05,566 --> 00:32:07,700
You practically slobbered all over Wendy!

596
00:32:07,700 --> 00:32:09,800
- Honey, you're dreamin'.

597
00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:13,600
- You like her, don't you?

598
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:14,733
- What the hell's that supposed to mean?

599
00:32:14,733 --> 00:32:15,666
- [Kim] Admit it, you like her

600
00:32:15,666 --> 00:32:17,233
and you can't control yourself!

601
00:32:17,233 --> 00:32:19,266
- (scoffs) You know what, I'm outta here.

602
00:32:19,266 --> 00:32:20,133
- [Kim] Where are you going?

603
00:32:20,133 --> 00:32:21,333
- Watching TV.

604
00:32:21,333 --> 00:32:22,566
- [Kim] I'm not through talking to you yet.

605
00:32:22,566 --> 00:32:24,600
- Yeah, well, I've heard it all before.

606
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:26,933
- (sighs) Yeah, well, obviously it didn't sink in,

607
00:32:26,933 --> 00:32:29,433
'cause you're still thinking with your dick!

608
00:32:29,433 --> 00:32:31,966
- Yeah, and, um, you're still lovin' it.

609
00:32:31,966 --> 00:32:36,033
- (scoffs) Oh, don't fuck with me, Don.

610
00:32:36,033 --> 00:32:36,866
- Fine.

611
00:32:38,033 --> 00:32:39,533
- You're afraid of me, aren't you?

612
00:32:39,533 --> 00:32:42,100
A big tough guy like you, and you're afraid of me!

613
00:32:42,100 --> 00:32:43,666
- Yeah, that's it, I'm petrified.

614
00:32:43,666 --> 00:32:46,066
- [Kim] (laughs) I know, I can tell.

615
00:32:46,066 --> 00:32:48,866
- Why do you think I'm afraid of you, Kim?

616
00:32:48,866 --> 00:32:51,666
- Because I know what makes you tick,

617
00:32:51,666 --> 00:32:55,733
and that scares you to death, doesn't it?

618
00:32:55,733 --> 00:32:58,000
- You worry too much, baby.

619
00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:03,366
- (sighs) Don't even try to fool me, Don, it won't work.

620
00:33:04,833 --> 00:33:07,933
(footsteps thudding)

621
00:33:15,066 --> 00:33:16,600
(Tim sighs)

622
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:19,433
(muffled chatter)

623
00:33:20,866 --> 00:33:24,700
(expressive guitar and piano)

624
00:33:31,166 --> 00:33:33,633
(footsteps clacking)

625
00:33:33,633 --> 00:33:34,466
(knocking on door)

626
00:33:34,466 --> 00:33:35,466
- Mr. Marsh?

627
00:33:37,833 --> 00:33:40,933
(clears throat) Tim?

628
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:42,633
Tim?

629
00:33:44,866 --> 00:33:47,200
- Oh, I'm sorry, Sharon, I didn't see you.

630
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:48,833
- Do you need me?

631
00:33:48,833 --> 00:33:50,100
- What?

632
00:33:50,100 --> 00:33:52,000
- (scoffs) Are you gonna need me this afternoon?

633
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:55,033
I'd like to leave early, I'm not feeling well.

634
00:33:55,033 --> 00:33:57,433
- Uh, no, no, no, I don't need you.

635
00:33:57,433 --> 00:34:00,233
- So it's fine for me to leave at three?

636
00:34:00,233 --> 00:34:01,366
- Yeah, that's fine.

637
00:34:01,366 --> 00:34:03,766
- Thanks. (papers rustling)

638
00:34:03,766 --> 00:34:04,900
Have a nice weekend.

639
00:34:04,900 --> 00:34:07,200
- You, too, Sharon.

640
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:11,199
(papers rustling and thwacking)

641
00:34:12,233 --> 00:34:15,066
(muffled chatter)

642
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:19,233
(traffic humming)

643
00:34:21,566 --> 00:34:22,800
- Boo!

644
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:25,033
- Oh, Jesus Christ, you scared me, Jimmy.

645
00:34:25,033 --> 00:34:26,500
- Well, I'm sorry, Tim,

646
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:27,966
I guess I shouldn't go around scaring people like that.

647
00:34:27,966 --> 00:34:29,166
- Nah, it's not your fault, Jimmy.

648
00:34:29,166 --> 00:34:30,666
I'm just a little jumpy.

649
00:34:30,666 --> 00:34:34,766
- Well, today's Friday, you know what that means, weekend!

650
00:34:36,900 --> 00:34:37,733
Any plans?

651
00:34:39,366 --> 00:34:40,866
- Huh?

652
00:34:40,866 --> 00:34:42,466
- You plannin' on takin' the little lady anyplace special?

653
00:34:42,466 --> 00:34:45,466
- No, probably just gonna rest and relax a little bit.

654
00:34:45,466 --> 00:34:49,833
- (sighs) I'm takin' the wife to the Hollywood Bowl!

655
00:34:49,833 --> 00:34:52,233
Jeez, do I love that place.

656
00:34:52,233 --> 00:34:53,466
I mean, I'll do it up right, you know?

657
00:34:53,466 --> 00:34:56,233
I mean, uh, uh, a little wine, a little cheese,

658
00:34:56,233 --> 00:34:58,366
uh, maybe some good deli sandwiches.

659
00:34:58,366 --> 00:34:59,300
- Really?

660
00:34:59,300 --> 00:35:02,200
- Yeah, Mel Torme is playing.

661
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:05,433
(Jimmy warbles a tune)

662
00:35:07,966 --> 00:35:09,700
(Jimmy laughs)

663
00:35:09,700 --> 00:35:14,000
Oh, yeah, Betty and I just love him (sighs).

664
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,066
50 bucks for the tickets.

665
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:20,300
I mean, that's 50 bucks per ticket.

666
00:35:20,300 --> 00:35:21,700
You ever seen him?

667
00:35:21,700 --> 00:35:23,066
- No, I haven't.

668
00:35:23,066 --> 00:35:27,066
- (groans) The man is something else, The Velvet Fog.

669
00:35:27,066 --> 00:35:29,833
I mean, the guy has still got it!

670
00:35:31,566 --> 00:35:34,733
- Sounds like quite an evening, Jimmy.

671
00:35:35,933 --> 00:35:39,533
- Hey, Tim, you have a nice weekend, kay?

672
00:35:39,533 --> 00:35:41,333
- Yeah, you, too.

673
00:35:41,333 --> 00:35:44,666
(Jimmy crooning a tune)

674
00:35:46,900 --> 00:35:50,300
(toy rattling to ground)

675
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:53,866
(door rattling)

676
00:35:55,933 --> 00:35:56,866
- [Wendy] Is that you?

677
00:35:56,866 --> 00:35:57,933
- [Tim] Yeah.

678
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:01,733
(Tim sighs)

679
00:36:01,733 --> 00:36:04,366
- [Wendy] Dinner's almost ready.

680
00:36:04,366 --> 00:36:06,600
- OK, I'm gonna go wash up.

681
00:36:07,566 --> 00:36:08,500
- Want more wine?

682
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:09,766
- No, I'm fine.

683
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:14,400
- What's the matter, honey, you seem a little edgy tonight.

684
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:16,966
- Nothing's wrong, why?

685
00:36:16,966 --> 00:36:19,933
- I don't know, you seem a little preoccupied.

686
00:36:19,933 --> 00:36:21,533
- I'm just tired (groans),

687
00:36:21,533 --> 00:36:25,600
work gets me down sometimes, that's all (sighs).

688
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:28,033
It's awfully quiet in here tonight, where are the kids?

689
00:36:28,033 --> 00:36:30,400
- Oh, they had a very busy day and fell asleep

690
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:34,566
while they were watching cartoons (snickers).

691
00:36:36,366 --> 00:36:38,233
It's me, isn't it?

692
00:36:38,233 --> 00:36:40,700
I know with my new job and the kids

693
00:36:40,700 --> 00:36:42,733
and everything around the house,

694
00:36:42,733 --> 00:36:45,733
I haven't been paying any attention to you.

695
00:36:45,733 --> 00:36:48,233
- No, honey, there's nothing wrong with you.

696
00:36:48,233 --> 00:36:50,233
- I know, I mean (scoffs), I try,

697
00:36:50,233 --> 00:36:53,466
but (sighs), it just doesn't seem

698
00:36:53,466 --> 00:36:56,766
like we're having any fun anymore, honey.

699
00:36:56,766 --> 00:36:59,833
You know, sometimes we go to sleep without even talking.

700
00:36:59,833 --> 00:37:02,533
(scoffs) I worry about us.

701
00:37:02,533 --> 00:37:03,700
- Don't worry.

702
00:37:05,533 --> 00:37:07,600
- It's my fault, it's my fault

703
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:11,233
that we're not making love anymore, but I'm gonna change it.

704
00:37:11,233 --> 00:37:13,966
- Oh, it's not your fault (sighs).

705
00:37:13,966 --> 00:37:16,266
- God, you are so tight right there.

706
00:37:16,266 --> 00:37:19,233
- Mm, yeah, that feels good.

707
00:37:19,233 --> 00:37:21,200
- By the way, Don called.

708
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:22,666
- What'd he call about?

709
00:37:22,666 --> 00:37:26,800
- Um, a party tonight, something about a new car dealership.

710
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:28,233
- What time?

711
00:37:28,233 --> 00:37:29,800
- Eh, nine o'clock.

712
00:37:31,333 --> 00:37:33,833
You know, we don't have to go.

713
00:37:39,466 --> 00:37:42,300
(lips smacking over expressive piano)

714
00:37:42,300 --> 00:37:46,600
Mm, remember when we used to just stay in the house

715
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:51,233
and do this for days and never come out (giggles)?

716
00:37:51,233 --> 00:37:53,066
- (lips smacking) I miss that.

717
00:37:53,066 --> 00:37:56,833
- Me, too, we don't have to go out, you know?

718
00:37:57,666 --> 00:38:00,000
(lips smacking)

719
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,566
- No, I have to go.

720
00:38:02,733 --> 00:38:03,966
It's Donnie's big night, you know?

721
00:38:03,966 --> 00:38:06,833
He's been talking about this deal for months.

722
00:38:06,833 --> 00:38:09,066
- OK, well, make an appropriate excuse

723
00:38:09,066 --> 00:38:12,133
for me, would you (laughs)?

724
00:38:12,133 --> 00:38:15,400
- Like, uh, you're not feeling well?

725
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:17,033
- That's good (laughs).

726
00:38:17,033 --> 00:38:19,966
(lips smacking)

727
00:38:19,966 --> 00:38:21,700
- I love you.

728
00:38:21,700 --> 00:38:23,400
- I love you, too.

729
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:27,566
(lips smacking over expressive guitar and piano)

730
00:38:28,466 --> 00:38:32,300
(expressive guitar and piano)

731
00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:23,666
(lips smacking over passionate moaning)

732
00:39:27,900 --> 00:39:32,500
- [Ashley] Daddy, can I have a drink of water?

733
00:39:32,500 --> 00:39:36,133
- Your turn (giggles). - My turn.

734
00:39:36,133 --> 00:39:39,133
- (lips smacking) I'll be right there, Ashley (groans)!

735
00:39:39,133 --> 00:39:40,400
- [Ashley] When?

736
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:43,633
- In a minute (chuckles).

737
00:39:43,633 --> 00:39:44,866
(lips smacking)

738
00:39:44,866 --> 00:39:46,300
- You better get your butt up there

739
00:39:46,300 --> 00:39:48,133
or she's gonna be sleeping in our bed tonight.

740
00:39:48,133 --> 00:39:51,633
- (lips smacking) I know.

741
00:39:52,466 --> 00:39:53,433
(lips smacking)

742
00:39:53,433 --> 00:39:55,100
- I'll wait for you.

743
00:39:56,166 --> 00:39:59,633
- OK (lips smacking).

744
00:39:59,633 --> 00:40:03,066
Coming, Ashley (grunts)!

745
00:40:07,633 --> 00:40:10,366
(shower hissing)

746
00:40:21,066 --> 00:40:25,233
(vaguely ominous orchestral music and guitar)

747
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,733
(footsteps clacking)

748
00:40:47,733 --> 00:40:49,433
- I'm not sure what happened, but I'll look into it

749
00:40:49,433 --> 00:40:50,800
for you if you want me to, you liking the party?

750
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:52,133
- Oh, it's, uh--

751
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:55,066
- Hey!

752
00:40:55,066 --> 00:40:57,433
- Hey, hey, thanks for stoppin' by.

753
00:40:57,433 --> 00:40:58,633
Hey, Tim, thanks for comin'.

754
00:40:58,633 --> 00:40:59,933
- Congratulations, Don.

755
00:40:59,933 --> 00:41:01,000
- Hey, save it till after the dealership

756
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,533
lasts at least a year, all right?

757
00:41:02,533 --> 00:41:04,000
- Come on, Donnie, it's you, you're gonna do great!

758
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,733
- Eh, you're right, yeah, one sec.

759
00:41:05,733 --> 00:41:06,566
Hey, where's your drink?

760
00:41:06,566 --> 00:41:07,800
- That's my next stop.

761
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:09,266
- [Don] Go for it, talk to ya in a few.

762
00:41:09,266 --> 00:41:10,333
- You got it.

763
00:41:11,266 --> 00:41:14,100
(muffled chatter)

764
00:41:16,100 --> 00:41:16,933
Hi, Kim!

765
00:41:19,533 --> 00:41:21,200
- How are you? (footsteps clacking)

766
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:23,166
Oh, woo-woo-woo-woo (laughs)!

767
00:41:23,166 --> 00:41:24,966
Mm, good to see you, thanks for coming!

768
00:41:24,966 --> 00:41:27,000
- I wouldn't have missed this for anything,

769
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:31,200
and you look (rolls tongue), you look great!

770
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:34,033
- (laughs) Well, thanks, so where's Wendy?

771
00:41:34,033 --> 00:41:36,300
- Oh, she wasn't feeling very good, so, um,

772
00:41:36,300 --> 00:41:37,900
I'm kind of on my own tonight.

773
00:41:37,900 --> 00:41:40,200
- Oh, well, maybe next time.

774
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:42,700
Shoot, oh my gosh, new shoes.

775
00:41:42,700 --> 00:41:43,966
- [Tim] Mm-hmm.

776
00:41:43,966 --> 00:41:46,300
- Well, and I have been drinking since seven,

777
00:41:46,300 --> 00:41:48,433
so you'll have to bear with me.

778
00:41:48,433 --> 00:41:50,300
- I guess I got a little catching up to do then, huh?

779
00:41:50,300 --> 00:41:51,966
- Yeah-yeah, go catch up, and I'm gonna go,

780
00:41:51,966 --> 00:41:54,033
uh, boss around the help.

781
00:41:55,233 --> 00:41:59,333
(footsteps clacking over muffled chatter)

782
00:42:04,533 --> 00:42:07,166
- The way I see it, there are no limits, I mean none.

783
00:42:07,166 --> 00:42:09,133
We got LA, we got the Valley,

784
00:42:09,133 --> 00:42:11,233
we got Orange County, there is no reason,

785
00:42:11,233 --> 00:42:13,800
I mean no reason why we shouldn't move

786
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:16,866
at least 2000 units a month, at least.

787
00:42:16,866 --> 00:42:19,366
We're gonna own this town, you guys stick with me.

788
00:42:19,366 --> 00:42:21,433
I'll be back in a second.

789
00:42:22,566 --> 00:42:25,333
(expressive soft rock music)

790
00:42:25,333 --> 00:42:27,033
Phew (sighs)!

791
00:42:27,033 --> 00:42:30,533
Man, this is one helluva party, huh, damn!

792
00:42:31,933 --> 00:42:34,266
(Don sighs)

793
00:42:36,900 --> 00:42:38,300
You're mad at me?

794
00:42:39,166 --> 00:42:41,233
- No, I am not mad at you.

795
00:42:41,233 --> 00:42:42,333
- I can tell.

796
00:42:43,600 --> 00:42:46,933
Because of what I said the other night?

797
00:42:46,933 --> 00:42:48,400
- Look, forget it, I don't even remember

798
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:49,966
what we were talkin' about.

799
00:42:49,966 --> 00:42:52,000
- Look, man, I just brought all that stuff up about Kim,

800
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:55,300
I was just tryin' to help, that's all.

801
00:42:55,300 --> 00:42:59,200
- Look, it's water under the bridge, OK, forget it.

802
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:03,233
- Boy (sighs), I don't know, she still likes ya.

803
00:43:03,233 --> 00:43:04,666
- Look, I'm married, Donnie.

804
00:43:04,666 --> 00:43:07,666
- (scoffs) So, hey.

805
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,433
You know, I was thinking about what you said the other day

806
00:43:12,433 --> 00:43:14,600
about, uh, gettin' caught.

807
00:43:16,100 --> 00:43:17,533
I don't know, man, I just,

808
00:43:17,533 --> 00:43:19,100
I don't think it has to happen like that.

809
00:43:19,100 --> 00:43:20,566
- It always happens like that.

810
00:43:20,566 --> 00:43:21,400
- Oh, man.

811
00:43:23,133 --> 00:43:24,633
Damn, look at her.

812
00:43:27,233 --> 00:43:29,266
Damn, she's hot!

813
00:43:29,266 --> 00:43:31,933
(Don scoffs)

814
00:43:31,933 --> 00:43:34,500
I mean, you like her, don'tcha?

815
00:43:35,666 --> 00:43:37,233
- Yes, she's very pretty.

816
00:43:37,233 --> 00:43:38,833
- That's right, very beautiful,

817
00:43:38,833 --> 00:43:41,666
and you could be with her tonight.

818
00:43:42,666 --> 00:43:45,066
Nobody, man, would ever know.

819
00:43:47,566 --> 00:43:50,433
- The bullshit never stops, does it?

820
00:43:50,433 --> 00:43:52,333
- Man, you just, look,

821
00:43:52,333 --> 00:43:55,533
you just do her in the middle of the night!

822
00:43:55,533 --> 00:43:57,366
I mean, you've done that with your wife, right?

823
00:43:57,366 --> 00:44:00,733
You're loaded, she's drunk, half asleep.

824
00:44:02,166 --> 00:44:04,200
Look, you don't, doesn't matter who you're bangin',

825
00:44:04,200 --> 00:44:08,733
just as long as you're bangin', right (chuckles)?

826
00:44:08,733 --> 00:44:11,400
Could be you, that could be you.

827
00:44:12,900 --> 00:44:14,733
Shit, man, you could sleep with Kim tonight.

828
00:44:14,733 --> 00:44:18,333
She'd probably just think it was me anyway.

829
00:44:19,466 --> 00:44:22,133
You know, man, you haven't changed a bit.

830
00:44:22,133 --> 00:44:24,100
I mean, Christ, you're still afraid of gettin' caught!

831
00:44:24,100 --> 00:44:26,866
- (sighs) I am not afraid of getting caught, Donnie.

832
00:44:26,866 --> 00:44:28,500
- You are afraid of getting caught.

833
00:44:28,500 --> 00:44:31,966
You're afraid of anything that's the least bit different.

834
00:44:31,966 --> 00:44:35,133
- Look, why don't you just leave this alone.

835
00:44:35,133 --> 00:44:36,866
- You're blowin' it, man, big time!

836
00:44:36,866 --> 00:44:38,566
- Yeah, I'm blowin' it, and you know what?

837
00:44:38,566 --> 00:44:40,133
You're drunk, and this is startin' to sound

838
00:44:40,133 --> 00:44:43,200
like some bad night from the '60s.

839
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:46,700
- Whatever, just don't come moaning to me

840
00:44:46,700 --> 00:44:48,966
asking about the Great American Dream,

841
00:44:48,966 --> 00:44:52,133
because I am the Great American Dream.

842
00:44:55,333 --> 00:44:57,233
(Don sighs)

843
00:44:57,233 --> 00:45:01,500
(muffled chatter and laughing over pleasant soft rock music)

844
00:45:01,500 --> 00:45:02,333
- Ah!

845
00:45:05,933 --> 00:45:08,333
(footsteps thunking)

846
00:45:08,333 --> 00:45:13,166
(muffled chatter over pleasant soft rock music)

847
00:45:13,166 --> 00:45:14,000
- Oh!

848
00:45:17,900 --> 00:45:20,500
Thank you (laughs).

849
00:45:20,500 --> 00:45:22,433
- Tim, are you having fun yet?

850
00:45:22,433 --> 00:45:25,100
- I'm having a great time, this is a great party.

851
00:45:25,100 --> 00:45:27,100
- Oh, good, I'm so glad!

852
00:45:28,233 --> 00:45:29,633
You know, I'm really glad you and Don

853
00:45:29,633 --> 00:45:31,133
kept up after all these years.

854
00:45:31,133 --> 00:45:34,333
I think you'll be good for him.

855
00:45:34,333 --> 00:45:36,400
- I don't think Donnie needs much help.

856
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:38,833
- Oh, yes he does (chuckles).

857
00:45:38,833 --> 00:45:41,033
Besides, you're different.

858
00:45:41,033 --> 00:45:42,266
- What do you mean?

859
00:45:42,266 --> 00:45:43,933
- Oh, I mean from Don and all of his friends,

860
00:45:43,933 --> 00:45:48,466
you're, you're quiet and you don't brag all the time.

861
00:45:48,466 --> 00:45:50,200
(laughs) I like that in a man.

862
00:45:50,200 --> 00:45:51,733
(both chuckling)

863
00:45:51,733 --> 00:45:54,000
- Well, Donnie's got a lot to brag about.

864
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:57,633
- Well, he thinks he does anyway (chuckles).

865
00:45:57,633 --> 00:45:59,300
But why are we talkin' about Don?

866
00:45:59,300 --> 00:46:00,600
- I don't know!

867
00:46:00,600 --> 00:46:02,500
- You must get sick of it, Don this, Don that.

868
00:46:02,500 --> 00:46:04,000
Everyone's always talkin' about him,

869
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,666
and here I am making a fool out of myself talking about--

870
00:46:06,666 --> 00:46:09,333
- [Both] Don (laughing).

871
00:46:09,333 --> 00:46:11,833
- So, um, ya'll have two kids.

872
00:46:11,833 --> 00:46:15,300
- Yeah, yeah, Ashley is six and,

873
00:46:15,300 --> 00:46:16,666
and Ricky's four.

874
00:46:16,666 --> 00:46:19,700
- Ricky's four, wow, (gasps) how sweet!

875
00:46:19,700 --> 00:46:20,933
- Yeah, he's four all right.

876
00:46:20,933 --> 00:46:22,400
Oh (laughs)! (Tim chuckles)

877
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:24,733
Well, Don and I don't have any kids, obviously,

878
00:46:24,733 --> 00:46:28,133
but I'm thinkin', I'm thinkin' we might.

879
00:46:28,133 --> 00:46:30,566
I don't know, we haven't been married that long.

880
00:46:30,566 --> 00:46:32,533
How long have we been married?

881
00:46:32,533 --> 00:46:34,500
Oh, it's just been over a year.

882
00:46:34,500 --> 00:46:36,800
- Let me tell you, kids change everything (chuckles).

883
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:38,900
- That's what I've heard.

884
00:46:40,300 --> 00:46:42,633
(Kim sighs)

885
00:46:43,533 --> 00:46:45,966
- (snickers) What?

886
00:46:45,966 --> 00:46:48,033
- Ah, I was just thinking.

887
00:46:48,033 --> 00:46:48,866
- About?

888
00:46:49,733 --> 00:46:50,900
- About you.

889
00:46:50,900 --> 00:46:51,800
- About me?

890
00:46:53,500 --> 00:46:55,733
- Yeah, I was just thinking

891
00:46:57,233 --> 00:47:01,400
what it would've been like if I met you before I met Don.

892
00:47:02,600 --> 00:47:04,766
(Tim scoffs)

893
00:47:04,766 --> 00:47:08,033
- Mrs. White, you have a phone call.

894
00:47:08,033 --> 00:47:09,733
- Oh, OK, I'll be right there.

895
00:47:09,733 --> 00:47:12,866
(pleasant soft rock music with expressive saxophone)

896
00:47:12,866 --> 00:47:14,400
I'll see you later.

897
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:18,566
(muffled chatter over pleasant soft rock music)

898
00:47:25,833 --> 00:47:28,933
(footsteps clacking)

899
00:47:31,733 --> 00:47:33,900
Now, uh, now my husband's having this party, though,

900
00:47:33,900 --> 00:47:36,666
and it's, like, drivin' me crazy.

901
00:47:38,666 --> 00:47:42,833
(laughs) I know, I know, you should see some of his friends.

902
00:47:45,166 --> 00:47:48,633
Oh, there's this one guy, though, who's really cute.

903
00:47:48,633 --> 00:47:51,633
(footsteps clacking)

904
00:47:51,633 --> 00:47:52,833
(ice rattling in glass)

905
00:47:52,833 --> 00:47:54,366
I'll call you back.

906
00:47:54,366 --> 00:47:57,133
(phone rattling)

907
00:47:58,066 --> 00:47:59,333
(door rattling)

908
00:47:59,333 --> 00:48:02,466
Tim, come in, come on over and have a seat.

909
00:48:03,866 --> 00:48:05,100
- How are ya?

910
00:48:05,100 --> 00:48:07,400
- I'm good, I'm glad you came in here.

911
00:48:07,400 --> 00:48:11,566
You know, um, I'm a little drunk (snickers),

912
00:48:12,700 --> 00:48:15,666
but, uh, I think you're really cute.

913
00:48:16,900 --> 00:48:20,800
- Uh, thank you. (Kim laughing)

914
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,833
- You seem like a really sweet guy.

915
00:48:28,900 --> 00:48:31,566
(lips smacking)

916
00:48:36,266 --> 00:48:38,400
(door creaking)

917
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:39,233
(slap cracking)

918
00:48:39,233 --> 00:48:40,300
(Tim groans)

919
00:48:40,300 --> 00:48:41,966
- I'm sorry.

920
00:48:41,966 --> 00:48:43,033
- Really, I, I just, I--

921
00:48:43,033 --> 00:48:44,133
- Just don't.

922
00:48:45,033 --> 00:48:48,766
(ice rattling in glass)

923
00:48:48,766 --> 00:48:50,266
- So what you guys have to realize

924
00:48:50,266 --> 00:48:52,800
is it doesn't just happen, you've gotta make it happen.

925
00:48:52,800 --> 00:48:55,733
You gotta get out there and, hey, buddy, how's it goin'?

926
00:48:55,733 --> 00:48:58,166
- Good, Donnie, good, hey, good party, man.

927
00:48:58,166 --> 00:48:59,633
- Ah, thanks, thanks, look,

928
00:48:59,633 --> 00:49:01,100
we're goin' down to the Century Club for a nightcap.

929
00:49:01,100 --> 00:49:02,866
Come with us.

930
00:49:02,866 --> 00:49:04,766
- Nah, nah, I'm a little tired,

931
00:49:04,766 --> 00:49:07,133
and had a couple of drinks, I gotta drive, so.

932
00:49:07,133 --> 00:49:08,966
- Come on, just one!

933
00:49:08,966 --> 00:49:11,000
- Nah, I think I'm just gonna call it a night, Donnie.

934
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:13,833
All right, thanks, good party, you guys take care.

935
00:49:13,833 --> 00:49:14,766
- Just one!

936
00:49:16,366 --> 00:49:18,166
Well, so anyway.

937
00:49:18,166 --> 00:49:22,333
(crickets chirping over ominous orchestral music)

938
00:49:43,866 --> 00:49:48,033
(engine rumbling over ominous orchestral music)

939
00:50:03,533 --> 00:50:07,700
(ominous, vaguely eerie orchestral music)

940
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:14,666
(phone ringing)

941
00:50:16,533 --> 00:50:17,666
- Hello?

942
00:50:17,666 --> 00:50:19,966
- [Kim] Are you coming over?

943
00:50:19,966 --> 00:50:21,233
- What do you mean?

944
00:50:21,233 --> 00:50:24,066
- [Kim] To finish what you started.

945
00:50:24,066 --> 00:50:28,666
(ominous, vaguely eerie orchestral music)

946
00:50:28,666 --> 00:50:31,766
- I think you have the wrong number.

947
00:50:31,766 --> 00:50:33,233
(phone rattling)

948
00:50:33,233 --> 00:50:37,400
(ominous, vaguely eerie orchestral music)

949
00:50:54,900 --> 00:50:57,000
(faucet hissing)

950
00:50:57,000 --> 00:51:01,166
(ominous and eerie orchestral music)

951
00:51:05,966 --> 00:51:09,133
(tense cymbal accent)

952
00:51:10,866 --> 00:51:13,266
(door creaking)

953
00:51:13,266 --> 00:51:17,433
(eerie orchestral music with tense percussion accents)

954
00:51:30,166 --> 00:51:34,333
(eerie and tense orchestral music and piano)

955
00:51:58,133 --> 00:52:00,833
(door rattling)

956
00:52:07,833 --> 00:52:12,000
(eerie and tense orchestral music)

957
00:52:56,533 --> 00:53:00,733
(rhythmic and expressive orchestral music)

958
00:53:10,166 --> 00:53:14,333
(expressive guitar and orchestral music)

959
00:53:23,166 --> 00:53:26,000
(blower whirring)

960
00:53:31,833 --> 00:53:36,000
(birds chirping over rumbling engine)

961
00:53:39,433 --> 00:53:43,266
(muffled birds chirping)

962
00:53:43,266 --> 00:53:45,433
(phone ringing)

963
00:53:45,433 --> 00:53:47,300
- Mm, let it ring, it's early.

964
00:53:47,300 --> 00:53:49,933
(phone ringing)

965
00:53:49,933 --> 00:53:53,733
- (sighs) I can't sleep, I'll get it.

966
00:53:53,733 --> 00:53:54,733
Hello, yeah.

967
00:53:56,966 --> 00:54:00,200
No, no problem, no, I wasn't sleeping.

968
00:54:01,766 --> 00:54:05,933
What, you're kidding! (sheets rustling)

969
00:54:07,366 --> 00:54:11,200
Oh, Jesus Christ, yeah, yeah, I'll be right over.

970
00:54:11,200 --> 00:54:12,400
- Who was it? (tense orchestral music)

971
00:54:12,400 --> 00:54:13,566
What's the matter, what happened?

972
00:54:13,566 --> 00:54:15,866
- It was Donnie, there's been an accident.

973
00:54:15,866 --> 00:54:16,800
- Is he OK?

974
00:54:17,866 --> 00:54:18,800
- It's Kim.

975
00:54:18,800 --> 00:54:19,800
- Is she all right?

976
00:54:19,800 --> 00:54:20,733
- [Tim] I don't know.

977
00:54:20,733 --> 00:54:22,066
- Well, what did Don say?

978
00:54:22,066 --> 00:54:24,933
- He said something bad happened to Kim.

979
00:54:24,933 --> 00:54:26,700
(sighs) I'm gonna go over there.

980
00:54:26,700 --> 00:54:30,866
(ominous and tense orchestral music)

981
00:54:35,500 --> 00:54:39,666
(camera shutter snapping over ominous orchestral music)

982
00:54:42,766 --> 00:54:46,933
(ominous orchestral music with eerie strings)

983
00:55:02,466 --> 00:55:04,233
- [Jack] Whatta you got?

984
00:55:04,233 --> 00:55:05,700
- Looks like her old man found her,

985
00:55:05,700 --> 00:55:07,600
uh, at around six o'clock in the morning.

986
00:55:07,600 --> 00:55:11,833
The actual 911 call came in at, uh, 6:17.

987
00:55:11,833 --> 00:55:13,300
Someone must've slashed her throat

988
00:55:13,300 --> 00:55:16,833
and beat the hell out of her with some sort of club.

989
00:55:16,833 --> 00:55:17,833
What a mess.

990
00:55:18,866 --> 00:55:20,333
- Who is she?

991
00:55:20,333 --> 00:55:23,533
- Uh, she is a Kimberly White, 27 years old.

992
00:55:23,533 --> 00:55:25,766
Uh, we haven't checked everything out,

993
00:55:25,766 --> 00:55:28,600
but it doesn't look like we're seeing any forced entry here,

994
00:55:28,600 --> 00:55:30,200
and the security company has no report

995
00:55:30,200 --> 00:55:32,300
of the alarm being triggered.

996
00:55:32,300 --> 00:55:34,133
- Well, where's he?

997
00:55:34,133 --> 00:55:36,700
- He's in the kitchen right now talkin' to Wilshire.

998
00:55:36,700 --> 00:55:38,533
He's pretty shaken up.

999
00:55:39,666 --> 00:55:40,666
- Kay, I'm gonna take a look around,

1000
00:55:40,666 --> 00:55:41,900
then go talk to him.

1001
00:55:41,900 --> 00:55:44,300
- OK, Lutack, let's go check out the perimeter.

1002
00:55:44,300 --> 00:55:47,300
(dramatic orchestral music)

1003
00:55:47,300 --> 00:55:48,433
- So you found your wife?

1004
00:55:48,433 --> 00:55:51,900
- (sighs) Yeah.

1005
00:55:51,900 --> 00:55:53,566
- About what time was that?

1006
00:55:53,566 --> 00:55:58,166
- (sighs) Six, 6:15, I, I don't know.

1007
00:55:58,166 --> 00:55:59,833
- [Jack] Is that your usual time getting home?

1008
00:55:59,833 --> 00:56:01,100
- No.

1009
00:56:01,100 --> 00:56:02,966
No, actually I took some sales reps

1010
00:56:02,966 --> 00:56:05,033
out for a celebration last night.

1011
00:56:05,033 --> 00:56:06,400
- Sales reps?

1012
00:56:06,400 --> 00:56:08,733
- Yeah, I own a car dealership.

1013
00:56:08,733 --> 00:56:10,466
We, uh, had a little party here,

1014
00:56:10,466 --> 00:56:13,166
and then afterwards, went out for a few drinks.

1015
00:56:13,166 --> 00:56:15,166
- Well, I'll have to get their names before I leave today.

1016
00:56:15,166 --> 00:56:17,800
You can leave them with the sergeant.

1017
00:56:17,800 --> 00:56:21,100
Your wife, uh, she stayed at home?

1018
00:56:21,100 --> 00:56:21,933
- Yeah.

1019
00:56:23,100 --> 00:56:24,700
She said she was tired, and just wanted to go

1020
00:56:24,700 --> 00:56:26,533
up into the bed, go to bed.

1021
00:56:26,533 --> 00:56:29,700
- And you found her when you got home?

1022
00:56:30,733 --> 00:56:32,100
- Yeah.

1023
00:56:32,100 --> 00:56:33,100
- I'm sorry.

1024
00:56:34,966 --> 00:56:39,133
Did you touch anything in the room, anything around the bed?

1025
00:56:41,300 --> 00:56:43,800
- Probably, I, I saw her laying there on the bed,

1026
00:56:43,800 --> 00:56:45,733
and I raced over to the phone, I called 911.

1027
00:56:45,733 --> 00:56:48,466
I'm sure I did touch something.

1028
00:56:48,466 --> 00:56:50,000
- Is there an alarm in the house?

1029
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:51,366
- Yeah.

1030
00:56:51,366 --> 00:56:53,666
- Well, our guys report no sign of forced entry

1031
00:56:53,666 --> 00:56:57,766
and Westec doesn't have any calls for a break-in.

1032
00:56:59,466 --> 00:57:01,700
- Maybe she just forgot to put it on.

1033
00:57:01,700 --> 00:57:02,966
- What time was it you said

1034
00:57:02,966 --> 00:57:04,700
you took your sales reps out last night?

1035
00:57:04,700 --> 00:57:06,666
- I don't know, it had to be around one o'clock.

1036
00:57:06,666 --> 00:57:10,633
The party was ending here, we went out for a nightcap, damn!

1037
00:57:10,633 --> 00:57:12,633
- And nothing's missing?

1038
00:57:14,200 --> 00:57:17,433
- I don't know, I (sighs), I don't think so.

1039
00:57:17,433 --> 00:57:19,833
- How long were you married?

1040
00:57:19,833 --> 00:57:22,100
- About two years.

1041
00:57:22,100 --> 00:57:24,700
- Did your wife have any enemies that you know about?

1042
00:57:24,700 --> 00:57:26,200
Old jealous boyfriend--

1043
00:57:26,200 --> 00:57:28,533
- No, no, nothin' like that.

1044
00:57:29,666 --> 00:57:30,900
- Well, I really appreciate you

1045
00:57:30,900 --> 00:57:33,566
taking the time out to talk to me.

1046
00:57:34,666 --> 00:57:36,866
Call me, whatever time of night,

1047
00:57:36,866 --> 00:57:39,166
if you wanna talk about anything, call.

1048
00:57:39,166 --> 00:57:40,266
- [Don] Sure.

1049
00:57:42,500 --> 00:57:44,000
(Don sighs)

1050
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:47,700
(traffic humming over tense and dramatic orchestral music)

1051
00:57:51,600 --> 00:57:55,166
(engine rumbles to a stop)

1052
00:58:02,033 --> 00:58:03,900
- [Tim] Donnie, what's goin' on, where's Kim?

1053
00:58:03,900 --> 00:58:05,500
What happened?

1054
00:58:05,500 --> 00:58:07,166
- It's bad, man.

1055
00:58:07,166 --> 00:58:09,000
I got home last night about 5:30,

1056
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:13,733
(sniveling) there was blood everywhere.

1057
00:58:13,733 --> 00:58:15,366
Somebody beat the shit outta Kim.

1058
00:58:15,366 --> 00:58:19,633
(ominous and tense orchestral music)

1059
00:58:19,633 --> 00:58:22,766
I, I didn't know what to do (panting).

1060
00:58:22,766 --> 00:58:24,166
Christ, why did I go out last night, man,

1061
00:58:24,166 --> 00:58:26,200
I should've just fuckin' stayed here!

1062
00:58:26,200 --> 00:58:28,766
(panting) God!

1063
00:58:30,066 --> 00:58:31,833
- Donnie, I was here.

1064
00:58:33,066 --> 00:58:34,800
I was with Kim last night.

1065
00:58:34,800 --> 00:58:37,733
(Don panting)

1066
00:58:37,733 --> 00:58:38,566
- What?

1067
00:58:38,566 --> 00:58:40,766
- I am so sorry, Donnie.

1068
00:58:40,766 --> 00:58:42,333
- What are saying?

1069
00:58:42,333 --> 00:58:43,566
Son of a bitch, you killed her!

1070
00:58:43,566 --> 00:58:44,800
- [Tim] No, no, I didn't hurt her!

1071
00:58:44,800 --> 00:58:46,833
- Don't you lie to me, you killed my angel!

1072
00:58:46,833 --> 00:58:50,166
- Donnie, I made love to her, I didn't kill her.

1073
00:58:50,166 --> 00:58:52,166
I would never hurt Kim.

1074
00:58:52,166 --> 00:58:53,700
You were the one who kept talkin' about it!

1075
00:58:53,700 --> 00:58:57,800
You told me to do it, I mean, you told me to sleep with her!

1076
00:58:57,800 --> 00:59:01,100
- What (gasping)?

1077
00:59:01,100 --> 00:59:02,533
You were here last night!

1078
00:59:02,533 --> 00:59:06,700
(both panting over dramatic orchestral music)

1079
00:59:07,966 --> 00:59:12,200
Whoa, no, they're gonna think you did it!

1080
00:59:12,200 --> 00:59:14,433
What, Christ, man, what are we gonna tell the cops?

1081
00:59:14,433 --> 00:59:16,633
What are you gonna tell 'em, they're never gonna believe us!

1082
00:59:16,633 --> 00:59:18,966
- Donnie, you gotta, you gotta tell 'em the truth!

1083
00:59:18,966 --> 00:59:19,966
- The truth?

1084
00:59:21,600 --> 00:59:24,433
Ah, oh (gasping)!

1085
00:59:25,466 --> 00:59:27,466
- Look, Donnie,

1086
00:59:27,466 --> 00:59:31,000
what I did last night was stupid.

1087
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:34,200
I would never hurt Kim. (Don gasping)

1088
00:59:34,200 --> 00:59:36,200
I would never hurt Kim!

1089
00:59:36,200 --> 00:59:40,366
(both gasping over dramatic orchestral music)

1090
00:59:46,666 --> 00:59:48,633
- Hey, did you talk to the husband yet?

1091
00:59:48,633 --> 00:59:49,466
- Yeah.

1092
00:59:50,866 --> 00:59:53,600
He was, uh, gone from one in the morning until he found her.

1093
00:59:53,600 --> 00:59:54,433
- Read it.

1094
00:59:55,600 --> 00:59:59,200
The lab recovered semen from vaginal tissues.

1095
00:59:59,200 --> 01:00:00,600
- So?

1096
01:00:00,600 --> 01:00:02,466
- So the husband says he leaves at one with his buddies.

1097
01:00:02,466 --> 01:00:05,266
He comes home at six, he finds her dead.

1098
01:00:05,266 --> 01:00:06,933
When does he do her?

1099
01:00:08,666 --> 01:00:11,533
- Are you kidding me (scoffs)?

1100
01:00:11,533 --> 01:00:15,766
(scoffs) It was a party, he takes her upstairs

1101
01:00:15,766 --> 01:00:18,666
to the bedroom, slips her dress off,

1102
01:00:18,666 --> 01:00:20,100
mumbles something dirty in her ear,

1103
01:00:20,100 --> 01:00:23,100
and they do the nasty while the party's going on.

1104
01:00:23,100 --> 01:00:24,800
It happens all the time.

1105
01:00:24,800 --> 01:00:26,366
- I don't think so.

1106
01:00:26,366 --> 01:00:28,200
- Oh, so you're an expert on marriage now?

1107
01:00:28,200 --> 01:00:30,633
- Listen, wise guy, the lab said that the semen

1108
01:00:30,633 --> 01:00:32,733
had been there less than three hours,

1109
01:00:32,733 --> 01:00:35,066
meaning it couldn't be the husband's.

1110
01:00:35,066 --> 01:00:36,166
- Well, that's just an estimate.

1111
01:00:36,166 --> 01:00:37,700
There's no way to pinpoint that.

1112
01:00:37,700 --> 01:00:39,566
- You know what I'm thinkin'?

1113
01:00:39,566 --> 01:00:43,100
(scoffs) I'm thinkin' there was someone else.

1114
01:00:43,100 --> 01:00:45,533
Someone between the time he left

1115
01:00:45,533 --> 01:00:47,733
and the time he finds her dead.

1116
01:00:47,733 --> 01:00:49,566
- Test out the theory.

1117
01:00:51,333 --> 01:00:52,866
- Meaning what?

1118
01:00:52,866 --> 01:00:56,266
- Meaning check it out, bring Mr. White downtown,

1119
01:00:56,266 --> 01:00:58,533
make he pee in a Dixie cup.

1120
01:00:59,966 --> 01:01:03,466
And then, if the semen doesn't match, you've got a lead.

1121
01:01:03,466 --> 01:01:06,533
Otherwise, you're just blowin' smoke.

1122
01:01:08,633 --> 01:01:11,600
- There's not enough probable cause for that.

1123
01:01:11,600 --> 01:01:12,833
- Hey, ask him.

1124
01:01:12,833 --> 01:01:16,000
If he's got nothin' to hide, he'll consent.

1125
01:01:17,766 --> 01:01:19,766
- OK, I'll see ya later.

1126
01:01:29,533 --> 01:01:30,600
- So you didn't tell 'em?

1127
01:01:30,600 --> 01:01:31,500
- I couldn't!

1128
01:01:31,500 --> 01:01:32,900
- Why not?

1129
01:01:32,900 --> 01:01:34,566
- And say what?

1130
01:01:34,566 --> 01:01:36,033
By the way, Lieutenant, when I left the party,

1131
01:01:36,033 --> 01:01:37,900
my best friend slept with my wife,

1132
01:01:37,900 --> 01:01:40,700
and then I came home and found her dead?

1133
01:01:40,700 --> 01:01:42,800
- You said you were gonna tell 'em the truth, Donnie.

1134
01:01:42,800 --> 01:01:43,966
- [Don] I did.

1135
01:01:46,400 --> 01:01:47,233
- Don,

1136
01:01:48,133 --> 01:01:48,966
hi.

1137
01:01:48,966 --> 01:01:49,800
- [Don] Hi.

1138
01:01:49,800 --> 01:01:50,700
- How ya doin', honey?

1139
01:01:50,700 --> 01:01:52,900
- I'm all right, thanks.

1140
01:01:52,900 --> 01:01:55,066
- Call me if you need anything, OK?

1141
01:01:55,066 --> 01:01:55,900
- Yeah.

1142
01:01:57,233 --> 01:02:00,366
(footsteps clacking)

1143
01:02:01,666 --> 01:02:04,200
So how much does she know?

1144
01:02:04,200 --> 01:02:05,033
- Nothing.

1145
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:07,066
I'm not gonna blow my marriage

1146
01:02:07,066 --> 01:02:09,033
over a one night stand, Donnie.

1147
01:02:09,033 --> 01:02:12,300
- She's gonna find out sooner or later.

1148
01:02:12,300 --> 01:02:16,300
(sighs) Oh, man, I gotta get outta here.

1149
01:02:16,300 --> 01:02:18,866
- I mean, Donnie, what do I do?

1150
01:02:20,033 --> 01:02:22,400
- Look, you can't go to the cops.

1151
01:02:22,400 --> 01:02:24,633
If you tell 'em that you and Kim were together that night,

1152
01:02:24,633 --> 01:02:26,400
they're never gonna believe it, man.

1153
01:02:26,400 --> 01:02:28,433
They're gonna think you did it.

1154
01:02:28,433 --> 01:02:30,166
You gotta keep your mouth shut

1155
01:02:30,166 --> 01:02:33,900
and pray like hell they catch the guy.

1156
01:02:33,900 --> 01:02:36,000
- (sighs) And that's it?

1157
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:39,533
- That's it. (Tim sighs)

1158
01:02:39,533 --> 01:02:42,800
Hey, come on, just stay tough, all right?

1159
01:02:42,800 --> 01:02:44,366
Just, right? - Yeah.

1160
01:02:50,266 --> 01:02:53,266
(Tim sighs heavily)

1161
01:02:54,466 --> 01:02:58,300
(footsteps thudding over muffled chatter)

1162
01:02:58,300 --> 01:02:59,133
- [Officer] Lieutenant Matthews?

1163
01:02:59,133 --> 01:03:00,166
- Yeah.

1164
01:03:00,166 --> 01:03:00,833
- [Officer] We got your results.

1165
01:03:00,833 --> 01:03:02,200
- Thanks.

1166
01:03:02,200 --> 01:03:06,366
(footsteps thudding over muffled chatter)

1167
01:03:07,500 --> 01:03:10,466
(paper crinkling)

1168
01:03:10,466 --> 01:03:12,400
- So, it doesn't match?

1169
01:03:14,033 --> 01:03:16,133
- Nope, you were right.

1170
01:03:16,133 --> 01:03:19,700
- (snickers) Incredible.

1171
01:03:19,700 --> 01:03:23,366
- Shit just keeps getting deeper and deeper.

1172
01:03:24,833 --> 01:03:27,900
We know that the that night Kim White died, she had sex.

1173
01:03:27,900 --> 01:03:30,433
The lab found three ccs of semen.

1174
01:03:30,433 --> 01:03:34,366
Only problem, it wasn't her husband's.

1175
01:03:34,366 --> 01:03:36,566
- So he had a secret lover.

1176
01:03:36,566 --> 01:03:38,866
I mean, that's what I've been saying all along!

1177
01:03:38,866 --> 01:03:41,433
- So the second guy's the one that cut her?

1178
01:03:41,433 --> 01:03:44,600
- Well, look, Don White volunteered to give the sample.

1179
01:03:44,600 --> 01:03:46,866
He was totally cooperative.

1180
01:03:49,166 --> 01:03:51,800
I'm beginning to think he's in the clear.

1181
01:03:51,800 --> 01:03:53,400
- Oh, you think so?

1182
01:03:54,600 --> 01:03:55,933
- Well, why not?

1183
01:03:57,233 --> 01:03:59,466
I mean, he didn't object to the semen testing,

1184
01:03:59,466 --> 01:04:02,600
and he certainly didn't act suspicious.

1185
01:04:02,600 --> 01:04:06,966
You find the guy who did her, you find the guy who cut her.

1186
01:04:06,966 --> 01:04:08,366
- No, I'm thinkin' just the opposite.

1187
01:04:08,366 --> 01:04:09,800
You find the guy that didn't do her,

1188
01:04:09,800 --> 01:04:11,733
and you found the guy that cut her.

1189
01:04:11,733 --> 01:04:13,633
- You mean her husband?

1190
01:04:14,633 --> 01:04:16,600
- Well think about it,

1191
01:04:16,600 --> 01:04:21,000
she's got a boyfriend, someone she sees regular.

1192
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:23,700
The husband goes out with his pals,

1193
01:04:23,700 --> 01:04:26,600
she calls the boyfriend over for a quickie.

1194
01:04:26,600 --> 01:04:28,733
He comes over, they fool around,

1195
01:04:28,733 --> 01:04:32,633
and as the boyfriend's leaving, the husband sees him.

1196
01:04:32,633 --> 01:04:34,300
He flies into a rage.

1197
01:04:34,300 --> 01:04:35,966
- So why not just pull another OJ and,

1198
01:04:35,966 --> 01:04:39,066
and, uh, kill the boyfriend or kill them both.

1199
01:04:39,066 --> 01:04:42,600
- Nah, this is a rage killing, he was mad at her.

1200
01:04:42,600 --> 01:04:44,966
- So there's someone out there who knows a whole lot

1201
01:04:44,966 --> 01:04:47,466
about what happened prior to the murder.

1202
01:04:47,466 --> 01:04:50,266
- Yep, and he's probably afraid to come forward.

1203
01:04:50,266 --> 01:04:52,700
(Liz sighs)

1204
01:04:52,700 --> 01:04:55,400
What was the time of death?

1205
01:04:55,400 --> 01:04:57,800
- Between five and six.

1206
01:04:57,800 --> 01:05:00,266
- And what time did the husband leave the club?

1207
01:05:00,266 --> 01:05:03,333
- (sighs) Somewhere around five,

1208
01:05:03,333 --> 01:05:06,066
but they were in Century City.

1209
01:05:06,066 --> 01:05:09,900
That's like 10 minutes through the hills.

1210
01:05:09,900 --> 01:05:12,633
- He had time to do her.

1211
01:05:12,633 --> 01:05:14,200
And we know that the guy who was screwin' her

1212
01:05:14,200 --> 01:05:17,866
had time to do her (sighs).

1213
01:05:22,433 --> 01:05:25,500
- Man, now what are we gonna do?

1214
01:05:25,500 --> 01:05:27,566
- [Jack] So things were fine?

1215
01:05:27,566 --> 01:05:28,833
- I've told you guys.

1216
01:05:28,833 --> 01:05:30,133
We had a good marriage.

1217
01:05:30,133 --> 01:05:32,866
Sure, we had our problems.

1218
01:05:32,866 --> 01:05:35,366
- Look, this isn't easy, but I need to ask.

1219
01:05:35,366 --> 01:05:37,100
Is your wife having an affair?

1220
01:05:37,100 --> 01:05:38,333
- That's ridiculous.

1221
01:05:38,333 --> 01:05:39,266
- You're sure?

1222
01:05:39,266 --> 01:05:41,866
- Absolutely, Kim loved me.

1223
01:05:41,866 --> 01:05:43,566
- There was no one else?

1224
01:05:43,566 --> 01:05:45,066
- You know, you got one helluva nerve

1225
01:05:45,066 --> 01:05:47,266
comin' in here and crappin' all over my wife's reputation.

1226
01:05:47,266 --> 01:05:49,566
- (scoffs) Look, I don't care what your wife

1227
01:05:49,566 --> 01:05:52,633
did or didn't do, I'm here to solve a murder.

1228
01:05:52,633 --> 01:05:53,900
- Yeah, well, it looks like you're goin' about it

1229
01:05:53,900 --> 01:05:56,166
in a pretty half-assed way.

1230
01:05:58,333 --> 01:06:01,433
- You live in a big fantasy world here, don't you, Don?

1231
01:06:01,433 --> 01:06:04,000
With the big pool, the fancy cars, the parties.

1232
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:06,766
- I live well, what's your point?

1233
01:06:08,100 --> 01:06:11,833
- Your wife was seeing someone, we know that for a fact.

1234
01:06:11,833 --> 01:06:14,100
- There's physical evidence, Mr. White.

1235
01:06:14,100 --> 01:06:15,066
- It's garbage.

1236
01:06:15,066 --> 01:06:17,100
- Garbage (scoffs)?

1237
01:06:17,100 --> 01:06:18,966
I hate to rain on your parade, pal,

1238
01:06:18,966 --> 01:06:20,366
but the night your wife died,

1239
01:06:20,366 --> 01:06:23,666
she died full of semen, and you know what?

1240
01:06:23,666 --> 01:06:25,000
It wasn't yours.

1241
01:06:27,233 --> 01:06:30,233
- We've done all the tests.

1242
01:06:30,233 --> 01:06:34,000
Do you, um, have any idea who she was seeing?

1243
01:06:37,233 --> 01:06:38,500
- I don't know.

1244
01:06:40,066 --> 01:06:41,600
- Think harder.

1245
01:06:41,600 --> 01:06:43,433
- I said I don't know.

1246
01:06:47,333 --> 01:06:48,500
(Don clears his throat)

1247
01:06:48,500 --> 01:06:49,833
(chair rattling on floor)

1248
01:06:49,833 --> 01:06:51,666
You know your way out.

1249
01:06:57,800 --> 01:07:01,966
(blower humming over ominous orchestral music)

1250
01:07:18,900 --> 01:07:19,866
- How you doin'?

1251
01:07:19,866 --> 01:07:20,800
- Well, good.

1252
01:07:20,800 --> 01:07:22,100
- Pretty hot out today, huh?

1253
01:07:22,100 --> 01:07:23,566
- That's when I start real earning.

1254
01:07:23,566 --> 01:07:25,666
- You work out here on, uh, Saturdays?

1255
01:07:25,666 --> 01:07:27,400
- Oh, yes, every day I work.

1256
01:07:27,400 --> 01:07:29,066
Lots of property to take care of.

1257
01:07:29,066 --> 01:07:31,233
- Yeah, what time do you usually start?

1258
01:07:31,233 --> 01:07:34,033
- When the sun comes up, uh, five, six in the morning.

1259
01:07:34,033 --> 01:07:35,600
- Yeah, did you get that.

1260
01:07:35,600 --> 01:07:37,100
- Yeah.

1261
01:07:37,100 --> 01:07:39,700
- Um, do you remember anything unusual about last Saturday?

1262
01:07:39,700 --> 01:07:40,933
- Saturday?

1263
01:07:40,933 --> 01:07:42,533
- [Jack] The day when all the police came.

1264
01:07:42,533 --> 01:07:45,266
- No, nothing, I just remember the police.

1265
01:07:45,266 --> 01:07:49,600
- Any unusual noises, no screams, anything at all?

1266
01:07:49,600 --> 01:07:51,700
- No, nothing like that.

1267
01:07:51,700 --> 01:07:53,866
- How 'bout any, uh, strange vehicles you hadn't seen

1268
01:07:53,866 --> 01:07:56,333
in the neighborhood or in the driveway next door?

1269
01:07:56,333 --> 01:07:59,400
- Um, yeah, there was a blue utility vehicle

1270
01:07:59,400 --> 01:08:01,966
parked in the driveway when I first got to the house,

1271
01:08:01,966 --> 01:08:04,533
then I went inside to get my tools,

1272
01:08:04,533 --> 01:08:06,366
and then it was gone.

1273
01:08:06,366 --> 01:08:07,833
- Did you see who was driving?

1274
01:08:07,833 --> 01:08:10,566
- No, I'm sorry, I was inside.

1275
01:08:10,566 --> 01:08:13,333
- Huh, eh, you know what kind of car Mr. White,

1276
01:08:13,333 --> 01:08:14,733
your next door neighbor, drives?

1277
01:08:14,733 --> 01:08:16,466
- Oh, sure, everybody knows his Porsche.

1278
01:08:16,466 --> 01:08:17,700
It's a real nice car.

1279
01:08:17,700 --> 01:08:19,566
- Yeah, you didn't happen to see it

1280
01:08:19,566 --> 01:08:21,233
around that Saturday, did ya?

1281
01:08:21,233 --> 01:08:24,700
- No, not the Porsche, just that blue utility vehicle.

1282
01:08:24,700 --> 01:08:27,200
- OK, well, hey, you've been a big help.

1283
01:08:27,200 --> 01:08:28,033
Thanks a lot.

1284
01:08:28,033 --> 01:08:28,966
- OK.

1285
01:08:28,966 --> 01:08:29,899
- [Jack] Try to stay cool.

1286
01:08:29,899 --> 01:08:31,266
- Heh, thank you (chuckles).

1287
01:08:31,266 --> 01:08:32,500
- Nice, thank you.

1288
01:08:32,500 --> 01:08:36,166
(dramatic orchestral music)

1289
01:08:39,833 --> 01:08:43,266
(engine rumbles to life)

1290
01:08:44,700 --> 01:08:48,333
(engine rumbling over dramatic orchestral music and piano)

1291
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:55,166
(ominous and eerie orchestral music)

1292
01:09:10,566 --> 01:09:12,066
(traffic humming)

1293
01:09:12,066 --> 01:09:14,233
- [Jack] You don't own a utility vehicle, do ya?

1294
01:09:14,233 --> 01:09:15,466
- No.

1295
01:09:15,466 --> 01:09:16,899
- But you do own a car dealership?

1296
01:09:16,899 --> 01:09:19,899
- I sell foreign cars, I don't sell trucks.

1297
01:09:19,899 --> 01:09:21,066
- Do you know a friend of your wife

1298
01:09:21,066 --> 01:09:24,399
who drives one of these utility vehicles?

1299
01:09:27,933 --> 01:09:28,766
- Tim.

1300
01:09:28,766 --> 01:09:30,033
- Tim?

1301
01:09:30,033 --> 01:09:31,733
- [Don] Tim Marsh.

1302
01:09:31,733 --> 01:09:33,066
- Who is he?

1303
01:09:33,066 --> 01:09:34,833
- He's just an old friend from high school.

1304
01:09:34,833 --> 01:09:36,300
- What's he do?

1305
01:09:36,300 --> 01:09:38,566
- He is an accountant.

1306
01:09:38,566 --> 01:09:39,833
- Did he know your wife?

1307
01:09:39,833 --> 01:09:41,733
- Of course, came over all the time.

1308
01:09:41,733 --> 01:09:43,366
They were good friends.

1309
01:09:43,366 --> 01:09:44,933
- How good, lovers maybe?

1310
01:09:44,933 --> 01:09:47,533
- (scoffs) No.

1311
01:09:47,533 --> 01:09:48,899
- Was he at the party that night?

1312
01:09:48,899 --> 01:09:50,899
- Yes, yes, he was at the party.

1313
01:09:50,899 --> 01:09:53,666
- Did he go with you to the Century Club after the party?

1314
01:09:53,666 --> 01:09:54,900
- Nope, he went home.

1315
01:09:54,900 --> 01:09:56,300
- With his wife?

1316
01:09:56,300 --> 01:09:59,733
- She didn't come to the party, no.

1317
01:09:59,733 --> 01:10:03,000
- Look, I'm gonna ask you this once.

1318
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:05,333
Is your wife having an affair with Tim Marsh?

1319
01:10:05,333 --> 01:10:07,933
- (scoffs) No.

1320
01:10:12,800 --> 01:10:16,966
(water bubbling over chirping birds)

1321
01:10:21,433 --> 01:10:22,266
- Hi.

1322
01:10:23,633 --> 01:10:24,600
- Morning!

1323
01:10:24,600 --> 01:10:27,333
(birds chirping)

1324
01:10:30,266 --> 01:10:32,666
- I thought I heard you leave with the kids.

1325
01:10:32,666 --> 01:10:35,333
- I did, dropped 'em off at school.

1326
01:10:35,333 --> 01:10:38,600
Had a parent-teacher conference, came back, ate breakfast,

1327
01:10:38,600 --> 01:10:41,666
all before you even opened your eyes.

1328
01:10:43,933 --> 01:10:45,000
- I need to talk.

1329
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:47,233
- Sure, is something wrong?

1330
01:10:49,833 --> 01:10:52,600
- It's about Kim and everything that's happened

1331
01:10:52,600 --> 01:10:54,466
the last few days.

1332
01:10:54,466 --> 01:10:55,733
- Yeah, I know.

1333
01:10:57,033 --> 01:10:59,633
God, poor Don, I feel so bad for him.

1334
01:10:59,633 --> 01:11:01,500
It must be hard.

1335
01:11:01,500 --> 01:11:02,700
I mean, you always hear about these things

1336
01:11:02,700 --> 01:11:04,300
happening to other people,

1337
01:11:04,300 --> 01:11:06,933
and then when it happens to somebody close to you,

1338
01:11:06,933 --> 01:11:10,766
it just, I now just realized how lucky we are.

1339
01:11:13,700 --> 01:11:16,133
- It's still hard to believe.

1340
01:11:17,566 --> 01:11:19,566
- You look tired, honey.

1341
01:11:21,133 --> 01:11:23,000
- I am so sorry.

1342
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:24,833
- It's not your fault.

1343
01:11:25,866 --> 01:11:26,700
- Dammit!

1344
01:11:27,766 --> 01:11:30,433
- What is it, what's the matter?

1345
01:11:33,200 --> 01:11:35,366
(Tim sighs heavily)

1346
01:11:35,366 --> 01:11:36,766
- I was with her.

1347
01:11:38,500 --> 01:11:40,300
- With who, what are you talking about?

1348
01:11:40,300 --> 01:11:41,133
- Kim.

1349
01:11:42,633 --> 01:11:45,466
I was with her the night she died.

1350
01:11:46,766 --> 01:11:49,200
- Uh, what do you mean, with?

1351
01:11:51,266 --> 01:11:52,866
- I slept with her.

1352
01:11:54,333 --> 01:11:56,100
- You slept with her.

1353
01:11:56,100 --> 01:11:58,766
- Kim, I slept with Kim.

1354
01:11:58,766 --> 01:12:01,833
- With Kim, you slept with Kim White?

1355
01:12:05,533 --> 01:12:07,000
- I am so sorry.

1356
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:09,000
- Oh, you're sorry?

1357
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:10,400
Is that supposed to make it all better now,

1358
01:12:10,400 --> 01:12:11,900
that you're sorry?

1359
01:12:14,600 --> 01:12:16,500
God, Tim, you're pathetic!

1360
01:12:16,500 --> 01:12:18,766
What's the matter with you?

1361
01:12:18,766 --> 01:12:21,000
You stupid bastard! (slap thwacking)

1362
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:22,366
Get out of my house!

1363
01:12:22,366 --> 01:12:25,400
- I'm sorry, I didn't mean it!

1364
01:12:25,400 --> 01:12:27,000
I never wanted to hurt you!

1365
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:28,800
- Well, good, then you should've thought about that

1366
01:12:28,800 --> 01:12:31,833
before you cheated on me and slept with someone!

1367
01:12:31,833 --> 01:12:33,433
- I made a mistake!

1368
01:12:34,566 --> 01:12:36,633
(gasps) I never loved her, I loved you!

1369
01:12:36,633 --> 01:12:39,400
You, you need to know that!

1370
01:12:39,400 --> 01:12:42,166
- Loved me, is that why you slept with my friend?

1371
01:12:42,166 --> 01:12:44,433
Because you love me?

1372
01:12:44,433 --> 01:12:47,433
How many times, Tim, once, twice, what?

1373
01:12:47,433 --> 01:12:50,266
- Is was one time, I was drunk.

1374
01:12:50,266 --> 01:12:52,033
Can't you forgive me?

1375
01:12:55,766 --> 01:12:59,466
- 13 years of marriage, Tim, and our kids,

1376
01:12:59,466 --> 01:13:01,866
what am I supposed to tell them now?

1377
01:13:01,866 --> 01:13:05,733
Huh, Daddy fucked someone, but he's sorry now,

1378
01:13:05,733 --> 01:13:07,733
and he loves us!

1379
01:13:07,733 --> 01:13:08,566
Fuck you!

1380
01:13:10,666 --> 01:13:14,833
- Honey (panting), you're my life!

1381
01:13:15,733 --> 01:13:19,300
You're all I got (panting)!

1382
01:13:19,300 --> 01:13:21,200
I can't go on without you!

1383
01:13:21,200 --> 01:13:22,666
- Get out of my sight.

1384
01:13:22,666 --> 01:13:23,766
- Oh, Wendy--

1385
01:13:25,866 --> 01:13:27,866
- Get out, you're making me sick!

1386
01:13:27,866 --> 01:13:29,600
- God, what did I do?

1387
01:13:33,133 --> 01:13:33,966
- Get out!

1388
01:13:37,133 --> 01:13:37,966
- Wendy?

1389
01:13:37,966 --> 01:13:38,800
- Get out.

1390
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:43,933
(Wendy whimpering)

1391
01:13:52,666 --> 01:13:55,500
(traffic humming)

1392
01:14:01,400 --> 01:14:03,966
- [Liz] So you went home after the party?

1393
01:14:03,966 --> 01:14:05,000
- That's right.

1394
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:07,333
- About what time was that?

1395
01:14:07,333 --> 01:14:08,433
- Around one.

1396
01:14:09,866 --> 01:14:13,433
- Your wife was asleep when you got home, wasn't she?

1397
01:14:13,433 --> 01:14:14,900
- Yeah.

1398
01:14:14,900 --> 01:14:17,133
- It's not good, my friend.

1399
01:14:19,633 --> 01:14:23,033
- DMV says you drive a '93 utility vehicle.

1400
01:14:23,033 --> 01:14:24,266
- That's right.

1401
01:14:24,266 --> 01:14:27,933
- [Liz] And you're a friend of Don White's?

1402
01:14:27,933 --> 01:14:30,200
- Yes, I've known Donnie since high school.

1403
01:14:30,200 --> 01:14:31,433
- And his wife?

1404
01:14:33,200 --> 01:14:34,233
- I knew Kim.

1405
01:14:34,233 --> 01:14:36,000
- How well?

1406
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:37,933
- She was married to my best friend.

1407
01:14:37,933 --> 01:14:39,233
- You know, there's a little something tellin' me

1408
01:14:39,233 --> 01:14:42,166
that you knew her real well.

1409
01:14:42,166 --> 01:14:43,633
- What do you mean?

1410
01:14:43,633 --> 01:14:45,600
- Well, I got a little voice inside me that says

1411
01:14:45,600 --> 01:14:50,400
that you liked her so well that you wanted to screw her.

1412
01:14:50,400 --> 01:14:51,633
- That's crazy, I told you,

1413
01:14:51,633 --> 01:14:53,833
she was married to my best friend!

1414
01:14:53,833 --> 01:14:56,400
- Hey, it happens all the time.

1415
01:15:01,900 --> 01:15:03,566
- You don't have any evidence.

1416
01:15:03,566 --> 01:15:06,033
- Mm, we have an eyewitness.

1417
01:15:06,033 --> 01:15:10,033
He saw your car there the morning of the murder.

1418
01:15:12,700 --> 01:15:15,766
- I suggest you start telling the truth.

1419
01:15:15,766 --> 01:15:17,466
I've got enough right now to get a court order

1420
01:15:17,466 --> 01:15:20,766
to get a little sample of that precious little sperm,

1421
01:15:20,766 --> 01:15:24,933
and if it matches, I'm gonna nail your ass to the wall.

1422
01:15:35,566 --> 01:15:38,900
- Jesus Christ (sighs)!

1423
01:15:40,733 --> 01:15:42,466
- What happened?

1424
01:15:42,466 --> 01:15:44,466
- We had sex that night,

1425
01:15:45,733 --> 01:15:48,866
me and Kim, it was the first time.

1426
01:15:48,866 --> 01:15:50,500
- And you got excited and you wanted more,

1427
01:15:50,500 --> 01:15:52,400
so she said no and you hit her.

1428
01:15:52,400 --> 01:15:55,700
- No, that's not what happened.

1429
01:15:55,700 --> 01:15:56,533
- OK.

1430
01:15:59,733 --> 01:16:02,666
Tell me what it was like then.

1431
01:16:02,666 --> 01:16:06,833
- (sighs) We were flirting at the party.

1432
01:16:08,266 --> 01:16:09,766
We were drunk and,

1433
01:16:12,800 --> 01:16:14,633
after I went home, she called and she said

1434
01:16:14,633 --> 01:16:16,100
she was leaving the back door open

1435
01:16:16,100 --> 01:16:18,200
and that I should come over.

1436
01:16:18,200 --> 01:16:20,766
- She was a good-looking woman.

1437
01:16:20,766 --> 01:16:22,166
I can understand.

1438
01:16:24,633 --> 01:16:26,200
- So you went over.

1439
01:16:27,466 --> 01:16:29,566
- I was nervous, and I felt guilty, but Donnie,

1440
01:16:29,566 --> 01:16:31,933
I mean, he's the one who arranged it.

1441
01:16:31,933 --> 01:16:33,266
- Arranged what?

1442
01:16:34,700 --> 01:16:38,466
- He's the one who said I should sleep with his wife.

1443
01:16:38,466 --> 01:16:41,733
He said, he was playing all these weird mind games with me.

1444
01:16:41,733 --> 01:16:43,866
- He said that you should sleep with his wife?

1445
01:16:43,866 --> 01:16:48,100
- I know it sounds bizarre, but it's the truth.

1446
01:16:48,100 --> 01:16:49,466
He wanted me to take more risks,

1447
01:16:49,466 --> 01:16:51,266
he said my life was boring.

1448
01:16:51,266 --> 01:16:54,900
- So he wanted you to sleep with his wife?

1449
01:16:54,900 --> 01:16:59,600
Hell, man, I've got friends who think I'm timid,

1450
01:16:59,600 --> 01:17:04,166
but they don't let me go fucking their wife, though.

1451
01:17:04,166 --> 01:17:05,600
- He dared me to.

1452
01:17:07,600 --> 01:17:10,133
He let me use his cars,

1453
01:17:10,133 --> 01:17:11,900
let me use his house,

1454
01:17:14,666 --> 01:17:16,400
and he offered me Kim.

1455
01:17:16,400 --> 01:17:19,633
(dramatic piano and orchestral music)

1456
01:17:19,633 --> 01:17:21,866
I didn't kill her.

1457
01:17:21,866 --> 01:17:23,733
- You'll have to do better than that.

1458
01:17:23,733 --> 01:17:27,900
(tense and ominous orchestral music)

1459
01:17:32,233 --> 01:17:34,666
(Jack sighs)

1460
01:17:36,333 --> 01:17:38,533
- So, what do you think?

1461
01:17:38,533 --> 01:17:41,300
- I think he's full of shit.

1462
01:17:41,300 --> 01:17:43,900
Take him downtown, get a statement.

1463
01:17:43,900 --> 01:17:46,700
I'm gonna go get a warrant and tear this place apart.

1464
01:17:46,700 --> 01:17:50,866
(dramatic and ominous orchestral music)

1465
01:17:51,766 --> 01:17:54,433
(door rattling)

1466
01:17:57,533 --> 01:18:01,700
(distant traffic whooshing over ominous orchestral music)

1467
01:18:04,500 --> 01:18:06,833
- Hey, Lieutenant?

1468
01:18:06,833 --> 01:18:10,333
Lieutenant, I think we got something here.

1469
01:18:11,366 --> 01:18:13,166
- What do you got?

1470
01:18:13,166 --> 01:18:14,600
- I don't know, it looks like a club or something

1471
01:18:14,600 --> 01:18:16,800
wedged in there pretty tight.

1472
01:18:16,800 --> 01:18:19,033
Doesn't look like it belongs.

1473
01:18:19,033 --> 01:18:20,100
You want me to pull this out?

1474
01:18:20,100 --> 01:18:21,533
- Yeah.

1475
01:18:21,533 --> 01:18:25,300
(dramatic and ominous piano and orchestral music)

1476
01:18:43,933 --> 01:18:48,100
(increasingly ominous and tense orchestration)

1477
01:18:50,533 --> 01:18:53,133
Jesus Christ, let's go, inside.

1478
01:18:55,166 --> 01:18:56,566
- Sir?

1479
01:18:56,566 --> 01:18:59,300
- We got our man. (tense orchestral accent)

1480
01:18:59,300 --> 01:19:01,466
Gimme your hand, let's go.

1481
01:19:03,166 --> 01:19:05,066
You have the right to remain silent.

1482
01:19:05,066 --> 01:19:06,666
Anything you say can and will be used

1483
01:19:06,666 --> 01:19:08,566
against you in a court of law.

1484
01:19:08,566 --> 01:19:12,733
(dramatic and ominous orchestral music)

1485
01:19:16,666 --> 01:19:18,200
- They matched.

1486
01:19:18,200 --> 01:19:20,733
Lab found Marsh's prints on the bat.

1487
01:19:20,733 --> 01:19:23,400
- So we have the murder weapon and an eyewitness.

1488
01:19:23,400 --> 01:19:25,733
Son of a bitch is gonna fry.

1489
01:19:27,100 --> 01:19:28,400
What's bothering you?

1490
01:19:28,400 --> 01:19:31,166
(dramatic piano and orchestral music)

1491
01:19:31,166 --> 01:19:32,666
- Nothing.

1492
01:19:32,666 --> 01:19:37,033
- Aw, come on, I know you're thinking something there.

1493
01:19:37,033 --> 01:19:38,733
- Just a couple things bugging me.

1494
01:19:38,733 --> 01:19:39,866
- Like what?

1495
01:19:39,866 --> 01:19:41,400
- Don White, he took out

1496
01:19:41,400 --> 01:19:44,033
a life insurance policy on his wife.

1497
01:19:44,033 --> 01:19:45,033
- [Jack] So?

1498
01:19:46,400 --> 01:19:49,433
- It was three months before the murder.

1499
01:19:49,433 --> 01:19:51,200
- You got anything more?

1500
01:19:51,200 --> 01:19:53,700
- Just bothers me, that's all.

1501
01:19:54,800 --> 01:19:56,033
- Well, hey, I mean lots of people

1502
01:19:56,033 --> 01:20:00,133
take life insurance out on their spouses.

1503
01:20:00,133 --> 01:20:02,866
- It's for two million bucks, Jack.

1504
01:20:02,866 --> 01:20:05,833
- Hey, the Whites had the money, so why not?

1505
01:20:05,833 --> 01:20:10,733
Besides, it's a slam dunk, am I missing something?

1506
01:20:10,733 --> 01:20:12,233
- I don't know.

1507
01:20:12,233 --> 01:20:15,933
- Look, we've got the murder weapon with his fingerprints,

1508
01:20:15,933 --> 01:20:19,733
we have his semen, and he's admitted to banging her.

1509
01:20:19,733 --> 01:20:21,033
So what am I missing?

1510
01:20:21,033 --> 01:20:21,866
- Right.

1511
01:20:23,966 --> 01:20:24,800
Nothing.

1512
01:20:28,033 --> 01:20:29,800
- There's something still bothering you.

1513
01:20:29,800 --> 01:20:30,633
- No.

1514
01:20:30,633 --> 01:20:32,300
- No, you sure?

1515
01:20:32,300 --> 01:20:33,833
- Yep.

1516
01:20:33,833 --> 01:20:36,033
- Well, let's go get somethin' to eat.

1517
01:20:36,033 --> 01:20:37,233
Come on.

1518
01:20:37,233 --> 01:20:41,233
(dramatic and ominous orchestral music)

1519
01:20:44,566 --> 01:20:47,300
(birds chirping)

1520
01:20:51,500 --> 01:20:53,466
(knocking on door)

1521
01:20:53,466 --> 01:20:57,066
- Hi, I'm not interrupting anything, am I?

1522
01:20:57,066 --> 01:20:59,266
- No, not at all, come on in.

1523
01:20:59,266 --> 01:21:00,166
- Thanks.

1524
01:21:01,600 --> 01:21:05,766
(sighs) Everything's gonna be fine.

1525
01:21:07,666 --> 01:21:08,900
- Are you OK?

1526
01:21:08,900 --> 01:21:10,833
- Yeah, I'm holdin' up.

1527
01:21:11,966 --> 01:21:12,800
Oh.

1528
01:21:16,666 --> 01:21:19,333
(door rattling)

1529
01:21:30,100 --> 01:21:34,266
(rhythmic, vaguely unsettling electronic music)

1530
01:22:00,100 --> 01:22:03,533
(tense orchestral accent)

1531
01:22:04,633 --> 01:22:07,466
(traffic humming)

1532
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:18,100
- [Jack] What's up?

1533
01:22:18,100 --> 01:22:19,333
- [Liz] Nothin'.

1534
01:22:19,333 --> 01:22:22,500
- [Jack] Come on, I've been a cop for 17 years,

1535
01:22:22,500 --> 01:22:24,466
I know when something's bothering you.

1536
01:22:24,466 --> 01:22:26,500
- [Liz] It's the Marsh case.

1537
01:22:26,500 --> 01:22:27,700
- [Jack] What about it?

1538
01:22:27,700 --> 01:22:30,966
- Just, I just can't get it out of my system.

1539
01:22:30,966 --> 01:22:32,833
I mean, like the murder weapon.

1540
01:22:32,833 --> 01:22:35,900
Why not destroy it, why bury it in your backyard?

1541
01:22:35,900 --> 01:22:38,866
- Who knows, Marsh wasn't a brain surgeon.

1542
01:22:38,866 --> 01:22:41,700
(traffic humming)

1543
01:22:45,633 --> 01:22:47,966
You got anything new?

1544
01:22:47,966 --> 01:22:51,400
- Yeah, I talked with the insurance agent.

1545
01:22:51,400 --> 01:22:54,533
He sold the Whites their life insurance policy.

1546
01:22:54,533 --> 01:22:57,366
He said they were having all sorts of financial problems.

1547
01:22:57,366 --> 01:22:58,733
- Like what?

1548
01:22:58,733 --> 01:23:00,400
- Everything, the house in the hills

1549
01:23:00,400 --> 01:23:02,133
is mortgaged to the hilt,

1550
01:23:02,133 --> 01:23:05,100
the car dealerships are running huge losses.

1551
01:23:05,100 --> 01:23:08,600
(scoffs) Mr. Donald White was living a lie.

1552
01:23:08,600 --> 01:23:11,300
- Doesn't look good, but it doesn't prove anything.

1553
01:23:11,300 --> 01:23:14,333
Hell, lots of people in this town live on plastic.

1554
01:23:14,333 --> 01:23:17,766
- Yeah, but there's something else.

1555
01:23:17,766 --> 01:23:18,600
- What?

1556
01:23:21,600 --> 01:23:24,333
- Well, I went up to Soledad last week.

1557
01:23:24,333 --> 01:23:26,066
Just wanted to talk to Tim Marsh.

1558
01:23:26,066 --> 01:23:28,666
He told me the strangest thing.

1559
01:23:28,666 --> 01:23:30,300
He said his wife had dropped the kids off

1560
01:23:30,300 --> 01:23:33,133
at his mother's three weeks ago.

1561
01:23:33,133 --> 01:23:35,733
She said she needed a few day's rest.

1562
01:23:35,733 --> 01:23:39,666
(scoffs) Guess what?

1563
01:23:39,666 --> 01:23:42,533
She hasn't been seen or heard from since.

1564
01:23:42,533 --> 01:23:44,466
She's just disappeared.

1565
01:23:45,766 --> 01:23:48,266
- You're shitting me.

1566
01:23:48,266 --> 01:23:49,800
- No.

1567
01:23:49,800 --> 01:23:53,966
(traffic humming over tense orchestral music)

1568
01:24:02,100 --> 01:24:06,266
(dramatic, vaguely unsettling orchestral music)

1569
01:25:34,400 --> 01:25:37,566
(rhythmic percussion)

1570
01:25:43,900 --> 01:25:48,066
(eerie strings over rhythmic and murky ambient music)
