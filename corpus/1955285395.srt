1
00:00:00,242 --> 00:00:00,242
Â™ªâ™ª

2
00:00:06,950 --> 00:00:09,086
Most Of The Time
When You Think History,

3
00:00:09,119 --> 00:00:10,921
You Think Boring, Right?

4
00:00:10,953 --> 00:00:12,123
Ancient Civilizations

5
00:00:12,155 --> 00:00:14,958
With Names You Can't Pronounce,
Dates, Facts--

6
00:00:14,992 --> 00:00:16,127
I Mean, Who Cares?

7
00:00:16,159 --> 00:00:20,931
But Sometimes, History Can Slam
Right Into The Present

8
00:00:20,964 --> 00:00:23,468
And Totally Blow Your Mind.

9
00:00:32,809 --> 00:00:34,778
The First Ever
Movie Theater In Our Town

10
00:00:34,812 --> 00:00:36,980
Opened In 1925.

11
00:00:37,013 --> 00:00:40,284
<I>Phantom Of The Opera
Was Its First Film.

12
00:00:40,317 --> 00:00:43,154
But Times Changed.
Things Progressed,

13
00:00:43,187 --> 00:00:46,991
And The Old Movie Theater
Bit The Dust.

14
00:00:47,023 --> 00:00:48,124
Literally.

15
00:00:48,157 --> 00:00:51,795
There Was A Rumor That One Faithful,
Old Moviegoer

16
00:00:51,829 --> 00:00:53,297
Got Trapped Inside
When It Went Down.

17
00:00:53,330 --> 00:00:57,668
Some Folks Even Claimed
He Survived.

18
00:00:57,701 --> 00:00:59,537
Yeah, Right.

19
00:01:02,172 --> 00:01:04,809
Anyway, A New Theater
Was Built

20
00:01:04,841 --> 00:01:06,142
And New Movies
Were Shown

21
00:01:06,175 --> 00:01:08,178
And All The While,
The Legend Grew.

22
00:01:08,211 --> 00:01:10,981
Now Here I Am, 17,
Working At The Theater,

23
00:01:11,014 --> 00:01:12,482
And We Still
Talk About The Guy.

24
00:01:12,516 --> 00:01:15,820
Every Time A Piece Of Film Breaks Or The Lights Flicker,

25
00:01:15,853 --> 00:01:17,187
We Have Someone To Blame.

26
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:19,323
Not That I Believe
In Any Phantom.

27
00:01:19,356 --> 00:01:22,159
Truth Is, I've Got More
Important Things On My Mind.

28
00:01:22,192 --> 00:01:24,061
That's Me. Pete Riley.

29
00:01:24,094 --> 00:01:26,062
My Mom Thinks
I Work Way Too Hard,

30
00:01:26,095 --> 00:01:27,998
But She Really
Doesn't Get It.

31
00:01:28,031 --> 00:01:28,999
Do The Counts?

32
00:01:28,031 --> 00:01:28,999
Yeah.

33
00:01:29,032 --> 00:01:30,334
I'm The Youngest
Assistant Manager

34
00:01:30,367 --> 00:01:33,169
They've Ever Had
At This 26-Screen Megaplex.

35
00:01:33,202 --> 00:01:37,240
Hey, We're Talking Some Serious
Responsibility Here, Right?

36
00:01:37,273 --> 00:01:39,909
Do You Know
On A Typical Saturday Night

37
00:01:39,942 --> 00:01:41,177
We Have 52 People Working,

38
00:01:41,210 --> 00:01:43,346
Sell 88 Pounds
Of Popcorn,

39
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:47,051
Move 7,000 Patrons In And Out,
And Have 63 Showings

40
00:01:47,083 --> 00:01:50,186
With An Average Of 4-6 Minor Technical Glitches?

41
00:01:50,219 --> 00:01:54,624
Whew! That's A Lot
To Keep Track Of. Trust Me.

42
00:01:57,261 --> 00:02:00,030
That's Our Senior Manager,
Shawn Macgibbon.

43
00:02:00,062 --> 00:02:02,098
He's Freaking Out
Because Our Theater Owner,

44
00:02:02,132 --> 00:02:05,369
And Shawn's Personal Idol,
Wolfgang Nedermeyer,

45
00:02:05,401 --> 00:02:08,371
Scored Like
The Coup Of The Century.

46
00:02:08,405 --> 00:02:10,040
See, A Movie Called<I>
Midnight Mayhem

47
00:02:10,072 --> 00:02:11,909
Filmed Not Too Far From Here,
Last Spring...

48
00:02:11,941 --> 00:02:13,910
Nedermeyer Used
His Connections

49
00:02:13,943 --> 00:02:16,113
To Talk The Filmmakers
Into Coming Back,

50
00:02:16,145 --> 00:02:18,381
Right Here To Our Own
Grand Megaplex,

51
00:02:18,415 --> 00:02:21,918
For The Big-Time
Hollywood-Style World Premiere.

52
00:02:21,952 --> 00:02:23,220
Ok. Stop. Stop.

53
00:02:23,252 --> 00:02:24,888
We're Going To Need One Of Us

54
00:02:24,922 --> 00:02:26,222
On Either Side
And One In Back,

55
00:02:26,256 --> 00:02:27,258
Or Someone's
Going To End Up

56
00:02:27,291 --> 00:02:29,126
With A Major
Hernia, Ok?

57
00:02:29,159 --> 00:02:30,227
That's Ricky Leary...

58
00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:32,228
Or As We Call Him,
Ricky Rules.

59
00:02:32,262 --> 00:02:33,264
No Matter What You're Doing,

60
00:02:33,297 --> 00:02:35,132
Ricky's Got
The Procedure For It.

61
00:02:35,165 --> 00:02:37,101
You Know, Once I Heard

62
00:02:37,133 --> 00:02:39,403
These Kids Were Trying
To Push Something Like This,

63
00:02:39,435 --> 00:02:42,405
And It Started Rolling Backwards
And It Crushed Them,

64
00:02:42,439 --> 00:02:45,074
And One Kid Got Killed,
And The Other Ones Lost

65
00:02:45,108 --> 00:02:46,977
A Bunch Of Fingers,
Toes, And Junk.

66
00:02:47,010 --> 00:02:48,078
That's Terri Tortora...

67
00:02:48,110 --> 00:02:50,246
Nicknamed Scary Terri.

68
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:52,149
She's Got A Hundred
Stories To Tell,

69
00:02:52,181 --> 00:02:54,952
And All Of Them End In Death And Destruction.

70
00:02:54,984 --> 00:02:55,952
All Right.
Great, You Guys.

71
00:02:55,985 --> 00:02:57,387
Now, Um, Go Straighten Up
The Snack Bar.

72
00:02:57,421 --> 00:03:01,157
This Is Fantastic.
Look What A Great Job We're Doing, Honey.

73
00:03:01,191 --> 00:03:02,927
Aren't We So Efficient?

74
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:03,927
Hillary Horan...

75
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:06,095
A.K.A. Hillary Honey.

76
00:03:06,129 --> 00:03:08,097
She's Like Your Grandma
In A Teenage Body.

77
00:03:08,131 --> 00:03:10,167
Calls Everybody
Sweetie And Baby.

78
00:03:10,199 --> 00:03:12,168
Always Wants To Make Sure
We're Eating Enough,

79
00:03:12,202 --> 00:03:13,336
Wearing Warm Enough Clothes.

80
00:03:13,369 --> 00:03:14,971
Hey, Mark Could You Please Sweep Down

81
00:03:15,005 --> 00:03:15,972
The Carpet
For Me?

82
00:03:16,006 --> 00:03:17,007
With A Broom,
You Mean?

83
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:18,108
Mark Jefferies...

84
00:03:18,141 --> 00:03:20,977
Or As I Call Him,
Question Mark.

85
00:03:21,011 --> 00:03:22,112
You Can't Say
Anything To Him

86
00:03:22,144 --> 00:03:24,814
Without Getting A Hundred Questions In Response.

87
00:03:24,847 --> 00:03:26,049
Yeah, With The Broom.

88
00:03:32,221 --> 00:03:33,957
I Straightened Up
The Ticket Booth,

89
00:03:33,990 --> 00:03:35,091
Cleaned Both Ladies' Rooms,

90
00:03:35,125 --> 00:03:36,960
Washed The Popcorn Maker,
And Swept Inside The Elevator.

91
00:03:36,994 --> 00:03:37,961
Now I--

92
00:03:37,994 --> 00:03:40,296
Lacy Ling A.K.A.
Racy Lacy.

93
00:03:40,329 --> 00:03:42,365
Why Walk
If You Can Run?

94
00:03:42,399 --> 00:03:44,134
You Know What You Can Do For Me?

95
00:03:44,167 --> 00:03:45,135
Head Upstairs,

96
00:03:45,167 --> 00:03:46,302
Make Sure That
The Trash Cans

97
00:03:46,335 --> 00:03:48,037
Have Been Emptied,
And Then Check To See

98
00:03:48,071 --> 00:03:49,874
If That, Um,
Wind Machine Arrived

99
00:03:49,906 --> 00:03:51,842
For Our Hollywood Display.

100
00:03:52,675 --> 00:03:56,145
Read The Presentation Criteria
Checklist On My Booth Wall,

101
00:03:56,179 --> 00:03:58,549
And, Uh,
You'd Know That Digital Soundtrack Mis-Threading

102
00:03:58,582 --> 00:04:02,352
Is The Number One Cause
For, Uh, Customer Grievances.

103
00:04:02,386 --> 00:04:05,222
That Guy? He's Our
Head Projectionist, Merle.

104
00:04:05,255 --> 00:04:08,025
Ask A Simple Question,
Get A Way Too Complicated

105
00:04:08,058 --> 00:04:10,727
Technospeak Answer
In Return.

106
00:04:13,229 --> 00:04:14,765
Ahem.

107
00:04:16,032 --> 00:04:17,400
Slow It Down,
My Dear.

108
00:04:17,434 --> 00:04:21,873
Life Is Like A Good Movie:
Every Moment Should Be Savored.

109
00:04:25,107 --> 00:04:26,076
Meet Movie Mason.

110
00:04:26,109 --> 00:04:27,344
He Doesn't
Work Here.

111
00:04:27,376 --> 00:04:29,379
[Chuckling] He Just Thinks He Does.

112
00:04:29,412 --> 00:04:31,347
It Was Mason's Family
Who Opened

113
00:04:31,381 --> 00:04:34,351
The Original Theater On This Spot In The 1920s.

114
00:04:34,383 --> 00:04:37,220
Mason Loves Movies
More Than Anything.

115
00:04:37,254 --> 00:04:40,189
When They Tore His Place Down
To Build The Megaplex,

116
00:04:40,222 --> 00:04:43,026
He Had A Hard Time
Letting Go.

117
00:04:43,059 --> 00:04:44,528
My Schedule.

118
00:04:44,561 --> 00:04:49,233
So, Each Week Mason Types Up His Work Schedule,

119
00:04:49,266 --> 00:04:53,369
And Each Week
Shawn Files It.

120
00:04:53,403 --> 00:04:56,273
Still, Mason
Shows Up Every Day,

121
00:04:56,306 --> 00:04:58,242
And We're Always Happy
To See Him.

122
00:04:58,275 --> 00:05:02,246
Anyway, It's Not Only The Premiere I'm Pumped About.

123
00:05:02,278 --> 00:05:05,381
See There's This Girl,
Caitlin Kerigan,

124
00:05:05,415 --> 00:05:07,383
And I Got Her
And Her Friend Lisa

125
00:05:07,417 --> 00:05:09,887
Passes To An Early Movie
Into The Premiere.

126
00:05:09,919 --> 00:05:10,920
Not Bad, Huh?

127
00:05:10,953 --> 00:05:12,388
Now You Get Why Tonight

128
00:05:12,422 --> 00:05:17,227
Everything Has To Be Totally,
100 % Perfect.

129
00:05:17,259 --> 00:05:18,762
Aah!

130
00:05:17,259 --> 00:05:18,762
Whoa!

131
00:05:32,275 --> 00:05:34,578
I Cannot Stress Enough,
People,

132
00:05:34,611 --> 00:05:37,615
That On A Night As Monumental As This One

133
00:05:37,648 --> 00:05:42,419
Careers Are Going To Be Made
And Careers Will Be Broken.

134
00:05:42,451 --> 00:05:46,255
Tonight, As The Eyes Of
The Entertainment World

135
00:05:46,289 --> 00:05:48,158
Fall Upon Our
Humble Megaplex,

136
00:05:48,191 --> 00:05:50,594
What I Want Them
To See Is Greatness:

137
00:05:50,626 --> 00:05:53,263
Greatness That Can
Only Come From You Kids

138
00:05:53,295 --> 00:05:58,434
And The Rest Of My Crack
Saturday Night Team.

139
00:05:58,467 --> 00:05:59,503
To Quote Mr. Nedermeyer,

140
00:05:59,535 --> 00:06:02,105
"It Is Service
That Can't Be Beat

141
00:06:02,138 --> 00:06:04,141
That Puts A Butt
In Every Seat."

142
00:06:04,174 --> 00:06:05,609
I Expect To See
The Straightest Bow Ties,

143
00:06:05,641 --> 00:06:08,144
The Neatest Vests,
The Most Polished Shoes--

144
00:06:08,177 --> 00:06:09,479
Whoa. Shawn,
Are You Sure?

145
00:06:09,513 --> 00:06:12,282
Because Once I Heard These
Kids With Really Shiny Shoes--

146
00:06:12,314 --> 00:06:14,150
No, No, No.
Shusha, Shusha.

147
00:06:14,184 --> 00:06:17,354
Terri, Rise To My Level,
Or Be Gone.

148
00:06:17,386 --> 00:06:19,523
For Those Of You
Who

149
00:06:17,386 --> 00:06:19,523
Wish To

150
00:06:19,556 --> 00:06:24,995
I Expect To See You Back Here Promptly At 3:00

151
00:06:25,028 --> 00:06:26,295
To Start
Your Shifts.

152
00:06:26,328 --> 00:06:27,631
3:00 Today, You Mean?

153
00:06:27,664 --> 00:06:31,168
No, Mark. 3:00
A Year From Tuesday.

154
00:06:31,201 --> 00:06:32,903
[Cell Phone Rings]
Ahem.

155
00:06:34,237 --> 00:06:35,840
[Ring]

156
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:38,008
Yes.

157
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:40,309
Ahh, Mr. Nedermeyer.

158
00:06:40,342 --> 00:06:41,879
You Did?

159
00:06:44,213 --> 00:06:45,850
I See.

160
00:06:46,349 --> 00:06:47,384
No, No.

161
00:06:47,417 --> 00:06:50,220
If You Feel That Your Son-In-Law Is The Best Man

162
00:06:50,253 --> 00:06:51,354
For The General
Manager's Job,

163
00:06:51,388 --> 00:06:55,226
That's A Decision I Will Have To Respect.

164
00:06:56,359 --> 00:06:59,196
Of Course, Sir.
We'll See You Both, Tonight.

165
00:07:10,273 --> 00:07:13,277
We Are
Professionals.

166
00:07:14,244 --> 00:07:15,279
Ahem.

167
00:07:16,446 --> 00:07:19,883
And We Will
Act Like...

168
00:07:21,083 --> 00:07:22,251
Professionals.

169
00:07:22,285 --> 00:07:25,222
Um, On A--On
All Shows

170
00:07:25,254 --> 00:07:26,522
Before The Premiere
This Evening,

171
00:07:26,556 --> 00:07:28,358
We Will Get
The Customers In,

172
00:07:28,391 --> 00:07:30,561
Get Them Out,
But Always Be Kind And Courteous.

173
00:07:30,593 --> 00:07:34,363
In The Words
Of Mr. Nedermeyer,

174
00:07:34,396 --> 00:07:37,133
"A Smile
At Every Door..."

175
00:07:39,402 --> 00:07:41,205
"Keeps Them Coming Back
For More."

176
00:07:41,237 --> 00:07:43,573
Yes. Yes.

177
00:07:43,607 --> 00:07:46,277
You're A Good Man,
Pete.

178
00:07:47,410 --> 00:07:49,412
You Might Go Places In This Organization.

179
00:07:49,446 --> 00:07:51,215
And Since Mr. Nedermeyer Expects

180
00:07:51,247 --> 00:07:52,215
The Impossible
This Evening,

181
00:07:52,249 --> 00:07:53,617
If Anything
Does Go Wrong,

182
00:07:53,650 --> 00:07:56,087
I'm Fully Prepared
To Blame You.

183
00:07:57,287 --> 00:07:59,123
Dismissed!

184
00:08:23,179 --> 00:08:24,413
You Always
Do This To Me.

185
00:08:24,446 --> 00:08:25,749
You Tell Me You Want Me To Have A Life,

186
00:08:25,782 --> 00:08:27,451
So And Then I Make Plans With My Friends,

187
00:08:27,484 --> 00:08:28,585
And Then Suddenly,
At The Last Second,

188
00:08:28,617 --> 00:08:30,253
You Say You Need Me
To Baby-Sit.

189
00:08:30,286 --> 00:08:31,420
I Told You
Last Monday

190
00:08:31,453 --> 00:08:32,421
I Needed You
For Tonight.

191
00:08:32,454 --> 00:08:34,257
Was I Listening?

192
00:08:34,290 --> 00:08:35,258
Are You Ever?

193
00:08:35,291 --> 00:08:36,459
What's Up?

194
00:08:36,492 --> 00:08:38,594
Mom's Going Out
With George Tonight.

195
00:08:38,627 --> 00:08:40,597
Ahh! Think He Might
Finally Propose?

196
00:08:40,630 --> 00:08:43,266
Why Do You Guys Keep Pushing This?

197
00:08:43,299 --> 00:08:44,434
You And George
Are Great Together.

198
00:08:44,467 --> 00:08:45,501
You're Always Happy
When He's Around.

199
00:08:45,535 --> 00:08:46,770
Oh, Yeah.
You Know What You Should Do?

200
00:08:46,803 --> 00:08:48,272
You Should Be Like
Gillie Blake In

201
00:08:48,304 --> 00:08:49,305
<I>Always A Bridesmaid.

202
00:08:49,338 --> 00:08:50,473
Tell Him How Great
You Look In White,

203
00:08:50,506 --> 00:08:53,443
Ask Him If He Wants
To Play Old Maid,

204
00:08:53,476 --> 00:08:55,479
And Then Tell Him
You'll Give Him A Ring

205
00:08:55,511 --> 00:08:57,147
When You Get Home.

206
00:08:57,780 --> 00:09:00,349
Does Every Reference In Your
Life Have To Be From A Movie?

207
00:09:00,382 --> 00:09:01,684
Why Shouldn't It Be?

208
00:09:01,717 --> 00:09:04,487
You Sound Exactly Like The Grouchy Old Dad

209
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:05,521
In

210
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:05,521
<I>Blank Scree.

211
00:09:05,554 --> 00:09:06,823
Yeah, Well, I Just Think
It Would Be Cool

212
00:09:06,857 --> 00:09:09,458
If Every Once In A While You
Two Lived In The Real World.

213
00:09:09,492 --> 00:09:11,227
Boring.

214
00:09:12,194 --> 00:09:13,362
Now About George...

215
00:09:13,395 --> 00:09:16,466
George Will Propose If And When He's Ready.

216
00:09:16,498 --> 00:09:19,368
Yeah, But As Wendy Dillon
Said In <I>Maybe Baby,

217
00:09:19,401 --> 00:09:20,804
"Until You Apply
The Headlock...

218
00:09:20,837 --> 00:09:24,040
Sister And Brother:
He Might Never Comply With Wedlock."

219
00:09:26,509 --> 00:09:27,644
Mom, Can Karen
And I See

220
00:09:27,676 --> 00:09:29,512
<I>Farmer Brown Goes To Town, Tonight?

221
00:09:29,545 --> 00:09:31,647
Pete Said It's Not Going To Be Playing Much Longer,

222
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:33,482
And Tomorrow I've Got Baseball Practice All Day--

223
00:09:33,516 --> 00:09:35,519
Why Can't Pete Take Him When
He Goes To Work, Tonight?

224
00:09:35,551 --> 00:09:37,820
Then I Can Meet My Friends
To See <I>University Of Death.

225
00:09:37,853 --> 00:09:40,523
Oh, You're Not Seeing That
Movie With Or Without Brian.

226
00:09:40,557 --> 00:09:42,559
I Don't Like Those Bloody,
Sickening Things.

227
00:09:42,592 --> 00:09:44,494
I'm Not Asking You
To See It.

228
00:09:44,526 --> 00:09:46,395
Watch That Tone.

229
00:09:46,429 --> 00:09:47,831
I Hate My Life!

230
00:09:47,863 --> 00:09:50,566
You Still Treat Me
Like I'm 3 Years Old.

231
00:09:50,599 --> 00:09:51,701
Oh, I Do Not.

232
00:09:51,735 --> 00:09:54,371
Now Run In The House,
And I'll Fix You A Bottle.

233
00:09:54,404 --> 00:09:56,506
I'm Not Laughing,
Mom.

234
00:09:56,539 --> 00:09:59,076
Well, Start.
It Helps.

235
00:10:05,048 --> 00:10:09,419
Ok. Final Offer.
You And Brian Can Go See <I>Farmer Brown,

236
00:10:09,452 --> 00:10:11,388
Pete Can Drive You Home
On His Dinner Break,

237
00:10:11,420 --> 00:10:13,390
And Then You Only
Have To Be On Duty

238
00:10:13,423 --> 00:10:15,359
Till I Get Home
At Midnight.

239
00:10:15,391 --> 00:10:16,525
Sounds Sweet.

240
00:10:16,559 --> 00:10:18,227
To Who?

241
00:10:18,261 --> 00:10:19,395
To Whom.

242
00:10:19,429 --> 00:10:20,530
Tch!

243
00:10:20,563 --> 00:10:21,597
Take It
Or Leave It, Hon.

244
00:10:21,631 --> 00:10:22,698
And Even If I Didn't
Have A Date,

245
00:10:22,732 --> 00:10:24,701
I Wouldn't Let You See<I>
College Of Blood.

246
00:10:24,733 --> 00:10:27,703
Mom, It's <I>University Of Death.

247
00:10:27,737 --> 00:10:30,207
Yeah, Well,
Same Difference.

248
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:32,109
Ugh!

249
00:10:47,256 --> 00:10:48,257
Slow Down, Grog.

250
00:10:48,291 --> 00:10:50,593
Nobody's Going To Steal Your Woolly Mammoth Meat.

251
00:10:50,626 --> 00:10:52,462
Hmm! I'm Starving.

252
00:10:52,495 --> 00:10:53,463
Obviously.

253
00:10:53,496 --> 00:10:55,732
How Did It Go
Down At The Theater?

254
00:10:55,765 --> 00:10:58,568
Oh, It Was So Cool.
Me And Ricky We Had To--

255
00:10:58,601 --> 00:10:59,636
Ricky And I.

256
00:10:59,669 --> 00:11:00,770
Ricky And I,
We Had To Put

257
00:11:00,804 --> 00:11:03,774
This Huge Monster Blow-Up Thing
Above The Main Marquee.

258
00:11:03,807 --> 00:11:05,742
They Had You
Up On The Roof?

259
00:11:05,775 --> 00:11:08,444
Yeah, Mom. And I Fell Off,
Cracked My Skull,

260
00:11:08,477 --> 00:11:09,445
And Now I'm Dead.

261
00:11:09,478 --> 00:11:11,814
Ha Ha. Just For The Record,
I Don't Approve.

262
00:11:11,847 --> 00:11:14,918
Uh, Ooh, Listen.
I Realize I Should Have Checked With You First,

263
00:11:14,950 --> 00:11:16,919
But Would It Be Ok
For You To Drive

264
00:11:16,953 --> 00:11:18,755
The Littles Home
On Your Break, Tonight?

265
00:11:18,788 --> 00:11:20,823
They'll Be Long Gone Before The Start Of The Premiere.

266
00:11:20,857 --> 00:11:23,760
[Sighs] That's Not What I'm Worried About.

267
00:11:23,793 --> 00:11:24,928
Caitlin's Coming By.

268
00:11:24,961 --> 00:11:27,764
I Snagged Her And A Friend
Passes For An Earlier Movie

269
00:11:27,796 --> 00:11:29,498
And Then To Stay
For The Premiere.

270
00:11:29,531 --> 00:11:31,600
They Won't Bother You.
I'll Make Them Promise.

271
00:11:31,634 --> 00:11:33,437
Oh, I Just Don't Want
Them Coming Up

272
00:11:33,469 --> 00:11:35,471
And Making Dumb Comments
And Stuff.

273
00:11:35,505 --> 00:11:37,607
Pete, You Know
How Those Two Are.

274
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:38,809
Bombs Could Be Going Off When They're

275
00:11:38,842 --> 00:11:40,943
Watching A Movie,
And It Wouldn't Distract Them.

276
00:11:40,977 --> 00:11:42,846
Exactly Like Your Father That Way.

277
00:11:42,878 --> 00:11:46,482
Who Loved The Movies
More Than Dad?

278
00:11:47,650 --> 00:11:50,154
Yeah.

279
00:11:50,886 --> 00:11:53,489
Sometimes I Wonder
If That's Why

280
00:11:53,522 --> 00:11:54,924
You Ended Up
At The Megaplex.

281
00:11:54,958 --> 00:11:58,794
Well, No Disrespect, Mom,
But I'm In It Strictly For The Cold, Hard Cash.

282
00:11:58,828 --> 00:12:03,632
Uh, Yeah. Um,
Speaking Of Which,

283
00:12:03,665 --> 00:12:05,635
Don't You Think You've Been Putting In

284
00:12:05,668 --> 00:12:06,970
Too Many Hours
Down There?

285
00:12:07,002 --> 00:12:11,174
We Go Over This Every Month.
The Answer Is Still, No.

286
00:12:11,207 --> 00:12:11,908
I Love My Job.

287
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:13,976
Yeah, But All Work
And No Play--

288
00:12:14,010 --> 00:12:15,812
Is Going To Make Me
Really, Really Rich.

289
00:12:15,844 --> 00:12:18,681
And Burned Out
Before You're 30.

290
00:12:18,714 --> 00:12:21,684
Pete, You're Young.
You Have Plenty Of Years To Work.

291
00:12:21,717 --> 00:12:22,886
You Should Be Out
Enjoying Yourself.

292
00:12:22,919 --> 00:12:28,525
Mom, Don't Worry
About It. I'm Fine.

293
00:12:28,558 --> 00:12:29,592
Ok.

294
00:12:32,194 --> 00:12:35,665
Tonight Sounds Like It's Going
To Be Pretty Great, Though.

295
00:12:35,698 --> 00:12:37,867
Klieg Lights, Limousines,
Movie Stars.

296
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:40,737
Karen Said Sarah Joan Michelle Whatever,

297
00:12:40,770 --> 00:12:42,838
Was Going To
Be There.

298
00:12:42,871 --> 00:12:45,508
Madison Ashley Metz, Mom.

299
00:12:45,541 --> 00:12:47,210
Isn't That
What I Said?

300
00:12:48,877 --> 00:12:50,847
No, Really,
It Sounds So Exciting.

301
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:52,716
Are You Nervous?

302
00:12:52,748 --> 00:12:53,716
Mom, We're
Professionals.

303
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:55,753
We Have Everything
Under Control.

304
00:12:56,919 --> 00:12:59,722
It's A Disaster, A Total
Calamity.

305
00:12:59,756 --> 00:13:01,690
I Am Talking
Fade Out. The End.

306
00:13:01,723 --> 00:13:02,691
What's Going On?

307
00:13:02,724 --> 00:13:04,860
Craig And Randy Just Both Phoned In Sick.

308
00:13:04,894 --> 00:13:07,864
And Jenna, Well,
She's Simply Lost In The Ozone.

309
00:13:07,896 --> 00:13:09,932
How Can Nearly Half Our Staff Pick Tonight,

310
00:13:09,966 --> 00:13:12,702
Of All Nights,
To Simply Not Show Up?

311
00:13:12,735 --> 00:13:14,704
And Nedermeyer Keeps Calling Every 5 Minutes

312
00:13:14,737 --> 00:13:15,738
To See How
It's Going.

313
00:13:15,771 --> 00:13:16,739
He Keeps Telling Me
This Premiere

314
00:13:16,772 --> 00:13:18,074
Has To Go Off
Without A Flaw.

315
00:13:18,107 --> 00:13:21,578
Without A Hitch.
Without One Single-- [Hiccup]

316
00:13:22,745 --> 00:13:24,081
Oh, No.
Oh, No, No.

317
00:13:24,113 --> 00:13:25,881
You See,
When I Get Nervous I-- [Hiccup]

318
00:13:25,915 --> 00:13:28,785
Go! Get Me Water
From The Snack Bar.

319
00:13:28,818 --> 00:13:30,720
Flat, No Bubbles.
Go!

320
00:13:30,752 --> 00:13:32,256
Ok.

321
00:13:34,591 --> 00:13:35,626
[Hiccup]

322
00:13:40,597 --> 00:13:41,631
Heard The Latest?

323
00:13:41,664 --> 00:13:42,766
Since We're
So Understaffed,

324
00:13:42,799 --> 00:13:44,900
All Breaks And Dinner Hours Have Been Cancelled,

325
00:13:44,934 --> 00:13:47,904
Which Is <I>Huge Violation
Of Our Union Contract.

326
00:13:47,937 --> 00:13:49,773
Ahem.

327
00:13:47,937 --> 00:13:49,773
But I Guess
Tonight's

328
00:13:49,805 --> 00:13:50,773
Not The Night
To Get Into

329
00:13:50,807 --> 00:13:52,476
Shawn's Face
About It.

330
00:13:52,509 --> 00:13:53,777
Good Instincts, Ricky.

331
00:13:53,809 --> 00:13:56,946
I Heard Once, These Kids
At This Restaurant

332
00:13:56,980 --> 00:13:57,981
Didn't Get
Their Dinner Break,

333
00:13:58,014 --> 00:14:00,750
And They All
Started Fainting.

334
00:14:00,783 --> 00:14:01,918
And Then--

335
00:14:01,950 --> 00:14:04,753
Blood, Guts, Death, Destruction.
I Mean, Come On, Terri.

336
00:14:04,786 --> 00:14:06,756
Like We Haven't Heard It,
Like, A Thousand Times.

337
00:14:06,789 --> 00:14:07,823
We're Never Going To Get Through This.

338
00:14:07,857 --> 00:14:09,626
Even If We Didn't Have
The Premiere,

339
00:14:09,659 --> 00:14:11,428
This Is Way Too Much Stu
For Us To Handle.

340
00:14:11,461 --> 00:14:12,195
Hey, Tough Up, Rookies.

341
00:14:12,228 --> 00:14:14,930
To Quote Shawn
Quoting Nedermeyer,

342
00:14:14,963 --> 00:14:16,766
"If You Don't
Want To Get Canned,

343
00:14:16,799 --> 00:14:18,635
Give Your Very Best
To The Grand."

344
00:14:18,668 --> 00:14:20,169
Now Make This Bigger.

345
00:14:20,203 --> 00:14:22,005
Are You Bringing That To Put Up
The Net For The Balloon Drop?

346
00:14:22,038 --> 00:14:24,941
Check It Out.
Shawn's Completely 3 Steps Ahead Of You Guys.

347
00:14:24,973 --> 00:14:27,943
Man, Is He Dedicated
Or What?

348
00:14:27,977 --> 00:14:30,012
Even Though He Didn't Get
The General Manager Job,

349
00:14:30,045 --> 00:14:32,482
He's Still Hustling
Like A Maniac.

350
00:14:35,517 --> 00:14:38,821
[Evil Laugh]

351
00:14:38,855 --> 00:14:40,790
Now Listen.
We Need To Figure This Out

352
00:14:40,823 --> 00:14:42,225
Before My Mom Gets
Out Of The Shower.

353
00:14:42,257 --> 00:14:44,994
So She's Dropping Brian And Me Off
At 7:30 For A 7:40 <I>Farmer Brown.

354
00:14:45,027 --> 00:14:47,830
So I Need To Do The 7:50<I>
University Of Death

355
00:14:47,863 --> 00:14:49,632
So I Can Get
Brian All Settled,

356
00:14:49,665 --> 00:14:51,501
Then Can Sit
With You Guys.

357
00:14:52,901 --> 00:14:54,670
I Told Her It Was Pg-13.

358
00:14:54,703 --> 00:14:55,671
But She's Still
All Freaked Out.

359
00:14:55,704 --> 00:14:57,473
Thinks It's Going To Be
Too Violent And--

360
00:14:57,506 --> 00:14:59,675
I--I Totally Agree.

361
00:14:59,708 --> 00:15:01,810
We See Worse Things
On The 6:00 News.

362
00:15:01,843 --> 00:15:03,179
Ok, Perfect.

363
00:15:03,213 --> 00:15:07,384
So I'll See You Guys, Outside, 7:50,<I>
University Of Death.

364
00:15:07,416 --> 00:15:07,983
Ok, Bye.

365
00:15:08,017 --> 00:15:09,185
<I>University Of Death?

366
00:15:09,218 --> 00:15:12,655
You're Supposed To See<I>
Farmer Brown With Me.

367
00:15:12,689 --> 00:15:13,589
Remember?

368
00:15:13,623 --> 00:15:15,558
Look. I'll Get You In.
I'll Get You Settled.

369
00:15:15,592 --> 00:15:16,860
Yeah, Right.
Then Ditch Me.

370
00:15:16,892 --> 00:15:18,327
Like You're Going
To Even Notice.

371
00:15:18,361 --> 00:15:21,064
What If It Turns Into, Like,<I>
Waldorf's Revenge?

372
00:15:21,097 --> 00:15:23,033
Where That, You Know,
Criminal Guy Runs Into

373
00:15:23,065 --> 00:15:26,669
The Theater And Grabs That Innocent Kid Hostage?

374
00:15:26,703 --> 00:15:27,837
That Won't Happen, Brian.

375
00:15:27,870 --> 00:15:29,039
Or--Or What If
It's Like In <I>Flood?

376
00:15:29,072 --> 00:15:31,708
And The Whole Place Starts To Flood,
But I'm [Gurgling]

377
00:15:32,742 --> 00:15:33,910
Trapped?

378
00:15:33,943 --> 00:15:36,078
Or What If I Pay You
5 Bucks And Take You To See

379
00:15:36,112 --> 00:15:39,583
Power Penguins Foiling
Big Glory Next Weekend?

380
00:15:39,616 --> 00:15:41,885
10 Bucks And 2 Movies.

381
00:15:41,918 --> 00:15:46,556
10 Bucks, <I>Power Penguins,
And A Large Candy

382
00:15:46,588 --> 00:15:48,857
Let Me Think About It.

383
00:15:48,891 --> 00:15:50,727
Hmm. Let Me Think About What?

384
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:53,029
Ohh, Uh. Whether He, Um,

385
00:15:53,062 --> 00:15:56,900
Whether He Wants To
Wash Or Dry The Dishes.

386
00:15:56,933 --> 00:15:59,569
Mm-Hmm.

387
00:16:03,072 --> 00:16:04,874
Movie Mason: Good Evening.
Enjoy The Show.

388
00:16:04,906 --> 00:16:07,042
Enjoy The Show, Sir.
Enjoy The Show.

389
00:16:07,075 --> 00:16:09,712
Uh, Hello, Mrs, Johnson.
I Love Your Earrings.

390
00:16:09,746 --> 00:16:10,880
Hello, Gentlemen.
How Are You?

391
00:16:10,913 --> 00:16:13,650
Hey, Movie Mason.
Rippin' Tux.

392
00:16:16,986 --> 00:16:18,655
Uh, Enjoy The Show.

393
00:16:20,990 --> 00:16:22,592
Female Employee: Next.

394
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:24,727
Uhh, Uhh!

395
00:16:24,761 --> 00:16:27,896
Oh, One More Try.

396
00:16:27,929 --> 00:16:29,598
No.

397
00:16:29,631 --> 00:16:31,434
Next!

398
00:16:34,002 --> 00:16:34,970
May I Have Some
Nachos, Please,

399
00:16:35,003 --> 00:16:36,238
With Some
Extra Cheese?

400
00:16:36,271 --> 00:16:38,073
Female Customer: Can I Get
A Large Soda, Please?

401
00:16:38,107 --> 00:16:40,110
Ok, You've Got Enough
Popcorn Tubs, Lids.

402
00:16:40,142 --> 00:16:41,777
Looks Like All
You Need Now Is Cups.

403
00:16:41,810 --> 00:16:42,911
And Straws, Ok?

404
00:16:42,944 --> 00:16:45,448
Cups And Straws.
Cups And Straws.

405
00:16:46,848 --> 00:16:48,751
Lookin',
Sharp There, Petey.

406
00:16:48,785 --> 00:16:50,987
What're You
Doing Here, Hollie?

407
00:16:51,020 --> 00:16:54,090
We Heard Caitlin And Lisa Were
Going To Be Around, Tonight.

408
00:16:54,122 --> 00:16:56,759
What Movie Did You
Give Them Passes For?

409
00:16:56,793 --> 00:16:57,994
I Forget, Ok?

410
00:16:58,026 --> 00:17:00,663
I'm Busy.

411
00:17:01,864 --> 00:17:04,100
Why Does That Dog Make It So Easy

412
00:17:04,133 --> 00:17:06,837
For Me To Rattle
His Cage?

413
00:17:08,037 --> 00:17:11,808
My Whole Life Donny Hollie's
Been Like Some Dark Shadow.

414
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:13,943
In School,
Sports, Girls.

415
00:17:13,975 --> 00:17:15,811
If I Want It,
He Wants It.

416
00:17:15,845 --> 00:17:17,113
He's The One
Who Usually Gets It.

417
00:17:17,145 --> 00:17:19,982
Well, Does He Know That You Like Caitlin, Hon?

418
00:17:20,015 --> 00:17:23,285
Think It's Just A Coincidence He Showed Up, Tonight?

419
00:17:23,318 --> 00:17:24,953
Now I'll Be Working
My Buns Off,

420
00:17:24,986 --> 00:17:27,790
He'll Hunt Her Down,
Pour On Some Of His Gross Charm.

421
00:17:27,824 --> 00:17:29,959
I Hate Donny.

422
00:17:29,992 --> 00:17:31,328
You Know, Never Worked
A Day In His Life.

423
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:34,129
All The Girls Think
He's Just So Good Looking.

424
00:17:34,163 --> 00:17:36,132
He's Has
A Totally Perfect Life.

425
00:17:36,165 --> 00:17:38,568
But You Are So
Way Sweeter, Doll.

426
00:17:39,836 --> 00:17:41,304
Since When Does
That Count For Anything?

427
00:17:41,337 --> 00:17:45,141
You Know, Girls Like Caitlin
Want Guys With Decent Cars,

428
00:17:45,174 --> 00:17:47,010
You Know, Money To Spend
On Dates.

429
00:17:47,042 --> 00:17:49,812
I'm Earning Cash
Just To Compete.

430
00:17:49,846 --> 00:17:51,047
Woman: This Is
Ridiculous!

431
00:17:51,079 --> 00:17:52,715
Second Woman:
Hey, Don't Push.

432
00:17:52,749 --> 00:17:54,550
I Understand It.

433
00:17:55,184 --> 00:17:56,985
Girl: This Is Taking
Forever!

434
00:17:57,019 --> 00:17:58,054
Woman: Why?

435
00:17:58,087 --> 00:18:00,155
Hey, Zeke,
What's The Deal?

436
00:18:00,188 --> 00:18:01,857
Shouldn't Shawn Open Up
Another Line?

437
00:18:01,890 --> 00:18:03,025
There's Nobody
To Man It, Man.

438
00:18:03,059 --> 00:18:05,161
It's Crazy!
Workin' My Fingers Off Here.

439
00:18:05,193 --> 00:18:06,195
Not Tonight, Man.

440
00:18:06,229 --> 00:18:07,364
Whoa, Folks.
Settle Down.

441
00:18:07,396 --> 00:18:10,066
Look, Everybody's Going To Make It Inside,
All Right?

442
00:18:10,098 --> 00:18:11,902
Eventually.

443
00:18:12,934 --> 00:18:15,038
Young Shawn,
When Can I Expect You

444
00:18:15,070 --> 00:18:18,006
To Respond To My Proposal
About Putting A Live Organ--

445
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:19,843
Not Now, Mason.
I'm Swamped, Ok?

446
00:18:19,876 --> 00:18:20,911
How's It Going, Men?

447
00:18:20,943 --> 00:18:23,680
You've Got To Get Us Some Help, Boss.
This Is Weak.

448
00:18:23,713 --> 00:18:24,681
Am I Houdini?

449
00:18:24,713 --> 00:18:26,049
Am I Supposed To Pull An Employee Out Of My Hat?

450
00:18:26,081 --> 00:18:27,349
Relax, Young Shawn.

451
00:18:27,383 --> 00:18:30,019
I Would Gladly Abandon
My Greater Post

452
00:18:30,051 --> 00:18:32,020
To Answer The Desperate
Call To Arms

453
00:18:32,053 --> 00:18:34,189
To Become A Ticket Taker.

454
00:18:34,222 --> 00:18:35,924
There's Only
One Problem, Mason.

455
00:18:35,957 --> 00:18:37,860
You Don't Work Here. Ok?

456
00:18:37,894 --> 00:18:38,928
Now You Tell Him.

457
00:18:38,961 --> 00:18:41,731
A Man In Crisis
Should Not Be Burdened

458
00:18:41,763 --> 00:18:43,065
By Irrelevant Details.

459
00:18:43,098 --> 00:18:45,734
So You'd Stand Here
And Take Tickets

460
00:18:45,768 --> 00:18:47,738
Even If I Can't Pay You?

461
00:18:48,404 --> 00:18:52,742
Shawn, Movies Are Not
About Commerce, My Friend.

462
00:18:52,774 --> 00:18:54,209
Movies Are About Magic.

463
00:18:55,241 --> 00:18:57,046
Is That A Yes Or A No?

464
00:18:57,078 --> 00:19:00,584
Hey, If He Wants To Do It, Shawn,
Let Him.

465
00:19:12,261 --> 00:19:14,129
Not Since I Was Made
Head Usher

466
00:19:14,163 --> 00:19:17,232
At The Saul And Gettle
Sand Palace Of Burlesque

467
00:19:17,265 --> 00:19:20,235
Has My Heart Been Filled
With Such Pride.

468
00:19:20,269 --> 00:19:22,905
In The Name Of The Great
Cecil B. De Mille,

469
00:19:22,938 --> 00:19:24,406
I Will Not Let You Down.

470
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:28,244
Whatever. Just Stand There,
Hand Half The Ticket Back,

471
00:19:28,277 --> 00:19:29,913
And Keep The People Moving.

472
00:19:29,945 --> 00:19:31,915
Watch Him.

473
00:19:31,947 --> 00:19:33,315
[Cell Phone Rings]

474
00:19:33,348 --> 00:19:37,753
Oh, Nedermeyer Will Not Be Happy
Until I Have A Nervous Breakdown.

475
00:19:37,787 --> 00:19:38,822
Hey, Mason.

476
00:19:38,855 --> 00:19:40,924
Hello, Son.
Enjoy The Show.

477
00:19:40,956 --> 00:19:43,091
Oh, I Take This.

478
00:19:43,125 --> 00:19:44,093
Thank You.

479
00:19:44,126 --> 00:19:45,828
Here, This Is
The Other Half.

480
00:19:46,361 --> 00:19:48,330
Make Sure Pete
Knows You're Here.

481
00:19:48,364 --> 00:19:49,999
Don't Leave The Theater Without Him,

482
00:19:50,031 --> 00:19:51,266
And Don't
Talk To Strangers.

483
00:19:51,299 --> 00:19:53,136
You Have Money And My Pager Number, Right?

484
00:19:53,168 --> 00:19:54,169
Mom, We're Going To See
A Movie,

485
00:19:54,203 --> 00:19:56,105
Not Crossing The Atlantic
In A Canoe.

486
00:19:56,137 --> 00:19:58,006
George: Trust Them,
Pocahontas.

487
00:19:58,040 --> 00:19:59,274
Hey, They've
Got This Wired.

488
00:19:59,308 --> 00:20:01,176
See, Look! George Gets It!

489
00:20:01,210 --> 00:20:03,346
Besides, Mom,
It's Not Even Dark Yet.

490
00:20:03,378 --> 00:20:05,280
Plus, Since They Hired
Those Cinema Sitters,

491
00:20:05,313 --> 00:20:07,015
We Couldn't Get
Away With Anything

492
00:20:07,049 --> 00:20:08,852
Even If We Wanted To.

493
00:20:08,885 --> 00:20:10,819
Well, Good.
Love You Guys.

494
00:20:10,853 --> 00:20:12,355
Love You, Too.

495
00:20:12,387 --> 00:20:15,191
Remember, No Headlock,
No Wedlock.

496
00:20:15,223 --> 00:20:17,961
Go On! Get Out Of Here!

497
00:20:17,993 --> 00:20:19,294
And No <I>Corpse School!

498
00:20:19,328 --> 00:20:22,365
I'm Guessing She Means <I>University Of Death.

499
00:20:22,397 --> 00:20:25,467
George: So, What
Was That All About?

500
00:20:25,501 --> 00:20:28,203
Nothing.
They Are Genuinely Crazy About You, George,

501
00:20:28,236 --> 00:20:31,674
And You Have No Idea How Flattered You Should Be.

502
00:20:33,509 --> 00:20:35,377
First Female: What's The Hold-Up?
What's Going On?

503
00:20:35,411 --> 00:20:36,813
First Male:
What's The Hold-Up?

504
00:20:36,846 --> 00:20:37,547
Second Male: Any Night!

505
00:20:37,579 --> 00:20:38,982
Third Male: Let's Go!
Let's Go!

506
00:20:39,014 --> 00:20:41,016
Go See Why
We're Not Moving, Bri.

507
00:20:41,049 --> 00:20:42,184
I'll Hold Our Place.

508
00:20:42,218 --> 00:20:44,053
Ok.

509
00:20:44,086 --> 00:20:45,154
Fourth Male: Hey,
Is That Kid Cutting In Line?

510
00:20:45,186 --> 00:20:46,054
Fifth Male: Man!

511
00:20:46,088 --> 00:20:49,024
Second Female:
I Need Some Air.

512
00:20:49,058 --> 00:20:50,225
Sixth Male: Hurry Up!

513
00:20:50,259 --> 00:20:52,328
Third Female: Come On!
What's The Hold-Up?

514
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:53,228
Mason: I'm Sorry.

515
00:20:53,261 --> 00:20:54,230
We Appreciate
Your Opinion, Guy.

516
00:20:54,262 --> 00:20:55,397
We Just Don't
Happen To Care.

517
00:20:55,431 --> 00:20:58,501
Considering The Steep Cost Of The Ticket, Friend,

518
00:20:58,533 --> 00:21:01,337
I'm Simply Hoping
To Maximize The Pleasure

519
00:21:01,369 --> 00:21:03,338
Of Your Movie-Going
Experience

520
00:21:03,372 --> 00:21:06,209
By Telling You That
The Film You've Selected

521
00:21:06,242 --> 00:21:08,243
Is What
We In The Industry

522
00:21:08,277 --> 00:21:10,413
Commonly Refer To
As A Stinker.

523
00:21:10,445 --> 00:21:13,182
Mason,
They Don't Want To Hear

524
00:21:13,214 --> 00:21:14,183
Your Opinion, All Right?

525
00:21:14,215 --> 00:21:15,717
You're Backing The Lines Up

526
00:21:15,751 --> 00:21:16,352
Into Next Thursday.

527
00:21:16,385 --> 00:21:18,186
Be That As It May,
My Boy,

528
00:21:18,220 --> 00:21:19,355
Cinema Is Sacred.

529
00:21:19,387 --> 00:21:22,090
Each Experience
Should Transport Us

530
00:21:22,124 --> 00:21:24,360
To A World
Worthy Of Our Time

531
00:21:24,393 --> 00:21:26,362
And Hard-Earned Cash.

532
00:21:26,395 --> 00:21:29,898
Listen, Why Don't You
Just Take Our Tickets

533
00:21:29,932 --> 00:21:30,934
And Let Us In, Buddy!

534
00:21:30,966 --> 00:21:31,934
First Man: Yeah!

535
00:21:31,968 --> 00:21:33,036
Second Man: Come On!

536
00:21:33,068 --> 00:21:34,937
Woman: Come On, Mason!

537
00:21:34,971 --> 00:21:35,872
So, What Happened?

538
00:21:35,905 --> 00:21:38,040
If We're Lucky,
We Might Get To See A Riot.

539
00:21:38,074 --> 00:21:39,375
Movie Mason's
A Ticket Taker,

540
00:21:39,407 --> 00:21:41,043
But He's Not
Letting People

541
00:21:41,077 --> 00:21:42,278
Into Movies
He Doesn't Like.

542
00:21:42,310 --> 00:21:43,378
Did You See Pete?

543
00:21:43,412 --> 00:21:45,048
No, But Something's
Up, Though.

544
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:46,214
If They've Got
Mason Working,

545
00:21:46,248 --> 00:21:47,549
Who Knows
What's Going On?

546
00:21:47,582 --> 00:21:50,452
<I>Glimpses Of Genevieve Has Been
Nominated For More Awards

547
00:21:50,485 --> 00:21:52,888
Than All 5 Of Last
Year's Oscar Nominees.

548
00:21:52,922 --> 00:21:53,790
Jeez! We Don't Care!

549
00:21:53,822 --> 00:21:56,291
You Owe It To Yourself
To Give It A Chance.

550
00:21:56,325 --> 00:21:57,393
You Want To Give
This A Chance?

551
00:21:57,425 --> 00:21:59,261
Pete: Whoa, Whoa, Whoa!
Sir, Please!

552
00:21:59,295 --> 00:22:00,296
You Just
Settle Down.

553
00:22:00,328 --> 00:22:02,231
Well, Tell This Guy To
Cut With The Critic Act

554
00:22:02,263 --> 00:22:03,265
And Let Us
Into Our Movie!

555
00:22:03,299 --> 00:22:05,401
I'm Only Attempting
To Impart To Him

556
00:22:05,434 --> 00:22:08,237
That The Magic Of The Movies Is A Treasure

557
00:22:08,270 --> 00:22:10,239
Not To Be Taken Lightly.

558
00:22:10,271 --> 00:22:13,242
Mason? Here! Now!

559
00:22:13,274 --> 00:22:15,241
Crowd: Ooh!

560
00:22:14,276 --> 00:22:15,311
Man: Yeah! Spank Him!

561
00:22:15,344 --> 00:22:16,446
First Woman: Whoo Hoo!

562
00:22:16,479 --> 00:22:18,247
Man: Spank Him!
Bye-Bye, Now!

563
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:20,783
Second Woman:
Come On! Yeah!

564
00:22:23,284 --> 00:22:26,288
I, Sir,
Do Not Appreciate Being Spoken To

565
00:22:26,321 --> 00:22:28,290
As If I Were
A Canine.

566
00:22:28,324 --> 00:22:30,326
Well, I Just Heard
From Mr. Nedermeyer

567
00:22:30,358 --> 00:22:33,162
Who Says That You Are An Insurance
Liability Waiting To Happen,

568
00:22:33,194 --> 00:22:36,165
And He Wants You
Out Of Here Immediately.

569
00:22:36,197 --> 00:22:37,800
[Gulps]

570
00:22:38,466 --> 00:22:40,435
This Is An Outrage!

571
00:22:40,469 --> 00:22:43,172
Save It For Someone
Who Cares. Go!

572
00:22:43,204 --> 00:22:45,308
You Can't Treat Movie Mason Like This!

573
00:22:45,340 --> 00:22:46,975
He's A Legend!

574
00:22:45,340 --> 00:22:46,975
Yeah!

575
00:22:47,009 --> 00:22:49,178
Shawn: Not To Me!

576
00:22:49,211 --> 00:22:50,179
Look,

577
00:22:50,212 --> 00:22:51,280
I'm Under Enough
Pressure Tonight,

578
00:22:51,312 --> 00:22:52,447
Old-Timer,

579
00:22:52,481 --> 00:22:55,184
So Scram
Or I'll Call The Police.

580
00:23:03,158 --> 00:23:04,359
Mason: Enjoy Your Show!

581
00:23:04,393 --> 00:23:07,363
Tell My Theater That
Even When I'm Not Here,

582
00:23:07,395 --> 00:23:10,200
Its Magic Is Never Far
From My Heart.

583
00:23:14,336 --> 00:23:16,139
Someday, You'll
Have To Explain To Me

584
00:23:16,172 --> 00:23:17,306
How People Like
You And Mason

585
00:23:17,338 --> 00:23:18,640
Can Get So Worked Up
About Movies.

586
00:23:18,674 --> 00:23:21,344
Maybe It's Because We Have Fun,
Mr. Assistant Manager,

587
00:23:21,376 --> 00:23:23,212
Something You Obviously
Can't Relate To.

588
00:23:23,244 --> 00:23:25,213
Why? Because I'd Rather
Earn A Few Bucks

589
00:23:25,247 --> 00:23:26,649
Than Sit In A Dark
Theater Daydreaming?

590
00:23:26,682 --> 00:23:28,684
No.
Because You're So Locked Into Achievement Mode,

591
00:23:28,718 --> 00:23:31,387
You're Like The Oldest-Looking Teenager I Know.

592
00:23:31,420 --> 00:23:34,057
Can I Get Some
Vending Candy?

593
00:23:34,089 --> 00:23:35,224
Yeah.

594
00:23:39,694 --> 00:23:43,198
Look, You And Brian Get In To
Your Show And Behave, Ok?

595
00:23:43,232 --> 00:23:44,533
We're Way
Too Shorthanded,

596
00:23:44,567 --> 00:23:45,568
We Got
This Huge Premiere,

597
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:47,502
And Nedermeyer Calls
Every 5 Seconds

598
00:23:47,536 --> 00:23:50,206
To Say That Everything Has To Be Totally...

599
00:23:52,273 --> 00:23:54,043
Perfect.

600
00:24:01,549 --> 00:24:03,685
You Know, If You
Want To Impress Her,

601
00:24:03,719 --> 00:24:05,354
It's Probably
Better Not To Drool.

602
00:24:05,386 --> 00:24:06,355
Grow Up!

603
00:24:06,387 --> 00:24:09,224
I'm Trying To,
But Mom Won't Let Me.

604
00:24:16,264 --> 00:24:17,366
What'd You Do?

605
00:24:17,398 --> 00:24:19,234
Uh... I Didn't Do Anything!

606
00:24:19,268 --> 00:24:20,369
I Just Lifted It Up,

607
00:24:20,402 --> 00:24:22,105
And It Snapped Right Off!

608
00:24:24,639 --> 00:24:28,241
We Can't Interrupt Pete Right Now,
Or He'll Go Nuts.

609
00:24:27,276 --> 00:24:29,212
Why Can't I Just, You Know,

610
00:24:29,244 --> 00:24:30,245
Put It Down And Run?

611
00:24:30,279 --> 00:24:33,549
Hey, What's The Problem,
Little Pete?

612
00:24:33,581 --> 00:24:36,218
Uh... Uh... This Came Off,
But It's Not My Fault.

613
00:24:36,251 --> 00:24:37,252
I Was Just...
Uh, I Was Just...

614
00:24:37,286 --> 00:24:39,555
It's No Biggie, Kid.
All You Gotta Do

615
00:24:39,588 --> 00:24:43,059
Is Just
Pop It Back On...

616
00:24:43,091 --> 00:24:44,226
Uhh!

617
00:24:44,260 --> 00:24:45,228
Like This.

618
00:24:45,261 --> 00:24:46,395
Uhh!

619
00:24:46,427 --> 00:24:51,266
Aah!

620
00:24:46,427 --> 00:24:51,266
Wh-Wh-Whoa!

621
00:24:51,299 --> 00:24:53,101
Aah! Uhh!

622
00:24:53,135 --> 00:24:54,636
Aah! Uhh!

623
00:24:54,670 --> 00:24:57,240
What The Heck
Did You Do, Kid?

624
00:24:57,272 --> 00:24:59,407
He Didn't Do It,
Donny. You Did.

625
00:24:59,441 --> 00:25:01,410
Hey! I Barely
Touched It.

626
00:25:01,443 --> 00:25:03,311
Uhh!

627
00:25:03,345 --> 00:25:06,149
Phantom Of The Megaplex Strikes Again!

628
00:25:06,182 --> 00:25:07,415
Let's Go.

629
00:25:07,449 --> 00:25:10,253
Woman: What's Next?

630
00:25:10,286 --> 00:25:12,288
Excuse Me, Ladies.
Duty Calls.

631
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:15,424
Excuse Me.
Excuse Me.

632
00:25:15,456 --> 00:25:18,160
Excuse Me.
Comin' Through.

633
00:25:18,193 --> 00:25:20,163
Come On!
Let's Go!

634
00:25:32,374 --> 00:25:34,943
[Cheers And Applause]

635
00:25:34,976 --> 00:25:35,477
Whoa!

636
00:25:35,511 --> 00:25:37,280
Go!

637
00:25:35,511 --> 00:25:37,280
Go!

638
00:25:35,511 --> 00:25:37,280
Go!

639
00:25:37,312 --> 00:25:39,014
[Cheering]

640
00:25:39,048 --> 00:25:42,285
[Chanting]

641
00:25:42,318 --> 00:25:44,154
Wah!

642
00:25:48,389 --> 00:25:51,293
Oh... Wah!

643
00:25:51,327 --> 00:25:52,461
[Cheers And Applause]

644
00:25:52,493 --> 00:25:54,062
Whoo!

645
00:25:55,497 --> 00:25:57,300
Yeah!

646
00:25:57,332 --> 00:25:59,334
[Applause]

647
00:26:05,007 --> 00:26:07,010
Hey, That Was Sweet.

648
00:26:10,713 --> 00:26:11,814
Welcome To Your Doom

649
00:26:11,847 --> 00:26:14,650
Aren't You Just
Dying To Enter?

650
00:26:14,683 --> 00:26:17,520
[Giggles] I'm Gonna Go Save Us Some Seats.

651
00:26:17,552 --> 00:26:18,553
Man: Oh, Yeah!
You're Gonna Have Nightmares

652
00:26:18,587 --> 00:26:20,222
When This Is Over.

653
00:26:22,758 --> 00:26:25,361
Man, Could You Guys
Have Cut It Any Closer?

654
00:26:25,394 --> 00:26:26,828
The Movie Starts
In, Like, 15 Seconds.

655
00:26:26,861 --> 00:26:29,665
Is Erica Saving Us Seats?

656
00:26:26,861 --> 00:26:29,665
Better Hope So, Huh?

657
00:26:29,697 --> 00:26:31,333
Go In.
I'll Be Right There.

658
00:26:31,367 --> 00:26:32,501
Gotta Get
The Bri Guy Set Up.

659
00:26:32,533 --> 00:26:34,669
You Make It Sound
Like I'm A Beach Chair.

660
00:26:34,703 --> 00:26:37,206
I'll See You In 5.

661
00:26:43,045 --> 00:26:43,813
Come On!

662
00:26:43,846 --> 00:26:44,646

667
00:26:53,289 --> 00:26:54,522
Ok. You Remember,

668
00:26:54,556 --> 00:26:55,558
If Pete Comes In
To Check On Us,

669
00:26:55,590 --> 00:26:57,525
Just Say I'm In
The Ladies Room, Ok?

670
00:26:57,559 --> 00:26:58,693
If He Comes Back
A Second Time,

671
00:26:58,726 --> 00:27:01,363
Then Just, You Know,
Make Up Another Excuse.

672
00:27:01,396 --> 00:27:02,564
What If He Goes
Looking For You?

673
00:27:02,597 --> 00:27:03,699
That's My Problem.

674
00:27:03,732 --> 00:27:05,701
Look, If You Want Your 10 Bucks And A Free Movie,

675
00:27:05,733 --> 00:27:07,602
You'd Better Not
Blow This For Me, Ok?

676
00:27:07,636 --> 00:27:09,538
Ok. Happy Nightmares.

677
00:27:09,570 --> 00:27:11,540
You Sure
You're Ok With This?

678
00:27:11,572 --> 00:27:14,376
No Offense, But
I Can See You Anytime.

679
00:27:14,409 --> 00:27:16,411
I'm Here To See A Movie.

680
00:27:19,580 --> 00:27:20,949
Ok. You're Gonna Stay Here, Right,
No Matter What,

681
00:27:20,982 --> 00:27:25,387
And You're Gonna Be In This Exact
Spot When I Get Back, Right?

682
00:27:25,421 --> 00:27:26,555
Ok.

683
00:27:26,588 --> 00:27:29,224
You Better,
Or I'll Tell The Cinema Sitter.

684
00:27:29,258 --> 00:27:31,261
[Humming]

685
00:28:14,470 --> 00:28:15,371
Announcer:
The Grand Megaplex

686
00:28:15,405 --> 00:28:17,772
Invites You To Refrain
From Using Cell Phones

687
00:28:17,806 --> 00:28:18,774
And Pagers During The Movie.

688
00:28:18,807 --> 00:28:19,942
Hey, You Know
Madison Ashley Metz

689
00:28:19,974 --> 00:28:22,844
Isn't The Only Movie Star Who's Gonna Be Here Tonight.

690
00:28:22,877 --> 00:28:24,612
I Heard, You Know,
What's-His-Name

691
00:28:24,645 --> 00:28:26,682
From <I>Loflin's Dream
Is Coming, Too.

692
00:28:26,714 --> 00:28:28,483
Jacob Johnson?

693
00:28:28,517 --> 00:28:30,786
You Mean,
Jacob Johnson's Gonna Be Here?

694
00:28:30,818 --> 00:28:32,788
That's What
My Sources Tell Me.

695
00:28:32,820 --> 00:28:34,490
I Don't
Mean To Brag,

696
00:28:34,522 --> 00:28:35,957
But Since I'm The Assistant Manager,

697
00:28:35,991 --> 00:28:38,693
I Might Be Able To Introduce You To Him.

698
00:28:38,726 --> 00:28:40,028
I Don't Know
If I Could Handle It.

699
00:28:40,061 --> 00:28:45,800

00:35:44,785 --> 00:35:46,921
Let's Go Find Shawn.

877
00:35:50,658 --> 00:35:51,794
[Whimpers]

878
00:35:51,827 --> 00:35:54,897
Pete: And Now, <I>Cut To Black,
Our Most Popular Movie,

879
00:35:54,930 --> 00:35:56,098
Has The Lights
Going Berserk,

880
00:35:56,131 --> 00:35:57,899
And I Don't Know
How To Stop It.

881
00:35:57,932 --> 00:35:59,233
I Mean, All I Know
Is That The Lights

882
00:35:59,267 --> 00:36:01,102
Are Tied Into
The Same Computer Program

883
00:36:01,135 --> 00:36:02,303
As The Projection System.

884
00:36:02,336 --> 00:36:05,239
[Sighs]
Why Isn't Merle Up Here?

885
00:36:05,272 --> 00:36:07,108
Merle The Projectionist?

886
00:36:07,142 --> 00:36:10,245
But He's The Only One
Who Showed Up Here Tonight.

887
00:36:10,278 --> 00:36:12,414
How's He Supposed To Be
In All 3 Booths At Once?

888
00:36:12,446 --> 00:36:15,483
He's Probably In West 4
Getting A <I>Martian Mountain

889
00:36:15,517 --> 00:36:18,754
Uh, Well, Go Grab Him, Mark.
Tell Him It's An Emergency.

890
00:36:18,787 --> 00:36:20,790
All Right.

891
00:36:28,863 --> 00:36:31,867
[Crowd Yells]

892
00:36:33,535 --> 00:36:37,940
How Can A Whole Computer Program
Go Into Spontaneous Meltdown?

893
00:36:37,973 --> 00:36:41,109
Like I Said Before,
Sabotage!

894
00:36:41,142 --> 00:36:43,011
How'd You Get Up Here?

895
00:36:43,044 --> 00:36:45,013
I Was In Indian Guides,
Remember?

896
00:36:45,046 --> 00:36:47,950
I Slipped In
When Mark Slipped Out.

897
00:36:47,982 --> 00:36:49,283
I'm Only Trying To Help,
Ok, Pete?

898
00:36:49,316 --> 00:36:51,285
Ok, Well, Don't, Ok?

899
00:36:51,319 --> 00:36:52,988
I Have Too Much
To Deal With Already.

900
00:36:53,020 --> 00:36:55,457
Man! It's So Cool
In Here!

901
00:36:55,490 --> 00:36:59,294
Let Me Guess.
Karen Has Absolutely No Clue Where You Are.

902
00:36:59,327 --> 00:37:01,196
Who Cares?
I'm Telling You,

903
00:37:01,229 --> 00:37:02,997
You Need Me To
Help You Solve This.

904
00:37:03,031 --> 00:37:03,966
You Do!

905
00:37:03,999 --> 00:37:05,701
There's Nothing
To Solve, Brian.

906
00:37:05,734 --> 00:37:06,802
Oh, Yeah?

907
00:37:06,834 --> 00:37:09,003
How Come Nobody In This
Whole Place Can Find Shawn?

908
00:37:09,037 --> 00:37:11,506
Shawn's Still Missing?

909
00:37:11,539 --> 00:37:15,343
This Is Really Getting Weird.
Where Could He Be?

910
00:37:15,377 --> 00:37:18,347
I Heard Once
There Was This Multiplex

911
00:37:18,379 --> 00:37:21,215
In Like Oregon Or "Michigon" Or One Of Those Places,

912
00:37:21,249 --> 00:37:26,053
And Every Saturday Night For 2 Months,
A Different Guy...

913
00:37:26,086 --> 00:37:27,388
[Eerie Laugh]

914
00:37:27,421 --> 00:37:31,025
Aah! Oh!
What The Heck Was That?

915
00:37:31,059 --> 00:37:32,995
[Door Opens]

916
00:37:31,059 --> 00:37:32,995
[Gasps]

917
00:37:33,028 --> 00:37:34,897
Oh!

918
00:37:37,865 --> 00:37:39,901
[Sighs]

919
00:37:42,937 --> 00:37:44,372
Lose Somebody?

920
00:37:44,406 --> 00:37:46,508
Oh, Uh, It's
My Little Brother.

921
00:37:46,540 --> 00:37:48,243
You Mean You Still
Haven't Found Him?

922
00:37:48,276 --> 00:37:50,846
No, No. He Came Back,
But Now He's Gone Again.

923
00:37:50,879 --> 00:37:52,915
Oh!

924
00:37:52,948 --> 00:37:54,182
What's His Name?

925
00:37:54,214 --> 00:37:56,184
Brian. Brian Riley.

926
00:37:56,216 --> 00:37:58,386
If Brian Riley
Is Present,

927
00:37:58,419 --> 00:38:00,388
Please Finish
Your Business Promptly

928
00:38:00,421 --> 00:38:04,025
And Report
To Your Sister At Once!

929
00:38:04,059 --> 00:38:05,394
Now, When He Emerges,

930
00:38:05,426 --> 00:38:10,198
I Want You Two To Get Into Your Seats And Stay Put.

931
00:38:10,231 --> 00:38:13,035
[Sighs]

932
00:38:13,068 --> 00:38:14,236
[Crowd Yells]

933
00:38:14,269 --> 00:38:16,071
No Torn
Sprocket Hole

934
00:38:16,104 --> 00:38:18,372
That's Confusing
The Computer.

935
00:38:18,406 --> 00:38:21,376
No Stripped Brains.

936
00:38:21,408 --> 00:38:23,211
No Tripped Trees.

937
00:38:23,243 --> 00:38:25,079
I Don't Know.

938
00:38:29,084 --> 00:38:33,221
Yeah.
Platter's In Place.

939
00:38:33,254 --> 00:38:35,089
Ok. So I Don't Have As
Much To Do Around Here

940
00:38:35,122 --> 00:38:36,390
Since We Went
Into Full Automation.

941
00:38:36,423 --> 00:38:38,893
Somehow, The Powers That Be
Think That's Progress.

942
00:38:38,926 --> 00:38:40,095
Who Am I To Argue?

943
00:38:40,127 --> 00:38:41,296
But, Uh,
While I'm Underpaid

944
00:38:41,328 --> 00:38:42,296
And Under-Appreciated,

945
00:38:42,330 --> 00:38:44,399
I'm Still <I>Numero Uno
At Figuring Out

946
00:38:44,432 --> 00:38:46,267
How And Why Things Go Wrong.

947
00:38:46,301 --> 00:38:48,303
Ok, Master Merle,
Enlighten Me.

948
00:38:48,336 --> 00:38:50,405
Well, I Think The Problem Here,
My Friend,

949
00:38:50,437 --> 00:38:52,974
Is, Uh, Someone's
Deliberate Attempt

950
00:38:53,008 --> 00:38:54,076
To Ruin
Our Big Night.

951
00:38:54,109 --> 00:38:55,444
Thank You.
I've Only Been Trying

952
00:38:55,477 --> 00:38:57,112
To Tell Him That
For The Last Hour.

953
00:38:57,144 --> 00:38:58,446
Well, Can We
Straighten It Out?

954
00:38:58,479 --> 00:39:00,247
If I Can't,
Nobody Can,

955
00:39:00,281 --> 00:39:01,483
But It's Gonna
Take A Few Minutes.

956
00:39:01,515 --> 00:39:04,418
Ok.
Well, If You've Got Everything Under Control Here,

957
00:39:04,452 --> 00:39:07,289
I'm Gonna Head Downstairs To Prevent A Riot.

958
00:39:07,321 --> 00:39:09,857

959
00:39:13,294 --> 00:39:16,131
Pete: Please, If I
Could Just Have Your...

960
00:39:16,164 --> 00:39:17,432
I'm Really Just Trying
To Tell You,

961
00:39:17,464 --> 00:39:19,133
If You Just... Excuse Me!

962
00:39:19,167 --> 00:39:21,971
Quiet!

963
00:39:25,006 --> 00:39:26,441
Thanks.

964
00:39:26,473 --> 00:39:28,843
Told You I Was
Good To Have Around.

965
00:39:29,477 --> 00:39:32,280
Folks, I Know This Has
Been Very Frustrating,

966
00:39:32,312 --> 00:39:34,316
But Your Movie Will Be
Starting Over Momentarily.

967
00:39:34,348 --> 00:39:35,484
If You'd Rather Leave Now,

968
00:39:35,517 --> 00:39:38,120
Refunds Can Be Obtained
In The Main Lobby

969
00:39:38,153 --> 00:39:40,122
From My Senior Manager
Shawn Macgibbon.

970
00:39:40,155 --> 00:39:41,823
If Anyone Can Find Him.

971
00:39:44,325 --> 00:39:47,062
We Apologize
For Any Inconvenience.

972
00:39:49,330 --> 00:39:52,167
Good Job!

973
00:39:49,330 --> 00:39:52,167
[Crowd Talks]

974
00:39:55,569 --> 00:39:57,638
This Is Getting
Way Totally Spooky.

975
00:39:57,671 --> 00:39:59,307
Terri And I Looked
Everywhere For Shawn.

976
00:39:59,339 --> 00:40:00,341
We Absolutely
Can't Find Him.

977
00:40:00,374 --> 00:40:01,475
And Then, When We Were
Coming Out Of His Office,

978
00:40:01,508 --> 00:40:03,310
This Total Guy In Black
Shot Out Of Nowhere

979
00:40:03,343 --> 00:40:04,311
And Ran Down The Stairs.

980
00:40:04,345 --> 00:40:06,314
I Am So Not Kidding.
We Both Saw Him.

981
00:40:06,347 --> 00:40:07,482
Brian: Why Won't
You Guys Admit It?

982
00:40:07,515 --> 00:40:09,217
It's The Phantom
Of The Megaplex.

983
00:40:09,249 --> 00:40:11,385
And Nedermeyer, He Keeps
Calling For Shawn.

984
00:40:11,419 --> 00:40:13,221
Plus, You Know The Fog
Machine He Had Delivered

985
00:40:13,254 --> 00:40:14,389
So It'd Be Going Off
When The Guests Arrived

986
00:40:14,421 --> 00:40:15,389
For The Premiere?

987
00:40:15,423 --> 00:40:16,658
Now It's Disappeared,

988
00:40:16,691 --> 00:40:19,493
And Nobody's Even Gotten
The Velvet Ropes

989
00:40:19,526 --> 00:40:23,231
For The Red Carpet Out Of
The Downstairs Lobby Yet.

990
00:40:24,198 --> 00:40:26,200
Ok. Brian, I Need You.

991
00:40:26,234 --> 00:40:28,937
About Time
You Admitted It.

992
00:40:26,234 --> 00:40:28,937
Yeah.

993
00:40:31,205 --> 00:40:32,540
When I Find
That Little Brat,

994
00:40:32,573 --> 00:40:33,674
I'm Gonna Pound Him,
I Swear.

995
00:40:33,707 --> 00:40:35,676
Thanks To Him,
I've Got The Cinema Sitter

996
00:40:35,709 --> 00:40:37,678
Turning Into My Own
Personal Stalker.

997
00:40:37,711 --> 00:40:41,182
You Want To Bet The Bri Guy's
Messing With You On Purpose?

998
00:40:41,216 --> 00:40:42,184
Shh!

999
00:40:42,216 --> 00:40:43,385
Shh!

1000
00:40:43,417 --> 00:40:46,020
I'm Not The One
Who's Talking.

1001
00:40:46,053 --> 00:40:47,923
You Are Now.

1002
00:40:48,423 --> 00:40:51,193
Got To
Go Find Brian.

1003
00:40:51,225 --> 00:40:53,194
You're Missing
The Whole Movie.

1004
00:40:53,227 --> 00:40:54,261
Mother's Magic.

1005
00:40:54,294 --> 00:40:56,197
She Didn't Want Me To See This Movie,

1006
00:40:56,231 --> 00:40:58,033
Now I'm Not.

1007
00:40:58,066 --> 00:41:00,269
[Sighs]

1008
00:41:05,272 --> 00:41:08,410
Shawn? Is That You?

1009
00:41:08,443 --> 00:41:10,879
Oh, Man!
Who Did This To You?

1010
00:41:10,912 --> 00:41:11,680
[Muffled Speech]

1011
00:41:11,713 --> 00:41:13,582
Probably Be Easier
For Him To Answer

1012
00:41:13,615 --> 00:41:15,283
If You Took The Tape Off.

00:41:21,990 --> 00:41:23,225
Pete: Uhh!

1017
00:41:23,258 --> 00:41:26,227
I--Ha Ha!

1018
00:41:26,260 --> 00:41:27,428
What Happened?

1019
00:41:27,461 --> 00:41:29,396
[Groans]

1020
00:41:29,430 --> 00:41:31,098
I Don't Have A Clue.

1021
00:41:31,131 --> 00:41:32,299
I, Uh,
I Came Down Here

1022
00:41:32,332 --> 00:41:33,267
To Get These Ropes.

1023
00:41:33,301 --> 00:41:34,436
Someone Shoved Me
From Behind,

1024
00:41:34,468 --> 00:41:36,237
Held Me Down,
Tied My Hands,

1025
00:41:36,270 --> 00:41:37,272
Put Tape
Over My Mouth,

1026
00:41:37,305 --> 00:41:38,440
Before
I Saw A Thing!

1027
00:41:38,473 --> 00:41:39,574
Â™ª Da Da Da

1028
00:41:39,606 --> 00:41:44,112
Phantom Of
The Megaplex Is Back!

1029
00:41:46,680 --> 00:41:49,583
[Clears Throat] Sir?
It's Not That I Didn't Want To Answer Your Calls.

1030
00:41:49,617 --> 00:41:52,586
I Was Simply...
Tied Up. Ha Ha!

1031
00:41:52,620 --> 00:41:55,290
You And Lamonica Are Having Dinner With Who, Sir?

1032
00:41:55,323 --> 00:41:57,424
I Am Impressed!

1033
00:41:57,457 --> 00:41:58,492
How Soon?

1034
00:41:58,526 --> 00:42:00,629
No, No.
Please, Don't Rush.

1035
00:42:00,662 --> 00:42:02,798
Really. Stay.
Have A Nice, Long Dessert.

1036
00:42:02,830 --> 00:42:06,135
We'll Have Everything In Order
For You When You Arrive.

1037
00:42:08,502 --> 00:42:10,771
60 Minutes! Do You Hear Me?

1038
00:42:10,805 --> 00:42:13,441
Yes! In One Short Hour,
Nedermeyer Will Arrive

1039
00:42:13,473 --> 00:42:16,443
With That Waste Of Sweat
Lamonica And Tyler Jesseman.

1040
00:42:16,477 --> 00:42:18,480
Yes! The Director
Of

1041
00:42:16,477 --> 00:42:18,480
<I>Midnight Mayhem.

1042
00:42:18,513 --> 00:42:20,482
We Must Find Out
Who Is Causing This Chaos

1043
00:42:20,515 --> 00:42:23,151
And Make It Stop. All Right?

1044
00:42:23,184 --> 00:42:24,653
Pete, Ricky, Inside.

1045
00:42:24,685 --> 00:42:26,620
Someone Take Half-Pint
Back To His Show,

1046
00:42:26,653 --> 00:42:27,655
And Please
Check All Theaters

1047

For Any Signs Of Trouble.

1048
00:42:29,223 --> 00:42:31,158
Where Is Your Bow Tie?

1049
00:42:31,191 --> 00:42:33,327
Uh, I'll
Go Get It.

1050
00:42:33,361 --> 00:42:36,064

Gross!

1228
00:49:40,754 --> 00:49:42,222
It's Movie Mason's
Work Schedule.

1229
00:49:42,256 --> 00:49:45,059
Why Does He Have A Work
Schedule If He Doesn't Work Here?

1230
00:49:45,091 --> 00:49:47,761
Pete Says Every Week
Mason Types It All Up,

1231
00:49:47,794 --> 00:49:50,731
And Every Week Shawn
Tosses It Out.

1232
00:49:50,765 --> 00:49:53,768
Hmm. This Is
Very Interesting.

1233
00:49:55,769 --> 00:49:56,903
I'll Be Right Back.

1234
00:49:56,937 --> 00:49:59,240
We're Not Supposed To Leave This Bench, Remember?

1235
00:49:59,272 --> 00:50:01,908
Hillary, Hi.
You Remember Me, Right?

1236
00:50:01,941 --> 00:50:03,644
Brian, Pete's
Little Brother?

1237
00:50:03,678 --> 00:50:04,746
Brian, Honey!
How Are You?

1238
00:50:04,778 --> 00:50:06,079
Wow!
Look How Tall You're Getting.

1239
00:50:06,113 --> 00:50:10,084
Movie Mason... When He
Takes His Dinner Breaks,

1240
00:50:10,117 --> 00:50:11,785
Where Does He Go?

1241
00:50:12,787 --> 00:50:13,921
Why Are We Doing This?

1242
00:50:13,953 --> 00:50:15,156
We're Gonna Get
In So Much Trouble.

1243
00:50:15,189 --> 00:50:17,091
I Didn't Say You Had
To Follow Me.

1244
00:50:17,124 --> 00:50:18,259
Well, Yeah, Well, What
Was I Supposed To Do?

1245
00:50:18,292 --> 00:50:20,094
Be Sitting There All Alone
When Mom Arrives?

1246
00:50:20,127 --> 00:50:22,997
"Where's Brian?"
Gee, I Have No Idea.

1247
00:50:23,030 --> 00:50:25,098
God, How Grounded
Would I Be?

1248
00:50:25,131 --> 00:50:27,100
Not To Mention,
This Is For Employees Only.

1249
00:50:27,133 --> 00:50:28,935
I Mean, How Do You
Know About It?

1250
00:50:28,968 --> 00:50:30,270
I Came Down Here
With Pete Earlier.

1251
00:50:30,303 --> 00:50:32,807
And We're Heading Back Down Here Now Because?

1252
00:50:32,839 --> 00:50:33,841
Hillary Said Mason

1253
00:50:33,874 --> 00:50:35,977
Always Takes His Dinner Breaks In The Basement.

1254
00:50:36,010 --> 00:50:37,278
Why? What's
Down Here?

1255
00:50:37,310 --> 00:50:39,814
Probably Spiders And--
And Rats And--

1256
00:50:39,847 --> 00:50:42,649
[Slam]
[Evil Laughter]

1257
00:50:42,682 --> 00:50:45,819
Whoa!

1258
00:50:42,682 --> 00:50:45,819
The Phantom?

1259
00:50:45,852 --> 00:50:47,120
We Gotta Get
Out Of Here.

1260
00:50:47,153 --> 00:50:48,521
Are You Nuts?
We Can't Bail Now.

1261
00:50:48,555 --> 00:50:52,693
This Is Exactly Like In <I>Officer Bean,
Talented Teen Ii.

1262
00:50:52,727 --> 00:50:53,662
Look, I Don't Care.

1263
00:50:53,694 --> 00:50:55,296
Mom Is Gonna Be Waiting For Us.
Now Come On!

1264
00:50:55,328 --> 00:50:56,964
No, Just Think
How Proud She'll Be

1265
00:50:56,997 --> 00:50:59,834
When We Show Up With The Unmasked Phantom.

1266
00:51:01,669 --> 00:51:03,705
Brian. Brian!

1267
00:51:05,171 --> 00:51:08,342
I Checked Both <I>Merlin
On Mars Shows. Mason's

1268
00:51:08,376 --> 00:51:10,877
I Hate Thinking That Sweet Old
Man Could Be The Phantom.

1269
00:51:10,910 --> 00:51:13,313
Oh, Good. They're Gone.

1270
00:51:13,347 --> 00:51:16,751
Heh. At Least Something Finally
Went The Way It Was Supposed To.

1271
00:51:18,885 --> 00:51:21,154
I Do This Like I'll Actually Know Something.

1272
00:51:21,187 --> 00:51:23,023
I'm An English
Teacher!

1273
00:51:23,057 --> 00:51:25,158
But, A Car Breaks Down And A Guy Automatically

1274
00:51:25,191 --> 00:51:26,392
Looks Under
The Hood.

1275
00:51:26,426 --> 00:51:30,497
Ok, Have I Been Macho Long
Enough Now To Call The Auto Club?

1276
00:51:30,531 --> 00:51:35,336
Yes, And Then I'll Call The Theater
And Give The Kids A Heads-Up.

1277
00:51:35,368 --> 00:51:37,338
Karen: I Hate This!
We Shouldn't Be Here.

1278
00:51:37,370 --> 00:51:39,206
We Should Be Upstairs
Waiting For Mom.

1279
00:51:39,240 --> 00:51:42,176
Shh.
What If We Find The Guy Who Got Trapped In Here

1280
00:51:42,209 --> 00:51:45,680
When They Blew Up
The Original Theater?

1281
00:51:45,713 --> 00:51:47,881
What's That?

1282
00:51:52,886 --> 00:51:53,854
I Don't Like This.

1283
00:51:53,888 --> 00:51:56,190
I Don't Like This At All.
This Is Really Scary.

1284
00:51:56,223 --> 00:51:58,926
Come On, We Should
Just Go Back.

1285
00:51:58,959 --> 00:52:01,095
Come On! I Hate This.

1286
00:52:01,127 --> 00:52:03,897
Let's Get Out Of Here.
Let's Just Go! Come On!

1287
00:52:07,734 --> 00:52:09,570
Whoa!

1288
00:52:12,772 --> 00:52:14,608
Cool!

1289
00:52:18,745 --> 00:52:19,713
Look At This.

1290
00:52:19,747 --> 00:52:20,781
Wait!

1291
00:52:23,751 --> 00:52:25,919
What Are
You Doing?

1292
00:52:28,122 --> 00:52:30,957
Whoa! We're
Not Dead, Right?

1293
00:52:30,990 --> 00:52:33,126
What Are You
Talking About?

1294
00:52:33,160 --> 00:52:36,062
Long Tunnel,
Bright Light At The End.

1295
00:52:36,095 --> 00:52:37,397
I Just Wanted
To Make Sure.

1296
00:52:37,430 --> 00:52:39,232
Come On, Bri.
Let's Get Out Of Here, Please?

1297
00:52:39,265 --> 00:52:42,068
Not Till I Know
Where This Goes.

1298
00:52:42,102 --> 00:52:44,672
[Moans] Uhh...

1299
00:52:45,171 --> 00:52:47,240
Oh! This Is So Frustrating!

1300
00:52:47,274 --> 00:52:49,076
I Call The Theater,
And All I Get

1301
00:52:49,109 --> 00:52:50,912
Is This Pre-Recorded
Laundry List Of Options,

1302
00:52:50,944 --> 00:52:52,113
None Of Which Lead
To A Human Being.

1303
00:52:52,145 --> 00:52:54,247
I Call The Box Office,
And All I Get Is Show Times.

1304
00:52:54,281 --> 00:52:57,084
Wait A Sec.
Does Your Beeper Have A Callback Function?

1305
00:52:57,117 --> 00:52:58,252
I Don't Know.

1306
00:52:58,285 --> 00:53:00,421
If Pete Called From The Lobby Earlier,

1307
00:53:00,453 --> 00:53:02,256
The Number Should
Still Be In Memory.

1308
00:53:02,289 --> 00:53:04,626
Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh!

1309
00:53:02,289 --> 00:53:04,626
Here We Are.

1310
00:53:08,127 --> 00:53:11,097
[Telephone Rings]

1311
00:53:11,131 --> 00:53:12,966
City Morgue.

1312
00:53:16,035 --> 00:53:18,772
[Telephone Rings]

1313
00:53:18,805 --> 00:53:20,941
Hello?

1314
00:53:20,975 --> 00:53:23,277
On The Bench?

1315
00:53:23,310 --> 00:53:25,313
Oh, The Blue Bench.

1316
00:53:25,345 --> 00:53:27,815
Um, Hold--Hold On,
I'll Check.

1317
00:53:38,057 --> 00:53:40,126
Uh, It's--It's Empty.

1318
00:53:40,160 --> 00:53:42,864
Me? Oh, My Name.

1319
00:53:42,897 --> 00:53:44,165
I'm Mark Jefferies.

1320
00:53:44,198 --> 00:53:46,968
Oh, Hello, Mrs. Riley.

1321
00:53:47,001 --> 00:53:49,136
Um, No, I Haven't
Seen Pete.

1322
00:53:49,169 --> 00:53:53,307
You Want Me To--
To Find Out Where He Is?

1323
00:53:53,339 --> 00:53:56,843
Um, Ok, Could You--
Could You Hold On?

1324
00:53:56,877 --> 00:53:59,013
Ok, Um, Hold On.

1325
00:54:06,854 --> 00:54:07,888
Hmm!

1326
00:54:11,926 --> 00:54:13,995
Karen: Wow.

1327
00:54:14,028 --> 00:54:17,698
Brian: Ohh... Look
At All This.

1328
00:54:18,865 --> 00:54:20,834
Hmm. Yeah.

1329
00:54:20,868 --> 00:54:21,569
I Don't Get It.

1330
00:54:21,602 --> 00:54:24,171
Where'd All This Stuff
Come From?

1331
00:54:24,203 --> 00:54:27,173
Maybe Nobody
Knows About It.

1332
00:54:27,207 --> 00:54:31,011
Man, Some
Of This Old Stuff

1333
00:54:31,044 --> 00:54:33,414
Must Be Worth
A Fortune.

1334
00:54:33,446 --> 00:54:36,349
Bri, Are You Totally
100 % Positive

1335
00:54:36,383 --> 00:54:38,519
Mason Can't Possibly
Be The Phantom?

1336
00:54:38,551 --> 00:54:42,055
Of Course. Not Even
A Question.

1337
00:54:42,089 --> 00:54:47,061
Ok... Then...
What About This?

1338
00:54:49,897 --> 00:54:51,065
Whoa.

1339
00:54:57,236 --> 00:54:58,204
Hello, Children.

1340
00:54:58,238 --> 00:54:59,807
[Both Gasp]

1341
00:55:00,774 --> 00:55:01,776
Movie Mason

1342
00:55:04,111 --> 00:55:06,414
Oh Sorry I Startled You.

1343
00:55:06,446 --> 00:55:11,385
I See You've Discovered
M-Movie My Little Hideaway.

1344
00:55:11,417 --> 00:55:14,254
You--You Left
The Light On.

1345
00:55:14,287 --> 00:55:17,223
That's What Happens
With Old Age.

1346
00:55:17,256 --> 00:55:21,995
Liver Spots Come,
The Mind Goes.

1347
00:55:23,763 --> 00:55:27,734
Mason, Do You Know What's Been
Going On Around Here Tonight?

1348
00:55:27,767 --> 00:55:32,906
Crazy Projectors, Flashing Lights, Um,
Indoor Tornadoes?

1349
00:55:32,939 --> 00:55:34,407
It's Not You, Is It?

1350
00:55:34,441 --> 00:55:37,946
You're Not The Phantom
Of The Megaplex, Right?

1351
00:55:44,952 --> 00:55:47,120
Children...

1352
00:55:47,153 --> 00:55:49,289
Children...

1353
00:55:49,323 --> 00:55:51,292
Children...

1354
00:55:51,325 --> 00:55:54,662
When We Arrive In This World,
Magic Is All Around Us.

1355
00:55:54,694 --> 00:55:58,633
You Simply Have To See A Baby Discover A Butterfly

1356
00:55:58,665 --> 00:56:04,270
Or A Toddler Splash In The Bath For The First Time.

1357
00:56:04,303 --> 00:56:06,307
Yet, As The Years Pass,

1358
00:56:06,339 --> 00:56:10,144
Simple Pleasures Aren't Quite So Simple To Find.

1359
00:56:10,176 --> 00:56:13,280
Myths And Legends
Fall Away.

1360
00:56:13,312 --> 00:56:16,282
Santa's Secrets
Are Revealed,

1361
00:56:16,316 --> 00:56:19,486
Card Tricks Lose
Their Fascination.

1362
00:56:19,519 --> 00:56:22,288
True Wonder
Is Hard To Come By.

1363
00:56:22,321 --> 00:56:25,026
But There's Always...

1364
00:56:26,493 --> 00:56:29,998
Magic At The Movies.

1365
00:56:32,165 --> 00:56:36,136
Pirate Ships,
Bicycles That Fly,

1366
00:56:36,169 --> 00:56:39,506
Angels Earn Their Wings,

1367
00:56:39,539 --> 00:56:44,044
Beautiful Women
Marry Handsome Men,

1368
00:56:44,077 --> 00:56:46,479
And We All Learn...

1369
00:56:46,513 --> 00:56:51,318
There's No Place
Like Home.

1370
00:56:51,350 --> 00:56:54,488
To Destroy That Magic,
To Shatter Those Moments,

1371
00:56:54,520 --> 00:56:57,223
To Me
Is A Sin So Grave

1372
00:56:57,256 --> 00:57:01,494
As To Be Almost
Incomprehensible.

1373
00:57:01,528 --> 00:57:06,167
If There Truly Is A Phantom,
My Young Friends,

1374
00:57:06,200 --> 00:57:09,370
I Assure You...

1375
00:57:09,403 --> 00:57:15,176
It Most Definitely
Is Not Me.

1376
00:57:15,209 --> 00:57:16,243
[Both Sigh]

1377
00:57:22,615 --> 00:57:24,517
Has Anyone Seen Caitlin?
She's Supposed To Be

1378
00:57:24,551 --> 00:57:26,721
Hanging Around For The Premiere,
But I Can't Find Her.

1379
00:57:26,754 --> 00:57:30,223
I Don't Know If This Is A Sick Joke Or What,

1380
00:57:30,256 --> 00:57:31,224
But Shawn's
Gone Again.

1381
00:57:31,258 --> 00:57:32,526
And Nedermeyer
Just Called Again.

1382
00:57:32,559 --> 00:57:34,394
They Should Cancel
This Premiere.

1383
00:57:34,428 --> 00:57:35,930
Seriously! I Mean,
Once I Heard--

1384
00:57:35,963 --> 00:57:40,100
Terri! All Right, This Is The Biggest Thing
That's Ever Happened At The Grand.

1385
00:57:40,133 --> 00:57:41,234
No One's Gonna
Cancel It.

1386
00:57:41,267 --> 00:57:42,435
How're We Doing
On Clearing Out The Place?

1387
00:57:42,468 --> 00:57:44,405
You Mean Emptying
The Theaters?

1388
00:57:42,468 --> 00:57:44,405
Yeah.

1389
00:57:44,437 --> 00:57:45,705
Well, Lower Level's
Done.

1390
00:57:45,738 --> 00:57:47,607
This Level,<I>
Floodgate's Got 10 Minutes Left.

1391
00:57:47,640 --> 00:57:49,443
<I>Martian Mountain
Gets Out At 11:15.

1392
00:57:49,475 --> 00:57:50,611
Lacy's Checking
The Rest.

1393
00:57:50,644 --> 00:57:52,379
All Right, Well,
Go Check The Bathrooms.

1394
00:57:52,412 --> 00:57:53,379
All Right.

1395
00:57:53,412 --> 00:57:54,414
Woman: Oh...

1396
00:57:54,448 --> 00:57:59,252
Oh, Excuse Me,
Children.

1397
00:57:59,285 --> 00:58:00,620
Excuse Me, Will One
Of You Please Tell Me

01:05:10,684 --> 01:05:12,685
Whoa!
[Girls Scream]

1567
01:05:14,254 --> 01:05:17,891
Don't You Wish How All This Creepiness
Was Near The End, Sweetie?

1568
01:05:17,923 --> 01:05:21,861
It's Way Stressing Not Knowing Who's Doing It.

1569
01:05:21,894 --> 01:05:24,430
[Thud]

1570
01:05:27,901 --> 01:05:29,669
What The Heck
Was That?

1571
01:05:29,702 --> 01:05:31,571
It Came From
In There.

1572
01:05:37,611 --> 01:05:39,046
Hillary: Hello?

1573
01:05:39,078 --> 01:05:41,714
Is, Like, Anybody
In There?

1574
01:05:46,752 --> 01:05:48,055
It's
The Phantom.

1575
01:05:48,088 --> 01:05:50,723
What Do We Do?

1576
01:05:48,088 --> 01:05:50,723
I Don't Know!

1577
01:05:52,892 --> 01:05:55,729
Come Out Or We'll
Call The Police!

1578
01:05:55,761 --> 01:05:57,731
Both: Aah!

1579
01:05:55,761 --> 01:05:57,731
Please Don't
Call The Cops!

1580
01:05:57,763 --> 01:05:59,198
My Mom Would
So Ground Me.

1581
01:05:59,231 --> 01:06:01,067
I Didn't Even Want
To Stay! I Swear.

1582
01:06:01,100 --> 01:06:02,868
It Was All
April's Idea.

1583
01:06:02,901 --> 01:06:04,870
Relax. We Were Only Trying
To Crash The Premiere.

1584
01:06:04,903 --> 01:06:06,906
Well, You And Everybody
Else In Town.

1585
01:06:06,939 --> 01:06:08,774
But Without
A Ticket, No Go.

1586
01:06:08,807 --> 01:06:11,411
Told You, April.

1587
01:06:13,780 --> 01:06:15,716
I Came Up
To Call Nedermeyer,

1588
01:06:15,749 --> 01:06:17,117
I Was Jumped
From Behind... Again,

1589
01:06:17,149 --> 01:06:19,785
I Was Blindfolded, Handcuffed,
And Hung On The Door

1590
01:06:19,819 --> 01:06:20,987
Like A Bag
Of Dry Cleaning.

1591
01:06:21,019 --> 01:06:23,923
Well, If The Phantom's Not
Movie Mason And It's Not Merle,

1592
01:06:23,957 --> 01:06:25,392
Then We're Running
Out Of Suspects.

1593
01:06:25,424 --> 01:06:30,464
Here You All Are. Great.
Nedermeyer's Limo's On The Approach.

1594
01:06:33,832 --> 01:06:35,101
Ahem. Nedermeyer
Is To Know Nothing

1595
01:06:35,135 --> 01:06:36,102
Of Our Troubles
Here Tonight.

1596
01:06:36,135 --> 01:06:37,403
Are We Clear?

1597
01:06:36,135 --> 01:06:37,403
Yes, Sir.

1598
01:06:37,437 --> 01:06:40,773
Good. We Are Going To Act As If
Everything Is Absolutely Perfect,

1599
01:06:40,807 --> 01:06:42,908
While Praying That It
Actually Will Be.

1600
01:06:42,941 --> 01:06:44,644
Pete!

1601
01:06:46,780 --> 01:06:48,582
Uhh, Uhh!

1602
01:06:48,615 --> 01:06:49,783
This Way.

1603
01:06:49,816 --> 01:06:51,752
Ah, Mr. Nedermeyer!

1604
01:06:51,785 --> 01:06:53,819
Welcome, Welcome,
Welcome, Sir.

1605
01:06:53,852 --> 01:06:57,089
How Glorious To Have You Here This Evening,

1606
01:06:57,122 --> 01:07:00,627
Along With
Your Entourage.

1607
01:07:02,162 --> 01:07:05,633
And Mr. Tyler Jesseman.
I, Um...

1608
01:07:08,968 --> 01:07:10,103
What An Honor.

1609
01:07:10,135 --> 01:07:12,772
What A Thrill.
I--I Have Not Missed

1610
01:07:12,805 --> 01:07:14,106
A Single One
Of Your Films, Sir.

1611
01:07:14,140 --> 01:07:18,812
<I>Crow Catchers,
Dead And Gone-- Classics, Classics!

1612
01:07:20,046 --> 01:07:22,149
Hello, Lamonica.

1613
01:07:22,182 --> 01:07:24,950
Are You As Thrilled About This Evening As We Are, Sir?

1614
01:07:24,984 --> 01:07:27,788
All Preparations Proceeding Apace, Mcgreavey?

1615
01:07:27,821 --> 01:07:30,290
Macgibbon, Sir,
And Yes, They Are.

1616
01:07:30,323 --> 01:07:33,493
We Could Not Possibly
Have It More Under Control.

1617
01:07:35,662 --> 01:07:36,830
Lacy?

1618
01:07:36,863 --> 01:07:38,832
Lacy, No!

1619
01:07:40,834 --> 01:07:42,669
[Screaming]

1620
01:07:52,010 --> 01:07:54,180
At The Big Climax,
The Mayhem Monster

1621
01:07:54,214 --> 01:07:56,717
Traps A Bunch Of Kids
In The School Auditorium,

1622
01:07:56,749 --> 01:07:58,150
Then Starts
Growing So Big

1623
01:07:58,184 --> 01:08:00,653
He Completely Sucks
The Air Out Of The Place.

1624
01:08:00,687 --> 01:08:01,488
Oh, Yeah,
That Should Be

1625
01:08:01,520 --> 01:08:03,156
Real Easy For Our
Phantom To Pull Off.

1626
01:08:03,189 --> 01:08:05,192
Well, You Know He's Gonna Try Something Like It.

1627
01:08:05,225 --> 01:08:07,694
Come On.
Let's Go Warn Pete.

1628
01:08:18,104 --> 01:08:20,874
Wait Your Turn!

1629
01:08:18,104 --> 01:08:20,874
Sorry, Sir.

1630
01:08:24,077 --> 01:08:26,178
All Right,
Maccarthy...

1631
01:08:24,077 --> 01:08:26,178
Macgibbon.

1632
01:08:26,212 --> 01:08:28,013
Since You Don't
Have Any Answers

1633
01:08:28,047 --> 01:08:31,017
As To Why Our Balloons
Became Water Balloons,

1634
01:08:31,049 --> 01:08:33,052
Perhaps You Can
Answer This.

1635
01:08:33,086 --> 01:08:34,387
Who Told You To Remove

1636
01:08:34,421 --> 01:08:38,726
The Incredibly Expensive
Mayhem Monster From My Roof?

1637
01:08:41,895 --> 01:08:44,097
I Didn't
Remove It, Sir.

1638
01:08:44,129 --> 01:08:45,364
It's Up
There... Still.

1639
01:08:45,397 --> 01:08:46,365
Exactly The Way You Wanted It To Be.

1640
01:08:46,399 --> 01:08:49,202
And I'm Telling You,
That 10 Minutes Ago

1641
01:08:49,235 --> 01:08:51,204
When I Came In,
It Wasn't There!

1642
01:08:51,236 --> 01:08:53,073
Pardon Me!

1643
01:08:51,236 --> 01:08:53,073
Lamonica:
Whoa!

1644
01:08:53,105 --> 01:08:58,878
Ah, Wolfgang.
I Am Simply Stopping In To Say Good-Bye.

1645
01:08:58,912 --> 01:09:01,248
Ms. Tory Hicks!

1646
01:09:01,280 --> 01:09:03,382
The Woman Who Brought The Tinsel To Tinseltown.

1647
01:09:03,415 --> 01:09:05,217
Of Course You Know
Tyler Jesseman.

1648
01:09:03,415 --> 01:09:05,217
Yes.

1649
01:09:05,251 --> 01:09:06,919
Good-Bye? What Do
You Mean, Good-Bye?

1650
01:09:06,953 --> 01:09:08,254
Just Because I Call
My People Cattle

1651
01:09:08,288 --> 01:09:10,891
Does Not Mean They
Can Be Treated As Such.

1652
01:09:10,923 --> 01:09:12,258
We've Been Outside
Cooling Our Heels

1653
01:09:12,292 --> 01:09:14,928
In The Limos
For 3 Quarters Of An Hour.

1654
01:09:14,961 --> 01:09:16,396
Are You Opening
These Doors Or Aren't You?

1655
01:09:16,428 --> 01:09:22,101
All Right, Mcgreavey. You Heard Ms. Hicks.
Open Those Doors Now!

1656
01:09:22,135 --> 01:09:25,772
I'll See If I Can Find Out What
Happened To That Monster.

1657
01:09:31,276 --> 01:09:33,312
Â™ª Hooray For Hollywood â™ª

1658
01:09:33,346 --> 01:09:36,982
â™ª That Phony,
Super Coney, Hollywood â™ª

01:09:39,819 --> 01:09:41,120
â™ª With Their Bazookas

01:09:41,154 --> 01:09:44,089
â™ª To Get Their Name Up
In Lights â™ª

1670
01:10:14,186 --> 01:10:15,287
What Are You Doing?

1671
01:10:15,320 --> 01:10:18,457
Entertaining Your Neglected Guests.

1672
01:10:18,490 --> 01:10:21,026
Listen Here, You Freakshow,
I Could Have Sworn

1673
01:10:21,060 --> 01:10:23,830
I Told You To Keep Away
From Here This Evening.

1674
01:10:24,864 --> 01:10:26,833
Is There A Problem?

1675
01:10:26,865 --> 01:10:28,836
Stay Out
Of This, Lady.

1676
01:10:30,703 --> 01:10:31,303
Crowd: Ooh!

1677
01:10:31,337 --> 01:10:32,305
Reporter: Ms. Ashley Metz!

1678
01:10:32,337 --> 01:10:33,973
Second Reporter: Ashley,
Over Here, Ashley!

1679
01:10:34,007 --> 01:10:36,043
Crowd: Ohh!

1680
01:10:37,176 --> 01:10:42,015
I--It's--You're,
Um, You're Her.

1681
01:10:45,184 --> 01:10:46,986
Can I Introduce
My Friend To You,

1682
01:10:47,020 --> 01:10:48,221
Ms. Madison
Ashley Metz?

1683
01:10:48,253 --> 01:10:53,392
Oh... You--You Two...

1684
01:10:53,426 --> 01:10:55,328
What, You--You
Know Each Other?

1685
01:10:55,360 --> 01:10:57,062
This Is
Her Hometown.

1686
01:10:57,096 --> 01:10:59,232
She Virtually Grew Up In This Theater.

1687
01:10:59,265 --> 01:11:02,502
In Fact, Movie Mason
Was The Very First One

1688
01:11:02,534 --> 01:11:04,870
Who Encouraged Me
To Become An Actress.

1689
01:11:04,904 --> 01:11:06,172
Oh...

1690
01:11:06,204 --> 01:11:09,074
Swell. I, Uh, I--

1691
01:11:09,107 --> 01:11:11,378
If You'd Be A Sweetie
And Open The Doors,

1692
01:11:11,410 --> 01:11:14,346
My Escort And I
Are More Than Ready

1693
01:11:14,379 --> 01:11:17,751
To Go In
And Take Our Seats.

1694
01:11:23,056 --> 01:11:25,959
Reporters: Ashley! Ashley!

1695
01:11:30,396 --> 01:11:33,199
Excuse Me.
I Know That My Timing Couldn't Be Worse.

1696
01:11:33,231 --> 01:11:35,401
Um, I'm Pete Riley's Mom,
And I Don't Want To Get In

1697
01:11:35,435 --> 01:11:36,535
To See The Premiere,
I Really Don't.

1698
01:11:36,569 --> 01:11:39,138
I Just Desperately Need To Find My Kids.

1699
01:11:56,122 --> 01:11:57,390
Pete!

1700
01:11:57,422 --> 01:11:59,559
We've Been Looking
Everywhere For You.

1701
01:11:59,592 --> 01:12:01,561
Brian Found Out
The

1702
01:11:59,592 --> 01:12:01,561
<I>Midnight May Climax.

1703
01:12:01,593 --> 01:12:04,230
Well, Guess What?
Now The Giant Monster Balloon,

1704
01:12:04,262 --> 01:12:05,230
The One From The Roof?

1705
01:12:05,263 --> 01:12:07,900
It's Gone And Nobody Can
Find The Roof Level Key.

1706
01:12:07,934 --> 01:12:08,968
Wait A Minute!

1707
01:12:09,002 --> 01:12:10,837
Could This Be It?

1708
01:12:36,695 --> 01:12:39,466
Karen: Why Would Anyone Steal A
Balloon That's Bigger Than A House?

1709
01:12:39,498 --> 01:12:41,467
Where Would You
Hide It?

1710
01:12:41,501 --> 01:12:43,302
What Would You
Do With It?

1711
01:12:43,336 --> 01:12:44,303
Yeah, Well,
They Totally

1712
01:12:44,337 --> 01:12:46,006
Had To Let The Air Out Of It

1713
01:12:46,038 --> 01:12:47,172
To Get It Down
From Here.

1714
01:12:47,205 --> 01:12:48,607
You Know, Guys,
I'm Really Sorry

1715
01:12:48,641 --> 01:12:51,277
I Haven't Taken Your Opinions More Seriously Tonight.

1716
01:12:51,310 --> 01:12:53,213
Tonight?
You Never Do.

1717
01:12:56,348 --> 01:13:00,520
Ok, Well, Maybe I've Just Been So
Wrapped Up With Work And Stuff

1718
01:13:00,552 --> 01:13:03,288
That I Haven't Bothered To Notice
That You Two Are Growing Up To Be--

1719
01:13:03,321 --> 01:13:04,490
Incredibly Intelligent?

1720
01:13:04,524 --> 01:13:06,359
Amazingly
Good-Looking?

1721
01:13:06,391 --> 01:13:08,360
A Pretty Impressive Team.

1722
01:13:08,394 --> 01:13:12,132
I Hate To Say This,
But I Probably Could Learn A Few Things

1723
01:13:12,164 --> 01:13:13,499
From Hanging Out
With You Guys.

1724
01:13:13,533 --> 01:13:16,837
Well, Duh.
We're The Funnest People You Know.

1725
01:13:18,171 --> 01:13:20,874
Aw, Come Here.

1726
01:13:22,408 --> 01:13:24,177
[Evil Laughter]

1727
01:13:24,209 --> 01:13:25,345
Pete: Ohh!

1728
01:13:24,209 --> 01:13:25,345
Brian: Aah!

1729
01:13:25,378 --> 01:13:27,380
Karen: What's Going On?
Ow! What's Happening?

1730
01:13:27,413 --> 01:13:30,383
Hey, Ouch!

1731
01:13:27,413 --> 01:13:30,383
What's That?

1732
01:13:30,415 --> 01:13:32,318
Watch It!

1733
01:13:30,415 --> 01:13:32,318
Pete?

1734
01:13:32,351 --> 01:13:34,354
[Evil Laughter]

1735
01:13:34,387 --> 01:13:36,022
What's Going On?

1736
01:13:34,387 --> 01:13:36,022
Who's There?

1737
01:13:36,055 --> 01:13:39,191
What's Going On?

1738
01:13:36,055 --> 01:13:39,191
Ow!

1739
01:13:39,225 --> 01:13:45,030
What's Happening?

1740
01:13:39,225 --> 01:13:45,030
[Evil Laughter]

1741
01:13:45,064 --> 01:13:48,834
Uh, Guys What Just
Happened?

1742
01:13:48,868 --> 01:13:50,870
I'm Betting We've Been
Phatomized

1743
01:13:57,744 --> 01:14:00,680
Great. I've Seen Katey Segal,
I've Seen Levar Burton,

1744
01:14:00,712 --> 01:14:03,382
But I Haven't Spotted A Single One Of My Own Kids.

1745
01:14:03,415 --> 01:14:07,087
Oh, Wait,
There's Somebody Who Might Be Able To Help.

1746
01:14:09,387 --> 01:14:11,356
Hillary,
Hillary.

1747
01:14:11,390 --> 01:14:13,727
Hi, Julie Riley,
Pete's Mom.

1748
01:14:13,760 --> 01:14:17,196
How Are You, Mrs. R?
I Didn't Know You Were Coming Tonight.

1749
01:14:17,230 --> 01:14:18,397
Yeah, Well,
Neither Did I.

1750
01:14:18,431 --> 01:14:20,366
Listen, I'm Looking For Pete's Little Brother And Sister.

1751
01:14:20,399 --> 01:14:21,735
You Wouldn't Happen To Know Where They Might Be?

1752
01:14:21,767 --> 01:14:23,569
The Way Things Have Been
Going Around Here Tonight,

1753
01:14:23,602 --> 01:14:25,939
I Couldn't Even
Begin To Guess.

1754
01:14:27,073 --> 01:14:28,374
[Sighs]
Ok.

1755
01:14:28,406 --> 01:14:30,610
Pete: We Have To Shuffle
An Inch At A Time

1756
01:14:30,642 --> 01:14:33,546
Until One Of Us Hits That, Uh,
The Pipe With The Valve.

1757
01:14:33,579 --> 01:14:36,216
Karen: How Do We Know We
Don't Shuffle Right Off The Roof?

1758
01:14:36,248 --> 01:14:38,417
Don't Worry.
There Are Guard Rails.

1759
01:14:38,450 --> 01:14:40,720
Brian: Ok. I Get That We're
Looking For This Valve.

1760
01:14:40,753 --> 01:14:44,557
Now Explain To Me What Happens Once We Find It.

1761
01:14:44,589 --> 01:14:47,392
Look, You Think You Two
Are The Only Movie Buffs?

1762
01:14:47,426 --> 01:14:49,729
This Is Like James Raymond
In

1763
01:14:47,426 --> 01:14:49,729
<I>Huey's Cove.

1764
01:14:49,762 --> 01:14:53,566
Oh, Yeah, Exactly!
He's Trapped In The Fisherman's Net

1765
01:14:53,598 --> 01:14:56,136
But Gets Himself
To The Coral Reef.

1766
01:14:56,168 --> 01:14:58,303
And Uses It
To Open The Net.

1767
01:14:58,337 --> 01:15:01,107
Ok. We've Gotta Move Right
To Get To The Pipe.

1768
01:15:01,140 --> 01:15:02,575
Over... Over... Over.

1769
01:15:02,607 --> 01:15:04,310
Wait A Minute--

1770
01:15:02,607 --> 01:15:04,310
[Grunting]

1771
01:15:04,342 --> 01:15:06,311
Where Is It?
Where's The Valve?

1772
01:15:06,345 --> 01:15:08,580
Brian, Get Your Elbow
Out Of--Oh, Wait!

1773

I Found Them!
I Found The Valve. Ok, Guys.

1774
01:15:11,449 --> 01:15:14,287
We're Gonna Drop
Right Now. Ok...

1775
01:15:17,289 --> 01:15:19,191
All: Whoa!

1776
01:15:33,471 --> 01:15:35,440
Folks! Ahem!

1777
01:15:35,473 --> 01:15:37,276
Ladies And Gentlemen,

1778
01:15:37,310 --> 01:15:40,613
Could You Take

1779
01:15:40,646 --> 01:15:44,151
Thanks. Everybody,
Uh, Take Your Seats.

I Would Like

01:15:46,819 --> 01:15:52,357
To What I Know Will Be An
Enjoyable And Exciting Event.

1782
01:15:52,391 --> 01:15:55,461
Since We're All
Anxious To Start,

1783
01:15:55,494 --> 01:15:58,298
Let Me Introduce
The Director Of Our Film,

1784

Ooh!

Thank You Very, Very,

For Being Here.

1789
01:16:18,717 --> 01:16:23,222
I Know That Some Of You Have
Traveled A Long Way To Do So.

1790
01:16:23,256 --> 01:16:24,524
Um... The Hour Is Late,

1791
01:16:24,556 --> 01:16:27,193
So Without Further Ado,

1792
01:16:27,226 --> 01:16:31,031
Let The Mayhem Begin!

1795
01:17:09,401 --> 01:17:12,070
No!

1796
01:17:12,104 --> 01:17:13,606
Aah!

Man: Go This Way!
Let's Go This Way!

01:17:19,744 --> 01:17:23,282
Go Get The Driver!
Enough Is Enough!

Man, Is This
Getting Old!

1801
01:17:24,816 --> 01:17:27,552
Brian, Get Your Elbow
Out Of My Back!

1802
01:17:27,586 --> 01:17:28,553
It's Not Me!

1803
01:17:28,587 --> 01:17:29,622
Karen--

1804
01:17:28,587 --> 01:17:29,622
Sorry!

1805
01:17:29,654 --> 01:17:31,723
Where Is It?
Where's The Valve?

1806
01:17:31,757 --> 01:17:33,626
Looking For The--
Wait. Is That It?

1807
01:17:33,659 --> 01:17:35,395
Yes! That's It!

1808

This Way! This Way!

1809
01:17:37,430 --> 01:17:39,266
Aah!

Down A Little!
Down A Little!

1812
01:17:46,137 --> 01:17:47,339
Ok.

1813
01:17:48,774 --> 01:17:52,445
Ok, I Almost Got It.
Almost Got It. I Got It!

1814
01:17:52,477 --> 01:17:55,114
I Got It. All Right,
Come On.

1815
01:17:57,482 --> 01:17:58,784
Nice Job, Pete.

1816

Thanks.
But We've Still Got To Head Off The Phantom's Finale.

1817
01:18:04,690 --> 01:18:05,825
You're Positive
It's Him?

1818
01:18:05,857 --> 01:18:08,328
You're The Ones
With All The Clues.

1819
01:18:08,360 --> 01:18:09,595
I Just Added Them
Up.

1820

They've Already Gotten
To The Scary Parts!

1821

Man, This Movie
Must Rock!

1822

What Do We Do?
It's Blocked!

1823
01:18:15,001 --> 01:18:17,770
All Right, Let's Go.
You Want To Solve A Problem,

1824
01:18:17,802 --> 01:18:20,272
You Gotta Get Some Perspective On It.

Yeah, Hurry!

Holy Schnitzel!

1830

What Are We
Supposed To Do Now?!

1831
01:18:35,553 --> 01:18:37,457
May I Offer A Suggestion?

1832
01:18:37,489 --> 01:18:38,790
Mason! Where Did
You Come From?

1833
01:18:38,824 --> 01:18:41,794
I Left Miss Metz To Use The Rest Room,
And All Heck Broke Loose.

1834
01:18:41,827 --> 01:18:43,963
If You're Willing To Take Advice From An Old-Timer,

1835
01:18:43,995 --> 01:18:46,466
We Might Just Be Able
To Save The Day!

It Won't Come Out,
Mason.

1837
01:18:48,566 --> 01:18:50,337
Keep At It, Lad!

1838

Riley, What Are You
Doing?

1839
01:18:52,671 --> 01:18:54,039
I'm Trying To Pull
This Thing Out.

1840
01:18:54,073 --> 01:18:56,676
But You Know That Only
Happens Every 10,000 Tugs,

1841
01:18:56,708 --> 01:18:59,044
And Stupid Donny Hollie
Had It Out An Hour Ago.

1842
01:18:59,078 --> 01:19:02,548
Yeah, Well,
You Can Keep Pulling Till Your Arms Fall Off...

1843
01:19:02,580 --> 01:19:04,249
Or You Can Do This.

1844
01:19:08,521 --> 01:19:11,324
Thanks, Bro.
Mason, Let's Go.

There's One Of Them!

[Crowd Gasps]
Ohh!

1863

The Only Reason I'm Not Arresting
You For Malicious Mischief

1864
01:21:18,816 --> 01:21:20,953
Is Because I Still Have A Premiere To Get Under Way.

And I Did All This Tonight Just
So You Would Finally Notice Me!

But You Don't Care.

1878

You've Never Cared.
Ha Ha!

So Be It.
But Don't Come Crying To Me

When You Find Out
That You're Wrong!

Mr. Macgibbon!

1883
01:22:15,074 --> 01:22:17,843
You Know What I Was Saying Up On The Roof

1884
01:22:17,876 --> 01:22:19,878
About Lightening
Up A Little?

1885
01:22:19,912 --> 01:22:21,513
That's A Good Thing,
Right?

1886
01:22:21,547 --> 01:22:22,682
Yes!

Aren't I Supposed To Be Enjoying Myself?

Will You, Pete?
Please?

Of Course I Do!

01:23:11,997 --> 01:23:13,633
How 'Bout This?

1911
01:23:17,136 --> 01:23:19,939
Just Because A Plant
Is Healthy,

1912
01:23:19,971 --> 01:23:22,140
Alone In Its Pot,

1913
01:23:22,173 --> 01:23:25,444
That Doesn't Mean It's Entirely Happy.

1914
01:23:33,785 --> 01:23:35,754
Julie...

1915
01:23:35,788 --> 01:23:37,957
If You'll Have Me,

1916
01:23:37,989 --> 01:23:40,760
I Would Really Love
To Become A Part

1917
01:23:40,793 --> 01:23:42,094
Of This
Amazing Family.

1918
01:23:42,127 --> 01:23:44,797
I--Unfortunately,
I, Uh,

1919
01:23:44,829 --> 01:23:46,298
Don't Have A Ring Yet--

1920
01:23:46,332 --> 01:23:50,002
Pardon Me, Sir.
May I Offer You This Loaner?

1921
01:23:50,034 --> 01:23:53,138
Ha Ha Ha Ha!
Ha Ha Ha Ha...

1922
01:23:53,172 --> 01:23:55,808
I Have A Lot Of Props
Around

1923
01:23:55,841 --> 01:23:58,511
Just In Case
Of Emergencies.

1924
01:23:59,645 --> 01:24:00,647
Julie...

1925
01:24:01,814 --> 01:24:03,650
Will You Marry Me?

1926
01:24:10,888 --> 01:24:11,957
How Can I Resist?

1927
01:24:11,989 --> 01:24:14,526
[Crowd Cheers]

1928
01:24:23,668 --> 01:24:25,537
Ah, Mr. Riley,

1929
01:24:25,570 --> 01:24:26,971
Now...

1930
01:24:27,004 --> 01:24:29,208
With Shawn Gone And Lamonica Moving Up,

1931
01:24:29,240 --> 01:24:32,177
I'm Going To Need A New Senior Manager.

1932
01:24:32,211 --> 01:24:34,680
Money, Money.
Longer Hours.

1933
01:24:34,712 --> 01:24:35,847
What Do You Say?

1934
01:24:35,881 --> 01:24:38,584
Absolutely, Sir.
I'd Be Honored.

1935
01:24:43,855 --> 01:24:45,156
But, Uh...

1936
01:24:45,190 --> 01:24:47,827
I'm Afraid I Have
To Turn You Down.

1937
01:24:47,860 --> 01:24:49,161
Excuse Me?

1938
01:24:49,194 --> 01:24:52,231
I'm Sorry.
I Guess What I Figured Out Tonight

1939
01:24:52,263 --> 01:24:56,168
Is That I Need To Spend More Time Having A Life.

1940
01:24:56,200 --> 01:24:58,203
In Fact, Mr. Nedermeyer,

1941
01:24:58,236 --> 01:25:02,707
I'd, Uh... Really Like
The Rest Of The Night Off.

1942
01:25:02,740 --> 01:25:05,077
I Think I Deserve It.

1943
01:25:05,110 --> 01:25:08,548
Oh, You Do, Do You?

1944
01:25:09,213 --> 01:25:12,083
Good! Because
I Think So, Too.

1945
01:25:12,117 --> 01:25:13,218
[Chuckling]

1946
01:25:13,252 --> 01:25:16,756
Here.
Take Your Girl Out To A Lovely Breakfast

1947
01:25:16,788 --> 01:25:18,890
After The Picture--
On Me.

1948
01:25:18,923 --> 01:25:21,726
You Saved My Skin
Tonight, Riley.

1949
01:25:21,760 --> 01:25:23,596
I Appreciate It.

1950
01:25:24,096 --> 01:25:26,899
All Right, Everybody,
Let's Go In

1951
01:25:26,931 --> 01:25:28,734
And Enjoy The Show!

1952
01:25:31,270 --> 01:25:33,372
Oh, Lamonica!
Yes, We're Gonna Use Theater 2.

1953
01:25:33,404 --> 01:25:36,941
I Want You To Run Up
To The Projection Booth

1954
01:25:36,975 --> 01:25:39,611
And Tell Merle.

1955
01:25:36,975 --> 01:25:39,611
Ok!

1956
01:25:41,079 --> 01:25:43,382
Not That I'm...
In Over My Head Here,

1957
01:25:43,414 --> 01:25:47,619
But, Uh...
Where The Devil Is The Projection Booth?

1958
01:25:51,422 --> 01:25:54,225
Ok, Littles.
Say Good Night To Your Brother.

1959
01:25:54,258 --> 01:25:58,062
It's Time To Hit
The Road.

1960
01:25:58,096 --> 01:25:59,432
Uh, Actually, Mom,
I Was Thinking

1961
01:25:59,464 --> 01:26:02,967
It Might Be Really Nice If You Let Brian And Karen

1962
01:26:03,001 --> 01:26:04,270
Stay For The Premiere.

1963
01:26:04,302 --> 01:26:06,439
I Know It's Late,
But It's Summer.

1964
01:26:06,471 --> 01:26:10,074
Tomorrow They Can Sleep In As Long As They Need To.

1965
01:26:10,107 --> 01:26:11,409
Besides...

1966
01:26:11,443 --> 01:26:13,412
If It Wasn't For
Their Detective Work,

1967
01:26:13,445 --> 01:26:16,816
We Probably Wouldn't
Even Have A Premiere.

1968
01:26:16,848 --> 01:26:18,950
What Do You Say?

1969
01:26:18,984 --> 01:26:19,919
Please?

1970
01:26:19,952 --> 01:26:21,820
Yeah, Come On, Mom. Please?

1971
01:26:21,854 --> 01:26:23,289
Tch. Oh...

1972
01:26:23,321 --> 01:26:26,091
You're Not Afraid They're Gonna Cramp Your Style?

1973
01:26:26,123 --> 01:26:28,961
Are You Kidding?
We're Teaching Him Style!

1974
01:26:28,994 --> 01:26:30,129
Oh!

1975
01:26:30,162 --> 01:26:31,463
Sad But True.

1976
01:26:31,497 --> 01:26:35,301
Admit It, Mom.
We All Really Need To Be Together Tonight.

1977
01:26:35,333 --> 01:26:38,937
And What Better Place
For Us Than The Movies?

1978
01:26:38,971 --> 01:26:41,973
He Does Have
A Point, Hon.

1979
01:26:44,042 --> 01:26:45,778
All Right, All Right,
All Right.

1980
01:26:45,811 --> 01:26:47,112
We Can Stay?

1981
01:26:47,145 --> 01:26:49,048
Yes! Come On.

1982
01:26:47,145 --> 01:26:49,048
Yes!

1983
01:26:51,182 --> 01:26:52,818
Enjoy The Show, Sir.

1984
01:26:52,851 --> 01:26:54,153
You Enjoy The Show.

1985
01:26:54,186 --> 01:26:55,955
Enjoy The Show!

1986
01:26:55,988 --> 01:26:57,155
Ha Ha Ha!

1987
01:26:57,189 --> 01:26:58,457
Enjoy The Show.

1988
01:26:58,489 --> 01:27:01,292
You Know,
As Long As I've Been Around This Place,

1989
01:27:01,325 --> 01:27:05,330
I Never Really Believed In The
Phantom Of The Megaplex.

1990
01:27:05,364 --> 01:27:07,700
Now, The Werewolf
Of The Megaplex...

1991
01:27:07,732 --> 01:27:08,467
[Gasps]

1992
01:27:08,501 --> 01:27:11,037
That's A Different
Story Entirely!

1993
01:27:17,876 --> 01:27:20,178
[Wolf Howls]

1994
01:27:20,212 --> 01:27:22,515
[Awoo Awoo Awoo]
