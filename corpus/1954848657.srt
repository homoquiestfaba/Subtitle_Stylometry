                <i> uh...</i>

147
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:43,348
     sorry, pal,
     I think I just trampled
     on one of your vegetables.

148
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:45,083
A tomato is a fruit.

149
00:09:45,085 --> 00:09:46,851
        What'd you say?

150
00:09:48,088 --> 00:09:50,889
   A tomato is a fruit.

151
00:09:50,891 --> 00:09:55,126
So are avocados,
cucumbers, and olives.

152
00:09:55,128 --> 00:09:57,128
         -<i> All fruits. </i>
         - Huh.

153
00:09:57,130 --> 00:09:58,997
            Well...

154
00:09:58,999 --> 00:10:01,132
         that's pretty good
         information.

155
00:10:01,134 --> 00:10:02,834
     - Thanks.
     - You're pretty smart.

156
00:10:02,836 --> 00:10:06,338
     - You think I'm smart?
     - Uh... sure.

157
00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:10,909
Do you want to see
how smart that I am?

158
00:10:10,911 --> 00:10:12,344
                    ( sighs )

159
00:10:12,346 --> 00:10:14,679
              You know what?
              Maybe another day.

160
00:10:14,681 --> 00:10:17,148
             I'm just-- I'm not
             really in the mood
             for it today, man.

161
00:10:17,150 --> 00:10:19,150
      - Sorry about that.
      - Okay.

162
00:10:19,152 --> 00:10:21,252
       Have a magnificent day.

163
00:10:24,691 --> 00:10:25,924
                    ( chuckles )

164
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:28,693
                      All right.

165
00:10:28,695 --> 00:10:30,895
  Hey, Miss Amy,
  how you doing?

166
00:10:30,897 --> 00:10:33,198
     Hey, Produce. I'm great.
     How are you doing?

167
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,367
    - Produce:<i> Incredible. </i>
    - Amy:<i> Nice to see you.</i>

168
00:10:35,369 --> 00:10:36,768
            Produce:
       <i> Nice to see you.</i>

169
00:10:36,770 --> 00:10:38,403
              Amy:
    <i> Look what I'm getting.</i>

170
00:10:38,405 --> 00:10:40,772
          Mr. Campbell,
          you over there
          messing with Produce?

171
00:10:40,774 --> 00:10:42,674
          - Excuse me.
          - Oh, sorry.

172
00:10:42,676 --> 00:10:44,976
        Just having
        a conversation
        with him, Colt.

173
00:10:44,978 --> 00:10:46,778
                 I'm sure it was
                 compelling.

174
00:10:49,282 --> 00:10:51,916
              You know?
              All right, see ya.

175
00:10:51,918 --> 00:10:54,686
    But also putting
    strawberries on the top
    of waffles.

176
00:10:54,688 --> 00:10:57,022
      - Amy:<i> Look at you. </i>
      - Produce:<i> Okay.</i>

177
00:10:57,024 --> 00:10:59,791
  - What else is fresh today?
  - Tomatoes are fresh.

178
00:10:59,793 --> 00:11:01,393
( gasps )
They look good.

179
00:11:01,395 --> 00:11:03,862
              Hey, Produce,
              uh, thank you for
              that information

180
00:11:03,864 --> 00:11:06,264
          over there
          about the fruits
          and vegetables and...

181
00:11:06,266 --> 00:11:08,700
                 You're welcome.
                 My mama said

182
00:11:08,702 --> 00:11:11,102
        -<i> those are not</i>
        <i>  good for you. </i>
        - This?

183
00:11:11,104 --> 00:11:14,139
      ( chuckles )
      Well, your mama sounds
      like a smart person, too.

184
00:11:14,141 --> 00:11:16,141
           - Thanks.
           -<i> Yeah.</i>

185
00:11:16,143 --> 00:11:17,742
Could be good advice.

186
00:11:17,744 --> 00:11:20,111
            Could be good advice
            if I followed it.

187
00:11:22,849 --> 00:11:24,983
        Hey, he's a s--
         uh, you know?

188
00:11:24,985 --> 00:11:27,018
        - The hugging.
        - He's a hugger.

189
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:28,687
              What's that about?

190
00:11:28,689 --> 00:11:30,055
It's just his way
of being friendly.

191
00:11:31,725 --> 00:11:32,991
             Yeah.

192
00:11:34,728 --> 00:11:35,994
          I'm Calvin.

193
00:11:38,065 --> 00:11:39,698
     Amy.

00:11:44,004 --> 00:11:45,770
               It's nice
               to meet you, Amy.

195
00:11:45,772 --> 00:11:48,406
  Nice to meet you.

196
00:11:48,408 --> 00:11:51,843
         Would you like
         to have somebody
         to help you shop more?

197
00:11:51,845 --> 00:11:53,478
      Please help me shop.

198
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:59,017
    ¶ And I found the beauty
     that I couldn't see ¶

199
00:11:59,019 --> 00:12:01,920

200

203
00:12:17,370 --> 00:12:19,337
                     Yeah!

204
00:12:21,108 --> 00:12:23,308
     Thanks, man.

205
00:12:23,310 --> 00:12:25,143
             That was beautiful.

206
00:12:25,145 --> 00:12:26,945
<i> Thank you.</i>

207
00:12:26,947 --> 00:12:29,514
<i> It still needs</i>
<i> a lot of work,</i>
<i> but I appreciate it.</i>

208
00:12:31,051 --> 00:12:34,753
          Look... there's no one
          here, Frank.

209
00:12:34,755 --> 00:12:37,455
      I could really use
      an extra hand cleaning up
      in the back.

210
00:12:39,292 --> 00:12:41,493
Laura,
I'm not the janitor.

211
00:12:41,495 --> 00:12:43,361
                 I know, but...

212
00:12:51,438 --> 00:12:54,806
          Hey, buddy,
    it was a beautiful song.

213
00:12:56,943 --> 00:12:58,810
                It got me.

214
00:12:58,812 --> 00:13:01,045
         <i> They're lucky to have</i>
         <i> you here, Frankie.</i>

215
00:13:03,116 --> 00:13:05,316
      What's this?
      She forget her broomstick?

216
00:13:06,787 --> 00:13:09,087
        She left that
        for me.

217
00:13:12,392 --> 00:13:14,359
    Got work to do.
    I'll see you later, man.

218
00:13:32,279 --> 00:13:35,079
You didn't leave me
any coffee.

219
00:13:35,081 --> 00:13:37,048
        You know how to work
        the coffeemaker, Katie.

220
00:13:37,050 --> 00:13:39,050
 No, you drank
 it all, Dad.

221
00:13:39,052 --> 00:13:41,019
There's none in the bag.
That's what I'm saying.

222
00:13:41,021 --> 00:13:43,321
         Well, I will--
         I will run to the store

223
00:13:43,323 --> 00:13:46,191
          and get some more
          when I'm finished
          with my paper.

224
00:13:49,029 --> 00:13:50,829
     Hey, Dad?

225
00:13:50,831 --> 00:13:53,498
<i> How about</i>
<i> we go see a movie</i>
<i> or something later?</i>

226
00:13:55,602 --> 00:13:58,203
      I'd love to, Katie,

227
00:13:58,205 --> 00:14:01,606
      but I think I have to meet
      Milt and Frank later.

228
00:14:01,608 --> 00:14:03,875
                  Sorry, kiddo.

229
00:14:17,123 --> 00:14:20,491

       <i> Hi, Mr. Campbell.</i>
 <i> How you doing this afternoon?</i>

230
00:14:20,493 --> 00:14:22,927

    How are you?

231
00:14:22,929 --> 00:14:24,562
              I'm doing good.

232
00:14:24,564 --> 00:14:26,865
       Even when I'm doing bad,
       I'm doing good.

233
00:14:26,867 --> 00:14:30,301
   ( chuckles )
   Sounds pretty deep.

234
00:14:30,303 --> 00:14:32,537
   - ( clicks tongue )
   -<i> Have a magnificent day.</i>

235
00:14:38,144 --> 00:14:39,544
  You know what?

236
00:14:42,115 --> 00:14:44,082
       Um...

237
00:14:44,084 --> 00:14:47,385
  I wasn't being honest
  with you, Produce.

238
00:14:47,387 --> 00:14:49,153
    I'm not fine.

239
00:14:49,155 --> 00:14:51,522
             Well, are you sick?

240
00:14:51,524 --> 00:14:55,894
     - I don't think so.
     - Maybe you just need
       to smile.

241
00:14:55,896 --> 00:14:58,296
            "A cheerful heart
            is good medicine."

242
00:15:00,267 --> 00:15:01,966
    Where'd you get that?
    A bumper sticker?

243
00:15:03,303 --> 00:15:05,169
             <i> You told me</i>
             <i> that I was smart.</i>

244
00:15:05,171 --> 00:15:07,238
          - Remember?
          - Yeah.

245
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:09,240
            You wanna see
            how smart I am?

246
00:15:09,242 --> 00:15:11,242
           Uh...
           ( coughs )

247
00:15:11,244 --> 00:15:12,577
         Well, I'll tell
         you what.

248
00:15:12,579 --> 00:15:14,445
       Maybe not today,
       because I gotta...

249
00:15:14,447 --> 00:15:16,180
       ( clicks tongue )
       I gotta...

250
00:15:16,182 --> 00:15:18,216
     - Pick up that melon.
     - All right.

251
00:15:18,218 --> 00:15:21,286
         They label all of these
         fruits and vegetables

252
00:15:21,288 --> 00:15:24,022
               with some numbers
               on them.

253
00:15:24,024 --> 00:15:27,325
          But I know
          the number on the top
          of that melon.

254
00:15:27,327 --> 00:15:30,194
          - Okay, go.
          - 4329.

255
00:15:30,196 --> 00:15:32,597
  Yeah, 4329.

256
00:15:32,599 --> 00:15:34,465
That's correct.

257
00:15:34,467 --> 00:15:37,135
That's impressive, Produce.
Good job.

258
00:15:37,137 --> 00:15:40,104
                Pear. Anjou.

259
00:15:40,106 --> 00:15:42,373
                    4422.

260
00:15:42,375 --> 00:15:44,943
 Yep. Correct.

261
00:15:44,945 --> 00:15:47,445
            Banana.
            That's the easy one.

262
00:15:47,447 --> 00:15:49,681
        Everybody likes bananas.

263
00:15:49,683 --> 00:15:51,115
                       4011.

00:15:53,053 --> 00:15:56,187
       <i> Gala apple. 4135.</i>

268
00:16:04,597 --> 00:16:06,698
       Yeah.
       There we go.

269
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:08,333
    ( clears throat )
    I'm really impressed.

270
00:16:08,335 --> 00:16:09,968
I mean, you're kinda like
"Rain Man" or something.

271
00:16:09,970 --> 00:16:11,369
        Like Superman or Batman!

272
00:16:11,371 --> 00:16:12,971
  Oh!

273
00:16:12,973 --> 00:16:15,373
             Ow.

274
00:16:15,375 --> 00:16:17,475
           You're proud of me
           'cause I'm smart.

275
00:16:19,346 --> 00:16:21,212
   - I'm sorry, Mr. Campbell.
   - No, that's all right.

276
00:16:21,214 --> 00:16:22,747
    He didn't realize
    he was bugging you.

277
00:16:24,451 --> 00:16:26,484
  What did I tell you
  about hugging the customers?

278
00:16:26,486 --> 00:16:29,654
     Now you get back
     to work, young man.

279
00:16:29,656 --> 00:16:31,356
      You have a nice day,
      Mr. Campbell.

280
00:16:31,358 --> 00:16:32,690
   - You, too, Dexter.
   - I'm sorry about the hug.

281
00:16:32,692 --> 00:16:34,459
Nah, like I said.

282
00:16:36,229 --> 00:16:38,629
Hey, Produce.

283
00:16:38,631 --> 00:16:40,264
I'm impressed.

284
00:16:48,241 --> 00:16:50,074
          - Frank?
          -<i> Hi, Susan.</i>

285
00:16:50,076 --> 00:16:51,609
        Is Milt here?

286
00:16:51,611 --> 00:16:53,544
             Is everything okay?

287
00:16:53,546 --> 00:16:55,279
          ( sighs )
          Yeah, yeah,
          it's good.

288
00:16:55,281 --> 00:16:56,547
        I just need
        to talk to him.

289
00:16:56,549 --> 00:16:58,249
  Yeah, come in.

290
00:17:00,754 --> 00:17:02,754
    - You doing all right?
    - Yeah, nice to see you.

291
00:17:02,756 --> 00:17:04,489
          - You, too.
          - Milt.

292
00:17:06,459 --> 00:17:08,359
    - Hey, buddy, what's up?
    -<i> What's up, man?</i>

293
00:17:08,361 --> 00:17:09,727
     - What's up?
     - You doing all right?

294
00:17:09,729 --> 00:17:11,496
               Yeah.
               What's going on?

295
00:17:12,532 --> 00:17:14,132
   Okay, um...

296
00:17:14,134 --> 00:17:16,267
there's no easy way
to ask you this, so...

297
00:17:16,269 --> 00:17:19,437
 - Okay.
 - I need to borrow
   some money for a hotel room.

298
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:21,406
It's not long.
I'll pay you back.

299
00:17:21,408 --> 00:17:24,275
        - What happened?
        - I got evicted.

300
00:17:24,277 --> 00:17:26,310
   - Hadn't paid in a while,
    so kinda had it comin'.
   - ( exhales sharply )

301
00:17:26,312 --> 00:17:28,312
        Well, you're not getting
        in any hotel, all right?

302
00:17:28,314 --> 00:17:30,081
       You stay here, all right?
       We got plenty of room.

303
00:17:30,083 --> 00:17:31,549
     - You're like family.
     - Man, I--

304
00:17:31,551 --> 00:17:33,785
      No, no, no, no. Stay here.
      We got plenty of room.

305
00:17:41,528 --> 00:17:44,228
   ( clears throat )
   So I got some towels
   if you want to take a shower

306
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:46,297
     and help yourself
     to anything in the kitchen.

307
00:17:47,767 --> 00:17:49,834
     Thank you.

308
00:17:49,836 --> 00:17:51,536
                 You're welcome.

               that jacket off,
               get back in bed.

316
00:18:44,757 --> 00:18:48,593
    You know how many girls
    wanna get with me right now?

317
00:18:48,595 --> 00:18:51,329
               But here I am.
               I'm trying to be
               faithful to you.

318

321
00:19:02,509 --> 00:19:04,142
      - Yeah.
      - But you said
        that you've been--

322
00:19:04,144 --> 00:19:06,878
    I know.
    I-- I lied.

323
00:19:08,381 --> 00:19:11,482
I just wanted you
to like me, so I said it.

           you know that?

326
00:19:22,195 --> 00:19:24,662
        Listen, I got some wine
        out in my Jeep, okay?

327
00:19:24,664 --> 00:19:27,398
         It's in a box,
         so we don't need
         an opener or anything.

328
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:29,500
    - That's special, right?
    - You don't get it.

329
00:19:29,502 --> 00:19:31,502
     No, you don't get it,
             Katie.

           a guy like this.

                 fruit number

     to swing this broomstick

         Hey, where do you think
         you're going, huh?

549
00:30:58,524 --> 00:31:00,557
             Katie:
   <i> What are you doing, Colt?</i>

550
00:31:00,559 --> 00:31:03,393
       Stay out of this, Katie.
       It's got nothing to do
       with you.

551
00:31:03,395 --> 00:31:06,196
        Listen, man, I told you
        to keep your mouth shut.

552
00:31:06,198 --> 00:31:08,065
               I got fired today
               'cause of you.

553
00:31:08,067 --> 00:31:11,034
    - You did something bad.
    - What?

554
00:31:11,036 --> 00:31:13,070
           What exactly
           did I do to you?

555
00:31:13,072 --> 00:31:14,571
                   Huh? Nothing!

556
00:31:14,573 --> 00:31:16,640
                I did absolutely
                nothing to you.

557
00:31:16,642 --> 00:31:20,010
I came to give
Mr. Campbell a melon.

558
00:31:20,012 --> 00:31:21,945
                 ( scoffs )

559
00:31:21,947 --> 00:31:24,014
                This melon?

560
00:31:24,016 --> 00:31:25,949
        You came to give
        Mr. Campbell this melon?

561
00:31:25,951 --> 00:31:28,485
 Produce:
<i> Yes. Don't break</i>
<i> Mr. Campbell's melon!</i>

562
00:31:28,487 --> 00:31:30,654
         Katie:<i> Colt!</i>
        <i> Leave him alone, Colt!</i>

563
00:31:30,656 --> 00:31:32,422
      Can't you see
      he's different?!

564
00:31:39,298 --> 00:31:41,365
        All right, man,
        you know what?

565
00:31:41,367 --> 00:31:43,100
        Take your melon.

566
00:31:45,204 --> 00:31:47,304
          Come on, guys,
          let's get out of here.

567
00:31:52,011 --> 00:31:53,977
           ( car engine starts )

568
00:32:24,343 --> 00:32:25,609
     Produce.

569
00:32:25,611 --> 00:32:27,311
      <i> ( car door closes )</i>

570
00:32:27,313 --> 00:32:29,446
                   <i> What are you</i>
                   <i> doing here?</i>

571
00:32:31,383 --> 00:32:33,150
Where's Katie?

572
00:32:33,152 --> 00:32:34,484
        She left.

573
00:32:36,989 --> 00:32:38,522
          I brought you a melon.

574
00:32:40,259 --> 00:32:42,159
       I see that.

575
00:32:42,161 --> 00:32:44,661
       Um... that was
       nice of you.

576
00:32:44,663 --> 00:32:46,363
       Does your mama know
       where you are?

577
00:32:47,599 --> 00:32:49,099
               You don't like
               my melon?

578
00:32:49,101 --> 00:32:51,301
            Aw...

579
00:32:51,303 --> 00:32:54,004
    ( sighs )
    That's not it
    at all, Produce.

580
00:32:54,006 --> 00:32:56,974
   - Thank you for the melon.
   - You're welcome.

581
00:32:58,177 --> 00:33:01,545
              So... why are you
              all dirty?

582
00:33:01,547 --> 00:33:03,113
                Did you fall
                off your bike?

583
00:33:03,115 --> 00:33:05,148
        - Yes.
        - Are you hurt?

584
00:33:05,150 --> 00:33:07,384
          - No.
          - You okay?

585
00:33:07,386 --> 00:33:09,186
            - Yeah.
            - Okay.

586
00:33:13,258 --> 00:33:14,624
                   Well...

587
00:33:16,528 --> 00:33:19,062
                   um...

588
00:33:19,064 --> 00:33:21,031
                do you want
                a ride home?

589
00:33:23,002 --> 00:33:27,070
      - You smell funny.
      - Yeah, it's, uh...

590
00:33:27,606 --> 00:33:30,374
         that's what the French
         call<i> eau de Bourbon.</i>

591
00:33:30,376 --> 00:33:32,075
                    ( laughs )

592
00:33:34,580 --> 00:33:36,446
                    Not funny?

593
00:33:38,584 --> 00:33:41,651
                  ( chuckles )
                  Okay.

594
00:33:41,653 --> 00:33:45,489
               Well, I'm gonna
               go, uh, to sleep

595
00:33:45,491 --> 00:33:47,157
               'cause it's
               real, real late

596
00:33:47,159 --> 00:33:52,062
          and, um, I'll see ya
          tomorrow or whenever.

597
00:33:57,636 --> 00:34:00,337
        - Good-bye.
        - Hey, Produce?

598
00:34:01,774 --> 00:34:04,541
                   Hey.

599
00:34:04,543 --> 00:34:06,676
                 Thank you
                 for my melon.

600
00:34:06,678 --> 00:34:08,445
You're welcome.

601
00:34:23,295 --> 00:34:25,629
              And away he goes.

602
00:34:25,631 --> 00:34:28,131
           Oh, he-- Produ--
           ( clears throat )

603
00:34:28,133 --> 00:34:30,634
            Produce, you forgot
            your--

604
00:34:30,636 --> 00:34:32,202
                     hey--

605
00:34:34,306 --> 00:34:37,307
      <i> ( birds chirping )</i>

606
00:34:37,309 --> 00:34:39,476
   <i> ( footsteps approaching )</i>

607
00:34:41,380 --> 00:34:43,413
        Hey, Katie bear?

608
00:34:43,415 --> 00:34:45,248
   Which, uh--
   which tie do you
   think I should wear?

609
00:34:45,250 --> 00:34:46,583
     This one
     or this one?

610
00:34:46,585 --> 00:34:48,151
    - ( chuckles ) Neither.
    - No?

611
00:34:48,153 --> 00:34:49,853
             No, you're not much
             of a tie guy.

612
00:34:49,855 --> 00:34:52,322
   Yeah, I guess
   you're right.

613
00:34:52,324 --> 00:34:53,824
                  Why are you
                  so dressed up?

614
00:34:53,826 --> 00:34:57,094
             Ah, I got that
             meeting tonight.

615
00:34:57,096 --> 00:34:59,596
        ( sighs )
        The owners of the Bats,
        you remember?

616
00:34:59,598 --> 00:35:01,398
        - Oh, yeah,
          that's right.
        - Yeah.

617
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:04,468
     - That's awesome, Dad.
     - Thanks.

618
00:35:04,470 --> 00:35:07,137
So just call me after
and we can grab dinner
to celebrate.

619
00:35:08,173 --> 00:35:09,806
            Yeah, okay.

620
00:35:09,808 --> 00:35:11,842
        - I'd like that.
        -<i> Me, too.</i>

621
00:35:11,844 --> 00:35:13,777
    - Well, all right, then,
     it's a date.
    -<i> Okay.</i>

622
00:35:13,779 --> 00:35:16,113
                All right.

623
00:35:16,115 --> 00:35:19,449
     <i> ( Produce, muffled )</i>
         <i> Mr. Campbell!</i>

624
00:35:24,156 --> 00:35:25,789
     You should tell your
     mentally challenged friend

625
00:35:25,791 --> 00:35:27,757
           not to come
           around here anymore.

626
00:35:27,759 --> 00:35:29,893
    Produce?
    Why?

627
00:35:29,895 --> 00:35:32,829
     - Colt says
      he's a troublemaker.
     - ( laughs )

628
00:35:32,831 --> 00:35:34,598
He's not a troublemaker.

629
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:36,666
Colt on the other hand...

630
00:35:36,668 --> 00:35:39,302
    -<i> ( knock on door ) </i>
    - Can you open the door
     for him, please?

631
00:35:39,304 --> 00:35:41,771
            Dad, Colt is gonna
            be here any minute.

632
00:35:41,773 --> 00:35:43,373
Yeah, I don't care
about Colt.

633
00:35:43,375 --> 00:35:45,442
          Okay, well,
          just make it quick.

634
00:35:47,713 --> 00:35:49,379
             - Hi.
             - Hey.

635
00:35:49,381 --> 00:35:51,214
       - Is that for me?
       - Yes, it is.

636
00:35:51,216 --> 00:35:53,150
                     Oh.

637
00:35:53,152 --> 00:35:54,417
       - Thanks.
       - You're welcome.

638
00:35:54,419 --> 00:35:57,220
    I got them from
    the flowers department

639
00:35:57,222 --> 00:35:59,556
      and they've got
      plants there, too.

640
00:35:59,558 --> 00:36:01,558
              Oh, I'm gonna go
              put them in water.

641
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:03,160
            - Okay.
            - Okay.

642
00:36:03,162 --> 00:36:05,929
               Yeah, he's a real
               troublemaker.

643
00:36:05,931 --> 00:36:08,765
      - Hey, big guy.
      - Hey, Mr. Campbell.

644
00:36:08,767 --> 00:36:10,800
        - How you doing?
        - Incredible.

645
00:36:10,802 --> 00:36:13,537
       - That's good.
       - I left my book
        here last night.

646
00:36:13,539 --> 00:36:15,338
    -<i> And I really need it. </i>
    - Yes, you did.

647
00:36:15,340 --> 00:36:18,408
             It's exactly
             where you left it.

648
00:36:18,410 --> 00:36:19,876
    - Here you go, big guy.
    - Thank you.

649
00:36:19,878 --> 00:36:21,945
            Hey, you look sharp.
            Where you going?

650
00:36:21,947 --> 00:36:23,713
  Thanks.
  I'm going to church.

651
00:36:23,715 --> 00:36:26,583
 It practically starts
 in 17 minutes.

652
00:36:26,585 --> 00:36:29,786
      - Practically, huh?
      -<i> Look at my watch.</i>

653
00:36:29,788 --> 00:36:31,388
    My mama told me

654
00:36:31,390 --> 00:36:34,624
it has all the whistles
and all the bells.

655
00:36:34,626 --> 00:36:38,962
          Yeah, well, I think
          your mama's right.
          It looks like it does.

656
00:36:38,964 --> 00:36:40,830
     - It's a beautiful
       timepiece, Produce.
     -<i> Thank you.</i>

657
00:36:42,334 --> 00:36:44,834
Uh, do you want to come
to church with me?

658
00:36:46,939 --> 00:36:48,705
                    No.

659
00:36:48,707 --> 00:36:51,675
        <i> ( car pulls up,</i>
         <i> horn honks )</i>

660
00:36:56,348 --> 00:36:58,381
It's been a long time
since someone got
me flowers.

661
00:36:58,383 --> 00:37:00,817
       - So, thank you.
       - You're welcome.

662
00:37:03,455 --> 00:37:06,356
             Hey, Produce,
             let me ask you
             a question.

663
00:37:06,358 --> 00:37:07,824
            What do you think
            of that boy?

664
00:37:09,595 --> 00:37:11,394
            Produce:
         <i> Well, I think</i>
         <i> he's arrogant</i>

665
00:37:11,396 --> 00:37:15,565
and I would love
to give him a karate chop.

666
00:37:15,567 --> 00:37:18,368
              ( laughs )
              Me, too, boy.
              Me, too.

667
00:37:18,370 --> 00:37:21,404
             All right,
             have a good Sunday.

668
00:37:22,608 --> 00:37:24,674
Uh, well, I don't
want to be late.

669
00:37:24,676 --> 00:37:28,378
  If I ride my bike,
  I'll be late.

670
00:37:28,380 --> 00:37:30,647
  Can you please
  give me a ride?

671
00:37:30,649 --> 00:37:34,284
  - Please?
  - But I've got to go
   play golf with my friend.

672
00:37:34,286 --> 00:37:36,286
       And then afterwards
       I got a real big meeting.

673
00:37:36,288 --> 00:37:37,621
    - So...
    - I know-- I know that.

674
00:37:37,623 --> 00:37:41,591
I do understand that,
but I need a ride, please.

675
00:37:42,694 --> 00:37:44,427
   Give me a ride,
   please.

676
00:37:44,429 --> 00:37:46,296
                    ( sighs )

677
00:37:46,298 --> 00:37:48,665
          All right, what time--
          how-- how--

678
00:37:48,667 --> 00:37:50,634
              all right, just...

679
00:37:55,774 --> 00:37:58,942
Calvin:
Now I'm gonna drop you off,
but I'm not going inside.

680
00:37:58,944 --> 00:38:02,345
Your daughter
is extremely sweet.

681
00:38:03,415 --> 00:38:04,581
                      Yes.

682
00:38:06,285 --> 00:38:08,685
     I just wish she came
     with an instruction manual.

683
00:38:08,687 --> 00:38:12,022
Produce:
Why would she come
with an instruction manual?

684
00:38:12,024 --> 00:38:13,823

                     Oh, crap.

687
00:38:19,564 --> 00:38:21,398
      - Ah, man.
      - What's the matter,
       Mr. Campbell?

688
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:23,933
                   Uh, nothing.

689
00:38:23,935 --> 00:38:26,436
I had some drinks
this morning.
Damn it!

690
00:38:30,909 --> 00:38:33,310
                  ( sighs )

691

692
00:38:36,615 --> 00:38:37,947
    Hey, Mr. Officer.

693
00:38:39,551 --> 00:38:41,951
  - Hi, Calvin.
  - Hey, Mitch, how you doing?

694
00:38:41,953 --> 00:38:44,821
                    Good, good.
                    What's, uh--

695
00:38:44,823 --> 00:38:46,389
              Wha-- what's going
              on here?

696
00:38:46,391 --> 00:38:47,924
Uh, well...
( clears throat )

697
00:38:47,926 --> 00:38:49,826
I'm just, uh--

698
00:38:49,828 --> 00:38:51,594
I'm just teaching
the boy how to drive.

699
00:38:51,596 --> 00:38:52,796
          - Uh-huh.
          - You know?

700
00:38:52,798 --> 00:38:54,097
And he's doing
pretty great.

701
00:38:54,099 --> 00:38:55,799
He's just-- he's going
a little fast.

702
00:38:55,801 --> 00:38:57,801
( whispers )
He doesn't know
any better.

703
00:38:57,803 --> 00:38:59,769
                    Yeah, right,
                    I-- right.

704
00:38:59,771 --> 00:39:01,705

705
00:39:01,707 --> 00:39:03,740
                     Well, uh...
                     ( sighs )

706
00:39:03,742 --> 00:39:06,009
Encouragement helps.

707
00:39:08,447 --> 00:39:11,648
         All right, uh,
         you're-- you're doing
         a great job here, son.

708
00:39:11,650 --> 00:39:13,850
       - Thank you.
       - You're welcome.

709
00:39:13,852 --> 00:39:15,785
     Just slow it down.
     Speed kills, remember that.

710
00:39:15,787 --> 00:39:18,488
   Okay. Speed kills.
   I'll remember that.

711
00:39:18,490 --> 00:39:20,657
             Speed kills.

712
00:39:20,659 --> 00:39:23,126
          ( clears throat )
          All right.

713
00:39:23,128 --> 00:39:24,728
  - You boys have a nice day.
  - Calvin:<i> All right.</i>

714
00:39:24,730 --> 00:39:26,129
       - Produce: Thanks.
       - Be careful.

715
00:39:26,131 --> 00:39:28,631
Thank you, Officer.

716
00:39:28,633 --> 00:39:31,101
  ( both sigh )

717
00:39:31,103 --> 00:39:33,536
 Calvin:
<i> Good job.</i>

718
00:39:33,538 --> 00:39:35,572
<i> Good, good.</i>

719
00:39:35,574 --> 00:39:38,141
  - I think you better drive.
  - ( sighs )

720
00:39:38,143 --> 00:39:39,809
  Well...

721
00:39:42,581 --> 00:39:44,381
you're about
to drive a car.

722
00:39:44,383 --> 00:39:46,716
       <i> ( music playing )</i>

723
00:39:46,718 --> 00:39:47,951
      Go.

724
00:39:50,155 --> 00:39:51,955
Calvin:
Real slow.

725
00:39:51,957 --> 00:39:54,557
Keep your eyes
on the road.

726
00:39:54,559 --> 00:39:57,727
               I've never driven
               a car before.

727
00:39:57,729 --> 00:40:01,664
   - I only have a bicycle.
   - Well, you're doing good.

728
00:40:01,666 --> 00:40:03,767
      This is incredible!

729
00:40:06,538 --> 00:40:09,739
     Hey, uh...

730
00:40:09,741 --> 00:40:11,775
   so I'm gonna be
   a little late.

731
00:40:11,777 --> 00:40:12,809
Yeah, something came up.

732
00:40:12,811 --> 00:40:14,677
I gotta take
somebody to church

733
00:40:14,679 --> 00:40:17,814
   and it's taking
   a little longer
   than I thought.

734
00:40:17,816 --> 00:40:19,983
 Yeah, I'll see ya.

735
00:40:19,985 --> 00:40:21,751
    - ( horn honks )
    - All right, all right.

740
00:40:32,898 --> 00:40:35,098
          Nice!

741
00:40:35,100 --> 00:40:37,801
    ( grunts )
    All right, all the way.
    I got him.

742
00:40:37,803 --> 00:40:40,170

744
00:40:49,047 --> 00:40:51,214
Uh... next time.

745
00:40:53,652 --> 00:40:55,919
       - Promise?
       - I can't promise.

     Mr. Campbell.

748
00:41:02,761 --> 00:41:03,860
                     Huh.

749
00:41:05,464 --> 00:41:07,464
Well, good luck at your
baseball meeting tonight.

750
00:41:07,466 --> 00:41:09,232
       - Thanks, bud.
       - You're welcome.

751
00:41:10,802 --> 00:41:12,769
     - Have fun at church.
     - Thanks.

752
00:41:21,980 --> 00:41:23,246
<i> Huh.</i>

753
00:41:26,251 --> 00:41:27,684

             Milt:
   <i> All right, so who is she?</i>

755
00:41:33,091 --> 00:41:34,891
        Who?

756
00:41:34,893 --> 00:41:37,160
    This friend you've been
    spending all this time with.

757
00:41:38,563 --> 00:41:40,263
             The market, church.

758
00:41:40,265 --> 00:41:41,965
               Who is she
               and can I please
               see a picture?

759
00:41:41,967 --> 00:41:43,566
Oh, it's not a lady.

760
00:41:43,568 --> 00:41:46,536
I've been hanging out
with that kid, Produce.

761
00:41:46,538 --> 00:41:49,172
      - The retarded kid?
      - Hey, easy.

762
00:41:49,174 --> 00:41:52,008
It's called
Down Syndrome.

763
00:41:52,010 --> 00:41:55,879
I'll tell you something,
you spend a second
with this kid

764
00:41:55,881 --> 00:41:58,248
  and you realize
  he's just like
  you and me.

765
00:41:58,250 --> 00:42:00,049
                Milt:
                You're a genius.

766
00:42:00,051 --> 00:42:02,519
     What's guaranteed
     to make people spend money?

767
00:42:02,521 --> 00:42:05,121
     The mentally handicapped--
     challenged, whatever
     you call it.

768
00:42:05,123 --> 00:42:07,090
          That's what I need
          for my new dealership
          commercial.

769
00:42:07,092 --> 00:42:09,158
    Calvin:
    Like you're
    gonna give money

770
00:42:09,160 --> 00:42:11,628
    to the Special Olympics
    or something every time
    you sell a car?

771
00:42:11,630 --> 00:42:13,129
 - What are you talking about?
 - No, you tool bag.

772
00:42:13,131 --> 00:42:15,131
            I want him to star
            in my commercial.
            It's perfect.

773
00:42:15,133 --> 00:42:17,200
Come on, Milt.

774
00:42:17,202 --> 00:42:19,769
     Okay, maybe not him,
     maybe one of his special
     buddies will do it.

775
00:42:19,771 --> 00:42:23,072
  - Hey, conversation's over.
  - Cal.

776
00:42:23,074 --> 00:42:25,575
Come on, man,
sales are down.

777
00:42:25,577 --> 00:42:28,211
Do your old buddy Milt
a solid and call the kid.

778
00:42:29,548 --> 00:42:31,114
He won't know
the difference.

779
00:42:31,116 --> 00:42:32,982
Maybe he'll do it for free.
You know, he's retarded.

780
00:42:32,984 --> 00:42:34,684
                   Hey!

781
00:42:34,686 --> 00:42:36,252
            I said
            it's Down Syndrome.

782
00:42:36,254 --> 00:42:38,621
( laughs )
Okay, what are you--

783
00:42:38,623 --> 00:42:40,023
you feeling sorry
for him?

784
00:42:40,025 --> 00:42:44,727
          No, Milt,
          I feel sorry for you.

785
00:42:44,729 --> 00:42:46,863
   B.S., man,
   you feel sorry
   for yourself.

786
00:42:49,034 --> 00:42:51,801
You've been feeling sorry
for yourself since Detroit
kicked you off the team.

787
00:42:55,106 --> 00:42:57,840
  - What'd you just say to me?
  - You heard every word
   I said.

788
00:42:57,842 --> 00:43:01,010
I'm not gonna sit here
and debate some loser

789
00:43:01,012 --> 00:43:04,080
who can't get over the fact
that he was an embarrassment
in the majors.

What, are you
gonna freeze?

791
00:43:09,354 --> 00:43:12,722
Is your whole life
just gonna freeze?

792

at home plate?

Hi, uh...

973

My name
is Calvin Campbell.

974

     And, uh...

975
00:57:31,081 --> 00:57:32,948
      I live here,

              I have a daughter.

979
00:57:43,194 --> 00:57:45,194
                 She's 17.

              I love her more
              than anything.

first name only is fine.

989

That's kind of
the anonymous part.

that you're an alcoholic.

  That part is...

993
00:58:22,099 --> 00:58:23,632

         Cal, the things
         I said to you, man,
         everything I said--

1103
01:08:00,644 --> 01:08:04,145
     Hey, what you said
     was true and I needed
     to hear it.

1104
01:08:10,287 --> 01:08:11,686
             ( Calvin growls )

1105
01:08:11,688 --> 01:08:13,088
   - Milt: Missed you, buddy.
   - I'm sorry.

1106
01:08:13,090 --> 01:08:14,556
          - I'm sorry.
          - I'm sorry.

1107
01:08:14,558 --> 01:08:16,224
     - You should be sorry.
     - It was a cheap shot.

1108
01:08:16,226 --> 01:08:18,393
                ( laughs )

1109
01:08:18,395 --> 01:08:20,228
Let's get out of here.
Let's get a beer.

1110
01:08:22,099 --> 01:08:23,865
            How about we make it
            a coffee?

1111
01:08:23,867 --> 01:08:26,868
          - A coffee?
          - AA.

1112
01:08:29,606 --> 01:08:31,372
You're not
an alcoholic, Cal.

1113
01:08:32,442 --> 01:08:33,842
                     I am.

1114
01:08:34,878 --> 01:08:36,811
              I'm an alcoholic.

1115
01:08:39,249 --> 01:08:41,649
          Okay, happy hour.
          Two for one.

1116
01:08:41,651 --> 01:08:44,486
  - Two for me, none for you.
  - ( Calvin laughs )

1117
01:09:03,507 --> 01:09:06,441
   - Hey, Dexter.
   - Hey, what's up, Calvin?

1118
01:09:06,443 --> 01:09:08,243
                How you doing?

1119
01:09:08,245 --> 01:09:09,744
            So today is the day
            that you announce

1120
01:09:09,746 --> 01:09:12,614
           the Employee
           of the Month, right?

1121
01:09:12,616 --> 01:09:17,585
     - Yeah, why?
     - Well, um, have you
       considered Produce?

1122
01:09:17,587 --> 01:09:20,455
 - He's a hard worker.
 - Now, Cal, I have a soft spot

1123
01:09:20,457 --> 01:09:21,756
     - in my heart
       for that young man.
     - Yeah, I know.

1124
01:09:21,758 --> 01:09:23,358
That's why I hired him
the first time.

1125
01:09:23,360 --> 01:09:25,560
           He's a good boy.
           He's a good guy.

1126
01:09:25,562 --> 01:09:27,562
Now-- now, look, Cal.

1127
01:09:27,564 --> 01:09:30,198
Now, Produce ain't got
the sense God gave a cucumber.

1128
01:09:30,200 --> 01:09:31,933
 - ( inhales sharply )
 - Now, I gotta give that award
  to employee that represent

1129
01:09:31,935 --> 01:09:33,635
what this supermarket
is about.

1130
01:09:33,637 --> 01:09:35,403
This ain't no YMCA
where everybody
gets a trophy.

1131
01:09:35,405 --> 01:09:37,672
            Okay, and with
            all due respect,

1132
01:09:37,674 --> 01:09:41,309
   I think that Produce is
   probably the hardest-working
   employee that you have.

1133
01:09:41,311 --> 01:09:44,279
   I mean he knows
   the name and the SKU number,
   the code or whatever

1134
01:09:44,281 --> 01:09:45,647
   to every piece of fruit
   and vegetable over in your...

1135
01:09:45,649 --> 01:09:47,749
    - Now, Cal.
    - ...section over there.

1136
01:09:47,751 --> 01:09:49,784
Just because the boy's
a retard, he don't get
no special treatment.

1137
01:09:49,786 --> 01:09:52,187
       - You know better
         than that, man.
       - You know what?

1138
01:09:52,189 --> 01:09:54,455
      We don't use the "R" word
      just like we don't
      use the "N" word.

1139
01:09:54,457 --> 01:09:56,224
          - You know?
          - ( sighs )

1140
01:09:56,226 --> 01:09:59,260
     We should be clear
     on our word choice, Dexter.

1141
01:10:10,473 --> 01:10:11,739
          ( Calvin sighs )

1142
01:10:15,979 --> 01:10:18,213
     Let's get out of here.

1143
01:10:18,215 --> 01:10:20,215
                     Hey.

1144
01:10:20,217 --> 01:10:22,517
              Wanna go have
              some fun?

1145
01:10:22,519 --> 01:10:24,419
              Hmm?
              Let's go.

1146
01:10:34,397 --> 01:10:39,534
Well, do you guys wanna
hit the go-karts?

1147
01:10:39,536 --> 01:10:41,569
 - Go-karts? Do we?
 - Yeah! I'll do the go-karts.

1148
01:10:41,571 --> 01:10:44,405
     We were made to hit
     the go-karts, Produce.

1149
01:10:44,407 --> 01:10:45,640
                      Made.

1162

             There you go.

1163
01:11:41,965 --> 01:11:43,765
    ( groans )

1164
01:11:47,871 --> 01:11:49,871
You're making this
hard on me, Milt.

1165
01:11:49,873 --> 01:11:52,073
             Come on,
             don't be soft.

1166
01:11:52,075 --> 01:11:54,876
( sighs )
They call that enabling.

1167
01:11:54,878 --> 01:11:57,478
           It's called testing.
           Good job, you passed.

1168
01:11:57,480 --> 01:11:59,447
             These are actually
             both for me.

1169
01:12:01,751 --> 01:12:04,619
- Where's your family at?
- Franklin's dropping them off.

1170
01:12:05,655 --> 01:12:08,056
            - Hmm.
            - Yeah.

1171
01:12:08,058 --> 01:12:09,757
     - We're playing house.
     - Hmm.

1172
01:12:22,906 --> 01:12:26,474
     All right,
     give me a sip.

1173
01:12:26,476 --> 01:12:31,012
  - Really?
  - Yeah, just a sip, a taste,
   to knock off the edge.

1174
01:12:31,014 --> 01:12:32,613
                 Are you sure
                 about this?

1175
01:12:34,584 --> 01:12:36,617
       One sip.

1176
01:12:36,619 --> 01:12:38,519
    I've been
    real, real good.

1177
01:12:41,524 --> 01:12:43,925
      -<i> ( beer splashes ) </i>
      - Ah, come on.

1178
01:12:43,927 --> 01:12:45,560
            I may have lost
            my drinking buddy,

1179
01:12:45,562 --> 01:12:48,529
      but I still gotta look out
      for my best friend.

1180
01:12:48,531 --> 01:12:50,798
          Besides,
          the beer was terrible.
          Tasted stale.

1181
01:12:50,800 --> 01:12:53,134
           - Did it?
           - No.

1182
01:12:53,136 --> 01:12:54,702
            I just remembered
            I had this.

1183
01:12:54,704 --> 01:12:56,604
      ( scoffs )

1184
01:12:56,606 --> 01:12:58,673
    I don't want
    a sip of that.
    ( clears throat )

1185
01:13:02,879 --> 01:13:04,545
                  Produce:
                  Yeah.

1186
01:13:05,815 --> 01:13:07,815
             Look who we found,
             Mr. Campbell.

1187
01:13:07,817 --> 01:13:09,817
  Produce wanted me
  to come have pizza
  with him.

1188
01:13:09,819 --> 01:13:11,719
              Um...

- How are you? Nice to meet you.

1191
01:13:17,160 --> 01:13:19,160
   - ( whispers ) Nice work.
   - ( laughs )

1197
01:13:32,108 --> 01:13:33,775
         I'll be right there.

1198
01:13:39,449 --> 01:13:40,681

1290

         we just need to ask him
         some questions.

    so I'm gonna get in the car

1293
01:18:50,927 --> 01:18:53,060

       look for him.

01:18:53,062 --> 01:18:54,895
   All right,
   I'm gonna stay here and see

1303
01:19:21,090 --> 01:19:22,456

            at the house.

No, he's not gonna

   I think that he would
   wanna see you.

       You sure?

1375
01:23:19,662 --> 01:23:22,196
        You know, I don't wanna
        get him all worked up.

1376
01:23:22,198 --> 01:23:23,564
            - Okay.
            - So...

1377
01:23:23,566 --> 01:23:26,066
         Okay. Okay.
         You okay?

1378
01:23:26,068 --> 01:23:28,102
                    Yeah.

      Hey, here's the book I got
      that you asked for.

1380
01:23:36,379 --> 01:23:38,278
 Produce:
<i> It's not for me.</i>

1381
01:23:38,280 --> 01:23:40,381
     What are you--
     what are you talking about?

1382
01:23:43,486 --> 01:23:45,486
                   It's for him.

1383
01:23:53,195 --> 01:23:55,529

   to the left upper abdomen,

1384
01:23:55,531 --> 01:23:58,599
   ruptured spleen,
   severe internal bleeding,
   and hypertension.

1385
01:23:58,601 --> 01:24:00,667
                 Should I order
                 an exploratory
                 laparotomy?

1386
01:24:00,669 --> 01:24:03,337
No time.
Make sure we're prepped
for a splenectomy, stat.

I said a prayer, too.

1428

That was the first time
I've actually prayed.

will be okay.

        if that's the way
        it works, sweetheart.

1435
01:27:29,979 --> 01:27:32,813
Well, then, what good is it
to pray if you don't get
what you ask for?

1436
01:27:39,455 --> 01:27:40,687
               Okay.

1437
01:27:43,926 --> 01:27:48,929
       Growing up, did I get you
       everything that you
       ever asked for?

1438
01:27:48,931 --> 01:27:51,331
        - Of course not.
        - No.

1439
01:27:53,636 --> 01:27:55,402
              But I love you
              so much

1440
01:27:55,404 --> 01:27:59,473
              and I want you
              to have everything
              that you want,

1441
01:27:59,475 --> 01:28:01,475

          in your best interest

1442
01:28:01,477 --> 01:28:05,579
      or it's just, uh--
      it's just a hard decision.

1443
01:28:07,483 --> 01:28:09,416
            It's not fair.

1444
01:28:10,486 --> 01:28:12,853
          I'm saying that God...

1445
01:28:14,356 --> 01:28:16,556
      is probably not a genie...

1446
01:28:18,027 --> 01:28:21,495
