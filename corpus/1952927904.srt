00:02:14,116 --> 00:02:17,325
Let's go, let's go./
Got some real hoes waiting.

4
00:02:17,386 --> 00:02:19,127
Oh, my God!
If I didn't want to lick your brother's face,

5
00:02:19,188 --> 00:02:22,328
I'd kick his ass right now.
I'm so gonna kick the shit out of him.

6
00:02:22,692 --> 00:02:24,501
Come on, Gina. Come on, Flaca.

7
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:27,370
What is wrong
with this chicken-poop piece of shit?

8
00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:28,966
Gina, less talking. More pushing.

9
00:02:29,031 --> 00:02:31,739
You could be dancing
with Papito Chulito, lady. Yo, come on!

10
00:02:32,168 --> 00:02:33,579
-Shut up!
-Hey, what's up, girl,

11
00:02:33,636 --> 00:02:35,377
-we gonna be dancing later?
-We're gonna be late.

12
00:02:35,471 --> 00:02:36,711
Don't act like you didn't come here
on the bus.

13
00:02:36,772 --> 00:02:38,513
I saw your ass coming on the bus, shit.

14
00:02:41,844 --> 00:02:43,255
I'm so done with you, Pablo. it's over.

15
00:02:47,083 --> 00:02:50,997
I just wanna remind you,
there's a two-drink minimum tonight.

16
00:02:51,053 --> 00:02:53,761
And for those of you that are underage,
it's illegal,

17
00:02:53,823 --> 00:02:56,497
so please do Cuko a favor
and don't get caught!

18
00:02:56,692 --> 00:02:59,298
And remember to visit the showroom
in front of the club.

19
00:02:59,362 --> 00:03:01,273
We've got products for everybody!

20
00:03:01,330 --> 00:03:05,335
Acne Cure eliminates pimples in hours
instead of days.

21
00:03:05,768 --> 00:03:06,803
Thank you!

22
00:03:08,337 --> 00:03:12,979
These ladies, they are the hottest thing
to hit Chi-Town since the Chicago fire.

23
00:03:13,042 --> 00:03:17,149
The All-Stars ain't got nothing
on these mamichulas.

24
00:03:17,513 --> 00:03:18,685
And if I were them,

25
00:03:18,848 --> 00:03:21,124
I'd be shaking in my panties

26
00:03:21,283 --> 00:03:24,264
for the upcoming battle's grand prize!

27
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:30,630
So let's give it up
for the bootylicious Imported Delight!

28
00:03:35,698 --> 00:03:37,302
Come on, let's go, step!

29
00:03:51,547 --> 00:03:52,958
Girl, they ain't got nothing on you.

30
00:03:53,449 --> 00:03:54,860
Gina, you always say that.

31
00:03:55,618 --> 00:03:57,029
You see? They ain't even that good.

32
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:59,329
I kind of like that.

33
00:03:59,655 --> 00:04:02,135
-I don't even need...
-What? What, girl? I will cut your face.

34
00:04:02,191 --> 00:04:03,192
Gina, Gina,just...

35
00:04:05,561 --> 00:04:07,905
Oh, man! Look at their footwork.

36
00:04:22,511 --> 00:04:23,854
I'm on MySpace, girl.

37
00:04:41,230 --> 00:04:42,732
I want everybody at practice tomorrow.

38
00:04:42,798 --> 00:04:44,539
Okay, I'll be there, Loli. I'll be there.

39
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:46,409
Carmen, I thought we were
kicking it tomorrow.

40
00:04:46,469 --> 00:04:48,176
Nobody's gonna beat my crew.

41
00:04:50,806 --> 00:04:53,548
-So good.
-Get over it. They're nothing.

42
00:04:54,477 --> 00:04:55,820
Ladies, where are you guys going?

43
00:04:55,878 --> 00:04:57,186
-With you.
-Not sticking around?

44
00:04:57,613 --> 00:04:58,853
I don't like this, come on.

45
00:04:58,914 --> 00:05:00,188
-Girl...
-Gee, this is real cute.

46
00:05:00,249 --> 00:05:01,694
I would hate to see you
with blood on your face,

47
00:05:01,751 --> 00:05:03,924
-so keep it moving, real quick.
-I gotta go.

48
00:05:03,986 --> 00:05:05,727
-I got a razor in my tongue and in my hair.
-I'll call you.

49
00:05:05,788 --> 00:05:08,997
No, you won't. No, you won't.
The bitch doesn't talk, so, impossible.

50
00:05:09,058 --> 00:05:11,163
-What are you doing here?
-I was looking for you, baby.

51
00:05:11,227 --> 00:05:13,503
Gina, why don't we just chill for a little bit?

52
00:05:13,562 --> 00:05:15,337
-We can go get some donuts later.
-We're going home, Carmen.

53
00:05:15,397 --> 00:05:17,070
-My treat.
-I'm gonna call you later. I'll call you later.

54
00:05:17,133 --> 00:05:19,409
-We're going home, come on.
-I know.

55
00:05:19,468 --> 00:05:20,572
Hey, you wanna sleep over?

56
00:05:20,636 --> 00:05:23,276
-I'll even let you take me shopping?
-Carmen, why don't you sleep over?

57
00:05:23,339 --> 00:05:24,374
I'll call you tomorrow.

58
00:05:29,545 --> 00:05:32,253
All right, close your books.
it's time for a pop quiz.

59
00:05:33,349 --> 00:05:34,851
What kind of a pop quiz?

60
00:05:35,718 --> 00:05:37,220
A what-the-hell pop quiz.

61
00:05:45,294 --> 00:05:48,275
The psychology profile is something
for you to think about

62
00:05:48,330 --> 00:05:50,901
as you begin to plan your future.

63
00:05:50,966 --> 00:05:53,003
It's designed to help you pick a career

64
00:05:53,068 --> 00:05:56,606
that, maybe later on in your life,
you might not regret.

65
00:06:02,378 --> 00:06:03,618
Salgado.

66
00:06:04,747 --> 00:06:07,421
Would you like to share your aspirations
with the class?

67
00:06:07,917 --> 00:06:08,918
Not really.

68
00:06:08,984 --> 00:06:11,624
Any interests? Any hobbies?

69
00:06:11,954 --> 00:06:13,024
Does slumming count?

70
00:06:13,322 --> 00:06:15,268
-Well, you're the pro.
-Enough.

71
00:06:16,992 --> 00:06:18,164
Miss Salgado.

72
00:06:18,594 --> 00:06:19,834
Hip-hop.

73
00:06:20,696 --> 00:06:23,506
-Hip-hop?
-Forget it.

74
00:06:23,566 --> 00:06:26,103
You wouldn't understand
unless you could dance.

75
00:06:30,806 --> 00:06:31,841
Perhaps.

76
00:06:32,708 --> 00:06:36,349
But right now,
I'm the one asking the questions.

77
00:06:36,579 --> 00:06:38,490
And you're avoiding mine,

78
00:06:38,547 --> 00:06:41,050
which was, "What are your aspirations?"

79
00:06:52,461 --> 00:06:55,067
Hey, you dropped this.

80
00:06:55,130 --> 00:06:56,234
That's not mine.

81
00:06:56,298 --> 00:06:58,505
I know. it's mine.

82
00:07:10,279 --> 00:07:12,418
-Why doesn't this...
-I wish he'd stop torturing us.

83
00:07:12,481 --> 00:07:15,257
Forget about it, girl. Just be happy
that they don't have alive band in there

84
00:07:15,317 --> 00:07:17,092
like Chucho's crazy-ass folks,

85
00:07:17,152 --> 00:07:19,826
busting out sombreros and accordions.

86
00:07:19,889 --> 00:07:21,527
They have accordions?

87
00:07:21,590 --> 00:07:23,433
Yeah, dude, like, real-life accordions.

88
00:07:23,492 --> 00:07:25,472
Like, the little one,
the three-year-old, will be rocking it.

89
00:07:27,196 --> 00:07:29,699
I used to like your dad, now I don't.

90
00:07:33,135 --> 00:07:35,240
Please, can you turn it down? It is so loud.

91
00:07:35,671 --> 00:07:37,241
I disagree. Hey, drunk men.

92
00:07:37,306 --> 00:07:38,546
Who smells like it? You.

93
00:07:39,408 --> 00:07:43,754
-You like it?
-Yeah. I love the look in the cat's eyes.

94
00:07:47,449 --> 00:07:48,928
Go and put it in the room, okay?

95
00:07:49,084 --> 00:07:51,428
Hey, look, look, look. Watch.

96
00:07:53,389 --> 00:07:56,393
-One, two, three. One, two, three.
-How are you doing?

97
00:07:56,458 --> 00:07:59,564
No, don't talk to him.
He's upset his girlfriend broke up with him.

98
00:07:59,628 --> 00:08:00,800
I broke up with her.

99
00:08:01,697 --> 00:08:02,869
I love you so much.

100
00:08:06,468 --> 00:08:07,913
I'm allergic to tomatoes.

101
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:09,413
Where are you going now?

102
00:08:09,471 --> 00:08:10,950
I gotta go do homework.

103
00:08:11,407 --> 00:08:13,444
And then I got practice. Gina!

104
00:08:18,380 --> 00:08:19,916
-Gina.
-Coming.

105
00:08:20,482 --> 00:08:22,928
Looks like you cleaned up for me,
how sweet.

106
00:08:22,985 --> 00:08:25,192
You are such a good friend.

107
00:08:25,254 --> 00:08:27,097
La Virgen, please forgive me for my sins,

108
00:08:27,156 --> 00:08:31,104
'cause I am going to commit a hell
of a lot of them tonight.

109
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:32,935
-Hallelujah.
-Okay.

110
00:08:34,663 --> 00:08:36,665
Yo, hurry up, dude.

111
00:08:36,899 --> 00:08:39,641
Hold up,
I gotta do this stupid profile test for school

112
00:08:39,702 --> 00:08:41,079
to figure out what I wanna be.

113
00:08:41,170 --> 00:08:42,513
Shit, I already know what I wanna be.

114
00:08:43,272 --> 00:08:46,776
-What are you gonna be?
-A Casa Del Pueblo employee.

115
00:08:46,842 --> 00:08:48,185
Until they fire me.

116
00:08:49,244 --> 00:08:50,279
And then what are you gonna do?

117
00:08:51,146 --> 00:08:52,489
Probably end up at Elsa's Funeral Home.

118
00:08:52,548 --> 00:08:54,118
What, until she fires you?

119
00:08:55,751 --> 00:08:57,321
That was really hurtful.

120
00:08:57,653 --> 00:09:00,224
I know what we can be.

121
00:09:00,289 --> 00:09:02,633
We can be... Not strip dancers...

122
00:09:03,225 --> 00:09:04,431
Private dancers!

123
00:09:06,562 --> 00:09:08,667
Come into my world, baby boy.

124
00:09:08,731 --> 00:09:11,302
I need a pole. Where's a pole?
Give me a pole. I need a pole.

125
00:09:11,367 --> 00:09:13,210
Irene, do you have a broom?

126
00:09:13,268 --> 00:09:14,804
She's on her ass right now.

127
00:09:14,870 --> 00:09:15,940
Here you go.

128
00:09:16,005 --> 00:09:17,814
-Will this work for you?
-You gotta hold it for me, okay?

129
00:09:17,873 --> 00:09:20,217
'Cause you so lucky.

130
00:09:20,275 --> 00:09:22,846
They'll love your ass. Sing with me.

131
00:09:22,911 --> 00:09:25,187
And then we come, and we go

132
00:09:25,247 --> 00:09:27,124
And we come and go, we do

133
00:09:27,182 --> 00:09:28,957
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah

134
00:09:29,018 --> 00:09:32,727
What's up? What's up?
What's up? What's up?

135
00:09:32,788 --> 00:09:35,268
Girl, I have to finish this!

136
00:09:35,758 --> 00:09:37,169
You're distracting.

137
00:09:37,726 --> 00:09:39,205
You're lame.

138
00:09:39,895 --> 00:09:41,135
Okay.

139
00:09:43,365 --> 00:09:44,639
Dude, are you gonna finish that taco?

140
00:09:45,434 --> 00:09:47,004
-Do you want it?
-Hell, yeah.

141
00:10:04,686 --> 00:10:07,394
-Okay, you got it. One more time.
-Okay.

142
00:10:17,666 --> 00:10:19,873
-Isn't this the best?
-Yeah.

143
00:10:19,935 --> 00:10:23,815
The sky is your spotlight
and Chicago is your audience.

144
00:10:33,549 --> 00:10:34,721
Pablo!

145
00:10:44,993 --> 00:10:46,267
Hey.

146
00:10:46,895 --> 00:10:48,374
Turn that up.

147
00:10:50,766 --> 00:10:52,245
Get it, girl.

148
00:10:53,469 --> 00:10:54,641
Get it.

149
00:11:10,919 --> 00:11:11,954
Hey!

150
00:11:15,157 --> 00:11:17,501
I hope you're ready for a test.

151
00:11:24,633 --> 00:11:25,703
Dinner.

152
00:11:28,470 --> 00:11:29,574
Sunday?

153
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:32,241
You're paying.

154
00:11:33,509 --> 00:11:34,579
You're picking me up.

155
00:11:42,284 --> 00:11:43,558
Nice pen.

156
00:11:50,125 --> 00:11:51,331
Where you been, fool?

157
00:11:51,426 --> 00:11:53,201
You're messing with my rhythm.
I need my change.

158
00:11:53,262 --> 00:11:56,038
You see these crazy-ass folks acting
like I need to do something here.

159
00:11:56,098 --> 00:11:57,509
-Can I get some help over here?
-What?

160
00:11:57,866 --> 00:11:59,846
-Hi, Mrs. Lopez.
-This is bad.

161
00:12:00,035 --> 00:12:02,743
-I almost cracked one of my teeth with this.
-I'm really sorry about that.

162
00:12:02,804 --> 00:12:06,308
We have the unfrozen kind on sale.
And it's a bigger bag. Aisle seven.

163
00:12:07,676 --> 00:12:09,451
What you gotta say?
I would love to hear what you...

164
00:12:09,511 --> 00:12:11,218
I'm not gonna sell you nothing,
you gonna starve.

165
00:12:12,581 --> 00:12:14,891
-What's wrong with you?
-I said, "Shut up."

166
00:12:16,118 --> 00:12:18,621
Give me that. What you doing to me?

167
00:12:20,255 --> 00:12:22,235
What the... Who buys this?

168
00:12:22,691 --> 00:12:24,261
This is nasty.

169
00:12:24,326 --> 00:12:27,000
I need you to work an extra shift.
Alberto called in sick.

170
00:12:28,564 --> 00:12:30,134
But I got homework.

171
00:12:30,199 --> 00:12:32,110
Where is my change, fool?

172
00:12:32,434 --> 00:12:34,436
'Cause I just can't be eating
all this man's food.

173
00:12:34,570 --> 00:12:36,345
-I got it.
-Okay.

174
00:12:36,438 --> 00:12:38,213
Oh, my God. Hi, store manager.

175
00:12:38,273 --> 00:12:40,480
One more time. One more time.

176
00:12:41,376 --> 00:12:44,118
Hey, you're not focusing, okay?

177
00:12:44,179 --> 00:12:46,591
Chest out.

178
00:12:46,648 --> 00:12:48,650
Look out. There you go.

179
00:12:48,717 --> 00:12:52,426
Out, chest out. There you go.
One more time.

180
00:12:52,721 --> 00:12:54,200
Three and four.

181
00:12:54,256 --> 00:12:55,428
Chest.

182
00:12:56,658 --> 00:12:58,763
Two, three and four.

183
00:13:00,462 --> 00:13:01,839
Good girl.

184
00:13:05,701 --> 00:13:08,204
Open the book to page 367.

185
00:13:08,937 --> 00:13:11,884
Can we keep it down in the peanut gallery?
There's a class going on.

186
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:13,078
Okay, gramps.

187
00:13:16,712 --> 00:13:18,282
We're gonna talk about Skinner today.

188
00:13:19,381 --> 00:13:23,887
Skinner believed
that positive behavior should be rewarded

189
00:13:23,952 --> 00:13:26,933
and negative behavior
should always be ignored.

190
00:13:26,989 --> 00:13:31,699
But I say
negative behavior should never be ignored.

191
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:33,262
For example...

192
00:13:33,328 --> 00:13:36,309
-Hand it over.
-I ain't giving you jack.

193
00:13:36,365 --> 00:13:38,811
-Then you're out of here.
-See, you can't throw me out.

194
00:13:39,201 --> 00:13:41,374
-Really?
-I paid for this class.

195
00:13:41,436 --> 00:13:44,417
And my money pays your salary.

196
00:13:45,674 --> 00:13:47,847
So, you work for me.

197
00:13:50,946 --> 00:13:52,118
Dude, get off me, fool.

198
00:13:52,180 --> 00:13:54,353
-Get out of here.
-Don't touch me, man! Don't touch me!

199
00:13:54,416 --> 00:13:55,588
You are out of here.

200
00:13:56,018 --> 00:13:57,463
Don't touch me, man!

201
00:13:57,953 --> 00:14:00,433
Now, does anybody else wannajoin him
out there?

202
00:14:00,489 --> 00:14:02,196
Because there's plenty of room!

203
00:14:04,626 --> 00:14:07,300
Miss Salgado and Miss Simpson,
may I see you both for a moment?

204
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:20,550
Can either of you explain this?

205
00:14:23,578 --> 00:14:27,048
Well, I obviously don't know about her,
but I study with my private tutor.

206
00:14:27,482 --> 00:14:29,325
You can ask him. I took notes.

207
00:14:30,218 --> 00:14:32,095
Well, then you must be supernatural,

208
00:14:32,154 --> 00:14:35,567
because your mortal ass hasn't been
in class enough to have any notes.

209
00:14:35,624 --> 00:14:38,127
I'll explain what happened.
This bitch copied my test.

210
00:14:38,193 --> 00:14:41,003
Lower your voice. Nobody here's deaf.

211
00:14:41,963 --> 00:14:44,102
This lying bitch cheated.

212
00:14:44,232 --> 00:14:46,439
-Miss Salgado. Miss Salgadoi
-I studied long and hard forthis test.

213
00:14:46,501 --> 00:14:47,809
Seriously, could you handle this?

214
00:14:47,903 --> 00:14:50,213
Otherwise, I'm gonna have to call my lawyer
and file for harassment.

215
00:14:50,272 --> 00:14:53,412
And as far as her accusing me
of copying off of her?

216
00:14:53,508 --> 00:14:55,112
I'm sorry, no. I don't have to do that.

217
00:14:55,177 --> 00:14:56,247
You know you copied my test

218
00:14:56,311 --> 00:14:58,120
because your prissy ass was too lazy
to study.

219
00:14:58,480 --> 00:14:59,584
Prissy is better than poor.

220
00:14:59,748 --> 00:15:02,456
Well, poor is better than puta.

221
00:15:02,517 --> 00:15:05,589
Who taught you how to speak, trash?

222
00:15:05,654 --> 00:15:08,157
Shut up and crawl back under that rock
that you came from.

223
00:15:08,223 --> 00:15:09,395
That's enough!

224
00:15:11,693 --> 00:15:13,934
Both of you know the material so well?

225
00:15:13,995 --> 00:15:18,341
You will take a make-up exam right now.

226
00:15:19,167 --> 00:15:21,738
Why do I have to take another exam
if I didn't do anything wrong?

227
00:15:21,803 --> 00:15:23,578
Consider this your chance
to prove your innocence.

228
00:15:23,638 --> 00:15:24,639
I ain't doing shit.

229
00:15:24,706 --> 00:15:27,312
Listen, you take the exam right now,
or you fail.

230
00:15:27,409 --> 00:15:28,615
End of discussion.

231
00:15:30,212 --> 00:15:33,091
-Whatever. I'll take it.
-No.

232
00:15:34,216 --> 00:15:35,217
This is bullshit.

233
00:15:36,451 --> 00:15:38,954
I'm gonna tell you what bullshit is.
Your attitude.

234
00:15:39,988 --> 00:15:41,228
You think that you can scare me

235
00:15:41,289 --> 00:15:44,736
with some bad-ass-from-the-hood drama?
Are you kidding me?

236
00:15:55,470 --> 00:15:57,143
What does it matter, anyway?

237
00:16:00,442 --> 00:16:03,150
That's right.
So don't even bother, homegirl.

238
00:16:03,211 --> 00:16:06,249
I mean, you know you're gonna end up
working for me someday anyways, right?

239
00:16:10,819 --> 00:16:13,527
Richard, the other student
instigated the situation.

240
00:16:13,655 --> 00:16:16,534
Frank, she practically knocked
her unconscious.

241
00:16:16,591 --> 00:16:20,562
I can't change the rules for that.
I got a board to answer to.

242
00:16:21,062 --> 00:16:22,939
-She's off two weeks.
-Come on.

243
00:16:22,998 --> 00:16:24,773
-Richard...
-Well, she'll be reinstated

244
00:16:24,833 --> 00:16:27,575
when she's served her suspension.

245
00:16:27,636 --> 00:16:30,515
As long as she keeps up with the work,
if you know what I mean.

246
00:16:31,473 --> 00:16:35,285
Frank, please, don't take it personally.

247
00:16:37,145 --> 00:16:40,126
You know, this whole tenure thing.

248
00:16:40,182 --> 00:16:43,095
Well, word in the right ear.

249
00:17:08,610 --> 00:17:10,385
Six, seven, eight...

250
00:17:15,784 --> 00:17:17,286
Just like that.

251
00:18:29,024 --> 00:18:30,025
How you doing?

252
00:18:34,496 --> 00:18:35,668
Keeping up with your assignments?

253
00:18:36,498 --> 00:18:37,499
Why do you care?

254
00:18:40,402 --> 00:18:42,507
The other day I saw you dancing in the park.

255
00:18:47,976 --> 00:18:52,584
What if I told you there was a college
in California you may be interested in?

256
00:18:52,647 --> 00:18:56,925
It's a reputable school.
It offers academic scholarships.

257
00:18:56,985 --> 00:18:59,488
It even has a fine school of dance.

258
00:19:01,756 --> 00:19:03,326
From what I understand,
many of the students

259
00:19:03,391 --> 00:19:06,429
go on to become professional dancers,

260
00:19:06,494 --> 00:19:07,529
if that would interest you.

261
00:19:09,998 --> 00:19:11,568
Carmen, you have talent.

262
00:19:13,501 --> 00:19:15,777
I'll even write a letter of recommendation
for you.

263
00:19:19,841 --> 00:19:23,015
Okay, you know what? Go ahead.
Do your thing and piss your life away.

264
00:19:24,713 --> 00:19:26,920
Why are you working so hard
if you don't wanna be someone?

265
00:19:32,654 --> 00:19:33,689
Take it.

266
00:19:36,524 --> 00:19:37,901
I dare you.

267
00:20:14,062 --> 00:20:16,042
MUa, how's school?

268
00:20:18,366 --> 00:20:19,970
It's good. Fine.

269
00:20:22,203 --> 00:20:23,204
You're a good student.

270
00:20:23,271 --> 00:20:26,650
No, no, no, no. Pops, come on.
"Student," okay?

271
00:20:26,941 --> 00:20:28,318
-Shut up, dude.
-Leave her alone.

272
00:20:28,376 --> 00:20:29,616
-Shut up.
-Hey!

273
00:20:29,678 --> 00:20:31,783
-What's your deal?
-No hats at the dinner table.

274
00:20:31,846 --> 00:20:33,883
What about you, mUo? How's work?

275
00:20:33,982 --> 00:20:38,021
Busy, Pops. We're working
on some dope-ass homes up in Lake Forest.

276
00:20:38,086 --> 00:20:40,692
Nla, they're as big as our zip code,
and I'm making bank.

277
00:20:40,755 --> 00:20:41,790
Bank!

278
00:20:41,856 --> 00:20:44,632
Well if you're making bank,
why don't you go back to school then?

279
00:20:44,693 --> 00:20:47,230
Hey, as far as I can count,
I'm making a lot more moolathan you,

280
00:20:47,295 --> 00:20:48,797
-so don't be giving me advice.
-Whatever.

281
00:20:48,863 --> 00:20:50,809
Hey, why don't you pay some
of the bills then?

282
00:20:50,865 --> 00:20:53,368
Hey, at least I got wheels, bro.

283
00:20:53,435 --> 00:20:55,278
Shoot! I'm gonna start charging for gas, too.

284
00:20:55,336 --> 00:20:57,782
It costs big chavos, Nla,
to transport heavy load.

285
00:20:58,540 --> 00:21:01,419
I know you are not talking about me.
I will kick you in your...

286
00:21:01,476 --> 00:21:04,889
No! Get away! I just pushed your ass from
Western to Kinzie and I see you don't even...

287
00:21:04,946 --> 00:21:08,018
My wrist hurts
from holding that broken mirror all the time.

288
00:21:10,085 --> 00:21:12,031
You know what? You're all wagging.
You two better shut up

289
00:21:12,087 --> 00:21:14,158
or you'll be hitchhiking with esa loser.

290
00:21:14,222 --> 00:21:15,428
Whatever!

291
00:21:15,490 --> 00:21:18,494
-Esa loser
-Ese loser

292
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:20,904
-Come on, Mom.
-Ese loser. Pop it up, pop it up.

293
00:21:21,262 --> 00:21:24,300
MUa, can you help me
in the kitchen tonight?

294
00:21:24,365 --> 00:21:26,242
I have to prepare the food for the church.

295
00:21:26,401 --> 00:21:29,382
Mom, I gotta meet the dancers
at the club tonight.

296
00:21:29,437 --> 00:21:30,711
Maybe some other time.

297
00:21:31,773 --> 00:21:33,878
Is that all you think about?

298
00:21:33,942 --> 00:21:35,285
How are you gonna make a good wife

299
00:21:35,343 --> 00:21:37,118
when you don't know how
to take care of your home?

300
00:21:37,378 --> 00:21:38,857
I don't wanna be a wife like that, Mom.

301
00:21:47,322 --> 00:21:50,201
Mom, I'm really sorry,
I didn't mean it like that.

302
00:21:52,827 --> 00:21:54,135
Why don't you take your punk ass
back to school

303
00:21:54,195 --> 00:21:56,175
-and learn some goddamn manners?
-Why don't you shut up?

304
00:21:56,231 --> 00:21:57,369
Yeah? You think you're gonna
go somewhere,

305
00:21:57,432 --> 00:21:59,070
shaking your little skinny ass
on a raggedy stage

306
00:21:59,134 --> 00:22:01,944
in front of hoochies and thugs
who can't even spell their own name?

307
00:22:02,003 --> 00:22:05,712
Hey, who made you Professor Escalante?
As far as I remember, you dropped out.

308
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:07,280
-Yeah.
-Why don't you shut your damn mouth?

309
00:22:07,342 --> 00:22:08,787
I know what I'm talking about, all right?

310
00:22:08,843 --> 00:22:10,516
I've done what you've done,
and I've been there before,

311
00:22:10,578 --> 00:22:11,852
and you go nowhere.

312
00:22:11,913 --> 00:22:13,790
You stay in school
and you get a good education.

313
00:22:13,848 --> 00:22:15,521
And you shut your damn mouth,
you sloppy-ass loser...

314
00:22:15,583 --> 00:22:17,358
-Why don't you make me?
-Look at you.

315
00:22:17,418 --> 00:22:18,658
You're a disgrace, man. Grow up.

316
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:20,666
You think you're gonna be a little goofball
and all that shit?

317
00:22:20,722 --> 00:22:23,259
-Who do you think you are, man?
-What you gonna do, get in my face now?

318
00:22:23,324 --> 00:22:25,304
-Yeah, yeah, come on.
-Get on up, you sloppy mouth over here.

319
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:28,170
Little kid, little baby over here,
talking about your car.

320
00:22:28,229 --> 00:22:30,470
-Yeah, yeah. Get up, Gina! Yeah!
-We'll do it right now!

321
00:22:30,765 --> 00:22:32,540
That's what you do!
You wanna do something...

322
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:34,602
I swear to God!

323
00:22:35,503 --> 00:22:36,811
Okay.

324
00:22:37,939 --> 00:22:39,714
-Is that what you gonna do?
-Yeah!

325
00:22:39,774 --> 00:22:42,254
-Come on! Come on!
-Seriously?

326
00:22:42,310 --> 00:22:43,448
-Come on! Come on!
-Do it! Swing!

327
00:22:43,511 --> 00:22:46,048
-Come on! Get in my face then, huh?
-You stop that! I'm sick of your shit!

328
00:22:46,114 --> 00:22:47,115
Three and four and five.

329
00:22:47,182 --> 00:22:48,217
-Let's go!
-Get out of my face!

330
00:22:48,283 --> 00:22:49,626
-Go! Swing it!
-Don't spit on me!

331
00:22:49,684 --> 00:22:50,754
Shut up!

332
00:22:51,820 --> 00:22:54,664
All-Stars have the big battle next month!

333
00:22:54,722 --> 00:22:57,396
Tonight they're gonna show us
what they've got.

334
00:23:04,032 --> 00:23:05,568
That's my girl!

335
00:23:12,373 --> 00:23:14,819
-Go, Gina Gi.
-You got me.

336
00:23:21,950 --> 00:23:23,293
Carmen!

337
00:23:27,355 --> 00:23:28,857
You got it, girl!

338
00:23:37,999 --> 00:23:39,808
Stop hanging on my man.

339
00:24:47,168 --> 00:24:48,374
Why you always making me look bad?

340
00:24:48,436 --> 00:24:50,313
I'm sorry. I don't know what happened.

341
00:24:50,371 --> 00:24:54,615
-I just messed up, Loli, and I'm so sorry.
-I can't count on anybody.

342
00:24:54,676 --> 00:24:55,746
-I'm sorry.
-Just focus on your feet

343
00:24:55,810 --> 00:24:57,881
doing what they're supposed to.

344
00:24:58,746 --> 00:25:01,352
I'll see you at practice tomorrow.

345
00:25:01,416 --> 00:25:03,987
-Where's Gina? You seen Gina?
-Shit!

346
00:25:04,052 --> 00:25:06,396
Pablito, seen Gina?

347
00:25:08,489 --> 00:25:10,230
No, man.

348
00:25:10,291 --> 00:25:12,430
Let me ask you something.

349
00:25:12,493 --> 00:25:14,131
You like my girl?

350
00:25:15,430 --> 00:25:17,876
-What?
-Do you like my girl?

351
00:25:24,172 --> 00:25:26,049
-No, man.
-Keep it that way.

352
00:25:27,275 --> 00:25:31,280
When you see Gina,
you tell her I was looking for her, all right?

353
00:25:32,146 --> 00:25:34,922
There's a three-drink minimum.
I don't see 15 beers here.

354
00:25:35,483 --> 00:25:38,191
You're my boy, Pablito. I owe you one.

355
00:25:38,386 --> 00:25:39,592
Hey, Jesse.

356
00:25:39,754 --> 00:25:41,392
Aren't you gonna do your shit
for us tonight?

357
00:25:41,456 --> 00:25:43,936
I don't know.
What, you're too good for us now?

358
00:25:43,992 --> 00:25:46,472
No, man. I just wanna go home
and do my shit in the toilet.

359
00:25:46,527 --> 00:25:48,029
-Carmen, you ready?
-Yeah.

360
00:25:48,096 --> 00:25:49,507
-I gotta go.
-Come on, stay, stay, girl.

361
00:25:49,897 --> 00:25:51,342
You just got here.

362
00:25:51,399 --> 00:25:52,707
Come here. Gina!

363
00:26:12,987 --> 00:26:14,261
Come on, let's go. You're late.

364
00:26:16,557 --> 00:26:18,628
Five, six... Jump in.

365
00:26:22,263 --> 00:26:24,504
-Hey, girl.
-Hey.

366
00:26:24,899 --> 00:26:26,742
Where you been? I've been waiting for you.

367
00:26:26,801 --> 00:26:27,836
You have?

368
00:26:28,469 --> 00:26:29,470
Why, what's the matter?

369
00:26:29,537 --> 00:26:32,575
I have a math quiz on Friday,
and I'm not sure about some questions.

370
00:26:32,740 --> 00:26:35,516
-Really? Math, huh?
-Yeah.

371
00:26:37,245 --> 00:26:39,225
Wait. Don't you have homework?

372
00:26:41,182 --> 00:26:43,992
No, I already did my homework.

373
00:26:46,921 --> 00:26:48,832
All right, mama, have a good night, okay?

374
00:26:49,223 --> 00:26:50,293
Bye.

375
00:26:53,694 --> 00:26:56,072
Where are you going? You just got home.

376
00:26:56,631 --> 00:26:57,632
I'm going out.

377
00:26:58,833 --> 00:27:00,540
Enough dancing, hUa.

378
00:27:01,669 --> 00:27:03,273
Be home early.

379
00:27:03,337 --> 00:27:04,407
Bye.

380
00:27:31,699 --> 00:27:33,007
What you got, girl?

381
00:27:33,601 --> 00:27:36,047
Loli, you go, girl. You got this.

382
00:27:37,238 --> 00:27:40,219
Loli! Loli! Loli!

383
00:27:50,485 --> 00:27:52,055
No, she didn't.

384
00:27:52,353 --> 00:27:53,923
All right. Hold this.

385
00:27:53,988 --> 00:27:56,798
Do it! Work it, work it! Work your magic, girl.

386
00:27:56,991 --> 00:27:58,095
Shake it!

387
00:29:03,691 --> 00:29:04,897
Hi.

388
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:07,366
Hey.

389
00:29:08,930 --> 00:29:10,204
You came.

390
00:29:11,532 --> 00:29:12,909
Where am I?

391
00:29:16,404 --> 00:29:18,315
This is my best friend, Gina.

392
00:29:19,307 --> 00:29:21,583
Hi, Gina, best friend.

393
00:29:23,344 --> 00:29:24,516
Hello.

394
00:29:24,579 --> 00:29:26,923
-Hi.
-Hi.

395
00:29:31,285 --> 00:29:34,129
Come on. I hope you're hungry.

396
00:29:34,188 --> 00:29:36,099
Hungry? Are you hungry?

397
00:29:40,528 --> 00:29:42,439
What about these?

398
00:29:42,496 --> 00:29:43,531
No.

399
00:29:45,032 --> 00:29:46,375
All right.

400
00:29:48,069 --> 00:29:52,449
So, we're not eating here, are we?

401
00:29:52,506 --> 00:29:56,682
No, but I'm paying, remember?

402
00:29:56,744 --> 00:29:59,850
And I get an employee discount.

403
00:29:59,914 --> 00:30:01,825
What about these?

404
00:30:01,882 --> 00:30:04,328
You know, I think I had those yesterday.

405
00:30:04,385 --> 00:30:05,887
Great.

406
00:30:05,953 --> 00:30:07,125
Great.

407
00:30:09,590 --> 00:30:12,161
-Smell this.
-What is it?

408
00:30:12,226 --> 00:30:14,763
It's a Mexican vegetable.

409
00:30:20,534 --> 00:30:23,378
So, what do you want for dessert?

410
00:30:23,437 --> 00:30:28,511
You know, you better pick,
because I don't recognize anything.

411
00:30:28,576 --> 00:30:30,817
That's funny.

412
00:30:30,878 --> 00:30:32,357
You're serious.

413
00:30:33,714 --> 00:30:35,489
Hello.

414
00:30:35,549 --> 00:30:36,789
So, Jared.

415
00:30:37,618 --> 00:30:41,065
Tell me, where do you live?

416
00:30:41,555 --> 00:30:42,659
Evanston.

417
00:30:43,691 --> 00:30:44,863
Fancy!

418
00:30:45,693 --> 00:30:47,036
Did you get my discount?

419
00:30:47,094 --> 00:30:51,167
I got your discount, girl, and I got mine.
it's two for one tonight.

420
00:30:51,232 --> 00:30:53,803
So you need to put some meat
on those bones.

421
00:30:53,868 --> 00:30:56,747
Because I know
how you white boys like them, okay?

422
00:30:56,804 --> 00:30:59,512
-You saw that? Okay.
-I'll get you tomorrow.

423
00:30:59,573 --> 00:31:00,950
You better.

424
00:31:02,843 --> 00:31:04,481
-Bye, Gina.
-Wait.

425
00:31:05,846 --> 00:31:07,018
Take me with you, yeah?

426
00:31:07,114 --> 00:31:09,390
Love you. Call you later.

427
00:31:09,450 --> 00:31:10,554
I hate this place.

428
00:31:14,789 --> 00:31:15,790
What is it?

429
00:31:16,590 --> 00:31:18,592
It's a big, fat potato chip.

430
00:31:20,294 --> 00:31:21,295
Take a bite.

431
00:31:22,129 --> 00:31:23,130
Come on.

432
00:31:24,398 --> 00:31:28,039
I'll tell you what. I'll take a bite,
but if something happens to me,

433
00:31:28,102 --> 00:31:29,945
-it's completely your fault.
-Fair enough.

434
00:31:47,221 --> 00:31:48,791
Are you okay?

435
00:31:48,856 --> 00:31:51,359
-Oh, my God.
-Yeah. Actually, it's not that bad.

436
00:31:51,425 --> 00:31:54,702
See? Told you.

437
00:31:54,762 --> 00:31:57,709
As long as we don't know what it is.

438
00:31:57,765 --> 00:31:59,711
I told my mom to stop telling me

439
00:31:59,767 --> 00:32:03,476
'cause this one time, she told me
I ate french fries, and they were worms!

440
00:32:03,838 --> 00:32:04,839
Why?

441
00:32:06,107 --> 00:32:08,587
Latin people, we eat everything.

442
00:32:08,676 --> 00:32:10,747
Cow intestines or...

443
00:32:10,811 --> 00:32:13,087
No, I think pig intestines. Cow tongue.

444
00:32:13,614 --> 00:32:15,218
Bull's balls.

445
00:32:17,485 --> 00:32:19,362
Chicken feet.

446
00:32:19,420 --> 00:32:21,058
Beef brains.

447
00:32:22,423 --> 00:32:24,130
-Eyeballs!
-Hey, don't worry about me

448
00:32:24,191 --> 00:32:26,171
'cause that one was real.

449
00:32:29,096 --> 00:32:30,268
Sorry.

450
00:32:55,456 --> 00:32:58,596
So, do you come here a lot?

451
00:32:58,659 --> 00:33:01,401
Yeah.

452
00:33:01,462 --> 00:33:03,601
Yeah, I really do, actually.

453
00:33:08,402 --> 00:33:11,178
-Dance with me!
-You don't want me to do that.

454
00:33:11,405 --> 00:33:13,407
-Why not?
-Because I'll probably kill you.

455
00:33:13,574 --> 00:33:15,645
Shut up. Come on.

456
00:33:15,709 --> 00:33:17,154
It's really easy, okay?

457
00:33:17,211 --> 00:33:19,316
So, you're gonna walk forward
with this foot.

458
00:33:19,380 --> 00:33:22,554
-And then, step back with that foot.
-Okay.

459
00:33:23,317 --> 00:33:24,853
And then, one, two, three.

460
00:33:28,022 --> 00:33:29,626
I am so sorry! Are you okay?

461
00:33:29,690 --> 00:33:31,169
It's fine. Totally fine.

462
00:33:31,225 --> 00:33:36,607
-I am such a clutz.
-it's okay. I'll just wear boots next time.

463
00:33:36,664 --> 00:33:37,870
Just kidding.

464
00:33:38,732 --> 00:33:40,075
Okay, ready?

465
00:33:40,134 --> 00:33:42,478
You know what part I do know?

466
00:33:46,474 --> 00:33:47,817
Wow!

467
00:34:08,696 --> 00:34:10,198
Bookworm.

468
00:34:11,732 --> 00:34:14,372
Stop it. Stop it!

469
00:34:14,435 --> 00:34:16,073
-Quit it!
-I will not quit it.

470
00:34:16,136 --> 00:34:17,513
That's it. Come on!

471
00:34:17,571 --> 00:34:19,949
You are so going down!

472
00:34:20,007 --> 00:34:23,181
-Am I?
-Yes. Yes, you are.

473
00:34:23,244 --> 00:34:24,279
No!

474
00:34:25,279 --> 00:34:28,886
Okay, okay. He's here.
I'll call you later, I promise. Bye.

475
00:34:37,124 --> 00:34:38,762
-Hey.
-Hi.

476
00:34:39,260 --> 00:34:43,436
I hope you're hungry,
because I totally blew off practice today.

477
00:35:06,954 --> 00:35:08,991
Come on, come on, please.

478
00:35:14,895 --> 00:35:16,897
Gina, take out the trash.

479
00:35:52,866 --> 00:35:54,641
You're so beautiful.

480
00:36:17,424 --> 00:36:21,566
So, Carmen, it's great to finally meet you.

481
00:36:21,629 --> 00:36:25,270
Jared's been keeping you quite a secret.
Tell us about yourself.

482
00:36:25,332 --> 00:36:26,709
Dad, she's not one of your clients.

483
00:36:26,767 --> 00:36:28,440
I should hope not.

484
00:36:28,502 --> 00:36:31,176
I sell medical devices, call on physicians.

485
00:36:31,238 --> 00:36:34,447
By the way, what a beautiful name you have.

486
00:36:34,508 --> 00:36:36,249
Carmen. How original.

487
00:36:36,810 --> 00:36:41,452
Are your parents big opera fans?
Is that what gave them the idea?

488
00:36:41,515 --> 00:36:44,496
No. They named me after the saint,
Maria del Carmen.

489
00:36:44,551 --> 00:36:49,364
I have five cousins, two friends, an aunt
and a neighbor's dog with the same name.

490
00:36:49,757 --> 00:36:52,033
-A dog?
-Oh, my.

491
00:36:54,628 --> 00:36:56,369
So, Carmen is an awesome dancer.

492
00:36:58,165 --> 00:37:00,475
She's been showing me
some new dance steps,

493
00:37:00,534 --> 00:37:01,979
-among other moves.
-Really?

494
00:37:02,903 --> 00:37:06,680
Did Jared tell you that I used to be a dancer?

495
00:37:07,708 --> 00:37:10,518
Well, that was a long time ago.

496
00:37:11,779 --> 00:37:15,158
-You can dance for me any time.
-Honey, behave!

497
00:37:17,818 --> 00:37:19,229
I'm so sorry.

498
00:37:19,286 --> 00:37:20,321
So, Carmen,

499
00:37:20,621 --> 00:37:22,532
what type of dance do you do?

500
00:37:23,057 --> 00:37:24,434
-Hip-hop.
-Hip-hop?

501
00:37:24,558 --> 00:37:28,563
Ls that like the old bebop from the '50s,
with just a little bit of cha-cha-cha?

502
00:37:29,496 --> 00:37:30,566
Wonderful!

503
00:37:31,999 --> 00:37:33,637
How are your lessons coming, Son?

504
00:37:33,767 --> 00:37:38,011
Great. Yeah, I think I'm almost ready
for my public debut.

505
00:37:39,406 --> 00:37:43,013
Now, Carmen, tell me,
where do you do your dance?

506
00:37:43,077 --> 00:37:44,920
Logan Square.

507
00:37:44,978 --> 00:37:46,457
Logan Square?

508
00:37:47,848 --> 00:37:48,849
Jay.

509
00:37:49,917 --> 00:37:52,090
People get mugged down there.

510
00:37:52,152 --> 00:37:53,495
People get mugged everywhere, Mother.

511
00:37:53,554 --> 00:37:56,330
Still! Honey, it's not safe.

512
00:37:56,390 --> 00:37:58,063
She's right on this one, Son.

513
00:37:58,692 --> 00:38:01,935
If you're gonna take over
the family business, I need you in one piece.

514
00:38:01,995 --> 00:38:07,411
Sweetie, you know how my anxiety disorder

515
00:38:07,468 --> 00:38:09,914
takes on just at a drop of a hat.

516
00:38:09,970 --> 00:38:11,847
-Do you need a pill?
-Just the other half.

517
00:38:11,905 --> 00:38:14,545
Don't upset your mother, Son.

518
00:38:14,608 --> 00:38:16,053
-For goodness's sake...
-All right!

519
00:38:20,948 --> 00:38:24,589
It's just, I feel like I'm living
in The Truman Show here.

520
00:38:28,622 --> 00:38:32,297
If Logan Square is good enough for Carmen,
then it's good enough for me.

521
00:38:35,395 --> 00:38:36,772
Fine, dear.

522
00:38:38,265 --> 00:38:40,939
So, Carmen,

523
00:38:41,001 --> 00:38:46,144
would you happen to live
in a gated community? Please say, "Yes."

524
00:38:46,473 --> 00:38:48,248
Yeah, sort of.

525
00:38:48,308 --> 00:38:50,117
We have bars on our windows and doors.

526
00:38:52,212 --> 00:38:53,350
How resourceful.

527
00:39:19,606 --> 00:39:21,882
-Hey, girl.
-Hey.

528
00:39:21,942 --> 00:39:24,479
-Hi, Pa.
-Hey, mUa.

529
00:39:24,545 --> 00:39:25,615
How's school?

530
00:39:26,246 --> 00:39:29,193
It was good. Had a test today, it was easy.

531
00:39:30,918 --> 00:39:32,591
This came for you.

532
00:39:39,226 --> 00:39:40,261
You opened my mail?

533
00:39:43,030 --> 00:39:44,031
You had no right!

534
00:39:44,097 --> 00:39:45,838
And you have a right to lie to me
and your mother?

535
00:39:50,304 --> 00:39:53,649
Did you hurt someone?
I asked you, did you hurt someone?

536
00:39:53,707 --> 00:39:55,015
You don't understand, okay?

537
00:39:55,075 --> 00:39:57,180
I had to defend myself.
She was accusing me of cheating!

538
00:39:57,244 --> 00:39:59,485
Is this the way we teach you
to defend yourself?

539
00:40:00,214 --> 00:40:02,854
You defend yourself
by getting a good education.

540
00:40:03,417 --> 00:40:05,488
-How would you know?
-Watch your mouth.

541
00:40:05,552 --> 00:40:07,589
You never win by using your hands.

542
00:40:07,721 --> 00:40:09,257
Dad, I can take care of myself, okay?

543
00:40:09,323 --> 00:40:10,734
Like this?

544
00:40:11,792 --> 00:40:14,898
What kind ofjob are you going to get
if you're always in trouble?

545
00:40:14,962 --> 00:40:17,067
I don't know.
Anything's better than what you do.

546
00:40:19,032 --> 00:40:22,241
I'm gonna stick up for myself.
You're a coward.

547
00:40:22,903 --> 00:40:25,509
You let people step on you, and that's why
you're still picking up garbage.

548
00:40:25,572 --> 00:40:27,882
What are you saying, little puta bitch?

549
00:40:27,941 --> 00:40:30,683
You think you're the shit?
You're no better than garbage.

550
00:40:30,744 --> 00:40:31,950
Shut up and mind your own business.

551
00:40:32,012 --> 00:40:34,549
You're talking to my parents
like some kind of alley rat.

552
00:40:34,615 --> 00:40:35,719
That's my business!

553
00:40:36,149 --> 00:40:37,457
Punk.

554
00:40:37,517 --> 00:40:39,963
I'm a punk? Well, then, you're a loser.

555
00:40:40,020 --> 00:40:43,229
You're 26 years old, and you're still living
with Mom and Dad. That's pathetic!

556
00:40:43,290 --> 00:40:44,792
-You're a loser!
-Calling me a loser?

557
00:40:44,858 --> 00:40:46,701
-Leave her alone!
-Get out of the way!

558
00:41:06,246 --> 00:41:09,420
-Pablojust lunged.
-Get out of here. Oh, my God!

559
00:41:09,483 --> 00:41:13,932
I'm so upset I missed it.
I wish I had a front-row seat. Who won?

560
00:41:14,988 --> 00:41:16,058
I don't know.

561
00:41:16,423 --> 00:41:18,801
I'm proud of you. You got balls, girl.

562
00:41:18,859 --> 00:41:21,305
Sometimes you just gotta fight
for your right to party.

563
00:41:21,361 --> 00:41:22,499
They said it best.

564
00:41:22,562 --> 00:41:26,169
Freedom! Freedom!

565
00:41:31,038 --> 00:41:33,609
Don't worry about her, dude,
don't even worry about her.

566
00:41:33,674 --> 00:41:35,881
She'll be out by midnight, anyway.
You know what I'm saying?

567
00:41:35,943 --> 00:41:38,389
And that's when the fun starts!

568
00:41:38,445 --> 00:41:42,393
We'll party, get ready.
Practice for when we get our own place.

569
00:41:42,449 --> 00:41:43,621
A loft in the skies.

570
00:41:45,385 --> 00:41:49,162
It'll be great.
And we'll get a little dog named Chip,

571
00:41:49,222 --> 00:41:50,530
and we'll call him Chipito.

572
00:41:51,792 --> 00:41:52,827
-Yeah?
-Yeah!

573
00:41:53,393 --> 00:41:56,863
And throw parties,
and have flowers and all that pretty stuff.

574
00:41:59,032 --> 00:42:00,978
Okay.

575
00:42:01,034 --> 00:42:03,310
Maybe I should've done this a long time ago.

576
00:42:03,737 --> 00:42:04,738
Come over here.

577
00:42:06,573 --> 00:42:09,349
I love you now. Yes. I'm making you food.

578
00:42:09,409 --> 00:42:11,912
Look at this. 63 cents at Casa del Pueblo.

579
00:42:11,979 --> 00:42:13,754
Discount, 19 cents.

580
00:42:13,814 --> 00:42:16,158
This expired, April '05.

581
00:42:16,216 --> 00:42:19,561
No, dude, it's best before April '05.

582
00:42:19,619 --> 00:42:21,326
Doesn't mean it's not good after.

583
00:42:21,588 --> 00:42:25,001
So, you can see Cuko's
got the hookup. Right.

584
00:42:25,058 --> 00:42:27,163
From Cali, the one and the only,

585
00:42:27,594 --> 00:42:28,971
Beat Freaks!

586
00:42:51,351 --> 00:42:53,456
Break it down! Break it down! Break it down!

587
00:43:25,085 --> 00:43:26,496
Hit it!

588
00:43:56,416 --> 00:43:58,020
That was sick.

589
00:44:04,958 --> 00:44:06,198
Damn it!

590
00:44:08,028 --> 00:44:09,439
You're back.

591
00:44:14,668 --> 00:44:16,204
You're leaving Chavez?

592
00:44:18,638 --> 00:44:19,981
Did you get your application in?

593
00:44:24,111 --> 00:44:25,351
Just go.

594
00:44:39,226 --> 00:44:42,639
You are senile!
You are completely out of control!

595
00:44:42,729 --> 00:44:43,969
Oh, my God!

596
00:44:44,030 --> 00:44:47,876
I pay for everything.
We don't need to talk about allowances, Nla!

597
00:44:49,503 --> 00:44:51,073
-She pays rent or gets out!
-You know what...

598
00:44:51,571 --> 00:44:52,982
-You pay rent or get out.
-You, too.

599
00:44:53,039 --> 00:44:54,541
-Do not disrespect her!
-You, too.

600
00:44:54,608 --> 00:44:57,054
-Get away.
-Should just leave your ass!

601
00:44:57,110 --> 00:45:00,922
Hey, girl! Okay, you found that.

602
00:45:00,981 --> 00:45:03,825
Well, see, the situation is, like,
you know I get heart palpitations

603
00:45:03,884 --> 00:45:08,799
and I need Irene's menudo in my mouth.
So... Hello! Hello?

604
00:45:11,124 --> 00:45:15,129
Wow, look at that. That's where they are.
I've been looking for these.

605
00:45:15,195 --> 00:45:17,300
I was looking for the rest of my menudo.

606
00:45:17,931 --> 00:45:19,933
Can you believe somebody ate it?

607
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,002
-Crazy business.
-Who could it be?

608
00:45:22,068 --> 00:45:23,775
Who would ever? it's obnoxious.

609
00:45:23,837 --> 00:45:26,374
We gotta go to Irene's.
I wanna get some more taquitos.

610
00:45:26,439 --> 00:45:28,510
I need some taquitos in my life.

611
00:45:28,575 --> 00:45:29,815
With a Pablito on the side.

612
00:45:32,913 --> 00:45:35,325
No, stop it right now. I don't hear you.

613
00:45:35,382 --> 00:45:37,589
I'm so hungry. Oh, my God!

614
00:45:37,651 --> 00:45:39,653
-Can't you just give me one more spoonful?
-I'm so hungry too

615
00:45:39,719 --> 00:45:41,323
so let's go get something to eat.

616
00:45:41,388 --> 00:45:43,629
Down. So down.
But I'm just gonna change real quick

617
00:45:43,690 --> 00:45:46,569
because somebody didn't do the laundry
like I paid her to do!

618
00:45:49,229 --> 00:45:52,676
I'm totally rocking these pajama pants
because they know me.

619
00:45:53,867 --> 00:45:55,244
Oh, my God.

620
00:45:56,036 --> 00:45:57,743
-What?
-Gina!

621
00:45:57,837 --> 00:46:00,443
-Okay, Carmen, don't go there, all right?
-Don't go there?

622
00:46:00,674 --> 00:46:02,449
-It ain't nothing!
-What?

623
00:46:02,509 --> 00:46:04,546
You remember when I got into that fight
with that hoochie shorty?

624
00:46:04,611 --> 00:46:07,353
I swear to God, she just jumped me,
all guerilla-style.

625
00:46:07,414 --> 00:46:09,826
Next time I see her,
I'm gonna totally cut her face.

626
00:46:09,883 --> 00:46:11,089
You do not deserve this.

627
00:46:11,151 --> 00:46:13,290
-Carmen, please. All right?
-No!

628
00:46:13,353 --> 00:46:14,991
-Listen...
-No, this is bullshit!

629
00:46:15,956 --> 00:46:16,991
Nine's coming around, okay?

630
00:46:17,057 --> 00:46:19,333
He's treating me
just like your boyfriend is, okay?

631
00:46:19,392 --> 00:46:22,134
Look, he even got me this.

632
00:46:22,195 --> 00:46:24,266
Sexy lingerie.

633
00:46:25,498 --> 00:46:27,034
Trust me, girl.

634
00:46:28,401 --> 00:46:31,507
No. No, I do not trust you.

635
00:46:32,872 --> 00:46:34,215
What if this was happening to me?

636
00:46:34,274 --> 00:46:37,153
But it's not happening to you.
It doesn't happen to you.

637
00:46:37,210 --> 00:46:39,747
It's happening to me.
And I can handle it, okay?

638
00:46:39,813 --> 00:46:41,759
So just let me take care of my shit.

639
00:46:42,015 --> 00:46:43,153
Cool?

640
00:46:44,217 --> 00:46:47,892
But I'm totally losing weight right now.
Come on, we gotta go!

641
00:46:47,954 --> 00:46:49,524
I need to get some food in...

642
00:46:49,589 --> 00:46:52,365
Carmen, we gotta feed my booty.

643
00:46:52,425 --> 00:46:54,405
Feed, feed, my booty
Feed...

644
00:48:31,791 --> 00:48:33,168
You never change.

645
00:48:33,760 --> 00:48:35,671
Always taking the job with you.

646
00:48:35,829 --> 00:48:36,830
Marina.

647
00:48:37,530 --> 00:48:39,168
Sit down, please.

648
00:48:40,934 --> 00:48:43,744
-You know, it's really good to see you.
-You, too.

649
00:48:47,240 --> 00:48:50,119
I was really surprised to hear from you.

650
00:48:50,777 --> 00:48:51,881
Yeah.

651
00:48:54,414 --> 00:48:57,657
How's the advertising business?

652
00:48:57,717 --> 00:48:59,094
It's good.

653
00:48:59,486 --> 00:49:01,488
Closing up a big account this week.

654
00:49:01,721 --> 00:49:04,463
-Where have I heard that before?
-I know.

655
00:49:04,524 --> 00:49:08,336
So, did you ever settle down?
Have any kids?

656
00:49:08,661 --> 00:49:12,336
That would be a no and a no.
it's too much overhead.

657
00:49:17,937 --> 00:49:19,678
I was wondering
about the market these days.

658
00:49:19,973 --> 00:49:21,953
Any potential openings coming up?

659
00:49:22,008 --> 00:49:23,009
Why do you ask?

660
00:49:26,546 --> 00:49:28,787
I was thinking I could use a change
of scenery.

661
00:49:29,048 --> 00:49:31,528
I thought you wanted to teach.

662
00:49:31,584 --> 00:49:34,064
You know, be around youthful energy

663
00:49:34,120 --> 00:49:37,590
and women who would be attentive
to your every need.

664
00:49:43,029 --> 00:49:46,738
Marina, I was wondering
if you would take this back,

665
00:49:47,567 --> 00:49:49,672
in case something opens up.

666
00:49:54,073 --> 00:49:57,111
You know what, Frank?
I don't think it's a good idea.

667
00:49:57,410 --> 00:50:00,289
Why? You don't think I can hack it anymore?

668
00:50:02,749 --> 00:50:06,060
Yeah. Times have changed.

669
00:50:08,922 --> 00:50:10,094
Wow.

670
00:50:10,824 --> 00:50:12,565
Times have changed.

671
00:50:17,030 --> 00:50:18,100
I should go.

672
00:50:32,579 --> 00:50:34,616
You take care, Frank.

673
00:50:46,326 --> 00:50:49,637
Okay, for those of you that don't know me,
my name is Cuko.

674
00:50:49,696 --> 00:50:51,539
Welcome to my kingdom!

675
00:50:56,302 --> 00:51:00,273
Okay, okay. Tonight is the night
we've all been waiting for!

676
00:51:00,340 --> 00:51:05,187
The grand battle of Armageddon
between the All-Stars

677
00:51:05,245 --> 00:51:07,657
and Imported Delight!

678
00:51:07,714 --> 00:51:10,058
We're gonna have hot, sweaty bodies,

679
00:51:10,116 --> 00:51:12,221
moving, shaking and grooving!

680
00:51:12,285 --> 00:51:15,732
Let's get the party started! DJ, kick it!

681
00:54:16,502 --> 00:54:17,503
Thank you.

682
00:54:50,536 --> 00:54:52,277
What you got, Loli?

683
00:54:57,744 --> 00:54:58,882
Get her, Loli!

684
00:54:58,945 --> 00:55:00,219
Come on!

685
00:55:36,015 --> 00:55:39,588
All-Stars! All-Stars! All-Stars! All-Stars!

686
00:55:39,986 --> 00:55:43,763
All-Stars! All-Stars! All-Stars! All-Stars!

687
00:55:43,823 --> 00:55:47,703
All-Stars! All-Stars! All-Stars! All-Stars!

688
00:55:47,760 --> 00:55:50,366
All-Stars! All-Stars! All-Stars!

689
00:55:52,098 --> 00:55:53,236
Can I walk you up?

690
00:55:53,666 --> 00:55:56,977
No, thanks. I'm just gonna go to sleep.

691
00:55:59,806 --> 00:56:01,149
Can you pick me up from work tomorrow?

692
00:56:01,340 --> 00:56:02,512
Sure.

693
00:56:03,009 --> 00:56:07,583
Hey, my parents are going out of town
in a few weeks,

694
00:56:07,647 --> 00:56:10,992
and, I don't know, I was thinking maybe

695
00:56:11,050 --> 00:56:13,394
we can use your employee discount,
have a few people over?

696
00:56:14,620 --> 00:56:15,621
Sure.

697
00:56:17,123 --> 00:56:18,466
Is everything okay?

698
00:56:21,460 --> 00:56:22,962
I'll see you tomorrow, okay?

699
00:56:44,083 --> 00:56:45,255
Who's there?

700
00:56:47,653 --> 00:56:50,497
-Hey! What up, girl?
-Hey, Carmen.

701
00:56:50,556 --> 00:56:51,626
Come join the party, baby.

702
00:56:51,691 --> 00:56:53,364
Papi, don't stay stuff like that. Come on.

703
00:56:53,426 --> 00:56:54,905
Carmen! Carmen!

704
00:56:54,961 --> 00:56:56,770
Papi, come on.

705
00:56:59,131 --> 00:57:01,509
Excuse me, beautiful.

706
00:57:01,567 --> 00:57:03,376
You must be Carmen.

707
00:57:03,436 --> 00:57:05,780
I've heard a lot about you
from your girl, Gina.

708
00:57:05,838 --> 00:57:08,182
I'm Juan. What's up?

709
00:57:10,409 --> 00:57:12,446
Give me another hit, papi.

710
00:57:15,948 --> 00:57:17,450
-I don't want it like that!
-Just lick it off!

711
00:57:17,516 --> 00:57:20,395
-I don't want it like that!
-Shut up! Just lick it off!

712
00:57:22,588 --> 00:57:24,090
Hey, how about we...

713
00:57:24,156 --> 00:57:26,636
Look. I'm kind of bored.

714
00:57:26,692 --> 00:57:29,764
Nine's busy doing his thing,
and I ain't trying to get in the way.

715
00:57:29,829 --> 00:57:31,706
You know what I'm saying?

716
00:57:31,764 --> 00:57:33,937
How about you and me hanging out?

717
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:35,638
Maybe getting buzzed together?

718
00:57:35,701 --> 00:57:37,942
I don't do that shit.

719
00:57:38,004 --> 00:57:39,108
Neither do I.

720
00:57:39,171 --> 00:57:41,913
I just thought you might,
you know, 'cause you're her friend.

721
00:57:41,974 --> 00:57:43,510
We could do something else.

722
00:57:43,576 --> 00:57:45,988
-Maybe, we can go back to...
-Don't touch me.

723
00:57:46,045 --> 00:57:49,788
-Why you gotta disrespect?
-Let go of me, you piece of shit! Gina!

724
00:57:51,083 --> 00:57:53,029
Gina, get this dog off of me!

725
00:57:53,252 --> 00:57:56,495
-Gina, get this dog off...
-I'll give it to you like you never had before!

726
00:57:56,555 --> 00:57:57,556
Crazy bitch!

727
00:57:57,623 --> 00:57:59,398
-Gina...
-Bro, give her something to relax.

728
00:57:59,458 --> 00:58:01,460
-Carmen, are you okay?
-Sit your fat ass down!

729
00:58:01,527 --> 00:58:03,438
-Papi, come on.
-Hey, don't call her a fat ass!

730
00:58:03,496 --> 00:58:04,531
Get the hell out of here.

731
00:58:04,597 --> 00:58:06,372
-Carmen, what you gonna do, Carmen?
-What are you gonna do?

732
00:58:06,432 --> 00:58:07,740
You gonna hit me like you do Gina?
Go ahead.

733
00:58:07,800 --> 00:58:09,108
-I'm not scared of you!
-Have you been talking shit?

734
00:58:09,168 --> 00:58:11,614
-I am not scared of you! Let go of her!
-I haven't been saying anything.

735
00:58:11,671 --> 00:58:14,515
I said, "Let go of her!" No? Don't touch you?

736
00:58:15,875 --> 00:58:18,788
Papi, I'm so sorry about that, I am so sorry!
I'm gonna straighten her out, okay?

737
00:58:18,844 --> 00:58:21,017
Relax, relax. I'm gonna take care of it.
Get off!

738
00:58:21,080 --> 00:58:23,185
What are you gonna do now, Nino?
You gonna hit me? Hit me!

739
00:58:23,449 --> 00:58:25,827
-Hit me, you piece of shit!
-Let's get out of here.

740
00:58:25,885 --> 00:58:27,660
-Keep talking, Carmen.
-Yeah, I will!

741
00:58:27,720 --> 00:58:28,892
-I'm not scared of you, okay?
-Carmen...

742
00:58:29,355 --> 00:58:30,629
Papi, please.

743
00:58:30,690 --> 00:58:32,499
-I am not scared of you.
-Please. Carmen!

744
00:58:32,558 --> 00:58:35,539
-Get the hell out of here.
-I'm gonna see you two bitches later.

745
00:58:35,594 --> 00:58:38,438
Gina, I want this shit picked up
by the time I get back.

746
00:58:38,497 --> 00:58:40,101
-You got me?
-Okay, Papi. All right!

747
00:58:40,166 --> 00:58:41,577
-Carmen, I will see you later.
-Get out.

748
00:58:41,634 --> 00:58:43,636
-Stop it, please.
-See both of you later.

749
00:58:44,337 --> 00:58:45,839
Piece of shit.

750
00:58:48,541 --> 00:58:50,987
Girl, what the hell's up with you tonight?
Come on.

751
00:58:51,043 --> 00:58:52,545
What are you doing?

752
00:58:52,611 --> 00:58:55,319
Carmen, please, not now. All right?

753
00:58:55,548 --> 00:58:57,585
Well, then when?

754
00:58:57,650 --> 00:59:00,927
When you're in the emergency room?
Is that when I should start?

755
00:59:00,987 --> 00:59:02,933
You are acting like a total idiot.

756
00:59:02,989 --> 00:59:05,026
That's right, because I forgot.

757
00:59:05,091 --> 00:59:08,095
You're all high and mighty now
because you got a rich, white boyfriend!

758
00:59:08,361 --> 00:59:10,307
What? Gina...

759
00:59:10,363 --> 00:59:13,139
Nino loves me, okay?

760
00:59:13,199 --> 00:59:15,907
Gina, listen to me. Listen to me!

761
00:59:17,169 --> 00:59:19,672
Nino does not love you!

762
00:59:19,739 --> 00:59:21,116
This is not love!

763
00:59:22,408 --> 00:59:24,752
-You think your man loves you?
-Yeah.

764
00:59:25,044 --> 00:59:26,648
Why do you think he's with you, hoochie?

765
00:59:27,279 --> 00:59:29,259
Because you jump when he calls.

766
00:59:29,315 --> 00:59:31,158
-Gina...
-You're just a stupid-ass bitch, just like me!

767
00:59:31,217 --> 00:59:33,128
-Stop it!
-Just stop acting like you're any better.

768
00:59:33,185 --> 00:59:34,858
-I said just stop it.
-'Cause once he gets bored,

769
00:59:34,920 --> 00:59:36,263
-he's gonna go on to the next pussy!
-Stop it, okay?

770
00:59:36,322 --> 00:59:37,892
-'Cause you ain't nobody!
-Shut up!

771
00:59:37,957 --> 00:59:39,197
Shut up!

772
00:59:42,228 --> 00:59:43,866
You ain't nobody!

773
00:59:46,665 --> 00:59:49,373
I ain't taking your crazy life anymore!

774
00:59:53,606 --> 00:59:56,553
Carmen. Carmen, I'm sorry, all right?

775
00:59:56,609 --> 00:59:58,987
I messed up, all right? I wasjustjoking.

776
01:00:02,048 --> 01:00:03,823
Flaca, where are you going?

777
01:00:08,454 --> 01:00:10,263
You're all I've got.

778
01:00:37,416 --> 01:00:38,861
Baby, come on.

779
01:00:38,918 --> 01:00:41,159
Make out with me, baby.

780
01:00:41,220 --> 01:00:43,257
-Wake up.
-All right, baby.

781
01:00:44,223 --> 01:00:45,463
Baby.

782
01:00:46,559 --> 01:00:47,629
Hey.

783
01:00:49,095 --> 01:00:52,542
-You've been talking shit?
-No, baby. I would never...

784
01:00:53,399 --> 01:00:57,347
Baby, please! That's sore, please.
Please, please.

785
01:00:57,403 --> 01:01:00,247
-You've been talking shit?
-No, baby. I didn't say anything.

786
01:01:01,006 --> 01:01:04,112
-You've been talking shit?
-No, baby, I would never say anything bad.

787
01:01:04,176 --> 01:01:05,450
-Baby...
-What'd you say to her?

788
01:01:05,511 --> 01:01:07,855
-Baby!
-What did you say to that bitch?

789
01:01:07,947 --> 01:01:09,324
I didn't... I didn't say...

790
01:01:09,381 --> 01:01:11,918
-What'd you say to that bitch?
-I can't...

791
01:01:11,984 --> 01:01:14,328
I can't breathe! What the hell!

792
01:01:14,386 --> 01:01:16,992
-What did you say to her?
-I said that I love you. I love you.

793
01:01:17,056 --> 01:01:18,399
How does that feel?

794
01:01:18,457 --> 01:01:21,666
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I tried to talk...

795
01:01:21,727 --> 01:01:23,900
I'm sorry. I'm sorry!

796
01:01:23,963 --> 01:01:26,500
-I'm sorry!
-Tell me how it... Just shut the...

797
01:01:27,867 --> 01:01:29,676
Tell me how it feels.

798
01:01:29,735 --> 01:01:31,544
Tell me, would you?

799
01:01:31,604 --> 01:01:33,709
Tell me how this feels, Gina!

800
01:01:39,678 --> 01:01:41,248
Tell me how that feels!

801
01:01:44,550 --> 01:01:45,654
Gina, please talk to me.

802
01:01:46,018 --> 01:01:48,658
Gina? Gina, Gina, please wake up.

803
01:01:48,721 --> 01:01:51,793
Please wake up, baby. Please wake up.

804
01:01:51,857 --> 01:01:54,030
Please wake up, baby.

805
01:01:54,093 --> 01:01:56,505
I'm sorry.

806
01:01:56,562 --> 01:01:57,768
Why don't you wake up?

807
01:01:57,830 --> 01:02:00,401
Baby, wake up. God, what's happening?

808
01:02:02,501 --> 01:02:03,741
On, God.

809
01:02:38,804 --> 01:02:40,147
She loved you.

810
01:02:41,707 --> 01:02:44,551
She knows that you loved her.

811
01:02:44,610 --> 01:02:47,181
She does, hUa.

812
01:02:47,246 --> 01:02:50,716
It's not your fault, mi amor.
it's gonna be all right.

813
01:02:59,158 --> 01:03:01,934
It's gonna be all right.

814
01:04:23,575 --> 01:04:25,418
You know that dance school
you told me about?

815
01:04:26,712 --> 01:04:30,785
-Any news?
-Yeah, they want me to audition.

816
01:04:31,283 --> 01:04:32,284
Congratulations.

817
01:04:33,886 --> 01:04:36,264
I wanted to thank you, but I'm not going.

818
01:04:39,158 --> 01:04:40,262
I don't understand.

819
01:04:40,326 --> 01:04:41,828
I just can't waste any more time on it.

820
01:04:42,528 --> 01:04:45,634
Waste your time?
Is that what this has been?

821
01:04:45,698 --> 01:04:47,234
Look, I got problems
that you don't know about, okay?

822
01:04:47,299 --> 01:04:49,575
-So do I.
-it's not that easy.

823
01:04:49,668 --> 01:04:52,615
You know what's not easy? This.

824
01:04:52,671 --> 01:04:55,242
Every time I hear your excuses.

825
01:04:55,307 --> 01:04:57,753
You just wanna stay where you are

826
01:04:57,810 --> 01:05:00,256
so you can complain for the rest of your life,

827
01:05:00,612 --> 01:05:02,990
"There's not enough of opportunities
in the world."

828
01:05:03,048 --> 01:05:06,029
You wouldn't know an opportunity
if it landed right in front of your face!

829
01:05:06,318 --> 01:05:10,027
Who the hell do you think you are,
judging people by your own rules?

830
01:05:10,089 --> 01:05:13,093
You don't know me.
You don't know my family, okay?

831
01:05:13,158 --> 01:05:14,603
You don't even know yourself.

832
01:05:14,660 --> 01:05:16,162
You are such a snob.

833
01:05:16,228 --> 01:05:18,071
You don't give a shit about your students.

834
01:05:18,130 --> 01:05:20,076
And that's why you're leaving,
because you're the quitter.

835
01:05:20,132 --> 01:05:21,338
I didn't quit!

836
01:05:23,736 --> 01:05:26,842
You think you're the only one
with problems? Think again.

837
01:05:27,706 --> 01:05:29,879
You haven't seen anything yet.

838
01:05:29,942 --> 01:05:32,422
Nobody cares about your problems.

839
01:05:32,478 --> 01:05:36,324
Nobody cares about anything
except what you could do for them!

840
01:05:46,725 --> 01:05:47,795
I'm sorry.

841
01:05:59,338 --> 01:06:02,842
There's a part of me that wants to tell you,

842
01:06:03,709 --> 01:06:06,155
"You're right. It doesn't matter."

843
01:06:08,147 --> 01:06:09,717
But I can't, in my good conscience.

844
01:06:13,819 --> 01:06:16,026
I don't know why I believe in you
when I don't even know you.

845
01:06:18,991 --> 01:06:22,996
You see, it has nothing to do
with me believing in you,

846
01:06:23,295 --> 01:06:26,742
and everything to do
with you believing in you.

847
01:06:28,867 --> 01:06:30,210
Take it from me,

848
01:06:32,137 --> 01:06:33,810
running is a hard habit to break.

849
01:06:45,217 --> 01:06:46,958
Got a surprise for you.

850
01:06:47,019 --> 01:06:48,760
It's your favorite.

851
01:06:54,860 --> 01:06:55,964
I'm sorry about Gina.

852
01:06:58,530 --> 01:07:01,534
Wish there was something I could do.

853
01:07:01,600 --> 01:07:02,840
You have to move on for her.

854
01:07:04,269 --> 01:07:05,339
She would want that.

855
01:07:08,440 --> 01:07:09,475
I know.

856
01:07:16,682 --> 01:07:19,959
I was thinking of auditioning
for a dance school in California.

857
01:07:21,854 --> 01:07:23,492
California.

858
01:07:25,357 --> 01:07:26,427
Wow.

859
01:07:28,760 --> 01:07:32,674
But I changed my mind after everything.

860
01:07:38,070 --> 01:07:40,175
You know, I have some news
that might cheer you up.

861
01:07:42,741 --> 01:07:43,845
After this semester,

862
01:07:44,643 --> 01:07:46,645
I'm gonna work for my dad,

863
01:07:46,712 --> 01:07:47,986
get my own place.

864
01:07:48,947 --> 01:07:49,982
Really?

865
01:07:50,048 --> 01:07:53,052
Yeah, yeah.
I figure it's about time I live alone.

866
01:07:53,919 --> 01:07:55,626
No, I mean about working for your dad.

867
01:07:57,022 --> 01:08:02,131
Sure, yeah. I mean,
I'd never have to worry about getting fired.

868
01:08:02,194 --> 01:08:05,801
Or 401(k) retirement.

869
01:08:05,864 --> 01:08:08,401
I mean, my friends would kill for this job.

870
01:08:08,467 --> 01:08:10,105
I'd be an idiot not to take it.

871
01:08:10,335 --> 01:08:14,181
And plus, the place I'm getting,

872
01:08:14,239 --> 01:08:15,479
I think there's room for two.

873
01:08:19,645 --> 01:08:22,922
Wow, that's serious.

874
01:08:23,448 --> 01:08:26,054
But, aren't we serious?

875
01:08:27,786 --> 01:08:30,630
I mean, we spend all
of our time together anyway.

876
01:08:30,689 --> 01:08:33,033
The only thing that would change is

877
01:08:33,091 --> 01:08:34,968
we'd be under the same roof.

878
01:08:51,143 --> 01:08:53,248
I don't know.

879
01:08:54,246 --> 01:08:55,884
I just haven't danced, you know?

880
01:09:07,092 --> 01:09:08,469
I love you.

881
01:09:14,733 --> 01:09:16,041
Say something.

882
01:09:33,085 --> 01:09:35,463
I gotta go.

883
01:09:35,520 --> 01:09:37,557
I gotta go.

884
01:09:37,623 --> 01:09:39,000
Enjoy your...

885
01:10:06,151 --> 01:10:09,064
Hey, that's Somaya. Hey, Somaya!

886
01:10:09,121 --> 01:10:11,294
-Hey, Somaya! Wait up!
-Pablo.

887
01:10:11,356 --> 01:10:12,426
Pablo, come on. Let's go.

888
01:10:12,491 --> 01:10:14,027
It'll only take a couple minutes.
I'll be right back.

889
01:10:14,092 --> 01:10:15,264
-No, it won't...
-Somaya, hold up!

890
01:10:16,795 --> 01:10:18,502
-Somaya!
-Pablo. Fine, I'm driving your car.

891
01:10:18,563 --> 01:10:20,975
How've you been? So, I was thinking,
maybe we get together later?

892
01:10:21,199 --> 01:10:22,872
-I could show you...
-Yeah?

893
01:10:22,934 --> 01:10:24,914
-I got some tunes. I got some...
-You do?

894
01:10:24,970 --> 01:10:27,507
Yeah, yeah, I can spin at you.
You heard me, right?

895
01:10:27,572 --> 01:10:29,609
Oh, yeah, you saw me, right?

896
01:10:32,344 --> 01:10:34,051
-Excuse me.
-You don't need to mess with this guy.

897
01:10:34,479 --> 01:10:35,856
I got the... He come back later.

898
01:10:35,914 --> 01:10:37,757
-Come on, lady.
-Sure you don't wanna come?

899
01:10:37,816 --> 01:10:39,989
I'll take you, too.

900
01:10:40,052 --> 01:10:43,659
-I got a full tank of gas.
-Pablo!

901
01:10:44,690 --> 01:10:45,862
Damn it.

902
01:10:46,758 --> 01:10:47,930
Pablo.

903
01:10:48,860 --> 01:10:49,964
Pablo!

904
01:10:50,395 --> 01:10:51,567
Pablo!

905
01:10:57,669 --> 01:11:00,081
Hey, girl. How's it going tonight?

906
01:11:00,138 --> 01:11:02,414
Damn, look at my hair already.

907
01:11:02,774 --> 01:11:04,048
You got any gel on you?

908
01:11:06,144 --> 01:11:08,556
That's my song, right there.

909
01:11:11,216 --> 01:11:12,456
Hey, you gonna come back to practice?

910
01:11:15,420 --> 01:11:17,366
Just because you suck sometimes
doesn't mean you suck.

911
01:11:18,323 --> 01:11:20,860
Next battle, $1,500.

912
01:11:21,159 --> 01:11:22,638
We got it hooked up.

913
01:11:24,529 --> 01:11:26,440
Damn, this stuff is so sticky.

914
01:11:26,498 --> 01:11:28,034
Get it all over the place.

915
01:11:29,334 --> 01:11:31,041
That's my song.

916
01:11:35,807 --> 01:11:37,184
Still got your boyfriend?

917
01:11:37,242 --> 01:11:39,244
Things going all right?

918
01:11:39,311 --> 01:11:40,381
Yeah.

919
01:11:40,445 --> 01:11:42,118
You better hang on to him.

920
01:11:42,814 --> 01:11:44,225
Loli, let's go!

921
01:13:26,718 --> 01:13:29,221
I just wanna be a little kid again.

922
01:13:32,224 --> 01:13:35,433
I want Gina back,
and I want us to be kids again.

923
01:13:38,230 --> 01:13:40,642
I remember like it was yesterday.

924
01:13:42,500 --> 01:13:44,138
Yeah.

925
01:13:45,136 --> 01:13:47,776
I want yesterday back.

926
01:13:54,446 --> 01:13:58,155
I just don't know who I'm supposed
to be anymore, you know?

927
01:13:59,351 --> 01:14:01,126
I'm going crazy, Pa.

928
01:14:05,824 --> 01:14:08,134
Heaven knows, I regret so much.

929
01:14:12,430 --> 01:14:15,707
You know, the first time I ever walked
into a school

930
01:14:17,035 --> 01:14:20,676
was to sign your brother, Jesse,
up for kindergarten.

931
01:14:23,408 --> 01:14:25,718
I couldn't even read
those forms really good.

932
01:14:29,180 --> 01:14:32,787
I came to this country with no money.

933
01:14:32,851 --> 01:14:34,694
No English.

934
01:14:36,388 --> 01:14:39,198
I joined the army to become a citizen.

935
01:14:44,963 --> 01:14:46,169
I hurt people, too.

936
01:14:49,267 --> 01:14:52,805
That's why I know you can never win
by using your hands.

937
01:14:54,606 --> 01:14:56,176
But it's not like that for you.

938
01:14:56,508 --> 01:14:58,385
You have an education.

939
01:14:59,744 --> 01:15:01,121
You...

940
01:15:05,383 --> 01:15:07,624
MUa, I don't know how to speak,

941
01:15:10,188 --> 01:15:12,099
but one thing I learned is

942
01:15:14,059 --> 01:15:16,801
you always have more strength
than you think.

943
01:15:21,132 --> 01:15:22,770
He makes sure of that.

944
01:15:26,104 --> 01:15:28,345
You can do it.

945
01:15:31,009 --> 01:15:32,113
Pa.

946
01:15:36,181 --> 01:15:37,558
I love you.

947
01:17:47,812 --> 01:17:49,223
Are you crazy? it's raining.

948
01:17:50,448 --> 01:17:51,552
I didn't see you over there.

949
01:17:51,883 --> 01:17:53,123
I was enjoying it.

950
01:17:53,718 --> 01:17:55,163
Are you feeling okay?

951
01:17:55,253 --> 01:17:56,323
You're the one in the rain.

952
01:18:01,860 --> 01:18:04,170
I'm feeling pretty good these days.

953
01:18:04,229 --> 01:18:07,369
Partly due to you.

954
01:18:07,432 --> 01:18:08,502
What did I do now?

955
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:11,105
Well, you taught me a great lesson.

956
01:18:11,169 --> 01:18:12,273
Like what?

957
01:18:14,105 --> 01:18:15,846
Second chances don't discriminate.

958
01:18:25,783 --> 01:18:28,059
You know,
I feel like this isn't just about me anymore.

959
01:18:33,224 --> 01:18:34,259
Good luck on yourjourney.

960
01:18:36,427 --> 01:18:37,531
Same to you.

961
01:18:42,800 --> 01:18:47,146
Did you get struck
by Latin lightning or something?

962
01:18:47,205 --> 01:18:50,209
What the hell.

963
01:18:50,275 --> 01:18:52,016
I don't believe it.

964
01:18:53,278 --> 01:18:56,623
-it's pretty wild.
-Yeah, it's pretty good.

965
01:19:19,671 --> 01:19:20,672
Hey, girl.

966
01:19:22,140 --> 01:19:23,744
I broke up with Jared.

967
01:19:26,611 --> 01:19:27,954
Yeah.

968
01:19:30,381 --> 01:19:32,292
It was tough,

969
01:19:36,187 --> 01:19:37,962
but gotta do what you gotta do, right?

970
01:19:39,424 --> 01:19:43,395
My dance routine is looking really good.

971
01:19:43,461 --> 01:19:46,670
I think you're gonna love the ending.

972
01:19:48,299 --> 01:19:50,142
I miss yo u.

973
01:20:02,914 --> 01:20:06,452
Look, Carm, I made it for you. You like it?

974
01:20:08,319 --> 01:20:09,855
Oh, my God. I love it.

975
01:20:11,322 --> 01:20:13,199
And so does the boogeyman!

976
01:20:16,194 --> 01:20:18,435
I'm the tickling monster!

977
01:20:18,496 --> 01:20:20,601
Are you still convinced you're not ticklish?

978
01:20:20,665 --> 01:20:24,340
I don't think so, buddy. I don't think so.

979
01:20:26,070 --> 01:20:27,674
I have something for you.

980
01:20:44,989 --> 01:20:46,127
You made this for me?

981
01:20:46,791 --> 01:20:48,202
For your dream.

982
01:20:54,699 --> 01:20:56,042
Thank you.

983
01:21:12,383 --> 01:21:13,384
Okay.

984
01:21:28,266 --> 01:21:29,904
Miss Carmen Salgado?

985
01:21:36,007 --> 01:21:38,851
Carmen, you take forever,
we're gonna be late.

986
01:21:38,910 --> 01:21:41,015
Hey, now don't be nervous, okay?
Remember everything we did.

987
01:21:41,079 --> 01:21:42,558
Remember?
Remember that one move I showed you?

988
01:21:42,613 --> 01:21:45,287
You can start with the heartbeat.

989
01:21:45,717 --> 01:21:46,752
Remember, answer the phone?

990
01:21:46,818 --> 01:21:49,662
Pick up the phone. Answer the phone.
Who is it? Who is it?

991
01:21:49,721 --> 01:21:51,223
No, can't talk right now.

992
01:21:51,589 --> 01:21:53,296
Remember? You want me to show you
the Superman again?

993
01:21:53,458 --> 01:21:54,960
It's like...

994
01:21:56,127 --> 01:21:57,765
Now, don't get nervous.

995
01:21:57,829 --> 01:21:58,967
You look like you're nervous.

996
01:21:59,030 --> 01:22:02,409
It says here you don't have
a dancing background.

997
01:22:05,370 --> 01:22:06,440
No.

998
01:22:06,504 --> 01:22:09,815
We gonna get this one, girl.
We gonna get this.

999
01:22:10,141 --> 01:22:13,315
You're gonna move to LA.
You're gonna have a life.

1000
01:22:14,412 --> 01:22:16,358
You're not gonna be like Jesse and me.

1001
01:22:16,414 --> 01:22:19,020
You know, he's all, whatever.
And you can get out of here.

1002
01:22:19,917 --> 01:22:22,625
Remember what Mom always said.
"Go for it!"

1003
01:22:24,555 --> 01:22:28,731
This is a rigorous program
that only admits exceptionally trained talent.

1004
01:22:29,127 --> 01:22:31,368
Do you honestly believe
you meet the criteria?

1005
01:22:33,765 --> 01:22:36,803
Stay focused, stay focused.
You wanna go over anything?

1006
01:22:36,868 --> 01:22:39,439
You want me to show you
the heartbeat again?

1007
01:22:39,504 --> 01:22:40,744
The puppets?

1008
01:22:40,805 --> 01:22:42,079
This is your time, girl. This is your time.

1009
01:22:42,140 --> 01:22:45,747
You go out there
and do this for the Salgado family, shoot.

1010
01:22:45,810 --> 01:22:48,723
Don't make me get out there
and show them what's up.

1011
01:22:49,647 --> 01:22:50,682
Just stay focused.

1012
01:23:11,569 --> 01:23:12,741
Okay, just think good thoughts.

1013
01:23:12,837 --> 01:23:15,909
Remember we used to play in the park?

1014
01:23:15,973 --> 01:23:19,318
It was me, you and Gina.
Just think about those days.

1015
