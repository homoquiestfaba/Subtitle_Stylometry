3
00:01:31,254 --> 00:01:32,722
You're alive?

4
00:02:26,458 --> 00:02:29,010
What are you dreaming, little angel?

5
00:04:46,875 --> 00:04:48,043
Well...

6
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:53,464
Try again.

7
00:04:54,486 --> 00:04:56,670
Well that's the best
I can do for now.

8
00:04:56,681 --> 00:04:57,700
I'm really grateful, Doctor.

9
00:04:57,711 --> 00:04:59,596
I'll be getting some
overtime next week.

10
00:04:59,607 --> 00:05:01,166
You pay me when you can.

11
00:05:01,191 --> 00:05:03,073
Here, I got these for you.

12
00:05:03,758 --> 00:05:05,690
My wife works out
at Farm 22.

13
00:05:05,725 --> 00:05:07,125
Thank you.

14
00:05:08,001 --> 00:05:09,489
See you next time.

15
00:05:10,641 --> 00:05:13,815
Keep gettin' paid in fruit
and we'll pickin' these ourselves.

16
00:05:17,266 --> 00:05:19,104
Hello, sleepyhead.

17
00:05:20,718 --> 00:05:21,876
Hi.

18
00:05:23,258 --> 00:05:24,798
How do you feel?

19
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:27,923
OK.

20
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:29,987
Any pain anywhere?

21
00:05:30,097 --> 00:05:31,144
No.

22
00:05:31,816 --> 00:05:33,862
- Numbness?
- Huh?

23
00:05:35,263 --> 00:05:36,970
Motor dysfunction?

24
00:05:37,486 --> 00:05:39,378
I'm a little hungry.

25
00:05:40,327 --> 00:05:41,650
Eat this.

26
00:05:41,846 --> 00:05:43,729
Get your sugar levels up.

27
00:05:50,770 --> 00:05:52,947
Taste receptors are working.

28
00:05:53,954 --> 00:05:55,423
Thank you.

29
00:05:55,657 --> 00:05:58,971
You'll like this a whole lot better
with the peel off.

30
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:02,371
I don't mean to be rude,

31
00:06:02,566 --> 00:06:04,746
but am I supposed
to know you?

32
00:06:05,522 --> 00:06:08,239
Actually, we haven't met.

33
00:06:08,414 --> 00:06:10,429
I'm Dr. Dyson Ido.

34
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:11,937
This is Nurse Gerhad.

35
00:06:13,611 --> 00:06:15,948
Do you know who I am?

36
00:06:17,821 --> 00:06:20,871
Well... we were hoping
you'd fill in that part.

37
00:06:21,682 --> 00:06:24,398
Since you're a total
replacement cyborg.

38
00:06:24,464 --> 00:06:26,878
And most of your cyber body
was destroyed.

39
00:06:26,996 --> 00:06:28,948
We can't find any record.

40
00:06:28,975 --> 00:06:31,396
But your very human brain...

41
00:06:31,637 --> 00:06:33,977
...is miraculously intact.

42
00:06:34,593 --> 00:06:37,391
Theoretically you should
remember something.

43
00:06:37,402 --> 00:06:38,345
Oh...

44
00:06:39,002 --> 00:06:40,156
Well...

45
00:06:41,158 --> 00:06:43,236
It still pretty blank.

46
00:06:44,692 --> 00:06:47,549
No, it's completely blank, actually.

47
00:06:51,530 --> 00:06:53,752
I don't even know
my own name.

48
00:06:58,341 --> 00:07:00,341
Let's look at the bright side.

49
00:07:01,147 --> 00:07:03,384
Your tears are working.

50
00:07:15,139 --> 00:07:16,441
Hmm...

51
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:19,765
It's so good.

52
00:07:20,671 --> 00:07:22,063
What do you call this?

53
00:07:48,935 --> 00:07:50,141
What's that?

54
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:51,432
Zalem.

55
00:07:52,216 --> 00:07:55,033
The last of the great sky cities.

56
00:07:56,628 --> 00:07:58,271
What holds it up?

57
00:07:58,282 --> 00:07:59,434
Magic?

58
00:07:59,445 --> 00:08:01,694
No.
Something stronger.

59
00:08:01,719 --> 00:08:03,266
Engineering.

60
00:08:07,638 --> 00:08:09,266
Hey...!

61
00:08:09,868 --> 00:08:13,587
And down here we have
Iron City with all its charm.

62
00:08:13,612 --> 00:08:15,327
Dr. Dyson Ido.

63
00:08:15,666 --> 00:08:16,977
That's you.

64
00:08:17,339 --> 00:08:19,969
While I'm learning names,
do you have one for me?

65
00:08:21,493 --> 00:08:22,666
Alita.

66
00:08:26,955 --> 00:08:28,337
It's a nice name.

67
00:08:29,171 --> 00:08:30,649
I love it!

68
00:08:31,054 --> 00:08:32,321
Can I keep it?

69
00:08:32,354 --> 00:08:34,712
At least until I can remember
my real name.

70
00:08:34,737 --> 00:08:36,344
- Hmm...
- Thank you.

71
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:38,635
OK.

72
00:08:39,502 --> 00:08:41,502
- Do you want to take a look?
- Yes.

73
00:08:46,898 --> 00:08:48,806
Why there's so many languages?

74
00:08:48,831 --> 00:08:51,013
After The Big War i've told you...

75
00:08:51,038 --> 00:08:53,153
- The Fall.
- After The Fall...

76
00:08:53,178 --> 00:08:54,898
...only Zalem was left...

77
00:08:54,923 --> 00:08:58,240
...and survivors came here
from all over the world.

78
00:08:59,031 --> 00:09:01,176
Everybody down here
works for Zalem.

79
00:09:01,194 --> 00:09:03,365
Factory.
Farm.

80
00:09:03,390 --> 00:09:06,078
Does anyone ever go to Zalem?
We should go.

81
00:09:06,102 --> 00:09:07,985
Nobody from down here ever go top.

82
00:09:07,996 --> 00:09:09,788
It's a rule that never broken.

83
00:09:19,409 --> 00:09:20,790
What is that?

84
00:09:21,718 --> 00:09:23,329
It's Motorball.

85
00:09:23,772 --> 00:09:25,461
That's so cool.

86
00:09:25,524 --> 00:09:28,326
Nothing you need to be
wasting your time watching.

87
00:09:46,288 --> 00:09:47,466
Alita!

88
00:09:48,616 --> 00:09:49,998
One minute.

89
00:09:56,992 --> 00:09:58,147
Hi.

90
00:09:59,808 --> 00:10:00,959
Hello.

91
00:10:01,648 --> 00:10:02,912
You want some?

92
00:10:03,078 --> 00:10:04,287
Here you go.

93
00:10:07,497 --> 00:10:09,082
Can I hug you?

94
00:10:09,575 --> 00:10:10,711
Hi.

95
00:10:22,648 --> 00:10:27,467
WANTED
MURDER - 6 HUMAN FEMALES

96
00:10:31,644 --> 00:10:33,310
Step aside!

97
00:10:33,340 --> 00:10:35,154
Out of the way.

98
00:10:49,363 --> 00:10:50,881
Outstanding.

99
00:10:54,342 --> 00:10:56,217
Why don't you watch
where you're goin'!

100
00:10:58,952 --> 00:11:00,400
I gotta admit.

101
00:11:00,568 --> 00:11:03,716
I never saw anybody challenged
the Centurion before.

102
00:11:05,490 --> 00:11:07,275
You're heavy.

103
00:11:08,601 --> 00:11:09,842
I mean...

104
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:13,503
...you're a cyborg?

105
00:11:15,343 --> 00:11:17,670
So I was just admiring your hand.

106
00:11:18,225 --> 00:11:19,526
Can I see?

107
00:11:25,846 --> 00:11:26,916
Wow...

108
00:11:28,507 --> 00:11:30,416
It's really nice work.

109
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:33,267
Did Dr. Ido do it?

110
00:11:33,293 --> 00:11:34,911
He built off me.

111
00:11:35,318 --> 00:11:36,912
Except my core.

112
00:11:37,115 --> 00:11:39,207
- That's mine.
- Oh.

113
00:11:39,405 --> 00:11:41,275
He did a really great job.

114
00:11:43,435 --> 00:11:44,871
Hey, where are those things?

115
00:11:44,936 --> 00:11:46,270
Centurions?

116
00:11:47,913 --> 00:11:49,536
What planet do you from?

117
00:11:49,561 --> 00:11:51,560
Ido found me in Scrapyard.

118
00:11:51,692 --> 00:11:53,459
- Scrapyard?
- Hmm...

119
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:55,145
But that would mean...

120
00:11:55,610 --> 00:11:56,630
Hi, Doc.

121
00:11:56,647 --> 00:11:59,192
I've got those drive board
you're looking for.

122
00:12:00,305 --> 00:12:01,638
Alita is new in here.

123
00:12:01,663 --> 00:12:03,598
She still learning about things.

124
00:12:03,639 --> 00:12:06,138
I gotta go.
I'll drop those off later.

125
00:12:06,149 --> 00:12:08,148
I need to rebuild on a quad servo.

126
00:12:08,718 --> 00:12:10,333
Maybe I'll see you around.

127
00:12:13,968 --> 00:12:15,200
Who is that?

128
00:12:15,231 --> 00:12:16,278
Hugo.

129
00:12:17,484 --> 00:12:19,710
He's a hardworker, but...

130
00:12:20,047 --> 00:12:21,934
Alita, come on.
Let's go.

131
00:12:28,937 --> 00:12:30,731
- Hugo.
- Let's go home.

132
00:13:45,967 --> 00:13:49,467
There was a damn jackers that
ripped me to shred standing right there.

133
00:13:49,819 --> 00:13:53,386
And that Centurion
wouldn't lift a finger.

134
00:13:53,608 --> 00:13:56,239
Why would anyone wanna
take your arm and legs?

135
00:13:56,264 --> 00:13:57,956
Tourque coupling.

136
00:13:59,147 --> 00:14:02,451
Those jackers want your parts
for the black market.

137
00:14:03,061 --> 00:14:05,060
To supply the Motorball game.

138
00:14:05,078 --> 00:14:06,420
You were lucky.

139
00:14:06,515 --> 00:14:09,456
Another girl was murdered
last night right near there.

140
00:14:09,799 --> 00:14:10,849
Yeah.

141
00:14:10,943 --> 00:14:12,389
I heard
that guy...

142
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:14,669
...carves girls up and
sells their body parts.

143
00:14:14,688 --> 00:14:15,841
Shh... shh...

144
00:14:18,732 --> 00:14:20,115
Sorry, Doc.

145
00:14:20,897 --> 00:14:22,740
For now I dont want
you out after dark.

146
00:14:22,751 --> 00:14:24,740
- Is that understood?
- OK.

147
00:14:25,843 --> 00:14:27,357
And if you go out during the day,

148
00:14:27,368 --> 00:14:29,884
don't wonder too far
from this neghborhood.

149
00:14:29,895 --> 00:14:30,865
OK.

150
00:14:30,876 --> 00:14:32,757
- Promise?
- I promise.

151
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:45,148
Hey, kid!

152
00:14:59,264 --> 00:15:01,045
Hey, what's your problem?

153
00:15:15,093 --> 00:15:16,461
Who is the girl?

154
00:15:17,764 --> 00:15:19,625
My new assistant.

155
00:15:22,069 --> 00:15:24,858
I was surprised to see her
in our daughter's body.

156
00:15:25,452 --> 00:15:28,008
You're supposed to have it
destroyed that years ago.

157
00:15:30,405 --> 00:15:32,665
- I couldn't.
- Clearly.

158
00:15:34,435 --> 00:15:37,240
And did you tell her
whom you built that body for?

159
00:15:40,616 --> 00:15:42,943
Our daughter is dead, Chiren.

160
00:15:43,390 --> 00:15:45,389
You need to let it go.

161
00:15:45,537 --> 00:15:48,358
It's obviously not me that's
clinging in something here.

162
00:16:16,811 --> 00:16:18,714
- Hugo!
- Hi, Alita!

163
00:16:18,809 --> 00:16:21,946
- Is this Motorball?
- Oh, this is scrimmage.

164
00:16:22,059 --> 00:16:23,430
Do you want to join in?

165
00:16:25,358 --> 00:16:27,555
Come on,
every kid is gotta play Motorball.

166
00:16:28,921 --> 00:16:30,376
So why not.

167
00:16:31,038 --> 00:16:33,038
I want us to be a team again.

168
00:16:34,194 --> 00:16:36,071
I have a great new setup.

169
00:16:36,928 --> 00:16:38,485
And eguipment.

170
00:16:38,776 --> 00:16:40,488
Worthy of your skills.

171
00:16:41,605 --> 00:16:43,702
Together we can build
a finest champion...

172
00:16:43,713 --> 00:16:45,659
...this game
has ever seen.

173
00:16:45,873 --> 00:16:47,743
It could be my ticket home.

174
00:16:47,768 --> 00:16:50,698
When are you going to realize
there is no way back?

175
00:16:50,723 --> 00:16:52,245
It just does not happen.

176
00:16:52,271 --> 00:16:53,774
Vector can me it happen.

177
00:16:53,799 --> 00:16:55,618
I can't believe
you trust Vector.

178
00:16:55,643 --> 00:16:57,774
He has a very high connection.

179
00:16:59,827 --> 00:17:02,462
I won't help you
build monsters.

180
00:17:09,812 --> 00:17:12,047
I gotta get back to Zalem somehow.

181
00:17:13,179 --> 00:17:16,657
I'll claw my way there with
my bare hands if I have to.

182
00:17:35,482 --> 00:17:38,016
Hey everyone, this is Alita.

183
00:17:39,046 --> 00:17:39,868
Hi.

184
00:17:39,893 --> 00:17:42,158
Best way to learn is to go in.

185
00:17:57,523 --> 00:17:58,779
Pass the ball!

186
00:17:58,986 --> 00:18:00,371
That's it?

187
00:18:00,389 --> 00:18:02,794
We need you to turn
and look for an opening.

188
00:18:03,054 --> 00:18:04,733
I think i'm getting it.

189
00:18:11,248 --> 00:18:13,154
You can let go
the remote now.

190
00:18:14,879 --> 00:18:16,443
Oh, crap.

191
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:25,760
- Come on get her!
- Come on get her!

192
00:18:26,625 --> 00:18:28,744
Koyomi, pass her the ball!

193
00:18:29,526 --> 00:18:31,455
Hey, she got it.
She got it.

194
00:18:32,263 --> 00:18:33,522
Get her!

195
00:18:39,504 --> 00:18:41,220
Sorry, Princess.

196
00:18:41,740 --> 00:18:43,082
Nice, Tanji.
Thanks!

197
00:18:43,093 --> 00:18:44,918
She's never played before.

198
00:18:50,046 --> 00:18:51,191
Sorry.

199
00:19:02,831 --> 00:19:03,877
Attack him!

200
00:19:04,163 --> 00:19:05,315
Where are you?

201
00:19:30,162 --> 00:19:31,517
It's stuck.

202
00:19:36,717 --> 00:19:39,004
Your freak girlfriend's
got some serious malfunctions.

203
00:19:39,029 --> 00:19:40,693
I'm really sorry.

204
00:19:40,718 --> 00:19:42,855
She humiliated you so severely.

205
00:19:44,710 --> 00:19:46,413
Alright, I'll see you tonight.

206
00:19:46,477 --> 00:19:49,327
And ehm... she's not my girlfriend.

207
00:19:50,851 --> 00:19:52,178
Whatever.

208
00:19:58,810 --> 00:20:00,755
You got some talents
for this game.

209
00:20:01,966 --> 00:20:03,237
I gotta get home now.

210
00:20:03,263 --> 00:20:05,418
Ido wants me in the house
before dark.

211
00:20:08,530 --> 00:20:09,761
Do you wanna ride?

212
00:20:16,021 --> 00:20:17,426
You can't remember anything?

213
00:20:17,451 --> 00:20:18,779
I'm trying to.

214
00:20:18,804 --> 00:20:20,618
Family? Friend?

215
00:20:20,755 --> 00:20:21,985
Favourite food?

216
00:20:21,999 --> 00:20:23,177
Nothing.

217
00:20:23,203 --> 00:20:25,894
Well maybe orange juice.
But that's since yesterday.

218
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:27,654
- Orange juice?
- Aha.

219
00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:30,012
No. Unacceptable.

220
00:20:30,750 --> 00:20:32,293
Here, check this out.

221
00:20:38,788 --> 00:20:40,175
And here you go.

222
00:20:40,210 --> 00:20:42,146
Thank you.
You ready?

223
00:20:42,709 --> 00:20:44,090
Try this.

224
00:20:44,115 --> 00:20:45,511
Trust me.

225
00:20:46,506 --> 00:20:47,918
It's chocolate.

226
00:20:53,921 --> 00:20:56,197
- This is so great.
- It's good, right?

227
00:20:57,249 --> 00:20:59,248
I have a favourite food now.

228
00:20:59,952 --> 00:21:02,216
- This is my favourite food.
- I wouldn't call that.

229
00:21:02,241 --> 00:21:03,166
I would.

230
00:21:03,190 --> 00:21:04,303
Hey, look.

231
00:21:04,643 --> 00:21:05,936
Check it out.

232
00:21:06,067 --> 00:21:07,643
It's a Hunter Warrior.

233
00:21:07,699 --> 00:21:09,229
He's a bounty hunter.

234
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:10,680
The name is Zapan.

235
00:21:10,928 --> 00:21:12,695
Scanning for his mark.

236
00:21:14,451 --> 00:21:16,430
I would'nt want to be that guy.

237
00:21:17,991 --> 00:21:20,038
Look at that sword.

238
00:21:20,428 --> 00:21:22,853
All guns are outlawed
in Iron City.

239
00:21:23,569 --> 00:21:25,374
Punishable by dead.

240
00:21:27,523 --> 00:21:29,730
Anything that challenge to Zalem.

241
00:21:54,335 --> 00:21:57,152
Didn't I tell you to be home
before dark?

242
00:21:57,336 --> 00:21:58,684
What's the big deal?

243
00:21:58,709 --> 00:22:00,496
I just lost track of time.

244
00:22:01,788 --> 00:22:03,592
Don't trust anyone.

245
00:22:04,155 --> 00:22:06,449
People do terrible things
to each other here.

246
00:22:07,733 --> 00:22:09,254
What happened to your arm?

247
00:22:09,279 --> 00:22:10,965
Here. Eat this.

248
00:22:10,990 --> 00:22:12,575
Are you OK?

249
00:22:17,858 --> 00:22:20,865
You still need a proper nourishment
for your brain.

250
00:22:23,773 --> 00:22:25,418
Do you have any chocolate?

251
00:22:29,896 --> 00:22:31,529
Its a harsh world.

252
00:22:31,609 --> 00:22:33,975
The strong prey
on the weak down here.

253
00:22:34,483 --> 00:22:36,527
You gotta stay focus
on your dream.

254
00:22:37,553 --> 00:22:39,093
What's your dream?

255
00:22:39,274 --> 00:22:40,811
I'll show you.

256
00:23:00,382 --> 00:23:02,124
This is my secret place.

257
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:05,562
Best view in town.

258
00:23:11,967 --> 00:23:13,475
Really cool.

259
00:23:13,540 --> 00:23:15,539
No. Look.

260
00:23:16,350 --> 00:23:17,734
That view.

261
00:23:20,585 --> 00:23:21,772
Right.

262
00:23:27,695 --> 00:23:29,819
I wonder what is like up there.

263
00:23:32,123 --> 00:23:34,273
Better than this dump down here.

264
00:23:36,968 --> 00:23:38,194
Listen.

265
00:23:41,163 --> 00:23:44,194
Stuff from the Factory
going up to Zalem.

266
00:23:46,882 --> 00:23:49,740
The tube is just for cargo.
Not for the people.

267
00:23:50,429 --> 00:23:51,929
If I were as strong as you,

268
00:23:51,947 --> 00:23:54,153
I'd climb that tube to Zalem
right now.

269
00:23:54,185 --> 00:23:56,026
But they don't let anyboy up there.

270
00:23:56,037 --> 00:23:57,996
No. That's what they want
you to think.

271
00:23:58,303 --> 00:24:00,302
You just gotta know
the right people.

272
00:24:00,476 --> 00:24:02,709
- I happen to be connected.
- Oh...

273
00:24:06,015 --> 00:24:08,532
You gotta willing to do
what it takes.

274
00:24:10,883 --> 00:24:12,460
Whatever it takes.

275
00:24:15,522 --> 00:24:17,600
Funny thing is you've seen it.

276
00:24:18,257 --> 00:24:19,983
You just can't remember.

277
00:24:20,524 --> 00:24:21,967
What do you mean?

278
00:24:24,568 --> 00:24:26,553
Doc found you in Scrapyard.

279
00:24:28,054 --> 00:24:30,726
All that stuff is dumped from Zalem.

280
00:24:31,687 --> 00:24:34,038
So you must be from up there.

281
00:24:39,069 --> 00:24:40,717
I guess so.

282
00:24:41,897 --> 00:24:44,232
If you could just tell me
what those eyes have seen.

283
00:24:44,265 --> 00:24:45,600
I wish I could.

284
00:24:45,994 --> 00:24:48,290
I keep trying to remember but...

285
00:24:48,819 --> 00:24:50,225
...it's still a blink.

286
00:24:51,865 --> 00:24:54,568
Starting to feel like
I wasn't very important.

287
00:24:55,538 --> 00:24:59,055
Just an insignificant girl thrown out
with the rest of the garbage.

288
00:26:41,247 --> 00:26:42,275
No! Stop!

289
00:26:42,286 --> 00:26:43,041
Alita!

290
00:26:43,052 --> 00:26:44,490
Don't do it!

291
00:26:45,076 --> 00:26:46,247
Oh, no.

292
00:26:46,890 --> 00:26:48,122
It's a trap.

293
00:26:48,282 --> 00:26:49,803
Looking for me...

294
00:26:50,236 --> 00:26:51,445
...Doctor?

295
00:26:52,131 --> 00:26:53,748
Or should I say...

296
00:26:53,759 --> 00:26:55,298
...Hunter Warrior?

297
00:26:56,683 --> 00:26:58,259
Hunter Warrior?

298
00:27:02,460 --> 00:27:04,017
Oh no...

299
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:07,282
Looks like he's got us.

300
00:27:09,592 --> 00:27:10,906
Don't move!

301
00:27:12,281 --> 00:27:14,788
Hey, thanks for bringing the girl.

302
00:27:14,813 --> 00:27:16,967
That's gonna save us some time.

303
00:27:30,335 --> 00:27:31,937
Nice shot!

304
00:27:32,635 --> 00:27:34,290
For a meat boy.

305
00:27:44,737 --> 00:27:45,999
No!

306
00:27:47,484 --> 00:27:49,852
You came to rescue me?

307
00:27:50,445 --> 00:27:53,086
That is so sweet.

308
00:27:55,766 --> 00:27:57,547
You have nice eyes.

309
00:27:57,572 --> 00:27:59,142
He's mine.

310
00:27:59,167 --> 00:28:01,146
You can have the girl.

311
00:28:03,538 --> 00:28:05,537
So long as I get his eyes.

312
00:28:05,562 --> 00:28:06,867
Alita run!

313
00:28:35,260 --> 00:28:36,900
Watch her die.

314
00:29:20,375 --> 00:29:22,267
Come here, little flea.

315
00:29:22,717 --> 00:29:25,006
So I can pich your head off.

316
00:29:52,175 --> 00:29:54,614
99, on your left!

317
00:30:14,416 --> 00:30:16,554
You'll pay, little flea.

318
00:30:16,854 --> 00:30:19,298
Grewhiska does not forget.

319
00:30:19,697 --> 00:30:21,276
I'll coming for you.

320
00:30:23,916 --> 00:30:25,063
Both.

321
00:30:33,140 --> 00:30:35,384
Grewhiska does not forget!

322
00:30:39,135 --> 00:30:41,641
When I was fighting,
i remembered something.

323
00:30:41,893 --> 00:30:43,955
I was in a huge battle.

324
00:30:43,972 --> 00:30:45,722
You surprise me.

325
00:30:45,940 --> 00:30:47,807
Well you've surprised me too.

326
00:30:48,986 --> 00:30:50,758
Before The Fall,

327
00:30:50,817 --> 00:30:53,738
there were police to stop criminals.

328
00:30:54,494 --> 00:30:58,230
Now the Factory pays us
to do their dirty work.

329
00:30:59,228 --> 00:31:02,634
Hunter Warrior 17739

330
00:31:03,072 --> 00:31:05,111
You are a Hunter Warrior.

331
00:31:09,470 --> 00:31:10,650
Stay here.

332
00:31:11,620 --> 00:31:13,320
Don't kill anyone.

333
00:31:43,900 --> 00:31:47,463
Bounty from Cyborg Nyssiana
was 20.000 credit.

334
00:31:51,814 --> 00:31:53,813
You should've told me
who you really are.

335
00:31:54,097 --> 00:31:55,763
Do you do it for the money?

336
00:31:56,143 --> 00:31:57,818
I take the money.

337
00:31:58,494 --> 00:32:01,379
Otherwise the clinic
would've closed long ago.

338
00:32:01,580 --> 00:32:04,314
I do this work for other reason
I rather not talk about it.

339
00:32:04,331 --> 00:32:06,330
You have to talk about it!

340
00:32:06,363 --> 00:32:08,808
Something during the fight
triggered the memory.

341
00:32:09,432 --> 00:32:11,299
I was on the Moon.

342
00:32:11,963 --> 00:32:14,517
You know more about me
than you're saying.

343
00:32:15,502 --> 00:32:17,196
Whose body is this?

344
00:32:18,713 --> 00:32:20,040
Who am i?

345
00:32:30,119 --> 00:32:31,752
This was your daughter.

346
00:32:35,658 --> 00:32:37,713
You built this body for her.

347
00:32:38,783 --> 00:32:40,541
Her name was Alita.

348
00:32:41,057 --> 00:32:44,571
She was really looking forward
to waking up with legs that could run.

349
00:32:48,462 --> 00:32:50,978
You built her a pair of fast legs.

350
00:32:53,424 --> 00:32:55,667
She never got to use them.

351
00:32:56,750 --> 00:32:58,219
She was murdered.

352
00:33:00,322 --> 00:33:01,579
What happened?

353
00:33:03,385 --> 00:33:07,213
A patient of mine came to the clinic
one night looking for drugs.

354
00:33:08,828 --> 00:33:11,345
I was a tuner for
the Motorball games.

355
00:33:11,361 --> 00:33:16,007
And I made a machine body
for him of obscene strength.

356
00:33:19,501 --> 00:33:22,354
He was my demon doing back to me.

357
00:33:22,658 --> 00:33:23,702
Hey!

358
00:33:23,971 --> 00:33:25,735
What are you doing there?

359
00:33:38,877 --> 00:33:41,470
Alita couldn't get out of
her way fast enough.

360
00:33:43,314 --> 00:33:45,395
Her mother, Chiren,

361
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:47,988
could'nt deal with Alita's death.

362
00:33:50,721 --> 00:33:53,158
Maybe she just couldn't deal with me.

363
00:33:56,166 --> 00:33:58,322
So I went hunting.

364
00:33:59,986 --> 00:34:02,174
I needed to kill him.

365
00:34:03,969 --> 00:34:06,888
Maybe I was just hoping
that he would kill me.

366
00:34:07,101 --> 00:34:09,022
It brought no peace.

367
00:34:09,299 --> 00:34:11,636
There were other demons
like him out there.

368
00:34:11,661 --> 00:34:15,661
I felt somehow I was responsible
for all of them.

369
00:34:16,753 --> 00:34:19,164
So I registered
as a Hunter Warrior.

370
00:34:19,189 --> 00:34:21,112
Nothing noble about it.

371
00:34:23,220 --> 00:34:25,220
Did you ever find peace?

372
00:34:27,581 --> 00:34:29,136
I found you.

373
00:34:31,377 --> 00:34:32,900
I'm not your daughter.

374
00:34:35,792 --> 00:34:37,557
I don't know what I am.

375
00:34:38,587 --> 00:34:39,813
I do.

376
00:34:40,737 --> 00:34:43,268
Have a look at your original
cyber core.

377
00:34:44,612 --> 00:34:46,438
This your brain.

378
00:34:46,588 --> 00:34:50,065
A normal,
healthy teenage girl's brain.

379
00:34:50,556 --> 00:34:52,323
If there is such a thing.

380
00:34:53,893 --> 00:34:55,839
But this is your heart.

381
00:34:55,964 --> 00:34:58,175
Heart of your original core.

382
00:34:58,698 --> 00:35:02,213
Powered by
an anti-matter micro reactor.

383
00:35:02,604 --> 00:35:04,408
So i've got a strong heart.

384
00:35:05,502 --> 00:35:10,073
You have a heart strong enough
to power all of Iron City for years.

385
00:35:11,681 --> 00:35:13,635
This is lost technology.

386
00:35:13,661 --> 00:35:16,097
Nobody made this stuff since...

387
00:35:17,057 --> 00:35:18,915
...before The Fall.

388
00:35:18,940 --> 00:35:20,519
Yeah right.

389
00:35:21,002 --> 00:35:23,127
So i'm 300 years old?

390
00:35:23,807 --> 00:35:25,814
Sweetheart, you are.

391
00:35:42,971 --> 00:35:46,151
I dont want my players loosing
unless I tell them to.

392
00:35:46,924 --> 00:35:48,759
I can't be left the chance.

393
00:35:49,580 --> 00:35:51,292
You promised me champions.

394
00:35:51,317 --> 00:35:53,737
And you promised me
the best of everything.

395
00:35:54,298 --> 00:35:56,900
Get those military servos
I've asked for.

396
00:35:56,925 --> 00:35:58,924
You don't have a winning attitude.

397
00:35:59,690 --> 00:36:02,081
Just be ready for tomorrow's game.

398
00:36:25,298 --> 00:36:26,581
Help.

399
00:36:26,761 --> 00:36:27,839
Help me.

400
00:36:27,864 --> 00:36:29,089
Grewishka?

401
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:32,810
Why should I waste my talent on you?

402
00:36:32,838 --> 00:36:35,036
Look what she's done to me.

403
00:36:35,940 --> 00:36:38,708
Ido's little cyber girl.

404
00:36:42,276 --> 00:36:43,807
What did you say?

405
00:36:48,025 --> 00:36:51,578
The woman in my memory,
called me 99.

406
00:36:52,683 --> 00:36:56,745
What you saw is a flash
of your previous lifes.

407
00:36:57,127 --> 00:36:58,415
Who was I?

408
00:36:58,807 --> 00:37:00,900
In time you'll remember.

409
00:37:45,619 --> 00:37:47,618
I want to rip her in half.

410
00:37:48,080 --> 00:37:49,309
Grewishka.

411
00:37:50,861 --> 00:37:53,050
Oh, how the mighty have fallen.

412
00:37:54,479 --> 00:37:56,231
I wish stripping him for parts.

413
00:37:56,256 --> 00:37:58,256
I need you to look at something.

414
00:38:01,479 --> 00:38:03,956
It's a TelePresence chip.
He's wired.

415
00:38:04,074 --> 00:38:06,168
Somebody in Zalem is riding him.

416
00:38:06,193 --> 00:38:09,262
There are watchers behind
the eyes all over the city.

417
00:38:09,393 --> 00:38:10,549
Pretty common now.

418
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:12,158
I'd just as soon remove it...

419
00:38:12,728 --> 00:38:14,225
...while I'm rebuilding him.

420
00:38:14,267 --> 00:38:17,208
Why are you wasting time
on this burned-out street junk?

421
00:38:17,324 --> 00:38:18,910
It's a personal matter.

422
00:38:18,935 --> 00:38:21,801
Do you like your job, Vector?

423
00:38:22,502 --> 00:38:24,331
If you like your position...

424
00:38:24,342 --> 00:38:26,561
...and the many
comforts come with it,

425
00:38:26,576 --> 00:38:30,137
I strongly suggest
you listen to Dr. Chiren.

426
00:38:32,495 --> 00:38:33,660
Nova.

427
00:38:35,073 --> 00:38:36,636
My apologies.

428
00:38:37,149 --> 00:38:39,416
Who did this to Grewishka?

429
00:38:39,623 --> 00:38:41,497
A little cyborg girl.

430
00:38:42,456 --> 00:38:45,723
Though the impact points are evidence
of an extraordinary power.

431
00:38:47,143 --> 00:38:51,020
I don't understand how she can create
such force on a such small body.

432
00:38:51,518 --> 00:38:54,914
It was not the power
of the body that did this.

433
00:38:54,927 --> 00:38:56,325
It was the mind.

434
00:38:56,350 --> 00:38:58,512
She knows the fighting techniques.

435
00:38:58,622 --> 00:39:00,426
A Panzer Kunst.

436
00:39:00,506 --> 00:39:02,325
Rebuild Grewishka.

437
00:39:02,350 --> 00:39:04,622
Have him bring her to me.

438
00:39:04,977 --> 00:39:06,168
Dead.

439
00:39:14,852 --> 00:39:16,114
He's gone.

440
00:39:17,221 --> 00:39:18,644
Not gone.

441
00:39:20,049 --> 00:39:21,653
Re-patched.

442
00:39:23,096 --> 00:39:25,137
You are a clever woman, Doctor.

443
00:39:27,174 --> 00:39:30,507
And determine to reach your goal
at any cost.

444
00:39:32,956 --> 00:39:34,801
So I make you this over.

445
00:39:35,591 --> 00:39:37,871
If and when you've pleased me,

446
00:39:38,556 --> 00:39:41,333
I will grant you
the destiny you seek.

447
00:39:41,868 --> 00:39:43,086
Zalem.

448
00:39:44,930 --> 00:39:46,606
You'll send me to Zalem?

449
00:39:46,631 --> 00:39:48,317
I'm there right now.

450
00:39:49,932 --> 00:39:52,520
Consider my service is engaged.

451
00:40:12,658 --> 00:40:14,770
There is no bounty on Grewishka.

452
00:40:14,795 --> 00:40:16,764
You report it to the Factory.

453
00:40:17,561 --> 00:40:19,309
He's killing all those women.

454
00:40:19,334 --> 00:40:21,036
Somebody is protecting him.

455
00:40:21,146 --> 00:40:23,146
Who has power to do that?

456
00:40:24,744 --> 00:40:27,620
Someone far beyond us here.

457
00:40:29,375 --> 00:40:31,868
We'll better stay off
the street from now.

458
00:40:33,244 --> 00:40:35,743
I wanna be
a Hunter Warrior like you.

459
00:40:36,184 --> 00:40:37,748
Alita, that's impossible.

460
00:40:37,772 --> 00:40:39,274
We could be a team.

461
00:40:39,379 --> 00:40:41,176
Alita, this is dangerous.
A dirty work.

462
00:40:41,201 --> 00:40:42,770
- I know.
- No, you don't.

463
00:40:42,940 --> 00:40:45,024
How's that your choice to make?

464
00:40:45,291 --> 00:40:46,458
It's out of a question.

465
00:40:46,483 --> 00:40:49,853
I might need a life or dead situation
to remember who I was.

466
00:40:49,878 --> 00:40:51,438
Even if it's just for a second.

467
00:40:51,462 --> 00:40:53,727
Alita, somethings are
better left forgotten.

468
00:40:53,862 --> 00:40:56,518
I don't want blood
on these hands too.

469
00:40:56,985 --> 00:40:58,791
And I'll find out for myself.

470
00:40:59,247 --> 00:41:00,376
Alita!

471
00:41:05,611 --> 00:41:07,423
I'm just tired of it.

472
00:41:07,605 --> 00:41:10,079
He just wants me to be
his perfect little girl.

473
00:41:10,104 --> 00:41:12,908
So are you gonna live
by his rules or yours?

474
00:41:17,378 --> 00:41:19,284
Welcome to Motorball!

475
00:41:25,461 --> 00:41:27,770
Joshugan is got the ball.

476
00:41:29,733 --> 00:41:31,465
Claymore attacks!

477
00:41:33,487 --> 00:41:35,257
Joshugan takes him out!

478
00:42:10,749 --> 00:42:13,976
And he throws Ajakutty
like a rag doll!

479
00:42:22,534 --> 00:42:24,534
Come on,
let me show you something.

480
00:42:28,705 --> 00:42:30,379
I know all the pit crews and tuners.

481
00:42:30,404 --> 00:42:32,012
I'll introduce you around.

482
00:42:33,745 --> 00:42:35,372
Who's the top player?

483
00:42:38,061 --> 00:42:41,255
Right now I'd say Joshugan has
the best chance to make to final champion.

484
00:42:43,877 --> 00:42:45,876
I was over-steering in turn sixth.

485
00:42:46,384 --> 00:42:48,025
What's final champion?

486
00:42:48,051 --> 00:42:50,368
It's the best thing
a Motorball player can win.

487
00:42:50,653 --> 00:42:53,455
Every few years they choose
a player that can be beaten.

488
00:42:53,712 --> 00:42:55,583
And he gets to go to Zalem.

489
00:43:01,269 --> 00:43:03,598
Juggernaut needs to pit right now.

490
00:43:04,145 --> 00:43:05,606
Do you like to loose?

491
00:43:05,853 --> 00:43:07,853
Then get him here.

492
00:43:09,385 --> 00:43:12,192
Claymore is rebuilt.
Why is he not tracking?

493
00:43:15,274 --> 00:43:16,699
Alita is here.

494
00:43:16,724 --> 00:43:18,074
That's Vector.

495
00:43:18,520 --> 00:43:20,225
He basically runs Motorball.

496
00:43:20,323 --> 00:43:22,251
We do a lot of business with his team.

497
00:43:22,277 --> 00:43:24,157
Selling parts to him and his new tuner.

498
00:43:24,182 --> 00:43:25,269
Chiren.

499
00:43:26,893 --> 00:43:29,158
What? You're not the only one
with connection.

500
00:43:30,518 --> 00:43:32,863
Getting close to Juggernaut.

501
00:43:34,952 --> 00:43:37,228
Kinuba had cutting in his side.

502
00:43:49,581 --> 00:43:53,689
Kinuba went through him like laundry
with those Grind Cutters.

503
00:43:54,090 --> 00:43:55,686
Is that weapon even legal?

504
00:44:00,212 --> 00:44:02,079
Kinuba is too strong
with that new weapon.

505
00:44:02,104 --> 00:44:03,720
He's goin' up the odds.

506
00:44:04,869 --> 00:44:06,055
You know...

507
00:44:06,845 --> 00:44:09,423
...I could really use his Grind Cutters.

508
00:44:10,042 --> 00:44:11,798
For other project.

509
00:44:17,166 --> 00:44:18,696
What do you think?

510
00:44:21,625 --> 00:44:22,968
I like it.

511
00:44:25,156 --> 00:44:27,055
Hey Hugo,
we gotta go.

512
00:44:27,141 --> 00:44:28,715
Hey, something came up.

513
00:44:28,892 --> 00:44:30,838
- Where are you going?
- I just got to do something.

514
00:44:30,993 --> 00:44:32,872
Can you get back OK?

515
00:44:33,369 --> 00:44:34,657
Yes, sure.

516
00:44:35,870 --> 00:44:37,598
Can you go out tomorrow?

517
00:44:38,087 --> 00:44:39,868
I wanna show you this
place me and Tanji knows.

518
00:44:39,879 --> 00:44:41,311
It's out in the Badlands.

519
00:44:41,326 --> 00:44:42,990
It might helps with your memory.

520
00:44:43,830 --> 00:44:45,404
I appreciate that.

521
00:44:45,823 --> 00:44:47,071
Thanks.

522
00:44:47,353 --> 00:44:48,977
For everything.

523
00:45:07,337 --> 00:45:08,829
What the hell?

524
00:45:26,916 --> 00:45:28,084
Hurry up!

525
00:45:32,056 --> 00:45:33,584
You are dead!

526
00:45:35,619 --> 00:45:37,053
You little runts!

527
00:45:37,437 --> 00:45:39,231
I'm gonna smash your skulls!

528
00:45:52,627 --> 00:45:54,025
You strip parts!

529
00:45:54,036 --> 00:45:55,816
I'm gonna make you pay for this.

530
00:46:19,962 --> 00:46:21,348
Nice works.

531
00:46:22,455 --> 00:46:24,454
Compliments to your crew.

532
00:46:25,033 --> 00:46:26,492
Thank you, Sir.

533
00:46:30,041 --> 00:46:31,374
Pass it on.

534
00:46:31,698 --> 00:46:33,369
Hey man, where is my cut?

535
00:46:34,314 --> 00:46:36,432
When you gonna tell your
little hardbody you jack cyborg?

536
00:46:36,457 --> 00:46:37,810
I'm not.

537
00:46:38,066 --> 00:46:39,441
Neither are you.

538
00:46:39,466 --> 00:46:41,594
Are you afraid
she's gonna cut you loose?

539
00:46:49,737 --> 00:46:52,017
Get the Grind Cutters over
to Chiren right away.

540
00:46:52,088 --> 00:46:54,743
Use the service gate.

541
00:46:55,558 --> 00:46:56,741
Go.

542
00:47:10,455 --> 00:47:12,237
Vector, you prick!

543
00:47:12,262 --> 00:47:13,766
I should've known.

544
00:47:14,065 --> 00:47:16,335
Well you should've known, my friend...

545
00:47:16,752 --> 00:47:18,342
...is that no one...

546
00:47:20,260 --> 00:47:22,361
...is greater than a game.

547
00:47:43,252 --> 00:47:45,033
What's outside the city?

548
00:47:45,337 --> 00:47:46,478
Not much.

549
00:47:46,503 --> 00:47:49,300
War wiped out all utilities
and most everything else.

550
00:47:53,276 --> 00:47:54,703
All we know...

551
00:47:54,785 --> 00:47:57,215
...is the Sky City fell all in one night.

552
00:47:57,487 --> 00:47:59,807
When the enemy
launched the last attack...

553
00:47:59,818 --> 00:48:01,526
...with every ship they had.

554
00:48:02,143 --> 00:48:03,689
Who was the enemy?

555
00:48:04,213 --> 00:48:05,799
The URM.

556
00:48:06,065 --> 00:48:08,196
United Republic of Mars.

557
00:48:08,221 --> 00:48:10,385
You are URM.

558
00:48:10,396 --> 00:48:11,428
URM.

559
00:48:11,457 --> 00:48:13,549
On that last night of the war,

560
00:48:14,089 --> 00:48:16,408
there's silk in the sky burned.

561
00:48:17,025 --> 00:48:19,923
And in the morning,
Zalem stills stood.

562
00:48:20,501 --> 00:48:22,157
It's just up ahead.

563
00:48:29,805 --> 00:48:32,041
This ship is from the battle of Zalem.

564
00:48:32,462 --> 00:48:35,440
I'd figure that maybe things up from the war
would help trigger memory...

565
00:48:43,970 --> 00:48:47,040
Salvagers have jacked some stuff
over the years for metal.

566
00:48:47,328 --> 00:48:50,045
But it's all URM's technology
so small should've been left alone.

567
00:48:50,070 --> 00:48:52,099
- This is an URM ship?
- Hmm...

568
00:48:52,140 --> 00:48:55,363
You know it's pretty hard to sell the stuff
since no one knows what it is or what...

569
00:48:55,374 --> 00:48:56,426
Shh...

570
00:49:05,151 --> 00:49:07,110
We have to go to the command deck.

571
00:49:09,025 --> 00:49:10,383
It's forward.

572
00:49:11,160 --> 00:49:12,798
How did she know that?

573
00:49:12,861 --> 00:49:15,861
Hey, we can't get there.
It's under water.

574
00:49:48,549 --> 00:49:50,716
How long do you think
she can hold her breath?

575
00:49:51,830 --> 00:49:53,066
I don't know.

576
00:51:39,121 --> 00:51:40,986
Oh... this can't be good.

577
00:52:06,104 --> 00:52:08,393
Forget it.
I won't do it.

578
00:52:09,058 --> 00:52:10,058
But...

579
00:52:10,870 --> 00:52:12,455
...but you have to.

580
00:52:13,307 --> 00:52:17,049
This would help us fight Grewishka
and anyone else he sends after us.

581
00:52:18,713 --> 00:52:20,126
This body...

582
00:52:20,994 --> 00:52:23,361
...it has the power I need.

583
00:52:23,635 --> 00:52:26,283
I feel a connection to it.
I can't explain.

584
00:52:26,885 --> 00:52:28,369
This could be who I am.

585
00:52:28,394 --> 00:52:30,565
You've been given
a chance to start over.

586
00:52:30,576 --> 00:52:31,830
With a clean slate.

587
00:52:31,845 --> 00:52:33,548
How many of us get that?

588
00:52:33,573 --> 00:52:35,931
Why did an enemy warship...

589
00:52:37,221 --> 00:52:38,923
...respond to me?

590
00:52:39,516 --> 00:52:41,321
Because I knew that ship!

591
00:52:41,815 --> 00:52:44,087
I've been on others like it, haven't i?

592
00:52:45,339 --> 00:52:46,666
Haven't I?

593
00:52:46,677 --> 00:52:49,879
Whatever you were,
is not who and you are now.

594
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:51,420
Enough!

595
00:52:53,556 --> 00:52:55,572
I'm a warrior, aren't I?

596
00:52:56,978 --> 00:52:58,399
And you know.

597
00:52:59,298 --> 00:53:01,009
You've always known.

598
00:53:06,534 --> 00:53:08,345
This is called a Berserker.

599
00:53:10,135 --> 00:53:14,069
It's a humanoid weapon system
created by the URM Technarchy.

600
00:53:14,956 --> 00:53:18,946
Your core was designed to
interface with this type of body.

601
00:53:19,955 --> 00:53:22,842
Your identity code activated it.

602
00:53:23,072 --> 00:53:26,123
The instinctive fighting technique you use...

603
00:53:27,088 --> 00:53:29,103
...is Panzer Kunst.

604
00:53:29,414 --> 00:53:32,172
A lost combat art for machine bodies...

605
00:53:32,183 --> 00:53:34,236
...it was used by the Berserkers.

606
00:53:35,049 --> 00:53:38,350
This is why you're drawn to conflict
without hesitation.

607
00:53:38,737 --> 00:53:40,532
It's part of your training.

608
00:53:40,909 --> 00:53:44,017
You are not just a warrior, Alita.

609
00:53:45,752 --> 00:53:47,705
You an URM Berserker.

610
00:53:47,730 --> 00:53:51,796
The most advanced cyborg weapon
ever created.

611
00:53:52,292 --> 00:53:56,626
And that is exactly why
I will never unite you with this body.

612
00:54:00,995 --> 00:54:02,446
That's fine.

613
00:54:04,152 --> 00:54:05,267
Fine.

614
00:54:33,589 --> 00:54:35,354
State your business!

615
00:54:35,590 --> 00:54:38,073
I'm here to register
as a Hunter Warrior.

616
00:54:44,886 --> 00:54:46,339
How did it go?

617
00:54:50,979 --> 00:54:52,978
You're a Hunter Warrior alright.

618
00:54:53,158 --> 00:54:54,393
Doc is gonna be pissed.

619
00:54:54,417 --> 00:54:56,478
Whose rules do I live by?

620
00:55:04,894 --> 00:55:07,604
Are you sure about this?
This place is just for bounty hunter. Nobody else...

621
00:55:07,629 --> 00:55:08,978
What do you think this is?

622
00:55:09,003 --> 00:55:12,361
Beside,
Ido says I'm drawn to conflict.

623
00:55:15,149 --> 00:55:16,688
I remember you.

624
00:55:17,088 --> 00:55:19,088
How is it going?
Are you OK?

625
00:55:19,352 --> 00:55:20,392
Hello?

626
00:55:23,096 --> 00:55:24,712
Just watch my back.

627
00:55:26,073 --> 00:55:27,505
Oh boy...

628
00:55:44,376 --> 00:55:45,819
Hey, Zapan!

629
00:55:46,005 --> 00:55:47,753
Not the furniture.

630
00:55:57,010 --> 00:55:59,009
What brings you in here, sweet?

631
00:55:59,878 --> 00:56:01,753
Come to see the hunter up close?

632
00:56:01,778 --> 00:56:03,077
Not exactly.

633
00:56:11,159 --> 00:56:13,186
Cupcake is a bounty hunter.

634
00:56:16,245 --> 00:56:18,388
So you went down,

635
00:56:18,399 --> 00:56:20,412
threw that your application form,

636
00:56:20,427 --> 00:56:22,162
You got your ID badge in.

637
00:56:22,173 --> 00:56:24,056
And now you're just like us, ya?

638
00:56:25,486 --> 00:56:28,432
Let me introduce you
to some of your professional colleagues.

639
00:56:29,917 --> 00:56:32,581
This is Master Clive Lee
of the White Hot Palm.

640
00:56:32,964 --> 00:56:35,683
He has over 200 confirmed kills.

641
00:56:36,252 --> 00:56:37,527
207.

642
00:56:38,213 --> 00:56:39,768
And this is Screwhead.

643
00:56:39,926 --> 00:56:42,558
One of our most lethal bounty hunters.

644
00:56:43,706 --> 00:56:45,581
And then there's McTeague.

645
00:56:46,477 --> 00:56:49,535
The dog master.
With his hellhounds.

646
00:56:49,884 --> 00:56:51,784
His biggest problem is there
is never enough left...

647
00:56:51,795 --> 00:56:54,350
...to identify off this we
can collect the bounty.

648
00:56:58,667 --> 00:57:00,418
Then there is me.

649
00:57:01,088 --> 00:57:02,403
Zapan.

650
00:57:03,058 --> 00:57:05,502
Keeper of the legendary
Damascus blade.

651
00:57:07,798 --> 00:57:09,550
Honed to mono-moleculer edge.

652
00:57:09,561 --> 00:57:11,856
Its slices armour like butter.

653
00:57:13,055 --> 00:57:16,432
Forged before The Fall
by the lost art of URM metallurgy.

654
00:57:16,552 --> 00:57:18,673
And who did you kill to acquire it?

655
00:57:22,940 --> 00:57:26,860
Hunter Warrior is a solitary predator.

656
00:57:27,972 --> 00:57:30,542
You'll be competing against us
for the kill.

657
00:57:30,981 --> 00:57:33,096
You can see
what you're up against.

658
00:57:37,406 --> 00:57:38,643
Thanks.

659
00:57:41,635 --> 00:57:43,909
I came to ask for your help.

660
00:57:44,425 --> 00:57:47,301
Against our common enemy, Grewishka.

661
00:57:48,307 --> 00:57:50,294
He's being protected by the system...

662
00:57:50,305 --> 00:57:52,989
...and continue to rampage unchecked.

663
00:57:53,994 --> 00:57:56,079
And now he's after Ido and me.

664
00:57:56,690 --> 00:57:58,751
So I'm calling on you...

665
00:57:59,308 --> 00:58:01,308
...my Hunter Warrior brothers.

666
00:58:02,448 --> 00:58:04,174
Let's band together.

667
00:58:04,565 --> 00:58:07,565
And defeat him once and for all.

668
00:58:15,322 --> 00:58:17,072
Any takers?
Hmm..?

669
00:58:18,026 --> 00:58:19,214
No?

670
00:58:20,222 --> 00:58:21,689
Big surprise.

671
00:58:23,080 --> 00:58:25,751
You know normally I wouldn't take care
over you under my wing.

672
00:58:26,799 --> 00:58:28,283
Share my knowledge.

673
00:58:28,661 --> 00:58:31,040
Well I'm gonna make
an exception in your case.

674
00:58:31,533 --> 00:58:34,347
If you cut loose meat boy over there
and let me buy you a drink.

675
00:58:34,372 --> 00:58:35,767
Hey, watch it!

676
00:58:37,932 --> 00:58:40,768
And what could I learn from
a loudmouth pretty boy...

677
00:58:40,793 --> 00:58:43,642
...who spend all of his money on his face?

678
00:58:48,886 --> 00:58:51,058
Maybe I'll pull your arms and legs off.

679
00:58:51,440 --> 00:58:53,476
Throw your head around in the street.

680
00:58:54,057 --> 00:58:56,554
Maybe that will teach you some manners.

681
00:58:57,729 --> 00:58:59,375
You might mess up your hair.

682
00:59:32,384 --> 00:59:34,384
You do not deeserve such a weapon.

683
00:59:37,096 --> 00:59:39,856
I heard you are the hero of Iron City.

684
00:59:41,455 --> 00:59:43,129
I am not impressed.

685
00:59:43,620 --> 00:59:45,048
What the hell are you doing?

686
00:59:45,074 --> 00:59:47,213
I'm gonna need you sit way back.

687
00:59:50,104 --> 00:59:52,574
I will take on anyone in this room.

688
00:59:53,432 --> 00:59:54,824
And if I win,

689
00:59:55,704 --> 00:59:57,704
You fight alongside me.

690
01:00:00,307 --> 01:00:02,220
This bitch break my nose.

691
01:00:02,245 --> 01:00:03,626
Yes, I did.

692
01:00:05,543 --> 01:00:06,715
Heroes?

693
01:00:06,740 --> 01:00:09,824
All I see is junkyard punks, assorted cyber trash...

694
01:00:09,835 --> 01:00:13,550
...and bunch of drunken Motorball
burn-outs too slow to play the game.

695
01:00:55,470 --> 01:00:56,855
Thanks, Hugo.

696
01:01:08,581 --> 01:01:09,747
Oh, no.

697
01:01:23,200 --> 01:01:24,488
Hold it!

698
01:01:25,845 --> 01:01:27,278
Knock it off!

699
01:01:28,283 --> 01:01:30,627
Or no more free repairs!

700
01:01:41,447 --> 01:01:42,862
I'm with her.

701
01:01:43,038 --> 01:01:44,818
Sorry about this.

702
01:01:47,738 --> 01:01:49,545
You and I are going to have
a little talk.

703
01:01:49,570 --> 01:01:51,381
No. We've had our talk.

704
01:01:51,409 --> 01:01:53,130
You didn't leave another choice.

705
01:02:12,002 --> 01:02:13,414
Dont move.

706
01:02:25,057 --> 01:02:26,603
It's Grewishka.

707
01:02:26,628 --> 01:02:28,307
What's happened to him?

708
01:02:29,534 --> 01:02:31,534
Well to answer your question...

709
01:02:37,025 --> 01:02:39,025
...I've had a little up-grade.

710
01:02:48,782 --> 01:02:50,836
I'm only here for the girl.

711
01:02:52,956 --> 01:02:54,601
Now she's all yours.

712
01:02:58,994 --> 01:03:00,562
What about the rest of you?

713
01:03:00,610 --> 01:03:02,610
There is no bounty on this guy, Dok.

714
01:03:03,882 --> 01:03:05,335
Not our problem.

715
01:03:11,485 --> 01:03:12,865
It's alright, Ido.

716
01:03:20,932 --> 01:03:23,164
The only one with courage.

717
01:03:25,354 --> 01:03:26,914
So innocent.

718
01:03:34,026 --> 01:03:38,766
Iron City is no place
for an innocent, little flea.

719
01:03:48,759 --> 01:03:52,451
I do not stand by in the presence of evil.

720
01:03:56,010 --> 01:03:59,695
I do not stand by in the presence of evil.

721
01:04:17,189 --> 01:04:19,142
Come to my world.

722
01:04:23,251 --> 01:04:25,077
Come, little flea!

723
01:04:25,244 --> 01:04:26,494
Alita!

724
01:04:26,519 --> 01:04:27,720
No!

725
01:04:35,752 --> 01:04:37,549
Welcome to the underworld.

726
01:04:37,574 --> 01:04:38,884
My world.

727
01:04:39,260 --> 01:04:42,939
From here there are world,
above world, above world.

728
01:04:43,400 --> 01:04:45,818
Going further up and you can imagine.

729
01:04:46,495 --> 01:04:49,314
The trash of each one
flows down to one below.

730
01:04:49,510 --> 01:04:51,666
Until it all ends up here.

731
01:04:52,955 --> 01:04:55,329
This is where I used to live.

732
01:04:55,494 --> 01:04:57,658
And that's where you're going to die.

733
01:05:28,073 --> 01:05:29,835
Dance, little flea!

734
01:06:12,471 --> 01:06:14,821
I was forgotten here and rotten.

735
01:06:15,200 --> 01:06:16,619
But I was saved.

736
01:06:16,916 --> 01:06:18,261
Remade.

737
01:06:18,276 --> 01:06:21,969
By the same hand
that shift your destiny even now.

738
01:06:23,423 --> 01:06:25,611
- Whose hand?
- My master.

739
01:06:26,253 --> 01:06:27,339
Nova

740
01:06:27,377 --> 01:06:29,377
What do you know about me?

741
01:06:59,408 --> 01:07:02,416
You... have the sould of a survivor.

742
01:07:04,737 --> 01:07:06,721
No. Never give up.

743
01:07:11,261 --> 01:07:12,940
Know what is hidden.

744
01:07:13,518 --> 01:07:15,116
Always ask...

745
01:07:15,682 --> 01:07:18,193
...what is it that you are not seen.

746
01:07:20,049 --> 01:07:21,211
Nova.

747
01:07:21,329 --> 01:07:24,221
He's the dragon that must be slain.

748
01:07:26,573 --> 01:07:28,101
Again!

749
01:07:28,425 --> 01:07:29,878
Look at you.

750
01:07:30,784 --> 01:07:32,448
Where are you going?

751
01:07:41,581 --> 01:07:43,034
What's the matter?

752
01:07:43,410 --> 01:07:46,448
My little toy doesn't want to play anymore?

753
01:07:46,704 --> 01:07:50,604
I'll turn you into living pendant
to adorn my chess.

754
01:07:51,182 --> 01:07:54,267
And then I can hear your voice
every moment of the day.

755
01:07:56,738 --> 01:07:58,190
No!

756
01:08:23,381 --> 01:08:24,777
Break off!

757
01:08:29,109 --> 01:08:30,876
He wasn't a dog lover.

758
01:08:31,394 --> 01:08:32,787
I hate that.

759
01:08:35,008 --> 01:08:36,554
Oh, come here...

760
01:08:41,850 --> 01:08:43,244
I'm sorry.

761
01:08:44,935 --> 01:08:46,486
I'm so sory.

762
01:08:55,575 --> 01:08:57,963
You think you can replace that
so easily?

763
01:08:58,927 --> 01:09:01,642
Bring her back
as many time as you like.

764
01:09:37,028 --> 01:09:39,655
No one will dare harm you again.

765
01:09:55,280 --> 01:09:58,679
It's the adapted technology
of the Berserker body.

766
01:10:00,833 --> 01:10:05,062
The cell is reconfiguring
to her subconscious images of herself.

767
01:10:07,271 --> 01:10:09,437
I've never seen anything like it.

768
01:10:10,029 --> 01:10:14,163
It's making micro adjustments
throughout every system.

769
01:10:18,615 --> 01:10:20,944
Looks like she's a little older
than you thought.

770
01:10:41,560 --> 01:10:44,074
Well... look at you.

771
01:11:05,911 --> 01:11:07,654
Oh, you were right.

772
01:11:08,099 --> 01:11:11,303
A warrior spirit
needs a warrior body.

773
01:11:21,467 --> 01:11:24,576
It draws in air,
generating an arc plasma.

774
01:11:24,593 --> 01:11:27,084
Ehm... you can control it.
I don't know.

775
01:11:27,240 --> 01:11:29,662
Didn't exactly come
with the manual, did you?

776
01:11:30,200 --> 01:11:32,026
Some kind of weapon.

777
01:11:39,818 --> 01:11:41,682
Now you know who you are.

778
01:11:50,990 --> 01:11:52,846
But that's just a shell.

779
01:11:54,172 --> 01:11:56,315
It's not bad or good...

780
01:11:57,574 --> 01:11:59,325
...that part up to you.

781
01:12:21,320 --> 01:12:22,456
Alita!

782
01:12:25,468 --> 01:12:26,557
Wow.

783
01:12:27,771 --> 01:12:28,924
You're...

784
01:12:29,518 --> 01:12:30,657
Back together?

785
01:12:30,682 --> 01:12:32,854
Very back together.

786
01:12:34,841 --> 01:12:36,161
You look...

787
01:12:37,093 --> 01:12:38,227
...different.

788
01:12:38,252 --> 01:12:39,657
It's all nano-tech.

789
01:12:39,682 --> 01:12:41,704
It's bunch of stuff even
Ido hasn't figured out yet.

790
01:12:41,729 --> 01:12:43,758
- So you're stronger than you were?
- Yeah.

791
01:12:43,853 --> 01:12:45,378
And faster than you.

792
01:12:46,519 --> 01:12:47,661
It feels...

793
01:12:48,873 --> 01:12:50,286
...more me.

794
01:12:54,224 --> 01:12:56,724
You know some guys might be
intimidated by girl like you.

795
01:12:56,748 --> 01:12:58,238
Really?
Why is that?

796
01:12:58,249 --> 01:13:01,385
Because you could rip my arm off
and beat me with the wet end.

797
01:13:02,497 --> 01:13:03,693
Well then...

798
01:13:03,790 --> 01:13:05,247
...don't piss me off.

799
01:13:06,403 --> 01:13:08,087
Why don't you like her?

800
01:13:08,888 --> 01:13:11,551
I just never got
that whole heart body thing.

801
01:13:11,982 --> 01:13:13,690
And beside she's URM.

802
01:13:13,701 --> 01:13:15,831
It means she's probably
the enemy at one point.

803
01:13:15,842 --> 01:13:16,845
Yeah.

804
01:13:17,270 --> 01:13:19,321
300 years ago.

805
01:13:19,643 --> 01:13:20,896
Get over it.

806
01:13:23,878 --> 01:13:26,044
I'm a lot more touch sensitive too.

807
01:13:26,537 --> 01:13:29,203
A lot higher of density
of force feedback and...

808
01:13:30,192 --> 01:13:31,750
...texture censor.

809
01:13:33,676 --> 01:13:35,030
You wanna try it?

810
01:13:43,394 --> 01:13:45,019
You can feel this?

811
01:13:45,130 --> 01:13:46,316
Yes.

812
01:13:51,457 --> 01:13:52,904
Close your eyes.

813
01:13:53,376 --> 01:13:55,076
Close your eyes.

814
01:14:01,818 --> 01:14:03,390
How about this?

815
01:14:03,911 --> 01:14:04,966
Yes.

816
01:14:10,029 --> 01:14:11,625
Where am I now?

817
01:14:13,224 --> 01:14:14,405
You...

818
01:14:16,765 --> 01:14:18,251
...with me.

819
01:14:37,139 --> 01:14:38,884
Does it bother you?

820
01:14:40,341 --> 01:14:42,455
That I'm not completely human?

821
01:14:43,240 --> 01:14:47,127
You're the most human person
I have ever met.

822
01:15:02,912 --> 01:15:04,911
He won't even let me fix his eye.

823
01:15:04,936 --> 01:15:06,982
He says he wants the pain.

824
01:15:13,162 --> 01:15:14,338
Enough.

825
01:15:19,815 --> 01:15:20,955
Nova.

826
01:15:26,387 --> 01:15:27,935
You've failed me.

827
01:15:30,740 --> 01:15:32,068
Stand.

828
01:15:35,974 --> 01:15:39,174
You will never triumph
until you understand what she is.

829
01:15:39,951 --> 01:15:41,851
She is the last of her kind.

830
01:15:41,969 --> 01:15:44,408
The finest weapon
of the URM Technarchy.

831
01:15:45,755 --> 01:15:48,033
I need you to destroy this Alita.

832
01:15:48,734 --> 01:15:50,783
I need you to bring me her heart.

833
01:15:53,108 --> 01:15:55,330
I live only for her death.

834
01:16:03,748 --> 01:16:05,718
I hate when he does that.

835
01:16:09,256 --> 01:16:11,836
This is not a man
who tolerate failure.

836
01:16:13,442 --> 01:16:16,429
I'm not trusting
my future to a piece of iron.

837
01:16:16,661 --> 01:16:18,382
What do you have in mind?

838
01:16:28,193 --> 01:16:29,525
To dream.

839
01:16:33,036 --> 01:16:34,940
I like your drive, Hugo.

840
01:16:35,107 --> 01:16:37,491
You have a solid future with my team.

841
01:16:38,935 --> 01:16:40,866
My future is in Zalem.

842
01:16:41,599 --> 01:16:43,614
I remember your promise everyday.

843
01:16:44,477 --> 01:16:46,006
To send me up.

844
01:16:46,732 --> 01:16:48,731
I wanna get you a million credits.

845
01:16:49,319 --> 01:16:50,802
Personally,

846
01:16:51,708 --> 01:16:55,348
I'd rather rule in hell
than serve in heaven.

847
01:16:58,075 --> 01:17:00,208
To be at the bottom
of the food chain up there.

848
01:17:00,233 --> 01:17:01,817
But down here...

849
01:17:02,771 --> 01:17:04,693
...we could live like kings.

850
01:17:07,560 --> 01:17:08,692
So...

851
01:17:09,208 --> 01:17:11,020
...tell me about this friend of yours.

852
01:17:12,520 --> 01:17:13,535
Alita

853
01:17:14,013 --> 01:17:15,380
That her name.

854
01:17:15,430 --> 01:17:16,591
Alita.

855
01:17:33,286 --> 01:17:34,362
Hi.

856
01:17:35,042 --> 01:17:36,098
Hi.

857
01:17:41,412 --> 01:17:43,114
What happened to you?

858
01:17:43,576 --> 01:17:46,059
I wound up hanging out with Vector.

859
01:17:47,013 --> 01:17:49,216
Some alcohol was involved.

860
01:17:50,310 --> 01:17:51,692
Apparently.

861
01:17:52,560 --> 01:17:53,859
So Vector...

862
01:17:53,870 --> 01:17:56,139
...is that your connection
for getting into Zalem?

863
01:17:57,069 --> 01:17:58,145
Yeah.

864
01:17:58,413 --> 01:17:59,362
Oh...

865
01:18:00,583 --> 01:18:02,582
I was hoping maybe you'd want to stay.

866
01:18:03,578 --> 01:18:04,636
Hey.

867
01:18:05,435 --> 01:18:07,114
It's not right away.

868
01:18:07,567 --> 01:18:09,684
I still gotta race
the rest of the money first.

869
01:18:09,709 --> 01:18:10,964
It's OK.

870
01:18:12,480 --> 01:18:13,965
It's your dream.

871
01:18:14,097 --> 01:18:16,409
I know it's what you've always wanted.

872
01:18:19,863 --> 01:18:21,199
You know...

873
01:18:22,700 --> 01:18:24,599
I was always so sure.

874
01:18:27,662 --> 01:18:29,529
And you came along.

875
01:18:30,514 --> 01:18:32,248
Nothing is clear anymore.

876
01:18:48,273 --> 01:18:51,022
How much more do you need
before you can go?

877
01:18:52,943 --> 01:18:54,217
90K.

878
01:18:54,684 --> 01:18:56,174
90K?

879
01:18:56,850 --> 01:18:58,836
I can make that in bounties.

880
01:18:58,846 --> 01:19:01,807
I'll just figure out who has the highest prize
on their head than I'll take them out.

881
01:19:01,834 --> 01:19:04,120
No. I can't ask you to do that for me.

882
01:19:04,131 --> 01:19:06,276
I'd do whatever
I had to for you.

883
01:19:07,466 --> 01:19:09,365
I'll give you whatever I have.

884
01:19:09,390 --> 01:19:10,807
What are you doing?

885
01:19:13,265 --> 01:19:14,989
I give you my heart.

886
01:19:16,474 --> 01:19:17,831
Take it.

887
01:19:18,513 --> 01:19:22,138
It's got an URM micro reactor
for power supply probably worth millions.

888
01:19:22,257 --> 01:19:24,202
With your connection
you can find a buyer.

889
01:19:24,221 --> 01:19:26,155
You can make enough
for both of us to go to Zalem.

890
01:19:26,166 --> 01:19:28,309
- Then we'll just find a cheaper replacement.
- No.

891
01:19:29,959 --> 01:19:32,885
Come on,
you buy and sell parts all day long.

892
01:19:35,499 --> 01:19:38,005
Don't just do things for people.

893
01:19:38,874 --> 01:19:42,247
No matter how good you think they are
or how deserving they are.

894
01:19:43,382 --> 01:19:45,394
It's all or nothing with me.

895
01:19:47,210 --> 01:19:48,760
This is who I am.

896
01:19:49,944 --> 01:19:51,167
I know.

897
01:19:54,069 --> 01:19:55,286
It's OK.

898
01:19:56,079 --> 01:19:57,457
Put it back.

899
01:20:10,483 --> 01:20:12,540
That was pretty intense, huh?

900
01:20:14,953 --> 01:20:16,641
Ya, that was very intense.

901
01:20:18,804 --> 01:20:20,016
Sorry.

902
01:20:21,702 --> 01:20:23,701
Maybe there is another way.

903
01:20:24,396 --> 01:20:27,091
Vector wants you to try out
for Second League.

904
01:20:27,102 --> 01:20:28,154
Apa?

905
01:20:28,468 --> 01:20:30,522
You become a big Motorball star.

906
01:20:30,533 --> 01:20:32,330
Make a pile of money.

907
01:20:32,455 --> 01:20:34,454
We can go Zalem together.

908
01:20:34,648 --> 01:20:35,812
What are you talking about?

909
01:20:35,823 --> 01:20:38,194
I can't be a pro Motorball player.

910
01:20:38,937 --> 01:20:39,975
Ali...

911
01:20:41,095 --> 01:20:42,799
...you can be a champion.

912
01:20:43,717 --> 01:20:45,249
You win this tryout,

913
01:20:45,260 --> 01:20:48,158
every scout will be killing
each other to get you.

914
01:20:49,508 --> 01:20:51,217
We'll be home free.

915
01:20:51,437 --> 01:20:53,703
Only if you'll be my coach.

916
01:20:54,138 --> 01:20:55,808
Well if that what it takes.

917
01:20:55,819 --> 01:20:57,248
It's all that it takes.

918
01:21:04,507 --> 01:21:06,186
Do you think you can kill her?

919
01:21:06,529 --> 01:21:07,684
Nah.

920
01:21:07,900 --> 01:21:09,568
Much worse.

921
01:21:23,589 --> 01:21:26,059
Ido, can a human love a cyborg?

922
01:21:27,148 --> 01:21:28,320
Why?

923
01:21:28,539 --> 01:21:31,196
Does this cyborg love a human?

924
01:21:35,090 --> 01:21:36,406
Hmm...

925
01:21:37,499 --> 01:21:39,677
A human can love a cyborg.

926
01:21:39,688 --> 01:21:42,148
But you have to keep
your mind on the game, Alita.

927
01:21:43,100 --> 01:21:45,685
It can get very rough out there.

928
01:21:45,697 --> 01:21:47,691
Even for a tryout.

929
01:21:48,476 --> 01:21:49,872
Try this.

930
01:21:52,062 --> 01:21:54,248
Do you make this for me?

931
01:21:54,587 --> 01:21:55,677
Yes.

932
01:21:57,155 --> 01:22:00,527
It won't make you any faster.
It's regulation.

933
01:22:01,670 --> 01:22:04,154
But at least they won't fail you.

934
01:22:07,899 --> 01:22:09,446
Here's our deal.

935
01:22:10,625 --> 01:22:11,919
You go in there,

936
01:22:11,930 --> 01:22:14,792
you race, you win,
you come back right here.

937
01:22:14,916 --> 01:22:16,946
And you wear all of this pads.

938
01:22:16,957 --> 01:22:19,268
Especially this one.

939
01:22:21,204 --> 01:22:23,024
I don't need all this crap.

940
01:22:23,140 --> 01:22:24,539
Yes, you do.

941
01:22:25,546 --> 01:22:26,735
Remember,

942
01:22:27,094 --> 01:22:29,388
if you wreck this body,
I can't fix it.

943
01:22:29,399 --> 01:22:32,014
- This is URM technology.
- Yes, I know.

944
01:22:32,290 --> 01:22:35,701
You're gonna find a place to watch
because you're making me nervous.

945
01:22:38,451 --> 01:22:39,632
Good luck.

946
01:22:40,327 --> 01:22:41,594
Bye.

947
01:22:58,109 --> 01:23:00,878
Thank you for coming
on the such short notice.

948
01:23:00,992 --> 01:23:04,951
You are the scum of the game.

949
01:23:05,233 --> 01:23:07,787
But tonight you're hand-picked scum.

950
01:23:08,241 --> 01:23:10,328
Because tonight is not a game.

951
01:23:10,339 --> 01:23:11,797
Its is a hunt.

952
01:23:12,335 --> 01:23:14,929
I'm paying 500.000...

953
01:23:15,079 --> 01:23:17,177
...to the one who kill...

954
01:23:17,611 --> 01:23:19,795
...the girl called Alita.

955
01:23:26,405 --> 01:23:27,244
Hi.

956
01:23:27,255 --> 01:23:29,239
Where are you?
The trial is about to start.

957
01:23:29,250 --> 01:23:30,802
I'm on my way.

958
01:23:30,960 --> 01:23:32,841
But something i've gotta do first.

959
01:23:32,853 --> 01:23:35,552
I'm doing this for us, remember?
You can't miss it.

960
01:23:35,563 --> 01:23:37,357
I won't.
Trust me.

961
01:23:41,310 --> 01:23:42,568
Wait!

962
01:23:42,715 --> 01:23:44,123
Just stop!

963
01:23:44,134 --> 01:23:45,763
I didn't do anything to you.

964
01:23:45,774 --> 01:23:47,991
It's just a business.
Nothing personal.

965
01:23:50,851 --> 01:23:52,529
Tanji, stop!

966
01:23:54,288 --> 01:23:55,647
Using my name?

967
01:23:57,153 --> 01:23:58,794
Man, what's wrong with you?

968
01:24:00,434 --> 01:24:02,053
I can't do this anymore.

969
01:24:02,499 --> 01:24:04,785
What's the matter?
You already gone half the time.

970
01:24:04,796 --> 01:24:06,795
Now you show up
with line of this crap?

971
01:24:06,916 --> 01:24:08,584
It's your little hardbody, isn't it?

972
01:24:10,156 --> 01:24:12,209
It's over.
Do you understand?

973
01:24:12,472 --> 01:24:13,768
I'm out.

974
01:24:13,790 --> 01:24:16,554
And if you had any brain,
you'd leave behind too.

975
01:24:18,374 --> 01:24:19,707
I'm out!

976
01:24:20,750 --> 01:24:21,935
For good.

977
01:24:23,718 --> 01:24:26,232
You should've jacked that bitch
when we had the chance.

978
01:24:26,251 --> 01:24:28,251
We'll be on your way
to Zalem right now.

979
01:24:43,952 --> 01:24:45,475
Very professional.

980
01:24:45,487 --> 01:24:47,124
Hey man,
we dont want any trouble.

981
01:24:47,135 --> 01:24:48,921
If this is your mark, we're sorry.

982
01:24:48,932 --> 01:24:50,342
He's all yours.

983
01:24:52,328 --> 01:24:53,404
Hugo.

984
01:24:54,336 --> 01:24:56,008
Jacking cyborg.

985
01:24:56,390 --> 01:24:59,234
Your little girlfriend might take this
kinda personally, dont you think?

986
01:25:00,079 --> 01:25:01,083
Hmm?

987
01:25:01,498 --> 01:25:02,843
You know girls.

988
01:25:03,788 --> 01:25:06,380
She'll probably get a weepy
dan forgive you...

989
01:25:07,851 --> 01:25:09,554
...when I show your head.

990
01:25:09,565 --> 01:25:11,195
There's no marker out on me.

991
01:25:18,047 --> 01:25:19,445
There will be.

992
01:25:19,992 --> 01:25:22,279
Murders pulls high level bounty.

993
01:25:23,241 --> 01:25:25,389
Even with gutter trash like you.

994
01:25:25,570 --> 01:25:27,570
I never killed anyone.

995
01:25:33,390 --> 01:25:35,029
You just did.

996
01:25:40,594 --> 01:25:42,896
She thinks she can punk me, huh?

997
01:25:44,205 --> 01:25:46,205
Stop!

998
01:25:48,194 --> 01:25:49,904
Hugo, run!

999
01:26:55,148 --> 01:26:57,499
Next stop is second league tryout.

1000
01:26:57,510 --> 01:27:01,109
Where the Factory practice team
report to the line.

1001
01:27:08,828 --> 01:27:14,226
The winner tonight will make one step closer
to qualifying for the champions league.

1002
01:27:14,609 --> 01:27:17,007
That is one tough line up.

1003
01:27:17,018 --> 01:27:19,460
This is gonna be one heck
of the match tonight.

1004
01:27:27,711 --> 01:27:29,780
That's not Factory team.

1005
01:27:30,336 --> 01:27:31,398
What?

1006
01:27:31,929 --> 01:27:34,047
These two punks in the back,

1007
01:27:34,183 --> 01:27:36,288
there are bounty marker on them.

1008
01:27:38,194 --> 01:27:41,826
And the other guys,
they're Hunter Warriors.

1009
01:27:50,296 --> 01:27:54,076
And here comes tonight
one new prospect.

1010
01:27:54,228 --> 01:27:55,975
OK then folks,

1011
01:27:55,986 --> 01:27:59,000
give it up for, Alita!

1012
01:28:00,726 --> 01:28:02,725
Hugo brought her right to us.

1013
01:28:03,117 --> 01:28:05,435
What've you promised him?

1014
01:28:07,078 --> 01:28:09,341
I'm sending him to Zalem of course.

1015
01:28:19,444 --> 01:28:20,414
Alita!

1016
01:28:20,696 --> 01:28:22,138
Alita!

1017
01:28:25,937 --> 01:28:26,664
Hi.

1018
01:28:26,682 --> 01:28:28,531
Since there is only one new prospect,

1019
01:28:28,542 --> 01:28:29,656
What's up?

1020
01:28:29,667 --> 01:28:31,754
There will be no team.

1021
01:28:31,765 --> 01:28:35,071
The name of the game is Cut-Throat.

1022
01:28:39,483 --> 01:28:41,632
Go easy on me, guys.

1023
01:28:41,998 --> 01:28:43,300
Sure, kid.

1024
01:28:43,897 --> 01:28:45,783
No worries.

1025
01:28:48,712 --> 01:28:49,830
Alita!

1026
01:28:50,125 --> 01:28:51,266
Apa are you doing?

1027
01:28:51,277 --> 01:28:53,277
It's a setup.
You gotta get out of there.

1028
01:28:53,288 --> 01:28:54,781
They're gonna kill you.

1029
01:28:58,555 --> 01:28:59,842
Which one?

1030
01:28:59,853 --> 01:29:01,280
All of them!

1031
01:29:04,094 --> 01:29:07,099
Players, 10 seconds warning.

1032
01:29:13,694 --> 01:29:15,216
5 seconds.

1033
01:29:33,369 --> 01:29:37,834
The new kid, Alita,
takes possession right of the snap.

1034
01:29:46,662 --> 01:29:51,117
A slow Tuesday night just about
hotter than a player.

1035
01:30:00,751 --> 01:30:03,009
Looks like the fans
have themselves...

1036
01:30:03,020 --> 01:30:05,025
...their underdog darling.

1037
01:30:05,036 --> 01:30:06,860
With a face of an angel...

1038
01:30:06,871 --> 01:30:09,294
...and a body built for battle.

1039
01:30:20,319 --> 01:30:21,928
Oh... crap.

1040
01:30:48,503 --> 01:30:50,638
Ouch... she knows better.

1041
01:30:51,792 --> 01:30:53,133
Fuck!

1042
01:30:55,256 --> 01:30:58,377
Stinger got Alita
in a lot of trouble.

1043
01:31:10,175 --> 01:31:12,716
She must've said something
in the locker room...

1044
01:31:12,727 --> 01:31:14,990
...that these guys
did not like.

1045
01:31:34,376 --> 01:31:39,442
No. 99.
Alita!

1046
01:31:44,101 --> 01:31:45,999
Ali, it's me.

1047
01:31:46,414 --> 01:31:47,773
I got a big problem.

1048
01:31:47,784 --> 01:31:50,116
Hugo, this is not a good time.

1049
01:31:50,640 --> 01:31:52,226
He's trying to kill me.

1050
01:31:52,836 --> 01:31:54,148
Who's trying to kill you?

1051
01:31:54,236 --> 01:31:55,311
Zapan.

1052
01:31:55,484 --> 01:31:56,863
The Hunter Warrior.

1053
01:31:56,904 --> 01:31:58,536
He killed Tanji.

1054
01:31:59,279 --> 01:32:00,692
What do you mean?

1055
01:32:00,914 --> 01:32:02,800
Now he's coming for me.

1056
01:32:06,858 --> 01:32:10,433
I'm not sure hard battle
can get out of this one.

1057
01:32:11,531 --> 01:32:13,575
Shit, here he comes.

1058
01:32:15,461 --> 01:32:18,012
- Where are you?
- Headed to the old church.

1059
01:32:19,430 --> 01:32:21,430
OK, I'm coming.

1060
01:32:29,320 --> 01:32:31,836
I can't believe it!
Incredible!

1061
01:32:31,847 --> 01:32:34,256
I've never seen
anything like it.

1062
01:33:34,929 --> 01:33:36,928
Hey. I'm almost there.

1063
01:33:37,538 --> 01:33:38,653
Got it.

1064
01:34:40,780 --> 01:34:42,341
Where are you going, huh?

1065
01:35:09,964 --> 01:35:11,964
<font color="#ffff00">MURDER</font>

1066
01:35:12,007 --> 01:35:15,153
Looks like your Hugo hasn't been
entirely honest with you.

1067
01:35:16,789 --> 01:35:18,106
Is it true?

1068
01:35:18,742 --> 01:35:19,920
Alita...

1069
01:35:21,224 --> 01:35:22,569
You don't understand.

1070
01:35:27,827 --> 01:35:29,926
I've never killed anyone.

1071
01:35:30,825 --> 01:35:32,865
We only jacked parts.

1072
01:35:34,023 --> 01:35:35,569
We paralysed them...

1073
01:35:35,580 --> 01:35:36,787
...and stripped them.

1074
01:35:36,798 --> 01:35:37,862
That's all.

1075
01:35:39,609 --> 01:35:41,793
I needed the money for Zalem.

1076
01:35:43,194 --> 01:35:45,465
Step aside and let me do my job.

1077
01:35:49,023 --> 01:35:51,598
You touch him again,
and I will kill you.

1078
01:35:51,609 --> 01:35:54,773
Interference between a licensed
Hunter Warrior and his kill...

1079
01:35:54,784 --> 01:35:57,739
...is a violation of Factory Law
and Hunter's Code.

1080
01:35:57,750 --> 01:35:59,325
He's mine!

1081
01:36:01,234 --> 01:36:03,051
Then make the kill.

1082
01:36:10,538 --> 01:36:12,184
Come on Hunter Warrior.

1083
01:36:14,367 --> 01:36:16,770
Tonight you become one of us.

1084
01:36:24,483 --> 01:36:28,238
You know there is no room for
love or mercy in Hunter's Code.

1085
01:36:36,374 --> 01:36:38,374
Let me make it easier for you.

1086
01:36:46,437 --> 01:36:47,604
Hugo!

1087
01:36:52,421 --> 01:36:56,581
Deliver the criminal Hugo,
bounty 9107.

1088
01:36:56,664 --> 01:36:58,730
Wanted for a crime of murder.

1089
01:36:59,532 --> 01:37:02,005
You better finish him before we do!

1090
01:37:02,016 --> 01:37:04,016
It's Hunter's law.

1091
01:37:11,726 --> 01:37:13,215
I have to get you to Ido.

1092
01:37:13,226 --> 01:37:14,098
No.

1093
01:37:14,109 --> 01:37:15,597
Centurion.

1094
01:37:15,707 --> 01:37:17,816
You go back out there with me alive,

1095
01:37:17,827 --> 01:37:19,683
they'll kill us both.

1096
01:37:23,343 --> 01:37:24,804
What did you do?

1097
01:37:24,815 --> 01:37:26,622
What did you do?

1098
01:37:28,874 --> 01:37:30,874
I didn't kill that guy.

1099
01:37:32,601 --> 01:37:34,421
But what is it matter?

1100
01:37:36,562 --> 01:37:38,823
I tore people apart.

1101
01:37:38,834 --> 01:37:40,616
People like you.

1102
01:37:40,767 --> 01:37:42,206
For money.

1103
01:37:44,736 --> 01:37:46,339
Where were you tonight?

1104
01:37:47,061 --> 01:37:49,190
I want to stop the others.

1105
01:37:49,354 --> 01:37:50,992
And tell them I quit.

1106
01:37:51,003 --> 01:37:52,171
Why?

1107
01:37:53,070 --> 01:37:54,760
Because I love you.

1108
01:37:59,694 --> 01:38:01,066
I'm sorry.

1109
01:38:05,128 --> 01:38:06,626
I'm sorry.

1110
01:38:16,311 --> 01:38:17,725
Did you find them?

1111
01:38:18,812 --> 01:38:19,799
No.

1112
01:38:20,952 --> 01:38:22,209
They are gone.

1113
01:38:26,860 --> 01:38:28,423
You're so cold.

1114
01:38:28,711 --> 01:38:30,399
Please don't die.

1115
01:38:31,351 --> 01:38:33,024
Please don't...

1116
01:38:41,734 --> 01:38:44,255
I'd give him my life I could.

1117
01:38:58,093 --> 01:38:59,739
Maybe you can.

1118
01:39:05,491 --> 01:39:08,096
You've violated Factory Law
and Hunter's Code...

1119
01:39:08,115 --> 01:39:10,162
...by protecting a wanted felon.

1120
01:39:11,601 --> 01:39:15,500
Where's criminal Hugo,
bounty 9107?

1121
01:39:21,281 --> 01:39:22,812
Hugo is dead.

1122
01:39:22,823 --> 01:39:24,413
I claim the bounty.

1123
01:39:24,483 --> 01:39:27,133
Hunter Warrior 26651.

1124
01:39:28,240 --> 01:39:30,094
Claim confirmed.

1125
01:39:37,493 --> 01:39:38,617
Oh...

1126
01:39:41,140 --> 01:39:42,813
That's a cute trick.

1127
01:39:43,187 --> 01:39:45,655
You think this is gonna work?
Hmm?

1128
01:39:46,843 --> 01:39:49,047
Give me that.

1129
01:39:49,168 --> 01:39:50,461
Violation!

1130
01:39:50,907 --> 01:39:52,676
Hunter Warrior off hand.

1131
01:39:52,693 --> 01:39:54,576
Stealing on others bounty...

1132
01:39:54,588 --> 01:39:57,354
...is against Factory Law
and Hunter's Code.

1133
01:39:57,656 --> 01:39:59,014
Thanks.

1134
01:40:02,771 --> 01:40:04,021
May face.

1135
01:40:04,628 --> 01:40:06,443
May face!

1136
01:40:07,522 --> 01:40:09,155
May face!

1137
01:40:09,166 --> 01:40:10,366
No.

1138
01:40:25,444 --> 01:40:27,022
How is he?

1139
01:40:33,999 --> 01:40:37,608
This city... corrupt.
Even a good people.

1140
01:40:43,179 --> 01:40:44,475
He's good.

1141
01:40:44,998 --> 01:40:46,389
He's stabil.

1142
01:40:53,758 --> 01:40:56,770
Chiren's surgical technique
was brilliant.

1143
01:40:58,843 --> 01:41:00,842
There is no brain damage.

1144
01:41:07,960 --> 01:41:10,363
Vector was running a scam.

1145
01:41:10,616 --> 01:41:13,030
If you born on the ground,
you stay on the ground.

1146
01:41:13,041 --> 01:41:15,110
No one or a lot of money
can change that.

1147
01:41:15,121 --> 01:41:17,940
The only one way to get from
the lower groud to Zalem...

1148
01:41:17,951 --> 01:41:19,694
...is to become final champion.

1149
01:41:19,772 --> 01:41:22,112
You can't buy your way up there.

1150
01:41:22,780 --> 01:41:24,859
But how do you know that for sure?

1151
01:41:28,742 --> 01:41:30,342
I was born there.

1152
01:41:32,742 --> 01:41:36,066
I've removed it myself.
Mark of Zalem.

1153
01:41:38,124 --> 01:41:39,767
With our daughter's illness,

1154
01:41:39,778 --> 01:41:42,501
Chiren and I were forced
to descend to Iron City.

1155
01:41:43,327 --> 01:41:46,277
The man who responsible for her exile...

1156
01:41:46,418 --> 01:41:48,739
...and the watcher behind the eyes...

1157
01:41:49,109 --> 01:41:50,433
...is Nova.

1158
01:41:52,477 --> 01:41:54,832
You had her heart in your hands...

1159
01:41:56,537 --> 01:41:58,410
...and you let her live.

1160
01:42:00,226 --> 01:42:02,042
- I did.
- Why?

1161
01:42:04,047 --> 01:42:05,944
Because I'm a doctor.

1162
01:42:06,674 --> 01:42:07,753
And...

1163
01:42:09,732 --> 01:42:11,130
...I'm a mother.

1164
01:42:13,148 --> 01:42:15,148
And somehow I forgot that.

1165
01:42:18,203 --> 01:42:20,203
I can't do this anymore.

1166
01:42:22,514 --> 01:42:23,870
I'm out.

1167
01:42:27,072 --> 01:42:28,623
Chiren, wait.

1168
01:42:39,742 --> 01:42:42,097
Don't you think it's time
you want to Zalem?

1169
01:42:44,398 --> 01:42:46,699
I have to send you
up there right now.

1170
01:42:47,366 --> 01:42:49,074
What I want...

1171
01:42:50,976 --> 01:42:52,667
...it isn't up there.

1172
01:43:11,897 --> 01:43:13,433
I gotta do something.

1173
01:43:14,585 --> 01:43:16,312
I'll come back for you.

1174
01:43:19,156 --> 01:43:20,781
This is my fault.

1175
01:43:24,312 --> 01:43:25,663
This is my fault.

1176
01:43:26,030 --> 01:43:28,245
Don't you ever feel sorry for yourself.

1177
01:43:29,718 --> 01:43:32,081
You're the only one built for this.

1178
01:43:33,632 --> 01:43:35,202
Thank you, Father.

1179
01:43:54,203 --> 01:43:55,761
Vector!

1180
01:43:57,421 --> 01:43:59,245
Hostile intention detected.

1181
01:43:59,256 --> 01:44:01,046
Surrender your weapon.

1182
01:44:09,757 --> 01:44:11,538
Surrender your weapon!

1183
01:44:30,754 --> 01:44:32,171
Security report.

1184
01:44:35,663 --> 01:44:38,468
Violation, violation, violation...

1185
01:44:43,687 --> 01:44:45,382
Did you get her?

1186
01:44:45,645 --> 01:44:46,890
Security.

1187
01:44:54,577 --> 01:44:57,101
You were never going
to send Hugo to Zalem.

1188
01:44:57,507 --> 01:44:58,954
Were you?

1189
01:45:02,952 --> 01:45:05,633
I always keep my promise
to send people up.

1190
01:45:08,960 --> 01:45:10,952
Like Dr. Chiren.

1191
01:45:13,343 --> 01:45:16,491
Nova demands body parts
for his experiments.

1192
01:45:16,906 --> 01:45:19,906
Especially the brain
of the people he admires.

1193
01:45:23,648 --> 01:45:27,267
And that is the only way
anyone ever gets to Zalem.

1194
01:45:33,461 --> 01:45:35,265
It took you long enough.

1195
01:45:38,952 --> 01:45:42,843
I knew you wouldn't wait for
your faith to find you, little flea.

1196
01:45:43,444 --> 01:45:44,702
Get up.

1197
01:45:55,859 --> 01:45:57,859
Defense Ring!

1198
01:46:25,201 --> 01:46:26,927
Finish the mission.

1199
01:46:27,197 --> 01:46:29,898
Destroy Zalem.

1200
01:46:34,835 --> 01:46:37,835
Destroy Zalem.

1201
01:46:51,484 --> 01:46:53,483
I know who my enemy is.

1202
01:46:54,796 --> 01:46:57,077
And I know he's watching us now.

1203
01:46:58,960 --> 01:47:00,811
And you're just his slave.

1204
01:47:09,640 --> 01:47:12,242
And I'm just an insignificant girl.

1205
01:47:39,085 --> 01:47:40,597
- Speak!
- No.

1206
01:47:40,608 --> 01:47:42,553
No, no.
Wait.

1207
01:47:42,564 --> 01:47:43,483
Speak!

1208
01:47:43,494 --> 01:47:45,406
What do you want me to say,
I'll say anything.

1209
01:47:45,417 --> 01:47:46,862
Not you.

1210
01:47:47,304 --> 01:47:48,397
Him!

1211
01:47:57,782 --> 01:47:59,909
So we finally meet, Alita.

1212
01:48:00,416 --> 01:48:02,483
Not your real name of course?

1213
01:48:02,552 --> 01:48:03,752
Nova?

1214
01:48:17,120 --> 01:48:18,457
Where are you?

1215
01:48:18,596 --> 01:48:19,659
Home.

1216
01:48:19,978 --> 01:48:21,188
As we speak.

1217
01:48:21,497 --> 01:48:22,736
Feet up.

1218
01:48:24,589 --> 01:48:27,788
Well my girl you certainly
exceeded my expectation.

1219
01:48:28,448 --> 01:48:30,716
Killing my champion Grewishka.

1220
01:48:31,206 --> 01:48:33,014
Most impressive.

1221
01:48:33,518 --> 01:48:36,294
And turning selfish a creature like Chiren.

1222
01:48:37,346 --> 01:48:39,192
I didn't see that coming.

1223
01:48:39,739 --> 01:48:41,866
So when you walk out of here...

1224
01:48:41,877 --> 01:48:44,090
...the Factory won't stop you.

1225
01:48:45,300 --> 01:48:46,505
This time.

1226
01:48:46,516 --> 01:48:49,177
I don't need your permission to live.

1227
01:48:49,387 --> 01:48:50,575
Others might.

1228
01:48:51,698 --> 01:48:53,697
Your Dr. Ido for example.

1229
01:48:54,541 --> 01:48:56,177
And what about Hugo?

1230
01:48:57,250 --> 01:48:59,140
He is still alive, isn't he?

1231
01:48:59,526 --> 01:49:01,293
And we'll track him down.

1232
01:49:02,416 --> 01:49:05,200
I found the only way
to enjoy immortality...

1233
01:49:05,909 --> 01:49:07,996
...is to watch others die.

1234
01:49:09,698 --> 01:49:11,821
You've just lost a puppet.

1235
01:49:15,135 --> 01:49:16,195
Well.

1236
01:49:16,556 --> 01:49:18,266
That looks fatal.

1237
01:49:18,700 --> 01:49:20,188
No matter.

1238
01:49:20,746 --> 01:49:22,985
The Vector was getting tiresome.

1239
01:49:26,308 --> 01:49:28,989
You've made the biggest mistake
of your life.

1240
01:49:30,112 --> 01:49:31,470
What's that?

1241
01:49:32,752 --> 01:49:35,087
Underestimating who I am.

1242
01:49:36,064 --> 01:49:37,813
Until next time.

1243
01:49:39,596 --> 01:49:40,852
Remember.

1244
01:49:44,736 --> 01:49:46,598
I see everything.

1245
01:49:52,408 --> 01:49:53,532
Alita.

1246
01:49:54,002 --> 01:49:56,220
Factory enforcers
came looking for Hugo.

1247
01:49:56,231 --> 01:49:58,455
Somehow they knew
he'd been kept alive.

1248
01:49:58,466 --> 01:50:00,953
I help him escape,
but they've sealed the city.

1249
01:50:00,964 --> 01:50:02,376
They're going to find him.

1250
01:50:02,387 --> 01:50:03,522
Where is he?

1251
01:50:03,847 --> 01:50:05,751
He's trying to go up.

1252
01:50:28,229 --> 01:50:29,252
Hugo!

1253
01:50:29,994 --> 01:50:30,970
Hugo!

1254
01:50:31,948 --> 01:50:33,278
Hugo!

1255
01:50:33,384 --> 01:50:34,437
Stop!

1256
01:50:34,489 --> 01:50:36,880
You have to come down.
We can't stay up here.

1257
01:50:36,891 --> 01:50:39,312
There's a bounty on me.
This is the only way.

1258
01:50:39,323 --> 01:50:42,039
No, this is dangerous!
We have to get down now!

1259
01:50:42,165 --> 01:50:43,970
If I go back down there,
I'm dead.

1260
01:50:43,981 --> 01:50:45,896
No, you have to listen to me, OK?

1261
01:50:45,907 --> 01:50:47,759
I've been right here before.

1262
01:50:47,770 --> 01:50:50,107
This is exactly what Nova wants you.

1263
01:50:50,118 --> 01:50:52,208
He's using you to get to me.

1264
01:50:52,219 --> 01:50:53,907
Come on,
we have to go back down.

1265
01:50:53,918 --> 01:50:55,820
We belong up there, Alita.

1266
01:50:57,104 --> 01:50:59,010
We dont belong anywhere....

1267
01:50:59,192 --> 01:51:00,962
...except together.

1268
01:51:04,925 --> 01:51:06,849
But we'll always be running.

1269
01:51:08,501 --> 01:51:09,731
Together.

1270
01:51:11,016 --> 01:51:12,611
Come with me.

1271
01:51:14,018 --> 01:51:15,357
Please.

1272
01:51:30,674 --> 01:51:31,815
OK.

1273
01:51:36,377 --> 01:51:37,535
No!

1274
01:51:59,215 --> 01:52:00,495
Hold on!

1275
01:52:01,217 --> 01:52:02,691
I got you!

1276
01:52:06,291 --> 01:52:07,718
OK, OK!

1277
01:52:07,877 --> 01:52:09,389
Don't move.

1278
01:52:10,306 --> 01:52:11,730
Don't move.

1279
01:52:12,049 --> 01:52:14,245
I'm gonna lift you up slowly.

1280
01:52:31,602 --> 01:52:32,874
Thank you.

1281
01:52:34,401 --> 01:52:35,902
For saving me.

1282
01:52:36,104 --> 01:52:37,563
I love you.

1283
01:52:38,331 --> 01:52:40,331
No!

1284
01:53:15,801 --> 01:53:18,254
It took her only
a few months to rise...

1285
01:53:18,265 --> 01:53:20,462
...through the ranks
of the Second League.

1286
01:53:20,518 --> 01:53:23,426
And tonight, she makes
her first appearance...

1287
01:53:23,437 --> 01:53:25,126
...in the Champions League.

1288
01:53:25,137 --> 01:53:29,344
Where she has the chance
at becoming final champion.

1289
01:53:29,369 --> 01:53:31,719
And going to Zalem.

1290
01:54:04,198 --> 01:54:07,469
...for the battle angel herself,

1291
01:54:07,488 --> 01:54:09,738
number 99,

1292
01:54:09,881 --> 01:54:12,683
Alita!

1293
01:54:57,147 --> 01:54:59,366
Alita! Alita!

1294
01:54:59,597 --> 01:55:01,827
Alita! Alita!

1295
01:55:01,838 --> 01:55:02,826
Alita!

1296
01:55:08,971 --> 01:55:10,971
Alita! Alita!

1297
01:55:11,186 --> 01:55:13,186
Alita! Alita!

1298
01:55:14,898 --> 01:55:34,898
