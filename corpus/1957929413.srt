1
00:02:38,636 --> 00:02:40,682
[chef 1] Come on.
Let's go. Marie?

2
00:02:40,856 --> 00:02:41,770
[kitchen staff shouting]

3
00:02:41,944 --> 00:02:42,988
The 6:30s are here.

4
00:02:43,163 --> 00:02:44,076
The serving staff
is on the floor.

5
00:02:44,251 --> 00:02:45,556
It's time.

6
00:02:45,730 --> 00:02:47,079
Perhaps you should
say something?

7
00:02:47,254 --> 00:02:49,473
Ordering one hamachi crudo,
two salad niçoises

8
00:02:49,647 --> 00:02:51,040
and one striped bass.

9
00:02:51,214 --> 00:02:52,694
Merde! Sebastian. Huh?

10
00:02:52,868 --> 00:02:54,870
We eighty-sixed the bass
an hour ago.

11
00:02:55,044 --> 00:02:57,699
Why is table 42
expecting something we can't deliver?

12
00:02:57,873 --> 00:02:59,353
There was a miscommunication.

13
00:02:59,527 --> 00:03:00,658
[French accent]
"Miscommunication."

14
00:03:00,832 --> 00:03:02,269
I speak four languages,

15
00:03:02,443 --> 00:03:03,879
and you're talking to me
about miscommunication?

16
00:03:04,053 --> 00:03:05,141
[Sebastian] Calm down.

17
00:03:05,315 --> 00:03:06,795
Your face will scare
the customers.

18
00:03:06,969 --> 00:03:08,797
My kitchen, my face, my rules.

19
00:03:08,971 --> 00:03:10,102
And what's my rule number one?

20
00:03:10,277 --> 00:03:11,321
Do not fuck with your kitchen.

21
00:03:11,495 --> 00:03:12,583
Voilà.

22
00:03:12,757 --> 00:03:13,976
Service!

23
00:03:14,150 --> 00:03:16,805
Welcome to Etoile Rouge.
Right this way.

24
00:03:16,979 --> 00:03:19,024
[jazz music playing]

25
00:03:31,211 --> 00:03:32,299
Bon appétit.

26
00:03:33,213 --> 00:03:34,649
[kitchen staff chattering]

27
00:03:37,478 --> 00:03:39,871
All right. How much longer
until I have my veggies done?

28
00:03:41,133 --> 00:03:42,657
Come on, guys.
I need them faster. Come on.

29
00:03:42,831 --> 00:03:44,093
[host] Chef Ana? Yes?

30
00:03:44,267 --> 00:03:45,703
The patrons could
really use some face time.

31
00:03:45,877 --> 00:03:47,531
I don't have the time.
They paid for a meal,

32
00:03:47,705 --> 00:03:49,359
but they also paid
to be schmoozed.

33
00:03:49,533 --> 00:03:50,708
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Wait, wait, wait.

34
00:03:50,882 --> 00:03:51,753
Show it to me.

35
00:03:51,927 --> 00:03:53,015
No. No. No.

36
00:03:53,189 --> 00:03:55,104
No, no, no, no, no. No, no, no.

37
00:03:55,278 --> 00:03:57,846
Look, the beurre blanc
is separated.

38
00:03:58,020 --> 00:03:59,587
Oui, Chef.

39
00:03:59,761 --> 00:04:01,153
It might taste the same,
but I know,

40
00:04:01,328 --> 00:04:03,504
and you really should know,
it's not right.

41
00:04:03,678 --> 00:04:04,896
Oui, Chef.

42
00:04:05,070 --> 00:04:07,072
Let me show you, okay?

43
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:09,510
And then quickly, but no rush.

44
00:04:09,684 --> 00:04:11,468
Yes. Of course. Like this. Yeah?

45
00:04:11,642 --> 00:04:12,643
Yes.Try.

46
00:04:14,689 --> 00:04:16,560
Faster. As fast as you can.

47
00:04:16,734 --> 00:04:17,953
Sorry.

48
00:04:18,127 --> 00:04:20,129
Don't apologize. Just practice.

49
00:04:20,303 --> 00:04:22,349
Good. Good.

50
00:04:22,523 --> 00:04:24,873
Practice until
you can do it in your sleep.

51
00:04:30,139 --> 00:04:33,795
Good evening, Chef. Good evening, husband.

52
00:04:33,969 --> 00:04:35,666
I told him not to.

53
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:37,059
[Sebastian]
You must be lost, Ray.

54
00:04:37,233 --> 00:04:38,147
The bar is in front.

55
00:04:38,321 --> 00:04:39,540
Aren't you funny?

56
00:04:39,714 --> 00:04:41,281
You must be the first
Frenchman in history

57
00:04:41,455 --> 00:04:43,065
not to back down from a fight.

58
00:04:43,239 --> 00:04:45,546
Okay, that's enough.
Back to work.

59
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:48,113
Et toi, ma chérie. You're fired.

60
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:49,898
You can't fire the owner.

61
00:04:50,072 --> 00:04:53,162
Half owner, and this
half is mine, so out.

62
00:04:53,336 --> 00:04:54,685
I come bearing gifts.

63
00:04:54,859 --> 00:04:56,470
No.
Put it in the freezer. No, no...

64
00:04:56,644 --> 00:04:57,819
That's your answer
for everything.

65
00:04:57,993 --> 00:04:59,342
I think you better
take a look at this.

66
00:05:09,134 --> 00:05:10,527
It's nice, isn't it?

67
00:05:10,701 --> 00:05:12,312
How... How did you do this?

68
00:05:12,486 --> 00:05:14,488
You have your talents,
I have mine.

69
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:18,579
You better be ready
to get real busy.

70
00:05:20,015 --> 00:05:20,755
Well done, Ray.

71
00:05:20,929 --> 00:05:22,626
Oh, thanks, Frenchman.

72
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:25,150
Coming from you,
that's a... a compliment.

73
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:28,023
Come on. You gotta go show
your face to the hungry people.

74
00:05:28,197 --> 00:05:29,372
Oh, no, no, no, darling.
I'm busy.

75
00:05:29,546 --> 00:05:31,113
Look, I'm preparing the...

76
00:05:31,287 --> 00:05:33,289
Hey, I've been bragging
about you all night out there.

77
00:05:33,463 --> 00:05:34,899
If you don't come with me
and show your face,

78
00:05:35,073 --> 00:05:36,553
they're gonna think
I'm a loser. Come on.

79
00:05:36,727 --> 00:05:38,686
You know I prefer
the kitchen, not...

80
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:39,948
I know, the spotlight.

81
00:05:40,122 --> 00:05:42,603
But you gotta meet
the hungry people.

82
00:05:42,777 --> 00:05:45,649
[Ray chuckles] So
this Parisian chef says,

83
00:05:45,823 --> 00:05:48,130
"If you don't come back
with 50 pounds of salmon,

84
00:05:48,304 --> 00:05:50,350
you're gonna have a hundred
pounds of pissed-off Russian."

85
00:05:50,524 --> 00:05:52,047
[laughter]

86
00:05:52,221 --> 00:05:54,005
[Ray] So I said, "Tell me more."

87
00:05:54,179 --> 00:05:55,877
And that's how I met my wife.

88
00:05:56,051 --> 00:05:57,313
There you have it.

89
00:05:57,487 --> 00:06:00,664
Set up on a blind date
by a dead fish. Enjoy.

90
00:06:00,838 --> 00:06:01,926
[patron chuckling]

91
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:03,188
[chef shouting in French]

92
00:06:03,363 --> 00:06:04,755
[kitchen staff shouting]

93
00:06:04,929 --> 00:06:06,366
[alarm beeping][chef]
Get the back door open.

94
00:06:06,540 --> 00:06:07,758
[Sebastian] Open the back door!

95
00:06:07,932 --> 00:06:09,934
Out of the way! Idiot!

96
00:06:10,108 --> 00:06:11,066
What's going on?

97
00:06:11,849 --> 00:06:13,285
What's happening here, guys?

98
00:06:15,157 --> 00:06:16,114
What's happening?

99
00:06:16,288 --> 00:06:17,681
Back to work, all of you!

100
00:06:17,855 --> 00:06:19,248
The first night,
and we're messing it all up!

101
00:06:19,422 --> 00:06:20,641
[host] Chef.Yes.

102
00:06:20,815 --> 00:06:23,165
[phone ringing]Uh, phone for you.

103
00:06:23,339 --> 00:06:24,384
Sebastian, come on.

104
00:06:24,558 --> 00:06:25,733
Try not to burn
the kitchen down.

105
00:06:25,907 --> 00:06:27,474
It's the first day.

106
00:06:27,648 --> 00:06:30,128
Hello? Hello?

107
00:06:30,302 --> 00:06:32,348
[person on phone
speaking Russian]

108
00:06:34,219 --> 00:06:35,307
[speaking Russian]

109
00:06:36,526 --> 00:06:38,223
[person speaking Russian]

110
00:06:42,097 --> 00:06:43,577
Everything all right, Chef?

111
00:06:43,751 --> 00:06:45,666
Huh? Yes. Yes.

112
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:47,668
Everything's fine.

113
00:06:47,842 --> 00:06:51,019
As long as the restaurant
doesn't burn, we're good.

114
00:06:51,193 --> 00:06:52,760
Let's get back to work. Come on.

115
00:06:52,934 --> 00:06:54,631
Oui, Chef.

116
00:06:54,805 --> 00:06:55,806
Imbeciles!

117
00:06:56,894 --> 00:06:58,679
Back to work, all of you.

118
00:06:58,853 --> 00:07:00,724
I'm gonna go out
on the sidewalk,

119
00:07:00,898 --> 00:07:03,423
tell the waiters that it's
safe to come back in.

120
00:07:05,468 --> 00:07:09,080
I am so sorry, ma'am.
We are all booked for tonight.

121
00:07:09,254 --> 00:07:12,301
[chuckles] I'm telling
you, Paris was insane.

122
00:07:12,475 --> 00:07:13,694
We'd walk out of the clubs,

123
00:07:13,868 --> 00:07:15,739
we'd all be drunk
and stumbling around.

124
00:07:15,913 --> 00:07:18,568
I mean, it was one party
right after another.

125
00:07:18,742 --> 00:07:20,440
Richard, it's getting late.

126
00:07:21,571 --> 00:07:22,790
Well, thanks for the drink, Ray.

127
00:07:22,964 --> 00:07:24,313
Ah, pleasure. Nice to meet you.

128
00:07:24,487 --> 00:07:26,228
Ah, look after yourself.

129
00:07:27,185 --> 00:07:28,796
We have reached
our turnover early.

130
00:07:28,970 --> 00:07:30,275
Can I start taking walk-ins?

131
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:31,973
No. No walk-ins.

132
00:07:32,147 --> 00:07:34,366
I'd rather be in the red
than to take walk-ins.

133
00:07:34,541 --> 00:07:35,759
Fully booked.

134
00:07:35,933 --> 00:07:37,065
That's what we show
the world tonight.

135
00:07:37,239 --> 00:07:38,545
Okay, I'll turn away
this two-top.

136
00:07:38,719 --> 00:07:40,677
Ah, ah, ah, ah. Guests.

137
00:07:40,851 --> 00:07:42,679
Not a two-top, not a four-top.

138
00:07:42,853 --> 00:07:44,333
We're not an Applebee's.

139
00:07:44,507 --> 00:07:45,856
You're in the big leagues now.

140
00:07:46,030 --> 00:07:47,336
My fault.

141
00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:49,120
Guests, right.

142
00:07:49,294 --> 00:07:50,470
I'll take care of these two.

143
00:07:53,429 --> 00:07:56,345
Why don't you get drinks for
that two-top you just seated?

144
00:08:00,175 --> 00:08:01,742
Ray, you handsome devil.

145
00:08:01,916 --> 00:08:02,873
[chuckles]

146
00:08:03,744 --> 00:08:05,354
I mean, this place is...

147
00:08:05,528 --> 00:08:06,529
Wow.

148
00:08:07,356 --> 00:08:08,400
Thanks, Mickey.

149
00:08:09,358 --> 00:08:10,402
What's up, fellas?

150
00:08:12,448 --> 00:08:13,971
We're starving.

151
00:08:14,145 --> 00:08:15,799
[Ray] Just have your
mama cook for you.

152
00:08:15,973 --> 00:08:17,061
That's fucked up.[laughing]

153
00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:23,415
[chuckles] You know, my
mother's dead, God rest her soul.

154
00:08:24,416 --> 00:08:25,592
What do you want?

155
00:08:28,159 --> 00:08:30,074
Dom wants to talk.

156
00:08:30,248 --> 00:08:31,685
Tell him I'll call him
in the morning.

157
00:08:31,859 --> 00:08:33,251
That's not gonna work.

158
00:08:34,775 --> 00:08:36,733
Come on, bozo. Look around.

159
00:08:36,907 --> 00:08:39,040
We're busy. It's a bad time.

160
00:08:40,432 --> 00:08:41,869
He wants to talk now.

161
00:08:45,394 --> 00:08:47,309
Just tell him I'll call him
in the morning.

162
00:08:47,483 --> 00:08:49,616
Yeah, he's not gonna do that.

163
00:08:53,054 --> 00:08:54,621
Come on. We're friends.

164
00:08:54,795 --> 00:08:57,928
I'll talk to him,
and it'll all work out.

165
00:08:58,102 --> 00:08:59,451
It's tonight, Ray.

166
00:09:02,150 --> 00:09:03,934
Mickey. Come on, man.

167
00:09:04,108 --> 00:09:05,240
It's opening night.

168
00:09:05,414 --> 00:09:07,503
[Ray laughs]It's opening night.

169
00:09:09,157 --> 00:09:12,029
I don't give a shit
if it's opening night.

170
00:09:12,203 --> 00:09:13,117
Listen to me.

171
00:09:13,291 --> 00:09:15,250
It's tonight.

172
00:09:15,424 --> 00:09:19,689
Dom told me tonight.
I told you it's tonight.

173
00:09:19,863 --> 00:09:22,910
And you always do what Daddy
tells you to do, don't you?

174
00:09:25,782 --> 00:09:27,828
I'm next in line, Ray.
Show a little respect.

175
00:09:28,002 --> 00:09:29,830
Respect is earned.

176
00:09:38,490 --> 00:09:39,796
I'll talk to him in the morning.

177
00:09:39,970 --> 00:09:42,103
We'll work it out. Don't worry.

178
00:09:44,192 --> 00:09:45,585
Tonight, Ray.

179
00:09:50,372 --> 00:09:51,765
Let's get outta here.

180

00:09:59,337 --> 00:10:01,339
[staff] Speech, speech,
speech, speech.

183
00:10:01,513 --> 00:10:04,647
Okay. [laughs] Thank you.

184
00:10:04,821 --> 00:10:07,432
Uh, this place is what
I've always wanted,

185
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:11,132
Um, and it's thanks to you
that I stand here,

186
00:10:11,306 --> 00:10:13,656
the proud owner of Etoile Rouge.

187
00:10:13,830 --> 00:10:15,092
Half owner. [chuckles]

188
00:10:15,266 --> 00:10:16,790
This is a special night.

189
00:10:18,530 --> 00:10:21,098
And hopefully
just the beginning.

190
00:10:22,317 --> 00:10:24,667
And, yeah, thank you, guys.

191
00:10:24,841 --> 00:10:28,323
Thank you for not fucking it up.

192
00:10:28,497 --> 00:10:30,934
[staff chuckles][speaking Russian]

193
00:10:31,935 --> 00:10:33,763
So let's celebrate.

194
00:10:33,937 --> 00:10:36,418
That is all,
ladies and gentlemen.

195
00:10:36,592 --> 00:10:39,551
The kitchen is now closed.
Let's drink.

196
00:10:39,726 --> 00:10:41,031
[staff whoop] Na zdorovie.

197
00:10:44,034 --> 00:10:46,733
Hey, boss, are we gonna
do this or what?

198
00:10:52,695 --> 00:10:54,915
I left my dad a message.

199
00:10:55,089 --> 00:10:57,526
We're not doing nothing
till he gets back to me.

200
00:10:58,614 --> 00:11:00,137
He did say it was tonight.

201
00:11:03,227 --> 00:11:04,359
Yeah.

202
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:06,666
I know what he said.

203
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:09,756
He said it to me, genius.
I told you that.

204
00:11:11,192 --> 00:11:12,628
I'm just saying.

205
00:11:14,412 --> 00:11:15,413
[henchman 1] So...

206
00:11:17,633 --> 00:11:19,200
we're just gonna wait here?

207
00:11:19,374 --> 00:11:22,682
Did I fucking stutter? Huh?

208
00:11:26,381 --> 00:11:27,904
He's getting a massage,

209
00:11:28,078 --> 00:11:29,819
and when he's getting a massage,

210
00:11:29,993 --> 00:11:31,647
he don't like to be bothered.

211
00:11:34,128 --> 00:11:35,346
It ruins the mood.

212
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:40,003
[henchman 2] I never
got a massage before.

213
00:11:40,177 --> 00:11:42,614
You gotta do those things naked?

214
00:11:44,442 --> 00:11:47,010
Why the fuck would you go naked?

215
00:11:47,881 --> 00:11:49,186
I heard you gotta do it naked.

216
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:51,493
Just shut up. Everybody shut up.

217
00:11:53,321 --> 00:11:56,324
And get off the fucking car.
I just had it washed.

218
00:12:00,676 --> 00:12:03,505
[henchman 2] That Ray.
Some balls on that guy, huh?

219
00:12:04,593 --> 00:12:07,291
Yeah. Not for long.

220
00:12:07,465 --> 00:12:08,771
[henchman 2 chuckles] Yeah.

221
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:11,252
I'd like to see that.

222
00:12:13,297 --> 00:12:15,386
Oh, you're gonna see
something, lollipop.

223
00:12:16,561 --> 00:12:18,825
[henchman 2]
Okay, we'll see. Yeah, lollipop.

224

226

[exhales] It's disgusting.

227
00:12:32,403 --> 00:12:33,448
How does it feel?

228
00:12:34,362 --> 00:12:35,276
What do you mean?

229
00:12:35,450 --> 00:12:37,017
To have your own place.

230
00:12:37,191 --> 00:12:38,932
Yeah, it feels good. Um...

231
00:12:39,933 --> 00:12:41,456
A little stressful.

232
00:12:41,630 --> 00:12:43,110
Ay, caramba.

233
00:12:43,284 --> 00:12:45,025
You did it, Ana.

234
00:12:45,199 --> 00:12:48,419
I know you can't tell
right now, but you did it.

235
00:12:48,593 --> 00:12:49,943
This is the start of something...

236
00:12:50,117 --> 00:12:51,509
[stomach grumbles] CÇa va, Sebastian?

237

239
00:12:59,735 --> 00:13:02,782
So... [chuckles] did you
always wanna be a chef?

240
00:13:04,435 --> 00:13:06,829
No. Not always, no.

241
00:13:08,744 --> 00:13:11,486
Well, you're really good at it.

242
00:13:13,009 --> 00:13:13,967
Thank you.

243
00:13:14,924 --> 00:13:16,578
You know, it's not just me.

244
00:13:16,752 --> 00:13:18,493
Ray has done so much for me.

245
00:13:18,667 --> 00:13:19,799
Mmm.

246
00:13:21,322 --> 00:13:24,978
And I'm sure
he's somewhere here,

247
00:13:25,152 --> 00:13:27,241
supporting me, right?

248
00:13:28,938 --> 00:13:32,594
[sniffing] Whoa. That's
some pretty good stuff, Ricky.

249
00:13:32,768 --> 00:13:34,335
All right. I got a second wind.

250
00:13:34,509 --> 00:13:35,945
Let's go.

251
00:13:36,119 --> 00:13:37,904
I think we gotta get home.
It's getting late.

252
00:13:38,078 --> 00:13:40,167
Aw, come on.
We just got started, man.

253
00:13:40,341 --> 00:13:41,777
Well, I'm out of money.

254
00:13:41,951 --> 00:13:44,780
Here. Problem solved. [chuckles]

255
00:13:44,954 --> 00:13:47,087
Sorry, Ray. We gotta get going.

256
00:13:47,261 --> 00:13:48,958
[Ana] Party's over.

257
00:13:49,132 --> 00:13:51,308
Give them their tips back
and go home.

258
00:13:52,222 --> 00:13:54,137
[Ray] There you go, guys.

259
00:13:54,311 --> 00:13:56,400
Leave me enough
for cab fare, will you?

260
00:13:56,574 --> 00:13:58,011
And I mean you too, huh?

261
00:13:59,186 --> 00:14:00,927
Wanna play a game,
just you and me?

262
00:14:01,101 --> 00:14:02,885
Well, you know, I gotta work.

263
00:14:03,059 --> 00:14:05,105
I need to prepare
demiglace for tomorrow.

264
00:14:05,888 --> 00:14:06,933
You never stop.

265
00:14:07,934 --> 00:14:09,370
All right.
I'll see you when I see you.

266
00:14:09,544 --> 00:14:11,198
Mm-hmm. Beso.

267
00:14:11,372 --> 00:14:13,156
Don't be all night.Mmm.

268
00:14:13,330 --> 00:14:14,592
Good night.

269
00:14:14,766 --> 00:14:16,029
I'll walk you out.

270
00:14:16,203 --> 00:14:17,682
Eliza, how did we do?

271
00:14:17,857 --> 00:14:20,598
Everything was great.
Cash till looks promising.

272
00:14:20,772 --> 00:14:21,948
Great. Thank you.

273
00:14:22,122 --> 00:14:23,601
[Eliza] You're staying?

274
00:14:23,775 --> 00:14:26,822
Oh, she's gonna smoke
and pace and pace and smoke.

275
00:14:26,996 --> 00:14:28,693
She gets all jacked up
on the adrenaline.

276
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:30,957
Mm-hmm. Well, at least
that's all I'm jacked up on.

277
00:14:31,131 --> 00:14:32,132
[Ray laughs][Eliza] Oh.

278
00:14:32,306 --> 00:14:33,829

[Mickey] Look who it is. Oh, shit.

285
00:15:17,829 --> 00:15:19,440
Aren't those the two guys
for the restaurant?

286
00:15:19,614 --> 00:15:22,573
A legend. Who's the hooker?

287
00:15:24,358 --> 00:15:26,186
Isn't it past
your bedtime, Mickey?

288
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:28,536
[chuckles] Now, why you
gotta be crazy like that?

289
00:15:28,710 --> 00:15:30,190
I let you have
your big night out.

290
00:15:30,364 --> 00:15:32,453
Now, come on. I've had
it up to here with you.

291
00:15:32,627 --> 00:15:33,976
Come on. Go home.

292

293
00:15:36,152 --> 00:15:37,980
I'll work something out.

294
00:15:38,154 --> 00:15:40,983
Well, he sent me to handle it.

295
00:15:43,507 --> 00:15:44,987
So I'm handling it.

You know, I think
all of this Viagra

301
00:16:03,136 --> 00:16:05,486
has caused you
some serious hearing loss.

302
00:16:06,661 --> 00:16:08,924
It's tonight, lollipop.

303
00:16:09,098 --> 00:16:10,926
Yeah. All right, Mickey.
Whatever you say.

304
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:12,493
What are they talking about? Nothing.

305

They're talking about nothing.
They just talk.

306
00:16:22,198 --> 00:16:23,112

00:20:34,494 --> 00:20:36,713
Put my husband on the phone.

359
00:20:36,887 --> 00:20:38,019
Or what?

360
00:20:40,543 --> 00:20:43,329
I'm not a person
you wanna fuck with.

361
00:20:43,503 --> 00:20:45,200
[laughs]

362
00:20:45,374 --> 00:20:47,594
Then you're not gonna like
what we did to your restaurant.

363
00:20:47,768 --> 00:20:49,335
What did you do
to my restaurant?

364
00:20:49,509 --> 00:20:51,598
[laughs] It's in flames.

365
00:20:51,772 --> 00:20:55,689
Big, bright, orange,
gorgeous flames.

366
00:20:55,863 --> 00:20:56,994
Oh, is it?

367
00:21:02,870 --> 00:21:04,611
Listen to me.

368
00:21:04,785 --> 00:21:07,570
You better get out of there right
now before we torch the place,

369
00:21:07,744 --> 00:21:10,878
or your opening night
is gonna be your last night.

370
00:21:12,009 --> 00:21:13,184
I doubt it.

371
00:21:16,231 --> 00:21:19,843
[shouts] She hung up on me, Ray!

372
00:21:23,325 --> 00:21:24,413
Shit.

373
00:21:27,503 --> 00:21:28,591
[door latch opens]

374
00:21:38,384 --> 00:21:39,298
Ana.

375
00:21:39,472 --> 00:21:41,212
Oh, honey.

376
00:21:42,083 --> 00:21:44,085
[sighs]Thank God you're okay.

377
00:21:45,608 --> 00:21:46,870
Is that a gun?

378
00:21:47,044 --> 00:21:49,308
Oh, just for emergencies.
Don't worry.

379
00:21:50,787 --> 00:21:52,702
What... Where did you get a gun?

380
00:21:54,138 --> 00:21:55,357
I had it. [chuckles]

381
00:21:55,531 --> 00:21:57,185
Is that blood?

382
00:21:57,359 --> 00:22:00,014
Yeah, but... What the fuck is going on?

383
00:22:00,188 --> 00:22:01,798
Stay calm. Calm. Whose blood is that?

384
00:22:01,972 --> 00:22:03,452
No, don't... don't
open the door, Ray. Don't...

385
00:22:05,976 --> 00:22:07,326
Oh, fuck.

386
00:22:08,979 --> 00:22:10,329
Oh, fuck.

387
00:22:11,721 --> 00:22:13,114
Dom is gonna kill me.

388
00:22:14,289 --> 00:22:15,682
Who? Who's Dom?[sighs]

389
00:22:17,248 --> 00:22:18,337
A bad man.

390
00:22:21,731 --> 00:22:23,124
Why is he gonna kill you?

391
00:22:27,346 --> 00:22:28,434
Ray!

392
00:22:28,608 --> 00:22:30,871
Sorry, I-I-I didn't know.

393
00:22:31,611 --> 00:22:33,221
You didn't know what?

394
00:22:35,876 --> 00:22:37,312
I thought
there would be more time.

395
00:22:37,486 --> 00:22:39,227
I didn't know
it was gonna be tonight.

396
00:22:39,401 --> 00:22:41,621
Ray, what did you do?

397
00:22:43,623 --> 00:22:45,276
[sighs]

398
00:22:46,843 --> 00:22:48,105
I fucked up.

399
00:22:50,194 --> 00:22:51,848
I owe a lot of money,

400
00:22:52,022 --> 00:22:54,242
and I thought
I could pay it back,

401
00:22:54,416 --> 00:22:56,853
you know, when the
restaurant got successful.

402
00:22:59,552 --> 00:23:01,380
How much do you owe?

403
00:23:03,251 --> 00:23:04,383
A lot.

404
00:23:05,122 --> 00:23:06,559
How much, Ray?

405
00:23:08,169 --> 00:23:09,649
1.2.

406
00:23:11,607 --> 00:23:14,088
[scoffs] Million?

407
00:23:15,132 --> 00:23:17,004
1.3 if you round.

408
00:23:17,178 --> 00:23:19,310
Oh, God. All right.

409
00:23:19,485 --> 00:23:20,790
Get a little deeper there.

410
00:23:20,964 --> 00:23:23,010
Yeah. Oh, shit.

411
00:23:23,184 --> 00:23:24,315
Not that deep.

412
00:23:24,490 --> 00:23:27,362
Oh, goddamn, Gary.

413
00:23:28,842 --> 00:23:32,149
[phone ringing][groans] Who the fuck?

414
00:23:33,412 --> 00:23:35,979
Get that, will you, Gar? Yes, sir.

415
00:23:36,632 --> 00:23:38,068
What?

416
00:23:38,242 --> 00:23:40,723
Sorry to bother you, Pops.
I know it ruins the mood.

417
00:23:40,897 --> 00:23:43,247
Get to the point.

418
00:23:43,422 --> 00:23:45,902
Well, we got a little
situation going on.

419
00:23:47,034 --> 00:23:48,731
And you can't handle it?

420
00:23:48,905 --> 00:23:52,996
I can. I just wanted to, you
know, make you awares, check-in.

421
00:23:53,170 --> 00:23:54,433
[Dom sighs]

422
00:23:55,608 --> 00:23:58,045
This wasn't supposed
to be difficult, Mick.

423
00:23:58,219 --> 00:24:00,090
That's why I sent you
to take care of it.

424
00:24:02,049 --> 00:24:03,833
I am taking care of it.

425
00:24:04,007 --> 00:24:05,922
Oh, not that, Gary.
Not that deep.

426
00:24:06,096 --> 00:24:07,707
Son of a bitch.

427
00:24:07,881 --> 00:24:09,012
If you were taking care of it,

428
00:24:09,186 --> 00:24:10,753
we wouldn't be talking
right now.

429
00:24:11,624 --> 00:24:13,887
[sniffles] Look, Dad...

430
00:24:16,803 --> 00:24:18,848
Can you just send me
a couple more guys?

431
00:24:19,022 --> 00:24:21,329
What happened to
the guys that you had?

432
00:24:21,503 --> 00:24:24,898
Gio and the pip-squeak,
what's-his-name.

433
00:24:25,072 --> 00:24:27,770
You know that jerk, Ray, he
really fucked us on this one, Dad.

434
00:24:28,684 --> 00:24:29,685
What?

435
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:33,472
Oh, goddamn! Oh, sorry. Okay.

436
00:24:33,646 --> 00:24:34,951
Put him on.

437
00:24:36,039 --> 00:24:37,127
Can't do that.

438
00:24:38,825 --> 00:24:39,826
Why not?

439
00:24:40,740 --> 00:24:41,915
'Cause he's inside,

440
00:24:42,089 --> 00:24:43,612
holed up with that Russian lady.

441
00:24:43,786 --> 00:24:45,266
I gotta tell you,
I don't like her one bit.

442
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:47,486
[sighs] I'm on my way. No, no, no.

443
00:24:47,660 --> 00:24:48,835
Just... Just... Just send...

444
00:24:49,009 --> 00:24:50,750
Jesus, man.

445
00:24:50,924 --> 00:24:52,752
Let this be
a lesson to you, Gary.

446
00:24:52,926 --> 00:24:54,493
If you ever want
something done right,

447
00:24:54,667 --> 00:24:57,147
don't ask your jerk-off son
to do it for you.

448
00:24:59,585 --> 00:25:01,717
I'm still on the line, Dad.

449
00:25:01,891 --> 00:25:04,503
Then hang the fuck up, idiot.

450
00:25:04,677 --> 00:25:05,765
[line beeps]

451
00:25:11,205 --> 00:25:13,207
[crying, sniffling]

452
00:25:23,391 --> 00:25:25,611
[Ana] Ray, what did you do?

453
00:25:25,785 --> 00:25:26,829
[sighs]

454
00:25:27,003 --> 00:25:28,222
They wanna burn down
the restaurant

455
00:25:28,396 --> 00:25:30,267
for the insurance money.

456
00:25:30,441 --> 00:25:32,095
And you're okay with that?

457
00:25:32,269 --> 00:25:35,664
No. Fuck no, I'm not
okay... I don't have a choice.

458
00:25:35,838 --> 00:25:38,101
Please tell me
it wasn't your idea.

459
00:25:38,275 --> 00:25:40,147
No, it wasn't.

460
00:25:40,321 --> 00:25:43,193
Maybe... Maybe a little.

461
00:25:44,412 --> 00:25:45,500
But, Ana,

462
00:25:47,023 --> 00:25:49,286
I really believed that we
could make this place work.

463
00:25:49,460 --> 00:25:51,724
It would've been great. "Would have been"?

464
00:25:51,898 --> 00:25:53,203
[laughs]

465
00:25:53,377 --> 00:25:55,597
You're giving up already?
That's it?

466
00:25:58,992 --> 00:26:00,297
Sweetheart,
we don't have a choice.

467
00:26:00,471 --> 00:26:02,169
No, you don't have a choice.

468
00:26:02,343 --> 00:26:05,302
[scoffs] You're so
fucking irresponsible.

469
00:26:05,476 --> 00:26:06,826
[sighs] I'm sorry.

470
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,349
Not sorry enough.

471
00:26:10,133 --> 00:26:11,482
What if... Shut up!

472
00:26:15,312 --> 00:26:17,271
No wonder
you've been divorced twice.

473
00:26:17,445 --> 00:26:18,794
Now I get it.

474
00:26:21,231 --> 00:26:23,712
That's a little below
the belt, don't you think?

475
00:26:28,499 --> 00:26:30,153
I fucked up,

476
00:26:30,327 --> 00:26:31,590
but I love you.

477
00:26:32,373 --> 00:26:33,766
I truly love you.

478
00:26:35,289 --> 00:26:37,639
And if I could go back
and change all of this,

479
00:26:37,813 --> 00:26:39,946
I would do it in a nanosecond.

480
00:26:41,730 --> 00:26:44,515
Well, you can't,
and you lied to me.

481
00:26:47,997 --> 00:26:49,259
What about you?

482
00:26:49,433 --> 00:26:50,739
What about... What about this?

483
00:26:50,913 --> 00:26:53,002
What... What about them?
Did you kill 'em?

484
00:26:56,789 --> 00:26:58,399
You really wanna know?

485
00:27:06,886 --> 00:27:09,584
Ana, talk to me.[sighs, scoffs]

486
00:27:11,542 --> 00:27:12,674
I, uh...

487
00:27:17,374 --> 00:27:19,550
I used to work for the KGB.

488
00:27:21,248 --> 00:27:23,816
Like Russian KGB?

489
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:28,342
Yes.

490
00:27:32,389 --> 00:27:33,521
You're a spy.

491
00:27:36,002 --> 00:27:37,264
I'm a chef.

492
00:27:42,399 --> 00:27:43,662
Wait, wait.

493
00:27:45,272 --> 00:27:48,579
I mean, that's not something
that you just walk away from.

494
00:27:48,754 --> 00:27:50,886
How did you get out? I managed.

495
00:27:51,060 --> 00:27:52,148
I disappeared,

496
00:27:52,322 --> 00:27:53,759
until you fucking
put me on the map

497
00:27:53,933 --> 00:27:55,369
with that stupid announcement.

498
00:27:55,543 --> 00:27:58,546
How was I supposed to know
that you were fucking KGB?

499
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:00,330
No, ex-KGB.

500
00:28:00,504 --> 00:28:01,810
All right, so what now?

501
00:28:03,638 --> 00:28:05,161
Is the KGB gonna come after you?

502
00:28:05,335 --> 00:28:06,380
No.

503
00:28:07,555 --> 00:28:08,599
Maybe.

504
00:28:11,777 --> 00:28:12,952
[chuckles]

505
00:28:14,475 --> 00:28:16,564
So I guess we're both
full of shit.

506
00:28:16,738 --> 00:28:18,392
No, except I lied
to protect you.

507
00:28:18,566 --> 00:28:20,960
No, you lied to protect you.

508
00:28:21,134 --> 00:28:22,222
What the fuck do you know?

509
00:28:36,279 --> 00:28:38,281
Don't be mad. Don't be mad.
Don't be mad.

510
00:28:38,455 --> 00:28:39,979
I can fix this.

511
00:28:40,153 --> 00:28:41,632
Why am I here, then,

512
00:28:41,807 --> 00:28:44,331
when I should be getting
a fucking massage?

513
00:28:44,505 --> 00:28:46,507
I got a plan. You got a plan?

514
00:28:46,681 --> 00:28:49,336
The only plan you got is
I got a plan.

515
00:28:49,510 --> 00:28:53,906
A Russian problem calls for
a Russian solution, right?

516
00:28:59,738 --> 00:29:00,956
You had your chance, Mickey.

517
00:29:01,130 --> 00:29:04,177
Leo, Tommy, Billy, let's go.

518
00:29:04,351 --> 00:29:06,614
I did what I had to.
I had no choice!

519
00:29:06,788 --> 00:29:08,268
Welcome to the fucking club.

520
00:29:08,442 --> 00:29:10,096
That's not the same thing.

521
00:29:10,270 --> 00:29:12,185
It is exactly
the same fucking thing.

522
00:29:12,359 --> 00:29:15,188
I tried so hard to get rid
of one thing in my life,

523
00:29:15,362 --> 00:29:17,016
and here you are, fucking it up

524
00:29:17,190 --> 00:29:18,887
like you fucked up
everything else.

525
00:29:20,454 --> 00:29:21,585
I can fix this.

526
00:29:23,196 --> 00:29:24,501
Let me talk to them.

527
00:29:24,675 --> 00:29:26,547
Talk to him? [scoffs]
Talking will do nothing.

528
00:29:28,201 --> 00:29:29,985
You don't know these guys.

529
00:29:30,159 --> 00:29:32,596
They're not gonna
walk away from this.

530
00:29:32,771 --> 00:29:35,861
There's a lot of money on the
line, and there's a lot of them.

531
00:29:36,687 --> 00:29:38,124
I don't care.

532
00:29:38,298 --> 00:29:40,517
Dom is not somebody
you wanna fuck with.

533
00:29:44,695 --> 00:29:46,567
I'm not somebody
you wanna fuck with.

534
00:29:46,741 --> 00:29:48,351
Let me talk to them.

535
00:29:48,525 --> 00:29:51,224
He needs me alive.
He's not gonna kill me.

536
00:29:51,398 --> 00:29:52,834
He needs me breathing

537
00:29:53,008 --> 00:29:55,881
so he can collect on
the insurance money.

538
00:29:56,055 --> 00:29:58,579
I can reason with him.
He's a reasonable guy.

539
00:29:58,753 --> 00:30:00,711
He's a reason... Did he just
say he's a reasonable guy?

540
00:30:00,886 --> 00:30:02,583
Oh, no, no. Did you just say
he's a reasonable guy?

541
00:30:02,757 --> 00:30:03,889
No, we're not going
down that road.

542
00:30:04,063 --> 00:30:05,412
No, wait, wait.
You like that word.

543
00:30:05,586 --> 00:30:06,630
We're not going down...
You like that word.

544
00:30:06,805 --> 00:30:07,936
No, we're not doing...

545
00:30:08,110 --> 00:30:09,808
You call me unreasonable
all the time!

546
00:30:11,461 --> 00:30:13,028
And what do I do?

547
00:30:13,202 --> 00:30:14,334
I cook.

548
00:30:15,596 --> 00:30:17,076
Sometimes I shout.

549
00:30:17,990 --> 00:30:20,340
And that makes me unreasonable?

550
00:30:20,514 --> 00:30:26,041
This guy wants to burn down a perfectly good
restaurant, and he's the reasonable one.

551
00:30:27,303 --> 00:30:28,914
That's not what I'm saying.

552
00:30:29,871 --> 00:30:32,178
No? No, we're on the same team.

553
00:30:32,352 --> 00:30:34,180
No, we are not on the same team.

554
00:30:35,181 --> 00:30:37,139
You want to talk to people

555
00:30:37,313 --> 00:30:39,576
that want to
burn this place down.

556
00:30:39,750 --> 00:30:42,188
And what do you wanna do?
You wanna kill 'em?

557
00:30:45,234 --> 00:30:48,324
I won't let them
burn down my restaurant.

558
00:30:49,630 --> 00:30:51,197
Our restaurant?

559
00:30:53,547 --> 00:30:54,722
I'll talk to them.

560
00:30:56,289 --> 00:30:57,986
It's the only way.

561
00:31:00,859 --> 00:31:02,861
[Ray] If you're not gonna
be reasonable, I will.

562
00:31:06,212 --> 00:31:07,256
[Ray] Dom!

563
00:31:08,692 --> 00:31:09,955
I just wanna talk.

564
00:31:25,796 --> 00:31:27,450
What's going on, Ray?

565
00:31:28,582 --> 00:31:30,801
You can't burn it down. Not yet.

566
00:31:32,542 --> 00:31:33,587
Why is that?

567
00:31:34,893 --> 00:31:38,070
Give us a chance to
really make it work, please.

568
00:31:38,244 --> 00:31:40,115
I got a good feeling
about this place.

569
00:31:40,289 --> 00:31:41,987
And you had a good feeling about

570
00:31:42,161 --> 00:31:44,119
the last four restaurants too.
Do you remember that?

571
00:31:44,293 --> 00:31:46,600
Yeah, I know, I know,
but this one's different.

572
00:31:47,514 --> 00:31:48,776
It's not working for me, Ray.

573
00:31:49,951 --> 00:31:52,606
Is that all you got
is a good feeling?

574
00:31:52,780 --> 00:31:54,434
Come on, don't bust my balls.

575
00:31:54,608 --> 00:31:57,480
All right, look. I got a
really good feeling. All right?

576
00:31:57,654 --> 00:31:59,221
Is that... Does that work?

577
00:31:59,395 --> 00:32:01,571
Doesn't mean much
coming from you.

578
00:32:05,184 --> 00:32:06,359
Dom, please.

579
00:32:07,403 --> 00:32:08,404
Ray...

580
00:32:09,101 --> 00:32:10,885
take solace in the fact

581
00:32:11,059 --> 00:32:14,149
that you didn't run this one
into the ground.

582
00:32:16,586 --> 00:32:17,805
You burned it.

Enough bullshit.
Mickey, you're up.

589
00:32:50,881 --> 00:32:52,796
Burn this place to the ground.

590

Ana, is that you?

Yes.

598
00:33:48,026 --> 00:33:49,636
How are you?

you call me to bail you out?

[chuckles] Yes.

605
00:34:09,395 --> 00:34:10,874
Hmm. So you need my help.

606
00:34:13,355 --> 00:34:16,663
There are some men trying
to burn down my restaurant.

607
00:34:17,490 --> 00:34:20,623
Oh, no. On opening night?

608
00:34:21,450 --> 00:34:22,538
Yeah.

609
00:34:22,712 --> 00:34:23,539
Well, that's just rude.

How many are we talking?

611
00:34:25,672 --> 00:34:27,543
[sighs] Not sure yet.

612
00:34:28,414 --> 00:34:29,806
But can you help?

613
00:34:31,982 --> 00:34:33,941
Well, what choice
do I have, Ana?

614
00:34:34,115 --> 00:34:36,900
If you're calling me, I'm
guessing it's an emergency, right?

615
00:34:37,988 --> 00:34:39,642
It is, yeah. Um...

616
00:34:40,730 --> 00:34:41,905
Could you hurry?

I will, babe. Don't worry.

And we are friends, right?

Yeah, friends.

We'll see you soon.

You know, when I left...
No, no, no, no, no. No.

628
00:35:12,675 --> 00:35:15,330
We will chitchat all about it
when I get there, 'kay?

from my pops.[sighs]

He told you to do it.

643
00:35:46,231 --> 00:35:48,537
And I'm telling you.
It's called delegating.

644
00:35:48,711 --> 00:35:50,539
It's what leadership is.

645
00:35:50,713 --> 00:35:51,758

Are you scared?

00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:04,379
I'll tell my dad
you did a good job.

648
00:36:04,553 --> 00:36:06,642
Just do this thing.
It's gonna be huge.

you mind your own business.

713
00:40:12,932 --> 00:40:14,281
Makes three of us.

714
00:40:14,455 --> 00:40:16,501
Well, then take
some fucking initiative.

[engine revving]

716
00:40:19,025 --> 00:40:21,419
[sighs] Oh, God.

717
00:40:24,596 --> 00:40:27,816
I'm just gonna make an observation.
You're driving like a maniac.

718
00:40:27,990 --> 00:40:30,340
And I think this is a personal
vendetta against your best friend.

719
00:40:30,515 --> 00:40:32,778
Ex-best friend, current enemy.

720
00:40:34,040 --> 00:40:36,129
And will you have
my fucking back?

721
00:40:40,568 --> 00:40:41,656
It's okay, girls.

722
00:40:54,669 --> 00:40:57,193
Keep it locked up.
Keep the riffraff out.

723
00:40:57,367 --> 00:40:58,717
Shouldn't be a long night.

724
00:40:59,369 --> 00:41:00,327
Thanks for coming out.

725
00:41:00,501 --> 00:41:02,460
No sweat. You got it, boss.

726
00:41:06,681 --> 00:41:09,771
Six guys in, no guys out?

727
00:41:09,945 --> 00:41:12,644
Shit, man. Man,
this is some bullshit.

728
00:41:12,818 --> 00:41:15,124
Gary, focus, please. Man, I am focused.

729
00:41:15,298 --> 00:41:16,865
That's how
I gather myself, okay?

730
00:41:18,301 --> 00:41:19,868
I'm just a masseuse.

731
00:41:20,042 --> 00:41:21,566
I shouldn't even be here.

732
00:41:22,958 --> 00:41:24,090
Shit!

733
00:41:25,831 --> 00:41:27,528

00:41:32,664 --> 00:41:36,319
Shut up. God, please help me.

737
00:41:36,494 --> 00:41:37,973
Gary, what are you
waiting for? Let's go.

738
00:41:38,147 --> 00:41:39,932
[grunts] Ah!

739
00:41:41,368 --> 00:41:43,413
Okay, come on. Go.

740
00:41:44,589 --> 00:41:46,199
It's not locked.
You go first. You go first.

741
00:41:46,373 --> 00:41:48,201
No, get your Black ass in there.

742
00:41:48,375 --> 00:41:51,204
That's some racist shit.
You can't say that shit.

743
00:41:51,378 --> 00:41:53,293
My bad. My bad. You're right.

745
00:42:07,176 --> 00:42:08,613
I'ma go towards
the office, all right?

746

You go right there, boy.

I'm scared! Open up, man!

751
00:42:29,459 --> 00:42:31,940

00:42:51,873 --> 00:42:55,311
You better get her, Bobby!
Yeah! Whup her ass, boy!

[grunting]

759
00:43:16,115 --> 00:43:17,725
Bobby, is she dead?

760

[grunting]

761
00:43:23,644 --> 00:43:25,298

One more time.
Okay, that's just...

[shouts] Okay, look! I'm blind.

777
00:44:06,731 --> 00:44:08,950
I didn't see your face

00:44:09,124 --> 00:44:11,170
Aah! I didn't see nothing!

779

Come on. Oh, shit. Look, lady, I

786
00:44:24,966 --> 00:44:26,664
It means french fries!

Who cares about
your fucking star sign?

I have no problem
with you, Gary.

I think Dom, he's an Aquarius.
His birthday was two days ago.

796
00:44:48,511 --> 00:44:50,470
No! That's not
what I wanna know.Okay.

797
00:44:50,644 --> 00:44:53,212
Why does he wanna
burn down my restaurant?

I don't know why!
I really don't know!

because you've got
60 seconds left.

801

Okay, okay.
It's an insurance thing.

802
00:45:00,741 --> 00:45:02,700
It's very confusing, okay?
It's confusing.

803
00:45:02,874 --> 00:45:05,485
Why tonight?
Why tonight? I don't know!

804
00:45:05,659 --> 00:45:07,574
Because they got... It's a
war between the families.

805
00:45:07,748 --> 00:45:10,533
And he gotta have... He says
gotta have cash for the company.

806
00:45:10,708 --> 00:45:11,970
How many men work for him?

00:45:39,040 --> 00:45:40,825

00:45:52,053 --> 00:45:53,359
Hell, you could let me go.

826
00:45:57,929 --> 00:45:59,278
So you're a masseuse.

827
00:45:59,452 --> 00:46:01,584
Yes, I'm...
I'm a certified masseuse.

828
00:46:01,759 --> 00:46:03,499

and I can tell you need
a massage right now.

830
00:46:06,459 --> 00:46:08,504
I can put my hands on you

00:46:12,508 --> 00:46:14,336
Yes, I am a Libra.

834
00:46:14,510 --> 00:46:17,035
If you don't like that, I can
change my sign if you want to.

That mean you about to...
Some people coming in?

838
00:46:24,085 --> 00:46:26,827
It means get out of here, Gary,
before I change my mind.

839
00:46:27,959 --> 00:46:29,221

We had some calls about
some gunfire in the area.

847
00:46:57,902 --> 00:46:59,468
You know anything about that?

848
00:46:59,642 --> 00:47:02,907
Uh, we're digging up the
gas main at the restaurant.

849
00:47:03,081 --> 00:47:05,605

Yeah.

851
00:47:08,434 --> 00:47:11,829
It's a residential area.
Got a lot of busybodies.

852
00:47:12,655 --> 00:47:13,831
I'll leave you to it.

[child] Seriously,
why do we have to be here?

855
00:47:39,160 --> 00:47:41,119
[both]
Because we don't trust you.

856
00:47:46,037 --> 00:47:47,952
Hey, hey, hey. Ease up there.

[worker] It's pretty late.

863
00:48:04,055 --> 00:48:05,578
I'm pretty sure the restaurant's
not still open.

864
00:48:05,752 --> 00:48:07,928
No, no, no, I'm sure
she's there waiting for me.

865
00:48:08,102 --> 00:48:10,888
I'm sorry, ma'am, no can do.
It's just not safe.

866
00:48:11,062 --> 00:48:12,063
You're gonna have
to call your friend.

00:48:12,237 --> 00:48:14,326
Oh, dear. You can loop back aro...

The guys that just went in...

884
00:49:12,340 --> 00:49:13,776

She got Gary.

888
00:49:30,619 --> 00:49:31,794
Scratch that.

889
00:49:32,665 --> 00:49:34,710
I need 15 more.

890
00:49:34,884 --> 00:49:37,800
I don't care about the cost.
Just make it happen.

891
00:49:43,502 --> 00:49:44,807
[blows]

892
00:49:46,026 --> 00:49:48,681
[chattering on cell phone]

893
00:49:48,855 --> 00:49:50,857
[Mimi] Some time tonight
would be nice.

894
00:49:51,031 --> 00:49:53,816
I may work slowly,
but I always finish quickly.

895
00:49:54,904 --> 00:49:57,211
Oh, I know
you finish quickly, Tom.

896
00:49:59,039 --> 00:50:01,215
I won't let your stress
disrupt my peace.

897
00:50:01,389 --> 00:50:02,738
How long is this gonna take?

898
00:50:03,913 --> 00:50:05,089
I acknowledge your impatience,

899
00:50:05,263 --> 00:50:06,916
but I don't have
an answer for that.

900
00:50:08,048 --> 00:50:10,746
[chattering continues
on cell phone]

901
00:50:11,617 --> 00:50:12,618
[clears throat]

902
00:50:12,792 --> 00:50:15,751
[tuts melodically]

903
00:50:19,190 --> 00:50:21,888
So you're really gonna do
this. You're gonna kill her.

904
00:50:27,415 --> 00:50:29,461
I don't know. I don't know.

905
00:50:31,332 --> 00:50:32,942
You wanna talk about it?
I don't wanna talk about it.

906
00:50:33,117 --> 00:50:35,380
You don't wanna talk about
it. Okay, no, I understand.

907
00:50:41,647 --> 00:50:43,649
I'm really conflicted about
it. You seem conflicted.

908
00:50:43,823 --> 00:50:45,390
I am. I'm conflicted.

909
00:50:49,046 --> 00:50:50,525
You know what this
reminds me of?

910
00:50:50,699 --> 00:50:52,049
Jakarta.

911
00:50:52,223 --> 00:50:54,921
Jakarta? Jakarta was a shitfest.

912
00:50:56,401 --> 00:50:57,750
Oh, it wasn't all bad.

913
00:51:03,625 --> 00:51:04,974
Okay, but you
feel conflicted now.

914
00:51:05,149 --> 00:51:07,803
Yes, she's... my friend.

915
00:51:07,977 --> 00:51:09,457
She's your best friend. She was my friend.

916
00:51:09,631 --> 00:51:11,068
And then she completely
ditched me and abandoned me

917
00:51:11,242 --> 00:51:12,765
to become a fucking civilian.

918
00:51:12,939 --> 00:51:14,723
I know. I was like... [scoffs]

919
00:51:14,897 --> 00:51:17,857
Must've had a pretty good
reason for that, I guess, you know.

920
00:51:18,031 --> 00:51:20,555
Whose side are you on,
Tom? You know the answer.

921
00:51:20,729 --> 00:51:22,296
Do I? I hope that you do.

922
00:51:22,470 --> 00:51:25,343
I hope you do.Okay.

923
00:51:25,517 --> 00:51:28,476
I hope that you realize that this
feels like more of a conversation

924
00:51:28,650 --> 00:51:30,174
than a conflict.Conflict.

925
00:51:30,348 --> 00:51:31,479
Another fucking Gottlieb
gem. It's a good Gottlieb.

926
00:51:31,653 --> 00:51:33,220
Thanks for that.
I'm gonna kill her.

927
00:51:33,394 --> 00:51:34,656
I don't think you're
in the right mindset for this.

928
00:51:34,830 --> 00:51:36,136
I don't think killing
should be personal.

929
00:51:36,310 --> 00:51:37,877
It's like plumbing.
It's just a job.

930
00:51:38,051 --> 00:51:40,445
Okay, well then, shut up and
do your job. All right, Tom?

931
00:51:42,534 --> 00:51:44,188
Seriously, how long
is this gonna take?

932
00:51:44,362 --> 00:51:45,928
It's gonna take
what it's gonna take!

933
00:51:46,103 --> 00:51:48,017
Calm down. Calm down, Tom!

934
00:51:48,192 --> 00:51:49,193
Okay.

935
00:51:49,932 --> 00:51:51,108
Are you done?

936
00:51:52,196 --> 00:51:53,675
Uh, hon?

937
00:52:02,336 --> 00:52:03,294
Girls!

938
00:52:05,513 --> 00:52:07,254
[both] God, I hate them.

939
00:52:13,260 --> 00:52:15,523
[dog barking in distance]

940
00:52:18,961 --> 00:52:20,833
Oh, shit. Hell no.

941
00:52:21,007 --> 00:52:22,922
[yelping]

942
00:52:25,403 --> 00:52:26,882
Oh, shit!

943
00:52:34,499 --> 00:52:35,761
[both] Hello.

944
00:52:39,286 --> 00:52:40,679
Are you okay?

945
00:52:44,813 --> 00:52:46,293
Can we help you?

946
00:52:48,774 --> 00:52:50,384
Where are you going?

947
00:52:54,606 --> 00:52:56,085
What's up, dog?

948
00:52:57,261 --> 00:52:58,740
[whimpering]

949
00:53:00,438 --> 00:53:02,266
How's it going, Dom?

950
00:53:06,226 --> 00:53:08,794
This is your last chance, Ray.

951
00:53:08,968 --> 00:53:13,190
You need to go in there and talk
some sense into that wife of yours.

952
00:53:14,452 --> 00:53:16,280
Think she's gonna listen to me?

953
00:53:17,498 --> 00:53:19,196
You better pray that she does.

954
00:53:21,067 --> 00:53:22,373
[sighs]

955
00:53:36,865 --> 00:53:37,910
[sighs]

956
00:53:39,041 --> 00:53:40,652
[door opens]

957
00:53:49,400 --> 00:53:50,401
[door closes]

958
00:53:53,882 --> 00:53:56,624
Not exactly the warm and
fuzzy greeting I was hoping for.

959
00:53:57,451 --> 00:53:58,757
I could have shot you.

960
00:53:59,671 --> 00:54:01,194
What do you want, Ray?

961
00:54:02,282 --> 00:54:03,370
Dom sent me.

962
00:54:05,894 --> 00:54:07,983
Maybe I should have shot you.

963
00:54:11,509 --> 00:54:13,250
He wants me to get you
out of here.

964
00:54:14,425 --> 00:54:15,904
Yeah, I'm sure he does.

965
00:54:17,428 --> 00:54:18,820
What do you want?

966
00:54:21,127 --> 00:54:24,261
Oh, now you wanna know?

967
00:54:25,305 --> 00:54:26,611
We can take them.

968
00:54:28,003 --> 00:54:30,615
We? [chuckles]We.

969
00:54:32,051 --> 00:54:34,836
You just tell me what you
want me to do, and I'll do it.

970
00:54:35,010 --> 00:54:36,098
Fine.

971
00:54:38,362 --> 00:54:39,928
Get out of here.

972
00:54:41,582 --> 00:54:43,018
Ah...

973
00:54:43,192 --> 00:54:44,542
I'm not leaving.

974
00:54:45,978 --> 00:54:48,676
Ray, please go.

975
00:54:53,028 --> 00:54:56,075
Sixty-five percent. What?

976
00:54:56,249 --> 00:55:00,035
Sixty-five percent of restaurant
staff quit during their shift.

977
00:55:03,648 --> 00:55:05,606
I'm not gonna be one of 'em.

978
00:55:14,398 --> 00:55:17,009
[sighs]

979
00:55:18,315 --> 00:55:20,491
Did they hurt you out there?

980
00:55:23,755 --> 00:55:26,323
Nothing a stiff drink won't fix.

981
00:55:29,151 --> 00:55:30,675
How about you?

982
00:55:31,893 --> 00:55:34,722
Well, you should see
the other guys.

983
00:55:36,724 --> 00:55:38,247
KGB, huh?

984
00:55:39,379 --> 00:55:40,337
Ex-KGB.

985
00:55:40,511 --> 00:55:42,077
What the fuck?

986
00:55:42,991 --> 00:55:45,167
How the fuck
did we even get here?

987
00:55:45,342 --> 00:55:47,039
A Russki cooking French food.

988
00:55:47,213 --> 00:55:49,346
It's crazy.
Doesn't make any sense.

989
00:55:49,520 --> 00:55:52,305
I told you. After I left
Russia, I went to France.

990
00:55:52,479 --> 00:55:53,785
That part is true.

991
00:55:54,742 --> 00:55:56,222
What part isn't?

992
00:55:58,746 --> 00:55:59,965
The rest of it.

993
00:56:02,663 --> 00:56:04,839
I'm still the same person.

994
00:56:07,146 --> 00:56:10,541
I had no idea they were
gonna try and torch this place

995
00:56:10,715 --> 00:56:12,369
with you in it.

996
00:56:12,543 --> 00:56:14,022
Doesn't matter now.

997
00:56:15,241 --> 00:56:16,895
It matters to me.

998
00:56:21,856 --> 00:56:23,423
So what's the plan, baby?

999
00:56:23,597 --> 00:56:24,816
Well...

1000
00:56:26,818 --> 00:56:29,081
I've got a couple of ideas.

1001
00:56:29,255 --> 00:56:30,865
[chuckles]

1002
00:56:31,039 --> 00:56:32,476
I bet you do.

1003
00:56:34,086 --> 00:56:36,915
[Gary screaming]
No! Okay, just wait! Please!

1004
00:56:37,089 --> 00:56:38,569
Okay. Okay, look.

1005
00:56:38,743 --> 00:56:39,831
I asked God this morning,

1006
00:56:40,005 --> 00:56:41,615
I said,
"Send me two strong women."

1007
00:56:41,789 --> 00:56:43,487
I don't give a fuck what
you asked God about, Gary.

1008
00:56:43,661 --> 00:56:46,968
How did she seem, Gary? I don't know!
I don't know!

1009
00:56:47,142 --> 00:56:48,579
I think you do know, Gary.Okay.

1010
00:56:48,753 --> 00:56:51,625
Okay, she seemed sad.
I don't know. Sad.

1011
00:56:51,799 --> 00:56:53,366
[laughing]Honestly, sad.

1012
00:56:53,540 --> 00:56:56,717
Sad Anya. Wonderful.
And was she alone?

1013
00:56:56,891 --> 00:56:58,676
Well, sh... Yeah, she was alone.

1014
00:56:58,850 --> 00:57:01,505
She whupped all them
grown men ass by herself.

1015
00:57:01,679 --> 00:57:03,463
It was embarrassing. Oh,
so she's still sharp?

1016
00:57:03,637 --> 00:57:05,204
She's sharper
than a crackhead's toenail.

1017
00:57:05,378 --> 00:57:07,032
Honey, cut the guy some slack.

1018
00:57:07,206 --> 00:57:08,903
I wouldn't exactly be a
torturer if I cut him slack.

1019
00:57:09,077 --> 00:57:10,514
Listen to him.

1020
00:57:10,688 --> 00:57:11,776
You pussy.

1021
00:57:11,950 --> 00:57:14,126
Mimi really needs to get laid.

1022
00:57:14,300 --> 00:57:15,475
[Gary] Okay, okay!

1023
00:57:15,649 --> 00:57:17,521
How do you get in? The back door.

1024
00:57:17,695 --> 00:57:19,697
What other way
is there to get in? The front door.

1025
00:57:19,871 --> 00:57:21,742
Oh, wow, you must be
a fucking architect, Gary.

1026
00:57:21,916 --> 00:57:24,702
Not at all. I'm a masseuse.
I do nothing but massages.

1027
00:57:24,876 --> 00:57:26,225
You're a masseuse.
Do you fascial work?

1028
00:57:26,399 --> 00:57:28,706
Your neck is fine, Tom! Man up!

1029
00:57:28,880 --> 00:57:31,535
I got shrapnel between my C3
and C4. I'm in a lot of pain every day.

1030
00:57:31,709 --> 00:57:33,232
Why are there so many cars
parked down there?

1031
00:57:33,406 --> 00:57:35,277
I don't know!
I don't know, lady!

1032
00:57:35,452 --> 00:57:37,758
Well, tell me what you do know,
Gary! Bitch, I don't know shit!

1033
00:57:37,932 --> 00:57:40,282
Okay, I am so sorry
for calling you that.

1034
00:57:40,457 --> 00:57:43,547
I-I just don't wanna die. I don't think
he's lying.

1035
00:57:43,721 --> 00:57:46,288
[sobbing]
I'm not. I'm not at all.

1036
00:57:49,944 --> 00:57:51,250
Useless.

1037
00:57:51,990 --> 00:57:54,906
[panting, gasping]

1038
00:57:55,080 --> 00:57:57,256
You'll... She's...
Wait, useless?

1039
00:57:57,430 --> 00:57:59,998
H-Him or me? Him... Him or me?

1040
00:58:00,868 --> 00:58:03,610
White people, they so mean.

1041
00:58:04,959 --> 00:58:06,178
[whimpers]

1042
00:58:06,744 --> 00:58:08,659
[buzzing]

1043
00:58:10,182 --> 00:58:11,575
[phone beeps]

1044
00:58:11,749 --> 00:58:13,141
Yeah, Ray.

1045
00:58:13,315 --> 00:58:14,752
Time's up, Ray.

1046
00:58:16,188 --> 00:58:17,319
All right then.

1047
00:58:17,494 --> 00:58:19,234
Then come on out.

1048
00:58:19,408 --> 00:58:22,542
Mmm. That's not gonna happen.

1049
00:58:22,716 --> 00:58:24,588
Jesus Christ. [chuckles]

1050
00:58:24,762 --> 00:58:27,025
Do you got a death wish
or something?

1051
00:58:27,199 --> 00:58:29,288
Yeah, something like
that. Something like that.

1052
00:58:29,462 --> 00:58:33,814
I'm telling you right now,
this is your last chance.

1053
00:58:33,988 --> 00:58:38,384
If you come out right now,
well, you both go free.

1054
00:58:38,558 --> 00:58:43,345
But if you keep making me wait, I'm
gonna put a bullet in both your heads.

1055
00:58:43,520 --> 00:58:45,478
Fucking idiot.

1056
00:58:45,652 --> 00:58:48,525
If you kill us, you won't be able
to collect on the insurance money.

1057
00:58:50,048 --> 00:58:52,441
Be a shame if you did
all this for nothing.

1058
00:58:52,616 --> 00:58:55,140
It's not nothing, asshole.

1059
00:58:55,314 --> 00:58:56,750
Oh, it's something.

1060
00:58:56,924 --> 00:58:59,013
What the fuck's wrong with you?

1061
00:58:59,927 --> 00:59:01,929
You fucking idiot.

1062
00:59:04,453 --> 00:59:06,194
We're not coming out, Dom.

1063
00:59:07,065 --> 00:59:08,980
If we're going down,

1064
00:59:09,154 --> 00:59:11,112
we're going down swinging.

1065
00:59:15,464 --> 00:59:16,814
Then we're coming in.

1066
00:59:32,046 --> 00:59:33,961
Watch this shit.

1067
00:59:34,135 --> 00:59:36,877
They're gonna try to fuck me
without even buying me dinner first.

1068
00:59:40,228 --> 00:59:43,971
Let's move.[mercenaries chattering]

1069
00:59:44,145 --> 00:59:45,233
You Dom?

1070
00:59:46,844 --> 00:59:47,845
I am.

1071
00:59:48,019 --> 00:59:50,151
Good. We're here.

1072
00:59:50,761 --> 00:59:52,110
I can see that.

1073
00:59:52,284 --> 00:59:53,459
No shit.

1074
00:59:53,633 --> 00:59:55,069
You spoke to Terry?

1075
00:59:55,243 --> 00:59:58,595
I spoke to Terry. We spoke to Terry.

1076
00:59:58,769 --> 01:00:00,597
And he explained
the overtime rules?

1077
01:00:00,771 --> 01:00:01,685
[Dom exhales]

1078
01:00:01,859 --> 01:00:05,253
Yes. Several times. Yes.

1079
01:00:05,427 --> 01:00:07,952
My guys are coming straight
from another job.

1080
01:00:08,126 --> 01:00:09,997
And I appreciate that.

1081
01:00:10,824 --> 01:00:13,348
It means double time.

1082
01:00:15,437 --> 01:00:16,787
So I've heard.

1083
01:00:18,136 --> 01:00:21,748
And if we go over four
hours, we're gonna need lunch.

1084
01:00:21,922 --> 01:00:24,490
[sighs]

1085
01:00:27,972 --> 01:00:29,016

[laughing]

1087
01:00:34,369 --> 01:00:35,719
Yeah, you got it.

1088
01:00:35,893 --> 01:00:37,851
I want you to kill
that Russian bitch.

1089
01:00:38,025 --> 01:00:39,070

01:00:40,724 --> 01:00:43,901
Gary, Gary, Gary, Gary, Gary.

1092
01:00:44,075 --> 01:00:45,990
Gary, you're magic.
You're magic.

1093
01:00:46,164 --> 01:00:48,906
No, no, no, no, no.
You don't understand.

1094
01:00:49,950 --> 01:00:52,474
[groaning] Oh, Gary.

1095
01:00:52,649 --> 01:00:54,738
[neck cracks]Oh, Gary.

1096
01:00:54,912 --> 01:00:57,262
You're magic. Magic.

1097
01:00:57,436 --> 01:00:58,611
Magic hands.

1098
01:00:58,785 --> 01:01:01,135
Thank you, sir.
That means a lot, Tom.

1099
01:01:01,309 --> 01:01:02,310
[Tom] I needed this.

1100
01:01:03,268 --> 01:01:05,531
I needed this and I...
And I knew...

1101
01:01:05,705 --> 01:01:08,403
When I saw
those long phalanges, I knew.

1102
01:01:08,577 --> 01:01:09,753
[chuckles]I knew.

1103
01:01:09,927 --> 01:01:12,669
Well, you seem real stressed.

1104
01:01:14,192 --> 01:01:15,584
[grunts]

1105
01:01:15,759 --> 01:01:17,064
Yeah.

1106
01:01:18,587 --> 01:01:19,676
Yeah.

1107
01:01:33,428 --> 01:01:35,474
I used to be happy, Gary.

1108
01:01:41,959 --> 01:01:43,656
Me and Mimi were happy.

1109
01:01:45,571 --> 01:01:46,659
And we...

1110
01:01:50,924 --> 01:01:52,230
we had each other's backs.

1111
01:01:52,404 --> 01:01:55,450
She was like, "Thanks, hon.
I got you, babe.

1112
01:02:01,108 --> 01:02:02,327
I got you, babe."

1113
01:02:07,898 --> 01:02:09,682
And then we had kids.

1114
01:02:10,988 --> 01:02:11,989
[child] Hello?

1115
01:02:12,990 --> 01:02:14,513
We can hear you.

1116
01:02:19,126 --> 01:02:20,127
Yeah.

1117
01:02:21,389 --> 01:02:24,392
Me and my ex
had a cat named Blue.

1118
01:02:24,566 --> 01:02:26,133
[chuckles]

1119
01:02:26,307 --> 01:02:28,614
So I can relate with you.

1120
01:02:32,226 --> 01:02:34,141
I guess it doesn't help
that we work together.

1121
01:02:36,796 --> 01:02:38,711
What kind of work
do you do, Tom?

1122
01:02:40,626 --> 01:02:45,022
Well, Gary, I could tell you,
but I might have to kill you.

1123
01:02:45,196 --> 01:02:47,198
[both chuckle]

1124
01:02:47,372 --> 01:02:50,854
[both laughing]

1125
01:02:53,117 --> 01:02:54,727
I don't wanna kill you, Gary.

1126
01:02:54,901 --> 01:02:57,251
Yeah, we don't want that at all.

1127
01:03:00,254 --> 01:03:02,256
I'm not gonna kill you, Gary.

1128
01:03:11,657 --> 01:03:12,745
Thanks, Gary.

1129
01:03:14,703 --> 01:03:16,183
You're free to go.

1130
01:03:18,707 --> 01:03:19,839
You sure?

1131
01:03:21,580 --> 01:03:22,929
Don't wanna wait on Mimi?

1132
01:03:25,366 --> 01:03:26,803
No, I'm making the call.

1133
01:03:27,847 --> 01:03:29,066
Goodbye, Gary.

I love you girls.

1137
01:03:42,079 --> 01:03:43,994
Tom must be off his meds again.

1138
01:03:44,168 --> 01:03:45,691
There's only two ways in.

1139
01:03:45,865 --> 01:03:48,912
For everyone who's gone in,
no one's come out.

1140
01:03:49,086 --> 01:03:51,088
Rocco didn't technically go in.

1141
01:03:51,262 --> 01:03:54,265
Yeah, he exploded in the
parking lot. Thanks, Mick.

1142
01:03:56,702 --> 01:03:59,618
How many are there? Just one.

1143
01:03:59,792 --> 01:04:00,837
Just one?

1144
01:04:01,925 --> 01:04:04,536
One giant pain in the ass.

1145
01:04:04,710 --> 01:04:07,104
Well, we'll hit him
from both sides.

1146
01:04:07,278 --> 01:04:08,583
Her.

1147
01:04:08,757 --> 01:04:11,412
It's a her? It's a her.

1148
01:04:11,586 --> 01:04:14,241
Huh.
Well, that's gonna cost extra.

1149
01:04:16,243 --> 01:04:18,637
You're kidding, right? I'm not.

1150
01:04:18,811 --> 01:04:21,074
I mean, I thought
you women wanted equality.

1151
01:04:21,248 --> 01:04:23,990
You're telling me we all
showed up for one woman?

1152
01:04:24,164 --> 01:04:26,297
I'm telling you
I got 10,000 bucks

1153
01:04:26,471 --> 01:04:28,560
for the person who kills
that goddamn Russian.

1154
01:04:28,734 --> 01:04:29,909
We're dealing with Russians?

1155
01:04:30,083 --> 01:04:33,086
Technically, Russian.
Just the one. Ana.

1156
01:04:33,260 --> 01:04:35,045
Is that gonna cost us more?

1157
01:04:35,219 --> 01:04:37,047
Everything costs.

1158
01:04:38,396 --> 01:04:40,311
We've dealt
with Russians before,

1159
01:04:40,485 --> 01:04:42,617
and it's not gonna be pretty.

1160
01:04:42,791 --> 01:04:45,142
I don't need it to be
pretty. I need it to be done.

1161
01:04:45,316 --> 01:04:47,535
I'm gonna need
one of those walkie-talkies...

1162

It's my kid.

1167

I'll do him for free.

Ready?

1169
01:05:15,563 --> 01:05:16,738
Ready.

01:10:27,832 --> 01:10:31,270
Oh, come on, Mimi. It's
been such a long time ago. I...

1242
01:10:34,273 --> 01:10:36,014
I don't think you understand

1243
01:10:36,188 --> 01:10:40,410
quite how upset some of
our friends were when you left.

1244
01:10:43,717 --> 01:10:45,241
I'm sorry.

1245
01:10:48,853 --> 01:10:50,028
You're sorry?

1246
01:10:51,682 --> 01:10:53,074
I'm sorry.

1247
01:10:54,859 --> 01:10:57,383
Okay, well, then water
under the bridge, right?

1248
01:10:57,557 --> 01:10:59,777
Sure, I mean... [laughs] Wrong.

1249
01:11:04,564 --> 01:11:07,088
[chuckles] Mimi, come on.Anya.

1250
01:11:10,962 --> 01:11:12,355
All right.

1251
01:11:12,529 --> 01:11:15,271
Okay, so now what?

1252
01:11:18,056 --> 01:11:20,058
Well, now I kill you, sweetie.

1253
01:11:25,411 --> 01:11:27,848
[both grunting]

1254
01:11:31,417 --> 01:11:33,506
[Mimi]
They blamed me for leaving!

1255
01:11:35,639 --> 01:11:37,467
You're rusty.

1256
01:11:38,468 --> 01:11:39,686
[grunting]

1257
01:11:41,601 --> 01:11:43,995
You think I didn't think
about leaving, huh?

1258
01:11:44,169 --> 01:11:46,345
You could have told me!

1259
01:11:48,304 --> 01:11:50,480
Mimi, I tried to protect you.

1260
01:11:54,135 --> 01:11:55,746
[breathing heavily]

1261
01:11:57,356 --> 01:11:59,315
But I never would've left
without you.

1262
01:11:59,489 --> 01:12:01,578
[both grunting]

1263
01:12:04,058 --> 01:12:06,409
Oh, I've waited years for this.

1264
01:12:15,766 --> 01:12:18,334
I made a mistake, Mimi.
I'm sorry.

1265
01:12:18,508 --> 01:12:21,075
Aw. Not sorry enough, baby.

1266
01:12:24,035 --> 01:12:25,993
[grunting continues]

1267
01:12:32,217 --> 01:12:34,175
I never meant to hurt you.

1268
01:12:44,316 --> 01:12:45,361
[gasps]

1269
01:12:51,410 --> 01:12:54,108

[breathing heavily]

1271
01:13:12,779 --> 01:13:14,999
You left me
without cover in Paris.

1272
01:13:15,173 --> 01:13:16,435
You had Tom.

1273
01:13:16,609 --> 01:13:18,132
Tom's a moron!

1274
01:13:38,892 --> 01:13:41,242
At least your husband didn't
gamble away your dreams.

1275
01:13:41,417 --> 01:13:43,157
What are you talking about?

1276
01:13:44,332 --> 01:13:46,683
Husbands are more trouble
than they're worth.

1277
01:13:46,857 --> 01:13:48,815
Yeah, tell me about it.

1278
01:13:48,989 --> 01:13:51,122
[both panting]

1279
01:13:52,384 --> 01:13:55,213
I made a mistake, Mimi.

1280
01:13:55,953 --> 01:13:58,695
Yeah, you really did.

1281
01:14:01,262 --> 01:14:03,395
You were my family.

1282
01:14:10,663 --> 01:14:13,057
And you're still
my fucking family.

1283
01:14:13,231 --> 01:14:14,537

1285
01:14:21,544 --> 01:14:24,024
I don't believe we've been
properly introduced.

1286
01:14:30,683 --> 01:14:34,252
Oh, he's tougher than he looks.

1287
01:14:35,514 --> 01:14:36,733
Thanks, hon.

1288
01:14:37,995 --> 01:14:41,172
Well, he looks geriatric.
I hope so. [chuckles]

1289
01:14:41,346 --> 01:14:43,087
Yeah, I'm an old man...

1290

with a double-barrel shotgun
aimed at your head.

1291
01:14:48,527 --> 01:14:49,615
I'm Mimi.

1292
01:14:51,095 --> 01:14:52,705
An old friend of Ana's.

1293
01:14:54,620 --> 01:14:56,840
How about you put
that gun down, friendo?

1294
01:14:58,494 --> 01:14:59,886
Maybe he's not all bad.

1295
01:15:00,800 --> 01:15:02,628
He's got his moments.

1296
01:15:08,895 --> 01:15:10,462
I really miss you, Anya.

1297
01:15:12,029 --> 01:15:13,900
I miss you too, Mimi.

1299
01:15:25,042 --> 01:15:28,088
Well, that was fun.

[both chuckle]

1301
01:15:29,612 --> 01:15:31,222
We should go to dinner sometime.

1302
01:15:31,396 --> 01:15:33,833
Do a proper catch-up,
leave the boys at home.

1303
01:15:34,660 --> 01:15:35,618
[Ana] Sure thing.

1304
01:15:37,533 --> 01:15:39,273
Call me, okay?

1305
01:15:39,447 --> 01:15:41,537
Don't be such a stranger.

1306
01:15:43,843 --> 01:15:45,541
Thanks for the help.

Did you... Did you...

1311
01:16:22,403 --> 01:16:23,927
No. [sighs]

I'm getting soft.

1313
01:16:34,024 --> 01:16:35,634
Where's the hostage?

1314
01:16:37,288 --> 01:16:39,595
I let him go. You what?

1315
01:16:43,294 --> 01:16:44,425
I made the call.

1316
01:16:50,214 --> 01:16:51,781
You made the call.

1317
01:16:51,955 --> 01:16:53,609
Wow.

1318
01:16:53,783 --> 01:16:56,524
I'm gonna be making the call
a lot more often.

Not in front of the girls.

1320
