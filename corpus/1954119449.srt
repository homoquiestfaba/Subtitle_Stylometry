1
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:34,070
Reports of
a biological threat just heard...

2
00:00:38,569 --> 00:00:40,480
The epidemic intelligence group...

3
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:43,050
Unknown biological...

4
00:00:49,748 --> 00:00:51,791
No official
word for this time on ...

5
00:00:51,790 --> 00:00:53,960
An effort undertaken by members...

6
00:00:56,450 --> 00:00:58,299
Unexplained
underground explosion...

7
00:00:58,340 --> 00:01:00,280
As rescue crews insisted...

8
00:01:08,730 --> 00:01:12,312
... witnesses claimed
was insect-like non nature...

9
00:01:15,732 --> 00:01:17,902
The MTA officials
continue to deny...

10
00:01:17,943 --> 00:01:19,738
the existence of a mutant...

11
00:01:19,779 --> 00:01:21,404
... to deny
the existence...

12
00:01:21,446 --> 00:01:23,324
of a mutant strain
of cockroach...

13
00:01:23,325 --> 00:01:25,130
engineered by scientists...

14
00:02:50,618 --> 00:02:51,600
Taxi!

15
00:04:38,061 --> 00:04:41,280
Hey, Klaski, nice of you
to join us all on your day off.

16
00:04:41,564 --> 00:04:42,570
All right, you punk !

17
00:04:42,857 --> 00:04:43,780
Why am I here, Cleeland ?

18
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:45,350
You'll see.

19
00:04:50,364 --> 00:04:53,370
Over here we have
our taxi driver, Mr. Colm...

20
00:04:53,661 --> 00:04:56,371
who plowed into
a Mr. Trahn over there...

21
00:04:56,413 --> 00:04:57,706
who was carrying a suitcase...

22
00:04:57,747 --> 00:05:00,010
filled with about
75 pounds of dirt.

23
00:05:00,650 --> 00:05:01,300
Dirt?

24
00:05:01,710 --> 00:05:02,960
Wait, it gets better.

25
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,670
His body was totally evacuated.

26
00:05:04,713 --> 00:05:06,110
- Cleeland...
- Huh?

27
00:05:06,757 --> 00:05:08,390
- Eviscerated.
- Whatever.

28
00:05:11,790 --> 00:05:12,720
Yeah,
I've seen this before.

29
00:05:12,761 --> 00:05:14,639
It happens with
this kind of impact.

30
00:05:14,679 --> 00:05:16,960
Yeah ?
You ever seen this before ?

31
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:18,020
Flip.

32
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:49,010
Every insect lives
for just one purpose...

33
00:05:49,410 --> 00:05:50,890
survival of its own kind.

34
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:52,940
Take our ants here for example.

35
00:05:53,345 --> 00:05:55,389
They spend their whole lives...

36
00:05:55,429 --> 00:05:57,540
building this wonderful colony
for their queen...

37
00:05:58,182 --> 00:05:59,230
but she never comes.

38
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:00,820
Why not ?

39
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:04,371
Well, it's against the law
to have a fertile queen...

40
00:06:04,415 --> 00:06:06,332
because we'd
be overrun with babies.

41
00:06:07,210 --> 00:06:09,840
So instead,
they just die off...

42
00:06:10,850 --> 00:06:12,940
burying each other
in these mounds...

43
00:06:13,824 --> 00:06:16,270
until there's
only one left standing...

44
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:20,203
and that last soldier
goes on alone...

45
00:06:20,246 --> 00:06:23,541
with nothing left
to live for... or fight for.

46
00:06:23,584 --> 00:06:26,542
No one left to even bury him
when he dies.

47
00:06:28,254 --> 00:06:30,547
Since we spent
the last three weeks...

48
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:33,634
learning about various types
of insects and their habitats...

49
00:06:33,677 --> 00:06:37,054
I want each of you to choose
an insect and write a report...

50
00:06:37,098 --> 00:06:39,724
describing what your life
would be like as that insect.

51
00:06:41,777 --> 00:06:42,550
And I want it tomorrow!

52
00:06:42,580 --> 00:06:43,862
Aw ! Oh!

53
00:07:05,543 --> 00:07:08,002
Out, out, out!
Out, out, out!

54
00:07:08,003 --> 00:07:11,110
No ! No, I mean it.
Stop jumping in the puddle.

55
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:11,620
No.

56
00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:13,250
Fight, fight, fight!

57
00:07:13,301 --> 00:07:16,512
No fight. Nobody has to fight.

58
00:07:19,890 --> 00:07:20,800
Leon!

59
00:07:21,666 --> 00:07:22,580
Whoo!

60
00:07:31,902 --> 00:07:33,500
Diego, what's the matter?

61
00:07:34,029 --> 00:07:37,020
Are you good?
Come on.

62
00:08:54,819 --> 00:08:57,780
I live in the ground.
My family's all dead.

63
00:08:57,988 --> 00:09:00,840
Sometimes it makes me
feel sad and lonely.

64
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,550
Sometimes
it makes me feel angry.

65
00:09:04,310 --> 00:09:09,390
I think about the other insects.
Do they have families, too ?

66
00:09:10,876 --> 00:09:12,180
I want to know
if they're happy...

67
00:09:13,671 --> 00:09:17,200
'cause if they are happy,
I want to hurt them.

68
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:19,690
Is that all, Sal?

69
00:09:21,780 --> 00:09:23,220
That's all, Miss Panos.

70
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:35,450
Ugh. One more year.

71
00:09:36,090 --> 00:09:37,445
Hell, I'll be glad
to see it go.

72
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:39,300
This building's dying
one room at a time.

73
00:09:39,945 --> 00:09:41,322
Don't you think
after 20 years...

74
00:09:41,323 --> 00:09:42,710
you're going to miss it
just a bit?

75
00:09:42,992 --> 00:09:43,993
Are you kiddin?

76
00:09:43,994 --> 00:09:46,500
I am goin' to ride
the wreckin' ball.

77
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:47,846
Whoa! Whoa! Oh!

78
00:09:48,110 --> 00:09:50,333
Just kiddin.
Ha ha ha ha!

79
00:09:50,373 --> 00:09:52,251
No, no, no. The only
thing I'm gonna miss...

80
00:09:52,291 --> 00:09:54,080
around this place is you.

81
00:09:59,790 --> 00:10:00,549
Yo, Remi.

82
00:10:01,030 --> 00:10:02,630
Still Miss Panos to you, Nicky.

83
00:10:02,719 --> 00:10:04,190
Yeah, yeah, Miss Panos.

84
00:10:04,472 --> 00:10:05,512
What's with the shiner?

85
00:10:05,790 --> 00:10:06,690
Forgot to duck.

86
00:10:07,210 --> 00:10:08,230
Your old man again?

87
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:11,421
Yeah. So, listen.
I was wonderin', uh...

88
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:14,022
you want to go out
sometime or somethin?

89
00:10:15,020 --> 00:10:15,441
No.

90
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:16,980
Why not ? I ain 't
your student no more...

91
00:10:17,026 --> 00:10:17,830
so what's the problem ?

92
00:10:19,430 --> 00:10:21,195
The problem.
Well, it starts with jail time.

93
00:10:21,230 --> 00:10:23,070
It goes rapidly
downhill from there.

94
00:10:23,710 --> 00:10:25,140
Be our secret.

95
00:10:25,911 --> 00:10:28,871
Here's another secret...
I already have a boyfriend.

96
00:10:29,870 --> 00:10:30,960
Giet out of here. You?

97
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:33,930
What? Is that
so hard to imagine?

98
00:10:34,334 --> 00:10:35,690
No, I mean, who is he?

99
00:10:36,210 --> 00:10:41,260
His name ? His name is Noyb.

100
00:10:41,550 --> 00:10:43,886
Noyb ? What kind
of name is that ?

101
00:10:43,926 --> 00:10:46,640
None of your business.
Pheromones.

102
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:50,030
Oh-ho. None of your...
I got it. Noyb.

103
00:11:15,959 --> 00:11:18,379
This is Remi.
I can't take your call...

104
00:11:18,421 --> 00:11:21,964
but if you leave a message,
I'll get back to you...

105
00:11:22,007 --> 00:11:23,927
unless you're Jason,
in which case...

106
00:11:23,968 --> 00:11:26,290
please don't make me get
an unlisted phone number.

107
00:11:45,698 --> 00:11:47,281
I thought I heard my name.

108
00:11:47,326 --> 00:11:50,450
You did, Jason, but you
wouldn't appreciate the context.

109
00:11:51,810 --> 00:11:52,640
Can I come in?

110
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:54,790
I'm actually goin' out.

111
00:11:54,829 --> 00:11:55,720
I just want to talk.

112
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:57,459
About what?

113
00:11:58,820 --> 00:11:59,796
Us.

114
00:11:59,834 --> 00:12:01,360
We've been on one date, Jason.

115
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:04,230
You can't have an us
after one date.

116
00:12:04,757 --> 00:12:06,636
You can only have
a stalker situation.

117
00:12:07,030 --> 00:12:07,860
Am I clear on that?

118
00:12:10,305 --> 00:12:11,387
That hurts me.

119
00:12:11,430 --> 00:12:13,330
Subtle doesn't seem
to cut it with you, Jason.

120
00:12:13,610 --> 00:12:17,210
You know, I'm not one of
your goddamn insects, Remi.

121
00:12:17,853 --> 00:12:18,940
You know what I'm saying?

122
00:12:18,978 --> 00:12:19,880
Bye.

123
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:31,260
You'ire right about one thing.
Subtle doesn't cut it with me.

124
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:48,440
Oh, God. I'm a wacko magnet.

125
00:13:31,762 --> 00:13:34,210
Sorry. Excuse me.

126
00:13:46,358 --> 00:13:49,739
Mmm. Now, your
common household cockroach...

127
00:13:50,020 --> 00:13:51,180
takes it a step further.

128
00:13:51,781 --> 00:13:54,370
Not only does he use food
to attract a female...

129
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:57,300
but he mounts her as soon
as she dips down to eat it.

130
00:13:57,705 --> 00:13:59,999
Mmm. Of course,
more often than not...

131
00:14:00,042 --> 00:14:02,002
he can't find her
external genitalia...

132
00:14:02,042 --> 00:14:03,142
through all that body armor...

133
00:14:03,169 --> 00:14:05,628
.so dinner ends up
being kind of a bust...

134
00:14:05,672 --> 00:14:07,883
from a biological perspective.

135
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:11,219
Now, your common
female bed bug...

136
00:14:11,258 --> 00:14:13,700
needs no external
genitalia whatsoever.

137
00:14:14,348 --> 00:14:17,800
The male simply impales
her wherever he wants...

138
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:20,354
and if she's lucky enough
to survive the experience...

139
00:14:20,392 --> 00:14:22,290
she may actually reproduce.

140
00:14:22,690 --> 00:14:24,390
You can always tell the number
of times she's mated...

141
00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:26,010
by counting the scars.

142
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:30,370
Some more wine?

143
00:14:30,656 --> 00:14:31,370
Hmm.

144
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:55,388
Well, sorry for goin' off
at the mouth like that.

145
00:14:55,430 --> 00:14:59,056
It's... that was getting
a little bit schized.

146
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:02,396
Hey, schized works for me.

147
00:15:02,435 --> 00:15:03,521
Mm mm

148
00:15:03,561 --> 00:15:08,402
Well, anyway, thanks
for a really nice evening.

149
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:11,050
Are you sure you don't
want to grab a night cap?

150
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:14,281
Uh, it's a school night.

151
00:15:14,324 --> 00:15:17,825
So ? Whatever happened
to a little extra credit?

152
00:15:17,869 --> 00:15:19,130
Ha ha ha ha.

153
00:15:19,537 --> 00:15:20,670
Um...

154
00:15:22,037 --> 00:15:23,180
Let go, Phillip.

155
00:15:26,003 --> 00:15:27,585
Remi...

156
00:15:27,980 --> 00:15:29,140
uh...

157
00:15:50,470 --> 00:15:51,900
What the hell?

158
00:15:55,010 --> 00:15:55,800
Hey!

159
00:15:57,610 --> 00:15:58,390
Unh!

160
00:15:59,161 --> 00:16:00,960
Uhh! Uhh.

161
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:31,330
Uhh. I don't feel so good.

162
00:16:34,988 --> 00:16:37,239
Fluffy !
What are you barking at?

163
00:16:37,282 --> 00:16:38,493
Come here!

164
00:16:47,874 --> 00:16:48,830
Uhh.

165
00:17:00,763 --> 00:17:01,650
Unh!

166
00:17:03,975 --> 00:17:05,269
Unh! Uhh.

167
00:17:05,790 --> 00:17:07,240
Aah!

168
00:17:24,413 --> 00:17:25,410
What do you want?

169
00:17:32,710 --> 00:17:35,590
Just a moment of your time..
please.

170
00:17:39,470 --> 00:17:39,960
Whoa.

171
00:17:40,327 --> 00:17:42,572
Yeah, I keep meaning to talk
to the landlord about this.

172
00:17:42,614 --> 00:17:43,763
Well okee, let me take a look.

173
00:17:43,807 --> 00:17:46,780
Let me do that.
I got it. OK.

174
00:17:47,350 --> 00:17:50,250
Heh heh heh. All right.

175
00:17:52,188 --> 00:17:54,898
Wow
You're an etymologist, right?

176
00:17:54,943 --> 00:17:56,651
That means you're into bugs.

177
00:17:57,696 --> 00:18:00,200
I'll... Get that.

178
00:18:17,674 --> 00:18:23,303
Huh. You really like these
crusty little bastards, huh?

179
00:18:23,347 --> 00:18:25,139
I admire their simplicity.

180
00:18:25,183 --> 00:18:27,040
They are what they are
no matter how you dress 'em up.

181
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:29,450
Huh. Not like people, you mean.

182
00:18:29,975 --> 00:18:31,840
Yeah. Not like people.

183
00:18:32,937 --> 00:18:34,940
Uh-huh. Well, you know,
I should probably...

184
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:36,734
pay a little more attention
to our insect friends...

185
00:18:36,734 --> 00:18:39,030
instead of whacking 'em
with my shoe.

186
00:18:39,322 --> 00:18:42,657
If you're serious
and not just patronizing me...

187
00:18:42,697 --> 00:18:46,370
there's a book called
"The Secret Life of Bugs"...

188
00:18:46,408 --> 00:18:48,240
that you might
find interesting.

189
00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:54,837
Really ? Oh, yeah ?
That's a real page-turner, huh?

190
00:18:55,230 --> 00:18:56,540
It better be. I wrote it.

191
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:15,750
So, what exactly are you
searching for, Detective?

192
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:18,770
About right now I'm searching
for some information...

193
00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:20,830
on a guy named Lincoln Trahn.

194
00:19:21,830 --> 00:19:23,000
I heard what happened.

195
00:19:23,282 --> 00:19:25,242
He was, he was a colleague
of yours, right?

196
00:19:25,282 --> 00:19:29,670
Colleague? Lincoln Trahn
sold endangered species...

197
00:19:29,670 --> 00:19:31,010
on the black market.

198
00:19:31,540 --> 00:19:34,170
At least 200 species
of arthropod...

199
00:19:34,290 --> 00:19:36,837
are now extinct
thanks to Lincoln Trahn.

200
00:19:36,879 --> 00:19:41,050
So he was an enemy,
I mean on a professional level.

201
00:19:41,090 --> 00:19:42,410
I can't say I miss him.

202
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:50,670
What are you writing?

203
00:19:52,726 --> 00:19:55,590
It's a... grocery list.

204
00:19:57,320 --> 00:19:59,530
No. No, wait a minute.

205
00:19:59,890 --> 00:20:01,400
I didn't hate him like that.

206
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:02,280
Like what?

207
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:06,120
You guys work on a quota system?

208
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:08,290
Ten bucks a suspect,
something like that?

209
00:20:10,829 --> 00:20:13,081
I'm real terribly sorry...

210
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:14,600
to have troubled you,
Miss Panos.

211
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:16,200
Thank you.

212
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:22,510
You're wagging.
your antenna...

213
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:23,510
in the wrong direction,
Detective.

214
00:20:25,830 --> 00:20:27,730
Thank you very much
for your hospitality.

215
00:20:28,370 --> 00:20:29,820
Good night.

216
00:21:02,420 --> 00:21:03,320
Aah!

217
00:21:12,139 --> 00:21:14,811
Yeah, I had a problem
with Jason Mundy.

218
00:21:14,850 --> 00:21:18,312
He was a creep.
Just ask my front door.

219
00:21:18,950 --> 00:21:21,700
You know, besides rating low
on your likability list...

220
00:21:21,860 --> 00:21:23,570
Jason Mundy
and Lincoln Trahn....

221
00:21:23,570 --> 00:21:24,680
they had something else
in common.

222
00:21:24,806 --> 00:21:25,809
You want to guess what that is?

223
00:21:26,590 --> 00:21:27,040
No.

224
00:21:27,321 --> 00:21:30,380
They were both
missing their faces.

225
00:21:34,650 --> 00:21:36,206
You know,
I'm not really a shrink...

226
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:39,180
but I'd have to say that...

227
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:41,668
you really have to
hate looking at someone...

228
00:21:41,713 --> 00:21:44,400
to want to rip his face
clean off.

229
00:21:45,130 --> 00:21:48,011
This... this is crazy.

230
00:21:48,052 --> 00:21:48,940
Uh-huh.

231
00:21:49,466 --> 00:21:50,920
You know, one of your...

232
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:54,970
one of your close friends
describes you here as...

233
00:21:56,891 --> 00:22:01,149
"Pathologically
unable to sustain...

234
00:22:01,187 --> 00:22:05,525
"a proximate intrapersonal
relationship...

235
00:22:05,570 --> 00:22:07,822
"with anything
that walks on two legs."

236
00:22:07,861 --> 00:22:08,670
Huh?

237
00:22:08,710 --> 00:22:11,190
Yeah, I had to bring home
a Webster's for that one.

238
00:22:13,430 --> 00:22:14,670
Am I under arrest?

239
00:22:16,150 --> 00:22:16,740
No.

240
00:22:18,820 --> 00:22:21,280
I don't need the ten bucks
quite that bad, yet.

241
00:22:47,570 --> 00:22:50,130
So, she's your basic
predatory lesbo.

242
00:22:51,140 --> 00:22:52,180
How do you figure that?

243
00:22:53,420 --> 00:22:55,660
Well, she's a babe... A.

244
00:22:55,954 --> 00:22:57,620
B... she don't like guys.

245
00:22:57,900 --> 00:22:59,960
C... she rips
their fuckin' faces off.

246
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:01,890
Ergo lesbo.

247
00:23:02,980 --> 00:23:05,340
Hey, check this out.
Missing persons.

248
00:23:05,380 --> 00:23:06,600
Came over the wire
this morning.

249
00:23:06,964 --> 00:23:08,966
Poor schnook was last seen
with your bug lady...

250
00:23:09,005 --> 00:23:10,500
down at Remington's on 88.

251
00:23:12,342 --> 00:23:14,200
Ask me, we got ourselves a perp.

252
00:23:15,810 --> 00:23:20,602
Yeah. Hey  uh, Cleeland,
do me a favor, will you?

253
00:23:20,645 --> 00:23:23,481
Hand me that desk over there
while you're up, OK?

254
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:28,340
You're a real wacko,
you know that, Klaski?

255
00:23:28,985 --> 00:23:30,910
Yeah. No, really.
Hand that over.

256
00:23:30,950 --> 00:23:32,407
- Fuck off.
- Hey.

257
00:23:32,447 --> 00:23:33,700
Give me the goddamn desk.

258
00:23:33,740 --> 00:23:36,380
That desk weighs over
200 pounds, asshole.

259
00:23:36,530 --> 00:23:37,570
So did Jason Mundy.

260
00:23:38,454 --> 00:23:41,420
Now, if you can tell me
how a 112-pound woman...

261
00:23:41,460 --> 00:23:44,050
picked him up and chucked him
over a fuckin' lamppost...

262
00:23:44,332 --> 00:23:47,130
I will give you
a prime suspect.

263
00:23:57,014 --> 00:23:59,264
Listen, Remi,
I know this is probably...

264
00:23:59,309 --> 00:24:01,141
all a big misunderstanding...

265
00:24:01,185 --> 00:24:03,930
but you can't blame some of
the parents for over reacting.

266
00:24:03,977 --> 00:24:05,400
- You told them ?
- I...

267
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:06,780
Jesus, Morrie,
you told them.

268
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:08,314
You know I'm doing
everything I can...

269
00:24:08,359 --> 00:24:09,519
to set the record straight.

270
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:10,240
Of course you are...

271
00:24:10,525 --> 00:24:12,986
even though you find me
pathologically unable...

272
00:24:13,072 --> 00:24:15,410
to sustain a proximate
intrapersonal relationship...

273
00:24:15,450 --> 00:24:16,770
whatever the hell that means.

274
00:24:17,890 --> 00:24:19,454
But you think I said that?

275
00:24:19,450 --> 00:24:21,480
You're the only pompous
blow hard I know, Morrie.

276
00:24:24,372 --> 00:24:26,150
You'll have my resignation
in the morning...

277
00:24:26,250 --> 00:24:28,410
if you don't fire me first.

278
00:24:32,850 --> 00:24:33,990
Hmm.

279
00:24:46,510 --> 00:24:47,340
Hello?

280
00:24:49,565 --> 00:24:51,890
You hurt? You hungry?

281
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:22,520
Ugh! Ugh.

282
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:26,020
You want somethin' else, Lou?

283
00:25:26,063 --> 00:25:28,190
Nah. I gotta get
back to the school.

284
00:25:29,190 --> 00:25:31,750
The gum is hardening
under those chairs as we speak.

285
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:34,570
Yeah. You want a box for that?

286
00:25:34,770 --> 00:25:35,970
No, no. I got it.

287
00:25:36,090 --> 00:25:37,532
Yeah? Suit yourself.

288
00:25:37,810 --> 00:25:39,420
Well, I will see you later.

289
00:25:39,823 --> 00:25:41,940
- Good night, Lou.
- Good-bye.

290
00:26:00,110 --> 00:26:03,070
To think you could've been
building sand castles in Bali.

291
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:05,220
Sal.

292
00:26:05,980 --> 00:26:07,180
He's dead, isn't he?

293
00:26:12,690 --> 00:26:13,930
Didn't your aunt
come pick you up yet?

294
00:26:15,650 --> 00:26:16,840
Well, where have you been?

295
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:18,230
Around.

296
00:26:19,113 --> 00:26:20,340
It's after 6:00.

297
00:26:21,823 --> 00:26:23,784
Come on.
Let's go give her a call.

298
00:26:23,829 --> 00:26:24,830
She's not home yet.

299
00:26:25,830 --> 00:26:26,470
Where is she?

300
00:26:26,750 --> 00:26:29,630
She said she'd be here
around 6:30, 7:00 o'clock

301
00:26:33,310 --> 00:26:33,810
Sal.

302
00:26:33,850 --> 00:26:35,370
She works late on Thursdays

303
00:26:37,425 --> 00:26:38,967
We'll wait till 7:00...

304
00:26:39,053 --> 00:26:40,763
and then I'm
taking you home myself.

305
00:26:40,803 --> 00:26:41,980
You understand?

306
00:27:25,723 --> 00:27:27,200
Uhh.

307
00:28:02,930 --> 00:28:04,530
Uhh!

308
00:28:11,102 --> 00:28:12,400
Oh! Uhh!

309
00:28:13,602 --> 00:28:17,590
Oh! Ah. Ah. Uhh.

310
00:28:22,156 --> 00:28:23,080
Aire you hungry?

311
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:26,380
I've got some sunflower
seeds and some gum.

312
00:28:26,900 --> 00:28:28,180
You're leaving, aren't you?

313
00:28:29,060 --> 00:28:30,820
- Excuse me?
- You quitting?

314
00:28:33,430 --> 00:28:36,960
I might be... for a while.
I don't know.

315
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:39,350
There's some things
goin'on right now...

316
00:28:39,390 --> 00:28:41,425
I don't have a whole
lot of control over.

317
00:28:42,060 --> 00:28:43,020
Can I come with you?

318
00:28:44,511 --> 00:28:48,490
No, Sal, I'm sorry.
I really am.

319
00:30:01,294 --> 00:30:02,800
Oh, God.

320
00:30:29,770 --> 00:30:30,760
Well.

321
00:30:46,468 --> 00:30:47,927
Hi, fellas.
How are you doing?

322
00:30:47,967 --> 00:30:49,880
I'm gonna have to ask you
to clear the premises, sir.

323
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:51,940
Really?

324
00:30:53,265 --> 00:30:54,431
Security matter.

325
00:30:54,830 --> 00:30:57,700
Ha. Department of Defense.

326
00:30:58,102 --> 00:30:59,650
Wow. Well, I tell you what.

327
00:30:59,690 --> 00:31:01,728
Why don't we
call it career day, OK?

328
00:31:01,728 --> 00:31:03,229
You and I compare notes.
How about that?

329
00:31:03,459 --> 00:31:05,650
You're more than welcome to
continue your investigation...

330
00:31:05,650 --> 00:31:08,612
when we're done with ours,
Detective Klotski.

331
00:31:08,656 --> 00:31:10,198
Klaski,
Done with what?

332
00:31:10,237 --> 00:31:12,330
Since when are three local
homicides a military deal?

333
00:31:12,619 --> 00:31:13,630
I got something here.

334
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:15,010
Excuse me.

335
00:31:22,810 --> 00:31:25,370
What the hell?
Is that semen?

336
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:29,730
Hey. Yo, I'm talkin' here.

337
00:31:31,093 --> 00:31:33,390
All right, pal.
Just lay off, OK?

338
00:31:34,990 --> 00:31:36,640
Obviously, you know
I'm not at liberty...

339
00:31:36,690 --> 00:31:38,540
to discuss procedural
matters with you...

340
00:31:39,780 --> 00:31:42,160
biut I would like to leave you
with this one thought...

341
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:45,690
Days of cleaning up New York
with a gun and a toothpick...

342
00:31:46,820 --> 00:31:47,930
are over.

343
00:31:49,170 --> 00:31:52,040
Tihat's it. She's way overdue.

344
00:31:52,448 --> 00:31:53,140
Let's go.

345
00:32:01,747 --> 00:32:06,070
Huh ? What the... Who did this?

346
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:08,007
Was it here when you came in?

347
00:32:08,046 --> 00:32:08,690
No.

348
00:32:27,901 --> 00:32:28,490
Lou!

349
00:32:29,930 --> 00:32:30,770
Hey, Lou!

350
00:32:33,170 --> 00:32:34,380
Lou!

351
00:32:35,020 --> 00:32:36,330
Lou!

352
00:32:37,330 --> 00:32:40,580
Remi?
What... what's goin'on?

353
00:32:41,940 --> 00:32:43,490
What the hell is all this?

354
00:32:44,210 --> 00:32:47,230
What do you think, Morrie?
It's a prank. Where's Lou?

355
00:32:48,590 --> 00:32:49,950
Well, I haven't seen him.

356
00:32:51,430 --> 00:32:54,530
Uh, the uh. 
The mop closet door is open...

357
00:32:54,570 --> 00:32:56,090
so he's probably
around here somewhere.

358
00:32:56,264 --> 00:32:57,550
Well, maybe you could
get him over here?

359
00:32:59,515 --> 00:33:02,760
No, uh... I'll get you out.

360
00:33:02,812 --> 00:33:04,480
You just stand back

361
00:33:04,727 --> 00:33:06,730
Morrie, don't try
movin' that stuff by yourself.

362
00:33:06,899 --> 00:33:07,670
It's too heavy.

363
00:33:08,070 --> 00:33:09,940
Au contraire, my sweet.

364
00:33:10,430 --> 00:33:11,560
I've been working out.

365
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:14,830
Pilates.
You should try it.

366
00:33:15,350 --> 00:33:18,380
Not only am I 40% stronger...

367
00:33:22,860 --> 00:33:25,410
I'm like a spider monkey
in bed now.

368
00:33:26,419 --> 00:33:29,755
I'm sure Sal Geary here
is real impressed...

369
00:33:29,756 --> 00:33:31,020
aren't you, Sal?

370
00:33:32,380 --> 00:33:35,320
Uh... How are you, kid?

371
00:33:35,842 --> 00:33:37,180
Oh, I'm sorry about that now.

372
00:33:37,450 --> 00:33:38,470
Don't you worry
about a thing.

373
00:33:38,510 --> 00:33:40,400
We're gonna get you out
of here in two shakes.

374
00:33:41,766 --> 00:33:42,934
Aah! Aah!

375
00:33:42,935 --> 00:33:45,647
Morrie? Morrie!

376
00:33:45,688 --> 00:33:46,830
Aah!

377
00:33:49,210 --> 00:33:51,960
Remi! Remi!

378
00:33:55,112 --> 00:33:55,670
Run!

379
00:34:06,123 --> 00:34:07,550
Let's go ! Come on!

380
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:13,370
Get up. Get up.

381
00:34:20,013 --> 00:34:20,770
Go!

382
00:34:22,017 --> 00:34:23,980
It can't be.
It's just not possible

383
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:25,150
They're all dead.

384
00:34:26,680 --> 00:34:27,300
Come on.

385
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:35,200
Stay here.

386
00:34:56,635 --> 00:34:59,060
Aah! Oh, my God. Nicky!

387
00:34:59,580 --> 00:35:03,080
Remi. Oh, shit. Miss Panos.

388
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:04,360
What are you doing here?

389
00:35:04,850 --> 00:35:06,320
He hides here from his dad.

390
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:07,960
Did you see anything?

391
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:10,200
What?

392
00:35:10,563 --> 00:35:12,700
Never mind.
How'd you get in here?

393
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:14,920
You just pull that.

394
00:35:21,075 --> 00:35:22,533
Narc-ass piece of shit.

395
00:35:23,850 --> 00:35:27,624
You two, go to the door
and keep an eye on the hall.

396
00:35:28,980 --> 00:35:29,550
Why?

397
00:35:29,710 --> 00:35:31,940
'Cause I'm the fucking teacher,
and I said so!

398
00:35:42,222 --> 00:35:43,140
What are you doing?

399
00:35:44,392 --> 00:35:45,930
Seeing if it's out there.

400
00:35:47,290 --> 00:35:48,180
If what's out there?

401
00:35:55,030 --> 00:35:56,400
Aah!

402
00:35:56,568 --> 00:35:59,230
Run! Go! Get out of here!

403
00:36:00,241 --> 00:36:02,250
Uhh! Ugh.

404
00:36:10,150 --> 00:36:11,501
Ow, I'm gonna get sick.

405
00:36:11,780 --> 00:36:14,080
Save it. Come on.

406
00:36:15,296 --> 00:36:19,220
Holy... Look at this guy
over there.

407
00:36:19,383 --> 00:36:20,190
Is he still moving?

408
00:36:20,717 --> 00:36:23,310
Scan to the right.
One of his trails.

409
00:36:23,350 --> 00:36:23,920
Up that pipe.

410
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:29,020
No, that pipe.
Up like that, up now toward the window.

411
00:36:29,290 --> 00:36:30,590
Oh, Look at that.

412
00:36:32,550 --> 00:36:33,520
Oh, my God.

413
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:36,260
Oh, my god.

414
00:36:37,260 --> 00:36:40,330
That's the mother load, here boys
 that's means let go in here.

415
00:36:46,870 --> 00:36:48,162
The hell was that, Remi?

416
00:36:48,204 --> 00:36:49,410
Help me get this door!

417
00:36:54,290 --> 00:36:54,970
Ok,

418
00:36:55,810 --> 00:36:56,920
Nicky, got a light?

419
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:58,570
- What?
- A match! Something.

420
00:36:59,570 --> 00:37:01,630
Yeah. What?

421
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:04,740
What are we doin'
down here, Remi?

422
00:37:05,740 --> 00:37:09,210
Remi.
 What the hell was that?

423
00:37:09,730 --> 00:37:11,090
Are you gonna answer me, Remi?

424
00:37:11,979 --> 00:37:13,690
Do you remember
how not so long ago...

425
00:37:13,854 --> 00:37:14,690
a lot of children were sick...

426
00:37:14,740 --> 00:37:17,400
from a terrible disease
spread by cockroaches?

427
00:37:17,441 --> 00:37:18,750
Yeah, sort of.

428
00:37:19,390 --> 00:37:21,070
We created
a new breed of insect...

429
00:37:21,110 --> 00:37:22,910
we hoped would make
the roaches die out.

430
00:37:23,550 --> 00:37:24,960
Well, not all of'em died.

431
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:28,030
Some of'em kept on
mutating, changing.

432
00:37:29,997 --> 00:37:31,010
Into people?

433
00:37:31,050 --> 00:37:32,460
Not really.
You see, some insects...

434
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:34,739
overtime they evolve to look
and act like other insects.

435
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:36,961
It's a way of confusing
their natural enemies.

436
00:37:37,003 --> 00:37:37,964
We call them mimics.

437
00:37:38,046 --> 00:37:40,005
But these particular
guys didn't evolve...

438
00:37:40,048 --> 00:37:41,760
to just look like
another bug or animal.

439
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:45,490
They evolved to mimic
their only real predator... us.

440
00:37:46,054 --> 00:37:48,700
Looks kind of like Lou,
the janitor.

441
00:37:50,310 --> 00:37:52,250
No, Sal. That's not possible.

442
00:37:53,130 --> 00:37:54,900
They can't mimic
specific people.

443
00:37:55,780 --> 00:37:57,970
I don't know. You ask me,
that's Lou's face.

444
00:38:01,026 --> 00:38:03,180
No. That's not possible.

445
00:38:27,070 --> 00:38:27,670
Fuck!

446
00:38:35,550 --> 00:38:37,240
Come on. Wake up.

447
00:38:55,360 --> 00:38:56,830
We'll be OK, Sal. I promise.

448
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:00,820
Remember, it's not a monster.
It's an insect...

449
00:39:01,589 --> 00:39:04,860
and insects, they behave
in very predictable ways.

450
00:39:05,100 --> 00:39:08,000
It has no reason to hurt us.
Understand?

451
00:39:10,095 --> 00:39:12,264
I stood as close as
I'm standing to you right now...

452
00:39:12,308 --> 00:39:13,260
and it didn't hurt me.

453
00:39:14,380 --> 00:39:15,740
What about Mr. Deaver?

454
00:39:16,145 --> 00:39:19,710
Well, I think
what Mr. Deaver did...

455
00:39:21,790 --> 00:39:23,310
Have you ever poked
a bee's nest...

456
00:39:24,790 --> 00:39:26,760
and all the bees, they fly out
and try to sting you?

457
00:39:28,120 --> 00:39:29,680
It's because
you disturbed their nest.

458
00:39:30,450 --> 00:39:32,110
They're just acting
on instinct.

459
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:34,630
Are we in the nest?

460
00:39:35,037 --> 00:39:38,100
In a way.
In a way, yes, I think we are.

461
00:39:38,180 --> 00:39:43,464
Now we have to be
very careful not to disturb it.

462
00:39:52,554 --> 00:39:53,260
Ow.

463
00:40:10,491 --> 00:40:11,190
Uhh!

464
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:15,955
Do we have
to stay in here?

465
00:40:16,590 --> 00:40:18,550
No. Not long.

466
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:22,180
Just long enough to figure out
the best way to leave. Ok?

467
00:40:23,670 --> 00:40:26,820
It's OK. I'm not scared.

468
00:40:28,426 --> 00:40:30,800
Good. Then neither am I.

469
00:40:34,055 --> 00:40:34,610
Unh!

470
00:40:38,352 --> 00:40:39,080
What are you doing?

471
00:40:39,960 --> 00:40:40,490
I don't know.

472
00:40:44,970 --> 00:40:45,620
"Lincoln."

473
00:40:46,140 --> 00:40:46,620
Who?

474
00:40:48,100 --> 00:40:49,060
"Lincoln Trahn."

475
00:40:49,100 --> 00:40:50,340
Just don't ! Don't open it.

476
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:52,140
Why not?

477
00:40:52,408 --> 00:40:53,440
Just leave it alone.

478
00:40:55,340 --> 00:40:55,930
Whatever you say.

479
00:40:59,539 --> 00:41:00,730
- Nicky!
- I didn't do it!

480
00:41:02,780 --> 00:41:03,260
It's nothing.

481
00:41:05,940 --> 00:41:07,600
It's just dirt. It's nothing.

482
00:41:10,343 --> 00:41:13,140
Shit! Shit!

483
00:41:13,638 --> 00:41:14,600
Get it shut!

484
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:16,555
Nicky, get the strap!
Keep it closed!

485
00:41:17,557 --> 00:41:19,920
- Nicky!
- What is that, Remi?

486
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:20,810
Keep it shut!

487
00:41:20,810 --> 00:41:21,770
I'm trying!

488
00:41:21,830 --> 00:41:22,600
Just hold the top down!

489
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:24,440
- What are they?
- Get the latch!

490
00:41:25,107 --> 00:41:27,567
It's broke!
They're comin' out the sides!

491
00:41:27,609 --> 00:41:29,390
Unh! Shit.

492
00:41:30,446 --> 00:41:31,821
The strap's broken, Remi.

493
00:41:31,863 --> 00:41:32,790
Break off the legs!

494
00:41:33,114 --> 00:41:34,260
Pull! Snap them off!

495
00:41:37,660 --> 00:41:39,080
Sal. Sal, stay back.

496
00:41:39,120 --> 00:41:39,930
Come on, Sal.

497
00:41:39,980 --> 00:41:40,880
Hold it down!

498
00:41:42,410 --> 00:41:43,440
Keep it closed!

499
00:41:44,680 --> 00:41:45,530
Be careful!

500
00:41:46,530 --> 00:41:48,381
Aah! Remi, help!

501
00:41:48,422 --> 00:41:50,560
Get it off me! Help!

502
00:41:51,650 --> 00:41:53,430
Heads up! Remi!

503
00:41:53,710 --> 00:41:54,730
They're coming out the sides.

504
00:41:54,770 --> 00:41:57,430
They're everywhere!
Heads up!

505
00:41:57,598 --> 00:42:01,185
They're all over me!
They're biting me. Ow! Ow!

506
00:42:01,227 --> 00:42:03,360
- Get them off, Remi!
-get them off me!!

507
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:06,232
Hold still, come on

508
00:42:06,314 --> 00:42:07,565
Get it off me, Remi!
Get it off me!

509
00:42:07,607 --> 00:42:08,600
-Get away!
-get them off me

510
00:42:08,610 --> 00:42:10,840
Get it off me! Take them off!

511
00:42:11,240 --> 00:42:12,863
I'm getting them, Sal.
I'm getting them, hold still.

512
00:42:12,904 --> 00:42:14,140
Hold still.
 hold still

513
00:42:14,906 --> 00:42:15,750
Get them off!

514
00:42:18,080 --> 00:42:18,500
Help.

515
00:42:31,506 --> 00:42:33,350
OK. All right. OK, OK.

516
00:42:33,390 --> 00:42:36,386
It's OK.
It's all right.

517
00:42:36,428 --> 00:42:38,430
All right. Everything's
gonna be OK.

518
00:42:38,471 --> 00:42:41,058
OK. It's fine.

519
00:42:41,100 --> 00:42:42,010
This is the nest.

520
00:42:43,250 --> 00:42:44,680
I think we just disturbed it.

521
00:42:48,149 --> 00:42:48,710
OK.

522
00:43:26,230 --> 00:43:27,030
Oh, come on.

523
00:43:29,850 --> 00:43:30,770
It won't hurt us.

524
00:43:30,780 --> 00:43:32,985
At least not until it finds out
what went down in here.

525
00:43:33,560 --> 00:43:34,490
That should
give us enough time...

526
00:43:34,490 --> 00:43:35,620
to get back upstairs...

527
00:43:36,029 --> 00:43:37,874
slip through the gap in
the barricade, get to a phone.

528
00:43:37,870 --> 00:43:38,450
Then what?

529
00:43:39,690 --> 00:43:40,400
Then we wait.

530
00:43:41,530 --> 00:43:41,980
No way.

531
00:43:42,871 --> 00:43:44,250
Running would be a big mistake.

532
00:43:44,770 --> 00:43:46,710
Hopefully we can stall it
by closing a few doors.

533
00:43:46,990 --> 00:43:48,130
You call that a plan?

534
00:43:48,170 --> 00:43:48,900
You got a better one?

535
00:43:48,940 --> 00:43:51,040
Yeah! Yeah...

536
00:43:53,450 --> 00:43:55,720
Find a few more of these,
pound 'em into spikes...

537
00:43:55,883 --> 00:43:57,380
go out there and beng
the motherfucker...

538
00:43:57,430 --> 00:43:58,440
then we rabbit like hell!

539
00:43:58,440 --> 00:44:00,330
Number one, you'd never
puncture the cuticle.

540
00:44:00,360 --> 00:44:01,700
Number two, in all likelihood...

541
00:44:01,700 --> 00:44:03,948
we're dealing with a soldier
that kills when provoked...

542
00:44:03,990 --> 00:44:05,893
and number three,
you are so intoxicated....

543
00:44:05,894 --> 00:44:08,080
the only damage you're likely
to inflict is with your breath.

544
00:44:08,570 --> 00:44:10,080
What the hell
do you know, anyway?

545
00:44:10,490 --> 00:44:12,510
Your only chance in hell,
Nicky, is what I know.

546
00:44:15,340 --> 00:44:18,160
The genetics of this breed
may be scrambled all to hell...

547
00:44:18,440 --> 00:44:19,700
but it began as a cockroach...

548
00:44:19,750 --> 00:44:22,070
so it should still basically
behave like a cockroach.

549
00:44:23,190 --> 00:44:24,210
Like a cockroach?

550
00:44:24,610 --> 00:44:26,240
Roaches are
negatively phototactic...

551
00:44:26,280 --> 00:44:27,707
which means they run from light.

552
00:44:27,980 --> 00:44:29,050
They're
also thigmotactic...

553
00:44:29,170 --> 00:44:31,340
which means they like
tight, confined spaces...

554
00:44:31,628 --> 00:44:34,060
so keep away from walls
and large clustered objects.

555
00:44:35,180 --> 00:44:36,280
They also have sensors...

556
00:44:36,330 --> 00:44:38,510
that detect subtle variations
in air movement...

557
00:44:38,676 --> 00:44:39,970
so running will draw one out...

558
00:44:40,137 --> 00:44:41,650
a hell of a lot faster
than walking.

559
00:44:42,370 --> 00:44:44,430
They also demonstrate
a remarkable capacity...

560
00:44:44,473 --> 00:44:46,058
for insight learning.

561
00:44:46,340 --> 00:44:47,020
What's that?

562
00:44:47,500 --> 00:44:49,530
The ability to learn
from their own mistakes...

563
00:44:49,938 --> 00:44:51,400
Let's put some 
head and shoulders...

564
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:53,320
above just about anybody
I happen to know...

565
00:44:53,970 --> 00:44:54,910
including myself.

566
00:44:56,840 --> 00:44:58,480
So, am I gonna be
graded on this later?

567
00:44:59,840 --> 00:45:01,990
No. Strictly pass-fail.

568
00:45:14,700 --> 00:45:15,330
See anything?

569
00:45:16,420 --> 00:45:17,010
Me neither.

570
00:45:19,342 --> 00:45:21,301
All right, remember.

571
00:45:21,344 --> 00:45:24,410
Slow, stick to the center
of the hall...

572
00:45:25,540 --> 00:45:26,639
and stay behind me.

573
00:45:27,360 --> 00:45:28,610
Keep your breathing shallow.

574
00:45:30,185 --> 00:45:31,350
Try not to sweat.

575
00:45:31,400 --> 00:45:32,520
Sweat attracts 'em, too.

576
00:45:51,860 --> 00:45:52,960
- You through ?
- Yeah.

577
00:46:41,048 --> 00:46:41,640
Aah!

578
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:45,600
Nicky.

579
00:46:47,889 --> 00:46:48,290
Sorry.

580
00:46:51,220 --> 00:46:51,700
Sorry.

581
00:47:20,380 --> 00:47:21,050
Let's go.

582
00:47:45,140 --> 00:47:46,440
It's not recharged.

583
00:47:48,992 --> 00:47:49,730
Let's go anyway. Come on.

584
00:48:02,422 --> 00:48:03,610
I thought I closed that door.

585
00:48:05,840 --> 00:48:06,890
It's in here.

586
00:48:08,460 --> 00:48:10,060
It's going down, not up.

587
00:48:11,870 --> 00:48:13,820
- It's checking the babies.
- Run.

588
00:48:13,860 --> 00:48:15,560
- I thought you said not to run!
- Come on, Nicky!

589
00:48:24,987 --> 00:48:26,550
We gotta get
this stuff out of here.

590
00:48:29,740 --> 00:48:31,617
They're coming. Hurry, hurry.

591
00:48:31,659 --> 00:48:32,750
Just the loose ones.

592
00:48:37,331 --> 00:48:38,800
Help me get this stuff
out of here!

593
00:48:39,208 --> 00:48:39,660
Do them all..

594
00:48:40,540 --> 00:48:40,950
Come on.

595
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:43,050
Faster.

596
00:48:45,220 --> 00:48:46,020
Watch out!

597
00:48:47,260 --> 00:48:48,200
Careful! Careful!

598
00:48:49,680 --> 00:48:51,847
And get something in there.
Give me that stool.

599
00:48:52,120 --> 00:48:52,930
- Yeah.
-i Can't

600
00:48:52,970 --> 00:48:53,820
Hold it up with this.

601
00:48:54,700 --> 00:48:55,180
Hurry.

602
00:48:55,700 --> 00:48:56,370
Put it in.

603
00:49:05,800 --> 00:49:06,330
Go!

604
00:49:06,730 --> 00:49:07,695
- We first!
- No!

605
00:49:07,737 --> 00:49:09,360
Why does everything
have to be an argument?

606
00:49:09,410 --> 00:49:10,070
Go!

607
00:49:11,310 --> 00:49:11,760
Sal.

608
00:49:18,980 --> 00:49:19,710
Come on, Sal.

609
00:49:29,950 --> 00:49:31,270
Come on, come on!

610
00:49:35,389 --> 00:49:36,770
Aaah!

611
00:49:47,510 --> 00:49:49,180
Aah.

612
00:49:55,020 --> 00:49:55,840
What are you doing here?

613
00:49:56,244 --> 00:49:57,490
Get out of here!
Run!

614
00:50:14,560 --> 00:50:15,510
Aah!

615
00:50:29,278 --> 00:50:30,950
Aah!

616
00:50:54,177 --> 00:50:55,340
You just do it quick.

617
00:51:22,789 --> 00:51:23,580
Stay back.

618
00:51:30,410 --> 00:51:31,890
- What the hell is it?
- We gotta get out of here!

619
00:51:31,970 --> 00:51:33,770
What the fuck is that?
That's not a man!

620
00:51:34,175 --> 00:51:36,320
Jesus Christ, somebody tell me
what the fuck that is!

621
00:51:36,360 --> 00:51:37,520
- Move!
- Ungh!

622
00:51:44,600 --> 00:51:47,590
- In here!
- Come on!

623
00:51:51,026 --> 00:51:51,750
Aah!

624
00:51:51,880 --> 00:51:54,655
No,
You all right?

625
00:51:55,530 --> 00:51:56,130
Quick!

626
00:51:56,770 --> 00:51:58,180
Lights!
Get lights on!

627
00:51:58,670 --> 00:52:03,380
Remi? Remi. What are you do...
What is she...

628
00:52:03,420 --> 00:52:04,140
We gotta get lights on.

629
00:52:04,540 --> 00:52:06,880
Remi, what are you do...
What is she doing?

630
00:52:07,400 --> 00:52:08,710
It's negatively photostatic.

631
00:52:12,548 --> 00:52:14,370
It's what? 
Remi...

632
00:52:16,342 --> 00:52:16,710
Good enough.

633
00:52:17,470 --> 00:52:18,000
Remi...

634
00:52:18,520 --> 00:52:18,970
Remi!

635
00:52:21,139 --> 00:52:23,182
Tell me I just saw
a giant fucking cockroach.

636
00:52:23,225 --> 00:52:25,560
Basically a cockroach
with some ant and termite DNA...

637
00:52:25,600 --> 00:52:27,210
tossed in to spice up
the recipe.

638
00:52:28,780 --> 00:52:29,440
I need backup.

639
00:52:30,810 --> 00:52:32,210
Sorry, but I got
a better handle on this.

640
00:52:35,760 --> 00:52:37,780
- Operator.
- Yes, hello.

641
00:52:38,180 --> 00:52:40,290
Connect me to the Center
for Disease Control...

642
00:52:40,290 --> 00:52:42,290
Atlanta, E.I.S. Division.

643
00:52:42,453 --> 00:52:43,412
What's E.I.S?

644
00:52:43,452 --> 00:52:45,420
Epidemic Intelligence Service.

645
00:52:45,707 --> 00:52:46,970
E.I.S., may I help you?

646
00:52:47,250 --> 00:52:50,110
Yes, hello.
I need you to listen carefully.

647
00:52:50,877 --> 00:52:53,050
I have at least
one adult instar...

648
00:52:53,090 --> 00:52:55,480
of the Judas breed
at this location.

649
00:52:56,120 --> 00:52:57,310
There may be more.
I don't know.

650
00:52:57,592 --> 00:52:58,480
Judas breed, you said?

651
00:52:58,520 --> 00:53:00,150
That's right. Judas breed.

652
00:53:00,910 --> 00:53:02,380
There's a possible
satellite colony...

653
00:53:02,432 --> 00:53:03,932
being established
inside the building.

654
00:53:03,975 --> 00:53:04,930
Where are you located?

655
00:53:04,980 --> 00:53:08,853
It's a public school,
South Bronx P.S. 400.

656
00:53:08,895 --> 00:53:09,710
How many in the building?

657
00:53:09,750 --> 00:53:10,320
It's 4 of us.

658
00:53:10,770 --> 00:53:11,730
Are you armed?

659
00:53:11,899 --> 00:53:13,530
- Are we armed?
- No.

660
00:53:13,570 --> 00:53:14,630
No, we're not armed.

661
00:53:14,670 --> 00:53:16,040
All right,
keep the line open, then.

662
00:53:16,090 --> 00:53:18,760
Yes, keep an open line.
Please hurry.

663
00:53:41,570 --> 00:53:42,290
Let me see that.

664
00:53:48,977 --> 00:53:49,560
Yeah.

665
00:53:51,981 --> 00:53:52,950
What are you doing?

666
00:53:52,950 --> 00:53:55,220
I'm gonna take
its fucking head off.

667
00:53:55,510 --> 00:53:57,990
You won't even make a scratch
unless it's in molt.

668
00:53:58,030 --> 00:53:58,970
Besides,
you know what happens...

669
00:53:59,010 --> 00:54:00,250
when you take the head
off a cockroach?

670
00:54:01,730 --> 00:54:03,200
It dies?

671
00:54:03,241 --> 00:54:04,620
That's right. It dies.

672
00:54:04,790 --> 00:54:07,740
About nine days from now when
it finally starves to death.

673
00:54:13,160 --> 00:54:13,600
Fuck.

674
00:54:26,930 --> 00:54:28,220
Panos? Remi Panos?

675
00:54:28,260 --> 00:54:30,140
I don't give a red rat's ass
about Remi Panos.

676
00:54:30,190 --> 00:54:32,640
She was with you CDC morons
when you caused this disaster.

677
00:54:32,689 --> 00:54:33,982
You're such a people person.

678
00:54:34,022 --> 00:54:35,320
You don't think
this is an Army concern...

679
00:54:35,360 --> 00:54:37,066
you take it up with whatever
governing authority...

680
00:54:37,109 --> 00:54:38,530
That shake out of bed
at 3:00 in the morning.

681
00:54:41,680 --> 00:54:42,690
All right, ladies.

682
00:54:42,730 --> 00:54:45,530
We get in, we get out, before
the CDC or anybody else...

683
00:54:45,660 --> 00:54:47,420
can turn this into
another goddamn circus.

684
00:54:47,703 --> 00:54:49,480
You think it's still out there?

685
00:54:54,459 --> 00:54:55,480
I don't hear anything.

686
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:57,310
Cause it's not out there.

687
00:54:57,714 --> 00:54:58,310
What?

688
00:54:58,710 --> 00:54:59,390
It's right here.

689
00:55:01,440 --> 00:55:02,310
Right where, Remi?

690
00:55:09,182 --> 00:55:10,410
Oh, fuck.

691
00:55:13,030 --> 00:55:14,070
Where's it coming from?

692
00:55:14,110 --> 00:55:14,890
It's inside the wall.

693
00:55:15,897 --> 00:55:17,490
How the fuck
did it get in there?

694
00:55:18,250 --> 00:55:19,693
Lateral compression.

695
00:55:19,694 --> 00:55:21,696
The same way it
gets inside your stereo.

696
00:55:21,738 --> 00:55:23,080
What's it doing now?

697
00:55:23,720 --> 00:55:24,730
Tracking me.

698
00:55:25,730 --> 00:55:27,493
My pheromones, probably.

699
00:55:27,690 --> 00:55:28,500
Phero what?

700
00:55:28,540 --> 00:55:30,910
Chemical markers. Scent.

701
00:55:32,150 --> 00:55:33,310
What are we gonna do now?

702
00:55:33,350 --> 00:55:36,252
 Christ, Christ.\ It's gonna be hours
before the CDC gets here.

703
00:55:36,294 --> 00:55:38,080
Yeah, but we're not
gonna last that long.

704
00:55:38,962 --> 00:55:40,340
I'll stay. You go.

705
00:55:40,870 --> 00:55:42,591
- What?
- I'm the one it wants.

706
00:55:43,110 --> 00:55:43,680
No.

707
00:55:45,400 --> 00:55:46,600
You can't know that, Remi.

708
00:55:50,040 --> 00:55:51,230
I'd say it's
pretty damn obvious.

709
00:55:52,950 --> 00:55:53,620
You can't.

710
00:55:54,510 --> 00:55:54,980
Yeah.

711
00:55:56,460 --> 00:55:57,620
Hey, we're not leaving, Remi.

712
00:55:59,550 --> 00:56:00,820
That thing bursts
through the wall...

713
00:56:00,984 --> 00:56:01,910
you're gonna
stop it with what...

714
00:56:01,960 --> 00:56:04,000
a letter opener
and a box of thumb tacks?

715
00:56:04,200 --> 00:56:04,610
But...

716
00:56:04,650 --> 00:56:07,150
If I stay here and don't move,
I won't provoke it.

717
00:56:08,030 --> 00:56:08,960
Better off without you here.

718
00:56:11,970 --> 00:56:12,850
I'll be ok, Sal.

719
00:56:13,370 --> 00:56:14,010
I promise.

720
00:56:15,499 --> 00:56:15,990
Sal...

721
00:56:16,510 --> 00:56:19,290
Wait. You said it's following
your scent, right ?

722
00:56:22,089 --> 00:56:23,300
Can we, I don't know...

723
00:56:23,340 --> 00:56:24,600
leave your scent behind
or something?

724
00:56:25,240 --> 00:56:26,100
What do you mean?

725
00:56:26,220 --> 00:56:27,540
I  know, you know,
like a distraction...

726
00:56:27,590 --> 00:56:28,428
a decoy or something.

727
00:56:28,471 --> 00:56:29,560
Clothes, maybe.

728
00:56:29,570 --> 00:56:31,930
We'd have to leave 'em behind
in roughly the same positions, it's...

729
00:56:37,479 --> 00:56:38,650
We don't know this'll work.

730
00:56:39,774 --> 00:56:41,830
- We don't know it won't.
- That's not bad.

731
00:56:43,070 --> 00:56:43,900
All right.

732
00:56:45,028 --> 00:56:46,470
- You and Sal go.
- No.

733
00:56:46,880 --> 00:56:48,770
Sal, this is your best chance
and you're taking it.

734
00:56:48,770 --> 00:56:49,658
You understand?

735
00:56:49,890 --> 00:56:51,590
Nicky and I,
we're right behind you, ok?

736
00:56:52,710 --> 00:56:54,287
Please, get Sal out of here.

737
00:56:54,930 --> 00:56:55,660
Do whatever it takes.

738
00:56:55,790 --> 00:56:59,042
I'm coming back if you're not
out that door in 60 seconds.

739
00:56:59,320 --> 00:56:59,860
Fair enough.

740
00:57:00,860 --> 00:57:03,120
OK.......OK, come on, Sal.

741
00:57:03,120 --> 00:57:03,680
Come on, let's go.

742
00:57:03,720 --> 00:57:05,049
You heard the lady. Let's go.

743
00:57:05,810 --> 00:57:07,380
I need you
to do this, Sal, OK?

744
00:57:11,889 --> 00:57:12,970
Let's go.

745
00:57:19,148 --> 00:57:21,410
Here. I stole it.

746
00:57:23,859 --> 00:57:25,160
I'm sorry I made you cry.

747
00:57:35,740 --> 00:57:36,700
You ready to do this?

748
00:57:38,940 --> 00:57:39,999
Sure this is gonna work?

749
00:57:40,043 --> 00:57:41,880
It was your idea, remember?

750
00:57:57,478 --> 00:57:59,227
The female scent is
the strongest attractant...

751
00:57:59,271 --> 00:58:00,500
there is in the insect world.

752
00:58:01,023 --> 00:58:03,360
I've seen just one molecule
drive males into fits...

753
00:58:03,400 --> 00:58:05,830
of self-destruction,
ripping themselves apart...

754
00:58:05,860 --> 00:58:08,050
completely overriding
what limited capacity...

755
00:58:08,050 --> 00:58:10,010
for reason
they might otherwise had.

756
00:58:58,430 --> 00:59:00,410
I could die
in the next two minutes.

757
00:59:01,333 --> 00:59:02,460
Well, if you don't
move your hand...

758
00:59:02,500 --> 00:59:04,003
you're gonna die
in the next few seconds.

759
00:59:04,280 --> 00:59:04,900
Sorry.

760
01:00:15,390 --> 01:00:16,400
Don't ianswer it.

761
01:00:34,175 --> 01:00:36,550
Move, move !
Take your positions!

762
01:00:36,594 --> 01:00:38,514
- Let's go, Move, move!
- Over there!

763
01:00:47,260 --> 01:00:48,320
She didn't answer.

764
01:00:48,482 --> 01:00:50,620
You're surprised ? I'm not.

765
01:00:50,900 --> 01:00:52,660
Let's go, go, go!

766
01:00:55,864 --> 01:00:57,300
Gives me the willies.

767
01:00:58,992 --> 01:01:01,990
Move!, move! 
This way back!

768
01:01:07,150 --> 01:01:07,730
Run.

769
01:01:13,370 --> 01:01:14,400
Don't shoot! Don't shoot!

770
01:01:16,740 --> 01:01:20,420
There's two more inside!
There's two more inside!

771
01:01:20,460 --> 01:01:22,060
- Where?
- In the principal's office.

772
01:01:22,100 --> 01:01:24,518
- No, not anymore.
- What do you mean?

773
01:01:24,558 --> 01:01:25,603
No, we just rang it.

774
01:01:25,643 --> 01:01:28,980
There's nobody in there...
alive, at least.

775
01:01:29,260 --> 01:01:30,940
What are you talking about?
You can't know that!

776
01:01:30,983 --> 01:01:32,942
No, we just rang the office
and nobody picked up.

777
01:01:32,985 --> 01:01:34,850
You rang it?
I just came from there! 
 Hey that's it!

778
01:01:34,890 --> 01:01:37,600
Back off, Detective!

779
01:01:46,206 --> 01:01:47,270
What was that, Remi?

780
01:01:47,790 --> 01:01:48,980
Come on, just keep going.

781
01:02:06,080 --> 01:02:06,750
Remi?

782
01:02:07,518 --> 01:02:08,140
Detective!

783
01:02:09,510 --> 01:02:10,990
We'll take it from here, thanks.

784
01:02:11,273 --> 01:02:12,780
Sergeant, escort these two
to the holding area.

785
01:02:12,780 --> 01:02:14,040
I want this premises sealed now.

786
01:02:15,610 --> 01:02:16,420
What are you doing?

787
01:02:17,080 --> 01:02:19,070
Containment and eradication.
It's that simple.

788
01:02:19,700 --> 01:02:20,491
Give me five minutes.

789
01:02:20,532 --> 01:02:21,930
Can't do it.
Every second we delay...

790
01:02:21,930 --> 01:02:23,576
lowers our probability
of success.

791
01:02:23,662 --> 01:02:26,120
God damn it, there's
still two people in there.

792
01:02:26,121 --> 01:02:27,660
There's a hell of a lot
more hanging on this deal...

793
01:02:27,748 --> 01:02:29,430
than two people who are
probably dead already.

794
01:02:32,085 --> 01:02:32,800
Sergeant.

795
01:02:32,960 --> 01:02:33,910
Let's go.

796
01:02:35,150 --> 01:02:35,780
Hey...

797
01:02:37,710 --> 01:02:38,920
Aren't you gonna
take my gun first?

798
01:02:41,427 --> 01:02:42,100
Take his gun.

799
01:02:49,260 --> 01:02:50,110
Hey, asshole!

800
01:02:55,442 --> 01:02:56,310
Clear the stairs!

801
01:03:01,447 --> 01:03:02,600
Stay down.

802
01:03:07,161 --> 01:03:09,340
- What's it doing now, Remi?
- I don't know.

803
01:03:14,670 --> 01:03:15,850
Oh, God, your scent.

804
01:03:15,890 --> 01:03:16,970
What about my scent, Remi?

805
01:03:17,020 --> 01:03:18,090
It's all over me now.

806
01:03:19,174 --> 01:03:20,301
What does that mean?

807
01:03:20,820 --> 01:03:24,190
Deaver, Jason Mundy, Lou...

808
01:03:25,070 --> 01:03:25,500
What?

809
01:03:25,510 --> 01:03:27,280
It's eliminating
the competition.

810
01:03:30,960 --> 01:03:32,930
- About what
- You gotta get out of here,
Nicky.

811
01:03:34,982 --> 01:03:35,960
Get out of here, Nicky. Go!

812
01:03:43,010 --> 01:03:43,690
Unhh.

813
01:03:44,783 --> 01:03:45,280
Ohh.

814
01:03:51,082 --> 01:03:51,560
Unhh.

815
01:04:12,519 --> 01:04:13,938
Hey, you guys,
it's down the hall!

816
01:04:13,978 --> 01:04:14,210
Where?

817
01:04:14,260 --> 01:04:16,690
Right down the hall,
man, come on!

818
01:04:16,732 --> 01:04:18,320
Get him out of here!
Get him out of here!

819
01:04:24,114 --> 01:04:27,034
Aah!

820
01:04:40,730 --> 01:04:42,090
Let's get out of here, now!

821
01:04:42,132 --> 01:04:42,690
Unhh!

822
01:04:42,730 --> 01:04:43,750
- Come on! 
- It's not dead

823
01:04:44,803 --> 01:04:45,990
Come on,
what are you waiting for?

824
01:04:46,638 --> 01:04:47,250
Get out of here!

825
01:04:48,137 --> 01:04:50,099
Don't be stupid!
Let's go!

826
01:04:50,139 --> 01:04:51,470
Last chance!

827
01:04:56,860 --> 01:04:57,750
- Screw it Bob.

828
01:05:10,610 --> 01:05:12,160
Couldn't stop
the detective, sir.

829
01:05:12,570 --> 01:05:14,450
He took off
toi recover the woman's body.

830
01:05:16,740 --> 01:05:17,690
Get everybody back.

831
01:05:23,520 --> 01:05:26,320
- You know, i got a son about your age.
- Sorry to hear that.

832
01:05:27,440 --> 01:05:29,270
The canisters are being
put in place, sir!

833
01:05:30,960 --> 01:05:32,600
Now let's get
this puppy packing!

834
01:05:32,850 --> 01:05:33,976
- Sarge.
- Sir?

835
01:05:34,018 --> 01:05:34,830
Expedite the kids.

836
01:05:35,351 --> 01:05:36,380
Let's go, son.

837
01:05:39,857 --> 01:05:42,140
Bring them down!
let's go!!!!, 

838
01:05:42,140 --> 01:05:44,020
He's in!!!
- Cut

839
01:06:01,940 --> 01:06:02,650
Ohh.

840
01:06:03,173 --> 01:06:05,466
Unhh. Ohh.

841
01:06:05,508 --> 01:06:06,260
Aah!

842
01:06:48,600 --> 01:06:49,310
Aah.

843
01:06:55,350 --> 01:06:56,260
Remi.

844
01:07:03,400 --> 01:07:04,770
Hold out\/one thousand...

845
01:07:04,817 --> 01:07:07,110
Primaries in place!
Clear the area!

846
01:07:08,321 --> 01:07:10,280
OK, you heard him.
Let's go!

847
01:07:10,281 --> 01:07:12,158
Move it! Move it!

848
01:08:04,840 --> 01:08:05,560
Unhh.

849
01:08:24,870 --> 01:08:25,607
Easy, easy.

850
01:08:25,649 --> 01:08:27,901
Easy, easy.
You're among friends.

851
01:08:28,983 --> 01:08:30,400
I'm Dr. Shapira.

852
01:08:31,610 --> 01:08:32,610
How are you feeling?

853
01:08:36,076 --> 01:08:38,077
Still sensitive.
That.....That's good.

854
01:08:38,116 --> 01:08:39,680
A good neural response.

855
01:08:42,374 --> 01:08:44,520
You're something of
a medical marvel, you know.

856
01:08:45,041 --> 01:08:47,461
No internal bleeding.
No infection.

857
01:08:47,504 --> 01:08:48,838
I don't know whether
to write a paper...

858
01:08:48,838 --> 01:08:49,030
or take you out dancing.
I don't know whether
to write a paper...

859
01:08:49,030 --> 01:08:49,970
or take you out dancing.

860
01:08:50,010 --> 01:08:54,048
- Oh, God.
Something....... something in my...
- You made it

861
01:08:54,049 --> 01:08:55,719
There was,
but it's all gone now.

862
01:08:55,762 --> 01:08:59,057
We cleared away every last bit
of it, I assure you.

863
01:08:59,090 --> 01:09:00,310
All of it?

864
01:09:00,474 --> 01:09:02,330
Absolutely all of it.

865
01:09:03,309 --> 01:09:04,520
What was it?

866
01:09:04,521 --> 01:09:06,920
Can you tell me what it was?

867
01:09:11,930 --> 01:09:12,880
Larva.

868
01:09:14,362 --> 01:09:15,430
Insect larva.

869
01:09:16,550 --> 01:09:18,076
I don't know
exactly what variety...

870
01:09:18,076 --> 01:09:18,150
because they were
immediately confiscated...
I don't know
exactly what variety...

871
01:09:18,150 --> 01:09:20,320
because they were
immediately confiscated...

872
01:09:20,360 --> 01:09:21,911
by the Department of Defense.

873
01:09:21,956 --> 01:09:24,165
But they were, in fact largely responsible,

874
01:09:24,206 --> 01:09:26,876
for your remarkable turn around.

875
01:09:26,916 --> 01:09:27,700
How?

876
01:09:30,470 --> 01:09:31,370
They're necrophagous.

877
01:09:33,090 --> 01:09:34,930
In much the same way
ordinary maggots...

878
01:09:34,970 --> 01:09:36,720
iwere used
by medieval physicians...

879
01:09:36,759 --> 01:09:38,620
to eat away dead
and infected tissue.

880
01:09:39,264 --> 01:09:42,893
Those remarkable buggers cleaned
you up like little shopvacs...

881
01:09:42,933 --> 01:09:46,646
and their mucoid secretions
staunched your bleeding to boot.

882
01:09:46,688 --> 01:09:49,540
Miss Remi, I think you probably
owe them your life.

883
01:10:16,968 --> 01:10:18,900
Whoa, It is dead, right?

884
01:10:19,420 --> 01:10:20,780
Looks dead to me.

885
01:10:21,420 --> 01:10:24,150
Not good. This is very bad news.

886
01:10:24,790 --> 01:10:26,220
This thing's already morphed.

887
01:10:26,500 --> 01:10:27,600
It's just the outer casing.

888
01:10:27,646 --> 01:10:29,200
We gotta
find it while it's still soft.

889
01:10:29,606 --> 01:10:30,700
Oh, Jesus.

890
01:10:31,108 --> 01:10:33,858
This thing's already
metamorphed into a new instar.

891
01:10:34,620 --> 01:10:36,470
What the hell
are we looking for?

892
01:10:42,600 --> 01:10:44,670
You have a visitor.

893
01:10:45,320 --> 01:10:45,720
Who?

894
01:10:46,246 --> 01:10:47,640
Says he's family.

895
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:50,440
Does he have a name?

896
01:10:50,961 --> 01:10:52,370
Not one he's willing to share.

897
01:10:57,465 --> 01:10:58,690
Family, huh?

898
01:10:59,900 --> 01:11:02,130
Get your little
miscreant butt over here.

899
01:11:06,500 --> 01:11:08,390
It looks worse than it feels.

900
01:11:11,290 --> 01:11:12,590
How'd you get here, anyway?

901
01:11:13,590 --> 01:11:14,310
My aunt drove me.

902
01:11:15,550 --> 01:11:16,200
Yeah?

903
01:11:16,600 --> 01:11:17,110
Yeah.

904
01:11:19,532 --> 01:11:20,440
Where is she now?

905
01:11:22,991 --> 01:11:25,996
You made it up.
You don't have an aunt.

906
01:11:25,997 --> 01:11:26,480
I do.

907
01:11:28,680 --> 01:11:29,640
Lots of ants.

908
01:11:43,130 --> 01:11:45,348
Remember, Sal,
this is a foster situation.

909
01:11:45,390 --> 01:11:46,280
You clear on what that is?

910
01:11:46,684 --> 01:11:47,980
No long-term commitments.

911
01:11:48,350 --> 01:11:49,680
Just want to be clear.

912
01:11:51,021 --> 01:11:52,720
- Keep the change.
- Thanks, lady.

913
01:11:55,130 --> 01:11:55,920
What do you think?

914
01:11:56,800 --> 01:11:58,620
I kinda pictured something
a little different.

915
01:11:58,903 --> 01:12:00,830
- Yeah, like how ?
- More yellow.

916
01:12:01,110 --> 01:12:01,610
Yellow?

917
01:12:02,617 --> 01:12:04,470
Yeah, yellow...
with chocolate sprinkles.

918
01:12:06,400 --> 01:12:07,630
OK.

919
01:12:11,331 --> 01:12:12,440
Check out the new door.

920
01:12:13,209 --> 01:12:15,820
Three-inch reinforced steel.

921
01:12:19,841 --> 01:12:20,920
Stay here.

922
01:12:30,080 --> 01:12:31,540
I thought I told you
to stay in the hall.

923
01:13:16,640 --> 01:13:17,880
Sit here. Don't move.

924
01:14:03,610 --> 01:14:04,500
Thank God it's you.

925
01:14:17,460 --> 01:14:18,880
Ah, Christ. How much longer...

926
01:14:18,920 --> 01:14:20,840
we gotta pick over
this fucking place?

927
01:14:21,005 --> 01:14:22,966
What the hell do you care?
You're on an hourly.

928
01:14:23,006 --> 01:14:24,700
Yeah. Who do I see
about a raise?

929
01:14:25,341 --> 01:14:27,390
Wait a second. What's that?

930
01:14:28,845 --> 01:14:30,960
Looks like your buddy
Detective Klaski.

931
01:14:31,724 --> 01:14:34,890
Wait a second.
If that's KlaskiThen,

932
01:14:35,890 --> 01:14:37,990
who the hell carried
that girl out of here?

933
01:17:25,350 --> 01:17:26,110
Nine days?

934
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:31,010
<i>Although it's right before me</i>

935
01:17:31,010 --> 01:17:33,010
<i>There are some things
you can never see</i>

936
01:17:33,010 --> 01:17:35,010
<i>I know that you</i>

937
01:17:35,010 --> 01:17:37,010
<i>You adore me</i>

938
01:17:37,010 --> 01:17:39,010
<i>But you're killing me
so softly</i>

939
01:17:39,010 --> 01:17:41,010
<i>This brutality</i>

940
01:17:41,010 --> 01:17:43,010
<i>No wit's here</i>

941
01:17:43,010 --> 01:17:45,010
<i>Beside me</i>

942
01:17:45,010 --> 01:17:47,010
<i>There is a warmth
I'm beginning to feel</i</i>

943
01:17:47,010 --> 01:17:49,010
<i>This bright light burns</i>

944
01:17:49,010 --> 01:17:51,010
<i>And excites me</i>

945
01:17:51,010 --> 01:17:53,010
<i>I'm being burned
by the flame it yields</i>

946
01:17:53,010 --> 01:17:55,010
<i>This brutality</i>

947
01:17:55,010 --> 01:17:57,010
<i>I believe</i>

948
01:17:57,010 --> 01:17:59,010
<i>Behind me</i>

949
01:17:59,010 --> 01:18:01,010
<i>There are some wounds
that will never heal</i>

950
01:18:01,010 --> 01:18:03,010
<i>A fire basically
comes to haunt me</i>

951
01:18:03,010 --> 01:18:05,010
<i>It leaves a scar</i>

952
01:18:05,010 --> 01:18:07,010
<i>I can't conceal</i>
