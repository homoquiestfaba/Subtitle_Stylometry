1
00:00:36,501 --> 00:00:39,437
[Soft, indistinct chatter]

2
00:00:44,576 --> 00:00:45,976
- You have your key
In there, sir?

3
00:00:45,978 --> 00:00:47,678
- Yeah.

4
00:01:05,497 --> 00:01:08,432
[Scattered cheers, shouting]

5
00:01:12,504 --> 00:01:14,405
- House lights?

6
00:01:14,407 --> 00:01:16,673
Go--wally, go on house lights.

7
00:01:21,179 --> 00:01:24,114
- You ready?

8
00:01:24,116 --> 00:01:27,084
- Spotlight.
Spotlight. Spotlight.

9
00:01:27,086 --> 00:01:30,021
[Cheers and applause]

10
00:01:49,207 --> 00:01:51,141
- Thank you.

11
00:01:51,143 --> 00:01:54,811
Hi.

12
00:01:54,813 --> 00:01:56,746
Thank you very much.

13
00:01:56,748 --> 00:01:59,950
Uh, Thank you.
Hello, everybody.

14
00:01:59,952 --> 00:02:01,685
Um, Hello.

15
00:02:01,687 --> 00:02:05,322
I mean, by everybody,
I mean, uh, you guys.

16
00:02:05,324 --> 00:02:09,026
Uh, i mean
Everybody who's here.

17
00:02:09,028 --> 00:02:10,760
Really i shouldn't
Say "everybody,"

18
00:02:10,762 --> 00:02:15,032
Because most people
Are not here.

19
00:02:15,034 --> 00:02:19,503
By a pretty huge majority,

20
00:02:19,505 --> 00:02:22,373
Most people are not here.

21
00:02:22,375 --> 00:02:25,109
Most people are in China,
Actually.

22
00:02:25,111 --> 00:02:27,044
It's true.

23
00:02:27,046 --> 00:02:28,312
Actually, that's not true.

24
00:02:28,314 --> 00:02:30,847
Most people are dead.
Did you know that?

25
00:02:30,849 --> 00:02:32,616
It's true.

26
00:02:32,618 --> 00:02:34,718
Out of all the people
That ever were,

27
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:36,453
Almost all of them are dead.

28
00:02:36,455 --> 00:02:39,323
There are
Way more dead people.

29
00:02:39,325 --> 00:02:43,127
And you're all gonna die,
And...

30
00:02:43,129 --> 00:02:46,530
And then you're gonna be dead
For way longer than your life.

31
00:02:46,532 --> 00:02:51,535
Like, that's mostly
What you're ever gonna be.

32
00:02:51,537 --> 00:02:53,637
You're just dead people
That didn't die yet.

33
00:02:53,639 --> 00:02:55,606
That's...

34
00:02:58,610 --> 00:03:01,044
There are so many dead people.

35
00:03:01,046 --> 00:03:05,749
Ray Charles is dead.
Hitler.

36
00:03:05,751 --> 00:03:08,085
Bunch of other ones.

37
00:03:08,087 --> 00:03:10,488
But mostly those two guys.

38
00:03:10,490 --> 00:03:12,556
And...

39
00:03:12,558 --> 00:03:13,657
It's true.

40
00:03:13,659 --> 00:03:15,092
Ray Charles and Hitler
Are both dead.

41
00:03:15,094 --> 00:03:17,094
And really it's the only thing
They have in common,

42
00:03:17,096 --> 00:03:19,963
Because otherwise
They're very different dudes.

43
00:03:19,965 --> 00:03:23,801
Many contrasts between Hitler
And Ray Charles.

44
00:03:23,803 --> 00:03:25,069
I'm gonna tell you
A few of 'em.

45
00:03:25,071 --> 00:03:29,506
Um, Ray Charles was black.

46
00:03:29,508 --> 00:03:34,512
Hitler was not.

47
00:03:34,514 --> 00:03:38,482
Hitler killed several Jews.

48
00:03:38,484 --> 00:03:39,883
Too many.
I'll say too many.

49
00:03:39,885 --> 00:03:41,819
He killed an excessive amount
of Jews.

50
00:03:41,821 --> 00:03:44,088
He really...

51
00:03:44,090 --> 00:03:45,889
Beat that thing to the ground.

52
00:03:45,891 --> 00:03:48,626
He killed way--
He just--no moderation.

53
00:03:51,663 --> 00:03:55,032
Ray charles, meanwhile,
Hardly any Jews.

54
00:03:55,034 --> 00:03:58,635
He killed so few Jews.

55
00:04:02,941 --> 00:04:05,609
Uh...

56
00:04:05,611 --> 00:04:08,879
I don't know
How to start Shows.

57
00:04:08,881 --> 00:04:12,483
It's just a problem
That i have.

58
00:04:12,485 --> 00:04:13,717
I never...

59
00:04:13,719 --> 00:04:15,618
I never figured out how to come
Out and just start talking,

60
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:17,087
Because the first thing

61
00:04:17,089 --> 00:04:18,488
You say on stage
Always feels stupid,

62
00:04:18,490 --> 00:04:23,227
Because there's no real reason
For me to talk to you.

63
00:04:23,229 --> 00:04:24,761
It just doesn't exist.

64
00:04:24,763 --> 00:04:26,263
I don't know you.

65
00:04:26,265 --> 00:04:27,965
You don't--you're--
You don't even know each other.

66
00:04:27,967 --> 00:04:29,366
You're facing
The same direction.

67
00:04:29,368 --> 00:04:31,235
That's all
You have in common.

68
00:04:31,237 --> 00:04:33,904
So i just have to...Bleh!

69
00:04:33,906 --> 00:04:36,106
It's like talking
To a girl at a bar

70
00:04:36,108 --> 00:04:37,407
Because
You're attracted to her.

71
00:04:37,409 --> 00:04:38,809
The first thing you say

72
00:04:38,811 --> 00:04:41,945
Is just gonna be dog shit
Coming out of your mouth.

73
00:04:41,947 --> 00:04:43,347
Because you don't know her.

74
00:04:43,349 --> 00:04:45,615
The only honest thing
That you could say to her

75
00:04:45,617 --> 00:04:47,184
Is "i want
To fuck your face."

76
00:04:47,186 --> 00:04:49,152
That's the only thing
You could say

77
00:04:49,154 --> 00:04:53,056
That you could mean.

78
00:04:53,058 --> 00:04:56,327
Anything else you say
Is you trying really hard

79
00:04:56,329 --> 00:04:58,262
Not to say
"I want to fuck your face."

80
00:04:58,264 --> 00:04:59,462
That's the only thing you're--

81
00:04:59,464 --> 00:05:02,532
"Hi, i want
To put my penis in...

82
00:05:02,534 --> 00:05:05,335
The lowest hole
In your head."

83
00:05:11,409 --> 00:05:12,809
I was never good at that.

84
00:05:12,811 --> 00:05:14,812
Like, i was very bad
At being single,

85
00:05:14,814 --> 00:05:16,579
Which is a problem,
Because i'm divorced,

86
00:05:16,581 --> 00:05:18,015
So i'm single again.

87
00:05:18,017 --> 00:05:20,451
After ten years
of marriage, and--

88
00:05:20,453 --> 00:05:22,719
No, here.
Cut the shit.

89
00:05:22,721 --> 00:05:24,455
Don't even start
With that noise

90
00:05:24,457 --> 00:05:26,323
Like a puppy died.

91
00:05:26,325 --> 00:05:29,092
Let me tell you something.

92
00:05:29,094 --> 00:05:31,061
Let me tell you something.

93
00:05:31,063 --> 00:05:32,495
And this is important,

94
00:05:32,497 --> 00:05:34,798
Because someday one of your
Friends is gonna get divorced.

95
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,633
It's gonna happen.
And they're gonna tell you.

96
00:05:36,635 --> 00:05:38,268
Don't go, "oh, i'm sorry."

97
00:05:38,270 --> 00:05:39,669
That's a stupid thing to say.

98
00:05:39,671 --> 00:05:41,204
It really is.

99
00:05:41,206 --> 00:05:42,839
First of all,
You're making 'em feel bad

100
00:05:42,841 --> 00:05:46,309
For being really happy,
Which isn't fair.

101
00:05:49,447 --> 00:05:51,381
And second--let me explain
Something to you.

102
00:05:51,383 --> 00:05:54,151
Divorce is always good news.

103
00:05:54,153 --> 00:05:57,187
I know that sounds weird,
But it's true,

104
00:05:57,189 --> 00:06:02,425
Because no good marriage
Has ever ended in divorce.

105
00:06:04,428 --> 00:06:06,997
It's really that simple.

106
00:06:06,999 --> 00:06:09,599
That's never ha--
That would be sad,

107
00:06:09,601 --> 00:06:11,869
If two people were married
And they were really happy,

108
00:06:11,871 --> 00:06:15,472
And they just had a great thing,
And then they got divorced,

109
00:06:15,474 --> 00:06:18,008
That would be really sad.

110
00:06:18,010 --> 00:06:21,845
But that has happened
Zero times.

111
00:06:21,847 --> 00:06:25,182
Literally zero.

112
00:06:25,184 --> 00:06:28,786
Ray Charles
Has killed more Jews

113
00:06:28,788 --> 00:06:31,955
Than happy marriages
Have ended in divorce.

114
00:06:35,794 --> 00:06:37,161
So if your friend
Got divorced,

115
00:06:37,163 --> 00:06:38,962
It means things were bad,
And now they're--

116
00:06:38,964 --> 00:06:40,230
I mean, they're better.

117
00:06:40,232 --> 00:06:41,932
They're not good.
Life is shit wall to wall,

118
00:06:41,934 --> 00:06:42,933
But they're better,

119
00:06:42,935 --> 00:06:44,902
So you should be happy.

120
00:06:44,904 --> 00:06:47,003
But the part that's difficult

121
00:06:47,005 --> 00:06:50,640
Is being single at 41
After ten years of marriage

122
00:06:50,642 --> 00:06:51,875
And two kids.

123
00:06:51,877 --> 00:06:54,044
It's--that's like
Having a bunch of money

124
00:06:54,046 --> 00:06:57,147
In the currency of a country
That doesn't exist anymore.

125
00:06:57,149 --> 00:06:59,016
Like...

126
00:06:59,018 --> 00:07:02,953
Like i found 500 million
Prussian francs.

127
00:07:08,559 --> 00:07:10,593
I can't really take
Advantage of being single,

128
00:07:10,595 --> 00:07:12,663
Because i didn't--
I didn't expect to be single.

129
00:07:12,665 --> 00:07:13,930
I'm not prepared.

130
00:07:13,932 --> 00:07:15,199
I didn't think i'd ever be--

131
00:07:15,201 --> 00:07:16,533
I didn't keep
This shit up.

132
00:07:16,535 --> 00:07:17,568
You understand?

133
00:07:17,570 --> 00:07:21,572
I didn't maintain
Any of this

134
00:07:21,574 --> 00:07:25,275
At presentation condition.

135
00:07:25,277 --> 00:07:27,110
It's function only.

136
00:07:27,112 --> 00:07:28,945
It was not...

137
00:07:28,947 --> 00:07:31,381
I didn't think
I would need it that way.

138
00:07:31,383 --> 00:07:33,450
I thought i was gonna be shoving
It into the same person

139
00:07:33,452 --> 00:07:35,652
Every three months
Till one of us died.

140
00:07:35,654 --> 00:07:39,422
That's...

141
00:07:39,424 --> 00:07:43,793
What i thought was the nature
of the deployment for this...

142
00:07:43,795 --> 00:07:45,495
I didn't think
I had to be, like,

143
00:07:45,497 --> 00:07:50,266
Appealing to someone
From scratch.

144
00:07:50,268 --> 00:07:52,135
It's like having a--

145
00:07:52,137 --> 00:07:55,739
It's like having a '73
Dodge dart in your backyard.

146
00:07:55,741 --> 00:07:58,409
And it's been sitting back there
With grass growing--

147
00:07:58,411 --> 00:08:00,644
You don't have any--
It's not an old mustang.

148
00:08:00,646 --> 00:08:03,380
You have no plans
To restore that dart.

149
00:08:03,382 --> 00:08:07,417
You don't even see it
When you look out the window.

150
00:08:07,419 --> 00:08:11,688
And now you find out
That's your only way to work.

151
00:08:11,690 --> 00:08:14,958
You need that car now.

152
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:17,528
And you're like,
"Oh, shit, i--

153
00:08:17,530 --> 00:08:19,730
"I didn't take--
It's got bees in it.

154
00:08:19,732 --> 00:08:23,167
"I didn't take care of it.

155
00:08:23,169 --> 00:08:26,937
"It's full of bees.

156
00:08:26,939 --> 00:08:28,538
"There's a family of mice
Living in the tailpipe.

157
00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:30,574
I can't take that to work."

158
00:08:34,712 --> 00:08:36,512
I have no single instincts.

159
00:08:36,514 --> 00:08:38,248
I know too much to be single.

160
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:40,050
I know everything
That happens now.

161
00:08:40,052 --> 00:08:41,585
That's no good for single.

162
00:08:41,587 --> 00:08:44,387
You got to be optimistic
To be single.

163
00:08:44,389 --> 00:08:46,256
Stupid.
You have to be stupid.

164
00:08:46,258 --> 00:08:48,892
That's what optimistic means,
You know?

165
00:08:48,894 --> 00:08:51,128
It means stupid.

166
00:08:51,130 --> 00:08:52,762
An optimist
Is somebody who goes,

167
00:08:52,764 --> 00:08:54,764
"Hey, maybe something
Nice will happen."

168
00:08:54,766 --> 00:08:57,401
Why the fuck would anything nice
Ever happen?

169
00:08:57,403 --> 00:09:00,637
What are you, stupid?

170
00:09:00,639 --> 00:09:02,906
But that's the attitude
You have to be to be single.

171
00:09:02,908 --> 00:09:05,676
You have to look at somebody
And go, "ooh, maybe..."

172
00:09:05,678 --> 00:09:06,877
I don't look at it that way,

173
00:09:06,879 --> 00:09:08,411
Even when i see somebody
I'm attracted to.

174
00:09:08,413 --> 00:09:09,479
I was at a gym the other day.

175
00:09:09,481 --> 00:09:10,914
Why? Why?

176
00:09:10,916 --> 00:09:12,749
I'm at a gym.

177
00:09:12,751 --> 00:09:14,985
I'm just wearing shorts.

178
00:09:14,987 --> 00:09:16,586
That's all i'm doing there.

179
00:09:16,588 --> 00:09:19,957
Just standing there.

180
00:09:28,299 --> 00:09:30,100
And i look over,
And there's a girl on the--

181
00:09:30,102 --> 00:09:35,805
You know, with a ponytail,
And she's on this thing--

182
00:09:35,807 --> 00:09:37,507
And i'm looking at her,
And i'm like,

183
00:09:37,509 --> 00:09:41,411
"Oh, she's awesome.

184
00:09:41,413 --> 00:09:44,581
Shit."

185
00:09:44,583 --> 00:09:47,050
But then i start thinking,
Wait a minute.

186
00:09:47,052 --> 00:09:50,420
I'm single. I'm on the market.
I have value.

187
00:09:50,422 --> 00:09:52,556
I could say something
To her.

188
00:09:52,558 --> 00:09:54,591
I could just walk up
And say something.

189
00:09:54,593 --> 00:09:57,594
And i'm trying to think--
"What am i gonna say?"

190
00:09:57,596 --> 00:10:02,265
What does--what do i look like
To somebody like that?

191
00:10:02,267 --> 00:10:03,967
And then i realize
It's been way too long.

192
00:10:03,969 --> 00:10:08,071
I've just been standing there,
Staring at her.

193
00:10:08,073 --> 00:10:09,639
[Grunts]

194
00:10:09,641 --> 00:10:12,709
I want her!

195
00:10:17,215 --> 00:10:20,183
I have no identity
In the single world.

196
00:10:20,185 --> 00:10:23,187
I can't--i look at them,
I don't know what they're doing.

197
00:10:23,189 --> 00:10:25,221
I--i tried just jerking off

198
00:10:25,223 --> 00:10:26,490
<I>to Girls Gone Wild
The other day.

199
00:10:26,492 --> 00:10:28,659
Just to re-enter
The community that way.

200
00:10:28,661 --> 00:10:30,326
Just to feel part of it.

201
00:10:30,328 --> 00:10:31,528
And i bought it.

202
00:10:31,530 --> 00:10:33,063
Not the commercial
On Comedy Central.

203
00:10:33,065 --> 00:10:34,798
I paid money like a grown-up.

204
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,299
I put my credit card down

205
00:10:36,301 --> 00:10:38,434
And waited for it
To come to my house.

206
00:10:38,436 --> 00:10:40,003
I'm an adult.

207
00:10:40,005 --> 00:10:42,438
<I>so i'm trying to jerk off
To Girls Gone Wild.

208
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:43,840
I can't do it,
'Cause i'm a father.

209
00:10:43,842 --> 00:10:45,175
I'm too old.

210
00:10:45,177 --> 00:10:51,114
I'm just getting mad
At everybody in the video.

211
00:10:51,116 --> 00:10:53,416
I'm like, "you fucking
Irresponsible bitches.

212
00:10:53,418 --> 00:10:55,719
Go back to school.
What are you doing down there?"

213
00:11:00,191 --> 00:11:02,059
"There's two wars
And a depression.

214
00:11:02,061 --> 00:11:04,527
"Put your--get the oil
off your tits and study,

215
00:11:04,529 --> 00:11:06,563
For fuck's sake."

216
00:11:12,203 --> 00:11:15,439
I just don't look at a woman
As a pair of tits anymore,

217
00:11:15,441 --> 00:11:17,507
And i wish i did,
'Cause i could get laid easier,

218
00:11:17,509 --> 00:11:18,474
'Cause that's what it takes.

219
00:11:18,476 --> 00:11:20,243
Just to go--
[Grunting]

220
00:11:22,613 --> 00:11:23,646
But i can't now.

221
00:11:23,648 --> 00:11:24,747
Like, i went to a club.

222
00:11:24,749 --> 00:11:26,382
I went to a club,
You know, like, a...

223
00:11:26,384 --> 00:11:28,518
[Imitates thumping club music]
Like, a club.

224
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:30,921
And i'm standing there
Looking at all the people,

225
00:11:30,923 --> 00:11:32,856
And there's the women--
The hot chicks.

226
00:11:32,858 --> 00:11:34,358
The hot girl at the bar.

227
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:35,692
You know when you see them,

228
00:11:35,694 --> 00:11:37,327
That's just--she's a hot girl
At the bar.

229
00:11:37,329 --> 00:11:39,996
She's got the--
Got the shirt and the skirt,

230
00:11:39,998 --> 00:11:40,997
And the boots.

231
00:11:40,999 --> 00:11:42,232
Those three lines.

232
00:11:42,234 --> 00:11:45,435
It's, like, some
Perfect ratio that they hit

233
00:11:45,437 --> 00:11:48,505
With those three lines,
And you--

234
00:11:48,507 --> 00:11:50,274
And they're all
Standing there like that.

235
00:11:50,276 --> 00:11:51,808
And i used to look
At somebody like that.

236
00:11:51,810 --> 00:11:53,109
I'm like,
"Wow, she's an angel.

237
00:11:53,111 --> 00:11:55,679
What could i ever say
To make her like me?"

238
00:11:55,681 --> 00:11:58,114
Now i look at her and i'm like,
"What is that?

239
00:11:58,116 --> 00:11:59,215
"Is that even a person?

240
00:11:59,217 --> 00:12:01,384
"What the fuck
Kind of person is that?

241
00:12:01,386 --> 00:12:04,654
Is that an identity even?
Who would want to be that?"

242
00:12:04,656 --> 00:12:05,822
I have two daughters.

243
00:12:05,824 --> 00:12:08,325
I pray they don't
Grow up to be the--

244
00:12:08,327 --> 00:12:10,627
The hot girl at the bar.
What kind of--

245
00:12:10,629 --> 00:12:11,761
"Hey, what do you do?"

246
00:12:11,763 --> 00:12:13,029
"People want to fuck me."

247
00:12:13,031 --> 00:12:14,531
Really? That's it?

248
00:12:14,533 --> 00:12:16,666
"Yeah.

249
00:12:16,668 --> 00:12:19,502
"I go to this club, and they
Want to fuck me over here.

250
00:12:19,504 --> 00:12:20,970
"Ha ha.

251
00:12:20,972 --> 00:12:23,773
Not you.
Ha ha."

252
00:12:27,412 --> 00:12:30,347
And their male counterparts
Are even more useless.

253
00:12:30,349 --> 00:12:31,748
The guys.

254
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:34,718
The dudes--the going out
To get laid dudes.

255
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:37,321
You know those guys
That walk in packs of nine

256
00:12:37,323 --> 00:12:39,122
Down the bar street.

257
00:12:39,124 --> 00:12:40,791
The going out
To get laid guys.

258
00:12:40,793 --> 00:12:42,359
They all got the same
Button-up, stripy,

259
00:12:42,361 --> 00:12:47,364
Going out to get laid
Shirt on.

260
00:12:47,366 --> 00:12:49,599
They all got the same stride,

261
00:12:49,601 --> 00:12:52,168
And there's one short
Guy behind them like--

262
00:12:58,976 --> 00:13:00,610
And they--
They're all out to get--

263
00:13:00,612 --> 00:13:02,679
Like, who's gonna
Fuck all nine of you?

264
00:13:02,681 --> 00:13:04,948
What is the fantasy here?

265
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:08,718
Are you gonna see nine women
In the same configuration,

266
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:10,854
And just all--?

267
00:13:10,856 --> 00:13:15,391
Are you all gonna walk
Into a giant vagina somewhere?

268
00:13:15,393 --> 00:13:17,727
"Ha ha! Dude!"

269
00:13:22,467 --> 00:13:24,301
And then later they're in front
of a pizza place,

270
00:13:24,303 --> 00:13:25,602
Just angry at each other.

271
00:13:25,604 --> 00:13:28,905
"You said there was pussy there,
You idiot!"

272
00:13:28,907 --> 00:13:31,441
"Shut up!"

273
00:13:31,443 --> 00:13:34,210
Then they beat up a stranger
And get the energy out that way.

274
00:13:34,212 --> 00:13:36,646
"Faggot!"

275
00:13:42,119 --> 00:13:44,087
Those are the most
dangerous people,

276
00:13:44,089 --> 00:13:46,356
Are dudes
That didn't get laid.

277
00:13:46,358 --> 00:13:48,725
They're just fucking--
[Grumbles]

278
00:13:52,596 --> 00:13:56,900

Coming out of their eyes.

00:14:04,476 --> 00:14:06,009
I love dudes
That hang out together

282
00:14:06,011 --> 00:14:07,377
And do the whole--

283
00:14:07,379 --> 00:14:08,811
I saw this group of guys,

284
00:14:08,813 --> 00:14:10,713
And one of 'em was such a guy,

285
00:14:10,715 --> 00:14:13,016
He had it turned up so high
That it was crazy.

286
00:14:13,018 --> 00:14:14,451
His friends
Were kind of normal.

287
00:14:14,453 --> 00:14:16,153
He was like--

288
00:14:18,222 --> 00:14:21,458
I'm like, "what? Is that--
That can't be real.

289
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:23,826
That can't be a personality."

290
00:14:23,828 --> 00:14:25,395
Does he do that at 4:00
In the morning

291
00:14:25,397 --> 00:14:27,297
When he's peeing
And nobody's in his apartment?

292
00:14:27,299 --> 00:14:28,998
He's like--

293
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:38,574
And he kept doing that gesture
That guys like to do.

294
00:14:38,576 --> 00:14:40,676
The...

295
00:14:40,678 --> 00:14:42,212
That's my favorite
Dumb guy gesture.

00:14:42,214 --> 00:14:44,514
Yeah. Pfft.

297
00:14:44,516 --> 00:14:47,150
Pffsh, yeah, right.

298
00:14:50,221 --> 00:14:52,021
I always wonder,
What if there was a guy

299
00:14:52,023 --> 00:14:53,823
Who, whenever he does this,

300
00:14:53,825 --> 00:14:57,860
He has to finish.

301
00:14:57,862 --> 00:15:00,363
Like, just some guy
Who works in your office.

302
00:15:00,365 --> 00:15:02,765
You ask him a question.
"Hey, is Bill in yet?"

00:15:02,767 --> 00:15:04,901
"Yeah,
Like, he's ever on time."

It's always an odd moment
In a guy's life,

The second after you come,

313
00:16:13,472 --> 00:16:17,373
And you're like--

Ah, fuck."

And then
You're just like--

You're like the Hulk coming
back down to the other guy.

And there's a dead guy here.

I don't know what happened.

And leave town again.

00:17:02,519 --> 00:17:03,553
So this is
A beautiful theater.

00:17:03,555 --> 00:17:05,789
I like what i do,

331
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:07,724
Because i get to work
In a lot of different places.

332
00:17:07,726 --> 00:17:10,860
And, uh, recently
I did a show in New Jersey

333
00:17:10,862 --> 00:17:15,865
In the auditorium
of a technical High School.

334
00:17:15,867 --> 00:17:19,903
I forgot that existed.

Are narrowed down.

That's--

337
00:17:26,044 --> 00:17:29,946
'Cause we tell our children,
"You can do anything you want."

"You can do anything."

339

We take kids--

Like, they're 15.
They're young.

"You can do eight things.

To eight for you."

These people are stupid.

Because i'm stupid.

I really am stupid,
And it bothers me.

Here's how my brain works.

351
00:18:06,351 --> 00:18:08,918
It's stupidity
Followed by self-hatred

352
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:10,920
And then further analysis.

353
00:18:10,922 --> 00:18:13,990
It's not a very efficient
System of thought.

354
00:18:13,992 --> 00:18:16,659
I have these dumb thoughts,
"Duh,"

355
00:18:16,661 --> 00:18:18,561
And then i go, "what the fuck
Is wrong with you?"

356
00:18:18,563 --> 00:18:23,766
And then i figure it out.

357
00:18:23,768 --> 00:18:25,668
But the impulse
Is always stupid.

358
00:18:25,670 --> 00:18:27,603
Like, i saw this guy
In New York one day,

359
00:18:27,605 --> 00:18:29,172
And he's walking his dog,

360
00:18:29,174 --> 00:18:30,206
And this is what i saw.

361
00:18:30,208 --> 00:18:31,708
The guy's got a--
He's got a coffee

362
00:18:31,710 --> 00:18:33,943
And a dog on a leash,
And a phone.

363
00:18:33,945 --> 00:18:35,045
He's on the phone.

364
00:18:35,047 --> 00:18:36,546
So he's got
His phone like this,

365
00:18:36,548 --> 00:18:39,849
And the dog's leash is going
From the phone hand to the dog.

366
00:18:39,851 --> 00:18:41,518
And i look at this and i go,

367
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:44,287
"Oh, he's got, like,
A dog phone."

368
00:18:48,592 --> 00:18:52,194
Like, that thought
Sincerely inhabited me

369
00:18:52,196 --> 00:18:54,664
For, like, a full minute.

370
00:18:54,666 --> 00:18:57,066
I'm going, "oh, i wonder
What the benefits are

371
00:18:57,068 --> 00:19:01,103
To hooking
Your phone up to a dog."

372
00:19:01,105 --> 00:19:02,605
And then the other part of me
Had to go,

373
00:19:02,607 --> 00:19:04,774
"Why the fuck
Would that exist?

374
00:19:04,776 --> 00:19:07,711
You asshole."

375
00:19:11,048 --> 00:19:14,150
I had a string of bad--
Dumb thoughts the other day.

376
00:19:14,152 --> 00:19:17,086
I was--i don't remember
What town i was in.

377
00:19:17,088 --> 00:19:18,354
I was on the road.

378
00:19:18,356 --> 00:19:20,456
I was just standing
In front of my hotel.

379
00:19:20,458 --> 00:19:22,525
It was 5:00 in the afternoon.

380
00:19:22,527 --> 00:19:24,527
That's usually what i'm doing
At 5:00 in the afternoon.

381
00:19:24,529 --> 00:19:26,896
Just standing in front
of my hotel.

382
00:19:26,898 --> 00:19:29,265
Because i've been
Inside all day.

383
00:19:29,267 --> 00:19:31,600
Just with the jacking off
And the ice cream.

384
00:19:31,602 --> 00:19:33,069
It's just horrible.

385
00:19:33,071 --> 00:19:35,604
It's, like, a horrible thing.

386
00:19:35,606 --> 00:19:37,073
All day.

387
00:19:37,075 --> 00:19:40,176
Just depths of fucking hell.

388
00:19:40,178 --> 00:19:42,345
Just--i wake up,
I get, like, chicken wings.

389
00:19:42,347 --> 00:19:44,213
Shit nobody eats
At 10:00 a.M.

390
00:19:44,215 --> 00:19:47,083
Like, really--hot wings
And i eat 'em all,

391
00:19:47,085 --> 00:19:49,152
And then i'm like, "uh..."

392
00:19:49,154 --> 00:19:51,320
So i get ice cream
To cool it off, you know?

393
00:19:51,322 --> 00:19:53,589
Like...
And then i feel worse,

394
00:19:53,591 --> 00:19:56,859
So i jack off and pass out.

395
00:19:56,861 --> 00:19:59,929
I turn off my phone
In case my kids call.

396
00:19:59,931 --> 00:20:03,366
I can't fucking face anybody.

397
00:20:03,368 --> 00:20:05,734
I wake up covered with
Three kinds of shame glaze

398
00:20:05,736 --> 00:20:08,404
Just covering my body.

399
00:20:14,445 --> 00:20:16,045
And so right around 5:00
In the afternoon

400
00:20:16,047 --> 00:20:17,480
It starts getting dark,

401
00:20:17,482 --> 00:20:19,482
And i'm like, "i got to be
In the daylight just once."

402
00:20:19,484 --> 00:20:21,717
I have to at least
One time in the day

403
00:20:21,719 --> 00:20:23,386
Be in the daylight.

404
00:20:23,388 --> 00:20:25,854
And that's--
I just stand there. That's it.

405
00:20:25,856 --> 00:20:28,924
Like a fucking mental patient
In a bathrobe.

406
00:20:28,926 --> 00:20:30,793
Just--

407
00:20:40,003 --> 00:20:43,038
Cigarette burns
On the robe and shit.

408
00:20:45,242 --> 00:20:48,111
Some girl telling me
She got married.

409
00:20:48,113 --> 00:20:50,045
I'm not listening.

410
00:20:50,047 --> 00:20:52,848
"Daddy,
This is my husband."

411
00:20:59,389 --> 00:21:02,691
That's what it feels like,
Anyway.

412
00:21:02,693 --> 00:21:04,927
And i started
Looking at people,

413
00:21:04,929 --> 00:21:06,695
And they're all crispy-clothed

414
00:21:06,697 --> 00:21:09,332
And rosy-cheeked
And full of purpose,

415
00:21:09,334 --> 00:21:12,101
And they're making me
Feel worse.

416
00:21:12,103 --> 00:21:13,902
And i'm about to go back
In the hotel

417
00:21:13,904 --> 00:21:17,340
And jack off another time.

418
00:21:17,342 --> 00:21:18,841
And then i look
Across the street

419
00:21:18,843 --> 00:21:19,876
And i see this couple,

420
00:21:19,878 --> 00:21:21,978
And they were just striking.

421
00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:23,279
They were a beautiful couple.

422
00:21:23,281 --> 00:21:26,749
It was a beautiful woman
With a beautiful man.

423
00:21:26,751 --> 00:21:28,818
I'll say he's beautiful.
I got no problem with it.

424
00:21:28,820 --> 00:21:29,819
I'll suck his dick too.

425
00:21:29,821 --> 00:21:30,987
I don't need your permission.

426
00:21:30,989 --> 00:21:32,455
I don't care.

427
00:21:32,457 --> 00:21:36,926
Walk right over there
And suck his dick.

428
00:21:36,928 --> 00:21:39,628
I mean, i never did that,
But i'm 41.

429
00:21:39,630 --> 00:21:40,964
Maybe i'll do
The second half gay.

430
00:21:40,966 --> 00:21:42,899
I don't know.

431
00:21:46,737 --> 00:21:48,371
It remains an option.

432
00:21:48,373 --> 00:21:50,139
There's got to be
Something to it.

433
00:21:50,141 --> 00:21:51,707
Those folks
Are having a good time.

434
00:21:51,709 --> 00:21:56,212
They have parades.

435
00:21:56,214 --> 00:21:58,547
They--there's no parades
For how i get laid.

436
00:21:58,549 --> 00:22:00,449
They have parades.

437
00:22:00,451 --> 00:22:02,018
Marching down the street

438
00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:03,686
To celebrate that
They blow each other

439
00:22:03,688 --> 00:22:06,822
And fuck each other
In the ass.

440
00:22:06,824 --> 00:22:08,658
Smush their vaginas together,

441
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:10,793
Or whatever that one is.

442
00:22:13,396 --> 00:22:15,264
Whatever wonderful thing
Those folks are doing

443
00:22:15,266 --> 00:22:23,039
That's none of my business.

444
00:22:23,041 --> 00:22:24,640
So i--okay,
So i'm looking at the couple,

445
00:22:24,642 --> 00:22:27,643
And they're walking
On the other side of the street,

446
00:22:27,645 --> 00:22:29,344
And they have a child with them.

447
00:22:29,346 --> 00:22:30,780
But i can't see their child,

448
00:22:30,782 --> 00:22:32,715
'Cause there's, like,
A dumpster and some other stuff.

449
00:22:32,717 --> 00:22:34,283
I just see, like,
A little head.

450
00:22:34,285 --> 00:22:36,986
And i'm waiting, i'm curious
What their kid looks like,

451
00:22:36,988 --> 00:22:38,187
Because they're so beautiful.

452
00:22:38,189 --> 00:22:39,522
Maybe i want
To fuck their kid.

453
00:22:39,524 --> 00:22:40,523
I don't know.

454
00:22:40,525 --> 00:22:44,760
[Laughs]

455
00:22:44,762 --> 00:22:47,063
That--that's just me
Saying something terrible

456
00:22:47,065 --> 00:22:49,365
Because it makes me laugh
That it upsets you.

457
00:22:49,367 --> 00:22:51,367
That's all that is.
Just so you know.

458
00:22:51,369 --> 00:22:55,304
It's just--it's just enjoyable
To me that you're upset.

459
00:22:55,306 --> 00:22:58,174
That's all it is.
I'm not gonna fuck a kid.

460
00:22:58,176 --> 00:23:00,276
I wouldn't do that.
Maybe a dead kid.

461
00:23:00,278 --> 00:23:02,111
Who are you hurting?
He's dead.

462
00:23:02,113 --> 00:23:05,281
Who are you hurting?

463
00:23:05,283 --> 00:23:08,284
I'm not saying i would kill
A kid and fuck him.

464
00:23:08,286 --> 00:23:10,820
I'm saying if i found
A dead kid in a field

465
00:23:10,822 --> 00:23:13,022
And it wasn't raining,
I might take a shot.

466
00:23:13,024 --> 00:23:14,190
I don't know.

467
00:23:14,192 --> 00:23:16,392
I haven't been
In that situation.

468
00:23:16,394 --> 00:23:19,862
All right.

469
00:23:19,864 --> 00:23:21,463
[Laughs]

470
00:23:21,465 --> 00:23:24,133
Oh, sorry.

471
00:23:26,804 --> 00:23:27,971
All right. Okay.

472
00:23:27,973 --> 00:23:31,908
So i'm looking
At the couple, and...

473
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:33,075
[Sighs]

474
00:23:37,514 --> 00:23:38,981
They got a kid with them,

475
00:23:38,983 --> 00:23:40,215
And i'm curious
What their kid looks like.

476
00:23:40,217 --> 00:23:41,383
And they come
Around the corner,

477
00:23:41,385 --> 00:23:42,952
And they're--and this
Is a true story.

478
00:23:42,954 --> 00:23:44,219
It wasn't a kid.

479
00:23:44,221 --> 00:23:50,192
It was a little old chinese
Woman walking next to them.

480
00:23:50,194 --> 00:23:51,861
And here's what
My dumb brain tells me.

481
00:23:51,863 --> 00:23:56,532
I go, "oh, that's what
Their child is like."

482
00:23:56,534 --> 00:23:59,301
Not like, "oh, she's
A separate person.

483
00:23:59,303 --> 00:24:00,703
She's not with them."

484
00:24:00,705 --> 00:24:02,005
I'm like,
"Oh, that young couple

485
00:24:02,007 --> 00:24:05,141
"Gave birth to a tiny,
Elderly chinese woman.

486
00:24:05,143 --> 00:24:07,476
Isn't that interesting?"

487
00:24:07,478 --> 00:24:08,945
And then the other
Part of me had to go,

488
00:24:08,947 --> 00:24:10,813
"Dude, you--

489
00:24:10,815 --> 00:24:13,482
"Yeah, that's what happened.
Yes.

490
00:24:13,484 --> 00:24:17,286
Asshole."

491
00:24:17,288 --> 00:24:19,088
And then i was looking
At the little old chinese lady.

492
00:24:19,090 --> 00:24:21,157
She was--there was
A beauty to her.

493
00:24:21,159 --> 00:24:22,491
She's just tiny, little,
Old ch--

494
00:24:22,493 --> 00:24:24,493
I was staring at her
'Cause i was fascinated by her.

495
00:24:24,495 --> 00:24:25,761
I don't know anybody like her,

496
00:24:25,763 --> 00:24:29,232
And i am so not
A little old chinese lady.

497
00:24:29,234 --> 00:24:31,533
That i--i was like,
"What are her thoughts?"

498
00:24:31,535 --> 00:24:33,102
That was what
I was burning inside with.

499
00:24:33,104 --> 00:24:34,837
What is she thinking
Right now?

500
00:24:34,839 --> 00:24:36,071
I can never know.

501
00:24:36,073 --> 00:24:37,807
And i really--the dumb brain

502
00:24:37,809 --> 00:24:39,408
Is telling me
That she's just thinking--

503
00:24:39,410 --> 00:24:42,277
[Imitates chinese]

504
00:24:42,279 --> 00:24:45,748
That's how dumb i am.

505
00:24:45,750 --> 00:24:51,054
That i think chinese
Gibberish that i made up...

506
00:24:52,389 --> 00:24:56,559
Is in her
Actually chinese mind.

507
00:24:56,561 --> 00:24:57,359
That's all.
Just--

508
00:24:57,361 --> 00:24:59,795
"Me chinese."
[Imitates chinese]

509
00:25:04,835 --> 00:25:07,503
Course i didn't--i can't know
What she was thinking.

510
00:25:07,505 --> 00:25:08,704
She could be thinking
Anything.

511
00:25:08,706 --> 00:25:10,372
"Eh, black people steal."

512
00:25:10,374 --> 00:25:12,007
So i'm like--

513
00:25:12,009 --> 00:25:13,809
She might--
I'm not saying they steal.

514
00:25:13,811 --> 00:25:15,611
I'm saying that fucking
Racist chinese lady

515
00:25:15,613 --> 00:25:16,712
Might have been thinking it.

516
00:25:16,714 --> 00:25:19,749
She might have been.
It's possible.

517
00:25:24,021 --> 00:25:25,588
And i went to England.

518
00:25:25,590 --> 00:25:27,756
I spent a month there.
I liked England.

519
00:25:27,758 --> 00:25:28,657
Everything's different.

520
00:25:28,659 --> 00:25:29,959
I mean, that's obvious,

521
00:25:29,961 --> 00:25:31,393
But some of
The differences were cool.

522
00:25:31,395 --> 00:25:32,628
I like the money,
The money--

523
00:25:32,630 --> 00:25:35,198
Instead of a dollar bill
They have the pound coin.

524
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:37,399
And it's a coin and
You throw it on the counter.

525
00:25:37,401 --> 00:25:38,400
It felt kind of cool.

526
00:25:38,402 --> 00:25:40,402
Like the old west.

527
00:25:40,404 --> 00:25:43,305
Like going on the--you know,
Being on the dusty trail.

528
00:25:43,307 --> 00:25:47,110
You see a saloon, so you walk
Over to it with your horse.

529
00:25:47,112 --> 00:25:51,948
You throw the rope
Vaguely at the pole outside.

530
00:25:51,950 --> 00:25:54,884
That thing they do.

531
00:25:54,886 --> 00:25:56,185
It's my whole life
On that horse.

532
00:25:56,187 --> 00:26:00,723
Should be fine.
Just...

533
00:26:00,725 --> 00:26:02,892
Walk in the saloon.

534
00:26:02,894 --> 00:26:05,962
"Give me a beer,
The bottle of whiskey,

535
00:26:05,964 --> 00:26:07,663
"And a room for a week,

536
00:26:07,665 --> 00:26:11,433
"Steak dinner, shave
And a haircut and a bath,

537
00:26:11,435 --> 00:26:13,302
"And some new clothes
And a hat and some boots,

538
00:26:13,304 --> 00:26:16,205
And some oats for my horse,
And a woman."

539
00:26:16,207 --> 00:26:18,641
Here you go.
Ping.

540
00:26:18,643 --> 00:26:21,144
That's all.

541
00:26:21,146 --> 00:26:25,081
One heavy coin.
You're fine.

542
00:26:25,083 --> 00:26:30,153
Nobody adds up all those things
You mentioned.

543
00:26:30,155 --> 00:26:34,157
They don't check
To see what coin it was.

544
00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:37,026
The guy just keeps
Drying the glass.

545
00:26:40,564 --> 00:26:42,198
Things were very vague
Back then.

546
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:44,033
Things just cost money.

547
00:26:44,035 --> 00:26:45,367
"Hey, how much is that?"

548
00:26:45,369 --> 00:26:49,238
"Money."

549
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:51,174
In the old english movies,
It was different.

550
00:26:51,176 --> 00:26:52,809
It was a little sack of coins.

551
00:26:52,811 --> 00:26:54,844
Remember that little
Drawstring sack

552
00:26:54,846 --> 00:26:57,180
Tossed over
By some faggy lord

553
00:26:57,182 --> 00:27:00,783
With a ruffled shirt.

554
00:27:00,785 --> 00:27:03,119
Throw it disdainfully down
To some commoner

555
00:27:03,121 --> 00:27:06,355
Who's gonna do something
Beneath his station.

556
00:27:06,357 --> 00:27:10,426
"Follow the girl and report
Back to me at midnight.

557
00:27:10,428 --> 00:27:12,761
"Bring a shovel and a sack

558
00:27:12,763 --> 00:27:17,900
"And two reliable men
Such as yourselves.

559
00:27:17,902 --> 00:27:19,368
"Oh, what's that?
Oh, yes, of course.

560
00:27:19,370 --> 00:27:21,337
Well,
This ought to be sufficient."

561
00:27:21,339 --> 00:27:22,705
Meh, just--shink.

562
00:27:22,707 --> 00:27:24,773
"Oh, thank you, sir."

563
00:27:24,775 --> 00:27:29,045
The guy's so happy
To get a general amount

564
00:27:29,047 --> 00:27:31,280
of some kind
of currency or another.

565
00:27:31,282 --> 00:27:32,648
He didn't, like, count it.

566
00:27:32,650 --> 00:27:34,717
Like, "i think you only gave me
Enough for the shovel.

567
00:27:34,719 --> 00:27:38,687
There's not enough there."

568
00:27:38,689 --> 00:27:41,123
That was a good time
In our economy,

569
00:27:41,125 --> 00:27:43,692
When you needed to have gold
To buy shit.

570
00:27:43,694 --> 00:27:45,828
We might be going back to that
Pretty soon too.

571
00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:48,364
Things are pretty fucked up.

572
00:27:48,366 --> 00:27:50,799
People are a little bit scared.
But you know what?

573
00:27:50,801 --> 00:27:52,201
How bad could it really get?

574
00:27:52,203 --> 00:27:54,202
I mean, most Americans
Have so much crap

575
00:27:54,204 --> 00:27:56,071
You could lose most of it

576
00:27:56,073 --> 00:27:57,773
And still be--
Have more shit

577
00:27:57,775 --> 00:27:59,208
Than the average Canadian,
Even.

578
00:27:59,210 --> 00:28:02,311
Like, we're the fattest
People in the world,

579
00:28:02,313 --> 00:28:03,679
And we just have
All this shit,

580
00:28:03,681 --> 00:28:04,780
And we hate it.

581
00:28:04,782 --> 00:28:07,483
We're just miserable
With our phones.

582
00:28:07,485 --> 00:28:09,418
"Fucking..."
[Murmurs]

583
00:28:09,420 --> 00:28:12,488
Just angry all the time.

584
00:28:12,490 --> 00:28:15,324
And i worry about
The economy failing,

585
00:28:15,326 --> 00:28:16,725
Because we don't--
We can't even--

586
00:28:16,727 --> 00:28:18,627
We're miserable
With a great life.

587
00:28:18,629 --> 00:28:19,995
Like, i don't know
How the fuck

588
00:28:19,997 --> 00:28:21,430
We're gonna deal with, like,

589
00:28:21,432 --> 00:28:23,799
When you got to move your mom
Into the cellar and shit

590
00:28:23,801 --> 00:28:27,936
And, like, have, like,
Serious problems.

591
00:28:27,938 --> 00:28:29,771
Because we have, like--
Up till now,

592
00:28:29,773 --> 00:28:31,807
We have white--
We have white people problems

593
00:28:31,809 --> 00:28:33,109
In America,
That's what we have.

594
00:28:33,111 --> 00:28:34,910
White people problems.
You know what that is?

595
00:28:34,912 --> 00:28:36,412
That's where your life
Is amazing,

596
00:28:36,414 --> 00:28:40,649
So you just make shit up
To be upset about.

597
00:28:40,651 --> 00:28:42,851
People in other countries
Have real problems.

598
00:28:42,853 --> 00:28:44,086
Like, "oh, shit,

599
00:28:44,088 --> 00:28:45,754
They're cutting off
All our heads today."

600
00:28:45,756 --> 00:28:47,489
Things like that.

601
00:28:51,794 --> 00:28:54,029
Here we make shit up
To be upset about.

602
00:28:54,031 --> 00:28:56,665
"Like, how come i have to choose
A language on the atm machine?

603
00:28:56,667 --> 00:28:58,334
It's bullshit."

604
00:29:04,708 --> 00:29:07,108
"I shouldn't have to do that.

605
00:29:07,110 --> 00:29:10,078
I'm American."

606
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:13,114
God, the shit
We bitch about.

607
00:29:13,116 --> 00:29:14,550
I called American Airlines,

608
00:29:14,552 --> 00:29:17,052
And i got a xstani lady.

609
00:29:17,054 --> 00:29:20,055
And she was in Pakistan.

610
00:29:20,057 --> 00:29:24,226
Only people near my fat,
White body should have jobs.

611
00:29:29,966 --> 00:29:31,467
I'll tell you what, though.

612
00:29:31,469 --> 00:29:32,735
When i call American Airlines

613
00:29:32,737 --> 00:29:33,836
And i get the Pakistani lady,

614
00:29:33,838 --> 00:29:35,637
I hang up and i call again.

615
00:29:35,639 --> 00:29:36,872
I do.

616
00:29:36,874 --> 00:29:38,340
I'm gonna tell you honestly.

617
00:29:38,342 --> 00:29:39,808
And it's not because
I don't like her,

618
00:29:39,810 --> 00:29:41,710
And it's not because
She doesn't speak english,

619
00:29:41,712 --> 00:29:44,079
'Cause she speaks
Way better than i do.

620
00:29:44,081 --> 00:29:47,048
She's just a better person.
It's so clear.

621
00:29:47,050 --> 00:29:49,117
And i know--here's why
I don't like talking to her.

622
00:29:49,119 --> 00:29:50,953
'Cause i know she doesn't
Give a shit

623
00:29:50,955 --> 00:29:54,189
About me and
My white people problems.

624
00:29:54,191 --> 00:29:55,791
I want to talk
To the lady from Texas,

625
00:29:55,793 --> 00:29:57,559
Who's--
"Well, how can i help you?"

626
00:29:57,561 --> 00:29:59,060
That's the lady i want.

627
00:29:59,062 --> 00:30:00,362
I just know when i--

628
00:30:00,364 --> 00:30:01,330
[Pakistani accent]
"Hello, American--"

629
00:30:01,332 --> 00:30:02,365
"Oh, fuck.
You don't care."

630
00:30:02,367 --> 00:30:03,999
There's no way.
Why would you?

631
00:30:04,001 --> 00:30:05,401
I'm in my underwear.

632
00:30:05,403 --> 00:30:08,136
"Hi, i have a layover
In Dallas that's really long,

633
00:30:08,138 --> 00:30:09,438
And i was wondering if--"

634
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:10,906
And she's like,
"Oh, really?

635
00:30:10,908 --> 00:30:13,675
"I haven't had a clean glass
of water in ten years, okay?

636
00:30:13,677 --> 00:30:15,477
"Two of my kids
Died this morning.

637
00:30:15,479 --> 00:30:17,012
"I still came to work,
You fat shit.

638
00:30:17,014 --> 00:30:18,514
"I can hear your fat
Over the phone.

639
00:30:18,516 --> 00:30:20,616
Why don't you hang up
And kill yourself?"

640
00:30:20,618 --> 00:30:22,818
Why would she care?

641
00:30:26,857 --> 00:30:28,690
But we just--God.

642
00:30:28,692 --> 00:30:30,158
Standing at the atm.

643
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:34,329
"I can't believe
They make me go like this.

644
00:30:34,331 --> 00:30:36,565
Stupid."

645
00:30:36,567 --> 00:30:38,901
What the fuck
Are you complaining about?

646
00:30:38,903 --> 00:30:43,672
You push a button and money
Comes out a fucking slot.

647
00:30:49,579 --> 00:30:51,080
It didn't used to be that way.

648
00:30:51,082 --> 00:30:53,915
When i was younger,
You had to go in the bank.

649
00:30:53,917 --> 00:30:56,185
Remember that?
You had to go inside the bank.

650
00:30:56,187 --> 00:30:57,553
Now you look in the bank,

651
00:30:57,555 --> 00:30:59,555
You're like, "what are those
People doing in there?

652
00:30:59,557 --> 00:31:02,057
Are they cleaning?
The money's out here."

653
00:31:07,030 --> 00:31:08,997
It's amazing how different
Shit is now,

654
00:31:08,999 --> 00:31:10,666
And it hasn't been this way
For a long time.

655
00:31:10,668 --> 00:31:11,867
It's been a very short time.

656
00:31:11,869 --> 00:31:14,303
Everybody has a phone
In their pocket.

657
00:31:14,305 --> 00:31:15,437
It didn't used to be
You had a phone--

658
00:31:15,439 --> 00:31:16,872
Just a few years ago,

659
00:31:16,874 --> 00:31:18,807
Nobody had their phone.

660
00:31:18,809 --> 00:31:21,877
It was just the phone.

661
00:31:21,879 --> 00:31:23,945
It was this thing, the phone,

662
00:31:23,947 --> 00:31:27,416
That was in a room
In your house.

663
00:31:27,418 --> 00:31:29,418
And then you had to dial
This fucking thing.

664
00:31:29,420 --> 00:31:31,287
There was a rotor,

665
00:31:31,289 --> 00:31:32,954
And you had to turn it
And go--

666
00:31:32,956 --> 00:31:35,657
[Imitates rotary phone]

667
00:31:35,659 --> 00:31:38,360
You actually hated people
With zeros in their numbers,

668
00:31:38,362 --> 00:31:39,561
'Cause they made you do--

669
00:31:39,563 --> 00:31:41,997
Well, this guy's got
A zero and a nine.

670
00:31:41,999 --> 00:31:44,166
How badly do i want to talk
To that piece of shit?

671
00:31:44,168 --> 00:31:47,970
That's too much work.

672
00:31:47,972 --> 00:31:50,773
Now we have this,
Which is amazing.

673
00:31:50,775 --> 00:31:53,675
We have these phones that you
Can call in an air strike.

674
00:31:53,677 --> 00:31:56,245
You can look at the top
of your own head.

675
00:31:56,247 --> 00:31:58,180
It's amazing, this shit,

676
00:31:58,182 --> 00:32:00,515
And it's wasted
On the shittiest generation

677
00:32:00,517 --> 00:32:02,785
of piece of shit assholes
That ever fucking lived.

678
00:32:02,787 --> 00:32:04,987
I swear to God.
We are.

679
00:32:04,989 --> 00:32:08,223
We're the worst people so far.

680
00:32:08,225 --> 00:32:10,025
Because we have
This beautiful thing,

681
00:32:10,027 --> 00:32:11,226
And we hate it.

682
00:32:11,228 --> 00:32:13,195
We're just--
"Fucking thing."

683
00:32:13,197 --> 00:32:15,831
I don't--
Never saw a person going,

684
00:32:15,833 --> 00:32:17,032
"Look at what
My phone can do."

685
00:32:17,034 --> 00:32:18,466
Nobody does that.

686
00:32:18,468 --> 00:32:22,137
They all go--
"Fucking thing, it sucks.

687
00:32:22,139 --> 00:32:24,372
I can't get it to--"

688
00:32:24,374 --> 00:32:26,741
Give it a second,
Would you?

689
00:32:26,743 --> 00:32:29,444
Could you give it a second?

690
00:32:29,446 --> 00:32:31,313
It's going to space.

691
00:32:31,315 --> 00:32:36,418
Can you give it a second
To get back from space?

692
00:32:36,420 --> 00:32:39,254
Is the speed of light
Too slow for you?

693
00:32:39,256 --> 00:32:41,690
You non-contributing,
Product sponge cunt?

694
00:32:41,692 --> 00:32:43,391
Can you just wait?

695
00:32:43,393 --> 00:32:48,230
Can you just take
A little breath?

696
00:32:48,232 --> 00:32:51,867
Just wait for that picture of
Axl rose to get on your phone.

697
00:32:51,869 --> 00:32:54,469
Like it even fucking mattered
What you were doing.

698
00:32:54,471 --> 00:32:58,040
Like it was even important.

699
00:32:58,042 --> 00:32:59,607
We're all just so mad.

700
00:32:59,609 --> 00:33:01,710
"I hate my phone.
It sucks!"

701
00:33:01,712 --> 00:33:03,145
No, it doesn't.

702
00:33:03,147 --> 00:33:05,580
It's amazing.

703
00:33:05,582 --> 00:33:07,216
The shittiest cell phone
In the world

704
00:33:07,218 --> 00:33:09,351
Is a miracle.

705
00:33:09,353 --> 00:33:12,687
Your life sucks
Around the phone.

706
00:33:14,690 --> 00:33:18,160
Why are you so mad at it?

707
00:33:18,162 --> 00:33:19,829
People say
The craziest shit.

708
00:33:19,831 --> 00:33:24,366
"I--i hate Verizon."

709
00:33:24,368 --> 00:33:26,735
What are you talking about?

710
00:33:26,737 --> 00:33:28,570
How can that feeling exist?

711
00:33:28,572 --> 00:33:32,374
"I hate Verizon!"

712
00:33:32,376 --> 00:33:34,442
"Why? Did they fire you
And take away your pension?"

713
00:33:34,444 --> 00:33:38,546
"No, it just--couple of times
It was weird for a second."

714
00:33:38,548 --> 00:33:40,949
[Grumbles]

715
00:33:40,951 --> 00:33:45,420
"I hate them!"

716
00:33:45,422 --> 00:33:46,855
Hate Verizon.

717
00:33:46,857 --> 00:33:48,757
Well, make your own, then.

718
00:33:48,759 --> 00:33:51,693
You go make one.

719
00:33:51,695 --> 00:33:52,828
Make your own network.

720
00:33:52,830 --> 00:33:56,131
Get some hubcaps
And climb some trees.

721
00:33:56,133 --> 00:34:00,969
See how close
Yours is to perfect.

722
00:34:00,971 --> 00:34:02,438
Why would it be perfect?

723
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:04,339
Really,
It's as good as it is.

724
00:34:04,341 --> 00:34:06,808
Why do we expect it
To be fucking perfect

725
00:34:06,810 --> 00:34:07,809
All the fucking time?

726
00:34:07,811 --> 00:34:08,810
We're not contributing.

727
00:34:08,812 --> 00:34:10,412
We're not helping it be perfect.

728
00:34:10,414 --> 00:34:13,581
We don't even know what--
What is involved.

729
00:34:13,583 --> 00:34:15,884
Do you have any idea
What is involved

730
00:34:15,886 --> 00:34:17,852
In taking your thing
That you said

731
00:34:17,854 --> 00:34:21,189
That nobody needs
To ever hear ever,

732
00:34:21,191 --> 00:34:24,393
When you go--
"Hey, what's up, dude."

733
00:34:24,395 --> 00:34:26,562
[Blows raspberry]

734
00:34:26,564 --> 00:34:30,132
And a little, invisible,
Magic angel takes it, and--

735
00:34:30,134 --> 00:34:31,901
[Whooshes]

736
00:34:35,171 --> 00:34:37,672
God damn it.

737
00:34:37,674 --> 00:34:39,975
Ho--"when did you
Send me that text?"

738
00:34:39,977 --> 00:34:42,610
If i sent it to you
A month ago, it's amazing.

739
00:34:42,612 --> 00:34:46,815
Whenever it gets to you,
It's amazing.

740
00:34:46,817 --> 00:34:48,249
Whenever it gets to you

741
00:34:48,251 --> 00:34:49,984
In your chosen fucking font.

742
00:34:49,986 --> 00:34:54,923
It's incredible.

743
00:34:54,925 --> 00:34:56,625
I don't know.
I'm not that old. I'm 41.

744
00:34:56,627 --> 00:34:58,427
But i'm still amazed
At the shit in my life.

745
00:34:58,429 --> 00:34:59,961
I'm amazed at the shit
In the world.

746
00:34:59,963 --> 00:35:03,165
I was on a plane once,
Like about a month ago,

747
00:35:03,167 --> 00:35:05,033
And they had high-speed,
Wireless internet on the plane,

748
00:35:05,035 --> 00:35:06,401
And they had never
Done that before.

749
00:35:06,403 --> 00:35:08,003
They explained to us
That we were, like,

750
00:35:08,005 --> 00:35:09,170
One of the first aircraft.

751
00:35:09,172 --> 00:35:11,606
And i opened up my laptop,
And i'm online.

752
00:35:11,608 --> 00:35:13,041
I'm looking
At youtube and shit

753
00:35:13,043 --> 00:35:13,975
While we're flying.

754
00:35:13,977 --> 00:35:15,510
And then it broke down.

755
00:35:15,512 --> 00:35:17,713
And the woman says, "i'm sorry,
But we have to fix the internet,

756
00:35:17,715 --> 00:35:19,113
So it's down
For the rest of the flight."

757
00:35:19,115 --> 00:35:24,286
The guy next to me goes,
"It's fucking bullshit."

758
00:35:24,288 --> 00:35:27,222
I'm, like, "dude, how does
The world owe you something

759
00:35:27,224 --> 00:35:30,192
You didn't even know existed
30 seconds ago?"

760
00:35:33,129 --> 00:35:34,663
People on planes
Are the worst.

761
00:35:34,665 --> 00:35:36,532
People on planes,
They complain.

762
00:35:36,534 --> 00:35:38,433
They get off the plane,
They come to your house,

763
00:35:38,435 --> 00:35:41,569
And they tell you about
Your whole flight experience.

764
00:35:41,571 --> 00:35:44,305
And they make it sound
Like it was fucking a--

765
00:35:44,307 --> 00:35:46,041
A cattle car
In Poland in the '40s.

766
00:35:46,043 --> 00:35:47,042
They just make it--

767
00:35:47,044 --> 00:35:51,446
"That was the worst
Day of my life.

768
00:35:51,448 --> 00:35:54,850
"I had to sit on the runway

769
00:35:54,852 --> 00:35:57,252
For 40 minutes."

770
00:35:57,254 --> 00:35:58,987
That's a story
In this country.

771
00:35:58,989 --> 00:36:01,089
That's a fucking hardship,

772
00:36:01,091 --> 00:36:04,226
That you had to sit
On the runway.

773
00:36:04,228 --> 00:36:06,128
People will listen
To that story.

774
00:36:06,130 --> 00:36:08,029
They'll stop doing the dishes
And turn around and go,

775
00:36:08,031 --> 00:36:10,398
"Oh, my God, really?
For 40 minutes?

776
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:14,535
That's awful.
You should sue them."

777
00:36:18,341 --> 00:36:21,576
"I had to sit on the runway
For 40 minutes."

778
00:36:21,578 --> 00:36:23,445
Oh, my God, really?
What happened then?

779
00:36:23,447 --> 00:36:27,316
Did you fly through the air
Like a bird?

780
00:36:27,318 --> 00:36:28,750
Incredibly?

781
00:36:28,752 --> 00:36:33,188
Did you soar
Into the clouds impossibly?

782
00:36:33,190 --> 00:36:37,492
Did you partake
In the miracle of human flight?

783
00:36:37,494 --> 00:36:40,662
And then land softly
On giant tires

784
00:36:40,664 --> 00:36:41,964
That you couldn't
Even conceive

785
00:36:41,966 --> 00:36:43,998
How they fucking
Put air in them?

786
00:36:48,304 --> 00:36:50,973
How dare you.

787
00:36:50,975 --> 00:36:53,742
Bitching about flying.

788
00:36:53,744 --> 00:36:55,544
"I had to pay
For my sandwich."

789
00:36:55,546 --> 00:36:59,848
You're flying!

790
00:36:59,850 --> 00:37:03,452
You're sitting in a chair
In the sky.

791
00:37:06,756 --> 00:37:09,224
You're like a greek myth
Right now.

792
00:37:12,228 --> 00:37:14,062
"But it doesn't
Go back very far,

793
00:37:14,064 --> 00:37:17,198
And it's sort of
Squishing my knees."

794
00:37:22,204 --> 00:37:24,406
The Wright Brothers would
kick us all right in the cunt

795
00:37:24,408 --> 00:37:27,209
If they knew.

796
00:37:27,211 --> 00:37:32,981
If--if you could go back
In time to Orville Wright

797
00:37:32,983 --> 00:37:36,718
And go, "hey, dude, i had to sit
On the runway for 40 minutes."

798
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:38,453
And he'd be like,
"Oh, shit,

799
00:37:38,455 --> 00:37:40,889
Well, let's
Not even bother, then."

800
00:37:42,091 --> 00:37:43,725
"Hey, Wendell, shut it down.

801
00:37:43,727 --> 00:37:45,727
"They make you wait for a bit.

802
00:37:45,729 --> 00:37:49,798
That hardly seems worth it."

803
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:51,900
There's always delays.

804
00:37:51,902 --> 00:37:53,501
That's what everybody
Complains about.

805
00:37:53,503 --> 00:37:54,836
There's always delays
When i fly.

806
00:37:54,838 --> 00:37:56,972
Really? Delays.
It's too slow.

807
00:37:56,974 --> 00:37:58,840
Air travel's too slow.

808
00:37:58,842 --> 00:38:01,577
New York to California
In six hours.

809
00:38:01,579 --> 00:38:05,146
That used to take 30 years,
To do that,

810
00:38:05,148 --> 00:38:07,849
And a bunch of you would die
On the way there.

811
00:38:07,851 --> 00:38:10,819
You'd get shot in the neck
With an arrow and you'd go--

812
00:38:10,821 --> 00:38:12,788
[Gags]
And fall down.

813
00:38:12,790 --> 00:38:14,723
And the other passengers
Would just bury you

814
00:38:14,725 --> 00:38:18,860
And put a stick there with your
Hat on it and keep walking.

815
00:38:18,862 --> 00:38:20,462
And one of 'em
Would fuck your wife

816
00:38:20,464 --> 00:38:23,732
And have three babies.

817
00:38:23,734 --> 00:38:26,134
And all the old people
Would die.

818
00:38:26,136 --> 00:38:27,803
You'd be a whole different
Group of people

819
00:38:27,805 --> 00:38:32,006
By the time
You got to California.

820
00:38:32,008 --> 00:38:33,775
Now you watch
An Adam Sandler movie

821
00:38:33,777 --> 00:38:36,445
And you take a big, runny dump
And you're there.

822
00:38:43,819 --> 00:38:46,388
I was, uh, i was flying
About a week ago,

823
00:38:46,390 --> 00:38:48,256
And, uh, i was in the airport,

824
00:38:48,258 --> 00:38:49,757
And i saw this really old man,

825
00:38:49,759 --> 00:38:51,426
And he's on--
He's on a wheelchair.

826
00:38:51,428 --> 00:38:52,661
I can fucking hear
That shit,

827
00:38:52,663 --> 00:38:53,629
So back the fuck off.

828
00:38:53,631 --> 00:38:55,630
I can hear
It in your headsets.

829
00:38:55,632 --> 00:38:58,366
Just careful.
Or turn them down.

830
00:38:58,368 --> 00:39:00,902
Sorry to fuck up
The entire show for that,

831
00:39:00,904 --> 00:39:01,903
But i could hear--

832
00:39:01,905 --> 00:39:03,104
[Imitates earpiece chatter]

833
00:39:03,106 --> 00:39:04,105
"Get closer to him.

00:39:04,107 --> 00:39:05,139
"No, it's okay, it's fine.

835
00:39:05,141 --> 00:39:06,908
Get closer to him.
He won't mind."

836
00:39:10,713 --> 00:39:12,614
All right.
Wait a second.

837
00:39:12,616 --> 00:39:15,083
[Cheers and applause]

838
00:39:23,359 --> 00:39:27,195
Okay, uh,
This about where i was?

839
00:39:27,197 --> 00:39:28,864
Okay.

840
00:39:28,866 --> 00:39:29,764
[Audience member shouts]

841
00:39:29,766 --> 00:39:30,832
That's right.
I was on a--

842
00:39:30,834 --> 00:39:35,437
I was in the, um...

843
00:39:35,439 --> 00:39:36,905
I was in the airport.

844
00:39:36,907 --> 00:39:38,673
Ugh...

845
00:39:38,675 --> 00:39:40,441
Tot--just drenched right now.

846
00:39:40,443 --> 00:39:43,278
Totally drenched.

847
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:46,381
It's like i peed.
It's crazy.

848
00:39:52,121 --> 00:39:54,823
Okay, so i'm in the airport,

849
00:39:54,825 --> 00:39:56,524
And i'm going through security,

850
00:39:56,526 --> 00:39:59,127
And they bring this old man
In a wheelchair,

851
00:39:59,129 --> 00:40:01,696
And he was...

852
00:40:01,698 --> 00:40:02,931
Crazy old.

853
00:40:02,933 --> 00:40:05,000
I mean, he was the oldest thing
I've ever seen.

854
00:40:05,002 --> 00:40:07,402
I've been
To museums and shit.

855
00:40:07,404 --> 00:40:09,036
This dude...

856
00:40:09,038 --> 00:40:11,038
I didn't know
There had been as much time

857
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:12,507
As this guy was old.

858
00:40:12,509 --> 00:40:14,676
I mean,
He was at least forever.

859
00:40:14,678 --> 00:40:16,411
He was at least that old.

860
00:40:16,413 --> 00:40:19,681
Just tiny,
Little nosferatu hands

861
00:40:19,683 --> 00:40:21,383
And eggy head.

862
00:40:21,385 --> 00:40:25,654
Just one of those...

863
00:40:25,656 --> 00:40:27,255
So frail.

864
00:40:27,257 --> 00:40:28,690
It was like
Just the atmosphere

865
00:40:28,692 --> 00:40:30,258
Was crushing him
Into a diamond.

866
00:40:30,260 --> 00:40:33,495
Just...
[Screeches]

867
00:40:36,565 --> 00:40:38,033
And they're
Pushing him through,

868
00:40:38,035 --> 00:40:38,867
And i'm not the only per--

869
00:40:38,869 --> 00:40:40,368
Like,
He was parting the people,

870
00:40:40,370 --> 00:40:42,170
'Cause people were going,
"What the fuck?

871
00:40:42,172 --> 00:40:45,406
That's crazy.
He's really old!"

872
00:40:48,811 --> 00:40:49,945
And they take him
Through security,

873
00:40:49,947 --> 00:40:51,246
And, you know,
If you're really old

874
00:40:51,248 --> 00:40:52,413
Or you're in a wheelchair,

875
00:40:52,415 --> 00:40:53,949
You can't go through
The metal detector

876
00:40:53,951 --> 00:40:54,950
If you're in a wheelchair,

877
00:40:54,952 --> 00:40:56,451
So they take you
To secondary clearance,

878
00:40:56,453 --> 00:40:57,986
Which is far more stringent.

879
00:40:57,988 --> 00:41:01,089
Like, the oldest and feeblest
People get the highest scrutiny.

880
00:41:01,091 --> 00:41:02,658
So they take him over there,

881
00:41:02,660 --> 00:41:05,493
And he's--i mean, he doesn't
Even look good for infinity.

882
00:41:05,495 --> 00:41:06,528
He's not even like, a--

883
00:41:06,530 --> 00:41:08,263
He's, like--

884
00:41:08,265 --> 00:41:11,733
Got a whole thing going.

885
00:41:11,735 --> 00:41:13,234
And they take him over,

886
00:41:13,236 --> 00:41:16,071
And they start checking him
For weapons.

887
00:41:16,073 --> 00:41:18,006
Like, thor--like,
What do you got there, huh?

888
00:41:18,008 --> 00:41:19,641
Like, checking him.

889
00:41:19,643 --> 00:41:20,642
And they lift him--

890
00:41:20,644 --> 00:41:21,943
I swear to God,
They picked him up

891
00:41:21,945 --> 00:41:23,779
Gently out of the wheelchair
By the shoulders,

892
00:41:23,781 --> 00:41:26,581
And he's standing between
These two guys like this,

893
00:41:26,583 --> 00:41:30,785
And they're going--
[Imitates beeping]

894
00:41:30,787 --> 00:41:35,156
And i'm like, "really?
Is that the guy, fellas?

895
00:41:35,158 --> 00:41:37,426
"You think that's the guy?

896
00:41:37,428 --> 00:41:40,161
Do you want to maybe
Let him go?"

897
00:41:40,163 --> 00:41:42,297
Let him enjoy the last
Ten seconds of his life

898
00:41:42,299 --> 00:41:44,999
Doing something else.

899
00:41:45,001 --> 00:41:46,902
What--what is he gonna--

900
00:41:46,904 --> 00:41:48,003
Even if he pulled it off,

901
00:41:48,005 --> 00:41:50,772
He deserves whatever he wanted,
Really.

902
00:41:50,774 --> 00:41:52,473
What is he gonna do?

903
00:41:52,475 --> 00:41:55,043
Even if he had a grenade--

904
00:41:55,045 --> 00:41:56,812
Let him keep it.

905
00:42:00,316 --> 00:42:01,750
And i know what they'd say.

906
00:42:01,752 --> 00:42:03,684
They'd be like, "well,
Where do you draw the line?"

907
00:42:03,686 --> 00:42:04,920
He--this is the line.

908
00:42:04,922 --> 00:42:06,922
This guy right here,
He's the actual line.

909
00:42:06,924 --> 00:42:09,090
It's very clear.

910
00:42:17,199 --> 00:42:18,867
There's always somebody going
Through security who's like,

911
00:42:18,869 --> 00:42:21,636
"I don't want
To take off my shoes.

912
00:42:21,638 --> 00:42:23,572
"Stupid.

913
00:42:23,574 --> 00:42:25,607
I'm not a terrorist."

914
00:42:25,609 --> 00:42:26,641
Oh, that's right.

915
00:42:26,643 --> 00:42:27,976
We only make
Terrorists do that.

916
00:42:27,978 --> 00:42:31,078
I'm sorry.

917
00:42:31,080 --> 00:42:32,914
[Grumbles]

918
00:42:32,916 --> 00:42:34,783
That's what we sound like now.

919
00:42:34,785 --> 00:42:37,085
[Grumbles]

920
00:42:37,087 --> 00:42:38,220
Just the whole country.

921
00:42:38,222 --> 00:42:39,621
We're like
Fat eighth graders.

922
00:42:39,623 --> 00:42:41,490
All of us.

923
00:42:41,492 --> 00:42:43,158
Just--

924
00:42:43,160 --> 00:42:45,460
Not fair.

925
00:42:45,462 --> 00:42:46,828
You ever listen to people?

926
00:42:46,830 --> 00:42:47,996
When i was in England,

927
00:42:47,998 --> 00:42:50,364
I went into this cafe
Full of AfghaniJ people,

928
00:42:50,366 --> 00:42:51,432
And they're--they just had

929
00:42:51,434 --> 00:42:52,834
Crackly energy
To their language.

930
00:42:52,836 --> 00:42:54,068
I don't know
What they were saying,

931
00:42:54,070 --> 00:42:57,038
But it was like--
[Imitates language]

932
00:42:57,040 --> 00:42:58,372
There's energy.

933
00:42:58,374 --> 00:43:00,474
We don't have that anymore.

934
00:43:00,476 --> 00:43:01,542
You ever listen to people?

935
00:43:01,544 --> 00:43:03,345
You ever listen to what
People really sound like?

936
00:43:03,347 --> 00:43:05,013
The other day i was
In some whatever coffee--

937
00:43:05,015 --> 00:43:06,181
I don't know,
You can only be in six places.

938
00:43:06,183 --> 00:43:08,049
Whichever one i was in.

939
00:43:08,051 --> 00:43:11,519
And i'm listening to just fat
White people talk to each other.

940
00:43:11,521 --> 00:43:12,921
These two fat white guys
Behind me.

941
00:43:12,923 --> 00:43:14,088
One of 'em is like...

942
00:43:14,090 --> 00:43:17,025
[Mumbling, slurring]

943
00:43:29,672 --> 00:43:31,339
And his friend's like,
"I know, it's...

944
00:43:31,341 --> 00:43:34,876
[Mumbling, slurring]

945
00:43:34,878 --> 00:43:37,278
...Obama."

946
00:43:40,115 --> 00:43:41,816
These two women are talking.
One of them's like...

947
00:43:41,818 --> 00:43:44,786
[Higher-pitched mumbling,
Slurring]

948
00:43:51,160 --> 00:43:52,527
"I know, it's..."

949
00:43:52,529 --> 00:43:55,797
[Higher-pitched mumbling,
Slurring]

950
00:43:55,799 --> 00:43:58,833
"...Stephanie."

951
00:44:04,707 --> 00:44:07,742
Anyway, i was listening
To the two guys,

952
00:44:07,744 --> 00:44:10,278
And one of 'em used a word

953
00:44:10,280 --> 00:44:12,013
That really pissed me off,

954
00:44:12,015 --> 00:44:13,714
Because it was how he used it.

955
00:44:13,716 --> 00:44:14,916
He used the word
"Hilarious."

956
00:44:14,918 --> 00:44:16,584
That's one of those words
That we use--

957
00:44:16,586 --> 00:44:18,519
That we don't care
What it means.

958
00:44:18,521 --> 00:44:21,056
We go right for the top shelf
With our words now.

959
00:44:21,058 --> 00:44:22,890
We don't think about
How we talk.

960
00:44:22,892 --> 00:44:25,226
We just say the--
Right to the fucking just--

961
00:44:25,228 --> 00:44:27,162
"Dude, it was amazing.

962
00:44:27,164 --> 00:44:28,963
It was amazing."

963
00:44:28,965 --> 00:44:31,900
<I>really?
You were amazed?

964
00:44:31,902 --> 00:44:37,038
You were amazed by
A basket of chicken wings?

965
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:38,973
Really?

966
00:44:38,975 --> 00:44:40,708
Amazing.

967
00:44:40,710 --> 00:44:42,143
What are you gonna--

968
00:44:42,145 --> 00:44:45,246
What are you gonna do
With the rest of your life now?

969
00:44:45,248 --> 00:44:47,849
What if something
Really happens to you?

970
00:44:47,851 --> 00:44:49,884
What if Jesus comes down
From the sky

971
00:44:49,886 --> 00:44:52,153
And makes love to you
All night long,

972
00:44:52,155 --> 00:44:56,057
And leaves the new,
Living lord in your belly?

973
00:44:58,394 --> 00:45:00,628
What are you gonna call that?

974
00:45:00,630 --> 00:45:04,732
You used "amazing"
On a basket of chicken wings.

975
00:45:04,734 --> 00:45:08,136
You've limited yourself verbally
To a shit life.

976
00:45:10,573 --> 00:45:11,739
All these words we use.

977
00:45:11,741 --> 00:45:12,974
"Genius."
That's--

978
00:45:12,976 --> 00:45:14,542
You can--anybody
Can be a genius now.

979
00:45:14,544 --> 00:45:16,511
It used to be
You had to have a thought

980
00:45:16,513 --> 00:45:17,878
No one ever had before,

981
00:45:17,880 --> 00:45:20,181
Or you had to invent a number.

982
00:45:20,183 --> 00:45:24,519
Now it's like, "hey, i got a cup
In case we need another cup."

983
00:45:24,521 --> 00:45:27,422
"Dude, you're a genius."

984
00:45:35,530 --> 00:45:37,699
So these guys,
They used "hilarious."

985
00:45:37,701 --> 00:45:39,701
And i remember
The context exactly,

986
00:45:39,703 --> 00:45:40,802
Because i had
The hate recorder

987
00:45:40,804 --> 00:45:42,070
Running in
The back of my head.

988
00:45:42,072 --> 00:45:43,537
I was just standing there
Fucking angry.

989
00:45:43,539 --> 00:45:44,538
I'm listening to 'em.

990
00:45:44,540 --> 00:45:45,639
One guy says to the other guy,

991
00:45:45,641 --> 00:45:48,776
He goes, uh,
"Hey, dude, so, uh...

992
00:45:48,778 --> 00:45:49,844
[Breathes heavily]

993
00:45:49,846 --> 00:45:53,080
So guess who i saw today."

994
00:45:53,082 --> 00:45:55,716
And his friend goes,
"Who?"

995
00:45:55,718 --> 00:45:57,285
I swear to God
That's how he said it.

996
00:45:57,287 --> 00:46:01,189
It just slid out.
Just "who?"

997
00:46:01,191 --> 00:46:02,857
I was like,
"Tighten your lips up, man.

998
00:46:02,859 --> 00:46:04,626
Make an effort."

999
00:46:04,628 --> 00:46:06,994
"Who."
That's how a person talks.

1000
00:46:06,996 --> 00:46:08,563
This guy,
He's just secreting words

1001
00:46:08,565 --> 00:46:10,665
Out of the front of his head.

1002
00:46:10,667 --> 00:46:13,668
"Who?"

1003
00:46:13,670 --> 00:46:17,705
[Sputtering, slurring]

1004
00:46:17,707 --> 00:46:22,410
So his friend goes,
"I saw Lisa today."

1005
00:46:22,412 --> 00:46:26,514
And he goes,
"That's hilarious."

1006
00:46:30,986 --> 00:46:34,923
How the fuck
Is that hilarious?

1007
00:46:34,925 --> 00:46:37,224
That you saw Lisa.

1008
00:46:37,226 --> 00:46:39,794
Is Lisa a poodle
On her hind legs?

1009
00:46:39,796 --> 00:46:41,495
How is that hilarious?

1010
00:46:41,497 --> 00:46:44,699
Was she standing next to
Jerry Lewis when he was younger?

1011
00:46:44,701 --> 00:46:46,834
How the fuck
Is that hilarious?

1012
00:46:46,836 --> 00:46:50,404
Do you know
What "hilarious" means?

1013
00:46:50,406 --> 00:46:51,806
"Hilarious" means so funny

1014
00:46:51,808 --> 00:46:56,043
That you almost went insane
When you heard that sh--

1015
00:46:56,045 --> 00:47:01,015
It's just so funny
That it almost ruined your life.

1016
00:47:01,017 --> 00:47:04,419
You're homeless now because
You can't cope or reason anymore

1017
00:47:04,421 --> 00:47:06,153
Because that hilarious thing

1018
00:47:06,155 --> 00:47:07,988
Just shattered your mind,

1019
00:47:07,990 --> 00:47:10,558
And three months later you got
Shit and leaves in your hair,

1020
00:47:10,560 --> 00:47:13,460
And you're drenched
In pee in the gutter.

1021
00:47:13,462 --> 00:47:15,062
That's how funny
"Hilarious" is.

1022
00:47:15,064 --> 00:47:16,297
I don't know
This Lisa cunt,

1023
00:47:16,299 --> 00:47:17,465
But she ain't that funny.

1024
00:47:17,467 --> 00:47:19,634
There's just no way.

1025
00:47:19,636 --> 00:47:24,071
She's that funny on sight?

1026
00:47:24,073 --> 00:47:25,106
Fuck her.

1027
00:47:25,108 --> 00:47:26,674
Seriously.
I hope she's dead.

1028
00:47:26,676 --> 00:47:28,142
I really do.
I hate her.

1029
00:47:28,144 --> 00:47:30,645
I hope she died today.

1030
00:47:30,647 --> 00:47:33,648
Weirdly and horribly.

1031
00:47:33,650 --> 00:47:35,350
I hope the person
She loved most

1032
00:47:35,352 --> 00:47:36,817
Pushed her off a cliff,

1033
00:47:36,819 --> 00:47:39,721
And she was just falling and
Screaming the whole way down,

1034
00:47:39,723 --> 00:47:41,188
Never accepting it.

1035
00:47:41,190 --> 00:47:43,391
And then Superman
swooped her up

1036
00:47:43,393 --> 00:47:45,493
And then dropped her
from higher.

1037
00:47:45,495 --> 00:47:48,429
[Laughter and applause]

1038
00:47:50,832 --> 00:47:53,501
I seriously hope
That happened...

1039
00:47:53,503 --> 00:47:56,170
To stupid Lisa.

1040
00:47:56,172 --> 00:47:57,972
With her one tit
bigger than the other,

1041
00:47:57,974 --> 00:48:00,475
And her fucking frizzy hair,

1042
00:48:00,477 --> 00:48:02,543
And her...

1043
00:48:02,545 --> 00:48:04,912
Her big nose.

1044
00:48:04,914 --> 00:48:06,180
Fucking Jew.

1045
00:48:06,182 --> 00:48:07,982
[Laughter]

1046
00:48:07,984 --> 00:48:10,685
What am i doing?

1047
00:48:10,687 --> 00:48:13,288
I've lost my mind.

1048
00:48:17,660 --> 00:48:20,227
"Jew" is a funny word,
Because--

1049
00:48:20,229 --> 00:48:22,697
It is.
Because "Jew" is the only word

1050
00:48:22,699 --> 00:48:26,000
That is the polite thing
to call a group of people

1051
00:48:26,002 --> 00:48:29,870
And the slur
for the same group.

1052
00:48:29,872 --> 00:48:31,406
Most groups
have a good and a bad--

1053
00:48:31,408 --> 00:48:34,642
Theirs, the same word,
Just with a little stank on it,

1054
00:48:34,644 --> 00:48:38,713
And it becomes a terrible
Thing to call a person.

1055
00:48:38,715 --> 00:48:40,815
'Cause you can say.
"He's a Jew." It's fine.

1056
00:48:40,817 --> 00:48:42,083
<I>but "he's a Jew."

1057
00:48:42,085 --> 00:48:44,018
Like, that's all it takes.

1058
00:48:48,824 --> 00:48:51,326
I wish the president
Would slip one into a speech

1059
00:48:51,328 --> 00:48:52,393
That's just on the border,

1060
00:48:52,395 --> 00:48:53,861
Just to fuck
With people's heads.

1061
00:48:53,863 --> 00:48:55,563
Just in the middle,
You know.

1062
00:48:55,565 --> 00:48:57,031
"We all got to get along
In this country.

1063
00:48:57,033 --> 00:48:58,199
"We need everybody.

1064
00:48:58,201 --> 00:48:59,967
<I>"blacks and whites
And christians and Jews,

1065
00:48:59,969 --> 00:49:02,703
And let's just try to..."

1066
00:49:02,705 --> 00:49:04,805
Hmm.

1067
00:49:04,807 --> 00:49:06,441
I don't...
Can't call him on it,

1068
00:49:06,443 --> 00:49:08,376
But that seemed inappropriate.

1069
00:49:13,715 --> 00:49:16,017
Fucking Lisa.

1070
00:49:16,019 --> 00:49:18,452
Fucking Lisa, man.

1071
00:49:18,454 --> 00:49:20,621
It's just--
It didn't deserve that.

1072
00:49:20,623 --> 00:49:21,489
The story didn't deserve--

1073
00:49:21,491 --> 00:49:22,690
Here's what he should have said.

1074
00:49:22,692 --> 00:49:23,925
This is what
That story deserved.

1075
00:49:23,927 --> 00:49:25,693
It should have been like,
"I saw Lisa today."

1076
00:49:25,695 --> 00:49:28,095
The other guy should have said,
"That happened."

1077
00:49:28,097 --> 00:49:30,532
That's it.
That's all it deserved.

1078
00:49:30,534 --> 00:49:32,433
He should have said,
"That happened,"

1079
00:49:32,435 --> 00:49:34,402
And then they just
Should have started making out.

1080
00:49:34,404 --> 00:49:35,536
I don't know why i wanted that.

1081
00:49:35,538 --> 00:49:37,472
I just wanted these
Two old fat guys

1082
00:49:37,474 --> 00:49:39,573
To just start blowing
Each other on the floor.

1083
00:49:39,575 --> 00:49:41,042
Not even gay blowing.

1084
00:49:41,044 --> 00:49:42,944
Just awkward,
Heterosexual sucking,

1085
00:49:42,946 --> 00:49:44,545
That they don't know
What they're doing.

1086
00:49:44,547 --> 00:49:46,347
And they don't even get hard
Partway through.

1087
00:49:46,349 --> 00:49:49,016
They're just sucking
Each other's soft penises.

1088
00:49:49,018 --> 00:49:50,251
And they're both crying,

1089
00:49:50,253 --> 00:49:55,556
'Cause they're embarrassed
And confused.

1090
00:49:55,558 --> 00:49:57,492
Now that would be hilarious.

1091
00:49:57,494 --> 00:50:00,761
Then you would have a story
That you could call hilarious

1092
00:50:00,763 --> 00:50:03,697
Without being accused
of hyperbole.

1093
00:50:11,473 --> 00:50:14,442
It's amazing, the stories that
People think are interesting.

1094
00:50:14,444 --> 00:50:16,177
And that's always one of 'em,

1095
00:50:16,179 --> 00:50:19,013
Is when your friend ran
Into somebody from their past,

1096
00:50:19,015 --> 00:50:20,815
And they can't
Wait to tell you.

1097
00:50:20,817 --> 00:50:22,716
And first they want
To tell you for 40 minutes

1098
00:50:22,718 --> 00:50:24,252
How blown away you're gonna be

1099
00:50:24,254 --> 00:50:26,287
That they saw this person.

1100
00:50:26,289 --> 00:50:30,358
"Dude, you're not gonna believe
Who i saw today."

1101
00:50:30,360 --> 00:50:33,161
Yes, i am.

1102
00:50:33,163 --> 00:50:35,063
Course i am.

1103
00:50:35,065 --> 00:50:37,832
Don't even tell me.
I don't care.

1104
00:50:37,834 --> 00:50:40,435
"No. No, dude.

1105
00:50:40,437 --> 00:50:42,036
"Dude!

1106
00:50:42,038 --> 00:50:45,740
"When you find out--
Holy shit!

1107
00:50:45,742 --> 00:50:47,441
"When you find out who i saw,

1108
00:50:47,443 --> 00:50:50,011
"You are gonna shit in your
Father's mouth when i tell you.

1109
00:50:50,013 --> 00:50:51,679
"I'm serious!

1110
00:50:51,681 --> 00:50:53,748
"When i tell you who i saw,

1111
00:50:53,750 --> 00:50:55,883
"You are gonna
Kill, fuck, and eat

1112
00:50:55,885 --> 00:50:59,053
"Four mexican retarded kids
When i tell you who i saw today.

1113
00:50:59,055 --> 00:51:00,487
"I'm s--you're gonna do that.

1114
00:51:00,489 --> 00:51:03,223
"I'm serious
That you're gonna do that.

1115
00:51:03,225 --> 00:51:04,625
"You're not gonna--

1116
00:51:04,627 --> 00:51:06,160
"You're just gonna
Rip out your asshole

1117
00:51:06,162 --> 00:51:08,229
"And throw it on the wall.

1118
00:51:08,231 --> 00:51:09,396
"It's gonna stick there,

1119
00:51:09,398 --> 00:51:10,698
"And you're gonna
Dive through it

1120
00:51:10,700 --> 00:51:12,734
Into another dimension."

1121
00:51:12,736 --> 00:51:14,702
[Laughs]

1122
00:51:14,704 --> 00:51:17,271
Tell you who i saw today.

1123
00:51:21,710 --> 00:51:24,111
Anyway, i don't know
Why i'm such an asshole.

1124
00:51:24,113 --> 00:51:26,113
I really am.
I have--i'm grumpy.

1125
00:51:26,115 --> 00:51:28,683
I don't--i get impatient
With people quickly, you know?

1126
00:51:28,685 --> 00:51:29,684
I just get tired of--

1127
00:51:29,686 --> 00:51:31,085
When people are boring,

1128
00:51:31,087 --> 00:51:34,289
I want to kill them, you know,
And that's not fair.

1129
00:51:34,291 --> 00:51:35,490
I used to like people more,

1130
00:51:35,492 --> 00:51:36,824
But now i have children,

1131
00:51:36,826 --> 00:51:38,292
And that changes your life.

1132
00:51:38,294 --> 00:51:40,061
It changes your life
In a lot of ways.

1133
00:51:40,063 --> 00:51:42,262
Like, you spend
A lot of time with people

1134
00:51:42,264 --> 00:51:44,098
You never would have chosen
To spend time with.

1135
00:51:44,100 --> 00:51:45,600
Not in a million years.

1136
00:51:45,602 --> 00:51:47,368
I spend whole days
With people i'm like,

1137
00:51:47,370 --> 00:51:49,236
"I never would have
Hung out with you."

1138
00:51:49,238 --> 00:51:50,638
I didn't choose you.

1139
00:51:50,640 --> 00:51:52,072
Our children chose each other

1140
00:51:52,074 --> 00:51:53,708
Based on no criteria,
By the way.

1141
00:51:53,710 --> 00:51:55,275
They're the same size.

1142
00:51:55,277 --> 00:51:56,744
They don't give a shit

1143
00:51:56,746 --> 00:52:00,014
Who they make me
Hang out with.

1144
00:52:00,016 --> 00:52:01,616
My daughter had
A playdate the other day.

1145
00:52:01,618 --> 00:52:03,417
This kid comes over,
And his father brings him,

1146
00:52:03,419 --> 00:52:04,952
And his father
Brings his fucking face

1147
00:52:04,954 --> 00:52:07,488
Into my house.

1148
00:52:07,490 --> 00:52:08,923
And i have to ask it questions

1149
00:52:08,925 --> 00:52:10,525
For an hour and a half.

1150
00:52:10,527 --> 00:52:13,093
"Ugh. What do you do?
I don't care.

1151
00:52:13,095 --> 00:52:15,462
"God damn it.

1152
00:52:15,464 --> 00:52:17,297
"What other shit
Are you passing on

1153
00:52:17,299 --> 00:52:18,666
"To that little faggot
You brought over here

1154
00:52:18,668 --> 00:52:19,767
"To play with my kid?

1155
00:52:19,769 --> 00:52:21,102
"I don't--i hate your son.

1156
00:52:21,104 --> 00:52:22,837
"I hate him.

1157
00:52:22,839 --> 00:52:24,539
He smells."

1158
00:52:24,541 --> 00:52:26,473
Gets too close
When he talks.

1159
00:52:26,475 --> 00:52:27,474
"Can i have raisins?"

1160
00:52:27,476 --> 00:52:31,812
Yes, you can have--
Just...Stand...

1161
00:52:31,814 --> 00:52:33,814
Dude, i'm not--
You're not mine.

1162
00:52:33,816 --> 00:52:35,249
I don't love you.
Do you understand?

1163
00:52:35,251 --> 00:52:37,151
I don't have any--no love.

1164
00:52:37,153 --> 00:52:39,554
None.

1165
00:52:39,556 --> 00:52:41,022
I don't even have an instinct
To protect you.

1166
00:52:41,024 --> 00:52:42,423
I don't care if you die.

1167
00:52:42,425 --> 00:52:45,560
I seriously--i won't
Feel anything if you die.

1168
00:52:45,562 --> 00:52:48,495
I'll have to pretend.
For your dad.

1169
00:52:52,634 --> 00:52:55,570
I like kids.
Parents, i'm not crazy about.

1170
00:52:55,572 --> 00:52:57,638
Most parents--
Like, this whole country,

1171
00:52:57,640 --> 00:52:59,073
Our thing is the children.

1172
00:52:59,075 --> 00:53:00,507
We have to do it all
For the children.

1173
00:53:00,509 --> 00:53:02,376
And, meanwhile,
Nobody gives a shit

1174
00:53:02,378 --> 00:53:04,144
About how
They raise their kids.

1175
00:53:04,146 --> 00:53:05,980
People put minimal effort
Into it.

1176
00:53:05,982 --> 00:53:07,181
They have--their kids--

1177
00:53:07,183 --> 00:53:08,783
They're, like,
Consumers of their kids.

1178
00:53:08,785 --> 00:53:10,384
Like, they want to call
Customer service.

1179
00:53:10,386 --> 00:53:12,587
"Why does he play
Video games all day?

1180
00:53:12,589 --> 00:53:15,189
I don't understand
Why he plays video--"

1181
00:53:15,191 --> 00:53:17,592
Maybe 'cause you bought him
A fucking video game,

1182
00:53:17,594 --> 00:53:19,359
You idiot.

1183
00:53:19,361 --> 00:53:21,896
Throw it a--
Throw it away!

1184
00:53:21,898 --> 00:53:24,398
Who told you
That was a good idea?

1185
00:53:24,400 --> 00:53:26,000
A developing mind.

1186

[Grunts]

1187
00:53:28,337 --> 00:53:32,106
Fucking idiots.

1188
00:53:32,108 --> 00:53:33,708
My kids don't even
Watch television.

1189
00:53:33,710 --> 00:53:35,275
And when i tell
Most other parents that,

1190
00:53:35,277 --> 00:53:36,276
You know what they say?

1191
00:53:36,278 --> 00:53:38,178
They go,
"Aw, fuck you."

1192
00:53:38,180 --> 00:53:40,047
Why?

1193
00:53:40,049 --> 00:53:42,049
"Just 'cause fuck you.

Grow up weirdos.

"'Cause they don't watch
Just fucking anger and colors

1197

00:53:55,931 --> 00:53:57,265
If your kids watch tv,

00:53:57,267 --> 00:53:58,532
Here's what you should do.

1201
00:53:58,534 --> 00:53:59,867
Just--if you think
That's really a good idea

1202
00:53:59,869 --> 00:54:01,168
To have 'em watch tv,

1203
00:54:01,170 --> 00:54:02,803
Next time your kid's
Watching television,

1204
00:54:02,805 --> 00:54:04,471
Just come up behind them when
They don't know you're there,

1205
00:54:04,473 --> 00:54:06,240
And just turn it off
Without any warning.

1206
00:54:06,242 --> 00:54:07,208
Just go--pfft.

1207
00:54:07,210 --> 00:54:08,275

[Screams]

1209
00:54:09,545 --> 00:54:11,578
Do you think
That's a good sign?

1210
00:54:11,580 --> 00:54:14,582
You think it's a sign
That it's healthy for them?

1211
00:54:14,584 --> 00:54:16,183
That when it's taken away
They go--

[Mutters]

1213
00:54:20,054 --> 00:54:22,523
Because you've created
Such a high bar of stimulus

That nothing competes.

00:54:24,894 --> 00:54:27,795
A beautiful day is shit
To a child now.

1216
00:54:27,797 --> 00:54:29,797
A gorgeous, panoramic day

1217
00:54:29,799 --> 00:54:34,401
With hawks catching fucking mice
And flying away

1218
00:54:34,403 --> 00:54:38,639
And bears with fucking fish
In their teeth.

1219
00:54:38,641 --> 00:54:41,875
And the kid's like,
"I want to watch the television!

1220
00:54:41,877 --> 00:54:45,446
This is nothing!"

1221
00:54:45,448 --> 00:54:46,981
That's what's wrong
With our kids.

1222
00:54:46,983 --> 00:54:49,083
They can't just stand
And be a person without--

1223
00:54:49,085 --> 00:54:53,020
Baa! Blah!

1224
00:54:53,022 --> 00:54:54,622
And then the food--

1225
00:54:54,624 --> 00:54:57,858
We feed them food
That tastes like insanity.

1226
00:54:57,860 --> 00:55:00,394
It's insanity, our food.

1227
00:55:00,396 --> 00:55:02,997
Do you under--you should
To be able to give a kid

1228
00:55:02,999 --> 00:55:04,999
An apple, and they go,
"Oh, thank you.

1229
00:55:05,001 --> 00:55:06,701
I love apples."

1230
00:55:06,703 --> 00:55:07,834
Kids can't even taste--

1231
00:55:07,836 --> 00:55:09,904
Apples are like paper to them.

1232
00:55:09,906 --> 00:55:11,405
Because we fill 'em,

1233
00:55:11,407 --> 00:55:12,907
We force them to eat--

1234
00:55:12,909 --> 00:55:15,109
People force their kids
To eat fast food.

1235
00:55:15,111 --> 00:55:16,510
I was in this hamburger--

1236
00:55:16,512 --> 00:55:18,979
This woman's, like, just
Shoving french fries in the--

1237
00:55:18,981 --> 00:55:20,447
"Eat it!"

1238
00:55:20,449 --> 00:55:22,550
The kid's, like,
"Mom, it's salty. It hurts.

1239
00:55:22,552 --> 00:55:24,184
I can't eat anymore."

1240
00:55:24,186 --> 00:55:26,887
"Shut up.
Have a soda."

1241
00:55:28,824 --> 00:55:32,727
We give them msg,
Sugar, and caffeine,

1242
00:55:32,729 --> 00:55:37,265
And, weirdly,
They react to those chemicals.

1243
00:55:37,267 --> 00:55:38,632
And so they yell, "aah."

1244
00:55:38,634 --> 00:55:39,733
And then we hit them.

1245
00:55:39,735 --> 00:55:44,238
What fucking chance
Does a kid have?

1246
00:55:44,240 --> 00:55:46,340
We pump the stuff in there.

1247
00:55:46,342 --> 00:55:48,909
"Aah!"
"Shut up!

1248
00:55:48,911 --> 00:55:52,213
"Stop it.

1249
00:55:52,215 --> 00:55:56,116
Why are you like this?"

1250
00:55:56,118 --> 00:56:00,121
"'Cause i haven't had actual
Nutrition in eight years, mom.

1251
00:56:00,123 --> 00:56:03,390
"I'm dehydrated.

1252
00:56:03,392 --> 00:56:04,592
"Give me water.

1253
00:56:04,594 --> 00:56:06,093
"Pepsi's not water,
You cunt.

1254
00:56:06,095 --> 00:56:09,130
"Give me a glass of water.

1255
00:56:09,132 --> 00:56:11,032
"I'm dying.

1256
00:56:11,034 --> 00:56:14,234
I have sores on my tongue
All the time."

1257
00:56:17,371 --> 00:56:18,839
"And stop hitting me.

1258
00:56:18,841 --> 00:56:21,241
"You're huge.

1259
00:56:21,243 --> 00:56:25,746
"How could you hit me?
That's crazy.

1260
00:56:25,748 --> 00:56:30,217
You're a giant,
And i can't defend myself."

1261
00:56:31,687 --> 00:56:34,888
I really think it's crazy
That we hit our kids.

1262
00:56:34,890 --> 00:56:37,424
It really is--here's the crazy
Part about it.

1263
00:56:37,426 --> 00:56:39,560
Kids are the only people
In the world

1264
00:56:39,562 --> 00:56:41,628
That you're allowed to hit.

1265
00:56:41,630 --> 00:56:43,330
Do you realize that?

1266
00:56:43,332 --> 00:56:44,898
They're the most vulnerable,

1267
00:56:44,900 --> 00:56:47,802
And they're the most destroyed
By being hit,

1268
00:56:47,804 --> 00:56:51,004
But it's totally
Okay to hit them.

1269
00:56:51,006 --> 00:56:52,840
And they're the only ones.

1270
00:56:52,842 --> 00:56:54,608
If you hit a dog,

1271
00:56:54,610 --> 00:56:58,645
They fucking will put you
In jail for that shit.

1272
00:56:58,647 --> 00:57:00,047
You can't hit a person

1273
00:57:00,049 --> 00:57:03,483
Unless you can prove that
They were trying to kill you.

1274
00:57:03,485 --> 00:57:05,853
But a little, tiny person
With a head this big

1275
00:57:05,855 --> 00:57:07,755
Who trusts you implicitly,
Fuck 'em.

1276
00:57:07,757 --> 00:57:09,189
Who gives a shit?

1277
00:57:09,191 --> 00:57:12,326
Just fucking--
Let's all hit them.

1278
00:57:12,328 --> 00:57:14,562
People want you
To hit your kid.

1279
00:57:14,564 --> 00:57:16,263
If your kid's making noise,

1280
00:57:16,265 --> 00:57:17,464
They'll be like,
"Hit him! Hit him!

1281
00:57:17,466 --> 00:57:19,266
"Hit him!

1282
00:57:19,268 --> 00:57:23,603
[Growls]
Hit him!"

1283
00:57:23,605 --> 00:57:25,039
That's right.
We're proud of it.

1284
00:57:25,041 --> 00:57:26,740
We tell--
"I hit my kids."

1285
00:57:26,742 --> 00:57:28,175
That's what people say
All the time.

1286
00:57:28,177 --> 00:57:30,344
"You're damn right
I hit my kids."

1287
00:57:30,346 --> 00:57:32,179
"Why--why do you hit them?"

1288
00:57:32,181 --> 00:57:35,949
"'Cause they were doing a thing
I didn't like at the moment,

1289
00:57:35,951 --> 00:57:39,053
"And so i hit them,
And guess what?

1290
00:57:39,055 --> 00:57:42,122
They didn't do it after that."

1291
00:57:42,124 --> 00:57:44,124
Well, that wouldn't be taking
The fucking easy way out,

1292
00:57:44,126 --> 00:57:45,192
Would it?

1293
00:57:45,194 --> 00:57:46,827
How about talking to 'em
For a second,

1294
00:57:46,829 --> 00:57:49,930
You fucking retard?

1295
00:57:49,932 --> 00:57:51,732
How do you f--
How is that--

1296
00:57:51,734 --> 00:57:54,301
How is that the--

1297
00:57:54,303 --> 00:57:55,769
What are you, an idiot?

1298
00:57:55,771 --> 00:58:00,274
What are you?
A fucking ape?

1299
00:58:00,276 --> 00:58:02,276
"Well, i don't--
It's a pain in the ass."

1300
00:58:02,278 --> 00:58:03,477
Well, you fucked a woman,

1301
00:58:03,479 --> 00:58:05,379
And a fucking baby
Came out of her vagina.

1302
00:58:05,381 --> 00:58:08,081
Now you be patient.

1303
00:58:08,083 --> 00:58:12,219
It's not their fault.

1304
00:58:12,221 --> 00:58:14,822
"Well, i'm teaching 'em
That you hit things."

1305
00:58:18,025 --> 00:58:19,093
"It's learning the world.

1306
00:58:19,095 --> 00:58:22,529
"You hit him,
And he'll know...

1307
00:58:22,531 --> 00:58:25,265
"That i'm stronger than him,

1308
00:58:25,267 --> 00:58:27,968
"That it hurts when my hand
Hits his face.

1309
00:58:27,970 --> 00:58:29,102
"He'll know.

1310
00:58:29,104 --> 00:58:31,137
"He'll get some wisdom
Out of that.

1311
00:58:31,139 --> 00:58:33,941
Raising 'em right."

1312
00:58:33,943 --> 00:58:36,577
God damn it.

1313
00:58:36,579 --> 00:58:37,745
Look, though,
Let me say this.

1314
00:58:37,747 --> 00:58:40,180
If you have kids
And you do hit your kids,

1315
00:58:40,182 --> 00:58:42,015
I totally get it.
I'm not judging.

1316
00:58:42,017 --> 00:58:45,285
Let me just explain.
I get it.

1317
00:58:45,287 --> 00:58:48,488
Because my mom hit me.

1318
00:58:48,490 --> 00:58:50,424
She hit me all the time.

1319
00:58:50,426 --> 00:58:51,926
I don't hit my kids.

1320
00:58:51,928 --> 00:58:53,226
I'm not better than my mom.

1321
00:58:53,228 --> 00:58:55,228
It's 'cause she was poor
And i have money.

1322
00:58:55,230 --> 00:58:56,663
That's really all it is.

1323
00:58:56,665 --> 00:58:58,599
It really is.

1324
00:58:58,601 --> 00:59:00,000
My mom works really hard.

1325
00:59:00,002 --> 00:59:01,301
She was a single mom.

1326
00:59:01,303 --> 00:59:03,637
She'd come home all
Bent over after 15 hours.

1327
00:59:03,639 --> 00:59:05,739
I'd be like, "mommy,
Nyah nyah nyah."

1328
00:59:05,741 --> 00:59:06,907
"Shut up!"

1329
00:59:06,909 --> 00:59:09,409
I totally get that.

1330
00:59:09,411 --> 00:59:13,046
I work two hours a week
Sometimes,

1331
00:59:13,048 --> 00:59:15,816
So it's not really fair,

1332
00:59:15,818 --> 00:59:18,819
And i know that.

1333
00:59:18,821 --> 00:59:21,021
I know there's moments
When you just fucking--

1334
00:59:21,023 --> 00:59:22,890
I mean, they're--
Being a parent means you have

1335
00:59:22,892 --> 00:59:24,491
Your back up against the wall
All the time,

1336
00:59:24,493 --> 00:59:25,993
Because it's the only job
You can't quit.

1337
00:59:25,995 --> 00:59:27,561
It's the only job
Where you can't just go--

1338
00:59:27,563 --> 00:59:28,862
Just put your wrench
Down and go,

1339
00:59:28,864 --> 00:59:30,631
"Fuck it, guys.
I'm leaving.

1340
00:59:30,633 --> 00:59:32,933
"I don't even
Want my last check.

1341
00:59:32,935 --> 00:59:34,702
I'm going home."

1342
00:59:38,540 --> 00:59:40,307
Anyway, i got two.

1343
00:59:40,309 --> 00:59:42,610
And the seven-year-old,
She's no trouble now.

1344
00:59:42,612 --> 00:59:44,711
That kid's amazing.
She's better than me.

1345
00:59:44,713 --> 00:59:47,714
She's smarter than me.
She's more decent.

1346
00:59:47,716 --> 00:59:49,883
She's cleaner.

1347
00:59:49,885 --> 00:59:51,485
Like, she comes out
of her room all dressed

1348
00:59:51,487 --> 00:59:52,586
With a little bow.

1349
00:59:52,588 --> 00:59:54,154
She's like, "hi.
Good morning, daddy."

1350
00:59:54,156 --> 00:59:56,656
And i'm in my underwear,
Like, "uh, hi."

1351
01:00:03,198 --> 01:00:04,931
I keep trying
Not to screw her up,

1352
01:00:04,933 --> 01:00:06,400
Because she's headed
For a great life

1353
01:00:06,402 --> 01:00:07,468
Unless i fuck it up.

1354
01:00:07,470 --> 01:00:08,768
That's basically
What's going on.

1355
01:00:08,770 --> 01:00:10,070
I'm not--i'm not
A father anymore.

1356
01:00:10,072 --> 01:00:12,339
I'm just a fat landlord.
I don't really matter.

1357
01:00:15,543 --> 01:00:17,478
Like, the other day, she was
Asking me all these questions.

1358
01:00:17,480 --> 01:00:19,146
And i totally hear--
She's asking me stuff,

1359
01:00:19,148 --> 01:00:21,081
And i'm just trying to tell her
What i know to be the truth.

1360
01:00:21,083 --> 01:00:22,216
But you can't just do that.

1361
01:00:22,218 --> 01:00:23,317
There's some shit
That's true

1362
01:00:23,319 --> 01:00:24,385
That you can't tell your kids

1363
01:00:24,387 --> 01:00:25,452
When they're certain ages.

1364
01:00:25,454 --> 01:00:26,820
I know that sounds simple,

1365
01:00:26,822 --> 01:00:29,356
But you don't know all the time
Until you fuck up.

1366
01:00:29,358 --> 01:00:30,690
I'm talking to her,
And she goes,

1367
01:00:30,692 --> 01:00:32,326
"Daddy, does the earth
Go around the sun?"

1368
01:00:32,328 --> 01:00:33,427
And i was like, "yeah."

1369
01:00:33,429 --> 01:00:34,895
She goes, "does it do it
All the time?"

1370
01:00:34,897 --> 01:00:36,296
And i go, "yeah."

1371
01:00:36,298 --> 01:00:39,066
She says, "will the earth always
Go around the sun forever?"

1372
01:00:39,068 --> 01:00:40,734
And i was like,
"Well, no, at some point,

1373
01:00:40,736 --> 01:00:43,337
The sun's gonna explode."

1374
01:00:49,077 --> 01:00:52,012
She's seven years old.

1375
01:00:52,014 --> 01:00:53,580
Do you understand
How horrible that is?

1376
01:00:53,582 --> 01:00:55,382
She started crying
Immediately.

1377
01:00:55,384 --> 01:00:59,386
Crying bitter tears
For the death of all humanity.

1378
01:00:59,388 --> 01:01:01,021
And here's how
I tried to save it.

1379
01:01:01,023 --> 01:01:02,756
I go, "oh, honey,
This isn't gonna happen

1380
01:01:02,758 --> 01:01:04,091
"Until you
And everybody you know

1381
01:01:04,093 --> 01:01:06,026
Has been dead
For a very long time."

1382
01:01:10,398 --> 01:01:13,133
She didn't know
Any of those things,

1383
01:01:13,135 --> 01:01:16,937
And now she knows
All of those things.

1384
01:01:16,939 --> 01:01:19,339
She's gonna die.

1385
01:01:19,341 --> 01:01:22,209
Everybody she knows
Is gonna die.

1386
01:01:22,211 --> 01:01:25,145
They're gonna be dead
For a very long time,

1387
01:01:25,147 --> 01:01:28,515
And then the sun's
gonna explode.

1388
01:01:28,517 --> 01:01:33,387
She learned all that
In 12 seconds

1389
01:01:33,389 --> 01:01:36,856
At the age of seven.

1390
01:01:36,858 --> 01:01:38,625
She took it pretty well.
I was proud of her.

1391
01:01:38,627 --> 01:01:43,464
She's like, "oh. Dude."

1392
01:01:43,466 --> 01:01:45,532
[Breathes heavily]

1393
01:01:45,534 --> 01:01:48,468
"Okay, well...

1394
01:01:48,470 --> 01:01:51,705
I guess i'll go play.
I don't..."

1395
01:01:54,075 --> 01:01:55,341
She's had a tough year,
That kid.

1396
01:01:55,343 --> 01:01:56,577
I feel really bad.

1397
01:01:56,579 --> 01:01:58,278
Lot of bad things
Happened to her this year.

1398
01:01:58,280 --> 01:02:00,547
This summer,
She got bit by a pony.

1399
01:02:00,549 --> 01:02:01,982
I'm not kidding.

1400
01:02:01,984 --> 01:02:04,551
A pony bit her.

1401
01:02:04,553 --> 01:02:08,822
How do you more break
A little girl's heart?

1402
01:02:08,824 --> 01:02:10,023
Than a pony bi--

1403
01:02:10,025 --> 01:02:12,659
That's like being raped
By Santa Claus.

1404
01:02:16,431 --> 01:02:19,933
It was the worst thing
That ever happened,

1405
01:02:19,935 --> 01:02:21,568
And it was made worse
By the fact

1406
01:02:21,570 --> 01:02:24,138
That it followed the greatest
Moment of her life,

1407
01:02:24,140 --> 01:02:26,173
Because she'd never
Seen a pony up close.

1408
01:02:26,175 --> 01:02:28,008
We just never were fucking--
Shitty parents.

1409
01:02:28,010 --> 01:02:29,909
We never gave her,
Like, a pony ride.

1410
01:02:29,911 --> 01:02:31,645
And last summer
I took the kids to Italy.

1411
01:02:31,647 --> 01:02:33,413
I took my girls to Italy
For whatever reason.

1412
01:02:33,415 --> 01:02:34,848
I don't know why.

1413
01:02:34,850 --> 01:02:37,351
And we're in this farmhouse
In the middle of nowhere.

1414
01:02:37,353 --> 01:02:38,818
And i put 'em to bed,
And i come outside,

1415
01:02:38,820 --> 01:02:40,420
And there's ponies.

1416
01:02:40,422 --> 01:02:43,023
They just showed up
Out of nowhere.

1417
01:02:43,025 --> 01:02:45,159
Just wild ponies.

1418
01:02:45,161 --> 01:02:48,262
Like 50 ponies.
I'm not fucking with you.

1419
01:02:48,264 --> 01:02:50,664
A huge amount of ponies.
And one donkey.

1420
01:02:50,666 --> 01:02:51,931
I don't know why.

1421
01:02:51,933 --> 01:02:56,236
There was one donkey
Hanging out with the ponies.

1422
01:02:56,238 --> 01:02:57,271
And they're just la--

1423
01:02:57,273 --> 01:02:58,405
And i'm like--
[Gasps]

1424
01:02:58,407 --> 01:02:59,939
And i run downstairs,
And i wake her up.

1425
01:02:59,941 --> 01:03:01,041
The little one, fuck her.

1426
01:03:01,043 --> 01:03:02,108
She's not making memories.

1427
01:03:02,110 --> 01:03:03,277
Who cares?
It's not worth it.

1428
01:03:03,279 --> 01:03:04,978
I take the seven-year-old,

1429
01:03:04,980 --> 01:03:07,247
And i bring her outside,

1430
01:03:07,249 --> 01:03:10,317
And she's standing barefoot
In her pajamas.

1431
01:03:10,319 --> 01:03:12,886
And it's dusk,
And it's ponies,

1432
01:03:12,888 --> 01:03:14,421
And she's like--
[Gasps]

1433
01:03:14,423 --> 01:03:16,256
And i'm like,
"I'm the best fucking father.

1434
01:03:16,258 --> 01:03:18,892
"I'm the best father.
Yeah!

1435
01:03:18,894 --> 01:03:22,929
"Yeah!
Look at that shit!

1436
01:03:22,931 --> 01:03:28,368
That's right!
I gave that to you!"

1437
01:03:28,370 --> 01:03:31,471
And she starts walking out
Towards the ponies.

1438
01:03:31,473 --> 01:03:32,806
She's like,
"Can i go near them?

1439
01:03:32,808 --> 01:03:34,307
I'm like, "yeah."
I'm an idiot.

1440
01:03:34,309 --> 01:03:36,176
I'm like, "yeah, totally.

1441
01:03:36,178 --> 01:03:37,878
"Go on out there, honey.

1442
01:03:37,880 --> 01:03:41,514
"You're only outnumbered
50 to 1.

1443
01:03:41,516 --> 01:03:43,950
"What could possibly happen

1444
01:03:43,952 --> 01:03:46,820
In a sea of wild ponies?"

1445
01:03:48,422 --> 01:03:49,823
And she walks out,

1446
01:03:49,825 --> 01:03:52,025
And there's this one,
Beautiful, speckled pony,

1447
01:03:52,027 --> 01:03:53,359
And as she's
Walking towards it,

1448
01:03:53,361 --> 01:03:54,961
I'm an asshole,
'Cause i don't read--

1449
01:03:54,963 --> 01:03:58,331
It's going like--
[Snorts]

1450
01:03:58,333 --> 01:04:00,233
It's totally going,
"Dude, [snorts] no.

1451
01:04:00,235 --> 01:04:02,435
"Not--i'm not one of--
Fuck it.

1452
01:04:02,437 --> 01:04:03,837
"Get her out. Get her out.

1453
01:04:03,839 --> 01:04:06,006
"I'm a--dude,
I'm a fucking Italian wild pony.

1454
01:04:06,008 --> 01:04:09,242
Get her out of here."

1455
01:04:09,244 --> 01:04:10,844
Can i go, daddy?

1456
01:04:10,846 --> 01:04:13,613
I'm like, "yes, totally.
Go up to the pony."

1457
01:04:13,615 --> 01:04:14,981
She walks up to the pony,

1458
01:04:14,983 --> 01:04:17,050
And she turns to me and says,
"He's beautiful."

1459
01:04:17,052 --> 01:04:18,318
And as she's saying that,

1460
01:04:18,320 --> 01:04:21,622
The pony bites her
On the fucking leg.

1461
01:04:21,624 --> 01:04:23,056
And she screams.

1462
01:04:23,058 --> 01:04:25,191
It didn't break the skin,
But it was an awful bruise.

1463
01:04:25,193 --> 01:04:26,793
And i grab her
And i run inside.

1464
01:04:26,795 --> 01:04:30,530
And she says, "why, daddy?
Why did the pony bite me?"

1465
01:04:30,532 --> 01:04:32,699
And i said, "i don't know."

1466
01:04:32,701 --> 01:04:34,902
And she said,
"Do ponies bite a lot?"

1467
01:04:34,904 --> 01:04:36,035
And i'm like, "well, yeah,"

1468
01:04:36,037 --> 01:04:37,337
'Cause i don't want her to think

1469
01:04:37,339 --> 01:04:38,104
That she's so horrible

1470
01:04:38,106 --> 01:04:40,874
That the first pony ever
Bit her.

1471
01:04:40,876 --> 01:04:42,776
I go, "yeah, honey,
Ponies bite,"

1472
01:04:42,778 --> 01:04:45,478
And she goes, "well,
Why did you let me near it?"

1473
01:04:49,116 --> 01:04:52,185
She's like, "dude,
Make a fucking effort."

1474
01:04:58,026 --> 01:04:59,892
And then we're in the house,
And she says--

1475
01:04:59,894 --> 01:05:01,394
This is how great this kid is.

1476
01:05:01,396 --> 01:05:02,829
She calms down,
And she goes,

1477
01:05:02,831 --> 01:05:05,065
"I want to look up
About ponies biting."

1478
01:05:05,067 --> 01:05:06,166
Like, that's how she thinks.

1479
01:05:06,168 --> 01:05:07,301
Something upsets her,

1480
01:05:07,303 --> 01:05:10,104
She wants to look it up
And learn about it.

1481
01:05:10,106 --> 01:05:11,471
She says, "i want to find out
Why they bite

1482
01:05:11,473 --> 01:05:13,373
And what people say about it."

1483
01:05:13,375 --> 01:05:16,042
So we go and we do look up
About ponies,

1484
01:05:16,044 --> 01:05:17,578
And it turns
Out they're assholes.

1485
01:05:17,580 --> 01:05:21,748
They bite all the time.

1486
01:05:21,750 --> 01:05:23,083
And there's all these websites

1487
01:05:23,085 --> 01:05:25,418
That talk about what to do
When your pony bites,

1488
01:05:25,420 --> 01:05:27,254
And it's like everything else
On the internet.

1489
01:05:27,256 --> 01:05:29,923
It's just fighting.
Just people angry at each other.

1490
01:05:29,925 --> 01:05:31,191
The first guy says,

1491
01:05:31,193 --> 01:05:34,994
"You got to punch the pony
Right in the face."

1492
01:05:34,996 --> 01:05:37,397
Just punch it
Right in the face.

1493
01:05:39,567 --> 01:05:42,302
Then the next person says,
"You're a terrible person.

1494
01:05:42,304 --> 01:05:46,340
You should have your ponies
Taken away from you."

1495
01:05:46,342 --> 01:05:47,974
The next person
Was my favorite.

1496
01:05:47,976 --> 01:05:50,977
They go, "people who don't punch
Their ponies make me sick."

1497
01:05:55,016 --> 01:05:57,584
So we really are
A divided nation.

1498
01:06:01,790 --> 01:06:04,057
The three-year-old
Is a different story.

1499
01:06:04,059 --> 01:06:05,726
The three-year-old,
Here's her deal.

1500
01:06:05,728 --> 01:06:07,794
She's a three-year-old.
That's really it.

1501
01:06:07,796 --> 01:06:08,928
She's three years old.

1502
01:06:08,930 --> 01:06:10,397
The other day
I got in a fight with her.

1503
01:06:10,399 --> 01:06:12,132
Whose fault is that?

1504
01:06:12,134 --> 01:06:15,135
I'm 41,
And she's 3.

1505
01:06:15,137 --> 01:06:16,970
It's always your fault
With a three-year-old.

1506
01:06:16,972 --> 01:06:17,971
Always.

1507
01:06:17,973 --> 01:06:19,206
Because they are
Just what they are.

1508
01:06:19,208 --> 01:06:21,208
They can't help it.
Just tape the windows.

1509
01:06:21,210 --> 01:06:24,378
It's a fucking hurricane.
Just wait.

1510
01:06:24,380 --> 01:06:26,380
Anytime you're like this
With a three-year-old--

1511
01:06:26,382 --> 01:06:28,348
"Don't you under--"
You're an idiot.

1512
01:06:28,350 --> 01:06:29,349
That's you being an idiot.

1513
01:06:29,351 --> 01:06:30,717
"Don't you understand?"

1514
01:06:30,719 --> 01:06:32,553
"No, i don't, dad.
I haven't developed enough.

1515
01:06:32,555 --> 01:06:36,356
You just have to wait."

1516
01:06:36,358 --> 01:06:37,424
But it was partly her fault,

1517
01:06:37,426 --> 01:06:38,892
'Cause she wore me down.

1518
01:06:38,894 --> 01:06:40,060
Let me tell you
What happened.

1519
01:06:40,062 --> 01:06:41,562
It was this horrible,
Horrible day.

1520
01:06:41,564 --> 01:06:43,664
It started the night before,
'Cause she woke me up all night.

1521
01:06:43,666 --> 01:06:44,798
Just woke me up
Every fucking--

1522
01:06:44,800 --> 01:06:46,066
Just ten minutes.
Just woke me up--

1523
01:06:46,068 --> 01:06:47,233
Just--
"Dad."

1524
01:06:47,235 --> 01:06:48,735
With nothing.
That's the worst part.

1525
01:06:48,737 --> 01:06:50,204
"Daddy!"
"Wha--what? What is it?"

1526
01:06:50,206 --> 01:06:51,205
"Um..."

1527
01:06:51,207 --> 01:06:53,940
"Oh, fuck you.
You got nothing.

1528
01:06:53,942 --> 01:06:56,176
You bullshitter, you."

1529
01:06:59,214 --> 01:07:00,914
So now it's the next morning,

1530
01:07:00,916 --> 01:07:02,749
I'm making breakfast,
And i'm gone.

1531
01:07:02,751 --> 01:07:04,484
I'm insane.

1532
01:07:04,486 --> 01:07:06,119
I drank too much coffee
To overcompensate,

1533
01:07:06,121 --> 01:07:07,421
And i'm like--

1534
01:07:07,423 --> 01:07:09,223
I keep having these moments
Where it's like--

1535
01:07:09,225 --> 01:07:12,058
And there's nothing there.
Just nothing.

1536
01:07:12,060 --> 01:07:14,695
"Uh, okay. Jesus."

1537
01:07:14,697 --> 01:07:15,895
I'm making french toast.

1538
01:07:15,897 --> 01:07:17,664
She's over there
Sitting in her little chair,

1539
01:07:17,666 --> 01:07:18,732
Just fucking anger.

1540
01:07:18,734 --> 01:07:20,534
Just pure--she's
A little ball of anger.

1541
01:07:20,536 --> 01:07:24,170
She's like,
"I want french toast!"

1542
01:07:24,172 --> 01:07:26,740
I'm like, "yeah, that's
What i'm making, honey.

1543
01:07:26,742 --> 01:07:28,408
I'm making french toast."

1544
01:07:28,410 --> 01:07:30,110
I bring it over.
"Here."

1545
01:07:30,112 --> 01:07:32,312
"Give me syrup!"

1546
01:07:32,314 --> 01:07:34,781
"Yes. of course.
I'll give you syrup.

1547
01:07:34,783 --> 01:07:37,517
I always do.
I love you very much."

1548
01:07:37,519 --> 01:07:39,919
"Cut it for me!"

1549
01:07:39,921 --> 01:07:41,388
"I'm happy to cut it for you.

1550
01:07:41,390 --> 01:07:43,590
"You're not asking nicely,
But it's okay.

1551
01:07:43,592 --> 01:07:44,658
"I'll cut it for you,
Baby.

1552
01:07:44,660 --> 01:07:46,860
I love you very much."

1553
01:07:46,862 --> 01:07:48,595
Then she's looking
At her plate,

1554
01:07:48,597 --> 01:07:51,030
And she's literally going--
[Breathing heavily]

1555
01:07:51,032 --> 01:07:52,899
'Cause she needs to be--
Want something.

1556
01:07:52,901 --> 01:07:53,967
You know, she didn't--

1557
01:07:53,969 --> 01:07:55,535
There's nothing logical
For her to want,

1558
01:07:55,537 --> 01:07:57,738
So her brain has to go
Somewhere crazy.

1559
01:07:57,740 --> 01:07:58,938
So she's looking
At her plate.

1560
01:07:58,940 --> 01:08:03,242
She goes, "i don't know
Which piece to eat!"

1561
01:08:07,581 --> 01:08:09,015
And i'm still not engaging.

1562
01:08:09,017 --> 01:08:10,216
I'm like,
"Oh, i know, honey.

1563
01:08:10,218 --> 01:08:12,151
"That's hard.
That's really hard.

1564
01:08:12,153 --> 01:08:14,320
"I'll just make a list of pros
And cons for every piece,

1565
01:08:14,322 --> 01:08:16,455
And i'll help you
With it later."

1566
01:08:16,457 --> 01:08:18,391
And i look at her,
And she's walking towards me now

1567
01:08:18,393 --> 01:08:19,826
With the plate just vertical,

1568
01:08:19,828 --> 01:08:21,728
With syrup fucking
Going on the floor.

1569
01:08:21,730 --> 01:08:24,731
She's like,
"Help me!

1570
01:08:24,733 --> 01:08:27,634
You're not helping!"

1571
01:08:29,637 --> 01:08:33,973
And i'm standing there,
Like, looking at her,

1572
01:08:33,975 --> 01:08:38,044
And i love her,
And i'm proud of her in a way,

1573
01:08:38,046 --> 01:08:39,713
'Cause i know she'll never
Want for anything.

1574
01:08:39,715 --> 01:08:41,214
She'll beat the shit
Out of people.

1575
01:08:41,216 --> 01:08:43,850
She's...

1576
01:08:43,852 --> 01:08:46,519
She'll kill people for meat
After the apocalypse.

1577
01:08:46,521 --> 01:08:50,757
She'll be one of those.

1578
01:08:50,759 --> 01:08:52,926
And then later i'm trying
To get them dressed for school,

1579
01:08:52,928 --> 01:08:54,928
And now the clock's ticking,
And i'm like, "uh..."

1580
01:08:54,930 --> 01:08:56,330
And i'm trying to put
A sweater on her,

1581
01:08:56,332 --> 01:08:57,564
And it's impossible.

1582
01:08:57,566 --> 01:08:59,666
The sweater has buttons
That just don't exist.

1583
01:08:59,668 --> 01:09:00,867
And i'm fucking--

1584
01:09:00,869 --> 01:09:03,102
My fat fingers,
And they're full of sweat.

1585
01:09:03,104 --> 01:09:05,338
And i have just tears
Going down my cheeks.

1586
01:09:05,340 --> 01:09:06,973
Crazy tears.

1587
01:09:06,975 --> 01:09:08,041
I'm not crying.

1588
01:09:08,043 --> 01:09:10,010
I'm, like,
Smiling with tears.

1589
01:09:10,012 --> 01:09:11,544
Copious--

1590
01:09:11,546 --> 01:09:13,480
"I can't--
I can't put on the sweater.

1591
01:09:13,482 --> 01:09:16,516
"I can't put on the sweater.

1592
01:09:16,518 --> 01:09:19,852
I can't.
I really can't do it."

1593
01:09:19,854 --> 01:09:22,922
And she's going like this.

1594
01:09:22,924 --> 01:09:25,358
So i give her a fig newton
Just to immobilize her,

1595
01:09:25,360 --> 01:09:27,059
Just to stop it.

1596
01:09:27,061 --> 01:09:29,096
'Cause she loves fig newtons.

1597
01:09:29,098 --> 01:09:30,530
I go, "here, honey.
Have a fig newton."

1598
01:09:30,532 --> 01:09:34,401
She goes, "they're not
Called fig newtons.

1599
01:09:34,403 --> 01:09:39,572
They're called pig newtons."

1600
01:09:39,574 --> 01:09:42,876
And i go,
"No, they're not.

1601
01:09:42,878 --> 01:09:46,413
They're called fig newtons."

1602
01:09:46,415 --> 01:09:49,482
And right away in my head
I'm like, "what are you doing?

1603
01:09:49,484 --> 01:09:53,453
"Why?
What is to be gained?

1604
01:09:53,455 --> 01:09:55,354
What do you care?"

1605
01:09:55,356 --> 01:09:57,624
Just--"yeah, pig newtons.
Fine. Go ahead.

1606
01:09:57,626 --> 01:09:59,025
"Good luck to you.
Go through life.

1607
01:09:59,027 --> 01:10:00,326
"See what kind of job
You can hold down

1608
01:10:00,328 --> 01:10:02,295
"With shit like that
Clanging around in your head.

1609
01:10:02,297 --> 01:10:05,865
I don't care.
I'll be dead."

1610
01:10:05,867 --> 01:10:07,767
But for some reason
I engaged.

1611
01:10:07,769 --> 01:10:10,637
"No, honey,
They're called fig newtons."

1612
01:10:10,639 --> 01:10:13,840
She goes,
"No. You don't know.

1613
01:10:13,842 --> 01:10:18,144
You don't know.
They're called pig newtons."

1614
01:10:18,146 --> 01:10:21,314
And i just--i feel this rage
Building inside.

1615
01:10:21,316 --> 01:10:24,116
Just...

1616
01:10:24,118 --> 01:10:26,352
Because it's not
That she's wrong.

1617
01:10:26,354 --> 01:10:28,387
She's three.
She's entitled to be wrong.

1618
01:10:28,389 --> 01:10:31,591
But it's the fucking arrogance

1619
01:10:31,593 --> 01:10:33,827
of this kid.

1620
01:10:33,829 --> 01:10:36,262
No humility.

1621
01:10:36,264 --> 01:10:39,298
No decent sense
of self-doubt.

1622
01:10:39,300 --> 01:10:41,568
She's not going like, "dad,
I think those are pig newtons.

1623
01:10:41,570 --> 01:10:43,336
Are you sure
That you have it right?"

1624
01:10:43,338 --> 01:10:44,370
She's not saying that.

1625
01:10:44,372 --> 01:10:45,638
She's not going, like,

1626
01:10:45,640 --> 01:10:47,440
"Dad, i'm pretty sure
Those are pig newtons,"

1627
01:10:47,442 --> 01:10:49,175
Which would be a little
Cunty, but acceptable.

1628
01:10:49,177 --> 01:10:50,544
I could deal with that.

1629
01:10:50,546 --> 01:10:52,412
She's giving me nothing.

1630
01:10:52,414 --> 01:10:55,248
"No, you don't know.

1631
01:10:55,250 --> 01:10:56,583
Those are pig--"

1632
01:10:56,585 --> 01:10:58,217
I'm like,
"Really? I don't know?

1633
01:10:58,219 --> 01:10:59,719
"I don't know?

1634
01:10:59,721 --> 01:11:02,889
"Dude, i'm not even using
My memory right now, okay?

1635
01:11:02,891 --> 01:11:05,525
"I'm reading the fucking box

1636
01:11:05,527 --> 01:11:09,162
"That the shit came out of!

1637
01:11:09,164 --> 01:11:12,064
"It says it!

1638
01:11:12,066 --> 01:11:14,901
Where are you getting
Your information?"

1639
01:11:16,370 --> 01:11:20,339
"How do you fuck with me
On this?

1640
01:11:20,341 --> 01:11:24,811
"You're 3 and i'm 41!

1641
01:11:24,813 --> 01:11:28,247
"What are the odds that
You're right and i'm wrong?

1642
01:11:28,249 --> 01:11:31,150
"What are the sheer odds
of that?

1643
01:11:31,152 --> 01:11:32,819
"And take a bite
of the cookie.

1644
01:11:32,821 --> 01:11:34,754
"Does it taste like
A pork cookie, motherfucker?

1645
01:11:34,756 --> 01:11:38,624
"I don't think so.

1646
01:11:38,626 --> 01:11:41,227
Why would they call it
A pig newton?"

1647
01:11:44,765 --> 01:11:46,566
"What's--
Oh, it tastes like figs.

1648
01:11:46,568 --> 01:11:48,801
Fucking interesting,
That, isn't it?"

1649
01:11:55,843 --> 01:11:57,510
I didn't say a word of that.
Obviously.

1650
01:11:57,512 --> 01:11:59,880
But anyway, later...

1651
01:11:59,882 --> 01:12:02,349
Got the kids dressed.
It's winter.

1652
01:12:02,351 --> 01:12:03,449
We all have the layers on,

1653
01:12:03,451 --> 01:12:04,617
And it's time
To go to school.

1654
01:12:04,619 --> 01:12:06,519
And i've got ten minutes
To get to a school

1655
01:12:06,521 --> 01:12:07,520
That's ten minutes away,

1656
01:12:07,522 --> 01:12:09,122
Which is a horrible feeling.

1657
01:12:09,124 --> 01:12:10,957
I put my hand
On the door to leave,

1658
01:12:10,959 --> 01:12:15,895
And all of a sudden i go,
"I got to take a shit.

1659
01:12:15,897 --> 01:12:16,896
"Take the coats off, kids.

1660
01:12:16,898 --> 01:12:18,064
"We're gonna be late.

1661
01:12:18,066 --> 01:12:19,532
"You're gonna be
40 minutes late.

1662
01:12:19,534 --> 01:12:20,800
I don't give a shit."

1663
01:12:20,802 --> 01:12:23,637
I am not walking
To school like this.

1664
01:12:23,639 --> 01:12:25,638
I can't use the bathroom
At the school,

1665
01:12:25,640 --> 01:12:29,408
'Cause child molesters
Ruined that for everybody.

1666
01:12:29,410 --> 01:12:31,878
Just--we're--
I'm shitting here.

1667
01:12:31,880 --> 01:12:33,179
So i'm sitting on the toilet.

1668
01:12:33,181 --> 01:12:34,213
I'm shitting.

1669
01:12:34,215 --> 01:12:35,381
With the door open,
By the way.

1670
01:12:35,383 --> 01:12:37,717
That's my life.
Two kids by myself.

1671
01:12:37,719 --> 01:12:39,653
I can't shit
With the door closed.

1672
01:12:39,655 --> 01:12:41,354
Unless i gather them
Into the bathroom

1673
01:12:41,356 --> 01:12:43,056
To watch daddy take a dump.

1674
01:12:43,058 --> 01:12:44,857
Which i've done
With the little one.

1675
01:12:44,859 --> 01:12:47,159
"Honey, uh, i got to poop
And you're too crazy.

1676
01:12:47,161 --> 01:12:50,830
Just come with me.
You got to come with me."

1677
01:12:50,832 --> 01:12:52,932
So i'm sitting there,
And i'm shitting,

1678
01:12:52,934 --> 01:12:57,137
And i'm trying to see them
In the other room.

1679
01:12:57,139 --> 01:12:58,404
"Honey,
Stay between the tables.

1680
01:12:58,406 --> 01:13:00,807
I can't see you,"
I said.

1681
01:13:00,809 --> 01:13:03,910
The little one
Walks into view naked.

1682
01:13:03,912 --> 01:13:08,514
It's all gone.
All gone.

1683
01:13:08,516 --> 01:13:10,283
Walks up, looks at me.

1684
01:13:19,660 --> 01:13:20,927
And then she--

1685
01:13:20,929 --> 01:13:22,528
I don't know why,
But she shows me her ass.

1686
01:13:22,530 --> 01:13:24,297
It's something
She always does when she's--

1687
01:13:24,299 --> 01:13:26,399
She just goes--

1688
01:13:30,371 --> 01:13:32,104
"Look at it!

1689
01:13:32,106 --> 01:13:34,640
Daddy,
You're not looking!"

1690
01:13:38,412 --> 01:13:42,682
So i'm sitting there shitting,
Looking at her ass.

1691
01:13:42,684 --> 01:13:45,518
[Clears throat]

1692
01:13:45,520 --> 01:13:49,121
And i saw something
That i'd never seen before.

1693
01:13:49,123 --> 01:13:51,157
And i'm gonna describe it to you
The way that i saw it,

1694
01:13:51,159 --> 01:13:53,125
Because it just--i didn't know
What i was looking at.

1695
01:13:53,127 --> 01:13:54,461
I'm looking at her little,
White ass.

1696
01:13:54,463 --> 01:13:57,964
She's white. Little, perfect,
Little, white ass.

1697
01:13:57,966 --> 01:13:59,632
And right in the center of it,

1698
01:13:59,634 --> 01:14:01,467
This little black dot
Just--boop!

1699
01:14:01,469 --> 01:14:03,436
Appeared like magic.

1700
01:14:03,438 --> 01:14:04,904
That's what it
Looked like to me,

1701
01:14:04,906 --> 01:14:06,071
Because i've never
Seen shit

1702
01:14:06,073 --> 01:14:08,541
Actually coming out
of an ass before.

1703
01:14:08,543 --> 01:14:11,311
I never saw that.

1704
01:14:11,313 --> 01:14:12,445
I never saw the shit--

1705
01:14:12,447 --> 01:14:16,048
Like, the crowning,
The shit coming out.

1706
01:14:16,050 --> 01:14:18,050
And if you ever do see that,

1707
01:14:18,052 --> 01:14:19,519
It's fucking bananas, man.

1708
01:14:19,521 --> 01:14:21,654
It's weird.

1709
01:14:21,656 --> 01:14:23,155
And upsetting.

1710
01:14:23,157 --> 01:14:26,492
I yelled.
I went, "aah!"

1711
01:14:29,596 --> 01:14:31,964
And a second later, just--

1712
01:14:31,966 --> 01:14:35,435
She just drops
This massive--

1713
01:14:35,437 --> 01:14:38,304
I felt the impact tremor
Under my feet.

1714
01:14:38,306 --> 01:14:42,675
This huge pile of shit.

1715
01:14:42,677 --> 01:14:44,210
Just a pile.

1716
01:14:44,212 --> 01:14:47,313
Like several people's
Pile of shit.

1717
01:14:47,315 --> 01:14:49,915
Like a port-a-potty on
The last day of the festival.

1718
01:14:49,917 --> 01:14:54,420
Just a huge,
Huge pile of shit.

1719
01:14:54,422 --> 01:14:56,856
How? She's three.

1720
01:14:56,858 --> 01:14:58,658
This kid shits like a bear.

1721
01:14:58,660 --> 01:15:02,128
I don't understand it.
Seriously.

1722
01:15:02,130 --> 01:15:04,464
If you were in the woods
And you saw a shit like that,

1723
01:15:04,466 --> 01:15:06,899
You'd be like, "let's get
The fuck out of here!

1724
01:15:06,901 --> 01:15:08,935
Run!"

1725
01:15:08,937 --> 01:15:10,803
Huge pile of shit.

1726
01:15:10,805 --> 01:15:13,106
As big as her whole body.
Easily.

1727
01:15:13,108 --> 01:15:17,143
I thought she would just crumple
Like a balloon on top of it.

1728
01:15:17,145 --> 01:15:20,747
"Huh. Weird."

1729
01:15:20,749 --> 01:15:23,549
She's standing there just
Straddling this huge shit,

1730
01:15:23,551 --> 01:15:26,085
Presenting it, like...

1731
01:15:32,659 --> 01:15:35,861
She slips, falls
Right into her own shit.

1732
01:15:35,863 --> 01:15:37,697
Yes, fell--
I was there.

1733
01:15:37,699 --> 01:15:39,131
Fell right in the middle

1734
01:15:39,133 --> 01:15:44,237
of her own heap of shit.

1735
01:15:44,239 --> 01:15:45,872
Her head hit the floor.

1736
01:15:45,874 --> 01:15:48,040
You know that sound of your
Kid's head hitting the floor?

1737
01:15:48,042 --> 01:15:51,644
[Smacks stool]
"Ooh. Oh, God.

1738
01:15:51,646 --> 01:15:53,146
"Uh, she's done.

1739
01:15:53,148 --> 01:15:56,049
"That's it for her.
She's finished.

1740
01:15:56,051 --> 01:15:58,317
"She's gonna be running
To the mailbox once a day.

1741
01:15:58,319 --> 01:16:00,219
That's about it for her."

1742
01:16:04,658 --> 01:16:06,393
Now she's laying
In her shit,

1743
01:16:06,395 --> 01:16:11,030
Screaming and crying
And making an angel.

1744
01:16:14,368 --> 01:16:16,669
I run over.
I'm still shitting,

1745
01:16:16,671 --> 01:16:19,038
Holding a
Shit-covered child.

1746
01:16:19,040 --> 01:16:20,473
We're the shit family.

1747
01:16:20,475 --> 01:16:21,975
That's what we are.

1748
01:16:21,977 --> 01:16:23,509
The seven-year-old's
Standing there,

1749
01:16:23,511 --> 01:16:24,978
"I got to get
The fuck out of here.

1750
01:16:24,980 --> 01:16:26,445
This is horrible."

1751
01:16:32,086 --> 01:16:33,920
That's my life right now,
Man.

1752
01:16:33,922 --> 01:16:37,590
That's--like, where in there
Do i fit, like,

1753
01:16:37,592 --> 01:16:39,025
Getting pussy?

1754
01:16:39,027 --> 01:16:40,793
Like, there's no place
For that.

1755
01:16:40,795 --> 01:16:44,096
I can't even think about it.

1756
01:16:44,098 --> 01:16:45,331
I tried to, like--

1757
01:16:45,333 --> 01:16:46,232
The other day i was, like,

1758
01:16:46,234 --> 01:16:48,067
Okay, take a sexual
Inventory here.

1759
01:16:48,069 --> 01:16:49,902
What do you got left,
You know?

1760
01:16:49,904 --> 01:16:51,236
And i went--
I took off my clothes,

1761
01:16:51,238 --> 01:16:52,438
And i stood in the mirror,

1762
01:16:52,440 --> 01:16:53,473
And i looked in the mirror,

1763
01:16:53,475 --> 01:16:54,874
Like, a full-length mirror,
Naked.

1764
01:16:54,876 --> 01:16:56,109
I'll never do that again.

1765
01:16:56,111 --> 01:16:57,510
I don't need--
I don't need to do it.

1766
01:16:57,512 --> 01:16:59,045
I can go my whole life
Without doing it again.

1767
01:16:59,047 --> 01:17:00,179
I'm going to.

1768
01:17:00,181 --> 01:17:02,482
I'm not in good shape.

1769
01:17:02,484 --> 01:17:03,916
I'm not in the worst shape.

1770
01:17:03,918 --> 01:17:05,018
I mean,
I went to a doctor,

1771
01:17:05,020 --> 01:17:06,685
And he gave me the whole
41-year-old thing.

1772
01:17:06,687 --> 01:17:08,454
He's like, "all right, well,
Your cholesterol is high,

1773
01:17:08,456 --> 01:17:11,090
"But i don't expect you
To do anything about that.

1774
01:17:11,092 --> 01:17:13,259
"And your prostate's
A little bit too big.

1775
01:17:13,261 --> 01:17:16,029
"Let's go ahead and let it
Be a little too big.

1776
01:17:16,031 --> 01:17:18,931
And you're only
Cosmetically overweight."

1777
01:17:18,933 --> 01:17:20,366
I was like, "what?"

1778
01:17:20,368 --> 01:17:22,068
He goes,
"Your overweightness,

1779
01:17:22,070 --> 01:17:23,903
It's not a medical issue."

1780
01:17:23,905 --> 01:17:27,873
I'm like, "well, so then you
didn't have to say anything.

1781
01:17:27,875 --> 01:17:30,043
Why--why did you even
bring it up?"

1782
01:17:30,045 --> 01:17:31,844
You're just saying, like,
"Well, medically speaking,

1783
01:17:31,846 --> 01:17:34,380
You don't have a weight
problem, but you look gross."

1784
01:17:34,382 --> 01:17:36,315
That's what he's saying.

1785
01:17:38,218 --> 01:17:39,218
I'm looking at myself,

1786
01:17:39,220 --> 01:17:40,420
And here's the problem,

1787
01:17:40,422 --> 01:17:42,522
Is that i didn't even
wear down evenly.

1788
01:17:42,524 --> 01:17:44,657
Like, different parts
of my body

1789
01:17:44,659 --> 01:17:46,025
Are older than others.

1790
01:17:46,027 --> 01:17:49,295
Like, my dick and balls
Don't even match each other.

1791
01:17:49,297 --> 01:17:51,364
Like, my balls
Are older than me.

1792
01:17:51,366 --> 01:17:52,798
They're, like, the old--
I swear to God.

1793
01:17:52,800 --> 01:17:56,068
I'm 41.
My balls are, like, 72.

1794
01:17:56,070 --> 01:17:59,104
They're really old, and they
Just kind of hang there.

1795
01:18:04,344 --> 01:18:05,945
They're just hanging, like...

1796
01:18:05,947 --> 01:18:08,447
They look like they're being
Rescued by a helicopter

1797
01:18:08,449 --> 01:18:09,682
From a mountain.

1798
01:18:09,684 --> 01:18:14,253
[Imitates helicopter]

1799
01:18:14,255 --> 01:18:16,656
They've been trapped
On a mountain together.

1800
01:18:16,658 --> 01:18:18,658
Zipped together
In a sleeping bag.

1801
01:18:18,660 --> 01:18:21,027
[Shuddering]

1802
01:18:21,029 --> 01:18:23,095
"If we ever get out of this,

1803
01:18:23,097 --> 01:18:27,332
I'll never call you lefty again.
I'm sorry."

1804
01:18:27,334 --> 01:18:29,102
And then my dick is, like,

1805
01:18:29,104 --> 01:18:32,638
Happy and shiny
And young-looking.

1806
01:18:32,640 --> 01:18:34,774
My penis is, like, a young,
21-year-old guy

1807
01:18:34,776 --> 01:18:36,709
Walking down with these
Two old guys following him.

1808
01:18:36,711 --> 01:18:38,144
Hey, man, hang back.

1809
01:18:38,146 --> 01:18:40,012
I'm trying to get some pussy.
Get out of here.

1810
01:18:40,014 --> 01:18:44,117
[Elderly voice]
"Wait for us."

1811
01:18:44,119 --> 01:18:45,952
And at some point,
I got to show this shit

1812
01:18:45,954 --> 01:18:47,353
To some poor,
Unfortunate woman

1813
01:18:47,355 --> 01:18:49,922
That has to see this
Fucked up package of mine.

1814
01:18:49,924 --> 01:18:50,990
I don't know what--

1815
01:18:50,992 --> 01:18:52,591
Like, i'll tuck my balls
Between my legs.

1816
01:18:52,593 --> 01:18:54,127
"I don't have balls.
I just have a penis.

1817
01:18:54,129 --> 01:18:57,163
Is that okay?"

1818
01:18:57,165 --> 01:18:58,831
That must be weird for women,

1819
01:18:58,833 --> 01:19:01,801
That you don't know what kind of
Dick and balls you're gonna get

1820
01:19:01,803 --> 01:19:05,104
Until it's way too late.

1821
01:19:05,106 --> 01:19:07,539
Like, it's the last
Thing you see.

1822
01:19:07,541 --> 01:19:09,075
And it doesn't seem fair.

1823
01:19:09,077 --> 01:19:10,376
It should be the first
Thing you see.

1824
01:19:10,378 --> 01:19:12,078
Every date should start
With a guy taking out--

1825
01:19:12,080 --> 01:19:13,512
"Is this gonna be okay?"

1826
01:19:13,514 --> 01:19:15,447
"Yeah, that's fine.
It's gonna be worth my time.

1827
01:19:15,449 --> 01:19:18,184
Go ahead and put it away.
We'll deal with it later."

1828
01:19:18,186 --> 01:19:19,786
'Cause you don't--

1829
01:19:19,788 --> 01:19:22,188
You don't find out till you're
Looking down the barrel of it,

1830
01:19:22,190 --> 01:19:24,223
And it's really too late now.

1831
01:19:24,225 --> 01:19:27,226
Like, "oh, Jesus."

1832
01:19:27,228 --> 01:19:28,594
And the dick's
Looking up at you,

1833
01:19:28,596 --> 01:19:29,662
And it's all...

1834
01:19:29,664 --> 01:19:31,764
Like, "this is,
Like, a Dr. Seuss tree.

1835
01:19:31,766 --> 01:19:35,000
"I don't even--
It's all yellowy brown

1836
01:19:35,002 --> 01:19:39,706
With sprigs coming out."

1837
01:19:39,708 --> 01:19:41,073
And women are so nice.

1838
01:19:41,075 --> 01:19:42,541
I don't know a single story

1839
01:19:42,543 --> 01:19:44,510
of a woman who finally gets
A guy's dick out and goes,

1840
01:19:44,512 --> 01:19:46,245
"No. That--no.

1841
01:19:46,247 --> 01:19:48,747
"That's not your dick.
Come on!

1842
01:19:48,749 --> 01:19:49,916
"Take out your penis.

1843
01:19:49,918 --> 01:19:50,917
"That's not a penis.

1844
01:19:50,919 --> 01:19:53,352
That's bullshit."

1845
01:19:53,354 --> 01:19:57,757
They just go, "okay.
Oh, fuck.

1846
01:19:57,759 --> 01:20:00,893
What hole can i put this in
That'll depress me the least?"

1847
01:20:08,736 --> 01:20:10,135
And i have--
I have met some women

1848
01:20:10,137 --> 01:20:11,237
Since i been single,

1849
01:20:11,239 --> 01:20:12,571
And they've been younger,
Mostly,

1850
01:20:12,573 --> 01:20:13,973
Because women my age--

1851
01:20:13,975 --> 01:20:15,441
I like women my age,

1852
01:20:15,443 --> 01:20:17,309
But they're mostly either
Married with children

1853
01:20:17,311 --> 01:20:18,978
Or in a room alone,
Angry and crazy.

1854
01:20:18,980 --> 01:20:20,479
One or the other.

1855
01:20:20,481 --> 01:20:23,482
They're not out looking
To fuck a comic, generally.

1856
01:20:23,484 --> 01:20:25,684
But young women
Are up for something.

1857
01:20:25,686 --> 01:20:27,753
They'll fuck you and do
Other things later.

1858
01:20:27,755 --> 01:20:29,088
Like...

1859
01:20:29,090 --> 01:20:30,856
And also,
With younger women,

1860
01:20:30,858 --> 01:20:32,759
I'm in competition
With younger guys,

1861
01:20:32,761 --> 01:20:34,660
And younger guys
Are not very subtle.

1862
01:20:34,662 --> 01:20:36,528
They don't really know
How to talk to a woman

1863
01:20:36,530 --> 01:20:37,496
Even their own age.

1864
01:20:37,498 --> 01:20:38,898
They're just kind of all--

1865
01:20:38,900 --> 01:20:40,966
Like, penis skin's been grafted
On their whole body.

1866
01:20:40,968 --> 01:20:42,768
They're just--
[Mutters]

1867
01:20:42,770 --> 01:20:44,703
"Can i--is this...

1868
01:20:44,705 --> 01:20:47,807
"Is this is a fuck date?
'Cause i...

1869
01:20:47,809 --> 01:20:51,243
I just want to put my come
In your body."

1870
01:20:51,245 --> 01:20:52,845
It's just a lot of pressure.

1871
01:20:52,847 --> 01:20:54,146
And then the young woman
Meets me,

1872
01:20:54,148 --> 01:20:55,580
And i'm like, "hey, look,

1873
01:20:55,582 --> 01:20:58,117
"I've been jerking off in
The guest room for 15 years.

1874
01:20:58,119 --> 01:20:59,551
"I'm like the man
In the iron mask.

1875
01:20:59,553 --> 01:21:01,987
I'm just happy to be out."

1876
01:21:04,557 --> 01:21:06,659
Young guys are--
They're afraid of women.

1877
01:21:06,661 --> 01:21:08,560
They're afraid
of their feelings.

1878
01:21:08,562 --> 01:21:10,362
"My girlfriend's mad at me!"

1879
01:21:10,364 --> 01:21:12,198
Well, later she won't be.

1880
01:21:12,200 --> 01:21:15,000
Fucking calm down.

1881
01:21:15,002 --> 01:21:16,401
They're afraid
of their bodies.

1882
01:21:16,403 --> 01:21:17,803
They're afraid
of women's bodies.

1883
01:21:17,805 --> 01:21:19,805
"My girlfriend's having
Her period. What do i do?"

1884
01:21:19,807 --> 01:21:21,607
Fuck her in the period hole,
You idiot.

1885
01:21:21,609 --> 01:21:23,809
What is--what's the dilemma?

1886
01:21:23,811 --> 01:21:25,244
I don't give a shit.

1887
01:21:25,246 --> 01:21:27,446
If you're having your period,
Come on over.

1888
01:21:27,448 --> 01:21:30,149
I'm 41. I'm--i'll fuck
The shit out of you.

1889
01:21:30,151 --> 01:21:32,351
I'll drink the blood.
Let's party.

1890
01:21:36,456 --> 01:21:37,956
Thank you very much, guys.

1891
01:21:37,958 --> 01:21:39,925
You guys--you were great.

1892
01:21:39,927 --> 01:21:42,494
Thank you.

1893
01:21:42,496 --> 01:21:47,767
[Cheers and applause]
