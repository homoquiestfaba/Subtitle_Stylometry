1
00:03:45,432 --> 00:03:46,432
Got it.

2
00:03:47,399 --> 00:03:48,504
Gonna work?

3
00:03:48,538 --> 00:03:49,884
Would've work.

4
00:03:49,919 --> 00:03:50,919
All right.

5
00:04:03,829 --> 00:04:05,728
Wanna see what she do?

6
00:04:05,762 --> 00:04:06,625
Dang right.

7
00:04:06,660 --> 00:04:07,660
Get in.

8
00:04:20,743 --> 00:04:24,471
This thing ain't even
close to street legal.

9
00:04:24,505 --> 00:04:26,300
We get out on the
highway with this thing

10
00:04:26,335 --> 00:04:28,371
Sheriff Wilkin's
gonna kick our butts.

11
00:04:28,406 --> 00:04:30,235
Can't kick what he can't catch.

12
00:04:34,204 --> 00:04:35,204
Yeah!

13
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:58,228
Hey, man, we better head back
and get ready for the party.

14
00:04:58,263 --> 00:04:59,333
I'm ready.

15
00:04:59,368 --> 00:05:00,990
You want to go in this?

16
00:05:01,024 --> 00:05:02,578
Yeah, why not?

17
00:05:03,751 --> 00:05:05,822
You ain't even got headlights.

18
00:05:14,624 --> 00:05:15,867
Hey, hey.

19
00:05:15,901 --> 00:05:18,352
Why don't we just go
back to the lake instead?

20
00:05:18,387 --> 00:05:21,148
Man, this our graduation, Lurvy.

21
00:05:21,182 --> 00:05:23,150
What, you getting
cramped up or something?

22
00:05:23,184 --> 00:05:24,496
No, no, I'm good.

23
00:05:24,531 --> 00:05:25,531
All right.

24
00:05:45,172 --> 00:05:46,725
Here you go, man.

25
00:05:52,144 --> 00:05:53,939
That car is so cool.

26
00:05:54,940 --> 00:05:57,943
Even your daddy's car
won't get you laid, Bryson.

27
00:05:57,978 --> 00:05:59,704
It'll get me to the party.

28
00:06:06,711 --> 00:06:07,815
Here we go.

29
00:06:09,438 --> 00:06:10,991
It's just Bryson.

30
00:06:11,025 --> 00:06:13,476
He just don't know when to quit.

31
00:06:33,047 --> 00:06:35,360
Open your eyes, Lurvy.

32
00:06:35,395 --> 00:06:36,810
Tell him bye bye.

33
00:06:48,787 --> 00:06:51,997
What you stopping at
your Uncle Charlie's for?

34
00:06:52,032 --> 00:06:54,414
I told him I'd bring it back.

35
00:07:06,564 --> 00:07:07,944
Oh, my goodness.

36
00:07:13,778 --> 00:07:15,262
Well, look at this.

37
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:20,301
How are you, sir?

38
00:07:20,336 --> 00:07:21,993
Good, good to see you, Ty.

39
00:07:22,027 --> 00:07:22,856
So good to see you.

40
00:07:22,890 --> 00:07:24,685
Lurvy.

41
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:25,835
Come on, Lurvy, stop
messing around, man.

42
00:07:25,859 --> 00:07:27,377
What do we have here?

43
00:07:27,412 --> 00:07:29,966
Said I'd show you the car
that's win state this year.

44
00:07:30,001 --> 00:07:31,036
What you think?

45
00:07:31,071 --> 00:07:32,486
What happened
to all the windows?

46
00:07:32,521 --> 00:07:34,177
Yeah, it's pretty stripped down.

47
00:07:34,212 --> 00:07:35,938
Don't even have headlights.

48
00:07:35,972 --> 00:07:37,353
You think we got a winner?

49
00:07:37,387 --> 00:07:39,113
Yes, sir, I do.

50
00:07:39,148 --> 00:07:40,390
Yes, sir, I do.

51
00:07:41,978 --> 00:07:44,153
So tell me I'm not
gonna lose my best foreman

52
00:07:44,187 --> 00:07:45,672
to a race car this summer.

53
00:07:45,706 --> 00:07:46,707
No, sir, no, sir.

54
00:07:46,742 --> 00:07:49,779
I'll be full-time
starting Monday morning.

55
00:07:49,814 --> 00:07:51,850
I'm just kidding you boys.

56
00:07:51,885 --> 00:07:53,069
Well, I don't want to
hold you up, Uncle Charlie.

57
00:07:53,093 --> 00:07:54,795
Y'all be careful out
there in this thing tonight.

58
00:07:54,819 --> 00:07:55,820
Yes, sir.

59
00:07:56,959 --> 00:07:57,960
You have fun.

60
00:07:57,994 --> 00:07:58,994
I will.

61
00:08:02,102 --> 00:08:06,106
Come on, Lurvy,
stop messing around, man.

62
00:08:06,934 --> 00:08:08,798
Be careful, boys.

63
00:08:08,833 --> 00:08:10,248
Yes, sir.

64
00:08:12,250 --> 00:08:13,250
Oh.

65
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:37,033
Oh, hey there, Bryson.

66
00:08:37,068 --> 00:08:38,932
Maybe next time, huh?

67
00:08:43,074 --> 00:08:44,074
Bryson?

68
00:08:45,007 --> 00:08:47,043
Yeah, he's got it.

69
00:08:47,078 --> 00:08:48,458
He's got what?

70
00:08:48,493 --> 00:08:50,115
He's got that look.

71
00:08:50,150 --> 00:08:51,150
Hey, Ty.

72
00:08:56,984 --> 00:08:59,193
Man, I'd be all over that.

73
00:08:59,228 --> 00:09:00,781
I'm in training, Lurvy.

74
00:09:00,816 --> 00:09:02,172
Man, put your tongue
in your mouth.

75
00:09:02,196 --> 00:09:03,577
What are you doing?

76
00:09:03,612 --> 00:09:06,338
You don't never give
her the time of day.

77
00:09:06,373 --> 00:09:08,237
I gave her the time of day once.

78
00:09:08,271 --> 00:09:11,274
That's why she keeps rubbing
on me like a house cat.

79
00:09:11,309 --> 00:09:12,309
You did?

80
00:09:14,795 --> 00:09:15,795
Man, you did?

81
00:09:20,939 --> 00:09:22,665
I don't know what
he's doing here?

82
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:24,633
Did he build that piece of crap?

83
00:09:24,667 --> 00:09:26,807
Yeah, and his uncle paid for it.

84
00:09:26,842 --> 00:09:27,877
Wrecked the last one.

85
00:09:27,912 --> 00:09:29,810
Thinks he's gonna
go pro or something.

86
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:31,880
Pro?

87
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:33,711
We can count on it.

88
00:09:33,745 --> 00:09:34,643
He's gonna end up
drunk in the clay pit

89
00:09:34,677 --> 00:09:36,058
just like his daddy.

90
00:09:43,306 --> 00:09:44,306
Hey, Ty.

91
00:09:47,690 --> 00:09:51,211
Racing's one thing,
my daddy's another.

92
00:09:58,874 --> 00:10:00,496
What's he doing here?

93
00:10:00,530 --> 00:10:01,542
Becky Fleming's
on a date with him.

94
00:10:01,566 --> 00:10:02,809
Shut up, Bryson.

95
00:10:08,780 --> 00:10:10,161
Lookie, lookie.

96
00:10:10,195 --> 00:10:13,302
It's the little engine
that almost could.

97
00:10:13,336 --> 00:10:16,719
Didn't you graduate
about five years ago?

98
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:27,972
Hey, Ty.

99
00:10:28,006 --> 00:10:29,006
Hey, Becky.

100
00:10:38,258 --> 00:10:39,846
All right, Lurvy.

101
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:41,330
Screw this party.

102
00:11:12,913 --> 00:11:15,571
Snake's just an asshole.

103
00:11:15,605 --> 00:11:19,713
Yeah, I don't know what
Becky Fleming sees in him.

104
00:11:20,749 --> 00:11:22,026
She's about fine, too.

105
00:11:22,060 --> 00:11:23,060
Yeah.

106
00:11:23,786 --> 00:11:27,721
Well, she was until she
started hanging on him.

107
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:30,517
Man, look.

108
00:11:30,551 --> 00:11:33,623
There's just some things
that are out of our league.

109
00:11:33,658 --> 00:11:36,557
Like winning the
state championship.

110
00:11:37,317 --> 00:11:39,457
You got to stop all that talk.

111
00:11:39,491 --> 00:11:41,804
We ain't even won
the local track,

112
00:11:41,839 --> 00:11:43,806
and that money your
Uncle Charlie gave you,

113
00:11:43,841 --> 00:11:47,948
ain't nothing up to what Turner
Auto spends on Snake's car.

114
00:11:50,951 --> 00:11:54,679
Yeah, some things you
don't need money for, Lurvy.

115
00:11:54,714 --> 00:11:57,337
And you're a better mechanic
than anybody they got.

116
00:11:57,371 --> 00:11:58,752
Don't you forget that, man.

117
00:11:58,787 --> 00:12:01,824
I wish you'd stop
saying that, too.

118
00:12:04,862 --> 00:12:06,622
Look, Lurvy.

119
00:12:06,656 --> 00:12:07,796
I mean, here it is, right?

120
00:12:07,830 --> 00:12:09,349
Graduation.

121
00:12:09,383 --> 00:12:11,731
People going off to college.

122
00:12:12,662 --> 00:12:14,319
We can't afford that.

123
00:12:15,596 --> 00:12:18,979
Way I see it, I'm only
really good at one thing,

124
00:12:19,014 --> 00:12:21,223
and that's driving cars.

125
00:12:21,257 --> 00:12:25,399
That's the only chance I got
at making something of myself.

126
00:12:26,297 --> 00:12:29,231
I don't want to end up
another drunk in clay pit.

127
00:12:29,265 --> 00:12:30,715
Man, don't say that.

128
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:33,269
There ain't nobody
that thinks like that.

129
00:12:33,304 --> 00:12:35,271
And forget about Bryson.

130
00:12:35,306 --> 00:12:37,860
He's just a loud mouth.

131
00:12:37,895 --> 00:12:40,552
Yep, and people
that don't say nothing

132
00:12:40,587 --> 00:12:42,209
are pretty loud, too.

133
00:12:49,872 --> 00:12:51,978
Let's get on out of here.

134
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:28,083
They don't think I
can do it, Daddy.

135
00:13:30,292 --> 00:13:31,638
What about you?

136
00:13:36,263 --> 00:13:37,263
Come on.

137
00:13:38,714 --> 00:13:40,198
Can't do it myself.

138
00:14:12,023 --> 00:14:13,922
How's he looking, Lurvy?

139
00:14:13,956 --> 00:14:15,958
He's looking pretty good.

140
00:14:15,993 --> 00:14:18,167
I'm about to wave him in.

141
00:14:18,202 --> 00:14:21,964
Probably need to take some
weight off the outside though.

142
00:14:21,999 --> 00:14:24,449
Oh, look, there's Snake.

143
00:14:24,484 --> 00:14:26,003
He don't even hot lap, does he?

144
00:14:26,037 --> 00:14:27,970
No, not usually.

145
00:14:28,005 --> 00:14:29,938
Well, good luck
on the money run.

146
00:14:29,972 --> 00:14:31,491
I appreciate it.

147
00:14:42,778 --> 00:14:44,090
Come on, man, you ready?

148
00:14:44,124 --> 00:14:45,885
I'm almost done.

149
00:14:45,919 --> 00:14:47,679
You like the tires?

150
00:14:47,714 --> 00:14:50,924
No, that'll have to do.

151
00:14:50,959 --> 00:14:53,340
You raise that right
top four link bar?

152
00:14:53,375 --> 00:14:54,134
Yes, man.

153
00:14:54,169 --> 00:14:56,205
Come on, it's time to go.

154
00:14:59,829 --> 00:15:02,660
It's a little different than
a lawnmower engine, isn't it?

155
00:15:02,694 --> 00:15:04,731
Like you anything
about an engine.

156
00:15:04,765 --> 00:15:06,664
Bring Daddy's
mechanics with you?

157
00:15:06,698 --> 00:15:08,711
You know you can tinker with
that junkyard piece of crap

158
00:15:08,735 --> 00:15:09,874
all you want.

159
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:11,876
When you're ready to
run with the big boys

160
00:15:11,911 --> 00:15:12,922
why don't you come on out.

161
00:15:12,946 --> 00:15:16,053
I might not put you
in the wall again.

162
00:15:18,469 --> 00:15:19,539
You ready?

163
00:15:19,573 --> 00:15:20,573
Yeah.

164
00:15:21,817 --> 00:15:23,370
Bastard's mine.

165
00:15:25,407 --> 00:15:26,407
All right, folks.

166
00:15:27,374 --> 00:15:28,627
We got the street stop feature
coming out of the gate.

167
00:15:28,651 --> 00:15:31,723
Local boy, Ty Hargrove, is
back and I mean way back

168
00:15:31,758 --> 00:15:34,623
after a bad crash against
the wall a couple weeks ago.

169
00:15:34,657 --> 00:15:38,006
He's got a new sponsor
Aldwin Tow and.

170
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:41,802
Let's see if he can get some
points back on the board.

171
00:15:41,837 --> 00:15:43,977
On the first row taking
the inside position

172
00:15:44,012 --> 00:15:47,222
is our point leader, Snake
Turner, in the number 15 car.

173
00:15:47,256 --> 00:15:51,398
On the high side is Lloyd
Briggs in the number 12 car.

174
00:16:16,976 --> 00:16:18,908
Easy on turn one, Ty.

175
00:16:39,377 --> 00:16:41,724
Don't take it too low now.

176
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:43,623
Coming down the
front stretch is Snake Turner

177
00:16:43,657 --> 00:16:48,352
in the lead with Ty Hargrove
breathing hard down his neck.

178
00:16:48,386 --> 00:16:49,905
Stay high.

179
00:16:49,939 --> 00:16:52,321
Catch him on the straight away.

180
00:16:55,911 --> 00:16:57,223
Don't you do it, Ty.

181
00:16:57,257 --> 00:16:59,397
Come on, you know better.

182
00:17:07,785 --> 00:17:10,615
Come on, man, get back in there.

183
00:18:46,815 --> 00:18:48,196
I got mine over
at the gift shop.

184
00:18:48,230 --> 00:18:49,887
Whoa, that's cool.

185
00:18:53,718 --> 00:18:54,892
You have fun tonight, buddy?

186
00:18:54,926 --> 00:18:55,926
Yes, sir.

187
00:18:59,759 --> 00:19:02,900
Do you think you can beat Snake?

188
00:19:02,934 --> 00:19:05,420
I was just warming up tonight.

189
00:19:19,710 --> 00:19:20,710
Hey.

190
00:19:22,747 --> 00:19:24,301
You want to get in bed?

191
00:19:24,335 --> 00:19:26,303
What time is it?

192
00:19:26,337 --> 00:19:28,546
About one in the morning.

193
00:19:30,928 --> 00:19:33,827
I was close tonight, Dad.

194
00:19:33,862 --> 00:19:34,862
So close.

195
00:19:35,657 --> 00:19:37,866
It was right there.

196
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:40,006
I can beat him, I know it.

197
00:19:42,422 --> 00:19:46,737
I'ma ride up there with
you on the next one, son.

198
00:19:46,771 --> 00:19:48,946
You said last time.

199
00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:51,983
She's kicking my butt, boy.

200
00:19:52,018 --> 00:19:53,789
Well, kind of looks like
you're kicking your own butt

201
00:19:53,813 --> 00:19:54,813
around here.

202
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:59,508
Y'all know nothing about this.

203
00:19:59,543 --> 00:20:01,855
It made you taught me.

204
00:20:01,890 --> 00:20:05,928
I know if anybody's quitting
right now, it's you.

205
00:20:09,932 --> 00:20:11,624
Just won't stick.

206
00:20:13,764 --> 00:20:16,905
I ain't got the right stuff.

207
00:20:16,939 --> 00:20:17,939
But you did.

208
00:20:18,734 --> 00:20:19,873
You still do.

209
00:20:23,394 --> 00:20:27,226
Tell you what, I'll
make a deal with you.

210
00:20:27,260 --> 00:20:28,260
All right?

211
00:20:29,055 --> 00:20:32,679
I qualify for state,
you gotta get straight.

212
00:20:32,714 --> 00:20:33,508
How about that?

213
00:20:33,542 --> 00:20:34,923
That's fair, right?

214
00:20:37,374 --> 00:20:38,823
Ain't gonna be
nothing if I got at it

215
00:20:38,858 --> 00:20:41,032
all worried about you anyway.

216
00:20:41,067 --> 00:20:44,795
Just not right in my head
when you're like this.

217
00:20:44,829 --> 00:20:46,003
Come on, Daddy.

218
00:20:48,799 --> 00:20:51,733
I'm afraid to make that deal.

219
00:20:51,767 --> 00:20:52,767
Why?

220
00:20:58,809 --> 00:21:01,605
Because I know you gonna win it.

221
00:21:04,780 --> 00:21:07,887
And when you do, I
will let you down.

222
00:21:33,395 --> 00:21:36,985
Ty, can you
come to the office, please?

223
00:21:37,019 --> 00:21:39,746
Ty, will you come to the office?

224
00:21:55,831 --> 00:21:56,867
Hey, Cindy.

225
00:21:56,901 --> 00:21:58,040
Hey, Ty.

226
00:21:58,075 --> 00:21:58,938
Come on in, son.

227
00:21:58,972 --> 00:22:02,113
Hey Uncle Charlie, Aunt Paula.

228
00:22:02,148 --> 00:22:03,287
Morning, Ty.

229
00:22:03,322 --> 00:22:04,323
How are you, son?

230
00:22:04,357 --> 00:22:06,290
Good to see you today.

231
00:22:06,325 --> 00:22:08,223
I'll just leave
the two of you alone.

232
00:22:08,257 --> 00:22:09,811
You have a good day, sweetheart.

233
00:22:09,845 --> 00:22:10,846
Thank you.

234
00:22:10,881 --> 00:22:11,640
You, too.

235
00:22:11,675 --> 00:22:12,434
Aunt Paula.

236
00:22:12,469 --> 00:22:14,505
Sweetheart.

237
00:22:14,540 --> 00:22:16,196
Tomato sandwiches, huh?

238
00:22:16,231 --> 00:22:19,027
Oh, she's been
making these for me a long time.

239
00:22:19,061 --> 00:22:19,821
She's a good one.

240
00:22:19,855 --> 00:22:20,822
Yes, sir.

241
00:22:20,856 --> 00:22:22,386
You sure have been
moving a lot of poles

242
00:22:22,410 --> 00:22:23,410
across the yard lately.

243
00:22:24,135 --> 00:22:24,826
I'm really proud of
the job you're doing.

244
00:22:24,860 --> 00:22:25,620
Thank you, sir.

245
00:22:25,654 --> 00:22:26,654
I appreciate that.

246
00:22:27,484 --> 00:22:28,139
I sure wish Frank
would've taken to this place

247
00:22:28,174 --> 00:22:29,831
like you have.

248
00:22:29,865 --> 00:22:32,281
Well, I know Frank wants
to go to college first, sir.

249
00:22:32,316 --> 00:22:35,043
And knowing Frank
he's probably goofing

250
00:22:35,077 --> 00:22:36,769
Well, it is college, sir.

251
00:22:36,803 --> 00:22:38,011
I'm sure he'll be just fine.

252
00:22:38,046 --> 00:22:39,610
Yeah, well I don't
want to talk about that.

253
00:22:39,634 --> 00:22:41,670
We got a lot of good stuff
going on around here.

254
00:22:41,705 --> 00:22:43,189
We've been meeting
with investors,

255
00:22:43,223 --> 00:22:45,674
and we're gonna start
making concrete poles.

256
00:22:45,709 --> 00:22:47,952
We just closed on a piece
of property up the road.

257
00:22:47,987 --> 00:22:49,620
We're looking for a man
to run the operation.

258
00:22:49,644 --> 00:22:51,484
I told them that I think
I've got the right man

259
00:22:51,508 --> 00:22:52,405
for that operation.

260
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:53,199
Okay.

261
00:22:53,233 --> 00:22:55,374
And I think that man's you.

262
00:22:55,408 --> 00:22:56,408
Me?

263
00:22:57,721 --> 00:22:59,619
If you're interested in the job.

264
00:22:59,654 --> 00:23:00,793
Well, yes, sir.

265
00:23:00,827 --> 00:23:01,828
Yeah.

266
00:23:01,863 --> 00:23:02,863
I tell you what.

267
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:04,210
We're gonna have a
little cocktail party

268
00:23:04,244 --> 00:23:05,522
with the business men tomorrow.

269
00:23:05,556 --> 00:23:07,800
Why don't you leave
work a little bit early

270
00:23:07,834 --> 00:23:09,284
and go home put some
nice clothes on,

271
00:23:09,318 --> 00:23:11,044
and I'll pick you up
about six o'clock.

272
00:23:11,079 --> 00:23:11,838
Sound good?

273
00:23:11,873 --> 00:23:12,953
You serious, Uncle Charlie?

274
00:23:12,977 --> 00:23:13,771
Absolutely.

275
00:23:13,806 --> 00:23:14,979
Thank you, sir.

276
00:23:15,014 --> 00:23:15,842
Get on out of here
and go back to work.

277
00:23:15,877 --> 00:23:16,877
All right.

278
00:23:19,570 --> 00:23:21,676
I'm gonna do what
I can with this intake.

279
00:23:21,710 --> 00:23:24,057
See if I can get some
more horsepower out of it.

280
00:23:24,092 --> 00:23:26,474
How much for a new carburetor?

281
00:23:26,508 --> 00:23:28,130
Well, about $400.

282
00:23:28,165 --> 00:23:29,787
Dang.

283
00:23:29,822 --> 00:23:32,203
She can suck up some dough.

284
00:23:32,238 --> 00:23:34,896
Tires be another
thousand, right?

285
00:23:34,930 --> 00:23:35,930
Yup.

286
00:23:37,795 --> 00:23:40,522
Well, I might get
the money next week.

287
00:23:40,557 --> 00:23:43,214
Why don't you give me what
you can on the intake now.

288
00:23:43,249 --> 00:23:44,399
I'll just hold it on turn one,

289
00:23:44,423 --> 00:23:46,597
she'll still be in
the race, right?

290
00:23:46,632 --> 00:23:47,632
Oh, yeah.

291
00:24:16,696 --> 00:24:17,525
Hey, Daddy.

292
00:24:17,559 --> 00:24:18,559
Hey, son.

293
00:24:20,976 --> 00:24:25,671
Please tell me you boys
still think about girls.

294
00:24:25,705 --> 00:24:26,879
I do.

295
00:24:26,913 --> 00:24:28,846
So I'm gonna end up like you?

296
00:24:28,881 --> 00:24:30,227
Some floozy I gotta shake.

297
00:24:30,261 --> 00:24:32,781
Easy on your old man, boy.

298
00:24:32,816 --> 00:24:35,612
Guess who Uncle Charlie's
making manager of the new plant?

299
00:24:35,646 --> 00:24:36,475
What?

300
00:24:36,509 --> 00:24:37,337
That's right.

301
00:24:37,372 --> 00:24:38,200
Well, well, well.

302
00:24:38,235 --> 00:24:39,374
I'm proud of you, son.

303
00:24:39,408 --> 00:24:40,489
Got some big
meeting tomorrow night

304
00:24:40,513 --> 00:24:41,894
with all the investors.

305
00:24:41,928 --> 00:24:43,723
We're gonna have to
get you cleaned up.

306
00:24:43,758 --> 00:24:44,862
Right, yeah.

307
00:24:44,897 --> 00:24:46,519
Right.

308
00:24:46,554 --> 00:24:50,385
Hey, maybe something
with some buttons.

309
00:24:50,419 --> 00:24:52,111
Might need a suit.

310
00:24:52,145 --> 00:24:52,939
Yeah, Ty.

311
00:24:52,974 --> 00:24:54,872
Hell with that.

312
00:24:54,907 --> 00:24:58,497
Come on, Daddy, let me
show what we got done.

313
00:25:25,731 --> 00:25:26,801
Come on in.

314
00:25:33,462 --> 00:25:34,671
How are you, Jack?

315
00:25:34,705 --> 00:25:37,156
Trying to get this
place cleaned up, Charlie.

316
00:25:37,190 --> 00:25:38,813
I'm almost ready, Uncle Charlie.

317
00:25:38,847 --> 00:25:40,331
Take your time, Ty.

318
00:25:40,366 --> 00:25:41,712
A little bit early.

319
00:25:42,955 --> 00:25:44,784
How's the dirt
business, brother?

320
00:25:44,819 --> 00:25:46,717
Man, I can't complain.

321
00:25:49,340 --> 00:25:51,653
Been a long while, man.

322
00:25:51,688 --> 00:25:52,965
Yeah, too long.

323
00:25:54,242 --> 00:25:55,761
You know I appreciate everything

324
00:25:55,795 --> 00:25:58,384
you've been doing for him.

325
00:25:58,418 --> 00:25:59,765
Not doing him any favors.

326
00:25:59,799 --> 00:26:02,664
He's worked hard for
everything he's got coming.

327
00:26:02,699 --> 00:26:06,081
He's the best hand I
got at the pole plant.

328
00:26:09,084 --> 00:26:12,294
Will you look
at that lady killer.

329
00:26:12,329 --> 00:26:13,399
What you think?

330
00:26:13,433 --> 00:26:14,433
Looks good, Ty.

331
00:26:15,159 --> 00:26:16,309
I ironed the hell
out of this shirt.

332
00:26:16,333 --> 00:26:17,817
And you impress them, son.

333
00:26:17,852 --> 00:26:18,887
Yes, sir.

334
00:26:18,922 --> 00:26:20,509
You just be yourself.

335
00:26:20,544 --> 00:26:21,303
You ready?

336
00:26:21,338 --> 00:26:23,305
Let's do it.

337
00:26:23,340 --> 00:26:24,030
Good to see you, Jack.

338
00:26:24,065 --> 00:26:25,618
Good to see you, brother.

339
00:26:25,653 --> 00:26:26,930
Y'all be good now.

340
00:26:37,630 --> 00:26:39,839
How many people are
gonna be here, Uncle Charlie?

341
00:26:39,874 --> 00:26:41,945
Not too awfully many.

342
00:26:41,979 --> 00:26:44,810
The investors are gonna be here.

343
00:26:44,844 --> 00:26:47,571
I don't really want you
to be too nervous now.

344
00:26:47,606 --> 00:26:49,228
I know this is real important.

345
00:26:49,262 --> 00:26:50,367
I know, Uncle Charlie.

346
00:26:50,401 --> 00:26:53,025
But you know, you
just be yourself.

347
00:26:53,059 --> 00:26:55,544
And just be respectful, okay?

348
00:26:55,579 --> 00:26:56,579
Yes, sir.

349
00:26:58,409 --> 00:27:01,102
This Becky Fleming's house.

350
00:27:01,136 --> 00:27:04,726
Yeah, Lyle Fleming is
one of the investors.

351
00:27:22,744 --> 00:27:25,540
I've known the man for
30 years, and I do trust...

352
00:27:25,574 --> 00:27:26,506
Excuse me.

353
00:27:26,541 --> 00:27:27,749
There they are.

354
00:27:29,095 --> 00:27:29,958
Good to see you, Lyle.

355
00:27:29,993 --> 00:27:31,028
Good to see you.

356
00:27:31,063 --> 00:27:32,961
This must be our horse, Charlie.

357
00:27:32,996 --> 00:27:34,342
This is Ty Hargrove.

358
00:27:34,376 --> 00:27:35,526
Nice to meet you, Dr. Fleming.

359
00:27:35,550 --> 00:27:36,803
I hear you knew about everything

360
00:27:36,827 --> 00:27:38,484
there is to know about poles.

361
00:27:38,518 --> 00:27:40,279
Trying to know as
much as I can, sir.

362
00:27:40,313 --> 00:27:42,522
Charlie says you're quite
a race car driver, too.

363
00:27:42,557 --> 00:27:43,938
Well, yeah.

364
00:27:43,972 --> 00:27:45,802
I guess you can call
it a hobby, sir.

365
00:27:45,836 --> 00:27:47,636
Is it like the NASCAR
I've seen on television?

366
00:27:47,666 --> 00:27:49,978
It's mostly homemade
rigs all on a dirt track.

367
00:27:50,013 --> 00:27:54,949
NASCAR will do some dirt, but
that's mostly asphalt stuff.

368
00:27:54,983 --> 00:27:55,984
Hi.

369
00:27:56,019 --> 00:27:56,778
Hey.

370
00:27:56,813 --> 00:27:57,572
What are you doing here?

371
00:27:57,606 --> 00:27:58,780
You know, Ty?

372
00:27:58,815 --> 00:28:00,679
Yeah, from school, Daddy.

373
00:28:00,713 --> 00:28:01,645
I thought you're
spending the night over

374
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:03,751
at McCane's house tonight?

375
00:28:03,785 --> 00:28:05,649
No, mom wanted me to stay.

376
00:28:05,684 --> 00:28:06,823
Help with the party.

377
00:28:06,857 --> 00:28:08,490
Ty's gonna be plant manager
of the new pole mill

378
00:28:08,514 --> 00:28:11,759
in my with Charlie Hargrove.

379
00:28:11,793 --> 00:28:12,793
That's right.

380
00:28:13,553 --> 00:28:14,738
Uncle Charlie wanted
me to meet everybody.

381
00:28:14,762 --> 00:28:15,832
Excuse us.

382
00:29:10,852 --> 00:29:12,958
You look like you'd
rather be anywhere but here.

383
00:29:12,992 --> 00:29:14,787
Hey, Becky.

384
00:29:14,822 --> 00:29:16,651
Na, I just get the
feeling they think I'm

385
00:29:16,685 --> 00:29:19,516
the only one who knows about
making telephone poles.

386
00:29:19,550 --> 00:29:21,621
Well, then you must know a lot.

387
00:29:21,656 --> 00:29:25,280
I just know what
Uncle Charlie taught me.

388
00:29:25,315 --> 00:29:28,836
Well, it's obvious you
know a lot about cars.

389
00:29:28,870 --> 00:29:31,977
I think Snake's actually
worried about you.

390
00:29:32,011 --> 00:29:36,119
Your daddy don't know
you go to the races, do he?

391
00:29:37,810 --> 00:29:39,950
It's not really his thing.

392
00:29:43,747 --> 00:29:46,992
What's the thing about Snake?

393
00:29:47,026 --> 00:29:48,752
He hasn't said much.

394
00:29:50,443 --> 00:29:51,938
But he knows his daddy
owns a Dodge dealership

395
00:29:51,962 --> 00:29:53,481
in Atmore, right?

396
00:29:53,515 --> 00:29:54,965
That makes him okay.

397
00:29:59,107 --> 00:30:03,318
I'm sorry, what does that
have to do with anything?

398
00:30:04,768 --> 00:30:05,804
Nothing.

399
00:30:05,838 --> 00:30:06,943
I'm just kidding.

400
00:30:08,599 --> 00:30:12,845
Well, maybe I'll see
you around the track.

401
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:13,880
Okay?

402
00:30:14,813 --> 00:30:17,608
Oh, tell Snake to watch his ass.

403
00:30:18,402 --> 00:30:19,402
I will.

404
00:30:35,143 --> 00:30:36,835
Well, the lake
models are about to line up

405
00:30:36,869 --> 00:30:38,526
for the money run, folks.

406
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:40,148
Will our local boy, Ty Hargrove,

407
00:30:40,183 --> 00:30:42,323
beat out our board
leader Snake Turner?

408
00:30:42,357 --> 00:30:43,117
Well, we'll see.

409
00:30:43,151 --> 00:30:44,231
It's gonna be a great race.

410
00:30:44,256 --> 00:30:45,360
Let's have some fun.

411
00:31:00,065 --> 00:31:02,619
Can our local boy, Ty
Hargrove, do it tonight?

412
00:31:02,653 --> 00:31:05,725
Ladies and gentlemen,
I don't think so.

413
00:31:16,805 --> 00:31:17,806
Come on, Ty.

414
00:31:17,841 --> 00:31:18,841
Right now.

415
00:31:27,230 --> 00:31:28,231
Now.

416
00:31:37,723 --> 00:31:40,139
You don't have him.

417
00:31:40,174 --> 00:31:41,830
You don't have him.

418
00:31:43,832 --> 00:31:44,937
Well, that's it, folks.

419
00:31:44,972 --> 00:31:46,673
Hope you can stay around
for the big party tonight.

420
00:31:46,697 --> 00:31:49,804
Donnick is back, and we've got
cold drinks, snacks, shirts,

421
00:31:49,838 --> 00:31:51,806
decals, Indian blankets,
jams and jellies,

422
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:54,671
and left-handed
nostril inhalers.

423
00:32:00,573 --> 00:32:02,334
Hey, Ricky.

424
00:32:02,368 --> 00:32:04,094
Hey, man, you got a
tuner bar I can borrow?

425
00:32:04,129 --> 00:32:05,129
Yeah, actually I do, man.

426
00:32:05,889 --> 00:32:07,529
It's over in the trailer
on the left side.

427
00:32:07,856 --> 00:32:08,719
Just whenever you get done
if I'm not over there,

428
00:32:08,754 --> 00:32:09,720
just put it back in there.

429
00:32:09,755 --> 00:32:10,583
Appreciate it man.

430
00:32:10,618 --> 00:32:11,446
Yeah, Charlie
bumped me out there.

431
00:32:11,481 --> 00:32:12,861
Knocked something loose.

432
00:32:12,896 --> 00:32:14,622
Weld it all this last week, too.

433
00:32:14,656 --> 00:32:16,313
Man, it's always
something, right?

434
00:32:16,348 --> 00:32:17,107
But don't worry about it, man.

435
00:32:17,142 --> 00:32:18,177
You did great tonight.

436
00:32:18,212 --> 00:32:19,316
Thanks, man.

437
00:32:19,351 --> 00:32:21,053
I still can't get up
there with Snake though.

438
00:32:21,077 --> 00:32:23,148
We're gonna change
out the carburetor this week.

439
00:32:23,182 --> 00:32:25,184
Man, it's definitely
a horsepower problem.

440
00:32:25,219 --> 00:32:26,841
You're getting through
the corners sweet.

441
00:32:26,875 --> 00:32:28,370
You got the driving,
you got the handling.

442
00:32:28,394 --> 00:32:29,154
Good job.

443
00:32:29,188 --> 00:32:30,914
Thanks, Ricky.

444
00:32:30,949 --> 00:32:31,880
All right, Lurvy.

445
00:32:31,915 --> 00:32:32,743
Wanna grab that bar
and call it a night?

446
00:32:32,778 --> 00:32:36,023

Did you really give
her the time of day?

00:33:34,322 --> 00:33:35,979
Fine.

470
00:33:36,014 --> 00:33:37,567
Did good tonight.

471
00:33:37,601 --> 00:33:39,879
I can do better.

472
00:33:39,914 --> 00:33:40,708
Yeah, well.

473
00:33:40,742 --> 00:33:43,055
Everyone around
here's been slick.

474
00:33:43,090 --> 00:33:46,127
Yeah, well they like
me better if I won.

475
00:33:46,162 --> 00:33:47,266
Snake's tough.

476
00:33:48,095 --> 00:33:49,510
Oh, well he left already.

477
00:33:49,544 --> 00:33:52,513
He said he had to
work on his car.

478
00:33:52,547 --> 00:33:53,893
All right.

479
00:33:53,928 --> 00:33:55,067
Y'all want some drinks?

480
00:33:55,102 --> 00:33:56,896
You can get drinks here.

481
00:33:56,931 --> 00:33:59,485
I can get whatever I want here.

482
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:00,520
Sure.

483
00:34:18,194 --> 00:34:19,781
What are you doing?

484
00:34:20,989 --> 00:34:21,990
Relax, man.

485
00:34:22,025 --> 00:34:23,958
Her dad's my new boss.

486
00:34:23,992 --> 00:34:27,272
Yeah, and Snake's her boyfriend.

487
00:34:27,306 --> 00:34:30,171
Well, listen to you
Mr. Sherry My Dreams.

488
00:34:30,206 --> 00:34:33,657
I'm not Mr. Sherry My Dreams.

489
00:34:33,692 --> 00:34:35,349
She's right over there, man.

490
00:34:35,383 --> 00:34:36,902
Looking at you.

491
00:34:36,936 --> 00:34:38,110
She's not looking at me.

492
00:34:38,145 --> 00:34:39,387
She's looking at you.

493
00:34:39,422 --> 00:34:41,217
Four beers.

494
00:34:41,251 --> 00:34:43,322
You just keep that.

495
00:34:43,357 --> 00:34:44,082
I'm going over there, man.

496
00:34:44,116 --> 00:34:45,911
Keep her some company.

497
00:34:48,224 --> 00:34:49,121
That's right, man.

498
00:34:49,156 --> 00:34:50,122
One for her one for you.

499
00:34:50,157 --> 00:34:51,882
That's how it works.

500
00:35:05,172 --> 00:35:06,172
Wanna dance?

501
00:35:07,657 --> 00:35:08,796
Yeah, sure.

502
00:35:08,830 --> 00:35:09,831
Can you hold that?

503
00:35:09,866 --> 00:35:11,212

Who taught you?

509
00:35:38,101 --> 00:35:39,101
Mama.

510
00:35:42,485 --> 00:35:43,531
Daddy would never dance with us

511
00:35:43,555 --> 00:35:46,282
so she used to swing
me around the kitchen.

512
00:35:46,316 --> 00:35:48,353
She sounds like fun.

513
00:35:48,387 --> 00:35:49,387
Yeah.

514
00:35:50,113 --> 00:35:51,770

Don't be.

519
00:36:01,883 --> 00:36:05,024
Would've been worse
if she stayed.

520
00:36:05,059 --> 00:36:09,167
Things got so bad for two
years I didn't go to school.

521
00:36:11,721 --> 00:36:14,379
But you graduated.

522
00:36:14,413 --> 00:36:16,139
Yeah, a little late.

523
00:36:17,278 --> 00:36:20,626
Bet your ass I was
going to that party.

524
00:36:22,110 --> 00:36:24,872
Your Uncle Charlie's
your dad's brother.

525
00:36:24,906 --> 00:36:26,184
Yeah.

526
00:36:26,218 --> 00:36:27,875
Taught me a lot.

527
00:36:27,909 --> 00:36:30,671
Yeah, he's like a nice guy.

528
00:36:30,705 --> 00:36:32,466
Best one I know.

529
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:35,607
Probably one of the
best jobs in town.

530
00:36:38,230 --> 00:36:39,300
I've tried to.

531
00:36:41,268 --> 00:36:42,200
What about you?

532
00:36:42,234 --> 00:36:44,236
What do you do?

533
00:36:44,271 --> 00:36:47,446
I work at my daddy's clinic.

534
00:36:47,481 --> 00:36:48,827
Front office stuff.

535
00:36:48,861 --> 00:36:51,381
It's really not interesting.

536
00:36:51,416 --> 00:36:54,315
How'd you get
involved with Snake?

537
00:36:55,730 --> 00:36:57,111
He asked me out.

538
00:36:58,595 --> 00:37:00,494
It's that easy.

539
00:37:00,528 --> 00:37:01,633
Pretty much.

540
00:37:02,461 --> 00:37:04,946
You must get asked out a lot.

541
00:37:06,362 --> 00:37:07,466
Not really.

542
00:37:09,468 --> 00:37:12,575
Doesn't really
seem like your type.

543
00:37:14,266 --> 00:37:17,165
Okay, and how do
you know my type?

544
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:19,927
Well, it sure ain't jackasses.

545
00:37:23,758 --> 00:37:27,728
Daddy's list of approved
colors isn't very long.

546
00:37:28,901 --> 00:37:32,111
Does he approve
of race car drivers?

547
00:37:41,604 --> 00:37:45,021
<i>♪ Talk about sitting</i>
on the hood of my car ♪

548
00:37:45,055 --> 00:37:46,298
<i>♪ Covered in a blanket ♪</i>

549
00:37:46,333 --> 00:37:49,888
<i>♪ Looking up at the stars ♪</i>

550
00:37:53,754 --> 00:37:56,274
Oh, you got to be kidding me.

551
00:38:23,335 --> 00:38:25,958
You gonna make me
ask, aren't you?

552
00:38:25,993 --> 00:38:28,064
Don't worry about it, man.

553
00:38:29,721 --> 00:38:32,033
Man, when did all that start.

554
00:38:32,068 --> 00:38:34,346
It started when you saw it.

555
00:38:34,381 --> 00:38:35,381
You better be careful.

556
00:38:36,175 --> 00:38:38,212
He's gonna run you into
the wall again, Ty.

557
00:38:38,246 --> 00:38:41,629
Not if you fix it
so I'm ahead of him.

558
00:38:54,401 --> 00:38:57,438
You know my wife has
your number on her car.

559
00:38:57,473 --> 00:38:58,646
No kidding.

560
00:38:58,681 --> 00:38:59,613
Yeah, we're rooting for you

561
00:38:59,647 --> 00:39:00,797
to go to the state championship.

562
00:39:00,821 --> 00:39:01,822
All right.

563
00:39:01,856 --> 00:39:04,618
- Appreciate the support man.
- Sure.

564
00:39:09,139 --> 00:39:11,383
You been calling her or what?

565
00:39:11,418 --> 00:39:14,144
Yeah, I've been calling her.

566
00:39:14,179 --> 00:39:16,423
What's her daddy think?

567
00:39:16,457 --> 00:39:19,840
I don't think
she's told him yet.

568
00:39:19,874 --> 00:39:23,050
How she gonna go to the
race with both of you there?

569
00:39:23,084 --> 00:39:24,292
My truck.

570
00:39:26,847 --> 00:39:28,987
Well, that's it, new carburetor.

571
00:39:29,021 --> 00:39:30,851
Ought to give us
40 more horsepower.

572
00:39:30,885 --> 00:39:32,646
All right.

573
00:39:32,680 --> 00:39:34,786
How much money we got left?

574
00:39:34,820 --> 00:39:37,789
Enough to buy a tank of
gas and some peel offs.

575
00:39:37,823 --> 00:39:38,859
Gotta get some tires.

576
00:39:38,893 --> 00:39:39,893
Yup.

577
00:39:41,068 --> 00:39:44,589
Well, believe we've done
all we can on the carburetor?

578
00:39:44,623 --> 00:39:47,592
Unless you've got $1,200
more bucks for a TCC custom.

579
00:39:47,626 --> 00:39:49,973
Yeah, what's Snake at?

580
00:39:50,008 --> 00:39:51,872
He's got a TCC custom

581
00:39:51,906 --> 00:39:54,633
and $1,200 more dollars
that's for sure.

582
00:39:54,668 --> 00:39:57,636
Well, just have to
get a heavier foot.

583
00:40:10,546 --> 00:40:13,341
Man, it's all you tonight.

584
00:40:13,376 --> 00:40:15,999
Got a new carburetor,
suspension's dead on,

585
00:40:16,034 --> 00:40:16,828
Snake's a no-show.

586
00:40:16,862 --> 00:40:18,346
Man, that pisses me off.

587
00:40:18,381 --> 00:40:19,934
I ain't complaining.

588
00:40:19,969 --> 00:40:21,833
Dude, this is our
chance to catch up.

589
00:40:21,867 --> 00:40:23,051
He knows he can blow
off an entire race

590
00:40:23,075 --> 00:40:25,664
and still roll out of here
with more points than me.

591
00:40:25,699 --> 00:40:28,943
Man, if we win tonight
we're almost tied with him.

592
00:40:28,978 --> 00:40:30,324
Yeah, you're right.

593
00:40:30,358 --> 00:40:33,638
Let him get cocky,
I'm right on his ass.

594
00:40:46,754 --> 00:40:48,825
Can our local boy Ty
Hargrove do it tonight?

595
00:40:48,860 --> 00:40:50,137
I think he might.

596
00:40:50,171 --> 00:40:51,425
Ladies and gentlemen,
there doesn't look like

597
00:40:51,449 --> 00:40:52,588
there's much competition,

598
00:40:52,622 --> 00:40:54,831
and Snake Turner
didn't even show up.

599
00:41:48,575 --> 00:41:49,966
- We need those points, man.
- That was awesome.

600
00:41:49,990 --> 00:41:50,818
- We need those points.
- I know.

601
00:41:50,853 --> 00:41:51,785
We're good now, we're good.

602
00:41:51,819 --> 00:41:52,819
Oh, great.

603
00:41:54,926 --> 00:41:56,617
Oh, cool it, partner.

604
00:41:56,652 --> 00:41:58,550
Are you with this loser, Becky?

605
00:41:58,585 --> 00:42:00,966
Oh, you got something
you want to say to me?

606
00:42:01,001 --> 00:42:01,760
You bitch!

607
00:42:01,795 --> 00:42:02,795
Ty, Ty, stop.

608
00:42:04,038 --> 00:42:04,936
No, leave it.

609
00:42:04,970 --> 00:42:05,970
Come on.

610
00:42:07,904 --> 00:42:08,904
Stop.

611
00:42:09,596 --> 00:42:10,596
Stop it.

612
00:42:11,563 --> 00:42:13,047
Stop, knock it off.

613
00:42:15,705 --> 00:42:17,742
Wanna play that way?

614
00:42:45,148 --> 00:42:47,772
You might have a
slight concussion.

615
00:42:47,806 --> 00:42:49,290
Is that bad?

616
00:42:49,325 --> 00:42:50,844
He'll be okay.

617
00:42:50,878 --> 00:42:53,709
He needs to stay
with us tonight.

618
00:42:53,743 --> 00:42:56,781
Let me have a word
with you, Becky.

619
00:42:59,577 --> 00:43:01,475
What were you doing
at the race track?

620
00:43:01,509 --> 00:43:02,234
That's what he does.

621
00:43:02,269 --> 00:43:03,269
I was with him.

622
00:43:03,857 --> 00:43:04,685
That might be what he does,

623
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:06,007
but that's no place
for a nice girl.

624
00:43:06,031 --> 00:43:08,620
Daddy, when you
say nice you mean rich.

625
00:43:08,655 --> 00:43:09,794
I mean nice.

626
00:43:09,828 --> 00:43:11,830
You're going to
college next year.

627
00:43:11,865 --> 00:43:15,075
You're not gonna work
at a grocery store.

628
00:43:16,248 --> 00:43:20,218
It wasn't about you, Ty, but
this isn't a place for Becky.

629
00:43:20,252 --> 00:43:21,252
I get it.

630
00:43:22,807 --> 00:43:23,842
You okay, man?

631
00:43:23,877 --> 00:43:27,156
Yeah, take me home, man.

632
00:43:27,190 --> 00:43:28,374
You should go to
the hospital tomorrow

633
00:43:28,398 --> 00:43:30,504
and have that checked out.

634
00:43:38,650 --> 00:43:40,756
Man, that was about me.

635
00:43:42,412 --> 00:43:45,761
What do you expect
from a man like that?

636
00:44:00,085 --> 00:44:01,777
Hey, cuz, what's up?

637
00:44:01,811 --> 00:44:02,950
Good to see you, man.

638
00:44:02,985 --> 00:44:04,780
Looks like dad's been
a little rough on you.

639
00:44:04,814 --> 00:44:05,815
Oh.

640
00:44:06,678 --> 00:44:07,714
Yeah, little scuffle.

641
00:44:08,853 --> 00:44:09,854
Nothing serious though.

642
00:44:09,888 --> 00:44:11,107
Thought you were up
at university, man.

643
00:44:11,131 --> 00:44:12,373
I have been.

644
00:44:13,789 --> 00:44:16,308
I'm just in for a little bit.

645
00:44:16,343 --> 00:44:17,931
How's it looking up there?

646
00:44:17,965 --> 00:44:20,002
Making the team or what?

647
00:44:21,659 --> 00:44:23,833
I don't know, man.

648
00:44:23,868 --> 00:44:26,318
I really don't know
what I'm gonna do.

649
00:44:26,353 --> 00:44:28,010
I don't think I'm
gonna go to school

650
00:44:28,044 --> 00:44:30,771
if I can't play football.

651
00:44:30,806 --> 00:44:32,877
I mean, you can try your
odds somewhere else though.

652
00:44:32,911 --> 00:44:34,223
Yeah, we'll see.

653
00:44:36,466 --> 00:44:38,883
Anyway, I just want to stop by.

654
00:44:38,917 --> 00:44:40,539
See how things were going.

655
00:44:40,574 --> 00:44:41,854
Yeah, man, it's going all right.

656
00:44:41,886 --> 00:44:42,852
You know.

657
00:44:42,887 --> 00:44:44,164
Well, I'll see you around, man.

658
00:44:44,198 --> 00:44:45,165
Good seeing you, Frank.

659
00:44:45,199 --> 00:44:45,959
You, too.

660
00:44:45,993 --> 00:44:46,993
Okay.

661
00:44:53,967 --> 00:44:55,416
Come on in, Ty.

662
00:45:01,112 --> 00:45:03,286
I hear you're quite
the attraction.

663
00:45:03,321 --> 00:45:04,840
Oh, well.

664
00:45:04,874 --> 00:45:08,326
Just a couple of us
are local down there.

665
00:45:08,360 --> 00:45:09,360
Ah, yeah.

666
00:45:10,984 --> 00:45:12,468
You heard.

667
00:45:12,502 --> 00:45:13,641
I heard.

668
00:45:13,676 --> 00:45:15,505
I can see, too.

669
00:45:15,540 --> 00:45:17,611
I might have messed up, sir.

670
00:45:17,645 --> 00:45:19,509
It happens.

671
00:45:19,544 --> 00:45:21,270
I could've helped this.

672
00:45:21,304 --> 00:45:24,307
Yeah, I hear you might
even be going to state.

673
00:45:24,342 --> 00:45:25,757
I don't know about that.

674
00:45:25,792 --> 00:45:27,942
I mean, even if I did I'm not
sure what I'd do about it.

675
00:45:27,966 --> 00:45:30,728
You know, I got
responsibilities around here.

676
00:45:30,762 --> 00:45:31,970
Can't just leave.

677
00:45:32,005 --> 00:45:33,869
Oh, don't make me
have to fire you.

678
00:45:33,903 --> 00:45:36,319
All this will be waiting
on you when you get back.

679
00:45:36,354 --> 00:45:39,702
This chair to be yours some day.

680
00:45:39,737 --> 00:45:40,565
I'm serious, you know.

681
00:45:40,599 --> 00:45:42,291
You're like a son to me.

682
00:45:42,325 --> 00:45:44,051
I've always felt that way.

683
00:45:44,086 --> 00:45:46,847
No different than my own kids.

684
00:45:46,882 --> 00:45:48,331
Thank you, sir.

685
00:45:48,366 --> 00:45:50,748
You still pulling that car
around with that old 1500?

686
00:45:50,782 --> 00:45:51,645
Yes, sir.

687
00:45:51,679 --> 00:45:52,508
Well, sometimes.

688
00:45:52,542 --> 00:45:53,820
Lurvy and I'll switch out

689
00:45:53,854 --> 00:45:55,822
so we don't burn up
our transmissions.

690
00:45:55,856 --> 00:45:56,857
Tell you what.

691
00:45:56,892 --> 00:45:58,963
Why don't you take
that old diesel?

692
00:45:58,997 --> 00:45:59,826
I know it's old.

693
00:45:59,860 --> 00:46:01,793
It's got about
250,000 miles on it,

694
00:46:01,828 --> 00:46:03,519
but she still runs good.

695
00:46:03,553 --> 00:46:04,762
A lot of power.

696
00:46:05,728 --> 00:46:07,178
That old beast in the yard.

697
00:46:07,212 --> 00:46:08,317
Yeah.

698
00:46:08,351 --> 00:46:09,180
All right.

699
00:46:09,214 --> 00:46:09,974
Thank you, sir.

700
00:46:10,008 --> 00:46:10,940
I'll get her cleaned up.

701
00:46:10,975 --> 00:46:12,977
What else do you need, son?

702
00:46:13,011 --> 00:46:14,979
Na, we're all
right, Uncle Charlie...

703
00:46:15,013 --> 00:46:16,774
Ty, what do you need?

704
00:46:17,775 --> 00:46:20,225
We need tires, sir.

705
00:46:20,260 --> 00:46:21,399
Is that all?

706
00:46:22,572 --> 00:46:24,712
Just need tires, sir.

707
00:46:24,747 --> 00:46:26,300
Why don't you go up to Sweats

708
00:46:26,335 --> 00:46:30,511
and pick out what you want,
put it on the account, okay?

709
00:46:30,546 --> 00:46:31,305
Wow.

710
00:46:31,340 --> 00:46:32,824
Thank you, Uncle Charlie.

711
00:46:32,859 --> 00:46:34,446
Really appreciate it.

712
00:46:34,481 --> 00:46:35,896
You seen Frank?

713
00:46:37,208 --> 00:46:39,382
Yeah, I saw Frank.

714
00:46:39,417 --> 00:46:40,843
I don't know if he's
gonna turn out to be

715
00:46:40,867 --> 00:46:44,525
the big football star he
thought he was gonna be.

716
00:46:44,560 --> 00:46:47,494
I think he's a little
bit embarrassed.

717
00:46:47,528 --> 00:46:51,153
Maybe he'll come back here
and go to work for you.

718
00:46:51,187 --> 00:46:53,741
Uncle Charlie, I just
wanted you to know that

719
00:46:53,776 --> 00:46:56,848
I appreciate any opportunity
you have for me here.

720
00:46:56,883 --> 00:46:58,091
I just hope you know that.

721
00:46:58,125 --> 00:47:00,956
You just tell me what
you want me to do.

722
00:47:00,990 --> 00:47:03,717
I want you to win that race, Ty.

723
00:47:06,237 --> 00:47:07,237
Yes, sir.

724
00:47:10,724 --> 00:47:11,724
Hey.

725
00:47:13,485 --> 00:47:15,177
Trying to get me in trouble?

726
00:47:15,211 --> 00:47:17,224
No, I just wanted to see
what all the talk was about.

727
00:47:17,248 --> 00:47:19,146
The big investment.

728
00:47:19,181 --> 00:47:20,803
Don't you have work?

729
00:47:20,838 --> 00:47:23,875
No, we close at
noon on Tuesdays.

730
00:47:23,910 --> 00:47:27,292
There's not too much to see yet.

731
00:47:27,327 --> 00:47:29,708
Has my daddy stopped by
to give you a hard time yet?

732
00:47:29,743 --> 00:47:30,882
Na.

733
00:47:30,917 --> 00:47:33,160
It's a fight, right?

734
00:47:33,195 --> 00:47:35,438
What time do you get off?

735
00:47:35,473 --> 00:47:37,026
About four o'clock.

736
00:47:37,924 --> 00:47:41,789
What do you usually
do afterwards?

737
00:47:41,824 --> 00:47:43,895
Go home, work on my car.

738
00:47:44,723 --> 00:47:45,724
Every day.

739
00:47:47,312 --> 00:47:49,832
Yeah, pretty much every day.

740
00:47:49,867 --> 00:47:52,214
Well, what about today?

741
00:47:52,248 --> 00:47:54,216
What you got in mind?

742
00:47:54,250 --> 00:47:55,838
Let's go somewhere.

743
00:47:57,840 --> 00:48:01,568
What's your daddy
gonna think about that?

744
00:48:03,570 --> 00:48:07,229
Shouldn't have said
those things to you.

745
00:48:07,263 --> 00:48:10,301
Yeah, probably right, you know?

746
00:48:10,335 --> 00:48:13,131
You're going off
to college and all.

747
00:48:13,166 --> 00:48:15,340
Well, I didn't say I
wasn't going to college,

748
00:48:15,375 --> 00:48:16,928
but I'm not gone yet.

749
00:48:19,103 --> 00:48:20,103
Okay.

750
00:48:21,070 --> 00:48:23,521
I'd get cleaned up first.

751
00:48:23,555 --> 00:48:24,867
That's fine.

752
00:48:24,902 --> 00:48:27,697
You can just pick me
up when you're done.

753
00:48:27,732 --> 00:48:29,354
Whoa, wait, your house?

754
00:48:29,389 --> 00:48:30,908
Sure.

755
00:48:30,942 --> 00:48:31,942
Why not?

756
00:48:32,944 --> 00:48:33,944
Okay.

757
00:49:04,251 --> 00:49:05,528
- Hey.
- Hey.

758
00:49:05,563 --> 00:49:06,840
Your daddy's not home is he?

759
00:49:06,874 --> 00:49:10,395
No, but he will be
when you drop me off.

760
00:49:46,707 --> 00:49:49,779
Uncle Charlie owns
about 500 acres.

761
00:49:49,814 --> 00:49:52,817
Daddy used to come out
and fish right here.

762
00:49:52,851 --> 00:49:54,370
Why not anymore?

763
00:49:55,613 --> 00:49:59,030
Daddy's not in real good health.

764
00:49:59,065 --> 00:50:00,583
So you tell Snake?

765
00:50:02,413 --> 00:50:03,966
Yeah.

766
00:50:04,001 --> 00:50:05,588
How'd he take it?

767
00:50:06,934 --> 00:50:07,934
Not well.

768
00:50:11,008 --> 00:50:12,043
I just don't get it.

769
00:50:12,078 --> 00:50:13,078
Why Snake?

770
00:50:13,907 --> 00:50:16,806
I mean of all the guys in town.

771
00:50:16,841 --> 00:50:17,841
Snake.

772
00:50:18,739 --> 00:50:19,809
It's a small town.

773
00:50:19,844 --> 00:50:22,640
A girl can have a little fun.

774
00:50:22,674 --> 00:50:24,031
God, Ty, you act
like I married him.

775
00:50:24,055 --> 00:50:25,263
It was nothing.

776
00:50:26,747 --> 00:50:27,747
Okay.

777
00:50:28,715 --> 00:50:32,719
Can you please, please
not think of anything

778
00:50:32,753 --> 00:50:36,033
about Snake or
racing for one night?

779
00:50:36,067 --> 00:50:37,067
Just one.

780
00:50:38,449 --> 00:50:42,729
I just know how I'm
supposed to beat him.

781
00:50:42,763 --> 00:50:45,214
I mean, he's got
everything money can buy.

782
00:50:45,249 --> 00:50:47,803
I mean, money gets
you more horsepower.

783
00:50:47,837 --> 00:50:50,323
More horsepower gets
you up to the front.

784
00:50:50,357 --> 00:50:51,990
And not to mention he's
got a whole car dealership

785
00:50:52,014 --> 00:50:54,499
full of mechanics
working for him.

786
00:50:54,534 --> 00:50:55,534
Full of tires.

787
00:50:56,329 --> 00:50:57,996
I mean, tires are probably
the most important part.

788
00:50:58,020 --> 00:50:59,020
I mean, I...

789
00:51:46,758 --> 00:51:48,795
Well, you're lucky
somebody shut off that loader

790
00:51:48,829 --> 00:51:50,555
before you killed
yourself in it.

791
00:51:50,590 --> 00:51:52,050
I told them to take
me back to the office,

792
00:51:52,074 --> 00:51:53,386
they took me here anyway.

793
00:51:53,420 --> 00:51:55,226
Come on, Daddy, not everyone
can tell the difference

794
00:51:55,250 --> 00:51:58,529
with heatstroke and
passed out drunk.

795
00:51:58,563 --> 00:51:59,563
I know.

796
00:52:01,048 --> 00:52:03,810
Well, how are we
gonna pay for this?

797
00:52:03,844 --> 00:52:05,639
We'll be all right.

798
00:52:05,674 --> 00:52:06,954
Yeah, if somebody can keep a job

799
00:52:06,985 --> 00:52:09,885
when he's smashed on bourbon.

800
00:52:09,919 --> 00:52:13,854
We ain't got doctor's
insurance, right?

801
00:52:13,889 --> 00:52:14,648
Dang.

802
00:52:14,683 --> 00:52:15,723
Well, I mean, we got what?

803
00:52:16,478 --> 00:52:17,489
Three hundred a month
around the office, right?

804
00:52:17,513 --> 00:52:20,551
We got payments on at
the loader and the pit.

805
00:52:21,793 --> 00:52:24,969
I guess, I can stop
putting money into the car.

806
00:52:25,003 --> 00:52:26,395
You ain't just sit there
and get pickle all day

807
00:52:26,419 --> 00:52:27,696
while I pay for everything.

808
00:52:27,730 --> 00:52:29,663
I guess, I'll live there, too.

809
00:52:29,698 --> 00:52:31,493
You don't even
talk like that, son.

810
00:52:31,527 --> 00:52:34,151
Don't make me think
like that, Daddy.

811
00:52:34,185 --> 00:52:35,185
Dang, Daddy.

812
00:52:36,808 --> 00:52:38,362
You look ridiculous.

813
00:52:39,639 --> 00:52:40,639
Get up.

814
00:52:41,468 --> 00:52:45,714
This place is too expensive
to lie there and dry up.

815
00:52:57,381 --> 00:52:58,209
Bye, Ty.

816
00:52:58,244 --> 00:52:59,728
All right, man.

817
00:53:00,798 --> 00:53:01,937
Hey, brother.

818
00:53:10,739 --> 00:53:13,880
Cause some heart
attacks around here.

819
00:53:50,882 --> 00:53:53,160
Hey, check that out.

820
00:53:53,195 --> 00:53:55,508
Yeah, got a fan.

821
00:53:55,542 --> 00:53:56,957
Whatever.

822
00:53:56,992 --> 00:53:58,349
So you have a number
all over town.

823
00:53:58,373 --> 00:53:59,695
It's like you were Kyle
Petty or something.

824
00:53:59,719 --> 00:54:01,893
What you know about Kyle Petty?

825
00:54:01,928 --> 00:54:04,793
I underestimate
you, Tyler Hargrove.

826
00:54:06,933 --> 00:54:10,730
I figure you did your
shopping in the city.

827
00:54:10,764 --> 00:54:14,803
Family practitioners aren't
exactly millionaires, Ty.

828
00:54:14,837 --> 00:54:18,289
All the money's in the
specialty practices.

829
00:54:18,324 --> 00:54:20,602
Come on, it can't be that bad.

830
00:54:20,636 --> 00:54:22,604
You got some pretty nice stuff.

831
00:54:22,638 --> 00:54:25,986
Yeah, no, it's not that bad.

832
00:54:26,021 --> 00:54:27,205
But with college
expenses coming up

833
00:54:27,229 --> 00:54:29,645
it doesn't hurt to be frugal.

834
00:54:31,578 --> 00:54:32,786
Oh, hey, look.

835
00:54:36,825 --> 00:54:38,551
Oh, I have no idea.

836
00:54:38,585 --> 00:54:41,485
I think you'd look
good in anything.

837
00:54:43,176 --> 00:54:44,177
Thank you.

838
00:56:06,639 --> 00:56:09,227
Damn, this thing's fine.

839
00:56:09,262 --> 00:56:11,713
How long did he say
you can keep it for.

840
00:56:11,747 --> 00:56:12,507
I don't know.

841
00:56:12,541 --> 00:56:13,956
He said he didn't need it.

842
00:56:13,991 --> 00:56:15,648
Dang, man.

843
00:56:15,682 --> 00:56:18,409
Hey, how long you got for lunch?

844
00:56:18,444 --> 00:56:19,755
About an hour.

845
00:56:20,756 --> 00:56:23,000
Is that gonna give us
enough time to get these tires

846
00:56:23,034 --> 00:56:25,278
and take them back
to your place?

847
00:56:25,312 --> 00:56:27,107
Man, if we just got
enough time to buy them,

848
00:56:27,142 --> 00:56:28,982
throw them in the truck, and
stare at them a little bit

849
00:56:29,006 --> 00:56:30,904
that'd be enough for me.

850
00:56:44,711 --> 00:56:46,368
Good luck, Ty.

851
00:56:46,403 --> 00:56:48,163
Thanks, Betsy.

852
00:56:48,197 --> 00:56:49,544
Good luck tomorrow night, Ty.

853
00:56:49,578 --> 00:56:50,890
Bringing the whole family.

854
00:56:50,924 --> 00:56:51,787
Thank you, Mr. Chase.

855
00:56:51,822 --> 00:56:52,892
Welcome.

856
00:56:52,926 --> 00:56:54,859
We put your car magnet on.

857
00:56:54,894 --> 00:56:56,078
Thank y'all for supporting me.

858
00:56:56,102 --> 00:56:58,104
I really appreciate that.

859
00:56:59,726 --> 00:57:00,865
Go get them, Ty.

860
00:57:00,900 --> 00:57:02,833
Thank you, sir.

861
00:57:02,867 --> 00:57:04,179
You're like a dang movie star.

862
00:57:04,213 --> 00:57:05,422
Come on, man.

863
00:57:11,289 --> 00:57:12,325
Huh?

864
00:57:12,359 --> 00:57:13,533
Oh, yeah.

865
00:57:13,568 --> 00:57:14,810
That's the one.

866
00:57:20,713 --> 00:57:22,128
Oh, look here.

867
00:57:23,232 --> 00:57:24,061
Hi, Lurvy.

868
00:57:24,095 --> 00:57:25,096
Hey, Becky.

869
00:57:27,927 --> 00:57:29,007
He's been dreaming about engines

870
00:57:29,031 --> 00:57:31,344
since the day he was born.

871
00:57:31,378 --> 00:57:32,378
I'm telling you, Ty.

872
00:57:33,104 --> 00:57:34,496
It ain't shiny, but
it might be as good.

873
00:57:34,520 --> 00:57:35,520
Well, so what?

874
00:57:36,073 --> 00:57:37,353
You think you can
beat Snake now?

875
00:57:37,661 --> 00:57:38,845
I said might be as
good, not as good.

876
00:57:38,869 --> 00:57:40,802
What's Snake's real name?

877
00:57:42,389 --> 00:57:44,184
Well, I don't know.

878
00:57:44,219 --> 00:57:46,532
But you went out with him.

879
00:57:47,533 --> 00:57:50,639
Okay, so I forgot to ask.

880
00:57:50,674 --> 00:57:52,538
I hate calling him that.

881
00:57:52,572 --> 00:57:54,298
It's like agreeing with
him that he's good.

882
00:57:54,332 --> 00:57:55,332
Right?

883
00:57:55,886 --> 00:57:57,819
Lurvy can do magic
with an engine.

884
00:57:57,853 --> 00:58:00,856
Now he squeezed out every last
bit of horsepower possible.

885
00:58:00,891 --> 00:58:04,757
If we ever had a chance to
beat Snake, we got it now.

886
00:58:06,137 --> 00:58:07,691
It's a long shot.

887
00:58:25,812 --> 00:58:27,158
What the hell, man?

888
00:58:27,193 --> 00:58:29,540
We ain't find the heat.

889
00:58:29,575 --> 00:58:30,575
I don't know.

890
00:58:31,231 --> 00:58:32,232
Maybe bad gas.

891
00:58:32,267 --> 00:58:33,026
Bad gas?

892
00:58:33,061 --> 00:58:35,719
Been on the same tank all night.

893
00:58:35,753 --> 00:58:38,066
You boys having car trouble?

894
00:58:41,310 --> 00:58:42,322
I said something to Sherry.

895
00:58:42,346 --> 00:58:43,761
Son of a bitch.

896
00:58:47,247 --> 00:58:48,732
I want to kill him.

897
00:58:53,081 --> 00:58:54,876
You think he did it?

898
00:58:58,293 --> 00:59:02,159
If he did, we can
get him disqualified.

899
00:59:02,193 --> 00:59:04,541
Can't prove nothing.

900
00:59:04,575 --> 00:59:05,887
Let's get back on the trailer.

901
00:59:05,921 --> 00:59:06,681
We got to get back in the race.

902
00:59:06,715 --> 00:59:08,993
We ain't in the race, Lurvy!

903
00:59:21,765 --> 00:59:23,111
What are you doing?

904
00:59:23,145 --> 00:59:24,561
Waiting on him.

905
00:59:25,700 --> 00:59:27,978
He's on the winner's block, man.

906
00:59:28,012 --> 00:59:30,497
Got to come this way
eventually, don't he?

907
00:59:30,532 --> 00:59:33,811
Come on, you're just gonna
get us all kicked out of here.

908
00:59:33,846 --> 00:59:36,089
I can't let this go, man.

909
00:59:38,782 --> 00:59:39,783
Yeah, you can.

910
00:59:39,817 --> 00:59:41,543
I got a better idea.

911
00:59:41,578 --> 00:59:42,337
What?

912
00:59:42,371 --> 00:59:44,235
Come on, follow me to the car.

913
00:59:44,270 --> 00:59:45,133
What, man?

914
00:59:45,167 --> 00:59:46,686
Come on.

915
01:00:02,115 --> 01:00:05,049
Okay, just sit
down and cool off.

916
01:00:09,744 --> 01:00:11,815
This better be good, man.

917
01:00:16,820 --> 01:00:18,373
Turn one, Ty.

918
01:00:18,407 --> 01:00:20,789
You can spin him on turn one.

919
01:00:20,824 --> 01:00:24,034
What are you talking about, man?

920
01:00:24,068 --> 01:00:26,761
I'm talking about Snake.

921
01:00:26,795 --> 01:00:28,486
I watched him race tonight,

922
01:00:28,521 --> 01:00:30,385
and he almost lost
it on turn one.

923
01:00:30,419 --> 01:00:31,869
He still won, didn't he?

924
01:00:31,904 --> 01:00:35,562
Well, yeah, but he's
slow through the turns

925
01:00:35,597 --> 01:00:37,185
and fast on the straight aways.

926
01:00:37,219 --> 01:00:41,948
Two times Ike Smith was right
on his tail, slid past him.

927
01:00:41,983 --> 01:00:45,469
Snake got nervous then
almost lost it for no reason.

928
01:00:45,503 --> 01:00:46,539
Don't you see?

929
01:00:46,573 --> 01:00:47,954
No, Lurvy, he still won.

930
01:00:47,989 --> 01:00:49,069
What are you trying to say?

931
01:00:49,991 --> 01:00:51,855
Snake's fast, but he
can't handle the pressure.

932
01:00:51,889 --> 01:00:53,753
You're fast you
don't have pressure.

933
01:00:53,788 --> 01:00:55,997
You can beat him on the turns.

934
01:00:56,031 --> 01:00:59,932
With these tires, hell, you
can even get low on turn three.

935
01:00:59,966 --> 01:01:01,588
This car's perfect.

936
01:01:02,555 --> 01:01:04,695
Yeah, except it doesn't run.

937
01:01:04,730 --> 01:01:06,939
To hell with that, I
can clean out the bad gas.

938
01:01:06,973 --> 01:01:09,873
You're ready to go
again in no time.

939
01:01:11,288 --> 01:01:12,772
Son of a bitch.

940
01:01:32,033 --> 01:01:35,692
Why don't you just
ask her to dance?

941
01:01:35,726 --> 01:01:36,831
Who?

942
01:01:36,865 --> 01:01:38,695
Sherry.

943
01:01:38,729 --> 01:01:39,730
Oh, Sherry.

944
01:01:40,904 --> 01:01:42,664
He won't ask her.

945
01:01:44,217 --> 01:01:45,217
Why not?

946
01:01:48,152 --> 01:01:49,015
I don't know.

947
01:01:49,050 --> 01:01:50,050
Why not man?

948
01:01:51,224 --> 01:01:53,226
Well, I just thought...

949
01:01:55,470 --> 01:01:56,609
I don't know.

950
01:01:58,473 --> 01:02:00,613
You talk to her enough.

951
01:02:00,647 --> 01:02:02,649
You might as well, right?

952
01:02:02,684 --> 01:02:03,858
She's right there, man.

953
01:02:03,892 --> 01:02:04,892
Go ask her.

954
01:02:07,793 --> 01:02:09,967
Go ask her, man.

955
01:02:10,002 --> 01:02:11,279
Okay.

956
01:02:11,313 --> 01:02:12,383
Okay.

957
01:02:12,418 --> 01:02:13,418
I will.

958
01:02:25,949 --> 01:02:28,606
You seem distracted tonight.

959
01:02:29,746 --> 01:02:30,747
You think?

960
01:02:35,475 --> 01:02:36,475
I'm sorry.

961
01:02:39,548 --> 01:02:42,655
You still have a
chance, don't you?

962
01:02:44,933 --> 01:02:46,176
Statistically, yes.

963
01:02:46,210 --> 01:02:48,557
But realistically it's over.

964
01:02:50,905 --> 01:02:51,905
Oh, come on.

965
01:02:52,665 --> 01:02:54,185
All you have to do
is win next weekend.

966
01:02:54,218 --> 01:02:58,119
Snake can't do any
better than third place.

967
01:02:58,153 --> 01:03:01,812
Two things I've
never seen happen.

968
01:03:01,847 --> 01:03:03,227
Well, I think you can do it.

969
01:03:03,262 --> 01:03:05,298
Still hasn't asked her.

970
01:03:09,199 --> 01:03:11,201
You're no fun tonight.

971
01:03:18,139 --> 01:03:19,139
Sorry.

972
01:03:20,037 --> 01:03:22,591
Just wore out and pissed off.

973
01:03:24,766 --> 01:03:25,871
Wanna get out of here?

974
01:03:25,905 --> 01:03:27,631
Do this another night?

975
01:03:28,459 --> 01:03:29,875
Sure.

976
01:03:29,909 --> 01:03:31,980
I'll walk you to your car.

977
01:03:43,785 --> 01:03:45,131
Hey, Blake.

978
01:03:45,166 --> 01:03:46,166
Hey, Ty.

979
01:03:47,271 --> 01:03:49,480
Man, I am sorry
about last night.

980
01:03:49,515 --> 01:03:50,274
What happened?

981
01:03:50,309 --> 01:03:52,207
Car trouble, man.

982
01:03:52,242 --> 01:03:55,624
Well, you still got
a shot though, right?

983
01:03:55,659 --> 01:03:57,557
It's not looking good, you know?

984
01:03:57,592 --> 01:03:58,662
It's a long shot.

985
01:03:58,696 --> 01:03:59,939
Oh, come on.

986
01:03:59,974 --> 01:04:01,354
There's always next year.

987
01:04:01,389 --> 01:04:03,218
I mean, think
about it, right now

988
01:04:03,253 --> 01:04:06,187
you have an incredible job,
the most awesome sponsor,

989
01:04:06,221 --> 01:04:08,948
dude, it's just
a matter of time.

990
01:04:08,983 --> 01:04:10,605
Yeah, you're
probably right, man.

991
01:04:10,639 --> 01:04:12,089
I appreciate it.

992
01:04:12,124 --> 01:04:12,883
Thanks, brother.

993
01:04:12,918 --> 01:04:14,747
Have a good one, man.

994
01:04:37,425 --> 01:04:38,425
Yeah.

995
01:04:45,743 --> 01:04:46,883
Hey, Daddy.

996
01:04:47,814 --> 01:04:48,885
Daddy!

997
01:06:39,719 --> 01:06:42,481
I know how much he meant to you.

998
01:06:46,795 --> 01:06:51,007
You think it would've been
me have a heart attack.

999
01:06:53,837 --> 01:06:54,837
Me, right?

1000
01:06:55,597 --> 01:06:57,427
I don't want to
talk about it, Daddy.

1001
01:06:57,461 --> 01:06:58,461
All right?

1002
01:07:15,617 --> 01:07:18,310
Yeah, you might as
well get started.

1003
01:07:18,344 --> 01:07:20,967
Don't hold back
on account of me.

1004
01:07:24,902 --> 01:07:25,902
Put that down.

1005
01:07:27,802 --> 01:07:29,079
Hey, put it down.

1006
01:07:32,634 --> 01:07:36,880
It ain't right you were too
damn drunk to go see him.

1007
01:07:46,752 --> 01:07:48,788
What I got now, Daddy?

1008
01:07:52,378 --> 01:07:54,139
Daddy, what I got now?

1009
01:07:59,730 --> 01:08:00,730
Nothing.

1010
01:08:31,107 --> 01:08:32,280
Hey, Ty.

1011
01:08:32,315 --> 01:08:33,315
Hey, Frank.

1012
01:08:35,387 --> 01:08:36,871
Aunt Paula.

1013
01:08:36,905 --> 01:08:37,768
Just thought I'd come by

1014
01:08:37,803 --> 01:08:40,771
and see if there's
anything I can do.

1015
01:08:43,809 --> 01:08:46,812
I don't know what
all this is, Ty.

1016
01:08:47,640 --> 01:08:50,816
He always took care
of everything himself.

1017
01:08:50,850 --> 01:08:51,955
You know that.

1018
01:08:54,923 --> 01:08:58,272
Customers are calling
asking me questions.

1019
01:08:59,100 --> 01:09:01,792
Lyle Fleming called, wants
to know what's going on

1020
01:09:01,827 --> 01:09:03,967
at the concrete plant.

1021
01:09:04,001 --> 01:09:08,109
Oh, isn't there like a manual
or handbook or something?

1022
01:09:11,457 --> 01:09:13,597
Look, you guys deal with Cindy

1023
01:09:13,632 --> 01:09:15,599
and all the office
procedures, all right?

1024
01:09:15,634 --> 01:09:17,877
I'll take care of everything
outside the office,

1025
01:09:17,912 --> 01:09:19,948
the yard, everything else.

1026
01:09:19,983 --> 01:09:22,641
Tell Dr. Fleming to
come see me, all right?

1027
01:09:22,675 --> 01:09:23,642
You want me to go
out there with you,

1028
01:09:23,676 --> 01:09:24,953
I'll go out there with you.

1029
01:09:24,988 --> 01:09:26,576
Sure, man, come on.

1030
01:09:31,995 --> 01:09:33,410
Thank you, Ty.

1031
01:09:37,483 --> 01:09:39,623
I hope you like
tomato sandwiches.

1032
01:09:39,658 --> 01:09:40,486
Yes, ma'am, thank you.

1033
01:09:40,521 --> 01:09:42,212
It's become a habit.

1034
01:09:44,041 --> 01:09:47,148
Ty, thank you for everything.

1035
01:09:47,183 --> 01:09:50,220
Welcome, ma'am,
least I could do.

1036
01:09:50,255 --> 01:09:51,463
Come on, Frank.

1037
01:09:54,224 --> 01:09:55,812
Bye, sweetheart.

1038
01:09:59,609 --> 01:10:00,817
I can do this.

1039
01:10:22,735 --> 01:10:24,461
What a mess.

1040
01:10:24,496 --> 01:10:26,808
Uncle Charlie meant
a lot around here.

1041
01:10:26,843 --> 01:10:28,983
They'll come through for him.

1042
01:10:29,017 --> 01:10:30,640
Who's in charge now?

1043
01:10:30,674 --> 01:10:32,124
I guess Frank.

1044
01:10:32,158 --> 01:10:34,471
I mean of this place.

1045
01:10:34,506 --> 01:10:36,715
I don't plan on quitting.

1046
01:10:37,785 --> 01:10:40,305
Are we gonna stay on schedule?

1047
01:10:40,339 --> 01:10:43,894
Unfortunately, I had to
miss a day for the funeral.

1048
01:10:43,929 --> 01:10:45,241
Yeah, all right.

1049
01:10:46,897 --> 01:10:49,452
Ready to lay in about a month.

1050
01:11:02,948 --> 01:11:03,948
Hey.

1051
01:11:06,814 --> 01:11:08,747
I'm really sorry, Ty.

1052
01:11:12,129 --> 01:11:13,130
How are you?

1053
01:11:14,822 --> 01:11:15,822
Been better.

1054
01:11:20,448 --> 01:11:23,555
Daddy said you're in charge now.

1055
01:11:23,589 --> 01:11:25,764
I guess for now I am, yep.

1056
01:11:28,594 --> 01:11:30,286
You'll be okay, Ty.

1057
01:11:33,116 --> 01:11:34,116
Na.

1058
01:11:34,773 --> 01:11:36,602
Na, I won't be crap.

1059
01:11:37,465 --> 01:11:40,779
The only guy who gave
me a chance is dead.

1060
01:11:40,813 --> 01:11:42,884
You'll be all right, though.

1061
01:11:44,127 --> 01:11:47,889
What you doing coming
around here anyway?

1062
01:11:47,924 --> 01:11:49,650
I came to see you.

1063
01:11:52,342 --> 01:11:55,000
Your Daddy was right, okay?

1064
01:11:55,034 --> 01:11:57,105
You're out of your
league with me.

1065
01:11:57,140 --> 01:11:59,418
Why don't you stop
messing with my head?

1066
01:11:59,453 --> 01:12:00,764
I don't need it.

1067
01:12:02,904 --> 01:12:04,699
That's not fair, Ty.

1068
01:12:06,874 --> 01:12:07,874
Fair?

1069
01:12:09,255 --> 01:12:11,879
Fair's in your life, not mine.

1070
01:12:15,400 --> 01:12:17,160
I gave you a chance.

1071
01:12:20,163 --> 01:12:21,164
All right.

1072
01:12:38,077 --> 01:12:41,218
Where the hell you been, man?

1073
01:12:41,253 --> 01:12:42,841
How do I get into this thing?

1074
01:12:42,875 --> 01:12:44,946
Oh, Daddy must have locked it.

1075
01:12:44,981 --> 01:12:45,981
All right, look.

1076
01:12:46,879 --> 01:12:47,673
Go find me a crowbar, then
let's go over everything again...

1077
01:12:47,708 --> 01:12:49,365
No, forget all that, Lurvy.

1078
01:12:49,399 --> 01:12:50,331
That's done, man.

1079
01:12:50,366 --> 01:12:51,228
What are you talking about?

1080
01:12:51,263 --> 01:12:52,126
The championship's
in two days, man.

1081
01:12:52,160 --> 01:12:53,541
What's the point, man?

1082
01:12:53,576 --> 01:12:55,543
Even if we win, which we won't,

1083
01:12:55,578 --> 01:12:57,062
we can't make it
to Phoenix City.

1084
01:12:57,096 --> 01:12:59,616
Costs money, Lurvy.

1085
01:12:59,651 --> 01:13:01,860
Fuel, hotels, crew.

1086
01:13:01,894 --> 01:13:04,034
We got none of it.

1087
01:13:04,069 --> 01:13:06,761
You got money for gas,
hotel rooms, crew?

1088
01:13:06,796 --> 01:13:07,797
Do you?

1089
01:13:07,831 --> 01:13:08,831
No.

1090
01:13:09,385 --> 01:13:10,282
Then it ain't
gonna happen, is it?

1091
01:13:10,316 --> 01:13:12,629
We ain't got the God
danged entry free.

1092
01:13:12,664 --> 01:13:14,700
Just forget it, man.

1093
01:13:14,735 --> 01:13:15,839
Listen, Ty.

1094
01:13:15,874 --> 01:13:17,462
I'm sorry about Uncle Charlie.

1095
01:13:17,496 --> 01:13:21,604
I really am, but you can't just
come in here and quit on us.

1096
01:13:22,743 --> 01:13:24,227
I'm tired, man.

1097
01:13:24,261 --> 01:13:26,022
I'm tired of trying.

1098
01:13:26,056 --> 01:13:28,852
All right, I'm done with this.

1099
01:13:28,887 --> 01:13:29,853
We're done with this.

1100
01:13:29,888 --> 01:13:31,130
Okay, fine.

1101
01:13:31,165 --> 01:13:31,786
If you can find me a key to
this thing you're gonna feel...

1102
01:13:31,821 --> 01:13:33,719
I told you it's over!

1103
01:14:27,946 --> 01:14:29,085
Try your way.

1104
01:15:07,503 --> 01:15:09,435
I'm gonna do my part.

1105
01:15:11,576 --> 01:15:15,752
Forget Phoenix city, we
could at least win locals.

1106
01:15:16,753 --> 01:15:18,386
All right, I'm just
gonna get it on out there

1107
01:15:18,410 --> 01:15:20,170
for everybody to see.

1108
01:15:20,205 --> 01:15:23,104
I don't want nobody saying
I didn't do my part.

1109
01:15:23,139 --> 01:15:25,521
I do what I say I'm gonna do.

1110
01:15:56,482 --> 01:15:58,001
Ty, excuse me.

1111
01:15:58,036 --> 01:15:59,382
Ma'am.

1112
01:15:59,416 --> 01:16:02,316
Alabama utility wants to
know if they're order is ready.

1113
01:16:02,350 --> 01:16:04,525
Yeah, it's bundled
up in the back lot.

1114
01:16:04,560 --> 01:16:05,560
Thank you.

1115
01:16:06,492 --> 01:16:09,116
Aunt Paula, you know
there's a radio inside

1116
01:16:09,150 --> 01:16:10,807
you use to call down here.

1117
01:16:10,842 --> 01:16:14,017
You don't have to
keep coming out.

1118
01:16:14,052 --> 01:16:16,468
I'll have to remember that.

1119
01:16:17,434 --> 01:16:19,920
Maybe I just wanted to get out.

1120
01:16:20,748 --> 01:16:22,957
You don't look so good.

1121
01:16:22,992 --> 01:16:25,028
I'll be all right.

1122
01:16:25,063 --> 01:16:27,134
We both will, won't we?

1123
01:16:28,445 --> 01:16:30,793
Yes, ma'am, we're just fine.

1124
01:16:31,897 --> 01:16:33,312
Thank you, Ty.

1125
01:16:50,813 --> 01:16:51,952
Hey, Ty.

1126
01:16:51,986 --> 01:16:52,986
Hey, man.

1127
01:16:53,781 --> 01:16:55,783
Hey, do you still have
the keys to this truck?

1128
01:16:55,818 --> 01:16:56,818
Yeah.

1129
01:16:57,613 --> 01:16:59,822
Cool, can I just get
them back from you.

1130
01:16:59,856 --> 01:17:01,340
I'm trying to get everything...

1131
01:17:01,375 --> 01:17:02,963
Sure, man, it's your truck.

1132
01:17:02,997 --> 01:17:05,034
I'll just grab a ride from Reed.

1133
01:17:05,068 --> 01:17:06,114
Yeah, you're done
with it, right?

1134
01:17:06,138 --> 01:17:06,967
It's yours, man.

1135
01:17:07,001 --> 01:17:07,761
Thanks.

1136
01:17:07,795 --> 01:17:09,625
All right, brother.

1137
01:17:13,421 --> 01:17:14,768
Hey, where's Ty?

1138
01:17:15,700 --> 01:17:17,494
He ain't coming.

1139
01:17:17,529 --> 01:17:18,529
What?

1140
01:17:19,807 --> 01:17:21,775
Look, you tell anybody
who asks I was here,

1141
01:17:21,809 --> 01:17:23,535
and I had it ready.

1142
01:17:23,569 --> 01:17:25,192
What happened?

1143
01:17:25,226 --> 01:17:27,953
I don't know, Sherry,
he's just messed up.

1144
01:17:27,988 --> 01:17:29,034
Look, you better go
back in the stands

1145
01:17:29,058 --> 01:17:31,750
before they close
the gate on you.

1146
01:18:07,061 --> 01:18:09,892
Your daddy said you'd be here.

1147
01:18:22,387 --> 01:18:24,458
Lurvy came by my
house before the race.

1148
01:18:24,492 --> 01:18:27,979
He's dragging that
thing out there?

1149
01:18:28,013 --> 01:18:29,049
Says he is.

1150
01:18:31,914 --> 01:18:34,986
You know he also says
you're not going.

1151
01:18:36,781 --> 01:18:37,851
That's right.

1152
01:18:38,783 --> 01:18:42,545
You know Uncle Charlie
would want you to.

1153
01:18:47,481 --> 01:18:51,796
You know, Ty, there's two
kinds of people in the world.

1154
01:18:51,830 --> 01:18:53,014
People that watch things happen,

1155
01:18:53,038 --> 01:18:56,041
and the people that
make them happen.

1156
01:18:57,905 --> 01:18:59,804
I thought that was you.

1157
01:19:02,738 --> 01:19:03,887
I thought you were
the one to say

1158
01:19:03,911 --> 01:19:05,164
to hell with the
cards I'm dealt,

1159
01:19:05,188 --> 01:19:09,261
I'm making my own way, and
anyone who wants to go with me.

1160
01:19:12,471 --> 01:19:16,717
You know my daddy's taking
me to the race tonight?

1161
01:19:19,030 --> 01:19:21,791
You even got him
believing in you.

1162
01:19:23,379 --> 01:19:25,484
What do I say to him now?

1163
01:19:55,652 --> 01:19:57,206
Ladies and
gentlemen, welcome to the

1164
01:19:57,240 --> 01:19:58,828
Deep South Speedway.

1165
01:19:58,863 --> 01:20:01,175
We're about to rock and roll
in a country sort of way,

1166
01:20:01,210 --> 01:20:04,316
and if you're lucky,
you'll get dirty.

1167
01:20:12,738 --> 01:20:15,155
And first place in the
modifiers go to Jimmy Hacker

1168
01:20:15,189 --> 01:20:16,777
out of Kansas.

1169
01:20:16,812 --> 01:20:19,297
Now ladies and gentlemen, the
even we've all come here for.

1170
01:20:19,331 --> 01:20:21,333
The street style championship,

1171
01:20:21,368 --> 01:20:22,794
but I'm sorry to
say that Ty Hargrove

1172
01:20:22,818 --> 01:20:24,854
is not in the out suit.

1173
01:20:25,648 --> 01:20:28,271
He's cutting it
awful close, isn't he?

1174
01:20:28,306 --> 01:20:29,801
Well, if you're ever looking
to join the winning team...

1175
01:20:29,825 --> 01:20:32,103
I ain't looking.

1176
01:20:32,137 --> 01:20:34,864
If you change your
mind... Son of a!

1177
01:20:34,899 --> 01:20:36,383
Hey, man, get in here.

1178
01:20:36,417 --> 01:20:37,833
You're a dead man Hargrove!

1179
01:20:37,867 --> 01:20:38,937
You're dead.

1180
01:20:38,972 --> 01:20:40,570
She said you're coming,
I didn't believe her.

1181
01:20:40,594 --> 01:20:41,457
You got it ready?

1182
01:20:41,491 --> 01:20:42,872
Hell, yeah, I got it ready.

1183
01:20:42,907 --> 01:20:44,011
Hey, remember turn one.

1184
01:20:44,046 --> 01:20:44,840
I remember.

1185
01:20:44,874 --> 01:20:46,324
Hey, I'm sorry, man.

1186
01:20:46,358 --> 01:20:47,187
It's all right, man.

1187
01:20:47,221 --> 01:20:48,221
Come on.

1188
01:20:53,365 --> 01:20:57,369
Oh, she said to give you
this when you got here.

1189
01:20:59,924 --> 01:21:01,960
Knock them dead.

1190
01:21:14,904 --> 01:21:16,184
Well, tonight's
the night, folks.

1191
01:21:16,216 --> 01:21:18,908
Defending champion Snake
Turner takes on local celebrity

1192
01:21:18,943 --> 01:21:21,877
Ty Hargrove for the
Newberry automotive cup,

1193
01:21:21,911 --> 01:21:25,777
and I take it that the state
championship in Phoenix City.

1194
01:22:19,417 --> 01:22:20,832
Snake Turner keeps the lead,

1195
01:22:20,866 --> 01:22:24,146
but Ty Hargrove's
right in his backyard.

1196
01:22:33,086 --> 01:22:34,604
Keep the pressure on him, Ty.

1197
01:22:34,639 --> 01:22:35,639
You got it.

1198
01:22:44,821 --> 01:22:46,720
Snake's.

1199
01:22:46,754 --> 01:22:48,964
Ty Hargrove takes the lead.

1200
01:22:48,998 --> 01:22:49,998
Yes!

1201
01:22:57,420 --> 01:22:59,181
And Ike Smith moves
into the second.

1202
01:22:59,215 --> 01:23:00,320
What an upset!

1203
01:23:14,817 --> 01:23:18,131
And Ty Hargrove
wins the Newberry

1204
01:23:18,165 --> 01:23:19,960
Our boy's going to state.

1205
01:23:49,127 --> 01:23:51,060
We'd like to thank y'all
for coming out tonight.

1206
01:23:51,095 --> 01:23:53,856
We got refreshments and
barbecue in the back,

1207
01:23:53,890 --> 01:23:56,479
and don't forget the
t-shirts and decals

1208
01:23:56,514 --> 01:23:58,792
with all your favorite drivers.

1209
01:23:58,826 --> 01:24:01,967
We hope you all had
a good old time.

1210
01:24:02,002 --> 01:24:03,486
Yeah, what you say, boy?

1211
01:24:06,110 --> 01:24:07,628
I love you, man.

1212
01:24:09,009 --> 01:24:13,220
You know, doctors are known
for making stupid investments.

1213
01:24:14,049 --> 01:24:15,809
I hope this isn't one.

1214
01:24:19,364 --> 01:24:20,364
Serious?

1215
01:24:21,297 --> 01:24:23,058
I guess I can trust
you with my money,

1216
01:24:23,092 --> 01:24:26,268
I can trust you
with my daughter.

1217
01:24:26,302 --> 01:24:29,961
I think you got
that backwards, but

1218
01:24:29,995 --> 01:24:32,481
I was wrong, I admit it.

1219
01:24:32,515 --> 01:24:34,793
You make us proud at state.

1220
01:24:34,828 --> 01:24:35,794
What about the pole mill?

1221
01:24:35,829 --> 01:24:37,555
It'll wait on you.

1222
01:24:38,625 --> 01:24:40,799

going to Phoenix City!

Oh, yes!

1245
01:29:37,889 --> 01:29:39,477
Yes!

1246
01:29:40,340 --> 01:29:41,479
Ty, yes!

1247
01:29:41,514 --> 01:29:42,687
You did it, man!

1248
01:29:42,722 --> 01:29:43,722
You did it!

1249
01:29:44,379 --> 01:29:45,379
Yes, yes!

1250
01:29:48,313 --> 01:29:49,313
Sherry!

1251
01:29:50,557 --> 01:29:53,595
Yeah, Snake, you like that?

1252
01:29:53,629 --> 01:29:55,873
That's how you drive.

1253
01:29:56,632 --> 01:29:57,633
Yes!

1254
01:29:59,463 --> 01:30:00,809
Too much?
