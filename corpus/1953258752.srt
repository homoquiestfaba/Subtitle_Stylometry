1
00:01:03,696 --> 00:01:07,633
- Unbelievable.
- I can't hold it much longer.

2
00:01:12,872 --> 00:01:14,639
You've almost got the record.

3
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:17,175
Come on, 20 more seconds.
Hold on tight...

4
00:01:17,176 --> 00:01:19,178
I think I'm about to pass out!

5
00:01:20,679 --> 00:01:22,748
I can't!

6
00:01:24,583 --> 00:01:26,159
Oh...

7
00:01:33,159 --> 00:01:38,763
Mm... Oh, my God!
This is so good!

8
00:01:38,764 --> 00:01:40,464
I put a little Cointreau in.

9
00:01:40,465 --> 00:01:42,433
- Mm.
- That's the secret.

10
00:01:42,434 --> 00:01:44,601
Mm. I have to
go in a minute,

11
00:01:44,602 --> 00:01:47,206
- do you want to dance?
- Yeah.

12
00:01:48,206 --> 00:01:50,875
# Just blows me away #

13
00:01:50,876 --> 00:01:53,545
# Unskinny bop, bop #

14
00:01:53,546 --> 00:01:56,181
# All night and day #

15
00:01:56,182 --> 00:01:58,815
# Unskinny bop, bop, bop #

16
00:01:58,816 --> 00:02:01,318
# She just loves to play #

17
00:02:01,319 --> 00:02:05,724
# Unskinny bop
Nothing more to say #

18
00:02:06,724 --> 00:02:09,630
# You look at me so funny #

19
00:02:11,630 --> 00:02:16,234
# Love bite got you acting
oh so strange #

20
00:02:16,235 --> 00:02:18,437
# You got too many
bees in your honey... #

21
00:02:18,438 --> 00:02:21,340
You're a fucking
hot one, ain't ya?

22
00:02:23,675 --> 00:02:26,783
Oh, I'm OK.

23
00:02:31,783 --> 00:02:35,620
Check us out.

24
00:02:35,621 --> 00:02:38,790
Can you... put that away?
You're scaring me.

25
00:02:38,791 --> 00:02:41,226
Well, you should be scared.

26
00:02:41,227 --> 00:02:44,862
It's a healthy reaction
to a big ass gun like this.

27
00:02:44,863 --> 00:02:46,834
Yeah.

28
00:02:48,834 --> 00:02:50,342
OK.

29
00:02:57,342 --> 00:03:00,845
I'm going to go now, time's up.

30
00:03:00,846 --> 00:03:03,481
I guess you've got to go.

31
00:03:03,482 --> 00:03:05,485
OK.

32
00:03:07,485 --> 00:03:09,554
I enjoyed your company!

33
00:03:09,555 --> 00:03:12,290
I hope you come back!

34
00:03:12,291 --> 00:03:13,858
Get me out of here.

35
00:03:13,859 --> 00:03:15,727
OK, Otis, we're going.

36
00:03:15,728 --> 00:03:17,773
We are going, right now.
Come on, honey.

37
00:03:27,773 --> 00:03:30,741
- Hi, Dad.
- Beth! Bethanna...

38
00:03:30,742 --> 00:03:32,844
- Hey.
- Hello.

39
00:03:32,845 --> 00:03:37,681
- OK, what's up?
- I need to do something else.

40
00:03:37,682 --> 00:03:39,518
What's wrong with
the pet sitting?

41
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:42,287
I never knew anyone who could
make so much off that.

42
00:03:42,288 --> 00:03:44,621
Yeah, the money's good,

43
00:03:44,622 --> 00:03:47,525
but the pets are not
always that nice.

44
00:03:47,526 --> 00:03:49,594
I'm burned out.

45
00:03:49,595 --> 00:03:54,031
Take it from me, now is not the
time to put down a good job.

46
00:03:54,032 --> 00:03:55,531
You still haven't
found anything?

47
00:03:55,532 --> 00:03:56,835
No, nobody's buying cars.

48
00:03:56,836 --> 00:03:58,536
Hell, they're
barely making them.

49
00:03:58,537 --> 00:04:00,871
Well, it's more
than just my job.

50
00:04:00,872 --> 00:04:03,875
I need like a big change.

51
00:04:03,876 --> 00:04:07,879
I have to, I don't know...

52
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:11,882
I want stimulation.

53
00:04:11,883 --> 00:04:13,685
And I want good money.

54
00:04:13,686 --> 00:04:18,056
And I want a change of
scenery that's interesting.

55
00:04:18,057 --> 00:04:23,594
OK... OK, let me think if I
know anybody over at the mall.

56
00:04:23,595 --> 00:04:26,931
Yeah, it's not going to do it.

57
00:04:26,932 --> 00:04:30,971
I want to move to Las Vegas
and be a cocktail waitress.

58
00:04:33,971 --> 00:04:35,975
Beth Anne...

59
00:04:36,975 --> 00:04:40,912
...goddamn,
that is a great idea!

60
00:04:40,913 --> 00:04:43,547
Wow! Yeah, Oh...
Caesars Palace.

61
00:04:43,548 --> 00:04:46,751
- That's where you got to get in!
- Caesars would be amazing!

62
00:04:46,752 --> 00:04:48,440
Oh...

63
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:45,851
- I think the hot plate works.
- I'll take it.

64
00:05:53,851 --> 00:05:57,155
Go! Go...
Oh, so close.

65
00:05:57,156 --> 00:06:00,924
Go! Yes... Oh! Oh.

66
00:06:00,925 --> 00:06:03,160
Please... Go on!

67
00:06:03,161 --> 00:06:06,031
Hey. I advise you to
stop playing this thing.

68
00:06:07,031 --> 00:06:08,697
Why? Am I in trouble
or something?

69
00:06:08,698 --> 00:06:10,500
No, no. It's just...
You seem like a nice girl,

70
00:06:10,501 --> 00:06:12,001
and flip's for retards.

71
00:06:12,004 --> 00:06:14,905
Oh... OK.

72
00:06:14,906 --> 00:06:17,741
- Thank you.
- No problem. Have a nice evening.

73
00:06:17,742 --> 00:06:19,710
Hey, wait.

74
00:06:19,711 --> 00:06:23,513
Do you know where I could find
a job as a cocktail waitress?

75
00:06:23,514 --> 00:06:25,549
I think you pretty much
have to grab the tray

76
00:06:25,550 --> 00:06:28,085
the exact second one of these
golden girls kicks the bucket.

77
00:06:28,086 --> 00:06:29,653
This is a union town.

78
00:06:29,654 --> 00:06:31,222
Take it easy.

79
00:06:31,223 --> 00:06:33,995
Huh.

80
00:06:45,771 --> 00:06:49,106
Why don't you strip?
It's good money.

81
00:06:49,107 --> 00:06:51,076
Yeah, I don't think
I want to do that.

82
00:06:51,077 --> 00:06:52,943
You've done it before, right?

83
00:06:52,944 --> 00:06:54,912
Why do you say that?

84
00:06:54,913 --> 00:06:57,582
- 'Cause it's kind of obvious.
- It is? Really?

85
00:06:57,583 --> 00:07:01,622
Just to us girls in the club.

86
00:07:03,622 --> 00:07:06,756
I just want to do something
exciting and different.

87
00:07:06,757 --> 00:07:09,093
- I came here to...
- Yeah, change everything.

88
00:07:09,094 --> 00:07:11,261
Hey, Holly, what about Dink?

89
00:07:11,262 --> 00:07:14,832
- What's Dink?
- Doesn't he need anybody?

90
00:07:14,833 --> 00:07:16,200
Well, that's kind of...

91
00:07:16,201 --> 00:07:17,935
You know, I kind of
need to know someone

92
00:07:17,936 --> 00:07:20,071
before I send them to Dink.

93
00:07:20,072 --> 00:07:22,739
It requires a great deal
of trustworthiness.

94
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:26,677
Oh, my God, you guys...
I am super trustworthy.

95
00:07:26,678 --> 00:07:28,990
All right.

96
00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:40,657
- Hi.
- Hi. Are you Dink?

97
00:07:40,658 --> 00:07:44,932
I am Dink, yes.
You must be Beth. Come in.

98
00:07:46,932 --> 00:07:49,066
So, how much do you
know about gambling?

99
00:07:49,067 --> 00:07:51,936
Uh, I played some
Flip-It the other night...

100
00:07:51,937 --> 00:07:53,638
How'd you do?

101
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:54,837
I was told it was for retards,

102
00:07:54,838 --> 00:07:56,338
but I got really into it.

103
00:07:57,576 --> 00:07:59,609
I might not trust you
with my money.

104
00:07:59,610 --> 00:08:01,178
You're going to rob me and
go play Flip-It all night.

105
00:08:01,179 --> 00:08:03,114
No, no, I'm not.

106
00:08:03,115 --> 00:08:06,583
Come on, I need this Louisiana
game to stay under...

107
00:08:06,584 --> 00:08:10,054
- Not for a little.
- So, you're a bookie.

108
00:08:10,055 --> 00:08:13,323
Absolutely not.
Bookmaking's illegal.

109
00:08:13,324 --> 00:08:15,859
I'm a gambler.
Everything I do here

110
00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:17,726
is completely legal
in the state of Nevada.

111
00:08:17,727 --> 00:08:19,197
So, do you play
poker or blackjack?

112
00:08:19,198 --> 00:08:23,301
Some poker... blackjack,
not really gambling.

113
00:08:23,302 --> 00:08:25,169
It's just no skill, no odds.

114
00:08:25,170 --> 00:08:27,072
Just a racket for the
casinos to make money.

115
00:08:27,073 --> 00:08:29,273
Well, my dad played
a lot of blackjack.

116
00:08:29,274 --> 00:08:31,075
Sorry to hear that.

117
00:08:31,076 --> 00:08:33,744
Ah, this San Francisco
line is way too high.

118
00:08:33,745 --> 00:08:36,647
Look at something.

119
00:08:36,648 --> 00:08:38,082
You see that little patch
of yellow skin right there?

120
00:08:38,083 --> 00:08:40,585
- Nope.
- Well, maybe not in this light.

121
00:08:40,586 --> 00:08:43,988
Anyway, I make my lines. Then
I compare them to the books.

122
00:08:43,989 --> 00:08:46,691
- To the books?
- Sports books.

123
00:08:46,692 --> 00:08:49,994
A sports book is where you go to
make a bet on a sporting game.

124
00:08:49,995 --> 00:08:51,796
You can do that here in Vegas,

125
00:08:51,797 --> 00:08:54,166
or you can do it online overseas,
but I gotta do it here.

126
00:08:54,167 --> 00:08:56,801
So, I gotta send guys
that run and take the

127
00:08:56,802 --> 00:08:58,802
money down there and
make the bets for me.

128
00:08:58,803 --> 00:09:01,072
Maybe that's something you could
do, if you come down here to work.

129
00:09:01,073 --> 00:09:05,075
I can't believe you can't see
this little yellow mark.

130
00:09:05,076 --> 00:09:08,379
So, I specialize
in horse racing,

131
00:09:08,380 --> 00:09:11,215
hockey and baseball, but
we bet on all sports here.

132
00:09:11,216 --> 00:09:14,250
- Can I?
- NFL, NBA, the PGA,

133
00:09:14,251 --> 00:09:17,354
NCAA Football, NCAA Basketball,

134
00:09:17,355 --> 00:09:20,725
tennis, the WNBA,

135
00:09:20,726 --> 00:09:22,193
Little League World Series,

136
00:09:22,194 --> 00:09:24,228
the National Spelling
Bee Competition,

137
00:09:24,229 --> 00:09:26,096
the Miss America Beauty Pageant,

138
00:09:26,097 --> 00:09:29,200
the... Coney Island
Hot Dog Eating Contest.

139
00:09:29,201 --> 00:09:33,269
Pretty much anything,
always odds can be made.

140
00:09:33,270 --> 00:09:36,106
That is a lot of stuff.

141
00:09:36,107 --> 00:09:40,978
Yes, but all I have to do is make 55
percent, and I am very, very happy.

142
00:09:40,979 --> 00:09:44,981
It's about time!

143
00:09:44,982 --> 00:09:47,752
- You're both late.
- Construction!

144
00:09:47,753 --> 00:09:50,921
- Hi...
- Beth, say hi to Frankie and Scott.

145
00:09:50,922 --> 00:09:53,257
Hey, do not fall
in love with me.

146
00:09:53,258 --> 00:09:55,226
- OK.
- - Don't believe a word he says.

147
00:09:55,227 --> 00:09:58,129
Frankie is a much better
person than he seems.

148
00:09:58,130 --> 00:10:00,263
Scott, on the other hand,
is the sensible one.

149
00:10:00,264 --> 00:10:03,970
If you ever need me for
something and I'm busy?

150
00:10:04,970 --> 00:10:07,204
I'm going to bet
this seven horse.

151
00:10:07,205 --> 00:10:11,341
First time starter.
Could be a total zero.

152
00:10:11,342 --> 00:10:13,077
- New York's moving big time.
- Call Jazz.

153
00:10:13,078 --> 00:10:14,945
I wish you guys weren't late...

154
00:10:14,946 --> 00:10:16,380
One-six-four
Ivy sixth race...

155
00:10:30,162 --> 00:10:32,763
OK, here's what just
happened in New York.

156
00:10:32,764 --> 00:10:35,832
They're moving their line, so now we're
trying to move our lines accordingly

157
00:10:35,833 --> 00:10:37,969
to adjust for a couple of outs that
haven't moved their lines yet.

158
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:39,936
- You understand?
- Uh-uh.

159
00:10:39,937 --> 00:10:42,138
The rules at Dink Inc.
are responsibility

160
00:10:42,139 --> 00:10:44,074
to come on time is
job is number one.

161
00:10:44,075 --> 00:10:46,041
Number two, keep your
head around the numbers.

162
00:10:46,042 --> 00:10:47,379
You've got to
learn the numbers.

163
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:49,747
Very important to
get the numbers down.

164
00:10:49,748 --> 00:10:51,415
Rule number three,
do not steal.

165
00:10:51,416 --> 00:10:54,284
Most people fail
at one of those.

166
00:10:54,285 --> 00:10:57,922
- Is that a guinea pig?
- That is my hamster, Jyrki.

167
00:10:57,923 --> 00:10:59,290
I named him Jyrki Lumme

168
00:10:59,291 --> 00:11:01,725
after the defenseman
from Vancouver Canucks.

169
00:11:01,726 --> 00:11:04,295
- Oh.
- And that is my wife, Tulip.

170
00:11:04,296 --> 00:11:06,497
She's on a cruise in
the Bahamas right now.

171
00:11:06,498 --> 00:11:10,167
Dinky, Dinky. This nag you
bet on is coming up fast!

172
00:11:10,168 --> 00:11:13,436
- Go, go, go...
- - Wow, wow, wow...

173
00:11:13,437 --> 00:11:17,109
Come on! Come on...

174
00:11:32,323 --> 00:11:34,992
You won!

175
00:11:34,993 --> 00:11:37,161
- You won!
- Genius.

176
00:11:37,162 --> 00:11:40,531
Just like that. Wow.

177
00:11:40,532 --> 00:11:42,899
I have to pay
attention to this now.

178
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:46,537
Um, meet me at the
sports book at the Rio.

179
00:11:46,538 --> 00:11:48,373
Eight AM sharp, OK?
Do you need some money?

180
00:11:48,374 --> 00:11:49,874
- No.
- Everybody needs money.

181
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:52,549
Take it. OK? Bye.

182
00:11:58,549 --> 00:12:00,057
- Thank you.
- Yeah, take it easy.

183
00:12:07,057 --> 00:12:09,326
You're lucky if
Dinky hires you.

184
00:12:09,327 --> 00:12:11,095
He's a good guy to work for.

185
00:12:11,096 --> 00:12:14,398
He buys his crew
breakfast and lunch.

186
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:18,903
And how does a girl like you
get along with Dinky's wife?

187
00:12:18,904 --> 00:12:20,237
I haven't met her yet.

188
00:12:20,238 --> 00:12:22,406
- Is that right?
- - Hey, Dinky!

189
00:12:22,407 --> 00:12:26,210
There she is! I thought I
scared you off yesterday.

190
00:12:26,211 --> 00:12:28,479
Hey, I know you.
It's the Flip-It girl.

191
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:30,447
Oh, no. You're not
still playing Flip-It?

192
00:12:30,448 --> 00:12:33,350
- No.
- Just do me a favor, go into the counter...

193
00:12:33,351 --> 00:12:36,887
Belmont, race two. 50 dollars
quinella on the five and seven.

194
00:12:36,888 --> 00:12:38,557
- And keep this for yourself.
- Oh no, I'll do it for free.

195
00:12:38,558 --> 00:12:40,590
- I need to learn.
- Take the money.

196
00:12:40,591 --> 00:12:44,228
He's on a roll.
You're struggling.

197
00:12:44,229 --> 00:12:47,933
Take the money. Come on,
I'll walk you up there.

198
00:12:48,933 --> 00:12:50,102
So...

199
00:12:52,102 --> 00:12:53,871
...when someone
gives you their money,

200
00:12:53,872 --> 00:12:56,008
it's a... a sign of trust.

201
00:12:57,008 --> 00:12:58,275
You understand that, don't you?

202
00:12:58,276 --> 00:13:00,210
Yeah, I understand.

203
00:13:00,211 --> 00:13:03,047
Belmont, race two.

204
00:13:03,048 --> 00:13:05,620
Fifty dollar quinella
for the five and the seven.

205
00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:11,321
What?
I'm good with numbers.

206
00:13:11,322 --> 00:13:12,623
Hm.

207
00:13:12,624 --> 00:13:15,091
All these sports,

208
00:13:15,092 --> 00:13:20,096
hockey, racing, football,
basketball, whatever.

209
00:13:20,097 --> 00:13:24,969
Over there on the board are the lines
the casino is offering. The odds.

210
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:28,504
You can bet on anything.
Who wins, who wins by how much.

211
00:13:28,505 --> 00:13:32,942
The team with the best finish.
Anything. Look, see?

212
00:13:32,943 --> 00:13:37,480
Someone's laying a lot of money,
so the casino's changing the odds.

213
00:13:37,481 --> 00:13:41,118
I make my money by working
out where they're wrong.

214
00:13:41,119 --> 00:13:46,523
God, that was so exciting! And the
money, you won so much money!

215
00:13:46,524 --> 00:13:49,960
I had a bad day yesterday.
The money's not that important.

216
00:13:49,961 --> 00:13:51,029
Oh, well, that's what people
with money love to say.

217
00:13:52,029 --> 00:13:53,463
You are good with numbers.

218
00:13:53,464 --> 00:13:55,066
Yeah, I'm pretty good
with letters, too.

219
00:13:55,067 --> 00:13:57,066
- What?
- Say a word.

220
00:13:57,067 --> 00:13:59,538
- Lose.
- No, a long one.

221
00:14:00,538 --> 00:14:03,407
Louisiana.

222
00:14:03,408 --> 00:14:05,475
Double A, double I,
L, N, O with U.

223
00:14:05,476 --> 00:14:07,913
- I don't get it.
- It's the letters of Louisiana,

224
00:14:07,914 --> 00:14:09,647
put in alphabetical order.

225
00:14:09,648 --> 00:14:11,949
- I know, it's weird, right?
- Do it again.

226
00:14:11,950 --> 00:14:14,051
Well, give me a word.

227
00:14:14,052 --> 00:14:18,024
- Suicide.
- C, D, E, double I, S, U.

228
00:14:19,024 --> 00:14:22,229
That was amazing.

229
00:14:24,229 --> 00:14:27,630
So, after Ohio,
I moved back to Florida again,

230
00:14:27,631 --> 00:14:31,234
where my dad lives. And I got
a job in a Thai restaurant,

231
00:14:31,235 --> 00:14:35,573
but when I broke up with
their son, they fired me.

232
00:14:36,573 --> 00:14:39,379
- OK.
- OK.

233
00:14:41,379 --> 00:14:43,216
What?

234
00:14:45,216 --> 00:14:50,053
OK, so after I got fired,
I had to find another job.

235
00:14:50,054 --> 00:14:52,956
And I found one in the paper.

236
00:14:52,957 --> 00:14:55,058
And, it was...

237
00:14:55,059 --> 00:14:57,360
...private dancing.

238
00:14:57,361 --> 00:15:00,730
You know, going to clients
houses and stripping.

239
00:15:00,731 --> 00:15:04,201
- Basically.
- OK.

240
00:15:04,202 --> 00:15:05,969
And then also I had
a pornographic website,

241
00:15:05,970 --> 00:15:07,436
which was pictures of me naked,

242
00:15:07,437 --> 00:15:09,206
Photoshopped to look
like I was giving oral sex

243
00:15:09,207 --> 00:15:11,475
to my twin and stuff.

244
00:15:11,476 --> 00:15:14,744
Eventually, a few other
girls joined it, too.

245
00:15:14,745 --> 00:15:17,380
Nobody knows about that.

246
00:15:17,381 --> 00:15:21,250
- Nobody.
- You're a gonif.

247
00:15:21,251 --> 00:15:25,288
Gonif. Yiddish for a
small time loveable thief.

248
00:15:25,289 --> 00:15:27,992
You'll do very well
in this business.

249
00:15:27,993 --> 00:15:30,061
Well, you don't think it's
something I should be ashamed of?

250
00:15:30,062 --> 00:15:31,461
No, no. You're a kid.

251
00:15:31,462 --> 00:15:34,465
You're just doing kid things.

252
00:15:34,466 --> 00:15:36,768
I mean, it's dangerous.
Not that happy about that.

253
00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:38,634
If my parents ever found out,

254
00:15:38,635 --> 00:15:41,471
they would feel like they
have no idea who I really am.

255
00:15:41,472 --> 00:15:45,308
I freebased a couple of times.

256
00:15:45,309 --> 00:15:47,444
I never told my mom.

257
00:15:47,445 --> 00:15:49,779
I was a bookie,
back in New York.

258
00:15:49,780 --> 00:15:52,018
Harmless, but illegal.

259
00:15:53,018 --> 00:15:56,253
As it turns out, I took some
bets from this guy in Detroit.

260
00:15:56,254 --> 00:15:59,489
I never met him,
turns out he's a mob guy.

261
00:15:59,490 --> 00:16:01,493
When they bust him, they go
through his phone records.

262
00:16:01,494 --> 00:16:04,661
- They end up busting me.
- Did you go to jail?

263
00:16:04,662 --> 00:16:08,297
No, a felony conviction, but I
was only in a halfway house.

264
00:16:08,298 --> 00:16:11,402
But my mom was devastated.

265
00:16:11,403 --> 00:16:14,707
At least she never thought
she had no idea who I am.

266
00:16:16,707 --> 00:16:18,776
- OK?
- OK.

267
00:16:18,777 --> 00:16:21,412
- OK, then.
- Oh, OK. Bye.

268
00:16:21,413 --> 00:16:23,247
OK, bye.

269
00:16:23,248 --> 00:16:27,518
All right, see you
in the morning.

270
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:31,154
- Don't be late.
- Wait! Are you hiring me?

271
00:16:31,155 --> 00:16:34,792
- Still want the job?
- Yes! I want the job.

272
00:16:34,793 --> 00:16:36,427
Then yes, I'm hiring you.

273
00:16:36,428 --> 00:16:38,262
Hours are from 8 to 5,

274
00:16:38,263 --> 00:16:40,330
you get four hours
off for lunch, 10 to 2,

275
00:16:40,331 --> 00:16:43,633
Monday through Saturday,
Sundays we go all day, 8 to 4.

276
00:16:43,634 --> 00:16:45,235
You get paid
20 dollars an hour...

277
00:16:45,236 --> 00:16:47,571
- Really?
- ...Bonuses, vacations.

278
00:16:47,572 --> 00:16:49,672
- Yes. And three meals.
- Really?

279
00:16:49,673 --> 00:16:52,109
Oh, my God, yes, really.

280
00:16:52,110 --> 00:16:54,380
Bye.

281
00:17:01,285 --> 00:17:03,288
- OK.
- - All right, I'll call you back in 10.

282
00:17:03,289 --> 00:17:06,289
Oh shit, shit's popping off!
Let's get ready to rumble!

283
00:17:06,290 --> 00:17:09,393
OK, there's my
Minnesota, minus six.

284
00:17:09,394 --> 00:17:11,728
Are you ready for
this, sweet thing?

285
00:17:11,729 --> 00:17:14,097
- No, I don't get it.
- You don't get what?

286
00:17:14,098 --> 00:17:16,666
This! All of it! How to do it.
You should fire me.

287
00:17:16,667 --> 00:17:18,768
- No.
- Dink, Dink, Dink. Let me fire her.

288
00:17:18,769 --> 00:17:21,270
I'm not going to fire you, OK?

289
00:17:21,271 --> 00:17:24,274
I've just been talking to you too
much and you're mired in theory.

290
00:17:24,275 --> 00:17:26,478
OK, here's what we're gonna do.
You are gonna make this bet.

291
00:17:26,479 --> 00:17:28,644
Just use your phone,
pick it up. OK?

292
00:17:28,645 --> 00:17:30,714
- We're gonna call...
- Try Top of the World, they're slow.

293
00:17:30,715 --> 00:17:33,483
That's your speed dial for Top of the
World, you're going to call them.

294
00:17:33,484 --> 00:17:35,786
It's a sports book
in Costa Rica.

295
00:17:35,787 --> 00:17:38,721
Ask about Minnesota game, 224.

296
00:17:38,722 --> 00:17:41,624
You lay the minus six,
but two dimes.

297
00:17:41,625 --> 00:17:45,828
OK, hi. Six, four, six,
double D.

298
00:17:45,829 --> 00:17:49,298
Uh, game 224, Minnesota.

299
00:17:49,299 --> 00:17:52,335
OK, I'll take the
six with Minnesota.

300
00:17:52,336 --> 00:17:54,337
- No, no, don't...
- What? What...

301
00:17:54,338 --> 00:17:57,240
Don't say take. You're doing great.
You're doing great, OK?

302
00:17:57,241 --> 00:18:00,677
Minnesota is the favorite, you don't
take the favorite, you lay the favorite.

303
00:18:00,678 --> 00:18:04,347
OK, so we're going
to lay two dimes.

304
00:18:04,348 --> 00:18:08,820
Hi. Actually, can I lay
the six for two dime?

305
00:18:09,820 --> 00:18:13,624
Uh-huh. Six, four,
six, double D.

306
00:18:13,625 --> 00:18:16,628
OK, OK.
Watch, now watch this.

307
00:18:17,628 --> 00:18:19,662
Wait... Wait...

308
00:18:19,663 --> 00:18:22,199
You see that?
Wait for it.

309
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:24,334
- And, boom.
- What?

310
00:18:24,335 --> 00:18:26,304
- You just changed that line.
- I did?

311
00:18:26,305 --> 00:18:28,572
Our $2000 bet just
moved those odds.

312
00:18:28,573 --> 00:18:31,275
And that's what we did, OK?
You just made your first bet.

313
00:18:31,276 --> 00:18:34,945
- For $2000?
- $2000.

314
00:18:36,713 --> 00:18:40,816
The way the numbers keep
changing on the screen.

315
00:18:40,817 --> 00:18:43,487
You just make it into
what you want it to be.

316
00:18:43,488 --> 00:18:46,323
I don't know, it's the
first place that's ever

317
00:18:46,324 --> 00:18:48,825
made any sense of
how my brain works.

318
00:18:48,826 --> 00:18:51,728
Well, next thing you know he'll be
taking you to Magic's for game day.

319
00:18:51,729 --> 00:18:53,797
We're going there on Sunday.

320
00:18:53,798 --> 00:18:56,237
He asked the guys.
They couldn't come.

321
00:18:59,237 --> 00:19:00,704
- Hey, you're not...
- What?

322
00:19:00,705 --> 00:19:02,806
Are you?

323
00:19:02,807 --> 00:19:05,776
God, no.

324
00:19:05,777 --> 00:19:07,746
Mm-hm.

325
00:19:08,746 --> 00:19:10,314
All right.

326
00:19:10,315 --> 00:19:11,882
'Cause I wouldn't
if I were you.

327
00:19:11,883 --> 00:19:14,851
If you last long
enough to meet Tulip,

328
00:19:14,852 --> 00:19:16,688
- you'll know what I mean.
- Well, I'm not.

329
00:19:16,689 --> 00:19:19,456
The thought never
entered my mind.

330
00:19:19,457 --> 00:19:21,525
Mm-hm.

331
00:19:21,526 --> 00:19:23,760
Dominic kicks...

332
00:19:28,499 --> 00:19:30,767
- Hey, Dink!
- - Dinky!

333
00:19:30,768 --> 00:19:32,903
Everybody meet Beth.

334
00:19:32,904 --> 00:19:35,271
Dink Inc's newest employee

335
00:19:35,272 --> 00:19:38,408
and Flip-It aficionado.
Say hi to everybody.

336
00:19:38,409 --> 00:19:40,445
Hi.

337
00:19:41,445 --> 00:19:43,280
I don't think your
friends like me.

338
00:19:43,281 --> 00:19:45,515
They like you.

339
00:19:45,516 --> 00:19:46,916
They like you.

340
00:19:46,917 --> 00:19:48,551
They can just barely
tolerate women.

341
00:19:48,552 --> 00:19:50,385
- Forgot about that.
- I got too much on the under.

342
00:19:50,386 --> 00:19:52,622
- Anybody want a piece of this?
- I'll take two dimes.

343
00:19:52,623 --> 00:19:54,026
- Done.
- How the fuck you got two dimes to bet on the game

344
00:19:55,026 --> 00:19:57,729
when you ain't paid me back the
money from Saratoga, you fat fuck.

345
00:20:00,765 --> 00:20:03,333
Dinky! I'm back!

346
00:20:03,334 --> 00:20:05,501
- Uh-oh.
- Who is that?

347
00:20:05,502 --> 00:20:08,505
Rosie, the bookmaker
from New York.

348
00:20:08,506 --> 00:20:10,039
I thought that was illegal.

349
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:12,808
It is. Last year,
he went on a big broke.

350
00:20:12,809 --> 00:20:15,345
I mean, I can't believe he'd
show his face here, broke.

351
00:20:15,346 --> 00:20:17,581
Still owes me 70 grand.

352
00:20:17,582 --> 00:20:19,316
Aren't you mad at him?

353
00:20:19,317 --> 00:20:20,851
No, it's not
that kind of thing.

354
00:20:20,852 --> 00:20:23,393
Oh...

355
00:20:28,393 --> 00:20:30,326
I believe this is yours.

356
00:20:30,327 --> 00:20:32,562
Me handing over to you,
now that is a switch.

357
00:20:32,563 --> 00:20:34,731
Are you trying to tell me
I didn't beat you on Charlotte?

358
00:20:34,732 --> 00:20:38,335
- Fair and square, Dink.
- Fair and square.

359
00:20:38,336 --> 00:20:40,770
Wow. Can you put
this in your bag?

360
00:20:40,771 --> 00:20:43,373
I just don't have enough room in
my pockets for all that money.

361
00:20:43,374 --> 00:20:44,908
Dinky...

362
00:20:44,909 --> 00:20:46,577
Did you know this man
is one of my heroes?

363
00:20:46,578 --> 00:20:49,746
When I was 16 I wanted to
be Dink when I grew up.

364
00:20:49,747 --> 00:20:52,048
A real classic thing...
What the fuck is that?

365
00:20:52,049 --> 00:20:53,950
Is that a fucking ticker?

366
00:20:53,951 --> 00:20:56,752
Holy shit! They still
have that service?

367
00:20:56,753 --> 00:20:59,355
What is there a fucking mouse on
a treadmill inside that thing?

368
00:20:59,356 --> 00:21:01,857
It gives you the latest
scores from when? 1997?

369
00:21:01,858 --> 00:21:04,628
Still works for me.

370
00:21:12,670 --> 00:21:14,970
I just won $114,000!

371
00:21:14,971 --> 00:21:17,711
Oh, fuck you, Rosie.

372
00:21:19,711 --> 00:21:22,412
Dinky, I had to
change my phone number.

373
00:21:22,413 --> 00:21:24,514
This is my recent contact info.

374
00:21:24,515 --> 00:21:27,918
My name is Troy Roseland,
you get to call me Rosie.

375
00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:30,653
- Hi, I'm Beth.
- She works for me.

376
00:21:30,654 --> 00:21:32,365
It's great seeing you, Dink.

377
00:21:43,968 --> 00:21:48,805
Oh, hi... I'm Beth.

378
00:21:48,806 --> 00:21:51,674
- You're Beth.
- Mm-hm.

379
00:21:51,675 --> 00:21:53,012
Oh.

380
00:21:56,012 --> 00:21:58,848
Did you have a nice time
on your boating trip?

381
00:21:58,849 --> 00:22:01,050
Yes, yes. Beautiful.

382
00:22:01,051 --> 00:22:03,586
Beautiful.

383
00:22:03,587 --> 00:22:05,955
- So, who've you worked for?
- Oh, you mean where have I...

384
00:22:05,956 --> 00:22:07,724
Have you ever
worked for a gambler?

385
00:22:07,725 --> 00:22:10,727
No, no... but I'm loving
working for your husband.

386
00:22:10,728 --> 00:22:12,929
He's so great,
honest, wonderful.

387
00:22:12,930 --> 00:22:16,432
- Wonderful boss.
- So, who've you called so far for rundowns?

388
00:22:16,433 --> 00:22:18,403
- Oh...
- That is the first thing you do

389
00:22:18,404 --> 00:22:20,477
when you get to the office.

390
00:22:28,179 --> 00:22:30,180
Um, minus two.

391
00:22:30,181 --> 00:22:32,949
- There's nothing for me.
- No, Knox's line was better.

392
00:22:32,950 --> 00:22:34,816
- I'll call him back.
- Forget it. We missed it.

393
00:22:34,817 --> 00:22:36,654
We're already
on the other side.

394
00:22:36,655 --> 00:22:40,431
I'm down $50,000 today.

395
00:22:46,431 --> 00:22:48,498
You! Park it!

396
00:22:48,499 --> 00:22:50,803
No more scores.

397
00:22:51,803 --> 00:22:53,702
And that goes for you, too!

398
00:22:53,703 --> 00:22:57,179
You stay put! I mean, both of
youse just stay put, you hear me?

399
00:23:01,179 --> 00:23:02,979
Oh, no...

400
00:23:02,980 --> 00:23:05,582
No!

401
00:23:05,583 --> 00:23:08,050
Oh, touchdown, Dinky.
Twenty-nine seconds...

402
00:23:08,051 --> 00:23:11,654
Oh, perfect!

403
00:23:11,655 --> 00:23:13,656
- Tulip! You're a jinx!
- No, I'm not.

404
00:23:13,657 --> 00:23:15,625
Either you're a jinx,
or God hates me.

405
00:23:15,626 --> 00:23:18,728
You tell me which one it is.

406
00:23:18,729 --> 00:23:20,730
Would you turn that thing off?

407
00:23:25,502 --> 00:23:27,005
I'm gonna go broke this winter,
we're gonna have to sell a house.

408
00:23:28,005 --> 00:23:32,576
- You say that every winter.
- Yeah, this year I know. We are gonna go broke.

409
00:23:32,577 --> 00:23:35,479
And it's gonna sneak up on
us quietly, very quietly!

410
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:37,814
You know what?
I didn't come here for this.

411
00:23:37,815 --> 00:23:41,998
I'm going to fit in some Pilates before golf.
I didn't come here for this.

412
00:23:53,998 --> 00:23:55,000
I know something that'll
make you feel better.

413
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,768
- A bullet?
- No.

414
00:23:58,769 --> 00:24:00,903
Chinese poker.

415
00:24:00,904 --> 00:24:02,007
I haven't been doing
very good lately.

416
00:24:03,007 --> 00:24:06,776
Oh, come on. You're just
having a little moment.

417
00:24:06,777 --> 00:24:09,613
A slump. It's called a slump
and it's not getting any better.

418
00:24:09,614 --> 00:24:13,922
And it doesn't help to
have a wife who's a jinx.

419
00:24:17,922 --> 00:24:19,602
I deal with it as best I can.

420
00:24:31,602 --> 00:24:34,137
Oh, this is good, this is good.
We need this field goal.

421
00:24:36,606 --> 00:24:39,643
Hughes did very good in the first half.
Sit right here.

422
00:24:39,644 --> 00:24:42,278
Oh, I did very well just now.

423
00:24:42,279 --> 00:24:46,316
So, why didn't you go into the
stock market or something?

424
00:24:46,317 --> 00:24:48,817
- It seems like the same thing.
- Stock market's a racket,

425
00:24:48,818 --> 00:24:50,854
and I'd rather bet on
professional wrestling.

426
00:24:50,855 --> 00:24:54,723
So, why don't you have your
own sports book somewhere?

427
00:24:54,724 --> 00:24:58,627
The operators in Costa Rica sound
so nice and happy on the phone.

428
00:24:58,628 --> 00:25:00,064
I bet it's beautiful
down there.

429
00:25:00,065 --> 00:25:02,000
I went down to
San Jose one time.

430
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,568
It's not what you think when
you think of Costa Rica.

431
00:25:05,569 --> 00:25:07,202
Very grim, very sad.

432
00:25:07,203 --> 00:25:09,271
But you'd make so much
money from your own book.

433
00:25:09,272 --> 00:25:12,675
Sure, yeah, but then I'd
have to live in San Jose.

434
00:25:12,676 --> 00:25:14,678
You know, I could be
a lot richer in general

435
00:25:14,679 --> 00:25:18,047
if I'd made most of my
decisions based on money.

436
00:25:18,048 --> 00:25:19,848
My hugest defect.

437
00:25:19,849 --> 00:25:25,960
No! No! That's what
makes you so... great.

438
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:31,060
I'm not so great.

439
00:25:31,061 --> 00:25:34,698
- You what now?
- It was just hands!

440
00:25:34,699 --> 00:25:38,101
With Dink? Are you
out of your mind?

441
00:25:38,102 --> 00:25:42,037
God, I'm sorry I ever told you.

442
00:25:42,038 --> 00:25:44,140
That's what you're sorry for?

443
00:25:44,141 --> 00:25:47,043
Do you think I should
confess my love

444
00:25:47,044 --> 00:25:49,778
and see if he'll leave Tulip
and run away with me?

445
00:25:49,779 --> 00:25:53,048
Do you have some kind of
fucked up thing with your dad?

446
00:25:53,049 --> 00:25:56,720
No! God, my dad
was my best friend.

447
00:25:56,721 --> 00:26:02,158
- We did everything together.
- Can you do me a favor?

448
00:26:02,159 --> 00:26:06,329
Can you make sure Tulip never finds
out it was me who brought you around?

449
00:26:11,935 --> 00:26:14,375
- Yes! Go!
- - Go, Berto!

450
00:26:17,375 --> 00:26:19,742
I can't believe you
picked this Berto fight.

451
00:26:19,743 --> 00:26:23,212
Oh, come on!
He is a stallion.

452
00:26:23,213 --> 00:26:27,020
How could anyone lay odds on him
being out by the fifth round.

453
00:26:30,020 --> 00:26:34,156
Plus, he trains around
the corner from my motel.

454
00:26:34,157 --> 00:26:38,127
You could be my new
downtown sports consultant.

455
00:26:38,128 --> 00:26:41,798
Sure, if you want me to.

456
00:26:54,377 --> 00:26:56,445
Hi.

457
00:26:56,446 --> 00:27:00,416
You have no fucking reason
to be out so late with her!

458
00:27:00,417 --> 00:27:02,884
Tulip, every night you go
to bed at nine o'clock.

459
00:27:02,885 --> 00:27:04,422
Now, just because
I have a new friend,

460
00:27:04,423 --> 00:27:08,091
you're going to call me
up and... tell me...

461
00:27:08,092 --> 00:27:09,893
You're making yourself crazy!

462
00:27:09,894 --> 00:27:11,862
Come on, you're missing the
best part. Hang up on her.

463
00:27:11,863 --> 00:27:14,831
Did I just hear
that little cunt?!

464
00:27:14,832 --> 00:27:17,333
Tulip, you're
forcing yourself...

465
00:27:17,334 --> 00:27:20,481
Fuck you, Dink!

466
00:27:31,481 --> 00:27:33,783
I have to go home now.

467
00:27:33,784 --> 00:27:36,152
She's losing her mind.

468
00:27:36,153 --> 00:27:37,853
Just don't tell me
who wins this fight, OK?

469
00:27:37,854 --> 00:27:40,257
No, come on. No, no, no. Come on.
Stay for one more round.

470
00:27:40,258 --> 00:27:42,991
One more round.
She'll live.

471
00:27:42,992 --> 00:27:47,230
Plus, I'm making you money.

472
00:27:52,269 --> 00:27:55,838
I owe this guy Leon
down in Costa Rica, $80,000.

473
00:27:55,839 --> 00:28:00,210
You're going to take this over to
a guy named Rudy at the Paris.

474
00:28:00,211 --> 00:28:05,219
Take this to him and I'll be even with Leon.
It's $80,000. Count it.

475
00:28:08,219 --> 00:28:10,987
...And then
race fourteen...

476
00:28:10,988 --> 00:28:12,955
No, no, make Frankie do the run.
We need Beth on the phones.

477
00:28:12,956 --> 00:28:14,525
Oh what? Now Beth's better
than me on the phones?

478
00:28:14,526 --> 00:28:16,191
Well, you said that, not me.

479
00:28:16,192 --> 00:28:19,229
Now go fuck yourself, OK?
I never liked you.

480
00:28:19,230 --> 00:28:23,232
It's OK, Dink.
I'll make the run.

481
00:28:23,233 --> 00:28:25,934
Oh, for God's sake.
Stop sniffing money.

482
00:28:25,935 --> 00:28:28,509
Jesus, I can't take this.

483
00:28:40,984 --> 00:28:44,453
I'm gonna go work out
a little later,

484
00:28:44,454 --> 00:28:47,356
and then I'm going to
go home and get a massage.

485
00:28:47,357 --> 00:28:50,893
Uh, after you make this drop, you wanna
meet me over at Caesars parking lot?

486
00:28:50,894 --> 00:28:52,495
Go get something to eat?

487
00:28:52,496 --> 00:28:55,611
Uh-huh, sure.

488
00:29:40,611 --> 00:29:42,211
I love you.

489
00:29:42,212 --> 00:29:44,380
Oh...

490
00:29:44,381 --> 00:29:47,049
So, what?

491
00:29:47,050 --> 00:29:49,853
Never stopped anybody.

492
00:29:49,854 --> 00:29:52,357
We had a deal.

493
00:29:54,357 --> 00:29:56,497
We had a deal.

494
00:30:00,497 --> 00:30:03,869
I can't believe
I have to say this.

495
00:30:05,869 --> 00:30:08,971
All I was supposed to
do is take care of you.

496
00:30:08,972 --> 00:30:12,345
And you take care of me.

497
00:30:14,345 --> 00:30:17,215
That's why I picked you.

498
00:30:19,215 --> 00:30:22,624
That was our deal.

499
00:30:26,624 --> 00:30:30,970
I can't believe
you made me say this.

500
00:30:39,970 --> 00:30:45,575
Look at this! Spring training
in lovely Scottsdale, Arizona.

501
00:30:45,576 --> 00:30:48,443
Let's go!

502
00:30:48,444 --> 00:30:51,250
- Beth.
- Mm-hm?

503
00:30:53,250 --> 00:30:55,961
I have to fire you.

504
00:31:04,961 --> 00:31:06,595
No crying.

505
00:31:06,596 --> 00:31:11,133
This has been fun,
but it's just not good.

506
00:31:11,134 --> 00:31:14,569
It's just not good. Tulip says
you're coming between us.

507
00:31:14,570 --> 00:31:20,143
And she's right. So, do yourself a
favor and just take the money...

508
00:31:20,144 --> 00:31:22,044
Why don't you
do yourself a favor,

509
00:31:22,045 --> 00:31:23,013
and get rid of your
miserable fucking wife.

510
00:31:24,013 --> 00:31:26,382
OK, out of the car.

511
00:31:26,383 --> 00:31:31,554
You are so fun,
you love to have fun.

512
00:31:31,555 --> 00:31:33,355
You do!
And you're wonderful,

513
00:31:33,356 --> 00:31:35,224
and she doesn't want you
to have fun.

514
00:31:35,225 --> 00:31:38,361
That's not true.

515
00:31:38,362 --> 00:31:42,498
Look, come on.
Just stop crying.

516
00:31:42,499 --> 00:31:45,468
Get out.
Get out of the car.

517
00:31:45,469 --> 00:31:49,742
- OK!
- I'm a married man.

518
00:31:52,742 --> 00:31:55,178
Why are you so afraid
of losing her?

519
00:31:55,179 --> 00:31:57,348
She's not afraid
of losing you...

520
00:31:58,348 --> 00:32:00,583
Beth...

521
00:32:00,584 --> 00:32:04,554
It doesn't always help when someone
thinks you're the greatest,

522
00:32:04,555 --> 00:32:07,526
and you don't think
you're the greatest.

523
00:32:09,526 --> 00:32:12,763
Bye Beth.

524
00:32:13,763 --> 00:32:15,702
Watch your toes.

525
00:32:18,702 --> 00:32:21,671
# There you go baby #

526
00:32:21,672 --> 00:32:25,040
# Here and now Well you #

527
00:32:25,041 --> 00:32:28,277
# Left me here So I could #

528
00:32:28,278 --> 00:32:31,079
# Sit and cry #

529
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:32,715
# Golly gee... #

530
00:32:34,351 --> 00:32:37,252
Beth.
Come on, open up.

531
00:32:37,253 --> 00:32:42,626
# I guess it doesn't
matter anymore #

532
00:32:43,626 --> 00:32:46,662
# Do you remember, baby #

533
00:32:46,663 --> 00:32:50,098
# Last September, how you #

534
00:32:50,099 --> 00:32:55,704
# Held me tight
Each and every night #

535
00:32:55,705 --> 00:33:01,309
# Oh baby,
how you drove me crazy #

536
00:33:01,310 --> 00:33:06,356
# But I guess it doesn't
matter anymore #

537
00:33:16,259 --> 00:33:18,227
Anyway, to hell with Dink.

538
00:33:18,228 --> 00:33:20,162
- Fuck him.
- - Fuck him!

539
00:33:20,163 --> 00:33:21,731
I mean, when you're
in love with somebody

540
00:33:21,732 --> 00:33:24,700
you overlook certain things
but there would've been

541
00:33:24,701 --> 00:33:27,502
a lot to overlook with Dink.

542
00:33:27,503 --> 00:33:29,440
I mean, Tulip definitely
earns her money.

543
00:33:29,441 --> 00:33:32,107
You don't clip
nose hair for money.

544
00:33:32,108 --> 00:33:35,143
You clip nose hair for love.

545
00:33:35,144 --> 00:33:37,447
Tulip loves him, girl.

546
00:33:37,448 --> 00:33:40,868
- You want to hit the head?
- No, I'll wait here.

547
00:33:58,868 --> 00:34:03,573
Hey, I just wanted to let you know
that this game is for retards.

548
00:34:03,574 --> 00:34:07,242
- Really?
- Yeah, it always looks like it's just about to fall,

549
00:34:07,243 --> 00:34:09,544
but it never does,
that's the hook.

550
00:34:09,545 --> 00:34:13,582
Huh. It's so well-designed.

551
00:34:13,583 --> 00:34:16,721
Yeah.

552
00:34:17,721 --> 00:34:19,697
OK.

553
00:34:27,697 --> 00:34:30,399
Back on the horse?
Go Beth.

554
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:33,139
No, I was just saving him
from Flip-It.

555
00:34:35,139 --> 00:34:38,573
But he was cute, right?
Sweet.

556
00:34:38,574 --> 00:34:40,510
It was nice to talk to somebody
for a minute, who's not...

557
00:34:40,511 --> 00:34:42,310
Yeah, I know.

558
00:34:42,311 --> 00:34:44,379
- One of us?
- Yeah, who're you texting?

559
00:34:44,380 --> 00:34:48,517
My shrink. He's got a tip
about a game tomorrow.

560
00:34:48,518 --> 00:34:52,559
Hey, your boyfriend's looking over here.
The Flip-It guy.

561
00:34:56,559 --> 00:34:59,428
The rooms here got Toblerone
candy in the minibar.

562
00:34:59,429 --> 00:35:03,399
- Bring me back one in the morning.
- Stop it, shut up.

563
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:04,901
Bye.

564
00:35:04,902 --> 00:35:08,337
I just have to make sure

565
00:35:08,338 --> 00:35:10,906
that you got home OK.

566
00:35:10,907 --> 00:35:15,246
- Wait.
- Going down.

567
00:35:21,717 --> 00:35:25,288
You should definitely, definitely
take me to your room right now.

568
00:35:25,289 --> 00:35:27,224
Should we just talk
about this for one second?

569
00:35:27,225 --> 00:35:29,457
- Why?
- Well, you are a little drunk.

570
00:35:29,458 --> 00:35:32,395
Yeah, but it just makes me more
articulate about my feelings.

571
00:35:32,396 --> 00:35:34,564
And right now,
I have a huge amount

572
00:35:34,565 --> 00:35:36,866
of sexual tension
built up inside of me,

573
00:35:36,867 --> 00:35:41,870
and I think you're very, very
handsome and really nice, and...

574
00:35:41,871 --> 00:35:43,439
Can we be done talking now?

575
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:45,408
Yeah.

576
00:35:45,409 --> 00:35:47,475
- Wait, are you single?
- Oh, yeah.

577
00:35:47,476 --> 00:35:50,379
Come on, Ten!

578
00:35:50,380 --> 00:35:54,283
Come on, Ten! Come on, baby!
Come on! Go!

579
00:35:54,284 --> 00:35:57,920
Go! Go! Oh yeah!
Oh yeah! Oh yeah!

580
00:36:00,690 --> 00:36:03,993
Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes!
Back to one!

581
00:36:03,994 --> 00:36:06,361
Way to go, Dinky!

582
00:36:06,362 --> 00:36:10,433
Way to come back
from Santa Anita!

583
00:36:10,434 --> 00:36:12,670
- Yeah!
- Yes!

584
00:36:13,670 --> 00:36:14,938
I didn't bet it.

585
00:36:14,939 --> 00:36:16,973
What?

586
00:36:16,974 --> 00:36:18,875
No, but you picked
the ten to win.

587
00:36:18,876 --> 00:36:21,516
But then I didn't bet it.

588
00:36:26,516 --> 00:36:27,851
Just get back to your phones,

589
00:36:27,852 --> 00:36:29,584
and stay out of
my fucking bets.

590
00:36:29,585 --> 00:36:31,356
The fucker!

591
00:36:33,356 --> 00:36:35,524
One-point-two remaining.

592
00:36:35,525 --> 00:36:37,027
They need to go
the length of the floor.

593
00:36:53,376 --> 00:36:56,412
Oh, no!
Now I'm down 172.

594
00:36:56,413 --> 00:36:58,382
And just for the last
five days, Scotty.

595
00:36:58,383 --> 00:36:59,982
And nobody takes it seriously!

596
00:36:59,983 --> 00:37:02,752
Where's Frankie?
We gotta make these runs!

597
00:37:02,753 --> 00:37:04,687
He's at Celine Dion.

598
00:37:04,688 --> 00:37:09,292
On a Saturday? During the
NCAA Basketball playoffs?

599
00:37:09,293 --> 00:37:11,326
That's when he's going
to Celine Dion?

600
00:37:11,327 --> 00:37:13,562
During the
NCAA Basketball tournament?

601
00:37:13,563 --> 00:37:15,463
Well, you told him
last week he could go.

602
00:37:15,464 --> 00:37:17,465
It's the only show he could
get orchestra seats.

603
00:37:17,466 --> 00:37:19,668
How many time does this guy
gotta go see Celine Dion?

604
00:37:19,669 --> 00:37:21,403
Dink, maybe I should
just make the run myself.

605
00:37:21,404 --> 00:37:23,440
Scotty, will you shut up?
No, we need somebody here

606
00:37:23,441 --> 00:37:25,941
by 11, at least,
or today is a wash.

607
00:37:25,942 --> 00:37:28,012
And this day was the only way I
had of making up for this week.

608
00:37:29,012 --> 00:37:32,915
So, Jesus fucking Christ, God!

609
00:37:32,916 --> 00:37:36,919
- Flagstaff Aaron.
- He's working for Dave the Rave.

610
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:38,953
- Call Holly.
- Uh...

611
00:37:38,954 --> 00:37:40,589
I don't think it's a good idea

612
00:37:40,590 --> 00:37:42,425
to send Holly out
with this kind of money,

613
00:37:42,426 --> 00:37:45,493
I think it actually may be a bad idea.
Look, Dink.

614
00:37:45,494 --> 00:37:47,097
I can do the run really
fast, get back here...

615
00:37:47,098 --> 00:37:49,364
No, no.
These lines are changing.

616
00:37:49,365 --> 00:37:52,637
I need you on the phone.
Just get Holly over here.

617
00:37:57,740 --> 00:38:02,044
- This is baby oil.
- Yeah?

618
00:38:02,045 --> 00:38:04,046
Why don't you use sun screen.

619
00:38:04,047 --> 00:38:06,784
Because it screens the sun.

620
00:38:08,784 --> 00:38:11,821
OK Holly, this is the $9,000
for the horses at Bally's.

621
00:38:11,822 --> 00:38:14,556
- All right.
- Take this $31,000 over to the Golden Nugget

622
00:38:14,557 --> 00:38:16,591
and call me once
you get over there.

623
00:38:16,592 --> 00:38:18,094
Gimme the line on Kentucky and
I'll tell you where to put it.

624
00:38:18,095 --> 00:38:20,865
- OK.
- All right, hurry please.

625
00:38:22,865 --> 00:38:27,370
- Unleashing a furious late kick...
- Get up.

626
00:38:27,371 --> 00:38:30,705
...up on the outside, the tenth
lead in the shadow of The Liar.

627
00:38:30,706 --> 00:38:33,042
- Mr. Jazz...
- Good?

628
00:38:33,043 --> 00:38:34,877
So that's plus 80, right?

629
00:38:34,878 --> 00:38:37,379
What line did Holly give
you on the Kentucky game?

630
00:38:37,380 --> 00:38:38,948
She hasn't called yet.

631
00:38:38,949 --> 00:38:40,783
What? What are you
talking about?

632
00:38:40,784 --> 00:38:42,883
She hasn't called. I've
been trying her for an hour

633
00:38:42,884 --> 00:38:44,753
and she's going
straight to voice mail.

634
00:38:44,754 --> 00:38:45,020
You haven't talked
to Holly for an hour,

635
00:38:46,021 --> 00:38:47,891
and you're just
telling me right now?

636
00:38:47,892 --> 00:38:50,926
Call her back, Scotty.

637
00:38:50,927 --> 00:38:52,962
- Call her back!
- Yeah, all right.

638
00:38:52,963 --> 00:38:56,665
And I hope you're
precious Celine Dion

639
00:38:56,666 --> 00:38:58,001
chokes on a wire
coat hanger tonight.

640
00:38:59,001 --> 00:39:01,875
Huh?

641
00:39:04,875 --> 00:39:07,475
Nothing. Sorry, man.

642
00:39:07,476 --> 00:39:09,880
Still voice mail.

643
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:13,716
Dave the Rave's at Bally's.

644
00:39:13,717 --> 00:39:15,887
I've been here since, like 11.

645
00:39:17,887 --> 00:39:19,921
I ain't seen her, Dinky.

646
00:39:19,922 --> 00:39:22,124
She was here.

647
00:39:22,125 --> 00:39:23,826
She was watching the game.

648
00:39:23,827 --> 00:39:25,995
She bet Toronto?!

649
00:39:25,996 --> 00:39:27,898
Magic, is that
what you just said?

650
00:39:27,899 --> 00:39:31,433
- Oh God, oh God, oh God.
- I got her.

651
00:39:31,434 --> 00:39:33,201
Oh, God...

652
00:39:33,202 --> 00:39:36,974
Fucking asshole.
Come on, take it.

653
00:39:37,974 --> 00:39:39,975
No, you didn't, no, you didn't!

654
00:39:39,976 --> 00:39:41,477
You did not get robbed, Holly!

655
00:39:41,478 --> 00:39:43,879
What you did was take
$40,000 of my money,

656
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:47,850
and go and make a bet for yourself on Toronto.
That is what you did.

657
00:39:47,851 --> 00:39:50,518
My shrink said
it was a sure thing.

658
00:39:50,519 --> 00:39:53,925
God.

659
00:39:55,925 --> 00:39:57,660
Just come back to the office.

660
00:39:57,661 --> 00:39:59,861
I'm never coming to the office.

661
00:39:59,862 --> 00:40:03,698
Jesus, Dink.
I should just fucking off myself, I should!

662
00:40:03,699 --> 00:40:06,935
Don't do that, don't do that.
Just please,

663
00:40:06,936 --> 00:40:10,072
come back to the office, Holly, and we'll
work out some kind of payment plan.

664
00:40:14,010 --> 00:40:16,111
- Don't say it.
- I didn't say anything.

665
00:40:16,112 --> 00:40:18,513
I could hear you thinkin' it.

666
00:40:18,514 --> 00:40:23,019
Me? I wouldn't send Holly out with
money like that. She's just not...

667
00:40:25,789 --> 00:40:28,025
- It's not like me or Frankie.
- Or Beth.

668
00:40:29,025 --> 00:40:32,560
Yeah, you have to stay
here and watch the phones.

669
00:40:32,561 --> 00:40:35,500
So, you...

670
00:40:36,500 --> 00:40:37,966
...you...

671
00:40:37,967 --> 00:40:41,803
...and Celine Dion,
and Beth are all fired.

672
00:40:41,804 --> 00:40:44,073
So get out!
Get out!

673
00:40:44,074 --> 00:40:47,843
Get the fuck out!
Get the fuck out!

674
00:40:47,844 --> 00:40:50,882
God damn it!

675
00:41:03,260 --> 00:41:06,261
- No way.
- Tulip, please.

676
00:41:06,262 --> 00:41:08,264
Do you think I would even ask
for something like this,

677
00:41:08,265 --> 00:41:10,832
unless I really
needed it desperately?

678
00:41:10,833 --> 00:41:13,806
And what do I get?

679
00:41:16,806 --> 00:41:18,818
Whatever you want.

680
00:41:29,818 --> 00:41:31,854
OK, I'll get Otis,

681
00:41:31,855 --> 00:41:34,556
and everything else goes in a laundry bag.
I'll be right back.

682
00:41:34,557 --> 00:41:36,659
And you can really do this?
Just pick up and leave town?

683
00:41:36,660 --> 00:41:39,794
Yes. That's what's so great about
living in a motel and getting fired.

684
00:41:39,795 --> 00:41:41,763
If I didn't do this
I'd be crazy.

685
00:41:41,764 --> 00:41:44,799
I can hear the logic rattling
around in there somewhere.

686
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:47,937
Uh-huh. Your trip back is going to be
a lot more fun then your trip out.

687
00:41:47,938 --> 00:41:50,128
Of that, I am
completely assured.

688
00:42:13,128 --> 00:42:16,799
Hi. What are you doing?

689
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:18,299
I was about to check out.

690
00:42:18,300 --> 00:42:21,303
Good. This place is a dump.

691
00:42:21,304 --> 00:42:25,876
- Where are you moving to?
- New York City.

692
00:42:27,876 --> 00:42:30,346
When'd you decide that?

693
00:42:30,347 --> 00:42:32,385
About two hours ago.

694
00:42:36,385 --> 00:42:37,657
I need you back.

695
00:42:41,657 --> 00:42:44,926
- You were really mean to me.
- I know, I know.

696
00:42:44,927 --> 00:42:46,862
I'm sorry,
it couldn't be helped.

697
00:42:46,863 --> 00:42:50,165
But the way we were,
it just... wasn't going right.

698
00:42:50,166 --> 00:42:55,738
We had to snap out of it,
but I need you back. Now.

699
00:42:55,739 --> 00:42:57,305
And what about Tulip.

700
00:42:57,306 --> 00:42:59,375
We worked it out.

701
00:42:59,376 --> 00:43:04,879
We came to terms that
we could agree upon.

702
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:07,216
Unromantic terms.

703
00:43:07,217 --> 00:43:09,789
For me and you, yeah.

704
00:43:13,789 --> 00:43:15,257
So, why do you want me back?

705
00:43:15,258 --> 00:43:17,125
How could you even ask that?

706
00:43:17,126 --> 00:43:19,160
Beth, you are
terrific with numbers.

707
00:43:19,161 --> 00:43:22,864
You're great on the phone.
People love talking to you.

708
00:43:22,865 --> 00:43:26,100
You keep your cool.
I trust you.

709
00:43:26,101 --> 00:43:29,104
And you bring me good luck.

710
00:43:29,105 --> 00:43:32,808
Beth, you are
crucial to Dink, Inc.

711
00:43:32,809 --> 00:43:35,090
Isn't that enough?

712
00:43:47,090 --> 00:43:49,223
- Hi...
- Is that a loan shark?

713
00:43:49,224 --> 00:43:51,894
'Cause you could use me as a human shield,
but I'm not sure I could take him.

714
00:43:51,895 --> 00:43:54,796
No...
He's not a loan shark.

715
00:43:54,797 --> 00:43:57,098
I know.

716
00:43:57,099 --> 00:43:59,401
Pretty sure that's
the famous Dink.

717
00:43:59,402 --> 00:44:01,470
Yeah.

718
00:44:01,471 --> 00:44:04,175
Not exactly what
I was picturing.

719
00:44:06,175 --> 00:44:08,016
So, where's Otis?

720
00:44:13,016 --> 00:44:15,984
Take this.
Put it on shuffle.

721
00:44:15,985 --> 00:44:18,821
I thought you were over it.

722
00:44:18,822 --> 00:44:22,491
I'm over him, but not over it.

723
00:44:22,492 --> 00:44:24,260
I kind of thought
it was the same thing.

724
00:44:24,261 --> 00:44:28,163
Yeah, I did too. But I just
found out that it's not.

725
00:44:28,164 --> 00:44:31,335
I'm sorry, Jeremy.

726
00:44:33,335 --> 00:44:35,037
Well...

727
00:44:35,038 --> 00:44:39,010
- Call me sometime?
- I will.

728
00:44:42,010 --> 00:44:44,178
I, I will.

729
00:44:44,179 --> 00:44:46,056
Adios, muchacha.

730
00:44:54,056 --> 00:44:56,058
- Is she mad at me?
- No.

731
00:44:56,059 --> 00:44:58,127
Not allowed to be.

732
00:44:58,128 --> 00:44:59,894
What do you mean,
that was part of the deal

733
00:44:59,895 --> 00:45:01,998
for me coming back to work?
She can't be mad at me?

734
00:45:01,999 --> 00:45:03,866
Yeah, sort of.

735
00:45:03,867 --> 00:45:05,201
So, what does she
get in the deal?

736
00:45:05,202 --> 00:45:08,035
Jesus, how do you
know these things?

737
00:45:08,036 --> 00:45:10,272
Shopping spree?

738
00:45:10,273 --> 00:45:13,107
I wish. Face lift.

739
00:45:13,108 --> 00:45:15,209
- Whoa!
- Whoa.

740
00:45:15,210 --> 00:45:18,351
I must really
mean a lot to you.

741
00:45:21,351 --> 00:45:23,954
I missed you.

742
00:45:25,954 --> 00:45:27,855
Say you missed me, too.

743
00:45:27,856 --> 00:45:29,924
I missed you, too.

744
00:45:29,925 --> 00:45:32,896
We're friends, right?

745
00:45:33,896 --> 00:45:36,501
Whatever.

746
00:45:38,501 --> 00:45:43,418
I got to stop by and drop off
Jyrki's hamster food at the house.

747
00:45:55,418 --> 00:45:57,919
Go upstairs and say hi.

748
00:45:57,920 --> 00:46:00,393
It's important.

749
00:46:03,393 --> 00:46:05,093
- OK.
- Be nice.

750
00:46:05,094 --> 00:46:06,413
Yeah.

751
00:46:50,539 --> 00:46:54,311
Do not fuck my husband.

752
00:46:56,311 --> 00:46:58,048
OK.

753
00:47:00,048 --> 00:47:03,384
He says you're good luck.

754
00:47:03,385 --> 00:47:07,362
He told me he doesn't
really think you're a jinx.

755
00:47:13,362 --> 00:47:17,366
The bag of frozen peas
in the cooler.

756
00:47:17,367 --> 00:47:20,342
Stick it on my face.

757
00:47:27,342 --> 00:47:30,182
Sorry.

758
00:47:42,659 --> 00:47:45,127
Bethy!

759
00:47:45,128 --> 00:47:47,129
- Did you miss me, sweet stuff?
- Yes.

760
00:47:47,130 --> 00:47:50,036
Hey, kid. Welcome
back, welcome back.

761
00:47:53,036 --> 00:47:56,705
Five dimes on Miss Israel
and she can't make the top 10?

762
00:47:56,706 --> 00:48:00,207
It's so good that you're back,
because things have just not been...

763
00:48:00,208 --> 00:48:01,481
...good.

764
00:48:05,481 --> 00:48:09,417
Hey! What the fuck
are you doing here?

765
00:48:09,418 --> 00:48:12,187
Uh... I live here.

766
00:48:12,188 --> 00:48:14,455
That's what the fuck
I'm doing here.

767
00:48:14,456 --> 00:48:17,058
- Where should I be?
- I don't know.

768
00:48:17,059 --> 00:48:20,227
Taking your clothes off somewhere
until you pay Dink back?

769
00:48:20,228 --> 00:48:22,032
Dink and I will work it out.

770
00:48:23,032 --> 00:48:27,672
What? So you're just cool with
stealing his money from him?

771
00:48:29,672 --> 00:48:33,107
And you're just cool trying
to steal him from Tulip?

772
00:48:33,108 --> 00:48:36,345
Hey, that's not the same thing.

773
00:48:36,346 --> 00:48:38,349
Oh, you got that right.

774
00:48:40,349 --> 00:48:43,986
Come on, Beth.
It's all good.

775
00:48:43,987 --> 00:48:47,989
We all got away from some kind
of fucking bullshit some place.

776
00:48:47,990 --> 00:48:50,327
And we all came here because
this is where you get a break.

777
00:48:52,327 --> 00:48:55,230
But sometimes,
you got to give one, too.

778
00:48:55,231 --> 00:48:57,268
Take a penny, leave a penny.
Know what I mean?

779
00:48:59,268 --> 00:49:02,203
I mean, you want to hold
people to a higher standard?

780
00:49:02,204 --> 00:49:04,172
I'd first take
a look in the mirror.

781
00:49:04,173 --> 00:49:09,076
Next thing I'd do is
move some place else.

782
00:49:09,077 --> 00:49:11,447
You stay here?

783
00:49:12,447 --> 00:49:14,383
You're one of us.

784
00:49:14,384 --> 00:49:16,760
Have a great day, honey.

785
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:26,460
I spent the whole day,
the whole day with a 103 fever!

786
00:49:26,461 --> 00:49:30,399
Now, then KC, I gotta lose on a fumble?
Are you kidding me?

787
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:34,136
Are you kidding me right now?!

788
00:49:34,137 --> 00:49:36,303
Sunday! All day Sunday.

789
00:49:36,304 --> 00:49:39,306
Sunday night I wanted to
kill myself, I swear to God.

790
00:49:39,307 --> 00:49:41,475
And then I gotta
take this game.

791
00:49:41,476 --> 00:49:44,678
We are officially on damage
control conditions right now...

792
00:49:44,679 --> 00:49:46,647
- I, I...
- You what?!

793
00:49:46,648 --> 00:49:49,083
You what? You what? You were
supposed to bring me luck.

794
00:49:49,084 --> 00:49:50,650
- Me?
- That's what you were supposed to bring back.

795
00:49:50,651 --> 00:49:52,552
Like the cat that
came back, but you didn't.

796
00:49:52,553 --> 00:49:54,755
- You just brought me bad luck.
- Come on, it was one bet.

797
00:49:54,756 --> 00:49:56,523
Just one bet?
Oh, is that what it was?

798
00:49:56,524 --> 00:49:58,391
- Yeah, it was just one bet!
- What do you know about gaming?

799
00:49:58,392 --> 00:49:59,795
Do you think you
understand how this works?

800
00:49:59,796 --> 00:50:02,797
How my business works?
You don't. Get out!

801
00:50:02,798 --> 00:50:06,567
Just get out! Get, get out!

802
00:50:06,568 --> 00:50:09,404
Help her out. You, too. Get out!
You, too. Scott!

803
00:50:09,405 --> 00:50:12,374
Get out! Get out! Hurry up!
Get your fucking bag!

804
00:50:12,375 --> 00:50:16,845
Get out! Get out! Scott, go!
Please! Get out!

805
00:50:16,846 --> 00:50:19,647
My God, what was that?

806
00:50:19,648 --> 00:50:21,548
He's been firing everybody
every couple of days.

807
00:50:21,549 --> 00:50:23,820
- Only lasts an hour or two.
- Why is he being like this?

808
00:50:23,821 --> 00:50:26,587
- It's like he's not Dink.
- That is Dink. That is Dink losing.

809
00:50:26,588 --> 00:50:30,225
Bad, like he'd be heading towards broke if
he doesn't pull out of this debt spiral.

810
00:50:30,226 --> 00:50:31,758
Well, what do we do?
How do we help him?

811
00:50:31,759 --> 00:50:33,527
There's nothing
we can do for him.

812
00:50:33,528 --> 00:50:35,295
What do you mean? What are we
going to do if he goes broke?

813
00:50:35,296 --> 00:50:36,831
Go and work for somebody else.
Take it easy, Beth.

814
00:50:36,832 --> 00:50:38,599
- Take it easy?
- This happens at some point

815
00:50:38,600 --> 00:50:40,603
and lots of points to everybody.
You should know that by now.

816
00:50:40,604 --> 00:50:43,305
- This is gambling.
- Call this gambling for a reason.

817
00:50:43,306 --> 00:50:45,238
Yeah, I just...
I didn't think...

818
00:50:45,239 --> 00:50:47,208
Didn't think what?
That it'd happen to Dink?

819
00:50:47,209 --> 00:50:49,378
Yeah, it happens to the good guys, too.
Maybe more, even.

820
00:50:49,379 --> 00:50:51,446
- If anything, you come back.
- Hell yeah.

821
00:50:51,447 --> 00:50:53,246
And that's the best
feeling in the world, man.

822
00:50:53,247 --> 00:50:54,682
- Let's grab a date shake.
- All right.

823
00:50:54,683 --> 00:50:56,155
You're buying,
you cheap bastard.

824
00:51:11,300 --> 00:51:14,505
You were supposed
to bring it back.

825
00:51:16,505 --> 00:51:19,376
Bring what back?
Your luck?

826
00:51:21,376 --> 00:51:25,150
I can't do that.
It's not my responsibility.

827
00:51:28,150 --> 00:51:31,755
So, you're just going to leave
me now that I'm falling apart?

828
00:51:33,755 --> 00:51:36,658
Well, I can't stay here when
you're like this. It's too...

829
00:51:36,659 --> 00:51:39,794
...depressing.

830
00:51:39,795 --> 00:51:42,733
You are a very selfish person.

831
00:51:43,733 --> 00:51:45,332
What?

832
00:51:45,333 --> 00:51:49,504
Hey, what do you want me to do?

833
00:51:49,505 --> 00:51:53,341
What do you want me to do?

834
00:51:53,342 --> 00:51:56,947
Take it. I accept
your resignation.

835
00:51:57,947 --> 00:52:01,816
It's been nice knowing you.
Bye, Beth.

836
00:52:01,817 --> 00:52:04,752
Hey Dink, you sure you want to
be giving away money right now?

837
00:52:04,753 --> 00:52:07,254
Just get out.

838
00:52:07,255 --> 00:52:12,826
If you want to quit,
that's fine. OK?

839
00:52:12,827 --> 00:52:17,531
Just don't go do one of your
stupid hustles for money.

840
00:52:17,532 --> 00:52:21,569
- Mm-hm.
- Just go do something.

841
00:52:21,570 --> 00:52:24,215
Are you done?

842
00:52:33,215 --> 00:52:35,222
Cashing them all in, yeah?

843
00:52:52,835 --> 00:52:54,003
Well, hello.

844
00:52:55,003 --> 00:52:57,007
Um, hi.

845
00:52:58,007 --> 00:53:01,308
It's Beth. From Las Vegas.

846
00:53:01,309 --> 00:53:03,812
Yeah, I know who Beth is.

847
00:53:03,813 --> 00:53:06,849
If I came to New York...

848
00:53:07,849 --> 00:53:09,829
...would you hang out with me?

849
00:53:20,829 --> 00:53:23,964
I mean, there are people
with MBAs waiting tables

850
00:53:23,965 --> 00:53:27,035
at the Olive Garden. What is
someone going to hire me to do?

851
00:53:27,036 --> 00:53:29,638
How did you finagle
getting your job?

852
00:53:29,639 --> 00:53:31,806
Well, it wasn't exactly
a finagling kind of thing.

853
00:53:31,807 --> 00:53:33,741
Well then, what was it?

854
00:53:33,742 --> 00:53:36,278
It's what I've always done.
I went to journalism school,

855
00:53:36,279 --> 00:53:37,779
I interned and I got a job.

856
00:53:37,780 --> 00:53:40,314
- Ugh.
- What ugh?

857
00:53:40,315 --> 00:53:42,751
I don't understand why
that sounds so crazy to you.

858
00:53:42,752 --> 00:53:45,886
It's not crazy. I just
wish that I had a path,

859
00:53:45,887 --> 00:53:48,922
like you do, you know?
You're lucky.

860
00:53:48,923 --> 00:53:51,892
Look, you just got out
of a shitty situation.

861
00:53:51,893 --> 00:53:53,762
- You got fired...
- I didn't get fired.

862
00:53:53,763 --> 00:53:58,299
- You quit.
- I don't know what happened.

863
00:53:58,300 --> 00:54:00,834
I gotta say,

864
00:54:00,835 --> 00:54:04,007
I don't want to be around
him if he can be like that.

865
00:54:05,007 --> 00:54:08,615
I don't want to
see him like that.

866
00:54:13,615 --> 00:54:16,417
Gamblers.

867
00:54:16,418 --> 00:54:18,553
- I'm sorry.
- Sorry for what?

868
00:54:18,554 --> 00:54:21,023
For bitching and moaning.
I'll find something to do.

869
00:54:22,023 --> 00:54:25,359
Six months ago, all I wanted to
do was be a cocktail waitress.

870
00:54:25,360 --> 00:54:27,730
And now you want something more.
That's a good thing, right?

871
00:54:27,731 --> 00:54:30,333
Yes, definitely.

872
00:54:31,333 --> 00:54:35,470
You're so...
great, Jeremy.

873
00:54:35,471 --> 00:54:37,007
Let's just focus
on you and me...

874
00:54:38,007 --> 00:54:42,343
...having a
really good time.

875
00:54:42,344 --> 00:54:44,719
I fucking love that plan.

876
00:54:57,425 --> 00:54:58,130
Up top!

877
00:55:01,130 --> 00:55:03,835
- Yes!
- - Good shot!

878
00:55:05,835 --> 00:55:07,868
Hey, good game, man.

879
00:55:07,869 --> 00:55:10,738
You're like
Spud Webb out there.

880
00:55:10,739 --> 00:55:12,707
- You play ball?
- Uh-huh.

881
00:55:12,708 --> 00:55:15,108
Junior college, I had a
scholarship but I lost it.

882
00:55:15,109 --> 00:55:16,012
You play for St. John's?

883
00:55:17,012 --> 00:55:21,683
Yep, class of '87.
They're playing tonight.

884
00:55:21,684 --> 00:55:24,518
Man, I'd lay some big money on that
game if I could find that action.

885
00:55:24,519 --> 00:55:28,692
- They are a lock.
- Really? You like to bet?

886
00:55:29,692 --> 00:55:31,096
On anything that moves.

887
00:55:34,096 --> 00:55:37,765
Hi, I'm Beth.

888
00:55:37,766 --> 00:55:39,968
Dave Greenberg.

889
00:55:39,969 --> 00:55:42,519
Beth.

890
00:55:57,519 --> 00:55:59,452
I am not religious,
and I don't want to speculate

891
00:55:59,453 --> 00:56:01,722
on what kind of
chosen person I am,

892
00:56:01,723 --> 00:56:03,925
or what kind of power
center is inside of me.

893
00:56:03,926 --> 00:56:08,163
But the truth is the truth,
I needed you and you came.

894
00:56:08,164 --> 00:56:11,131
- OK...
- This is temporary right here.

895
00:56:11,132 --> 00:56:13,100
I have a much more permanent,

896
00:56:13,101 --> 00:56:16,437
more epic situation
that is in the works.

897
00:56:16,438 --> 00:56:18,139
But I'm not at liberty
to discuss it right now.

898
00:56:18,140 --> 00:56:20,674
So, for God's sakes,
do not ask me about it.

899
00:56:20,675 --> 00:56:25,113
So, now, Beth. How do you
suggest I re-imagine my vortex

900
00:56:25,114 --> 00:56:27,214
in a way that indispensably,
includes you.

901
00:56:27,215 --> 00:56:29,750
Well, I'm good on the phone

902
00:56:29,751 --> 00:56:31,719
and I like going on
pay and collects...

903
00:56:31,720 --> 00:56:35,556
Hey. Yo, Gids.

904
00:56:35,557 --> 00:56:39,093
Why not? I'll give you
six points. Later, fool.

905
00:56:39,094 --> 00:56:41,796
Pay and collect,
some phone, I like it.

906
00:56:41,797 --> 00:56:44,233
I like where this is going.
Yes. How's 40 an hour to start?

907
00:56:44,234 --> 00:56:47,835
Oh, great. Didn't you
just make a bet?

908
00:56:47,836 --> 00:56:50,239
- Yes.
- So, aren't you going to write it down?

909
00:56:51,239 --> 00:56:53,475
Oh.

910
00:56:53,476 --> 00:56:54,943
I can see there's something
that you're thinking,

911
00:56:54,944 --> 00:56:57,178
- but you're not saying.
- Yeah.

912
00:56:57,179 --> 00:56:59,247
Well, there's this guy I know,

913
00:56:59,248 --> 00:57:02,783
and he likes to bet like crazy
and he can't find any action,

914
00:57:02,784 --> 00:57:04,920
and he has friends that want to get down, too.
And I thought, maybe,

915
00:57:04,921 --> 00:57:09,223
I could put them onto you? And, um,
they seem ready to bet, like, a, a lot.

916
00:57:09,224 --> 00:57:13,160
- Fun, great. You agent it.
- Me, really?

917
00:57:13,161 --> 00:57:14,795
This'll be a nice thing
on the side for you.

918
00:57:14,796 --> 00:57:16,496
Whatever he loses,
I'll give you 25 percent,

919
00:57:16,497 --> 00:57:18,000
but these guys are
your responsibility.

920
00:57:18,001 --> 00:57:20,734
Oh, my God, this is great.

921
00:57:20,735 --> 00:57:24,038
Beth, dude. Your initiative,
it is impressive.

922
00:57:24,039 --> 00:57:25,907
- Yes.
- You started working for me,

923
00:57:25,908 --> 00:57:28,542
before you started working for me.
That is unprecedented.

924
00:57:28,543 --> 00:57:30,578
You're like a hungry woman
lying on the prowl,

925
00:57:30,579 --> 00:57:32,880
but you listen to things,
and you smell everything.

926
00:57:32,881 --> 00:57:34,617
Look at this line
here on Boston.

927
00:57:34,618 --> 00:57:36,750
I'm going to salvage this,
right now.

928
00:57:36,751 --> 00:57:39,888
Rosie, 651.

929
00:57:39,889 --> 00:57:42,890
Take me 200k Boston...

930
00:57:42,891 --> 00:57:47,261
...Rosie, 651.
Right motherfucking now!

931
00:57:47,262 --> 00:57:49,863
Thank you. Bang!

932
00:57:49,864 --> 00:57:52,100
So, anyway... What?

933
00:57:52,101 --> 00:57:54,003
Well, you just made a bet for $200,000
in the middle of our conversation.

934
00:57:55,003 --> 00:57:58,672
- And is there a problem?
- No, but you do not bet like Dink.

935
00:57:58,673 --> 00:58:00,575
Listen, I mean no disrespect.

936
00:58:00,576 --> 00:58:03,278
Dink is a famous classic.
He is a hero of mine.

937
00:58:03,279 --> 00:58:06,980
He is the '57 Chevy of gambling.

938
00:58:06,981 --> 00:58:10,317
But, all modesty aside,
I am the Ferrari.

939
00:58:10,318 --> 00:58:12,687
Or if Ferrari made
a super fast tank

940
00:58:12,688 --> 00:58:16,691
with laser blasters sticking out.
I would be that of gambling!

941
00:58:16,692 --> 00:58:18,158
We are done for today.

942
00:58:18,159 --> 00:58:21,995
This should be in the
vicinity of $6,000.

943
00:58:21,996 --> 00:58:25,133
Assigning bonus,
some clothes, some food.

944
00:58:25,134 --> 00:58:27,301
I don't want you
with the stress.

945
00:58:27,302 --> 00:58:30,671
And it's so exciting. Do you have
any idea how big Rosie's bets are?

946
00:58:30,672 --> 00:58:33,607
It's New York, where
gambling is illegal,

947
00:58:33,608 --> 00:58:35,576
and bookmaking is a felony.

948
00:58:35,577 --> 00:58:37,780
You know, because of you
I'm finally good at something.

949
00:58:37,781 --> 00:58:40,848
but I can't do it in Las Vegas
because you banned me.

950
00:58:40,849 --> 00:58:45,185
Rosie is taking action across state
lines, which of course he is doing,

951
00:58:45,186 --> 00:58:49,656
then you are opening yourself up to a
conspiracy and that's a slam dunk for RICO.

952
00:58:49,657 --> 00:58:52,727
Does that sound familiar? Does
that sound like anybody you know?

953
00:58:52,728 --> 00:58:56,296
- You're jealous of Rosie.
- Beth! When you go to jail

954
00:58:56,297 --> 00:58:58,332
it will not be my fault. OK?

955
00:58:58,333 --> 00:59:01,704
You sound like your mother.

956
00:59:02,704 --> 00:59:04,639
- Goodbye.
- Oh, come on!

957
00:59:13,916 --> 00:59:15,750
Hi, Dave.

958
00:59:15,751 --> 00:59:17,785
So, how about that
Philly game last night?

959
00:59:17,786 --> 00:59:19,953
You must be happy
to see me, huh?

960
00:59:19,954 --> 00:59:22,961
- What?
- - Thanks a lot.

961
00:59:26,961 --> 00:59:29,675
What?

962
00:59:40,675 --> 00:59:44,111
What? Dave you're actually making
us look kind of suspicious.

963
00:59:44,112 --> 00:59:46,081
Well, excuse me, Miss Mata
Hari, for not wanting

964
00:59:46,082 --> 00:59:49,216
to receive illegal cash
in front of cops.

965
00:59:49,217 --> 00:59:50,917
My car's over here.
Come on.

966
00:59:50,918 --> 00:59:54,388
Dave Greenberg's a prick.

967
00:59:54,389 --> 00:59:56,957
And he never loses.

968
00:59:56,958 --> 00:59:58,693
I like it when
they keep winning.

969
00:59:58,694 --> 01:00:00,693
That means when they lose,
they lose huge.

970
01:00:01,295 --> 01:00:03,131
Rosie, do you ever worry about

971
01:00:03,132 --> 01:00:06,167
getting caught by the
police or the FBI?

972
01:00:06,168 --> 01:00:08,301
Eh, never happens.
We're too cautious.

973
01:00:08,302 --> 01:00:10,805
- You're not cautious.
- Well, we're semi-cautious.

974
01:00:10,806 --> 01:00:14,142
No, you're not. Rosie, you play
Guitar Hero with the delivery guys

975
01:00:14,143 --> 01:00:15,911
while you take bets
on the phone.

976
01:00:15,912 --> 01:00:18,312
You left our
"who owes who what" cheats

977
01:00:18,313 --> 01:00:19,782
in the booth at the Sizzler.

978
01:00:19,783 --> 01:00:21,948
Everybody knows
you're a bookie.

979
01:00:21,949 --> 01:00:25,285
I do not like having these
kinds of conversations.

980
01:00:25,286 --> 01:00:27,721
And Beth,
I think you know that.

981
01:00:27,722 --> 01:00:31,459
And besides, as far as
what is legal or not legal,

982
01:00:31,460 --> 01:00:33,427
it's about to become a moot point,
but I will not talk about that.

983
01:00:33,428 --> 01:00:35,068
Because that, that is a secret!

984
01:00:39,068 --> 01:00:40,003
Tell me...

985
01:00:41,003 --> 01:00:43,705
OK, the Curacao thing
is getting very real.

986
01:00:43,706 --> 01:00:45,239
My license, it just
came through down there.

987
01:00:45,240 --> 01:00:47,408
I have an investor that
may cover the setup.

988
01:00:47,409 --> 01:00:52,779
My sports book shall
be called, ASAP!

989
01:00:52,780 --> 01:00:56,049
All Serious Action Players!
Completely legal.

990
01:00:56,050 --> 01:00:58,253
- Oh, that's incredible.
- Look at the eight horse.

991
01:00:58,254 --> 01:01:00,821
Where the heck did she come from?
She's going to mess up my Perfecta.

992
01:01:00,822 --> 01:01:03,424
Curacao, that's a beautiful
island in the Caribbean, right?

993
01:01:03,425 --> 01:01:06,228
- Beautiful, legit island.
- Oh... Oh, God.

994
01:01:08,731 --> 01:01:10,931
- Come on...
- You got it...

995
01:01:10,932 --> 01:01:12,733
- You got it, you got it...
- Yes!

996
01:01:12,734 --> 01:01:14,202
- There it goes!
- Yes! Yes!

997
01:01:14,203 --> 01:01:16,108
Oh, yes!

998
01:01:20,108 --> 01:01:23,343
- Yes! Yes!
- How did you do that?

999
01:01:23,344 --> 01:01:25,512
How'd you pick the eight horse to win?
She looked like absolute shit to me.

1000
01:01:25,513 --> 01:01:27,983
That was like so surreal and
yesterday it was Cleveland.

1001
01:01:27,984 --> 01:01:31,785
- You're back. You are back.
- Two weeks ago, she looked like a mess.

1002
01:01:31,786 --> 01:01:34,123
But I thought she was starting to get
her head around the whole thing.

1003
01:01:34,124 --> 01:01:39,893
Ruby Lane, Ruby Lane.
Ruby Lane...

1004
01:01:39,894 --> 01:01:41,895
What does Dink think?

1005
01:01:41,896 --> 01:01:46,200
Well, I'm not really
talking to Dink right now.

1006
01:01:46,201 --> 01:01:49,870
Beth, you made a lot of money
in the last couple of months.

1007
01:01:49,871 --> 01:01:52,874
- Why don't you just stay here with me?
- And do what?

1008
01:01:52,875 --> 01:01:55,010
Continue to have the completely fantastic
time we've been having together.

1009
01:01:56,010 --> 01:02:00,480
Look, Jeremy, I don't think you realize what
a huge deal this Curacao thing is for me.

1010
01:02:00,481 --> 01:02:05,085
I mean, I'm going to actually
be in charge of something.

1011
01:02:05,086 --> 01:02:06,855
Something that's going to
take you someplace else.

1012
01:02:06,856 --> 01:02:10,795
Yeah, but I'll come back.
I'll miss you.

1013
01:02:12,795 --> 01:02:15,062
- So, what about...
- Otis. I know.

1014
01:02:15,063 --> 01:02:17,497
I have to find somewhere
for him to stay.

1015
01:02:17,498 --> 01:02:19,902
I'll take care of Otis. I don't
want him to stay with strangers.

1016
01:02:19,903 --> 01:02:21,435
- Really?
- Yeah.

1017
01:02:21,436 --> 01:02:24,071
Oh, my God, that would be great.
He loves you.

1018
01:02:24,072 --> 01:02:25,907
- You know that, right?
- And I love him.

1019
01:02:25,908 --> 01:02:31,444
Aww...
Otis, you lucky dog.

1020
01:02:31,445 --> 01:02:35,183
Now my only problem is finding
someone to do my pay and collects.

1021
01:02:35,184 --> 01:02:38,518
Hey. You could do that too.

1022
01:02:38,519 --> 01:02:40,488
- Me?
- Yeah.

1023
01:02:40,489 --> 01:02:43,124
You can keep my cut and
feed Otis, and we're even.

1024
01:02:43,125 --> 01:02:45,259
It's easy money.

1025
01:02:45,260 --> 01:02:47,568
I'll talk you through
the whole thing.

1026
01:02:53,568 --> 01:02:55,335
Hi, Dave.

1027
01:02:55,336 --> 01:02:58,313
This is Jeremy...

1028
01:03:05,313 --> 01:03:07,952
Bye.

1029
01:03:09,952 --> 01:03:12,085
So, what's your number?

1030
01:03:12,086 --> 01:03:14,120
I'm gonna have a plain burger.

1031
01:03:14,121 --> 01:03:16,357
No bun, no sauce,
no nothing on it.

1032
01:03:16,358 --> 01:03:17,892
I know.

1033
01:03:17,893 --> 01:03:19,425
It had some barbecue sauce
on it last time,

1034
01:03:19,426 --> 01:03:21,463
and I really don't want
to go through that again.

1035
01:03:21,464 --> 01:03:25,600
So, a very plain burger and
nothing else, and a regular Coke.

1036
01:03:25,601 --> 01:03:27,935
- Got it.
- Thanks.

1037
01:03:27,936 --> 01:03:30,437
- Stomach?
- Oh, yeah.

1038
01:03:30,438 --> 01:03:33,640
Why? What's on your mind?
You're doing so good.

1039
01:03:33,641 --> 01:03:37,178
Yeah, yeah. I'm just a
little worried about Beth.

1040
01:03:37,179 --> 01:03:39,346
Dink.

1041
01:03:39,347 --> 01:03:41,616
She's working for that
maniac Rosie in New York.

1042
01:03:41,617 --> 01:03:45,919
I blew up at her and now
she's not calling me back.

1043
01:03:45,920 --> 01:03:47,922
Look, I wasn't going to say
anything, but do you notice

1044
01:03:47,923 --> 01:03:51,125
when Beth is around, you
were doing a lot of losing.

1045
01:03:51,126 --> 01:03:54,462
And now that she's gone,
you're doing really good.

1046
01:03:54,463 --> 01:03:57,364
Hey, if anyone's
the jinx, it's Beth.

1047
01:03:57,365 --> 01:03:59,366
But I owe her.

1048
01:03:59,367 --> 01:04:01,201
Owe her for what?

1049
01:04:01,202 --> 01:04:03,571
I owe her for messing
everything up.

1050
01:04:03,572 --> 01:04:07,508
I usually just think about how
much money I could've made

1051
01:04:07,509 --> 01:04:10,377
if I'd just focused a little
bit more when I was younger.

1052
01:04:10,378 --> 01:04:12,581
And I usually give myself
a hard time about it.

1053
01:04:12,582 --> 01:04:17,051
But now, I'm looking at all the
things I've got to do instead.

1054
01:04:17,052 --> 01:04:19,319
I got to be with you.

1055
01:04:19,320 --> 01:04:22,290
And it's not like
I don't appreciate you

1056
01:04:22,291 --> 01:04:24,658
on a daily basis, because I do.

1057
01:04:24,659 --> 01:04:27,528
But for the first time,
since our wedding,

1058
01:04:27,529 --> 01:04:31,000
I look at my situation, and I'm looking
at it from an oddsmaker's perspective.

1059
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:34,672
And I am a really lucky guy.

1060
01:04:37,672 --> 01:04:41,274
And to be honest, a big part
of that is because of Beth.

1061
01:04:41,275 --> 01:04:44,210
Hey, how you doin'?

1062
01:04:44,211 --> 01:04:46,379
I wanted to say hi.

1063
01:04:46,380 --> 01:04:48,716
And tell you that, um,
I hope you don't think

1064
01:04:48,717 --> 01:04:51,584
that we're in some kind of fight,
because I don't think that.

1065
01:04:51,585 --> 01:04:53,220
And, just wanted to call...

1066
01:04:53,221 --> 01:04:55,689
...and see
how you're doing.

1067
01:04:55,690 --> 01:04:58,426
Um, give me a shout
if you have a minute.

1068
01:04:58,427 --> 01:05:01,662
And I also wanted you to
know that I'm not mad

1069
01:05:01,663 --> 01:05:04,132
that you're working
for Rosie in New York.

1070
01:05:04,133 --> 01:05:06,299
So, that's about it.

1071
01:05:06,300 --> 01:05:08,234
Call me, I'm at the office,

1072
01:05:08,235 --> 01:05:12,305
and hope you're OK
and having fun.

1073
01:05:12,306 --> 01:05:14,579
OK, bye.

1074
01:05:18,579 --> 01:05:20,413
Hello, ASAP?

1075
01:05:20,414 --> 01:05:23,452
- Hello, sport?
- Hello, ASAP?

1076
01:05:25,219 --> 01:05:27,388
Can you turn the music off!

1077
01:05:27,389 --> 01:05:30,256
Hey, there are phones ringing
and you're playing video games

1078
01:05:30,257 --> 01:05:32,292
and... what? Doing coke?!

1079
01:05:32,293 --> 01:05:34,462
Oh, my God,
what are they doing here?

1080
01:05:34,463 --> 01:05:36,696
All the plumbing at their
place is backing up.

1081
01:05:36,697 --> 01:05:39,232
What, so you just move them out
of the brothel and into here?

1082
01:05:39,233 --> 01:05:41,036
If you think about it
for two seconds, Beth,

1083
01:05:41,037 --> 01:05:44,171
you'll see this saves time
and money for everybody.

1084
01:05:44,172 --> 01:05:46,009
Hey! Where've
you been for four days?

1085
01:05:47,009 --> 01:05:50,410
Bethy, I have been in love.
What is wrong with me?

1086
01:05:50,411 --> 01:05:53,314
Why is it that all of
my dreams come true?

1087
01:05:53,315 --> 01:05:55,150
Look at this line
here on Cleveland.

1088
01:05:55,151 --> 01:05:57,417
This is terrible.
Who made this line?

1089
01:05:57,418 --> 01:06:00,421
Bob made it. Look, Rosie,
when you disappear,

1090
01:06:00,422 --> 01:06:03,323
these fucking assholes you brought
down here just make shitty lines,

1091
01:06:03,324 --> 01:06:07,261
do coke, have sex with 17 year
olds, and steal from you.

1092
01:06:07,262 --> 01:06:09,430
Easy. Beth,
these are my friends.

1093
01:06:09,431 --> 01:06:11,665
Rosie, this was your big move.

1094
01:06:11,666 --> 01:06:14,201
The only important thing you've
ever done in your whole life,

1095
01:06:14,202 --> 01:06:17,203
and you're letting it fucking disintegrate!
What is wrong with you?!

1096
01:06:17,204 --> 01:06:20,107
Beth, you are the gum that
holds this all together.

1097
01:06:20,108 --> 01:06:23,544
You put up with a lot, and you
deserve respect for that.

1098
01:06:23,545 --> 01:06:27,047
I'm giving a raise to $5,000
a week, effective last week.

1099
01:06:27,048 --> 01:06:29,186
But just do not tell anybody.

1100
01:06:31,186 --> 01:06:33,319
All right, check on Motown!

1101
01:06:33,320 --> 01:06:37,625
Check on the Cuban! Somebody
call HBC and give 20 dimes to...

1102
01:06:37,626 --> 01:06:39,097
Fuck! We're getting
buried on this game!

1103
01:06:42,097 --> 01:06:44,397
Hello?

1104
01:06:44,398 --> 01:06:46,534
Did you know that
Otis runs in his sleep?

1105
01:06:46,535 --> 01:06:49,803
Yes.

1106
01:06:49,804 --> 01:06:55,408
Jeremy, how are you?
I miss you.

1107
01:06:55,409 --> 01:06:58,449
- You miss me?
- Of course I do.

1108
01:07:00,449 --> 01:07:02,583
Could you tell me
something normal?

1109
01:07:02,584 --> 01:07:04,151
Sure, like what?

1110
01:07:04,152 --> 01:07:07,187
I don't know, about
your day? Anything?

1111
01:07:07,188 --> 01:07:09,622
Have you checked
Greenberg's bets lately?

1112
01:07:09,623 --> 01:07:11,759
No.

1113
01:07:11,760 --> 01:07:13,828
He and his friends
are losing finally.

1114
01:07:13,829 --> 01:07:16,596
And big time,
like 75 grand worth.

1115
01:07:16,597 --> 01:07:18,598
Really? That's nice.

1116
01:07:18,599 --> 01:07:22,403
I can't get any of those
guys on the phone, though.

1117
01:07:22,404 --> 01:07:25,138
You're their only action,
and they're idiot addicts.

1118
01:07:25,139 --> 01:07:26,775
They'll call.

1119
01:07:30,846 --> 01:07:33,747
I gotta go.

1120
01:07:33,748 --> 01:07:36,616
Rosie's friends are
destroying the place.

1121
01:07:36,617 --> 01:07:40,821
Don't worry about Greenberg.

1122
01:07:40,822 --> 01:07:46,161
146, 152, 155 total.

1123
01:07:50,398 --> 01:07:54,273
...Minus 13. No, leave it
just at 7 and a half flat.

1124
01:07:58,273 --> 01:08:00,473
Rosie, can you turn it down?!

1125
01:08:00,474 --> 01:08:04,745
I can't Beth. This song
is the rhythm of victory!

1126
01:08:04,746 --> 01:08:08,265
Don't let the rhythm
not get you and move!

1127
01:08:23,265 --> 01:08:27,468
Beth, Dave Greenberg here.
We got a problem.

1128
01:08:27,469 --> 01:08:30,537
I, uh... got into some trouble
a couple of years ago.

1129
01:08:30,538 --> 01:08:33,840
It's a long story, but my
parole officer called me in.

1130
01:08:33,841 --> 01:08:38,312
And he wants to know about you
and who's running your office.

1131
01:08:38,313 --> 01:08:40,813
Now, don't worry
I didn't give you up,

1132
01:08:40,814 --> 01:08:43,216
but this is a fucking mess.

1133
01:08:43,217 --> 01:08:44,951
He's got all the
numbers from my phone,

1134
01:08:44,952 --> 01:08:45,921
including yours and Jeremy's.

1135
01:08:45,922 --> 01:08:50,291
So, if he calls...
just play dumb.

1136
01:08:50,292 --> 01:08:52,792
But whatever you do,
don't call me.

1137
01:08:52,793 --> 01:08:55,965
I'll call you.

1138
01:08:56,965 --> 01:08:59,465
It's not a big deal. The
Seattle game's about to start.

1139
01:08:59,466 --> 01:09:01,367
Why don't you go upstairs?

1140
01:09:01,368 --> 01:09:02,908
It's...

1141
01:09:06,908 --> 01:09:09,742
My life is over,
even if I don't go to jail.

1142
01:09:09,743 --> 01:09:11,311
If I get arrested
on a felony charge,

1143
01:09:11,312 --> 01:09:13,278
I am done forever
as a journalist.

1144
01:09:13,279 --> 01:09:15,684
I'm 98 percent sure that
Dave Greenberg is lying.

1145
01:09:15,685 --> 01:09:17,850
He just doesn't want to pay,
or he can't pay.

1146
01:09:17,851 --> 01:09:20,955
If Dave Greenberg has a parole
officer, it does seem plausible

1147
01:09:20,956 --> 01:09:23,792
that he would want to know who Dave's
bookie is, and that Dave would tell him.

1148
01:09:23,793 --> 01:09:27,827
Look! I'm going to...

1149
01:09:27,828 --> 01:09:30,230
I'm going to call Dink.

1150
01:09:30,231 --> 01:09:31,863
Wait, what? You're
going to call Dink?

1151
01:09:31,864 --> 01:09:33,801
You said you haven't
been talking to him.

1152
01:09:33,802 --> 01:09:38,339
I haven't.
But I'll just... call him.

1153
01:09:38,340 --> 01:09:39,774
- I'll call you back.
- No, no! No.

1154
01:09:39,775 --> 01:09:42,343
Do not call me back.
I am at a payphone.

1155
01:09:42,344 --> 01:09:43,944
Do not call
my phone from Curacao,

1156
01:09:43,945 --> 01:09:46,580
the gambling mecca
of the Caribbean!

1157
01:09:46,581 --> 01:09:49,883
No, no. It's not,
not a big deal.

1158
01:09:49,884 --> 01:09:51,618
That's just Rosie saying that,

1159
01:09:51,619 --> 01:09:53,320
so you'll forget about it
and go back to work.

1160
01:09:53,321 --> 01:09:56,489
Look, I'm sorry
that I abandoned you.

1161
01:09:56,490 --> 01:09:58,926
Now will you please
calm down and talk to me...

1162
01:09:58,927 --> 01:10:01,661
I appreciate your apology.

1163
01:10:01,662 --> 01:10:05,032
But I want you to know this is
a very serious situation, OK?

1164
01:10:05,033 --> 01:10:10,703
You had a felon,
paroled, the FBI...

1165
01:10:10,704 --> 01:10:13,674
I've seen go down just
like this in the past,

1166
01:10:13,675 --> 01:10:16,977
and I'm not just talking
about my circumstances, OK?

1167
01:10:16,978 --> 01:10:19,947
This is a very big problem.

1168
01:10:19,948 --> 01:10:22,515
How is it down there?

1169
01:10:22,516 --> 01:10:25,286
What, what the heck's going on?

1170
01:10:25,287 --> 01:10:28,054
I'm earning $5,000 a week.

1171
01:10:28,055 --> 01:10:29,957
Beth, you never
cared about money.

1172
01:10:29,958 --> 01:10:32,693
I thought you went down there
because it's paradise?

1173
01:10:32,694 --> 01:10:35,295
Is it paradise?

1174
01:10:35,296 --> 01:10:38,698
- No.
- Don't cry.

1175
01:10:38,699 --> 01:10:41,301
Don't cry, just...

1176
01:10:41,302 --> 01:10:44,371
Listen to me, Beth. You are the
book in this New York thing.

1177
01:10:44,372 --> 01:10:46,572
You have got to take
care of your people.

1178
01:10:46,573 --> 01:10:49,943
Your decisions are no longer
just about you anymore.

1179
01:10:49,944 --> 01:10:53,980
- You have to handle this.
- But I don't know how to handle it.

1180
01:10:53,981 --> 01:10:58,021
Yes you do, or you will.

1181
01:11:01,021 --> 01:11:02,989
Hold on one second.

1182
01:11:02,990 --> 01:11:07,594
Hey Beth?

1183
01:11:07,595 --> 01:11:10,997
Look, it's Dink's mom's
birthday on Thursday.

1184
01:11:10,998 --> 01:11:14,468
She was going to come out to Vegas, but she...
she hates flying.

1185
01:11:14,469 --> 01:11:16,404
So, if we come out to
New York, she doesn't

1186
01:11:16,405 --> 01:11:18,805
have to come out here for
her birthday, which...

1187
01:11:18,806 --> 01:11:20,907
- ...she'd love, right honey?
- Yeah.

1188
01:11:20,908 --> 01:11:23,846
We could meet you there.

1189
01:11:25,846 --> 01:11:28,587
You'd... You'd help me?

1190
01:11:32,587 --> 01:11:35,726
Yes, we'll help you help Jeremy.

1191
01:11:38,726 --> 01:11:43,563
Hey, you know when you don't need
to be taken care of anymore?

1192
01:11:43,564 --> 01:11:47,041
It's when you decide to start
taking care of someone else.

1193
01:11:53,041 --> 01:11:54,747
You still there Beth?

1194
01:11:58,747 --> 01:12:00,480
Beth, you're being crazy.

1195
01:12:00,481 --> 01:12:03,450
It's $75,000 this idiot
Greenberg owes me.

1196
01:12:03,451 --> 01:12:06,687
Who cares? I need you here.
I forgive you the Greenberg.

1197
01:12:06,688 --> 01:12:08,755
A clean slate,
you owe me nothing.

1198
01:12:08,756 --> 01:12:10,891
- But you have to stay.
- It's not about the money.

1199
01:12:10,892 --> 01:12:13,693
Well, what's it about?
Jeremy the non-boyfriend?

1200
01:12:13,694 --> 01:12:16,996
Jeremy may be in huge
trouble because of me.

1201
01:12:16,997 --> 01:12:19,967
He chose to do something not completely
legal in the state of New York.

1202
01:12:19,968 --> 01:12:21,902
You didn't force
him to do that!

1203
01:12:21,903 --> 01:12:24,438
Yeah, well he did it for me!

1204
01:12:24,439 --> 01:12:28,575
Come on, Beth! People do
things for themselves.

1205
01:12:28,576 --> 01:12:32,513
Yeah, what about saints?
And famously selfless people?

1206
01:12:32,514 --> 01:12:34,047
They do things so people
think that they're saints

1207
01:12:34,048 --> 01:12:36,983
or selfless people. People who
do things for themselves,

1208
01:12:36,984 --> 01:12:39,086
being nice,
that's just another racket!

1209
01:12:39,087 --> 01:12:43,090
Now, listen to me, Beth. I forgive the $75,000.
As long as you stay.

1210
01:12:43,091 --> 01:12:46,426
- What does that mean?
- It means if you stay,

1211
01:12:46,427 --> 01:12:49,529
you're Beth. My Beth.

1212
01:12:49,530 --> 01:12:51,732
And all is forgiven.

1213
01:12:51,733 --> 01:12:56,804
But if you leave, well,
then you're just another

1214
01:12:56,805 --> 01:13:00,176
New York agent on the hook
for her losers losses.

1215
01:13:02,176 --> 01:13:03,943
Fuck you, Rosie!

1216
01:13:03,944 --> 01:13:06,746
No, actually, Beth.
Fuck you!

1217
01:13:06,747 --> 01:13:09,049
All of your pay
is in the ASAP account.

1218
01:13:09,050 --> 01:13:11,551
Which means, I have it!

1219
01:13:11,552 --> 01:13:14,121
It's like, what is it?
Is it $60,000, give or take?

1220
01:13:14,122 --> 01:13:16,223
So you're just going to
steal my money from me?

1221
01:13:16,224 --> 01:13:19,660
Of course not. I'm
going to hold on to it

1222
01:13:19,661 --> 01:13:22,795
as collateral,
for your loser's losses.

1223
01:13:22,796 --> 01:13:25,933
You wanna go to New York?
Fine.

1224
01:13:25,934 --> 01:13:27,968
Give me my Greenberg money!

1225
01:13:27,969 --> 01:13:30,170
Then you get your Beth money!

1226
01:13:30,171 --> 01:13:32,171
You know, I am going
to deal with it.

1227
01:13:32,172 --> 01:13:33,740
And then I'm going
to come back to you,

1228
01:13:33,741 --> 01:13:35,975
and then I am going to...

1229
01:13:35,976 --> 01:13:40,214
...stab you in the groin
artery with a steak knife

1230
01:13:40,215 --> 01:13:45,219
and watch TV while you bleed out,
you fucking horrible person!

1231
01:13:45,220 --> 01:13:47,121
- Come on, let's go.
- Whoa, Beth! I think everyone is saying things here

1232
01:13:47,122 --> 01:13:49,790
that they don't mean!
Except for me!

1233
01:13:49,791 --> 01:13:53,729
Beth, you are
being very selfish!

1234
01:13:55,729 --> 01:13:58,534
- Safe flight, ma'am.
- Thank you.

1235
01:14:00,534 --> 01:14:03,570
- Watch your step.
- Got it, honey.

1236
01:14:06,875 --> 01:14:09,108
- Hey.
- We're on the red-eye.

1237
01:14:09,109 --> 01:14:11,111
Does she know
where the guy lives?

1238
01:14:11,112 --> 01:14:14,147
Do you know where
Dave Greenberg lives?

1239
01:14:14,148 --> 01:14:18,551
I don't know, but he has to watch New
Jersey games at his cousin's bar.

1240
01:14:18,552 --> 01:14:22,221
They play tomorrow night.
He'll be there.

1241
01:14:22,222 --> 01:14:25,959
We'll see you
at the airport, Beth.

1242
01:14:25,960 --> 01:14:27,739
All right.

1243
01:14:38,739 --> 01:14:40,674
- Hey.
- Hey.

1244
01:14:40,675 --> 01:14:42,276
- Hi.
- Bethy.

1245
01:14:42,277 --> 01:14:43,296
Hey.

1246
01:15:02,296 --> 01:15:05,566
There's 8,000 David
Greenbergs in Long Island.

1247
01:15:05,567 --> 01:15:08,268
That's the name he's listed
under, if he's listed at all.

1248
01:15:08,269 --> 01:15:12,072
Why? Why would you
put all your money

1249
01:15:12,073 --> 01:15:13,774
into an account
that Rosie controls?

1250
01:15:13,775 --> 01:15:15,576
No shit, why?

1251
01:15:15,577 --> 01:15:17,712
Well, because it was
earning 11 percent interest.

1252
01:15:17,713 --> 01:15:19,912
Wow. Well,
that's a good reason.

1253
01:15:19,913 --> 01:15:22,216
- You must be Dink.
- Yeah. Jeremy, have a seat.

1254
01:15:22,217 --> 01:15:24,350
He's cute.

1255
01:15:24,351 --> 01:15:27,353
I'm sure you have a lot on
your mind right now, but...

1256
01:15:27,354 --> 01:15:30,624
- ...try not to worry.
- Why are you doing this?

1257
01:15:30,625 --> 01:15:32,593
We're just here
visiting family.

1258
01:15:32,594 --> 01:15:34,827
You already got a
felony conviction,

1259
01:15:34,828 --> 01:15:36,629
if this thing doesn't go down
nicely and you're anywhere near by,

1260
01:15:36,630 --> 01:15:38,000
you're going to go to prison for
a lot longer than we would.

1261
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:41,667
Well, then let's just stop.
Let's just give up, right now.

1262
01:15:41,668 --> 01:15:42,936
Anyway, we can't even
find Dave Greenberg...

1263
01:15:42,937 --> 01:15:45,037
I know Greenberg is.

1264
01:15:45,038 --> 01:15:47,174
- What?
- You do? Let me see, let me see.

1265
01:15:47,175 --> 01:15:50,611
Massa-fucking-pequa?
How did you...

1266
01:15:50,612 --> 01:15:52,612
I have access to a
government website at work,

1267
01:15:52,613 --> 01:15:54,681
and I can get in a lot of
trouble for showing you this,

1268
01:15:54,682 --> 01:15:57,751
but that's Greenberg. It's everything.
It's his home address,

1269
01:15:57,752 --> 01:16:00,953
property records, employment records,
phone numbers, family, everything.

1270
01:16:00,954 --> 01:16:03,188
I can never lay a hand on this douche, because
of my personal relationship with God,

1271
01:16:03,189 --> 01:16:05,124
but I know two guys about
four stops from here

1272
01:16:05,125 --> 01:16:07,192
who'll come and threaten to
saw his feet off for $900.

1273
01:16:07,193 --> 01:16:09,195
- Yes.
- If you're seriously considering doing something

1274
01:16:09,196 --> 01:16:11,062
like that, I'm going to
take the file and leave.

1275
01:16:11,063 --> 01:16:13,201
- Why, is he some kind of cop?
- No, he's a reporter.

1276
01:16:13,202 --> 01:16:15,836
Greenberg has a
felony conviction.

1277
01:16:15,837 --> 01:16:17,403
And he's on parole.

1278
01:16:17,404 --> 01:16:20,107
That's very bad.

1279
01:16:20,108 --> 01:16:22,076
We can't go anywhere
near this guy.

1280
01:16:22,077 --> 01:16:24,711
And if he's working
with the Feds,

1281
01:16:24,712 --> 01:16:27,280
we can't even walk on his lawn
without getting in trouble.

1282
01:16:31,252 --> 01:16:33,754
Thank you very much.
You can keep the change.

1283
01:16:33,755 --> 01:16:35,956
We have to go
back to the hotel.

1284
01:16:35,957 --> 01:16:38,125
You've got to call
this guy on the phone.

1285
01:16:38,126 --> 01:16:40,327
It's the only choice we have.

1286
01:16:40,328 --> 01:16:42,275
Come on.

1287
01:16:55,275 --> 01:16:57,978
You are going to have to
talk hard to these people.

1288
01:16:57,979 --> 01:16:59,945
- Yeah, I know.
- And you don't appreciate the parole officer,

1289
01:16:59,946 --> 01:17:01,714
don't call me,
I'll call you bullshit.

1290
01:17:01,715 --> 01:17:03,251
- I know.
- And whether or not his phone is tapped,

1291
01:17:03,252 --> 01:17:05,285
or not, tell him
you could care less...

1292
01:17:05,286 --> 01:17:06,886
I know, I know.

1293
01:17:06,887 --> 01:17:08,024
Where are you going?

1294
01:17:11,024 --> 01:17:12,726
Will you make sure
that I stay assertive?

1295
01:17:12,727 --> 01:17:17,363
Sure. I didn't expect Jeremy
to be such a normal guy.

1296
01:17:17,364 --> 01:17:19,700
I know, he's my first.

1297
01:17:19,701 --> 01:17:21,469
Do you think that's why I brought
him on the brink of federal prison?

1298
01:17:21,470 --> 01:17:24,071
Maybe.

1299
01:17:24,072 --> 01:17:27,109
Look, between Frankie and Dink,
it'll get handled, OK?

1300
01:17:29,109 --> 01:17:31,317
I'm the only one who can
deal with Dave Greenberg.

1301
01:17:42,323 --> 01:17:44,056
Dave!

1302
01:17:44,057 --> 01:17:46,796
It's Beth.

1303
01:17:48,796 --> 01:17:50,032
Beth,
you're calling me at home.

1304
01:17:51,032 --> 01:17:53,467
You know, we're having my
son's birthday party here.

1305
01:17:53,468 --> 01:17:57,269
What you're doing is the most scumbag
fucking thing you can do in this business.

1306
01:17:57,270 --> 01:18:00,439
You and your buddies
win five weeks in a row,

1307
01:18:00,440 --> 01:18:03,109
and get paid the exact
amount on time,

1308
01:18:03,110 --> 01:18:05,911
and now,
the first time you lose,

1309
01:18:05,912 --> 01:18:08,215
you turn your cell phones off?!

1310
01:18:08,216 --> 01:18:10,450
I'll call you back
in five minutes.

1311
01:18:10,451 --> 01:18:12,926
Four minutes!

1312
01:18:18,926 --> 01:18:21,393
Get off the money thing.
Get back on the Fed thing,

1313
01:18:21,394 --> 01:18:22,896
it's the only thing
we really care about.

1314
01:18:22,897 --> 01:18:26,233
He's scared.
I can taste it.

1315
01:18:26,234 --> 01:18:28,505
I'm going to make him more
scared of me than the Feds.

1316
01:18:30,505 --> 01:18:32,426
I got this.

1317
01:19:01,802 --> 01:19:03,435
- Dave.
- Beth.

1318
01:19:03,436 --> 01:19:05,205
My phone line are still tapped,

1319
01:19:05,206 --> 01:19:06,007
I'm calling you
from the neighbors.

1320
01:19:07,007 --> 01:19:08,575
Dave, stop lying
to me right now.

1321
01:19:08,576 --> 01:19:10,411
I don't believe a word that's
coming out of your mouth.

1322
01:19:10,412 --> 01:19:12,144
You owe me $75,000.

1323
01:19:12,145 --> 01:19:13,979
Hey!

1324
01:19:13,980 --> 01:19:17,216
Hey, I owe you $10,000.

1325
01:19:17,217 --> 01:19:20,086
Whatever the other guys lost,
whatever they're not paying you,

1326
01:19:20,087 --> 01:19:22,988
I am not responsible. If you want,
I'll give you their numbers.

1327
01:19:22,989 --> 01:19:25,224
Oh, I have all the
numbers I need, Dave.

1328
01:19:25,225 --> 01:19:26,028
I have your
boss's phone number,

1329
01:19:27,028 --> 01:19:28,429
I have your
sister's phone number,

1330
01:19:28,430 --> 01:19:32,832
I have your wife's parents
numbers in Great Neck.

1331
01:19:32,833 --> 01:19:35,100
And if you don't stop
fucking with me,

1332
01:19:35,101 --> 01:19:38,537
I will call each one of them and
tell them what a degenerate you are.

1333
01:19:38,538 --> 01:19:40,474
Christ, where do you get off
calling me a degenerate?

1334
01:19:40,475 --> 01:19:44,044
Dave, Dave, do you think
I'm just some idiot

1335
01:19:44,045 --> 01:19:47,880
running around the street all day, handing
out thousands of dollars in credit limits?

1336
01:19:47,881 --> 01:19:50,216
Is that what you
fucking think I am?!

1337
01:19:50,217 --> 01:19:53,185
You don't think that
I work for someone?

1338
01:19:53,186 --> 01:19:56,288
Someone who can find out
anything about you,

1339
01:19:56,289 --> 01:19:58,390
do anything to you.

1340
01:19:58,391 --> 01:20:00,926
Do you really want
to play that guy?

1341
01:20:00,927 --> 01:20:05,369
Dave, it's because of me that
you can still walk right now.

1342
01:20:09,369 --> 01:20:13,239
Beth, I told you. I have a
parole officer that is on...

1343
01:20:13,240 --> 01:20:16,443
Even if you do have
a parole officer,

1344
01:20:16,444 --> 01:20:18,411
he is not my problem.

1345
01:20:18,412 --> 01:20:21,247
I don't think you get
what's going on here.

1346
01:20:21,248 --> 01:20:25,387
Dave, listen to me. Look me
in the eye over the phone.

1347
01:20:27,387 --> 01:20:30,658
You're an adult.

1348
01:20:31,658 --> 01:20:34,296
And you make decisions.

1349
01:20:36,296 --> 01:20:39,165
And those decisions
have consequences,

1350
01:20:39,166 --> 01:20:42,434
for you and
for people around you.

1351
01:20:42,435 --> 01:20:45,237
When you put your money down,

1352
01:20:45,238 --> 01:20:50,179
you cannot pick and choose which of
your bets count and which ones don't.

1353
01:20:52,179 --> 01:20:55,317
'Cause all of your
bets are yours.

1354
01:20:56,317 --> 01:20:58,417
All of them.

1355
01:20:58,418 --> 01:21:01,358
Win or lose.

1356
01:21:04,358 --> 01:21:05,429
Dave?

1357
01:21:08,429 --> 01:21:09,533
Dave?

1358
01:21:19,105 --> 01:21:22,211
Dave?

1359
01:21:24,211 --> 01:21:27,349
You, you're right.

1360
01:21:28,349 --> 01:21:32,618
You're right, but I can't...

1361
01:21:32,619 --> 01:21:35,489
I can't pay.

1362
01:21:36,489 --> 01:21:37,991
I don't have the money.

1363
01:21:37,992 --> 01:21:41,961
He's crying.
I feel bad.

1364
01:21:41,962 --> 01:21:44,567
No. Go, go, go...

1365
01:21:46,567 --> 01:21:49,402
Dave, be completely honest
with me about the Fed thing

1366
01:21:49,403 --> 01:21:52,237
and the parole officer,
right now...

1367
01:21:52,238 --> 01:21:55,241
...and I will knock
$10,000 off the debt.

1368
01:21:55,242 --> 01:21:57,518
This is a one time only offer.

1369
01:22:04,518 --> 01:22:09,229
I have a parole officer.
That's the truth.

1370
01:22:16,229 --> 01:22:20,032
But he doesn't know
anything about you.

1371
01:22:20,033 --> 01:22:23,336
That Fed thing,
that's bullshit.

1372
01:22:23,337 --> 01:22:25,772
That's what I thought.

1373
01:22:25,773 --> 01:22:31,344
OK. So, now we're done with the
games and you only owe me $65,000.

1374
01:22:31,345 --> 01:22:33,645
So, how are we going
to work this out?

1375
01:22:33,646 --> 01:22:35,515
Do I have to call all your
relatives or have somebody come

1376
01:22:35,516 --> 01:22:37,716
and punch a fucking
sunroof into your head?!

1377
01:22:37,717 --> 01:22:39,055
Whoa, whoa, whoa...

1378
01:22:41,055 --> 01:22:43,122
The only way you're
going to get your money,

1379
01:22:43,123 --> 01:22:45,027
is if you reopen my account.

1380
01:22:46,027 --> 01:22:50,095
I want to take
New Jersey tonight to win

1381
01:22:50,096 --> 01:22:52,564
for $20,000. It is a lock.

1382
01:22:52,565 --> 01:22:55,501
Now, if I win,

1383
01:22:55,502 --> 01:22:58,604
that's $40,000,
and you can have all of it.

1384
01:22:58,605 --> 01:23:00,572
Take it or leave it.

1385
01:23:00,573 --> 01:23:02,809
- What?
- Please hold.

1386
01:23:02,810 --> 01:23:06,145
What are you doing? Just let it go.
It's Rosie's money.

1387
01:23:06,146 --> 01:23:08,515
No, no, no. Look, if I
don't get Rosie his money,

1388
01:23:08,516 --> 01:23:10,250
he won't give me my money.

1389
01:23:10,251 --> 01:23:12,419
If I hang up now,
I lose everything.

1390
01:23:12,420 --> 01:23:15,688
If Dave loses,
I still lose everything.

1391
01:23:15,689 --> 01:23:17,659
But if Dave wins...

1392
01:23:19,659 --> 01:23:23,228
I see your logic,
but New Jersey?

1393
01:23:23,229 --> 01:23:27,200
- New Jersey...
- Wait, if Dave wins will Rosie give me my money?

1394
01:23:27,201 --> 01:23:30,739
Yeah, Rosie's a scumbag,
he's not a thief.

1395
01:23:32,739 --> 01:23:35,742
OK, I'll do it.

1396
01:23:35,743 --> 01:23:37,677
If I can put you
down for $40,000,

1397
01:23:37,678 --> 01:23:39,746
that way you win 80,
and we're even.

1398
01:23:39,747 --> 01:23:43,383
If I win, that makes me up 15.

1399
01:23:43,384 --> 01:23:44,784
I don't think you're
very good at math.

1400
01:23:44,785 --> 01:23:47,554
Oh no, I'm good at math.

1401
01:23:47,555 --> 01:23:50,322
And I'm even better at
dealing with degenerates.

1402
01:23:50,323 --> 01:23:54,260
That $15,000 goes to me for putting
up with your amateur bullshit.

1403
01:23:54,261 --> 01:23:58,802
And you're in the clear.
Take it or leave it.

1404
01:24:02,802 --> 01:24:04,841
I'll take it.

1405
01:24:06,841 --> 01:24:08,543
New Jersey.

1406
01:24:10,543 --> 01:24:13,278
New Jersey,
desperately trying to hang on

1407
01:24:13,279 --> 01:24:15,483
for the upset win
over Los Angeles.

1408
01:24:15,484 --> 01:24:18,318
96-95!

1409
01:24:18,319 --> 01:24:21,286
New Jersey has to
play better defense.

1410
01:24:21,287 --> 01:24:24,456
For New Jersey they have
played hard all night long!

1411
01:24:24,457 --> 01:24:27,426
Now their lead down to one,
and it is gone...

1412
01:24:27,427 --> 01:24:29,863
I can't believe it,
you're kidding me!

1413
01:24:32,666 --> 01:24:34,367
I can't take this.

1414
01:24:34,368 --> 01:24:36,337
Again, a lack of
defense transition.

1415
01:24:36,338 --> 01:24:40,506
You've got to slow
down the basketball.

1416
01:24:40,507 --> 01:24:45,545
Los Angeles with a
97-96 lead over New Jersey!

1417
01:24:45,546 --> 01:24:48,413
What are you doing?
Come back and watch!

1418
01:24:48,414 --> 01:24:50,617
This is the part
I just can't watch.

1419
01:24:50,618 --> 01:24:52,752
I'd rather sit alone in a dark room
for three hours with the phone off

1420
01:24:52,753 --> 01:24:56,194
- after a game.
- Yeah, when you have money on it.

1421
01:25:01,194 --> 01:25:03,295
You have money on this game?

1422
01:25:03,296 --> 01:25:06,166
- Mm-hm.
- You bet against me?

1423
01:25:06,167 --> 01:25:10,370
No. Bet $70,000 on New Jersey
to win the game out right.

1424
01:25:10,371 --> 01:25:11,737
- Who with?
- Rosie.

1425
01:25:11,738 --> 01:25:13,273
- Oh, my God...
- My God...

1426
01:25:13,274 --> 01:25:16,809
Why would you do that?
Why?

1427
01:25:16,810 --> 01:25:19,245
I don't know.

1428
01:25:19,246 --> 01:25:21,848
You can't bet sentimentally.

1429
01:25:21,849 --> 01:25:24,653
You taught me that.

1430
01:25:25,653 --> 01:25:28,254
Here you
see Reedmore in the act,

1431
01:25:28,255 --> 01:25:30,857
get stripped and put him at
the free throw line

1432
01:25:30,858 --> 01:25:34,493
and two main free throws, can
win this game for New Jersey.

1433
01:25:34,494 --> 01:25:36,261
Reedmore just got fouled!

1434
01:25:36,262 --> 01:25:39,499
Come on! Come on, come on!
Come on!

1435
01:25:39,500 --> 01:25:41,969
Making the play
late in the game.

1436
01:25:41,970 --> 01:25:44,571
Come on, we've got
to watch this now.

1437
01:25:44,572 --> 01:25:46,471
Come on, come on.
Watch.

1438
01:25:46,472 --> 01:25:48,374
Look, he's gonna get this in.

1439
01:25:48,375 --> 01:25:51,510
Sucks. I just want you to be
prepared if he doesn't...

1440
01:25:51,511 --> 01:25:53,845
- Watch, watch...
- ...make it.

1441
01:25:53,846 --> 01:25:56,448
...and at least try
and force overtime.

1442
01:25:56,449 --> 01:25:58,850
Reedmore's first...

1443
01:25:58,851 --> 01:26:02,822
Yes!

1444
01:26:02,823 --> 01:26:06,826
New Jersey, they've had
such a difficult year...

1445
01:26:06,827 --> 01:26:08,661
OK, OK, now make
the second one.

1446
01:26:08,662 --> 01:26:10,898
- I'm going to go sit down.
- No. Dink, you stay here.

1447
01:26:10,899 --> 01:26:12,497
They're going to make both.

1448
01:26:12,498 --> 01:26:13,900
You've got to protect yourself.

1449
01:26:13,901 --> 01:26:15,734
No, I know he's
going to make it.

1450
01:26:15,735 --> 01:26:17,270
- I know.
- Can't think like that.

1451
01:26:17,271 --> 01:26:19,471
Because I deserve this.

1452
01:26:19,472 --> 01:26:22,010
- Can't think like that.
- Dink. I have to think like that.

1453
01:26:23,010 --> 01:26:26,545
The chance to put them on
his shoulders and win it.

1454
01:26:26,546 --> 01:26:30,250
To cap off this
miraculous upset,

1455
01:26:30,251 --> 01:26:33,752
New Jersey playing
from in front.

1456
01:26:33,753 --> 01:26:37,590
Wait for it.
Wait for it.

1457
01:26:37,591 --> 01:26:39,597
We're doomed.

1458
01:27:01,547 --> 01:27:03,616
One, two, three...

1459
01:27:03,617 --> 01:27:06,552
# Well I heard about the girl
you've been dancing with #

1460
01:27:06,553 --> 01:27:09,488
# All over the neighborhood #

1461
01:27:09,489 --> 01:27:12,558
# Tell me why
didn't you ask me baby #

1462
01:27:12,559 --> 01:27:15,060
# Or didn't you think I could #

1463
01:27:15,061 --> 01:27:18,363
# Well I know that your
partner won't stop aside #

1464
01:27:18,364 --> 01:27:20,966
# I've seen her with
the jerk all night #

1465
01:27:20,967 --> 01:27:23,003
# Why didn't you ask me baby #

1466
01:27:24,003 --> 01:27:26,805
# I would've shown you
how to do it right #

1467
01:27:26,806 --> 01:27:29,575
# Yeah, do it right #

1468
01:27:29,576 --> 01:27:32,844
- Ah ha...
- # Do it right #

1469
01:27:32,845 --> 01:27:37,617
# Yeah Do it right #

1470
01:27:37,618 --> 01:27:41,787
- Ahh...
- # Twisting #
