00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,791
[both scream]

349
00:19:04,166 --> 00:19:06,333
Mission accomplished,
little bro.

350
00:19:07,083 --> 00:19:08,875
[door closing]

351
00:19:12,333 --> 00:19:13,583
[car approaches]

352
00:19:16,166 --> 00:19:18,333
[both screaming]

353
00:19:25,750 --> 00:19:28,583
It's permanent ink! This
is never coming off!

354
00:19:28,666 --> 00:19:29,666
Um... [gasps]

355
00:19:29,750 --> 00:19:31,166
We need another door!

356
00:19:31,250 --> 00:19:34,375
Another door? Where are
we gonna get another door?

357
00:19:34,458 --> 00:19:37,416
[gasps] The basement! Go,
go, go, go, go, go, go!

358
00:19:47,625 --> 00:19:49,583
[groans]

359
00:19:49,666 --> 00:19:51,625
Oh, let's hurry up
and get you inside.

360
00:19:53,958 --> 00:19:55,375
[grunts] Quit pushing!

361
00:19:55,458 --> 00:19:57,458
Quit pulling! Push!

362
00:19:57,541 --> 00:19:58,750
I said pull!

363
00:19:58,833 --> 00:19:59,833
Ow!

364
00:20:00,375 --> 00:20:02,208
[groans]

365
00:20:02,291 --> 00:20:03,708
Come on, Frank.

366
00:20:14,333 --> 00:20:15,458
Boys?

367
00:20:18,541 --> 00:20:19,708
We're home!

368
00:20:19,791 --> 00:20:21,583
Oh. Hey, Mom!

369
00:20:22,666 --> 00:20:26,083
So, did you guys do some brotherly
bonding while we were gone?

370
00:20:26,166 --> 00:20:27,916
Uh, kinda, I guess.

371
00:20:28,625 --> 00:20:30,666
Rodrick, y-you're sweating!

372
00:20:31,291 --> 00:20:33,958
Oh, I hope you don't
have what Manny has.

373
00:20:34,041 --> 00:20:35,458
[Frank] I knew it, Susan!

374
00:20:35,958 --> 00:20:38,166
I knew they couldn't be trusted!

375
00:20:38,250 --> 00:20:40,041
They didn't empty
the dishwasher.

376
00:20:40,125 --> 00:20:42,166
[Manny gags, vomits]

377
00:20:42,666 --> 00:20:44,916
- [Frank] Oh, that's gross.
- [Manny] Manny all better!

378
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,000
[sighs]

379
00:20:46,083 --> 00:20:47,291
[sighs]

380
00:20:47,375 --> 00:20:48,833
[sighs]

381
00:20:57,125 --> 00:20:58,333
[chuckling]

382
00:20:58,416 --> 00:20:59,416
[phone beeping]

383
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:01,583
[laughing] Oh.

384
00:21:01,666 --> 00:21:03,166
Oh, man!

385
00:21:05,333 --> 00:21:06,458
Hmm.

386
00:21:06,958 --> 00:21:12,125
[sniffs] There's gotta be
evidence. They're not that smart.

387
00:21:13,291 --> 00:21:14,291
Aha!

388
00:21:14,958 --> 00:21:16,083
[groans]

389
00:21:19,333 --> 00:21:20,833
[laughs]

390
00:21:22,291 --> 00:21:23,416
[screams]

391
00:21:25,875 --> 00:21:26,875
[chuckles]

392
00:21:31,291 --> 00:21:33,916
You think he knows?
I... I think he knows!

393
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,416
Shh! Keep your
voice down, dummy.

394
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:39,000
If he doesn't know, he's
gonna figure it out.

395
00:21:39,083 --> 00:21:42,166
I mean, he's been sniffing around
the house ever since he got back.

396
00:21:42,250 --> 00:21:43,916
He's gonna find something.

397
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:48,625
You need to calm down. We covered
our tracks. We cleaned up the place.

398
00:21:48,708 --> 00:21:50,500
Yeah, and you owe me for that.

399
00:21:50,583 --> 00:21:53,583
And you can start paying me back
by finishing with these leaves!

400
00:21:53,666 --> 00:21:57,041
Wait, wait, wait. What...
What is this about owing you?

401
00:21:57,125 --> 00:21:59,583
I don't remember saying
anything like that.

402
00:22:00,583 --> 00:22:04,666
Are you kidding me? I cleaned up your
stupid party, and that wasn't easy!

403
00:22:04,750 --> 00:22:09,708
Don't you mean our party? We
were partners in this thing.

404
00:22:09,791 --> 00:22:11,958
That mess was our mess,

405
00:22:12,041 --> 00:22:15,916
and if Mom and Dad ever find out
about it, we're both in hot water.

406
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,500
No way! This was your party!

407
00:22:18,583 --> 00:22:21,041
You're the one who's
getting in trouble, not me!

408
00:22:21,125 --> 00:22:23,666
I'm gonna tell Mom and
Dad what really happened.

409
00:22:26,750 --> 00:22:30,791
Fine, fine. I'll pay up.

410
00:22:31,625 --> 00:22:33,708
Yeah? And how are
you gonna do that?

411
00:22:34,416 --> 00:22:38,500
By giving you my most
valuable possession.

412
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,625
What? Mom Bucks?

413
00:22:40,708 --> 00:22:43,333
No, thanks. I've seen
where you keep them.

414
00:22:43,416 --> 00:22:48,000
Something even better
than that. Knowledge.

415
00:22:48,083 --> 00:22:50,000
[scoffs] I've seen
your report card.

416
00:22:50,083 --> 00:22:55,625
Not school knowledge. Real knowledge.
Stuff you can actually use.

417
00:22:55,708 --> 00:22:56,958
I'm listening.

418
00:22:57,041 --> 00:22:59,000
I'll give you a little taste.

419
00:22:59,083 --> 00:23:01,250
Let's start with the
way you bag your leaves.

420
00:23:01,333 --> 00:23:05,166
When you do it, you fill your bag
to the top and then tie it shut.

421
00:23:05,250 --> 00:23:07,041
But that's not smart.

422
00:23:07,125 --> 00:23:09,708
Mom's paying three
Mom Bucks a bag.

423
00:23:09,791 --> 00:23:13,875
So, if you wanna maximize your
income, you've gotta do it like this.

424
00:23:17,916 --> 00:23:20,083
But isn't that cheating?

425
00:23:20,166 --> 00:23:23,166
It's not cheating. It's
just gaming the system.

426
00:23:23,875 --> 00:23:26,541
So, what? You're just gonna give
me a bunch of yard work tips?

427
00:23:26,625 --> 00:23:28,916
I can teach you lots of
things, little brother.

428
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:32,166
Stuff that'll make
your whole life easier.

429
00:23:32,250 --> 00:23:34,625
Your problem is that
you work too hard.

430
00:23:34,708 --> 00:23:37,500
I want that underwear
off the table

431
00:23:37,583 --> 00:23:39,833
by the time I get back
from the grocery store.

432
00:23:39,916 --> 00:23:42,791
- [door closes]
- [Rodrick] <i>What you do is set the bar low,</i>

433
00:23:42,875 --> 00:23:45,000
<i>so Mom and Dad don't
expect too much out of you.</i>

434
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:46,833
<i>Because then…</i>

435
00:23:48,375 --> 00:23:49,375
Wha...

436
00:23:49,458 --> 00:23:52,541
[Rodrick] <i>…they're happy when you
do practically nothing at all.</i>

437

00:23:54,208 --> 00:23:56,000
<i>Pretend you don't
know how to do stuff,</i>

439
00:23:56,083 --> 00:23:58,708

of a lot of unnecessary work.</i>

440

441
00:24:01,750 --> 00:24:04,333
H… Hmm.

442
00:24:05,375 --> 00:24:06,875
I'll just do it, okay?

443
00:24:07,791 --> 00:24:09,583
[typing]

444
00:24:09,666 --> 00:24:12,500

don't feel like doing something,</i>

446
00:24:15,625 --> 00:24:16,958
I'm ready to start!

447
00:24:17,041 --> 00:24:18,541
I just finished.

448
00:24:19,041 --> 00:24:21,208
My body is on a schedule.

449
00:24:21,833 --> 00:24:23,083
[groans]

450
00:24:23,958 --> 00:24:27,125
Okay, I'll admit it.
That's... That's pretty good.

451
00:24:27,208 --> 00:24:28,333
What else can you teach me?

452
00:24:28,416 --> 00:24:33,125
Oh, I've got loads of stuff like
that. I call it my Rodrick Rules.

453
00:24:34,333 --> 00:24:36,791
Don't you mean
"Rodrick's Rules"?

454
00:24:36,875 --> 00:24:41,791
No, Rodrick Rules. There's
only one Rodrick, me.

455
00:24:41,875 --> 00:24:42,750
[sighs] Yeah.

456
00:24:42,833 --> 00:24:45,291
I meant, like, apostrophe S.

457
00:24:45,375 --> 00:24:49,375
Rodrick Rule number one. No
apostrophes or any other nerd stuff.

458
00:24:50,416 --> 00:24:53,041
That kinda stuff will get
you beat up at school.

459
00:24:53,125 --> 00:24:54,583
So, what's rule number two?

460
00:24:54,666 --> 00:24:57,541
Uh, I've already
given away too much.

461
00:24:57,625 --> 00:25:01,625
If you want more, we're gonna
have to make this deal official.

462
00:25:02,125 --> 00:25:07,333
You keep your mouth shut about the party,
and I'll tell you everything I know.

463
00:25:08,458 --> 00:25:09,458
Deal.

464
00:25:23,875 --> 00:25:27,291
Greg, Rowley's here! Time to go!

465
00:25:28,458 --> 00:25:32,250
Hello, Rowley. Don't
you look handsome?

466
00:25:32,333 --> 00:25:33,333
[gulps]

467
00:25:33,416 --> 00:25:39,041
Um, this weekend I had tap-dancing
lessons with Miss Tilly. [chuckles]

468
00:25:39,125 --> 00:25:41,833
Uh, nothing out of
the ordinary happened.

469
00:25:42,833 --> 00:25:45,125
[chuckling]

470
00:25:46,875 --> 00:25:48,500
- [parents gasp]
- Whoa. Hey, Rowley!

471
00:25:48,583 --> 00:25:51,791
It's been a while.
Friday afternoon, right?

472
00:25:51,875 --> 00:25:52,916
Yeah, we...

473
00:25:53,416 --> 00:25:57,333
- Whoa! So clean.
- Uh… [chuckles]

474
00:25:57,416 --> 00:26:00,708
Yeah, yeah. Time to go, Rowley!
Time... Time to go. Get out.

475
00:26:02,458 --> 00:26:04,666
Come on, Rowley. Two
more seconds in there,

476
00:26:04,750 --> 00:26:06,990
and you were gonna spill your
guts about the whole party.

477
00:26:07,041 --> 00:26:10,333
Sorry, I'm not
good at this stuff.

478
00:26:10,416 --> 00:26:12,833
You don't think my dad
heard you back there, right?

479
00:26:12,916 --> 00:26:15,416
'Cause he's been acting
really suspicious.

480
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:17,833
How did you get the
house so clean, though?

481
00:26:18,333 --> 00:26:21,416
Um, me and Rodrick
actually did it together.

482
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:23,375
I told you, me and
him are a team.

483
00:26:23,458 --> 00:26:26,791
[shouts] You and Rodrick? But
he locked us in the basement!

484
00:26:26,875 --> 00:26:30,458
Uh, yeah. Brothers just
joke like that. [chuckles]

485
00:26:30,541 --> 00:26:33,291
It's actually pretty hilarious
if you really think about it.

486
00:26:34,708 --> 00:26:35,958
Don't look at me like that.

487
00:26:36,875 --> 00:26:40,000
Anyway, yeah, Rodrick's been, uh...
He's been taking me under his wing.

488
00:26:40,083 --> 00:26:41,958
He's been teaching
me a bunch of stuff.

489
00:26:42,458 --> 00:26:44,500
Really? What kind of stuff?

490
00:26:44,583 --> 00:26:47,000
Uh, like, how you need
to set the bar low,

491
00:26:47,083 --> 00:26:49,041
so your parents don't
expect too much from you.

492
00:26:49,125 --> 00:26:52,250
Oh, and how you can trick them into
helping you with your homework.

493
00:26:52,333 --> 00:26:53,625
That kind of thing.

494
00:26:54,333 --> 00:26:56,750
That seems like bad stuff.

495
00:26:56,833 --> 00:26:59,083
This information is
like gold, Rowley!

496
00:26:59,166 --> 00:27:01,291
It's what makes having an
older brother worth it.

497
00:27:03,375 --> 00:27:06,208
But why is Rodrick being so
nice to you all of a sudden?

498
00:27:08,375 --> 00:27:11,666
I don't know. Maybe 'cause he
just likes having me around.

499
00:27:11,750 --> 00:27:14,666
You know what? You wouldn't
understand. You're an only child.

500
00:27:14,750 --> 00:27:15,750
No offense.

501
00:27:16,416 --> 00:27:23,166
Well, I'm glad I'm an only child. 'Cause
this brother stuff is complicated.

Lacrimosa" playing]

Rodrick!

508
00:28:05,125 --> 00:28:06,375
What?

509
00:28:06,458 --> 00:28:10,875
You need to teach me something new.
You never got past rule number one.

510
00:28:10,958 --> 00:28:14,250
You only get one rule a week.
That's Rodrick Rule number two.

[rim shot]

512
00:28:15,750 --> 00:28:18,333
What? That's not fair.

513
00:28:18,416 --> 00:28:19,833
Life's not fair.

514
00:28:21,833 --> 00:28:24,583
Rule number three. And now you
made me break rule number two.

515
00:28:24,666 --> 00:28:26,458
[sighs] Fine.

516
00:28:28,041 --> 00:28:29,250
Ow! What the...

517
00:28:29,333 --> 00:28:31,250
I've been looking for that.

518
00:28:31,333 --> 00:28:32,333

about you teach me something for real?

Maybe you could teach me how
to play the drums or something.

Okay, now loosen up that wrist a bit.
Keep it flowing. Feel the rhythm.

00:37:09,458 --> 00:37:11,750
[elderly person] Hi, Merle!
Going to bingo tonight?

690
00:37:11,833 --> 00:37:13,583
[Merle] I wouldn't
miss it for the world.

691
00:37:13,666 --> 00:37:16,708
[elderly person] Well, you can
kiss your winning streak goodbye.

692
00:37:16,791 --> 00:37:18,958
I'm bringing a good
luck charm with me.

693
00:37:19,041 --> 00:37:21,541
- [squeaks]
- Oh! Isn't he cute?

694
00:37:21,625 --> 00:37:25,291
Merle, Irene, bingo tonight?

695
00:37:25,375 --> 00:37:26,708
Ha! We'll see.

696
00:37:26,791 --> 00:37:32,500
Can you believe my luck last
week? Two games in a row.

697
00:37:32,583 --> 00:37:36,833
It was all thanks
to my lucky charm.

698
00:37:36,916 --> 00:37:38,083
[squeaks]

699
00:37:38,166 --> 00:37:39,916
[whimpers]

700
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,208
[flushes]

701
00:37:41,291 --> 00:37:42,375
[shouts]

702
00:37:48,333 --> 00:37:50,083
Say…

703
00:37:50,166 --> 00:37:52,208
"Boys size small?"

704
00:37:52,291 --> 00:37:54,375
[gasps] A Peeping Tom!

705
00:37:54,458 --> 00:37:55,458
[shouts]

706
00:37:58,583 --> 00:38:02,083
We see you in there,
Boy Size Small!

707
00:38:02,166 --> 00:38:05,000
[Irene] We're gonna hand
you over to the authorities!

708
00:38:05,083 --> 00:38:07,208
[Merle] They'll put
you in the slammer!

709
00:38:10,750 --> 00:38:13,208
- [Irene] Where did he go?
- [elderly person] I don't see him.

710
00:38:13,291 --> 00:38:14,708
[Irene] Did he give us the slip?

711
00:38:14,791 --> 00:38:15,666
[squeaks]

712
00:38:15,750 --> 00:38:16,875
[shouts]

713
00:38:16,958 --> 00:38:18,125
- [screams]
- There he is!

714
00:38:18,208 --> 00:38:20,291
He's on the move, ladies!

715
00:38:21,875 --> 00:38:25,166
[laughing]

716
00:38:26,708 --> 00:38:27,875
[grunts]

717
00:38:27,958 --> 00:38:30,083
[shouting]

718
00:38:30,166 --> 00:38:31,250
After him!

719
00:38:31,750 --> 00:38:32,625
[alarm sounds]

720
00:38:32,708 --> 00:38:34,916
- Huh? Huh?
- [grunts]

721
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,375
- We're coming through!
- Hey! Watch it!

722
00:38:37,458 --> 00:38:39,541
- Don't let him get away!
- [panting]

723
00:38:42,291 --> 00:38:43,666
[ladies muttering]

724
00:38:43,750 --> 00:38:45,166
[sighs]

725
00:38:45,250 --> 00:38:47,208
- [yelps]
- You get out of here!

726
00:38:47,291 --> 00:38:48,291
- [shouts]
- [chattering]

727
00:38:48,375 --> 00:38:50,000
[elderly person]
Killing my bingo buzz!

728
00:38:50,083 --> 00:38:51,750
[Irene] There he is!

729
00:38:51,833 --> 00:38:53,416
There's Boy Size Small.

730
00:38:56,166 --> 00:38:59,041
- Come back here! We're gonna get you!
- Yeah! Yeah!

731
00:39:00,583 --> 00:39:01,583
There he is! Come on!

732
00:39:01,666 --> 00:39:02,958
- [shouts]
- [guard] Hey, kid!

733
00:39:03,041 --> 00:39:05,000
- Come back here!
- Come on. Wait!

734
00:39:05,083 --> 00:39:06,309
- Out of my way!
- Hey! Get off!

735
00:39:06,333 --> 00:39:07,750
Where do you think you're going?

736
00:39:08,583 --> 00:39:09,583
[panting]

737
00:39:09,666 --> 00:39:10,666
[gasps]

738
00:39:11,166 --> 00:39:13,458
Hmm, what do we have here?

739
00:39:14,583 --> 00:39:16,375
- Oh!
- Uh…

740
00:39:18,791 --> 00:39:19,791
That's nasty.

741
00:39:21,750 --> 00:39:23,083
- [gasps]
- All right!

742
00:39:23,666 --> 00:39:25,333
- Hey!
- There he goes! This way!

743
00:39:25,833 --> 00:39:26,833
D'oh!

744
00:39:27,416 --> 00:39:28,750
Come here!

745
00:39:30,875 --> 00:39:32,250
[groans]

746
00:39:37,375 --> 00:39:39,791
I could've sworn
he went this way.

747
00:39:39,875 --> 00:39:41,291
Where is he?

748
00:39:41,375 --> 00:39:43,083
He gave us the slip.

749
00:39:45,416 --> 00:39:46,583
[sighs]

750
00:39:50,291 --> 00:39:52,916
[Greg narrating] <i>Somehow, I managed
to get back to Grandpa's room.</i>

751
00:39:54,250 --> 00:40:00,833
<i>But Rodrick can never find out about
this. 'Cause if he does, I'm a dead man.</i>

752
00:40:00,916 --> 00:40:03,833
You're in big
trouble, young man.

753
00:40:03,916 --> 00:40:05,416
[whimpers]

754
00:40:07,916 --> 00:40:10,250
Rodrick just rolled a 12!

755
00:40:13,875 --> 00:40:15,125
[chuckling]

756
00:40:15,208 --> 00:40:18,458
That means you've gotta
fork over half your cards.

757
00:40:19,416 --> 00:40:23,000
Come on, snake eyes!

758
00:40:25,458 --> 00:40:30,041
Put some pants on,
for the love of Pete.

759
00:40:30,125 --> 00:40:31,500
[chuckles]

760
00:40:31,583 --> 00:40:34,083
Is there something you want
to tell me, little brother?

761
00:40:34,666 --> 00:40:35,666
[gulps]

762
00:40:42,375 --> 00:40:44,833
[snoring]

763
00:40:47,666 --> 00:40:48,791
[sighs]

764
00:40:48,875 --> 00:40:49,875
<i>Open up!</i>

765
00:40:49,958 --> 00:40:52,208
[snores]

766
00:40:52,291 --> 00:40:54,666
[grunting]

767
00:40:54,750 --> 00:40:58,125
[gasps] Grandpa, can we... Can
we please change the channel?

768
00:40:58,208 --> 00:41:01,041
There's nothing but a
bunch of garbage on TV.

769
00:41:01,916 --> 00:41:03,916
I like to watch
people come and go.

770
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,416
<i>Ooh! Hot in there.</i>

771
00:41:05,500 --> 00:41:06,958
[Grandpa] Barry Grossman!

772
00:41:07,625 --> 00:41:10,375
You've got time to sit in
the sauna for two hours,

773
00:41:10,875 --> 00:41:14,958
but you can't bother yourself
to return my vacuum cleaner!

774
00:41:15,041 --> 00:41:16,208
[laughs]

775
00:41:16,291 --> 00:41:20,208
Bah, fine! You can
have the clicker.

776
00:41:21,916 --> 00:41:25,791
<i>And in some disturbing
news, earlier this evening,</i>

777
00:41:25,875 --> 00:41:29,500
<i>a Peeping Tom was spotted in the
women's bathroom at Leisure...</i>

778
00:41:29,583 --> 00:41:30,583
[button clicking]

779
00:41:30,666 --> 00:41:32,416
[snores]

780
00:41:33,416 --> 00:41:34,833
[door opens]

781
00:41:35,916 --> 00:41:36,916
[shouts]

782
00:41:38,166 --> 00:41:41,583
You're jumpy tonight. Mind you
don't wake up your brother.

783
00:41:41,666 --> 00:41:45,458
Oh, yeah. You're right, Grandpa.
There's... There's nothing good on TV.

784
00:41:45,541 --> 00:41:47,416
Ha! Told you so.

785
00:41:47,500 --> 00:41:53,416
[sighs] You know, Greg, I
might be old, but I'm no fool.

786
00:41:53,500 --> 00:41:55,083
I know what's really going on.

787
00:41:56,666 --> 00:41:57,666
You do?

788
00:41:57,750 --> 00:42:01,041
You and your brother aren't here
because you want to be here.

789
00:42:01,541 --> 00:42:03,708
Your parents made you come.

790
00:42:03,791 --> 00:42:06,958
That's not true. Grandpa,
we wanted to come here.

791
00:42:07,041 --> 00:42:09,000
[laughs]

792
00:42:09,083 --> 00:42:14,208
No boys your age would choose to spend
the weekend with an old codger like me.

793
00:42:14,291 --> 00:42:17,458
Ha! Yeah, well,
I'll tell you this.

794
00:42:17,541 --> 00:42:21,583
I've enjoyed every second
of it. You're good boys.

795
00:42:24,083 --> 00:42:25,083
I guess.

796
00:42:25,166 --> 00:42:30,500
I know you boys love each other,
because you spend time together.

797
00:42:31,791 --> 00:42:36,500
It wasn't always that
way with my boys.

798
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:39,375
And now they've grown apart.

799
00:42:39,458 --> 00:42:42,125
They don't even spend
the holidays together.

800
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:46,250
I just wish they'd worked
things out when they were young.

801
00:42:47,166 --> 00:42:49,000
Like you and Rodrick have.

802
00:42:49,875 --> 00:42:52,041
Maybe things would
be different now.

803
00:42:54,250 --> 00:42:55,250
[Greg] Yeah.

804
00:43:01,625 --> 00:43:02,708
[doorbell rings]

805
00:43:06,583 --> 00:43:07,625
Hey, Greg.

806
00:43:09,583 --> 00:43:12,000
Rowley, I told you
not to wear stripes.

807
00:43:12,083 --> 00:43:14,666
But I thought we could be twins.

808
00:43:14,750 --> 00:43:18,583
Eh, eh? See? Twins.

809
00:43:19,416 --> 00:43:21,000
Great. Now I gotta change.

810
00:43:23,250 --> 00:43:25,833
What did you do your
Life Sciences project on?

811
00:43:26,708 --> 00:43:29,750
- My what?
- Your Life Sciences project.

812
00:43:29,833 --> 00:43:31,000
It's due today.

813
00:43:31,083 --> 00:43:32,458
That's due today?

814
00:43:32,541 --> 00:43:35,791
Yeah. And it's, like,
25% of our grade.

815
00:43:35,875 --> 00:43:39,000
Oh, man! I forgot all
about that project.

816
00:43:39,083 --> 00:43:43,625
What are you gonna do? 'Cause
this project is 25% of our grade.

817
00:43:43,708 --> 00:43:45,583
I know, Rowley! Let me think.

818
00:43:52,166 --> 00:43:53,166
Rodrick.

819
00:43:54,291 --> 00:43:55,375
Rodrick?

820
00:43:59,166 --> 00:44:00,875
Rodrick! I need your help!

821
00:44:00,958 --> 00:44:04,000
Calm down, Gregory. What's
got your underwear in a bunch?

822
00:44:04,083 --> 00:44:06,166
I've got a Life Science
project due today!

823
00:44:06,750 --> 00:44:08,958
Yeah? And what's that
got to do with me?

824
00:44:09,041 --> 00:44:12,166
Well, I figured you might know
some trick. Some way out of this.

825
00:44:13,291 --> 00:44:16,333
Well, you could pretend
you're sick. Skip school.

826
00:44:16,416 --> 00:44:19,375
Mom would know I'm
faking. She always knows.

827
00:44:19,458 --> 00:44:21,291
You could tell your
teacher Manny ate it.

828
00:44:21,375 --> 00:44:23,625
Really, Rodrick? That's the
best you can come up with?

829
00:44:29,208 --> 00:44:32,958
You know I still have dirt on you,
right? I can come clean to Mom right now.

830
00:44:34,833 --> 00:44:39,291
Hmm. Did you say Life Sciences?
That does ring a bell.

831
00:44:40,750 --> 00:44:42,166
Let's see.

832
00:44:42,750 --> 00:44:43,875
No. No.

833
00:44:43,958 --> 00:44:46,750
- [grunts] Ah!
- What are you doing?

834
00:44:47,375 --> 00:44:52,041
My life Sciences project.
And in mint condition too.

835
00:44:52,750 --> 00:44:53,750
Let me see that.

836
00:44:53,833 --> 00:44:55,208
Uh-uh-uh-uh!

837
00:44:55,291 --> 00:44:58,125
This is some of my best
work. It's why I saved it.

838
00:44:58,208 --> 00:44:59,541
Awesome. Here, give it.

839
00:44:59,625 --> 00:45:03,166
No, sir. This is gonna cost you.

840
00:45:03,250 --> 00:45:06,875
Come on, Rodrick. Me and you
have a partnership. A deal.

841
00:45:06,958 --> 00:45:11,375
Yeah. Well, our deal doesn't cover
this kind of thing. This is extra.

842
00:45:11,458 --> 00:45:13,083
Okay, what do you want for it?

843
00:45:13,166 --> 00:45:14,666
I want cash.

844
00:45:14,750 --> 00:45:17,000
[groans] I don't have any cash.

845
00:45:17,083 --> 00:45:19,791
I'm talking Mom Bucks.
Large bills only.

846
00:45:19,875 --> 00:45:21,791
Come on, Rodrick.
Don't you have enough?

847
00:45:21,875 --> 00:45:25,625
No, you can never have enough Mom
Bucks. That's Rodrick Rule number five.

848
00:45:25,708 --> 00:45:27,833
Fine. I'll give you
20. That's fair.

849
00:45:28,833 --> 00:45:33,666
Mmm, actually, you seem
a little too eager.

850
00:45:33,750 --> 00:45:34,958
Make it a hundred.

851
00:45:35,041 --> 00:45:36,041
[groans]

852
00:45:37,333 --> 00:45:39,833
Fine. But you can't
tell anyone about this.

853
00:45:40,583 --> 00:45:44,583
I may be a lot of things, but
one thing I am not is a snitch.

854
00:45:48,500 --> 00:45:50,750
Great doing business
with you, brother.

855
00:45:52,750 --> 00:45:55,583
[bell rings]

856
00:45:56,208 --> 00:46:02,125
You got one of Rodrick's old
projects? But isn't that cheating?

857
00:46:02,208 --> 00:46:05,208
It's not cheating.
It's gaming the system.

858
00:46:07,375 --> 00:46:09,375
I told you not to
look at me like that.

859
00:46:09,458 --> 00:46:11,041
But what if he got a bad grade?

860
00:46:11,125 --> 00:46:14,666
My parents always help Rodrick

00:55:51,666 --> 00:55:55,541
<i>because by the time I got to school,
the story was totally scrambled.</i>

1031
00:55:58,250 --> 00:55:59,500
<i>Somehow the story went</i>

1032
00:55:59,583 --> 00:56:02,791
<i>from me being caught in the
ladies' room at Leisure Towers,</i>

1033
00:56:02,875 --> 00:56:07,166
<i>to me sneaking into a bingo game and
walking off with the grand prize.</i>

1034
00:56:07,250 --> 00:56:09,750
Bingo! [chuckles]

1036
00:56:10,916 --> 00:56:14,458

me getting chased by the security guards.</i>

1037
00:56:14,541 --> 00:56:16,916
<i>But even that stuff
got exaggerated.</i>

<i>made it into the story,</i>

1043
00:56:30,625 --> 00:56:32,291
<i>but the facts got
mixed up there too.</i>

1044
00:56:33,833 --> 00:56:36,833
<i>I wasn't exactly in a hurry to
set the record straight, though.</i>

1045
00:56:36,916 --> 00:56:40,250

story made me look pretty sick.</i>

like to be popular for once.</i>

I got his autograph!

knew it wouldn't last.</i>

Rowley's assistant at the talent show,</i>

gonna take a nosedive.</i>

have to go to this thing.

[Frank] Okay. Everyone, hop
out. I'll go look for a spot.

1060
00:57:40,166 --> 00:57:42,500
Yo! What's shaking, little man?

1061
00:57:42,583 --> 00:57:43,791
Uh, nothing much.

1062
00:57:43,875 --> 00:57:47,541
So, we heard about your little
dustup over at Leisure Towers.

1063
00:57:47,625 --> 00:57:48,625
The what?

1064
00:57:49,250 --> 00:57:50,375
Oh, yeah. That.

1065
00:57:50,458 --> 00:57:53,041
Dude, you're a legend!

1066
00:57:53,125 --> 00:57:55,500
An absolute lege, dude!

1067
00:57:55,583 --> 00:57:56,875
Yeah, I guess.

1068
00:57:56,958 --> 00:57:58,625
So, we were thinking,

1069
00:57:59,333 --> 00:58:03,666
if we join forces tonight,
we could win this thing.

1070
00:58:03,750 --> 00:58:05,458
Huh? I-I don't get it.

1071
00:58:05,541 --> 00:58:08,750
You've got the middle school vote.
And we've got the high school vote.

1072
00:58:08,833 --> 00:58:11,208
And I've got the Mom
vote. Not to brag.

1073
00:58:11,291 --> 00:58:13,125
What do you mean "join forces"?

1074
00:58:13,208 --> 00:58:18,250
How'd you like to be
Löded Diper's new drummer?

1075
00:58:18,791 --> 00:58:20,833
What? I don't know
how to play the drums.

1076
00:58:20,916 --> 00:58:22,875
We know your brother's
been teaching you.

1077
00:58:22,958 --> 00:58:26,583
Time for the student
to become the master.

1078
00:58:26,666 --> 00:58:31,291
Sorry, guys. I'm in my friend's
magic act. I can't get out of it.

1079
00:58:31,375 --> 00:58:37,708
That's where Larry comes in. We'll
do a clean swap. You for him.

00:58:37,791 --> 00:58:39,791
Magic is my real passion.

Ta-da!

1082
00:58:42,166 --> 00:58:46,166
I just can't do that to
Rodrick. He's my brother.

1083
00:58:47,250 --> 00:58:48,833
Why don't you just
think it over?

1084
00:58:49,750 --> 00:58:52,416
Maybe this is your
turn to shine, my dude.

1085
00:59:04,083 --> 00:59:05,541
I'll think about it.

1086
00:59:06,041 --> 00:59:08,750
That's all we're
asking, little man.

back at me for the diary thing.

all right, like, in the long run?

What? What do you mean?

Well, Dad and his brothers don't even
see each other on holidays anymore.

1156

Is that gonna happen to us?

1157

other on the holidays. We're family.

that you're both grounded?

Yeah, I know.

1189

Rodrick isn't supposed
to be up there.

to extend your punishment.
