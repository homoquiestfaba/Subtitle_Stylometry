1
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:31,595
Christian, how are you, son?

2
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:34,434
Good. You missed mass, Papa.

3
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:37,076
I don't go for that religious stuff.

4
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:38,878
Don't you believe in God?

5
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:43,353
You don't have to go to church
to believe in God.

6
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:47,991
God is everywhere. He's inside you.
He's in me. He's in Mommy.

7
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:49,753
Even in bad people?

8
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:53,470
Yeah, even in bad people.

9
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:56,875
So what's with you?

10
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:58,429
Nothing.

11
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:00,959
Why were you so late?

12
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:03,949
Ambassador called.
I'm sorry. We can still go.

13
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:05,958
-Where we going?
-The movies.

14
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:07,428
The movies?

15
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:11,238
Which one, huh?

16
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:15,719
Go get us a paper, and while you're
at it, get yourself a woman.

17
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:20,871
We'll make it, just like I promised.

18
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:24,159
You promise him a lot of things.

19
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:25,475
I have to work.

20
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:29,912
Let's just have fun, huh?

21
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,518
Here's your newspaper, Papa.

22
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,309
And the woman said
she needed more money.

23
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:45,193
Hey, Chris!

24
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:46,755
Peter!

25
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:48,595
-How are you?
-Good.

26
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:50,034
Good to see you.

27
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:52,554
Maria.

28
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:55,358
So what are you guys up to?

29
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:57,073
Going to the movies.

30
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:02,948
Don't get mad now, but I gotta borrow
your father for a couple of hours.

31
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:06,789
-What?
-We gotta get back. We got an alert.

32
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:14,391
It's a bomb threat.
Some Muslim fundamentalist group.

33
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:15,755
Again?

34
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:20,719
Shit.

35
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:23,152
Well, colonel's orders.

36
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:26,350
Behave.

37
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:27,749
All right.

38
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:39,397
I'm really sorry I can't take you
to the movies. We'll go tomorrow.

39
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:42,108
No, you can't do that.
You promised him.

40
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:44,595
It's an emergency. I have to go.

41
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:47,756
Why?

42
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:49,075
I have to.

43
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:59,154
I'm really sorry.

44
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:01,678
Take care.
See you later.

45
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:17,629
Come here.

46
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,596
Maybe you should take a week off.

47
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:31,949
I could use it.

48
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:33,593
I know she could use it.

49
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:52,154
Call for ambulances!

50
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:53,515
Yes, sir!

51
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:58,349
Maria!

52
00:04:58,560 --> 00:04:59,675
Maria!

53
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:11,599
Oh, God! God! God!

54
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:13,993
Somebody! Help!

55
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:15,589
Christian!

56
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:19,392
Help! Somebody! Help!

57
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:20,516
God!

58
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:36,149
All right, Josh.

59
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:38,956
The plane's ready
for transport to Dover.

60
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:40,070
May we?

61
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:47,758
We'll get them, Josh.

62
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,639
We'll track them down.

63
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,756
"Track them down"? Bullshit.

64
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:55,794
Just walk down the street
to the nearest mosque.

65
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:58,960
Look, Josh. I know this
is a bad time for you.

66
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:01,198
Let us investigate.

67
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:04,557
We'll find these people.
They'll be brought to justice.

68
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:08,758
I'll meet you at the airport.

69
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:12,919
Carry on, sergeant.

70
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:25,196
Where you going?

71
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:26,395
For a walk.

72
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:22,393
Gentlemen, you lost
your name, your passports...

73
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:27,634
...your bank accounts,
your right to get married.

74
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,956
But we will give you new name...

75
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:33,797
...date of birth
and a second chance.

76
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:37,153
Above all...

77
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:38,395
...a family.

78
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:41,235
Don't forget, gentlemen.

79
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,115
A family!

80
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:46,156
But if any of you doesn't function...

81
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:49,352
...the whole family does not function.

82
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:52,593
We fight for no country...

83
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:53,995
...no flag...

84
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:56,438
...or political boss.

85
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,672
We fight for honour...

86
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:02,391
...our fellow soldiers.

87
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:07,038
We never leave our dead
or wounded behind.

88
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:10,436
We...

89
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:13,758
...respect our enemy.

90
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:19,034
We fight...

91
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:21,917
...anywhere in the world.

92
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:25,878
We have no home.

93
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:30,872
The Foreign Legion
is our home, gentlemen!

94
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:03,111
Watch it. They look real dangerous.

95
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:04,994
Scary.

96
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:09,992
What a fucking job.

97
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:12,751
I'm glad we're not re-enlisting.

98
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:15,599
Six years in the Legion.
That's enough.

99
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:17,434
But what we gonna do?

100
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,433
I mean...

101
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:23,550
...I'd like to find a war where
I fight for something I believe in.

102
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:28,951
You wanna hate the guys you pop?

103
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:31,196
Yeah, it'd be nice for a change.

104
00:11:58,040 --> 00:11:59,632
Look what I found, man.

105
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:01,313
Good grass.

106
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:05,477
Let's roll a huge bomber.

107
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:08,154
Not for me.

108
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:10,393
Well, I need one.

109
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:14,198
This war sucks, man.

110
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:17,998
Stop thinking about it.

111
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,672
I'm getting out of here.

112
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:35,671
What are you gonna do?
Sell used fucking cars...

113
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:39,160
...until somebody finds out
who you are?

114
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:45,958
Open a butcher shop.

115
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:50,874
Don't do it.

116
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:52,839
Just don't do it.

117
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:57,552
Hey, you've done nothing wrong here.

118
00:12:57,800 --> 00:12:59,597
Well, it feels like I did.

119
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:01,159
I'm getting out.

120
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:12,558
I'll miss you, man.

121
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:57,276
Hey, hey, hey, can you hear me?
Can you hear me?

122
00:13:57,640 --> 00:14:00,154
Don't you ever get bored up there?

123
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:05,599
What do you want?

124
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:08,308
Haven't you heard, man?
They called a truce.

125
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:11,956
We have to go back to my village
to pick up prisoners for exchange.

126
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:14,629
Exchange?

127
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:16,758
Yeah, man, exchange with Muslims.

128
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,436
They captured some of ours a year ago.
Now they wanna get rid of them.

129
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:23,994
Give me a minute.

130
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:26,550
Hurry up, man. Hurry up.

131
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:31,153
I wanna take a look around here
for rats before we go to exchange.

132
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:35,359
-I thought there was a truce.
-Don't be so naive, man.

133
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:40,355
Truce is the best time to chase rats.
Just give me a hand. All right?

134
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:44,995
Hey, Keith!

135
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,831
Keith, everything okay?

136
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:50,755
It's me, man. I'm coming.
Don't shoot!

137
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:57,593
Anything for you?

138
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:07,553
What's the matter with you?
You became emotional?

139
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:08,988
Don't like the mess?

140
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:11,479
Nice legs.

141
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:14,310
Someone did our job already.

142
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:31,638
You know what she said?
She said she likes you. You know?

143
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:35,072
She said she needs a man like you
to make her feel young again.

144
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:36,833
Let's go, Goran.

145
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:42,319
Didn't she?

146
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:44,750
I saw you looking at her, you know.

147
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:46,669
I saw you.

148
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:49,550
But I like the younger one.

149
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:51,432
Like this one.

150
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:54,351
It's a shame she's dead.

151
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:32,751
Why did you do that?

152
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:38,749
She's just an old Muslim bitch.

153
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:42,793
Let her bleed to death.

154
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:22,914
Nice and quiet.

155
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:27,192
A perfect week.

156
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:33,155
You're French?

157
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:37,118
American. I lived in France.

158
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:39,873
You ever see...

159
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:43,274
...9-0-2-1-0?

160
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:45,550
What?

161
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:47,597
Beverly Hills 9-0-2-1-0.

162
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:49,388
Wacky show.

163
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:51,275
Take a look.

164
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:55,479
See this? It's Luke Perry.
You know the guy?

165
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:00,912
I should, like, grow these....
How do you call these...?

166
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:02,395
Sideburns?

167
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:04,153
Yeah, sideburns.

168
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:06,152
Can you imagine me?

169
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:09,278
Brand-new partner
with brand-new sideburns.

170
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:12,756
You ought to go to Hollywood.

171
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:17,954
I don't think they'd like a Serb
student in Beverly Hills High School.

172
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:22,268
So lived in France?

173
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:27,158
Why did you come over here?

174
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:34,959
Not many Western men here for Serbs,
you know.

175
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:38,149
Most of them think we are
the bad guys.

176
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:43,156
It's good to have someone like you
to see what's going on here.

177
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:48,670
We just fight for our land.
That's all.

178
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:22,952
What the fuck do you think
you're doing?!

179
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:29,149
Hold your fire.
We got a kid on the bridge.

180
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:32,393
Fuck the captain's orders.
We're not gonna shoot kids.

181
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:35,399
We're not turning into
baby-killers, are we?

182
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,718
What a fucking crazy kid.

183
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:43,398
It's a girl, man.

184
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:47,951
She's sure got balls.

185
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:57,396
Chewing gum?

186
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:02,239
Don't be afraid.

187
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:17,832
What the fuck do you think
you're doing? What the fuck?

188
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:22,390
Is that what you call a truce?
Is that what you call a truce?

189
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:23,959
Motherfuckers!

190
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:26,318
They betrayed us!

191
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:39,352
Where are you going?

192
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:11,796
See her?

193
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:16,150
She's the daughter of a
Muslim bastard my father worked for.

194
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:19,438
Many years worked hard,
but never was paid good.

195
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:22,957
Then I saw her in prison camp
and I fucked her many times.

196
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:25,039
You know what she said?

197
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:29,119
She said I was the best she ever had.
And everybody had her.

198
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:32,716
-They fuck your women too, you know.
-That's shit!

199
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:35,198
Our women are stronger.

200
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,913
Most would rather kill themselves
than be fucked by Turk or Croat.

201
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:43,395
Many good priests,
and we got this one.

202
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:49,870
Shit.

203
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:52,873
He preaches, and Goran
does the dirty work.

204
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:09,636
Check the houses up the hill.
They're sneaky bastards.

205
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:51,351
Hello, my Serbian brothers!

206
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:54,116
I got a little present for you!

207
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:26,755
What the fuck is she doing in the car?

208
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,558
We're gonna take her home.

209
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:31,636
She tell you where she lives?

210
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:34,759
I know where she lives.

211
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:44,232
Did you see the green scarves?
At exchange?

212
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:47,872
Those are mujahideens,
holy Allah warriors.

213
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:50,918
We all gonna send them
to their fucking God!

214
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:54,036
She's been fucking all of them.

215
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:55,878
-She was raped.
-Raped?

216
00:26:56,720 --> 00:27:00,633
She's a fucking whore with a fucking
Muslim bastard in her belly!

217
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:03,673
Her family, my neighbours,
good Serbs, great warriors....

218
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:05,114
She dishonoured them.

219
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:07,550
Now she wants to get back home.

220
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:22,033
You know what she said?

221
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:25,472
She doesn't have to talk to me.
You don't have to talk to me?

222
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:26,914
Then I'll talk to you!

223
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:31,068
What are you doing?

224
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:32,639
I'm talking, okay?

225
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:35,832
I'm having conversation here.
That okay for you?

226
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:07,118
Now she wants to talk to me!

227
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:12,835
What's that?

228
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:15,156
The little Muslim bastard
is coming out.

229
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:18,278
Well, I'm not sure about that.
I'm not sure about that!

230
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:19,990
Goran.

231
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:26,114
-Enough!
-Shut up! It's not your business!

232
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:28,157
Come on! I'm waiting!
Come on, baby!

233
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:29,435
That's enough!

234
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:32,438
Push the fucking baby!
Come on!

235
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:11,993
I'm gonna help you.

236
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:26,870
All right.

237
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:28,839
I can see the head.

238
00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:30,035
You push.

239
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:31,759
Just push.

240
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:33,756
That's it.

241
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:35,355
Push.

242
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:42,628
It's almost there.

243
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:43,909
Push.

244
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:50,230
Push. Push. It's coming.

245
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:51,436
Almost.

246
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:55,913
Keep pushing. Almost.

247
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:01,195
One more time.

248
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:18,596
It's a girl.

249
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:36,356
Breathe.

250
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,194
Don't do that.

251
00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:06,798
You don't want to do that.

252
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:23,836
I need you to hold this baby.

253
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:27,953
Can you hold the baby?

254
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:34,513
You speak English?

255
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:46,314
Here. You need to hold the baby.

256
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:50,719
You need to feed it.

257
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:53,870
You understand? You need to feed it.

258
00:32:58,680 --> 00:33:00,830
I'm just gonna help you, all right?

259
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:03,678
Just giving you help.

260
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:10,997
Put it up to your breast.

261
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:23,436
What's the matter? Are you dry?

262
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:25,354
You have no milk?

263
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:29,429
That's all right.
Feed it when you get home.

264
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:34,831
Can't you at least hold the thing?

265
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:08,039
Speak English.

266
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:13,510
Was she a part
of prisoner exchange today?

267
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:16,437
Yeah. I brought her here.

268
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:19,555
Where is Goran? I saw his car.

269
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:21,594
He couldn't come.

270
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:12,230
You must go.

271
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:14,518
And take them with you.

272
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:18,276
I can't take them with me.

273
00:38:18,520 --> 00:38:19,999
They can't stay here.

274
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:22,597
You have any cousins?

275
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,513
Do you know anybody?

276
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:33,591
All right, here's what's gonna happen.

277
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:37,392
I'm gonna take you to
the refugee camp in Bileca.

278
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:38,715
Bileca?

279
00:39:40,680 --> 00:39:42,591
Somebody there'll take you in.

280
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:45,035
Somebody will take the kid too.

281
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:47,396
I'll be done with this bullshit.

282
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:54,358
I tried to help you, but fuck it.
You know?

283
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:56,553
Fuck it. I'm done.

284
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:06,510
Jesus Christ, that's driving me nuts.

285
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:08,990
Does it make you feel anything?

286
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:13,239
Think you could stick
a bottle in that kid's mouth...

287
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:15,789
...so I could get you
where you need to go?

288
00:40:25,560 --> 00:40:26,993
Son of a bitch!

289
00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:29,356
I'll feed the little bitch myself!

290
00:40:35,080 --> 00:40:36,274
I'm coming.

291
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:46,238
Just quiet down.
Calm down. I'll be right there.

292
00:40:56,280 --> 00:40:57,599
Where's the nipple?

293
00:40:59,640 --> 00:41:00,993
Oh, fuck.

294
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:15,394
Where's the motherfucking nipple?

295
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:41,679
You got a better idea?

296
00:41:56,080 --> 00:41:58,992
Be the best use ever
for one of these, though.

297
00:42:04,680 --> 00:42:06,511
We got a surprise for you.

298
00:42:09,840 --> 00:42:10,875
All right.

299
00:42:11,640 --> 00:42:14,757
I'd take it if I were you.
It's all there is.

300
00:42:16,360 --> 00:42:17,270
Come on.

301
00:42:36,360 --> 00:42:38,999
You'd just as soon
see this kid dead, huh?

302
00:42:39,480 --> 00:42:41,277
Can't do it yourself?

303
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:45,998
Don't worry about it.
You're better off for it.

304
00:42:51,080 --> 00:42:53,196
It's easy to kill somebody.

305
00:42:54,440 --> 00:42:56,795
You just pull the trigger
and it's done.

306
00:42:59,160 --> 00:43:00,673
Living with it.

307
00:43:02,760 --> 00:43:04,557
You gotta harden up for that.

308
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:50,108
Give me the bottle.

309
00:44:55,080 --> 00:44:56,069
Your mother's a bitch.

310
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:10,595
But you'll be lucky if you turn out
to be as pretty as she is.

311
00:46:44,040 --> 00:46:45,234
It's blues.

312
00:46:46,200 --> 00:46:47,679
It gets me going.

313
00:46:51,040 --> 00:46:54,510
Low down and dirty
Pay his dues

314
00:46:56,040 --> 00:46:58,110
What's the matter?
Don't like the blues?

315
00:47:02,120 --> 00:47:05,715
Come on, kid.
Can't even the blues shut you up?

316
00:47:28,480 --> 00:47:30,550
I don't suppose you'd change this kid?

317
00:47:32,040 --> 00:47:33,234
Guess not.

318
00:47:53,560 --> 00:47:54,595
Man, you stink.

319
00:47:56,240 --> 00:47:58,800
That's a lot of shit for a little kid.

320
00:48:12,680 --> 00:48:13,669
Fuck it.

321
00:48:33,080 --> 00:48:34,229
It's not very ladylike.

322
00:49:19,280 --> 00:49:21,510
I hope you appreciate this.

323
00:49:44,680 --> 00:49:46,989
What do you think of this new style?

324
00:49:47,440 --> 00:49:49,271
Think they'll like that in Milan?
