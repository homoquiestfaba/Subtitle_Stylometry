No. Nope. Nope.

345
00:15:44,166 --> 00:15:45,500
Oh. [chuckles]

346
00:15:45,583 --> 00:15:46,583
Thank God.

347
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,583
Good, 'cause you just look sick.

348
00:15:49,666 --> 00:15:52,458
But we work from home when we're sick.

349
00:15:52,541 --> 00:15:54,833
- Okay?
- Yes. Yes. I feel great.

350
00:15:54,916 --> 00:15:56,208
Okay. Um...

351
00:15:56,750 --> 00:15:59,458
[speaking Spanish]

352
00:15:59,541 --> 00:16:00,375
Right.

353
00:16:00,458 --> 00:16:01,791
[Darcy] There you are!

354
00:16:02,666 --> 00:16:05,250
- [laughing]
- [Darcy speaking Spanish]

355
00:16:05,333 --> 00:16:06,333
Come.

356
00:16:06,833 --> 00:16:10,958
Hey, um, Jenna, I'd like to introduce you
to our new videographer.

357
00:16:11,041 --> 00:16:14,208
Although, he prefers to refer to it
as filmmaking.

358
00:16:14,291 --> 00:16:15,750
[chuckles]

359
00:16:15,833 --> 00:16:17,041
It's my son.

360
00:16:18,541 --> 00:16:20,625
- Eric.
- Your what?

361
00:16:21,541 --> 00:16:25,125
Yeah. Look, I don't want you to think
there's some company nepotism going on.

362
00:16:25,208 --> 00:16:29,041
He graduated
with his master's degree from USC.

363
00:16:29,125 --> 00:16:32,125
Who has a master's? Who?
Who has master's? Is it you?

364
00:16:32,208 --> 00:16:34,625
- It's me, yeah. Yeah.
- [indistinct baby talk]

365
00:16:34,708 --> 00:16:38,375
- So nice.
- And a very vigorous vetting process.

366
00:16:38,458 --> 00:16:40,958
I'm also exceptionally talented, so...
[chuckles]

367
00:16:41,041 --> 00:16:42,583
I'm sure you are.

368
00:16:42,666 --> 00:16:44,958
Yeah, there's nothing wrong
with Black nepotism, so...

369
00:16:45,041 --> 00:16:48,208
Right? Right? That's what I'm saying.

370
00:16:49,375 --> 00:16:53,291
Well, Eric is going to help you create
content for our subscriptions relaunch.

371
00:16:53,375 --> 00:16:54,708
So I want you to think original.

372
00:16:54,791 --> 00:16:59,708
I want you to think fresh,
sassy, exclusive, all right?

373
00:16:59,791 --> 00:17:03,125
Content is king, and as you like to say,

374
00:17:03,208 --> 00:17:05,166
"Community is queen."

375
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:06,416
Hmm.

376
00:17:06,916 --> 00:17:08,750
- We got it, Mom.
- [mumbles]

377
00:17:08,833 --> 00:17:10,083
No "Mom."

378
00:17:10,166 --> 00:17:13,416
<i>Nada de</i> "Mom." <i>Aquí,</i> Darcy. Okay?

379
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:15,500
Darcy, at work.

380
00:17:15,583 --> 00:17:16,791
We got it, Darcy.

381
00:17:16,875 --> 00:17:18,250
All right. Well, you two got it.

382
00:17:18,333 --> 00:17:21,000
I'll welcome him. Take good care of him.
[chuckles]

383
00:17:21,083 --> 00:17:23,708
I love you so much.
You're such a good boy.

384
00:17:23,791 --> 00:17:26,000
- Thank you.
- Okay, go on. Don't fuck this up.

385
00:17:26,083 --> 00:17:27,083
[chuckles]

386
00:17:27,166 --> 00:17:28,541
[Darcy] All right, <i>vámonos.</i>

387
00:17:29,083 --> 00:17:30,708
[Darcy speaking Spanish]

388
00:17:32,791 --> 00:17:33,833
[sighs]

389
00:17:34,458 --> 00:17:35,458
Hmm.

390
00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:38,750
You gotta admit.
You gotta admit it's funny.

391
00:17:38,833 --> 00:17:41,833
- This isn't funny!
- [laughs] I mean, it's kind of hilarious.

392
00:17:41,916 --> 00:17:44,166
- Mm-mm.
- I mean, it is funny, right?

393
00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:46,333
- No. No, it's not.
- You still love me?

394
00:17:48,375 --> 00:17:50,541
I'll have you know
that I barely remember anything

395
00:17:50,625 --> 00:17:52,083
that happened between us last night.

396
00:17:52,166 --> 00:17:54,333
Hmm. Cool, so why you trippin'?

397
00:17:54,958 --> 00:17:59,083
Because your mom,
your mommy, she's my boss.

398
00:17:59,166 --> 00:18:00,326
You think I'm gonna tell her?

399
00:18:00,375 --> 00:18:02,791
I don't know what the fuck
you're gonna do! I don't know you!

400
00:18:02,875 --> 00:18:06,958
Okay, yo, take a breath, all right?
We were drunk. We made out at a party.

401
00:18:07,041 --> 00:18:10,458
The world will continue to turn.
Everything's good. It's cool.

402
00:18:10,541 --> 00:18:12,250
You're enjoying this, aren't you?

403
00:18:12,333 --> 00:18:15,500
Mm. I can't lie.
I'm happy to see you again.

404
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:17,750
No. No, no.

405
00:18:17,833 --> 00:18:20,416
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

406
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:23,000
That... That... That thing you're doing,

407
00:18:23,083 --> 00:18:25,875
don't do that.
This is my career! You have to stop!

408
00:18:25,958 --> 00:18:29,041
I'm just here to keep my head down
so I can get the hell out of here.

409
00:18:29,125 --> 00:18:31,000
So you ain't gotta worry about me, okay?

410
00:18:31,916 --> 00:18:34,166
I read about this, about your generation.

411
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:37,833
You guys are spoiled
and ungrateful and entitled.

412
00:18:37,916 --> 00:18:39,291
Yeah, okay, I know what this is.

413
00:18:39,375 --> 00:18:42,375
And I read about 40-plus-year-old
professional, single, Black women

414
00:18:42,458 --> 00:18:45,541
being bitter and mean,
but I always thought it was a stereotype.

415
00:18:45,625 --> 00:18:48,166
- No, those are Tyler Perry movies.
- You'd fit in perfectly.

416
00:18:49,875 --> 00:18:51,833
Have a good one, ma'am. [laughs]

417
00:18:55,125 --> 00:18:57,458
Eric got him some vintage pussy.

418
00:18:57,541 --> 00:18:58,875
- Some throwback!
- [both laugh]

419
00:18:58,958 --> 00:19:00,583
Some AARP pussy. Yeah.

420
00:19:00,666 --> 00:19:02,458
You know she got some skills.

421
00:19:02,541 --> 00:19:05,750
She probably got all kinds of new tricks.
She 'bout to school you, boy!

422
00:19:05,833 --> 00:19:09,833
Nah, I don't care though. She fine.
That's all I gotta say. She is fine.

423
00:19:09,916 --> 00:19:12,500
- Yo, don't shit where you eat.
- Uh-huh.

424
00:19:12,583 --> 00:19:16,166
Like me? I don't fuck niggas at the club.
You see me fucking niggas at the club?

425
00:19:16,250 --> 00:19:17,916
What? You met Tim at the club.

426
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,375
- But we ain't fucked till we got home.
- Exactly.

427
00:19:20,458 --> 00:19:23,208
That's why I love you so much.
Come here. Classy.

428
00:19:23,291 --> 00:19:25,041
- [laughing]
- Yeah, all right.

429
00:19:26,166 --> 00:19:28,166
[horns honking]

430
00:19:32,291 --> 00:19:33,291
Yo, yo!

431
00:19:35,333 --> 00:19:36,333
"Yo"?

432
00:19:37,041 --> 00:19:39,083
Is that what passes
for a greeting these days?

433
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:42,583
- Hello. How may I help you?
- Eric, I don't wanna fight with you.

434
00:19:42,666 --> 00:19:44,500
- Okay?
- And I don't wanna fight with you.

435
00:19:44,583 --> 00:19:47,125
Grab your things. We have to be
at Greta Blumen's in 20 minutes,

436
00:19:47,208 --> 00:19:49,000
and it's all the way across town.

437
00:19:56,708 --> 00:20:00,166
So you know Greta Blumen
doesn't have a YouTube, Instagram, nada.

438
00:20:00,250 --> 00:20:03,875
Of course she doesn't.
It's part of the allure. She's private.

439
00:20:05,333 --> 00:20:08,416
Yeah. Well, this is gonna be a wreck.

440
00:20:08,916 --> 00:20:11,583
Says the guy who probably rode
his skateboard to work.

441
00:20:12,666 --> 00:20:15,208
What's the make and model
of the broom you rode in on today?

442
00:20:25,958 --> 00:20:26,791
Okay.

443
00:20:26,875 --> 00:20:28,875
[orchestral music plays]

444
00:20:35,416 --> 00:20:38,958
Hey. Yes, just stand right here.
Let's get a drop before she comes out.

445
00:20:39,041 --> 00:20:40,041
Okay.

446
00:20:40,916 --> 00:20:42,625
- [Eric] All right.
- I look all right?

447
00:20:43,125 --> 00:20:45,125
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, you look good.
- [Jenna] Okay.

448
00:20:45,208 --> 00:20:46,208
Okay.

449
00:20:46,625 --> 00:20:47,958
- [camera beeps]
- And rolling.

450
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:52,583
Hi, I'm Jenna Jones,
the new creative director for Darzine.

451
00:20:52,666 --> 00:20:54,726
- Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Cut. Cut.
- [camera beeps]

452
00:20:54,750 --> 00:20:56,916
- Whose voice is that?
- Mine.

453
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,416
You sound like Candace Owens.

454
00:20:59,333 --> 00:21:01,000
I don't sound like Candace Owens.

455
00:21:02,375 --> 00:21:04,916
Five, four, three, two, one.

456
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:08,416
Yo, yo, yo, what's up?
It's your girl, Jenna Jones, here.

457
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:11,541
<i>Darzine</i> magazine. That's what's up.
What? What?

458
00:21:11,625 --> 00:21:13,083
- What?
- [woman] Jenna!

459
00:21:13,166 --> 00:21:14,041
[Jenna] Hi!

460
00:21:14,125 --> 00:21:16,250
Oh, Jenna, my love.

461
00:21:16,333 --> 00:21:18,916
- Darling.
- What happened?

462
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,041
I was chasing Taraji P. Henson,

463
00:21:21,125 --> 00:21:24,083
and I slipped on my meditation marbles.

464
00:21:24,166 --> 00:21:26,666
Yeah, I'm... I'm sorry.
You were chasing Taraji?

465
00:21:26,750 --> 00:21:29,666
Yes. Taraji P. Henson.

466
00:21:30,333 --> 00:21:31,500
My peacock.

467
00:21:31,583 --> 00:21:33,916
She's one bad bitch,

468
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:38,541
but sadly, she perished in the fall.

469
00:21:39,208 --> 00:21:41,208
- Right.
- Come on. Come. Come. This way.

470
00:21:41,291 --> 00:21:43,458
I have the perfect spot. [groans]

472
00:21:44,791 --> 00:21:45,791
Maybe...

473
00:21:47,083 --> 00:21:49,541
We'll do it here. Right here.

474
00:21:49,625 --> 00:21:54,833
Next to my poor, beautiful baby, Taraji.
[sobs]

475
00:21:54,916 --> 00:21:56,666
Oh, I miss you.

476
00:21:57,833 --> 00:22:00,583
Well, this is it.

477
00:22:01,875 --> 00:22:04,250
Let's... Let's get started, shall we?

478
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,958
Can you tell us a little bit
about your design process?

479
00:22:08,041 --> 00:22:10,333
[sobs]

480
00:22:10,416 --> 00:22:12,125
I miss you.

00:22:12,208 --> 00:22:14,958
I'm so sorry!

482
00:22:17,791 --> 00:22:19,208
Okay, yeah. Um...

483
00:22:20,291 --> 00:22:21,625
Your new collection.

484
00:22:21,708 --> 00:22:25,250
- We'd love to hear about it.
- [sobs]

485
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:30,333
Taraji!

486
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,666
How was I supposed to know
her damn pet peacock died?

487
00:22:36,250 --> 00:22:37,500
I thought it would be epic.

488
00:22:37,583 --> 00:22:40,125
Oh, nah, it was epic. It was an epic fail.

489
00:22:41,666 --> 00:22:43,583
- Why didn't you stop me?
- Are you serious?

490
00:22:43,666 --> 00:22:44,666
Yeah.

491
00:22:45,333 --> 00:22:48,208
As if you consulted me at any point
during this entire process.

492
00:22:48,291 --> 00:22:50,166
This was your struggle idea. Own it.

493
00:22:50,250 --> 00:22:51,541
It's my fault, okay?

494
00:22:51,625 --> 00:22:53,208
It's all my fault.

495
00:22:53,291 --> 00:22:57,041
My whole life is riding on this job,
and I keep fucking it up.

496
00:22:58,416 --> 00:22:59,250
[sighs]

497
00:22:59,333 --> 00:23:03,625
Jenna, believe it or not,
I know what I'm doing, all right?

498
00:23:03,708 --> 00:23:07,708
Why won't you just let me
help you, collaborate? It'd be easier.

499
00:23:10,166 --> 00:23:11,166
Okay.

500
00:23:11,875 --> 00:23:12,875
[phone chimes]

501
00:23:17,875 --> 00:23:19,291
You can answer that.

502
00:23:20,291 --> 00:23:21,291
I'm good.

503
00:23:22,791 --> 00:23:24,000
Is that your girlfriend?

504
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:29,208
Ex-girlfriend. Very recent ex.

505
00:23:29,291 --> 00:23:31,708
No. Oh my God.

506
00:23:31,791 --> 00:23:34,375
Tell me you didn't break up
because of what happened between us.

507
00:23:34,458 --> 00:23:36,833
Oh God, please.
I wouldn't be able to live with myself.

508
00:23:36,916 --> 00:23:41,208
- Oh my God. Are you kidding?
- Yo. Hey, someone let me out this cab.

509
00:23:41,291 --> 00:23:43,541
- What?
- No. I mean, if I caused harm...

510
00:23:43,625 --> 00:23:46,791
Like, I am not that girl.
I'm a girl's girl. Had I known...

511
00:23:46,875 --> 00:23:49,583
Yo, your ego is crazy.

512
00:23:49,666 --> 00:23:52,458
First of all, nothing happened between us.

513
00:23:52,541 --> 00:23:54,625
Well, nah, something happened.

514
00:23:54,708 --> 00:23:58,041
That was, like, level one.
That was mild. Come on, now.

515
00:23:58,125 --> 00:24:00,708
Mild! That was, at least, medium sauce.

516
00:24:00,791 --> 00:24:04,166
Second, she and I were already broken up,
so you're good.

517
00:24:04,250 --> 00:24:06,291
"Girl's girl." Oh my goodness.

518
00:24:08,166 --> 00:24:09,166
Oh.

519
00:24:09,666 --> 00:24:10,666
It's cool.

520
00:24:14,166 --> 00:24:16,375
What's her name?
What does she do? How old is she?

521
00:24:16,458 --> 00:24:17,458
[sighs]

522
00:24:18,208 --> 00:24:20,791
Her name is Madison.
She's a ballerina. She's 22.

523
00:24:20,875 --> 00:24:22,083
Of course she is.

524
00:24:22,750 --> 00:24:26,166
Yo, okay, what's up? What's the deal?
Like, you got a man? What's going on?

525
00:24:26,250 --> 00:24:28,541
I'm in between relationships.

526
00:24:28,625 --> 00:24:30,208
Mainly because men my age

527
00:24:31,375 --> 00:24:32,375
want women Madison's age.

528
00:24:32,458 --> 00:24:33,916
Mm. Mm.

529
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:37,416
I don't know. Maybe they're not interested
in dating women who are complicated.

530
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:39,333
- Oh.
- [Eric] Yeah.

531
00:24:39,416 --> 00:24:40,458
So Madison's simple.

532
00:24:40,541 --> 00:24:41,708
Madison is sweet.

533
00:24:41,791 --> 00:24:46,083
So that's why you broke up.
You got bored of your sweet, simple girl.

534
00:24:46,166 --> 00:24:48,126
- That's not what I said.
- That's what you meant.

535
00:24:48,208 --> 00:24:50,916
You know, this whole bitter
and jaded thing you got going on,

536
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,375
it's a really bad look on you.

537
00:24:52,458 --> 00:24:55,708
It's like some bad energy happening
all right here. Yeah.

538
00:24:55,791 --> 00:24:57,958
Okay, got it. Got it.

539
00:24:59,541 --> 00:25:02,583
- You know, I can't... I can't stand you.
- [chuckles]

540
00:25:02,666 --> 00:25:05,666
- [Jenna] Oh my God!
- Yeah. The feeling is incredibly mutual.

541
00:25:05,750 --> 00:25:08,458
- Oh, you're gonna go?
- Yeah, I'm out.

542
00:25:08,541 --> 00:25:09,791
- Yeah.
- All right.

543
00:25:09,875 --> 00:25:11,875
[horns honking]

544
00:25:17,666 --> 00:25:20,416
[Jenna] <i>There's something about that guy.
He drives me crazy.</i>

545
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:23,041
And he just knows how to irk me.

546
00:25:23,125 --> 00:25:25,958
Well, he's Darcy Hale's son.
He's probably half demon.

547
00:25:26,041 --> 00:25:29,958
I can't even... I can't even trip off at him
because I don't feel like myself now.

548
00:25:30,041 --> 00:25:31,916
I don't... I don't feel like I have it.

549
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
I feel rusty. I'm struggling.

550
00:25:34,083 --> 00:25:37,041
I've researched
and pitched out this whole concept.

551
00:25:37,625 --> 00:25:41,083
And now I'm like, "Can I even deliver?"
I don't feel like I can.

552
00:25:41,166 --> 00:25:43,291
Of course you can.

553
00:25:44,083 --> 00:25:48,291
Everybody has imposter syndrome,
but you just gotta dig deep.

554
00:25:48,375 --> 00:25:50,500
Find what excites you, Jenna.
You got this.

555
00:25:50,583 --> 00:25:53,458
- Problem is he excites me.
- There's that.

556
00:25:53,541 --> 00:25:56,125
- That's the problem.
- You gotta find what else excites ya.

557
00:25:56,208 --> 00:25:58,750
- Yeah, what else?
- Excites you more.

558
00:25:58,833 --> 00:26:00,833
["Apache Dance" plays]

559
00:26:19,708 --> 00:26:21,583
Hi. Is it really you?

560
00:26:21,666 --> 00:26:22,958
Oh my God.

561
00:26:23,458 --> 00:26:25,291
Your pieces are stunning.

562
00:26:25,375 --> 00:26:27,455
Thank you so much.
This is one of my favorite pieces.

563
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:29,791
- Superb work.
- [woman] Thank you.

564
00:26:29,875 --> 00:26:31,791
- What... What's your name?
- Becca Jay.

565
00:26:31,875 --> 00:26:32,708
Becca Jay.

566
00:26:32,791 --> 00:26:36,000
Here's my card.
I'm here every week, so come see me.

567
00:26:36,083 --> 00:26:37,416
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

568
00:26:40,958 --> 00:26:42,598
- Oh, what you got there?
- Find anything?

569
00:26:42,666 --> 00:26:43,666
- Right?
- That's cute.

570
00:26:43,750 --> 00:26:45,250
- That looks good.
- Super cute.

571
00:26:45,333 --> 00:26:46,166
I love that.

572
00:26:46,250 --> 00:26:48,000
That'd be nice for date night.

573
00:26:48,083 --> 00:26:50,708
Well, I'd have to get a date
for date night. That part.

574
00:26:50,791 --> 00:26:53,208
Well, I may have a guy
that I wanna introduce you to.

575
00:26:53,291 --> 00:26:54,291
- No!
- What guy?

576
00:26:54,375 --> 00:26:55,250
Jenna!

577
00:26:55,333 --> 00:26:57,333
- Don't say no so fast.
- Hello?

578
00:26:57,416 --> 00:27:00,458
This guy is solid.
He... He owns the wine shop.

579
00:27:00,541 --> 00:27:03,125
Bubbles and Brew? He's 50 years old.

580
00:27:03,208 --> 00:27:05,750
- He can spell. He can write.
- He can spell!

581
00:27:05,833 --> 00:27:07,625
- He can spell.
- Okay.

582
00:27:07,708 --> 00:27:10,333
- Might be a eater of pussies.
- That's all you had to say.

583
00:27:10,416 --> 00:27:11,666
- Okay, sold.
- [woman] Sold.

584
00:27:11,750 --> 00:27:16,125
And I can't be turning down dates,
not when they doing all that.

585
00:27:16,208 --> 00:27:17,791
- There you go.
- Yeah.

586
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:23,041
Jenna, this came for you.

587
00:27:23,125 --> 00:27:25,000
Oh. Thank you, guys.

588
00:27:25,083 --> 00:27:26,291
[both] You're welcome.

589
00:27:33,791 --> 00:27:36,500
"I hear a welcome back is in order.
Would love to catch up."

590
00:27:36,583 --> 00:27:38,333
"Until then, coffee on me."

591
00:27:38,875 --> 00:27:41,125
Brian. Asshole.

592
00:27:44,458 --> 00:27:45,583
Wanna talk about it?

593
00:27:45,666 --> 00:27:48,625
Absolutely not,
but I did wanna speak with you.

594
00:27:48,708 --> 00:27:49,708
About?

595
00:27:51,041 --> 00:27:55,458
Yeah, I want to apologize
for upsetting you last Friday.

596
00:27:55,541 --> 00:27:56,875
I'm not upset.

597
00:27:56,958 --> 00:27:58,791
- You were upset.
- Nah, I'm good.

598
00:27:58,875 --> 00:28:01,916
I just think maybe we shouldn't
talk about our personal lives at work.

599
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,416
Agreed.

600
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:06,291
Uh, and I would appreciate it

601
00:28:06,375 --> 00:28:11,291
if you would stop making references
to me... being old and bitter.

602
00:28:11,958 --> 00:28:13,041
Nah. Nah, I hear you.

603
00:28:13,125 --> 00:28:16,958
Um, I mean, you kind of started it with
the whole being spoiled, being a brat,

604
00:28:17,041 --> 00:28:19,500
talking 'bout my generation,
that whole spiel.

605
00:28:19,583 --> 00:28:22,500
It's kind of corny, but...
Yeah, yep. No, I hear you.

606
00:28:23,208 --> 00:28:24,250
So...

607
00:28:26,125 --> 00:28:27,416
- Truce?
- Truce.

608
00:28:28,666 --> 00:28:31,083
Hey, the other day in the cab, um,

609
00:28:31,166 --> 00:28:35,208
you were talking about how,
you know, your career is riding on this.

610
00:28:35,291 --> 00:28:36,416
Yeah, 'cause it is.

611
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:38,916
This is super lame... Lame!

612
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,250
...but I Googled you,

613
00:28:41,333 --> 00:28:43,625
and you're kind of a big deal.

614
00:28:43,708 --> 00:28:46,125
You know, I don't get any of this.

615
00:28:46,208 --> 00:28:50,791
Shit. You saw that I went through
a terrible breakup, got fired from my job,

616
00:28:50,875 --> 00:28:53,750
and have been enduring

617
00:28:53,833 --> 00:28:56,416
painful, vicious memes of myself

618
00:28:56,500 --> 00:28:58,000
for over a year.

619
00:28:58,083 --> 00:29:01,000
- That was all on the first page.
- It was my rock bottom.

620
00:29:01,625 --> 00:29:05,750
- Is that from Rock Bottom?
- No more personal questions. Okay.

621
00:29:05,833 --> 00:29:09,500
Why you got a picture of your grandma?
She kind of fine. That's all I'm sayin'.

622
00:29:11,375 --> 00:29:13,166
- [Jenna] Stop.
- [Eric] Ah.

623
00:29:13,708 --> 00:29:16,958
Nah. Nah, I'm just kidding. Gotcha.

624
00:29:17,041 --> 00:29:18,625
That's Nina Mae McKinney,

625
00:29:18,708 --> 00:29:22,083
star of <i>Hallelujah,</i>
first all-Black film in 1929.

626
00:29:22,166 --> 00:29:24,250
- They called her the Black Garbo.
- Black Garbo.

627
00:29:24,791 --> 00:29:27,500
Yeah. She does kind of favor you though.

628
00:29:27,583 --> 00:29:28,583
You think?

629
00:29:29,166 --> 00:29:30,416
Yeah, same cheeks.

630
00:29:31,583 --> 00:29:32,583
Thank you.

631
00:29:34,041 --> 00:29:37,666
I'm kind of obsessed with her.
I mean, she was such a trailblazer, and...

632
00:29:38,833 --> 00:29:40,791
I don't know.
I just love old Hollywood movies.

633
00:29:40,875 --> 00:29:42,250
Likewise.

634
00:29:42,333 --> 00:29:45,041
It's like time traveling
to a version of humanity.

635
00:29:45,125 --> 00:29:47,250
I could have never imagined this.

636
00:29:47,333 --> 00:29:48,583
Look at you.

637
00:29:49,916 --> 00:29:53,833
Seriously, I've... I've never met anyone
who knows anything about Nina Mae.

638
00:29:55,916 --> 00:29:58,041
Master's in film from USC, remember?

639
00:29:58,125 --> 00:29:59,458
Put to good use.

640
00:30:00,041 --> 00:30:02,125
Jenna, your dress came in.

641
00:30:02,208 --> 00:30:05,125
Oh, yeah. You can put it right over there.
Thank you.

642
00:30:05,708 --> 00:30:10,250
- Ha! Perks of the gig.
- [Eric] Hmm.

643
00:30:10,333 --> 00:30:13,666
Yes, a showroom sent over this sample.

644
00:30:13,750 --> 00:30:16,166
- What do you think?
- It's nice. Special occasion?

645
00:30:16,250 --> 00:30:17,916
Yeah, I'm throwing a little dinner party.

646
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,333
My friends are setting me up with someone.

647
00:30:20,416 --> 00:30:23,375
Oh. Okay, so you out here?

648
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,000
You should come.

649
00:30:25,708 --> 00:30:27,416
You want <i>me</i> to come?

650
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:30,958
You should come to my dinner party.
Bring your friends. More the merrier.

651
00:30:31,041 --> 00:30:33,708
Okay, so now you trippin'.
My friends? You sure?

652
00:30:33,791 --> 00:30:36,041
Yeah, I mean, now that we're friends,

653
00:30:36,125 --> 00:30:38,083
you know,
your friends are my friends, right?

654
00:30:38,166 --> 00:30:39,916
It'll take the pressure off. I promise.

655
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,916
All right. We'll come through.

656
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,000
Great.

657
00:30:44,166 --> 00:30:46,166
- [laughing]
- Mm-hmm.

658
00:30:46,250 --> 00:30:48,875
Oh, I miss these Jenna parties,

659
00:30:48,958 --> 00:30:51,208
and it's the perfect way
for you to meet the guy.

660
00:30:51,291 --> 00:30:55,333
Yes, and we're all about to get real good
and saucy real soon.

661
00:30:55,416 --> 00:30:56,416
All right.

662
00:30:57,083 --> 00:30:59,250
- This is needed for the occasion.
- Okay.

663
00:30:59,333 --> 00:31:02,375
All right. Billie, here. Little shot.

664
00:31:03,250 --> 00:31:04,250
- [clears throat]
- What?

665
00:31:04,333 --> 00:31:05,541
- It's good.
- Okay.

666
00:31:05,625 --> 00:31:06,958
But... But what'd you put in it?

667
00:31:07,041 --> 00:31:09,208
Don't worry about it. Just keep drinking.

668
00:31:09,791 --> 00:31:11,000
I gotta pace myself.

669
00:31:12,083 --> 00:31:14,250
- [doorbell rings]
- [woman] Mmm. Mmm.

670
00:31:14,333 --> 00:31:16,166
- So we gotta turn up.
- Yep, just turn up.

671
00:31:16,250 --> 00:31:18,333
- All right, let's go.
- "Milly Rock." Ding-dong!

672
00:31:18,416 --> 00:31:19,708
[laughs]

673
00:31:20,291 --> 00:31:22,458
- Come on up!
- Okay. Okay, we got this.

674
00:31:22,541 --> 00:31:23,375
[woman] All right.

675
00:31:23,458 --> 00:31:25,375
- [Jenna] Hey!
- Yo. What up?

676
00:31:25,958 --> 00:31:26,958
[Jenna] How are you?

677
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,250
[both chuckle]

678
00:31:28,333 --> 00:31:30,250
Uh, this is my boy, Tim,
and his girl, Carlita.

00:39:28,458 --> 00:39:29,458
what do you want?

851
00:39:33,291 --> 00:39:35,666
Like, in life?

852
00:39:37,041 --> 00:39:38,291
You know what I mean.

853
00:39:39,958 --> 00:39:40,958
What do you want?

854
00:39:45,208 --> 00:39:46,208
Uh...

855
00:39:50,333 --> 00:39:54,333
You know that Greta Garbo movie
when she, um, plays the seductress?

856
00:39:54,416 --> 00:39:56,208
[Eric] <i>Flesh and the Devil,</i> 1926.

857
00:39:56,291 --> 00:39:58,651
[Jenna] You know that scene
in the church, during communion?

858
00:39:58,708 --> 00:39:59,541
[Eric] Of course.

859
00:39:59,625 --> 00:40:03,458
And she takes the chalice
that he just drank from,

860
00:40:04,875 --> 00:40:06,166
and she caresses it.

861
00:40:06,250 --> 00:40:07,250
Mmm.

862
00:40:07,583 --> 00:40:12,500
And then she sucks from the same spot.
[scoffs]

863
00:40:13,375 --> 00:40:15,791
- It's profane!
- [Eric] It's profane as fuck.

864
00:40:15,875 --> 00:40:16,750
It is.

865
00:40:16,833 --> 00:40:19,458
- [Jenna] But it's pure, you know?
- [Eric] Yeah.

866
00:40:20,041 --> 00:40:22,625
I wanna love so desperately

867
00:40:22,708 --> 00:40:25,291
it's obscene.

868
00:40:26,083 --> 00:40:27,291
- You know?
- Hmm.

869
00:40:28,083 --> 00:40:31,291
I wanna love so intense

870
00:40:31,375 --> 00:40:34,583
it makes people uncomfortable
to be around us.

871
00:40:35,541 --> 00:40:37,500
- Hmm.
- That's what I want.

872
00:40:41,041 --> 00:40:41,875
What?

873
00:40:41,958 --> 00:40:43,625
- [chuckles]
- What?

874
00:40:45,291 --> 00:40:46,708
Nothing. Nothing. Nothing.

Good morning.
Hey, I, um, wanted to talk to you about...

909
00:42:32,750 --> 00:42:35,166
Eric, I'm about to save Darzine.

910
00:42:35,958 --> 00:42:37,416
Oh, do tell.

911
00:42:37,500 --> 00:42:40,958
Yeah, so I was staring at the poster,
thinking about last night,

912
00:42:41,041 --> 00:42:43,583
you know,
and our mutual love of old movies.

913
00:42:43,666 --> 00:42:47,458
- Oh, that's what you were thinking about?
- Yes, Eric. Movies.

914
00:42:48,875 --> 00:42:51,750
- Okay, Jenna, what hit you?
- Nostalgia. Right?

915
00:42:51,833 --> 00:42:53,333
Every time I watch an old movie,

916
00:42:53,416 --> 00:42:56,625
there's always going to be one garment
that I'm like, "I would kill for that."

917
00:42:56,708 --> 00:43:00,541
Like a bathrobe
or a spectacularly tailored dress

918
00:43:00,625 --> 00:43:04,416
or a gold belt or a fur muff.
Then you're always left thinking...

919
00:43:04,500 --> 00:43:06,333
"They don't make things
like they used to."

920
00:43:06,416 --> 00:43:08,458
But what if they did? What if they did?

921
00:43:08,541 --> 00:43:11,916
Last weekend, I met a designer who makes
the most fabulously constructed items,

922
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:13,833
and they're all reclaimed vintage.

923
00:43:13,916 --> 00:43:16,875
Her craftsmanship is couture-level.

924
00:43:17,583 --> 00:43:19,500
- Okay, no, I like where this is going.
- Okay.

925
00:43:19,583 --> 00:43:20,625
[Eric] But we need a hook.

926
00:43:20,708 --> 00:43:24,375
You know, what's the cool factor,
the influencer, the it-girl viral goal?

927
00:43:24,458 --> 00:43:27,000
- Like, who is that?
- Right. Um...

928
00:43:31,583 --> 00:43:32,583
Remy!

929
00:43:33,791 --> 00:43:35,125
[Eric] Oh shit. That's Remy Ma.

930
00:43:35,625 --> 00:43:38,458
Mama, thank you. Thank you.

931
00:43:38,541 --> 00:43:40,625
Of course. Anything for you.
You know that.

932
00:43:40,708 --> 00:43:42,208
- And thank you, Becca.
- Of course.

933
00:43:42,291 --> 00:43:44,416
Okay, I like this. This is good.

934
00:43:44,500 --> 00:43:46,166

And you're welcome.

You know, for obvious reasons,

996
00:46:48,958 --> 00:46:52,041
I think we should just leave it behind us.

997
00:46:54,333 --> 00:46:55,333
Why?

998
00:46:56,250 --> 00:47:00,041
Do I have to spell it out for you?
Five letters. Starts with a D.

999
00:47:01,250 --> 00:47:03,583
Come on, now. My mom doesn't run us.

1000
00:47:04,416 --> 00:47:06,125
Like, honestly,
we can start our own thing.

1001
00:47:06,208 --> 00:47:09,625
We could take over this whole film
and fashion scene. These are our ideas.

1002
00:47:09,708 --> 00:47:11,541
Yes, they may be our ideas,

1003
00:47:11,625 --> 00:47:15,833
but they will go nowhere without
a real, legit company to put them into.

1004
00:47:17,583 --> 00:47:21,833
Look, your mom may be a raving narcissist,
but it has put her at the top of the game.

1005
00:47:21,916 --> 00:47:25,333
Wow! I never thought
I'd hear you defend her.

1006
00:47:25,416 --> 00:47:26,958
- No, I'm not defending her.
- Wow.

1007
00:47:27,041 --> 00:47:30,875
But I'm saying my future
is now attached to hers.

1008
00:47:32,583 --> 00:47:34,000
And what future is that?

1009
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:37,500
A future of respect

1010
00:47:38,041 --> 00:47:41,208
and making a name for myself

1011
00:47:41,291 --> 00:47:45,375
and having more than four walls
to come home to. That future.

1012
00:47:46,916 --> 00:47:49,166
- I respect you and all your walls.

1014
00:47:51,875 --> 00:47:53,476
- Why are you like this?
- I'm just saying.

1015
00:47:53,500 --> 00:47:55,291
I know a good thing when I see one.

1016
00:47:57,333 --> 00:47:58,708
And I think you do too.

1017
00:48:03,333 --> 00:48:06,208
I am inclined to recognize

1018
00:48:07,541 --> 00:48:10,583
when positive action

That was nice.

1043
00:49:14,666 --> 00:49:17,875
I... I didn't know
older women, you know, got the Brazilians.

1044
00:49:17,958 --> 00:49:22,250
Why would you think I would have, like,
a '70s bush? How old do you think I am?

It's just like, it is what it is.

1049

is not the same thing as, like,

embracing the aesthetic.

1051
00:49:38,500 --> 00:49:41,875
I noticed the screaming eagle or whatever
is in the middle of your chest.

1052
00:49:41,958 --> 00:49:42,833
Screaming eagle.

1053
00:49:42,916 --> 00:49:43,750
What is that?

1054
00:49:43,833 --> 00:49:47,208
- I couldn't identify what type of bird.
- [laughs]

1055
00:49:47,791 --> 00:49:49,791
It's a, um... It's a dove, actually.

1056
00:49:50,666 --> 00:49:52,708

1057
00:49:53,291 --> 00:49:54,458
[Eric] Uh...

1058
00:49:54,541 --> 00:49:55,750
Otis is, um...

1059
00:49:57,166 --> 00:49:59,333
- It's my dad.
- [Jenna] Hmm.

1060
00:49:59,416 --> 00:50:00,666
Yep, my faja.

1061
00:50:01,375 --> 00:50:03,250
I never heard you talk about your dad.

1062
00:50:04,125 --> 00:50:07,125
Yeah, um, he, uh... He died, so...

1063
00:50:08,833 --> 00:50:09,833
I'm sorry.

1064
00:50:12,083 --> 00:50:14,458
Yeah, nah. Nah.
He was killed when I was two.

1065
00:50:15,166 --> 00:50:16,166
My God.

1066
00:50:16,958 --> 00:50:19,458
This is just getting worse.
What... What happened?

1067
00:50:20,208 --> 00:50:24,250
Well, I mean, of course,
I don't remember much,

1068
00:50:24,333 --> 00:50:26,208
but he was, uh...
He was mixed up in some mess.

1069
00:50:26,291 --> 00:50:27,666
He was in the streets, so...

1070
00:50:28,750 --> 00:50:30,791
That must've been hard
for you and your mom.

1071
00:50:31,583 --> 00:50:36,541
Yeah. I mean, I wouldn't know.
She isn't exactly an open book about it.

1072
00:50:37,041 --> 00:50:40,291
You know, I caught her crying once,

1073
00:50:40,375 --> 00:50:42,000
but then, like, never again.

1074
00:50:42,083 --> 00:50:43,791
And I don't wanna upset her,

1075
00:50:43,875 --> 00:50:46,958
so it's really just been about me
trying to piece things together,

1076
00:50:47,041 --> 00:50:48,625
figure it out myself.

1077
00:50:48,708 --> 00:50:49,916
You know, I keep my distance,

1078
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:52,750
especially when it comes to,
you know, my dad.

1079
00:50:52,833 --> 00:50:55,166
But... yeah.

1080
00:50:56,208 --> 00:50:57,208
That's a lot.

1081
00:50:58,375 --> 00:51:01,875
It is a lot.
But, you know, I don't know. I mean...

1082
00:51:01,958 --> 00:51:05,500
Maybe she's just missing
that parenting chip, you know?

1083
00:51:06,958 --> 00:51:08,208
I probably am too.

1084
00:51:08,750 --> 00:51:09,791
- No.
- [chuckles]

1085
00:51:09,875 --> 00:51:12,208
Nah, really. My movies will be my kids.

1086
00:51:14,208 --> 00:51:17,041
Yeah, I definitely see that.

1088

Oh man.

1089
00:51:22,541 --> 00:51:28,416
Seriously, though, I'm... I'm thinking about
doing a film about my pops.

1090
00:51:28,500 --> 00:51:29,333
Yeah?

1091
00:51:29,416 --> 00:51:31,583
About his life, though, not his death.

1092
00:51:31,666 --> 00:51:36,250
I wanna just celebrate who he was
and, you know, his life. Yeah.

1093
00:51:36,833 --> 00:51:38,125
That sounds incredible.

1094
00:51:39,458 --> 00:51:40,458

What happened with Mr. Rock Bottom?

1102
00:52:01,875 --> 00:52:06,041
Well, we met in college.
We were both crazy overachievers.

1103
00:52:07,208 --> 00:52:09,333
And we were dating and...

1104
00:52:09,416 --> 00:52:12,291
It was so good and great,

1105
00:52:12,375 --> 00:52:16,166
and then we became,
like, this, like, thing, you know?

1106
00:52:16,250 --> 00:52:17,375
Mm-hmm.

1107
00:52:17,458 --> 00:52:19,041
This power couple.

1108
00:52:19,125 --> 00:52:22,125
And we're moving and grooving,
and the next thing I know,

1109
00:52:22,208 --> 00:52:24,958
ten years have gone by,
and I'm like, "Wait, hold up."

1110
00:52:26,416 --> 00:52:28,541
"This fool has been stringing me along."

1111
00:52:28,625 --> 00:52:30,041
I just wanted more.

1112

1113

given up on my dream.

- Mm-hmm.

1122

- Oh my God.
- What?

1125
00:53:01,833 --> 00:53:04,291
Ten years ago, you had a lab partner.

1126

- Oh my God.
- And a locker.

1127

00:55:51,458 --> 00:55:52,541
Cute. Research?

1193
00:55:52,625 --> 00:55:54,583
Cute. Okay.

1194
00:55:55,208 --> 00:55:57,208
It's cute though. I ship it.

We took the liberty
of reading it on your behalf.

1205
00:56:28,125 --> 00:56:28,958
Mm-hmm.

1206
00:56:29,041 --> 00:56:30,916
Would you like the highlights?

1207
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:32,791
Hurry. Bad news first.

1208
00:56:32,875 --> 00:56:35,375
- There is no bad news.

but the life I made here

[both] Aw.

1214
00:56:55,625 --> 00:56:58,250
I mean, it sounds like
somebody misses somebody.

I was gone for over a year
and did not hear from him once.

00:57:03,208 --> 00:57:04,791
- Yikes.
- I gotta go.

1217

- Shut up.

Hey, Darcy, how are you?

1223
00:57:20,666 --> 00:57:24,208
I want you to guess
what my brilliance has conjured up.

1224
00:57:26,625 --> 00:57:28,166
- Go on.
- No idea.

1225
00:57:28,250 --> 00:57:29,416
Try.

1226
00:57:30,916 --> 00:57:33,041
A call from the <i>New York Times</i>.

1227
00:57:33,708 --> 00:57:38,166
They wanna profile me
as a... a publishing mastermind,

1228
00:57:38,250 --> 00:57:39,500
a media mogul.

1229
00:57:40,833 --> 00:57:41,666
Oh.

1230
00:57:41,750 --> 00:57:43,958
Darcy, that's... that's huge.
That's awesome.

1231
00:57:44,041 --> 00:57:47,500
They wanted details on Perfect Find.
I told them that was your brainchild.

1232
00:57:47,583 --> 00:57:49,083
Well, mine and Eric's, yes.

1233
00:57:49,166 --> 00:57:50,833
Yes, the two of you.

1234
00:57:52,125 --> 00:57:54,500
You've been doing brilliant work together.

1235
00:57:54,583 --> 00:57:58,166
Yeah, no, thank you for giving me
this shot and for pairing me with him.

1236
00:57:58,250 --> 00:57:59,083
Thank you.

1237
00:57:59,166 --> 00:58:02,416
Yes, I did that, didn't I?
I combined the two of you.

1238
00:58:03,041 --> 00:58:05,666
You did. You have amazing instincts.

1239
00:58:05,750 --> 00:58:08,333
I do. I do.

1240
00:58:08,416 --> 00:58:12,000
Yeah, he's... he's really talented.
You should be very proud.

1241
00:58:12,083 --> 00:58:15,208
Oh, I am. Very. Are you?

1242
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:19,166
- Am I what?
- Are you proud of my son?

1243
00:58:20,500 --> 00:58:23,833
Yeah. Yeah. Proud of the work
that we do together.

1244
00:58:23,916 --> 00:58:25,625
- Sure. Yeah.
- He does seem motivated.

1245
00:58:25,708 --> 00:58:28,125
Well, that's just post-grad excitement.
You know.

1246
00:58:28,208 --> 00:58:30,375
And pleasing you.

1247
00:58:32,125 --> 00:58:36,291
You must know that Eric has a small crush.

1248
00:58:37,750 --> 00:58:39,166
- Really?

1249
00:58:39,250 --> 00:58:43,541
Okay. Well, I've never seen him
so focused and dedicated.

1250
00:58:43,625 --> 00:58:44,458
Girl, that's you.

1251
00:58:44,541 --> 00:58:48,000
That ain't nothing but good home training
and a quality education.

1252
00:58:48,083 --> 00:58:49,916
I mean, yes, clearly.

1253
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:52,208
Clearly, working so closely
with a powerful woman

1254
00:58:52,291 --> 00:58:55,416
that echoes his mother is a factor,

1255
00:58:55,500 --> 00:58:58,500
but let's just cut the shit, Jenna.

1256
00:58:59,541 --> 00:59:03,125
Getting the job well done is great.

1257
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:06,958
But we don't need this moving any further
into some kind of...

1258
00:59:08,750 --> 00:59:10,000
distraction.

1259
00:59:10,791 --> 00:59:13,291
Darcy, I promise you.

1260
00:59:14,500 --> 00:59:17,166
There is no distraction.

1261
00:59:21,250 --> 00:59:22,083

01:23:36,416 --> 01:23:39,041
You took your time,
and now I'm taking mine, all right?

1695
01:23:39,125 --> 01:23:41,208
I don't wanna sit here
and yell at a pregnant lady,

1696
01:23:41,291 --> 01:23:42,833
so I'm gonna excuse myself, okay?

[woman] <i>Sweetheart, let me tell you.</i>

1699
01:24:04,083 --> 01:24:08,583
Don't worry about gaining weight
because, honey, Mother weighed 250 pounds,

1700
01:24:08,666 --> 01:24:10,546
and you only weighed
eight pounds, eight ounces.

1701
01:24:10,583 --> 01:24:12,416
<i>Your father would take me
to the restaurant,</i>

1702
01:24:12,500 --> 01:24:15,541
<i>and I would not only have
one dinner, I had six.</i>

1703
01:24:15,625 --> 01:24:18,625
And when it was time to have you, mm,

1704
01:24:19,458 --> 01:24:23,250
I had to wear your daddy's shoes,
'cause my feet swelled up so big.

1705
01:24:23,333 --> 01:24:26,708
So, listen,
I can come out there and help you.

1706
01:24:26,791 --> 01:24:28,625
You're gonna need help, honey.

1707
01:24:28,708 --> 01:24:30,833
Oh, I'd like that, Mom. Thanks.

1708
01:24:31,833 --> 01:24:34,208
Have you heard from the father?

1709
01:24:34,916 --> 01:24:37,875
No. Not since I told him, no.

1710
01:24:38,416 --> 01:24:41,625
You know, I'm just gonna give him space.
I kind of caught him off guard.

1711
01:24:41,708 --> 01:24:44,333
Sweetheart, don't make excuses
for that man, okay?

1712
01:24:44,416 --> 01:24:47,250
- Yeah.
- It takes two to tango, right?

1713
01:24:47,333 --> 01:24:49,541
- You didn't do this by yourself.
- Mom, don't go there.

1714
01:24:49,625 --> 01:24:51,083
You didn't get yourself pregnant.

1715
01:24:51,166 --> 01:24:53,601
- [doorbell rings]
- That might be the pillow that I sent you.

1716
01:24:53,625 --> 01:24:54,750
Oh, okay. Hold on.

1717
01:24:54,833 --> 01:24:57,458
I had to sleep on a full-body pillow
when I was having you.

1718
01:24:57,541 --> 01:24:59,875
Only time I could get
any kind of shut-eye,

1719
01:24:59,958 --> 01:25:02,958

in my damn stomach.

Good morning, Jenna.

1724
01:25:20,500 --> 01:25:22,541
Sorry to drop in on you like this,

1725
01:25:22,625 --> 01:25:26,500
but drastic circumstances
call for drastic measures.

1726

[Jenna's mom] <i>I sat on a washing machine
to try to get you going into labor.</i>

1727
01:25:30,708 --> 01:25:33,208
Uh, it's not the pillow, Mom.
Can I call you back?

1728
01:25:33,291 --> 01:25:35,125
Okay. Love you.

1729
01:25:35,208 --> 01:25:36,708
Okay, bye.

1730
01:25:40,916 --> 01:25:42,291
Darcy, what do you want?

1731
01:25:42,916 --> 01:25:46,750
You've really outdone yourself, Jenna.
Making me a grandmother.

1732
01:25:46,833 --> 01:25:49,708
Can't say that I was thinking
about you in that moment, but...

1733
01:25:49,791 --> 01:25:51,541
There's a profile...

1734
01:25:53,375 --> 01:25:55,750
for women who self-sabotage.

1735
01:25:55,833 --> 01:25:59,375
Yeah, I... I think there's also
a profile on maternal narcissists,

1736
01:25:59,458 --> 01:26:00,750
but who's counting?

1737
01:26:01,375 --> 01:26:02,375
Hmm. Nose job?

1738
01:26:03,708 --> 01:26:08,291
Do you plan to live here?
Raise my grandchild in this?

1739
01:26:08,375 --> 01:26:11,166
- Can we just stop? Can we just stop?
- Okay. Fine.

1740
01:26:11,250 --> 01:26:13,041
I'm not playing
this game with you anymore.

1741
01:26:13,125 --> 01:26:14,000
Fine.

1742
01:26:14,083 --> 01:26:18,916
This... This documentary
that Eric is filming, was that you?

1743
01:26:19,000 --> 01:26:22,291
No. This is something
he wants to do for himself.

1744
01:26:22,375 --> 01:26:26,125
- It's his story. He has a right to know.
- Yeah, and I have a right not to tell him.

1745
01:26:29,458 --> 01:26:30,458
Maybe.

1746
01:26:33,458 --> 01:26:35,958
Maybe now that you're a mother,
you might understand.

1747
01:26:36,750 --> 01:26:37,750
Maybe I will.

1748
01:26:38,833 --> 01:26:40,875
You know,
I was in a very different position

1749
01:26:42,125 --> 01:26:43,916
than you are when I had Eric.

1750
01:26:45,125 --> 01:26:47,166
Ooh, my parents hated his father.

01:26:47,250 --> 01:26:48,875
Everything about him.

1752
01:26:50,666 --> 01:26:53,166
Hated the crowd he ran with.
Thought I was...

1753
01:26:55,333 --> 01:26:56,333
too young,

1754
01:26:57,208 --> 01:26:58,250
which I was.

1755
01:26:59,958 --> 01:27:01,458
Oh, but I loved that man.

1756
01:27:03,833 --> 01:27:05,291
And I wanted our son.

Oh, and Eric was the most beautiful baby.

1760
01:27:24,458 --> 01:27:26,583
And when his father was killed...

1761
01:27:30,291 --> 01:27:32,208
my parents didn't come to the funeral.

1762
01:27:35,750 --> 01:27:40,791
So it's... it's just been
the two of us ever since.

1763
01:27:44,375 --> 01:27:46,916
- I'm so sorry.
- Don't you dare feel sorry for me.

1764
01:27:49,625 --> 01:27:51,000
Made me stronger.

1765
01:27:51,666 --> 01:27:57,375
My fierceness as a mother
became my fierceness professionally,

1766
01:27:58,166 --> 01:28:00,666
because I had him to fight for.

1767
01:28:01,666 --> 01:28:03,208
I had a son to raise.

1768
01:28:04,250 --> 01:28:05,291
