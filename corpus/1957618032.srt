she asks her friend, what
exactly is an affair?

722
00:43:08,233 --> 00:43:12,233
An affair, my darling, is when
a man and a woman get together,

723
00:43:12,233 --> 00:43:16,800
at least one of them married,
and exchange sexual favors.

724
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:17,500
Right.

725
00:43:17,500 --> 00:43:20,100
I'm not having an affair.

726
00:43:20,100 --> 00:43:23,300
Through the magic
of this phone line,

727
00:43:23,300 --> 00:43:26,166
she can have an adventure,
and then the adventure

728
00:43:26,166 --> 00:43:29,200
becomes sexual, and
then it becomes loving.

729
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:31,333
That's, I think, the
journey that it takes.

730
00:43:31,333 --> 00:43:34,200
Already a multimillion
dollar industry in America,

731
00:43:34,200 --> 00:43:36,633
phone sex, according
to the filmmakers,

732
00:43:36,633 --> 00:43:41,300
appeals to our desires for
both intimacy and isolation.

733
00:43:41,300 --> 00:43:44,567
It also serves as an appropriate
backdrop for a film dedicated

734
00:43:44,567 --> 00:43:46,166
to combating AIDS.

735
00:43:46,166 --> 00:43:51,000
The single most difficult
and prevalent aspect

736
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:56,367
of sexuality in the
age of AIDS is fear.

737
00:43:56,367 --> 00:44:00,934
People have equated fear
with sex, sex with death.

738
00:44:00,934 --> 00:44:03,333
And something that
for a lot of people

739
00:44:03,333 --> 00:44:07,800
was fun and interesting and
thrilling, and all of that,

740
00:44:07,800 --> 00:44:13,700
became dangerous and
dark and just fraught

741
00:44:13,700 --> 00:44:15,233
with all kinds of problems.

742
00:44:15,233 --> 00:44:22,700
So phone sex, if nothing else,
is the safest sex imaginable.

743
00:44:22,700 --> 00:44:24,734
You're beautiful.

744
00:44:24,734 --> 00:44:27,333
No, I think you're beautiful.

745
00:44:27,333 --> 00:44:28,700
No, you are.

746
00:44:28,700 --> 00:44:31,100
No, really, you are.

747
00:44:31,100 --> 00:44:32,800
[LAUGHS]

748
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:36,500
I don't think that
phone sex will

749
00:44:36,500 --> 00:44:39,934
be the wave of the future
for our relationships

750
00:44:39,934 --> 00:44:41,333
or intimacy with people.

751
00:44:41,333 --> 00:44:44,333
I think it happens
to be the thing

752
00:44:44,333 --> 00:44:52,000
of the late '80s, early '90s,
like the pet rock of intimacy.

753
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:55,033
It's a clever trick
that someone thought up

754
00:44:55,033 --> 00:45:01,000
to play off of everybody's
fear in relation

755
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:03,433
to getting to know someone or
having a sexual relationship

756
00:45:03,433 --> 00:45:04,033
with someone.

757
00:45:04,033 --> 00:45:06,400
If the '90s are
producing relationships

758
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:08,800
as unnaturally
distant as this one,

759
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:11,400
they are also producing
some benefits.

760
00:45:11,400 --> 00:45:13,633
As horrible as the
AIDS epidemic is,

761
00:45:13,633 --> 00:45:15,867
it's done a couple of things
that, in certain people's

762
00:45:15,867 --> 00:45:17,033
minds, are very positive.

763
00:45:17,033 --> 00:45:20,867
It's done wonders for
monogamous relationships.

764
00:45:20,867 --> 00:45:24,433
It's really made people
reassess their sexual values,

765
00:45:24,433 --> 00:45:28,133
their sexual morals,
their sexual activity.

766
00:45:28,133 --> 00:45:30,367
And there's a lot more
relationships happening,

767
00:45:30,367 --> 00:45:32,066
as opposed to couplings.

768
00:45:32,066 --> 00:45:35,400
And in a town notorious
for its inflated salaries

769
00:45:35,400 --> 00:45:37,934
and inflated egos,
the crisis has also

770
00:45:37,934 --> 00:45:40,800
brought out some very
positive impulses.

771
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:45,667
I'm very impressed with
this group of people.

772
00:45:45,667 --> 00:45:47,967
My face will be out
there, so in that sense,

773
00:45:47,967 --> 00:45:49,533
professionally, I
get that out of it.

774
00:45:49,533 --> 00:45:52,133
But these people are
donating their time

775
00:45:52,133 --> 00:45:54,533
because they feel like
it's a good thing to do,

776
00:45:54,533 --> 00:45:58,066
and I find that
pretty remarkable.

777
00:45:58,066 --> 00:46:01,066
Sexual Healing, premiering July
18th, exclusively on Showtime.

778
00:46:09,800 --> 00:46:13,233
Back in the early '90s, I
had written and rewritten

779
00:46:13,233 --> 00:46:16,200
a number of scripts, and I
was at that point in my career

780
00:46:16,200 --> 00:46:19,200
where I wanted to become
a director as well.

781
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:21,467
And I also knew that
there was no reason

782
00:46:21,467 --> 00:46:23,700
anyone should believe
that I could do that,

783
00:46:23,700 --> 00:46:27,767
and so I set out to do what
many people in that position do,

784
00:46:27,767 --> 00:46:29,734
which is make a short film.

785
00:46:29,734 --> 00:46:33,934
And I wanted to choose a subject
matter that really lent itself

786
00:46:33,934 --> 00:46:36,433
to that length, and
that also created

787
00:46:36,433 --> 00:46:39,333
a challenge for me to overcome.

788
00:46:39,333 --> 00:46:42,600
Now, the world of phone sex was
really interesting back then.

789
00:46:42,600 --> 00:46:45,400
There wasn't computers
and Skype and chat rooms

790
00:46:45,400 --> 00:46:47,767
and cyber this and that.

791
00:46:47,767 --> 00:46:52,233
Really, it was all about
individuals being able to hook

792
00:46:52,233 --> 00:46:55,200
up with other individuals,
not professionals.

793
00:46:55,200 --> 00:46:58,233
And it created a tremendous
amount of intimacy,

794
00:46:58,233 --> 00:47:01,467
on the one hand, because
your phone receivers make

795
00:47:01,467 --> 00:47:03,700
you brain to brain,
but at the same time,

796
00:47:03,700 --> 00:47:05,934
there's complete
distance and anonymity.

797
00:47:05,934 --> 00:47:08,834
So that's what led me
to the subject matter

798
00:47:08,834 --> 00:47:12,567
and the treatment
of Sexual Healing.

799
00:47:12,567 --> 00:47:18,834
Also, what I wanted to do
was create a real closeness,

800
00:47:18,834 --> 00:47:21,533
and I wanted the
audience to really care

801
00:47:21,533 --> 00:47:24,467
about the relationship
between these two characters

802
00:47:24,467 --> 00:47:28,400
who never meet in person until
the very end of the film.

803
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:31,400
And my hope was that producers
and studios would say,

804
00:47:31,400 --> 00:47:32,000
wait a minute.

805
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,567
This guy got us to care about
two people who were never

806
00:47:34,567 --> 00:47:37,433
even in the same
room, and so maybe we

807
00:47:37,433 --> 00:47:39,000
should give him a
shot with people who

808
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:41,200
actually are in the same room.

809
00:47:41,200 --> 00:47:43,033
And one interesting
note about that

810
00:47:43,033 --> 00:47:47,400
is that when we shot the film,
we use this special device so

811
00:47:47,400 --> 00:47:50,934
that we couldn't use
actual phone lines,

812
00:47:50,934 --> 00:47:55,200
but we had the characters on
phones, never in the same room.

813
00:47:55,200 --> 00:47:57,600
So as much as
possible, we simulated

814
00:47:57,600 --> 00:48:01,033
the world of phone sex as
it existed at that time.

815
00:48:07,967 --> 00:48:10,700
When you make a short
film, basically everyone

816
00:48:10,700 --> 00:48:13,633
has to work for free, and
you're pulling in every favor

817
00:48:13,633 --> 00:48:15,200
that you can and
you're asking people

818
00:48:15,200 --> 00:48:17,533
to extend themselves
on their own time,

819
00:48:17,533 --> 00:48:19,633
and I was a little
uncomfortable with that.

820
00:48:19,633 --> 00:48:22,300
I wasn't such a good asker.

821
00:48:22,300 --> 00:48:24,567
And at the same
time, I had a career

822
00:48:24,567 --> 00:48:27,633
previously as an
activist for human rights

823
00:48:27,633 --> 00:48:29,033
and the environment.

824
00:48:29,033 --> 00:48:31,734
And so I came up with
the idea of creating

825
00:48:31,734 --> 00:48:37,133
the film as a fundraiser for
the Minority AIDS Project.

826
00:48:37,133 --> 00:48:38,867
And this was a
little bit strange.

827
00:48:38,867 --> 00:48:40,333
It had never been done before.

828
00:48:40,333 --> 00:48:42,700
And there was a real good
reason why it hadn't been done,

829
00:48:42,700 --> 00:48:45,700
and that is that there
was no market, really,

830
00:48:45,700 --> 00:48:46,967
for short films.

831
00:48:46,967 --> 00:48:48,967
You could go on the
festival circuit, of course,

832
00:48:48,967 --> 00:48:50,700
but you don't make
any money doing that.

833
00:48:50,700 --> 00:48:54,033
So some people wondered, was it
a trick, a gimmick, et cetera?

834
00:48:54,033 --> 00:48:56,400
But I had this feeling
that if we pulled it off,

835
00:48:56,400 --> 00:48:58,266
somehow there would
be a market for it

836
00:48:58,266 --> 00:49:01,500
and we would be able to raise
money for the Minority AIDS

837
00:49:01,500 --> 00:49:02,033
Project.

838
00:49:02,033 --> 00:49:05,200
And so that's how I set it up,
and we were off and running.

839
00:49:11,767 --> 00:49:14,600
In the early stages
of preproduction,

840
00:49:14,600 --> 00:49:17,433
I had two actors who were
working with me in the two

841
00:49:17,433 --> 00:49:18,400
lead roles.

842
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:20,233
Both of them were
friends of mine.

843
00:49:20,233 --> 00:49:24,033
Not really famous, but
really high quality actors.

844
00:49:24,033 --> 00:49:27,133
And one of them,
the male lead, I

845
00:49:27,133 --> 00:49:29,567
ended up having a big
creative disagreement with.

846
00:49:29,567 --> 00:49:32,367
And he quit, or I
fired him, or both.

847
00:49:32,367 --> 00:49:33,667
I'm not sure.

848
00:49:33,667 --> 00:49:36,533
And the other one
decided to stay on,

849
00:49:36,533 --> 00:49:38,767
but we had to find
a new male lead.

850
00:49:38,767 --> 00:49:40,467
And I racked my
brain trying to think

851
00:49:40,467 --> 00:49:41,633
of who might be good for it.

852
00:49:41,633 --> 00:49:43,767
And I remembered that,
from my activist days,

853
00:49:43,767 --> 00:49:46,233
I had a good connection
with Anthony Edwards.

854
00:49:46,233 --> 00:49:49,533
So I asked him, and lo and
behold, he read the script.

855
00:49:49,533 --> 00:49:50,100
He liked it.

856
00:49:50,100 --> 00:49:51,567
He said he would do it.

857
00:49:51,567 --> 00:49:53,133
So that was great.

858
00:49:53,133 --> 00:49:54,767
I was really excited
at that point.

859
00:49:54,767 --> 00:49:57,266
And then right before
we started shooting,

860
00:49:57,266 --> 00:50:00,233
my friend, the actress,
got chicken pox

861
00:50:00,233 --> 00:50:02,867
and had to back out
of the whole thing.

862
00:50:02,867 --> 00:50:04,967
So on the one hand,
this was an emergency.

863
00:50:04,967 --> 00:50:05,867
We were all set to go.

864
00:50:05,867 --> 00:50:07,500
What were we going to do?

865
00:50:07,500 --> 00:50:09,100
But it turned out to
be an opportunity,

866
00:50:09,100 --> 00:50:13,533
as well, because I remembered
that one of Anthony Edward's

867
00:50:13,533 --> 00:50:16,867
best friends, who he'd
known for years and years,

868
00:50:16,867 --> 00:50:18,500
was Helen Hunt.

869
00:50:18,500 --> 00:50:20,734
And I asked him,
very tentatively,

870
00:50:20,734 --> 00:50:22,233
if he would ask her.

871
00:50:22,233 --> 00:50:23,100
He did.

872
00:50:23,100 --> 00:50:26,266
She loved the role and
she agreed to do it.

873
00:50:26,266 --> 00:50:29,100
She was in between assignments
and had just the right amount

874
00:50:29,100 --> 00:50:30,133
of time.

875
00:50:30,133 --> 00:50:32,233
The real motivation,
to be honest,

876
00:50:32,233 --> 00:50:34,700
though, was that she
and Tony had never

877
00:50:34,700 --> 00:50:36,266
worked together up
until that time,

878
00:50:36,266 --> 00:50:38,834
and they saw it as their
first chance to do so.

879
00:50:38,834 --> 00:50:41,400
So we also had
Jason Alexander, who

880
00:50:41,400 --> 00:50:45,133
agreed just because
he wanted to help out.

881
00:50:45,133 --> 00:50:47,533
So my little film
went from being one

882
00:50:47,533 --> 00:50:49,200
that probably wouldn't
have been noticed

883
00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:52,333
to having big stars
in it, and that

884
00:50:52,333 --> 00:50:53,967
made a lot of
things a lot easier

885
00:50:53,967 --> 00:50:55,433
as we were getting
ready to shoot.

886
00:51:03,767 --> 00:51:08,700
The first challenge I had in
working skillfully with actors

887
00:51:08,700 --> 00:51:13,033
on a set was when Helen
came to me about one

888
00:51:13,033 --> 00:51:16,633
of the scenes that had her doing
something pretty outlandish.

889
00:51:16,633 --> 00:51:18,533
She was going to
climb up on a table

890
00:51:18,533 --> 00:51:21,433
and she was going
to kind of make

891
00:51:21,433 --> 00:51:23,800
a fool of herself,
in what I thought

892
00:51:23,800 --> 00:51:25,166
was right for the character.

893
00:51:25,166 --> 00:51:26,400
But she didn't.

894
00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:28,934
And she came to me right before
we were all set up to shoot.

895
00:51:28,934 --> 00:51:32,133
And she said, I've been trying
this 100 different ways,

896
00:51:32,133 --> 00:51:34,300
and I have a feeling that
I'm going to commit myself

897
00:51:34,300 --> 00:51:37,066
on camera to something that
I'm going to really regret,

898
00:51:37,066 --> 00:51:39,200
and I don't want to do it.

899
00:51:39,200 --> 00:51:40,734
So I had no idea what to do.

900
00:51:40,734 --> 00:51:43,233
Time was ticking.

901
00:51:43,233 --> 00:51:46,834
The clock and the
money were rolling.

902
00:51:46,834 --> 00:51:50,433
And luckily, Jason
Alexander stepped in

903
00:51:50,433 --> 00:51:53,433
and he said, you know,
when in doubt, shtick.

904
00:51:53,433 --> 00:51:57,700
And that's the scene
you'll see where there's

905
00:51:57,700 --> 00:51:59,734
a spit take, essentially.

906
00:51:59,734 --> 00:52:01,433
And it worked.

907
00:52:01,433 --> 00:52:04,433
It got us through that
one point in the film.

908
00:52:04,433 --> 00:52:06,133
It's still the one
I'm least proud of,

909
00:52:06,133 --> 00:52:08,233
because we had to
think of it on the spot

910
00:52:08,233 --> 00:52:11,133
and it's not exactly true to
the story or the character,

911
00:52:11,133 --> 00:52:13,767
but it's what we
can do at the time.

912
00:52:17,266 --> 00:52:20,633
One other time during the course
of the filming Helen and I

913
00:52:20,633 --> 00:52:23,300
had something we
had to work through,

914
00:52:23,300 --> 00:52:27,734
and this time I felt like it was
important to do it a little bit

915
00:52:27,734 --> 00:52:29,200
indirectly.

916
00:52:29,200 --> 00:52:32,033
So it's the scene
when she's having

917
00:52:32,033 --> 00:52:36,867
phone sex with Tony's character,
and her husband comes home.

918
00:52:36,867 --> 00:52:38,767
And she's really
freaked out about this,

919
00:52:38,767 --> 00:52:41,867
but she's even more freaked
out when Tony says to her,

920
00:52:41,867 --> 00:52:43,233
I know where you live.

921
00:52:43,233 --> 00:52:45,000
I peeled off the sticker.

922
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:47,967
And he's referring to
the return address that

923
00:52:47,967 --> 00:52:50,934
was on the envelope
that she sent him

924
00:52:50,934 --> 00:52:54,066
that she had covered up with
a sticker from her workplace.

925
00:52:54,066 --> 00:52:56,700
And I wanted Helen to have
a really big response,

926
00:52:56,700 --> 00:52:59,533
because it seemed like he was
almost threatening that he was

927
00:52:59,533 --> 00:53:03,300
going to break the
agreement they had

928
00:53:03,300 --> 00:53:05,767
to keep their lives separate,
which would have been really,

929
00:53:05,767 --> 00:53:07,300
really scary for
her at that time,

930
00:53:07,300 --> 00:53:08,934
especially because
she's already filled

931
00:53:08,934 --> 00:53:10,834
with adrenaline because
her husband is just

932
00:53:10,834 --> 00:53:13,000
about to barge in on her.

933
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:14,667
So I just wasn't
getting the intensity

934
00:53:14,667 --> 00:53:16,900
that I hoped for in her
response when he said that.

935
00:53:16,900 --> 00:53:19,367
And I didn't know what to do,
and I talked to Tony about it

936
00:53:19,367 --> 00:53:20,467
at lunch.

937
00:53:20,467 --> 00:53:24,066
And he said, well, I have
an idea that might help you,

938
00:53:24,066 --> 00:53:25,533
but you're going
to be on your own.

939
00:53:25,533 --> 00:53:27,667
I don't know how Helen
is going to react.

940
00:53:27,667 --> 00:53:32,166
And so what we worked out is
that without telling Helen,

941
00:53:32,166 --> 00:53:35,200
that when we shot the
scene in close-up,

942
00:53:35,200 --> 00:53:38,266
instead of saying the
lines as scripted,

943
00:53:38,266 --> 00:53:42,133
Tony made them much more
urgent and menacing.

944
00:53:42,133 --> 00:53:45,166
He said something like,
I know where you live.

945
00:53:45,166 --> 00:53:47,400
I'm going to come there.

946
00:53:47,400 --> 00:53:50,300
And in the moment, Helen,
great actress that she is,

947
00:53:50,300 --> 00:53:53,600
just completely jumped and
gave the perfect reaction.

948
00:53:53,600 --> 00:53:55,867
And then the only
thing left was to see

949
00:53:55,867 --> 00:53:57,900
was she going to be
upset with me afterwards

950
00:53:57,900 --> 00:53:59,834
because of that manipulation?

951
00:53:59,834 --> 00:54:02,300
So we said cut and
there was a pause,

952
00:54:02,300 --> 00:54:03,867
and I'm kind of sweating it out.

953
00:54:03,867 --> 00:54:06,200
She just turned, cool
as a cucumber to Tony

954
00:54:06,200 --> 00:54:08,233
and said, great scene, Tony.

955
00:54:08,233 --> 00:54:10,633
And never spoke of
it again, and I never

956
00:54:10,633 --> 00:54:12,934
checked up about it with her.

957
00:54:12,934 --> 00:54:15,700
So to this day, I don't know
whether she knew what we did

958
00:54:15,700 --> 00:54:19,033
or if she was just so in it,
it didn't even occur to her

959
00:54:19,033 --> 00:54:22,734
that anything was different.

960
00:54:22,734 --> 00:54:26,500
One of the final things we did
on the film was the soundstage,

961
00:54:26,500 --> 00:54:32,834
the post-production, and the
key pieces where the music--

962
00:54:32,834 --> 00:54:34,333
there's a lot of
music in this film.

963
00:54:34,333 --> 00:54:35,767
It was really important to me.

964
00:54:35,767 --> 00:54:38,633
And the song that
had to be in there,

965
00:54:38,633 --> 00:54:41,367
as far as I was concerned,
was "Sexual Healing,"

966
00:54:41,367 --> 00:54:44,800
the Marvin Gaye song, title
of our film, of course.

967
00:54:44,800 --> 00:54:48,200
And we had tried really hard
to get the rights to the song

968
00:54:48,200 --> 00:54:49,633
and we hadn't heard back.

969
00:54:49,633 --> 00:54:52,467
It wasn't a no, we just
didn't hear anything.

970
00:54:52,467 --> 00:54:55,100
And now there was
no time left, and I

971
00:54:55,100 --> 00:54:56,467
knew someone who
knew someone who

972
00:54:56,467 --> 00:54:59,100
knew someone who got in
touch with EMI and said,

973
00:54:59,100 --> 00:55:00,633
what's going on?

974
00:55:00,633 --> 00:55:03,967
And what we found out was is
that the estate of Marvin Gaye

975
00:55:03,967 --> 00:55:07,567
had given us the rights to
the song weeks and weeks ago,

976
00:55:07,567 --> 00:55:11,033
but there was a co-writer
who they couldn't find,

977
00:55:11,033 --> 00:55:13,900
and therefore they
couldn't get his approval.

978
00:55:13,900 --> 00:55:15,867
So they said, the only
way you can use the song

979
00:55:15,867 --> 00:55:19,300
is if you write a letter,
little guy that you are,

980
00:55:19,300 --> 00:55:23,533
indemnifying multibillion
dollar conglomerate EMI

981
00:55:23,533 --> 00:55:27,700
against any possible future
claims from this co-writer.

982
00:55:27,700 --> 00:55:30,033
So I talked to my
lawyer, while I

983
00:55:30,033 --> 00:55:31,500
was right there on
the sound stage,

984
00:55:31,500 --> 00:55:32,934
and my lawyer said, don't do it.

985
00:55:32,934 --> 00:55:34,100
Don't do it.

986
00:55:34,100 --> 00:55:37,734
And I thought, whoever this
guy is, if he ever turns up,

987
00:55:37,734 --> 00:55:40,367
he's got to know
it's a benefit film.

988
00:55:40,367 --> 00:55:44,367
It's helping people, and he's
not going to create a problem.

989
00:55:44,367 --> 00:55:48,100
So I decided to go for it, and
20 years later, I have never

990
00:55:48,100 --> 00:55:52,567
heard anything from he or
his people, and if I ever do,

991
00:55:52,567 --> 00:55:56,433
I'm still hopeful and confident
that everything will be fine.

992
00:55:56,433 --> 00:55:58,333
But that was probably
the biggest risk

993
00:55:58,333 --> 00:56:02,333
that I had to take as
a young filmmaker, just

994
00:56:02,333 --> 00:56:06,133
to protect the quality of what
it was I was trying to create.

995
00:56:13,900 --> 00:56:17,233
In order to do the film
with a very small budget,

996
00:56:17,233 --> 00:56:19,567
we decided half the money
would go towards production

997
00:56:19,567 --> 00:56:22,367
and half the money would
go towards post-production.

998
00:56:22,367 --> 00:56:26,967
But also, as somebody who was
the writer, producer, director,

999
00:56:26,967 --> 00:56:31,233
and financer for the film,
at some point I had to let

1000
00:56:31,233 --> 00:56:32,967
go of some of the control.

1001
00:56:32,967 --> 00:56:36,700
So on the first day of shooting,
I gave my checkbook over to one

1002
00:56:36,700 --> 00:56:40,300
of the line producers,
and he was in charge.

1003
00:56:40,300 --> 00:56:43,066
And after the second or
third day of shooting,

1004
00:56:43,066 --> 00:56:45,133
we sat down to see
how things were going.

1005
00:56:45,133 --> 00:56:47,367
And at that point
I found out that he

1006
00:56:47,367 --> 00:56:52,700
had spent the entire budget, not
just the budget for production,

1007
00:56:52,700 --> 00:56:57,200
but production and
post-production as well.

1008
00:56:57,200 --> 00:56:58,500
So I was a wreck.

1009
00:56:58,500 --> 00:56:59,734
I didn't know what to do.

1010
00:56:59,734 --> 00:57:04,166
And I was completely fried
from just the directing

1011
00:57:04,166 --> 00:57:06,967
responsibilities and couldn't
get to sleep that night,

1012
00:57:06,967 --> 00:57:09,233
and finally decided, OK,
here's what we'll do.

1013
00:57:09,233 --> 00:57:12,066
We'll finish the
shoot and then we'll

1014
00:57:12,066 --> 00:57:17,800
see if we can get donations
of editing bays and everything

1015
00:57:17,800 --> 00:57:20,200
else we needed to create
a rough cut of the film

1016
00:57:20,200 --> 00:57:22,100
that then we could market.

1017
00:57:22,100 --> 00:57:24,767
So that's what we
ended up having to do.

1018
00:57:24,767 --> 00:57:29,900
We got to a good cut
of the film and used

1019
00:57:29,900 --> 00:57:33,567
temporary sound, nothing
that we paid for, et cetera,

1020
00:57:33,567 --> 00:57:37,266
and took it to the one place
that was on the top of my list

1021
00:57:37,266 --> 00:57:40,600
that I thought would want
it, and that was Showtime.

1022
00:57:40,600 --> 00:57:43,100
And Showtime took one
look at the film, who

1023
00:57:43,100 --> 00:57:47,100
was in it, the subject matter,
and they said, yes, absolutely.

1024
00:57:47,100 --> 00:57:48,367
We'll do it.

1025
00:57:48,367 --> 00:57:50,200
So I was really thrilled
that the whole idea

1026
00:57:50,200 --> 00:57:51,867
was coming together,
not just as a film,

1027
00:57:51,867 --> 00:57:53,967
but as a benefit as well.

1028
00:57:53,967 --> 00:57:55,967
And what Showtime
and I worked out

1029
00:57:55,967 --> 00:57:59,100
was that as a part of
their deal with me,

1030
00:57:59,100 --> 00:58:02,533
which was just going to
recoup all of my costs--

1031
00:58:02,533 --> 00:58:04,834
so I wasn't making any
money in the process--

1032
00:58:04,834 --> 00:58:08,100
but they would give
a check for $25,000

1033
00:58:08,100 --> 00:58:10,834
directly to the
Minority AIDS Project.

1034
00:58:10,834 --> 00:58:15,567
So to this day, really proud
that that got pulled off.

1035
00:58:15,567 --> 00:58:18,133
We ended up giving more to
the Minority AIDS Project

1036
00:58:18,133 --> 00:58:21,400
later as more money
came into the film,

1037
00:58:21,400 --> 00:58:24,734
came to me through further
distribution of the film,

1038
00:58:24,734 --> 00:58:27,133
and that was the highlight.

1039
00:58:33,800 --> 00:58:37,300
The low light, so
to speak, regarding

1040
00:58:37,300 --> 00:58:40,967
what happened to the
film, this was right

1041
00:58:40,967 --> 00:58:42,333
before it came out on Showtime.

1042
00:58:42,333 --> 00:58:43,934
Now, it did great on Showtime.

1043
00:58:43,934 --> 00:58:45,066
Got good ratings.

1044
00:58:45,066 --> 00:58:47,333
It was nominated
for Cable Ace Award.

1045
00:58:47,333 --> 00:58:49,867
It won first prize at the
Houston Film Festival.

1046
00:58:49,867 --> 00:58:52,333
So I'm riding high.

1047
00:58:52,333 --> 00:58:54,333
And in the process
of riding high,

1048
00:58:54,333 --> 00:58:56,867
I contacted somebody
who I used to know

1049
00:58:56,867 --> 00:58:58,467
who writes for the LA Times.

1050
00:58:58,467 --> 00:59:00,834
And I said, would you be
interested in doing a feature,

1051
00:59:00,834 --> 00:59:02,433
not just on me as
a young filmmaker,

1052
00:59:02,433 --> 00:59:08,133
but on this benefit process
that we created to do the film?

1053
00:59:08,133 --> 00:59:10,300
Maybe because we
used to be friends,

1054
00:59:10,300 --> 00:59:13,500
he had to be extra
skeptical in his writing.

1055
00:59:13,500 --> 00:59:15,734
So he asked me this question.

1056
00:59:15,734 --> 00:59:20,700
He said, how do you
respond to the criticism

1057
00:59:20,700 --> 00:59:24,633
that making a short film
as a benefit for charity

1058
00:59:24,633 --> 00:59:29,900
is just a big publicity
stunt for your own interest?

1059
00:59:29,900 --> 00:59:32,967
And I thought about that, and
I said kind of off the cuff,

1060
00:59:32,967 --> 00:59:35,567
well, if making a film that
otherwise would have just

1061
00:59:35,567 --> 00:59:39,767
been for me turned out also
to raise money for people

1062
00:59:39,767 --> 00:59:43,834
who really need it, then that is
the greatest publicity stunt I

1063
00:59:43,834 --> 00:59:46,633
ever could have thought of.

1064
00:59:46,633 --> 00:59:49,934
I was a little bit naive to the
way newspaper editing works.

1065
00:59:49,934 --> 00:59:54,533
And the low light was
just around the time

1066
00:59:54,533 --> 00:59:59,033
that the film was premiering,
the article came out,

1067
00:59:59,033 --> 01:00:02,834
and they cut my quote so
that it said something

1068
01:00:02,834 --> 01:00:07,500
like, I figured out the
greatest publicity stunt ever.

1069
01:00:07,500 --> 01:00:10,700
And it sounded like I
was self-aggrandizing and

1070
01:00:10,700 --> 01:00:14,934
opportunistic and it
really was all about me.

1071
01:00:14,934 --> 01:00:17,834
So I was mortified,
but I thought

1072
01:00:17,834 --> 01:00:21,266
the article came out on a
Saturday, it would go away

1073
01:00:21,266 --> 01:00:22,934
and nobody would see it.

1074
01:00:22,934 --> 01:00:25,433
Unfortunately, the
people who saw it

1075
01:00:25,433 --> 01:00:28,800
were the executives at
the Screen Actors Guild.

1076
01:00:28,800 --> 01:00:30,734
Why was this a problem?

1077
01:00:30,734 --> 01:00:34,367
Well, that same line producer
who spent all the money

1078
01:00:34,367 --> 01:00:36,700
by the third day
of production was

1079
01:00:36,700 --> 01:00:39,367
supposed to get
a waiver from SAG

1080
01:00:39,367 --> 01:00:43,467
so that all these top-notch
actors could do the film

1081
01:00:43,467 --> 01:00:45,333
without getting in trouble.

1082
01:00:45,333 --> 01:00:49,200
And I asked him about the waiver
before we started shooting,

1083
01:00:49,200 --> 01:00:51,934
and he said, it's
all taken care of.

1084
01:00:51,934 --> 01:00:55,533
Well, it turns out it
was never taken care of.

1085
01:00:55,533 --> 01:00:58,500
And at this point, especially
because the article

1086
01:00:58,500 --> 01:01:03,533
caused them to distrust
me, SAG basically said,

1087
01:01:03,533 --> 01:01:08,367
either you pay $40,000 for the
salaries of all these actors,

1088
01:01:08,367 --> 01:01:12,467
even though they agreed
to work for free,

1089
01:01:12,467 --> 01:01:15,633
or the film is non-union.

1090
01:01:15,633 --> 01:01:18,734
My first thought
was, OK, non-union.

1091
01:01:18,734 --> 01:01:20,967
Sorry, we made a big
mistake, but I didn't do it

1092
01:01:20,967 --> 01:01:22,367
and I can't fix
it because I don't

1093
01:01:22,367 --> 01:01:24,900
have any money to give anybody.

1094
01:01:24,900 --> 01:01:29,166
But then I found out that
if the film was non-union,

1095
01:01:29,166 --> 01:01:32,467
then the actors would
all be in violation

1096
01:01:32,467 --> 01:01:34,567
of rule one of the
Screen Actors Guild,

1097
01:01:34,567 --> 01:01:38,133
which is that you have to
call and check and make sure

1098
01:01:38,133 --> 01:01:42,934
that a film is kosher
before you do it.

1099
01:01:42,934 --> 01:01:46,667
So I told the actors what
the problem was, and they

1100
01:01:46,667 --> 01:01:48,433
were somewhat sympathetic,
but also really

1101
01:01:48,433 --> 01:01:51,533
irritated and frustrated,
as makes sense.

1102
01:01:51,533 --> 01:01:55,166
Their point of view
was make it go away,

1103
01:01:55,166 --> 01:01:57,300
but I couldn't make it go away.

1104
01:01:57,300 --> 01:02:01,266
And so the true low light of
all of this whole experience

1105
01:02:01,266 --> 01:02:05,834
around Sexual Healing was that
Anthony Edwards, Helen Hunt,

1106
01:02:05,834 --> 01:02:10,200
Jason Alexander, Maggie
Wheeler, and Mare Winningham all

1107
01:02:10,200 --> 01:02:13,467
had to go before
committees of their peers

1108
01:02:13,467 --> 01:02:16,467
and be admonished at
the Screen Actors Guild

1109
01:02:16,467 --> 01:02:18,467
for breaking the rules.

1110
01:02:18,467 --> 01:02:19,900
And it's no wonder
that I haven't

1111
01:02:19,900 --> 01:02:22,734
talked to most of those people
ever since we made the film,

1112
01:02:22,734 --> 01:02:25,467
and to this day, I really
regret that all happened

1113
01:02:25,467 --> 01:02:29,133
and that there wasn't a
way that I could fix it.

1114
01:02:29,133 --> 01:02:31,300
But what made it
even stranger was

1115
01:02:31,300 --> 01:02:36,967
that these people were famous
before we started shooting,

1116
01:02:36,967 --> 01:02:39,500
but got really famous after.

1117
01:02:39,500 --> 01:02:42,500
This was just kind of
luck of timing for me,

1118
01:02:42,500 --> 01:02:44,633
because after we finished
shooting Sexual Healing,

1119
01:02:44,633 --> 01:02:47,800
Seinfeld took off, so
Jason was a huge superstar.

1120
01:02:47,800 --> 01:02:51,533
Mad About You came into being
and Helen was a huge superstar.

1121
01:02:51,533 --> 01:02:57,300
And then ER also premiered and
Anthony Edwards took off, too.

1122
01:02:57,300 --> 01:03:00,400
And that was the
bizarre thing, is

1123
01:03:00,400 --> 01:03:02,633
that these people
had to take days off

1124
01:03:02,633 --> 01:03:07,567
of work from those shows to come
and explain this small, little

1125
01:03:07,567 --> 01:03:10,800
independent short film
and how they had gotten

1126
01:03:10,800 --> 01:03:12,333
embroiled in the controversy.

1127
01:03:19,567 --> 01:03:22,066
What most people don't know
about the movie business

1128
01:03:22,066 --> 01:03:26,367
is that for every person who
takes that leap onto the A

1129
01:03:26,367 --> 01:03:32,433
list, there are 10 or 50 or 100
people who came really close,

1130
01:03:32,433 --> 01:03:34,500
but it just didn't
happen for them.

1131
01:03:34,500 --> 01:03:36,033
And that's the
way it was for me.

1132
01:03:36,033 --> 01:03:38,467
I had made this film.

1133
01:03:38,467 --> 01:03:40,800
As I mentioned, it
did really well,

1134
01:03:40,800 --> 01:03:43,934
and I thought it was going to
create an opportunity for me

1135
01:03:43,934 --> 01:03:45,767
to become a
writer/director and have

1136
01:03:45,767 --> 01:03:47,300
the fabulous
success in Hollywood

1137
01:03:47,300 --> 01:03:50,266
that I always imagined,
dreamed up for myself,

1138
01:03:50,266 --> 01:03:52,700
and it just didn't come to be.

1139
01:03:52,700 --> 01:03:56,100
And I tried and tried and
banged my head against the wall

1140
01:03:56,100 --> 01:03:58,200
and wrote more scripts
like you're supposed to do,

1141
01:03:58,200 --> 01:04:01,066
and I couldn't even get a
job directing a cartoon,

1142
01:04:01,066 --> 01:04:03,300
or writing one for that matter.

1143
01:04:03,300 --> 01:04:06,900
So I was heartbroken and
had to lick my wounds,

1144
01:04:06,900 --> 01:04:11,400
and eventually I moved on
to writing and co-designing

1145
01:04:11,400 --> 01:04:14,867
a graphic adventure game,
and a few other projects,

1146
01:04:14,867 --> 01:04:16,400
up in Silicon Valley,
when they were

1147
01:04:16,400 --> 01:04:18,166
looking for Hollywood talent.

1148
01:04:18,166 --> 01:04:21,300
And then from there, my
life took a number of turns,

1149
01:04:21,300 --> 01:04:24,967
and I ultimately became
a personal growth

1150
01:04:24,967 --> 01:04:27,100
and spiritual
writer and teacher,

1151
01:04:27,100 --> 01:04:30,834
which I am still to this day.

1152
01:04:30,834 --> 01:04:33,300
Sometimes I have
to remind people

1153
01:04:33,300 --> 01:04:36,867
that I'm the same guy who made
this film because I made it

1154
01:04:36,867 --> 01:04:39,000
when I was using Howard
as my first name.

1155
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:41,033
That was my given first name.

1156
01:04:41,033 --> 01:04:44,867
But since then, I switched
to my Hebrew middle

1157
01:04:44,867 --> 01:04:46,066
name, which is Raphael.

1158
01:04:46,066 --> 01:04:47,800
And so I go by
Raphael Cushnir now,

1159
01:04:47,800 --> 01:04:49,867
and that's not what's on
the credits of the film,

1160
01:04:49,867 --> 01:04:53,000
but I promise it's the same guy.

1161
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:57,100
But I have to be honest
and say that I've

1162
01:04:57,100 --> 01:04:58,867
written a couple of
screenplays since then

1163
01:04:58,867 --> 01:05:00,934
and the itch is
still there, and I

1164
01:05:00,934 --> 01:05:02,533
think of getting back
into the business

1165
01:05:02,533 --> 01:05:03,600
at one point or another.

1166
01:05:03,600 --> 01:05:06,000
And every time I call
my friends that I

1167
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:09,300
knew from back then in the
'90s, they all say to me, why?

1168
01:05:09,300 --> 01:05:10,767
Why would you ever
want to do it?

1169
01:05:10,767 --> 01:05:13,667
It's 100 times harder
and 100 times worse

1170
01:05:13,667 --> 01:05:16,533
than it was back then, and
it was pretty hard back then.

1171
01:05:16,533 --> 01:05:20,367
So I'm chastened by
what they have to share,

1172
01:05:20,367 --> 01:05:23,433
but honestly, I think once
you've gotten the taste that I

1173
01:05:23,433 --> 01:05:25,166
did, it never
really does go away,

1174
01:05:25,166 --> 01:05:27,700
and if there's ever a chance
for me to do it again,

1175
01:05:27,700 --> 01:05:29,367
I'll jump at that chance.

1176
01:05:35,433 --> 01:05:39,467
So this is 20 years since I made
this film, even though to me it

1177
01:05:39,467 --> 01:05:41,700
seems just like yesterday.

1178
01:05:41,700 --> 01:05:46,700
And it never came out,
beyond just a few markets,

1179
01:05:46,700 --> 01:05:51,133
to the general public once its
short run on Showtime ended.

1180
01:05:51,133 --> 01:05:53,400
And that's because
of the odd length.

1181
01:05:53,400 --> 01:05:55,133
It's about 41 minutes.

1182
01:05:55,133 --> 01:05:58,367
Also because of the contractual
problems that I mentioned.

1183
01:05:58,367 --> 01:06:02,333
So I'm thrilled that here on the
20th anniversary of the release

1184
01:06:02,333 --> 01:06:05,066
of the film, it's
coming out as a result

1185
01:06:05,066 --> 01:06:08,600
of the new distribution
mechanisms-- video

1186
01:06:08,600 --> 01:06:09,734
streaming, et cetera.

1187
01:06:09,734 --> 01:06:11,467
It's coming out to
the larger public,

1188
01:06:11,467 --> 01:06:13,767
and hopefully a lot more
people will get a chance

1189
01:06:13,767 --> 01:06:16,500
to see it than ever before.

1190
01:06:16,500 --> 01:06:20,333
And also, it just so happens
that 20 years after we

1191
01:06:20,333 --> 01:06:22,100
made Sexual Healing,
Helen Hunt made

1192
01:06:22,100 --> 01:06:25,300
The Sessions, a movie in which
she plays a sex surrogate

1193
01:06:25,300 --> 01:06:27,367
and was nominated
for an Academy Award.

1194
01:06:27,367 --> 01:06:30,133
So it's an odd and
kind of interesting

1195
01:06:30,133 --> 01:06:32,300
book end to a part
of her career.

1196
01:06:32,300 --> 01:06:36,266
She played an innocent
young housewife in 1993

1197
01:06:36,266 --> 01:06:40,300
who was introduced to phone
sex, and then 20 years later she

1198
01:06:40,300 --> 01:06:44,333
plays someone who's more
experienced than just about all

1199
01:06:44,333 --> 01:06:47,934
of us put together in
the realms of sexuality.

1200
01:06:47,934 --> 01:06:51,600
And both of those
films, my modest one

1201
01:06:51,600 --> 01:06:54,233
and then The Sessions,
obviously a big feature

1202
01:06:54,233 --> 01:06:56,433
with a lot of
wonderful nuance to it,

1203
01:06:56,433 --> 01:07:01,100
they both showcase sides
of Helen Hunt's talent that

1204
01:07:01,100 --> 01:07:04,433
aren't often seen in the
other work that she does,

1205
01:07:04,433 --> 01:07:09,333
and that's really
gratifying to be a part of.
