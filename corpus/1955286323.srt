1
00:00:04,024 --> 00:00:07,062
<b>IN THE NAME OF BEN-HUR</b>

2
00:00:07,743 --> 00:00:10,743
<b>Subrip: Pix</b>

3
00:01:14,739 --> 00:01:17,409
This is exactly what's wrong
with the towns of this province.

4
00:01:18,677 --> 00:01:20,346
No hospitality.

5
00:01:28,453 --> 00:01:30,656
If you aren't allowed to...

6
00:01:31,724 --> 00:01:34,594
sample the goods,

7
00:01:34,626 --> 00:01:37,830
how do you know if
you want to buy 'em?

8
00:01:41,266 --> 00:01:42,768
We don't mean any harm.

9
00:01:42,801 --> 00:01:45,504
We're here to protect you.

10
00:01:45,537 --> 00:01:47,372
That's why
we've been sent here.

11
00:01:47,406 --> 00:01:49,675
Now, the fact
that you ran from us

12
00:01:49,707 --> 00:01:54,179
must mean you've
got something to hide.

13
00:01:56,649 --> 00:01:58,284
Are you hiding something?

14
00:02:00,686 --> 00:02:03,156
Maybe we need
to search you.

15
00:02:05,456 --> 00:02:08,760
Why don't you
bastard Romans go home?

16
00:02:08,794 --> 00:02:12,498
It's because of people like
you we have to be here,

17
00:02:12,531 --> 00:02:17,170
people who fail to respect
the authority of Rome.

18
00:02:17,203 --> 00:02:21,741
May your children
be eaten by better boars.

19
00:02:26,679 --> 00:02:28,548
Romans!

20
00:02:37,656 --> 00:02:38,790
You her boyfriend?

21
00:02:38,824 --> 00:02:41,594
You look more like
her sister to me.

22
00:02:51,336 --> 00:02:54,774
See? I told you this town
would be interesting.

23
00:03:19,264 --> 00:03:21,533
Maybe you should tell him
you like being with us.

24
00:03:21,567 --> 00:03:24,504
He should mind
his own business.

25
00:03:27,939 --> 00:03:30,475
That's not
very sporting.

26
00:03:46,592 --> 00:03:50,663
Maybe you should consider
another way, my friend.

27
00:03:56,502 --> 00:03:57,804
You should leave.

28
00:05:00,966 --> 00:05:02,968
Word of advice.

29
00:05:03,999 --> 00:05:05,637
One cannot always count
on divine providence

30
00:05:05,670 --> 00:05:07,572
in matters
such as these.

31
00:05:07,605 --> 00:05:12,478
It is best not to start
a fight you cannot win.

32
00:05:12,511 --> 00:05:14,046
Who said
I wasn't gonna win?

33
00:05:14,079 --> 00:05:16,781
In my experience, the man
lying bleeding on the ground

34
00:05:16,814 --> 00:05:20,786
weaponless and surrounded by
soldiers is rarely the victor.

35
00:05:20,819 --> 00:05:21,920
But not you?

36
00:05:23,154 --> 00:05:26,058
No, not today.

37
00:05:46,411 --> 00:05:47,779
Who are you?

38
00:05:47,812 --> 00:05:49,080
It is of no matter.

39
00:05:49,113 --> 00:05:51,750
You a soldier, former
gladiator perhaps?

40
00:05:53,451 --> 00:05:55,420
Would you train me

41
00:05:55,454 --> 00:05:58,790
to do what you
just did, to fight?

42
00:05:58,824 --> 00:06:01,060
If you wish
to truly live in peace,

43
00:06:01,093 --> 00:06:02,795
you must forgive
your tormentors.

44
00:06:02,827 --> 00:06:05,497
Forgiving the Romans is
something I can never do.

45
00:06:05,531 --> 00:06:07,966
Lusitania may be
far from Rome,

46
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,670
but we still live under Roman
law, and Romans are everywhere.

47
00:06:11,702 --> 00:06:15,473
If you cannot accept that,
prepare for a life of pain.

48
00:06:15,507 --> 00:06:16,942
I cannot help you.

49
00:06:33,492 --> 00:06:36,862
Get to the meat
of it, Kaeso.

50
00:06:36,894 --> 00:06:38,630
It was a disagreement.

51
00:06:38,663 --> 00:06:42,168
Well, I would hope this was not
the result of an agreement.

52
00:06:42,201 --> 00:06:45,905
It was a simple fight
in a tavern, sir,

53
00:06:45,937 --> 00:06:48,740
men letting off steam.

54
00:06:48,774 --> 00:06:51,810
May I ask the cause
of said disagreement?

55
00:06:51,843 --> 00:06:54,846
It's not worthy
of your time, sir.

56
00:07:03,254 --> 00:07:08,093
It was a woman, sir,
a question of honor.

57
00:07:08,125 --> 00:07:11,930
I heard no report
of a disturbance.

58
00:07:11,963 --> 00:07:15,867
This watering hole is
rather off-site, sir.

59
00:07:15,901 --> 00:07:17,203
We shouldn't
have frequented...

60
00:07:17,235 --> 00:07:18,737
No, you shouldn't!

61
00:07:22,975 --> 00:07:26,145
We gave more
than we got, sir.

62
00:07:26,177 --> 00:07:28,547
I can assure you.

63
00:07:28,579 --> 00:07:31,850
The odds were
not in our favor,

64
00:07:31,884 --> 00:07:33,819
yet we prevailed.

65
00:07:33,851 --> 00:07:35,887
Well, I would hope so.

66
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:39,692
We wouldn't want the locals to
think our men weak, now, would we?

67
00:07:39,725 --> 00:07:41,126
No, sir.

68
00:07:41,158 --> 00:07:43,862
They will not have been
left with that impression,

69
00:07:43,896 --> 00:07:45,898
I can assure you.

70
00:07:45,930 --> 00:07:46,966
Dismissed.

71
00:07:52,670 --> 00:07:55,940
Can I find fault in Rome
for the quality of soldier

72
00:07:55,973 --> 00:07:57,675
assigned our garrison?

73
00:07:57,709 --> 00:08:02,180
Does not the medicine
match the disease?

74
00:08:02,213 --> 00:08:04,516
This may be so.

75
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:07,119
We are far from Rome.
Our borders are thin.

76
00:08:07,151 --> 00:08:09,053
Yet is it
not an oversight

77
00:08:09,086 --> 00:08:11,022
leaving the edges
of empire

78
00:08:11,055 --> 00:08:13,725
to a fighting force so
weak and undisciplined?

79
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:16,829
Now, a man
with less experience

80
00:08:16,862 --> 00:08:20,833
would say apply more discipline,
more rigorous training,

81
00:08:20,865 --> 00:08:22,967
but I tell you this
tactic will not work.

82
00:08:23,999 --> 00:08:27,805
Rome needs to send us a
higher quality of soldier.

83
00:08:27,838 --> 00:08:31,610
I have requested that at your
insistence several times, sir.

84
00:08:31,642 --> 00:08:32,845
I know.

85
00:08:32,878 --> 00:08:35,548
The silence from Rome
speaks loudly.

86
00:08:35,581 --> 00:08:38,317
Nero busies himself.

87
00:08:38,350 --> 00:08:41,521
With his concubines,
his games, and his orgies.

88
00:08:44,121 --> 00:08:46,091
Maybe a gift
would be in order,

89
00:08:46,124 --> 00:08:47,860
a tribute
from our province

90
00:08:47,893 --> 00:08:49,327
that would remind
Rome of our value.

91
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:50,828
What do we have here

92
00:08:50,861 --> 00:08:52,964
that they do not
already possess in Rome?

93
00:08:54,832 --> 00:08:56,067
We have cork.

94
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:57,937
We are near to the sea

95
00:08:57,970 --> 00:08:59,204
and possess
a bounty of foodstuff

96
00:08:59,236 --> 00:09:00,706
that Rome
could only dream of.

97
00:09:00,739 --> 00:09:03,208
We are
talking about Nero.

98
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:08,980
This Kaeso and this fight over
a woman's given me an idea.

99
00:09:09,014 --> 00:09:13,318
We send women?

100
00:09:13,351 --> 00:09:16,154
Fresh concubines for Nero.

101
00:09:16,187 --> 00:09:18,189
Well, if we make inquiries,

102
00:09:18,222 --> 00:09:22,193
I'm sure we can find some among
the locals that'll please him,

103
00:09:22,226 --> 00:09:23,928
untouched, unspoiled.

104
00:09:23,961 --> 00:09:28,033
Would this not cause a
disturbance amongst the locals?

105
00:09:28,066 --> 00:09:30,336
If we take
from the lower ranks,

106
00:09:30,369 --> 00:09:34,273
pay them well enough,
it'll lessen the disturbance.

107
00:09:34,306 --> 00:09:36,240
I see.

108
00:09:36,274 --> 00:09:38,243
If our gift
finds favor with Nero,

109
00:09:38,275 --> 00:09:42,014
he will be more open to sending
us a higher caliber of soldier.

110
00:09:51,389 --> 00:09:53,759
How on earth can you show up

111
00:09:53,792 --> 00:09:56,829
at such a fine establishment
looking as such, Adrian?

112
00:09:56,861 --> 00:09:58,363
Well, at least
I have an excuse.

113
00:09:58,397 --> 00:10:00,099
What's yours, Caius?

114
00:10:00,131 --> 00:10:01,733
Been sleeping with
your sheep again?

115
00:10:01,767 --> 00:10:03,736
Well, at least I have
an occupation, Adrian.

116
00:10:03,769 --> 00:10:06,739
No, no. My ambitions are
higher than mere survival.

117
00:10:06,772 --> 00:10:09,074
From the looks of it, survival
should be your guide.

118
00:10:09,106 --> 00:10:10,908
It was probably
his sister Lucia.

119
00:10:10,942 --> 00:10:12,244
No, no, no, no.

120
00:10:12,277 --> 00:10:13,879
Believe me, if it was her,

121
00:10:13,912 --> 00:10:16,815
these wounds would be
much, much worse.

122
00:10:18,015 --> 00:10:19,017
Yes.

123
00:10:19,051 --> 00:10:20,252
You've had too many.

124
00:10:38,937 --> 00:10:41,240
I think you'll find
what you're looking for

125
00:10:41,273 --> 00:10:43,307
at the village
down by the river.

126
00:10:43,341 --> 00:10:45,844
They're straight
from the Azores,

127
00:10:45,876 --> 00:10:49,747
refugees, and you can have
your pick of the lot.

128
00:10:49,780 --> 00:10:53,751
Now, is it something you
want us to take care of,

129
00:10:53,784 --> 00:10:55,754
or will your boys
be doing it?

130
00:10:55,787 --> 00:10:59,692
There will be coin in it
if you can be discreet.

131
00:10:59,725 --> 00:11:00,959
Well, they
don't come to me

132
00:11:00,991 --> 00:11:02,727
looking for a big show,
now, do they?

133
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:07,198
For expenses to start.
The rest on delivery.

134
00:11:07,231 --> 00:11:09,767
These women are destined to be
concubines for the Emperor Nero.

135
00:11:09,801 --> 00:11:11,137
It will be so.

136
00:11:21,947 --> 00:11:23,315
There is
trouble ahead.

137
00:11:23,347 --> 00:11:24,882
Well, what is it?

138
00:11:24,916 --> 00:11:26,852
Sergius and the Romans
are plotting something,

139
00:11:26,884 --> 00:11:28,319
and we need
to stop it.

140
00:11:28,352 --> 00:11:29,320
Go on.

141
00:11:29,354 --> 00:11:30,855
The other day,

142
00:11:30,889 --> 00:11:32,356
I met a sort
of sell-sword.

143
00:11:32,389 --> 00:11:34,425
No, we can deal with this
ourselves, Adrian.

144
00:11:34,458 --> 00:11:35,993
No. He's no
ordinary mercenary,

145
00:11:36,027 --> 00:11:38,297
but I may need a bit of
coin from each of you.

146
00:11:58,850 --> 00:12:00,052
Where are you?

147
00:12:10,995 --> 00:12:13,131
Excuse me.
May I help you?

148
00:12:13,164 --> 00:12:15,433
I've no money
to pay you.

149
00:12:15,466 --> 00:12:17,369
Do not seek payment,

150
00:12:17,402 --> 00:12:19,838
only to pass the time
in conversation.

151
00:12:19,870 --> 00:12:21,005
Well, go on then.

152
00:12:21,038 --> 00:12:22,073
I'm looking for someone.

153
00:12:22,106 --> 00:12:23,207
He's not too young,

154
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:24,976
but not as old as yourself.

155
00:12:25,009 --> 00:12:26,778
He's 17 stone
and carries a staff,

156
00:12:26,812 --> 00:12:28,180
although I don't think
he needs it.

157
00:12:28,212 --> 00:12:31,916
Could be,
but folks live out here

158
00:12:31,950 --> 00:12:33,951
because they don't want
interference with outsiders.

159
00:12:33,985 --> 00:12:37,822
I only wish to tell him thanks
and to offer him a job.

160
00:12:37,855 --> 00:12:40,158
Well, you may find him
up that way.

161
00:12:40,192 --> 00:12:41,494
Thank you.

162
00:12:53,904 --> 00:12:56,875
You might think it a coincidence
that we meet on this trail,

163
00:12:56,908 --> 00:12:59,076
but I can
confirm it is not.

164
00:12:59,110 --> 00:13:03,115
So you left the town and
made for safer climes.

165
00:13:03,148 --> 00:13:04,582
I wish.

166
00:13:04,615 --> 00:13:07,385
I told you before
that I will not train you.

167
00:13:07,418 --> 00:13:09,221
That path will
only lead to pain.

168
00:13:09,254 --> 00:13:10,822
I wish to offer you
a job.

169
00:13:10,855 --> 00:13:12,924
I respectfully decline.

170
00:13:12,957 --> 00:13:13,925
You haven't heard
the offer yet.

171
00:13:16,461 --> 00:13:18,163
From my experience,

172
00:13:18,196 --> 00:13:21,066
when a man of no apparent
means offers a job,

173
00:13:21,099 --> 00:13:23,134
it is one rarely
worthy of consideration.

174
00:13:23,168 --> 00:13:24,537
Hear me out.

175
00:13:27,605 --> 00:13:30,241
The Romans are planning to capture
slaves for Nero's concubines.

176
00:13:30,274 --> 00:13:33,044
These people are not choosing
this upon their own free will,

177
00:13:33,077 --> 00:13:35,447
nor were they
born into slavery.

178
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:36,882
They're being stolen,

179
00:13:36,914 --> 00:13:39,250
and that,
I cannot abide.

180
00:13:39,283 --> 00:13:42,254
Will you join me in my efforts
to stop this offense?

181
00:13:42,287 --> 00:13:45,858
If one were to intercede in every
injustice that occurred in the world,

182
00:13:45,890 --> 00:13:48,059
one would toil
from dusk until dawn.

183
00:13:48,092 --> 00:13:51,029
It would turn one's heart as
black as the coal from a fire.

184
00:13:52,364 --> 00:13:54,399
Better to tend
to your own affairs.

185
00:13:54,432 --> 00:13:56,401
Do you not care about the
plight of the innocent?

186
00:14:01,139 --> 00:14:05,076
I am curious as to what your
plan would be to stop this raid.

187
00:14:05,110 --> 00:14:06,378
Would not only be me...

188
00:14:06,410 --> 00:14:08,946
but with a cadre of
those who feel as I do,

189
00:14:08,980 --> 00:14:10,282
who stand
for the people.

190
00:14:10,315 --> 00:14:13,018
And who will soon
all shortly be crucified

191
00:14:13,051 --> 00:14:15,086
by the Romans
on the outskirts of town.

192
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:18,523
If you feel as such, why did
you help me the other day?

193
00:14:18,556 --> 00:14:21,026
I did not do it for you.

194
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:24,062
Now be on your way.

195
00:14:26,464 --> 00:14:29,501
And consider again choosing
the path of forgiveness.

196
00:14:39,443 --> 00:14:41,145
Almighty Lord...

197
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:45,150
I know I have
not always followed

198
00:14:45,182 --> 00:14:47,451
the path of righteousness.

199
00:14:47,485 --> 00:14:49,020
I have sinned.

200
00:14:50,488 --> 00:14:53,659
But you have always shown
me the way.

201
00:14:53,692 --> 00:14:57,196
Now I ask for your guidance
once again.

202
00:15:00,365 --> 00:15:02,967
Since I finished
my work at Calixto,

203
00:15:03,999 --> 00:15:06,538
I have been listening for signs
as to what to do.

204
00:16:37,528 --> 00:16:38,764
What is your name?

205
00:16:38,797 --> 00:16:40,298
Melina.

206
00:16:51,442 --> 00:16:54,178
Load 'em up.

207
00:16:54,211 --> 00:16:56,247
Right. Open the cart.

208
00:17:19,471 --> 00:17:22,173
That's it.
That's enough.

209
00:17:22,207 --> 00:17:23,708
It's a fair week's
ride to Rome.

210
00:17:23,740 --> 00:17:27,546
We won't have enough rations
for any more.

211
00:17:27,578 --> 00:17:29,248
So that's your lot then.

212
00:18:27,739 --> 00:18:29,240
Quick! Split up!

213
00:18:41,885 --> 00:18:43,788
Well, that went
rather well.

214
00:18:43,820 --> 00:18:48,726
I feel your gift will be
rather well received, sir.

215
00:18:48,759 --> 00:18:51,229
I have a question
for you, Cyprian.

216
00:18:51,261 --> 00:18:56,801
How come those young men who tried
to interfere knew of our operation?

217
00:18:58,403 --> 00:19:00,704
I just suspected they were
from the refugee camp.

218
00:19:00,738 --> 00:19:01,873
Were they?

219
00:19:01,905 --> 00:19:03,908
I got
the distinct impression

220
00:19:03,942 --> 00:19:06,612
they were trying to
sabotage our operation.

221
00:19:08,546 --> 00:19:11,249
These people are merely trying
to protect their loved ones.

222
00:19:11,281 --> 00:19:13,617
Because if
there were some kind

223
00:19:13,651 --> 00:19:16,254
of organized rebellion
in this area,

224
00:19:16,287 --> 00:19:17,389
I'd want
to know about it.

225
00:19:17,422 --> 00:19:18,856
I find that
highly unlikely, sir,

226
00:19:18,890 --> 00:19:20,926
but I will keep an ear
to the ground.

227
00:19:20,959 --> 00:19:22,861
You do that.

228
00:19:42,713 --> 00:19:45,317
Hey, hey!

229
00:19:45,349 --> 00:19:46,317
The Romans,

230
00:19:46,351 --> 00:19:47,719
-they took...
-I know.

231
00:19:47,751 --> 00:19:48,720
I've been to the camp.

232
00:19:48,752 --> 00:19:50,989
I want to go with you.

233
00:19:51,021 --> 00:19:52,957
If you're willing to die,
then get in.

234
00:19:59,596 --> 00:20:02,533
Hey! Hey!

235
00:20:02,567 --> 00:20:04,336
What weapons
do you have?

236
00:20:04,368 --> 00:20:05,603
I have my knife.

237
00:20:05,636 --> 00:20:06,837
Keep it as last resort.

238
00:20:06,871 --> 00:20:08,707
If they capture you,
you can kill yourself.

239
00:20:08,740 --> 00:20:09,841
What?

240
00:20:09,874 --> 00:20:11,675
Can't afford
to kill the Romans.

241
00:20:11,709 --> 00:20:13,711
Have you seen what
they've been doing?!

242
00:20:13,744 --> 00:20:16,947
You kill one, and you have the
entire legion hunting you down.

243
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:19,651
Wound them, take their
honor, then you might live.

244
00:20:32,864 --> 00:20:34,298
Stop the cart.

245
00:20:41,739 --> 00:20:44,409
Stay with me on this one.
Hold the chariot.

246
00:20:47,912 --> 00:20:49,280
You're insane.

247
00:20:49,314 --> 00:20:50,515
Never claimed otherwise.

248
00:21:47,805 --> 00:21:49,740
So that's
your sell-sword.

249
00:21:49,773 --> 00:21:53,444
He's worth far more
than we could pay him.

250
00:21:54,644 --> 00:21:56,514
Yah!

251
00:22:04,955 --> 00:22:07,024
It's all clear.

252
00:22:18,869 --> 00:22:19,936
Come on.

253
00:22:23,807 --> 00:22:24,843
Okay?

254
00:22:24,875 --> 00:22:26,877
All right.
Go on.

255
00:22:26,911 --> 00:22:29,013
This place isn't safe
for you anymore.

256
00:22:29,046 --> 00:22:30,048
Do you have
anywhere else to go?

257
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:32,149
Yes.

258
00:22:32,182 --> 00:22:33,884
Pack up your things
and leave

259
00:22:33,917 --> 00:22:35,553
before the Romans
return.

260
00:22:38,855 --> 00:22:42,861
All of you should leave
this place soon.

261
00:22:42,894 --> 00:22:45,396
The Romans will be
coming after us.

262
00:22:45,430 --> 00:22:46,698
It's just
a matter of time.

263
00:22:46,730 --> 00:22:47,832
And where would we go?

264
00:22:47,865 --> 00:22:49,067
This is our home.

265
00:22:49,099 --> 00:22:51,068
I was born on this land.

266
00:22:51,102 --> 00:22:53,805
We are from here,
and they are not.

267
00:22:53,837 --> 00:22:55,072
We shall not leave.

268
00:22:55,105 --> 00:22:57,174
It would be better
to stop fighting.

269
00:22:57,208 --> 00:22:58,977
As sure
as the sun rises,

270
00:22:59,009 --> 00:23:01,479
you will die if you
continue this fight.

271
00:23:01,511 --> 00:23:04,515
That may be, but I will
still get my revenge.

272
00:23:04,548 --> 00:23:08,420
You have spirit, but you are
no match for Roman soldiers.

273
00:23:08,452 --> 00:23:12,723
They will send out a force to
seek revenge for this incident.

274
00:23:12,757 --> 00:23:14,692
Believe me,
they will get it.

275
00:23:15,859 --> 00:23:17,928
I don't care if I die.

276
00:23:17,961 --> 00:23:20,498
I will never stop fighting.

277
00:23:20,530 --> 00:23:22,500
-Adrian...
-I'm leaving.

278
00:23:24,201 --> 00:23:26,738
The warmer humors
rule him.

279
00:23:26,770 --> 00:23:29,840
It has always been so.

280
00:23:29,874 --> 00:23:32,110
Yet we owe him so much.

281
00:23:33,778 --> 00:23:36,480
We are all free men,
but in status,

282
00:23:36,513 --> 00:23:39,216
we are but a little higher
than a slave.

283
00:23:39,250 --> 00:23:42,086
Adrian gathered us together.

284
00:23:42,118 --> 00:23:44,555
He inspired us with an idea

285
00:23:44,588 --> 00:23:47,558
that one day the Romans
would no longer rule.

286
00:23:47,592 --> 00:23:51,663
And that's something coming from
someone who overcame so much.

287
00:23:51,695 --> 00:23:53,464
What do you mean?

288
00:23:53,498 --> 00:23:56,100
Adrian's an orphan.

289
00:23:56,133 --> 00:23:58,537
His father died
when he was young.

290
00:23:59,871 --> 00:24:02,674
He was brought up
by only his mother.

291
00:24:02,707 --> 00:24:05,710
She had Adrian
and a little girl, Lucia.

292
00:24:07,278 --> 00:24:09,747
Then, one day, when the
Romans came to the village,

293
00:24:09,779 --> 00:24:12,884
they wanted to claim
his mother as their prize.

294
00:24:12,916 --> 00:24:15,853
When she refused,

295
00:24:15,886 --> 00:24:17,621
they got mad

296
00:24:17,654 --> 00:24:19,857
and beat her
to the point of death.

297
00:24:21,625 --> 00:24:24,796
Adrian was just a boy.

298
00:24:24,828 --> 00:24:28,665
Since then, he has brought up
his sister all alone.

299
00:24:28,699 --> 00:24:30,935
That's why Adrian
hates the Romans

300
00:24:30,968 --> 00:24:34,206
and anyone who takes
advantage of the people.

301
00:24:35,972 --> 00:24:37,541
Where does Adrian live?

302
00:24:53,290 --> 00:24:54,925
Leave her alone!

303
00:24:54,959 --> 00:24:56,693
She's got nothing
to do with this!

304
00:24:56,727 --> 00:24:58,930
Maybe so.

305
00:24:58,962 --> 00:25:01,164
Let her go, and I'll
come with you willingly.

306
00:25:01,198 --> 00:25:03,902
You're
coming with us.

307
00:25:03,934 --> 00:25:06,637
So is she.

308
00:25:06,671 --> 00:25:08,673
She'll be heading
for Nero's palace...

309
00:25:09,941 --> 00:25:11,543
thanks to you.

310
00:25:25,323 --> 00:25:27,792
Legionnaire!

311
00:25:28,858 --> 00:25:30,861
You are a disgrace!

312
00:25:30,894 --> 00:25:33,097
Lower your sword, and
return to your barracks.

313
00:25:34,332 --> 00:25:35,867
Return to our barracks?

314
00:25:35,900 --> 00:25:38,737
Right.

315
00:25:51,848 --> 00:25:53,884
I spent three years
in the galleys

316
00:25:53,917 --> 00:25:55,986
and six more
in the arena.

317
00:25:56,019 --> 00:25:59,590
I have killed men in ways
you couldn't imagine.

318
00:25:59,624 --> 00:26:01,593
Now, if you do not lower
your sword and leave,

319
00:26:01,625 --> 00:26:02,826
I will maim you,

320
00:26:02,859 --> 00:26:04,861
and then I will
hunt down your family

321
00:26:04,894 --> 00:26:06,230
and kill them
while they sleep.

322
00:26:06,262 --> 00:26:08,265
When I have done that,

323
00:26:08,298 --> 00:26:11,134
I will come back
and finish your life.

324
00:26:11,167 --> 00:26:12,937
So choose your next
move carefully.

325
00:26:20,644 --> 00:26:21,645
Who are you?

326
00:26:22,980 --> 00:26:26,284
To you, I am no one.

327
00:26:26,317 --> 00:26:29,053
It is best you forget
all you know of me

328
00:26:29,086 --> 00:26:31,355
and forget about
this place after today.

329
00:26:56,079 --> 00:26:58,249
I had the matter in hand.

330
00:26:58,281 --> 00:26:59,983
So I could see.

331
00:27:00,017 --> 00:27:01,753
Thank you.

332
00:27:05,722 --> 00:27:08,725
You may have noticed my brother
is as modest as he is wise.

333
00:27:08,759 --> 00:27:11,229
He does have a certain
boldness about him.

334
00:27:13,029 --> 00:27:15,432
My name is Lucia Bardilo.

335
00:27:15,465 --> 00:27:18,035
I am Judah Ben-Hur.

336
00:27:18,068 --> 00:27:21,972
Are you the Ben-Hur who built
the Calixto catacombs of Rome?

337
00:27:22,006 --> 00:27:24,242
Our mother spoke
of visiting there.

338
00:27:25,843 --> 00:27:28,013
You are Judah Ben-Hur?

339
00:27:29,747 --> 00:27:33,118
How did this happen,
your arrival in Lusitania?

340
00:27:34,417 --> 00:27:37,655
By luck and
divine providence.

341
00:27:38,888 --> 00:27:40,791
Before my wealth
was extinguished,

342
00:27:40,825 --> 00:27:42,427
we were able to
complete the catacombs.

343
00:27:42,460 --> 00:27:44,327
For that,
I am grateful.

344
00:27:44,361 --> 00:27:47,365
But then, a great plague of
typhus spread from the Tiber.

345
00:27:48,499 --> 00:27:51,435
It claimed many,

346
00:27:51,469 --> 00:27:54,806
my wife and children
among them.

347
00:27:54,838 --> 00:27:57,174
When I had
laid them to rest,

348
00:27:57,208 --> 00:28:00,411
I took my horses and traveled
the roads of the Empire,

349
00:28:00,443 --> 00:28:02,480
eventually
ending up here.

350
00:28:02,512 --> 00:28:04,281
No one to trouble me,

351
00:28:04,315 --> 00:28:05,950
I thought I'd end my days
in peace and solitude here.

352
00:28:07,484 --> 00:28:08,985
Then I'm sorry
for dragging you

353
00:28:09,019 --> 00:28:10,188
into all of this.

354
00:28:10,221 --> 00:28:13,191
It was my decision
to become involved.

355
00:28:14,991 --> 00:28:17,761
I don't know
what to say.

356
00:28:17,795 --> 00:28:19,931
Thank you.

357
00:28:19,963 --> 00:28:21,331
Do not thank me.

358
00:28:21,365 --> 00:28:23,000
Thank
your friend Caius.

359
00:28:23,032 --> 00:28:26,103
He's the one that told
me where you lived.

360
00:28:26,136 --> 00:28:28,306
I did not come here to
rescue you from Romans.

361
00:28:29,773 --> 00:28:31,208
I have reconsidered
your offer

362
00:28:31,241 --> 00:28:32,876
to train you
and your brothers,

363
00:28:32,910 --> 00:28:35,113
but there
are conditions.

364
00:28:35,145 --> 00:28:36,913
Of course.

365
00:28:36,946 --> 00:28:39,382
Are you willing to do
anything to stop the Romans?

366
00:28:39,415 --> 00:28:40,484
Yes.

367
00:28:41,852 --> 00:28:42,821
To die?

368
00:28:44,121 --> 00:28:46,091
Yes.

369
00:28:47,458 --> 00:28:50,161
Then I will
train you both.

370
00:28:50,193 --> 00:28:53,030
For once we start down this
road, there is no coming back.

371
00:28:54,298 --> 00:28:57,868
So you both must be
self-sufficient.

372
00:28:57,902 --> 00:29:00,838
If you agree to that,
then we can continue.

373
00:29:05,241 --> 00:29:08,312
Go and pack your things.

374
00:29:17,488 --> 00:29:22,559
I read how Caesar was repelled from
Britannia by warriors on chariots.

375
00:29:22,593 --> 00:29:26,297
Yes, a lost art.

376
00:29:26,329 --> 00:29:28,265
Chariots are still
common in the arena,

377
00:29:28,298 --> 00:29:32,502
but on the battlefield,
cavalry is now king.

378
00:29:32,536 --> 00:29:34,238
I read how
the warriors,

379
00:29:34,270 --> 00:29:36,240
they rode their
chariots two up,

380
00:29:36,272 --> 00:29:39,242
one the driver, the other
free to bear arms,

381
00:29:39,276 --> 00:29:42,079
even leaping from the
chariot to attack on foot

382
00:29:42,112 --> 00:29:45,082
and then running back
to the safety of the chariot

383
00:29:45,115 --> 00:29:46,817
before his offender
could attack.

384
00:29:46,851 --> 00:29:48,553
She reads a lot.

385
00:29:49,987 --> 00:29:52,290
Could you teach me
to ride the chariot?

386
00:29:52,323 --> 00:29:53,891
I can ride a horse.

387
00:29:53,923 --> 00:29:57,360
Before our mother passed,
we had many horses.

388
00:29:57,394 --> 00:29:59,063
She's a good rider.

389
00:29:59,096 --> 00:30:01,298
I can use a bow
and a sling, too.

390
00:30:01,332 --> 00:30:06,070
Yep. Many a grouse and squirrel
have fallen from her arrows.

391
00:30:07,605 --> 00:30:10,508
There is a difference between
using your bow to hunt

392
00:30:10,540 --> 00:30:13,410
and using it
in combat.

393
00:30:13,443 --> 00:30:16,614
Do you think you could raise
your bow against another person?

394
00:30:16,646 --> 00:30:19,817
If it were a Roman, gladly.

395
00:30:25,288 --> 00:30:28,225
Today, you will find you have
the same resources available

396
00:30:28,259 --> 00:30:31,562
as any combatant
you will encounter.

397
00:30:31,595 --> 00:30:34,999
You have two arms,
two legs

398
00:30:35,031 --> 00:30:37,500
and a head
to control them.

399
00:30:37,534 --> 00:30:42,440
If you are successful, you
will retain those attributes,

400
00:30:42,472 --> 00:30:47,377
although your opponents will dearly
like to deprive you of them.

401
00:30:47,411 --> 00:30:49,881
Adrian, step forward.

402
00:30:54,984 --> 00:30:56,920
Engage me.

403
00:30:59,990 --> 00:31:05,061
Your objective is not to
react to your opponent.

404
00:31:05,095 --> 00:31:10,168
Your goal is to
anticipate the move.

405
00:31:23,012 --> 00:31:25,081
Good.

406
00:31:25,115 --> 00:31:28,286
If you are using a sword
or other bladed weapon,

407
00:31:28,318 --> 00:31:31,021
there are a finite number
of motions you can use

408
00:31:31,055 --> 00:31:32,189
to propagate
an attack.

409
00:31:32,221 --> 00:31:35,393
By studying the birth
of the attack,

410
00:31:35,425 --> 00:31:36,426
you can counter it.

411
00:31:38,061 --> 00:31:39,663
Attack me.

412
00:31:49,472 --> 00:31:52,309
If you can observe
your opponent,

413
00:31:52,343 --> 00:31:56,514
you can anticipate their
move and counterstrike.

414
00:32:09,159 --> 00:32:13,230
Observe, anticipate,
counterstrike.

415
00:32:13,262 --> 00:32:16,299
Otherwise, you will be
on the defensive.

416
00:32:16,333 --> 00:32:19,003
Any counterattack
will be off balance.

417
00:32:22,172 --> 00:32:25,076
You will learn the feints
for every weapon,

418
00:32:25,108 --> 00:32:29,045
how to counter each one.

419
00:32:29,078 --> 00:32:32,215
Now, everybody pair up.

420
00:32:38,154 --> 00:32:42,026
We start with
a straight thrust.

421
00:32:46,130 --> 00:32:48,733
Are you telling me
that you were unable

422
00:32:48,766 --> 00:32:51,302
to find those responsible
for this incident?

423
00:32:51,335 --> 00:32:53,004
Aye.

424
00:32:53,037 --> 00:32:55,239
That is correct, sir.

425
00:32:55,271 --> 00:32:59,576
And what do you believe
their motivations were?

426
00:33:01,211 --> 00:33:02,547
I cannot say.

427
00:33:04,114 --> 00:33:06,317
Cyprian, you have
an ear to the ground here.

428
00:33:06,349 --> 00:33:09,052
Is this
an isolated incident,

429
00:33:09,086 --> 00:33:12,123
or is it a symptom
of some larger rebellion?

430
00:33:13,390 --> 00:33:15,626
There is
some civil unrest.

431
00:33:15,659 --> 00:33:18,195
I wouldn't
call it organized.

432
00:33:18,228 --> 00:33:19,430
It may have
been personal.

433
00:33:19,462 --> 00:33:21,031
Personal?

434
00:33:21,065 --> 00:33:23,701
You mean this is a direct
affront to my authority?

435
00:33:23,733 --> 00:33:24,918
I think they...

436
00:33:24,919 --> 00:33:26,102
Shut up.

437
00:33:26,135 --> 00:33:27,471
You are confined to barracks
till further notice.

438
00:33:39,148 --> 00:33:41,684
I didn't mean
you personally, sir.

439
00:33:41,718 --> 00:33:43,287
I meant the ones
who did this

440
00:33:43,319 --> 00:33:44,788
didn't like their people
taken for concubines.

441
00:33:46,423 --> 00:33:50,428
Incidents of this nature
cannot be tolerated.

442
00:33:50,461 --> 00:33:52,797
Once word gets out that
Roman law can be defied,

443
00:33:52,829 --> 00:33:54,432
it opens the doors
to sedition.

444
00:33:54,464 --> 00:33:58,234
We must be swift and merciless
with our reprisals.

445
00:33:58,268 --> 00:33:59,569
I agree.

446
00:33:59,603 --> 00:34:01,806
The true measure will be

447
00:34:01,838 --> 00:34:04,307
how we use this affront
to our advantage.

448
00:34:04,340 --> 00:34:09,480
The men we have we know are useless
in this kind of situation.

449
00:34:09,512 --> 00:34:13,483
Cyprian, what does one do
when the knife is dull?

450
00:34:14,550 --> 00:34:15,619
Sharpen it.

451
00:34:15,652 --> 00:34:18,621
Yes, but if the steel
is not true,

452
00:34:18,655 --> 00:34:21,325
it'll soon
turn dull again.

453
00:34:21,358 --> 00:34:24,260
We need new knives
honed of tempered steel.

454
00:34:24,293 --> 00:34:28,431
And where would one find such
knives, as it were, sir?

455
00:34:28,465 --> 00:34:30,768
With the wars
winding down in Carthage,

456
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:35,271
a great many experienced sell-swords
can be found seeking work.

457
00:34:35,304 --> 00:34:40,777
I don't think we need look very far
at all to find our new knives.

458
00:34:51,922 --> 00:34:54,492
Demachaerius,
double swords.

459
00:34:57,561 --> 00:35:00,564
I am Atticus, veteran
of the Tenth Legion,

460
00:35:00,597 --> 00:35:03,367
pensioned after honorable
service in Gaul.

461
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:06,503
I'm now free to pursue
more lucrative employment.

462
00:35:06,536 --> 00:35:08,438
Were you
a gladiator?

463
00:35:08,472 --> 00:35:10,374
I was trained
at the ludus in Rome,

464
00:35:10,407 --> 00:35:11,775
where I fought
for my freedom.

465
00:35:11,807 --> 00:35:13,610
I then enlisted
in the Tenth Legion.

466
00:35:13,643 --> 00:35:16,146
Was your retirement
honorable?

467
00:35:16,179 --> 00:35:21,217
It was a honor to fight alongside
the many that died in the Tenth.

468
00:35:21,251 --> 00:35:25,656
That I did not when so many did,
it made me ponder my purpose.

469
00:35:25,688 --> 00:35:28,158
And did you find
said purpose?

470
00:35:28,192 --> 00:35:32,463
Aye, to gather
my brothers and sisters

471
00:35:32,496 --> 00:35:34,597
for future service
of Rome.

472
00:35:34,630 --> 00:35:38,168
I see.
Gratitude, Atticus.

473
00:35:43,706 --> 00:35:45,576
Laquearius.

474
00:35:45,608 --> 00:35:47,411
No need to announce
every one.

475
00:35:47,443 --> 00:35:50,181
We've all been
to the arena.

476
00:35:50,213 --> 00:35:52,182
Are you a Sagartian?

477
00:35:52,215 --> 00:35:53,250
Aye, sir.

478
00:35:53,282 --> 00:35:54,851
I'm from Zagros.

479
00:35:54,885 --> 00:35:56,854
I fought
and won in Rome.

480
00:35:56,887 --> 00:35:58,422
Can you show me how?

481
00:35:58,454 --> 00:36:00,324
A volunteer?

482
00:36:14,637 --> 00:36:18,241
Gratitude.
You may join us.

483
00:36:23,413 --> 00:36:26,550
This is Tauri
from Dacia.

484
00:36:29,820 --> 00:36:31,789
A Scythian?

485
00:36:35,592 --> 00:36:37,494
Does he speak?

486
00:36:39,262 --> 00:36:40,864
If so, we have
not heard him.

487
00:36:40,896 --> 00:36:45,603
But he understands, and his
ax speaks loudly enough.

488
00:36:48,771 --> 00:36:50,540
Is he deaf?

489
00:36:50,574 --> 00:36:52,242
No. It is believed

490
00:36:52,275 --> 00:36:54,377
that he witnessed such
horrors in his youth

491
00:36:54,411 --> 00:36:59,016
when his village was raided that
he lost the ability to speak.

492
00:36:59,048 --> 00:37:02,619
And he bears no ill will
towards Romans?

493
00:37:02,652 --> 00:37:05,521
It was not the Romans
that raided his village.

494
00:37:05,554 --> 00:37:07,290
It was the Budini.

495
00:37:07,324 --> 00:37:10,594
The curs.

496
00:37:10,626 --> 00:37:12,730
He fought with the Romans
to push back the Budinis

497
00:37:12,762 --> 00:37:16,032
into the dark forest
where they rot and fester.

498
00:37:16,065 --> 00:37:21,271
There are few others I
would wish to watch my back.

499
00:37:21,304 --> 00:37:22,806
Welcome, Scythian.

500
00:37:28,411 --> 00:37:30,380
And who might you be?

501
00:37:30,414 --> 00:37:32,549
I am Veleda Araeo.

502
00:37:32,581 --> 00:37:34,550
I trained at
the Collegia luvenum

503
00:37:34,583 --> 00:37:36,352
in Rome
as a gladiatrix.

504
00:37:36,385 --> 00:37:37,954
You were a slave?

505
00:37:39,755 --> 00:37:41,458
I am a free woman,

506
00:37:41,490 --> 00:37:45,628
daughter of Quillius
Araeo, gladiator of Rome.

507
00:37:45,661 --> 00:37:46,896
You were a venatore?

508
00:37:46,929 --> 00:37:48,965
You killed animals
in the hunt in the arena?

509
00:37:48,998 --> 00:37:51,034
Yes.

510
00:37:51,068 --> 00:37:52,836
I also fought
in the arena.

511
00:37:52,869 --> 00:37:54,505
Against gladiatrices?

512
00:37:54,538 --> 00:37:55,706
That is the custom.

513
00:37:56,907 --> 00:37:59,777
You have fought
against men?

514
00:37:59,809 --> 00:38:03,579
That is not the custom
in the arena.

515
00:38:03,612 --> 00:38:07,417
I did fight with the garrison
under Lucius Caedicius

516
00:38:07,451 --> 00:38:09,586
at the Battle
of the Teutoburg Forest.

517
00:38:09,619 --> 00:38:13,490
I stood side by side
with centurion.

518
00:38:13,523 --> 00:38:14,625
I cannot say
for certain,

519
00:38:14,657 --> 00:38:16,661
but I believe
most of them were men.

520
00:38:17,860 --> 00:38:20,096
When the fortress fell,

521
00:38:20,130 --> 00:38:22,865
she was one of the ones
who stayed to fight

522
00:38:22,898 --> 00:38:26,103
to allow the legion
to make their escape.

523
00:38:26,135 --> 00:38:28,371
It was a dark day for
the empire.

524
00:38:28,405 --> 00:38:30,708
You have honored Rome.

525
00:38:30,740 --> 00:38:32,876
Fortune has favored us,
Cyprian.

526
00:38:38,748 --> 00:38:41,751
This is Braga,

527
00:38:41,784 --> 00:38:44,788
the last
of the Gallaeci tribe,

528
00:38:44,820 --> 00:38:46,956
who fought
so formidably

529
00:38:46,989 --> 00:38:51,094
that she was allowed to
live on one condition,

530
00:38:51,128 --> 00:38:52,896
she fight
in the arenas in Rome.

531
00:38:54,731 --> 00:38:57,735
The Gallaecian spirit is
well known in these parts.

532
00:38:57,768 --> 00:39:00,036
Perhaps a demonstration
of the throwing knives.

533
00:39:00,070 --> 00:39:03,606
Are these a tradition
amongst your people?

534
00:39:03,639 --> 00:39:04,907
No, sir.

535
00:39:04,940 --> 00:39:06,909
I have not seen anything
like them before.

536
00:39:06,943 --> 00:39:08,679
I created them myself.

537
00:39:16,952 --> 00:39:18,489
Impressive.

538
00:39:18,521 --> 00:39:20,423
Welcome to our cadre,
Braga.

539
00:39:26,530 --> 00:39:28,399
This is Khutu.

540
00:39:28,431 --> 00:39:31,067
She is from
the Xiongnu clan,

541
00:39:31,101 --> 00:39:33,804
a vast tribe
of bowmen and riders

542
00:39:33,836 --> 00:39:38,041
that roam the vast steppe
to the east of the empire.

543
00:39:38,074 --> 00:39:41,077
And how do you find it here
by the sea so far from home?

544
00:39:41,110 --> 00:39:45,615
The men here bleed
and die in a manner

545
00:39:45,648 --> 00:39:51,621
far superior to those from the
province from which I come.

546
00:39:51,655 --> 00:39:53,824
How so?

547
00:39:53,856 --> 00:39:55,858
I would
not call them weak,

548
00:39:55,891 --> 00:40:00,496
yet a life indoors away
from the wind and sky

549
00:40:00,530 --> 00:40:04,968
makes them fall
quicker to the earth.

550
00:40:05,001 --> 00:40:07,138
Welcome, Khutu.

551
00:40:11,106 --> 00:40:13,943
Sir, I do not mean
to overstep,

552
00:40:13,976 --> 00:40:17,748
but we are here to find soldiers,
not arena sideshow attractions.

553
00:40:17,780 --> 00:40:21,884
Cyprian, your council
is valued well,

554
00:40:21,918 --> 00:40:24,153
but you show
your inexperience.

555
00:40:24,186 --> 00:40:26,856
In many far-flung
regions of the empire,

556
00:40:26,889 --> 00:40:29,893
the women fight
alongside the men.

557
00:40:29,925 --> 00:40:33,663
The valiant nature of such warriors
has been recorded by many.

558
00:40:33,697 --> 00:40:35,599
If Atticus vouches for
them without reservation,

559
00:40:35,632 --> 00:40:36,967
that is
good enough for me.

560
00:40:38,534 --> 00:40:39,803
As you will.

561
00:40:41,871 --> 00:40:46,742
You will assemble at the 17th
Legion garrison at first light.

562
00:40:46,775 --> 00:40:49,212
There, you will receive
your instructions.

563
00:40:49,246 --> 00:40:50,981
Gratitude.

564
00:40:51,014 --> 00:40:53,115
I did not mean
to overstep, sir.

565
00:40:53,148 --> 00:40:56,652
No, I've always valued
you speaking your mind.

566
00:40:56,686 --> 00:40:58,922
So let me ask you
a question.

567
00:40:58,954 --> 00:41:01,724
What method would
you use to flush out

568
00:41:01,757 --> 00:41:04,160
those responsible for
our troubles of late?

569
00:41:04,193 --> 00:41:06,896
I would seek out Sergius.

570
00:41:06,929 --> 00:41:09,732
Someone in his employ
must have given away our plan.

571
00:41:09,766 --> 00:41:13,769
The best way to gauge someone's
reaction in the future

572
00:41:13,802 --> 00:41:17,139
is to see how they
reacted in the past.

573
00:41:17,172 --> 00:41:18,975
With that in mind,

574
00:41:19,009 --> 00:41:21,844
I propose
a different strategy,

575
00:41:21,878 --> 00:41:23,646
one where
it does not matter

576
00:41:23,679 --> 00:41:25,281
from whose lips
the information spilled.

577
00:41:25,315 --> 00:41:28,786
One where it may, in fact,
benefit from the spilling.

578
00:41:36,826 --> 00:41:38,061
In the arena,
women were pitted

579
00:41:38,094 --> 00:41:40,063
against animals
and other women,

580
00:41:40,096 --> 00:41:41,565
but in
a real-life battle,

581
00:41:41,597 --> 00:41:43,166
there are
no such rules.

582
00:41:43,199 --> 00:41:46,637
Your opponent's size or sex
should not be taken lightly.

583
00:41:46,670 --> 00:41:49,806
Reach is an advantage,
but speed and agility

584
00:41:49,838 --> 00:41:52,275
can overcome
a larger opponent.

585
00:42:00,916 --> 00:42:03,786
Hyah!

586
00:42:03,820 --> 00:42:05,222
You must know
where to strike

587
00:42:05,255 --> 00:42:07,057
and have
the presence of mind

588
00:42:07,090 --> 00:42:08,893
to seize that moment
when presented with it.

589
00:42:12,996 --> 00:42:16,534
Use your opponent's weight
and momentum against them.

590
00:42:23,907 --> 00:42:24,909
Better.

591
00:42:28,210 --> 00:42:29,646
Right thrust.

592
00:42:31,081 --> 00:42:32,849
Left side strike.

593
00:42:34,684 --> 00:42:36,186
Right side strike.

594
00:42:38,021 --> 00:42:39,023
Uppercut.

595
00:42:40,090 --> 00:42:41,191
Downward strike.

596
00:42:42,257 --> 00:42:44,360
Good. Now faster.

597
00:42:44,393 --> 00:42:45,962
Straight thrust.

598
00:42:45,996 --> 00:42:47,631
Left side strike.

599
00:42:48,797 --> 00:42:50,000
Right side strike.

600
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:53,669
Uppercut.

601
00:42:53,702 --> 00:42:55,371
Downward strike.

602
00:42:55,405 --> 00:42:56,607
Very good.

603
00:42:56,639 --> 00:42:57,807
Now switch roles.

604
00:42:59,041 --> 00:43:00,978
I'm ready to
tear the Romans apart

605
00:43:01,010 --> 00:43:03,279
like a wild Illyrian dog
on a hare.

606
00:43:03,313 --> 00:43:05,983
You speak like a
Thracian, Aurelia.

607
00:43:06,016 --> 00:43:08,918
I'll drink the Roman's
blood, Darius.

608
00:43:14,657 --> 00:43:16,626
Line up!

609
00:43:19,795 --> 00:43:23,199
You're ready to go up
against the Romans?

610
00:43:35,978 --> 00:43:37,614
Ready.

611
00:43:45,255 --> 00:43:46,356
Ready.

612
00:43:51,293 --> 00:43:52,929
Let's see it.

613
00:43:56,465 --> 00:43:57,900
Are you ready?

614
00:44:06,376 --> 00:44:07,344
Ready?

615
00:44:07,376 --> 00:44:08,878
No?

616
00:44:15,985 --> 00:44:18,088
If you believe you
have mastered something,

617
00:44:18,121 --> 00:44:19,756
you are no longer
the master.

618
00:44:19,789 --> 00:44:22,059
You are a fool.

619
00:44:23,226 --> 00:44:25,327
A wise man
knows his limitations

620
00:44:25,360 --> 00:44:28,364
and does not pick a fight
he has little chance of winning.

621
00:44:31,034 --> 00:44:32,903
Think on that.

622
00:44:39,442 --> 00:44:41,777
So how are we doing,

623
00:44:41,811 --> 00:44:45,414
exceeding
your expectations?

624
00:44:45,447 --> 00:44:48,317
If one could kill with mirth,
you would be a champion.

625
00:44:48,351 --> 00:44:49,952
Believe me, I've tried.

626
00:44:49,985 --> 00:44:51,387
It's just
as ineffective.

627
00:44:55,824 --> 00:44:58,861
You have two things
going for you.

628
00:44:58,894 --> 00:45:01,431
You are young,
and you are determined.

629
00:45:01,463 --> 00:45:05,802
But you are headstrong
and quick to rush into a fray.

630
00:45:07,302 --> 00:45:09,405
You must learn control.

631
00:45:09,438 --> 00:45:12,108
When will we be
ready to fight?

632
00:45:15,144 --> 00:45:17,880
Two, maybe three years
of constant training.

633
00:45:19,315 --> 00:45:21,083
Then you might survive
an encounter

634
00:45:21,117 --> 00:45:23,186
with a soldier
of the likes stationed here.

635
00:45:23,219 --> 00:45:26,289
And these men are
not seasoned veterans.

636
00:45:26,322 --> 00:45:29,259
If you were to go up
against a soldier from Rome,

637
00:45:29,291 --> 00:45:33,963
one from the campaigns or one
with gladiatorial experience,

638
00:45:33,996 --> 00:45:37,533
your prospects of survival
would diminish rapidly.

639
00:45:37,567 --> 00:45:41,003
I don't have time to sit
and hide in the woods.

640
00:45:43,172 --> 00:45:46,208
If you were to go up
against the Romans now,

641
00:45:46,242 --> 00:45:48,945
it would be a conflict
remembered only for its brevity.

642
00:45:48,978 --> 00:45:50,780
But you didn't say
who'd be the victor.

643
00:45:55,150 --> 00:45:57,186
Why are you
in such a rush to die?

644
00:45:59,088 --> 00:46:02,493
Living under the Romans,
I might as well be dead.

645
00:46:05,195 --> 00:46:06,930
Teach me how to ride
the chariot.

646
00:46:09,132 --> 00:46:11,867
Learn the basics first.

647
00:46:11,900 --> 00:46:14,337
Then we'll move
to mounted combat.

648
00:46:44,266 --> 00:46:45,868
Gather your men
and your mercenaries.

649
00:46:52,407 --> 00:46:54,510
Give me an hour.

650
00:46:54,543 --> 00:46:56,980
I'll have what you need.

651
00:47:12,996 --> 00:47:14,597
It's not much.

652
00:47:14,630 --> 00:47:16,232
The Romans took
most of the weapons

653
00:47:16,266 --> 00:47:17,901
when they captured
the province.

654
00:47:17,934 --> 00:47:19,536
Iberian steel.

655
00:47:21,403 --> 00:47:24,206
Roman steel,

656
00:47:24,239 --> 00:47:26,876
the foundation
of their empire.

657
00:47:26,909 --> 00:47:29,178
Found in their swords

658
00:47:29,211 --> 00:47:32,449
and in the nails that build
their fortifications.

659
00:47:33,650 --> 00:47:35,485
The secrets
of Roman tempered steel

660
00:47:35,518 --> 00:47:37,519
are what allowed them
to rule over so many.

661
00:47:37,552 --> 00:47:38,922
My father worked
the marble mines

662
00:47:38,954 --> 00:47:40,322
until it was
the death of him.

663
00:47:40,356 --> 00:47:43,493
Many of these swords
were fashioned there.

664
00:47:43,525 --> 00:47:46,562
Weapons such as these should
be used as a last resort.

665
00:47:48,563 --> 00:47:51,067
That's why we're training,
to kill the Romans.

666
00:47:51,099 --> 00:47:54,070
No. You have been
learning how to survive.

667
00:47:55,938 --> 00:47:58,207
Adrian!

668
00:47:59,608 --> 00:48:02,077
The Romans
are in the village.

669
00:48:02,110 --> 00:48:04,146
They are lining up people
on the wall outside town.

670
00:48:04,179 --> 00:48:05,382
They're hunting
those responsible

671
00:48:05,414 --> 00:48:07,650
for foiling the raid
on the river camp.

672
00:48:07,684 --> 00:48:09,252
Stay here, all of you.

673
00:48:09,284 --> 00:48:10,420
If you
wish to remain alive,

674
00:48:10,452 --> 00:48:11,420
refrain from following.

675
00:48:11,454 --> 00:48:12,956
But these
are my people.

676
00:48:12,989 --> 00:48:14,458
You are not ready.

677
00:48:25,335 --> 00:48:26,970
Lucia, stay behind.

678
00:50:00,128 --> 00:50:03,065
I am the one
you are looking for.

679
00:50:03,099 --> 00:50:04,601
You alone
were responsible?

680
00:50:04,634 --> 00:50:07,403
I did hire
some local sell-swords,

681
00:50:07,436 --> 00:50:09,371
but they were
of negligible worth.

682
00:50:09,405 --> 00:50:11,441
They are no longer
in my employ.

683
00:50:11,474 --> 00:50:15,412
You do understand that your
offense is punishable by death?

684
00:50:15,445 --> 00:50:17,180
I was hoping
I might be rewarded

685
00:50:17,213 --> 00:50:19,182
with a villa in Cyprus,

686
00:50:19,215 --> 00:50:22,184
but I am unfamiliar
with current Roman statutes.

687
00:50:22,217 --> 00:50:24,553
Good sir...

688
00:50:24,586 --> 00:50:28,690
I propose we save Rome
the expense of a trial

689
00:50:28,724 --> 00:50:30,527
and
the laborious process

690
00:50:30,559 --> 00:50:34,764
of witnessing the
machinations of justice.

691
00:50:34,797 --> 00:50:36,565
In our fine province,

692
00:50:36,599 --> 00:50:38,735
I propose
trial by sword.

693
00:50:46,175 --> 00:50:48,144
Sir, this is
rather unorthodox.

694
00:50:48,177 --> 00:50:49,211
Silence.

695
00:50:57,253 --> 00:50:58,555
But he is unarmed.

696
00:50:59,789 --> 00:51:01,858
His mistake.

697
00:52:02,451 --> 00:52:03,686
Go ahead.

698
00:52:03,719 --> 00:52:04,887
Finish him.

699
00:52:04,920 --> 00:52:06,856
As you wish.

700
00:52:46,628 --> 00:52:47,697
Move.

701
00:53:01,010 --> 00:53:02,778
I told you to stay back.

702
00:53:02,811 --> 00:53:04,346
You should be grateful
we didn't.

703
00:53:19,327 --> 00:53:21,431
If you want to live,
leave now.

704
00:53:21,463 --> 00:53:22,465
You'll be killed.

705
00:53:24,833 --> 00:53:26,835
That may be,

706
00:53:26,869 --> 00:53:30,774
but if we all die,
who will continue the fight?

707
00:53:32,842 --> 00:53:34,244
Steady. Steady.

708
00:53:34,277 --> 00:53:35,612
We must retreat
to the garrison.

709
00:53:35,644 --> 00:53:37,246
Gather reinforcements.

710
00:53:37,280 --> 00:53:38,248
You are wise.

711
00:53:38,280 --> 00:53:39,615
I will engage
the enemy

712
00:53:39,648 --> 00:53:42,284
while Kaeso will take
you back to the fort.

713
00:53:44,853 --> 00:53:46,055
Step aside.

714
00:53:46,056 --> 00:53:47,256
We do not retreat.

715
00:53:47,289 --> 00:53:49,492
You may stay and fight,
but we must get the Legatus

716
00:53:49,525 --> 00:53:50,860
back to the garrison
for treatment.

717
00:53:50,893 --> 00:53:52,427
I have seen
many injuries in battle.

718
00:53:52,460 --> 00:53:54,663
This one does not look
life-threatening.

719
00:53:54,697 --> 00:53:55,965
We stay and fight.

720
00:53:55,998 --> 00:53:57,900
I would think again
on the consequences

721
00:53:57,932 --> 00:54:00,302
before disobeying a direct
order from a Roman official.

722
00:54:00,335 --> 00:54:02,738
Orders or no, if it
were to become known

723
00:54:02,771 --> 00:54:05,275
that we were defeated by one
man and a band of children,

724
00:54:05,307 --> 00:54:07,876
how often do you think I'd
find myself in employ?

725
00:54:07,909 --> 00:54:10,445
We stay and fight,
and we shall prevail.

726
00:54:10,478 --> 00:54:11,880
Of this, I am certain.

727
00:54:11,914 --> 00:54:13,816
Send a runner
to the garrison.

728
00:54:13,849 --> 00:54:15,418
We stay and fight.

729
00:54:25,393 --> 00:54:27,996
It is not worth losing
everything over one life.

730
00:54:28,030 --> 00:54:29,666
I want to stay
and fight.

731
00:54:32,635 --> 00:54:34,304
Think of your sister.

732
00:54:35,603 --> 00:54:37,673
Go.

733
00:55:02,664 --> 00:55:04,601
Caius!

734
00:55:07,902 --> 00:55:10,072
Go.

735
00:55:10,106 --> 00:55:11,074
Get him to safety.

736
00:55:13,876 --> 00:55:16,379
Leave now, or your friend
will have died in vain.

737
00:55:16,411 --> 00:55:18,347
No! I can stay and fight.

738
00:55:21,416 --> 00:55:23,920
Your death here
will not be remembered.

739
00:55:23,952 --> 00:55:24,887
Now go!

740
00:55:29,724 --> 00:55:32,461
Go. Go! Go!

741
00:55:55,717 --> 00:55:57,820
Execute him.

742
00:56:04,793 --> 00:56:05,894
What is your name?

743
00:56:08,864 --> 00:56:11,166
What does it
matter to you?

744
00:56:11,199 --> 00:56:16,004
The body may die,
yet the name may live on.

745
00:56:16,038 --> 00:56:17,706
Give me your name.

746
00:56:24,847 --> 00:56:28,918
My name
is Judah Ben-Hur.

747
00:56:48,137 --> 00:56:49,806
Well, what are
you waiting for?!

748
00:56:49,838 --> 00:56:50,572
Execute him!

749
00:56:51,974 --> 00:56:53,943
There is value
in this name in Rome.

750
00:56:53,976 --> 00:56:55,778
You are free
to take the name.

751
00:56:55,811 --> 00:56:57,079
You shall give me
his head.

752
00:56:57,112 --> 00:56:59,449
This man shall
not be executed today.

753
00:56:59,481 --> 00:57:01,684
You dare defy me?!

754
00:57:01,717 --> 00:57:04,619
This man is worth far
more alive than dead.

755
00:57:04,652 --> 00:57:07,022
Take him back
to the arenas in Rome,

756
00:57:07,056 --> 00:57:10,126
and we will be paid tenfold
what we have been paid today.

757
00:57:10,159 --> 00:57:11,894
I will execute
this man myself.

758
00:57:13,996 --> 00:57:16,731
I did not enter this field
to spill Roman blood,

759
00:57:16,764 --> 00:57:19,534
but I guarantee that if
more blood is spilled,

760
00:57:19,568 --> 00:57:20,804
some of it
will be Roman.

761
00:57:25,840 --> 00:57:27,509
I will have
your heads for this.

762
00:57:29,811 --> 00:57:32,449
You will join a long list who
have uttered those words.

763
00:57:35,083 --> 00:57:36,952
This is insubordination.

764
00:57:36,985 --> 00:57:38,788
How can I abide...

765
00:57:38,820 --> 00:57:41,156
Sir, hear me out.

766
00:57:41,190 --> 00:57:44,126
In this matter, prudence
may be best tact.

767
00:57:44,159 --> 00:57:45,994
Would not there not
be more glory in Rome

768
00:57:46,027 --> 00:57:47,762
for us to send this captive
back to the arena,

769
00:57:47,795 --> 00:57:49,898
where his death can
match his reputation?

770
00:57:51,934 --> 00:57:53,936
That may be so,

771
00:57:53,969 --> 00:57:56,172
but if we
let them leave,

772
00:57:56,204 --> 00:57:58,807
who will remain to take care
of the rebels who've escaped?

773
00:57:58,840 --> 00:58:00,809
Pardon, sir, but speaking
from experience,

774
00:58:00,842 --> 00:58:03,178
the rebels you talk of
are barely men. I...

775
00:58:03,211 --> 00:58:06,047
Kaeso, when your opinion
is required,

776
00:58:06,081 --> 00:58:07,048
I will ask of it.

777
00:58:12,755 --> 00:58:15,758
You are in my employ.

778
00:58:15,791 --> 00:58:17,960
You were hired
to eradicate these rebels

779
00:58:17,992 --> 00:58:19,795
by any means possible.

780
00:58:19,827 --> 00:58:21,831
The capture of one
while many escape

781
00:58:21,864 --> 00:58:24,867
is not a task
taken to completion.

782
00:58:24,900 --> 00:58:26,668
I doubt you'll
have much trouble

783
00:58:26,702 --> 00:58:28,704
finding the rest by
their showing today.

784
00:58:28,737 --> 00:58:31,072
This one is the only
one worthy of capture.

785
00:58:31,106 --> 00:58:35,745
Sir, I am confident we can capture the
rest of these miscreants in short order,

786
00:58:35,777 --> 00:58:37,980
but there may also be
a way which allows Atticus

787
00:58:38,012 --> 00:58:40,115
to take
this Ben-Hur to Rome

788
00:58:40,148 --> 00:58:43,018
while at the same time draw
out the rest of these rebels,

789
00:58:43,052 --> 00:58:44,354
if I may be so bold.

790
00:58:44,355 --> 00:58:45,655
Go on.

791
00:58:45,688 --> 00:58:47,657
Allow Atticus
to take this Ben-Hur

792
00:58:47,690 --> 00:58:51,760
on a road well known and seen by
many as he leaves this village.

793
00:58:51,793 --> 00:58:54,763
That way, word will get
back to those who aid him.

794
00:58:54,797 --> 00:58:56,731
We can set up an intercept
on this known road

795
00:58:56,764 --> 00:58:59,668
and take them
by surprise.

796
00:59:02,838 --> 00:59:03,907
Very well.

797
00:59:10,244 --> 00:59:11,179
On your feet.

798
00:59:33,735 --> 00:59:35,971
Which is the weaker
of the sexes?

799
00:59:36,005 --> 00:59:38,007
Is it the field from
which the crop grows

800
00:59:38,039 --> 00:59:40,242
or the one who merely
plants the seed?

801
00:59:40,275 --> 00:59:43,012
Is it not
a more difficult job

802
00:59:43,045 --> 00:59:45,681
to grow and nurture
the crop for harvest,

803
00:59:45,713 --> 00:59:49,384
than to lay a mere
seed in the soil?

804
00:59:49,418 --> 00:59:53,055
I think your soil
has seen many seeds.

805
00:59:55,423 --> 00:59:58,226
If you prefer your
fruits attached, Dio,

806
00:59:58,260 --> 01:00:00,229
I suggest you
stop speaking.

807
01:00:00,262 --> 01:00:01,897
Gratitude, Atticus.

808
01:00:01,929 --> 01:00:05,067
I would prefer
not to soil my blades.

809
01:00:05,099 --> 01:00:07,235
What were
we talking about?

810
01:00:07,268 --> 01:00:10,339
Yes,
the weaker sex.

811
01:00:11,673 --> 01:00:14,876
Khutu, do you know
who this is?

812
01:00:14,909 --> 01:00:18,413
He is someone whom
the gods do not favor.

813
01:00:18,447 --> 01:00:20,282
How 'bout you, Veleda?

814
01:00:20,315 --> 01:00:23,052
I do not know,
and I do not care.

815
01:00:23,085 --> 01:00:27,322
I wager in Rome we'll hear a different
answer to the name Ben-Hur.

816
01:00:27,356 --> 01:00:28,791
What do you think?

817
01:00:31,827 --> 01:00:35,064
In times of old, your name was
known from Judaea to Hispania.

818
01:00:35,097 --> 01:00:37,333
I suspect, in Rome,

819
01:00:37,365 --> 01:00:41,737
many will savor
your death in the arena.

820
01:00:41,769 --> 01:00:44,206
Maybe the fates
will allow you to live.

821
01:00:44,239 --> 01:00:46,208
It's up to the gods.

822
01:00:46,240 --> 01:00:48,943
Or should I say God
in your case?

823
01:00:48,976 --> 01:00:50,945
You took
to the new religion.

824
01:00:50,978 --> 01:00:53,048
Well, let me ask you,
where is your God now?

825
01:00:54,416 --> 01:00:56,318
Can you not speak?

826
01:00:56,351 --> 01:00:58,253
The road to Rome
is long and tiresome.

827
01:00:58,286 --> 01:01:02,357
The least you could do is show
some gratitude for being saved.

828
01:01:02,391 --> 01:01:04,393
Entertain us with
some stories of old.

829
01:01:04,425 --> 01:01:08,197
Were you not a galley slave
before the Macedonians at sea

830
01:01:08,230 --> 01:01:10,365
in a battle
to the last man?

831
01:01:10,398 --> 01:01:12,801
Is that not
the tale of Ben-Hur?

832
01:01:12,835 --> 01:01:16,972
The one who saved the Roman
consul, became his adoptive son?

833
01:01:17,005 --> 01:01:19,008
Rode
the chariots in Rome

834
01:01:19,041 --> 01:01:20,910
in the bloody arena?

835
01:01:21,976 --> 01:01:23,913
Can you not speak?

836
01:01:25,246 --> 01:01:26,949
I could have severed
your head from your body

837
01:01:26,981 --> 01:01:28,983
as that fool instructed.

838
01:01:30,485 --> 01:01:34,222
Someone with your skills may
even find favor in Rome.

839
01:01:34,255 --> 01:01:35,757
Anything's possible.

840
01:01:35,791 --> 01:01:38,794
What say you, old man?

841
01:01:40,295 --> 01:01:42,865
What is it
you ponder so seriously?

842
01:01:42,898 --> 01:01:46,135
Do you pray to your God
for a quick death?

843
01:01:46,168 --> 01:01:49,872
He's praying for quiet.

844
01:01:52,507 --> 01:01:54,476
What of the ambush
laid by the Romans?

845
01:01:54,510 --> 01:01:56,512
Will they not rob us
of our prize?

846
01:01:56,545 --> 01:01:58,914
The answer is simple.

847
01:01:58,947 --> 01:02:00,750
We'll take another road.

848
01:02:00,782 --> 01:02:02,150
Romans will never find us.

849
01:02:40,889 --> 01:02:42,958
Caius, Caius,
look at me! Look at me!

850
01:02:42,990 --> 01:02:44,492
This is gonna hurt.

851
01:02:44,525 --> 01:02:46,895
1, 2, 3.

852
01:02:50,532 --> 01:02:52,535
Keep it pressed.

853
01:02:54,036 --> 01:02:55,503
-Look after him.
-I will.

854
01:02:55,536 --> 01:02:57,071
Tell my sister
I love her.

855
01:02:57,105 --> 01:02:59,541
You will be able to tell
her soon enough yourself.

856
01:02:59,574 --> 01:03:01,476
Stay strong.

857
01:03:03,045 --> 01:03:05,548
You'll be fine, Caius.

858
01:03:22,097 --> 01:03:26,001
I did not think I would
die so far from Rome.

859
01:03:26,034 --> 01:03:28,003
Do not
say it so, sir.

860
01:03:28,036 --> 01:03:30,873
You must realize, Cyprian...

861
01:03:37,512 --> 01:03:39,081
Promise me one thing.

862
01:03:41,115 --> 01:03:43,186
Take my ashes to Rome.

863
01:03:45,621 --> 01:03:47,123
I will see it done, sir.

864
01:05:22,384 --> 01:05:24,186
You asked earlier
what I was mediating on.

865
01:05:28,990 --> 01:05:31,693
The question I was pondering
was whether or not

866
01:05:31,726 --> 01:05:34,362
it was acceptable
to take a life again.

867
01:05:34,396 --> 01:05:36,098
I'm curious
as to your answer.

868
01:05:37,498 --> 01:05:39,634
I decided
I could take a life

869
01:05:39,668 --> 01:05:43,972
if I left the decision on
whether or not to lose the life

870
01:05:44,005 --> 01:05:46,208
to the one
whose life is taken.

871
01:05:51,512 --> 01:05:52,581
If you want to live,

872
01:05:52,614 --> 01:05:54,416
release me
and leave this place.

873
01:05:55,583 --> 01:05:58,219
If you prefer to die,
remain here.

874
01:06:00,521 --> 01:06:02,023
Choice is yours.

875
01:06:08,429 --> 01:06:10,565
Very generous of you.

876
01:06:13,635 --> 01:06:16,372
Were you not such
a valuable commodity,

877
01:06:16,405 --> 01:06:18,673
I would dismember you
where you sit.

878
01:06:21,076 --> 01:06:23,144
I take it you have
made your decision?

879
01:06:38,760 --> 01:06:40,796
Tauri, stay here.
Guard Ben-Hur.

880
01:06:40,829 --> 01:06:42,565
Everyone else,
come with me!

881
01:08:04,146 --> 01:08:05,347
Hyah!

882
01:09:20,755 --> 01:09:22,625
Do we still take him alive?

883
01:09:25,327 --> 01:09:26,462
No.

884
01:09:35,636 --> 01:09:36,971
Hyah!

885
01:09:37,005 --> 01:09:38,407
Here.

886
01:09:42,877 --> 01:09:45,347
The horses are backwards.
The horses are backwards!

887
01:09:45,380 --> 01:09:46,748
They look like they're
facing the right way to me.

888
01:09:46,780 --> 01:09:48,684
No, they're
on the wrong sides!

889
01:09:48,716 --> 01:09:50,918
This one's used to being on the
left and that one on the right!

890
01:09:50,952 --> 01:09:52,588
Is that
a big problem?

891
01:09:52,621 --> 01:09:54,590
Let's hope we don't have
to make any sharp turns!

892
01:09:54,622 --> 01:09:55,756
Since when
do horses have sides?!

893
01:09:55,789 --> 01:09:56,992
If you had listened
in training...

894
01:09:57,024 --> 01:09:58,793
Hey, I was listening,

895
01:09:58,827 --> 01:10:01,663
and I specifically remember nothing
about horses having sides!

896
01:10:01,695 --> 01:10:03,832
And another thing, I told you
to stay out of this!

897
01:10:03,864 --> 01:10:06,734
Yeah, well, it's a
little late for that!

898
01:10:06,768 --> 01:10:08,604
And a thanks
would be nice!

899
01:10:08,636 --> 01:10:09,938
Thanks!

900
01:10:09,970 --> 01:10:11,255
Hyah! Hyah!

901
01:10:11,256 --> 01:10:12,540
Hyah! Hyah!

902
01:10:16,043 --> 01:10:18,546
Hyah! Hyah! Hyah!

903
01:10:27,721 --> 01:10:29,423
Hyah! How many?

904
01:10:29,457 --> 01:10:30,993
Three, coming up fast.

905
01:10:32,761 --> 01:10:33,795
Not yet!

906
01:10:33,828 --> 01:10:34,763
Wait till
they're in range.

907
01:10:41,569 --> 01:10:43,572
Go! After them!

908
01:11:09,396 --> 01:11:11,432
Hyah! Hyah! Hyah!

909
01:11:30,118 --> 01:11:32,788
Hyah! Hyah! Hyah!

910
01:12:43,123 --> 01:12:45,726
Hyah! Hyah!

911
01:12:45,760 --> 01:12:46,695
Hyah!

912
01:16:28,416 --> 01:16:30,819
This wench must not
mean anything to you

913
01:16:30,851 --> 01:16:33,320
if you are
so quick to see her die.

914
01:16:34,855 --> 01:16:36,957
If you want her to live,
be smart.

915
01:16:36,990 --> 01:16:39,360
Surrender your weapons.

916
01:16:39,394 --> 01:16:40,695
None of you
have any value.

917
01:16:40,728 --> 01:16:43,164
I'm looking for Ben-Hur.

918
01:17:03,784 --> 01:17:05,153
Yah!

919
01:17:43,224 --> 01:17:47,029
If I were to hand Ben-Hur over
to you, I'd be dead anyway.

920
01:17:51,131 --> 01:17:52,768
So be it.

921
01:21:00,654 --> 01:21:02,590
And what is your name?

922
01:21:04,257 --> 01:21:05,926
Atti...

923
01:21:09,195 --> 01:21:11,365
Tell it to the oarsman.

924
01:21:19,006 --> 01:21:20,208
Press this on here.

925
01:21:27,681 --> 01:21:29,451
Is she going to live?

926
01:21:33,154 --> 01:21:35,056
Depends on her.

927
01:22:17,364 --> 01:22:19,400
Are you truly Ben-Hur?

928
01:22:23,570 --> 01:22:26,606
I will go with you
if I must,

929
01:22:26,640 --> 01:22:28,977
but leave them.

930
01:22:34,782 --> 01:22:37,485
There's been enough
bloodshed here for one day.

931
01:22:37,518 --> 01:22:38,485
Sir!

932
01:22:38,519 --> 01:22:39,988
Silence.

933
01:22:43,791 --> 01:22:48,697
I am the grandson of Quintus
Arrius, Consul of Rome.

934
01:22:51,198 --> 01:22:53,401
Growing up, my grandfather
used to entertain me

935
01:22:53,434 --> 01:22:55,136
with many stories
about Ben-Hur.

936
01:22:57,337 --> 01:22:58,706
The one
I am most grateful for

937
01:22:58,738 --> 01:23:01,074
is that Ben-Hur saved
my grandfather's life

938
01:23:01,108 --> 01:23:02,310
when their galley
was sunk

939
01:23:02,342 --> 01:23:06,279
by Macedonian pirates
in the great sea.

940
01:23:06,313 --> 01:23:09,016
You saved his life, even
though he was a Roman.

941
01:23:13,287 --> 01:23:15,757
You were his adopted
son, were you not?

942
01:23:18,091 --> 01:23:20,494
It is true.

943
01:23:20,528 --> 01:23:23,398
Then you shall go
in peace.

944
01:23:23,430 --> 01:23:26,500
You have the word
of Cyprian Arrius.

945
01:23:47,587 --> 01:23:50,157
With a larger force,
we can rout the Romans.

946
01:23:50,190 --> 01:23:51,591
I'm sure of it.

947
01:23:51,625 --> 01:23:54,194
Once Lucia and Caius
are recovered,

948
01:23:54,228 --> 01:23:57,731
we can begin our aim to
recruit an army of freemen.

949
01:23:57,765 --> 01:23:59,233
With your training...

950
01:23:59,265 --> 01:24:00,233
we could...

951
01:24:00,266 --> 01:24:01,836
Open warfare
with the Romans

952
01:24:01,868 --> 01:24:03,804
is not something
I'm interested in.

953
01:24:06,106 --> 01:24:09,077
But if, one day,
you find yourself in need,

954
01:24:09,109 --> 01:24:10,377
call my name.

955
01:24:11,744 --> 01:24:15,182
If you call it loud
and ring it wide,

956
01:24:15,216 --> 01:24:16,818
perhaps we
shall meet again.
