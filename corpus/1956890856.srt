00:01:24,884 --> 00:01:27,288
We're back from the hunt.
Tell the butcher.

3
00:01:43,537 --> 00:01:46,173
Sort out those horns
and put them on the table.

4
00:01:46,207 --> 00:01:47,874
And get the blood
off these horns.

5
00:01:47,907 --> 00:01:49,842
You know the dogs
will smell them at Customs.

6
00:01:49,876 --> 00:01:52,213
- They've got to be clean.
- You got it, boss.

7
00:01:52,246 --> 00:01:55,115
- Ah, this side is messy.
- Yep.

8
00:01:55,149 --> 00:01:56,450
Got the kill shot...

9
00:01:56,483 --> 00:01:59,819
Oh, yeah, messy.
Head, claws, and hide?

10
00:01:59,852 --> 00:02:01,988
- Same, same.
- Got it.

11
00:02:02,021 --> 00:02:03,524
- Now.
- Another hunt later?

12
00:02:03,557 --> 00:02:06,360
Some Americans in an hour.
So which one do you want?

13
00:02:07,561 --> 00:02:09,963
Uh, boss,
which one do you want?

14
00:02:09,996 --> 00:02:11,097
Mm...

15
00:02:14,834 --> 00:02:18,738
They want a male, so, uh...
this one, number seven.

16
00:02:20,341 --> 00:02:21,908
Time's up, Donnie.

17
00:02:21,941 --> 00:02:24,411
Oh, yeah.

18
00:02:24,445 --> 00:02:26,180
Gonna run out
if this keeps up.

19
00:02:26,213 --> 00:02:27,880
Ah, so what?
We can get more.

20
00:02:27,914 --> 00:02:29,216
- Hmm.
- Business is good.

21
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:31,151
We can get more,
right, boss?

22
00:02:31,185 --> 00:02:33,987
Oh, yeah.

23
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:35,556
Put it on the flame, boys.

24
00:02:39,058 --> 00:02:40,294
These are
ready for shipping.

25
00:02:40,327 --> 00:02:41,428
Put them with the others.

26
00:02:41,462 --> 00:02:43,029
Ready.

27
00:02:48,269 --> 00:02:50,137
Move, move. Go.

28
00:02:54,941 --> 00:02:56,477
Come on.
Quick, quick! Pull!

29
00:02:56,510 --> 00:02:57,877
- She's heavy.
- Pull.

30
00:02:57,910 --> 00:02:59,280
Send another.
Come on, come on.

31
00:02:59,313 --> 00:03:02,283
Move! Come on!

32
00:03:03,950 --> 00:03:05,018
Get up!

33
00:03:07,321 --> 00:03:08,821
Get down!

34
00:03:08,855 --> 00:03:10,157
She's in.

35
00:03:12,359 --> 00:03:14,161
- Got it, boss.
- That's it.

36
00:03:15,162 --> 00:03:16,363
Right there. Keep to it.

37
00:03:23,304 --> 00:03:24,405
Keep still. Pull it up.

38
00:03:26,106 --> 00:03:27,408
She's down!

39
00:03:31,245 --> 00:03:32,579
Come on, move!

40
00:03:38,419 --> 00:03:40,354
Hey, hey!
I don't think she's dead!

41
00:03:42,189 --> 00:03:43,324
Get out of there!
She's not dead.

42
00:03:57,271 --> 00:03:59,106
What the fuck
is going on in there?

43
00:04:00,307 --> 00:04:02,209
I've told
you both before, don't...

44
00:04:36,943 --> 00:04:38,278
Hey.

45
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:40,647
Hey, come on.

46
00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:46,387
- Where are the rhino horns?
- Here.

47
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:48,054
And the ivory
you asked for.

48
00:04:48,087 --> 00:04:49,456
Where are the rhino horns?

49
00:04:49,490 --> 00:04:51,191
There's no rhinos.
You killed them all, man.

50
00:04:56,263 --> 00:04:57,964
How many guards are inside?

51
00:04:59,266 --> 00:05:00,634
At least four.

52
00:05:02,503 --> 00:05:04,538
Rogue One for Rogue Two.
Send sitrep.

53
00:05:07,574 --> 00:05:10,277
Good to go, boss.

54
00:05:12,579 --> 00:05:14,080
<i>Stand by.</i>

55
00:05:15,716 --> 00:05:17,718
Copy you.

56
00:05:17,751 --> 00:05:19,420
<i>Standing by.</i>

57
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:30,431
Just a quick job, she said.

58
00:05:30,464 --> 00:05:32,232
Just a snatch and grab,
she said.

59
00:05:32,266 --> 00:05:33,667
What do you want?

60
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:35,269
I wanna get paid
and get out of here.

61
00:05:35,302 --> 00:05:36,470
I got places to be.

62
00:05:36,503 --> 00:05:38,372
Oh, you owe money
again, Joey?

63
00:05:38,405 --> 00:05:42,643
So it's a girl this time,
huh? Or a boy.

64
00:05:42,676 --> 00:05:45,679
I-I don't judge. I don't judge.

65
00:05:47,748 --> 00:05:51,118
Your fireworks
are ready and set.

66
00:05:51,151 --> 00:05:53,353
How you wanna do this?

67
00:05:53,387 --> 00:05:55,722
Sunset's in an hour.

68
00:05:55,756 --> 00:05:58,292
I say we sit tight
and then... boom!

69
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:03,497
Why does everything always
have to be so noisy around you?

70
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:06,032
You know, a girl's
gotta make an entrance.

71
00:06:06,065 --> 00:06:09,068
Hm? Hm? Hm?

72
00:06:15,442 --> 00:06:17,678
<i>Be aware that the
asset is in the green hut.</i>

73
00:06:17,711 --> 00:06:19,346
Green hut. Solid copy.

74
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:21,782
<i>♪ Am I original ♪</i>

75
00:06:21,815 --> 00:06:23,116
<i>♪ Yeah ♪</i>

76
00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:25,319
<i>♪ Am I the only one? ♪</i>

77
00:06:25,352 --> 00:06:27,154
<i>♪ Yeah ♪</i>

78
00:06:27,187 --> 00:06:29,523
<i>♪ Am I sexual? ♪</i>

79
00:06:29,556 --> 00:06:31,458
Why do you
like that song so much?

80
00:06:31,492 --> 00:06:34,595
I don't, it's a fucking earwig.
I hate it.

81
00:06:34,628 --> 00:06:37,464
But it keeps me awake
when I'm hanging out with you.

82
00:06:37,498 --> 00:06:39,098
You have a beautiful
singing voice.

83
00:06:50,577 --> 00:06:52,546
You need
to read this, boss.

84
00:06:55,282 --> 00:06:57,251
Shit!

85
00:06:57,284 --> 00:06:59,653
Okay, we go now.

86
00:06:59,686 --> 00:07:01,455
What now?
What happened to dark?

87
00:07:01,488 --> 00:07:04,023
There's no time.
They're moving the asset.

88
00:07:06,326 --> 00:07:09,296
Pata, are you sure
about this building?

89
00:07:09,329 --> 00:07:11,598
I think so.

90
00:07:11,632 --> 00:07:13,065
You think so,
or you know so?

91
00:07:13,099 --> 00:07:14,801
The difference can mean
all of our lives.

92
00:07:14,835 --> 00:07:16,537
That is what my contact
told me.

93
00:07:22,376 --> 00:07:23,277
Ahem.

94
00:07:25,212 --> 00:07:26,078
Mm...

95
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,221
I love this bit.

96
00:07:52,139 --> 00:07:53,072
Water!

97
00:07:54,408 --> 00:07:55,842
Get the water!

98
00:07:56,910 --> 00:07:59,479
Get the water! Water!

99
00:08:05,552 --> 00:08:08,589
Get ammo!
Get the fucking ammo!

100
00:08:12,659 --> 00:08:15,395
Quickly. Come on, move!

101
00:08:15,429 --> 00:08:17,331
Who the fuck
did these smokers?

102
00:08:21,735 --> 00:08:23,704
Stop fucking up!

103
00:08:25,439 --> 00:08:26,440
Come on! Come on!

104
00:08:31,378 --> 00:08:32,779
Put the fire out!

105
00:08:41,755 --> 00:08:43,824
Okay, on three.

106
00:08:43,857 --> 00:08:46,193
On three, or three,
two, one, go?

107
00:08:46,226 --> 00:08:47,494
Elijah, every time?

108
00:08:48,495 --> 00:08:49,463
It's funny. Every time.

109
00:08:49,496 --> 00:08:50,597
Come on.

110
00:08:50,631 --> 00:08:52,499
Three, two, one.

111
00:08:55,402 --> 00:08:57,337
- Shit!
- Shit!

112
00:08:57,371 --> 00:08:59,706
Wrong building.
There's nothing here.

113
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:02,643
What the fuck? Pata, this is not
how you fucking make amends.

114
00:09:02,676 --> 00:09:04,444
They told me
it's this building.

115
00:09:04,478 --> 00:09:05,612
What do you want us
to do, boss?

116
00:09:05,646 --> 00:09:06,880
It's gotta be
that one, right?

117
00:09:09,216 --> 00:09:10,951
It's gotta be.

118
00:09:10,984 --> 00:09:12,386
That's a lot
of open ground to clear.

119
00:09:13,887 --> 00:09:16,523
Rogue Two, I'm gonna need you
to draw their fire.

120
00:09:16,556 --> 00:09:19,459
- Send again, boss.
- <i>You got to piss them off so bad they shoot at you.</i>

121
00:09:19,493 --> 00:09:21,628
- <i>Copy?</i>
- Solid fucking copy.

122
00:09:21,662 --> 00:09:23,330
You know
this is stupid, right?

123
00:09:23,363 --> 00:09:25,465
Yeah. We do stupid
very well.

124
00:09:25,499 --> 00:09:26,900
Yes, we fucking do!

125
00:09:28,669 --> 00:09:29,536
What the fuck?

126
00:09:31,505 --> 00:09:33,306
Shit!

127
00:09:34,941 --> 00:09:36,376
What the fuck's going on?

128
00:09:36,410 --> 00:09:38,278
Give me the gun!
Give me the gun!

129
00:09:39,813 --> 00:09:41,214
Come here!

130
00:09:41,248 --> 00:09:42,282
Ding dong!

131
00:09:42,315 --> 00:09:43,583
- Fuck you!
- Moving!

132
00:09:44,718 --> 00:09:46,687
- It's very painful.
- Good.

133
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:48,488
<i>Boss,
this could get messy.</i>

134
00:09:48,522 --> 00:09:50,257
I like messy.

135
00:09:56,997 --> 00:09:58,799
<i>Yeah, we got 'em,
We got 'em up here, boss.</i>

136
00:10:01,501 --> 00:10:02,769
- On three.
- On three or three, two, one?

137
00:10:02,803 --> 00:10:04,805
- Elijah!
- Go!

138
00:10:08,942 --> 00:10:10,210
Clear!

139
00:10:11,745 --> 00:10:13,447
Clear!

140
00:10:15,415 --> 00:10:16,817
Put the fucking
guns down.

141
00:10:16,850 --> 00:10:17,951
Who's guarding the girls?

142
00:10:17,984 --> 00:10:20,921
Over here! Come here!

143
00:10:20,954 --> 00:10:22,823
You're fucking
missing them, man!

144
00:10:22,856 --> 00:10:24,257
- Shoot him!
- Cover me!

145
00:10:24,291 --> 00:10:25,292
Moving, moving!

146
00:10:29,763 --> 00:10:32,032
Shoot him!

147
00:10:32,065 --> 00:10:33,633
Shoot
the bad guys!

148
00:10:33,667 --> 00:10:35,869
Shoot them
so I don't have to!

149
00:10:38,972 --> 00:10:40,006
Fuck!

150
00:10:41,708 --> 00:10:43,844
- Over here!
- Over... Hey!

151
00:10:45,846 --> 00:10:47,581
You wanna take
what's mine, yeah?

152
00:10:48,949 --> 00:10:51,485
Hey! Hey! Over here!

153
00:10:51,518 --> 00:10:52,953
Well, we'll see about that.

154
00:10:58,091 --> 00:10:59,960
- Yes!
- Fuck, what is this?

155
00:10:59,993 --> 00:11:01,394
They're trafficking girls.

156
00:11:01,428 --> 00:11:02,763
Please! Please!
Please! Please!

157
00:11:02,796 --> 00:11:04,064
We'll help you,
don't worry.

158
00:11:04,097 --> 00:11:05,565
Open the door!
You can open the door!

159
00:11:05,599 --> 00:11:07,667
- You can open the door! Please!
- No, not you.

160
00:11:09,369 --> 00:11:11,605
Hey, girl! Girl!

161
00:11:11,638 --> 00:11:12,672
What's your name?

162
00:11:12,706 --> 00:11:14,908
Asilia Wilson.

163
00:11:14,941 --> 00:11:16,409
Bingo! She's the money.

164
00:11:20,413 --> 00:11:22,015
Light them up, boys!

165
00:11:31,992 --> 00:11:33,760
No, get back!

166
00:11:33,794 --> 00:11:35,929
- Get down! Secure her.
- She said don't move.

167
00:11:35,962 --> 00:11:38,565
Rogue One to Rogue Three,
we're ready for extraction.

168
00:11:38,598 --> 00:11:39,599
Copy you. Inbound.

169
00:11:41,668 --> 00:11:43,436
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
What about the others?

170
00:11:43,470 --> 00:11:45,539
- They're not part of the plan.
- Sam!

171
00:11:45,572 --> 00:11:47,541
You just said we gotta move.
That'll just slow us down.

172
00:11:47,574 --> 00:11:48,775
We don't have room
in the vehicles.

173
00:11:48,809 --> 00:11:50,443
- Rogue One for Rogue Three.
- Sam!

174
00:11:50,477 --> 00:11:53,079
Hey! Fucking don't make me
pull rank on you, Eli!

175
00:11:53,114 --> 00:11:54,981
This is not about rank.

176
00:11:55,015 --> 00:11:56,950
We didn't fucking plan for this!
We're not getting paid for this!

177
00:11:56,983 --> 00:11:58,351
- Come on!
- Sam!

178
00:11:58,385 --> 00:11:59,753
We're not getting
paid for this.

179
00:11:59,786 --> 00:12:01,454
Please, somebody!
Just help me! Please!

180
00:12:01,488 --> 00:12:03,590
What the fuck?!

181
00:12:03,623 --> 00:12:07,527
Please! Please! Please!
Please! I'm begging you!

182
00:12:07,561 --> 00:12:10,363
If I fucking die because I'm doing the
right thing, I'm gonna be so pissed.

183
00:12:10,397 --> 00:12:12,332
Fuck it, do it!

184
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:21,142
Light 'em up!

185
00:12:21,175 --> 00:12:23,043
- Get me a motor car!
- Hey, over here!

186
00:12:25,512 --> 00:12:27,848
When you want them to shoot,
they don't shoot.

187
00:12:29,883 --> 00:12:30,917
Go! Go!

188
00:12:31,918 --> 00:12:33,954
Burn these fuckers up! Go!

189
00:12:33,987 --> 00:12:37,057
Burn these fuckers to death!
Get in there!

190
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:42,596
Well, we ain't leaving
this fucking way!

191
00:12:42,629 --> 00:12:43,997
We need a back door!

192
00:12:44,030 --> 00:12:47,168
Everybody duck!
Pull back! Stay down!

193
00:12:47,201 --> 00:12:49,069
They set
the building on fire!

194
00:12:49,103 --> 00:12:50,904
They're fuckin' holding.
Sit down!

195
00:12:52,206 --> 00:12:53,907
Sixty seconds out.
Where are you?

196
00:12:55,809 --> 00:12:57,444
We're fucked! We're fucked!
We're all gonna burn!

197
00:12:57,477 --> 00:12:59,079
What kind of rescue is this?

198
00:12:59,113 --> 00:13:01,681
Nobody fucking sent anybody
to rescue you.

199
00:13:02,949 --> 00:13:05,152
Seconds away.
Where do you want us?

200
00:13:05,186 --> 00:13:09,422
Second building.
Low bungalow, south side. Back door.

201
00:13:09,456 --> 00:13:11,625
There's no back door
in building two!

202
00:13:11,658 --> 00:13:12,826
There will be.

203
00:13:14,794 --> 00:13:16,197
- Move!
- Listen to me, come here!

204
00:13:16,230 --> 00:13:18,199
Come here, now!

205
00:13:18,232 --> 00:13:20,000
Shh, it's gonna
be okay. All right?

206
00:13:20,033 --> 00:13:21,868
I want you to cover your ears
and open your mouth.

207
00:13:21,902 --> 00:13:24,205
- What? Why? Why?
- Hey! Unless you wanna blow out your lungs

208
00:13:24,238 --> 00:13:26,773
and your fucking eardrums,
you're gonna do what I say.

209
00:13:26,806 --> 00:13:27,941
You're gonna
blow up the room?

210
00:13:27,974 --> 00:13:30,510
No, just the wall. Get down.

211
00:13:31,611 --> 00:13:32,946
Fire in the hole!

212
00:13:41,188 --> 00:13:42,656
Go around the back!

213
00:13:42,689 --> 00:13:43,990
Around the back!

214
00:13:45,525 --> 00:13:47,060
Come on! Hurry, hurry!
Get in, get in!

215
00:13:47,093 --> 00:13:49,496
I thought
there was only one hostage!

216
00:13:49,529 --> 00:13:52,599
It's an evolving situation.
Come on! Let's go, go, go!

217
00:13:52,632 --> 00:13:56,203
- How many we got?
- It's a "rescue one, get three" kinda deal.

218
00:13:56,237 --> 00:13:57,704
Let's get
the fuck outta here!

219
00:13:57,737 --> 00:13:59,240
Go, go, Bobbie!
Go, go, go, go, go!

220
00:13:59,273 --> 00:14:02,709
Hey! You, man. Come!

221
00:14:02,742 --> 00:14:04,044
Go get the truck!

222
00:14:05,712 --> 00:14:07,747
Come on!
Let's go, let's go!

223
00:14:07,781 --> 00:14:09,849
Don't go, my legs
are shorter than you!

224
00:14:16,856 --> 00:14:19,859
Let's go! Let's go!
Open that fucking gate!

225
00:14:21,295 --> 00:14:23,496
- Come on!
- Get in! Get in! Get in!

226
00:14:23,530 --> 00:14:25,031
Light 'em up!

227
00:14:35,976 --> 00:14:37,510
Someone order an Uber?

228
00:14:40,314 --> 00:14:41,948
- Too soon?
- Yeah.

229
00:14:41,982 --> 00:14:43,650
Rogue One for Osprey. Over.

230
00:14:43,683 --> 00:14:45,085
<i>Go for Osprey. Sitrep.</i>

231
00:14:45,119 --> 00:14:46,786
We've got
the package plus two,

232
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:48,521
and we're three minutes
from the extraction point.

233
00:14:48,555 --> 00:14:50,191
I repeat, three minutes. Over.

234
00:14:50,224 --> 00:14:51,791
<i>Unit copy.
Three minutes to extraction.</i>

235
00:14:56,197 --> 00:14:58,031
Boss! Theyre sending more!

236
00:14:58,064 --> 00:15:00,301
- We need to lose these guys!
- I'm on it! I'm on it!

237
00:15:00,334 --> 00:15:01,202
Hold on!

238
00:15:08,875 --> 00:15:09,876
Take stuff from me, eh?

239
00:15:14,215 --> 00:15:16,049
Company, company, company!

240
00:15:17,050 --> 00:15:18,752
I'm coming for you!

241
00:15:18,785 --> 00:15:20,653
They're shooting on the left!

242
00:15:25,825 --> 00:15:27,027
Come on!

243
00:15:29,596 --> 00:15:31,097
I got Osprey!

244
00:15:31,132 --> 00:15:33,134
- Chopper's up! Chopper's up!
- Yes!

245
00:15:36,370 --> 00:15:38,272
Give me the RPG!
Quick! Quick!

246
00:15:38,305 --> 00:15:39,806
Give me the RPG!

247
00:15:40,907 --> 00:15:41,841
Give me it!

248
00:15:43,210 --> 00:15:44,077
Fuck!

249
00:15:46,813 --> 00:15:48,748
- RPG!
- Take him out! Take him out!

250
00:15:48,782 --> 00:15:50,550
I've got him! I've got him!

251
00:15:52,153 --> 00:15:53,320
I don't got him!

252
00:15:53,354 --> 00:15:54,921
Oh... Shit!

253
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:56,157
- No, no, no, no, no!
- Osprey! RPG fired!

254
00:15:56,190 --> 00:15:57,957
Pull up!
Pull up, Osprey!

255
00:16:06,699 --> 00:16:09,203
Fuck! Fuck!

256
00:16:10,937 --> 00:16:12,273
Fuck you!

257
00:16:20,214 --> 00:16:22,316
Open fire, open fire!
To the left! To the left!

258
00:16:22,349 --> 00:16:23,317
Stick with me.

259
00:16:24,818 --> 00:16:25,885
Don't worry.
It's not that bad.

260
00:16:25,919 --> 00:16:26,753
It's gonna be...

261
00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:34,761
Let me see.
Oh, yeah, they shot him.

262
00:16:41,302 --> 00:16:44,238
Joey! Calm her
the fuck down!

263
00:16:44,271 --> 00:16:46,739
- Hey! What's your name?
- Chloe.

264
00:16:46,773 --> 00:16:48,842
Chloe? Chloe,
that's a beautiful name.

265
00:16:48,875 --> 00:16:50,411
Now look, I know you're scared,
and I know you're frightened,

266
00:16:50,444 --> 00:16:51,845
but you need to calm down
for all of us.

267
00:16:51,878 --> 00:16:53,280
The cavalry's, uh...

268
00:16:53,314 --> 00:16:54,781
Well, the cavalry's
gonna come back.

269
00:16:55,782 --> 00:16:56,816
Shut up.

270
00:17:02,822 --> 00:17:04,090
Bobbie!

271
00:17:05,758 --> 00:17:07,927
Elijah! Take over!

272
00:17:07,961 --> 00:17:10,331
- Fuck!
- Hometown advantage! I got this!

273
00:17:10,364 --> 00:17:12,999
Keep firing!
Just keep them off us!

274
00:17:16,237 --> 00:17:18,172
Keep firing!

275
00:17:21,708 --> 00:17:22,842
Grenade out!

276
00:17:28,781 --> 00:17:29,849
Grenade out!

277
00:17:32,319 --> 00:17:34,087
Grenade out!

278
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:42,662
- Joey, grenade! It's hot.
- Thank you.

279
00:17:43,897 --> 00:17:45,232
See you later, assholes!

280
00:17:50,237 --> 00:17:53,140
These wheels
are done. Fuck!

281
00:17:53,174 --> 00:17:54,841
All right,
we gotta move.

282
00:17:54,874 --> 00:17:56,443
- Out! Out! Out!
- Move, move, move!

283
00:18:00,847 --> 00:18:01,948
Come with me. Come with me.

284
00:18:09,223 --> 00:18:11,024
Cover me!

285
00:18:11,057 --> 00:18:16,029
- Moving!
- Move! Covering! Covering!

286
00:18:16,062 --> 00:18:17,298
Michael, you good?

287
00:18:18,865 --> 00:18:21,468
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Down! Down, down.

288
00:18:21,502 --> 00:18:23,304
Ah, shit!

289
00:18:23,337 --> 00:18:25,939
It's hot.

290
00:18:25,972 --> 00:18:27,408
- Incoming!
- We got to jump.

291
00:18:27,441 --> 00:18:29,042
Looks good to me.

292
00:18:29,075 --> 00:18:31,245
Move! We're gonna
have to jump.

293
00:18:31,278 --> 00:18:33,046
What? No, we can't!
No, we can't!

294
00:18:33,079 --> 00:18:34,747
It's not deep enough.

295
00:18:36,183 --> 00:18:37,451
It's deep enough.

296
00:18:37,484 --> 00:18:38,985
Oh, my God!
That's no way of telling!

297
00:18:39,018 --> 00:18:40,820
Hey! Do you want to take
a fucking stand here?

298
00:18:40,853 --> 00:18:42,055
Because we're gonna die.

299
00:18:42,088 --> 00:18:43,856
Bo, you good?

300
00:18:43,890 --> 00:18:45,392
- I'm running...
- Change!

301
00:18:50,531 --> 00:18:52,533
Come on, come on, come on.

302
00:18:52,566 --> 00:18:53,534
There you go.

303
00:18:57,971 --> 00:18:58,972
We can't!

304
00:19:02,576 --> 00:19:05,145
This is my last one!
We need a plan!

305
00:19:05,179 --> 00:19:08,148
Hey, boss!
What's the plan?

306
00:19:10,083 --> 00:19:11,818
- Fuck.
- Sam, what are we doing?

307
00:19:11,851 --> 00:19:14,488
- What are we doing?
- Take out your plates.

308
00:19:14,521 --> 00:19:16,290
- Get rid of your longs.
- Keep it down! Keep it down!

309
00:19:16,323 --> 00:19:17,790
Anything that's gonna
drag you down.

310
00:19:17,824 --> 00:19:20,294
- We have to jump!
- There's no way!

311
00:19:20,327 --> 00:19:23,029
We're losing our longs?
Losing our armor?

312
00:19:23,062 --> 00:19:24,431
She's fucking this up!

313
00:19:24,465 --> 00:19:26,533
Hey, you know, we stay here,
we're gonna die, right?

314
00:19:26,567 --> 00:19:28,569
We can't jump!
Please, please, please!

315
00:19:28,602 --> 00:19:31,070
You think we wanna die
from jumpin' off a cliff?

316
00:19:31,105 --> 00:19:33,906
- Fucking nuts!
- I'm not gettin' paid enough for this shit!

317
00:19:33,940 --> 00:19:36,876
Killing bad guys is one thing,
losing that shit...

318
00:19:38,077 --> 00:19:39,413
Listen to me...

319
00:19:39,446 --> 00:19:41,080
- I can't swim.
- Hey, hey, you can do

320
00:19:41,115 --> 00:19:42,316
anything that you need
to do to survive.

321
00:19:42,349 --> 00:19:43,484
You've already
survived this far.

322
00:19:43,517 --> 00:19:45,252
Look at this. This jump?
It's nothing.

323
00:19:45,286 --> 00:19:46,953
It's nothing, it's just air.

324
00:19:46,986 --> 00:19:49,156
That river, it's nothing.
It's just water.

325
00:19:49,189 --> 00:19:50,890
You can do this,
we're gonna be okay.

326
00:19:52,426 --> 00:19:54,093
I'm out!

327
00:19:59,966 --> 00:20:01,168
Masakh.

328
00:20:02,935 --> 00:20:04,837
Masakh!

329
00:20:06,140 --> 00:20:08,442
What are
you doing? Get down!

330
00:20:08,475 --> 00:20:11,878
Get down!

331
00:20:11,911 --> 00:20:13,180
Not here, my friend.

332
00:20:13,213 --> 00:20:15,048
That man,
he needs to die!

333
00:20:17,117 --> 00:20:19,486
- Take your revenge another time.
- We've got to move!

334
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:21,087
- Pata, now, move!
- Listen to me...

335
00:20:21,121 --> 00:20:22,122
- Move!
- Let's go!

336
00:20:22,156 --> 00:20:23,157
- Okay.
- Okay?

337
00:20:23,190 --> 00:20:25,359
Pata! Let's move!

338
00:20:25,392 --> 00:20:26,993
Go, go, go, go, go!

339
00:20:31,097 --> 00:20:33,966
We gotta go.
We gotta move. Move!

340
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:38,405
Anyone want to go for a swim?
Get your bikini! Go! Go!

341
00:20:42,309 --> 00:20:43,310
No, no, no!
We're gonna die!

342
00:20:47,114 --> 00:20:49,048
Look at me. Look at me.
Look at me. It's gonna be fine.

343
00:20:49,082 --> 00:20:50,117
Come on. Trust me.

344
00:20:50,150 --> 00:20:51,585
Trust me!

345
00:20:56,657 --> 00:20:59,560
You ready? On me. Move!

346
00:20:59,593 --> 00:21:01,161
Go! Let's go!

347
00:21:03,630 --> 00:21:05,666
TJ! No! Dammit!

348
00:21:05,699 --> 00:21:08,268
Shit. Get her. Come here.
Get her, get her, get her.

349
00:21:12,373 --> 00:21:14,274
Hey, hey,
pressure on the wound.

350
00:21:14,308 --> 00:21:15,542
TJ, put pressure
on the wound.

351
00:21:17,111 --> 00:21:18,312
Bo, I'm out!

352
00:21:18,345 --> 00:21:19,646
Go!

353
00:21:24,151 --> 00:21:26,120
- I'm done.
- No. No!

354
00:21:26,153 --> 00:21:28,222
- Just go!
- You know what they're gonna do to a woman.

355
00:21:28,255 --> 00:21:31,625
I'll cover you. Don't worry,
I'll be dead before they get me.

356
00:21:34,695 --> 00:21:36,430
- Moving!
- Let's swim!

357
00:21:38,632 --> 00:21:39,999
I'm covering!

358
00:21:42,569 --> 00:21:44,036
Shit!

359
00:22:09,296 --> 00:22:11,665
Where are the girls?

360
00:22:19,005 --> 00:22:20,474
Where are the girls?

361
00:22:39,526 --> 00:22:41,662
I've got you. I've got you.
I've got you.

362
00:22:53,106 --> 00:22:55,007
Shit!

363
00:23:11,658 --> 00:23:13,293
Come on.

364
00:23:23,537 --> 00:23:25,071
- Hold on!
- Grab me by the hand!

365
00:23:25,105 --> 00:23:26,440
- Come on. Grab!
- Grab her!

366
00:23:27,841 --> 00:23:29,543
- I got you.
- Head count, head count!

367
00:23:29,576 --> 00:23:31,378
Grab my hand! Grab my hand!

368
00:23:31,411 --> 00:23:32,779
Are you okay, bruv?

369
00:23:33,847 --> 00:23:36,048
God, I'm so cold!

370
00:23:36,082 --> 00:23:38,118
Come on,
you gotta get up.

371
00:23:40,487 --> 00:23:42,456
Come on. Come on.

372
00:23:47,427 --> 00:23:50,831
We gotta go.
We didn't move that far.

373
00:23:50,864 --> 00:23:52,432
- Come on, you're there.
- Come on!

374
00:23:52,466 --> 00:23:54,201
We gotta keep moving.
We gotta keep moving.

375
00:23:54,234 --> 00:23:56,503
- There you go, buddy.
- Come on.

376
00:23:56,537 --> 00:23:59,172
- Good.
- Come on. Go.

377
00:23:59,206 --> 00:24:02,276
We gotta keep moving,
come on. Let's go.

378
00:24:02,309 --> 00:24:06,045
- Stick together!
- Barasa, on your feet.

379
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:29,336
Let's keep heading
down the river. Two clicks.

380
00:24:29,369 --> 00:24:31,505
And you're still
in command?

381
00:24:35,642 --> 00:24:38,111
Yeah, you better
fucking believe that I am.

382
00:24:38,145 --> 00:24:40,147
Even after
your fucking mess?

383
00:24:40,180 --> 00:24:41,481
We'll see how much
longer that lasts.

384
00:24:41,515 --> 00:24:44,151
Hey, hey. Another word
out of your mouth,

385
00:24:44,184 --> 00:24:45,652
and we've got a problem.

386
00:24:48,255 --> 00:24:50,724
We've already
got a fucking problem!

387
00:25:01,735 --> 00:25:06,273
We need to rest.
We need a break. Please!

388
00:25:06,306 --> 00:25:09,409
- Please, we need a fucking break!
- Come on.

389
00:25:09,443 --> 00:25:11,912
- We need to rest. I can't do it.
- Take my hand.

390
00:25:11,945 --> 00:25:14,748
You don't know
what we've been through!

391
00:25:14,781 --> 00:25:16,550
- There could be anything in there!
- Get in the fucking water!

392
00:25:16,583 --> 00:25:18,485
I'm not getting
in the fucking water!

393
00:25:18,518 --> 00:25:21,388
If you don't get in the water,
you're gonna fucking die!

394
00:25:34,368 --> 00:25:35,569
You're wasting your ammo!
Stop it!

395
00:25:36,870 --> 00:25:38,905
- Stop! Stop!
- Stop!

396
00:25:38,939 --> 00:25:40,841
Everybody, move back!
Move, move!

397
00:25:40,874 --> 00:25:45,479
We need to move back.
There might be a new animal.

398
00:25:46,647 --> 00:25:48,515
We have to do
something, Sam.

399
00:25:48,548 --> 00:25:52,285
She's dead.
You're wasting ammo.

400
00:25:52,319 --> 00:25:56,156
Mike, Mike...
they're gonna hear us.

401
00:25:57,591 --> 00:25:58,625
Come on.

402
00:26:00,327 --> 00:26:01,595
Move out!

403
00:26:29,923 --> 00:26:31,525
Zalaam!

404
00:26:31,558 --> 00:26:35,362
Brother, help me!

405
00:26:38,965 --> 00:26:40,867
You're dying,
my brother.

406
00:26:40,901 --> 00:26:42,502
No...

407
00:26:42,536 --> 00:26:46,540
Yes. It's okay.

408
00:26:46,573 --> 00:26:48,408
This is your time.

409
00:26:50,410 --> 00:26:54,614
Do you remember
Hillah? Huh?

410
00:26:54,648 --> 00:26:58,685
And all our brothers that were
slaughtered at that day? Huh?

411
00:26:58,719 --> 00:27:00,587
Do you remember
the ground?

412
00:27:00,620 --> 00:27:03,356
It was covered
in blood, huh?

413
00:27:03,390 --> 00:27:07,360
And we'd say, it's as if the
Earth was somehow crying for them.

414
00:27:07,394 --> 00:27:08,595
Do you remember that?

415
00:27:08,628 --> 00:27:12,332
For they wasn't
crying out of sadness.

416
00:27:12,365 --> 00:27:15,001
They were crying out of joy.

417
00:27:15,035 --> 00:27:19,639
They are the lucky ones.

418
00:27:19,673 --> 00:27:24,411
They are the chosen ones...
to have died that day.

419
00:27:25,746 --> 00:27:29,750
And now... you are
the chosen one now.

420
00:27:30,751 --> 00:27:33,019
I love you, my brother.

421
00:27:33,053 --> 00:27:34,554
But no more suffering.

422
00:27:51,872 --> 00:27:53,707
- Yeah.
- Easy, easy, easy.

423
00:27:59,613 --> 00:28:02,783
- Looks like a guard post.
- Guarding what?

424
00:28:05,018 --> 00:28:07,053
Here, you guys
sit down.

425
00:28:14,995 --> 00:28:16,396
Guys, we got
buildings up there.

426
00:28:16,429 --> 00:28:17,597
Why don't you two
go check it out?

427
00:28:17,631 --> 00:28:19,800
Oh, yippie!

428
00:28:21,102 --> 00:28:23,470
All right, me and you, Bo.
Let's go.

429
00:28:25,806 --> 00:28:29,042
It's going to be
a poacher's moon tonight.

430
00:28:29,075 --> 00:28:31,745
Bad for us.

431
00:28:31,778 --> 00:28:32,946
Why is that?

432
00:28:32,979 --> 00:28:34,548
It's a full moon,
my friend.

433
00:28:36,117 --> 00:28:38,952
Abundant light in the night.

434
00:28:38,985 --> 00:28:42,722
Therefore, we are easy to see,
easy to hunt.

435
00:28:42,756 --> 00:28:45,759
Hunt? Really?

436
00:28:45,792 --> 00:28:48,461
You think Zalaam is gonna
give up so easily?

437
00:28:49,963 --> 00:28:52,098
She's the governor's
daughter.

438
00:28:54,434 --> 00:28:55,936
With her in his hand,

439
00:28:55,969 --> 00:28:58,105
Zalaam is wielding
much power.

440
00:28:59,573 --> 00:29:01,142
And he will not stop
until he has

441
00:29:01,175 --> 00:29:03,076
the entire government
on their knees...

442
00:29:03,110 --> 00:29:05,445
Hey, Pata, bro.

443
00:29:06,446 --> 00:29:08,348
That's enough.

444
00:29:09,649 --> 00:29:10,884
That's enough.

445
00:29:14,921 --> 00:29:17,958
I'm sorry. No, we are well,
going to be safe here.

446
00:29:38,578 --> 00:29:41,014
Hey,
this is the last time.

447
00:29:41,047 --> 00:29:42,816
Last time you said,
"This was the last time."

448
00:29:42,849 --> 00:29:44,651
Yeah, but this time,
it's really the last time.

449
00:29:44,684 --> 00:29:47,888
- Mm.
- That was a shit sandwich back there.

450
00:29:47,921 --> 00:29:49,789
Tell me you don't think
she fucked up, huh?

451
00:29:49,823 --> 00:29:51,992
The plan was to rescue one girl.
We rescue three.

452
00:29:52,025 --> 00:29:54,527
Different plan.
Different outcome.

453
00:29:56,997 --> 00:29:58,098
Yeah.

454
00:30:11,112 --> 00:30:12,879
I wonder
what this place is.

455
00:30:12,913 --> 00:30:14,148
Looks like a farm.

456
00:30:14,181 --> 00:30:15,415
What do you think
they kept here?

457
00:30:16,516 --> 00:30:17,550
I don't know.

458
00:30:18,985 --> 00:30:20,154
Let me know
when you got an opinion.

459
00:30:20,187 --> 00:30:21,922
Yeah, you'll be
the first to know.

460
00:30:21,955 --> 00:30:23,790
This looks like home.

461
00:30:23,823 --> 00:30:24,691
Yeah.

462
00:30:25,859 --> 00:30:27,961
- Let's knock.
- Yeah.

463
00:30:58,292 --> 00:31:00,794
- Clear.
- Yeah, it's good.

464
00:31:01,795 --> 00:31:02,862
Well done.

465
00:31:04,864 --> 00:31:06,032
You got a "well done."

466
00:31:06,066 --> 00:31:08,001
Shouldn't we ask...

467
00:31:08,034 --> 00:31:10,503
Sit there.

468
00:31:10,537 --> 00:31:12,739
Shouldn't we ask
the owner's permission?

469
00:31:12,772 --> 00:31:14,641
We looked.
No one here.

470
00:31:14,674 --> 00:31:16,009
Finders keepers,
right? Mm.

471
00:31:16,042 --> 00:31:17,577
Where do you think
they went?

472
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:22,082
We're gonna find out.
Eli, you good?

473
00:31:22,116 --> 00:31:24,651
- Always.
- You guys get cleaned up.

474
00:31:24,684 --> 00:31:26,653
Joey, take care of that.

475
00:31:26,686 --> 00:31:28,755
The shit just hit the fan.

476
00:31:28,788 --> 00:31:30,023
Good time
to go sober.

477
00:31:31,091 --> 00:31:32,959
Never a good time.

478
00:31:32,993 --> 00:31:35,595
Pata, Barasa, I want you on watch.
Keep on comms.

479
00:31:36,596 --> 00:31:38,265
Copy you.

480
00:31:38,299 --> 00:31:43,137
Wait, wait. So we just wait
here until they come again?

481
00:31:43,170 --> 00:31:46,207
We're far ahead. They're not
gonna be able to track us.

482
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:47,941
We're gonna find a way
to call for help.

483
00:31:47,974 --> 00:31:50,744
- What about the sat phone?
- It's fucked.

484
00:31:50,777 --> 00:31:53,214
Bullet went
right through it.

485
00:31:53,247 --> 00:31:56,049
I guess they don't make these
762 proof.

486
00:31:56,082 --> 00:31:58,018
You got the receipt?

487
00:31:58,051 --> 00:31:59,919
Well, don't you guys
have radios?

488
00:31:59,953 --> 00:32:01,755
Just for us.
Not enough range.

489
00:32:01,788 --> 00:32:03,623
Oh, okay.

490
00:32:03,656 --> 00:32:05,992
Don't worry.
We got this.

491
00:32:09,863 --> 00:32:11,931
You guys get some rest.
You two, on me.

492
00:32:13,167 --> 00:32:15,602
Oh, shit.

493
00:32:17,271 --> 00:32:19,106
Fucking things.

494
00:32:20,607 --> 00:32:21,975
Waterlogged.

495
00:32:22,008 --> 00:32:23,977
Any one of you
got a ball of rice?

496
00:32:24,010 --> 00:32:25,678
Don't look at me, huh?

497
00:32:28,848 --> 00:32:30,050
Chinaman.

498
00:32:47,967 --> 00:32:49,069
You okay?

499
00:32:49,103 --> 00:32:51,638
Yeah. Are you?

500
00:32:51,671 --> 00:32:54,241
- Yeah.
- Good.

501
00:32:54,275 --> 00:32:56,943
You two check the perimeter.
If you hear or see anything, check in.

502
00:32:56,976 --> 00:32:58,812
Copy you.

503
00:32:58,845 --> 00:33:00,780
Radio check.

504
00:33:00,814 --> 00:33:01,948
Good check.

505
00:33:01,981 --> 00:33:03,049
Good check.

506
00:33:13,693 --> 00:33:17,063
Thanks, Joey.

507
00:33:17,097 --> 00:33:19,032
- Can you grab my med kit?
- Yeah.

508
00:33:20,700 --> 00:33:22,602
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

509
00:33:25,839 --> 00:33:27,974
Ooh. Who's hungry?

510
00:33:28,007 --> 00:33:29,110
I am.

511
00:33:29,143 --> 00:33:30,944
What is it?

512
00:33:30,977 --> 00:33:32,779
Energy bar.

513
00:33:32,812 --> 00:33:35,382
Oh, okay.
Better than nothing.

514
00:33:36,716 --> 00:33:38,219
Don't eat
all at once, huh?

515
00:33:39,286 --> 00:33:42,289
Okay, slowly,
slowly.

516
00:33:42,323 --> 00:33:43,290
Joey.

517
00:33:43,324 --> 00:33:44,325
Hey, thanks, brother.

518
00:33:45,825 --> 00:33:47,228
It's so good, but so gross.

519
00:33:47,261 --> 00:33:48,262
- Oh, yeah.
- Mm-mm.

520
00:33:48,295 --> 00:33:50,096
Like cup noodles. Mmm.

521
00:33:51,798 --> 00:33:53,334
Can I help you?

522
00:33:53,367 --> 00:33:55,102
It's not the first time.

523
00:33:56,403 --> 00:33:57,971
What, that you've been shot?

524
00:33:58,004 --> 00:34:00,707
Yeah, shot,
stabbed, beaten.

525
00:34:00,740 --> 00:34:02,976
And that was before he
joined the Marines.

526
00:34:05,011 --> 00:34:06,045
No, it's right there.

527
00:34:09,150 --> 00:34:13,786
So why is she in charge?
Sam, or whatever her name is?

528
00:34:13,820 --> 00:34:18,392
Oh... You should ask her.

529
00:34:18,425 --> 00:34:20,026
Her dad's the governor.
He employed her.

530
00:34:21,928 --> 00:34:23,930
And so she employs you guys?

531
00:34:23,963 --> 00:34:26,065
Yeah. It's okay, I got it.
I got it.

532
00:34:27,334 --> 00:34:29,236
So you're just in this
for the money.

533
00:34:29,270 --> 00:34:30,837
What, you want me
to fight for free?

534
00:34:32,071 --> 00:34:33,973
Why not? Zealots
and believers do.

535
00:34:34,007 --> 00:34:36,410
And ain't they
just the loveliest people.

536
00:34:36,443 --> 00:34:39,078
So if she didn't pay you,

537
00:34:39,113 --> 00:34:41,848
we'd still be
in those fucking cages?

538
00:34:41,881 --> 00:34:44,083
Tessa, they're trying
to help us.

539
00:34:44,118 --> 00:34:45,286
I know.

540
00:34:45,319 --> 00:34:47,354
I mean, this is
just a job to them.

541
00:34:47,388 --> 00:34:50,324
She's just a boss, and they
don't even fucking like her.

542
00:34:50,357 --> 00:34:53,260
Who likes their boss,
huh?

543
00:34:53,294 --> 00:34:56,463
Yeah, but you don't think
that she can do this, do you?

544
00:35:01,168 --> 00:35:03,703
- I just think that...
- Is she good?

545
00:35:06,906 --> 00:35:08,875
Yeah, yeah.

546
00:35:08,908 --> 00:35:12,179
Yeah, she's good.
She's been in The Suck,

547
00:35:12,213 --> 00:35:15,149
and she's been in some gnarly
places, and she came out forged hard.

548
00:35:16,383 --> 00:35:18,485
Maybe too hard.

549
00:35:18,519 --> 00:35:22,122
But she will...
get us out of here?

550
00:35:53,953 --> 00:35:55,054
Yes.

551
00:36:02,229 --> 00:36:05,232
Fuck. There's no power.

552
00:36:06,966 --> 00:36:09,002
The whole camp
doesn't have power.

553
00:36:09,035 --> 00:36:10,237
The generator must be off.

554
00:36:17,311 --> 00:36:20,013
Okay, we find the gennie,
get it started,

555
00:36:20,046 --> 00:36:23,550
and get this kit back online.
Call for an extraction.

556
00:36:23,584 --> 00:36:25,119
That sounds like a plan...

557
00:36:26,253 --> 00:36:28,289
if we can find the generator.

558
00:36:31,858 --> 00:36:33,860
Huh,
back in business, bruv.

559
00:36:35,195 --> 00:36:36,397
Fuckin' wonder
where everyone went.

560
00:36:38,299 --> 00:36:41,834
There are many abandoned farms
and villages here.

561
00:36:41,868 --> 00:36:45,038
So, when Al-Shabaab came,
many people ran away.

562
00:36:45,071 --> 00:36:46,939
Others were killed.

563
00:36:46,973 --> 00:36:49,008
So you're from here?

564
00:36:49,042 --> 00:36:52,446
I am Maasai, yes.
So this whole area was my home.

565
00:36:53,946 --> 00:36:55,349
When did you move?

566
00:36:55,382 --> 00:36:58,585
I didn't. I stayed.

567
00:37:03,123 --> 00:37:04,325
You're actually saying
you joined them.

568
00:37:04,358 --> 00:37:06,025
I stayed.

569
00:37:06,059 --> 00:37:07,561
I believed everything
the imam was saying.

570
00:37:07,594 --> 00:37:09,962
I was a young person. What?

571
00:37:09,996 --> 00:37:13,233
That's why you knew that big
tosser back at the cliff.

572
00:37:13,267 --> 00:37:15,034
Masakh.

573
00:37:15,068 --> 00:37:16,403
You see, that man...

574
00:37:16,437 --> 00:37:19,273
I'm telling you, one day,
I will kill him.

575
00:37:19,306 --> 00:37:22,309
For all of my sins and his.

576
00:37:22,343 --> 00:37:26,913
We've all done bad things, bruv.
That's how we end up here.

577
00:37:42,696 --> 00:37:44,964
What do you think dug this?

578
00:37:44,997 --> 00:37:46,567
It's big rats.

579
00:37:49,068 --> 00:37:51,205
Big, big, big rats.

580
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:09,590
Mm... Look at this mess.

581
00:38:14,060 --> 00:38:16,630
Blood in the backyard, too.
What do you think?

582
00:38:16,663 --> 00:38:19,166
Looks like the driver
was cut up and dragged out.

583
00:38:19,199 --> 00:38:20,933
Yeah, it looks like it.

584
00:38:22,569 --> 00:38:25,004
This one's left running.

585
00:38:25,037 --> 00:38:27,107
Looks like they were trying
to get away when they were hit.

586
00:38:28,175 --> 00:38:29,376
By what?

587
00:38:29,410 --> 00:38:31,412
I don't know. Big rats.

588
00:38:33,714 --> 00:38:37,950
This place just...
feels wrong.

589
00:38:39,219 --> 00:38:42,256
Are we doing
feelings now?

590
00:38:42,289 --> 00:38:44,591
Yeah, I got feelings.

591
00:38:44,625 --> 00:38:46,993
I know you do.

592
00:38:47,026 --> 00:38:48,961
What I'm saying is that I
don't think it's a bad idea

593
00:38:48,995 --> 00:38:52,031
if you just show it, you know,
just-just every now and then.

594
00:38:52,064 --> 00:38:55,135
Oh, yeah? What good
is that gonna do?

595
00:38:55,169 --> 00:38:56,303
Makes you human, Sam.

596
00:38:56,336 --> 00:38:58,172
It'll help you
keep your team in line.

597
00:38:58,205 --> 00:39:00,474
My team is getting paid
to be in line.

598
00:39:01,675 --> 00:39:03,677
Not the ones
that don't make it home.

599
00:39:08,182 --> 00:39:09,982
Hey, Sam.

600
00:39:11,251 --> 00:39:14,288
I've got your back.
Always.

601
00:39:19,159 --> 00:39:20,294
On three.

602
00:39:23,263 --> 00:39:24,131
Three.

603
00:39:31,371 --> 00:39:34,408
What the fuck is this?

604
00:39:34,441 --> 00:39:36,976
It's what I thought...
A lion farm.

605
00:39:38,044 --> 00:39:39,346
Poachers' stronghold.

606
00:39:39,379 --> 00:39:43,015
A lion farm?
Why would you farm lions?

607
00:39:43,049 --> 00:39:44,551
You can't eat 'em.

608
00:39:44,585 --> 00:39:47,287
Oh, their skins...

609
00:39:47,321 --> 00:39:49,656
and these bones crushed up,

610
00:39:49,690 --> 00:39:51,492
it's worth a lot of money
in the East.

611
00:39:53,227 --> 00:39:55,061
- Fuckers.
- I thought that was tigers.

612
00:39:56,630 --> 00:39:59,199
Tigers started becoming rare,
so they turned to lions.

613
00:39:59,233 --> 00:40:00,767
Now the lions
are becoming rare.

614
00:40:02,769 --> 00:40:05,539
The difference is that they
breed really well in captivity.

615
00:40:05,572 --> 00:40:07,641
So we have lion farms.

616
00:40:09,576 --> 00:40:13,747
All the big males are shot
in canned lion-hunting farms.

617
00:40:13,780 --> 00:40:18,151
Some rich, fucking lazy,
dickhead comes here with $100,000,

618
00:40:18,185 --> 00:40:19,486
shoots the animal,
flies back,

619
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:21,555
he's got a nice big head
he can put on his wall,

620
00:40:21,588 --> 00:40:24,056
and a story about
how brave he was

621
00:40:24,090 --> 00:40:26,727
to kill the king
of the jungle.

622
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:28,462
These animals
have never known freedom.

623
00:40:28,495 --> 00:40:31,231
Where they put them out,
that's where they die.

624
00:40:31,265 --> 00:40:34,234
- That's fucked up.
- It is fucked up.

625
00:40:34,268 --> 00:40:36,035
This is fucked up.

626
00:40:39,640 --> 00:40:43,610
Looks like maybe the lions
got their own back.

627
00:40:43,644 --> 00:40:45,379
Good.

628
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:48,549
- What do you think, like...
- Hmm.

629
00:40:48,582 --> 00:40:50,350
I don't know.
Maybe two days?

630
00:40:50,384 --> 00:40:52,252
Hmm, huh.

631
00:40:53,887 --> 00:40:56,690
I don't know. I don't know.
I can't tell in this heat.

632
00:40:59,693 --> 00:41:03,730
Generator went down...
the lions dug themselves out.

633
00:41:05,832 --> 00:41:07,701
Okay, but where
did they go?

634
00:41:09,503 --> 00:41:11,805
Back to the bush.
There's no reason for them to stay here.

635
00:41:13,674 --> 00:41:15,475
Good luck to them.

636
00:41:17,778 --> 00:41:19,680
You know, Sam,
when I was a little boy...

637
00:41:19,713 --> 00:41:21,815
Oh, here we go.
Another "When I was a little boy" story.

638
00:41:21,848 --> 00:41:23,750
- No, no, no. This is a good one.
- I can't wait.

639
00:41:23,784 --> 00:41:26,620
When I was a little boy, I used to
dream about being chased by lions.

640
00:41:26,653 --> 00:41:29,456
And no matter how fast
or how high I jumped,

641
00:41:29,489 --> 00:41:31,391
those motherfuckers...

642
00:41:31,425 --> 00:41:34,428
<i>Hey, boss.
This place looks deserted.</i>

643
00:41:34,461 --> 00:41:36,263
<i>You got anything?</i>

644
00:41:36,296 --> 00:41:39,266
Yeah. We got a couple
of ripe bodies.

645
00:41:39,299 --> 00:41:41,735
- It's pretty gnarly.
- <i>Copy you.</i>

646
00:41:41,768 --> 00:41:43,670
<i>Got few more of these huts
to check out.</i>

647
00:41:43,704 --> 00:41:45,739
<i>Stand by.</i>

648
00:41:47,307 --> 00:41:49,109
Elijah?

649
00:42:03,423 --> 00:42:04,625
Elijah?!

650
00:42:10,230 --> 00:42:12,566
Elijah?!

651
00:42:15,435 --> 00:42:16,670
Elijah!

652
00:42:59,012 --> 00:43:01,348
Oh, shit...

653
00:43:01,381 --> 00:43:02,549
Fuck...

654
00:43:06,586 --> 00:43:07,754
Elijah.

655
00:43:09,923 --> 00:43:11,558
Elijah.

656
00:43:29,643 --> 00:43:30,610
What are they shooting at?!

657
00:43:30,644 --> 00:43:31,945
Get down!
Get down!

658
00:43:31,978 --> 00:43:33,547
Get down!
Get down! Shh.

659
00:43:33,580 --> 00:43:35,015
What do you see?

660
00:43:35,048 --> 00:43:36,683
- Okay, okay.
- What do you see?

661
00:43:36,717 --> 00:43:38,885
Stay down. Get down.

662
00:43:38,919 --> 00:43:40,520
- Quiet.
- Please.

663
00:43:40,554 --> 00:43:41,922
- Okay.
- Shh.

664
00:43:41,955 --> 00:43:45,258
Hey, Bo.
You stay with them, okay?

665
00:43:45,292 --> 00:43:47,728
No, you stay.
You're more injured.

666
00:43:47,761 --> 00:43:49,996
This?

667
00:43:50,030 --> 00:43:52,332
What's that?

668
00:43:57,003 --> 00:43:59,673
Hey, be my guest.

669
00:43:59,706 --> 00:44:01,041
You're supposed
to argue more.

670
00:44:01,074 --> 00:44:02,909
Nah, we're good.

671
00:44:40,914 --> 00:44:43,083
- Jesus...
- What is it? What happened?

672
00:44:43,117 --> 00:44:45,051
- Something took Elijah.
- What do you mean, something?

673
00:44:45,085 --> 00:44:47,320
- Is he dead?
- Yes, he's fucking dead.

674
00:44:47,354 --> 00:44:49,356
He-he's torn to pieces.

675
00:46:01,595 --> 00:46:06,666
Bo Yinn, what would
your mother say, huh?

676
00:46:06,700 --> 00:46:08,368
She'd say...

677
00:46:09,536 --> 00:46:12,572
Oh, shit!

678
00:46:12,606 --> 00:46:14,175
Shit. Stay here.

679
00:46:14,208 --> 00:46:15,675
Don't move!
Don't move!

680
00:46:15,709 --> 00:46:17,777
No, no, no,
no, no, no, no.

681
00:46:17,811 --> 00:46:19,713
Bo! Bo!

682
00:46:34,060 --> 00:46:35,629
Lion...

683
00:46:38,199 --> 00:46:39,666
A lion...

684
00:46:39,699 --> 00:46:42,669
I got it.

685
00:46:42,702 --> 00:46:44,571
- It's injured.
- Yeah, good job.

686
00:46:44,604 --> 00:46:45,739
You tagged it, buddy.

687
00:46:45,772 --> 00:46:47,141
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

688
00:46:47,174 --> 00:46:49,143
Yeah.

689
00:46:49,176 --> 00:46:52,213
Ooh, got you too
a little bit, huh?

690
00:46:52,246 --> 00:46:55,182
Okay, he got me, too.
Just a little bit.

691
00:46:55,216 --> 00:46:58,518
- What the fuck happened here?
- A fucking lion got him.

692
00:46:58,551 --> 00:47:01,021
Shit. One killed
Elijah, too.

693
00:47:01,054 --> 00:47:03,089
Elijah's dead?

694
00:47:03,124 --> 00:47:05,725
- All right, put it down.
- Okay, get his webbing off.

695
00:47:05,759 --> 00:47:07,060
- Look at me, Bo. Look at me.
- Get his webbing off, we need to see.

696
00:47:07,093 --> 00:47:09,230
There you go. There you go.

697
00:47:09,263 --> 00:47:12,098
Okay, he's got lacerations
all up the left side.

698
00:47:12,133 --> 00:47:13,900
- Give him that morphine, give him that morphine.
- He's bleeding out here.

699
00:47:13,934 --> 00:47:15,602
- What happened to him?
- Someone get the tourniquet.

700
00:47:15,635 --> 00:47:18,505
- Someone talk to me!
- Okay. Bo, look at me.

701
00:47:18,538 --> 00:47:20,607
Give him the lollipop.
He needs the morphine. Get it.

702
00:47:20,640 --> 00:47:21,841
What the fuck
happened to him?

703
00:47:21,875 --> 00:47:24,245
- A lion!
- My God!

704
00:47:24,278 --> 00:47:26,546
- Come help. Help now.
- Hold on. This is gonna hurt, buddy.

705
00:47:26,579 --> 00:47:28,648
- Lion attack him.
- There you go.

706
00:47:28,682 --> 00:47:30,550
I need you
to put pressure on this wound.

707
00:47:30,583 --> 00:47:32,253
- Hold on, man. Hold on, Bo.
- No, I don't wanna hurt him.

708
00:47:32,286 --> 00:47:34,754
Put pressure on the wound,
or he'll fucking die.

709
00:47:34,788 --> 00:47:36,523
- I got it. I got it.
- There you go.

710
00:47:36,556 --> 00:47:38,658
- Press it down. Down.
- Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

711
00:47:38,692 --> 00:47:40,694
- Hold on, buddy.
- Oh, fuck.

712
00:47:40,727 --> 00:47:43,230
- There you go.
- Hey, Bo?

713
00:47:43,264 --> 00:47:44,931
- Hey, hey...
- Hey, hey, hey.

714
00:47:44,965 --> 00:47:45,932
Stay with me.

715
00:47:45,966 --> 00:47:47,234
- Stay with us!
- Stay here.

716
00:47:47,268 --> 00:47:48,668
- Bo, in the room, in the room.
- Fuck. Fuck!

724
00:48:05,286 --> 00:48:07,654
You're right, it is very annoying.

725
00:48:07,687 --> 00:48:09,956
- Very annoying.
- It's very annoying.

726
00:48:21,835 --> 00:48:25,538
Boss, boss!
I've picked up their trail.

727
00:48:25,572 --> 00:48:27,108
- Where?
- Five miles, south.

728
00:48:27,141 --> 00:48:29,310
Well done, brother.
Let's go!

729
00:48:29,343 --> 00:48:30,577
Come on. Come on!

730
00:48:43,124 --> 00:48:45,025
Joey, Mike.

731
00:48:58,239 --> 00:49:00,073
I gave him
all the morphine we had.

732
00:49:00,107 --> 00:49:02,209
The bleeding has stopped,
but he needs an extraction.

733
00:49:02,243 --> 00:49:04,245
We all need
an extraction.

734
00:49:04,278 --> 00:49:06,679
So we gotta get comms up.

735
00:49:06,713 --> 00:49:08,848
All right. So this is us.

736
00:49:08,882 --> 00:49:12,085
There's a VHF radio in this
building, but it has no power.

737
00:49:12,119 --> 00:49:14,355
I didn't see a generator,
but you gotta assume there is one.

738
00:49:14,388 --> 00:49:16,357
Uh, you also gotta assume
that it's out of gas.

739
00:49:16,390 --> 00:49:19,160
So we're gonna identify
the generator, gas it up,

740
00:49:19,193 --> 00:49:22,229
get the power on,
get the radio working.

741
00:49:22,263 --> 00:49:23,797
All before
our friends come back.

742
00:49:23,830 --> 00:49:25,598
Lion friends,
or terrorist friends?

743
00:49:25,632 --> 00:49:26,733
Grindr friends.

744
00:49:27,934 --> 00:49:29,669
Look, I think
we can do this.

745
00:49:29,702 --> 00:49:31,604
I know we've all
been through a lot worse.

746
00:49:31,638 --> 00:49:35,942
No. Not without ammo,
fucking weapons, or some backup.

747
00:49:35,975 --> 00:49:39,079
There's a first time
for everything.

748
00:49:39,113 --> 00:49:41,681
Plus, I think there's
many places a lion can hide here.

749
00:49:41,714 --> 00:49:44,118
And why is
the fucking thing still here?

750
00:49:44,151 --> 00:49:47,620
Seriously, why isn't it out with
his fucking fuzzy friends out there?

751
00:49:48,955 --> 00:49:51,158
Because some lions go rogue.

752
00:49:51,192 --> 00:49:54,161
They like to kill.

753
00:49:54,195 --> 00:49:56,297
So we're at the bottom
of the food chain.

754
00:49:57,997 --> 00:49:59,666
What's the deal with the ammo?
What do we got left?

755
00:50:09,410 --> 00:50:11,978
That's nothing.
Jesus.

756
00:50:12,011 --> 00:50:14,080
Shooting her
won't help anyway.

757
00:50:14,115 --> 00:50:15,316
This caliber...

758
00:50:16,350 --> 00:50:18,252
This is not going to stop her.

759
00:50:18,285 --> 00:50:21,322
It might annoy her,
but she will kill you first.

760
00:50:21,355 --> 00:50:23,157
How do you know
it's a "she"?

761
00:50:24,391 --> 00:50:26,726
Because females
are the true killers.

762
00:50:29,929 --> 00:50:33,134
Okay. Well, what about, uh,
what about fire?

763
00:50:33,167 --> 00:50:36,137
They're afraid of fire, right?
Can we make that work?

764
00:50:36,170 --> 00:50:39,706
Truth with lions, actually,
they're not afraid of fire.

765
00:50:39,739 --> 00:50:41,708
In fact, it might
even attract them.

766
00:50:43,977 --> 00:50:46,779
Makes you wonder how the fuck we got
out of Africa in the first place, huh?

767
00:50:46,813 --> 00:50:49,383
Why do you know
so much about lions?

768
00:50:49,416 --> 00:50:53,019
Our Maasai people have been living
alongside lions for generations.

769
00:50:53,052 --> 00:50:57,191
Hunting them is a tradition.
Passage into manhood.

770
00:50:57,224 --> 00:51:00,793
In fact, a boy has to kill
a lion in order to be a man.

771
00:51:01,794 --> 00:51:03,029
So you've killed one?

772
00:51:06,433 --> 00:51:09,236
No, I didn't.

773
00:51:09,270 --> 00:51:12,005
I couldn't.
I just couldn't.

774
00:51:12,038 --> 00:51:16,410
I couldn't take life in order to
prove some kind of ideal of manhood.

775
00:51:19,513 --> 00:51:22,383
I... I shamed my family.

776
00:51:22,416 --> 00:51:25,919
Hey, I-I think
that the ability to kill

777
00:51:25,952 --> 00:51:28,888
is the least quality
that it takes to be a man.

778
00:51:33,194 --> 00:51:35,296
So what do you do when
something tries to kill you?

779
00:51:37,464 --> 00:51:39,333
I guess we'll find out.

780
00:51:46,773 --> 00:51:49,776
- You ready?
- Yeah.

781
00:51:49,809 --> 00:51:52,413
Barasa, you see anything?

782
00:51:55,382 --> 00:51:57,351
Almost in position, boss.

783
00:51:58,785 --> 00:52:00,019
Stand by.

784
00:52:11,030 --> 00:52:12,299
Okay.

785
00:52:17,137 --> 00:52:18,071
Come on.

786
00:52:20,073 --> 00:52:23,910
Oh, fuck. Where's
this fucking thing?

787
00:52:26,547 --> 00:52:28,982
I'm gonna go check
these buildings over here.

788
00:52:29,015 --> 00:52:30,251
You get our six.

789
00:52:30,284 --> 00:52:31,385
Copy.

790
00:52:31,418 --> 00:52:36,956
Sam... Sam,
don't run.

791
00:52:36,990 --> 00:52:38,425
Do not act like prey.

792
00:52:41,928 --> 00:52:43,364
We are prey.

793
00:52:52,206 --> 00:52:54,073
It's just a walk
in the woods.

794
00:52:54,108 --> 00:52:55,409
I hate the woods.

795
00:53:11,458 --> 00:53:15,229
Got ya.
It's all clear, boss.

796
00:53:15,262 --> 00:53:16,463
<i>Copy.</i>

797
00:53:32,313 --> 00:53:36,949
Pata, eyes on you.
You hold there.

798
00:53:36,983 --> 00:53:38,885
<i>Okay, copy you.</i>

799
00:54:01,675 --> 00:54:03,843
Wait! Stop, stop, stop!

800
00:54:04,645 --> 00:54:07,348
The lion is right there.

801
00:54:07,381 --> 00:54:09,550
Ten o'clock.
Keep still, don't move.

802
00:54:22,061 --> 00:54:23,130
Fucking things!

803
00:54:24,131 --> 00:54:25,898
Talk to me.

804
00:54:25,932 --> 00:54:28,034
Where is she?

805
00:54:28,067 --> 00:54:30,604
<i>Bear with me, boss.
Technical problems.</i>

806
00:54:30,637 --> 00:54:33,340
Not prey.
Not prey. Not prey.

807
00:54:33,374 --> 00:54:34,475
Not prey.

808
00:54:37,444 --> 00:54:40,280
Barasa, can you see her?

809
00:54:42,081 --> 00:54:44,385
<i>Okay, okay,
just-just give me a second.</i>

810
00:54:44,418 --> 00:54:45,619
We go back?

811
00:54:47,388 --> 00:54:49,323
We gotta have
that radio, Joey.

812
00:54:51,392 --> 00:54:54,261
Barasa, anything?

813
00:54:54,294 --> 00:54:55,496
<i>Okay, stand by.</i>

814
00:55:01,568 --> 00:55:02,636
Fuck.

815
00:55:04,304 --> 00:55:05,972
We lost her, boss.

816
00:55:10,611 --> 00:55:12,312
Start walking.

817
00:55:16,450 --> 00:55:18,285
<i>Get me eyes
on her. Copy?</i>

818
00:55:18,318 --> 00:55:19,686
Stand by, boss.

819
00:55:20,687 --> 00:55:22,489
Fucking equipment failure.

820
00:55:29,129 --> 00:55:30,497
<i>Nothing, boss.</i>

821
00:55:30,531 --> 00:55:34,301
Okay. I'll go east,
you go west.

822
00:55:47,548 --> 00:55:51,151
Oh, yes! Wow!

823
00:55:55,789 --> 00:55:58,192
Fuck. Shit!

824
00:55:59,426 --> 00:56:02,196
Oh, shit!

825
00:56:05,132 --> 00:56:08,502
Joey, I found the
generator, but there's no fuel.

826
00:56:10,270 --> 00:56:12,773
I can fix that.
I found the fuel.

827
00:56:12,806 --> 00:56:14,775
Bring it to me.

828
00:56:14,808 --> 00:56:16,276
Yeah, coming now.

829
00:56:34,561 --> 00:56:36,530
Fucking thing!

830
00:56:36,563 --> 00:56:38,398
Shit.

831
00:56:40,400 --> 00:56:42,102
Fucking things!

832
00:56:52,212 --> 00:56:54,214
Thank you.

833
00:56:57,484 --> 00:56:59,419
There. All right.

834
00:57:01,388 --> 00:57:03,055
Oh, my gosh!

835
00:57:05,659 --> 00:57:06,527
C'mon!

836
00:57:10,531 --> 00:57:12,165
Yeah, that's it.

837
00:58:13,427 --> 00:58:15,329
We're back
in business, boss.

838
00:58:42,422 --> 00:58:45,459
Yeah. All right.

839
00:58:47,961 --> 00:58:51,198
C'mon, baby.

840
00:59:06,813 --> 00:59:07,881
All right.

841
00:59:24,297 --> 00:59:25,866
No! No, no.

842
00:59:28,635 --> 00:59:30,170
<i>Boss...</i>

843
00:59:31,605 --> 00:59:32,572
<i>She got him.</i>

844
00:59:32,606 --> 00:59:35,275
Barasa's gone.

845
00:59:38,578 --> 00:59:40,580
Shit! On me!

846
00:59:49,356 --> 00:59:51,358
Goodbye, my friend.

847
00:59:59,700 --> 01:00:01,501
Station One,
this is Rogue Team, over.

848
01:00:01,535 --> 01:00:04,938
Come on...

849
01:00:04,971 --> 01:00:07,574
Station One,
this is Rogue Team, over.

850
01:00:07,607 --> 01:00:11,378
<i>Rogue
Team, go for Station One.</i>

851
01:00:11,411 --> 01:00:14,581
We lost the Osprey extraction,
and we're in urgent need of assistance.

852
01:00:14,614 --> 01:00:17,684
We have the governor's daughter plus one.
She's a British national.

853
01:00:17,718 --> 01:00:21,521
We've an Al-Shabaab militia
group in close proximity.

854
01:00:21,555 --> 01:00:23,390
We're out of ammo.

855
01:00:23,423 --> 01:00:26,493
We have multiple wounded,
we have hostile animals near.

856
01:00:26,526 --> 01:00:28,862
We're in urgent need
of extraction. How copy?

857
01:00:30,897 --> 01:00:33,567
<i>Copy that.
That's a negative on extraction.</i>

858
01:00:35,035 --> 01:00:36,903
<i>No asset free until dawn.</i>

859
01:00:39,639 --> 01:00:42,042
Negative. We're not
gonna make it six hours.

860
01:00:42,075 --> 01:00:44,878
We need assistance now.
Put Briggs on.

861
01:00:44,911 --> 01:00:46,546
<i>Roger that.</i>

862
01:00:48,715 --> 01:00:51,852
<i>Sam, this is Briggs.
Send sitrep.</i>

863
01:00:51,885 --> 01:00:53,587
We have the girl.

864
01:00:53,620 --> 01:00:55,722
<i>Good job. I'll let
the governor know.</i>

865
01:00:55,756 --> 01:00:58,759
<i>Heard you're having
a little trouble?</i>

866
01:00:58,792 --> 01:01:02,562
We're not gonna
make the night.

867
01:01:02,596 --> 01:01:05,665
<i>You will.
You always do, Sam.</i>

868
01:01:05,699 --> 01:01:08,668
<i>That's why I bring you
on the tough jobs.</i>

869
01:01:08,702 --> 01:01:13,273
<i>Make it till dawn, and I promise
you, I'll get you out of there.</i>

870
01:01:19,045 --> 01:01:20,847
Dawn. Copy. Out.

871
01:01:26,853 --> 01:01:30,557
Whose stupid fucking idea
was this mission anyway?

872
01:01:30,590 --> 01:01:32,859
Uh, yours.

873
01:01:34,995 --> 01:01:36,363
Oh, yeah.

874
01:01:37,898 --> 01:01:39,933
Help is coming.

875
01:01:41,601 --> 01:01:42,969
We just have to stay here
a little while longer.

876
01:01:43,003 --> 01:01:46,373
- How much longer?
- Till sunrise.

877
01:01:47,374 --> 01:01:48,842
What? We can't do that.

878
01:01:48,875 --> 01:01:51,411
Yes, you can.
Just a few more hours.

879
01:01:51,444 --> 01:01:53,580
But, Sam,
they will come for us.

880
01:01:53,613 --> 01:01:56,383
They won't. They don't know where you are.
You're safe, it's fine.

881
01:01:56,416 --> 01:01:59,653
We're not safe here.
Zalaam does not give up.

882
01:02:00,821 --> 01:02:02,422
She is of value to them.

883
01:02:02,455 --> 01:02:04,724
She was not taken
just for a ransom of money.

884
01:02:04,758 --> 01:02:06,993
She means they have power
over her father.

885
01:02:07,027 --> 01:02:09,563
That gives him control
over this entire region.

886
01:02:10,797 --> 01:02:12,866
You seem to know
an awful lot about him.

887
01:02:12,899 --> 01:02:14,401
Why is that?

888
01:02:14,434 --> 01:02:15,969
Because I was
an Al-Shabaab soldier.

889
01:02:17,037 --> 01:02:18,939
I'm sorry.
What the fuck?

890
01:02:20,006 --> 01:02:21,142
Hey, no!

891
01:02:21,175 --> 01:02:23,110
You're one of them!

892
01:02:23,144 --> 01:02:25,146
Does my father know
that you've trusted the enemy?

893
01:02:25,179 --> 01:02:26,513
Your father knows
a lot more than you think.

894
01:02:26,546 --> 01:02:27,814
What does that mean?

895
01:02:27,848 --> 01:02:29,916
We couldn't have rescued
you without Pata.

896
01:02:31,017 --> 01:02:32,519
I'll take this, okay?

897
01:02:32,552 --> 01:02:34,521
No bullets.
We're out of ammo, remember?

898
01:02:34,554 --> 01:02:36,056
The men that took us
are evil!

899
01:02:36,089 --> 01:02:38,859
I'm not evil!
I'm not like one of them!

900
01:02:38,892 --> 01:02:43,164
I would never be abducting
little girls and be...

901
01:02:43,197 --> 01:02:45,031
Asilia,
Asilia, show 'em.

902
01:02:45,065 --> 01:02:47,500
- Oh, fucking Christ!
- No!

903
01:02:47,534 --> 01:02:49,736
He needs to see!
Look at this!

904
01:02:49,769 --> 01:02:52,806
They whipped her, and they beat us!
Look at that!

905
01:02:55,876 --> 01:02:58,678
I don't know what
your idea of evil is,

906
01:02:58,712 --> 01:03:00,647
but if you're with the kind
of people that do that,

907
01:03:00,680 --> 01:03:03,683
then you're not coming out the other
side as Mother fucking Theresa.

908
01:03:10,957 --> 01:03:13,793
I was... I was young
when I... when I joined.

909
01:03:13,827 --> 01:03:15,196
So?

910
01:03:15,229 --> 01:03:17,631
I tried to leave long ago.

911
01:03:17,664 --> 01:03:21,202
But they made it clear
that... if you leave,

912
01:03:21,235 --> 01:03:23,204
they will kill your
children and your family.

913
01:03:23,237 --> 01:03:24,738
So I stayed.

914
01:03:26,740 --> 01:03:28,842
Zalaam came from England,

915
01:03:28,875 --> 01:03:31,811
a man with many ideas
to teach us.

916
01:03:31,845 --> 01:03:34,181
To teach the people
the ways of Allah.

917
01:03:34,215 --> 01:03:36,082
Jesus Christ,
get to the fucking point!

918
01:03:36,117 --> 01:03:37,651
I left!

919
01:03:37,684 --> 01:03:41,021
We escaped, okay?
That is why I'm here.

920
01:03:41,054 --> 01:03:42,689
But they came.

921
01:03:42,722 --> 01:03:44,724
And they did exactly

922
01:03:44,758 --> 01:03:46,793
what they said
that they would do.

923
01:03:48,895 --> 01:03:50,497
My children...

924
01:03:52,599 --> 01:03:53,934
My family...

925
01:03:57,271 --> 01:03:59,873
All of them, you see?

926
01:03:59,906 --> 01:04:02,976
And they decided
to-to keep me alive,

927
01:04:03,009 --> 01:04:05,545
and they made me watch.

928
01:04:09,049 --> 01:04:13,520
They came to our school...
our class.

929
01:04:16,157 --> 01:04:18,591
They lined eight of us
against the wall...

930
01:04:19,960 --> 01:04:22,929
told us to get down
on our knees,

931
01:04:22,963 --> 01:04:25,565
bound our hands
behind our back,

932
01:04:25,598 --> 01:04:27,101
put bags over our heads.

933
01:04:28,868 --> 01:04:31,905
And he said,
if we made a sound...

934
01:04:33,873 --> 01:04:35,675
he would shoot us.

935
01:04:41,081 --> 01:04:44,617
And we waited.
We waited to die.

936
01:04:49,323 --> 01:04:51,258
We didn't make a sound.

937
01:04:53,994 --> 01:04:56,863
I waited my turn to die!

938
01:04:57,864 --> 01:05:01,034
We waited our turn to die!

939
01:05:05,605 --> 01:05:09,143
He killed them,
when they could've just taken me!

940
01:05:10,577 --> 01:05:12,912
I never saw any hostages.

941
01:05:12,946 --> 01:05:16,082
Those hostages have names!

942
01:05:16,117 --> 01:05:17,617
We have names!

943
01:05:20,086 --> 01:05:22,223
What were
your children's names?

944
01:05:25,326 --> 01:05:26,993
What were their names?

945
01:05:30,930 --> 01:05:32,932
What were their names?

946
01:05:33,933 --> 01:05:35,202
I'm sorry.

947
01:05:43,743 --> 01:05:46,012
Boss, somebody
needs to keep watch.

948
01:05:49,783 --> 01:05:51,252
I need to keep watch, boss.

949
01:06:08,169 --> 01:06:09,636
The others in position?

950
01:06:09,669 --> 01:06:12,173
All in position.

951
01:06:12,206 --> 01:06:15,642
Spread out.
Come in from all sides.

952
01:06:15,675 --> 01:06:18,812
And remember,
the girl lives.

953
01:06:18,845 --> 01:06:21,282
Everyone else,
do as Allah commands.

954
01:06:22,916 --> 01:06:23,917
Go!

955
01:06:26,187 --> 01:06:28,054
It's about time
we let them know we're here.

956
01:06:28,088 --> 01:06:30,890
- Yeah, it is.
- You got the C-4?

957
01:06:32,293 --> 01:06:33,327
Let's go.

958
01:07:17,238 --> 01:07:19,306
She's a good girl.

959
01:07:19,340 --> 01:07:20,640
Yeah.

960
01:07:21,908 --> 01:07:24,211
She cares about things.

961
01:07:24,245 --> 01:07:25,945
More than I do, anyway.

962
01:07:27,281 --> 01:07:29,082
Are you guys friends?

963
01:07:29,116 --> 01:07:32,186
Hmm, not really.

964
01:07:32,219 --> 01:07:35,456
I mean, I hardly knew her
before this little adventure.

965
01:07:35,489 --> 01:07:37,358
Why are you in Africa?

966
01:07:38,359 --> 01:07:40,461
Just lucky, I guess.

967
01:07:40,494 --> 01:07:43,197
My parents' grand idea
to help ground me

968
01:07:43,230 --> 01:07:46,367
was to send me to an expensive
international school.

969
01:07:46,400 --> 01:07:50,703
Wow. Count yourself
lucky.

970
01:07:50,737 --> 01:07:56,277
I mean, my parents sent me to
military academy when I was 13.

971
01:07:56,310 --> 01:08:00,079
I don't think I even
left campus before I was 16.

972
01:08:00,114 --> 01:08:02,116
From there, it was
straight into basic training,

973
01:08:02,149 --> 01:08:05,352
and then right
into the Rangers Academy.

974
01:08:06,786 --> 01:08:09,956
So no husband,
kids, ten cats?

975
01:08:09,989 --> 01:08:12,293
No, no, and no. Mm.

976
01:08:13,494 --> 01:08:15,061
I live a moment away
from death,

977
01:08:15,094 --> 01:08:17,464
either mine
or someone else's,

978
01:08:17,498 --> 01:08:21,801
so I just don't really want to do
that to another person, you know.

979
01:08:21,834 --> 01:08:23,437
Yeah.

980
01:08:23,470 --> 01:08:26,039
I mean, I figured you were
just too much of a bitch

981
01:08:26,072 --> 01:08:29,510
- for someone to handle.
- Yeah, there is that.

982
01:08:32,313 --> 01:08:35,416
So what are you gonna do
when you get home?

983
01:08:37,117 --> 01:08:38,751
You think
we're getting home?

984
01:08:38,785 --> 01:08:42,722
Five more hours.
Cakewalk.

985
01:08:44,325 --> 01:08:46,993
He's here, he's here!

986
01:08:47,026 --> 01:08:48,828
Zalaam is here!
He's coming!

987
01:08:48,861 --> 01:08:49,862
Sit down.

988
01:08:49,896 --> 01:08:51,232
Hey, just get over there.

989
01:08:51,265 --> 01:08:53,367
Sit down. Sit now!

990
01:08:53,400 --> 01:08:56,869
Okay, so, I spotted a scout over on the east side.

991
01:08:56,903 --> 01:08:58,272
- Whoa! Whoa!
- Hey!

992
01:08:58,305 --> 01:08:59,973
What are you doing,
you crazy little man?

993
01:09:00,006 --> 01:09:02,309
I heard there is a fight
that I didn't want to miss out.

994
01:09:02,343 --> 01:09:05,845
Okay, there's no ammo in this.
You're gonna stay here with the girls.

995
01:09:05,878 --> 01:09:08,382
No, I can fight. Let me fight.
I can't just sit here.

996
01:09:08,415 --> 01:09:10,484
That's exactly what you're gonna do.
Sit the fuck down, right now!

997
01:09:10,517 --> 01:09:11,784
- No!
- Captain's orders.

998
01:09:11,818 --> 01:09:13,853
She's not a captain.

999
01:09:13,886 --> 01:09:15,088
Are you?
Are you a captain?

1000
01:09:15,122 --> 01:09:17,056
You know
I'm a fucking captain, Bo.

1001
01:09:17,090 --> 01:09:18,359
- But you're a girl.
- Whoa! Hey!

1002
01:09:18,392 --> 01:09:19,460
That's just
the morphine talking.

1003
01:09:19,493 --> 01:09:21,262
Come here.
Let's have a lie down.

1004
01:09:21,295 --> 01:09:23,896
- I'm here.
- There you go, Bo. There you go.

1005
01:09:23,930 --> 01:09:25,798
And if you feel the need
to walk to that big,

1006
01:09:25,832 --> 01:09:28,435
bright light at the end of the
tunnel, just remember...

1007
01:09:28,469 --> 01:09:32,905
- <i>♪ Everybody ♪</i>
- Yeah, yeah, that's right.

1008
01:09:32,939 --> 01:09:35,376
<i>♪ Everybody ♪</i>

1009
01:09:35,409 --> 01:09:37,010
Sam, what's the plan?

1010
01:09:37,043 --> 01:09:39,346
Sit down. Sit down!

1011
01:09:39,380 --> 01:09:41,848
- That's not the plan.
- Shut the fuck up! Sit down!

1012
01:09:43,550 --> 01:09:47,020
Holy shit, boss!
Good news.

1013
01:09:47,053 --> 01:09:48,522
Joey, what've you got?

1014
01:09:48,555 --> 01:09:51,924
Boss, I found a Lee Enfield.
It's got nine rounds.

1015
01:09:51,958 --> 01:09:55,462
I figured we could shoot a couple of those
fuckers, take their AKs, even the odds.

1016
01:09:55,496 --> 01:09:56,929
Boom!

1017
01:09:58,299 --> 01:09:59,533
Get out!

1018
01:09:59,566 --> 01:10:01,302
Oh, shit!

1019
01:10:04,104 --> 01:10:05,306
Hey! Hey!

1020
01:10:19,952 --> 01:10:22,156
Get off me,
you...

1021
01:10:22,189 --> 01:10:26,327
Hey! Me! Me! Look at me!

1022
01:10:30,597 --> 01:10:32,566
Oh, fuck!

1023
01:10:49,683 --> 01:10:51,017
Tessa!

1024
01:11:49,243 --> 01:11:51,178
Oh, fuck!

1025
01:11:53,514 --> 01:11:57,317
Okay. Well,
that doesn't work.

1026
01:11:57,351 --> 01:11:58,552
That's right.

1027
01:11:58,585 --> 01:12:01,087
Fuck you good.
Fuck you, pussycat.

1028
01:12:01,121 --> 01:12:03,157
Just because I'm
a fucking dog person, eh?

1029
01:12:11,732 --> 01:12:13,267
Come here, kitty cat!

1030
01:12:49,436 --> 01:12:53,307
Sam, draw it out!
Give me the shot!

1031
01:12:54,441 --> 01:12:57,478
Sam! Sam, you gotta move.

1032
01:12:57,511 --> 01:12:59,313
You gotta draw it out
so I can get a shot.

1033
01:13:14,695 --> 01:13:16,062
Hey, kitty, kitty.

1034
01:13:44,124 --> 01:13:46,193
Holy shit!

1035
01:13:46,226 --> 01:13:49,229
Well, turns out Pata was right.
They really were coming.

1036
01:13:49,263 --> 01:13:51,164
Jesus, Joey, that lion
really fucked you up.

1037
01:13:51,198 --> 01:13:52,666
Yeah, I've had
worse relationships.

1038
01:13:52,699 --> 01:13:54,835
But those scars,
they're deep on the inside.

1039
01:13:54,868 --> 01:13:57,471
Can you see them?
You good for this fight?

1040
01:13:57,504 --> 01:13:59,373
Are you good to do this?

1041
01:13:59,406 --> 01:14:01,775
Oh, yeah. Yeah, I got a...
I got a little gas in the tank.

1042
01:14:01,808 --> 01:14:03,377
No, not a whole,
but light...

1043
01:14:03,410 --> 01:14:05,312
light's on, you know,
but it's not empty.

1044
01:14:06,380 --> 01:14:08,248
- Good
- Yeah, you want a gun?

1045
01:14:08,282 --> 01:14:10,851
No, no, I'm gonna figure something out.
You keep this.

1046
01:14:10,884 --> 01:14:13,253
Let's go get the girls.

1047
01:14:13,287 --> 01:14:14,154
Let's fucking go.

1048
01:14:16,857 --> 01:14:19,326
All right, fuckers! Move!

1049
01:14:19,359 --> 01:14:20,827
Light 'em up!

1050
01:14:22,362 --> 01:14:23,363
Keep moving, boss!

1051
01:14:24,364 --> 01:14:25,832
- Boss?
- Moving!

1052
01:14:31,805 --> 01:14:32,706
Move!

1053
01:14:39,446 --> 01:14:40,480
Are you okay?

1054
01:14:40,514 --> 01:14:41,548
He's here.

1055
01:14:41,582 --> 01:14:43,383
Zalaam's here?

1056
01:14:43,417 --> 01:14:45,319
Yeah, it looks like it.
Where's Tess?

1057
01:14:45,352 --> 01:14:47,721
She was...
I thought she was behind me.

1058
01:14:47,754 --> 01:14:50,390
- We have to find her.
- Yes, I'm going to.

1059
01:14:50,424 --> 01:14:52,526
You have to stay here,
and you do not fucking move

1060
01:14:52,559 --> 01:14:54,227
until I tell you,
do you understand?

1061
01:14:54,261 --> 01:14:55,562
Do you understand?

1062
01:14:55,596 --> 01:14:57,297
Yes!

1063
01:14:57,331 --> 01:15:00,400
Joey. Joey.

1064
01:15:00,434 --> 01:15:02,803
Joey, I've got Asilia.
She's in the comms room.

1065
01:15:02,836 --> 01:15:04,104
Do you have eyes
on the other one?

1066
01:15:05,572 --> 01:15:07,574
That's a negative, boss.

1067
01:15:10,210 --> 01:15:12,379
But I'll keep my eyes open.

1068
01:15:12,412 --> 01:15:14,414
<i>Thank you. Out.</i>

1069
01:15:14,448 --> 01:15:15,782
Okay.

1070
01:15:18,251 --> 01:15:21,455
Okay. That's quite heavy.

1071
01:15:46,847 --> 01:15:48,715
Shit!

1072
01:15:48,749 --> 01:15:49,916
No!

1073
01:15:52,619 --> 01:15:54,454
No!

1074
01:15:56,857 --> 01:15:58,392
No need
to take you alive.

1075
01:16:04,264 --> 01:16:06,500
Come on! Grab on, let's go!

1076
01:16:06,533 --> 01:16:07,634
No, no, Sam!

1077
01:16:10,804 --> 01:16:11,905
Run! Back!

1078
01:16:16,309 --> 01:16:17,678
Up, now, now, now.

1079
01:16:21,281 --> 01:16:22,282
Come on, get down.

1080
01:16:35,328 --> 01:16:37,931
Ooh, no,
he's gonna get me.

1081
01:16:37,964 --> 01:16:39,800
Ah, he missed.

1082
01:16:39,833 --> 01:16:41,435
There you are.

1083
01:16:41,468 --> 01:16:42,736
You son of a bitch.

1084
01:16:47,040 --> 01:16:48,608
Okay.

1085
01:16:50,911 --> 01:16:53,547
Ah... fuck, I'm good.

1086
01:17:14,835 --> 01:17:17,037
- Go, go, go, go, go.
- Follow me!

1087
01:17:20,841 --> 01:17:22,275
Okay.

1088
01:17:22,309 --> 01:17:23,410
Okay, when I say go,

1089
01:17:23,443 --> 01:17:24,845
you're gonna run
to the comms room,

1090
01:17:24,878 --> 01:17:26,880
Right there. It's where Asilia is.

1091
01:17:26,913 --> 01:17:28,515
- Okay?
- I'm not gonna leave you.

1092
01:17:28,548 --> 01:17:30,350
You can do it.
You can go, all right?

1093
01:17:30,383 --> 01:17:33,587
I'm gonna cover you. Okay?
When I say, go.

1094
01:17:33,620 --> 01:17:36,056
- Okay, okay. Yeah.
- Ready? Go.

1095
01:17:36,089 --> 01:17:37,524
Okay. Fuck!

1096
01:17:39,826 --> 01:17:40,794
Hold on!

1097
01:17:45,732 --> 01:17:47,567
Wait, wait, wait...

1098
01:17:53,707 --> 01:17:54,574
Shit.

1099
01:17:56,042 --> 01:17:58,678
Fucking stupid, Samantha.
Fuck.

1100
01:18:09,489 --> 01:18:11,558
All right, now we got
an even fight.

1101
01:18:21,401 --> 01:18:24,337
Asilia! Are you okay?

1102
01:18:24,371 --> 01:18:25,639
- Where's Sam?
- She's coming.

1103
01:18:25,672 --> 01:18:27,841
Get the door.
Get the door!

1104
01:18:33,114 --> 01:18:35,315
- Okay. You want help?
- Wait.

1105
01:18:36,850 --> 01:18:37,884
What?

1106
01:18:39,486 --> 01:18:40,987
Wait! We can't always
be babies.

1107
01:18:41,021 --> 01:18:42,923
We-we can't stay here,
we will die.

1108
01:18:42,956 --> 01:18:44,825
- I mean, yeah.
- We have to fight.

1109
01:18:44,858 --> 01:18:47,861
- You wanna fight?
- I've never fought back in my entire life,

1110
01:18:47,894 --> 01:18:50,530
- but I wanna fucking fight!
- Okay.

1111
01:18:51,865 --> 01:18:53,400
- Okay, you ready?
- Shh.

1112
01:18:57,771 --> 01:18:59,439
Okay.

1113
01:19:04,411 --> 01:19:06,546
Hey, boss. I've got you.

1114
01:19:07,547 --> 01:19:09,950
Here, take this.

1115
01:19:13,820 --> 01:19:15,789
- Moving.
- Covering!

1116
01:19:26,766 --> 01:19:28,068
Okay...

1117
01:19:33,874 --> 01:19:36,810
There's no one else I would've
rather been kidnapped with.

1118
01:19:41,948 --> 01:19:44,551
That's fucked up even for you.

1119
01:19:44,584 --> 01:19:46,686
- I'm scared.
- Me too.

1120
01:19:47,854 --> 01:19:49,422
Me too.

1121
01:19:51,524 --> 01:19:52,959
Let's do this.

1122
01:19:54,895 --> 01:19:55,996
Okay, let's go.

1123
01:20:29,930 --> 01:20:30,997
Shit...

1124
01:20:35,669 --> 01:20:36,970
Oh, no. No.

1125
01:20:40,573 --> 01:20:41,675
Oh, no...

1126
01:21:27,887 --> 01:21:29,556
- You are Zalaam's now.
- No!

1127
01:21:29,589 --> 01:21:30,757
- Quiet now!
- Let go!

1128
01:22:14,235 --> 01:22:16,303
Masakh!

1129
01:22:18,738 --> 01:22:21,674
Pata! My brother!

1130
01:22:24,111 --> 01:22:26,247
You're still breathing, ah?

1131
01:22:36,723 --> 01:22:38,558
And you grow some balls.

1132
01:22:41,162 --> 01:22:42,163
Come.

1133
01:22:44,964 --> 01:22:46,066
Come!

1134
01:22:52,705 --> 01:22:54,040
Come again.

1135
01:22:57,178 --> 01:22:58,279
Ah?

1136
01:23:05,652 --> 01:23:08,255
Come on, man. Huh?

1137
01:23:23,270 --> 01:23:24,904
Coward!

1138
01:23:24,938 --> 01:23:26,873
Where was your bravery before,

1139
01:23:26,906 --> 01:23:30,111
when you stood by and watched
your family die, huh?

1140
01:23:44,458 --> 01:23:45,725
Hey...

1141
01:23:45,758 --> 01:23:47,261
Huh?

1142
01:23:47,294 --> 01:23:48,962
Hey?

1143
01:23:50,164 --> 01:23:51,332
Huh?

1144
01:23:54,067 --> 01:23:54,968
Huh?

1145
01:23:57,104 --> 01:24:00,640
We... let you live.

1146
01:24:01,442 --> 01:24:03,776
We let you live!

1147
01:24:03,810 --> 01:24:05,112
That was no life!

1148
01:24:16,323 --> 01:24:17,924
Stay down!

1149
01:24:19,926 --> 01:24:21,128
Look at me.

1150
01:24:24,063 --> 01:24:25,865
Look at me.

1151
01:24:29,002 --> 01:24:31,938
You took everything from me!

1152
01:24:31,971 --> 01:24:34,807
My children's names
were...

1153
01:24:35,509 --> 01:24:36,876
Tabu...

1154
01:24:38,279 --> 01:24:43,082
Josie and Sarah.

1155
01:24:54,161 --> 01:24:58,765
Now... Now, I am a man.

1156
01:25:03,170 --> 01:25:05,105
I think I saw him
over there!

1157
01:25:05,139 --> 01:25:06,005
Go...

1158
01:25:08,375 --> 01:25:10,211
This is a good death.

1159
01:25:12,346 --> 01:25:14,448
You did good, brother.

1160
01:25:14,481 --> 01:25:16,383
Your family would be proud.

1161
01:26:14,441 --> 01:26:16,075
Oh, hey, Bo.

1162
01:26:19,246 --> 01:26:20,514
My brother.

1163
01:26:22,249 --> 01:26:23,450
Why don't you
pull up a chair?

1164
01:26:38,031 --> 01:26:40,867
I clipped a guy
over-over there.

1165
01:26:41,868 --> 01:26:44,471
Hey, he dropped his AK.

1166
01:26:44,505 --> 01:26:46,873
You got the strength to
go over there and get it?

1167
01:26:49,008 --> 01:26:50,511
Yeah, me neither.

1168
01:26:56,116 --> 01:26:57,217
She's out there.

1169
01:26:57,251 --> 01:27:00,953
Uh, the lion? No.

1170
01:27:00,987 --> 01:27:06,327
No... with the fire
and the-the fighting, no.

1171
01:27:06,360 --> 01:27:09,163
There's no way she stayed.

1172
01:27:09,196 --> 01:27:11,398
She doesn't even
have a reason.

1173
01:27:13,933 --> 01:27:16,337
Unless she's just mean.

1174
01:27:19,273 --> 01:27:24,178
It's justice
if she takes us. Huh...

1175
01:27:24,211 --> 01:27:27,581
The things we've done
to this world...

1176
01:27:27,614 --> 01:27:29,015
Death...

1177
01:27:31,984 --> 01:27:33,520
So much death.

1178
01:27:35,356 --> 01:27:37,591
These creatures
were killed for what?

1179
01:27:40,594 --> 01:27:41,994
Medicine?

1180
01:27:42,995 --> 01:27:44,598
Magic charms?

1181
01:27:47,334 --> 01:27:50,237
I don't understand how anyone
would want these animals dead...

1182
01:27:51,672 --> 01:27:53,005
instead of alive.

1183
01:27:55,041 --> 01:27:57,043
For a belief
a thousand years old.

1184
01:28:00,314 --> 01:28:01,582
I'm ashamed.

1185
01:28:10,424 --> 01:28:11,958
Oh, hi, boys.

Well, that happened.

1196
01:28:59,273 --> 01:29:02,443
But you were right.
She <i>is</i> still out there.

1197
01:29:22,729 --> 01:29:25,732
You rest well,
you crazy Chinaman.

1198
01:29:46,220 --> 01:29:47,521
- What's going on?
- Fuck...

1199
01:29:47,554 --> 01:29:48,689
- Fuck you!
- Come here.

1200
01:29:49,823 --> 01:29:52,159
- Shit. Fuck!
- You bitch!

1201
01:29:52,192 --> 01:29:55,395
Fucking... Shit!

1202
01:29:55,429 --> 01:29:57,564
I should've known you'd be a
handful when we first got you.

1203
01:29:57,598 --> 01:29:59,266
Fucking Midlands girl,
right?

1204
01:29:59,299 --> 01:30:02,202
Fuck you!
Murderer! Traitor!

1205
01:30:02,236 --> 01:30:04,671
I'm not a murderer any more than
your government's a murderer.

1206
01:30:05,706 --> 01:30:07,307
Your government,
too, dickhead!

1207
01:30:07,341 --> 01:30:09,776
Nah. Not anymore.
It's not my country.

1208
01:30:09,810 --> 01:30:11,445
It never wouldn't wanted me
in the first place

1209
01:30:11,478 --> 01:30:13,213
or anyone in my skin color
or religion.

1210
01:30:13,247 --> 01:30:15,249
I don't get to go back home.

1211
01:30:15,282 --> 01:30:16,483
At least, I'm welcome here.

1212
01:30:16,517 --> 01:30:18,285
'Cause of what you've done!

1213
01:30:18,318 --> 01:30:19,686
- I haven't even started yet!
- No, no, no, no.

1214
01:30:19,720 --> 01:30:21,622
- Get up! Get up!
- No!

1215
01:30:21,655 --> 01:30:23,257
Get up!

1216
01:30:23,290 --> 01:30:25,125
- No, no, no...
- Shut your mouth!

1217
01:30:50,517 --> 01:30:53,554
Hey, baby.

1218
01:31:44,938 --> 01:31:46,907
No, no, no, no, no!

1219
01:31:46,940 --> 01:31:49,743
Let her go. Hey, hey.
She's not the one that you want.

1220
01:31:49,776 --> 01:31:52,245
You're not
the one I want, either.

1221
01:31:52,279 --> 01:31:53,647
So no, fuck it.

1222
01:31:53,680 --> 01:31:55,816
I think I might
cut her head off.

1223
01:31:55,849 --> 01:31:57,618
- No!
- Real slow!

1224
01:31:57,651 --> 01:32:01,622
Tess, Tess. Hey, hold still.
It's gonna be okay.

1225
01:32:01,655 --> 01:32:04,858
Why the fuck would you say that?
You know it's not gonna be.

1226
01:32:04,891 --> 01:32:07,527
Huh? Shut the fuck up!

1227
01:32:12,899 --> 01:32:15,636
Okay, take me. Okay?

1228
01:32:15,669 --> 01:32:16,937
Are you stupid
or something?

1229
01:32:16,970 --> 01:32:19,773
I told you, I want
the governor's daughter!

1230
01:32:19,806 --> 01:32:22,409
Now, I know
you know where she is.

1231
01:32:22,442 --> 01:32:23,810
So bring her to me.

1232
01:32:23,844 --> 01:32:26,446
Now, if you don't,
you're all gonna die anyway.

1233
01:32:26,480 --> 01:32:28,682
Including this one. Your choice!

1234
01:32:28,715 --> 01:32:30,784
Ah!

1235
01:32:30,817 --> 01:32:32,819
He's gonna do it.

1236
01:32:34,454 --> 01:32:36,890
- Yeah.
- Okay, I'll give her to you.

1237
01:32:36,923 --> 01:32:38,925
Just call off your men,
and you let her go.

1238
01:32:40,794 --> 01:32:43,530
Yeah, two lives for one.

1239
01:32:43,563 --> 01:32:46,633
- I'll go find her.
- Hurry the fuck up!

1240
01:32:50,804 --> 01:32:52,873
- Fuck!
- Get down on the floor!

1241
01:32:52,906 --> 01:32:54,341
Shit.

1242
01:32:54,374 --> 01:32:57,344
- Fuck.
- We wait.

1243
01:33:03,917 --> 01:33:05,352
Asilia?

1244
01:33:14,294 --> 01:33:15,562
Asilia?

1245
01:33:17,764 --> 01:33:18,632
Hey.

1246
01:33:25,605 --> 01:33:27,307
Hey, Asilia.

1247
01:33:27,340 --> 01:33:28,675
I fucking told you
to stay in...

1248
01:33:32,045 --> 01:33:33,613
I killed a man.

1249
01:33:35,816 --> 01:33:37,250
- I fucking...
- Yes.

1250
01:33:37,284 --> 01:33:38,719
- I fucking...
- Okay.

1251
01:33:38,752 --> 01:33:40,554
- I killed a man.
- Yes.

1252
01:33:40,587 --> 01:33:43,290
I know it's hard.

1253
01:33:43,323 --> 01:33:45,525
Just...
we can finish this.

1254
01:33:46,893 --> 01:33:49,197
But I need you to listen.
I need you to be strong.

1255
01:33:50,030 --> 01:33:52,032
I have a plan, okay?

1256
01:33:52,065 --> 01:33:53,600
Where is she?

1257
01:33:53,633 --> 01:33:55,001
This way, come on.

1258
01:34:13,920 --> 01:34:16,556
Fuck me.

1259
01:34:25,832 --> 01:34:28,034
Well? Where is she?

1260
01:34:29,836 --> 01:34:32,939
She's in the barn. You can take
her easily,

1261
01:34:32,973 --> 01:34:35,609
and that way she won't
know that it was me.

1262
01:34:37,544 --> 01:34:39,946
Why do you care so much
about what she thinks of you?

1263
01:34:43,117 --> 01:34:45,452
Because I promised her
I would keep her safe.

1264
01:34:45,485 --> 01:34:49,055
Oh, yeah? Well, you lied.
Now lead the way.

1265
01:34:50,090 --> 01:34:52,359
- Get up!
- Tess, come on.

1266
01:34:53,460 --> 01:34:54,661
Come on!

1267
01:35:00,467 --> 01:35:02,502
Why's she so valuable
to you, anyway?

1268
01:35:02,536 --> 01:35:03,970
Her father's never
gonna give you power.

1269
01:35:04,004 --> 01:35:05,739
It doesn't matter
what you do to her.

1270
01:35:05,772 --> 01:35:07,641
I want what's owed to me.

1271
01:35:09,442 --> 01:35:11,444
Okay, so what about
the Caliphate?

1272
01:35:11,478 --> 01:35:14,481
Caliphate?
There is no Caliphate.

1273
01:35:14,514 --> 01:35:16,082
It's about
what it's always about.

1274
01:35:16,117 --> 01:35:17,551
It's about money.

1275
01:35:17,584 --> 01:35:19,352
Her father stole...
don't look at me!

1276
01:35:19,386 --> 01:35:21,588
Her father stole from me!
He owes me.

1277
01:35:21,621 --> 01:35:23,890
Okay. So this was
all an act.

1278
01:35:23,924 --> 01:35:25,659
Would you prefer
if I was some zealot?

1279
01:35:25,692 --> 01:35:28,028
That's for fools, man.

1280
01:35:28,061 --> 01:35:31,631
Her father deals in the exact
same ivory trade as we do.

1281
01:35:31,665 --> 01:35:35,869
Lion parts, rhino horns.
Even this place, he owns it.

1282
01:35:35,902 --> 01:35:37,104
Part of his business...

1283
01:35:37,138 --> 01:35:39,072
breeding lions
to shoot for profit.

1284
01:35:39,106 --> 01:35:41,575
No, her father's
a conservationist.

1285
01:35:41,608 --> 01:35:42,909
Oh, yeah,
of course, he is.

1286
01:35:42,943 --> 01:35:44,377
It's a great cover story,
innit?

1287
01:35:44,411 --> 01:35:47,047
The fact is,
everything has a value...

1288
01:35:47,080 --> 01:35:50,550
animals, humans.

1289
01:35:50,584 --> 01:35:52,819
He has the highest kill count
in the whole of the country,

1290
01:35:52,853 --> 01:35:53,987
and he plays dirty.

1291
01:35:54,020 --> 01:35:56,623
But don't worry,
I can play dirty, too.

1292
01:35:56,656 --> 01:35:57,891
- You get me?
- Yeah, okay.

1293
01:35:57,924 --> 01:35:59,793
She's in there.
I told her to hide.

1294
01:35:59,826 --> 01:36:01,661
You can just go in and make
it look like you found her.

1295
01:36:01,695 --> 01:36:03,997
Are you trying to take me for
some dickhead or something?

1296
01:36:04,030 --> 01:36:06,700
You think I'm dumb,
going in there alone?

1297
01:36:06,733 --> 01:36:08,501
You first.

1298
01:36:10,737 --> 01:36:12,639
Let Tess go.

1299
01:36:13,974 --> 01:36:16,177
You don't need her.

1300
01:36:16,210 --> 01:36:18,511
- Go on. Get out of here.
- Go.

1301
01:36:19,779 --> 01:36:20,947
Lead the way.

1302
01:36:23,150 --> 01:36:25,785
You can
come out now, Asilia.

1303
01:36:32,492 --> 01:36:34,060
So where is she?

1304
01:36:34,094 --> 01:36:34,961
Run, now.

1305
01:36:41,034 --> 01:36:43,204
Hey, girls.

1306
01:36:43,237 --> 01:36:44,671
Look what I found.

1307
01:36:46,207 --> 01:36:47,908
What, you think
that scares me?

1308
01:36:47,941 --> 01:36:49,976
I told you, I'm fucking
bad man out here.

1309
01:36:50,010 --> 01:36:51,978
I've got the gun.
I've got the power.

1310
01:36:52,012 --> 01:36:54,614
Actually, I don't think
either of us do.

1311
01:37:08,495 --> 01:37:10,164
So now <i>you</i> have a choice.

1312
01:37:12,166 --> 01:37:14,601
Which bitch is gonna kill you?

1313
01:37:17,704 --> 01:37:19,606
I swear one of us will.

1314
01:37:20,774 --> 01:37:22,209
Well, then,
you die first.

1315
01:38:11,992 --> 01:38:14,894
All hail the queen.

1316
01:38:22,902 --> 01:38:24,105
Put it down, Tess.
Put it down.

1317
01:38:33,880 --> 01:38:35,749
Yeah. Go, ho-ho.

1318
01:38:49,763 --> 01:38:50,964
Oh, my God.

1319
01:38:59,639 --> 01:39:01,741
All she wanted
was to protect her cubs.

1320
01:39:04,044 --> 01:39:06,079
And that's why she stayed behind
and the rest of them left.

1321
01:39:08,349 --> 01:39:10,284
She reminds me
of someone I know.

1322
01:39:13,620 --> 01:39:14,988
Hey, what am I,
chopped liver?

1323
01:39:15,021 --> 01:39:16,823
Hey, you did okay.

1324
01:39:16,856 --> 01:39:18,359
- I mean, for a guy.
- Yeah, yeah.

1325
01:39:18,392 --> 01:39:20,327
- Or did you want a hug?
- No, no.

1326
01:39:20,361 --> 01:39:22,896
- Maybe you do.
- Oh, oh. I got issues. Oh.

1327
01:39:26,032 --> 01:39:28,001
Ooh.

1328
01:39:28,034 --> 01:39:29,636
Oh, that hurt. Ow.

1329
01:40:18,589 --> 01:40:23,589
