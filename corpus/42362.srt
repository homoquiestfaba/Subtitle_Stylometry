1
00:00:30,129 --> 00:00:33,326

2
00:00:53,352 --> 00:00:54,876

3
00:02:06,759 --> 00:02:09,159

4
00:02:25,274 --> 00:02:26,536

5
00:02:36,619 --> 00:02:38,450

6
00:03:00,643 --> 00:03:03,305

7
00:03:12,054 --> 00:03:14,921

8
00:03:19,395 --> 00:03:22,159

9
00:03:22,231 --> 00:03:25,064

10
00:03:28,270 --> 00:03:29,396
Where are they?

11
00:03:29,471 --> 00:03:30,495
I don't know.

12
00:03:30,573 --> 00:03:32,006
<i>Morgan: Dad!</i>

13
00:03:32,074 --> 00:03:34,065
<i>Uncle Merrill!</i>

14
00:03:34,143 --> 00:03:36,805
<i>Dad!</i>

15
00:03:40,816 --> 00:03:42,306
Morgan!

16
00:03:48,057 --> 00:03:50,525

17
00:03:50,593 --> 00:03:52,823

18
00:03:54,263 --> 00:03:55,696
Bo? Bo?

19
00:03:55,764 --> 00:03:57,891
Bo, where's Morgan?

20
00:03:57,967 --> 00:03:58,956
Bo?

21
00:03:59,034 --> 00:04:01,161
Are you in my dream,
too?

22
00:04:01,236 --> 00:04:03,602
-- This is not a dr--
<i>Dad!</i>

23
00:04:03,672 --> 00:04:05,003
Hey...

24
00:04:05,074 --> 00:04:06,632
Honey...

25
00:04:09,178 --> 00:04:10,440

26
00:04:10,512 --> 00:04:13,345
<i>Morgan?</i>
<i>What's happening?</i>

27
00:04:13,415 --> 00:04:16,213
The dogs were barking --
woke us up.

28
00:04:16,285 --> 00:04:18,412

29
00:04:18,487 --> 00:04:20,250
Are you hurt?

30
00:04:20,322 --> 00:04:23,519
I think God did it.

31
00:04:23,592 --> 00:04:25,856
Did what, Morgan?

32
00:04:30,099 --> 00:04:37,096

33
00:05:00,262 --> 00:05:02,253

34
00:05:44,173 --> 00:05:47,142
<i>Look, Lee, I don't even care</i>
<i>if it was him.</i>

35
00:05:47,209 --> 00:05:49,769
And you can just have
a word with him,

36
00:05:49,845 --> 00:05:51,836
and that'd be enough for me.

37
00:05:51,914 --> 00:05:55,873
See, it was strange
finding the crops that way.

38
00:05:55,951 --> 00:05:58,317
The kids were confused by it,

39
00:05:58,387 --> 00:06:00,685
and, uh, it'd sure take
the strangeness away

40
00:06:00,756 --> 00:06:04,453
if I knew it was just
Lionel and the Wolfington
brothers messing around,

41
00:06:04,526 --> 00:06:05,720
that's all.

42
00:06:07,229 --> 00:06:09,390
At the movies?

43
00:06:09,465 --> 00:06:12,161
Are you sure?

44
00:06:12,234 --> 00:06:14,031
All right, then.

45
00:06:14,103 --> 00:06:16,071
Uh, thanks for
your patience, Lee.

46
00:06:16,138 --> 00:06:17,662
Yeah. Bye.

47
00:06:17,740 --> 00:06:19,731

48
00:06:22,077 --> 00:06:26,275
Houdini peed.
I think he's sick.

49
00:06:26,348 --> 00:06:29,283
Why don't you take him outside?
I'll call Dr. Crawford.

50
00:06:29,351 --> 00:06:31,012
He doesn't treat animals.

51
00:06:31,086 --> 00:06:33,111
Well, he'll know
what to do.

52
00:06:33,188 --> 00:06:36,555

53
00:06:36,625 --> 00:06:41,460

54
00:06:49,438 --> 00:06:50,996
Oh. That was quick,
Caroline.

55
00:06:51,073 --> 00:06:53,041
I only called you folks
two hours ago.

56
00:06:53,108 --> 00:06:55,668
Old Mrs. Kendleman
twisted her ankle,

57
00:06:55,744 --> 00:06:58,235
as she puts it,
diving for her life

58
00:06:58,313 --> 00:07:02,613
when a bunch of school kids
rode down the sidewalk
on skateboards.

59
00:07:02,684 --> 00:07:05,710
She went down to Thornton's
store this morning

60
00:07:05,788 --> 00:07:09,087
and started spitting
on the new skateboards.

61
00:07:09,158 --> 00:07:10,716
Spitting!

62
00:07:10,793 --> 00:07:12,283
By the time I got there,

63
00:07:12,361 --> 00:07:15,421
Mrs. Kendleman had sprayed
the whole damned place.

64
00:07:15,497 --> 00:07:18,159
And she must have had
a cold or something.

65
00:07:18,233 --> 00:07:21,896
I'm telling you,
I won't eat for a week.

66
00:07:21,970 --> 00:07:24,302

67
00:07:24,373 --> 00:07:27,672
So, what happened
to your crops?

68
00:07:27,743 --> 00:07:27,879

69
00:07:27,879 --> 00:07:31,178

70
00:07:31,249 --> 00:07:34,184
Dad's gonna burn these
again.

71
00:07:42,427 --> 00:07:44,395
It's contaminated.

72
00:07:44,463 --> 00:07:46,761
You don't even know
what that word means.

73
00:07:49,201 --> 00:07:50,930
It's not contaminated.

74
00:07:51,003 --> 00:07:54,029
It's just tap water.
Pour it in his bowl.

75
00:07:54,106 --> 00:07:55,471
It tastes funny.

76
00:07:55,540 --> 00:07:56,768
It does not.

77
00:07:56,842 --> 00:07:58,810
And besides, he licks
his butt every day.

78
00:07:58,877 --> 00:08:00,538
I don't think he'll mind.

79
00:08:14,059 --> 00:08:15,686

80
00:08:15,761 --> 00:08:17,524

81
00:08:17,596 --> 00:08:19,860
Houdini?

82
00:08:19,931 --> 00:08:22,456
Bo, don't run.

83
00:08:22,534 --> 00:08:23,831
What's wrong, boy?

84
00:08:23,902 --> 00:08:25,392

85
00:08:25,470 --> 00:08:26,698
Stop it, Houdini.

86
00:08:26,772 --> 00:08:28,262

87
00:08:28,340 --> 00:08:29,967

88
00:08:30,042 --> 00:08:32,203

89
00:08:32,277 --> 00:08:37,340
<i>Look at where</i>
<i>it's bent over, Father.</i>

90
00:08:37,416 --> 00:08:40,351
<i>It's not broken.</i>

91
00:08:40,419 --> 00:08:45,550
Now, what kind of machine
can bend a stalk of corn
over without breaking it?

92
00:08:45,624 --> 00:08:48,525
Can't be by hand.
It's too perfect.

93
00:08:48,593 --> 00:08:51,585
It doesn't sound much
like Lionel Prichard and
the Wolfington brothers.

94
00:08:51,663 --> 00:08:53,221
They can't take a piss

95
00:08:53,298 --> 00:08:56,290
without wetting
the front of their pants.

96
00:08:56,368 --> 00:08:59,667
I don't think anyone
else around here has
had any problems.

97
00:08:59,738 --> 00:09:02,673
I was over at Theo Henry's
farm yesterday afternoon,

98
00:09:02,741 --> 00:09:04,868
and he would have
mentioned something.

99
00:09:04,943 --> 00:09:07,503
Why were you at Theo's place?

100
00:09:07,579 --> 00:09:11,037
Some animals around the county
have been acting funny --

101
00:09:11,116 --> 00:09:14,517
and some of them violent.

102
00:09:14,586 --> 00:09:16,554
What is it, a virus?

103
00:09:16,621 --> 00:09:19,317
I don't think so, Father.

104
00:09:19,391 --> 00:09:22,724
They're more edgy,
you know, and alert.

105
00:09:22,794 --> 00:09:26,161
It's almost like they
act when they smell
a predator around --

106
00:09:26,231 --> 00:09:28,665
peeing on themselves
and everything.

107
00:09:28,734 --> 00:09:30,224

108
00:09:37,075 --> 00:09:40,909
Caroline...

109
00:09:40,979 --> 00:09:44,312
please stop calling me
"Father".

110
00:09:44,382 --> 00:09:46,646
What's wrong?

111
00:09:46,718 --> 00:09:49,812
I don't hear my children.

112
00:10:14,246 --> 00:10:18,273

113
00:10:18,350 --> 00:10:20,284
He fell on me.

114
00:10:20,352 --> 00:10:23,116
He wanted to kill Bo.

115
00:10:24,856 --> 00:10:29,452

116
00:10:29,528 --> 00:10:32,520

117
00:10:32,597 --> 00:10:35,464

118
00:10:39,538 --> 00:10:41,199
Did he hurt you?

119
00:10:41,273 --> 00:10:43,207
<i>No.</i>

120
00:10:47,879 --> 00:10:50,370
I'm so sorry, Morgan.

121
00:11:10,735 --> 00:11:13,499
Where were you?

122
00:11:13,572 --> 00:11:15,005
Houdini's sick.

123
00:11:15,073 --> 00:11:17,541
Tie Isabel up to the
back of the shed, please,

124
00:11:17,609 --> 00:11:19,975
and make sure
the knot's very tight.

125
00:11:48,206 --> 00:11:51,198

126
00:12:01,416 --> 00:12:04,442

127
00:12:04,519 --> 00:12:06,510
What's the matter?

128
00:12:06,588 --> 00:12:08,818
There's a monster
outside my room.

129
00:12:08,890 --> 00:12:11,757
Can I have a glass of water?

130
00:12:11,826 --> 00:12:15,262
What's wrong with the water
next to your bed?

131
00:12:15,330 --> 00:12:18,299
It tastes old.

132
00:12:28,610 --> 00:12:31,602

133
00:12:33,781 --> 00:12:35,772

134
00:12:50,632 --> 00:12:53,066
What are you thinking about?

135
00:12:55,670 --> 00:13:00,232
Why do you talk to Mom
when you're by yourself?

136
00:13:02,143 --> 00:13:04,941
Makes me feel better.

137
00:13:05,013 --> 00:13:08,449
Does she ever answer back?

138
00:13:12,053 --> 00:13:14,749
No.

139
00:13:16,591 --> 00:13:20,755
She never answers me either.

140
00:13:23,498 --> 00:13:26,399

141
00:13:33,775 --> 00:13:36,243

142
00:13:36,311 --> 00:13:37,778
What?

143
00:13:37,845 --> 00:13:42,373
Lionel Prichard and the
Wolfington brothers are back.

144
00:13:42,450 --> 00:13:44,315
It's time
for an ass-whupping.

145
00:13:44,385 --> 00:13:47,513
This is not an intelligent
way to approach this.

146
00:13:47,589 --> 00:13:50,149
Lee is a friend of mine.
This is his son.

147
00:13:50,224 --> 00:13:52,055
Yeah, we'll be doing Lee
a favor.

148
00:13:52,126 --> 00:13:54,253
All right, listen --
we both go outside,

149
00:13:54,329 --> 00:13:56,729
move around the house
in opposite directions.

150
00:13:56,798 --> 00:13:58,698
We act crazy,
insane with anger --

151
00:13:58,766 --> 00:14:00,461
make them crap in their pants,

152
00:14:00,535 --> 00:14:04,164
force them around till
we meet up on the other side.

153
00:14:04,238 --> 00:14:05,500
Explain "act crazy".

154
00:14:05,573 --> 00:14:07,165
You know, curse and stuff.

155
00:14:07,241 --> 00:14:08,572
You want me to curse?

156
00:14:08,643 --> 00:14:11,077
You don't mean it.
It's just for show.

157
00:14:11,145 --> 00:14:12,112
What?

158
00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:13,738
Well, it won't be convincing.

159
00:14:13,815 --> 00:14:15,749
It doesn't sound natural
when I curse.

160
00:14:15,817 --> 00:14:18,786
Just make noises, then.

161
00:14:18,853 --> 00:14:20,047
Explain "noises".

162
00:14:20,121 --> 00:14:22,521
Are you gonna do this or what?

163
00:14:22,590 --> 00:14:23,818
No, I'm not.

164
00:14:23,891 --> 00:14:26,951
All right, you want
them stealing something
in the house next time?

165
00:14:27,028 --> 00:14:28,791
On the count of three --

166
00:14:28,863 --> 00:14:30,387
-- 1...
-- All right.

167
00:14:30,465 --> 00:14:31,864
2...3!

168
00:14:31,933 --> 00:14:34,333

169
00:14:34,402 --> 00:14:36,893
Aaah!
I'm insane with anger!

170
00:14:36,971 --> 00:14:39,235
We're gonna beat
your ass, bitch!

171
00:14:39,307 --> 00:14:41,571

172
00:14:44,045 --> 00:14:46,639
We're gonna tear
your head off!

173
00:14:46,714 --> 00:14:48,579
I'm losing my mind!

174
00:14:48,650 --> 00:14:50,914

175
00:14:50,985 --> 00:14:52,612
It's time for
an ass-whupping!

176
00:14:52,687 --> 00:14:54,518

177
00:14:54,589 --> 00:14:56,250

178
00:14:58,426 --> 00:14:59,757
I cursed.

179
00:14:59,827 --> 00:15:02,022
I heard.

180
00:15:02,096 --> 00:15:04,621

181
00:15:04,699 --> 00:15:07,793
How did he get...

182
00:15:07,869 --> 00:15:10,201

183
00:15:22,650 --> 00:15:25,312
Are you sure
this is Lionel Prichard?

184
00:15:25,386 --> 00:15:26,614

185
00:15:29,657 --> 00:15:32,558

186
00:15:40,601 --> 00:15:43,001

187
00:15:43,071 --> 00:15:45,403
<i>You like that?</i>

188
00:15:48,776 --> 00:15:51,609
You got an old
baby monitor around?

189
00:15:51,679 --> 00:15:53,579
Bo had an old baby monitor.

190
00:15:53,648 --> 00:15:56,549
You can use Bo's baby monitor
as a walkie-talkie.

191
00:15:56,617 --> 00:15:58,414
-- You can?
-- Mm-hmm.

192
00:15:58,486 --> 00:16:01,148
It only works one way,
but that'll do fine.

193
00:16:01,222 --> 00:16:03,053

194
00:16:03,124 --> 00:16:07,117
That is, until someone gets
you an old walkie-talkie
left over at the station.

195
00:16:07,195 --> 00:16:09,026
<i>Stop! lt's hideous!</i>

196
00:16:09,097 --> 00:16:10,394
<i>Get it off!</i>

197
00:16:10,465 --> 00:16:11,625
I-I know what to do.

198
00:16:11,699 --> 00:16:12,961

199
00:16:13,034 --> 00:16:14,501
Hey, Bo...

200
00:16:14,569 --> 00:16:16,867
turn that down till
Officer Paski leaves.

201
00:16:16,938 --> 00:16:18,098
Doy-da!

202
00:16:18,172 --> 00:16:19,264

203
00:16:19,340 --> 00:16:20,830

204
00:16:20,908 --> 00:16:22,773
You're too old
to still be doing this.

205
00:16:22,844 --> 00:16:25,005
You take a glass of water,
and you finish it.

206
00:16:25,079 --> 00:16:27,070
Now, what's wrong
with this one?

207
00:16:27,148 --> 00:16:29,207
It has dust in it.

208
00:16:29,283 --> 00:16:30,716
This one?

209
00:16:30,785 --> 00:16:32,309
A hair.

210
00:16:32,386 --> 00:16:33,819
This one?

211
00:16:33,888 --> 00:16:37,255
Morgan took a sip, and
it has his amebas in it.

212
00:16:37,325 --> 00:16:39,691
My turn.

213
00:16:41,929 --> 00:16:45,558
So, how are you, Merrill?

214
00:16:45,633 --> 00:16:48,101
Fine.

215
00:16:48,169 --> 00:16:51,468
<i>How is work at</i>
<i>the gas station?</i>

216
00:16:51,539 --> 00:16:53,404
Stimulating.

217
00:16:53,474 --> 00:16:55,442

218
00:16:57,478 --> 00:16:59,912
<i>I never got a chance</i>
<i>to tell you,</i>

219
00:16:59,981 --> 00:17:03,576
but I-I thought your
moving in here with
your brother after --

220
00:17:03,684 --> 00:17:06,209
it was a nice thing to do.

221
00:17:06,254 --> 00:17:09,382
<i>Well, I don't think</i>
<i>I'm helping much.</i>

222
00:17:13,528 --> 00:17:14,995
You are.

223
00:17:33,181 --> 00:17:35,581
Sorry.

224
00:17:35,650 --> 00:17:39,848
Okay, so far I have,
"It was very dark".

225
00:17:39,921 --> 00:17:42,515
Yes, it was.

226
00:17:42,590 --> 00:17:46,617
You can't describe him
at all?

227
00:17:46,694 --> 00:17:49,128
Don't you think
that's kind of odd?

228
00:17:49,197 --> 00:17:51,961
A little.

229
00:17:52,033 --> 00:17:56,265
I don't know whether to look
for a giant or a midget.

230
00:17:56,337 --> 00:17:58,362
No, he definitely
wasn't a midget.

231
00:17:58,439 --> 00:18:00,236
Okay.

232
00:18:00,308 --> 00:18:02,674
So he was tall?

233
00:18:05,012 --> 00:18:07,606
I-I would say so, yes.

234
00:18:07,682 --> 00:18:09,309
Probably.

235
00:18:09,383 --> 00:18:11,613
<i>Over 6 feet?</i>

236
00:18:13,754 --> 00:18:15,278
It was very dark.

237
00:18:15,356 --> 00:18:17,119
Yes, it was.

238
00:18:17,191 --> 00:18:20,388
How certain are you
that this was a male?

239
00:18:20,461 --> 00:18:23,294
Oh, I don't know --
I don't know any girls
who could run like that.

240
00:18:23,364 --> 00:18:24,729
I don't know, Merrill.

241
00:18:24,799 --> 00:18:27,529
I've seen some of those women
on the Olympics.

242
00:18:27,602 --> 00:18:29,627
They can run like the wind.

243
00:18:29,704 --> 00:18:32,264
This guy got on our roof
in, like, a second.

244
00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:34,638
O-Our roof is 10 feet high.

245
00:18:34,709 --> 00:18:37,542
They have women's high jumping
in the Olympics.

246
00:18:37,612 --> 00:18:39,705
They got these
Scandinavian women

247
00:18:39,780 --> 00:18:42,078
who can jump clean over me.

248
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:48,388
Caroline, I know you're
making a point here,

249
00:18:48,456 --> 00:18:50,424
but I just don't know
what it is.

250
00:18:50,491 --> 00:18:53,688
An out-of-town woman stopped by
the diner yesterday afternoon

251
00:18:53,761 --> 00:18:55,524
and started yelling
and cussing

252
00:18:55,596 --> 00:18:58,190
because they didn't have
her favorite cigarettes

253
00:18:58,266 --> 00:19:00,530
at the vending machine.

254
00:19:00,601 --> 00:19:04,970
She scared a couple
of the customers.

255
00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:08,566
No one's seen her since.

256
00:19:08,643 --> 00:19:09,803
And my point is,

257
00:19:09,877 --> 00:19:13,210
we don't know anything
about the person you saw,

258
00:19:13,281 --> 00:19:17,183
and we should just keep
all possibilities available.

259
00:19:17,251 --> 00:19:19,412

260
00:19:19,487 --> 00:19:21,216
Dad, where's the remote?

261
00:19:21,289 --> 00:19:22,722
I don't know, baby.

262
00:19:22,790 --> 00:19:25,850
Why don't you check
in the sofa cushions?

263
00:19:25,927 --> 00:19:27,485
Excluding the possibility

264
00:19:27,561 --> 00:19:29,927
that a female Scandinavian
Olympian

265
00:19:29,997 --> 00:19:33,023
was running around outside
our house last night,

266
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:35,364
what else might be
a possibility?

267
00:19:35,436 --> 00:19:37,597
<i>I'm not done asking</i>
<i>questions,</i>

268
00:19:37,672 --> 00:19:40,197
and I don't appreciate
sarcasm.

269
00:19:42,276 --> 00:19:43,709
<i>Do you two have anyone</i>

270
00:19:43,778 --> 00:19:46,906
<i>who might have a grudge</i>
<i>or something against you --</i>

271
00:19:46,981 --> 00:19:48,972
<i>maybe a-a church member</i>

272
00:19:49,050 --> 00:19:51,143
<i>who -- who might</i>
<i>not have liked</i>

273
00:19:51,218 --> 00:19:53,652
the fact that
you left the church?

274
00:19:56,324 --> 00:19:58,224
I don't think so.

275
00:19:58,292 --> 00:19:59,520
Okay, I was out of line

276
00:19:59,593 --> 00:20:02,255
with the whole female-
Scandinavian-Olympian thing.

277
00:20:02,330 --> 00:20:05,663
<i>It's just,</i>
<i>l'm pretty strong,</i>

278
00:20:05,733 --> 00:20:08,031
and I'm pretty fast.

279
00:20:08,102 --> 00:20:10,627
And I was running
as fast as I could,

280
00:20:10,705 --> 00:20:15,904
and this guy, he was --
he was just toying with us.

281
00:20:15,977 --> 00:20:18,343
There's only food
under the sofa.

282
00:20:18,412 --> 00:20:19,743
Baby, why don't you

283
00:20:19,814 --> 00:20:22,374
just change the channel
on the television?

284
00:20:22,450 --> 00:20:23,815
I did.

285
00:20:23,884 --> 00:20:25,010
And?

286
00:20:25,086 --> 00:20:29,022
Same show's on every station.

287
00:20:29,090 --> 00:20:32,856
<i>Every station?</i>

288
00:20:35,629 --> 00:20:41,659
<i>Graham:</i>
<i>Bo, turn up the volume.</i>

289
00:20:41,735 --> 00:20:44,169
Crop signs first emerged
in the late '70s

290
00:20:44,238 --> 00:20:47,002
with renewed interest
in extraterrestrial life.

291
00:20:47,074 --> 00:20:49,838
They died out
by the early '80s,

292
00:20:49,910 --> 00:20:51,810
dismissed as hoaxes.

293
00:20:51,879 --> 00:20:55,679
This new resurgence
is wholly different.

294
00:20:55,749 --> 00:20:58,377
<i>The speed and the quantity</i>
<i>in which it has appeared</i>

295
00:20:58,452 --> 00:21:01,580
<i>implies the coordination</i>
<i>of hundreds of individuals</i>

296
00:21:01,655 --> 00:21:03,418
<i>over many countries.</i>

297
00:21:03,490 --> 00:21:06,721

298
00:21:06,794 --> 00:21:10,525
<i>There are only a limited</i>
<i>number of explanations.</i>

299
00:21:10,598 --> 00:21:15,194
<i>Either this is one</i>
<i>of the most elaborate</i>
<i>hoaxes ever created,</i>

300
00:21:15,269 --> 00:21:18,636
<i>or basically...</i>

301
00:21:18,706 --> 00:21:21,402
<i>it's for real.</i>

302
00:21:24,311 --> 00:21:26,939

303
00:21:27,014 --> 00:21:30,450
Extraterrestrials.

304
00:21:30,517 --> 00:21:35,284
What in God's name
is going on?

305
00:21:35,356 --> 00:21:38,848
I did some research
after I saw your crops.

306
00:21:38,926 --> 00:21:43,022
Two or three guys can make
a design the size of the
one in your field overnight

307
00:21:43,097 --> 00:21:44,997
using just boards and ropes.

308
00:21:45,065 --> 00:21:46,327
Really?

309
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:50,097
That's how these things
have been done in the past.

310
00:21:50,170 --> 00:21:53,003
But there are so many now.

311
00:21:53,073 --> 00:21:56,873
How could so many people
be in on it?

312
00:21:59,146 --> 00:22:00,272
I can't think straight.

313
00:22:00,347 --> 00:22:02,315
I'm -- I'm gonna go back
to the station

314
00:22:02,383 --> 00:22:05,511
and have a cup of
Edgar's coffee and --
and try to think clear.

315
00:22:05,586 --> 00:22:06,917
And after that, I'll...

316
00:22:06,987 --> 00:22:09,421
I might make some calls.

317
00:22:09,490 --> 00:22:12,926
But I'll tell you
something -- what I said
in there, it still goes.

318
00:22:12,993 --> 00:22:15,484
Your -- your family
has been through a lot.

319
00:22:15,562 --> 00:22:18,156
And the last thing
these children need to do

320
00:22:18,232 --> 00:22:21,827
is worry about some crazy
things happening in the world.

321
00:22:21,902 --> 00:22:23,494
Now, take them into town

322
00:22:23,570 --> 00:22:27,529
and get their minds
and your mind on
everyday things, hmm?

323
00:22:27,608 --> 00:22:29,337
Good medicine.

324
00:22:29,410 --> 00:22:32,470
That's good advice.

325
00:22:35,015 --> 00:22:38,280
And you take care
of yourself...

326
00:22:38,352 --> 00:22:41,150
Graham.

327
00:22:41,221 --> 00:22:43,314

328
00:22:50,264 --> 00:22:53,665
<i>The footage you're watching</i>
<i>was shot yesterday afternoon</i>

333
00:23:06,814 --> 00:23:09,544
Uncle Merrill, will you
turn on the radio?

334
00:23:11,485 --> 00:23:14,943
<i>Woman on radio:</i>

336
00:23:16,724 --> 00:23:21,184
No radio either.
Just for a while.

337
00:23:21,261 --> 00:23:25,095

338
00:23:37,778 --> 00:23:40,144

00:23:48,288 --> 00:23:50,620
<i>Book money?</i>

340
00:23:50,691 --> 00:23:52,352
Sure.

<i>Just one.</i>

342
00:24:05,372 --> 00:24:08,398

344
00:24:15,382 --> 00:24:19,113
<i>They're trying to sell sodas.</i>
<i>It's plain and simple.</i>

345
00:24:19,186 --> 00:24:21,381
Been watching these reports
since morning.

346
00:24:21,455 --> 00:24:24,015
I have seen 12 soda
commercials so far --

347
00:24:24,091 --> 00:24:25,752
12!

348
00:24:25,826 --> 00:24:29,091
You have any books
on extraterrestrials?

349
00:24:29,163 --> 00:24:31,791
Now, don't tell me you believe
this horse manure.

350
00:24:31,865 --> 00:24:34,095
As a matter of fact,
I think we have one.

351
00:24:34,168 --> 00:24:35,999
Came by mistake
in a shipment --

352
00:24:36,069 --> 00:24:38,230
decided to keep it
for the city people.

353
00:24:38,305 --> 00:24:42,332
Last row, third book
on the left, honey.

354
00:24:42,409 --> 00:24:44,809
<i>Why is no one</i>
<i>saying the obvious?</i>

355
00:24:44,878 --> 00:24:47,108

<i>Someone somewhere does</i>

<i>It was asthma medicine,</i>
<i>right, Father?</i>

358
00:24:53,387 --> 00:24:54,979
For Morgan Hess.

359
00:24:55,055 --> 00:24:57,421
And it's not "Father"
anymore.

360
00:24:57,491 --> 00:25:00,858
<i>In less than an hour,</i>

<i>the verge of mass hysteria.</i>

362
00:25:10,771 --> 00:25:13,331
Can I ask you a favor,

363
00:25:13,407 --> 00:25:15,898

00:25:18,212 --> 00:25:23,013
Tracey...I am not
a reverend anymore.

366
00:25:23,083 --> 00:25:25,813
I haven't been
for six months.

367
00:25:25,886 --> 00:25:28,013
You know this.

368
00:25:28,088 --> 00:25:30,556
All this stuff on TV --

369
00:25:30,624 --> 00:25:33,525
two girls came in here
talking about the end
of the world --

370
00:25:33,594 --> 00:25:36,825
<i>I'm just a little scared.</i>

371
00:25:36,897 --> 00:25:41,197
Please, I need to clear
my conscience.

372
00:25:48,108 --> 00:25:50,804
<i>I've got it figured.</i>

373
00:25:54,147 --> 00:25:55,171
You do?

374
00:25:55,248 --> 00:25:57,045
I've had two separate
folks tell me

375
00:25:57,117 --> 00:26:00,348
there have been strangers
around these parts
last couple nights.

376
00:26:00,420 --> 00:26:02,650
Can't tell what they look like

377
00:26:02,722 --> 00:26:06,249
'cause they're staying
in the shadows -- covertlike.

378
00:26:06,326 --> 00:26:08,317
Nobody's been hurt, mind you.

379
00:26:08,395 --> 00:26:10,488
And that's the giveaway.

380
00:26:10,563 --> 00:26:12,030
I see.

381
00:26:12,098 --> 00:26:13,929
<i>It's called "probing".</i>

382
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,093
<i>It's a military procedure.</i>

383
00:26:16,169 --> 00:26:18,069
You send out a
reconnaissance group --

384
00:26:18,138 --> 00:26:20,504
very small --
to check things out.

385
00:26:20,573 --> 00:26:24,771
Not to engage but
to evaluate the situation --

386
00:26:24,844 --> 00:26:27,711
evaluate the level of danger,

387
00:26:27,781 --> 00:26:30,841
make sure things
are all clear.

388
00:26:30,917 --> 00:26:34,045
Clear for what?

389
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:37,021
For the rest of them.

390
00:26:40,527 --> 00:26:42,256
Yeah?

391
00:26:42,329 --> 00:26:45,298
You got a pamphlet or
something I can read?

392
00:26:45,365 --> 00:26:48,266
Sure.

393
00:26:48,335 --> 00:26:50,496
Thanks.

394
00:26:50,570 --> 00:26:54,939
<i>You didn't used to play</i>
<i>baseball, did ya?</i>

395
00:26:55,008 --> 00:26:57,636
Shit, I know you.
You're Merrill Hess.

396
00:26:57,711 --> 00:27:00,680
I was there the day
you hit that 507-footer

397
00:27:00,747 --> 00:27:03,614
over the left-field wall --
set the record.

398
00:27:03,683 --> 00:27:06,208
Man, that thing had
a motor on it.

399
00:27:06,286 --> 00:27:08,481
It's still the record, right?

400
00:27:08,555 --> 00:27:12,958
Got the bat at home
o-on the wall.

401
00:27:13,026 --> 00:27:15,893
You've got two minor-league
home-run records, don't ya?

402
00:27:15,962 --> 00:27:18,362
Five.

403
00:27:18,465 --> 00:27:20,831
Why weren't you in the pros
making stacks of cash

404
00:27:20,900 --> 00:27:23,232
and getting your toes licked
by beautiful women?

405
00:27:23,303 --> 00:27:26,932
<i>'Cause he has another</i>
<i>record most people</i>
<i>don't know about.</i>

406
00:27:27,007 --> 00:27:29,669
<i>He has the minor-league</i>
<i>strikeout record.</i>

407
00:27:32,078 --> 00:27:33,978
Hello, Lionel.

408
00:27:34,047 --> 00:27:36,538
Merrill's a class-A screw-up.

409
00:27:36,616 --> 00:27:39,608
He would just swing
that bat as hard as
he could every time.

410
00:27:39,686 --> 00:27:41,483
Didn't matter what
the coaches said,

411
00:27:41,554 --> 00:27:42,953
didn't matter who was on base.

412
00:27:43,023 --> 00:27:46,186
He would just whip that
bat through the air
as hard as he could.

413
00:27:46,259 --> 00:27:49,558
Looked like a lumberjack
chopping down a tree.

414
00:27:49,629 --> 00:27:53,656
Merrill here has
more strikeouts than
any two players.

415
00:27:53,733 --> 00:27:56,497
You really got
the strikeout record?

416
00:28:03,410 --> 00:28:07,176
Felt wrong not to swing.

417
00:28:18,691 --> 00:28:20,625
It's contaminated.

418
00:28:20,693 --> 00:28:23,594
Carl, there's something wrong
with our water.

419
00:28:23,663 --> 00:28:26,223
Your water's fine.

420
00:28:26,299 --> 00:28:28,961
Bo has this thing
about her drinking water.

421
00:28:29,035 --> 00:28:30,593
She had it her whole life.

422
00:28:30,670 --> 00:28:34,367
It's like a tick
people have, except
it's not a tick.

423
00:28:34,441 --> 00:28:37,410
Is that right?

424
00:28:37,477 --> 00:28:39,411
<i>13!</i>

425
00:28:39,479 --> 00:28:41,572
<i>## Don't give me</i>
<i>that so-so-soda ##</i>

426
00:28:41,648 --> 00:28:42,910
<i>## That same old cola ##</i>

427
00:28:42,982 --> 00:28:44,472
<i>## I wanna pop ##</i>

428
00:28:44,551 --> 00:28:47,247
-- <i>## Pop, pop</i>
<i>I wanna... Shasta ##</i>
-- I'll take it.

429
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:50,483
<i>I cursed</i>
<i>37 times last week.</i>

430
00:28:50,557 --> 00:28:55,551
I said the "F" word
a couple times, but
mostly..."shits"

431
00:28:55,628 --> 00:29:00,497
and..."bastards".

432
00:29:00,567 --> 00:29:03,001
Is "douche bag" a curse?

433
00:29:03,069 --> 00:29:06,402
I suppose that would
depend on its usage.

434
00:29:06,473 --> 00:29:09,271
How about, "John,
you're a douche bag
for kissing Barbara"?

435
00:29:09,342 --> 00:29:12,243
It's a curse.

436
00:29:12,312 --> 00:29:17,249
Then it's not 37.
It's 71.

437
00:29:20,950 --> 00:29:22,144
Pharmacy crowded?

438
00:29:22,218 --> 00:29:23,845
I don't want any one of you

439
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:26,252
spending time with
Tracey Abernathy alone.

440
00:29:26,322 --> 00:29:28,085
Is that understood?

441
00:29:29,759 --> 00:29:32,626

442
00:29:47,376 --> 00:29:49,571
Is that him?

443
00:29:54,283 --> 00:29:56,547
Yeah.

444
00:30:15,705 --> 00:30:17,730

445
00:30:17,807 --> 00:30:20,708
Who is he?

446
00:30:20,776 --> 00:30:23,745

447
00:30:32,855 --> 00:30:35,915

448
00:30:35,992 --> 00:30:40,224

449
00:30:40,296 --> 00:30:40,416

450
00:30:40,416 --> 00:30:42,850

451
00:30:46,055 --> 00:30:50,048

452
00:30:52,761 --> 00:30:55,286
<i>What is it?</i>

453
00:30:55,364 --> 00:30:58,162
<i>It's Bo's baby monitor.</i>

454
00:30:58,233 --> 00:30:59,928
I found it in the basement.

455
00:31:00,002 --> 00:31:02,493
I'm gonna use it
as a walkie-talkie.

456
00:31:05,708 --> 00:31:08,006

457
00:31:08,077 --> 00:31:11,137
What if it's catching
a signal from them?

458
00:31:14,049 --> 00:31:15,482
It's not.

459
00:31:15,551 --> 00:31:16,916
But it wasn't working.

460
00:31:16,985 --> 00:31:19,351
Morgan, this crop stuff
is about a bunch of nerds

461
00:31:19,421 --> 00:31:21,480
who never had a girlfriend
in their lives.

462
00:31:21,557 --> 00:31:24,048
They're, like, 30, and
they work up little
codes together,

463
00:31:24,126 --> 00:31:27,186
and they analyze Greek
mythology and make up
secret societies

464
00:31:27,262 --> 00:31:30,322
where other guys who
never had girlfriends
before can join in.

465
00:31:30,399 --> 00:31:32,799
They do stupid crap
like this to feel special.

466
00:31:32,868 --> 00:31:34,028
It's a scam.

467
00:31:34,103 --> 00:31:35,832
Nerds were doing it
25 years ago,

468
00:31:35,904 --> 00:31:38,099
and new nerds
are doing it again.

469
00:31:41,577 --> 00:31:44,978
It's just static, Morgan,
all right.

470
00:31:45,047 --> 00:31:46,571
Turn it up. See.

471
00:31:46,648 --> 00:31:48,479

472
00:31:48,550 --> 00:31:50,450

473
00:31:50,519 --> 00:31:51,952
It's a code.

474
00:31:52,020 --> 00:31:54,420
Why can't they get
girlfriends?

475
00:31:54,490 --> 00:31:56,583
Can I see that, please?

476
00:31:56,658 --> 00:31:59,126

477
00:32:04,166 --> 00:32:07,033
lt's noise.

478
00:32:07,102 --> 00:32:09,935
It's broken, Morgan.
It's just gonna keep
doing this.

479
00:32:10,005 --> 00:32:11,495
Maybe some new batteries...

480
00:32:11,573 --> 00:32:13,734
<i>We might lose the signal.</i>

481
00:32:13,809 --> 00:32:16,209
This is exactly
what the nerds want.

482
00:32:18,380 --> 00:32:20,280
I'm getting out now.

483
00:32:21,283 --> 00:32:25,447

484
00:32:27,022 --> 00:32:28,717
Nobody move.

485
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:34,386
Voices.
Did you hear that?

486
00:32:34,463 --> 00:32:36,055
Not English, though.

487
00:32:36,131 --> 00:32:38,463
You heard the voices,
right, Uncle Merrill?

488
00:32:41,203 --> 00:32:43,831
I heard them, Morgan.

489
00:32:43,906 --> 00:32:48,673

490
00:32:48,744 --> 00:32:52,077
Probably picking up
another baby monitor.

491
00:32:52,147 --> 00:32:54,308
That's right.

492
00:32:56,919 --> 00:33:00,320

493
00:33:00,389 --> 00:33:02,289
Let me see it.

494
00:33:02,357 --> 00:33:04,086

495
00:33:04,159 --> 00:33:06,024
Stop!

496
00:33:06,094 --> 00:33:10,531

497
00:33:10,599 --> 00:33:12,658

498
00:33:14,603 --> 00:33:18,835
See, this is why
we're not watching TV.

499
00:33:18,907 --> 00:33:21,068
People get obsessed.

500
00:33:21,143 --> 00:33:22,303
I'm letting go now.

501
00:33:22,377 --> 00:33:23,309
<i>No, Dad!</i>

502
00:33:23,378 --> 00:33:24,470
<i>Don't do it!</i>

503
00:33:24,546 --> 00:33:26,173
You'll lose the signal.

504
00:33:28,217 --> 00:33:29,980
Don't let go.

505
00:33:31,587 --> 00:33:34,556
<i>It gets clearer</i>
<i>the higher you hold it.</i>

506
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:40,624
<i>I got it.</i>

507
00:33:41,997 --> 00:33:45,433
Bo, honey, I don't want
you climbing on the car.

508
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:46,660
Come here.

509
00:33:46,735 --> 00:33:51,297

510
00:33:51,373 --> 00:33:54,501

511
00:33:58,614 --> 00:34:00,138

512
00:34:00,215 --> 00:34:01,705
Stop!

513
00:34:03,485 --> 00:34:05,749
There's two of them talking.

514
00:34:05,821 --> 00:34:10,087

515
00:34:19,334 --> 00:34:23,270

516
00:34:23,338 --> 00:34:25,533

517
00:34:30,279 --> 00:34:32,304

518
00:34:32,381 --> 00:34:37,444

519
00:34:37,519 --> 00:34:40,511

520
00:34:49,498 --> 00:34:50,988

521
00:35:03,812 --> 00:35:05,404

522
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:06,970

523
00:35:09,351 --> 00:35:12,548

524
00:35:12,621 --> 00:35:15,454

525
00:35:15,524 --> 00:35:18,550
Isabel, you're gonna
feel very silly

526
00:35:18,627 --> 00:35:22,495
when this turns out to be
all just make-believe.

527
00:35:22,564 --> 00:35:22,764

528
00:35:22,764 --> 00:35:25,062

529
00:35:25,133 --> 00:35:27,158

530
00:35:35,944 --> 00:35:39,175

531
00:36:10,178 --> 00:36:12,476

532
00:36:21,089 --> 00:36:23,353

533
00:36:59,261 --> 00:37:04,255
You're wasting your time here!

534
00:37:04,332 --> 00:37:07,927
I'm not gonna report this or
anything you do to my crops

535
00:37:08,003 --> 00:37:10,631
to the news or TV or anybody!

536
00:37:12,674 --> 00:37:16,041
You're not going to get famous!

537
00:37:50,345 --> 00:37:52,404

538
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:53,469

539
00:37:55,283 --> 00:37:56,944

540
00:37:57,018 --> 00:37:58,952

541
00:38:14,269 --> 00:38:15,736

542
00:38:15,804 --> 00:38:17,669

543
00:38:20,875 --> 00:38:23,036

544
00:38:35,890 --> 00:38:38,791

545
00:38:38,860 --> 00:38:40,555

546
00:39:22,771 --> 00:39:25,763

547
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:28,502
Okay.

548
00:39:28,576 --> 00:39:31,067
Let's turn on the TV.

549
00:39:33,074 --> 00:39:34,803

550
00:39:34,875 --> 00:39:39,141
<i>It first</i>
<i>appeared 52 minutes ago.</i>

551
00:39:39,213 --> 00:39:42,910
<i>Mexico City officials</i>

<i>air force.</i>

554
00:39:47,121 --> 00:39:50,852
<i>The first sighting was made</i>
<i>by an Air Mexico 747</i>

555
00:39:50,925 --> 00:39:53,758
<i>en route from Mazatlán</i>
<i>to New York</i>

556
00:39:53,828 --> 00:39:58,060
<i>as the unidentified crafts</i>
<i>entered Mexico City air space.</i>

557
00:39:58,132 --> 00:40:02,228
<i>They were not detected by</i>
<i>radar by either country.</i>

558
00:40:02,303 --> 00:40:04,237
The nerds were right.

559
00:40:04,305 --> 00:40:06,398
We have to tape this.

560
00:40:10,277 --> 00:40:12,302
My ballet recital.

561
00:40:12,380 --> 00:40:14,678
Listen, Bo, this
is very important.

562
00:40:14,749 --> 00:40:19,277
Everything people have written
about in science books
is going to change.

563
00:40:19,353 --> 00:40:22,720
The history of the world's
future is on the TV right now.

564
00:40:22,790 --> 00:40:25,884
We need to record this
so you can show <i>your</i>
children this tape

565
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:28,121
and say you were there.

566
00:40:28,195 --> 00:40:29,890
For your children, Bo.

567
00:40:29,964 --> 00:40:31,397
My ballet recital.

568
00:40:31,465 --> 00:40:32,397
Dad!

569
00:40:32,466 --> 00:40:34,127
Find another tape.

570
00:40:34,201 --> 00:40:36,294

571
00:40:36,370 --> 00:40:38,099

572
00:40:38,172 --> 00:40:40,936
Uncle Merrill,
I'm using your tape.

573
00:40:44,779 --> 00:40:47,304
<i>You are seeing a live feed</i>

574
00:40:47,381 --> 00:40:50,350
<i>from our affiliate</i>
<i>down here in Mexico City.</i>

575
00:40:50,418 --> 00:40:55,048
<i>This image has not been</i>
<i>adjusted or enhanced</i>
<i>in any way.</i>

576
00:40:55,122 --> 00:40:57,215
<i>What you're seeing is real.</i>

577
00:40:57,291 --> 00:40:58,781
<i>It's unbelievable.</i>

578
00:40:58,859 --> 00:41:01,384
<i>Everything they wrote</i>
<i>in science books</i>

579
00:41:01,462 --> 00:41:02,554
<i>is about to change.</i>

580
00:41:02,630 --> 00:41:04,120
I told you.

581
00:41:05,633 --> 00:41:08,602

582
00:41:20,147 --> 00:41:22,411
Some people
are probably thinking

583
00:41:22,483 --> 00:41:24,314
this is the end of the world.

584
00:41:24,385 --> 00:41:26,979
That's true.

585
00:41:27,054 --> 00:41:29,818
Do you think it could be?

586
00:41:29,890 --> 00:41:32,484
Yes.

587
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:34,619
How can you say that?

588
00:41:36,797 --> 00:41:39,425
That wasn't
the answer you wanted?

589
00:41:42,203 --> 00:41:45,434
Couldn't you pretend to be
like you used to be?

590
00:41:45,506 --> 00:41:48,270
Give me some comfort.

591
00:41:51,579 --> 00:41:56,414
People break down
into two groups

592
00:41:56,484 --> 00:41:59,419
when they experience
something lucky.

593
00:41:59,487 --> 00:42:03,287
Group number one sees
it as more than luck,

594
00:42:03,357 --> 00:42:05,257
more than coincidence.

595
00:42:05,326 --> 00:42:08,159
They see it as a sign --

596
00:42:08,229 --> 00:42:11,255
evidence that there
is someone up there

597
00:42:11,332 --> 00:42:13,926
watching out for them.

598
00:42:14,001 --> 00:42:18,131
Group number two sees
it as just pure luck,

599
00:42:18,205 --> 00:42:20,696
a happy turn of chance.

600
00:42:20,774 --> 00:42:23,072
I'm sure the people
in group number two

601
00:42:23,144 --> 00:42:26,477
are looking at those
14 lights in a very
suspicious way.

602
00:42:26,547 --> 00:42:30,711
For them, the situation
isn't 50-50.

603
00:42:30,784 --> 00:42:35,016
Could be bad, could be good.

604
00:42:35,089 --> 00:42:37,523
But deep down,

605
00:42:37,591 --> 00:42:40,526
they feel that
whatever happens,

606
00:42:40,594 --> 00:42:43,028
they're on their own.

607
00:42:43,097 --> 00:42:47,864
And that fills them with fear.

608
00:42:47,935 --> 00:42:52,463
Yeah, there are those people.

609
00:42:52,540 --> 00:42:57,068
But there's a whole
lot of people in
the group number one.

610
00:42:57,144 --> 00:43:00,272
When they see those 14 lights,

611
00:43:00,347 --> 00:43:03,874
they're looking at a miracle.

612
00:43:03,951 --> 00:43:08,786
And deep down, they feel that
whatever's going to happen,

613
00:43:08,856 --> 00:43:12,952
there'll be someone
there to help them.

614
00:43:13,027 --> 00:43:16,428
And that fills them with hope.

615
00:43:16,497 --> 00:43:20,957
<i>See, what you have to</i>
<i>ask yourself is, what</i>
<i>kind of person are you?</i>

616
00:43:21,035 --> 00:43:26,132
<i>Are you the kind who</i>
<i>sees signs, sees miracles?</i>

617
00:43:26,207 --> 00:43:29,665
<i>Or do you believe that</i>
<i>people just get lucky?</i>

618
00:43:29,743 --> 00:43:33,702
<i>Or look at the question</i>
<i>this way</i> --

619
00:43:33,781 --> 00:43:38,616
<i>is it possible that there</i>
<i>are no coincidences?</i>

620
00:43:45,826 --> 00:43:48,761
I was at this party once.

621
00:43:48,829 --> 00:43:52,026
I'm on the couch
with Randa McKinney.

622
00:43:52,099 --> 00:43:54,363
She was just sitting there

623
00:43:54,435 --> 00:43:58,098
looking beautiful,
staring at me.

624
00:43:58,172 --> 00:44:01,198
I go to lean in
and kiss her...

625
00:44:01,275 --> 00:44:05,439
and I realize
I have gum in my mouth.

626
00:44:05,512 --> 00:44:09,141
So I turn, take out the gum,

627
00:44:09,216 --> 00:44:12,276
stuff it in a paper cup
next to the sofa,

628
00:44:12,353 --> 00:44:13,911
and turn around.

629
00:44:13,988 --> 00:44:17,890
Randa McKinney throws up
all over herself.

630
00:44:17,958 --> 00:44:19,949

631
00:44:20,027 --> 00:44:24,726
I knew the second it happened
it was a miracle.

632
00:44:24,798 --> 00:44:28,734
I could have been kissing
her when she threw up.

633
00:44:28,802 --> 00:44:31,896
That would have
scarred me for life.

634
00:44:31,972 --> 00:44:35,430
I may never have recovered.

635
00:44:35,509 --> 00:44:37,443

636
00:44:37,511 --> 00:44:40,639
I'm a miracle man.

637
00:44:40,714 --> 00:44:43,182
Those lights are a miracle.

638
00:44:44,418 --> 00:44:47,285
There you go.

639
00:44:47,354 --> 00:44:50,187
So, which type are you?

640
00:44:51,859 --> 00:44:54,054
<i>Do you feel comforted?</i>

641
00:44:56,630 --> 00:44:59,656
Yeah, I do.

642
00:44:59,733 --> 00:45:02,497
Then what does it matter?

643
00:45:09,710 --> 00:45:11,678
I never told you
the last words

644
00:45:11,745 --> 00:45:15,545
that Colleen said
before they let her die.

645
00:45:18,452 --> 00:45:21,478
She said, "See".

646
00:45:23,357 --> 00:45:27,453
Then her eyes glazed a bit.

647
00:45:27,528 --> 00:45:30,895
<i>And then she said,</i>
<i>"Swing away".</i>

648
00:45:32,633 --> 00:45:34,794
<i>You know why she said that?</i>

649
00:45:37,237 --> 00:45:40,798
Because the nerve
endings in her brain
were firing as she died,

650
00:45:40,874 --> 00:45:46,005
and some random memory of us
at one of your baseball games
just popped into her head.

651
00:45:52,519 --> 00:45:55,716
There is no one watching
out for us, Merrill.

652
00:45:57,458 --> 00:45:59,858
We are all on our own.

653
00:46:14,241 --> 00:46:16,106

654
00:46:27,020 --> 00:46:29,488

655
00:46:39,233 --> 00:46:41,133
What do you know?

656
00:46:41,201 --> 00:46:43,601
Well, there was an
accident -- drunk driving,
they weren't sure --

657
00:46:43,670 --> 00:46:45,604
He wasn't drunk.
Ray fell asleep at the wheel.

658
00:46:45,672 --> 00:46:48,197
-- Is he okay?
-- Yeah.

659
00:46:48,275 --> 00:46:51,403
That was the first thing
Colleen asked, too.

660
00:46:51,478 --> 00:46:53,776
She's talking.
What ambulance is she in?

661
00:46:53,847 --> 00:46:56,315
She's not in an ambulance,
Father.

662
00:47:32,653 --> 00:47:34,314

663
00:47:42,296 --> 00:47:43,593
For the kids' protection.

664
00:47:43,664 --> 00:47:45,962
All they were doing was
watching TV from 5:00 a.m.

665
00:47:46,033 --> 00:47:48,399
I felt like they were
getting obsessed,
like you said.

666
00:47:48,469 --> 00:47:51,404
They should be playing
furry, furry rabbit or
tea party or something.

667
00:47:51,472 --> 00:47:52,905
What's furry, furry rabbit?

668
00:47:52,973 --> 00:47:54,235
It's a game, isn't it?

669
00:47:54,308 --> 00:47:56,367
Anyways, they closed
the schools.

670
00:47:56,443 --> 00:47:58,877
And there's been some
interesting developments.

671
00:47:58,946 --> 00:48:00,004
What time is it?

672
00:48:00,080 --> 00:48:01,377
11:00 a.m.

673
00:48:01,448 --> 00:48:05,145
They're gone, but they're
not really gone.

674
00:48:05,219 --> 00:48:06,447
We just can't see them.

675
00:48:06,520 --> 00:48:08,715
Early this morning,
a bird flew into the area

676
00:48:08,789 --> 00:48:11,257
where the lights were
hovering last night.

677
00:48:11,325 --> 00:48:13,953
lt stopped dead in the air
and fell straight down.

678
00:48:14,027 --> 00:48:16,086
They caught it on tape.
They've been playing
it all morning.

679
00:48:16,163 --> 00:48:19,530
The footage looks like
the bird flew into
a wall in the sky.

680
00:48:19,600 --> 00:48:21,500
They found the bird. His --
his head was crushed in.

681
00:48:21,568 --> 00:48:25,664
They think they have some kind
of invisible-shield thing going,
I-like an optical illusion.

682
00:48:25,739 --> 00:48:31,006
<i>They're still there,</i>
<i>hovering.</i>

683
00:48:31,078 --> 00:48:33,808
Some people think there's
more of them now...

684
00:48:33,881 --> 00:48:37,009
All over the place,
over us, even.

685
00:48:37,084 --> 00:48:40,019
There's a theory about
the c-- the crop circles.

686
00:48:40,087 --> 00:48:43,488
They could be some kind of --

687
00:48:43,557 --> 00:48:45,855
some kind of landmark,

688
00:48:45,926 --> 00:48:49,885
visual mapping system
so they could navigate,

689
00:48:49,963 --> 00:48:52,488
coordinate --

690
00:48:52,566 --> 00:48:54,898
makes sense.

691
00:48:55,035 --> 00:48:57,868

692
00:49:08,081 --> 00:49:10,174
<i>Want to hear a story?</i>

693
00:49:17,190 --> 00:49:21,286
<i>Is it true?</i>

694
00:49:23,964 --> 00:49:26,762
So the aliens can't
read our minds.

695
00:49:28,001 --> 00:49:29,559
Oh.

696
00:49:29,636 --> 00:49:31,467
Oh, of course.

697
00:49:37,811 --> 00:49:39,938
They tell you everything
in this book.

698
00:49:40,013 --> 00:49:42,811
It says they're probably
very small, like my height,

699
00:49:42,882 --> 00:49:44,543
because as their
brains develop,

700
00:49:44,617 --> 00:49:46,949
there was no use
for physical development.

701
00:49:47,020 --> 00:49:49,284
It also says they're
probably vegetarians

702
00:49:49,356 --> 00:49:52,257
because they would
have realized the
benefits of such a diet.

703
00:49:52,325 --> 00:49:53,758
Who wrote this book?

704
00:49:53,827 --> 00:49:56,625
Scientists who have been
persecuted for their beliefs.

705
00:49:56,696 --> 00:49:58,254
That means they're unemployed.

706
00:49:58,331 --> 00:50:00,595
If you're gonna make fun
of it, then forget it.

707
00:50:00,667 --> 00:50:02,931
This is serious.

708
00:50:06,940 --> 00:50:10,376
I don't know what got into me.

709
00:50:10,443 --> 00:50:11,637
There are pictures.

710
00:50:11,711 --> 00:50:14,544
Dr. Bimbu, one of the
authors of the book --

711
00:50:14,614 --> 00:50:15,672
-- Bimbu?
-- Dad.

712
00:50:15,749 --> 00:50:17,114
I just asked his name.

713
00:50:17,183 --> 00:50:18,775
You had a tone.

714
00:50:20,387 --> 00:50:24,346
He said there are two
reasons why extraterrestrials
would visit us --

715
00:50:24,424 --> 00:50:26,949
to make contact in
the spirit of exploration

716
00:50:27,027 --> 00:50:29,621
and furthering the
knowledge of the universe,

717
00:50:29,696 --> 00:50:31,994
or the other reason --
they're hostile.

718
00:50:32,065 --> 00:50:34,898
They've used up all the
resources on their planet,

719
00:50:34,968 --> 00:50:37,732
and they're looking to
harvest our planet next.

720
00:50:39,906 --> 00:50:41,533
Here.

721
00:51:10,870 --> 00:51:13,930
<i>Looks a little like</i>
<i>our house, doesn't it?</i>

722
00:51:14,007 --> 00:51:16,373
<i>Same windows.</i>

723
00:51:16,443 --> 00:51:18,070
<i>That's weird.</i>

724
00:51:31,691 --> 00:51:32,783

725
00:51:32,859 --> 00:51:34,622

726
00:51:34,694 --> 00:51:36,218
Yeah, oh, yeah.

727
00:51:36,296 --> 00:51:38,787
That's enough from
Dr. Bimbu for now.

728
00:51:38,865 --> 00:51:41,629
Everybody in this house
needs to calm down

729
00:51:41,701 --> 00:51:43,931
and eat some fruit
or something.

730
00:51:44,003 --> 00:51:47,495

731
00:51:47,574 --> 00:51:49,303
Hello?

732
00:51:49,375 --> 00:51:51,741
<i>Father?</i>

733
00:51:51,811 --> 00:51:54,006
Hello?

734
00:51:54,080 --> 00:51:55,945
Hello?!

735
00:51:56,015 --> 00:51:58,813

736
00:52:08,661 --> 00:52:10,322

737
00:52:13,833 --> 00:52:16,358

738
00:52:16,436 --> 00:52:18,267
I'm going out
for a few minutes.

739
00:52:18,338 --> 00:52:20,306
No one leaves this house --
no one.

740
00:52:20,373 --> 00:52:21,738
<i>Where you going?</i>

741
00:52:21,808 --> 00:52:24,606
Ray Reddy's house.

742
00:52:24,677 --> 00:52:25,609
Why?

743
00:52:25,678 --> 00:52:27,509
I think he just called here.

744
00:52:27,580 --> 00:52:29,639

745
00:52:35,355 --> 00:52:38,688
<i>You don't think</i>
<i>something bad will happen,</i>

746
00:52:38,758 --> 00:52:40,658
do you, Morgan?

747
00:52:40,727 --> 00:52:44,527
Why? You have one of
your feelings again?

748
00:52:47,333 --> 00:52:49,062
Is it bad?

749
00:52:51,337 --> 00:52:54,829
I won't let anything bad
happen to you.

750
00:52:54,908 --> 00:52:58,173
I don't want you to die.

751
00:52:58,244 --> 00:53:01,077
Who said I was gonna die?

752
00:53:03,650 --> 00:53:05,811
Who said I was gonna die?

753
00:53:07,847 --> 00:53:09,747

754
00:53:09,815 --> 00:53:12,249

755
00:53:13,412 --> 00:53:17,576

756
00:53:23,522 --> 00:53:25,717

757
00:53:42,474 --> 00:53:44,465

758
00:54:27,953 --> 00:54:29,887
Hello, Ray.

759
00:54:45,871 --> 00:54:48,431
What happened?

760
00:54:48,507 --> 00:54:52,136
I wrote your number
down to call you.

761
00:54:55,113 --> 00:54:58,344
It's been sitting next to
the phone for 6 months.

762
00:55:01,987 --> 00:55:04,285
When I knew it was
inside the house...

763
00:55:04,356 --> 00:55:09,851
<i>I couldn't think of any</i>
<i>other number to call.</i>
<i>I panicked.</i>

764
00:55:09,928 --> 00:55:12,123
<i>Thank you for coming,</i>
<i>Father.</i>

765
00:55:12,197 --> 00:55:14,791
You're welcome, Ray.

766
00:55:14,866 --> 00:55:18,734
I worked so long that night.

767
00:55:18,804 --> 00:55:21,796
I've never fallen asleep
driving before...

768
00:55:21,873 --> 00:55:23,238
never since.

769
00:55:23,308 --> 00:55:24,468
Don't.

770
00:55:24,543 --> 00:55:26,534
<i>Most of the ride home,</i>

771
00:55:26,611 --> 00:55:30,547
<i>there wasn't a car in sight</i>
<i>in either direction.</i>

772
00:55:30,615 --> 00:55:33,379
<i>If l'd have</i>
<i>fallen asleep then,</i>

773
00:55:33,452 --> 00:55:37,388
<i>I would have ended up in</i>
<i>a ditch with a headache.</i>

774
00:55:37,456 --> 00:55:41,051
<i>And it had to be at that</i>
<i>right moment</i> --

775
00:55:41,126 --> 00:55:45,995
<i>that 10, 15 seconds when</i>
<i>I passed her walking.</i>

776
00:55:46,064 --> 00:55:49,659
It was like
it was meant to be.

777
00:55:58,143 --> 00:56:00,441
I guess if this is
the end of the world,

778
00:56:00,512 --> 00:56:03,276
I'm screwed, right?

779
00:56:03,348 --> 00:56:05,646
People who kill
reverends' wives

780
00:56:05,717 --> 00:56:10,745
aren't exactly ushered
to the front of the
line in Heaven.

781
00:56:10,822 --> 00:56:12,119

782
00:56:12,190 --> 00:56:13,248

783
00:56:13,325 --> 00:56:15,520
Wh-- Where
are you going, Ray?

784
00:56:17,295 --> 00:56:18,762
To the lake.

785
00:56:20,665 --> 00:56:23,532
The way I see it...

786
00:56:23,602 --> 00:56:26,036
these places marked
in crops and such --

787
00:56:26,104 --> 00:56:29,232
none of them are
really near water.

788
00:56:29,307 --> 00:56:33,300
I don't think they like water.

789
00:56:33,411 --> 00:56:36,380
Can't be any worse than here.

790
00:56:36,448 --> 00:56:40,248
Did you see something, Ray?

791
00:56:41,987 --> 00:56:43,750
I know what l've done to you.

792
00:56:43,822 --> 00:56:45,949
I made you question
your faith.

793
00:56:48,660 --> 00:56:52,824
I'm truly sorry for what
I've done to you and yours.

794
00:57:00,005 --> 00:57:02,439

795
00:57:02,507 --> 00:57:04,270
All right.

796
00:57:06,811 --> 00:57:08,836
And don't open
my pantry, Father.

797
00:57:08,914 --> 00:57:11,405
I found one of them in
there and locked him in.

798
00:57:11,483 --> 00:57:14,350

799
00:57:21,095 --> 00:57:23,029
<i>The startling footage</i>
<i>we're about to show you</i>

800
00:57:23,097 --> 00:57:25,964
<i>was photographed by a</i>
<i>42-year-old, Romero Valadarez.</i>

801
00:57:26,034 --> 00:57:28,332
<i>This video was taken</i>
<i>yesterday afternoon</i>

802
00:57:28,403 --> 00:57:29,768
<i>at his son's 7th birthday</i>

803
00:57:29,837 --> 00:57:31,896
<i>in the city of</i>
<i>Passo Fundo, Brazil.</i>

804
00:57:31,973 --> 00:57:34,339
<i>It was sent to the local</i>
<i>news bureau there</i>

805
00:57:34,409 --> 00:57:37,276
<i>and sent to us via satellite</i>
<i>just a few minutes ago.</i>

806
00:57:37,345 --> 00:57:40,576
All initial opinions are
this is genuine.

807
00:57:40,648 --> 00:57:43,879
What you're about to see
may disturb you.

808
00:57:43,952 --> 00:57:46,443

809
00:57:50,858 --> 00:57:52,416

810
00:58:12,046 --> 00:58:15,140
Move, children!
<i>Vámanos!</i>

811
00:58:15,216 --> 00:58:17,207

812
00:58:23,925 --> 00:58:26,325

813
00:58:26,394 --> 00:58:27,691
Oh!

814
00:58:33,334 --> 00:58:35,325

815
00:58:39,741 --> 00:58:41,140

816
00:58:41,209 --> 00:58:43,200

817
00:59:05,123 --> 00:59:07,523

818
00:59:24,642 --> 00:59:26,837

819
00:59:26,911 --> 00:59:28,401
Hello?

820
00:59:36,621 --> 00:59:39,886
The police are here.
I am with them.

821
00:59:39,957 --> 00:59:41,925
I am a police officer.

822
00:59:43,928 --> 00:59:47,489
I just want to
talk with you.

823
00:59:47,565 --> 00:59:49,590
We know all about the hoax.

824
00:59:51,803 --> 00:59:55,637
We already took some of
your friends downtown
in a paddy wagon.

825
01:00:00,711 --> 01:00:03,874
Just tell us your name
and why you did it,

826
01:00:03,948 --> 01:00:07,748
and we'll give you the same
deal we gave the others.

827
01:00:07,819 --> 01:00:10,413
Don't throw your
life away, son.

828
01:00:34,245 --> 01:00:36,145

829
01:01:08,112 --> 01:01:09,841

830
01:01:37,775 --> 01:01:39,106

831
01:01:39,177 --> 01:01:40,201

832
01:01:40,278 --> 01:01:42,212
Oh! Ah!

833
01:01:42,280 --> 01:01:44,077
Oh!

834
01:01:44,148 --> 01:01:46,616

835
01:01:46,684 --> 01:01:49,050

836
01:02:03,501 --> 01:02:05,196

837
01:02:23,888 --> 01:02:26,015
Their skin changes colors.

838
01:02:26,090 --> 01:02:28,718
That's why we couldn't
see them that night.

839
01:02:31,162 --> 01:02:32,424
Tell me something, Morgan.

840
01:02:32,496 --> 01:02:35,795
Uh...in this
book of yours...

841
01:02:35,866 --> 01:02:37,857
did they happen to detail

842
01:02:37,935 --> 01:02:41,132
what would happen
if they were hostile?

843
01:02:41,205 --> 01:02:43,196
Yes.

844
01:02:43,274 --> 01:02:45,572
It said they would
probably invade.

845
01:02:45,643 --> 01:02:50,239
They would use
ground tactics --
hand-to-hand combat.

846
01:02:50,314 --> 01:02:53,442
They wouldn't use our
technology or fight
an airborne battle

847
01:02:53,517 --> 01:02:56,213
'cause they know eventually
we would use nuclear weapons.

848
01:02:56,287 --> 01:02:58,915
Then the planet would
be useless to them.

849
01:02:58,990 --> 01:03:03,222
<i>How could anyone possibly</i>
<i>know that information?</i>
<i>It's ridiculous.</i>

850
01:03:03,294 --> 01:03:04,659
<i>What else did it say?</i>

851
01:03:04,729 --> 01:03:08,096
They said there are one of
two outcomes of an invasion.

852
01:03:08,165 --> 01:03:11,601
One, they fight
and are defeated and
have to return again

853
01:03:11,669 --> 01:03:15,435
with full forces
hundreds, maybe even
thousands, of years later.

854
01:03:15,506 --> 01:03:18,873
What's two?

855
01:03:18,943 --> 01:03:22,344
They win.

856
01:03:22,413 --> 01:03:26,349
I'm sorry, what --
what book is this?

857
01:03:26,417 --> 01:03:29,386
Is this really happening?

858
01:03:29,453 --> 01:03:33,480

859
01:03:33,557 --> 01:03:35,718
I heard a theory that, uh,

860
01:03:35,793 --> 01:03:38,819
they don't like
places near water.

861
01:03:38,896 --> 01:03:42,525
Maybe we'd be safe from them
near a lake or something.

862
01:03:42,600 --> 01:03:45,034
Sounds made-up.

863
01:03:54,211 --> 01:03:57,237
I saw one of them
at Ray Reddy's house.

864
01:03:57,315 --> 01:03:59,306
<i>I can't be sure,</i>

865
01:03:59,383 --> 01:04:02,375
<i>but I got the distinct feeling</i>
<i>he wanted to harm me.</i>

866
01:04:04,522 --> 01:04:06,456
So...

867
01:04:06,524 --> 01:04:11,461
we can choose to believe this
lake idea, pack up, and go,

868
01:04:11,529 --> 01:04:16,296
or we can stay here, hide
inside our home, wait it out.

869
01:04:16,367 --> 01:04:21,532
We might be overreacting, but
I'm willing to live with that.

870
01:04:21,605 --> 01:04:26,872
Either way, at least
we'll be together.

871
01:04:26,944 --> 01:04:29,936
All those in favor of
the lake idea, raise your hand.

872
01:04:32,450 --> 01:04:35,817
Yeah.

873
01:04:35,886 --> 01:04:38,878
All those in favor of home,
raise your hand.

874
01:04:43,728 --> 01:04:45,161
Okay.

875
01:04:45,229 --> 01:04:47,060
My vote counts as two.

876
01:04:47,131 --> 01:04:48,758
That's bullshit!
You're cheating!

877
01:04:48,833 --> 01:04:50,198
Morgan, calm down.

878
01:04:50,267 --> 01:04:52,462
I get two votes because
I represent two parents here.

879
01:04:52,536 --> 01:04:54,629
We don't know anything yet.

880
01:04:54,705 --> 01:04:57,799
We'll be safe here anyway.

881
01:04:57,875 --> 01:04:59,809
I don't want to leave home.

882
01:04:59,877 --> 01:05:02,573
This is where
we lived with Mom.

883
01:05:02,646 --> 01:05:05,308
That's got nothing
to do with this.

884
01:05:05,383 --> 01:05:07,783
I change my vote.

885
01:05:07,852 --> 01:05:09,046
You can't change your vote.

886
01:05:09,120 --> 01:05:12,647
All those in favor of home,
raise your hand.

887
01:05:12,723 --> 01:05:14,987
This is ridiculous.

888
01:05:15,059 --> 01:05:17,527
You lose, 3-2.

889
01:05:29,407 --> 01:05:30,669

890
01:05:33,544 --> 01:05:37,810
We're going to board up
every window in this house.

891
01:05:37,882 --> 01:05:41,545
How do we know boards
will do anything?

892
01:05:41,619 --> 01:05:46,716
Because they seem to have
trouble with pantry doors.

893
01:05:46,791 --> 01:05:49,850

894
01:05:49,850 --> 01:05:52,375

895
01:05:52,452 --> 01:05:54,477

896
01:06:10,237 --> 01:06:12,364

897
01:06:20,814 --> 01:06:22,805

898
01:06:26,753 --> 01:06:29,415

899
01:06:29,489 --> 01:06:31,480

900
01:06:50,010 --> 01:06:52,308
<i>The information we're receiving</i>

905
01:07:10,063 --> 01:07:13,658
There are lights

906
01:07:13,734 --> 01:07:17,465
They think it'll be
400 within the hour.

907
01:07:17,537 --> 01:07:21,564
They're appearing at or within
one mile of crop signs.

908
01:07:21,642 --> 01:07:24,133
They <i>were</i> for navigation.

909
01:07:24,211 --> 01:07:26,304
They made a map.

910
01:07:26,380 --> 01:07:30,749
They're gonna be
within a mile of us.

911
01:07:30,817 --> 01:07:32,546
<i>Dad?</i>

912
01:07:32,619 --> 01:07:33,984
Yes?

913
01:07:34,054 --> 01:07:36,921
They think these are staged

914
01:07:36,990 --> 01:07:40,426
immediately preceding
an attack maneuver.

915
01:07:40,494 --> 01:07:44,897
<i>I was wrong.</i>
<i>They're hostile.</i>

916
01:07:44,965 --> 01:07:47,695

917
01:07:47,768 --> 01:07:50,760
It's like "War of the Worlds".

918
01:07:50,837 --> 01:07:52,532
<i>Ground forces</i>
<i>have been assembled</i>

919
01:07:52,606 --> 01:07:55,541
<i>in countries</i>
<i>throughout the globe.</i>

920
01:07:55,609 --> 01:07:56,701

921
01:07:56,777 --> 01:07:58,074
Hundreds of thousands

922
01:07:58,145 --> 01:08:01,171
have flocked to temples,
synagogues, and churches.

923
01:08:01,248 --> 01:08:03,910

924
01:08:07,387 --> 01:08:10,720
<i>God be with us all.</i>

925
01:08:10,791 --> 01:08:13,783

926
01:08:23,136 --> 01:08:25,400
I'm going to get back
to the windows.

927
01:08:35,048 --> 01:08:37,448
Hey, you guys okay?

928
01:08:37,517 --> 01:08:42,580
Some guy had a sign saying
it was the end of the world.

929
01:08:42,656 --> 01:08:44,248
Don't worry.

930
01:08:46,259 --> 01:08:48,853
You won't let anything
happen to us, right?

931
01:08:48,929 --> 01:08:50,419
No way.

932
01:08:52,632 --> 01:08:55,260
I wish you were my dad.

933
01:08:55,335 --> 01:08:58,099
What did you say?

934
01:08:58,171 --> 01:09:01,265
Don't you <i>ever</i> say anything
like that again.

935
01:09:01,341 --> 01:09:02,831
Ever.

936
01:09:22,329 --> 01:09:25,594

937
01:09:40,266 --> 01:09:42,427
There's too many windows
in the bedrooms.

938
01:09:42,502 --> 01:09:44,094
We don't have enough boards.

939
01:09:44,170 --> 01:09:45,967
We'll board up
the bedroom doors.

940
01:09:46,039 --> 01:09:47,506
Where are we gonna sleep?

941
01:09:47,573 --> 01:09:48,835
In the family room.

942
01:09:48,908 --> 01:09:50,569
What about lsabel?

943
01:09:50,643 --> 01:09:53,806
We'll tie her up in the garage
after dinner.

944
01:09:53,880 --> 01:09:56,371
I'll make some sandwiches.

945
01:09:56,449 --> 01:09:58,041
I want spaghetti.

946
01:09:58,117 --> 01:10:00,278
We'll just eat fast, Bo.

947
01:10:00,353 --> 01:10:02,378
Spaghetti sounds great.

948
01:10:02,455 --> 01:10:04,685
What do you want, Morgan?

949
01:10:04,757 --> 01:10:07,726
Anything?

950
01:10:07,794 --> 01:10:10,092
French toast...

951
01:10:10,163 --> 01:10:13,030
and mashed potatoes.

952
01:10:13,099 --> 01:10:15,067
Now we're talking.

953
01:10:15,134 --> 01:10:17,602
How about you, Merrill?

954
01:10:20,306 --> 01:10:23,275
Chicken teriyaki.

955
01:10:23,343 --> 01:10:26,141
Good choice.

956
01:10:26,212 --> 01:10:29,841
I'm going to have
a cheeseburger with bacon.

957
01:10:31,851 --> 01:10:36,652
Extra bacon.

958
01:11:00,279 --> 01:11:03,373
What's the matter
with everyone? Eat.

959
01:11:03,449 --> 01:11:05,383
Maybe we should say
a prayer.

960
01:11:05,451 --> 01:11:06,383
<i>No.</i>

961
01:11:06,452 --> 01:11:07,544
Why not?

962
01:11:07,620 --> 01:11:09,815
<i>We're not saying a prayer.</i>

963
01:11:09,889 --> 01:11:11,686
Bo has a bad feeling.

964
01:11:11,758 --> 01:11:13,123
I had a dream.

965
01:11:13,192 --> 01:11:15,854
We aren't saying a prayer.

966
01:11:15,928 --> 01:11:17,589
Eat!

967
01:11:17,663 --> 01:11:18,925
I hate you.

968
01:11:20,533 --> 01:11:22,125
That's fine.

969
01:11:22,201 --> 01:11:23,691
You let Mom die.

970
01:11:23,770 --> 01:11:25,397
<i>Morgan.</i>

971
01:11:28,441 --> 01:11:32,502
I am not wasting one more minute
of my life on prayer.

972
01:11:32,578 --> 01:11:35,172
Not one more minute.

973
01:11:35,248 --> 01:11:36,442
Understood?

974
01:11:36,516 --> 01:11:37,813

975
01:11:37,884 --> 01:11:39,977
Now we are going
to enjoy this meal.

976
01:11:40,052 --> 01:11:43,112
No one can stop us from enjoying
this meal, so enjoy it!

977
01:11:43,189 --> 01:11:44,952
Stop crying!

978
01:11:45,024 --> 01:11:47,288
-- Graham...
-- <i>Don't yell at her!</i>

979
01:11:47,360 --> 01:11:49,487

980
01:11:49,562 --> 01:11:51,689
All right, since you're
all not gonna eat.

981
01:11:51,764 --> 01:11:53,561
I'm gonna try
some of everything.

982
01:11:56,536 --> 01:11:57,969

983
01:12:13,986 --> 01:12:16,216

984
01:12:25,097 --> 01:12:28,396

985
01:12:30,336 --> 01:12:33,601

986
01:12:33,673 --> 01:12:36,938

987
01:12:55,665 --> 01:12:59,157

988
01:13:07,076 --> 01:13:09,567
It's happening.

989
01:13:21,190 --> 01:13:23,750

990
01:13:30,466 --> 01:13:32,229

991
01:13:39,575 --> 01:13:41,668
Graham, hurry.

992
01:14:06,102 --> 01:14:08,036
Did I ever tell you
what everyone said

993
01:14:08,104 --> 01:14:09,935
when you were born, Bo?

994
01:14:14,009 --> 01:14:17,206
You came out of your mama,
and you didn't even cry.

995
01:14:17,279 --> 01:14:18,906
You just opened your eyes,

996
01:14:18,981 --> 01:14:21,814
and you looked around
the room at everybody.

997
01:14:21,884 --> 01:14:24,876
Your eyes were so big
and gorgeous.

998
01:14:24,954 --> 01:14:27,855
All the ladies in the room
just gasped.

999
01:14:27,923 --> 01:14:30,619
I mean, they literally gasped.

1000
01:14:30,693 --> 01:14:34,322
And they go,
"Oh, she's like an angel".

1001
01:14:34,397 --> 01:14:37,889
And they said, "We've never
seen a baby so beautiful".

1002
01:14:39,468 --> 01:14:43,996
And then...you know
what happened?

1003
01:14:44,073 --> 01:14:47,338
They put you on the table
to clean you up,

1004
01:14:47,410 --> 01:14:50,538
and you looked up at me
and you smiled.

1005
01:14:52,648 --> 01:14:56,584
They say babies that young
can't smile.

1006
01:14:56,652 --> 01:14:58,711
You smiled.

1007
01:15:00,890 --> 01:15:03,324
Let's go down now.

1008
01:15:14,570 --> 01:15:17,300

1009
01:15:23,012 --> 01:15:27,108
We forgot lsabel.

1010
01:15:27,183 --> 01:15:29,674

1011
01:15:41,130 --> 01:15:42,563

1012
01:15:42,631 --> 01:15:44,963

1013
01:15:48,804 --> 01:15:50,567

1014
01:15:59,815 --> 01:16:03,717

1015
01:16:05,821 --> 01:16:09,086
Should we turn off the lights?

1016
01:16:09,158 --> 01:16:12,321
They already know we're here.

1017
01:16:12,394 --> 01:16:14,589

1018
01:16:18,534 --> 01:16:21,367

1019
01:16:34,817 --> 01:16:37,684

1020
01:16:37,753 --> 01:16:40,415

1021
01:16:48,764 --> 01:16:50,698

1022
01:16:55,304 --> 01:16:56,293

1023
01:16:59,909 --> 01:17:04,278

1024
01:17:06,181 --> 01:17:08,911
Dad...

1025
01:17:08,984 --> 01:17:11,111

1026
01:17:19,662 --> 01:17:22,927
Do you know what happened
when you were born, Morgan?

1027
01:17:22,998 --> 01:17:25,660
You came out, and your mama
kept bleeding,

1028
01:17:25,734 --> 01:17:28,328
so the doctors rushed you
out of the room

1029
01:17:28,404 --> 01:17:30,634
before I even had time
to see you.

1030
01:17:30,706 --> 01:17:32,674

1031
01:17:32,741 --> 01:17:34,538
They're on the roof.

1032
01:17:34,610 --> 01:17:36,601
While they were fixing her up,

1033
01:17:36,679 --> 01:17:38,874
all she kept asking about
was you.

1034
01:17:38,948 --> 01:17:40,575

1035
01:17:40,683 --> 01:17:42,514
They're in the house.

1036
01:17:42,585 --> 01:17:45,713
I wanted your mama
to see you first

1037
01:17:45,788 --> 01:17:49,918
because she had dreamed
about you her whole life.

1038
01:17:49,992 --> 01:17:52,927
Then she got feeling better,
they brought you in,

1039
01:17:52,995 --> 01:17:55,054
and they placed you
in her arms,

1040
01:17:55,130 --> 01:17:58,759
and she looked at you,
and you looked at her,

1041
01:17:58,834 --> 01:18:03,100
and you just stared at each
other for the longest time.

1042
01:18:03,172 --> 01:18:05,367
And then she said real soft,

1043
01:18:05,441 --> 01:18:10,105
"Hello, Morgan.
I'm your mama.

1044
01:18:10,179 --> 01:18:13,114
You look
just how I dreamed".

1045
01:18:13,182 --> 01:18:15,013

1046
01:18:15,084 --> 01:18:17,052

1047
01:18:17,119 --> 01:18:20,247

1048
01:18:27,129 --> 01:18:30,326

1049
01:18:32,701 --> 01:18:35,101
<i>The attic door.</i>

1050
01:18:37,806 --> 01:18:38,932
Let's go.

1051
01:18:39,008 --> 01:18:40,134
Come on.

1052
01:18:54,546 --> 01:18:57,310
We forgot our foil helmets.

1053
01:18:57,382 --> 01:18:59,646
Have we got anything to wedge
against the door knob?

1054
01:18:59,718 --> 01:19:00,742
<i>They'll read our minds.</i>

1055
01:19:00,819 --> 01:19:02,116
You're scaring your sister.

1056
01:19:02,187 --> 01:19:04,280
I'm already scared.

1057
01:19:04,356 --> 01:19:07,519

1058
01:19:07,592 --> 01:19:09,059
Merrill.

1059
01:19:09,127 --> 01:19:10,185
I'm looking!

1060
01:19:10,262 --> 01:19:11,729
They'll know
our secret thoughts.

1061
01:19:27,179 --> 01:19:30,478
I'm not ready.

1062
01:19:30,549 --> 01:19:31,914
Merrill!

1063
01:19:31,983 --> 01:19:33,473
Got it!

1064
01:19:33,552 --> 01:19:36,316
Dad!

1065
01:19:36,388 --> 01:19:39,323

1066
01:19:53,872 --> 01:19:55,601

1067
01:20:06,318 --> 01:20:09,617
Where's Bo?

1068
01:20:17,128 --> 01:20:19,619
I'm okay.

1069
01:20:22,300 --> 01:20:25,792

1070
01:20:40,018 --> 01:20:43,510

1071
01:20:49,895 --> 01:20:53,262
What's happening out there?

1072
01:20:53,331 --> 01:20:55,390
<i>I can't even imagine.</i>

1073
01:20:55,467 --> 01:20:57,992
I hope they're doing better
than we are.

1074
01:20:58,069 --> 01:21:01,334
We don't even have helmets.

1075
01:21:01,406 --> 01:21:03,840

1076
01:21:14,719 --> 01:21:19,452
They're only making noises.
They're not trying to get in.

1077
01:21:19,524 --> 01:21:21,492
Why would they do that?

1078
01:21:21,560 --> 01:21:24,154
They want our attention
on the door?

1079
01:21:24,229 --> 01:21:26,163

1080
01:21:26,231 --> 01:21:27,698
They're distracting us.

1081
01:21:27,766 --> 01:21:29,028
From what?

1082
01:21:29,100 --> 01:21:31,967
The book says they're probably
very good problem solvers.

1083
01:21:32,037 --> 01:21:35,495
They'll find a way in.

1084
01:21:35,574 --> 01:21:39,010

1085
01:21:39,077 --> 01:21:41,307
Morgan,
give me your flashlight.

1086
01:21:47,686 --> 01:21:51,178
They used to pour coal
down in this basement.

1087
01:21:51,256 --> 01:21:53,690
There's a coal chute in here.

1088
01:21:53,758 --> 01:21:55,521

1089
01:22:07,105 --> 01:22:09,801
I can feel air.

1090
01:22:09,874 --> 01:22:11,808
Me too!

1091
01:22:11,876 --> 01:22:13,537
It's getting stronger.

1092
01:22:13,612 --> 01:22:15,079
I'm close.

1093
01:22:22,587 --> 01:22:27,183

1094
01:22:27,258 --> 01:22:28,657
What?

1095
01:22:30,261 --> 01:22:31,455
<i>Hold him!</i>

1096
01:22:31,529 --> 01:22:32,826
<i>I got him!</i>

1097
01:22:32,897 --> 01:22:34,057
<i>Hold him!</i>

1098
01:22:34,132 --> 01:22:35,429
<i>I got him!</i>

1099
01:22:35,500 --> 01:22:36,694
<i>Hold him!</i>

1100
01:22:36,768 --> 01:22:38,759

1101
01:22:59,124 --> 01:23:01,456

1102
01:23:29,521 --> 01:23:32,285

1103
01:23:34,359 --> 01:23:36,759
We don't have his medicine.

1104
01:23:42,033 --> 01:23:43,762
Don't be afraid, Morgan.

1105
01:23:43,835 --> 01:23:46,201
We'll slow this down
together.

1106
01:23:46,271 --> 01:23:47,966
Feel my chest.

1107
01:23:48,039 --> 01:23:50,906
Feel it moving in and out.

1108
01:23:50,975 --> 01:23:52,772
Breathe like me.

1109
01:23:52,844 --> 01:23:54,641
Breathe like me.

1110
01:23:54,713 --> 01:23:56,340
<i>Come on.</i>

1111
01:23:56,414 --> 01:23:58,905
I dreamed this.

1112
01:23:58,983 --> 01:24:00,177
Stay with me.

1113
01:24:00,251 --> 01:24:03,482
I know it hurts.
Be strong, baby.

1114
01:24:03,555 --> 01:24:06,854
It'll pass.

1115
01:24:06,925 --> 01:24:09,826
It'll pass.

1116
01:24:09,894 --> 01:24:14,524

1117
01:24:25,176 --> 01:24:29,010
Don't do this to me again.

1118
01:24:29,080 --> 01:24:30,877
Not again.

1119
01:24:35,253 --> 01:24:38,780
I hate you.

1120
01:24:38,857 --> 01:24:41,291
I <i>hate</i> you.

1121
01:24:41,359 --> 01:24:45,159

1122
01:24:45,230 --> 01:24:48,222
<i>The fear is feeding him.</i>

1123
01:24:48,299 --> 01:24:50,790
<i>Don't be afraid</i>
<i>of what's happening.</i>

1124
01:24:50,869 --> 01:24:53,861
<i>Believe it's going to pass.</i>
<i>Believe it.</i>

1125
01:24:53,938 --> 01:24:57,965
<i>Just wait.</i>
<i>Don't be afraid.</i>

1126
01:24:58,042 --> 01:25:02,035
<i>The air is coming.</i>
<i>Believe.</i>

1127
01:25:02,113 --> 01:25:04,707
<i>We don't have to be afraid.</i>

1128
01:25:04,783 --> 01:25:07,251
<i>It's about to pass.</i>

1129
01:25:07,352 --> 01:25:11,880
<i>Here it comes.</i>
<i>Don't be afraid.</i>

1130
01:25:11,923 --> 01:25:14,858
<i>Here comes the air.</i>

1131
01:25:14,926 --> 01:25:17,918

1132
01:25:23,301 --> 01:25:25,735
Don't be afraid, Morgan.

1133
01:25:25,804 --> 01:25:29,171
Feel my chest.
Breathe with me.

1134
01:25:29,240 --> 01:25:33,301
Together. The air
is going in our lungs.

1135
01:25:33,378 --> 01:25:35,608
Together.

1136
01:25:35,680 --> 01:25:39,514
We're the same.

1137
01:25:39,584 --> 01:25:41,609
We're the same.

1138
01:25:43,855 --> 01:25:45,948

1139
01:25:52,597 --> 01:25:56,192
We should save
the flashlights.

1140
01:25:56,267 --> 01:25:59,464

1141
01:25:59,537 --> 01:26:02,023

1142
01:26:02,023 --> 01:26:02,887

1143
01:26:02,957 --> 01:26:05,790

1144
01:26:08,996 --> 01:26:11,760
<i>Ray's truck</i>
<i>swerved off the road</i>

1145
01:26:11,832 --> 01:26:15,324
and hit Colleen
and then a tree,

1146
01:26:15,403 --> 01:26:18,861
and she was pinned
between the two.

1147
01:26:18,940 --> 01:26:22,034
What does that mean --
pinned?

1148
01:26:22,109 --> 01:26:23,406
The truck --

1149
01:26:23,477 --> 01:26:27,470
the truck has severed
most of her lower half.

1150
01:26:27,548 --> 01:26:29,106
What did you say?

1151
01:26:29,183 --> 01:26:32,209
She won't be saved.

1152
01:26:32,286 --> 01:26:35,483
Her body is pinned
in such a way

1153
01:26:35,556 --> 01:26:39,617
that it's alive when it
shouldn't be alive,

1154
01:26:39,694 --> 01:26:43,721
and the truck is
holding her together.

1155
01:26:43,798 --> 01:26:45,425
And she doesn't feel much,

1156
01:26:45,499 --> 01:26:48,400
and she's -- she's talking
almost like normal,

1157
01:26:48,469 --> 01:26:50,630
and we didn't
pull the truck out

1158
01:26:50,705 --> 01:26:52,866
'cause we -- we wanted you
to come down here

1159
01:26:52,940 --> 01:26:56,137
and be with her
as long as she's awake.

1160
01:26:56,210 --> 01:26:58,974
And that won't be very long.

1161
01:27:00,715 --> 01:27:04,811
Now, Father, do you understand
what l've told you?

1162
01:27:06,954 --> 01:27:09,388
Caroline...

1163
01:27:09,457 --> 01:27:12,858
is this the last time I'm
gonna talk with my wife?

1164
01:27:14,095 --> 01:27:16,154
Yes, it is.

1165
01:27:18,532 --> 01:27:21,592

1166
01:27:39,286 --> 01:27:41,277
<i>People think they came here</i>
<i>to take over the planet.</i>

1167
01:27:41,355 --> 01:27:44,916
<i>That's bull.</i>
<i>I don't think that.</i>

1168
01:27:44,992 --> 01:27:47,517
<i>My friend and I saw them.</i>

1169
01:27:47,595 --> 01:27:49,961
I found a pack of light bulbs.

1170
01:27:50,031 --> 01:27:52,693
<i>They poisoned his family.</i>
<i>They dragged them away.</i>

1171
01:27:52,767 --> 01:27:54,667

1172
01:27:54,735 --> 01:27:57,863
<i>Nobody believes it,</i>
<i>but they didn't come here</i>
<i>for our planet.</i>

1173
01:27:57,938 --> 01:27:59,200
<i>This is a raid.</i>

1174
01:27:59,273 --> 01:28:02,606
<i>They came here for us,</i>
<i>to harvest us.</i>

1175
01:28:02,676 --> 01:28:05,907

1176
01:28:05,980 --> 01:28:09,279
<i>We're lucky as hell</i>
<i>they're leaving here.</i>

1177
01:28:09,350 --> 01:28:11,250
They're leaving?

1178
01:28:11,318 --> 01:28:13,980
<i>That's what they're saying.</i>

1179
01:28:14,055 --> 01:28:15,488

1180
01:28:15,556 --> 01:28:18,047
How long
have we been sleeping?

1181
01:28:18,125 --> 01:28:19,422
<i>12 hours or so.</i>

1182
01:28:19,493 --> 01:28:21,017

1183
01:28:21,095 --> 01:28:25,259
He said
they had poison gas...

1184
01:28:25,332 --> 01:28:29,393
they secrete in small amounts.

1185
01:28:29,470 --> 01:28:32,462
A lot of people died.

1186
01:28:32,540 --> 01:28:34,633
But they're leaving.

1187
01:28:34,708 --> 01:28:36,539
<i>They left real fast</i>
<i>this morning,</i>

1188
01:28:36,610 --> 01:28:38,339
<i>like something</i>
<i>scared them off.</i>

1189
01:28:38,412 --> 01:28:40,573
<i>They left some</i>
<i>of their wounded behind.</i>

1190
01:28:44,485 --> 01:28:47,386
Why are they going?

1191
01:28:47,455 --> 01:28:50,447
<i>People must have figured out</i>
<i>a way to beat them.</i>

1192
01:28:50,524 --> 01:28:52,719
<i>Everyone has a weakness,</i>
<i>right?</i>

1193
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:03,492
You didn't think we'd make it
through the night, did you?

1194
01:29:05,406 --> 01:29:06,930
No.

1195
01:29:09,610 --> 01:29:11,510
Listen...

1196
01:29:11,579 --> 01:29:17,484
there's things I can take
and a couple things I can't.

1197
01:29:17,551 --> 01:29:21,612
One of them I can't take
is when my older brother,

1198
01:29:21,689 --> 01:29:24,453
who's everything
I want to be...

1199
01:29:24,525 --> 01:29:27,085
starts losing faith
in things.

1200
01:29:29,163 --> 01:29:32,257
I saw your eyes last night.

1201
01:29:32,333 --> 01:29:35,427
I don't want to ever see
your eyes like that again.

1202
01:29:35,503 --> 01:29:39,633
Okay? I'm serious.

1203
01:29:43,777 --> 01:29:45,335
Okay.

1204
01:29:48,015 --> 01:29:50,609

1205
01:29:50,684 --> 01:29:53,619
He's been like that
for a while.

1206
01:29:53,687 --> 01:29:55,848
He needs his medicine.

1207
01:29:57,691 --> 01:30:00,489
Have they said anything
about our area?

1208
01:30:00,561 --> 01:30:04,224
Philadelphia and its outlying
counties are cleared...

1209
01:30:04,298 --> 01:30:06,892
but who knows for sure?

1210
01:30:06,967 --> 01:30:09,595
He's not strong enough.

1211
01:30:09,670 --> 01:30:11,763
If he has another attack
right now --

1212
01:30:11,839 --> 01:30:13,101
I know.

1213
01:30:15,242 --> 01:30:19,042
We'd have to be sure before
we opened up that door, Graham.

1214
01:30:33,694 --> 01:30:35,093

1215
01:30:35,162 --> 01:30:39,155

1216
01:30:39,233 --> 01:30:43,226

1217
01:30:43,304 --> 01:30:44,771
It's good enough for me.

1218
01:30:44,838 --> 01:30:45,827
Me too.

1219
01:30:45,906 --> 01:30:48,966

1220
01:30:52,413 --> 01:30:55,177

1221
01:31:43,731 --> 01:31:46,222

1222
01:31:52,573 --> 01:31:54,040
Get the syringes' well.

1223
01:31:54,108 --> 01:31:56,941
We may need to give him
an epinephrine shot.

1224
01:32:19,300 --> 01:32:22,360
<i>The atmosphere here is</i>
<i>cautiously optimistic.</i>

1225
01:32:22,436 --> 01:32:24,904
-- <i>People are celebrating.</i>
-- They're doing this on TV.

1226
01:32:24,972 --> 01:32:26,769
<i>There's a great sense</i>
<i>of relief.</i>

1227
01:32:26,840 --> 01:32:28,865
-- <i>They're dancing.</i>
-- Yeah, like this.

1228
01:32:28,942 --> 01:32:31,274
<i>As we begin evaluating</i>
<i>the loss of life,</i>

1229
01:32:31,345 --> 01:32:35,111
-- <i>Do you want to see it?</i>
-- <i>We will be left with</i>
<i>a lot of questions.</i>

1230
01:32:35,182 --> 01:32:39,209
-- I'll bring the TV in here.
-- <i>I see the same expression</i>
<i>on every face.</i>

1231
01:32:39,286 --> 01:32:42,050
<i>We know the battle turned</i>
<i>around in the Middle East.</i>

1232
01:32:42,122 --> 01:32:45,717
<i>Three small cities there</i>
<i>found a primitive method</i>
<i>to defeat them.</i>

1233
01:32:45,793 --> 01:32:48,023
<i>We have no further details</i>
<i>at this time.</i>

1234
01:32:48,095 --> 01:32:49,790

1235
01:33:16,457 --> 01:33:20,018

1236
01:33:20,094 --> 01:33:23,257
Merrill, wait.

1237
01:33:23,330 --> 01:33:25,662

1238
01:33:27,935 --> 01:33:30,802

1239
01:33:47,955 --> 01:33:51,118

1240
01:33:59,700 --> 01:34:02,726

1241
01:34:22,990 --> 01:34:26,050
Hi, sweetie.

1242
01:34:26,126 --> 01:34:28,117
Hi, baby.

1243
01:34:28,195 --> 01:34:33,929
I was...just taking a walk
before dinner.

1244
01:34:34,001 --> 01:34:36,799
You love walks.

1245
01:34:36,870 --> 01:34:40,237
It was meant to be.

1246
01:34:40,307 --> 01:34:42,798
Does it hurt?

1247
01:34:42,876 --> 01:34:45,037
I don't feel much.

1248
01:34:45,112 --> 01:34:46,704
Good.

1249
01:34:54,188 --> 01:34:56,349
Tell Morgan...

1250
01:34:56,423 --> 01:34:58,653
to play games.

1251
01:34:58,725 --> 01:35:00,158
It's okay to be silly.

1252
01:35:00,227 --> 01:35:01,956
<i>I will.</i>

1253
01:35:02,029 --> 01:35:05,487
Tell Bo to listen
to her brother.

1254
01:35:05,566 --> 01:35:08,160
He'll always take care
of her.

1255
01:35:08,235 --> 01:35:09,224
I will.

1256
01:35:09,303 --> 01:35:11,294
And tell Graham --

1257
01:35:11,371 --> 01:35:13,669
I'm here.

1258
01:35:13,740 --> 01:35:16,300
Tell him...

1259
01:35:16,376 --> 01:35:18,173
see.

1260
01:35:18,245 --> 01:35:21,180
Tell him to see.

1261
01:35:24,885 --> 01:35:27,820
And tell Merrill
to swing away.

1262
01:35:32,459 --> 01:35:36,589
See, what you have to ask
yourself is, what kind
of person are you?

1263
01:35:36,663 --> 01:35:40,690
Are you the kind that sees
signs, sees miracles?

1264
01:35:40,767 --> 01:35:44,999
<i>Or do you believe that</i>
<i>people just get lucky?</i>

1265
01:35:45,072 --> 01:35:52,569
<i>Is it possible...</i>
<i>there are no coincidences?</i>

1266
01:35:56,826 --> 01:35:59,420

1267
01:35:59,496 --> 01:36:02,124

1268
01:36:18,615 --> 01:36:21,083
Swing away, Merrill.

1269
01:36:23,486 --> 01:36:25,454
Merrill...

1270
01:36:25,522 --> 01:36:27,513
swing away.

1271
01:36:46,509 --> 01:36:49,672
Ahhhhhhhhh!

1272
01:36:52,782 --> 01:36:55,842

1273
01:36:55,919 --> 01:36:57,511

1274
01:37:02,859 --> 01:37:06,192

1275
01:37:06,262 --> 01:37:08,059

1276
01:37:08,131 --> 01:37:09,291

1277
01:37:09,366 --> 01:37:10,492

1278
01:37:32,722 --> 01:37:34,690

1279
01:37:34,758 --> 01:37:36,225

1280

Ahhhh!

01:38:27,977 --> 01:38:30,036

1288
01:38:32,182 --> 01:38:34,412
It can't be luck.

His lungs were closed.

Don't touch him.
Give him a minute.

1293
01:38:48,064 --> 01:38:50,191
Graham...

1294
01:38:50,266 --> 01:38:53,133
<i>Give him a second.</i>

1295

Don't...don't.

01:39:16,192 --> 01:39:17,887

1302
01:39:23,066 --> 01:39:26,160
Did someone save me?

01:39:26,236 --> 01:39:27,828

1304
01:39:27,904 --> 01:39:31,101
Yeah, baby,
I think someone did.
