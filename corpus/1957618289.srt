[music playing]

2
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:58,360
Bonnie?

3
00:01:58,400 --> 00:01:59,360
Jackie?

4
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:00,560
Oh my God, Jackie.

5
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:01,520
Bonnie Blackwell.

6
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:03,960
Oh my-- how good to see you.

7
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,280
It's so good to see you.

8
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:07,240
Thank you for coming.

9
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:08,640
Thanks for inviting me.

10
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:09,560
How are you?

11
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:10,960
I'm fabulous.

12
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,040
And I can be worse--

13
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:15,200
Thomas Marshall High School!

14
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:16,360
I mean, look at you.

15
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:17,760
You still look like
a Greek goddess.

16
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:19,240
Thanks.

17
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:21,760
You're looking very
prosperous yourself.

18
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:23,320
Ah, you don't
have to be so nice.

19
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:27,720
I can never break those
midnight runs for fast food.

20
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:29,400
So I know the manager.

21
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:30,720
Heaven.

22
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:32,840
Oh my God, you just
make me green with envy.

23
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:35,360
What are you still doing?
Gymnastics?

24
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:37,320
No, I gave it up
a long time ago.

25
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:40,360
Didn't fit in with the marriage
if you know what I mean.

26
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:41,600
Yes, I do.

27
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:43,120
The things we do for
that band of gold.

28
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:44,760
It's a crime sometimes.

29
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,120
My God, it's so good to see you.

30
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:47,680
What?

31
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:48,920
What is that?

32
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:49,840
Oh, God.

33
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:51,480
It's nothing.

34
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:54,200
Slipped in the kitchen, caught
it on the refrigerator door.

35
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:55,760
A little clumsy, I guess.

36
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:58,040
Clumsy, yeah, I remember
you being clumsy once when--

37
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:59,800
no, I've never
remembered you being--

38
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:00,960
Darling, I'll tell you that.

39
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,400
I'd like you to meet
my husband Zach.

40
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:03,760
He's a great guy.
- Oh, good.

41
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:04,600
OK.

42
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,800
Zach.
Zach.

43
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:13,200
Zach, Honey.

44
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:14,640
Zach.

45
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:17,760
Sorry, I'd like you to
meet a good friend of mine

46
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:21,120
that I invited, Jackie Prentiss.

47
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:22,960
We were in the pep squad
back in the dark ages

48
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,560
at Thomas Marshall High.

49
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:27,760
That's nice.

50
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:28,680
Nice to meet you.

51
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:30,640
Honey, excuse me.

52
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:33,800
Honey, I'm kind of in the
middle of an important business

53
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,160
meeting right now.

54
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:36,400
Well, do you mind, Honey?

55
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:38,760
Just thought you
might want to meet.

56
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:40,680
That's nice.

57
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,320
Isn't that nice what she talked?
So nice.

58
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:43,400
Go get yourself
something to eat.

59
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:44,320
Something to drink.

60
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:45,560
Get something.

61
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:47,720
But actually-- Hey, guys.

62
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:49,960
Hey, guys, can I
get you something?

63
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:50,960
Oh no, anything.

64
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,400
Come on, you haven't eaten any.

65
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:54,320
No, I guess we're just fine.

66
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:59,280
Jenny, nice to meet you.

67
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:00,560
Go get yourself
something to eat.

68
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:05,880
Oh.

69
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:08,440
Sorry about that.

70
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:10,200
Zach's been pretty much
business these days.

71
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:16,160
He's a commodities
trader for the far East.

72
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:20,000
Don't ask me what he trades.

73
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:23,200
There's a lot of
pressure on him.

74
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:25,880
He does well though.

75
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:29,600
I don't know even what
I'd do without him.

76
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:32,040
We can all dream, honey.

77
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:33,440
Walk me to the bar, huh?

78
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:02,640
You got to talk?

79
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:03,480
Bonnie.

80
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:11,760
Or you can have
another silent epic.

81
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:17,120
I have nothing to
say to you, Zach.

82
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:34,160
I think I have
something to say.

83
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:37,600
I have more important
things to discuss, Bonnie.

84
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:39,600
More important things
to discuss than fashion

85
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:42,080
tips, particularly,
with your fat friends.

86
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:47,400
Oh, yeah, you're
really important stuff.

87
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:48,680
Hey!

88
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:49,800
Who the hell you think
you're talking to?

89
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:51,280
Huh?
Huh?

90
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:52,640
No!

91
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:54,480
Don't hurt me please.
- I don't have to what?

92
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:55,400
Huh?

93
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:56,360
I don't have to what?

94
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:57,880
Hey, Bonnie, shut up!

95
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:59,320
I put this roof over your head.

96
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:02,680
I put you these
fine clothes, Honey.

97
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:03,560
I do, Honey.

98
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,840
Honey, I love you, baby.

99
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:07,240
And then what do you do?
Huh?

100
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:08,720
You bitch.

101
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:10,680
Yeah, you bitch about
having nothing to wear, huh?

102
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:13,640
I didn't mean to butt in!

103
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,120
I just don't like
being embarrassed

104
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:16,120
in front of visitors.

105
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:17,280
Oh, baby, baby.

106
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:19,640
I'm embarrassing, huh?

107
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,240
I'm embarrassing.

108
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:22,680
That's what you told that
fat porky you were with, huh?

109
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:25,600
[screaming]

110
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:27,560
All right, I let you go.

111
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:28,560
I let you go.

112
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:30,040
Look, baby, I let you go.

113
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:31,080
See, I let you go.

114
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:32,000
I'll let you go.

115
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:32,960
I'll let you go.

116
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,440
Huh?

117
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:36,920
Hey, you bad mouth
me in public, Bonnie.

118
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:38,440
And you know what
that does to me.

119
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:39,440
Huh?

120
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:40,840
You know what that does to me.

121
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:42,320
You know what that
does to my business?

122
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:43,200
Huh?

123
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:44,800
You have any idea?

124
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:47,240
You have any idea what you're
saying, you stupid bitch?

125
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:49,640
You stupid, stupid bitch.

126
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:51,280
[crying]

127
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:52,840
Get over there.

128
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:54,040
Look at this.

129
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:56,280
What is all of this, huh?

130
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:57,240
What is this?

131
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:58,240
What is this?

132
00:06:58,280 --> 00:06:59,360
What?

133
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:01,040
You think you piss perfume?
Huh?

134
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:02,320
Is that what you think?

135
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:03,200
You piss perfume?

136
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:04,680
[screaming]

137
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:06,640
Piss all up in you.

138
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:07,920
Oh, do you hear that?

139
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:09,440
Listen, listen,
listen, listen, Honey.

140
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:10,360
Shut up.

141
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:11,320
Shut up!

142
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:13,280
Listen.

143
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:15,080
You're pissing off the
neighbors again, Bonnie.

144
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:17,080
You're pissing off the
neighbors again, Bonnie.

145
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:18,320
[screaming]

146
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:20,120
You look pathetic.

147
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,480
Shut up out there!

148
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:23,480
Can't a guy have a
discussion with his wife?

149
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:24,320
Huh?

150
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:32,960
God damn it, Bonnie.

151
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,160
Oh, Bonnie.

152
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:36,120
Come here, Bonnie.

153
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:36,960
Bonnie.

154
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:43,800
Bonnie?

155
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:49,840
Don't play this game
with me, Bonnie.

156
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:55,120
Bonnie.

157
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:00,560
Bonnie.

158
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:01,400
Bonnie.

159
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:08,680
Bonnie, open the door.

160
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:11,200
I swear to Christ, I'll
break this door down.

161
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:13,680
Open the door.

162
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:15,640
Bonnie.

163
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:17,920
Open the door or I'll
break it in half.

164
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:23,800
It's all right.

165
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:31,000
You've got to come
out some time, baby.

166
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:32,920
You've got to out some--

167
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:46,800
[screaming]

168
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:47,720
No.

169
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:49,680
OK, please.

170
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:52,360
You bailing out on me, Bonnie?

171
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:53,520
Is that what you're doing?

172
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:55,040
Yeah, that's what you're doing.

173
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:57,080
You planned this for some
time, didn't you, Bonnie?

174
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:58,000
I swear.

175
00:09:58,040 --> 00:09:59,320
What?

176
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:00,360
You don't think I know
how your head works?

177
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:02,240
[screaming]

178
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:03,640
That's how your
head works, whore.

179
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:06,800
[screaming]

180
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:10,800
That's how your head works.

181
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:12,080
You little whore.

182
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:13,240
[engine starts]

183
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:14,320
You want to know
how your head works?

184
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:15,720
I'll show you how
your head works.

185
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:18,160
[screaming]

186
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:19,160
[crashing]

00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:22,520
[police sirens]

188
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,680
You don't say anybody
did anything, you hear?

189
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:38,280
Can you believe it?
Break problem.

190
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:39,520
I guess, that's why
we have insurance.

191
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:40,880
Can I help you, officer?

192
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:41,880
SGT. BILL STARR: Save
the charm, Blackwell.

193
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:43,160
We've been through this.

194
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:45,080
Well, correct me
if I'm mistaken,

195
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:46,480
but unless you have
some kind of warrant,

196
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:47,720
you got no right to be here.

197
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:48,960
Where's your
wife, Mr. Blackwell?

198
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:49,920
But my wife is my business.

199
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:50,920
Hey!

200
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:52,080
Hey!

201
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:53,640
God, this one
needs an ambulance.

202
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:56,160
This is our sixth call
in the past two months.

203
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:57,840
Are you willing to
wait for number seven?

204
00:10:57,880 --> 00:10:59,560
Tell him it's
all right, Bonnie.

205
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,560
No.

206
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:02,960
I want to file a suit.

207
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:08,640
[beeping in background]

208
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:10,960
WOMAN [ON LOUDSPEAKER]: Dr.
Flores, dial 182, please.

209
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Dr. Flores, please dial--

210
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:15,480
Morning.

211
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:16,400
How do you feel?

212
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:18,760
Kind of--

213
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:21,160
Kind of hurts when I breathe.

214
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:22,480
You have a hairline
fracture on one

215
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:24,120
rib and your right cheek bone.

216
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:27,120
You also have a little cartilage
damage on your left shoulder

217
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:30,080
and a few other bruises
thrown in for good measure.

218
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:32,440
It'll all heal if
you give it a chance.

219
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:34,200
Hey, Doc.

220
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:35,320
Yeah.

221
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:38,720
You charge extra
for the place?

222
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:41,040
It's all part of the deal.

223
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:42,680
There's someone here to see you.

224
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:43,480
Sergeant.

225
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:51,040
Mrs. Blackwell.

226
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:53,320
Is he?

227
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:54,400
He's still in lock up.

228
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:56,440
You still want to press charges?

229
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:57,440
Yes.

230
00:11:57,480 --> 00:12:00,600
I have to now.

231
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:02,240
If he ever came back home--

232
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:05,240
I think we can put him
away for a long time.

233
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:07,240
Time enough for you to get
on your feet and decide

234
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:08,040
what to do.

235
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:13,880
I got you something.

236
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:19,840
WOMAN [ON LOUDSPEAKER]:
Dr. Kravitz, you have

237
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:21,320
a visitor in the main lobby.

238
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:22,200
Dr. Kravitz--

239
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:28,040
Figured I'd get
you some protection.

240
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:31,640
Thank you, that's very
sweet of you, Sergeant.

241
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:33,120
Bill Starr, please.

242
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:33,920
Bonnie.

243
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:39,840
You must see a lot
of people in trouble

244
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:40,840
in your line of business.

245
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:44,360
Why is this for me?

246
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,960
Maybe I just got tired of
acting like it didn't matter,

247
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,440
like it was just part of
the job watching women

248
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,240
take it from creeps like that.

249
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:58,120
There's nothing
you could've done.

250
00:12:58,160 --> 00:12:59,560
I'm a cop.

251
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:02,480
I'm supposed to be there.

252
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:05,400
The whole hero complex, right?

253
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:06,920
Well, I think you're a hero.

254
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:14,520
When you get out
of here, come see me.

255
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:16,600
I'll show you a few
pointers in self-defense.

256
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:21,600
He won't stay in
jail forever, Bonnie.

257
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:24,480
You got time.

258
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:27,480
Just think about it, OK?

259
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:30,800
[beeping in background]

260
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:41,920
Oh, my feet are killing me.

261
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:44,600
Oh.

262
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:45,520
Want some coffee.

263
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:46,800
Yeah.

264
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:48,120
You know, I don't
think women will ever

265
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:49,240
be totally liberated
until we stop wearing

266
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:50,960
high heels designed by men.

267
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:51,800
I know, right?

268
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:56,160
Give me the milk.

269
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:01,240
You left the TV on.

270
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:02,120
I know.

271
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:04,040
I always do.

272
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:06,120
Just as a precaution.

273
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:07,720
You don't have to be
so scared anymore, honey.

274
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:10,520
The judge put him away
for at least two years.

275
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:13,840
Yeah, and then what
happens after that?

276
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:15,560
I mean, just look at me.

277
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:18,000
I'm on my own, I don't even
have a job or anything.

278
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:19,360
Whoa.

279
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:22,680
This is not the Bonnie
Blackwell I remember.

280
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:26,200
I do not like what the last
eight years have done to you.

281
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:27,560
Yeah.

282
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:30,280
Hey, I did this to myself.

283
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:33,400
That bastard has you running
around like a church mouse.

284
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:35,440
You know, you used to be such
a jock in high school, had

285
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:37,000
all the confidence I wanted.

286
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:39,160
You got to get that
back again, honey.

287
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:40,600
Become the person
that you really are.

288
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:48,480
Yeah, you know, I think
you're right about that, Jackie.

289
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:52,040
Maybe I can do that and get
career at the same time.

290
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:53,720
Bill Starr's been talking to me.

291
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:55,040
He had an idea.

292
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:59,120
Whoa, whoa, wait a
minute, Angie Dickinson.

293
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:02,000
I did not say that you
should become a cop.

294
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:03,880
Nobody messes with cops.

295
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:06,080
Everybody messes with cops.

296
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:08,000
What do you want to hang around
with the scum of the Earth

297
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:09,160
for the rest of your life?

298
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:11,600
Yeah, I think I
did that already.

299
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:14,960
Zach's going to get out someday,
and I can't spend the rest

300
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,920
of my life afraid of him.

301
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:19,640
I'm so sick of it.

302
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:21,120
Just let somebody
else be afraid.

303
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:27,640
You're scaring
the hell out of me.

304
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:31,040
[marching music]

305
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:00,560
TRAINING OFFICER: Go, boy,
let's go, on the wall.

306
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:01,960
SGT. BILL STARR: If you
really wanted to become a cop,

307
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,280
the first thing
you have to do is

308
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:04,840
impress your training officer.

309
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,480
It's going to take a
lot of work and study

310
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:07,880
before they accept you.

311
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:11,400
Months of testing and training.

312
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:12,760
I'm ready.

313
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:14,240
I know I can do it though.

314
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:18,440
I've always been a good
student, and very athletic.

315
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:21,320
And you don't even
have to be easy on me.

316
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:22,600
No chance of that.

317
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:24,840
Everybody gets the
same treatment.

318
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:25,800
OK.

319
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:27,840
Why don't you give that a try?

320
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:28,640
Sure.

321
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:45,880
[grunting]

322
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:53,080
JARVIS: I don't think
it's going to happen.

323
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:55,320
Give me just a second, Jarvis.

324
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:56,440
Here, let me show
you how it's done.

325
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,240
I got 20 years on you, kid.

326
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:13,920
You've got to do a
lot better than that.

327
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:15,720
You have to be in as good
a shape as the people

328
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:16,640
you'll be chasing.

329
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:18,760
Better.

330
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:21,160
But don't worry,
we'll get there.

331
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:24,480
[martial arts chanting]

332
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:25,920
Wow.

333
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:32,640
God, that instructor's
really tough.

334
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:37,000
You ain't seen nothing yet.

335
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:39,240
There's the man you
have to impress.

336
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:40,680
[grunting]

337
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:43,400
Oh my God.

338
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:46,720
A side of beef with an attitude.

339
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:49,400
A real attitude.

340
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:50,360
Wow.

341
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:52,000
You ought to feel like crap.

342
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:53,720
You know why?
Because you got nothing.

343
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:55,160
Nothing.

344
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:56,320
You think you can beat
them just with your body?

345
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:58,520
You got to use your
mind, your head.

346
00:17:58,560 --> 00:17:59,880
Huh?

347
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:02,760
I'll tell you what, see
Rodriguez over there?

348
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:03,720
Watch me handle him.

349
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:04,960
He's about my size.

350
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,360
[grunting]

351
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:30,640
Hello, Bill.
- Hey, Lebell.

352
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:31,520
How are you?

353
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:32,440
How's Sammy?

354
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:33,600
How's Sammy?

355
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:34,640
She's OK.

356
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:36,000
Great, great.

357
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:37,800
This is Bonnie Blackwell,
a personal friend.

358
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:39,680
I've got a feeling she's
going to be a tough recruit

359
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:41,920
once I get through with her.

360
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:44,360
Well, you better make
her nice and tough.

361
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:45,880
I hate it when they're
too easy to kick around

362
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:48,200
like Rodriguez over there.

363
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:49,800
She'll do just fine.

364
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:52,640
Is he OK?

365
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:56,840
Hey, Rodriguez, Sleep good?

366
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:58,160
Sorry, sir.

367
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:00,280
I guess I deserved that one.

368
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:02,480
So you still want to be a cop?

369
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:04,480
Yes, I do.

370
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:05,720
Can I ask you one
question though?

371
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:09,640
- Sure.
- Who's Sammy?

372
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:11,040
My daughter.

373
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:12,680
Really?

374
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:16,880
She was in a situation like
you with that husband of yours.

375
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:19,040
She took a lot of shit.

376
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:21,360
She lost her first
baby because of him.

377
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:22,280
My grandchild.

378
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:24,600
Oh, Bill, I'm sorry.

379
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:26,560
Fresh meat.

380
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:28,000
Get over here.

381
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:29,320
Give me your jacket.

382
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:30,480
Me?

383
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:33,720
Yeah, come on,
give me your jacket.

384
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:37,640
[music playing]

385
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:39,560
And the glasses.

386
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:40,960
Now, get in there.

387
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:46,520
Any of you two
know each other?

388
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:47,440
No.

389
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:49,720
No.

390
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:53,360
Riley, show her the
first step to self-defense.

391
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:54,240
[grunting]

392
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:58,240
First rule, be alert.

393
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:00,360
The world needs more alerts.

394
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:04,920
Second rule, learn how to fall.

395
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:06,280
Ronnie, take her
through the routine.

396
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:12,760
[grunting]

397
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:13,760
God.

398
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:15,000
Hey, Bill.

399
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:16,000
What's an old war
horse like you doing

400
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:17,120
hanging out with the new guys?

401
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:18,640
Ah, just fielding
a new prospect.

402
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:20,160
What, her?

403
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:21,800
[grunting]

404
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:23,880
I think your days as a talent
scout are numbered, my friend.

405
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:24,720
She'll be great.

406
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:34,640
You look good up there.

407
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:37,680
The first day is
always the toughest.

408
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:40,640
Bonnie, I'd like you
to meet John Beaudet.

409
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:44,320
Super cop, a legend
in his own mind.

410
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:45,880
- Hi, good to meet you.
- It's a pleasure.

411
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:47,240
What's a nice girl
like you doing hanging

412
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:49,200
out with a bum like this?

413
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:51,000
Learning, a lot.

414
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:52,160
Well, you came
to the right guy

415
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:54,560
if you like the
mature veteran type.

416
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:56,560
I'll be seeing you around.

417
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:59,640
Jee, that guy seems to be
his own best friend, huh?

418
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:01,000
John's OK.

419
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:05,360
You'd do well to end up
with a partner like him.

420
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:09,520
Well, this is what you wanted,
kid, official academy training.

421
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:12,520
I'm feeding you to Lebell
for real this time.

422
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:15,680
You're on your own this time.

423
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:17,600
Come on, take it like a man.

424
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:19,800
Right, like a man.

425
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:22,960
[grunting]

426
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:23,880
Two, step forward.

427
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:24,880
Three, pop to the groin.

428
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:26,720
Fourth, knee the groin.

429
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:27,680
Step back.

430
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:29,200
Draw your weapon.

431
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:30,200
Hands up!

432
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:33,640
Get down on your knees!

433
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:35,320
[grunting]

434
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:36,920
ACADEMY TEACHER: Remember
the cycle of violence

435
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:40,480
is remorseful stage
into the tension stage

436
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:41,960
into the acute
battering stage and then

437
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,800
back into the remorseful stage.

438
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:45,640
You've got the cycle and
it's a continuous cycle,

439
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:47,240
going on and on and on.

440
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:49,040
OK, any other questions?
ACADEMY STUDENT: Yeah.

441
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:50,800
Why would a woman
stay in a relationship

442
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:52,000
where she's battered?

443
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:55,440
[grunting]

444
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:03,800
Oh, there you go.

445
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:05,920
Beat yourself up.

446
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:07,080
Let's do it again.

447
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:09,120
Nah, give it a rest.

448
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:11,240
I want to do it
again, Lebell, please.

449
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:12,040
OK.

450
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:17,880
[grunting]

451
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:20,560
Ow, Jesus.

452
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:25,120
God, I can't believe
how out of shape I'm in.

453
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:29,200
I'm starting to make
me feel guilty again.

454
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:30,760
You ready for chapter
two Wonder Woman?

455
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:32,200
Yeah, let's do it.

456
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:34,680
OK.

457
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:38,720
Arrest procedures, auto.

458
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:40,680
Call in location
or stop and check

459
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:43,360
license plate before
leaving police unit.

460
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:46,240
Instruct driver to place his
hands on the steering wheel.

461
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:48,320
Approach driver side
window with caution,

462
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:51,520
leaving firearm
free at all times.

463
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:55,440
Check back seat for other
passengers or suspicious items.

464
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:59,080
Note driver's features,
eyes, hair, weight.

465
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:01,000
Request driver's license
and registration.

466
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:07,160
Excuse me, Sergeant.
- Go ahead.

467
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:09,400
Hypothetically
asking, if a woman was

468
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:11,680
in a domestic relationship
and she had been beaten

469
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:13,320
several times, and
what really drew

470
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:16,360
the line was her being
completely battered

471
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:17,920
and in the hospital.

472
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:20,000
Her husband threatened her--

473
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:21,760
threatened to kill her.

474
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:26,320
Would he actually-- actually do
it and proceed in his threat?

475
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:27,760
Absolutely.

476
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:29,680
Remember the lethality
checklist we talked about.

477
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:32,320
Remember one of them was the
threats to the victim, threats

478
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:34,640
to the children, the family
members, even to the pet,

479
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:36,360
also the fantasies
of the threats.

480
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:37,680
Absolutely.

481
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:39,840
If this person is in
jail, I guarantee you

482
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:41,280
that if this person
gets out, he's going

483
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:42,960
to try to complete the threat.

484
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,680
It's the same if he's
running around loose right

485
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:48,880
now, I guarantee you he will
try to complete that threat

486
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:50,840
and kill her.

487
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:54,240
[gun shots]

488
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:03,440
That's pretty good, kid.

489
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:05,480
Where have been shooting?

490
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:07,080
I haven't shot before, sir.

491
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:08,760
Just thought about it a lot.

492
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:10,240
Hey, well, you're a natural.

493
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:13,080
You keep that up and you'll
have no problems at all.

494
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:16,520
Let's try it again.

495
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:19,920
[screaming]

496
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:30,880
[grunting]

497
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:37,480
Hey.

498
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:39,520
Hey.

499
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:41,040
Great day for a run.

500
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:42,360
What are you doing here?

501
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:43,880
Well, I like to keep
up with my exercise.

502
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:45,760
You know, I get a little
soft riding around in a unit

503
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:46,640
all the time.

504
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:47,640
I can imagine.

505
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:48,880
You're looking pretty tough.

506
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:50,560
I hear you're doing well.

507
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:51,680
Just doing the best I can.

508
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:52,640
Ah, but is it good enough?

509
00:24:57,320 --> 00:24:58,120
Want to race?

510
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:03,280
First one to the
end buys dinner.

511
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:05,400
You'll never do it, kiddo.

512
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:06,320
OK.

513
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:07,280
Try me, tough guy.

514
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:20,200
Come on, Blackwell.

515
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:21,880
Oh, Blackwell, you look
like you're breathing hard.

516
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:23,520
Come on, girl.

517
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:26,840
[heavy breathing]

518
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:37,080
[laughter]

519
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:42,120
I told you.

520
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:44,160
I don't believe it.

521
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:47,040
Well, I guess that
means I owe you dinner.

522
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:48,000
It's OK.

523
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:50,000
I've got to watch my figure.

524
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:52,760
But you can eat your words.

525
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:56,600
Bon appetit, tough guy.

526
00:25:56,640 --> 00:26:00,400
91, 92.

527
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:01,840
I think you're crazy.

528
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:03,080
Crazy?

529
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:05,720
5.

530
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:08,280
When are you done dealing
with Officer Hunk?

531
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:09,880
In no time.

532
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:11,880
Stand on your bologna.

533
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:13,480
You're scared.

534
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:15,360
99.

535
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:20,280
100.

536
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:22,680
When did you become a shrink?

537
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:26,960
Don't need to be a doctor
to see an open wound.

538
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:30,120
Listen, Jackie, I've
got to take things slow.

539
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:31,600
I just had forgotten
how to be with--

540
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:32,400
Men.

541
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:36,480
No, anyone.

542
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:37,840
Do you understand?

543
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:44,040
Dear God, I'm hugging a cop.

544
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:45,240
I need dinner.

545
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:47,680
Beaudet and Blackwell,
you're up next.

546
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:48,840
John, wait a minute,
wait a minute.

547
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:50,280
Go back there.
Go back there.

548
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:51,160
John.

549
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:52,240
Yes, sir.

550
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:53,680
What are you doing?

551
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:55,120
Sir?

552
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:56,280
Who told you to come out
here dressed like that?

553
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:57,560
Where'd you get
those yellow socks?

554
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:59,240
Sir.

555
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:00,760
If we wanted a clown, we'd go
to the circus to get a clown.

556
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:02,200
We don't want those socks.

557
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:03,480
You wear the regulation
socks, you understand me?

558
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:04,800
Yes, sir.

559
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:06,120
Well, you get your
butt out of the academy.

560
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:07,520
This is not a college campus.
- Yes, sir.

561
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:08,520
Now, get out of here.

562
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:10,640
Beaudet, Blackwell, you're up.

563
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:12,120
All right, Blackwell,
any time you're ready.

564
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:12,960
Yes, sir.

565
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:16,960
Put your hands up
in the air slowly.

566
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:17,920
Get down on your knees.

567
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:19,440
Get down on your stomach.

568
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:20,920
Bury your forehead.

569
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:23,920
Spread your arms out to the
side with your palms up.

570
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:27,360
[grunting]

571
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:40,320
[gun shots]

572
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:51,120
Hey.
- How you doing?

573
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:52,400
Pretty good.

574
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:54,680
If you keep hanging
out with us rookies,

575
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:57,000
people are going to start
wondering about you.

576
00:27:57,040 --> 00:27:58,840
[chuckles]

577
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:06,440
So, how are those tired,
sore muscles of yours?

578
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:09,360
I mean, you're starting to
get pretty cocky, young lady.

579
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:13,400
If I remember right, I
still owe you a dinner.

580
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:14,880
Yeah.

581
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:16,440
Well, it's night time.

582
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:17,280
You busy?

583
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:23,200
You know, I'm still thinking
you lead a double life.

584
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:25,720
And as a matter of fact, I never
have seen you with that man

585
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:26,640
together.

586
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:29,160
[laughter]

587
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:32,960
Oh, you're a funny guy.

588
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,880
No, it's just that I really
have to stay focused.

589
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:36,840
I really need this.

590
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:38,240
I want it really bad.

591
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:40,240
OK, I understand.

592
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:43,200
Well, I'm not going
to quit trying.

593
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:48,640
Neither will I.

594
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:52,920
Graduates, these
past seven months

595
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:55,400
have been the toughest
in your lives,

596
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:59,200
but I would hasten
to add, the proudest.

597
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:02,480
Your training has been
the best in the world.

598
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:06,320
And as the newest members of the
Los Angeles Police Department,

599
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:08,960
you're about to become
members of the finest law

600
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,560
enforcement team in the world.

601
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:15,920
Your mission is to
protect and to serve,

602
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:18,440
and we're all very proud of you.

603
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:21,800
Class of 195, please come

[applause]

605

Congratulations.

606

Congratulations.

Congratulations.

610
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:40,960
Congratulations.

611
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:41,880
Congratulations.

612
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:53,640
It is now my great honor to
present the outstanding recruit

613
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:56,880

614

[applause]

616
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:04,440
This award represents
the highest achievement

617
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:05,240
in recruit training.

618
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:11,720
Congratulations,
Officer Blackwell.

619
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:12,680
Thank you, sir.

620
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:16,040
[applause]

621
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:33,840
Class of 1995, you

622
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:36,320

623

625

and a pride in
what you've become.

626
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:49,120
Welcome to the LAPD.

628
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:58,040
Class of 195, dismissed.

629
00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:01,160
To Officer Bonnie
Blackwell, a great cop,

630
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:05,240
an outstanding woman,
and my new partner.

631
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:06,240
What's that?

632
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:07,760
You mean he didn't tell you?

633
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:09,000
No, he didn't.

634
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:10,360
Well, I figured the
first in her class

635
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:11,960
really ought to
learn from the best.

636
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,680
I'm just doing my civic duty.

637
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:15,640
Mmm mm mm, girl,
after tonight, blue

638
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:17,080
is my favorite color.

639
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:20,640
Woo, sure glad Dwayne
has to work late tonight.

640
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:21,920
You be a good girl now.

641
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:23,080
Oh, come on, you
know I'm all talk.

642
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:27,760
I'll let you go celebrate.

643
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:34,280
She is so crazy.

644
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:36,280
Oh, before I forget.

645
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:39,720
I got you a little
something for graduation.

646
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:43,000
Oh, you shouldn't have.

647
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:44,480
You know, I still have
that little tiger you

648
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:45,800
gave me back in the hospital.

649
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:59,840
Oh my God, that's so beautiful.

650
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:02,760
Oh, wow, this is really--
thank you so much.

651
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:04,080
Here's a little
something to go with it.

652
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:18,040
You did good, for a girl.

653
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:19,640
You are such a tough guy.

654
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:38,520
[telephone ringing]

655
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:43,120
Allow me to introduce you
to the real police work.

656
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:44,040
Go get them.

657
00:32:57,240 --> 00:32:58,760
You know, it's been
a week now, John,

658
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:00,560
and all I seem to do
is fill out reports,

659
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:01,760
is that because I'm new?

660
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:04,920
It's because you're a cop.

661
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:07,360
They haven't even
busted any bad guys.

662
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:08,600
I mean, real bad guys.

663
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:10,080
[police radio chatter]

664
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:12,240
How does anything
get done around here?

665
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:13,600
Well, you just
grin and bear it.

666
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:22,040
Let's get it.

667
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:31,080
Fuck, man.

668
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:32,080
Let's get out of here.

669
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:33,520
Come on.

670
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:36,480
Get a 2151 in pursuit
of the 503, a black Buick.

671
00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:38,320
License plate number 1ML760.

672

[police sirens]

673
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:42,920
Headed East down 6 towards Mill.

674
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:43,840
Any backup units stand by.

675
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:52,920
[tires screeching]

676
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:54,360

00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:03,840
[gun fire]

[explosion]

679
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:25,840
I got him.

680
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:35,920
Stop all your actions now!

681
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:37,920
Put your hands up in the air.

682
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:40,920
I said, put your hands
up in the air, now!

683
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:43,920
[gasping]

684
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:46,040
What the fuck am I
running from you for?

685
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:46,920
Bitch.

686
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:48,920
[screams]

687
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:49,840
Fucking bitch.

688
00:34:57,480 --> 00:34:58,360
Fuck you.

689
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:09,840
I'm sorry.

690
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:21,760
You all right?

691
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:22,600
I'm sorry.

692
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:28,600
Radio in that one got away,
heading north on Hewitt.

693
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:36,680
I'm sorry.

694
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:37,560
I'm so sorry.

695
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:48,400
Bonnie, do you have
the Jackson file?

696
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:50,240
Blackwell, in my office.

697
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:06,960
Yes, sir.

698
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:16,720
Doctor says you're OK.

699
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:18,000
I'm fine.

700
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:21,520
What the hell
happened out there?

701
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:22,400
I don't know, sir.

702
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:24,040
I can't explain it.

703
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:25,680
You better be
able to explain it,

704
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:29,640
cause you got a partner out
there who's worried about you.

705
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:30,520
I'm sorry, sir.

706
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:32,040
It won't happen again.

707
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:34,200
He's not worried
about how you feel.

708
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:36,440
He's worried about
how reliable you are.

709
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:38,960
He's afraid for himself, even
though he won't admit it.

710
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,840
And I'm worried too,
because I can't have

711
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:44,320
you choking out there again.

712
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:45,760
It won't happen again, sir.

713
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:53,440
I'm putting you on
desk duty for a while.

714
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:56,480
John will get another partner.

715
00:36:56,520 --> 00:36:57,400
Just temporarily.

716
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:03,320
OK, sir.

717
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:14,640
[background music playing]

718
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:27,280
Hey, Blackwell, heard
about what happened today.

719
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:28,680
Rough day.

720
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:31,040
Yeah, rough day.

721
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:33,520
Look, I know why
you choked out there.

722
00:37:33,560 --> 00:37:35,880
Even if the rest of these
bozos don't understand,

723
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:37,400
I know where you've been.

724
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:42,400
So I can't totally blame
you for what happened.

725
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:46,840
But understand something, to
these guys, women on the force

726
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:49,040
is some kind of charity program.

727
00:37:49,080 --> 00:37:51,400
They jump all over stuff like
that, especially when it's

728
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:54,800
one of the best that screws up.

729
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:56,840
Is that supposed to
take the pressure off?

730
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:59,600
No, it's supposed to put it
on, whether you like it or not,

731
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:01,080
whether it's fair or not.

732
00:38:01,120 --> 00:38:03,640
You are something here, and
if you fail we all fail.

733
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:06,760
And I have worked
too hard for that.

734
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:09,520
Everybody's got a past,
something that gets in the way.

735
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:14,280
So what do you suggest?

736
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:15,120
Get over it.

737
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:29,240
I took the
liberty of ordering.

738
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:40,520
I got this sneaking
suspicion that you're

739
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:43,040
walking around with the idea
that that guy in the alley

740
00:38:43,080 --> 00:38:44,400
somehow beat you.

741
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:45,400
He got away.

742
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:47,160
He could have killed me.

743
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:49,280
But he didn't defeat you.

744
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:51,000
You saw him come at
you and you turned

745
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:53,560
back into that fright lady I
first met a year and a half

746
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:55,120
ago.

747
00:38:55,160 --> 00:38:57,000
You're dredged up, right out
of the old storage closet,

748
00:38:57,040 --> 00:38:59,280
and put around like an old suit.

749
00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:00,640
That's not you anymore.

750
00:39:00,680 --> 00:39:01,440
You're another person.

751
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:09,080
I'm not so sure about that.

752
00:39:09,120 --> 00:39:12,560
Bill, it was like
Zach all over again.

753
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:13,960
I was paralyzed.

754
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,520
Then you have to
take control and not

755
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:18,000
simply respond to what they do.

756
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:18,920
You call the shots.

757
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:26,200
I'll tell you the truth,
that bloody nose did

758
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:29,440
you more good than you know.

759
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:31,480
No rookie is worth
his salt unless he's

760
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:33,160
tasted a little pain.

761
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:36,080
But he realizes that life goes
on and the job is still there.

762
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:42,160
Bill, I've tasted
plenty of pain.

763
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:45,160
As a victim, not as a cop.

764
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:47,920
You don't just take it
anymore, you use it.

765
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:49,040
Let it make you mad.

766
00:39:56,920 --> 00:39:58,560
They should stick
it out, I mean,

767
00:39:58,600 --> 00:39:59,920
that I didn't make a
mistake doing this.

768
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:06,240
You quit on me now
and I'll personally

769
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:09,160
take you over my knee, and don't
think I couldn't, young lady.

770
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:15,800
I don't know what
I'd do without you.

771
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:19,120
You're a real touchstone for me.

772
00:40:19,160 --> 00:40:21,320
Oh, don't let it get out.

773
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:23,520
Pretty soon everyone will
expect me to buy them a drink.

774
00:40:23,560 --> 00:40:25,440
[chuckles]

775
00:40:30,040 --> 00:40:30,920
Can't do that.

776
00:41:31,080 --> 00:41:33,200
Hey, baby.

777
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:35,600
Oh, Bonnie, I've missed you.

778
00:41:35,640 --> 00:41:39,960
So glad you decided
to come see me.

779
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,920
Honey.

780
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:44,400
I need to talk to you.

781
00:41:44,440 --> 00:41:47,400
It's a funny thing, Zach.

782
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:48,800
I need to talk to you too.

783
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:51,000
Wait a minute.

784
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:54,800
Baby, let me say something.

785
00:41:54,840 --> 00:41:57,680
I forgive you.

786
00:41:57,720 --> 00:41:58,920
I forgive you for
putting me in here.

787
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:00,560
All right.
No, no.

788
00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:01,920
I'm a different man.
I'm a changed man.

789
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:08,000
I've had time to
think about how wrong

790
00:42:08,040 --> 00:42:10,800
I was to treat you that way.

791
00:42:10,840 --> 00:42:15,160
And I've had a lot
of time to think too.

792
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:19,040
Zach, I-- I--

793
00:42:19,080 --> 00:42:21,000
Go on.

794
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:24,440
Go on.

795
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:26,560
I filed for a divorce.

796
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:27,880
A what?

797
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:30,080
You filed a what?

798
00:42:30,120 --> 00:42:31,600
I hear you correctly?

799
00:42:31,640 --> 00:42:32,400
A divorce?

800
00:42:35,640 --> 00:42:36,920
What are you going to do?

801
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:39,160
Huh?

802
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:41,200
How are you going to live?

803
00:42:41,240 --> 00:42:44,080
You, you could never
take care of yourself.

804
00:42:44,120 --> 00:42:46,160
You-- Honey, I'm sorry.

805
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:47,080
Wait.

806
00:42:47,120 --> 00:42:48,240
I didn't mean that.

807
00:42:48,280 --> 00:42:51,360
No no no wait,
wait, wait a minute.

808
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:55,160
I guess, I'm just a little
upset, you know, with the news.

809
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:58,040
Just forget everything
I just said, OK?

810
00:42:58,080 --> 00:43:00,200
Baby.

811
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:01,160
I'm looking at you here.

812
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:02,480
I see you.

813
00:43:02,520 --> 00:43:03,640
You're looking so fine.

814
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:05,720
You're so pretty.

815
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:06,600
I want you, baby.

816
00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:08,000
I want to be with you.

817
00:43:08,040 --> 00:43:10,240
I was thinking later
maybe we could, you know--

818
00:43:10,280 --> 00:43:13,560
Look, I just can't
take the pain anymore.

819
00:43:18,760 --> 00:43:22,560
My life has been shattered
and I'm just beginning

820
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:23,360
to pick up the pieces.

821
00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:30,920
I'm living a different
life now, Zach.

822
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:32,920
And I feel good
about myself now.

823
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:34,520
What is this new life?

824
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:37,400
What do you mean,
lead a new life?

825
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:40,480
Well, that's fine.

826
00:43:40,520 --> 00:43:42,920
You didn't think
you had a good life?

827
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:43,800
Huh?

828
00:43:43,840 --> 00:43:44,920
The clothes?

829
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:47,360
The food?

830
00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:49,240
A roof over your head?

831
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:51,080
Huh?

832
00:43:51,120 --> 00:43:51,960
And a man.

833
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:53,160
Yeah, me.

834
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:56,160
I provided well for you, Bonnie.

835
00:43:56,200 --> 00:43:57,960
I'm not good enough
for you now, huh?

836
00:43:58,000 --> 00:43:58,960
Is that it?

837
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:00,280
You think you can run from me?

838
00:44:00,320 --> 00:44:01,240
Huh, Bonnie?

839
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:02,800
Zach.

840
00:44:02,840 --> 00:44:06,160
God, you haven't changed a bit.

841
00:44:06,200 --> 00:44:09,120
I thought I loved
you, but how could

842
00:44:09,160 --> 00:44:12,840
anybody love a person like you.

843
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:14,200
Goodbye, Zach.

844
00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:16,680
Wait a minute, I'm not
finished talking to you.

845
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:17,680
Hey!

846
00:44:17,720 --> 00:44:19,040
You think you can run from me?

847
00:44:19,080 --> 00:44:20,400
Huh, Bonnie?

848
00:44:20,440 --> 00:44:22,080
You think you can run--
all right, all right.

849
00:44:22,120 --> 00:44:23,960
OK.

850
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:27,320
[grunting]

851
00:44:27,360 --> 00:44:28,360
Come on.

852
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:29,280
You're dead.

853
00:44:29,320 --> 00:44:30,680
You're finished.

854
00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:32,600
You'll shove off to
Buffalo, and you know why?

855
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:34,200
Because your heart ain't in it.

856
00:44:34,240 --> 00:44:35,720
You think you're going
to beat those guys just

857
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:36,920
using technique?

858
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:38,280
Those guys are fighting
for their lives.

859
00:44:38,320 --> 00:44:39,280
Is that what you want?

860
00:44:39,320 --> 00:44:41,280
You got to fight for your life.

861
00:44:41,320 --> 00:44:42,600
Get my drift?

862
00:44:42,640 --> 00:44:44,720
I think I got the hint.

863
00:44:44,760 --> 00:44:45,960
You sure you want to do this.

864
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,080
It's going to take
a lot of extra work.

865
00:44:48,120 --> 00:44:50,400
Yeah, the regular
training just isn't enough.

866
00:44:50,440 --> 00:44:54,320
I mean, I really need
to go way beyond that.

867
00:44:54,360 --> 00:44:56,800
I want to be able to kick
any butt on the force.

868
00:44:56,840 --> 00:44:59,680
Oh, you want to be respected.

869
00:44:59,720 --> 00:45:01,000
No.

870
00:45:01,040 --> 00:45:02,880
I want to be feared.

871
00:45:02,920 --> 00:45:04,640
You want to be feared.

872
00:45:04,680 --> 00:45:06,640
Yeah.

873
00:45:06,680 --> 00:45:07,840
I don't think so.

874
00:45:07,880 --> 00:45:11,000
You just might be
wasting your time.

875
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:14,080
[grunting]

876
00:45:16,560 --> 00:45:18,360
What do you say now, Lebell?

877
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:19,800
Wednesday, my time?

878
00:45:19,840 --> 00:45:20,680
Huh?

879
00:45:20,720 --> 00:45:22,840
OK OK OK.

880
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:24,440
OK OK.
We could do it.

881
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:25,720
You got it.

882
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:29,440
Besides, I think I
like you better on top.

883
00:45:29,480 --> 00:45:32,760
[grunting]

884
00:45:39,240 --> 00:45:42,560
[telephone ringing]

885
00:45:47,840 --> 00:45:49,680
Hey, partner.

886
00:45:49,720 --> 00:45:52,400
This desk ain't big
enough for the both of us.

887
00:45:52,440 --> 00:45:54,320
What you say we ride
the range and head

888
00:45:54,360 --> 00:45:56,720
off a few bad guys at the pass?

889
00:45:56,760 --> 00:45:59,480
You mean, I'm
back on the streets?

890
00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:02,040
That's what the captain says.

891
00:46:02,080 --> 00:46:03,600
What do you say?

892
00:46:03,640 --> 00:46:06,440
Well, I say that everybody
deserves a second chance,

893
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:08,480
especially the best.

894
00:46:08,520 --> 00:46:10,040
Besides, this new rookie
they stuck with me

895
00:46:10,080 --> 00:46:11,480
is a goddamn nightmare.

896
00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:13,160
He packs limburger
cheese sandwiches,

897
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:14,800
he bites his fingernails,
and all he can do

898
00:46:14,840 --> 00:46:16,480
is talk about reruns
of the Honeymooners.

899
00:46:16,520 --> 00:46:17,600
You know what his
life's dream is?

900
00:46:17,640 --> 00:46:18,960
What?

901
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:20,400
To own the first
oceanfront trailer court.

902
00:46:20,440 --> 00:46:21,800
[laughter]

903
00:46:21,840 --> 00:46:24,280
You've got to save
me from this guy.

904
00:46:24,320 --> 00:46:26,200
OK, I'll come to your rescue.

905
00:46:26,240 --> 00:46:27,760
I owe you that at least.

906
00:46:27,800 --> 00:46:29,440
Well, you also owe me dinner.

907
00:46:29,480 --> 00:46:30,760
How about after we knock off?

908
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:32,200
Deal.

909
00:46:32,240 --> 00:46:34,880
But this time,
dinner's on me, OK.

910
00:46:34,920 --> 00:46:35,680
OK.

911
00:46:49,240 --> 00:46:50,600
OFFICER [ON RADIO]:
Come in 825, code 6.

912
00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:52,000
105 North Avenue 52.

913
00:46:57,360 --> 00:46:59,240
[screaming]

914
00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:05,200
I'll take the runner.

915
00:47:08,320 --> 00:47:09,200
[thud]

916
00:47:11,800 --> 00:47:12,760
[gun shot]

917
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:14,760
[grunting]

918
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:16,160
[gun shots]

919
00:47:26,520 --> 00:47:28,080
Give me your left hand now!

920
00:47:28,120 --> 00:47:28,880
Hands behind your back.

921
00:47:47,160 --> 00:47:49,040
So your 10 partner
wants a trailer court.

922
00:47:49,080 --> 00:47:50,920
Yeah.

923
00:47:50,960 --> 00:47:52,480
What's your dream?

924
00:47:52,520 --> 00:47:54,480
My dream--

925
00:47:54,520 --> 00:47:57,280
I want to be Andy of Mayberry.
- Excuse me.

926
00:47:57,320 --> 00:48:00,520
Yeah, I want to be the
Sheriff of a small town.

927
00:48:00,560 --> 00:48:04,200
You know, big fish in a small
pond, master of all I survey,

928
00:48:04,240 --> 00:48:07,600
even if it is a two meal town.

929
00:48:07,640 --> 00:48:10,200
So does that mean you want
a bunch of little Opies?

930
00:48:10,240 --> 00:48:11,520
Well, it depends.

931
00:48:11,560 --> 00:48:15,160
I have to find someone
other than Aunt Bee.

932
00:48:15,200 --> 00:48:17,360
How about you?

933
00:48:17,400 --> 00:48:18,760
Oh, I don't know.

934
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:20,960
I kind of like animals.

935
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:24,120
Maybe I'd like to raise some
dogs and cats and bunny rabbits

936
00:48:24,160 --> 00:48:25,440
somewhere.

937
00:48:25,480 --> 00:48:28,040
So what are we doing
in the Big Bad City?

938
00:48:28,080 --> 00:48:32,880
Fighting for truth,
justice, and the American way.

939
00:48:32,920 --> 00:48:34,400
Yeah, I'll drink to that.

940
00:48:47,400 --> 00:48:48,440
See that W up there?

941
00:48:48,480 --> 00:48:49,760
Yeah.

942
00:48:49,800 --> 00:48:51,880
That's Cassiopeia,
the mother of Andromeda.

943
00:48:51,920 --> 00:48:53,240
Wow.

944
00:48:53,280 --> 00:48:55,120
And what's that zig
zag one over there?

945
00:48:55,160 --> 00:48:56,760
That zig zag,
that's Aetna, she's

946
00:48:56,800 --> 00:48:59,960
the goddess of life insurance.

947
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,320
Boy, those Romans
thought of everything.

948
00:49:02,360 --> 00:49:04,040
Did they have cops back then?

949
00:49:04,080 --> 00:49:05,480
Well, they had gladiators.

950
00:49:05,520 --> 00:49:08,400
You know, leather sandals
and light mini skirts.

951
00:49:08,440 --> 00:49:09,320
Oh, yeah.

952
00:49:09,360 --> 00:49:10,280
They had the right idea.

953
00:49:10,320 --> 00:49:11,680
Yeah, yeah.

954
00:49:11,720 --> 00:49:13,440
They sure couldn't
dance like this though.

955
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:19,960
I'm going to dip you.

956
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:20,760
OK.

957
00:49:27,440 --> 00:49:29,840
Want to come in for a minute?

958
00:49:29,880 --> 00:49:32,240
Yeah.

959
00:49:32,280 --> 00:49:34,400
Let me just lock up.

960
00:49:34,440 --> 00:49:35,520
I'll be right in.

961
00:49:35,560 --> 00:49:36,880
Great.

962
00:49:36,920 --> 00:49:37,920
That's perfect.

963
00:49:37,960 --> 00:49:38,720
Bye.

964
00:50:58,920 --> 00:51:00,120
- Hi.
- Hi.

965
00:51:00,160 --> 00:51:01,400
- Come on in.
- Thanks.

966
00:51:01,440 --> 00:51:02,840
It's really starting
to come down out there.

967
00:51:02,880 --> 00:51:03,680
Yeah.

968
00:51:05,760 --> 00:51:06,920
It's nice and warm in here.

969
00:51:06,960 --> 00:51:09,120
Yeah.

970
00:51:09,160 --> 00:51:10,080
Would you like some wine?

971
00:51:10,120 --> 00:51:13,680
I would love some wine.

972
00:51:13,720 --> 00:51:14,960
Should I pour it?

973
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:15,880
OK.

974
00:51:15,920 --> 00:51:16,680
All right.

975
00:51:23,600 --> 00:51:24,480
That was a great dinner.

976
00:51:27,160 --> 00:51:29,800
Here you go.

977
00:51:29,840 --> 00:51:30,640
Thank you.

978
00:51:39,440 --> 00:51:40,200
So what are you thinking?

979
00:51:44,040 --> 00:51:45,920
Just trying to think of
some clever original way

980
00:51:45,960 --> 00:51:48,240
of saying the most obvious
thing in the world.

981
00:51:48,280 --> 00:51:50,480
What's that?

982
00:51:50,520 --> 00:51:53,560
That you're beautiful.

983
00:51:53,600 --> 00:51:54,920
I like hanging out with you.

984
00:51:54,960 --> 00:51:57,600
And I know falling
for your partner

985
00:51:57,640 --> 00:51:59,440
is against every common
sense idea I ever had,

986
00:51:59,480 --> 00:52:03,040
and I don't care.

987
00:52:03,080 --> 00:52:04,240
I wonder why I don't care.

988
00:52:07,280 --> 00:52:09,080
[telephone ringing]

989
00:52:11,040 --> 00:52:11,840
Hello.

990
00:52:15,960 --> 00:52:17,480
Hi, Jackie.

991
00:52:17,520 --> 00:52:21,560
No, that's not
actually the case.

992
00:52:21,600 --> 00:52:22,680
Thanks, Jackie.

993
00:52:22,720 --> 00:52:24,120
Thanks for your advice.

994
00:52:24,160 --> 00:52:24,960
Bye.

995
00:52:28,280 --> 00:52:31,440
Jackie, good friend with
the best intentions.

996
00:52:34,480 --> 00:52:36,360
Well, that makes two of us.

997
00:52:48,320 --> 00:52:49,160
What is it?

998
00:52:54,200 --> 00:52:55,640
Is it me?

999
00:52:55,680 --> 00:52:57,160
Is it that bust we
had the other day?

1000
00:53:00,200 --> 00:53:02,040
No, it's nothing like that.

1001
00:53:05,080 --> 00:53:10,920
I-- Sorry.

1002
00:53:10,960 --> 00:53:13,840
I just thought--

1003
00:53:13,880 --> 00:53:15,720
I don't know what I thought--

1004
00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:22,760
I'll tell you what, I
had a great time tonight.

1005
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:25,200
Why don't we just
call it a night.

1006
00:53:25,240 --> 00:53:27,120
Leave it at that.

1007
00:53:27,160 --> 00:53:29,040
Go to sleep happy, OK?

1008
00:53:29,080 --> 00:53:30,480
OK.

1009
00:53:30,520 --> 00:53:32,040
All right.

1010
00:53:32,080 --> 00:53:33,840
It's too bad though, I found
this really great parking

1011
00:53:33,880 --> 00:53:34,680
space.

1012
00:53:39,920 --> 00:53:40,680
Bye.

1013
00:53:47,160 --> 00:53:49,040
[police sirens]

1014
00:53:49,080 --> 00:53:50,040
MAN: You say nothing!

1015
00:53:50,080 --> 00:53:53,040
Nothing!

1016
00:53:53,080 --> 00:53:55,520
[beating]

1017
00:53:55,560 --> 00:53:57,920
[woman crying]

1018
00:54:07,520 --> 00:54:08,480
BONNIE BLACKWELL: Open up.

1019
00:54:08,520 --> 00:54:09,840
It's the police.

1020
00:54:09,880 --> 00:54:11,120
JOHN BEAUDET: Open the
door, it's the police.

1021
00:54:11,160 --> 00:54:12,320
What is this?

1022
00:54:12,360 --> 00:54:14,000
You tell me.
What's the problem here?

1023
00:54:14,040 --> 00:54:15,480
No problem here, except
you're in my house.

1024
00:54:15,520 --> 00:54:17,200
Nobody called you.

1025
00:54:17,240 --> 00:54:18,480
Oh my God.

1026
00:54:18,520 --> 00:54:19,680
What's he been
doing to you, ma'am?

1027
00:54:19,720 --> 00:54:20,640
You shut up!
You don't say nothing.

1028
00:54:20,680 --> 00:54:22,000
You shut up.

1029
00:54:22,040 --> 00:54:23,680
You should take it easy.
Folks, clear out.

1030
00:54:23,720 --> 00:54:26,560
Thank you very much.

1031
00:54:26,600 --> 00:54:29,560
It's nothing, officer.

1032
00:54:29,600 --> 00:54:31,320
It was my fault.

1033
00:54:31,360 --> 00:54:32,640
John, let me talk
to her for a second.

1034
00:54:32,680 --> 00:54:34,240
Bonnie.

1035
00:54:34,280 --> 00:54:36,080
Look, just a second
in the other room.

1036
00:54:36,120 --> 00:54:37,120
She don't got to say nothing!

1037
00:54:37,160 --> 00:54:38,720
[yelling]

1038
00:54:45,480 --> 00:54:46,640
I don't want to
cause no trouble.

1039
00:54:46,680 --> 00:54:47,480
It's OK, ma'am.

1040
00:54:53,040 --> 00:54:56,360
He has no right to hit you.

1041
00:54:56,400 --> 00:54:58,800
Do you work?

1042
00:54:58,840 --> 00:55:04,120
Part time at the
job care center.

1043
00:55:04,160 --> 00:55:07,000
And what about him?

1044
00:55:07,040 --> 00:55:08,520
No.

1045
00:55:08,560 --> 00:55:16,880
He hasn't worked in two
years, except for poker money.

1046
00:55:16,920 --> 00:55:19,040
He don't even try anymore.

1047
00:55:19,080 --> 00:55:24,160
It's just-- he's so
stressed out about--

1048
00:55:24,200 --> 00:55:25,400
That means you're
not depending

1049
00:55:25,440 --> 00:55:27,640
on him to live, right?

1050
00:55:27,680 --> 00:55:30,000
So you can file a
complaint and completely

1051
00:55:30,040 --> 00:55:34,200
put a stop to all of this.

1052
00:55:34,240 --> 00:55:36,720
No, I couldn't.

1053
00:55:36,760 --> 00:55:39,080
That would make him mad.

1054
00:55:39,120 --> 00:55:41,760
He's already mad.

1055
00:55:41,800 --> 00:55:44,680
You see this?

1056
00:55:44,720 --> 00:55:46,640
My husband did that to
me with the steering

1057
00:55:46,680 --> 00:55:49,520
wheel of my own car.

1058
00:55:49,560 --> 00:55:52,200
And if I didn't put a stop
to it I would have had a hell

1059
00:55:52,240 --> 00:55:53,720
of a lot more than these.

1060
00:55:57,120 --> 00:55:58,520
And I would have been
in the same situation

1061
00:55:58,560 --> 00:55:59,920
that you're in now, or dead.

1062
00:56:02,760 --> 00:56:07,880
Listen, I can't
tell you what to do,

1063
00:56:07,920 --> 00:56:10,520
but as scary as it is
to put a stop to it,

1064
00:56:10,560 --> 00:56:16,280
it's not half as scary
as it is living with it.

1065
00:56:16,320 --> 00:56:18,160
With the steering
wheel of your own car?

1066
00:56:23,680 --> 00:56:24,520
We ain't married.

1067
00:56:28,080 --> 00:56:28,880
We're just living together.

1068
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:38,680
You should show me what to do.

1069
00:56:38,720 --> 00:56:39,480
Yes, I can.

1070
00:56:54,600 --> 00:56:56,680
John, she's going
to file a complaint.

1071
00:56:56,720 --> 00:56:58,080
And you are under arrest.

1072
00:56:58,120 --> 00:56:59,280
I ain't arrested for shit!

1073
00:56:59,320 --> 00:57:00,960
You just shut up!

1074
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:03,160
John, your turn to
take out the trash.

1075
00:57:03,200 --> 00:57:04,280
It's a pleasure.

1076
00:57:04,320 --> 00:57:06,360
Don't worry about
anything, ma'am.

1077
00:57:06,400 --> 00:57:09,200
I'll show you all the
necessary arrangements.

1078
00:57:41,560 --> 00:57:43,160
So what do you
want to do tonight?

1079
00:57:43,200 --> 00:57:44,600
Oh, am I tired.

1080
00:57:44,640 --> 00:57:46,160
Yeah, well, yeah.
Would you like to do something?

1081
00:57:46,200 --> 00:57:47,040
- How about seeing a movie?
- You want to see a movie?

1082
00:57:47,080 --> 00:57:48,320
Yeah.

1083
00:57:48,360 --> 00:57:49,160
Let's get a paper
and see what's playing,

1084
00:57:49,200 --> 00:57:50,680
so we can go to movies.

1085
00:57:50,720 --> 00:57:51,280
- Well, why do we do that?
- You want to do that, OK?

1086
00:57:51,320 --> 00:57:52,400
[laughter]

1087
00:57:52,440 --> 00:57:53,720
Come on, hurry.
Give me the money.

1088
00:57:53,760 --> 00:57:54,520
Come on, let's go.

1089
00:57:57,640 --> 00:57:59,600
John, got a
robbery in progress.

1090
00:57:59,640 --> 00:58:01,600
Call for back up.

1091
00:58:01,640 --> 00:58:03,600
Come on with the money, bitch.

1092
00:58:03,640 --> 00:58:04,560
Put the gun down now!

1093
00:58:04,600 --> 00:58:06,560
[screaming]

1094
00:58:06,600 --> 00:58:08,560
Drop the gun!

1095
00:58:08,600 --> 00:58:09,960
I said, drop it!

1096
00:58:17,560 --> 00:58:19,520
Drop the gun!

1097
00:58:19,560 --> 00:58:21,520
Leave the gun!

1098
00:58:21,560 --> 00:58:22,840
WOMAN 3: Help me!

1099
00:58:22,880 --> 00:58:24,000
That would be
your shot, Beaudet!

1100
00:58:24,040 --> 00:58:25,000
Cover me.

1101
00:58:25,040 --> 00:58:28,400
[gun fire]

1102
00:58:36,480 --> 00:58:37,880
[scream]

1103
00:58:37,920 --> 00:58:39,640
CAPTAIN: Blackwell, on
behalf of the department,

1104
00:58:39,680 --> 00:58:42,800
we'd like to give you
this metal of commendation

1105
00:58:42,840 --> 00:58:44,240
for a job well done.

1106
00:58:44,280 --> 00:58:45,160
Congratulations.

1107
00:58:45,200 --> 00:58:46,120
Thank you, sir.

1108
00:58:46,160 --> 00:58:49,480
[applause]

1109
00:58:52,560 --> 00:58:54,880
You just keep
outdoing yourself.

1110
00:58:54,920 --> 00:58:57,360
I really owe it
all to you, Bill.

1111
00:58:57,400 --> 00:58:58,440
Thank you.

1112
00:58:58,480 --> 00:58:59,680
No, thank you.

1113
00:59:11,680 --> 00:59:12,640
This is it.

1114
00:59:12,680 --> 00:59:16,440
Wow, great place.

1115
00:59:16,480 --> 00:59:17,400
Can I take your coat?

1116
00:59:17,440 --> 00:59:19,360
Yeah.

1117
00:59:19,400 --> 00:59:20,720
Let's hang it up.

1118
00:59:26,200 --> 00:59:27,560
That's what I always do, too.

1119
00:59:30,160 --> 00:59:30,960
It feels good.

1120
00:59:34,040 --> 00:59:35,040
To the blue.

1121
00:59:35,080 --> 00:59:35,840
To the blue.

1122
00:59:39,840 --> 00:59:43,320
Another bad guy bites the dust
at the hands of the karate cop.

1123
00:59:43,360 --> 00:59:45,120
You were magnificent.

1124
00:59:45,160 --> 00:59:46,040
Thank you.

1125
00:59:51,520 --> 00:59:52,440
Bonnie.

1126
00:59:52,480 --> 00:59:55,400
I'm sorry.

1127
00:59:55,440 --> 00:59:59,160
I guess I still tend to flinch
when anybody touches me.

1128
00:59:59,200 --> 01:00:01,360
I just need to learn
to trust again.

1129
01:00:01,400 --> 01:00:03,800
I hate it as much
as you do, John.

1130
01:00:03,840 --> 01:00:04,600
You think I can hurt you?

1131
01:00:07,400 --> 01:00:08,440
I know it doesn't make sense.

1132
01:00:16,680 --> 01:00:18,080
What are you doing?

1133
01:00:18,120 --> 01:00:20,560
Creating an
atmosphere of trust.

1134
01:00:20,600 --> 01:00:22,320
Here, cuff me.

1135
01:00:22,360 --> 01:00:23,120
Cuff me.

1136
01:00:35,560 --> 01:00:37,800
Now, there's nothing
to be afraid of.

1137
01:00:37,840 --> 01:00:39,400
I'd like a sip of
champagne, please.

1138
01:00:45,880 --> 01:00:48,280
Oh.

1139
01:00:48,320 --> 01:00:50,480
Now, look at the
mess you've made.

1140
01:01:07,720 --> 01:01:09,600
I'm so glad you invited me here.

1141
01:01:09,640 --> 01:01:10,920
I'm so glad you came.

1142
01:02:03,400 --> 01:02:05,600
Nice day.

1143
01:02:05,640 --> 01:02:08,920
Darn near perfect, I'd say.

1144
01:02:08,960 --> 01:02:10,720
My wrists hurt.

1145
01:02:10,760 --> 01:02:13,000
Oh, I thought you
were a tough guy.

1146
01:02:13,040 --> 01:02:15,520
Nah, that's just
good public relations.

1147
01:02:15,560 --> 01:02:17,520
Can't have too much
of that these days.

1148
01:02:17,560 --> 01:02:19,800
Remind me to complement
your agent, huh?

1149
01:02:33,080 --> 01:02:35,360
MAN 2: Please don't take
her-- don't take her back.

1150
01:02:35,400 --> 01:02:36,720
You've got to leave her here.

1151
01:02:36,760 --> 01:02:39,280
Please, don't--
don't take her back.

1152
01:02:39,320 --> 01:02:40,560
I need her.

1153
01:02:40,600 --> 01:02:44,280
I really-- please,
please don't take her.

1154
01:02:44,320 --> 01:02:45,880
I have the money.
I have the money.

1155
01:02:45,920 --> 01:02:47,120
I just have to sell some--
[gun shot]

1156
01:02:47,160 --> 01:02:47,920
Oh, please, help!

1157
01:02:51,160 --> 01:02:52,680
OFFICER [ON RADIO]: We
have a 209 in progress.

1158
01:02:52,720 --> 01:02:54,240
Units in Montgomery,
officer down.

1159
01:02:54,280 --> 01:02:55,160
Approach the premises.

1160
01:02:55,200 --> 01:02:58,160
All the units, respond.

1161
01:02:58,200 --> 01:03:01,200
This is 2151 responding,
ETA, 4 minutes.

1162
01:03:01,240 --> 01:03:03,400
2151 out.

1163
01:03:03,440 --> 01:03:06,800
[police sirens]

1164
01:03:21,880 --> 01:03:24,320
My God!

1165
01:03:24,360 --> 01:03:27,000
You're alive.

1166
01:03:27,040 --> 01:03:27,880
The guy had a gun.

1167
01:03:27,920 --> 01:03:29,440
He wanted money.

1168
01:03:29,480 --> 01:03:31,720
When the cop came he just
shot him and then he ran.

1169
01:03:31,760 --> 01:03:33,440
I thought he was
going to kill my--

1170
01:03:33,480 --> 01:03:34,800
my daughter and me.

1171
01:03:34,840 --> 01:03:36,400
I didn't know what
he was going to do.

1172
01:03:36,440 --> 01:03:39,640
[whimpering]

1173
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:47,960
According to this Hummel
guy, it was a simple break-in.

1174
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:51,080
We haven't found any
signs of forced entry.

1175
01:03:51,120 --> 01:03:53,080
Hummel says he was having lunch
with his Korean stepdaughter

1176
01:03:53,120 --> 01:03:56,920
when this guy broke,
demanded money, almost as he

1177
01:03:56,960 --> 01:03:58,120
didn't have any,
but the guy claimed

1178
01:03:58,160 --> 01:04:00,080
he was loaded, which he is.

1179
01:04:00,120 --> 01:04:02,120
So he calls his broker
to cash out some stocks,

1180
01:04:02,160 --> 01:04:03,760
bring the money over.

1181
01:04:03,800 --> 01:04:05,760
Actually, he called the police.

1182
01:04:05,800 --> 01:04:07,240
Starr and Riley
responded, but they

1183
01:04:07,280 --> 01:04:08,760
didn't know it was an armed
robbery, because Hummel

1184
01:04:08,800 --> 01:04:11,520
didn't tell them.

1185
01:04:11,560 --> 01:04:15,760
Riley got knocked out the second
she came through the door.

1186
01:04:15,800 --> 01:04:17,160
Starr was on his own
when he drew his gun,

1187
01:04:17,200 --> 01:04:21,040
but it was too late.

1188
01:04:33,520 --> 01:04:35,440
Want me to come in
and fix you dinner?

1189
01:04:38,480 --> 01:04:41,400
No, I--

1190
01:04:41,440 --> 01:04:44,320
I really need some time alone.

1191
01:04:44,360 --> 01:04:47,520
That's fair enough.

1192
01:04:47,560 --> 01:04:48,360
I'll see you in the morning.

1193
01:05:03,880 --> 01:05:04,720
[engine starts]

1194
01:05:36,600 --> 01:05:41,080
Oh, Bill, thank you for coming
into my life when you did.

1195
01:05:45,600 --> 01:05:47,440
God, please, rest his soul.

1196
01:06:01,320 --> 01:06:04,320
Hummel says he can't remember
much about the shooter.

1197
01:06:04,360 --> 01:06:07,480
He was kind of drunk at the
time and the killer wore a mask.

1198
01:06:07,520 --> 01:06:08,560
Can you believe that?

1199
01:06:08,600 --> 01:06:09,760
A mask.

1200
01:06:09,800 --> 01:06:11,600
So what are we
going to do about it.

1201
01:06:11,640 --> 01:06:13,600
No fingerprints, Hummel
has a bullshit story,

1202
01:06:13,640 --> 01:06:14,920
and his lawyer is
being a son of a bitch

1203
01:06:14,960 --> 01:06:17,040
when it comes to cooperating.

1204
01:06:17,080 --> 01:06:19,080
I think he's hiding something.

1205
01:06:19,120 --> 01:06:22,160
But there's nothing we can
do but keep a sharp eye.

1206
01:06:22,200 --> 01:06:24,040
It's going to take time.

1207
01:06:24,080 --> 01:06:27,280
I'm sorry to hear that, sir.

1208
01:06:27,320 --> 01:06:30,040
Do you mind if I
take an early lunch.

1209
01:06:30,080 --> 01:06:30,920
You OK?

1210
01:06:30,960 --> 01:06:31,760
I'm fine.

1211
01:06:34,400 --> 01:06:35,200
OK.

1212
01:06:38,760 --> 01:06:39,720
Open up.

1213
01:06:39,760 --> 01:06:40,720
Police department.

1214
01:06:40,760 --> 01:06:41,680
Oh, Jesus.

1215
01:06:41,720 --> 01:06:43,680
Quick, put that on.

1216
01:06:43,720 --> 01:06:44,680
Hurry up.

1217
01:06:44,720 --> 01:06:46,520
God damn it.

1218
01:06:46,560 --> 01:06:47,880
What do you want?

1219
01:06:47,920 --> 01:06:49,360
I answered questions for
you guys the other day.

1220
01:06:49,400 --> 01:06:50,720
I need to ask you some
questions about the guy that

1221
01:06:50,760 --> 01:06:52,760
just broken in.

1222
01:06:52,800 --> 01:06:54,640
The hell is going on here?

1223
01:06:54,680 --> 01:06:56,080
It's nothing--
it's nothing, ma'am.

1224
01:06:56,120 --> 01:06:57,080
Nothing, officer.

1225
01:06:57,120 --> 01:06:57,960
Nothing.

1226
01:06:58,000 --> 01:06:59,160
Nothing?

1227
01:06:59,200 --> 01:07:00,600
This girl was your
adopted daughter.

1228
01:07:00,640 --> 01:07:01,520
No.

1229
01:07:01,560 --> 01:07:03,040
No.

1230
01:07:03,080 --> 01:07:04,440
No, it's what-- it's not
that really-- it's not that--

1231
01:07:04,480 --> 01:07:06,200
It's not what, sir?

1232
01:07:06,240 --> 01:07:07,640
Talk.

1233
01:07:07,680 --> 01:07:08,640
Talk.

1234
01:07:08,680 --> 01:07:11,160
She's-- she's not my daughter.

1235
01:07:11,200 --> 01:07:13,400
She's my wife.

1236
01:07:13,440 --> 01:07:14,880
I got her through
the service overseas.

1237
01:07:14,920 --> 01:07:17,880
They fix up girls who
want to come to the states

1238
01:07:17,920 --> 01:07:20,400
with guys like me.

1239
01:07:20,440 --> 01:07:22,560
I got money.

1240
01:07:22,600 --> 01:07:24,560
I'm not much of a hit
with women, and so I--

1241
01:07:24,600 --> 01:07:25,720
Is that true?

1242
01:07:25,760 --> 01:07:26,960
What's your name?

1243
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:29,440
Quanjiet.

1244
01:07:29,480 --> 01:07:31,760
I thought you said she was
Korean, this sounds Vietnamese.

1245
01:07:31,800 --> 01:07:34,840
Does it make any difference?

1246
01:07:34,880 --> 01:07:37,600
Is she legal?

1247
01:07:37,640 --> 01:07:38,720
No, please.

1248
01:07:38,760 --> 01:07:40,040
Couldn't we keep this quiet?

1249
01:07:40,080 --> 01:07:41,400
If it got out, I could
never face anybody.

1250
01:07:41,440 --> 01:07:43,400
Does she have anything
to do with the person

1251
01:07:43,440 --> 01:07:44,240
who tried to break in?

1252
01:07:47,240 --> 01:07:49,800
He's not a thief.

1253
01:07:49,840 --> 01:07:51,200
He's the guy that brought her.

1254
01:07:51,240 --> 01:07:52,080
He runs the service.

1255
01:07:52,120 --> 01:07:54,200
I paid him.

1256
01:07:54,240 --> 01:07:55,880
Everything was fine for
about a year and a half.

1257
01:07:55,920 --> 01:07:57,600
And then, all of a
sudden, he shows up

1258
01:07:57,640 --> 01:08:02,360
and he wants more money, he said
he'd turn us into immigration.

1259
01:08:02,400 --> 01:08:04,840
I don't have any money
around the house.

1260
01:08:04,880 --> 01:08:07,440
He said he'd turn us in, so
I said I'd call my broker

1261
01:08:07,480 --> 01:08:12,280
and sell some stock, and
instead I called the cops.

1262
01:08:12,320 --> 01:08:16,360
Please, I want to stay.

1263
01:08:16,400 --> 01:08:21,960
Listen, you tell me everything
you know about this guy.

1264
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:25,920
And I mean, the truth.

1265
01:08:25,960 --> 01:08:28,640
and I'll do what I can to
see you guys stay together.

1266
01:08:28,680 --> 01:08:30,000
And that's all I can promise.

1267
01:08:33,320 --> 01:08:36,600
[telephone ringing]

1268
01:08:40,120 --> 01:08:41,960
Well, where'd
you take the unit?

1269
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:43,960
Just a little
independent research.

1270
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:45,040
I'll tell you later.

1271
01:08:45,080 --> 01:08:46,040
OK.

1272
01:08:46,080 --> 01:08:47,040
You look tired.

1273
01:08:47,080 --> 01:08:48,840
You want me to take you home?

1274
01:08:48,880 --> 01:08:49,800
Yeah, if you would.

1275
01:08:49,840 --> 01:08:50,920
Yeah, let's go.

1276
01:08:50,960 --> 01:08:54,320
[telephone ringing]

1277
01:09:30,160 --> 01:09:33,520
[telephone ringing]

1278
01:09:36,600 --> 01:09:39,040
Hello.

1279
01:09:39,080 --> 01:09:43,160
Oh, hi, Jackie.

1280
01:09:43,200 --> 01:09:45,400
Yeah, pretty good.

1281
01:09:45,440 --> 01:09:47,360
I guess.

1282
01:09:47,400 --> 01:09:50,800
Just a little tired.

1283
01:09:50,840 --> 01:09:53,480
I don't seem to get
over Bill's death.

1284
01:09:53,520 --> 01:09:57,320
Well, it just seems to go
around and around in my head.

1285
01:10:02,920 --> 01:10:04,840
Thank you.

1286
01:10:04,880 --> 01:10:08,320
I appreciate it.

1287
01:10:08,360 --> 01:10:10,320
You're the best.

1288
01:10:10,360 --> 01:10:11,400
All right.

1289
01:10:11,440 --> 01:10:12,240
Bye.

1290
01:10:40,680 --> 01:10:42,120
[gun shot]

1291
01:10:42,160 --> 01:10:45,520
[grunting]

1292
01:11:11,480 --> 01:11:12,440
I'll kill you.

1293
01:11:12,480 --> 01:11:13,840
I'll kill you, you bitch.

1294
01:11:18,440 --> 01:11:22,080
I should of been
there for you.

1295
01:11:22,120 --> 01:11:23,800
It's OK.

1296
01:11:23,840 --> 01:11:25,760
It's not much you
could have done.

1297
01:11:25,800 --> 01:11:27,480
What the hell is he
doing out anyway?

1298
01:11:27,520 --> 01:11:30,640
He had another six months to go.

1299
01:11:30,680 --> 01:11:32,160
Well, I checked
with the prisons.

1300
01:11:32,200 --> 01:11:34,960
He was with parole
two weeks ago.

1301
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:37,720
Out on good behavior.

1302
01:11:37,760 --> 01:11:39,720
We checked the room
we was digging around

1303
01:11:39,760 --> 01:11:44,280
and I found this in the
safe behind the bookshelf.

1304
01:11:44,320 --> 01:11:47,120
You sure you had no idea
he had a safe in the house?

1305
01:11:47,160 --> 01:11:48,040
No.

1306
01:11:48,080 --> 01:11:49,480
Not at all.

1307
01:11:49,520 --> 01:11:51,880
I knew it was just
a storage closet.

1308
01:11:51,920 --> 01:11:54,080
I never cleaned it out.

1309
01:11:54,120 --> 01:11:56,200
What is this?

1310
01:11:56,240 --> 01:11:58,160
Best that I can tell,
your husband was creating

1311
01:11:58,200 --> 01:12:00,160
fake IDs for these girls.

1312
01:12:00,200 --> 01:12:01,600
These are immigration documents.

1313
01:12:01,640 --> 01:12:03,400
They're probably fake like
the rest of this stuff.

1314
01:12:03,440 --> 01:12:05,800
So this was sitting around
the whole time he was in jail.

1315
01:12:05,840 --> 01:12:09,520
Probably just wanted to steal
it back before you found it.

1316
01:12:09,560 --> 01:12:12,440
But what was he going
to do with all of it.

1317
01:12:12,480 --> 01:12:13,520
That's what we
have to find out.

1318
01:12:16,440 --> 01:12:20,200
We've had an opportunity
to review all your records.

1319
01:12:20,240 --> 01:12:23,680
You have been an
exemplary person.

1320
01:12:23,720 --> 01:12:26,720
We are very happy with your
growth and development.

1321
01:12:26,760 --> 01:12:29,880
The psychologist feel very
confident about your evolution,

1322
01:12:29,920 --> 01:12:33,840
but you must appreciate that
we have a legitimate concern

1323
01:12:33,880 --> 01:12:35,320
regarding the general public.

1324
01:12:35,360 --> 01:12:37,040
We want it to be
a comfortable fit

1325
01:12:37,080 --> 01:12:42,120
for them, and yet for you also.

1326
01:12:42,160 --> 01:12:44,800
Do you feel that
your incarceration

1327
01:12:44,840 --> 01:12:47,480
has had any impact
on your thinking

1328
01:12:47,520 --> 01:12:52,280
about your role in
society, about respect

1329
01:12:52,320 --> 01:12:53,160
for law and order?

1330
01:12:58,040 --> 01:12:59,880
How dare you.

1331
01:12:59,920 --> 01:13:02,640
How dare you not tell
me he was released.

1332
01:13:02,680 --> 01:13:05,920
He had another six months
to go, and you didn't even

1333
01:13:05,960 --> 01:13:07,440
call me to the hearing.

1334
01:13:07,480 --> 01:13:10,280
Ma'am, what are
you talking about?

1335
01:13:10,320 --> 01:13:12,800
I'm talking about
Zachary Blackwell.

1336
01:13:12,840 --> 01:13:14,480
My husband.

1337
01:13:14,520 --> 01:13:17,960
He was sentenced for two years,
and you released him early.

1338
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:21,160
And you didn't even think it
was important enough to call me?

1339
01:13:21,200 --> 01:13:24,200
Who the hell's rights
are you protecting here?

1340
01:13:24,240 --> 01:13:26,480
Maybe I should
leave you folks alone.

1341
01:13:26,520 --> 01:13:28,080
Annie, you stay put.

1342
01:13:28,120 --> 01:13:31,640
Officer, we complied with
all the relevant regulations.

1343
01:13:31,680 --> 01:13:33,440
We felt that it was--
- Bullshit.

1344
01:13:33,480 --> 01:13:34,640
You felt nothing.

1345
01:13:34,680 --> 01:13:36,600
And you acted like
God damn robots

1346
01:13:36,640 --> 01:13:39,320
who know nothing about
him or me or the women

1347
01:13:39,360 --> 01:13:43,840
out there who have to face
this scum when you let him go.

1348
01:13:43,880 --> 01:13:45,680
God damn you!

1349
01:13:45,720 --> 01:13:47,040
Yeah, go on, girl.

1350
01:13:47,080 --> 01:13:49,040
You tell them like it is.

1351
01:13:49,080 --> 01:13:50,160
Yeah, you're a real man.

1352
01:13:53,120 --> 01:13:55,360
[telephone ringing]

1353
01:13:56,920 --> 01:13:59,560
Hey, how was your lunch?

1354
01:13:59,600 --> 01:14:01,040
Wonderful.

1355
01:14:01,080 --> 01:14:02,360
What do you got?

1356
01:14:02,400 --> 01:14:03,640
Well, they ran a check
on those passports.

1357
01:14:03,680 --> 01:14:05,800
As expected, they're homemade.

1358
01:14:05,840 --> 01:14:08,240
The girls are not citizens,
they're Vietnamese.

1359
01:14:08,280 --> 01:14:09,880
Mail order brides.

1360
01:14:09,920 --> 01:14:13,080
We tracked them down to the
home of some wealthy bachelors.

1361
01:14:13,120 --> 01:14:15,680
The INS has been after
this guy for years.

1362
01:14:15,720 --> 01:14:18,080
Mail order brides?

1363
01:14:18,120 --> 01:14:20,040
Zach was into mail order brides?

1364
01:14:20,080 --> 01:14:21,320
Yeah, apparently.

1365
01:14:21,360 --> 01:14:23,520
But we got a special problem.

1366
01:14:23,560 --> 01:14:24,840
Right?

1367
01:14:24,880 --> 01:14:26,320
We don't have trade
relations with Vietnam,

1368
01:14:26,360 --> 01:14:28,560
so anything coming
through them is illegal.

1369
01:14:28,600 --> 01:14:29,400
Bingo.

1370
01:14:33,280 --> 01:14:36,080
[keys clacking]

1371
01:14:36,120 --> 01:14:37,440
Where you going?

1372
01:14:37,480 --> 01:14:39,080
I've got some papers
to sign for the course.

1373
01:15:23,080 --> 01:15:25,560
You lost?

1374
01:15:25,600 --> 01:15:28,960
[grunting]

1375
01:15:43,160 --> 01:15:45,960
You kill a cop and
it's all over for you.

1376
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:47,360
Who's going to ID me?

1377
01:15:47,400 --> 01:15:50,040
You think they'd
find witnesses here?

1378
01:15:50,080 --> 01:15:51,520
I own these streets.

1379
01:15:51,560 --> 01:15:54,640
What do you want?

1380
01:15:54,680 --> 01:15:56,720
I'm looking for these girls.

1381
01:15:56,760 --> 01:15:58,840
Do you know any of them?

1382
01:15:58,880 --> 01:15:59,960
Maybe.

1383
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:01,880
What do you want with them?

1384
01:16:01,920 --> 01:16:03,360
They're here illegally.

1385
01:16:07,440 --> 01:16:09,080
And who isn't?

1386
01:16:09,120 --> 01:16:09,960
What do you care?

1387
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:12,480
You're not immigration.

1388
01:16:12,520 --> 01:16:13,840
I'm not looking for them.

1389
01:16:13,880 --> 01:16:17,240
I want the guy who
brought them here.

1390
01:16:17,280 --> 01:16:18,680
So do we.

1391
01:16:18,720 --> 01:16:20,040
You?

1392
01:16:20,080 --> 01:16:21,640
Why?

1393
01:16:21,680 --> 01:16:24,280
Because he a slave trader.

1394
01:16:24,320 --> 01:16:25,760
What?

1395
01:16:25,800 --> 01:16:28,120
He pays Thai boatmen
to kidnap runaways

1396
01:16:28,160 --> 01:16:31,040
in Saigon, Di Linh, Cao Lanh.

1397
01:16:31,080 --> 01:16:32,440
Smuggle them here.

1398
01:16:32,480 --> 01:16:35,440
Sell my people to
rich white bastards.

1399
01:16:35,480 --> 01:16:36,880
We know him.

1400
01:16:36,920 --> 01:16:37,800
Been in jail.

1401
01:16:37,840 --> 01:16:40,160
Safest place for him.

1402
01:16:40,200 --> 01:16:46,080
His name is Blackwell.

1403
01:16:46,120 --> 01:16:49,040
Who the fuck are you?

1404
01:16:49,080 --> 01:16:50,640
I'm his wife.

1405
01:16:50,680 --> 01:16:53,480
And I put him in jail once
and I'm going to do it again.

1406
01:16:56,640 --> 01:17:00,080
The wife wants
to put him in jail.

1407
01:17:00,120 --> 01:17:02,920
This man sure knows
how to make friends.

1408
01:17:02,960 --> 01:17:04,600
You know how to fight.

1409
01:17:04,640 --> 01:17:09,680
I respect that I don't
know where he is,

1410
01:17:09,720 --> 01:17:13,680
but the Manta Ray
is in that picture.

1411
01:17:13,720 --> 01:17:17,640
Comes in the first of
the month, Dock 51.

1412
01:17:17,680 --> 01:17:19,640
You find him.

1413
01:17:19,680 --> 01:17:22,520
We cut his dick off
like a good wife.

1414
01:17:56,280 --> 01:18:00,040
Officer Beaudet, please.
Hi, John.

1415
01:18:00,080 --> 01:18:01,960
It's Bonnie.

1416
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:04,200
Listen, call the
Coast Guard registry

1417
01:18:04,240 --> 01:18:05,960
and look up the Manta Ray.

1418
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:08,320
Zach tried to break in
to still the blank IDs

1419
01:18:08,360 --> 01:18:12,080
because he's bringing
another shipment of girls.

1420
01:18:12,120 --> 01:18:13,400
Yeah.

1421
01:18:13,440 --> 01:18:14,600
Listen, we have to nail him.

1422
01:18:14,640 --> 01:18:16,320
We have to find that boat.

1423
01:18:16,360 --> 01:18:18,200
If the gang leader
was right, they'll

1424
01:18:18,240 --> 01:18:20,880
be heading in sometime tonight.

1425
01:18:20,920 --> 01:18:21,960
OK.

1426
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:22,760
Bye.

1427
01:18:49,280 --> 01:18:50,160
So how do you want to do it?

1428
01:18:50,200 --> 01:18:53,040
Well, back-up's on the way.

1429
01:18:53,080 --> 01:18:54,320
We've got to move in on them.

1430
01:18:54,360 --> 01:18:56,280
Catch them in the act.

1431
01:18:56,320 --> 01:19:01,200
Listen, this time, you take the
front and I'll take the back.

1432
01:19:01,240 --> 01:19:03,880
But promise me one
thing, show up this time.

1433
01:19:03,920 --> 01:19:04,720
Promise.

1434
01:19:09,800 --> 01:19:10,680
[rattling]

1435
01:20:02,960 --> 01:20:05,920
MAN: Just be patient

1436
01:20:05,960 --> 01:20:07,120
ZACH BLACKWELL: Come on, smile.

1437
01:20:07,160 --> 01:20:08,360
Girls, you're in America now.

1438
01:20:08,400 --> 01:20:09,720
Come on, be happy.

1439
01:20:09,760 --> 01:20:12,120
[laughter]

1440
01:20:12,160 --> 01:20:13,880
Say, will you take
those girls upstairs?

1441
01:20:13,920 --> 01:20:16,680
Hold them upstairs until the--

1442
01:20:16,720 --> 01:20:17,960
come on, girls, smile.

1443
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:19,160
What's the matter
with these girls?

1444
01:20:19,200 --> 01:20:20,640
They need to relax.
We're happy!

1445
01:20:20,680 --> 01:20:23,120
Can you say sensation
mister, sensation mister?

1446
01:20:23,160 --> 01:20:24,200
You're in America now.

1447
01:20:24,240 --> 01:20:25,000
Come on.

1448
01:20:31,600 --> 01:20:32,840
God, you're so nervous.

1449
01:20:32,880 --> 01:20:34,040
I don't know what's
the matter with you.

1450
01:20:34,080 --> 01:20:35,000
Relax.

1451
01:20:35,040 --> 01:20:35,920
Can I get you another girl?

1452
01:20:46,480 --> 01:20:47,840
I don't know why it's late.

1453
01:20:54,880 --> 01:20:55,760
[thud]

1454
01:20:58,360 --> 01:21:01,720
[gun fire]

1455
01:21:13,240 --> 01:21:15,000
Get out!

1456
01:21:15,040 --> 01:21:15,960
Stop her.

1457
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:16,840
Why do you think I paid you?

1458
01:21:16,880 --> 01:21:19,760
[gun fire]

1459
01:21:21,440 --> 01:21:22,240
Zach.

1460
01:21:28,840 --> 01:21:29,720
[thud]

1461
01:21:29,760 --> 01:21:33,080
[grunting]

1462
01:21:52,480 --> 01:21:54,680
Goodnight, lover boy.

1463
01:21:54,720 --> 01:21:55,560
Go get her!

1464
01:21:55,600 --> 01:21:56,480
Go get her!

1465
01:21:56,520 --> 01:21:59,480
[helicopter flying]

1466
01:22:01,080 --> 01:22:04,440
[grunting]

1467
01:22:36,440 --> 01:22:37,800
[gun shots]

1468
01:22:59,840 --> 01:23:02,680
Put the gun down, Zach.

1469
01:23:02,720 --> 01:23:05,840
I said put the gun down!

1470
01:23:05,880 --> 01:23:08,520
Sweetheart, didn't I tell you?

1471
01:23:08,560 --> 01:23:13,120
Never bother me at the office!

1472
01:23:13,160 --> 01:23:14,480
Anyway, so nice to see you.

1473
01:23:17,440 --> 01:23:18,360
What is this?

1474
01:23:18,400 --> 01:23:20,720
What is this new wardrobe?

1475
01:23:20,760 --> 01:23:22,320
Ah?

1476
01:23:22,360 --> 01:23:23,800
Tell me, Bonnie, does it make
you feel more like a man?

1477
01:23:23,840 --> 01:23:25,000
Huh?

1478
01:23:25,040 --> 01:23:27,240
What is this new career?

1479
01:23:27,280 --> 01:23:29,560
I think I like the old Bonnie.

1480
01:23:29,600 --> 01:23:34,360
You see, every man needs an
outlet for his anxieties.

1481
01:23:34,400 --> 01:23:35,760
Why?

1482
01:23:35,800 --> 01:23:37,640
Because you took it--

1483
01:23:37,680 --> 01:23:40,600
You took it so well.

1484
01:23:40,640 --> 01:23:41,880
[laughter]

1485
01:23:41,920 --> 01:23:42,840
Wife.

1486

[grunting]

1487
01:23:44,360 --> 01:23:46,280
Don't shoot.

1488
01:23:46,320 --> 01:23:47,760
Take the money!

1489
01:23:47,800 --> 01:23:49,240
You can have the money!

1490
01:23:49,280 --> 01:23:51,120
[screaming]

1491
01:23:58,120 --> 01:24:00,520
Congratulations, Zach.

1492
01:24:00,560 --> 01:24:03,240
You turned out to be
the worst piece of shit

1493
01:24:03,280 --> 01:24:05,200
than I ever expected.

1494
01:24:05,240 --> 01:24:06,640
But I forgive you now, husband.
