00:01:47,982 --> 00:01:50,997
Cemetery of Viterbo

2
00:02:17,276 --> 00:02:21,983
- Are you OK?
- Give your hand!

3
00:02:40,861 --> 00:02:46,625
Oscar De La Valle

4
00:02:53,863 --> 00:02:55,571
Cut the chains.

5
00:03:27,773 --> 00:03:35,297
Bury it on the other side of the cemetery.
Later tonight.

6
00:03:36,099 --> 00:03:37,603
And the urn?

7
00:03:40,142 --> 00:03:43,529
- Put it on the car.
- Smile, Monsignore.

8
00:04:00,789 --> 00:04:08,278
Dear Michael, we have done a
discovery in the cemetery that worries me.

9
00:04:09,133 --> 00:04:13,120
I send you this urn to
examine the content.

10
00:04:13,759 --> 00:04:19,157
Knowing esoteric and paranormal sciencies,

11
00:04:19,158 --> 00:04:25,815
I think you'll be able
to confirm or deny my fears.

12
00:04:28,344 --> 00:04:31,435
Rome, Museum of Ancient Art

13
00:04:32,665 --> 00:04:34,259
Excume me, Sara, have you seen Michael?

14
00:04:34,954 --> 00:04:39,266
No, since a couple hours ago.
He took Paul to the doctor.

15
00:04:39,267 --> 00:04:41,924
Oh yes, that's why he doesn't
answer the cell phone.

16
00:04:43,248 --> 00:04:44,900
Do you want to see a thing?

17
00:04:44,901 --> 00:04:46,014
What?

18
00:04:46,015 --> 00:04:48,090
Come with me. Come on!

19
00:04:50,457 --> 00:04:52,190
What is it?

20
00:04:52,923 --> 00:04:53,888
Now you'll see.

21
00:04:53,889 --> 00:04:57,718
- I have never seen anything like this.
- Really?

22
00:04:59,163 --> 00:05:01,029
Don't make me curious.
What is it?

23
00:05:01,030 --> 00:05:02,960
Well, it's an urn.

24
00:05:02,961 --> 00:05:05,450
- An urn?
- Yes.

25
00:05:11,067 --> 00:05:12,798
- Where does it come from?
- From Viterbo.

26
00:05:12,799 --> 00:05:14,728
Monsignore Brusca sends it.

27
00:05:14,729 --> 00:05:19,053
It was found in a box buried in 1815.

28
00:05:21,483 --> 00:05:22,760
Isn't it nice?

29
00:05:22,761 --> 00:05:25,373
- I have never seen anything like this.
- Neither myself.

30
00:05:29,291 --> 00:05:33,132
- It's for Michael.
What does it say?

31
00:05:33,133 --> 00:05:34,611
Do we open it without him?

32
00:05:34,612 --> 00:05:36,176
I don't think he minds.

33
00:05:37,878 --> 00:05:40,626
Let's see what's inside and after
we put the letter back.

34
00:05:40,627 --> 00:05:42,227
- OK.
- Agreed.

35
00:05:42,228 --> 00:05:43,874
Let' open here.

36
00:05:47,003 --> 00:05:49,006
- Shall I help you?
- No, I can do it.

37
00:05:58,797 --> 00:05:59,994
What harm!

38
00:05:59,995 --> 00:06:02,142
You cut,
Let me see it.

39
00:06:02,143 --> 00:06:04,812
- It a small cut.
- An accident.

40
00:06:04,813 --> 00:06:07,649
Be cool.

41
00:06:11,032 --> 00:06:13,063
- Let's open it
- Yes.

42
00:06:24,543 --> 00:06:26,351
It's beautiful.

43
00:06:27,408 --> 00:06:29,283
Grab the dagger with care..

44
00:06:31,657 --> 00:06:35,421
- It's from the medieval age.
- Yeah, thirteenth century.

45
00:06:38,333 --> 00:06:42,143
- Three statues, they're creepy.
- Yes.

46
00:06:46,916 --> 00:06:48,612
Let's see what's this.

47
00:06:54,949 --> 00:06:56,410
They seem like demons.

48
00:06:58,177 --> 00:07:00,469
Look the inscription.

49
00:07:03,179 --> 00:07:04,767
There's one more thing here.

50
00:07:15,285 --> 00:07:17,505
It' a tunic, like talisman.

51
00:07:20,008 --> 00:07:21,747
Do you understand what's written?

52
00:07:21,748 --> 00:07:23,725
Not much well.

53
00:07:23,726 --> 00:07:25,751
They're ancient symbols.

54
00:07:25,752 --> 00:07:31,050
Sara, do me a favor, go and
bring me the Aramaic dictionary.

55
00:07:31,051 --> 00:07:33,714
- I'll take a look meanwhile.
- OK.

56
00:11:07,969 --> 00:11:10,769
Run!

57
00:11:31,751 --> 00:11:33,369
¡Help, help!

58
00:11:39,842 --> 00:11:43,996
Let's see, you have seen some people
But they were deformed.

59
00:11:43,997 --> 00:11:47,332
I didn' see well.

60
00:11:47,333 --> 00:11:51,519
- It was strange the way the moved.
- Why strange?

61
00:11:51,520 --> 00:12:00,087
It was like... they were devouring her,
all full of blood.

62
00:12:00,088 --> 00:12:02,181
Wait, try to describe it.

63
00:12:02,182 --> 00:12:07,650
I saw it for a few seconds.

64
00:12:07,651 --> 00:12:09,597
Not all people were deformed?

65
00:12:09,598 --> 00:12:10,945
Yeah, there was a monkey.

66
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:14,392
A monkey?

67
00:12:14,393 --> 00:12:15,870
It followed me.

68
00:12:22,066 --> 00:12:25,944
What exactly do you do at the Institute, Sara?

69
00:12:25,945 --> 00:12:29,882
I specialize in restoring archaeology.

70
00:12:31,556 --> 00:12:37,693
Have you already catalogued the
things found in the box?

71
00:12:37,694 --> 00:12:41,757
No, I have not yet been able to examine them.

72
00:12:43,284 --> 00:12:47,370
That is all I kno, I wish
to go home, please.

73
00:12:51,184 --> 00:12:53,371
- Sarah, how are you?
- Oh, Michael!

74
00:12:56,587 --> 00:13:00,140
I am Michael Pierce,
Director of the Museum.

75
00:13:00,141 --> 00:13:02,216
Enzo Marchi, I lead the investigation.

76
00:13:02,217 --> 00:13:05,768
- I'll take her home.
- Sure, no problem.

77
00:13:11,695 --> 00:13:17,367
I cant' believe it.
She's nuts.

78
00:13:18,741 --> 00:13:21,987
- Will you be investigator or not?
- Sure.

79
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:39,415
Can I go too? I do not want to be
alone tonight.

80
00:13:42,298 --> 00:13:43,437
Of course you can.

81
00:13:46,662 --> 00:13:51,708
It's freezing outside.
Do I light the fire?

82
00:13:52,850 --> 00:13:55,876
Yes, I'll take a look to Paul.

83
00:14:11,070 --> 00:14:12,699
He's in bed and quiet. He's sleeping.

84
00:14:22,221 --> 00:14:24,404
It happened to me one thing
really strange this afternoon.

85
00:14:26,837 --> 00:14:29,134
It's embarrasing for me
to tell you.

86
00:14:29,135 --> 00:14:29,893
What is it?

87
00:14:29,894 --> 00:14:32,094
Swear you won't say I'm crazy.

88
00:14:32,095 --> 00:14:33,181
I swear it.

89
00:14:36,011 --> 00:14:41,247
There was something inside there. I was not sure
to leave alive. Believe me.

90
00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:50,461
- It doesn't matter.
- Come on. Tell me.

91
00:14:50,462 --> 00:14:56,939
I felt a voice inside me.

92
00:14:56,940 --> 00:15:03,302
In my head. And suddenly, BAM!,
the doors were opened alone.

93
00:15:03,303 --> 00:15:06,214
And they were deadlocked.

94
00:15:06,215 --> 00:15:11,739
It was a woman's voice that I could remember.

95
00:15:11,740 --> 00:15:15,715
Hey, tiger, what are you doing awake?

96
00:15:18,676 --> 00:15:21,033
- Hi, Paul
- Hi, Sarah

97
00:15:21,034 --> 00:15:23,448
- Do you want a hot chocolate?
- Yeah.

98
00:15:23,449 --> 00:15:27,359
- Can I read a book?
- All right.

99
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:30,905
Get the book and take it to your bed.

100
00:15:30,906 --> 00:15:35,291
Which one do you want? This one?
I'll bring you the chocolate in a minute.

101
00:15:41,819 --> 00:15:45,717
I do not understand why.
Why was Giselle killed?

102
00:15:45,718 --> 00:15:49,178
What was the important
thing in the urn?

103
00:15:51,197 --> 00:15:58,740
It was a kind of talisman. Tomorrow I'll see Monsignor
Brusco and I hope he'll know something.

104
00:15:58,741 --> 00:16:00,533
How do you know him?

105
00:16:00,534 --> 00:16:07,662
I took a course on spiritualism. He was a real
authority on mysticism and the occult.

106
00:16:08,488 --> 00:16:12,492
Do you believe such foolishness?

107
00:16:12,493 --> 00:16:17,355
- The occult? - Yes
- Well, some things yes, others not.

108
00:16:21,773 --> 00:16:24,089
Don't you believe in what we fail to understand?

109
00:16:24,090 --> 00:16:25,837
Not really, no.

110
00:16:25,838 --> 00:16:31,506
You and I are scientists and must
only believe in what we can see and touch.

111
00:16:43,847 --> 00:16:45,920
I still hear that voice.

112
00:16:45,921 --> 00:16:47,958
It stillI resonates in my head

113
00:16:52,119 --> 00:16:53,653
Am I becoming crazy?

114
00:16:54,729 --> 00:16:56,061
No, Sarah, stay calm.

115
00:16:59,631 --> 00:17:04,240
Just rest.

116
00:20:14,274 --> 00:20:16,343
- Good morning, Father.
- Good morning.

117
00:20:16,344 --> 00:20:18,999
I would like to see Monsignor Brusco.

118
00:20:19,959 --> 00:20:21,940
He's not well.

119
00:20:25,222 --> 00:20:27,686
He had an attack in the afternoon
we discovered the box.

120
00:20:30,151 --> 00:20:33,076
He was conscious only a few minutes
before the coma.

121
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:36,643
I'm so sorry.

122
00:20:38,192 --> 00:20:45,204
Although this is not the right time,
I need information on the box.

123
00:20:45,205 --> 00:20:51,058
I can't see the reason why
someone could kill for that urn.

124
00:20:51,059 --> 00:20:55,205
All I know is that there was a name
on the box: Oscar De La Vallé.

125
00:20:55,206 --> 00:20:57,427
Oscar De La Vallé?

126
00:20:57,428 --> 00:21:00,688
- Yes.
- Do you know who he was?

127
00:21:00,689 --> 00:21:08,492
Well, Monsignor believed that the main character was
a history of two centuries ago.

128
00:21:09,906 --> 00:21:13,355
Many people considered him just a legend.

129
00:21:13,356 --> 00:21:18,358
Brusco not. That's why he sent you the urn.
For you to confirm.

130
00:21:18,359 --> 00:21:19,962
Can you tell the story?

131
00:21:21,193 --> 00:21:26,723
En 1815, some workers were
restoring the Curia of Aosta,

132
00:21:26,724 --> 00:21:28,471
they discovered an urn,

133
00:21:28,472 --> 00:21:36,043
Inside there were various objects, including a
tunic believed valuable magic.

134
00:21:36,044 --> 00:21:40,734
some witnesses said that the tissue
began to shine intensely.

135
00:21:40,735 --> 00:21:43,613
And packs of wolves emerged from the forest.

136
00:21:43,614 --> 00:21:48,355
The wolves removed the bodies buried
and ripped them.

137
00:21:48,356 --> 00:21:52,170
The local authority ordered to take
the urn to the Vatican.

138
00:21:52,171 --> 00:21:54,968
Oscar De La Valle offered
volunteer to carry it.

139
00:21:54,969 --> 00:21:59,176
He was a gentleman of high lineage and
had permission to talk with the Pope.

140
00:21:59,177 --> 00:22:04,489
It was an unfortunate trip, in its wake,
the urn brought death and destruction.

141
00:22:04,490 --> 00:22:07,708
Children were dying...

142
00:22:11,854 --> 00:22:15,408
In many cities, he was refused to entry.
People had panic.

143
00:22:16,649 --> 00:22:19,730
When he arrived to Viterbo, he was
exhausted and sick.

144
00:22:19,731 --> 00:22:25,166
He went to the local Church and in six days
died of malaria.

145
00:22:25,167 --> 00:22:29,560
He was buried in a secret
place with the urn inside the box.

146
00:22:29,561 --> 00:22:32,412
The box was sealed with a crucifix.

147
00:22:34,203 --> 00:22:39,032
He spoke nonsense.

148
00:22:39,937 --> 00:22:41,554
He said things without meaning.

149
00:22:44,038 --> 00:22:52,559
Wait... He was writing this
when they had the stroke.

150
00:22:53,508 --> 00:22:55,549
It is the list of objects in the box.

151
00:22:59,245 --> 00:23:02,541
- Mater Lacrimarum
- Mater Lacrimarum... Yes.

152
00:23:02,542 --> 00:23:08,444
According to Monsignor, the urn and the objects
contained were magical.

153
00:23:08,445 --> 00:23:12,356
They belonged to a wicked witch
called Mater Lacrimarum.

154
00:23:12,357 --> 00:23:14,365
The Mother of Tears.

155
00:23:14,366 --> 00:23:26,768
What a pity... A man like him... Ending
his days believing nonsense.

156
00:23:30,334 --> 00:23:37,702
Monsignor should truly believe it. The ways of God
werel less mysterious to him.

157
00:23:37,703 --> 00:23:43,150
If Monsignor wrote this, some reason
should have. Stay calm.

158
00:23:46,902 --> 00:23:47,960
Goodbye, Father.

159
00:24:34,235 --> 00:24:37,779
Help, help!

160
00:27:10,257 --> 00:27:11,819
What happened?

161
00:27:11,820 --> 00:27:13,306
They have my son.

162
00:27:13,307 --> 00:27:14,535
But, what do you say?

163
00:27:14,536 --> 00:27:21,301
They killed the nanny.
They left a note.

164
00:27:21,302 --> 00:27:26,311
When I arrived I found this.

165
00:27:27,486 --> 00:27:32,085
If you want your child
keep the SILENCE.

166
00:27:33,081 --> 00:27:36,493
The SILENCE.
Michael I'm sorry

167
00:27:37,365 --> 00:27:39,689
I'm sorry, my love.

168
00:27:40,841 --> 00:27:43,504
- These symbols, I saw them on the urn.
- I know.

169
00:27:43,505 --> 00:27:47,800
They are that people, a
sect of black magic.

170
00:27:47,801 --> 00:27:52,297
Black magic?
Michael, I do not believe that...

171
00:27:52,298 --> 00:27:55,865
- Do you think those are a series of coincidences?
- I am not saying that.

172
00:27:55,866 --> 00:28:01,037
Giselle is dead, Brusco in an coma and
they have taken Paul.

173
00:28:01,038 --> 00:28:06,599
Everything started with the urn and the talisman.
They want me in SILENCE.

174
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:09,477
What is keeping the SILENCE?

175
00:28:09,478 --> 00:28:14,023
It is the dark returning to Rome.
Don't you realize?

176
00:28:14,024 --> 00:28:16,551
It is one thing clear. Come here.

177
00:28:17,589 --> 00:28:19,129
Now I will make you see. Wait.

178
00:28:23,483 --> 00:28:26,227
An epidemic of suicides,
52 in two days...

179
00:28:26,228 --> 00:28:29,093
A wave of violence
spreading throughout the city...

180
00:28:29,094 --> 00:28:31,971
Murder, arson, rape, vandalism...

181
00:28:31,972 --> 00:28:35,156
Michael, you are scaring me.

182
00:28:35,157 --> 00:28:38,223
I'll bring the box to Father Johannes.

183
00:28:38,224 --> 00:28:40,544
How do you think that this
Father can help?

184
00:28:40,545 --> 00:28:42,597
He is an exorcist, one of the last
recognized by the Vatican.

185
00:28:42,598 --> 00:28:47,284
He knows all about the occult and
he will help me to find Paul.

186
00:28:47,285 --> 00:28:50,548
- Why don't you go to the police?
- But what Police!

187
00:28:50,549 --> 00:28:53,346
Didn't you see how they treated you at the Museum?
Like if you were nuts.

188
00:28:54,861 --> 00:29:00,730
Michael, I also want to find Paul
but I do not think that this is appropriate.

189
00:29:00,731 --> 00:29:04,332
Paul is my son, Sarah!
Not yours.

190
00:30:09,199 --> 00:30:11,272
Three furies.

191
00:30:23,741 --> 00:30:25,581
Three graces

192
00:30:26,781 --> 00:30:29,823
Divinity with three heads.

193
00:30:35,399 --> 00:30:37,732
The Triad

194
00:30:38,618 --> 00:30:40,201
Why they are always three?

195
00:30:41,213 --> 00:30:49,160
Hello.
- Sarah, it's Michael.

196
00:30:49,161 --> 00:30:53,231
- Michael, where are you?
- No, wait, listen...

197
00:30:53,232 --> 00:30:56,897
- I need your help, Sarah.
- Sure, tell me what I should do.

198
00:30:56,898 --> 00:31:00,473
- Yes, look...
- Michael?

199
00:31:03,971 --> 00:31:06,053
I'm not listening, nothing.

200
00:31:09,766 --> 00:31:13,284
Sarah help me, help me.

201
00:34:14,997 --> 00:34:16,536
Concentrate!

202
00:34:20,652 --> 00:34:23,531
They won't be able to see you.

203
00:35:07,932 --> 00:35:10,400
We lost her

204
00:38:54,987 --> 00:39:01,299
Sarah Mandy killed this guy because
she was been followed.

205
00:39:07,081 --> 00:39:14,961
Miss Mandy weighed about 50 kilograms and that
type was a kind of gorilla.

206
00:39:14,962 --> 00:39:16,800
And he was armed.

207
00:39:18,003 --> 00:39:22,792
I dont think she was
Take him.

208
00:40:06,896 --> 00:40:12,147
Good morning, I am looking for a
friend, Michael Pierce.

209
00:40:12,148 --> 00:40:14,200
He came to meet
Father Johannes.

210
00:40:14,201 --> 00:40:16,485
No, sorry, he's not here.

211
00:40:16,486 --> 00:40:20,739
What!... Could I see Father Johannes now,
It's very important.

212
00:40:20,740 --> 00:40:25,373
Maybe he'll come back tomorrow,
he had a lot to do.

213
00:40:25,374 --> 00:40:28,877
Tomorrow is impossible. Please, I swear
That it will not be long.

214
00:40:59,797 --> 00:41:01,737
It seems that you have done a tiring journey.

215
00:41:05,283 --> 00:41:09,485
I met your mother.

216
00:41:11,447 --> 00:41:14,286
You are Elisa's daughter, Mandy. Is it truth?

217
00:41:15,111 --> 00:41:17,887
My name is Marta Colussi.

218
00:41:22,682 --> 00:41:25,013
You really look like her so much.

219
00:41:27,696 --> 00:41:30,739
I met your mother many years ago.

220
00:41:30,740 --> 00:41:31,874
In Germany

221
00:41:31,875 --> 00:41:35,433
From her I learned so much.

222
00:41:35,434 --> 00:41:38,670
She was a great teacher,
a great spititualist.

223
00:41:38,671 --> 00:41:41,400
The best that I have ever met.

224
00:41:41,401 --> 00:41:42,933
My mother was a dancer.

225
00:41:42,934 --> 00:41:44,533
She was a good actress.

226
00:41:45,734 --> 00:41:47,126
A white witch.

227
00:41:48,299 --> 00:41:52,494
And from your father, you have inherited
some of his talents.

228
00:41:52,495 --> 00:41:55,217
- But what dou you say?
- Call me Martha.

229
00:41:58,120 --> 00:42:00,125
I did not come here to talk to you.

230
00:42:00,126 --> 00:42:02,490
Leave me in peace, understood?

231
00:42:03,639 --> 00:42:05,388
How could you escape at the station?

232
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,090
But... what do you say?

233
00:42:11,605 --> 00:42:14,236
Elisa gave you a hand.

234
00:42:14,979 --> 00:42:16,144
She guided you.

235
00:42:16,628 --> 00:42:17,415
Didn't she?

236
00:42:19,621 --> 00:42:20,443
I don't know.

237
00:42:20,444 --> 00:42:24,664
I've felt... a voice.

238
00:42:27,668 --> 00:42:29,403
Did you really know my mother?

239
00:42:29,404 --> 00:42:33,904
Fairly well. You do not know
much of her, right?

240
00:42:33,905 --> 00:42:38,188
Not. I remember very little of her.

241
00:42:39,064 --> 00:42:42,081
I was a childl when she died.

242
00:42:42,885 --> 00:42:45,296
In the accident at Freiburg.

243
00:42:46,491 --> 00:42:51,546
No, dear, I am sorry, it
wasn't that way.

244
00:42:54,391 --> 00:42:57,811
Your parents were killed.

245
00:42:57,812 --> 00:43:03,054
What? It is not possible.
Nobody told me that.

246
00:43:03,881 --> 00:43:05,031
What do you know?

247
00:43:09,914 --> 00:43:14,330
Your mother battled a powerful
Black witch.

248
00:43:15,406 --> 00:43:18,841
Mater Suspiriorum.
The Mother of Sighs.

249
00:43:18,842 --> 00:43:21,023
The Mother of Sighs?

250
00:43:28,596 --> 00:43:32,135
Father Johannes, how many drops?

251
00:43:32,136 --> 00:43:33,749
Twenty, thank you.

252
00:43:34,642 --> 00:43:37,402
You're not well, you should rest.

253
00:43:37,403 --> 00:43:40,578
I cannot with what is happening!

254
00:43:42,176 --> 00:43:44,094
Take the drops.

255
00:43:52,806 --> 00:43:54,449
I have waited for you a long time.

256
00:43:55,310 --> 00:43:57,659
- Are you Sarah?
- Yes.

257
00:43:58,661 --> 00:44:12,497
Their existence is a new
world you do not know.

258
00:44:12,498 --> 00:44:19,631
2000 years ago, witchcraft emerged
from the Black sea.

259
00:44:19,632 --> 00:44:27,686
Three sisters have wandered the world
bringing death and destruction.

260
00:44:29,123 --> 00:44:35,364
Researching in art history books I
came to discover that

261
00:44:35,365 --> 00:44:39,923
Mater Suspiriorum
established in Freiburg...

262
00:44:39,924 --> 00:44:45,130
Mother of Darkness, Mater Tenebrarum,
in Nueva York,

263
00:44:45,131 --> 00:44:48,577
Mater Lacrimarum will come to Rome.

264
00:44:48,578 --> 00:44:53,138
They call her the Mother of Tears and she's the most
beautiful and the most cruel of the three.

265
00:44:53,139 --> 00:45:01,543
And she's the only invict. Mater Tenebrarum and
Mater Suspiriorum are dead for years.

266
00:45:01,544 --> 00:45:05,365
The Mother of Sighs is the one that killed my parents.

267
00:45:05,366 --> 00:45:13,476
Yes, your mother fought bravely
but she could not stop her.

268
00:45:15,141 --> 00:45:21,119
A young dancer, Suzy Banion, could kill her.

269
00:45:22,047 --> 00:45:30,701
The opening of the box found by Brusco
returned the power to the Mother of Tears.

270
00:45:30,702 --> 00:45:32,472
Who told that to you?

271
00:45:33,443 --> 00:45:37,672
Your friend Michael spoke to me by phone

272
00:45:37,673 --> 00:45:44,324
about a tunic which is a magical
and powerful talisman.

273
00:45:44,325 --> 00:45:49,785
I have had visions. Witches from all around the world
have come to celebrate her return.

274
00:45:51,029 --> 00:45:56,807
They arrive by air, by train, by car...

275
00:45:58,087 --> 00:46:00,890
They want Rome to fall again.

276
00:46:00,891 --> 00:46:04,540
They want to inaugurate the second
era of witches.

277
00:46:05,370 --> 00:46:08,375
Sorry, Father, I am confused

278
00:46:08,376 --> 00:46:14,055
It is not your mind, it's the world that is sick.

279
00:46:15,842 --> 00:46:16,967
Come and see.

280
00:46:21,950 --> 00:46:26,724
Only I have a case of exorcism per month.

281
00:46:26,725 --> 00:46:32,316
In recent days I have faced more than
throughout my life.

282
00:46:36,192 --> 00:46:38,026
Why all this?

283
00:46:38,728 --> 00:46:42,374
The Mother of Tears spreads evil
all around her.

284
00:46:42,375 --> 00:46:50,276
A few killed, others are suffering,
she causes chaos and human despair.

285
00:46:52,646 --> 00:46:57,522
I have a book in my studio to borrow you.

286
00:48:22,274 --> 00:48:25,935
Mother, you have arrived!

287
00:48:33,147 --> 00:48:39,458
Sarah, here. Run!

288
00:48:58,696 --> 00:49:01,414
Run toward my car!

289
00:49:05,428 --> 00:49:06,613
Open, quick!

290
00:49:27,768 --> 00:49:29,525
Why they are all going for me?

291
00:49:29,526 --> 00:49:30,348
For your mother.

292
00:49:30,349 --> 00:49:32,491
Hey, what are you doing?

293
00:49:32,492 --> 00:49:33,485
I call Michael.

294
00:49:33,486 --> 00:49:36,110
Don't be stupid. They can trace you.

295
00:49:43,348 --> 00:49:45,686
You'll sleep with me me tonight.
At least you will be safe.

296
00:49:45,687 --> 00:49:50,114
No, I prefer to walk home.
Michael may go for me later.

297
00:49:51,835 --> 00:49:56,288
This is my number and my address.
It does not bother me, call me anytime.

298
00:49:56,289 --> 00:49:57,183
Thanks.

299
00:49:57,184 --> 00:50:01,450
You are the daughter of Elisa.
You are like family for me.

300
00:50:03,150 --> 00:50:07,146
I do not want to scare
you, but being who you are,

301
00:50:07,147 --> 00:50:09,575
you should not trust anyone.

302
00:50:09,576 --> 00:50:11,313
I promise.

303
00:50:16,821 --> 00:50:18,879
Wait, what's happening?

304
00:50:18,880 --> 00:50:20,877
They're burning the Church.

305
00:50:20,878 --> 00:50:22,980
The situation worsens.

306
00:52:30,155 --> 00:52:33,695
There was someone in my apartment, the light was
turned on. I saw it beneath the door.

307
00:52:35,557 --> 00:52:38,397
I beg you, help me, Martha!

308
00:52:38,398 --> 00:52:41,859
Breathe deep.

309
00:52:46,664 --> 00:52:48,810
Calm down.

310
00:52:53,362 --> 00:52:54,749
Helga, she is Sarah.

311
00:52:54,750 --> 00:52:55,911
Hi.

312
00:52:55,912 --> 00:52:58,447
- What is she doing here?
- Cool it, she's my friend.

313
00:52:58,448 --> 00:53:01,169
Please help me, I do not know what
is happening to me.

314
00:53:02,157 --> 00:53:04,431
Why all this to me? Why?

315
00:53:04,432 --> 00:53:07,880
Because being who you are, they
don't want to take risks.

316
00:53:07,881 --> 00:53:11,008
But... I am nobody. I know.

317
00:53:11,775 --> 00:53:15,416
No, you are more than you think.

318
00:53:24,064 --> 00:53:27,409
Helga, excuse us for a moment, please.

319
00:53:36,018 --> 00:53:37,843
You are gifted, Sarah.

320
00:53:37,844 --> 00:53:41,595
You must accept this fact,
If you want to survive.

321
00:54:07,272 --> 00:54:08,920
Observe.

322
00:54:26,590 --> 00:54:29,558
The spirits roaming...

323
00:54:29,559 --> 00:54:32,397
they are many, especially here in Rome.

324
00:54:34,935 --> 00:54:36,926
The old house is full of ghosts.

325
00:54:36,927 --> 00:54:42,124
Think well, the city
is 2700 years old.

326
00:54:42,125 --> 00:54:45,197
Underneath, there are five layers of cemeteries.

327
00:54:46,028 --> 00:54:47,500
How did you do that?

328
00:54:47,501 --> 00:54:49,238
You also can do it.

329
00:54:49,239 --> 00:54:52,256
With your skills, you see things
that others do not see.

330
00:55:03,160 --> 00:55:08,690
Collect all your energy and
concentrate at this point.

331
00:55:11,806 --> 00:55:16,757
Well, now lift the lid and blow.

332
00:55:41,063 --> 00:55:44,642
- Sarah.
- It can not be.

333
00:55:44,643 --> 00:55:49,828
- Sarah.
- Mamma!

334
00:55:49,829 --> 00:55:51,709
Do not touch her!
Or she'll disappear.

335
00:55:51,710 --> 00:55:55,913
Mater Lacrimarum becomes stronger.

336
00:55:58,266 --> 00:56:00,762
Where are you?

337
00:56:03,852 --> 00:56:07,995
You are in grave danger, my daughter.
Get ready for combat.

338
00:56:10,918 --> 00:56:12,952
Don't leave, mom.

339
00:56:16,239 --> 00:56:18,080
Marta, make her come back, please.

340
00:56:31,155 --> 00:56:34,346
She said that I should fight.
Please help me.

341
00:56:38,068 --> 00:56:45,652
I am only a medium.
I just can communicate with the spirits.

342
00:56:47,644 --> 00:56:50,036
I do not have your talent or your mother's.

343
00:56:52,925 --> 00:56:56,132
Now you need to be guided in the right direction.

344
00:56:57,593 --> 00:57:01,513
Tomorrow, I will introduce you to
Guglielmo DeWitt.

345
00:57:01,514 --> 00:57:03,209
He is a great Belgian thinker.

346
00:57:04,171 --> 00:57:06,231
- Okay.
- He will tell you anything useful.

347
00:57:12,807 --> 00:57:16,012
Thanks.

348
00:59:21,885 --> 00:59:24,203
Grab the phone!

349
00:59:37,755 --> 00:59:43,286
Hello! Marta! You must leave the house now!

350
00:59:43,287 --> 00:59:48,293
- Marta! Who is it?
- Escape! It is already late for her.

351
00:59:48,294 --> 00:59:50,675
Run! Now!

352
01:01:21,425 --> 01:01:22,067
¡Mater!

353
01:01:24,135 --> 01:01:25,359
Where is Sarah?

354
01:01:25,360 --> 01:01:27,445
He was not at home.

355
01:01:27,446 --> 01:01:28,873
Idiot.

356
01:02:11,235 --> 01:02:13,234
Be strong, be strong!

357
01:02:13,235 --> 01:02:16,391
- - Mom.
- Be strong, Sarah.

358
01:02:22,014 --> 01:02:25,097
Mom, what happened to Dad when...?

359
01:02:25,098 --> 01:02:28,791
It is a thing of the past...

360
01:02:28,792 --> 01:02:32,976
I am desperately angry with you.

361
01:02:32,977 --> 01:02:35,762
You have to be at my side, please
do not leave me again.

362
01:02:35,763 --> 01:02:39,442
My little Sarah, I can not speak now.

363
01:02:39,443 --> 01:02:44,282
Use your skills, use it well!

364
01:02:50,090 --> 01:02:53,222
We have to look for a girl called Sarah

365
01:02:53,223 --> 01:02:57,317
Mandy. If you found her,
comunicate immediately.

366
01:03:13,954 --> 01:03:14,913
Michael, come here

367
01:03:21,910 --> 01:03:24,645
What dou you have?

368
01:03:24,646 --> 01:03:26,068
Michael, you aren't well.

369
01:03:26,069 --> 01:03:28,724
Where is Paul?

370
01:03:36,045 --> 01:03:38,594
He's dead.

371
01:03:38,595 --> 01:03:43,519
- Oh, my God.
- They killed him.

372
01:03:43,520 --> 01:03:46,982
But you don't want to talk about that.

373
01:03:48,611 --> 01:03:53,712
- Come on.
- My home is not safe.

374
01:03:53,713 --> 01:03:57,479
We will go to my house and you'll
explain everything

375
01:04:02,456 --> 01:04:05,123
- Don't turn the light on.
- Why?

376
01:04:06,299 --> 01:04:10,974
They don't have to know that
we are here.

377
01:04:10,975 --> 01:04:13,405
I'm happy to found you.

378
01:04:15,413 --> 01:04:21,542
- This cough... give the jacket.
- No, no.

379
01:04:22,700 --> 01:04:26,103
I am cold. This house is frozen.

380
01:04:27,105 --> 01:04:35,661
Never went. I was followed.

381
01:04:37,832 --> 01:04:43,351
Now I know well.
Sorry I didn't believe you.

382
01:04:43,352 --> 01:04:44,839
I'm so sorry.

383
01:04:44,840 --> 01:04:46,737
It's all right.

384
01:04:47,813 --> 01:04:49,584
You shouldn't smoke.

385
01:04:49,585 --> 01:04:52,002
The cough...

386
01:04:53,166 --> 01:04:55,466
Do you want me to prepare you anything? A tea?

387
01:05:01,021 --> 01:05:02,077
No, I'm okey.

388
01:05:03,074 --> 01:05:08,108
I'm so happy I found you.

389
01:05:08,109 --> 01:05:12,359
Now I am calm. Really.

390
01:05:18,090 --> 01:05:19,928
Michael, you are bleeding.

391
01:05:23,531 --> 01:05:28,631
- You're a liar.
- How? It is true.

392
01:05:28,632 --> 01:05:31,124
No, I don't believe you.

393
01:05:31,125 --> 01:05:33,685
- You're a liar.
- But, what do you say?

394
01:05:33,686 --> 01:05:37,393
- Let me see.
- ¡Don't touch, you are a liar!

395
01:05:38,866 --> 01:05:41,193
I told you to put your hands apart!

396
01:05:49,573 --> 01:05:52,379
Did you think you'd lose respect for me?

397
01:05:52,380 --> 01:05:57,920
My son... how naive you are.

398
01:06:00,881 --> 01:06:02,300
What have you done to your son?

399
01:06:02,301 --> 01:06:03,301
Your mother will not help you anymore

400
01:06:03,302 --> 01:06:13,335
Now we all have a single mother,
the Mother of Tears.

401
01:06:15,158 --> 01:06:18,627
Witch, bitch!

402
01:06:49,515 --> 01:06:53,470
Find Guglielmo!

403
01:07:49,486 --> 01:07:53,337
We begin the news with what is undoubtedly
news of the moment...

404
01:07:53,338 --> 01:07:55,994
they call it the second fall of Rome...

405
01:07:55,995 --> 01:07:59,483
the city is witnessing hundreds
of violent acts...

406
01:07:59,484 --> 01:08:03,483
Commissioner Marchi, who do you
think that is behind all this?

407
01:08:03,484 --> 01:08:07,905
It all started with the events
at the Museum of Ancient Art in Rome.

408
01:08:07,906 --> 01:08:11,279
Yes, the brutal murder of the
vicecurator Giselle Mares.

409
01:08:11,280 --> 01:08:13,630
But what is the nexus?

410
01:08:13,631 --> 01:08:15,933
All that is what uleashed all this hell.

411
01:08:15,934 --> 01:08:18,591
All pay attention to this woman...

412
01:08:18,592 --> 01:08:20,066
Sarah Mandy...

413
01:08:20,067 --> 01:08:22,151
The only witness to the tragedy of the Museum.

414
01:08:22,152 --> 01:08:28,666
If someone sees her, don't try to stop her.

415
01:08:28,667 --> 01:08:30,573
Call the Police.

416
01:08:30,574 --> 01:08:32,547
Shit!

417
01:09:33,623 --> 01:09:33,623
Hi.

418
01:09:33,624 --> 01:09:35,933
I must talk with Guglielmo DeWitt.

419
01:09:37,352 --> 01:09:39,172
Sorry, who are you?

420
01:09:39,173 --> 01:09:41,035
You don't know my name.

421
01:09:42,706 --> 01:09:45,584
OK, come on in.

422
01:10:14,075 --> 01:10:17,075
Did you want to see me?

423
01:10:17,076 --> 01:10:19,022
Please, sit down.

424
01:10:19,023 --> 01:10:24,948
As you can see, I can't move very much.

425
01:10:24,949 --> 01:10:29,963
My friend talked to me about...

426
01:10:40,975 --> 01:10:47,759
Did you think that I din't reconize you, Sarah Mandy?

427
01:10:47,760 --> 01:10:53,046
And that the Police is looking for you
as a suspect of murder?

428
01:10:55,000 --> 01:11:00,025
One thing for us, the alchemists, is that
we just don't look at only one side.

429
01:11:00,026 --> 01:11:03,130
Of course, the white magic is a good thing.

430
01:11:03,131 --> 01:11:05,633
The black magic too.

431
01:11:10,218 --> 01:11:12,469
The things that we do are based on our
Artifacts. It's science.

432
01:11:12,470 --> 01:11:15,720
Esotericism, theosophy, laws of nature...

433
01:11:15,721 --> 01:11:19,575
a bit of this, a bit of that.

434
01:11:34,475 --> 01:11:37,504
This will exactly tell me
who you are.

435
01:11:37,505 --> 01:11:40,065
And what thing you have really been able to see.

436
01:11:42,897 --> 01:11:48,231
I see that you have this instinct similar
to the alchemists.

437
01:11:49,943 --> 01:11:52,141
Ah, you were sent by Marta Colussi.

438
01:11:52,142 --> 01:11:55,231
You have found your, Elisa Mandy.

439
01:12:06,485 --> 01:12:08,093
What have you done to me?

440
01:12:08,094 --> 01:12:14,368
What was your thought? That I would let you enter
my house without knowing who actually you are?

441
01:12:15,717 --> 01:12:20,268
Well, ¿exactly, why have you come here?

442
01:12:22,248 --> 01:12:24,018
I must find the Mother of Tears.

443
01:12:24,019 --> 01:12:25,063
Why?

444
01:12:25,064 --> 01:12:27,931
Haven't you seen what happens?
Rome is plunged into chaos.

445
01:12:27,932 --> 01:12:29,860
We must stop her.

446
01:12:29,861 --> 01:12:34,289
What do you think to do?
Kill her?

447
01:12:35,776 --> 01:12:40,137
Well, my mother was a powerful woman.

448
01:12:40,138 --> 01:12:43,176
And I think I have some of her powers.

449
01:12:43,177 --> 01:12:45,161
And when did you find that?

450
01:12:47,724 --> 01:12:49,785
I don't know.

451
01:12:49,786 --> 01:12:52,860
If you think in something,
you must give a hand.

452
01:12:55,664 --> 01:13:02,923
Father Johannes said that she wants to start
the second era of the witches.

453
01:13:02,924 --> 01:13:08,973
He was right. It already
started in the city.

454
01:13:08,974 --> 01:13:16,971
It will be necessary more than a single good witch
to face her. You should seek help.

455
01:13:16,972 --> 01:13:19,141
What do you mean?
That I'm alone?

456
01:13:19,142 --> 01:13:24,818
I can't give you answers, but
I can give you the information.

457
01:13:26,454 --> 01:13:31,527
We have to look to the roman alchemist
named Varelli,

458
01:13:31,528 --> 01:13:34,733
he lived long ago in this town,

459
01:13:34,734 --> 01:13:37,679
he was a talented architect,

460
01:13:38,514 --> 01:13:42,866
at the end of his life,
he built residences for the Three Mothers.

461
01:13:56,510 --> 01:13:58,679
Here are the things
you need to know

462
01:14:17,036 --> 01:14:17,871
The Three Mothers.

463
01:14:21,102 --> 01:14:27,867
I do not know how much it'll cost, but I'll get
what alchemists call SILENTIUM.

464
01:14:29,703 --> 01:14:37,054
We won't bribe profane minds
with our knowledge.

465
01:14:37,055 --> 01:14:41,829
I have met the Three Mothers, I
constructed for them three houses:

466
01:14:41,830 --> 01:14:45,319
One in Freiburg, one in New York and
One in Rome.

467
01:14:45,320 --> 01:14:51,828
Otherwise, I found a horrible secret...

468
01:14:51,829 --> 01:14:58,502
from there is where the Sisters will spread
pain, tears and darkness in the world.

469
01:15:02,782 --> 01:15:07,512
This design of the house is the one that Varelli
built in Rome.

470
01:15:09,945 --> 01:15:18,303
What you see, it doesn't exit.
what you don't see, it's the truth.

471
01:15:18,304 --> 01:15:20,163
It's an enigma

472
01:15:20,164 --> 01:15:24,557
Find the house of Mater Lacrimarum
and you'll have the answer.

473
01:15:28,496 --> 01:15:30,307
Are you sure to go on?

474
01:15:31,724 --> 01:15:33,248
You don't know how much.

475
01:16:45,146 --> 01:16:47,670
Stop here!

476
01:20:39,863 --> 01:20:41,428
Hey, who are you?

477
01:20:44,221 --> 01:20:46,132
I have seen a group of women coming in here,
did you see them?

478
01:20:46,133 --> 01:20:48,810
No, do you have something for me?

479
01:20:48,811 --> 01:20:51,898
Yeah, take.

480
01:20:51,899 --> 01:20:53,564
How long do you live here?

481
01:20:55,055 --> 01:20:58,978
So long... 30 or 40 years.

482
01:20:58,979 --> 01:21:03,628
I'm here since I escaped from the nazis
when the war ended.

483
01:21:04,349 --> 01:21:06,939
Can you tell me who
lived here before?

484
01:21:07,978 --> 01:21:14,971
I do not know... some sort of association of philosophers...
artists. I do not remember.

485
01:21:14,972 --> 01:21:16,595
Why did the leave?

486
01:21:17,541 --> 01:21:24,207
When the nazis came, they
took a lot of people.

487
01:21:24,208 --> 01:21:28,009
Hey, don't go in, I will denounce you!

488
01:21:46,905 --> 01:21:48,336
Listen.

489
01:21:59,143 --> 01:22:02,771
- She shouldn't go in.
- She went it so fast.

490
01:22:07,134 --> 01:22:10,093
I will look upstairs.
You watch here.

491
01:22:10,094 --> 01:22:11,618
All right.

492
01:22:20,475 --> 01:22:23,556
She's not here.

493
01:22:26,482 --> 01:22:28,827
You're an idiot, don't you remember
what I told you to do?

494
01:22:28,828 --> 01:22:36,406
Inform! From anybody coming in
here to browse around.

495
01:22:37,303 --> 01:22:39,365
- Is that clear?
- Yeah.

496
01:22:40,116 --> 01:22:42,339
Come.

497
01:22:55,059 --> 01:22:56,507
Where did the go?

498
01:22:57,509 --> 01:23:01,949
I can feel them.

499
01:23:15,016 --> 01:23:20,799
What you see, it doesn't exit.
what you don't see, it's the truth.

500
01:23:21,700 --> 01:23:24,291
The mystery of the house.

501
01:23:27,594 --> 01:23:30,325
These are the same signs that in the urn.

502
01:24:10,305 --> 01:24:12,368
We are in a secret catacomb.

503
01:24:21,586 --> 01:24:23,671
Oh my God.

504
01:24:27,470 --> 01:24:30,343
This is the house of the Mother of Tears.

505
01:24:31,271 --> 01:24:33,518
And her followers.

506
01:24:39,975 --> 01:24:42,702
- Witches.
- Witches?

507
01:25:14,050 --> 01:25:15,479
The Three Graces.

508
01:25:41,200 --> 01:25:43,499
What are you doing here?

509
01:25:43,500 --> 01:25:45,745
I'm an art researcher.
I came to visit the catacombs.

510
01:28:14,723 --> 01:28:16,386
Mater, give me the power!

511
01:28:40,395 --> 01:28:41,654
The tunic!

512
01:28:42,555 --> 01:28:44,540
Wonderful! Powerful!

513
01:28:44,541 --> 01:28:47,683
Mater, watch out!

514
01:28:47,684 --> 01:28:48,960
An intruder!

515
01:28:54,935 --> 01:28:56,223
Get him!

516
01:29:03,673 --> 01:29:07,772
We will eat you alive now.

517
01:29:14,032 --> 01:29:15,282
Get him!

518
01:29:16,898 --> 01:29:20,255
Our time is coming.

519
01:29:40,712 --> 01:29:42,645
Welcome, Sarah.

520
01:29:53,732 --> 01:29:56,830
Come closer.

521
01:30:08,160 --> 01:30:10,089
Come to me.

522

01:30:21,296 --> 01:30:28,516
We have been waiting
for this moment for a thousand years.

524
01:30:29,654 --> 01:30:34,388
Our power is here.

525
01:30:34,389 --> 01:30:39,987
Nobody will be able to stop us.

526
01:30:39,988 --> 01:30:41,784
Nobody no more!

527
01:30:54,294 --> 01:30:56,086
¡Nooooo, bitch!

528
01:32:57,368 --> 01:33:01,407
¡Sarah, it's me, calm down!

529
01:33:01,408 --> 01:33:06,454
Give me your hand, come on!

530
01:33:06,455 --> 01:33:11,065
Stay calm!

531
01:33:17,624 --> 01:33:20,424
Get out, get out.
