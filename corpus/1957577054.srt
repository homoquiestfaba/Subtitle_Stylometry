well it wasn't always
a restaurant there

46
00:03:15,799 --> 00:03:19,639
used to be a house
built in 1926 or so

47
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:21,798
but now in the 1950s
there was a bunch

48
00:03:21,799 --> 00:03:23,718
of college kids
that lived there

49
00:03:23,719 --> 00:03:26,199
and uh one day
one of the kids uh

50
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:29,319

52
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:31,799
mean

00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:34,518
so he took his father's
service revolver

54
00:03:34,519 --> 00:03:36,599
wrapped his
lips around it

55
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:39,078

the business
end of a pistol

105
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:28,519
this may be the
epicenter of the

106
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:30,118
paranormal activity
that has haunted

107
00:05:30,119 --> 00:05:33,239
this building ever since

108
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:39,640

109
00:05:40,119 --> 00:05:41,319
evp

110
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:44,199
navy p electronic
voice phenomenon is a

111
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:45,559
way the spirits
communicate through

112
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:47,159
electronic devices

113
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:49,398
the microphones
pick up things that

114
00:05:49,399 --> 00:05:52,280
we just can't hear

115
00:05:53,239 --> 00:05:57,200

okay okay

120
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:12,759
when a ghost or
spirit manifests

121
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:15,319
it creates
electromagnetic
energy that

122
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:17,719
registers on our
emf meters it's

123
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:21,200
stronger in here

00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:35,880

00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:34,439
One more mediocre

doing that

184
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:49,399
we need better locations

185
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:50,598

let's get to it the
ratings are slipping

236
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:59,319

because we were up

00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:01,239
against the ball
game this week

238
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:02,598
oh i think it's
because people are

239
00:12:02,599 --> 00:12:05,718
watching anything
but ghost sightings

240
00:12:05,719 --> 00:12:08,199

suck lately what

241
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:10,999

do to produce better

264
00:12:53,479 --> 00:12:56,038
shows and to see
something there are a

265
00:12:56,039 --> 00:12:58,439
lot of great locations
out there that we

266
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:01,399
can't get to
because of budget

267
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:03,239

00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:04,759

00:13:41,719 --> 00:13:45,079
we can't schedule

emails we've gotten
over the last three

347
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:37,639
months i've highlighted

348
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:39,319
only 12 of the 98
that sound like they

349
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:41,398
have potential but
i've weeded out the

350
00:16:41,399 --> 00:16:43,319
obvious fakes
the people who

351
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:45,239
want their 15 minutes
and the possible

352
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:47,158
crazies but i think
that those 12 are an

353
00:16:47,159 --> 00:16:48,999
interesting start so
check them out on

354
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,359

It's like a giant
degasser i don't know

363
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:09,719
what that is

364
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:11,479
basically it
neutralizes the

365
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:13,638
electromagnetic
energy in a room

366
00:17:13,639 --> 00:17:14,679

i'm ben gaffney
i have a bit of a

398
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:24,679
a ghost problem

399
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:27,479
i understand you
fix that sort of thing

400
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:30,039
we investigate that
sort of thing fixing

401
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:30,840
is

402
00:18:30,841 --> 00:18:32,279
That's something else

403
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:33,559
i don't think i
understand the

404
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:35,079
difference

405
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:36,599
well we have to
figure out what the

406
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:38,599
problem is first

407
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:41,079
is it an act
of haunting or

408
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:43,399
residual energy
sometimes it's nothing

409
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:46,519
electrical anomalies
nearby power lines

410
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:47,480
oh

411
00:18:47,481 --> 00:18:51,879
I can assure you
this is no anomaly

412
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:56,039
what makes you say that

413
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:58,919
this has been
going on for years

414
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:01,559
i used to just
accept it but as i get

415
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:03,559
older

416
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:04,599
it's

417
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:06,679
taken quite a toll on me

418
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:09,559
spirits sometimes
attach themselves to

419
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:11,479
people it's not uncommon

420
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:12,440
but

421
00:19:12,441 --> 00:19:13,639
most of the time
these things are

422
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:16,640
harmless

423
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:22,440
does this look harmless

424
00:19:22,759 --> 00:19:25,799
whatever it is i
believe it won't rest

425
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:28,039
until i'm gone

426
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:29,959
and

427
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:31,639
who knows

428
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:35,720
maybe even that
it'll torment me

429
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:37,319
um

430
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:39,159

where the energy

436
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:51,720
originates from

437
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:54,199

i wouldn't go there

haunted properties

00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:31,799

00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:21,319
penitentiary where

dozens of old souls
are sentenced to

630
00:28:23,239 --> 00:28:25,238

men were sentenced
to life in hell here

636
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:41,799
behind these walls
where some say even

637
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:43,399
though the facility
closed a dozen years

638
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:46,199
ago tormented
entities still remain

639
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:48,358
incarcerated

640
00:28:48,359 --> 00:28:52,040

649
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:27,478
folks around here

650
00:29:27,479 --> 00:29:28,598
about it much

651
00:29:28,599 --> 00:29:30,439
we noticed

652
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:32,279
yeah these things
have a way of finding

653
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:33,080
us

654
00:29:33,081 --> 00:29:34,758
People call looking
for help we hear

655
00:29:34,759 --> 00:29:37,159
there's a lot of
activity here so

656
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:38,439
you signed all the

leaving los angeles

00:29:46,119 --> 00:29:47,878
head on back home

662
00:29:47,879 --> 00:29:49,478
but they say this
generates revenue for

663
00:29:49,479 --> 00:29:52,279
the town so i'll
do what i'm told

664
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:53,799

00:29:57,640 --> 00:29:59,799

669
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:03,639
dark and just do our
thing sounds good

670
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:04,839
especially the part
about getting the

671
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:08,320
outboard dark

672
00:30:21,590 --> 00:30:24,699
[Music]

673
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:28,039
we are here with
resident expert clive

674
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:29,799
daniels who is going
to show us around

675
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:32,039
the freeling state
penitentiary and tell

676
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:34,279
us stories of its
haunting past and its

677
00:30:34,280 --> 00:30:35,799
haunted present

678
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:37,878
clive thanks for
being here so how old

679
00:30:37,879 --> 00:30:39,519
is this place
it's built in the

680
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:41,719
mid-1800s actually
used until about 10

681
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:43,719
years ago the repairs
got too expensive

682
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:44,998
now they just don't
have funding to

683
00:30:44,999 --> 00:30:46,839
either keep her
up or tear her down

684
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:48,839
right now prisons
uh tend to hold a lot

685
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:51,878
of negative energy
uh an emotional time

686
00:30:51,879 --> 00:30:54,279
capsule of sorts
which makes them very

687
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:56,199
active in paranormal
activity would you

688
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:57,639
agree

689
00:30:57,640 --> 00:30:58,919
well

690
00:30:58,920 --> 00:31:00,919
a hundred years if
murderers and rapists

691
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:02,279
locked inside a
box will do that i

692
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:06,199
suppose get
stabbings killings

693
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:08,439
suicides

694
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:10,358
prison seems to
bring out the worst in

695
00:31:10,359 --> 00:31:11,959
people and not
just the inmates but

696
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:14,919
sometimes the
guards administrators

697
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:16,519
what i mean is there
are these stories

698
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:18,358
about this doctor
that used to work here

699
00:31:18,359 --> 00:31:19,799
a long time ago

700
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:22,279
and he did all kinds of

701
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:26,039
unspeakable
things to the inmates

702
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:27,959
until he was caught

703
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:30,118
before my time
the rumor is that he

704
00:31:30,119 --> 00:31:32,758
wound up behind
bars himself

705
00:31:32,759 --> 00:31:34,998
but he didn't last long

706
00:31:34,999 --> 00:31:36,919
payback's a [ __ ]

707
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:38,679
anyway it was a
dark time for the

708
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:40,919
institution
that's for sure

709
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:42,998
now obviously we're
here to investigate

710
00:31:42,999 --> 00:31:44,439
the paranormal
activity that's been

711
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:46,519
reported but you
are are you a believer

712
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:49,560
do you think this
place is haunted

713
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:51,878
let's go to the cell

714
00:31:51,879 --> 00:31:53,399
a lot of people have
had experiences

715
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:54,679
there

716
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:58,599
okay let me go to
this whole block cool

717
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:06,358
now this is probably
where most of the

718
00:32:06,359 --> 00:32:08,439
activity occurs voices

719
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:10,519
people being touched

720
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:12,199
we got a lot of
photos with those on

721
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:13,238
there

722
00:32:13,239 --> 00:32:16,199
what are they called
uh orbs oh or ja

723
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:17,959
right there uh balls
of light that some

724
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:19,718
people think are
spirit energy is still

725
00:32:19,719 --> 00:32:21,718
bound to this world
and people see

726
00:32:21,719 --> 00:32:23,478
figures sometimes

727
00:32:23,479 --> 00:32:24,679
shadows

728
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:26,118
we had a tour group
come through here

729
00:32:26,119 --> 00:32:29,159
once and and up
there on the third tier

730
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:31,959
they saw a figure
looking down

731
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:33,478
we think it was a
prisoner who died here

732
00:32:33,479 --> 00:32:34,998
in 1958

733
00:32:34,999 --> 00:32:37,718
ephraim chamberlain

734
00:32:37,719 --> 00:32:40,679
he's kind of a kingpin
in here yeah you

735
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:43,079
think his his
spirit's still here

736
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:44,598
i do

737
00:32:44,599 --> 00:32:45,959
he was sourced a
lot of trouble when he

738
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:50,040
was alive he
attacked a guard once

739
00:32:50,119 --> 00:32:51,399
he dragged him
into his cell and broke

740
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:53,319
his neck

741
00:32:53,320 --> 00:32:56,039
he bit off chunks
of flesh never eaten

742
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:57,878
half his face including
one of his eyes

743
00:32:57,879 --> 00:32:59,799
by the time
they got to it

744
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:01,639
the poor bastard
lived like that for a

745
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:02,919
while

746
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:04,919
that forgot his
come up and they

747
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:06,679
assigned him to
experimental therapy

748
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:08,919
with the good doctor

749
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:11,878
and that was
enough to break it

750
00:33:11,879 --> 00:33:13,079
after a few months
they found him

751
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:15,238
hanging in his cell

752
00:33:15,239 --> 00:33:16,919
well we'll definitely
get uh some

753
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:19,238
coverage here the
cell block and see if

754
00:33:19,239 --> 00:33:21,079
ephraim makes an
appearance we better

755
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:22,839
not hope too hard
the spirit's been

756
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:25,238
known to attack
people in here scratches

757
00:33:25,239 --> 00:33:26,519
and bites them

758
00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:28,519
one mean son of
a [ __ ] and that's to

759
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:30,358
put it mildly oh

760
00:33:30,359 --> 00:33:32,680
man

761
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:42,839
yep all right

762
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:45,639
oh boys and

763
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:46,679
set

764
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:48,519
so clive has this
property been

765
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:50,039
investigated before
because it seems

766
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:51,718
like just a gold
mine for paranormal

767
00:33:51,719 --> 00:33:53,639
activity oh yeah it has

768
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:57,478
sometimes nothing
happens but sometimes

769
00:33:57,479 --> 00:33:59,159
there was this this
amateur group that

770
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:00,519
came and spent
the night a few years

771
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:01,558
back

772
00:34:01,559 --> 00:34:03,558
and when we got them out

773
00:34:03,559 --> 00:34:04,999
let's put it this way

774
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,679
they were no
condition to talk about

775
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:10,079
what they found

776
00:34:12,279 --> 00:34:15,558
now a number of
murders occurred in here

777
00:34:15,559 --> 00:34:16,918
stabbings

778
00:34:16,919 --> 00:34:18,598
even a drowning

779
00:34:18,599 --> 00:34:21,078
drowning in a
kitchen inmate killed

780
00:34:21,079 --> 00:34:22,679
another inmate by
holding his head in a

781
00:34:22,680 --> 00:34:26,400
pot of boiling water

782
00:34:27,319 --> 00:34:29,398
nobody found it
for quite a while

783
00:34:29,399 --> 00:34:30,519
the funny thing was
there were a lot of

784
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:32,598
compliments on
the soup that night

785
00:34:32,599 --> 00:34:33,878
wow

786
00:34:33,879 --> 00:34:36,599
that's a joke

787
00:34:37,240 --> 00:34:39,239
people hear a lot
of noises in here

788
00:34:39,240 --> 00:34:41,318
throughout the
whole building in fact

789
00:34:41,319 --> 00:34:42,598
hear things like

790
00:34:42,599 --> 00:34:44,117
shackles jangling

791
00:34:44,118 --> 00:34:45,398
moaning

792
00:34:45,399 --> 00:34:47,798
cell doors opening
and closing

793
00:34:47,799 --> 00:34:49,399
they say whenever
you hear a cell door

794
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:51,239
open and close

795
00:34:51,240 --> 00:34:53,038
it's ephraim coming for

796
00:34:53,039 --> 00:34:54,919
somebody otherwise
he's just like

797
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:57,159
spending time in his cell

798
00:34:57,160 --> 00:35:00,119
he was like that
that peace in his cell

799
00:35:00,120 --> 00:35:02,038
can we see the infirmary

800
00:35:02,039 --> 00:35:03,318
yeah sure

801
00:35:03,319 --> 00:35:06,640
it's in the basement

802
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:16,200
oh it's crazy you should

803
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:23,360
well here we are the
bowels of the beast

804
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:27,318
the doctor did his work

805
00:35:27,319 --> 00:35:29,719
some say it's still here

806
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:31,239
all right let's go inside

807
00:35:31,240 --> 00:35:32,359
no

808
00:35:32,360 --> 00:35:34,038
I won't go in there

809
00:35:34,039 --> 00:35:35,479
every man has this
limit and i draw the

810
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:38,360
line at this doorway

811
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:42,919
what exactly was
he doing in here

812
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:44,199
well i heard that

813
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:46,359
he'd dope his victims up

814
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:49,959
put him in a an
insulin-induced coma

815
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:53,080
then do his experiments

816
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:01,959
i kind of got
the idea that

817
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:04,839
might be more therapeutic

818
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:06,839
if they could feel
what he was doing to

819
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:08,199
them

820
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:09,080
so

821
00:36:09,081 --> 00:36:10,679
He found some
way to temporarily

822
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:13,239
paralyze him by
injecting these poor

823
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:14,278
guys with

824
00:36:14,279 --> 00:36:16,278
something or other

825
00:36:16,279 --> 00:36:17,879
then he put him on
a ventilator so they

826
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:19,639
were breathing but
otherwise completely

827
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:21,558
awake so that

828
00:36:21,559 --> 00:36:24,519
they felt everything
that he was doing

829
00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:26,919
his experiments
made no sense

830
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:29,159
he sterilized some
inject them with

831
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:30,439
things like

832
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:32,599
ground glass

833
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:34,278
acid

834
00:36:34,279 --> 00:36:36,359
those are the lucky ones

835
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:38,359
his favorites he'd do

836
00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:39,879
you know

837
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:42,840
sexual things too

838
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:46,679
basically he would
rape and torture them

839
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:49,399
he called him
his fallen angels

840
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:51,798
over a period of
20 years or so they

841
00:36:51,799 --> 00:36:54,038
estimate there were
maybe 45 men that he

842
00:36:54,039 --> 00:36:56,839
raped tortured
and mutilated

843
00:36:56,840 --> 00:36:59,959
who knows if
it's even true

844
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:01,798

909
00:39:13,080 --> 00:39:14,599
you folks in l.a

910
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:17,239
bunch of dumb
biscuits out here

911
00:39:17,240 --> 00:39:20,960
but we're not in l.a

912
00:39:23,740 --> 00:39:31,740
[Music]

913
00:39:46,970 --> 00:39:52,620
[Music]

914
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,159
okay i think we have
every angle covered

915
00:39:57,160 --> 00:39:58,599
i have eight

916
00:39:58,600 --> 00:39:59,879
night vision set
up in all the major

917
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:02,119
rooms and hallways
i have an array of

918
00:40:02,120 --> 00:40:03,639
still cameras
wired to em field

919
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:05,879
detectors and you're
also gonna get the

920
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:08,199
wireless feed from
my handheld camera if

921
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:10,278
it moves appears
manifest generates

922
00:40:10,279 --> 00:40:11,639
energy

923
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:13,239
something will record it

924
00:40:13,240 --> 00:40:14,439
hopefully

925
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:15,479
hopefully

926
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:16,679
yeah come on man
i mean it's not your

927
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:18,439
first rodeo hopefully

928
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:20,119
all right well we've
got five times the

929
00:40:20,120 --> 00:40:22,278
gear so five times
the chance of

930
00:40:22,279 --> 00:40:24,199
actually capturing
something and we've

931
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:26,119
spent five times
the budget so if this

932
00:40:26,120 --> 00:40:27,479
bombs out our

i can't explain it

1255
01:00:21,080 --> 01:00:22,998
if we can check the
cameras we can cover

1256
01:00:22,999 --> 01:00:24,839
more ground we'll
find them someplace

1257
01:00:24,840 --> 01:00:25,959
those

1258
01:00:25,960 --> 01:00:27,399
those things drained
all the power out

1259
01:00:27,400 --> 01:00:30,278
of everything all the
cameras are down

1260
01:00:30,279 --> 01:00:31,798
okay

1261
01:00:31,799 --> 01:00:34,038
okay

1262
01:00:34,039 --> 01:00:36,998
gotta get out
there and find them

1263
01:00:36,999 --> 01:00:38,199
oh yeah

1264
01:00:38,200 --> 01:00:40,278
i say we should
just stay here

1265
01:00:40,279 --> 01:00:42,359
until daybreak i
don't think roger's got

1266
01:00:42,360 --> 01:00:45,080
that kind of time

1267
01:00:45,400 --> 01:00:49,279
he's probably in shock

1268
01:00:49,559 --> 01:00:52,439
his systems are
shutting down okay

1269
01:00:52,440 --> 01:00:53,719
and for all we know
burger's in the same

1270
01:00:53,720 --> 01:00:55,639
condition

1271
01:00:55,640 --> 01:00:57,079
we gotta

1272
01:00:57,080 --> 01:00:59,558
find him and find
a way out of here

1273
01:00:59,559 --> 01:01:00,440
let's

1274
01:01:00,441 --> 01:01:01,558
change the

1275
01:01:01,559 --> 01:01:03,639
dressings

1276
01:01:03,640 --> 01:01:05,079
beyond that i think
the best thing we

1277
01:01:05,080 --> 01:01:06,599
can do for him is

1278
01:01:06,600 --> 01:01:08,679
just get out

1279
01:01:08,680 --> 01:01:11,840
get help

1280
01:01:23,799 --> 01:01:25,159
what do you think
the girl at the diner

1281
01:01:25,160 --> 01:01:28,840
meant when she said
i can't have babies

1282
01:01:29,039 --> 01:01:32,599
ah i don't know um

1283
01:01:32,600 --> 01:01:34,439
she seemed no

1284
01:01:34,440 --> 01:01:38,278
she didn't seem
right you know but

1285
01:01:38,279 --> 01:01:41,880
we haven't been
able to get pregnant

1286
01:01:42,360 --> 01:01:44,119
she said that i have
ghouls inside me

1287
01:01:44,120 --> 01:01:46,919
maybe she's right

1288
01:01:46,920 --> 01:01:48,998
maybe this work

1289
01:01:48,999 --> 01:01:51,639
has infected us
in some way and

1290
01:01:51,640 --> 01:01:53,318
maybe we have ghouls

1291
01:01:53,319 --> 01:01:56,279
and demons and

1292
01:01:56,840 --> 01:01:58,439
they're inside us
and they prevented us

1293
01:01:58,440 --> 01:02:00,680
from

1294
01:02:01,319 --> 01:02:03,479
you know all
right all right

1295
01:02:03,480 --> 01:02:05,159
let's just let's just
get out of here

1297
01:02:07,640 --> 01:02:10,359

01:15:25,970 --> 01:15:33,970
[Music]

1498
01:15:52,040 --> 01:15:53,559
mr gaffney

1499
01:15:53,560 --> 01:15:54,999
i'm cold as [ __ ]
i'm gonna wait in the

1500
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:57,799
car cool this
won't be long

1501
01:15:57,800 --> 01:15:59,559
i was excited to get
your phone call you

1502
01:15:59,560 --> 01:16:01,719
said you completed
the investigation yes

1503
01:16:01,720 --> 01:16:02,680
we did

1504
01:16:02,681 --> 01:16:04,119
and you were right

1505
01:16:04,120 --> 01:16:07,159
this seems to be the
epicenter of a very

1506
01:16:07,160 --> 01:16:08,120
active

1507
01:16:08,121 --> 01:16:09,239
haunting

1508
01:16:09,240 --> 01:16:11,239
marvelous

1509
01:16:11,240 --> 01:16:13,398
not only did we get
audible evidence but

1510
01:16:13,399 --> 01:16:15,239
for the first time we

1511
01:16:15,240 --> 01:16:16,839
actually recorded
apparitional evidence

1512
01:16:16,840 --> 01:16:18,918
as well how interesting

1513
01:16:18,919 --> 01:16:20,358
come on inside i
want to see if you

1514
01:16:20,359 --> 01:16:24,160
notice a shift
in the energy

1515
01:16:33,720 --> 01:16:36,520
feels different

1516
01:16:37,320 --> 01:16:41,479
not like the old
days but different

1517
01:16:41,480 --> 01:16:44,120
the old days

1518
01:16:44,280 --> 01:16:47,479
yes i was employed
by the prison staff

1519
01:16:47,480 --> 01:16:49,159
physician

1520
01:16:49,160 --> 01:16:52,759
not a pleasant job
i can assure you

1521
01:16:52,760 --> 01:16:53,878
but

1522
01:16:53,879 --> 01:16:56,919
an honest paycheck

1523
01:16:57,960 --> 01:17:01,639
this was a busy
place back in the day

1524
01:17:01,640 --> 01:17:03,719
it was my job to
look after these

1525
01:17:03,720 --> 01:17:06,039
wretched creatures

1526
01:17:06,040 --> 01:17:09,719
ironic really keeping
them well unfit so

1527
01:17:09,720 --> 01:17:11,398
they could live
a long healthy life

1528
01:17:11,399 --> 01:17:14,520
while they waited to die

1529
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:20,200
i called them my
little fallen angels

1530
01:17:20,520 --> 01:17:25,160
made the work less
arduous somehow

1531
01:17:25,800 --> 01:17:27,639
is something wrong

1532
01:17:27,640 --> 01:17:29,239
uh

1533
01:17:29,240 --> 01:17:31,239
We heard a story
about the doctor

1534
01:17:31,240 --> 01:17:32,918
arrested here for

1535
01:17:32,919 --> 01:17:34,839
doing horrible things

1536
01:17:34,840 --> 01:17:38,359
but they say the
inmates killed him

1537
01:17:39,320 --> 01:17:41,959
it's an old institution
there are many

1538
01:17:41,960 --> 01:17:45,160
persistent rumors

1539
01:17:48,120 --> 01:17:50,918
besides these
were abhorrent men

1540
01:17:50,919 --> 01:17:52,679
they deserve their
fate wouldn't you

1541
01:17:52,680 --> 01:17:53,799
agree

1542
01:17:53,800 --> 01:17:56,759
if by fate you mean

1543
01:17:56,760 --> 01:18:00,279
mutilation and
torture and worse

1544
01:18:00,280 --> 01:18:02,520
then

1545
01:18:03,040 --> 01:18:05,719
no i'm thankful
that the spirits have

1546
01:18:05,720 --> 01:18:07,398
gone

1547
01:18:07,399 --> 01:18:09,239
now i can live the
rest of my life in

1548
01:18:09,240 --> 01:18:11,560
peace

1549
01:18:12,359 --> 01:18:14,599
i didn't say
they were gone

1550
01:18:14,600 --> 01:18:16,039
what

1551
01:18:16,040 --> 01:18:17,040
what did you

1552
01:18:17,041 --> 01:18:21,319
say isn't that why
you came here

1553
01:18:21,320 --> 01:18:23,559
mr gaffney

1554
01:18:23,560 --> 01:18:25,479
no one can fully
comprehend the

1555
01:18:25,480 --> 01:18:27,559
paranormal

1556
01:18:27,560 --> 01:18:28,759
most of the times
it's harmless but

1557
01:18:28,760 --> 01:18:30,519
sometimes it's not

1558
01:18:30,520 --> 01:18:33,319
in fact last night
we couldn't get out

1559
01:18:33,320 --> 01:18:37,560
because someone
put a chain on the door

1560
01:18:38,359 --> 01:18:40,358
i knew if there was
any weakness in you

1561
01:18:40,359 --> 01:18:42,039
you'd try to leave

1562
01:18:42,040 --> 01:18:43,719
i couldn't allow that
to happen wait a

1563
01:18:43,720 --> 01:18:45,398
minute

1564
01:18:45,399 --> 01:18:46,999
you locked us in

1565
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:49,079
i had to keep you
focused on the task at

1566
01:18:49,080 --> 01:18:50,759
hand

1567
01:18:50,760 --> 01:18:53,159
one of our team
members died we all

1568
01:18:53,160 --> 01:18:54,519
could have died

1569
01:18:54,520 --> 01:18:56,119
that's the trouble
with your generation

1570
01:18:56,120 --> 01:18:57,959
no veracity

1571
01:18:57,960 --> 01:19:00,279
you had a job to do
here young lady from

1572
01:19:00,280 --> 01:19:02,918
the sound of it you
failed excuse me dr

1573
01:19:02,919 --> 01:19:04,519
gaffney if it wasn't
for what you did to

1574
01:19:04,520 --> 01:19:06,279
your little fallen
angels they'd be able

1575
01:19:06,280 --> 01:19:09,159
to move on what i did

1576
01:19:09,160 --> 01:19:11,479
i pioneered
treatments that targeted

1577
01:19:11,480 --> 01:19:13,319
psychopathic
currents that ran deep

1578
01:19:13,320 --> 01:19:16,119
within these
these creatures

1579
01:19:16,120 --> 01:19:18,519
these were rehabilitative
therapies that

1580
01:19:18,520 --> 01:19:21,319
had never been tried
before or since for

1581
01:19:21,320 --> 01:19:24,358
good reason i
should be lauded

1582
01:19:24,359 --> 01:19:28,679
not vilified well
this is insane

1583
01:19:28,680 --> 01:19:31,559
i think we're done
here let's go joe

1584
01:19:31,560 --> 01:19:34,039
hold on hold on
hold on one second

1585
01:19:34,040 --> 01:19:37,159
maybe the good
doctor's right

1586
01:19:37,160 --> 01:19:38,999
he asked us to rid
him of these entities

1587
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:41,039
and we failed

1588
01:19:41,040 --> 01:19:44,599
indeed but there is
a way to help these

1589
01:19:44,600 --> 01:19:46,358
creatures

1590
01:19:46,359 --> 01:19:48,919

01:19:49,480 --> 01:19:51,800
