167
00:08:29,893 --> 00:08:31,660
We probably won't
        wake up tomorrow.

We can't keep going through
  dishwashers like paper plates.

169
00:08:34,064 --> 00:08:37,732
If I give him a place to sleep,
he's more likely to stay.

170
00:08:37,834 --> 00:08:40,769
- I don't understand you.
    - Oh, get in line.

171
00:08:40,871 --> 00:08:43,672
You've known travis
       for two years.

172
00:08:43,774 --> 00:08:45,140
He's the man
      that I want to marry

173
00:08:45,242 --> 00:08:48,276
but you wouldn't piss on him
  if he was on fire.

174
00:08:48,378 --> 00:08:50,745
You've known this deadbeat
    drifter a couple of hours

175
00:08:50,847 --> 00:08:52,414
and answer his prayers.

176
00:08:52,516 --> 00:08:55,584
I know people, joy. And
hopefully someday you will, too.

177
00:08:55,686 --> 00:08:59,321
Leave those.
Give me your feet.

178
00:08:59,423 --> 00:09:03,024
- Really? Oh, my god!
      - Uh-hmm.

179
00:09:03,126 --> 00:09:05,460
I was so hoping for this,
    but I was too scared to ask.

182
00:09:13,170 --> 00:09:16,004
- About my college money..
   - Ah! Joy, not again--

183
00:09:16,106 --> 00:09:19,140
I'm not asking
    for you to give it to me.

184
00:09:19,243 --> 00:09:20,942
But maybe I could borrow some?

185
00:09:21,044 --> 00:09:23,645
- Nice try, but no.
       - I'll pay it back.

And I assume my continuing
   to remind you

190
00:09:38,762 --> 00:09:41,429
that travis will bring
     nothing but misery

191
00:09:41,531 --> 00:09:43,231
will only drive you
       closer to him.

192
00:09:43,333 --> 00:09:44,833
Definitely.

193
00:09:44,935 --> 00:09:46,701
Great.

194
00:09:46,803 --> 00:09:48,670
Hey, I need you at breakfast.

195
00:09:48,772 --> 00:09:50,639
It's gonna be a busy day.

[indistinct singing]

198
00:09:59,149 --> 00:10:01,883
I tried.
Even said I'd pay her back.

199
00:10:01,985 --> 00:10:03,218
She's hanging onto her fantasy

200
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:05,387
that I'm gonna be
the world's greatest doctor.

201
00:10:07,224 --> 00:10:08,456
Maybe your family could--

I'm not taking anything
         from them.

203
00:10:09,893 --> 00:10:11,426
- They've got the money.
    - Yeah.

204
00:10:11,528 --> 00:10:13,094
And they'd make me pay for it
   the rest of my life.

205
00:10:13,196 --> 00:10:14,396
Okay, so..

206
00:10:20,637 --> 00:10:22,637
If we got married right away

207
00:10:22,739 --> 00:10:24,539

No, wait. Scratch that.

Why don't you have soy cheese,

I'm not a child, mother.

No, you're an adult and adults
have consideration.

That's part of what
makes them adults.

           you must be thinking.

338
00:18:05,668 --> 00:18:07,869
What a bizzare coindence

339
00:18:07,971 --> 00:18:11,038
that a grave dug to the
     exact dimensions of my body

340
00:18:11,141 --> 00:18:13,341
is out here in the
            middle of the desert

341

[travis grunts]

345
00:18:39,335 --> 00:18:41,702
I dug this hole
      the first day we met.

346
00:18:41,805 --> 00:18:43,871
Because I knew this day
     would happen.

347
00:18:43,973 --> 00:18:45,673
I knew you would hurt
      my daughter

348

     then have to kill you.

digging a grave in the desert

351
00:18:53,183 --> 00:18:56,217
but I'm here to tell you
    that's bullshit.

352
00:18:56,319 --> 00:18:58,419
This took me two days.

353
00:18:58,521 --> 00:19:00,188
There's nothing that
      a mother wouldn't do

354

 such a hard dug grave

Travis and I exercised
a robust exchange of ideas.

Mom, what happened?

391
00:22:21,791 --> 00:22:23,224
Travis said that he thought
it would be best

392
00:22:23,326 --> 00:22:25,126
if he left california entirely.

393
00:22:27,130 --> 00:22:29,163
You know who his family is,
     right?

00:22:29,265 --> 00:22:32,767
They're criminals, like,
        violent criminals.

And I'm gonna do whatever
I have to do to protect you.

01:08:15,375 --> 01:08:17,108
...Don't! Don't do that.

1185
01:08:17,210 --> 01:08:20,712
I-I can't. I don't,
I don't have a choice. Um..

1186
01:08:22,082 --> 01:08:25,016
And this, this is,
it's very sweet

1187
01:08:25,118 --> 01:08:26,985
but it's not happening again.

1188
01:08:27,087 --> 01:08:28,820
It's good.

1189
01:08:28,922 --> 01:08:30,221
And it's messy.

1190
01:08:30,323 --> 01:08:31,956
And I can't have clutter.

1191
01:08:33,627 --> 01:08:35,326
[scoffs]

1192
01:08:35,429 --> 01:08:36,995
okay.

1193
01:08:37,097 --> 01:08:38,463
You're the boss.

1194
01:08:39,232 --> 01:08:40,665
Exactly.

hey. Yup.

1198
01:09:03,790 --> 01:09:05,523
She's on the way.

1199
01:09:05,625 --> 01:09:06,758
Yeah.

1204
01:10:15,262 --> 01:10:18,496
- bellman brought this up.
  - Ah, okay. Alright, thanks.

1205
01:10:43,323 --> 01:10:45,356
- You can't stop me! Get away.
 - Ma'am. Ma'am.

     'but boss doesn't
     want to be disturbed.'

1207
01:10:47,694 --> 01:10:50,562
I'm his wife.

1208
01:10:50,664 --> 01:10:52,230
Baby.

1209
01:10:52,332 --> 01:10:56,000
- Think you could surprise me?
 - Who snitched?

1210
01:10:56,102 --> 01:10:58,036
Nobody can keep
     secrets from the boss.

1211
01:10:58,138 --> 01:11:00,038
You really set this up for me?

1212
01:11:00,140 --> 01:11:04,475
Baby. Baby. Baby, baby.

1213
01:11:04,578 --> 01:11:08,413
It's all for you.

1214
01:11:11,017 --> 01:11:13,551

he said he wanted to see me.

1219
01:11:54,394 --> 01:11:57,095
- Alright. You know the drill.
 - Yeah.

1220
01:12:03,737 --> 01:12:06,537
What the hell hazel?
            Hazel, really?

Ah..

It's hazel.

1226

[music continues]

1237
01:14:25,061 --> 01:14:27,161
come on, honey.
   We can work this out, huh?

1238
01:14:42,245 --> 01:14:45,313
After all we've been through,
  it can't come down to this.

I'm finally gonna be
      free of you.

01:15:20,650 --> 01:15:22,884
We're a good team.

1245
01:15:22,986 --> 01:15:24,886
A great team.

1246
01:15:24,988 --> 01:15:26,120
Don't let your..

1247
01:15:27,924 --> 01:15:30,958
Don't let your emotions
   take you down the wrong path.

1248
01:15:31,060 --> 01:15:34,262
This is the right path.
     It's the only path.

1249
01:15:34,364 --> 01:15:35,863
You need me, hazel.

1250
01:15:35,965 --> 01:15:37,999
You'd be dead a long time ago
  without me.

1251
01:15:38,101 --> 01:15:39,700
And I'm the only one
      that's gonna be there

1252
01:15:39,802 --> 01:15:41,335
when you slide back
       into the shit.

1253
01:15:41,437 --> 01:15:42,737
And you know you will.

1254
01:15:45,241 --> 01:15:47,775
You think joy's
             gonna stick around?

1255
01:15:47,877 --> 01:15:50,578
- Or elliot?
   - You think this is funny?

1256
01:15:50,680 --> 01:15:52,880
Elliot works for me.

1257
01:15:52,982 --> 01:15:54,882
If you don't believe me,
        you can ask him.

1258
01:15:56,753 --> 01:15:58,653
I own him like I own you.

1259
01:15:58,755 --> 01:16:00,888

And this is for joy.

1263
01:16:14,103 --> 01:16:14,969
And this is for me.

1264
01:16:15,071 --> 01:16:17,305
I saved your life.

1265
01:16:17,407 --> 01:16:20,575
The only good thing that
came out of what you made me

1266
01:16:20,677 --> 01:16:22,944
is that I can do this
and still live with myself.

1267
01:16:23,947 --> 01:16:25,546

javier, how much
      do I have to pay you

1279
01:18:58,434 --> 01:19:00,267
before you get a new van?

1280

That one runs<i> bien.</i>

1281
01:19:02,672 --> 01:19:04,038
How long you've been
      working for me?

1282
01:19:04,140 --> 01:19:07,708
Sixteen, no, seventeen years.

1283
01:19:07,810 --> 01:19:10,044
- Yeah.
  - Since my youngest was five.

1284
01:19:10,146 --> 01:19:11,679
Since joy was two.

1285
01:19:13,750 --> 01:19:14,915
I'm gonna buy you
       a new set of tires.

1286
01:19:15,017 --> 01:19:17,218
- No, no, no, no, no.
      - Yeah.

1287
01:19:17,320 --> 01:19:20,020
- For your loyalty.
      - You don't have to.

1288
01:19:20,123 --> 01:19:22,523
[speaking in foreign language]

1289
01:19:22,625 --> 01:19:24,959

loyalty, then what do we have?

1291
01:19:36,973 --> 01:19:38,339
honey, you don't have
   to do breakfast. I got it.

Oh, that's okay.

1293
01:19:39,742 --> 01:19:42,309
You had a long night
            and everything.

1294
01:19:42,411 --> 01:19:45,312
- How did it go?
        - Good.

1295
01:19:45,414 --> 01:19:47,982
- What about that debt?
     - Paid in full.

1296
01:19:50,186 --> 01:19:53,020
- Get any sleep?
        - No.

1297
01:19:53,122 --> 01:19:54,989
Will you ever tell me
           about it someday?

1298
01:19:55,091 --> 01:19:56,524
Sure.

1299

- Hey, mom.
          - What? Yeah.

1304
01:20:31,260 --> 01:20:33,761
- Can I borrow the broncho?
   - Now?

1305
01:20:33,863 --> 01:20:35,296
Some friends want me
to come over.

1306
01:20:35,398 --> 01:20:37,731
I won't be long.

1307
01:20:37,834 --> 01:20:39,266
What about break..

1308
01:20:40,369 --> 01:20:42,002
I'll have the denver omelet.

1309
01:20:42,104 --> 01:20:43,637
No, wait. Scratch that.

1310
01:20:43,739 --> 01:20:45,005
Now, on the denver omelet

1311
01:20:45,107 --> 01:20:47,107
can I substitute the
             ham for wheat germ?

If you hate yourself.

1313
01:20:49,045 --> 01:20:50,578

         a john denver concert

1314
01:20:50,680 --> 01:20:51,912
with me, hazel?

1315
01:20:52,014 --> 01:20:54,048
- I'd like that, willy.
     - Really?

1316
01:20:54,150 --> 01:20:56,750
- Because john denver's dead.
  - Oh. Right.

1317
01:20:56,853 --> 01:20:58,853
Was the denver omelet
      invented in denver?

1318
01:20:58,955 --> 01:21:00,788
- Phoenix.
        - Get outta here.

1319
01:21:00,890 --> 01:21:05,292
Uh-huh, in 1862, union general
 wade jefferson denver

1320
01:21:05,394 --> 01:21:08,062
created the, "denver omelet"
  in phoenix, arizona.

1321
01:21:08,164 --> 01:21:11,565
- Well, I'll be damned.
     - I made that up.

1322
01:21:11,667 --> 01:21:12,833
Why would you do that?

1323
01:21:12,935 --> 01:21:15,002
To spice up the day.
I don't know.

1324
01:21:15,104 --> 01:21:16,804
How about
         a kenny rogers concert?

1325
01:21:16,906 --> 01:21:18,439
Also dead.

1326
01:21:18,541 --> 01:21:19,640
Of course.
           What's wrong with me?

1327
01:21:19,742 --> 01:21:21,275
Can you do an egg
            white omelet, hazel?

1328
01:21:21,377 --> 01:21:23,878
I could, rudy,
      but I choose not to.

1329
01:21:23,980 --> 01:21:26,146
- Toby keith's alive.
      - His music sucks.

1330
01:21:28,150 --> 01:21:30,017
I don't even know
               what I want.

1331
01:21:30,119 --> 01:21:31,886
- Me, neither.
         - Me, neither.

1332
01:21:31,988 --> 01:21:34,154
Okay.

1333
01:21:34,257 --> 01:21:37,124
For the first time ever,
    we're going to introduce

1334
01:21:37,226 --> 01:21:38,559
breakfast roulette!

1335
01:21:38,661 --> 01:21:40,394
That's where I choose
      your meal at random

1336
01:21:40,496 --> 01:21:42,897
and you accept the result
    without complaint.

1337
01:21:42,999 --> 01:21:44,698
Okay?

1338
01:21:44,800 --> 01:21:46,367
Okay.

1339
01:21:46,469 --> 01:21:48,202
Willy. Sausage scramble.

1340
01:21:48,304 --> 01:21:51,438
Rudy. Blueberry pancakes.

1341
01:21:51,540 --> 01:21:53,574
Last but not least, carl.

1342
01:21:53,676 --> 01:21:54,909
Bacon and egg sandwich.

1343
01:21:55,011 --> 01:21:56,877
No substitutions.

1344
01:21:56,979 --> 01:21:58,545
That'll work.

1345
01:21:58,648 --> 01:22:00,214
Sure, yeah.

1346
01:22:00,316 --> 01:22:01,382
Sounds good.

1347
01:22:16,632 --> 01:22:18,999
- Where's javier?
- He went out back a while ago.

1348
01:22:22,204 --> 01:22:24,905
You and I are gonna need
  to talk at some point today.

1349
01:22:25,007 --> 01:22:26,173
Okay.
