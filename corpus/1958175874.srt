1
00:00:06,700 --> 00:00:08,740
Hey, everyone. I'm Clark Wolfe.

2
00:00:08,870 --> 00:00:10,700
And welcome to "Show
Me More", where we take

3
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:13,310
a behind the scenes look
at what went into creating

4
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:14,790
AMC's hit shows.

5
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:16,750
Before we get into
it, I should warn you,

6
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:19,100
there are lots of
spoilers ahead.

7
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:22,060
Now, if you're all caught
up, let's get into part one

8
00:00:22,190 --> 00:00:26,630
of the final season of
"Fear The Walking Dead."

9
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:28,760
Announcer: Presented
by T-Mobile.

10
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:38,210
Padre was a mystery for
most of season seven.

11
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:40,820
And what we did learn
about it at the end

12
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:43,130
with Morgan and Madison
was hardly encouraging.

13
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:44,910
Come on. She sounds scared.

14
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:46,870
Padre: Like all
the children here,

15
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,080
she will learn to separate
herself from her emotions.

16
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:51,000
Wolfe: Well, in season
8, we sure learned

17
00:00:51,130 --> 00:00:53,400
a lot more about Padre.

18
00:00:53,530 --> 00:00:54,936
You're doing this
for the same reason

19
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:56,660
we do everything. For Padre.

20
00:00:56,790 --> 00:00:58,310
Wolfe: Like who's in charge,

21
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:00,620
how the community survived
for over seven years,

22
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:05,580
and why you wouldn't exactly
call it a family friendly place.

23
00:01:05,710 --> 00:01:07,540
Not even close.

24
00:01:09,370 --> 00:01:11,280
Man: Who are we
learning this for?

25
00:01:11,410 --> 00:01:13,850
All: Padre!

26
00:01:13,980 --> 00:01:15,850
Man: Who sustains
our way of life?

27
00:01:15,980 --> 00:01:18,200
All: Padre.

28
00:01:18,330 --> 00:01:21,290
Goldberg: Padre is
our central settlement

29
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:25,040
that is well fortified,
on the water,

30
00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:28,080
where we find our
characters in season 8.

31
00:01:28,210 --> 00:01:30,090
Man: Who is teaching
us to be strong?

32
00:01:30,220 --> 00:01:31,300
All: Padre.

33
00:01:31,430 --> 00:01:33,090
Goldberg: When Padre started,

34
00:01:33,220 --> 00:01:35,260
it was in this altruistic place.

35
00:01:35,390 --> 00:01:39,180
It really was created
to rebuild the world.

36
00:01:39,310 --> 00:01:40,806
Chambliss: Padre isn't
just a group of people.

37
00:01:40,830 --> 00:01:42,710
It isn't just a settlement.

38
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:44,710
It really is a way of life.

39
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:47,360
We kind of thought of this
as kind of like a modern day

40
00:01:47,490 --> 00:01:50,500
version of Sparta, where Padre
is collecting all these children

41
00:01:50,630 --> 00:01:53,150
from the apocalypse, and they're
kind of like this blank slate

42
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:56,330
that Padre can teach
this new way of life to.

43
00:01:56,460 --> 00:01:59,640
Goldberg: They operate
on this philosophy of

44
00:01:59,770 --> 00:02:02,380
separating children
from their parents

45
00:02:02,510 --> 00:02:05,770
and raising them to not
have emotional connections.

46
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:07,616
Chambliss: Individual
relationships, individual wants

47
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:11,470
and needs are secondary to
the good of the community.

48
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:12,796
You're doing this
for the same reason

49
00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:14,220
we do everything.

50
00:02:14,350 --> 00:02:15,740
For Padre.

51
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:18,660
Goldberg: Children are
being raised to be strong,

52
00:02:18,790 --> 00:02:21,220
to be warriors, to
approach the world

53
00:02:21,350 --> 00:02:24,490
in a cold, brutal way.

54
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:27,140
However, there's something
that they grow up

55
00:02:27,270 --> 00:02:30,100
fundamentally lacking,
which is connection.

56
00:02:30,230 --> 00:02:32,760
Every time I look out
there. I feel like something

57
00:02:32,890 --> 00:02:34,850
really big is
missing inside of me.

58
00:02:37,890 --> 00:02:41,030
Goldberg: Our characters are
separated from the people

59
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:43,200
they care about, and
it's really redefined

60
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:45,550
who they are as people
in the seven years

61
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:46,900
since we last saw them.

62
00:02:48,770 --> 00:02:50,770
Who's that?

63
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:52,470
Madison: That's your dad.

64
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:55,820
Are you really my father?

65
00:02:55,950 --> 00:02:57,560
I am Mo...

66
00:02:57,690 --> 00:03:00,260
Wren. My name is Wren.

67
00:03:00,390 --> 00:03:02,700
Essentially, the kids
have been brainwashed.

68
00:03:04,310 --> 00:03:06,270
They believe their
parents abandoned them.

69
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:09,790
They believe that Padre has
their best interests at heart.

70
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:13,100
Padre. Can you hear
me? This is Wren.

71
00:03:13,230 --> 00:03:16,150
Man: Padre 1.
Wren, do you copy?

72
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:18,850
Chambliss: Padre is run
by these two traumatized

73
00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:21,590
young adults who are
doing all of this because

74
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:23,150
they lost their father.

75
00:03:23,290 --> 00:03:28,120
Don't let this die.
It's so important.

76
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:31,600
Goldberg: They believe they
are protecting other kids

77
00:03:31,730 --> 00:03:35,080
from the pain that they felt.

78
00:03:35,210 --> 00:03:37,210
I know the pain Wren's in.

79
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:40,520
The whole reason I am
doing what I'm doing

80
00:03:40,650 --> 00:03:44,390
is to prevent anyone else from
feeling that kind of pain.

81
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:48,050
Chambliss: There are, in some
ways, good intentions behind

82
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:50,440
Padre, but Shrike and
Crane have gone to this

83
00:03:50,570 --> 00:03:52,920
kind of very dark place.

84
00:03:55,270 --> 00:03:57,280
Woman: Wren, this
is to protect you,

85
00:03:57,410 --> 00:03:59,130
Eshet: Shrike and Crane,
they're extremists.

86
00:03:59,230 --> 00:04:03,630
They take very harsh actions
to keep their community safe.

87
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:05,410
Stop, please!

88
00:04:05,540 --> 00:04:07,370
Eshet: And they really
did manage to keep

89
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:08,810
this community going.

90
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:10,460
Just so you know, Red Kite,

91
00:04:10,590 --> 00:04:13,600
no one's ever stolen a
child from Padre before.

92
00:04:13,730 --> 00:04:16,250
Padre's philosophy has
been quite effective.

93
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:19,250
But there is a cost that
comes when you have to enforce

94
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:22,430
your ideology with
such extreme measures.

95
00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:25,700
Stop! Let her go!

96
00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:27,440
Get her out of here now.

97
00:04:27,570 --> 00:04:30,220
Padre really has to be careful

98
00:04:30,350 --> 00:04:32,960
about showing any
kind of weakness.

99
00:04:34,790 --> 00:04:36,490
Don't move.

100
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:38,880
Shrike: Call the prefect.
Tell them to get more guards.

101
00:04:39,010 --> 00:04:41,970
She's the reason Finch got bit.

102
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:43,670
Finch got bit?

103
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:45,980
They don't want to have a
bunch of kids wondering,

104
00:04:46,110 --> 00:04:47,800
wait, is it better out there?

105
00:04:47,930 --> 00:04:51,110
Are the parents that we've
been told didn't care about us,

106
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:53,240
were our enemies, are
they really our enemies?

107
00:04:53,380 --> 00:04:55,860
Those kind of questions are
the thing that Padre really

108
00:04:55,990 --> 00:04:57,510
has to try to snuff out.

109
00:04:57,640 --> 00:05:00,640
You wanted to ask
Padre for the truth?

110
00:05:00,770 --> 00:05:03,120
Go ahead, ask us.

111
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:06,390
Walton: Dove finds these files,
and it holds all the information

112
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:08,430
about who her parents
were, what her name is.

113
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:12,130
And that's just one story
out of many of the kids.

114
00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:15,480
Eshet: They lied to
all of the children.

115
00:05:15,610 --> 00:05:18,570
And I think that is going
to be their downfall.

116
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:19,790
Let her go.

117
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:21,660
You don't understand.

118
00:05:21,790 --> 00:05:24,620
She's Padre's daughter.
You've been lied to.

119
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:26,556
Chambliss: Ultimately,
in its effort to survive,

120
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:29,110
Padre ended up creating
the very people

121
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:31,060
who are going to end
up bringing it down.

122
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:40,900
Season 8 took us
to a watery world

123
00:05:41,030 --> 00:05:42,550
full of muck and mud

124
00:05:42,690 --> 00:05:45,560
and sinking boats
and swamp walkers.

125
00:05:45,690 --> 00:05:48,340
To do this, the show went
to the wetlands of Georgia,

126
00:05:48,470 --> 00:05:51,480
where they built a
swamp in a swamp.

127
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:03,970
I really like working
in the manmade swamp.

128
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:06,320
It's such an impressive
production design,

129
00:06:06,450 --> 00:06:07,450
the set design.

130
00:06:07,580 --> 00:06:09,100
All the special effects team,

131
00:06:09,230 --> 00:06:11,760
everything they've done,
it's pretty remarkable.

132
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:17,370
Goldberg: The swamp
was a whole new element

133
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:20,680
that we got in season 8
with the move to Savannah.

134
00:06:20,810 --> 00:06:23,770
Well, do the alligators,
and do the snakes,

135
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:26,420
do they all know that
this is a manmade swamp?

136
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:29,600
Goldberg: Our team went
in and excavated an area,

137
00:06:29,730 --> 00:06:33,610
put in our own swamp water
so that we could regulate

138
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:35,666
and we could make sure that
there were no alligators

139
00:06:35,690 --> 00:06:37,440
or anything that
were getting in.

140
00:06:37,570 --> 00:06:39,410
We built this thing to
control the water levels

141
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:42,010
and control the
critters and control...

142
00:06:42,140 --> 00:06:44,660
Just basically have control
over the environment.

143
00:06:46,270 --> 00:06:47,920
Goldberg: We got our
swamp walkers, which

144
00:06:48,050 --> 00:06:53,100
KNB just made them so
nightmarish and cool.

145
00:06:54,670 --> 00:06:56,516
Dickens: The first night
we worked in the swamp,

146
00:06:56,540 --> 00:06:58,800
it was really
moderate temperatures.

147
00:06:58,940 --> 00:07:01,290
And I remember us kind of
looking at each other like,

148
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:03,770
"This is kind of fun, right?"

149
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:09,950
James: Particularly the
man made swamp that we had,

150
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:12,780
the water was constantly
moving and pumped fresh

151
00:07:12,910 --> 00:07:15,040
and all of that.

152
00:07:15,170 --> 00:07:20,780
And it was kind of nice, I'm
saying in inverted commas,

153
00:07:20,910 --> 00:07:23,220
when the weather was warm.

154
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:27,400
When we were doing it
later on in the season

155
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:31,710
and the weather had
turned, not so much.

156
00:07:34,230 --> 00:07:36,190
Dickens: It was a little
bit like a carnival ride

157
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:38,280
to work on it because
you're working at an angle

158
00:07:38,410 --> 00:07:41,850
like this the whole time
and half wet the whole time.

159
00:07:41,980 --> 00:07:43,996
David: Looking at the set with
the houseboat in the water

160
00:07:44,020 --> 00:07:46,680
and Grace coming in on
that raft was so badass.

161
00:07:46,810 --> 00:07:50,550
I mean, I could not have
asked for a better entrance

162
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:51,990
to start off the season.

163
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:53,990
Who are you?

164
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:56,250
I'm your mother.

165
00:07:56,380 --> 00:07:58,300
We've seen a lot
of horrible things

166
00:07:58,430 --> 00:08:00,300
on "Fear The Walking
Dead" over the years,

167
00:08:00,430 --> 00:08:02,430
but Shrike infecting
Finch with a walker bite

168
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:06,260
on the train car is
about as dark as it gets.

169
00:08:06,390 --> 00:08:08,050
No, please!

170
00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:11,220
All in the name of finding
a cure that doesn't work.

171
00:08:19,890 --> 00:08:24,670
Goldberg: The train car was
this off site medical facility

172
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:28,110
where Padre was doing
horrific experiments

173
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:30,550
in the name of this cure.

174
00:08:32,030 --> 00:08:33,680
Hello, Blue Jay.

175
00:08:33,810 --> 00:08:37,030
Eshet: I infect Finch
to give June motivation

176
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:39,510
to continue the research.

177
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:41,496
Elfman: Padre started
these horrible experiments

178
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:44,170
and held June at gunpoint
and made her do them.

179
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:46,520
Why is Padre doing this?

180
00:08:46,650 --> 00:08:48,480
The same reason he
does everything...

181
00:08:48,610 --> 00:08:51,870
To ensure what
he's built endures.

182
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:56,180
I sacrifice one individual
in order to find a vaccine

183
00:08:56,310 --> 00:08:59,190
and maybe solve
this for humanity.

184
00:09:03,230 --> 00:09:05,540
The set looked awesome.

185
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:09,330
Goldberg: We wanted to
create this image of this

186
00:09:09,460 --> 00:09:11,020
house of horrors where
people who've had

187
00:09:11,110 --> 00:09:13,770
these terrible experiments
done to them for walker bites.

188
00:09:18,070 --> 00:09:20,640
But it's all coming
from this place of

189
00:09:20,770 --> 00:09:22,770
wanting to prevent loss,

190
00:09:22,910 --> 00:09:25,340
which is ultimately
something that you can't do.

191
00:09:27,820 --> 00:09:32,130
It was really brutal
to shoot that scene.

192
00:09:34,830 --> 00:09:37,400
It was awful.

193
00:09:37,530 --> 00:09:41,310
Dwight: No, no,
no, no, no, no, no.

194
00:09:41,450 --> 00:09:44,400
We're in this tight train car.

195
00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:47,060
Finch is a few feet
in front of us.

196
00:09:47,190 --> 00:09:49,320
We're tied to this pipe.

197
00:09:49,450 --> 00:09:53,850
To watch Dwight and Sherry's
reaction, as parents,

198
00:09:53,980 --> 00:09:56,720
helplessly watching something
happen to your child

199
00:09:56,850 --> 00:10:02,380
that you can't do anything
about is very emotional.

200
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:06,080
Amelio: It was pretty
dark world, you know?

201
00:10:06,210 --> 00:10:10,910
So it's like you got to go there
in order for it to be truthful.

202
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:15,220
I'm gonna kill you.
I'm gonna kill you!

203
00:10:15,350 --> 00:10:17,390
Elfman: I think we all
went back to the hotel

204
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:19,220
and just, like, sat outside

205
00:10:19,350 --> 00:10:23,050
and, like, had to get some
fresh air after that day.

206
00:10:29,450 --> 00:10:33,150
Sure enough, one by one, our
characters turned on Padre.

207
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:34,410
Where are you taking me?

208
00:10:34,540 --> 00:10:35,696
As far away from
Padre as possible.

209
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:37,980
It started with
Madison, but Padre,

210
00:10:38,110 --> 00:10:39,290
led by Shrike and Crane,

211
00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:41,590
had a real knack
for making enemies.

212
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:44,810
Just ask June or
Morgan, Grace, and Mo.

213
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:45,940
What about everyone else?

214
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:47,080
Or Dwight and Sherry.

215
00:10:47,210 --> 00:10:48,210
I'm gonna kill you.

216
00:10:48,340 --> 00:10:49,950
Or Daniel and his parent army.

217
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:53,690
Padre, you pissed off the
wrong group of people.

218
00:10:56,090 --> 00:10:59,390
Hello? Is anyone in there?

219
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:01,050
Wait, wait.

220
00:11:01,180 --> 00:11:03,530
Please. I'm not
going to hurt you.

221
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:06,880
Dickens: Madison is
really important to Padre

222
00:11:07,010 --> 00:11:11,100
because she's
rebelling against them.

223
00:11:11,230 --> 00:11:14,060
She was being controlled and
brainwashed and led to believe

224
00:11:14,190 --> 00:11:17,410
that she was going to get
access to her children.

225
00:11:17,540 --> 00:11:19,060
You lied to me.

226
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:22,460
She's consumed with guilt
for participating with Padre

227
00:11:22,590 --> 00:11:24,720
and collecting all the children.

228
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:27,120
Her obsession becomes,
"Let me help these kids

229
00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:28,680
reunite with their parents."

230
00:11:28,810 --> 00:11:29,810
What's your name?

231
00:11:29,950 --> 00:11:31,080
Wren.

232
00:11:31,210 --> 00:11:34,080
No, it's not. It's Mo.

233
00:11:34,210 --> 00:11:37,740
When Mo realized maybe
she wasn't being told

234
00:11:37,870 --> 00:11:41,260
everything about how
she came to the island,

235
00:11:41,390 --> 00:11:42,830
things start to change.

236
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:45,350
Change of plans.
We're leaving.

237
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:47,480
Chambliss: When Madison
ends up escaping with Mo,

238
00:11:47,610 --> 00:11:49,570
that is such a dangerous
thing for Padre.

239
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:51,620
If word were to get out,
that would start to show

240
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:53,880
kind of the fissures
in the foundation.

241
00:11:54,010 --> 00:11:55,270
Where are we going?

242
00:11:55,410 --> 00:11:57,230
To find your dad.

243
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:59,020
On a personal level,

244
00:11:59,150 --> 00:12:03,810
the revolution started with
Morgan spending time with Mo.

245
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:08,110
I think he knows he's never
going to let her go again.

246
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:10,940
I think the initial act
of defiance is massive

247
00:12:11,070 --> 00:12:13,470
because he's within
Padre's reach.

248
00:12:14,950 --> 00:12:17,950
What are you doing
here? How'd you find me?

249
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:19,836
Evangelista: Sherry and
Dwight are on their mission

250
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:22,780
to bring him back so they
could save their son.

251
00:12:22,910 --> 00:12:25,700
When they see what
Morgan is going through,

252
00:12:25,830 --> 00:12:28,480
there's a lot of compassion.

253
00:12:28,610 --> 00:12:29,660
Duane?

254
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:32,310
And you sort of see these two

255
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:34,270
parents mirroring each other.

256
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:36,400
Morgan is essentially
going through

257
00:12:36,530 --> 00:12:38,010
the same thing with his son.

258
00:12:39,710 --> 00:12:43,760
Elfman: For June, Padre
is the exact opposite

259
00:12:43,890 --> 00:12:46,590
of everything June stands for.

260
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:49,940
Her whole purpose is to help,
and once she left Padre,

261
00:12:50,070 --> 00:12:52,550
the only way she
could still help

262
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:56,160
is by somehow disabling
the collectors.

263
00:12:57,290 --> 00:13:00,510
And she did that by cutting
off their trigger fingers.

264
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:06,780
Padre has survived for so
long because it was mostly

265
00:13:06,910 --> 00:13:09,000
young people that
were being controlled.

266
00:13:09,130 --> 00:13:13,180
Elfman: There's been no forces
for good that are strong enough

267
00:13:13,310 --> 00:13:14,880
to overtake Padre.

268
00:13:15,010 --> 00:13:16,440
And we're all separated.

269
00:13:16,570 --> 00:13:17,880
Woman: Hands up!

270
00:13:18,010 --> 00:13:20,580
Blades: The army that
Daniel has trained,

271
00:13:20,710 --> 00:13:24,580
this army of parents, it
has proven pretty effective.

272
00:13:24,710 --> 00:13:26,320
Padre has lied to all of us.

273
00:13:26,450 --> 00:13:28,930
Maybe we can find out
what else he's lied about.

274
00:13:29,060 --> 00:13:30,630
Together.

275
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:32,020
We'll let the commander decide.

276
00:13:32,150 --> 00:13:33,160
Who's the commander?

277
00:13:33,290 --> 00:13:34,980
Daniel: Turn around.

278
00:13:35,110 --> 00:13:36,950
What Daniel has done is
to give them a purpose,

279
00:13:37,070 --> 00:13:39,990
an organization,
and a leadership.

280
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:42,030
Madison?

281
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:43,340
Daniel?

282
00:13:43,470 --> 00:13:44,730
You know these people?

283
00:13:44,860 --> 00:13:46,600
Give them back their weapons.

284
00:13:46,730 --> 00:13:49,610
Blades: Daniel's family is gone,
but now he's going to try to get

285
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:51,870
these people their
families back.

286
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,830
And Padre is a place where
he can make that possible.

287
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:58,660
Daniel: All these people
lost their children to Padre.

288
00:13:58,790 --> 00:14:01,970
And there are more of them.
Maybe your own parents.

289
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:03,530
Madison.

290
00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:05,270
We'll hold them off. Go.

291
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:08,890
When Madison and June
and Dove storm into Padre

292
00:14:09,020 --> 00:14:13,980
to have him show himself,
Madison smashes the mirror.

293
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:22,250
We discover that it's a
very young man in there,

294
00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:23,420
Shrike's brother.

295
00:14:23,550 --> 00:14:24,770
Eshet: The secret revealed,

296
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:28,120
is a huge danger for
the entire operation.

297
00:14:28,250 --> 00:14:30,780
What they're risking is that all
of the members of the community

298
00:14:30,910 --> 00:14:32,390
are going to turn against them,

299
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:34,300
and then everything
could collapse.

300
00:14:34,430 --> 00:14:37,920
Do you know the
truth about Padre?

301
00:14:38,050 --> 00:14:41,480
There is no Padre. He's
been dead for a long time.

302
00:14:41,610 --> 00:14:45,840
Given the fact that Padre was
all built on just a series of

303
00:14:45,970 --> 00:14:48,230
lies, a series of playing
people off each other...

304
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:50,190
Guns up!

305
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:52,166
And because Shrike and
Crane were trying to prevent

306
00:14:52,190 --> 00:14:54,710
anyone else from feeling
any kind of loss,

307
00:14:54,850 --> 00:14:58,280
that kind of absolute I think
is just what ultimately made it

308
00:14:58,410 --> 00:15:00,630
inevitable that it would fall.

309
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:07,210
You were just given an order!

310
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:09,470
Fire.

311
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:11,950
They won't do it.

312
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:14,690
I think ultimately people
do need connection.

313
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:19,170
People need family and
to build a community.

314
00:15:21,050 --> 00:15:23,920
Goldberg: More and more people
start to kind of tear down this

315
00:15:24,050 --> 00:15:27,880
wall of what Padre has built
and what was behind it.

316
00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:31,100
And even though it hurts
more to connect with people

317
00:15:31,230 --> 00:15:33,190
that you might lose,
it's still better

318
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:36,670
than walling yourself
off from that connection.

319
00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:42,110
Morgan didn't just
fight Padre this season.

320
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:45,030
He fought some serious
inner demons, as well.

321
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:48,120
There was no telling when he
went into his red fugue state

322
00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:51,990
whether he might kill anyone
and anything around him.

323
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:53,770
No!

324
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:56,250
Lennie James talks about
how and why this happened,

325
00:15:56,390 --> 00:15:59,130
and cast and crew take us
through how they created

326
00:15:59,260 --> 00:16:02,480
the action on a sinking
houseboat full of walkers

327
00:16:02,610 --> 00:16:04,960
with Morgan seeing red.

328
00:16:12,270 --> 00:16:14,190
Morgan: I can't!

329
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:18,320
This is Morgan's version
of post traumatic stress.

330
00:16:18,450 --> 00:16:19,580
Easy! Madison!

331
00:16:19,710 --> 00:16:21,760
Easy there. What happened?

332
00:16:21,890 --> 00:16:25,020
He doesn't remember when
he's in the red state.

333
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:28,160
The audience actually
get a vision of Morgan

334
00:16:28,290 --> 00:16:29,550
that he never sees.

335
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:32,160
My ax! Where is my ax?!

336
00:16:32,290 --> 00:16:35,380
He's trying to document
this version of himself.

337
00:16:35,510 --> 00:16:38,300
He's trying to write
down "Morgan was here,"

338
00:16:38,430 --> 00:16:43,260
and it just comes out in
broken, disjointed graffiti.

339
00:16:44,350 --> 00:16:47,520
The reason why this
has all woken up in him

340
00:16:47,650 --> 00:16:52,310
is because Morgan has taken
on the responsibility of Mo.

341
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:54,050
What does clear mean?

342
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:59,140
Clear? It's when I was
killing anything and anyone.

343
00:16:59,270 --> 00:17:01,190
If I can't look after her now,

344
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:03,670
I might not be able to
do it in the future.

345
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:05,720
I might not be able to
keep this child alive.

346
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:07,370
Dad, help me!

347
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:08,980
That is what blacks him out.

348
00:17:09,110 --> 00:17:12,370
That is what sends
him into the red.

349
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:17,770
Before the take, I'd
try and hold my breath

350
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:19,340
for as long as it's
humanly possible.

351
00:17:19,420 --> 00:17:21,690
It's like he's coming out
from being underwater.

352
00:17:21,820 --> 00:17:24,300
And he just needs to
get to the surface.

353
00:17:24,430 --> 00:17:28,390
And when he gets out of it,
he's gasping that air in.

354
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:30,220
Woman: Morgan!

355
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,090
James: We kept reminding
everybody who was around Morgan

356
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:38,010
in those episodes that
what they had seen

357
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:40,230
was someone to be frightened of.

358
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:41,970
Did I hurt you?

359
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:43,670
Managed to stay out of your way.

360
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:46,580
There's a reason why Morgan
has lasted this long.

361
00:17:46,710 --> 00:17:48,060
When he's in the fugue state,

362
00:17:48,190 --> 00:17:51,240
he is capable of
serious destruction.

363
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:55,110
McLean: We worked
with the show runner

364
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:58,680
to develop a very interesting
effect for the Red Fugue states.

365
00:17:58,810 --> 00:18:00,550
We wanted a texture to it.

366
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:03,640
Some of the things I used was
like melting paint inside of oil

367
00:18:03,770 --> 00:18:05,510
so that it swirled.

368
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:08,130
And then we had to figure out
what is the best type of shot.

369
00:18:08,260 --> 00:18:10,130
You want it to be close
on his face so that

370
00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:11,936
he can shift, and the
background, just shoom.

371
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:13,870
And then speed.

372
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,050
A lot of it has
to do with timing.

373
00:18:16,180 --> 00:18:17,920
One of the last
pieces was an overlay.

374
00:18:18,050 --> 00:18:21,050
What is something that
floats on top of the screen?

375
00:18:21,180 --> 00:18:23,310
We sourced medical
images of eyeballs,

376
00:18:23,450 --> 00:18:27,100
so he's kind of in his
mind's eye, literally.

377
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:33,850
I think it's going to
be a really cool effect.

378
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:36,630
Sorry!

379
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:38,940
You started killing,
and then it was like

380
00:18:39,070 --> 00:18:40,086
you thought I was one of them.

381
00:18:40,110 --> 00:18:41,200
It's okay.

382
00:18:41,330 --> 00:18:44,340
Man: Ready. Three,
two, one. Action.

383
00:18:44,470 --> 00:18:48,080
Today, the scenes that I'm
shooting are where Morgan and Mo

384
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:50,690
are stuck in the houseboat
fighting the walkers

385
00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:53,080
while the water is rising.

386
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:59,000
It does feel like I
am in a sinking boat

387
00:18:59,130 --> 00:19:01,740
because it happened so quickly.

388
00:19:01,870 --> 00:19:04,066
Armstrong: There's a progression
in terms of the sinking.

389
00:19:04,090 --> 00:19:06,310
We started on two different
set pieces we had.

390
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:09,100
One was on airbags
that we could control

391
00:19:09,230 --> 00:19:12,360
a small, slight
descent into the swamp,

392
00:19:12,490 --> 00:19:16,850
and then we transitioned
to our full dunk tank.

393
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:20,200
Iudica: And we have
a 120-ton crane

394
00:19:20,330 --> 00:19:23,330
to gently lower this
set piece underwater.

395
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:25,250
When we sink the boat,
we'll sink it level,

396
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:27,810
but it'll look like
it's at an angle.

397
00:19:27,940 --> 00:19:29,990
Platform weighs
about 15,000 pounds,

398
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:34,430
so it gives us room for about
20 or so people on board.

399
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:37,910
We control the speed, we control
the stops and the starts.

400
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:41,220
There's always a safe exit.

401
00:19:41,350 --> 00:19:44,440
We have water pumps that
will create a lot of wake

402
00:19:44,570 --> 00:19:47,960
and agitation so you can get
water on the surface to ripple

403
00:19:48,090 --> 00:19:50,310
towards them or you can
bounce water off the wall,

404
00:19:50,450 --> 00:19:53,400
and then also compressed
air to add bubbles

405
00:19:53,540 --> 00:19:58,150
as if all of the air pockets
in the boat are releasing.

406
00:20:01,850 --> 00:20:03,410
Mo, give me my ax!

407
00:20:03,550 --> 00:20:06,030
McLean: When we're in the
swamps, VFX is here to help

408
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:08,250
make things that are
safe seem dangerous.

409
00:20:08,380 --> 00:20:11,070
So any time there's a
safety wire or a rig

410
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:14,560
or if there's hoses to keep the
water level in the right place,

411
00:20:14,690 --> 00:20:17,730
if we see that in the shot,
we can paint that out later.

412
00:20:19,300 --> 00:20:21,300
Come on. I can help you.

413
00:20:21,430 --> 00:20:22,740
I've got it.

414
00:20:22,870 --> 00:20:24,196
You know, we have
zombies stuck in the mud.

415
00:20:24,220 --> 00:20:25,586
We have people fighting
on the houseboat.

416
00:20:25,610 --> 00:20:27,610
The houseboat is sinking.
It's a wild scene.

417
00:20:31,180 --> 00:20:32,816
McLean: We make it super
controlled and super safe

418
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:34,766
on set, and with a little
help from our stunt department

419
00:20:34,790 --> 00:20:35,870
and a little help from VFX,

420
00:20:35,970 --> 00:20:37,450
we make it look
really dangerous.

421
00:20:39,150 --> 00:20:40,970
Morgan: You're gonna
make it out of here, Mo.

422
00:20:42,850 --> 00:20:45,330
A big part of Morgan's story
this season was his need

423
00:20:45,460 --> 00:20:46,890
to deal with his trauma.

424
00:20:47,020 --> 00:20:49,030
That's why he returned to
his home in King County

425
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:52,810
to put his wife Jenny and son
Duane to rest after so long.

426
00:20:52,940 --> 00:20:54,860
Sorry it took me so long.

427
00:20:54,990 --> 00:20:56,550
Wolfe: Over 10 years later,

428
00:20:56,690 --> 00:20:59,120
this iconic place we know
from "The Walking Dead" pilot

429
00:20:59,250 --> 00:21:02,080
was recreated thanks to
show runners Ian Goldberg

430
00:21:02,210 --> 00:21:05,690
and Andrew Chambliss, along
with the design and FX teams.

431
00:21:05,820 --> 00:21:07,830
It was a powerful
journey for Morgan,

432
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:11,270
and it ends in devastation
when his moment of peace

433
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:14,010
is shattered by
Grace getting bitten.

434
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:22,620
Man: We just add
a puff of smoke.

435
00:21:22,750 --> 00:21:24,890
Two cameras.

436
00:21:25,020 --> 00:21:27,930
We knew as soon as we started
talking about season 8

437
00:21:28,060 --> 00:21:32,330
that this was going to be a
crucial episode for Morgan,

438
00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:35,510
and his journey, was taking
him back to King County,

439
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:38,470
which is where his journey
began as a character,

440
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:41,250
way back on the pilot
of "The Walking Dead."

441
00:21:41,380 --> 00:21:42,510
He say something?

442
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:44,120
Thought I heard
him say something.

443
00:21:44,250 --> 00:21:46,340
He called me Carl. Son,
you know they don't talk.

444
00:21:46,470 --> 00:21:49,260
But it was kind of a tall
order. To say to ourselves like,

445
00:21:49,390 --> 00:21:51,830
"Okay, if we're going to
go back to this location,

446
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:56,140
these sets, where the entire
kind of Walking Dead universe

447
00:21:56,270 --> 00:21:58,270
began, you know, we
had to have a story

448
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,790
that really justified it.

449
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:02,660
Over here. Come on.

450
00:22:02,790 --> 00:22:07,840
And I have to give just huge,
huge props to our entire team

451
00:22:07,970 --> 00:22:11,330
and our production designer,
Russell and his team,

452
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:14,940
who rebuilt the house
with painstaking detail

453
00:22:15,070 --> 00:22:17,510
to match exactly what was there,

454
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:19,640
which was no easy feat,
considering the last time

455
00:22:19,770 --> 00:22:22,470
we saw that house was
over 10 years ago,

456
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:25,250
and it felt like
stepping into the past.

457
00:22:25,380 --> 00:22:26,510
Daddy.

458
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:27,780
Bless him.

459
00:22:27,910 --> 00:22:29,430
The work that they
did on their own

460
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:31,870
recreating that
place was fantastic.

461
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,846
Jaeger: Obviously, we had to do
a tremendous amount of research

462
00:22:33,870 --> 00:22:36,960
to create what is
just an iconic space

463
00:22:37,090 --> 00:22:39,790
and then take that space
to its ultimate demise

464
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:43,880
of destroying this iconic
piece of Walking Dead history.

465
00:22:44,010 --> 00:22:46,360
Mo: Dad, I'm upstairs.
I can't get out.

466
00:22:46,490 --> 00:22:49,360
Get to the attic, Mo.
I'm on my way to you.

467
00:22:49,930 --> 00:22:52,890
When my agent sent
me the e-mail,

468
00:22:53,020 --> 00:22:55,410
I literally asked
him, was he serious?

469
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:57,850
And then I said, "Well, I
guess you are."

470
00:22:57,980 --> 00:22:59,900
And then I said yes.

471
00:23:02,420 --> 00:23:04,810
It was so exciting
to bring Jenny back.

472
00:23:04,940 --> 00:23:07,600
And the image of
Jenny as a walker

473
00:23:07,730 --> 00:23:09,600
standing outside that house,

474
00:23:09,730 --> 00:23:13,130
it's just so kind of rooted
in The Walking Dead's history.

475
00:23:13,260 --> 00:23:16,390
It was like we were right back
in "The Walking Dead" pilot.

476
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:19,570
It was great to see her, and
I think it's a real testament

477
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:22,530
to this particular universe
that such things can happen.

478
00:23:27,010 --> 00:23:28,580
I'm on my way!

479
00:23:28,710 --> 00:23:30,726
Chambliss: Through a combination
of some makeup effects

480
00:23:30,750 --> 00:23:33,800
and then some visual effects,
we were able to recreate

481
00:23:33,930 --> 00:23:35,330
walker Duane in
those final moments,

482
00:23:35,450 --> 00:23:37,800
when we finally saw
him up in that attic.

483
00:23:37,930 --> 00:23:39,150
Seeing the walker...

484
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:40,280
Please!

485
00:23:40,410 --> 00:23:43,940
Duane as alive Duane,

486
00:23:44,070 --> 00:23:46,290
it's about that battle that...

487
00:23:46,420 --> 00:23:47,900
Help!...Morgan's
having with himself.

488
00:23:48,030 --> 00:23:50,120
Daddy! Daddy.

489
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:58,650
McLean: They tore down
the house that was built

490
00:23:58,780 --> 00:24:00,870
and then made it look like
it had been burnt down.

491
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,310
And it's super weird to see
something that you were just

492
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:05,830
here for the night before
be completely transformed

493
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:09,310
into something different
for the next scene.

494
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:11,310
David: It's a home
full of memories,

495
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:13,970
a home full of history,
a home full of love,

496
00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:16,670
a home full of heartache.

497
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:21,410
And to see that all be
obliterated so quickly,

498
00:24:21,540 --> 00:24:24,280
like even me as Karen, I
was just watching this.

499
00:24:24,410 --> 00:24:27,160
I was so heartbroken
in that moment.

500
00:24:28,550 --> 00:24:31,420
James: When he buries
Duane and Jenny,

501
00:24:31,550 --> 00:24:34,600
I think he thinks he's at peace.

502
00:24:34,730 --> 00:24:37,040
We do what we said
we were gonna.

503
00:24:37,170 --> 00:24:40,130
Spend as much time
together as we can.

504
00:24:41,430 --> 00:24:43,650
Goldberg: I think Morgan
does have a moment of peace

505
00:24:43,780 --> 00:24:46,000
when he's burying
Jenny and Duane.

506
00:24:46,130 --> 00:24:49,740
And the tragic part of it is
that just as that happens...

507
00:24:49,870 --> 00:24:52,050
Dad!

508
00:24:52,180 --> 00:24:53,790
Grace gets bit.

509
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:55,450
Come on.

510
00:24:55,580 --> 00:24:57,620
Morgan's love story
was one of the things

511
00:24:57,750 --> 00:25:00,490
that was hardest
for us to achieve,

512
00:25:00,620 --> 00:25:03,450
and I don't think we
could have done that

513
00:25:03,580 --> 00:25:06,760
without an actress of
Karen's caliber, really.

514
00:25:06,890 --> 00:25:09,590
Man: And cut.

515
00:25:10,070 --> 00:25:13,510
Kenneth Requa did such a
beautiful job directing it.

516
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:16,210
We're really happy
with how it turned out.

517
00:25:17,730 --> 00:25:20,120
And cut. Great. Let's move on.

518
00:25:21,650 --> 00:25:24,690
Not so easy to move on
from an episode like this.

519
00:25:24,820 --> 00:25:28,910
And seeing that walker
bite on Grace, it hurts.

520
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:32,180
The end of the first
half of this final season

521
00:25:32,310 --> 00:25:35,700
sadly takes us to the end of
our time with Grace and Morgan

522
00:25:35,830 --> 00:25:38,580
and with Karen David
and Lennie James,

523
00:25:38,710 --> 00:25:40,710
who talk about the
Grace/Morgan love story,

524
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:43,540
saying goodbye to these
powerful characters,

525
00:25:43,670 --> 00:25:46,190
and what the show
has meant to them.

526
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:47,930
We also hear from
their fellow cast

527
00:25:48,060 --> 00:25:51,720
and the show runners as they
pay tribute to this beloved duo.

528
00:26:01,900 --> 00:26:04,950
James: When Morgan
walked in on "Fear",

529
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:06,730
he had holes in his shoes,

530
00:26:06,860 --> 00:26:10,300
his boots were held together
by tape, he was alone,

531
00:26:10,430 --> 00:26:13,130
he was friendless, frightened.

532
00:26:13,260 --> 00:26:14,960
He wanted to avoid people.

533
00:26:15,090 --> 00:26:16,456
Man: Are you sure
you're going to be

534
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:17,586
all right out there on your own?

535
00:26:17,610 --> 00:26:20,920
This world, we're always alone.

536
00:26:22,710 --> 00:26:27,670
Grace: Take off your
clothes. All of them.

537
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:30,890
Grace is such a vital character
toward Morgan's journey.

538
00:26:31,020 --> 00:26:33,760
I've always been a
kind of serious guy.

539
00:26:33,890 --> 00:26:35,460
Really?

540
00:26:35,590 --> 00:26:37,696
The journey that this love
story has to go on has to go on

541
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:39,240
the fact that this is a man

542
00:26:39,380 --> 00:26:42,470
who is not in any way
aware of the possibility

543
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:44,550
of loving anybody apart
from his dead wife.

544
00:26:44,690 --> 00:26:47,780
So this has to take
him by surprise.

545
00:26:47,910 --> 00:26:49,340
And that's a hell
of a job to do.

546
00:26:49,470 --> 00:26:51,740
And Karen did it.

547
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:56,440
David: When Morgan lay,
Duane and Jenny to rest,

548
00:26:56,570 --> 00:26:59,480
there was this sense
of finality, closure,

549
00:26:59,610 --> 00:27:01,350
this beautiful sense of peace.

550
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:04,710
It was sort of a 1-2 punch
of wanting to feel like right

551
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:08,930
at that moment of maximum hope,

552
00:27:09,060 --> 00:27:12,450
a walker punches
through a rubble.

553
00:27:12,580 --> 00:27:14,340
David: What a parent
will do for their child,

554
00:27:14,370 --> 00:27:15,516
they will die for their child.

555
00:27:15,540 --> 00:27:17,670
And she saw her
daughter in danger,

556
00:27:17,810 --> 00:27:20,630
and she just acted like
any parent would have.

557
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:22,420
It's just heartbreaking
in that moment

558
00:27:22,550 --> 00:27:24,120
because whatever
happiness and lightness

559
00:27:24,250 --> 00:27:26,810
that this family, you know,
the three of them could have,

560
00:27:26,940 --> 00:27:29,430
you want that so much for them,
and that's now been robbed.

561
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:30,840
Grace, I don't
think I'm going to

562
00:27:30,910 --> 00:27:32,520
make it to you before...

563
00:27:32,650 --> 00:27:34,780
I tell you, filming my
last moments with Lenny

564
00:27:34,910 --> 00:27:36,040
was really tough.

565
00:27:36,170 --> 00:27:37,830
I'm so sorry, Morgan.

566
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:40,610
David: Being on the walkie
and doing that scene

567
00:27:40,740 --> 00:27:42,920
was just so incredibly
heartbreaking.

568
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:45,830
David: When Grace is a walker,

569
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:48,270
it was hard to watch
even on the playback.

570
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:51,450
There's so much love in how

571
00:27:51,580 --> 00:27:54,930
Morgan just gently
laid her down.

572
00:27:55,060 --> 00:27:57,670
When we lose characters on
this show or characters die,

573
00:27:57,800 --> 00:27:59,190
we want it to mean something,

574
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:01,760
we want it to leave
an emotional ripple.

575
00:28:01,890 --> 00:28:04,070
And Karen definitely did that.

576
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:06,810
James: The way we finished
with Grace is a real testament

577
00:28:06,940 --> 00:28:09,200
to the job that
Karen's done, really.

578
00:28:09,330 --> 00:28:10,510
It's supposed to hurt.

579
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:12,120
It's supposed to
break your heart.

580
00:28:12,250 --> 00:28:14,080
You're supposed to be angry.

581
00:28:14,210 --> 00:28:18,260
All of those things come into
play because we're losing Karen.

582
00:28:18,390 --> 00:28:22,390
She is like a bright
light. She's just sunshine.

583
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:24,310
I'm proud to have
worked with her.

584
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:27,960
I feel blessed that we
had this journey together.

585
00:28:29,620 --> 00:28:31,970
Both women, both
Grace and Karen,

586
00:28:32,100 --> 00:28:38,280
are just these lovely sort
of self-sacrificial women.

587
00:28:38,410 --> 00:28:39,710
It's always hard to say goodbye.

588
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:43,590
Saying goodbye to
Karen David is not easy

589
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:45,280
because she's truly
one of the loveliest

590
00:28:45,410 --> 00:28:47,290
human beings to work with.

591
00:28:47,420 --> 00:28:50,380
When I think of her, I think
of her as a bouquet of flowers.

592
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:59,170
David: The family that
we've created with our crew,

593
00:28:59,300 --> 00:29:01,080
our creatives, our cast,

594
00:29:01,210 --> 00:29:03,690
the beautiful thing about
this whole experience

595
00:29:03,820 --> 00:29:08,350
of being part of this universe
is that you take the people

596
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:13,400
in your hearts and you take them
on your journey wherever you go.

597
00:29:13,530 --> 00:29:15,920
They are a part of who I am now.

598
00:29:18,100 --> 00:29:22,190
Morgan: The way out is
opening the door to people,

599
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:26,150
to possibility, to the
hurt that will happen.

600
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:28,410
I've found the way,
and I opened the door,

601
00:29:28,540 --> 00:29:30,980
and then my life
started all over again.

602
00:29:31,110 --> 00:29:33,070
Chambliss: Lenny has
been such a fixture

603
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:35,120
since Ian and I
started in season 4,

604
00:29:35,250 --> 00:29:38,250
and he's been such a fixture
of The Walking Dead universe

605
00:29:38,380 --> 00:29:42,990
that it's really hard to imagine
making this show without him.

606
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:45,780
I'm a bit in denial that
Lenny's gone, to be honest.

607
00:29:45,910 --> 00:29:48,040
He's been such a vital
part of the journey.

608
00:29:48,170 --> 00:29:51,520
I think he's an inspiration.
Truly, he's one of a kind.

609
00:29:51,650 --> 00:29:55,660
We'll be forever grateful to
Lenny for his time with us.

610
00:29:55,790 --> 00:29:59,100
Lenny has been such a
tremendous part of it

611
00:29:59,230 --> 00:30:00,400
once he joined the show.

612
00:30:00,530 --> 00:30:01,970
It's been great to
play adversaries.

613
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:03,840
I truly hope that
I get the chance

614
00:30:03,970 --> 00:30:06,800
to create with him other
characters in the future.

615
00:30:06,930 --> 00:30:09,060
But for now, I know I have
a brother and a friend.

616
00:30:09,190 --> 00:30:12,200
Dickens: Lenny James could
not have been more open to me

617
00:30:12,330 --> 00:30:15,680
and gracious in
welcoming me back.

618
00:30:15,810 --> 00:30:18,250
He's been an incredible
inspiration to watch

619
00:30:18,380 --> 00:30:21,820
and to work with, and
he lives in our hearts.

620
00:30:21,950 --> 00:30:24,640
Elfman: I really look up
to Lenny James as an actor.

621
00:30:24,770 --> 00:30:28,340
Every chapter of Morgan
has that essence to him,

622
00:30:28,470 --> 00:30:32,430
just that benevolent heart
that he gets to walk away with.

623
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:34,960
Mo, I think, is super beautiful.

624
00:30:35,090 --> 00:30:38,270
To recognize for himself
that he has found love,

625
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:41,140
that he's capable of love, that
he's capable of giving again.

626
00:30:41,270 --> 00:30:44,530
And so he leaves
with the cup so full.

627
00:30:46,010 --> 00:30:49,020
James: When Morgan
walks away from "Fear",

628
00:30:49,150 --> 00:30:51,890
he has a child, he
has made friends,

629
00:30:52,020 --> 00:30:55,070
he's lost friends, and
he's had an effect on them.

630
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:58,680
And he leaves them better
than he found them.

631
00:30:58,810 --> 00:31:02,030
You can't really ask
for much more than that.

632
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:05,420
Morgan: This message
is for Rick Grimes.

633
00:31:05,550 --> 00:31:07,820
It's Morgan Jones.

634
00:31:07,950 --> 00:31:10,300
Man, I'm going to
come and look for you.

635
00:31:10,430 --> 00:31:15,220
Who knows? Maybe you
might even be listening.

636
00:31:27,620 --> 00:31:29,400
Goodbyes are never easy,

637
00:31:29,530 --> 00:31:32,320
and neither is finding
love in the apocalypse.

638
00:31:32,450 --> 00:31:33,630
But Grace and Morgan did it.

639
00:31:35,190 --> 00:31:37,720
AMC has partnered
with the organization

640
00:31:37,850 --> 00:31:39,680
See Her to celebrate
the women of

641
00:31:39,810 --> 00:31:40,980
"Fear The Walking Dead."

642
00:31:41,110 --> 00:31:42,330
I'm not gonna hurt you.

643
00:31:42,460 --> 00:31:44,070
We put that spotlight
on Kim Dickens,

644
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:46,510
who talked about her
portrayal of Madison Clark

645
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:48,640
and her fight against Padre.

646
00:31:48,770 --> 00:31:49,876
Mo ended up at
Padre because of me.

647
00:31:49,900 --> 00:31:51,250
Let me try to make this right.

648
00:31:51,380 --> 00:31:52,980
With a formidable
performance like Kim's,

649
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:56,690
it's no wonder Padre was
so scared of Madison.

650
00:32:00,870 --> 00:32:03,310
Padre: Do you really
want to do this?

651
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:04,920
There's nothing
you could do to me

652
00:32:05,050 --> 00:32:06,750
that's worse than what
I'm already living.

653
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:08,026
Dickens: Madison has
said it over and over.

654
00:32:08,050 --> 00:32:09,750
She's got nothing left to lose.

655
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:13,360
Once she's able to break free
from Padre's imprisonment

656
00:32:13,490 --> 00:32:15,320
and starts the rescue mission,

657
00:32:15,450 --> 00:32:18,240
that's the only thing that
gives Madison a will to live,

658
00:32:18,370 --> 00:32:20,500
is to make up for
the wrongs she's done

659
00:32:20,630 --> 00:32:23,240
by reuniting these families.

660
00:32:23,370 --> 00:32:24,630
Seriously?

661
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:27,110
Coming back to the show
was very interesting

662
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:30,330
because I'd never
worked with Lenny.

663
00:32:30,470 --> 00:32:33,950
I'd never worked
with Morgan Jones.

664
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:36,080
Back on that beach,
I said I was going

665
00:32:36,210 --> 00:32:37,340
to save your daughter.

666
00:32:37,470 --> 00:32:38,870
I also said I was
going to save you.

667
00:32:38,910 --> 00:32:40,056
I guess that's what I'm
going to have to do.

668
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:41,130
We don't need saved.

669
00:32:41,260 --> 00:32:44,170
Those two unlikely
travel partners,

670
00:32:44,310 --> 00:32:47,610
Morgan and Madison, or as
I like to call them, M&M,

671
00:32:47,740 --> 00:32:52,700
they have an amazing knowledge
and insight into each other.

672
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:54,920
Go. I'll draw them away.

673
00:32:55,060 --> 00:32:56,620
We fell right into
step with each other.

674
00:32:56,750 --> 00:32:59,190
I spent seven years in a cell
so you could be with her.

675
00:32:59,320 --> 00:33:02,370
This isn't about you.
I'm doing this for her.

676
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:04,110
I got to fight him.

677
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:05,850
We were fighting
like our day one

678
00:33:05,980 --> 00:33:07,330
of getting to know each other.

679
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:12,290
I think she spots very early
on that Morgan needs to do

680
00:33:12,420 --> 00:33:13,900
what Morgan needs to do.

681
00:33:14,030 --> 00:33:15,770
It's happening again.

682
00:33:15,900 --> 00:33:18,730
Dickens: As far as Madison's arc
goes, I think you finally see

683
00:33:18,860 --> 00:33:20,560
a glimmer of the old Madison,

684
00:33:20,690 --> 00:33:24,350
the warrior and the person who's
going to make things right.

685
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:27,090
And for me, I thought
that was astounding.

686
00:33:27,220 --> 00:33:29,390
Goldberg: Kim Dickens
is such a force.

687
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:33,440
That role is such an
iconic role in not just

688
00:33:33,570 --> 00:33:36,310
"Fear The Walking Dead," but
in the Walking Dead universe.

689
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:38,970
And this season, Madison
realizes that she's got

690
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:40,320
a decision to make.

691
00:33:40,450 --> 00:33:41,880
Who is she going to be,

692
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:44,450
and how is she going to
protect the settlement?

693
00:33:48,110 --> 00:33:51,070
So with Morgan passing the
leadership torch to Madison

694
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:54,420
and Padre's leaders going down,
there are some big questions

695
00:33:54,550 --> 00:33:56,860
to be answered before
the series concludes.

696
00:33:56,990 --> 00:33:59,340
Can Madison make Padre
into something good?

697
00:33:59,470 --> 00:34:01,430
Will Dwight and Sherry
be able to help?

698
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:04,080
Will they even be
around? Will June?

699
00:34:04,210 --> 00:34:06,000
And of course, there
are a bunch of folks

700
00:34:06,130 --> 00:34:07,520
we haven't seen in a while.

701
00:34:07,650 --> 00:34:10,170
Like, say, Victor Strand.

702
00:34:21,010 --> 00:34:23,190
Now, why was he
calling you Anton?

703
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:26,230
It's such a gigantic task
to think about bringing

704
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:28,970
all these stories, all
these character journeys,

705
00:34:29,110 --> 00:34:30,410
not just to a conclusion,

706
00:34:30,540 --> 00:34:32,590
but also kind of bringing
them full circle.

707
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:33,810
Come here.

708
00:34:33,940 --> 00:34:35,890
When we started to think about

709
00:34:36,030 --> 00:34:37,750
where do we want these
characters to end up,

710
00:34:37,810 --> 00:34:40,860
it actually led to the question
of, well, where did they start?

711
00:34:44,420 --> 00:34:46,860
Chambliss: We wanted to look
back at these characters

712
00:34:46,990 --> 00:34:48,950
from their very
beginnings on the show

713
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:53,870
and look at who they were back
then and who they were now,

714
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:57,350
and we could see how
far they've come.

715
00:34:57,480 --> 00:35:00,050
Goldberg: With each of the
characters, to a certain degree,

716
00:35:00,180 --> 00:35:01,960
in the back half of this season,

717
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:04,490
they have to look back
in order to look forward.

718
00:35:04,620 --> 00:35:07,270
I drew that when we
were both living here.

719
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:09,930
And the theme that kept
coming to the front

720
00:35:10,060 --> 00:35:13,670
of our minds was just
this idea of family.

721
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:18,630
If I just did it differently,
they both might be here.

722
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:20,500
And it all started
with Madison Clark.

723
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:24,420
She was this matriarch at the
beginning of the apocalypse

724
00:35:24,550 --> 00:35:27,380
who always wanted
to protect her kids,

725
00:35:27,510 --> 00:35:29,690
who wanted to create a world
where they could be safe,

726
00:35:29,820 --> 00:35:31,300
who wanted to give
them something that

727
00:35:31,430 --> 00:35:33,130
really didn't exist anymore.

728
00:35:33,260 --> 00:35:34,340
You missed breakfast.

729
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:35,760
The kid needs a
place of her own.

730
00:35:35,870 --> 00:35:37,146
I was thinking about
putting the bed over here.

731
00:35:37,170 --> 00:35:39,480
It all kind of boils
down to the story

732
00:35:39,610 --> 00:35:41,530
and the story you want to tell,

733
00:35:41,660 --> 00:35:45,490
the story that we think will
bring together all the themes,

734
00:35:45,620 --> 00:35:48,230
all the characters,
everyone's stories in a way

735
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:50,530
that will feel satisfying

736
00:35:50,670 --> 00:35:54,150
and also feel like it has
some real finality to it.

737
00:35:57,800 --> 00:35:59,670
I'm going to help you.

738
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:01,590
You're going to help me.

739
00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:03,630
Help you do what?

740
00:36:04,980 --> 00:36:06,770
Save Padre.

741
00:36:07,770 --> 00:36:09,860
I can't wait to see
how it all turns out

742
00:36:09,990 --> 00:36:12,210
in the final episodes.

743
00:36:12,340 --> 00:36:14,120
And for fans of The
Walking Dead universe,

744
00:36:14,250 --> 00:36:17,340
there is so much to
look forward to on AMC.

745
00:36:17,470 --> 00:36:19,690
We're going to make Padre
what it was meant to be

746
00:36:19,820 --> 00:36:21,040
in the first place.

747
00:36:21,170 --> 00:36:22,530
Thanks for watching
"Show Me More",

748
00:36:22,610 --> 00:36:24,570
and thanks for watching
"Fear The Walking Dead."

749
00:36:24,700 --> 00:36:27,790
Remember, you can catch episodes
of "Fear The Walking Dead"

750
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:31,920
on AMC Plus, the AMC site
and apps, and on demand.

751
00:36:32,050 --> 00:36:34,880
Until next time,
I'm Clark Wolfe.
