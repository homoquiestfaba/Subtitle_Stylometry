1
00:01:09,402 --> 00:01:12,002
Come on!

2
00:01:35,795 --> 00:01:37,362
Come on, bastards.

3
00:01:37,363 --> 00:01:39,131
It's time to bet.
That's what you came for.

4
00:01:39,132 --> 00:01:42,267
Come on! Come on!

5
00:01:42,268 --> 00:01:46,268
Come on, move, buddy!

6
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:51,360
Come on, Jimmy!

7
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:58,300
Get up! Get up!

8
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:04,840
Fast! Fast! Fast! Move!

9
00:04:07,814 --> 00:04:11,814
I screwed you, asshole!

10
00:04:34,574 --> 00:04:38,574
Give me my share.

11
00:04:38,678 --> 00:04:42,678
Go wash your face instead.
You look terrible.

12
00:04:52,558 --> 00:04:56,558
THE KID

13
00:05:18,651 --> 00:05:22,651
DO NOT ENTER

14
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:44,609
Get out of my gym.
We're not into charity work here.

15
00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:48,610
Get out of my gym, you slacker.

16
00:05:49,582 --> 00:05:53,582
Listen, don't let that kid in here.

17
00:07:30,716 --> 00:07:33,585
- Listen.
- Yes?

18
00:07:33,586 --> 00:07:35,020
Can I leave
when my girlfriend comes out?

19
00:07:35,021 --> 00:07:36,721
No, you're next, Abner.

20
00:07:36,722 --> 00:07:38,089
And can't I leave earlier?

21
00:07:38,090 --> 00:07:42,090
Take a seat until you're called.

22
00:07:46,632 --> 00:07:48,733
Now...

23
00:07:48,734 --> 00:07:52,734
this one's for three months,
one per day, all right?

24
00:07:56,742 --> 00:07:59,711
No, I don't need them, Doctor.
They're just in case...

25
00:07:59,712 --> 00:08:03,014
Yes, sure. Just in case.

26
00:08:03,015 --> 00:08:07,015
My mom thinks
it's better to be cautious.

27
00:08:07,653 --> 00:08:09,654
Thanks.

28
00:08:09,655 --> 00:08:13,655
You're welcome.

29
00:08:21,067 --> 00:08:23,502
Come on in, Abner.

30
00:08:23,503 --> 00:08:26,905
I'll be waiting for you.

31
00:08:26,906 --> 00:08:30,906
Take a deep breath, please.

32
00:08:32,945 --> 00:08:36,945
- Your son's still a professional fighter?
- Do it again.

33
00:08:40,786 --> 00:08:44,786
- Isn't Irwin your surname?
- Yes. Breathe.

34
00:08:48,194 --> 00:08:50,061
All right, perfect.

35
00:08:50,062 --> 00:08:54,062
- He's no longer in magazines.
- I don't know. Take a seat, please.

36
00:08:55,201 --> 00:08:58,537
- How's your asthma going?
- I'm fine, Doctor.

37
00:08:58,538 --> 00:09:02,538
- The drug has helped a lot.
- Good.

38
00:09:03,142 --> 00:09:05,243
What?

39
00:09:05,244 --> 00:09:08,947
A prescription.

40
00:09:08,948 --> 00:09:10,215
Give it to Maria.

41
00:09:10,216 --> 00:09:13,218
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

42
00:09:13,219 --> 00:09:17,219
Boxing and asthma don't blend well.

43
00:09:20,259 --> 00:09:24,259
If you need anything...
I'll be here.

44
00:09:32,104 --> 00:09:36,104
Mom.

45
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:51,320
Come.

46
00:10:24,090 --> 00:10:27,158
- Got a condom?
- What are the pills for?

47
00:10:27,159 --> 00:10:31,159
Do you think they work from day one?

48
00:12:05,391 --> 00:12:09,391
What's up, dude?
Everything's cool?

49
00:12:10,129 --> 00:12:12,997
Hey, Wilo.

50
00:12:12,998 --> 00:12:16,998
I'm gonna be a champion
like Marco Antonio Barrera, you'll see.

51
00:12:17,269 --> 00:12:18,803
Dreaming is free, my friend.

52
00:12:18,804 --> 00:12:22,340
You rather remind me
of that Alejo Morales, buddy.

53
00:12:22,341 --> 00:12:24,008
The guy's 100% from Tijuana.

54
00:12:24,009 --> 00:12:28,009
- Cheer up, Californian sunshine.
- Hey, let me be, dog.

55
00:12:28,781 --> 00:12:31,349
Look. I'm as drunk as Morales.
I'm gonna be a champion, buddy.

56
00:12:31,350 --> 00:12:34,419
- Don't I look like one?
- Yeah, right.

57
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:38,420
- Come on, have some.
- No, thanks.

58
00:12:50,136 --> 00:12:53,505
Excuse me, honey.

59
00:12:53,506 --> 00:12:55,974
Being with him pays off.

60
00:12:55,975 --> 00:12:59,975
I think of my girl
while he's sucking my dick.

61
00:13:00,813 --> 00:13:02,180
I'll see you later, honey.

62
00:13:02,181 --> 00:13:06,181
- All right.
- Take care.

63
00:14:22,261 --> 00:14:24,996
Let me go...
Let go of me!

64
00:14:24,997 --> 00:14:27,632
- What did you say?
- No!

65
00:14:27,633 --> 00:14:30,435
- Don't hit me!
- Let her go!

66
00:14:30,436 --> 00:14:34,436
Abusive bastard.

67
00:14:35,641 --> 00:14:38,109
She's a whore just like her mother.

68
00:14:38,110 --> 00:14:42,110
Worthless pig.

69
00:14:47,319 --> 00:14:51,319
- No one hits their father.
- Get out, Ana.

70
00:15:05,604 --> 00:15:09,604
All right, hit the road, you both,
just like dogs.

71
00:15:10,075 --> 00:15:14,075
And don't you come back!

72
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:18,980
Motherfuckers.

73
00:15:37,503 --> 00:15:38,603
Will you do some here?

74
00:15:38,604 --> 00:15:42,604
I can't. I got school.

75
00:15:52,084 --> 00:15:56,084
- Hey, where are you going?
- Me?

76
00:15:57,389 --> 00:16:01,389
Let's see...

77
00:16:05,431 --> 00:16:09,334
I think we're in trouble already,
aren't we?

78
00:16:09,335 --> 00:16:13,335
Look, you will help me
with something, okay?

79
00:16:13,372 --> 00:16:17,372
Listen, you bastard.
Don't talk back to me like that.

80
00:16:18,210 --> 00:16:20,244
Do you think I don't know
you're a junkie?

81
00:16:20,245 --> 00:16:22,180
That's not true.
Leave me alone, please.

82
00:16:22,181 --> 00:16:25,717
"Please," no.

83
00:16:25,718 --> 00:16:27,518
You're going to be
my petite snitch.

84
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:31,155
You will tell me who you buy this from
and who you sell it to.

85
00:16:31,156 --> 00:16:35,156
You will pay me on a weekly basis
if you don't want to end up in prison.

86
00:16:35,661 --> 00:16:39,530
Is that clear?

87
00:16:39,531 --> 00:16:43,201
Take them.

88
00:16:43,202 --> 00:16:46,170
I said I'd have the money for the gym
by tomorrow.

89
00:16:46,171 --> 00:16:50,074
No one will ever touch me, dog.

90
00:16:50,075 --> 00:16:54,075
How much do you need?
I can help you get it.

91
00:17:06,125 --> 00:17:10,125
And you'll be my assistant, huh?
You'll be my second.

92
00:17:10,429 --> 00:17:13,331
Your "second"?

93
00:17:13,332 --> 00:17:16,334
That sounds cool.

94
00:17:16,335 --> 00:17:20,271
- I mean my assistant.
- Really?

95
00:17:20,272 --> 00:17:24,272
Sure.

96
00:17:40,092 --> 00:17:42,527
- Hi, beauty. How much?
- Seven hundred.

97
00:17:42,528 --> 00:17:46,528
Get in.

98
00:17:49,768 --> 00:17:51,502
- Hi, Tere.
- Hi, girl.

99
00:17:51,503 --> 00:17:55,503
Can I have room 5?

100
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:18,129
Yeah, bro.
That's how it happened.

101
00:18:18,130 --> 00:18:22,130
- How are you all doing?
- Hey, what's up?

102
00:18:26,605 --> 00:18:30,605
- Where were you?
- Looking for you, dog.

103
00:18:43,188 --> 00:18:45,690
Wait, what's that about?

104
00:18:45,691 --> 00:18:49,691
What?
Can't I be happy to see you?

105
00:18:53,665 --> 00:18:56,434
- How can you afford them?
- I sell them.

106
00:18:56,435 --> 00:19:00,435
- No shit? Since when?
- I do it for money.

107
00:19:03,575 --> 00:19:06,577
I'll make good money.
You'll see.

108
00:19:06,578 --> 00:19:10,578
And what happens in the meantime?

109
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:25,887
Thank you.

110
00:21:00,892 --> 00:21:02,827
Yes?

111
00:21:02,828 --> 00:21:06,828
Frank, there's your son.

112
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:51,469
A bit higher!

113
00:22:51,470 --> 00:22:54,905
What's up?

114
00:22:54,906 --> 00:22:58,906
What's up?

115
00:22:59,444 --> 00:23:02,947
What do you want?

116
00:23:02,948 --> 00:23:05,516
You've come here again?

117
00:23:05,517 --> 00:23:07,651
If I learned how to box,
Don Poncho.

118
00:23:07,652 --> 00:23:10,955
Don't call me "Don,"
and we don't do charity here.

119
00:23:10,956 --> 00:23:14,725
Please.

120
00:23:14,726 --> 00:23:18,726
I just want to learn how to box.

121
00:23:20,165 --> 00:23:22,400
There are some old gloves
back there.

122
00:23:22,401 --> 00:23:26,401
For the record,
you're doing it at your own risk.

123
00:23:27,539 --> 00:23:31,539
Listen. It's $200.

124
00:23:34,679 --> 00:23:38,679
One month.

125
00:23:53,632 --> 00:23:57,632
There's the girl. Pull up.

126
00:23:58,069 --> 00:24:01,739
Get in, Paulina.

127
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:04,608
<i>We got an emergency.
Send two cars.</i>

128
00:24:04,609 --> 00:24:08,609
It wasn't Abner, I promise.
It wasn't me, either.

129
00:24:09,614 --> 00:24:13,614
The problem is they'll lock you up
if you can't prove that.

130
00:24:14,085 --> 00:24:16,887
And so what?
That will affect me negatively

131
00:24:16,888 --> 00:24:20,888
because I need you here
out on the street, working,

132
00:24:21,159 --> 00:24:25,159
not in jail, you understand?

133
00:24:32,871 --> 00:24:34,772
Hello?

134
00:24:34,773 --> 00:24:37,141
I'm Dr. Frank Irwin.

135
00:24:37,142 --> 00:24:39,210
- Manuel.
- My pleasure, Manuel.

136
00:24:39,211 --> 00:24:43,211
- American?
- Yes.

137
00:24:45,550 --> 00:24:49,550
I'm a resident.
Is this official business?

138
00:24:55,627 --> 00:24:59,627
Good, good.

139
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:05,700
Officer Manuel Quintana.

140
00:25:50,949 --> 00:25:52,616
Your English is very good.

141
00:25:52,617 --> 00:25:54,552
- Thank you!
- You're welcome.

142
00:25:54,553 --> 00:25:58,553
See to it that the money is returned.
Excuse me.

143
00:26:00,825 --> 00:26:04,825
Let's get going.

144
00:26:12,871 --> 00:26:13,837
Thank you, Doctor.

145
00:26:13,838 --> 00:26:16,707
- You don't knowwhat you saved us from.
- Yes, I do.

146
00:26:16,708 --> 00:26:20,244
It's the last time.
How much?

147
00:26:20,245 --> 00:26:24,014
- Okay, no secrets, right?
- That's right.

148
00:26:24,015 --> 00:26:26,917
- 800 pesos.
- What for?

149
00:26:26,918 --> 00:26:30,888
To pay for the gym.

150
00:26:30,889 --> 00:26:31,855
For Abner?

151
00:26:31,856 --> 00:26:35,856
Yes?
Tell him to come and see me.

152
00:26:36,628 --> 00:26:40,628
You understand?

153
00:27:39,824 --> 00:27:43,727
That bastard caught me,
and now he's got me selling for him.

154
00:27:43,728 --> 00:27:47,728
You see?
What are you going to do now?

155
00:27:47,932 --> 00:27:50,200
Do I have a choice?

156
00:27:50,201 --> 00:27:52,936
It's all fucked up, right?

157
00:27:52,937 --> 00:27:56,937
The thing is I have less money now.

158
00:27:59,811 --> 00:28:02,946
- You wanted two, right?
- Yes.

159
00:28:02,947 --> 00:28:06,283
- How much is this?
- 100.

160
00:28:06,284 --> 00:28:10,284
No, it's 100 each.

161
00:28:18,830 --> 00:28:22,830
- Who did that to you?
- My fucking father.

162
00:28:23,802 --> 00:28:27,802
You should send him to hell.
Come to my place.

163
00:28:28,306 --> 00:28:30,741
Abner stood up for me.

164
00:28:30,742 --> 00:28:34,742
He adores you.

165
00:28:34,846 --> 00:28:38,846
Please, don't tell him you saw me.
I gotta go.

166
00:31:12,270 --> 00:31:16,270
Well, Doctor...

167
00:31:18,509 --> 00:31:21,979
Rigoberto, this gentleman here
has offered to pay you back

168
00:31:21,980 --> 00:31:24,915
the money that you accuse your son
of stealing from you.

169
00:31:24,916 --> 00:31:26,583
And who's the guy?

170
00:31:26,584 --> 00:31:30,584
He's the guy who'll pay you back,
all right?

171
00:31:30,922 --> 00:31:34,922
Please.

172
00:31:40,031 --> 00:31:44,031
You could still scare the damn kid
so he learns his lesson.

173
00:31:44,569 --> 00:31:48,569
You got your money already.
I'll take care of the rest.

174
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:53,440
Whatever you say,
my beautiful Manuelito.

175
00:31:55,079 --> 00:31:58,949
- Give him a scare?
- Don't worry about a thing.

176
00:31:58,950 --> 00:32:02,319
Nothing will happen to the kid.
I'll see to that.

177
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:04,454
Thank you, Doctor.
Thank you very much.

178
00:32:04,455 --> 00:32:08,455
You're welcome.

179
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:39,520
Your jaw.

180
00:32:43,628 --> 00:32:46,530
Your bending, your bending.

181
00:32:46,531 --> 00:32:50,531
Your waist, your waist.

182
00:32:58,242 --> 00:33:02,242
Do it all over again and tough!

183
00:33:08,186 --> 00:33:12,186
Repeat everything.

184
00:33:13,691 --> 00:33:16,727
Time's up!

185
00:33:16,728 --> 00:33:19,763
Kid... kid...

186
00:33:19,764 --> 00:33:23,764
Would you like to spar with him?

187
00:33:24,669 --> 00:33:26,136
We have no protection.

188
00:33:26,137 --> 00:33:30,137
But we do.
Come on, just some short rounds.

189
00:33:30,274 --> 00:33:33,744
Tomorrow perhaps.

190
00:33:33,745 --> 00:33:35,612
What, your fighter is scared?

191
00:33:35,613 --> 00:33:39,613
- All right, then.
- But that guy's a pro.

192
00:33:40,685 --> 00:33:44,685
He'll beat you up.

193
00:33:49,427 --> 00:33:53,427
It's 80 pesos,
you know, because of the traffic.

194
00:34:06,110 --> 00:34:10,110
- Easy, bro, huh?
- We're ready.

195
00:34:22,794 --> 00:34:25,829
Come on, cover up!
Come on, yes, come on!

196
00:34:25,830 --> 00:34:28,498
Wear him down.

197
00:34:28,499 --> 00:34:31,234
- Cover up!
- Body and head.

198
00:34:31,235 --> 00:34:35,235
- Body and head.
- Cover up!

199
00:34:37,642 --> 00:34:40,410
Come on, go for him.

200
00:34:40,411 --> 00:34:44,411
- Cover up!
- Your teeth.

201
00:34:45,416 --> 00:34:49,416
Wear him down.

202
00:34:49,587 --> 00:34:53,390
Cover up!
Come on, cover up!

203
00:34:53,391 --> 00:34:57,391
Cover your face.

204
00:34:58,262 --> 00:35:00,730
- Follow him.
- Come on.

205
00:35:00,731 --> 00:35:04,731
Your waist.

206
00:35:05,436 --> 00:35:07,137
Come on, come on.

207
00:35:07,138 --> 00:35:08,538
Get out of there.
Go to him, come on.

208
00:35:08,539 --> 00:35:11,374
- Yes.
- Get out of there!

209
00:35:11,375 --> 00:35:13,610
Wear him down.
That's it.

210
00:35:13,611 --> 00:35:15,345
- That's it.
- Get out of there.

211
00:35:15,346 --> 00:35:19,346
- Cover up, cover your face.
- A hook!

212
00:35:26,224 --> 00:35:30,224
Yes, that's just right.

213
00:35:30,595 --> 00:35:31,828
- Cover up!
- Beat him up.

214
00:35:31,829 --> 00:35:35,432
Get out of there.

215
00:35:35,433 --> 00:35:39,433
Again.

216
00:35:42,507 --> 00:35:46,507
Repeat that.

217
00:35:47,512 --> 00:35:51,512
One, two...

218
00:35:55,553 --> 00:35:58,188
Let me see, kid.

219
00:35:58,189 --> 00:35:59,890
You're fine, man.
It's nothing.

220
00:35:59,891 --> 00:36:01,925
What the fuck, Raul.
What have you done?

221
00:36:01,926 --> 00:36:03,693
Don't come to the gym
to take advantage of newbies.

222
00:36:03,694 --> 00:36:06,830
It's no big deal.
Just for fun, Ponchito.

223
00:36:06,831 --> 00:36:08,865
And you should learn your lesson.

224
00:36:08,866 --> 00:36:12,866
You get angry, you lose.

225
00:36:14,405 --> 00:36:16,439
- Let's go.
- Just ignore them.

226
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:17,807
Let me see.

227
00:36:17,808 --> 00:36:21,211
Excuse me.

228
00:36:21,212 --> 00:36:23,713
How much?

229
00:36:23,714 --> 00:36:27,714
You are a pro, right?

230
00:36:35,726 --> 00:36:39,726
It's 200 pesos a week.

231
00:36:41,866 --> 00:36:45,866
Very cheap... cheap.

232
00:36:52,877 --> 00:36:56,877
And I'm Poncho.

233
00:37:57,041 --> 00:38:01,041
Good evening.
Is Dr. Frank in?

234
00:38:12,857 --> 00:38:14,291
Thanks.

235
00:38:14,292 --> 00:38:18,292
You're welcome.

236
00:41:41,699 --> 00:41:43,533
Good morning.

237
00:41:43,534 --> 00:41:47,534
Good morning.
Take a seat.

238
00:41:50,508 --> 00:41:53,142
Listen, young man.

239
00:41:53,143 --> 00:41:57,143
I paid back the money
you stole from your father.

240
00:41:57,915 --> 00:42:01,684
- You understand?
- I didn't steal it.

241
00:42:01,685 --> 00:42:03,987
He owed it to me
for all the fights I've won.

242
00:42:03,988 --> 00:42:07,988
Look, he keeps all the bids
for himself.

243
00:42:08,025 --> 00:42:10,727
He takes as much as he can
from my sister and me.

244
00:42:10,728 --> 00:42:14,728
Now I understand.

245
00:42:17,001 --> 00:42:19,235
- Want some eggs?
- Thanks.

246
00:42:19,236 --> 00:42:23,236
Good, there's some beans,
orange juice...

247
00:42:42,860 --> 00:42:45,061
I think it's broken.

248
00:42:45,062 --> 00:42:49,062
Let's see.

249
00:42:54,104 --> 00:42:56,105
It's not broken.

250
00:42:56,106 --> 00:42:57,774
Boxing...

251
00:42:57,775 --> 00:43:01,775
all that glitters is not gold.

252
00:43:03,914 --> 00:43:07,584
- Thanks for receiving me last night.
- You're welcome.

253
00:43:07,585 --> 00:43:09,252
I got a proposal.

254
00:43:09,253 --> 00:43:13,253
Lend a hand at the clinic
and go to school,

255
00:43:13,757 --> 00:43:16,926
and you can stay here.

256
00:43:16,927 --> 00:43:19,028
Okay?

257
00:43:19,029 --> 00:43:23,029
- I don't wanna be a burden, Doctor.
- Call me Frank, please.

258
00:43:26,337 --> 00:43:29,806
I just want to be a professional boxer.

259
00:43:29,807 --> 00:43:32,108
Like your son.

260
00:43:32,109 --> 00:43:36,109
It was him last night, wasn't it?

261
00:43:36,780 --> 00:43:39,682
Yes.

262
00:43:39,683 --> 00:43:43,683
I can lend a hand at the clinic.

263
00:43:44,855 --> 00:43:48,391
I'd stay here for just a few days.

264
00:43:48,392 --> 00:43:52,028
As for school, we'll see, okay?

265
00:43:52,029 --> 00:43:56,029
It's better than nothing.

266
00:43:56,634 --> 00:44:00,634
Yes?

267
00:44:04,274 --> 00:44:08,274
Where do you want...
I'm sorry.

268
00:44:21,792 --> 00:44:25,792
- Here's the key, Teresita.
- Thank you, child.

269
00:44:30,267 --> 00:44:32,835
No answer...

270
00:44:32,836 --> 00:44:36,836
No answer.

271
00:45:13,377 --> 00:45:15,845
Listen...

272
00:45:15,846 --> 00:45:18,815
Hey, you...

273
00:45:18,816 --> 00:45:22,816
You're the doctor's son, right?

274
00:45:33,263 --> 00:45:37,263
Cool.

275
00:45:54,418 --> 00:45:58,287
It's Jimmy Irwin
or something like that, in room 28.

276
00:45:58,288 --> 00:46:01,491
Room 28?

277
00:46:01,492 --> 00:46:05,361
- Thank you, sweetheart.
- Thanks.

278
00:46:05,362 --> 00:46:08,397
What's up?

279
00:46:08,398 --> 00:46:10,433
I'm training at the gym.

280
00:46:10,434 --> 00:46:14,434
Yes, I can tell.
Look at your nose.

281
00:46:15,506 --> 00:46:17,006
Listen.

282
00:46:17,007 --> 00:46:21,007
Dad's looking for you.

283
00:46:21,512 --> 00:46:25,512
- You've been at the house?
- And where else could I go?

284
00:46:26,183 --> 00:46:29,886
Come with me.

285
00:46:29,887 --> 00:46:32,054
No.

286
00:46:32,055 --> 00:46:34,524
- He needs me.
- Cut the crap, Silvana.

287
00:46:34,525 --> 00:46:38,525
Send him to hell
and come with me.

288
00:46:38,962 --> 00:46:42,962
Listen, we'll talk later.

289
00:46:44,434 --> 00:46:46,836
- What are you doing?
- Nothing. Just talking, but I'm done.

290
00:46:46,837 --> 00:46:49,105
Yeah, I saw.
But you're working, right?

291
00:46:49,106 --> 00:46:53,106
Yes.

292
00:46:56,814 --> 00:47:00,349
Jimmy?

293
00:47:00,350 --> 00:47:04,350
Thanks.

294
00:47:15,332 --> 00:47:19,332
Abner... my angel.

295
00:47:38,388 --> 00:47:40,990
A coach, yes.

296
00:47:40,991 --> 00:47:44,991
Yeah, I think he does need one.

297
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:07,280
Jesus Christ? Why?

298
00:48:30,040 --> 00:48:34,040
One lesson... tomorrow.

299
00:48:36,313 --> 00:48:40,313
But, please, don't tell Abner that...
I'm sorry.

300
00:48:41,184 --> 00:48:45,184
Howwas that?

301
00:49:06,076 --> 00:49:07,576
What's up, daddy?

302
00:49:07,577 --> 00:49:10,012
Hi... It's 800.

303
00:49:10,013 --> 00:49:11,614
- Do you like me?
- Hello, handsome.

304
00:49:11,615 --> 00:49:15,615
- Hi, doll. How much?
- It's 700.

305
00:49:19,056 --> 00:49:22,491
- Ana.
- Hey, now here's a miracle!

306
00:49:22,492 --> 00:49:25,294
- Where were you?
- Someplace.

307
00:49:25,295 --> 00:49:28,030
- I went out with Jimmy.
- Jimmy?

308
00:49:28,031 --> 00:49:31,233
- Oh, the gringo?
- Yes.

309
00:49:31,234 --> 00:49:32,635
I think he likes me.

310
00:49:32,636 --> 00:49:34,437
- And do you like him?
- Yes.

311
00:49:34,438 --> 00:49:36,539
That's so cool.

312
00:49:36,540 --> 00:49:40,509
I'm not too hopeful, though.

313
00:49:40,510 --> 00:49:43,980
Listen, Xavier is pissed off.
He's looking for you.

314
00:49:43,981 --> 00:49:46,549
He says he'll beat you up
the moment he finds you.

315
00:49:46,550 --> 00:49:49,986
He should think twice...
because my boyfriend's a boxer.

316
00:49:49,987 --> 00:49:52,488
He'll end up injured.

317
00:49:52,489 --> 00:49:56,489
And doesn't he have a friend?

318
00:50:25,622 --> 00:50:28,557
What do you think, kid?
You've got someone to train you.

319
00:50:28,558 --> 00:50:30,359
Yeah.

320
00:50:30,360 --> 00:50:33,529
Wouldn't a Mexican be better?
They're the best.

321
00:50:33,530 --> 00:50:37,199
Yes, that's true,
but none sees your potential.

322
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:41,200
Just this guy.

323
00:50:42,506 --> 00:50:44,774
Thank you, huh?

324
00:50:44,775 --> 00:50:48,775
Thanks.

325
00:50:52,482 --> 00:50:55,184
- Good morning, Eduardo.
- Morning.

326
00:50:55,185 --> 00:50:58,187
Hi, Carmen.
Oh, potatoes.

327
00:50:58,188 --> 00:51:00,289
Potatoes?
Please, pick them yourself.

328
00:51:00,290 --> 00:51:02,458
All right.
How are you doing?

329
00:51:02,459 --> 00:51:05,227
- Good, thanks. And you?
- Fine, thanks.

330
00:51:05,228 --> 00:51:09,228
It's 10 pesos.

331
00:51:10,133 --> 00:51:14,133
Okay, here you are. Thank you.

332
00:51:14,538 --> 00:51:18,140
Thanks. Good-bye, Carmen.
Good-bye, Eduardo.

333
00:51:18,141 --> 00:51:22,141
Good-bye, see you later.

334
00:52:33,617 --> 00:52:37,617
Fast.

335
00:53:11,488 --> 00:53:13,522
Thanks.

336
00:53:13,523 --> 00:53:17,523
Thank you very much.

337
00:53:22,799 --> 00:53:26,799
Better, huh?

338
00:53:46,323 --> 00:53:49,291
Breathe... Good.

339
00:53:49,292 --> 00:53:53,292
- I thought you weren't coming.
- I'm sorry.

340
00:54:17,020 --> 00:54:19,855
Elias, what's up?

341
00:54:19,856 --> 00:54:23,856
Okay.

342
00:54:42,579 --> 00:54:46,579
- Hello.
- Hi, Dr. Frank.

343
00:54:53,690 --> 00:54:57,690
I'll be right back.

344
00:55:24,754 --> 00:55:28,754
Hello?

345
00:55:29,459 --> 00:55:33,459
I'll be there in a minute.

346
00:55:46,876 --> 00:55:50,876
Your blood pressure is too high,
but you don't have a fever.

347
00:55:54,017 --> 00:55:57,019
Look this way.

348
00:55:57,020 --> 00:55:59,588
Now this way.

349
00:55:59,589 --> 00:56:03,589
This way.

350
00:56:15,939 --> 00:56:19,939
Calm down.

351
00:56:34,057 --> 00:56:37,960
Better?

352
00:56:37,961 --> 00:56:40,462
Good.

353
00:56:40,463 --> 00:56:44,463
No secrets, right?

354
00:56:52,442 --> 00:56:55,911
Amphetamines, Doctor...

355
00:56:55,912 --> 00:56:59,581
every single day.

356
00:56:59,582 --> 00:57:03,582
Amphetamines could kill you.

357
00:57:03,653 --> 00:57:07,122
What about Abner?

358
00:57:07,123 --> 00:57:09,792
No, he hates them.

359
00:57:09,793 --> 00:57:13,793
Are you sure?

360
00:57:17,967 --> 00:57:21,967
I don't want my mom to find out.

361
00:57:22,639 --> 00:57:24,673
Yes, yes. No problem.

362
00:57:24,674 --> 00:57:27,776
But do help me.

363
00:57:27,777 --> 00:57:31,777
Stay calm.

364
00:58:00,477 --> 00:58:03,011
Come here.

365
00:58:03,012 --> 00:58:04,980
Come.

366
00:58:04,981 --> 00:58:08,981
All of you, come here.

367
00:58:18,561 --> 00:58:19,761
If you're ready...

368
00:58:19,762 --> 00:58:23,762
in two weeks' time
we'll have a fight for beginners.

369
00:58:27,003 --> 00:58:31,003
Yes... I'm ready.

370
00:58:40,049 --> 00:58:41,950
Is this enough oil and vinegar?

371
00:58:41,951 --> 00:58:45,951
Yes, it's perfect.

372
00:58:50,293 --> 00:58:54,293
Hello, boys.

373
00:58:54,531 --> 00:58:57,833
Take a seat.

374
00:58:57,834 --> 00:59:01,834
We'll need more salad
and more meat.

375
00:59:02,906 --> 00:59:06,906
Sit down, my friends.

376
00:59:19,222 --> 00:59:23,222
I'll have my first fight in two weeks.

377
01:00:04,968 --> 01:00:08,968
I'm ready.

378
01:00:09,839 --> 01:00:13,839
He's ready.
We're gonna be rich.

379
01:01:00,890 --> 01:01:03,425
Let's see...

380
01:01:03,426 --> 01:01:06,962
How come you're not selling anymore?

381
01:01:06,963 --> 01:01:09,064
I quit taking them.

382
01:01:09,065 --> 01:01:12,367
Besides I'm ill.

383
01:01:12,368 --> 01:01:14,102
You're ill?

384
01:01:14,103 --> 01:01:18,103
That's better because you won't take
half the pills I give you.

385
01:01:22,045 --> 01:01:25,947
What about 2000 a week?

386
01:01:25,948 --> 01:01:29,948
Leave me alone.
I want out, please.

387
01:01:32,955 --> 01:01:36,955
Drive up to him.

388
01:01:51,841 --> 01:01:55,841
Two thousand, huh?

389
01:01:57,480 --> 01:02:00,348
What's your business with that jerk?

390
01:02:00,349 --> 01:02:02,417
He feels entitled to slap your ass
just because?

391
01:02:02,418 --> 01:02:05,320
I told him I want out
and that I won't...

392
01:02:05,321 --> 01:02:09,321
Now he's got you selling for him,
next he'll have you suck his dick.

393
01:02:09,459 --> 01:02:13,459
You think? Should I wait
till you earn something boxing?

394
01:02:15,131 --> 01:02:19,131
You only think of yourself.
You don't even listen to me.

395
01:02:42,125 --> 01:02:46,125
This is just like...

396
01:02:47,296 --> 01:02:51,296
Yes.

397
01:04:20,356 --> 01:04:22,991
All right,
but you tell her to be there.

398
01:04:22,992 --> 01:04:26,992
Tonight, okay?
Yes, that's fine.

399
01:04:26,996 --> 01:04:30,996
All right, bye.

400
01:05:01,464 --> 01:05:05,464
Time's up!

401
01:05:19,015 --> 01:05:20,515
Ask him what about him and Silvana.

402
01:05:20,516 --> 01:05:21,516
Why me?

403
01:05:21,517 --> 01:05:23,685
Because your English is better.

404
01:05:23,686 --> 01:05:25,153
Ask him yourself.
She's your sister.

405
01:05:25,154 --> 01:05:29,154
Can't you fucking ask him?

406
01:05:41,971 --> 01:05:43,438
Don't talk like that, dude.

407
01:05:43,439 --> 01:05:47,439
I don't want to see
the two of you together again.

408
01:06:23,312 --> 01:06:27,312
Sir, you've got a phone call.

409
01:06:37,493 --> 01:06:41,493
Thanks.

410
01:08:23,566 --> 01:08:27,566
Who the fuck are you?

411
01:10:12,775 --> 01:10:16,775
What's up?

412
01:10:17,980 --> 01:10:21,980
What is it?

413
01:10:26,655 --> 01:10:30,655
Silvana's been murdered.

414
01:10:30,893 --> 01:10:34,893
How?

415
01:10:35,331 --> 01:10:39,331
Jimmy's in prison.

416
01:11:01,657 --> 01:11:05,657
Listen...

417
01:11:44,300 --> 01:11:45,900
Listen...

418
01:11:45,901 --> 01:11:49,901
Motherfucker,
I told you to stay away from her.

419
01:11:50,372 --> 01:11:52,307
Hey, no shouting in here.

420
01:11:52,308 --> 01:11:53,341
Get out of here!

421
01:11:53,342 --> 01:11:57,342
Get out!

422
01:11:57,613 --> 01:11:59,013
Let go of me!

423
01:11:59,014 --> 01:12:01,382
Fucking murderer! Why?

424
01:12:01,383 --> 01:12:05,383
Let go of me!
Fucking murderer!

425
01:12:15,731 --> 01:12:18,333
Take it easy, dude.

426
01:12:18,334 --> 01:12:21,769
You need to be in shape for the fight.

427
01:12:21,770 --> 01:12:24,439
Calm down, champion.

428
01:12:24,440 --> 01:12:28,440
Don't call me a champion.

429
01:12:29,478 --> 01:12:33,478
Why couldn't she just run away?

430
01:12:45,828 --> 01:12:48,963
What's up, bastard?
Fuck off, you fag!

431
01:12:48,964 --> 01:12:52,964
Fuck off, you sucker!

432
01:13:29,037 --> 01:13:33,037
Come here.

433
01:13:39,548 --> 01:13:42,650
Forgive me.

434
01:13:42,651 --> 01:13:46,651
I was awful with you.

435
01:13:47,089 --> 01:13:51,089
I love you very much.

436
01:13:55,063 --> 01:13:56,931
And I love you.

437
01:13:56,932 --> 01:14:00,932
And I'm here with you.

438
01:14:01,870 --> 01:14:03,738
You'll need all of your energy
for your first fight.

439
01:14:03,739 --> 01:14:06,874
No sex, dude.

440
01:14:06,875 --> 01:14:10,875
Come on, champ.

441
01:14:40,742 --> 01:14:44,742
Thank you, sir.

442
01:16:20,042 --> 01:16:22,677
177 pounds.

443
01:16:22,678 --> 01:16:26,678
You may step down.

444
01:16:27,749 --> 01:16:31,749
Next fighters, Abner Torres
and José Daniel Evangelista.

445
01:16:40,662 --> 01:16:44,662
132.7 pounds.

446
01:16:54,109 --> 01:16:56,744
I'll hit you so fast,
you'll think you're surrounded.

447
01:16:56,745 --> 01:16:58,913
- What's your problem?
- Easy, boys!

448
01:16:58,914 --> 01:17:02,914
Raul, I'm warning you,
make sure your kid behaves himself.

449
01:17:03,151 --> 01:17:06,387
And you, kid,
where's your coach?

450
01:17:06,388 --> 01:17:09,223
I can't let you fight
without your coach.

451
01:17:09,224 --> 01:17:12,293
- That's official.
- And why not?

452
01:17:12,294 --> 01:17:16,294
That is official.

453
01:17:24,006 --> 01:17:26,173
This is my coach.

454
01:17:26,174 --> 01:17:30,174
- Pardon me?
- My coach.

455
01:17:31,146 --> 01:17:35,146
It's okay, Doctor.
We'll pretend you are his coach.

456
01:17:35,817 --> 01:17:39,817
- Is that all right?
- All right, thanks.

457
01:17:40,422 --> 01:17:43,324
I don't know anything.

458
01:17:43,325 --> 01:17:45,159
- This is Wilo.
- It's a pleasure.

459
01:17:45,160 --> 01:17:49,160
Nice to meet you.

460
01:17:56,972 --> 01:18:00,972
132.4 pounds.

461
01:18:14,823 --> 01:18:18,823
Behind the bars, dude.

462
01:18:35,110 --> 01:18:39,110
Like this?
All right, here.

463
01:18:41,116 --> 01:18:44,385
Please, wait a minute.

464
01:18:44,386 --> 01:18:46,954
What the hell,
I'm not Jimmy.

465
01:18:46,955 --> 01:18:50,491
Set your legs like this.
That's right.

466
01:18:50,492 --> 01:18:53,427
- Over here?
- Yes. Keep them firm.

467
01:18:53,428 --> 01:18:57,428
That's it. Here.
Okay, one, two...

468
01:19:00,135 --> 01:19:04,135
That's right.

469
01:19:04,840 --> 01:19:07,408
Ready?
We only have five minutes.

470
01:19:07,409 --> 01:19:11,278
Okay?

471
01:19:11,279 --> 01:19:15,279
It wasn't Jimmy.

472
01:19:18,420 --> 01:19:19,820
Don't talk to him about that.

473
01:19:19,821 --> 01:19:23,821
His sister's death still affects him.

474
01:19:23,925 --> 01:19:27,925
I'm sorry.

475
01:19:54,790 --> 01:19:58,425
She was my friend.

476
01:19:58,426 --> 01:20:02,426
I loved her very much.

477
01:20:08,203 --> 01:20:12,203
I'm going to see Abner.

478
01:20:16,344 --> 01:20:18,179
Come with me.

479
01:20:18,180 --> 01:20:22,180
Silvana wanted for you
to take care of him at the fight.

480
01:20:42,003 --> 01:20:46,003
Round one!

481
01:20:47,342 --> 01:20:51,342
In the red corner,
Santa Julia's pride...

482
01:20:52,514 --> 01:20:56,514
Abner "The Kid" Torres!

483
01:20:59,087 --> 01:21:03,087
In the blue corner,
lztacalco's idol...

484
01:21:03,992 --> 01:21:07,992
José Daniel Evangelista!

485
01:21:10,432 --> 01:21:12,533
On this occasion,
the referee will be

486
01:21:12,534 --> 01:21:15,970
Rafa "Blond" Saldivar!

487
01:21:15,971 --> 01:21:19,971
Boys, come nearer.

488
01:21:20,642 --> 01:21:22,309
I want a fair fight.

489
01:21:22,310 --> 01:21:23,944
Low blows are forbidden.

490
01:21:23,945 --> 01:21:26,614
When you hear the bell,
you must stop fighting at once.

491
01:21:26,615 --> 01:21:28,549
When I say to separate,
you separate.

492
01:21:28,550 --> 01:21:31,018
Any questions?
Any questions?

493
01:21:31,019 --> 01:21:33,053
All right, touch gloves.

494
01:21:33,054 --> 01:21:35,222
It's on.

495
01:21:35,223 --> 01:21:39,223
You can win.

496
01:21:49,571 --> 01:21:53,571
Come on! Come on!

497
01:22:05,921 --> 01:22:09,657
Hit him hard!

498
01:22:09,658 --> 01:22:12,493
Destroy him, buddy!

499
01:22:12,494 --> 01:22:14,295
Break it up!

500
01:22:14,296 --> 01:22:16,263
I said break it up!

501
01:22:16,264 --> 01:22:20,264
Go after him again!

502
01:22:31,413 --> 01:22:32,947
Scum!

503
01:22:32,948 --> 01:22:36,948
Break it up! Break it up!

504
01:22:55,270 --> 01:22:56,704
Three... four...

505
01:22:56,705 --> 01:23:00,705
Five...

506
01:23:07,716 --> 01:23:11,716
Time's up!
Go to the corners.

507
01:23:16,424 --> 01:23:20,424
Are you all right?

508
01:23:21,696 --> 01:23:23,197
What's he doing here?

509
01:23:23,198 --> 01:23:26,600
- We need him.
- No, I don't want his help.

510
01:23:26,601 --> 01:23:28,402
No, it's very important.

511
01:23:28,403 --> 01:23:31,405
Kid...

512
01:23:31,406 --> 01:23:33,674
Go inside.

513
01:23:33,675 --> 01:23:35,476
Straight punches.

514
01:23:35,477 --> 01:23:37,344
Follow him.
He keeps pulling back.

515
01:23:37,345 --> 01:23:40,280
Stay on him all the time.

516
01:23:40,281 --> 01:23:41,715
Don't pull back.

517
01:23:41,716 --> 01:23:45,716
This round is yours.
Go for it!

518
01:23:47,422 --> 01:23:51,422
Relax.

519
01:23:51,559 --> 01:23:54,628
Relax.
You can win.

520
01:23:54,629 --> 01:23:58,629
Stay calm. Come on!

521
01:24:03,505 --> 01:24:07,505
On guard!

522
01:24:13,381 --> 01:24:17,381
Block his blows!

523
01:24:29,164 --> 01:24:33,164
You're welcome, son.

524
01:24:40,508 --> 01:24:42,676
Break! Break it up!

525
01:24:42,677 --> 01:24:46,677
Time's up! Time's up!
To the corner!

526
01:24:54,856 --> 01:24:58,459
Jimmy is very sorry about Silvana.

527
01:24:58,460 --> 01:25:02,460
He lost her, too.

528
01:25:04,232 --> 01:25:08,232
I'm truly sorry.

529
01:25:12,173 --> 01:25:14,241
What the fuck is wrong with you?

530
01:25:14,242 --> 01:25:17,578
You're letting your guard down.

531
01:25:17,579 --> 01:25:19,379
Stay on top of him.
Don't let him go.

532
01:25:19,380 --> 01:25:20,747
Stay on him.

533
01:25:20,748 --> 01:25:24,748
Take care.

534
01:26:04,159 --> 01:26:08,159
Break it up! Break it up!

535
01:26:16,604 --> 01:26:18,338
One... two...

536
01:26:18,339 --> 01:26:22,309
- Stand up!
- Three... four...
