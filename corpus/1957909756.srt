1
00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:03,490
Grant me the serenity

2
00:00:03,510 --> 00:00:06,035
to accept the things
I cannot change,

3
00:00:06,055 --> 00:00:08,702
the courage to
change the things I can,

4
00:00:08,722 --> 00:00:11,370
and the wisdom to
know the difference.

5
00:00:11,390 --> 00:00:12,370
Thank you.

6
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:16,500
We have a new member joining
our program this week.

7
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:19,980
I know she just moved
into her new place.

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,053
How are you settling in, Julia?

9
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:26,045
Yeah, hi, I'm Julia.

10
00:00:26,065 --> 00:00:27,900
I'm an alcoholic.

11
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:30,730
Hi, Julia.

12
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:32,463
Yeah, I was living
with my sister,

13
00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:40,190
but I knew I needed to take
control of my life and get away.

14
00:00:41,970 --> 00:00:46,115
So this place is not
Costa Rica, but it's mine.

15
00:00:46,135 --> 00:00:50,280
And as long as I come to
these, I can have that.

16
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:55,280
So yeah, here I am.

17
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:00,450
Anything else, Julia?

18
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:06,093
Alright, thank you, Julia.

19
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:11,220
Let's see, we have a few
announcements before we start.

20
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:13,951
We'll have two
10-minute speakers...

21
00:01:42,292 --> 00:01:44,042
Thank you so much.

22
00:02:33,553 --> 00:02:36,920

23
00:02:36,940 --> 00:02:40,287

The serenity

33
00:03:49,586 --> 00:03:51,575
to accept the things
I cannot change,

34
00:03:51,595 --> 00:03:53,585
the courage to
change the things I...

35
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:53,652
Yeah, if you could
just double check

36
00:04:53,672 --> 00:04:55,485
that I didn't actually
purchase those?

37
00:04:55,505 --> 00:04:58,149
Could you spell your address?

38
00:04:58,169 --> 00:05:00,813
1038, Cypress, C-Y-P-R-E-S-S.

39
00:05:01,825 --> 00:05:02,684
Thank you.

40
00:05:03,690 --> 00:05:06,300
Can I put you on a brief
hold as I find this for you?

41
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:07,379
Sure.

42
00:05:29,859 --> 00:05:30,990
Hello, is Julia still there?

43
00:05:31,010 --> 00:05:31,900
Yup.

44
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:33,197
Hi, I'm here.

45
00:05:33,217 --> 00:05:34,490
I
just went through your account.

46
00:05:34,510 --> 00:05:35,763
The last charge
we have on record

47
00:05:35,783 --> 00:05:38,176
is a purchase totaling
140 dollars and 23 cents

48
00:05:38,196 --> 00:05:40,793
That includes a wallpaper
smoothing tool kit--

49
00:05:40,813 --> 00:05:43,410
I know, these are packages
that I received today

50
00:05:43,430 --> 00:05:44,710
with your label on them.

51
00:05:44,730 --> 00:05:46,800
I don't know if I have an old
account that's been hijacked

52
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:49,820
or what, I just wanna
know what's going on!

53
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:50,633
I apologize

54
00:05:50,653 --> 00:05:53,410
for any inconvenience
this might have caused.

55
00:05:53,430 --> 00:05:56,640
Mistakes like these can happen
at our warehouse sometimes.

56
00:05:56,660 --> 00:05:59,160
You're welcome to
return the items to us,

57
00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:00,580
or if you wanna hold on to them-

58
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:02,115
That's fine, I'll
just return them.

59
00:06:03,232 --> 00:06:04,065
Sounds great.

60
00:06:04,898 --> 00:06:06,478
Is there anything else I
can help you with today?

61
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,940
Hi there, someone is
posting reviews in my name

62
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:07,410
for items I did not order.

63
00:07:07,430 --> 00:07:08,254
Hi.

64
00:07:08,274 --> 00:07:09,078
Yes,

65
00:07:09,098 --> 00:07:10,825
I'm calling because my credit
card has been compromised.

66
00:07:10,845 --> 00:07:12,572
Can you please transfer me
to your security department?

67
00:07:12,592 --> 00:07:14,072
Please, continue to hold

68
00:07:14,092 --> 00:07:15,409
and we will be with you shortly.

69
00:07:15,429 --> 00:07:17,304
Yeah, I need you guys
to track a package for me.

70
00:07:17,324 --> 00:07:19,200
I'm getting things from
an unsolicited sender.

71
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:20,820
The number is 773-3028.

72
00:07:23,015 --> 00:07:23,959
Hello?

73
00:07:23,979 --> 00:07:24,903
Yes!

74
00:07:24,923 --> 00:07:27,197
Hi, I'm here.

75
00:07:27,217 --> 00:07:29,057
Is Fran still there?

76
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:34,053
It's Julia, Julia
Day, 1038, Cypress Lane.

77
00:07:35,165 --> 00:07:36,143
One second.

78
00:07:38,085 --> 00:07:39,170
Jesus Christ.

79
00:07:41,783 --> 00:07:42,970
Yes, Julia,

80
00:07:42,990 --> 00:07:45,220
I'm looking at your
account history right now.

81
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:48,193
It appears the reviews mentioned
are not under your account.

82
00:07:48,213 --> 00:07:50,110
I see here the most
recent use of your account

83
00:07:50,130 --> 00:07:52,440
was a purchase totalling
140 dollars and 23 cents...

84
00:07:52,460 --> 00:07:53,890
Yes, I know that, okay?

85
00:07:53,910 --> 00:07:56,660
Another user is posting
reviews for products

86
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:59,430
under an account, but
with my name, okay?

87
00:07:59,450 --> 00:08:01,767
I need you to shut them down.

88
00:08:01,787 --> 00:08:03,180
I understand, ma'am.

89
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:04,030
Unfortunately,

90
00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:06,155
I can't share any details
about other accounts,

91
00:08:06,175 --> 00:08:08,260
but I'm looking at your
information right now

92
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:10,890
and I can assure you,
your account has not been compromised.

93
00:08:10,910 --> 00:08:12,250
No, you're not
listening to me, alright?

94
00:08:12,270 --> 00:08:15,759
I am being frauded,
alright, do you understand?

95
00:08:15,779 --> 00:08:16,572
You're not.

96
00:08:16,592 --> 00:08:17,425
Is there anything else I can--

97
00:08:29,850 --> 00:08:30,811
Julia, thank God.

98
00:08:30,831 --> 00:08:31,773
Are you okay?

99
00:08:31,793 --> 00:08:33,700
Tat, no, listen...

100
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:36,570
I think someone's
targeting me or something,

101
00:08:36,590 --> 00:08:37,383
like someone's like...

102
00:08:37,403 --> 00:08:39,160
No, no, Julia, it's okay.

103
00:08:39,180 --> 00:08:41,620
I just read your text
and I looked it up,

104
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:44,283
and what's happening to
you is called brushing.

105
00:08:45,690 --> 00:08:47,080
Brushing?

106
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:49,480
Yeah, brushing...
it's like this scam

107
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:51,810
where some asshole gets
paid to send you products

108
00:08:51,830 --> 00:08:54,140
so they can write a 'verified'
review in your name.

109
00:08:57,900 --> 00:08:59,110
They want reviews?

110
00:08:59,130 --> 00:09:00,602
So long as there's proof

111
00:09:00,622 --> 00:09:01,959
the product shipped to someone,

112
00:09:01,979 --> 00:09:04,110
they write verified
reviews for money.

113
00:09:04,130 --> 00:09:04,943
It's completely a scam.

114
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:14,490
It's really shitty...

115
00:09:14,510 --> 00:09:15,490
No, I...

116
00:09:16,273 --> 00:09:18,206
I mean, they had
all my information, I...

117
00:09:19,076 --> 00:09:20,290
I had to change my card.

118
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:21,580
That's what's
so weird about it,

119
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:25,165
they don't charge anyone's
cards. They just want reviews.

120
00:09:25,185 --> 00:09:28,750
And so people end up with a
bunch of crap... but that's it.

121
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:33,243
They sent me a corkscrew.

122
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:36,400
What?

123
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:38,883
They sent me a corkscrew!

124
00:09:42,528 --> 00:09:45,715
I thought maybe they knew
that... I don't know.

125
00:09:45,735 --> 00:09:49,240
No... I think
it's just a coincidence.

126
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:50,093
Check to see if it was
a sponsored product.

127
00:09:53,370 --> 00:09:54,770
I think that's what they do.

128
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:04,653
It's just a stupid,
random thing, it's not you.

129
00:10:08,934 --> 00:10:10,502
Okay.

130
00:10:16,093 --> 00:10:18,753
I was worried
someone could see me.

131
00:10:20,910 --> 00:10:23,470
I'm only an
hour and a half away,

132
00:10:23,490 --> 00:10:27,240
I can come down this
weekend... or something?

133
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:28,995
I mean, if you want, I--

134
00:10:29,015 --> 00:10:30,730
Yeah, I'll be there.

135
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:33,790
You know, it's hard
to hear you like this

136
00:10:33,810 --> 00:10:36,626
when we're not living
together anymore, and I...

137
00:10:36,646 --> 00:10:37,439
I can't--

138
00:10:37,459 --> 00:10:39,099
Why don't we talk
about it later, okay?

139
00:10:40,350 --> 00:10:42,200
We can talk about that later.

140
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:45,870
Well I mean, it's like
what mom says, right?

141
00:10:45,890 --> 00:10:47,523
Focus on what you can control.

142
00:10:48,990 --> 00:10:51,423
So... what are you
gonna do tonight?

143
00:10:53,940 --> 00:10:54,940
Wallpaper.

144
00:10:55,950 --> 00:10:57,200
That sounds good.

145
00:10:58,110 --> 00:10:59,121
Then what?

146
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,903
Julia, you there?

147
00:11:13,710 --> 00:11:14,710
Hello?

148
00:11:19,170 --> 00:11:21,393
Julia, are you still there?

149
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:25,683
Are you okay?

150
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:31,571
You know what, actually, I...

151
00:11:32,446 --> 00:11:33,912
I need to let you go, okay?

152
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:37,710
Have a good night, I love you.

153
00:11:37,730 --> 00:11:40,024
Okay, I love you.

154
00:11:40,044 --> 00:11:40,857
Are you--

155
00:11:57,930 --> 00:12:01,060
Our surveillance on this
street is pretty touch and go,

156
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:02,101
but I'll let you
know if we find any--

157
00:13:45,036 --> 00:13:46,712
Hey, um...

158
00:13:46,732 --> 00:13:48,412
Let me know if you
change your mind, okay?

159
00:13:49,380 --> 00:13:51,400
I don't have to come,

160
00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:54,117
but I want you to
know I'm here for you,

161
00:13:54,137 --> 00:13:55,700
you don't have to do this alone.

162
00:14:00,450 --> 00:14:02,050
I'm proud you're taking control.

163
00:14:03,180 --> 00:14:04,178
Talk soon.

164
00:14:04,198 --> 00:14:05,196
I love you.

165
00:15:52,328 --> 00:15:53,328
TAT?

166
00:15:55,214 --> 00:15:56,214
TAT!?

167
00:15:56,996 --> 00:15:58,530
My God.

168
00:15:58,550 --> 00:16:00,064
No, no, no!

169
00:16:00,084 --> 00:16:02,801
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

170
00:16:02,821 --> 00:16:03,746
God...

171
00:16:03,766 --> 00:16:04,635
Hey...

172
00:16:04,655 --> 00:16:05,504
God...

173
00:16:05,524 --> 00:16:07,182
Let me know if you
change your mind, okay?

174
00:16:07,202 --> 00:16:09,130
I don't have to come,

175
00:16:09,150 --> 00:16:11,615
but I want you to
know I'm here for you.

176
00:16:11,635 --> 00:16:14,100
you know, you don't
have to do this alone.

177
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:14,933
I just...

178
00:16:16,749 --> 00:16:18,340
...I'm proud you're
taking control.

179
00:16:19,230 --> 00:16:20,766
Talk soon.

180
00:16:23,970 --> 00:16:25,470
Let me know if you
change your mind, okay?

181
00:16:26,303 --> 00:16:27,880
I don't have to come...

182
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:29,900
but I want you to
know I'm here for you,

183
00:16:30,930 --> 00:16:34,223
you know, don't
have to do this alone...

184
00:16:34,243 --> 00:16:35,434
I'm proud you're taking control.

185
00:16:35,454 --> 00:16:37,271
We have a
new member joining our program

186
00:16:37,291 --> 00:16:39,108
I know she just moved
into her new place...

187
00:16:39,128 --> 00:16:40,157
I just
went through your account--

188
00:16:40,177 --> 00:16:41,658
God, grant me the serenity

189
00:16:41,678 --> 00:16:43,425
to accept the things
I cannot change-

190
00:16:47,216 --> 00:16:48,029
Please, continue to hold

191
00:16:48,049 --> 00:16:49,355
and we will be with you shorty.

192
00:16:49,375 --> 00:16:50,682
How are you settling in, Julia?

193
00:16:51,330 --> 00:16:52,630
Unfortunately,

194
00:16:52,650 --> 00:16:54,530
I can't share any details
about other accounts,

195
00:16:54,550 --> 00:16:56,410
but I'm looking at your
information right now,

196
00:16:56,430 --> 00:16:58,980
and I can assure you your
account has not been compromised.

197
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,930
God, grant me the serenity...

198
00:17:05,243 --> 00:17:07,707
And the wisdom to
know the difference.

199
00:17:07,727 --> 00:17:09,932
How are
you settling in, Julia?

200
00:17:09,952 --> 00:17:10,750
I did not order...

201
00:17:10,770 --> 00:17:12,513
God, grant me the serenity-

202
00:17:12,533 --> 00:17:14,256
I don't have to come,

203
00:17:14,276 --> 00:17:15,667
but I want you to
know I'm here for you,

204
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,505
you know, you don't
have to do this alone.

205
00:17:19,338 --> 00:17:21,156
I'm proud you're taking control.

206
00:17:21,176 --> 00:17:22,994
I'm proud you're taking control.

207
00:17:24,152 --> 00:17:25,195
I'm proud you're taking control.

208
00:17:26,028 --> 00:17:27,028
Talk soon.
