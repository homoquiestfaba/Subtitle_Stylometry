1
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:04,168
Why Emmet Ray?
Because he was interesting.

2
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:06,794
To me, Emmet Ray was
a fascinating character.

3
00:02:06,865 --> 00:02:09,319
I was a huge fan of his
when I was younger.

4
00:02:09,392 --> 00:02:12,240
I thought he was
an absolutely great guitar player...

5
00:02:12,306 --> 00:02:14,161
and he was funny.

6
00:02:14,226 --> 00:02:16,081
You know, or...

7
00:02:16,147 --> 00:02:19,081
if funny's the wrong word,
then sort of pathetic in a way.

8
00:02:19,154 --> 00:02:22,667
He was flamboyant
and he was, you know...

9
00:02:22,738 --> 00:02:24,877
boorish and obnoxious.

10
00:02:24,947 --> 00:02:28,297
Well, the problem is that there's
just so little known about him.

11
00:02:28,372 --> 00:02:31,406
But we do know that
he was a great guitar player.

12
00:02:31,476 --> 00:02:35,666
I'd say he was probably the second
greatest guitar player in the world.

13
00:02:35,732 --> 00:02:37,587
Django Reinhardt was the best...

14
00:02:37,653 --> 00:02:40,239
and believe me,
Emmet idolized Django.

15
00:02:40,310 --> 00:02:41,969
He was in awe of him.

16
00:02:42,038 --> 00:02:46,315
There's a story that says when he
saw him playing in France, he fainted.

17
00:02:46,390 --> 00:02:51,628
He saw Django again at a restaurant
in Germany, and he fainted again.

18
00:02:51,703 --> 00:02:53,296
It seems that every time...

19
00:02:53,367 --> 00:02:56,367
Django would always make him faint
or he'd make him cry.

20
00:02:57,080 --> 00:03:00,495
Well, his relationship with Hattie
is mostly what's known about him.

21
00:03:00,568 --> 00:03:03,416
There are a few Emmet Ray
stories before that...

22
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:06,263
but I have no idea whether
they're true or not.

23
00:03:06,329 --> 00:03:09,014
First time anybody seemed
to have heard of him was in Chicago.

24
00:03:09,082 --> 00:03:11,253
It was at this roadside joint.

25
00:03:15,227 --> 00:03:17,332
Good to see you tonight.

26
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:22,290
- Where the hell is he?
- I don't know.

27
00:03:22,364 --> 00:03:24,819
You gotta get him, Dan.
He's layin' drunk somewhere.

28
00:03:24,892 --> 00:03:27,925
- He's probably in a poolroom.
- Every night it's somethin' else.

29
00:03:27,996 --> 00:03:30,899
He's late. He gets drunk.
He falls off the bandstand.

30
00:03:30,972 --> 00:03:33,940
- I told you not to hire this guy.
- What time does Emmet Ray go on?

31
00:03:34,013 --> 00:03:36,469
Look at the crowd.
Think they're here to see me?

32
00:03:36,542 --> 00:03:38,167
Relax. I'll find him.

33
00:03:38,237 --> 00:03:40,507
I'm gonna have to
hold the show again.

34
00:03:40,574 --> 00:03:43,062
I'll kill this guy.
I don't care what kind of artist he is.

35
00:03:43,134 --> 00:03:46,234
You take care of business.
I'll find him. Just relax.

36
00:03:47,264 --> 00:03:49,370
Hey, good to see you again.

37
00:03:52,416 --> 00:03:53,943
That's 50 more you owe me.

38
00:03:54,016 --> 00:03:57,530
I'm not goin' out of town.
Another one?

39
00:04:00,226 --> 00:04:02,330
I think you got some visitors.

40
00:04:04,225 --> 00:04:05,916
I'll be back.

41
00:04:09,634 --> 00:04:11,969
- What'd we get?
- Here's your end.

42
00:04:17,315 --> 00:04:20,699
This is what you bring me, $30?
It's almost midnight. $30?

43
00:04:20,773 --> 00:04:22,628
That's half, Emmet.
That's all we made.

44
00:04:22,693 --> 00:04:25,694
I can't live on that.
I got car payments, I got new shirts.

45
00:04:25,766 --> 00:04:28,700
I'm sorry. Business was slow.
It's a Jewish holiday.

46
00:04:28,773 --> 00:04:32,636
And last night it was rainin', and
the night before you got food poisonin'.

47
00:04:32,710 --> 00:04:35,645
- Because I drank that booze you made.
- Listen, Emmet.

48
00:04:35,719 --> 00:04:38,915
I don't know how to tell you this,
but while I was in bed...

49
00:04:38,983 --> 00:04:44,133
with one of the johns you sent me,
he got very excited, and he...

50
00:04:44,199 --> 00:04:47,299
got a heart attack,
and he dropped dead.

51
00:04:48,713 --> 00:04:51,615
- Which one?
- The salesman from Detroit.

52
00:04:51,689 --> 00:04:55,202
- What did you do?
- I took my clothes and I left.

53
00:04:55,273 --> 00:04:57,695
So there's nothin'
to trace back to us?

54
00:04:57,769 --> 00:05:01,796
Then I was thinking that maybe
he had one of your business cards.

55
00:05:02,826 --> 00:05:05,861
- Oh, my God.
- A pimp doesn't need business cards!

56
00:05:05,932 --> 00:05:07,786
You're always tryin'
to be too fancy.

57
00:05:07,851 --> 00:05:10,698
Emmet, let's go.
You're supposed to be on stage.

58
00:05:10,763 --> 00:05:13,862
Every night you're either late,
drunk, or you don't show up.

59
00:05:13,932 --> 00:05:16,071
What is it with you?

60
00:05:27,182 --> 00:05:30,379
How are you doin'?
I'm on right now.

61
00:05:30,447 --> 00:05:32,934
Thanks for comin'.
Put their tab on my bill.

62
00:05:34,191 --> 00:05:37,388
I don't wanna embarrass you in front of
friends, but boss said no more advances.

63
00:05:37,456 --> 00:05:40,522
Don't give me a song and dance.
Just put their tab on my bill.

64
00:05:40,592 --> 00:05:42,251
Hi, guys.

65
00:08:01,829 --> 00:08:05,310
It's gonna be a lot of cats there.
We always have fun at Don's.

66
00:08:05,382 --> 00:08:07,388
- Donald.
- Well, Donald.

67
00:08:07,461 --> 00:08:09,316
- Watch out over there.
- I got this, man.

68
00:08:09,382 --> 00:08:11,717
You take care of that.
And don't forget to pass.

69
00:08:11,782 --> 00:08:14,782
- They caught him a couple of times.
- Caught what?

70
00:08:14,854 --> 00:08:17,538
Mind your business.
Watch the road.

71
00:08:17,608 --> 00:08:19,844
What you got there, man?
Is that a.45?

72
00:08:19,911 --> 00:08:22,213
.45 what?
Wait, wait.

73
00:08:23,464 --> 00:08:25,407
Better put that shit away.

74
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:28,864
Hey, you wanna go to the dump,
shoot some rats? Huh?

75
00:08:28,938 --> 00:08:31,109
- Shoot some what?
- Rats.

76
00:08:31,178 --> 00:08:33,927
I do it all the time.
It's a lot of fun.

77
00:08:33,994 --> 00:08:37,736
- A hepcat shootin' rats.
- I don't think you need no more of this.

78
00:08:37,801 --> 00:08:42,309
There should be no other guns
in this car besides my gun.

79
00:08:58,861 --> 00:09:01,196
Man, where'd you learn
to play that thing like that?

80
00:09:01,262 --> 00:09:05,005
- I never heard guitar sound so good.
- Yeah, I'm the greatest in the world.

81
00:09:05,071 --> 00:09:07,460
Well, you know,
in France there's Django.

82
00:09:07,535 --> 00:09:11,397
Django? You know, he's comin'
to America in the summer to record.

83
00:09:11,471 --> 00:09:14,570
- Yeah?
- Yeah. Ever meet him?

84
00:09:14,639 --> 00:09:17,061
I could've once, in Europe.

85
00:09:17,136 --> 00:09:19,787
You know, really,
our styles are just different.

86
00:09:19,856 --> 00:09:23,304
Nate Drummond prefers me.
He says I'm miraculous.

87
00:09:23,376 --> 00:09:27,174
You're welcome to come here anytime.
You know, we play here all the time.

88
00:09:27,249 --> 00:09:29,934
- And I make great chili.
- Well, thank you.

89
00:09:47,348 --> 00:09:50,065
Say, man, we're about to hit it.
Can we drop you somewhere?

90
00:09:50,132 --> 00:09:52,402
- I like the air. I'll walk.
- You sure about that?

91
00:09:52,469 --> 00:09:54,324
Yeah. Thank you.

92
00:10:21,817 --> 00:10:24,600
Well, I heard stories
that he was a kleptomaniac.

93
00:10:24,666 --> 00:10:28,441
I heard that once he stole
an alarm clock from Hoagy Carmichael...

94
00:10:28,506 --> 00:10:31,190
and Hoagy overslept
and he missed a record date.

95
00:10:31,258 --> 00:10:32,786
What do you think?

96
00:10:32,859 --> 00:10:37,170
The only other story that I heard,
other than Hattie, was this moon idea.

97
00:10:37,244 --> 00:10:40,593
He had this idea
about this crescent moon.

98
00:10:40,668 --> 00:10:43,603
That he wanted to make an entrance
on this big crescent moon.

99
00:10:43,676 --> 00:10:46,906
Well, the story is that
it came to him, apparently...

100
00:10:46,973 --> 00:10:49,079
I guess, in a dream...

101
00:10:49,150 --> 00:10:51,540
that he'd build this moon thing
with his own money.

102
00:10:51,614 --> 00:10:54,200
Because he thought that
a star of his great stature...

103
00:10:54,271 --> 00:10:57,948
ought to be able to make
a real big entrance with a moon.

104
00:10:58,015 --> 00:10:59,083
Just try to visualize it.

105
00:10:59,084 --> 00:11:00,151
Just try to visualize it.

106
00:11:00,223 --> 00:11:03,290
You're lookin' up, and there it is.
Gold, beautiful moon.

107
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:06,491
I'm comin' down, and you guys
are playin'. What do you think?

108
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:09,594
It's a stupid idea. I told you.
Would you let me take this shot?

109
00:11:09,664 --> 00:11:13,048
I didn't ask your opinion.
I'm just tellin' you how it's gonna go.

110
00:11:22,786 --> 00:11:25,787
And then the jacket
would match the moon...

111
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:28,860
against a black
velvet background.

112
00:11:28,932 --> 00:11:32,030
- What do you think?
- It sounds okay to me.

113
00:11:32,099 --> 00:11:34,172
- Yeah.
- It's fancy.

114
00:11:35,588 --> 00:11:38,207
I'm considered
the best guitar player...

115
00:11:38,277 --> 00:11:40,165
maybe that ever lived.

116
00:11:41,670 --> 00:11:44,004
Certainly in this country.
There's this...

117
00:11:44,069 --> 00:11:46,458
There's a gypsy in France...

118
00:11:46,533 --> 00:11:49,850
and he's the most
beautiful thing I ever heard.

119
00:11:51,815 --> 00:11:53,342
Tonight's the night.

120
00:11:53,415 --> 00:11:56,993
Emmet, just as long as you're happy.
That's the most important thing.

121
00:11:57,063 --> 00:11:58,590
It's really beautiful.

122
00:11:58,663 --> 00:12:01,347
It is really beautiful.
It's like jewelry.

123
00:12:03,049 --> 00:12:06,726
Hey, I wanna just be alone with
the moon for a minute, all right?

124
00:12:06,793 --> 00:12:09,640
You wanna be alone
with the moon? Okay.

125
00:12:09,705 --> 00:12:12,520
Emmet, you know what you are?
You're a genius.

126
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:29,803
She's a knockout, ain't she?

127
00:12:29,869 --> 00:12:31,527
Hope it's safe.

128
00:12:32,493 --> 00:12:35,493
Of course it's safe.
Why wouldn't it be safe?

129
00:12:35,565 --> 00:12:39,656
It's a hell of a drop.
A man can break his neck.

130
00:12:40,494 --> 00:12:42,250
Really?

131
00:12:42,318 --> 00:12:46,181
And it starts to build and build
in Emmet's mind.

132
00:12:46,255 --> 00:12:48,589
And by show time...

133
00:12:48,654 --> 00:12:51,786
he's numb with fear,
he's petrified.

134
00:12:51,855 --> 00:12:54,671
And the audience is out there
waiting for him...

135
00:12:54,736 --> 00:12:57,868
and he's backstage, meanwhile,
drinking and drinking.

136
00:12:57,937 --> 00:13:01,418
When he's ready to go on,
he's stiff as a board.

137
00:13:04,273 --> 00:13:06,608
- Snazzy!
- Did you buy that off the rack?

138
00:13:08,275 --> 00:13:10,130
Look. The Big Dipper.

139
00:13:10,195 --> 00:13:13,991
- Emmet, your gun is bulging.
- Do you think?

140
00:13:14,066 --> 00:13:16,008
What the hell you
need it on stage for?

141
00:13:16,082 --> 00:13:17,992
I don't feel right
without it.

142
00:13:18,067 --> 00:13:20,402
I'll give it back to you
as soon as you're done.

143
00:13:20,468 --> 00:13:22,443
Show time!

144
00:13:38,903 --> 00:13:41,325
- You all right?
- Emmet, be careful.

145
00:13:47,896 --> 00:13:49,106
You're on?

146
00:13:50,137 --> 00:13:52,078
Need a hand?

147
00:13:52,152 --> 00:13:53,811
Let's do it.

148
00:14:51,426 --> 00:14:55,617
Sooner or later,
everybody's dreams go up in smoke.

149
00:14:56,321 --> 00:14:58,460
What about my dreams?

150
00:14:58,529 --> 00:15:00,701
I can't settle down, Ann.

151
00:15:00,770 --> 00:15:03,226
- We don't have to marry.
- I can't.

152
00:15:03,299 --> 00:15:06,300
I gotta be free.
I'm an artist.

153
00:15:06,372 --> 00:15:08,543
I thought you liked me.

154
00:15:09,860 --> 00:15:11,715
We have fun.

155
00:15:11,780 --> 00:15:15,610
I took you to the dump.
I let you shoot my gun at some rats.

156
00:15:15,685 --> 00:15:18,948
Shootin' rats at the dump
is not my idea of a good time.

157
00:15:19,014 --> 00:15:21,251
Why not?
We brought sandwiches.

158
00:15:21,318 --> 00:15:24,864
And sittin' at the railroads watchin'
trains, that's pretty strange too.

159
00:15:24,935 --> 00:15:28,514
See? That's what I mean.

160
00:15:28,583 --> 00:15:32,380
What I like to do, what you like to do,
ain't the same thing.

161
00:15:32,455 --> 00:15:34,179
That's not it, Emmet.

162
00:15:34,247 --> 00:15:36,254
It's that you keep
your feelings locked up...

163
00:15:36,327 --> 00:15:39,045
and you can't feel nothin'
for anybody else.

164
00:15:39,112 --> 00:15:41,185
You say that
like it's a bad thing.

165
00:15:41,257 --> 00:15:45,765
Some terrible things happen
to people in love. I know. I've seen it.

166
00:15:45,834 --> 00:15:48,997
I enjoy the company of women.
I love 'em.

167
00:15:49,065 --> 00:15:52,295
It's just that
I don't need 'em.

168
00:15:52,362 --> 00:15:56,138
I guess, you know, that's the way it is
when you're a true artist.

169
00:15:58,764 --> 00:16:01,065
It doesn't mean
we can't fool around.

170
00:16:01,131 --> 00:16:04,678
Oh, right.
Or shoot rats or watch trains.

171
00:16:04,749 --> 00:16:08,775
I never met anybody that
keeps their feelings so locked up.

172
00:16:08,845 --> 00:16:11,529
I let my feelin's
come out in my music.

173
00:16:11,597 --> 00:16:15,820
Maybe if you let your feelings out in
real life, your music would be better.

174
00:16:15,885 --> 00:16:17,478
Don't talk.

175
00:16:21,231 --> 00:16:23,752
Emmet met Hattie in New Jersey.

176
00:16:23,823 --> 00:16:26,725
The band was playing a resort hotel.

177
00:16:26,799 --> 00:16:29,418
On a day off, Emmet...

178
00:16:29,488 --> 00:16:33,067
and his drummer,
Bill Shields...

179
00:16:33,137 --> 00:16:35,526
were doing their
version of charm.

180
00:16:35,601 --> 00:16:38,536
They were trying to pick up girls
on the boardwalk.

181
00:16:41,809 --> 00:16:44,427
This place is heaven on earth.
Cotton candy, eight o'clock.

182
00:16:44,497 --> 00:16:46,025
Watch me work.

183
00:16:46,930 --> 00:16:49,320
Mary! Right?

184
00:16:49,395 --> 00:16:51,729
Why don't you drop dead, jerk?

185
00:16:51,795 --> 00:16:55,505
I thought you were someone I knew.
Sometimes I hit with a... Mary!

186
00:16:55,571 --> 00:16:57,230
Martina. Mary Ann.

187
00:16:57,300 --> 00:16:59,123
Marge. Kate?

188
00:16:59,188 --> 00:17:02,287
Excuse me, miss.
I'm a photography buff myself.

189
00:17:02,357 --> 00:17:05,324
I was thinkin' maybe we could
get my friend to take a picture of us.

190
00:17:05,397 --> 00:17:07,253
Wait a minute. Time out.

191
00:17:07,318 --> 00:17:09,490
- Do you see this?
- Oh, yeah.

192
00:17:09,558 --> 00:17:12,308
Did you see? She looked
right at me. She smiled.

193
00:17:12,375 --> 00:17:15,342
- That was a smile.
- And she was lookin' right at me.

194
00:17:15,414 --> 00:17:16,821
Which one you want?

195
00:17:16,887 --> 00:17:18,642
The little one
with the silly hat.

196
00:17:18,710 --> 00:17:20,565
She's more my size.
I'll flip you.

197
00:17:20,631 --> 00:17:22,736
- I saw her first!
- All right!

198
00:17:22,807 --> 00:17:25,175
You want the little one?
Take the little one.

199
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:27,183
I'll take the redhead.
What difference does it make?

200
00:17:27,256 --> 00:17:30,552
They're gettin' away. There's
nothin' wrong with the little one.

201
00:17:30,617 --> 00:17:33,367
The redhead's got
nice legs and a nice chest.

202
00:17:33,433 --> 00:17:35,474
- I'll take the redhead.
- The little one is cute.

203
00:17:35,546 --> 00:17:39,343
She has a nice face and those Cupid-bow
lips I like, but I'll take the redhead.

204
00:17:39,418 --> 00:17:41,012
- You wanted the little one.
- I changed my mind.

205
00:17:41,083 --> 00:17:42,609
I'll flip you.

206
00:17:44,731 --> 00:17:46,324
- Call.
- Tails.

207
00:17:49,564 --> 00:17:51,703
- I got the little one.
- We agree.

208
00:17:51,772 --> 00:17:54,074
- Now they gotta agree.
- Come on.

209
00:17:55,516 --> 00:17:58,451
I'm telling you, you're gonna
get on the Ferris wheel this time.

210
00:17:58,524 --> 00:18:02,170
Remember when you tried to go on?
Last year we tried to get you up there.

211
00:18:02,238 --> 00:18:04,093
- Excuse me.
- You were scared.

212
00:18:04,158 --> 00:18:07,323
Hi. You ladies from around here?

213
00:18:07,391 --> 00:18:09,463
Yeah, we work right near here.

214
00:18:09,534 --> 00:18:12,120
I'm Billy Shields.
I'm a musician.

215
00:18:12,191 --> 00:18:15,061
He's with my quintet.
I'm Emmet Ray.

216
00:18:15,136 --> 00:18:17,471
The Emmet Ray Hot Quintet.
We're at the Lakeside Ballroom.

217
00:18:17,536 --> 00:18:21,398
It's our day off, so we were thinking
maybe you could show us the sights.

218
00:18:21,472 --> 00:18:24,287
- You wanna go watch some trains?
- What?

219
00:18:24,352 --> 00:18:27,255
He's kidding.
Let's go for a drink.

220
00:18:28,705 --> 00:18:31,357
Ask him. I liked you instantly.
I'm bein' honest.

221
00:18:31,426 --> 00:18:33,499
We flipped, he won, I got you.

222
00:18:33,571 --> 00:18:35,807
I'm Gracie MacRae.

223
00:18:35,874 --> 00:18:37,248
Billy Shields.

224
00:18:37,315 --> 00:18:41,244
And if I may say, you have the most
beautiful blue eyes I've ever seen.

225
00:18:41,315 --> 00:18:43,585
This is my friend Hattie.

226
00:18:43,652 --> 00:18:45,757
Hattie, I'm Emmet Ray.

227
00:18:45,828 --> 00:18:49,057
I've got the quintet.
You like jazz music, baby?

228
00:18:49,124 --> 00:18:51,808
How about we take
a boat ride, huh?

229
00:18:51,877 --> 00:18:54,430
Well, sure.
We'd love to.

230
00:18:54,502 --> 00:18:56,924
- We'll ride around the lake.
- Great.

231
00:18:56,998 --> 00:18:59,812
What's your name?
Don't be shy, darlin'.

232
00:18:59,877 --> 00:19:02,845
Hattie don't talk.
She's mute.

233
00:19:04,903 --> 00:19:06,758
Wanna go take a boat ride?

234
00:19:26,858 --> 00:19:29,193
Don't overthrow it.
Throw it down.

235
00:19:34,923 --> 00:19:37,258
That was a good try.
Try it one more time.

236
00:19:38,539 --> 00:19:40,579
That was all right.
Good try.

237
00:19:40,651 --> 00:19:42,506
Thanks for stickin' me
with the dummy.

238
00:19:42,572 --> 00:19:46,347
- Stop whining. You wanted her.
- Then I changed my mind.

239
00:19:46,413 --> 00:19:48,039
She seems like a nice girl.

240
00:19:48,110 --> 00:19:50,477
How could she seem like anything?
She doesn't talk.

241
00:19:50,542 --> 00:19:53,324
This is my one day off.
I want a talkin' girl.

242
00:19:53,390 --> 00:19:56,871
- I think she's a bit of a half-wit.
- What do you mean?

243
00:19:56,943 --> 00:19:59,115
Gracie says
she's not all there in the head.

244
00:19:59,184 --> 00:20:00,842
Well, that's great.

245
00:20:00,911 --> 00:20:03,628
A man like me, got ideas.

246
00:20:03,695 --> 00:20:05,768
Try to have
a good time today, huh?

247
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:08,360
You girls wanna
go for a walk on the pier?

248
00:20:11,857 --> 00:20:13,767
You hungry?

249
00:20:15,409 --> 00:20:17,645
Is that a yes or a no?

250
00:20:17,713 --> 00:20:19,568
Yeah, me too.

251
00:20:22,706 --> 00:20:24,561
What? Huh?

252
00:20:31,412 --> 00:20:34,958
I can't read that. It's like a Chinaman.
What do you want?

253
00:20:36,597 --> 00:20:39,893
Do you know how to write?
Did you go to school?

254
00:20:42,132 --> 00:20:45,745
What is that?
Is that a yes or a no?

255
00:20:47,926 --> 00:20:50,960
You're a hard-luck case.
You an orphan?

256
00:20:52,087 --> 00:20:53,648
You don't know?

257
00:20:53,719 --> 00:20:55,857
Oh, this is great.
This is great.

258
00:20:55,927 --> 00:20:58,742
I get a goddamn mute
orphan half-wit.

259
00:20:58,808 --> 00:21:01,940
I get all the winners. Were you
always like this, born like this?

260
00:21:02,008 --> 00:21:04,245
Or did somebody drop you
on your head, or what?

261
00:21:04,313 --> 00:21:07,793
Gracie's hungry.
Let's go get some clams or somethin'.

262
00:21:07,864 --> 00:21:09,523
Can we switch for a while?

263
00:21:09,593 --> 00:21:12,147
No. What's the matter with you?

264
00:21:14,586 --> 00:21:17,368
I was amazing the second
I picked up the instrument.

265
00:21:17,434 --> 00:21:21,231
It's just in me someplace,
like a gift of God.

266
00:21:22,490 --> 00:21:25,491
They said I'd have been great,
whatever instrument I chose.

267
00:21:25,563 --> 00:21:28,313
But on guitar,
nobody can touch me.

268
00:21:29,693 --> 00:21:31,701
Except this gypsy in France.

269
00:21:31,772 --> 00:21:35,449
But mostly, I'm untouchable.
They want me to record.

270
00:21:35,517 --> 00:21:38,365
They do, but I don't know.

271
00:21:38,430 --> 00:21:41,431
Once you record,
everybody can copy your stuff.

272
00:21:41,502 --> 00:21:43,358
They steal your ideas.

273
00:21:43,423 --> 00:21:47,416
Why do I wanna make something beautiful
just to have some jerk copy it?

274
00:21:50,718 --> 00:21:53,948
You wanna come hear
the show sometime? My guest?

275
00:21:54,015 --> 00:21:55,871
- Both of you.
- Yeah.

276
00:21:56,896 --> 00:21:58,935
You'd appreciate it. You would.

277
00:21:59,007 --> 00:22:02,870
You'll see.
I possess a great talent.

278
00:22:02,944 --> 00:22:06,393
You might be mute,
but you're not deaf, right?

279
00:22:06,466 --> 00:22:09,019
And you don't have to be bright.
Music's for everybody.

280
00:22:09,090 --> 00:22:11,098
The smart or the dumb.

281
00:22:14,755 --> 00:22:17,952
- How'd you lose your voice?
- She don't know.

282
00:22:18,019 --> 00:22:20,703
It was somethin' when she
was a kid, like a high fever.

283
00:22:20,773 --> 00:22:22,628
She doesn't remember.

284
00:22:23,908 --> 00:22:27,204
- Is she...
- Yeah, but she's a good laundress.

285
00:22:32,454 --> 00:22:35,237
I've shot guys.
That's right.

286
00:22:35,302 --> 00:22:38,749
Well, I had to.
You know, it was them or me.

287
00:22:38,822 --> 00:22:41,190
I could tell you stories.

288
00:22:41,254 --> 00:22:44,004
What do you say we go
to the dump, shoot some rats?

289
00:22:44,072 --> 00:22:45,599
What?

290
00:22:45,672 --> 00:22:47,745
Yeah, it'll be a ball.

291
00:22:47,817 --> 00:22:49,857
Emmet, please.
Not now, huh?

292
00:22:49,928 --> 00:22:53,704
Well, it's my car, and I say we're
stoppin' at the dump for ten minutes.

293
00:22:57,418 --> 00:22:59,719
- Uh, squeeze.
- You call this fun?

294
00:22:59,786 --> 00:23:02,656
Don't jerk. Just squeeze.
Line it up to your sights.

295
00:23:02,729 --> 00:23:05,347
He's gonna get away.
Line it up in the sights.

296
00:23:05,417 --> 00:23:07,523
- Come on! It's cold!
- In a minute.

297
00:23:07,594 --> 00:23:10,944
- Just do what I'm tellin' you to do!
- Leave her alone already!

298
00:23:11,019 --> 00:23:12,874
There's nothin' to it.

299
00:23:17,196 --> 00:23:19,171
Did you see that?
I got him!

300
00:23:19,245 --> 00:23:21,612
- You call this civil?
- What are you doin'?

301
00:23:21,676 --> 00:23:24,939
- No more cheese for this little fella.
- No, don't pick it up.

302
00:23:25,006 --> 00:23:27,308
These guys are diseased.
You gotta put it down.

303
00:23:27,374 --> 00:23:30,058
Did you know that rats
attack poor kids in their cribs?

304
00:23:30,126 --> 00:23:33,442
- I thought you'd enjoy this.
- Are you crazy?

305
00:23:33,518 --> 00:23:35,176
So, what do you think?

306
00:23:35,246 --> 00:23:38,509
- You wanna come up to my room...
- Do you think we could go out...

307
00:23:38,575 --> 00:23:41,063
- hear me play my guitar?
- Alone sometime?

308
00:23:42,127 --> 00:23:44,299
Good. Come on.

309
00:23:49,009 --> 00:23:50,603
Come on in.

310
00:23:56,082 --> 00:23:58,471
That's my guitar.

311
00:23:58,546 --> 00:24:00,783
I'll play it for you soon.

312
00:24:00,851 --> 00:24:02,706
Like a drink?

313
00:24:05,620 --> 00:24:07,626
You know...

314
00:24:07,699 --> 00:24:10,514
I know we don't
know each other...

315
00:24:10,580 --> 00:24:12,969
and we just met, but...

316
00:24:14,004 --> 00:24:16,754
I had a wonderful evening.

317
00:24:16,821 --> 00:24:19,505
I don't need a genius
to have a good time.

318
00:24:21,973 --> 00:24:25,105
You know, I'm a fast worker.

319
00:24:31,831 --> 00:24:34,165
You're not puttin' up
much resistance.

320
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:38,615
Lot of girls do...

321
00:24:38,681 --> 00:24:40,536
on a first date.

322
00:24:44,441 --> 00:24:46,612
Hold on. Hold it.
Time out.

323
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:49,616
Just I'm gettin'
a little razzled with your pace.

324
00:24:52,122 --> 00:24:53,977
You like me?

325
00:24:57,275 --> 00:24:59,446
Just expected more of a fight.

326
00:25:01,147 --> 00:25:04,596
This is... It's like
shootin' fish in a barrel.

327
00:25:18,621 --> 00:25:20,531
Did you like that?

328
00:25:20,606 --> 00:25:22,461
I knew you would.

329
00:25:23,966 --> 00:25:26,138
They say I'm a wonderful lover.

330
00:25:27,423 --> 00:25:29,758
You got a terrific body.
You really do.

331
00:25:29,824 --> 00:25:32,759
Round. I like round.
And I don't mean fat.

332
00:25:32,832 --> 00:25:34,905
You got some heft.

333
00:25:34,977 --> 00:25:38,425
Makes a fella feel like
he's been someplace.

334
00:25:39,745 --> 00:25:42,200
Now get dressed.

335
00:25:42,273 --> 00:25:45,176
I'm tired.
I gotta go to sleep.

336
00:25:45,250 --> 00:25:47,585
If I don't get my sleep,
I'm cranky.

337
00:25:48,932 --> 00:25:53,208
I'd give you cab fare, but I
don't assume it's a long walk home.

338
00:25:55,875 --> 00:25:58,112
First time I had sex,
seven years old.

339
00:25:58,179 --> 00:26:00,733
The guitar. Right.

340
00:26:00,805 --> 00:26:03,106
Well, that's why
we came up here.

341
00:26:04,132 --> 00:26:06,304
All right, you get dressed.

342
00:26:06,372 --> 00:26:09,504
I'm exhausted.
What's your favorite song?

343
00:26:09,574 --> 00:26:11,843
Oh, look who I'm askin'.

344
00:28:41,660 --> 00:28:43,514
I lived in Detroit...

345
00:28:43,579 --> 00:28:45,587
and Canada...

346
00:28:45,660 --> 00:28:47,515
and New York...

347
00:28:48,796 --> 00:28:50,487
St. Louis.

348
00:28:51,773 --> 00:28:54,523
My father was in the army.

349
00:28:54,590 --> 00:28:56,598
I never got along with him.

350
00:28:57,694 --> 00:28:59,800
He used to hit me with a belt.

351
00:29:01,790 --> 00:29:03,416
He's dead now.

352
00:29:04,863 --> 00:29:07,165
Got asphyxiated.

353
00:29:11,585 --> 00:29:14,748
I'm pretty sure
my mother's dead too.

354
00:29:14,817 --> 00:29:16,824
She used to get spells.

355
00:29:18,081 --> 00:29:21,464
I don't know if her family
put her away somewhere...

356
00:29:23,746 --> 00:29:26,333
or if she's dead.

357
00:29:26,403 --> 00:29:28,955
She used to foam at the mouth.

358
00:29:33,892 --> 00:29:36,576
She sang beautifully.

359
00:29:36,644 --> 00:29:39,066
The most beautiful music
I ever heard.

360
00:29:43,397 --> 00:29:45,307
Except for this...

361
00:29:45,381 --> 00:29:47,870
gypsy guitar player in France.

362
00:29:49,830 --> 00:29:52,644
Can you believe I can't
listen to him without cryin'?

363
00:30:39,309 --> 00:30:41,164
Give us a shot, would you?

364
00:30:49,391 --> 00:30:52,654
So I'm gonna be busy later.
Somethin' came up.

365
00:30:54,832 --> 00:30:57,253
You just go get yourself
home by yourself.

366
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:04,169
Now wait.
What was that look for?

367
00:31:04,241 --> 00:31:06,096
What did I do?

368
00:31:09,393 --> 00:31:11,248
I got business.

369
00:31:14,226 --> 00:31:16,714
We gotta spend
every minute together?

370
00:31:21,268 --> 00:31:22,696
Look.

371
00:31:23,731 --> 00:31:26,318
You go get yourself a cab...

372
00:31:26,389 --> 00:31:28,244
and I'll see you tomorrow.

373
00:32:34,783 --> 00:32:36,638
Where the hell am I?

374
00:32:44,031 --> 00:32:45,886
Stroudsburg, Pennsylvania?

375
00:32:47,168 --> 00:32:51,227
I take one puff in New Jersey,
I end up in Stroudsburg, Pennsylvania?

376
00:32:51,297 --> 00:32:53,151
I gotta get a cab.

377
00:32:59,618 --> 00:33:02,619
I need a taxi!
Can I get a cab?

378
00:33:04,259 --> 00:33:06,942
I'm sorry, Emmet.
I had no choice.

379
00:33:07,011 --> 00:33:10,328
- We got a contract.
- Look, I run a first- class hotel here.

380
00:33:10,404 --> 00:33:12,477
- This was an emergency.
- Yeah, an emergency.

381
00:33:12,548 --> 00:33:14,589
What kind of emergency?

382
00:33:14,661 --> 00:33:16,516
- My father died.
- Again?

383
00:33:16,581 --> 00:33:18,467
How many times
can your father pass away?

384
00:33:18,531 --> 00:33:21,631
I'm gonna come clean with you.
I got abducted and I was threatened.

385
00:33:21,701 --> 00:33:24,571
You were gone for four days.
We had the police out.

386
00:33:24,645 --> 00:33:27,995
I'm tired of shootin' crap every night
to see if my main attraction will show.

387
00:33:28,071 --> 00:33:29,533
It's over.

388
00:33:30,566 --> 00:33:33,534
Look, I gotta borrow
a few bucks for cab fare.

389
00:33:33,607 --> 00:33:36,193
You're kidding.
How much?

390
00:33:36,264 --> 00:33:38,599
Nine hundred dollars.

391
00:33:51,946 --> 00:33:54,946
What's the matter?
Oh, I know this routine.

392
00:33:55,018 --> 00:33:58,334
Look, I'm a free agent.
I do as I please.

393
00:33:58,410 --> 00:34:01,989
I might as well tell you.
I quit the job.

394
00:34:02,059 --> 00:34:04,710
I told him to take that job
and stick it.

395
00:34:07,148 --> 00:34:10,923
So the band's leavin' for Hollywood
two weeks sooner than I thought.

396
00:34:12,077 --> 00:34:14,248
I didn't tell you
about Hollywood.

397
00:34:17,358 --> 00:34:19,300
We're makin' a movie.

398
00:34:19,374 --> 00:34:22,690
Yeah. Just a little short one.

399
00:34:22,766 --> 00:34:26,083
Just a couple of minutes of me and
the boys playin' that tune, "All Of Me."

400
00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:28,013
You know? Good.

401
00:34:29,519 --> 00:34:32,335
What are you lookin' at me
like that for? What?

402
00:34:34,511 --> 00:34:37,993
Look, I got together with
a couple of guys, we had a few drinks.

403
00:34:38,065 --> 00:34:41,099
One thing led to another...

404
00:34:41,169 --> 00:34:44,879
and the next thing I knew,
I woke up out of town.

405
00:34:47,026 --> 00:34:50,474
Look, I don't have to
account to you. All right?

406
00:34:50,547 --> 00:34:54,606
We're not married.
I'm not the marryin' kind.

407
00:34:54,675 --> 00:34:56,531
I can't settle.

408
00:34:58,100 --> 00:35:00,271
Whole idea leaves me cold.

409
00:35:02,068 --> 00:35:04,523
So I thought I'd...

410
00:35:04,596 --> 00:35:06,637
I thought I'd...

411
00:35:06,709 --> 00:35:09,131
buy you some lunch...

412
00:35:09,205 --> 00:35:11,060
and say good-bye.

413
00:35:12,342 --> 00:35:16,433
And I'll be comin' through here again,
I'm sure, sometime.

414
00:35:20,503 --> 00:35:23,057
But you really are
a spoiled dope, you know?

415
00:35:23,128 --> 00:35:26,902
I take you out to buy you things
or go to the movies, you're fine.

416
00:35:26,968 --> 00:35:29,587
But the minute somethin'
doesn't go your way...

417
00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:33,550
I gotta go, and there's
no way you can come with me.

418
00:35:33,625 --> 00:35:37,487
I mean, you got responsibilities.
You got a job.

419
00:35:37,561 --> 00:35:39,415
You have...

420
00:35:39,481 --> 00:35:42,198
underwear and socks to wash.

421
00:35:42,265 --> 00:35:45,561
And I can't have my life cluttered.
I'm an artist.

422
00:35:45,627 --> 00:35:47,602
A truly great artist.

423
00:35:47,675 --> 00:35:50,261
I need to be free...

424
00:35:50,332 --> 00:35:52,917
so I'm saying good-bye, okay?

425
00:35:57,245 --> 00:35:59,384
Look. How many fingers I got?

426
00:35:59,453 --> 00:36:00,947
Ten, right?

427
00:36:01,021 --> 00:36:04,404
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six.

428
00:36:06,526 --> 00:36:08,861
There's eleven. You see?

429
00:36:14,207 --> 00:36:16,596
All right, look.
If you come, it's not a free ride.

430
00:36:16,671 --> 00:36:19,321
I'm not a charity organization,
all right?

431
00:36:19,391 --> 00:36:22,042
I don't know what I'm doin' here.

432
00:36:22,112 --> 00:36:25,080
Hey, if you come, you work.

433
00:36:49,571 --> 00:36:51,099
What's the matter?

434
00:36:52,260 --> 00:36:54,333
Nobody said it was
gonna be a picnic.

435
00:36:54,405 --> 00:36:56,576
You know I can't
risk my hands.

436
00:37:37,931 --> 00:37:40,484
Well, that might not be a bad idea.

437
00:37:51,150 --> 00:37:53,085
And now, folks,
Chester Weems, a housepainter...

438
00:37:53,086 --> 00:37:55,020
And now, folks,
Chester Weems, a housepainter...

439
00:37:55,086 --> 00:37:56,941
will play the saw.

440
00:38:19,698 --> 00:38:24,369
Fast falls the eventide

441
00:38:24,435 --> 00:38:28,176
The darkness deepens

442
00:38:28,242 --> 00:38:32,018
Lord with me abide

443
00:38:32,083 --> 00:38:34,473
The scarlet tanager.

444
00:38:39,956 --> 00:38:41,811
The barn owl.

445
00:38:54,967 --> 00:38:56,975
And you are?

446
00:38:57,047 --> 00:38:59,732
Homer P. Risley.

447
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:01,873
What is your profession, Homer?

448
00:39:01,945 --> 00:39:04,758
Profession?
I'm a birdseed salesman.

449
00:39:04,823 --> 00:39:07,858
- Oh, a traveling salesman.
- That's right, you got it.

450
00:39:07,928 --> 00:39:11,027
And I see that
your instrument is the guitar.

451
00:39:11,097 --> 00:39:14,000
Yeah, that's right.
I've had a few lessons.

452
00:39:14,074 --> 00:39:17,521
No need to be nervous, Homer.
This is a wonderful audience out here.

453
00:39:19,897 --> 00:39:22,746
Birdseed salesman, Homer Risley.

454
00:40:37,573 --> 00:40:41,251
Boy, those guys were ready
to break out the tar and feathers, huh?

455
00:40:41,318 --> 00:40:44,134
Next time you're gonna hustle somebody,
don't play so great.

456
00:40:45,159 --> 00:40:47,744
I can't remember the tunes
if I play badly.

457
00:40:49,415 --> 00:40:52,099
I wonder if Django
ever hustled any suckers.

458
00:40:53,864 --> 00:40:56,931
Look at her. She's frownin'.
She doesn't like it.

459
00:40:57,001 --> 00:40:59,586
Well, they deserved it.
They were jerks.

460
00:41:01,417 --> 00:41:03,906
She's too good-hearted.

461
00:41:03,978 --> 00:41:08,834
A genuinely sweet person.
I like that, respect it.

462
00:41:08,906 --> 00:41:11,209
Won't get you anywhere in life.

463
00:41:14,571 --> 00:41:16,426
I had a dream last night.

464
00:41:17,836 --> 00:41:21,414
I had a dream
we all went out to Hollywood...

465
00:41:21,484 --> 00:41:24,549
and I became discovered
as a major star.

466
00:41:24,619 --> 00:41:27,238
You? A major star?

467
00:41:27,308 --> 00:41:29,065
You were dreamin'.

468
00:41:29,133 --> 00:41:31,305
Why not? I got a good face.

469
00:41:31,374 --> 00:41:34,538
We're in a short subject.
We're the backup band.

470
00:41:34,606 --> 00:41:38,698
We're in the background, Emmet.
We're lucky to be in focus.

471
00:41:38,766 --> 00:41:41,516
You can always get attention
if you know how to do it.

472
00:41:41,583 --> 00:41:44,715
In this dream,
I was standin' there surrounded...

473
00:41:44,784 --> 00:41:46,639
by gorgeous actresses.

474
00:41:48,016 --> 00:41:49,871
See? That she don't like.

475
00:41:49,936 --> 00:41:51,627
Relax.

476
00:41:51,697 --> 00:41:53,934
I'm with you now.

477
00:41:54,001 --> 00:41:57,579
I'm not one of these guys who turns
his head every time some dame walks by.

478
00:41:57,649 --> 00:42:00,203
I've had plenty
of beautiful women.

479
00:42:00,274 --> 00:42:02,794
And I always
put 'em in their place.

480
00:42:02,866 --> 00:42:05,867
Yeah. "Love 'em and leave 'em,"
that's my motto.

481
00:42:05,939 --> 00:42:10,162
Love 'em and don't look back.
I never once regretted.

482
00:42:10,227 --> 00:42:14,506
Not one time did I ever regret
dumping a beautiful dame.

483
00:42:14,581 --> 00:42:16,107
You gotta keep your guard up.

484
00:42:16,180 --> 00:42:20,239
If you don't, them pretty ones get
their worms in you, and then it's over.

485
00:42:20,309 --> 00:42:23,244
You're done.
Particularly if you're an artist.

486
00:42:23,318 --> 00:42:26,385
I've seen too many guys
cryin' in their beer.

487
00:42:26,455 --> 00:42:28,145
Me?

488
00:42:28,214 --> 00:42:30,068
I'm gonna be a star.

489
00:42:35,318 --> 00:42:36,944
All of me

490
00:42:37,015 --> 00:42:40,311
Why not take all of me

491
00:42:40,376 --> 00:42:42,001
Can't you see

492
00:42:42,072 --> 00:42:45,815
I'm no good without you

493
00:42:45,880 --> 00:42:47,637
Take my lips

494
00:42:47,705 --> 00:42:50,967
I wanna lose them

495
00:42:51,033 --> 00:42:52,976
Take my arms

496
00:42:53,050 --> 00:42:56,311
I'll never use them

497
00:42:56,378 --> 00:42:58,354
Your good-bye

498
00:42:58,427 --> 00:43:01,744
Left me with eyes that cry

499
00:43:01,820 --> 00:43:03,446
How can I

500
00:43:03,516 --> 00:43:07,377
Go on, dear
without you

501
00:43:07,450 --> 00:43:09,426
You took the part

502
00:43:09,500 --> 00:43:11,988
That once was my heart

503
00:43:12,060 --> 00:43:16,501
So why not take all of me

504
00:43:16,573 --> 00:43:18,941
The reason Emmet
hated Hollywood so much...

505
00:43:19,006 --> 00:43:21,689
was because Hattie
was discovered, not him.

506
00:43:21,757 --> 00:43:23,132
That was the truth of it.

507
00:43:23,198 --> 00:43:27,454
She was out there watching him film.
Every day she would hang out on the set.

508
00:43:27,519 --> 00:43:30,967
And one day, for, you know,
some crazy reason...

509
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:35,929
a director, who happened to be working
the same lot Emmet was on, noticed her.

510
00:43:36,001 --> 00:43:40,223
And the director thought, "This girl
is a dead ringer for May Talmadge."

511
00:43:40,289 --> 00:43:43,071
He was making a movie with
May Talmadge, who was a big star.

512
00:43:43,137 --> 00:43:47,872
And he thought Hattie is exactly what
he wanted to play May Talmadge's sister.

513
00:43:47,937 --> 00:43:50,621
And this is
a 30- second part or something.

514
00:43:50,690 --> 00:43:53,560
When he found out that Hattie couldn't
speak, it didn't make any difference...

515
00:43:53,635 --> 00:43:55,490
because the part
had no dialogue.

516
00:43:55,556 --> 00:43:58,938
He just knew he had to have
Hattie to play that part.

517
00:43:59,011 --> 00:44:01,761
Well, Emmet hated the whole idea.

518
00:44:17,093 --> 00:44:18,949
I can't believe you said yes.

519
00:44:19,014 --> 00:44:22,790
Did you nod that dopey face of yours?
Do they know you can't speak?

520
00:44:24,230 --> 00:44:26,719
I don't get it.
You're gonna embarrass me.

521
00:44:26,791 --> 00:44:29,726
Suddenly you're a movie actress.

522
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:31,655
Don't make me laugh.

523
00:45:27,248 --> 00:45:29,834
Now, as the story goes...

524
00:45:29,904 --> 00:45:32,806
Hattie was playing this love scene
with William Weston...

525
00:45:32,879 --> 00:45:36,491
this handsome older man
who always kissed his leading ladies...

526
00:45:36,561 --> 00:45:38,731
so they said,
with an open mouth.

527
00:45:38,799 --> 00:45:42,148
And he was kissing her,
and they were doing take after take...

528
00:45:42,223 --> 00:45:45,257
and he was kissing her over and over
with an open mouth.

529
00:45:45,327 --> 00:45:50,280
After 30 takes of getting kissed
by this gorgeous leading man...

530
00:45:50,351 --> 00:45:53,100
Hattie went into a small coma.

531
00:45:57,103 --> 00:45:59,339
And that was the last time...

532
00:45:59,406 --> 00:46:01,827
Emmet ever set foot in Hollywood.

533
00:46:01,903 --> 00:46:05,547
Yeah, I remember Emmet and Hattie
back East at that time.

534
00:46:05,614 --> 00:46:08,547
In fact, he had a good manager,
this cat named Sid Bishop.

535
00:46:08,622 --> 00:46:11,142
Sid was really good to him,
and he got him a lot of gigs.

536
00:46:11,214 --> 00:46:13,701
Emmet was doing really well,
and that really wasn't easy.

537
00:46:13,773 --> 00:46:16,676
Back then, a lot of musicians
were hurting from the Depression...

538
00:46:16,749 --> 00:46:19,302
and there wasn't
a lot of work to go around.

539
00:46:19,373 --> 00:46:21,544
But Emmet even agreed
at that time...

540
00:46:21,613 --> 00:46:24,330
to do a couple of sides
for the Victor label.

541
00:46:24,397 --> 00:46:26,983
He did "Melancholy Baby,"
"Exactly Like You"...

542
00:46:27,052 --> 00:46:29,256
and "I'll See You In My Dreams."

543
00:47:19,401 --> 00:47:22,151
- What do you mean, I'm broke?
- You give it away.

544
00:47:22,217 --> 00:47:24,550
You drink it up.
You pick up checks.

545
00:47:24,617 --> 00:47:27,683
You lose it in poolrooms, and
you're always buyin' Hattie presents.

546
00:47:27,753 --> 00:47:30,470
She's like a kid. She loves
tearin' the paper off the box.

547
00:47:30,537 --> 00:47:32,064
You gotta go on a budget.

548
00:47:32,137 --> 00:47:34,079
I'll go on a budget
if someone will straighten me out.

549
00:47:34,152 --> 00:47:36,062
A budget's not easy
for a guy like you.

550
00:47:36,137 --> 00:47:39,432
- When I set my mind to somethin'...
- You fight every good idea I have.

551
00:47:39,496 --> 00:47:41,634
I'll go on a budget.
I'll be good.

552
00:47:41,704 --> 00:47:44,126
What do you spend on clothes a year?
Do you have any idea?

553
00:47:44,200 --> 00:47:45,825
Want me to look like a bum?

554
00:47:45,896 --> 00:47:48,896
- What about rent?
- I don't know. It's all hotels.

555
00:47:48,968 --> 00:47:51,521
- Any idea what you spend on food?
- The booze gratis?

556
00:47:51,593 --> 00:47:55,869
Help yourself. Do you have any idea
what you spend on food or entertainment?

557
00:47:55,943 --> 00:47:58,879
Do you have any investments,
anything that'll throw off revenue?

558
00:47:58,951 --> 00:48:02,180
I got some savings,
mostly from Hattie takin' in laundry.

559
00:48:02,247 --> 00:48:05,314
Emmet, we gotta look
for places to cut down.

560
00:48:05,384 --> 00:48:08,416
I burned a hundred dollars once.
A guy dared me. He was a four-flusher.

561
00:48:08,487 --> 00:48:10,460
He burned a fifty,
I burned a hundred.

562
00:48:10,534 --> 00:48:14,015
He burned a twenty, I burned
another hundred. I could cut that out.

563
00:48:14,087 --> 00:48:16,770
You wanna end up
in the poorhouse when you're old?

564
00:48:16,838 --> 00:48:19,075
You ever see a poorhouse?

565
00:48:19,143 --> 00:48:22,142
From now on, your salary
and expenses will come to me.

566
00:48:22,214 --> 00:48:24,483
I'm puttin' you on an allowance.

567
00:48:24,550 --> 00:48:26,485
Okay, that's it.
The party's over.

568
00:48:26,486 --> 00:48:28,421
Okay, that's it.
The party's over.

569
00:48:28,486 --> 00:48:32,708
You're spendin' too much,
so now we've gotta go on a budget.

570
00:48:32,773 --> 00:48:36,450
Now, aside from food,
what are your expenses?

571
00:48:37,254 --> 00:48:39,871
What about the doctor bills?
You got a doctor?

572
00:48:39,941 --> 00:48:42,691
I bet you I get you
a veterinarian who's cheaper.

573
00:48:42,757 --> 00:48:44,861
And this is goin' out.

574
00:48:45,988 --> 00:48:48,159
What are we?
The electric company?

575
00:48:48,933 --> 00:48:51,550
We gotta save every penny.

576
00:48:52,677 --> 00:48:54,052
What is that?

577
00:48:59,492 --> 00:49:01,663
You remembered my birthday?

578
00:49:04,292 --> 00:49:06,147
We can't afford presents.

579
00:49:07,236 --> 00:49:10,170
That's gotta go back.
It's gotta go back.

580
00:49:16,547 --> 00:49:18,968
These are the kid gloves
I really wanted.

581
00:49:22,755 --> 00:49:25,340
Exactly the gloves
I wanted, these are.

582
00:49:28,674 --> 00:49:31,094
You know what I'm gonna do?
I'm gonna cut you a break.

583
00:49:31,170 --> 00:49:33,592
It's my birthday and...

584
00:49:33,666 --> 00:49:36,000
So I'm gonna let you
give 'em to me.

585
00:49:40,034 --> 00:49:41,889
You made this yourself?

586
00:49:48,384 --> 00:49:50,556
Your writin' looks like a chicken.

587
00:49:51,649 --> 00:49:54,912
Let's see.
"It's been almost a year...

588
00:49:54,978 --> 00:49:57,628
since we've been together."

589
00:49:57,697 --> 00:49:59,125
Ayear?

590
00:50:00,160 --> 00:50:02,549
Well, that's scary.

591
00:50:07,745 --> 00:50:09,719
What's this word here?

592
00:50:10,944 --> 00:50:13,277
Is that... Is that "love"?

593
00:50:15,840 --> 00:50:19,156
Oh, no. Don't go gettin'
any big ideas here.

594
00:50:19,232 --> 00:50:20,606
Jesus.

595
00:50:22,944 --> 00:50:25,014
I must've ate somethin' bad.

596
00:50:27,583 --> 00:50:29,917
I'm feelin'...
I'm gonna be sick.

597
00:50:36,382 --> 00:50:38,716
- Got somethin' for me today, Mr. Ray?
- I don't.

598
00:50:38,782 --> 00:50:41,597
- Mr. Ray, it's me, Charlie.
- I'm all tapped out.

599
00:50:41,662 --> 00:50:43,965
- You never let me down.
- Look.

600
00:50:44,031 --> 00:50:46,964
I'd like to help you,
but I'm on a budget.

601
00:50:47,037 --> 00:50:48,980
I haven't had
a bowl of soup all day.

602
00:50:49,054 --> 00:50:51,387
What, you wanna make me feel bad?

603
00:50:53,053 --> 00:50:55,901
- That's all you get.
- All right, thanks.

604
00:50:55,966 --> 00:50:58,038
Thanks, Mr. Ray.

605
00:50:58,109 --> 00:51:01,338
What's the urgency?
I came here as quick as I could.

606
00:51:01,405 --> 00:51:04,917
- Would you look at this thing?
- This is why I came quick to meet you?

607
00:51:04,988 --> 00:51:07,224
- He only wants 4,000 for it.
- Yeah, so?

608
00:51:07,291 --> 00:51:08,884
Does it fit the budget?

609
00:51:08,955 --> 00:51:11,323
Are you kidding?
We just sold one of your cars.

610
00:51:11,388 --> 00:51:14,138
I'm tryin' to unload
the other one, not buy one.

611
00:51:14,205 --> 00:51:15,730
- If I cut down?
- Cut down?

612
00:51:15,803 --> 00:51:19,186
- Where are you gonna get four grand?
- I'll borrow the money and pay it off.

613
00:51:19,260 --> 00:51:22,521
No one will lend you that kind of money,
and you'll be saddled with payments.

614
00:51:22,588 --> 00:51:24,693
- I want the car.
- No, Emmet.

615
00:51:24,764 --> 00:51:26,771
Hattie will give up desserts.

616
00:51:26,843 --> 00:51:29,176
- I want the car.
- It's out of the question.

617
00:51:29,242 --> 00:51:31,632
- I gotta have the car.
- You don't have the money.

618
00:51:31,707 --> 00:51:35,155
- I gotta have the car.
- There's no way!

619
00:51:35,227 --> 00:51:37,911
- We can't afford it.
- Stop sayin' "we."

620
00:51:37,979 --> 00:51:40,215
If I want the car,
I'm gonna get it.

621
00:51:40,282 --> 00:51:43,151
- Maybe someday, if it's in your budget.
- Budget! Budget!

622
00:51:43,226 --> 00:51:46,522
You're suffocating me with the budget.
I can't buy Hattie a birthday present.

623
00:51:46,587 --> 00:51:49,140
You can't buy champagne
if you can only afford beer.

624
00:51:49,211 --> 00:51:51,316
I'm the best guitar player
in the world!

625
00:51:51,387 --> 00:51:53,590
If I want the car,
I should have it.

626
00:51:53,658 --> 00:51:54,725
He said it, but he didn't believe it.

627
00:51:54,726 --> 00:51:55,793
He said it, but he didn't believe it.

628
00:51:55,864 --> 00:51:59,443
I mean, in his soul,
he worshipped Django Reinhardt.

629
00:51:59,513 --> 00:52:01,848
It was more than that.
He was frozen by him.

630
00:52:01,914 --> 00:52:04,150
Django was like a god to him.

631
00:52:04,218 --> 00:52:06,900
I don't know if this is true,
or just another Emmet Ray story...

632
00:52:06,969 --> 00:52:10,481
but Sid Bishop, who was trying
to help him financially at the time...

633
00:52:10,553 --> 00:52:14,065
got him a job in this club,
and one night, just before show time...

634
00:52:14,136 --> 00:52:17,398
one of the guys backstage
decides to play a joke on him...

635
00:52:17,465 --> 00:52:19,439
and tells him this lie.

636
00:52:19,512 --> 00:52:21,618
Hey, Emmet!

637
00:52:21,689 --> 00:52:25,551
Emmet, you're not gonna believe it.
Guess who's sittin' at the front table?

638
00:52:25,624 --> 00:52:27,990
Django Reinhardt.

639
00:52:28,056 --> 00:52:32,147
Are you kiddin' me? We should
get him up on stage with you.

640
00:52:32,216 --> 00:52:34,289
Reinhardt.

641
00:52:34,359 --> 00:52:36,629
He's gonna show him up.

642
00:52:36,696 --> 00:52:39,216
- I'm gonna...
- Come on.

643
00:52:39,288 --> 00:52:42,103
Emmet, we can get him
up on stage with us.

644
00:52:45,687 --> 00:52:48,501
- Django Reinhardt's here.
- Really?

645
00:52:54,744 --> 00:52:57,164
Hey, Django's not in the audience.

646
00:52:57,238 --> 00:53:00,271
The house is half-empty. There's
just some guy that looks like Django.

647
00:53:00,341 --> 00:53:02,798
Let's see if he's got
the nerve to come down.

648
00:53:02,870 --> 00:53:05,259
- Harry, let's go.
- Emmet, we're on!

649
00:53:05,334 --> 00:53:07,342
We should do it anyway.

650
00:53:08,405 --> 00:53:11,568
Emmet, come on down.
I'll wait for you.

651
00:53:11,636 --> 00:53:14,986
I'll take you to the front table myself.
I'll introduce you to Django.

652
00:53:15,062 --> 00:53:17,004
Now, as the story goes...

653
00:53:17,078 --> 00:53:20,820
Emmet, as you know, was pathologically
phobic about Django Reinhardt...

654
00:53:20,886 --> 00:53:23,470
so he tried to escape
through the roof.

655
00:53:23,541 --> 00:53:25,450
He just figured,
to hell with the job that night.

656
00:53:25,524 --> 00:53:29,452
But remember, this was a guy
who had fainted twice...

657
00:53:29,524 --> 00:53:32,459
when he came face-to-face
with Django Reinhardt in Europe.

658
00:53:32,533 --> 00:53:36,787
He's looking for a way out, and decides
to jump to the building next door.

659
00:53:36,851 --> 00:53:40,812
Well, as fate would have it,
he hits a weak spot in the roof...

660
00:53:40,883 --> 00:53:43,818
and crashes through
into somebody's apartment.

661
00:53:43,891 --> 00:53:47,339
As it happened, the apartment was
being used by some counterfeiters...

662
00:53:47,411 --> 00:53:50,640
who thought it was a raid when
he came through the roof, and ran out.

663
00:54:57,136 --> 00:54:59,786
Well, Eddie Durham,
the great jazz pioneer...

664
00:54:59,855 --> 00:55:02,605
met Emmet in Chicago in the 1930's.

665
00:55:02,672 --> 00:55:04,613
Here's what he said
about him in his book.

666
00:55:04,687 --> 00:55:07,556
"I met Emmet in Chicago.
It was the height of the Depression.

667
00:55:07,630 --> 00:55:11,886
Work was scarce. A lot of guys
took on teaching music as a sideline.

668
00:55:11,951 --> 00:55:13,478
Emmet refused.

669
00:55:13,551 --> 00:55:17,161
At that time he was married
to a woman named Blanche."

670
00:56:17,452 --> 00:56:19,523
- What are you doing?
- What?

671
00:56:19,594 --> 00:56:20,198
Nothing.

672
00:56:20,199 --> 00:56:20,803
Nothing.

673
00:56:20,875 --> 00:56:23,176
Excuse me, darling.

674
00:56:23,243 --> 00:56:25,098
You were stealing that box.

675
00:56:25,163 --> 00:56:27,781
- No.
- Oh, yes, you were. I saw you.

676
00:56:27,851 --> 00:56:30,088
Why?

677
00:56:30,155 --> 00:56:31,431
I don't know.

678
00:56:31,499 --> 00:56:33,537
You're a genius, you know?

679
00:56:33,610 --> 00:56:36,610
Eubie Blake thinks I'm the best guitar
player in the whole world, bar none.

680
00:56:36,682 --> 00:56:38,919
- And he knows Django.
- Truly?

681
00:56:38,986 --> 00:56:40,840
I'm Blanche Williams.

682
00:56:42,219 --> 00:56:45,283
- Are you gonna squeal on me?
- "Squeal" on you?

683
00:56:48,136 --> 00:56:51,268
Gosh. Not only are you
vain and egotistical...

684
00:56:51,337 --> 00:56:54,468
but you have genuine crudeness.

685
00:56:55,497 --> 00:56:57,351
I didn't want the goddamn thing.

686
00:56:59,112 --> 00:57:01,501
I won't squeal on you
if you take me for a drive...

687
00:57:01,576 --> 00:57:04,511
in that sublime automobile
of yours.

688
00:57:04,584 --> 00:57:05,992
Drive.

689
00:57:06,056 --> 00:57:07,617
Where?

690
00:57:07,689 --> 00:57:10,535
To the ends of the earth.
Astonish me.

691
00:57:15,784 --> 00:57:17,409
It's fun, isn't it?

692
00:57:17,480 --> 00:57:19,584
Well, it's definitely different.

693
00:57:19,655 --> 00:57:22,209
Make sure you don't pull it.
You squeeze it.

694
00:57:22,280 --> 00:57:24,133
Squeeze the trigger.

695
00:57:25,158 --> 00:57:28,061
- Do you do this often?
- Every chance I get.

696
00:57:28,134 --> 00:57:30,207
Specifically, what's the thrill?

697
00:57:30,279 --> 00:57:33,378
Well, I'm not sure, really.
There's one.

698
00:57:33,447 --> 00:57:36,130
And you got him!

699
00:57:36,199 --> 00:57:39,875
Do you get a bigger kick
doing this or stealing small objects?

700
00:57:39,942 --> 00:57:41,982
You know what?
I could really use a drink.

701
00:57:54,116 --> 00:57:57,019
I stop in here every time
I come through Chicago.

702
00:57:57,093 --> 00:57:58,948
She makes great chili.

703
00:57:59,013 --> 00:58:01,501
You like chili?

704
00:58:01,574 --> 00:58:03,940
What do you think of
when you play?

705
00:58:04,005 --> 00:58:05,980
What goes through your mind?

706
00:58:06,054 --> 00:58:07,907
What are your real feelings?

707
00:58:09,316 --> 00:58:11,771
I don't know.
That I'm underpaid.

708
00:58:11,844 --> 00:58:14,080
I think about that sometimes.

709
00:58:14,148 --> 00:58:16,157
Tell me about the girl
you lived with.

710
00:58:19,140 --> 00:58:21,661
She was nice, but I told her
not to fall in love with me.

711
00:58:21,733 --> 00:58:23,588
It was very one-sided.

712
00:58:25,252 --> 00:58:27,553
She was nice, but I just
cut out one night.

713
00:58:27,619 --> 00:58:29,888
She was asleep, I left 500 cash
by the bed, got my stuff...

714
00:58:29,955 --> 00:58:31,811
and got outta there
at 4:00 in the morning.

715
00:58:31,876 --> 00:58:33,369
I didn't want a scene.

716
00:58:33,444 --> 00:58:35,745
She must have really loved you.

717
00:58:35,811 --> 00:58:39,487
I didn't say it was
an easy decision, but...

718
00:58:39,554 --> 00:58:41,410
I needed more than Hattie.

719
00:58:41,476 --> 00:58:44,060
- Do you miss her?
- Not a bit.

720
00:58:44,130 --> 00:58:45,537
I did the right thing for me.

721
00:58:45,603 --> 00:58:47,674
Maybe I wouldn't have met you.

722
00:58:47,746 --> 00:58:50,975
Come on, Emmet. Join us, man.
Cut loose with the fellas.

723
00:58:51,042 --> 00:58:53,279
- You know you want to.
- Yeah?

724
00:58:53,346 --> 00:58:54,938
Please.

725
00:58:55,010 --> 00:58:57,727
Come. You'll enjoy this.
I'm great. I really am.

726
00:59:33,599 --> 00:59:37,430
After-hours jam session.
Chicago South Side.

727
00:59:37,504 --> 00:59:39,392
He's like a cat...

728
00:59:39,457 --> 00:59:43,611
feline with the guitar, which is
his only, certainly deepest love.

729
00:59:43,679 --> 00:59:46,778
No, his only. The sound...

730
00:59:46,848 --> 00:59:48,853
the beat, the ideas.

731
00:59:48,926 --> 00:59:51,066
Where do they come from?

732
00:59:51,135 --> 00:59:53,469
Any woman would be second
to his music.

733
00:59:53,535 --> 00:59:57,180
He wouldn't miss me any more
than the woman he abruptly left.

734
00:59:57,247 --> 00:59:59,930
He could only feel pain
for his music.

735
00:59:59,999 --> 01:00:03,065
Such is the ego of genius.

736
01:00:03,135 --> 01:00:04,990
Must get used to it.

737
01:00:07,901 --> 01:00:10,007
I used to have a stable of girls
in this town.

738
01:00:10,078 --> 01:00:11,419
- No.
- Yeah.

739
01:00:11,485 --> 01:00:14,333
I made some money, but...

740
01:00:14,398 --> 01:00:17,627
whores are unpredictable.

741
01:00:17,694 --> 01:00:19,548
- They're nuts.
- Really?

742
01:00:19,614 --> 01:00:22,067
Yeah. But money's money.

743
01:00:22,139 --> 01:00:24,245
I mean, you pimped
and you procured?

744
01:00:25,821 --> 01:00:27,862
I can't stand it.
It's just too perfect.

745
01:00:27,934 --> 01:00:29,656
- I don't like that word.
- Which?

746
01:00:29,725 --> 01:00:33,139
"Pimp." No, I was a manager.

747
01:00:33,212 --> 01:00:36,507
- What's too perfect?
- That whole seamy world.

748
01:00:36,572 --> 01:00:41,242
The girls I came out with were whores
too, only we called them debutantes.

749
01:00:41,309 --> 01:00:44,276
I lived in a whorehouse
when I was 18 for six months.

750
01:00:44,348 --> 01:00:46,453
Didn't have a job and no money.

751
01:00:46,524 --> 01:00:49,338
The madam put me up.
She was a friend of my mother's.

752
01:00:50,556 --> 01:00:52,410
I'm sure you learned a lot there.

753
01:00:53,723 --> 01:00:56,571
I don't know.
It's like being a cook.

754
01:00:56,636 --> 01:00:59,634
- A cook?
- You're in the kitchen all day.

755
01:00:59,706 --> 01:01:01,562
You don't want to look at the food.

756
01:01:03,483 --> 01:01:06,581
I'd love to be a whore for a year.
Just a year.

757
01:01:06,651 --> 01:01:08,506
If you ever want a manager...

758
01:01:09,946 --> 01:01:12,247
Look. That's a beauty.

759
01:01:12,313 --> 01:01:15,096
What is this fascination
with trains?

760
01:01:15,162 --> 01:01:17,018
What do you mean?

761
01:01:17,083 --> 01:01:21,206
Do you have the urge to go off,
to ride to unknown destinations?

762
01:01:21,274 --> 01:01:22,681
For what point?

763
01:01:22,746 --> 01:01:26,738
Are you trying to recapture some
intangible feeling from childhood...

764
01:01:26,808 --> 01:01:30,671
when you dreamt of glamorous cities
just out of reach?

765
01:01:30,746 --> 01:01:34,194
I'm not trying to capture anything
from childhood. It stank.

766
01:01:34,265 --> 01:01:37,428
Then I can only think it must be
the power of the locomotive...

767
01:01:37,496 --> 01:01:41,588
the sheer, potent sexual energy
that arouses your masculinity.

768
01:01:41,657 --> 01:01:46,360
The wheels, the hot furnace,
the pistons pumping.

769
01:01:46,425 --> 01:01:49,009
You sound like you wanna
go to bed with the train.

770
01:02:23,510 --> 01:02:25,364
He's impulsive and hot-tempered...

771
01:02:25,430 --> 01:02:29,686
yet he listens to the recordings
of Django Reinhardt for hours and cries.

772
01:02:29,751 --> 01:02:32,947
He has never met this gypsy guitarist
and never wants to.

773
01:02:33,014 --> 01:02:35,534
I think because he doesn't
want to learn Django's mortal.

774
01:02:36,759 --> 01:02:38,612
He sleeps with the light on
in the room...

775
01:02:38,677 --> 01:02:43,117
and last night he woke up screaming
the name of his old girlfriend Hattie.

776
01:02:43,189 --> 01:02:45,262
Then he asked me to marry him.

777
01:03:07,220 --> 01:03:09,074
Get a load of those legs?

778
01:03:10,612 --> 01:03:12,587
Take your hat off.
She grew up with a butler.

779
01:03:16,499 --> 01:03:18,953
It was very impulsive.

780
01:03:19,026 --> 01:03:22,026
And as soon as they were married,
right from the start...

781
01:03:22,100 --> 01:03:24,488
it was very shaky.

782
01:03:24,563 --> 01:03:28,240
Why did he marry her so suddenly?
I don't know.

783
01:03:28,307 --> 01:03:31,405
You know, they only had one thing
in common: Clothes.

784
01:03:31,474 --> 01:03:33,415
They were like two peacocks.

785
01:03:33,490 --> 01:03:37,451
But there was always an unreal
quality to the whole thing.

786
01:03:37,522 --> 01:03:40,392
Talk about doomed relationships.

787
01:03:40,467 --> 01:03:42,408
I feel like gettin' out.

788
01:03:42,482 --> 01:03:45,264
Me too, Emmet, but we're broke.

789
01:03:45,331 --> 01:03:47,719
He's gonna give me my job back!
He said so.

790
01:03:47,794 --> 01:03:50,249
If you show up on time,
and then not always drunk.

791
01:03:50,321 --> 01:03:52,176
Somethin' comes over me.
I get cold sweats.

792
01:03:52,241 --> 01:03:54,097
You're not sorry we got married,
are you?

793
01:03:54,162 --> 01:03:56,016
Of course not!
You're a beautiful woman.

794
01:03:56,081 --> 01:03:59,114
- Do you love me?
- What's this all about?

795
01:03:59,185 --> 01:04:02,185
I'm trying to analyze your feelings
so I can write about them.

796
01:04:02,257 --> 01:04:05,224
I'm your husband.
I'm not some goddamn book idea!

797
01:04:06,384 --> 01:04:09,002
Have you ever cried
over the loss of anyone?

798
01:04:09,072 --> 01:04:11,723
- Your mother, your father?
- Not in me.

799
01:04:11,792 --> 01:04:14,662
You let your insides get to you
and you're finished.

800
01:04:14,736 --> 01:04:18,479
If you just let your feelings out,
you might even play better.

801
01:04:18,544 --> 01:04:19,950
Richer.

802
01:04:20,015 --> 01:04:23,147
Someone else said that to me once.
Everybody knows everything.

803
01:04:23,216 --> 01:04:26,445
I've been trying to analyze what
separates your playing from Django's...

804
01:04:26,512 --> 01:04:28,749
and I say it's that
his feelings are richer.

805
01:04:28,816 --> 01:04:32,296
He's not afraid to suffer
in front of anybody.

806
01:04:32,367 --> 01:04:35,432
- He doesn't hold things in check...
- Stop talking about Django!

807
01:04:35,503 --> 01:04:38,798
The guy haunts me. All right?
Enough about Django.

808
01:04:56,046 --> 01:04:58,053
Yeah.

809
01:04:58,126 --> 01:05:00,972
- I want to see Mr. Bedloe.
- Be back in a minute.

810
01:05:01,037 --> 01:05:02,891
Do you mind if I wait?

811
01:05:04,332 --> 01:05:06,188
Got an appointment?

812
01:05:06,253 --> 01:05:08,293
- May I?
- Go ahead.

813
01:05:08,365 --> 01:05:09,740
Nope.

814
01:05:11,660 --> 01:05:13,865
- Who are you?
- I work for him.

815
01:05:15,981 --> 01:05:17,835
I've seen you around.

816
01:05:19,213 --> 01:05:22,955
- You're his strong-arm man.
- He don't need no help.

817
01:05:23,020 --> 01:05:25,736
I saw you beat somebody up
in the alley last week.

818
01:05:28,235 --> 01:05:31,105
- You're the guitar player's wife.
- That's right.

819
01:05:31,179 --> 01:05:33,089
- I noticed you too.
- You did?

820
01:05:33,162 --> 01:05:35,019
Lots of times.

821
01:05:39,020 --> 01:05:40,962
Why does Mr. Bedloe
need a bodyguard?

822
01:05:41,035 --> 01:05:43,369
You come here to ask
for your husband's job back?

823
01:05:43,435 --> 01:05:46,184
Is it true Mr. Bedloe
runs some rackets?

824
01:05:46,250 --> 01:05:48,869
Joe thinks the world of
your husband's guitar playing.

825
01:05:48,939 --> 01:05:51,326
He thinks he's a genius, but...

826
01:05:51,401 --> 01:05:53,988
I mean, let's be honest.
Either he comes in here late...

827
01:05:54,059 --> 01:05:56,098
or he comes in drunk
or he don't come in at all...

828
01:05:56,170 --> 01:05:59,433
and that's no way
to run a nightclub.

829
01:05:59,499 --> 01:06:02,083
I thinkJoe's cooled down.
He was pretty hot the other night.

830
01:06:04,010 --> 01:06:07,654
I hope you don't
mind me asking, but...

831
01:06:07,721 --> 01:06:09,794
you're wearing a gun,
aren't you?

832
01:06:10,858 --> 01:06:12,232
Not me.

833
01:06:13,385 --> 01:06:15,239
Did you ever kill anyone?

834
01:06:25,129 --> 01:06:27,976
Don't tell me that you never
noticed me staring at you.

835
01:06:28,040 --> 01:06:29,895
- No, I...
- You come in here a couple of nights.

836
01:06:29,960 --> 01:06:32,164
I couldn't take my eyes off you.

837
01:06:32,232 --> 01:06:35,080
- Really?
- I love that blue silk dress you wear.

838
01:06:36,520 --> 01:06:39,040
Oh, yes. That... Gee.

839
01:06:41,031 --> 01:06:42,887
It's warm in here.

840
01:06:45,415 --> 01:06:47,652
Morning, Mr. Bedloe.

841
01:06:47,720 --> 01:06:50,273
You're a smart girl.
You come from a good home.

842
01:06:50,344 --> 01:06:53,540
What are you doin' with a drunken
guitar player for a husband?

843
01:06:53,607 --> 01:06:56,388
Okay, he's a brilliant musician,
but who can live with him?

844
01:06:56,454 --> 01:06:59,138
Not me.
I'll bet it's no picnic for you.

845
01:06:59,206 --> 01:07:01,247
He wants me to tell you
he's learned his lesson.

846
01:07:01,320 --> 01:07:03,174
Do you think
I was born yesterday?

847
01:07:03,239 --> 01:07:07,810
- I know you think he's great.
- Great? His playin' makes me cry.

848
01:07:07,879 --> 01:07:09,820
Does he bring in customers?
Some.

849
01:07:09,894 --> 01:07:13,190
Mostly aficionados.
When he shows up.

850
01:07:13,254 --> 01:07:16,451
We found him the other night
staring at freight trains at 9:00.

851
01:07:16,519 --> 01:07:18,558
- He's gonna turn over a new leaf.
- Right.

852
01:07:18,630 --> 01:07:20,190
He's through drinkin'.

853
01:07:20,262 --> 01:07:22,945
Right. All right, look.

854
01:07:23,013 --> 01:07:26,145
I'm a soft touch, but I don't
like to be made a fool.

855
01:07:26,214 --> 01:07:30,969
Out of respect for you, who I like,
I'm gonna give him one more shot.

856
01:07:31,044 --> 01:07:34,143
But if you want my advice,
no genius is worth too much heartache.

857
01:07:39,140 --> 01:07:42,337
- How'd you do?
- He's such a nice man.

858
01:07:42,404 --> 01:07:44,127
You wanna celebrate?

859
01:07:44,196 --> 01:07:47,043
- Celebrate?
- Yeah, have a drink with me.

860
01:07:47,107 --> 01:07:48,570
Come on.

861
01:07:49,603 --> 01:07:51,841
Well, I guess.

862
01:07:51,908 --> 01:07:54,493
There are a few things
I wouldn't mind finding out.

863
01:07:54,563 --> 01:07:57,911
I'm a writer, and extreme characters
always fascinate me.

864
01:07:57,986 --> 01:07:59,841
I ain't so extreme.

865
01:07:59,907 --> 01:08:01,794
Everybody I ever rubbed out
deserved it.

866
01:08:01,860 --> 01:08:04,346
"Rubbed out"?

867
01:08:04,419 --> 01:08:06,362
That's so colorful and...

868
01:08:06,436 --> 01:08:09,185
What goes through your mind
when you're rubbing someone out?

869
01:08:09,251 --> 01:08:11,617
Through my mind?

870
01:08:11,682 --> 01:08:14,268
What do you think about
when you pull the trigger?

871
01:08:14,338 --> 01:08:16,542
Well, I don't know.

872
01:08:16,610 --> 01:08:19,905
Yet you're able
to just shoot someone.

873
01:08:19,971 --> 01:08:22,751
I don't want to shock you, but...

874
01:08:22,817 --> 01:08:24,727
it always came natural to me.

875
01:08:24,801 --> 01:08:25,980
Really?

876
01:08:26,051 --> 01:08:28,734
Ever since I was 15
and I first picked up a gun...

877
01:08:30,081 --> 01:08:33,180
I discovered that
I had a knack for it.

878
01:08:33,249 --> 01:08:35,867
Fascinating.

879
01:08:35,937 --> 01:08:39,069
- What are you doing?
- You have very soft hair.

880
01:08:39,137 --> 01:08:41,275
- Don't.
- Why?

881
01:08:41,345 --> 01:08:42,906
I'm scared.

882
01:08:42,977 --> 01:08:44,983
Because I kill for a living.

883
01:08:47,680 --> 01:08:49,884
Because I find you attractive.

884
01:09:01,504 --> 01:09:05,300
Blanche was a writer.
Some kind of a writer.

885
01:09:05,375 --> 01:09:07,994
Not famous or anything,
but she was published.

886
01:09:08,064 --> 01:09:11,925
In fact, she wrote a story called...

887
01:09:11,999 --> 01:09:14,301
"Strutting and Fretting."

888
01:09:14,367 --> 01:09:18,360
And it's vaguely about some of the
stormy times she and Emmet were having.

889
01:09:20,734 --> 01:09:23,223
Why am I bored with my husband?

890
01:09:23,295 --> 01:09:25,269
It's all so complicated.

891
01:09:25,343 --> 01:09:28,189
In the end, I married
for the wrong reasons.

892
01:09:28,254 --> 01:09:31,417
And why Emmet rushed into marriage
with me is a mystery.

893
01:09:34,173 --> 01:09:36,029
Five in the corner.

894
01:09:39,453 --> 01:09:42,323
- That's all she wrote.
- Lucky shot.

895
01:09:42,397 --> 01:09:44,502
You couldn't make
that shot again if you tried.

896
01:09:44,573 --> 01:09:47,421
Don't give me that.
Just hand it over.

897
01:09:47,486 --> 01:09:49,459
I'm one of the two, three top
pool players in the country.

898
01:09:49,532 --> 01:09:52,282
No shame in losin' to me.
Thank you very much.

899
01:09:52,349 --> 01:09:54,934
- Come here. I want to talk to you.
- Yeah.

900
01:09:55,006 --> 01:09:57,394
Look, we know each other, right?

901
01:09:57,468 --> 01:09:59,410
I don't like to cause
any problems...

902
01:09:59,484 --> 01:10:01,623
so I wanted to give you
a little tip.

903
01:10:01,693 --> 01:10:03,415
On a horse? Couple of beers.

904
01:10:03,484 --> 01:10:05,873
No, not on a horse.

905
01:10:05,948 --> 01:10:08,314
I want to give you a tip.

906
01:10:08,379 --> 01:10:10,235
Keep an eye on your wife.

907
01:10:10,301 --> 01:10:12,853
- What do you mean?
- Just keep an eye on her.

908
01:10:12,924 --> 01:10:14,679
Why?

909
01:10:14,747 --> 01:10:18,042
Because she's been spendin'
a lot of time with Al Torrio.

910
01:10:19,579 --> 01:10:21,040
Who?

911
01:10:21,115 --> 01:10:23,669
Al Torrio. The hood
that hangs around Bedloe.

912
01:10:23,740 --> 01:10:26,357
The bodyguard? And Blanche?
Are you nuts?

913
01:10:26,427 --> 01:10:29,143
- Just tellin' you what's goin' around.
- What kind of mind you got?

914
01:10:29,210 --> 01:10:32,507
Blanche'd never make a fool outta me
with some strong- arm stooge.

915
01:10:32,571 --> 01:10:34,425
- Where'd you hear this?
- Here and there.

916
01:10:34,490 --> 01:10:37,490
That's why I'm telling you. I didn't
think you'd want people laughin' at you.

917
01:10:37,564 --> 01:10:41,076
Laughin' at me?
You know how rumors get started.

918
01:10:43,322 --> 01:10:47,348
Come on. This is what happens when you
have a wife everybody's envious of.

919
01:10:47,417 --> 01:10:49,490
It's jealousy,
but I'm not the jealous type.

920
01:10:49,562 --> 01:10:52,050
- They're tryin' to knock me down.
- Hope you're right.

921
01:11:09,528 --> 01:11:12,495
I've heard stories about this
from musicians...

922
01:11:12,568 --> 01:11:14,642
I've read about it,
but I don't really know.

923
01:11:14,712 --> 01:11:15,956
I know that...

924
01:11:16,025 --> 01:11:19,700
apparently, Emmet tried
to follow Blanche one day.

925
01:11:19,767 --> 01:11:22,964
I believe she told him she was
going to the dentist or something...

926
01:11:23,032 --> 01:11:25,072
and he followed her.

927
01:12:05,845 --> 01:12:07,787
You gotta go home right away?

928
01:12:07,861 --> 01:12:10,162
I think Emmet's at the poolroom.

929
01:12:10,228 --> 01:12:12,084
Come on.
Let's go for a drive.

930
01:12:16,949 --> 01:12:19,055
You know, I didn't
care too much for that movie.

931
01:12:19,125 --> 01:12:21,066
- No?
- I like Cagney.

932
01:12:21,140 --> 01:12:23,081
Guns, bullets, shootin',
a little action.

933
01:12:24,564 --> 01:12:26,867
How does it feel
when you actually kill?

934
01:12:26,933 --> 01:12:29,420
What goes through your mind?

935
01:12:29,492 --> 01:12:31,859
What do you gotta ask
the questions for all the time?

936
01:12:31,925 --> 01:12:33,168
Because I wanna know.

937
01:12:33,909 --> 01:12:38,064
Emmet has a violent side, but it
all turns to passion in his music.

938
01:12:38,131 --> 01:12:41,165
With you there's just not
a shred of sublimation.

939
01:12:41,236 --> 01:12:43,090
It's incredible.

940
01:12:43,155 --> 01:12:45,163
Let me ask you one question.

941
01:12:45,236 --> 01:12:47,504
Who makes love to you better,
me or him?

942
01:12:48,819 --> 01:12:51,185
Emmet is an artist,
and because he's an artist...

943
01:12:51,250 --> 01:12:52,843
he needs no one.

944
01:12:53,586 --> 01:12:58,375
Even making love, he seems to exist
in a world all of his own.

945
01:12:58,451 --> 01:13:02,761
With you I feel like I'm looking
right into the heart of darkness.

946
01:13:02,834 --> 01:13:05,868
I become crazy when you touch me.

947
01:13:05,939 --> 01:13:07,120
Okay, so now Emmet is fuming.

948
01:13:07,121 --> 01:13:08,302
Okay, so now Emmet is fuming.

949
01:13:08,370 --> 01:13:10,826
I mean, he found out
that Torrio and Blanche...

950
01:13:10,899 --> 01:13:13,548
have gone to bed with each other,
that they're lovers.

951
01:13:13,617 --> 01:13:16,039
And he's consumed with rage.

952
01:13:16,113 --> 01:13:20,903
Now, just at that moment,
Torrio decides to pull off the road...

953
01:13:20,978 --> 01:13:23,530
and go into a gas station
to buy some cigarettes.

954
01:13:23,601 --> 01:13:26,633
And there's Emmet
in the back of the car...

955
01:13:26,704 --> 01:13:29,454
and he's trying very hard to
figure out who he wants to shoot.

956
01:13:29,520 --> 01:13:32,171
Does he want to shoot Blanche?
Torrio?

957
01:13:32,240 --> 01:13:33,833
Should he shoot
both of them together?

958
01:13:33,904 --> 01:13:35,977
He's working on this problem.

959
01:13:36,048 --> 01:13:39,911
They go into the store,
and exactly at that moment...

960
01:13:39,984 --> 01:13:41,838
a holdup is taking place.

961
01:13:41,904 --> 01:13:46,247
Two guys come running out.
They don't know what to do.

962
01:13:46,320 --> 01:13:48,621
All hell is breaking loose.
There's gunshots.

963
01:13:48,688 --> 01:13:50,597
Instead of taking their car...

964
01:13:50,671 --> 01:13:54,086
Torrio's got a big car.
They jump in that and pull off.

965
01:14:09,422 --> 01:14:11,397
Calling all cars.

966
01:14:34,476 --> 01:14:35,786
I'm Emmet Ray.

967
01:14:35,853 --> 01:14:38,187
I'm the greatest guitar player
in the world.

968
01:14:38,253 --> 01:14:40,675
Except maybe this gypsy.

969
01:14:40,749 --> 01:14:44,261
Perhaps you heard my recording of
"You Were Meant For Me," RCA Victor.

970
01:14:45,452 --> 01:14:48,518
You were meant for me

971
01:14:49,740 --> 01:14:50,747
That's not what I heard.

972
01:14:50,748 --> 01:14:51,755
That's not what I heard.

973
01:14:51,820 --> 01:14:54,056
But like all Emmet Ray stories...

974
01:14:54,123 --> 01:14:57,603
you never know what's made up,
exaggerated, true.

975
01:14:57,675 --> 01:15:00,708
You never know what to believe.
What I heard was this.

976
01:15:00,779 --> 01:15:03,627
I heard that when they
pulled into the gas station...

977
01:15:03,691 --> 01:15:05,961
Blanche gets out
to get some cigarettes...

978
01:15:06,028 --> 01:15:07,881
and that's
when he confronted them.

979
01:15:09,291 --> 01:15:12,706
How could you? How could you
cheat on me with a bum like that?

980
01:15:12,779 --> 01:15:13,761
Emmet, don't!

981
01:15:13,835 --> 01:15:15,907
Make a fool out of me
in front of everybody!

982
01:15:15,979 --> 01:15:18,880
So I slept with him.
But I was just researching a book!

983
01:15:18,953 --> 01:15:20,361
I loved you!

984
01:15:21,738 --> 01:15:23,593
Don't be crazy. Do something!

985
01:15:25,737 --> 01:15:29,121
I'm sorry. My tire blew out.

986
01:15:29,194 --> 01:15:33,349
Believe me, he never tried to kill
himself, because Emmet Ray was...

987
01:15:33,417 --> 01:15:36,679
He had much too much ego
for anything like that.

988
01:15:38,409 --> 01:15:40,351
A story that Eddie Condon
tells about...

989
01:15:40,425 --> 01:15:42,760
And Eddie Condon definitely
was not a reliable source...

990
01:15:42,826 --> 01:15:44,964
'cause he was
a big embellisher himself.

991
01:15:45,033 --> 01:15:48,775
But the story Eddie Condon tells,
I believe...

992
01:15:48,840 --> 01:15:51,490
is that Torrio was aware...

993
01:15:51,561 --> 01:15:55,238
that the fact that he was a gangster
was a big turn- on for Blanche.

994
01:15:55,305 --> 01:15:56,307
And so he decided...

995
01:15:56,308 --> 01:15:57,309
And so he decided...

996
01:15:57,383 --> 01:16:00,351
that he would
pull into this gas station...

997
01:16:00,424 --> 01:16:02,278
and he would stick it up.

998
01:16:07,464 --> 01:16:10,279
- Can I help you, sir?
- Get your hands in the air, Pops.

999
01:16:10,344 --> 01:16:11,937
Give me everything
in the register!

1000
01:16:12,008 --> 01:16:14,856
Emmet was so panicked
by hearing gunshots...

1001
01:16:14,920 --> 01:16:17,767
he crept into the front seat
and took off.

1002
01:16:17,832 --> 01:16:22,338
He didn't get more than 50 feet
before he crashed into an oncoming car.

1003
01:16:22,407 --> 01:16:26,662
Now there's this terrible crash.
Miraculously, no one is hurt.

1004
01:16:26,727 --> 01:16:30,273
And who gets out of the car
but a group of musicians.

1005
01:16:30,343 --> 01:16:32,198
I can't remember who it was.

1006
01:16:32,263 --> 01:16:35,808
It was like Buck Clayton, Coleman
Hawkins, Teddy Wilson or something.

1007
01:16:35,878 --> 01:16:39,806
But there, suddenly,
standing in front of Emmet...

1008
01:16:39,878 --> 01:16:41,731
is Django Reinhardt.

1009
01:16:55,589 --> 01:16:58,077
I believe later that year...

1010
01:16:58,150 --> 01:17:00,570
Emmet turned up in New Jersey...

1011
01:17:00,644 --> 01:17:04,834
and made that recording he did
of one of his own compositions.

1012
01:17:04,900 --> 01:17:06,558
"Unfaithful Woman."

1013
01:17:29,955 --> 01:17:31,580
Very good, everybody.

1014
01:17:31,651 --> 01:17:34,303
- Particularly me.
- That was great. And me.

1015
01:17:34,372 --> 01:17:37,852
- Let's go get somethin' to eat.
- Emmet, we're going to New York.

1016
01:17:37,923 --> 01:17:41,468
We're goin' to New York.
The big money.

1017
01:17:41,539 --> 01:17:43,448
Can I get those cigarettes?

1018
01:17:43,522 --> 01:17:47,384
Em, I tell you, the music business
really picked up, just like you said.

1019
01:17:47,457 --> 01:17:50,774
We got some dancers lined up for
tonight, pretty ones. They are wild.

1020
01:18:39,232 --> 01:18:41,085
How are you?

1021
01:18:44,063 --> 01:18:45,917
You look healthy.

1022
01:18:49,695 --> 01:18:52,728
I'm in town makin' a record.

1023
01:18:52,798 --> 01:18:55,514
I wrote a beautiful tune.
It's a classic.

1024
01:18:58,654 --> 01:19:00,510
I'm sorry I cut out
on you like that.

1025
01:19:01,950 --> 01:19:04,220
It was time to move on.

1026
01:19:04,287 --> 01:19:06,674
I was fair. I told you
not to fall in love with me.

1027
01:19:06,748 --> 01:19:09,138
It's nothin' personal.

1028
01:19:09,214 --> 01:19:11,188
It's just, I'm an artist.

1029
01:19:14,654 --> 01:19:17,272
I like women,
but they gotta have their place.

1030
01:19:21,276 --> 01:19:22,804
You angry with me?

1031
01:19:24,892 --> 01:19:26,452
You have every right to be.

1032
01:19:26,524 --> 01:19:28,411
I don't hold it against you.

1033
01:19:29,533 --> 01:19:31,637
I even thought of you
a couple of times.

1034
01:19:34,428 --> 01:19:36,848
My wife said...

1035
01:19:36,924 --> 01:19:38,832
I said your name once
in my sleep.

1036
01:19:42,557 --> 01:19:44,411
Must have had a nightmare
or somethin'.

1037
01:19:47,130 --> 01:19:48,723
Yeah.

1038
01:19:48,794 --> 01:19:52,658
I had a wife. She's gone now,
and believe me, I don't miss her.

1039
01:19:52,731 --> 01:19:54,804
I don't mean to say
I miss you either...

1040
01:19:54,876 --> 01:19:57,143
but I didn't have
any bad feelings about you.

1041
01:20:00,857 --> 01:20:04,119
We got a real good contract at a club
in New York for a year. Good dough.

1042
01:20:10,138 --> 01:20:13,106
Maybe you'd like to come.

1043
01:20:13,178 --> 01:20:14,584
You know?

1044
01:20:14,649 --> 01:20:17,137
I'm not makin' any promises, but...

1045
01:20:17,209 --> 01:20:19,511
I think you might have fun.

1046
01:20:19,577 --> 01:20:23,701
You'd be in New York with...

1047
01:20:23,769 --> 01:20:26,518
one of the two best
guitar players in the world...

1048
01:20:28,249 --> 01:20:30,387
six best poker players.

1049
01:20:30,456 --> 01:20:32,311
Not countin' that.

1050
01:20:34,616 --> 01:20:36,471
We leave tomorrow, if you want.

1051
01:20:36,536 --> 01:20:38,359
If you don't, I understand.

1052
01:20:38,425 --> 01:20:41,741
You know? Then it'd be
"It was nice seeing you again.

1053
01:20:41,817 --> 01:20:43,192
Good luck."

1054
01:20:45,657 --> 01:20:47,511
I never could
get your handwritin'.

1055
01:20:57,335 --> 01:20:58,709
Happily?

1056
01:21:01,174 --> 01:21:02,548
Got kids?

1057
01:21:06,872 --> 01:21:08,245
Boy or girl?

1058
01:21:10,069 --> 01:21:12,013
Boy?

1059
01:21:12,087 --> 01:21:13,460
Girl?

1060
01:21:18,230 --> 01:21:20,084
It's just as well.

1061
01:21:21,494 --> 01:21:24,755
I wouldn't want to give you the wrong
impression. You'd get attached to me.

1062
01:21:24,821 --> 01:21:27,155
And you know me.
I can't take entanglements.

1063
01:21:30,773 --> 01:21:34,418
I gotta go. We're gonna take
some chorus girls out tonight.

1064
01:21:34,485 --> 01:21:36,341
And I'm leavin' tomorrow.

1065
01:21:40,052 --> 01:21:41,907
Take it easy.

1066
01:22:36,882 --> 01:22:41,737
I'm the greatest solo instrumentalist
on the guitar you'll ever hear.

1067
01:22:41,810 --> 01:22:42,703
Oh, yeah?

1068
01:22:42,769 --> 01:22:46,314
The public's just getting to know my
name. Next year, I'll be in the money.

1069
01:22:48,274 --> 01:22:51,174
You're a real looker.
You are a real looker.

1070
01:22:51,248 --> 01:22:54,347
- You're not that bad yourself.
- I mean it!

1071
01:22:54,416 --> 01:22:57,678
Maybe that's why the men give me
a lot of tips when I dance.

1072
01:22:57,744 --> 01:22:59,468
You wanna go watch trains?

1073
01:22:59,537 --> 01:23:00,943
What?

1074
01:23:01,008 --> 01:23:02,470
- Come on.
- Trains?

1075
01:23:02,545 --> 01:23:03,973
Wait. Where are we going?

1076
01:23:04,048 --> 01:23:06,830
- Jesus.
- Outta the way.

1077
01:23:06,896 --> 01:23:09,196
Grab my stuff. Jesus.

1078
01:23:09,262 --> 01:23:11,532
- Where are we going?
- My cigarettes!

1079
01:23:11,599 --> 01:23:13,575
Where do you think
you're taking me?

1080
01:23:16,751 --> 01:23:18,443
Where's my cigarettes?

1081
01:23:18,512 --> 01:23:20,398
Leave them alone.
Let's just go.

1082
01:23:22,063 --> 01:23:24,813
Come on.
Let's go watch trains.

1083
01:23:40,750 --> 01:23:43,882
You almost lost me there, you know.
Did you see that?

1084
01:23:44,941 --> 01:23:47,363
Jesus. What are we doing here?

1085
01:23:47,437 --> 01:23:49,292
I like to sit out...

1086
01:23:50,510 --> 01:23:52,516
and look at the trains pass.

1087
01:23:52,589 --> 01:23:55,011
Yeah. To each his own, I say.

1088
01:23:55,084 --> 01:23:57,027
I mean, I don't understand it.

1089
01:23:57,101 --> 01:24:00,296
I can make my guitar
sound like a train.

1090
01:24:00,364 --> 01:24:03,180
God! I mean, I'm a nice girl.

1091
01:24:03,245 --> 01:24:05,612
I don't understand
why you'd bring me here.

1092
01:24:05,678 --> 01:24:09,867
I can make my guitar
sound just like a train.

1093
01:24:09,932 --> 01:24:12,998
I got a warm room we can go to.

1094
01:24:13,068 --> 01:24:15,172
Come on. I'll take care of you.

1095
01:24:15,243 --> 01:24:18,178
Come on. It's nice.

1096
01:24:18,252 --> 01:24:22,954
Jesus, I don't understand why you would
bring a nice girl like me out here.

1097
01:24:25,290 --> 01:24:27,232
I'm takin' requests.

1098
01:24:27,307 --> 01:24:29,162
Do you know "Sweet Sue"?

1099
01:26:03,622 --> 01:26:06,337
All right, are you finished?
Can we go now?

1100
01:26:06,405 --> 01:26:09,472
I really have to pee, you know.
I gotta go to the bathroom.

1101
01:26:11,046 --> 01:26:12,704
- What's the matter with you?
- Go on.

1102
01:26:12,774 --> 01:26:14,050
- What?
- Get outta here.

1103
01:26:14,117 --> 01:26:16,604
What? What are you talk...

1104
01:26:16,677 --> 01:26:19,099
- You dragged me out here.
- Just leave me alone.

1105
01:26:19,172 --> 01:26:20,831
- What?
- Leave me alone!

1106
01:26:20,900 --> 01:26:24,162
I don't need anybody!

1107
01:26:24,228 --> 01:26:27,644
- I made a mistake!
- Yeah. I'll say.

1108
01:26:27,717 --> 01:26:29,090
I made mistake!

1109
01:26:56,195 --> 01:26:58,617
I have no idea
what happened to Emmet Ray.

1110
01:26:58,690 --> 01:27:02,203
He just sort of disappeared,
I guess.

1111
01:27:02,274 --> 01:27:04,893
He did make, though,
in those last couple of years...

1112
01:27:04,963 --> 01:27:07,329
he made really
his best recordings.

1113
01:27:07,394 --> 01:27:09,947
He never played more beautifully,
more movingly.

1114
01:27:11,681 --> 01:27:14,016
Something just seemed
to kind of open up in him.

1115
01:27:14,082 --> 01:27:16,832
It was amazing,
because he was, finally...

1116
01:27:16,898 --> 01:27:19,036
every bit as good
as Django Reinhardt.

1117
01:27:19,105 --> 01:27:22,967
And then he just, you know,
seemed to fade away.

1118
01:27:23,041 --> 01:27:24,896
I mean, I have no idea.

1119
01:27:25,889 --> 01:27:27,776
Some people said
he went to Europe.

1120
01:27:27,841 --> 01:27:32,314
And some people feel that he may
have stopped playing altogether.

1121
01:27:32,385 --> 01:27:36,824
But we do have, fortunately,
those last recordings he made.

1122
01:27:39,200 --> 01:27:42,364
And they're great.
They're absolutely beautiful.
