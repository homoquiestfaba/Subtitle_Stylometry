00:00:22,989 --> 00:00:25,299
Woman: My dad would always say,
"Never sell out.

2
00:00:25,325 --> 00:00:27,931
Always put love first.

3
00:00:30,363 --> 00:00:33,901
And if all else fails,
there's always Woodstock."

(alarm clock buzzing )

00:00:51,618 --> 00:00:53,620
-( buzzing stops )
- Oh, God.

6
00:00:53,653 --> 00:00:55,792
Oh, God.

7
00:00:55,822 --> 00:00:59,099
(cries ) Oh, God.
Did you come?

8
00:00:59,125 --> 00:01:01,867
-( Sobbing ) Oh, God.
- Oh...

9
00:01:01,895 --> 00:01:04,501
Oh, God.

10
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:10,080
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

11
00:01:11,771 --> 00:01:13,773
I just always want to
feel so close to you

12
00:01:13,807 --> 00:01:15,844
but I'm really not.

13
00:01:15,875 --> 00:01:17,013
Hmm...

14
00:01:17,043 --> 00:01:20,490
Like you love me and...

15
00:01:20,513 --> 00:01:22,550
like you're listening to me...

16
00:01:24,451 --> 00:01:27,728
- and listening to my bo-- my body.
- Mm-hmm.

17
00:01:32,025 --> 00:01:33,663
I feel like I'm hurting you,

18
00:01:33,693 --> 00:01:36,196
but you're just letting me
hurt you,

19
00:01:36,229 --> 00:01:38,300
( sobbing )
and it's so so sweet!

20
00:01:38,331 --> 00:01:40,242
It's so nice!

21
00:01:41,668 --> 00:01:44,444
I don't want to hurt you,
though.

22
00:01:46,473 --> 00:01:48,714
I mean, I also do, you know?

23
00:01:48,741 --> 00:01:49,811
Yeah, I know.

24
00:01:53,379 --> 00:01:55,859
♪ I pray for sound...♪

25
00:01:57,217 --> 00:02:00,221
Woman: Ever feel like you're
staring at the life you want...

26
00:02:00,253 --> 00:02:03,757
but from too far away
to actually live it,

27
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:07,101
like you're the plagiarized
version of yourself?

28
00:02:07,127 --> 00:02:10,131
My parents died too early
for me to know them.

29
00:02:10,163 --> 00:02:13,838
It's not as tragic as it sounds.
I was fine.

30
00:02:13,867 --> 00:02:16,347
I am... fine.

31
00:02:17,704 --> 00:02:19,081
Why did that war have no heroes?

32
00:02:19,105 --> 00:02:22,314
Because we were too wild and jovial
to know the brutal truths of the fight.

33
00:02:22,342 --> 00:02:25,585
Woman: That is my fiancé,
Garret Brener.

34
00:02:25,612 --> 00:02:29,059
He is an actor.
He is really good.

35
00:02:29,082 --> 00:02:31,562
- He told me himself.
-( clears throat)

36
00:02:31,584 --> 00:02:33,689
I work here,
Abundant Records,

37
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:36,701
where every song sounds better
with a beat.

38
00:02:36,723 --> 00:02:39,829
If you're signed here,
you have a real shot at making it,

39
00:02:39,859 --> 00:02:44,672
a shot at being her,
Jody Sinclair.

40
00:02:44,697 --> 00:02:47,007
My best friend Ryan
is the PR brains behind

41
00:02:47,033 --> 00:02:50,014
the highly grossing
Jody brand.

42
00:02:50,036 --> 00:02:53,074
She got me this gig to get my foot
in the proverbial music door.

43
00:02:54,073 --> 00:02:56,053
She knows how
to handle talent.

44
00:02:57,243 --> 00:02:59,985
And this is me,
Catherine Brown.

45
00:03:00,013 --> 00:03:02,857
The real me is a songwriter.

46
00:03:02,882 --> 00:03:05,624
The real me
is signed at Abundant Records.

47
00:03:05,652 --> 00:03:07,393
The real me wouldn't be
planning a wedding

48
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:09,263
because she hates weddings,

49
00:03:09,289 --> 00:03:10,791
and anyone who takes them
seriously

50
00:03:10,823 --> 00:03:14,828
is a ridiculous person,
but this me,

51
00:03:14,861 --> 00:03:18,138
the me that is actually
living my life...

52
00:03:18,164 --> 00:03:19,643
-( alarm clock buzzing)
- Oh, no, it's so good.

53
00:03:21,801 --> 00:03:23,508
This me is stuck--

54
00:03:23,536 --> 00:03:26,608
stuck at home,
stuck at work...

55
00:03:27,674 --> 00:03:30,154
and stuck with this damn song.

56
00:03:30,176 --> 00:03:32,486
( No voice,
pounding heartbeat)

57
00:03:32,512 --> 00:03:35,015
Oh, yeah.
Lately, I've been doing that.

58
00:03:37,684 --> 00:03:41,188
I don't really know why.
I think it makes me feel better.

59
00:03:41,221 --> 00:03:43,030
Hey, at least I'm not a cutter.

60
00:03:46,593 --> 00:03:48,402
(alarm clock buzzes)

61
00:04:04,944 --> 00:04:07,049
Oh, shit!

62
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,423
Garrett, I am late,

63
00:04:08,448 --> 00:04:11,452
and I molested that little marble man
for a full minute.

64
00:04:12,452 --> 00:04:14,557
That marble man is a De Fontana.
It's worth a fortune.

65
00:04:15,855 --> 00:04:18,392
Oh, God,
my eyes are so blue.

66
00:04:18,424 --> 00:04:19,767
You want to do lunch at noon?

67
00:04:22,195 --> 00:04:23,469
My Eyes...

68
00:04:23,496 --> 00:04:26,443
Uh, no, I can't.
I can't today.

69
00:04:26,466 --> 00:04:28,503
Sorry, babe, therapist.

70
00:04:28,534 --> 00:04:30,275
On a Monday?

71
00:04:30,303 --> 00:04:33,250
Uh-huh.
Twice a week, digging deep.

72
00:04:40,847 --> 00:04:42,292
Have a good morning, Pete.

73
00:04:42,315 --> 00:04:44,056
Thank you, Cath.
You're the best.

74
00:04:49,689 --> 00:04:51,532
Alex Calucas
wants to see you upstairs.

75
00:04:51,557 --> 00:04:53,559
Thanks, Sally.

76
00:04:53,593 --> 00:04:55,539
Turner, hey, um, Turner,

77
00:04:55,561 --> 00:04:57,507
do you know why they want
to see me upstairs?

78
00:04:57,530 --> 00:04:58,565
No, no clue.

79
00:04:58,598 --> 00:05:01,875
- Well, how was the shoot?
- Flipped her shit.

80
00:05:01,901 --> 00:05:03,881
And then she threw
a muffin at Ryan.

81
00:05:03,903 --> 00:05:06,611
What the hell?
What a crazy ass.

82
00:05:08,141 --> 00:05:09,882
And you know how
I feel about carbs.

83
00:05:09,909 --> 00:05:12,116
Okay, she is only
in town for two more days,

84
00:05:12,145 --> 00:05:15,285
just... breathe.

85
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:16,988
The little bitch
doesn't even sing...

86
00:05:17,016 --> 00:05:18,393
Well, yeah, she spins.

87
00:05:18,418 --> 00:05:20,125
Picks a song
and presses play.

88
00:05:20,153 --> 00:05:22,633
- And that wins you a Grammy?
- What can you do?

89
00:05:22,655 --> 00:05:26,660
People are into post-Internet
scene kids and robot dub-step.

90
00:05:26,693 --> 00:05:28,366
Why does Alex
want to see me upstairs?

91
00:05:28,394 --> 00:05:29,896
Maybe they finally listened
to your demo.

92
00:05:29,929 --> 00:05:31,670
- Right.
- Makin' big money.

93
00:05:31,698 --> 00:05:32,870
Absolutely.

94
00:05:32,899 --> 00:05:35,140
- Caitlin!
-( whispers ) Catherine.

95
00:05:35,168 --> 00:05:38,081
Catherine, come on in.
Come on in.

96
00:05:38,104 --> 00:05:39,981
Please, have a seat.

97
00:05:40,006 --> 00:05:42,043
We have some
exciting news for you.

98
00:05:42,075 --> 00:05:44,077
Important and exciting.

99
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:46,147
You are about to win at life.

100
00:05:46,179 --> 00:05:48,955
- You're gonna be a life winner.
- Listen...

101
00:05:50,383 --> 00:05:54,798
we would like for you
to shadow Jody Sinclair.

102
00:05:54,821 --> 00:05:56,357
You're gonna be
her new wrangler.

103
00:05:56,389 --> 00:05:57,595
Wrangler.

104
00:05:57,623 --> 00:05:59,432
- Are you excited?
- You excited?

105
00:05:59,459 --> 00:06:01,370
- Yeah!
- I told you. Great.

106
00:06:01,394 --> 00:06:02,634
See, I love her.

107
00:06:02,662 --> 00:06:04,437
- Great.
- All right, thank you.

108
00:06:04,464 --> 00:06:05,636
Okay. bye-bye-

109
00:06:17,343 --> 00:06:20,722
Um, sorry, um...

110
00:06:20,747 --> 00:06:22,727
what do you mean by wrangle?

111
00:06:22,749 --> 00:06:24,524
Woman:
I can't go out there.

112
00:06:25,551 --> 00:06:26,996
- Woman: One minute.
-( cigarette lighter flicks)

113
00:06:28,154 --> 00:06:29,895
Do you want to talk about it?

114
00:06:29,922 --> 00:06:35,270
How can we talk about the pain
that's in the world right now?

115
00:06:35,294 --> 00:06:38,366
You know, like,
it's just so much.

116
00:06:38,398 --> 00:06:40,275
Sometimes you just don't
know what to do,

117
00:06:40,299 --> 00:06:44,042
and when there's that much pain,
it really gives no meaning

118
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:47,381
to me spinning
my amazing records.

119
00:06:47,407 --> 00:06:49,182
- Yeah.
- And I'm really good.

120
00:06:49,208 --> 00:06:50,915
And I wish I could help them.

121
00:06:50,943 --> 00:06:52,217
Let me help you out.

122
00:06:52,245 --> 00:06:54,851
Here we go.
It's gonna be okay.

123
00:06:54,881 --> 00:06:56,326
- No...
- Yeah, well,

124
00:06:56,349 --> 00:06:58,556
- I don't want to go.
- Oh, you're not going, okay.

125
00:06:58,584 --> 00:07:01,724
Oh, I'm gonna get you
on the floor then.

126
00:07:01,754 --> 00:07:05,258
Let's just get on the stage
and then we can keep--

127
00:07:05,291 --> 00:07:07,168
. Drag me gently.
- Okay.

128
00:07:07,193 --> 00:07:08,797
This is a vintage McQueen.

129
00:07:08,828 --> 00:07:10,671
I'm sorry
if it's gonna get torn.

130
00:07:10,696 --> 00:07:12,801
I don't really want to mess up
your clothes.

131
00:07:12,832 --> 00:07:16,507
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- This is... kind of romantic.

132
00:07:21,407 --> 00:07:22,977
(sighs)

133
00:07:35,254 --> 00:07:37,063
Catherine:
My dad produced that album

134
00:07:37,089 --> 00:07:40,002
and my mother sang
some of the vocals.

135
00:07:40,026 --> 00:07:42,506
I walk by this store front
every day,

136
00:07:42,528 --> 00:07:46,271
and I think about that drive
and that Woodstock house,

137
00:07:46,299 --> 00:07:48,540
and the box
with my mom's wedding dress...

138
00:07:50,503 --> 00:07:53,074
and my dad's lucky quill
that I buried

139
00:07:53,105 --> 00:07:55,051
under the fourth tree
from the porch.

140
00:07:58,044 --> 00:07:59,352
( Sniffles )

141
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:05,494
Can you believe this?

142
00:08:08,855 --> 00:08:10,300
Thank you.

143
00:08:12,024 --> 00:08:13,401
- Catherine.
- Sally.

144
00:08:13,426 --> 00:08:15,235
They want to see you
upstairs again.

145
00:08:15,261 --> 00:08:17,207
Oh, probably getting a bonus.

146
00:08:17,230 --> 00:08:18,402
Fired?!

147
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:20,206
We never said
to physically assault her.

148
00:08:20,233 --> 00:08:22,110
Yeah, "wrangle" wasn't literal.

149
00:08:22,134 --> 00:08:24,205
I was pulling, not assaulting,
pulling.

150
00:08:24,237 --> 00:08:26,183
Pulling, assaulting,
who knows the difference?

151
00:08:26,205 --> 00:08:27,513
She felt violated.

152
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:29,645
She said it was either you
or her.

153
00:08:29,675 --> 00:08:32,519
Yeah, and we chose her,
obviously.

154
00:08:32,545 --> 00:08:35,151
Wait, I got her there
just like you said.

155
00:08:35,181 --> 00:08:37,593
Alex: Your actions jeopardized
the biggest client

156
00:08:37,617 --> 00:08:38,823
we have at this label.

157
00:08:38,851 --> 00:08:41,263
Your bad decisions
almost made me almost fire Ron.

158
00:08:41,287 --> 00:08:42,425
What?

159
00:08:43,856 --> 00:08:45,927
It's clear-your-desk time,
Catherine.

160
00:08:52,298 --> 00:08:54,107
I want to thank you
for this opportunity

161
00:08:54,133 --> 00:08:56,079
and let you know
that I have a bruise on my hip

162
00:08:56,102 --> 00:08:57,604
because of
last night's assignment,

163
00:08:57,637 --> 00:08:59,617
and I was the one assaulted,

164
00:08:59,639 --> 00:09:02,142
and I was the one abused,
but I will be fine,

165
00:09:02,174 --> 00:09:03,847
because that is just what I do

166
00:09:03,876 --> 00:09:06,914
when things are not... fine.

167
00:09:06,946 --> 00:09:11,224
I just- I... make them fine.

168
00:09:23,062 --> 00:09:25,508
Were you...
were you really going to fire me?

169
00:09:25,531 --> 00:09:27,204
- No.
- Yeah.

170
00:09:42,048 --> 00:09:44,221
(sighs)

171
00:09:46,352 --> 00:09:48,525
(shower running )

172
00:09:59,799 --> 00:10:01,745
( gasps )
- ( telephone ringing )

173
00:10:11,143 --> 00:10:12,213
Garret?

174
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:20,056
. Baby, the way
you look at me...

175
00:10:20,086 --> 00:10:21,326
Hey.

176
00:10:21,354 --> 00:10:23,231
Catherine... um--

177
00:10:23,255 --> 00:10:24,757
Bonjour.

178
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:28,260
Bonjour? Wh..

179
00:10:28,294 --> 00:10:30,103
This is--
this is not what it looks like.

180
00:10:30,129 --> 00:10:31,972
- Yeah?
- I know it looks really bad,

181
00:10:31,998 --> 00:10:34,877
and it's a version of what
it looks like, but it's not this.

182
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:38,109
- It's much more innocent than--
- Therapist, Garret?

183
00:10:38,137 --> 00:10:41,846
Well, I should have known
that "digging deep" was literal.

184
00:10:41,874 --> 00:10:44,616
Uh, this is Sylvia.
She's my-- she's my dialect coach.

185
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:47,818
And she-- she was helping me
with some vowel sounds

186
00:10:47,847 --> 00:10:49,417
the director said
that I needed help on.

187
00:10:49,448 --> 00:10:50,825
- Vowel sounds?
- Okay, Catherine,

188
00:10:50,850 --> 00:10:52,329
just listen to me
for one second.

189
00:10:52,351 --> 00:10:55,059
(sighs ) She showed me
a scar that she has on her leg

190
00:10:55,087 --> 00:10:57,192
from a horseback riding accident
when she was five,

191
00:10:57,223 --> 00:10:58,896
and she said it makes her
feel ugly,

192
00:10:58,924 --> 00:11:01,928
and so all I was trying to do
is convince this broken girl

193
00:11:01,961 --> 00:11:03,338
that she was okay.

194
00:11:03,362 --> 00:11:04,705
What am I supposed to do?

195
00:11:04,730 --> 00:11:07,370
Anyway, the point is
I don't know how I got here.

196
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:09,505
I really don't know I got here.
Why are you here?

197
00:11:09,535 --> 00:11:11,071
Why aren't you at work?

198
00:11:11,103 --> 00:11:12,844
I...

199
00:11:12,872 --> 00:11:14,408
was...

200
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:15,510
fired!

201
00:11:17,309 --> 00:11:19,016
Ooh! God!

202
00:11:19,045 --> 00:11:21,082
Oh, she got me right...

203
00:11:21,113 --> 00:11:22,956

( Strangled breath )

212
00:11:47,206 --> 00:11:50,449
Really,
this song is about um--

213
00:11:50,476 --> 00:11:53,320
it's about this-- the monster

214
00:11:53,345 --> 00:11:55,848
that was living
under my bed as a child.

215
00:11:55,881 --> 00:11:57,121
Man: You're joking.

216
00:11:57,149 --> 00:11:58,958
No, I'm not--
I'm not joking.

217
00:11:58,984 --> 00:12:00,554
What?

218
00:12:00,586 --> 00:12:02,429
Jody: He was my mate,
but I also feared him.

219
00:12:02,455 --> 00:12:06,267
This song is like a love song,
but, like, also like a dream

220
00:12:06,292 --> 00:12:08,033
of somebody
in a mental institution.

221
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:10,472
Is anybody
watching this disaster?

222
00:12:10,496 --> 00:12:12,066
Man: What would you like to say
to your fans?

223
00:12:12,098 --> 00:12:13,975
I don't really like
to call them my fans.

224
00:12:13,999 --> 00:12:15,910
I want to call them my friends.

225
00:12:15,935 --> 00:12:17,005
I hate you.

226
00:12:17,036 --> 00:12:19,949
We're all one,
but I would die without them.

227
00:12:19,972 --> 00:12:21,076
You should be dead.

228
00:12:21,107 --> 00:12:23,951
Yeah, it's ironic, you know,
that's why I do what I do.

229
00:12:23,976 --> 00:12:25,887
- Cath?
- Yo.

230
00:12:25,911 --> 00:12:30,451
I'm not-- I'm not just a deejay.
I'm a rhythm poet.

231
00:12:30,483 --> 00:12:33,362
Hey!
No, I was watching that.

232
00:12:33,385 --> 00:12:36,559
You look crazy, right now.
You are a crazy lady.

233
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:37,966
That's it.

234
00:12:37,990 --> 00:12:40,527
One week is enough time
to mope around.

235
00:12:40,559 --> 00:12:42,004
- Up we go.
- No.

236
00:12:42,027 --> 00:12:44,029
We're going out, yes.
Come.

237
00:12:44,063 --> 00:12:46,703
Dr. Phil said I'm a codependent.

238
00:12:46,732 --> 00:12:50,612
Okay, first of all,
never trust a bald man.

239
00:12:50,636 --> 00:12:52,775
I learned that the hard way,
and second of all,

240
00:12:52,805 --> 00:12:54,409
psychology is like the horoscope.

241
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:55,851
We're going out.

242
00:12:55,875 --> 00:12:59,550
I am never going near
a man again, not even a...

243
00:12:59,578 --> 00:13:03,116
I will not be a codependent
astrologer!

244
00:13:03,149 --> 00:13:05,186
That's fine.
Okay, now wash your face.

245
00:13:05,217 --> 00:13:07,219
(groans ) Fine!

246
00:13:09,155 --> 00:13:12,159
Oh, my God.
You are so fun.

247
00:13:13,159 --> 00:13:15,070
Garret, ugh, he was not fun.

248
00:13:15,094 --> 00:13:19,406
He was one of those artistic types--
super needy and blah.

249
00:13:19,431 --> 00:13:20,671
- Ugh.
- Who's Garret?

250
00:13:20,699 --> 00:13:22,474
I don't know.
( laughs )

251
00:13:22,501 --> 00:13:24,378
. Hey-
. Hey-

252
00:13:24,403 --> 00:13:26,349
- Hi.
- Hi.

253
00:13:26,372 --> 00:13:28,784
- I'm Ryan.
- This is Ryan.

254
00:13:28,808 --> 00:13:30,014
It's nice to meet you.

255
00:13:31,577 --> 00:13:33,420
Yeah, we have to go,
like, right now.

256
00:13:33,445 --> 00:13:34,856
- Why? No, I'm having fun.
- Hi.

257
00:13:38,117 --> 00:13:40,563
It's good to
see that you're alive.

258
00:13:42,154 --> 00:13:45,135
- What's up?
- Not much.

259
00:13:45,157 --> 00:13:47,433
- Hello, Ryan.
- Don't speak to us.

260
00:13:47,459 --> 00:13:49,564
I'm gonna make an effort
to be nice.

261
00:13:49,595 --> 00:13:52,474
Oh, you know what, Garret,
I'm actually really happy

262
00:13:52,498 --> 00:13:55,035
that you're here
because I wanted to introduce you

263
00:13:55,067 --> 00:13:56,740
to my new man, Dylan.

264
00:13:56,769 --> 00:13:58,009
- New man?
- What?

265
00:13:58,037 --> 00:13:59,675
Dylan, Garret, Garret, Dylan.

266
00:13:59,705 --> 00:14:01,651
It's-- we can all just--

267
00:14:03,275 --> 00:14:04,913
- Are you crazy?!
- What the hell, man?!

268
00:14:04,944 --> 00:14:06,218
- Are you crazy?
- What are you doing?

269
00:14:06,245 --> 00:14:08,247
I was lying, you animal.

270
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:10,351
- I was trying to make you--
- Why would you lie to me?

271
00:14:10,382 --> 00:14:12,521
You should not lie to people.
Look what you made me do.

272
00:14:12,551 --> 00:14:14,997
- You're an asshole.
- Ow, Ryan, real mature.

273
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:18,058
- You need some ice.
- Oh, God.

274
00:14:18,090 --> 00:14:19,501
What?

275
00:14:20,759 --> 00:14:22,705
You know what?
I think you're right.

276
00:14:22,728 --> 00:14:25,072
I think maybe we should
have some time apart.

277
00:14:25,097 --> 00:14:27,577
I can't do this right now.
This is crazy.

278
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:31,275
I can't have this kind of press.
I'm punching people.

279
00:14:31,303 --> 00:14:32,714
Yeah...

280
00:14:42,915 --> 00:14:44,826
Look who's got it together.

281
00:14:48,721 --> 00:14:50,223
I'm moving to Woodstock.

282
00:14:52,725 --> 00:14:54,796
What?

283
00:14:54,827 --> 00:14:56,670
This is the house I grew up in

284
00:14:56,695 --> 00:14:58,902
and this whole time,
I forgot I had this option.

285
00:14:58,931 --> 00:15:00,410
I mean, I haven't been there
in 20 years,

286
00:15:00,432 --> 00:15:02,378
but I do technically
own this place.

287
00:15:03,435 --> 00:15:05,472
- Is this about last night?
- No.

288
00:15:06,672 --> 00:15:08,276
And what are you gonna
do there alone?

289
00:15:08,307 --> 00:15:10,583
Write music...

290
00:15:10,609 --> 00:15:13,954
and do crafts, which I love.

291
00:15:15,781 --> 00:15:18,159
You're moving
to Woodstock by yourself

292
00:15:18,183 --> 00:15:20,493
to a house you haven't seen
since you were four,

293
00:15:20,519 --> 00:15:24,023
with no one there that you know
so you could write and do crafts.

294
00:15:24,056 --> 00:15:25,364
Yes.

295
00:15:30,462 --> 00:15:32,339
What?

296
00:15:32,364 --> 00:15:34,275
- This is a horrible idea.
. Hey“

297
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:36,541
Last night was supposed
to be about you getting out

298
00:15:36,568 --> 00:15:38,104
of the house,
getting some fresh air

299
00:15:38,137 --> 00:15:40,378
because you spent a whole week
on that damn couch,

300
00:15:40,406 --> 00:15:43,717
and you looked like this tiny,
little Prozac commercial all curled up.

301
00:15:45,611 --> 00:15:47,682
And we know this about you.

302
00:15:47,713 --> 00:15:49,090
You run from things.

303
00:15:49,114 --> 00:15:50,718
I am not running away
from anything.

304
00:15:52,718 --> 00:15:56,393
I'm running to something.
And I have laundry.

305
00:16:16,675 --> 00:16:18,382
So my dad called this morning,

306
00:16:18,410 --> 00:16:21,323
asked me if I wanted to meet
Shelly again.

307
00:16:21,347 --> 00:16:23,884
Said it's important.
He said it's mature.

308
00:16:23,916 --> 00:16:26,192
He said that she means
everything to him...

309
00:16:28,253 --> 00:16:31,427
and we wonder why I sleep
around so much?

310
00:16:31,457 --> 00:16:33,630
We know this about him, okay?

311
00:16:33,659 --> 00:16:35,605
He doesn't know how to protect
your feelings.

312
00:16:35,627 --> 00:16:37,334
You just have to do it yourself.

313
00:16:39,398 --> 00:16:40,468
You're gonna be fine.

314
00:16:40,499 --> 00:16:43,378
Ooh, I'm gonna be--
mm, ooh, super fine.

315
00:16:45,704 --> 00:16:47,274
Come here.

316
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:51,113
(sighs)

317
00:16:51,143 --> 00:16:53,521
Let's pawn this bitch
and get me a car.

318
00:16:54,913 --> 00:16:57,757
Catherine: Woodstock, New York,
is exactly one hour, 55 minutes

319
00:16:57,783 --> 00:16:59,023
from the city.

320
00:16:59,051 --> 00:17:00,894
You take
the George Washington Bridge

321
00:17:00,919 --> 00:17:04,264
over the Palisades Parkway,
then west on route 23,

322
00:17:04,289 --> 00:17:06,860
and right onto route 33...

323
00:17:08,427 --> 00:17:09,804
and you're there.

324
00:17:11,897 --> 00:17:16,676
In Woodstock, you can plant
a daisy and out pops a rose.

325
00:17:16,702 --> 00:17:18,272
Even the soil here is creative.

326
00:17:19,271 --> 00:17:22,218
Historically, a town full of legends,

327
00:17:22,241 --> 00:17:26,121
all these romantic nomad people
who were always drawn

328
00:17:26,145 --> 00:17:30,821
to this one town,
this beautiful, creative spot,

329
00:17:30,849 --> 00:17:35,229
this Mecca, and I was going
back there to be an artist,

330
00:17:35,254 --> 00:17:38,565
to become the singer
I'd always hoped to be.

331
00:17:38,590 --> 00:17:42,834
Back to this rich,
powerful, creative Mecca.

Uh, one more, please.

- Seriously?
- Yeah, seriously, and a beer.

345
00:18:57,836 --> 00:18:59,941
You know, I should be--

346
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:04,213
I should be feeling
good right now.

that it is in the folk family.

are just covered in red wine.

And so Ryan looks at me
and she goes,

670
00:43:35,312 --> 00:43:38,259
"Hey, do you know
the one with two sailors

671
00:43:38,282 --> 00:43:40,558
who go out to sea
and get covered in red wine?"

672

I knew that one.

673
00:43:44,021 --> 00:43:46,399

that we could laugh

674
00:43:46,423 --> 00:43:47,766
at the same things,

675
00:43:47,791 --> 00:43:51,261
and so she's-- she's family.

676
00:43:52,496 --> 00:43:54,305
And you've no other family?

677
00:43:57,334 --> 00:44:01,111
Not-- not anyone
close enough to count.

678
00:44:02,272 --> 00:44:03,842
And Ryan got you
the job at Abundant?

679
00:44:04,975 --> 00:44:07,546
Is this gonna be

Trust me.
I have my reasons.

. No, I really don't think so...

701
00:45:02,466 --> 00:45:03,843
It feels good, man.

702
00:45:03,867 --> 00:45:05,608
- I'm feeling it.
- Ron: Yes, I'm feeling it.

703
00:45:05,636 --> 00:45:08,310
- It's like this that hippie hit.
- We've hit the nail on the head.

704
00:45:08,338 --> 00:45:11,911
Kudos.
Not you.

705
00:45:11,942 --> 00:45:13,114
Bam, we did good.

706
00:45:13,143 --> 00:45:15,350
- Good job.
- Good job.

707
00:45:15,379 --> 00:45:17,791
So, uh... so you--

708
00:45:17,815 --> 00:45:19,419
you seeing anyone
at the moment, Ryan?

709
00:45:19,450 --> 00:45:21,862
Can you stop breathing on me?
Thank you.

710
00:45:21,885 --> 00:45:24,832

711
00:45:32,563 --> 00:45:35,043
Oh, you're closed, sorry.

712
00:45:35,065 --> 00:45:38,979
Oh, hi, Catherine.
You want some coffee?

713
00:45:39,002 --> 00:45:41,004
Oh, no, no.

714
00:45:42,272 --> 00:45:43,478
So what do you do?

715
00:45:43,507 --> 00:45:46,579
Oh, I'm a singer
and a songwriter.

716
00:45:46,610 --> 00:45:48,612
- I think.
- You think?

717
00:45:48,645 --> 00:45:51,091
Yeah, well, I'll know
when I write something brilliant

718
00:45:51,115 --> 00:45:52,753
and people listen to it.

719
00:45:52,783 --> 00:45:55,889
"Brilliant."
Kind of overrated.

720
00:45:55,919 --> 00:45:59,230
Yeah, I've actually been having
a really hard time writing.

721
00:45:59,256 --> 00:46:02,260
And I'm just
not censoring myself,

722
00:46:02,292 --> 00:46:04,704
and the thing that I really
like about your music

723
00:46:04,728 --> 00:46:08,642
is your lyrics, how sly they are,
how smart they are,

724
00:46:08,665 --> 00:46:11,339
just- the song is so much cooler

725
00:46:11,368 --> 00:46:13,006
than whoever"; listening to it.

726
00:46:13,036 --> 00:46:17,883
It's just totally--
um, it's totally uncensored.

727
00:46:17,908 --> 00:46:20,047
Well, thank you.
That's sweet.

728
00:46:20,077 --> 00:46:22,717
You know my dad used to listen
to your music all the time?

729
00:46:22,746 --> 00:46:25,283
He'd sit out on the front porch
and play your album.

730
00:46:25,315 --> 00:46:27,420
Yeah.

731
00:46:27,451 --> 00:46:30,660
Well, we wrote some songs
together, your dad and I.

732
00:46:30,687 --> 00:46:33,224
- You did?
- Yes, we did.

733
00:46:33,257 --> 00:46:35,396
I knew there was a reason
I was looking for you.

734
00:46:35,425 --> 00:46:38,463
Well, why don't you come by
one night after we close?

735
00:46:38,495 --> 00:46:41,442
I'll give you some pointers,
help you with those lyrics.

736
00:46:41,465 --> 00:46:43,172
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

737
00:47:20,904 --> 00:47:22,941
It's still here.

738
00:47:38,422 --> 00:47:40,424

740
00:47:58,475 --> 00:48:01,615
Hey, Mr. Harmon
is gonna kill you.

741
00:48:01,645 --> 00:48:03,181
He'll leave it up eventually.

742
00:48:03,213 --> 00:48:04,749
- Mm-hmm.
- Yes, he will.

743
00:48:04,781 --> 00:48:08,456
So what happened the other night?
You left so fast.

744
00:48:08,485 --> 00:48:12,194
Nothing.
I mean... nothing at all.

745
00:48:13,323 --> 00:48:16,930
It was really nice.
Noah's, uh... very nice.

746
00:48:19,296 --> 00:48:21,537
Apparently, he's boning
a Namibian model.

So he's that guy.

748
00:48:25,569 --> 00:48:27,981
I just wanted you to know.

749
00:48:28,005 --> 00:48:30,315
- Hmm.
- I'm just saying you should be careful.

750
00:48:31,341 --> 00:48:32,843

01:05:41,170 --> 01:05:44,174
We took your song
and pumped it up a little bit,

1031
01:05:44,206 --> 01:05:47,415
put a little beat behind it.
and immediately...

1032
01:05:47,443 --> 01:05:49,753
- I saw fragrance.
- Oh, yeah, fragrance.

1033
01:05:49,779 --> 01:05:51,486

01:06:20,009 --> 01:06:22,421
See?
A-mazing, huh?

1047
01:06:22,445 --> 01:06:24,118
( Catherine singing indistinctly
behind music )

1048
01:06:33,656 --> 01:06:35,363
Just one moment.

1049
01:06:45,701 --> 01:06:47,806
( No voice, heartbeat )

1050
01:06:53,342 --> 01:06:55,583
(sighs)

1051
01:06:55,611 --> 01:06:57,284
( music continues)

1052
01:06:58,781 --> 01:06:59,987
I love it.

1053
01:07:02,651 --> 01:07:04,324
Let me play you the new stuff.

1054
01:07:12,028 --> 01:07:14,599
Catherine, hey, can we talk?

1055
01:07:14,630 --> 01:07:16,200
- No.
- Please, please.

1056
01:07:16,232 --> 01:07:18,508
- No way, no.
- Please just don't walk away.

1057
01:07:18,534 --> 01:07:20,571
How did you even know
that I was here?

1058
01:07:20,603 --> 01:07:22,276
Sally.

1059
01:07:22,304 --> 01:07:23,374
Sally.

1060
01:07:23,406 --> 01:07:25,784
It's good to see you.

1061
01:07:27,610 --> 01:07:31,990
Can we just go get a glass
of wine and just... please?

1062
01:07:33,049 --> 01:07:35,120
Just one little glass.

1063
01:07:35,151 --> 01:07:37,153
- You know, no.
- Just to talk.

1064
01:07:37,186 --> 01:07:39,291
You know what,
I have this thing tonight in Woodstock

1065
01:07:39,321 --> 01:07:41,665
and I was supposed
to go say hi to Ryan,

1066
01:07:41,690 --> 01:07:43,533
and, shit, I don't want
to go back in there.

1067
01:07:43,559 --> 01:07:45,630
Listen, look, look at you.

1068
01:07:45,661 --> 01:07:47,265
Look how stressed out you are.

1069
01:07:55,571 --> 01:07:57,847
Let's just go focus on you
for one night.

1070
01:07:58,874 --> 01:08:00,478
Come on.

1071
01:08:07,917 --> 01:08:09,828
Oh, God, I real-- I miss this,

1072
01:08:09,852 --> 01:08:12,128
like, being open with you

1073
01:08:12,154 --> 01:08:15,692
and I'm just being
so open with somebody.

1074
01:08:15,724 --> 01:08:18,227
You're not open
with your French girl?

1075
01:08:21,197 --> 01:08:23,302
I think I need to go
into treatment, like a rehab.

1076
01:08:23,332 --> 01:08:24,470
I-I...

1077
01:08:25,835 --> 01:08:27,781
I think I'm a sex addict.

1078
01:08:27,803 --> 01:08:31,216
I need to curb this thing in me
that just wants to sabotage things

1079
01:08:31,240 --> 01:08:34,016
and have sex with them
and just be gluttonous

1080
01:08:34,043 --> 01:08:35,784
'cause I think
have boundary issues,

1081
01:08:35,811 --> 01:08:38,655
and I-- I--
I think I-- you know what?

1082
01:08:38,681 --> 01:08:40,524
I think I want
to be gluten-free,

1083
01:08:40,549 --> 01:08:43,155
and I just want to change
everything about myself

1084
01:08:43,185 --> 01:08:46,962
so you won't even recognize me,
and I'll do that today,

1085
01:08:46,989 --> 01:08:49,765
I will change everything...
right now.

1086
01:08:49,792 --> 01:08:51,237
I mean it.

1087
01:08:53,062 --> 01:08:54,803
Where- where's your ring?

1088
01:08:58,634 --> 01:09:00,079
I sold it.

1089
01:09:01,270 --> 01:09:02,271
You...

1090
01:09:04,273 --> 01:09:07,948
Well, I deser-- I deserve that,
but here's the thing, Cat.

1091
01:09:07,977 --> 01:09:09,615
Ten years is ten years,

1092
01:09:09,645 --> 01:09:11,989
and things were getting weird
between us.

1093
01:09:12,014 --> 01:09:14,893
You know, and I messed up.

1094
01:09:14,917 --> 01:09:16,919
Everyone messes up.
You make mistakes.

1095
01:09:16,952 --> 01:09:21,458
Okay, I made bigger mistakes,
but... Catherine,

1096
01:09:21,490 --> 01:09:24,835
you know that we always
come back to each other.

1097
01:09:24,860 --> 01:09:25,895
You know we do,

1098
01:09:25,928 --> 01:09:27,965
and I have always
been here for you.

1099
01:09:27,997 --> 01:09:30,136
I know everything
about everything about you.

1100
01:09:30,166 --> 01:09:31,736
Doesn't that mean something?

1101
01:09:31,767 --> 01:09:33,804
And I... ( sighs)

1102
01:09:33,836 --> 01:09:37,306
I mean, I'm an idiot,
but I'm your idiot.

1103
01:09:39,074 --> 01:09:40,985
And your idiots
are hard to come by.

1104
01:09:50,753 --> 01:09:51,959
Tell me.

1105
01:09:56,058 --> 01:09:57,503
( Vibrates )

1106
01:10:37,266 --> 01:10:39,906
Oh, where is my phone?
Come on.

1107
01:10:45,774 --> 01:10:48,482
(door bell rings)

1108
01:10:48,510 --> 01:10:53,892
Lee Ann, lam so sorry.
I just have a lot going on.

1109
01:10:53,916 --> 01:10:55,896
And I was in the city
and Abundant Records

1110
01:10:55,918 --> 01:10:57,829
wants to sign me,
but they ruined my song.

1111
01:10:57,853 --> 01:10:59,662
- Abundant Records?
- Garret showed up.

1112
01:10:59,688 --> 01:11:02,897
- That's where you were?
-( sighs ) It's a long story.

1113
01:11:02,925 --> 01:11:04,962
I just- last night
was not working out for me.

1114
01:11:04,994 --> 01:11:07,702
That's what I've been helping
you write for,

1115
01:11:07,730 --> 01:11:09,767
that horrible sell-out company?

1116
01:11:11,300 --> 01:11:13,678
See, this is why
I didn't want to tell you,

1117
01:11:13,702 --> 01:11:15,613
because I thought
that you would react like this.

1118
01:11:15,638 --> 01:11:17,845
That company is pretty major.

1119
01:11:17,873 --> 01:11:21,514
Did you forget how they
fired you without a glance?

1120
01:11:21,543 --> 01:11:23,216
They make music
that you hate.

1121
01:11:24,480 --> 01:11:26,153
Well, maybe I don't care.

1122
01:11:26,181 --> 01:11:27,455
You don't care
about your work?

1123
01:11:27,483 --> 01:11:29,292
Yeah, maybe I want to sell out.

1124
01:11:29,318 --> 01:11:31,525
Maybe I want to stop trying
so hard.

1125
01:11:31,553 --> 01:11:33,965
Honey... you are so much better

1126
01:11:33,989 --> 01:11:35,798
than what just came out
of your mouth.

1127
01:11:36,892 --> 01:11:39,736
I should just go back to the city.
I don't belong here.

1128
01:11:39,762 --> 01:11:42,299
Wherever you go,
you take yourself with you.

1129
01:11:42,331 --> 01:11:44,743
You think the gauge
for not trying so hard

1130
01:11:44,767 --> 01:11:47,407
is that it feels easy?

1131
01:11:47,436 --> 01:11:48,847
Well, you're wrong.

1132
01:11:50,506 --> 01:11:52,713
Yeah, says the woman
who won't sing in public anymore

1133
01:11:52,741 --> 01:11:56,348
'cause some guy told her that
her voice quivers on the wrong octave.

1134
01:11:56,378 --> 01:11:58,551
Oh, yeah.

1135
01:11:58,580 --> 01:12:01,117
Right, yeah, you're right.

1136
01:12:01,150 --> 01:12:04,461
Who am I to lecture you
on good choices?

1137
01:12:06,388 --> 01:12:07,833
For the record...

1138
01:12:09,091 --> 01:12:11,435
I went out on the line for you.

1139
01:12:16,598 --> 01:12:18,043
You should go back to the city.

1140
01:12:19,968 --> 01:12:21,413
You don't belong here.

1141
01:12:41,857 --> 01:12:43,894
( Sobbing )

1142
01:13:16,058 --> 01:13:16,424
( knocks on door)

1143
01:13:16,425 --> 01:13:18,063
( knocks on door)

1144
01:13:18,093 --> 01:13:20,369
- Catherine.
- Hi.

1145
01:13:20,396 --> 01:13:22,603
Hi,
I thought you were in Woodstock.

1146
01:13:22,631 --> 01:13:23,632
I was.

1147
01:13:23,665 --> 01:13:28,774
I just had an awful 24 hours,
and I really do miss something.

1148
01:13:28,804 --> 01:13:31,307
I don't know what.
I just- I need a hug.

1149
01:13:31,340 --> 01:13:33,946
I don't know if that's right
or whatever, but I just need a hug.

1150
01:13:33,976 --> 01:13:37,719
- Can you just hug me for like--
- Yeah, of course, come here.

1151
01:13:37,746 --> 01:13:39,987
Oh, why are you--
why are you greasy?

1152
01:13:41,517 --> 01:13:45,590
Oh, I, um... uh, it's...

1153
01:13:45,621 --> 01:13:47,259
. I..
- Garret?

1154
01:13:47,289 --> 01:13:49,462
- What?
- Why are you greasy?

1155
01:13:49,491 --> 01:13:52,802
It's a, uh, it's oil,
and it-- I don't know.

1156
01:13:52,828 --> 01:13:54,432
You're supposed to--
it's supposed to like sort of--

1157
01:13:54,463 --> 01:13:56,170
no, no,
Catherine, don't go in there!

1158
01:13:56,198 --> 01:13:57,700
We were never officially
back together.

1159
01:13:57,733 --> 01:14:00,270
Oh, come on!

1160
01:14:00,302 --> 01:14:02,282
Um, you remember.
This is Sylvia.

1161
01:14:02,304 --> 01:14:04,944
And this is her very
close friend, Matilde.

1162
01:14:05,941 --> 01:14:08,046
Sorry, can you leave us alone
for a second?

1163
01:14:11,680 --> 01:14:13,785
Catherine,
it's all out of con--

1164
01:14:14,983 --> 01:14:16,860
Don't you dare.
Give it to me.

1165
01:14:16,885 --> 01:14:18,922
I implore you to hand me
that marble man statue

1166
01:14:18,954 --> 01:14:21,366
because it's a De Fontana,
and it's insanely expensive.

1167
01:14:21,390 --> 01:14:23,063
Don't, don't, please, please.
please, please, please, please.

1168
01:14:23,091 --> 01:14:24,365
- It's my lucky charm.
- Going down.

1169
01:14:24,393 --> 01:14:26,532
And every part I get,
I rub him on top of his head!

1170
01:14:26,562 --> 01:14:28,303
Please, don't! No!

1171
01:14:28,330 --> 01:14:30,139
- No?
- Okay, Catherine, Catherine.

1172
01:14:30,165 --> 01:14:32,771
Good, you...
keep control, okay?

1173
01:14:32,801 --> 01:14:35,111
Let's just be reasonable here,
all right.

1174
01:14:35,137 --> 01:14:36,980
What are you doing?
No, no, no!

1175
01:14:37,005 --> 01:14:38,678
Don't, don't--
no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!

1176
01:14:44,880 --> 01:14:46,382
You chopped
his little penis off?

1177
01:14:46,415 --> 01:14:49,328
Yeah, it's called retribution,
Garret.

1178
01:14:49,351 --> 01:14:51,353
You chopped
his little penis off.

1179
01:14:51,386 --> 01:14:54,026
Just be happy
I wasn't being literal.

1180
01:14:56,658 --> 01:14:57,830
Ryan:
"Very good friend"?

1181
01:14:57,860 --> 01:15:01,433
Yes, and the whole place
is just covered in, like, baby oil,

1182
01:15:01,463 --> 01:15:05,309
and Noah is with this tall,
Namibian lady

1183
01:15:05,334 --> 01:15:06,904
and Lee Ann is...

1184
01:15:06,935 --> 01:15:09,745
You know what, Catherine?
I can't be here for you right now.

1185
01:15:10,939 --> 01:15:12,213
Why not?

1186
01:15:12,241 --> 01:15:15,484
Do you know that I called you
seven times last week

1187
01:15:15,511 --> 01:15:19,459
and then waited for four hours
for you to stop by after your meeting?

1188
01:15:19,481 --> 01:15:23,486
I was having one of the most
important weeks of my life.

1189
01:15:23,519 --> 01:15:25,328
Yeah, well, so was I.

1190
01:15:25,354 --> 01:15:26,890
Oh, right, right,

1191
01:15:26,922 --> 01:15:30,699
because the world cannot
revolve around me for just a second.

1192
01:15:31,727 --> 01:15:34,503
What?
Are you a mental?

1193
01:15:34,530 --> 01:15:37,875
The world's axis
sits on your tiny, little person

1194
01:15:37,900 --> 01:15:41,746
and spins out of control
and all I do is clean up your mess,

1195
01:15:41,770 --> 01:15:44,148
your constant emotional mess.

1196
01:15:44,172 --> 01:15:47,381
Oh, wow, whoa, what a joke!

1197
01:15:47,409 --> 01:15:49,047
I am an emotional mess?

1198
01:15:49,077 --> 01:15:51,455
You're obsessive
and sleep around so much,

1199
01:15:51,480 --> 01:15:52,925
I have lost penis count.

1200
01:15:52,948 --> 01:15:54,120
You know what?

1201
01:15:54,149 --> 01:15:57,062
I don't give a shit
what you think about me.

1202
01:15:57,085 --> 01:15:59,258
I am no mental
when lam standing across

1203
01:15:59,288 --> 01:16:03,236
from the single most insane,
wildly inappropriate,

1204
01:16:03,258 --> 01:16:06,535
just downright wrong person
I've ever met.

1205
01:16:09,298 --> 01:16:11,437
I'm pregnant.

1206
01:16:13,735 --> 01:16:15,146
Of course you are.

1207
01:16:16,672 --> 01:16:18,652
- Get out.
- Great.

1208
01:16:24,012 --> 01:16:26,288
And I hate your baby.

1209
01:16:36,358 --> 01:16:41,899
(screams)

1210
01:16:53,075 --> 01:16:55,316
( grunts ) Don't-- ow...

1211
01:16:55,344 --> 01:16:58,518
Ow, stop, stop.
Stop.

1212
01:16:58,547 --> 01:16:59,617
(groans ) Ow!

1213
01:16:59,648 --> 01:17:02,822
Jesus, dude,
I thought you were dead.

1214
01:17:02,851 --> 01:17:05,161
I mean, you look all cracked out
and dead right now.

1215
01:17:05,187 --> 01:17:07,394
I feel like a version of that.

1216
01:17:07,422 --> 01:17:09,766
What the hell happened to you?

1217
01:17:09,791 --> 01:17:14,297
Um... I failed at life.
Everybody hates me.

1218
01:17:14,329 --> 01:17:16,809
I'm about to sell out
to Abundant tomorrow.

1219
01:17:20,502 --> 01:17:21,708
Catherine?

1220
01:17:24,272 --> 01:17:25,649
I'm dying.

1221
01:17:26,842 --> 01:17:28,014
What?

1222
01:17:31,413 --> 01:17:33,222
I mean, I'm not really dying,

1223
01:17:33,248 --> 01:17:36,286
but it kinds of puts shit
into perspective, doesn't it?

1224
01:17:36,318 --> 01:17:37,854
Plus you'd feel
like an asshole if I was.

1225
01:17:37,886 --> 01:17:41,424
Somebody should definitely
feel like an asshole right now.

1226
01:17:41,456 --> 01:17:43,800
Look, dude, what do you want?

1227
01:17:45,527 --> 01:17:47,529
If you could want anything
and it didn't matter,

1228
01:17:47,562 --> 01:17:48,836
what would you want?

1229
01:17:56,271 --> 01:17:58,217
To make the record
I wrote out here.

1230
01:17:59,775 --> 01:18:04,315
But how it sounds,
you know, not like--

1231
01:18:06,048 --> 01:18:07,891
and I don't care who puts it out,

1232
01:18:07,916 --> 01:18:10,192
who it's through,
I just want it to sound like

1233
01:18:10,218 --> 01:18:12,459
how it sounds here, like--
( stammers )

1234
01:18:14,089 --> 01:18:15,727
I want it to sound like me.

1235
01:18:15,757 --> 01:18:17,498
Good.
Let's record it.

1236
01:18:17,526 --> 01:18:18,800
Tell Abundant to take
it or leave it.

1237
01:18:18,827 --> 01:18:22,400
(laughs )Yeah.
My meeting's tomorrow.

1238
01:18:24,232 --> 01:18:26,234
Where would we even record it?

1239
01:18:29,204 --> 01:18:30,842
No.

1240
01:18:31,907 --> 01:18:33,045
No.

1241
01:18:34,076 --> 01:18:35,987
Will you be
my emergency contact?

1242
01:18:36,011 --> 01:18:37,922
Thank you.

1243
01:18:37,946 --> 01:18:38,981
You can step right in,

1244
01:18:39,014 --> 01:18:40,891
just leave the paperwork
on the desk.

1245
01:18:41,883 --> 01:18:42,918
Yeah.

1246
01:18:47,456 --> 01:18:50,335
Hey, doc, I got this.

1247
01:18:53,128 --> 01:18:55,074
What are you doing here?

1248
01:18:55,097 --> 01:18:58,476
We wanted to, um, well--

1249
01:18:58,500 --> 01:18:59,945
We need to use
the studio at the barn.

1250
01:18:59,968 --> 01:19:02,073
- That's why you're here?
- Yep.

1251
01:19:03,105 --> 01:19:05,949
Also if you don't mind,
cancerous?

1252
01:19:09,945 --> 01:19:12,050
You're fine, but you should
be seeing the dermatologist

1253
01:19:12,080 --> 01:19:13,252
at least once a year.

1254
01:19:20,455 --> 01:19:22,662
-( Whispers ) What was that?
- I don't have cancer.

1255
01:19:22,691 --> 01:19:25,900
No, I know,
but, for him to walk out.

1256
01:19:25,927 --> 01:19:29,067
I found the cold-hearted-snake
tone of voice a real doozy.

1257
01:19:29,097 --> 01:19:30,599
Should we leave?

1258
01:19:33,602 --> 01:19:35,206
You can go.

1259
01:19:36,271 --> 01:19:37,841
I set it up.

1260
01:19:58,860 --> 01:20:00,931
No.

1261
01:20:00,962 --> 01:20:03,636
No, he cannot just...

1262
01:20:06,635 --> 01:20:08,842
Hey!
Excuse me?

1263
01:20:11,640 --> 01:20:12,778
What are you doing?

1264
01:20:12,808 --> 01:20:16,483
No, Noah, no.
You do not get to snub me.

1265
01:20:16,511 --> 01:20:18,081
Do you understand that?

1266
01:20:18,113 --> 01:20:19,786
You are not allowed
to be cold to me,

1267
01:20:19,815 --> 01:20:22,694
when I should be cold to you.

1268
01:20:22,717 --> 01:20:26,358
You slept with me,
and it was--( Catherine sighs )

1269
01:20:26,388 --> 01:20:28,026
I mean, it was the be--
it was ama-

1270
01:20:29,057 --> 01:20:30,502
four times!

1271
01:20:31,593 --> 01:20:34,039
Okay, no, that's not the point.

1272
01:20:34,062 --> 01:20:36,599
The point is-- the point--
the point is this--

1273
01:20:36,631 --> 01:20:38,838
Catherine, what is your point?

1274
01:20:42,838 --> 01:20:44,715
I can't remember!

1275
01:20:44,739 --> 01:20:48,881
Okay, I saw you kiss Garret.

1276
01:20:48,910 --> 01:20:52,414
I drove to the city,
like an idiot, to see you.

1277
01:20:52,447 --> 01:20:54,825
I stood outside of that building
for an hour

1278
01:20:54,850 --> 01:20:57,888
and you walked
into someone else's arms.

1279
01:20:57,919 --> 01:20:59,899
Okay, and I was hurt.

1280
01:20:59,921 --> 01:21:01,594
Understandable.

1281
01:21:01,623 --> 01:21:04,604
You know what?
I know what you are.

1282
01:21:04,626 --> 01:21:07,800
You are a player.

1283
01:21:09,264 --> 01:21:10,743
What the fuck?!

1284
01:21:10,765 --> 01:21:12,870
- Whoa, whoa, whoa--
- I'm sorry, Mr. Harmon,

1285
01:21:12,901 --> 01:21:16,508
but this little liar man here
has this tall Namibian girlfriend

1286
01:21:16,538 --> 01:21:19,018
that he is hiding away
somewhere.

1287
01:21:19,040 --> 01:21:21,611
He's just storing her,
and you know what?

1288
01:21:21,643 --> 01:21:23,520
I came to see you, too.

1289
01:21:23,545 --> 01:21:27,789
After I left your house I drove
to your office to surprise you,

1290
01:21:27,816 --> 01:21:31,730
and I see you walk out
with legs-for-days over there.

1291
01:21:31,753 --> 01:21:35,758
So you didn't warn me about you,
but you should have.

1292
01:21:35,790 --> 01:21:37,770
Laura?

1293
01:21:38,760 --> 01:21:43,675
Laura is the new physician assistant
at my office.

1294
01:21:43,698 --> 01:21:46,872
Catherine, I have been single
since my mom died.

1295
01:21:52,741 --> 01:21:55,449
You know what?
Catherine, you should go.

1296
01:21:55,477 --> 01:21:56,581
You should go.

1297
01:21:58,480 --> 01:22:00,983
But I-I never slept with him,
no, I didn't.

1298
01:22:01,016 --> 01:22:04,020
He kissed me and then
I slept over at his house,

1299
01:22:04,052 --> 01:22:06,191
but that was later,
hours and hours later,

1300
01:22:06,221 --> 01:22:08,792
and we did sleep in the same bed,
but that was it.

1301
01:22:08,823 --> 01:22:10,825
I couldn't do it,

1302
01:22:10,859 --> 01:22:12,361
and I thought that you
were ditching me.

1303
01:22:12,394 --> 01:22:15,864
You are the one that I want
to have sex with, not Garret,

1304
01:22:15,897 --> 01:22:21,074
just you, Noah,
like, I want to have sex forever.

1305
01:22:21,102 --> 01:22:23,946
I want have forever
sex with you.

1306
01:22:31,479 --> 01:22:34,824
( Clears throat)

1307
01:22:37,452 --> 01:22:40,331
- Thanks for the studio.
- Mm.

1308
01:22:49,664 --> 01:22:51,234
Hey.

1309
01:22:55,603 --> 01:22:57,276
I'm so sorry.

1310
01:22:57,305 --> 01:22:59,148
I'm really sorry for what I said.

1311
01:23:04,045 --> 01:23:06,491
It wasn't your most
tactful moment.

1312
01:23:07,515 --> 01:23:11,019
But there was
some truth in all that.

1313
01:23:11,052 --> 01:23:12,656
There was.

1314
01:23:13,822 --> 01:23:16,564
Thank you for helping me,

1315
01:23:16,591 --> 01:23:20,198
for being so generous,
for showing me how to write

1316
01:23:20,228 --> 01:23:23,437
and showing me how--
just...

1317
01:23:24,966 --> 01:23:27,412
what I was looking
for when I came here.

1318
01:23:30,205 --> 01:23:32,378
I think you're doing
the right thing today.

1319
01:23:32,407 --> 01:23:35,513
- You do?
- 'Cause it sounds like you.

1320
01:23:35,543 --> 01:23:39,320
As long as you're being honest,
then it doesn't matter who puts it out.

1321
01:23:43,418 --> 01:23:45,659
I'm proud of you.

1322
01:23:45,687 --> 01:23:49,032
I think your dad would be, too.
Come on.

1323
01:24:17,018 --> 01:24:18,964
Can I come in?

1324
01:24:23,291 --> 01:24:25,737
I'm so sorry.

1325
01:24:25,760 --> 01:24:29,401
- That was our first fight.
- I know.

1326
01:24:29,431 --> 01:24:32,139
Unless you count the time
you slapped me after prom.

1327
01:24:32,167 --> 01:24:34,044
Blake Rutherford? No.

1328
01:24:34,069 --> 01:24:36,276
That was like
a "slap back to reality" slap,

1329
01:24:36,304 --> 01:24:38,614
so it doesn't count.

1330
01:24:40,742 --> 01:24:42,585
I don't hate your baby.

1331
01:24:42,610 --> 01:24:45,113
- You don't?
- No.

1332
01:24:45,146 --> 01:24:50,357
I love your baby.
It's gonna be the cutest.

1333
01:24:50,385 --> 01:24:53,423
Oh, look at us...

1334
01:24:53,455 --> 01:24:55,560
just a couple of grown-ups

1335
01:24:55,590 --> 01:24:58,196
having babies.

1336
01:24:58,226 --> 01:24:59,933
Come here.

1337
01:24:59,961 --> 01:25:02,840
- I miss you.
- I miss you, too.

1338
01:25:02,864 --> 01:25:05,140
And I'm hungry.
I'm always hungry.

1339
01:25:06,134 --> 01:25:08,444
Catherine's voice:
. And I don't know...

1340
01:25:08,470 --> 01:25:10,677
Let me think about it.
No.

1341
01:25:10,705 --> 01:25:12,184
No.

Man on radio:
All day love songs coming right up.

1350
01:25:46,040 --> 01:25:48,350
We want to hear
your stories, folks,

1351
01:25:48,376 --> 01:25:52,381
as we jam out these love songs
all day long.

1352
01:25:52,413 --> 01:25:54,290
But they can only be told
if you call in,

1353
01:25:54,315 --> 01:25:57,785
so give us a call--
SSS-ROCK.

1354
01:26:00,855 --> 01:26:03,927
Hey, there, our first caller.

1355
01:26:03,958 --> 01:26:06,165
What's your name?

1356
01:26:06,194 --> 01:26:07,969
- Hello?
- Hello, there.

1357
01:26:07,996 --> 01:26:11,842
Yeah, um...
uh, this is Catherine.

1358
01:26:11,866 --> 01:26:14,142
And you have a love story
for us, Catherine?

1359
01:26:14,169 --> 01:26:15,375
Yes, I do.

1360
01:26:15,403 --> 01:26:19,476
Um... but you know,

1361
01:26:19,507 --> 01:26:20,781
um, it's more than that.

1362
01:26:20,808 --> 01:26:24,153
It's, um--
it's-- it's kind of about...

1363
01:26:25,380 --> 01:26:30,227
um, music and Woodstock

1364
01:26:30,251 --> 01:26:33,698
and growth and then love.

1365
01:26:34,756 --> 01:26:38,829
Love is kind of the cherry
on top of my story.

1366
01:26:38,860 --> 01:26:40,271
Man: Okay.

1367
01:26:41,829 --> 01:26:46,744
Catherine: I-- I think that I may
have pushed away

1368
01:26:46,768 --> 01:26:49,044
the only guy that I've ever...

1369
01:26:51,105 --> 01:26:53,016
loved...

1370
01:26:53,041 --> 01:26:55,885
the only guy who's ever made
just complete and total sense

1371
01:26:55,910 --> 01:26:58,390
and, um...

1372
01:26:59,514 --> 01:27:02,927
and my dad used to say
that love--

1373
01:27:02,951 --> 01:27:07,331
forever love was just all resistance
and pain at the beginning,

1374
01:27:07,355 --> 01:27:10,859
and I think that
we got through that, so we're good,

1375
01:27:10,892 --> 01:27:16,103
and he might be listening
to you right now.

1376
01:27:16,130 --> 01:27:17,165
( Catherine exhales sharply)

1377
01:27:17,198 --> 01:27:20,042
And if he is,
I just want him to know

1378
01:27:20,068 --> 01:27:25,381
that he feels like family to me and--
( whimpers )

1379
01:27:25,406 --> 01:27:27,511
we both don't have any, so...

1380
01:27:31,813 --> 01:27:35,590
Uh, I'm on my way home,
and if he could just forgive me

1381
01:27:35,617 --> 01:27:40,623
or chalk it up to...
I don't know, rough beginnings,

1382
01:27:40,655 --> 01:27:44,967
I would just be the happiest,
most in-love lady

1383
01:27:44,993 --> 01:27:47,530
from, I don't know,
Kingston to Woodstock.

1384
01:27:48,630 --> 01:27:53,340
Just setting it all up
so it comes to me if it wants to...

1385
01:27:56,938 --> 01:27:58,576
if he wants to.

1386
01:27:59,874 --> 01:28:01,285
And that's my story.

1387
01:28:07,482 --> 01:28:08,825
( Horn honks )

1388
01:28:36,377 --> 01:28:38,516
(car approaching)

1389
01:29:09,610 --> 01:29:12,113
You acted crazy at my office.

1390
01:29:12,146 --> 01:29:14,387
Mr. Harmon got an earful.

1391
01:29:14,415 --> 01:29:17,089
I think he's still recovering.
I'm serious, Catherine.

1392
01:29:17,118 --> 01:29:19,325
After you left he complained
about heart palpitations

1393
01:29:19,354 --> 01:29:21,994
and told me about his first time.
Her name was Leslie.

1394
01:29:22,023 --> 01:29:25,402
She was blonde and plump
and had perfect lady parts.

1395
01:29:27,028 --> 01:29:28,530
I'm sorry.

1396
01:29:36,471 --> 01:29:37,575
So you're staying here, huh?

1397
01:29:39,741 --> 01:29:41,118
I remembered the point.

1398
01:29:41,142 --> 01:29:42,587
Oh, yeah?

1399
01:29:45,079 --> 01:29:46,615
Love is a battlefield.

1400
01:29:46,647 --> 01:29:48,786
- That's your point?
- Yeah.

1401
01:29:48,816 --> 01:29:51,296
That's your great,
big, epic point?

1402
01:29:54,856 --> 01:29:57,166
Look, can you just tell me
if you love me or not?

1403
01:29:57,191 --> 01:29:59,432
I know that's a lot to ask
of somebody.

1404
01:29:59,460 --> 01:30:02,031
I know that's a lot to ask
someone to be that clear,

1405
01:30:02,063 --> 01:30:05,772
but I just really need to know
the ending to this part of my story.

1406
01:30:05,800 --> 01:30:07,507
Are you kidding me?

1407
01:30:09,604 --> 01:30:12,016
I fucking love the shit out of you.

1408
01:30:42,003 --> 01:30:43,209
Forever sex time?

1409
01:30:43,237 --> 01:30:46,150
( laughs )
You're a serious perv.

1410
01:30:54,482 --> 01:30:56,689
(alarm clock buzzing )

1411
01:31:03,491 --> 01:31:07,029
Catherine: That's Noah Bernstein,
my husband.

1412
01:31:07,061 --> 01:31:12,170
He's a doctor.
He's really good.

1413
01:31:12,200 --> 01:31:16,205
And that's me, Catherine Brown,
the new me,

1414
01:31:16,237 --> 01:31:18,683
lives in Woodstock, New York.

1415
01:31:18,706 --> 01:31:21,550
The new me is signed
to a small Indie label

1416
01:31:21,576 --> 01:31:23,817
because she hates
the corporate music biz

1417
01:31:23,845 --> 01:31:25,882
and thinks that anyone
who takes it seriously

1418
01:31:25,913 --> 01:31:28,257
is a ridiculous person.

1419
01:31:28,282 --> 01:31:29,818
But this me...

1420
01:31:29,851 --> 01:31:33,025
This is so much more
than I could have hoped for.

1421
01:31:33,054 --> 01:31:35,398
The me that's finally living her life,

1422
01:31:35,423 --> 01:31:37,994
remembers what her dad
would always say,

1423
01:31:38,025 --> 01:31:39,402
"Never sell out.
Always put love first.

1424
01:31:41,562 --> 01:31:44,771
And if all else fails,
there's always Woodstock."
