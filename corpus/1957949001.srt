23
00:07:24,069 --> 00:07:25,069
[Walter] Hey there.

24
00:07:25,236 --> 00:07:26,236
Hey Walter.

25
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:28,031
[Walter] How ya hanging in
there?

26
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:30,367
Well just walking the grounds.

27
00:07:30,659 --> 00:07:31,326
Jesus Christ, Walter,

28
00:07:31,618 --> 00:07:33,787
how'd you keep this
place open for so long?

29
00:07:34,079 --> 00:07:37,916
I'm seeing like six or
seven code violations.

30
00:07:38,208 --> 00:07:39,528
The damn cabins are falling
apart.

31
00:07:39,668 --> 00:07:41,748
[Walter] Well friend,
that's why we have you there.

32
00:07:42,003 --> 00:07:43,963
I need that campsite up
and running within a week.

33
00:07:44,089 --> 00:07:45,715
And given your current snuafion,

34
00:07:46,007 --> 00:07:48,635
I didn't figure some hard
work and fresh air would hurt.

35
00:07:48,927 --> 00:07:50,321
That wasn't me complaining,
Walter.

36
00:07:50,345 --> 00:07:51,721
[Walter] I know, Gil, I know.

37
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:55,976
Walter, this nurse and
these kids, they know about...

38
00:07:56,267 --> 00:07:57,947
[Walter] They know
that you're a handyman

39
00:07:58,186 --> 00:07:59,466
and that's all they need to
know.

40
00:07:59,562 --> 00:08:00,562
Walter...

41
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:02,166
[Walter] They don't
need to know anything else

42
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:04,442
other than you and miss
hemsgrove are in charge.

43
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:09,688
So they're showing up today?

44
00:08:09,781 --> 00:08:11,550
[Walter] They should be there
within the next few hours,

45
00:08:11,574 --> 00:08:13,201
Gil, just do me a favor.

46
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:14,202
What?

47
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:16,222
[Walter] They're barely
old enough to drink,

48
00:08:16,246 --> 00:08:17,330
so be patient with 'em.

49
00:08:19,165 --> 00:08:20,709
- Great.
- You'll be fine.

50
00:08:21,001 --> 00:08:22,460
Listen, I'm gonna jump off here,

51
00:08:22,752 --> 00:08:24,272
I just wanted to check in and
make sure

52
00:08:24,337 --> 00:08:25,617
everything was going okay for
ya.

53
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:26,423
Thanks Walter.

54
00:08:26,715 --> 00:08:27,257
[Walter] Don't mention it.

55
00:08:27,549 --> 00:08:28,909
I'll call you tomorrow to check
in.

56
00:08:29,009 --> 00:08:29,551
Have a good one.

57
00:08:29,843 --> 00:08:30,843

00:08:39,102 --> 00:08:40,102

66
00:09:18,266 --> 00:09:19,768
Yeah, where you tryin' to find?

67
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:21,561
Uh, brook haven Metro park?

68
00:09:22,979 --> 00:09:27,108
Uh, (chuckles) It's
um, five miles that way.

69
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,860
(Women giggle)

70
00:09:29,152 --> 00:09:30,152
- Thank you.
- Oh.

71
00:09:31,488 --> 00:09:34,866
(Gentle, dramatic music)

72
00:09:41,831 --> 00:09:44,584

(Doors clatter)

76
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:14,739
My friends, we have arrived.

77
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:17,218
(Woman talking quietly)
(Door clatters)

78
00:10:17,242 --> 00:10:19,303
[Charlie] Perfect setting
for several days of food,

79
00:10:19,327 --> 00:10:20,453
booze and debauchery.

80
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:24,040
We can talk about the first
two, but,

81
00:10:24,332 --> 00:10:26,126
let's take it easy on the
latter.

82
00:10:26,417 --> 00:10:29,045
Well hello Mr. Tall drink of
water.

83
00:10:29,337 --> 00:10:30,337
Who is you?

84
00:10:31,256 --> 00:10:32,674
- I believe that would be Mr.
- Gil.

85
00:10:32,966 --> 00:10:35,510
He's in charge of the
construction program.

86
00:10:35,802 --> 00:10:38,096
[Tasha] Is that a first or a
last name?

87
00:10:38,388 --> 00:10:38,930
Why don't you guys get settled
in?

88
00:10:39,222 --> 00:10:40,390
I'm gonna go talk with him.

89
00:10:46,354 --> 00:10:47,564
Um, and just to be clear,

90
00:10:47,856 --> 00:10:49,176
there is plenty of room in my
bunk

91
00:10:49,232 --> 00:10:50,608
for you two fine-ass women.

92
00:10:53,486 --> 00:10:55,905
Her loss, I guess that just
leaves you, Hannah Montana.

93
00:10:56,197 --> 00:10:58,950
Yeah, I'd rather sleep on
salty, glass-covered pavement.

94
00:10:59,909 --> 00:11:02,745
(Gravel crackling)

95
00:11:06,624 --> 00:11:07,624
[Vanessa] Hello.

96
00:11:08,835 --> 00:11:09,835
[Gil] Hey.

97
00:11:10,044 --> 00:11:11,856
[Vanessa] Vanessa hemsgrove,
I'll be your acting...

98
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:13,923
Nurse, yeah, Walter told me.

99
00:11:14,215 --> 00:11:16,384
And you must be gillum Ross?

100
00:11:16,676 --> 00:11:17,676
Just Gil.

101
00:11:17,844 --> 00:11:19,155
Well Walter's had
nothing but great things

102
00:11:19,179 --> 00:11:20,388
to say about you, Gil.

103
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:21,680
[Gil] Likewise.

104
00:11:22,599 --> 00:11:24,893
Um, just thought I'd
come introduce myself

105
00:11:25,185 --> 00:11:27,854
since we're gonna be working
together the next few days.

106
00:11:30,273 --> 00:11:32,442
Well, I don't wanna disturb you.

107
00:11:33,318 --> 00:11:35,028
Uh, just be careful
out there, all right?

108
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:36,905
What do you mean?

109
00:11:37,197 --> 00:11:39,197
Oh, I haven't walked the
rest of the grounds yet,

110
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:42,076
so I've already found some
hazards, so there'll be others.

111
00:11:42,368 --> 00:11:45,371
Just be careful, and if you
find a hazard, come to me.

112
00:11:45,663 --> 00:11:46,663
Understood.

113
00:11:46,873 --> 00:11:47,582
And, it would be kind of bad

114
00:11:47,874 --> 00:11:49,518
if something happened to
our site nurse, right?

115
00:11:49,542 --> 00:11:51,211
No, we wouldn't want that now,
would we?

116
00:11:51,502 --> 00:11:54,047
Someone's liable to get
a bandaid on an ankle, so.

117
00:11:54,339 --> 00:11:55,339
Duly noted.

118
00:11:57,634 --> 00:12:00,094
(Door rattles)

119
00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:04,098
Welcome to the pine Hilton,
boys.

120
00:12:05,266 --> 00:12:06,434
[Charlie] (Chuckles) No.

121
00:12:09,145 --> 00:12:12,232
Did you get a side of
tetanus shot with this cabin?

122
00:12:12,523 --> 00:12:15,193
(Insects singing)

123
00:12:16,319 --> 00:12:18,821
(Door squeaks)

124
00:12:20,448 --> 00:12:23,534
(Switch clicks)

125
00:12:23,826 --> 00:12:26,246
(Door squeaks)

126
00:12:28,623 --> 00:12:31,209
(Bags rustling)

127
00:12:33,795 --> 00:12:35,463
(Zipper buzzes) (Door clatters)

128
00:12:35,755 --> 00:12:36,339
(Chuckles) Daddy's home.

129
00:12:36,631 --> 00:12:38,716
Ew, dude, get the fuck outta
here.

130
00:12:39,008 --> 00:12:40,288
What, you know you want me in.

131
00:12:40,426 --> 00:12:41,426
Bye Charlie.

132
00:12:43,972 --> 00:12:46,474
So, what are you ladies up to
today?

133
00:12:46,766 --> 00:12:48,309
Uh, we're probably gonna lay
out.

134
00:12:48,601 --> 00:12:49,601
[Courtney] Yep.

135
00:12:49,769 --> 00:12:51,569
I think I'm gonna go
see what Mason's up to.

136
00:12:51,688 --> 00:12:52,814
Obvious much?

137
00:12:53,106 --> 00:12:54,106
What?

138
00:12:54,732 --> 00:12:56,442
Mason is a hunter.

139
00:12:56,734 --> 00:12:57,934
(Laughs) Mason doesn't hunt.

140
00:12:58,069 --> 00:12:59,445
Jesus fucking Christ,

141
00:12:59,737 --> 00:13:02,240
guys like Mason like the
unobtainable.

142
00:13:02,532 --> 00:13:04,701
They like the thrill of the
chase.

143
00:13:05,618 --> 00:13:06,744
Okay.

144
00:13:07,036 --> 00:13:11,874
Okay, so he's a lion, and
you're a fucking elephant.

145
00:13:12,166 --> 00:13:13,166
I'm not fat.

146
00:13:13,209 --> 00:13:16,462
For fuck sake, Mason
takes one look at you

147
00:13:16,754 --> 00:13:18,047
and he knows he can have you

148
00:13:18,339 --> 00:13:20,967
because, like an elephant,
you're just there,

149
00:13:21,259 --> 00:13:22,969
and fucking obvious.

150
00:13:23,261 --> 00:13:28,099
Mason wants a gazelle that he
can chase down and tear apart.

151
00:13:31,686 --> 00:13:33,021
(Sighs) Well,

152
00:13:34,355 --> 00:13:36,524
(claps hands) I'm gonna
go get some work done.

153
00:13:36,816 --> 00:13:38,192
You girls have a good day.

154
00:13:39,944 --> 00:13:42,113

(Keys clink) (Rattle)

158
00:14:23,696 --> 00:14:25,416
[Driver] Well, this
could just have to do.

159
00:14:25,573 --> 00:14:27,116
Well, right to life, right?

160
00:14:27,408 --> 00:14:28,576
[Driver] Yeah.

161
00:14:31,079 --> 00:14:34,040
(Doors clatter)

162
00:14:34,332 --> 00:14:35,750
(Woman sighs)

163
00:14:36,042 --> 00:14:37,752
(Leaves crackling)

164
00:14:38,044 --> 00:14:39,796
Well I'm sure we'll
find some great spots

165
00:14:40,088 --> 00:14:41,464
to take some photo shots.

166
00:14:41,756 --> 00:14:43,216
Yes, I think so.

167
00:14:43,508 --> 00:14:48,346
(Leaves crackling)
(Quiet, ominous music)

168
00:14:57,313 --> 00:15:02,026
(Upbeat, rock music)
(Hammer thunking)

169
00:15:02,318 --> 00:15:04,078
- (Courtney chuckles)
- That was really rude.

170
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,531
That's not what I meant,
she took it the wrong way.

171
00:15:06,823 --> 00:15:11,661
(Hammer thunking)
(Upbeat, rock music)

172
00:15:35,143 --> 00:15:37,270
What are you looking at my
girls for?

173
00:15:37,562 --> 00:15:39,772
(Upbeat, rock music)

174
00:15:40,064 --> 00:15:42,066

(Insects singing)

177
00:16:05,465 --> 00:16:06,465
[Woman] Harper.

178
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:08,509
I'm gonna find you.

179
00:16:09,844 --> 00:16:14,765
(Insects singing)
(Quiet, dramatic music)

180
00:16:49,091 --> 00:16:52,970
Oh, I see what game
we're playing now, huh.

181
00:16:53,262 --> 00:16:58,100
(Ominous, rhythmic music)
(Insects singing)

182
00:17:09,946 --> 00:17:11,948
[Blond] You found me.

183
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:13,366
[Nicole] What do I win?

184
00:17:14,325 --> 00:17:16,244
You mightjust win me.

185
00:17:17,245 --> 00:17:20,414
(Giggles) I like that.

186
00:17:20,706 --> 00:17:22,041
Oh, I like that.

187
00:17:26,963 --> 00:17:31,050
Oh. (Giggles)

188
00:17:32,009 --> 00:17:34,762
(Blond sighs)

189
00:17:35,054 --> 00:17:37,223
(Blond giggles)

190
00:17:37,515 --> 00:17:40,726
(Rhythmic, upbeat music)

191
00:17:49,944 --> 00:17:52,405
(Nicole moans)

192
00:17:53,614 --> 00:17:55,950
[Miley] It says here
that 65% of all people

193
00:17:56,242 --> 00:17:57,482
have sex while they're camping.

194
00:17:57,743 --> 00:17:59,036
You get service out here?

195
00:17:59,328 --> 00:17:59,870
Yeah.

196
00:18:00,162 --> 00:18:02,206
Bullshit, there's no way.

197
00:18:02,498 --> 00:18:03,040
Why?

198
00:18:03,332 --> 00:18:04,452
Because it's a proven fact

199
00:18:04,667 --> 00:18:06,867
that once people get away
from the fuss of civilization,

200
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:09,422
they let their primal side come
out.

201
00:18:09,714 --> 00:18:10,914
This number's gotta be higher.

202
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:12,090
How much higher?

203
00:18:12,258 --> 00:18:13,884
95%, at least.

204
00:18:14,176 --> 00:18:15,177
Eh, I highly doubt it.

205
00:18:15,469 --> 00:18:16,669
Why, I mean, think about it,

206
00:18:16,804 --> 00:18:18,180
campfire, peace and quiet,

207
00:18:18,472 --> 00:18:22,476
nobody around for miles,
primal instincts kick in, baby.

208
00:18:22,768 --> 00:18:23,768
- (Men chuckle)
- Well,

209
00:18:23,811 --> 00:18:25,980
you obviously don't
understand how pussy works.

210
00:18:26,272 --> 00:18:31,110
(Rhythmic, upbeat music)
(Nicole moaning quietly)

211
00:18:43,414 --> 00:18:45,875
Yeah, not to mention it'd
be, like, super uncomfortable.

212
00:18:46,167 --> 00:18:48,961
I mean, scraped knees, elbows,

213
00:18:49,253 --> 00:18:50,671
branches and rocks under you,
eh.

214
00:18:50,963 --> 00:18:52,107
You need to shut that shit down.

215
00:18:52,131 --> 00:18:53,817
It just means you're not
doing it right, Courtney.

216
00:18:53,841 --> 00:18:55,551
Always be on top.

217
00:18:55,843 --> 00:18:56,385
- That's right.
- Good point.

218
00:18:56,677 --> 00:18:57,957
That's right, always be on top.

219
00:18:58,220 --> 00:19:01,057
And by the way, they make
stereotypes about this thing

220
00:19:01,349 --> 00:19:02,433
in horror movies and stuff,

221
00:19:02,725 --> 00:19:04,369
and there's gotta be a
reason for that, right?

222
00:19:04,393 --> 00:19:04,935
Yeah. (Courtney laughs)

223
00:19:05,227 --> 00:19:06,520
Yeah, and girls just love it

224
00:19:06,812 --> 00:19:08,972
when you stick it up their
ass, just like in porn, too.

225
00:19:09,023 --> 00:19:10,232
Really?

226
00:19:10,524 --> 00:19:11,067
Realiy.

227
00:19:11,359 --> 00:19:13,361
No, I was being fascist.

228
00:19:13,653 --> 00:19:14,820
Facetious.

229
00:19:15,112 --> 00:19:16,112
(Chuckles) Whatever.

230
00:19:16,364 --> 00:19:20,201
(Upbeat, rhythmic music)
(Accelerated breathing)

231
00:19:20,493 --> 00:19:21,869
(Nicole gasps)

232
00:19:22,161 --> 00:19:24,497
(Sighs) Hey Charlie,
grab me that bottle of spf.

233
00:19:25,915 --> 00:19:27,208
Today, preferably.

234
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:28,834
Whoa, hey tiger.

235
00:19:30,086 --> 00:19:31,921
(Men mutter)

236
00:19:32,213 --> 00:19:33,339
Don't miss my shoulders.

237
00:19:35,591 --> 00:19:37,031
I mean, don't get me wrong,
though,

238
00:19:37,218 --> 00:19:38,538
if I was walking through the
woods

239
00:19:38,594 --> 00:19:40,429
and that Gil guy showed up...

240
00:19:40,721 --> 00:19:41,721
That guy?

241
00:19:41,931 --> 00:19:43,557
He's like 40!

242
00:19:43,849 --> 00:19:46,268
Not to mention, he's as bald
as Tasha's stabbing cabin.

243
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:49,605
(Laughs) Okay, I really
like bald guys and he's older,

244
00:19:49,897 --> 00:19:51,667
which means he doesn't
have to be trained as much.

245
00:19:51,691 --> 00:19:53,567
Amen to that. (Grunts)

246
00:19:53,859 --> 00:19:55,979
Just right in there, bro',
just right, (pops tongue)

247
00:19:56,195 --> 00:19:57,530
Yeah bro', get in there.

248
00:19:58,781 --> 00:20:00,408
(Nicole gasping)
(Upbeat, rhythmic music)

249
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:01,951
You like that, baby?

250
00:20:02,243 --> 00:20:04,078
(Nicole gasping) Nicole, Nicole!

251
00:20:04,370 --> 00:20:08,541
(Foot thunks) (Nicole gasping)

252
00:20:08,833 --> 00:20:10,876
(Laughs) Charlie's got mahogany.

253
00:20:11,168 --> 00:20:12,545
- (Men laughing)
- What?

254
00:20:12,837 --> 00:20:15,297
(Laughs) Dude, it was like 10
seconds.

255
00:20:15,589 --> 00:20:18,467
It's human nature, it's primal.

256
00:20:18,759 --> 00:20:20,886
(Group laughing)

257
00:20:21,178 --> 00:20:22,298
[Tasha] You underwhelm me.

258
00:20:22,555 --> 00:20:26,559
Oh. (Laughs)

259
00:20:29,061 --> 00:20:31,689
What the fuck am I
supposed to do with this?

260
00:20:31,981 --> 00:20:34,275
[Tasha] Prove to us
you're not a two-pump chump.

261
00:20:34,567 --> 00:20:35,901
[Charlie] Come the fuck on.

262
00:20:38,446 --> 00:20:40,281
How about you and I
take a walk over there?

263
00:20:40,573 --> 00:20:41,699
Mm, walk huh?

264
00:20:41,991 --> 00:20:43,868
- Mmhmm.
- Mmm, is that all?

265
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:47,455
Oh no, I'm pretty sure we
can figure other things to do.

266
00:20:47,747 --> 00:20:50,082
- Mm, oh yeah?
- Oh yeah.

267
00:20:50,374 --> 00:20:53,043
(Insects singing)

268
00:21:03,387 --> 00:21:04,531
What's happening, hot stuff?

269
00:21:04,555 --> 00:21:06,515
I thought you guys went
to lay out or something?

270
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:08,058
We were, but Charlie got
religion

271
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:10,060
while putting sunscreen on me.

272
00:21:10,352 --> 00:21:10,936
What?

273
00:21:11,228 --> 00:21:12,228
I can't reach my back.

274
00:21:12,396 --> 00:21:13,396
Uh huh.

275
00:21:14,982 --> 00:21:16,400
It's not what you think.

276
00:21:16,692 --> 00:21:18,027
Oh sure.

277
00:21:18,319 --> 00:21:19,838
You know what, I don't
think you're as immune

278
00:21:19,862 --> 00:21:22,490
to the rigors of careless
sex after all, nurse Betty.

279
00:21:23,616 --> 00:21:25,409
Contrary to popular belief,

280
00:21:25,701 --> 00:21:28,954
there are more important things
to talk about than just sex.

281
00:21:29,246 --> 00:21:30,246
Really, like what?

282
00:21:31,499 --> 00:21:33,834
Like fixing this cabin.

283
00:21:34,126 --> 00:21:37,171
And Mr. Gil is doing a great
job adhering to all the rules

284
00:21:37,463 --> 00:21:39,673
and I think we should follow his
example.

285
00:21:39,965 --> 00:21:44,804
(Engine humming)
(Hammer thumping)

286
00:21:49,683 --> 00:21:54,605
(Birds chirping)
(Insects singing)

287
00:21:55,689 --> 00:21:56,689
(Door clatters)

288
00:21:56,816 --> 00:21:57,816
Well,

289
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:02,738
looks pretty nice.

290
00:22:04,907 --> 00:22:05,907
I like it out here.

291
00:22:07,451 --> 00:22:08,451
This is nice,

292
00:22:09,745 --> 00:22:10,745
real nice.

293
00:22:12,498 --> 00:22:14,208
Help you with something?

294
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:18,295
[Officer] Got a nice
setup out here, huh?

295
00:22:18,587 --> 00:22:19,213
It's all right.

296
00:22:19,505 --> 00:22:20,881
(Chuckles) All right?

297
00:22:21,173 --> 00:22:22,550
Yeah, I'll say it's all right.

298
00:22:22,842 --> 00:22:27,596
Jesus, wide, open space,
freedom to go about your day,

299
00:22:28,639 --> 00:22:31,183
I bet you get a nice workout
out here too, don't ya?

300
00:22:32,268 --> 00:22:32,935
[Gil] Sure.

301
00:22:33,227 --> 00:22:34,227
Sure.

302
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:36,063
Yeah, it's really nice.

303
00:22:36,355 --> 00:22:38,983
Oh, and the poon walking around
here,

304
00:22:39,275 --> 00:22:40,860
holy Mary mother of fuck.

305
00:22:41,944 --> 00:22:44,071
Bet you're just in heaven
out here, aren't you?

306
00:22:46,282 --> 00:22:48,576
Come on, Gil, you can't tell me

307
00:22:48,868 --> 00:22:50,744
the thought hasn't crossed your
mind.

308
00:22:51,036 --> 00:22:53,581
After five years, I would've
thought you would have

309
00:22:53,873 --> 00:22:57,084
worn one of these fur burgers
as a flesh condom by now.

310
00:22:57,376 --> 00:22:58,376
Are you kidding?

311
00:22:58,419 --> 00:23:00,880
Look at him, he would
wanna bitch any one of us

312
00:23:01,171 --> 00:23:02,256
if given the opportunity.

313
00:23:02,548 --> 00:23:03,090
You can see it in his eyes.

314
00:23:03,382 --> 00:23:05,426
I seriously doubt that.

315
00:23:05,718 --> 00:23:07,469
Well, we'll see about that.

316
00:23:07,761 --> 00:23:10,931
(Chuckles) Gil is way too old
for you.

317
00:23:11,223 --> 00:23:12,766
So was my therapist.

318
00:23:13,058 --> 00:23:13,601
God.

319
00:23:13,893 --> 00:23:15,686
Uh, five oh is here.

320
00:23:15,978 --> 00:23:17,271
Did somebody order bacon?

321
00:23:17,563 --> 00:23:19,857
[Vanessa] I have no idea.

322
00:23:24,445 --> 00:23:26,238
Ah, there he is.

323
00:23:27,990 --> 00:23:30,367
What's wrong, push your button?

324
00:23:31,452 --> 00:23:32,119
No sir.

325
00:23:32,411 --> 00:23:33,412
No sir?

326
00:23:33,704 --> 00:23:34,704
That's really good.

327
00:23:35,998 --> 00:23:37,475
See, it'd a been a shame if you
timed out

328
00:23:37,499 --> 00:23:40,419
to go right back in, assaulting
an officer of the law.

329
00:23:41,503 --> 00:23:42,503
Know what I mean?

330
00:23:42,713 --> 00:23:44,149
Is there something I can
help you with, officer?

331
00:23:44,173 --> 00:23:45,173
And you are?

332
00:23:45,424 --> 00:23:47,760
[Vanessa] Vanessa hemsgrove,
the nurse here at the camp.

333
00:23:48,052 --> 00:23:49,470
Mrs. Hemsgrove.

334
00:23:49,762 --> 00:23:50,304
Miss.

335
00:23:50,596 --> 00:23:52,723
Ah miss, well, no need to be
alarmed,

336
00:23:53,015 --> 00:23:54,767
just taking up my friend, Gil
here,

337
00:23:55,059 --> 00:23:57,770
standard procedure to
keep tabs on ex-cons.

338
00:23:58,062 --> 00:23:59,647
Wait, so this guy's an ex-con?

339
00:24:00,731 --> 00:24:03,567
They can't be around
girls and such, right?

340
00:24:03,859 --> 00:24:06,111
Depends on what they were
locked up for.

341
00:24:06,403 --> 00:24:07,863
Mr. Gil's doing a find job.

342
00:24:08,155 --> 00:24:10,407
(Laughs) Mr. Gil.

343
00:24:11,909 --> 00:24:13,160
That's cute.

344
00:24:13,452 --> 00:24:15,120
You're interrupting Mr. Gil's
job,

345
00:24:15,412 --> 00:24:16,452
so if there was something,

346
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:17,940
someone you'd like to speak
with...

347
00:24:18,207 --> 00:24:20,793
No no no, that's not necessary.

348
00:24:31,553 --> 00:24:34,139
(Door clatters)

349
00:24:35,891 --> 00:24:37,685
You behave yourself, Gil,

350
00:24:37,977 --> 00:24:39,120
I don't wanna get any phone
calls

351
00:24:39,144 --> 00:24:40,163
from any of these fine ladies,

352
00:24:40,187 --> 00:24:42,106
saying that you've misbehaved.

353
00:24:42,398 --> 00:24:43,398
We clear?

354
00:24:44,149 --> 00:24:45,149
Crystal.

355
00:24:46,068 --> 00:24:47,068
Well that's good.

356
00:24:48,529 --> 00:24:51,198
All righty, you folks have a
great day.

357
00:24:52,574 --> 00:24:54,535
We'll see you soon, Mr. Gil.

358
00:24:58,247 --> 00:25:00,040
[Vanessa] Don't you got
something to do?

359
00:25:01,166 --> 00:25:03,752
Tsk tsk tsk, naughty boy.

360
00:25:04,044 --> 00:25:05,796
[Vanessa] Go.

361
00:25:06,088 --> 00:25:08,549
(Mutters) We got stuff to, do.

362
00:25:17,808 --> 00:25:21,311
(Knife patters) (Liquid burbles)

363
00:25:21,603 --> 00:25:26,442
(Quiet, ominous music)
(Insects singing)

364
00:25:28,318 --> 00:25:31,697
(Lighter clicking)

365
00:25:31,989 --> 00:25:34,700
(Flames crackling)

366
00:25:38,787 --> 00:25:39,787
- Hey.
- Hey.

367
00:25:39,872 --> 00:25:40,414
(Chair rattles)

368
00:25:40,706 --> 00:25:42,082
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

369
00:25:42,374 --> 00:25:43,584
There she is.

370
00:25:43,876 --> 00:25:46,879
[Vanessa] Yeah yeah,
so what's the skinny?

371
00:25:47,171 --> 00:25:49,798
The skinny, people
still say shit like that?

372
00:25:50,090 --> 00:25:51,484
Yes, just 'cause I'm a little
older

373
00:25:51,508 --> 00:25:54,053
doesn't mean I don't
still know the hip lingo.

374
00:25:54,344 --> 00:25:56,144
- (Group giggles)
- Yeah, the hip lingo, okay.

375
00:25:57,639 --> 00:25:58,639
No uh,

376
00:25:58,891 --> 00:26:02,436
we were actually just
discussing our ex-con handyman.

377
00:26:02,728 --> 00:26:03,937
Listen, I get you guys

378
00:26:04,229 --> 00:26:07,107
may be a little confused
or on edge, but trust me,

379
00:26:07,399 --> 00:26:10,027
you literally have nothing to
worry about.

380
00:26:10,319 --> 00:26:12,529
Why, just 'cause the
boss-man said it's cool?

381
00:26:13,822 --> 00:26:15,949
Yeah, that makes me feel so much
better.

382
00:26:16,241 --> 00:26:17,868
Things like this is normal.

383
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:19,554
Sometimes when people's
been in the system,

384
00:26:19,578 --> 00:26:21,830
they need a little
assistance on a job and Mr.,

385
00:26:22,790 --> 00:26:24,230
I mean, he's been staying to
himself.

386
00:26:24,416 --> 00:26:25,876
Just leave him alone.

387
00:26:26,168 --> 00:26:26,877
All I know is people like that

388
00:26:27,169 --> 00:26:28,962
have a lot of pent up aggression
and shit.

389
00:26:29,254 --> 00:26:31,590
Oh yeah, and how many
ex-con men do you know?

390
00:26:33,634 --> 00:26:34,885
That's what I thought.

391
00:26:35,177 --> 00:26:37,012
And you too, weren't you just
saying

392
00:26:37,304 --> 00:26:39,181
you were into his sexy, working
man vibe,

393
00:26:39,473 --> 00:26:41,141
literally a few hours ago?

394
00:26:41,433 --> 00:26:42,893
(Clears throat) Yeah, you were.

395
00:26:43,185 --> 00:26:45,437
That was before they knew
he got locked up, though.

396
00:26:45,729 --> 00:26:47,272
I think it just makes it sexier.

397
00:26:49,608 --> 00:26:53,529
Always a sucker for
the bad boys, huh Tasha?

398
00:26:53,821 --> 00:26:57,157
Lay off Gil already,
he's keeping to himself,

399
00:26:57,449 --> 00:26:59,529
we don't need you all making
it a little bit awkward.

400
00:26:59,660 --> 00:27:01,537
I still wanna know what
he was locked up for.

401
00:27:01,829 --> 00:27:02,955
My bet's drugs.

402
00:27:03,247 --> 00:27:04,447
I think he got caught running.

403
00:27:04,581 --> 00:27:06,792
Nah, he looks like a
breaking and entering guy.

404
00:27:07,084 --> 00:27:07,751
(Gil whistles) (Dramatic music)

405
00:27:08,043 --> 00:27:10,796
Jesus Christ, creep much?

406
00:27:11,088 --> 00:27:11,630
Miley.

407
00:27:11,922 --> 00:27:12,922
What?

408
00:27:14,508 --> 00:27:16,301
I just came to check out the
fire.

409
00:27:17,678 --> 00:27:20,931
(Quiet, dramatic music)

410
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:26,788
So come on, Gil, what'd
you get locked up for?

411
00:27:26,812 --> 00:27:29,231
[Vanessa] That's none of your
business.

412
00:27:29,523 --> 00:27:31,650
Well, about five years ago,

413
00:27:31,942 --> 00:27:33,735
friend of mine, came, asked for
help,

414
00:27:34,820 --> 00:27:37,614
he got in with some bad
people, owed a lot of money.

415
00:27:39,908 --> 00:27:40,908
What's a lot?

416
00:27:43,412 --> 00:27:44,412
About 500.

417
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:47,541
(Chuckles) $500, that's not a
lot.

418
00:27:48,917 --> 00:27:50,294
$500,000.

419
00:27:50,586 --> 00:27:51,587
- Fuck.
- Damn.

420
00:27:54,131 --> 00:27:55,883
So what happened?

421
00:27:56,175 --> 00:28:00,053
Well, he came to me, had
a plan about scrapping cars

422
00:28:00,345 --> 00:28:02,389
to make money to pay the debt
off.

423
00:28:02,681 --> 00:28:04,600
Doesn't sound like you'd
make that much money.

424
00:28:04,892 --> 00:28:07,436
I mean, not $500,000.

425
00:28:07,728 --> 00:28:10,898
Well it wouldn't, but if
you can make cars disappear,

426
00:28:11,190 --> 00:28:12,190
it would.

427
00:28:12,441 --> 00:28:15,360
Cars that belong to very bad
people.

428
00:28:16,904 --> 00:28:19,323
And so that's what we did,
we made cars disappear.

429
00:28:20,449 --> 00:28:23,410
Wait a second, you're
telling me you ran a chop shop?

430
00:28:23,702 --> 00:28:24,702
We did.

431
00:28:25,621 --> 00:28:28,373
And the money flowed in like a
flood.

432
00:28:28,665 --> 00:28:30,042
He was able to pay off his debt.

433
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:32,919
Shoulda stopped though.

434
00:28:33,170 --> 00:28:34,170
We didn't.

435
00:28:34,963 --> 00:28:36,256
We got greedy.

436
00:28:36,548 --> 00:28:37,716
So how'd you get caught?

437
00:28:39,009 --> 00:28:41,929
Eh, it seems we weren't as
close as I thought we were.

438
00:28:42,221 --> 00:28:44,389
Cops got wind of the
operation, brought him in,

439
00:28:45,641 --> 00:28:46,761
basically offered him a deal

440
00:28:46,975 --> 00:28:48,455
which would pin the whole thing
on me.

441
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:49,560
So he sold you out.

442
00:28:50,896 --> 00:28:53,440
Damn dude, that is cold blooded.

443
00:28:53,732 --> 00:28:56,276
Yeah, he uh, basically got
probation

444
00:28:56,568 --> 00:28:59,613
and I got 10 years,
sentenced to state prison,

445
00:28:59,905 --> 00:29:02,074
Lebanon state prison,

446
00:29:03,825 --> 00:29:05,661
served five, got out on good
behavior.

447
00:29:06,995 --> 00:29:08,580
- (Chuckles non-humorously)
- Fuck.

448
00:29:13,418 --> 00:29:14,418
To Gil.

449
00:29:14,670 --> 00:29:16,713
The unluckiest car-killer alive.

450
00:29:17,005 --> 00:29:19,758
(Glasses clinking)

451
00:29:22,844 --> 00:29:24,072
Hey, where are you two headed
off to,

452
00:29:24,096 --> 00:29:25,389
the party's just getting
started.

453
00:29:25,681 --> 00:29:27,161
Eh, we're gonna take a little
stroll

454
00:29:27,432 --> 00:29:29,559
and make a little party of our
own.

455
00:29:29,851 --> 00:29:32,271
Now guys, stay close, take a
flashlight.

456
00:29:32,562 --> 00:29:36,733
But if we're too close,
you'll hear us. (Giggles)

457
00:29:37,025 --> 00:29:39,403
Try to keep some
reservations about yourselves.

458
00:29:39,695 --> 00:29:43,156
Yeah, and uh, watch out
for snakes and poison Ivy,

459
00:29:43,448 --> 00:29:45,117
and um, herpes.

460
00:29:45,409 --> 00:29:47,095
- (Groups laughs)
- Fuck you, douche schnakal.

461
00:29:47,119 --> 00:29:49,359
Hey, if that's an offer, I
am down for a love sandwich.

462
00:29:49,454 --> 00:29:50,872
Courtney, you can be the roast
beef

463
00:29:51,164 --> 00:29:52,249
oh. (Laughs)

464
00:29:52,541 --> 00:29:54,418
(Group laughing)

465
00:29:54,710 --> 00:29:55,710
Fuck off.

466
00:29:57,004 --> 00:29:58,005
Roast beef? (Laughs)

467
00:29:58,297 --> 00:29:59,881
I know you love roast beef,
dude.

468
00:30:04,177 --> 00:30:07,389
- Listen, roast beef, (laughs)
- Wait here,

469
00:30:07,681 --> 00:30:10,976
count to 10, and then follow
the trail and come find me.

470
00:30:11,268 --> 00:30:12,268
Why?

471
00:30:12,352 --> 00:30:13,454
'Cause I have a surprise for
you.

472
00:30:13,478 --> 00:30:14,478
What kind of surprise?

473
00:30:14,688 --> 00:30:17,649
It's gonna be a big surprise,
it's gonna blow your mind.

474
00:30:19,026 --> 00:30:20,819
Okay. (Laughs)

475
00:30:23,780 --> 00:30:25,157
So you're in to bad boys?

476
00:30:29,328 --> 00:30:30,370
I could be a bad boy.

477
00:30:31,580 --> 00:30:36,501
(Insects singing)
(Fire crackling)

478
00:30:44,926 --> 00:30:46,386
Where you headed off to?

479
00:30:46,678 --> 00:30:49,389
Anywhere you're not. (Hands
slap legs)

480
00:30:49,681 --> 00:30:54,519
(Fire crackling)
(Insects singing)

481
00:31:03,779 --> 00:31:04,863
Tah dah!

482
00:31:05,155 --> 00:31:05,697
[Courtney] (Giggles) What?

483
00:31:05,989 --> 00:31:06,989
Yeah?

484
00:31:07,115 --> 00:31:08,843
You wanna get in the tent
or you wanna mull it over?

485
00:31:08,867 --> 00:31:10,619
[Courtney] Oh my god. (Laughs)

486
00:31:10,911 --> 00:31:12,788
Get in. (Zipper buzzing)

487
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:14,915
(Mutters) (Grunts) Yeah see,
look.

488
00:31:16,166 --> 00:31:17,406
- I brought a bag of toys.
- Oh.

489
00:31:17,542 --> 00:31:19,086
And bug-free.

490
00:31:20,003 --> 00:31:23,548
All right, so I admit, I like
the tent,

491
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:26,259
- but explain this.
- What?

492
00:31:26,551 --> 00:31:27,094
- Oh this.
- Yeah.

493
00:31:27,386 --> 00:31:29,638
Oh, you know how cosplay is my
kink.

494
00:31:29,930 --> 00:31:30,514
- Uh huh.
- Yeah,

495
00:31:30,806 --> 00:31:31,991
you remember the thing with the
fairies?

496
00:31:32,015 --> 00:31:33,015
- Mmhmm.
- Shh,

497
00:31:33,141 --> 00:31:33,850
let's not talk about that,
it was a dark time for us.

498
00:31:34,142 --> 00:31:36,686
But this, like look,
we're out in the woods,

499
00:31:36,978 --> 00:31:38,706
it's like an 80's movie
with the hockey masks

500
00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:40,250
and the stabbings and things
like that,

501
00:31:40,315 --> 00:31:42,275
and I'm like the unruly
camper and you're like

502
00:31:42,567 --> 00:31:46,029
the hot, sexy, camp counselor
that I'm just tryin' to fuck.

503
00:31:46,321 --> 00:31:47,321
Yeah.

504
00:31:47,406 --> 00:31:48,716
(Chuckles) Don't they
usually die in those movies?

505
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:50,385
Yeah, but we're just
gonna do the sex part.

506
00:31:50,409 --> 00:31:51,511
(Laughs) That's when they die.

507
00:31:51,535 --> 00:31:52,887
Yeah, but we're just
gonna do the sex part.

508
00:31:52,911 --> 00:31:53,495
[Courtney] Oh my god.

509
00:31:53,787 --> 00:31:56,581
Oh, or, I could be a bounty
hunter.

510
00:31:58,458 --> 00:32:00,043
[Courtney] Okay, now we're
talkin'.

511
00:32:00,335 --> 00:32:01,335
You're under arrest.

512
00:32:03,296 --> 00:32:05,215
You have the right to remain
naked,

513
00:32:05,507 --> 00:32:07,107
you take that off and I'll take
this off,

514
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:08,460
'cause I have that right too.

515
00:32:08,552 --> 00:32:09,752
It's equal rights around here.

516
00:32:09,803 --> 00:32:12,514
You have the right, give
me this, goddamn it.

517
00:32:12,806 --> 00:32:14,474
Just take that off, fuckin',

518
00:32:15,434 --> 00:32:16,554
(clothing clatters) (Laughs)

519
00:32:16,685 --> 00:32:19,271
Anything you say can and
will be held against my body.

520
00:32:20,397 --> 00:32:22,315
Your dick smuggling days are
oven

521
00:32:22,607 --> 00:32:25,610
you will take these off
and you are going downtown,

522
00:32:25,902 --> 00:32:27,404
gimme, gimme 'em.

523
00:32:51,636 --> 00:32:54,014
You know, if you ask
me, that's just rude.

524
00:32:54,306 --> 00:32:56,033
I mean, we're all here,
having a good time, right,

525
00:32:56,057 --> 00:32:59,436
having fun, and they
just get up and walk off.

526
00:32:59,728 --> 00:33:00,728
Come on!

527
00:33:06,485 --> 00:33:10,155
(Door rattles) (Mason whistles)

528
00:33:10,447 --> 00:33:12,449
I didn't think you got the hint.

529
00:33:12,741 --> 00:33:13,825
Oh, I got it.

530
00:33:15,243 --> 00:33:16,536
You got it, huh?

531
00:33:16,828 --> 00:33:18,038
Yeah.

532
00:33:18,330 --> 00:33:23,168
- Wanna see it?
- (Rhythmic, sassy music)

533
00:33:36,348 --> 00:33:37,807
[Mason] Oh fuck.

534
00:33:38,099 --> 00:33:41,269
(Rhythmic, sassy music)

535
00:33:42,521 --> 00:33:45,899
Well uh, I guess it's just
you and me, kitten whiskers.

536
00:33:46,191 --> 00:33:48,193
(Miley chuckles quietly)

537
00:33:48,485 --> 00:33:49,653
No Charlie.

538
00:33:51,446 --> 00:33:52,446
It's just you, boo.

539
00:33:54,908 --> 00:33:55,908
I'm crashing.

540
00:33:59,287 --> 00:34:01,873
(Fire crackling)

541
00:34:02,165 --> 00:34:03,165
I think I'm in love.

542
00:34:03,959 --> 00:34:05,186
[Will] Playing hard to get,
that's fine.

543
00:34:05,210 --> 00:34:05,877
[Courtney] Yeah.

544
00:34:06,169 --> 00:34:07,379
Get over here, criminals.

545
00:34:08,505 --> 00:34:11,466
All right, so, woop, you
like these underwear,

546
00:34:11,758 --> 00:34:13,385
you criminal, that's right, you
do.

547
00:34:14,344 --> 00:34:15,595
Get out of here.

548
00:34:16,638 --> 00:34:18,932
Here.

549
00:34:19,224 --> 00:34:19,891
- Here we are.
- Oh.

550
00:34:20,183 --> 00:34:21,183
There we go.

551
00:34:22,602 --> 00:34:27,065
(Courtney breathing heavy)
(Quiet, dramatic music)

552
00:34:27,357 --> 00:34:28,357
There you go.

553
00:34:28,942 --> 00:34:29,942
Gotta like that,

554
00:34:29,985 --> 00:34:32,279
you're the best camp
counselor I've ever had.

555
00:34:32,571 --> 00:34:34,698
Too bad I had to arrest you.

556
00:34:34,990 --> 00:34:37,784
(Grunting) Ye haw, come on!

557
00:34:38,076 --> 00:34:40,036
Oh now, mm mm, we did cowboys
last time.

558
00:34:40,328 --> 00:34:41,788
Okay, sorry sorry sorry.

559
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:45,041
(Upbeat, rock music)

560
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:56,761
(Tasha groaning)
(Upbeat, rock music)

561
00:35:45,685 --> 00:35:47,228
(Door clatters)

562
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:50,440
(Upbeat, rock music)

563
00:35:56,738 --> 00:36:00,450
So uh, I'm like super
tired, I mean it's like,

564
00:36:00,742 --> 00:36:01,826
what time, like 2:00?

565
00:36:03,453 --> 00:36:04,453
10:30.

566
00:36:05,413 --> 00:36:06,581
(Exhales) Really?

567
00:36:07,749 --> 00:36:08,749
Shit.

568
00:36:10,085 --> 00:36:13,004
Tell you what, man, in the
shed, underneath the mattress.

569
00:36:15,131 --> 00:36:16,131
Okay.

570
00:36:21,846 --> 00:36:24,891
So, what are you doing here?

571
00:36:25,183 --> 00:36:26,559
You know my story, what's yours?

572
00:36:28,019 --> 00:36:29,521
Not much of a story to tell.

573
00:36:30,605 --> 00:36:32,524
Oh, I don't believe that for a
second.

574
00:36:32,816 --> 00:36:33,900
What makes you say that?

575
00:36:35,276 --> 00:36:38,405
Well because Walter told
me a little bit about you.

576
00:36:38,697 --> 00:36:43,535
Graduated St. Johns in a dsnc
with para-anesthesiology.

577
00:36:45,787 --> 00:36:46,787
Impressive.

578
00:36:47,831 --> 00:36:49,016
Just because I'm a simple guy

579
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:51,918
doesn't mean I'm a stupid
one, miss hemsgrove.

580
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:55,130
Ah, I knew you'd like this
mullet ride.

581
00:36:55,422 --> 00:36:58,049
- (Courtney mutters)
- Ah, I know,

582
00:36:58,341 --> 00:37:00,927
that's what mullets do,
they're magical. (Grunts)

583
00:37:01,219 --> 00:37:03,555
(Courtney giggles)
(Will grunting)

584
00:37:03,847 --> 00:37:05,223
All right, okay.

585
00:37:05,515 --> 00:37:08,351
All right, you criminal,
'bout ready to take you in.

586
00:37:08,643 --> 00:37:09,769
- Yeah?
- Oh yeah.

587
00:37:10,061 --> 00:37:12,188
Okay. (Grunts)

588
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:15,400
Okay, oh okay. (Grunts)

589
00:37:16,443 --> 00:37:19,237
(Laughs) Oh, that's mullet
magic, baby.

590
00:37:20,655 --> 00:37:23,241
Oh. (Exhaling)

591
00:37:25,994 --> 00:37:26,994
[Courtney] Shit.

592
00:37:27,203 --> 00:37:28,955
Did you like that?

593
00:37:29,247 --> 00:37:31,458
[Courtney] Yeah. (Mutters)

594
00:37:31,750 --> 00:37:33,293
You gotta pee?

595
00:37:33,585 --> 00:37:34,585
Well don't do it here.

596
00:37:34,753 --> 00:37:37,464
(Courtney laughs) (Mutters)

597
00:37:37,756 --> 00:37:40,008
Do you think I could
grow a mullet on my pubes?

598
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:44,929
(Zipper buzzes)
(Quiet, dramatic music)

599
00:37:45,221 --> 00:37:50,059
(Creature squishing)
(Quiet, dramatic music)

600
00:38:01,905 --> 00:38:03,990
(Magazines clap)
(Charlie exhales)

601
00:38:04,282 --> 00:38:06,534
God fuckin' bless you, Gil.

602
00:38:08,286 --> 00:38:09,579
(Laughs) Girl.

603
00:38:14,667 --> 00:38:16,377
(Door clatters)

604
00:38:16,669 --> 00:38:21,508
(Upbeat, rock music)
(Tasha groaning)

605
00:38:34,729 --> 00:38:38,441
(Quiet, dramatic music)

606
00:38:38,733 --> 00:38:43,571
(Creature squishes)
(Quiet, dramatic music)

607
00:38:51,412 --> 00:38:53,373
So, why after all of that,

608
00:38:53,665 --> 00:38:57,001
would you be wasting your
skills as a nurse here?

609
00:38:57,961 --> 00:39:01,089
Seems like, to me, you're
running from something.

610
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:04,800
Or someone.

611
00:39:06,261 --> 00:39:09,222
(Upbeat, rock music)

612
00:39:10,473 --> 00:39:12,058
(Stool screeches)

613
00:39:12,350 --> 00:39:17,188
(Upbeat, rock music)
(Tasha grunting)

614
00:39:17,522 --> 00:39:18,522
Let's just say,

615
00:39:18,565 --> 00:39:20,942
when you're in a
relationship with your boss,

616
00:39:22,610 --> 00:39:26,406
it casts a dark shadow over
someone with a career like mine

617
00:39:26,698 --> 00:39:31,536
and when said boss fails to
let you know that he's married,

618
00:39:34,247 --> 00:39:35,247
yeah.

619
00:39:36,332 --> 00:39:38,293
Then you just move locations,

620
00:39:38,585 --> 00:39:40,105
you don't take the cheapest
paying lob,

621
00:39:40,253 --> 00:39:41,880
watching a bunch of kids.

622
00:39:42,171 --> 00:39:44,591
(Dramatic, suspenseful music)

623
00:39:44,883 --> 00:39:48,761
- What the fuck is that?
- (Shrieking)

624
00:39:49,053 --> 00:39:51,598
Yeah, they seem a little
rough around the edges at times,

625
00:39:51,890 --> 00:39:54,058
but they're really good kids.

626
00:39:56,102 --> 00:39:59,772
Well, to us, society's misfits.

627
00:40:00,064 --> 00:40:04,903
(Bottles clink)
(Vanessa chuckles)

628
00:40:05,194 --> 00:40:08,197
(Gentle, quiet music)

629
00:40:10,825 --> 00:40:15,747
(Birds chirping)
(Gentle, quiet music)

630
00:41:22,772 --> 00:41:25,775
(Clomping footsteps)

631
00:41:28,111 --> 00:41:28,778
(Door clatters)

632
00:41:29,070 --> 00:41:31,072
[Mason] Good morning, sweet
cheeks.

633
00:41:31,364 --> 00:41:32,532
Now you're just teasing me.

634
00:41:37,745 --> 00:41:38,955
Rough night?

635
00:41:39,247 --> 00:41:40,999
Oh, I was just being a lion
tamer.

636
00:41:45,294 --> 00:41:47,922
(Chair clatters)

637
00:41:48,214 --> 00:41:49,716
What's up her ass?

638
00:41:53,469 --> 00:41:55,221
Miss hemsgrove.

639
00:41:55,513 --> 00:41:56,513
[Vanessa] Mr. Gil.

640
00:41:58,850 --> 00:41:59,850
Missing somebody?

641
00:42:00,977 --> 00:42:03,604
You know, I've not seen
will or court this morning.

642
00:42:03,896 --> 00:42:05,833
That's funny, I didn't hear
'em come in last night either.

643
00:42:05,857 --> 00:42:07,835
You apparently wouldn't have
heard shit after all this...

644
00:42:07,859 --> 00:42:08,859
(Charlie slams table)

645
00:42:09,110 --> 00:42:11,738
Anyways, he didn't sneak into
your guy's bunk last night,

646
00:42:12,030 --> 00:42:13,030
did he?

647
00:42:15,575 --> 00:42:17,910
(Sighs) I told them to stay
close.

648
00:42:18,202 --> 00:42:19,202
I'm sure they're fine.

649
00:42:19,370 --> 00:42:20,472
I'll go look for them in a
minute.

650
00:42:20,496 --> 00:42:23,583
I'm sure they just uh,
passed out after their walk.

651
00:42:24,959 --> 00:42:25,585
Anyone of you know how much

652
00:42:25,877 --> 00:42:27,253
a fully grown brown bear weighs?

653
00:42:29,130 --> 00:42:31,883
About 500 pounds. (Sighs)

654
00:42:34,802 --> 00:42:36,804
[Vanessa] Please tell me
you're joking.

655
00:42:37,096 --> 00:42:38,306
Nope.

656
00:42:38,598 --> 00:42:39,918
But do I think something
happened?

657
00:42:39,974 --> 00:42:40,974
Not really.

658
00:42:41,184 --> 00:42:42,619
But it's something that needs
to be on all of your minds

659
00:42:42,643 --> 00:42:44,854
if you decide to trek
out into the woods alone.

660
00:42:46,981 --> 00:42:49,108
Well uh, I'll make sure
to keep that in mind,

661
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:50,693
but do we, by chance have, like,

662
00:42:50,985 --> 00:42:54,238
a rifle on site, or
something, just in case?

663
00:42:58,618 --> 00:43:00,745
Forgot, ex-con.

664
00:43:01,037 --> 00:43:02,455
Tell you what, Chuck,

665
00:43:02,747 --> 00:43:04,387
why don't you use your winning
personality

666
00:43:04,582 --> 00:43:05,583
if you run into wildlife?

667
00:43:05,875 --> 00:43:07,251
It should be a solid deterrent.

668
00:43:08,961 --> 00:43:10,963
By the way, you smell like
Mason's dick.

669
00:43:11,255 --> 00:43:14,050
Oh, better than smelling
like loneliness and depression.

670
00:43:14,342 --> 00:43:16,844
(Women chuckle)

671
00:43:18,304 --> 00:43:22,725
(Vanessa mutters)
(Door clatters)

672
00:43:23,017 --> 00:43:27,855
(Woman screaming)
(Chairs clatter)

673
00:43:29,357 --> 00:43:32,985
- [Woman] Help me, help me!
- (Screaming)

674
00:43:33,277 --> 00:43:33,945
Help me!

675
00:43:34,237 --> 00:43:35,917
- Hey, hey, whoa whoa whoa!
- Let go of me!

676
00:43:36,155 --> 00:43:38,783
Easy, easy. (Woman screaming)

677
00:43:39,075 --> 00:43:42,411
(Dramatic, ominous music)

678
00:43:46,707 --> 00:43:49,585
- Let me go!
- Chill! (Grunts)

679
00:43:49,877 --> 00:43:52,880
You don't understand, it's out
there!

680
00:43:54,006 --> 00:43:56,008
My friends, they're all...

681
00:43:58,136 --> 00:43:59,154
- (Gil groaning)
- Jesus Gil,

682
00:43:59,178 --> 00:44:00,263
are you okay?

683
00:44:00,555 --> 00:44:02,014
- God.
- Come help me.

684
00:44:03,975 --> 00:44:05,059
Get him up.

685
00:44:05,351 --> 00:44:07,770
(Gil grunting)

686
00:44:09,772 --> 00:44:11,899
Somebody get her up and
let's get her to the med-bed.

687
00:44:12,191 --> 00:44:14,068
(Groaning) Who the fuck is
this bitch?

688
00:44:14,360 --> 00:44:16,529
[Mason] You're taking
grandpa, I'll carry her.

689
00:44:16,821 --> 00:44:21,659
(Gentle, dramatic music)
(Birds chirping)

690
00:44:24,120 --> 00:44:26,455
(Men grunt)

691
00:44:26,747 --> 00:44:31,127
[Gil] Jesus. (Grunts)

692
00:44:31,419 --> 00:44:34,589
(Gentle, ominous music)

693
00:44:40,011 --> 00:44:44,432
(Lighter clicks)
(Gentle, ominous music)

694
00:44:44,724 --> 00:44:45,724
Will!

695
00:44:48,853 --> 00:44:50,521
Will, where are you?

696
00:45:00,489 --> 00:45:03,034
(Mason grunts)

697
00:45:06,287 --> 00:45:11,209
(Labored breathing)
(Quiet, ominous music)

698
00:45:13,127 --> 00:45:15,213
She's so bloody.

699
00:45:15,504 --> 00:45:17,048
Laceration on her forehead,

700
00:45:18,299 --> 00:45:19,717
laceration on left thigh.

701
00:45:21,969 --> 00:45:23,221
(Vanessa sighs)

702
00:45:23,512 --> 00:45:24,512
You okay?

703
00:45:24,764 --> 00:45:27,266
[Vanessa] Yeah, just a
little unexpected is all.

704
00:45:31,479 --> 00:45:33,022
Are you okay?

705
00:45:33,314 --> 00:45:34,315
[Miley] I'll be fine.

706
00:45:35,650 --> 00:45:38,110
What the hell happened to her?

707
00:45:38,402 --> 00:45:41,572
(Gentle, ominous music)

708
00:45:45,952 --> 00:45:46,952
Courtney!

709
00:45:48,496 --> 00:45:49,496
Will!

710
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,044
Was that roast beef an all-night
buffet?

711
00:45:56,671 --> 00:46:00,424
(Gentle, ominous music)

712
00:46:00,716 --> 00:46:01,926
She's stable for now.

713
00:46:02,218 --> 00:46:04,553
Let's check back on her in a few
hours.

714
00:46:04,845 --> 00:46:06,597
Afew hours?

715
00:46:06,889 --> 00:46:07,556
What the fuck did you hit her
with?

716
00:46:07,848 --> 00:46:08,849
[Vanessa] A sedative.

717
00:46:10,476 --> 00:46:12,019
Okay, so what do we do now?

718
00:46:14,397 --> 00:46:16,357
[Gil] I think it's
time to make that call.

719
00:46:16,649 --> 00:46:17,650
[Miley] Agreed.

720
00:46:17,942 --> 00:46:19,902
Tash, can you go and get the
sat. Phone?

721
00:46:21,612 --> 00:46:24,365
You two, I want everyone back
at this camp before sunset,

722
00:46:24,657 --> 00:46:26,659
no more wandering around.

723
00:46:26,951 --> 00:46:28,786
Go get Charlie, look
for will and Courtney,

724
00:46:29,078 --> 00:46:31,080
bring 'em back here to
the nurse's station.

725
00:46:33,416 --> 00:46:35,668
(Vanessa sighs)

726
00:46:35,960 --> 00:46:39,130
(Gentle, ominous music)

727
00:46:46,137 --> 00:46:47,388
What the fuck?

728
00:46:47,680 --> 00:46:52,518
(Rustling leaves)
(Gentle, ominous music)

729
00:46:55,104 --> 00:46:56,230
Jesus fucking Christ.

730
00:46:57,523 --> 00:47:00,735
(Leaves rustling)

731
00:47:01,027 --> 00:47:03,529
(Zipper buzzes)

732
00:47:06,115 --> 00:47:06,741
Oh shit.

733
00:47:07,033 --> 00:47:08,492
I guess we're doing this.

734
00:47:11,912 --> 00:47:13,164
You all right?

735
00:47:14,498 --> 00:47:18,002
I don't know, just
something's not right.

736
00:47:19,003 --> 00:47:21,464
Other than the obvious?

737
00:47:21,756 --> 00:47:24,884
Maybe I'm being paranoid,
but (chuckles non-humorously)

738
00:47:25,176 --> 00:47:26,886
She comes running out of
nowhere,

739
00:47:27,178 --> 00:47:28,554
damn near ferrel,

740
00:47:28,846 --> 00:47:32,183
talking about something being
out in the woods. (Sighs)

741
00:47:34,352 --> 00:47:36,633
We're about 50 miles away
from the nearest civilization,

742
00:47:36,854 --> 00:47:38,014
it's not really painting a...

743
00:47:38,189 --> 00:47:40,524
Gil, you might wanna come look
at this.

744
00:47:42,443 --> 00:47:43,443
What now?

745
00:47:45,404 --> 00:47:46,822
Clean up, you look like shit.

746
00:47:48,157 --> 00:47:50,868
I'll figure out what's going on.

747
00:47:51,160 --> 00:47:54,497
(Quiet, foreboding music)

748
00:47:58,751 --> 00:48:02,713
- Oh shit.
- (Quiet, foreboding music)

749
00:48:08,469 --> 00:48:11,889
What the fuck?
(Dramatic, menacing music)

750
00:48:12,181 --> 00:48:15,017
(Charlie screaming)

751
00:48:18,813 --> 00:48:23,734
(Quiet, eerie music)
(Insects singing)

752
00:48:33,994 --> 00:48:34,994
You okay?

753
00:48:35,788 --> 00:48:38,833
Yeah, my ankle still hurts a
bit.

754
00:48:39,917 --> 00:48:40,918
Let me see.

755
00:48:41,210 --> 00:48:44,130
(Gentle, quiet music)

756
00:48:44,422 --> 00:48:47,174
Oh yeah, definitely a sprain.

757
00:48:47,466 --> 00:48:49,885
(Miley grunts)

758
00:48:50,177 --> 00:48:51,177
Sorry.

759
00:48:51,804 --> 00:48:52,804
Um, you're fine.

760
00:48:53,764 --> 00:48:56,016
You think you could get
my shoulders instead?

761
00:48:56,308 --> 00:48:57,768
I just feel so tense.

762
00:48:58,060 --> 00:48:59,270
Yeah, sure.

763
00:48:59,562 --> 00:49:02,565
(Gentle, quiet music)

764
00:49:07,027 --> 00:49:09,113
(Miley groans)

765
00:49:09,405 --> 00:49:11,407
You don't feel that tense.

766
00:49:13,242 --> 00:49:14,827
Let me ask you something.

767
00:49:15,119 --> 00:49:16,119
Go for it.

768
00:49:17,204 --> 00:49:18,204
Why Tasha?

769
00:49:20,374 --> 00:49:21,000
What?

770
00:49:21,292 --> 00:49:23,461
You and Tasha, I don't get it.

771
00:49:25,838 --> 00:49:27,631
Miles, it's not like we're...

772
00:49:27,923 --> 00:49:30,009
There's nothing special about
her

773
00:49:30,301 --> 00:49:32,595
and there's nothing that
she can do that I can't.

774
00:49:33,804 --> 00:49:34,972
Or better.

775
00:49:35,264 --> 00:49:38,267
(Gentle, quiet music)

776
00:49:41,061 --> 00:49:45,983
Miles look, there's just
nothing here between you and I.

777
00:49:47,359 --> 00:49:48,569
I mean...

778
00:49:48,861 --> 00:49:49,861
There could be.

779
00:49:50,738 --> 00:49:53,824
(Gentle, quiet music)

780
00:49:54,742 --> 00:49:56,035
[Mason] (Sighs) No, Miley,

781
00:49:56,327 --> 00:49:58,412
we are in two different leagues.

782
00:49:58,704 --> 00:50:01,874
You need a good guy and
I am not a good guy.

783
00:50:02,166 --> 00:50:03,792
Maybe I don't want a good guy.

784
00:50:04,084 --> 00:50:05,503
[Mason] And I don't want you.

785
00:50:06,837 --> 00:50:07,837
I'm sorry.

786
00:50:08,047 --> 00:50:10,591
Fine, have fun with your
cum guzzling gutter slut!

787
00:50:14,970 --> 00:50:16,013
What did you do now?

788
00:50:17,515 --> 00:50:21,018
(Gentle, foreboding music)

789
00:50:23,103 --> 00:50:28,025
(Door clatters)
(Gentle, foreboding music)

790
00:50:32,321 --> 00:50:34,907
(Door rattles)
(Gentle, foreboding music)

791
00:50:35,199 --> 00:50:40,037
(Grass rustling)
(Gentle, foreboding music)

792
00:50:47,962 --> 00:50:50,089
(Shrieks) Where the fuck am I?

793
00:50:50,381 --> 00:50:51,781
- Stay down.
- Who the fuck are you?

794
00:50:52,007 --> 00:50:54,635
[Vanessa] I'm nurse Vanessa
hemsgrove.

795
00:50:54,927 --> 00:50:57,263
You're at pine hills camp.

796
00:50:57,555 --> 00:50:58,715
- (Fist thumps)
- Ow! (Grunts)

797
00:50:58,889 --> 00:50:59,969
Gil, give her some space.

798
00:51:00,057 --> 00:51:02,226
[Gil] Bitch, would you stop
hitting me?

799
00:51:03,644 --> 00:51:04,270
[Woman] What did you hit me
with?

800
00:51:04,562 --> 00:51:05,563
A sedative.

801
00:51:05,854 --> 00:51:07,523
The effects have not worn off
yet.

802
00:51:07,815 --> 00:51:09,900
I promise, no one's gonna hurt
you.

803
00:51:10,192 --> 00:51:11,777
[Mason] What happened?

804
00:51:12,069 --> 00:51:14,113
[Gil] Bitch just went
in with a hair trigger.

805
00:51:14,405 --> 00:51:15,739
- Sorry.
- Jesus.

806
00:51:16,031 --> 00:51:17,866
[Vanessa] Can you tell me your
name?

807
00:51:18,158 --> 00:51:18,784
Jane.

808
00:51:19,076 --> 00:51:19,618
[Gil] Oh, I swear to god,

809
00:51:19,910 --> 00:51:21,620
if you say your last name is
Doe...

810
00:51:21,912 --> 00:51:23,247
Fuck off.

811
00:51:23,539 --> 00:51:25,339
[Vanessa] What are you
doing out here, Jane?

812
00:51:26,667 --> 00:51:28,043
We were on vacation.

813
00:51:29,837 --> 00:51:31,589
My friends and I were camping.

814
00:51:32,840 --> 00:51:33,840
Something,

815
00:51:35,676 --> 00:51:36,844
something attacked us.

816
00:51:37,136 --> 00:51:38,363
There's something in the woods.

817
00:51:38,387 --> 00:51:39,387
Whoa whoa whoa, sit.

818
00:51:40,681 --> 00:51:42,433
What kind of something?

819
00:51:43,601 --> 00:51:47,521
I don't know, some animal, a
monster.

820
00:51:47,813 --> 00:51:49,898
What the hell are you
talking about, what monster?

821
00:51:50,190 --> 00:51:52,860
It hunted us down.

822
00:51:53,152 --> 00:51:54,778
It killed my friends.

823
00:51:56,196 --> 00:51:57,196
It killed,

824
00:52:00,117 --> 00:52:01,118
Alex.

825
00:52:01,410 --> 00:52:03,704
[Vanessa] I need to know
exactly what happened,

826
00:52:03,996 --> 00:52:05,372
are there others out there?

827
00:52:05,664 --> 00:52:08,083
They're dead, they're all dead.

828
00:52:08,375 --> 00:52:11,587
[Vanessa] Gil, we've
gotta call somebody.

829
00:52:11,879 --> 00:52:13,047
Where's the sat. Phone?

830
00:52:15,424 --> 00:52:16,424
Smashed.

831
00:52:17,259 --> 00:52:17,885
- I don't know how...
- What?

832
00:52:18,177 --> 00:52:19,177
It's a no go.

833
00:52:19,928 --> 00:52:22,389
[Vanessa] Oh my god,
will, Courtney, Charlie?

834
00:52:24,600 --> 00:52:25,768
Nobody's come back yet.

835
00:52:27,353 --> 00:52:29,271
God, what is going on?

836
00:52:31,065 --> 00:52:32,900
[Gil] Hell if I know.

837
00:52:34,777 --> 00:52:36,070
There are people missing.

838
00:52:37,696 --> 00:52:39,698
She shows up, talking about her
friends

839
00:52:39,990 --> 00:52:41,492
are being killed by some
monster?

840
00:52:42,576 --> 00:52:44,179
[Gil] I really don't think
she's the most reliable source

841
00:52:44,203 --> 00:52:45,746
of information right now,
Vanessa.

842
00:52:47,122 --> 00:52:50,042
[Vanessa] Even so, I have
three counselors missing

843
00:52:50,334 --> 00:52:53,629
and after what I've seen
the past few hours...

844
00:52:53,921 --> 00:52:55,441
[Gil] What are you talking
about now?

845
00:52:55,506 --> 00:52:57,216
Come look at this.

846
00:52:57,508 --> 00:53:00,844
(Quiet, foreboding music)

847
00:53:06,809 --> 00:53:07,810
The fuck is that?

848
00:53:08,102 --> 00:53:10,229
I don't know, but it
came out of Jane's leg.

849
00:53:11,939 --> 00:53:13,065
She's sick, contagious?

850
00:53:14,441 --> 00:53:15,441
I don't know.

851
00:53:17,444 --> 00:53:18,946
(Gil snaps fingers)

852
00:53:19,238 --> 00:53:21,407
No bullshit, what is that all
overyou?

853
00:53:21,699 --> 00:53:22,700
Pick a friend.

854
00:53:24,118 --> 00:53:25,994
Let's hear about this monster
of yours.

855
00:53:27,329 --> 00:53:29,123
(Miley crying)

856
00:53:29,415 --> 00:53:30,457
(Distant popping)

857
00:53:30,749 --> 00:53:31,749
Tasha?

858
00:53:33,460 --> 00:53:35,212
Just go away, okay?

859
00:53:37,756 --> 00:53:39,591
You were right, (crying)

860
00:53:39,883 --> 00:53:44,555
I'm not a gazelle, I'm just
a fucking elephant. (Crying)

861
00:53:47,307 --> 00:53:51,395
(Ominous, foreboding music)
Tasha?

862
00:53:56,608 --> 00:54:01,530
(Miley screaming)
(Dramatic, menacing music)

863
00:54:03,073 --> 00:54:04,950
That's the last thing I
remember.

864
00:54:05,242 --> 00:54:08,787
I woke up, heard some
not-too-friendly shit in the woods,

865
00:54:09,079 --> 00:54:12,082
stumbled up on you
people, and here we are.

866
00:54:12,374 --> 00:54:16,086
(Chuckles) No, I call
bullshit, it's gotta be bullshit.

867
00:54:17,337 --> 00:54:19,923
But you said you killed
the thing, though, right?

868
00:54:20,215 --> 00:54:21,508
[Jane] As far as I know.

869
00:54:21,800 --> 00:54:22,800
There wasn't much left.

870
00:54:24,136 --> 00:54:25,136
Gil?

871
00:54:26,972 --> 00:54:27,598
I'll start the car.

872
00:54:27,890 --> 00:54:30,058
Whoa whoa whoa whoa, what?

873
00:54:31,018 --> 00:54:32,978
You don't actually believe
this horseshit, do you?

874
00:54:33,145 --> 00:54:34,998
Listen, Abercrombie, you
wanna hang around here,

875
00:54:35,022 --> 00:54:35,606
be my guest.

876
00:54:35,898 --> 00:54:36,607
What about the others,

877
00:54:36,899 --> 00:54:38,501
we're just gonna fuckin'
take off and leave 'em?

878
00:54:38,525 --> 00:54:41,695
Mason's right, Gil, I'm not
leaving those kids out there.

879
00:54:41,987 --> 00:54:42,987
We gotta go find them.

880
00:54:43,155 --> 00:54:45,282
So we go out there and risk
something

881
00:54:45,574 --> 00:54:47,075
happening to all of us?

882
00:54:47,367 --> 00:54:50,037
I am with Gil, I say we
hightail it the fuck outta here.

883
00:54:51,163 --> 00:54:52,164
And what if it was you?

884
00:54:52,456 --> 00:54:54,583
If I was stupid enough
to go out there alone,

885
00:54:54,875 --> 00:54:56,515
I'd expect you to spill one for
your homey

886
00:54:56,710 --> 00:54:58,003
and get the fuck outta dodge.

887
00:54:59,087 --> 00:54:59,713
Bitch.

888
00:55:00,005 --> 00:55:01,715
Hey, don't sit there and act
like

889
00:55:02,007 --> 00:55:05,344
you'd be all heroic for me
if I was the one out there.

890
00:55:05,636 --> 00:55:07,513
You can't go out there.

891
00:55:07,805 --> 00:55:10,432
If there are more of those
out there, believe me,

892
00:55:10,724 --> 00:55:12,935
your friends are more than
likely dead.

893
00:55:13,227 --> 00:55:15,145
Well, (sighs) I'm not gonna
sit here

894
00:55:15,437 --> 00:55:17,523
and listen to this horseshit
anymore.

895
00:55:17,815 --> 00:55:19,942
There are no goddamn monsters
out here

896
00:55:20,234 --> 00:55:22,234
and I'm not gonna bolt all
because some crack whore

897
00:55:22,277 --> 00:55:23,779
decided she was gonna run into
camp

898
00:55:24,071 --> 00:55:25,364
and tell us all about her
friends

899
00:55:25,656 --> 00:55:27,533
that got killed by some Gil-man.

900
00:55:27,825 --> 00:55:29,284
(Door clatters)

901
00:55:29,576 --> 00:55:31,745
Actually, they were ripped apan.

902
00:55:35,249 --> 00:55:36,249
Vanessa.

903
00:55:36,917 --> 00:55:37,917
Gil, please.

904
00:55:39,920 --> 00:55:41,338
Goddamn it, all right, fine,

905
00:55:42,464 --> 00:55:44,104
Vanessa and I will go look for
the others,

906
00:55:44,174 --> 00:55:46,093
you guys stay here in case they
come back.

907
00:55:46,385 --> 00:55:49,221
Nice try, handsome,
but I'm not staying here.

908
00:55:49,513 --> 00:55:52,224
Didn't you just say it was
smarter not to go out there?

909
00:55:52,516 --> 00:55:54,160
- (Chuckles, unamused)
- And I still stand by that.

910
00:55:54,184 --> 00:55:56,562
However, I'd be more
comfortable with you out there

911
00:55:56,854 --> 00:55:57,854
than stuck here.

912
00:55:58,564 --> 00:55:59,731
[Vanessa] Where's Miley?

913
00:56:00,023 --> 00:56:02,168
Last I saw her, she was
headed towards the bathhouse.

914
00:56:02,192 --> 00:56:03,735
Can you please go get her?

915
00:56:04,027 --> 00:56:06,405
The last thing we need is
to be separated right now.

916
00:56:10,117 --> 00:56:11,477
I'm gonna go get some more
supplies

917
00:56:11,743 --> 00:56:13,787
in case anybody else gets hurt.

918
00:56:14,079 --> 00:56:15,559
I don't think a bandaid's
gonna cure

919
00:56:15,664 --> 00:56:17,541
what's more than likely happened
to them.

920
00:56:18,792 --> 00:56:20,794
Our thoughts stay positive,
please.

921
00:56:21,086 --> 00:56:22,086
Stay with her.

922
00:56:23,672 --> 00:56:26,592
I guess I'm gonna get
flashlights.

923
00:56:30,262 --> 00:56:32,848
(Door clatters)

924
00:56:34,975 --> 00:56:37,477
(Chair creaks)

925
00:56:39,271 --> 00:56:41,189
Sorry about the whole crack
whore jab.

926
00:56:53,118 --> 00:56:55,579
(Door rattles)

927
00:56:57,748 --> 00:57:01,168
(Quiet, foreboding music)

928
00:57:04,171 --> 00:57:07,257
(Towel dispenser rumbling)

929
00:57:07,549 --> 00:57:12,387
(Water hissing)
(Quiet, foreboding music)

930
00:57:34,826 --> 00:57:39,748
(Jane crying)
(Quiet, foreboding music)

931
00:57:58,392 --> 00:58:00,602
(Zipper buzzes)

932
00:58:00,894 --> 00:58:03,397
(Items rusting)

933
00:58:07,192 --> 00:58:11,571
(Gasps) Jesus, will, where
the hell have you guys been?

934
00:58:11,863 --> 00:58:14,950
(Quiet, foreboding music)

935
00:58:15,242 --> 00:58:16,242
Will?

936
00:58:18,829 --> 00:58:19,829
Oh my god.

937
00:58:20,789 --> 00:58:24,334
(Dramatic, menacing music)

938
00:58:27,504 --> 00:58:32,426
(Vanessa screaming)
(Dramatic, menacing music)

939
00:58:35,804 --> 00:58:40,392
Oh no, please, no!
(Dramatic, menacing music)

940
00:58:40,684 --> 00:58:45,522
(Will growls)
(Vanessa screaming)

941
00:58:48,775 --> 00:58:51,069
Oh my god, oh my god.

942
00:58:51,361 --> 00:58:55,699
(Vanessa screams)
(Will grunting)

943
00:58:55,991 --> 00:58:59,369
(Dramatic, menacing music)

944
00:59:00,454 --> 00:59:05,375
(Vanessa yells)
(Dramatic, menacing music)

945
00:59:06,501 --> 00:59:11,423
(Vanessa screams)
(Dramatic, menacing music)

946
00:59:12,299 --> 00:59:17,220
(Men grunting)
(Dramatic, menacing music)

947
00:59:20,265 --> 00:59:22,434
(Gasps) Oh my god.

948
00:59:22,726 --> 00:59:25,520
(Gasps) Holy shit.

949
00:59:26,646 --> 00:59:31,568
Oh my god, what is happening?
(Crying)

950
00:59:32,235 --> 00:59:36,782
Miley. (Door clatters)

951
00:59:37,074 --> 00:59:37,616
Miley?

952
00:59:37,908 --> 00:59:39,117
What the fuck!?

953
00:59:39,409 --> 00:59:40,619
Vanessa!

954
00:59:40,911 --> 00:59:44,206
(Eerie, distorted music)

955
00:59:44,498 --> 00:59:45,040
(Door clatters)

956
00:59:45,332 --> 00:59:47,417
Jesus fucking Christ. (Grunts)

957
00:59:47,709 --> 00:59:48,709
[Gil] Yeah, he's dead.

958
00:59:48,752 --> 00:59:50,629
Oh no shit, I couldn't
tell from the scissors

959
00:59:50,921 --> 00:59:53,548
sticking out of his fucking
head. (Sighs)

960
00:59:53,840 --> 00:59:55,280
[Vanessa] Whatever happened to
will

961
00:59:56,593 --> 00:59:58,033
has happened to the others out
there.

962
00:59:58,303 --> 01:00:00,138
And what, exactly, is that?

963
01:00:00,430 --> 01:00:02,724
Eh, yeah we're still working
on it.

964
01:00:03,016 --> 01:00:07,854
It attaches itself to the
host and causes severe mutation.

965
01:00:08,146 --> 01:00:09,356
(Sighs) Fuck.

966
01:00:09,648 --> 01:00:12,984
However, without the host
being active,

967
01:00:14,319 --> 01:00:16,321
the parasite can't thrive.

968
01:00:16,613 --> 01:00:18,093
And there's no way to save the
host?

969
01:00:18,156 --> 01:00:20,617
With this severe of a
mutation, I don't think so.

970
01:00:20,909 --> 01:00:22,661
So what happens to the parasite?

971
01:00:22,953 --> 01:00:27,791
(Dramatic, menacing music)
(Parasite screeching)

972
01:00:28,875 --> 01:00:32,587
(Tasha exhales)
(Parasite squishing)

973
01:00:32,879 --> 01:00:33,879
(Distant hissing)

974
01:00:33,922 --> 01:00:38,760
Whoa, they did not like that.

975
01:00:39,427 --> 01:00:40,971
[Mason] Oh my god!

976
01:00:41,263 --> 01:00:44,516
(Eerie, distorted music)

977
01:00:47,769 --> 01:00:49,104
Get the window!

978
01:00:50,313 --> 01:00:51,648
Hey!

979
01:00:51,940 --> 01:00:53,692
(Mason grunts)
(Hyperventilating)

980
01:00:53,984 --> 01:00:55,304
What the fuck's wrong with them?

981
01:00:55,360 --> 01:00:56,360
What was that?

982
01:00:56,444 --> 01:00:59,197
I don't know, and at
this point, I don't care.

983
01:00:59,489 --> 01:01:00,489
Just help me.

984
01:01:03,243 --> 01:01:04,243
[Vanessa] Gil,

985
01:01:06,496 --> 01:01:08,206
this isn't normal.

986
01:01:08,498 --> 01:01:11,251
[Gil] I don't think that
constitutes as normal, tonight.

987
01:01:11,543 --> 01:01:12,543
Look at this.

988
01:01:14,254 --> 01:01:15,547
[Gil] What am I looking for?

989
01:01:15,839 --> 01:01:19,217
His heart, he was still
changing.

990
01:01:19,509 --> 01:01:21,720
It's filled with puncture
wounds and holes.

991
01:01:22,012 --> 01:01:24,055
Whatever that thing was

992
01:01:24,347 --> 01:01:27,517
was filling him full of
hormones and adrenaline.

993
01:01:28,768 --> 01:01:30,163
That's what the fuck
that as throwing me around

994
01:01:30,187 --> 01:01:31,688
like a rag doll.

995
01:01:31,980 --> 01:01:33,580
Yeah, but there's more to it
than that.

996
01:01:34,774 --> 01:01:35,901
What do you mean?

997
01:01:36,193 --> 01:01:38,236
Well think about it for a
second,

998
01:01:39,446 --> 01:01:40,697
(sighs) What's the heart do?

999
01:01:40,989 --> 01:01:41,989
Pumps blood.

1000
01:01:43,241 --> 01:01:46,745
It was feeding oxygen
and blood into his body.

1001
01:01:47,037 --> 01:01:48,038
- Okay.
- Well,

1002
01:01:49,789 --> 01:01:51,109
what was that thing gunning
toward

1003
01:01:51,333 --> 01:01:52,667
when it come out of his mouth?

1004
01:01:54,127 --> 01:01:55,127
[Gil] Tasha?

1005
01:01:56,630 --> 01:01:57,630
What about me?

1006
01:01:59,758 --> 01:02:02,594
It also feeds blood into
certain areas of the body.

1007
01:02:04,012 --> 01:02:05,430
Oh.

1008
01:02:05,722 --> 01:02:06,264
Okay.

1009
01:02:06,556 --> 01:02:08,558
Yeah, which is how it spreads,

1010
01:02:09,726 --> 01:02:12,020
it takes over the entire
reproductive system,

1011
01:02:12,312 --> 01:02:13,872
pumps an excessive amount of
adrenaline,

1012
01:02:13,897 --> 01:02:14,606
hormones into the body,

1013
01:02:14,898 --> 01:02:16,691
overpowers it's prey and infects
them.

1014
01:02:17,734 --> 01:02:18,734
Ew.

1015
01:02:20,487 --> 01:02:22,215
So what you're saying is
this thing has a source,

1016
01:02:22,239 --> 01:02:23,239
like a patient zero?

1017
01:02:24,491 --> 01:02:26,117
I don't know.

1018
01:02:26,409 --> 01:02:27,911
That's about all I got at this
point.

1019
01:02:28,203 --> 01:02:29,371
Shh.

1020
01:02:29,663 --> 01:02:30,663
Listen.

1021
01:02:32,749 --> 01:02:37,671
(Engine humming)
(Quiet, ominous music)

1022
01:02:51,726 --> 01:02:53,019
(Door clatters)

1023
01:02:53,311 --> 01:02:58,149
(Quiet, ominous music)
(Insects singing)

1024
01:03:15,875 --> 01:03:16,875
Bowman!

1025
01:03:17,711 --> 01:03:19,504
Fuck, I gotta go get him. (Slaps
wall)

1026
01:03:19,796 --> 01:03:21,381
You can't go out there.

1027
01:03:21,673 --> 01:03:23,300
Not gonna let him fuckin' die.

1028
01:03:23,591 --> 01:03:26,678
(Quiet, ominous music)

1029
01:03:52,495 --> 01:03:55,290
(Bag rustles)

1030
01:03:55,582 --> 01:03:57,208
(Officer chuckles)

1031
01:03:57,500 --> 01:04:01,046
This outta put you
away for a couple years.

1032
01:04:01,338 --> 01:04:03,548
[Vanessa] Eh, just be safe.

1033
01:04:03,840 --> 01:04:05,550
Yeah, there's (mutters)

1034
01:04:05,842 --> 01:04:10,680
(Door clattering)
(Quiet, ominous music)

1035
01:04:17,354 --> 01:04:17,979
Whoa, whoa whoa whoa whoa.

1036
01:04:18,271 --> 01:04:19,397
Get your hands up, Gil.

1037
01:04:19,689 --> 01:04:20,398
Bowman, calm down.

1038
01:04:20,690 --> 01:04:22,901
Get your hands up, you fucking
convict.

1039
01:04:23,193 --> 01:04:25,070
Bowman, you gotta listen to
me, man,

1040
01:04:25,362 --> 01:04:28,114
calm down, there's some fucked
up shit happening tonight...

1041
01:04:28,406 --> 01:04:29,406
I don't wanna hear it.

1042
01:04:30,450 --> 01:04:31,650
What the fuck are you doing?

1043
01:04:31,868 --> 01:04:32,970
You're fucking planting
evidence?

1044
01:04:32,994 --> 01:04:34,013
I don't wanna fucking hear it.

1045
01:04:34,037 --> 01:04:36,039
I figure some asshole
like you got it coming,

1046
01:04:36,331 --> 01:04:37,040
you never fucking learn.

1047
01:04:37,332 --> 01:04:38,917
Now get your fuckin' ass over
here,

1048
01:04:39,209 --> 01:04:40,489
put your hands on the table now.

1049
01:04:40,668 --> 01:04:41,812
Don't have time for this...

1050
01:04:41,836 --> 01:04:43,356
[Officer] Put your goddamn
hands on the table, Gil!

1051
01:04:43,380 --> 01:04:45,060
- Shit has went down...
- Put your goddamn,

1052
01:04:45,173 --> 01:04:47,592
fucking hands on the fucking
table, you son of a bitch.

1053
01:04:47,884 --> 01:04:50,095
(Men arguing) (Fist thumps)

1054
01:04:50,387 --> 01:04:51,513
(Gil grunts) Fuck huh?

1055
01:04:51,805 --> 01:04:53,390
Your fucking mouth, goddamn it.

1056
01:04:53,681 --> 01:04:55,183
I've had enough of your shit,
Gil.

1057
01:04:55,475 --> 01:04:56,952
You're making a fucking
mistake, man...

1058
01:04:56,976 --> 01:04:57,602
