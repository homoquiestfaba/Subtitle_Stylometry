1
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:40,500
Jacob! Wait!

2
00:02:15,827 --> 00:02:18,049
Check this out guys!

3
00:02:36,558 --> 00:02:39,669
Hey! Come here!

4
00:02:46,596 --> 00:02:47,608
Jacob!

5
00:02:49,516 --> 00:02:50,827
Jacob!

6
00:02:59,535 --> 00:03:05,346
Hellion

7
00:03:22,755 --> 00:03:25,266
This time we talk about
school suspension.

8
00:03:26,674 --> 00:03:28,585
Six months in Rawlins.

9
00:03:29,793 --> 00:03:32,005
Sheriff Armstrong says if you're going to work
might consider

10
00:03:32,313 --> 00:03:33,524
I was the only one there.

11
00:03:34,732 --> 00:03:35,900
Do not bullshit me.

12
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,200
Do not betray my goal.

13
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:44,182
Look at me.

14
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,150
You almost got involved in all this brother.

15
00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:56,200
Is that what you wanted?

16
00:04:01,510 --> 00:04:03,621
Take responsibility, Jacob.

17
00:04:15,450 --> 00:04:16,060
OK.

18
00:04:30,268 --> 00:04:32,779
Forget it.
Fucking asshole.

19
00:04:42,587 --> 00:04:43,598
Jacob.

20
00:04:44,207 --> 00:04:45,918
Leave me alone.
-Jacob.

21
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:49,600
Stop. Step back, Jacob.

22
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:50,900
How should I drive?

23
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,600
So sabereš, that's how.

24
00:04:56,900 --> 00:04:59,600
My mom gave it to me.
I hate you.

25
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,100
I fucking hate you.

26
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:06,300
Fuck you.

27
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,800
Listen, I did not want to push the way.

28
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:13,100
I will accept responsibility for their actions,
and the consequences of those actions.

29
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:16,000
Again.

30
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:21,500
I will accept responsibility for their actions
and the consequences of these actions.

31
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:23,600
Got something to say, son?

32
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:30,700
All you hear.

33
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:39,300
Since your first week,
loosen'll tell you, okay?

34
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:44,050
Son, it is easy from this side of the fence,
understand?

35
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:48,700
Evening can come home, sleep
in your comfortable bed.

36
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:53,200
But you better start caring,
or you'll end up

37
00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:54,800
in juvenile detention, play
with the big boys.

38
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,450
Sure you do not go home to Mummy and Daddy.

39
00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:00,500
You'll be locked.

40
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:03,700
Crying and commentaries in
bed every night.

41
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:08,400
The  ground. 50 pushups.

42
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:15,000
Now!

43
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:18,900
Again.

44
00:07:18,950 --> 00:07:23,100
I will accept responsibility for their actions
and the consequences of these actions.

45
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:25,300
Again.

46
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:29,950
I will accept responsibility for their actions
and the consequences of these actions.

47
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:55,800
Come on, let's go.

48
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,300
In your bed.

49
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:14,950
Hey, go back to sleep.

50
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:07,000
Four. Fuck.

51
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:11,250
I give her foursome.

52
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
You like this?

53
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:22,750
Hey, put that shit.

54
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:25,700
Okay.
He's my fucking brother.

55
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:28,900
Get up, go home.
I want to stay with you.

56
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:30,900
I said no. Go.

57
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:36,300
Did you hear that Rick Martin was stabbed in
Juvenile last year.

58
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:39,000
's Fucking dead, man.

59
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:44,850
Who is next?
I did. Go home.

60
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:50,200
Sorry, baby. Give me a little.
-Take Your bag.

61
00:10:55,700 --> 00:10:57,700
's Getting faster.
-Fucking True.

62
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Totally should be racing again.
I know.

63
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,400
Fuck, look!

64
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:19,100
What would she worked.
Will you talk to her?

65
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
I do not know.

66
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:26,100
Show us your tits.
What the fuck Lance? You stupid idiot.

67
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:30,250
Leaving. Bravo.
-Don't Be such. Come back.

68
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:36,500
Wait a minute.
Look, look.

69
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:42,500
Hi. Hey honey. What nonsense
up to now?

70
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:44,000
Just hang out.

71
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:48,500
Yes, keeping in touch.
That's all, I swear.

72
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:52,700
Where's your dad?
Fuck if I know.

73
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:57,900
You created quite a reputation.

74
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:06,100
Come on Jacob. Hey, Jacob.
Yes, whatever.

75
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:15,350
Man, is pretty.
Shut up. That's his aunt.

76
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:37,800
Come on, sit down.
I'm not hungry.

77
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:42,500
You gotta eat something.
Do not get up.

78
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:05,100
Here. Take.

79
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:11,820
Dad today was in Galveston.
-Wes.

80
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:16,850
Another one I will try to arrange the house.

81
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:20,900
God had destroyed a reason.

82
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:27,800
We will be moving there.
-Wes, Eat dinner.

83
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:33,700
I'm not moving there.
Sit down!

84
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:45,650
Asshole.
What did you say?

85
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
How many times you gonna let
that stupid song?

86
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:08,850
Leave your brother alone.
Wes, straightening up.

87
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:10,700
Hey, Wes, get up. Come on.

88
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,400
Wes, let's go.

89
00:15:17,550 --> 00:15:18,500
Hurry.

90
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:25,200
OK. Come on.

91
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:48,900
You alone.

92
00:15:58,250 --> 00:16:00,350
You want to be a member of the team.

93
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:05,650
Will not do it.
Shut up.

94
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:32,450
Shit, he did it.

95
00:16:35,850 --> 00:16:38,950
Shit. Hurry.
We have to go.

96
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:48,850
Hey, come here.

97
00:16:49,650 --> 00:16:52,810
Jacob!
Come on Wes, let's go.

98
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:07,350
Come on, go faster.

99
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:20,500
Small, call the police.
-Take Bike.

100
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:44,300
Listen, do not tell anyone. Anyone.

101
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:54,800
Okay. I swear.
I will not let anything happen to you.

102
00:17:56,900 --> 00:17:58,400
Hey.

103
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:01,000
You did good.

104
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:06,000
Now stop crying and go to sleep.

105
00:18:17,350 --> 00:18:22,900
Jacob? What that really go

106
00:18:23,850 --> 00:18:25,300
I'm not.

107
00:18:47,150 --> 00:18:49,200
Do you want ham or peanut butter?
-Šunku.

108
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:12,000
I want to go a little bit.
-I You ham.

109
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:48,100
Who is this?
I do not know.

110
00:20:04,550 --> 00:20:05,850
Hi guys.

111
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:12,200
I'm Mrs. Roberts and this is
cop Gardner. How are you?

112
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:16,300
Is this yours?

113
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:22,500
Not.

114
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:28,550
Well, I'll leave it here in case
it still is. How do you want.

115
00:20:29,850 --> 00:20:32,550
Is your father at home?
Why are you here?

116
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:35,550
Let's go inside.
What do you want?

117
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,000
Okay.

118
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:05,500
I told you not to
can not be here.

119
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:09,800
Daddy will come later,
can then return.

120
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:26,850
Can I talk to you?

121
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:29,900
Go there.

122
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:46,100
You can do it!
-Jacob!

123
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:55,000
Get in the car. No!
Come on Jacob.

124
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:01,000
's Fine, let him.

125
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:09,800
Pam!

126
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:16,600
Where is he? Calm down!
-Wes, Get off!

127
00:22:16,635 --> 00:22:20,500
Hollis, he sleeps.
What do you think you're doing?

128
00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:24,200
Do you think it was my idea?
CPS we had just left.

129
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:31,050
And you've got to pull yourself together.
I can not constantly play nanny.

130
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:35,200
Can I take care of the boys.
-Wes Will shortly be with me, that's all.

131
00:22:35,250 --> 00:22:38,150
I can look after their children.
Really? Can you?

132
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:43,500
Rebecca would be broke your heart, and you know it.

133
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:48,950
Too much loved boys
to watching you abandoned them.

134
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:55,100
You told them? This is what,
you said that social workers?

135
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:59,700
Slow Hollis. I did not say anything to them.

136
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:06,100
Calm.

137
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,700
What did they say?
-Idi To bed.

138
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:51,250
When he returns?
-Idi In bed, Jacob!

139
00:24:25,150 --> 00:24:28,550
Hollis -Nikome not bother.

140
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:32,750
Neighbors complain again, you have to turn off the music and
get in there, son.

141
00:24:32,900 --> 00:24:35,400
This is a free country,
I can do anything I want.

142
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:39,700
Do not make trouble, we do not want you back
bring if we do not.

143
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:57,900
Did you get your name?
Worthless coward!

144
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:04,000
You have anything to say, Harold?
Tell me in the face!

145
00:25:04,150 --> 00:25:08,100
Hol... Holis. That's enough.

146
00:25:08,850 --> 00:25:11,500
Come inside and take a nap. Come on.

147
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:14,700
Get your hands off me.

148
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:22,100
Go. No
Come on. -Get Your hands off me.

149
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:29,250
I'm going... I'm going.

150
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:08,150
Colleague was supposed to be there,
sorry I'm late.

151
00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:18,700
You know you can not afford to
10-year-old is unattended.

152
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:24,700
I believe, 13-year-old parolee is not a good indicator
custody.

153
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:34,200
He is allowed to keep Jacob.

154
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:38,900
But you once a week at
advisers appointed by the court.

155
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,550
Do not miss a single meeting.

156
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:47,500
I have to stop drinking.

157
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,300
In a month we will again
make an assessment.

158
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:58,500
You're lucky that the judge
Bradley loves baseball.

159
00:26:58,900 --> 00:27:00,550
He says he was at all
your matches.

160
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:10,100
Listen, I know that you and your family
passed everything.

161
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:15,100
It seems to me that you could use
little help.

162
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:24,000
Contact me and sister in law,
because you're just trying to help.

163
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:29,500
Hollis.

164
00:27:42,100 --> 00:27:45,950
This is only temporary. You know that?

165
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:50,300
Not like last time, right?

166
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:58,300
Hey, have you been practicing dance moves
?

167
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,000
You're better than me.

168
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,600
OK, give me a hug.

169
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:33,050
Be good, right?
Good.

170
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:41,500
What is it, what are you laughing at?
Go to bed.

171
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:12,950
Aunt Pam!

172
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,300
Aunt Pam!

173
00:29:24,100 --> 00:29:27,250
Are you okay?
Can you sit here until you fall asleep?

174
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,050
Course.

175
00:29:47,300 --> 00:29:52,800
Do you want me to read you a story?
Or it can come up with.

176
00:29:57,800 --> 00:29:59,500
Just sitting in that chair.

177
00:30:30,700 --> 00:30:34,200
I want to come home.
-Stišaj Little. -Ti Hold your own.

178
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:38,200
I want to come home.
Go away.

179
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:53,500
Are you still there?
Yeah.

180
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:03,700
Remember how Carmichael
won 24 medals?

181
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:06,450
Before you were born.

182
00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:11,350

again won all 24th

183
00:31:12,850 --> 00:31:13,800

184
00:31:15,300 --> 00:31:17,350
He is an American hero, you know.

185
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:20,100
I mean, who does not respect this guy.

186
00:31:22,650 --> 00:31:27,100
Wes, bookstores are closing soon.
I have to go.

187
00:31:27,150 --> 00:31:27,900
Wes?

188
00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:29,500
What is it?

189
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,500
I'll correct it, right?

190
00:31:37,300 --> 00:31:38,700
Good.

191
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:45,100
Who was it?
-Jacob.

192
00:31:48,500 --> 00:31:50,300
OK kid, let's go.

193
00:31:57,500 --> 00:31:59,750
Ricky runs for victory.

194
00:31:59,850 --> 00:32:03,200
He was not afraid of work, he practiced
more than anyone.

195
00:32:03,250 --> 00:32:04,950
Role model for young people.

196
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,850
Indicates that the life
get as much as you put.

197
00:32:07,900 --> 00:32:10,900
I, 10 titles in
motocross, it's crazy.

198
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:15,250
Whenever you drive, only wants
first to pass the finish line.

199
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:18,800
The big difference between Ricky and all...

200
00:32:19,550 --> 00:32:24,250
AMATEUR MOTOCROSS RACE

201
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:30,300

202

This, Jacob!

203
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:46,550
Good jump.

204
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:54,500
It will be great.

205
00:32:57,500 --> 00:33:01,000
Here it is.
It, Jacob!

206
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:05,500
Jacob!
-Jacob, Are you all right man?

207
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:10,100
Remove your helmet. Too fast you went
the curve. Oh, really?

208
00:33:10,700 --> 00:33:12,250
Come on, get up.

209
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,700
I go again.
Are you sure?

210
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:22,450
I just turn too fast.

211
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:30,600
Have you talked to Lorne?
Yes, we talked yesterday.

212
00:33:30,700 --> 00:33:33,100
What did she say?
I do not know.

213
00:33:33,950 --> 00:33:38,000
Walk? Yes.
Since when? -From yesterday.

214
00:33:38,450 --> 00:33:39,750
Where did you go?

215
00:33:40,050 --> 00:33:42,500
We're not going anywhere.
We were with her.

216
00:33:42,550 --> 00:33:43,650
What do you mean, anywhere?

217
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:45,900
This is... nowhere.

218
00:33:46,250 --> 00:33:48,900
So, you've never been on a real date
but walking.

219
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:51,200
It took a day
so we could go somewhere.

220
00:33:51,250 --> 00:33:52,500
Then you walk.

221
00:33:53,150 --> 00:33:54,150
We were with her.

222
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:57,100
Have you done something?
No.

223
00:33:57,450 --> 00:34:00,000
I would have rolled it in the first 20 minutes.
Shut up.

224
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:04,500
She invited me to a party on Saturday.

225
00:34:04,550 --> 00:34:05,800
Entertainment rich kids.

226
00:34:09,100 --> 00:34:11,600
This is good. Like it?

227
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:14,600
What is this 250? Yes

228
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,200
How?
Much too, that's how.

229
00:34:18,050 --> 00:34:21,800
My mom makes a chocolate cake for
Tim's birthday if anyone wants to come.

230
00:34:22,250 --> 00:34:25,050
I can not. Parents want
some shitty conversation.

231
00:34:26,100 --> 00:34:27,200
Shit.

232
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:32,500
I thought Tim and your mom
interrupt. -Primila Him back.

233
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:34,750
Asshole, treats her like crap.

234
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:39,200
Do you remember when it was
your mom kicked?

235
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:43,350
Your mom did not suffer anyone's shit.
Was totally cool.

236
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:50,250
Jacob Listen, I'm sorry.
Forget it, let's go.

237
00:34:58,350 --> 00:35:02,500
Did you hear that Bailiyi
renovated bowling alley? Really?

238
00:35:03,850 --> 00:35:07,500
Saturday specijal.
-Were Are the worst in the league.

239
00:35:08,900 --> 00:35:14,150
I, you, Rebecca and Janie Donovan.

240
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,550
This has had a good butt.

241
00:35:18,100 --> 00:35:20,850
Every time he took the pink ball and crossed the track

242
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:22,850
I wanted to hurt him.

243
00:35:23,300 --> 00:35:26,450
I've still got the trophy for last place
which Rebecca made.

244
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:29,450
Always said that
are the best losers.

245
00:35:31,100 --> 00:35:31,900
Yes.

246
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:37,900
Yes, it is.

247
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:49,450
Can I say something?

248
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:56,150
Why do not you sell this house?

249
00:35:58,150 --> 00:35:59,700
She wants to continue to live.

250
00:36:02,700 --> 00:36:05,200
This is no longer the home of your dreams
she thought.

251
00:36:18,150 --> 00:36:24,000
You owe me six beers.
Shit. Who here which helps?

252
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:25,800
Seriously, where's my drink?

253
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:48,150
Hey Jacob.

254
00:36:49,750 --> 00:36:51,050
Is Wes here?

255
00:36:54,750 --> 00:36:57,700
I think it is not wise
that is currently associate.

256
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:06,700
Look... I'm gonna beat the
motorcycle race next month.

257
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
This year we're going to look at me
in the national competition.

258
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,600
Do you know who is Ricky Carmichael?

259
00:37:13,700 --> 00:37:17,500
I do not know. It's great.

260
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,100
My mother would be proud of you.

261
00:37:23,250 --> 00:37:26,000
Can I come and hang out with him?

262
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,800
Not today. I'm sorry.

263
00:37:55,500 --> 00:37:59,700
Come on, come on!
Jacob, come on.

264
00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:18,800
What's wrong?

265
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:26,450
Do you want to get some ice cream
after the game?

266
00:38:27,750 --> 00:38:32,300
Can we celebrate?
What to celebrate?

267
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:39,700
I have completed the back porch.
Finally.

268
00:38:43,500 --> 00:38:46,700
Fuck Galveston.
Look out how you express yourself.

269
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:19,600
Do not come into my room.
Let me know if you change your mind.

270
00:39:21,700 --> 00:39:22,700
Dad!

271
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:47,900
Best friend from school
told me a joke.

272
00:39:48,700 --> 00:39:51,500
Really? Yes.
How's it going?

273
00:39:52,700 --> 00:39:55,800
There are 30 cows and 28 chickens.

274
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,550
How not?

275
00:39:58,700 --> 00:40:02,400
How not? I do not know.

276
00:40:05,500 --> 00:40:10,500
There are 30 cows and 28 chickens.
How not?

277
00:40:11,150 --> 00:40:12,200
Not you?

278
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,400
Is that the point? It's not.

279
00:40:22,350 --> 00:40:25,800
There are 30 cows and 28 chickens.

280
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:28,900
I do not know what you're saying.

281
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:31,300
I want to know what's the deal.

282
00:40:32,450 --> 00:40:34,000
There are 30 cows. Right.

283
00:40:34,050 --> 00:40:37,455
20 cows eating chickens.

284
00:40:37,900 --> 00:40:41,900
There are only 30 cows and 28 chickens.

285
00:40:42,500 --> 00:40:46,500
There are 30 cows,
of which 20 are eating chickens.

286
00:40:46,550 --> 00:40:50,900
Yeah, 20 cows eating the chickens!

287
00:40:56,500 --> 00:41:02,050
I have to admit that lan- He told me
was hard enough to paddle

288
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:06,450
but I assure you that I gave it my all and I never spared
force.

289
00:41:06,550 --> 00:41:10,100
I noticed, though my
wind in your face,

290
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:13,600
us electricity and still carries. SWISS FAMILY ROBINSON

291
00:41:16,650 --> 00:41:17,700
Aunt Pam.

292
00:41:19,100 --> 00:41:20,900
Should go to bed.

293
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:23,950
Yes, you're right.

294
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:29,200
I love you.
And I you.

295
00:41:51,450 --> 00:41:54,300
Hey.
-Pst. Put your shoes, let's go.

296
00:42:01,650 --> 00:42:04,700
Wes, do not be a pussy. Come on.

297
00:42:12,300 --> 00:42:15,500
The two of them really enjoy.
Really.

298
00:42:18,100 --> 00:42:19,800
Hey, it could be
me for a few seconds.

299
00:42:20,550 --> 00:42:22,000
're Disgusting.

300
00:42:24,100 --> 00:42:26,550
Katie. Katie.

301
00:42:28,100 --> 00:42:29,200
Shit.

302
00:42:43,750 --> 00:42:46,150
Have you been in an old bookstore
12th Street?

303
00:42:46,700 --> 00:42:48,800
They have a whole department of pirates.

304
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:51,500
And that strange guy Max works there.

305
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:53,850
Showed me his old rap recordings.

306
00:42:56,750 --> 00:43:00,300
She is trying to buy your love
and you're too stupid to see it.

307
00:43:00,900 --> 00:43:05,600
Do Aunt Pam. I bought your helmet
and took care of us when my dad was gone.

308
00:43:05,950 --> 00:43:08,350
You're just jealous because they took me to the amusement park.

309
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:12,450
I do not care for the amusement park or
stupid pirate bookstore.

310
00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:19,400
It's not your mom.

311
00:43:28,300 --> 00:43:29,450
Do you miss her?

312
00:43:33,450 --> 00:43:35,300
I miss my dad.

313
00:44:12,500 --> 00:44:14,800
Did you get the paper for the trip?

314
00:44:30,750 --> 00:44:35,400
Sorry, very late. I had an appointment at 5:30
Carl Raines.

315
00:44:35,650 --> 00:44:40,000
I'm sorry Mr. Wilson had to go.
Waiting for you for 45 minutes.

316
00:44:43,700 --> 00:44:46,200
Carla comes in the morning.
'll Make another appointment.

317
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:49,900
OK? Yes, ma'am.
Good.

318
00:44:57,000 --> 00:45:01,720
I saw him at the window.
He ​​told me -Buy me!

319
00:45:02,150 --> 00:45:04,800
Good looking -Received him favorably.
Good buying.

320
00:45:05,500 --> 00:45:09,500
Anders, talking about leaking
last night or about the gun?

321
00:45:09,700 --> 00:45:11,250
She was favorable.

322
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:15,550
It was a bit lively. Good for him.

323
00:45:16,150 --> 00:45:17,400
You're funny.

324
00:45:18,900 --> 00:45:21,500
You know Danny,
new kid at the barber?

325
00:45:21,800 --> 00:45:26,000
Bought a Smith and Wesson Model
10th beautiful.

326
00:45:26,050 --> 00:45:27,500
'd Better shoot at this from him.

327
00:45:28,100 --> 00:45:31,050
Watch where you direct it.
The kid is here.

328
00:45:32,500 --> 00:45:33,700
Mean Jakieja?

329
00:45:37,300 --> 00:45:38,600
Strong, are you a child?

330
00:45:40,700 --> 00:45:41,850
Have you ever held a gun?

331
00:45:42,200 --> 00:45:44,100
I do not want to play with guns.

332
00:45:44,150 --> 00:45:48,150
One must learn, right?
We have to make a man of him.

333
00:45:48,200 --> 00:45:50,450
This is one way.
Get from under the armpits small.

334
00:45:50,550 --> 00:45:52,500
Come on strong, you're up.

335
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:54,150
Seat.

336
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:55,700
Do it strong.

337
00:45:56,500 --> 00:45:59,100
Go. He was not even charged.

338
00:46:01,700 --> 00:46:05,600
Take it to the right and take the bottom left.

339
00:46:07,400 --> 00:46:10,650
This advice always works.

340
00:46:11,200 --> 00:46:17,500
Hold this tightly close the pipe, and when you're ready
singe just put it this way.

341
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:19,550
Push, do not pull.

342
00:46:19,750 --> 00:46:21,950
OK, that's enough, get him Jacob.

343
00:46:22,950 --> 00:46:24,000
's OK, Dad.

344
00:46:24,100 --> 00:46:25,300
Enough, already has a record.

345
00:46:27,600 --> 00:46:29,100
Go to your room.

346
00:46:29,900 --> 00:46:32,300
Hi Jake.
Good night strong.

347
00:46:32,550 --> 00:46:34,700
Hollis?
Enough me.

348
00:46:39,800 --> 00:46:43,200
These are precious moments.
'll Be back.

349
00:46:43,400 --> 00:46:47,300
These are precious moments.
You're right.

350
00:46:48,700 --> 00:46:50,100
Seriously.

351
00:46:59,700 --> 00:47:02,450
Come on. Time to get up.

352
00:47:04,250 --> 00:47:07,200
Hey, get up, put clothes and shoes.

353
00:47:07,400 --> 00:47:09,400
You should be ready in 10 minutes

354
00:47:10,700 --> 00:47:12,100
I'm serious, Jacob.

355
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,000
Come on Wes!

356
00:47:52,100 --> 00:47:53,400
Go Wes!

357
00:48:30,700 --> 00:48:33,200
Wes, hey.

358
00:48:35,200 --> 00:48:36,765
It was great.

359
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:40,200
You watched the game?
Yes, I saw it all.

360
00:48:41,700 --> 00:48:43,100
How did Hollis?

361
00:48:45,500 --> 00:48:46,600
OK.

362
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:52,700
It was great.
Thanks.

363
00:48:53,600 --> 00:48:55,200
You did a really good man.

364
00:48:57,350 --> 00:49:01,000
Better get going. We need to find a
some families to pizza.

365
00:49:02,450 --> 00:49:06,350
Can be found there, we have no plans.

366
00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:09,000
I can to meet your goal.

367
00:49:10,500 --> 00:49:12,350
I think it's not a good idea.

368
00:49:15,100 --> 00:49:16,250
What do you mean?

369
00:49:17,150 --> 00:49:20,750
I think it is not a good idea
with whatever happens.

370
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:25,550
Just because you give
Court to briefly play mommy

371
00:49:25,560 --> 00:49:28,050
does not mean that...
Do in front of the boys.

372
00:49:35,200 --> 00:49:36,900
I'm his father.

373
00:49:48,600 --> 00:49:50,700
Come here. Give me a hug.

374
00:49:54,500 --> 00:50:00,100
I'm proud of you. I love you.
You know that?

375
00:50:07,500 --> 00:50:10,850
Miss you.
And you, too.

376
00:50:12,450 --> 00:50:14,800
OK. Be nice.

377
00:50:18,200 --> 00:50:19,550
Let's small.

378
00:50:50,450 --> 00:50:53,150
ENFORCEMENT
Sale

379
00:52:30,500 --> 00:52:33,500
You have to accelerate in some corners.
At this bend slow.

380
00:52:34,100 --> 00:52:37,350
I do not know. That's where you're going with external
hand, you need inside.

381
00:52:37,600 --> 00:52:38,800
Let me see.
Shut up.

382
00:52:39,650 --> 00:52:41,950
Do you see this as Carmichael.
Yes, it was great.

383
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:44,400
Stop hiding, let me see.
Let me. Calm down.

384
00:52:45,300 --> 00:52:46,700
This was fast.

385
00:52:47,600 --> 00:52:48,600
Jerk.

386
00:52:49,200 --> 00:52:50,600
Shit, Lance.

387
00:52:51,700 --> 00:52:52,700
Shit.

388
00:52:55,100 --> 00:52:59,300
Get off him.

389
00:53:05,700 --> 00:53:06,900
You're in luck.

390
00:53:08,450 --> 00:53:11,000
Your friend Lance takes all the blame.

391
00:53:13,800 --> 00:53:17,000
I do not want you ever
seen in this park.

392
00:53:18,200 --> 00:53:21,600
This is a public place for small children,
not for teenage punks.

393
00:53:28,250 --> 00:53:29,650
Okay, get out.

394
00:53:32,700 --> 00:53:36,200
Nathan, Nathan, except you.
Come here, sit down.

395
00:53:36,250 --> 00:53:40,600
Lance, you are.
The rest of you, go away.

396
00:53:53,850 --> 00:53:55,650
Lance's parents are getting a divorce.

397
00:53:57,500 --> 00:53:59,000
This is bullshit, man.

398
00:54:00,500 --> 00:54:04,000
Sher told me that Lance's dad
had an affair with Nathan's mom.

399
00:54:04,500 --> 00:54:05,900
To Sher know?

400
00:54:06,500 --> 00:54:08,800
Her mom works in the theater.
Probably knows everything.

401
00:54:10,250 --> 00:54:11,700
I fucking hate cops.

402
00:54:15,800 --> 00:54:17,900
Old will kill you.

403
00:54:19,200 --> 00:54:20,400
Shut up.

404
00:54:30,400 --> 00:54:32,300
I know it's not like my mom but...

405
00:54:41,250 --> 00:54:42,300
What is it?

406
00:54:45,100 --> 00:54:46,500
You wash my clothes?

407
00:54:47,350 --> 00:54:48,500
The bed's.

408
00:54:53,300 --> 00:54:57,700
Where did you get the plum?
-Neki Kid in the park.

409
00:54:58,600 --> 00:54:59,700
Did you get him back?

410
00:55:03,300 --> 00:55:04,600
Good.

411
00:55:07,800 --> 00:55:10,400
Where did you get the women's makeup?

412
00:55:12,650 --> 00:55:14,100
From Hyder sisters.

413
00:55:18,500 --> 00:55:22,100
She told us about the kid from
"burger palace".

414
00:55:23,400 --> 00:55:26,400
The juvenile had so shattered face
month that he could not speak.

415
00:55:27,200 --> 00:55:29,000
Therefore has a scar.

416
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:39,300
Another kid was stabbed,
died 2 months ago.

417
00:55:40,800 --> 00:55:44,500
Then it's best not to end up there.

418
00:55:50,800 --> 00:55:52,700
You've got to be better.

419
00:56:03,250 --> 00:56:05,300
I have the qualifications for the state for 2 weeks.

420
00:56:11,400 --> 00:56:12,250
Good.

421
00:56:18,450 --> 00:56:21,400
Hey, we need a camera.

422
00:56:21,450 --> 00:56:23,600
Are you there? Get dressed.

423
00:56:24,050 --> 00:56:25,100
Open the door.

424
00:56:29,350 --> 00:56:30,450
The penalties are you?

425
00:56:32,350 --> 00:56:33,350
Can you get out?

426
00:56:34,500 --> 00:56:36,300
My brother takes us on track.

427
00:56:39,450 --> 00:56:41,400
Where's your mom?
I do not know.

428
00:56:42,800 --> 00:56:46,800
Want to come? I told you I'm
! Just take your camera.

429
00:56:47,700 --> 00:56:49,550
Jesus.

430
00:57:52,900 --> 00:57:57,100
OK. I'll come get you, okay?

431
00:58:48,100 --> 00:58:49,200
What are you, Pam?

432
00:58:50,400 --> 00:58:52,600
I need to talk to you.

433
00:58:53,800 --> 00:58:55,200
Important.

434
00:59:00,400 --> 00:59:06,600
So... the other day I was offered a job
in Houston.

435
00:59:10,150 --> 00:59:14,400
I've thought about it.

436
00:59:16,150 --> 00:59:17,800
I will accept it.

437
00:59:19,700 --> 00:59:23,000
Do you remember how we wanted to get out of here
when we were kids?

438
00:59:23,200 --> 00:59:25,400
And you always have Galveston.

439
00:59:29,700 --> 00:59:36,400
Wes lawyer tells me that you missed
meetings, and quarterly estimates.

440
00:59:36,450 --> 00:59:43,400
Says it is in his interest to
come with me to Houston.

441
00:59:44,750 --> 00:59:46,200
Get out of my house.

442
00:59:48,800 --> 00:59:49,900
Out.

443
00:59:50,200 --> 00:59:52,100
Get out!
Wait, Hollis.

444
00:59:54,900 --> 00:59:58,900
You know that Jacob will end up in
juvenile and then what? And Wes?

445
00:59:59,400 --> 01:00:02,600
The next time you come
'll bring him home.

446
01:00:02,700 --> 01:00:04,400
I just want the best for him.

447
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:09,500
Travis went because you did not want children.
Never wanted children, Pam.

448
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:11,800
Why are you trying to take mine?

449
01:00:32,650 --> 01:00:33,850
Dad.

450
01:00:57,800 --> 01:01:02,100
You've Pam and Wes.
Leave us a message.

451
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:06,100
Hey Wes, Jacob.

452
01:01:06,700 --> 01:01:09,250
Just call me, okay?

453
01:01:30,200 --> 01:01:32,250
Look at this ass.

454
01:01:32,300 --> 01:01:34,800
You'll win it.
You have a certain victory.

455
01:01:37,750 --> 01:01:40,900
I heard that Robert Ramirez yesterday
stuffed some kid in the hospital.

456
01:01:41,200 --> 01:01:45,250
Not end up in the hospital
but it is good arranged.

457
01:01:46,500 --> 01:01:48,300
They took Robbie in handcuffs.

458
01:01:48,700 --> 01:01:51,050
Shit. Have you seen?

459
01:01:59,500 --> 01:02:01,050
Have you seen Wes lately?

460
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:02,800
I did.

461
01:02:11,900 --> 01:02:15,150
You got it, man. You'll win the race.

462
01:02:21,700 --> 01:02:23,050
I have to.

463
01:02:35,300 --> 01:02:37,300
Have you seen my belt?
I did.

464
01:02:44,450 --> 01:02:49,150
Did you find tie your mom bought
? Yes, here it is.

465
01:02:51,450 --> 01:02:55,300
I do not know her tie. She told me she did it.

466
01:02:58,850 --> 01:02:59,550
Come here.

467
01:03:03,200 --> 01:03:05,250
Raise your chin.

468
01:03:20,100 --> 01:03:28,009
Here. It's good.

469
01:03:47,750 --> 01:03:49,350
Go.
What did they say?

470
01:03:50,400 --> 01:03:51,600
Dad, where is Wes?

471
01:03:53,750 --> 01:03:55,000
Jacob!

472
01:04:22,850 --> 01:04:24,400
We'll get him back.

473
01:04:36,250 --> 01:04:38,700
Wes.
What are you doing here?

474
01:04:38,850 --> 01:04:40,800
Why do not you call me?

475
01:04:41,600 --> 01:04:43,850
What does that mean?
I do not know.

476
01:04:43,900 --> 01:04:46,100
What do you mean, you do not know?
I do not know.

477
01:04:47,350 --> 01:04:51,400
Listen, I have a race next week.

478
01:04:52,600 --> 01:04:55,350
I will win for you and Dad.
The whole city will see.

479
01:04:56,500 --> 01:04:59,200
Good.
-Trebaš Me there.

480
01:05:00,150 --> 01:05:01,300
You have to tell Pam.

481
01:05:02,450 --> 01:05:03,450
Wes.

482
01:05:05,900 --> 01:05:07,050
Leave me alone.

483
01:05:28,400 --> 01:05:30,800
Hey, Mom is still the bridge,
Are you a beer?

484
01:05:31,200 --> 01:05:32,700
You do not have to go back.

485
01:05:38,550 --> 01:05:41,600
Everything will be sorted out, do not worry.

486
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:48,300
Dressed, you're scaring the children.

487
01:06:11,450 --> 01:06:14,050
Can you drive this?

488
01:06:15,900 --> 01:06:19,000
Come on, get.

489
01:06:30,700 --> 01:06:37,000
If you are just entering, set the radio to 87.5
for today's race.

490
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:46,050
Race 2 just ends
preparing to race No. 3

491
01:06:46,100 --> 01:06:50,400
Open Amateur class for 85cc and larger.

492
01:06:50,500 --> 01:06:58,350
Everyone tries to earn a place on the all-star
amateur national race.

493
01:06:58,900 --> 01:07:03,900
Race 3 at the starting line.

494
01:07:30,300 --> 01:07:33,600
Go Jacob!

495
01:07:47,650 --> 01:07:52,650
AND 40 drivers entering the first turn on
Cowboy Badlands MX track.

496
01:07:57,100 --> 01:08:01,500
Again, the top 12 qualify for the
amateur national race.

497
01:08:06,600 --> 01:08:10,050
Jacob Wilson puts pressure
as it pushes forward.

498
01:08:14,900 --> 01:08:16,900
Jacob!

499
01:08:17,500 --> 01:08:19,850
Gary Owens also in the middle.

500
01:08:24,750 --> 01:08:28,150
Several rounds passed, Gary Owens,
Jason and Jacob Wilson

501
01:08:28,450 --> 01:08:31,500
These are the first three.

502
01:08:35,600 --> 01:08:38,350
Jacob Wilson takes the lead.

503
01:08:39,300 --> 01:08:42,400
Gary Owens is on his track.

504
01:08:47,600 --> 01:08:50,950
Owens
passes and throws Jacob Wilson over the edge.

505
01:10:07,700 --> 01:10:09,200
Is Wes here?

506
01:10:11,500 --> 01:10:12,200
Not.

507
01:10:18,900 --> 01:10:19,900
Go.

508
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:24,200
You were great.

509
01:10:36,100 --> 01:10:42,850
Here. Can I get you anything else?
I think that's all, thank you.

510
01:10:43,300 --> 01:10:45,300
Another Coke.
Course.

511
01:10:51,450 --> 01:10:56,200
My mother would be very proud of you.

512
01:10:57,400 --> 01:10:59,350
Would be proud punk?

513
01:11:06,200 --> 01:11:07,700
Close your mouth while you're eating.

514
01:11:11,250 --> 01:11:12,250
Very nice.

515
01:11:12,900 --> 01:11:14,100
Hyder.

516
01:11:16,800 --> 01:11:23,100
So, how was school boys?
I hate school. Good.

517
01:11:25,750 --> 01:11:30,950
This is ridiculous. Father of the year.

518
01:11:31,400 --> 01:11:31,900
Do here.

519
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:36,550
Why? Everyone knows you're the CPS took the child.
The whole town knows.

520
01:11:37,550 --> 01:11:41,265
Shut up. Immediately.
I do not know how to Galveston. Enough.

521
01:11:41,300 --> 01:11:45,400
Left us.
Stop. Do not tell me what to do.

522
01:11:45,900 --> 01:11:49,350
I was not responsible to take care of everything.

523
01:11:50,550 --> 01:11:53,000
Worry about Wes while you were getting drunk.

524
01:11:53,850 --> 01:11:56,500
OK. Come on.

525
01:11:57,300 --> 01:12:01,150
Three weeks ago, Dad.
Been gone for three weeks.

526
01:12:02,200 --> 01:12:05,600
Admit it, you wanted to get drunk to death.

527
01:12:05,700 --> 01:12:11,900
When Duncan found, you wanted us forever
leave. -We're Clearing. We're not going.

528
01:12:12,900 --> 01:12:18,100
Up. What do we do now?
