1
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:49,800
When I was young

2
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:52,800
I met this beautiful girl by a lake.

3
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:02,720
Scusi! Scusi! Scusi!

4
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:08,400
Dov'è la Svizzera? Ah,

5
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:09,860
No capice.

6
00:01:09,860 --> 00:01:10,770
No Capice?

7
00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:14,190
Uhm, où est la Suisse?

8
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:14,700
S-Switzerland?

9
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:16,800
Oh, Suisse, yeah. Yeah. You got it. Switzerland. La-bas.

10
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:20,700
Hi. Oh, you're American?

11
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:22,800
So are you! Yeah.

12
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:29,800
Keep going that way till you smell money or till you step in chocolate.

13
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:33,800
Okay. Thank you.

14
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:39,800
Ho, watch your head.

15
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:42,700
You okay? I'm fine.

16
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:07,700
Can I sit here?

17
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:12,900
Actually, no.

18
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:16,900
Two years ago, I reserved this specific area.

19
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:21,700
What if I say please? That's the one exception.

20
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:40,400
Oh…Careful there.

21
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:51,800
You find Switzerland?

22
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,900
Ahm…I did.

23
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,700
And claimed it for Missouri. Planted my little flag…

24
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:01,900
and sold beads to the natives.

25
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,800
They had sandwiches there.

26
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:07,900
I brought you some.

27
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:16,800
I'm Ann.

28
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Collins. |Oh, sure, the lady who discovered Switzerland.

29
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:24,000
In all the papers.

30
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
I'm Chris Nielsen.

31
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
How did you know I'd be here?

32
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:34,800
Ahm…I didn't.

33
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Come here, trader.

34
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Oh no, not in the back!!

35
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:46,000
Aah! Let's make it. Oh.

36
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:57,000
I tell you, mom.

37
00:04:58,100 --> 00:05:00,800
You've gotta eat something. |No, I don't. I can get something at school.

38
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:04,100
Yeah, and I know what you'll get! |Oh, Mom, I got a carb up,

39
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:06,100
I got a game. And a math test.

40
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:09,100
Yeah, yeah, I'm ready. I'm cool.

41
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:17,800
Mom, if you pick me up, I won't have to wait|a million hours at his incredibly boring game.

42
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:19,100
I'm sorry, Mary, I have a meeting.

43
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:23,100
And Angie's get us by and is gonna pick you up…|before she gets your brother.

44
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:26,100
I'll let her take the van.

45
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:31,800
And I'll see your chorus thing tomorrow. |I thought you couldn't.

46
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:33,100
Don't worry, I'll get out, I don't wanna miss it.

47
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:37,100
We're late guys. I'll put out the van.

48
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:41,100
Hey, ace it, okay? Yeah.

49
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:44,900
I love you.

50
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:56,100
Do you…you want his breakfast? Mmh.

51
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:04,100
Your mother puts healthy stuff in there. So don't trade-|-trade it for chips and cookies, I know.

52
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:35,100
It was the last time Annie and I saw them alive.

53
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:55,200
When death claims the life of our children

54
00:06:57,900 --> 00:06:59,000
we are left with

55
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:01,800
too many questions.

56
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:07,200
How do we make sense of the feelings we're left with?

57
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:14,900
The Gospel according to Luke, even the First Corinthians,

58
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:19,200
tell us of the extraordinary paradise that awaits us.

59
00:07:58,300 --> 00:08:00,200
Okay. The lucky winner is

60
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:04,200
Jacobs! Stacy Jacobs.

61
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:14,200
Hello, Stacy, I'm doctor Nielsen.

62
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:16,200
Hi.

63
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:18,200
Ah, too late.

64
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,300
Oh, nice stream. I bet he's feeling better. |He's been waited to do that for ten years.

65
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:28,300
Stacy Jacobs!

66
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:33,300
What in the world were you thinking?|It's all right.

67
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:37,300
My kid used to say,|What's the difference, you weren't looking anyway?

68
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:41,100
Do you like rabbits?

69
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:44,300
Yes? Then go like this.

70
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:47,300
Good. Ready.

71
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:49,800
Whooo.

72
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:54,100
We've given her MRIs and…Whoa!

73
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:58,300
Wild rabbit. Watch out. Oh, oh.

74
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:03,300
And also a CAT scan, I believe.

75
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:08,300
Look at that. |Stacy, you have more pictures than a supermodel.

76
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:13,300
Do you ever wear glasses? |No, she doesn't need glasses.

77
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:16,300
Does your head hurt a lot? |All the time.

78
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:17,300
Will you do something for me?

79
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:23,300
I want you to cup your hand, and cover your nose |and mouth like this and just breathe in and out.

80
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:25,300
Mrs. Nielsen on four. Oh, that's my wife.

81
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:29,300
Let's see, if you can do it longer than she can talk,

82
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:31,100
that would be a real achievement.

83
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:36,300
Christy, I've got a meltdown. Okay, take a breath.

84
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:39,300
The eight pieces from Germany never arrived.

85
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:43,300
I've gotta choose replacements the night before the opening.

86
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:46,200
And get them down here, re-hang them and re-light them and I

87
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,100
Okay, focus, okay.

88
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:53,300
Focus. It's out double D-anniversary and I'm ruining it.

89
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:56,300
Double D, yeah. I'm sorry, Christy, I can't leave here.

90
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,200
I'm sorry.

91
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:07,400
Okay, uhm, I'll tell you what, how about this

92
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:11,400
uh. How about the Hudson Rivers?

93
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:13,400
Okay? That gives us three.

94
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:16,400
And the, uh, Hollenbeck…

95
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:23,100
nd the, uh, Hennik 16, 19 and, uh, 23…

96
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:27,400
and the bridge. |But they're all in Fairfield and I don't have anybody to send.

97
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:32,200
Well, I'll drop by after work and |take 'em up and take 'em over to the gallery, huh.

98
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:37,400
You'd do that for me? Only if you're incredibly grateful. Hey,

99
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:43,400
that gives us a chance to show yours. |You've gotta hang it, it's very sexy.

100
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:51,400
Okay, weirdo…

101
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:55,400
I'll be home late, but I'll be home.

102
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:02,400
I love you, Bella. I love you too.

103
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:06,200
Bye. Yeah.

104
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:11,400
Stacy, do you like art?

105
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:14,400
My wife fixes paintings and she also makes some of her owns.

106
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:19,400
Now, to me, paintings are the most |important interesting things in the world

107
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:21,400
next to your brain.

108
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:23,400
You feel better, don't you?

109
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:27,300
Mmh, migraines…he.

110
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:36,400
I said, I love you, Bella.”

111
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:39,400
I'll always remember that.

112
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:42,500
At least I got to say it.

113
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:21,300
Huh. Huh. Are you all right?! |Yeah, I think so.

114
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:29,000
I'm a doctor. Get me out of here!

115
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:29,500
Don't move.

116
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:57,400
Chris?

117
00:12:58,600 --> 00:12:59,500
Hmm? Do you know what's happened?

118
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:03,500
Yeah, I had a bad piece of fish before bed, Ha.

119
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:10,400
Who are you?

120
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:13,500
A doc? Are you operating on me?

121
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:20,400
Who are you? Why can't I see you?

122
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:37,600
Ginger. Ginger, you see me?

123
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:40,400
She does. Dogs are different.

124
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:44,600
Can you see me now? Is that you, doc?

125
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:48,600
Why are you so blurred? |I'll get clearer when you want me to, Chris.

126
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:52,300
Are you confused about |how you got home so fast?

127
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:54,600
Dreams don't deal in time, doc. |Time doesn't count.

128
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:06,600
You've died, Chris.

129
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:11,600
You have to be a dream, doc, |if I were dead, would I need you to tell me?

130
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:14,600
I guess you do. Everyone is different.

131
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:21,600
I wish everybody would go home. I know.

132
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:24,600
How can I see everyone, doc? Everybody

133
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:26,400
but…I know you don't wanna see me.

134
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:27,600
You don't wanna be dead.

135
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:31,600
The kids were so young when they died.

136
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:34,600
I want you to remember is your kids.

137
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:38,600
When they were still alive.

138
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:54,600
When she goes to the hospital, I'm going too.

139
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:07,600
Marie, Katie's not

140
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:12,700
Katie's not going there to get better.

141
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:16,500
Sugar?

142
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:20,700
They're gonna give her a shot.| And it's not gonna hurt

143
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:22,700
and she's gonna fall asleep.| You're going to kill my dog?

144
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:26,700
I'm going to help her die, yes.

145
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:32,700
Honey, she hurts very…very

146
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:39,400
badly and nothing can help her.

147
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:43,700
So, I'm gonna stop that, because I love her.| You're going to kill my dog.

148
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:48,700
You get angry. Death does that.

149
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:53,500
What'll happen to her?

150
00:15:58,700 --> 00:16:00,500
Uhm…she'll go where we all go.

151
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:03,500
And how can that be bad?

152
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:13,700
Come on, dad.

153
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:16,700
Oh, my leg!

154
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:18,700
Oh, oh, aah, stucker! Aah. Oh.

155
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:25,600
Thanks for not listening to Mom.

156
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:31,700
About what? Well, I don't know, just coming out here.

157
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:35,700
And this whole day. |You know, she didn't want us doing this, because of,

158
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:37,700
because of, I don't know, grades and stuff.

159
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:41,800
Your mother and I did talk.

160
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:46,800
And, uh, you know, we always listen to each other.

161
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:52,600
So, I mean, what'd you talk about?

162
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:56,800
About taking you out of Head-Royce.

163
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:02,600
The school is wrong for you.

164
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:07,800
While this is a time and

165
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:09,800
Where are we now?

166
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:14,800
Maybe you don't want to stay, Chris. This is your funeral.

167
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:20,800
What am I on? You're real, real fuzzy?

168
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:33,800
At least you're willing to see yourself.| You're losing your fear.

169
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:37,800
Fear? That you disappeared.

170
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:42,800
You didn't. You only died.

171
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:50,800
A woman...who lost her only children just four short years ago.

172
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:55,800
Every day in the Lord's Prayer. Celia, oh,

173
00:17:56,900 --> 00:17:57,800
oh…come on.

174
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:03,800
DE REPENTE UM DIA, SABEMOS Q SE SENTE

175
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:09,800
UM MOMENTO EM QUE LA FE, LA ESPERANCA

176
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:13,800
NOS POE UMA UNICA PROVA

177
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:08,900
This one is a present…for me.

178
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:14,900
It's our double D-anniversary. |It's kind of a special day.

179
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:18,900
It's her version of our place.

180
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:21,900
Your place? Where we first met.

181
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:26,900
Where we're going to retire, I guess.

182
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,900
Live out our lives. Be old farts together.

183
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,900
Right there. That's our dream house.

184
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:39,900
That one is me, I guess.

185
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:43,900
The blurry one is Annie.

186
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,900
Looks a little familiar, doc.

187
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,900
The funeral is over, doc. Why is this going on past the funeral?

188
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,000
Dear Diary,

189
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,900
I'm writing in your bullshit pages because my shrink is crazier than I am.

190
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
He thinks you're therapy.

191
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:18,000
He figures if two babies can hammer me| into a psycho ward, what'll I do with this?

192
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:20,800
He's so stupid.

193
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,700
He's so stupid he thinks he pulled me through the breakdown

194
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:29,000
when it was only Christy. Always. Only Chris.

195
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:33,000
Oh, Jesus…I was looking through his postcards.

196
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:35,000
Paintings were his obsession.

197
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,000
He used arts to love me, to help me.

198
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
To keep us always together.

199
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,000
Annie? I'm here, babe.

200
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,000
I still exist.

201
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,800
You're thinking of me. Keep thinking of me.

202
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,000
Come on, with me.

203
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,000
You were always with me.

204
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:07,000
You know, the people who finished each other's sentences. Remember us?

205
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:13,000
I still exist.

206
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:16,000
I still exist!

207
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:22,000
I still exist.

208
00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:25,000
Just write it down.

209
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:29,000
Write it down.

210
00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:35,000
This is Chris.

211
00:21:39,100 --> 00:21:40,900
This…is…Chris.

212
00:21:47,900 --> 00:21:48,900
I…

213
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:52,900
still…

214
00:21:56,900 --> 00:21:57,900
exist. Oh, yeah.

215
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:09,900
Read it.

216
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:12,100
Read it!

217
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:49,900
Christ, when does it end?

218
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:55,100
There's no rules, Chris.| It ends when you want to.

219
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:59,100
Where were you? Someplace else.

220
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:03,100
Mmh. What, you think I'm a figment of your imagination?

221
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:06,100
It's real. She's real. You're real. It's all real.

222
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:09,100
That's the point if there's a point.

223
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:13,100
Reality, it's over when you stop wanting to hurt her.

224
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:31,200
Forever…

225
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:44,200
Don't worry, baby…

226
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:51,000
I'm not leaving you alone. I'm not going anywhere. Aaah! Aaaah!

227
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:14,200
Goodbye, babe.

228
00:25:42,300 --> 00:25:43,300
Mh, mh. Oh, Katie, it's you! Ha-ha.

229
00:25:45,300 --> 00:25:46,300
You're young again. Oh.

230
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:52,100
Come here, Katie!

231
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:54,100
Katie! Katie!

232
00:25:55,300 --> 00:25:56,300
Katie?

233
00:25:59,300 --> 00:26:00,300
Hey, come on, hey!

234
00:26:03,300 --> 00:26:06,300
Boy, I screwed up. I'm in dog heaven.

235
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:20,300
A place where we all go can't be bad, can it, girl?

236
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:53,400
Maybe I'm not in your heaven after all girl! Maybe you're in mine!

237
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:03,400
Annie!!!

238
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:42,200
Chris? What the hell you're doing? That's not how you use a stethoscope!

239
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:46,200
Albert Lewis? Last time you saw me

240
00:27:46,300 --> 00:27:49,400
I was 63, stretched out on a cardiac ward!

241
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:54,400
I bet you thought I was old and decrepit, huh? |Talking about “Ah, can't go on,

242
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:56,400
can't go on!”

243
00:27:57,500 --> 00:28:00,200
Who wants to be 63 throughout eternity?

244
00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:03,200
Look at you on the water there! Well hello, somebody!

245
00:28:03,300 --> 00:28:07,400
Come on…walk along, feel the beat!

246
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:10,300
Dancing on water! He. Smooth as ever.

247
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:13,400
And that was you…

248
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:15,400
just now, when I,

249
00:28:17,300 --> 00:28:18,300
when I died.

250
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:22,500
I thought you recognized me, because you kept calling me, “Doc”.

251
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:26,500
Me being your favorite doc of all time. Could you lend me hand?

252
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:30,500
I'm kind of up to my ass in problems again, chief.

253
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:33,500
Oh, Chris…Ah, ah.

254
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:36,500
Come here.

255
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:39,500
You are still kinda ugly.

256
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:45,500
You taught me a lot, chief. Nice place you got here.

257
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:48,500
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, nice place you got here.

258
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:52,500
Me? Sure, you're making all of this.

259
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:54,500
See, we're all pretty insecure at first,

260
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:57,500
so we se ourselves somewhere safe and comforting.

261
00:28:57,600 --> 00:29:00,500
We all paint our surroundings, Chris, but you're the first guy

262
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:04,500
who knows to use real paint! There's so much here she didn't paint.

263
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:08,500
Like that bird.

264
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:13,500
Annie gave you a start, sort of like holding onto handrails.

265
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:16,300
Now you're creating an entire world here.

266
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:19,500
From your imagination, from paintings you love, anything you want.

267
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:23,500
Why doesn't it move? It will move when you want it to.

268
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:34,500
Oh-hoh! You go, boy! Can I make it dive?

269
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:37,500
You're the painter now! It's your world.

270
00:29:43,100 --> 00:29:44,400
Heeeeeaaa-haaa! Whoo. Look at it go!

271
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:48,500
How about maybe turquoise wings? Turquoise!

272
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:51,500
And a little mauve, all right! Wow!

273
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:10,600
Huh. I didn't do that. No, I did.

274
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:14,600
See, when we're together it's like dual controls.

275
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:16,600
Can I make elephants fly?

276
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:19,600
Hey, didn't Annie paint a house somewhere?

277
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:27,600
Yeah, it's our dream house.

278
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:31,600
Just a stroll across the water.

279
00:30:34,300 --> 00:30:35,400
Let's take the shortcut.

280
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:42,600
Nice shortcut. It's easy, Chris, look at me.

281
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:46,600
I'm gonna drown. You can't, you're already dead.

282
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:52,600
Oh. Am I…am I really here? What do you mean by “you” anyway?

283
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:55,600
Are you your arm or your leg?

284
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:57,600
Partly. Really?

285
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:01,400
If you lost all your limbs, would that still be you?

286
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:03,600
That's still be me. So, what is then “me”?

287
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:06,600
My brain, I suppose. Your brain?

288
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:11,600
Your brain is a body part. Like your fingernail or your heart.

289
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:13,400
Why would that be the part that's “you”?

290
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:15,600
Because

291
00:31:16,700 --> 00:31:19,600
“I” am sort of a voice in my head.| The part of me that thinks, that feels.

292
00:31:20,700 --> 00:31:22,600
That is aware that I exist at all.

293
00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:31,600
So, if you're aware you exist…then you do.

294
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:34,500
That's why you're still here.

295
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:51,700
No windows. What aren't you ready to see, I wonder?

296
00:31:56,700 --> 00:31:59,700
Drink it. Just thinks it's coffee and it will be.

297
00:32:00,700 --> 00:32:03,700
Okay. It's coffee.

298
00:32:06,700 --> 00:32:07,700
Paint! Acrylic.

299
00:32:10,700 --> 00:32:12,700
Why is it so hard? What?

300
00:32:13,700 --> 00:32:16,700
Your brain is meat. It rots and disappears.

301
00:32:17,700 --> 00:32:19,700
You really think that's all there was to you?

302
00:32:22,700 --> 00:32:24,700
Like, you're in your house right now.

303
00:32:25,700 --> 00:32:29,500
You're IN your house, it doesn't mean you ARE your house.

304
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:31,700
House falls down, you get out and walk away.

305
00:32:33,700 --> 00:32:37,500
But it looks like I rebuilt, huh?| You see your body because you like seeing one.

306
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:39,700
We're seeing what we choose to see.

307
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:43,500
Let me show you something.

308
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:20,700
Ha! It's real, where is all the paint? You don't need it anymore.

309
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:23,600
This is your world now.

310
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:29,800
Thought is real. Physical is the illusion.

311
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:32,800
Ironic, huh?

312
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:39,800
Where's God in all of this? He's up there.

313
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:43,800
Somewhere… shouting down that he loves us.

314
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:46,800
Wondering why we can't hear him. You think?

315
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:50,800
Yeah. Drink your coffee.

316
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:56,800
Needs milk. Don't push your luck.

317
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:11,800
What do you think, Christy?

318
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:16,800
Right here.

319
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:20,800
Like this?

320
00:34:22,700 --> 00:34:23,600
You think?

321
00:34:39,900 --> 00:34:41,800
They say we live in our minds anyway.

322
00:34:44,900 --> 00:34:46,800
Having you with me, like this,

323
00:34:47,900 --> 00:34:48,800
keeps me happy.

324
00:34:51,900 --> 00:34:53,800
Why do I believe you can hear me?

325
00:34:55,900 --> 00:34:57,800
Why do I think you can see this?

326
00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:06,900
What's that purple tree? I never saw that.

327
00:35:08,900 --> 00:35:11,900
Well, let's take a look.| Think you can get there in eight seconds?

328
00:35:12,900 --> 00:35:14,900
Fffw, eight seconds? Over there?

329
00:35:15,900 --> 00:35:17,900
Yeah, I just need a little incentive.

330
00:35:38,900 --> 00:35:41,900
Yeah, I can fly. Oh, no, no, no!

331
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,700
Why not? I can do what I want, right?

332
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:46,900
Well, I think you'd be more comfortable keeping it real.

333
00:35:47,900 --> 00:35:50,900
Okay. Think of running real fast, like the roadrunner. Okay. Okay? Yeah.

334
00:35:58,900 --> 00:35:59,900
I can handle this. Adios, muchacho. Ha-ha-ha-ha-ah.

335
00:36:07,900 --> 00:36:09,700
Oh, wait! Chris!

336
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:12,900
Annie!!!

337
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,900
I bet you're thinking “Oh, shit” now!

338
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:39,900
Yeah! Go, boy!

339
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,000
Go, Chris go! Ah. Ha-ha-ha. Ah.

340
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,000
Albert! Albert!

341
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
It's completely new.

342
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,000
The canvas was blank when I was alive.

343
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,000
How can I see this drawing after I'm dead?

344
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,000
Ha, for an expert you look pretty surprised.

345
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:44,000
You and Annie, a long courtship? No actually.

346
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,000
From the very first moment it was like-Soul mates.

347
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
It's extremely rare, but it exists.

348
00:37:52,100 --> 00:37:55,000
Sort of like two twin souls. Tuned in to each other.

349
00:37:57,100 --> 00:37:58,900
Apparently even in death.

350
00:38:02,100 --> 00:38:05,000
You're reaching each other through her painting. It's|-It's nothing I've ever seen, Chris.

351
00:38:09,100 --> 00:38:10,000
You can't see it, can you?

352
00:38:14,100 --> 00:38:15,000
And you never will.

353
00:38:57,100 --> 00:38:58,100
I love you. Aaah.

354
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,100
Whose footprints are these?

355
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:49,100
Don't ask me, you put 'em here.

356
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:04,000
Annie.

357
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:06,200
Annie! Chris!

358
00:40:06,300 --> 00:40:07,200
Annie!

359
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:19,200
Fantasy is not what you need right now, Chris. No, you're right,

360
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:22,200
I need Annie.

361
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:28,200
That'll change in time, Chris. Oh, come on, Einstein!

362
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:33,200
Time is not on my watch any more! Time…does not exist here!

363
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:37,200
And wherever it went, it won't make me need Annie any less.

364
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:43,200
You'll feel differently, Chris, and so will she! Man…

365
00:40:46,100 --> 00:40:47,000
you don't know us.

366
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:50,200
Wish I did.

367
00:40:58,100 --> 00:40:59,000
Marie.

368
00:41:00,100 --> 00:41:01,000
Marie!

369
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:08,200
Hey, look, it's Tigger!

370
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:13,200
It's my daughter's! Katie tore it up once and…

371
00:41:18,300 --> 00:41:19,200
she's here, right.

372
00:41:21,100 --> 00:41:22,100
Where's she?

373
00:41:25,300 --> 00:41:28,200
Chris, “here” is big enough for everybody to have their own private universe.

374
00:41:31,300 --> 00:41:34,200
That's not why you haven't seen you kids yet, is it?

375
00:41:37,100 --> 00:41:38,200
What does that mean, Buddha!

376
00:41:40,300 --> 00:41:42,200
I wanna see my children, Albert!

377
00:41:45,300 --> 00:41:46,300
When you do, you will.

378
00:42:04,300 --> 00:42:05,300
Does that hurt?

379
00:42:08,100 --> 00:42:09,100
Mm-mm. That?

380
00:42:10,300 --> 00:42:11,300
Mm-mm. How about that?

381
00:42:12,300 --> 00:42:14,300
I'm gonna keep doing this till you tickle.

382
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:24,300
You've got a fever. It's going down, though.| Don't you have to go somewhere?

383
00:42:27,300 --> 00:42:28,300
You wanna play chess?

384
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:34,100
I could teach you.

385
00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:37,100
Would you teach me that?

386
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:08,200
Excuse me.

387
00:43:12,200 --> 00:43:14,300
Albert has to work. He asked me to meet with you.

388
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:17,300
Would that be all right?

389
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:20,200
Leona…

390
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:24,200
That's a beautiful name. He said you've been isolated.

391
00:43:25,400 --> 00:43:28,400
Do you wanna see others? Perhaps a city?

392
00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:31,400
I would, but travel makes me nauseous.

393
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:39,400
Close your eyes.

394
00:43:42,200 --> 00:43:43,400
I didn't mean forever.

395
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:57,400
What do you think?

396
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:02,400
I think I'm a little under-dressed. You look fine.

397
00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:06,400
Until now you've been painting your world. This is mine.

398
00:44:07,400 --> 00:44:09,400
In our city across the river we have to have a common vision.

399
00:44:27,300 --> 00:44:28,400
So, there's work

400
00:44:30,500 --> 00:44:33,400
I like that. Albert, for example,

401
00:44:33,500 --> 00:44:37,200
he's sort of a missionary. Saving lost souls.

402
00:44:37,500 --> 00:44:39,400
Like me. Hardly.

403
00:44:40,500 --> 00:44:42,400
They are the ones who can't get here.

404
00:44:44,500 --> 00:44:46,400
You mean, from hell? In a way.

405
00:44:46,500 --> 00:44:48,400
It's probably not what you think.

406
00:44:49,500 --> 00:44:51,400
My work on the other hand, is with animals.

407
00:44:54,500 --> 00:44:56,300
Katie is an old friend.

408
00:44:58,100 --> 00:44:59,300
Dearest Christy.

409
00:45:00,500 --> 00:45:03,200
I don't know how this day unravelled.

410
00:45:03,300 --> 00:45:06,400
I was proud of how I held together through this annd this afternoon.

411
00:45:08,500 --> 00:45:10,500
But coming home, I began to lose it.

412
00:45:13,500 --> 00:45:17,500
If I had walked out that night for our double D,|you would have never been in the tunnel doing me a favor.

413
00:45:19,500 --> 00:45:21,500
A whole family lost in car crashes.

414
00:45:23,500 --> 00:45:25,300
Enough to make a person buy a bike.

415
00:45:30,500 --> 00:45:34,500
Where are they going? They're going to help others be reborn on earth.

416
00:45:35,500 --> 00:45:37,300
Really? Reincarnation.

417
00:45:45,500 --> 00:45:47,300
Albert says to cheer you up.

418
00:45:48,500 --> 00:45:51,500
You have difficulty…to losing my wife, yeah.

419
00:45:54,500 --> 00:45:57,500
And your children? They died years ago.

420
00:45:58,500 --> 00:46:00,500
That's why I'm worried about my wife.

421
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:05,500
They died in a terrible collision.

422
00:46:06,500 --> 00:46:08,500
The nanny was driving. It wasn't her fault.

423
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:11,300
And your wife?

424
00:46:12,600 --> 00:46:14,500
My daughter had asked her to drive.

425
00:46:32,600 --> 00:46:33,500
It was a trucker's fault.

426
00:46:35,400 --> 00:46:38,400
But my wife believed that if she'd been driving the kids,

427
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:40,500
her protective instinct would have…

428
00:46:54,600 --> 00:46:55,600
Are you okay?

429
00:47:03,400 --> 00:47:04,400
Come on, Katie!

430
00:47:19,300 --> 00:47:20,400
Where were you just now?

431
00:47:21,600 --> 00:47:23,600
Your mind's been wandering all afternoon.

432
00:47:25,600 --> 00:47:26,600
Thinking of someone.

433
00:47:29,600 --> 00:47:34,600
Your wife must have loved her children very much. Very much.

434
00:47:35,600 --> 00:47:37,600
But you don't have to break in half to love somebody.

435
00:47:42,600 --> 00:47:44,400
Tell me a memory of your own.

436
00:47:46,600 --> 00:47:48,400
Say, with your daughter.

437
00:48:07,700 --> 00:48:09,600
Hey, that's somebody else's art.

438
00:48:10,700 --> 00:48:13,600
What's the difference, you weren't looking anyway.

439
00:48:19,700 --> 00:48:20,600
Your move.

440
00:48:23,500 --> 00:48:24,600
Is this where we go when we die?

441
00:48:31,700 --> 00:48:33,700
It's a dream, baby. It's a beautiful one,

442
00:48:35,700 --> 00:48:37,700
but you know, dreams-I know, are not real.

443
00:48:39,500 --> 00:48:40,500
Yeah.

444
00:48:44,500 --> 00:48:46,400
It's after midnight. I haven't won yet.

445
00:48:46,500 --> 00:48:49,700
It's your first time. No, I like that I haven't won yet.

446
00:48:49,800 --> 00:48:50,700
Means that you're not cheating.

447
00:48:52,700 --> 00:48:56,700
And when I win, I really win. I just wanna play till I do.

448
00:48:58,700 --> 00:49:01,700
Unless you wanna stop. No. Let's play till you win.

449
00:49:04,700 --> 00:49:06,700
She died three months later.

450
00:49:08,700 --> 00:49:09,700
We played every night.

451
00:49:13,700 --> 00:49:14,700
It meant the world to me.

452
00:49:17,700 --> 00:49:18,700
But she never won.

453
00:49:46,800 --> 00:49:48,700
I didn't look like this in the body, you know.

454
00:49:53,800 --> 00:49:56,500
We flew to Singapore once.

455
00:49:56,800 --> 00:49:59,700
And my Daddy smiled at the flight attendant who…

456
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:05,800
looked like this and wore a name tag Leona.

457
00:50:09,800 --> 00:50:11,800
He said Asian women are so…

458
00:50:14,500 --> 00:50:16,800
lovely and… graceful and…

459
00:50:18,800 --> 00:50:20,800
intelligent. He didn't mean only

460
00:50:20,900 --> 00:50:23,800
-I know. It was just something he said.

461
00:50:23,900 --> 00:50:28,800
And what I thought was, when I grow up I wanna be that.

462
00:50:32,600 --> 00:50:33,800
You still play chess?

463
00:50:43,800 --> 00:50:45,800
I think I waited for my partner.
