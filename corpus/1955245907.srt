That's because I stay

Five years ago,

21

the ratings started
to take a dip.

22
00:01:20,781 --> 00:01:22,481

is I fired my best friend

00:01:24,318 --> 00:01:27,453

through the roof, you know?

your last name be punctuation

00:15:04,571 --> 00:15:07,105
for a lot of the weapon systems
that keep America safe.

337
00:15:07,107 --> 00:15:10,441
So in a way, she's like
a real-life Tony Stark.

338
00:15:10,443 --> 00:15:13,177
Which, I guess, you know,
makes me Hawkeye.

339
00:15:15,148 --> 00:15:17,081
He's... he's tough, right?

340
00:15:17,083 --> 00:15:19,050
Why's everybody shrugging?

341
00:15:19,052 --> 00:15:21,219
(WHISPERING) I told you
about this a couple times.

342
00:15:21,221 --> 00:15:22,487
I should've reminded you.

343
00:15:22,489 --> 00:15:25,189
These guys are with
the, uh, "Chris!" show.

344
00:15:25,191 --> 00:15:27,458
And Lucy's up getting
her own TV show.

345
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:29,494
- It's kind of a big deal.
- Yeah, okay.

346
00:15:29,496 --> 00:15:31,095
Everyone in the neighborhood's
all freaking out.

347
00:15:31,097 --> 00:15:33,498
That's great.
Um, I've got a late meeting,

348
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:35,066
so I'm gonna go.

349
00:15:35,068 --> 00:15:37,368
- Okay, yeah.
- Okay, uh, you need to shave.

350
00:15:37,370 --> 00:15:38,670
- Oh, right. Oh, yeah, sorry.
- (PHONE VIBRATING)

351
00:15:38,672 --> 00:15:41,239
Yeah, Brian, hi.

352
00:15:41,241 --> 00:15:43,141
- Yeah, sorry, family shit.
- All right.

353
00:15:43,143 --> 00:15:45,510
There goes your mom.

354
00:15:45,512 --> 00:15:47,478
That's Go-Go Mary.

355
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:49,314
Always on the go.

356
00:15:51,017 --> 00:15:52,717
You'll see a high 78
in the Valley.

357
00:15:52,719 --> 00:15:54,953
74 in the low-laying regions

358
00:15:54,955 --> 00:15:57,355
as things heat up when we head
into the Fourth of July...

359
00:15:57,357 --> 00:15:58,423
- (STOMACH GROWLS)
- weekend.

360
00:15:58,425 --> 00:16:00,024
Sorry about that, folks.
Oh, God.

361
00:16:00,026 --> 00:16:01,659
Oh, God, it's coming.
Cut it! Cut it!

362
00:16:01,661 --> 00:16:04,295
Oh, my God, I'm shitting.
I'm shitting my pants!

363
00:16:04,297 --> 00:16:07,131
<i>Oh, my God,
I'm shitting my pants!</i>

364
00:16:07,133 --> 00:16:11,035
I'm shitting myself!
I'm shitting myself!

365
00:16:11,037 --> 00:16:13,371
Oh! Oh!

366
00:16:13,373 --> 00:16:17,575
Okay, first thoughts
on jokes I should say.

367
00:16:17,577 --> 00:16:19,077
Hey, that's a lot of
number two.

368
00:16:19,079 --> 00:16:20,745
Hey, buddy, you're supposed
to be looking out

369
00:16:20,747 --> 00:16:24,048
- for number one.
- Oh, that's good.

370
00:16:24,050 --> 00:16:27,151
That's really good.
My fans will love that.

371
00:16:27,153 --> 00:16:30,021
Uh, he should've
forecast mudslides.

372
00:16:30,023 --> 00:16:32,423
- (LAUGHTER)
- Oh!

373
00:16:32,425 --> 00:16:34,125
"Mudslides."

374
00:16:34,127 --> 00:16:38,463
Most people don't know this,
but comedians like myself,

375
00:16:38,465 --> 00:16:40,665
have a team of writers.

376
00:16:40,667 --> 00:16:42,533
And when I started my show,

377
00:16:42,535 --> 00:16:46,004
I received a bunch of emails
from these three kids

378
00:16:46,006 --> 00:16:48,790
<i>that were huge fans of mine.</i>

379
00:16:48,791 --> 00:16:51,575
<i>And I met up with them
and they were just so funny</i>

380
00:16:51,578 --> 00:16:53,711
<i>and so nice.</i>

381
00:16:53,713 --> 00:16:55,480
<i>Three little gentlemen.</i>

382
00:16:55,482 --> 00:16:58,483
- She's awesome.
- Super funny, super cool.

383
00:16:58,485 --> 00:17:02,453
It's really cool working
with someone like that.

384
00:17:02,455 --> 00:17:04,222
We try to hug her
as much as we can.

385
00:17:04,224 --> 00:17:06,124
MAN: <i>What do you think of
your chances of winning?</i>

386
00:17:06,126 --> 00:17:09,360
Yeah, I think I have
a really good chance to win.

387
00:17:09,362 --> 00:17:12,463
Um, I'm the only woman
doing comedy,

388
00:17:12,465 --> 00:17:14,599
so I'm kind of
representing them.

389
00:17:14,601 --> 00:17:16,667
And so I'll for sure get

390
00:17:16,669 --> 00:17:20,671
all the votes
from the women.

391
00:17:20,673 --> 00:17:24,308
And then I'll get
all the votes from the men.

392
00:17:24,310 --> 00:17:26,778
So...

393
00:17:28,214 --> 00:17:30,481
that's like all the votes.

394

399
00:17:46,633 --> 00:17:49,067
I work really hard.

400
00:17:49,069 --> 00:17:51,636
You know, like,
I don't even sleep sometimes.

401
00:17:51,638 --> 00:17:53,304
Trying to make
all these parodies,

402
00:17:53,306 --> 00:17:55,106
so much time,
so much effort.

403
00:17:55,108 --> 00:17:57,241
And for what,
one video a month?

404
00:17:57,243 --> 00:17:59,310
(SCOFFS) I mean,
talk about being a slave.

405
00:17:59,312 --> 00:18:02,246
But what I did find out
is I could do more videos

406
00:18:02,248 --> 00:18:05,383
if I just keep the cost
and the quality down.

407
00:18:05,385 --> 00:18:08,252
So I do daily videos,
or as I call them, daily vlogs.

408
00:18:08,254 --> 00:18:10,655
Basically, it's anything
I wanna do that day.

409
00:18:10,657 --> 00:18:12,457
You know, like sometimes
I whip out my phone

410
00:18:12,459 --> 00:18:14,492
when me and my squad
are like rolling through a jam

411
00:18:14,494 --> 00:18:16,127
trying to blow some cake.

412
00:18:16,129 --> 00:18:17,628
Sometimes me and my boys

413
00:18:17,630 --> 00:18:20,298
will just, like,
do some dope-ass challenge.

414
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:23,534
Sometimes I get real, you know,
and it gets deep A-F

415
00:18:23,536 --> 00:18:25,570
when I talk about things
that are really important to me.

416
00:18:25,572 --> 00:18:26,871
You know, like rape.

417
00:18:26,873 --> 00:18:28,473
Hey, what's up, employees?

418
00:18:28,475 --> 00:18:30,274
Okay, I am so excited
right now

419
00:18:30,276 --> 00:18:31,542
because I'm meeting up
with Hanky Pank.

420
00:18:31,544 --> 00:18:33,711
Oh, there he is.

421
00:18:33,713 --> 00:18:35,713
- <i>Hanky Pank.</i>
- Hey.

422
00:18:35,715 --> 00:18:37,782
We got chosen to be
one of the finalists

423
00:18:37,784 --> 00:18:39,851
in the "Chris!" show
Web Star of the Year Award!

424
00:18:39,853 --> 00:18:42,753
- Yes!
- Oh! Oh! Okay.

425
00:18:42,755 --> 00:18:44,455
When we see you at WebCon,
we're coming.

426
00:18:44,457 --> 00:18:46,290
- We're on our way tomorrow.
- We leave tomorrow.

427
00:18:46,292 --> 00:18:48,493
We will give you all hugs
and kisses on the lips.

428
00:18:48,495 --> 00:18:50,194
We'll do anything
you guys want.

429
00:18:50,196 --> 00:18:51,796
Please, please, please,
we never ask you for anything.

430
00:18:51,798 --> 00:18:53,598
- Okay, except for like merch.
- And ringtones.

431
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:55,199
Obviously, but right now,

432
00:18:55,201 --> 00:18:56,718
this is so much bigger
than any of that.

433
00:18:56,719 --> 00:18:58,236
If you guys vote,
we can have our own show.

434
00:18:58,238 --> 00:19:00,238
And then you can tell your friends,
like, "Oh, my favorite show?"

435
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:01,873
My favorite show is
'The Tomas Show.'"

436
00:19:01,875 --> 00:19:03,174
Like featuring Hank.

437
00:19:03,176 --> 00:19:04,909
Hank is...

438
00:19:04,911 --> 00:19:07,645
Well, he's kinda like
my brother, you know?

439
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:11,182
We hang out all the time.
We, uh, make videos together.

440
00:19:11,184 --> 00:19:14,619
<i>If I need something from the store, like
last minute, he's down to go get it.</i>

441
00:19:14,621 --> 00:19:17,288
<i>He takes me everywhere.
He's basically my Uber.</i>

442
00:19:17,290 --> 00:19:18,523
<i>And he's my best friend.</i>

443
00:19:18,525 --> 00:19:20,358
Right now, he's trying to do
his own thing.

444
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:21,893
You know,
start his own channel.

445
00:19:21,895 --> 00:19:23,494
And, uh,
it's going pretty...

446
00:19:23,496 --> 00:19:25,396
Hey, say hi to
the Hanky Panks.

447
00:19:25,398 --> 00:19:28,199
- Hey, Hanky Panks!
- See, I told you.

448
00:19:31,604 --> 00:19:34,605
Between you and me,
there's no Hanky Panks.

449
00:19:34,607 --> 00:19:37,475
They're just employees trying to see a
glimpse of the boss in the background,

450
00:19:37,477 --> 00:19:39,443
but I humor him.

451
00:19:39,445 --> 00:19:41,712
'Cause, you know,
he's sweet.

452
00:19:41,714 --> 00:19:44,715
<i>And I think it gives him
a sense of worth.</i>

453
00:19:44,717 --> 00:19:47,285
Which is good,
he needs that.

454
00:19:54,294 --> 00:19:57,728
Thank you.
I feel like a princess.

455
00:19:57,730 --> 00:20:00,731
No problem,
Your Majesty.

Uh...

459
00:20:05,838 --> 00:20:08,306
Yeah, our parents
have no idea where we are.

460
00:20:08,308 --> 00:20:09,874
Parents think
I'm staying with Doug.

461
00:20:09,876 --> 00:20:11,442
And my parents think
I'm staying with Kevin.

462
00:20:11,444 --> 00:20:12,944
Kevin doesn't
have any parents.

463
00:20:12,946 --> 00:20:15,479
- Shut up.
- What?

464
00:20:15,481 --> 00:20:16,781
It's true you don't have
any parents.

465
00:20:16,783 --> 00:20:18,816
You don't have any parents.

466

DALE: <i>You know,
driving can be pretty boring.</i>

467
00:20:22,956 --> 00:20:24,889

468
00:20:24,891 --> 00:20:27,725
<i>"Oh, God, I wish
something fun would happen."</i>

469

<i>I pop Lucy in my lap,

Hi. Oh, sweetheart.

No, no, I'm joking.
Come on, bad joke.

00:21:12,839 --> 00:21:14,672
- (WHISPERS) Jesus.
- Just put your tush

00:21:14,674 --> 00:21:17,575
- in the chair, okay?
- Great. Thank you.

490
00:21:17,577 --> 00:21:20,511

Oh, is that the new
Channing Tatum movie?

No, it's better.
It's better.

493
00:21:25,418 --> 00:21:27,852
It's the probiotic yogurt

- Get off your phone!

670
00:29:52,057 --> 00:29:54,992
Let's get that Chocolate Rain
guy back on the phone.

671
00:29:54,994 --> 00:29:58,195
I don't care
what his rate is.

672
00:29:58,197 --> 00:29:59,963
You can go.

<i>So I'm here...</i>

00:30:02,201 --> 00:30:04,434
at the convention.

The con...
the big contest.

676

It's great being here.

677
00:30:10,042 --> 00:30:13,544
Um, I'm so glad
that they let me back in

678
00:30:13,546 --> 00:30:15,846
the competition.

679
00:30:15,848 --> 00:30:19,049
So I could compete
for a one-in-five chance

680
00:30:19,051 --> 00:30:21,919
to have my own TV show.

681
00:30:23,122 --> 00:30:26,190
MAN: <i>So if you won,
what would your show be about?</i>

682
00:30:28,227 --> 00:30:30,961
I... I would
just want a show

683
00:30:30,963 --> 00:30:33,997
that would be important
to people.

684
00:30:33,999 --> 00:30:35,532
Would... would matter.

685
00:30:35,534 --> 00:30:38,569
I-I would want a show
that has substance and...

686
00:30:39,939 --> 00:30:42,139
just make a difference
in people's lives.

687
00:30:42,141 --> 00:30:43,874
I feel like that
would be awesome.

688
00:30:43,876 --> 00:30:46,577

gonna probably call me.

be by my name and everything,

but I'm...

692
00:30:52,384 --> 00:30:55,052
I'm here to tell
everybody that

00:30:55,054 --> 00:30:56,987
they have to be okay

694
00:30:56,989 --> 00:30:59,857

I'm never doing that again.

the worst day of my life.

- I have this one, guys.

Oh, it looks like
they only gave us one bed.

- I'm calling management right now.

- Don't worry, Amber, we got this.
- What?

00:32:07,660 --> 00:32:10,060
No, guys, it's fine.

718
00:32:10,062 --> 00:32:12,129
We'll share.

719
00:32:15,301 --> 00:32:17,100
All right,
let's get this started.

720
00:32:17,102 --> 00:32:19,569
Thank you, each and every
one of you, for coming.

721
00:32:19,571 --> 00:32:20,938
And, actually,
with this turn out,

722
00:32:20,940 --> 00:32:22,706
I will be able to thank

723
00:32:22,708 --> 00:32:25,442
each and every one of you
privately, which is great.

724
00:32:25,444 --> 00:32:28,211
There's something called
the strategic inflexion point.

725
00:32:28,213 --> 00:32:30,981
That's when you sort of
show up out in society

726
00:32:30,983 --> 00:32:33,250
and you realize that everyone's
speaking another language.

727
00:32:33,252 --> 00:32:35,519
I didn't understand what the
hell anyone was talking about.

728
00:32:35,521 --> 00:32:37,587
It was literally
like I walk out,

729
00:32:37,589 --> 00:32:39,957
and I talk to a person
who's younger than 40,

sounded like to me.

But then I thought
when you reach that point

733
00:32:46,298 --> 00:32:47,698
and everyone's speaking
gibberish,

734
00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:51,068
you better find out
what they're talking about.

735
00:32:51,070 --> 00:32:52,669
Turned out they were talking
about the Internet.

Fellini.

742
00:33:10,089 --> 00:33:13,423
These aren't just names,
they're filmmakers.

743
00:33:13,425 --> 00:33:16,259

Mr. Blankets?

a cat nap.

Fantastic.

749
00:33:30,376 --> 00:33:32,442
No, seriously,
where's the cat?

750
00:33:32,444 --> 00:33:35,212
I waited 45 minutes to make
a Vine with Mr. Blankets.

751
00:33:35,214 --> 00:33:38,715
He's... Does anyone have
any questions about filmmaking?

Let's, uh, let's do that.

00:33:50,161 --> 00:33:52,161
Let's go ahead and open this up
to a... to a Q and A.

00:33:52,164 --> 00:33:54,731
Are there any questions at all?
Anything at all, fire away.

00:33:54,733 --> 00:33:57,167
Yes, ma'am.

<i>Would you rather have
all of your clothes</i>

760
00:34:00,706 --> 00:34:03,306

or ice cream?

00:34:03,308 --> 00:34:06,710
- Thank you.
- Ice cream, definitely.

762
00:34:06,712 --> 00:34:09,446
Hey, that's
a really good question.

763
00:34:09,448 --> 00:34:12,149
Let's just open it up to the panel,
let's just go right down the line.

764
00:34:12,151 --> 00:34:15,485
Texas Mike, ice cream
or nachos for clothes?

765
00:34:16,655 --> 00:34:18,655
I don't know,
they're both pretty messy.

766
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:22,726
I think ice cream
would just be way too cold.

767
00:34:24,363 --> 00:34:27,397
Ice cream.
I can take it.

You always say
what's on your mind.

770
00:34:33,772 --> 00:34:36,339
Well, I, for one,
am definitely wearing nachos,

771
00:34:36,341 --> 00:34:38,608
so I guess we got a tie.

772
00:34:38,610 --> 00:34:41,812
And a tiebreaker, Dennis.

Come on, you came all this way.

Don't you want to, uh,
talk to your fellow filmmakers?

What, so they can ask me what my
favorite jellybean flavor is?

You're all bullshit!
Wake up!

Well, you must be some kind of
sensation. What do you do?

00:35:55,354 --> 00:35:57,354
I take pictures of myself.

know about this?

to be famous.

and modeling since I was six.

one more commercial,

I'll have enough
for a nose job.

(CAMERA CLICKS)

807
00:36:26,318 --> 00:36:28,285
So shipping is when...

808
00:36:28,287 --> 00:36:31,421
You take two people who you think
are totally meant for each other...

809
00:36:31,423 --> 00:36:33,256
And you say
that you "ship" them.

810
00:36:33,258 --> 00:36:36,626
Which is basically like putting
them together as a couple.

811
00:36:36,628 --> 00:36:39,462
So Hank and Tomas

812
00:36:39,464 --> 00:36:41,298
become Hamas!

813
00:36:41,300 --> 00:36:43,867
And then we pretend
like they are married.

814
00:36:43,869 --> 00:36:46,903
And then they do stuff
that married people usually do.

815
00:36:46,905 --> 00:36:48,638
Like sex things.

816
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:51,441
Which is great because
they're straight in real life,

817
00:36:51,443 --> 00:36:53,910
so we have to fantasize.

with one of these bags?

1004
00:46:27,085 --> 00:46:30,820
and current host of "HURRY!
Buy this Jewelry NOW!,"

1005
00:46:30,822 --> 00:46:33,322
Karen Raye Quivers!

1006
00:46:33,324 --> 00:46:35,958
Oh, hey, Chris.

1007
00:46:35,960 --> 00:46:39,562
I'm so excited to be here...
for a limited time only.

1008
00:46:39,564 --> 00:46:43,299
Our second judge
is a real cutup.

1009
00:46:43,301 --> 00:46:45,401
He's always pulling pranks
around the office.

1010
00:46:45,403 --> 00:46:46,936
Meet Frank Riggits.

1011
00:46:46,938 --> 00:46:50,039
- (CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)
- Hello.

1012
00:46:50,041 --> 00:46:52,975
Our third judge
is a comic icon.

1013
00:46:52,977 --> 00:46:55,244
You know him
from that hilarious trilogy,

1014
00:46:55,246 --> 00:46:57,413
"Don't Tell Mom
I Got Turned Into a Donkey!"

1015
00:46:57,415 --> 00:46:58,981
It's Larry Trambone.

1016
00:46:58,983 --> 00:47:01,584
- <i>(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)</i>
- (LAUGHING)

1017
00:47:06,124 --> 00:47:07,390
We'll be right back.

1018
00:47:13,164 --> 00:47:15,598
Is that your cat
right there?

1019
00:47:15,600 --> 00:47:19,001
- Uh, yeah.
- Nice, nice.

1020
00:47:21,940 --> 00:47:26,008
- How much you want for it?
- Excuse me?

1021
00:47:27,145 --> 00:47:30,880
That cat.
I'll give you $500 for it.

1022
00:47:30,882 --> 00:47:33,015
It's my wife's cat,

1023
00:47:33,017 --> 00:47:36,853
so I can't really sell it.

1024
00:47:36,855 --> 00:47:38,955
Tell her you took it
to the vet

1025
00:47:38,957 --> 00:47:41,123
and there were
complications.

1026
00:47:41,125 --> 00:47:44,193
He's just here
for a flea bath.

1027
00:47:54,105 --> 00:47:57,506
"Honey, I took the cat
to the vet."

1028
00:47:57,508 --> 00:47:59,475
And can you believe it?

1029
00:47:59,477 --> 00:48:01,277
"He drowned
in his flea bath."

1030
00:48:01,279 --> 00:48:03,579
Jesus, man.

1031
00:48:05,016 --> 00:48:07,950
The gray Ford, 2,000 cash.

1032
00:48:07,952 --> 00:48:09,919
Final offer for that cat.

1033
00:48:13,091 --> 00:48:15,091
- Bethany's coming.
- Okay.

1034
00:48:15,093 --> 00:48:16,626
- Should I let her back?
- Yeah.

1035
00:48:16,628 --> 00:48:18,527
Chris, hey, it's me.

1036
00:48:18,529 --> 00:48:20,496
Yes, me-me, hi.

1037
00:48:20,498 --> 00:48:24,233
Hey, um, I wanted to tell you
a little story about myself

1038
00:48:24,235 --> 00:48:26,235
- if you don't mind.
- No.

1039
00:48:26,237 --> 00:48:30,373
You see, I used to get picked on
and bullied every single day.

1040
00:48:30,375 --> 00:48:31,574
And it was really hard.

1041
00:48:31,576 --> 00:48:34,043
I mean, I'd come home
with red eyes

1042
00:48:34,045 --> 00:48:36,379
and tear-covered cheeks.

1043
00:48:36,381 --> 00:48:38,180
And I got made fun of a lot
'cause we were poor

1044
00:48:38,182 --> 00:48:40,983
and I couldn't really afford
clothes like these, you know?

1045
00:48:40,985 --> 00:48:43,653
- I smelt like a friggin' thrift store.
- Oh.

1046
00:48:43,655 --> 00:48:46,522
But every day,

1047
00:48:46,524 --> 00:48:48,257
I would see my best friend

1048
00:48:48,259 --> 00:48:51,928
at 3:00 p.m. without fail.

1049
00:48:51,930 --> 00:48:54,497
And his name was Chris.

1050
00:48:54,499 --> 00:48:58,301
You helped me
through so much.

1051
00:48:58,303 --> 00:49:01,237
And I don't think I'd be here
if it wasn't for you.

1052
00:49:01,239 --> 00:49:05,174
And I just wanted to say
thank you and...

1053
00:49:05,176 --> 00:49:07,410
man, I love you.

1054
00:49:07,412 --> 00:49:11,080
I think that you...

1055
00:49:11,082 --> 00:49:14,617
are a very special
young man.

1056
00:49:14,619 --> 00:49:16,652
And I will always
be your friend.

1057
00:49:16,654 --> 00:49:18,621
- Really?
- Always.

1058
00:49:18,623 --> 00:49:21,524
Come here.

1059
00:49:21,526 --> 00:49:24,193
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

1060
00:49:31,469 --> 00:49:33,436
- Did you get it?
- Every freakin' word.

1061
00:49:33,438 --> 00:49:35,604
(GASPS) Oh, my God,
that angle, though.

1062
00:49:35,606 --> 00:49:38,207
(LAUGHS)
That's gonna get so many views.

1063
00:49:38,209 --> 00:49:39,275
Let's go.

1064
00:49:39,277 --> 00:49:41,344
(BASS THUMPING IN BACKGROUND)

1065
00:49:44,582 --> 00:49:46,449
Oh, miss, no-no, thanks.

1066
00:49:46,451 --> 00:49:49,385
Yeah, she's a baby. Yeah.

1067
00:49:49,387 --> 00:49:51,988
She's literally 14 months old.
I just don't think she needs it.

1068
00:49:51,990 --> 00:49:53,422
Thank you.

1069
00:49:53,424 --> 00:49:56,625
She's a little baby.

1070
00:49:56,627 --> 00:49:59,996
(SIGHS) Hey, has anyone seen Mr.
Blankets?

1071
00:49:59,998 --> 00:50:01,998
- He's a cat.
- DALE:<i> Oh, no, sir.</i>

1072
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:03,366
Been looking all over
for the guy.

1073
00:50:03,368 --> 00:50:05,301
Okay, well,
this guy's a real no-show.

1074
00:50:05,303 --> 00:50:08,170
I guess I can just put him at the
end and we'll see what happen...

1075
00:50:09,374 --> 00:50:11,240
Copy that.
Okay, everybody,

1076
00:50:11,242 --> 00:50:13,309
I have your main man
for the evening.

1077
00:50:13,311 --> 00:50:15,644
Please welcome
the one and only Chris.

1078
00:50:15,646 --> 00:50:17,446
Chris:
<i>Hey, ha ha ha!</i>

1079
00:50:17,448 --> 00:50:19,448
Wow!
All of you in one room.

1080
00:50:19,450 --> 00:50:22,051
This is amazing.
I'm so glad you guys made it.

1081
00:50:22,053 --> 00:50:25,187
- I am such a huge fan, sir.
- Me of you, me of you.

1082
00:50:25,189 --> 00:50:26,689
- May I?
- Oh, yeah.

1083
00:50:26,691 --> 00:50:28,457
Hello, hello.

1084
00:50:28,459 --> 00:50:31,560
(DEMONIC VOICE)
Hello.

1085
00:50:33,731 --> 00:50:35,765
(CHUCKLES)
Wow, it's a tough crowd.

1086
00:50:35,767 --> 00:50:38,401
- (VOCALIZES)
- Hi, Chris.

1087
00:50:38,403 --> 00:50:40,636
- Hey.
- I'm so excited to be working with you.

1088
00:50:40,638 --> 00:50:43,539
Well, I've always thought that
you've two have got a lot of talent.

1089
00:50:43,541 --> 00:50:47,343
- (LAUGHTER)
- Good one, Chris.

1090
00:50:50,181 --> 00:50:54,050
Now, listen, I know you guys are used to
the isolation of being in your basement

1091
00:50:54,052 --> 00:50:56,485
and looking into your video cameras
and everything, but here's the deal.

1092
00:50:56,487 --> 00:50:59,522
It's exactly like it is
at home right here.

1093
00:50:59,524 --> 00:51:01,590
Except that there's about
12 cameras, okay?

1094
00:51:01,592 --> 00:51:05,361
And about 8,000 people in the house, maybe
another ten or 20 million watching.

1095
00:51:05,363 --> 00:51:07,063
All right, so no need to be
nervous or anything.

1096
00:51:07,065 --> 00:51:08,564
But if you feel
like you gotta hurl,

1097
00:51:08,566 --> 00:51:10,666
just make sure you do it before
you get out on stage, okay?

1098
00:51:10,668 --> 00:51:12,535
All right, now, uh...

1099
00:51:12,536 --> 00:51:14,403
(HIGH-PITCHED) this little host has
to host his own little show now.

1100
00:51:14,405 --> 00:51:16,739
So if you'll excuse me,
I'll see you later.

1101
00:51:16,741 --> 00:51:18,707
(NORMAL VOICE) And listen,
good luck to you, okay?

1102
00:51:18,709 --> 00:51:20,509
- Bye.
- So long, Chris.

1103
00:51:20,511 --> 00:51:22,511
Okay, everybody,
this is how it's gonna go.

1104
00:51:22,513 --> 00:51:25,481
All right, you'll do a quick
introduction, they'll roll tape,

1105
00:51:25,483 --> 00:51:27,033
you'll do
your live performances.

1106
00:51:27,034 --> 00:51:28,584
<i>Keep it under two minutes,
please, guys.</i>

1107
00:51:28,586 --> 00:51:30,753
- What?!
- Live performance... no, no, no.

1108
00:51:30,755 --> 00:51:32,755
Nobody... nobody said there
was gonna be a live performance.

1109
00:51:32,757 --> 00:51:35,224
I didn't know anything
about a live performance,

1110
00:51:35,226 --> 00:51:36,725
so I don't think
we're doing it.

1111
00:51:36,727 --> 00:51:38,594
- Yeah, nobody told us about that.
- Yeah.

1112
00:51:38,596 --> 00:51:40,529
Uh, guys, I don't know
what to tell you.

1113
00:51:40,531 --> 00:51:42,865
It's a talent competition,
so it's why you're here.

1114
00:51:42,867 --> 00:51:44,700
Well, I guess we'll just have
to whip something up for ya.

1115
00:51:44,702 --> 00:51:46,569
Excellent.
Uh, speaking of which,

1116
00:51:46,571 --> 00:51:50,539
I have a very special celebrity
talent coach, Mr. Tay Zonday.

1117
00:51:52,376 --> 00:51:55,411
Hey, guys,
it's gonna be great.

1118
00:51:55,413 --> 00:51:59,748
Just believe in yourselves,
and, yeah...

1119
00:51:59,750 --> 00:52:03,119
I don't know
what else to tell you.

1120
00:52:03,121 --> 00:52:05,588
Great. Awesome.
Yeah, let's get the photo.

1121
00:52:07,758 --> 00:52:09,625
Gorgeous.

1122
00:52:09,627 --> 00:52:11,460
Okay, we parked out back?

1123
00:52:11,462 --> 00:52:14,430
- Yeah, right around the corner.
- And what was the point of that?

1124
00:52:14,432 --> 00:52:16,599
Five minutes, guys.

1125
00:52:16,601 --> 00:52:17,900
What do we do?
What do we do? What do we do?

1126
00:52:17,902 --> 00:52:20,369
Our top finalists
worked around the clock

1127
00:52:20,371 --> 00:52:24,406
with our special celebrity
talent coach Tay Zonday.

1128
00:52:24,408 --> 00:52:26,342
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

1129
00:52:26,344 --> 00:52:30,546
Here are some special moments
from that day.

1130
00:52:30,548 --> 00:52:32,281
(MUSIC PLAYING)

1131
00:52:32,283 --> 00:52:34,783
I was so impressed by the
talent in this competition.

1132
00:52:34,785 --> 00:52:38,320
Working with them all
so closely, I can safely say,

1133
00:52:38,322 --> 00:52:41,157
it's gonna be very hard to predict
how this thing shakes out.

1134
00:52:41,159 --> 00:52:44,827
I did everything I could to give
them all the tools they needed.

1135
00:52:44,829 --> 00:52:46,729
And anything they didn't
get from me in person,

1136
00:52:46,731 --> 00:52:50,166
they can get in my newly released
book called, "Buy My Book."

1137
00:52:50,168 --> 00:52:51,901
Available in stores right now.

1138
00:52:51,903 --> 00:52:55,337
Buy it.
Just don't ask me what's in it.

1139
00:52:55,339 --> 00:52:57,339
Thank you.

1140
00:52:57,341 --> 00:53:00,209
Some people read
Jonathan Livingston Seagull.

1141
00:53:00,211 --> 00:53:01,677
Others, the "Way of
the Peaceful Warrior."

1142
00:53:01,679 --> 00:53:04,380
- I just grab a minute with Tay Zonday.
- (LAUGHER)

1143
00:53:04,382 --> 00:53:06,282
He gave us a minute.

1144
00:53:06,284 --> 00:53:07,716
Thanks for watching
the "Chris!" show.

1145
00:53:07,718 --> 00:53:09,552
It's Chris.
We'll be right back.

1146
00:53:11,422 --> 00:53:13,522
Amber, you're on
in two minutes, okay?

1147
00:53:13,524 --> 00:53:15,524
- All right.
- Excuse me, guys, sorry.

1148
00:53:15,526 --> 00:53:17,826
Oh, no. Okay.

1149
00:53:17,828 --> 00:53:20,629
Writers, what do I do?

1150
00:53:20,631 --> 00:53:22,464
You could tell some jokes.

1151
00:53:22,466 --> 00:53:25,568
I know this one joke about
two guys that walk into church.

1152
00:53:25,570 --> 00:53:27,570
One knows about science,
and one knows about God,

1153
00:53:27,572 --> 00:53:29,605
but that ain't
no two minutes, man.

1154
00:53:29,607 --> 00:53:32,841
You're probably just going to have to
take it all off and show them the goods.

1155
00:53:32,843 --> 00:53:35,344
The goods! That's it!

1156
00:53:35,346 --> 00:53:37,646
<i>I'll do Mrs. Cloudbottom.</i>

1157
00:53:37,648 --> 00:53:40,482
But my costume's upstairs,
can one of you get it in time?

1158
00:53:40,484 --> 00:53:42,484
- I'm on it.
- But, Doug, you're not so fast.

1159
00:53:42,486 --> 00:53:45,487
Today, I'm gonna have to be.
Excuse me.

1160
00:53:45,489 --> 00:53:47,690
It's going to be okay, Amber.

1161
00:53:47,692 --> 00:53:50,392
I-I'm really sorry.
I'm terrible at time management.

1162
00:53:50,394 --> 00:53:52,361
- You're on right now, okay?
- Wait...

1163
00:53:52,363 --> 00:53:53,462
Come on, baby, come on.
Right now.

1164
00:53:53,464 --> 00:53:54,997
Just... just think of
Eddie Murphy.

1165
00:53:54,999 --> 00:53:57,600
Our first finalist
is a "comedian"

1166

So, Amber, if you get your own

what the heck
are you gonna do?

Well...

I just wanna
make people laugh.

1175
