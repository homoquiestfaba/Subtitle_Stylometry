1
00:00:01,996 --> 00:00:03,296
I'm choking back tears.

2
00:00:03,364 --> 00:00:05,498
This was a big fight
in the writers' room.

3
00:00:05,566 --> 00:00:07,834
It set like the danger level very high.

4
00:00:07,901 --> 00:00:09,235
Please kill her.

5
00:00:09,303 --> 00:00:11,471
It's one of my favorite
moments in "Teen Wolf,"

6
00:00:11,538 --> 00:00:13,473
and the fans are still grieving about it

7
00:00:13,540 --> 00:00:14,841
and we're still grieving about it.

8
00:00:14,908 --> 00:00:17,076
So just put your werewolf
claws away and... and chill out.

9
00:00:18,579 --> 00:00:19,512
Can I stop screaming?

10
00:00:23,150 --> 00:00:24,217
It's hard to believe

11
00:00:24,284 --> 00:00:25,985
we've made 100 episodes of "Teen Wolf."

12
00:00:26,053 --> 00:00:27,820
So to celebrate, we will be looking back

13
00:00:27,888 --> 00:00:30,156
at the top-ten moments
of the entire series.

14
00:00:30,224 --> 00:00:31,491
_

15
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:34,193
- _
- Divine move.

16
00:00:34,261 --> 00:00:35,294
Divine move?

17
00:00:35,362 --> 00:00:36,996
You think you have any moves at all?

18
00:00:37,064 --> 00:00:38,598
You can kill the Oni, but me?

19
00:00:38,665 --> 00:00:39,599
Me?

20
00:00:39,666 --> 00:00:40,767
I'm a thousand years old!

21
00:00:40,834 --> 00:00:42,201
You can't kill me!

22
00:00:43,470 --> 00:00:44,904
Ooh!

23
00:00:44,972 --> 00:00:47,273
Ooh, Dylan O'Brien!

24
00:00:47,341 --> 00:00:49,809
"I'm a thousand years
old. You can't kill me!"

25
00:00:49,877 --> 00:00:52,378
Oh, watching that, I fell in
love with Dylan right there.

26
00:00:52,446 --> 00:00:55,381
The way that he said it, his face.

27
00:00:55,449 --> 00:00:56,816
Oh, he was so damn hot!

28
00:00:56,884 --> 00:00:58,084
I was like, "Okay."

29
00:00:58,152 --> 00:01:01,287
"You can't kill me" was
more than just a, you know,

30
00:01:01,355 --> 00:01:04,090
"You can't kill me
because I'm this powerful

31
00:01:04,158 --> 00:01:07,326
Nogitsune but I'm
inhabiting your best friend."

32
00:01:07,394 --> 00:01:09,395
I think out of any villain on the show,

33
00:01:09,463 --> 00:01:11,397
Void Stiles has been...
has been my favorite.

34
00:01:11,465 --> 00:01:13,733
One thing about comedic actors...

35
00:01:13,801 --> 00:01:15,802
and Dylan O'Brien is a great comedian...

36
00:01:15,869 --> 00:01:18,104
they all have a little
bit of darkness in them,

37
00:01:18,172 --> 00:01:20,239
and once you tap into that darkness,

38
00:01:20,307 --> 00:01:21,507
you can exploit it.

39
00:01:21,575 --> 00:01:25,378
That was the only time
I've ever really...

40
00:01:25,446 --> 00:01:26,813
gone into myself and be like,

41
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:28,414
"Wow, this is the epitome of acting."

42
00:01:28,482 --> 00:01:29,849
'Cause like Dylan and
I couldn't be closer,

43
00:01:29,917 --> 00:01:30,983
we couldn't be more friendly.

44
00:01:31,051 --> 00:01:31,984
We couldn't have been different.

45
00:01:32,052 --> 00:01:33,453
Our dynamic as Void Stiles and Scott

46
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:34,654
to Dylan and Tyler.

47
00:01:34,721 --> 00:01:35,955
Loved it.

48
00:01:36,023 --> 00:01:37,490
I think it definitely was
one of those moments on set

49
00:01:37,558 --> 00:01:39,358
where you knew it was gonna
have a lasting impression.

50
00:01:39,426 --> 00:01:41,794
It really makes you appreciate

51
00:01:41,862 --> 00:01:43,696
the talent that is in this show.

52
00:01:43,764 --> 00:01:46,466
I wanna eat a big bowl
of Dylan O'Brien-Os.

53
00:01:46,533 --> 00:01:47,900
_

54
00:01:48,501 --> 00:01:51,070
_

55
00:02:01,482 --> 00:02:03,116
- It's something as a fan...
- It's cool!

56
00:02:03,183 --> 00:02:04,650
... you really wanted to see.

57
00:02:04,718 --> 00:02:07,053
You wanted to see
someone fully shapeshift

58
00:02:07,121 --> 00:02:08,588
and I was glad it was Derek.

59
00:02:08,655 --> 00:02:09,789
- You've always wanted to see that?
- Yeah.

60
00:02:09,857 --> 00:02:10,857
Give me a sec.

61
00:02:13,961 --> 00:02:16,629
Something tells me
this is gonna be same...

62
00:02:16,697 --> 00:02:17,830
yup, about the same.

63
00:02:17,898 --> 00:02:20,266
Oh, we finally get to
see him in his wolf form

64
00:02:20,334 --> 00:02:21,834
and kill Kate.

65
00:02:21,902 --> 00:02:23,903
Please kill her.

66
00:02:31,345 --> 00:02:33,012
You're...

67
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:34,547
you were dead.

68
00:02:34,615 --> 00:02:35,648
No.

69
00:02:36,984 --> 00:02:38,284
I was evolving.

70
00:02:38,352 --> 00:02:40,620
In our mythology, developed the idea

71
00:02:40,687 --> 00:02:44,090
that, uh, that was the
highest state of power

72
00:02:44,158 --> 00:02:45,558
that a werewolf could achieve,

73
00:02:45,626 --> 00:02:47,393
becoming a full wolf.

74
00:02:47,461 --> 00:02:49,228
What about True Alpha?

75
00:02:49,296 --> 00:02:51,130
- That was... that's pretty high too.
- Okay.

76
00:02:51,198 --> 00:02:52,331
Well, it's interesting to think

77
00:02:52,399 --> 00:02:54,066
that might be an ability that only

78
00:02:54,134 --> 00:02:55,902
a born werewolf can have.

79
00:02:55,969 --> 00:02:58,404
So would Scott ever develop it?

80
00:02:58,472 --> 00:02:59,906
We'll have to wait and see.

81
00:02:59,973 --> 00:03:01,140
What do you think?

82
00:03:01,208 --> 00:03:02,742
Maybe Scott, instead of
turning into a full wolf,

83
00:03:02,809 --> 00:03:04,477
maybe he just turns into a bigger Scott.

84
00:03:04,545 --> 00:03:06,078
Like a... like a Hulk.

85
00:03:06,146 --> 00:03:07,947
He's just this really big Scott.

86
00:03:10,284 --> 00:03:11,417
Well, this is unexpected.

87
00:03:13,353 --> 00:03:14,520
The show brings people together,

88
00:03:14,588 --> 00:03:15,721
and whenever we go to Comic-Con,

89
00:03:15,789 --> 00:03:17,256
we're one of the biggest entities there

90
00:03:17,324 --> 00:03:19,025
strictly because of the fans.

91
00:03:19,092 --> 00:03:20,293
The energy in the room

92
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:23,062
at a "Teen Wolf" convention is hyped.

93
00:03:23,130 --> 00:03:25,765
Everybody there has one thing in common

94
00:03:25,832 --> 00:03:29,802
and it's that we all
love this show so much.

95
00:03:29,870 --> 00:03:33,506
I started a "Teen Wolf"
convention called Howler Con

96
00:03:33,574 --> 00:03:35,641
and now we're going on four years.

97
00:03:35,709 --> 00:03:39,812
It really makes you feel
like you are part of a family.

98
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:41,380
Like we are a wolf pack.

99
00:03:41,448 --> 00:03:44,250
I think MTV really created the space

100
00:03:44,318 --> 00:03:46,118
to have that kind of
relationship with the fans,

101
00:03:46,186 --> 00:03:47,987
that they feel like they're
a part of making "Teen Wolf."

102
00:03:49,223 --> 00:03:51,524
I'm so glad this moment
made it in the top ten.

103
00:03:51,592 --> 00:03:52,792
I love it.

104
00:03:52,859 --> 00:03:54,126
I love it!

105
00:03:54,194 --> 00:03:55,828
- _
- You find an anchor, right?

106
00:03:55,896 --> 00:03:57,863
- _
- Find your anchor.

107
00:03:57,931 --> 00:03:59,599
My anchor was Allison.

108
00:04:02,436 --> 00:04:03,903
I don't have Allison anymore.

109
00:04:03,971 --> 00:04:05,471
Then be your own anchor.

110
00:04:05,539 --> 00:04:07,540
I feel like that's one of those lessons

111
00:04:07,608 --> 00:04:08,908
that you can get from a show

112
00:04:08,976 --> 00:04:10,443
that you don't think that you can get.

113
00:04:10,510 --> 00:04:12,979
It really demonstrated
how Melissa has always

114
00:04:13,046 --> 00:04:15,281
pushed him to be the best
Scott that he could be.

115
00:04:15,349 --> 00:04:16,616
He could not be the leader of this pack

116
00:04:16,683 --> 00:04:18,284
if he didn't have Melissa as a leader

117
00:04:18,352 --> 00:04:19,518
to show him first.

118
00:04:19,586 --> 00:04:21,887
Sweetheart, let me tell you something

119
00:04:21,955 --> 00:04:23,856
no teenager ever believes.

120
00:04:23,924 --> 00:04:26,259
You fall in love more than once.

121
00:04:28,095 --> 00:04:29,962
It'll happen again.

122
00:04:30,030 --> 00:04:32,098
I promise.

123
00:04:32,165 --> 00:04:34,467
And until then...

124
00:04:34,534 --> 00:04:36,135
be your own anchor.

125
00:04:36,203 --> 00:04:38,170
That line... that whole
scene kind of changed my life.

126
00:04:38,238 --> 00:04:39,739
I was able to hear "be your own anchor"

127
00:04:39,806 --> 00:04:42,475
and breathe and get through

128
00:04:42,542 --> 00:04:43,776
whatever I was trying to get through.

129
00:04:43,844 --> 00:04:46,612
That scene came out
of my life, actually.

130
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:48,447
When I was going through a breakup

131
00:04:48,515 --> 00:04:51,050
and was really depressed about it,

132
00:04:51,118 --> 00:04:54,086
my own mother said, "You love
more than once in your life."

133
00:04:54,154 --> 00:04:55,521
And that stayed with me.

134
00:04:55,589 --> 00:04:58,157
Just to know that you...
you are all you need

135
00:04:58,225 --> 00:04:59,525
is a very like powerful statement

136
00:04:59,593 --> 00:05:00,993
for... for "Teen Wolf" to be making.

137
00:05:01,061 --> 00:05:04,563
It is one of Melissa's first
big like awesome moments.

138
00:05:04,631 --> 00:05:06,832
I wanted really to show

139
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:09,268
great relationships
between parents and kids,

140
00:05:09,336 --> 00:05:11,737
and to show them be
heroes in their own right.

141
00:05:11,805 --> 00:05:13,306
And it really is one
of the most touching

142
00:05:13,373 --> 00:05:15,775
mother-son relationships in... in TV.

143
00:05:16,843 --> 00:05:17,843
_

144
00:05:18,078 --> 00:05:19,545
- _
- Peter!

145
00:05:20,514 --> 00:05:22,415
- Malia.
- What?

146
00:05:22,482 --> 00:05:24,650
The only way we were able
to break through the Hunt...

147
00:05:26,553 --> 00:05:30,122
... is with an emotional connection.

148
00:05:30,190 --> 00:05:31,123
Dang.

149
00:05:31,191 --> 00:05:32,258
Wish I could help.

150
00:05:32,326 --> 00:05:34,327
I love the scenes in the train station.

151
00:05:34,394 --> 00:05:35,995
I think it's just such an epic set

152
00:05:36,063 --> 00:05:38,364
and I loved that Malia and Peter

153
00:05:38,432 --> 00:05:41,934
have this beautiful
family moment in that set

154
00:05:42,002 --> 00:05:44,236
because it was... just made
it that much more iconic.

155
00:05:44,304 --> 00:05:47,139
In a TV show like ours, to...

156
00:05:47,207 --> 00:05:49,475
which moves very fast through plot,

157
00:05:49,543 --> 00:05:52,678
we have the capacity to
take a villain like that

158
00:05:52,746 --> 00:05:54,113
and sort of humanize him.

159
00:05:54,181 --> 00:05:55,715
Uh, to an extent.

160
00:05:55,782 --> 00:05:57,316
And that's why we decided
to give him a daughter.

161
00:05:57,384 --> 00:05:58,551
Malia.

162
00:05:58,618 --> 00:06:00,586
And I love seeing their
relationship together.

163
00:06:00,654 --> 00:06:02,788
Say it like you mean it.

164
00:06:02,856 --> 00:06:04,790
Dad.

165
00:06:04,858 --> 00:06:05,925
Please wake up.

166
00:06:07,561 --> 00:06:08,527
Dad.

167
00:06:19,473 --> 00:06:21,741
Malia saying "Dad" to Peter

168
00:06:21,808 --> 00:06:23,342
is kind of like saying "I love you,"

169
00:06:23,410 --> 00:06:25,311
where you can't... you can't go back.

170
00:06:25,379 --> 00:06:26,545
It's said.

171
00:06:26,613 --> 00:06:28,314
It's an important
moment in "Teen Wolf" too

172
00:06:28,382 --> 00:06:31,050
because it shows something

173
00:06:31,118 --> 00:06:32,418
that we've always tried to communicate,

174
00:06:32,486 --> 00:06:34,253
which is heroism doesn't necessarily

175
00:06:34,321 --> 00:06:36,589
need to come from brute strength.

176
00:06:36,656 --> 00:06:38,624
It can come from emotional connection,

177
00:06:38,692 --> 00:06:39,959
and I love that about it.

178
00:06:40,026 --> 00:06:41,527
And that's so cool because all Peter is

179
00:06:41,595 --> 00:06:43,062
- is brute strength, you know?
- Mm-hmm.

180
00:06:43,130 --> 00:06:45,331
It shows that he, you
know, he's got a heart

181
00:06:45,399 --> 00:06:46,532
- somewhere in there...
- Yeah.

182
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:48,901
... beneath the... the pecks.

183
00:06:53,940 --> 00:06:56,742
Who would be crowned best dancer?

184
00:06:56,810 --> 00:06:58,411
Probably Dylan O'Brien.

185
00:06:58,478 --> 00:07:02,782
Dylan and Posey would be the...

186
00:07:02,849 --> 00:07:04,750
the king and the king
of the dance floor.

187
00:07:04,818 --> 00:07:06,786
I've seen Shelley put
it down a few times.

188
00:07:06,853 --> 00:07:08,988
She does this thing
where she kind of is able

189
00:07:09,055 --> 00:07:11,757
to move her body and kind of
sexily look over her shoulder.

190
00:07:11,825 --> 00:07:13,626
Who's the best dancer on "Teen Wolf"?

191
00:07:13,693 --> 00:07:14,860
That would be me.

192
00:07:14,928 --> 00:07:16,328
And my best move, uh...

193
00:07:17,431 --> 00:07:18,364
You can't choose just one.

194
00:07:22,922 --> 00:07:26,124
Fandom of the Year goes to...

195
00:07:26,192 --> 00:07:27,159
"Teen Wolf"!

196
00:07:29,395 --> 00:07:30,596
Thank you, thank you.

197
00:07:30,663 --> 00:07:32,230
You guys drive our show.

198
00:07:32,298 --> 00:07:33,332
You make it worthwhile.

199
00:07:33,399 --> 00:07:34,333
We just love you guys.

200
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:36,602
And so this means the world to us.

201
00:07:36,669 --> 00:07:39,304
I think the unique
thing about "Teen Wolf"

202
00:07:39,372 --> 00:07:41,540
and the cast with their fans

203
00:07:41,608 --> 00:07:43,175
is that they're so involved.

204
00:07:43,242 --> 00:07:45,344
It's really important to us...

205
00:07:45,411 --> 00:07:47,913
to see... see that interaction
and have that with them.

206
00:07:47,981 --> 00:07:50,048
I think that they just feel that real,

207
00:07:50,116 --> 00:07:52,150
sincere, genuine love for them.

208
00:07:52,218 --> 00:07:54,686
I've gotten to travel the
world and meet "Teen Wolf" fans

209
00:07:54,754 --> 00:07:56,121
and hearing their stories.

210
00:07:56,189 --> 00:07:57,556
I know that will always reign supreme

211
00:07:57,624 --> 00:08:00,892
in how much I feel
like I know all of them.

212
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:03,195
I think that's really what's
made it so special to me

213
00:08:03,262 --> 00:08:05,364
is the sense of community.

214
00:08:05,431 --> 00:08:08,467
Everyone who is a fan of "Teen Wolf"

215
00:08:08,534 --> 00:08:09,568
is... is a pack.

216
00:08:09,636 --> 00:08:11,370
100 episodes is extraordinary to me.

217
00:08:11,437 --> 00:08:12,371
And it's all do to the fans.

218
00:08:13,806 --> 00:08:16,808
So this next moment is one
of my absolute favorites.

219
00:08:16,876 --> 00:08:17,943
- ♪ _

220
00:08:18,011 --> 00:08:18,944
Lydia!

221
00:08:19,012 --> 00:08:19,945
- No!
- Don't!

222
00:08:19,946 --> 00:08:21,046
_

223
00:08:29,022 --> 00:08:31,657
Lydia discovering that she's a Banshee

224
00:08:31,724 --> 00:08:34,326
was a pivotal moment for her character.

225
00:08:34,394 --> 00:08:36,395
It seems like as soon
as you know Lydia Martin,

226
00:08:36,462 --> 00:08:39,631
there's another side of her
that we didn't know was there.

227
00:08:39,699 --> 00:08:41,233
Unbelievable.

228
00:08:43,503 --> 00:08:45,404
You have no idea what you are, do you?

229
00:08:47,106 --> 00:08:49,675
The wailing woman.

230
00:08:49,742 --> 00:08:53,245
A Banshee, right before my eyes.

231
00:08:53,312 --> 00:08:54,780
Lydia finding out she was a Banshee

232
00:08:54,847 --> 00:08:58,684
meant that the show had...

233
00:08:58,751 --> 00:09:01,853
a clairvoyant, basically,
that could predict death

234
00:09:01,921 --> 00:09:02,988
more than just a sniff.

235
00:09:03,056 --> 00:09:04,256
It's more like a curse.

236
00:09:04,323 --> 00:09:05,891
You need someone to
discover the dead bodies.

237
00:09:05,958 --> 00:09:08,393
This gave us a great excuse
to have it always be her.

238
00:09:08,461 --> 00:09:09,895
It made Lydia part
of the pack, you know?

239
00:09:09,962 --> 00:09:11,897
We all... we all had this
thing in common with each other.

240
00:09:11,964 --> 00:09:13,899
This just adds more diversity

241
00:09:13,966 --> 00:09:16,968
and coolness to the pack as a whole.

242
00:09:17,036 --> 00:09:19,204
Just seeing her scream
for the first time,

243
00:09:19,272 --> 00:09:20,405
you're like, "Oh my God."

244
00:09:20,473 --> 00:09:21,907
Like it was just haunting.

245
00:09:21,974 --> 00:09:24,376
I would say I always
had a bit of a, I guess,

246
00:09:24,444 --> 00:09:25,811
louder scream,

247
00:09:25,878 --> 00:09:28,413
and I actually slightly
ripped my vocal cords,

248
00:09:28,481 --> 00:09:31,049
uh, while screaming for the
first two or three years.

249
00:09:31,117 --> 00:09:32,651
Who doesn't want a raspy voice, though?

250
00:09:32,719 --> 00:09:33,652
Yeah, sexy.

251
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:35,153
_

252
00:09:35,754 --> 00:09:37,654
_

253
00:10:00,346 --> 00:10:03,515
This moment of Scott
becoming a true Alpha

254
00:10:03,583 --> 00:10:05,283
and breaking through the Mountain Ash

255
00:10:05,351 --> 00:10:07,986
is so important because most Alphas

256
00:10:08,054 --> 00:10:11,022
have to actually kill another Alpha

257
00:10:11,090 --> 00:10:13,024
in order to become an Alpha.

258
00:10:13,092 --> 00:10:15,560
That's when we came
up with this idea that

259
00:10:15,628 --> 00:10:18,196
by being a really good person,

260
00:10:18,264 --> 00:10:19,831
by sheer force of will,

261
00:10:19,899 --> 00:10:23,201
he could make his eyes
go from yellow to red.

262
00:10:23,269 --> 00:10:25,270
It was like, you know,
when like Luke Skywalker

263
00:10:25,338 --> 00:10:27,105
gets his lightsaber,

264
00:10:27,173 --> 00:10:29,040
or when Captain America
gets his shield, you know?

265
00:10:29,108 --> 00:10:31,209
It's like now Scott has his eyes.

266
00:10:31,277 --> 00:10:33,678
I think in that moment
Scott really changed

267
00:10:33,746 --> 00:10:36,281
and like metaphorically becoming a man.

268
00:10:39,485 --> 00:10:40,886
I'm an Alpha now.

269
00:10:40,953 --> 00:10:42,654
Now it's Scott McCall
and Scott McCall's pack

270
00:10:42,722 --> 00:10:43,955
and we're ready to roll with him.

271
00:10:44,023 --> 00:10:45,957
It's one of my favorite
moments in "Teen Wolf."

272
00:10:46,025 --> 00:10:46,958
Me too.

273
00:10:49,962 --> 00:10:53,031
Who is most likely to
steal something from set?

274
00:10:53,099 --> 00:10:54,166
We have a couple kleptos.

275
00:10:54,233 --> 00:10:55,400
Uh, Ryan Kelley.

276
00:10:55,468 --> 00:10:57,536
I feel like Ryan Kelley would be someone

277
00:10:57,603 --> 00:10:59,271
who would steal something on set,

278
00:10:59,338 --> 00:11:01,273
and I really have
nothing to back that up.

279
00:11:01,340 --> 00:11:03,942
I took the name plate,
I took my shirt, um,

280
00:11:04,010 --> 00:11:05,777
and I'm gonna have it
all framed in nice things,

281
00:11:05,845 --> 00:11:07,145
and I may have taken some other things

282
00:11:07,213 --> 00:11:08,313
but I can't tell you about that.

283
00:11:08,381 --> 00:11:09,748
Me.

284
00:11:09,816 --> 00:11:11,483
I am most likely to steal everything.

285
00:11:11,551 --> 00:11:12,784
I've stolen everything already.

286
00:11:12,852 --> 00:11:14,186
I know I've stolen a couple of things.

287
00:11:14,253 --> 00:11:16,521
Um, actually, from this locker room.

288
00:11:16,589 --> 00:11:17,622
A lot of socks.

289
00:11:17,690 --> 00:11:18,623
Oh my God.

290
00:11:18,691 --> 00:11:19,758
I don't ever leave socks.

291
00:11:19,826 --> 00:11:20,992
I have so many socks now.

292
00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:21,993
Thanks, MTV.

293
00:11:26,338 --> 00:11:28,773
Okay, so we can't talk about
the top moments of "Teen Wolf"

294
00:11:28,841 --> 00:11:29,941
without talking about this one.

295
00:11:30,009 --> 00:11:31,175
_

296
00:11:31,476 --> 00:11:34,336
_

297
00:11:34,780 --> 00:11:36,147
Stydia is so sweet.

298
00:11:37,816 --> 00:11:39,884
I think I wanna add them
to my morning coffee.

299
00:11:39,952 --> 00:11:43,688
The Stiles and Lydia kiss/reunion moment

300
00:11:43,756 --> 00:11:45,757
was one of the biggest payoffs

301
00:11:45,824 --> 00:11:48,259
of one of the longest
running threads in the show.

302
00:11:48,327 --> 00:11:50,762
This was a big fight
in the writers' room

303
00:11:50,829 --> 00:11:53,965
between people who
wanted Stiles and Lydia

304
00:11:54,033 --> 00:11:55,233
to get... get together

305
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:56,434
and people who didn't.

306
00:11:56,502 --> 00:11:58,536
And then it's just I
watch those moments,

307
00:11:58,604 --> 00:12:00,538
those scenes where
they're perfect together.

308
00:12:00,606 --> 00:12:03,374
It really satisfied six years of waiting

309
00:12:03,442 --> 00:12:05,543
for like, "Yes, please just be together.

310
00:12:05,611 --> 00:12:06,978
You belong together."

311
00:12:10,082 --> 00:12:11,015
I didn't say it back.

312
00:12:12,317 --> 00:12:13,484
You don't have to.

313
00:12:30,702 --> 00:12:31,903
Mwah.

314
00:12:31,970 --> 00:12:33,071
Mwah!

315
00:12:33,138 --> 00:12:35,440
You don't even have to
be a fan of "Teen Wolf"

316
00:12:35,507 --> 00:12:37,442
to recognize how powerful this scene is.

317
00:12:37,509 --> 00:12:40,645
I loved that Jeff said
it has to be organic

318
00:12:40,712 --> 00:12:42,914
and that it's just
not gonna be one season

319
00:12:42,981 --> 00:12:44,148
they're all of a sudden dating.

320
00:12:44,216 --> 00:12:45,716
Everything changed in that moment.

321
00:12:45,784 --> 00:12:46,784
Yeah, that's a great moment.

322
00:12:46,852 --> 00:12:47,885
She's got those lips.

323
00:12:47,953 --> 00:12:49,120
Yeah.

324
00:12:49,188 --> 00:12:50,922
She pulls away and it's
just the look in her face

325
00:12:50,989 --> 00:12:52,924
is so sweet and... oh, I love it.

326
00:12:52,991 --> 00:12:54,225
Love it.

327
00:12:54,293 --> 00:12:55,593
Yeah, I think it's great.

328
00:12:55,661 --> 00:12:56,727
I love those guys.

329
00:12:56,795 --> 00:12:58,396
I miss them.

330
00:12:58,464 --> 00:12:59,630
- Aw...
- Shut up.

331
00:12:59,698 --> 00:13:00,932
- ♪ _

332
00:13:00,999 --> 00:13:04,068
- _
- When Stiles was a little kid...

333
00:13:04,136 --> 00:13:05,303
he couldn't say his first name.

334
00:13:06,505 --> 00:13:07,972
Not sure why.

335
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:09,373
It pretty much rolls off the tongue.

336
00:13:09,441 --> 00:13:11,309
But, uh,

337
00:13:11,376 --> 00:13:14,679
the closest he could get was "mischief."

338
00:13:14,746 --> 00:13:16,747
One of "Teen Wolf's"
longest-running mysteries

339
00:13:16,815 --> 00:13:18,349
is not a supernatural questions,

340
00:13:18,417 --> 00:13:20,418
it's not about monsters
or lower mythology;

341
00:13:20,486 --> 00:13:22,120
it's what is Stiles' first name?

342
00:13:22,187 --> 00:13:24,222
We've been waiting for
it, we've been wanting it,

343
00:13:24,289 --> 00:13:25,523
and now that we have it,

344
00:13:25,591 --> 00:13:26,557
we can't pronounce it.

345
00:13:28,327 --> 00:13:32,396
Uh... isn't it Midavich Stilinski?

346
00:13:32,464 --> 00:13:34,265
Can you say the name?

347
00:13:34,333 --> 00:13:35,433
Mieczyslaw.

348
00:13:35,501 --> 00:13:38,369
Mieczyslaw, that is beautiful!

349
00:13:38,437 --> 00:13:39,504
Mieczyslaw.

350
00:13:39,571 --> 00:13:41,706
I will praise Jeff Davis forever

351
00:13:41,773 --> 00:13:43,274
that it was something difficult.

352
00:13:43,342 --> 00:13:46,177
I still can't remember how to spell it.

353
00:13:46,245 --> 00:13:47,278
I don't think I could
spell it right now.

354
00:13:47,346 --> 00:13:48,279
No.

355
00:13:48,347 --> 00:13:49,547
I had to write it down.

356
00:13:49,615 --> 00:13:51,516
Did Scott know what his name was?

357
00:13:51,583 --> 00:13:52,850
- Yes.
- Do you think he did? Okay.

358
00:13:52,918 --> 00:13:55,853
Stilinski revealing
his name in that moment

359
00:13:55,921 --> 00:13:57,822
among all those people felt perfect.

360
00:13:59,525 --> 00:14:00,525
I have a son.

361
00:14:03,462 --> 00:14:06,664
His name is Mieczyslaw Stilinski,

362
00:14:06,732 --> 00:14:07,732
but we call him Stiles.

363
00:14:10,536 --> 00:14:11,836
I remember.

364
00:14:11,904 --> 00:14:13,905
Towards the end of "Teen Wolf"

365
00:14:13,972 --> 00:14:17,041
there were a lot of revisions
for the scripts, each episode.

366
00:14:17,109 --> 00:14:20,545
Linden walks in and in rehearsal...

367
00:14:20,612 --> 00:14:23,080
I thought Linden was
just pulling a prank

368
00:14:23,148 --> 00:14:25,316
and in fact that was
actually Stiles' name.

369
00:14:25,384 --> 00:14:26,817
We thought it would be
some like funny payoff

370
00:14:26,885 --> 00:14:28,052
to find some wacky name

371
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:30,154
but instead it was the
most like heartbreaking

372
00:14:30,222 --> 00:14:31,556
and heart-wrenching reveal

373
00:14:31,623 --> 00:14:34,492
and is one of the most
creative and moving things

374
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:35,493
that "Teen Wolf" ever did.

375
00:14:37,095 --> 00:14:39,664
What I love about "Teen
Wolf" the most is when

376
00:14:39,731 --> 00:14:41,966
not just a person
watches the show for fun

377
00:14:42,034 --> 00:14:43,668
but it's actually affected their life.

378
00:14:43,735 --> 00:14:45,703
The fan art is especially
meaningful to me.

379
00:14:45,771 --> 00:14:47,038
I wanted to be a comic book artist

380
00:14:47,105 --> 00:14:48,339
when I was a kid,

381
00:14:48,407 --> 00:14:50,741
and to see that people
are inspired by the show,

382
00:14:50,809 --> 00:14:52,743
uh, to make their own artwork,

383
00:14:52,811 --> 00:14:54,045
it's just incredible.

384
00:14:54,112 --> 00:14:56,714
I put my art online and someone from MTV

385
00:14:56,782 --> 00:15:00,384
decided to reach out, and it's
opened my world in so many ways.

386
00:15:00,452 --> 00:15:01,819
I can't thank "Teen Wolf" enough

387
00:15:01,887 --> 00:15:03,588
for giving me that
opportunity to really see

388
00:15:03,655 --> 00:15:05,556
how my art impacts people.

389
00:15:05,624 --> 00:15:08,292
I won their walk-on role contest

390
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:10,194
and then to say that my first

391
00:15:10,262 --> 00:15:13,297
professional acting job
was my favorite show...

392
00:15:13,365 --> 00:15:15,733
that... that's amazing.

393
00:15:15,801 --> 00:15:18,836
We ended up making a
rap video that MTV saw

394
00:15:18,904 --> 00:15:21,539
and we eventually became
known as The Wolf Pack Girls.

395
00:15:21,607 --> 00:15:25,376
We literally have no idea
where in life we would

396
00:15:25,444 --> 00:15:28,045
both be right now if it
wasn't for "Teen Wolf."

397
00:15:28,113 --> 00:15:30,915
I've had kids come up to
me as well and say that

398
00:15:30,983 --> 00:15:32,750
the way that teens are portrayed

399
00:15:32,818 --> 00:15:34,619
and the way that, uh, gay kids

400
00:15:34,686 --> 00:15:35,987
are portrayed on the show

401
00:15:36,054 --> 00:15:37,288
have changed things for them.

402
00:15:37,356 --> 00:15:38,389
That's powerful.

403
00:15:38,457 --> 00:15:39,991
- ♪ _

404
00:15:39,992 --> 00:15:41,992
_

405
00:15:42,194 --> 00:15:43,461
I can't.

406
00:15:45,530 --> 00:15:46,497
I can't take your pain.

407
00:15:49,101 --> 00:15:50,268
It's because it doesn't hurt.

408
00:15:51,737 --> 00:15:53,904
Allison dying in Scott's arms

409
00:15:53,972 --> 00:15:56,974
was one of the biggest
moments in "Teen Wolf."

410
00:15:57,042 --> 00:15:58,576
Because the show started
with Scott and Allison.

411
00:15:58,644 --> 00:15:59,744
That was their first love.

412
00:15:59,811 --> 00:16:01,812
It was the first like real relationship

413
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:03,581
that we got to see develop on the show.

414
00:16:03,649 --> 00:16:05,516
We got to ride that wave

415
00:16:05,584 --> 00:16:07,385
as if we were Scott's best friend.

416
00:16:07,452 --> 00:16:09,587
And the fans are still grieving about it

417
00:16:09,655 --> 00:16:11,289
and we're still grieving about it.

418
00:16:11,356 --> 00:16:12,523
I can't watch the scene.

419
00:16:12,591 --> 00:16:13,691
- I have trouble watching...
- Do you really?

420
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:15,526
It's like watching
one of my children die.

421
00:16:15,594 --> 00:16:17,395
It's okay.

422
00:16:17,462 --> 00:16:18,496
Allison...

423
00:16:20,532 --> 00:16:22,600
It's okay.

424
00:16:22,668 --> 00:16:24,302
It's okay.

425
00:16:24,369 --> 00:16:25,770
It's okay.

426
00:16:25,837 --> 00:16:26,837
It's perfect.

427
00:16:29,474 --> 00:16:31,876
I'm in the arms of my first love.

428
00:16:34,479 --> 00:16:36,681
The first person I've ever loved.

429
00:16:36,748 --> 00:16:38,449
The person I'll always love.

430
00:16:38,517 --> 00:16:40,484
In the same way that Scott
became his own anchor,

431
00:16:40,552 --> 00:16:42,720
Allison became her own heroine.

432
00:16:42,788 --> 00:16:45,222
She wasn't just a love
interest; she was a hero.

433
00:16:45,290 --> 00:16:47,325
And I think this moment

434
00:16:47,392 --> 00:16:49,694
was raising the stakes for the show.

435
00:16:49,761 --> 00:16:52,697
It brought in themes and ideas

436
00:16:52,764 --> 00:16:56,267
and... and, uh, that
we hadn't tried before.

437
00:16:56,335 --> 00:16:58,402
Real tragedy and real loss.

438
00:16:58,470 --> 00:16:59,904
And it was something that Scott

439
00:16:59,971 --> 00:17:00,971
had never gone through.

440
00:17:01,039 --> 00:17:02,640
This was really, really big for Scott

441
00:17:02,708 --> 00:17:04,642
and it kind of changed
the way that I played him

442
00:17:04,710 --> 00:17:05,710
throughout the rest of the series.

443
00:17:09,147 --> 00:17:11,048
The person that's least
likely to text back

444
00:17:11,116 --> 00:17:13,384
is probably Khylin Rhambo.

445
00:17:13,452 --> 00:17:16,387
It's not that they are
never gonna text back

446
00:17:16,455 --> 00:17:18,756
but sometimes it might take a few days,

447
00:17:18,824 --> 00:17:19,857
and that's Holland.

448
00:17:19,925 --> 00:17:21,359
That answer's easy, it's Hoechlin.

449
00:17:21,426 --> 00:17:22,360
He doesn't text.

450
00:17:22,427 --> 00:17:24,662
Tyler Hoechlin, 100% every time.

451
00:17:24,730 --> 00:17:26,330
He's impossible to get a hold of.

452
00:17:26,398 --> 00:17:27,331
I don't know if he's...

453
00:17:27,399 --> 00:17:28,366
like he has some app on his phone

454
00:17:28,433 --> 00:17:29,500
that just texts don't come through.

455
00:17:29,568 --> 00:17:31,569
Pick up, brother, I'm here, I love you.

456
00:17:31,636 --> 00:17:32,870
Call me.

457
00:17:36,651 --> 00:17:38,485
It was so hard to pick just ten moments,

458
00:17:38,553 --> 00:17:39,486
so here's a bonus.

459
00:17:39,554 --> 00:17:40,587
Yes!

460
00:17:40,588 --> 00:17:42,588
_

461
00:17:51,599 --> 00:17:52,933
Watching the premiere of "Teen Wolf,"

462
00:17:53,001 --> 00:17:55,035
I was such a huge fan of
like the movie "Teen Wolf"

463
00:17:55,103 --> 00:17:56,503
as a kid growing up

464
00:17:56,571 --> 00:17:58,906
and so I was like, "All right,
how are they going to do this?"

465
00:17:58,973 --> 00:18:00,207
But then I realized like watching it,

466
00:18:00,275 --> 00:18:01,942
I was like this is
actually like terrifying.

467
00:18:02,010 --> 00:18:04,511
This is where the teen becomes the wolf.

468
00:18:04,579 --> 00:18:05,512
This is the scene that really

469
00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:06,680
pulls you into the show.

470
00:18:06,748 --> 00:18:09,082
It set like the danger level very high

471
00:18:09,150 --> 00:18:10,184
from the very beginning.

472
00:18:15,723 --> 00:18:18,358
It's a huge moment
in "Teen Wolf" history

473
00:18:18,426 --> 00:18:20,160
that needs to be part of this top ten.

474
00:18:20,228 --> 00:18:21,161
_

475
00:18:22,330 --> 00:18:25,432
I think by far the...
the biggest fan response,

476
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:28,335
um, and... and for me personally...

477
00:18:28,403 --> 00:18:29,636
whenever... whenever somebody asks me

478
00:18:29,704 --> 00:18:31,472
what's the most pivotal, crazy,

479
00:18:31,539 --> 00:18:33,974
most powerful, impactful
moment on the show,

480
00:18:34,042 --> 00:18:37,411
it's the "Scott, you're
my brother" moment

481
00:18:37,479 --> 00:18:39,012
where Stiles saves my life...

482
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:40,247
or Scott's life.

483
00:18:40,315 --> 00:18:41,915
It felt a little like
your life, didn't it?

484
00:18:41,983 --> 00:18:43,016
It did, yeah.

485
00:18:43,084 --> 00:18:44,618
I think it speaks to

486
00:18:44,686 --> 00:18:46,119
how close you and Dylan are.

487
00:18:50,658 --> 00:18:51,758
Scott, just listen to me, okay?

488
00:18:53,361 --> 00:18:54,361
You're not no one.

489
00:18:57,131 --> 00:18:58,499
Okay, you're someone, you're...

490
00:19:00,201 --> 00:19:03,136
Scott, you're my best friend...

491
00:19:03,204 --> 00:19:04,271
okay, and I need you.

492
00:19:05,773 --> 00:19:06,874
Scott, you're my brother.

493
00:19:08,443 --> 00:19:10,711
All right, so...

494
00:19:10,778 --> 00:19:12,946
so if you're gonna do this, then...

495
00:19:13,014 --> 00:19:14,448
I think you're just gonna
have to take me with you.

496
00:19:26,127 --> 00:19:27,661
Oh my God.

497
00:19:27,729 --> 00:19:28,896
"You're my brother."

498
00:19:28,963 --> 00:19:31,632
That was what like forged them into

499
00:19:31,699 --> 00:19:34,167
more than just a pack, you know, it's...

500
00:19:34,235 --> 00:19:35,502
- Strengthen their bond.
- Yeah.

501
00:19:35,570 --> 00:19:39,039
I mean, so much of the show is Scott

502
00:19:39,107 --> 00:19:40,674
saving Stiles,

503
00:19:40,742 --> 00:19:44,878
and in this scene we
see Stiles saves Scott.

504
00:19:44,946 --> 00:19:46,313
One of the most powerful things to me

505
00:19:46,381 --> 00:19:49,917
about that scene is the words he speaks,

506
00:19:49,984 --> 00:19:53,654
uh, "If you die, you're
gonna take me with you."

507
00:19:53,721 --> 00:19:55,789
Uh, in a dark time of my own life,

508
00:19:55,857 --> 00:19:57,958
someone spoke those exact words to me.

509
00:19:58,026 --> 00:19:59,293
I think that will always go down

510
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:01,562
as one of the best moments
in "Teen Wolf" history.

511
00:20:01,629 --> 00:20:02,563
So good, so sweet.

512
00:20:02,630 --> 00:20:04,298
I'm... I'm chocking back tears.

513
00:20:04,365 --> 00:20:06,500
Should I let them fly?

514
00:20:06,568 --> 00:20:07,868
I can't, no.

515
00:20:07,936 --> 00:20:09,436
Don't wanna mess up my makeup.

516
00:20:09,504 --> 00:20:11,238
You have no makeup on.
You're right, I don't.

517
00:20:12,540 --> 00:20:16,176
You guys have singlehandedly
made "Teen Wolf."

518
00:20:16,244 --> 00:20:18,845
We love you, thank you
for sticking around.

519
00:20:18,913 --> 00:20:22,683
I know it's been a crazy,
insane, heartbreaking ride.

520
00:20:22,750 --> 00:20:26,386
I hope you guys enjoy the
final episodes of "Teen Wolf."
