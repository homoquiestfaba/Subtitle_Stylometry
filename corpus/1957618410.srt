1
00:00:01,475 --> 00:00:04,975
(upbeat electronic music)

2
00:00:16,639 --> 00:00:17,578
- Ladies and gentlemen,

3
00:00:17,578 --> 00:00:18,757
my name is Carlo Gigante,

4
00:00:18,757 --> 00:00:21,140
and I'm delighted to
be your cruise director

5
00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:22,130
on your ultimate vacation,

6
00:00:22,130 --> 00:00:24,337
Star Cruise's flight to the moon.

7
00:00:24,337 --> 00:00:27,140
Ladies and gentlemen, my
name is Carlo Gigante,

8
00:00:27,140 --> 00:00:28,853
and I'm delighted to be your.

9
00:00:30,058 --> 00:00:32,225
(sighing)

10
00:00:34,916 --> 00:00:36,042
(clearing throat)

11
00:00:36,042 --> 00:00:39,634
(tense electronic music)

12
00:00:39,634 --> 00:00:40,467
How are you?

13
00:00:40,467 --> 00:00:41,300
Good to see you.

14
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:42,315
Good to see you, as well.

15
00:00:42,315 --> 00:00:43,148
How are you?

16
00:00:43,148 --> 00:00:43,981
Good to see ya.

17
00:00:43,981 --> 00:00:45,564
Hi, nice to see ya.

18
00:00:46,420 --> 00:00:48,258
Good to see you all here,

19
00:00:48,258 --> 00:00:49,724
what a party we're gonna have,

20
00:00:49,724 --> 00:00:50,562
this is the place to be.

21
00:00:50,562 --> 00:00:52,274
Welcome, welcome all.

22
00:00:52,274 --> 00:00:53,677
How're ya?

23
00:00:53,677 --> 00:00:56,427
Ah, you made it, good to see you.

24
00:00:58,200 --> 00:00:59,973
Ladies and gentlemen,

25
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:03,340
my name is Carlo Gigante,

26
00:01:03,340 --> 00:01:05,640
and I'm delighted to
be your cruise director

27
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:10,640
on your ultimate vacation, Star
Cruise's flight to the moon.

28
00:01:11,074 --> 00:01:11,907
- [Man] Yeah!

29
00:01:11,907 --> 00:01:13,693
(crowd cheering)

30
00:01:13,693 --> 00:01:14,840
I'll make you a promise,

31
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:17,000
we are gonna have fun.

32
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,469
Hell, we better, y'all paid
a million dollars to be here.

33
00:01:19,469 --> 00:01:21,310
(crowd laughing)

34
00:01:21,310 --> 00:01:23,730
Every day, every day
you can call up the menu

35
00:01:23,730 --> 00:01:24,980
on your bedside computer,

36
00:01:24,980 --> 00:01:27,530
which will give you a schedule
of the day's activities,

37
00:01:27,530 --> 00:01:30,971
like today's knobbly knees contest.

38
00:01:30,971 --> 00:01:32,441
(crowd laughing)

39
00:01:32,441 --> 00:01:33,274
(Carlo tutting)

40
00:01:33,274 --> 00:01:35,173
Don't be shy, come right on up.

41
00:01:36,380 --> 00:01:37,830
- A little money, sit back,

42
00:01:37,830 --> 00:01:39,861
let me take care of the rest.

43
00:01:39,861 --> 00:01:41,045
Are you interested?

44
00:01:41,045 --> 00:01:41,878
Think about it.

45
00:01:41,878 --> 00:01:43,190
The first space colony casino

46
00:01:43,190 --> 00:01:44,977
and you'd be in on it

47
00:01:44,977 --> 00:01:45,810
from the ground floor,

48
00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:46,643
you'd make a fortune.

49
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:50,400
- I'm already worth a fortune.

50
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:52,745
Why would I need to make another one?

51
00:01:52,745 --> 00:01:55,495
(crowd cheering)

52
00:01:56,572 --> 00:01:57,416
- How'd it go?

53
00:01:57,416 --> 00:01:58,249
(laughing)

54
00:01:58,249 --> 00:01:59,082
- I've heard of knobbly knees

55
00:01:59,082 --> 00:01:59,915
but these beat the band.

56
00:01:59,915 --> 00:02:02,665
(crowd laughing)

57
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:04,780
These are the flattest knees

58
00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:06,633
in the history of the nominees.

59
00:02:06,633 --> 00:02:08,009
- Aw, poor Vincent.

60
00:02:08,009 --> 00:02:09,410
You'll get all the investors you need

61
00:02:09,410 --> 00:02:12,023
for your colony casino, you always do.

62
00:02:13,951 --> 00:02:16,663
- Do you know, you're the
sexiest woman in outer space?

63
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,593
- Look, over there.

64
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,610
Vincent and Monica Miles.

65
00:02:24,610 --> 00:02:27,443
They're named in People
magazine practically every week,

66
00:02:27,443 --> 00:02:29,390
and that's Warren Wayne, the tennis star.

67
00:02:29,390 --> 00:02:31,062
He's won Wimbledon four times.

68
00:02:31,062 --> 00:02:32,418
- US.

69
00:02:32,418 --> 00:02:34,770
There I was, love 40

70
00:02:34,770 --> 00:02:37,470
match point against the suicide Swede

71
00:02:38,390 --> 00:02:39,983
and did I rally.

72
00:02:39,983 --> 00:02:40,917
I kicked his ass.

73
00:02:43,204 --> 00:02:45,124
- You're the girl who won the contest?

74
00:02:45,124 --> 00:02:46,417
- It's that obvious, huh?

75
00:02:46,417 --> 00:02:48,280
- That's a compliment.

76
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:50,650
You won't find them getting
very impressed with each other.

77
00:02:50,650 --> 00:02:52,306
(crowd laughing)

78
00:02:52,306 --> 00:02:54,610
- We have a winner, folks.

79
00:02:54,610 --> 00:02:57,430
Edward Tubin from Sioux Falls, Idaho,

80
00:02:57,430 --> 00:03:00,330
has the knobbiest knees in outer space.

81
00:03:00,330 --> 00:03:01,587
(laughing)

82
00:03:01,587 --> 00:03:02,570
Congratulations.
(crowd laughing)

83
00:03:02,570 --> 00:03:05,940
- Mr. Bohm and Ms. Marshall,

84
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:08,293
would you like a complimentary cocktail?

85
00:03:14,510 --> 00:03:16,020
- I don't like the way
he calls me by my name.

86
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:17,550
It gives me the creeps.

87
00:03:17,550 --> 00:03:18,550
- [Man] Excuse me.

88
00:03:18,550 --> 00:03:19,383
- [Ms. Marshall] I
mean, no one is supposed

89
00:03:19,383 --> 00:03:20,216
to know about us.

90
00:03:20,216 --> 00:03:21,770
- He's Android for Christ's sake,

91
00:03:21,770 --> 00:03:23,200
he's not gonna tell my wife.

92
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:24,940
(soft parlor piano music)

93
00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:26,512
- How are you this evening?

94
00:03:26,512 --> 00:03:27,430
(electronic beeping)

95
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:28,653
Dawn Taggert?

96
00:03:29,866 --> 00:03:30,699
- Fine.

97
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:33,900
Mac.

98
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:34,790
How are you?

99
00:03:34,790 --> 00:03:36,297
- Very well, thank you.

100
00:03:39,290 --> 00:03:40,840
Can I assist you with anything?

101
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:42,713
- No, thanks.

102
00:03:42,713 --> 00:03:44,580
I thought I'd take a look around the ship.

103
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:46,180
- [Mac] Certainly, Dawn Taggert.

104
00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:49,190
- I've never been to outer space before.

105
00:03:54,518 --> 00:03:55,351
(electronic beeping)

106
00:03:55,351 --> 00:03:57,230
- So, how does our space cruiser compared

107
00:03:57,230 --> 00:03:59,056
to shuttle work, Barnes?

108
00:03:59,056 --> 00:04:02,260
- Well, the Star Princess
has wins hands down.

109
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:04,590
- Well, it's good to have you aboard.

110
00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:07,063
We can always use someone
with your computer background.

111
00:04:08,370 --> 00:04:10,530
- Don't tell anyone but
I'm actually working

112
00:04:10,530 --> 00:04:13,680
on a patent for one of
my software designs.

113
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:14,870
- That's great.

114
00:04:14,870 --> 00:04:16,040
- Why don't you hit the EVS for me?

115
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:17,137
- Check.

116
00:04:17,137 --> 00:04:18,137
- Thank you.

117
00:04:21,328 --> 00:04:23,120
- Have you seen Gibson?

118
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:24,870
- Captain has him doing
a maintenance check

119
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:27,504
of the artificial gravity sensors.

120
00:04:27,504 --> 00:04:30,421
(soft eerie music)

121
00:04:34,626 --> 00:04:37,204
(rapid electronic beeping)

122
00:04:37,204 --> 00:04:38,037
(upbeat parlor music)

123
00:04:38,037 --> 00:04:41,310
- Ladies and gentlemen, please
you won't wanna miss this.

124
00:04:41,310 --> 00:04:44,060
We have a lot in store
for you on this trip,

125
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:46,750
like Virtual Reality

126
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:49,240
in the highest resolution available.

127
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:52,940
You can play nine holes
of virtual reality golf,

128
00:04:52,940 --> 00:04:57,230
you can swim in an Olympic
sized virtual reality pool

129
00:04:57,230 --> 00:05:02,230
and countless other VR
experiences from PG to X-rated.

130
00:05:03,047 --> 00:05:04,750
(laughing)

131
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:06,840
We have mood enhancers
in every size, shape

132
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:10,783
or feeling, which you can
purchase from Jack Hall.

133
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:14,820
- Your martini, Ms. Koros.

134
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:15,984
- It's about time.

135
00:05:15,984 --> 00:05:19,151
(upbeat parlor music)

136
00:05:20,444 --> 00:05:24,922
- [Man] Well, that asshole
said he was gonna kick my ass.

137
00:05:24,922 --> 00:05:26,505
That pissed me off.

138
00:05:27,733 --> 00:05:30,210
So I put around a rumor that uh.

139
00:05:30,210 --> 00:05:31,393
- [Koros] Warren Wayne.

140
00:05:32,610 --> 00:05:33,880
- [Man] I've been hypnotized.

141
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:34,713
- Do I know you?

142
00:05:35,690 --> 00:05:37,261
- [Koros] Not yet.

143
00:05:37,261 --> 00:05:38,360
- [Man] And that nobody could beat me.

144
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:40,720
- Anna Koros as in daughter

145
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,660
of Dmitri Koros, as in shipping.

146
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:43,750
- [Man] That was invincible.

147
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:45,690
- I saw you win Wimbledon.

148
00:05:45,690 --> 00:05:46,750
- Which time?

149
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:47,640
- Every time.

150
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:49,384
- [Man] Crowd cheering.

151
00:05:49,384 --> 00:05:50,900
- I never miss a Grand Slam event.

152
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:52,120
- [Man] Waving at him.

153
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:53,860
- You're the most exciting
player in the ATP.

154
00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:55,110
- [Man] And I just sat there.

155
00:05:55,110 --> 00:05:55,943
- Thanks.

156
00:05:55,943 --> 00:05:58,810
- Oh and Warren, just one more thing.

157
00:05:58,810 --> 00:06:00,450
- [Man] Towel over my head.

158
00:06:00,450 --> 00:06:03,640
- I want you to know I
have this an inexplicable

159
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:06,247
overwhelming urge to be naked with you.

160
00:06:06,247 --> 00:06:08,160
- [Man] And it freaked him out.

161
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,586
- Nice meeting you too.

162
00:06:09,586 --> 00:06:12,753
(upbeat parlor music)

163
00:06:27,746 --> 00:06:30,663
(knocking at door)

164
00:06:33,866 --> 00:06:35,116
- Hello, hello?

165
00:06:36,893 --> 00:06:37,726
Hello?

166
00:06:39,010 --> 00:06:42,000
- I'm sorry, miss this
is a restricted area.

167
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,030
- I'm Dawn Taggert,

168
00:06:44,030 --> 00:06:46,540
a visit to the bridge is part of my prize.

169
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:48,540
- Oh, yes the captain told me about you.

170
00:06:49,765 --> 00:06:52,515
(doors whirring)

171
00:06:56,589 --> 00:06:57,422
- Hello.

172
00:06:57,422 --> 00:06:58,255
- Hi.

173
00:07:01,410 --> 00:07:03,603
Is this your first trip to the moon?

174
00:07:04,630 --> 00:07:07,400
- This is my only trip
to the moon, I'm sure.

175
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:08,923
I'm an executive secretary.

176
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:12,870
I'd have to save up my whole
life for a trip like this.

177
00:07:15,050 --> 00:07:16,980
- What was the contest about anyway?

178
00:07:16,980 --> 00:07:19,420
- I named a Star Cruiser spacecraft.

179
00:07:19,420 --> 00:07:21,010
- What did you call it?

180
00:07:21,010 --> 00:07:22,600
- The Mercury Rising.

181
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:25,293
- Oh yeah, I get it after Mercury 3,

182
00:07:25,293 --> 00:07:27,490
the first spaceship that
took an American to space.

183
00:07:27,490 --> 00:07:29,243
- Alan Shepard May 6, 1961.

184
00:07:31,830 --> 00:07:32,730
- Please sit down.

185
00:07:33,940 --> 00:07:35,741
I'm first mate, Ryan Taylor

186
00:07:35,741 --> 00:07:37,580
and this is second mate, Alex Barnes.

187
00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:38,470
- Hi there.

188
00:07:38,470 --> 00:07:39,303
- Hi.

189
00:07:41,490 --> 00:07:43,060
Looking good.

190
00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:45,700
Your altitude vertical
velocity check-out normal

191
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:47,930
as does your acceleration velocity.

192
00:07:47,930 --> 00:07:49,630
Thrust indicators right on target.

193
00:07:53,350 --> 00:07:56,333
Oh, I pilot simulate flights
on my PC all the time.

194
00:08:03,394 --> 00:08:05,896
- Hi, how you doing, Vincent Miles.

195
00:08:05,896 --> 00:08:07,074
- Excuse me.

196
00:08:07,074 --> 00:08:09,074
- I'm setting up a casino on the moon.

197
00:08:09,074 --> 00:08:10,274
What a great idea, huh?

198
00:08:10,274 --> 00:08:11,896
I know you'll wanna get on board.

199
00:08:11,896 --> 00:08:13,254
It's gonna be big.

200
00:08:13,254 --> 00:08:14,087
We can't lose.

201
00:08:14,087 --> 00:08:16,136
Everybody wants a bit of this action.

202
00:08:16,136 --> 00:08:16,969
So.

203
00:08:16,969 --> 00:08:17,848
- [Woman] Go on.

204
00:08:17,848 --> 00:08:18,877
- [Man] Absolutely.

205
00:08:18,877 --> 00:08:21,689
- [Vincent] Here's my
card, give me a call.

206
00:08:21,689 --> 00:08:23,000
- But just, oh I gotta go.

207
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:23,833
Hi.

208
00:08:27,220 --> 00:08:29,887
- You weren't gonna get into
any trouble now were you?

209
00:08:29,887 --> 00:08:32,603
- Of course not, Vincent,
you worry too much.

210
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:36,260
Oh look, it's Tom Wilson.

211
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:39,060
He just made a killing when
electra-sharks bit him.

212
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:42,150
Why not chat him up
about our little casino?

213
00:08:42,150 --> 00:08:44,506
- Good instincts, Monica.

214
00:08:44,506 --> 00:08:47,506
(soft parlor music)

215
00:09:05,828 --> 00:09:08,911
(electronic beeping)

216
00:09:12,548 --> 00:09:16,048
(lighthearted jazz music)

217
00:09:20,484 --> 00:09:23,284
(static crackling)

218
00:09:23,284 --> 00:09:25,303
(panting)

219
00:09:25,303 --> 00:09:27,886
(man growling)

220
00:09:32,926 --> 00:09:35,259
(screaming)

221
00:09:36,828 --> 00:09:39,078
(grunting)

222
00:09:45,592 --> 00:09:47,759
(moaning)

223
00:09:48,627 --> 00:09:53,044
(grunting)
(moaning)

224
00:09:55,529 --> 00:09:58,691
(rapid electronic beeping)

225
00:09:58,691 --> 00:09:59,524
(soft parlor music)

226
00:09:59,524 --> 00:10:01,050
- You didn't fix Monica Miles up with

227
00:10:01,050 --> 00:10:02,060
a VR fantasy, did you?

228
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:03,343
- What of it?

229
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:07,630
- She's an addict, been
through detox and everything.

230
00:10:07,630 --> 00:10:09,337
- She's a big girl.

231
00:10:09,337 --> 00:10:11,800
You know, Jack, life would be more fun

232
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:13,120
if you changed your attitude.

233
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:15,913
- Too bad I wasn't born with
a smile on my face like you.

234
00:10:17,542 --> 00:10:19,004
- Try one of these,

235
00:10:19,004 --> 00:10:20,154
it'll fix you right up.

236
00:10:25,307 --> 00:10:26,167
(electronic beeping)

237
00:10:26,167 --> 00:10:27,334
- What's that?

238
00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:32,483
- What do you think, Barnes?

239
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:35,060
- It appears to be coming from

240
00:10:37,242 --> 00:10:38,075
a life pod menu.

241
00:10:40,370 --> 00:10:42,760
- I'm sorry, Dawn we're gonna
have to reschedule your visit.

242
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:44,463
- It's not serious, is it?

243
00:10:44,463 --> 00:10:46,970
- Absolutely not, we have so
many backups on this ship.

244
00:10:46,970 --> 00:10:48,850
We're covered no matter what.

245
00:10:49,863 --> 00:10:52,446
(low rumbling)

246
00:10:58,066 --> 00:11:01,233
(electronic whirring)

247
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:05,560
- And outside program has
been entered into our system.

248
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:07,470
- Hell, even if someone did
get into an unauthorized area

249
00:11:07,470 --> 00:11:09,690
the disk would be rejected
by the safeguards.

250
00:11:09,690 --> 00:11:11,740
- If hackers can infiltrate
the Pentagon, Taylor,

251
00:11:11,740 --> 00:11:14,370
they can infiltrate the Star Princess.

252
00:11:14,370 --> 00:11:15,630
Gibson, there you are.

253
00:11:15,630 --> 00:11:16,880
Go down to the life pod bay

254
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:19,630
and check on the status of
the pod releases, go now.

255
00:11:19,630 --> 00:11:20,463
- Yes, Captain.

256
00:11:21,630 --> 00:11:24,700
- Taylor, Barnes run a propulsion
control test on the pods.

257
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:26,940
I'll be working in the
main frame and engineering.

258
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:28,407
- Yes, Captain.

259
00:11:28,407 --> 00:11:31,157
(doors whirring)

260
00:11:32,828 --> 00:11:37,578
(indistinct crowd chatter in background)

261
00:11:45,541 --> 00:11:48,370
(static crackling)

262
00:11:48,370 --> 00:11:53,370
(tense music)
(heavy breathing)

263
00:12:11,415 --> 00:12:12,978
(groans)

264
00:12:12,978 --> 00:12:15,478
(tense music)

265
00:12:18,652 --> 00:12:20,902
(groaning)

266
00:12:25,803 --> 00:12:27,170
- Good evening,

267
00:12:27,170 --> 00:12:30,200
This is recording and
welcome to the Star Princess

268
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:31,930
interactive dining menu.

269
00:12:31,930 --> 00:12:34,130
Please enter your
selection for each window

270
00:12:34,130 --> 00:12:35,836
and enjoy your meal.

271
00:12:35,836 --> 00:12:39,003
(upbeat parlor music)

272
00:12:43,530 --> 00:12:44,810
- Yes, Captain Reynolds?

273
00:12:44,810 --> 00:12:47,910
- [Captain] Forget the propulsion
control system, Taylor.

274
00:12:47,910 --> 00:12:51,070
All of our life pods has
been programmed to eject.

275
00:12:51,070 --> 00:12:51,903
- What?

276
00:12:51,903 --> 00:12:55,440
- An outside command disk was
entered into the main frame

277
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:56,920
and I think it was Gibson.

278
00:12:56,920 --> 00:13:00,880
His key code was the last one
used to enter engineering,

279
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:04,470
but he wasn't authorized
to be in engineering.

280
00:13:04,470 --> 00:13:06,060
- Could he have been reprogrammed?

281
00:13:06,060 --> 00:13:08,100
- Wasn't Gibson supposed
to provide maintenance

282
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:09,990
on the artificial gravity sensors?

283
00:13:09,990 --> 00:13:11,040
- That's right Barnes.

284
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,840
Taylor, go check the sensors.

285
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:14,700
Barnes, do whatever it takes

286
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:17,580
to block the pod jettison command.

287
00:13:17,580 --> 00:13:20,180
I'm gonna find Gibson and
get to the bottom of this.

288
00:13:24,210 --> 00:13:26,990
- Wow, that was incredible.

289
00:13:26,990 --> 00:13:27,823
- May I?

290
00:13:29,090 --> 00:13:32,081
I understand VR is exhilarating.

291
00:13:32,081 --> 00:13:32,914
- You've never tried?

292
00:13:32,914 --> 00:13:34,060
Where how have you been?

293
00:13:34,060 --> 00:13:35,120
- Busy?

294
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:37,160
- Busy for like how long?

295
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:41,410
- This is my first vacation
for a very long time.

296
00:13:41,410 --> 00:13:43,567
- Don't you wanna know
what you're getting in to?

297
00:13:43,567 --> 00:13:46,203
(electronic beeping)

298
00:13:46,203 --> 00:13:49,264
(motorcycle engine revving)

299
00:13:49,264 --> 00:13:50,688
(static crackling)

300
00:13:50,688 --> 00:13:52,938
(cheering)

301
00:13:56,069 --> 00:13:57,365
(Barnes muttering)

302
00:13:57,365 --> 00:13:59,765
- Right there, yeah.

303
00:13:59,765 --> 00:14:00,940
Come on.

304
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:02,580
- Barnes, I need...

305
00:14:02,580 --> 00:14:04,450
That's an unauthorized piece of equipment.

306
00:14:04,450 --> 00:14:06,210
Where did it come from?

307
00:14:06,210 --> 00:14:07,473
- It's mine, Captain.

308
00:14:11,430 --> 00:14:12,263
- Yours?

309
00:14:15,119 --> 00:14:17,322
What the hell are you doing, Barnes?

310
00:14:17,322 --> 00:14:18,760
What's the meaning of that countdown?

311
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:21,730
- Oh, I can't tell you that.

312
00:14:21,730 --> 00:14:24,581
- Barnes, step away from the laptop.

313
00:14:24,581 --> 00:14:27,824
(tense drum music)
(electronic beeping)

314
00:14:27,824 --> 00:14:29,419
(laser blasts)

315
00:14:29,419 --> 00:14:31,669
(groaning)

316
00:14:33,917 --> 00:14:35,584
- You lose, Captain.

317
00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:40,400
Three, two, one.

318
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:41,420
(rapid beeping)

319
00:14:41,420 --> 00:14:42,267
Blast off.

320
00:14:43,775 --> 00:14:48,692
(explosions)
(tense music)

321
00:14:51,142 --> 00:14:56,142
(people screaming)
(objects clattering)

322
00:15:02,116 --> 00:15:04,738
(explosion)

323
00:15:04,738 --> 00:15:07,405
(alarm blaring)

324
00:15:10,476 --> 00:15:13,393
(people screaming)

325
00:15:14,359 --> 00:15:17,418
(grunting)

326
00:15:17,418 --> 00:15:18,551
(explosions)

327
00:15:18,551 --> 00:15:20,969
(screaming)

328
00:15:20,969 --> 00:15:23,327
(alarm blaring)

329
00:15:23,327 --> 00:15:28,160
(tense music)
(screaming)

330
00:15:35,417 --> 00:15:36,616
(shouting)

331
00:15:36,616 --> 00:15:37,533
- No, stop!

332
00:15:39,288 --> 00:15:41,621
(screaming)

333
00:15:44,690 --> 00:15:46,328
- Dawn!

334
00:15:46,328 --> 00:15:48,828
(tense music)

335
00:15:50,349 --> 00:15:53,016
(alarm blaring)

336
00:15:54,973 --> 00:15:56,050
(electricity crackling)

337
00:15:56,050 --> 00:15:58,558
(screaming)

338
00:15:58,558 --> 00:16:00,225
- Wait, wait for me.

339
00:16:01,224 --> 00:16:03,064
Barnes, Trina!

340
00:16:03,064 --> 00:16:05,464
(coughing)

341
00:16:05,464 --> 00:16:06,605
Anybody!

342
00:16:06,605 --> 00:16:08,158
(tense music)

343
00:16:08,158 --> 00:16:10,825
(alarm blaring)

344
00:16:12,424 --> 00:16:15,757
(electricity crackling)

345
00:16:48,297 --> 00:16:50,880
(man coughing)

346
00:17:03,038 --> 00:17:08,038
(groaning)
(debris clattering)

347
00:17:09,390 --> 00:17:10,670
- [Taylor] You okay?

348
00:17:10,670 --> 00:17:13,091
- [Dawn] I don't know, I think so.

349
00:17:13,091 --> 00:17:14,510
- Okay.

350
00:17:14,510 --> 00:17:16,720
(man groaning)

351
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:18,220
Stay here, I'll be right back.

352
00:17:21,763 --> 00:17:22,763
- Mr Putnam.

353
00:17:23,747 --> 00:17:28,747
(gurgling)
(heavy breathing)

354
00:17:29,110 --> 00:17:31,193
Mr Putnam, are you all right?

355
00:17:32,270 --> 00:17:35,320
- That wasn't virtual reality, was it?

356
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:37,107
- No, I'm afraid not.

357
00:17:37,107 --> 00:17:38,863
(groaning)

358
00:17:38,863 --> 00:17:40,178
(gurgling)

359
00:17:40,178 --> 00:17:42,225
You're injured.

360
00:17:42,225 --> 00:17:43,058
(grunting)

361
00:17:43,058 --> 00:17:45,975
(metal clattering)

362
00:17:52,321 --> 00:17:55,143
- [Monica] Vincent, where are you?

363
00:17:55,143 --> 00:17:56,726
- [Vincent] Monica?

364
00:18:07,127 --> 00:18:08,877
- Vincent, thank God.

365
00:18:20,862 --> 00:18:23,388
(body thudding)

366
00:18:23,388 --> 00:18:25,238
- What in the God damn hell was that?

367
00:18:43,228 --> 00:18:44,978
- Can I have a drink?

368
00:18:46,970 --> 00:18:47,803
- Be my guest.

369
00:18:48,704 --> 00:18:50,608
(upbeat parlor music)

370
00:18:50,608 --> 00:18:53,525
(glass clattering)

371
00:19:01,730 --> 00:19:03,960
- Jack, what happened?

372
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:05,332
What's going on?

373
00:19:05,332 --> 00:19:06,827
- I don't know, some sort of accident.

374
00:19:06,827 --> 00:19:08,570
- Are we gonna die, Jack?

375
00:19:08,570 --> 00:19:11,070
- Oh, for God's sake, man,
pull yourself together.

376
00:19:12,270 --> 00:19:14,950
Here, take one of these.

377
00:19:14,950 --> 00:19:16,303
It'll fix you right up.

378
00:19:17,353 --> 00:19:20,186
(soft jazz music)

379
00:19:24,020 --> 00:19:25,630
- This is Taylor to bridge.

380
00:19:25,630 --> 00:19:26,980
Bridge, can you read me?

381
00:19:26,980 --> 00:19:29,180
- You weren't supposed to
destroy this ship Gibson.

382
00:19:29,180 --> 00:19:31,030
We saved that for later.

383
00:19:31,030 --> 00:19:32,930
How come you went ape with the shockwave?

384
00:19:32,930 --> 00:19:34,960
You better start talking, android.

385
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:36,230
- You altered my directives.

386
00:19:36,230 --> 00:19:37,530
Perhaps you errored when you overrode

387
00:19:37,530 --> 00:19:39,339
my human sanctity programming.

388
00:19:39,339 --> 00:19:42,600
- What is this, some kind
of fucking android revenge?

389
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:44,063
You think you're human now?

390
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:46,953
You're not!

391
00:19:48,260 --> 00:19:51,303
I can deactivate you anytime I want to.

392
00:19:53,140 --> 00:19:54,440
- Bridge, can you read me?

393
00:19:55,690 --> 00:19:57,573
Barnes, do you read me do you copy?

394
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:00,803
Engineering, Captain?

395
00:20:02,841 --> 00:20:03,939
- You better hope there
are some survivors,

396
00:20:03,939 --> 00:20:04,772
left on this ship
- Barnes, anybody.

397
00:20:04,772 --> 00:20:06,440
This is Taylor.

398
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:07,853
- Some very rich ones.

399
00:20:08,780 --> 00:20:09,810
- Do you copy Bridge?

400
00:20:09,810 --> 00:20:10,690
Taylor to Bridge.

401
00:20:10,690 --> 00:20:12,460
Does anybody read me?

402
00:20:12,460 --> 00:20:14,270
- I copy, Taylor.

403
00:20:14,270 --> 00:20:16,700
- Barnes, you made it that's great.

404
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:17,850
What about the captain?

405
00:20:19,990 --> 00:20:20,823
- No.

406
00:20:24,950 --> 00:20:25,783
- Look, Barnes,

407
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:28,160
you have to send the code three emergency

408
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:29,570
we don't have a lot of time,

409
00:20:29,570 --> 00:20:31,713
we got to make it to the life pods.

410
00:20:32,780 --> 00:20:34,460
- I can't do that, Taylor.

411
00:20:34,460 --> 00:20:35,460
- [Taylor] Why?

412
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:37,470
Is the transmitter damaged?

413
00:20:37,470 --> 00:20:38,890
- No.

414
00:20:38,890 --> 00:20:40,560
- Then send the code three now.

415
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:42,383
- I said no!

416
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:45,510
- Would you come to your senses, man?

417
00:20:45,510 --> 00:20:49,040
- All right now, listen to me, all of you.

418
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:51,900
I'm willing to transmit
a code three emergency

419
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:55,793
If all of you are willing
to co-operate with me.

420
00:20:55,793 --> 00:20:57,530
(eerie tense music)

421
00:20:57,530 --> 00:21:02,380
This ship has another 36
hours of life support,

422
00:21:02,380 --> 00:21:05,333
just enough to let the
rescue team get here in time.

423
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:08,123
If you're lucky.

424
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:11,830
- You're the one that sabotaged the ship?

425
00:21:11,830 --> 00:21:13,370
- Earth to Taylor.

426
00:21:13,370 --> 00:21:14,203
Hello!

427
00:21:15,430 --> 00:21:19,030
This ship is history.

428
00:21:19,030 --> 00:21:20,140
- What do you want?

429
00:21:20,140 --> 00:21:21,613
- Isn't it obvious Taylor?

430
00:21:22,860 --> 00:21:24,240
He wants money.

431
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:26,600
- Oh, you catch on quickly, Mr. Miles.

432
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:29,630
All this hard work you've
been doing is paying off.

433
00:21:29,630 --> 00:21:32,260
I think you have finally found investors

434
00:21:32,260 --> 00:21:34,713
for your big bank casino in the sky.

435
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:39,020
- I'm not investing in
any space colony casino.

436
00:21:39,020 --> 00:21:43,440
- Yes you are, all of you.

437
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:45,610
- But I only have a $1,000 in my account.

438
00:21:45,610 --> 00:21:47,223
- Not you, dimwit!

439
00:21:47,223 --> 00:21:49,980
I'm only interested in people
with my kind of capital.

440
00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:50,930
- I am not a dimwit

441
00:21:51,964 --> 00:21:53,870
and you're a murderer and a thief.

442
00:21:53,870 --> 00:21:55,020
- Don't antagonize him.

443
00:21:57,164 --> 00:21:59,863
- And you're dead, all of you.

444
00:22:02,130 --> 00:22:03,860
Unless you co-operate.

445
00:22:03,860 --> 00:22:08,853
You have 30 minutes to give
me those transfer codes.

446
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:16,653
- I'm not giving him a goddamn thing.

447
00:22:17,687 --> 00:22:22,687
Not a password, not an access
code, not a transfer code.

448
00:22:22,870 --> 00:22:25,253
He can kiss my $11 billion ass.

449
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:29,740
- You have to give him the codes.

450
00:22:29,740 --> 00:22:32,120
Barnes will kill us if you don't.

451
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:35,023
Look around lady, there
are dead people here.

452
00:22:35,023 --> 00:22:37,450
- Look everybody, can
we just calm down, okay?

453
00:22:37,450 --> 00:22:39,750
Can everybody just take it easy?

454
00:22:39,750 --> 00:22:41,250
We've got 30 minutes.

455
00:22:41,250 --> 00:22:43,130
If we can get down to the life pods

456
00:22:43,130 --> 00:22:46,280
we might not need to send
the code three emergency.

457
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:48,290
- Then get us out of here.

458
00:22:48,290 --> 00:22:49,640
- I'm doing the best I can.

459
00:22:55,380 --> 00:22:56,729
- Mac?

460
00:22:56,729 --> 00:22:57,729
- Mac.
- Mac.

461
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:04,010
- On behalf of the Star Princess

462
00:23:04,010 --> 00:23:06,300
I would like to apologize
for any inconvenience

463
00:23:06,300 --> 00:23:08,180
this may have caused you.

464
00:23:08,180 --> 00:23:09,410
I'm sensing a high level

465
00:23:09,410 --> 00:23:12,070
of negative feedback from our guests.

466
00:23:12,070 --> 00:23:14,780
- Oh Mac, you're my favorite android.

467
00:23:14,780 --> 00:23:15,840
- I got it.

468
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:16,810
Mac.

469
00:23:16,810 --> 00:23:20,210
- We have fabulous cuisine
available 24 hours a day

470
00:23:20,210 --> 00:23:21,300
in the Earth rise room.

471
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:22,600
- Yes, I know, I know.

472
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:24,880
Look, I need your help to
interface with the mainframe

473
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:26,922
so I can check the ship's condition.

474
00:23:26,922 --> 00:23:27,860
(rapid beeping)

475
00:23:27,860 --> 00:23:30,130
- Alteration of my central processing unit

476
00:23:30,130 --> 00:23:33,450
should be performed only by
an authorized service dealer.

477
00:23:33,450 --> 00:23:34,860
- Forget the service dealer.

478
00:23:34,860 --> 00:23:35,910
As first mate of the ship

479
00:23:35,910 --> 00:23:39,153
I authorize you to alter
your central processing.

480
00:23:39,153 --> 00:23:40,300
(rapid beeping)

481
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:42,490
- Alteration of my central processing unit

482
00:23:42,490 --> 00:23:45,653
should be performed only by
an authorized service dealer.

483
00:23:49,190 --> 00:23:51,923
- Yes Mac but the guests
are requesting it,

484
00:23:52,973 --> 00:23:56,092
it would reduce the level
of negative feedback.

485
00:23:56,092 --> 00:23:58,970
(rapid beeping)

486
00:23:58,970 --> 00:24:00,583
- This is one of my priorities.

487
00:24:03,420 --> 00:24:04,849
- Yes.

488
00:24:04,849 --> 00:24:08,349
(lighthearted horn music)

489
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:11,920
- Care to dance, mon capitan?

490
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:12,960
No?

491
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:13,833
What a bore.

492
00:24:15,580 --> 00:24:17,111
Two, three.

493
00:24:17,111 --> 00:24:17,944
Cha-cha-cha.

494
00:24:17,944 --> 00:24:18,831
Two, three.

495
00:24:18,831 --> 00:24:19,664
Cha-cha-cha.

496
00:24:19,664 --> 00:24:20,631
Hey Gibson, you cha-cha?

497
00:24:20,631 --> 00:24:23,670
- Barnes, Barnes?

498
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:27,853
- It's about time, Katz.

499
00:24:29,183 --> 00:24:30,420
You know how to shark the biz.

500
00:24:30,420 --> 00:24:32,280
- I've got cargo to haul.

501
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:33,530
How did it go?

502
00:24:33,530 --> 00:24:35,890
- Gibson went rabid during the shockwave

503
00:24:35,890 --> 00:24:38,053
so we're down to four billionaires.

504
00:24:38,970 --> 00:24:41,030
- How the hell did that happen?

505
00:24:41,030 --> 00:24:42,210
You created him.

506
00:24:42,210 --> 00:24:43,500
- I didn't create him, genius,

507
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:45,520
I circumvented his program

508
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:47,220
and if you're displeased with the results,

509
00:24:47,220 --> 00:24:48,840
you can bail now.

510
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:50,910
- Screw you, Barnes.

511
00:24:50,910 --> 00:24:52,870
I'm your ticket to ride

512
00:24:52,870 --> 00:24:56,210
unless you want the Feds
crawling down your ass.

513
00:24:56,210 --> 00:24:58,300
- I'll take my chances.

514
00:24:58,300 --> 00:24:59,693
How bout you for a ball?

515
00:25:00,711 --> 00:25:03,970
- Okay, how much can we get?

516
00:25:03,970 --> 00:25:06,780
- We still have Koros,
Miles, Wayne and Putnam

517
00:25:06,780 --> 00:25:08,740
do the arithmetic.

518
00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:10,890
- Okay, but don't drag your
ass there won't be much

519
00:25:10,890 --> 00:25:12,490
of a window for us to link up.

520
00:25:12,490 --> 00:25:15,000
I'll be in your orbit trajectory
in less than two hours.

521
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:15,930
- Yes, I know it, Katz.

522
00:25:15,930 --> 00:25:17,350
I devised the plan remember?

523
00:25:17,350 --> 00:25:20,930
You just have those hangar
doors open and ready.

524
00:25:20,930 --> 00:25:24,683
There's one life pod left,
and guess who gets it.

525
00:25:26,780 --> 00:25:27,613
Whatever.

526
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:31,850
Well, Frankenstein.

527
00:25:31,850 --> 00:25:33,450
It looks like we're in business.

528
00:25:34,504 --> 00:25:39,504
(lighthearted music)
(rapid beeping)

529
00:25:46,460 --> 00:25:47,293
- Okay, Mac.

530
00:25:48,410 --> 00:25:50,343
I gotta access your CPU directly.

531
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:54,993
- One moment please.

532
00:25:57,140 --> 00:25:58,850
One moment please.

533
00:25:58,850 --> 00:26:00,950
- For Christ sake, Mac,
can you help us or not.

534
00:26:00,950 --> 00:26:04,650
- Artificial gravity and
atmosphere remain at 100%

535
00:26:04,650 --> 00:26:06,730
in the corridor outside the lounge.

536
00:26:06,730 --> 00:26:08,500
Other corridors have sustained

537
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:10,610
significant structural damage.

538
00:26:10,610 --> 00:26:14,960
Some provide atmosphere, others do not.

539
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:17,260
We are experiencing technical difficulties

540
00:26:17,260 --> 00:26:19,730
with all exits on this level.

541
00:26:19,730 --> 00:26:22,230
We apologize for this inconvenience.

542
00:26:22,230 --> 00:26:25,180
- But the corridor right
outside here is usable right?

543
00:26:25,180 --> 00:26:26,013
- Yes.

544
00:26:26,900 --> 00:26:28,603
- Can you check the life pod bay?

545
00:26:32,634 --> 00:26:35,883
- There is one life pod
available for our passengers.

546
00:26:44,056 --> 00:26:47,139
(lighthearted music)

547
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:51,050
- Gibson, you really fixed this up.

548
00:26:51,050 --> 00:26:52,810
I can't make a link up with West Star

549
00:26:52,810 --> 00:26:55,220
to call Vincent's business
partner in the states.

550
00:26:55,220 --> 00:26:58,270
- Try Palata, one of the
Indonesian satellites.

551
00:26:58,270 --> 00:27:01,230
- Yeah, good thinking,
the orbit near the poles.

552
00:27:01,230 --> 00:27:02,824
- The equator.

553
00:27:02,824 --> 00:27:05,907
(lighthearted music)

554
00:27:07,590 --> 00:27:10,110
- Couldn't we make it
to the life pod first?

555
00:27:10,110 --> 00:27:13,380
- Even if we could it only
has a maximum capacity

556
00:27:13,380 --> 00:27:15,005
for seven adults.

557
00:27:15,005 --> 00:27:17,370
- Then we'll just have to get
to know each other real well.

558
00:27:17,370 --> 00:27:18,630
- I'm afraid it's not that simple.

559
00:27:18,630 --> 00:27:23,450
You see it only has so
much oxygen, so much fuel,

560
00:27:23,450 --> 00:27:26,390
so much mass it can carry on re-entry.

561
00:27:26,390 --> 00:27:29,610
- Well, in that case, paying
customers have first dibs.

562
00:27:29,610 --> 00:27:31,460
- Lady, you can't be serious.

563
00:27:31,460 --> 00:27:33,330
- The customer always comes first.

564
00:27:33,330 --> 00:27:36,143
- Lady I will throw you out
before I let you take my seat.

565
00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:41,840
- I am prepared to give up
my place on the life pod.

566
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:43,290
- What are you talking about?

567
00:27:44,750 --> 00:27:48,193
- I am an old man, I've lived a full life.

568
00:27:50,140 --> 00:27:52,803
The rest of you have
your lives ahead of you.

569
00:27:54,050 --> 00:27:55,480
- He's right.

570
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:58,970
I mean the party is almost
over for him, anyway.

571
00:27:58,970 --> 00:28:00,993
I think we should take
him up on his offer.

572
00:28:02,540 --> 00:28:04,230
- Thank you Mr. Putnam

573
00:28:04,230 --> 00:28:08,530
but I refuse to put a value on
a man's life based on his age

574
00:28:09,820 --> 00:28:11,820
or his character as much as I'd like to.

575
00:28:13,657 --> 00:28:15,400
- Will you stop?

576
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:16,700
We're running out of time.

577
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:24,803
- If I can get to the bridge,
I could send a signal myself.

578
00:28:25,890 --> 00:28:29,383
- You can't go out there it's suicide.

579
00:28:32,590 --> 00:28:33,680
- Not necessarily.

580
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:34,780
Hey, Mac.

581
00:28:34,780 --> 00:28:38,080
Is there any way for me to
access the space suit hold?

582
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:40,870
- I'm sorry, artificial
gravity and atmosphere

583
00:28:40,870 --> 00:28:42,650
have been lost in the suit hold.

584
00:28:42,650 --> 00:28:44,653
I'm afraid is off limits for humans.

585
00:28:46,030 --> 00:28:48,333
- Wait, can you go there
and bring one back?

586
00:28:50,877 --> 00:28:53,960
(lighthearted music)

587
00:28:54,810 --> 00:28:56,660
- It is my pleasure to be of service.

588
00:28:58,255 --> 00:29:01,838
(lighthearted tense music)

589
00:29:40,130 --> 00:29:42,240
- [Taylor] Mac, did you get the suit?

590
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:43,563
- Yes, first mate Taylor.

591
00:29:44,781 --> 00:29:46,538
- [Man] Thank god.

592
00:29:46,538 --> 00:29:48,057
- That's great.

593
00:29:48,057 --> 00:29:50,723
(tense music)

594
00:29:50,723 --> 00:29:54,056
(electricity crackling)

595
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:56,793
Mac?

596
00:29:58,270 --> 00:29:59,843
Mac is everything all right?

597
00:29:59,843 --> 00:30:04,843
(electricity crackling)
(Mac shouting)

598
00:30:05,863 --> 00:30:06,750
- (warbled electronic
voice) We have experienced

599
00:30:06,750 --> 00:30:07,940
a critical error.

600
00:30:07,940 --> 00:30:09,363
- Mac, can you hear me?

601
00:30:10,845 --> 00:30:11,678
- (warbled electronic voice) I will review

602
00:30:11,678 --> 00:30:12,823
my previous commands.

603
00:30:16,820 --> 00:30:19,000
Bridge your way to the suit.

604
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,110
Hold, hold.

605
00:30:21,110 --> 00:30:24,620
The compartment, ment, the the bridge.

606
00:30:24,620 --> 00:30:27,193
My name is Bu-Buddy buddy.

607
00:30:31,020 --> 00:30:32,080
- It shorted out.

608
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:33,580
What else could have happened?

609
00:30:35,010 --> 00:30:36,160
- Mac, can you hear me?

610
00:30:37,230 --> 00:30:38,063
- Mac?

611
00:30:38,995 --> 00:30:41,662
(door whirring)

612
00:30:43,630 --> 00:30:44,463
- Mac?

613
00:30:45,370 --> 00:30:47,123
You're looking a little frazzled.

614
00:30:47,123 --> 00:30:47,956
(Gibson laughs)

615
00:30:47,956 --> 00:30:49,280
Shut up.

616
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:50,730
- Good evening.

617
00:30:50,730 --> 00:30:53,550
I've been instructed to
report to the bridge.

618
00:30:53,550 --> 00:30:54,383
- You have?

619
00:30:55,910 --> 00:30:57,760
- Is there anything I can do for you?

620
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:02,260
- Yeah, sure, Mac.

621
00:31:02,260 --> 00:31:03,730
Come on in.

622
00:31:03,730 --> 00:31:05,500
- Mac, can you hear me?

623
00:31:05,500 --> 00:31:06,360
Mac!

624
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:07,930
- How did you get here?

625
00:31:07,930 --> 00:31:11,393
I mean the ship isn't
exactly in primo condition.

626
00:31:14,750 --> 00:31:18,210
- I passed through
several restricted areas.

627
00:31:18,210 --> 00:31:21,230
I am sensing a high level of
passenger dissatisfaction,

628
00:31:21,230 --> 00:31:23,510
which it is my duty to report.

629
00:31:23,510 --> 00:31:26,297
- And did officer Taylor
wants you to check

630
00:31:26,297 --> 00:31:27,640
on this passenger dissatisfaction?

631
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:29,920
- Officer Taylor accessed my CPU directly

632
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:32,230
to open the air lock doors.

633
00:31:32,230 --> 00:31:33,063
- Did he?

634
00:31:37,850 --> 00:31:40,016
- Mac, what's going on?

635
00:31:40,016 --> 00:31:40,849
- [Dawn] Mac?

636
00:31:40,849 --> 00:31:41,720
- [Taylor] Mac, can you here me?

637
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:46,720
- And were you communicating
with officer Taylor using this?

638
00:31:47,170 --> 00:31:50,400
- Yes, the device has stopped responding.

639
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:52,020
- Oh well gee, here

640
00:31:52,020 --> 00:31:53,463
let me fix it for you Mac.

641
00:31:58,560 --> 00:31:59,393
- Mac?

642
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:02,150
Mac, are you there?

643
00:32:02,150 --> 00:32:04,543
- Not Mac, me, Taylor.

644
00:32:05,610 --> 00:32:08,980
Never send an android to do a man's work.

645
00:32:08,980 --> 00:32:10,070
But I gotta tell you, Taylor,

646
00:32:10,070 --> 00:32:11,520
I am very impressed.

647
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:15,263
Sending Mac, that took some
very creative thinking.

648
00:32:16,590 --> 00:32:17,680
But get this first mate,

649
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:20,543
if anything like this ever happens again,

650
00:32:22,540 --> 00:32:23,730
you can forget about my sending

651
00:32:23,730 --> 00:32:25,333
that code three distress signal.

652
00:32:26,459 --> 00:32:28,959
(tense music)

653
00:32:33,170 --> 00:32:36,220
Well, you certainly have earned
your wings on this one, Mac.

654
00:32:36,220 --> 00:32:37,810
- My wings?

655
00:32:37,810 --> 00:32:38,653
- That's right,

656
00:32:40,510 --> 00:32:41,453
your wings.

657
00:32:42,900 --> 00:32:45,810
- I am here to provide
service to to all our guests,

658
00:32:45,810 --> 00:32:47,030
it is my duty.

659
00:32:47,030 --> 00:32:48,013
- I hear you Mac.

660
00:32:49,420 --> 00:32:51,190
You're gonna go far in this business.

661
00:32:51,190 --> 00:32:52,023
After you.

662
00:32:53,140 --> 00:32:55,483
Hey, thanks for all your help.

663
00:32:57,450 --> 00:33:00,076
(alarm blaring)

664
00:33:00,076 --> 00:33:02,326
(laughing)

665
00:33:08,914 --> 00:33:10,572
I can't believe it.

666
00:33:10,572 --> 00:33:12,822
(laughing)

667
00:33:18,370 --> 00:33:20,631
- Taylor, I really
appreciate what you're trying

668
00:33:20,631 --> 00:33:22,214
to do for everyone.

669
00:33:23,589 --> 00:33:24,422
- Thanks.

670
00:33:25,890 --> 00:33:27,900
- The Star Princess cruise in the sky

671
00:33:27,900 --> 00:33:31,234
proudly continues it's
on air entertainment.

672
00:33:31,234 --> 00:33:32,160
(mimics buzzer)

673
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:33,768
Time's up folks.

674
00:33:33,768 --> 00:33:37,093
All right, all of you listen to me.

675
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:41,070
I'm sending Gibson down for Vincent Miles.

676
00:33:41,070 --> 00:33:42,360
- Gibson?

677
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:45,170
So I guess your computer
skills didn't go to waste.

678
00:33:45,170 --> 00:33:47,570
- Success means seizing the opportunity

679
00:33:47,570 --> 00:33:49,190
when it arises, Taylor.

680
00:33:49,190 --> 00:33:52,220
- Reprogramming an android
to take action against humans

681
00:33:52,220 --> 00:33:53,360
is not an opportunity,

682
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:55,690
it's a crime against humanity.

683
00:33:55,690 --> 00:33:57,460
- Taylor, you're boring me.

684
00:33:57,460 --> 00:34:00,110
- Mr. Barnes, will give
Gibson the transfer codes.

685
00:34:00,110 --> 00:34:02,490
There's no need for my
husband to deliver them.

686
00:34:02,490 --> 00:34:04,920
- Monica, Monica, Monica,
stick to your fantasies

687
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:08,913
'cause babe, reality doesn't
come easy for you, does it?

688
00:34:11,460 --> 00:34:12,293
- Hey Barnes.

689
00:34:13,130 --> 00:34:14,994
I'm telling you, Barnes.

690
00:34:14,994 --> 00:34:18,990
If you don't keep to your
word and send the code three

691
00:34:18,990 --> 00:34:20,433
I'm coming after you myself.

692
00:34:23,808 --> 00:34:26,058
(laughing)

693
00:34:30,121 --> 00:34:31,871
- Gibson, go get him.

694
00:34:40,636 --> 00:34:43,553
(soft tense music)

695
00:34:50,550 --> 00:34:51,683
- Don't go Vincent.

696
00:34:54,267 --> 00:34:55,100
Don't go.

697
00:34:57,371 --> 00:34:58,204
Please.

698
00:34:59,921 --> 00:35:01,254
Please don't go.

699
00:35:08,650 --> 00:35:09,703
- I have no choice.

700
00:35:11,095 --> 00:35:13,928
(woman screaming)

701
00:35:15,635 --> 00:35:17,885
(groaning)

702
00:35:23,135 --> 00:35:25,885
(bones snapping)

703
00:35:48,726 --> 00:35:51,530
- I don't know how much
you know about me, Gibson

704
00:35:51,530 --> 00:35:54,080
but I have a reputation for
being a generous employer

705
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:55,990
who promotes from within.

706
00:35:55,990 --> 00:35:57,870
How would you like to work for me?

707
00:35:57,870 --> 00:35:59,560
You can run my casino.

708
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:01,560
Be a step up from the Star Princess.

709
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:03,720
an amazing opportunity for an android.

710
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:05,863
- Don't patronize me, Mr. Miles.

711
00:36:08,950 --> 00:36:10,993
There's no job for me at your casino.

712
00:36:16,060 --> 00:36:17,010
- Ah, Mr. Vincent.

713
00:36:17,010 --> 00:36:17,990
Welcome, welcome, welcome.

714
00:36:17,990 --> 00:36:19,050
You got something for me there?

715
00:36:19,050 --> 00:36:20,728
Thank you, Gibson.

716
00:36:20,728 --> 00:36:21,728
Pop this in.

717
00:36:23,740 --> 00:36:26,260
So, have you ever been
up to the bridge before?

718
00:36:26,260 --> 00:36:29,470
It's not as complicated as
it looks here have a seat.

719
00:36:29,470 --> 00:36:31,380
(upbeat parlor music)

720
00:36:31,380 --> 00:36:35,070
- Uppers and downers, uppers and downers.

721
00:36:35,070 --> 00:36:36,340
Uppers and downers...

722
00:36:36,340 --> 00:36:39,486
Somehow, I don't think
she's bungee jumping.

723
00:36:39,486 --> 00:36:42,319
(soft jazz music)

724
00:36:50,739 --> 00:36:53,572
(birds squawking)

725
00:37:04,889 --> 00:37:07,139
(grunting)

726
00:37:09,555 --> 00:37:12,388
(soft jazz music)

727
00:37:48,616 --> 00:37:50,153
(electronic hissing)

728
00:37:50,153 --> 00:37:53,070
(static crackling)

729
00:37:54,722 --> 00:37:56,584
(screaming)

730
00:37:56,584 --> 00:37:59,251
- Nice talking to you, too lady.

731
00:38:01,144 --> 00:38:02,067
(upbeat parlor music)

732
00:38:02,067 --> 00:38:03,540
- Uppers and downers.

733
00:38:03,540 --> 00:38:04,903
Uppers and downers.

734
00:38:06,010 --> 00:38:07,290
How about you, Mr. Putnam,

735
00:38:07,290 --> 00:38:09,090
feel like a little adventure?

736
00:38:09,090 --> 00:38:10,640
It's on the house.

737
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:11,760
- No, thank you.

738
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:14,400
I've already had all the
adventure I need for one day.

739
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:16,180
- What do you saying, Monica?

740
00:38:16,180 --> 00:38:17,850
- No.
- Oh, come on.

741
00:38:17,850 --> 00:38:18,683
- Maybe later.

742
00:38:19,870 --> 00:38:21,460
- Monica, there's no need to fight it,

743
00:38:21,460 --> 00:38:22,610
You know you love it.

744
00:38:22,610 --> 00:38:23,811
Come on.

745
00:38:23,811 --> 00:38:25,572
- Get away from me!

746
00:38:25,572 --> 00:38:28,489
(glass shattering)

747
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:32,206
- What the hell is wrong with you, huh?

748
00:38:32,206 --> 00:38:33,039
Huh!

749
00:38:34,690 --> 00:38:36,530
What's the matter with you people?

750
00:38:36,530 --> 00:38:37,570
Are you so damn hedonistic

751
00:38:37,570 --> 00:38:38,950
that you don't realize we're probably

752
00:38:38,950 --> 00:38:40,593
gonna die in this room?

753
00:38:41,540 --> 00:38:43,900
Is this the life of the idle rich?

754
00:38:43,900 --> 00:38:46,230
- Can't blame us wanting to escape.

755
00:38:46,230 --> 00:38:47,420
- Escape huh?

756
00:38:47,420 --> 00:38:48,851
Escape.

757
00:38:48,851 --> 00:38:50,115
You wanna escape like this?

758
00:38:50,115 --> 00:38:52,523
Or you wanna try to get
out of this room alive?

759
00:38:54,070 --> 00:38:56,330
- Good news, Phillips, I got 'em.

760
00:38:56,330 --> 00:38:58,867
I landed the investors
we were looking for.

761
00:38:58,867 --> 00:39:00,020
- Fantastic.

762
00:39:00,020 --> 00:39:00,890
Who did you get?

763
00:39:00,890 --> 00:39:02,890
- Do the names Koros, Wayne and Putnam

764
00:39:02,890 --> 00:39:04,140
mean anything to you?

765
00:39:04,140 --> 00:39:05,213
- Anna Koros?

766
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:08,550
She can bankroll the entire project.

767
00:39:08,550 --> 00:39:09,500
- [Miles] Phillips?

768
00:39:13,230 --> 00:39:14,063
- What is it?

769
00:39:21,190 --> 00:39:22,090
- Congratulations.

770
00:39:25,100 --> 00:39:26,023
- Likewise, bro.

771
00:39:29,494 --> 00:39:30,994
- How does it feel to be rich?

772
00:39:33,470 --> 00:39:35,307
If only for the blink of an eye.

773
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:39,480
(eerie tense music)

774
00:39:41,500 --> 00:39:45,500
Now we only have one little
matter left, Vincent.

775
00:39:45,500 --> 00:39:48,063
The development account access code.

776
00:39:51,558 --> 00:39:54,558
(eerie tense music)

777
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:01,290
The access code Miles, now!

778
00:40:05,163 --> 00:40:05,996
- 4-80.

779
00:40:10,937 --> 00:40:14,003
9-6-3-2.

780
00:40:18,246 --> 00:40:19,440
(laser blast)

781
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:21,840
(wet squelching)

782
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:23,090
- Thanks for cooperating.

783
00:40:29,132 --> 00:40:31,465
(chuckling)

784
00:40:40,930 --> 00:40:42,560
- Okay, listen up everybody.

785
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:44,233
I'm going to the space suit hold.

786
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:47,050
I need somebody to come with me.

787
00:40:47,050 --> 00:40:48,750
I'm not gonna minimize the danger.

788
00:40:49,830 --> 00:40:50,663
Jack?

789
00:40:56,070 --> 00:40:57,150
Warren?

790
00:40:57,150 --> 00:40:59,863
- Sorry dude, my specialty is my serve.

791
00:41:03,500 --> 00:41:04,890
- Carlo?

792
00:41:04,890 --> 00:41:07,130
- This is the wrong approach.

793
00:41:07,130 --> 00:41:09,777
You've gotta reason
with a man like Barnes.

794
00:41:09,777 --> 00:41:11,137
- [Taylor] You can't
reason with a mad man.

795
00:41:11,137 --> 00:41:12,417
- You can if you know how.

796
00:41:12,417 --> 00:41:14,257
Let me talk to him.

797
00:41:14,257 --> 00:41:16,490
- [Taylor] You're just
gonna make things worse.

798
00:41:16,490 --> 00:41:17,603
- Get lost, Taylor.

799
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:20,960
Who's with me?

800
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:22,633
Who wants me to talk to Barnes?

801
00:41:30,340 --> 00:41:31,173
Bunch of losers.

802
00:41:34,780 --> 00:41:36,230
- I'll come with you, Taylor.

803
00:41:37,900 --> 00:41:38,990
- I can't take you.

804
00:41:38,990 --> 00:41:40,190
- Look, I know as much about this ship

805
00:41:40,190 --> 00:41:42,393
as any of these men do probably more.

806
00:41:43,430 --> 00:41:45,853
Please, let me help you, Taylor.

807
00:41:50,787 --> 00:41:53,870
(lighthearted music)

808
00:41:59,526 --> 00:42:03,089
(electronic buzzing)

809
00:42:03,089 --> 00:42:06,172
(lighthearted music)

810
00:42:20,910 --> 00:42:22,400
- Goddammit, Gibson.

811
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:24,810
Vincent Miles gave me
the wrong goddamn code.

812
00:42:24,810 --> 00:42:26,540
Why the goddam hell would he do that?

813
00:42:26,540 --> 00:42:28,800
It was goddamn suicide!

814
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:32,360
- It was goddamn suicide either way.

815
00:42:32,360 --> 00:42:33,846
- What do you know?

816
00:42:33,846 --> 00:42:35,403
You're a goddamn android!

817
00:42:37,170 --> 00:42:38,971
I programmed you!

818
00:42:38,971 --> 00:42:41,590
(lighthearted music)

819
00:42:41,590 --> 00:42:43,654
(Gibson groaning)

820
00:42:43,654 --> 00:42:44,571
Goddamn it.

821
00:42:48,450 --> 00:42:49,300
Get away from me.

822
00:42:52,331 --> 00:42:55,164
(low tense music)

823
00:43:03,410 --> 00:43:05,420
Monica, hi.

824
00:43:05,420 --> 00:43:07,913
Vincent and I here need your help.

825
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:09,633
- What is it?

826
00:43:09,633 --> 00:43:10,810
Is Vincent all right?

827
00:43:10,810 --> 00:43:12,360
- Oh, sure, sure.

828
00:43:12,360 --> 00:43:13,910
He just gave me the access code

829
00:43:13,910 --> 00:43:15,950
to the space casino development account.

830
00:43:15,950 --> 00:43:17,820
Very kind of him.

831
00:43:17,820 --> 00:43:19,920
But you know Monica you
never can be too sure

832
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:21,330
about these things so I'm gonna

833
00:43:21,330 --> 00:43:23,330
do a little cross referencing.

834
00:43:23,330 --> 00:43:25,300
You give me the exact same code

835
00:43:25,300 --> 00:43:27,070
that Vincent here just gave me,

836
00:43:27,070 --> 00:43:29,690
and he goes back to the lounge.

837
00:43:29,690 --> 00:43:34,620
If you don't, he's dead.

838
00:43:34,620 --> 00:43:36,440
It's your choice, Monica.

839
00:43:36,440 --> 00:43:38,210
Let your conscience be your guide.

840
00:43:38,210 --> 00:43:39,380
- Now, you listen to me, Barnes.

841
00:43:39,380 --> 00:43:40,440
You're not gonna get a thing from me

842
00:43:40,440 --> 00:43:41,893
until I've spoken to Vincent.

843
00:43:43,230 --> 00:43:44,793
- Monica, you got spunk.

844
00:43:46,690 --> 00:43:47,823
I hate spunk.

845
00:43:54,020 --> 00:43:56,900
If you ever wanna see your husband again

846
00:43:56,900 --> 00:44:00,350
you give me the goddamn code, now.

847
00:44:00,350 --> 00:44:01,370
- I can't.

848
00:44:01,370 --> 00:44:02,710
Vincent and Phillips are the only two

849
00:44:02,710 --> 00:44:05,190
who know it for security reasons.

850
00:44:05,190 --> 00:44:07,670
- Well, that is too bad
Monica because you just wrote

851
00:44:07,670 --> 00:44:09,573
your husband goddamn death sentence!

852
00:44:10,589 --> 00:44:13,910
(laser blasts)

853
00:44:13,910 --> 00:44:16,827
(tense drum music)

854
00:44:25,060 --> 00:44:28,700
Well, we'll just have to do
it the old fashioned hard way

855
00:44:29,670 --> 00:44:31,263
figure it out for ourselves.

856
00:44:38,090 --> 00:44:40,830
In about 15 minutes, my androidal amigo,

857
00:44:40,830 --> 00:44:44,823
I am going to be a multi billionaire.

858
00:44:46,230 --> 00:44:50,680
Why slave away for some
intergalactic corporation

859
00:44:50,680 --> 00:44:52,363
for 20 years,

860
00:44:54,690 --> 00:44:56,213
inching along.

861
00:44:57,563 --> 00:45:01,146
(mimicking sheep bleating)

862
00:45:02,080 --> 00:45:03,913
Kissing ass!

863
00:45:07,640 --> 00:45:12,060
When you can have it
all in about 15 minutes?

864
00:45:15,950 --> 00:45:18,530
- Barnes, Barnes.

865
00:45:18,530 --> 00:45:19,723
Hey Barnes you there?

866
00:45:22,276 --> 00:45:23,463
Barnes, Barnes, Barnes?

867
00:45:26,520 --> 00:45:28,100
- Yeah, yeah what?

868
00:45:28,100 --> 00:45:29,427
- I have a deal for you.

869
00:45:31,422 --> 00:45:33,210
- What could I possibly want from you?

870
00:45:33,210 --> 00:45:34,990
- Barnes, you and I speak the same lingo.

871
00:45:34,990 --> 00:45:36,870
We're both businessmen.

872
00:45:36,870 --> 00:45:38,240
We have our day jobs and a little

873
00:45:38,240 --> 00:45:40,390
creative moonlighting
on the side, capisce?

874
00:45:41,420 --> 00:45:42,253
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

875
00:45:42,253 --> 00:45:43,430
So what's the deal?

876
00:45:43,430 --> 00:45:44,800
- I'll tell you what Taylor is up to

877
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:47,640
if you guarantee that I'll
be on that life pod with you.

878
00:45:47,640 --> 00:45:48,473
- Taylor?

879
00:45:48,473 --> 00:45:49,942
- Look man,

880
00:45:49,942 --> 00:45:51,240
I didn't fall off the
software truck yesterday.

881
00:45:51,240 --> 00:45:54,210
I figure that right about now
you're running some bootleg

882
00:45:54,210 --> 00:45:56,590
program to crack the code
in Vincent's account.

883
00:45:56,590 --> 00:45:58,050
Do I have your attention yet?

884
00:45:58,050 --> 00:45:59,600
- Yeah, oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

885
00:45:59,600 --> 00:46:02,800
So what is, uh, what is Taylor planning?

886
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:04,920
- What's in it for me partner?

887
00:46:04,920 --> 00:46:06,670
- I'll send Gibson down for you.

888
00:46:06,670 --> 00:46:08,000
You wait by the door.

889
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:09,170
- I'm there.

890
00:46:09,170 --> 00:46:12,100
Look Tyler's heading
for the space suit hold.

891
00:46:12,100 --> 00:46:13,840
He's planning to find
his way to the bridge

892
00:46:13,840 --> 00:46:17,430
and activate the code three
emergency signal himself.

893
00:46:17,430 --> 00:46:18,503
- Whoa, well.

894
00:46:19,370 --> 00:46:20,423
Well thanks, partner.

895
00:46:23,460 --> 00:46:25,590
I'm gonna send Gibson
now for you right now.

896
00:46:25,590 --> 00:46:27,985
Why don't you go get by the door?

897
00:46:27,985 --> 00:46:28,818
Thanks.

898
00:46:28,818 --> 00:46:30,318
And just remember.

899
00:46:37,286 --> 00:46:40,286
(eerie tense music)

900
00:46:42,486 --> 00:46:44,986
(laser blast)

901
00:46:47,692 --> 00:46:49,687
- Look, the suit.

902
00:46:49,687 --> 00:46:52,642
(eerie tense music)

903
00:46:52,642 --> 00:46:55,725
(electronic beeping)

904
00:47:01,516 --> 00:47:03,340
- There you go, Taylor.

905
00:47:03,340 --> 00:47:05,540
That should help you
breath a little easier.

906
00:47:06,450 --> 00:47:07,860
- Mac was wrong.

907
00:47:07,860 --> 00:47:09,133
The room is pressurized.

908
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:11,110
Look, put that suit on.

909
00:47:11,110 --> 00:47:12,360
I'm gonna go get another.

910
00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:16,990
- You sure the room is pressurized?

911
00:47:16,990 --> 00:47:18,013
- Certainly hope so.

912
00:47:39,263 --> 00:47:44,263
(electronic beeping)
(tense music)

913
00:47:48,521 --> 00:47:50,982
(Barnes laughing)

914
00:47:50,982 --> 00:47:52,662
- Boy now, that should do it.

915
00:47:52,662 --> 00:47:54,305
Nice and tight.

916
00:47:54,305 --> 00:47:56,805
(tense music)

917
00:48:05,163 --> 00:48:07,913
(metal clanging)

918
00:48:21,982 --> 00:48:24,232
(laughing)

919
00:48:38,302 --> 00:48:39,606
- Bastard.

920
00:48:39,606 --> 00:48:41,350
Bastard, bastard, bastard, bastard!

921
00:48:41,350 --> 00:48:44,050
- Always get it on paper first, asshole.

922
00:48:44,050 --> 00:48:44,960
- Lying bastard!

923
00:48:48,244 --> 00:48:49,411
Lying bastard!

924
00:48:50,870 --> 00:48:52,270
- Yeah, to you too, partner.

925
00:49:17,851 --> 00:49:20,851
(eerie tense music)

926
00:49:22,350 --> 00:49:24,213
They make it so easy, Gibson.

927
00:49:26,240 --> 00:49:28,493
Like shooting fish in a barrel.

928
00:49:31,540 --> 00:49:32,584
Splat.

929
00:49:32,584 --> 00:49:36,073
(grunting)
(objects clattering)

930
00:49:36,073 --> 00:49:39,433
(rapid beeping)

931
00:49:39,433 --> 00:49:40,520
(laughs)

932
00:49:40,520 --> 00:49:41,933
How does that feel, Taylor?

933
00:49:44,748 --> 00:49:46,998
(laughing)

934
00:49:49,850 --> 00:49:51,953
Time to broaden your horizons.

935
00:49:55,182 --> 00:49:58,265
(electronic beeping)

936
00:50:02,144 --> 00:50:04,384
(groaning)

937
00:50:04,384 --> 00:50:07,467
(electronic beeping)

938
00:50:10,840 --> 00:50:13,090
(grunting)

939
00:50:14,376 --> 00:50:16,334
(shouting)
(tense music)

940
00:50:16,334 --> 00:50:19,001
(alarm blaring)

941
00:50:38,702 --> 00:50:40,535
Sweet dreams, asshole.

942
00:50:43,806 --> 00:50:46,473
(alarm blaring)

943
00:51:06,350 --> 00:51:07,183
- Taylor!

944
00:51:08,540 --> 00:51:09,373
Taylor!

945
00:51:17,721 --> 00:51:18,824
(panting)

946
00:51:18,824 --> 00:51:20,963
Are you all right?

947
00:51:20,963 --> 00:51:22,003
(groaning)

948
00:51:22,003 --> 00:51:24,253
(coughing)

949
00:51:26,280 --> 00:51:28,693
- Yeah, I'm okay now.

950
00:51:30,580 --> 00:51:33,223
Listen, Barnes is on to us.

951
00:51:34,060 --> 00:51:37,800
There's no way we can make it
to the bridge inside the ship.

952
00:51:37,800 --> 00:51:39,040
- What do we do?

953
00:51:39,040 --> 00:51:40,703
- We have to go outside the ship.

954
00:51:41,570 --> 00:51:43,110
- Outside the ship?

955
00:51:43,110 --> 00:51:43,943
- That's right.

956
00:51:44,980 --> 00:51:47,530
- Well, I guess I always
wanted to see outer space.

957
00:51:50,323 --> 00:51:53,656
(soft reflective music)

958
00:51:57,566 --> 00:52:01,300
I can't wait to tell my
friends at home about this.

959
00:52:01,300 --> 00:52:04,633
(soft reflective music)

960
00:52:32,801 --> 00:52:33,634
- Pick.

961
00:52:45,330 --> 00:52:46,413
How 'bout it?

962
00:52:48,970 --> 00:52:51,193
Pick any mood in the
whole freaking rainbow.

963
00:52:56,490 --> 00:52:58,410
Should go nicely with this, huh?

964
00:53:02,610 --> 00:53:04,460
Waited a long time for this vacation.

965
00:53:05,920 --> 00:53:06,943
Gonna enjoy myself.

966
00:53:10,880 --> 00:53:11,713
Are you?

967
00:53:20,180 --> 00:53:22,053
- We were married for 51 years.

968
00:53:22,920 --> 00:53:24,587
She died six months ago.

969
00:53:26,800 --> 00:53:28,550
We were to take this trip together.

970
00:53:31,140 --> 00:53:33,783
My daughter persuaded me to go anywhere.

971
00:53:35,119 --> 00:53:37,253
- [Jack] I bet you wish you
had listened to her, huh?

972
00:53:39,410 --> 00:53:43,000
- You'd think so but I have no regrets.

973
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:45,063
I took this trip for her memory.

974
00:53:50,213 --> 00:53:53,880
(uplifting classical music)

975
00:53:56,234 --> 00:53:59,901
(motorcycle engine revving)

976
00:54:18,780 --> 00:54:20,637
- Well, while we're at it.

977
00:54:24,173 --> 00:54:25,833
This is a picture of my mom.

978
00:54:27,150 --> 00:54:28,873
She lives in Spittle, Ireland.

979
00:54:30,420 --> 00:54:33,420
I used to be from Ireland,
too, once upon a time.

980
00:54:33,420 --> 00:54:35,453
I've been saving a long time to visit her.

981
00:54:36,423 --> 00:54:38,090
I guess I won't see the sun go down

982
00:54:38,090 --> 00:54:39,413
on Galway Bay, huh?

983
00:54:40,335 --> 00:54:44,002
(uplifting classical music)

984
00:54:51,199 --> 00:54:54,116
(drunken mumbling)

985
00:54:55,890 --> 00:54:59,237
- We're the last man and
woman in the whole universe.

986
00:55:02,949 --> 00:55:04,205
And the poorest.

987
00:55:04,205 --> 00:55:05,911
(laughing)

988
00:55:05,911 --> 00:55:08,161
- How about those up there?

989
00:55:09,007 --> 00:55:10,826
- [Koros] They don't count.

990
00:55:10,826 --> 00:55:13,076
(laughing)

991
00:55:15,890 --> 00:55:20,053
- Looks like Barnes forgot
one of his C4; explosives.

992
00:55:24,071 --> 00:55:26,904
(heavy breathing)

993
00:55:28,828 --> 00:55:31,995
(electronic clicking)

994
00:55:32,850 --> 00:55:33,683
- Bingo.

995
00:55:36,270 --> 00:55:37,103
- Boss?

996
00:55:42,760 --> 00:55:44,640
- Taylor is still flying high, huh?

997
00:55:46,710 --> 00:55:48,033
Well not high enough.

998
00:55:50,906 --> 00:55:52,572
Vroom.

999
00:55:52,572 --> 00:55:55,573
(electricity humming)

1000
00:55:55,573 --> 00:55:58,532
(engine blasting)

1001
00:55:58,532 --> 00:56:03,532
(groaning)
(eerie tense music)

1002
00:56:05,647 --> 00:56:06,480
- Dawn!

1003
00:56:07,330 --> 00:56:10,330
(eerie tense music)

1004
00:56:13,212 --> 00:56:16,462
(shouting frantically)

1005
00:56:28,339 --> 00:56:29,172
Dawn!

1006
00:56:30,747 --> 00:56:32,469
(grunts)

1007
00:56:32,469 --> 00:56:34,802
(groaning)

1008
00:56:41,617 --> 00:56:46,590
- That's what I call pulling
ourselves up by the bootstraps.

1009
00:56:46,590 --> 00:56:48,100
- Remember what I said about

1010
00:56:49,400 --> 00:56:52,003
having an overwhelming
urge to be naked with you?

1011
00:56:54,780 --> 00:56:56,240
- Yeah.

1012
00:56:56,240 --> 00:56:59,157
(soft jazz music)

1013
00:57:04,220 --> 00:57:05,673
- Well, how about it?

1014
00:57:10,419 --> 00:57:13,104
- Haven't you already been with me?

1015
00:57:13,104 --> 00:57:14,390
(laughing)

1016
00:57:14,390 --> 00:57:17,503
- No, no, no, no not that.

1017
00:57:22,421 --> 00:57:23,992
The real thing.

1018
00:57:23,992 --> 00:57:26,825
(soft jazz music)

1019
00:57:37,915 --> 00:57:42,915
(moaning)
(soft jazz music)

1020
00:57:47,200 --> 00:57:49,200
- Okay, there the schematic of the ship.

1021
00:57:50,110 --> 00:57:51,860
I need to find a way to life pods

1022
00:57:51,860 --> 00:57:53,443
before Barnes beats us to it.

1023
00:57:56,333 --> 00:57:57,166
Yes, look.

1024
00:57:57,166 --> 00:57:58,536
I got the route.

1025
00:57:58,536 --> 00:57:59,710
- Taylor, I've been thinking.

1026
00:57:59,710 --> 00:58:00,930
There's no way Barnes could get back

1027
00:58:00,930 --> 00:58:02,840
to Earth on an emergency vessel

1028
00:58:02,840 --> 00:58:04,773
without being detected upon re-entry.

1029
00:58:06,750 --> 00:58:08,150
Someone must be helping him.

1030
00:58:09,251 --> 00:58:10,084
- You know what?

1031
00:58:10,084 --> 00:58:10,917
You're absolutely right.

1032
00:58:10,917 --> 00:58:12,300
That's exactly what he's doing.

1033
00:58:12,300 --> 00:58:13,133
Shit.

1034
00:58:14,430 --> 00:58:16,050
- What are you doing?

1035
00:58:16,050 --> 00:58:18,353
- I'm gonna change the course of the ship.

1036
00:58:19,730 --> 00:58:22,343
Give him something to think
about and buy us some time.

1037
00:58:23,261 --> 00:58:25,880
(electronic buzzing)

1038
00:58:25,880 --> 00:58:26,713
- Oh, fuck me!

1039
00:58:27,640 --> 00:58:28,543
- What's going on?

1040
00:58:29,840 --> 00:58:31,920
- I gotta do some damage control.

1041
00:58:31,920 --> 00:58:32,753
Goddamn it.

1042
00:58:32,753 --> 00:58:35,073
- Damage control, what
kind of damage control?

1043
00:58:35,073 --> 00:58:36,220
What do you mean?

1044
00:58:36,220 --> 00:58:39,633
- Just don't do anything
until further notice.

1045
00:58:43,430 --> 00:58:44,670
Taylor's changed...

1046
00:58:47,160 --> 00:58:49,053
Put down the cigar, asshole.

1047
00:58:50,580 --> 00:58:52,870
Taylor has changed our coordinates.

1048
00:58:52,870 --> 00:58:54,353
Gibson, go get them.

1049
00:58:56,915 --> 00:58:58,140
(rapid beeping)

1050
00:58:58,140 --> 00:58:58,973
- Get them?

1051
00:59:00,410 --> 00:59:03,508
- Kill 'em, moron.

1052
00:59:03,508 --> 00:59:04,341
Kill 'em!

1053
00:59:05,450 --> 00:59:06,890
- Okay, look.

1054
00:59:06,890 --> 00:59:08,230
See here?

1055
00:59:08,230 --> 00:59:10,010
You take this corridor right here,

1056
00:59:10,010 --> 00:59:11,170
through the bulkhead.

1057
00:59:11,170 --> 00:59:13,090
It's gonna be right behind the lounge.

1058
00:59:13,090 --> 00:59:15,923
You blow through that wall
and you'll get them out.

1059
00:59:17,330 --> 00:59:19,813
- You're making it sound
like I'm doing this alone.

1060
00:59:20,710 --> 00:59:21,850
- You are.

1061
00:59:21,850 --> 00:59:22,683
- What?

1062
00:59:23,600 --> 00:59:26,360
- Look, there's only room
on that life pod for seven.

1063
00:59:26,360 --> 00:59:27,950
That's you and the others.

1064
00:59:27,950 --> 00:59:30,800
I'm counting on you to
get them out of there.

1065
00:59:30,800 --> 00:59:31,890
- What about you?

1066
00:59:31,890 --> 00:59:33,400
- I'm going to the bridge.

1067
00:59:33,400 --> 00:59:35,150
I can get there from here.

1068
00:59:35,150 --> 00:59:37,330
There's still a chance I
can send a distress signal

1069
00:59:37,330 --> 00:59:39,110
and if Vincent is still alive,

1070
00:59:39,110 --> 00:59:40,260
I'm taking him with me.

1071
00:59:41,210 --> 00:59:46,210
Look, attach the C4 explosive
to the flair like this.

1072
00:59:46,250 --> 00:59:48,050
When you're ready, pull the top off.

1073
00:59:48,913 --> 00:59:50,860
The flare is self igniting, but be careful

1074
00:59:50,860 --> 00:59:51,803
the fuse is short.

1075
00:59:54,040 --> 00:59:55,020
- Taylor.

1076
00:59:55,020 --> 00:59:56,813
- Dawn, take it.

1077
00:59:57,860 --> 00:59:58,883
I'm counting on you.

1078
01:00:00,370 --> 01:00:02,616
Now go, we don't have much time.

1079
01:00:02,616 --> 01:00:05,866
(soft touching music)

1080
01:00:24,670 --> 01:00:27,837
- This should take care of the others.

1081
01:00:32,440 --> 01:00:33,896
(low humming)

1082
01:00:33,896 --> 01:00:35,330
(alarm blaring)
- What's that sound?

1083
01:00:35,330 --> 01:00:37,320
- He's shutting off the air.

1084
01:00:37,320 --> 01:00:39,656
We won't be getting more oxygen.

1085
01:00:39,656 --> 01:00:40,489
What are we gonna do, Jack?

1086
01:00:40,489 --> 01:00:41,693
- We wait for Taylor.

1087
01:00:44,280 --> 01:00:45,113
He'll be back for us.

1088
01:00:45,970 --> 01:00:46,820
He said he would.

1089
01:00:47,917 --> 01:00:50,834
(tense jazz music)

1090
01:01:18,692 --> 01:01:19,859
- It makes him

1091
01:01:21,252 --> 01:01:22,669
and it mores him.

1092
01:01:24,116 --> 01:01:25,116
Sets him on.

1093
01:01:26,310 --> 01:01:28,340
Takes them off.

1094
01:01:28,340 --> 01:01:30,087
It persuades him.

1095
01:01:32,094 --> 01:01:33,193
And his heart can say.

1096
01:01:35,812 --> 01:01:37,562
Makes him stand, too.

1097
01:01:39,134 --> 01:01:40,217
Not stand to.

1098
01:01:41,454 --> 01:01:44,371
(soft jazz music)

1099
01:02:03,116 --> 01:02:03,949
Oh, Sarah.

1100
01:02:04,963 --> 01:02:05,796
- Anna.

1101
01:02:05,796 --> 01:02:07,545
- Anna, Anna, Anna.

1102
01:02:07,545 --> 01:02:09,878
(giggling)

1103
01:02:12,905 --> 01:02:15,738
(heavy breathing)

1104
01:02:24,620 --> 01:02:27,537
(tense drum music)

1105
01:03:27,035 --> 01:03:29,368
(screaming)

1106
01:03:31,836 --> 01:03:36,669
(grunting)
(tense music)

1107
01:03:42,529 --> 01:03:43,362
- No, no.

1108
01:03:45,650 --> 01:03:46,950
- We'll meet in two hours.

1109
01:03:47,920 --> 01:03:52,460
By that time, the Star
Princess should be long gone.

1110
01:03:52,460 --> 01:03:54,057
- Two hours?

1111
01:03:54,057 --> 01:03:55,054
That's impossible.

1112
01:03:55,054 --> 01:03:55,887
The corporation will suspect something

1113
01:03:55,887 --> 01:03:57,310
if I'm that far off schedule.

1114
01:03:57,310 --> 01:03:58,580
- Your call, Katz.

1115
01:03:58,580 --> 01:04:03,010
Me, I'll take the risk, but you're out.

1116
01:04:03,010 --> 01:04:03,893
You got that?

1117
01:04:04,880 --> 01:04:07,060
You get nothing cowboy.

1118
01:04:07,060 --> 01:04:08,836
- [Katz] All right I'll meet you

1119
01:04:08,836 --> 01:04:10,800
but this is making things
very difficult for me.

1120
01:04:10,800 --> 01:04:12,435
- Yeah, yeah yeah.

1121
01:04:12,435 --> 01:04:13,680
Why don't you tell
someone who gives a shit?

1122
01:04:13,680 --> 01:04:16,080
You'll hear from me when I
have the new coordinates.

1123
01:04:16,080 --> 01:04:17,673
Over and out.

1124
01:04:23,470 --> 01:04:25,380
- Good help is hard to find.

1125
01:04:25,380 --> 01:04:28,297
(tense drum music)

1126
01:04:32,138 --> 01:04:34,471
(grunting)

1127
01:04:42,290 --> 01:04:43,924
- All right.

1128
01:04:43,924 --> 01:04:45,624
Taylor, can we talking about this?

1129
01:04:46,580 --> 01:04:47,902
- Okay.

1130
01:04:47,902 --> 01:04:50,152
(grunting)

1131
01:04:55,225 --> 01:04:57,558
(groaning)

1132
01:05:00,140 --> 01:05:01,764
- Goodbye.

1133
01:05:01,764 --> 01:05:04,840
(electronic beeping)

1134
01:05:04,840 --> 01:05:05,923
Dawn Taggert.

1135
01:05:08,681 --> 01:05:11,599
(groaning)
(wet tearing)

1136
01:05:11,599 --> 01:05:14,516
(tense drum music)

1137
01:05:18,437 --> 01:05:21,210
(rapid beeping)

1138
01:05:21,210 --> 01:05:22,043
Dawn.

1139
01:05:25,504 --> 01:05:26,490
Taggert?

1140
01:05:26,490 --> 01:05:27,693
(grunting)

1141
01:05:27,693 --> 01:05:29,026
(explosion)

1142
01:05:29,026 --> 01:05:31,859
(woman screaming)

1143
01:05:38,083 --> 01:05:39,666
- Dawn, what the...

1144
01:05:42,322 --> 01:05:43,353
What the hell is going on?

1145
01:05:44,580 --> 01:05:47,993
- Seems to me like good
old fashioned fornication.

1146
01:05:50,180 --> 01:05:52,590
- Okay, everyone get
dressed and follow me.

1147
01:05:52,590 --> 01:05:54,140
We found a way to the life pod.

1148
01:05:55,810 --> 01:05:57,130
- You mean we're going home?

1149
01:05:57,130 --> 01:05:57,963
- Let's go.

1150
01:05:57,963 --> 01:05:58,796
Come on.

1151
01:06:00,110 --> 01:06:01,500
Go move, move.

1152
01:06:02,717 --> 01:06:03,550
- Come on.

1153
01:06:03,550 --> 01:06:07,217
Get a move on.
- To the right, to the right.

1154
01:06:17,780 --> 01:06:20,562
- This reminds me of the old war.

1155
01:06:20,562 --> 01:06:23,170
We were going through a channel,

1156
01:06:23,170 --> 01:06:26,480
taller than the alps

1157
01:06:26,480 --> 01:06:28,860
and the enemy were just on the far side.

1158
01:06:28,860 --> 01:06:30,162
- Move it, gramps,

1159
01:06:30,162 --> 01:06:32,557
you're making it bad for all of us.

1160
01:06:32,557 --> 01:06:35,501
- And I will try and make it
bad for us back in the lounge.

1161
01:06:35,501 --> 01:06:36,510
- What you talking about?

1162
01:06:36,510 --> 01:06:38,253
- Shut you up or I shut you up.

1163
01:06:42,498 --> 01:06:47,498
(electronic beeping)
(tense drum music)

1164
01:06:58,250 --> 01:07:03,250
- An extraordinary end
for a very ordinary guy.

1165
01:07:05,901 --> 01:07:08,901
(tense drum music)

1166
01:07:13,610 --> 01:07:15,460
Gotta give you credit though, Taylor.

1167
01:07:16,530 --> 01:07:18,400
You've made me work for my money

1168
01:07:20,199 --> 01:07:21,353
but it was a wasted effort.

1169
01:07:24,070 --> 01:07:25,993
Goodbye Star Princess.

1170
01:07:29,618 --> 01:07:30,451
The end.

1171
01:07:31,315 --> 01:07:32,974
- Where are you gonna go, Barnes?

1172
01:07:32,974 --> 01:07:34,199
They're gonna catch you.

1173
01:07:34,199 --> 01:07:35,901
- Not where I'm going.

1174
01:07:35,901 --> 01:07:37,639
- And where's that?

1175
01:07:37,639 --> 01:07:39,517
- Oh gee, Taylor.

1176
01:07:39,517 --> 01:07:41,020
I didn't know you cared.

1177
01:07:41,020 --> 01:07:42,640
- Come on, Barnes.

1178
01:07:42,640 --> 01:07:44,157
Humor me.

1179
01:07:44,157 --> 01:07:46,740
(laser blast)

1180
01:07:48,410 --> 01:07:50,980
- I'm starting a space colony of my own

1181
01:07:50,980 --> 01:07:53,510
populated by androids,

1182
01:07:53,510 --> 01:07:57,553
programmed by me, controlled by me.

1183
01:07:58,590 --> 01:08:03,390
You see humans are so unpredictable.

1184
01:08:03,390 --> 01:08:05,776
(grunting)

1185
01:08:05,776 --> 01:08:08,026
(groaning)

1186
01:08:10,509 --> 01:08:15,342
(grunting)
(tense music)

1187
01:08:16,765 --> 01:08:19,098
(shouting)

1188
01:08:23,554 --> 01:08:25,972
(laser blast)

1189
01:08:25,972 --> 01:08:28,170
(grunting)

1190
01:08:28,170 --> 01:08:30,670
(gas hissing)

1191
01:08:32,948 --> 01:08:35,865
(tense drum music)

1192
01:08:39,129 --> 01:08:41,296
(gasping)

1193
01:08:58,986 --> 01:09:01,236
(gasping)

1194
01:09:18,282 --> 01:09:19,703
- Only one more airlock to go.

1195
01:09:21,615 --> 01:09:22,559
(rapid beeping)

1196
01:09:22,559 --> 01:09:23,392
- No!

1197
01:09:23,392 --> 01:09:24,754
(screaming)

1198
01:09:24,754 --> 01:09:26,534
(shouting)

1199
01:09:26,534 --> 01:09:28,867
(explosion)

1200
01:09:31,695 --> 01:09:32,528
- Jack.

1201
01:09:39,076 --> 01:09:40,576
You saved my life.

1202
01:09:45,274 --> 01:09:46,107
No.

1203
01:09:47,818 --> 01:09:48,651
No.

1204
01:09:55,670 --> 01:09:58,436
- We have to go now, Dawn.

1205
01:09:58,436 --> 01:09:59,269
Come on.

1206
01:10:31,591 --> 01:10:34,424
(engine humming)

1207
01:10:35,610 --> 01:10:37,673
- Taylor, come in, Taylor.

1208
01:10:39,750 --> 01:10:40,997
I'm going back for him.

1209
01:10:40,997 --> 01:10:41,900
- He said he was staying with the ship.

1210
01:10:41,900 --> 01:10:43,140
- He doesn't know there's room.

1211
01:10:43,140 --> 01:10:43,973
- Forget him.

1212
01:10:43,973 --> 01:10:44,880
We go now.

1213
01:10:44,880 --> 01:10:46,960
- After everything he's done for us,

1214
01:10:46,960 --> 01:10:48,843
all you care about is yourself.

1215
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:52,360
- You heard the lady.

1216
01:10:52,360 --> 01:10:54,353
- Give me a break you geriatric psycho.

1217
01:10:58,070 --> 01:11:00,100
- I've initiated the blast off.

1218
01:11:00,100 --> 01:11:02,910
I'll be back with Taylor in five minutes.

1219
01:11:02,910 --> 01:11:03,893
- Five minutes.

1220
01:11:04,954 --> 01:11:08,537
(lighthearted drum music)

1221
01:11:34,860 --> 01:11:36,350
They're never gonna make it.

1222
01:11:38,293 --> 01:11:42,460
(lighthearted suspenseful music)

1223
01:11:50,750 --> 01:11:51,889
- Dawn, what are you doing here?

1224
01:11:51,889 --> 01:11:52,722
- Come on.

1225
01:11:52,722 --> 01:11:53,555
- I've disarmed the bomb

1226
01:11:53,555 --> 01:11:55,169
but I can't stop the countdown.

1227
01:11:55,169 --> 01:11:56,280
- There's room for you
in the life pod, quick.

1228
01:11:56,280 --> 01:11:57,113
- What?

1229
01:11:57,113 --> 01:11:58,294
I'll tell you later.

1230
01:11:58,294 --> 01:11:59,127
Come on.
- What happened?

1231
01:11:59,127 --> 01:12:00,228
- Follow me.
- What happened?

1232
01:12:00,228 --> 01:12:01,233
- Come on.

1233
01:12:01,233 --> 01:12:04,093
(beeping)

1234
01:12:04,093 --> 01:12:05,754
- Where are they?

1235
01:12:05,754 --> 01:12:09,337
(lighthearted tense music)

1236
01:12:26,409 --> 01:12:28,076
- We can lose these.

1237
01:12:31,371 --> 01:12:33,038
- Come on, come on.

1238
01:12:34,033 --> 01:12:35,291
- They're not gonna make it.

1239
01:12:35,291 --> 01:12:36,413
- You're just getting that?

1240
01:12:48,913 --> 01:12:49,746
- Open!

1241
01:12:49,746 --> 01:12:51,639
- Dawn, no they're gone.

1242
01:12:51,639 --> 01:12:53,760
They're gone, they're gone.

1243
01:12:55,803 --> 01:12:58,220
(screaming)

1244
01:13:10,644 --> 01:13:13,894
- [Dawn] Do you think there's any hope.

1245
01:13:15,936 --> 01:13:17,036
- It'd take a miracle.

1246
01:13:24,140 --> 01:13:26,563
- Taylor, a miracle.

1247
01:13:28,336 --> 01:13:30,200
- We've got a shooting star.

1248
01:13:30,200 --> 01:13:32,400
- They're heading for
us, right for us, Taylor

1249
01:13:32,400 --> 01:13:34,150
they know we're here.

1250
01:13:35,140 --> 01:13:36,227
- Come on, let's go.

1251
01:13:39,781 --> 01:13:41,157
The core communications are down,

1252
01:13:41,157 --> 01:13:43,657
I'm just hoping the docking
equipment still works.

1253
01:13:48,340 --> 01:13:49,359
Yes.

1254
01:13:49,359 --> 01:13:50,336
- Attention.
- Come on.

1255
01:13:50,336 --> 01:13:53,518
- [Electronic Voice] Docking
procedure has been initiated.

1256
01:13:53,518 --> 01:13:54,392
Attention.

1257
01:13:54,392 --> 01:13:55,700
- We weren't even sending
a distress signal.

1258
01:13:55,700 --> 01:13:57,872
You know, they must of seen us on visual.

1259
01:13:57,872 --> 01:14:00,299
- Who could be looking for us?

1260
01:14:00,299 --> 01:14:02,059
- I don't know.
- Attention.

1261
01:14:02,059 --> 01:14:03,061
- [Dawn] Wait, Taylor.

1262
01:14:03,061 --> 01:14:03,894
- [Electronic Voice]
All crew please report

1263
01:14:03,894 --> 01:14:05,320
to the docking bay,

1264
01:14:05,320 --> 01:14:07,233
docking procedure has commenced.

1265
01:14:08,981 --> 01:14:11,883
- [Dawn] It can't be, look.

1266
01:14:11,883 --> 01:14:13,633
- It sure as hell is.

1267
01:14:18,934 --> 01:14:21,184
(laughing)

1268
01:14:27,390 --> 01:14:28,780
- Mac.

1269
01:14:28,780 --> 01:14:31,073
- Good evening, first mate Taylor.

1270
01:14:34,030 --> 01:14:36,853
Good evening, Dawn.

1271
01:14:39,603 --> 01:14:40,436
- How did you?

1272
01:14:43,320 --> 01:14:44,153
Oh, Mac.

1273
01:14:47,090 --> 01:14:49,550
- We found him drifting
out there by pure accident.

1274
01:14:49,550 --> 01:14:51,070
Pulled him in for salvage.

1275
01:14:51,070 --> 01:14:52,910
He insisted we downloaded his memories

1276
01:14:52,910 --> 01:14:55,000
to determine his probable coordinates,

1277
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:56,260
said he had to report back to you

1278
01:14:56,260 --> 01:14:57,660
on how to get to the bridge.

1279
01:14:59,410 --> 01:15:00,540
- Thank you, Captain.

1280
01:15:00,540 --> 01:15:01,770
- I better get back to my flight deck

1281
01:15:01,770 --> 01:15:03,664
and get us out of here.

1282
01:15:03,664 --> 01:15:07,831
(soft triumphant classical music)

1283
01:15:41,848 --> 01:15:44,848
(upbeat jazz music)

1284
01:16:39,062 --> 01:16:42,145
(upbeat jazz music)
