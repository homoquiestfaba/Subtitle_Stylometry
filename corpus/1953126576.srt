Female brain.

167
00:10:23,889 --> 00:10:26,449
Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah.

168
00:10:27,693 --> 00:10:31,459
You know, I should just
come by the office next time.

169
00:10:31,597 --> 00:10:34,862
- I mean, I'd love to meet everybody.
- Our sales guys are barely in.

170
00:10:35,001 --> 00:10:38,266
This is the new office. We do
most of our sales by the telephone

171
00:10:38,404 --> 00:10:40,269
and the rest of the time
we're out networking. In fact,

172
00:10:40,406 --> 00:10:43,273
you should think about
joining some clubs.

(BOB SHUDDERING)

174
00:10:47,913 --> 00:10:51,542
- Can't get used to this weather.
- You never get used to it, Bob, ever.

175
00:10:51,684 --> 00:10:54,380
There's two seasons here,
winter and road works.

176
00:10:55,021 --> 00:10:57,649
Hey, that's a nice car.
It's pretty easy to spot.

177
00:10:57,790 --> 00:11:01,385
Yeah, my initials.
Some son of a bitch got there first.

178
00:11:01,527 --> 00:11:04,587
- Look at all this.
- Hey, I wanted to tell you,

179
00:11:04,730 --> 00:11:07,392
I stopped by and saw that trucker,
off route 45.

180
00:11:07,533 --> 00:11:09,398
I hope he made the long drive
worth it for ya.

181
00:11:09,535 --> 00:11:12,663
Oh, yeah, yeah. He's a super nice guy,
but we actually found out

182
00:11:12,805 --> 00:11:14,898
that he could do better with an outfit
he already trucks for.

183
00:11:18,477 --> 00:11:20,877
There's nothing wrong with a little
information management, Bob.

184
00:11:21,013 --> 00:11:23,709
Well, truth of it,
he didn't have that much to spend.

185
00:11:23,849 --> 00:11:25,976
But he did introduce me
to a neighbor of his

186
00:11:26,118 --> 00:11:28,518
who's looking for
a full homeowners package.

187
00:11:28,654 --> 00:11:31,589
He's a sweet old man. He's a retired
farmer. I'm actually going out there...

188
00:11:31,724 --> 00:11:34,352
Be careful of seniors.
They'll keep you out there all day

189
00:11:34,493 --> 00:11:38,589
- just to have somebody to talk to.
- No, no. He's pretty interested.

190
00:11:38,731 --> 00:11:40,358
He's just wavering
on the amount of coverage.

191
00:11:40,499 --> 00:11:42,524
I mean, we don't wanna
have him over-insured.

192
00:11:43,636 --> 00:11:45,160
There's no such thing.

(MICKEY, INDISTINCT)... Bob.

195
00:12:05,524 --> 00:12:06,286
Maybe he forgot, he's older.

196
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:08,652
I don't wanna waste
any more of your time.

197
00:12:08,794 --> 00:12:10,022
I'll come back next week.

198
00:12:10,162 --> 00:12:13,689
Hey, it was really nice of you, though,
to come out, help me try to close.

199
00:12:13,833 --> 00:12:16,563
Crappy job shoveling.
This is an accident waitin' to happen.

200
00:12:16,702 --> 00:12:19,933
You should stress that in your sales
pitch, scare him a little bit, you know?

201
00:12:20,773 --> 00:12:26,040
- Bob? Nice to see you.
- (CHUCKLES) Hey, Frank.

202
00:12:26,178 --> 00:12:27,668
Mickey, this is Frank Richie.

203
00:12:27,813 --> 00:12:29,974
This is the guy that asked me about
the truck insurance.

204
00:12:30,116 --> 00:12:32,778
Oh! Oh, Mickey Prohaska. Hi.

205
00:12:32,918 --> 00:12:34,249
- Nice to meet you.
- Yeah, yeah.

206
00:12:34,386 --> 00:12:36,513
Say, Bob, thanks for your help.

207
00:12:36,655 --> 00:12:40,318
You saved me a good 200 bucks.
You fellas here to meet with Gorvy?

208
00:12:40,459 --> 00:12:42,222
Yeah, yeah,
but he doesn't seem to be in.

209
00:12:42,361 --> 00:12:44,591
Oh, come on in. Maybe he's asleep.

(PHONE DISCONNECT

211
00:12:57,476 --> 00:12:59,501
He must be outside with his dog.

212
00:12:59,645 --> 00:13:02,614
- It's chilly here.
- Yeah, he keeps the temperature low.

213
00:13:02,748 --> 00:13:04,147
Doesn't like to waste.

214
00:13:04,283 --> 00:13:07,446
- I can see that.
- Oh, some of these things are his sister's.

215
00:13:07,586 --> 00:13:10,282
I brought 'em down after she went
into the nursing home.

216
00:13:10,422 --> 00:13:12,788
I told him I'd find out if any of it
was worth anything.

217
00:13:13,859 --> 00:13:16,225
I did some truckin' for an auctioneer.

218
00:13:16,362 --> 00:13:19,354
He told me a guy once paid
a hundred grand for a rug.

- Anything can happen, right?

the way they promised.

I could make some coffee.

231
00:13:55,868 --> 00:13:59,634
I can't stay. Did you get a chance
to take those pictures?

232
00:13:59,772 --> 00:14:01,330
Well, I took pictures of Petey.

233
00:14:01,473 --> 00:14:03,839
No. I meant the pictures
for the auctioneer.

234

- I'm doin' a run for him this week.
- (YAPPING)

Yeah, I was upstairs. I took everything
down so I could see them.

It was too dark up there.
Here, look what I found.

- Snow shoes.
- I've always wanted to try those.

Well, take them.
I got no use for them no more.

- OK.
- They're here to help ya. Bye, guys.

241
00:14:27,066 --> 00:14:30,297
- Bye.
- Well, we might as well sit down.

242
00:14:31,337 --> 00:14:32,998
What do I need insurance for?

243
00:14:33,138 --> 00:14:35,766
Well, for one thing,
to protect your valuables.

00:14:35,908 --> 00:14:38,308
I don't got no valuables,
except for Petey.

- Do you sell dog insurance?
- No, but we do protect property.

And we insure with liability coverage.

happen out there on your front porch

Well, nobody comes here much except
Frank and he wears those big boots,

250

you know, with cleats. So he's OK.

What about the mailman?

252
00:14:59,064 --> 00:15:02,033
If, for instance,
your dog there were to bite him?

253
00:15:02,167 --> 00:15:03,794
He could sue you for a lot of money.

254
00:15:03,936 --> 00:15:08,066
No. He's a nice guy.
He wouldn't sue nobody.

Well, I got some peanut brittle.
Fresh made if ya like.

256
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:17,678
- No, we should probably get going.
- Yeah, I'm OK.

- Thank you.
- Yeah.

in this one, but I'm not sure.

with the guy in the back there?

You've been outta the house
for two months.

266
00:15:42,641 --> 00:15:43,938
I know. I really miss you.

267
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:47,511
This payin' for two places
is killing me financially.

00:15:47,646 --> 00:15:49,273
I may have to take out
a second loan on the house.

If you need money so bad,
why don't you sell that car?

Don't be ridiculous, Jo Ann.

271
00:15:53,085 --> 00:15:55,918
I can't show up to a sales call
drivin' a crappy car.

272
00:15:56,055 --> 00:15:57,386
Yeah, well, you went behind my back!

273
00:15:57,523 --> 00:15:58,854
We should've discussed it
like married people.

274
00:15:58,991 --> 00:16:02,222
Discuss what? Don Schmidt gave me
a great trade-in on my car.

- He's a policy holder.
- So you bartered

276
00:16:03,996 --> 00:16:06,863
- with Shane's college fund?
- No, he's 14 years old.

277

- You have four years to pay it back.

be mad at somebody, be mad at Ed.

paid child support?

280

- Oh, please.
- Hey. Whoa. Hey.

281
00:16:15,374 --> 00:16:17,069
- I'm not gonna...
- Listen, look, look, look.

00:16:17,209 --> 00:16:19,973
Look at this, huh?

the convention is this year.

284
00:16:23,749 --> 00:16:27,241
It's gonna be all warm and nice.
We could all get away again.

285
00:16:27,386 --> 00:16:28,978
That'd be great, wouldn't it?

286
00:16:31,457 --> 00:16:33,254
I gotta get to work.

They need a new credit card number.
The one they have for you is maxed.

We're out of coffee.

292

I asked you to get some more milk.

293
00:16:58,817 --> 00:17:02,150
You know, I am capable of doing more
than just making coffee.

294
00:17:02,287 --> 00:17:03,311
I could do anything.

295
00:17:04,723 --> 00:17:08,181
Maybe this isn't the right job for me.
I gotta think about my future.

296
00:17:08,327 --> 00:17:10,795
Karla, I got a plan for your future, OK?

297
00:17:10,929 --> 00:17:13,261
I decided to make you
Chief Financial Officer.

298
00:17:13,399 --> 00:17:16,334
You'll be handling all the bookkeeping
from now on. You can start with those.

299
00:17:16,468 --> 00:17:17,867
- Wait, these are personal.
- All right?

300
00:17:18,003 --> 00:17:19,197
Not the agency's.

301
00:17:19,338 --> 00:17:22,171
- I am the agency, Karla.
- What about my raise?

302
00:17:24,143 --> 00:17:27,442
Do you have any of that
Christmas candy I gave you?

303
00:17:28,614 --> 00:17:30,707
Listen, we're gonna see if you can
handle more responsibility.

304
00:17:30,849 --> 00:17:33,317
If you can, we're gonna do a salary
review at the end of the month, OK?

Oh, you must mean Bob.

308
00:17:40,926 --> 00:17:43,087
So, you decided to buy a policy?

309
00:17:44,163 --> 00:17:47,064
- Great.
- That a sale?

310
00:17:47,199 --> 00:17:48,291
I'll take that.

311
00:17:49,001 --> 00:17:50,332
Where... where is the other guy?

312
00:17:50,469 --> 00:17:54,565
He was unavailable.
What made you change your mind?

313
00:17:54,706 --> 00:17:58,904
My TV's broken. You told me that
the insurance would take care of it.

314
00:17:59,044 --> 00:18:01,308
Well, it doesn't exactly work that way.

315
00:18:01,447 --> 00:18:04,473
Besides, you have to have a policy
in order to file a claim.

316
00:18:04,616 --> 00:18:07,847
Yeah, well, that's why I called you
over here. I want to get a policy.

317
00:18:07,986 --> 00:18:12,446
- That's a very smart decision.
- Yeah. So how much would this be?

318
00:18:12,591 --> 00:18:17,221
Well, for your property here,
I'd recommend insuring it for $300,000.

319
00:18:18,397 --> 00:18:21,423
For this little place?
$300,000 for this?

320
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:23,159
Nothing here is worth that much money.

321
00:18:23,302 --> 00:18:25,770
You'd be very surprised.
It starts to add up.

322
00:18:25,904 --> 00:18:30,273
Your friend, Frank, said that that rug
alone could be worth $100,000.

323
00:18:30,409 --> 00:18:32,104
- Get away!
- Oh, yeah.

324
00:18:32,244 --> 00:18:33,472
This rug right here?

325
00:18:33,612 --> 00:18:37,480
For $100 a month, you can protect it,

00:28:07,619 --> 00:28:09,177
- Oh.
- Oh!

489
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:13,222
It's $122.41.
I knew there was more than $100.

490
00:28:13,358 --> 00:28:16,054
And that includes the $10
I already gave ya.

491
00:28:16,194 --> 00:28:18,025
- What?
- For the violin.

492
00:28:18,163 --> 00:28:21,997
Oh. A man called me from Chicago,
he wants to buy the violin.

493
00:28:22,133 --> 00:28:25,398
- He even wrote me a letter about it.
- No, no, no, no. We...

494
00:28:25,537 --> 00:28:27,801
We have a deal. I'm takin' the violin.

495
00:28:27,939 --> 00:28:30,339
- What?
- For my stepson.

496
00:28:30,475 --> 00:28:32,670
We already talked about it,
he's all excited. I'm taking it.

497
00:28:32,811 --> 00:28:35,041
I don't know. I have a fishing pole,
I can give him...

498
00:28:35,180 --> 00:28:38,616
No! No, Gorvy, that's not the deal.
He doesn't want a fishing pole.

499
00:28:38,750 --> 00:28:40,581
- No, thanks.
- Then what do I tell

500
00:28:40,719 --> 00:28:41,447
the man from Chicago?

501
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:43,585
<i>He's coming all the way to see it.</i>

502
00:28:44,723 --> 00:28:46,657
MAN: No, I'm really sorry,
but the Tononi's not for sale.

503
00:28:46,791 --> 00:28:50,090
I was sure that I mentioned that.
I'm so sorry if I didn't.

504
00:28:50,228 --> 00:28:52,321
No, it's... I have a buyer for it.

505
00:28:53,531 --> 00:28:57,092
Could you just give me
the best number to call you at?

506
00:28:57,235 --> 00:29:01,695
Is that... Yes, is that 7-7-3? Uh...

507
00:29:02,373 --> 00:29:03,567
Yes, that's terrific.

508
00:29:03,708 --> 00:29:06,768
Thank you very, very much.
I will get right back to you.

509
00:29:07,645 --> 00:29:10,375
Thank you, bye-bye. Excuse me,
do you have an appointment?

510
00:29:10,515 --> 00:29:12,073
I'm here about the violin you wanted.

511
00:29:13,051 --> 00:29:15,110
Oh, you're the guy
from the farm in Wisconsin.

512
00:29:15,253 --> 00:29:16,880
- Yeah, Mickey Prohaska.
- Right. Yeah.

513
00:29:17,021 --> 00:29:20,684
Yeah, I'm representing the seller.
He's elderly, no condition to come here

514
00:29:20,825 --> 00:29:22,588
and do business,
so he's asked me to handle the sale.

515
00:29:22,727 --> 00:29:26,288
Well, as I said in my letter,
I'm prepared to offer $25,000.

516
00:29:26,431 --> 00:29:28,126
I realize that. That's why I'm here.

517
00:29:28,266 --> 00:29:31,394
I don't want you taking advantage
of an old man, with all due respect.

518
00:29:31,536 --> 00:29:33,163
Some of these violins are worth
a lot more than that.

519
00:29:33,304 --> 00:29:37,035
Oh, they certainly are,
and some of them are worth a lot less.

520
00:29:37,175 --> 00:29:39,405
And the one you're representing
happens to be a very nice copy

521
00:29:39,544 --> 00:29:41,637
of a Stainer. Yeah...

522
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:43,907
Jacobus Stainer's instruments
were copied

523
00:29:44,048 --> 00:29:45,811
and reproduced all over Germany.

524
00:29:45,950 --> 00:29:51,217
Right down to the handwritten signature
inside the body of the violin.

525
00:29:51,356 --> 00:29:52,983
- Uh-huh.
- Uh...

526
00:29:53,124 --> 00:29:56,491
You can show that to your client,
if you like.

527
00:29:57,462 --> 00:30:00,727
Now, yours happens to have
an exceptional sound quality,

528
00:30:00,865 --> 00:30:03,925
and it's also one of the better copies
I've come across.

529
00:30:04,068 --> 00:30:08,300
Which is why the buyer's willing
to pay you $30,000 for it.

530
00:30:08,439 --> 00:30:11,203
$30,000? What happened to 25?

531
00:30:11,342 --> 00:30:13,071
I take a commission.

532
00:30:14,379 --> 00:30:17,246
If you wanna have somebody else
handle the sale, be my guest.

533
00:30:17,382 --> 00:30:19,407
I warn you, there's a lot
of corruption out there.

534
00:30:19,551 --> 00:30:23,715
- And why should I trust you?
- This is a family-operated business.

535
00:30:23,855 --> 00:30:27,120
We have survived for nearly a hundred
years because of our reputation

536
00:30:27,258 --> 00:30:28,555
and the quality of our work.

537
00:30:28,693 --> 00:30:32,026
You know, the guy I was talking to when
you came in, he will allow no one else

538
00:30:32,163 --> 00:30:34,222
to even go near his instruments.

539
00:30:34,365 --> 00:30:36,196
Is he the one who called
about the Stainer?

540
00:30:36,334 --> 00:30:37,699
Stainer? No.

541
00:30:37,836 --> 00:30:40,498
No, the buyer I have in mind
for your violin is a musician.

542
00:30:40,638 --> 00:30:44,039
The other guy has one of the largest
privately owned string collections

543
00:30:44,175 --> 00:30:47,633
in the world. No one knows exactly
what he's got or how he's got them.

544
00:30:49,013 --> 00:30:51,004
There's a rumor going around
that the Davidoff Strad

545
00:30:51,149 --> 00:30:54,380
is hidden away somewhere in his bedroom.
Supposedly, it was stolen

546
00:30:54,519 --> 00:30:57,454
- from some virtuoso's Manhattan...
- Who exactly is this guy?

547
00:30:57,589 --> 00:31:00,820
Uh, somebody who appreciates
my discretion.

548
00:31:01,559 --> 00:31:05,962
Now, if you'd feel more comfortable,
I can have the photos I took

549
00:31:06,097 --> 00:31:08,224
sent to a colleague
for a second opinion.

550
00:31:08,366 --> 00:31:10,527
And I'd appreciate it if you didn't
sell it in the meantime

551
00:31:10,668 --> 00:31:15,401
and I'm happy to give you
a ten percent deposit in good faith.

552
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:16,666
Uh...

553
00:31:17,308 --> 00:31:18,297
What is the owner's name?

554
00:31:18,443 --> 00:31:21,810
It's not easy for him
to get to the bank, he...

555
00:31:21,946 --> 00:31:23,777
Uh... He prefers cash.

556
00:31:40,231 --> 00:31:41,459
Shane!

557
00:31:46,271 --> 00:31:48,501
Hey, Shane!

558
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:51,268
Shane, open the door!

559
00:31:51,409 --> 00:31:54,173
I'd get out of here if I were you,
my mom's really pissed.

560
00:31:54,312 --> 00:31:56,212
- What?
- Shane, get out the way.

561
00:31:56,948 --> 00:31:58,575
What the hell is goin' on?

562
00:31:59,918 --> 00:32:01,510
Maybe I should ask you
the same question.

563
00:32:01,653 --> 00:32:04,884
Is there anything that you feel like
you need to tell me?

564
00:32:07,492 --> 00:32:09,460
- What are you talking about?
- Um...

565
00:32:09,594 --> 00:32:13,325
Anything happen at the convention
that's interesting? Like...

566
00:32:15,767 --> 00:32:19,225
- Did you meet a woman?
- Oh, God. You've been...

567
00:32:20,171 --> 00:32:21,866
You've been talkin'
to Judy Vandenhoevel.

568
00:32:22,006 --> 00:32:23,268
She's... she's full of crap.

569
00:32:23,408 --> 00:32:26,775
That woman she's talking about
happens to be a customer.

570
00:32:26,911 --> 00:32:30,870
Um, the assistant manager
was kind enough to send us this.

571
00:32:31,015 --> 00:32:33,882
And I don't even wanna think
about how your customer's earring

572
00:32:34,018 --> 00:32:38,819
- ended up in your hotel room.
- (STAMMERS) That... She...

573
00:32:38,957 --> 00:32:40,822
- You know, nothing happened.
- (SIGHING)

574
00:32:40,959 --> 00:32:43,450
Come on, Jo Ann. I was robbed!

575
00:32:45,229 --> 00:32:46,423
I want you gone.

576
00:32:48,366 --> 00:32:49,697
I mean it this time.

577
00:32:57,909 --> 00:32:59,103
(DOOR OPENING)

578
00:32:59,243 --> 00:33:02,144
Oh, hey. Wow. You're here late.

579
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:07,013
I was just swingin' by to drop off some
of these policy forms for you to sign.

580
00:33:07,151 --> 00:33:09,949
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Great. Thank you.

581
00:33:10,088 --> 00:33:13,683
I actually, uh... you don't have to
drive all the way out here for these.

582
00:33:13,825 --> 00:33:16,817
You can always just...
fake my signature,

583
00:33:16,961 --> 00:33:19,691
and that way you can turn 'em in
to the home office yourself.

584
00:33:19,831 --> 00:33:21,321
Oh, hey. I wanted to tell ya,

585
00:33:21,466 --> 00:33:25,368
I had a terrific meeting with the
manager over at Jimmy's Wholesale.

586
00:33:25,503 --> 00:33:29,906
And I bumped into Gorvy and Frank,
they were buying groceries.

587
00:33:30,041 --> 00:33:31,838
You know, I didn't realize
that Gorvy had actually

588
00:33:31,976 --> 00:33:33,466
gone ahead and bought himself a policy.

589
00:33:33,611 --> 00:33:36,444
Oh, yeah. Just a small little package.

590
00:33:36,581 --> 00:33:39,414
I'll let you know when the commission
comes in. It's nothing.

591
00:33:39,550 --> 00:33:43,008
Oh, well, you know, I was just happy
he got himself some coverage.

592
00:33:43,154 --> 00:33:46,555
You know, I was worried about him,
out there, all alone.

593
00:33:46,691 --> 00:33:50,422
Yeah. He's not alone. He's got a dog.
(CHUCKLES)

594
00:33:51,562 --> 00:33:54,531
God, that dog.
What am I gonna do about that dog?

595
00:33:54,665 --> 00:33:55,689
You don't like him either?

596
00:33:57,602 --> 00:34:01,060
Uh... His sister's sick, she had a stroke.

597
00:34:01,205 --> 00:34:03,173
So he's gonna go out
to Rhinelander to visit her

598
00:34:03,307 --> 00:34:05,036
and he doesn't know
what to do with the dog.

599
00:34:05,877 --> 00:34:08,209
Oh, so the dog's gotta be sent away?

600
00:34:08,346 --> 00:34:11,247
Well, I would take him,
but my wife's allergic.

601
00:34:11,382 --> 00:34:14,112
And it seems that Frank's gotta go
on a big trip to Idaho.

602
00:34:14,252 --> 00:34:16,914
- So I don't know.
- I got a client who's got a kennel.

603
00:34:17,055 --> 00:34:20,081
- I'll call him.
- You would?

604
00:35:10,908 --> 00:35:11,897
(SIGHS)

605
00:35:13,911 --> 00:35:15,708
MICKEY: <i>Come on, Gorvy.</i>
<i>You're gonna miss your bus.</i>

606
00:35:17,048 --> 00:35:19,744
They're gonna be waitin'
at the kennel for Pete.

607
00:35:19,884 --> 00:35:21,715
I need my lozenges.

608
00:35:21,853 --> 00:35:24,481
- Yeah, you don't wanna forget those.
- Yeah, yeah.

609
00:35:24,622 --> 00:35:28,388
(CHUCKLING) Look at him,
he doesn't want to leave the violin.

610
00:35:28,526 --> 00:35:32,018
- Hey, where are you goin' with that?
- I'll hide it upstairs.

611
00:35:37,068 --> 00:35:38,092
May I help you?

612
00:35:38,236 --> 00:35:40,363
Yeah. I'm here to finish installing
the security system.

613
00:35:40,505 --> 00:35:42,871
I brought the other keypad
the guy wanted.

614
00:35:43,007 --> 00:35:46,636
No. No, I think you may have to
come back. We're actually just leaving.

615
00:35:46,777 --> 00:35:49,211
No, no. It'll be fine.
It'll only take a second.

616
00:36:03,361 --> 00:36:06,228
- (THUDDING UPSTAIRS)
- (TOOLS WHIRRING)

617
00:36:06,364 --> 00:36:10,357
Gorvy? Why is there a guy down here
puttin' in an alarm system?

618
00:36:10,501 --> 00:36:12,093
When'd you decide to do that?

619
00:36:13,171 --> 00:36:16,299
I saw your friend, Bob,
at the supermarket the other day.

620
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:19,637
He said if I put in an alarm system
my rates would go down.

621
00:36:20,945 --> 00:36:24,073
- Why? Is he here?
MICKEY: Yes.

622
00:36:24,215 --> 00:36:25,409
GORVY: Oh.

623
00:36:26,017 --> 00:36:30,249
Alarm guy, will this go right through
to the police when it's hooked up?

624
00:36:30,388 --> 00:36:34,882
Uh, yeah. It's connected
straight to the station.

625
00:36:38,229 --> 00:36:42,666
I, um... I left my screwdriver somewhere
around here when I installed it...

626
00:36:43,734 --> 00:36:45,702
- Thanks for your help.
MAN: Yeah, I'll set my number

627
00:36:45,836 --> 00:36:47,770
by the front door
in case you need it, OK?

628
00:36:48,639 --> 00:36:50,300
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

629
00:36:50,441 --> 00:36:52,466
- Did we put in the numbers?
- Yeah.

630
00:36:52,610 --> 00:36:55,204
And once you press in the number,
you got three minutes to leave the house.

631
00:36:55,346 --> 00:36:58,782
OK. Now, let's come on.
We got to go.

632
00:36:58,916 --> 00:37:00,679
- You want me to punch it in now?
- Yeah.

633
00:37:00,818 --> 00:37:04,777
I have to catch a bus.
Petey, come on. Come. Good dog.

634
00:37:04,922 --> 00:37:06,583
Warm up the car.

635
00:37:07,792 --> 00:37:09,783
(KEYPAD BEEPING)

636
00:37:50,801 --> 00:37:52,769
Hi, we're havin' some trouble
with this alarm.

637
00:38:02,313 --> 00:38:03,439
Hey, there.

638
00:38:06,684 --> 00:38:10,347
Hey. What's the, uh...
what's the problem with the alarm?

639
00:38:10,488 --> 00:38:13,980
Oh, no problem. I just need you to turn
it off so I can get inside real quick.

640
00:38:14,692 --> 00:38:16,819
It's OK, I'm friends with the owner.

641
00:38:17,561 --> 00:38:19,825
Left some insurance paperwork in there.

642
00:38:19,964 --> 00:38:23,627
Gotta turn in Mr. Hauer's policy
or it'll lapse.

643
00:38:24,101 --> 00:38:25,193
Oh.

644
00:38:26,671 --> 00:38:28,104
- Yeah.
- Huh.

645
00:38:29,206 --> 00:38:32,835
You know, uh...
anyone can print these up.

646
00:38:33,444 --> 00:38:36,140
- N... You met me earlier.
- Hm-hm.

I left you a note about all this.

Anyway, there was an appraisal
of this violin.

887

Figured I'd let Gorvy know as soon
as I... as soon as I found out.

And, you know, his sister...

...his sister passed, which is, um...
Oh, my God, rest her soul.

But this... this news certainly
seemed to cheer Gorvy up a bit.

00:56:12,736 --> 00:56:15,728
Look, I did all the paperwork.
It's all taken care of.

for its full value.

- So you turned that in?
- Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

for Aruba.

- A million dollars? What do you mean?
- A million point two-five.

That's what the appraisal
put the market value at.

- You should've called me immediately.

the full appraisal.

01:00:31,561 --> 01:00:34,655
You're firing me? I...

972
01:00:35,598 --> 01:00:38,590
I left another job to...
to come work with you.

973
01:00:38,735 --> 01:00:40,635
- Yeah.
- I mean, I thought I was

974
01:00:40,770 --> 01:00:42,431
actually doing a pretty good job, too.

975
01:00:42,572 --> 01:00:46,030
Yeah, I know. It's the damndest thing.
I mean, it's, uh...

976
01:00:46,643 --> 01:00:49,806
I don't know. I don't know what to do,
he's been with me a long time.

977
01:00:51,147 --> 01:00:53,547
That's pretty unexpected. I...

978
01:00:53,683 --> 01:00:55,014
I don't know what
I'm gonna tell my wife.

979
01:00:55,151 --> 01:00:58,643
Well, look, I'll be happy to write
you a recommendation. OK?

980
01:00:58,788 --> 01:01:01,450
I'm sure Phil Peters would be happy
to have you back on board.

981
01:01:02,692 --> 01:01:04,819
- Thanks, Mickey. Thank you.
- Yeah.

982
01:01:04,961 --> 01:01:09,193
I'd like to stay in touch. And I'd like
to hear about Gorvy and his violin.

983
01:01:10,333 --> 01:01:13,734
I actually sent someone out today
to see if they could loan it out.

986
01:01:44,801 --> 01:01:45,790
Gorvy?

987
01:01:45,935 --> 01:01:49,029
- I thought you were my friend.
- What's wrong? What's the matter?

988
01:01:49,172 --> 01:01:50,161
I am your friend.

989
01:01:51,574 --> 01:01:53,235
A man came to look at the violin.

990
01:01:53,376 --> 01:01:56,140
He says it's not old,
it's not from Austria.

991
01:01:56,279 --> 01:01:58,247
It's from China, from some factory.

992
01:01:58,381 --> 01:02:01,214
He could tell by looking at size of holes.

993
01:02:01,350 --> 01:02:04,217
- Oh.
- I paid good money for insurance policy.

994
01:02:04,353 --> 01:02:06,617
Now Bob tells me
I have to pay even more.

995
01:02:06,756 --> 01:02:09,384
Bob's gone. I let him go.

996
01:02:09,525 --> 01:02:13,086
OK? And you're gonna get a full refund
on your premium.

997
01:02:14,630 --> 01:02:16,928
We were gonna go to Europe,
me and Petey.

998
01:02:17,066 --> 01:02:20,126
We were gonna show this
to famous people, let them play it.

999
01:02:20,269 --> 01:02:21,759
Now we can't go anywhere.

1000
01:02:21,904 --> 01:02:24,270
Well, you can still play it for Petey.

1001
01:02:24,407 --> 01:02:26,807
Right? I mean,
he loves that thing. Pete.

- Petey, Pete. Hey. (WHISTLES)

1003
01:02:30,012 --> 01:02:31,604

1004
01:02:31,748 --> 01:02:33,113
now he won't even look at it.

1005
01:02:33,249 --> 01:02:35,274

- Come on.

No, no.

1009
01:02:44,894 --> 01:02:46,623
There's no teeth marks in this.

1010
01:02:47,296 --> 01:02:50,629
No teeth marks. Petey has big teeth.
He would leave teeth marks in this.

1011
01:02:50,767 --> 01:02:52,200
And there's none.

1012
01:02:52,702 --> 01:02:54,465
I don't think this is my violin.

- (PETEY WHINING, BARKING)
- He... he's gotta go outside.

1014
01:03:05,615 --> 01:03:07,879
Someone took my violin
while I was gone.

1015
01:03:08,017 --> 01:03:09,951
They took my clock, too.

1016
01:03:10,086 --> 01:03:12,748
Gorvy, you're...
you're watching too much TV.

1017
01:03:12,889 --> 01:03:15,289
I'm going outside
to wait for the police.

1018
01:03:15,424 --> 01:03:17,824

- Yeah, they're on their way.

1023
01:03:51,661 --> 01:03:54,221
that you had some kind of theft
out here.

1024
01:03:55,398 --> 01:03:58,629
Excuse me, is this, uh...
is this the violin he called us about?

1025
01:03:59,168 --> 01:04:01,898
Uh...
What did... what did he say?

1026
01:04:02,038 --> 01:04:06,338
Uh, according to Mr. Hauer, this one...

1027
01:04:06,475 --> 01:04:08,466
...this one is not his.

1028
01:04:08,611 --> 01:04:12,672
Apparently, the one he owns
is quote unquote, "famous."

1029
01:04:12,815 --> 01:04:16,512
(CHUCKLES) Well, I don't know
anything about that. He's pretty old.

1030
01:04:16,652 --> 01:04:21,089
Well, I don't either, but, uh... I have to
take this back to the station with me.

1031
01:04:21,224 --> 01:04:26,787
So, uh... did you or did he
see any signs of forced entry?

1032
01:04:26,929 --> 01:04:30,126
- No.
- Or was there anything else missing?

1033
01:04:30,266 --> 01:04:32,928
- No, he's...
- Uh, anything else out of place?

1034
01:04:33,069 --> 01:04:34,661
- No?
- He's... he's, uh...

1035

Doesn't even lock the doors here.

1036
01:04:36,172 --> 01:04:37,366
Well, I see he got
a security system, though.

1037
01:04:37,506 --> 01:04:40,134
Yeah, he never sets it.
He's a pretty congenial guy.

1038
01:04:40,276 --> 01:04:41,504
- People come and go here.
- OK.

1039
01:04:41,644 --> 01:04:44,738
He's... a nice, old fella.

1040

- And you are?
- Mickey Prohaska.

I'm a friend of the family, actually.

1042
01:04:50,620 --> 01:04:53,953
He, uh... Give you my card. He'd probably
wanna run this thing through me.

1043

- He's pretty senile.
- Prohaska... insurance?

- They left.
- Call 'em back!

- No, they can't help you.

01:21:18,874 --> 01:21:20,341
Why would you get a meat delivery?

1287
01:21:20,475 --> 01:21:23,137
We wouldn't.
We just got a fire back here.

1288
01:21:39,761 --> 01:21:42,628
MICKEY: <i>In the time it took</i>
<i>to knock back a drink,</i>

1289
01:21:42,764 --> 01:21:44,959
<i>a dead man came back to life.</i>

1290
01:21:52,507 --> 01:21:55,840
<i>Remember, I said to believe</i>
<i>only half of what you see?</i>

1291
01:21:55,977 --> 01:21:57,205
Here.

1292
01:21:57,979 --> 01:21:59,742
- Drink up, buddy.
- <i>Well, they had to make sure</i>

1293
01:21:59,881 --> 01:22:02,281
<i>the other half wouldn't be seen at all.</i>

1294
01:22:03,885 --> 01:22:05,785
<i>But let me back up.</i>

1295
01:22:05,921 --> 01:22:11,052
- <i>First, they had to hook the guy.</i>
- Oh, look. I do have a violin.

1296
01:22:11,192 --> 01:22:12,591
<i>And then there was the blackmail</i>
<i>they developed</i>

1297
01:22:13,561 --> 01:22:16,086
<i>just to make sure their lead</i>
<i>would be followed.</i>

1298
01:22:18,400 --> 01:22:20,368
<i>And they timed it out perfectly.</i>

1299
01:22:20,502 --> 01:22:23,130
KARLA: Mickey, I have
some forms for you to sign.

1300
01:22:24,506 --> 01:22:28,306
MICKEY: <i>Once they got what they wanted,</i>
<i>the next step was the blow-off.</i>

1301
01:22:29,344 --> 01:22:31,312
Excuse me, do you have the time?

1302
01:22:32,414 --> 01:22:34,439
<i>Oldest opening line in the book.</i>

1303
01:22:34,582 --> 01:22:38,018
<i>Remember? Never fails</i>
<i>to get someone's attention.</i>

1304
01:22:38,153 --> 01:22:41,645
<i>When a guy is spooked that bad,</i>
<i>he feels lucky just to walk away.</i>

1305
01:22:44,059 --> 01:22:46,493
I need to find out about an account
that was opened up here.

1306
01:22:46,628 --> 01:22:48,994
- Hi. I'll take this one, Anna.
- Hi.

1307
01:22:49,130 --> 01:22:51,997
We're still finding pennies
in the strangest places.

1308
01:22:52,133 --> 01:22:55,159
But don't worry, we're adding them
to your account, Mr. Hauer.

1309
01:22:56,972 --> 01:23:00,567
MICKEY: <i>The old man made sure to stay</i>
<i>on the sidelines and let somebody else</i>

1310
01:23:00,709 --> 01:23:04,076
<i>get stuck holding the bag, literally.</i>

1311
01:23:04,679 --> 01:23:07,113
<i>They needed an agent</i>
<i>to push the claim through</i>

1312
01:23:07,248 --> 01:23:09,842
<i>and take the fall if their scam</i>
<i>was discovered.</i>

1313
01:23:09,985 --> 01:23:12,453
<i>You could say</i>
<i>he was their insurance policy.</i>

1314
01:23:12,587 --> 01:23:14,555
KARLA: And I'm here doing work.

1315
01:23:15,724 --> 01:23:19,592
I've been recycling.
Look what almost got thrown out.

1316
01:23:19,728 --> 01:23:23,061
A violin label. I got a call
about the traveler's checks

1317
01:23:23,198 --> 01:23:24,927
that were bought
with your credit cards.

1318
01:23:25,066 --> 01:23:27,967
They were able to trace the serial
numbers and they were deposited

1319
01:23:28,103 --> 01:23:30,663
in a bank in Burlington.

1320
01:23:31,139 --> 01:23:34,540
They opened the account that paid
the premium on this policy, right?

1321
01:23:34,676 --> 01:23:36,906
I know what you're thinking, Karla,
and it's not what it looks like.

1322
01:23:37,045 --> 01:23:39,707
I thought that Golden Harvest
sounded familiar.

1323
01:23:40,615 --> 01:23:42,981
It was who the big payout
went to for the violin, wasn't it?

1324
01:23:43,118 --> 01:23:44,551
I was duped by this...

1325
01:23:45,086 --> 01:23:47,577
...this Gorvy Hauer son of a bitch!

1326
01:23:47,722 --> 01:23:49,553
If that's even his name!

1327
01:23:49,691 --> 01:23:52,091
- No, his name is Mickey Prohaska.
- No.

1328
01:23:52,227 --> 01:23:54,991
You took out insurance
in someone else's name

1329
01:23:55,130 --> 01:23:58,293
on a violin that, hm...
conveniently went missing.

1330
01:23:58,433 --> 01:24:01,891
Karla, you gotta believe me.

1331
01:24:02,037 --> 01:24:05,006
Why? You lie all the time.

1332
01:24:05,874 --> 01:24:07,842
You're good, Mickey.

1333
01:24:09,244 --> 01:24:11,178
Winning little awards.

1334
01:24:11,880 --> 01:24:15,543
Building your reputation at the company
so your word there would be credible.

1335
01:24:15,683 --> 01:24:18,914
All to make this one big payout
seem legit.

1336
01:24:20,422 --> 01:24:22,287
Where are you hiding
the money, Mickey?

1337
01:24:22,424 --> 01:24:24,892
You can't just
make $1,000,000 disappear.

1338
01:24:25,026 --> 01:24:28,291
MICKEY: <i>But they did. They bought</i>
<i>something that couldn't be traced.</i>

1339
01:24:28,430 --> 01:24:32,457
There's a lot of money in corn, Mickey.
It's worth its weight in gold.

1340
01:24:32,600 --> 01:24:34,192
MICKEY: <i>Feed corn.</i>

1341
01:24:35,336 --> 01:24:37,497
<i>Once the insurance settlement</i>
<i>hit the bank,</i>

1342
01:24:37,639 --> 01:24:40,199
<i>it was wired out</i>
<i>to a dozen grain elevators</i>

1343
01:24:40,341 --> 01:24:43,469
<i>and sold to farmers</i>
<i>in amounts under $ 10,000.</i>

1344
01:24:43,611 --> 01:24:46,239
<i>Money laundering. Midwestern style.</i>

1345
01:24:46,948 --> 01:24:48,108
(MOOING)

1346
01:24:49,417 --> 01:24:52,215
<i>The entire operation was financed</i>
<i>with some credit cards</i>

1347
01:24:52,353 --> 01:24:55,117
<i>that were temporarily borrowed</i>
<i>by one of their bit players.</i>

1348
01:24:57,258 --> 01:25:00,250
<i>Everyone deserves a nice</i>
<i>little getaway, don't they?</i>

1349
01:25:00,395 --> 01:25:02,727
<i>Especially after a job well done.</i>

1350
01:25:02,864 --> 01:25:05,697
<i>(CHUCKLES) Even the goddamn dog.</i>

1351
01:25:06,634 --> 01:25:08,067
<i>How do you like that?</i>

1352
01:25:08,203 --> 01:25:12,003
<i>A dog that was never lost,</i>
<i>sought by a man who didn't exist.</i>

1353
01:25:12,140 --> 01:25:15,974
Come here. Let me have five bucks
worth of tickets for tonight's lottery

1354
01:25:16,111 --> 01:25:17,601
and a pack of Winston's, please.

1355
01:25:17,745 --> 01:25:20,805
MICKEY: <i>At least not in the form</i>
<i>of an absent-minded farmer.</i>

1356
01:25:20,949 --> 01:25:24,407
<i>Odds are, he was the brains</i>
<i>behind it all.</i>

1357
01:25:31,092 --> 01:25:33,060
This guy's on a serious losing streak.

1358
01:25:35,630 --> 01:25:37,621
KARLA: <i>If you expect me</i>
<i>to keep quiet, Mickey,</i>

1359
01:25:37,765 --> 01:25:39,198
<i>you're gonna have to give me your car.</i>

1360
01:25:40,301 --> 01:25:41,996
Or I'm gonna call Glen.

1361
01:25:42,770 --> 01:25:44,965
I'm about to take
my state licensing exam.

1362
01:25:45,507 --> 01:25:47,907
I can't make sales calls
in this piece of shit.

1363
01:25:48,042 --> 01:25:50,476
I should have let you quit
when I had the chance.

1364
01:25:53,548 --> 01:25:56,210
I'm done with
the insurance business, Glen.

1365
01:25:56,985 --> 01:25:57,974
What are you gonna do?

1366
01:25:59,787 --> 01:26:00,981
Head south.

1367
01:26:01,523 --> 01:26:03,855
<i>I've had it with these goddamn winters.</i>

1368
01:26:03,992 --> 01:26:05,118
Hey, Phil.

1369
01:26:05,260 --> 01:26:06,284
Hey.

1370
01:26:06,427 --> 01:26:09,555
Never got a chance
to congratulate you on that sales award.

1371
01:26:09,697 --> 01:26:12,393
- Oh, thanks. Thanks a lot.
- I'm sure you'll take top prize again

1372
01:26:12,534 --> 01:26:15,401
in Aruba, even without Bob Egan.

1373
01:26:15,537 --> 01:26:16,595
Who?

1374
01:26:17,972 --> 01:26:21,339
Bob. The guy from the convention.
You were gonna hire him.

1375
01:26:21,476 --> 01:26:25,378
I wasn't gonna hire anybody there.
I got six guys working for me already.

1376
01:26:27,749 --> 01:26:31,378
MICKEY: <i>Turns out there was a top</i>
<i>salesman even better than Phil Peters.</i>

1377
01:26:31,519 --> 01:26:34,488
Hey, just wanted to say,
love the suit.

1378
01:26:34,622 --> 01:26:36,749
- Oh, thanks. Thanks.
- All right, take care.

1379
01:26:36,891 --> 01:26:40,122
MICKEY: <i>He was the roper.</i>
<i>But that wasn't his only role.</i>

1380
01:26:40,261 --> 01:26:44,095
Hey, that's a nice car.
It's easy to spot.

1381
01:26:44,232 --> 01:26:45,699
MICKEY: <i>He was also the tail.</i>

1382
01:26:48,636 --> 01:26:51,628
<i>He knew when the office would be empty</i>
<i>and he had full access</i>

1383
01:26:51,773 --> 01:26:53,866
<i>to all the amenities inside.</i>

1384
01:26:54,742 --> 01:26:57,267
<i>The entire time, he slipped by unnoticed.</i>

1385
01:27:00,281 --> 01:27:04,445
<i>One and a quarter million dollars.</i>
<i>Not a bad severance package.</i>

1386
01:27:04,586 --> 01:27:08,317
<i>Even if it was split five ways.</i>
<i>That's right.</i>

1387
01:27:08,456 --> 01:27:10,890
<i>Remember the good faith deposit?</i>

1388
01:27:11,025 --> 01:27:14,722
<i>It's what's known</i>
<i>in a scam as the convincer.</i>

1389
01:27:14,862 --> 01:27:17,228
<i>A little taste of bigger riches to come.</i>

1390
01:27:17,365 --> 01:27:21,301
<i>For a desperate sucker,</i>
<i>it's the ultimate form of persuasion.</i>

1391
01:27:22,503 --> 01:27:23,629
How much did they pay you?

1392
01:27:23,771 --> 01:27:25,466
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

1393
01:27:25,607 --> 01:27:28,132
- This is private property and I'm...
- How much did they pay you?

1394
01:27:28,276 --> 01:27:30,972
You think I'm not gonna fuckin' turn you
in for tryin' to pass off a fake violin

1395
01:27:31,112 --> 01:27:32,773
- to an insurance company?
- 'Cause I don't think

1396
01:27:32,914 --> 01:27:35,644
you'd get anywhere with that.
I gave you an appraisal, not a contract.

1397
01:27:35,783 --> 01:27:38,752
An appraisal's considered an opinion.
I gave you my opinion. (GRUNTING)

1398
01:27:41,122 --> 01:27:43,454
Now it's gone
and nobody knows where it is.

1399
01:27:43,591 --> 01:27:45,582
And there's a lot
of corruption out there.

1400
01:27:54,035 --> 01:27:56,094
MAN: <i>So the violin was worthless</i>
<i>from the beginning?</i>

1401
01:27:56,804 --> 01:27:59,932
Beware of anything
with strings attached.

1402
01:28:00,074 --> 01:28:03,407
- Yeah, my friend got duped.
- Ah, poor bastard.

1403
01:28:03,544 --> 01:28:06,809
- Whatever happened to him?
- Luckily, he made a clean start.

1404
01:28:06,948 --> 01:28:10,315
- Got away to someplace warm.
- Yeah, well, don't tell me about weather.

1405
01:28:10,451 --> 01:28:11,884
- I'm from Chicago.
- Oh.

1406
01:28:12,020 --> 01:28:14,818
We got nine months of winter and
then three months of hell. (LAUGHS)

1407
01:28:14,956 --> 01:28:18,517
Too bad they stuck you at this place.
Nickel and dime you to death.

1408
01:28:18,660 --> 01:28:21,288
Yeah, tell me about it.
Six bucks for a beer.

1409
01:28:21,429 --> 01:28:24,523
Wait till you see the bill.
They tack on a resort fee.

1410
01:28:24,666 --> 01:28:27,965
All for a tiny room, paper-thin walls
and a rock-hard mattress.

1411
01:28:28,102 --> 01:28:29,899
Might as well be sleepin'
in a cardboard box.

1412
01:28:30,038 --> 01:28:31,027
Right.

1413
01:28:33,808 --> 01:28:37,300
You know, I know a place
just a couple miles down the road.

1414
01:28:37,445 --> 01:28:38,434
Take a look at that.

1415
01:28:41,316 --> 01:28:44,251
- What is this, a time share?
- It's an opportunity.

1416
01:28:44,385 --> 01:28:46,580
Own a little piece
of the sunshine state.

1417
01:28:47,188 --> 01:28:49,349
I can probably get you into an
all-you-can-eat buffet for free

1418
01:28:49,490 --> 01:28:52,459
- just by comin' by.
- I'm flyin' back home tomorrow.

1419
01:28:52,593 --> 01:28:54,493
- What time's your flight?
- 4:30.

1420
01:28:54,629 --> 01:28:57,860
Oh! Terrific. They're gonna make you
check out of the room at noon.

1421
01:28:57,999 --> 01:29:00,263
I'll pick you up,
take you over there myself.

1422
01:29:00,401 --> 01:29:02,335
- I don't know.
- You gotta eat.

1423
01:29:03,037 --> 01:29:05,096
I mean, this restaurant
will charge you an arm and a leg.

1424
01:29:11,279 --> 01:29:12,712
Sure. (CHUCKLES)

1425
01:29:12,847 --> 01:29:15,372
- What the hell. (LAUGHS)
- OK.

1426
01:29:15,516 --> 01:29:18,041
All right, I'll pick you up
in the lobby at 11:00...

1427
01:29:18,186 --> 01:29:19,210
- Jerry.
- Jerry.

1428
01:29:19,354 --> 01:29:20,878
- I'm gonna take this.
- Yeah.

1429
01:29:29,297 --> 01:29:32,130
