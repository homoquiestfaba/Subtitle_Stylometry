00:00:54,616 --> 00:00:58,112
<font color=#ffff00><i>The Wailing Wall, Jerusalem.
1934</i></font>

00:01:30,723 --> 00:01:32,103
<font color=#ffff00><i>He said four minutes precisely.</i></font>

3
00:01:47,379 --> 00:01:48,379
<font color=#ffff00>Quickly, move.</font>

4
00:02:02,134 --> 00:02:04,661
<font color=#ffff00>Two perfect eggs this time, no?</font>

5
00:02:22,621 --> 00:02:23,979
<font color=#ffff00>Maybe.</font>

6
00:02:28,448 --> 00:02:29,684
<font color=#ffff00>I blame the chicken.</font>

7
00:02:30,545 --> 00:02:32,225
<font color=#ffff00>Why do hens lay eggs
of different sizes.</font>

8
00:02:32,499 --> 00:02:35,209
<font color=#ffff00>It's not you, " Mon'Amie."
These are two perfectly cooked eggs.</font>

9
00:02:35,522 --> 00:02:36,522
<font color=#ffff00>Mr. Poirot...</font>

10
00:02:36,602 --> 00:02:38,042
<font color=#ffff00>I have got 3 religions bent on riot.</font>

11
00:02:38,321 --> 00:02:40,921
<font color=#ffff00>If you are going to perform one of
your miracles, the time is now.</font>

12
00:02:43,071 --> 00:02:45,616
<font color=#ffff00>Have the eggs.</font>

13
00:02:54,143 --> 00:02:55,562
<font color=#ffff00>Poirot!</font>

14
00:02:57,219 --> 00:02:59,427
<font color=#ffff00>Sorry for the, um...</font>

15
00:03:03,007 --> 00:03:04,678
<font color=#ffff00>It is not the...</font>

16
00:03:06,045 --> 00:03:09,194
<font color=#ffff00>It is the imbalance of the...</font>

17
00:03:16,682 --> 00:03:17,682
<font color=#ffff00>Right.</font>

18
00:03:17,869 --> 00:03:18,917
<font color=#ffff00>That's better.</font>

19
00:03:19,275 --> 00:03:21,406
<font color=#ffff00><i>Excuse me. Let's move on
Make way, please.</i></font>

20
00:03:23,067 --> 00:03:24,147
<font color=#ffff00>For the accused.</font>

21
00:03:25,457 --> 00:03:26,729
<font color=#ffff00>The rabbi...</font>

22
00:03:27,818 --> 00:03:29,090
<font color=#ffff00>the priest...</font>

23
00:03:30,065 --> 00:03:31,370
<font color=#ffff00>and the Imam.</font>

24
00:03:33,508 --> 00:03:36,348
<font color=#ffff00>It is like the...
old joke, yes?</font>

25
00:03:36,511 --> 00:03:38,570
<font color=#ffff00>The rabbi, the priest and the imam.</font>

26
00:03:41,437 --> 00:03:43,384
<font color=#ffff00>Forgive me, I'm Belgian.</font>

27
00:03:43,562 --> 00:03:45,121
<font color=#ffff00>So, let us begin.</font>

28
00:03:47,048 --> 00:03:49,719
<font color=#ffff00>In the church of the
Holy Sepulcher above us!</font>

29
00:03:49,886 --> 00:03:52,576
<font color=#ffff00><i>Three representatives meet
under the supervision...</i></font>

30
00:03:52,842 --> 00:03:57,497
<font color=#ffff00><i>of the Chief Inspector of the Police to
discuss a divided timetable for market use.</i></font>

31
00:03:58,402 --> 00:04:00,066
<font color=#ffff00><i>One hour after this tense meeting...</i></font>

32
00:04:00,343 --> 00:04:03,182
<font color=#ffff00><i>a priceless relic is found to be stolen.</i></font>

33
00:04:04,201 --> 00:04:09,842
<font color=#ffff00>It is said one of
these three men has stolen it.</font>

34
00:04:10,067 --> 00:04:13,706
<font color=#ffff00>The police find no pieces
of evidence at all.</font>

35
00:04:13,917 --> 00:04:16,426
<font color=#ffff00>I find one.</font>

36
00:04:16,738 --> 00:04:21,188
<font color=#ffff00><i>On the meticulously well
kept wall of a fresco...</i></font>

37
00:04:21,501 --> 00:04:26,138
<font color=#ffff00><i>a single crack from an
indelicate client..</i></font>

38
00:04:26,178 --> 00:04:30,645
<font color=#ffff00><i>With a hard-soled
shoe or perhaps a boot.</i></font>

39
00:04:35,594 --> 00:04:38,097
<font color=#ffff00>So, ladies and gentlemen,
we must ask...</font>

40
00:04:38,301 --> 00:04:41,111
<font color=#ffff00>Who stands to benefit from the crime?</font>

41
00:04:42,985 --> 00:04:45,729
<font color=#ffff00>Our three holy men live humbly.</font>

42
00:04:46,772 --> 00:04:49,246
<font color=#ffff00>They have thin
soled shoes, poor.</font>

43
00:04:49,994 --> 00:04:54,625
<font color=#ffff00>Sudden riches
and rubies would be...</font>

44
00:04:54,813 --> 00:04:57,533
<font color=#ffff00>too conspicuous, yes? To enjoy,
they do not getting it.</font>

45
00:04:57,746 --> 00:05:00,362
<font color=#ffff00>At this point, we need, an armed
guard at the south gate,</font>

46
00:05:01,093 --> 00:05:02,555
<font color=#ffff00>Thank you very much.</font>

47
00:05:02,858 --> 00:05:04,000
<font color=#ffff00>Now, the only one...</font>

48
00:05:04,238 --> 00:05:08,809
<font color=#ffff00>who benefits from the theft
and the unrest it causes...</font>

49
00:05:09,001 --> 00:05:12,463
<font color=#ffff00>is a man whose office I
had searched this morning...</font>

50
00:05:12,702 --> 00:05:15,582
<font color=#ffff00>As I waited, I have to tell you,
rather disappointed upon my breakfast.</font>

51
00:05:15,817 --> 00:05:18,044
<font color=#ffff00>Difficulty with the eggs.
You don't need to know this.</font>

52
00:05:18,307 --> 00:05:21,553
<font color=#ffff00>A man who is paid lavishly
to keep order in Jerusalem.</font>

53
00:05:21,809 --> 00:05:25,838
<font color=#ffff00>I mean, of course, the
Chief Inspector of the Police.</font>

54
00:05:26,236 --> 00:05:28,437
<font color=#ffff00>A man who does not wish to
lose a well-paid post...</font>

55
00:05:28,706 --> 00:05:32,480
<font color=#ffff00>when there is discussion among the
local people of self governance...</font>

56
00:05:33,055 --> 00:05:37,530
<font color=#ffff00>who does wear boots, and
do I believe now does regret...</font>

57
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:40,510
<font color=#ffff00>inviting me to consult on this case.</font>

58
00:05:40,767 --> 00:05:42,409
<font color=#ffff00>How dare you accuse me?</font>

59
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:43,744
<font color=#ffff00>Police sergeant...</font>

60
00:05:44,713 --> 00:05:46,513
<font color=#ffff00>Did you search the
office as I asked?</font>

61
00:05:46,825 --> 00:05:47,825
<font color=#ffff00>Ah... Yes sir.</font>

62
00:05:48,015 --> 00:05:50,423
<font color=#ffff00>And did you find what
I said you might?</font>

63
00:05:50,618 --> 00:05:52,462
<font color=#ffff00>Yes sir. Just as you said.</font>

64
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:36,053
<font color=#ffff00><i>You must deliver that to the, captain.
It'll be the first thing in the morning.</i></font>

65
00:06:36,077 --> 00:06:37,077
<font color=#ffff00><i>I got it sir.</i></font>

66
00:06:38,113 --> 00:06:40,366
<font color=#ffff00>Luggage is on board, sir.</font>

67
00:06:41,065 --> 00:06:43,790
<font color=#ffff00>I want the right to
escort you to your boat.</font>

68
00:06:45,769 --> 00:06:50,115
<font color=#ffff00>To Istanbul, then?
Will you be back to London straight off?</font>

69
00:06:51,056 --> 00:06:55,715
<font color=#ffff00>I'm tired, and I've
earned myself a little holiday.</font>

70
00:06:55,945 --> 00:06:59,617
<font color=#ffff00>I want to look at paintings
and have too much time on my hands.</font>

71
00:07:01,249 --> 00:07:02,789
<font color=#ffff00>You're staring. Does it stop?</font>

72
00:07:03,774 --> 00:07:05,288
<font color=#ffff00>It's just...</font>

73
00:07:05,542 --> 00:07:09,121
<font color=#ffff00>How did you know it was him, sir?
From just a tiny crack on the wall.</font>

74
00:07:09,385 --> 00:07:11,750
<font color=#ffff00>I have the advantage...</font>

75
00:07:11,996 --> 00:07:14,644
<font color=#ffff00>I can only see the
world as it should be.</font>

76
00:07:14,978 --> 00:07:17,593
<font color=#ffff00>And when it is not,
the imperfection stands out...</font>

77
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:21,859
<font color=#ffff00>Like the nose in the
middle of a face.</font>

78
00:07:22,729 --> 00:07:25,046
<font color=#ffff00>It makes most of life unbearable.</font>

79
00:07:25,276 --> 00:07:29,438
<font color=#ffff00>But it is useful in the
detection of crime.</font>

80
00:07:29,742 --> 00:07:34,024
<font color=#ffff00>But it's just like you see 'em through their
hearts. And divine their true natures.</font>

81
00:07:34,249 --> 00:07:39,337
<font color=#ffff00>And whatever people say, there
is right there is wrong.</font>

82
00:07:39,576 --> 00:07:41,058
<font color=#ffff00>There is nothing in between.</font>

83
00:07:43,930 --> 00:07:45,120
<font color=#ffff00>We must part here.</font>

84
00:07:45,408 --> 00:07:47,088
<font color=#ffff00>No, sir, I am to escort you on ferry.</font>

85
00:07:49,127 --> 00:07:50,731
<font color=#ffff00>We must never meet again.</font>

86
00:07:50,902 --> 00:07:52,942
<font color=#ffff00>Could you straighten your tie please?
Just a little.</font>

87
00:07:52,969 --> 00:07:54,543
<font color=#ffff00>- Yes
- That is perfect.</font>

88
00:07:57,004 --> 00:07:58,595
<font color=#ffff00><i>Final passengers, please!</i></font>

89
00:08:00,866 --> 00:08:02,019
<font color=#ffff00>I am sorry.</font>

90
00:08:03,922 --> 00:08:05,810
<font color=#ffff00><i>We'll be reached soon.</i></font>

91
00:08:06,077 --> 00:08:07,437
<font color=#ffff00>But... Will it be fixed in time?</font>

92
00:08:07,564 --> 00:08:08,564
<font color=#ffff00><i>We are working!</i></font>

93
00:08:08,712 --> 00:08:12,960
<font color=#ffff00>I have a connection in Istanbul.
Leaves tomorrow at seven.</font>

94
00:08:13,152 --> 00:08:16,352
<font color=#ffff00>There is a very ill patient
waiting for me in London.</font>

95
00:08:17,949 --> 00:08:19,181
<font color=#ffff00>I'm a doctor.</font>

96
00:08:20,808 --> 00:08:21,955
<font color=#ffff00><i>Doctor.</i></font>

97
00:08:22,849 --> 00:08:24,357
<font color=#ffff00><i>I am a doctor.</i></font>

98
00:08:25,532 --> 00:08:30,694
<font color=#ffff00>I am shouting it you in English and
now I am doing it louder and slower.</font>

99
00:08:30,889 --> 00:08:32,520
<font color=#ffff00>Very silly, forgive me.</font>

100
00:08:33,752 --> 00:08:36,360
<font color=#ffff00>May I help?
Let me help.</font>

101
00:08:37,795 --> 00:08:39,847
<font color=#ffff00>I know your mustache.</font>

102
00:08:40,106 --> 00:08:44,122
<font color=#ffff00>From the papers.
You are the detective Hercules Poirot?</font>

103
00:08:44,669 --> 00:08:48,871
<font color=#ffff00>"Hercule Poirot. I do not slay
the lions, Mademoiselle."</font>

104
00:08:51,033 --> 00:08:54,068
<font color=#ffff00>Mary Debenham monsieur. I will
forget a name, but never a face.</font>

105
00:08:54,313 --> 00:08:56,126
<font color=#ffff00>Not yours, any way.</font>

106
00:08:56,424 --> 00:08:57,562
<font color=#ffff00>You come from Baghdad?</font>

107
00:08:59,112 --> 00:09:02,184
<font color=#ffff00>It's true.
No detail escapes his notice.</font>

108
00:09:02,472 --> 00:09:03,578
<font color=#ffff00>Your ticket.</font>

109
00:09:05,841 --> 00:09:08,001
<font color=#ffff00>I might also ask you if you
enjoyed your time there...</font>

110
00:09:08,136 --> 00:09:09,326
<font color=#ffff00>as a governess.</font>

111
00:09:10,064 --> 00:09:12,968
<font color=#ffff00>The chalk on your sleeve
and the Geography primar.</font>

112
00:09:13,176 --> 00:09:17,423
<font color=#ffff00>A governess or a cartographer.
I made my gamble.</font>

113
00:09:19,512 --> 00:09:20,992
<font color=#ffff00>I always begin them with Geography...</font>

114
00:09:21,096 --> 00:09:23,336
<font color=#ffff00>and monster them until they
have the world down cold.</font>

115
00:09:23,467 --> 00:09:25,416
<font color=#ffff00>They may get lost in life...</font>

116
00:09:25,704 --> 00:09:27,824
<font color=#ffff00>but I'll be damned if they
don't know where they are.</font>

117
00:09:29,757 --> 00:09:33,466
<font color=#ffff00>Well our chains are free.
Right on time.</font>

118
00:09:48,203 --> 00:09:50,600
<font color=#ffff00>I feel so free out here in the water.</font>

119
00:09:50,855 --> 00:09:52,691
<font color=#ffff00>I wish I could enjoy it.</font>

120
00:09:54,019 --> 00:09:56,509
<font color=#ffff00>- You should be out of this, Mary.
- Not now.</font>

121
00:09:57,576 --> 00:09:59,453
<font color=#ffff00>When it's all over.</font>

122
00:09:59,610 --> 00:10:01,067
<font color=#ffff00>When it's done.</font>

123
00:10:01,232 --> 00:10:03,384
<font color=#ffff00>Then nothing can touch us.</font>

124
00:10:24,225 --> 00:10:26,990
<font color=#ffff00><i>Istanbul</i></font>

125
00:10:33,269 --> 00:10:35,611
<font color=#ffff00><i>My holiday begins here.</i></font>

126
00:10:36,124 --> 00:10:40,448
<font color=#ffff00><i>I can see the soul of the
city in these humble breads.</i></font>

127
00:10:40,764 --> 00:10:44,150
<font color=#ffff00>The world insists on
destruction, yet here...</font>

128
00:10:44,265 --> 00:10:47,847
<font color=#ffff00>masterpieces are baked
to order every day.</font>

129
00:10:49,483 --> 00:10:51,187
<font color=#ffff00>Mohammed!</font>

130
00:10:53,669 --> 00:10:54,669
<font color=#ffff00>Mohammed, my friend...</font>

131
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:56,792
<font color=#ffff00>You are an artist.</font>

132
00:10:57,078 --> 00:10:58,668
<font color=#ffff00>My friend!</font>

133
00:10:58,887 --> 00:11:00,264
<font color=#ffff00>I am sorry.</font>

134
00:11:00,552 --> 00:11:02,038
<font color=#ffff00>Hey, come, come.</font>

135
00:11:02,358 --> 00:11:04,943
<font color=#ffff00>Don't mind us, we're just looking
for a place to have a private argument.</font>

136
00:11:04,967 --> 00:11:06,567
<font color=#ffff00>It will take some twenty minutes, or so.</font>

137
00:11:06,647 --> 00:11:09,137
<font color=#ffff00>I wish then we'll both come to an
agreement. Or at least I will, yes.</font>

138
00:11:09,161 --> 00:11:10,266
<font color=#ffff00>Monsieur Bouc!</font>

139
00:11:10,737 --> 00:11:12,794
<font color=#ffff00>Poirot! In the kitchen.</font>

140
00:11:13,061 --> 00:11:16,421
<font color=#ffff00>Well, of course, this man will sniff out the
perfect pastry faster than he catches...</font>

141
00:11:16,535 --> 00:11:17,535
<font color=#ffff00>a jewel thief.</font>

142
00:11:19,175 --> 00:11:23,591
<font color=#ffff00>No, I am no longer a police man, I can't
bail you out when they've got you badly.</font>

143
00:11:23,792 --> 00:11:25,722
<font color=#ffff00>This is my dear old friend,
the esteemed...</font>

144
00:11:25,992 --> 00:11:29,024
<font color=#ffff00>Poirot, whom I knew before the esteem.
Hercule Poirot, this is...</font>

145
00:11:29,025 --> 00:11:30,065
<font color=#ffff00>- A prostitute.
- She is.</font>

146
00:11:30,163 --> 00:11:32,523
<font color=#ffff00>I am. Bouc, you did not tell me
you had such famous friends.</font>

147
00:11:32,731 --> 00:11:34,652
<font color=#ffff00>We are friends because I
am the only person...</font>

148
00:11:34,823 --> 00:11:37,468
<font color=#ffff00>who never asks him any questions about
his cases, because I don't care.</font>

149
00:11:37,492 --> 00:11:39,263
<font color=#ffff00>And he never judges me for
being a terrible person.</font>

150
00:11:39,287 --> 00:11:40,287
<font color=#ffff00>Indeed you are.</font>

151
00:11:40,367 --> 00:11:42,850
<font color=#ffff00>Madame, Bouc, please join me
for a drink, yes?</font>

152
00:11:42,993 --> 00:11:44,274
<font color=#ffff00>You only have me for an hour.</font>

153
00:11:44,519 --> 00:11:47,927
<font color=#ffff00>I ride on the Orient Express at seven.
Official director business.</font>

154
00:11:48,198 --> 00:11:51,023
<font color=#ffff00>Uncle pays me absurdly to stay
on board his gorgeous train...</font>

155
00:11:51,237 --> 00:11:52,287
<font color=#ffff00>and far away from him...</font>

156
00:11:52,506 --> 00:11:53,506
<font color=#ffff00>at the home office...</font>

157
00:11:53,709 --> 00:11:56,313
<font color=#ffff00>Consigned to wine and
dine in handsome...</font>

158
00:11:56,562 --> 00:11:57,802
<font color=#ffff00>There is an art to nepotism.</font>

159
00:11:57,904 --> 00:11:59,650
<font color=#ffff00>And you are his Michelangelo!</font>

160
00:11:59,932 --> 00:12:00,932
<font color=#ffff00>Mr. Poirot.</font>

161
00:12:00,954 --> 00:12:02,047
<font color=#ffff00>Are you a prostitute as well?</font>

162
00:12:02,071 --> 00:12:04,319
<font color=#ffff00>- Certainly not.
- Is this man bothering you?</font>

163
00:12:04,679 --> 00:12:05,769
<font color=#ffff00>He is about to it.</font>

164
00:12:05,927 --> 00:12:07,847
<font color=#ffff00>- You are from the British consulate.
- I am sir.</font>

165
00:12:07,986 --> 00:12:09,026
<font color=#ffff00>It is the Kassner case.</font>

166
00:12:09,613 --> 00:12:10,829
<font color=#ffff00>Why, yes.</font>

167
00:12:11,017 --> 00:12:12,548
<font color=#ffff00>I was correct in certain predictions?</font>

168
00:12:13,164 --> 00:12:14,663
<font color=#ffff00>Quite.</font>

169
00:12:15,051 --> 00:12:16,343
<font color=#ffff00>I do not need to read the telegram.</font>

170
00:12:16,367 --> 00:12:17,367
<font color=#ffff00>How fun...</font>

171
00:12:17,543 --> 00:12:18,851
<font color=#ffff00>did someone cheat or die?</font>

172
00:12:19,093 --> 00:12:20,589
<font color=#ffff00>Unfortunately, both.</font>

173
00:12:23,079 --> 00:12:24,314
<font color=#ffff00>Someone has...</font>

174
00:12:24,570 --> 00:12:27,053
<font color=#ffff00>interrupted my longing for rest.</font>

175
00:12:27,239 --> 00:12:29,399
<font color=#ffff00>It appears that I must travel
with you tonight, Bouc.</font>

176
00:12:29,490 --> 00:12:31,450
<font color=#ffff00>Can you find me a cabin
on the Orient Express?</font>

177
00:12:31,644 --> 00:12:32,644
<font color=#ffff00>My friend...</font>

178
00:12:32,819 --> 00:12:35,859
<font color=#ffff00>I may not begin for much, but I sure as
hell can get you a bed on my train...</font>

179
00:12:36,071 --> 00:12:37,600
<font color=#ffff00>in the dead of winter. In three days...</font>

180
00:12:37,624 --> 00:12:41,266
<font color=#ffff00>free of care, concern, or crime.
You will love it.</font>

181
00:12:41,502 --> 00:12:43,899
<font color=#ffff00>Mademoiselle, it has been a pleasure.</font>

182
00:12:44,653 --> 00:12:47,768
<font color=#ffff00>Your luggage has been collected
and your expenses paid.</font>

183
00:12:48,094 --> 00:12:49,701
<font color=#ffff00>You will be next at Calais...</font>

184
00:12:49,939 --> 00:12:54,405
<font color=#ffff00>and then escorted to Dover, and
then by rail to London, Victoria.</font>

185
00:12:54,633 --> 00:12:57,049
<font color=#ffff00>- I would like to formally express...
- Please don't speak.</font>

186
00:12:57,324 --> 00:12:58,823
<font color=#ffff00>You make it worse.</font>

187
00:13:05,284 --> 00:13:07,505
<font color=#ffff00>- Here is the tip for you pal.
- Thank you, Mr. Marquez.</font>

188
00:13:07,914 --> 00:13:09,071
<font color=#ffff00>I didn't even carry your luggage.</font>

189
00:13:09,095 --> 00:13:10,174
<font color=#ffff00>I had a good week.</font>

190
00:13:10,371 --> 00:13:13,637
<font color=#ffff00>We celebrate when fortune smiles
, and we share the good fortune.</font>

191
00:13:13,894 --> 00:13:15,934
<font color=#ffff00>Remember to say nice things about us
Americans, huh?</font>

192
00:13:21,271 --> 00:13:22,292
<font color=#ffff00>No!</font>

193
00:13:22,553 --> 00:13:23,553
<font color=#ffff00>Hey, stop!</font>

194
00:13:29,580 --> 00:13:32,538
<font color=#ffff00>For you, Mr. Ratchett,
the best table in the.</font>

195
00:13:37,484 --> 00:13:39,102
<font color=#ffff00>Just here, sir.
The very best table.</font>

196
00:13:39,262 --> 00:13:40,827
<font color=#ffff00>I want that one.</font>

197
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:48,635
<font color=#ffff00>Hey, Masterman.
You got everything?</font>

198
00:13:48,969 --> 00:13:52,630
<font color=#ffff00>Kind of you to inquire, Mr. McQueen.
I do not make mistakes.</font>

199
00:13:55,366 --> 00:13:57,564
<font color=#ffff00>Oh my goodness! It's Count Andrenyi.</font>

200
00:13:57,751 --> 00:13:58,847
<font color=#ffff00>Come come come.</font>

201
00:13:59,063 --> 00:14:03,450
<font color=#ffff00>I saw you dance at Monte Cristo.
Could I take your photograph?</font>

202
00:14:12,502 --> 00:14:13,989
<font color=#ffff00>Please, not in my face, no!</font>

203
00:14:36,367 --> 00:14:37,693
<font color=#ffff00>Sorry.</font>

204
00:14:47,612 --> 00:14:50,027
<font color=#ffff00>The Orient Express!</font>

205
00:14:50,278 --> 00:14:53,658
<font color=#ffff00>With stops in Sofia, Nis,
Belgrade, Vinkovci and Brod...</font>

206
00:14:53,925 --> 00:14:57,573
<font color=#ffff00>with transfers to Bucharest, Zagreb,
Trieste, Venice, Milan, Lausanne...</font>

207
00:14:57,841 --> 00:14:59,902
<font color=#ffff00>Dijon, Paris, Bologna and Calais...</font>

208
00:15:00,166 --> 00:15:02,646
<font color=#ffff00>with connection to Dover and
London, leaves in fifteen minutes!</font>

209
00:15:02,821 --> 00:15:06,378
<font color=#ffff00>This way, Michel! Precious cargo
I need a first class compartment.</font>

210
00:15:06,694 --> 00:15:09,894
<font color=#ffff00>Give special care to my friend, Michel.
I want him pampered like a zoo panda.</font>

211
00:15:10,150 --> 00:15:12,195
<font color=#ffff00>But Monsieur Bouc, we are fully booked.
There is no place left.</font>

212
00:15:12,219 --> 00:15:13,996
<font color=#ffff00>Then we make space.
You can have the no. 11.</font>

213
00:15:14,167 --> 00:15:16,087
<font color=#ffff00>The eleven is always kept
open for official use.</font>

214
00:15:16,142 --> 00:15:17,209
<font color=#ffff00>It's very comfortable.</font>

215
00:15:17,465 --> 00:15:19,705
<font color=#ffff00>11 is taken. The Austrian
professor booked it 2 days ago.</font>

216
00:15:19,865 --> 00:15:22,185
<font color=#ffff00>There is not 1 first class
sleeper car in the whole train?</font>

217
00:15:22,252 --> 00:15:23,252
<font color=#ffff00>Negative, sir.</font>

218
00:15:23,371 --> 00:15:24,322
<font color=#ffff00>Second class?</font>

219
00:15:24,343 --> 00:15:25,453
<font color=#ffff00>There is no place left at all.</font>

220
00:15:25,477 --> 00:15:27,055
<font color=#ffff00>Mademoiselle Debenham.</font>

221
00:15:27,333 --> 00:15:28,935
<font color=#ffff00>Mr. Poirot, are you joining us?</font>

222
00:15:29,251 --> 00:15:31,006
<font color=#ffff00>It depends who wins this debate.</font>

223
00:15:31,363 --> 00:15:32,643
<font color=#ffff00>Have all the passengers arrived?</font>

224
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:35,182
<font color=#ffff00>All but one. Mr. Harris.</font>

225
00:15:35,398 --> 00:15:38,758
<font color=#ffff00>"All passengers must check in at least one
half hours prior it's time of departure...</font>

226
00:15:38,865 --> 00:15:40,344
<font color=#ffff00>"or their seat may be forfeit".</font>

227
00:15:40,558 --> 00:15:42,862
<font color=#ffff00>The half hour has passed.
The seat is forfeit.</font>

228
00:15:43,132 --> 00:15:46,946
<font color=#ffff00>Please take Monsieur Poirot's luggage to
number three, with Mr. McQueen.</font>

229
00:15:48,050 --> 00:15:49,081
<font color=#ffff00>Enjoy.</font>

230
00:15:49,317 --> 00:15:50,317
<font color=#ffff00>- Welcome Sir.
- Yes.</font>

231
00:15:53,445 --> 00:15:55,762
<font color=#ffff00>Number three is unlucky.</font>

232
00:15:59,302 --> 00:16:01,474
<font color=#ffff00>Apologies, madame.
I meant no disrespect to you.</font>

233
00:16:01,798 --> 00:16:03,468
<font color=#ffff00>Oh, you could try to mean a little..</font>

234
00:16:05,326 --> 00:16:09,155
<font color=#ffff00>One thing about train travel
you're always knocking into somebody.</font>

235
00:16:09,367 --> 00:16:10,367
<font color=#ffff00>It is wonderful.</font>

236
00:16:10,629 --> 00:16:12,775
<font color=#ffff00>Although I am looking
always to getting back.</font>

237
00:16:13,125 --> 00:16:15,813
<font color=#ffff00>Travel is my
spicy food, mosques, meeting men...</font>

238
00:16:16,024 --> 00:16:19,198
<font color=#ffff00>eventually just miss your own bed.</font>

239
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:26,764
<font color=#ffff00>I have been accused of
husband hunting abroad.</font>

240
00:16:28,048 --> 00:16:31,846
<font color=#ffff00>And I can't honestly deny it,.
I like my time alone, I do.</font>

241
00:16:31,985 --> 00:16:36,614
<font color=#ffff00>But a lady has certain needs that deserve
to be met, if she has any money...</font>

242
00:16:36,820 --> 00:16:39,020
<font color=#ffff00>and preferably, on a regular basis.</font>

243
00:16:42,101 --> 00:16:45,275
<font color=#ffff00>Oh my! Fire in the kitchen!</font>

244
00:16:45,501 --> 00:16:46,501
<font color=#ffff00><i>See you later, Madame!</i></font>

245
00:16:48,333 --> 00:16:49,333
<font color=#ffff00>Good evening.</font>

246
00:16:51,059 --> 00:16:52,113
<font color=#ffff00>Number nine.</font>

247
00:16:52,442 --> 00:16:53,442
<font color=#ffff00>Good evening.</font>

248
00:16:54,228 --> 00:16:55,741
<font color=#ffff00>How you doing?</font>

249
00:16:57,549 --> 00:16:59,012
<font color=#ffff00>No, after you.</font>

250
00:17:02,297 --> 00:17:03,518
<font color=#ffff00><i>Ah, number three.</i></font>

251
00:17:04,649 --> 00:17:06,501
<font color=#ffff00>Who is it? Ah, Mr. McQueen?</font>

252
00:17:06,589 --> 00:17:08,421
<font color=#ffff00>Yeah. I think you might
have the wrong birth.</font>

253
00:17:09,990 --> 00:17:12,099
<font color=#ffff00><i>Excuse me, is there a problem, sir?</i></font>

254
00:17:12,528 --> 00:17:13,636
<font color=#ffff00><i>No problem.</i></font>

255
00:17:13,937 --> 00:17:15,097
<font color=#ffff00>The train is full.</font>

256
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:19,780
<font color=#ffff00>And I think that we are,
how do you say? "Bunkies".</font>

257
00:17:21,477 --> 00:17:22,477
<font color=#ffff00>Really?</font>

258
00:17:22,725 --> 00:17:25,245
<font color=#ffff00>I am equally disappointed in you.
This is nice.</font>

259
00:17:33,914 --> 00:17:35,340
<font color=#ffff00>Come along, darlings.</font>

260
00:18:01,142 --> 00:18:02,157
<font color=#ffff00>No.</font>

261
00:18:05,963 --> 00:18:06,979
<font color=#ffff00>No.</font>

262
00:18:08,633 --> 00:18:09,633
<font color=#ffff00>This?</font>

263
00:18:13,072 --> 00:18:15,261
<font color=#ffff00>Why my... unpacked?</font>

264
00:18:17,252 --> 00:18:20,783
<font color=#ffff00><i>Final call for passengers!</i></font>

265
00:18:29,423 --> 00:18:31,045
<font color=#ffff00>Shall we brush it?</font>

266
00:18:31,292 --> 00:18:33,932
<font color=#ffff00>What the hell is taking them so long?</font>

267
00:18:34,108 --> 00:18:35,832
<font color=#ffff00>Soon as we're getting out of
here, have them make up the bed.</font>

268
00:18:35,856 --> 00:18:37,125
<font color=#ffff00>It's already fixed, Mr. Ratchett.</font>

269
00:18:37,149 --> 00:18:40,642
<font color=#ffff00>No, I want the bed made.
And bring my Dictaphone.</font>

270
00:18:40,921 --> 00:18:42,729
<font color=#ffff00>Dogs on the table. It's
the most disgust-able</font>

271
00:18:42,929 --> 00:18:44,285
<font color=#ffff00>thing I've ever seen in a while.</font>

272
00:18:44,498 --> 00:18:46,138
<font color=#ffff00>- Yes sir.
- I want you to get McQueen...</font>

273
00:18:46,173 --> 00:18:48,479
<font color=#ffff00>And have him bring every
receipt from the Milan sale.</font>

274
00:18:48,759 --> 00:18:50,156
<font color=#ffff00>- I want you to get it done.
- Yes sir.</font>

275
00:18:50,180 --> 00:18:51,524
<font color=#ffff00>I want you to get it done now.</font>

276
00:18:56,238 --> 00:18:58,532
<font color=#ffff00>- Did I say get it done now?
- Right away sir.</font>

277
00:19:57,119 --> 00:19:58,778
<font color=#ffff00><i>Better watch yourself.</i></font>

278
00:20:00,543 --> 00:20:02,263
<font color=#ffff00>Your coffee, Mr. Ratchett.</font>

279
00:20:05,751 --> 00:20:06,884
<font color=#ffff00>Who did this?</font>

280
00:20:07,034 --> 00:20:08,758
<font color=#ffff00>I can't say, sir.</font>

281
00:20:20,271 --> 00:20:21,596
<font color=#ffff00>Good evening, Mrs. Hubbard.</font>

282
00:20:21,769 --> 00:20:23,132
<font color=#ffff00>Hello, Mr. Masterman.</font>

283
00:20:39,672 --> 00:20:40,722
<font color=#ffff00>Well, hello.</font>

284
00:20:42,836 --> 00:20:45,409
<font color=#ffff00>Eyes linger any longer, I'll
have to charge rent.</font>

285
00:20:46,135 --> 00:20:47,575
<font color=#ffff00>I'll pay.</font>

286
00:20:48,860 --> 00:20:50,347
<font color=#ffff00>Have another drink.</font>

287
00:20:52,171 --> 00:20:54,057
<font color=#ffff00>Are you insulted?</font>

288
00:20:54,211 --> 00:20:55,733
<font color=#ffff00>Disappointed.</font>

289
00:20:56,515 --> 00:20:59,093
<font color=#ffff00>Some men have a good look.</font>

290
00:20:59,381 --> 00:21:00,962
<font color=#ffff00>All they have to do is...</font>

291
00:21:01,233 --> 00:21:04,220
<font color=#ffff00>keep their mouth shut, and
they can take on any prize they want.</font>

292
00:21:06,527 --> 00:21:09,405
<font color=#ffff00>Still, the mouth opens.</font>

293
00:21:24,992 --> 00:21:26,432
<font color=#ffff00>Is everything alright, Mrs. Hubbard?</font>

294
00:21:26,659 --> 00:21:29,475
<font color=#ffff00>You have a strong intuition, I know.</font>

295
00:21:31,593 --> 00:21:33,731
<font color=#ffff00>My second husband used to say just so.</font>

296
00:21:34,566 --> 00:21:37,271
<font color=#ffff00>Hold that, he was my first.</font>

297
00:21:37,665 --> 00:21:38,572
<font color=#ffff00>Yeah.</font>

298
00:21:38,607 --> 00:21:40,268
<font color=#ffff00>Brightest man I've ever met.</font>

299
00:21:40,495 --> 00:21:43,434
<font color=#ffff00>Face like a turnip, but
I loved that turnip.</font>

300
00:21:44,971 --> 00:21:46,143
<font color=#ffff00>It was nice to talk.</font>

301
00:21:47,742 --> 00:21:48,742
<font color=#ffff00><i>Excuse me.</i></font>

302
00:21:53,083 --> 00:21:54,623
<font color=#ffff00>Goodnight.</font>

303
00:22:11,385 --> 00:22:13,997
<font color=#ffff00><i>Mr. Poirot breakfast.</i></font>

304
00:22:18,259 --> 00:22:19,259
<font color=#ffff00>When you take supper...</font>

305
00:22:19,422 --> 00:22:21,139
<font color=#ffff00>I'll move Mr. McQueen to
Monsieur Bouc's compartment.</font>

306
00:22:21,163 --> 00:22:23,163
<font color=#ffff00>You will travel first class, monsieur.</font>

307
00:22:28,297 --> 00:22:29,911
<font color=#ffff00><i>- Bon apetite.
- And the eggs?</i></font>

308
00:22:51,811 --> 00:22:53,051
<font color=#ffff00>Good afternoon.</font>

309
00:22:53,211 --> 00:22:54,359
<font color=#ffff00>Ah, Mrs. Hubbard.</font>

310
00:22:54,614 --> 00:22:55,835
<font color=#ffff00>Good afternoon.</font>

311
00:22:57,432 --> 00:22:58,466
<font color=#ffff00>There we are.</font>

312
00:22:58,761 --> 00:23:01,980
<font color=#ffff00>- Complements of the Orient Express.
- Thank you, Mr. Bouc.</font>

313
00:23:02,274 --> 00:23:05,232
<font color=#ffff00>I am here for all of your needs.</font>

314
00:23:05,465 --> 00:23:06,670
<font color=#ffff00>No thank you. I do not drink.</font>

315
00:23:06,907 --> 00:23:09,033
<font color=#ffff00>I do not agree with you.</font>

316
00:23:09,283 --> 00:23:11,757
<font color=#ffff00>Sin doesn't agree with me.</font>

317
00:23:12,086 --> 00:23:15,021
<font color=#ffff00>Vice is where the devil
finds his darlings.</font>

318
00:23:15,314 --> 00:23:16,405
<font color=#ffff00>We should no longer speak.</font>

319
00:23:19,074 --> 00:23:20,605
<font color=#ffff00>Good afternoon.</font>

320
00:23:20,822 --> 00:23:25,076
<font color=#ffff00>Monsieur, how about an appetizer?</font>

321
00:23:25,361 --> 00:23:28,889
<font color=#ffff00>I regret I have an appointment
with the director of the train.</font>

322
00:23:29,154 --> 00:23:31,430
<font color=#ffff00>He was gonna leave anyway.</font>

323
00:23:31,656 --> 00:23:32,656
<font color=#ffff00>Please sir.</font>

324
00:23:37,603 --> 00:23:39,042
<font color=#ffff00>All settled in?</font>

325
00:23:41,020 --> 00:23:42,859
<font color=#ffff00>As advertised.</font>

326
00:23:43,076 --> 00:23:46,699
<font color=#ffff00>And yet, the best things
on the train are not food.</font>

327
00:23:50,009 --> 00:23:51,210
<font color=#ffff00>You know? There is something about a...</font>

328
00:23:51,234 --> 00:23:54,196
<font color=#ffff00>a tangle of strangers pressed together
for days, with nothing in common...</font>

329
00:23:54,455 --> 00:23:56,375
<font color=#ffff00>but they need to go from
one place to another...</font>

330
00:23:56,533 --> 00:23:58,484
<font color=#ffff00>and never see each other again.</font>

331
00:23:58,699 --> 00:24:00,640
<font color=#ffff00>Boredom, plus anonymity, plus...</font>

332
00:24:00,898 --> 00:24:02,768
<font color=#ffff00>constant gentle rocking.</font>

333
00:24:03,810 --> 00:24:06,292
<font color=#ffff00>With your hobbies, you'll
never amount to anything.</font>

334
00:24:06,523 --> 00:24:07,843
<font color=#ffff00>God I hope so.</font>

335
00:24:09,014 --> 00:24:10,320
<font color=#ffff00>Oh give me the fish.</font>

336
00:24:12,854 --> 00:24:17,650
<font color=#ffff00>Exchange grouper for soul,
Es Carole for the potato, and...</font>

337
00:24:18,615 --> 00:24:19,975
<font color=#ffff00>the beef sauce for the velout√(Copyright).</font>

338
00:24:22,968 --> 00:24:24,728
<font color=#ffff00>Garcon, that sounds superb.
The same for me.</font>

339
00:24:26,999 --> 00:24:28,482
<font color=#ffff00>The princess Dragomiroff.</font>

340
00:24:29,288 --> 00:24:32,488
<font color=#ffff00>You know, if I had the word to marry for
money I would marry for that much money.</font>

341
00:24:33,642 --> 00:24:34,802
<font color=#ffff00>I brushed Dalia this morning.</font>

342
00:24:35,048 --> 00:24:37,373
<font color=#ffff00>No, you tortured my darling doggy.</font>

343
00:24:37,655 --> 00:24:38,764
<font color=#ffff00><i>I asked you to brush her.</i></font>

344
00:24:38,996 --> 00:24:40,938
<font color=#ffff00>You still enjoying your Dickens?</font>

345
00:24:41,272 --> 00:24:42,830
<font color=#ffff00>Very much, Mon'Amie.</font>

346
00:24:43,214 --> 00:24:46,645
<font color=#ffff00>You know, with your books and your capers,
you're missing out on romance.</font>

347
00:24:47,831 --> 00:24:50,029
<font color=#ffff00>The romance never goes unpunished.</font>

348
00:24:50,730 --> 00:24:52,045
<font color=#ffff00>There was...</font>

349
00:24:55,092 --> 00:24:57,669
<font color=#ffff00>There was someone once.</font>

350
00:25:08,759 --> 00:25:12,344
<font color=#ffff00>I would prefer into future I
to be sit not with that man.</font>

351
00:25:12,599 --> 00:25:16,640
<font color=#ffff00>Like should be seated with like.
We are not alike.</font>

352
00:25:17,925 --> 00:25:21,578
<font color=#ffff00>Not all of us are so concerned with
the separation of races, professor.</font>

353
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:26,361
<font color=#ffff00>It is out of respect for all kinds
that I prefer to keep them separated.</font>

354
00:25:26,586 --> 00:25:31,414
<font color=#ffff00>To mix your red wine and the
white, would be to ruin them both.</font>

355
00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:40,207
<font color=#ffff00>I like a good rose.</font>

356
00:26:22,073 --> 00:26:23,821
<font color=#ffff00>Hey, how you doing?
Would you mind...</font>

357
00:26:24,145 --> 00:26:25,357
<font color=#ffff00>if I join you?</font>

358
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:28,649
<font color=#ffff00>Dessert is an indulgence...</font>

359
00:26:28,946 --> 00:26:32,626
<font color=#ffff00>and I feel kind of silly
stupid, indulging alone.</font>

360
00:26:32,940 --> 00:26:35,168
<font color=#ffff00>I am at my happiest alone.</font>

361
00:26:35,954 --> 00:26:36,989
<font color=#ffff00>But...</font>

362
00:26:37,314 --> 00:26:40,943
<font color=#ffff00>For a piece of your
fragility, pleased to join you.</font>

363
00:26:41,174 --> 00:26:44,333
<font color=#ffff00>Oh my. Excuse me, another fork.</font>

364
00:26:47,048 --> 00:26:49,046
<font color=#ffff00>I have been trying to
make your acquit Mr. Poirot.</font>

365
00:26:50,649 --> 00:26:54,156
<font color=#ffff00>I never ever sat so
close to fame before me.</font>

366
00:26:54,436 --> 00:26:56,345
<font color=#ffff00>Now I tell a lie.</font>

367
00:26:56,561 --> 00:26:59,201
<font color=#ffff00>Once I was in a bus with Ty Cobb.</font>

368
00:27:00,665 --> 00:27:02,262
<font color=#ffff00>Ball player, Detroit.</font>

369
00:27:05,390 --> 00:27:08,121
<font color=#ffff00>Would you mind if I have the little
curly bit at the top?</font>

370
00:27:08,412 --> 00:27:10,471
<font color=#ffff00>You are not a bird though?</font>

371
00:27:11,542 --> 00:27:13,529
<font color=#ffff00>A strange peculiar man.</font>

372
00:27:13,810 --> 00:27:16,726
<font color=#ffff00>I am of a age where I know what I like
and what I do not like.</font>

373
00:27:16,975 --> 00:27:22,048
<font color=#ffff00>What I like, I enjoy enormously.
What I dislike, I can not abide.</font>

374
00:27:22,361 --> 00:27:24,803
<font color=#ffff00>For an instance,
the temporary pleasantries before</font>

375
00:27:25,003 --> 00:27:27,395
<font color=#ffff00>what is determined to be
a business discussion.</font>

376
00:27:28,097 --> 00:27:29,379
<font color=#ffff00>You're fun.</font>

377
00:27:30,730 --> 00:27:31,730
<font color=#ffff00>All right.</font>

378
00:27:32,825 --> 00:27:34,891
<font color=#ffff00>I would like to offer you a job.</font>

379
00:27:36,789 --> 00:27:39,785
<font color=#ffff00>"The avenger of the innocents".
That's what they call you in the papers.</font>

380
00:27:40,054 --> 00:27:41,302
<font color=#ffff00>You are an innocent?</font>

381
00:27:41,523 --> 00:27:42,939
<font color=#ffff00>I am a businessman.</font>

382
00:27:43,222 --> 00:27:47,733
<font color=#ffff00>I am an art dealer.
I mean, I am new to it.</font>

383
00:27:48,007 --> 00:27:50,684
<font color=#ffff00>But my beginner's luck
has worked out.</font>

384
00:27:51,597 --> 00:27:52,902
<font color=#ffff00>Relics, antiquities.</font>

385
00:27:53,265 --> 00:27:56,270
<font color=#ffff00>Rugs, rare. Orientals.</font>

386
00:27:57,281 --> 00:28:01,362
<font color=#ffff00>I'm new to the game, so, you
know, I got the amateur eye ball.</font>

387
00:28:01,656 --> 00:28:05,186
<font color=#ffff00>But I got a little problem with the...</font>

388
00:28:05,439 --> 00:28:07,427
<font color=#ffff00>so called praises.</font>

389
00:28:07,624 --> 00:28:09,473
<font color=#ffff00>You can't trust a one.</font>

390
00:28:11,671 --> 00:28:13,328
<font color=#ffff00>Some of my customers...</font>

391
00:28:14,465 --> 00:28:15,665
<font color=#ffff00>They buy a piece...</font>

392
00:28:15,737 --> 00:28:19,649
<font color=#ffff00>They find out they are
not exactly original...</font>

393
00:28:19,879 --> 00:28:21,121
<font color=#ffff00>which is not really my fault...</font>

394
00:28:21,343 --> 00:28:24,756
<font color=#ffff00>if a Kashan silk scarf is a fake.</font>

395
00:28:25,025 --> 00:28:26,025
<font color=#ffff00>Right?</font>

396
00:28:29,636 --> 00:28:31,964
<font color=#ffff00>But I've managed to make
a few enemies, it's the thing.</font>

397
00:28:32,245 --> 00:28:35,274
<font color=#ffff00>Got a few letters,
people making threats.</font>

398
00:28:36,266 --> 00:28:38,614
<font color=#ffff00>And most likely it's the Italians.</font>

399
00:28:39,340 --> 00:28:43,162
<font color=#ffff00>I sold them a set of
Oriental carpets in Milan.</font>

400
00:28:44,417 --> 00:28:47,926
<font color=#ffff00>And the buyers weren't so happy
with the providence.</font>

401
00:28:49,241 --> 00:28:51,994
<font color=#ffff00>And they want their money
back with interest, you know?</font>

402
00:28:52,241 --> 00:28:53,241
<font color=#ffff00>Italians.</font>

403
00:28:53,826 --> 00:28:55,048
<font color=#ffff00>A guinea is guinea.</font>

404
00:28:56,128 --> 00:28:59,415
<font color=#ffff00>And then comes along
the genius detective.</font>

405
00:28:59,667 --> 00:29:00,832
<font color=#ffff00>Me?</font>

406
00:29:01,024 --> 00:29:04,196
<font color=#ffff00>- Yes you. Hercules Poirot.
- Hercule.</font>

407
00:29:07,672 --> 00:29:08,872
<font color=#ffff00>Here is what I'd like to do.</font>

408
00:29:09,089 --> 00:29:11,872
<font color=#ffff00>I would like to hire you
to watch my back...</font>

409
00:29:12,214 --> 00:29:14,100
<font color=#ffff00>until I get someplace safe.</font>

410
00:29:15,362 --> 00:29:17,444
<font color=#ffff00>It's easy money for you.</font>

411
00:29:17,685 --> 00:29:19,394
<font color=#ffff00>And it's peace of mind
for me, you know?</font>

412
00:29:19,668 --> 00:29:21,138
<font color=#ffff00>- I understand.
- Good.</font>

413
00:29:21,391 --> 00:29:22,323
<font color=#ffff00>I refuse.</font>

414
00:29:22,389 --> 00:29:24,203
<font color=#ffff00>That's bad.</font>

415
00:29:25,504 --> 00:29:28,466
<font color=#ffff00>I didn't make
myself clear enough.</font>

416
00:29:28,809 --> 00:29:32,585
<font color=#ffff00>You see, someone is out to get me.</font>

417
00:29:32,786 --> 00:29:36,377
<font color=#ffff00>And I know I'm not the best...
Not by a long shot.</font>

418
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:40,485
<font color=#ffff00>And if there is a world after this, where I
will face judgment, just like you.</font>

419
00:29:40,748 --> 00:29:41,748
<font color=#ffff00>But...</font>

420
00:29:44,009 --> 00:29:47,080
<font color=#ffff00>I ain't in no goddamn rush to do it.</font>

421
00:29:47,662 --> 00:29:49,356
<font color=#ffff00>- You are holding a gun at me?
- No.</font>

422
00:29:49,696 --> 00:29:52,024
<font color=#ffff00>Not you. On the world.</font>

423
00:29:52,327 --> 00:29:54,424
<font color=#ffff00>I exist in the world.
Do not point the gun at me.</font>

424
00:29:54,795 --> 00:29:56,355
<font color=#ffff00>How does ten thousand sound for a week?</font>

425
00:29:56,550 --> 00:29:58,550
<font color=#ffff00>It's a generous offer Mr Rachette.
I must decline.</font>

426
00:29:58,648 --> 00:30:00,728
<font color=#ffff00>- Fifteen thousand?
- You didn't hear me, I declined.</font>

427
00:30:00,919 --> 00:30:02,184
<font color=#ffff00>Oh, I get it.</font>

428
00:30:03,171 --> 00:30:07,715
<font color=#ffff00>It's not flashing out for the
great Hercules Poirot. Huh?</font>

429
00:30:07,936 --> 00:30:08,936
<font color=#ffff00>Not new flash-books...</font>

430
00:30:09,084 --> 00:30:11,604
<font color=#ffff00>You sell fakes to gangsters.
You're suffering the consequences.</font>

431
00:30:11,867 --> 00:30:13,827
<font color=#ffff00>I detect criminals.
I do not protect them.</font>

432
00:30:15,384 --> 00:30:17,320
<font color=#ffff00>So you are saying no
to my dirty money.</font>

433
00:30:17,575 --> 00:30:19,264
<font color=#ffff00>I say no to you, Mr. Ratchett.</font>

434
00:30:20,394 --> 00:30:22,408
<font color=#ffff00>Business with the gun, right?
Is that what it was?</font>

435
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:24,689
<font color=#ffff00>This is far more personal than that.</font>

436
00:30:26,502 --> 00:30:28,288
<font color=#ffff00>I do not like your face.</font>

437
00:30:30,803 --> 00:30:32,497
<font color=#ffff00>If you'll excuse me...</font>

438
00:30:33,744 --> 00:30:35,584
<font color=#ffff00>You liked my cake, didn't ya?</font>

439
00:30:35,761 --> 00:30:39,423
<font color=#ffff00>The cake was excellent.
Have a pleasant afternoon, Mr. Ratchett.</font>

440
00:31:02,948 --> 00:31:04,244
<font color=#ffff00>Thank you.</font>

441
00:31:06,143 --> 00:31:07,236
<font color=#ffff00><i>How cold.</i></font>

442
00:31:27,121 --> 00:31:29,343
<font color=#ffff00>Mossier Katherine.</font>

443
00:31:31,026 --> 00:31:32,803
<font color=#ffff00>Mon'Amie.</font>

444
00:31:43,122 --> 00:31:44,633
<font color=#ffff00>Mr. Dickens.</font>

445
00:31:58,676 --> 00:31:59,887
<font color=#ffff00>Mr. Ratchett?</font>

446
00:32:07,743 --> 00:32:08,743
<font color=#ffff00>Mr. Ratchett?</font>

447
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:13,862
<font color=#ffff00>Yeah, mossier.
Goodnight.</font>

448
00:32:34,575 --> 00:32:35,575
<font color=#ffff00>Mrs. Hubbard?</font>

449
00:32:35,607 --> 00:32:37,260
<font color=#ffff00>It's always Mrs. Hubbard.</font>

450
00:32:37,584 --> 00:32:38,935
<font color=#ffff00>Mrs. Hubbard.</font>

451
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:33,063
<font color=#ffff00>Did we die?</font>

452
00:33:33,332 --> 00:33:35,889
<font color=#ffff00><i>Ladies and gentlemen,
the train has been derailed.</i></font>

453
00:33:36,562 --> 00:33:37,906
<font color=#ffff00><i>You alright, Mr. Marquez?</i></font>

454
00:33:38,174 --> 00:33:40,805
<font color=#ffff00><i>I'm fine. Thank you.</i></font>

455
00:33:41,119 --> 00:33:42,319
<font color=#ffff00><i>Mr. Bouc will speak to you...</i></font>

456
00:33:44,977 --> 00:33:46,093
<font color=#ffff00><i>All clear.</i></font>

457
00:33:46,270 --> 00:33:48,093
<font color=#ffff00><i>Are we going to die?</i></font>

458
00:33:56,198 --> 00:33:57,914
<font color=#ffff00><i>My Katherine.</i></font>

459
00:34:00,202 --> 00:34:02,040
<font color=#ffff00>My beautiful...</font>

460
00:34:43,070 --> 00:34:47,892
<font color=#ffff00>Ladies and gentlemen, I'm afraid that
our train is still unable to go anywhere.</font>

461
00:34:48,076 --> 00:34:49,079
<font color=#ffff00>Yeah, except down.</font>

462
00:34:49,335 --> 00:34:50,935
<font color=#ffff00>How long are we supposed to just figure?</font>

463
00:34:50,981 --> 00:34:53,150
<font color=#ffff00>Yes, someone must be doing something.</font>

464
00:34:53,458 --> 00:34:56,150
<font color=#ffff00>Of course I'm doing something.
I am doing nothing.</font>

465
00:34:56,390 --> 00:34:58,573
<font color=#ffff00><i>Precisely two hours and ten minutes ago,</i></font>

466
00:34:58,673 --> 00:35:00,638
<font color=#ffff00><i>when we didn't arrive in
Broad as scheduled...</i></font>

467
00:35:00,878 --> 00:35:02,978
<font color=#ffff00><i>The station master will have
surmised our situation...</i></font>

468
00:35:03,002 --> 00:35:05,534
<font color=#ffff00><i>and already sent a team
to excavate the engine...</i></font>

469
00:35:05,745 --> 00:35:07,838
<font color=#ffff00><i>clear our path and send us on our way.</i></font>

470
00:35:08,054 --> 00:35:09,311
<font color=#ffff00><i>Until then, I assure you...</i></font>

471
00:35:09,335 --> 00:35:12,530
<font color=#ffff00>we will all be made warm,
and, fed and comfortable.</font>

472
00:35:13,286 --> 00:35:14,367
<font color=#ffff00>We could walk.</font>

473
00:35:14,535 --> 00:35:16,954
<font color=#ffff00>We could die of exposure trying.</font>

474
00:35:17,246 --> 00:35:18,969
<font color=#ffff00>I have a connection to make.</font>

475
00:35:19,166 --> 00:35:21,893
<font color=#ffff00>My boat sails the day after
tomorrow, from France.</font>

476
00:35:22,377 --> 00:35:25,487
<font color=#ffff00>Without you, I would wedger.
Or me in London.</font>

477
00:35:25,733 --> 00:35:29,010
<font color=#ffff00>I hold you accountable for
my loss of time, Mr. Bouc.</font>

478
00:35:29,046 --> 00:35:30,960
<font color=#ffff00>Madame, you can't hold me
accountable for the weather.</font>

479
00:35:30,984 --> 00:35:32,860
<font color=#ffff00>Of course, I can.
You are the one here.</font>

480
00:35:32,939 --> 00:35:35,104
<font color=#ffff00>And my conference in Turin?</font>

481
00:35:35,137 --> 00:35:37,402
<font color=#ffff00>And I was to meet a
factory in Sochaux.</font>

482
00:35:37,981 --> 00:35:40,146
<font color=#ffff00>Yes, some things...
They are in God's hands.</font>

483
00:35:40,814 --> 00:35:42,691
<font color=#ffff00>It is not for us to say..</font>

484
00:35:42,867 --> 00:35:46,085
<font color=#ffff00>If we deserve to arrive
safely to our destination...</font>

485
00:35:47,484 --> 00:35:50,840
<font color=#ffff00>or if, like Lucifer,
we must fall.</font>

486
00:36:01,508 --> 00:36:03,806
<font color=#ffff00>Breakfast for you, Mr. Ratchett!</font>

487
00:36:05,289 --> 00:36:06,954
<font color=#ffff00>Ah. Bonjour, Mr. Masterman.</font>

488
00:36:08,688 --> 00:36:09,877
<font color=#ffff00>There is problem?</font>

489
00:36:10,151 --> 00:36:11,403
<font color=#ffff00>I can't say, sir.</font>

490
00:36:11,717 --> 00:36:13,070
<font color=#ffff00>Mr. Ratchett?</font>

491
00:36:26,705 --> 00:36:28,045
<font color=#ffff00>That is cold air.</font>

492
00:36:28,286 --> 00:36:32,009
<font color=#ffff00>Please bring Mr. Bouc immediately,
and also Dr. Arbuthnot.</font>

493
00:36:51,926 --> 00:36:53,439
<font color=#ffff00>Good god.</font>

494
00:36:53,778 --> 00:36:55,934
<font color=#ffff00>Touch nothing else,
only the body.</font>

495
00:36:59,372 --> 00:37:01,273
<font color=#ffff00>By God, this is horrible.</font>

496
00:37:01,501 --> 00:37:03,805
<font color=#ffff00>First the snow and now...</font>

497
00:37:04,059 --> 00:37:06,988
<font color=#ffff00>I'll have to meet with the police and
make some statement in some grimy station.</font>

498
00:37:07,012 --> 00:37:08,949
<font color=#ffff00>And a man has died.</font>

499
00:37:09,876 --> 00:37:11,248
<font color=#ffff00>And a man has died.</font>

500
00:37:11,405 --> 00:37:13,375
<font color=#ffff00>He was stabbed.</font>

501
00:37:13,629 --> 00:37:14,629
<font color=#ffff00>Long straight edge knife.</font>

502
00:37:14,864 --> 00:37:17,918
<font color=#ffff00>Multiple stab wounds, some shallow
some cut clean through muscle.</font>

503
00:37:18,089 --> 00:37:19,449
<font color=#ffff00>Left hand side or right hand side?</font>

504
00:37:19,633 --> 00:37:21,119
<font color=#ffff00>That's the thing.</font>

505
00:37:21,412 --> 00:37:25,429
<font color=#ffff00>It appears that the killer maybe
closed his eyes and struck blind.</font>

506
00:37:25,650 --> 00:37:28,868
<font color=#ffff00>Could you estimate the time of death?</font>

507
00:37:29,081 --> 00:37:31,320
<font color=#ffff00>It's hard to say
with the window opened...</font>

508
00:37:31,488 --> 00:37:34,261
<font color=#ffff00>but my best guess is
between midnight and 2:00.</font>

509
00:37:34,408 --> 00:37:36,883
<font color=#ffff00>But no one went to his compartment.
And I sat on my seat all night.</font>

510
00:37:36,907 --> 00:37:39,757
<font color=#ffff00>I would have seen if someone came,
It's impossible.</font>

511
00:37:41,437 --> 00:37:43,326
<font color=#ffff00>Thank you Doctor.
Please return to the dining car.</font>

512
00:37:43,350 --> 00:37:45,180
<font color=#ffff00>Michel, secure this carriage.</font>

513
00:37:47,428 --> 00:37:48,657
<font color=#ffff00>Poirot.</font>

514
00:37:51,891 --> 00:37:53,678
<font color=#ffff00>I need your help, my friend.</font>

515
00:37:57,064 --> 00:37:58,312
<font color=#ffff00>You have to find who did this.</font>

516
00:37:58,593 --> 00:38:01,261
<font color=#ffff00>Please, I employ you on behalf
of the Orient Express.</font>

517
00:38:01,405 --> 00:38:03,512
<font color=#ffff00>When the police arrives we can
present them with a case closed.</font>

518
00:38:03,536 --> 00:38:05,397
<font color=#ffff00>You are the only one who can save me.</font>

519
00:38:05,674 --> 00:38:09,349
<font color=#ffff00>Your faith touches me, Mon Cher.
But I must held this rest.</font>

520
00:38:09,661 --> 00:38:12,521
<font color=#ffff00>Well, think of it as a little
beach time puzzle.</font>

521
00:38:12,733 --> 00:38:14,422
<font color=#ffff00>That's nothing to your mind!</font>

522
00:38:14,677 --> 00:38:16,626
<font color=#ffff00>You look up the antecedents
of the passengers.</font>

523
00:38:16,885 --> 00:38:19,952
<font color=#ffff00>You will establish the Boniface
And then do what you do.</font>

524
00:38:20,221 --> 00:38:24,437
<font color=#ffff00>You sit in a chair
and you eat your cake...</font>

525
00:38:24,633 --> 00:38:26,633
<font color=#ffff00>and you think, until the
solution present itself.</font>

526
00:38:26,864 --> 00:38:28,693
<font color=#ffff00>What else are you going to do
while we sit here in the snow?</font>

527
00:38:28,717 --> 00:38:31,352
<font color=#ffff00>Without constant stimulation,
your little Grey cells will starve and die.</font>

528
00:38:31,376 --> 00:38:32,713
<font color=#ffff00>Do you think that is what I do?
I sit in the chair...</font>

529
00:38:32,737 --> 00:38:35,029
<font color=#ffff00>I have a little piece of cake
and then I come up with a..</font>

530
00:38:35,053 --> 00:38:36,459
<font color=#ffff00>- I don't know what are you do.
- I have my Dickens.</font>

531
00:38:36,483 --> 00:38:37,874
<font color=#ffff00>Damn your Dickens!</font>

532
00:38:38,845 --> 00:38:41,245
<font color=#ffff00>If we leave this to the police,
they will choose a culprit...</font>

533
00:38:41,283 --> 00:38:43,255
<font color=#ffff00>Right or wrong, and
then they'll hang him.</font>

534
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:44,600
<font color=#ffff00>Most probably Mr. Marquez...</font>

535
00:38:44,756 --> 00:38:46,735
<font color=#ffff00>for no other reason, than
his name is Marquez.</font>

536
00:38:46,981 --> 00:38:49,366
<font color=#ffff00>Or Dr. Arbuthnot, for
the color of his skin.</font>

537
00:38:54,791 --> 00:38:57,610
<font color=#ffff00>You are the only one
who can bring justice.</font>

538
00:39:00,805 --> 00:39:02,725
<font color=#ffff00>- Let me have a map of this coach.
- Of course.</font>

539
00:39:02,787 --> 00:39:03,877
<font color=#ffff00>- Every passport.
- Anything.</font>

540
00:39:03,901 --> 00:39:05,781
<font color=#ffff00>Interviews arranged with
all of the passengers.</font>

541
00:39:05,821 --> 00:39:08,768
<font color=#ffff00>Evidence, order and method,
until one culprit emerges.</font>

542
00:39:08,914 --> 00:39:10,619
<font color=#ffff00>I do not approve of
murder, my friend.</font>

543
00:39:10,826 --> 00:39:12,919
<font color=#ffff00>Every day we meet people the world
could have better without yet...</font>

544
00:39:12,943 --> 00:39:14,109
<font color=#ffff00>we do not kill them.</font>

545
00:39:14,357 --> 00:39:16,717
<font color=#ffff00>We must be better than the beasts.</font>

546
00:39:18,589 --> 00:39:20,835
<font color=#ffff00>So let us find this killer.</font>

547
00:39:24,977 --> 00:39:27,590
<font color=#ffff00>Ladies and gentlemen,
allow me to...</font>

548
00:39:27,849 --> 00:39:30,328
<font color=#ffff00>It appears that, our
bad luck has worsened.</font>

549
00:39:30,541 --> 00:39:31,541
<font color=#ffff00>That is...</font>

550
00:39:31,676 --> 00:39:34,452
<font color=#ffff00>A passenger has
died on the train.</font>

551
00:39:34,716 --> 00:39:36,081
<font color=#ffff00>Monsieur Ratchett.</font>

552
00:39:45,153 --> 00:39:46,594
<font color=#ffff00>Looks like they got him after all.</font>

553
00:39:46,836 --> 00:39:48,608
<font color=#ffff00>Do you assume he was killed?</font>

554
00:39:48,867 --> 00:39:50,376
<font color=#ffff00>No, no.</font>

555
00:39:50,514 --> 00:39:53,038
<font color=#ffff00>I just meant he was in
perfectly good health.</font>

556
00:39:53,245 --> 00:39:54,589
<font color=#ffff00>He had his enemies, that's all.</font>

557
00:39:54,877 --> 00:39:56,671
<font color=#ffff00>Indeed he did, he was murdered.</font>

558
00:39:58,305 --> 00:40:01,020
<font color=#ffff00>Oh God, a murder here?</font>

559
00:40:01,212 --> 00:40:02,341
<font color=#ffff00>Alas, madame.</font>

560
00:40:02,556 --> 00:40:04,210
<font color=#ffff00>God rest his soul.</font>

561
00:40:05,288 --> 00:40:08,199
<font color=#ffff00>Someone was rummaging around my
cabin in the middle of the night.</font>

562
00:40:08,508 --> 00:40:10,287
<font color=#ffff00>Nobody would believe me.</font>

563
00:40:12,468 --> 00:40:13,468
<font color=#ffff00>What is going on?</font>

564
00:40:13,548 --> 00:40:15,747
<font color=#ffff00>As we are snowbound, I have
elected to take the case...</font>

565
00:40:16,077 --> 00:40:18,435
<font color=#ffff00>and find for my friend,
Monsieur Bouc, the criminal.</font>

566
00:40:18,637 --> 00:40:19,992
<font color=#ffff00>And why you?</font>

567
00:40:21,277 --> 00:40:23,001
<font color=#ffff00>My name is Hercule Poirot...</font>

568
00:40:23,196 --> 00:40:25,692
<font color=#ffff00>and I'm probably the greatest
detective in the world.</font>

569
00:40:26,290 --> 00:40:28,756
<font color=#ffff00>I will speak to all of you in time.
For the moment...</font>

570
00:40:29,009 --> 00:40:31,648
<font color=#ffff00>I must recommend that you remain in
your compartment with the doors locked.</font>

571
00:40:31,672 --> 00:40:33,179
<font color=#ffff00>I feel like a prisoner here.</font>

572
00:40:33,439 --> 00:40:35,723
<font color=#ffff00>It is for your own safety.</font>

573
00:40:35,902 --> 00:40:37,810
<font color=#ffff00>If there was a murder...</font>

574
00:40:38,076 --> 00:40:39,910
<font color=#ffff00>then there was a murderer.</font>

575
00:40:40,956 --> 00:40:42,593
<font color=#ffff00>The murderer is with us...</font>

576
00:40:43,260 --> 00:40:46,333
<font color=#ffff00>on the train, now.</font>

577
00:40:56,657 --> 00:40:59,706
<font color=#ffff00>The doors between coaches
were locked at night.. hmm?</font>

578
00:40:59,946 --> 00:41:01,541
<font color=#ffff00>Absolutely, done myself.</font>

579
00:41:01,807 --> 00:41:04,217
<font color=#ffff00>The train's been searched.
There is no one hiding on it or under it.</font>

580
00:41:04,241 --> 00:41:08,807
<font color=#ffff00>We can therefore limit our investigation
to the occupants of the Calais coach.</font>

581
00:41:09,007 --> 00:41:10,812
<font color=#ffff00>Bouc, you'll assist me.</font>

582
00:41:11,023 --> 00:41:12,760
<font color=#ffff00>As the only traveler who
slept in another coach..</font>

583
00:41:12,784 --> 00:41:14,443
<font color=#ffff00>You are the only one
who is not a suspect.</font>

584
00:41:22,923 --> 00:41:26,220
<font color=#ffff00>Mr. McQueen, is it
really the time for drinking?</font>

585
00:41:26,460 --> 00:41:28,063
<font color=#ffff00>My boss is dead.</font>

586
00:41:28,303 --> 00:41:31,399
<font color=#ffff00>I am out of the job, and you're
looking at me like I did it.</font>

587
00:41:31,668 --> 00:41:32,948
<font color=#ffff00>We make no accusations.</font>

588
00:41:33,031 --> 00:41:35,500
<font color=#ffff00>You knew him, so from you we
need the essential facts.</font>

589
00:41:35,724 --> 00:41:37,462
<font color=#ffff00>Were you his relative?</font>

590
00:41:38,287 --> 00:41:40,877
<font color=#ffff00>No, his secretary.</font>

591
00:41:42,439 --> 00:41:46,402
<font color=#ffff00>Booked his travel,
ordered his steaks.</font>

592
00:41:46,728 --> 00:41:49,895
<font color=#ffff00>Man ate more steaks than I
have ever seen in my entire life.</font>

593
00:41:50,191 --> 00:41:52,144
<font color=#ffff00>He was in antiques.</font>

594
00:41:52,399 --> 00:41:55,412
<font color=#ffff00>He had no qualifications for it,
not the eye, quite the languages.</font>

595
00:41:55,644 --> 00:41:58,778
<font color=#ffff00>Truth is, he had no head for business,
accounting...</font>

596
00:41:59,052 --> 00:42:00,161
<font color=#ffff00>None of it.</font>

597
00:42:00,463 --> 00:42:01,565
<font color=#ffff00>I took care of everything.</font>

598
00:42:01,788 --> 00:42:04,144
<font color=#ffff00>How long were you in his employ?</font>

599
00:42:04,322 --> 00:42:06,874
<font color=#ffff00>Twenty days short of a year.</font>

600
00:42:07,197 --> 00:42:10,619
<font color=#ffff00>Prohibition wasn't to my taste...</font>

601
00:42:12,539 --> 00:42:15,331
<font color=#ffff00>so I found myself overseas, and in debt.</font>

602
00:42:18,587 --> 00:42:21,042
<font color=#ffff00>I'm a lawyer by education...</font>

603
00:42:21,204 --> 00:42:22,849
<font color=#ffff00>not disposition.</font>

604
00:42:23,138 --> 00:42:25,068
<font color=#ffff00>He was incompetent in that.</font>

605
00:42:25,980 --> 00:42:27,165
<font color=#ffff00>You were fond of him?</font>

606
00:42:27,371 --> 00:42:29,488
<font color=#ffff00>I was fond of his money.</font>

607
00:42:29,776 --> 00:42:30,776
<font color=#ffff00>Ratchett was crude...</font>

608
00:42:31,375 --> 00:42:35,790
<font color=#ffff00><i>demanding, insulting,
and most likely a felon.</i></font>

609
00:42:36,035 --> 00:42:37,650
<font color=#ffff00><i>When did you last see him?</i></font>

610
00:42:37,974 --> 00:42:39,677
<font color=#ffff00><i>It must have been just after 10:00.</i></font>

611
00:42:39,981 --> 00:42:41,862
<font color=#ffff00>He called me in to go over
our sales in Italy.</font>

612
00:42:42,107 --> 00:42:44,449
<font color=#ffff00>Milan, the sale of forgeries?</font>

613
00:42:44,737 --> 00:42:49,020
<font color=#ffff00>Yeah, yeah.
He wanted to look over the accounts.</font>

614
00:42:49,403 --> 00:42:50,895
<font color=#ffff00>I had to translate everything else.</font>

615
00:42:51,169 --> 00:42:53,601
<font color=#ffff00>The contracts were in French
and he didn't speak a word.</font>

616
00:42:54,516 --> 00:42:55,876
<font color=#ffff00><i>And when we stopped at Vinkovci...</i></font>

617
00:42:55,969 --> 00:42:58,427
<font color=#ffff00><i>I struck up a chat with
the colored doctor, Arbuthnot.</i></font>

618
00:42:58,658 --> 00:43:00,618
<font color=#ffff00><i>We had a couple of
drinks, stretch our legs.</i></font>

619
00:43:00,784 --> 00:43:01,784
<font color=#ffff00><i>He had some...</i></font>

620
00:43:01,936 --> 00:43:05,378
<font color=#ffff00>odd opinions about Stalin
I had to turn around.</font>

621
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:09,074
<font color=#ffff00>I don't hold the man's race against him,
but I don't often take the Britishers.</font>

622
00:43:10,044 --> 00:43:11,440
<font color=#ffff00>When did your party end?</font>

623
00:43:11,675 --> 00:43:14,312
<font color=#ffff00>Yeah... He left just after 2:00.</font>

624
00:43:14,512 --> 00:43:17,530
<font color=#ffff00>Did you know of any specific
enemies Ratchett might have had?</font>

625
00:43:17,773 --> 00:43:18,893
<font color=#ffff00>Gosh.</font>

626
00:43:19,170 --> 00:43:20,366
<font color=#ffff00>Pick a number.</font>

627
00:43:20,699 --> 00:43:23,178
<font color=#ffff00>You confide that he have been threatened?</font>

628
00:43:23,387 --> 00:43:25,046
<font color=#ffff00>He got a couple of nasty letters.</font>

629
00:43:25,221 --> 00:43:28,283
<font color=#ffff00>I have them, if you like.
Some, at least.</font>

630
00:43:28,557 --> 00:43:30,503
<font color=#ffff00>He... Threw up the rest.</font>

631
00:43:31,643 --> 00:43:33,252
<font color=#ffff00>He threw them into the fire.</font>

632
00:43:41,719 --> 00:43:43,620
<font color=#ffff00>Merci, Mr. McQueen.</font>

633
00:43:43,931 --> 00:43:44,931
<font color=#ffff00>Thank you.</font>

634
00:43:45,011 --> 00:43:47,820
<font color=#ffff00>If we have any further questions,
we will call for you again.</font>

635
00:43:51,458 --> 00:43:53,834
<font color=#ffff00>Have you consider the Latin man Marquez?</font>

636
00:43:53,934 --> 00:43:55,446
<font color=#ffff00>Hell of a guy man.</font>

637
00:43:56,339 --> 00:43:59,668
<font color=#ffff00>And, well, you know, his kind...</font>

638
00:43:59,830 --> 00:44:03,881
<font color=#ffff00>They don't have the same distest
for murder, historically speaking.</font>

639
00:44:04,067 --> 00:44:06,621
<font color=#ffff00>You said you don't hold a
man's race against him.</font>

640
00:44:06,899 --> 00:44:07,899
<font color=#ffff00>I suppose...</font>

641
00:44:09,236 --> 00:44:11,099
<font color=#ffff00>depends on the race.</font>

642
00:44:17,180 --> 00:44:18,658
<font color=#ffff00>He was doing so well.</font>

643
00:44:18,949 --> 00:44:20,770
<font color=#ffff00>- Do you think it's McQueen?
- Too early to say.</font>

644
00:44:20,794 --> 00:44:23,194
<font color=#ffff00>I admit, I can't see him
stabbing a man 12 times in a frenzy.</font>

645
00:44:23,248 --> 00:44:24,688
<font color=#ffff00>Not sober, any way.
Who did it then?</font>

646
00:44:24,784 --> 00:44:26,224
<font color=#ffff00>I do not know yet.
It's time we ask.</font>

647
00:44:26,498 --> 00:44:28,187
<font color=#ffff00>- Ask? Who?
- The victim.</font>

648
00:45:02,483 --> 00:45:06,627
<font color=#ffff00>He has 12 stab wounds and as
Arbuthnot said they are patternless.</font>

649
00:45:06,918 --> 00:45:07,998
<font color=#ffff00>If the doctor is guilty...</font>

650
00:45:08,218 --> 00:45:10,522
<font color=#ffff00>He certainly didn't let his
influence his responsibility.</font>

651
00:45:10,738 --> 00:45:12,644
<font color=#ffff00>Hey, the watch.
Stopped at 1:15.</font>

652
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:14,690
<font color=#ffff00>That agrees with the the doctor
on the time of death.</font>

653
00:45:14,714 --> 00:45:16,543
<font color=#ffff00>It is possible, yes.
Certainly possible.</font>

654
00:45:16,786 --> 00:45:19,035
<font color=#ffff00>- I don't quite understand.
- Well, I do not understand myself.</font>

655
00:45:19,059 --> 00:45:20,219
<font color=#ffff00>I understand nothing at all.</font>

656
00:45:20,362 --> 00:45:22,150
<font color=#ffff00>If you look at these two wounds...</font>

657
00:45:22,349 --> 00:45:25,249
<font color=#ffff00>They are powerful and deep,
and yet there is little blood.</font>

658
00:45:25,571 --> 00:45:27,917
<font color=#ffff00>But this was a frenzy attack.</font>

659
00:45:28,204 --> 00:45:32,450
<font color=#ffff00>Lashing here and there, no pattern
at all, just extreme violence.</font>

660
00:45:32,724 --> 00:45:36,481
<font color=#ffff00>And during all this, our victim,
vigorous, and anxious and full of coffee...</font>

661
00:45:36,634 --> 00:45:39,709
<font color=#ffff00>merely lies still and accepts
death without struggle...</font>

662
00:45:39,946 --> 00:45:42,457
<font color=#ffff00>when he also has here...</font>

663
00:45:42,766 --> 00:45:45,778
<font color=#ffff00>the means by which he might
defend himself.</font>

664
00:45:46,615 --> 00:45:48,033
<font color=#ffff00>For you.</font>

665
00:45:48,370 --> 00:45:50,739
<font color=#ffff00>Now, let us see.</font>

666
00:45:53,794 --> 00:45:56,818
<font color=#ffff00>Barbital. The mickey sleep.</font>

667
00:45:56,986 --> 00:45:59,135
<font color=#ffff00>They drugged him so
he could not use this.</font>

668
00:46:00,555 --> 00:46:02,668
<font color=#ffff00>And let her around here
a ladies handkerchief.</font>

669
00:46:02,949 --> 00:46:06,310
<font color=#ffff00>An object de luxe, handmade, boom,
two hundred francs in Paris.</font>

670
00:46:06,394 --> 00:46:08,762
<font color=#ffff00>And she even has an initial, "H".</font>

671
00:46:09,005 --> 00:46:12,022
<font color=#ffff00>- And our little friend, the pipe cleaner.
- Another clue.</font>

672
00:46:12,303 --> 00:46:14,996
<font color=#ffff00>Yes, a riot of clues
dropped most conveniently.</font>

673
00:46:15,021 --> 00:46:19,410
<font color=#ffff00>Yet only one appears, however,
to be perhaps genuine.</font>

674
00:46:19,685 --> 00:46:22,377
<font color=#ffff00>And maybe this ashtray provides
the accidental bread crumb.</font>

675
00:46:22,624 --> 00:46:24,442
<font color=#ffff00>The charred fragment of a note.</font>

676
00:46:24,708 --> 00:46:27,602
<font color=#ffff00>An attempt, perhaps,
to burn the evidence.</font>

677
00:46:37,839 --> 00:46:39,239
<font color=#ffff00>He may borrow your
equipment... Yes?</font>

678
00:46:39,307 --> 00:46:40,307
<font color=#ffff00>Thank you.</font>

679
00:46:43,692 --> 00:46:45,857
<font color=#ffff00>Now, I quick up to understand...</font>

680
00:46:46,157 --> 00:46:50,233
<font color=#ffff00>why a clue is left rather than
of what the object is?</font>

681
00:46:52,809 --> 00:46:54,755
<font color=#ffff00>We seek the truth from
within, not with out.</font>

682
00:46:54,989 --> 00:46:59,778
<font color=#ffff00>In this case, however, I may
welcome a little scientific assistance.</font>

683
00:47:00,293 --> 00:47:02,363
<font color=#ffff00>You will adjust the flame.</font>

684
00:47:09,020 --> 00:47:11,493
<font color=#ffff00>Not one of those nasty letters.</font>

685
00:47:12,369 --> 00:47:13,369
<font color=#ffff00>You're mistaken, Mon'Amie</font>

686
00:47:13,585 --> 00:47:15,636
<font color=#ffff00>This one has a secret to tell.</font>

687
00:47:15,969 --> 00:47:16,984
<font color=#ffff00>Look.</font>

688
00:47:21,081 --> 00:47:24,450
<font color=#ffff00><i>"As a strong blood is
on hand, you will die."</i></font>

689
00:47:24,644 --> 00:47:26,184
<font color=#ffff00>What does this mean?</font>

690
00:47:28,695 --> 00:47:30,283
<font color=#ffff00>Come with me, Bouc.</font>

691
00:47:30,874 --> 00:47:32,765
<font color=#ffff00>Let us fill in the gaps.</font>

692
00:47:33,945 --> 00:47:36,249
<font color=#ffff00>This was never a beach side puzzle.</font>

693
00:47:38,381 --> 00:47:40,572
<font color=#ffff00>I know the dead man's real name.</font>

694
00:47:42,002 --> 00:47:46,127
<font color=#ffff00>It is not Ratchett, but Cassetti.</font>

695
00:47:46,435 --> 00:47:47,629
<font color=#ffff00>I know that name.</font>

696
00:47:47,961 --> 00:47:50,133
<font color=#ffff00>Then you will also know the
name Armstrong.</font>

697
00:47:50,414 --> 00:47:52,280
<font color=#ffff00><i>The Armstrong case?</i></font>

698
00:47:52,569 --> 00:47:54,286
<font color=#ffff00><i>History shook the world.</i></font>

699
00:47:54,600 --> 00:47:55,600
<font color=#ffff00><i>Two years ago...</i></font>

700
00:47:55,642 --> 00:47:57,786
<font color=#ffff00><i>the renowned pilot,
Colonel John Armstrong...</i></font>

701
00:47:57,946 --> 00:48:01,659
<font color=#ffff00><i>and his wife, Sonia, woke to find
their only child, little Daisy...</i></font>

702
00:48:06,015 --> 00:48:07,045
<font color=#ffff00><i>Desperate...</i></font>

703
00:48:07,336 --> 00:48:08,870
<font color=#ffff00><i>The Armstrongs paid the ransom.</i></font>

704
00:48:09,196 --> 00:48:12,958
<font color=#ffff00><i>But soon after, Daisy
was found murdered by...</i></font>

705
00:48:13,233 --> 00:48:16,401
<font color=#ffff00><i>Ratchett, who was Cassetti.</i></font>

706
00:48:17,870 --> 00:48:21,398
<font color=#ffff00><i>Sonia Armstrong was with child
when she received the news.</i></font>

707
00:48:21,681 --> 00:48:24,329
<font color=#ffff00><i>The shock sent her into
premature labor.</i></font>

708
00:48:24,633 --> 00:48:27,273
<font color=#ffff00><i>Neither she, nor her baby survived.</i></font>

709
00:48:28,409 --> 00:48:29,817
<font color=#ffff00><i>How do you know this, Poirot?</i></font>

710
00:48:30,017 --> 00:48:32,275
<font color=#ffff00>Because John Armstrong
told me so himself.</font>

711
00:48:32,467 --> 00:48:34,216
<font color=#ffff00>He wrote to me to ask me for my help.</font>

712
00:48:34,449 --> 00:48:36,304
<font color=#ffff00>By the time I received the letter...</font>

713
00:48:37,520 --> 00:48:39,147
<font color=#ffff00>it was too late.</font>

714
00:48:40,942 --> 00:48:43,246
<font color=#ffff00><i>He was found dead of a gunshot wound.</i></font>

715
00:48:44,662 --> 00:48:46,133
<font color=#ffff00><i>Self-inflicted.</i></font>

716
00:48:48,401 --> 00:48:53,457
<font color=#ffff00><i>"Daisy Armstrong's blood is on
your hands, you will die for it."</i></font>

717
00:48:53,736 --> 00:48:56,117
<font color=#ffff00>Indeed you did.</font>

718
00:48:56,284 --> 00:48:57,945
<font color=#ffff00>- Monsieur Poirot?
- Yes, Michel.</font>

719
00:48:58,272 --> 00:49:01,695
<font color=#ffff00>Mrs. Hubbard wants to talk to you.
I held her as best as I could.</font>

720
00:49:02,596 --> 00:49:05,056
<font color=#ffff00>Uh. Mrs. Hubbard, I am
sorry to have kept you.</font>

721
00:49:05,241 --> 00:49:07,367
<font color=#ffff00>You have a head full of steam
and a mouth full of words.</font>

722
00:49:07,391 --> 00:49:09,471
<font color=#ffff00>You goddamn right I do.
What I have been trying to...</font>

723
00:49:09,681 --> 00:49:11,303
<font color=#ffff00>to tell you all day.</font>

724
00:49:11,649 --> 00:49:15,033
<font color=#ffff00>The murderer with in my
compartment last night.</font>

725
00:49:15,561 --> 00:49:17,881
<font color=#ffff00>I thought I would be killed.
Turns out I might have been...</font>

726
00:49:17,953 --> 00:49:20,516
<font color=#ffff00>Only he got Rachette instead.</font>

727
00:49:20,696 --> 00:49:23,056
<font color=#ffff00>I woke up in the dark and I knew
there was a man in my room.</font>

728
00:49:23,696 --> 00:49:25,444
<font color=#ffff00>You were certain it was a man?</font>

729
00:49:26,169 --> 00:49:28,794
<font color=#ffff00>I know what it feels like
to have a man in my bedroom.</font>

730
00:49:29,471 --> 00:49:32,107
<font color=#ffff00>I told your conductor, and he
wouldn't believe me.</font>

731
00:49:32,355 --> 00:49:35,116
<font color=#ffff00>I said, "Check the communicating door
between my room and Ratchett's."</font>

732
00:49:35,176 --> 00:49:36,974
<font color=#ffff00>"He must have left through there."</font>

733
00:49:37,209 --> 00:49:39,705
<font color=#ffff00>Sure enough, it was unbolted.</font>

734
00:49:40,281 --> 00:49:41,361
<font color=#ffff00>I know I locked it after...</font>

735
00:49:41,507 --> 00:49:43,278
<font color=#ffff00>what Ratchett said.</font>

736
00:49:43,531 --> 00:49:46,750
<font color=#ffff00>He made a rather
daring proposal.</font>

737
00:49:47,574 --> 00:49:48,819
<font color=#ffff00>Have you perhaps...?</font>

738
00:49:49,070 --> 00:49:51,512
<font color=#ffff00>Heard about the
Armstrong kidnapping?</font>

739
00:49:52,755 --> 00:49:54,071
<font color=#ffff00>You couldn't avoid it.</font>

740
00:49:54,413 --> 00:49:55,523
<font color=#ffff00>Morbid stuff.</font>

741
00:49:55,832 --> 00:49:57,592
<font color=#ffff00>The child's murderer, Cassetti...</font>

742
00:49:58,584 --> 00:50:00,201
<font color=#ffff00>died last night.</font>

743
00:50:00,488 --> 00:50:02,649
<font color=#ffff00>Ratchett was that man.</font>

744
00:50:03,640 --> 00:50:07,086
<font color=#ffff00>I told you, I knew
he was a rotten one.</font>

745
00:50:08,653 --> 00:50:09,653
<font color=#ffff00>You do believe me...?</font>

746
00:50:09,723 --> 00:50:11,725
<font color=#ffff00>About the man in my room?</font>

747
00:50:11,959 --> 00:50:13,855
<font color=#ffff00>I am aware that you
think I'm a silly woman.</font>

748
00:50:14,101 --> 00:50:16,090
<font color=#ffff00>But I have proof that it's true.</font>

749
00:50:22,483 --> 00:50:24,878
<font color=#ffff00>Might have fallen off Michel
when he was in your room.</font>

750
00:50:26,133 --> 00:50:27,133
<font color=#ffff00>I'm not missing it.</font>

751
00:50:27,331 --> 00:50:29,299
<font color=#ffff00>I found it at the foot of
my bed, on the cover...</font>

752
00:50:29,550 --> 00:50:31,213
<font color=#ffff00>right where I slept.</font>

753
00:50:31,443 --> 00:50:32,443
<font color=#ffff00>What do you call that?</font>

754
00:50:32,611 --> 00:50:34,851
<font color=#ffff00>I call it evidence.
Thank you very much, Mrs. Hubbard.</font>

755
00:50:40,254 --> 00:50:41,581
<font color=#ffff00>Have you ever been to America?</font>

756
00:50:41,848 --> 00:50:43,329
<font color=#ffff00>Once.</font>

757
00:50:43,477 --> 00:50:45,016
<font color=#ffff00>Years ago, briefly.</font>

758
00:50:45,314 --> 00:50:46,892
<font color=#ffff00>For what purpose?</font>

759
00:50:47,096 --> 00:50:49,110
<font color=#ffff00>- To confirm a suspicion.
- Which was?</font>

760
00:50:49,331 --> 00:50:50,558
<font color=#ffff00>That I wouldn't like it.</font>

761
00:50:50,840 --> 00:50:52,300
<font color=#ffff00>I was offered a post in Boston.</font>

762
00:50:52,590 --> 00:50:54,270
<font color=#ffff00>From Boston went straight back to London.</font>

763
00:50:54,349 --> 00:50:56,851
<font color=#ffff00>- Is that where Rachette was from? Boston?
- I don't know.</font>

764
00:50:58,224 --> 00:50:59,289
<font color=#ffff00>It wouldn't be proper...</font>

765
00:50:59,819 --> 00:51:01,020
<font color=#ffff00>to ask.</font>

766
00:51:02,936 --> 00:51:03,936
<font color=#ffff00>Carry on.</font>

767
00:51:04,067 --> 00:51:05,304
<font color=#ffff00>The last I saw...</font>

768
00:51:05,570 --> 00:51:08,618
<font color=#ffff00>Mr. Ratchett at nine o'clock.</font>

769
00:51:08,781 --> 00:51:12,572
<font color=#ffff00>I brought his coffee and
hung up his clothes.</font>

770
00:51:17,037 --> 00:51:19,335
<font color=#ffff00>You have the tooth ache I think.</font>

771
00:51:20,268 --> 00:51:22,308
<font color=#ffff00>I have got an extraction
booked in London this week.</font>

772
00:51:22,366 --> 00:51:25,630
<font color=#ffff00>Mr. Ratchett insisted on not
putting it off any longer.</font>

773
00:51:25,908 --> 00:51:28,102
<font color=#ffff00>He said he was tired of hearing
my suppressed groans.</font>

774
00:51:28,376 --> 00:51:29,416
<font color=#ffff00>This sympathetic Ratchett?</font>

775
00:51:29,549 --> 00:51:31,885
<font color=#ffff00>Was it his usual practice
to drink coffee at night?</font>

776
00:51:32,216 --> 00:51:36,124
<font color=#ffff00>Not at all.
But he had been very agitated lately.</font>

777
00:51:36,440 --> 00:51:40,108
<font color=#ffff00>He said he wanted to stay alert.
Especially through the last night.</font>

778
00:51:40,343 --> 00:51:42,556
<font color=#ffff00>He found a letter in his compartment.</font>

779
00:51:43,789 --> 00:51:45,532
<font color=#ffff00>Please tell me you didn't do this.</font>

780
00:51:45,841 --> 00:51:48,344
<font color=#ffff00>If I am to leave something
unpleasant on your pillow, sir...</font>

781
00:51:48,609 --> 00:51:50,018
<font color=#ffff00>It would not be a letter.</font>

782
00:51:51,141 --> 00:51:52,337
<font color=#ffff00>Coffee.</font>

783
00:51:55,016 --> 00:51:56,079
<font color=#ffff00><i>Surely such a...</i></font>

784
00:51:56,587 --> 00:51:59,138
<font color=#ffff00>profound and precise valet...</font>

785
00:51:59,419 --> 00:52:01,139
<font color=#ffff00>would never speak to his master
how you did.</font>

786
00:52:02,196 --> 00:52:06,316
<font color=#ffff00>Unless he knew his career was
coming to a sudden...</font>

787
00:52:07,544 --> 00:52:08,958
<font color=#ffff00>End.</font>

788
00:52:10,487 --> 00:52:12,982
<font color=#ffff00>Not mere tooth ache I think.</font>

789
00:52:14,168 --> 00:52:15,168
<font color=#ffff00>The lungs?</font>

790
00:52:17,911 --> 00:52:19,260
<font color=#ffff00>The thyroid.</font>

791
00:52:20,162 --> 00:52:23,767
<font color=#ffff00>Spread now to stomach.
Ends with my father, five years younger.</font>

792
00:52:25,548 --> 00:52:26,988
<font color=#ffff00>Months have passed.</font>

793
00:52:28,739 --> 00:52:30,604
<font color=#ffff00>"Inoperable, I am afraid,"
said the doctor.</font>

794
00:52:30,771 --> 00:52:33,591
<font color=#ffff00>Suddenly I wasn't afraid.</font>

795
00:52:34,424 --> 00:52:37,278
<font color=#ffff00>I would only do what I wanted.</font>

796
00:52:37,515 --> 00:52:38,515
<font color=#ffff00>I speak my mind now.</font>

797
00:52:39,992 --> 00:52:41,113
<font color=#ffff00>The coffee.</font>

798
00:52:41,815 --> 00:52:43,807
<font color=#ffff00>It appears that his cup was
mixed with the Barbital.</font>

799
00:52:43,831 --> 00:52:45,872
<font color=#ffff00>You of course, would tell me
that you did not put it in there.</font>

800
00:52:45,896 --> 00:52:46,896
<font color=#ffff00>Of course I did not.</font>

801
00:52:47,340 --> 00:52:50,209
<font color=#ffff00>When and from where did you
procure the coffee and the cups?</font>

802
00:52:50,797 --> 00:52:51,939
<font color=#ffff00>In the kitchen, sir.</font>

803
00:52:52,269 --> 00:52:56,151
<font color=#ffff00>I ordered it at dinner to be
ready at 9, and so it was.</font>

804
00:52:56,439 --> 00:52:59,415
<font color=#ffff00>Anyone could have
got hold of it before me.</font>

805
00:53:06,903 --> 00:53:08,406
<font color=#ffff00>Mr. Masterman.</font>

806
00:53:08,908 --> 00:53:10,774
<font color=#ffff00>I'm sorry about the tooth ache.</font>

807
00:53:20,548 --> 00:53:22,289
<font color=#ffff00>I love the little cakes.</font>

808
00:53:23,763 --> 00:53:25,965
<font color=#ffff00>So, Miss Pilar Estravados,
you are a missionary...</font>

809
00:53:26,263 --> 00:53:28,823
<font color=#ffff00>but you've trained as a nurse
before you change profession, yes?</font>

810
00:53:29,378 --> 00:53:30,620
<font color=#ffff00>I owed it to God.</font>

811
00:53:30,876 --> 00:53:33,063
<font color=#ffff00>You owed him a debt?</font>

812
00:53:34,420 --> 00:53:35,946
<font color=#ffff00>There were...</font>

813
00:53:37,634 --> 00:53:40,279
<font color=#ffff00>indulgent times in my life...</font>

814
00:53:41,239 --> 00:53:44,578
<font color=#ffff00>when I took more than I gave.</font>

815
00:53:44,892 --> 00:53:45,987
<font color=#ffff00><i>Gerhard Hardman.</i></font>

816
00:53:46,208 --> 00:53:48,698
<font color=#ffff00>Professor of Engineering.</font>

817
00:53:48,936 --> 00:53:53,183
<font color=#ffff00>It is science that will
win back for Germany her pride.</font>

818
00:53:54,263 --> 00:53:57,949
<font color=#ffff00>Mr. Marquez, listen, I want to be clear
of any association with the crime...</font>

819
00:53:58,237 --> 00:53:59,277
<font color=#ffff00>so please ask me anything.</font>

820
00:53:59,368 --> 00:54:01,453
<font color=#ffff00>Anything, I never lie anymore.</font>

821
00:54:01,699 --> 00:54:03,619
<font color=#ffff00>Did you leave your compartment
at all last night?</font>

822
00:54:03,799 --> 00:54:06,684
<font color=#ffff00>Only once, to get an aspirin.</font>

823
00:54:07,020 --> 00:54:09,409
<font color=#ffff00>Mrs. Hubbard offered me something earlier.</font>

824
00:54:09,599 --> 00:54:11,479
<font color=#ffff00>I declined it first
but when I could not rest...</font>

825
00:54:11,661 --> 00:54:13,174
<font color=#ffff00>I went to ask for it.</font>

826
00:54:13,425 --> 00:54:15,524
<font color=#ffff00>My conference is in Turin.</font>

827
00:54:15,703 --> 00:54:19,063
<font color=#ffff00>I am the only Austrian
to present, which means without me...</font>

828
00:54:19,414 --> 00:54:21,266
<font color=#ffff00>the talks would be sub standard.</font>

829
00:54:21,559 --> 00:54:24,331
<font color=#ffff00>Then I escaped prison, and I drived myself
into the United States...</font>

830
00:54:24,585 --> 00:54:26,838
<font color=#ffff00>where I swore never to
lie or steal again.</font>

831
00:54:27,126 --> 00:54:29,726
<font color=#ffff00>You see my friends, because when
people trust you, they buy more.</font>

832
00:54:29,935 --> 00:54:33,391
<font color=#ffff00>The Italians are cows.
The Spaniards, sheep.</font>

833
00:54:33,559 --> 00:54:35,199
<font color=#ffff00>The Belgians...</font>

834
00:54:36,919 --> 00:54:41,242
<font color=#ffff00>Nothing, I come to my room, which I share
with the unhappy English butler.</font>

835
00:54:41,527 --> 00:54:43,686
<font color=#ffff00>Annoying? He... Groans a lot.</font>

836
00:54:43,927 --> 00:54:46,519
<font color=#ffff00>But I am sure he saw me sleep
all night until morning.</font>

837
00:54:47,326 --> 00:54:48,326
<font color=#ffff00>I should say...</font>

838
00:54:48,569 --> 00:54:50,956
<font color=#ffff00>in case it is relevant.</font>

839
00:54:51,222 --> 00:54:53,430
<font color=#ffff00>There was an embarrassing moment.</font>

840
00:54:53,657 --> 00:54:55,450
<font color=#ffff00>When I went to see Mrs. Hubbard...</font>

841
00:54:55,734 --> 00:54:57,462
<font color=#ffff00>first I opened the wrong door.</font>

842
00:54:58,422 --> 00:54:59,855
<font color=#ffff00>I am sorry.</font>

843
00:55:00,150 --> 00:55:01,153
<font color=#ffff00><i>What time was this?</i></font>

844
00:55:01,408 --> 00:55:02,599
<font color=#ffff00><i>That must have been about...</i></font>

845
00:55:02,848 --> 00:55:03,991
<font color=#ffff00>Don't be sorry.</font>

846
00:55:04,993 --> 00:55:06,817
<font color=#ffff00>Twenty minutes to 11:00.</font>

847
00:55:07,692 --> 00:55:09,545
<font color=#ffff00>This is interesting.</font>

848
00:55:09,805 --> 00:55:13,591
<font color=#ffff00>As far as it is known, you was the
last person to see Ratchett alive.</font>

849
00:55:15,722 --> 00:55:17,206
<font color=#ffff00>- Your business?
- Automobiles.</font>

850
00:55:17,377 --> 00:55:18,617
<font color=#ffff00>I have three showrooms.</font>

851
00:55:18,853 --> 00:55:21,746
<font color=#ffff00>I come to America with nothing.
And now...</font>

852
00:55:21,995 --> 00:55:24,030
<font color=#ffff00>If what you say is true, Miss
Debnham will confirm it.</font>

853
00:55:24,054 --> 00:55:25,824
<font color=#ffff00>But it is true.</font>

854
00:55:26,070 --> 00:55:28,086
<font color=#ffff00>I would not lie.</font>

855
00:55:28,224 --> 00:55:29,650
<font color=#ffff00>I would not lie.</font>

856
00:55:29,910 --> 00:55:33,110
<font color=#ffff00>May it be possible that Miss Debenham left
your compartment without you noticing?</font>

857
00:55:33,463 --> 00:55:35,915
<font color=#ffff00>No. I sleep very lightly.</font>

858
00:55:36,107 --> 00:55:38,870
<font color=#ffff00>With the slightest sound
I woke up right.</font>

859
00:55:40,811 --> 00:55:42,629
<font color=#ffff00>I was surprised once.</font>

860
00:55:44,310 --> 00:55:46,152
<font color=#ffff00>Never again.</font>

861
00:55:46,342 --> 00:55:48,009
<font color=#ffff00>No, I didn't say I was a chauffeur.</font>

862
00:55:48,323 --> 00:55:50,624
<font color=#ffff00>The photographs that spilled
out of your luggage..</font>

863
00:55:50,837 --> 00:55:54,529
<font color=#ffff00>There was a beautiful one, the
little boy, wearing a chauffeur's hat...</font>

864
00:55:54,816 --> 00:55:56,286
<font color=#ffff00>visiting his papa at work.</font>

865
00:55:56,310 --> 00:55:57,715
<font color=#ffff00>Who did you chauffeur?</font>

866
00:55:59,037 --> 00:56:01,975
<font color=#ffff00>Ms. Estrada, why do your
hands have a calluses of a boxer?</font>

867
00:56:02,249 --> 00:56:03,916
<font color=#ffff00>I do my work in dangerous cities...</font>

868
00:56:04,849 --> 00:56:06,866
<font color=#ffff00>where I can not be governed by fear.</font>

869
00:56:07,542 --> 00:56:08,542
<font color=#ffff00>I trained to fight.</font>

870
00:56:08,612 --> 00:56:10,244
<font color=#ffff00>But you do not you trust your God anymore?</font>

871
00:56:10,268 --> 00:56:11,494
<font color=#ffff00>Since you had surprise?</font>

872
00:56:11,832 --> 00:56:14,089
<font color=#ffff00>No, in case he is busy.</font>

873
00:56:14,688 --> 00:56:16,259
<font color=#ffff00>God is always busy.</font>

874
00:56:17,152 --> 00:56:18,403
<font color=#ffff00><i>It's Masterman.</i></font>

875
00:56:18,546 --> 00:56:20,229
<font color=#ffff00>A man dying he is the man
with nothing to lose.</font>

876
00:56:20,253 --> 00:56:22,302
<font color=#ffff00>Bravo, Bouc.
Except for the problem of Mr. Marquez...</font>

877
00:56:22,326 --> 00:56:24,446
<font color=#ffff00>who has now confirmed that his
bunk mate, Masterman...</font>

878
00:56:24,693 --> 00:56:27,298
<font color=#ffff00>was reading in his bed
at the time of death.</font>

879
00:56:27,563 --> 00:56:29,801
<font color=#ffff00>If it were easy, I would not be famous.
Next.</font>

880
00:56:38,112 --> 00:56:39,112
<font color=#ffff00>Miss Debenham...</font>

881
00:56:39,233 --> 00:56:40,633
<font color=#ffff00>You do not mind to brace the air?</font>

882
00:56:40,979 --> 00:56:42,438
<font color=#ffff00>For you, we have the picnic.</font>

883
00:56:43,701 --> 00:56:47,031
<font color=#ffff00>Oh, you made my room mate
suffer cramped... I see.</font>

884
00:56:47,328 --> 00:56:49,848
<font color=#ffff00>Use the best location to extract
the truth from each suspect.</font>

885
00:56:50,060 --> 00:56:51,747
<font color=#ffff00>Put her off balance, me freeze.</font>

886
00:56:52,278 --> 00:56:53,278
<font color=#ffff00>Clever.</font>

887
00:56:53,400 --> 00:56:56,127
<font color=#ffff00>Will you write on your full
name and address please?</font>

888
00:56:56,362 --> 00:56:57,892
<font color=#ffff00>A pale move by the way.</font>

889
00:56:58,133 --> 00:57:00,951
<font color=#ffff00>Ms. Estravados told me you
asked the the color of her dressing gown.</font>

890
00:57:05,195 --> 00:57:07,392
<font color=#ffff00><i>"Mary Hermione Debenham."</i></font>

891
00:57:07,949 --> 00:57:09,940
<font color=#ffff00>Do you ever go by Hermione?</font>

892
00:57:10,198 --> 00:57:14,166
<font color=#ffff00>A constant Marry when I'm not employed
as "Miss Debenham." Left-handed.</font>

893
00:57:15,030 --> 00:57:17,138
<font color=#ffff00>Unusual, I know.</font>

894
00:57:17,334 --> 00:57:20,054
<font color=#ffff00>You mustn't have your theory fixed
if you are testing my handwriting.</font>

895
00:57:20,266 --> 00:57:22,037
<font color=#ffff00>What did you think of the dead man?</font>

896
00:57:22,677 --> 00:57:25,397
<font color=#ffff00>I can't say. I didn't
think about him.</font>

897
00:57:27,089 --> 00:57:28,381
<font color=#ffff00>Don't quite see the point of your question.</font>

898
00:57:28,405 --> 00:57:32,267
<font color=#ffff00>Forgive me, mademoiselle, they
are my little originalities.</font>

899
00:57:33,750 --> 00:57:35,986
<font color=#ffff00>Human nature is perverse
in its complexity.</font>

900
00:57:36,205 --> 00:57:39,712
<font color=#ffff00>To plumb it, it takes the right tools.</font>

901
00:57:40,051 --> 00:57:41,622
<font color=#ffff00>These are toys, not tools, Hercule.</font>

902
00:57:42,171 --> 00:57:43,408
<font color=#ffff00>And I prefer that you put them away.</font>

903
00:57:43,432 --> 00:57:44,959
<font color=#ffff00>The direct method? Parfait.</font>

904
00:57:45,193 --> 00:57:47,157
<font color=#ffff00>You knew the doctor before traveling?</font>

905
00:57:47,477 --> 00:57:48,477
<font color=#ffff00>Dr. Arbuthnot?</font>

906
00:57:50,144 --> 00:57:51,144
<font color=#ffff00>No.</font>

907
00:57:53,621 --> 00:57:55,445
<font color=#ffff00>But such an instant attraction?</font>

908
00:57:58,824 --> 00:57:59,984
<font color=#ffff00>We are not in America...</font>

909
00:58:00,323 --> 00:58:03,844
<font color=#ffff00>Miss Debenham. There are
no laws against what you may feel.</font>

910
00:58:07,073 --> 00:58:09,989
<font color=#ffff00>Nor are there laws against
silence, of which...</font>

911
00:58:10,230 --> 00:58:11,639
<font color=#ffff00>I'm hold my...</font>

912
00:58:14,143 --> 00:58:16,136
<font color=#ffff00>I have never been to America.</font>

913
00:58:18,052 --> 00:58:21,948
<font color=#ffff00>Perhaps I may ask about some...</font>

914
00:58:22,200 --> 00:58:23,200
<font color=#ffff00>words I've overheard?</font>

915
00:58:23,477 --> 00:58:27,251
<font color=#ffff00>You and the stranger, Arbuthnot,
are closer than strangers might be.</font>

916
00:58:27,509 --> 00:58:29,311
<font color=#ffff00>You said:</font>

917
00:58:29,549 --> 00:58:33,626
<font color=#ffff00>"Not now, when we're done,
then no one can touch us"</font>

918
00:58:33,865 --> 00:58:35,288
<font color=#ffff00>What did you mean?</font>

919
00:58:36,766 --> 00:58:39,349
<font color=#ffff00>Do you think I made a murder?</font>

920
00:58:39,574 --> 00:58:42,197
<font color=#ffff00>To a man with a hammer,
every problem is a nail.</font>

921
00:58:42,412 --> 00:58:43,944
<font color=#ffff00>You live crime.</font>

922
00:58:44,156 --> 00:58:46,141
<font color=#ffff00>- You see evil every day.
- No so.</font>

923
00:58:46,325 --> 00:58:50,661
<font color=#ffff00>I see enough crimes to know that
the criminal act is the anomaly.</font>

924
00:58:50,814 --> 00:58:53,504
<font color=#ffff00>I think it takes a fracture
off with a soul...</font>

925
00:58:54,128 --> 00:58:56,405
<font color=#ffff00>to murder another human being.</font>

926
00:58:58,785 --> 00:59:01,548
<font color=#ffff00>I ask again, what did you mean?</font>

927
00:59:03,837 --> 00:59:05,641
<font color=#ffff00>As we established...</font>

928
00:59:05,813 --> 00:59:08,409
<font color=#ffff00>there are no laws against my silence.</font>

929
00:59:10,325 --> 00:59:11,669
<font color=#ffff00>Very well.</font>

930
00:59:21,246 --> 00:59:23,772
<font color=#ffff00><i>And afterward, Princess Dragomiroff?</i></font>

931
00:59:23,999 --> 00:59:26,217
<font color=#ffff00>After dinner, I went to bed.</font>

932
00:59:27,307 --> 00:59:29,169
<font color=#ffff00>God blessed me with long life...</font>

933
00:59:29,908 --> 00:59:33,054
<font color=#ffff00>but cursed me with a bad back
to make it miserable.</font>

934
00:59:33,890 --> 00:59:36,190
<font color=#ffff00>About close to 1:00...</font>

935
00:59:36,383 --> 00:59:38,165
<font color=#ffff00>I called for Fr√oulein Schmidt.</font>

936
00:59:38,367 --> 00:59:39,367
<font color=#ffff00>She massaged me...</font>

937
00:59:39,562 --> 00:59:41,621
<font color=#ffff00>and read me for a while. Then I sleep.</font>

938
00:59:43,104 --> 00:59:44,384
<font color=#ffff00>Were you ever acquainted with...</font>

939
00:59:44,429 --> 00:59:47,489
<font color=#ffff00>a family by the name of Armstrong?</font>

940
00:59:54,676 --> 00:59:58,040
<font color=#ffff00>They endured an unspeakable tragedy.</font>

941
00:59:58,214 --> 01:00:01,531
<font color=#ffff00>I was an admirer of Sonia
Armstrong's mother...</font>

942
01:00:01,691 --> 01:00:03,699
<font color=#ffff00>Linda Arden, the actress.</font>

943
01:00:04,012 --> 01:00:06,805
<font color=#ffff00>A once a century talent.</font>

944
01:00:07,829 --> 01:00:10,771
<font color=#ffff00>Miss Arden was to do acting.</font>

945
01:00:11,434 --> 01:00:15,378
<font color=#ffff00>She would have become the first
woman titan of Broadway...</font>

946
01:00:15,639 --> 01:00:17,420
<font color=#ffff00>were it not for the tragedy.</font>

947
01:00:17,673 --> 01:00:21,051
<font color=#ffff00>And this, Linda Arden, she's dead?</font>

948
01:00:21,307 --> 01:00:22,961
<font color=#ffff00>She might as well be.</font>

949
01:00:23,927 --> 01:00:25,418
<font color=#ffff00>She no longer leaves her home.</font>

950
01:00:27,911 --> 01:00:30,334
<font color=#ffff00>Daisy was my goddaughter.</font>

951
01:00:31,543 --> 01:00:33,281
<font color=#ffff00>She was...</font>

952
01:00:43,445 --> 01:00:46,202
<font color=#ffff00>I don's see how this relates
to our trouble, detective.</font>

953
01:00:46,302 --> 01:00:50,011
<font color=#ffff00>The man, killed last night,
his true name was Cassetti.</font>

954
01:00:50,260 --> 01:00:53,167
<font color=#ffff00>The man who murdered
little Daisy Armstrong.</font>

955
01:00:58,324 --> 01:00:59,789
<font color=#ffff00>I see.</font>

956
01:01:00,062 --> 01:01:03,043
<font color=#ffff00>I admit, I know this family,
and now that man is dead.</font>

957
01:01:03,945 --> 01:01:05,001
<font color=#ffff00>The coincidence...</font>

958
01:01:05,082 --> 01:01:07,349
<font color=#ffff00>must seem unbearable.</font>

959
01:01:08,141 --> 01:01:10,863
<font color=#ffff00>You may be permitted a coincidence.</font>

960
01:01:12,751 --> 01:01:15,652
<font color=#ffff00>I must now ask a few questions
of you Froulein Schmidt.</font>

961
01:01:15,840 --> 01:01:16,903
<font color=#ffff00>No, there is no need.</font>

962
01:01:17,236 --> 01:01:18,580
<font color=#ffff00>I can answer to her character.</font>

963
01:01:18,836 --> 01:01:21,065
<font color=#ffff00>Even still, if you will allow.</font>

964
01:01:22,193 --> 01:01:24,047
<font color=#ffff00><i>Froulein Please answer in German.</i></font>

965
01:01:24,335 --> 01:01:26,206
<font color=#ffff00><i>But your Excellency does not understand.</i></font>

966
01:01:27,124 --> 01:01:28,370
<font color=#ffff00><i>That's what it is about.</i></font>

967
01:01:32,527 --> 01:01:34,286
<font color=#ffff00><i>Is this yours?
H of Hildegarde?</i></font>

968
01:01:37,288 --> 01:01:39,170
<font color=#ffff00>That is silk.
It's too fine for me.</font>

969
01:01:40,936 --> 01:01:42,795
<font color=#ffff00><i>Is this the truth about last night?</i></font>

970
01:01:43,914 --> 01:01:48,088
<font color=#ffff00><i>As she said.
She sent the inspector to look for me...</i></font>

971
01:01:48,606 --> 01:01:49,672
<font color=#ffff00><i>Then I went back to bed.</i></font>

972
01:01:50,401 --> 01:01:51,881
<font color=#ffff00><i>Did you see someone when he returned?</i></font>

973
01:01:52,180 --> 01:01:53,725
<font color=#ffff00><i>Only the other inspector.</i></font>

974
01:01:54,385 --> 01:01:55,627
<font color=#ffff00><i>One who was...</i></font>

975
01:01:55,727 --> 01:01:57,407
<font color=#ffff00>"The other conductor."
You mean Michel?</font>

976
01:01:57,982 --> 01:01:59,316
<font color=#ffff00>No. A different one.</font>

977
01:02:00,748 --> 01:02:01,748
<font color=#ffff00>Please come.</font>

978
01:02:03,883 --> 01:02:05,163
<font color=#ffff00>Are you sure you didn't see him?</font>

979
01:02:05,227 --> 01:02:07,463
<font color=#ffff00>I'm certain. The other conductor was a
small man with a short beard.</font>

980
01:02:07,487 --> 01:02:08,642
<font color=#ffff00>Froulein, there is no other conductor.</font>

981
01:02:08,666 --> 01:02:09,666
<font color=#ffff00>I know what I saw.</font>

982
01:02:09,801 --> 01:02:12,433
<font color=#ffff00>I remember because his voice was high
and the uniform was same exactly.</font>

983
01:02:12,457 --> 01:02:14,070
<font color=#ffff00>Although I suspect missing one button.</font>

984
01:02:14,206 --> 01:02:15,726
<font color=#ffff00>Sir, I need your pass key immediately.</font>

985
01:02:15,934 --> 01:02:19,536
<font color=#ffff00>We need to find a uniform
and a red kimono.</font>

986
01:02:19,678 --> 01:02:21,939
<font color=#ffff00>Thousands of photographs,
any less pair of socks...</font>

987
01:02:22,259 --> 01:02:24,019
<font color=#ffff00>Dressing gowns in every colors, but red...</font>

988
01:02:24,245 --> 01:02:25,885
<font color=#ffff00>still no contraband conduct his uniform.</font>

989
01:02:26,110 --> 01:02:28,376
<font color=#ffff00>Have we already checked all the
passenger of luggage?</font>

990
01:02:28,606 --> 01:02:31,205
<font color=#ffff00>All except for the Count and
the Countess Andrenyi, monsieur.</font>

991
01:02:31,229 --> 01:02:32,987
<font color=#ffff00>It is forbidden to search their suitcases.</font>

992
01:02:33,299 --> 01:02:34,938
<font color=#ffff00>They travel under diplomatic visas.</font>

993
01:02:35,187 --> 01:02:36,926
<font color=#ffff00>Where else could be?</font>

994
01:02:37,129 --> 01:02:40,157
<font color=#ffff00>There is one last suitcase
we have not checked.</font>

995
01:02:41,395 --> 01:02:42,395
<font color=#ffff00>My own.</font>

996
01:02:46,996 --> 01:02:49,067
<font color=#ffff00>The killer is mocking me.</font>

997
01:02:49,300 --> 01:02:50,859
<font color=#ffff00>Good. His first mistake.</font>

998
01:02:51,124 --> 01:02:53,950
<font color=#ffff00>And as the night must follow the day...</font>

999
01:02:59,763 --> 01:03:01,911
<font color=#ffff00>No, it's not mine.</font>

1000
01:03:02,211 --> 01:03:03,331
<font color=#ffff00>I told you of the conductor.</font>

1001
01:03:03,443 --> 01:03:05,127
<font color=#ffff00>- Why would I tell you if it was me?
- You would not...</font>

1002
01:03:05,151 --> 01:03:07,294
<font color=#ffff00>which makes your compartment
the ideal place to hide it.</font>

1003
01:03:07,318 --> 01:03:08,348
<font color=#ffff00>Voila, the button.</font>

1004
01:03:08,714 --> 01:03:11,164
<font color=#ffff00>And if the conductor's uniform...</font>

1005
01:03:11,389 --> 01:03:16,075
<font color=#ffff00>Why not a conductor's pass key?</font>

1006
01:03:16,414 --> 01:03:19,999
<font color=#ffff00>Now we know how the killer
magically passed through locked doors.</font>

1007
01:03:24,137 --> 01:03:25,772
<font color=#ffff00>- Bourbon.
- McQueen.</font>

1008
01:03:27,978 --> 01:03:29,019
<font color=#ffff00>Now what are we looking for?</font>

1009
01:03:29,043 --> 01:03:30,043
<font color=#ffff00>Five hundred pounds.</font>

1010
01:03:30,387 --> 01:03:32,849
<font color=#ffff00>McQueen also had a ledger
all his dealings with Rachette.</font>

1011
01:03:33,007 --> 01:03:34,572
<font color=#ffff00>Where is it?</font>

1012
01:03:37,972 --> 01:03:38,972
<font color=#ffff00>Poirot?</font>

1013
01:03:41,257 --> 01:03:43,358
<font color=#ffff00>Bouc, keep everyone inside!</font>

1014
01:03:44,979 --> 01:03:46,045
<font color=#ffff00>Please, stop!</font>

1015
01:04:20,840 --> 01:04:22,127
<font color=#ffff00>Mossier, stay where you are.</font>

1016
01:04:33,372 --> 01:04:35,454
<font color=#ffff00>Thank you gentlemen. Thank you.</font>

1017
01:04:44,499 --> 01:04:47,271
<font color=#ffff00>So, it was McQueen?
You have your man?</font>

1018
01:04:48,986 --> 01:04:50,706
<font color=#ffff00>How could he?</font>

1019
01:04:51,005 --> 01:04:52,005
<font color=#ffff00><i>I didn't kill him?!</i></font>

1020
01:04:52,145 --> 01:04:53,307
<font color=#ffff00><i>You tried to burn Rachette's accounts...</i></font>

1021
01:04:53,331 --> 01:04:55,728
<font color=#ffff00>but there are illegibly places.
The maths do not tally...</font>

1022
01:04:55,752 --> 01:04:57,352
<font color=#ffff00>because you have been
stealing from him.</font>

1023
01:04:57,422 --> 01:04:58,759
<font color=#ffff00>It is full of the...</font>

1024
01:04:59,048 --> 01:05:02,078
<font color=#ffff00>The... The English word?
The chocolate?</font>

1025
01:05:02,301 --> 01:05:04,445
<font color=#ffff00>- Fudge?
- Fudge. It is full of the fudge.</font>

1026
01:05:04,703 --> 01:05:06,364
<font color=#ffff00>You stole from him.</font>

1027
01:05:06,617 --> 01:05:08,071
<font color=#ffff00>You thought you would be found out.</font>

1028
01:05:08,275 --> 01:05:10,248
<font color=#ffff00>That is why you killed him!</font>

1029
01:05:10,446 --> 01:05:11,446
<font color=#ffff00>Yeah.</font>

1030
01:05:12,555 --> 01:05:15,803
<font color=#ffff00>Yeah, you are damn right,
I stole from him.</font>

1031
01:05:15,987 --> 01:05:17,181
<font color=#ffff00>Thousands.</font>

1032
01:05:18,191 --> 01:05:20,739
<font color=#ffff00>I knew his money wasn't honest.</font>

1033
01:05:20,979 --> 01:05:23,932
<font color=#ffff00>Who wondered it would matter
if I skimmed some of the top?</font>

1034
01:05:24,232 --> 01:05:26,898
<font color=#ffff00>But let me ask you a question.</font>

1035
01:05:27,261 --> 01:05:30,704
<font color=#ffff00>Why would I slaughter my cash cow?</font>

1036
01:05:30,975 --> 01:05:31,987
<font color=#ffff00>I didn't do it.</font>

1037
01:05:32,307 --> 01:05:33,613
<font color=#ffff00>- I didn't kill him!
- He didn't.</font>

1038
01:05:34,610 --> 01:05:35,753
<font color=#ffff00>He didn't.</font>

1039
01:05:36,654 --> 01:05:39,423
<font color=#ffff00>I expect his alibi revolves around me
drinking till the early hours</font>

1040
01:05:39,645 --> 01:05:40,645
<font color=#ffff00>Well, it's true.</font>

1041
01:05:40,755 --> 01:05:44,205
<font color=#ffff00>I saw him having whiskey and remarked
in the lesser quality of American liquor.</font>

1042
01:05:44,422 --> 01:05:46,829
<font color=#ffff00>He offered me a tipple to
change my mind and another.</font>

1043
01:05:47,635 --> 01:05:50,182
<font color=#ffff00>We got to arguing politics.
He had some...</font>

1044
01:05:50,983 --> 01:05:54,250
<font color=#ffff00>tom-fool opinions on Stalin I had to
correct, but the man knows his spirits.</font>

1045
01:05:58,279 --> 01:06:00,093
<font color=#ffff00>A word, please, monsieur.</font>

1046
01:06:00,284 --> 01:06:02,124
<font color=#ffff00>You can't confirm you
were with him all night?</font>

1047
01:06:02,277 --> 01:06:04,170
<font color=#ffff00>We smoked and spoke
till nearly 2, yes.</font>

1048
01:06:04,424 --> 01:06:06,250
<font color=#ffff00>Ah such charms, him with
his cigarettes and you...</font>

1049
01:06:06,274 --> 01:06:08,634
<font color=#ffff00>Ah yes, you are the only man on
the train who smokes a pipe.</font>

1050
01:06:08,690 --> 01:06:10,546
<font color=#ffff00>May I see your pipe and
your tobacco, please?</font>

1051
01:06:10,718 --> 01:06:11,718
<font color=#ffff00>Of course.</font>

1052
01:06:11,842 --> 01:06:15,357
<font color=#ffff00>And you, Dr Arbuthnot, was traveling
from India, I believe. Yes?</font>

1053
01:06:15,603 --> 01:06:17,198
<font color=#ffff00>You are interviewing me now?</font>

1054
01:06:17,478 --> 01:06:19,410
<font color=#ffff00>Were you ever in Rachett's
compartment before he was killed?</font>

1055
01:06:19,434 --> 01:06:20,320
<font color=#ffff00>Certainly not.</font>

1056
01:06:20,402 --> 01:06:22,442
<font color=#ffff00>But this is one of your pipe
cleaners, n'est-Ce pas?</font>

1057
01:06:22,512 --> 01:06:25,938
<font color=#ffff00>If you found that in the dead
man's cabin, look elsewhere.</font>

1058
01:06:26,144 --> 01:06:28,638
<font color=#ffff00>I am a doctor, sir.
I heal people, I do not hurt them.</font>

1059
01:06:28,850 --> 01:06:31,793
<font color=#ffff00>About this, you must have
worked very hard to become a doctor.</font>

1060
01:06:31,988 --> 01:06:35,172
<font color=#ffff00>Not many of your race are
allowed the opportunity.</font>

1061
01:06:36,338 --> 01:06:38,298
<font color=#ffff00>Middlesex Medical college,
permits one per class.</font>

1062
01:06:38,385 --> 01:06:40,232
<font color=#ffff00>I had the honor in '24.</font>

1063
01:06:41,660 --> 01:06:43,904
<font color=#ffff00>I was a sniper in my tour.</font>

1064
01:06:44,210 --> 01:06:45,585
<font color=#ffff00>Sharp shooter.</font>

1065
01:06:45,930 --> 01:06:47,290
<font color=#ffff00>Saved more than a few officers.</font>

1066
01:06:47,471 --> 01:06:49,831
<font color=#ffff00>More grateful recognized
a fair mind with a steady hand..</font>

1067
01:06:49,954 --> 01:06:51,665
<font color=#ffff00>They supported my education.</font>

1068
01:06:51,932 --> 01:06:53,332
<font color=#ffff00>I took their generosity as a debt.</font>

1069
01:06:53,393 --> 01:06:55,318
<font color=#ffff00>Did you know of Colonel Armstrong?</font>

1070
01:06:55,634 --> 01:06:58,259
<font color=#ffff00>Might have know two or three Armstrong.</font>

1071
01:06:58,533 --> 01:06:59,533
<font color=#ffff00>Tommy in the sixties...</font>

1072
01:06:59,714 --> 01:07:01,775
<font color=#ffff00>- Selby Armstrong...
- No I meant, Colonel John Armstrong.</font>

1073
01:07:01,799 --> 01:07:06,044
<font color=#ffff00>He had an American wife and his
child was kidnapped and murdered.</font>

1074
01:07:08,200 --> 01:07:09,200
<font color=#ffff00>Never came across them.</font>

1075
01:07:09,393 --> 01:07:11,278
<font color=#ffff00>When did you first meet Miss Debenham?</font>

1076
01:07:11,517 --> 01:07:14,407
<font color=#ffff00>We met when we shared the railway
convoy cart from Kirkuk to Nissibin.</font>

1077
01:07:14,674 --> 01:07:17,741
<font color=#ffff00>She claims otherwise, and she has
made herself problematically suspicious.</font>

1078
01:07:19,058 --> 01:07:20,636
<font color=#ffff00>Mary is a lady.</font>

1079
01:07:22,418 --> 01:07:24,138
<font color=#ffff00>Leave her out of this.
I can vouch for her.</font>

1080
01:07:24,168 --> 01:07:25,921
<font color=#ffff00>As you have vouched for McQueen's time?</font>

1081
01:07:29,409 --> 01:07:30,929
<font color=#ffff00>- You won't listen to reasons.
- Never.</font>

1082
01:07:32,594 --> 01:07:35,921
<font color=#ffff00>You are lucky. The good doctor insisted
he did not let you out of his sight.</font>

1083
01:07:36,273 --> 01:07:37,753
<font color=#ffff00>See? There. I could
not have done it.</font>

1084
01:07:37,922 --> 01:07:38,922
<font color=#ffff00>Yes, you could.</font>

1085
01:07:39,121 --> 01:07:40,881
<font color=#ffff00>Rachette took a sleeping
draft each evening.</font>

1086
01:07:41,042 --> 01:07:43,669
<font color=#ffff00>You could add Barbital,
easily access that drug.</font>

1087
01:07:43,877 --> 01:07:45,837
<font color=#ffff00>Do the same with one of the
doctor's many drinks..</font>

1088
01:07:45,861 --> 01:07:47,301
<font color=#ffff00>And the chance to kill him is clear.</font>

1089
01:07:47,378 --> 01:07:48,444
<font color=#ffff00>Why would I do any of that?</font>

1090
01:07:48,468 --> 01:07:49,624
<font color=#ffff00>We've established your motive.</font>

1091
01:07:49,648 --> 01:07:51,495
<font color=#ffff00>Perhaps I would suggest a different one.</font>

1092
01:07:51,698 --> 01:07:55,970
<font color=#ffff00>A different reason,
a more personal reason.</font>

1093
01:07:56,121 --> 01:07:58,792
<font color=#ffff00><i>"A lawyer by education,
not by disposition".</i></font>

1094
01:07:59,013 --> 01:08:01,807
<font color=#ffff00>Why did you pursue the law I wonder?</font>

1095
01:08:03,045 --> 01:08:08,585
<font color=#ffff00>Was it to appease a much loved
but demanding father?</font>

1096
01:08:09,626 --> 01:08:14,976
<font color=#ffff00>One who himself have made a great
success in the same field...</font>

1097
01:08:15,154 --> 01:08:18,993
<font color=#ffff00>and then lost his position?</font>

1098
01:08:20,064 --> 01:08:22,955
<font color=#ffff00>There was a renowned
McQueen, was that not?</font>

1099
01:08:23,191 --> 01:08:26,647
<font color=#ffff00>The District Attorney for
the State of New Jersey...</font>

1100
01:08:26,801 --> 01:08:31,758
<font color=#ffff00>responsible for the prosecution
of the Armstrong case.</font>

1101
01:08:34,637 --> 01:08:36,809
<font color=#ffff00>They didn't have a suspect.</font>

1102
01:08:37,909 --> 01:08:42,462
<font color=#ffff00>My dad was pressured to go after
this poor French woman...</font>

1103
01:08:42,727 --> 01:08:46,446
<font color=#ffff00>a maid with a weak
alibi, Susanne.</font>

1104
01:08:48,305 --> 01:08:50,258
<font color=#ffff00>He hung this whole case on her.</font>

1105
01:08:51,537 --> 01:08:54,251
<font color=#ffff00>She killed herself.</font>

1106
01:08:54,547 --> 01:08:56,945
<font color=#ffff00>She was an innocent.</font>

1107
01:08:57,265 --> 01:09:02,590
<font color=#ffff00>By the time the evidence led
to Cassetti, he was long gone.</font>

1108
01:09:03,883 --> 01:09:06,256
<font color=#ffff00>It tore my old man apart.</font>

1109
01:09:08,881 --> 01:09:10,716
<font color=#ffff00>I couldn't do anything for him.</font>

1110
01:09:10,952 --> 01:09:14,027
<font color=#ffff00>And yet you claim that you did not
know Ratchett was Cassetti.</font>

1111
01:09:14,266 --> 01:09:15,724
<font color=#ffff00>No. No.</font>

1112
01:09:16,009 --> 01:09:17,143
<font color=#ffff00>But you found him.</font>

1113
01:09:17,425 --> 01:09:18,358
<font color=#ffff00>No.</font>

1114
01:09:18,385 --> 01:09:20,177
<font color=#ffff00>- You found him. You bled him dry.
- No.</font>

1115
01:09:20,454 --> 01:09:24,681
<font color=#ffff00>In order to settle your father's debts
and then finally, to settle...</font>

1116
01:09:24,913 --> 01:09:26,119
<font color=#ffff00>No, no, no.</font>

1117
01:09:26,406 --> 01:09:28,144
<font color=#ffff00>No. It was not...</font>

1118
01:09:28,422 --> 01:09:31,105
<font color=#ffff00>It wasn't like that.
It was not...</font>

1119
01:09:34,420 --> 01:09:36,543
<font color=#ffff00>- Some one, kicking the door.
- Doctor!</font>

1120
01:09:36,817 --> 01:09:38,187
<font color=#ffff00>Covered my face!</font>

1121
01:09:39,997 --> 01:09:41,691
<font color=#ffff00>Alright, this needs to come out now.</font>

1122
01:09:47,419 --> 01:09:49,114
<font color=#ffff00>- I want my bag.
- Of course.</font>

1123
01:09:49,294 --> 01:09:50,364
<font color=#ffff00>It's in my compartment.</font>

1124
01:09:51,314 --> 01:09:52,556
<font color=#ffff00>There will be no fingerprints.</font>

1125
01:09:52,580 --> 01:09:54,528
<font color=#ffff00>The killer was disposing
of the murder weapon.</font>

1126
01:10:04,787 --> 01:10:07,056
<font color=#ffff00>The killer didn't hit her lung or artery.</font>

1127
01:10:07,344 --> 01:10:08,696
<font color=#ffff00>She's lucky to be alive.</font>

1128
01:10:08,880 --> 01:10:10,098
<font color=#ffff00>You all are.</font>

1129
01:10:10,363 --> 01:10:11,363
<font color=#ffff00>Yes, some genius!</font>

1130
01:10:11,472 --> 01:10:13,617
<font color=#ffff00>Why haven't you solved this case?</font>

1131
01:10:14,257 --> 01:10:16,071
<font color=#ffff00>You must give the man some time here.</font>

1132
01:10:16,073 --> 01:10:17,273
<font color=#ffff00>Yeah? Well...</font>

1133
01:10:17,521 --> 01:10:20,341
<font color=#ffff00>I can't give them much more.
I don't have any blood left.</font>

1134
01:10:20,533 --> 01:10:21,371
<font color=#ffff00>Yeah.</font>

1135
01:10:21,553 --> 01:10:24,310
<font color=#ffff00>Accosting Mr. McQueen and the
real killer is right here.</font>

1136
01:10:24,507 --> 01:10:26,128
<font color=#ffff00>One of you people.</font>

1137
01:10:28,451 --> 01:10:30,757
<font color=#ffff00>I don't know who you are.
I said nothing.</font>

1138
01:10:31,037 --> 01:10:32,277
<font color=#ffff00>Please, leave me alone.</font>

1139
01:10:32,549 --> 01:10:33,936
<font color=#ffff00>Say something.</font>

1140
01:10:34,108 --> 01:10:36,196
<font color=#ffff00>My friends, the tracks will be
cleared by the morning please.</font>

1141
01:10:36,220 --> 01:10:37,540
<font color=#ffff00>Please return to your rooms.</font>

1142
01:10:37,796 --> 01:10:38,796
<font color=#ffff00>I'm sleeping here..</font>

1143
01:10:39,012 --> 01:10:41,092
<font color=#ffff00>Where everyone can see me
and I can see everyone.</font>

1144
01:10:41,285 --> 01:10:42,956
<font color=#ffff00>You should all do the same.
Can't say of it..</font>

1145
01:10:42,980 --> 01:10:45,480
<font color=#ffff00>Remain in the open, safely in view,
until morning.</font>

1146
01:10:45,702 --> 01:10:47,582
<font color=#ffff00>The killer will never
hesitate to kill again.</font>

1147
01:10:51,652 --> 01:10:53,572
<font color=#ffff00>I will convey the same
message to the Andrenyi...</font>

1148
01:10:53,755 --> 01:10:55,155
<font color=#ffff00>diplomatic immunity or not.</font>

1149
01:10:59,878 --> 01:11:02,234
<font color=#ffff00>If you may, I will look
at your passports.</font>

1150
01:11:07,674 --> 01:11:09,074
<font color=#ffff00>You know that I must talk with her.</font>

1151
01:11:09,773 --> 01:11:11,561
<font color=#ffff00>By the way there is a grease
spot on your wife's name.</font>

1152
01:11:11,585 --> 01:11:12,648
<font color=#ffff00>You might want to look at that.</font>

1153
01:11:12,672 --> 01:11:14,115
<font color=#ffff00>Elena is not well.</font>

1154
01:11:15,147 --> 01:11:17,803
<font color=#ffff00>If you do not permit me, your reluctance
will be noted to the Yugoslav police...</font>

1155
01:11:17,827 --> 01:11:19,181
<font color=#ffff00>and I have no doubt that they
will arrest both of you...</font>

1156
01:11:19,205 --> 01:11:20,906
<font color=#ffff00>- How dare you?
- Honey!</font>

1157
01:11:29,904 --> 01:11:32,538
<font color=#ffff00>You are funny looking,
Monsieur Poirot.</font>

1158
01:11:32,816 --> 01:11:34,966
<font color=#ffff00>All detectives so funny looking?</font>

1159
01:11:37,626 --> 01:11:40,722
<font color=#ffff00>I am sorry to wake you,
Madame la Comtesse.</font>

1160
01:11:42,330 --> 01:11:44,146
<font color=#ffff00>I'm always awake at night.</font>

1161
01:11:44,357 --> 01:11:46,089
<font color=#ffff00>In the day I sleep.</font>

1162
01:11:46,321 --> 01:11:50,246
<font color=#ffff00>Some fear darkness, but I
cannot stand the light.</font>

1163
01:11:50,480 --> 01:11:52,240
<font color=#ffff00>You are always under
the influence of...</font>

1164
01:11:53,136 --> 01:11:54,136
<font color=#ffff00>Barbital.</font>

1165
01:11:54,768 --> 01:11:56,059
<font color=#ffff00>Barbital, Barbital.</font>

1166
01:11:56,991 --> 01:11:58,734
<font color=#ffff00>I take oceans of it.</font>

1167
01:12:01,530 --> 01:12:03,408
<font color=#ffff00>Oh, there is no use in lie, love.</font>

1168
01:12:03,653 --> 01:12:05,551
<font color=#ffff00>He can see right through us.</font>

1169
01:12:07,493 --> 01:12:09,662
<font color=#ffff00>I can not go outside without it.</font>

1170
01:12:10,863 --> 01:12:12,890
<font color=#ffff00>I can not sleep without it.</font>

1171
01:12:14,758 --> 01:12:16,488
<font color=#ffff00>I take it against my fears.</font>

1172
01:12:22,053 --> 01:12:23,053
<font color=#ffff00>What are you afraid of?</font>

1173
01:12:26,467 --> 01:12:27,580
<font color=#ffff00>Everything.</font>

1174
01:12:32,184 --> 01:12:36,570
<font color=#ffff00>Your passport has your maiden
name, as Goldenberg.</font>

1175
01:12:36,783 --> 01:12:37,972
<font color=#ffff00>Jewish, yes?</font>

1176
01:12:38,231 --> 01:12:40,559
<font color=#ffff00>Not so Jewish.
My middle name isn't Maria.</font>

1177
01:12:40,847 --> 01:12:42,421
<font color=#ffff00>And you are a dancer like your husband?</font>

1178
01:12:42,671 --> 01:12:44,361
<font color=#ffff00>No, not like my husband.</font>

1179
01:12:44,624 --> 01:12:46,524
<font color=#ffff00>Code ballet.</font>

1180
01:12:46,725 --> 01:12:47,885
<font color=#ffff00>He is touched by angels.</font>

1181
01:12:47,973 --> 01:12:51,696
<font color=#ffff00>I rely by passion and
hard work to become adequate.</font>

1182
01:12:54,768 --> 01:12:56,680
<font color=#ffff00>Excuse me.
I must lie down again.</font>

1183
01:12:57,224 --> 01:12:59,573
<font color=#ffff00>Is this your only dressing gown?</font>

1184
01:13:04,377 --> 01:13:08,045
<font color=#ffff00>No, I have another.
Golden-colored chiffon.</font>

1185
01:13:09,491 --> 01:13:10,731
<font color=#ffff00>I like speaking to detectives.</font>

1186
01:13:11,041 --> 01:13:13,107
<font color=#ffff00>You never know what
they will ask you next.</font>

1187
01:13:14,063 --> 01:13:15,233
<font color=#ffff00>I am particularly good at capitals.</font>

1188
01:13:15,257 --> 01:13:17,177
<font color=#ffff00>My governess was in a
strict love with Geography.</font>

1189
01:13:19,965 --> 01:13:21,589
<font color=#ffff00>He is satisfied?</font>

1190
01:13:21,851 --> 01:13:25,592
<font color=#ffff00>I am always satisfied
when I uncover a liar.</font>

1191
01:13:25,946 --> 01:13:29,377
<font color=#ffff00>Madame, your name is not
Elena, it is Helena.</font>

1192
01:13:29,551 --> 01:13:32,698
<font color=#ffff00>Despite your clumsy attempt to
change it here and in your luggage.</font>

1193
01:13:34,511 --> 01:13:36,996
<font color=#ffff00>My husband heard of a
piece of evidence found...</font>

1194
01:13:37,302 --> 01:13:41,128
<font color=#ffff00>a handkerchief embroider with an
"H", and I didn't want my "H" involved.</font>

1195
01:13:41,337 --> 01:13:44,483
<font color=#ffff00>So we changed it.
The luggage and the passport.</font>

1196
01:13:44,751 --> 01:13:46,828
<font color=#ffff00>It's no crime to want
to be distant from trouble.</font>

1197
01:13:47,184 --> 01:13:48,698
<font color=#ffff00>Yet here is trouble.</font>

1198
01:13:48,994 --> 01:13:52,639
<font color=#ffff00>A curious detail about the Armstrong
tragedy at the heart of this case...</font>

1199
01:13:52,890 --> 01:13:56,195
<font color=#ffff00>how many people
were wounded by it.</font>

1200
01:13:56,410 --> 01:13:58,102
<font color=#ffff00>The younger sister.</font>

1201
01:13:58,319 --> 01:14:00,019
<font color=#ffff00>The actress mother...</font>

1202
01:14:00,239 --> 01:14:03,259
<font color=#ffff00>stage name Linda Arden.</font>

1203
01:14:03,283 --> 01:14:06,987
<font color=#ffff00>I suppose she too was
of Jewish ancestry...</font>

1204
01:14:07,647 --> 01:14:10,543
<font color=#ffff00>as who is most likely
to take a stage name?</font>

1205
01:14:10,705 --> 01:14:13,487
<font color=#ffff00>Is is too far to suggest?</font>

1206
01:14:13,721 --> 01:14:16,590
<font color=#ffff00>Her original name was Goldenberg?</font>

1207
01:14:17,786 --> 01:14:22,115
<font color=#ffff00>Especially when we find a young
woman of the same age...</font>

1208
01:14:22,276 --> 01:14:24,885
<font color=#ffff00>As her surviving daughter...</font>

1209
01:14:25,103 --> 01:14:27,269
<font color=#ffff00>living in a world of fear.</font>

1210
01:14:27,929 --> 01:14:30,869
<font color=#ffff00>The sister of Sonia Armstrong.</font>

1211
01:14:32,662 --> 01:14:33,775
<font color=#ffff00>Get out!</font>

1212
01:14:38,205 --> 01:14:41,453
<font color=#ffff00>I hear noises and I run.
Just in time, yes?</font>

1213
01:14:41,703 --> 01:14:44,461
<font color=#ffff00>You must now believe the count
and the countess are the killers.</font>

1214
01:14:44,654 --> 01:14:47,351
<font color=#ffff00>The count is protective. The countess is
not someone to kill a bedroom spider.</font>

1215
01:14:47,375 --> 01:14:49,391
<font color=#ffff00>And you may desist with this</font>

1216
01:14:51,247 --> 01:14:54,389
<font color=#ffff00>You are never an Austrian,
nor a German nor a professor.</font>

1217
01:14:55,051 --> 01:14:58,812
<font color=#ffff00>But a good imitation.
Was it based on someone you know?</font>

1218
01:15:04,079 --> 01:15:07,747
<font color=#ffff00>I'll look a butcher when
I grew up as a Kraut.</font>

1219
01:15:08,011 --> 01:15:10,668
<font color=#ffff00>A good man, great accent.</font>

1220
01:15:14,199 --> 01:15:15,288
<font color=#ffff00>What was it?</font>

1221
01:15:15,567 --> 01:15:17,167
<font color=#ffff00>Said "Tu-ri≠n"...</font>

1222
01:15:17,399 --> 01:15:20,714
<font color=#ffff00>The emphasis on the wrong syllable
for a proud and proper Teuton.</font>

1223
01:15:21,413 --> 01:15:22,890
<font color=#ffff00>"Turin".</font>

1224
01:15:26,041 --> 01:15:30,095
<font color=#ffff00>You... Are a sharp knife,
I give you that.</font>

1225
01:15:34,659 --> 01:15:38,019
<font color=#ffff00>Herr Professor Gerhard Hardman...</font>

1226
01:15:38,307 --> 01:15:40,011
<font color=#ffff00>It's my cover.</font>

1227
01:15:40,270 --> 01:15:42,510
<font color=#ffff00>I am sorry about the colored folks cracks.</font>

1228
01:15:42,766 --> 01:15:45,605
<font color=#ffff00>Oh, I'm half a hid myself.</font>

1229
01:15:45,838 --> 01:15:48,612
<font color=#ffff00>Cyrus Bethman Hardman.</font>

1230
01:15:50,404 --> 01:15:51,804
<font color=#ffff00>You are a Pinkerton detective?</font>

1231
01:15:51,895 --> 01:15:53,730
<font color=#ffff00>Thirty years.</font>

1232
01:15:53,803 --> 01:15:56,697
<font color=#ffff00>I was in Istanbul, coming back
from my job when the office cabled.</font>

1233
01:15:56,882 --> 01:16:00,634
<font color=#ffff00>Ratchett asked for a man to tail
him, offering triple time.</font>

1234
01:16:00,836 --> 01:16:02,691
<font color=#ffff00>Like maybe nearby.</font>

1235
01:16:08,110 --> 01:16:12,643
<font color=#ffff00>He told me to look out for a
small dark man with a high voice.</font>

1236
01:16:13,358 --> 01:16:14,766
<font color=#ffff00>I watched that hall...</font>

1237
01:16:15,005 --> 01:16:17,672
<font color=#ffff00>all night through a
crack in my door.</font>

1238
01:16:17,907 --> 01:16:18,907
<font color=#ffff00>Any thug...</font>

1239
01:16:19,024 --> 01:16:21,294
<font color=#ffff00>Had to go by me first.</font>

1240
01:16:22,734 --> 01:16:23,888
<font color=#ffff00>I will take my oath on it.</font>

1241
01:16:24,092 --> 01:16:28,984
<font color=#ffff00>And would you also take your oath on
your 30 years as a Pikerton detective?</font>

1242
01:16:29,184 --> 01:16:30,518
<font color=#ffff00>Or would you lie to me again...</font>

1243
01:16:30,692 --> 01:16:33,922
<font color=#ffff00>and deny that you were, in
fact, a police man first?</font>

1244
01:16:34,179 --> 01:16:37,269
<font color=#ffff00>Your gun, the chequered grip,
the blue finish...</font>

1245
01:16:37,614 --> 01:16:40,488
<font color=#ffff00>produced for the
Police Positive edition.</font>

1246
01:16:40,741 --> 01:16:43,150
<font color=#ffff00>1927 issued.</font>

1247
01:16:43,427 --> 01:16:46,519
<font color=#ffff00>It appears there are no end
to the lies manufactured just for me.</font>

1248
01:16:48,291 --> 01:16:50,837
<font color=#ffff00>You can leave your gun
as you go professor.</font>

1249
01:17:10,275 --> 01:17:12,746
<font color=#ffff00>From the position of his cabin,</font>

1250
01:17:14,660 --> 01:17:17,643
<font color=#ffff00>it would have been impossible to miss.</font>

1251
01:17:19,758 --> 01:17:23,294
<font color=#ffff00>Unless Ratchett's
door was open...</font>

1252
01:17:23,483 --> 01:17:27,237
<font color=#ffff00>as Pilar Estravados
claims she opened it.</font>

1253
01:17:27,398 --> 01:17:30,435
<font color=#ffff00>In which case, someone
could have been...</font>

1254
01:17:30,749 --> 01:17:32,982
<font color=#ffff00>masked from his view.</font>

1255
01:17:38,733 --> 01:17:40,052
<font color=#ffff00>My dear Katherine.</font>

1256
01:17:41,452 --> 01:17:44,131
<font color=#ffff00>This is an abominable crime.</font>

1257
01:17:44,366 --> 01:17:47,462
<font color=#ffff00>And I'm struck, my Katherine.</font>

1258
01:17:50,344 --> 01:17:52,679
<font color=#ffff00>I can not find the crack in the wall.</font>

1259
01:17:53,902 --> 01:17:56,850
<font color=#ffff00>Why does one of them elude me?</font>

1260
01:18:01,584 --> 01:18:03,267
<font color=#ffff00>I have always been...</font>

1261
01:18:04,307 --> 01:18:05,684
<font color=#ffff00>So sure.</font>

1262
01:18:07,116 --> 01:18:08,738
<font color=#ffff00>Too sure.</font>

1263
01:18:10,871 --> 01:18:14,875
<font color=#ffff00>But now I am very humble.
And I will say, like a little child...</font>

1264
01:18:17,374 --> 01:18:19,066
<font color=#ffff00>"I do not know".</font>

1265
01:18:22,251 --> 01:18:24,566
<font color=#ffff00>I'm very afraid, my Katherine.</font>

1266
01:18:39,682 --> 01:18:41,082
<font color=#ffff00><i>My apologies,
ladies and gentlemen.</i></font>

1267
01:18:41,176 --> 01:18:43,821
<font color=#ffff00><i>It is not safe on board while the
engine is put back on the track.</i></font>

1268
01:18:44,133 --> 01:18:45,653
<font color=#ffff00>We have to wait in
the tunnel. Thank you.</font>

1269
01:18:45,677 --> 01:18:46,957
<font color=#ffff00>Where are they taking the dogs?</font>

1270
01:18:47,011 --> 01:18:48,074
<font color=#ffff00>They will be happy.</font>

1271
01:18:48,274 --> 01:18:50,555
<font color=#ffff00>- That's not right.
- Just to stretch the legs, it's good.</font>

1272
01:18:50,965 --> 01:18:52,535
<font color=#ffff00>No, it's not alright.</font>

1273
01:18:55,822 --> 01:18:57,445
<font color=#ffff00><i>Are we stuck?</i></font>

1274
01:18:57,805 --> 01:18:59,745
<font color=#ffff00>You asked for me?</font>

1275
01:18:59,937 --> 01:19:00,937
<font color=#ffff00>Another interrogation?</font>

1276
01:19:01,260 --> 01:19:03,491
<font color=#ffff00>Oh, no. I enjoy your company.</font>

1277
01:19:05,133 --> 01:19:06,168
<font color=#ffff00>Ah... Please.</font>

1278
01:19:07,799 --> 01:19:10,239
<font color=#ffff00>I have a list of ten questions I
am not nearer to answering...</font>

1279
01:19:10,399 --> 01:19:12,290
<font color=#ffff00>and the train is about to leave.</font>

1280
01:19:12,403 --> 01:19:14,457
<font color=#ffff00>You have a clear mind...</font>

1281
01:19:14,687 --> 01:19:18,324
<font color=#ffff00>and I thought you might
produce an insight.</font>

1282
01:19:22,662 --> 01:19:25,474
<font color=#ffff00><i>"The handkerchief."</i></font>

1283
01:19:25,775 --> 01:19:29,249
<font color=#ffff00><i>"The scarlet kimono. The uniform."</i></font>

1284
01:19:29,464 --> 01:19:31,560
<font color=#ffff00><i>"The time on the watch."</i></font>

1285
01:19:31,717 --> 01:19:35,351
<font color=#ffff00><i>"Was he murdered then?
Earlier or later?"</i></font>

1286
01:19:35,565 --> 01:19:37,781
<font color=#ffff00><i>"By one person or more?"</i></font>

1287
01:19:38,061 --> 01:19:39,636
<font color=#ffff00><i>"Which of them?"</i></font>

1288
01:19:42,627 --> 01:19:44,209
<font color=#ffff00>Sorry, I can't help you.</font>

1289
01:19:48,460 --> 01:19:51,049
<font color=#ffff00>Perhaps there's an eleventh
question you don't know to ask yet...</font>

1290
01:19:51,220 --> 01:19:53,232
<font color=#ffff00>that will give you the answer to the rest.</font>

1291
01:19:53,517 --> 01:19:54,687
<font color=#ffff00>Perhaps.</font>

1292
01:19:55,917 --> 01:19:59,507
<font color=#ffff00>I could point and easy finger
at the Countess Andrenyi,</font>

1293
01:19:59,776 --> 01:20:01,965
<font color=#ffff00>I discovered she was Sonia
Armstrong's sister.</font>

1294
01:20:02,254 --> 01:20:03,597
<font color=#ffff00>- Are you certain?
- Yes</font>

1295
01:20:03,752 --> 01:20:05,352
<font color=#ffff00>I suspect she may perhaps be innocent.</font>

1296
01:20:05,524 --> 01:20:06,710
<font color=#ffff00>Perhaps.</font>

1297
01:20:07,006 --> 01:20:09,621
<font color=#ffff00>But so many people have lied to me
on this train, I do not seem to mind.</font>

1298
01:20:09,645 --> 01:20:11,925
<font color=#ffff00>- You yourself did so effortlessly.
- Me?</font>

1299
01:20:12,187 --> 01:20:13,867
<font color=#ffff00>You told me you've
never been to America.</font>

1300
01:20:13,965 --> 01:20:16,372
<font color=#ffff00>You also concealed the fact that at
the time of the tragedy...</font>

1301
01:20:16,396 --> 01:20:18,356
<font color=#ffff00>you were living in the
Armstrong Household...</font>

1302
01:20:18,476 --> 01:20:20,890
<font color=#ffff00>as governess to their daughter.
And you know this.</font>

1303
01:20:21,164 --> 01:20:22,757
<font color=#ffff00>I have my living to get.</font>

1304
01:20:23,085 --> 01:20:24,987
<font color=#ffff00>A girl detained in connection
to a murder case...</font>

1305
01:20:25,011 --> 01:20:26,571
<font color=#ffff00>No decent family would engage me.</font>

1306
01:20:26,722 --> 01:20:29,271
<font color=#ffff00>Miss Debenham, you planned
Rachette's murder.</font>

1307
01:20:29,501 --> 01:20:31,461
<font color=#ffff00>And then you sent for the
Countess to witness it.</font>

1308
01:20:31,652 --> 01:20:34,519
<font color=#ffff00>If she saw him dead, the Helena
you knew might return.</font>

1309
01:20:34,722 --> 01:20:36,922
<font color=#ffff00>You waited for your room mate to
sleep, and she did not.</font>

1310
01:20:36,946 --> 01:20:39,266
<font color=#ffff00>You drugged her.
But the Barbital only gave her a headache.</font>

1311
01:20:39,330 --> 01:20:40,383
<font color=#ffff00>She begged for an aspirin!</font>

1312
01:20:40,609 --> 01:20:42,179
<font color=#ffff00>When the train stopped,
When the conductor was on the station...</font>

1313
01:20:42,203 --> 01:20:43,273
<font color=#ffff00>when the coach was clear at last,</font>

1314
01:20:43,297 --> 01:20:45,684
<font color=#ffff00>when you were allowed to enter
Rachette's compartment, unseen!</font>

1315
01:20:45,708 --> 01:20:47,649
<font color=#ffff00>You loved Daisy Armstrong.
You killed Cassetti!</font>

1316
01:20:51,692 --> 01:20:53,186
<font color=#ffff00>Cassetti was a pig.</font>

1317
01:20:53,374 --> 01:20:54,975
<font color=#ffff00>He deserved to die.</font>

1318
01:21:03,405 --> 01:21:04,923
<font color=#ffff00>She didn't kill him.</font>

1319
01:21:07,164 --> 01:21:08,610
<font color=#ffff00>I did.</font>

1320
01:21:13,239 --> 01:21:14,472
<font color=#ffff00>Mary, go.</font>

1321
01:21:15,495 --> 01:21:16,934
<font color=#ffff00>I can't let you take the blame...</font>

1322
01:21:16,981 --> 01:21:18,541
<font color=#ffff00>for what I did alone.</font>

1323
01:21:23,866 --> 01:21:25,413
<font color=#ffff00>Mary, please go.</font>

1324
01:21:28,941 --> 01:21:32,072
<font color=#ffff00>John Armstrong was my best
friend, my commander.</font>

1325
01:21:33,919 --> 01:21:35,564
<font color=#ffff00>He believed in me.</font>

1326
01:21:36,375 --> 01:21:39,553
<font color=#ffff00>He sent me to medical
school, gave me a future.</font>

1327
01:21:40,801 --> 01:21:42,993
<font color=#ffff00>Cassetti destroyed it.</font>

1328
01:21:45,121 --> 01:21:47,043
<font color=#ffff00>In grief, I found Mary.</font>

1329
01:21:48,812 --> 01:21:50,657
<font color=#ffff00>And I found Ratchett.</font>

1330
01:21:52,426 --> 01:21:56,461
<font color=#ffff00>Our plan was to avail him to
the police, that's what you heard.</font>

1331
01:21:57,505 --> 01:21:59,803
<font color=#ffff00>But when I saw his face...</font>

1332
01:22:01,811 --> 01:22:03,862
<font color=#ffff00>I knew he didn't deserve a trial.</font>

1333
01:22:04,460 --> 01:22:07,490
<font color=#ffff00>So, you drugged McQueen.</font>

1334
01:22:07,695 --> 01:22:09,627
<font color=#ffff00>You changed the time on the watch...</font>

1335
01:22:09,863 --> 01:22:12,578
<font color=#ffff00>so that you could lie about
the time of death.</font>

1336
01:22:12,819 --> 01:22:15,055
<font color=#ffff00>I couldn't let Mary be accused.</font>

1337
01:22:15,329 --> 01:22:16,424
<font color=#ffff00>Or McQueen.</font>

1338
01:22:18,008 --> 01:22:21,221
<font color=#ffff00>My sins are mine to pay for alone.</font>

1339
01:22:21,932 --> 01:22:23,394
<font color=#ffff00>I am a soldier.</font>

1340
01:22:23,572 --> 01:22:25,005
<font color=#ffff00>A soldier kills to protect.</font>

1341
01:22:26,069 --> 01:22:28,795
<font color=#ffff00>And now, Mr. Poirot, I must
protect myself from you.</font>

1342
01:22:38,924 --> 01:22:41,579
<font color=#ffff00>Why aren't you dead yet?</font>

1343
01:22:46,700 --> 01:22:48,123
<font color=#ffff00>Poirot?</font>

1344
01:23:01,987 --> 01:23:03,659
<font color=#ffff00><i>Gentlemen, stop!</i></font>

1345
01:23:04,612 --> 01:23:07,490
<font color=#ffff00>Sir, you need to get all
the passengers back on the train.</font>

1346
01:23:08,781 --> 01:23:10,817
<font color=#ffff00>You will retire...</font>

1347
01:23:10,980 --> 01:23:12,827
<font color=#ffff00>away from the train...</font>

1348
01:23:14,460 --> 01:23:17,112
<font color=#ffff00>until I tell you to return.</font>

1349
01:23:34,652 --> 01:23:36,271
<font color=#ffff00>You tell your lies.</font>

1350
01:23:37,040 --> 01:23:39,200
<font color=#ffff00>Then you think no one will know.</font>

1351
01:23:39,969 --> 01:23:42,298
<font color=#ffff00>But there are two people who will know.</font>

1352
01:23:42,891 --> 01:23:44,506
<font color=#ffff00>Yes, two people.</font>

1353
01:23:45,391 --> 01:23:46,945
<font color=#ffff00>Your God...</font>

1354
01:23:48,043 --> 01:23:50,192
<font color=#ffff00>and the Hercule Poirot.</font>

1355
01:23:53,962 --> 01:23:56,918
<font color=#ffff00>It is time to solve this case.</font>

1356
01:24:17,238 --> 01:24:20,792
<font color=#ffff00>Dr. Arbuthnot asked me
why I was not yet dead.</font>

1357
01:24:22,048 --> 01:24:24,171
<font color=#ffff00>He knew of course the answer.</font>

1358
01:24:24,789 --> 01:24:27,381
<font color=#ffff00>A sharpshooter who does not
kill at close range.</font>

1359
01:24:29,088 --> 01:24:32,134
<font color=#ffff00>Your shot was not a mistake,
it was a surgery.</font>

1360
01:24:32,746 --> 01:24:35,436
<font color=#ffff00>You couldn't kill me because
you are not a killer.</font>

1361
01:24:36,811 --> 01:24:38,870
<font color=#ffff00>None of you are killers.</font>

1362
01:24:39,839 --> 01:24:42,191
<font color=#ffff00>And, yet, someone must be.</font>

1363
01:24:45,039 --> 01:24:47,313
<font color=#ffff00>There are two possible
solutions to this crime.</font>

1364
01:24:48,811 --> 01:24:51,597
<font color=#ffff00>One difficult, because it fits
with most, but not all of the facts...</font>

1365
01:24:51,793 --> 01:24:53,122
<font color=#ffff00>and one more...</font>

1366
01:24:53,417 --> 01:24:54,986
<font color=#ffff00>complex.</font>

1367
01:24:55,894 --> 01:24:57,928
<font color=#ffff00>The first solution.</font>

1368
01:24:58,049 --> 01:24:59,595
<font color=#ffff00>Ratchett had enemies.</font>

1369
01:24:59,846 --> 01:25:02,861
<font color=#ffff00>A rouge mafia gets onto
the train at Vinkovci...</font>

1370
01:25:02,961 --> 01:25:04,975
<font color=#ffff00>as McQueen and Arbuthnot take the air.</font>

1371
01:25:05,177 --> 01:25:07,933
<font color=#ffff00>Equipped with a uniform and an
pass key, he stabs Ratchett.</font>

1372
01:25:08,207 --> 01:25:11,179
<font color=#ffff00>He leaves through Ms Hubbard's
compartment and makes his escape.</font>

1373
01:25:11,525 --> 01:25:12,525
<font color=#ffff00>No.</font>

1374
01:25:13,199 --> 01:25:15,800
<font color=#ffff00>No, no, no. It doesn't work.</font>

1375
01:25:16,570 --> 01:25:18,379
<font color=#ffff00>Why hide the uniform?</font>

1376
01:25:18,894 --> 01:25:20,335
<font color=#ffff00>Who drugged Ratchett?</font>

1377
01:25:20,611 --> 01:25:22,531
<font color=#ffff00>Who stabbed Mrs. Hubbard?</font>

1378
01:25:22,969 --> 01:25:24,515
<font color=#ffff00>Damn it man!</font>

1379
01:25:25,678 --> 01:25:28,210
<font color=#ffff00>So I ask, who is next to benefit?</font>

1380
01:25:28,732 --> 01:25:32,299
<font color=#ffff00>This crime is murdering of a murderer.</font>

1381
01:25:32,854 --> 01:25:35,079
<font color=#ffff00>The benefit is, perhaps...</font>

1382
01:25:35,616 --> 01:25:38,745
<font color=#ffff00>to the spirit, an
ease of suffering.</font>

1383
01:25:39,910 --> 01:25:44,223
<font color=#ffff00>To quite a shouting voice in the
head that prevents sleep.</font>

1384
01:25:50,457 --> 01:25:52,702
<font color=#ffff00>There is a murderer among us.</font>

1385
01:25:54,135 --> 01:25:55,135
<font color=#ffff00>So...</font>

1386
01:25:56,444 --> 01:25:59,975
<font color=#ffff00>We have Dr. Arbuthnot, a dedicated
grateful friend to Colonel Armstrong.</font>

1387
01:26:01,326 --> 01:26:04,322
<font color=#ffff00>He meets and finds solace in the company
of the governess, Mary Debenham...</font>

1388
01:26:04,565 --> 01:26:07,051
<font color=#ffff00>who is almost like a
mother to the little girl.</font>

1389
01:26:07,320 --> 01:26:11,781
<font color=#ffff00>And so close to Mrs.
Armstrong's young sister...</font>

1390
01:26:12,043 --> 01:26:13,855
<font color=#ffff00>Helena Goldenberg.</font>

1391
01:26:14,058 --> 01:26:18,575
<font color=#ffff00>Married to a powerful man,
no stranger to rage and violence.</font>

1392
01:26:19,146 --> 01:26:22,719
<font color=#ffff00>We travel also with
Daisy's godmother...</font>

1393
01:26:22,909 --> 01:26:25,471
<font color=#ffff00>to whom belongs...</font>

1394
01:26:25,812 --> 01:26:30,703
<font color=#ffff00>the monogrammed handkerchief
found at the scene of the crime.</font>

1395
01:26:30,868 --> 01:26:36,273
<font color=#ffff00>The letter "H" in the Russian alphabet,
of course, pronounced "N".</font>

1396
01:26:37,174 --> 01:26:39,408
<font color=#ffff00>Natalia Dragomiroff.</font>

1397
01:26:39,551 --> 01:26:42,145
<font color=#ffff00>And her devoted maid with the chef's eye.</font>

1398
01:26:42,221 --> 01:26:45,909
<font color=#ffff00>Who was she before her current employ?
Might I suggest the Armstrong's cook?</font>

1399
01:26:46,890 --> 01:26:49,873
<font color=#ffff00>But we are not yet done.</font>

1400
01:26:50,292 --> 01:26:51,993
<font color=#ffff00>The nurse in charge of Daisy...</font>

1401
01:26:52,160 --> 01:26:55,281
<font color=#ffff00>her new found religious ill, born of
guilt of allowing her child...</font>

1402
01:26:55,517 --> 01:26:57,358
<font color=#ffff00>to be abducted. It was you...</font>

1403
01:26:57,400 --> 01:27:00,400
<font color=#ffff00><i>who was in her room the night when
Rachette came in through the window.</i></font>

1404
01:27:01,792 --> 01:27:04,392
<font color=#ffff00>Did you have a glass of wine
too many with your supper that night?</font>

1405
01:27:04,519 --> 01:27:06,018
<font color=#ffff00>Have you blamed
yourself ever since?</font>

1406
01:27:06,076 --> 01:27:07,796
<font color=#ffff00>For not being alert to stop him?</font>

1407
01:27:07,942 --> 01:27:10,574
<font color=#ffff00>She knew nothing but kindness...</font>

1408
01:27:10,771 --> 01:27:12,816
<font color=#ffff00>and love, until...</font>

1409
01:27:16,220 --> 01:27:17,403
<font color=#ffff00>until I...</font>

1410
01:27:18,979 --> 01:27:20,850
<font color=#ffff00>No need to divine with me, sir.</font>

1411
01:27:21,460 --> 01:27:24,787
<font color=#ffff00>I was Colonel Armstrong's
bat man in the war.</font>

1412
01:27:25,599 --> 01:27:28,640
<font color=#ffff00>And afterwards, his valet in New York.</font>

1413
01:27:29,926 --> 01:27:32,551
<font color=#ffff00>As fine a man has God ever made.</font>

1414
01:27:32,778 --> 01:27:34,566
<font color=#ffff00>Would his chauffeur agree?</font>

1415
01:27:34,890 --> 01:27:38,349
<font color=#ffff00>Was it a bank loan secured by Armstrong
allows him to build his automobile empire.</font>

1416
01:27:38,634 --> 01:27:41,064
<font color=#ffff00>He is in debt for life.
Who else can we count?</font>

1417
01:27:41,226 --> 01:27:43,853
<font color=#ffff00>What of the Pinkerton
detective, once a police officer?</font>

1418
01:27:44,138 --> 01:27:46,103
<font color=#ffff00>Assigned to the Armstrong case?</font>

1419
01:27:46,410 --> 01:27:51,388
<font color=#ffff00>And he becomes attached to some one for,
there is another uncelebrated victim.</font>

1420
01:27:51,590 --> 01:27:55,219
<font color=#ffff00>You fell in love with the maid
before she was falsely accused.</font>

1421
01:27:55,455 --> 01:27:56,945
<font color=#ffff00><i>You quit the police when
you witnessed the...</i></font>

1422
01:27:56,969 --> 01:27:58,981
<font color=#ffff00><i>the travesty of justice...</i></font>

1423
01:27:59,182 --> 01:28:01,911
<font color=#ffff00><i>when McQueen's father insisted
on her arrest...</i></font>

1424
01:28:02,154 --> 01:28:04,341
<font color=#ffff00>when she took her own life.</font>

1425
01:28:04,491 --> 01:28:06,434
<font color=#ffff00><i>No! No, no!</i></font>

1426
01:28:07,659 --> 01:28:10,407
<font color=#ffff00>Susanne was a so gentle.</font>

1427
01:28:10,772 --> 01:28:12,712
<font color=#ffff00>And she fell for me.</font>

1428
01:28:13,578 --> 01:28:17,301
<font color=#ffff00>Old and already getting Grey.
I told her she could do better...</font>

1429
01:28:19,474 --> 01:28:20,907
<font color=#ffff00>but there she was...</font>

1430
01:28:21,546 --> 01:28:24,662
<font color=#ffff00>on time for every date.</font>

1431
01:28:26,013 --> 01:28:27,031
<font color=#ffff00>Why else...</font>

1432
01:28:27,255 --> 01:28:30,246
<font color=#ffff00>is a train so full
in the dead of winter?</font>

1433
01:28:30,484 --> 01:28:33,396
<font color=#ffff00>Why the inconsistent **
Why the abundance of evidence. Why...?</font>

1434
01:28:35,028 --> 01:28:37,105
<font color=#ffff00>Why the conductor?</font>

1435
01:28:38,154 --> 01:28:40,494
<font color=#ffff00>Pierre Michel of Avignon...</font>

1436
01:28:41,634 --> 01:28:43,653
<font color=#ffff00>who lost his sister...</font>

1437
01:28:44,420 --> 01:28:46,332
<font color=#ffff00>the accused maid...</font>

1438
01:28:47,019 --> 01:28:49,129
<font color=#ffff00>Susanne Michele.</font>

1439
01:28:52,994 --> 01:28:57,745
<font color=#ffff00>Only one soul can claim to have
lost more than any of you.</font>

1440
01:28:58,057 --> 01:29:00,810
<font color=#ffff00>The tragic Linda Arden...</font>

1441
01:29:00,981 --> 01:29:02,999
<font color=#ffff00>Mother of Sonia...</font>

1442
01:29:03,180 --> 01:29:05,254
<font color=#ffff00>Grandmother of Daisy.</font>

1443
01:29:05,430 --> 01:29:07,363
<font color=#ffff00>Retired from the stage...</font>

1444
01:29:08,029 --> 01:29:11,318
<font color=#ffff00>but for one final performance.</font>

1445
01:29:31,661 --> 01:29:34,389
<font color=#ffff00>You are an awfully clever man.</font>

1446
01:29:37,129 --> 01:29:40,349
<font color=#ffff00>A murderer should have one victim.</font>

1447
01:29:40,606 --> 01:29:43,327
<font color=#ffff00>When Ratchett kills
Daisi Armstrong...</font>

1448
01:29:43,615 --> 01:29:48,425
<font color=#ffff00>A dozen lives are broken,
deformed, ended.</font>

1449
01:29:48,713 --> 01:29:51,113
<font color=#ffff00>They demand justice!</font>

1450
01:29:51,838 --> 01:29:55,107
<font color=#ffff00>Of all these wounded souls, we
must finally answer...</font>

1451
01:29:55,310 --> 01:29:58,088
<font color=#ffff00>Who among them is a killer?</font>

1452
01:29:58,317 --> 01:30:01,922
<font color=#ffff00>Who takes up the knife?
The answer is...</font>

1453
01:30:06,953 --> 01:30:10,038
<font color=#ffff00>Not single one of you could have done it.</font>

1454
01:30:10,550 --> 01:30:12,160
<font color=#ffff00>Nor any pair.</font>

1455
01:30:12,563 --> 01:30:14,963
<font color=#ffff00>It can only have been done...</font>

1456
01:30:15,569 --> 01:30:17,257
<font color=#ffff00>by all of you</font>

1457
01:30:18,154 --> 01:30:19,292
<font color=#ffff00><i>Together.</i></font>

1458
01:30:22,334 --> 01:30:23,590
<font color=#ffff00><i>Together.</i></font>

1459
01:30:25,032 --> 01:30:26,872
<font color=#ffff00><i>Even when the avalanche
changes everything...</i></font>

1460
01:30:27,155 --> 01:30:30,601
<font color=#ffff00><i>As does the detective,
plan was changed.</i></font>

1461
01:30:30,900 --> 01:30:33,214
<font color=#ffff00><i>The kimono, the uniform.</i></font>

1462
01:30:33,427 --> 01:30:36,688
<font color=#ffff00><i>A remarkable improvisation, the doctor
knows how to wound without killing.</i></font>

1463
01:30:36,905 --> 01:30:38,633
<font color=#ffff00><i>Each had their part to play.</i></font>

1464
01:30:38,932 --> 01:30:40,169
<font color=#ffff00><i>Do it!</i></font>

1465
01:30:40,691 --> 01:30:42,146
<font color=#ffff00><i>It was my plan.</i></font>

1466
01:30:43,433 --> 01:30:45,257
<font color=#ffff00>I recruited them.</font>

1467
01:30:45,971 --> 01:30:48,233
<font color=#ffff00>I had Hardman track down Cassetti.</font>

1468
01:30:48,456 --> 01:30:51,604
<font color=#ffff00>I sent McQueen to work for
him, and then Masterman.</font>

1469
01:30:53,106 --> 01:30:55,891
<font color=#ffff00>McQueen could arrange the travel
on the day that Michel was on duty.</font>

1470
01:32:33,716 --> 01:32:34,716
<font color=#ffff00><i>Mr. Ratchett?</i></font>

1471
01:32:39,422 --> 01:32:41,148
<font color=#ffff00><i>Goodnight.</i></font>

1472
01:32:42,728 --> 01:32:44,313
<font color=#ffff00><i>And so it is done.</i></font>

1473
01:32:45,228 --> 01:32:46,920
<font color=#ffff00><i>For the death of the innocent.</i></font>

1474
01:32:47,762 --> 01:32:50,468
<font color=#ffff00><i>A life... For a life.</i></font>

1475
01:32:52,600 --> 01:32:53,992
<font color=#ffff00>Revenge.</font>

1476
01:32:55,480 --> 01:32:57,365
<font color=#ffff00>No one should hang for this but me!</font>

1477
01:32:57,600 --> 01:32:59,872
<font color=#ffff00>It was my plan!</font>

1478
01:33:00,904 --> 01:33:03,803
<font color=#ffff00>Tell the police that it
was me alone.</font>

1479
01:33:04,104 --> 01:33:06,890
<font color=#ffff00>There is no life left in me anymore.</font>

1480
01:33:07,164 --> 01:33:09,982
<font color=#ffff00>They...
Have a chance now.</font>

1481
01:33:10,197 --> 01:33:11,432
<font color=#ffff00>Helena, I prey...</font>

1482
01:33:14,438 --> 01:33:16,101
<font color=#ffff00>Has a chance.</font>

1483
01:33:16,552 --> 01:33:17,852
<font color=#ffff00>They can...</font>

1484
01:33:19,188 --> 01:33:20,775
<font color=#ffff00>Go, live...</font>

1485
01:33:21,454 --> 01:33:23,211
<font color=#ffff00>Find some joy...</font>

1486
01:33:23,508 --> 01:33:24,874
<font color=#ffff00>Somewhere.</font>

1487
01:33:26,887 --> 01:33:29,087
<font color=#ffff00>Let it end with me.</font>

1488
01:33:32,343 --> 01:33:34,013
<font color=#ffff00>They are not killers.</font>

1489
01:33:35,709 --> 01:33:37,694
<font color=#ffff00>They are good people.</font>

1490
01:33:39,053 --> 01:33:41,243
<font color=#ffff00>They can be good again.</font>

1491
01:33:45,064 --> 01:33:48,261
<font color=#ffff00>There was right,
there was wrong.</font>

1492
01:33:48,820 --> 01:33:50,665
<font color=#ffff00>And now there is you.</font>

1493
01:33:54,493 --> 01:33:56,647
<font color=#ffff00>I can not judge this.</font>

1494
01:33:57,831 --> 01:33:59,512
<font color=#ffff00>You must decide.</font>

1495
01:34:01,116 --> 01:34:03,356
<font color=#ffff00>Do you wish to go free without
punishment for your crime?</font>

1496
01:34:05,327 --> 01:34:07,581
<font color=#ffff00>Then you must only commit one more.</font>

1497
01:34:09,256 --> 01:34:10,469
<font color=#ffff00>I'll not stop you.</font>

1498
01:34:13,778 --> 01:34:16,093
<font color=#ffff00>You can't let them kill you.</font>

1499
01:34:16,892 --> 01:34:21,712
<font color=#ffff00>You give my body to the lake, and
you will go away innocent at the station.</font>

1500
01:34:22,541 --> 01:34:24,153
<font color=#ffff00>You must silence me.</font>

1501
01:34:24,726 --> 01:34:26,343
<font color=#ffff00>Bouc can lie.</font>

1502
01:34:27,035 --> 01:34:28,571
<font color=#ffff00>I can not.</font>

1503
01:34:32,611 --> 01:34:35,953
<font color=#ffff00>Do it! One of you!</font>

1504
01:34:36,526 --> 01:34:37,787
<font color=#ffff00>No.</font>

1505
01:34:38,368 --> 01:34:41,008
<font color=#ffff00>I already died with Daisy.</font>

1506
01:34:42,572 --> 01:34:43,572
<font color=#ffff00>No!</font>

1507
01:35:24,871 --> 01:35:27,394
<font color=#ffff00>You said your role was to find justice.</font>

1508
01:35:27,657 --> 01:35:29,894
<font color=#ffff00>What is justice here?</font>

1509
01:35:32,723 --> 01:35:34,984
<font color=#ffff00>Sometimes, the law of man is not enough.</font>

1510
01:35:36,882 --> 01:35:38,814
<font color=#ffff00>Where does conscience lie?</font>

1511
01:35:41,340 --> 01:35:43,864
<font color=#ffff00>Buried with Daisy.</font>

1512
01:38:04,890 --> 01:38:08,020
<font color=#ffff00><i>My Dear Colonel Armstrong.</i></font>

1513
01:38:09,142 --> 01:38:12,095
<font color=#ffff00><i>Finally, I can answer your letter...</i></font>

1514
01:38:12,326 --> 01:38:17,614
<font color=#ffff00><i>at least with the thoughts in head
and the feeling in my heart...</i></font>

1515
01:38:17,894 --> 01:38:21,111
<font color=#ffff00><i>that, somewhere,
you can hear me.</i></font>

1516
01:38:22,214 --> 01:38:26,072
<font color=#ffff00><i>I've now discovered the truth of
the case, and it is...</i></font>

1517
01:38:26,229 --> 01:38:28,681
<font color=#ffff00><i>profoundly disturbing.</i></font>

1518
01:38:29,744 --> 01:38:33,003
<font color=#ffff00><i>I have seen the fracture of the human soul.</i></font>

1519
01:38:33,477 --> 01:38:38,315
<font color=#ffff00><i>So many broken lives, so
much pain and anger...</i></font>

1520
01:38:38,481 --> 01:38:42,171
<font color=#ffff00><i>giving way to the poison
of deep grief...</i></font>

1521
01:38:42,402 --> 01:38:45,661
<font color=#ffff00><i>until one crime became many.</i></font>

1522
01:38:47,270 --> 01:38:52,869
<font color=#ffff00><i>I have always wanted to believe
that man is rational and civilized.</i></font>

1523
01:38:53,093 --> 01:38:56,263
<font color=#ffff00><i>My very existence depends
upon this hope...</i></font>

1524
01:38:56,528 --> 01:39:01,585
<font color=#ffff00><i>upon order, and methods
and the little gray cells.</i></font>

1525
01:39:02,690 --> 01:39:05,795
<font color=#ffff00><i>But now, perhaps, I'm asked...</i></font>

1526
01:39:06,202 --> 01:39:08,194
<font color=#ffff00><i>to listen instead...</i></font>

1527
01:39:09,179 --> 01:39:11,131
<font color=#ffff00><i>to my heart.</i></font>

1528
01:39:17,048 --> 01:39:18,500
<font color=#ffff00>Ladies and gentlemen...</font>

1529
01:39:20,125 --> 01:39:24,144
<font color=#ffff00>I have understood in this case
that the scales of justice...</font>

1530
01:39:24,314 --> 01:39:26,766
<font color=#ffff00>cannot always be evenly weighed.</font>

1531
01:39:28,030 --> 01:39:30,326
<font color=#ffff00>And I must learn, for once...</font>

1532
01:39:30,522 --> 01:39:33,458
<font color=#ffff00>to live with the imbalance.</font>

1533
01:39:35,130 --> 01:39:37,226
<font color=#ffff00>There are no killers here.</font>

1534
01:39:37,510 --> 01:39:40,682
<font color=#ffff00>Only the people who deserve
a chance to heal.</font>

1535
01:39:41,757 --> 01:39:44,378
<font color=#ffff00>The police have accepted my
first solution to the crime...</font>

1536
01:39:44,639 --> 01:39:47,462
<font color=#ffff00>the lone assassin who made his escape.</font>

1537
01:39:48,400 --> 01:39:51,975
<font color=#ffff00>I will leave the train
here to conclude formalities.</font>

1538
01:39:52,997 --> 01:39:54,896
<font color=#ffff00>You are all free to go.</font>

1539
01:39:56,240 --> 01:39:58,893
<font color=#ffff00>May you find your peace with this.</font>

1540
01:40:01,263 --> 01:40:02,888
<font color=#ffff00>May we all.</font>

1541
01:40:17,892 --> 01:40:18,892
<font color=#ffff00>Hello.</font>

1542
01:40:19,482 --> 01:40:23,749
<font color=#ffff00>I'm looking for a Mr Poirot.
He is needed on a very urgent matter.</font>

1543
01:40:24,997 --> 01:40:26,725
<font color=#ffff00>He is on holiday.</font>

1544
01:40:29,093 --> 01:40:30,981
<font color=#ffff00>The Kassner case again?</font>

1545
01:40:31,162 --> 01:40:33,476
<font color=#ffff00>No, sir, far worse.</font>

1546
01:40:33,736 --> 01:40:35,536
<font color=#ffff00>I have to take you to
Egypt straight away.</font>

1547
01:40:35,683 --> 01:40:39,139
<font color=#ffff00>There was a murder, sir,
right on the bloody Nile.</font>

1548
01:40:41,957 --> 01:40:43,613
<font color=#ffff00>Are you the detective?</font>

1549
01:40:45,221 --> 01:40:46,330
<font color=#ffff00>Yes.</font>

1550
01:40:48,324 --> 01:40:50,383
<font color=#ffff00>I am the detective.</font>

1551
01:40:51,060 --> 01:40:53,146
<font color=#ffff00>Could you please straighten your tie?</font>

1552
01:40:57,009 --> 01:40:58,086
<font color=#ffff00>I will see you at the car.</font>

1553
01:41:52,879 --> 01:41:54,199
<font color=#ffff00>Here it is, sir.</font>
