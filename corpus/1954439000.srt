for me while you're out there.

Um, two fishing rods in
the garage, and a tackle box.

It's in the basement.

If your mother wants that,

119

she's gonna have to pry it out
of my cold, dead hands.

120

Ok, I probably should have
told you this earlier,

00:09:13,387 --> 00:09:16,655

a few people to come

know anything about that,

I'm here to tell you
that's not the case.

185
00:11:17,511 --> 00:11:19,844
While you're in my town
you best behave,

186
00:11:19,846 --> 00:11:21,346
or you're gonna have
to deal with me

187
00:11:21,348 --> 00:11:22,580
and you don't want to do that.

188
00:11:22,582 --> 00:11:23,715
Are we clear?

189
00:11:23,717 --> 00:11:25,950
Yes, sir.

190
00:11:25,952 --> 00:11:27,252
I'm gonna give you a warning.

191
00:11:27,254 --> 00:11:29,754
Thank you.

192
00:11:29,756 --> 00:11:31,623
No more fuckin' around.

193
00:11:31,625 --> 00:11:32,791
Got it?

194
00:11:32,793 --> 00:11:33,525
Yes, thank you.

195
00:11:33,527 --> 00:11:35,727
We're not gonna be a problem.

196
00:11:37,864 --> 00:11:39,664
Yep.

197
00:11:40,801 --> 00:11:43,368
Remind me to punch you
in the dick, Seth.

198
00:11:53,113 --> 00:11:56,481
Wow, this is amazing!

199
00:11:56,483 --> 00:11:58,750
It's beautiful out here.

200
00:11:58,752 --> 00:12:00,885
Yeah, April, when you
said cabin in the woods

201
00:12:00,887 --> 00:12:04,222
I thought this was gonna be
a total shithole.

202
00:12:15,135 --> 00:12:16,935
Oh, yeah!

203
00:12:16,937 --> 00:12:18,903
Fuckin' A!

204
00:12:18,905 --> 00:12:21,372
This is what I'm talkin' about!

205
00:12:22,776 --> 00:12:24,242
This is such a trip.

206
00:12:25,812 --> 00:12:29,414
Last time I was here,
we were in middle school.

207
00:12:29,416 --> 00:12:36,121
Yeah, we used to come out
here every summer.

208
00:12:36,123 --> 00:12:37,489
I'm gonna go grab my camera,

209
00:12:37,491 --> 00:12:39,257
hopefully I can get all the
rooms before it gets dark out.

210
00:12:39,259 --> 00:12:40,259
Do you need help?

211
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:42,460
No, it's ok baby, I got it.
Alright.

212
00:12:42,462 --> 00:12:43,622
Hey, think fast, fuckhead!

213
00:12:46,933 --> 00:12:48,666
Bottoms up, motherfuckers!

214
00:12:49,770 --> 00:12:52,837
[dance music]

215
00:13:21,568 --> 00:13:24,335
I figured it was coyotes, so I
replaced the whole damn fence.

216
00:13:24,337 --> 00:13:27,372
Now I don't know what to think.

217
00:13:27,374 --> 00:13:33,111
Well, it doesn't look like
coyotes, Rick.

218
00:13:33,113 --> 00:13:35,513
It's too perfect,
too clean.

219
00:13:35,515 --> 00:13:37,982
If this keeps up, I'm not
gonna survive the season.

220
00:13:37,984 --> 00:13:40,018
I'm gonna get animal control
down here,

221
00:13:40,020 --> 00:13:41,853
get things cleared up, ok?

222
00:13:41,855 --> 00:13:45,456
You take care.

223
00:13:51,798 --> 00:13:53,998
I'm over here at
the Riseman farm,

224
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:58,102
got another animal mutilation
same as the others.

225
00:13:58,104 --> 00:13:59,838
<i>Copy that, sheriff.</i>

226
00:14:10,817 --> 00:14:13,985
What the hell is going on
in this town, huh?

227
00:14:14,454 --> 00:14:15,704
No.
Yeah.

228
00:14:15,705 --> 00:14:16,955
Oh my God, I can't believe you
slept with that guy.

229
00:14:16,957 --> 00:14:18,423
Yeah.
No!

230
00:14:18,425 --> 00:14:21,292
Yeah!
He was, like, forty
and so guido!

231
00:14:21,294 --> 00:14:22,727
Oh, whatever.

232
00:14:22,729 --> 00:14:26,698
He was hot.

233
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:28,600
So um...

234
00:14:28,602 --> 00:14:32,003
NYU probably has a pretty
good writing program.

235
00:14:32,005 --> 00:14:35,673
You know, it would probably
be easy to transfer there.

236
00:14:35,675 --> 00:14:37,041
What?
For Kyle.

237
00:14:37,043 --> 00:14:39,143
If he wanted to go with you.

238
00:14:39,145 --> 00:14:41,112
Melanie, I put a lot of thought
into this, ok?

239
00:14:41,114 --> 00:14:43,014
I just don't see it happening.

240
00:14:43,016 --> 00:14:44,382
I don't know,

241
00:14:44,384 --> 00:14:47,452
it's just that there are a lot
of douchebag guys out there,

242
00:14:47,454 --> 00:14:49,954
and Kyle isn't one of them.

243
00:14:49,956 --> 00:14:51,256
You guys are great together.

244
00:14:51,258 --> 00:14:52,557
I know we are, I just...

245
00:14:52,559 --> 00:14:54,659
I don't want to be one of
those girls that marries

246
00:14:54,661 --> 00:14:56,995
her high school sweetheart and
then pops out three kids

247
00:14:56,997 --> 00:14:58,730
and wonders what could
have been.

248
00:14:58,732 --> 00:15:00,832
Look, all I'm saying is
that, you know,

249
00:15:00,834 --> 00:15:05,270
maybe you should just think
about it a little bit more.

250
00:15:05,272 --> 00:15:06,905
[dog barking]

251
00:15:06,907 --> 00:15:08,673
What?

252
00:15:08,675 --> 00:15:10,174
What is it?
What the fuck?

253
00:15:10,176 --> 00:15:11,309
What the fuck's your problem?

254
00:15:11,311 --> 00:15:12,744
[dog barking]

255
00:15:12,746 --> 00:15:14,879
Rusty, stop
being so aggro.

256
00:15:14,881 --> 00:15:16,648
[leash snaps]
Fucking Rusty!

257
00:15:16,650 --> 00:15:17,650
Come back here!

258
00:15:17,651 --> 00:15:18,316
Rusty!

259
00:15:18,318 --> 00:15:20,551
Fucking dumb dog.

260
00:15:20,553 --> 00:15:21,920
Rusty!

261
00:15:32,065 --> 00:15:33,364
Fuck.

262
00:15:33,366 --> 00:15:35,733
I think he's back there.

263
00:15:35,735 --> 00:15:38,503
Rusty!

264
00:15:38,505 --> 00:15:40,338
Rusty!

265
00:15:47,147 --> 00:15:48,780
Really, Mel?

266
00:15:51,484 --> 00:15:53,451
Don't be a square.

267
00:15:53,453 --> 00:15:55,253
Come on.

268
00:16:04,597 --> 00:16:05,630
Wow.

269
00:16:05,632 --> 00:16:09,701
What a shithole.

270
00:16:09,703 --> 00:16:12,837
Fuck, I think he's back there.

271
00:16:12,839 --> 00:16:17,542
[dog barking in distance]

272
00:16:19,346 --> 00:16:21,346
Holy shit, Melanie, look.

273
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:25,149
Oh. My.

274
00:16:25,151 --> 00:16:26,684
God.

275
00:16:26,686 --> 00:16:28,953
Score!

276
00:16:35,362 --> 00:16:37,895
Thank you, God, thank you, God.

277
00:16:37,897 --> 00:16:40,665
Ok, remember, we're here to
find the dog.

278
00:16:40,667 --> 00:16:42,667
What dog?

279
00:16:46,106 --> 00:16:48,272
Oh.

280
00:16:52,012 --> 00:16:53,678
[sniffs bag]

281
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:56,948
Mmm, sweet Jesus,
it's a miracle!

282
00:16:56,950 --> 00:16:57,615
Melanie, put it down.

283
00:16:57,617 --> 00:16:59,250
Come on.
This is sketch.

284
00:16:59,252 --> 00:17:01,052
It's probably some drug
dealer's stash.

285
00:17:01,054 --> 00:17:02,220
Can I just take one bag?

286
00:17:02,222 --> 00:17:03,187
No!

287
00:17:03,189 --> 00:17:05,289
I don't wanna get killed!

288
00:17:07,027 --> 00:17:11,262
Ok, fine.
Fine.

289
00:17:11,264 --> 00:17:12,397
There you are!

290
00:17:12,399 --> 00:17:13,931
Don't do that again.

291
00:17:13,933 --> 00:17:15,900
Come on, let's go ok?

292
00:17:15,902 --> 00:17:17,201
Oh my God!

293
00:17:17,203 --> 00:17:19,170
[muffled] What are you
doing on my property?

294
00:17:19,172 --> 00:17:21,139
We weren't trying to steal
anything, I promise!

295
00:17:21,141 --> 00:17:22,340
You're trespassing!

296
00:17:22,342 --> 00:17:24,142
No, no, no, my dog just
ran back here

297
00:17:24,144 --> 00:17:25,476
and we came back to get him!

298
00:17:25,478 --> 00:17:26,978
Who sent you?

299
00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:28,579
Who sent you?

300
00:17:28,581 --> 00:17:31,082
My parents own a cabin right
down the road!

301
00:17:35,121 --> 00:17:36,954
April?

302
00:17:38,491 --> 00:17:40,925
I know you?

303
00:17:40,927 --> 00:17:41,893
Hell, I haven't seen you

304
00:17:41,895 --> 00:17:45,329
since you were knee high
to a bait pail.

305
00:17:46,966 --> 00:17:48,516
Remember?

306
00:17:48,517 --> 00:17:50,067
Your dad and I used to take
you fishing out on the lake!

308
00:17:51,104 --> 00:17:53,304

00:18:00,947 --> 00:18:03,648
Sorry for spookin'
you guys back there,

311
00:18:03,650 --> 00:18:06,350
I don't get many visitors.

312
00:18:06,352 --> 00:18:08,886
I see somebody on my property,

313
00:18:08,888 --> 00:18:11,522
they're usually here lookin'
for trouble.

314
00:18:14,194 --> 00:18:16,661
Is this you?

315
00:18:16,663 --> 00:18:21,799
Oh yeah, a little green
behind the ears in that one.

316
00:18:21,801 --> 00:18:26,170
So uh, were you in, like,
Vietnam or whatever?

317
00:18:26,172 --> 00:18:29,006
Uh huh.

318
00:18:29,008 --> 00:18:32,110
'67 through '71.

Brave as shit.

320
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:37,615
I've seen things...

321
00:18:37,617 --> 00:18:41,686
things your generation
just wouldn't understand.

322
00:18:41,688 --> 00:18:44,422
Hey, what's that thing?

323
00:18:44,424 --> 00:18:47,825
Ah.

324
00:18:47,827 --> 00:18:50,461
My motion activated thermal
cameras picked this one up

325
00:18:50,463 --> 00:18:52,230
last week.

326
00:18:52,232 --> 00:18:54,132
What is it?

327
00:18:54,134 --> 00:18:55,333
What do you think it is?

328
00:18:55,335 --> 00:18:56,634
Secret military air craft!

329
00:18:56,636 --> 00:18:58,469
They've been using this
whole area for test flying

330
00:18:58,471 --> 00:19:00,972
ever since the end of
the Cold War.

331
00:19:00,974 --> 00:19:03,074
Maybe things have been
heating up.

332
00:19:03,076 --> 00:19:06,110
Just last night I tracked
one of these babies going

333
00:19:06,112 --> 00:19:07,645
about 2400 clicks an hour,

334
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:09,046
it stopped right on
a goddamn dime,

335
00:19:09,048 --> 00:19:13,251
did a 180 quicker than
any aircraft known to man.

336
00:19:13,253 --> 00:19:14,685
You had to see it.

337
00:19:14,687 --> 00:19:15,753
No way!

338
00:19:15,755 --> 00:19:18,122
Way.

339
00:19:19,225 --> 00:19:21,692
Oh, you guys are so young,

340
00:19:21,694 --> 00:19:26,063
you have no idea what's going
on out there.

341
00:19:26,065 --> 00:19:28,933
Why should you?

342
00:19:28,935 --> 00:19:31,102
When I was your age,

343
00:19:31,104 --> 00:19:36,741
I thought the world was a good
and fair place.

344
00:19:36,743 --> 00:19:39,410
I've seen some shit since then.

345
00:19:40,647 --> 00:19:42,013
People nowadays live
in their naive,

346
00:19:42,015 --> 00:19:46,584
comfortable bubble worlds, and
the people behind the curtain

347
00:19:46,586 --> 00:19:48,152
want to keep them that way.

348
00:19:48,154 --> 00:19:50,454
The last thing they want
is an informed,

349
00:19:50,456 --> 00:19:52,657

00:19:55,328 --> 00:19:56,594
<i>Yeah.</i>

352
00:19:56,596 --> 00:19:58,196
People out there, they think
they're free,

353
00:19:58,198 --> 00:20:00,464
but they couldn't be further
from the truth.

354
00:20:00,466 --> 00:20:02,533
That's why you gotta stay
off the radar.

355
00:20:02,535 --> 00:20:05,036
Keep off the grid.

356
00:20:09,075 --> 00:20:14,712
'Cause they're out there,
and they're watching.

357
00:20:16,916 --> 00:20:20,618
So, um, can I buy some weed?

358
00:20:24,023 --> 00:20:26,290
Of course you can.

359
00:20:26,292 --> 00:20:27,491
So then, I was like

360
00:20:27,493 --> 00:20:28,359
Oh.

361
00:20:28,361 --> 00:20:29,460
My.

362
00:20:29,462 --> 00:20:30,795
God.

363
00:20:30,797 --> 00:20:31,963
And I was, like, freaking
out and I felt super dizzy

364
00:20:31,965 --> 00:20:33,331
and out of it,
and I mean,

365
00:20:33,333 --> 00:20:34,332
I was having a full on
panic attack

366
00:20:34,334 --> 00:20:35,533
in the middle
of the club!

367
00:20:35,535 --> 00:20:37,635
All of my friends were
totally like TTYL,

368
00:20:37,637 --> 00:20:38,803
I didn't know what to do.

369
00:20:38,805 --> 00:20:40,805
So anyway, out of nowhere,
he comes over

370
00:20:40,807 --> 00:20:44,208
and he's all like
hey, are you alright?

371
00:20:44,210 --> 00:20:47,111
He takes me to his dorm and he
takes care of me all night

372
00:20:47,113 --> 00:20:48,913
and he gives me water

373
00:20:48,915 --> 00:20:51,382
and I just knew he was
the right guy for me.

374
00:20:51,384 --> 00:20:54,685
<i>So yeah, that's how we met.</i>

375
00:20:56,356 --> 00:20:59,223
Wow, that sounds amazing.

376
00:20:59,225 --> 00:21:01,492
<i>I know, right?</i>

377
00:21:02,262 --> 00:21:03,394
Hey, um...

378
00:21:03,396 --> 00:21:05,329
can I talk to you for a second?

379
00:21:05,331 --> 00:21:07,164
Just, like, upstairs?

380
00:21:07,166 --> 00:21:09,834
Yeah, ok, sure.

381
00:21:20,446 --> 00:21:22,366
Actually, could you close
the door?

382
00:21:23,182 --> 00:21:23,881
Are you ok?

383
00:21:23,883 --> 00:21:25,149
You're acting really weird.

384
00:21:25,151 --> 00:21:27,118
Yeah, no, I'm fine.

385
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:30,254
Um, so I uh...

386
00:21:33,159 --> 00:21:34,592
I don't know how
to say this, really.

387
00:21:34,594 --> 00:21:35,626
Um...

388
00:21:35,628 --> 00:21:37,328
Say what?

389
00:21:41,034 --> 00:21:43,901
You know that I care
about you a lot, right?

390
00:21:43,903 --> 00:21:45,970
Yeah, of course I do.

391
00:21:45,972 --> 00:21:48,172
What is it?

392
00:21:48,174 --> 00:21:49,340
Ok, here goes.

393
00:21:49,342 --> 00:21:51,642
Um...

394
00:21:51,644 --> 00:21:57,682
April, we know each other
inside and out,

395
00:21:57,684 --> 00:21:58,849
and the last three years
have been

396
00:21:58,851 --> 00:22:01,419
the best three
years of my life.

397
00:22:01,421 --> 00:22:03,554
I love waking up next to you,

398
00:22:03,556 --> 00:22:06,691
and I want to keep waking
up next to you

399
00:22:06,693 --> 00:22:09,560
for the rest of my life.

400
00:22:09,562 --> 00:22:12,596
So...

401
00:22:12,598 --> 00:22:15,533
What are you doing, Kyle?

402
00:22:15,535 --> 00:22:18,836
April, what do you say?

403
00:22:18,838 --> 00:22:23,374
You want to keep waking up
next to me, too?

404
00:22:23,376 --> 00:22:26,143
Kyle, are you serious?

405
00:22:26,145 --> 00:22:28,112
Is that a yes?

406
00:22:28,114 --> 00:22:32,583
I don't know.

407
00:22:32,585 --> 00:22:35,953
You don't know?

408
00:22:35,955 --> 00:22:37,788
Oh, fuck.

409
00:22:43,062 --> 00:22:47,264
You can't leave me
hanging here.

410
00:22:53,139 --> 00:22:55,373
Kyle, I...

411
00:22:55,375 --> 00:22:56,941
I can't.

412
00:22:56,943 --> 00:22:59,310
But why?

413
00:22:59,312 --> 00:23:02,012
Fuck, I haven't told you
this yet.

414
00:23:02,014 --> 00:23:06,050
I... I didn't want it to be
like this.

415
00:23:06,052 --> 00:23:09,186
I got a job offer in New York.

416
00:23:09,188 --> 00:23:10,154
New York?

417
00:23:10,156 --> 00:23:11,222
Yeah.

418
00:23:11,224 --> 00:23:15,159
When does it start?

419
00:23:15,161 --> 00:23:18,262
The middle of May.

420
00:23:18,264 --> 00:23:19,714
That's like a month away!

421
00:23:19,715 --> 00:23:21,165
When the hell were you
gonna tell me this?

422
00:23:21,167 --> 00:23:22,967
This weekend, but
then you ended up

423
00:23:22,969 --> 00:23:25,236
inviting a bunch of people
over here.

424
00:23:25,238 --> 00:23:26,470
That's right in the middle
of the semester,

425
00:23:26,472 --> 00:23:30,741
I can't transfer that quickly.

426
00:23:32,912 --> 00:23:34,412
What, did you not
want me to go with you?

427
00:23:34,414 --> 00:23:35,413
No, Kyle, I didn't say that.

428
00:23:35,415 --> 00:23:36,514
I just...

429
00:23:36,516 --> 00:23:37,314
I...

430
00:23:37,316 --> 00:23:39,116
Oh my God.

431
00:23:39,118 --> 00:23:43,087
You're breaking up with me.
No, no Kyle, I just...

432
00:23:43,089 --> 00:23:44,522
I don't know if I'm ever
gonna get another opportunity

433
00:23:44,524 --> 00:23:46,857
like this again.

434
00:23:48,761 --> 00:23:51,328
Oh, I'm such an idiot.

435
00:23:51,330 --> 00:23:52,930
I'm such a fucking idiot.

436
00:23:52,932 --> 00:23:54,432
Kyle...

437
00:23:56,502 --> 00:23:58,736
Kyle, don't walk away.

438
00:23:59,739 --> 00:24:02,406
(All): SURPRISE!

439
00:24:02,408 --> 00:24:04,408
Let's get this motherfucking
party start...

440
00:24:04,410 --> 00:24:07,344
Fuck off, Seth.

441
00:24:09,582 --> 00:24:10,281
You said no?

442
00:24:10,283 --> 00:24:12,716
Seth!

443
00:24:14,954 --> 00:24:17,721
<i>That is some cold ass shit.</i>

444
00:25:03,169 --> 00:25:07,371
Welcome to the gayest
surprise party ever!

445
00:25:07,373 --> 00:25:09,640
Not only did the surprise
completely backfire,

446
00:25:09,642 --> 00:25:13,410
but there's no TV, there's no
cell phone service,

447
00:25:13,412 --> 00:25:18,482
and I just got the worst news
that my chick is on the rag.

448
00:25:18,484 --> 00:25:20,451
In this corner we have Kyle,

449
00:25:20,453 --> 00:25:22,820
who has just taken a merciless
beating from April

450
00:25:22,822 --> 00:25:24,355
and could be out for the count.

451
00:25:24,357 --> 00:25:26,073
Hey!

452
00:25:26,074 --> 00:25:28,034
Say something for the camera,
champ!

453
00:25:30,062 --> 00:25:32,129
<i>Come here, you fuckin'
dumb dog.</i>

454
00:25:32,131 --> 00:25:35,099
<i>Oh yeah, gimme this shit.</i>

455
00:25:35,101 --> 00:25:38,569
<i>What are these dirty sluts
up to?</i>

456
00:25:38,571 --> 00:25:40,671
Fuck, I just wish it didn't
have to go down like that.

457
00:25:40,673 --> 00:25:41,772
I fucking care about him.

458
00:25:41,774 --> 00:25:42,873
Are you filming this?

459
00:25:42,875 --> 00:25:44,275
That is some fucked up shit.

460
00:25:44,277 --> 00:25:46,710
I mean really, who says
no to a guy on one knee?

461
00:25:46,712 --> 00:25:47,811
Seth, fuck off.

462
00:25:47,813 --> 00:25:50,648
I just, I'm trying to understand
the situation.

463
00:25:50,650 --> 00:25:51,482
So am I.

464
00:25:51,484 --> 00:25:52,683
Seth.

465
00:25:52,685 --> 00:25:55,653
I thought we were
happy together.

466
00:25:55,655 --> 00:25:56,720
I'm Kyle, remember?

467
00:25:56,722 --> 00:25:57,888
We're in it for the long haul.

468
00:25:57,890 --> 00:25:59,623
Where you go, I go.

469
00:25:59,625 --> 00:26:01,325
He fuckin' loves you, April.

470
00:26:01,327 --> 00:26:02,092
Enough.

471
00:26:02,094 --> 00:26:04,328
Seth, get the fuck out of here.

472
00:26:04,330 --> 00:26:05,963
I care about you, but...

473
00:26:05,965 --> 00:26:06,797
But what?

474
00:26:06,799 --> 00:26:07,831
But what?

475
00:26:07,833 --> 00:26:09,266
I fucking love you
and you love me.

476
00:26:09,268 --> 00:26:12,536
I don't even think I believe in
the concept of marriage, Kyle.

477
00:26:12,538 --> 00:26:14,204
Look how well it turned out
for my parents,

478
00:26:14,206 --> 00:26:16,173
they can't stand each other!

479
00:26:16,175 --> 00:26:17,541
But you are the one for me.

480
00:26:17,543 --> 00:26:19,710
Kyle, that is just something
we are raised to believe

481
00:26:19,712 --> 00:26:21,845
that we're supposed to want, ok?

482
00:26:21,847 --> 00:26:23,247
The one, you know?

483
00:26:23,249 --> 00:26:24,982
Like it's some magical
fucking thing

484
00:26:24,984 --> 00:26:26,550
that is going to complete us
and it's crap!

485
00:26:26,552 --> 00:26:27,585
Are you listening to me?

486
00:26:27,587 --> 00:26:29,353
What are you talking about?

487
00:26:29,355 --> 00:26:30,955
I'm saying that at the end
of the day,

488
00:26:30,957 --> 00:26:33,424
we're all just alone
in the universe.

489
00:26:33,426 --> 00:26:36,860
April, that is the worst
fucking logic...

490
00:26:36,862 --> 00:26:37,962
What the fuck is that?

491
00:26:37,964 --> 00:26:41,832
[rumbling]

492
00:26:41,834 --> 00:26:47,605
[explosion]

493
00:26:47,607 --> 00:26:48,906
What the fuck?

494
00:26:48,908 --> 00:26:49,840
Holy shit!

495
00:26:49,842 --> 00:26:51,308
What was that?

496
00:26:51,310 --> 00:26:52,409
Holy fuck!

497
00:26:52,411 --> 00:26:53,377
[more explosions]

498
00:26:53,379 --> 00:26:54,645
Oh my God!

499
00:26:57,717 --> 00:26:58,782
We gotta go!

500
00:26:58,784 --> 00:27:00,517
Leave this shit! Let's go!

501
00:27:00,519 --> 00:27:01,619
No way, man!

502
00:27:01,621 --> 00:27:03,887
What the fuck, April?

503
00:27:03,889 --> 00:27:04,788
Melanie!

504
00:27:04,790 --> 00:27:05,889
Shit!

505
00:27:08,127 --> 00:27:10,127
What the hell is that?

506
00:27:10,129 --> 00:27:14,431
Are we really fucking
doing this shit?

507
00:27:14,433 --> 00:27:21,038
Fuck sakes man, I'm too fucking
drunk for this shit, man.

508
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:22,973
Come on, hurry the fuck up.

509
00:27:22,975 --> 00:27:24,675
Fuck.

510
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:29,179
Oh my God.

511
00:27:29,181 --> 00:27:30,914
What the hell is that?

512
00:27:30,916 --> 00:27:33,283
It's an airplane, right?

513
00:27:33,285 --> 00:27:36,820
I don't know, maybe man,
but what's with the red light?

514
00:27:36,822 --> 00:27:38,355
I don't fuckin' know, man.

515
00:27:38,357 --> 00:27:39,490
Seth!

516
00:27:49,802 --> 00:27:52,670
Is that what I think it is?

517
00:28:00,813 --> 00:28:04,682
Oh my God, this is fucked up!

518
00:28:05,518 --> 00:28:09,053
What is this?

519
00:28:09,055 --> 00:28:11,188
I know one thing for sure
it's not,

520
00:28:11,190 --> 00:28:14,358
this is definitely
not an airplane!

521
00:28:20,933 --> 00:28:23,233
No way.

522
00:28:32,578 --> 00:28:35,679
This is so light,
it's like tinfoil.

523
00:28:35,681 --> 00:28:39,850
Do you think it's a military
thing like Travis was saying?

524
00:28:39,852 --> 00:28:41,185
It has to be.

525
00:28:41,187 --> 00:28:44,021
Ok, seriously, fuck this!

526
00:28:44,023 --> 00:28:45,355
This is not fucking happening!

527
00:28:45,357 --> 00:28:47,057
I'm going back to the car.

528
00:28:47,059 --> 00:28:48,525
Yeah, yeah, yeah baby,
I'm with you.

529
00:28:48,527 --> 00:28:51,795
Yo, yo guys, let's go.

530
00:28:51,797 --> 00:28:52,963
Come on, let's go!

531
00:28:52,965 --> 00:28:54,598
Seth?

532
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:56,767
Look at this!

533
00:29:03,743 --> 00:29:05,609
Yo, yo, yo!

534
00:29:05,611 --> 00:29:07,711
Come check this out!

535
00:29:10,082 --> 00:29:12,015
Get over here!

536
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:16,053
Come on.

537
00:29:18,858 --> 00:29:20,691
Holy shit.

538
00:29:30,836 --> 00:29:33,437
Are those footprints?

539
00:29:34,573 --> 00:29:37,641
[thunder]

540
00:29:58,164 --> 00:29:59,797
Seriously?

541
00:30:02,735 --> 00:30:04,334
Fuck.

542
00:30:05,838 --> 00:30:07,004
Hey, you got the video?

543
00:30:07,006 --> 00:30:08,839
I want to see the video.

544
00:30:11,410 --> 00:30:13,677
<i>[on video] I know one thing
for sure it's not,</i>

545
00:30:13,679 --> 00:30:16,046
<i>this is definitely not
an airplane!</i>

546
00:30:16,048 --> 00:30:17,014

No, it's gotta be
something else.

I couldn't stop them.

734
00:44:12,017 --> 00:44:14,617
They held me down.

735
00:44:14,619 --> 00:44:17,453
Oh, God.

736
00:44:36,708 --> 00:44:38,808
Oh, shit.

737
00:44:38,810 --> 00:44:39,842
What the fuck?

738
00:44:39,844 --> 00:44:41,577
What the fuck is happening?

739
00:44:41,579 --> 00:44:42,779
What the fuck was that?

740
00:44:42,781 --> 00:44:45,214
They just fucking took her,
man!

741
00:44:45,216 --> 00:44:46,282
They just fucking took her!

742
00:44:46,284 --> 00:44:47,917
We are fucking fucked!

743
00:44:47,919 --> 00:44:48,985
We're in the middle of
fucking nowhere...

744
00:44:48,987 --> 00:44:49,786
Seth, calm down.

745
00:44:49,788 --> 00:44:50,586
Don't!

746
00:44:50,588 --> 00:44:51,654
Just don't touch me, ok?

747
00:44:51,656 --> 00:44:52,855
I said get the fuck off me!

748
00:44:52,857 --> 00:44:54,424
What the hell
is your problem?

749
00:44:54,426 --> 00:44:56,225
Guys, guys, guys!

750
00:44:56,227 --> 00:44:57,493
Stop!

751
00:44:57,495 --> 00:44:58,761
Look!

752
00:44:58,763 --> 00:45:01,531
It's Travis's place.

753
00:45:01,533 --> 00:45:04,801
Come on.
Let's go.

754
00:45:04,803 --> 00:45:05,868
<i>Yo, you sure this guy's cool?</i>

755
00:45:05,870 --> 00:45:08,538
<i>Yeah, he's totally on the</i>
level.

756
00:45:08,540 --> 00:45:09,672
Nobody move!

757
00:45:09,674 --> 00:45:12,442
Or this one will be dead
before he hits the floor!

758
00:45:12,444 --> 00:45:13,710
Travis, please don't hurt him!

759
00:45:13,712 --> 00:45:16,045
It's just me!

760
00:45:16,047 --> 00:45:18,414
April?

761
00:45:18,416 --> 00:45:21,951
What the hell are you doing,
sneaking up on me?!

762
00:45:21,953 --> 00:45:24,887
We thought you were dead!

763
00:45:24,889 --> 00:45:26,155
No, no.

764
00:45:26,157 --> 00:45:28,591
I've been sleeping with one
eye open for years.

765
00:45:28,593 --> 00:45:31,294
Yeah? You want to let go of me
then, please!

766
00:45:31,296 --> 00:45:33,930
Oh, I'm sorry, son.

767
00:45:33,932 --> 00:45:36,399
Old habits die hard.

768
00:45:37,769 --> 00:45:39,368
I was watching the dolphins

769
00:45:39,370 --> 00:45:43,706
and niner's Super Bowl game
and uh...

770
00:45:43,708 --> 00:45:46,109
must have dozed off.

771
00:45:46,111 --> 00:45:49,879
We didn't mean to scare you,
we just...

772
00:45:49,881 --> 00:45:52,348
didn't know where else
to go.

773
00:45:52,350 --> 00:45:55,051
We're in trouble and need help.

774
00:45:56,888 --> 00:45:59,021
Trouble?

775
00:46:00,625 --> 00:46:04,060
Seth, show him the video.

776
00:46:04,896 --> 00:46:08,798
Video?

777
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:10,733
What video?

778
00:46:10,735 --> 00:46:13,569
You're gonna want to add
this one to your collection.

779
00:46:13,571 --> 00:46:16,572
<i>[on video] This is
definitely not an airplane!</i>

Aliens.

781
00:46:25,917 --> 00:46:29,352
I should have known.

782
00:46:29,354 --> 00:46:32,355
See, everyone within the inner
circle knows that

783
00:46:32,357 --> 00:46:35,258
the US government has had
a treaty

784
00:46:35,260 --> 00:46:38,294
with the extraterrestrials
after since Roswell.

785
00:46:38,296 --> 00:46:42,632
We don't have time for this
conspiracy theory bullshit!

786
00:46:42,634 --> 00:46:43,833
We need to get help!

787
00:46:43,835 --> 00:46:44,534
Now!

788
00:46:44,536 --> 00:46:45,835
Seth!

789
00:46:45,837 --> 00:46:49,438
Let him talk.

790
00:46:53,812 --> 00:46:56,212
What kind of treaty?

791
00:46:58,883 --> 00:47:01,450
Well, the powers that be
turn a blind eye to them

792
00:47:01,452 --> 00:47:03,085
abducting civilians
and doing whatever

793
00:47:03,087 --> 00:47:05,254
the hell it is they
do with them.

794
00:47:05,256 --> 00:47:07,657
And, in turn, we get to run
around down here

795
00:47:07,659 --> 00:47:10,526
as if we own the place.

796
00:47:10,528 --> 00:47:13,830
It's a basic simple agreement
with one cardinal rule:

797
00:47:13,832 --> 00:47:15,832
Do not engage.

798
00:47:15,834 --> 00:47:20,136
And you, you engaged.

799
00:47:20,138 --> 00:47:23,573
What do you mean?

800
00:47:23,575 --> 00:47:25,875
Sweetheart, you shot
one of them.

801
00:47:25,877 --> 00:47:27,310
Broke the treaty.

802
00:47:27,312 --> 00:47:30,213
Now they're out for blood.

803
00:47:30,215 --> 00:47:31,914
You guys, what does this mean?

[sonar beeping]

805
00:47:49,868 --> 00:47:51,434
It's them.

806
00:48:01,012 --> 00:48:03,012
It's gone, right?

807
00:48:03,014 --> 00:48:04,280
Did it fly over us?

808
00:48:04,282 --> 00:48:05,548
No, they landed.

809
00:48:05,550 --> 00:48:06,716
What?

810
00:48:06,718 --> 00:48:09,485
Landed, what do you
mean landed, man?

812
00:48:16,227 --> 00:48:18,561
Oh my God.

813
00:48:22,700 --> 00:48:24,400
It's time to move.

814
00:48:29,240 --> 00:48:30,406
Where are we going?

815
00:48:30,408 --> 00:48:31,507
If you guys go that way,

816
00:48:31,509 --> 00:48:33,042
you'll find a path
back to your place.

817
00:48:33,044 --> 00:48:36,012
Wait, aren't you coming
with us?

818
00:48:36,014 --> 00:48:38,948
Look, nobody invades my property
without expecting a fight.

819
00:48:38,950 --> 00:48:40,500
I'm American.

820
00:48:40,501 --> 00:48:42,051
It's my right to defend
what's mine, and nobody,

821
00:48:42,053 --> 00:48:43,452
not even little green men,

822
00:48:43,454 --> 00:48:45,955
are gonna take that
right away from me.

823
00:48:45,957 --> 00:48:47,890
Now you go, go on.

824
00:48:47,892 --> 00:48:49,759
Go on.

825
00:48:56,968 --> 00:48:59,201
Come and kiss my ass.

826
00:49:12,317 --> 00:49:14,984

829
00:49:43,614 --> 00:49:45,881
Shit.

830
00:50:12,977 --> 00:50:17,313
So we want to play hide
and seek, do we?

831
00:50:21,152 --> 00:50:23,786
Yeah.

You have to help
the others.

What do you mean?

840
00:51:36,094 --> 00:51:38,561
They bring most people back.

841
00:51:38,563 --> 00:51:41,163
Like they did with me.

842
00:51:41,165 --> 00:51:43,599
But not everyone.

843
00:51:43,601 --> 00:51:48,471
There's hundreds of people
still alive up there.

844
00:51:48,473 --> 00:51:51,841
Some of them have been up
there for years.

845
00:51:51,843 --> 00:51:56,245
Maybe even their
whole lives.

846
00:51:56,247 --> 00:51:59,482

just tried to kill us?

gonna sound crazy, ok,

That's why we shot at you,

up all the windows?

918
00:55:52,416 --> 00:55:54,083
UFOs?

919
00:55:54,084 --> 00:55:55,751
Are you fucking listening
to this shit, sheriff?

920
00:55:55,753 --> 00:55:57,720
I mean, take a look around.

921
00:55:57,722 --> 00:56:01,256
There's booze and narcotics
everywhere!

922
00:56:01,258 --> 00:56:04,226
You cannot possibly believe
this load of shit.

923
00:56:04,228 --> 00:56:06,228
Sheriff, I bet we search
the basement,

924
00:56:06,230 --> 00:56:10,366
we'll find us a full-on meth
lab, won't we, you little shit?

925
00:56:10,368 --> 00:56:12,401
We can prove it!

926
00:56:12,403 --> 00:56:13,969
One of them was
in the house.

927
00:56:13,971 --> 00:56:15,371
I shot it.

928
00:56:15,373 --> 00:56:17,206
It's in the pool.

929
00:56:19,410 --> 00:56:21,243
Show me.

930
00:56:21,245 --> 00:56:22,544
Both of you.

931
00:56:22,546 --> 00:56:23,512
You stay put.

932
00:56:23,514 --> 00:56:24,546
Go on.

933
00:56:24,548 --> 00:56:25,981
Ok.

934
00:56:27,118 --> 00:56:28,617
Get up, kid.

935
00:56:35,993 --> 00:56:37,893
Oh my God.

936
00:56:37,895 --> 00:56:41,263
It was right here, I swear.

937
00:56:42,533 --> 00:56:44,099
It wasn't dead.

938
00:56:44,101 --> 00:56:46,168
[glass breaking]

939
00:56:50,508 --> 00:56:53,509
You guys have another
friend hiding back there?

940
00:56:53,511 --> 00:56:54,610
No.

941
00:56:54,612 --> 00:56:56,512
It's just us.

942
00:56:56,514 --> 00:56:57,546
I swear.

943
00:56:57,548 --> 00:56:59,348
Get back in the house.

944
00:56:59,350 --> 00:57:01,183
Now.

945
00:57:12,730 --> 00:57:16,532
Sheriff's department.

946
00:57:16,534 --> 00:57:20,836
If someone's in there, come
out where I can see you.

947
00:57:55,773 --> 00:57:57,406
[thud]

948
00:58:21,765 --> 00:58:28,804
[gooey sounds]

949
00:59:02,840 --> 00:59:06,542
[dog whining]

950
00:59:06,544 --> 00:59:07,609
[startling sounds]

951
00:59:07,611 --> 00:59:10,312
[gunshots]

952
00:59:27,698 --> 00:59:29,531
[unearthly growls]

953
00:59:30,568 --> 00:59:34,303
Oh my God.

954
00:59:34,305 --> 00:59:41,376
So, when they took you on
board their space ship,

955
00:59:42,646 --> 00:59:46,615
did they give you one of them...

956
00:59:46,617 --> 00:59:50,419
you know, anal probes?

957
00:59:50,421 --> 00:59:52,554
Oh yeah, very original
you fucking idiot,

958
00:59:52,556 --> 00:59:54,890
I already told you it was
my girlfriend who got taken,

959
00:59:54,892 --> 00:59:56,391
not me!

960
00:59:56,393 --> 00:59:58,060
Hey!

961
00:59:58,062 --> 01:00:03,332
You know, you ain't got to go
into outer space to get probed.

962
01:00:03,334 --> 01:00:07,736
You'll be getting plenty of
that in the shower every day

963
01:00:07,738 --> 01:00:10,806
from a big guy named Mootombo.

964
01:00:10,808 --> 01:00:13,375
[laughs]

965
01:00:17,147 --> 01:00:20,382
Sheriff, you have got to get
a load of this kid's story.

966
01:00:20,384 --> 01:00:23,118
The boys back at the station,
they're gonna love this!

967
01:00:23,120 --> 01:00:26,388
[laughs]

968
01:00:26,390 --> 01:00:27,756
Sheriff?

969
01:00:27,758 --> 01:00:29,625
Hey, you with me?

970
01:00:32,896 --> 01:00:35,130
They're tellin' the truth.

971
01:00:35,132 --> 01:00:36,865
[laughs]

972
01:00:36,867 --> 01:00:41,069
You see? I fucking told you!

973
01:00:41,071 --> 01:00:43,505
You can't be serious.

974
01:00:43,507 --> 01:00:46,742
I mean, come on man, these kids
are obviously high as kites,

975
01:00:46,744 --> 01:00:48,677
makin' this shit up!

976
01:00:48,679 --> 01:00:49,711
UFOs?

977
01:00:49,713 --> 01:00:50,746
Alien abductions?

978
01:00:50,748 --> 01:00:53,548
I mean, this is horseshit!

979
01:01:00,491 --> 01:01:02,991
It's because of this,
isn't it?

980
01:01:02,993 --> 01:01:06,595
It's been ten years, Alan.

981
01:01:06,597 --> 01:01:10,282
Now look.

982
01:01:10,283 --> 01:01:13,968
I mean no disrespect, but it
is time to face reality.

983
01:01:13,971 --> 01:01:17,005
She left you.

984
01:01:17,007 --> 01:01:19,641
People have been trying
to convince me

985
01:01:19,643 --> 01:01:24,079
that she just split town, just
took off with another guy.

986
01:01:24,081 --> 01:01:25,180
People have been
saying it so long

987
01:01:25,182 --> 01:01:26,848
I almost believed it myself

988
01:01:26,850 --> 01:01:30,118
but now I know
what happened.

989
01:01:30,120 --> 01:01:32,120
What the hell are
you talkin' about?

990
01:01:32,122 --> 01:01:34,923
She would have never done
that to me.

991
01:01:34,925 --> 01:01:37,559
We were in love with each other.

992
01:01:37,561 --> 01:01:41,063
That night I went to bed
sleeping next to her

993
01:01:41,065 --> 01:01:46,735
and I woke up and she was...

994
01:01:46,737 --> 01:01:50,639
she was gone.

995
01:01:50,641 --> 01:01:56,178
She didn't take any of her
clothes, didn't leave a note.

996
01:01:56,180 --> 01:02:00,615
How could she lock the front
door without taking her keys?

997
01:02:00,617 --> 01:02:05,320
I don't know, but I think
you need to accept the fact

998
01:02:05,322 --> 01:02:07,689
that she ain't never
coming back.

999
01:02:07,691 --> 01:02:10,692
If it had been her choice,
Mitchell, then I would.

1000
01:02:10,694 --> 01:02:13,628
But I don't think she had one,
she was taken from me!

1001
01:02:13,630 --> 01:02:15,731
Kidnapped, abducted,
whatever you want to call it,

1002
01:02:15,733 --> 01:02:18,533
but goddammit, what happened
to her is what's happening

1003
01:02:18,535 --> 01:02:20,635
to these kids right now!

1004
01:02:20,637 --> 01:02:23,271
And we gotta get 'em
outta here.

1005
01:02:27,444 --> 01:02:29,911
Woah, what the hell is that?

1006
01:02:29,913 --> 01:02:31,747
What the hell is that!?

1007
01:02:31,749 --> 01:02:33,281
[muffled]

1008
01:02:38,889 --> 01:02:40,722
Oh, shit!

1009
01:02:40,724 --> 01:02:42,124
Start the damn car!

1010
01:03:06,083 --> 01:03:08,717
Woah, woah!

1011
01:03:15,125 --> 01:03:17,058
[gunshot]

1012
01:03:19,763 --> 01:03:21,029
[cocks gun]

1013
01:03:25,836 --> 01:03:26,635
Don't do it!

1014
01:03:26,637 --> 01:03:31,173
[gunshot]

1015
01:03:31,175 --> 01:03:36,077
[muffled]
Fuck!

1016
01:03:36,079 --> 01:03:39,781
Fuck! Shit! Shit!

1017
01:03:53,597 --> 01:03:54,963
Are you ok?

1018
01:03:54,965 --> 01:03:57,365
Get me out of this fucking car!

1019
01:03:57,367 --> 01:03:58,867
Get these things off me,
man!

1020
01:03:58,869 --> 01:04:01,069
Get 'em off, get 'em off!

1021
01:04:01,071 --> 01:04:01,870
What the fuck happened?

1022
01:04:01,872 --> 01:04:04,706
Shit!

1023
01:04:04,708 --> 01:04:06,374
They made him do it!

1024
01:04:06,376 --> 01:04:08,677
They got inside his
fucking head,

1025
01:04:08,679 --> 01:04:11,880
and they made him blow his own
fucking brains out!

1026
01:04:11,882 --> 01:04:13,748
Oh shit.

1027
01:04:13,750 --> 01:04:15,851
Shit, they're gonna take
control of all of us!

1028
01:04:15,853 --> 01:04:16,885
Just stay away from me!

1029
01:04:16,887 --> 01:04:18,320
Seth. Calm down, ok?

1030
01:04:18,322 --> 01:04:19,754
We can't stay here, ok?

1031
01:04:19,756 --> 01:04:22,691
We can't stay here
'cause this shit,
this shit

1032
01:04:22,693 --> 01:04:24,860
is not gonna do
anything, alright?

1033
01:04:24,862 --> 01:04:27,295
We are gonna die in here.

1034
01:04:28,999 --> 01:04:30,198
Give me that cop's gun.

1035
01:04:30,200 --> 01:04:30,999
What?

1036
01:04:31,001 --> 01:04:34,002
I said give me the fucking gun!

1037
01:04:34,004 --> 01:04:35,871
Shut the fuck up, Melanie.

1038
01:04:35,873 --> 01:04:37,505
Put the fucking gun down.
[punched in the face]

1039
01:04:37,507 --> 01:04:39,474
Oh my God!

1040
01:04:39,476 --> 01:04:41,710
I'm the one with the gun,
so you listen to me, ok?

1041
01:04:41,712 --> 01:04:44,212
Do you understand that,
tough guy?

1042
01:04:44,214 --> 01:04:45,146
Seth!

1043
01:04:45,148 --> 01:04:47,482
Back the fuck off!

1044
01:04:49,686 --> 01:04:53,889
Ok everyone, just calm
down, alright?

1045
01:04:53,891 --> 01:04:57,325
Ok, just let me think.

1046
01:04:57,327 --> 01:05:00,829
Just let me think.

1047
01:05:00,831 --> 01:05:04,032
Those fuckers are not gonna
get inside my head.

1048
01:05:04,034 --> 01:05:05,867
Just give me a second,
alright?

1049
01:05:05,869 --> 01:05:09,738
Just, everyone just fucking
calm down.

1050
01:05:09,740 --> 01:05:12,807
These fuckers are not gonna
get inside my head, alright?

1051
01:05:12,809 --> 01:05:14,643
So this is what we're gonna do.

1052
01:05:14,644 --> 01:05:16,478
We're gonna make a break for
town, you're coming with me,

1053
01:05:16,480 --> 01:05:19,214
you get up, you're coming
with me.

1054
01:05:19,216 --> 01:05:22,817
You stay put, because this
is your fault.

1055
01:05:22,819 --> 01:05:23,885
They want you!

1056
01:05:23,887 --> 01:05:26,321
So if they want you,
they can fucking have you!

1057
01:05:26,323 --> 01:05:27,756
You're out of your fucking
mind, Seth!

1058
01:05:27,758 --> 01:05:29,257
We're not leaving
without her.

1059
01:05:29,259 --> 01:05:30,692
Is that right?

1060
01:05:30,694 --> 01:05:32,193
Is that right?

1061
01:05:32,195 --> 01:05:34,629
Well to HELL with you.

1062
01:05:34,631 --> 01:05:37,232
You can all stay here and rot.

1063
01:05:40,804 --> 01:05:44,139
Have fun on your fucking
honeymoon!

1064
01:05:44,141 --> 01:05:46,107
Oh my God, are you ok?

1065
01:05:46,109 --> 01:05:46,942
Yeah.

1066
01:05:46,944 --> 01:05:47,944
Yeah?

1067
01:05:47,945 --> 01:05:50,278
I can see why you didn't
want him to come.

1068
01:05:51,982 --> 01:05:55,050
[dishware rattling]

1069
01:06:05,829 --> 01:06:06,995
You guys?

1070
01:06:19,409 --> 01:06:21,676
[bottle breaks]

1071
01:06:23,080 --> 01:06:25,246
What the fuck was that?

1072
01:06:29,086 --> 01:06:32,954
[glass breaking]

1073
01:06:32,956 --> 01:06:37,359
[screaming]

1074
01:06:37,361 --> 01:06:39,928
What do you want from us?!

1075
01:06:39,930 --> 01:06:40,996
Get away from the window!

1076
01:06:40,998 --> 01:06:41,998
Oh God.

1077
01:06:48,005 --> 01:06:51,072
[painful white noise]

1078
01:06:57,781 --> 01:06:59,114
Oh my God.

1079
01:06:59,116 --> 01:07:02,183
[screaming]

1080
01:07:23,807 --> 01:07:26,875
[exploding]

1081
01:07:52,369 --> 01:07:55,503
[thunderous sounds]

1082
01:07:55,505 --> 01:07:57,105
We gotta get to the basement!

1083
01:07:57,107 --> 01:07:59,474
[thunderous sounds]

1084
01:07:59,476 --> 01:08:00,875
Go, go, go!

1085
01:08:06,450 --> 01:08:08,216
Kyle, let's go!

1086
01:08:12,355 --> 01:08:13,755
Kyle, what're you doing?

1087
01:08:13,757 --> 01:08:15,757
I'm not letting them get
you, babe.

1088
01:08:15,759 --> 01:08:17,192
No, Kyle!

1089
01:08:17,194 --> 01:08:18,093
Open the fucking door!

1090
01:08:18,095 --> 01:08:19,794
No, I'm gonna be ok!

1091
01:08:19,796 --> 01:08:22,630
No, Kyle, please
don't do this!

1092
01:08:22,632 --> 01:08:23,598
Babe, there's no
other choice.

1093
01:08:23,600 --> 01:08:25,867
I have to, I'm sorry.

1094
01:08:25,869 --> 01:08:27,135
You are gonna get
out of here,

1095
01:08:27,137 --> 01:08:28,236
and you're gonna survive.

1096
01:08:28,238 --> 01:08:29,904

that summer before
high school started?

Yeah, it was right before
my parents broke up.

We raided your parents'
liquor cabinet

¶ I love it when you sing
to me. ¶

1286
01:32:16,865 --> 01:32:18,598
Hey! Over here!

1287
01:32:18,600 --> 01:32:22,669
¶ You ¶

1288
01:32:22,671 --> 01:32:25,405
Help us!

1289
01:32:25,407 --> 01:32:27,474
¶

1290
01:32:27,476 --> 01:32:29,843
[gunshot]

1291
01:32:49,131 --> 01:32:50,163
No!

1292
01:32:50,165 --> 01:32:51,431
No, wait!
Wait, wait!

1293
01:32:51,433 --> 01:32:53,667
[gunshots]

1294
01:32:53,669 --> 01:32:56,736
[epic music]

1295
01:34:39,041 --> 01:34:44,177
[gunshots]

1296
01:34:46,782 --> 01:34:48,982
That's the last of them.

1297
01:34:48,984 --> 01:34:50,650
Good.

1298
01:34:50,652 --> 01:34:52,819
Do we know anything yet?

1299
01:34:52,821 --> 01:34:54,905
Intel is still coming in,

1300
01:34:54,906 --> 01:34:56,990
but it looks like
the storm caused the crash,

1301
01:34:56,992 --> 01:34:59,325
like the one last year
in Portugal.

1302
01:34:59,327 --> 01:35:01,127
Fatalities?

1303
01:35:01,129 --> 01:35:03,563
Fairly minimal.

1304
01:35:03,565 --> 01:35:06,466
Stories are already
being prepared.

1305
01:35:06,468 --> 01:35:12,105
What should we do
with the bodies?

1306
01:35:22,718 --> 01:35:25,018
Same thing we always do.

1307
01:35:25,020 --> 01:35:28,088
¶

1308
01:35:48,243 --> 01:35:51,478
¶ When I die and they
lay me to rest, ¶

1309
01:35:51,480 --> 01:35:55,381
¶ gonna go to the place
that's the best. ¶

1310
01:35:55,383 --> 01:35:58,685
¶ When I lay me down
to die, ¶

1311
01:35:58,687 --> 01:36:03,223
¶ goin' up to the spirit
in the sky. ¶

1312
01:36:03,225 --> 01:36:06,693
¶ Goin' up to the spirit
in the sky, ¶

1313
01:36:06,695 --> 01:36:11,064
¶ that's where I'm gonna
go when I die. ¶

1314
01:36:11,066 --> 01:36:13,600
¶ When I die and they
lay me to rest, ¶

1315
01:36:13,602 --> 01:36:17,904
¶ gonna go to the place
that's the best. ¶

1316
01:36:17,906 --> 01:36:20,974
¶

1317
01:36:33,855 --> 01:36:37,490
¶ Prepare yourself,
you know it's a must, ¶

1318
01:36:37,492 --> 01:36:41,461
¶ gotta have a friend
in Jesus, ¶

1319
01:36:41,463 --> 01:36:44,464
¶ so you know that
when you die, ¶

1320
01:36:44,466 --> 01:36:48,802
¶ he's gonna recommend you
to the spirit in the sky. ¶

1321
01:36:48,804 --> 01:36:53,339
¶ Gonna recommend you to
the spirit in the sky, ¶

1322
01:36:53,341 --> 01:36:56,943
¶ that's where you're gonna
go when you die. ¶

1323
01:36:56,945 --> 01:36:59,913
¶ When you die and
they lay you to rest, ¶

1324
01:36:59,915 --> 01:37:01,281
¶ you're gonna go ¶

1325
01:37:01,283 --> 01:37:03,850
¶ to the place
that's the best. ¶

1326
01:37:03,852 --> 01:37:06,920
¶

1327
01:37:35,684 --> 01:37:38,751
¶
