00:00:03,669 --> 00:00:06,419
(dramatic music)

2
00:01:48,776 --> 00:01:51,859
(vultures squawking)

3
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:45,773
- Lunch?

4
00:03:30,262 --> 00:03:32,350
(static buzzing)

5
00:03:32,350 --> 00:03:34,080
David Pennington to Rocky Mountain Lab,

6
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:36,785
listening 145.5, over.

7
00:03:36,785 --> 00:03:38,577
(static buzzing)

8
00:03:38,577 --> 00:03:41,660
(electronic beeping)

9
00:03:42,594 --> 00:03:44,540
This is David Pennington
to Rocky Mountain Lab,

10
00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:47,223
listening 145.5, over.

11
00:03:49,194 --> 00:03:51,170
This is David Pennington
to Rocky Mountain Lab,

12
00:03:51,170 --> 00:03:53,300
listening 145.5, over.

13
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:55,610
- Von, I've got a weak
signal coming in long range

14
00:03:55,610 --> 00:03:56,980
from the outside!

15
00:03:56,980 --> 00:03:58,310
I think it's Pennington!

16
00:03:58,310 --> 00:04:00,042
- [Von] Screw it, we've
got to get Phil inside.

17
00:04:00,042 --> 00:04:01,239
- [David] This is David
Pennington to Rocky Mountain Lab,

18
00:04:01,239 --> 00:04:04,910
listening 145.5, over.
(alarm blaring)

19
00:04:04,910 --> 00:04:06,293
- Damn, I lost him!

20
00:04:06,293 --> 00:04:07,126
- [Kyle] Von, what is it?

21
00:04:07,126 --> 00:04:09,807
- Phil's hurt topside, get him down here!

22
00:04:09,807 --> 00:04:11,791
(alarm blaring)

23
00:04:11,791 --> 00:04:12,682
- What's the status, Von?

24
00:04:12,682 --> 00:04:15,400
- [Von] He's been mauled,
now standby to help out.

25
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:16,800
- Phil's in the antechamber.

26
00:04:18,311 --> 00:04:21,600
- Kara, get to control, I need you, stat.

27
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,532
- I'll be right there.

28
00:04:23,532 --> 00:04:26,199
(alarm blaring)

29
00:04:36,651 --> 00:04:39,318
- Just give me this.
- Excuse me!

30
00:04:48,233 --> 00:04:49,277
- I lost what I had.

31
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:51,113
It's just not enough.

32
00:04:51,113 --> 00:04:53,370
- Come on, let's get him out of here.

33
00:05:03,962 --> 00:05:05,423
- Let's get him in med bay, quick.

34
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:07,573
Oh!

35
00:05:09,254 --> 00:05:12,957
- There wasn't enough to
make vaccine for everyone.

36
00:05:14,625 --> 00:05:17,063
I must have lost what I had.

37
00:05:19,405 --> 00:05:20,497
I'm sorry, but...

38
00:05:23,533 --> 00:05:26,116
(Phil gasping)

39
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:30,773
- He's dead.

40
00:05:33,310 --> 00:05:35,140
Ling Su just died as well.

41
00:05:38,738 --> 00:05:39,821
- This sucks.

42
00:05:40,756 --> 00:05:43,506
(dramatic music)

43
00:05:50,203 --> 00:05:51,114
Butch, come.

44
00:05:51,114 --> 00:05:53,781
(Butch panting)

45
00:05:56,662 --> 00:05:59,727
- "I will ransom them from
the power of the grave.

46
00:05:59,727 --> 00:06:01,773
"I will redeem them from death.

47
00:06:02,866 --> 00:06:05,617
"O death, I will be thy plague.

48
00:06:05,617 --> 00:06:08,523
"O grave, I will be thy destruction.

49
00:06:09,605 --> 00:06:13,290
"And he stood between
the dead and the living,

50
00:06:13,290 --> 00:06:15,397
"and the plague was stayed."

51
00:06:17,150 --> 00:06:18,047
Amen.

52
00:06:18,047 --> 00:06:18,943
- [All] Amen.

53
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:21,233
- Dewitt?

54
00:06:24,857 --> 00:06:27,372
(electronic beeping)

55
00:06:27,372 --> 00:06:30,277
(door whirring)

56
00:06:30,277 --> 00:06:33,027
(dramatic music)

57
00:06:44,426 --> 00:06:47,509
(electronic beeping)

58
00:06:49,489 --> 00:06:52,656
(electronic warbling)

59
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:00,794
Why don't we all take some time

60
00:07:00,794 --> 00:07:02,290
to think about our options here?

61
00:07:02,290 --> 00:07:03,530
- Time?

62
00:07:03,530 --> 00:07:05,250
We're out of time!

63
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:07,540
If we don't send a crew
topside for raw materials,

64
00:07:07,540 --> 00:07:08,373
we're dead!

65
00:07:08,373 --> 00:07:10,490
- We've been out of vaccine for five days.

66
00:07:10,490 --> 00:07:11,973
We need those materials, Von.

67
00:07:11,973 --> 00:07:13,920
- [Kyle] Come on Kara,
tell it to us straight.

68
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:16,600
- The virus randomly
attacks the immune system.

69
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:19,970
There is no way of predicting
who is most susceptible.

70
00:07:19,970 --> 00:07:22,920
It could happen at any day, at any time,

71
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:24,223
to any one of us.

72
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:27,730
- So what's everybody lookin' at?

73
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:30,360
I'm sick, all right?

74
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:31,820
What do you want me to do?

75
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:32,740
You heard her!

76
00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:35,190
So don't look at me like I'm
some kind of goddamn leper.

77
00:07:35,190 --> 00:07:36,680
- Ernie, nobody thinks that.

78
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:37,640
- Bullshit!

79
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:40,300
Maybe David Pennington will
survive and get back here,

80
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:41,940
but I can't sit around here and wait.

81
00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:42,960
I'm goin' up there!

82
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:45,060
- All right, let's deal with it.

83
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:47,480
Kyle, you and Ernie take Sharon topside

84
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:48,560
and comb the northern shelf,

85
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:49,540
then get back here.

86
00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:50,373
- Kyle, no.

87
00:07:50,373 --> 00:07:51,206
- It's all right.

88
00:07:51,206 --> 00:07:53,370
- I don't recall putting it up for a vote!

89
00:07:53,370 --> 00:07:55,380
We'll maintain radio contact.

90
00:07:55,380 --> 00:07:57,160
Any Lusus sightings, you three,

91
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:59,133
get your butts back immediately!

92
00:08:00,113 --> 00:08:01,696
- Kyle, be careful.

93
00:08:02,605 --> 00:08:05,355
(dramatic music)

94
00:08:06,592 --> 00:08:09,425
(beastly growing)

95
00:08:13,913 --> 00:08:16,496
(both panting)

96
00:08:21,992 --> 00:08:25,159
(electronic whirring)

97
00:08:32,729 --> 00:08:34,157
(both grunting)

98
00:08:34,157 --> 00:08:36,990
(beastly growing)

99
00:08:50,349 --> 00:08:51,849
- Ah!

100
00:08:51,849 --> 00:08:53,985
(Aaron groaning)

101
00:08:53,985 --> 00:08:56,818
(beastly growing)

102
00:09:04,304 --> 00:09:05,637
- [Ariel] Aaron!

103
00:09:09,837 --> 00:09:13,420
(Ariel and Aaron groaning)

104
00:09:19,070 --> 00:09:19,933
Can you walk on it?

105
00:09:19,933 --> 00:09:20,766
- Don't!

106
00:09:21,791 --> 00:09:23,176
I don't know.

107
00:09:23,176 --> 00:09:25,085
- [Ariel] I'll help you.

108
00:09:25,085 --> 00:09:26,335
Come on, hurry!

109
00:09:33,584 --> 00:09:36,251
(both groaning)

110
00:09:43,123 --> 00:09:46,090
- I can't go any farther, save yourself!

111
00:09:46,090 --> 00:09:48,213
- [Ariel] I'm not leaving you, come on!

112
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:56,583
(beastly growing)

113
00:09:58,714 --> 00:09:59,547
Hide!

114
00:10:07,290 --> 00:10:10,043
(Ariel groaning)

115
00:10:10,043 --> 00:10:11,960
- Take me, you bastard!

116
00:10:13,450 --> 00:10:16,283
(beastly growing)

117
00:10:17,806 --> 00:10:19,699
(Butch barking)

118
00:10:19,699 --> 00:10:24,699
(arrow firing)
(beastly screeching)

119
00:10:31,936 --> 00:10:34,519
(somber music)

120
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,343
Take care of her...

121
00:10:38,203 --> 00:10:40,036
Take care of Ariel.

122
00:10:40,036 --> 00:10:42,839
Promise me!

123
00:10:42,839 --> 00:10:43,756
Promise me!

124
00:10:45,039 --> 00:10:48,089
She's my sister, take care of her.

125
00:10:48,089 --> 00:10:49,756
- [David] I promise.

126
00:11:06,282 --> 00:11:08,164
- [Ariel] Where, where's Aaron?

127
00:11:08,164 --> 00:11:09,831
- [David] He's dead.

128
00:11:11,047 --> 00:11:12,591
- No!

129
00:11:12,591 --> 00:11:13,424
No, no!

130
00:11:14,558 --> 00:11:16,240
- He made me promise I'd take care of you.

131
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:18,237
We can't stay here, it'll
be back soon with others.

132
00:11:18,237 --> 00:11:20,563
- Oh, he's my brother, I can't leave him!

133
00:11:21,810 --> 00:11:23,420
He was all I had left.

134
00:11:23,420 --> 00:11:25,010
- We've gotta go now.

135
00:11:25,010 --> 00:11:25,843
Come on.

136
00:11:28,570 --> 00:11:29,640
- Kyle, this is Von.

137
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:30,523
Come in, over.

138
00:11:34,028 --> 00:11:35,528
- I gotta rest a minute, guys.

139
00:11:36,441 --> 00:11:37,883
- Kyle, this is Von, over.

140
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Kyle, this is Von.

141
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:40,883
Come in, over.

142
00:11:41,990 --> 00:11:43,460
- Yeah, Von.

143
00:11:43,460 --> 00:11:44,890
- What's your location, Kyle?

144
00:11:44,890 --> 00:11:45,723
Over.

145
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:49,985
- Somewhere between very
tense and scared shitless.

146
00:11:49,985 --> 00:11:52,100
- Any luck with surrounding plant life?

147
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:52,933
Over.

148
00:11:52,933 --> 00:11:53,900
- Negative.

149
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:55,340
I'll be in touch when we do.

150
00:11:55,340 --> 00:11:56,490
- [Von] Keep me posted.

151
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:01,300
- [Kyle] Where you goin'?

152
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:03,670
- I'm, I'm goin' up there
to get a better look around.

153
00:12:03,670 --> 00:12:05,050
- I don't think we should separate.

154
00:12:05,050 --> 00:12:06,690
- Why don't you worry about him?

155
00:12:06,690 --> 00:12:07,953
- Stay in sight, okay?

156
00:12:13,158 --> 00:12:14,020
(Ernie coughing)

157
00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:15,640
- I gotta get out of this sun.

158
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:18,233
Feels like my insides are on fire.

159
00:12:18,233 --> 00:12:19,370
- There's a cave over there.

160
00:12:19,370 --> 00:12:21,420
You can cool down until Sharon gets back.

161
00:12:23,733 --> 00:12:26,483
(dramatic music)

162
00:12:38,151 --> 00:12:40,234
Looks clear, you're good.

163
00:12:51,923 --> 00:12:53,707
How you doin'?

164
00:12:53,707 --> 00:12:55,731
- I'm scared, man.

165
00:12:55,731 --> 00:12:57,635
- Hang in there.

166
00:12:57,635 --> 00:12:59,107
We'll find something soon.

167
00:12:59,107 --> 00:13:01,774
(Ernie gagging)

168
00:13:22,895 --> 00:13:27,395
(Ernie gagging and breathing heavily)

169
00:13:37,971 --> 00:13:40,116
(beastly growling)
(Ernie groaning)

170
00:13:40,116 --> 00:13:42,533
(gun firing)

171
00:13:44,071 --> 00:13:44,904
- Kyle!

172
00:13:44,904 --> 00:13:48,931
(gun firing)
(beastly growling)

173
00:13:48,931 --> 00:13:51,598
(Kyle groaning)

174
00:13:53,170 --> 00:13:54,019
(static buzzing)

175
00:13:54,019 --> 00:13:57,231
- What was that?

176
00:13:57,231 --> 00:13:58,699
- Kyle, please respond.

177
00:13:58,699 --> 00:14:03,699
(beastly growing)
(Kyle groaning)

178
00:14:13,783 --> 00:14:14,707
- [Kyle] Ah!

179
00:14:14,707 --> 00:14:16,227
- Kyle's in trouble, I know it!

180
00:14:16,227 --> 00:14:17,630
- You don't know that.

181
00:14:17,630 --> 00:14:20,114
Any number of things could
cause radio interference.

182
00:14:20,114 --> 00:14:22,947
(beastly growing)

183
00:14:23,862 --> 00:14:24,779
- Heads up!

184
00:14:26,954 --> 00:14:28,548
(Sharon grunting)

185
00:14:28,548 --> 00:14:31,548
(beastly shrieking)

186
00:14:39,164 --> 00:14:40,433
You all right?

187
00:14:40,433 --> 00:14:41,770
- Yeah.

188
00:14:41,770 --> 00:14:43,250
- Where's Ernie?

189
00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:44,103
- He's dead.

190
00:14:45,090 --> 00:14:46,610
- Kyle, is everything all right?

191
00:14:46,610 --> 00:14:47,653
Please respond!

192
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:54,800
- We don't have a radio
now, so what do we do?

193
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:56,050
- We'll never make it back before dark.

194
00:14:56,050 --> 00:14:58,003
We're gonna have to find
a safe place to camp.

195
00:14:58,958 --> 00:14:59,791
- So what are you doing?

196
00:14:59,791 --> 00:15:01,390
Let's go!
- He was a friend of ours!

197
00:15:01,390 --> 00:15:02,860
Don't you care about anything?

198
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:03,990
- Well, it's better that
he should go like this

199
00:15:03,990 --> 00:15:05,120
than by the plague.

200
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:07,050
It's a nasty way to die.

201
00:15:07,050 --> 00:15:08,900
- You're completely cold, aren't you?

202
00:15:09,890 --> 00:15:11,610
- Oh, not like Robin, huh?

203
00:15:11,610 --> 00:15:12,810
You'll get tired of her.

204
00:15:22,112 --> 00:15:24,862
(dramatic music)

205
00:15:29,114 --> 00:15:31,197
- This is where we lived.

206
00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:33,493
- Wait here.

207
00:15:54,980 --> 00:15:55,813
It's safe.

208
00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:04,840
We'll take the solar
charger and canned goods,

209
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:07,280
anything else that's
light enough to carry.

210
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:08,880
Do you have a pack of some kind?

211
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:10,042
- [Ariel] Over there.

212
00:16:10,042 --> 00:16:12,992
- All right, we'll camp here
tonight, move out after sunup.

213
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:20,233
- Any news?

214
00:16:22,180 --> 00:16:23,013
- Nothing.

215
00:16:25,530 --> 00:16:27,790
Oh God, Dewitt, you think they're okay?

216
00:16:27,790 --> 00:16:29,230
- Hey, don't you worry.

217
00:16:29,230 --> 00:16:31,100
They'll be back tomorrow afternoon,

218
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:33,860
our my name ain't Dewitt Thompson.

219
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:35,230
- I hope you're right.

220
00:16:35,230 --> 00:16:36,140
- Well, I know I'm right.

221
00:16:36,140 --> 00:16:38,146
I got a birth certificate to prove it.

222
00:16:38,146 --> 00:16:40,979
(Dewitt laughing)

223
00:16:42,730 --> 00:16:44,810
Here, have a little nip of this.

224
00:16:44,810 --> 00:16:46,560
It'll take the edge off of waitin'.

225
00:16:50,698 --> 00:16:52,747
(Robin coughing)

226
00:16:52,747 --> 00:16:54,008
(Dewitt laughing)

227
00:16:54,008 --> 00:16:56,147
Well, was I right?

228
00:16:56,147 --> 00:16:57,107
I told ya!

229
00:16:57,107 --> 00:16:57,940
- Uh huh.

230
00:17:03,974 --> 00:17:06,724
(fire crackling)

231
00:17:10,362 --> 00:17:12,945
(somber music)

232
00:17:16,190 --> 00:17:18,190
- Is that your brother and your parents?

233
00:17:19,290 --> 00:17:20,123
- Yes.

234
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:22,703
- [David] They die of the plague?

235
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:26,043
Look, I'm sorry.

236
00:17:33,090 --> 00:17:34,390
- Where did you come from?

237
00:17:35,770 --> 00:17:36,830
- I was with a group of scientists

238
00:17:36,830 --> 00:17:39,370
based in an underground lab in the Mojave.

239
00:17:39,370 --> 00:17:41,270
Until our crew was wiped out by Lusus.

240
00:17:42,115 --> 00:17:42,948
- Lusus?

241
00:17:44,398 --> 00:17:46,070
Is that what you call them?

242
00:17:46,070 --> 00:17:47,630
- It's Latin.

243
00:17:47,630 --> 00:17:49,450
It means a freak of nature.

244
00:17:49,450 --> 00:17:51,350
- Where are you taking me?

245
00:17:51,350 --> 00:17:53,193
- Northeast, to the Rockies.

246
00:17:54,902 --> 00:17:57,423
Got a sister lab with other
scientists like myself.

247
00:17:59,270 --> 00:18:00,320
You'll be safe there.

248
00:18:03,779 --> 00:18:04,870
Why don't you get some sleep?

249
00:18:04,870 --> 00:18:06,720
We've got a long journey ahead of us.

250
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:15,993
- Thank you.

251
00:18:19,070 --> 00:18:19,903
- David.

252
00:18:21,447 --> 00:18:22,280
- David.

253
00:19:31,390 --> 00:19:33,190
- We can't go back empty-handed.

254
00:19:33,190 --> 00:19:34,023
- You heard Von.

255
00:19:35,210 --> 00:19:36,670
Our time's up.

256
00:19:36,670 --> 00:19:38,578
Besides, we're out of radio communication.

257
00:19:38,578 --> 00:19:40,285
- Yeah, then what do we do?

258
00:19:40,285 --> 00:19:42,549
(faint beastly growing)

259
00:19:42,549 --> 00:19:44,799
- Get the hell out of here.

260
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:51,320
- Did anyone else from
your lab crew survive?

261
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:53,410
- Another scientist, Linda.

262
00:19:53,410 --> 00:19:54,243
- Well, where is she?

263
00:19:54,243 --> 00:19:55,076
Is she still alive?

264
00:19:55,992 --> 00:19:57,397
- No.

265
00:19:57,397 --> 00:19:59,690
She was killed out in the desert.

266
00:19:59,690 --> 00:20:00,553
- I'm sorry.

267
00:20:21,224 --> 00:20:22,457
(arrow firing)

268
00:20:22,457 --> 00:20:25,374
(rocks clattering)

269
00:20:35,466 --> 00:20:38,216
(static buzzing)

270
00:20:39,586 --> 00:20:41,420
- This is David Pennington
to Rocky Mountain Lab,

271
00:20:41,420 --> 00:20:44,320
listening 145.5, over.

272
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:45,620
- This is Rocky Mountain Lab.

273
00:20:45,620 --> 00:20:47,050
Come in David, are you all right?

274
00:20:47,050 --> 00:20:47,883
Over.

275
00:20:47,883 --> 00:20:49,160
- Just fine, Von.

276
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:51,230
Found a transportable power source.

277
00:20:51,230 --> 00:20:52,510
Won't last long though.

278
00:20:52,510 --> 00:20:53,343
And how are things there?

279
00:20:53,343 --> 00:20:54,790
Over.
- Uh, not very good.

280
00:20:54,790 --> 00:20:57,130
Our vaccine's history.

281
00:20:57,130 --> 00:21:00,330
My people are startin' to
show heavy signs of infection.

282
00:21:00,330 --> 00:21:03,530
- I got a pretty large supply
of base materials in my pack.

283
00:21:03,530 --> 00:21:05,330
I'm only missing elemental
strychnine, over.

284
00:21:05,330 --> 00:21:07,670
- Well, we've got two more dead here

285
00:21:07,670 --> 00:21:09,240
and three missing topside.

286
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:10,460
We need you, David.

287
00:21:10,460 --> 00:21:12,520
As soon as you can get here, over.

288
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:13,970
- I'm on course, Von.

289
00:21:13,970 --> 00:21:15,480
Just hang in there.

290
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:16,560
Over and out.

291
00:21:18,622 --> 00:21:19,836
(alarm beeping)

292
00:21:19,836 --> 00:21:21,653
- Hey, Von, check this out.

293
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:24,302
They made it.

294
00:21:24,302 --> 00:21:26,150
(dramatic music)

295
00:21:26,150 --> 00:21:26,983
- Wait a minute.

296
00:21:28,130 --> 00:21:29,746
Where the hell is Ernie?

297
00:21:29,746 --> 00:21:31,890
(alarm blaring)

298
00:21:31,890 --> 00:21:32,723
- What was that?

299
00:21:39,433 --> 00:21:40,393
Holy shit!

300
00:21:41,517 --> 00:21:43,434
One of them's up there!

301
00:21:49,577 --> 00:21:53,849
Robin, Dewitt, get up
to the control room now!

302
00:21:53,849 --> 00:21:58,849
(beastly growing)
(Sharon screaming)

303
00:21:59,056 --> 00:22:01,473
(gun firing)

304
00:22:07,163 --> 00:22:09,080
- You all right?
- Yeah!

305
00:22:10,952 --> 00:22:13,015
(gun firing)

306
00:22:13,015 --> 00:22:14,015
- Get below!

307
00:22:16,114 --> 00:22:17,411
Go, go, go!

308
00:22:17,411 --> 00:22:18,971
- There's the stairs!

309
00:22:18,971 --> 00:22:20,298
(gun firing)

310
00:22:20,298 --> 00:22:21,981
(Sharon groaning)

311
00:22:21,981 --> 00:22:24,715
(gun firing)

312
00:22:24,715 --> 00:22:25,548
- Sharon!

313
00:22:26,607 --> 00:22:28,091
- [Sharon] I'm okay.

314
00:22:28,091 --> 00:22:30,508
(gun firing)

315
00:22:31,463 --> 00:22:34,662
(Kyle groaning)

316
00:22:34,662 --> 00:22:35,495
- Kyle!

317
00:22:36,575 --> 00:22:37,825
- I'm goin' up!

318
00:22:39,326 --> 00:22:42,326
- Where's Ernie?
- He didn't make it.

319
00:22:45,022 --> 00:22:48,603
- [Kyle] Close the fuckin' hatch!

320
00:22:48,603 --> 00:22:51,436
(beastly growing)

321
00:22:55,970 --> 00:22:57,233
(Sharon screaming)

322
00:22:57,233 --> 00:22:58,802
- Look at that thing!

323
00:22:58,802 --> 00:23:00,519
- Can we get below, please?

324
00:23:00,519 --> 00:23:05,519
(loud thumping)
(beastly screeching)

325
00:23:10,016 --> 00:23:11,650
- Kyle, are you okay?

326
00:23:11,650 --> 00:23:15,527
- He just had the wind
knocked out of him, come on!

327
00:23:15,527 --> 00:23:20,527
(loud thumping)
(dramatic music)

328
00:23:34,180 --> 00:23:36,577
- Here, put this around you.

329
00:23:39,390 --> 00:23:40,223
- But you'll be cold.

330
00:23:40,223 --> 00:23:41,413
- That's okay, I'm fine.

331
00:23:43,795 --> 00:23:45,153
- What's the matter?
- Nothing.

332
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:48,133
I'm just not used to being around a woman.

333
00:23:49,239 --> 00:23:50,072
- Hey...

334
00:23:53,420 --> 00:23:55,590
- I've changed so much.

335
00:23:55,590 --> 00:23:56,940
- David...
- I'm shut off.

336
00:23:59,710 --> 00:24:00,543
- Look at me.

337
00:24:04,237 --> 00:24:05,070
It's okay.

338
00:24:06,699 --> 00:24:07,549
I'm shut off too.

339
00:24:09,955 --> 00:24:11,380
But you know what?

340
00:24:11,380 --> 00:24:14,030
There's nothing wrong with
people needing each other.

341
00:24:14,875 --> 00:24:15,773
It's okay.

342
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:17,993
I need you.

343
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:21,573
We need each other.

344
00:24:23,030 --> 00:24:24,857
And there's nothing wrong with that.

345
00:24:26,543 --> 00:24:29,293
(dramatic music)

346
00:25:39,056 --> 00:25:40,200
(Robin gasping)

347
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:41,690
- Oh my God!

348
00:25:41,690 --> 00:25:43,407
You practically scared me to death.

349
00:25:43,407 --> 00:25:44,680
- I'm sorry.

350
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:45,780
- Take a look at this.

351
00:25:47,220 --> 00:25:49,020
- Wow, what is it?

352
00:25:49,020 --> 00:25:50,690
- It's a sample from the dead finger,

353
00:25:50,690 --> 00:25:52,390
only it's not a dead finger.

354
00:25:52,390 --> 00:25:55,060
There's still active
cell life happening here.

355
00:25:55,060 --> 00:25:58,020
- Well, whatever it is,
it's going to have to wait

356
00:25:58,020 --> 00:26:00,887
because Von wants us down
in the mess hall pronto.

357
00:26:03,580 --> 00:26:04,413
Eesh!

358
00:26:06,007 --> 00:26:09,979
(Kyle vocalizing)
(Robin laughing)

359
00:26:09,979 --> 00:26:14,979
(wet squishing)
(heart beating)

360
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:24,440
- Well, now that we're all here,

361
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:26,290
let's get right down to it.

362
00:26:26,290 --> 00:26:28,890
I've got something that you
all should be interested in.

363
00:26:28,890 --> 00:26:31,050
David Pennington has made contact.

364
00:26:31,050 --> 00:26:32,770
- Oh!
- All right!

365
00:26:32,770 --> 00:26:35,070
- He's on his way here
now with raw materials.

366
00:26:35,070 --> 00:26:36,243
- Thank God!

367
00:26:37,770 --> 00:26:39,500
- We're down to one camera topside.

368
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:41,030
We have limited visibility.

369
00:26:41,030 --> 00:26:42,860
Now even if David does get here,

370
00:26:42,860 --> 00:26:44,593
he's gonna have to make it past the Lusus.

371
00:26:44,593 --> 00:26:46,370
- This is bullshit.

372
00:26:46,370 --> 00:26:48,450
This guy's not gonna
show, and even if he does,

373
00:26:48,450 --> 00:26:50,350
those things up there are
gonna eat him for breakfast.

374
00:26:50,350 --> 00:26:52,410
- I'm sure as hell glad
you're not in charge

375
00:26:52,410 --> 00:26:54,284
of morale around here, Jamie.

376
00:26:54,284 --> 00:26:57,451
(light country music)

377
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:02,460
The name of the game
around here is survival.

378
00:27:02,460 --> 00:27:05,780
And if we don't all start
pullin' together, boys and girls,

379
00:27:05,780 --> 00:27:08,950
none of us are gonna make it,
and it's as simple as that.

380
00:27:12,184 --> 00:27:17,184
(wet squishing)
(heart beating)

381
00:27:20,093 --> 00:27:20,926
(light rock music)

382
00:27:20,926 --> 00:27:24,178

383
00:27:24,178 --> 00:27:27,747

(pestle clinking)

392
00:28:13,137 --> 00:28:14,667
- What the hell are you doing?

393
00:28:14,667 --> 00:28:15,873
- [Sharon] How did you get in here?

394
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:20,650
Well at least I hope you
closed the goddamn door.

395
00:28:23,290 --> 00:28:24,240
- What is all this?

396
00:28:25,316 --> 00:28:27,430
- I found it topside, all right?

397
00:28:27,430 --> 00:28:30,290
It's obviously the stuff
Phil dropped before he died.

398
00:28:30,290 --> 00:28:31,490
- [Jamie] To make vaccine?

399
00:28:31,490 --> 00:28:32,323
- Yes.

400
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:36,890
Only there's not enough
for the whole crew.

401
00:28:36,890 --> 00:28:39,999
Maybe two people, max.

402
00:28:39,999 --> 00:28:42,720
♪ She's dancing on your back ♪

403
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:44,820

404
00:28:47,291 --> 00:28:48,291
It's for us.

405
00:28:51,271 --> 00:28:52,771
- Come here, baby.

406
00:29:04,860 --> 00:29:08,443
(Sharon and Jamie moaning)

407
00:29:40,826 --> 00:29:44,327
(tool clattering)

408
00:29:44,327 --> 00:29:45,160
- What was that?

409
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:46,660
I heard something.

410
00:29:48,151 --> 00:29:50,151
- I don't hear anything.

411
00:29:53,412 --> 00:29:56,240
- Maybe I'm just being paranoid.

412
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:58,430
- Does anybody else
know about the vaccine?

413
00:29:58,430 --> 00:30:00,660
'Cause if they did, they'd kill us.

414
00:30:00,660 --> 00:30:02,283
- Nobody's gonna find out.

415
00:30:04,020 --> 00:30:06,083
Unless you scream it out in your sleep.

416
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:09,253
Or now.

417
00:30:13,795 --> 00:30:16,031
(Sharon moaning loudly)

418
00:30:16,031 --> 00:30:16,864
- Ooh.

419
00:30:22,820 --> 00:30:27,820
(wet squishing)
(heart beating)

420
00:30:40,929 --> 00:30:43,929
- All right, let's go down that way.

421
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:48,580
What, why are you smiling?

422
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:51,593
- I'm pregnant.

423
00:30:53,150 --> 00:30:54,640
- You're what?

424
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:55,683
That's impossible.

425
00:30:56,900 --> 00:30:59,423
- I just know it, it's inside me.

426
00:31:01,090 --> 00:31:04,400
- Look, even if you were,
it's way too early to tell.

427
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:05,603
- I can't explain it.

428
00:31:06,930 --> 00:31:08,530
I just feel it.

429
00:31:08,530 --> 00:31:10,520
- When we get to the lab,
there's a whole team of doctors

430
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:12,270
and scientists that'll examine you.

431
00:31:14,140 --> 00:31:18,930
We'll see, I guess.

432
00:31:18,930 --> 00:31:20,300
- I guess we will.

433
00:31:35,030 --> 00:31:36,020
- Let's rest here.

434
00:31:39,648 --> 00:31:42,648
(machete whooshing)

435
00:31:59,568 --> 00:32:00,401
Here.

436
00:32:00,401 --> 00:32:01,300
- What's that for?

437
00:32:01,300 --> 00:32:02,720
- Save the pulp.

438
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:04,780
We can chew it later for moisture.

439
00:32:04,780 --> 00:32:07,680
I'm gonna cut another,
I want you to start.

440
00:32:23,070 --> 00:32:23,903
- David, no!

441
00:32:24,790 --> 00:32:26,340
Don't touch it, just walk away!

442
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:28,553
- What's wrong?

443
00:32:29,712 --> 00:32:30,860
(David laughing)

444
00:32:30,860 --> 00:32:31,910
What's wrong?

445
00:32:31,910 --> 00:32:35,320
- Poisonous tarantulas
breed in these cactus.

446
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:37,543
If you see it moving, stay away.

447
00:32:44,950 --> 00:32:45,783
- Down, down!

448
00:32:51,237 --> 00:32:53,921
(electronic whirring)

449
00:32:53,921 --> 00:32:55,004
- What is it?

450
00:33:00,450 --> 00:33:01,450
A scavenger.

451
00:33:02,350 --> 00:33:03,183
- Let's go.

452
00:33:07,210 --> 00:33:08,920
- Why do we have to make contact?

453
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:10,130
These men are barbarians.

454
00:33:10,130 --> 00:33:11,590
- We've got a whole
lab crew counting on me

455
00:33:11,590 --> 00:33:13,830
to bring raw materials for vaccine.

456
00:33:13,830 --> 00:33:15,730
I don't know the area and I need help.

457
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:20,193
Come on.

458
00:33:25,982 --> 00:33:28,482
(Bo groaning)

459
00:33:29,670 --> 00:33:30,503
- Shit!

460
00:33:31,518 --> 00:33:33,050
You scared me.

461
00:33:33,050 --> 00:33:34,050
I heard you comin',

462
00:33:34,050 --> 00:33:36,142
I thought you was one
of them damn mutations.

463
00:33:36,142 --> 00:33:37,730
(laughing)

464
00:33:37,730 --> 00:33:39,403
I'm mighty glad you-you're not.

465
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:42,713
The name's Bo.

466
00:33:48,410 --> 00:33:49,243
- I'm David.

467
00:33:50,789 --> 00:33:52,289
This is Ariel, and that's Butch.

468
00:33:52,289 --> 00:33:54,956
(Butch panting)

469
00:33:56,070 --> 00:33:58,490
- We don't often see other survivors.

470
00:33:58,490 --> 00:34:00,690
- Maybe you can help me, I'm uh,

471
00:34:00,690 --> 00:34:03,270
I'm looking for a particular
species of cactus,

472
00:34:03,270 --> 00:34:04,869
Lophophora williamsii.

473
00:34:04,869 --> 00:34:06,260
- Huh?

474
00:34:06,260 --> 00:34:09,130
- Uh, it's also known
as peyote or mescaline.

475
00:34:09,130 --> 00:34:10,223
- Oh, yeah!

476
00:34:11,067 --> 00:34:14,473
Um, my clan uses it for
religious ceremonies.

477
00:34:15,590 --> 00:34:18,143
My leader knows where it, where it grows.

478
00:34:20,680 --> 00:34:23,220
Just, you don't look
like the religious type.

479
00:34:23,220 --> 00:34:24,690
- Actually I need the strychnine filaments

480
00:34:24,690 --> 00:34:26,290
found in the buds of the cactus.

481
00:34:27,910 --> 00:34:28,843
- Well, whatever.

482
00:34:29,810 --> 00:34:31,650
Why don't you camp with us tonight,

483
00:34:31,650 --> 00:34:35,350
and we'll find you that
cactus first thing come sunup?

484
00:34:35,350 --> 00:34:37,320
- I'd appreciate that very much.

485
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:38,800
- Great.

486
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:39,633
Well...

487
00:34:41,530 --> 00:34:43,070
Let's get on with it.

488
00:34:43,070 --> 00:34:46,503
We don't want to be
here once the sun drops.

489
00:34:52,020 --> 00:34:53,670
- Well?

490
00:34:53,670 --> 00:34:54,830
- He's nice.

491
00:34:54,830 --> 00:34:56,293
Weird, but nice.

492
00:35:01,086 --> 00:35:04,169
(vultures squawking)

493
00:35:06,483 --> 00:35:11,483
(clan people laughing
and conversing quietly)

494
00:35:12,422 --> 00:35:15,339
(mysterious music)

495
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:38,340
- These are our guests, David, and Ariel.

496
00:35:38,340 --> 00:35:40,010
- You have come at last.

497
00:35:40,010 --> 00:35:42,010
The prophecy has been fulfilled.

498
00:35:42,010 --> 00:35:46,150
Three nights ago, I had a
vision, and now you are here.

499
00:35:46,150 --> 00:35:48,970
I am Elaba, leader of our small clan.

500
00:35:48,970 --> 00:35:51,060
You have come for medicine, have you not?

501
00:35:51,060 --> 00:35:52,300
- How did you know that?

502
00:35:52,300 --> 00:35:53,633
- I know many things.

503
00:35:55,890 --> 00:35:58,080
Let us prepare you food and drink.

504
00:35:58,080 --> 00:36:01,290
And tomorrow, I will have my
men show you what you seek.

505
00:36:01,290 --> 00:36:04,567
Shantille, Moncita, prepare
a place for our guests.

506
00:36:10,607 --> 00:36:11,440
(loud thumping)
- Oh!

507
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:13,213
Don't those things ever sleep?

508
00:36:14,402 --> 00:36:15,235
(Von chuckling)

509
00:36:15,235 --> 00:36:18,926
- Their primal needs obviously
outweigh exhaustion and pain.

510
00:36:18,926 --> 00:36:19,759
(Kara sighing)

511
00:36:19,759 --> 00:36:21,060
- Why don't you go get some sleep?

512
00:36:21,060 --> 00:36:23,722
I'll stand watch down here for a while.

513
00:36:23,722 --> 00:36:25,572
- You know I can't sleep without you.

514
00:36:32,106 --> 00:36:32,939
- Robin?

515
00:36:37,970 --> 00:36:38,803
Robin?

516
00:36:42,123 --> 00:36:45,400
(Robin coughing)

517
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:46,233
Robin?

518
00:36:47,706 --> 00:36:51,546
(Robin breathing heavily)

519
00:36:51,546 --> 00:36:52,629
- I'm sick...

520
00:36:54,126 --> 00:36:55,566
I'm sick.

521
00:36:55,566 --> 00:36:57,733
(sobbing)

522
00:36:58,894 --> 00:37:01,561
(Robin gagging)

523
00:37:02,506 --> 00:37:05,445
(loud thumping)

524
00:37:05,445 --> 00:37:07,095
(alarm blaring)

525
00:37:07,095 --> 00:37:10,260
- They just knocked out our last camera.

526
00:37:10,260 --> 00:37:13,128
(wet squishing)
(heart beating)

527
00:37:13,128 --> 00:37:13,961
(Ariel sighing)

528
00:37:13,961 --> 00:37:15,110
- [Ariel] David, I really hate it here.

529
00:37:15,110 --> 00:37:16,270
When can we leave?

530
00:37:16,270 --> 00:37:19,322
- As soon as I get what I
need tomorrow, we're going.

531
00:37:19,322 --> 00:37:21,406
- [Clan Woman] I can't, I've
gotta take this over to--

532
00:37:21,406 --> 00:37:23,630
- Now, come here.

533
00:37:23,630 --> 00:37:24,463
- No.

534
00:37:25,786 --> 00:37:26,953
You come here.

535
00:37:34,602 --> 00:37:36,685
- You have done well, Bo.

536
00:37:37,617 --> 00:37:41,520
- The man and the woman,
they want to move on.

537
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:43,020
- I know.

538
00:37:43,020 --> 00:37:44,550
We must do it tomorrow.

539
00:37:44,550 --> 00:37:45,713
She is with child.

540
00:37:46,630 --> 00:37:48,660
Very early stages.

541
00:37:48,660 --> 00:37:50,520
The fetus is not yet formed.

542
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:51,763
We must move quickly.

543
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:01,710
- Psst, David.

544
00:38:01,710 --> 00:38:02,543
It's morning.

545
00:38:12,770 --> 00:38:13,603
- Just rest.

546
00:38:14,946 --> 00:38:16,236
I'll be back soon.

547
00:38:16,236 --> 00:38:20,319
(clan people conversing quietly)

548
00:38:37,420 --> 00:38:38,370
- Let's get moving.

549
00:38:49,043 --> 00:38:51,670
(dramatic music)

550
00:38:51,670 --> 00:38:54,468
- What do you want?
(Butch barking)

551
00:38:54,468 --> 00:38:55,301
- Do it.

552
00:38:57,860 --> 00:38:59,182
- No!

553
00:38:59,182 --> 00:39:01,232
(Butch whining)
Butch!

554
00:39:01,232 --> 00:39:02,771
Oh no!

555
00:39:02,771 --> 00:39:03,771
- Bring her!

556
00:39:04,870 --> 00:39:06,175
- [Ariel] No!

557
00:39:06,175 --> 00:39:08,842
(Butch whining)

558
00:39:14,020 --> 00:39:16,290
- [David] So how's your
group survive the plague?

559
00:39:16,290 --> 00:39:17,240
- Don't know.

560
00:39:17,240 --> 00:39:19,350
Some get it, some don't.

561
00:39:19,350 --> 00:39:20,603
No rhyme or reason.

562
00:39:22,380 --> 00:39:25,383
We make sure when they go, they go happy.

563
00:39:29,420 --> 00:39:30,520
That's where it grows.

564
00:39:33,056 --> 00:39:36,130
(electronic whirring)

565
00:39:36,130 --> 00:39:36,963
- Great.

566
00:39:40,632 --> 00:39:43,382
(dramatic music)

567
00:39:45,380 --> 00:39:46,563
This shouldn't take long.

568
00:40:14,750 --> 00:40:17,500
(David groaning)

569
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:24,780
- Crush his skull, Bo!

570
00:40:24,780 --> 00:40:25,613
Finish him off!

571
00:40:26,781 --> 00:40:29,198
(Bo yelling)

572
00:40:31,005 --> 00:40:34,255
(Bo and Rafe groaning)

573
00:40:47,143 --> 00:40:49,060
- You're mine now, boy!

574
00:41:03,516 --> 00:41:06,183
(both grunting)

575
00:41:18,216 --> 00:41:19,878
(Rafe yelling)

576
00:41:19,878 --> 00:41:22,628
(Rafe screaming)

577
00:41:37,660 --> 00:41:39,676
(dramatic music)

578
00:41:39,676 --> 00:41:42,426
(Ariel groaning)

579
00:41:45,806 --> 00:41:47,570
- David, where's David?

580
00:41:47,570 --> 00:41:48,870
What have you done to him?

581
00:41:49,987 --> 00:41:52,680
- You have been sent to us for a purpose.

582
00:41:52,680 --> 00:41:54,760
The creatures grow restless.

583
00:41:54,760 --> 00:41:56,370
We must sacrifice...

584
00:41:57,210 --> 00:41:59,297
Lest they take one of the clan.

585
00:42:04,107 --> 00:42:06,524
- [Ariel] What are you doing?

586
00:42:08,515 --> 00:42:09,348
No!

587
00:42:11,314 --> 00:42:12,891
Let me go!

588
00:42:12,891 --> 00:42:15,641
(Ariel groaning)

589
00:42:19,131 --> 00:42:19,964
Ow, oh!

590
00:42:27,741 --> 00:42:30,273
Ow, you're hurting me!

591
00:42:30,273 --> 00:42:31,106
Let me go!

592
00:42:32,629 --> 00:42:34,264
Why, why are you doing this to me?

593
00:42:34,264 --> 00:42:38,681
(Elaba chanting in foreign language)

594
00:42:45,486 --> 00:42:46,736
Please, please!

595
00:42:48,298 --> 00:42:52,887
(horn blowing)
Please let me go!

596
00:42:52,887 --> 00:42:53,970
- It is done.

597
00:42:55,767 --> 00:42:57,258
- [Ariel] Wait!

598
00:42:57,258 --> 00:42:58,925
Where are you going?

599
00:43:00,342 --> 00:43:02,009
Don't leave me here!

600
00:43:03,755 --> 00:43:04,838
Please don't!

601
00:43:09,603 --> 00:43:10,436
- Ariel?

602
00:43:11,684 --> 00:43:12,517
Ariel!

603
00:43:16,617 --> 00:43:17,450
Ariel?

604
00:43:19,723 --> 00:43:20,556
Ariel!

605
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:24,349
(dramatic music)

606
00:43:33,356 --> 00:43:35,143
Where is she?

607
00:43:35,143 --> 00:43:36,791
Ariel!

608
00:43:36,791 --> 00:43:37,781
Where is she?

609
00:43:37,781 --> 00:43:39,874
The woman I was with, where is she?

610
00:43:39,874 --> 00:43:42,043
- [Clan Man] Go away, leave us alone!

611
00:43:42,043 --> 00:43:43,702
Go!

612
00:43:43,702 --> 00:43:44,535
Go away!

613
00:43:45,443 --> 00:43:46,526
- [Ariel] No!

614
00:43:47,856 --> 00:43:49,846
Help me, please!

615
00:43:49,846 --> 00:43:53,263
(faint beastly growling)

616
00:44:03,718 --> 00:44:08,718
(arrow firing)
(henchman groaning)

617
00:44:16,770 --> 00:44:18,180
- He is dead!

618
00:44:18,180 --> 00:44:19,970
- I should kill you.

619
00:44:19,970 --> 00:44:21,120
Where is Ariel?

620
00:44:21,120 --> 00:44:23,173
- There is nothing you can do.

621
00:44:24,210 --> 00:44:26,154
It is too late.

622
00:44:26,154 --> 00:44:27,840
(Elaba laughing)

623
00:44:27,840 --> 00:44:28,945
- Then die.

624
00:44:28,945 --> 00:44:33,400
(arrow firing)
(Elaba screaming)

625
00:44:33,400 --> 00:44:36,400
(henchman groaning)

626
00:44:39,030 --> 00:44:39,957
That's for my dog.

627
00:44:42,715 --> 00:44:44,715
- [Ariel] Oh my God, no!

628
00:44:46,077 --> 00:44:48,641
No!
(beastly growling)

629
00:44:48,641 --> 00:44:50,724
Somebody help me, please!

630
00:44:52,781 --> 00:44:53,614
No!

631
00:44:56,453 --> 00:44:57,953
No, don't hurt me!

632
00:45:00,173 --> 00:45:01,006
Don't!

633
00:45:02,513 --> 00:45:03,846
Help me, please!

634
00:45:05,829 --> 00:45:06,662
Oh, no!

635
00:45:10,117 --> 00:45:11,735
No!

636
00:45:11,735 --> 00:45:14,568
(Ariel screaming)

637
00:45:21,178 --> 00:45:22,879
(beastly growling)
No, no!

638
00:45:22,879 --> 00:45:24,482
David!

639
00:45:24,482 --> 00:45:29,482
(arrow firing)
(beastly growling)

640
00:45:36,425 --> 00:45:37,842
David, watch out!

641
00:45:38,881 --> 00:45:43,881
(beastly growling)
(Ariel screaming)

642
00:45:47,906 --> 00:45:52,906
(dog whistle blowing)
(beastly screaming)

643
00:46:07,139 --> 00:46:09,806
(Ariel yelling)

644
00:46:12,476 --> 00:46:15,143
(Ariel sobbing)

645
00:46:19,563 --> 00:46:20,563
It raped me!

646
00:46:22,709 --> 00:46:24,509
I couldn't move!

647
00:46:24,509 --> 00:46:25,842
I couldn't move!

648
00:46:27,332 --> 00:46:30,321
There was nothing I could do!

649
00:46:30,321 --> 00:46:32,832
- We have to get away from
here before nightfall.

650
00:46:32,832 --> 00:46:35,499
(Ariel sobbing)

651
00:46:37,125 --> 00:46:37,958
Come on.

652
00:46:39,137 --> 00:46:40,721
Come on.

653
00:46:40,721 --> 00:46:43,471
(dramatic music)

654
00:47:08,143 --> 00:47:08,976
I'm right here.

655
00:47:08,976 --> 00:47:11,196
- [Ariel] Oh God David, oh my God!

656
00:47:11,196 --> 00:47:13,509
David!
- Shh, it's okay.

657
00:47:13,509 --> 00:47:14,342
I'm right here.

658
00:47:14,342 --> 00:47:17,675
- You don't know horrible I feel inside!

659
00:47:18,651 --> 00:47:21,183
- There's nothing we can do
about it, we just have to go on.

660
00:47:22,687 --> 00:47:25,355
I want you to rest.

661
00:47:25,355 --> 00:47:26,855
Just try to sleep.

662
00:47:40,113 --> 00:47:42,590
- [David] David Pennington
to Rocky Mountain Lab,

663
00:47:42,590 --> 00:47:44,930
listening 145.5, over.

664
00:47:44,930 --> 00:47:47,130
- This is Rocky Mountain
Lab, come in, David.

665
00:47:47,130 --> 00:47:47,993
- Good news, Von.

666
00:47:48,906 --> 00:47:50,680
I got all the base elements for a vaccine.

667
00:47:50,680 --> 00:47:52,290
- Thank God, we need ya, David.

668
00:47:52,290 --> 00:47:53,560
- I don't know how long
it's gonna take me,

669
00:47:53,560 --> 00:47:54,900
but I'm heading out now.

670
00:47:54,900 --> 00:47:55,733
Over and out.

671
00:47:57,450 --> 00:47:58,400
- Don't touch that.

672
00:47:59,250 --> 00:48:00,400
- [Dewitt] Don't touch what?

673
00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:01,233
- Anything.

674
00:48:07,600 --> 00:48:09,250
- Why didn't you tell them what happened?

675
00:48:09,250 --> 00:48:11,969
- They've got enough to
worry about right now.

676
00:48:11,969 --> 00:48:15,100
I just want to get you
there and have you examined.

677
00:48:15,100 --> 00:48:15,933
How do you feel?

678
00:48:17,050 --> 00:48:18,893
- Strange, really strange.

679
00:48:21,187 --> 00:48:23,937
(dramatic music)

680
00:48:29,784 --> 00:48:34,784
(wet squishing)
(heart beating)

681
00:48:38,060 --> 00:48:41,560
(Jamie breathing heavily)

682
00:48:49,720 --> 00:48:50,740
- Oh my God, he's burnin' up!

683
00:48:50,740 --> 00:48:52,303
Give us a hand over here, Kara!

684
00:48:53,212 --> 00:48:56,712
(Jamie breathing heavily)

685
00:48:58,090 --> 00:49:02,960
- High fever, dilated
pupils, facial lesions.

686
00:49:02,960 --> 00:49:05,124
Classic plague symptoms.

687
00:49:05,124 --> 00:49:06,232
- No.

688
00:49:06,232 --> 00:49:07,065
No!

689
00:49:07,065 --> 00:49:08,280
No, it can't be!

690
00:49:08,280 --> 00:49:10,688
I have a vaccine, I can't be sick!

691
00:49:10,688 --> 00:49:11,924
- What the hell is he talking about?

692
00:49:11,924 --> 00:49:12,757
- Oh God!

693
00:49:12,757 --> 00:49:14,380
I'm sorry, Sharon.

694
00:49:14,380 --> 00:49:15,880
Tell them.

695
00:49:15,880 --> 00:49:17,120
- What vaccine, Sharon?

696
00:49:17,120 --> 00:49:18,570
- Don't look at me, I
don't know what he means.

697
00:49:18,570 --> 00:49:20,200
- Tell them.

698
00:49:20,200 --> 00:49:22,620
She found Phil's pouch topside.

699
00:49:22,620 --> 00:49:24,940
She was able to make vaccine for us.

700
00:49:24,940 --> 00:49:25,773
Tell them!

701
00:49:26,630 --> 00:49:27,800
- Is this true?

702
00:49:27,800 --> 00:49:29,070
- Of course not.

703
00:49:29,070 --> 00:49:30,860
- You've gotta tell them the truth.

704
00:49:30,860 --> 00:49:32,870
I don't know what's wrong with me.

705
00:49:32,870 --> 00:49:33,703
Help me!

706
00:49:33,703 --> 00:49:35,163
- I never gave you anything!

707
00:49:36,970 --> 00:49:38,520
- That's it, isn't it?

708
00:49:38,520 --> 00:49:40,210
You didn't give me any!

709
00:49:40,210 --> 00:49:42,720
What'd you inject me with, a placebo?

710
00:49:42,720 --> 00:49:44,980
You never gave me any real vaccine at all!

711
00:49:44,980 --> 00:49:46,600
- Get him away from me!
- It was a lie!

712
00:49:46,600 --> 00:49:47,566
- Get him away from me!

713
00:49:47,566 --> 00:49:49,236
- You lied all along!

714
00:49:49,236 --> 00:49:50,572
- All right, calm down!

715
00:49:50,572 --> 00:49:51,717
Shut up!

716
00:49:51,717 --> 00:49:55,120
Okay, I want the truth, and I want it now.

717
00:49:55,120 --> 00:49:56,153
- I told you.

718
00:49:57,120 --> 00:49:59,240
- All right, Dewitt, let him go.

719
00:49:59,240 --> 00:50:01,285
- No wait!
- Let me go!

720
00:50:01,285 --> 00:50:02,610
Let me go!

721
00:50:02,610 --> 00:50:04,300
- All right, yes.

722
00:50:04,300 --> 00:50:07,820
I did it, I did find Phil's pouch topside.

723
00:50:07,820 --> 00:50:09,660
But there was only enough for one of us.

724
00:50:09,660 --> 00:50:11,077
What was I supposed to do?

725
00:50:11,077 --> 00:50:12,480
You can't blame me.

726
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:14,280
I found it, it was mine!

727
00:50:14,280 --> 00:50:16,790
- You kept it yourself,
knowing Robin was sick?

728
00:50:16,790 --> 00:50:20,024
- It's too late for her, but not for me.

729
00:50:20,024 --> 00:50:21,960
Can't you see, I'm strong?

730
00:50:21,960 --> 00:50:24,490
I can help the rest of us even more now.

731
00:50:24,490 --> 00:50:26,780
- You fuckin' bitch!

732
00:50:26,780 --> 00:50:28,840
- That's enough!
- I'll kill you!

733
00:50:28,840 --> 00:50:29,750
- Stop it!

734
00:50:29,750 --> 00:50:30,740
Kyle, cool off!

735
00:50:30,740 --> 00:50:31,913
Damn it, stop it!

736
00:50:33,010 --> 00:50:35,360
- Dewitt, get Jamie to med bay.

737
00:50:35,360 --> 00:50:37,330
Sharon, get up, you're not hurt.

738
00:50:37,330 --> 00:50:40,270
- I'm afraid of dying,
don't you understand?

739
00:50:40,270 --> 00:50:41,320
- You're pathetic.

740
00:50:41,320 --> 00:50:42,873
- I want her out of here.

741
00:50:46,737 --> 00:50:49,077
- What is it?
(tense music)

742
00:50:49,077 --> 00:50:50,243
- It's the generator.

743
00:50:50,243 --> 00:50:51,490
- Fix it, Kyle.

744
00:50:51,490 --> 00:50:54,040
Without power, we're
completely vulnerable topside.

745
00:50:54,040 --> 00:50:54,873
- All right, nobody move,

746
00:50:54,873 --> 00:50:56,853
and the backup genny
will kick in in a moment.

747
00:50:59,210 --> 00:51:00,910
- What's goin' on, Kyle?

748
00:51:00,910 --> 00:51:02,683
- Dewitt, hit the emergency lights.

749
00:51:05,063 --> 00:51:07,730
(alarm blaring)

750
00:51:09,073 --> 00:51:10,610
(distant clattering)

751
00:51:10,610 --> 00:51:12,960
- Sweet Jesus, it's the topside hatch!

752
00:51:12,960 --> 00:51:15,640
- You mean those goddamn
things have broken in?

753
00:51:15,640 --> 00:51:18,540
- [Kyle] We have no way of
knowing, the video's down!

754
00:51:18,540 --> 00:51:19,373
- Dewitt!

755
00:51:19,373 --> 00:51:21,060
Get the door open, I'm goin' up.

756
00:51:21,060 --> 00:51:21,893
- You're crazy to go up there!

757
00:51:21,893 --> 00:51:23,500
Don't be a dang fool!

758
00:51:23,500 --> 00:51:25,430
- Somebody's gotta
secure that topside hatch

759
00:51:25,430 --> 00:51:26,650
or we're all screwed.

760
00:51:26,650 --> 00:51:28,840
Now get the door open, Dewitt.

761
00:51:28,840 --> 00:51:31,168
- Kyle, give me a hand with Jamie.

762
00:51:31,168 --> 00:51:33,835
(alarm blaring)

763
00:51:39,070 --> 00:51:41,130
- [Von] Seal off the door
as soon as I'm through.

764
00:51:41,130 --> 00:51:42,900
Anything happens to me in there,

765
00:51:42,900 --> 00:51:44,290
you can fry the bastards

766
00:51:44,290 --> 00:51:46,290
as soon as you're back up to full power.

767
00:51:51,959 --> 00:51:54,459
(tense music)

768
00:52:40,276 --> 00:52:43,609
(Von breathing heavily)

769
00:52:50,640 --> 00:52:51,807
- Von Demming?

770
00:52:54,180 --> 00:52:55,143
- David Pennington?

771
00:52:57,930 --> 00:52:59,480
- I just hope I'm not too late.

772
00:53:03,250 --> 00:53:06,490
- Looks like the boys got
the generator back online.

773
00:53:06,490 --> 00:53:09,750
Why don't we secure that
hatch and get you below?

774
00:53:09,750 --> 00:53:11,623
My crew's gonna be happy to see you.

775
00:53:13,703 --> 00:53:14,930
- Dewitt's working on some circuitry.

776
00:53:14,930 --> 00:53:15,943
We'll be fine now.

777
00:53:17,960 --> 00:53:20,190
- I'd like to know one thing, David.

778
00:53:20,190 --> 00:53:21,950
How'd you get past the Lusus?

779
00:53:21,950 --> 00:53:24,910
- Their ears are very sensitive
to high frequency sound.

780
00:53:24,910 --> 00:53:26,833
This dog whistle backs 'em right up.

781
00:53:29,210 --> 00:53:31,080
- [Kyle] How's the vaccine coming along?

782
00:53:31,080 --> 00:53:32,910
- Sharon's in the lab now working on it.

783
00:53:32,910 --> 00:53:35,890
- What, you trust her
alone with that stuff?

784
00:53:35,890 --> 00:53:38,200
- Now just what in the
hell would you have us do?

785
00:53:38,200 --> 00:53:39,440
Post a guard on her?

786
00:53:39,440 --> 00:53:42,063
If she betrays us again, I'll kill her.

787
00:53:43,070 --> 00:53:44,830
- You're not eating?

788
00:53:44,830 --> 00:53:46,028
- I'm not hungry.

789
00:53:46,028 --> 00:53:48,861
(dramatic music)

790
00:53:51,870 --> 00:53:53,667
- When did you say she conceived?

791
00:53:56,271 --> 00:53:57,531
- We're...

792
00:53:57,531 --> 00:53:58,527
We're not exactly sure.

793
00:53:58,527 --> 00:54:00,460
- God, just tell them!

794
00:54:00,460 --> 00:54:02,370
It was only a few weeks ago.

795
00:54:02,370 --> 00:54:05,130
I'm scared, I don't know
what's going on inside my body,

796
00:54:05,130 --> 00:54:06,790
but it's not normal!

797
00:54:06,790 --> 00:54:09,687
I just want it out of me, please!

798
00:54:09,687 --> 00:54:10,709
Oh!

799
00:54:10,709 --> 00:54:12,003
Oh God!

800
00:54:13,557 --> 00:54:15,550
(Ariel groaning)

801
00:54:15,550 --> 00:54:16,383
Oh God!

802
00:54:19,680 --> 00:54:21,310
- Get her to med bay and sedate her!

803
00:54:21,310 --> 00:54:23,460
I want to perform an
immediate laparoscopy.

804
00:54:27,602 --> 00:54:29,040
(heart monitor beeping)

805
00:54:29,040 --> 00:54:30,880
Jamie's getting worse.

806
00:54:30,880 --> 00:54:32,970
Kyle, I'm gonna need the OR clear.

807
00:54:32,970 --> 00:54:34,440
Why don't you take Robin to your quarters

808
00:54:34,440 --> 00:54:35,550
and see that she's comfortable?

809
00:54:35,550 --> 00:54:36,650
- [Kyle] Thanks, Kara.

810
00:54:41,817 --> 00:54:43,150
- How's she doing?

811
00:54:43,150 --> 00:54:43,983
- Hanging in.

812
00:54:45,990 --> 00:54:47,280
- I haven't dealt with pregnancies

813
00:54:47,280 --> 00:54:48,740
since before the accident,

814
00:54:48,740 --> 00:54:51,490
but I've never seen anything like this.

815
00:54:51,490 --> 00:54:53,193
Living topside with all
that foreign bacteria,

816
00:54:53,193 --> 00:54:55,993
there's no telling what's
going on inside her body.

817
00:54:57,570 --> 00:54:59,300
- Something I can help you with, Kara?

818
00:54:59,300 --> 00:55:01,960
- Yes, Dewitt, please take
Jamie up to the research lab.

819
00:55:01,960 --> 00:55:04,210
Someone can keep an eye on him there.

820
00:55:04,210 --> 00:55:07,543
(heart monitor beeping)

821
00:55:08,850 --> 00:55:10,840
I ran an MRI scan,

822
00:55:10,840 --> 00:55:13,210
and a regenerative karyotype.

823
00:55:13,210 --> 00:55:15,370
I want to put 'em through
the computer upstairs.

824
00:55:15,370 --> 00:55:17,370
Ariel's labor seems to have subsided now,

825
00:55:17,370 --> 00:55:18,350
so we have a little time.

826
00:55:18,350 --> 00:55:20,823
Do you want to go up with
me and check the results?

827
00:55:22,620 --> 00:55:23,453
- Sure.

828
00:55:28,510 --> 00:55:30,320
- What are you doing?

829
00:55:30,320 --> 00:55:32,020
- Kara needs the OR.

830
00:55:32,020 --> 00:55:33,760
Says to put Jamie in here.

831
00:55:33,760 --> 00:55:36,580
- Just put him over there, and be careful.

832
00:55:36,580 --> 00:55:37,780
I'll keep an eye on him.

833
00:55:48,890 --> 00:55:50,690
Just get outta here and let me work.

834
00:55:56,482 --> 00:55:59,149
(heart beating)

835
00:56:02,674 --> 00:56:03,757
- I'm scared.

836
00:56:06,950 --> 00:56:08,623
- You gotta be positive, baby.

837
00:56:09,592 --> 00:56:11,083
The vaccine will be ready soon.

838
00:56:11,944 --> 00:56:13,273
You're gonna get well.

839
00:56:15,570 --> 00:56:18,423
- I just need to sleep, I'll be fine.

840
00:56:20,520 --> 00:56:21,670
You go help the others.

841
00:56:26,830 --> 00:56:29,260
- Using karyotype and MRI data,

842
00:56:29,260 --> 00:56:30,970
the computer should be able to show us

843
00:56:30,970 --> 00:56:33,833
the generative process
that causes aberration.

844
00:56:36,420 --> 00:56:38,170
- Conception was completely normal.

845
00:56:39,290 --> 00:56:41,170
When did you know she was pregnant, David?

846
00:56:41,170 --> 00:56:42,603
- She suspected immediately.

847
00:56:43,440 --> 00:56:45,420
I thought it was way too early to tell.

848
00:56:45,420 --> 00:56:46,792
- Then you're the father?

849
00:56:46,792 --> 00:56:47,625
(sighing)

850
00:56:47,625 --> 00:56:49,270
- Yeah.

851
00:56:49,270 --> 00:56:50,170
- [Kara] My God...

852
00:56:52,690 --> 00:56:54,203
- What in the hell is that?

853
00:56:55,100 --> 00:56:56,800
- A mutant sperm of some sort

854
00:56:56,800 --> 00:57:00,320
forcing its way into the
embryo, fusing with it,

855
00:57:00,320 --> 00:57:02,033
battling for genetic dominance.

856
00:57:04,330 --> 00:57:07,050
She was raped soon after
she conceived, wasn't she?

857
00:57:07,050 --> 00:57:08,390
Why didn't you tell us?

858
00:57:08,390 --> 00:57:09,460
- Is this true?

859
00:57:09,460 --> 00:57:11,490
You knowingly brought
a woman into this lab

860
00:57:11,490 --> 00:57:13,180
who has been exposed to the Lusus?

861
00:57:13,180 --> 00:57:15,210
- I put her at risk when I left her to go

862
00:57:15,210 --> 00:57:18,185
and search for raw materials
to save your personnel!

863
00:57:18,185 --> 00:57:21,570
What the hell was I
supposed to do, abandon her?

864
00:57:21,570 --> 00:57:22,840
I love this woman, Von.

865
00:57:22,840 --> 00:57:24,330
- Well, that's not good enough!

866
00:57:24,330 --> 00:57:26,010
I want it aborted, stat!

867
00:57:26,010 --> 00:57:27,323
- We can't do that, look.

868
00:57:28,320 --> 00:57:30,330
The fetus is enveloped
by muscular somites,

869
00:57:30,330 --> 00:57:32,440
which have attached
themselves to Ariel's kidneys.

870
00:57:32,440 --> 00:57:34,790
To try and forcibly
remove it would kill her.

871
00:57:34,790 --> 00:57:36,790
- [Von] Well, what in the hell do we do?

872
00:57:37,757 --> 00:57:38,660
- Do?

873
00:57:38,660 --> 00:57:41,200
You don't have to do anything,
this is my responsibility.

874
00:57:41,200 --> 00:57:43,680
- The primary goal is
to save Ariel's life.

875
00:57:43,680 --> 00:57:46,760
- And my primary goal is to
protect the lives of my crew.

876
00:57:46,760 --> 00:57:48,270
- I'll deliver the baby myself.

877
00:57:48,270 --> 00:57:51,420
Seal all access to med bay,
keep everyone out of there.

878
00:57:51,420 --> 00:57:53,030
If anything goes wrong,
it'll be contained,

879
00:57:53,030 --> 00:57:54,960
and I'll deal with it, one way or another.

880
00:57:54,960 --> 00:57:55,900
- You're gonna need help.

881
00:57:55,900 --> 00:57:57,820
I'll be there, you can assist me.

882
00:57:57,820 --> 00:58:00,057
- No, I won't allow it.

883
00:58:00,057 --> 00:58:01,540
- [Kara] Von...

884
00:58:01,540 --> 00:58:03,280
- How long before she goes into labor?

885
00:58:03,280 --> 00:58:05,261
- [Kara] Any time now.

886
00:58:05,261 --> 00:58:06,310
- I don't like it.

887
00:58:06,310 --> 00:58:07,860
- I'm afraid we have no choice.

888
00:58:09,400 --> 00:58:10,850
- Von, Kara?

889
00:58:10,850 --> 00:58:12,040
We've got it.

890
00:58:12,040 --> 00:58:14,220
I've already injected Jamie and Robin.

891
00:58:14,220 --> 00:58:15,910
I just hope they respond.

892
00:58:15,910 --> 00:58:18,071
- Kyle, Dewitt, get your
butts up here on the double

893
00:58:18,071 --> 00:58:19,571
for inoculations.

894
00:58:20,621 --> 00:58:21,967
- [Dewitt] I don't believe it.

895
00:58:21,967 --> 00:58:23,483
The minx did it!

896
00:58:23,483 --> 00:58:26,201
- [Kyle] Thank God, let's go.

897
00:58:26,201 --> 00:58:31,201
(wet squishing)
(heart beating)

898
00:58:48,550 --> 00:58:50,880
- I want you to stay
next to her, hold her,

899
00:58:50,880 --> 00:58:52,120
help her with her breathing.

900
00:58:52,120 --> 00:58:53,393
I'll handle the delivery.

901
00:58:54,976 --> 00:58:57,720
(Ariel groaning and breathing heavily)

902
00:58:57,720 --> 00:58:59,300
- Are you all right?

903
00:58:59,300 --> 00:59:00,470
- I think so.

904
00:59:00,470 --> 00:59:01,620
- Breathe, Ariel.

905
00:59:01,620 --> 00:59:02,870
Breathe through the pain.

906
00:59:03,930 --> 00:59:04,763
Good.

907
00:59:07,060 --> 00:59:08,514
It's almost time.

908
00:59:08,514 --> 00:59:11,379
(Ariel breathing heavily)

909
00:59:11,379 --> 00:59:13,674
(wet squishing)
(heart beating)

910
00:59:13,674 --> 00:59:16,007
- Well, you're the last one.

911
00:59:17,550 --> 00:59:18,560
Von, I'm so sorry.

912
00:59:18,560 --> 00:59:19,640
- Save it.

913
00:59:19,640 --> 00:59:22,500
It'll be a long time before
you gain my trust back.

914
00:59:26,749 --> 00:59:31,749
(heart beating)
(Jamie moaning muffled)

915
00:59:32,930 --> 00:59:34,970
- [Kara] Push Ariel,
it's starting to come,

916
00:59:34,970 --> 00:59:36,380
but I need you to help me.

917
00:59:36,380 --> 00:59:37,963
- Just breathe through it!
- Just push.

918
00:59:37,963 --> 00:59:39,286
- Breathe through the pain!
(Ariel screaming)

919
00:59:39,286 --> 00:59:40,346
- [Kara] Push.

920
00:59:40,346 --> 00:59:41,491
More.

921
00:59:41,491 --> 00:59:42,324
Push.

922
00:59:42,324 --> 00:59:43,940
That's good.

923
00:59:43,940 --> 00:59:45,490
- [David] Breathe through the pain!

924
00:59:45,490 --> 00:59:47,950
- [Kara] Okay, I can see the head now.

925
00:59:47,950 --> 00:59:50,160
All right, one last time now.

926
00:59:50,160 --> 00:59:51,437
Come on, push.

927
00:59:51,437 --> 00:59:52,572
Push.

928
00:59:52,572 --> 00:59:53,796
Push!

929
00:59:53,796 --> 00:59:54,844
Push!

930
00:59:54,844 --> 00:59:59,256
More, more, more!
(Ariel screaming)

931
00:59:59,256 --> 01:00:00,089
Good!

932
01:00:01,143 --> 01:00:04,818
(Ariel laughing hysterically)

933
01:00:04,818 --> 01:00:08,151
(heart monitor beeping)

934
01:00:10,490 --> 01:00:12,320
David, come here, I need your help.

935
01:00:15,658 --> 01:00:18,265
- [David] Oh my God...

936
01:00:18,265 --> 01:00:19,098
- What?

937
01:00:19,098 --> 01:00:20,015
What is it?

938
01:00:22,777 --> 01:00:24,540
- Scissors.
- What?

939
01:00:24,540 --> 01:00:25,373
Is my baby dead?

940
01:00:26,580 --> 01:00:28,143
- [Kara] No, Ariel, your baby's alive.

941
01:00:28,143 --> 01:00:29,470
(baby crying)
- What's the matter?

942
01:00:29,470 --> 01:00:30,900
I want to see my baby.

943
01:00:30,900 --> 01:00:31,923
- You don't want to.

944
01:00:32,910 --> 01:00:34,163
- Show me my baby!

945
01:00:35,440 --> 01:00:37,205
Show me my baby!

946
01:00:37,205 --> 01:00:39,541
(baby screeching)
No!

947
01:00:39,541 --> 01:00:41,170
(alarm blaring)
- We've got an emergency.

948
01:00:41,170 --> 01:00:42,780
Von wants you in the
research lab right away.

949
01:00:42,780 --> 01:00:44,521
- [Kara] What kind of emergency?

950
01:00:44,521 --> 01:00:46,053
- You better see Von.

951
01:00:46,053 --> 01:00:46,909
- [Kara] I'll take care of this.

952
01:00:46,909 --> 01:00:50,959
Sharon, stay here with Ariel.
(baby crying)

953
01:00:50,959 --> 01:00:53,626
(Ariel sobbing)

954
01:00:56,428 --> 01:00:57,884
David, let's go.

955
01:00:57,884 --> 01:00:59,777
We'll secure the door as we leave.

956
01:00:59,777 --> 01:01:03,527
(baby crying and screeching)

957
01:01:10,774 --> 01:01:13,441
(Ariel sobbing)

958
01:01:14,838 --> 01:01:16,171
Von, what is it?

959
01:01:20,658 --> 01:01:22,708
- Why don't you have a look for yourself?

960
01:01:27,574 --> 01:01:29,453
- Oh Christ, Jamie!

961
01:01:31,540 --> 01:01:34,400
- Somehow that Lusus
appendage Robin was studying

962
01:01:34,400 --> 01:01:35,610
has regenerated.

963
01:01:35,610 --> 01:01:37,763
It's broken into the levels below us.

964
01:01:38,750 --> 01:01:41,470
Kyle, Dewitt, break out all weapons.

965
01:01:41,470 --> 01:01:43,603
I'll seal off the lower levels.

966
01:01:44,520 --> 01:01:46,860
Honey, you and David get Ariel and Sharon

967
01:01:46,860 --> 01:01:48,960
out of med bay now.

968
01:01:48,960 --> 01:01:51,410
We'll all muster into
control room in 10 minutes.

969
01:02:15,054 --> 01:02:16,674
- I'll meet you in control.

970
01:02:16,674 --> 01:02:17,742
- [Dewitt] Yeah.

971
01:02:17,742 --> 01:02:20,242
(tense music)

972
01:02:47,360 --> 01:02:50,027
(Robin sighing)

973
01:03:03,882 --> 01:03:05,870
- Don't do that!

974
01:03:05,870 --> 01:03:07,460
- Don't do what?

975
01:03:07,460 --> 01:03:08,360
- Nevermind.

976
01:03:08,360 --> 01:03:09,793
Let's just get upstairs, okay?

977
01:03:15,446 --> 01:03:16,750
(Kara gasping)

978
01:03:16,750 --> 01:03:19,470
- [Kara] Oh God, we should
have killed it at birth, David.

979
01:03:19,470 --> 01:03:22,020
It's broken out of the
incubator and shed its skin.

980
01:03:23,360 --> 01:03:24,743
Get Ariel out of here now.

981
01:03:27,740 --> 01:03:28,813
- [Sharon] Oh God!

982
01:03:29,820 --> 01:03:31,000
- [Kara] Sharon, what happened?

983
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:32,170
- It's huge, Kara.

984
01:03:32,170 --> 01:03:33,930
It's 10 times the size it was.

985
01:03:33,930 --> 01:03:34,783
- Where'd it go?

986
01:03:35,750 --> 01:03:36,910
- The air duct.

987
01:03:36,910 --> 01:03:39,710
I've never seen anything
like it, it's still growing.

988
01:03:39,710 --> 01:03:40,623
- Come on, let's get out of here.

989
01:03:40,623 --> 01:03:42,480
Come on, quick.

990
01:03:42,480 --> 01:03:43,580
Let's get out of here.

991
01:03:53,387 --> 01:03:55,670
(electronic beeping)
(door whooshing)

992
01:03:55,670 --> 01:03:57,860
- Well gang, our worst
nightmare has come true.

993
01:03:57,860 --> 01:03:59,820
We've got a pair of
those bastards down there

994
01:03:59,820 --> 01:04:01,490
and we've gotta get 'em out.

995
01:04:01,490 --> 01:04:02,500
David, give us some insight.

996
01:04:02,500 --> 01:04:05,370
- We had the same situation
with one of 'em in Mojave.

997
01:04:05,370 --> 01:04:08,090
The only option is to kill
them before they kill us.

998
01:04:08,090 --> 01:04:09,730
- How would you recommend we proceed?

999
01:04:09,730 --> 01:04:11,207
- We split into two teams.

1000
01:04:11,207 --> 01:04:12,810
We isolate the women up here,

1001
01:04:12,810 --> 01:04:13,820
that's what it'll be after.

1002
01:04:13,820 --> 01:04:15,370
- You can isolate whoever you want to pal,

1003
01:04:15,370 --> 01:04:16,750
I'm not sittin' anywhere.

1004
01:04:16,750 --> 01:04:18,100
I'm goin' down there.

1005
01:04:18,100 --> 01:04:18,940
- Fine.

1006
01:04:18,940 --> 01:04:20,240
Just don't let one take you alive,

1007
01:04:20,240 --> 01:04:22,180
they use human women for procreation.

1008
01:04:22,180 --> 01:04:24,150
You and Von take the lower levels.

1009
01:04:24,150 --> 01:04:25,510
Dewitt, you and I will
take the upper ones.

1010
01:04:25,510 --> 01:04:27,530
Be sure and check all
shafts and air ducts.

1011
01:04:27,530 --> 01:04:29,710
- Kyle, you and Kara stay here with Ariel.

1012
01:04:29,710 --> 01:04:31,790
Seal off all access to the control room

1013
01:04:31,790 --> 01:04:32,920
as soon as we leave.

1014
01:04:32,920 --> 01:04:36,590
I want everyone to maintain
constant headset communications.

1015
01:04:36,590 --> 01:04:37,597
Is that clear?

1016
01:04:37,597 --> 01:04:38,977
- Yes sir.
- I got it.

1017
01:04:38,977 --> 01:04:41,340
- Kyle and Kara can use
the surveillance monitors

1018
01:04:41,340 --> 01:04:43,020
and be our forward eyes and ears.

1019
01:04:43,020 --> 01:04:44,370
Is Robin secure?

1020
01:04:44,370 --> 01:04:45,400
- She's resting comfortably.

1021
01:04:45,400 --> 01:04:47,230
I've sealed up all access to our quarters.

1022
01:04:47,230 --> 01:04:48,330
- Dewitt, what about weapons?

1023
01:04:48,330 --> 01:04:50,970
- Well, we've got a couple of flare guns,

1024
01:04:50,970 --> 01:04:53,079
uh, one for each team.

1025
01:04:53,079 --> 01:04:54,710
They'll make a great big hole

1026
01:04:54,710 --> 01:04:56,650
and they keep right on burnin'.

1027
01:04:56,650 --> 01:04:58,983
Kyle, here's your weapon for you and Kara.

1028
01:04:59,830 --> 01:05:02,080
Von, you've got your service revolver.

1029
01:05:02,080 --> 01:05:04,737
Uh, Sharon, here's a high
voltage stun gun for you.

1030
01:05:04,737 --> 01:05:06,140
Now it's not gonna kill 'em,

1031
01:05:06,140 --> 01:05:09,180
but it'll doggone sure buy
you some time if you need it.

1032
01:05:09,180 --> 01:05:11,050
Now I've rigged myself up a flamethrower

1033
01:05:11,050 --> 01:05:13,010
out of some old welding equipment.

1034
01:05:13,010 --> 01:05:15,610
And David, you've got your crossbow there.

1035
01:05:15,610 --> 01:05:16,650
That's it.

1036
01:05:16,650 --> 01:05:17,900
- I told you about their sensitivity

1037
01:05:17,900 --> 01:05:19,100
to high frequency sound.

1038
01:05:19,980 --> 01:05:21,540
Kara, a blast of this over the intercom

1039
01:05:21,540 --> 01:05:23,760
every now and then might
help us locate 'em.

1040
01:05:23,760 --> 01:05:26,303
- Now, does anybody got any questions?

1041
01:05:27,440 --> 01:05:29,323
Good, let's do it.

1042
01:05:35,920 --> 01:05:36,753
- Be careful.

1043
01:05:38,120 --> 01:05:38,953
- You too, babe.

1044
01:05:41,330 --> 01:05:42,163
Let's move it.

1045
01:05:53,157 --> 01:05:56,157
(elevator whirring)

1046
01:05:59,150 --> 01:06:00,583
Kyle, we're on level six.

1047
01:06:01,775 --> 01:06:03,375
What's the passageway look like?

1048
01:06:05,360 --> 01:06:06,300
- All clear, Von.

1049
01:06:08,220 --> 01:06:09,120
- Let's get goin'.

1050
01:06:11,350 --> 01:06:14,570
Damn power outages have
screwed these doors.

1051
01:06:14,570 --> 01:06:16,081
Open, damn it!

1052
01:06:16,081 --> 01:06:19,164
(electronic beeping)

1053
01:06:27,300 --> 01:06:28,713
- Switch to level three.

1054
01:06:33,690 --> 01:06:35,340
You're clear so far, David.

1055
01:06:35,340 --> 01:06:37,390
- Roger, moving along.

1056
01:06:37,390 --> 01:06:38,223
What do you think?

1057
01:06:38,223 --> 01:06:39,300
Should we flush it out?

1058
01:06:40,490 --> 01:06:41,510
- Might as well.

1059
01:06:43,980 --> 01:06:44,813
- Kara?

1060
01:06:45,833 --> 01:06:48,510
Blow the dog whistle into
the intercom one time.

1061
01:06:48,510 --> 01:06:49,350
- All right, David.

1062
01:06:49,350 --> 01:06:51,990
We better warn Sharon and Von, right?

1063
01:06:51,990 --> 01:06:53,630
- Von, we're gonna try
the high frequency sound

1064
01:06:53,630 --> 01:06:54,670
over the intercom.

1065
01:06:54,670 --> 01:06:55,713
Be prepared.

1066
01:06:59,762 --> 01:07:02,929
(dog whistle blowing)

1067
01:07:04,430 --> 01:07:05,263
- Look!

1068
01:07:06,343 --> 01:07:08,091
If you're thinkin' what I'm thinkin',

1069
01:07:08,091 --> 01:07:09,750
that thing can flat motor.

1070
01:07:09,750 --> 01:07:11,563
- [David] Must be the
thing that got Jamie.

1071
01:07:13,860 --> 01:07:16,930
- Kyle, we're entering level
six maintenance room right now.

1072
01:07:16,930 --> 01:07:19,606
- Be careful, Von, we've
got no video in there.

1073
01:07:19,606 --> 01:07:20,690
- Stand back.

1074
01:07:20,690 --> 01:07:22,773
I'm gonna light his fire.

1075
01:07:27,366 --> 01:07:29,770
(tense music)

1076
01:07:29,770 --> 01:07:32,603
(flame whooshing)

1077
01:07:42,681 --> 01:07:44,281
- Must have gone into the shaft.

1078
01:07:52,610 --> 01:07:53,990
- Let's go up to level one first

1079
01:07:53,990 --> 01:07:55,684
then back down to three.

1080
01:07:55,684 --> 01:07:56,684
- All right.

1081
01:08:00,971 --> 01:08:03,150
- Hell, I hate this.

1082
01:08:03,150 --> 01:08:06,759
- Let's split up and see if we
can catch him in between us.

1083
01:08:06,759 --> 01:08:09,260
- Don't you think we should stay together?

1084
01:08:09,260 --> 01:08:10,963
We don't know what we're up against yet.

1085
01:08:11,880 --> 01:08:14,670
- Not as brave as we were upstairs, huh?

1086
01:09:25,541 --> 01:09:28,412
(dramatic music)

1087
01:09:28,412 --> 01:09:31,668
(mutant growling)

1088
01:09:31,668 --> 01:09:34,065
(gun firing)
(mutant screeching)

1089
01:09:34,065 --> 01:09:35,065
- Oh my God!

1090
01:09:35,934 --> 01:09:37,675
- Von, come in, Von.

1091
01:09:37,675 --> 01:09:38,508
Von!

1092
01:09:38,508 --> 01:09:39,591
Von, come in!

1093
01:09:42,381 --> 01:09:43,490
(loud clattering)
- Von!

1094
01:09:43,490 --> 01:09:45,150
- Damn it, Von, come in!

1095
01:09:47,893 --> 01:09:48,726
- Von!

1096
01:09:50,276 --> 01:09:54,582
(flare gun firing)
(mutant screaming)

1097
01:09:54,582 --> 01:09:59,582
(stun gun buzzing)
(mutant screaming)

1098
01:10:01,536 --> 01:10:02,629
Kyle, we just encountered the thing

1099
01:10:02,629 --> 01:10:03,740
that Ariel gave birth to.

1100
01:10:03,740 --> 01:10:04,840
It attacked Von!

1101
01:10:04,840 --> 01:10:05,838
- Oh my God!

1102
01:10:05,838 --> 01:10:07,432
- Get outta here, I'll handle this!

1103
01:10:07,432 --> 01:10:08,265
- Let me help you!

1104
01:10:08,265 --> 01:10:11,265
- Go, get out here, that's an order!

1105
01:10:12,720 --> 01:10:16,140
(mutant growling)

1106
01:10:16,140 --> 01:10:18,469
(Von groaning)

1107
01:10:18,469 --> 01:10:20,498
- [Kyle] Von, come in!

1108
01:10:20,498 --> 01:10:23,248
(dramatic music)

1109
01:10:31,847 --> 01:10:34,638
- Come on, open!
(mutant screeching)

1110
01:10:34,638 --> 01:10:35,471
Come on!

1111
01:10:38,696 --> 01:10:39,529
No, no!

1112
01:10:47,160 --> 01:10:47,993
Oh my God!

1113
01:10:49,490 --> 01:10:52,850
(Sharon screaming)

1114
01:10:52,850 --> 01:10:54,230
- [Kara] We lost radio contact.

1115
01:10:54,230 --> 01:10:55,143
Sharon, come in!

1116
01:10:58,660 --> 01:11:01,493
- Well come on then, motherfucker!

1117
01:11:02,928 --> 01:11:05,845
(mutant screaming)

1118
01:11:08,187 --> 01:11:09,556
(Sharon screaming)

1119
01:11:09,556 --> 01:11:10,389
No, no!

1120
01:11:11,926 --> 01:11:12,843
No, oh God!

1121
01:11:14,186 --> 01:11:15,103
Oh God, no!

1122
01:11:16,990 --> 01:11:19,823
(mutant growling)

1123
01:11:31,463 --> 01:11:36,463
(loud thumping)
(mutant screeching)

1124
01:11:37,812 --> 01:11:38,743
- Sharon!

1125
01:11:38,743 --> 01:11:40,160
Get out of there!

1126
01:11:41,835 --> 01:11:46,835
(gun firing)
(mutant screeching)

1127
01:11:53,963 --> 01:11:54,796
- No!

1128
01:11:54,796 --> 01:11:58,554
(loud thumping)
(Sharon screaming)

1129
01:11:58,554 --> 01:12:01,804
Please, Von, help me out here, come on!

1130
01:12:02,830 --> 01:12:04,056
Come on, Von!

1131
01:12:04,056 --> 01:12:06,622
Von, turn on the incinerator, do it!

1132
01:12:06,622 --> 01:12:08,730
Don't let him take me!

1133
01:12:08,730 --> 01:12:11,480
(Sharon sobbing)

1134
01:12:13,107 --> 01:12:13,940
Yes, yes!

1135
01:12:15,917 --> 01:12:18,101
Yes, damn it, do it!

1136
01:12:18,101 --> 01:12:20,086
Do it, please!

1137
01:12:20,086 --> 01:12:25,086
(alarm beeping)
(mutant screeching)

1138
01:12:30,860 --> 01:12:34,027
(electronic warbling)

1139
01:12:41,976 --> 01:12:44,893
(mutant screaming)

1140
01:12:56,750 --> 01:12:58,620
- Just checked level one shaft access.

1141
01:12:58,620 --> 01:12:59,453
Nothing.

1142
01:13:00,789 --> 01:13:02,270
Headin' down to level three.

1143
01:13:02,270 --> 01:13:03,310
- Be careful, David.

1144
01:13:03,310 --> 01:13:06,039
We've lost contact with Von and Sharon.

1145
01:13:06,039 --> 01:13:07,610
- [David] Did they encounter anything?

1146
01:13:07,610 --> 01:13:09,460
- We're not sure, just be careful.

1147
01:13:09,460 --> 01:13:11,310
- Why didn't you tell them the truth?

1148
01:13:12,350 --> 01:13:13,550
- What good would it do?

1149
01:13:15,231 --> 01:13:17,814
(Kara sighing)

1150
01:13:22,140 --> 01:13:23,490
- Kyle, I'm at level three.

1151
01:13:24,410 --> 01:13:25,560
How's it lookin'?

1152
01:13:25,560 --> 01:13:27,220
- So far, clear, cowboy.

1153
01:13:28,962 --> 01:13:32,045
(electronic beeping)

1154
01:13:32,997 --> 01:13:37,997
Keep an eye out for it, will ya?

1155
01:13:42,217 --> 01:13:47,217
(beastly growling)
(Dewitt screaming)

1156
01:13:51,646 --> 01:13:52,479
- David, what is it?

1157
01:13:52,479 --> 01:13:54,870
Are you okay?
- It's got Dewitt!

1158
01:13:54,870 --> 01:13:59,870
(beastly growling)
(Dewitt screaming)

1159
01:14:11,885 --> 01:14:15,635
Kara, blow the dog
whistle over the intercom!

1160
01:14:16,659 --> 01:14:18,176
Blow that goddamn thing!

1161
01:14:18,176 --> 01:14:23,176
(dog whistle blowing)
(beastly screaming)

1162
01:14:25,458 --> 01:14:26,695
- [Kara] Look, it's working!

1163
01:14:26,695 --> 01:14:28,028
It's backing up!

1164
01:14:30,969 --> 01:14:35,969
(flame whooshing)
(beastly screaming)

1165
01:15:02,870 --> 01:15:03,703
Look!

1166
01:15:04,553 --> 01:15:05,600
(electronic beeping)

1167
01:15:05,600 --> 01:15:06,823
- David, come in!

1168
01:15:07,950 --> 01:15:08,913
David, come in!

1169
01:15:09,870 --> 01:15:11,200
- Yeah, it's David.

1170
01:15:11,200 --> 01:15:12,760
- Thank God you're alive.

1171
01:15:12,760 --> 01:15:14,373
There's someone in the elevator.

1172
01:15:14,373 --> 01:15:15,360
(electronic beeping)

1173
01:15:15,360 --> 01:15:16,243
- Oh my God...

1174
01:15:19,565 --> 01:15:23,730
- Dewitt's dead, but I killed
the thing that got Jamie.

1175
01:15:23,730 --> 01:15:25,380
It's on top of the elevator cage.

1176
01:15:27,710 --> 01:15:31,184
Just a minute, there's
someone in the cage.

1177
01:15:31,184 --> 01:15:33,236
(mutant growling)

1178
01:15:33,236 --> 01:15:35,153
I don't believe this...

1179
01:15:41,230 --> 01:15:43,413
It's not a someone, it's a something.

1180
01:15:44,307 --> 01:15:46,197
And it's on its way up to level one.

1181
01:15:50,038 --> 01:15:53,620
(wet squishing)
(heart beating)

1182
01:15:53,620 --> 01:15:56,907
(electronic beeping)

1183
01:15:56,907 --> 01:15:58,824
- How is that possible?

1184
01:16:03,570 --> 01:16:05,410
- Where's David, is he all right?

1185
01:16:05,410 --> 01:16:06,600
- Yes, he's fine.

1186
01:16:06,600 --> 01:16:08,000
I want you to listen to me.

1187
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:09,610
If we have any trouble in this sector,

1188
01:16:09,610 --> 01:16:11,557
I want you to stay here out of the way.

1189
01:16:11,557 --> 01:16:12,880
(electronic beeping)

1190
01:16:12,880 --> 01:16:15,310
If anything happens, remember that door

1191
01:16:15,310 --> 01:16:17,580
leads to the topside hatch.

1192
01:16:17,580 --> 01:16:18,872
Okay?

1193
01:16:18,872 --> 01:16:22,292
(electronic beeping)

1194
01:16:22,292 --> 01:16:25,170
(David breathing heavily)

1195
01:16:25,170 --> 01:16:27,120
- [David] Oh shit, level one's blocked.

1196
01:16:33,050 --> 01:16:34,356
- Where the hell are you going?

1197
01:16:34,356 --> 01:16:35,189
- I'm going to check on Robin.

1198
01:16:35,189 --> 01:16:36,580
Seal the door when I leave.

1199
01:16:36,580 --> 01:16:37,420
- Kyle, don't.

1200
01:16:37,420 --> 01:16:40,270
- I'm not leaving her alone,
not with that thing up here.

1201
01:16:42,456 --> 01:16:47,456
(Kyle groaning)
(mutant screeching)

1202
01:16:47,818 --> 01:16:49,235
- Close, damn it!

1203
01:16:50,284 --> 01:16:53,034
(Kara screaming)

1204
01:16:55,764 --> 01:16:58,345
(Kara groaning)

1205
01:16:58,345 --> 01:17:01,178
(dramatic music)

1206
01:17:09,230 --> 01:17:14,230
(dog whistle blowing)
(mutant screeching)

1207
01:17:55,424 --> 01:17:56,257
- No!

1208
01:17:57,679 --> 01:17:58,512
No!

1209
01:17:58,512 --> 01:18:01,429
(glass shattering)

1210
01:18:04,721 --> 01:18:05,725
- Come to papa.

1211
01:18:05,725 --> 01:18:08,337
(flare gun firing)
(mutant screeching)

1212
01:18:08,337 --> 01:18:11,504
(electricity buzzing)

1213
01:18:15,470 --> 01:18:20,470
(knife clattering)
(David groaning)

1214
01:18:21,040 --> 01:18:22,114
- Stop!

1215
01:18:22,114 --> 01:18:24,010
Stop right there!

1216
01:18:24,010 --> 01:18:25,047
Don't hurt him!

1217
01:18:28,927 --> 01:18:30,460
You're part of him...

1218
01:18:35,400 --> 01:18:36,300
You're part of me.

1219
01:18:37,660 --> 01:18:40,367
Don't you feel that?

1220
01:18:40,367 --> 01:18:42,190
You understand, don't you?

1221
01:18:44,080 --> 01:18:46,210
You don't want to hurt us.

1222
01:18:46,210 --> 01:18:47,043
That's bad.

1223
01:18:49,316 --> 01:18:50,233
It's wrong.

1224
01:18:56,490 --> 01:18:58,503
Just listen to the sound of my voice.

1225
01:19:00,009 --> 01:19:03,290
Shh, that's it...

1226
01:19:03,290 --> 01:19:04,673
Just focus on my voice.

1227
01:19:07,170 --> 01:19:09,123
Fight the killer inside of you.

1228
01:19:10,752 --> 01:19:12,252
You can do it.

1229
01:19:12,252 --> 01:19:15,047
You can do it.
(mutant whimpering)

1230
01:19:15,047 --> 01:19:16,214
You can do it.

1231
01:19:22,792 --> 01:19:25,709
(mutant screaming)

1232
01:19:31,393 --> 01:19:34,060
(Ariel sobbing)

1233
01:19:42,157 --> 01:19:44,907
(dramatic music)

1234
01:19:46,974 --> 01:19:51,437
(explosion booming)
(Ariel screaming)

1235
01:19:51,437 --> 01:19:56,437
(beastly growling)
(David groaning)

1236
01:20:04,726 --> 01:20:05,559
- No!

1237
01:20:09,362 --> 01:20:10,195
No!

1238
01:20:12,732 --> 01:20:13,791
David!

1239
01:20:13,791 --> 01:20:17,080
(dramatic music)

1240
01:20:17,080 --> 01:20:17,913
David, no!

1241
01:20:19,457 --> 01:20:22,624
(electricity buzzing)

1242
01:20:35,819 --> 01:20:40,819
(dramatic music)
(both breathing heavily)

1243
01:20:43,153 --> 01:20:45,236
- It's gotta be over now.

1244
01:20:48,810 --> 01:20:50,110
- I think somehow it knew.

1245
01:20:51,353 --> 01:20:53,493
Part of it sensed there was a connection.

1246
01:20:56,100 --> 01:20:58,320
- Must take after your side of the family.

1247
01:21:04,920 --> 01:21:06,380
- [Robin] Oh my God...

1248
01:21:19,583 --> 01:21:21,995
- [David] Everything's secure now.

1249
01:21:21,995 --> 01:21:23,793
Let's get you to med bay, can you make it?

1250
01:21:23,793 --> 01:21:25,376
- Yeah, I think so.

1251
01:21:26,657 --> 01:21:27,490
Come on.

1252
01:21:39,495 --> 01:21:42,328
(dramatic music)
