00:30:46,647 --> 00:30:50,018
[Tommy] Come on, Henry. Look,
Barb weighs, like, 60 pounds.

675
00:30:50,183 --> 00:30:51,986
You can't let her
push you around like that.

676
00:30:52,085 --> 00:30:55,088
[grunts]
Why don't you push her around?

677
00:30:56,156 --> 00:31:00,527
Man down, man down!
Game over, Ackerman. [laughs]

678
00:31:00,661 --> 00:31:02,663
Looks like the Ackermans
have lost a player.

679
00:31:03,463 --> 00:31:05,599
Unfortunately, that means
that there's a forfeit,

680
00:31:05,767 --> 00:31:06,935
Sanders win.

681
00:31:07,167 --> 00:31:08,679
- [audience cheers]
- [Eddie] We are the champions!

682
00:31:08,703 --> 00:31:09,871
[cheers]

683
00:31:09,971 --> 00:31:12,272
What? Come on.

684
00:31:12,439 --> 00:31:14,408
- [upbeat music playing]
- Sorry.

685
00:31:17,745 --> 00:31:23,083
[indistinct chatter]

686
00:31:26,721 --> 00:31:28,756
- Hey, you guys.
- Hey!

687
00:31:28,856 --> 00:31:31,191
Wow, those look great.

688
00:31:31,291 --> 00:31:34,561
I know, it's kind of cheesy,
but I love it so much.

689
00:31:34,661 --> 00:31:36,229
[both laugh]

690
00:31:37,065 --> 00:31:39,666
Are you painting
with mayonnaise?

691
00:31:40,300 --> 00:31:42,402
[mild tempo music playing]

692
00:31:43,004 --> 00:31:44,872
Hey, guys,
let's go wash up, okay?

693
00:31:45,138 --> 00:31:46,616
Daddy's about done
with his prayer walk

694
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:47,674
in the woods.

695
00:31:48,141 --> 00:31:50,210
You guys, first year at camp.

696
00:31:50,577 --> 00:31:52,512
You get to do the craft
for new families.

697
00:31:52,646 --> 00:31:54,548
[squeals] Hold on.

698
00:31:55,616 --> 00:31:58,820
Okay, you're gonna love it.
Here we go.

699
00:31:59,519 --> 00:32:02,456
Okay, so first, what you do
is you count down

700
00:32:02,556 --> 00:32:03,756
the number of days until Henry

701
00:32:03,791 --> 00:32:05,626
and Hannah graduate
from high school.

702
00:32:05,827 --> 00:32:07,327
- Okay.
- Then, together,

703
00:32:07,729 --> 00:32:09,731
count the same number
of beads...

704
00:32:10,564 --> 00:32:11,899
and you put them in the jar.

705
00:32:12,265 --> 00:32:16,004
Then, every day,
you just take one out.

706
00:32:16,436 --> 00:32:19,040
Every day, take one out.

707
00:32:19,774 --> 00:32:23,878
You know,
just every day, take one out...

708
00:32:25,847 --> 00:32:27,381
'cause the days, you know.

709
00:32:29,349 --> 00:32:30,517
Such a great reminder

710
00:32:30,617 --> 00:32:32,653
of how precious
your time is together.

711
00:32:33,755 --> 00:32:37,624
Is this some sort of cruel joke?
[chuckles]

712
00:32:38,158 --> 00:32:39,693
- Grace.
- No?

713
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:41,528
No,

714
00:32:41,695 --> 00:32:43,895
you know, you only have, what?
Two years left with them?

715
00:32:44,264 --> 00:32:47,969
[sighs] This vase, these beads,

716
00:32:48,468 --> 00:32:50,170
they're gonna make
everyday count.

717
00:32:52,140 --> 00:32:53,407
Do the beads.

718
00:32:54,207 --> 00:32:55,475
There you go.

719
00:32:56,110 --> 00:32:58,178
[mild tempo music playing]

720
00:32:58,278 --> 00:32:59,513
- Okay.
- Okay.

721
00:32:59,847 --> 00:33:00,882
There you go.

722
00:33:00,982 --> 00:33:02,215
[both] Thank you.

723
00:33:03,183 --> 00:33:05,185
- Come on, let's go. [laughs]
- [laughs]

724
00:33:06,353 --> 00:33:08,455
Hey, bud,
what happened out there today?

725
00:33:08,622 --> 00:33:10,557
I mean, I really thought
we had a good chance

726
00:33:10,657 --> 00:33:13,326
- to win bubble ball.
- Meh, I just don't like sports.

727
00:33:13,861 --> 00:33:17,364
I... I know, but if
you put forth some effort,

728
00:33:17,698 --> 00:33:20,001
uh, you might find
a sport you like.

729
00:33:20,168 --> 00:33:21,435
Like what, golf?

730
00:33:21,736 --> 00:33:24,014
Yeah, maybe you and I could
go out sometime to the course?

731
00:33:24,038 --> 00:33:25,205
- No.
- Okay.

732
00:33:25,305 --> 00:33:26,673
[Henry] Can you get me
a snow cone?

733
00:33:26,974 --> 00:33:27,975
Yeah.

734
00:33:28,375 --> 00:33:32,212
- [soft music playing]
- [sighs]

735
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:35,415
[Henry] Here,
in the Amazon rainforest,

736
00:33:35,582 --> 00:33:38,953
it's home to a number
of species,

737
00:33:39,087 --> 00:33:42,322
such as snakes, tigers,

738
00:33:42,556 --> 00:33:45,525
and what I'm gonna soon find,
bigfoots.

739
00:33:46,994 --> 00:33:48,129
What do we have here?

740
00:33:48,295 --> 00:33:49,539
- [Eddie] It's okay.
- It just makes me sad

741
00:33:49,563 --> 00:33:51,108
that my parents immigrated
all the way here

742
00:33:51,132 --> 00:33:52,275
- just to have our...
- Oh, yes,

743
00:33:52,299 --> 00:33:53,609
let's bring
your parents into this.

744
00:33:53,633 --> 00:33:55,703
Nothing more fun
than fighting with four people.

745
00:33:55,970 --> 00:33:57,171
[Barb] What are you doing?

746
00:33:57,437 --> 00:34:00,540
Nothing, I'm just trying
to catch a big foot on camera.

747
00:34:00,674 --> 00:34:02,710
Don't be a dummy, our dad said

748
00:34:02,810 --> 00:34:05,213
that Noah wouldn't let bigfoots
get on the ark

749
00:34:05,412 --> 00:34:07,581
because they smelled like feet.

750
00:34:07,849 --> 00:34:11,219
Yeah, dummy, why else
do you think there's no big foot

751
00:34:11,318 --> 00:34:14,488
in any of Noah's Ark's
coloring books, huh?

752
00:34:15,355 --> 00:34:18,092
Touché,
clearly I'm the real dummy.

753
00:34:18,258 --> 00:34:19,392
Mm-hmm.

754
00:34:19,693 --> 00:34:21,237
[Eddie] What does...
What does that look even mean?

755
00:34:21,261 --> 00:34:22,295
Why does it always...

756
00:34:22,395 --> 00:34:25,699
[cheerful music playing]

757
00:34:34,008 --> 00:34:36,944
[indistinct chatter]

758
00:34:37,044 --> 00:34:39,479
[exhales] Getting pretty close
to the flame there, bucko,

759
00:34:39,579 --> 00:34:41,348
unless you prefer
charred mellows.

760
00:34:41,448 --> 00:34:42,950
You know,
I wasn't gonna say anything,

761
00:34:43,050 --> 00:34:44,786
but, uh, I'm pretty sure s'mores

762
00:34:44,886 --> 00:34:47,021
aren't on the What Would
Jesus Eat diet.

763
00:34:47,121 --> 00:34:49,724
Hey, we're not monsters, okay?

764
00:34:49,924 --> 00:34:52,927
This is a very important
camp experience for our kids.

765
00:34:53,795 --> 00:34:56,097
Even though we do make
sugar-free, organic,

766
00:34:56,197 --> 00:34:57,765
vegan, non-dairy marshmallows.

767
00:34:57,865 --> 00:35:01,434
Oh, I'd expect nothing
but perfection from you, Eddie.

768
00:35:01,535 --> 00:35:05,206
[chuckles] Whoa, somebody
call the fire department,

769
00:35:05,305 --> 00:35:07,607
look at that. [laughs]

770
00:35:16,616 --> 00:35:18,618
[grunts]

771
00:35:26,127 --> 00:35:27,436
Hey, Dad, will you film me
tearing

772
00:35:27,460 --> 00:35:28,628
this big ol' s'more down?

773
00:35:28,729 --> 00:35:30,131
Uh, yeah, buddy, let's do that.

774
00:35:30,231 --> 00:35:32,311
Let's go right over here,
way over here by the boats.

775
00:35:32,365 --> 00:35:34,001
Ooh! Mm-mm.

776
00:35:35,303 --> 00:35:37,038
Okay, uh, let me see.

777
00:35:37,604 --> 00:35:39,240
All right, how does this work?

778
00:35:39,439 --> 00:35:42,509
[camera trills]

779
00:35:44,578 --> 00:35:46,413
Hmm. Bon appétit, kiddos.

780
00:35:47,982 --> 00:35:48,983
[Barb sniffs]

781
00:35:49,482 --> 00:35:50,684
[chuckles]

782
00:35:52,086 --> 00:35:53,087
- [camera beeps]
- Okay.

783
00:35:53,187 --> 00:35:54,322
Okay, here I go!

784
00:35:54,421 --> 00:35:55,661
[Victoria] <i>It just makes me sad</i>

785
00:35:55,689 --> 00:35:56,934
<i>- that my parents immigrated...</i>
- Nope.

786
00:35:56,958 --> 00:35:58,367
<i>- ...all way here.</i>
- [Eddie] <i>Oh, yeah,</i>

787
00:35:58,391 --> 00:35:59,736
<i>let's bring your parents
into this.</i>

788
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:01,796
<i>Nothing more fun
than fighting with four people.</i>

789
00:36:02,296 --> 00:36:03,563
[camera beeps]

790
00:36:05,900 --> 00:36:08,736
Oh, uh, hey, bud,
let's... let's, uh,

791
00:36:08,836 --> 00:36:10,304
let's do... do it again, okay?

792
00:36:10,437 --> 00:36:12,306
[mumbling]

793
00:36:12,472 --> 00:36:13,851
No, I know,
I know, I just... I think

794
00:36:13,875 --> 00:36:15,418
- you got a better one in you.
- [spits]

795
00:36:15,442 --> 00:36:17,544
Why is nothing I do
ever good enough for you?

796
00:36:17,745 --> 00:36:20,680
No, no, let's just... let's just
give it another shot, okay?

797
00:36:23,683 --> 00:36:24,684
Henry!

798
00:36:28,455 --> 00:36:31,926
- Hmm, hmm.
- [indistinct chatter]

799
00:36:35,897 --> 00:36:36,931
[sighs]

800
00:36:37,031 --> 00:36:40,935
[ukulele playing]

801
00:36:41,202 --> 00:36:42,535
You know, I still can't believe

802
00:36:42,669 --> 00:36:44,789
that the prettiest girl
at camp has never been kissed.

803
00:36:45,072 --> 00:36:47,742
Well, what,
why is that so hard to believe?

804
00:36:47,842 --> 00:36:51,611
I mean, it's cool, I'm sure
you'll find the right guy.

805
00:36:54,248 --> 00:36:56,250
[ukulele playing]

806
00:36:56,350 --> 00:36:58,819
[Hannah] Um, okay.

807
00:37:00,487 --> 00:37:01,956
- [Tommy] Hey.
- Hey.

808
00:37:02,256 --> 00:37:06,160
- [sighs]
- Tommy Ackerman.

809
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:08,296
[laughs]

810
00:37:08,896 --> 00:37:12,266
Did you know
you are the only one

811
00:37:12,632 --> 00:37:14,735
who hasn't signed up
for the Daddy Day Hike?

812
00:37:15,102 --> 00:37:17,805
Oh, you should go.

813
00:37:19,572 --> 00:37:21,842
I would, but, uh, you know what?

814
00:37:22,243 --> 00:37:24,745
The, uh, only reason I came
to camp was just to get to spend

815
00:37:24,845 --> 00:37:26,047
more time with my family.

816
00:37:26,147 --> 00:37:27,827
Well, that's exactly
why you need to do it.

817
00:37:28,115 --> 00:37:30,217
See, all the dads hike up
to Mount Burrow.

818
00:37:30,450 --> 00:37:31,852
They gather by themselves and...

819
00:37:31,953 --> 00:37:34,956
- [soft music playing]
- ...listen to God.

820
00:37:39,060 --> 00:37:40,060
Sign him up.

821
00:37:40,127 --> 00:37:41,996
Excellent!
[chuckles] It's the best thing

822
00:37:42,096 --> 00:37:43,831
you're gonna do
for your family all week.

823
00:37:44,464 --> 00:37:47,768
You're awesome.
[laughs] All right, Johnsons?

824
00:37:48,202 --> 00:37:49,403
[Mr. Johnson] Hey, what's up?

825
00:37:49,502 --> 00:37:51,182
[sighs] I really don't know
about that guy.

826
00:37:51,272 --> 00:37:55,009
I know, I think he spent
way too much time at camp.

827
00:37:55,608 --> 00:37:58,346
What? Oh, no, no, no, not him.

828
00:37:58,678 --> 00:38:00,414
I mean,
Justin Bieber over there.

829
00:38:00,715 --> 00:38:02,149
- [Tommy] That?
- [Grace] Yeah.

830
00:38:02,249 --> 00:38:04,952
That's just a camp fling.
She'll be over him in a week.

831
00:38:06,354 --> 00:38:07,355
[sighs]

832
00:38:08,122 --> 00:38:09,857
You know, maybe
you should go on this hike,

833
00:38:09,957 --> 00:38:11,759
spend a little more time
with Eddie.

834
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:14,228
What?

835
00:38:14,694 --> 00:38:17,164
He just puts a lot
into his family,

836
00:38:17,298 --> 00:38:18,631
- and...
- Oh, come on.

837
00:38:18,733 --> 00:38:22,069
You minimize things,
you know, "Oh, she'll be fine."

838
00:38:22,770 --> 00:38:23,904
You're gonna do this, right?

839
00:38:24,005 --> 00:38:26,207
This... this is why
I came over here,

840
00:38:26,606 --> 00:38:29,143
so that you could compare me
to Eddie Sanders?

841
00:38:29,243 --> 00:38:31,212
Oh, yeah, he's just...
he's just the perfect man.

842
00:38:31,345 --> 00:38:32,555
He's a much better dad than me,

843
00:38:32,579 --> 00:38:33,613
- he's...
- No, no, Tommy,

844
00:38:33,714 --> 00:38:35,116

00:46:43,303 --> 00:46:45,539
Yeah, thanks, I'm coming down.

1015
00:46:48,475 --> 00:46:50,344
Oh, thank God.

1016
00:46:51,044 --> 00:46:53,580
- He's a good kid.
- Yeah, yeah.

1017
00:46:55,315 --> 00:46:56,683
Remind me your name again.

1018
00:46:57,384 --> 00:47:00,487
- Tommy, we go to your church.
- Yes.

1019
00:47:01,655 --> 00:47:05,158
- Golfer, right?
- Uh, yeah, yeah, sorry.

1020
00:47:05,259 --> 00:47:07,060
I think I've been showing up
a little late.

1021
00:47:07,327 --> 00:47:08,767
No, it's all good.
Seeing you come in

1022
00:47:08,863 --> 00:47:11,074
reminds me I only have a minute
or two left in the sermon.

1023
00:47:11,098 --> 00:47:15,202
[chuckles] Well, I deserve that.

1024
00:47:16,069 --> 00:47:18,806
- Hey, can I be honest with you?
- [Dave] Sure.

1025
00:47:18,973 --> 00:47:22,744
Yeah, um, I think God
and I are good.

1026
00:47:23,210 --> 00:47:25,679
He and I are okay.
Uh, it's just, uh...

1027
00:47:26,848 --> 00:47:28,950
I'm busy,
there's a lot going on,

1028
00:47:29,182 --> 00:47:31,585
and, uh,
church is just another thing

1029
00:47:31,685 --> 00:47:32,685
on my list.

1030
00:47:33,320 --> 00:47:36,356
Hmm. No judgements here.

1031
00:47:37,457 --> 00:47:39,928
See, it doesn't matter
if you're... if you're old

1032
00:47:40,028 --> 00:47:41,094
or if you're young.

1033
00:47:41,628 --> 00:47:44,631
We are all in different spots
in our journey with God.

1034
00:47:45,065 --> 00:47:47,501
- Yeah.
- Hey, Tommy, you...

1035
00:47:48,870 --> 00:47:50,103
you know what a compass does?

1036
00:47:50,437 --> 00:47:52,072
[Tommy]
It tells you where to go?

1037
00:47:52,339 --> 00:47:55,810
Not exactly, it turns out
it only has one basic function.

1038
00:47:56,543 --> 00:47:58,713
A compass points you
to true north,

1039
00:47:59,313 --> 00:48:02,416
and once you got true north,
you can never get lost.

1040
00:48:03,216 --> 00:48:07,120
Since we're being honest,
I'm your pastor.

1041
00:48:08,121 --> 00:48:10,624
But it's not my job
or the church's job

1042
00:48:11,059 --> 00:48:12,492
to lead your family...

1043
00:48:13,660 --> 00:48:14,661
it's yours.

1044
00:48:15,930 --> 00:48:19,767
See, life can pull you
in many different directions

1045
00:48:19,867 --> 00:48:22,169
if you let it, but real talk...

1046
00:48:22,269 --> 00:48:23,670
[soft music playing]

1047
00:48:23,805 --> 00:48:27,307
...it's pretty easy to get lost
if you don't have a guide.

1048
00:48:31,079 --> 00:48:33,280
- Have fun out here.
- Yeah.

1049
00:48:43,190 --> 00:48:44,458
[Eddie] <i>Sanders family,</i>

1050
00:48:44,558 --> 00:48:46,526
<i>I am proud of you
and all the hustle today.</i>

1051
00:48:46,627 --> 00:48:49,630
<i>We destroyed so many families
on the field of battle,</i>

1052
00:48:49,731 --> 00:48:52,399
<i>including the Ackermans
in most events.</i>

1053
00:48:52,499 --> 00:48:55,135
<i>I know the good Lord
is so pleased with us.</i>

1054
00:48:55,235 --> 00:48:56,536
[crickets chirping]

1055
00:48:56,637 --> 00:48:58,138
- [Tommy] <i>Eddie?</i>
- [Eddie] <i>Mm-hmm?</i>

1056
00:48:58,238 --> 00:48:59,640
[Tommy] <i>We can hear you.</i>

1057
00:49:00,108 --> 00:49:01,709
[owl hooting]

1058
00:49:01,809 --> 00:49:04,946
[Barb] <i>Oh, no,</i>
<i>Little Billy Graham is gone.</i>

1059
00:49:05,046 --> 00:49:06,546
[Tommy]
<i>Who's Little Billy Graham?</i>

1060
00:49:06,647 --> 00:49:09,884
[Eddie] <i>Nobody panic,</i>
<i>he's just the smaller gerbil.</i>

1061
00:49:09,984 --> 00:49:10,984
[Grace] <i>What?</i>

1062
00:49:11,052 --> 00:49:13,520
[indistinct chatter]

1063
00:49:14,221 --> 00:49:15,555
[Joel] <i>Gentlemen, welcome</i>

1064
00:49:15,656 --> 00:49:17,457
<i>to the Ouachita National Forest,</i>

1065
00:49:17,557 --> 00:49:19,259
<i>One-point-eight million acres</i>

1066
00:49:19,359 --> 00:49:21,996
<i>across two states.
So in light of that,</i>

1067
00:49:22,096 --> 00:49:24,498
today we are gonna do
the buddy system.

1068
00:49:24,799 --> 00:49:26,901
That means no one goes
anywhere without their buddy.

1069
00:49:27,001 --> 00:49:28,277
-Mm-hmm
-So go ahead and pair up.

1070
00:49:28,301 --> 00:49:30,838
[indistinct chatter]

1071
00:49:32,707 --> 00:49:34,942
[Joel] Now, Eddie Sanders
has volunteered

1072
00:49:35,043 --> 00:49:36,176
to be the caboose

1073
00:49:36,410 --> 00:49:38,210
so that we can keep
the entire group together.

1074
00:49:38,345 --> 00:49:40,114
Eddie, who's your lucky buddy?

1075
00:49:40,247 --> 00:49:42,616
That would be my yurt made,
Tommy Ackerman.

1076
00:49:42,717 --> 00:49:45,652
Oh, no, sorry,
Pastor Dave and I were, um...

1077
00:49:46,253 --> 00:49:49,256
- [chuckles]
- Not on the same page

1078
00:49:50,925 --> 00:49:51,965
All right, let's head out.

1079
00:49:54,762 --> 00:49:55,963
[sighs] Let's go, bucko.

1080
00:49:56,396 --> 00:49:58,632
Yeah, did you pack enough
for a day hike?

1081
00:49:58,933 --> 00:50:00,643
Well, it's a little light
for an Eagle Scout,

1082
00:50:00,667 --> 00:50:03,071
but if we get lost,
the good Lord always provides.

1083
00:50:03,171 --> 00:50:05,106
Am I right? I'm right.

1084
00:50:05,338 --> 00:50:08,009
[harmonica playing]

1085
00:50:08,109 --> 00:50:09,309
[Tommy sighs]

1086
00:50:20,387 --> 00:50:27,561
[soft music playing]

1087
00:50:32,432 --> 00:50:35,737
[indistinct chatter]

1088
00:50:39,306 --> 00:50:41,976
I have an offer for you,
free of charge.

1089
00:50:42,275 --> 00:50:44,145
I know it's gonna sound
too good to be true,

1090
00:50:44,244 --> 00:50:45,780
but I can't help it, I like you.

1091
00:50:45,880 --> 00:50:48,615
[sniffs] It's starting to smell
like a pyramid scheme.

1092
00:50:48,716 --> 00:50:49,716
Oh, heavens no.

1093
00:50:49,851 --> 00:50:51,819
The essential oils
are my wife's department.

1094
00:50:52,452 --> 00:50:54,222
Nay, nay, nay,
what the good Lord laid

1095
00:50:54,321 --> 00:50:58,558
upon my heart is for you
to have some mentors hip

1096
00:50:59,259 --> 00:51:02,029
in parenting with me.

1097
00:51:02,864 --> 00:51:04,966
[chuckles] It'll be the best
five years of your life.

1098
00:51:05,298 --> 00:51:06,898
People don't call me
the mentoring Miyagi

1099
00:51:06,968 --> 00:51:08,069
- for nothing.
- Mm-hmm.

1100
00:51:08,169 --> 00:51:10,204
Name one person
who calls you Miyagi.

1101
00:51:10,303 --> 00:51:12,639
Alto, you stay right here
and think about it.

1102
00:51:12,740 --> 00:51:14,842
I'm gonna hop off the trail
to the little boy's room.

1103
00:51:15,743 --> 00:51:17,011
Okay, hey.

1104
00:51:17,677 --> 00:51:19,714
Hurry up,
I don't want to get left behind.

1105
00:51:20,380 --> 00:51:22,750
[Eddie] Ah, I don't want
to get bit by any bugs.

1106
00:51:22,850 --> 00:51:24,752
Oops, that's poison ivy.

1107
00:51:26,154 --> 00:51:28,923
Come on, come on. [sighs]

1108
00:51:40,868 --> 00:51:44,371
- [whistles]
- Aha.

1109
00:51:45,072 --> 00:51:46,841
Sweet manna from heaven.

1110
00:51:46,941 --> 00:51:48,308
[mild tempo music playing]

1111
00:51:48,408 --> 00:51:49,643
[bees buzzing]

1112
00:51:49,744 --> 00:51:53,781
Daddy's bringing home
the honey. [chuckles]

1113
00:51:57,118 --> 00:52:00,387
[Eddie screaming]

1114
00:52:02,389 --> 00:52:06,194
[Eddie] Run, run!

1115
00:52:06,294 --> 00:52:07,460
[whimpers]

1116
00:52:07,728 --> 00:52:10,832
- Get that thing away from me!
- My skin is on fire!

1117
00:52:11,531 --> 00:52:14,334
- Get away from me!
- [Eddie screams] It's free!

1118
00:52:14,668 --> 00:52:15,748
- Get rid of it!
- [screams]

1119
00:52:15,803 --> 00:52:19,841
It's free organic honey!
[screams]

1120
00:52:22,642 --> 00:52:25,612
- [Eddie whimpers]
- That's a co-pay.

1121
00:52:26,247 --> 00:52:31,819
[both scream, pant]

1122
00:52:35,189 --> 00:52:37,390
[both pant]

1123
00:52:37,490 --> 00:52:40,962
Man, my face stings so bad.

1124
00:52:42,930 --> 00:52:44,364
Do you see anything?

1125
00:52:45,299 --> 00:52:47,601
No, no, I don't, mm-mm, no.

1126
00:52:47,701 --> 00:52:49,369
You look... you look good.
You look good.

1127
00:52:49,536 --> 00:52:53,107
Oh, praise God, I prayed
for a hedge of protection

1128
00:52:53,741 --> 00:52:57,845
and the good Lord
always comes through every time.

1129
00:52:57,979 --> 00:53:02,649
Um, yeah, if you stop breathing,
just say something, okay?

1130
00:53:02,750 --> 00:53:05,219
- Ten-four. [breathes deeply]
- Okay, great, great, great.

1131
00:53:05,319 --> 00:53:07,654
- Hey, um, that, uh...
- [Eddie gasps]

1132
00:53:07,755 --> 00:53:09,456
...that fort back there,
I was thinking...

1133
00:53:09,556 --> 00:53:13,660
- [both groan]
- [suspenseful music playing]

1134
00:53:15,029 --> 00:53:17,430
Eddie! Eddie, Eddie?

1135
00:53:17,530 --> 00:53:20,368
Quick, give me a shot
of epinephrine in my pouch.

1136
00:53:20,600 --> 00:53:22,837
[Tommy] Geez, how much stuff
you got... Oh, found it.

1137
00:53:22,970 --> 00:53:24,105
Okay, hold on...

1138
00:53:24,238 --> 00:53:25,572
Okay, now what?

1139
00:53:25,672 --> 00:53:28,276
Before you stab me,
you need to massage my thigh.

1140
00:53:28,408 --> 00:53:31,645
- Um, nope.
- Do you want me to die?

1141
00:53:32,046 --> 00:53:33,046
Hmm, well...

1142
00:53:33,080 --> 00:53:34,681
You have to massage my leg
in the spot

1143
00:53:34,782 --> 00:53:36,727
where you're gonna stab me
in for at least ten seconds

1144
00:53:36,751 --> 00:53:39,220
- or it does not work.
- Okay. [groans]

1145
00:53:39,320 --> 00:53:43,224
- [groans]
- [Eddie whimpers]

1146
00:53:43,623 --> 00:53:45,525
Oh, oh, that feels kind of nice.

1147
00:53:45,760 --> 00:53:47,694
- Please stop talking.
- [whimpers, pants]

1148
00:53:47,862 --> 00:53:49,663
Okay, uh, you might want to,
I don't know,

1149
00:53:49,797 --> 00:53:51,708
- say a prayer or something.
- [Eddie] Okay, all right,

1150
00:53:51,732 --> 00:53:53,000
let me grab my keys.

1151
00:53:53,401 --> 00:53:59,073
[both scream]

1152
00:53:59,907 --> 00:54:02,076
- My hand! [groans]
- You put in there!

1153
00:54:02,609 --> 00:54:04,312
[gasps, pants]

1154
00:54:04,412 --> 00:54:05,679
- Do it again.
- Again?

1155
00:54:05,813 --> 00:54:08,182
You have to stab me
in the legs or the buttocks

1156
00:54:08,282 --> 00:54:09,549
or it does not work.

1157
00:54:10,184 --> 00:54:12,720
The legs it is,
let me dust this off real quick.

1158
00:54:12,820 --> 00:54:14,587
No, no, no,
I have a second pen in here.

1159
00:54:14,789 --> 00:54:16,556
- [gasps]
- Of course you do.

1160
00:54:17,524 --> 00:54:19,492
- Oh, hey. [groans, whimpers]
- Okay, okay.

1161
00:54:19,727 --> 00:54:21,461
- I'm starting to see Heaven.
- No.

1162
00:54:21,796 --> 00:54:23,965
Hey, hey,
Uncle Roy, is that you?

1163
00:54:24,265 --> 00:54:25,866
Do you still make
those flapjacks?

1164
00:54:26,033 --> 00:54:28,135
I want some flapjacks,
Uncle Roy.

1165
00:54:28,269 --> 00:54:30,537
- No, tell Roy to go away.
- Make it big flapjacks,

1166
00:54:30,637 --> 00:54:32,197
- Uncle Roy.
- No, no, don't take those.

1167
00:54:32,273 --> 00:54:33,708
Melt that butter, Uncle Roy.

1168
00:54:33,841 --> 00:54:35,575
Don't. You tell Roy to get away.

1169
00:54:35,675 --> 00:54:38,846
Roy, get away!
The kitchen's closed.

1170
00:54:39,146 --> 00:54:42,817
[screams]

1171
00:54:44,151 --> 00:54:46,619
[indistinct chatter]

1172
00:54:48,222 --> 00:54:49,223
Hmm.

1173
00:54:50,358 --> 00:54:52,193
- Huh?
- [pants]

1174
00:54:52,793 --> 00:54:55,396
- Wow, that thing works fast.
- [chuckles]

1175
00:54:55,495 --> 00:54:57,865
Yeah, that is pure adrenalin,
my friend.

1176
00:54:58,399 --> 00:55:00,676
- [mild tempo music playing]
- Hey, I want to go for a run.

1177
00:55:00,700 --> 00:55:01,902
You want to go for a run?

1178
00:55:02,003 --> 00:55:03,704
I want to go for one,
let's go for a run!

1179
00:55:03,804 --> 00:55:05,084
Okay, hot pants,
why don't you...

1180
00:55:05,172 --> 00:55:06,573
Come on! [yelps]

1181
00:55:09,377 --> 00:55:10,577
[sighs]

1182
00:55:14,681 --> 00:55:16,717
[Grace] Uh, finally,
some mother daughter time...

1183
00:55:16,851 --> 00:55:19,820
- Okay, okay, careful, Mom.
- [Grace] Ooh, that is slippery.

1184
00:55:20,187 --> 00:55:22,589
[Hannah] All right, okay,
Mom, okay, Mom.

1185
00:55:22,689 --> 00:55:23,800
[Grace] Just whatever you do,

1186
00:55:23,824 --> 00:55:24,968
- don't let go.
- [Hannah] Okay.

1187
00:55:24,992 --> 00:55:26,727
- [Corbin] Hey, there.
- Oh, hey.

1188
00:55:27,028 --> 00:55:28,029
[screams]

1189
00:55:29,096 --> 00:55:32,933
- Want to toss the 'bee around?
- Yeah, sure. Um, hey, Mom?

1190
00:55:33,834 --> 00:55:34,835
Mom?

1191
00:55:35,436 --> 00:55:36,771
[dramatic music playing]

1192
00:55:36,871 --> 00:55:39,874
Oh, okay, is it cool
if I go hang with Corbin?

1193
00:55:42,977 --> 00:55:44,577
- Thanks.
- [Corbin] After you.

1194
00:55:44,677 --> 00:55:47,381
Thank you, so how have you been?

1195
00:55:47,481 --> 00:55:49,050
[Corbin] Uh, yeah, pretty good.

1196
00:55:49,150 --> 00:55:53,653
[Grace grunts] Come on,
come on, God.

1197
00:55:54,989 --> 00:55:56,123
I'm good.

1198
00:55:58,059 --> 00:55:59,060
[snorts]

1199
00:56:01,395 --> 00:56:02,629
[snorts]

1200
00:56:05,766 --> 00:56:06,967
- Hey.
- Hmm?

1201
00:56:08,668 --> 00:56:10,304
- Were you tickling my face?
- [scoffs]

1202
00:56:10,670 --> 00:56:13,040
Yeah, I was,
I tried shaking you violently,

1203
00:56:13,140 --> 00:56:15,910
but all that did
was make me feel good.

1204
00:56:19,313 --> 00:56:20,881
[sighs] That's the way.

1205
00:56:20,981 --> 00:56:23,918
[mild tempo music playing]

1206
00:56:24,018 --> 00:56:26,754
[Tommy] That is not a trail.

1207
00:56:34,228 --> 00:56:36,730
[Eddie] The trail winds
to the left up there quite a bit

1208
00:56:37,198 --> 00:56:38,665
and I'm 100% positive

1209
00:56:38,766 --> 00:56:40,201
that if we cut through
these woods,

1210
00:56:40,301 --> 00:56:42,669
we will find ourselves
back on the trail

1211
00:56:42,903 --> 00:56:45,206
and probably ahead of the group.

1212
00:56:46,540 --> 00:56:47,908
[sighs]

1213
00:56:49,210 --> 00:56:50,244
[sighs]

1214
00:56:51,879 --> 00:56:54,681
Hey, buddy, come on. [chuckles]

1215
00:56:54,982 --> 00:56:57,251
This is our story
to tell our wives,

1216
00:56:57,351 --> 00:56:58,719
how we braved the wilderness

1217
00:56:58,819 --> 00:57:02,089
and fought our way back home.
[grunts]

1218
00:57:09,296 --> 00:57:10,297
Come on.

1219
00:57:12,800 --> 00:57:14,768
Come on. [whistles]

1220
00:57:16,504 --> 00:57:17,538
Come, come.

1221
00:57:18,072 --> 00:57:20,941
Okay, but quit talking to me
like I'm a dog.

1222
00:57:21,041 --> 00:57:22,710
- [Eddie] Good boy, Tommy.
- Stop it.

1223
00:57:23,144 --> 00:57:28,681
Eight, ten, twelve, fourteen,
sixteen, eighteen...

1224
00:57:30,751 --> 00:57:32,186
Has anyone seen Tommy or Eddie?

1225
00:57:33,020 --> 00:57:37,258
- [confused chatter]
- Tommy, Eddie?

1226
00:57:42,329 --> 00:57:43,330
Oh, no.

1227
00:57:43,497 --> 00:57:46,867
[bird cawing]

1228
00:57:49,737 --> 00:57:50,738
[Tommy groaning]

1229
00:57:51,438 --> 00:57:53,374
I should have known better
than to trust you.

1230
00:57:53,574 --> 00:57:55,342
You have no idea where we are.

1231
00:57:55,442 --> 00:57:56,676
Well, good luck crossing that.

1232
00:57:56,777 --> 00:57:58,512
[Eddie] I've crossed it
a dozen times.

1233
00:57:59,046 --> 00:58:01,415
That, you've crossed that?

1234
00:58:05,519 --> 00:58:06,720
Things like it.

1235
00:58:07,588 --> 00:58:11,158
[mild tempo music playing]

1236
00:58:12,726 --> 00:58:16,096
[Eddie] Mentorship tip
numero uno,

1237
00:58:16,530 --> 00:58:17,965
never ask your kids
to do something

1238
00:58:18,065 --> 00:58:20,367
that you aren't willing
to do yourself.

1239
00:58:20,568 --> 00:58:23,737
In this illustration,
I will play the brave father

1240
00:58:23,837 --> 00:58:25,277
that has already conquered
the river,

1241
00:58:25,372 --> 00:58:27,608
and you will play
the scared little boy.

1242
00:58:27,741 --> 00:58:29,043
Just picture yourself as Henry.

1243
00:58:29,276 --> 00:58:31,212
Yeah, please don't talk
about my son. [sighs]

1244
00:58:31,345 --> 00:58:33,314
Your son,
he's the quiet, reclusive type.

1245
00:58:33,414 --> 00:58:36,750
If I've seen it once,
I've seen it 100,000 times.

1246
00:58:36,850 --> 00:58:38,786
If you do not
get a handle on this,

1247
00:58:39,153 --> 00:58:40,754
you're gonna have
a hoarder for a son.

1248
00:58:40,921 --> 00:58:43,157
Hey, Eddie, shut your mouth
before I shut it for you.

1249
00:58:43,257 --> 00:58:45,526
Today,
he is a quiet little bookworm.

1250
00:58:45,659 --> 00:58:48,028
Tomorrow,
he is stuck in an apartment

1251
00:58:48,128 --> 00:58:49,563
with a bunch of junk
that he bought

1252
00:58:49,663 --> 00:58:52,333
at a home shopping channel
with your credit card, bucko.

1253
00:58:52,433 --> 00:58:53,767
- Hey, Eddie.
- Yeah?

1254
00:58:54,034 --> 00:58:55,236
[groans]

1255
00:58:55,569 --> 00:58:56,570
[Eddie] No, no!

1256
00:58:56,870 --> 00:58:59,373
- [grunts]
- Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

1257
00:58:59,473 --> 00:59:01,642
[sighs] My glasses.

1258
00:59:02,076 --> 00:59:03,877
- [grunts]
- [chuckles]

1259
00:59:04,178 --> 00:59:06,814
No, not my mustache! [gurgles]

1260
00:59:08,882 --> 00:59:11,185
[ominous music playing]

1261
00:59:11,385 --> 00:59:12,753
[yells]

1262
00:59:13,654 --> 00:59:16,323
- [grunts]
- [gasps, grunts]

1263
00:59:18,125 --> 00:59:21,629
- I am a chiropractor!
- [Tommy gasping]

1264
00:59:21,795 --> 00:59:22,997
[coughing]

1265
00:59:26,400 --> 00:59:28,202
- [Tommy] You're so dead.
- You don't know me.

1266
00:59:28,302 --> 00:59:32,741
No, who consecrates
a yurt with a harmonica song?

1267
00:59:32,840 --> 00:59:37,044
I do, I do with pleasure,
with pleasure.

1268
00:59:37,144 --> 00:59:39,847
Well, it's not pleasurable
to anyone else!

1269
00:59:39,947 --> 00:59:44,051
You don't know anything!
Anything, anything, anything!

1270
00:59:46,487 --> 00:59:48,188
[Grace groaning]

1271
00:59:55,162 --> 00:59:56,163
Uh...

1272
00:59:57,798 --> 00:59:59,166
[Grace groans]

1273
00:59:59,833 --> 01:00:01,235
Mind if I join you?

1274
01:00:05,272 --> 01:00:06,273
Sure.

1275
01:00:08,175 --> 01:00:10,712
[Victoria] Do you want to
talk about it,

1276
01:00:10,811 --> 01:00:13,080
- or...
- No, no, I don't.

1277
01:00:13,447 --> 01:00:14,815
[Victoria] Okay.

1278
01:00:15,784 --> 01:00:17,184
I mean, no offense, but, like,

1279
01:00:17,351 --> 01:00:19,953
your marriage
is just a little too perfect

1280
01:00:20,287 --> 01:00:23,190
for me to, you know,
talk to you about my marriage.

1281
01:00:23,290 --> 01:00:25,359
So I'm just,
I'm not even gonna go there.

1282
01:00:25,459 --> 01:00:26,327
[sobs]

1283
01:00:26,460 --> 01:00:29,563
You know, like,
here's the thing, okay?

1284
01:00:29,663 --> 01:00:31,965
I thought
that we would come here

1285
01:00:32,099 --> 01:00:35,302
and that my family
would just magically become

1286
01:00:35,402 --> 01:00:36,805
the family
that I've always wanted

1287
01:00:36,904 --> 01:00:39,173
them to be. [sniffles]

1288
01:00:40,207 --> 01:00:42,409
Whatever you think about me
and my family, uh,

1289
01:00:42,976 --> 01:00:44,421
you know, things get
a lot more complicated

1290
01:00:44,445 --> 01:00:46,125
when you get a peek
behind the curtain, so.

1291
01:00:46,180 --> 01:00:48,882
[chuckles] Oh, please,

1292
01:00:49,149 --> 01:00:51,185
you're like
the perfect Christian family.

1293
01:00:51,618 --> 01:00:55,022
You even eat like Jesus
would eat, for crying out loud.

1294
01:00:55,589 --> 01:00:56,623
[sighs]

1295
01:00:57,792 --> 01:00:59,259
We're kind of falling apart.

1296
01:01:00,294 --> 01:01:02,429
Ooh, I just said that out loud.

1297
01:01:03,997 --> 01:01:05,265
We're falling apart.

1298
01:01:09,136 --> 01:01:10,137
Uh.

1299
01:01:10,938 --> 01:01:12,272
Okay, um...

1300
01:01:14,641 --> 01:01:15,642
go on.

1301
01:01:16,877 --> 01:01:18,813
I'm really good
at keeping our secret

1302
01:01:19,413 --> 01:01:22,149
and I put a smile on at church
and I pray and I pray

1303
01:01:22,282 --> 01:01:25,919
and I pray, Grace, I pray,
and I have no voice.

1304
01:01:26,153 --> 01:01:27,393
I have no voice in my marriage,

1305
01:01:27,454 --> 01:01:29,156
and Eddie controls everything,
everything.

1306
01:01:29,256 --> 01:01:31,158
And I give my opinions,
but it's like

1307
01:01:31,258 --> 01:01:33,961
he doesn't even care, you know,
he doesn't even listen.

1308
01:01:34,361 --> 01:01:37,498
And I don't even have
the strength to make him care,

1309
01:01:37,598 --> 01:01:39,868
you know? [sighs]

1310
01:01:40,534 --> 01:01:43,170
And I don't know how much longer
I can go on feeling like...

1311
01:01:45,372 --> 01:01:46,373
I don't matter.

1312
01:01:51,311 --> 01:01:53,213
I did not see that coming.

1313
01:01:53,614 --> 01:01:58,018
- Sorry, that was like, blah.
- [Grace] Oh, no, it's okay.

1314
01:01:58,152 --> 01:02:00,687
Ladies,
I don't mean to interrupt,

1315
01:02:01,856 --> 01:02:03,056
but we have a problem.

1316
01:02:03,792 --> 01:02:09,129
- Get in line. [laughs]
- [laughs]

1317
01:02:09,696 --> 01:02:10,732
Oh, you're serious.

1318
01:02:10,832 --> 01:02:15,702
[harmonica playing]

1319
01:02:21,208 --> 01:02:23,644
I can't find my lunch anywhere.

1320
01:02:24,344 --> 01:02:25,914
So let me get this straight.

1321
01:02:26,213 --> 01:02:27,749
You've got these
anti-hypothermia

1322
01:02:27,849 --> 01:02:29,049
space age blankets

1323
01:02:29,249 --> 01:02:31,853
in your backpack,
you've got an epinephrine shot,

1324
01:02:31,952 --> 01:02:33,120
a backup epinephrine shot,

1325
01:02:33,220 --> 01:02:35,857
but you got no map,
no compass, nothing?

1326
01:02:35,956 --> 01:02:37,257
<i>- Correctamundo.</i>
- [chuckles]

1327
01:02:37,357 --> 01:02:40,961
- [stomach growls]
- Oh, my stomach just ate itself.

1328
01:02:41,328 --> 01:02:43,173
[Eddie] Oh, I forgot to mention
that my blood sugar

1329
01:02:43,197 --> 01:02:45,232
was getting a little low,
so I ate your lunch.

1330
01:02:46,768 --> 01:02:47,768
Come again?

1331
01:02:47,802 --> 01:02:49,269
I was addressing a medical need.

1332
01:02:49,369 --> 01:02:51,706
Hey, it's okay, <i>mi</i> amigo.

1333
01:02:52,105 --> 01:02:55,476
When God closes a door,
he opens a Chick-fil-A.

1334
01:02:55,877 --> 01:02:58,111
[chuckles]
So you stole my lunch?

1335
01:02:58,645 --> 01:03:02,049
This is amazing, you realize
we could die out here, right?

1336
01:03:02,282 --> 01:03:03,952
Whoa, bucko, hey,
we don't need to

1337
01:03:04,051 --> 01:03:05,185
look at it that way.

1338
01:03:05,319 --> 01:03:07,020
We need to look at this
as an opportunity

1339
01:03:07,120 --> 01:03:08,355
to grow our faith.

1340
01:03:08,989 --> 01:03:11,024
You know what,
the only reason I came

1341
01:03:11,124 --> 01:03:13,460
on this stupid hike
was to grow my faith.

1342
01:03:13,560 --> 01:03:15,830
- Hey, let it out.
- [Tommy] Okay, I will.

1343
01:03:16,063 --> 01:03:18,332
You know, I thought
maybe I'd come out here,

1344
01:03:18,432 --> 01:03:20,567
he'd say something,
he'd show me something.

1345
01:03:20,667 --> 01:03:22,569
Instead, I'm stuck here

1346
01:03:22,703 --> 01:03:25,205
with Dr. Phil's demented
twin brother when I should be

1347
01:03:25,305 --> 01:03:27,842
back at the camp singing
"Kumbaya" with my family.

1348
01:03:28,075 --> 01:03:29,309
How's that make you feel?

1349
01:03:29,409 --> 01:03:31,411
I'll tell you
how it makes me feel, all right?

1350
01:03:31,578 --> 01:03:34,883
I feel like if God is in control
of all this, then I don't know

1351
01:03:34,983 --> 01:03:36,784
if I'm really
that interested in faith.

1352
01:03:40,687 --> 01:03:44,826
[harmonica playing]

1353
01:03:45,058 --> 01:03:46,460
Please stop that.

1354
01:03:47,127 --> 01:03:49,764
- [Eddie] Stop what?
- [harmonica playing]

1355
01:03:49,864 --> 01:03:50,865
That.

1356
01:03:51,131 --> 01:03:53,634
Stop this?

1357
01:03:53,902 --> 01:03:59,273
- [harmonica playing]
- Yes, that.

1358
01:04:01,709 --> 01:04:02,710
Can't.

1359
01:04:08,382 --> 01:04:10,718
- [Tommy] May I see that?
- Hmm?

1360
01:04:10,818 --> 01:04:12,286
Can I see that?

1361
01:04:15,757 --> 01:04:16,824
Thanks.

1362
01:04:20,193 --> 01:04:22,095
- [bird squawks]
- [Tommy chuckles]

1363
01:04:22,195 --> 01:04:24,231
[mild tempo music playing]

1364
01:04:24,331 --> 01:04:26,633
What you gonna do now,
little bald man?

1365
01:04:28,870 --> 01:04:32,339
- [screeches]
- [grunts]

1366
01:04:32,974 --> 01:04:36,811
[screams]

1367
01:04:38,278 --> 01:04:42,482
- [grunts]
- [cell phone trilling]

1368
01:04:42,583 --> 01:04:44,217
[Tommy] <i>You've reached</i>
<i>Tommy Ackerman,</i>

1369
01:04:44,318 --> 01:04:46,129
<i>senior investment strategist
for Wiley and Edmund.</i>

1370
01:04:46,153 --> 01:04:49,791
<i>- I'm not available right now.</i>
- [indistinct chatter]

1371
01:04:51,826 --> 01:04:53,027
[Joel clears throat]

1372
01:04:53,393 --> 01:04:55,362
So we've got
the sheriff's office,

1373
01:04:55,596 --> 01:04:58,532
Park Services, and great team
of volunteers searching

1374
01:04:58,632 --> 01:05:01,168
for your husbands right now.
They're gonna be out there

1375
01:05:01,268 --> 01:05:03,537
for two hours...

1376
01:05:04,237 --> 01:05:06,239
but they're gonna hit it again,
first light.

1377
01:05:07,041 --> 01:05:08,308
And then what?

1378
01:05:11,211 --> 01:05:13,447
You know, these guys
are really good at what they do.

1379
01:05:14,214 --> 01:05:15,491
I think the best thing
for right now

1380
01:05:15,515 --> 01:05:19,252
- is if y'all stay put.
- We stay put, sure.

1381
01:05:20,320 --> 01:05:22,389
We just sit still,
stay put, thank you for that.

1382
01:05:22,489 --> 01:05:24,529
We'll just stay put
while our husbands are out there

1383
01:05:24,591 --> 01:05:26,426
that have never been
out there before, like...

1384
01:05:28,930 --> 01:05:29,931
Joel?

1385
01:05:30,330 --> 01:05:33,667
[soft music playing]

1386
01:05:33,768 --> 01:05:34,902
[sighs]

1387
01:05:35,602 --> 01:05:36,603
Hey, Grace?

1388
01:05:38,205 --> 01:05:39,473
They're coming back.

1389
01:05:40,273 --> 01:05:41,475
You hear me?

1390
01:05:43,343 --> 01:05:44,578
I really believe that.

1391
01:05:45,947 --> 01:05:47,280
I know that.

1392
01:05:48,448 --> 01:05:49,884
I'm gonna pray for us, okay?

1393
01:05:50,752 --> 01:05:51,786
Okay.

1394
01:05:52,854 --> 01:05:54,564
Sometimes I like to pray
in my prayer language,

1395
01:05:54,588 --> 01:05:58,525
- is that all right?
- Um, you mean like in tongues?

1396
01:05:59,961 --> 01:06:01,294
- Like in Spanish.
- Oh,

1397
01:06:01,395 --> 01:06:03,473
- yeah, that's good, that's good.
- [Victoria chuckles]

1398
01:06:03,497 --> 01:06:05,232
[sighs]

1399
01:06:06,166 --> 01:06:13,240
[praying in Spanish]

1400
01:06:14,408 --> 01:06:16,276
[continues praying]

1401
01:06:28,555 --> 01:06:33,627
- My dad plays the harmonica.
- Hmm, sounds like a good man.

1402
01:06:35,629 --> 01:06:37,397
He never really came
around much.

1403
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:41,334
Still doesn't. [sighs]

1404
01:06:41,836 --> 01:06:42,904
And if I'm honest,

1405
01:06:43,137 --> 01:06:46,040
I'm just living out
my greatest fear

1406
01:06:46,140 --> 01:06:47,574
of becoming just like him.

1407
01:06:49,110 --> 01:06:50,812
And the older my kids get...

1408
01:06:53,114 --> 01:06:54,347
I realize, I...

1409
01:06:55,482 --> 01:06:56,683
I don't know them.

1410
01:07:00,353 --> 01:07:02,924
This may surprise you
to hear this, but, uh...

1411
01:07:03,623 --> 01:07:05,258
I was afraid to have kids.

1412
01:07:06,728 --> 01:07:08,328
My parents,
they did the best they could,

1413
01:07:08,395 --> 01:07:10,473
but they didn't really leave me
with the best blueprint

1414
01:07:10,497 --> 01:07:11,833
to raise my own kids with.

1415
01:07:13,935 --> 01:07:15,235
[sighs]

1416
01:07:16,303 --> 01:07:18,706
And then I saw the twins
in the delivery room...

1417
01:07:20,307 --> 01:07:21,641
holding each other...

1418
01:07:23,211 --> 01:07:24,511
and this...

1419
01:07:25,445 --> 01:07:27,314
extra valve
in my heart opened up,

1420
01:07:27,414 --> 01:07:29,483
one I didn't even know
I had. [chuckles]

1421
01:07:31,318 --> 01:07:32,820
I love them so much.

1422
01:07:36,023 --> 01:07:38,826
And yet, I'm still afraid
I'm gonna mess them up somehow.

1423
01:07:42,997 --> 01:07:46,299
My grandmother always said
it's, uh, family...

1424
01:07:47,667 --> 01:07:49,669
it's God's plan
and our responsibility.

1425
01:07:50,104 --> 01:07:54,541
- Hmm. I like that.
- Hmm. Yeah.

1426
01:07:54,641 --> 01:07:56,911
Don't worry, <i>mi</i> amigo,
we are going to find

1427
01:07:57,011 --> 01:07:59,714
our way back home
to our families, I promise.

1428
01:08:01,281 --> 01:08:02,415
Now, that's a roaring fire.

1429
01:08:02,516 --> 01:08:03,796
[Tommy] Oh, quick, get them off!

1430
01:08:03,885 --> 01:08:05,528
- [Eddie] I'm trying! [grunts]
- [Tommy grunts]

1431
01:08:05,552 --> 01:08:06,653
- [Eddie] Ouch.
- Hot!

1432
01:08:06,754 --> 01:08:08,198
- [Eddie] Stomp them out!
- [Tommy] Hot!

1433
01:08:08,222 --> 01:08:11,358
- My leg hairs!
- [Eddie] Not today, Satan!

1434
01:08:11,458 --> 01:08:13,728
- No, no.
- [groans]

1435
01:08:16,429 --> 01:08:18,298
Oh, they look good.

1436
01:08:19,466 --> 01:08:20,835
- Do they?
- Yeah.

1437
01:08:35,615 --> 01:08:37,484

We'll be back at 0500.</i>

1439
01:08:50,765 --> 01:08:51,766
Okay.

1440
01:08:55,502 --> 01:08:57,872
Look, I know
I don't ask for much, God...

1441
01:09:00,241 --> 01:09:01,441
because...

1442
01:09:02,910 --> 01:09:07,581
you know, I like to do
everything myself. [whimpers]

1443
01:09:12,153 --> 01:09:13,520
But it turns out...

1444
01:09:16,858 --> 01:09:22,029
that I really love him
and, um, and I need him, so...

1445
01:09:27,601 --> 01:09:28,970
please bring him home.

1446
01:09:29,402 --> 01:09:34,108

[groans]

1449
01:10:01,534 --> 01:10:03,971
- Good morning.
- Hey, morning.

1450
01:10:04,504 --> 01:10:06,506
- Hope I didn't wake you.
- No.

1451
01:10:07,742 --> 01:10:08,943
[Eddie] How do I look?

1452
01:10:12,813 --> 01:10:16,449
- Fantastic.
- That's right, fantastic.

1453
01:10:17,484 --> 01:10:20,054
- Mom, Mom! [pants]
- What?

1454
01:10:20,254 --> 01:10:21,554
[Hannah] Henry's gone.

1455
01:10:22,489 --> 01:10:23,991

[indistinct chatter]

1458
01:10:36,037 --> 01:10:38,105
Okay, we believe
the boy is most likely

1459
01:10:38,205 --> 01:10:39,407
in this area here,

1460
01:10:39,707 --> 01:10:41,018
and the chances of survival
in this forest are falling

1461
01:10:41,042 --> 01:10:42,642
by the hour
for all three of them,

1462
01:10:43,077 --> 01:10:44,178
so we gotta move.

1463
01:10:45,612 --> 01:10:48,883
- [indistinct chatter]
- Grace, Grace!

1464
01:10:49,449 --> 01:10:52,485
- Grace. Grace!
- [Grace] What?

1465
01:10:53,354 --> 01:10:54,664
[Joel] I can't let you go
in there.

1466
01:10:54,688 --> 01:10:57,358
[scoffs] You say that like
you can stop me.

1467
01:10:57,758 --> 01:10:58,993
My son is out there.

1468
01:10:59,193 --> 01:11:01,104
I understand, that's why
we're doubling our efforts.

1469
01:11:01,128 --> 01:11:03,140
Yeah, that's great, it's just
not good enough, it's not.

1470
01:11:03,164 --> 01:11:05,565
[Joel] Grace,
that's not just some city park

1471
01:11:05,665 --> 01:11:06,767
you're walking into there.

1472
01:11:06,968 --> 01:11:08,836
It's the Ouachita
National Forest,

1473
01:11:08,970 --> 01:11:11,806
some of the roughest terrain
you'll ever encounter, Grace!

1474
01:11:12,907 --> 01:11:15,009
God knows
every square inch of it.

1475
01:11:16,476 --> 01:11:17,812
He knows where they are.

[soft music playing]

1477
01:11:24,285 --> 01:11:26,153
So when is he gonna tell us?

1478
01:11:30,623 --> 01:11:32,426
Cookie,
I need to borrow your truck.

1479
01:11:32,960 --> 01:11:34,428
- What for?
- It's an emergency.

1480
01:11:34,561 --> 01:11:36,563
Oh, it sounds like
my kind of party.

1481
01:11:37,999 --> 01:11:39,033
[clattering]

1482
01:11:43,838 --> 01:11:45,439
[Cookie] So, where are we going?

1483
01:11:45,906 --> 01:11:47,808
[Joel] We've got a little boy
to go rescue.

1484

[Eddie] <i>Mentorship lesson</i>
numero dos.

1485
01:11:56,117 --> 01:11:58,119
Tell me about this,
uh, cell phone

1486
01:11:58,219 --> 01:11:59,420
that you always seem to be on.

1487
01:11:59,887 --> 01:12:01,688
[Tommy] This is amazing,
we're here

1488
01:12:01,789 --> 01:12:02,869
in the middle of the woods,

1489
01:12:03,090 --> 01:12:04,810
and yet I still seem
to have a nagging wife.

1490
01:12:04,892 --> 01:12:07,412
[Eddie] Well, at least you have
a wife that cares enough to nag.

1491
01:12:07,694 --> 01:12:09,864
[Tommy] Um, it's my job, right?

1492
01:12:09,964 --> 01:12:12,266
I mean, some people
work in construction,

1493
01:12:12,366 --> 01:12:14,902
some people work in a classroom.
I do most of my work

1494
01:12:15,002 --> 01:12:16,003
on the phone.

1495
01:12:16,669 --> 01:12:17,989
[Eddie]
How do you set boundaries?

1496
01:12:19,240 --> 01:12:20,241
For what?

1497
01:12:21,308 --> 01:12:24,378
Well, I mean, if you work
in a construction yard,

1498
01:12:24,478 --> 01:12:25,822
you wouldn't be driving
the bulldozer

1499
01:12:25,846 --> 01:12:27,915
to the dinner table,
now would you, no.

1500
01:12:30,251 --> 01:12:31,684
Try using the sharp side.

1501
01:12:33,521 --> 01:12:35,489
Hmm, hmm.

1502
01:12:35,856 --> 01:12:39,326
Yeah, it's not that easy, okay?
I'm up for a promotion.

1503
01:12:39,894 --> 01:12:41,405
If I get it,
it changes everything, right?

1504
01:12:41,429 --> 01:12:44,265
I mean, who doesn't want to
not have to worry about money?

1505
01:12:44,697 --> 01:12:46,537
Get a new house,
a new car, don't have to worry

1506
01:12:46,633 --> 01:12:48,302
about retirement, I mean...

1507
01:12:48,502 --> 01:12:50,703
- ATVs! [chuckles]
- ATVs?

1508
01:12:50,938 --> 01:12:54,674
- Hmm, what, ATVs?
- Help, somebody!

1509
01:12:55,342 --> 01:12:56,609
Please help!

1510
01:12:56,710 --> 01:12:58,179
Hey, hey, hey,
come on, let's go.

1511
01:12:58,279 --> 01:12:59,513
[mild tempo music playing]

1512
01:12:59,612 --> 01:13:02,149
No, no, this has
"Thou shalt not steal."

1513
01:13:02,249 --> 01:13:03,384
Written all over it.

1514
01:13:03,650 --> 01:13:05,328
We can cover ten times
the area with these, okay?

1515
01:13:05,352 --> 01:13:06,554
We'll be back by dinner.

Four wheelers just don't appear

They belong to somebody.

1518
01:13:12,460 --> 01:13:13,527
Okay, okay.

1519
01:13:13,861 --> 01:13:16,497
I'm sorry, I just,
I missed my family,

1520
01:13:16,629 --> 01:13:18,933
and I'm so hungry.

1521
01:13:22,803 --> 01:13:24,604
Tonight is taco night.

1522
01:13:27,274 --> 01:13:28,742
No, it's stealing.

1523
01:13:32,379 --> 01:13:34,915
I forgot about the guacamole.

1524
01:13:36,817 --> 01:13:38,719
No, no, it's wrong.

Hello?

1532
01:14:06,780 --> 01:14:09,950
Okay, I'm done waiting,
we're losing daylight.

1533
01:14:10,050 --> 01:14:11,986
- It's now or never.
- Hmm.

Well, hey, little fella.

1537
01:14:33,941 --> 01:14:38,045
Who's daddy's big boy?
I'm daddy's big boy.

1538
01:14:41,882 --> 01:14:43,184
[Eddie] Tommy?

Tommy!

1541
01:14:52,426 --> 01:14:56,197
- Tommy!
- Please, stop screaming.

1542
01:14:56,764 --> 01:14:59,400
- My head's killing me.
- My legs feel like jelly.

[Slim] That's the tranquilizer.

Now it's rated

You're liable to feel
a little weak

- in the knees for a spell.
- Wait, I know you guys.

1547
01:15:12,379 --> 01:15:16,116
Yeah, yeah, you're on that,
uh, you're on that TV show,

1548
01:15:16,217 --> 01:15:19,286

- Always nice to meet a fan.

1549

They tried to steal our ATVs,

- you cornball joker.
- [gasps]

1551
01:15:23,757 --> 01:15:25,226
I retract my statement.

1552
01:15:25,326 --> 01:15:26,886
We're... we're not...
we're not thieves.

1553
01:15:26,961 --> 01:15:28,761
We're just trying
to get back to our families.

1554
01:15:28,829 --> 01:15:30,531
But, you see, I got one little

1555
01:15:30,698 --> 01:15:32,166
- teensy tiny problem.
- One.

1556
01:15:32,266 --> 01:15:36,503
You see, I ain't never
met a thief who weren't a liar.

1557
01:15:37,805 --> 01:15:40,874
Wow, I could sew that
on a pillow.

1558
01:15:41,475 --> 01:15:42,977
- Thank you.
- I'm sorry, um,

1559
01:15:43,077 --> 01:15:45,112
- were you calling him a liar?
- I did.

1560
01:15:45,212 --> 01:15:47,548
That man is my friend
and he is no liar,

1561
01:15:47,648 --> 01:15:48,949
and if you're calling
him a liar,

1562
01:15:49,149 --> 01:15:51,720
you're calling me a liar,
and nobody calls me a liar.

1563
01:15:51,819 --> 01:15:53,530
- Stop talking.
- You know what, we're fine.

1564

You can go on your way,
just skedaddle. Good day, sirs.

1565
01:16:00,227 --> 01:16:01,795

- No, no, no, no, no.
- Bye now.

He... he's just kidding, okay?

1569
01:16:07,801 --> 01:16:09,903
We... we love your show, we do.

1570
01:16:10,204 --> 01:16:11,639
- Oh.
- [Eddie] I'm not kidding,

1571
01:16:11,740 --> 01:16:13,040
fame has gone to your head.

1572
01:16:13,374 --> 01:16:17,044
No one watches your TV show,
now scram.

1573
01:16:17,645 --> 01:16:18,765

- [Slim] Come on.

1574
01:16:19,013 --> 01:16:20,414
Please tell them you're kidding.

- [Slim] Give me your honey pot.

1576
01:16:22,549 --> 01:16:24,928

- The honey pot ain't for me,

01:16:24,952 --> 01:16:27,788
you doofus McSpaz-a-tron,
come on. Hand it over.

[mild tempo music playing]

1579
01:16:31,760 --> 01:16:35,896
Now. [laughs]

1580
01:16:38,832 --> 01:16:42,670
Now, these woods,
this is home to a lot more

1581
01:16:42,771 --> 01:16:44,938
than just deer and coyote.

1582
01:16:45,873 --> 01:16:47,941
Mm, mm, mm.

1583
01:16:48,242 --> 01:16:49,810
Now, we'll come back
and untie you

1584
01:16:49,910 --> 01:16:52,479
in a day or two
when we're done squatching,

1585
01:16:52,781 --> 01:16:53,981
that is...

1586
01:16:55,215 --> 01:16:57,518

been tooked.

1587
01:17:02,956 --> 01:17:03,957
[Tommy] Please don't go!

1588
01:17:04,224 --> 01:17:05,859
- That was scary.
- [chuckles]

1589
01:17:05,993 --> 01:17:08,362
Please, don't leave us!

1590
01:17:10,197 --> 01:17:13,300
Look on the bright side,
we got our honey, huh?

1591
01:17:13,400 --> 01:17:15,869
You don't understand,
they were our last hope.

1592
01:17:17,504 --> 01:17:19,741
I'm starting to think
you don't want to be rescued.

1593
01:17:19,840 --> 01:17:21,776
Well, clearly
I was using reverse psychology,

1594
01:17:21,875 --> 01:17:23,520
and clearly I still need
some practice at it.

1595
01:17:23,544 --> 01:17:26,513
The only thing that is clear
to me is how clueless

1596
01:17:26,613 --> 01:17:27,816
you actually are.

1597
01:17:28,048 --> 01:17:30,250
I mean, you can't be normal
for one minute, can you?

1598
01:17:30,551 --> 01:17:32,319
Everything that comes out
of your mouth

1599
01:17:32,419 --> 01:17:35,255
causes every bit of me
to cringe.

1600
01:17:35,790 --> 01:17:37,224
It... it's like...
It... it's like

1601
01:17:37,324 --> 01:17:40,561
your head is just
a... a giant cheese grater

1602
01:17:40,661 --> 01:17:42,029
and I'm lactose intolerant.

1603
01:17:42,129 --> 01:17:43,364
When you open up your mouth,

1604
01:17:43,530 --> 01:17:46,533
it's just grade A cheddar
just starts coming out.

1605
01:17:46,633 --> 01:17:48,602
It's just. [imitates vomiting]

1606
01:17:48,837 --> 01:17:50,170
And in the midst of all of that,

1607
01:17:50,270 --> 01:17:52,339
I have to ask this question,
who...

1608
01:17:52,539 --> 01:17:55,576
who greets people
by giving them back adjustments?

1609
01:17:55,676 --> 01:17:57,644
Who in the world does that?

1610
01:17:59,380 --> 01:18:02,316
- Well, I do.
- Listen, do me a favor.

1611
01:18:02,483 --> 01:18:04,618
The next time you have
something that you just have

1612
01:18:04,719 --> 01:18:06,553
to say, don't,

1613
01:18:06,987 --> 01:18:09,656
because nobody
wants to hear you.

1614
01:18:13,994 --> 01:18:15,162
I get it.

1615
01:18:17,464 --> 01:18:18,465
I get it.

that always gets picked, right?

of two-man buddy systems.

Always invited to lunch,
always invited to the parties.

1622
01:18:43,457 --> 01:18:44,591
And then there's me.

01:18:49,963 --> 01:18:52,533

I've got news for you.

God doesn't make junk,
and that includes me.

No matter what
you may think of me...

1628
01:19:13,053 --> 01:19:14,288
I'm not junk.

1629

[Hannah] I just don't know
what I would do...

1630

- if it was just me and mom.
- Look, they're gonna find them.

Everything will be okay,
I'm sure of it.

What are you...
what are you doing?

1633

- Come on, don't be a tease.
- Excuse me?

01:23:40,220 --> 01:23:43,256
I've been going
in so many directions.

1685
01:23:48,361 --> 01:23:49,964
I need to find true north.

1686
01:23:54,001 --> 01:23:55,435
So if you'll have me...

1687
01:23:57,537 --> 01:23:58,973
I'll give you everything.

1688
01:24:03,978 --> 01:24:07,547
[sniffles] Just please give me
one more chance.

1689
01:24:09,951 --> 01:24:12,586

[grunts]

1691
01:24:16,556 --> 01:24:21,863
Eddie, Eddie, the ropes,
they just broke, it's a miracle!

1692
01:24:21,963 --> 01:24:23,131
- [chuckles]
- Oh.

1693
01:24:23,798 --> 01:24:26,134
Well, well,
yeah, it's a miracle.

1694
01:24:26,234 --> 01:24:27,400
[chuckles] I mean,

1695
01:24:27,567 --> 01:24:30,071
it's been like
a... a nonstop prayer service

1696
01:24:30,171 --> 01:24:31,471
on this side of the tree.

1697
01:24:33,406 --> 01:24:34,608
Have you been crying?

1698
01:24:36,510 --> 01:24:37,712
You've been crying.

1699
01:24:39,747 --> 01:24:40,748
A little help?

1700
01:24:41,716 --> 01:24:44,317
[birds chirping]

1701
01:24:44,451 --> 01:24:49,023
[soft music playing]

1702
01:24:53,227 --> 01:24:55,797
- [sobs]
- Mom, Mom!

1703
01:24:55,930 --> 01:24:58,365
Henry. [sobs]

1704
01:24:59,599 --> 01:25:02,602
[Henry] I'm so sorry,
I looked for him all night.

1705
01:25:02,702 --> 01:25:05,505
- I tried so hard. [sobs]
- [sobs]

1706
01:25:07,074 --> 01:25:10,343
I couldn't find him. Sorry.

1707
01:25:12,079 --> 01:25:13,080
Thank you.

1708
01:25:17,985 --> 01:25:20,154
Me and you are gonna have
kids like that one day.

1709
01:25:20,320 --> 01:25:21,521
Hmm?

1710
01:25:23,224 --> 01:25:25,492
[coughs, clears throat]

1711
01:25:25,760 --> 01:25:29,596

[Beef snores]

[snores]

1715
01:25:41,541 --> 01:25:43,144
I don't feel good about this.

1716
01:25:43,778 --> 01:25:45,746
It's our only chance, come on.

1717
01:25:46,646 --> 01:25:48,749
[snores]

1718
01:25:59,193 --> 01:26:00,393
Hmm.

They've got cheddar wieners.

1721
01:26:07,301 --> 01:26:09,270
- [snores, snorts]
- Get over here.

1722
01:26:09,369 --> 01:26:10,637
Do you want one?

1723
01:26:11,504 --> 01:26:14,942
See, Mr. Beef,
I told you them was thieves.

1724
01:26:15,776 --> 01:26:17,879
Beef. Beef.

1725
01:26:19,146 --> 01:26:21,349
- [grunts]
- Morning. [coughs]

1726
01:26:21,716 --> 01:26:23,383
[Slim] Put him in a choker,
will you?

1727
01:26:24,384 --> 01:26:26,254
Thought you could
pull one over on us.

1728
01:26:26,354 --> 01:26:27,755
No, look ahead.

1729
01:26:30,258 --> 01:26:33,160
- [grunts] Hi.
- Oh, hello again.

1730
01:26:35,428 --> 01:26:37,965
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa. [chuckles]

1731
01:26:38,465 --> 01:26:40,533
You wouldn't want to leave
your friend behind now,

1732
01:26:41,002 --> 01:26:42,970
- would you?
- Mm-mm, mm-mm, mm-mm.

1733
01:26:43,536 --> 01:26:47,641
Come on, now, step away
from it nice and slow like.

1734
01:26:47,808 --> 01:26:51,879
Yeah, nice and slow like.

1735
01:26:52,479 --> 01:26:54,882
[Slim] Well, well, well.

1736
01:26:55,816 --> 01:26:57,952
What we gonna do
with these two now?

1737
01:26:58,152 --> 01:27:00,054
Don't do anything crazy, okay?

1738
01:27:00,788 --> 01:27:04,624
Just, um, think...
think about your TV show.

1739
01:27:04,825 --> 01:27:07,261
- Oh, show's over.
- Huh?

1740
01:27:07,361 --> 01:27:08,561
Yeah, the network canceled it.

1741
01:27:08,628 --> 01:27:10,898
Is it because
you couldn't find big foot?

1742
01:27:11,265 --> 01:27:12,300
You watch it too?

1743
01:27:12,934 --> 01:27:15,202
Let me ask you something.
You know what it's like to have

1744
01:27:15,303 --> 01:27:19,639
your dream come true
reality TV show canceled, huh?

1745
01:27:20,241 --> 01:27:22,442
Do you? Do you!

1746
01:27:22,542 --> 01:27:25,645
Uh, it's... it's just a really
specific question.

1747
01:27:26,080 --> 01:27:27,348
No, huh, no.

1748
01:27:27,848 --> 01:27:30,650
Well, it's very difficult.
[grunts]

1749
01:27:31,052 --> 01:27:32,153
It's very difficult.

1750
01:27:33,921 --> 01:27:36,857
And now I think
I'm gonna have to cancel you.

1751
01:27:38,591 --> 01:27:40,728
Wait, that was unloaded
the whole time?

1752
01:27:41,162 --> 01:27:44,799
[screams]

1753
01:27:45,199 --> 01:27:46,367
Bigfoot!

1754
01:27:46,466 --> 01:27:47,667
- What?
- Where, where?

1755
01:27:47,768 --> 01:27:49,904
- Eddie, run!
- [screams]

1756
01:27:50,004 --> 01:27:52,440
[screams]

1757
01:27:52,740 --> 01:27:56,509
- I'll never walk again!
- Sir, please don't go.

1758
01:27:56,643 --> 01:27:58,545
- [Eddie] No, you don't. L2.
- [grunts]

1759
01:27:58,645 --> 01:28:01,048
- [Eddie] L4. And sleep.
- [grunts, groans]

1760
01:28:01,749 --> 01:28:07,554
- Eddie, you're a murderer.
- No, Tommy, I'm a chiropractor.

1761
01:28:07,855 --> 01:28:08,923
Oh, oh.

1762
01:28:09,023 --> 01:28:12,259
[rock music playing]

1763
01:28:20,901 --> 01:28:23,104
Come on!

1764
01:28:25,572 --> 01:28:30,745
You are not Rambo.

1765
01:28:36,817 --> 01:28:38,252
[pants]

1766
01:28:39,652 --> 01:28:41,688
Pull to the left, baby.

1767
01:28:45,826 --> 01:28:47,594
[gasps]

1768
01:28:49,063 --> 01:28:50,197
[exhales, gasps]

1769
01:28:53,234 --> 01:28:54,468
Drive!

1770
01:28:54,634 --> 01:28:56,380
- Come on, it's gonna blow! Whoa!
- [Beef] I got you,

1771
01:28:56,404 --> 01:28:57,304
little Squatchie.

1772
01:28:57,405 --> 01:29:01,008
[both scream, pant]

1773
01:29:01,142 --> 01:29:04,745
[both wail]

1774
01:29:05,645 --> 01:29:07,614
- [chuckles]
- [chuckles] That was amazing,

1775
01:29:07,748 --> 01:29:10,583
- Eddie, you did it.
- No, we did it.

1776
01:29:10,683 --> 01:29:13,954

[beaver clicking]

1779
01:29:29,070 --> 01:29:30,881
- Stop, stop, beaver, stop!
- [beaver clicking]

1780
01:29:30,905 --> 01:29:32,306
- Whoa!
- [Eddie] Watch out!

1781
01:29:32,473 --> 01:29:35,276
[beaver screams]

1782
01:29:35,543 --> 01:29:38,112

- [Tommy groans]
- [screams]

1786
01:29:58,065 --> 01:30:00,434
[Eddie] Bees, uh, I hate you,
I hate you, bees.

1787
01:30:00,734 --> 01:30:02,937
I hate them,
I hate the bees! [screams]

1788
01:30:03,037 --> 01:30:04,671
Hey, hey, hey, hold on, hold on.

1789
01:30:05,840 --> 01:30:07,041
If that's the bees...

1790
01:30:09,243 --> 01:30:11,545
-this is the trail
-We found the trail?

1791
01:30:11,812 --> 01:30:13,390
- We found the trail.
- We found the trail.

[both cheer, laugh]

1793
01:30:14,782 --> 01:30:16,393
[both] We found the trail,
we found the trail!

1794
01:30:16,417 --> 01:30:18,061
[both] We found the trail,
we found the trail.

1795
01:30:18,085 --> 01:30:19,763
[both] We found the trail,
we found the trail.

[mild tempo music playing]

1798
01:30:24,657 --> 01:30:25,702
- That just happened.
- Yeah.

[birds chirping]

1800
01:30:27,128 --> 01:30:28,796
Oh, let me gather
this stuff right here.

1801
01:30:28,896 --> 01:30:30,474
- I'll help you.
- You get going here, okay?

1802
01:30:30,498 --> 01:30:31,599
No, you don't need to help.

1803
01:30:31,698 --> 01:30:33,009
- No, it's good.
- You don't need to help,

1804
01:30:33,033 --> 01:30:35,169
- I got... I just need to...
- [Tommy] I got it.

1805
01:30:38,638 --> 01:30:39,840
What is this?

1806
01:30:41,909 --> 01:30:43,277
I didn't know it was in there.

1807
01:30:47,982 --> 01:30:48,983
Hey.

1808
01:30:49,649 --> 01:30:51,719
Hey! Look me in the eyes

1809
01:30:51,819 --> 01:30:53,120
- and say that.
- [sighs]

1810
01:31:03,063 --> 01:31:05,366
I... I didn't know... Okay, okay.

1811
01:31:08,802 --> 01:31:10,137
We were never really lost.

1812
01:31:12,139 --> 01:31:13,140
I, uh...

1813
01:31:14,508 --> 01:31:16,243
I knew where we were
the whole time.

1814
01:31:17,211 --> 01:31:18,279
Of course you did.

1815
01:31:18,979 --> 01:31:20,881
- You see, the truth is...
- No.

1816
01:31:22,316 --> 01:31:23,317
Don't.

1817
01:31:24,385 --> 01:31:25,386
I don't want to hear it.

1818
01:31:28,688 --> 01:31:30,824
Victoria doesn't love me
anymore!

1819
01:31:35,129 --> 01:31:37,665
[Tommy sighs]
What are you talking about?

1820
01:31:37,898 --> 01:31:40,700
She... she doesn't
love me anymore.

1821
01:31:40,801 --> 01:31:42,469
We're just...
we're just roommates,

1822
01:31:42,570 --> 01:31:43,971
just... just raising our kids.

1823
01:31:45,773 --> 01:31:49,343
Divorce isn't an option,
so we just exist.

1824
01:31:49,443 --> 01:31:51,812
[soft music playing]

1825
01:31:51,912 --> 01:31:53,914
She doesn't even want
to be around me... [sobs]

1826
01:31:54,014 --> 01:31:56,393
...so I just, uh, I just thought
if... if they'd think... [sobs]

1827
01:31:56,417 --> 01:32:00,354
...that I was hurt or even dead
and then miraculously returned,

1828
01:32:00,454 --> 01:32:02,774
- then things would be...
- No, no, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

1829
01:32:06,227 --> 01:32:08,195
Let me make sure
I understand this.

1830
01:32:09,330 --> 01:32:12,933
You're stuck
in a passionless marriage...

1831
01:32:13,934 --> 01:32:17,504
so you dragged me,
a complete stranger,

1832
01:32:18,205 --> 01:32:22,176
into this twisted,
manipulated, made up story.

1833
01:32:23,010 --> 01:32:24,745
You almost
get the both of us killed.

1834
01:32:24,845 --> 01:32:28,282
At the least,
you wreck our wives

1835
01:32:28,449 --> 01:32:30,384
and children, for what?

1836
01:32:30,818 --> 01:32:32,853
So you can come in
and sweep her off her feet?

1837
01:32:33,654 --> 01:32:36,257
Hmm, well, I don't know
about sweeping her off her feet,

1838
01:32:36,357 --> 01:32:37,858
but I really thought
if we could...

1839
01:32:41,462 --> 01:32:42,496
Your wife was right.

1840
01:32:43,364 --> 01:32:44,999
No, we have to finish
this together.

1841
01:32:45,099 --> 01:32:48,135
- We're finished.
- I can't go back by myself.

1842
01:32:53,708 --> 01:32:55,075
You stay away from me.

1843
01:33:00,581 --> 01:33:02,016
Oh, God, no.

1844
01:33:12,159 --> 01:33:15,162
- [Joel] Hey. Here you go.
- [gasps] Thank you.

1845
01:33:23,137 --> 01:33:24,872
[Hannah] Hey, come on, it's dad!

1846
01:33:25,406 --> 01:33:26,406
[Joel] There he is.

1847
01:33:26,473 --> 01:33:31,378
[crowd applaud]

1848
01:33:31,645 --> 01:33:34,281
[Grace] Tommy? Tommy!

1849
01:33:35,784 --> 01:33:36,817
- Tommy!
- Grace, Grace!

1850
01:33:36,917 --> 01:33:38,619
- Tommy, Tommy?
- Grace?

1851
01:33:38,720 --> 01:33:41,622
- [chuckles]
- [crowd cheer, applaud]

1852
01:33:41,723 --> 01:33:42,823
I thought you were...

1853
01:33:43,023 --> 01:33:45,859
I'm never leaving you again,
never. [sobs]

1854
01:33:48,862 --> 01:33:49,862
[Hannah] Dad!

1855
01:33:49,897 --> 01:33:53,167
- Oh, come here.
- [all chuckle]

1856
01:33:55,804 --> 01:33:57,347
[Henry] I was looking for you
in the woods

1857
01:33:57,371 --> 01:33:58,371
all night by myself.

1858
01:33:58,672 --> 01:33:59,774
- What?
- [Henry] Um.

1859
01:34:00,240 --> 01:34:03,310
I'm sorry, I just wanted you
to be proud of me.

1860
01:34:03,477 --> 01:34:07,716
[exhales deeply] I couldn't be
more proud of you.

1861
01:34:08,148 --> 01:34:10,017
You're perfect
just the way you are.

1862
01:34:11,151 --> 01:34:13,420
- Hi.
- I love you, sweetheart.

1863
01:34:13,620 --> 01:34:15,055
- I love you.
- Oh.

1864
01:34:15,689 --> 01:34:17,057
[all sob]

1865
01:34:17,991 --> 01:34:19,193
Where is he?

1866
01:34:20,928 --> 01:34:22,229
Where's Eddie?

1867
01:34:25,099 --> 01:34:26,539
- [Victoria] <i>Papi.</i>
- [Eddie Jr.] Dad!

1868
01:34:26,567 --> 01:34:29,002
- [pants]
- [chuckles]

1869
01:34:29,670 --> 01:34:30,904
[chuckles]

1870
01:34:34,942 --> 01:34:36,210
Let's go.

1871
01:34:39,079 --> 01:34:42,149
[Victoria] I thought
you weren't coming back. [sobs]

1872
01:35:03,203 --> 01:35:04,405
What you got there?

1873
01:35:05,807 --> 01:35:10,177
I was thinking about that jar
with all of those beads in it,

1874
01:35:10,277 --> 01:35:13,580
and I think it's just
a really terrible idea.

1875
01:35:13,748 --> 01:35:15,784
[birds chirping]

1876
01:35:15,916 --> 01:35:17,451
Me too. [chuckles]

1877
01:35:21,989 --> 01:35:23,190
[sighs]

1878
01:35:24,124 --> 01:35:27,027
How about
instead of taking beads out,

1879
01:35:27,494 --> 01:35:30,464
we put beads in for every day
that we have with each other

1880
01:35:30,564 --> 01:35:31,665
from this moment on?

1881
01:35:33,267 --> 01:35:38,205
Mom, I'm gonna need you
my first day of college.

1882
01:35:39,072 --> 01:35:43,010
I'm gonna need you
for my first real job...

1883
01:35:44,244 --> 01:35:48,415
for my first serious boyfriend.

1884
01:35:48,549 --> 01:35:50,050
[both chuckle]

1885
01:35:52,352 --> 01:35:54,488
Mom, I'm gonna need you
for everything.

1886
01:35:55,556 --> 01:35:56,557
[chuckles]

1887
01:35:57,958 --> 01:35:59,526
[Hannah chuckles]

1888
01:36:00,728 --> 01:36:02,262
So... [chuckles]

1889
01:36:04,565 --> 01:36:09,303
[soft music playing]

1890
01:36:19,480 --> 01:36:21,124
- [Eddie] You see the kids?
- [Victoria sighs]

1891
01:36:21,148 --> 01:36:23,293
Oh, I told them to get us a seat
next to Tommy and Grace.

1892
01:36:23,317 --> 01:36:25,085
Oh, no, bad idea.
Why don't we just let them

1893
01:36:25,185 --> 01:36:27,130
have their own personal space
for the last night of camp

1894
01:36:27,154 --> 01:36:28,794
- because that's a big deal.
- Hey, Eddie?

1895
01:36:30,991 --> 01:36:32,192
I need to talk...

1896
01:36:33,795 --> 01:36:34,796
and I just...

1897
01:36:35,262 --> 01:36:38,432
I need you to just listen, okay?

1898
01:36:41,836 --> 01:36:44,471
I've been praying for God
to change some things...

1899
01:36:45,172 --> 01:36:46,373
in our marriage.

1900
01:36:48,710 --> 01:36:52,646
But what I realized is that
the change starts with me.

1901
01:36:54,648 --> 01:36:56,985
God calls husbands
to love their wives

1902
01:36:57,084 --> 01:36:58,485
like Christ loves the church...

1903
01:36:58,585 --> 01:37:00,621
- Vic, let's be real clear...
- [Victoria] Eddie...

1904
01:37:01,923 --> 01:37:03,457
God doesn't control us.

1905
01:37:05,125 --> 01:37:07,494
He doesn't make
all the decisions for us.

1906
01:37:08,495 --> 01:37:10,765
He doesn't take away our voice.

1907
01:37:13,467 --> 01:37:15,035
And he loves...

1908
01:37:15,970 --> 01:37:17,739
what I have to say. [chuckles]

1909
01:37:19,106 --> 01:37:20,607
That is what I need.

1910
01:37:21,642 --> 01:37:22,643
[sighs]

1911
01:37:23,644 --> 01:37:25,212
I need my voice back.

1912
01:37:31,285 --> 01:37:34,756
- Let's hear it for the Brewers!
- [audience cheers, applauds]

1913
01:37:34,856 --> 01:37:36,323
[Dave] Woo-woo, sugar bear!

1914
01:37:41,896 --> 01:37:43,130
[chuckles] Look at that.

1915
01:37:43,765 --> 01:37:47,100
Now, our next award
is the Badge of Courage.

1916
01:37:47,267 --> 01:37:49,069
Now, this comes as no surprise.

1917
01:37:49,236 --> 01:37:51,238
You've all heard the story
of heroism

1918
01:37:51,338 --> 01:37:53,841
and the conquering of nature.

1919
01:37:54,207 --> 01:37:58,046
Well, this award
is being given to...

1920
01:37:58,145 --> 01:37:59,580
[drum rolling]

1921
01:37:59,680 --> 01:38:00,414
...Eddie Sanders...

1922
01:38:00,514 --> 01:38:01,849
- [gasps]
- ...for saving Tommy

1923
01:38:01,950 --> 01:38:03,493
from choking to death
in the first night of camp.

1924
01:38:03,517 --> 01:38:08,288
[audience cheers, applauds]

1925
01:38:19,333 --> 01:38:20,534
Thank you, Cookie.

1926
01:38:21,869 --> 01:38:23,136
Don't go anywhere, Eddie.

1927
01:38:23,370 --> 01:38:26,808
You see, that Badge of Courage
has earned you

1928
01:38:27,274 --> 01:38:31,144
- an extra 10,000 points...
- [audience gasps]

1929
01:38:31,244 --> 01:38:32,379
...making the Sanders

1930
01:38:32,479 --> 01:38:34,749
the winners
of the Camp Katokwah Cup

1931
01:38:34,849 --> 01:38:36,718
for the third year in a row!

1932
01:38:36,818 --> 01:38:42,623
- [audience cheers, applauds]
- [upbeat music playing]

1933
01:38:47,427 --> 01:38:48,763
[Eddie] Mind if I say something?

1934
01:38:48,863 --> 01:38:49,864
No.

1935
01:38:53,166 --> 01:38:54,368
Friends, um...

1936
01:38:55,669 --> 01:38:58,138
thank you for this great honor,
but, um...

1937
01:39:01,208 --> 01:39:02,844
I... I can't accept it.

1938
01:39:04,979 --> 01:39:07,314
Um... [sighs]

1939
01:39:10,018 --> 01:39:12,619
[sighs] I'm...

1940
01:39:15,890 --> 01:39:16,924
I'm a fake.

1941
01:39:20,193 --> 01:39:21,863
I've made my wife miserable.

1942
01:39:23,097 --> 01:39:25,532
Vic, you're right.

1943
01:39:27,367 --> 01:39:30,938
I have not loved you
like Christ loved the church.

1944
01:39:33,975 --> 01:39:35,275
And I am so sorry.

1945
01:39:36,911 --> 01:39:39,312
That's on me, that's on me.

1946
01:39:40,048 --> 01:39:41,648
I'm gonna go down there, okay?

1947
01:39:43,250 --> 01:39:45,652
The perception I've made
of my family, uh...

1948
01:39:47,889 --> 01:39:49,222
well, it's a trophy...

1949
01:39:50,490 --> 01:39:52,559
it's a golden idol, which, um...

1950
01:39:54,227 --> 01:39:57,799
- well, it makes me, uh...
- [Tommy] A liar?

1951
01:40:01,836 --> 01:40:02,837
Yeah.

1952
01:40:04,138 --> 01:40:05,405
The truth is I...

1953
01:40:07,240 --> 01:40:09,242
I got the two of us
lost in the woods.

1954
01:40:11,278 --> 01:40:13,915
[sighs] And I did it on purpose.

1955
01:40:14,082 --> 01:40:16,516
[indistinct chatter]

1956
01:40:16,650 --> 01:40:19,721
[suspenseful music playing]

1957
01:40:20,088 --> 01:40:21,254
An ill-conceived attempt

1958
01:40:21,354 --> 01:40:23,991
to try to win
the affections back

1959
01:40:24,092 --> 01:40:26,894
from my wife, I'm sorry.

1960
01:40:30,865 --> 01:40:31,866
[sighs]

1961
01:40:32,632 --> 01:40:35,235
- Hey, hey, here, I got it.
- Hmm?

1962
01:40:35,803 --> 01:40:36,804
I got it.

1963
01:40:37,772 --> 01:40:39,774
- [sighs, clears throat]
- [soft music playing]

1964
01:40:39,874 --> 01:40:44,377
I think, um,
when we were in the forest...

1965
01:40:46,513 --> 01:40:49,984
I think we both learned
a lot about life...

1966
01:40:50,283 --> 01:40:51,585
[clears throat]

1967
01:40:53,788 --> 01:40:54,789
...faith...

1968
01:40:56,991 --> 01:40:58,325
and family.

1969
01:41:01,028 --> 01:41:03,965
That wouldn't have happened
if we didn't get lost

1970
01:41:04,065 --> 01:41:05,166
in the woods.

1971
01:41:05,265 --> 01:41:07,835
See, I told you, God had a plan.

1972
01:41:08,301 --> 01:41:09,402
- Shut it.
- Okay.

1973
01:41:09,569 --> 01:41:10,905
- [Tommy] Seriously.
- Mm-hmm.

1974
01:41:12,206 --> 01:41:13,406
Yeah.

1975
01:41:15,442 --> 01:41:19,881
Um. What I'm trying
to say is, uh...

1976
01:41:22,682 --> 01:41:24,351
I've been forgiven a lot.

1977
01:41:29,190 --> 01:41:32,026
So how can I not forgive?

1978
01:41:34,128 --> 01:41:35,328
Yeah.

1979
01:41:38,199 --> 01:41:39,399
Hey.

1980
01:41:42,103 --> 01:41:43,104
I forgive you.

1981
01:41:43,336 --> 01:41:45,705
- Hmm, me?
- Yeah, you.

[Grace] Come on, guys.

1989
01:42:14,769 --> 01:42:16,204
You were terrible
at bubble ball,

1990
01:42:16,304 --> 01:42:18,072
but you are great
at everything else.

1991
01:42:31,285 --> 01:42:32,854
Thank you for hearing me.

1992
01:42:34,322 --> 01:42:35,823
You're worth listening to.

1993
01:42:37,325 --> 01:42:39,894

- [chuckles]

1994

You wanna play us out?
