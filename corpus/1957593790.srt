1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,833
(MultiCom jingle)

2
00:00:12,293 --> 00:00:15,293
(car horns honking)

3
00:00:26,037 --> 00:00:28,870
(whistle blowing)

4
00:00:30,349 --> 00:00:33,580
(upbeat salsa music)

5
00:00:33,580 --> 00:00:36,565
- [Voiceover] Today, one
of every three New Yorkers

6
00:00:36,565 --> 00:00:40,299
is foreign born and 90,000
documented immigrants

7
00:00:40,299 --> 00:00:42,568
enter the city each year.

8
00:00:42,568 --> 00:00:45,846
It is the strengths of
their hopes and aspirations

9
00:00:45,846 --> 00:00:49,763
that fuels the energy of
today's New York City.

10
00:00:52,893 --> 00:00:56,147
New York City is actually five cities:

11
00:00:56,147 --> 00:00:57,814
Brooklyn, Manhattan,

12
00:00:58,924 --> 00:01:00,424
Queens, The Bronx,

13
00:01:02,011 --> 00:01:03,511
and Staten Island.

14
00:01:08,349 --> 00:01:11,884
So why not travel around
the world in five burroughs?

15
00:01:11,884 --> 00:01:14,921
All any explorer needs is a subway token

16
00:01:14,921 --> 00:01:17,819
to cross the Atlantic, the Indian Ocean,

17
00:01:17,819 --> 00:01:19,319
the Caribbean Sea.

18
00:01:25,036 --> 00:01:27,203
Sample the local cuisine,

19
00:01:28,081 --> 00:01:31,647
purchase traditional crafts
from a street vendor,

20
00:01:31,647 --> 00:01:33,230
remember, have fun.

21
00:01:45,510 --> 00:01:47,360
(speaking in foreign language)

22
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:48,277
- [Woman] Oh, shut up!

23
00:01:48,277 --> 00:01:49,232
- [Man] Calm down.
- [Woman] No, No.

24
00:01:49,232 --> 00:01:50,102
- [Man] Take a deep breath.

25
00:01:50,102 --> 00:01:50,935
Let it go.

26
00:01:50,935 --> 00:01:53,429
- [Woman] Come on, you
were going to leave me

27
00:01:53,429 --> 00:01:55,827
in that club, all by myself, like--

28
00:01:55,827 --> 00:01:56,893
- [Man] Stop, stop.

29
00:01:56,893 --> 00:01:58,308
Just stop.
- [Woman] 5:00 in the morning.

30
00:01:58,308 --> 00:01:59,466
- [Man] Hey!

31
00:01:59,466 --> 00:02:00,550
- [Woman] Don't walk away from me.

32
00:02:00,550 --> 00:02:02,150
- [Man] Sylvie, I can't
keep bailing you out.

33
00:02:02,150 --> 00:02:03,463
- [Sylvie] What?

34
00:02:03,463 --> 00:02:04,913
You just lent it to me yesterday.

35
00:02:04,913 --> 00:02:06,195
I'm gonna pay you back.

36
00:02:06,195 --> 00:02:07,130
- [Man] Why don't you go home?

37
00:02:07,130 --> 00:02:08,016
Just get some sleep.

38
00:02:08,016 --> 00:02:09,159
- [Sylvie] I'm not afraid to be alone.

39
00:02:09,159 --> 00:02:09,992
Taxi!

40
00:02:11,873 --> 00:02:12,706
I don't need you.

41
00:02:12,706 --> 00:02:13,567
I don't need anybody.

42
00:02:13,567 --> 00:02:14,400
Asshole!

43
00:02:20,041 --> 00:02:23,590
Wooster between Broome and Spring.

44
00:02:23,590 --> 00:02:24,737
Can you turn on the air?

45
00:02:24,737 --> 00:02:27,020
- [Driver] It's on.

46
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:27,853
- Here.

47
00:02:29,101 --> 00:02:31,351
- [Driver] Don't like musk?

48
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:36,703
- Yeah, caio!

49
00:02:38,017 --> 00:02:41,173
(speaking in foreign language)

50
00:02:41,173 --> 00:02:43,423
(chuckles)

51
00:02:46,014 --> 00:02:46,847
Fuck him.

52
00:02:48,892 --> 00:02:51,536
I don't need his help.

53
00:02:51,536 --> 00:02:52,893
- [Driver] Excuse me?

54
00:02:52,893 --> 00:02:54,476
- [Sylvie] Nothing.

55
00:02:55,324 --> 00:02:57,305
- [Driver] You are in
the film business, huh?

56
00:02:57,305 --> 00:02:58,138
Movies?

57
00:02:59,177 --> 00:03:00,133
- No.

58
00:03:00,133 --> 00:03:02,007
Why, do I look like I am?

59
00:03:02,007 --> 00:03:02,840
- [Driver] Yes.

60
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:03,673
- Are you?

61
00:03:03,673 --> 00:03:04,587
- [Driver] No.

62
00:03:04,587 --> 00:03:06,239
No, no, no, not me.

63
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:07,406
My brother is.

64
00:03:08,344 --> 00:03:09,261
Vikram Raj.

65
00:03:10,401 --> 00:03:11,853
Big movie star in India.

66
00:03:11,853 --> 00:03:12,686
- [Sylvie] Really?

67
00:03:12,686 --> 00:03:13,520
- [Driver] Vikram Raj!

68
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:14,452
You've heard of him, no?

69
00:03:14,452 --> 00:03:15,756
- [Sylvie] No.

70
00:03:15,756 --> 00:03:17,102
- [Driver] Millions of fans.

71
00:03:17,102 --> 00:03:17,935
Millions.

72
00:03:19,147 --> 00:03:21,897
(carnatic music)

73
00:03:29,233 --> 00:03:33,066
(singing in foreign language)

74
00:04:08,688 --> 00:04:11,688
- I just wanna see if it still runs.

75
00:04:17,965 --> 00:04:20,715
(carnatic music)

76
00:04:43,305 --> 00:04:45,472
(humming)

77
00:04:52,812 --> 00:04:54,281
- [Sylvie] Why are we stopping?

78
00:04:54,281 --> 00:04:56,498
- Um, Wooster, between Broome and Spring?

79
00:04:56,498 --> 00:04:57,331
- Oh.

80
00:05:01,631 --> 00:05:03,881
(mumbling)

81
00:05:05,758 --> 00:05:08,175
Oh sh, I can't find my money.

82
00:05:09,449 --> 00:05:11,909
Please, if you write down your address,

83
00:05:11,909 --> 00:05:14,282
I promise I'll mail it to you.

84
00:05:14,282 --> 00:05:15,383
- I don't know.

85
00:05:15,383 --> 00:05:16,657
- [Sylvie] No really, please,

86
00:05:16,657 --> 00:05:19,172
this is really not like me.

87
00:05:19,172 --> 00:05:20,005
Please.

88
00:05:24,334 --> 00:05:26,350
Staten Island, okay.

89
00:05:26,350 --> 00:05:27,411
Thank you, Vikram.

90
00:05:27,411 --> 00:05:29,864
- [Driver] No, Bipin, Bipin Raj.

91
00:05:29,864 --> 00:05:31,669
- [Sylvie] Bipin, thank you, Bipin.

92
00:05:31,669 --> 00:05:32,502
- [Bipin] Thank you.

93
00:05:32,502 --> 00:05:33,335
- [Slyvie] Goodnight.

94
00:05:33,335 --> 00:05:35,002
- [Bipin] Goodnight.

95
00:05:54,921 --> 00:05:57,050
- [Sylvie] Bum, bum.

96
00:05:57,050 --> 00:05:57,883
Fuck.

97
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:08,553
(dog growling)

98
00:06:08,553 --> 00:06:09,386
Oh, hello.

99
00:06:14,995 --> 00:06:17,662
(groovy music)

100
00:06:22,995 --> 00:06:24,874
- [Voiceover] Welcome
to CBS News Radio 88,

101
00:06:24,874 --> 00:06:26,124
Traffic and Weather Together.

102
00:06:26,124 --> 00:06:27,087
- [Voiceover] Steve, you wanna get

103
00:06:27,087 --> 00:06:28,045
under the air conditioners.

104
00:06:28,045 --> 00:06:29,537
Here's Neil Bush, Chopper 88.

105
00:06:29,537 --> 00:06:30,697
- [Voiceover] Good morning for us,

106
00:06:30,697 --> 00:06:32,533
it's clear now but it's gonna get hot.

107
00:06:32,533 --> 00:06:34,784
We'll check with Greg Allen
at the CBS Weather Center.

108
00:06:34,784 --> 00:06:37,084
- [Voiceover] The WCBS
guaranteed high for today night.

109
00:06:37,084 --> 00:06:39,584
(fan droning)

110
00:06:50,246 --> 00:06:52,913
(door creaking)

111
00:06:59,558 --> 00:07:03,475
(speaking in foreign language)

112
00:07:06,112 --> 00:07:08,695
(bed creaking)

113
00:07:09,723 --> 00:07:11,837
- When will he leave?

114
00:07:11,837 --> 00:07:14,471
I'd like to sleep in my
own bed just one night

115
00:07:14,471 --> 00:07:16,233
- I told you.

116
00:07:16,233 --> 00:07:19,983
It is a great honor to
have him as our guest.

117
00:07:21,307 --> 00:07:22,940
- He's not the Maharaja.

118
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:24,652
(laughs)

119
00:07:24,652 --> 00:07:27,586
And I expect occasionally
he'll do for himself.

120
00:07:27,586 --> 00:07:30,204
- He isn't accustomed to living this way.

121
00:07:30,204 --> 00:07:31,791
- [Vikram] Chandra,

122
00:07:31,791 --> 00:07:33,726
bring me a glass of water.

123
00:07:33,726 --> 00:07:35,656
- All night long, I'm gonna kill him.

124
00:07:35,656 --> 00:07:36,489
- Shh ...

125
00:07:37,955 --> 00:07:41,154
- (yawns) Let it run

126
00:07:41,154 --> 00:07:44,071
so that there's no lead in the tap.

127
00:07:48,539 --> 00:07:50,655
(groans)

128
00:07:50,655 --> 00:07:53,072
(fan drones)

129
00:07:54,616 --> 00:07:55,962
Now close the door.

130
00:07:55,962 --> 00:07:57,564
We must keep the cool air

131
00:07:57,564 --> 00:07:59,935
so I can sleep well.

132
00:07:59,935 --> 00:08:00,984
Ah ...

133
00:08:00,984 --> 00:08:04,067
(serene flute music)

134
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:32,590
(train rattling)

135
00:08:36,018 --> 00:08:40,185
(train conductor drowned
by train rattling)

136
00:08:42,501 --> 00:08:44,343
(door slams)

137
00:08:44,343 --> 00:08:48,010
(distant television echoes)

138
00:09:00,042 --> 00:09:04,596
(speaking in foreign language)

139
00:09:04,596 --> 00:09:05,429
- Fuck!

140
00:09:09,270 --> 00:09:11,611
I'm sick of your shit.

141
00:09:11,611 --> 00:09:14,023
You said you'd do the dishes.

142
00:09:14,023 --> 00:09:16,773
I worked until 5:30 this morning.

143
00:09:18,891 --> 00:09:19,974
Jesus Josif.

144
00:09:21,257 --> 00:09:23,615
I'm cleaning up after people all night,

145
00:09:23,615 --> 00:09:25,115
all fucking night!

146
00:09:32,999 --> 00:09:33,855
I'm sorry.

147
00:09:33,855 --> 00:09:35,820
- [Voiceover] For today is 97 degrees.

148
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:37,177
That gives you some leeway there.

149
00:09:37,177 --> 00:09:39,727
That means it could go as high as 102.

150
00:09:39,727 --> 00:09:41,189
If you combine that with the high levels

151
00:09:41,189 --> 00:09:42,642
of humidity this afternoon,

152
00:09:42,642 --> 00:09:45,509
you're talking about a
heat index of 110 degrees.

153
00:09:45,509 --> 00:09:47,307
That is dangerously hot

154
00:09:47,307 --> 00:09:48,350
for New York.

155
00:09:48,350 --> 00:09:51,433
(upbeat salsa music)

156
00:09:52,437 --> 00:09:53,638
- Shit!

157
00:09:53,638 --> 00:09:55,088
- Shh ...

158
00:09:55,088 --> 00:09:57,513
Do you have to make so much noise?

159
00:09:57,513 --> 00:09:58,596
- Gimme kiss.

160
00:10:01,045 --> 00:10:03,509
- Do you really have to go?

161
00:10:03,509 --> 00:10:05,401
- Well, I have to get to
the office and my wife,

162
00:10:05,401 --> 00:10:06,234
you know, she--

163
00:10:06,234 --> 00:10:08,984
- Do not mention her in my house.

164
00:10:12,915 --> 00:10:13,748
Don't.

165
00:10:13,748 --> 00:10:14,665
- Why, why?

166
00:10:15,591 --> 00:10:19,560
- No more kisses until
you get me my dress.

167
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:21,983
The pageant is tomorrow.

168
00:10:21,983 --> 00:10:24,029
I can't believe you still
haven't gotten it yet.

169
00:10:24,029 --> 00:10:26,225
- We already talked about this.

170
00:10:26,225 --> 00:10:27,291
Don't worry baby.

171
00:10:27,291 --> 00:10:28,958
I told you, tonight.

172
00:10:30,947 --> 00:10:32,354
(knocking at door)

173
00:10:32,354 --> 00:10:33,530
- [Voiceover] Marisol?

174
00:10:33,530 --> 00:10:35,875
I'm going down to open up the bake shop.

175
00:10:35,875 --> 00:10:38,792
Make sure your father gets dressed.

176
00:10:41,015 --> 00:10:42,839
(window squeaking)

177
00:10:42,839 --> 00:10:44,756
- We'll party, tonight.

178
00:11:21,003 --> 00:11:25,541
(speaking in foreign language)

179
00:11:25,541 --> 00:11:28,124
(upbeat music)

180
00:12:20,402 --> 00:12:21,235
- Papa?

181
00:12:21,235 --> 00:12:22,326
- Don't tell anybody.

182
00:12:22,326 --> 00:12:23,741
Go to sleep.

183
00:12:23,741 --> 00:12:27,658
(speaking in foreign language)

184
00:12:38,852 --> 00:12:41,519
(alarm beeping)

185
00:12:43,167 --> 00:12:45,334
(moaning)

186
00:13:04,875 --> 00:13:07,875
(telephone ringing)

187
00:13:14,553 --> 00:13:16,090
- [Woman] Oh come on, baby, please.

188
00:13:16,090 --> 00:13:18,850
- It might be important.

189
00:13:18,850 --> 00:13:20,032
Hello?

190
00:13:20,032 --> 00:13:22,277
- Get your Romanian ass out of bed.

191
00:13:22,277 --> 00:13:24,216
Today is the day, compa.

192
00:13:24,216 --> 00:13:25,781
- Who's that?

193
00:13:25,781 --> 00:13:27,516
- [Man] It's Ramon.

194
00:13:27,516 --> 00:13:28,362
I'm up.

195
00:13:28,362 --> 00:13:30,695
- [Ramon] You got the money?

196
00:13:33,948 --> 00:13:34,885
- [Man] Now remember, no money

197
00:13:34,885 --> 00:13:36,399
until we see cigarettes, okay?

198
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:37,500
- [Ramon] Why, what's the problem?

199
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:39,581
- [Man] 'Cause that's the
way import export works.

200
00:13:39,581 --> 00:13:40,579
- [Ramon] When are we gonna do this?

201
00:13:40,579 --> 00:13:41,746
Where's it at?

202
00:13:43,565 --> 00:13:45,064
- Okay, I gotta go.

203
00:13:45,064 --> 00:13:47,717
- [Ramon] We gotta hand
shake on this to work.

204
00:13:47,717 --> 00:13:49,779
- [Man] All we gotta do is show up.

205
00:13:49,779 --> 00:13:51,362
Gonna be beautiful.

206
00:13:52,245 --> 00:13:54,247
- [Ramon] I'm trusting
you, we got a lot on this.

207
00:13:54,247 --> 00:13:55,138
- [Man] Ramon,

208
00:13:55,138 --> 00:13:57,509
it's gonna be beautiful, you hear me?

209
00:13:57,509 --> 00:13:58,547
- It better be beautiful.

210
00:13:58,547 --> 00:14:00,102
See you at the store then, alright?

211
00:14:00,102 --> 00:14:04,019
(speaking in foreign language)

212
00:14:18,766 --> 00:14:21,349
(upbeat music)

213
00:14:25,754 --> 00:14:27,840
- What are you looking for?

214
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:28,673
Matches?

215
00:14:31,685 --> 00:14:34,565
There's no money in there.

216
00:14:34,565 --> 00:14:38,085
We owe $400 for rent,
$75 to Mrs. Silesquin,

217
00:14:38,085 --> 00:14:40,967
$25 to Constantine for plumbing.

218
00:14:40,967 --> 00:14:42,734
- Come on baby, I'll pay you back tonight.

219
00:14:42,734 --> 00:14:43,601
I promise.

220
00:14:43,601 --> 00:14:45,832
- Your promise just don't gamble.

221
00:14:45,832 --> 00:14:46,749
God, Josif.

222
00:14:47,702 --> 00:14:49,249
- It's not gambling.

223
00:14:49,249 --> 00:14:50,883
Not gambling, business.

224
00:14:50,883 --> 00:14:52,050
Import export.

225
00:14:55,149 --> 00:14:58,149
That's what I do now, you know that.

226
00:15:02,231 --> 00:15:04,965
What are you gonna complain about, Elena,

227
00:15:04,965 --> 00:15:06,860
when I buy us a house
with air conditioning

228
00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:08,276
and a hot tub?

229
00:15:08,276 --> 00:15:09,739
- What happened to the air conditioning

230
00:15:09,739 --> 00:15:12,625
you promised me last month?

231
00:15:12,625 --> 00:15:14,958
That's what I thought.

232
00:15:14,958 --> 00:15:15,791
Big talk.

233
00:15:17,914 --> 00:15:19,391
Big talk.

234
00:15:19,391 --> 00:15:20,788
- Oh, I see.

235
00:15:20,788 --> 00:15:23,319
If I don't make money,
I don't desire, right?

236
00:15:23,319 --> 00:15:24,753
Right?

237
00:15:24,753 --> 00:15:25,793
Forget it, you're not listening.

238
00:15:25,793 --> 00:15:28,585
I don't even know why I talk to you.

239
00:15:28,585 --> 00:15:30,014
- I don't?

240
00:15:30,014 --> 00:15:31,004
You don't!

241
00:15:31,004 --> 00:15:32,602
- No, you don't, you don't.

242
00:15:32,602 --> 00:15:34,269
- [Elena] You don't!

243
00:15:46,872 --> 00:15:50,705

244
00:16:49,254 --> 00:16:52,495

245
00:16:52,495 --> 00:16:53,828

246
00:16:53,828 --> 00:16:56,411

249
00:17:09,165 --> 00:17:11,915
(door slamming)

250
00:17:13,896 --> 00:17:14,729
Josif.

251
00:17:27,286 --> 00:17:28,119
- [Josif] Get dressed up tonight.

252
00:17:28,119 --> 00:17:31,202
I'm gonna take you somewhere special.

253
00:17:34,585 --> 00:17:38,252
- [Elena] Don't get
blood on your good suit!

254
00:17:44,739 --> 00:17:47,656
(melancholy music)

255
00:17:51,789 --> 00:17:55,622

256
00:18:20,343 --> 00:18:23,343
(telephone ringing)

257
00:18:25,032 --> 00:18:25,865

Your message is important

00:18:31,528 --> 00:18:33,404
(beeps)

262
00:18:33,404 --> 00:18:36,249
- Sylvie, Sylvie pick up the phone.

263
00:18:36,249 --> 00:18:37,797
Okay, I'm sorry we fought at the club,

264
00:18:37,797 --> 00:18:39,597
but you have my keys.

265
00:18:39,597 --> 00:18:43,068
I don't want to call a locksmith.

266
00:18:43,068 --> 00:18:43,901
Look,

267
00:18:44,757 --> 00:18:47,731
don't take your shit out on me.

268
00:18:47,731 --> 00:18:48,801
Pick up.

269
00:18:48,801 --> 00:18:49,634

Sylvie!

00:19:24,607 --> 00:19:26,209
Hey!

282
00:19:41,811 --> 00:19:44,644
(banging at door)

283
00:19:53,382 --> 00:19:56,287
- Come on, I know you're in there.

284
00:19:56,287 --> 00:19:58,370
(laughs)

285
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:02,741
Sylvie, I need my keys.

286
00:20:02,741 --> 00:20:04,491
Please open the door.

287
00:20:05,567 --> 00:20:06,943
(laughs)

288
00:20:06,943 --> 00:20:08,526
I know you hear me.

289
00:20:09,419 --> 00:20:10,336
- Oh, shit!

290
00:20:14,039 --> 00:20:14,872
- Shit.

291
00:20:18,951 --> 00:20:21,340
Listen, I'm not going to
call a fucking locksmith,

292
00:20:21,340 --> 00:20:22,985

293
00:20:22,985 --> 00:20:26,902
(speaking in foreign language)

294
00:20:36,757 --> 00:20:39,340
(mellow music)

295
00:21:00,939 --> 00:21:02,280
- [Woman] You better not go fussing around

296
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:03,780
with that china cabinet.

297
00:21:03,780 --> 00:21:05,261
- Just making some coffee.

298
00:21:05,261 --> 00:21:06,428
You want some?

299
00:21:21,913 --> 00:21:22,746
- So.

300
00:21:24,091 --> 00:21:26,249
Now the coffee's in the china cabinet?

301
00:21:26,249 --> 00:21:27,283
- Oh no, woman.

302
00:21:27,283 --> 00:21:29,115
Just checkin' to see if it's secure.

303
00:21:29,115 --> 00:21:31,048
You know them rob coaster last week?

304
00:21:31,048 --> 00:21:32,497
Them take everything.

305
00:21:32,497 --> 00:21:35,348
But this here cabinet secure.

306
00:21:35,348 --> 00:21:36,588
Strong.

307
00:21:36,588 --> 00:21:37,902
Go on to bed now.

308
00:21:37,902 --> 00:21:39,402
Everything's cool.

309
00:21:42,051 --> 00:21:43,362
Just let me sit in the car!

310
00:21:43,362 --> 00:21:44,654
- No!

311
00:21:44,654 --> 00:21:46,760
- Look, what good is all this cheap china?

312
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:48,302
We never ate off it,

313
00:21:48,302 --> 00:21:49,176
but a Cadillac!

314
00:21:49,176 --> 00:21:52,210
- It's my granny's china
and I want it back!

315
00:21:52,210 --> 00:21:54,293
- When hell freezes over!

316
00:21:55,157 --> 00:21:56,157
- Crazy man.

317
00:21:57,329 --> 00:22:00,412
(footsteps stomping)

318
00:22:08,056 --> 00:22:09,723
- Oh lord, it's hot!

319
00:22:10,672 --> 00:22:12,155
- [Man] Where's the glaze, Errol?

320
00:22:12,155 --> 00:22:13,970
- At the store, right there, sir.

321
00:22:13,970 --> 00:22:15,390
- Stop rubbin' our car man.

322
00:22:15,390 --> 00:22:16,906
You're gonna ruin the finish.

323
00:22:16,906 --> 00:22:18,563
- Heh, let him wash it.

324
00:22:18,563 --> 00:22:20,169
She won't let him drive it.

325
00:22:20,169 --> 00:22:21,198
- What you talk about?

326
00:22:21,198 --> 00:22:22,648
I drive this car.

327
00:22:22,648 --> 00:22:24,002
- When?

328
00:22:24,002 --> 00:22:25,773
You've never driven that car.

329
00:22:25,773 --> 00:22:27,371
- I drive it here, right?

330
00:22:27,371 --> 00:22:28,204
Right, right?

331
00:22:28,204 --> 00:22:29,037
- Come on, no!

332
00:22:29,037 --> 00:22:29,870
So long as you ...

333
00:22:29,870 --> 00:22:31,022
- Cadillac.

334
00:22:31,022 --> 00:22:34,198
- Back home, the man was
happy with his scooter.

335
00:22:34,198 --> 00:22:36,797
He'll take that car
and make him a miracle.

336
00:22:36,797 --> 00:22:37,896
- Brenda, I don't understand

337
00:22:37,896 --> 00:22:39,373
how you let him sell your china

338
00:22:39,373 --> 00:22:40,959
and buy that old stink car.

339
00:22:40,959 --> 00:22:41,808
- I let him?

340
00:22:41,808 --> 00:22:43,088
No.

341
00:22:43,088 --> 00:22:44,969
The man sneak.

342
00:22:44,969 --> 00:22:46,467
For us he say.

343
00:22:46,467 --> 00:22:47,634
I don't drive.

344
00:22:50,046 --> 00:22:51,112
Maggie,

345
00:22:51,112 --> 00:22:54,426
Granny trusted me with the family china.

346
00:22:54,426 --> 00:22:56,545
Only precious thing she ever owned,

347
00:22:56,545 --> 00:22:58,475
40 years of cutting sugar cane.

348
00:22:58,475 --> 00:23:00,981
- Brenda, I know, I know.

349
00:23:00,981 --> 00:23:03,148
You don't have to tell me.

350
00:23:04,363 --> 00:23:06,030
- But I got the key.

351
00:23:07,359 --> 00:23:09,450
- Sinclair, where are you?

352
00:23:09,450 --> 00:23:11,224
Crazy man, move your
backside from the car!

353
00:23:11,224 --> 00:23:12,149
Move it now, man!

354
00:23:12,149 --> 00:23:12,982
Move it!

355
00:23:14,319 --> 00:23:16,755
All I ask is you don't touch the car.

356
00:23:16,755 --> 00:23:18,530
Don't touch the car.

357
00:23:18,530 --> 00:23:19,663
When you get your own car,

358
00:23:19,663 --> 00:23:21,462
you can touch it like a big fat woman.

359
00:23:21,462 --> 00:23:24,113
- Eh, eh, eh, why your neck's showing man?

360
00:23:24,113 --> 00:23:26,081
Give yourself a ride.

361
00:23:26,081 --> 00:23:26,914
- No problem--

362
00:23:26,914 --> 00:23:28,713
- Move the, move man!

363
00:23:28,713 --> 00:23:30,176
- Start facing that woman.

364
00:23:30,176 --> 00:23:32,391
Why you let her treat you like so, eh?

365
00:23:32,391 --> 00:23:34,352
They don't know about
the five finger solution.

366
00:23:34,352 --> 00:23:35,185
Pop!

367
00:23:35,185 --> 00:23:36,446
- [Errol] Watch your mouth now,

368
00:23:36,446 --> 00:23:39,565
before I slap them big lips off your face.

369
00:23:39,565 --> 00:23:41,673
You never treat a woman so.

370
00:23:41,673 --> 00:23:42,989
- That's why she driving you,

371
00:23:42,989 --> 00:23:44,778
instead of you driving that car.

372
00:23:44,778 --> 00:23:46,184
- You watching that vehicle man?

373
00:23:46,184 --> 00:23:47,017
- Close, and you know why?

374
00:23:47,017 --> 00:23:48,834
I'm gonna embarrass you
in front of your woman.

375
00:23:48,834 --> 00:23:50,477
- Let me go now, let me go now.

376
00:23:50,477 --> 00:23:51,423
Oh yeah!

377
00:23:51,423 --> 00:23:55,068
- Boys, boys, this car
got us fight, okay now?

378
00:23:55,068 --> 00:23:56,672
- You crazy.

379
00:23:56,672 --> 00:23:58,396
- Yeah, crazy.

380
00:23:58,396 --> 00:23:59,324
Don't touch the car!

381
00:23:59,324 --> 00:24:00,157
- Please!

382
00:24:00,157 --> 00:24:02,337
- Rodney's cousin's friend
looking for cars, eh?

383
00:24:02,337 --> 00:24:03,376
He's seen the Cadillac.

384
00:24:03,376 --> 00:24:05,458
He say it's a real good price.

385
00:24:05,458 --> 00:24:06,599
He give me his card.

386
00:24:06,599 --> 00:24:07,721
He tell me give it to you.

387
00:24:07,721 --> 00:24:09,370
Take.

388
00:24:09,370 --> 00:24:10,203
Do.

389
00:24:11,571 --> 00:24:12,404
Take.

390
00:24:14,068 --> 00:24:14,901
- Errol.

391
00:24:16,171 --> 00:24:17,004
Errol.

392
00:24:17,881 --> 00:24:20,772
Come with pass, having a party tonight.

393
00:24:20,772 --> 00:24:22,915
There's gonna be lots of women there, boy.

394
00:24:22,915 --> 00:24:23,748
Look.

395
00:24:23,748 --> 00:24:27,061
I promise myself I
wouldn't miss this party.

396
00:24:27,061 --> 00:24:28,998
Why don't we go there

397
00:24:28,998 --> 00:24:29,831
in style.

398
00:24:30,811 --> 00:24:31,728
Style, man.

399
00:24:35,578 --> 00:24:37,009
- You're right.

400
00:24:37,009 --> 00:24:37,927
We drive.

401
00:24:37,927 --> 00:24:38,760
- Style.

402
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:39,893
- I'll teach she a lesson.

403
00:24:39,893 --> 00:24:41,243
Brenda!

404
00:24:41,243 --> 00:24:42,821
- Hates it.

405
00:24:42,821 --> 00:24:44,843
- Oh, I better go.

406
00:24:44,843 --> 00:24:45,676
Big mess.

407
00:24:46,591 --> 00:24:47,424
I'll see you.

408
00:24:47,424 --> 00:24:48,757
- See you, girl.

409
00:24:52,499 --> 00:24:53,332
- Whoo!

410
00:24:53,332 --> 00:24:54,242
- Hey, baby.

411
00:24:54,242 --> 00:24:55,762
- How are we doin'?

412
00:24:55,762 --> 00:24:58,595
(cars honking)

413
00:24:58,595 --> 00:25:00,310
- Bye, Maggie.

414
00:25:00,310 --> 00:25:02,643
- Not like her, she trouble.

415
00:25:05,977 --> 00:25:07,477
- Go on, tell her.

416
00:25:08,699 --> 00:25:11,946
- I got something I wanna tell you.

417
00:25:11,946 --> 00:25:12,779
- Yes?

418
00:25:16,641 --> 00:25:19,521
- I'm goin' to the store.

419
00:25:19,521 --> 00:25:20,354
- What?

420
00:25:23,250 --> 00:25:25,250
- Me I drive it nowhere.

421
00:25:26,838 --> 00:25:29,088
Good wheels about this car.

422
00:25:31,980 --> 00:25:34,647
(food sizzling)

423
00:25:36,078 --> 00:25:38,245
- This heat is unbearable.

424
00:25:41,169 --> 00:25:42,919
It reminds me of when

425
00:25:43,898 --> 00:25:45,620
Far Cry from Sadaam,

426
00:25:45,620 --> 00:25:47,636
which I made for the great Ipram,

427
00:25:47,636 --> 00:25:50,719
premiered at the Cairo film festival.

428
00:25:51,773 --> 00:25:53,572
I was outside of the old Plaza Hotel,

429
00:25:53,572 --> 00:25:55,657
chatting with Al Pacino.

430
00:25:55,657 --> 00:25:57,990
Suddenly, we found ourselves

431
00:25:59,117 --> 00:26:02,324
besieged by an enormous crowd.

432
00:26:02,324 --> 00:26:03,324
Fortunately,

433
00:26:04,167 --> 00:26:06,509
the concierge appeared
and shouted in Arabic,

434
00:26:06,509 --> 00:26:08,741
"Make way for the star!"

435
00:26:08,741 --> 00:26:09,908
I looked back,

436
00:26:11,172 --> 00:26:13,990
and saw poor Al Pacino
struggling to maneuver

437
00:26:13,990 --> 00:26:16,078
through the impossible crowd.

438
00:26:16,078 --> 00:26:19,897
I pulled him through that surging crowd.

439
00:26:19,897 --> 00:26:23,312
It was many years ago, of course.

440
00:26:23,312 --> 00:26:24,145
He said,

441
00:26:25,145 --> 00:26:26,711
"Thank you, my friend,

442
00:26:26,711 --> 00:26:28,503
"Vikram Raj,

443
00:26:28,503 --> 00:26:30,114
"thank you."

444
00:26:30,114 --> 00:26:32,321
He said, "If there's
anything I can do for you,

445
00:26:32,321 --> 00:26:34,048
"please do call me."

446
00:26:34,048 --> 00:26:35,027
- [Older Boy] Why don't you call him?

447
00:26:35,027 --> 00:26:35,860
- Bala.

448
00:26:36,941 --> 00:26:40,767
- Al Pacino is on location, he is filming.

449
00:26:40,767 --> 00:26:43,184
I've spoken to his secretary.

450
00:26:44,627 --> 00:26:45,627
Don't worry.

451
00:26:46,498 --> 00:26:48,234
Soon your uncle will return

452
00:26:48,234 --> 00:26:49,984
to the silver screen.

453
00:26:54,728 --> 00:26:56,479
- You've changed your mind?

454
00:26:56,479 --> 00:26:58,147
You don't want fried eggs?

455
00:26:58,147 --> 00:27:00,055
- My yolk has bled.

456
00:27:00,055 --> 00:27:03,378
- The yolk is loose,
exactly as you like it.

457
00:27:03,378 --> 00:27:06,267
- If you see no difference,

458
00:27:06,267 --> 00:27:07,684
I'll have yours.

459
00:27:10,581 --> 00:27:11,675
- Where are you going?

460
00:27:11,675 --> 00:27:13,176
- [Bala] Outside.

461
00:27:13,176 --> 00:27:14,311
- [Chandra] Okay, take your brother.

462
00:27:14,311 --> 00:27:15,894
- I don't wanna go.

463
00:27:17,504 --> 00:27:19,504
I'm still, I, I'm sorry.

464
00:27:21,936 --> 00:27:23,870
- You need to ween that boy.

465
00:27:23,870 --> 00:27:24,703
- [Chandra] Don't slam the--

466
00:27:24,703 --> 00:27:27,599
(door slams)

467
00:27:27,599 --> 00:27:30,182
(door squeaks)

468
00:27:32,790 --> 00:27:36,957
(video game melody)
(electronic blasts)

469
00:27:44,543 --> 00:27:48,043
- [Little Boy] I wanna play with this, no.

470
00:27:49,054 --> 00:27:51,331
- [Voiceover] The North American bison

471
00:27:51,331 --> 00:27:53,431
relies on an acute sense of smell

472
00:27:53,431 --> 00:27:55,211
for detecting danger.

473
00:27:55,211 --> 00:27:59,367
Sight and hearing also
play an important role.

474
00:27:59,367 --> 00:28:00,717
- Chandra, tea.

475
00:28:00,717 --> 00:28:02,603
- I asked you not to yell.

476
00:28:02,603 --> 00:28:04,217
The water's on.

477
00:28:04,217 --> 00:28:05,429
- [Voiceover] For one or more days

478
00:28:05,429 --> 00:28:06,399
during the dry season.

479
00:28:06,399 --> 00:28:07,334
- Put up the volume.

480
00:28:07,334 --> 00:28:09,041
- [Little Boy] Mommy says no.

481
00:28:09,041 --> 00:28:10,617
- Put up the volume.

482
00:28:10,617 --> 00:28:12,457
Remember, rule number one:

483
00:28:12,457 --> 00:28:15,093
Never let a woman tell you what to do.

484
00:28:15,093 --> 00:28:16,593
Put up the volume.

485
00:28:18,034 --> 00:28:18,867
Put it up!

486
00:28:18,867 --> 00:28:21,034
(screams)

487
00:28:22,187 --> 00:28:23,945
- Now what have you done to him?

488
00:28:23,945 --> 00:28:25,719
- I'm not getting what I need.

489
00:28:25,719 --> 00:28:27,584
- [Chandra] Then go to a hotel.

490
00:28:27,584 --> 00:28:30,217
I've been on my feet all week,
(phone rings)

491
00:28:30,217 --> 00:28:32,134
caring for sick people.

492
00:28:33,121 --> 00:28:35,074
This is supposed to be my day off.

493
00:28:35,074 --> 00:28:37,741
(phone ringing)

494
00:28:43,889 --> 00:28:45,687
- [Voiceover] A kind of thick wet clay.

495
00:28:45,687 --> 00:28:47,559
- Stop it, son, stop it.
(baby crying)

496
00:28:47,559 --> 00:28:49,097
- [Voiceover] On occasion bison will--

497
00:28:49,097 --> 00:28:49,930
- Your tea.

498
00:28:49,930 --> 00:28:51,741
- [Voiceover] Roam into populated areas.

499
00:28:51,741 --> 00:28:53,424
While they are not particular.

500
00:28:53,424 --> 00:28:55,821
- [Girl On Right] What, excuse
me, the new Miss Colita,

501
00:28:55,821 --> 00:28:57,571
Miss Marisol Hidalgo.

502
00:28:58,989 --> 00:29:00,618
Ah, please.

503
00:29:00,618 --> 00:29:01,868
- [Marisol] Goodbye Brooklyn Boulevard.

504
00:29:01,868 --> 00:29:03,002
Goodbye 147th Street.

505
00:29:03,002 --> 00:29:05,397
- [Girl On Right] Oh no,
what, like who you tell us.

506
00:29:05,397 --> 00:29:07,452
- Don't you know my man with the fat cash,

507
00:29:07,452 --> 00:29:10,217
the real cash is settin' me up with this?

508
00:29:10,217 --> 00:29:11,235
He's hookin' me up.

509
00:29:11,235 --> 00:29:12,633
You know, I almost let him go

510
00:29:12,633 --> 00:29:14,967
when I found out he was married.

511
00:29:14,967 --> 00:29:16,629
- What do you mean he's married?

512
00:29:16,629 --> 00:29:19,137
- Well, come on, you
know I like to eat out.

513
00:29:19,137 --> 00:29:20,387
Steak, lobster.

514
00:29:21,946 --> 00:29:25,102
I ain't even lookin' for love.

515
00:29:25,102 --> 00:29:26,625
- Marisol!

516
00:29:26,625 --> 00:29:27,877
Marisol, get in here!

517
00:29:27,877 --> 00:29:29,457
You're not Miss Colita yet!

518
00:29:29,457 --> 00:29:30,716
- Eh!

519
00:29:30,716 --> 00:29:31,830
- [Marisol] Miss Colita.

520
00:29:31,830 --> 00:29:33,827
- So, I'll do it for you later.

521
00:29:33,827 --> 00:29:34,948
Alright?

522
00:29:34,948 --> 00:29:36,395
It's really, really cute.

523
00:29:36,395 --> 00:29:37,775
It's small pussy.

524
00:29:37,775 --> 00:29:39,442
Tell Mama I said hi.

525
00:29:40,356 --> 00:29:41,189
- Yeah.

526
00:29:46,714 --> 00:29:50,631
(speaking in foreign language)

527
00:30:00,283 --> 00:30:02,950
(phone ringing)

528
00:30:05,199 --> 00:30:06,372
- [Marisol] Hey baby, what's up?

529
00:30:06,372 --> 00:30:08,297
- I can't talk long, I'm in the office.

530
00:30:08,297 --> 00:30:10,747
Can you hold on a sec?

531
00:30:10,747 --> 00:30:14,867
Suzy, can you have Mr.
Hutton hold, please?

532
00:30:14,867 --> 00:30:16,771
The phones are ringing off the hook.

533
00:30:16,771 --> 00:30:19,211
- Just wanted to remind
you about the dress.

534
00:30:19,211 --> 00:30:20,492
It's in Soho.

535
00:30:20,492 --> 00:30:21,325
- I know.

536
00:30:21,325 --> 00:30:23,234
I know, Soho.

537
00:30:23,234 --> 00:30:25,484
- Don't work tonight, okay?

538
00:30:27,534 --> 00:30:28,867
I love you, bye.

539
00:30:38,814 --> 00:30:40,147
- Is he married?

540
00:30:44,933 --> 00:30:46,927
Where's your father?

541
00:30:46,927 --> 00:30:51,094
(radio announcer speaking
in foreign language)

542
00:31:00,723 --> 00:31:03,640
(melancholy music)

543
00:31:08,570 --> 00:31:11,320
(train rumbling)

544
00:31:21,232 --> 00:31:25,312
(singing in foreign language)

545
00:31:25,312 --> 00:31:29,305
- God, it's hot, it's supposed to be 100.

546
00:31:29,305 --> 00:31:30,218
(speaking in foreign language)

547
00:31:30,218 --> 00:31:32,551
- Fuckin' polyester is what.

548
00:31:36,308 --> 00:31:37,210
Come on, put it away.

549
00:31:37,210 --> 00:31:38,077
I don't wanna see it.

550
00:31:38,077 --> 00:31:40,071
- What's wrong, it's gold.

551
00:31:40,071 --> 00:31:41,721
- It's a small chain.

552
00:31:41,721 --> 00:31:43,221
Show it to Bowman.

553
00:31:55,285 --> 00:31:57,535
(knocking)

554
00:31:59,468 --> 00:32:02,468
- Let's see what you got, Iscovescu.

555
00:32:03,366 --> 00:32:05,449
- I want $75 on the Mets.

556
00:32:07,397 --> 00:32:09,396
- [Bowman] Are you crazy, the Mets?

557
00:32:09,396 --> 00:32:11,896
- Yeah, New York fuckin' Mets.

558
00:32:13,130 --> 00:32:15,040
- It's a big overlay.

559
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:16,313
Eight and a half?

560
00:32:16,313 --> 00:32:17,563
Two and a half.

561
00:32:18,621 --> 00:32:21,474
- That watch is worth $500 dollars.

562
00:32:21,474 --> 00:32:22,307
- Yeah?

563
00:32:24,468 --> 00:32:26,518
Where'd you get it?

564
00:32:26,518 --> 00:32:30,267
It's too hot for bullshit, god you.

565
00:32:30,267 --> 00:32:33,022
I'll give you $50 on the Mets.

566
00:32:33,022 --> 00:32:33,855
- $50?

567
00:32:39,946 --> 00:32:40,779
Okay.

568
00:32:41,958 --> 00:32:44,156
Don't scratch it up.

569
00:32:44,156 --> 00:32:46,117
I'll be back for it.

570
00:32:46,117 --> 00:32:49,549
(siren blaring)

571
00:32:49,549 --> 00:32:52,466
(melancholy music)

572
00:33:01,557 --> 00:33:05,140
(comical melancholy music)

573
00:33:26,713 --> 00:33:29,310
(groans)

574
00:33:29,310 --> 00:33:32,893
(comical melancholy music)

575
00:33:44,942 --> 00:33:45,775
Shit!

576
00:34:00,584 --> 00:34:02,735
(bell rings)

577
00:34:02,735 --> 00:34:04,028
- Oh ho, ho!

578
00:34:04,028 --> 00:34:05,528
What have we here?

579
00:34:07,343 --> 00:34:08,926
And a minute early.

580
00:34:14,241 --> 00:34:16,405
These are very fresh pork chops.

581
00:34:16,405 --> 00:34:18,238
You're in for a treat.

582
00:34:19,192 --> 00:34:23,109
(speaking in foreign language)

583
00:34:25,070 --> 00:34:26,083
Don't worry, take it.

584
00:34:26,083 --> 00:34:27,983
- I can pay, and I will pay.

585
00:34:27,983 --> 00:34:29,799
Please, can you hold this for me?

586
00:34:29,799 --> 00:34:30,780
- No, no.

587
00:34:30,780 --> 00:34:33,863
Josif will drop it off on his way.

588
00:34:35,446 --> 00:34:37,279
No discussion.

589
00:34:37,279 --> 00:34:41,781
(speaking in foreign language)

590
00:34:41,781 --> 00:34:43,238
- She never has the money.

591
00:34:43,238 --> 00:34:46,659
She's a direct descendant
of Stefan Cel Mare.

592
00:34:46,659 --> 00:34:48,865
- [Josif] Oh, Stefan Cel Mare.

593
00:34:48,865 --> 00:34:49,948
- [Both] Ooh!

594
00:34:51,399 --> 00:34:52,725
- No (speaking in foreign
language) in this shop,

595
00:34:52,725 --> 00:34:54,521
(speaking in foreign language).

596
00:34:54,521 --> 00:34:57,474
(speaking in foreign language).

597
00:34:57,474 --> 00:35:00,054
Put this on the shelf in the meat locker.

598
00:35:00,054 --> 00:35:03,971
(speaking in foreign language)

599
00:35:05,878 --> 00:35:08,795
(knocking on door)

600
00:35:10,369 --> 00:35:11,369
- Aye, sir?

601
00:35:17,670 --> 00:35:18,503
Aye, sir?

602
00:35:21,376 --> 00:35:22,926
(groans)

603
00:35:22,926 --> 00:35:25,694
(coughs)

604
00:35:25,694 --> 00:35:26,708
If you keep the door closed,

605
00:35:26,708 --> 00:35:29,412
the rest of the house won't get cool.

606
00:35:29,412 --> 00:35:33,079
- This house needs a
bigger air conditioner.

607
00:35:39,304 --> 00:35:40,887
- You have company.

608
00:35:43,994 --> 00:35:46,577
(upbeat music)

609
00:35:56,747 --> 00:35:58,914
- Bala, if you don't mind.

610
00:35:59,921 --> 00:36:02,541
Find Simon and play with him.

611
00:36:02,541 --> 00:36:06,548
(singing in foreign language)

612
00:36:06,548 --> 00:36:10,465
(speaking in foreign language)

613
00:36:11,804 --> 00:36:15,387
(music echoes in distance)

614
00:36:36,545 --> 00:36:38,244
- Glad to see you all.

615
00:36:38,244 --> 00:36:39,077
Welcome.

616
00:36:39,997 --> 00:36:44,164
(upbeat music)
(laughing)

617
00:36:51,309 --> 00:36:55,142

(doorbell rings)

619
00:36:57,621 --> 00:36:59,671
- [Vikram] Chandra?

620
00:36:59,671 --> 00:37:02,254
(upbeat music)

621
00:37:04,802 --> 00:37:07,719
(doorbell ringing)

622
00:37:12,129 --> 00:37:16,046
(speaking in foreign language)

623
00:37:28,972 --> 00:37:30,870
- [Voiceover] It's a
scorching hot day in Queens,

624
00:37:30,870 --> 00:37:32,997
as right-hander Dave Malicki takes the--

625
00:37:32,997 --> 00:37:34,371
- Yes, man I'm tellin' ya.

626
00:37:34,371 --> 00:37:36,209
I'm tellin' ya man, yes!

627
00:37:36,209 --> 00:37:37,629
- [Voiceover] Six game losing street.

628
00:37:37,629 --> 00:37:39,897
(car bass drowns out radio)

629
00:37:39,897 --> 00:37:41,047
Looking very solid indeed,

630
00:37:41,047 --> 00:37:44,673
a 3.14 ERA for the first
half of this season.

631
00:37:44,673 --> 00:37:48,840
(slaps)
(dominoes rattle)

632
00:37:49,676 --> 00:37:52,509
(car bass booms)

633
00:38:26,265 --> 00:38:28,765
(lock clicks)

634
00:38:40,277 --> 00:38:43,444
(car engine starting)

635
00:38:46,235 --> 00:38:50,152
(air conditioning fan blowing)

636
00:38:51,686 --> 00:38:54,216
♫ You can dance like no other woman

637
00:38:54,216 --> 00:38:55,236
♫ Here

638
00:38:55,236 --> 00:38:56,387
♫ In this world

639
00:38:56,387 --> 00:38:58,400
♫ You got rhythm in your heart

640
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:01,138
♫ And you got fire in your soul

641
00:39:01,138 --> 00:39:03,562
♫ Our ancestors dance for rain

642
00:39:03,562 --> 00:39:05,808
♫ While some dance to be free

643
00:39:05,808 --> 00:39:08,538
♫ So woman you're the greatest dancer

644
00:39:08,538 --> 00:39:10,878
♫ The world will ever see

645
00:39:10,878 --> 00:39:13,350
(banging)

646
00:39:13,350 --> 00:39:16,004
♫ Woman dance
(woman drowned out by radio)

647
00:39:16,004 --> 00:39:17,281
♫ Let me dance, dance, dance
- What?

648
00:39:17,281 --> 00:39:19,764
♫ Black woman dance
(woman drowned out by radio)

649
00:39:19,764 --> 00:39:20,597
- What?

650
00:39:23,803 --> 00:39:25,553
- Your lights are on.

651
00:39:31,898 --> 00:39:34,998
- [Voiceover] And a grapple to
short could be a double play.

652
00:39:34,998 --> 00:39:36,954
The flip to second, Jordan goes--

653
00:39:36,954 --> 00:39:39,983
(singing in foreign language)

654
00:39:39,983 --> 00:39:41,029
- [Voiceover] Play ends the inning.

655
00:39:41,029 --> 00:39:42,527
We've got one hit, no runs--

656
00:39:42,527 --> 00:39:44,495
(banging)

657
00:39:44,495 --> 00:39:48,328
(singing in foreign language)

658
00:39:55,389 --> 00:39:56,431
- Is that the guy?

659
00:39:56,431 --> 00:39:57,441
- Guys!

660
00:39:57,441 --> 00:39:59,256
Our case is an embarrassment.

661
00:39:59,256 --> 00:40:00,639
- We got it, Mr. Krug.

662
00:40:00,639 --> 00:40:01,472
We got it.

663
00:40:03,056 --> 00:40:05,639
(door squeaks)

664
00:40:14,190 --> 00:40:17,932
(car honking in distance)

665
00:40:17,932 --> 00:40:19,819
- Hello, boys.

666
00:40:19,819 --> 00:40:22,067
We're give tonight.

667
00:40:22,067 --> 00:40:23,829
The cigarettes will be in the truck.

668
00:40:23,829 --> 00:40:26,190
Park across the mall at 5:00,

669
00:40:26,190 --> 00:40:28,357
Jersey plates, understand?

670
00:40:35,029 --> 00:40:38,442
Now Boris, asking to ask
you to see the money.

671
00:40:38,442 --> 00:40:40,107
So we can do business
with civilized people.

672
00:40:40,107 --> 00:40:41,104
- No.

673
00:40:41,104 --> 00:40:43,354
No money 'til we see cigarettes.

674
00:40:43,354 --> 00:40:44,588
That's the way it is.

675
00:40:44,588 --> 00:40:46,611
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, that's right.

676
00:40:46,611 --> 00:40:48,160
Tell Mr. Boris that
we'll be there at 5:00,

677
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:51,412
like we agreed, all business up.

678
00:40:51,412 --> 00:40:53,076
- No fuckups.

679
00:40:53,076 --> 00:40:54,243
Okay, fuckups?

680
00:41:04,977 --> 00:41:05,863
- What was that?

681
00:41:05,863 --> 00:41:09,031
I thought we were doin'
business with Boris.

682
00:41:09,031 --> 00:41:10,431
- This whole thing makes me nervous.

683
00:41:10,431 --> 00:41:11,691
- Oh, come on, Ramon, stop.

684
00:41:11,691 --> 00:41:14,191
It's gonna be beautiful, okay?

685
00:41:17,277 --> 00:41:18,527
- [Ramon] Shit.

686
00:41:29,201 --> 00:41:32,575
(door squeaks and slams)

687
00:41:32,575 --> 00:41:35,158
(door squeaks)

688
00:41:41,358 --> 00:41:42,976
- [Josif] Stelu, my friend.

689
00:41:42,976 --> 00:41:44,188
- Josif.

690
00:41:44,188 --> 00:41:45,021
- How are you?

691
00:41:45,021 --> 00:41:46,461
(speaking in foreign language)

692
00:41:46,461 --> 00:41:47,628
- How are you.

693
00:41:48,665 --> 00:41:51,107
- I'm in a pinch, though.

694
00:41:51,107 --> 00:41:52,891
Listen, I hate to ask you,

695
00:41:52,891 --> 00:41:54,607
do you think I could have the money,

696
00:41:54,607 --> 00:41:56,267
my wife lent your wife yesterday?

697
00:41:56,267 --> 00:41:57,907
- Oh, Josif.

698
00:41:57,907 --> 00:42:00,038
We just borrow yesterday.

699
00:42:00,038 --> 00:42:02,391
It's my daughter's communion.

700
00:42:02,391 --> 00:42:03,636
- That's right.

701
00:42:03,636 --> 00:42:04,569
- Hey, have a drink, huh?

702
00:42:04,569 --> 00:42:05,423
- No.

703
00:42:05,423 --> 00:42:06,256
- Huh?

704
00:42:06,256 --> 00:42:07,901
- I'm okay, congratulations.

705
00:42:07,901 --> 00:42:08,734
- Okay, kiddo?

706
00:42:08,734 --> 00:42:09,567
- Yeah.

707
00:42:09,567 --> 00:42:10,400
- Huh?

708
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:11,233
- Yeah.

709
00:42:11,233 --> 00:42:12,066
(speaking in foreign language)

710
00:42:12,066 --> 00:42:12,899
Okay.

711
00:42:12,899 --> 00:42:13,732
- Be good.

712
00:42:17,638 --> 00:42:18,471
- Fuck!

713
00:42:19,473 --> 00:42:20,306
- Ah ...

714
00:42:20,306 --> 00:42:22,316
(mellow music)

715
00:42:22,316 --> 00:42:26,066
I'm reminded of the time
we were shooting ...

716
00:42:27,127 --> 00:42:29,358
- He fled India because
he couldn't find a part.

717
00:42:29,358 --> 00:42:30,330
- You don't know that.

718
00:42:30,330 --> 00:42:31,481
- Has he looked in the mirror?

719
00:42:31,481 --> 00:42:33,389
Does he know how difficult it is here?

720
00:42:33,389 --> 00:42:35,257
- Mr. Al Pacino may call him.

721
00:42:35,257 --> 00:42:36,090
- He will?

722
00:42:37,256 --> 00:42:40,517
- [Vikram] For my
contributions to the Indian

723
00:42:40,517 --> 00:42:42,068
Chandra?

724
00:42:42,068 --> 00:42:42,901
Scotch!

725
00:42:45,964 --> 00:42:47,131
- I'll get it.

726
00:42:49,284 --> 00:42:50,471
- [Vikram] Al Pacino.

727
00:42:50,471 --> 00:42:51,637
- [Ladies] Al Pacino?

728
00:42:51,637 --> 00:42:54,232
- [Vikram] We were waiting for a taxi cab,

729
00:42:54,232 --> 00:42:56,315
on a miserable afternoon.

730
00:42:58,013 --> 00:42:59,525
We found ourselves--

731
00:42:59,525 --> 00:43:01,863
- Bipin, he is taking over our home.

732
00:43:01,863 --> 00:43:04,419
It's either him or me.

733
00:43:04,419 --> 00:43:08,712
I'll take the children and
go to a motel or something.

734
00:43:08,712 --> 00:43:12,100
- Chandra, let's not fight this weekend.

735
00:43:12,100 --> 00:43:14,252
You were so delighted when he first came.

736
00:43:14,252 --> 00:43:16,517
- Yes, but I had no idea
that he was going to

737
00:43:16,517 --> 00:43:18,158
treat us like his next champas.

738
00:43:18,158 --> 00:43:19,305
I bend backwards too,

739
00:43:19,305 --> 00:43:20,552
'cause then all he does is, "Chandra!"

740
00:43:20,552 --> 00:43:21,499
He say "Chandra!"

741
00:43:21,499 --> 00:43:23,044
I don't have to take this nonsense.

742
00:43:23,044 --> 00:43:25,044
(cries)

743
00:43:30,686 --> 00:43:32,269
- [Vikram] Chandra?

744
00:43:34,102 --> 00:43:36,882
It seems we have finished the nuts.

745
00:43:36,882 --> 00:43:38,595
- There is nothing left to eat.

746
00:43:38,595 --> 00:43:39,902
The house is empty.

747
00:43:39,902 --> 00:43:42,022
You've eaten it clean.

748
00:43:42,022 --> 00:43:44,830
- Bipin, do you let her
talk to you like this?

749
00:43:44,830 --> 00:43:46,206
- I'll go to the corner.

750
00:43:46,206 --> 00:43:47,404
- No!

751
00:43:47,404 --> 00:43:50,054
(speaking in foreign language)

752
00:43:50,054 --> 00:43:51,640
I'll go.

753
00:43:51,640 --> 00:43:53,473
I need some fresh air.

754
00:43:54,761 --> 00:43:58,594
(singing in foreign language)

755
00:44:00,140 --> 00:44:01,473
- Sorry, Vikram.

756
00:44:02,424 --> 00:44:04,091
This isn't like her.

757
00:44:12,628 --> 00:44:14,128
- [Little Boy] No.

758
00:44:25,396 --> 00:44:26,751
- Yes, hello.

759
00:44:26,751 --> 00:44:28,920
Yes, hello, this is Sylvie Otti.

760
00:44:28,920 --> 00:44:31,239
I am the designer who called the ...

761
00:44:31,239 --> 00:44:32,680
Yes.

762
00:44:32,680 --> 00:44:34,416
Yes, no I would like to speak

763
00:44:34,416 --> 00:44:35,999
with Mrs. Bruckham.

764
00:44:37,386 --> 00:44:40,642
Oh, no listen, I've left 20 messages.

765
00:44:40,642 --> 00:44:41,962
I've started ...

766
00:44:41,962 --> 00:44:43,496
Hello?

767
00:44:43,496 --> 00:44:44,329
Hello?

768
00:44:46,247 --> 00:44:48,747
(phone beeps)

769
00:44:51,853 --> 00:44:54,520
Listen, I don't appreciate
you hanging up on me.

770
00:44:54,520 --> 00:44:57,174
And I don't like your
tone of voice, you hear?

771
00:44:57,174 --> 00:44:58,007
Asshole.

772
00:44:59,514 --> 00:45:01,514
(sighs)

773
00:45:08,967 --> 00:45:11,550
(mellow music)

774
00:45:18,856 --> 00:45:19,689
Hello?

775
00:45:20,823 --> 00:45:24,740
(speaking in foreign language)

776
00:45:40,889 --> 00:45:42,334
(bubble wrap pops)

777
00:45:42,334 --> 00:45:46,251
(speaking in foreign language)

778
00:46:08,733 --> 00:46:11,624
- But her thighs are huge.

779
00:46:11,624 --> 00:46:13,270
Jello.

780
00:46:13,270 --> 00:46:14,103
What?

781
00:46:15,407 --> 00:46:17,240
Yeah, um, I better go.

782
00:46:18,276 --> 00:46:19,109
Yeah, bye.

783
00:46:22,013 --> 00:46:23,680
Don't start with me.

784
00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:26,108
I shouldn't even be here today.

785
00:46:26,108 --> 00:46:27,358
- Was that him?

786
00:46:36,811 --> 00:46:39,228
(door slams)

787
00:46:43,306 --> 00:46:45,889
(upbeat music)

788
00:46:47,968 --> 00:46:52,135
(hoarsely speaking in foreign language)

789
00:46:52,992 --> 00:46:55,159
- The two sides of a coin;

790
00:46:56,381 --> 00:46:57,881
both shine pretty,

791
00:46:58,841 --> 00:47:00,961
but only one side

792
00:47:00,961 --> 00:47:02,628
will bring you luck.

793
00:47:03,543 --> 00:47:07,376
(singing in foreign language)

794
00:47:12,735 --> 00:47:15,075
Wear this white string

795
00:47:15,075 --> 00:47:17,115
around your finger,

796
00:47:17,115 --> 00:47:20,208
for it bounds your desires.

797
00:47:20,208 --> 00:47:22,726
It's there as a reminder

798
00:47:22,726 --> 00:47:24,809
of what you truly desire.

799
00:47:28,131 --> 00:47:30,254
- [Voiceover] Now the
2-1 pitch on the way.

800
00:47:30,254 --> 00:47:32,684
Wild pitch into the dirt, bouncing away.

801
00:47:32,684 --> 00:47:33,738
Here come Jeffrey Sis--

802
00:47:33,738 --> 00:47:34,571
- Why you so edgy?

803
00:47:34,571 --> 00:47:36,910
You got money on this game?

804
00:47:36,910 --> 00:47:38,108
Wait a minute.

805
00:47:38,108 --> 00:47:39,720
Oh, no.

806
00:47:39,720 --> 00:47:41,133
- What are you, my wife?

807
00:47:41,133 --> 00:47:45,050
- Tell me you don't got
the money on this game.

808
00:47:47,026 --> 00:47:49,106
Oh, Christ, Jesus!

809
00:47:49,106 --> 00:47:50,953
The fucking Russians will kill us!

810
00:47:50,953 --> 00:47:52,051
They'll kill us!

811
00:47:52,051 --> 00:47:52,965
- [Josif] Russians, Russians, Russians.

812
00:47:52,965 --> 00:47:53,798
- We'll be dead!

813
00:47:53,798 --> 00:47:55,465
Dead mother fuckers!

814
00:47:57,247 --> 00:47:58,996
Dead, dead, dead, man!

815
00:47:58,996 --> 00:48:00,053
- [Josif] What's a matter?

816
00:48:00,053 --> 00:48:01,114
- [Ramon] Promise me!

817
00:48:01,114 --> 00:48:02,828
- Ramon, you look like an old man.

818
00:48:02,828 --> 00:48:03,661
Would you calm down?

819
00:48:03,661 --> 00:48:04,848
It's gonna be fine.

820
00:48:04,848 --> 00:48:06,286
Do you trust me?

821
00:48:06,286 --> 00:48:07,619
Do you trust me?

822
00:48:08,924 --> 00:48:11,129
- Tell me the truth.

823
00:48:11,129 --> 00:48:12,518
- Elena's pregnant.

824
00:48:12,518 --> 00:48:13,801
- [Ramon] What?

825
00:48:13,801 --> 00:48:14,948
- She's pregnant.

826
00:48:14,948 --> 00:48:16,176
- [Ramon] Really?

827
00:48:16,176 --> 00:48:19,179
- I found her pregnancy
test kit in the freezer.

828
00:48:19,179 --> 00:48:23,346
(speaking in foreign language)
(somber music)

829
00:48:49,708 --> 00:48:51,791
- Small taste of heaven.

830
00:48:51,791 --> 00:48:53,006
Ranch-style Tudor,

831
00:48:53,006 --> 00:48:55,803
1.3 acre lot, central air,

832
00:48:55,803 --> 00:48:58,548
and fully automated sprinkler system.

833
00:48:58,548 --> 00:49:00,369
It's a nice house.

834
00:49:00,369 --> 00:49:01,369
- It's mine.

835
00:49:02,535 --> 00:49:04,035
It's gonna happen.

836
00:49:09,108 --> 00:49:12,108
- [Mr. Krug] Guys, we got customers.

837
00:49:16,047 --> 00:49:18,630
(door slams)

838
00:49:26,782 --> 00:49:30,949
(laughing)
(phone busy signal beeping)

839
00:49:32,303 --> 00:49:36,136
(singing in foreign language)

840
00:49:38,465 --> 00:49:39,298
- Damn.

841
00:49:45,707 --> 00:49:48,290
- Chandra, how nice to see you.

842
00:49:49,431 --> 00:49:51,098
What'll it be today?

843
00:49:53,614 --> 00:49:54,947
- Cocktail nuts.

844
00:49:56,637 --> 00:49:58,054
- You look tired.

845
00:49:59,936 --> 00:50:02,535
- I've worked all week.

846
00:50:02,535 --> 00:50:04,975
On my feet most of the day.

847
00:50:04,975 --> 00:50:08,114
I was looking forward to a quiet weekend,

848
00:50:08,114 --> 00:50:10,264
but my home's full of people.

849
00:50:10,264 --> 00:50:13,181
- Having a party, didn't invite us?

850
00:50:14,414 --> 00:50:16,831
- [Chandra] I wasn't invited.

851
00:50:49,738 --> 00:50:50,905
- $8.25, dear.

852
00:50:53,628 --> 00:50:54,711
Are you okay?

853
00:51:01,430 --> 00:51:03,680
Chandra, please, take this.

854
00:51:06,769 --> 00:51:08,173
- Thank you.

855
00:51:08,173 --> 00:51:09,848
- [Clerk] And tell him I'm a big fan,

856
00:51:09,848 --> 00:51:11,765
of Far Cry from Sadaam.

857
00:51:14,265 --> 00:51:17,015
(birds chirping)

858
00:51:36,335 --> 00:51:40,502
(crying)
(somber music)

859
00:52:08,324 --> 00:52:10,907
(cars honking)

860
00:52:15,981 --> 00:52:18,572
(laughing)

861
00:52:18,572 --> 00:52:20,178
- Don't touch the car!

862
00:52:20,178 --> 00:52:21,199
Go home!

863
00:52:21,199 --> 00:52:22,528
Don't make me come get you!

864
00:52:22,528 --> 00:52:26,695
(laughing)
(chanting in foreign language)

865
00:52:29,939 --> 00:52:32,439
(funky music)

866
00:52:35,657 --> 00:52:36,490
- Ah ...

867
00:52:38,908 --> 00:52:40,075
Down, sweetie.

868
00:52:46,493 --> 00:52:47,886
Ow, you're hurting me.

869
00:52:47,886 --> 00:52:51,172
- Have I told you how much I love you?

870
00:52:51,172 --> 00:52:52,324
- Not since last month

871
00:52:52,324 --> 00:52:55,492
when you had me go down to
your job to lie for you.

872
00:52:55,492 --> 00:52:56,992
- Ooo, well, I do.

873
00:53:06,248 --> 00:53:07,498
- That tickles.

874
00:53:10,244 --> 00:53:12,880
- Oh, are you up to something?

875
00:53:12,880 --> 00:53:14,550
- Why do I have to be up to something

876
00:53:14,550 --> 00:53:16,929
to tell my wife that I love her?

877
00:53:16,929 --> 00:53:18,016
- Hmm ...

878
00:53:18,016 --> 00:53:18,933
I know you.

879
00:53:21,227 --> 00:53:23,271
- I'm feeling romantic today.

880
00:53:23,271 --> 00:53:24,104
- Hmm ...

881
00:53:24,104 --> 00:53:27,388
- When I come in and I
see you lying there all

882
00:53:27,388 --> 00:53:28,638
sexy and thing.

883
00:53:30,299 --> 00:53:32,128
And I think to myself,

884
00:53:32,128 --> 00:53:34,878
"Good god you have a sexy woman."

885
00:53:36,229 --> 00:53:39,144
And lets the boys have a kiss.

886
00:53:39,144 --> 00:53:40,616
- Yes.

887
00:53:40,616 --> 00:53:42,866
(moaning)

888
00:53:56,004 --> 00:53:58,328
- Are you goin' someplace tonight?

889
00:53:58,328 --> 00:53:59,161
- No, why?

890
00:54:02,183 --> 00:54:03,616
- Sweets,

891
00:54:03,616 --> 00:54:05,975
there's a rooftop party downtown.

892
00:54:05,975 --> 00:54:06,808
- Go on.

893
00:54:08,094 --> 00:54:10,177
Yeah, that might be nice.

894
00:54:11,520 --> 00:54:12,353
- I know.

895
00:54:14,842 --> 00:54:17,259
Me and the boys, wanna drive.

896
00:54:19,282 --> 00:54:20,115
- Boys?

897
00:54:20,115 --> 00:54:20,973
- Where you goin' woman?

898
00:54:20,973 --> 00:54:22,161
- Get off me, man.

899
00:54:22,161 --> 00:54:24,189
- But, don't do it.

900
00:54:24,189 --> 00:54:25,346
- You talk all sweet to me,

901
00:54:25,346 --> 00:54:27,207
and me take that and get
all wet between the legs,

902
00:54:27,207 --> 00:54:28,210
and now!

903
00:54:28,210 --> 00:54:29,851
- Don't raise your voice.

904
00:54:29,851 --> 00:54:30,684
- I will!

905
00:54:31,573 --> 00:54:32,671
- The neighbors will hear.

906
00:54:32,671 --> 00:54:34,700
- [Brenda] My mother say,
"Be careful of that one.

907
00:54:34,700 --> 00:54:37,801
"He's liable to go soft in the head."

908
00:54:37,801 --> 00:54:39,445
- Who you callin'?

909
00:54:39,445 --> 00:54:41,156
Woman, give me that phone!

910
00:54:41,156 --> 00:54:42,576
Give me that phone!

911
00:54:42,576 --> 00:54:43,663
(busy signal beeps)

912
00:54:43,663 --> 00:54:44,706
Give me that!

913
00:54:44,706 --> 00:54:45,959
- You want the phone?

914
00:54:45,959 --> 00:54:47,209
You better run!

915
00:54:48,962 --> 00:54:50,629
You better run, man!

916
00:54:52,421 --> 00:54:53,671
You better run!

917
00:54:56,479 --> 00:54:57,838
- [Errol] Watch one day,

918
00:54:57,838 --> 00:54:59,714
one day that woman, she gonna have kids.

919
00:54:59,714 --> 00:55:04,059
(all kids talking and laughing)

920
00:55:04,059 --> 00:55:04,912
- [Voiceover] I'm telling you.

921
00:55:04,912 --> 00:55:06,348
You have to feel for this Mets squad.

922
00:55:06,348 --> 00:55:07,705
They're in the middle of a losing streak,

923
00:55:07,705 --> 00:55:10,670
and just can't seem to
win for losing these days.

924
00:55:10,670 --> 00:55:14,159
It seems the heart has just
gone right out of them.

925
00:55:14,159 --> 00:55:16,364
- [Mr. Krug] Hey, Romo?

926
00:55:16,364 --> 00:55:18,116
(speaking in foreign language)

927
00:55:18,116 --> 00:55:18,949
Come on.

928
00:55:18,949 --> 00:55:20,698
- [Voiceover] And he
no chance in the world.

929
00:55:20,698 --> 00:55:22,202
Alright, that's the
fourth walk of the game

930
00:55:22,202 --> 00:55:23,548
by Dave Malicki.

931
00:55:23,548 --> 00:55:26,282
Struggling a little bit with
his control as we can see.

932
00:55:26,282 --> 00:55:27,802
Now the Phillies have runners to corners,

933
00:55:27,802 --> 00:55:28,918
with no men down,

934
00:55:28,918 --> 00:55:30,791
and up comes Greg Jeffries.

935
00:55:30,791 --> 00:55:33,069
We'll recall he used to
be a Met some time back,

936
00:55:33,069 --> 00:55:37,273
a rather contentious stay
at the New York team.

937
00:55:37,273 --> 00:55:40,420
The pinch to Greg Jeffries,
a slider low and away.

938
00:55:40,420 --> 00:55:41,253
One ball--

939
00:55:41,253 --> 00:55:42,086
- Two dollars.

940
00:55:42,086 --> 00:55:44,902
- [Voiceover] the count to Mr. Jeffries.

941
00:55:44,902 --> 00:55:46,606
Usually falls behind on Jeffries,

942
00:55:46,606 --> 00:55:48,711
two balls one strike.

943
00:55:48,711 --> 00:55:51,514
Jeffries waiting on the 2-0 pitch.

944
00:55:51,514 --> 00:55:53,857
- [Mr. Krug] Hotter than hell today.

945
00:55:53,857 --> 00:55:55,696
You can fry an egg on the sidewalk.

946
00:55:55,696 --> 00:55:57,555
- [Voiceover] And it's in
the dirt, bouncing away.

947
00:55:57,555 --> 00:55:58,780
Here comes Jordan to score,

948
00:55:58,780 --> 00:56:00,287
and he does.

949
00:56:00,287 --> 00:56:01,545
And on a wild pitch,

950
00:56:01,545 --> 00:56:03,635
the Phillies go up five nothing.

951
00:56:03,635 --> 00:56:04,856
Nationwide,

952
00:56:04,856 --> 00:56:07,512
the conversation's of
the deadliest death heat.

953
00:56:07,512 --> 00:56:09,278
For all your insurance needs--

954
00:56:09,278 --> 00:56:12,660
- Can you picture me that
age, still working here?

955
00:56:12,660 --> 00:56:13,993
I'd kill myself.

956
00:56:14,878 --> 00:56:17,526
- All these years hacking pork.

957
00:56:17,526 --> 00:56:19,879
What's he got to show for it?

958
00:56:19,879 --> 00:56:21,633
- [Voiceover] Having thrown
though several innings

959
00:56:21,633 --> 00:56:22,802
straight here on a hot

960
00:56:22,802 --> 00:56:25,041
and very humid Saturday afternoon.

961
00:56:25,041 --> 00:56:27,958
(melancholy music)

962
00:57:16,808 --> 00:57:18,167
- I hear what you're saying, sweetie,

963
00:57:18,167 --> 00:57:19,883
but understand my scheduling needs.

964
00:57:19,883 --> 00:57:21,753
I have to draw the line somewhere.

965
00:57:21,753 --> 00:57:23,701
(shouting in distance)

966
00:57:23,701 --> 00:57:24,972
Frank!

967
00:57:24,972 --> 00:57:26,129
I can't hear myself.

968
00:57:26,129 --> 00:57:28,438
What the hell is going on out there?

969
00:57:28,438 --> 00:57:29,992
- I'm only trying to get
an appointment, Fernando.

970
00:57:29,992 --> 00:57:31,010
Get out of my way.

971
00:57:31,010 --> 00:57:31,960
Are you crazy?

972
00:57:31,960 --> 00:57:34,460
- I'll talk to later, bye bye, sweetie.

973
00:57:34,460 --> 00:57:35,319
- Frank!

974
00:57:35,319 --> 00:57:36,152
Let her go.

975
00:57:36,152 --> 00:57:37,348
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

976
00:57:37,348 --> 00:57:38,289
- What's going on here?

977
00:57:38,289 --> 00:57:39,816
- Mrs. Bruckham, I've been
trying to get an appointment

978
00:57:39,816 --> 00:57:41,719
for a month, and I'm really--

979
00:57:41,719 --> 00:57:43,089
- So you just barge in?

980
00:57:43,089 --> 00:57:47,172
I hope you won't be too
upset if I call security.

981
00:57:48,907 --> 00:57:50,500
Do I know you?

982
00:57:50,500 --> 00:57:52,618
- Yes, we've met.

983
00:57:52,618 --> 00:57:54,035
- Oh my god, yes!

984
00:57:54,993 --> 00:57:57,576
Little Sylvie all grown up, oh!

985
00:57:59,721 --> 00:58:01,605
You look splendid!

986
00:58:01,605 --> 00:58:04,689
I should have recognized your temperament.

987
00:58:04,689 --> 00:58:06,630
How is your mom?

988
00:58:06,630 --> 00:58:11,359
Did you see her fantastic
collection on your way in?

989
00:58:11,359 --> 00:58:12,192
Sit, sit!

990
00:58:13,629 --> 00:58:15,013
I apologize.

991
00:58:15,013 --> 00:58:17,020
If I had only known.

992
00:58:17,020 --> 00:58:21,415
Sylvie, oh Sylvie, you've
got Frank all worked up.

993
00:58:21,415 --> 00:58:25,280
I'll probably have to give
him the rest of the day off.

994
00:58:25,280 --> 00:58:27,780
Oh, is that your book, Sylvie?

995
00:58:30,072 --> 00:58:31,946
How adorable.

996
00:58:31,946 --> 00:58:35,409
A designer following in
your mother's footsteps.

997
00:58:35,409 --> 00:58:37,217
Why didn't you mention a name?

998
00:58:37,217 --> 00:58:39,773
I would have seen you toot sweet.

999
00:58:39,773 --> 00:58:42,724
- Here I take the feminine on the inside,

1000
00:58:42,724 --> 00:58:44,383
and then throw it with a masculine edge.

1001
00:58:44,383 --> 00:58:47,897
- Do you know I was your
mother's fitting model?

1002
00:58:47,897 --> 00:58:49,647
A perfect size eight.

1003
00:58:51,162 --> 00:58:53,315
- Instead on this other page,

1004
00:58:53,315 --> 00:58:56,366
I make a more body conscious
silhouette that can--

1005
00:58:56,366 --> 00:58:59,078
- It's a wretched business, fashion.

1006
00:58:59,078 --> 00:59:01,379
My advice to you, sweetie:

1007
00:59:01,379 --> 00:59:02,840
run!

1008
00:59:02,840 --> 00:59:03,973
- No, please hang on to it.

1009
00:59:03,973 --> 00:59:05,284
- No, no, you'll need it.

1010
00:59:05,284 --> 00:59:08,344
It'll probably get lost in all this chaos.

1011
00:59:08,344 --> 00:59:10,061
- Mrs. Bruckham, I really--

1012
00:59:10,061 --> 00:59:12,894
- [Frank] The lead from DK on one.

1013
00:59:14,899 --> 00:59:16,183
- Yeah.

1014
00:59:16,183 --> 00:59:17,391
Yeah, listen, sweetie,

1015
00:59:17,391 --> 00:59:19,474
we've been all over that.

1016
00:59:20,402 --> 00:59:21,235
Hold on.

1017
00:59:22,147 --> 00:59:23,195
Sylvie,

1018
00:59:23,195 --> 00:59:26,103
Yuki Shimamura will be
in town until tomorrow.

1019
00:59:26,103 --> 00:59:27,795
She's a buyer for one of the biggest

1020
00:59:27,795 --> 00:59:29,489
department stores in Tokyo.

1021
00:59:29,489 --> 00:59:31,348
She'll be an important contact for you.

1022
00:59:31,348 --> 00:59:32,482
Take her to dinner tonight.

1023
00:59:32,482 --> 00:59:34,649
Don't let her pay, sweetie.

1024
00:59:34,649 --> 00:59:37,002
Frank will set it up on your way out.

1025
00:59:37,002 --> 00:59:39,027
Bye bye darling.

1026
00:59:39,027 --> 00:59:40,881
Kisses to mama.

1027
00:59:40,881 --> 00:59:42,192
Uh huh.

1028
00:59:42,192 --> 00:59:44,775
(mellow music)

1029
01:00:04,646 --> 01:00:06,121
- [Chandra] What's the matter?

1030
01:00:06,121 --> 01:00:08,611
- Nothing, it was just
getting too hot inside.

1031
01:00:08,611 --> 01:00:11,351
- So now he's thrown you
out of your own home.

1032
01:00:11,351 --> 01:00:12,700
- It's a beautiful day.

1033
01:00:12,700 --> 01:00:14,978
- It's 100 degrees.

1034
01:00:14,978 --> 01:00:17,983
I'm not going to stand for this.

1035
01:00:17,983 --> 01:00:19,695
He hasn't set foot outside of this house!

1036
01:00:19,695 --> 01:00:21,109
- Please don't do this.

1037
01:00:21,109 --> 01:00:25,276
(party-goers chattering)
(singing in foreign language)

1038
01:00:37,531 --> 01:00:38,478
- Please out!

1039
01:00:38,478 --> 01:00:40,171
I want you to leave, please.

1040
01:00:40,171 --> 01:00:42,004
It's nothing personal.

1041
01:00:43,041 --> 01:00:45,021
(record scratches)

1042
01:00:45,021 --> 01:00:45,854
Out!

1043
01:00:46,854 --> 01:00:50,551
(bottles breaking)

1044
01:00:50,551 --> 01:00:52,054
- Poom!

1045
01:00:52,054 --> 01:00:53,471
Poom, poom, poom,

1046
01:00:55,697 --> 01:00:56,614
poom, poom,

1047
01:00:57,878 --> 01:00:58,795
poom, poom.

1048
01:00:59,852 --> 01:01:00,923
- [Voiceover] A fly ball deep to left.

1049
01:01:00,923 --> 01:01:03,280
It's up there, it's on its way, gone!

1050
01:01:03,280 --> 01:01:05,771
A homerun into the kiddie park.

1051
01:01:05,771 --> 01:01:06,604
- What are you doing?

1052
01:01:06,604 --> 01:01:08,687
- They're fuckin' losing.

1053
01:01:11,290 --> 01:01:12,668
What are you doing?

1054
01:01:12,668 --> 01:01:14,598
- It's a loan, I'll pay
him back before he notices.

1055
01:01:14,598 --> 01:01:15,789
- [Ramon] Are you crazy, no!

1056
01:01:15,789 --> 01:01:17,204
You're gonna mess everything up!

1057
01:01:17,204 --> 01:01:18,181
Are you crazy, man?

1058
01:01:18,181 --> 01:01:19,014
No!

1059
01:01:19,014 --> 01:01:19,847
- You wanna tell that to Boris.

1060
01:01:19,847 --> 01:01:20,680
Do you?

1061
01:01:20,680 --> 01:01:22,695
- Hey, what's goin' on here?

1062
01:01:22,695 --> 01:01:24,846
What is it, half a day today?

1063
01:01:24,846 --> 01:01:25,806
- Miss Patreski called,

1064
01:01:25,806 --> 01:01:28,033
she says she needs another chop.

1065
01:01:28,033 --> 01:01:30,007
- Put it in the meat
locker with the other.

1066
01:01:30,007 --> 01:01:31,734
And remember, Joe.

1067
01:01:31,734 --> 01:01:32,567
Remember.

1068
01:01:33,603 --> 01:01:37,191
Drop it off on your way home, huh?

1069
01:01:37,191 --> 01:01:41,281
(singing in foreign language)

1070
01:01:41,281 --> 01:01:43,676
- I've been locked out
of my Benz all morning.

1071
01:01:43,676 --> 01:01:45,109
Where are my keys?

1072
01:01:45,109 --> 01:01:47,776
(keys jingling)

1073
01:01:50,305 --> 01:01:52,922
(smacking)

1074
01:01:52,922 --> 01:01:54,942
Stop, they will come out.

1075
01:01:54,942 --> 01:01:55,775
Stop.

1076
01:01:58,566 --> 01:02:00,851
(sighs)

1077
01:02:00,851 --> 01:02:01,891
- Bye the way--

1078
01:02:01,891 --> 01:02:03,580
- No, Sylvie.

1079
01:02:03,580 --> 01:02:05,247
I'm broke, flat out.

1080
01:02:07,639 --> 01:02:09,861
- You don't think I can pay it back?

1081
01:02:09,861 --> 01:02:11,968
Look, I have to meet this Japanese buyer,

1082
01:02:11,968 --> 01:02:13,425
a very important buyer.

1083
01:02:13,425 --> 01:02:16,134
- I would be impressed if that was true.

1084
01:02:16,134 --> 01:02:18,301
- Fuck you, it is true.

1085
01:02:18,301 --> 01:02:21,522
Please, I don't wanna blow it.

1086
01:02:21,522 --> 01:02:24,224
- I can't keep bailing you out.

1087
01:02:24,224 --> 01:02:25,726
Why don't you ask your mom?

1088
01:02:25,726 --> 01:02:26,559
- Ouch.

1089
01:02:26,559 --> 01:02:28,489
I'm asking you.

1090
01:02:28,489 --> 01:02:29,854
- I'm still angry at you.

1091
01:02:29,854 --> 01:02:30,687
- What?

1092
01:02:30,687 --> 01:02:31,979
- I'm still angry at you.

1093
01:02:31,979 --> 01:02:33,479
- Oh, come on, baby.

1094
01:02:33,479 --> 01:02:35,229
Come on, get over it.

1095
01:02:37,228 --> 01:02:41,061
♫ I don't ♫

1096
01:02:41,948 --> 01:02:42,874
- Take the pack.

1097
01:02:42,874 --> 01:02:44,343
- No, I'm quitting.

1098
01:02:44,343 --> 01:02:45,570
- Again?

1099
01:02:45,570 --> 01:02:48,158
♫ And when I sing

1100
01:02:48,158 --> 01:02:51,991
♫ And you ♫

1101
01:03:08,395 --> 01:03:09,438
- Whadda ya do to me?

1102
01:03:09,438 --> 01:03:10,588
Come here!

1103
01:03:10,588 --> 01:03:11,544
Thief!

1104
01:03:11,544 --> 01:03:13,127
Thief, theif!

1105
01:03:13,127 --> 01:03:14,460
Help!

1106
01:03:14,460 --> 01:03:15,293
Get him, Errol!

1107
01:03:15,293 --> 01:03:17,960
- I got him!
- [Brenda] Get him!

1108
01:03:30,316 --> 01:03:31,314
- Did you get it?

1109
01:03:31,314 --> 01:03:32,818
- No, that woman's strong.

1110
01:03:32,818 --> 01:03:33,855
- You didn't get it?

1111
01:03:33,855 --> 01:03:35,113
- Ma, did you see that?

1112
01:03:35,113 --> 01:03:36,061
You see that?

1113
01:03:36,061 --> 01:03:36,894
- My god!

1114
01:03:36,894 --> 01:03:37,727
- You got my money?

1115
01:03:37,727 --> 01:03:38,888
- Money, for what?

1116
01:03:38,888 --> 01:03:40,204
Running fast?

1117
01:03:40,204 --> 01:03:41,164
Screaming?

1118
01:03:41,164 --> 01:03:42,704
No, I don't have your money!

1119
01:03:42,704 --> 01:03:43,537
Go on now!

1120
01:03:43,537 --> 01:03:44,827
Go on!

1121
01:03:44,827 --> 01:03:46,482
Go on before I make it for real.

1122
01:03:46,482 --> 01:03:47,315
Go on!

1123
01:03:49,892 --> 01:03:52,142
God, the key, get the key!

1124
01:03:54,786 --> 01:03:55,619
Brenda!

1125
01:03:57,706 --> 01:03:58,571
You alright, honey?

1126
01:03:58,571 --> 01:03:59,421
- Yes.

1127
01:03:59,421 --> 01:04:00,293
- Why?

1128
01:04:00,293 --> 01:04:01,150
- Thank you, baby.

1129
01:04:01,150 --> 01:04:02,205
- Good thing I was here.

1130
01:04:02,205 --> 01:04:03,288
- Yes, it is.

1131
01:04:04,391 --> 01:04:07,066
- Why them young kids today, man?

1132
01:04:07,066 --> 01:04:08,840
- Thank you, baby.

1133
01:04:08,840 --> 01:04:10,796
Oh, god, you saw it didn't you?

1134
01:04:10,796 --> 01:04:12,148
You saw it.

1135
01:04:12,148 --> 01:04:14,149
Oh god, thank goodness.

1136
01:04:14,149 --> 01:04:16,732
(mellow music)

1137
01:04:27,408 --> 01:04:29,741
- And did you see that girl?

1138
01:04:32,108 --> 01:04:34,552
I better go, really.

1139
01:04:34,552 --> 01:04:36,452
- But really, (mumbles).

1140
01:04:36,452 --> 01:04:39,202
(dramatic music)

1141
01:04:44,407 --> 01:04:46,574
(moaning)

1142
01:05:00,298 --> 01:05:03,131
(dishes clanking)

1143
01:05:18,354 --> 01:05:20,521
- You tell him, Bipin Raj.

1144
01:05:24,643 --> 01:05:25,476
Tell him.

1145
01:05:26,846 --> 01:05:28,570
- [Voiceover] Kanu Chuahan

1146
01:05:28,570 --> 01:05:30,801
and Rajsun Entertainment present

1147
01:05:30,801 --> 01:05:32,218
Rangeele Dilwale!

1148
01:05:34,022 --> 01:05:35,619
- Look at this.

1149
01:05:35,619 --> 01:05:38,536
Ridiculous, these stadium concerts.

1150
01:05:39,894 --> 01:05:43,076
In my day it was much more intimate,

1151
01:05:43,076 --> 01:05:44,076
respectable.

1152
01:05:44,992 --> 01:05:46,788
It's rubbish.

1153
01:05:46,788 --> 01:05:48,371
Where's the talent?

1154
01:05:50,350 --> 01:05:54,267
(speaking in foreign language)

1155
01:05:56,205 --> 01:05:59,388
- Something on your mind, brother?

1156
01:05:59,388 --> 01:06:03,305
(speaking in foreign language)

1157
01:06:05,900 --> 01:06:06,733
- I know.

1158
01:06:08,262 --> 01:06:09,095
I know.

1159
01:06:10,852 --> 01:06:12,698
- It's Chandra.

1160
01:06:12,698 --> 01:06:13,531
She, she feels--

1161
01:06:13,531 --> 01:06:16,606
- You are a very lucky
man, very lucky man.

1162
01:06:16,606 --> 01:06:17,439
- Me?

1163
01:06:19,250 --> 01:06:23,797
A delivery driver with a
tiny house on Staten Island.

1164
01:06:23,797 --> 01:06:27,986
(speaking in foreign language)

1165
01:06:27,986 --> 01:06:30,910
- I remember the first role you ever had.

1166
01:06:30,910 --> 01:06:32,867
Cho-tu and the little brother.

1167
01:06:32,867 --> 01:06:34,924
You were only on the
screen for a few moments,

1168
01:06:34,924 --> 01:06:37,490
but we applauded so loud and long,

1169
01:06:37,490 --> 01:06:39,325
we missed the rest of the film.

1170
01:06:39,325 --> 01:06:42,094
(laughing)

1171
01:06:42,094 --> 01:06:43,175
- How do you remember that?

1172
01:06:43,175 --> 01:06:45,730
You were so young when I made that film.

1173
01:06:45,730 --> 01:06:48,337
- I remember everything you did.

1174
01:06:48,337 --> 01:06:49,254
Everything.

1175
01:06:52,219 --> 01:06:53,969
- Okay, tell me this.

1176
01:06:55,565 --> 01:07:00,089
What ever happened to that
blue cap I gave you, hmm?

1177
01:07:00,089 --> 01:07:02,682
I thought you'd never take it off.

1178
01:07:02,682 --> 01:07:06,765
I began to wonder if you
had any hair beneath it.

1179
01:07:08,480 --> 01:07:10,063
- I don't remember.

1180
01:07:16,314 --> 01:07:17,647
- Ma don't know.

1181
01:07:20,454 --> 01:07:21,287
- Yep,

1182
01:07:22,314 --> 01:07:24,481
she remembered everything.

1183
01:07:25,315 --> 01:07:26,148
- Yeah.

1184
01:07:37,268 --> 01:07:39,018
I'll talk to Chandra.

1185
01:07:40,924 --> 01:07:43,007
We'll work something out.

1186
01:07:48,464 --> 01:07:51,160
(phone ringing)

1187
01:07:51,160 --> 01:07:53,762
- Ridgewood Pork Store, Albani speaking.

1188
01:07:53,762 --> 01:07:56,138
Ah, Leny, how are you?

1189
01:07:56,138 --> 01:07:57,888
Ah, you're goin' out?

1190
01:07:58,830 --> 01:08:00,530
That's great.

1191
01:08:00,530 --> 01:08:02,709
Josif, it's Leny,

1192
01:08:02,709 --> 01:08:04,918
she wants to know what to wear tonight.

1193
01:08:04,918 --> 01:08:06,383
- Tell her my favorite.

1194
01:08:06,383 --> 01:08:08,296
- [Mr. Krug] He says to wear his favorite.

1195
01:08:08,296 --> 01:08:09,146
(laughs)

1196
01:08:09,146 --> 01:08:10,322
Okay bye, Leny.

1197
01:08:10,322 --> 01:08:11,340
- What?

1198
01:08:11,340 --> 01:08:12,173
- Nothing.

1199
01:08:14,536 --> 01:08:17,036
(phone rings)

1200
01:08:19,115 --> 01:08:19,948
- Hello?

1201
01:08:19,948 --> 01:08:20,809
- [Brenda] Full Service Limo--

1202
01:08:20,809 --> 01:08:23,050
- I've been expecting your call!

1203
01:08:23,050 --> 01:08:25,015
- [Brenda] Full Service Limo?

1204
01:08:25,015 --> 01:08:26,604
- Shh, shh, shh!

1205
01:08:26,604 --> 01:08:27,437
It's him!

1206
01:08:27,437 --> 01:08:28,270
Al!

1207
01:08:29,520 --> 01:08:30,849
- Chandra!

1208
01:08:30,849 --> 01:08:32,104
It's Al Pacino!

1209
01:08:32,104 --> 01:08:33,175
- [Brenda] My friend gave me your card.

1210
01:08:33,175 --> 01:08:34,017
- Yes, yes!

1211
01:08:34,017 --> 01:08:36,260
It is wonderful to hear your voice.

1212
01:08:36,260 --> 01:08:37,510
Oh boy, oh yes.

1213
01:08:38,512 --> 01:08:40,033
How have you been, Al?

1214
01:08:40,033 --> 01:08:41,616
- Is this 555-0162?

1215
01:08:42,542 --> 01:08:43,727
- That is correct, Al.

1216
01:08:43,727 --> 01:08:46,682
I'm anxious to hear all
about your proposition.

1217
01:08:46,682 --> 01:08:47,660
- Oh, well.

1218
01:08:47,660 --> 01:08:49,556
It's a gold Cadillac,

1219
01:08:49,556 --> 01:08:51,806
1970, extremely good shape,

1220
01:08:53,419 --> 01:08:55,167
low mileage.

1221
01:08:55,167 --> 01:08:56,374
- It sounds terrific!

1222
01:08:56,374 --> 01:08:57,671
When may I see it?

1223
01:08:57,671 --> 01:08:58,871
Tonight?

1224
01:08:58,871 --> 01:08:59,988
Perfect.

1225
01:08:59,988 --> 01:09:01,155
Thank you, Al.

1226
01:09:05,153 --> 01:09:07,720
He has a script, he wants me to read it.

1227
01:09:07,720 --> 01:09:09,024
It sounds very interesting.

1228
01:09:09,024 --> 01:09:10,384
- A script!

1229
01:09:10,384 --> 01:09:12,426
I'm so excited for you.

1230
01:09:12,426 --> 01:09:13,259
- Damn.

1231
01:09:16,813 --> 01:09:17,646
- Please.

1232
01:09:17,646 --> 01:09:19,203
I think I must get ...

1233
01:09:19,203 --> 01:09:20,370
- I'll get it.

1234
01:09:21,982 --> 01:09:25,969
(footsteps running away)

1235
01:09:25,969 --> 01:09:27,302
- My example ...

1236
01:09:28,695 --> 01:09:29,528
I'm sorry if I--

1237
01:09:29,528 --> 01:09:30,361
- Don't.

1238
01:09:32,059 --> 01:09:32,892
Don't.

1239
01:09:36,183 --> 01:09:37,477
- [Bipin] Quick Chandra!

1240
01:09:37,477 --> 01:09:40,705
We don't want Mr. Al Pacino to wait!

1241
01:09:40,705 --> 01:09:43,065
(footsteps running away)

1242
01:09:43,065 --> 01:09:44,852
- [Chandra] Unbelievable!

1243
01:09:44,852 --> 01:09:48,141
- [Bipin] Al Pacino, Mr.
Al Pacino rang this house!

1244
01:09:48,141 --> 01:09:50,724
(mellow music)

1245
01:09:56,381 --> 01:09:58,100
- I know what you done.

1246
01:09:58,100 --> 01:09:59,100
- What I do?

1247
01:10:13,402 --> 01:10:14,787
Alright.

1248
01:10:14,787 --> 01:10:17,162
I'll sell the car if that's what you want.

1249
01:10:17,162 --> 01:10:19,284
- I want an air conditioner.

1250
01:10:19,284 --> 01:10:21,643
I want my granny's china back.

1251
01:10:21,643 --> 01:10:24,156
I want to go out to a dinner
and a movie occasionally.

1252
01:10:24,156 --> 01:10:26,989
I want to trust the man I married.

1253
01:10:45,939 --> 01:10:49,494
(bike bell ringing)

1254
01:10:49,494 --> 01:10:51,911
- Errol, what time you going?

1255
01:10:53,115 --> 01:10:54,375
Errol?

1256
01:10:54,375 --> 01:10:55,792
What, we driving?

1257
01:10:57,311 --> 01:10:59,321
- [Bipin] Chandra, where's my keys?

1258
01:10:59,321 --> 01:11:02,723
I have 10 minutes to catch the ferry.

1259
01:11:02,723 --> 01:11:05,640
(melancholy music)

1260
01:11:30,342 --> 01:11:33,092
- [Ramon] Come on, Joe, let's go.

1261
01:11:42,399 --> 01:11:43,644
- Ugh!

1262
01:11:43,644 --> 01:11:45,413
I can't wear nothing nice in this place.

1263
01:11:45,413 --> 01:11:47,089
- It was stuck pretty good.

1264
01:11:47,089 --> 01:11:48,837
- Jesus, look out, look out.

1265
01:11:48,837 --> 01:11:49,941
Here, hold this.

1266
01:11:49,941 --> 01:11:51,524
I'll be right back.

1267
01:12:05,209 --> 01:12:07,126
Come on, man, let's go.

1268
01:12:08,324 --> 01:12:10,907
(mellow music)

1269
01:12:27,092 --> 01:12:30,385
- [Voiceover] Ah, man he took it!

1270
01:12:30,385 --> 01:12:32,802
(chattering)

1271
01:12:44,838 --> 01:12:47,005
(screams)

1272
01:13:05,755 --> 01:13:06,588
- Hello?

1273
01:13:06,588 --> 01:13:09,348
Yes, can I order an
iced cappuccino, please?

1274
01:13:09,348 --> 01:13:10,371
With sugar, yes.

1275
01:13:10,371 --> 01:13:12,022
No, no, no, no, no, with no sugar.

1276
01:13:12,022 --> 01:13:15,158
Actually, um, yeah, with sugar.

1277
01:13:15,158 --> 01:13:17,496
Oh, fuck it, you decide.

1278
01:13:17,496 --> 01:13:18,798
Hmm, yes.

1279
01:13:18,798 --> 01:13:20,749
Can I pay by check?

1280
01:13:20,749 --> 01:13:22,883
It's Sylvie, right next door.

1281
01:13:22,883 --> 01:13:24,042
You know that ...

1282
01:13:24,042 --> 01:13:25,107
Oh, come on.

1283
01:13:25,107 --> 01:13:26,322
Can I speak with Carlo?

1284
01:13:26,322 --> 01:13:28,263
He always accepts my checks.

1285
01:13:28,263 --> 01:13:29,096
Okay.

1286
01:13:31,461 --> 01:13:32,951
Carlo?

1287
01:13:32,951 --> 01:13:35,362
Si, ciao, it's Sylvie, hey baby.

1288
01:13:35,362 --> 01:13:36,986
Yes, it's just about, yes.

1289
01:13:36,986 --> 01:13:38,350
Just this time.

1290
01:13:38,350 --> 01:13:40,255
Come on, yes, I promise.

1291
01:13:40,255 --> 01:13:41,104
Yes.

1292
01:13:41,104 --> 01:13:41,937
Okay.

1293
01:13:41,937 --> 01:13:43,510
Thank you.

1294
01:13:43,510 --> 01:13:45,820
(phone beeps)

1295
01:13:45,820 --> 01:13:49,987
(kids chattering)
(city drones)

1296
01:13:55,899 --> 01:13:56,732
- What?

1297
01:13:56,732 --> 01:13:58,016
- Where's Mrs. Pacshesku' chop?

1298
01:13:58,016 --> 01:14:00,828
- No, forget it, I got the money.

1299
01:14:00,828 --> 01:14:01,661
- I'll meet you there.

1300
01:14:01,661 --> 01:14:02,933
- I got the money, man.

1301
01:14:02,933 --> 01:14:04,600
Forget the old lady.

1302
01:14:05,778 --> 01:14:06,736
(car honks)

1303
01:14:06,736 --> 01:14:08,212
Hurry up!

1304
01:14:08,212 --> 01:14:10,795
(mellow music)

1305
01:14:29,020 --> 01:14:30,359
- [Voiceover] God, I can't believe it.

1306
01:14:30,359 --> 01:14:33,124
In all my years, a 15 inning marathon,

1307
01:14:33,124 --> 01:14:35,164
full of some of the most bizarre twists.

1308
01:14:35,164 --> 01:14:36,283
If you're just tuning in,

1309
01:14:36,283 --> 01:14:38,892
well, it's been a long time
since we've been able to say it.

1310
01:14:38,892 --> 01:14:41,515
Today's been nothing short of a miracle

1311
01:14:41,515 --> 01:14:42,776
by the New York Mets.

1312
01:14:42,776 --> 01:14:45,109
(screaming)

1313
01:14:49,721 --> 01:14:50,554
Yes, yes!

1314
01:14:59,972 --> 01:15:02,055
(thumps)

1315
01:15:04,721 --> 01:15:07,304
(door rattles)

1316
01:15:11,386 --> 01:15:12,469
Albani!

1317
01:15:12,469 --> 01:15:14,719
(thumping)

1318
01:15:18,063 --> 01:15:18,896
Albani!

1319
01:15:31,094 --> 01:15:31,927
Oh my god.

1320
01:15:37,499 --> 01:15:40,582
(tugboat horn blows)

1321
01:15:46,743 --> 01:15:49,910
(ferry engine drones)

1322
01:15:54,066 --> 01:15:56,983
(melancholy music)

1323
01:16:23,294 --> 01:16:24,580
- [Ramon] Where's the truck?

1324
01:16:24,580 --> 01:16:25,413
- Where's the money?

1325
01:16:25,413 --> 01:16:26,401
- Where's the truck?

1326
01:16:26,401 --> 01:16:27,234
- Where's the money?

1327
01:16:27,234 --> 01:16:28,281
- Man, we should wait for Josif.

1328
01:16:28,281 --> 01:16:30,265
I don't know about this.

1329
01:16:30,265 --> 01:16:31,501
Ow.

1330
01:16:31,501 --> 01:16:32,334
Why'd you do that?

1331
01:16:32,334 --> 01:16:35,341
(speaking in foreign language)
(groaning)

1332
01:16:35,341 --> 01:16:36,424
Come on, man.

1333
01:16:39,559 --> 01:16:40,588
- What the fuck?

1334
01:16:40,588 --> 01:16:43,737
- [Ramon] Mrs. Petrescu's chop!

1335
01:16:43,737 --> 01:16:46,987
(elevated train roars)

1336
01:16:55,113 --> 01:16:55,946
Oh, shit.

1337
01:16:59,374 --> 01:17:02,541
(police siren echoes)

1338
01:17:04,926 --> 01:17:05,759
No!

1339
01:17:06,898 --> 01:17:07,731
No, don't!

1340
01:17:10,360 --> 01:17:11,193
Joe!

1341
01:17:12,555 --> 01:17:16,472
(speaking in foreign language)

1342
01:17:24,984 --> 01:17:26,348
- [Voiceover] Air conditioning
working in this studio?

1343
01:17:26,348 --> 01:17:27,184
- [Voiceover] Call maintenance.

1344
01:17:27,184 --> 01:17:28,326
- [Voiceover] Hot weather
has a lot of people

1345
01:17:28,326 --> 01:17:29,411
hot under the collar.

1346
01:17:29,411 --> 01:17:30,888
Details on last night's ugly bar fight

1347
01:17:30,888 --> 01:17:32,359
on Staten Island in just a moment.

1348
01:17:32,359 --> 01:17:33,192
- [Voiceover] Right now, hazy--

1349
01:17:33,192 --> 01:17:34,025
(car honking)

1350
01:17:34,025 --> 01:17:35,479
- You wanna fight?

1351
01:17:35,479 --> 01:17:37,594
What you drivin' 20 miles an hour for?

1352
01:17:37,594 --> 01:17:38,773
Won't you get on the shoulder?

1353
01:17:38,773 --> 01:17:39,606
- Don't start.

1354
01:17:39,606 --> 01:17:40,439
- Your drawers are showing.

1355
01:17:40,439 --> 01:17:41,272
- Don't start.

1356
01:17:41,272 --> 01:17:42,105
- You're stupid.

1357
01:17:42,105 --> 01:17:42,938
- Don't start!

1358
01:17:42,938 --> 01:17:44,573
I'll leave you out on the corner

1359
01:17:44,573 --> 01:17:47,323
with your backside on the subway.

1360
01:17:49,595 --> 01:17:51,952
- Call me when you get settled.

1361
01:17:51,952 --> 01:17:53,003
- Of course.

1362
01:17:53,003 --> 01:17:55,888
- I'll bring your things over later.

1363
01:17:55,888 --> 01:17:58,305
- [Vikram] You don't have to.

1364
01:18:00,280 --> 01:18:01,749
- Let me know when you start working.

1365
01:18:01,749 --> 01:18:03,510
I'll come by the set.

1366
01:18:03,510 --> 01:18:04,676
- Of course.

1367
01:18:04,676 --> 01:18:06,610
Bring Chandra and the kids too.

1368
01:18:06,610 --> 01:18:08,138
(horns honking)

1369
01:18:08,138 --> 01:18:09,500
- I'm blocking traffic.

1370
01:18:09,500 --> 01:18:10,500
I better go.

1371
01:18:23,541 --> 01:18:26,458
(melancholy music)

1372
01:19:25,797 --> 01:19:27,797
(moans)

1373
01:19:34,168 --> 01:19:36,501
(muttering)

1374
01:19:38,891 --> 01:19:40,224
- Mother fucker!

1375
01:19:44,854 --> 01:19:46,234
- [Voiceover] For the time
being, what we have to worry

1376
01:19:46,234 --> 01:19:48,579
about after this day of
record-breaking heat,

1377
01:19:48,579 --> 01:19:50,337
are the thunderstorms
which are approaching.

1378
01:19:50,337 --> 01:19:52,271
The National Weather Service
has put out a severe--

1379
01:19:52,271 --> 01:19:54,771
(phone rings)

1380
01:19:58,486 --> 01:20:01,054
These thunderstorms could
bring drenching rainfall,

1381
01:20:01,054 --> 01:20:04,126
deadly cloud-to-ground
lightning, as well as--

1382
01:20:04,126 --> 01:20:07,043
(music box jingle)

1383
01:20:14,240 --> 01:20:15,341
- Take this off.

1384
01:20:15,341 --> 01:20:16,847
- No, no, no, no, don't touch that.

1385
01:20:16,847 --> 01:20:19,102
- Oh no, you messin' with Los Santos?

1386
01:20:19,102 --> 01:20:20,019
- Yeah, so?

1387
01:20:21,347 --> 01:20:24,749
- Oh no, don't look but there goes

1388
01:20:24,749 --> 01:20:27,473
last year's Miss Colita.

1389
01:20:27,473 --> 01:20:28,931
- Where?

1390
01:20:28,931 --> 01:20:30,234
- Oh, that's Martha?

1391
01:20:30,234 --> 01:20:32,638
Somebody told me she was married in Miami.

1392
01:20:32,638 --> 01:20:34,660
- [Voiceover] They lied.

1393
01:20:34,660 --> 01:20:38,562
(speaking in foreign language)
(laughs)

1394
01:20:38,562 --> 01:20:42,729
Junior, por que you don't
find me sexy no more, huh?

1395
01:20:44,237 --> 01:20:46,674
- Shit, you know what
happened to Junior's father?

1396
01:20:46,674 --> 01:20:49,845
He got fucked with big time, big time!

1397
01:20:49,845 --> 01:20:54,012
- No, (speaking in foreign language)

1398
01:21:02,477 --> 01:21:05,310
(doorbell buzzes)

1399
01:21:06,193 --> 01:21:10,110
(speaking in foreign language)

1400
01:21:15,779 --> 01:21:17,155
What do you want?

1401
01:21:17,155 --> 01:21:18,949
- Mio Mundo Design?

1402
01:21:18,949 --> 01:21:20,860
- I can't hear you, who are you?

1403
01:21:20,860 --> 01:21:22,386
- [Ramon] Mio Mundo?

1404
01:21:22,386 --> 01:21:23,917
- Yes, that's me.

1405
01:21:23,917 --> 01:21:25,144
It's closed.

1406
01:21:25,144 --> 01:21:26,536
- Please, I gotta pick it up tonight.

1407
01:21:26,536 --> 01:21:28,763
It's just a dress for Hidalgo.

1408
01:21:28,763 --> 01:21:29,709
- Hidalgo?

1409
01:21:29,709 --> 01:21:31,712
You were supposed to come last week!

1410
01:21:31,712 --> 01:21:34,324
You really fucked me up, come in.

1411
01:21:34,324 --> 01:21:35,157
Voila.

1412
01:21:36,882 --> 01:21:37,965
- This is it?

1413
01:21:38,941 --> 01:21:41,085
- Beautiful, huh?

1414
01:21:41,085 --> 01:21:43,978
This silk, flowers,
they're very, very dear.

1415
01:21:43,978 --> 01:21:46,540
They're silk. (sighs)

1416
01:21:46,540 --> 01:21:47,373
And,

1417
01:21:49,627 --> 01:21:52,544
how are you planning to pay for it?

1418
01:21:55,054 --> 01:21:56,664
- Here's $20.

1419
01:21:56,664 --> 01:21:58,642
Will you take that as a down payment?

1420
01:21:58,642 --> 01:22:00,861
And I'll pay you the rest tomorrow?

1421
01:22:00,861 --> 01:22:01,879
- Is this a joke?

1422
01:22:01,879 --> 01:22:03,049
Are you joking with me?

1423
01:22:03,049 --> 01:22:04,538
That's all I got.

1424
01:22:04,538 --> 01:22:05,959
And my driver's license.

1425
01:22:05,959 --> 01:22:07,331
You can hold it, if you want,

1426
01:22:07,331 --> 01:22:09,139
until I can scrape together
the rest of the money.

1427
01:22:09,139 --> 01:22:11,216
Please, I'm begging you.

1428
01:22:11,216 --> 01:22:12,933
- This is a $1000 dollar dress!

1429
01:22:12,933 --> 01:22:15,049
- A $1000 dollars?

1430
01:22:15,049 --> 01:22:17,079
Maybe you can pull off some
of those expensive flowers.

1431
01:22:17,079 --> 01:22:18,534
How much would that save me?

1432
01:22:18,534 --> 01:22:19,884
- Look, absolutely not!

1433
01:22:19,884 --> 01:22:21,730
- Come on, I just wanted ...

1434
01:22:21,730 --> 01:22:23,214
Work with me, baby!

1435
01:22:23,214 --> 01:22:25,497
- Work with you my ass.

1436
01:22:25,497 --> 01:22:29,414
(speaking in foreign language)

1437
01:22:32,137 --> 01:22:35,137
I'm having a very bad day, for real.

1438
01:22:38,808 --> 01:22:39,641
- How bad?

1439
01:22:41,559 --> 01:22:42,392
Ugh!

1440
01:22:42,392 --> 01:22:43,225
- Bad.

1441
01:22:44,101 --> 01:22:44,934
- Bad.

1442
01:22:46,636 --> 01:22:47,469
Smoke?

1443
01:22:56,152 --> 01:22:56,985
- Thanks.

1444
01:23:01,470 --> 01:23:02,560
- Do you want a piece of ice,

1445
01:23:02,560 --> 01:23:04,339
for your face?

1446
01:23:04,339 --> 01:23:05,922
- Nah, I'm alright.

1447
01:23:11,225 --> 01:23:13,225
(sighs)

1448
01:23:15,092 --> 01:23:18,842
- You know, the fucking
material is imported.

1449
01:23:19,776 --> 01:23:21,840
Ah, it's hand-dyed.

1450
01:23:21,840 --> 01:23:25,423
It took me two times
to achieve that color.

1451
01:23:27,591 --> 01:23:29,413
It's fabulous color, don't you think?

1452
01:23:29,413 --> 01:23:30,617
- Do you like pork?

1453
01:23:30,617 --> 01:23:31,450
- Huh?

1454
01:23:31,450 --> 01:23:32,854
- Bacon, sausage, chops.

1455
01:23:32,854 --> 01:23:33,799
I'll pay you in pork,

1456
01:23:33,799 --> 01:23:36,416
all the pork you can eat for a year.

1457
01:23:36,416 --> 01:23:37,615
- Are you making fun of me?

1458
01:23:37,615 --> 01:23:38,448
- No.

1459
01:23:38,448 --> 01:23:40,011
It's, it's, it's ...

1460
01:23:40,011 --> 01:23:40,844
nice.

1461
01:23:41,896 --> 01:23:43,421
Really.

1462
01:23:43,421 --> 01:23:44,944
- Really?

1463
01:23:44,944 --> 01:23:47,027
(scoffs)

1464
01:23:53,378 --> 01:23:54,878
- I tell you what.

1465
01:23:56,828 --> 01:24:00,173
You give me those $20
dollars and the subway token.

1466
01:24:00,173 --> 01:24:01,756
- I need the token.

1467
01:24:02,677 --> 01:24:05,092
- Alright, then I'll hang onto the dress,

1468
01:24:05,092 --> 01:24:06,606
until you bring me the rest of the money,

1469
01:24:06,606 --> 01:24:08,439
and I need it tonight.

1470
01:24:09,608 --> 01:24:11,108
I'll make it $500.

1471
01:24:15,970 --> 01:24:17,829
(phone rings)

1472
01:24:17,829 --> 01:24:18,662

1474
01:24:21,463 --> 01:24:22,345

and he went to went to Atlantic City.

1476
01:24:23,863 --> 01:24:25,008
- Atlantic City?

1477
01:24:25,008 --> 01:24:26,033
You think?

1478
01:24:26,033 --> 01:24:27,550
That fuck!

1479
01:24:27,550 --> 01:24:28,978
Excuse me, um ...

1480
01:24:28,978 --> 01:24:30,779
When he gets home, tell
him I need to speak to him.

1481
01:24:30,779 --> 01:24:31,637
Alright?

1482
01:24:31,637 --> 01:24:34,220
- He doesn't have home anymore.

1483
01:24:38,756 --> 01:24:40,155
- Yes, officer.

1484
01:24:40,155 --> 01:24:42,822
It was stolen from my driveway.

1485
01:24:42,822 --> 01:24:44,413
Yes.

1486
01:24:44,413 --> 01:24:46,978
See, he's a scrawny man.

1487
01:24:46,978 --> 01:24:47,811
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

1488
01:24:47,811 --> 01:24:48,728
Beady eyes.

1489
01:24:49,752 --> 01:24:52,608
And there be two others,
three other with him.

1490
01:24:52,608 --> 01:24:55,191
(mellow music)

1491
01:25:06,457 --> 01:25:08,859
- I want a suite with a view.

1492
01:25:08,859 --> 01:25:10,751
- Do you have a reservation, sir?

1493
01:25:10,751 --> 01:25:12,283
- No.

1494
01:25:12,283 --> 01:25:13,116
- Well, you're in luck.

1495
01:25:13,116 --> 01:25:14,681
We just had a cancellation.

1496
01:25:14,681 --> 01:25:15,765
How would you like to pay for this?

1497
01:25:15,765 --> 01:25:16,932
- Credit card.

1498
01:25:18,213 --> 01:25:20,630
I hope the suite is very big,

1499
01:25:21,965 --> 01:25:24,465
and the finest suite you have.

1500
01:25:26,615 --> 01:25:28,365
- Thank you, Mr. Raj.

1501
01:25:29,370 --> 01:25:31,345
- You have recognized me?

1502
01:25:31,345 --> 01:25:33,764
- Oh, I'm sorry, sir,
your name is on the card.

1503
01:25:33,764 --> 01:25:34,597
- Oh.

1504
01:25:36,753 --> 01:25:38,414
- I'll come out to the Bronx.

1505
01:25:38,414 --> 01:25:39,332
Don't go out.

1506
01:25:39,332 --> 01:25:41,577
Stay there 'til I get there, alright?

1507
01:25:41,577 --> 01:25:43,194
Promise.

01:25:43,194 --> 01:25:44,027

1518
01:26:22,680 --> 01:26:25,461
I don't have any small change.

1519
01:26:25,461 --> 01:26:26,294
Sorry.

1520
01:26:29,280 --> 01:26:30,447
Oh, wait here.

1529
01:26:48,919 --> 01:26:51,669

1530
01:26:56,285 --> 01:26:58,194

What we do?

1539

- Look, you're lucky.

1540
01:27:11,968 --> 01:27:13,557
Everything's in order.

1541
01:27:13,557 --> 01:27:15,854
Turn the music down and keep it above 20.

1542
01:27:15,854 --> 01:27:17,272
You were drivin' too slow.

1543
01:27:17,272 --> 01:27:18,123
Have a nice day.

1544
01:27:18,123 --> 01:27:18,956
- That's it?

1545
01:27:18,956 --> 01:27:19,919
No apology?

1546
01:27:19,919 --> 01:27:21,404

1547
01:27:21,404 --> 01:27:23,666
- No, I want an apology.

1548
01:27:23,666 --> 01:27:24,532
- Let it go, man.

1549
01:27:24,532 --> 01:27:25,721
You're getting our mood down.

1550
01:27:25,721 --> 01:27:27,927
- Stop me and don't give me an apology.

1551
01:27:27,927 --> 01:27:29,300
Hold me now, hold me.

1552

1554
01:27:32,339 --> 01:27:34,241

Uh, duck comfit, yeah,

Good, good.

The souffle?

1576
01:28:18,369 --> 01:28:20,119
Good idea, very good.

I couldn't find the restaurant.

1586
01:28:48,152 --> 01:28:49,314
Very nervous there.

1587
01:28:49,314 --> 01:28:51,143
I go to every one in city.

1588
01:28:51,143 --> 01:28:54,192
I'm so tired of having to say nice things.

1589
01:28:54,192 --> 01:28:56,226
Very nice colors, very nice lines.

1590
01:28:56,226 --> 01:28:57,656
Like, like, like.

1591
01:28:57,656 --> 01:28:59,444
No talk of fashion please.

1592
01:28:59,444 --> 01:29:00,756
Just only fun.

1599
01:29:39,009 --> 01:29:41,126

Come here, ch.

1607
01:30:10,903 --> 01:30:12,986
(coughs)

1608
01:30:16,407 --> 01:30:17,607
Bastard!

1609
01:30:17,607 --> 01:30:19,433
(doorbell rings)

1610
01:30:19,433 --> 01:30:21,016
- Hold on a minute.

1611
01:30:26,320 --> 01:30:27,487
Ah, excellent!

1612
01:30:28,721 --> 01:30:30,304
Please bring it in.

1613
01:30:31,629 --> 01:30:32,462
Good.

1614
01:30:33,515 --> 01:30:34,348
Good.

1615
01:30:35,453 --> 01:30:36,286
Good.

1616
01:30:38,826 --> 01:30:39,659
Good.

1617
01:30:48,376 --> 01:30:49,756
(door slams)

1618
01:30:49,756 --> 01:30:51,351
- Wanna beer?

1619
01:30:51,351 --> 01:30:53,647
- Can you get the money?

1620
01:30:53,647 --> 01:30:55,800
- Not this week, compa.

1621
01:30:55,800 --> 01:30:56,633
Rent.

1622
01:31:00,192 --> 01:31:03,227
Took my lady out a couple of times.

1623
01:31:03,227 --> 01:31:04,539
Gotta do it, man.

1624
01:31:04,539 --> 01:31:05,424
It ain't like it used to be,

1625
01:31:05,424 --> 01:31:06,807
when all you had to do
was tell a lady she's fine

1626
01:31:06,807 --> 01:31:08,557
and get that coochie.

1627
01:31:15,191 --> 01:31:16,024
Look it.

1628
01:31:17,696 --> 01:31:20,786
Don't tell me you're strung out.

1629
01:31:20,786 --> 01:31:22,068
What?

1630
01:31:22,068 --> 01:31:23,905
- I promised Marisol I'd buy this dress

1631
01:31:23,905 --> 01:31:25,352
for the Miss Colita pageant.

1632
01:31:25,352 --> 01:31:27,290
What's I gonna say when
when she asked me, no?

1633
01:31:27,290 --> 01:31:29,236
She thinks I'm some loaded, married,

1634
01:31:29,236 --> 01:31:32,037
fat cat riding a cash pony.

1635
01:31:32,037 --> 01:31:32,870
Married?

1636
01:31:34,050 --> 01:31:34,939
I had say something.

1637
01:31:34,939 --> 01:31:36,469
How do I look I ain't
got a crib of my own?

1638
01:31:36,469 --> 01:31:37,801
- Get your own place then, man.

1639
01:31:37,801 --> 01:31:39,349
- Working at Ridgewood Pork Store?

1640
01:31:39,349 --> 01:31:40,182
Fuck!

1641
01:31:41,282 --> 01:31:43,450
- That's some sick shit, compa.

1642
01:31:43,450 --> 01:31:45,233
You better find yourself some church.

1643
01:31:45,233 --> 01:31:46,179
- Fuck you!

1644
01:31:46,179 --> 01:31:47,705
When's the last time you went to church?

1645
01:31:47,705 --> 01:31:48,803
- Last Sunday, baby.

1646
01:31:48,803 --> 01:31:51,257
I was on my knees, full of
the holy spirit and shit.

1647
01:31:51,257 --> 01:31:53,257
- I don't wanna hear it.

1648
01:31:56,369 --> 01:32:00,286
(speaking in foreign language)

1649
01:32:02,696 --> 01:32:03,613
- Oh, shit.

1650
01:32:05,807 --> 01:32:06,829
Is it good?

1651
01:32:06,829 --> 01:32:07,745
- Good?

1652
01:32:07,745 --> 01:32:09,640
It's unbelievable, man.

1653
01:32:09,640 --> 01:32:13,290
She puts off fresh garlic, green peppers,

1654
01:32:13,290 --> 01:32:16,155
she sprinkle some of that cilantro on it.

1655
01:32:16,155 --> 01:32:20,072
(speaking in foreign language)

1656
01:32:22,514 --> 01:32:24,014
- $500 dollars ...

1657
01:32:25,626 --> 01:32:27,213
That's a lot of money, bro.

1658
01:32:27,213 --> 01:32:29,781
- It's a designer's dress from Soho.

1659
01:32:29,781 --> 01:32:30,781
Ugly as sin.

1660
01:32:32,279 --> 01:32:33,594
- Has she seen it?

1661
01:32:33,594 --> 01:32:34,534
- [Ramon] No.

1662
01:32:34,534 --> 01:32:35,662
- Oh,

1663
01:32:35,662 --> 01:32:37,193
then we ain't got no problem, bro.

1664
01:32:37,193 --> 01:32:38,908
I'm gonna hook you up.

1665
01:32:38,908 --> 01:32:41,692
Yo, there's a warehouse,
not too far from here.

1666
01:32:41,692 --> 01:32:43,205
Designers clothes, bro.

1667
01:32:43,205 --> 01:32:46,512
I got myself a pair of
Perry Ellis slacks slammin'.

1668
01:32:46,512 --> 01:32:48,011
All we gotta do is get the night watchman

1669
01:32:48,011 --> 01:32:49,691
a bottle of Bacardi, and boom,

1670
01:32:49,691 --> 01:32:51,789
You get your girl a
beautiful designer dress.

1671
01:32:51,789 --> 01:32:53,243
- You mean steal?

1672
01:32:53,243 --> 01:32:55,826
(upbeat music)

1673
01:33:12,576 --> 01:33:15,417
- My boyfriend, he's an asshole.

1674
01:33:15,417 --> 01:33:18,141
He really is an asshole.

1675
01:33:18,141 --> 01:33:20,265
- Oh, I'm sorry.

1676
01:33:20,265 --> 01:33:22,035
(laughs)

1677
01:33:22,035 --> 01:33:24,123
- It's my fault for having such

1678
01:33:24,123 --> 01:33:26,736
poor judgement in every aspect of my life.

1679
01:33:26,736 --> 01:33:29,715
You know, to quote my mother.

1680
01:33:29,715 --> 01:33:33,586
- I'd like very much to meet your mother.

1681
01:33:33,586 --> 01:33:35,587
Very great creator.

1682
01:33:35,587 --> 01:33:36,686
- Mmm.

1683
01:33:36,686 --> 01:33:39,249
- She lives in Vienna, yes?

1684
01:33:39,249 --> 01:33:40,138
- Yeah, she lives in

1685
01:33:40,138 --> 01:33:44,404
(speaking in foreign language)

1686
01:33:44,404 --> 01:33:45,647
many ways of the world.

1687
01:33:45,647 --> 01:33:46,586
I don't wanna talk about her.

1688
01:33:46,586 --> 01:33:48,003
I don't, I don't.

1689
01:33:49,367 --> 01:33:50,610
I don't like it when people look at me

1690
01:33:50,610 --> 01:33:52,059
when I say my name.

1691
01:33:52,059 --> 01:33:54,033
(laughs)

1692
01:33:54,033 --> 01:33:54,907
- Sorry,

1693
01:33:54,907 --> 01:33:56,260
I understand.

1694
01:33:56,260 --> 01:33:57,093
- Do you?

1695
01:33:59,851 --> 01:34:01,505
Okay, let's ...

1696
01:34:01,505 --> 01:34:02,338
Let's finish it.

1697
01:34:02,338 --> 01:34:03,354
Come on.

1698
01:34:03,354 --> 01:34:06,424
- Oh girl, so good,
you're looking wa-seen!

1699
01:34:06,424 --> 01:34:07,526
Don't be nervous.

1700
01:34:07,526 --> 01:34:08,602
- Is it too much?

1701
01:34:08,602 --> 01:34:11,023
- No, no, you Queen of Sheba,

1702
01:34:11,023 --> 01:34:13,189
and I Cleopatra myself, eh?

1703
01:34:13,189 --> 01:34:14,022
Ha ha!

1704
01:34:14,022 --> 01:34:16,346
You won't even think about
Errol and he nonsense.

1705
01:34:16,346 --> 01:34:17,179
- Errol who?

1706
01:34:17,179 --> 01:34:18,012
- Stupid.

1707
01:34:18,012 --> 01:34:21,421
- Maggie, I no longer have a husband.

1708
01:34:21,421 --> 01:34:24,338
- To the end of misery and couture!

1709
01:34:25,606 --> 01:34:27,939
- To relaxation, and to you.

1710
01:34:29,254 --> 01:34:30,837
- War without pain.

1711
01:34:32,233 --> 01:34:34,683
- Is everything alright here?

1712
01:34:34,683 --> 01:34:36,570
I'll leave this here when you're done.

1713
01:34:36,570 --> 01:34:38,903
Thank you very much, mm-hmm.

1714
01:34:48,835 --> 01:34:49,752
- I too ...

1715
01:34:51,527 --> 01:34:52,648
Nature calls.

1716
01:34:52,648 --> 01:34:54,775
I'll be right back.

1717
01:34:54,775 --> 01:34:57,355
(upbeat music)

1718
01:34:57,355 --> 01:34:58,688
- Hold on, baby.

1719
01:35:02,179 --> 01:35:03,687
Hey, you got Bacardi, right?

1720
01:35:03,687 --> 01:35:05,542
- Don Rico, three dollars cheaper.

1721
01:35:05,542 --> 01:35:06,665
What's the difference?

1722
01:35:06,665 --> 01:35:09,520
- One, it says Don Rico and
it doesn't says Bacardi.

1723
01:35:09,520 --> 01:35:10,863
- What are you doin', man?

1724
01:35:10,863 --> 01:35:12,280
- Takin' it back!

1725
01:35:23,760 --> 01:35:24,943
- You know what?

1726
01:35:24,943 --> 01:35:26,282
Let's get outta here.

1727
01:35:26,282 --> 01:35:27,147
And I'll meet you outside,

1728
01:35:27,147 --> 01:35:28,463
because I see a friend at the bar.

1729
01:35:28,463 --> 01:35:30,617
I'm gonna go and say hello.

1730
01:35:30,617 --> 01:35:31,988
- I will wait for you.

1731
01:35:31,988 --> 01:35:32,821
- No, no, no.

1732
01:35:32,821 --> 01:35:34,654
I'll be just a second.

1733
01:35:35,795 --> 01:35:36,883
Really.

1734
01:35:36,883 --> 01:35:37,716
- Okay.

1735
01:35:38,586 --> 01:35:41,919
(background chattering)

1736
01:36:11,988 --> 01:36:14,259
(plate rattles)

1737
01:36:14,259 --> 01:36:18,646
- [Voiceover] Hey, lady,
you can't go through here.

1738
01:36:18,646 --> 01:36:19,479
- Yuki?

1739
01:36:20,771 --> 01:36:22,270
Yuki.

1740
01:36:22,270 --> 01:36:23,738
Yuki!

1741
01:36:23,738 --> 01:36:24,571
Come.

1742
01:36:27,207 --> 01:36:28,547
- [Yuki] I didn't see you.

1743
01:36:28,547 --> 01:36:30,097
- No, no, I came out of the side door.

1744
01:36:30,097 --> 01:36:31,347
Let's go, taxi!

1745
01:36:33,996 --> 01:36:34,829
- Hey!

1746
01:36:36,022 --> 01:36:36,973
(speaking in foreign language)

1747
01:36:36,973 --> 01:36:38,483
- Hey, hey!

1748
01:36:38,483 --> 01:36:40,066
- How are you dude?

1749
01:36:41,032 --> 01:36:43,901
- This fucking heat is killing me.

1750
01:36:43,901 --> 01:36:45,685
- Yeah, it's a bitch, bro.

1751
01:36:45,685 --> 01:36:48,203
- Checkin' in, 'cause I'm off the books.

1752
01:36:48,203 --> 01:36:50,203
It ain't with it, is he?

1753
01:36:51,047 --> 01:36:52,667
- Hey man, I was just in the neighborhood,

1754
01:36:52,667 --> 01:36:54,545
figured I'd drop by and say,

1755
01:36:54,545 --> 01:36:55,378
hello!

1756
01:36:55,378 --> 01:36:56,828
(laughing)

1757
01:36:56,828 --> 01:36:58,363
- I've given up, man.

1758
01:36:58,363 --> 01:37:00,510
Shit, I thought you knew.

1759
01:37:00,510 --> 01:37:02,279
I'm in recovery.

1760
01:37:02,279 --> 01:37:03,779
I'm sober, hombre.

1761
01:37:04,879 --> 01:37:06,218
- What?

1762
01:37:06,218 --> 01:37:07,347
- Just jokin'.

1763
01:37:07,347 --> 01:37:09,475
- Oh, man, you had me goin', dude!

1764
01:37:09,475 --> 01:37:10,975
- I had you goin'!

1765
01:37:14,280 --> 01:37:15,907
- Bacardi!

1766
01:37:15,907 --> 01:37:17,389
- Yeah. (laughing)

1767
01:37:17,389 --> 01:37:18,222
- Ha ha!

1768
01:37:19,310 --> 01:37:20,143
- Whoo!

1769
01:37:22,596 --> 01:37:25,846
- Fuckin' thing is pushin' in my liver,

1770
01:37:27,077 --> 01:37:29,077
but I'm dyin' to use it.

1771
01:37:31,141 --> 01:37:32,202
- Come on, man.

1772
01:37:32,202 --> 01:37:33,035
- Yeah!

1773
01:37:33,035 --> 01:37:33,868
(laughing)

1774
01:37:33,868 --> 01:37:34,701

1782
01:37:47,116 --> 01:37:50,760
- [Voiceover] Errol, come
on, Errol, come on now.

1783
01:37:50,760 --> 01:37:52,295
- [Errol] This is called
a backsplash here.

01:37:52,295 --> 01:37:53,224
Yes, yes.

1785
01:37:53,224 --> 01:37:55,601
Lock it up, lock it up, lock it up.

01:37:59,958 --> 01:38:00,791
Alright.

1792
01:38:01,710 --> 01:38:03,424
- [Errol] You sure this is a legal park?

1793
01:38:03,424 --> 01:38:04,294
- [Sinclaire] It's Saturday night,

1794
01:38:04,294 --> 01:38:06,907
you can park anywhere.

1795
01:38:06,907 --> 01:38:08,137

1800
01:38:17,070 --> 01:38:18,968
- It is the Great Maxine.

1801
01:38:18,968 --> 01:38:19,801
- Maxine!

1802
01:38:20,901 --> 01:38:21,818
Very style.

1803
01:38:23,520 --> 01:38:24,353

that nice guy I met.

1812
01:38:59,942 --> 01:39:01,359
Don't ask Maxine.

I don't want you to get
the wrong impression.

You know, I'm not usually like that.

1817
01:39:18,273 --> 01:39:22,125
I'm actually a hard working,
innovative designer.

1818
01:39:22,125 --> 01:39:25,458

1820
01:39:35,623 --> 01:39:38,456

He says it make me feel good.

1823
01:39:49,574 --> 01:39:51,222
No, no, don't take both.

1824
01:39:51,222 --> 01:39:52,055
No.

1825
01:39:53,049 --> 01:39:53,882

♫ Jungle, jungle ♫

1832
01:40:15,303 --> 01:40:18,321
- Can we start to get on with the night?

1833
01:40:18,321 --> 01:40:19,801
♫ That's right 'cause I made you look

1834

1837
01:40:27,776 --> 01:40:29,811
- No, back off.

1838
01:40:29,811 --> 01:40:31,161
I told you I'm waiting for a phone.

1839
01:40:31,161 --> 01:40:32,494
It's an urgency.

1840
01:40:34,074 --> 01:40:35,734
(phone rings)

1841
01:40:35,734 --> 01:40:37,127
- Boris?

1842
01:40:37,127 --> 01:40:38,294
Oh, thank god.

1843
01:40:39,277 --> 01:40:40,209
No what?

1844
01:40:40,209 --> 01:40:42,181
I haven't asked you anything yet.

1845
01:40:42,181 --> 01:40:44,732
Shut up, just shut up and listen to me.

1846
01:40:44,732 --> 01:40:46,232
It's an emergency.

1847
01:40:54,284 --> 01:40:55,117
What?

1848
01:40:55,117 --> 01:40:56,681
Okay, let's go.

1849
01:40:56,681 --> 01:40:57,514
- You're drunk.

1850
01:40:57,514 --> 01:40:58,533
- I'm not.

1851
01:40:58,533 --> 01:40:59,849
I had a little wine at dinner,

1852
01:40:59,849 --> 01:41:00,749
a couple of martinis.

1853
01:41:00,749 --> 01:41:01,851
That's all, I swear.

1854
01:41:01,851 --> 01:41:03,912
- Well then, why did you get me down here?

1855
01:41:03,912 --> 01:41:04,745
- Because--

1856
01:41:04,745 --> 01:41:06,183
- I thought you were in trouble.

1857
01:41:06,183 --> 01:41:07,249
- You're stoned.

1858
01:41:07,249 --> 01:41:08,082
- No.

1859
01:41:08,082 --> 01:41:09,332
- Yes, you are.

1860
01:41:12,468 --> 01:41:15,592
- Say hello to my
important Japanese contact.

1861
01:41:15,592 --> 01:41:17,629
- [Manuel] What the
hell did you do to her?

1862
01:41:17,629 --> 01:41:18,557
- I didn't do anything.

1863
01:41:18,557 --> 01:41:19,723
It was her idea to come here.

1864
01:41:19,723 --> 01:41:21,679
I didn't give her the pills.

1865
01:41:21,679 --> 01:41:22,512
I fucked up.

1866
01:41:22,512 --> 01:41:24,354
- [Manuel] Fuck, what did she take?

1867
01:41:24,354 --> 01:41:25,704
- [Sylvie] I don't know.

1868
01:41:25,704 --> 01:41:27,657
- [Manuel] Let's go, I'm
late for party in Brooklyn.

1869
01:41:27,657 --> 01:41:29,004
- [Slyvie] No, we gotta help her.

1870
01:41:29,004 --> 01:41:29,837
- [Manuel] Who's we?

1871
01:41:29,837 --> 01:41:30,754
- Ha ha ha!

1872
01:41:31,934 --> 01:41:34,851
- [Manuel] She is really fucked up.

1873
01:41:37,357 --> 01:41:40,440
Come on, let's take her out the back.

1874
01:41:42,839 --> 01:41:43,756
- Ha ha ha!

1875
01:41:46,849 --> 01:41:50,315
Then I hit this guy with a nightstick,

1876
01:41:50,315 --> 01:41:52,562
but he don't go down.

1877
01:41:52,562 --> 01:41:53,395
I waive it!

1878
01:41:53,395 --> 01:41:56,478
- No, no! (laughing)

1879
01:41:57,912 --> 01:41:59,477
- I seen this shit,

1880
01:41:59,477 --> 01:42:01,477
kung fu movie, ha ha ha.

1881
01:42:03,496 --> 01:42:05,496
I was gonna fuck him up!

1882
01:42:08,098 --> 01:42:09,408
Then my back went out!

1883
01:42:09,408 --> 01:42:12,916
(laughing hysterically)

1884
01:42:12,916 --> 01:42:15,666
(loud footsteps)

1885
01:42:16,720 --> 01:42:18,386
- You hear that?

1886
01:42:18,386 --> 01:42:21,311
- No, I didn't hear nothin', man.

1887
01:42:21,311 --> 01:42:23,844
Hey, hey, you're doin'.

1888
01:42:23,844 --> 01:42:24,677
Put that away, bro.

1889
01:42:24,677 --> 01:42:25,510
- Yeah.

1890
01:42:26,830 --> 01:42:27,663
Yeah.

1891
01:42:29,935 --> 01:42:30,768
Yeah.

1892
01:42:32,787 --> 01:42:34,244
Yeah.

1893
01:42:34,244 --> 01:42:35,077
- Yo.

1894
01:42:35,077 --> 01:42:36,727
- Yeah.

1895
01:42:36,727 --> 01:42:37,871
(snoring)

1896
01:42:37,871 --> 01:42:38,704
- Yo.

1897
01:42:40,064 --> 01:42:42,826
(grunting)

1898
01:42:42,826 --> 01:42:43,659
- Yeah.

1899
01:42:50,987 --> 01:42:55,154
(screaming)
(upbeat music)

1900
01:42:59,240 --> 01:43:02,318
(radio static drowns speaker)

1901
01:43:02,318 --> 01:43:05,068
(trains rattles)

1902
01:43:19,715 --> 01:43:23,048
(mellow elevator music)

1903
01:43:35,537 --> 01:43:36,370
- Oh ...

1904
01:43:38,527 --> 01:43:41,027
I forgot my purse at the club.

1905
01:43:42,058 --> 01:43:43,891
I forgot my portfolio!

1906
01:43:56,322 --> 01:43:59,405
- [Manuel] Come on, Sylvie, let's go.

1907
01:44:13,272 --> 01:44:14,105
- Mmm...

1908
01:44:15,036 --> 01:44:16,430
Mmm,

1909
01:44:16,430 --> 01:44:17,263
mmm.

1910
01:44:18,394 --> 01:44:21,626
- [Man In Black] Do I get any?

1911
01:44:21,626 --> 01:44:23,808
(laughing)

1912
01:44:23,808 --> 01:44:26,003
- Aren't there enough
chairs in this place?

1913
01:44:26,003 --> 01:44:29,099
Why can't you sit on a chair, huh?

1914
01:44:29,099 --> 01:44:31,875
- You know Mami, I think I
hear Papi calling for you.

1915
01:44:31,875 --> 01:44:32,708
- So do I.

1916
01:44:34,580 --> 01:44:35,413
- Oh.

1917
01:44:43,048 --> 01:44:45,298
(giggling)

1918
01:44:46,216 --> 01:44:47,299
- She's fine!

1919
01:44:48,593 --> 01:44:51,426
You dog. (growls)

1920
01:44:55,812 --> 01:44:57,689
(speaking in foreign language)

1921
01:44:57,689 --> 01:44:59,120
- It's good, right?

1922
01:44:59,120 --> 01:45:01,245
- What's she doin' messin' with you?

1923
01:45:01,245 --> 01:45:02,545
- I'm a businessman,

1924
01:45:02,545 --> 01:45:03,712
Import export.

1925
01:45:13,841 --> 01:45:14,969
- Yo, what are you doin'?

1926
01:45:14,969 --> 01:45:15,919
You live here?

1927
01:45:15,919 --> 01:45:16,752
- No.

1928
01:45:18,807 --> 01:45:19,890
- Chill, man.

1929
01:45:21,245 --> 01:45:23,335
- Don't walk away.

1930
01:45:23,335 --> 01:45:24,918
I'm talking to you.

1931
01:45:27,955 --> 01:45:29,622
You don't desert me.

1932
01:45:35,540 --> 01:45:38,623
- Hey, baby, you look fantastic.

1933
01:45:38,623 --> 01:45:40,171
- This dress doesn't fit me.

1934
01:45:40,171 --> 01:45:41,765
And it has a label in it.

1935
01:45:41,765 --> 01:45:43,151
Made in Taiwan.

1936
01:45:43,151 --> 01:45:44,474
Made in Taiwan, Ramon?

1937
01:45:44,474 --> 01:45:46,253
Made in Taiwan?

1938
01:45:46,253 --> 01:45:47,900
- It's smokin'!

1939
01:45:47,900 --> 01:45:48,733
- Right, Vic.

1940
01:45:48,733 --> 01:45:49,646
- Oh, I'm into it.

1941
01:45:49,646 --> 01:45:51,275
- How can you do this to me?

1942
01:45:51,275 --> 01:45:52,801
Did you get this off a bargain rack?

1943
01:45:52,801 --> 01:45:53,634
- Let me explain.

1944
01:45:53,634 --> 01:45:54,946
- No, I don't wanna hear it.

1945
01:45:54,946 --> 01:45:57,361
How can you do this fucking shit to me?

1946
01:45:57,361 --> 01:45:59,230
- Hey, I don't like it
when you use that language.

1947
01:45:59,230 --> 01:46:00,063
You sound common.

1948
01:46:00,063 --> 01:46:02,008
- Fuck that, you made me look common.

1949
01:46:02,008 --> 01:46:04,059
- No, no, no, no, no, it looks good.

1950
01:46:04,059 --> 01:46:05,676
- [Marisol] What happened to my dress?

1951
01:46:05,676 --> 01:46:09,013
- [Ramon] You don't know what
I did to get you that dress.

1952
01:46:09,013 --> 01:46:10,688
- [Voiceover] C-train to Coney Island.

1953
01:46:10,688 --> 01:46:13,521
Next stop Dekalb Avenue, Brooklyn.

1954
01:46:24,502 --> 01:46:26,904
- Look that Italian lady wanted
me to pay her $500 dollars

1955
01:46:26,904 --> 01:46:28,004
for that dress.

1956
01:46:28,004 --> 01:46:29,250
I don't got that kinda money.

1957
01:46:29,250 --> 01:46:31,216
- What do you mean?

1958
01:46:31,216 --> 01:46:32,299
- Okay, look.

1959
01:46:34,482 --> 01:46:37,935
It is not exactly how I told you.

1960
01:46:37,935 --> 01:46:39,519
You see,

1961
01:46:39,519 --> 01:46:40,928
I was robbed, baby.

1962
01:46:40,928 --> 01:46:42,082
- Ooo!

1963
01:46:42,082 --> 01:46:43,953
Are you tryin' to play me, Ramon?

1964
01:46:43,953 --> 01:46:45,599
Like one of those project women?

1965
01:46:45,599 --> 01:46:46,432
'Cause if you are,

1966
01:46:46,432 --> 01:46:48,548
you can take your sorry
ass outta my sights.

1967
01:46:48,548 --> 01:46:50,538
- You know, you are some piece of work,

1968
01:46:50,538 --> 01:46:51,371
you know that?

1969
01:46:51,371 --> 01:46:53,320
You know, fuck you, if
your pageant is all that.

1970
01:46:53,320 --> 01:46:55,416
I busted my ass for you,

1971
01:46:55,416 --> 01:46:57,249
and you want me to go?

1972
01:47:05,165 --> 01:47:07,990
You really want me to go?

1973
01:47:07,990 --> 01:47:12,071

1974
01:47:12,071 --> 01:47:14,071

that his boss Albani Krug,

2172
01:56:05,497 --> 01:56:08,358

returned to the store.

2173

2177
