819
00:41:08,833 --> 00:41:10,574
And my future star, Truth.

820
00:41:10,602 --> 00:41:12,912
I think we're going to update
your wardrobe a little bit.

821
00:41:12,937 --> 00:41:16,077
Okay, go with me,
Justin Timberlake meets Usher

822
00:41:16,107 --> 00:41:18,246
with just a dash of will.i.am.

823
00:41:18,877 --> 00:41:20,515
Cool, I'm down with that.

824
00:41:20,545 --> 00:41:22,786
Great, 'cause I got big plans.

825
00:41:22,847 --> 00:41:24,326
For real? Talk to me.

826
00:41:24,516 --> 00:41:26,996
I just got off the phone
with The Rap Grand Slam people,

827
00:41:27,018 --> 00:41:29,624
and they're looking for a headline act.

828
00:41:29,788 --> 00:41:30,926
What?

829
00:41:30,955 --> 00:41:32,662
(SQUEALING IN EXCITEMENT)

830
00:41:33,191 --> 00:41:34,397
Yes! I can't believe this.

831
00:41:34,425 --> 00:41:37,804
I mean, that's cool,
I'm the headline at Grand Slam.

832
00:41:37,829 --> 00:41:40,036
A, don't touch me.
B, what, are you insane?

833
00:41:40,064 --> 00:41:42,305
No, Roxie's gonna be the headline act.
Not you.

834
00:41:42,533 --> 00:41:43,671
KRIS: Oh.

835
00:41:44,102 --> 00:41:46,673
What? The Grand Slam wants me?

836
00:41:46,904 --> 00:41:48,315
That's right.

837
00:41:48,373 --> 00:41:49,579
You seem surprised.

838
00:41:49,607 --> 00:41:53,487
Well, you know, they usually go
for more traditional soul vocalists.

839
00:41:53,511 --> 00:41:54,581
(LAUGHS)

840
00:41:54,612 --> 00:41:56,421
She means real singers.

841
00:41:58,216 --> 00:42:00,924
No, I mean real old-school singers,

842
00:42:00,952 --> 00:42:04,593
not new, hot and flashy singers
such as yourself.

843
00:42:04,856 --> 00:42:07,530
Well, I made a few phone calls,
stroked a few egos

844
00:42:07,559 --> 00:42:11,564
and I convinced them that Roxie, here,
is going to help boost their ticket sales.

845
00:42:12,363 --> 00:42:13,603
I don't know, Lyla.

846
00:42:13,631 --> 00:42:16,077
I mean, The Grand Slam audience
isn't very forgiving.

847
00:42:16,100 --> 00:42:18,979
They don't care how many CDs
you've sold, you just better be good.

848
00:42:19,404 --> 00:42:21,406
Yeah. And you will be.

Okay. Okay, who are you guys?

Oh, you came to work?

Levi, I should've called.

858
00:42:47,632 --> 00:42:50,135
Yeah, you should have.
I had a full house last night.

859
00:42:50,301 --> 00:42:55,614
Sorry. I forgot and I fell asleep.
Just in a really weird zone.

860
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:58,777
- Weird zone, huh?
- Yeah.

861
00:42:59,811 --> 00:43:01,119
Is this about that girl, Roxie?

862
00:43:03,748 --> 00:43:06,126
No. No. I mean,
why would you say that?

863
00:43:06,784 --> 00:43:11,164
Just look at you,
your shoulders are all slumped,

864
00:43:11,189 --> 00:43:13,533
you're lookin' all lost and pitiful.

865
00:43:13,558 --> 00:43:15,469
(LAUGHING)
That girl's got your nose wide open.

866
00:43:15,693 --> 00:43:16,967
Is it that obvious?

867
00:43:16,995 --> 00:43:19,202
Yes, it is. Yes, it is.

868
00:43:19,931 --> 00:43:22,434
Did you tell her the truth?
That you're Truth?

869
00:43:22,467 --> 00:43:23,571
Not exactly.

870
00:43:23,801 --> 00:43:25,212
What does that mean?

871
00:43:25,670 --> 00:43:28,412
Well, Kris is into her and he asked me
if I would help him hook up with her.

872
00:43:28,439 --> 00:43:31,249
So, for now, Roxie is going to
think that Kris is Truth.

873
00:43:31,709 --> 00:43:33,950
What? Man, that is just dumb! No.

874
00:43:33,978 --> 00:43:35,719
Listen, now you tell Kris
that you were feelin' her first

875
00:43:35,747 --> 00:43:36,953
and he needs to back on up!

876
00:43:36,981 --> 00:43:38,255
I can't do that.

877
00:43:38,282 --> 00:43:40,523
I mean, me and Kris been homies
since we were, like, five years old.

878
00:43:40,551 --> 00:43:41,689
I don't wanna be a hater.

879
00:43:41,986 --> 00:43:45,092
All right, Cyrus, there's nothing wrong

880
00:43:45,123 --> 00:43:47,660
with you tryin' to be
a good friend to Kris.

881
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:51,600
But if you use that
as an excuse to not man-up

882
00:43:51,629 --> 00:43:53,631
because you're afraid
you might get rejected?

883
00:43:55,666 --> 00:44:00,137
Okay, I can understand that, too.
But you can't live like that forever.

884
00:44:02,407 --> 00:44:04,512
Ah, yeah, I thought so.

885
00:44:05,009 --> 00:44:07,853
You won't tell your daddy you work here
because he won't approve.

886
00:44:07,879 --> 00:44:10,018
You freeze up
when Bling gets in your face

887
00:44:10,048 --> 00:44:12,050
and it's time for you
to get up on that stage.

888
00:44:12,083 --> 00:44:15,553
And then you get tongue-tied when
it comes to telling Roxie how you feel.

889
00:44:15,586 --> 00:44:18,499
A girl like Roxie
would never go for a guy like me.

890
00:44:18,523 --> 00:44:20,560
I mean, look at me and look at Kris.

891
00:44:20,591 --> 00:44:25,131
He's cool, good-looking,
got that swagger.

893
00:44:28,332 --> 00:44:30,403
Kris is a perfect match for Roxie.

894
00:44:30,935 --> 00:44:32,846
Hey, that's not true.

895
00:44:32,870 --> 00:44:36,682
You just got to speak up for yourself
and be who you really are.

896
00:44:36,708 --> 00:44:37,982
Who am I really?

897
00:44:38,376 --> 00:44:39,753
You're Truth!

898
00:44:39,944 --> 00:44:41,150
Oh.

899
00:44:41,379 --> 00:44:43,791
Yeah. And Truth is a bad cat!

900
00:44:43,815 --> 00:44:44,885
He is?

901
00:44:44,916 --> 00:44:47,795
Yeah! Truth won
the Atlanta Records rap contest.

902
00:44:47,819 --> 00:44:50,299
He got skills. He's smooth.
He got that sound.

903
00:44:50,321 --> 00:44:51,925
And you know what?

904
00:44:53,024 --> 00:44:54,059
That's you.

905
00:44:56,527 --> 00:44:57,801
I guess that is me.

906
00:44:57,862 --> 00:45:00,468
Yeah, but Roxie wouldn't know it.

907
00:45:00,498 --> 00:45:02,978
I mean, how can you or Kris
even call yourselves "Truth"

908
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:05,674
when y'all both
are just living one big lie?

909

want and then do somethin' about it.

Oh, that flattering article in Ether?

984
00:49:38,876 --> 00:49:40,856
Yeah, I mean, people think
they know about music,

985
00:49:40,878 --> 00:49:41,982
but don't know a thing.

986
00:49:42,013 --> 00:49:44,687
Like that vocoder you use,
just because it's the "in" thing.

987
00:49:44,715 --> 00:49:47,525
It's a choice.
I can tell you can sing a lil' bit.

988
00:49:48,185 --> 00:49:49,255
A "lil' bit"?

989
00:49:49,287 --> 00:49:51,858
I mean, you ain't given me nothin' more
than what I've heard on the radio,

990
00:49:51,889 --> 00:49:52,959
but I've got a good ear.

991
00:49:52,990 --> 00:49:55,664
Oh, really,
Mr. DJ-Engineering Lip-Syncher?

992
00:49:55,927 --> 00:49:58,737
So, you got any other music
besides your pop hits in your vault?

993
00:49:58,762 --> 00:50:00,400
Yeah, I've got a few special ones

994
00:50:00,431 --> 00:50:02,468
for those who can think
outside the voice box.

995
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:05,310
But Lyla says that vocoder's
the "in" thing right now.

996
00:50:05,336 --> 00:50:06,406
And she really knows the business, so.

997
00:50:06,604 --> 00:50:08,641
Not everyone who sells uses one.

998
00:50:09,006 --> 00:50:12,112
Well, I mean, I know my voice is good,
but I don't know if it's special.

999
00:50:12,143 --> 00:50:13,713
You know, to be just belting out tunes.

1000
00:50:13,744 --> 00:50:16,691
I remember when you sang in church
and you were like eight years old.

1001
00:50:16,714 --> 00:50:18,216
(CHUCKLES) You remember that?

1002
00:50:18,249 --> 00:50:21,628
Yes, of course. The little girl with
the big voice. You were awesome.

1003
00:50:21,652 --> 00:50:23,029
I don't know about all that.

1004
00:50:23,220 --> 00:50:26,258
Okay. Yeah, you were raw,
but the voice was there.

1005
00:50:26,290 --> 00:50:28,793
You've got a really great sound
if you ever care to bring it out.

1006
00:50:28,826 --> 00:50:29,998
That sounds like a challenge.

1007
00:50:30,861 --> 00:50:34,001
It's more of a nudge. Maybe someday
I can hear some of your other music.

1008
00:50:34,398 --> 00:50:35,536

R&B and Hip-Hop.

What else do you love?

1015
00:50:58,656 --> 00:51:05,574
Oh, Jazz, rock, country, salsa,
gospel, reggae, opera.

1016
00:51:05,596 --> 00:51:06,734
Opera?

1017
00:51:06,764 --> 00:51:09,506
Oh, yeah. Pavarotti? He's the bomb.

1018
00:51:09,733 --> 00:51:13,078
Bocelli, too. I also like female opera
singers, like, Maria Callas...

1019
00:51:13,103 --> 00:51:14,241

1020

1026
00:51:27,785 --> 00:51:29,924
Yeah, I just think it brings
more foundation to the sound.

1027
00:51:29,954 --> 00:51:32,491
You know, every note says something.

1028
00:51:32,890 --> 00:51:35,837
And when it's all strung together,
they should tell their own story.

As I look amongst you all...

1148
00:58:37,247 --> 00:58:40,490
I said, as I look out amongst you all...

1149
00:58:41,118 --> 00:58:45,567
I see many God-fearing,
righteous souls.

1150
00:58:46,757 --> 00:58:50,899
But, a few of us have lost their way.

1151
00:58:51,161 --> 00:58:53,971
Many of us were raised the right way,

1152
00:58:53,997 --> 00:58:57,467
but some of us
just can't resist temptation.

1153
00:58:58,468 --> 00:59:01,745
Now, I know you do a little prayer
every now and then

1154
00:59:01,772 --> 00:59:03,752
when things get a little dicey,

1155
00:59:03,774 --> 00:59:08,951
but one day of praying won't erase
all the years of betraying the goodness

1156
00:59:08,979 --> 00:59:10,458
you was raised with.

1157
00:59:10,981 --> 00:59:14,758
So, you see, the church,
we can be forgiving.

1158
00:59:15,285 --> 00:59:18,823
But even our patience can get thin.

1159
00:59:19,656 --> 00:59:23,160
You see, you can't walk
with the Devil on Monday,

1160
00:59:23,527 --> 00:59:26,531
and then with the Lord on a Sunday.

1161
00:59:26,563 --> 00:59:30,204
Yeah, yeah, see, yeah,
you can't dance like a vixen,

1162
00:59:30,233 --> 00:59:33,077
and then ask God to do the fixin'.

1163

then don't want me to say, "Wake up."

has a no lip-synch policy,

01:07:15,465 --> 01:07:18,002
Wait. What are you saying?

1307
01:07:18,201 --> 01:07:20,875
I'm saying Kris deserves
somebody who's real.

1308

Am I even worthy enough to be his girl?

1309

throw up in my mouth.

I'm here to apologize to Roxie.

1317
01:07:49,032 --> 01:07:53,606
Roxanne, I'd like to apologize
for my behavior in church on Sunday.

1318
01:07:53,636 --> 01:07:57,550
My righteousness was sinful,
and I'm sorry.

1319

It's okay.

1320
01:08:03,079 --> 01:08:07,687
Cyrus, may I ask
what business you have here?

1321
01:08:07,917 --> 01:08:09,954
Listen, Cyrus, I need you to get to work.

1322
01:08:13,056 --> 01:08:16,265
The place is a mess, and I'll never
have it ready in time for opening.

1323
01:08:17,160 --> 01:08:18,537
You work here?

1324
01:08:19,295 --> 01:08:21,775
Yeah. But just part-time.
The part where I'm not at the church.

1325
01:08:21,831 --> 01:08:23,242
'Cause that's my priority.

1326
01:08:23,633 --> 01:08:27,342
How could you disrespect me
like this, Cyrus?

1327
01:08:27,370 --> 01:08:29,611
Do you know how this makes me look?

1328
01:08:29,672 --> 01:08:31,481
This isn't about you, Dad, okay.

1329
01:08:31,508 --> 01:08:32,953
It's about the music.
It's what I'm good at.

1330
01:08:32,976 --> 01:08:35,115
If I wasn't doing this
I'd be disrespecting myself.

We will continue this conversation
in private.

1332

No.

Excuse me?

1335
01:08:55,765 --> 01:08:57,904
I'm not going. Levi needs me here.

1336
01:08:57,967 --> 01:09:00,573
I have a job to do,
and that would not be fair to him.

1337

Oh.

1338
01:09:07,811 --> 01:09:09,813

the right thing to do, Jacob.

I saw Cyrus. Honey, he works there.

- (GROANS) You found out.
- What? You knew?

We need to talk. Honey...

Hey. You okay?

01:10:11,441 --> 01:10:13,148
Yeah. I think Dad's upset.

1348
01:10:14,877 --> 01:10:18,882
I'm more than just upset.
I'm disappointed.

1349
01:10:18,948 --> 01:10:20,655
But you don't understand.
I'm a songwriter.

I don't care what you are.

1351
01:10:23,086 --> 01:10:26,499
I don't care if Jesus himself told you
to go up in that club and get a job.

1352
01:10:26,723 --> 01:10:29,260
He was testing you.
And you failed that test.

Will you at least just look at it?

1354

Cyrus, not another word.

1355
01:10:33,196 --> 01:10:35,142
From this point on,
you're on punishment.

1356
01:10:35,165 --> 01:10:37,475
You will not set foot in that club again.

from You Got Served.

Cyrus, I know about your show.
And before you say another word,

1512
01:20:40,369 --> 01:20:44,647
I've been reading your song lyrics.
And I've actually enjoyed them.

Once I got past the fact
that they were rap songs.

1514
01:20:49,545 --> 01:20:52,549
See, Son, I've realized
I've been focused

1515
01:20:52,581 --> 01:20:55,528
on the type of music
as opposed to its message.

1516
01:20:56,152 --> 01:21:01,602
And your songs have messages
of caring, of sacrifice, devotion.

Good Christian values.

1518
01:21:05,261 --> 01:21:10,677
So maybe I've been too harsh
to put all rap into one box.

Look, Roxie, I am sorry. All right?

Cyrus and I, we never meant to
hurt you. He did it for me.

I saw you looking all fine and
I thought that we'd be great together.

that picture with me and Cyrus in it?

You thought I was the rapper and
he was, like, my roadie or something.

He's not wrong. It's show business.

1813
01:37:59,641 --> 01:38:01,882
I was the one who asked Cyrus
to help me trick you.

1814
01:38:02,377 --> 01:38:04,857
And he saw you feeling me
and me feeling you

1815
01:38:04,879 --> 01:38:06,756
and he just wanted to do
what was right, you know?

1816
01:38:08,249 --> 01:38:11,059
Of course, then I started feeling
every girl in Atlanta.

Yeah.

that you were looking for,

1819
01:38:16,558 --> 01:38:18,538
that's you and Cyrus. All right?
