1
00:00:22,322 --> 00:00:25,291
Let's walk through that
night again, shall we?

2
00:00:25,392 --> 00:00:26,926
You said the two of
you were fighting.

3
00:00:27,026 --> 00:00:28,028
It's not what I said.

4
00:00:28,128 --> 00:00:29,329
I said we were having an argument.

5
00:00:29,429 --> 00:00:31,097
How many times do I have
to tell you people this?

6
00:00:31,197 --> 00:00:33,032
As many times as it takes
to work through it, Matthew.

7
00:00:33,133 --> 00:00:34,834
You know that.

8
00:00:34,934 --> 00:00:37,871
As many times as it takes to
find the truth about that night.

9
00:00:37,971 --> 00:00:39,272
You don't want to hear the truth.

10
00:00:39,372 --> 00:00:41,241
You want to hear what you
want to hear.

11
00:00:41,341 --> 00:00:42,742
And what do I want to hear?

12
00:00:42,842 --> 00:00:44,844
That I had something to do
with her disappearance.

13
00:00:44,944 --> 00:00:46,646
Did you?

14
00:00:46,746 --> 00:00:49,115
Sure, I did.

15
00:00:49,215 --> 00:00:51,217
I picked a spot.
I drove us out there.

16
00:00:51,317 --> 00:00:52,786
But I did not take her.

17
00:00:52,886 --> 00:00:54,587
So, who did?

18
00:00:58,658 --> 00:01:00,593
Matthew!

19
00:01:00,693 --> 00:01:02,395
Rachel!

20
00:01:03,863 --> 00:01:05,365
Rachel!

21
00:01:08,001 --> 00:01:09,369
Rachel!

22
00:01:17,544 --> 00:01:19,045
You know, Doc.

23
00:01:19,145 --> 00:01:22,182
I think the question you should
be asking isn't who took her.

24
00:01:22,282 --> 00:01:23,883
But what do they want with her?

25
00:01:23,983 --> 00:01:27,120
And with the rest of us?

26
00:03:38,585 --> 00:03:41,254
Now after Rachel disappeared,
you moved.

27
00:03:41,354 --> 00:03:42,622
Yeah.

28
00:03:42,722 --> 00:03:43,923
And why is that?

29
00:03:44,023 --> 00:03:46,292
'Cause I needed to be near her.

30
00:03:46,392 --> 00:03:48,561
To where she was taken.

31
00:04:57,764 --> 00:05:00,133
But if she vanished as you said,

32
00:05:00,233 --> 00:05:03,136
what were you looking for, exactly?

33
00:05:03,236 --> 00:05:06,939
Anything.
Any sign of her or the ship.

34
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:09,008
Look, I knew she wasn't dead.

35
00:05:09,108 --> 00:05:12,845
Don't ask me why.
But I knew.

36
00:05:12,945 --> 00:05:15,348
Unfortunately, I seem
to be the only one.

37
00:05:15,448 --> 00:05:18,217
Yeah, let's talk about
Sheriff Espinosa.

38
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:22,088
From the reports I read, he seemed
particularly interested in your case.

39
00:05:22,188 --> 00:05:23,756
Do you know why that is?

40
00:05:23,856 --> 00:05:26,092
Besides the fact he was a
major prick?

41
00:05:38,705 --> 00:05:40,606
I just know he was always there.

42
00:05:40,707 --> 00:05:44,243
Everywhere I went,
everywhere I looked.

43
00:05:44,343 --> 00:05:45,745
He was there.

44
00:05:57,490 --> 00:05:59,492
Find anything today?

45
00:06:03,296 --> 00:06:04,664
Yeah.

46
00:06:07,467 --> 00:06:09,736
What's it been now?

47
00:06:09,836 --> 00:06:11,037
Almost a year.

48
00:06:24,517 --> 00:06:25,985
You ready?

49
00:06:26,085 --> 00:06:28,654
Sure you don't have to go
to the bathroom or anything?

50
00:06:28,755 --> 00:06:30,723
Last stop before we enter the wild.

51
00:06:30,823 --> 00:06:34,360
I'm good.
Thanks for asking.

52
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:35,928
Okay.

53
00:06:47,507 --> 00:06:49,208
You know, Matthew.

54
00:06:49,308 --> 00:06:51,144
I don't know if this is some
kind of

55
00:06:51,244 --> 00:06:52,612
sick game you're playing.

56
00:06:52,712 --> 00:06:54,080
Or if it's some kind
of elaborate cover up.

57
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:56,048
And, frankly,
I don't give a shit either way.

58
00:06:56,149 --> 00:07:00,820
Now I've heard your story, what,
must be a hundred times now.

59
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:05,625
And I have to say, you are
one believable motherfucker.

60
00:07:08,294 --> 00:07:11,097
Except I'm not buying it.

61
00:07:11,197 --> 00:07:13,866
Not one minute of it.

62
00:07:17,436 --> 00:07:21,073
People don't just vanish

63
00:07:21,174 --> 00:07:25,378
into thin air ever.

64
00:07:25,478 --> 00:07:28,848
There is always a nasty
little reason for it.

65
00:07:30,850 --> 00:07:32,585
And you?

66
00:07:39,425 --> 00:07:41,694
I'm betting you got
the ugliest, dirtiest,

67
00:07:41,794 --> 00:07:45,097
nastiest little reason
I've ever seen.

68
00:07:45,198 --> 00:07:46,766
But don't you worry.

69
00:07:46,866 --> 00:07:49,368
One of these days sooner or later,
you're gonna slip.

70
00:07:49,468 --> 00:07:52,371
And when you do,
I'm gonna be right there.

71
00:07:52,471 --> 00:07:54,073
I'll be right back.

72
00:08:02,114 --> 00:08:04,050
He was even there,

73
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:06,686
that night with Alicia.

74
00:08:06,786 --> 00:08:08,754
And what night was that?

75
00:08:18,197 --> 00:08:21,968
Matthew, you can do this.

76
00:08:22,068 --> 00:08:23,002
Matthew.

77
00:08:23,102 --> 00:08:24,036
I don't wanna do this.

78
00:08:24,136 --> 00:08:25,438
I don't wanna talk about this anymore.

79
00:08:25,538 --> 00:08:27,840
I wanna go to my room!

80
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:31,344
Right now!

81
00:08:31,444 --> 00:08:36,349
Okay. We can end the session here.

82
00:08:36,449 --> 00:08:38,251
We'll come back around to it later.

83
00:08:40,219 --> 00:08:42,021
It's open.

84
00:10:13,846 --> 00:10:17,416
♪ I'm alone

85
00:10:22,355 --> 00:10:23,389
What's wrong?

86
00:10:29,395 --> 00:10:31,197
It's so peaceful out here.

87
00:10:32,665 --> 00:10:34,066
Really, what is it?

88
00:10:34,166 --> 00:10:35,101
Don't say nothing.

89
00:10:35,201 --> 00:10:38,938
'Cause nothing's really something.

90
00:10:39,038 --> 00:10:42,074
It's been, what, five,
almost six years.

91
00:10:42,174 --> 00:10:45,745
And I was just thinking when
we're gonna take the next step.

92
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:56,122
Do you want to have a family
with me?

93
00:10:57,990 --> 00:11:00,092
Little ones running around?

94
00:11:05,231 --> 00:11:08,067
Look, I love you.

95
00:11:08,167 --> 00:11:10,803
I always will and nothing
will ever change that,

96
00:11:10,903 --> 00:11:12,638
But you've got to figure out
what you want.

97
00:11:12,738 --> 00:11:15,307
Because I can only wait for
so long.

98
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:26,552
I'll be right back.

99
00:11:26,652 --> 00:11:28,154
I gotta go pee.

100
00:11:32,625 --> 00:11:34,360
Rachel?

101
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:35,461
Yeah?

102
00:11:37,997 --> 00:11:40,266
I have some three ply in
the truck if you need it.

103
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,502
Of course, you do.

104
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:46,305
I'll be right back.

105
00:11:53,412 --> 00:11:54,413
(Mutters)

106
00:12:12,531 --> 00:12:13,966
Matthew?

107
00:12:21,807 --> 00:12:23,809
Matthew? Is that you?

108
00:12:30,816 --> 00:12:32,218
Matthew!

109
00:12:53,272 --> 00:12:55,107
Honey, you okay?

110
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:08,921
Rachel?

111
00:13:09,021 --> 00:13:12,424
You're all sweaty.

112
00:13:12,525 --> 00:13:14,360
Having a nightmare again?

113
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:18,297
I... I...

114
00:13:21,767 --> 00:13:23,335
Come on back to bed.

115
00:13:23,435 --> 00:13:25,905
It's cold without you.

116
00:13:43,656 --> 00:13:45,224
This isn't real.

117
00:13:51,730 --> 00:13:55,167
It's okay, it's okay.

118
00:13:55,267 --> 00:13:55,935
It's okay.

119
00:13:56,035 --> 00:13:57,503
Honey, you okay?

120
00:13:57,603 --> 00:13:58,737
It's okay.

121
00:13:58,837 --> 00:14:00,906
It's okay.
Just relax.

122
00:14:01,006 --> 00:14:02,074
What are you doing?

123
00:14:02,174 --> 00:14:03,475
What are you doing to me?

124
00:14:03,576 --> 00:14:05,911
I'm not doing anything.
Just calm down.

125
00:14:06,011 --> 00:14:08,714
It's okay, it's okay.
Just relax.

126
00:14:08,814 --> 00:14:12,151
What are you doing? Get the
fuck off me! What are you doing?

127
00:14:12,251 --> 00:14:13,786
You had a night terror.

128
00:14:13,886 --> 00:14:16,088
Your doctor's on his way down.

129
00:14:16,188 --> 00:14:18,023
Just relax. Just relax!

130
00:14:18,123 --> 00:14:19,525
Get off me!
Relax!

131
00:14:19,625 --> 00:14:20,793
Get off me!

132
00:14:20,893 --> 00:14:21,961
Matthew.

133
00:14:22,061 --> 00:14:24,930
Matthew, it's Dr. Vans.
Just relax.

134
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:26,265
Everything's gonna be fine.

135
00:14:26,365 --> 00:14:28,634
We're gonna fix you up
just like last time.

136
00:14:28,734 --> 00:14:29,835
Last time?

137
00:14:29,935 --> 00:14:30,970
What are you talking about?

138
00:14:31,070 --> 00:14:32,204
Get that thing away from me!

139
00:14:32,304 --> 00:14:34,573
Hold him down!

140
00:15:06,705 --> 00:15:10,109
Look, I cleared my schedule
out next weekend.

141
00:15:10,209 --> 00:15:13,979
Let's go camping.
Get out of L.A.

142
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:15,247
Away from everything.

143
00:15:15,347 --> 00:15:19,918
Just you, me

144
00:15:20,019 --> 00:15:21,854
and desert sky.

145
00:15:21,954 --> 00:15:23,922
What do you say?

146
00:15:24,023 --> 00:15:25,958
Come here.

147
00:15:26,058 --> 00:15:26,959
Take that as a yes?

148
00:16:16,542 --> 00:16:18,010
Matthew.

149
00:16:18,110 --> 00:16:19,378
Rachel!

150
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:23,415
We don't have much time.
Listen to me.

151
00:16:23,515 --> 00:16:25,984
Remember this place.
They're bringing me back.

152
00:16:26,085 --> 00:16:27,219
What? Who's bringing you back?

153
00:16:27,319 --> 00:16:28,354
Shh!

154
00:16:28,454 --> 00:16:31,023
Rachel, talk to me!
Who's bringing you back?

155
00:17:20,172 --> 00:17:21,440
Good morning.

156
00:17:23,642 --> 00:17:27,413
I hear last night got a little interesting.
You wanna tell me about it?

157
00:17:27,513 --> 00:17:30,015
No.

158
00:17:30,115 --> 00:17:31,550
You gotta talk to somebody, Matthew.

159
00:17:31,650 --> 00:17:34,686
That's how this works.
You talk, I listen.

160
00:17:34,787 --> 00:17:35,921
We find answers.

161
00:17:36,021 --> 00:17:39,024
And maybe stop having these episodes.

162
00:17:39,124 --> 00:17:42,027
Episodes?

163
00:17:42,127 --> 00:17:43,695
What, is this 1927?

164
00:17:45,330 --> 00:17:46,865
You wanna get out of here?

165
00:17:46,965 --> 00:17:50,569
I don't feel like being cooped
up in this office all day.

166
00:18:12,791 --> 00:18:14,293
Oh, I got him.

167
00:18:23,569 --> 00:18:26,405
I'm gonna tell you what
I tell all my patients.

168
00:18:26,505 --> 00:18:29,108
Being up here is a privilege.

169
00:18:29,208 --> 00:18:31,310
Now you can try to escape if
you want,

170
00:18:31,410 --> 00:18:33,145
but the jump will kill you
and the ladder's too slow.

171
00:18:33,245 --> 00:18:36,215
They'll be waiting
for you at the bottom.

172
00:18:36,315 --> 00:18:39,518
Either way, you lose your privileges.

173
00:18:45,090 --> 00:18:47,359
Watch your step.

174
00:18:48,861 --> 00:18:50,629
Come on out.

175
00:18:53,232 --> 00:18:54,566
Here we are.

176
00:18:55,734 --> 00:18:57,302
Ah.

177
00:18:59,304 --> 00:19:01,306
We got air in the lungs.

178
00:19:02,441 --> 00:19:05,043
What do you say we...

179
00:19:05,143 --> 00:19:07,079
Try to break through
the static a little bit.

180
00:19:07,179 --> 00:19:08,647
Shall we?

181
00:19:10,249 --> 00:19:12,718
Have you always had trouble
sleeping, Matthew?

182
00:19:12,818 --> 00:19:14,753
No.

183
00:19:14,853 --> 00:19:16,355
When did it start?

184
00:19:22,194 --> 00:19:26,398
I guess when she started to
visit me.

185
00:19:29,668 --> 00:19:31,770
What do you mean, visit you?

186
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:47,319
Where are you going so early?

187
00:19:47,419 --> 00:19:49,421
Gonna go check out this area
in the desert.

188
00:19:49,521 --> 00:19:51,189
It's been getting a lot
of activity lately.

189
00:19:51,290 --> 00:19:53,025
Where is it?

190
00:19:53,125 --> 00:19:54,526
Near...

191
00:20:00,999 --> 00:20:03,468
Near the place...

192
00:20:06,305 --> 00:20:07,839
I last saw you.

193
00:20:26,692 --> 00:20:27,993
Tell me.

194
00:20:28,093 --> 00:20:29,828
Never.

195
00:20:54,253 --> 00:20:56,521
That's how I knew she was
still out there.

196
00:20:56,622 --> 00:20:59,558
I'd spend days searching for her...

197
00:21:40,198 --> 00:21:42,067
I'll be right back.

198
00:21:43,568 --> 00:21:45,671
I'll be right back.

199
00:21:59,651 --> 00:22:01,887
Only to come home and find
her there.

200
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:14,766
Just in time.
Dinner's ready.

201
00:22:17,969 --> 00:22:22,140
Mmm, I made your favorite: Enchiladas.

202
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:24,309
Mm, smells delicious.

203
00:22:24,409 --> 00:22:26,244
But not as delicious as you.

204
00:22:26,344 --> 00:22:28,346
Mmm, careful there.

205
00:22:28,447 --> 00:22:29,548
We might just be skipping dinner

206
00:22:29,648 --> 00:22:31,283
and going straight to dessert.

207
00:22:31,383 --> 00:22:32,884
I'll bring the whipped cream.

208
00:22:32,984 --> 00:22:34,519
Dirty boy.

209
00:22:34,619 --> 00:22:37,222
Go wash up.
I'll set the table.

210
00:22:43,328 --> 00:22:46,064
You'll never guess
what I found today.

211
00:22:48,867 --> 00:22:51,903
There's this mountain lion
ripped to shreds.

212
00:22:52,003 --> 00:22:53,939
Almost unrecognizable.

213
00:22:54,039 --> 00:22:57,175
It got me wondering what
kind of animal out here

214
00:22:57,275 --> 00:22:58,610
could do something like that.

215
00:23:01,513 --> 00:23:02,647
Do you know?

216
00:23:09,488 --> 00:23:11,056
Rachel?

217
00:23:12,724 --> 00:23:14,793
Rachel, did you hear me?

218
00:23:31,643 --> 00:23:35,013
Ever wake up from a dream, Doc?

219
00:23:35,113 --> 00:23:37,482
A dream so good, you're mad
at yourself for waking up?

220
00:23:37,582 --> 00:23:39,351
So you roll over

221
00:23:39,451 --> 00:23:40,452
and try like hell to fall
back asleep

222
00:23:40,552 --> 00:23:42,187
to find your way back there?

223
00:23:42,287 --> 00:23:43,455
Yes.

224
00:23:45,423 --> 00:23:48,493
That's all I did.
Fight to get back there.

225
00:23:50,695 --> 00:23:53,832
Till it got to the point where I couldn't
fall asleep in the first place.

226
00:24:08,613 --> 00:24:10,649
Then they sent me to a shrink.

227
00:24:10,749 --> 00:24:13,251
It's worse than you.

228
00:24:13,351 --> 00:24:16,455
Are you scared of these nightmares?

229
00:24:16,555 --> 00:24:17,989
They're just dreams.

230
00:24:20,358 --> 00:24:22,427
Is that how you explain it?

231
00:24:22,527 --> 00:24:23,962
What?

232
00:24:24,062 --> 00:24:25,697
With Rachel?

233
00:24:25,797 --> 00:24:28,633
Are you trying to get
a confession out of me?

234
00:24:28,733 --> 00:24:29,968
No, I'm not here for that.

235
00:24:30,068 --> 00:24:31,536
This is why I don't talk
to people like you.

236
00:24:31,636 --> 00:24:34,339
You want to twist everything
I say to fit your story.

237
00:24:34,439 --> 00:24:35,774
So why don't you tell me what happened?

238
00:24:35,874 --> 00:24:37,476
I told you what happened.

239
00:24:37,576 --> 00:24:38,844
Why don't you tell me again?

240
00:24:38,944 --> 00:24:42,047
Why?
You think my story's gonna change?

241
00:24:42,147 --> 00:24:44,416
I realize this is a
difficult situation for you

242
00:24:44,516 --> 00:24:45,584
so I'm gonna skip the bullshit

243
00:24:45,684 --> 00:24:47,485
and cut to the chase.

244
00:24:47,586 --> 00:24:50,188
In four weeks, you'll appear
in front of a judge

245
00:24:50,288 --> 00:24:52,023
who will determine your fate.

246
00:24:52,123 --> 00:24:55,527
Based partially on my
psychoanalysis of you.

247
00:24:55,627 --> 00:24:59,297
I did not kill Rachel.

248
00:24:59,397 --> 00:25:01,099
Then she disappeared?

249
00:25:01,199 --> 00:25:02,367
Yes.

250
00:25:02,467 --> 00:25:05,570
Then tell me about that night.

251
00:25:05,670 --> 00:25:07,572
Read the report.

252
00:25:07,672 --> 00:25:10,175
I've read the reports.

253
00:25:10,275 --> 00:25:12,711
I want you to tell me.

254
00:25:12,811 --> 00:25:15,280
Or do you just want to sit
in this room alone?

255
00:25:17,816 --> 00:25:19,317
I'd rather be alone.

256
00:25:21,453 --> 00:25:24,322
It's the only thing that's real.

257
00:25:58,490 --> 00:26:01,226
Looks like somebody's got
your feathers all ruffled up.

258
00:26:01,326 --> 00:26:02,227
What do you want?

259
00:26:02,327 --> 00:26:04,262
I got a question for you.

260
00:26:04,362 --> 00:26:07,198
I woke up this morning.
Checked my calendar.

261
00:26:07,299 --> 00:26:08,900
It's just something I do.

262
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:12,704
I noticed the day is October 12.

263
00:26:12,804 --> 00:26:15,140
Planning on heading back out
to the scene of the crime?

264
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:18,176
The only crime is you
calling off the search

265
00:26:18,276 --> 00:26:19,544
and coming after me.

266
00:26:19,644 --> 00:26:21,112
Well, now that sounds
like hard feelings.

267
00:26:21,212 --> 00:26:23,048
Here I thought you were
all over our little run in.

268
00:26:23,148 --> 00:26:24,616
You mean, arresting me for murder?

269
00:26:24,716 --> 00:26:27,485
Well, now see, the way I saw it,

270
00:26:27,585 --> 00:26:30,088
everything kept pointing to
one person:

271
00:26:30,188 --> 00:26:31,890
You.

272
00:26:31,990 --> 00:26:35,493
I'm sure you can understand
my point of view.

273
00:26:35,593 --> 00:26:38,797
No.

274
00:26:38,897 --> 00:26:42,801
People do crazy things sometimes.

275
00:26:42,901 --> 00:26:46,204
Yeah. Sure do, don't we?

276
00:27:08,293 --> 00:27:11,363
And right before I actually
thought I was going crazy,

277
00:27:11,463 --> 00:27:13,231
I met Alicia.

278
00:27:30,281 --> 00:27:32,884
Didn't expect to see you
in here tonight.

279
00:27:32,984 --> 00:27:34,419
Yeah.

280
00:27:34,519 --> 00:27:36,321
The usual.

281
00:27:39,491 --> 00:27:41,059
Any progress?

282
00:27:43,428 --> 00:27:44,629
Keep it open, will you?

283
00:27:44,729 --> 00:27:46,898
You got it.
Thank you.

284
00:27:57,409 --> 00:27:58,943
Mind if I sit here?

285
00:28:00,111 --> 00:28:01,980
Be my guest.

286
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:03,214
Thanks.

287
00:28:04,449 --> 00:28:05,683
I'm Alicia.

288
00:28:05,784 --> 00:28:07,252
Matthew.

289
00:28:07,352 --> 00:28:08,953
I know.

290
00:28:12,390 --> 00:28:13,958
Don't worry.

291
00:28:14,059 --> 00:28:17,729
I'm not with any government
or law enforcement agency.

292
00:28:18,997 --> 00:28:20,899
Just making conversation.

293
00:28:25,003 --> 00:28:29,240
Besides, you kind of look
like you could use a friend.

294
00:28:29,340 --> 00:28:31,576
You're not from around here,
are you?

295
00:28:31,676 --> 00:28:32,844
Boston.

296
00:28:32,944 --> 00:28:34,746
So what are you doing out here?

297
00:28:34,846 --> 00:28:36,948
I was transferred here nine
months ago.

298
00:28:37,048 --> 00:28:39,050
I'm a Communication Analyst

299
00:28:39,150 --> 00:28:41,352
for a private contractor
called Gemini.

300
00:28:41,453 --> 00:28:45,523
Deep Space, Area 246.

301
00:28:46,658 --> 00:28:48,026
Black Base near Death Valley?

302
00:28:48,126 --> 00:28:51,329
Yeah. How'd you know that?

303
00:28:52,931 --> 00:28:55,100
The desert hides many
secrets in plain sight.

304
00:28:57,202 --> 00:28:59,337
You just gotta know
what you're looking at.

305
00:29:04,309 --> 00:29:07,378
Well, I heard you sold everything,

306
00:29:07,479 --> 00:29:09,414
moved out here,

307
00:29:09,514 --> 00:29:13,284
and spend your days driving
across the desert

308
00:29:13,384 --> 00:29:15,553
searching for your dead girlfriend.

309
00:29:15,653 --> 00:29:16,821
She's not dead.

310
00:29:20,358 --> 00:29:22,093
She's alive?

311
00:29:24,762 --> 00:29:27,232
So what exactly do you analyze?

312
00:29:36,174 --> 00:29:37,075
Listen.

313
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:51,356
You've heard that noise before,
haven't you?

314
00:29:51,456 --> 00:29:52,724
What do you know about it?

315
00:29:52,824 --> 00:29:54,659
It's an E.T. Communication Signal.

316
00:29:54,759 --> 00:29:57,162
These files go back for years,

317
00:29:57,262 --> 00:30:01,699
but I was only hired to
analyze the most recent one.

318
00:30:01,799 --> 00:30:03,535
From October 12 of last..

319
00:30:03,635 --> 00:30:07,005
That's the same day that Rachel..
Yes, it is.

320
00:30:09,774 --> 00:30:12,443
I don't know any specifics.

321
00:30:12,544 --> 00:30:15,013
What I do know is

322
00:30:15,113 --> 00:30:16,981
you guys weren't alone that night.

323
00:30:21,653 --> 00:30:24,389
So I have to confess something.

324
00:30:24,489 --> 00:30:28,893
Curiosity isn't the only thing
that made me want to find you.

325
00:30:32,564 --> 00:30:35,333
You know, the same thing
happened to my sister?

326
00:30:43,141 --> 00:30:45,210
What happened to your sister?

327
00:30:47,345 --> 00:30:48,513
She disappeared.

328
00:30:51,783 --> 00:30:54,052
Right around the same area
as Rachel.

329
00:30:54,152 --> 00:30:58,389
It's Rachel, right?
By Rainbow Basin?

330
00:31:00,024 --> 00:31:01,192
Seems like a lot of weird stuff

331
00:31:01,292 --> 00:31:05,063
has been happening up there lately.

332
00:31:05,163 --> 00:31:07,932
So what do you want from me?

333
00:31:09,067 --> 00:31:10,501
I want your help.

334
00:31:12,503 --> 00:31:14,372
Look, I'm not trying
to put this on you.

335
00:31:14,472 --> 00:31:16,474
But I have driven back
and forth from L.A.

336
00:31:16,574 --> 00:31:17,642
for as long as I can remember

337
00:31:17,742 --> 00:31:19,477
and I can't find anything.

338
00:31:19,577 --> 00:31:22,447
And you're the only person who was
with someone when they disappeared.

339
00:31:22,547 --> 00:31:26,351
So I was hoping that you had,
I don't know,

340
00:31:26,451 --> 00:31:29,087
seen something or heard something.

341
00:31:29,187 --> 00:31:32,257
I'm sorry, but I can't help you.

342
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:43,668
Okay.

343
00:31:47,905 --> 00:31:51,442
Well, look, here's my card.

344
00:31:51,542 --> 00:31:55,446
If you think of anything,
just give me a call.

345
00:32:02,687 --> 00:32:04,622
Guess I'll leave you alone now.

346
00:32:08,126 --> 00:32:09,661
Nice to meet you.

347
00:33:02,747 --> 00:33:04,849
93 East.

348
00:33:04,949 --> 00:33:06,584
(Mutters)

349
00:33:09,887 --> 00:33:11,756
1193.

350
00:33:21,833 --> 00:33:24,969
One, two, three, four, five, six,

351
00:33:25,069 --> 00:33:27,739
seven, eight, nine, ten.

352
00:33:29,874 --> 00:33:31,809
Ten miles?

353
00:33:39,817 --> 00:33:41,652
You're out there somewhere.

354
00:34:04,175 --> 00:34:07,879
I just, uh,

355
00:34:07,979 --> 00:34:12,483
wanted to apologize for last night.

356
00:34:17,155 --> 00:34:18,656
It's just you're the first
person I've talked to

357
00:34:18,756 --> 00:34:21,025
in a year that hasn't treated
me like a lunatic or a murderer.

358
00:34:21,125 --> 00:34:23,961
So...

359
00:34:24,062 --> 00:34:26,697
I guess I'm out of practice.

360
00:34:44,382 --> 00:34:46,517
Sorry about the mess.

361
00:34:46,617 --> 00:34:50,521
I'm going through a bit of a
nomadic phase in my life right now.

362
00:34:50,621 --> 00:34:53,124
I know the feeling.

363
00:34:55,993 --> 00:34:59,030
So what can you tell me about 246?

364
00:34:59,130 --> 00:35:01,299
What makes it special?

365
00:35:03,935 --> 00:35:06,904
Well, that's kind of the thing.

366
00:35:07,004 --> 00:35:08,506
It's not really.

367
00:35:08,606 --> 00:35:12,410
I mean, it is a hot spot for
these E.T. Com Signals.

368
00:35:12,510 --> 00:35:15,813
But there are hundreds
of them all over the world

369
00:35:15,913 --> 00:35:18,249
all spread out in seemingly
random locations.

370
00:35:18,349 --> 00:35:20,017
That's why the government
hired Gemini

371
00:35:20,118 --> 00:35:22,854
to start tracking them in the
late 70s.

372
00:35:25,323 --> 00:35:26,824
And what have you found?

373
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:30,528
Not much.

374
00:35:33,498 --> 00:35:36,634
The frequency of the signals
changes in strength,

375
00:35:36,734 --> 00:35:41,372
but I can tell you, the last two
years has been particularly strong.

376
00:35:41,472 --> 00:35:43,274
Have other people disappeared?

377
00:35:43,374 --> 00:35:44,609
Oh, absolutely.

378
00:35:44,709 --> 00:35:46,344
And all the stories you read about

379
00:35:46,444 --> 00:35:50,381
lights in the sky,
Missing Time Phenomena.

380
00:35:51,916 --> 00:35:57,021
People like my sister
and Rachel just vanishing.

381
00:35:57,121 --> 00:35:59,323
Why doesn't the government
or Gemini step in

382
00:35:59,423 --> 00:36:01,459
and do something about it?

383
00:36:01,559 --> 00:36:02,460
Truth?

384
00:36:04,929 --> 00:36:08,032
I don't think they want
to do anything about it.

385
00:36:08,132 --> 00:36:10,101
Right now, it's all about research.

386
00:36:10,201 --> 00:36:11,903
Observe and report.

387
00:36:12,003 --> 00:36:14,772
They don't want people freaking
out about extraterrestrial life

388
00:36:14,872 --> 00:36:17,808
when we can't even keep our
shit together on our own planet.

389
00:36:17,909 --> 00:36:21,512
In the meantime,
a bunch of campers go missing

390
00:36:21,612 --> 00:36:24,515
or people claim they saw
mysterious lights

391
00:36:24,615 --> 00:36:26,384
outside their bedroom window.

392
00:36:26,484 --> 00:36:29,720
They can just write
those people off as lunatics.

393
00:36:31,155 --> 00:36:33,391
Or murderers.

394
00:36:45,303 --> 00:36:48,472
I was just trying to get us out
of the city for a couple of days.

395
00:36:48,573 --> 00:36:52,677
If I could go back,
I would take her anywhere else.

396
00:36:55,313 --> 00:36:56,914
Anywhere else.

397
00:37:01,519 --> 00:37:04,255
Look, I know we just met

398
00:37:04,355 --> 00:37:07,391
and you don't know me from Eve,

399
00:37:07,491 --> 00:37:10,094
but I really think I can help
you, Matthew.

400
00:37:10,194 --> 00:37:12,964
And maybe we won't find the answers,

401
00:37:13,064 --> 00:37:16,500
but I don't know.

402
00:37:16,601 --> 00:37:19,637
Maybe we can start
asking the right questions.

403
00:37:21,739 --> 00:37:25,443
As it turns out,
we didn't have to look that hard.

404
00:37:25,543 --> 00:37:27,812
'Cause she came back to me.

405
00:37:29,914 --> 00:37:32,183
When she got back from the hospital,

406
00:37:32,283 --> 00:37:36,921
could you sleep then?

407
00:37:37,021 --> 00:37:38,322
Hospital?

408
00:37:38,422 --> 00:37:40,591
What are you talking about, hospital?

409
00:37:40,691 --> 00:37:42,627
You mean the one 50 miles
from nowhere in the desert?

410
00:37:42,727 --> 00:37:46,097
But when she came back,
did she change?

411
00:37:46,197 --> 00:37:47,632
Was she different?

412
00:37:54,472 --> 00:37:57,742
When she got back?

413
00:37:57,842 --> 00:38:01,078
Remember this place.
They're bringing me back.

414
00:38:20,798 --> 00:38:21,866
Rachel.

415
00:38:22,967 --> 00:38:24,135
Rachel.

416
00:38:24,235 --> 00:38:26,203
Matthew.

417
00:39:14,819 --> 00:39:16,687
Is it really..

418
00:39:19,156 --> 00:39:21,125
Yes, you're home.

419
00:39:30,568 --> 00:39:32,236
Am I really home?

420
00:39:32,336 --> 00:39:34,739
Yes, you are.

421
00:40:04,368 --> 00:40:06,203
I'm home?

422
00:40:09,507 --> 00:40:12,476
Yes, you're home.

423
00:41:18,142 --> 00:41:19,710
Rachel!

424
00:41:23,514 --> 00:41:24,849
Rachel! Rach..

425
00:42:14,231 --> 00:42:15,699
You waited for me.

426
00:42:16,834 --> 00:42:19,103
I wasn't gonna stop till
I found you.

427
00:42:25,075 --> 00:42:26,043
Here.

428
00:42:27,578 --> 00:42:29,346
You wore it?

429
00:42:41,125 --> 00:42:43,761
How did you know where
to find her out there?

430
00:42:46,397 --> 00:42:47,898
She told me.

431
00:42:47,998 --> 00:42:50,601
She told you.
And how did she do that?

432
00:42:50,701 --> 00:42:52,803
Did she call you to tell you
where she was? Don't do that.

433
00:42:52,903 --> 00:42:54,872
Do what?
Make fun of me.

434
00:42:54,972 --> 00:42:56,740
I'm not making fun of you.
Look, I'm not crazy, okay?

435
00:42:56,840 --> 00:42:58,242
Nobody said you are.

436
00:42:58,342 --> 00:43:00,811
You are! You're painting me
to be a crazy person.

437
00:43:00,911 --> 00:43:03,614
And I'm not, okay?
I know what I saw out there!

438
00:43:03,714 --> 00:43:04,949
I saw what I saw!

439
00:43:05,049 --> 00:43:06,650
Matthew, I know you believe that.

440
00:43:06,750 --> 00:43:07,785
I know you do.

441
00:43:07,885 --> 00:43:09,453
No, no, no!
You said hospital!

442
00:43:09,553 --> 00:43:11,822
What are you talking about?
What hospital?

443
00:43:11,922 --> 00:43:14,558
Matthew! The hospital's not important.

444
00:43:14,658 --> 00:43:16,360
I want you to forget
about the hospital.

445
00:43:16,460 --> 00:43:19,563
Now just take a breath.

446
00:43:19,663 --> 00:43:21,999
Let's focus on Rachel.
Let's focus on Rachel.

447
00:43:22,099 --> 00:43:24,234
Now you're out there.
You find her.

448
00:43:24,335 --> 00:43:26,403
You bring her back.
What happened next?

449
00:44:15,152 --> 00:44:16,687
Matthew.

450
00:46:59,449 --> 00:47:03,153
What are you doing here?
How do you know where I live?

451
00:47:03,253 --> 00:47:05,355
I just want to see how you're doing.

452
00:47:05,455 --> 00:47:06,890
I'm fine.

453
00:47:06,990 --> 00:47:09,526
'Cause you look a little jumpy.

454
00:47:18,402 --> 00:47:20,571
I appreciate you stopping by,
but I think... All right, fine.

455
00:47:20,671 --> 00:47:24,575
So you remember that Communication
Signal I told you about?

456
00:47:24,675 --> 00:47:27,044
Yeah, what about it?

457
00:47:27,144 --> 00:47:29,313
Well, I heard it again.

458
00:47:49,800 --> 00:47:51,668
You heard it, didn't you?

459
00:47:51,768 --> 00:47:54,371
No. I didn't hear anything.

460
00:47:54,471 --> 00:47:55,872
You're lying.

461
00:47:55,973 --> 00:47:57,074
I'm not lying.

462
00:47:57,174 --> 00:48:00,344
What are you hiding?
Nothing.

463
00:48:01,511 --> 00:48:02,446
Matthew.

464
00:48:03,714 --> 00:48:05,315
You should go now.

465
00:48:10,554 --> 00:48:11,455
Okay.

466
00:48:19,162 --> 00:48:20,964
Call me if you wanna talk.

467
00:48:32,342 --> 00:48:34,745
Why is it so dark in here?

468
00:48:34,845 --> 00:48:37,948
The light hurts my eyes.

469
00:48:48,625 --> 00:48:50,527
They're pretty.

470
00:49:01,672 --> 00:49:03,640
You're so beautiful.

471
00:49:05,942 --> 00:49:07,110
What's wrong?

472
00:49:07,210 --> 00:49:10,314
Nothing.
Nothing's wrong.

473
00:49:12,716 --> 00:49:17,754
Right now in this moment,
everything's right.

474
00:49:19,089 --> 00:49:21,191
It couldn't be more right.

475
00:49:32,803 --> 00:49:34,771
Do you remember?

476
00:49:36,073 --> 00:49:37,341
Some things.

477
00:49:37,441 --> 00:49:40,344
Mostly it's like seeing
for the first time.

478
00:50:03,400 --> 00:50:04,701
We look...

479
00:50:06,536 --> 00:50:08,238
Happy?

480
00:50:40,704 --> 00:50:43,140
Things were good, I think.

481
00:50:43,240 --> 00:50:45,342
Things were good.

482
00:50:45,442 --> 00:50:48,578
Things were good.
Good.

483
00:50:48,678 --> 00:50:50,180
Everything was good.

484
00:50:50,280 --> 00:50:52,449
All right, that's good.
That's good, Matthew.

485
00:50:52,549 --> 00:50:54,751
Why don't we stop there for today?

486
00:50:54,851 --> 00:50:56,453
I think that's a good place.

487
00:50:56,553 --> 00:51:00,490
Come on. Come on.
We'll get something to eat.

488
00:52:51,434 --> 00:52:52,769
Are you all right?

489
00:52:54,871 --> 00:52:56,940
Something's happening to me.

490
00:52:58,875 --> 00:53:00,577
What do you mean?

491
00:53:07,851 --> 00:53:09,419
Rachel?

492
00:53:13,189 --> 00:53:14,925
Please don't hate me.

493
00:53:17,193 --> 00:53:18,261
No.

494
00:53:20,163 --> 00:53:22,132
I love you.

495
00:53:22,232 --> 00:53:24,234
I'll take care of you.

496
00:54:01,972 --> 00:54:03,773
Hey! Let me outta here!

497
00:54:03,873 --> 00:54:05,508
I gotta get outta here!

498
00:54:05,609 --> 00:54:07,811
Matthew, calm down!
Now what's going on in there?

499
00:54:07,911 --> 00:54:09,980
Carl! Carl, you gotta
let me outta here.

500
00:54:10,080 --> 00:54:10,981
Something's wrong!

501
00:54:11,081 --> 00:54:12,148
I gotta see Stewart!

502
00:54:12,249 --> 00:54:14,351
Dr. Stewart is in group.
You know that.

503
00:54:14,451 --> 00:54:15,585
Now just calm down!

504
00:54:15,685 --> 00:54:17,954
What the hell's going on in there?

505
00:54:19,723 --> 00:54:20,824
Matthew?

506
00:54:49,386 --> 00:54:51,321
(Muttering)

507
00:54:56,526 --> 00:54:58,795
Arianna, can you..

508
00:54:58,895 --> 00:55:00,430
What the hell did you do to
me, Stewart?

509
00:55:00,530 --> 00:55:03,099
Matthew, what are you
doing out of your room?

510
00:55:03,199 --> 00:55:04,267
What did you plant in my head?

511
00:55:04,367 --> 00:55:05,535
Why are you taking her from me?

512
00:55:05,635 --> 00:55:08,271
I want you to calm down right now

513
00:55:08,371 --> 00:55:10,974
or I'll have you restrained.

514
00:55:11,074 --> 00:55:12,108
Do you understand me?

515
00:55:12,208 --> 00:55:14,811
Matthew, do you understand me?

516
00:55:29,526 --> 00:55:31,061
Why am I seeing these things?

517
00:55:31,161 --> 00:55:32,462
She was sick.

518
00:55:32,562 --> 00:55:35,331
She was sick,
but she didn't have Cancer.

519
00:55:35,432 --> 00:55:37,000
They took her.

520
00:55:38,568 --> 00:55:41,204
Carl, Doctor Mai.
I need the room.

521
00:55:41,304 --> 00:55:42,839
Thank you.

522
00:55:44,340 --> 00:55:45,475
Matthew, you can stay.

523
00:55:45,575 --> 00:55:47,711
Okay, come clear the room, please?

524
00:55:59,189 --> 00:56:02,025
Now earlier today,
you told me when Rachel

525
00:56:02,125 --> 00:56:03,460
came back everything was good.

526
00:56:03,560 --> 00:56:06,796
So when did that change?

527
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:12,736
It's when they started
calling her.

528
00:57:05,522 --> 00:57:06,656
Babe?

529
00:57:23,106 --> 00:57:24,974
Rachel!

530
00:57:29,979 --> 00:57:31,114
Rachel!

531
00:57:42,492 --> 00:57:44,093
What's wrong?

532
00:57:50,900 --> 00:57:53,169
Unfortunately, those are
all common side effects..

533
00:57:53,269 --> 00:57:56,406
She didn't have Cancer! What about
this you're not understanding?

534
00:57:56,506 --> 00:57:58,408
She never had Cancer.

535
00:57:58,508 --> 00:57:59,742
She went missing for months.

536
00:57:59,843 --> 00:58:02,045
I went out every goddamned
day searching for her.

537
00:58:02,145 --> 00:58:03,580
I had Espinosa up my ass.

538
00:58:31,140 --> 00:58:34,043
There was this mountain
lion ripped to shreds.

539
00:58:34,143 --> 00:58:36,045
Almost unrecognizable.

540
00:58:36,145 --> 00:58:38,781
It's got me wondering
what kind of animal out here

541
00:58:38,882 --> 00:58:40,583
could do something like that.

542
00:58:53,396 --> 00:58:54,864
Anybody home?

543
00:58:56,199 --> 00:58:57,500
Sheriff?

544
00:58:57,600 --> 00:58:59,802
Well, Matthew.
What are you doing here?

545
00:58:59,903 --> 00:59:02,205
Following up on several calls

546
00:59:02,305 --> 00:59:03,339
we apparently had last night

547
00:59:03,439 --> 00:59:04,874
about some kind of disturbance.

548
00:59:04,974 --> 00:59:08,611
Terrible noises like dogs
or coyotes getting tortured.

549
00:59:10,246 --> 00:59:11,748
Tortured coyotes?

550
00:59:11,848 --> 00:59:13,149
You know anything about that?

551
00:59:13,249 --> 00:59:14,484
No. Why would I?

552
00:59:14,584 --> 00:59:16,686
Did you hear anything last night?

553
00:59:16,786 --> 00:59:18,488
Not a thing.
I was asleep.

554
00:59:18,588 --> 00:59:20,390
Well, that's strange.

555
00:59:20,490 --> 00:59:23,359
'Cause all those reports,
every single one of them,

556
00:59:23,459 --> 00:59:26,863
said it came from your property.

557
00:59:26,963 --> 00:59:30,133
I don't know what to tell you, Sheriff.

558
00:59:30,233 --> 00:59:32,368
You know, something
smells like shit back there.

559
00:59:32,468 --> 00:59:33,736
Well, that's exactly it.

560
00:59:33,836 --> 00:59:35,838
Come again?
Manure.

561
00:59:35,939 --> 00:59:38,708
I'm gonna plant some grass in
front there.

562
00:59:38,808 --> 00:59:41,244
Really? You mind if I take a look?
I do mind.

563
00:59:41,344 --> 00:59:43,046
It's none of your business.

564
00:59:43,146 --> 00:59:45,715
I'd appreciate if you
just leave me alone.

565
00:59:45,815 --> 00:59:48,651
I'm just a normal guy trying
to get back on my feet.

566
00:59:50,219 --> 00:59:51,854
Fuck you.

567
00:59:51,955 --> 00:59:55,124
You did not leave that
cozy little Los Angeles home

568
00:59:55,224 --> 00:59:57,961
to come out here to get back
on your feet.

569
00:59:58,061 --> 01:00:00,530
You're lying,
and you're hiding something.

570
01:00:00,630 --> 01:00:01,998
I can taste it.

571
01:00:02,098 --> 01:00:03,766
Anytime you wanna come back
with a search warrant,

572
01:00:03,866 --> 01:00:05,635
you're more than welcome.

573
01:00:05,735 --> 01:00:07,770
As far as I'm concerned,
this is my property.

574
01:00:07,870 --> 01:00:09,739
And you're trespassing.

575
01:00:09,839 --> 01:00:13,676
Well, you got fight.

576
01:00:14,777 --> 01:00:16,179
I'll give you that.

577
01:00:22,285 --> 01:00:23,886
Ask him. Ask Espinosa!

578
01:00:23,987 --> 01:00:26,255
Okay.
Ask Alicia. She knows.

579
01:00:38,501 --> 01:00:40,069
Hey.

580
01:00:50,113 --> 01:00:51,781
So?

581
01:00:53,416 --> 01:00:56,119
I mean, I'm assuming you
didn't just call me here

582
01:00:56,219 --> 01:00:59,122
for a beer and chitchat about life.

583
01:01:00,857 --> 01:01:03,393
I needed to talk to someone.

584
01:01:06,662 --> 01:01:07,730
And...

585
01:01:07,830 --> 01:01:10,066
You have no one else, I know.

586
01:01:10,166 --> 01:01:12,268
What's going on?

587
01:01:13,436 --> 01:01:15,471
I found Rachel.

588
01:01:24,313 --> 01:01:27,150
Alicia and Espinosa are not important.

589
01:01:27,250 --> 01:01:29,052
I want you to just to focus here.

590
01:01:29,152 --> 01:01:32,155
I want you to focus only on Rachel.

591
01:02:42,992 --> 01:02:44,327
Now when she started to change,

592
01:02:44,427 --> 01:02:46,295
why didn't you bring her
into the hospital?

593
01:02:46,395 --> 01:02:47,897
No, no.

594
01:02:47,997 --> 01:02:51,467
She wouldn't..
She wouldn't let me.

595
01:02:53,236 --> 01:02:54,504
I..

596
01:03:18,394 --> 01:03:20,796
What is this?

597
01:03:20,897 --> 01:03:22,765
Where did these bruises come from?

598
01:03:22,865 --> 01:03:24,800
Could you please leave?

599
01:03:24,901 --> 01:03:27,970
Something's happening to you.

600
01:03:31,474 --> 01:03:34,544
Nothing is happening.
Could you just leave?

601
01:03:37,547 --> 01:03:38,614
What are you doing?

602
01:03:38,714 --> 01:03:39,649
Taking you to the hospital.

603
01:03:39,749 --> 01:03:40,883
No!

604
01:03:40,983 --> 01:03:41,984
You need to.

605
01:03:42,084 --> 01:03:43,920
Matthew, listen to me.

606
01:03:44,020 --> 01:03:45,488
I said I'm not going.

607
01:03:45,588 --> 01:03:47,223
Matthew.

608
01:03:48,391 --> 01:03:49,292
Matthew.

609
01:03:57,867 --> 01:04:00,770
No hospitals, no doctors.

610
01:04:00,870 --> 01:04:01,771
But you need to go.

611
01:04:01,871 --> 01:04:03,673
Matthew, promise me.

612
01:04:03,773 --> 01:04:05,174
Say it.

613
01:04:09,612 --> 01:04:12,348
I promise.

614
01:04:12,448 --> 01:04:14,483
No hospital.

615
01:04:21,290 --> 01:04:24,627
Matthew, have you ever heard
of Repressive Memory Syndrome?

616
01:04:27,363 --> 01:04:29,398
I'll take your silence as yes.

617
01:04:29,498 --> 01:04:32,235
So you've been told your
relationships are created

618
01:04:32,335 --> 01:04:34,904
around a memory of a
traumatic experience

619
01:04:35,004 --> 01:04:36,839
which is objectively false,

620
01:04:36,939 --> 01:04:39,175
but in which you believe to
be true.

621
01:04:57,059 --> 01:04:59,161
That's why you're here, Matthew.

622
01:05:01,197 --> 01:05:04,200
Rachel did get sick.

623
01:05:04,300 --> 01:05:08,104
She wasn't abducted.
There was no aliens.

624
01:05:11,674 --> 01:05:13,943
You're lying.
I wouldn't lie to you, Matthew.

625
01:05:14,043 --> 01:05:15,544
No, you're lying to me!

626
01:05:15,645 --> 01:05:16,812
You're bullshitting my head.

627
01:05:16,912 --> 01:05:19,048
You're testing me.

628
01:05:19,148 --> 01:05:22,351
They changed her.
They did this to her.

629
01:05:50,846 --> 01:05:53,316
There is no they.
There's only it.

630
01:05:53,416 --> 01:05:57,820
And it's invisible.
And it's insidious.

631
01:05:57,920 --> 01:06:00,389
And it made you feel powerless.

632
01:06:16,572 --> 01:06:17,740
No!

633
01:06:21,010 --> 01:06:23,646
Rachel, talk to me.
What's going on?

634
01:06:23,746 --> 01:06:28,484
No, no, no.
It can't be both.

635
01:06:36,092 --> 01:06:38,694
I'm changing.

636
01:06:38,794 --> 01:06:40,596
Everything is gonna be okay.

637
01:06:40,696 --> 01:06:41,964
Can't be both ways.

638
01:06:42,064 --> 01:06:45,234
I know I said I'd love you forever.

639
01:06:47,636 --> 01:06:48,804
You have to kill me.

640
01:06:48,904 --> 01:06:50,339
What?
It's the only way.

641
01:06:50,439 --> 01:06:53,008
I need to go now.
No.

642
01:06:53,109 --> 01:06:55,010
Do you love me?
Of course, I love you.

643
01:06:55,111 --> 01:06:57,246
Then kill me.
No!

644
01:06:59,181 --> 01:07:02,118
I need to go now.

645
01:07:07,323 --> 01:07:11,694
Nothing's gonna happen to you,
me or anyone, okay?

646
01:07:11,794 --> 01:07:13,662
It already has.

647
01:07:21,337 --> 01:07:22,538
She dies in that bed.

648
01:07:26,108 --> 01:07:27,743
Rachel, come back to me.

649
01:07:27,843 --> 01:07:30,446
Rachel.
Rachel, look at me!

650
01:07:35,584 --> 01:07:38,788
I should have told you
every day how I felt.

651
01:07:40,823 --> 01:07:43,192
I should have told you
that night in the desert.

652
01:07:44,126 --> 01:07:46,195
Rachel.

653
01:07:48,798 --> 01:07:50,733
She dies in that bed.

654
01:07:50,833 --> 01:07:53,302
I never lose her in the desert.

655
01:07:53,402 --> 01:07:55,104
I never would have said those
things to her.

656
01:07:55,204 --> 01:07:56,472
They're coming.

657
01:07:56,572 --> 01:07:59,508
Everyone I know,
everyone you know will all die.

658
01:08:07,983 --> 01:08:09,385
I remember you.

659
01:08:18,160 --> 01:08:19,695
Rachel?

660
01:08:36,111 --> 01:08:38,147
I'm not gonna hurt you.

661
01:08:58,801 --> 01:09:00,803
Hey.
Hey.

662
01:09:02,738 --> 01:09:04,740
This doesn't exist.

663
01:09:09,945 --> 01:09:11,380
Tonight?

664
01:09:13,082 --> 01:09:14,450
Shit.

665
01:09:16,485 --> 01:09:18,254
Directions are in your email.

666
01:10:36,098 --> 01:10:38,834
Fear does not become you.

667
01:10:38,934 --> 01:10:41,437
You're strong.

668
01:10:41,537 --> 01:10:44,306
You've accepted your becoming.

669
01:10:44,406 --> 01:10:46,375
I've accepted nothing.

670
01:11:07,296 --> 01:11:08,631
Matthew!

671
01:11:22,778 --> 01:11:24,480
I'm on it.

672
01:11:42,865 --> 01:11:45,634
You've changed. You have.

673
01:11:51,040 --> 01:11:53,409
You're strong.

674
01:12:11,660 --> 01:12:15,531
Matthew, they're getting
in my mind. My..

675
01:12:15,631 --> 01:12:18,467
My thoughts aren't mine anymore.

676
01:12:32,514 --> 01:12:34,850
They're all gonna die in the end.

677
01:13:04,313 --> 01:13:06,949
Why are you doing this?

678
01:13:07,049 --> 01:13:09,051
Evolution.

679
01:13:13,122 --> 01:13:15,891
So what's your plan?

680
01:13:15,991 --> 01:13:17,693
Kill us all?

681
01:13:39,515 --> 01:13:41,784
You son of a bitch.

682
01:13:41,884 --> 01:13:43,886
I told you it was only
gonna be a matter of time.

683
01:13:58,934 --> 01:14:00,102
What the fuck?

684
01:14:14,183 --> 01:14:16,518
Come on!

685
01:14:18,053 --> 01:14:20,255
Matthew! Get up!

686
01:14:24,393 --> 01:14:25,494
Come on!

687
01:14:25,594 --> 01:14:26,895
I can't go any farther.

688
01:14:26,995 --> 01:14:28,530
Get up.

689
01:14:33,435 --> 01:14:35,103
Okay, wait here.

690
01:14:55,991 --> 01:14:57,192
Get in.

691
01:15:22,184 --> 01:15:24,253
Matthew?

692
01:15:24,353 --> 01:15:26,355
Matthew, can you hear me?

693
01:15:26,455 --> 01:15:28,223
Come on, stay with me.

694
01:16:01,423 --> 01:16:03,625
Where am I?

695
01:16:05,027 --> 01:16:06,595
You're safe.

696
01:16:18,540 --> 01:16:20,776
What's going on?

697
01:16:24,446 --> 01:16:27,182
Just rest.

698
01:16:27,282 --> 01:16:29,651
Save your strength.

699
01:16:38,760 --> 01:16:40,329
You been playing me this
whole time.

700
01:16:40,429 --> 01:16:42,965
You're one of them!
Where is she?

701
01:16:43,065 --> 01:16:46,602
Charlie! Take me to Rachel!
I want to see Rachel!

702
01:16:49,605 --> 01:16:51,373
Oh, Jesus!

703
01:17:22,938 --> 01:17:25,607
In the end,
the plan just wouldn't hold.

704
01:17:25,707 --> 01:17:27,509
The Submersive Memory
continues to break

705
01:17:27,609 --> 01:17:29,177
at the point of your death.

706
01:17:29,277 --> 01:17:33,548
I'm afraid he's not
a candidate for reintroduction.

707
01:17:33,648 --> 01:17:35,150
I understand.

708
01:17:48,530 --> 01:17:50,732
What happens to him next?

709
01:17:52,801 --> 01:17:56,838
We have protocols for this type of thing.
He'll be dealt with.

710
01:17:56,938 --> 01:17:59,174
Probably sent to the mines.

711
01:18:02,210 --> 01:18:04,112
But it's important for you to understand.

712
01:18:04,212 --> 01:18:08,116
When it's time for us to descend,

713
01:18:08,216 --> 01:18:13,021
it will be people like you that
will help us to our victory.

714
01:18:13,121 --> 01:18:14,923
Of course.

715
01:18:41,783 --> 01:18:44,252
Remember me, Matthew.

716
01:18:46,354 --> 01:18:47,956
Don't leave me.

717
01:18:48,890 --> 01:18:51,593
I will always be with you.

718
01:18:51,693 --> 01:18:53,361
No!

719
01:18:53,462 --> 01:18:56,164
You can't leave me again!

720
01:18:56,264 --> 01:18:58,867
I don't know if I can do it
this time!

721
01:18:58,967 --> 01:19:02,204
Yes, you can.

722
01:19:02,304 --> 01:19:04,206
You're strong.

723
01:19:04,306 --> 01:19:07,342
No, not without you.

724
01:19:07,442 --> 01:19:10,378
You must.

725
01:19:10,479 --> 01:19:12,481
Destiny is within you now.

726
01:19:12,581 --> 01:19:15,417
You must survive.
No! No!

727
01:19:15,517 --> 01:19:17,519
No! No!

728
01:19:17,619 --> 01:19:19,221
I love you.

729
01:19:21,957 --> 01:19:24,025
I'm sorry about Matthew.

730
01:19:26,461 --> 01:19:28,263
I know.

731
01:19:49,084 --> 01:19:50,852
I don't know anything!

732
01:19:50,952 --> 01:19:52,087
Please let me go!

733
01:19:52,187 --> 01:19:54,623
Please, where are you taking me?

734
01:19:54,723 --> 01:19:58,693
Matthew! Matthew, wake up!

735
01:19:58,794 --> 01:20:00,495
Matthew, wake up, please!

736
01:20:00,595 --> 01:20:02,764
Don't let them take me, please!

737
01:20:02,864 --> 01:20:05,300
Matthew!
